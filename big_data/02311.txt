Abstract

A striking prediction in topological insulators is the appearance of the quantized Hall resistance when
the surface states are magnetized. The surface Dirac states become gapped everywhere on the surface,
but chiral edge states remain on the edges. In an applied current, the edge states produce a quantized
Hall resistance that equals the Chern number C = ±1 (in natural units), even in zero magnetic ﬁeld.
This quantum anomalous Hall eﬀect was observed by Chang et al.. With reversal of the magnetic
ﬁeld, the system is trapped in a metastable state because of magnetic anisotropy. Here we investigate
how the system escapes the metastable state at low temperatures (10–200 mK). When the dissipation
(measured by the longitudinal resistance) is ultralow, we ﬁnd that the system escapes by making
a few, very rapid transitions, as detected by large jumps in the Hall and longitudinal resistances.
Using the ﬁeld at which the initial jump occurs to estimate the escape rate, we ﬁnd that raising the
temperature strongly suppresses the rate. From a detailed map of the resistance vs. gate voltage and
temperature, we show that dissipation strongly aﬀects the escape rate. We compare the observations
with dissipative quantum tunneling predictions. In the ultralow dissipation regime, there exist two
temperature scales T1 ∼ 70 mK and T2 ∼145 mK between which jumps can be observed. The jumps
display a spatial correlation that extends over a large fraction of the sample.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the semiconductors known as topological insulators [1–4] (exempliﬁed by Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3 and Bi2Te2Se), strong
spin-orbit interaction together with band inversion lead to electronic surface states which display a Dirac-like linear
dispersion. On each surface, the Dirac states have only one spin degree of freedom, with the spin locked transverse
to the momentum. The node of the Dirac cone is protected against gap formation if time-reversal symmetry (TRS)
prevails (this constrains the nodes to be pinned at time-reversal invariant momenta).

The unusual properties of the surface Dirac states have been intensively investigated by angle-resolved photoemission
(ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and transport experiments. A natural question is what happens
when TRS is broken by inducing a magnetization at the surface? Theory predicts that breaking of TRS opens a gap at
the Dirac node throughout the surface “bulk” [1–4]. However, there remains a conducting edge state that runs around
the perimeter of the sample. The edge state is chiral (it is either right or left-moving depending on the magnetization
vector) and dissipationless (backscattering of the electrons is prohibited). As in the quantum Hall eﬀect (QHE), the
edge state displays a Hall resistance that is rigorously quantized (Ryx = h/e2 where h is Planck’s constant and e the
electron charge) while the longitudinal resistance Rxx vanishes [1–5]. However, the quantization of Ryx occurs even
if the external magnetic ﬁeld H is zero. This phenomenon is known as the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) eﬀect.

The quantization of Ryx in zero ﬁeld was ﬁrst established experimentally by Chang et al. using ultrathin ﬁlms
of Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 [6]. Similar results in related TI ﬁlms were subsequently reported by several groups [7–13].
The topological nature of the Hall quantization produces a hysteretic loop in Ryx that reﬂects the magnetic hysteresis
when H (the applied magnetic ﬁeld) is slowly cycled beyond the coercive ﬁeld Hc. If the system is prepared with
magnetization M (cid:107) H (cid:107) −ˆz, the chiral edge modes lead to Ryx = −h/e2 = -25.812 kΩ. This state is characterized by a
Chern number C = −1. As H changes sign, the system becomes metastable; to exit the metastable state, it undergoes
a very sharp transition to the state with C = 1 and Ryx = +h/e2. Here, we focus on the nature of this transition at
millikelvin temperatures T . In conventional magnets, the hysteretic transition reﬂects the gradual diﬀusive motion
of domain walls. Surprisingly, the transition actually proceeds by large, discrete jumps in Ryx. We ﬁnd that slightly
increasing T suppresses the jump probability. A detailed investigation of how the jump probability varies with H and
T suggests that the jumps reﬂect quantum tunneling events in the presence of dissipation.

II. RESULTS

A. Characterization and benchmarks

2

In the experiment, we used samples of Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 grown on a SrTiO3 substrate by molecular beam
epitaxy to a thickness of 10 nm and cut into Hall bars (0.5 mm × 1 mm) (see Methods and Ref. [11]). As grown,
the surface states are n-doped with the chemical potential lying high above the surface Dirac node. A large, negative
back-gate voltage Vg = -80 V is required to lower µ to the surface Dirac node. Within the optimal gate window -120
< Vg <-80 V (the limits are nominal; they change by ±10% in successive experiments), the Hall resistance Ryx attains
near-ideal quantization at temperature T = 10 mK. Figure 1A shows that, at Hc ∼ 0.14 T, Ryx undergoes narrow
transitions between -1 and +1, with narrow peaks in the resistance Rxx of width ∆H ∼ 20 mT (hereafter, we quote
resistances in units of h/e2).

An important question is the stability of the quantized values Ryx = ±1.

If the magnetization is actually not
spontaneous, Ryx should relax away from the quantized values when H is returned to 0, whereas a truly magnetized
ground state with C = ±1 should display no sign of relaxation. To test this, we prepared the state in positive ﬁeld
H (cid:107) ˆz. We then returned H → 0 and monitored Ryx for a period 8-9 hrs. As shown in Fig. 1B, we do not detect any
sign of relaxation at 49 mK and 72 mK for Vg = -80 V. To us this shows that, at the Hall plateaus, the system is in
the true ground state with C = ±1. Moreover, it remains stable in the limit H → 0 at least to 8-9 hrs.
The expanded scale in Fig. 1C shows that Ryx deviates from 1.0000 by ∼4 parts in 104 within the optimal gating
window. Figure 1D shows in expanded scale the behavior of Rxx away from the peaks. Signiﬁcantly, Rxx at H=0
falls to values < 3 × 10−4 at 10 mK consistent with ultralow dissipation. These benchmarks are comparable to the
best achieved to date [9, 10].

To provide a broader view of the transport behavior at 10 mK, we show in Fig. 2 the curves of Ryx and Rxx
vs. H, with Vg set at values from 0 to -120 V. The Hall curves Ryx (Fig. 2A) remain very close to 1.0000 in the
optimal gate window, but start to fall monotonically as |VG| decreases, reaching 0.03 when Vg = 0 (surface states
strongly n-doped). Throughout the gate interval, -70 to 0 V, the sign of the n-type carriers imparts a gentle slope
to Ryx for ﬁelds |H| > Hc. Turning to the longitudinal resistance, we show in semilog scale the curves of Rxx vs.
H for the same gate voltage values (Fig. 2B). As noted above, Rxx falls to values as low as 3 × 10−4 (in terms of
h/e2) within the ﬁeld window |H| < Hc (see curve at Vg = -90 V). When |H| is increased beyond Hc, the dissipation
increases exponentially. As we tune Vg outside the optimal gate window, the curves of Rxx also increase exponentially,
eventually reaching ∼0.2 when Vg approaches 0. The pattern of an exponential increase in dissipation when either
Vg is tuned outside its optimal window, or |H| is increased above the coercive ﬁeld, implies the existence of a small
energy gap that “protects” the dissipationless state with accurately quantized Ryx. We estimate the activation gap
below (see Sec. II D).

B. Jumps in Rxx and Ryx

The main results – observation of large jumps in Rxx and Ryx – are described in this subsection. At each T , we
prepare the system with Chern number C = −1 (H (cid:107) −ˆz). To investigate the transition C : −1 → 1, we scan H very
slowly (1-10 mT/min) across Hc (left to right in all ﬁgures). Starting at our lowest T (10–50 mK), Ryx displays a
nominally smooth proﬁle as it changes from -1 to 1 (Fig. 3A). The smooth variation, which has a proﬁle that is T
independent in width up to 580 mK, is likely associated with conventional domain-wall motion.
In the interval 50-65 mK, small precursor steps become discernible above an onset ﬁeld Hs. At the characteristic
temperature T1 ∼ 65 mK, we observe the appearance of remarkably large jumps with magnitudes ∆Ryx ∼ 1. Within
the interval T1 → T2 = 145 mK, the jumps appear in a stochastic, yet systematic pattern as shown in Fig. 3B. Their
occurrence is independent of the adopted sweep rate (1-10 mT/min). We focus on the ﬁrst jump, which is always the
largest (in over 50 scans recorded). As T rises above T1, its magnitude ∆Ryx initially increases (curves at 83→ 131
mK). Above 138 mK, ∆Ryx rapidly diminishes to become unresolved. As shown in Fig. 3C, all curves above T2 are
smooth and devoid of jumps. Interestingly, even though jumps are not observed at 10 mK in the ultra-low dissipation
state, they re-appear when we tune Vg to exit the optimal window. In Fig. 3D, Ryx at -90 V is smooth, but jumps
appear when Vg is raised above -40 V. The jumps are reproducibly observed even after repeatedly warming to 300 K.
They are distinct from magnetization steps observed in manganites at T as high as 4 K [14].

The jumps are also prominent in the dissipative channel (curves of Rxx). At low T (10-50 mK), Rxx exhibits a
nominally smooth, asymmetric proﬁle (Fig. 4A). Above T1, large jumps appear at the leading (left) edge while the
trailing edge remains smooth, as the width increases to 38 mT. Figure 4B follows these curves above T2 to 216 mK.
As noted for Ryx, the escape ﬁeld HJ (T ) of the initial jump increases with T . However, in the window 125-138 mK,

3

the jumps now have opposite signs (positive at the leading edge). Jumps observed in Ryx and Rxx when H is swept
in the opposite direction are closely similar (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3).

Figures 4C and 4D show how the two important quantities (the jump magnitude and the initial ﬁeld) vary with
T . As noted, the jump magnitude ∆Ryx is initially small within the precursor interval, but increases rapidly at T1
to saturate at a plateau value ∼1 (Fig. 4C). As T is further raised above T2, ∆Ryx collapses to a value below our
resolution. Above T2 (up to 500 mK), the Hall curves vary smoothly throughout the hysteresis loop. In contrast to
the non-monotonicity of ∆Ryx(T ), the escape ﬁeld HJ (T ) increases steeply from T1 to T2 (solid symbols in Fig. 4D).
It is interesting that HJ is still rising with steepening slope when the jump magnitude falls below resolution above T2.
For comparison, we also plot the gentle decrease of Hc and Hs (open symbols) over the same interval of T (obtained
from curves in Supplementary Fig. S4).

C. Spatial Correlations

An interesting way to study the jumps is provided by simultaneous measurements of Rij across well-separated pairs
of voltage contacts. The resistance Rij,mn is deﬁned as Vmn/Iij where Vmn is the voltage measured across contacts
(m, n) with the current Iij injected at the source contact i and drained at j (see inset, Fig. 5A). A typical pattern
is that a jump in Ryx measured across one pair of contacts barely aﬀects the signal across a diﬀerent pair, but at a
slightly larger H the reverse holds.

Figures 5A and 5B show traces of R14,53 and R14,62 vs. H at T = 105 mK and 120 mK, respectively. In both panels,
the initial jump (at H = 0.129 T) is large across the downstream Hall pair (5,3) while the upstream Hall pair (6,2)
is barely aﬀected. At a larger H (0.133 T), the second jump is prominent in the upstream pair but much smaller in
the downstream pair. Simultaneously, the resistance R14,23 in the right pair (2,3) ﬁrst increases and then decreases
whereas in the left-pair (6,5), R14,65 shows the opposite sequence (Figs. 5C and 5D).

Despite the stochastic nature of the jumps, the overall pattern is systematic and reproducible, especially for the
ﬁrst two jumps in a trace. In Fig. 6 we plot four successive scans of the traces taken successively with T ﬁxed at 86
mK and Vg = −80V . The sample is prepared in the same way in each scan with the sweep rate ﬁxed at 1 mT/min.
Panel A reports the Hall resistances (light curves for the upstream pair, bold curves for downstream). In panel B, we
show the corresponding longitudinal resistance curves (bold curves for the left pair, light curves for the right). The
ﬁrst two jumps are reproducible although the jump magnitudes and HJ can vary by 10%. The variations from one
jump to the next shown here are quite typical of the reproducibility across the whole temperature range investigated
(10 mK to 580 mK).

How fast are the jumps? To minimize extraneous perturbations, all the traces shown above were taken at very slow
ﬁeld-sweep rates (typically 1 mT/min). We have attempted to estimate the duration of the ﬁrst jump ∆t by minimizing
the capacitive loading in the measurement circuitry in the dilution refrigerator. To this end, we sequentially removed
several stages of the ﬁlter elements in the circuit (which increased the noise in the traces), while slowing the ﬁeld scan
to 0.1 mT/min. The ﬁnal trace in this process is measured with only the low-temperature ﬁlter present. The noisy
trace (Fig. 7) shows that ∆t is shorter than 1 ms, the time constant of the remaining ﬁlter.

D. Activation across a small gap

Extending the measurements over a broad range of Vg and T , we ﬁnd that the ultralow dissipation state is protected
by a minigap ∆R ∼ 190 mK. Setting Vg within the optimal gating window (-110 to -75 V) places µ inside ∆R (these
numbers can shift by 10% between runs because of charge trapping at the interface). Once µ exits the minigap,
dissipation rises exponentially.
Figure 8A shows the changes to Ryx and Rxx as Vg is varied from -120 V to 0, with T ﬁxed at 10 mK and H
ﬁxed at ∼0 T (solid triangles) or 1 T (solid circles). The Hall curves (red and magenta symbols) show that, as |Vg|
is decreased, Ryx stays close to the quantum value h/e2 (the optimal gating window) until |Vg| decreases below 70 V
in zero H. Thereafter, Ryx decreases exponentially to 0.03 as Vg → 0. (The lower limit of the optimal window (-70
V in panel a) varies from run to run because of hystereses caused by charge trapping in the SrTiO3 substrate.) The
resistance Rxx at H = 0 (blue triangles) increases exponentially with a lower threshold than Ryx. A ﬁnite ﬁeld (1
T, black circles) lowers the threshold signiﬁcantly. We identify the exponential changes in both Ryx and Rxx with
raising of µ above the upper limit of the gap ∆R by gating.
The magnitude of the minigap ∆R is determined by detailed measurement of the conductance σxx vs. T . From
the semilog plot of σxx vs. 1/T in Fig. 8B, we infer ∆R ∼ 190 mK for H = 33 mT (black squares; H is set slightly
away from 0 to avoid the sharp feature arising from quenching of superconductivity in the In contacts). At 0.5 T,
the equivalent plot gives a slightly smaller ∆R (155 mK), consistent with the steeper increase in the curve with black

symbols in Fig. 8A. Both plots imply that the minigap decreases noticeably with increasing H. This is also consistent
with the gradual increase of the background dissipation discussed in conjunction with Fig. 2B.
The changes to the transport curves induced by varying either Vg or T provide ﬁrm evidence that the ultralow
dissipation state in the QAH state is protected by a minigap ∆R ∼ 190 mK. An exponential increase in the dissipation
is observed when T is increased or when we move µ out of the optimal window by gating. The size of the gap is also
decreased by increasing H beyond 0.5 T. The gradual increase of the background with H, together with the negative
slope of Ryx outside the coercive-ﬁeld window, suggests that the bulk carrier population (n-type) is gradually increased
by H when µ falls outside the optimal window. To summarize the results, we plot schematically the behavior of the
curves ∆R, T1 and T2 in the Vg-T plane (Fig. 9).

III. DISCUSSION

A. Metastability and the eﬀect of T

The reversal of H from the direction in which the system is prepared (H (cid:107) −ˆz) traps the system in a metastable
state (spin ↓) until escape occurs near the coercive ﬁeld. We have investigated the nature of the transition in the
magnetic topological insulator at millikelvin temperatures. In a conventional ferromagnet escape from the metastable
state corresponds to gradual motion of domain walls separating up and down domains, which allows the spin-↑ domain
to expand. This leads to the familiar smooth hysteretic M -H loop. Here, however, the transition which involves both
a change of the Chern number (C = −1 → 1) and the average M displays a rich array of additional features, most
notably the large jumps in Ryx and Rxx in the interval T1 < T < T2 (Figs. 3 and 4). The jumps occur on time scales
shorter than 1 ms. The ﬁrst jump involves reversal of M over roughly half the sample. (As mentioned, we identify
the smooth T -independent variation of Ryx above T2 with conventional domain-wall motion. Below T2, the smooth
variation persists as a background channel between the jumps.)
[In two recent investigations [12, 13] of the transition C = −1 → 1, the variation of Ryx is much broader than
the ones observed here. Instead of jumps in Ryx, a shoulder at C = 0 (zero-Hall conductivity feature) is observed.
Compared to the present sample (thickness 10 nm), the samples used are in the ultrathin limit (5 nm in Ref.
[12]
and 6 nm in Ref. [13]) where hybridization between the states on the two surfaces is expected. Both the presence of
zero-Hall shoulder and the absence of jumps suggest that these ultrathin samples are in a distinctly diﬀerent regime
of QAH behavior from the present sample. The degree of disorder appears to be higher in the ultrathin regime. For
e.g., in the zero-Hall sample [13], the dissipation remains high at 50 mK (Rxx ∼ 4 at H = 0) while accurate Hall
quantization is not attained (Ryx ∼ 0.9).]
state (↑) within a sample in the metastable state (↓). The free energy of a 2D bubble of radius R is

We start by applying the standard Cahn-Hilliard nucleation theory to the expansion of a bubble of the true ground

Fb(R) = 2πRσ − πR2∆F (∆F = F↓ − F↑),

(1)

where ∆F > 0 is the free energy gain in the bulk of the bubble. The surface tension σ which expresses the cost of
the wall is proportional to the exchange energy. When R exceeds the critical radius Rc = σ/∆F , the bubble expands
without limit (if dissipation is absent), happily paying the cost of the wall to gain bulk energy. Conversely, if R < Rc,
c = πσ2/∆F . For a purely classical
the bubble shrinks to zero. At the critical radius, Fb has the critical value Fb

(2)

where 1/τ0 is an attempt frequency. Clearly, if σ and ∆F are both T independent (which we argue is the case here
at all T < 0.5 K), the liftetime of the metastable state decreases exponentially with increasing T .

Trapping of the system in a metastable state can be represented as a particle located in a potential well U (M)
where M is a collective coordinate representing the local magnetization M(r) (see sketch in Fig. 4C, inset). After
the system is prepared with H (cid:107) −ˆz at temperature T ∼ 100 mK, it remains trapped for extremely long times if H
is tuned to a positive, but small, value 0 < H < Hs(T ) ((cid:39)0.122 T at 70 mK). As shown in Fig. 1B, the stability
for H =0 exceeds 8 hr at 10 mK. Incrementing H above Hs leads to a lowering of the barrier and a decrease in tE.
When H equals HJ (T ), we infer that tE(T ) falls inside the observation time window (1-3 min), so the ﬁrst jump is
observed. By measuring how HJ (T ) varies with T , we can deduce the eﬀect of T on the escape rate.

The curve of HJ (T ) (Fig. 4D) shows that HJ increases steeply with T . This trend is counter-intuitive if we view
the escape as a classical process.
In such “over the barrier” processes, raising T invariably speeds up the escape
event. Quite generally, in the Langer formulation [15], an escape occurs when a particular spin conﬁguration creates

5

a saddle point in the potential landscape U (M(r)) that breaches the barrier. As the probability for this to occur rises
exponentially with T , raising T should lead to a sharp reduction of tE (and hence a smaller HJ ). This is opposite to
the observed trend of HJ (T ). Contrary to the general expectation that “escape” should become easier, as more spin
conﬁgurations become accessible at higher T , we ﬁnd that escape is in fact more diﬃcult.

Next, we consider a hybrid classical-quantum process in which escape results from thermally-assisted tunneling.
Absorption of bosons (phonons or spin waves) from the bath brings the system’s energy closer to the top of the barrier
thereby enhancing the tunneling rate. Clearly, raising T increases the phonon or spin-wave population leading to an
enhanced escape rate, again in conﬂict with HJ (T ).

B. Dissipative quantum tunneling

One way to obtain an escape rate that increases with decreasing T is dissipative quantum tunneling.

In this

discussion, dissipation, as monitored by Rxx, plays an important role.

The quantum tunneling of a magnetization conﬁguration out of a metastable state is closely related to the decay
of the false vacuum investigated by Coleman and Callan [16, 17]. Via an instanton process (see Supplementary Sec.
S3), the system tunnels “under the barrier” to form a small bubble of the true ground state. Thereafter, the bubble
expands rapidly without limit (if dissipation is absent) in the classical Cahn-Hilliard process.

To incorporate dissipation, Caldeira and Leggett [18, 19] consider a single particle of mass m in the tilted double-
well potential U (q), and described by the classical equation of motion m¨q + η(ω) ˙q + ∂U/∂q = 0 (q is the collective
coordinate). Dissipation – introduced by a linear coupling to many classical oscillators – appears as the damping
coeﬃcient η(ω) which may depend on frequency ω. They ﬁnd that increasing the dissipation suppresses the tunneling
probability Γ. In eﬀect, each sampling (measurement) of the particle’s position by an oscillator collapses its wave
function; this resets the tunneling process. Whereas η by itself decreases Γ, raising T has the opposite eﬀect [20]. The
opposing eﬀects of dissipation and T have been investigated experimentally [21].

Within the optimal gating window in our experiment, Rxx is thermally activated with an energy gap ∆R. Hence
the dissipation increases faster than T (by a factor of 17 versus 4 between 50 mK and 200 mK). We reason as follows
that Γ should decrease, consistent with the observed trend in HJ .

At very low T , changes caused by increasing η compete with purely statistical changes caused by varying T .

Following Grabert et al. [20], the tunneling rate Γ(T, η) at low T may be expressed as
Γ0(η) ∼ exp(−B(η, 0)/),

Γ(T, η) = Γ0(η) exp(A(T, η)),

(3)

where B(η, 0) is the η-dependent exponent at T = 0. The T -dependent exponent is given by A(T, η) = f (η)T 2 (for
Ohmic dissipation).
Although the analytic expression for B(η, 0) is not known, numerical integration [42] shows that, at very large η,
B(η, 0) is asymptotically linear in η, but it approaches a constant as η → 0. Because they are additive and have
opposite signs, B(η, 0) and A(T, η) compete in the exponent of Γ(T, η). Unfortunately, theory provides only limited
guidance to their relative magnitudes. We reason that at low T and small η, A(T, η) is very small compared with
B(η, 0) (in fact Ref. [20] shows that A(T, η) vanishes exponentially like exp(−ω0/kBT ) in the limit η → 0, where ω0
is the characteristic frequency at the well minimum). Hence B(η, 0) dominates the exponent in Γ(T, η), i.e. Γ(T, η)
is an overall decreasing function of η, with negligible dependence on T (except insofar as raising T in our situation
causes η to increase exponentially). In eﬀect, as we raise T between T1 and T2, Γ decreases, consistent with the trend
in HJ (T ).

Tests of macroscopic quantum tunneling have been carried out in experiments involving Josephson junctions [21,

24, 25], molecular magnets [26–28], and domain wall dynamics [29–31].

A new feature in the present experiment is that both the jump magnitude ∆Ryx and its spatial correlation also
provide information on the rapid wall expansion that occurs after tunneling. Because dissipation diverts some of the
energy gain, a large dissipation will severely restrict the ﬁnal bubble size, overdamping the expansion [22, 23]. To us,
this provides a persuasive explanation of the behavior of ∆Ryx(T ) observed above 120 mK (Fig. 4C). The magnitude
∆Ryx provides a measure of the size of the spin-up regions after the expansion corresponding to the ﬁrst jump. In the
interval 80 mK < T <120 mK, the expansion of the true ground state extends to roughly half the sample. As T rises
above 120 mK, dissipation increasingly limits the expansion. Above T2, the ﬁnal radius (as measured by the jump
size) falls below resolution. Even if tunneling persists (as implied by the continued increase in HJ near T2), the ﬁnal
bubbles are far too small to be detected by Ryx. Raising T in this interval opens a dissipative channel that sharply
limits the size of the true ground state bubbles. (Because the activation gap protecting the quantized state is similar
in magnitude (∆R ∼ 190 mK, Sec. II D), we propose that the bulk electrons are the source of dissipation limiting the
wall expansion.)

6

Above T2, the smooth variations of Ryx vs. H (Fig. 3C) imply a gradual increase of the spin-up domains associated
with domain wall motion as in conventional magnets. At all T investigated, this smooth evolution is present as a
background process that exists in parallel with the jumps of interest.

At lower T , a major puzzle uncovered is the steady decrease of ∆Ryx to very small steps when T decreases below
70 mK to 10 mK for Vg = -80 V (Figs. 3B and 4C). The non-monotonic proﬁle of ∆Ryx vs. T implies that a second
process that suppresses the tunneling rate becomes increasingly important at very low T . We emphasize that this
suppression is conﬁned to the ultra-low dissipation state (the region -120< Vg < -80 V in Fig. 9). Once dissipation
is activated by gating, the jumps reappear at 10 mK. As shown in Fig. 3D, the curve at Vg = -90 V does not show
jumps whereas jumps reappear in the curves when Vg is changed to (-40, -10) V (all curves are at 10 mK).

It is instructive to view this pattern in the Vg-T plane (Fig. 9). The reappearance of the jumps for Vg > -40 V
implies that the boundary T1 decreases rapidly from 70 mK to <10 mK once Vg leaves the optimal gating window.
Hence a large gap ∆R (which strongly suppresses activation of bulk carriers) favors a large T1 while a small ∆R
decreases T1 to below 10 mK. The pattern implies that the absence of jumps below T1 is instrinsic to the ultralow
dissipation state.
The observation suggests the following (tentative) picture. Since zero dissipation leads to a steep increase in the
correlation length ξ of the spins in the limit T → 0, we reason that the tunneling rate Γ will again be suppressed if
Ns (the number of spins that tunnel coherently) increases to macroscopic values – e.g. the size of the whole sample.

In the WKB approximation, where Γ ∼ exp(−B/) with B = 2(cid:82)(cid:112)2mU (q) dq, with q a collective coordinate, a large

Ns or large mass m leads to strong suppression of Γ.

When µ lies within the minigap, the bulk electrons become negligible in the limit T → 0, so that ξ extends over
macroscopic regions and Γ becomes very small. Increasing the dissipation by changing Vg to (-40, -10) V serves to
reduce the size of the coherent region. Hence jumps can reappear at 10 mK. Although this argument is speculative,
the experiment potentially provides a way to measure ξ and its eﬀect on Γ in the limit T → 0.

C. Nucleation in Superﬂuid helium

Another known example in which the escape rate increases with decreasing T is the metastable A phase of superﬂuid
3He produced by supercooling below the AB transition. If 3He is cooled from the normal state to the superﬂuid state
at a ﬁnite pressure P (= 30 bar, say), it ﬁrst undergoes a second-order transition to the anisotropic A phase at the
critical temperature (Tc ∼2.3 mK). At a slightly lower T (∼2 mK), a ﬁrst-order transition to the isotropic B phase
occurs. Due to the ﬁrst-order nature of the AB transition, the A phase is metastable as a supercooled liquid until
∼ 0.7 Tc ∼ 1.4 mK when bubbles of the B phase expand to ﬁll the whole sample.
The Cahn-Hilliard theory (Eq. 1) predicts that, in 3D, Rc = 2σAB/∆F and F c

c∆F , where σAB is the
surface tension and FB the condensation energy of the B phase. Using known quantities, one calculates F c
b to be
extremely large (106 → 107 kBT at 0.7Tc). The predicted lifetime of the A phase τA ought to be many times the age
of the universe. The observed nucleation temperature posed a deep puzzle until Leggett proposed the theory (dubbed
“baked Alaska”) [32] that nucleation is triggered by cosmic rays. The strongly stochastic and often irreproducible
nature of the nucleation process made experimental tests diﬃcult. Subsequently, it was shown that τA is reduced
by factors of 10 − 100 if the superﬂuid is exposure to gamma rays from a 60Co source, in strong conﬁrmation of the
cosmic-ray theory [33]. Experimentally, τA(T ) is observed to decrease steeply with decreasing T with the empirical
form τ ∼ exp[a(Rc/R0)n] with n = 3 − 5 (a and R0 are ﬁt parameters).

b = (2π/3)R3

Despite the similarity of the lifetime trend vs. T , the 2 experiments are quite diﬀerent. In 3He, the extremely
large barrier F c
b precludes thermal activation as a relevant factor at 1 mK. The T dependence of τA arises because, in
the vicinity of the Tc curve, the critical divergence of σAB(T ) leads to a divergent increase in Rc (hence of F c
b ) as T
approaches Tc from below. The primary eﬀect of decreasing T is to strongly decrease the barrier height F c
b . Clearly,
this depends on being close to the second-order transition curve Tc (to have a strongly T dependent Rc). In addition,
we need an intervening ﬁrst-order (AB) transition for supercooling to occur.

In the QAH system, extensive measurements of Rij vs. both H and T (reported here and in Refs.

[6–10]) have
found no evidence for thermodynamic phase transitions (ﬁrst or second order) below 4 K (the critical temperature
for the ferromagnetic transition is in the range 15-30 K). The barrier height in the metastable state (which depends
on Hc and the exchange energy) is controlled by H, but is essentially T -independent below 0.5 K. Because the knob
(H) that changes the barrier height is independent of the knob that controls the dissipation (T ), we can infer that
the observed trend of HJ (T ) reﬂects the role of dissipation on the escape rate. Both reasons persuade us that the
3He supercooling theory is not applicable here.

D. Multiple paths and Network model

7

The pattern of correlation between Hall signals observed across pairs of Hall contacts separated by 100 µm (or
more) suggests that the jumps strongly perturb the magnetization pattern. As an illustration, we adopt a one-
wall model that allows R14,mn to be calculated for assumed positions of the wall using the B¨uttiker formalism (see
Supplementary Sec. S4). We calculate that the downstream Hall pair R14,53 undergoes a jump, but not the upstream
R14,62 (Supplementary Fig. S5). R14,23 jumps up while R14,65 jumps down, in agreement with Figs. 5C and D.
Next, we assume that the wall is further displaced to lie between the pair (6,2) and contact 1 at the second jump.
The calculated upstream Hall pair undergoes a jump, and the resistance pairs now reverse their jump directions
consistent with observation. However, the single-wall model is inadequate in many ways. Its biggest diﬃculty is that
the predicted jumps ∆Ryx are always 2 (in units of h/e2) whereas the observed magnitudes are roughly 1 or much
smaller. This ﬂaw appears to be intrinsic to the one-wall assumption.

We generalize to a multidomain picture in which tunneling starts from many seeds distributed across the sample. A
natural starting point is the closely related plateau transition in the conventional integer quantum Hall eﬀect (IQHE)
which has received considerable attention (see Supplementary Sec. S5) [34–36]. As H is varied, the chemical potential
µ crosses the center of a Landau level broadened by the disorder potential V (x). The current is diverted from the
dissipationless edge modes to a very small subset of extended but dissipative bulk states at the band center (states
away are Anderson localized). In the bulk, the centers of the cyclotron orbits describe chiral trajectories that track
the energy contours of V (x). Tunneling occurs between chiral trajectories that get close to each other (this leads to
scattering). Hence the transition of Ryx from one Hall plateau to the next occurs concurrently with the appearance
of dissipation (ﬁnite σxx).

The network model studied by Chalker and collaborators (Sec. S4) [34, 35] provides an elegant way to treat the
ﬂow of current through multiply connected paths. The sample is modeled as a regular lattice of corner sharing loops
deﬁned by directed links. At the shared corners (the nodes), incoming currents are scattered to one of the two outgoing
links with amplitudes parametrized by β (Eqs. S10 and S11 in Sec. S4). They ﬁnd that the localization length ξ(β)
diverges as |β − βc|ν with ν ∼2.5 where β = βc at maximal dissipation (where σxx peaks).
For the Chern transition in the QAH problem (Eq. S13 in Sec. S4), Wang, Liang and Zhang (WLZ) [37] have
established the existence of 3 types of domains with Chern number C = 0,±1. Identifying the Chern-number domain
walls with the energy contours in the IQHE problem, WLZ map the Chern transition to the network model of Chalker
et al., and obtain a divergence in ξ with the same exponent ν. WLZ infer that σij obeys the two-parameter scaling
relationship [38]. Evidence for this scaling in the QAH problem has been obtained by plotting σxx vs. σxy in the
vicinity of the Chern-number transition [7, 8]. Evidence for the ν = 0 QAH state has also been reported by Yoshimi
et al. [39].
We discuss our results in the context of the foregoing. Just before the ﬁrst jump in Ryx occurs, the sample is
predominantly in the C = −1 state (because Rxx is ﬁnite and very small, there exist small regions with C = 0).
After the ﬁrst jump, which involves – by assumption – expansion from multiple seeds spread over the sample, the
C = 0 regions deﬁne a multiply connected network of conducting paths. The observation that ∆Ryx is close to 1 (but
never 2) suggests to us that the converted regions have C = 0 (this provides support for the 3-domain proposition of
WLZ [37]). In this network, connectivity between the chiral modes is mediated by tunneling at the nodes as in the
network model (the microscopic tunneling between chiral modes occurring at the nodes is to be distinguished from
the macroscopic quantum tunneling that triggers the jumps). The bulk conduction is dominated by a few backbone
paths (as in percolation networks) that extend across the sample width to give ∆Ryx ∼ 1. We expect the sudden
appearance of a network of regions with C = 0 to strongly perturb the system away from the two-parameter scaling
behavior. This is borne out in an interesting way.

In Fig. 9B, we show plots of σxx vs. σxy at selected T for Vg ﬁxed at -80 V (within the optimal gating window).
Above T2 (curves at 142 and 152 mK), the measured σij trace out a nearly ideal semicircle (the dome). Within the
interval (T1, T2) the ﬁrst jump and subsequent ones kick the orbit high above the dome – the orbit returns only when
the transition is nearly complete (σxy → e2/h). A notable pattern is that the perturbed orbits extend above the dome
(the exception is a small sliver inside the dome for pre-jump segments at T < 100 mK). This rich pattern suggests
that the two-parameter scaling behavior is valid above T2, but the jumps take the system high above the scaling
dome.

Although two-parameter scaling cannot be employed to obtain σxy when jumps occur, it seems possible to calculate
numerically σxy and σxx from large networks as carried out for ξ in Refs. [34, 35]. Calculations clarifying the conditions
under which ∆Ryx is smaller than 1 will add valuable insight into what happens at the jumps.

8

E. Outlook and Conclusions

The key features uncovered are the large jumps in the Hall resistance of magnitude ∆Ryx ∼ h/e2 and in Rxx when
the QAH system is trapped in the metastable state with C = −1, within the interval T1 < T < T2. A key ﬁnding
is that the escape rate is sharply decreased as T increases. From the thermal activation of Rxx, we have inferred
that the increase in dissipation overwhelms any purely thermal eﬀect associated with increasing T ; the increased
dissipation then suppresses the tunneling probability Γ. Hence the Caldeira-Leggett theory seems to be the most
appealing explanation for the jumps.

Because the transitions involve tunneling of a ﬁeld φ(x, t) with many degrees of freedom (as opposed to one collective
degree of freedom), the present experiment uncovers additional features that invite further investigation. The most
interesting seems to be the existence of a temperature scale T1 below which jumps are not observed within the
experimental timescale, which we tentatively identify with another eﬀect of dissipation. As shown in Fig. 9 the
ultralow dissipation state is protected by a small energy gap ∆R from thermal excitation of bulk electrons. The latter
opens up a dissipative channel that strongly aﬀects the tunneling process. Above T2, the dissipation strongly limits
the expansion of the bubble after tunneling occurs.

In a recent scanning nano-SQUID investigation of the magnetization reversal in a sample closely similar to ours, the
existence of very small (several 10 nm) spin-up regions was directly observed at T down to 300 mK [40]. Strikingly,
these small regions are static and hence incompatible with conventional domain wall motion. We suggest that the
static spin-up regions are bubbles whose post-tunneling expansion has been halted by overdamping (at 300 mK,
they are too small to be resolved in Ryx). Extending the SQUID experiments to below 100 mK (where ∆Ryx ∼ 1)
will allow a direct comparison with the transport results. We expect that the static size of the spin-up regions will
increase rapidly to macroscopic lengths (100 µm) as T is lowered from T2 to 100 mK. A related experiment revealing
the coincidence of superparamagnetism and perfect quantization in the QAH problem was recently reported [41].
Investigation of the correlations between jumps can be feasibly extended to a large number (∼20) of contacts to

provide a more detailed map of the spatial displacement of the wall.

The role of dissipation in macroscopic quantum tunneling (for e.g.

in determining Ns) remains a challenge both
for theory and experiment. The quantum anomalous Hall system, in which the chemical potential, dissipation,
ﬁeld strength and temperature can be varied independently, provides a powerful system to explore these issues
quantitatively.

IV. MATERIALS AND METHODS

Samples were grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) using thermally heated single elemental (at least 5N purity)
sources. The SrTiO3 substrates were annealed in an oxygen environment between 925 C to 965 C for about 2.5 hours
and were checked after annealing with atomic force microscopy for an atomically ordered surface with an RMS
roughness of <0.3 nm before growth. Substrates were indium mounted on the MBE sample holder and outgassed at
500 C for an hour in the MBE chamber before growth. Cr doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 was grown at
240 C as measured
by a pryometer with a growth rate of about 0.5 QL/min. After growth, the sample was allowed to cool to room
temperature and was capped with about 3 nm of Al. The sample was then exposed to atmosphere to allow the Al
capping layer to oxidize, forming Al2O3. Finally, the sample was heated in an argon environment to melt the indium
in order to free the sample from its substrate. The remaining indium on the back of the substrate is then used for
the back gate contact. For further details, see Kandala et al. [11]

In the experiment, the Hall bar (width 0.5 mm and length 1 mm) was made by scratching the thin ﬁlm with
a sharp needle controlled by programmable stepper motors. The Ohmic contact is made by ﬁrmly pressing tiny
pieces of Indium onto the contact pads. The pressing action is believed to help the Indium penetrate through the
Al2O3 capping layer and form a good contact with the underlying Cr doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 layer. The measurements
were performed with the sample immersed in the 3He-4He mixture of a top-loading wet dilution refrigerator (Oxford
Instruments TLM400). To ﬁlter out room-temperature radiation, three ﬁlter stages were added to the circuit. At the
room-temperature end, an LC π ﬁlter provided over 80 dB attenuation above 100 MHz. Two cryogenic ﬁlters were
installed in the mixing chamber. One was a powder ﬁlter that ﬁlters out radiation above 1 GHz while the second was
an RC ﬁlter with a cutoﬀ frequency of 300 KHz. The overall time constant of the whole circuit was ∼10 ms. Nearly
all the results reported were taken using a Keithley 6221 precision current source and a Keithley 2182 nanovoltmeter
operating in delta mode (with overall time constant of ∼1 s). The relative accuracy of the resistance measurements
was conﬁrmed to be better than 0.1% using a 100 ppm precision resistor. The exceptions (Figs. 2D, 4, 5 and 6 of
the main text) were performed using a Stanford Research SR830 lock-in ampliﬁer at frequency 2 Hz, with the signal
pre-ampliﬁed by a Stanford Research SR560 and/or PAR113 preampliﬁers (time constant set at 2 s in Figs. 4, 5 and
6, and 5 s in Fig. 2D). The excitation current was 1 nA in both methods.

For the high-speed measurements of the jump duration (Fig. 7), we applied a DC current of 2.5 nA. The room-
temperature ﬁlter was removed. The voltage signal was ampliﬁed by the SR560 preampliﬁer and then digitized by a
Zurich Instrument HF2 lock-in ampliﬁer at a sampling rate of 6.4 KS/s (S= sampling). For these measurements the
ﬁeld-sweep rate was reduced to 0.1 mT/min.

FIG. 1: Quantization of the Hall resistance in a 10 nm-thick ﬁlm of Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 at mK temperatures. Panel (A)
shows the Hall plateaus in the Hall resistance Ryx at 10 mK (blue curves). The transition between Chern states at the coercive
ﬁeld Hc (∼ 0.14 T) is nearly vertical. The longitudinal resistance Rxx (red curves) displays ultralow dissipation, apart from
the sharp peaks at Hc. Panel (B) tests the stability of the Chern state Ryx = h/e2 over an extended period (8-9 hrs), with H
ﬁxed at zero starting at time indicated by vertical arrows. The two traces at 49 mK (grey trace) and 72 mK (green) are shown
displaced for clarity. In Panel (C), the expanded scale shows that Ryx deviates from h/e2 by a few parts in 104 in the optimal
gating window −110 < Vg < −90. In Panel (D), the expanded scale shows that Rxx drops to < 3 × 10−4h/e2 near H = 0. The
sharp spike at H = 0 reﬂects quenching of superconductivity in the In solder used in the contacts. Rxx is thermally activated
with a gap ∆R ∼ 190 mK.

FIG. 3: Jumps in Ryx at the transition between Chern states. Panel (A) shows traces of Ryx at selected T (10→70 mK) as H
is slowly swept (10 mT/min) past Hc as indicated by the arrows. The transition between Chern states C = ±1 is nominally
smooth below 40 mK. Starting near T1 ∼ 65 mK, small vertical jumps appear near the start of the transition. Panel (B) shows
Ryx vs. H in the important interval 70 mK ≤ T ≤ 145 mK in which large jumps are clustered. Starting at 83 mK, the system
“escapes” the C = −1 state by a very large initial jump, followed by a cascade of smaller ones. Focussing on the initial jump,
we see that ﬁeld HJ (T ) that triggers the jump (kink feature) increases steadily as T rises to 142 mK. Above 131 mK, the jump
magnitude ∆Ryx sharply decreases becoming unresolved above T2 ∼ 145 mK. Panel (C) shows that, from T2 to 580 mK, Ryx
changes smoothly over the (now broadened) transition. Panel (D) shows how the Ryx curves change with Vg at 10 mK. At
optimal gating (Vg = -90 V), the transition is smooth, but as Vg is increased to -10 V, the jumps re-appear, implying that a
small amount of dissipation is necessary to seed the jump at the lowest T . The experimental time constants are 1s in all panels
except D where it is 5 s (see Supplement).

FIG. 4: Proﬁles of resistance Rxx vs. H at selected T as H is slowly swept at 1 mT/min (arrows). Below 50 mK (Panel (A)),
the proﬁle is nominally smooth and asymmetric, whereas small vertical jumps appear near the leading edge as T rises above
T1. In the interval 83→ 216 mK (Panel (B)), the smooth proﬁle is dissected by large jumps ∆Rxx that are positive (upwards)
near the leading edge and negative near the trailing edge. Above T2, the proﬁle is again smooth but twice as broad as at 10
mK. In Panel (C), we plot the distribution of the initial jump magnitude ∆Ryx vs T within the optimal gating window. Above
T1, ∆Ryx initially rises to a value ∼ h/e2, then falls steeply to zero at T2. Jumps are not resolved above T2. The inset is a
sketch of the system (red circle) trapped in a potential U (M ). Panel (D) plots the escape ﬁeld HJ (T ) of the initial jump vs.
T (solid symbols) inferred from Ryx and Rxx from both sweep-up and -down runs. Below T1, HJ (T ) terminates at the curve
of Hs(T ) (the onset ﬁeld for small, precursor steps plotted as open triangles), which shares the same slope as the coercive ﬁeld
Hc(T ) (open circles). Hc is deﬁned by the maximum in Rxx (when the curve is smooth). Hc is undeﬁned between 100 mK and
T2, but it smoothly extends to measurements above T2.

FIG. 5: The jumps in Ryx (top panels) and Rxx (bottom) detected by simultaneous measurements of R14,mn, as labelled [I
applied to contacts (1, 4) and voltage measured across (m, n)]. The ﬁeld sweep rate is 1 T/min. At both 105 and 120 mK
(Panels (A) and (B)), the initial jump strongly aﬀects the downstream Hall signal (R14,53), but barely changes the upstream
pair (R14,62). At the second jump, however, the upstream pair is strongly perturbed. The inset in Panel (A) shows the contacts,
and the wall separating Chern state C = −1 (green) from +1 (yellow) after the ﬁrst jump occurs. In the resistance (bottom
row), the ﬁrst jump increases R14,23 but decreases R14,65 at both 105 and 120 mK (Panels (C) and (D)). The signs in both
pairs become reversed at the second jump, also consistent with the upstream motion of the wall.

FIG. 6: Four traces of the resistances R14,mn measured in succession at 86 mK with Vg = -80 V. For each trace, the sample
is prepared in the C = -1 state and the transition is induced by sweeping H slowly through Hc at the rate 1 mT/min while
monitoring the resistances R14,mn. Panel (A) shows the upstream Hall resistance R14,26 (light curves) and downstream Hall
R14,53 (bold). Panel (B) plots the corresponding longitudinal left-contact resistance R14,65 (bold curves) and right-contact
resistance R14,23 (light). Although the jumps are stochastic, the overall pattern for the ﬁrst two jumps is fairly reproducible
from one run to the next.

FIG. 7: Time trace of a jump event observed in Rxx measured with the room-temperature ﬁlters in the circuit removed (but
not the low-temperature ﬁlters) at T = 117 mK and Vg = -85 V. The jump occurs on a time scale ∆t that is shorter than 1
ms, the time constant of the remaining ﬁlter. The ﬁeld sweep rate was 0.1 mT/min.

FIG. 8: Semilog plot of Ryx and Rxx as a function of Vg (Panel (A)), with T ﬁxed at 10 mK and H ﬁxed at either 0 (solid
triangles) or at 1 T (solid circles). As |Vg| decreases, the exponential increase in Rxx (blue and black symbols) implies that
µ is being raised above the mini-gap ∆R. Comparison between Rxx at H = 0 (blue) and 1 T (black) shows that a ﬁnite H
decreases ∆R. Similarly, the curves for Ryx (red and magenta) show an exponential deviation from the quantum value h/e2 as
|Vg| is decreased. The Hall curves persist longer at the quantized value than the resistance curves. The semilog plot of σxx vs.
1/T with Vg = -80 V (Panel (B)) reveals an activated conductivity at both H = 0.5 T and 33 mT. The straight-line ﬁts yield
values of ∆R ∼ 190 mK (at H (cid:39) 0) and 155 mK (0.5 T).

FIG. 9: Crossover boundaries in the (Vg, T ) plane (Panel A) and scaling plot of σxx vs. σxy (B). In Panel A, the optimal
gating window lies left of the vertical dashed line (-120 < Vg < -80 V). The resistance gap ∆R, which protects the ultralow
dissipation state, equals (cid:39) 190 mK within this window but falls rapidly outside the window. In the shaded region above ∆R, the
system is dissipative (darker shade indicates larger Rxx). Jumps in Rxx and Ryx are observed between the two characteristic
temperatures T1 and T2. The curve of T1 decreases steeply outside the window. In the ultralow dissipation region below T1
(ULD), jumps are not observed on our experimental timescales. In Panel B, the scaling plot describes a nearly ideal semicircle
above T2 (curves at 142 and 152 mK). Within the interval (T1, T2), the appearance of jumps kicks the orbits high above the
semicircle. This implies violation of the two-parameter scaling behavior [38].
