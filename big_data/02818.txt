ABSTRACT
We present new estimates of AGN accretion and star-formation luminosity in galaxies
obtained for the local 12 µm sample of Seyfert galaxies (12MGS), by performing a
detailed broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition including the
emission of stars, dust heated by star formation and a possible AGN dusty torus.
Thanks to the availability of data from the X-rays to the sub-millimetre, we constrain
and test the contribution of the stellar, AGN and star-formation components to the
SEDs. The availability of Spitzer-IRS low resolution mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectra is
crucial to constrain the dusty torus component at its peak wavelengths. The results
of SED-ﬁtting are also tested against the available information in other bands: the
reconstructed AGN bolometric luminosity is compared to those derived from X-rays
and from the high excitation IR lines tracing AGN activity like [Ne V] and [O IV]. The
IR luminosity due to star-formation (SF) and the intrinsic AGN bolometric luminosity
are shown to be strongly related to the IR line luminosity. Variations of these relations
with diﬀerent AGN fractions are investigated, showing that the relation dispersions
are mainly due to diﬀerent AGN relative contribution within the galaxy. Extrapolating
these local relations between line and SF or AGN luminosities to higher redshifts, by
means of recent Herschel galaxy evolution results, we then obtain mid- and far-IR
line luminosity functions useful to estimate how many star-forming galaxies and AGN
we expect to detect in the diﬀerent lines at diﬀerent redshifts and luminosities with
future IR facilities (e.g., JWST, SPICA).

Key words: galaxies: active – galaxies: evolution – galaxies: luminosity function –
galaxies: Seyfert – infrared: galaxies.

1 INTRODUCTION

The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole
accretion follow a similar rise and fall, oﬀering evidence
for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies (i.e.,

Shankar et al. 2009; Kormendy & Ho 2013 and references
therein). The data show that the star formation activity
peaked at around 8–11 Gyr ago (at redshifts between 1 and
3; e.g. Burgarella et al. 2013). In this phase most of the en-
ergy emitted in the star formation process was absorbed by
dust and converted into infrared (IR), with less than 10%
remaining visible at ultraviolet (UV) to optical wavelengths

(e.g., Madau & Dickinson 2014). While the large majority
of present-day stars have been produced in such obscured
galaxies, we have very limited knowledge about the nature
of infrared galaxies at those high redshifts, on what con-
trolled and changed the star formation along the evolution
of these galaxies and of their metal content at early epochs.
Dusty galaxies are the only ones that can tell us the whole
story of galaxy and AGN evolution (whose activity peaks at
about the same epoch) during that obscured era. So far, mid-
and far-IR facilities like ISO, Spitzer and - more recently -
Herschel have allowed us to observe the “obscured” side of
the Universe at non local redshifts mostly in photometry, by
measuring total ﬂuxes of galaxies, but not peering into their
internal physics. This could be done through mid- and far-
IR spectroscopic observations, only for local galaxies or, at
high redshifts, for few lensed and/or ultra-luminous sources
not representative of the bulk of the galaxy population.

Emission-line intensities and emission-line ratios in the
mid- and far-IR domain, not suﬀering from dust extinction
as the optical and UV emission lines, provide unique infor-
mation on the physical conditions (i.e., electron density and
temperature, degree of ionisation and excitation, chemical
composition) of the gas responsible for emitting the lines
within the dust-obscured regions of galaxies with intense
star formation activity or surrounding an AGN (Spinoglio
& Malkan 1992; Rubin et al. 1994; Panuzzo et al. 2003). The
typical electron density of the emitting gas can be identiﬁed
through IR ﬁne structure lines, since diﬀerent IR ﬁne struc-
ture transitions of the same ion have diﬀerent critical density
to collisional de-excitation (e.g., [O III] at 52 and 88 µm).
Moreover, the relative strengths of the ﬁne-structure lines in
diﬀerent ionisation stages can probe the primary spectrum of
the ionising source, with these line ratios providing informa-
tion on the age of the ionising stellar population and on the
ionisation parameter in single H II regions or in starbursts
of short duration. In addition, these line ratios are sensitive
to the presence of non-stellar sources of ionising photons,
like the AGN, with some of these lines with higher ionisa-
tion potential ([Ne V] at 14.32 and 24.32 µm, and [O IV] at
25.89 µm) excited only – or primarily – by an AGN (Genzel
et al. 1998; Armus et al. 2007).

In the analysis performed in this work, we have consid-
ered the two PAH features at 6.2 and 11.25 µm and several
mid- and far-IR ﬁne-structure lines, including four emission
lines from photodissociation regions, PDRs ([Si II] 34.8µm,
[O I] 63µm, [O I] 145.5µm and [C II] 157.7µm), seven stel-
lar/H II region lines ([Ne II] 12.8µm, [S III] 18.7µm, [S III]
33.5µm, [O III] 51.8µm, [N III] 57.3µm, [O III] 88µm and
[N II] 122µm) and four AGN lines ([Ne V] at 14.3 and
24.3µm, [Ne III] 15.5µm and [O IV] 25.9µm).

In Spinoglio et al. (2012) “global” relations between the
luminosity of the above lines and the total IR luminosity
were derived for all the sources of the 12-µm selected sample
of Seyfert galaxies (12MGS; Rush et al. 1993), regardless
the AGN type and the fraction of AGN contributing to the
IR luminosity, while in Bonato et al. (2014b) an attempt
was made to correlate the line luminosity with the SF IR
luminosity and the AGN bolometric luminosity, although
the latter was derived using just a few representative SED
templates, normalised to the observed 12µm ﬂux density.

What is new in our approach with respect to the previ-
ous works is that we use the broad-band photometry, from

UV to millimeter (mm), to constrain the stellar and SF com-
ponents, and the Spitzer–IRS spectra to constrain the torus.
Moreover, we derive new relations between the line and
the total IR/AGN accretion luminosities by accounting for
the diﬀerent AGN contributions, ﬁnding diﬀerent relations
for AGN dominated sources with respect to star-formation
dominated ones.

The total IR, SF and AGN bolometric luminosities have
been derived by performing a detailed 3-components (emis-
sion from stars, dust heated by star formation and a pos-
sible AGN dusty torus) spectral energy distribution (SED)
decomposition (Berta et al. 2013) of the well studied and
extensively observed 12MGS local sample. We note that,
thanks to the very detailed data (IR spectrum and photom-
etry along the whole SED), available for this local sample, we
are able to constrain the crucial physical quantities charac-
terising the AGN and its host galaxy like, i.e., star-formation
rate (SFR), AGN luminosity, stellar mass, AGN fraction. On
the contrary, similar works performed on higher-z samples
cannot reach the same kind of precision on the physical pa-
rameter derivation, because the constraints are not as many,
as good and as detailed as here.

The resulting SF and the reconstructed AGN bolomet-
ric luminosities are then related to the available mid- and
far-IR line luminosities and used to derive new estimates of
the relationships between the luminosity of PAH features
and ﬁne structure lines and AGN bolometric or SF luminos-
ity. Variations of these relations with diﬀerent AGN fractions
are investigated. By extrapolating these local line vs. AGN
(or SF) luminosity relations to higher redshifts, by means
of recent Herschel galaxy evolution results (e.g., Gruppioni
et al. 2013), we then obtain mid- and far-IR line luminosity
functions (LFs). Thanks to the line LFs we can then esti-
mate how many SF galaxies and AGNs we expect to detect
in the diﬀerent IR lines at diﬀerent redshifts with future IR
facilities, like, e.g., the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST;
Gardner et al. 2006) and the SPace IR telescope for Cosmol-
ogy and Astrophysics (SPICA; Nakagawa et al. 2012).

The paper is organised as follows. We present the
12MGS Seyfert sample in Section 2. In Sections 3 and 4
we present the SED decomposition method and discuss the
main results obtained. In Sections 5 and 6 we derive the
AGN/SB diagnostics and the relations between the line and
the SF or accretion luminosity. In Section 7 we derive the
line luminosity functions up to high redshifts and the esti-
mates for future IR facilities. Finally, in Section 8 we present
our conclusions.
Throughout this paper, we use a Chabrier (2003) initial
mass function (IMF) and we adopt a ΛCDM cosmology with
H0 = 71 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.27, and ΩΛ = 0.73.

2 THE SAMPLE

The parent reference sample in our work is the extended 12-
µm galaxy sample (12MGS) selected by Rush et al. (1993)
(hereafter RMS) from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite
(IRAS) Faint Source Catalogue Version-2 (FSC-2). The orig-
inal RMS sample consists of 893 galaxies with IRAS 12-µm
ﬂux >0.22 Jy, 118 of which were preliminary classiﬁed as
AGN (51 Seyfert 1s or quasars, 63 Seyfert 2s and 2 blazars)
from existing catalogues of active galaxies (Spinoglio &

MNRAS 000, 1–24 (2015)

Malkan 1989; Veron-Cetty & Veron 1991; Hewitt & Bur-
bidge 1991). Although the selection of active galaxies based
on their rest-frame mid-IR ﬂux is commonly considered one
of the best tools to provide almost unbiased AGN samples
(e.g., Spinoglio & Malkan 1989 argue that since all galax-
ies emit a similar fraction of their bolometric luminosity at
12 µm, the AGN selection based on their rest-frame 12-µm
ﬂux is almost unbiased), a small anisotropy has been noted
by some authors through the comparison with radio (e.g.,
Buchanan et al. 2006; H¨onig et al. 2011) or X-ray (e.g.,
Gandhi et al. 2009; Asmus et al. 2014) selected samples.
With this cautiousness in mind, we can nonetheless consider
the 118 mid-IR selected, optically classiﬁed AGN to consti-
tute one of the largest IR-selected almost unbiased/mildly
biased samples of AGN, likely to be almost representative
of the true number and fractions of diﬀerent active galaxy
types in relation to each other, and thus well suited for pop-
ulation statistics. In support to our assumption, we note
that, some authors (e.g., Gandhi et al. (2009) and Asmus
et al. (2014) among many others) deﬁne the 12-µm ﬂux as
a good indicator of the intrinsic AGN continuum emission.
The 12MGS sample of AGN beneﬁts from an extensive an-
cillary dataset, including photometry and spectroscopy from
the X-rays to radio frequencies, coming from diﬀerent ob-
servational campaigns spread over the past 20 years. In the
next sub-sections we will present the multi-wavelength data
available for the 12MGS Seyfert sample, focusing on those
used in our analysis.

2.1 Spectroscopic data

As mentioned above, the original AGN classiﬁcation was
based on optical data. Redshifts and optical spectroscopic
data from the literature can be found in the IPAC-NED
public Database. Using data from the literature, Brightman
& Nandra (2011b) re-classiﬁed the 116 (excluding the two
blazars) 12MGS AGN into Seyfert 1s, intermediate Seyfert
1.2-1.9s, Seyfert 2s and H II/LINERs, based on optical line
ratio diagnostics, X-ray, 12 µm and [O III] luminosities and
X-ray spectral properties.

Tommasin et al. (2008, 2010) presented Spitzer-IRS
high-resolution spectra between 10 and 37 µm for 91 of the
118 AGN of the 12MGS (some of which changed their clas-
siﬁcation based on these spectroscopic data; see Tommasin
et al. 2010 for details), while Wu et al. (2009) obtained
low resolution IRS spectra in the 5.5–35 µm range for 103
Seyferts of the 12MGS.

To obtain a homogeneous IRS spectroscopy data set
we re-reduced the IRS data. First, we searched for low-
resolution IRS spectroscopy of 12MGS objects in the Spitzer
data archive. We found 81 and 49 mapping and staring IRS
observations, respectively. To reduce the data, we used the
standard pipeline (version C18.18). In addition to the stan-
dard reduction, we subtracted the background emission and
removed rogue pixels using IRSCLEAN with the appropri-
ate rogue mask for each observation. For the staring ob-
servations, the spectra were extracted assuming point-like
emission. For the mapping observations, we created a data
cube by projecting the single pointings into a grid in a man-
ner similar to CUBISM (Smith et al. 2007a). The spectra
were extracted from the data cubes using 7.7 arcsec×7.7
arcsec and 17.8 arcsec×17.8 arcsec square apertures in the

short-low (SL; 5.2-14 µm) and long-low (LL; 14-36 µm)
cubes, respectively, centered on the nuclei. We applied an
aperture correction based on the IRS mapping observations
of the stars HR7341 (AOR 16295168) and HR6606 (AOR
16463104). We did this to obtain comparable spectra from
both the mapping and the staring data.

In some cases, we found a mismatch in the continuum
level between the SL (slit width of 3.6 arcsec) and the LL
(slit width of 10.5 arcsec) spectral ranges. This can be pro-
duced by two reasons: the LL slit (or aperture) includes no-
ticeable extended emission; or the slits were not well centred
on the nucleus. Since we are interested on the IRS spectra
to constrain the AGN torus, we excluded from our analysis
all the spectra with a mismatch larger than 20% in the con-
tinuum level at 14 µm, which may indicate that there is ex-
tended emission in the LL spectra. In total, we obtained the
IRS spectra of 76 point-like sources, 56 of them with map-
ping observations and the rest with staring observations.

For 26 Seyfert galaxies (out of the selected 76) also
the far-IR ﬁne-structure lines have been observed with the
Herschel–PACS and –SPIRE spectrometers, and presented
by Spinoglio et al. (2015); Pereira-Santaella et al. (2013) and
Fern´andez-Ontiveros et al. (in preparation).

Our ﬁnal sample used for this study consists of 76 AGN:
42 Seyfert 1 (including 4 quasars), 27 Seyfert 2 and 7 non-
Seyfert galaxies (6 H II and 1 LINER). In Tables 1 and 2 we
present the ﬂuxes of the mid-IR (from Tommasin et al. 2008,
2010) and far-IR lines (from Spinoglio et al. 2015; Pereira-
Santaella et al. 2013, Fern´andez Ontiveros et al. in prepara-
tion) considered in this work.

2.2 X-ray data

Rush et al. (1996) studied the soft X-ray spectra of the
12MGS from ROSAT All-Sky Survey observations, while
Barcons et al. (1995) used hard X-ray data from HEAO 1.
Brightman & Nandra (2011a) analysed the XMM-Newton
spectra (2–10 keV) of 126 galaxies of this sample, estimat-
ing their intrinsic power, continuum shape and obscuration
levels. In a subsequent paper, Brightman & Nandra (2011b)
redetermined the activity class of the 12MGS sources by way
of optical line ratio diagnostics and characterised the opti-
cal class by their X-ray, 12-µm and [O III] luminosities and
X-ray spectral properties. The X-ray classiﬁcation has been
taken into account, together with the classiﬁcation based on
optical and mid-IR spectra, to constrain the torus model
when ﬁtting the SED, as described in Section 3.

The 12MGS sources of our subsample have been ob-
served in X-rays with diﬀerent instruments,
in diﬀerent
bands, during diﬀerent campaigns. For the purpose of our
work, we have considered the XMM data in the 2-10 keV
range as taken from the IPAC-NED1 public Database, which
provides also the X-ray luminosity.

2.3 Photometric catalogue

To construct the broad-band SEDs of our subsample of the
12MGS, we have searched in the literature (in the IPAC-

NED, Simbad2 and Vizier3 public Databases) for all the
available data, from UV to mm. The public data were mostly
patchy and derived from diﬀerent observational campaigns
with diﬀerent instruments and photometries. When more
than one observation was available for the same object in
the same band, we have chosen the more recent and/or the
one giving the ”total ﬂux” (e.g. corrected for aperture).
In order to maximise the data coverage in the mid-IR range,

crucial for constraining and disentangling the AGN compo-
nent, we have re-binned the IRS spectral data in 2-µm in-
tervals and added those data to the photometric SED data.
Thanks to the IRS data, we were able to characterise the
dusty torus model and constrain its parameters, e.g., by
considering high optical depths for sources showing a strong
9.7-µm absorption feature in their spectra (see next Section
for details).
In Tables A1, A2 of Appendix A we present the photometric
data for the 76 12MGS galaxies considered in this work. We
stress that the sample is not a complete sample for statisti-
cal purpose. However, since it was randomly selected from

MNRAS 000, 1–24 (2015)

a nearly complete sample, it maintains a robust statistical
signiﬁcance. Therefore, it can be considered as a representa-
tive sample of local the Seyfert galaxy population, for which
data are available in virtually all wave-bands, from UV to
mm, to deﬁne their SED, including Spitzer-IRS spectrum
(in the mid-IR range) to constrain the torus component.

Figure 1 shows the distributions of the 12-µm ﬂux,
redshift and 12-µm luminosity for our 76 Seyfert galaxies,
compared to those of the entire 12MGS optically classiﬁed
AGN sample. We conﬁrm that the objects in our study
are representative of the range of properties of the 12MGS
AGN: in fact, a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test
gives P=0.93 (D=0.079), P=0.67 (D=0.10) and P=0.87
(D=0.082) for the 12-µm ﬂux, the redshift and the 12-µm
luminosity respectively.

3 BROAD-BAND SED DECOMPOSITION

The rest-frame SEDs of the galaxies in the sample have been
ﬁtted with a three components model using the approach
described by Berta et al. (2013). The adopted code was in-
spired by MAGPHYS (da Cunha et al. 2008) for the stellar
and dusty star formation part, but it eﬀectively combines
three components simultaneously, i.e. including AGN/torus
emission. Due to the huge number of possible combinations,
the code samples the parameters space randomly, allowing
for roughly 109 possible combinations at each iteration. We
defer to Berta et al. (2013) for further details about the code.
The adopted libraries are the Bruzual & Charlot (2003)
stellar library (see also da Cunha et al. 2008), the da Cunha
et al. (2008) IR dust-emission library and the library of
AGN tori by Fritz et al. (2006), updated by Feltre et al.
(2012). The latter includes both the emission of the dusty
torus, heated by the central AGN engine, and the emission
of the accretion disk. Note that the considered AGN models
are based on a continuous (e.g., “smooth”) distribution of
dust across the torus; we have not tested the technique with
clumpy torus models. For a direct comparison smooth vs.
clumpy torus see Feltre et al. (2012).

The AGN library comprises a total of 2376 models,
each “observed” from 10 diﬀerent viewing angles spanning
the 0-90 degrees range with respect to the torus equatorial
plane. The geometry of the torus varies as parametrised by
its opening angle of the torus, Θ, and the ratio between
the outer and inner radius of the dust distribution, Rm.
The dust density distribution is parametrised as ρ(r, θ) =
Arβexp(−γcos(θ)), as a function of the vertical (θ) and ra-
dial (r) coordinates, with exponents γ and β. If (γ, β)=(0,0),
there is no variation of the dust density in either the ver-
tical or radial direction. Finally τ9,7 is the reference optical
depth of the torus on the equatorial plane, computed at 9.7
µm and integrated over the whole extent of the torus.

Due to degeneracies between the parameters (see Hatz-
iminaoglou et al. 2009; Pozzi et al. 2010), we limit the anal-
ysis to γ = 0.0 and β = −1.0, −0.5, 0.0. Moreover, we
constrain Rm (cid:54) 100 (Netzer et al. 2007; Mullaney et al.
2011), in order to avoid too large and cold tori.

The wealth of information available for the 12MGS sam-
ple can be used to further constrain the torus library and
properties, so to reduce degeneracies. More speciﬁcally, the
X-ray spectra allow an estimate of the column density NH .

In parallel, the presence or absence of the 9.7 µm Silicate
feature in absorption in the mid-IR spectra provides hints
on the most reasonable τ9.7 range to be used. Finally opti-
cal and X-ray classiﬁcations, as well as optical/mid-IR SED
shapes can put constraints on the most convenient viewing
angles to be used. Hence we combine these three pieces of
information to further reduce the number of models, and in-
clude/avoid those with strong absorption or improper view-
ing angles in the ﬁt, for each speciﬁc case. In particular, we
use the information about NH from X-rays and the pres-
ence/absence of the 9.7 µm feature to reduce the number of
possible torus solutions for each source, e.g., by excluding
all the torus models with no 9.7 µm feature in absorption
for objects with high NH and/or with that feature observed
in the IRS spectrum. Viceversa, we have excluded the “ob-
scured”/“optically thick” models for objects with low col-
umn density and/or no 9.7 µm feature in absorption in the
IRS spectrum. Analogously, we have used the information
from optical spectroscopy (e.g. Seyfert 1 or 2 based on broad
or narrow lines and BPT diagrams; Baldwin et al. 1981): in
case of objects spectroscopically classiﬁed as type 1/“broad-
line”, we have considered only “unobscured” torus models,
with the optical/UV spectrum provided by the AGN/disk
and not by the stellar component. Viceversa, for objects
classiﬁed as type 2, we have considered only models with
depressed/absorbed optical/UV light, letting it to be repro-
duced by the host galaxy stellar contribution.
In this way the random sampling of the torus library avoids
to waste computing time on models that will be in any case
discarded, and focuses on a ﬁner sampling of the appropriate
torus parameters range.

Note that the chosen torus library can in principle be
changed and selected among all the sets available in the lit-
erature, either “smooth” (e.g., Pier & Krolik 1992, Granato
& Danese 1994, Fritz et al. 2006), “clumpy” (e.g., Nenkova
et al. 2008, H¨onig & Kishimoto 2010) or “composite” (e.g.,
Stalevski et al. 2012).

In Figure 2 we show few examples of observed 12MGS
SEDs decomposed into stellar, AGN and star-formation
components using the above described technique. The torus
emission, when needed by the ﬁt, is shown as green dashed
line. The decomposition code provides a probability distri-
bution function (PDF) in each photometric band and for
each ﬁt component, allowing an estimate of the uncertainty
related to each decomposed contribution. In Figure 3 we
show an example of an observed SED, with the galaxy and
AGN components deﬁned by their uncertainty regions ob-
tained through the PDF analysis (green for the torus and
red for the host galaxy). The IRS spectrum associated to
the same 12MGS object is also shown (and zoomed) in a
separate panel.

In Table 3 we report the main results obtained from the
SED-ﬁtting decomposition described in the previous section.
In particular, in Columns # 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, for each
source we list the total IR luminosity (obtained by integrat-
ing the SED in the 8–1000 µm rest-frame, LTOT
IR ), the SFR
(obtained through the Kennicutt 1998 relation converted to
a Chabrier IMF), the IR luminosity due to SF (LSF
IR ), the IR

luminosity due to AGN accretion(LAGN
IR ), the fraction of 5–
40µm luminosity produced by an AGN (fAGN(5 − 40)) and
the AGN bolometric luminosity (LAGN
bol ) respectively. The
AGN bolometric luminosity is obtained through a bolomet-
ric correction (BC) available for each AGN template. The
BC allows us to calculate LAGN
bol directly from the IR (1–1000
µm rest-frame) luminosity of the best-ﬁtting AGN model. In
the last three Columns, for comparison, we report the AGN
bolometric luminosity derived from the X-ray (by Bright-
man & Nandra 2011a), the [Ne V]14.3 and 24.3µm and the
[O IV]25.9µm luminosities (by Tommasin et al. 2010) re-
spectively. The uncertainties associated to the parameters
derived through the SED decomposition have been obtained
from the PDF distribution provided by the ﬁtting routine.
The SED decomposition code provides the fraction of
luminosity due to the AGN in several infrared bands (1–5

µm, 5–10 µm, 10–20 µm, 5–40 µm, 8–1000 µm): for our pur-
pose we have chosen to represent the diﬀerent AGN fractions
in the 5–40 µm band, since it is large enough not to be too
sensitive to small scale variations like PAHs, but it is where
the AGN contribution – if any – should come out and be
maximised with respect to stellar and SF ones.

tribution. While there is basically no diﬀerence in the z-

Seyfert (i.e., HII regions and LINERs), as deﬁned through optical

diﬀerent colours, as explained in the legend.

0.1<z<0.2 and no type 2’s in that range), type 2 AGN tend
to have lower AGN fractions than type 1s (more numerous
at higher AGN fractions), although the total (type1+type2)
AGN fraction distribution is almost ﬂat. We note that the
optical classiﬁcation is biased against obscuration/torus ori-
entation and often doesnt match with X-ray type 1/type
2 deﬁnition or with IR/SED-ﬁtting classiﬁcation. However,
the general trend of type 1 AGN showing higher intrinsic
AGN fractions is not surprising, since it has been shown
statistically in Table 8 of Tommasin et al. (2010) for this
speciﬁc sample, and it is also in agreement with the results
of other works (i.e., Veilleux et al. 2009; Brightman & Nan-
dra 2011a; Netzer 2015 and references therein).

In Fig. 5 we show the fraction of luminosity due to the
AGN in the 5–40 µm range against that in the 8–1000 µm
range, and the ratio between the two fractions versus the
[O IV] 25.9µm luminosity, for the diﬀerent types of 12MGS
galaxies – i.e., Seyfert 1/1.5/1.8/1.9/2 and non-Seyfert, as
deﬁned through optical spectroscopy and 12 µm and X-ray
luminosity. From the former diagram it is clear that, even
if this sample is biased towards AGN-dominated objects
(showing signiﬁcantly high fractions of the total IR luminos-
ity due to AGN), in the 5–40 µm band, the AGN contribu-
tion is always higher than in the 8–1000 µm range. The two
contributions become similar for objects showing the high-
est AGN fractions (e.g., totally dominated by the AGN). We
can also notice that Seyfert 1/1.5 galaxies show, on aver-
age, higher L[O IV] and higher AGN fractions (both at 5–40
and 8–1000 µm), but tend to populate the lower fAGN(5 −
40)/fAGN(8 − 1000) part of the diagram (e.g., have higher
far-IR to mid-IR luminosity ratios). The AGN-dominated
objects (those with fAGN(5 − 40)/fAGN(8 − 1000)∼1 and
both, L(8 − 1000µm) and L(5 − 40µm) dominated by the
AGN) are more likely to be optically classiﬁed as type 1 than
type 2. On the contrary, the non-Seyfert/LINER classiﬁed
objects are mostly at higher fAGN(5 − 40)/fAGN(8 − 1000)
(e.g., dominate the mid-IR rather than the far-IR) and (as
expected) have lower [O IV] luminosities. Seyfert 2/1.9/1.8
galaxies are spread over the whole range of AGN fraction
ratios and luminosities. Low [O IV] luminosities seem to
correspond to higher mid-to-far-IR fraction ratios. This can

be interpreted as the far-IR range to be dominated by SF,
as expected for low-luminosity AGN as LINERs, with the
AGN showing up mostly in the mid-IR, where the galaxy
SED shows a dip.
We have applied a two sample K-S test, to provide an as-
sessment of the likelihood that the Seyfert 1s and Seyfert
2s samples were drawn from the same parent distribution.
First we have considered the Seyfert 1’s and Seyfert 2’s
distributions plotted in Fig. 5, including the intermediate
types (1.5/1.8/1.9) in the Seyfert 2 category. We derive that
the probability that the two distributions are drawn from
the same parent one is P =0.03 (the test statistic, or the
maximum diﬀerence, is D=0.299). Then we have performed
again the test, by considering all the intermediate types in
the Seyfert 1 class. As a result, this time we found P =0.06
(D=0.359). Therefore, in both cases, the two cumulative fre-
quency distributions are more likely to be randomly sampled
from populations with diﬀerent distributions, although the
signiﬁcance of this diﬀerence is only about 2σ.

4.2 AGN bolometric luminosity

In Figure 6 the AGN bolometric luminosity that we de-
rive from the SED decomposition (e.g., from the best-ﬁtting
torus model) is compared to the same quantity obtained
by means of diﬀerent methods: i.e. from the 2–10 keV X-

ray luminosity (from IPAC-NED public Database), and the
AGN mid-IR line luminosity (e.g., [Ne V] and [O IV]; Tom-
masin et al. 2008, 2010). The agreement is good, espe-
cially with the mid-IR line derivations (scatter around the
1-1 relations: σX =1.11, σ[N e V ]14.3=0.61, σ[N e V ]24.3=0.66,
σ[O IV ]25.9=0.7). The signiﬁcance level associated with these
correlations has been derived by calculating the Spearmans
partial rank correlation coeﬃcients between two variables
independent on a third (the distance in our case), by follow-
ing the method described by Macklin (1982). The resulting
signiﬁcance level of these relations is 1.5σ, 3.4σ, 3.3σ and
3.2σ for the AGN luminosity derived from X-ray, [Ne V]14.3,
[Ne V]24.3 and [O IV]25.9 respectively.

We note that the relation between SED-ﬁtting and X-
ray derived AGN bolometric luminosity is more dispersed
and with a lower signiﬁcance than those with mid-IR AGN
lines. This is likely due to a signiﬁcant number of objects
showing values of the AGN bolometric luminosity estimated
from the X-ray band lower than those derived by decom-
posing the SED. These objects are well known obscured
AGN (with weak X-ray emission, i.e., IRASF07599+6508,
IRASF08572+3915, MRK0231, UGC05101), for which the
intrinsic X-ray luminosity obtained by means of a correction
for obscuration may be underestimated. Moreover, most of
the objects deviating from the relations are at relatively low
X-ray luminosities (<1043.5 erg/s), where the X-ray classi-
ﬁcation as AGN is less certain and the contamination due
to starburst can be signiﬁcant (e.g., Brightman & Nandra
2011b consider“unambiguos X-ray AGN” only sources with
an observed 2–10 keV luminosity greater than 1042 erg/s).
We are testing these hypothesis by re-analysing the X-
ray spectra of the 12MGS, including also recent data from
the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR; Har-
rison et al. 2013), when available (Vignali et al. in prepara-
tion). Indeed, the objects showing larger deviance from the
relation are also known to be highly obscured AGN from
the literature (e.g., some of them being Compton Thick,
>∼ 1024 cm−2). Note that the objects for which we
CT: NH
ﬁnd a higher fraction of mid-IR luminosity due to the AGN
are also those with higher bolometric luminosities.

4.3 The AGN-SF connection

In Figure 7 we plot the IR luminosity due to SF (LSF
IR ) ver-
sus the AGN bolometric luminosity (LAGN
bol ), using diﬀerent
colours to highlight sources with diﬀerent AGN fractions. A
correlation between the two quantities plotted here has been
found in the literature for QSOs (at z∼0: Netzer et al. 2007,
and at z=2–3: Lutz et al. 2008) and for type II AGN (Net-
zer 2009), with a slope of about 0.8 (LSF∝(LAGN
bol )0.8). More
recent studies, based on Herschel data up to z∼2–3 (Shao
et al. 2010; Rosario et al. 2012) demonstrate that the LSF–
LAGN plane can be divided into two regimes with very dif-
ferent behaviours. One is the ”SF-dominated” regime, where
LSF>LAGN, and the two properties are not correlated and
LSF exceeds LAGN by a factor that depends on redshift.
In the second ”AGN-dominated” regime, where LAGN>LSF,
the two luminosities seem to correlate as LSF∝(LAGN)0.7. In
all these works the assumption is that the 60 µm luminosity
is totally due to SF (LSF=νLν (60µm)); moreover the way
the samples are selected strongly aﬀects the distribution in
the LSF-LAGN plane (e.g., Page et al. 2012; Harrison et al.

a For this source we do not ﬁnd evidence of the presence of an AGN from the SED-ﬁtting analysis. However, the detection of mid-IR
lines as [NeV] and [OIV] in the mid/far-IR spectra (see Table 1), and a recent analysis of the X-ray data including new NUSTAR
data, indicate the possible presence of a heavily buried, Compton-thick AGN (Pozzi et al. in preparation).

2012; Lanzuisi et al. in preparation). Our sample is local,
therefore we can compare our result with those found in the
local Universe (Netzer et al. 2007; Netzer 2009): indeed a
broad correlation is observed in our data between LSF
IR and
, with a slope similar to 0.8 and a scatter of ∼0.6
LAGN
around the relation. However, as clearly noticeable from the
colour gradient of the symbols in ﬁgure 7, if we divide the
sample in sub-samples with similar AGN fractions, the rela-
tion narrows signiﬁcantly (scatter around the relation: ∼0.35
for fAGN(5 − 40)<30%, ∼0.28 for 30%<fAGN(5 − 40)<70%,
∼0.30 for fAGN(5 − 40)>70% ), while the normalisation in-
creases with decreasing fAGN(5 − 40) (e.g., sources with
higher AGN fractions show lower SF luminosity at ﬁxed
AGN bolometric luminosities), although the slope for dif-
ferent intervals of AGN contribution keeps similar to that
found by Netzer et al. (2007) for local AGN samples.
Indeed, if we calculate the Spearman’s partial rank correla-
tion coeﬃcient for this correlation (to derive the signiﬁcance,
independent on redshift), we ﬁnd that LSF
for
the whole sample are loosely correlated (signiﬁcance ∼1σ),
while the correlation becomes signiﬁcant (at >∼ 3σ level) if
we divide the sources according to their AGN fraction (i.e.,
intervals of fAGN discussed above). These results imply that
at ﬁxed SF luminosity, sources with higher AGN luminosity
have also higher AGN contribution in the mid-IR. On the
other hand, at a ﬁxed AGN fraction, the AGN luminosity
closely correlates with the SF luminosity, with apparently
no dependency on luminosity (i.e., the correlation holds for
low and high luminosity sources).
Recently, Theios, Malkan & Ross (in preparation) decom-
posed the Hα luminosity of a representative sample of the
12MGS Seyferts into LSF
by means of narrow
band ﬁlter imaging, also ﬁnding a correlation between the
two quantities, not entirely due to selection eﬀects. The cor-
relation is diﬀerent for Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 1.9/2: Seyfert

1s show greater nuclear Hα luminosities, due to the presence
of broad line regions.
Our result conﬁrms previous ones for local AGN, showing
that in the local Universe the SF and accretion luminosities
are intimately connected. They might also reﬂect a relation
between fAGN(5− 40) and LSF
, so that galaxies with
higher AGN fraction tend to have higher AGN luminosi-
ties for a given LSF
IR . Hints of SF luminosity independent
on the accretion one, i.e. the ”SF-dominated” regime, are
apparently observed for few galaxies with very low AGN
contribution (fAGN

5 AGN/SB DIAGNOSTICS

IR lines can be excited primarily by star formation (SF),
by an AGN or by both. The typical AGN lines are three
([Ne V] 14.3µm, [Ne V] 24.3µm and [O IV] 25.9µm), while
the lines and features that are mainly produced in star form-
ing regions are: PAH 6.2µm, PAH 11.2µm, [Ne II] 12.8µm,
[S III] 18.7µm, [S III] 33.5µm, [Si II] 34.5µm, [O I] 63µm,
[N II] 121.9µm, [O I] 145.5µm, and [C II] 157.7µm. The
other lines from [S IV] 10.5µm, [Ne III] 15.5 µm, [O III]
52µm, [N III] 57µm and [O III] 88µm, are excited by both
AGN and newly born stars. All these lines cover a wide pa-
rameter space of the critical density versus ionisation poten-
tial diagram, tracing diﬀerent astrophysical conditions: from
PDRs, to stellar/H II regions, to the AGN, and coronal line
regions (Spinoglio & Malkan 1992). This makes the combi-
nation of their ratios very useful for the deﬁnition of AGNs
versus star formation diagnostic diagrams (e.g., Spinoglio &
Malkan 1992; Genzel et al. 1998; Smith et al. 2007b). Higher
ionisation lines (i.e., [Ne III] 15.5 µm, [O IV] 25.9 µm, [O III]
at 52 and 88 µm and [N III] 57 µm) are excited in H II re-
gions, but can be excited also in AGN narrow-line regions

(NLR) with typical conditions (e.g. high densities and ioni-
sation potentials). Therefore, in composite objects (like the
great majority of our Seyfert galaxies, containing both a SF
and an AGN component), the total line emission is the sum
of the two components. The two [Ne V] lines at 14.3 and 24.3
µm are exclusively excited by AGN and can be considered
AGN spectral signatures (e.g., Tommasin et al. 2010), while
the [O IV] 25.9µm line is at least a factor of 10 brighter,
with respect to the continuum, in AGN than in starburst
galaxies (e.g., Pereira-Santaella et al. 2010).

One of our aims is to test and calibrate our results in
terms of accretion luminosity and AGN fractions using mid-
and far-IR spectral features. First, we test the diagnostic
diagrams commonly used in the literature to estimate the
AGN contribution (e.g., through the [Ne V] to [Ne II] line
ratio) and the star formation contribution (e.g., with the
EWs of the 11.25 µm PAH feature). In fact, since [Ne V]
14.3µm and [O IV] 25.9µm are the best AGN tracers in the
Spitzer-IRS spectral range, their normalisation to the [Ne II]
12.8µm (mainly produced in the H II/SF regions), can pro-
vide ionisation-sensitive ratios with all the sources (type 1s
and type 2s) lying along the same sequence, as extensively

MNRAS 000, 1–24 (2015)

discussed by Tommasin et al. (2010). This diagram can be
used to estimate the ionising power in the NLR, both in
type 1 and 2 AGN. Therefore, the clear positive correla-
tion represents an excitation sequence anchored with the H
II/LINERs, moving up in excitation level to the Seyfert 2s
and Seyfert 1s, and ending with the PG QSOs (Veilleux et al.
2009). Pereira-Santaella et al. (2010) used the photoioniza-
tion code MAPPINGSIII (Groves et al. 2004) to interpret
some of the AGN line ratios considered in this ﬁgure, ﬁnding
basically no diﬀerences between type 1 and type 2 AGN.
In Figure 8 we show the line ratios [Ne V] 14.3µm/[Ne II]
12.8µm (top left panel), [O IV]25.9µm/[Ne II]12.8µm (top
right),
[Ne V] 14.3µm/[Si II] 34.8µm (bottom left) and
[NeIII]15.5µm/[Ne II] 12.8µm (bottom right) as a function
of the EW of the PAH feature at 11.25 µm. The top and
bottom diagrams show the same line ratios as reported in
Fig. 4 and 5 of Tommasin et al. (2010), although the AGN
in that work were classiﬁed based on mid-IR line diagnos-
tics. Our classiﬁcation based on SED decomposition seems
to agree well with the previous ones, with all the objects
with high AGN fraction (e.g., >70%) showing an absolute
value of the EW of the PAH at 11.25 µm <0.1 µm and a

neon ratio [Ne V]/[Ne II]>0.1. On the other hand, most of
the objects with low fAGN (e.g., <30%) have |EW PAH|>0.1
µm and [Ne V]/[Ne II]<0.5. The diagrams PAH EW versus
[O IV]/[Ne II], [Ne V]/[Si II] and [Ne III]/[Ne II] show sim-
ilar characteristics as the previous one: the line ratio (and
the AGN fraction) increases when the absolute value of the
PAH EW decreases. All these diagrams show the general
inverse relation between the AGN dominance, as measured
from the SED ﬁtting and the ionisation sensitive line ratios,
and the star formation dominance, estimated from the PAH
EW. We note that the strong PAH emission detected in the
spectra of low- and high-z samples of AGN (e.g., Lutz et al.
2008, Hanami et al. 2012, Castro et al. 2014, Alonso-Herrero
et al. 2014), providing evidence for intense star formation in
the hosts of these sources, are not in contrast with our result,
that show basically no feature for sources AGN-dominated
in the 5–40 µm range, not depending on the strength of the
central AGN.

Figure 9 shows diﬀerent diagnostics using mid- and
far-IR line ratios and/or far-IR luminosity/ﬂux, commonly
used in the literature to segregate AGN-dominated sources
from SF-dominated ones: [O IV] 25.9µm/[Ne II] 12.8µm

and [C II]158µm+[O I] 63µm versus ([C II] 158µm+[O I]
63µm) / LFIR (bottom right). As in the previous Figure, the
ionisation-sensitive ratios ([O IV]/[Ne II] and [Ne V]/[Ne II])
show higher values for sources with higher AGN fractions.

Figure 9. Mid-/far-IR line diagnostics commonly used to sepa-
rate AGN from star-formation powered sources. As in the pre-
vious ﬁgures and as shown in the top colour-bar, the diﬀer-
ent colours of the symbols represent diﬀerent fractions of the
AGN contribution to the 5–40 µm luminosity, as derived from
our SED-ﬁtting decomposition. The black ﬁlled triangles in the
top left panel show, for comparison, the location of the Palomar
Green (PG) QSOs in the [O IV]/[Ne II] vs. [Ne V]/[Ne II] plane
(Schweitzer et al. 2006).

The diagnostic shown in the upper right panel is commonly
used to estimate the level of contamination due to star-
formation in the [O IV] line (or, rather, the sources for which
an AGN is needed to explain the [O IV] emission): the higher
[O IV]/FIR ratios shown by our AGN dominated sources are
consistent with our expectations based on previous results
(e.g., Sturm et al. 2010; Graci´a-Carpio et al. 2011).
As discussed also by Spinoglio et al. (2015), the [C II]158µm
/ [O I] 63µm versus the [O III] 88µm/[O IV] 25.9µm line ra-
tio (see bottom left panel), although the 12MGS sources with
measured far-IR lines are just few, is able to separate AGN
dominated sources from SF dominated ones (in particular,
the [O III]/[O IV] ratio). The [C II]/[O I] line ratio is only
weakly able to segregate sources with diﬀerent fractions of
AGN, although we observe on average lower ratio values for
AGN-dominated objects.
The bottom right panel shows the [C II] 158µm/[O I] 63µm
versus ([C II] 158µm+[O I] 63µm) / FIR diagram: sources
with higher AGN fractions are located preferentially at lower
[C II]/[O I] ratio values and at higher ([C II]+[O I])/FIR val-
ues. [O I] and [C II] are the brightest cooling lines of the cool
ISM in galaxies. However, ISO showed the [C II] line in local
ULIRGs to be about an order of magnitude lower relative
to the FIR continuum than in normal and starburst galax-
ies (e.g., Malhotra et al. 2001; Luhman et al. 2003). The
[C II]/[O I] ratio is known to be sensitive to gas density in

star-forming galaxies (e.g., Genzel & Cesarsky 2000), with
the ratio decreasing with increasing density (PDRs account
for more than half of the [C II] emission in starburst galaxies,

to [C II]), while the larger values of the ([C II]+[O I])/FIR

values and not a deﬁcit in the major PDR cooling lines rel-
ative to the FIR. A detailed discussion on the line ratios
characteristics and sensitivity to ionisation and density is
given by Spinoglio et al. (2015), but it is far from the scope
of this work: here we plot these diagnostics uniquely with
the aim of checking our decomposition results and their re-
liability (in particular to verify that objects with diﬀerent
AGN fractions are located where expected). Indeed, we see

a trend in our data, in all panels and ﬁgures, with AGN-
to-SF dominated line ratios increasing with increasing AGN
fraction.

6 LINE-LUMINOSITY RELATIONS

We ﬁnd that the luminosities of the mid-/far-IR lines of
our 12MGS subsample correlate with both the total IR lu-
minosity due to SF (LSF
IR ) and the bolometric luminosity
of the AGN (LAGN
bol ). The best-ﬁtting parameters (the inter-
cept and slope constants) of the linear relations (on a log-log
scale) and their associated probable uncertainties have been
derived by minimising the chi-square error statistic, consid-
ering the data errors on both axes. In Figure 10 we plot the

mid-IR line luminosity versus the total IR luminosity due
to SF (left panels) and versus the AGN bolometric luminos-
ity (right panels), as derived from the SED decomposition
(Section 4). The linear relations best-ﬁtting the data are
reported, together with their intrinsic scatter (grey regions
around the relations). Note that the intrinsic scatter con-
sidered here represents the dispersion, σ, given by the rms
deviation of the data from the mean relationship, obtained
by considering a Gaussian distribution around the mean (see
Bonato et al. 2014a,b). Therefore, the shaded bands shown
in the plots represent the ±1σ uncertainty regions that we
need to take into account when we derive the line LFs by
converting the total IR/AGN LFs using these relations (see
next Section).
The relations between the (fewer) far-IR line and LSF
IR (lef t)
and LAGN
(right) luminosities are shown in Figure 11, with
their intrinsic scatter as in the previous ﬁgure. We stress
that, although for some lines and sources there are upper
limits, they are available not for all the considered lines (e.g.,
the collection of data is not always uniform), having just no
data or no observation in some cases (mainly for the far-IR
lines, but also for some mid-IR ones). Therefore, for homo-
geneity, we decided not to consider any upper limits in our

bol

analysis, but only detections, although when available, we
plot the limits as pointing-down arrows in the ﬁgures.
From the left panels of Fig. 10, we note that for the SF-
dominated lines (i.e., PAHs, [Ne II], etc.) a unique relation
is derived between the line and the SF luminosity, regard-
less of the AGN fraction; while for the AGN-dominated lines
(i.e., [Ne V], [O IV], etc.) the relation changes as the AGN
fraction increases. In particular, by dividing the sample in
two (according to fAGN(5–40µm)> and <40%), we ﬁnd that
galaxies in the higher fAGN sub-sample show higher (AGN-
dominated) line luminosity at a given SF luminosity. These
results are conﬁrmed by the location of the PG QSOs (AGN-
dominated) in some of these diagrams (shown for compari-
son as black ﬁlled triangles), as derived by Schweitzer et al.
(2006): they always occupy the same region of our sources
with higher AGN fraction (i.e., are at higher line luminosi-
ties in the [Ne V] and [O IV] vs. SF luminosity diagrams
and mixed up with the other sources regardless the AGN
fraction in the [Ne II] vs. SF luminosity one). The opposite
happens to the relation between the line luminosity and the
AGN bolometric luminosity (see the right panels of Fig. 10):
at a given LAGN
, sources with higher AGN fraction show
lower (SF-dominated) line luminosity, but the same line lu-

minosity if the lines are AGN-dominated (just one correla-
tion, regardless their fAGN). This reﬂects the fact that lines
mostly excited by SF have a major contribution not related
to the AGN, with their luminosity enhanced for higher SF
fraction (lower AGN fraction) with respect to sources with
similar AGN luminosity, but lower SF fraction (higher AGN
one). The signiﬁcance level associated to these luminosity-
luminosity correlations, independent on redshift, is derived
through the Spearman partial rank correlation coeﬃcients
(Macklin 1982). We ﬁnd a high signiﬁcance for the corre-
lations between all the mid-IR lines and the IR luminosity
due to SF (between ∼3 and 7σ) and between the AGN mid-
IR lines (i.e., [Ne V], [Ne III] and [O IV]) and the AGN
bolometric luminosity (at >∼ 3.5σ). Instead, the signiﬁcance
is lower between SF-dominated lines and AGN bolometric
luminosity (between ∼1 and ∼2σ), but increases to 2.5σ –

MNRAS 000, 1–24 (2015)

5σ for the sub-samples deﬁned according to fAGN(5–40µm)<
or >40%.

Note that, since a measure of the far-IR lines are avail-
able only for a limited number of sources, the results (in
terms of linear coeﬃcients and signiﬁcance) obtained by di-
viding the sample in two (according to the fAGN (5–40µm)
< or >40% criterion) are not wholly meaningful, given the
very large uncertainties. However, the trend of sources with
higher AGN fraction showing brighter IR lines (due to SF)
found for the mid-IR lines (more numerous and statistically
signiﬁcant sample) is conﬁrmed also for the far-IR lines.

7 THE LINE LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS

Our understanding of the cosmological evolution of IR
sources has dramatically improved in recent years, but
studying the co-evolution of star formation and black hole
accretion is still one of main scientiﬁc goals of the future
astrophysical missions, both in the X-rays and in the IR.
Observational determinations of the evolution of the IR pop-
ulation up to z(cid:39)4 are now available thanks to Herschel (e.g.,
Gruppioni et al. 2013), although the major step forward will
be the characterisation and the evolution with redshift of
their physical properties. This will be possible only through
IR spectroscopy, provided by planned or forthcoming facili-
ties, like, e.g., JWST and SPICA, that will explore the dis-
tant Universe in the near-/mid-IR and mid-/far-IR respec-
tively. In order to understand what will be spectroscopically
observable for galaxies and AGN, we need to estimate the
redshift and galaxy luminosity ranges that can be measured,
based on the line luminosity functions. A key ingredient to
make such estimates is the relationship between the line and
the total IR (or SF/AGN) luminosity, that will allow us to
rely on the evolution of the IR (SF/accretion) luminosity
function: to this purpose, we use the ratios obtained in the
previous section, between the line luminosity and the to-
tal IR (SF/AGN) luminosity, to derive the mid-/far-IR line
LFs.

Note that, converting the accretion LFs (e.g., Hopkins
et al. 2007; Delvecchio et al. 2014) using the relations
found between the line luminosity and the AGN accretion
luminosity, and the SFR LFs (e.g., Gruppioni et al. 2015)
is probably the most appropriated approach for the AGN
dominated lines (or for objects containing an AGN, at any
level of dominance) and the SF dominated ones respectively.
However, the AGN bolometric luminosity and the SFR
depend on several assumptions: the former i.e., on the
bolometric correction, needed whatever the AGN selection
would be, which depends on the observing band and -
strongly - on the considered AGN model; the latter on the
stellar population synthesis models, their SF histories, etc..
For this reason, they are not quantities directly measurable
by the observations as, instead, is the total IR luminosity
(very robust if far-IR data are available). Therefore, here
we decide to use the total IR LF (and the line - total IR
luminosity relations: e.g., coeﬃcient a and b in Table 4)
instead of the SFR or accretion LFs, since the adopted ap-
proach is more direct and applicable to virtually any galaxy
samples observed in the IR, for which a measure of the total
IR LF is available. As a quality test, we have also followed
the other approach, converting the AGN bolometric LFs
derived by Delvecchio et al. (2014) into line LFs through
the line – AGN luminosity relations (coeﬃcient c and d in
Table 4) for the AGN-dominated lines ([Ne V], [Ne III],
[O IV]), and the SFR LFs by Gruppioni et al. (2015) and
the line – SF luminosity relations (coeﬃcient e and f in
Table 4) for the other lines (SF-dominated). The line LFs

The line LFs can be easily computed from the total IR
ones by convolving the latter with the distribution of the
IR-to-line luminosity ratios, assumed to be a Gaussian with
mean value given by the best-ﬁtting relations and standard
deviation equal to the intrinsic dispersion (which must be
added to the data errors to obtain the total uncertainty in
the relations). The detailed LF analysis performed by Grup-
pioni et al. (2013) and the evolutions found for the diﬀerent
populations, allow us to convert the total IR LF not “glob-
ally”, with an average relation, but considering the Herschel
populations separately by using the line-to-total IR luminos-
ity relations corresponding to their median AGN fraction
(in the 5–40 µm range, as derived by Delvecchio et al. 2014
through an accurate SED decomposition). We therefore con-
vert the total IR LFs applying the appropriate relation to
each population of IR objects observed by Herschel, given
the average AGN fraction of that population. In particu-
lar, Gruppioni et al. (2013) divided the IR population in
ﬁve main classes, based on their broad-band SEDs: spiral,
starburst, SF-AGN (sub-divided into SF-AGN(Spiral) and
SF-AGN(SB) as they represent low-luminosity and obscured
AGN respectively), AGN1 and AGN2. Successively, Delvecchio
et al. (2014) performed a SED decomposition analysis (as
the one performed in this work), deriving the AGN bolo-
metric luminosity and the fraction of AGN luminosity in
diﬀerent wavelength ranges for each source considered by
Gruppioni et al. (2013). Since the average fAGN(5 − 40)
found for the AGN1 and AGN2 populations (e.g., those with
AGN-dominated SEDs) is larger than 40%, we have consid-
ered the relation found for sources with an AGN contribu-
tion to the 5–40 µm luminosity larger than 40%. For all the
other populations (i.e., spiral, starburst, SF-AGN(Spiral)
and SF-AGN(SB)), we have instead considered the relation
for sources with less than 40% of AGN (since their average
fAGN(5 − 40) resulted lower).

Note that, since there is virtually no contribution of star
forming galaxies to the [Ne V] lines, we have not converted
to [Ne V] LFs the total IR LFs of the two populations pow-
ered by star-formation (i.e., spiral and starburst galax-
ies), while for the [Ne III] 15.5 µm and [O IV] 25.9µm lines
we have derived (and applied to those two population LFs)
a relation for the SF component only by using the pure star-
burst sample of Bernard-Salas et al. (2009). For all the other
lines, we have considered the emission to be dominated by
star-formation and we have applied the derived relations to
all the lines (according to the diﬀerent AGN fractions).

In Figure 12 we show an example of line LF ([O IV] 25.9
µm), where the contributions of the diﬀerent populations
are hilighted by diﬀerent colours (described in the legend)
and the total contribution (sum of all the populations), with
its uncertainty region (obtained by considering the intrinsic
and measurement errors in the relations) being shown as
grey ﬁlled area and compared to the result we would have
obtained by applying to the total IR LF a “global” average
relation for all the populations (described by the a and b
parameters in Table 4: black dashed line with uncertainty
region deﬁned by the hatched area).
We note that the LFs obtained by using the average re-

Gruppioni et al. (2013) through the Lline − LIR relations found in Section 6. The diﬀerent coloured lines represent the diﬀerent IR
populations (evolved and converted separately, according to their average AGN fraction), whose sum is shown by the grey band. The
black dashed line shows the LF obtained by converting the total IR LF using the average L[O IV] − LIR relation. The ﬁlled symbols in the

lation for all the sources or diﬀerent relations for diﬀerent
AGN fractions, are almost consistent within 2σ, although
at z<2 and L[O IV]>109 L(cid:12), the two LFs diﬀer by more
than 2σ (especially at 0.6<z<0.8). The main diﬀerence in
this particular case can be noticed at the bright end of the
line LF, where the AGN populations, if treated separately
with their speciﬁc line-to-total IR luminosity relation, give
a major contribution, mainly at z<2. A slight diﬀerence in
the LF knee is also observed in the same range of redshift,
with the “globally” converted line LF showing a higher Φ∗
and a lower L∗ with respect to the LF obtained by sum-
ming the diﬀerent population contributions. At z>2, where
AGN-dominated populations dominate the IR LFs (espe-
cially the bright-end), the diﬀerence is negligible, since the
average relation reﬂects the relation found for sources with
high AGN fraction. For comparison, at the lower redshift
(0.0<z<0.3) we have plotted also the values of the [O IV] LF
found by Tommasin et al. (2010) for the Seyfert 1 and 2 of

MNRAS 000, 1–24 (2015)

the 12MGS. The agreement with our estimates for AGN1 and
AGN2+SF-AGN(SB) is very good, although we stress that the
faint-end of our reference total IR LF for AGN-dominated
objects (i.e., AGN1 and AGN2) is not constrained at low red-
shift (e.g., the faint-end slope is taken from a higher z inter-
val, more populated by AGN at low luminosities). The faint-
end of our derived [O IV] LF is dominated by low-luminosity
AGN (SF-AGN(GAL)) and normal galaxies (spiral), which in
principle should not be included in the 12MGS. Note that
for lines mainly produced by SF, for which an average rela-
tion for all sources is found regardless of the AGN fraction
(i.e., PAHs, [Ne II], [S III], [Si II] and all the far-IR lines;
see Figs. 10 and 11), the two approaches here described are
equivalent.

For the sake of clarity, we note that the local relations
found in this work - then applied to the Herschel popula-
tions up to high z to derive the evolution of the line LFs - are
valid mainly at Lline<109 L(cid:12), while the observed discrep-

ancy occurs mainly at brighter luminosities. Unfortunately,
at present, no data are available to constrain the local bright-
end of the line LFs. The purpose of this work (and Section)
is to present a method based on the best currently available
data and models - improved with respect to the previous
ones (see Section 3) - to provide expected numbers of de-
tections in the diﬀerent IR lines. All this will be crucial for
planning spectroscopic surveys with the future facilities (see
next Section).

7.1 Predictions for future IR facilities

The line LFs obtained in the previous Section provide an
important tool to estimate how many sources will be ob-
servable in each of the considered mid-/far-IR lines with
any forthcoming/future/planned/eventual facilities in the
IR/sub-mm. With our LFs, we can not only derive numbers,
but redshift and luminosity distributions of the detectable
sources to any ﬂux limits, making it possible to plan future
spectroscopic surveys in a crucial, but totally unexplored
wavelength range for high-z sources.

In the next decades a few space IR facilities will be
put in orbit. Due to be launched in 2018, the JWST (Gard-
ner et al. 2006) will be the next NASA observatory that
will explore the Universe at near-/mid-IR wavelengths. The
MIRI instrument (Wright et al. 2010) is the only mid-IR in-
strument for JWST, performing photometric imaging in be-
tween 5 and 27 µm over a 2.3 arcmin2 ﬁeld-of-view (FOV),
and spectroscopy (including medium resolution, R ∼1500 to
3500, integral ﬁeld spectroscopy over a 13 arcsec2 FOV at
5–28.5 µm).

Complementary to JWST, SPICA (Nakagawa et al.
2012), to be proposed for the ESA 5th Medium missions
call (due launch in 2028-2030), will observe the Universe at
mid-/far-IR, from 10 to 37 µm with the SMI camera and
spectrograph (Kataza et al. 2015) and continuously from 34
to 230 µm with the SAFARI grating spectrograph (Roelf-
sema et al. 2014). The SPICA 2.5-m diameter mirror, cooled
down to <∼ 8 K, will allow us to reach unprecedented sensi-
tivities over an unexplored wavelength range, bridging the
gap between JWST and ALMA. The resulting number of
sources (per unit area) that will be detectable in each line as
a function of z with the MIRI IFU spectrograph (by consid-
ering the nominal sensitivities) and SPICA (by considering
the nominal sensitivities for the resolutions R∼1300–2300
and R∼300 for SM I and SAF ARI respectively), to 5σ in
10,000sec (time on-source only) are presented in Table 5 and
are plotted in the Figure 13.

Figure clearly shows the complementarity of JWST and
SPICA, the former being more eﬃcient in detecting PAH
features, but only the 6.2 µm one to high redshifts; the
other mid-IR lines will run out of the MIRI range at much
lower redshift, with [Ne V] 24.3 µm and [O IV] 25.9 µm be-
ing barely detectable up to z<0.1–0.2. Similarly, the SMI
contribution becomes less and less relevant for longer wave-
length lines (such as [Ne V] 24.3 µm and above) and is more
important at low redshifts, while SAFARI will allow us to
detect mid-IR lines up to z∼3–4. Note that, even for lines
produced mainly by SF, objects containing an AGN provide
a signiﬁcant contribution (green and red coloured area in
Fig. 13).

We must point out that the comparison between JWST

and SPICA based on source numbers per unit area (depend-
ing only on sensitivity) is not totally realistic, it can only tell
us the redshift ranges covered by the two missions. In order
to discuss about the real eﬃciency of detecting sources in
the diﬀerent lines, we have to take into account the dif-
ferent FOV of the diﬀerent instruments. Given its small
FOV, MIRI will not be a survey instrument, however, it will
be possible to perform very deep pencil-beam surveys over
small areas of the sky. The slit length of SMI (medium reso-
lution, R∼1300–2300) on SPICA is planned to be 60(cid:48)(cid:48)×3.7(cid:48)(cid:48),
while MIRI (medium resolution spectrograph, R∼2400) on
JWST will have a FOV ranging from 3(cid:48)(cid:48).6×3(cid:48)(cid:48).6 to 7(cid:48)(cid:48).6×7(cid:48)(cid:48).6
from 6.4 µm to 22.5 µm. Therefore, within the same amount
of time, SMI will scan an area of the sky ∼3.8 times larger
than MIRI, even considering the longest wavelength band of
the latter (with the larger FOV). As an example, in terms of
observing time, to cover an area like the HST eXtreme Deep
Field (XDF, 10.8 arcmin2) to the sensitivities considered in
our simulations (5σ, 10,000s on source), MIRI will have to
observe ∼ 1,800 hours, against the ∼470 hours of SMI. The
SAFARI grating spectrograph will only make pointed obser-
vations of single sources at a time, therefore a direct com-
parison with the areal coverage of the mid-IR instruments
is not possible. However, we have estimated that in ∼1,000
hours with SAFARI we will be able to observe (simulta-
neously over the whole 32-230 µm range) in at least three
lines ∼20 LIR(cid:54)1011 L(cid:12) sources at z∼1, ∼20 LIR(cid:54)1011.5
L(cid:12) sources at z∼2 and ∼20 LIR(cid:54)1012 L(cid:12) sources at z∼3.
These luminosities are below the knee of the IR LFs at the
corresponding redshifts.

Note also that MIRI/JWST has spectroscopic cover-
age only up to 28 µm, and therefore most of the atomic
and molecular diagnostic features will be inaccessible beyond
z∼2. ALMA, which is designed for the sub-mm wavelengths,
has coverage only beyond ∼330 µm and can be used to trace
important far-IR ﬁne structure lines (e.g. [C II] 157µm and
[O III] 88 µm) at high-redshift, but is blind to many of the
mid-infrared atomic, H2 and dust features. SPICA will pro-
vide a unique window on the physical processes fuelling star
formation and BH growth in the dusty Universe.

8 CONCLUSIONS

We have exploited all the information – both photometric
and spectroscopic, from X-rays to mm – available for 76
sources from the extensively studied 12MGS local sample of
Seyfert galaxies, to perform a broad-band SED-ﬁtting and
decomposition and obtain new relations between mid- and
far-IR line luminosity and AGN, SF and total IR luminosi-
ties, also investigating the variations of these relations for
diﬀerent fractions of AGN contribution. Thanks to the use
of all the data available for these objects, we were able to de-
rive crucial AGN and host galaxy quantities (i.e., the AGN
bolometric luminosity, the AGN fraction in diﬀerent wave-
length ranges, the SFR) and greatly reduce the uncertainties
and degeneracies with respect to similar SED-decomposition
works performed at high-z, where the very few photomet-
ric points available in the mid-IR/far-IR range (crucial to
constrain and separate the AGN and the starburst contri-
butions) lead to very uncertain results. The relations found
between the line luminosity and the SF or AGN or total

Mid-IR Line Luminosity as a tracer of BHAR

23

IR luminosities, reﬂecting a connection between the black
hole accretion and the SFR in the local AGN, are used to
estimate numbers, redshifts and luminosities of sources de-
tectable in the diﬀerent mid-/far-IR lines.

The main results of this work can be summarised as

follows:

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

We thank an anonymous referee for helpful comments that
improved the paper signiﬁcantly. We would also like to thank
Gianni Zamorani for his valuable help on the statistical tests
and results. CG acknowledges ﬁnancial contribution from
the contracts ASI-INAF I00507/1 and I005110.

• The observed broad-band SEDs of the 12MGS have
been decomposed into three diﬀerent components, peaking
in three diﬀerent regimes: evolved stars (optical/near-IR),
dust-heated by SF (far-IR/sub-mm) and AGN dusty torus
emission (mid-IR). Crucial physical quantities, as the SFR,
the AGN bolometric luminosity, the total IR luminosity due
either to SF or AGN, the AGN fraction in diﬀerent wave-
length ranges, are accurately derived, thanks to the wealth
of data available, including IRS spectra in the mid-IR.

• The 12MGS sources show all the range of AGN domi-
nance in the mid-IR (e.g., 5–40 µm), from about 90% to no
AGN at all.

• The AGN bolometric luminosity derived through the
SED decomposition is in good agreement with previous
derivations for the same objects from X-rays and high exci-
tation mid-IR lines (i.e., [Ne V], [O IV]).

• The SF luminosity is found to correlate nicely with the
AGN bolometric luminosity, with the dispersion in the rela-
tion caused by the diﬀerent fraction of AGN contribution to
the IR luminosity: the normalisation of the relation changes
with fAGN , but the slope keeps similar to that found by
Netzer et al. (2007, 2009) (e.g., sources with higher AGN
fraction show lower SF luminosity at a given AGN bolomet-
ric luminosity).

• The total IR luminosity, the SF luminosity and the in-
trinsic AGN bolometric luminosity are found to correlate
with the IR line luminosity. Variations of these relations with
diﬀerent AGN fractions are investigated resulting in higher
AGN-line luminosities for sources with larger AGN fractions
at given total IR luminosity, and no variation with the AGN
contribution for lines produced by SF. On the contrary, the
normalisation of the relation between the SF produced lines
and the AGN luminosity increases with decreasing AGN
fraction, while it shows no variation with the amount of
AGN relative contribution for AGN signature lines.

• These local line versus AGN/SF luminosity relations
are then used, together with the recent Herschel galaxy LF
and evolution results, to obtain IR line luminosity functions
up to high redshifts, in order to estimate for how many SF
galaxies and AGN we expect to detect and measure the mid-
/far-IR lines at diﬀerent redshifts and luminosities with the
forthcoming/planned future IR space missions (e.g., JWST,
SPICA).

Since the nuclear properties are likely to be more cor-
related than those averaged over the whole galaxy size, the
investigation of eventual relation between the nuclear AGN
activity and the circum-nuclear SF (rather than the global
SF) would shed more light on the AGN/host galaxy connec-
tion. Spatially resolved observations of the nuclei of these
Seyfert galaxies in the near-/mid-IR would be a natural ex-
tension of this work.

APPENDIX A: PHOTOMETRIC DATA

The photometric data for our 12MGS subsample of 76
sources with Spitzer-IRS spectra have been collected from
NED, Vizier and Simbad public databases in ﬁxed bands.
Here, for the ﬁrst time a “homogenised” photometric cat-
alogue is put together for this sample, with derived total
ﬂuxes (corrected for aperture and magnitude zero point). In
Table A1 and A2 data from UV to Spitzer-IRAC bands and
from 12 µm to 3 mm are presented respectively.
