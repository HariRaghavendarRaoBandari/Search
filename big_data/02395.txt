amplitude mode in addition to the Nambu-Goldstone phase mode associated with the spontaneous U(1)

using an eﬀective spin-1 model and the ﬁeld theoretical methods based on the ﬁnite-temperature Green’s
function. We calculate the damping rates up to 1-loop order and evaluate them analytically and numeri-
cally. We show that the damping rate of the Higgs mode increases with increasing the temperature but it
remains underdamped up to a typical temperature achieved in experiments. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the
Nambu-Goldstone mode attenuates via a Landau damping process resulting from interactions with the
Higgs mode and it can be overdamped at the typical temperature in a certain parameter region.

1 Introduction

In a system with spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry, there exists a gapless col-
lective mode that corresponds to a motion restoring the symmetry, namely the Nambu-Goldstone
mode [1, 2]. If the system also has a particle-hole symmetry, a gapful collective mode emerges. It
corresponds to ﬂuctuations of the order-parameter amplitude and is often referred to as the Higgs
mode because of its analogy with the Higgs scalar boson in the particle physics [3]. In recent years,
Higgs modes in condensed matter and ultracold gases have attracted particular attention [4, 5]
thanks to experimental developments for detecting those modes in various systems, including
superconductors NbSe2 [6–8] and Nb1−xTixN [9–12], quantum antiferromagnets TlCuCl3 [13, 14]
and KCuCl3 [15], charge-density-wave materials K0.3MoO3 [16, 17] and TbTe3 [18, 19], superﬂuid
3He B-phase [20, 21], and superﬂuid Bose gases in optical lattices [22, 23].

As for bosons in optical lattices, it has been predicted [24, 25] that the Higgs mode emerges
in the superﬂuid state near the quantum phase transition to the Mott insulator [26] at commensu-
rate ﬁllings, where the system has an approximate particle-hole symmetry [27]. The most careful
experimental analyses regarding the Higgs modes thus far have been made in Ref. [23]; a response
of two-dimensional (2D) gases to temporal modulation of the lattice amplitude has been measured
as a function of the modulation frequency by means of the optical-lattice microscope techniques.
Although the measured onset frequency of the response agrees with the theoretically computed
energy gap of the Higgs mode, the response exhibits a broad continuum above the onset rather
than a sharp peak. This means that the existence of the Higgs mode as a well-deﬁned resonance
has not yet been experimentally veriﬁed in this system.

The experiments of Ref. [23] have triggered extensive theoretical investigations on the Higgs
modes of 2D bosons in optical lattices [28–34]. In particular, previous studies using the quantum
Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D Bose-Hubbard model [28, 33] have shown that the broadening
of the spectral response is due to the combined eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations, ﬁnite temperatures,
and spatial inhomogeneity caused by the conﬁnement potential. Because eﬀects of quantum and
thermal ﬂuctuations are in general weaker in higher dimensions, it is expected that 3D systems
are advantageous over 2D for observing a resonance peak of the Higgs mode in experiments.
Altman and Auerbach [24] have indeed shown that the resonance peak of the Higgs mode in a
homogeneous Bose-Hubbard system at zero temperature is signiﬁcantly sharper in 3D than in 2D,
i.e., the damping of the Higgs mode is weaker in 3D. As a next step, it is important to address
eﬀects of ﬁnite temperatures in 3D.

Another interesting respect of the Higgs mode is that its interaction with the NG mode may
dramatically change properties of the latter mode. For instance, Nakayama et al. [35] recently
predicted the Fano resonance of the NG mode mediated by a bound Higgs mode localized around

2

potential barriers as a result of coupling between the two modes induced by the barriers. At ﬁnite
temperatures, dynamically excited NG modes can interact with thermally excited Higgs modes and
one of the natural consequences of such interactions should be the damping of the NG mode.

In this paper, we study damping of the Higgs and NG modes of 3D superﬂuid Bose gases in
homogeneous optical lattices in the vicinity of the Mott transition at commensurate ﬁllings, with
a particular focus on eﬀects of ﬁnite temperatures. To calculate the damping rates, we use a low-
energy eﬀective model [24], which has the same form as the S = 1 XY model with the uniaxial
single-ion isotropy, and the ﬁeld theoretic approach based on the ﬁnite-temperature Green’s func-
tion. We analytically obtain approximate expressions of the damping rates for the two modes and
also present numerical evaluations of the damping rates to clarify the validity region of the ana-
lytical formulae. We show that the damping rate of the Higgs mode at zero momentum increases
with increasing the temperature but it remains smaller than the oscillation frequency of the mode
at ﬁnite temperatures that can be realized in typical experiments. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the inter-
actions between the two modes allow for the Landau damping process of the NG mode, in which
the damping rate can be even larger than the mode frequency at the typical temperatures, i.e., the
NG mode can be overdamped.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we brieﬂy review the mapping of the Bose-
Hubbard model onto the eﬀective spin-1 model. In Sec. 3, we explain our methods to calculate
the damping rates at ﬁnite temperatures. In Sec. 4, using the formula obtained in Sec. 3, we cal-
culate the damping rate of the Higgs mode to discuss its dependence on the temperature and the
interaction strength. In Sec. 5, we discuss properties of the damping of the NG mode. In Sec. 6,
the results are summarized. Through out the below discussion, we set  = kB = a = 1, where , kB,
and a denote the reduced Plank constant, the Boltzmann constant, and the lattice constant.

2 Model

We consider ultra-cold bosonic atoms in a cubic optical lattice. Assuming that the lattice is
suﬃciently deep, the system can be described by the Bose-Hubbard model within the tight-binding
approximation [36, 37],

where a†i and ai denote the creation and annihilation operators for a boson at site i and satisfy the
bosonic commutation relations [ai, a†j] = δi, j, [ai, a j] = [a†i , a†j] = 0. Here, ¯n ≡ ha†i aii is the ﬁlling
factor. The symbol hi, ji denotes the nearest-neighbor sites. The parameters J, U, and δµ are the
hopping energy, the on-site interaction energy, and the chemical potential. Note that at a suﬃciently

3

large ﬁlling ¯n ≫ 1, δµ = 0 corresponds to the commensurate case, i.e. integer ﬁlling ¯n ∈ N. This
deﬁnition simpliﬁes the following derivation of the eﬀective model to describe the system near the
Mott phase with ﬁlling ¯n. In this paper, we focus on the high ﬁlling case.

In the vicinity of the ¯nth Mott phase, only three states {|¯n − 1ii, |¯nii, |¯n + 1ii} per site dominate
the low-energy behavior of the superﬂuid near the Mott phase because the local ﬂuctuations from
the mean-ﬁeld ground state in the Mott phase Qi |¯nii are suﬃciently suppressed so that we can
ignore the high-energy excited states {|¯n ± 2ii, |¯n ± 3ii, · · ·} in the complete Hilbert space. In the
reduced Hilbert subspace, the operators in Eq. (1) take an approximated form. In order to obtain the
speciﬁc expressions, it is convenient to introduce Schwinger bosons [38] in the following manner,

|¯n + 1ii = t†1i|vaci,

|¯nii = t†0i|vaci,

|¯n − 1ii = t†

−1i|vaci,

(2)

where |vaci is a vacuum of the Schwinger bosons. These operators satisfy the bosonic commutation
relations [tmi, t†n j] = δm,nδi, j (m, n = −1, 0, 1) and we impose a local constraintPm=1
m=−1 t†mitmi = 1 on
them to eliminate non-physical states, e.g. t†1it†0i|vaci. The operator t0i represents the local mean
ﬁeld in the Mott phase and t1i (t−1i) is the single particle (hole) excitaion at site i. The bosonic
operator a†i can be expressed in terms with the Schwinger bosons (2),

a†i

= √¯n + 1t†1it0i + √¯nt†0it−1i.

(3)

Substituting these expressions into the Bose-Hubbard model (1), we obtain the eﬀective model
which describes the low-energy behavior in the reduced space and has the same form as the XY
model with the uniaxial single-ion isotropy and the magnetic coupling [24],

and obey the standard SU(2) algebra. For ¯nJz/U ≫ 1, the ground state is the XY ferromagnetic
ordered state where the U(1) symmetry is spontaneously broken. Here z = 2d is the coordination
number and d = 3 is the spatial dimension of the system. For ¯nJz/U ≪ 1, the ground state has
the U(1) symmetry and the mean-ﬁeld wave function is given by Qi |S = 1, mz = 0ii ≡Qi |¯nii.

Notice that in the case h = δµ = 0 the eﬀective model (4) has the particle-hole symmetry, which
corresponds to the one emerging in the model (1) near the superﬂuid-Mott insulator transition at
commensurate ﬁllings. In fact, except the last term, the eﬀective model (4) is invariant under the
interchange of particle excitations t†1i (t1i) and hole excitations t†

−1i (t−1i).

3 Methods

3.1 Canonical transformation

Let us explain how to describe the collective excitations of the strongly correlated superﬂuid
by using the eﬀective model (4), within a mean-ﬁeld approximation developed by Altman and
Auerbach [24]. In the following discussion, we deal with the particle-hole symmetric case, i.e.
h = δµ = 0. First, we deﬁne a canonical transformation as

b0i = cos(θ0/2)t0i + sin(θ0/2)(t1i + t−1i)/ √2,
b1i = sin(θ0/2)t0i − cos(θ0/2)(t1i + t−1i)/ √2,
b2i = (t1i − t−1i)/ √2,

(6)

which generates a rotation of the old basis spanned by three Schwinger bosons (t1i, t0i, t−1i) into a
new basis. The new operators also satisfy the bosonic commutation relations [bmi, b†n j] = δm,nδi, j,
[bmi, bn j] = [b†mi, b†n j] = 0 and the local constraint Pm=2
m=0 b†mibmi = 1. The angle of transforma-
tion is given by θ0 = tan−1( √1 − u2/u), where u ≡ U/(4J ¯nz) is a dimensionless parameter. The

transformation (6) can be derived by the bosonic Gutzwiller mean-ﬁeld ansatz in the reduced
space [24, 25]. The operators b0i and b1i (b2i) stand for the mean-ﬁeld ground state and the exci-
tations in the Higgs (NG) branch. Note that in the mean-ﬁeld theory and the high-ﬁlling limit
¯n ≫ 1, the superﬂuid to Mott insulator transition occurs at uc = 1. In other words, a quantity
|u − uc| = |u − 1| measures the distance from the transition point.
3.2 Holstein–Primakoﬀ expansion

We assume that all of the ﬂuctuations from the mean-ﬁeld ground state are small. Then, the
eﬀective model (4) represented by the new basis bmi (b†mi) (m = 0, 1, 2) can be simpliﬁed by
m=0 b†mibmi = 1, this

employing a Holstein–Primakoﬀ expansion [39]. With the local constraint Pm=2

expansion eliminates b0i (b†0i) from the model (4) as

b†mb0 = b†mq1 − b†1b1 − b†2b2,

≈ b†m −

(7)

where m = {1, 2}. The higher order terms are ignored if we take into account the leading vertex
terms with third order with respect to the excitations. This approximation is similar to the spin-
wave expansion in the localized spin systems with long-range orders (more details can be found,
e.g., in Ref. [40]). Notice that in the case of ﬁnite temperatures the above truncation is valid only at
d ≥ 3. At lower dimensions, the thermal ﬂuctuations are so strong that they destroy the long-range

5

order of the mean-ﬁeld ground state [41–43] and one can not justify ignorance of the higher terms
in the expansion (7).

Substituting the expansion (7) into the model (4), we obtain the simpliﬁed model, which has

the sequent terms with each order, and would show them up to the third order,

the previous operator such that the coeﬃcients umk and vmk satisfy a relation |umk|2 − |vmk|2 = 1.
Assuming that umk and vmk are real numbers and imposing the condition that H(2)
eﬀ in the new
representation has no anomalous term, we determine the coeﬃcients,

where sgn(x) is the sign function. After the Bogoliubov transformation, Eq. (4) reads

The operator β†mk creates a quasi-particle with the excitation energy Emk, which is given by

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

E1k = 2J ¯nzq1 − u2γk,
E2k = J ¯nz(1 + u)p1 − γk.

It is easily seen that the dispersion of the Higgs mode E1k has a energy gap ∆ ≡ 2J ¯nz √1 − u2 at
zero momentum while that of the NG mode E2k is gapless. Obviously, the gap of the Higgs mode
closes at the critical point u = 1.

Equation (16) has the third order terms characterizing the interactions among the three exci-
tations. Speciﬁcally, H(3)
eﬀ has ﬁve types of interaction term, which are shown in Fig. 1, and their
Hermite conjugates. The interaction terms shown in Figs. 1(a) and (b) generate scattering pro-
cesses closed only in the Higgs branch while the terms shown in Figs. 1(c), (d), and (e) couple the
two diﬀerent branches with one Higgs mode and two NG modes. As we will see in the following
subsection, these terms cause damping of the elementary excitations. It is worth noting that H(3)
eﬀ
does not include vertices consisting only of the propagators of the NG mode. This is a generic

property of a superﬂuid with particle-hole symmetry [45] and is in stark contrast to the case of a
weakly interacting Bose gas, which has such vertices [46, 47].

When |k| ≪ 1, the above expressions are approximated with simpler forms. The simpliﬁcation
is done by the Taylor expansion of γk with respect to k. For example, the excitation energies (17)
and (18) become

(19)

E1k ≈ q∆2 + c2
E2k ≈ cng|k|,

h|k|2,

(20)
where ch = 2J ¯n√zu and cng = J ¯n√z(1 + u). Similarly, if we assume that u , uc, the coeﬃcients

(21)

(22)

These expressions are isotropic in the momentum space, thus allowing for analytical evaluations
of the damping rates.

3.4 Finite-temperature Green’s function

To calculate the damping rates of the Higgs and the NG modes, we use the ﬁeld-theoretical
approaches based on the ﬁnite-temperature Green’s function (See Ref. [48–50]). In our calculation,
we deﬁne the Green’s functions of the Higgs (m = 1) and the NG (m = 2) modes as

hβmk(iωn) ¯βmk(iωn)i ≡ R D(β, ¯β)βmk(iωn) ¯βmk(iωn)exp(−Seﬀ)

R D(β, ¯β)exp(−Seﬀ)

where ωn = 2πn/β (n = 0, ±1, ±2, · · · ) is the Matsubara frequency, β = T−1 is the inverse tem-

The contributions to each damping rate consist of only one type of the perturbative correction.
Figure 2 shows the Feynman diagrams that provide the non-zero contributions to the damping rates
(25) and (26). In general, there are other diagrams with diﬀerent structures from the ones shown in
Fig. 2. However, we ﬁnd that the actual contributions to the damping come from only the diagrams
depicted in Fig. 2 within the 1-loop order, because of the energy-momentum conservations laws,
which is represented as δ function in the equations (25) and (26).

The diagram shown in Fig. 2(a) means that the Higgs mode attenuates by decaying into the
two NG modes due to the quantum and thermal ﬂuctuations. This type of damping of collective
modes is called Beliaev damping [46, 51]. In general, the Beliaev damping can occur even at
zero temperature. The Beliaev damping of the Higgs mode at zero temperature is ﬁrst predicted by
Altman and Auerbach [24]. On the other hand, the diagram depicted in Fig. 2(b) means that the NG
mode attenuates through processes in which the initial NG mode absorbs another NG mode excited

thermally, and subsequently turns into the Higgs mode as the ﬁnal state. This type of damping is
called Landau damping [52, 53]. At zero temperature, this damping cannot occur because there is
no thermal excitation. Therefore, in the vicinity of the Mott phase, the NG mode does not attenuate
at zero temperature within the approximations discussed above.

4 Damping rate of the Higgs mode

In this section, we discuss the damping of the Higgs mode at ﬁnite temperatures by evaluating
the expression (25). In particular, we consider the case of the Higgs mode with zero momentum
because a typical perturbation used for exciting the Higgs mode in experiments is the lattice-
amplitude modulation with zero momentum [23].

First, let us evaluate the integrations of the formula (25) within a long-wavelength approxi-
mation, where E1k, E2k, umk, and vmk are approximated with Eqs. (19), (20), (21), and (22). This
approximation is better justiﬁed in a closer vicinity of the critical point, u = uc, where the energy
of the NG mode dominant to the damping of the Higgs mode, ∆/2, is smaller. Integrating with
respect to k1 and k2 in the r.h.s. of Eq. (25) within the approximation, we obtain a simple formula

Γ1k=0 =

33/2J ¯nz
23 √2π

(1 + u)p1 − u2coth

β∆

.

(28)

It is obvious from Eq. (28) that the dependence on temperature T is determined by the factor
coth(β∆/4). At T = 0 and |u − uc| ≪ 1, this factor becomes 1 and the damping rate behaves as
Γ1k=0 ∼ J ¯nz √1 − u2. This consequence agrees with the previous one obtained by Altman and

Auerbach [24]. In this sense, the analytic expression (28) gives the ﬁnite-temperature correction to
the previous result at zero temperature.

In Fig. 3, we show the dependence on u of the damping rate (28) at ﬁxed temperatures and
the comparison with the numerical calculation without the long-wavelength approximation. As
expected, the analytic results well coincide with the numerical data in the vicinity of u = uc while

10

they deviate as u decreases from u = uc. It is seen that for given u the damping rate monotonically
increases as the temperature increases. This tendency is stronger in a closer vicinity of the critical
point u = uc.

represent the analytic expression (28) and the dotted lines the numerical data, where N = 5003.

The dimensionless quantity Γ1k=0/∆ characterizes the behavior of the temporal oscillation
of the Higgs mode and determines the width of the resonance peak in the spectral function. If
Γ1k=0/∆ > 1, then the oscillation abruptly attenuates during one period, i.e., it is overdamped.
From Fig. 4, where Γ1k=0/∆ is plotted against u, we see that Γ1k=0/∆ increases as the critical
point is approached but the Higgs mode remains underdamped (Γ1k=0/∆ < 1) even at T = 0.3J ¯nz.
Provided the facts that ¯n ≫ 1 is assumed and that the temperature can be as low as T/J = O(1)
in typical experiments with bosons in optical lattices [23, 54], our result implies that the Higgs
mode has a sharp resonance peak in the spectral function at the typical temperatures at least in the
absence of a trapping potential. Notice that in Figs. 3 and 4 we did not show the data points in
the parameter region, where T > ∆ ∼ Tc, because our method is valid only in the superﬂuid phase.
Here, Tc denotes the transition temperature from the superﬂuid to the normal ﬂuid.

Our calculations do not take into account the logarithmic correction to the damping rate, which
stems from the renormalization of an eﬀective coupling constant because d = 3 is the upper critical
dimension [55]. Due to the correction, Γ1k=0/∆ at T = 0 approaches zero as ∼ 1/ ln|u − uc| in the
limit that u → uc. The ignorance of the logarithmic correction is not problematic in the practical
sense that the parameter region, where the correction is eﬀective, is so narrow that it is very diﬃcult
to observe either in experiments or in numerical simulations especially for dynamical quantities
like the damping rates.

5 Damping rate of the NG mode

In this section, we evaluate the damping rate of the NG mode expressed in Eq. (26) in speciﬁc
parameter regions of interest. In cold-atom experiments, the NG mode can be dynamically excited
by means of the two-photon Bragg scattering techniques [25, 56–58], which allows for a wide
control of the momentum k. Hence, we analyze the k-dependence of the damping rate in addition to
the u-dependence and the T -dependence. First, let us obtain analytical expressions of the damping
rate within the long-wavelength approximation. Substituting Eqs. (19), (20), (21), and (22) into
Eq. (26) and integrating it with respect to k1 and k2 except for the variable |k2| lead to

Γ2k = −

These parameters determine the maximum and minimum momenta of the thermally excited NG
modes that are absorbed by the initial NG mode in the Landau damping process. Carrying out the
remaining integration with respect to |k2|, we obtain

Γ2k =

35/2(1 + u)2(1 − u)

4β √2πu2k2

log

1 − e−βcng(kl+k)
1 − e−βcng(ku+k)

1 − e−βcngku
1 − e−βcngkl

.

(31)

We emphasize that this approximate expression (31) is well justiﬁed when kl ≪ 1. The condition
kl ≪ 1 can be converted to

z|u − uc| ≪ k,

12

(32)

meaning that Eq. (31) is valid only near the critical point. It is obvious that in the zero-temperature
limit (β → ∞) the damping rate (31) vanishes because there is no thermal excitation.

When the conditions that kl ≪ ku and cngk ≪ T ≪ cngku are satiﬁed, a further simpliﬁcation

of Eq. (31) can be made as

Γ2k ≈

35/2(1 + u)2(1 − u)

4 √2πu2k

cng fB(cngkl).

(33)

Equation (33) clearly shows that the damping rate is proportional to the Bose distribution function,
fB(cngkl), of the thermally excited NG modes with the lowest momentum kl that is allowed by the
conservation law.

In Fig. 5, we show the damping rate of the NG mode Γ2k/(J ¯nz) as a function of u for several
values of the temperature T and the initial momentum k. In addition to the results of the analytical
expression (31), we plot the data points obtained from numerical integration of Eq. (26) with
respect to k1 and k2 for comparison. In order to clarify eﬀects of the anisotropy of γk in the
momentum space, which are ignored in Eq. (26), we show the cases of the three diﬀerent directions,
namely k/k = (1, 0, 0), ( √3/2, 1/2, 0), and (1/ √3, 1/ √3, 1/ √3).

From Eq. (31) and Fig. 5, we see the following four generic tendencies. First, for given u and
k, the damping rate increases with increasing the temperature. This is very natural in the sense that
the number of thermally excited NG modes, which are a main source of the Landau damping, is
larger for a higher temperature. Second, the eﬀects of the anisotropy are more noticeable for larger
k, which is also natural. Third, the analytical results of Eq. (31) better agree with the numerical
data at a closer vicinity of the critical point, as expected from the validity condition (32). Fourth,
it is the most remarkable that the damping rate is signiﬁcantly large near the critical point and
monotonically decays into zero from its peak as |u − uc| increases.

Let us explain the fourth tendency from a viewpoint of the energy-momentum conservation law.
If the Higgs gap satisﬁes the condition that cngk ≃ ∆/2 near u = uc as illustrated in Fig. 6(a), the
lowest energy of the thermal NG mode that is absorbed by the initial NG mode is given by cngkl ≃
∆/2 as a result of the energy-momentum conservation law. This means that the Bose distribution
function in Eq. (33) can be fB(cngkl) = O(1) even at T < ∆ ∼ Tc. In other words, in this case there
are suﬃciently many thermal NG modes that the initial NG mode can absorb to attenuate. On the
other hand, if |u − uc| increases for ﬁxed T such that cngk ≪ ∆ [see Fig. 6(b)], the condition that
cngkl > ∆ is imposed by the energy-momentum conservation law. This implies that cngkl ≫ T , thus
leading to the exponential suppression of the damping rate.

In Fig. 7, we show the ratio Γ2k/(cngk) to characterize the behavior of the temporal oscillation
of the NG mode. As seen in Fig. 7(a), when k = 0.1 and T = 0.3J ¯nz, Γ2k/(cngk) exceeds unity near
the critical point, i.e., the NG mode is overdamped. Figure 7(b) shows that the damping rate can be

The solid lines represent the analytic results of Eq. (31) and the dots represent the numerical
evaluation of Eq. (26) without the long-wavelength approximation. The system size taken in the
numerical calculations is N = 5003. We set (T/(J ¯nz), k) = (0.1, 0.1) (a), (0.3, 0.3) (b), (0.1, 0.3) (c),
and (0.3, 0.3) (d). Notice that we do not show the region where T > ∆ ∼ Tc.

even larger by optimizing the wavelength of the initial NG mode k. One also sees from Fig. 7(b)
that the analytical expression (31) completely fails in the limit of k → 0, which is consistent with
the validity condition (32).

14

We ﬁnally note the limitation of the 1-loop approximation regarding the predictability of over-
damping of a collective mode. Because this approximation is a perturbative approach, Γmk > Emk,
which is the condition of the overdamping, means that the perturbative correction is larger than the
nonperturbative value. Therefore, one cannot judge whether or not the overdamping is an artifact
of the 1-loop approximation until the higher-order corrections are evaluated.

cases, we set N = 5003 for the numerical calculations.

6 Summary

In this paper, we studied the damping of the Higgs and the NG modes of Bose gases in a cubic
optical lattice at ﬁnite temperatures. We calculated the damping rates by using the eﬀective spin-1
model and the ﬁeld theoretical methods. We derived the analytic expressions of the damping rates
within the long-wavelength approximation and conﬁrmed their validity in the vicinity of the critical
point through the comparison with numerical calculations. We showed that while the Higgs mode
attenuates more signiﬁcantly at higher temperatures, it is not overdamped at temperatures that can
be achieved in typical experiments. This result indicates the feasibility of detecting the Higgs mode
at 3D and the ﬁnite temperatures as a resonance peak in a spectral function at least when there is no
trapping potential. As for the NG mode, we found parameter regions, where the Landau damping
process leads to the overdamping of the NG mode, and discussed the origin of the strong damping
especially near the critical point.

In the future studies, it will be important for addressing the detectability of the Higgs mode in
3D more quantitatively to include eﬀects of the trapping potential and the breaking of the particle-
hole symmetry. While a prescription to treat these eﬀects within the tree level has been presented

15

in Ref. [25], one needs to extend it to the 1-loop level to take into account the eﬀects of quantum
and thermal ﬂuctuations as well.
