We have studied the conformation and scaling behavior of a ﬂexible dendron (the primary branch of a
dendrimer) immersed in neutral or good solvents. A self-consistent ﬁeld theory combined with a pre-averaged
excluded volume potential representing the two-body short-ranged interaction between the monomers, was
adopted to calculate the density proﬁle of various generations and branch points thoroughly. Our calculation
results support the “dense-core” model. We ﬁnd the conformation of the dendron is strongly stretched in
the densed central region, but much weakly and uniformly stretched in the outer region where the monomer
density proﬁle is shoulder shaped. At good solvent limit, both our self-consistent ﬁeld theory calculation
and the Flory mean-ﬁeld theory calculation give the same scaling law R ∼ (GP )1/5N 2/5, where G is the
generation number of the dendron, P is the spacer monomer number, and N is the total monomer number.
If we ﬁx G, the scaling law is simpliﬁed to R ∼ P 3/5 in good solvent.

INTRODUCTION

TABLE I. Summary of scaling laws of dendrimer in solvents

Dendrimers are highly branched polymers synthesized
generation by generation regularly. Since ﬁrst prepared
in 1978 by Vogtle1, dendrimer has been extensively
studied both experimentally2–9 and theoretically10–27
over the past decades for its potential applications
in various areas,
including sensing, catalysis, molec-
ular electronics28, biomedicine28,29 and drug delivery
system30,31, etc.
In order to improve the performance
of dendrimer in diﬀerent areas, the physical property is
crucial. Especially, the physical property of dendrimers
in solutions attracts quite a lot of attentions, because
for many applications the dendrimers are immersed in a
solvent. However, due to the complex molecular struc-
ture and excluded volume eﬀect, the entire conforma-
tional property and scaling laws have not yet reached a
complete consensus.

(1) Density proﬁle: “hollow core” model and “dense-

core” model

An early study on the structure of dendrimers was
performed by de Gennes and Hervet10 in 1983. They
adopted a self-consistent ﬁeld theory based on the as-
sumption that “near the center the spacers may behave
like ﬂexible coils, but in the outer region they must be
elongated”10. Thus, the density proﬁle of the dendrimer
is minimum at the center and increases towards the edge.
This is known as the “hollow-core” model (or “dense-
packing” model). This model dominated the understand-
ing on dendrimer for two decades and stimulated a lot ap-
plication ideas28, because the model implies a molecular
capsule to packing functional drugs for delivery.

However,

in contrast to the “hollow-core”
model, Lescanec and Muthukumar11 reported a “dense-

core” model based on a computer simulation, in which
the density proﬁle of the dendrimer is maximum at the
center. After that, a great deal of works based on numer-
ical simulation and calculation methods, such as Monte
Carlo (MC) simulation12–14,18–20,23, molecular dynamics
(MD)15,22, Brownian dynamics (BD)17,21, self-consistent
ﬁeld theory (SCFT)16,24and density functional theory
(DFT)32, were published supporting the “dense-core”
model. The results of diﬀerent approaches agree on
several features of single dendrimer system. First, the
spacers of a small generation number are quite localized,
which contributes to a high density peak at the center of
dendrimer. Second, with increasing the generation num-
ber, a density emerges besides the center density peak,
which indicates the dendrimer transfers from a dilute one
to a dense one. The experiments of small-angle neutron
scattering (SANS), moreover, conﬁrm the “dense-core”
model4,6,33.

Although the “dense-core” model is widely accepted
nowadays, a local minimum valley between the center
peak and the plateau region in the density proﬁle, ﬁrst

discussed by Mansﬁeld and Klushin12, remains confus-
ing. This minimum is found in all simulations with strong
steric interactions when the generation number G is large
enough2,13,15,19,20, but can disappear when the solvent is
good11,23,34. The minimum is not found in SCFT cal-
culations where the volume interaction is replaced by a
mean-ﬁeld parameter16.

(2) Conformation: the back-folding phenomenon and

the terminal monomer distribution

According to the “hollow-core” model, surface conges-
tion occurs at the periphery of a dendrimer after a cer-
tain generation. The spacers are strongly stretched out-
wards, and consequently the free ends of the last gen-
eration distribute near the shell. However, the simu-
lation works supporting “dense-core” model found the
terminal monomer spread through the whole dendrimer
region12–15,20,23,34. This indicates the strong back-folding
tendency of the arms of the dendrimer. This phenomenon
is conﬁrmed by SANS experiments6.
(3) Scaling laws (with solvent)
The controversy over the scaling laws between the ra-
dius of gyration R and other topological parameters of
dendrimers, such as the monomer number N , the spacer
length P and the generation number G, never stops.

The theoretical approaches predict diﬀerent power
laws in diﬀerent models. In the “hollow-core” model, De
Gennes and Hervet10 reported R ∼ N 0.2 in good solvent
(athermal). In the “dense-core” model, via a mean-ﬁeld,
Flory-type free energy approach16,18,34, the scaling law is
R ∼ N 1/5(P G)2/5 in good solvent and R ∼ N 1/4(P G)1/4
in Θ solvent. In the poor solvent limit, the dendrimer is
a dense sphere, so that R ∼ N 1/3.
In computer simulations and experiments, the scaling
laws also do not agree with each other, as summarized
in Table I. A more detailed table summarizing diﬀerent
power law exponents in theoretical works and simulations
can be found in ref.23.

In order to solve the problems listed above, we per-
form SCFT to study the conformations and scaling
laws of a ﬂexible dendron thoroughly.
The SCFT
for dendrimer system, ﬁrst introduced by Boris and
Rubinstein16, adopts a pre-averaged potential to repre-
sent the two-body interaction between the monomers. In
Flory theory35, this potential is interpreted as the ef-
fect of volume exclusion between the monomers of linear
chains in a good solvent. Comparing with MD and MC
with full steric interaction, SCFT with the pre-averaged,
two-body interaction potential gives good expression of
the monomer density proﬁle and the power laws in good
solvents, although it is hard to approach the high density
limit where three-body interaction plays an important
role. Moreover, we study the dendron system instead
of a full dendrimer, because the “dendron”, deﬁned as
the branches at the ﬁrst level of branching15,28,36, is the
basic building block of dendrimer, and holds all physi-
cal properties including the conformation and the power
laws of dendrimer. Moreover, in the experiments with an
H-shaped core2,4–6, the dendrimers can be considered as

2

a dendron with the absence of the ﬁrst generation. The
ﬁrst generation of the dendron mainly contributes to the
localized center peak of density13,15,20 due to its topo-
logical position and small volume fraction. Last but not
least, dendron is attracting research attentions, such as
the segregation of dendrons brushes22.
Our paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. II we in-
troduce the dendron model and the self-consistent ﬁeld
theory with excluded volume potential, and discuss the
Flory theory for the dendron. In Sec. III, we focus on
the physical aspects (density proﬁle, folding-back con-
formation, stretching conformation and power laws) of
a dendrimer immersed in a good solvent via a detailed
analyzing of our simulation data. In the last section, we
summarize the main results and draw the conclusion.

II. THEORETICAL METHOD

A. The model

We consider a dendron, the branch at the ﬁrst level of
a dendrimer molecule15,28,36, immersed in a good solvent.
The dendron consists of G generations with the ﬁrst seg-
ment ﬁxed at the origin, as illustrated in Fig.1. We use
g to denote the generation number of the spacers. The
branch monomer, denoted with a number p, connects the
g-th and the (g + 1)-th spacer. The ﬁrst monomer and
the terminal monomers are denoted as p = 0 and p = G,
respectively. For simplicity, all the spacers, which are
assumed to be ﬂexible chains, have the same segment
number P . The total segment number is N = P (2G − 1).
We use the square root of the dendron’s mean square
center-end distance R of a single linear side chain (a
no-backward route from p = 0 to a terminal monomer
p = G) of GP monomers to characterize the overall ra-
dial size.

In the absence of excluded volume interactions, or in
other words, when the dendron is immersed in a Θ sol-
vent, the conformation entropy achieves the maximum
value with each linear side chain (a no-backward route
from p = 0 to one end monomer p = G) assuming Gaus-
sian conformation. Therefore, R0, the square root of the
mean square distance from the ﬁrst monomer p = 0 to a
terminal monomer p = G, is the same as the mean end-
to-end distance of a linear Gaussian chain with segment
number P G16,18

R0 = (P G)1/2a

(1)

where a is the segment Kuhn length. In Sec. III A, we
conﬁrm this power law by SCFT calculation.

B. Flory mean-ﬁeld theory

We consider the dendron immersed in a good solvent.
So that the dendron is not dense. At any spacial point,

3

the three-body interaction is insigniﬁcant.

Minimizing the free energy, we obtain a scaling law of

the equilibrium size in terms of N, P G and u,

R ∼ u1/5(P G)1/5N 2/5

(3)

where u is a phenomenological constant to describe the
solvent property. We drop u and simplify the power law
as R ∼ (P G)1/5N 2/5.

C. Self-consistent ﬁeld theory

SCFT was ﬁrst introduced by Edwards and developed
by Matsen37 and Fredrikson38 et.al.
It has been used
successfully to study the thermodynamic equilibrium of
polymers in its present form. However, the SCFT theory
usually does not include the excluded volume interaction,
which is absolutely important in dendrimer systems of
high generation. Therefore, we modiﬁed the theory by
including a pre-averaged ﬁeld ω = uφ into the Hamil-
tonian to approximate the excluded volume interaction,
where φ is the dimensionless local number density of the
segments39. The excluded volume of a single segment is
characterized40 by uν0 = (1 − 2χ)ν0, 0 ≤ χ ≤ 0.5, where
χ is the Flory-Huggins parameter between the segment
and solvent, and ν0 is the volume of a segment. So the
parameter u describes the overall eﬀect of the volume ex-
clusion of the segments and the swelling of the solvent.
At Θ point with u = 0, where a slight incompatibility of
solvent balances the excluded volume eﬀect of segments,
the property of dendron is similar to ideal Gaussian case.
As u increases, the size of the dendron expands due to
the excluded volume interaction.

The contour parameter of a linear side chain is labeled
as s from the initial segment s = 0 (p = 0) to one free
end s = 1 (p = G). We specify the conformation of the
dendron by a vector r(s) in three-dimensional space. For
a given conformation, the Hamiltonian of the system is
given by

number g = 1, g = 2, and g = 3, respectively. The circles
denote the branch monomers and the free end monomers, and
the numbers inside the circle are corresponding p values. In
our simulation, we only calculate a dendron molecule (the
sharp colored area), which is one-third of a dendrimer, in full
three-dimensional space.

we assume the local density of the monomer is low. The
conformation is determined by the balance between the
repulsive excluded volume interaction and the entropic
energy. Based on the idea of Flory free energy for a
single linear chain in good solvent35, the free energy of a
dendron is,

exactly, we therefore adopt the saddle point approxima-
tion which takes the most possible conﬁguration as the

The numerical calculation process is performed by ini-
tiating a complete random ﬁeld ω(r), solving the diﬀusion
equation Eqn. 12, calculating the dimensionless density
Eqn. 14, generating the new ﬁeld Eqn. 11, then iterating
from the diﬀusion equation again. Taking the advantage
of spherical symmetry of this model, we could reduce the
diﬀusion equation from three dimension into one dimen-

tance R2 from

(18)

In this paper, we choose the Kuhn length a and the seg-
ment volume ν0 as units.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we exhibit the SCFT calculation results
of dendron systems by systematically changing the pa-
rameters 2 ≤ g ≤ 10, 1 ≤ P ≤ 20, and 0 ≤ u ≤ 0.2. We
ﬁrst discuss the Gaussian dendron to verify the power law
of R0 as well as to prove the validity of our calculation.
Second, we analyze the density proﬁles of the dendron
with diﬀerent u to show the response of conformation
to the solvent property and the excluded volume eﬀect.
Third, we discuss the elongated conformation of spacers
of diﬀerent topological positions. At last, we compare the
scaling laws obtained from SCFT and Flory mean-ﬁeld
theory.

A.

Ideal Gaussian dendron

The ideal Gaussian dendron with u = 0 is the sim-
plest case that the segments are “ghost” segments and
do not interact via volume exclusion. A linear side chain
of length P G behaves as an ideal linear chain, because
the conformation of the branches has no inﬂuence to it.
Therefore, the center-end distance R0 obeys the power
law in Eqn. 1, and the end monomer distribution Ψ(r)
can be obtained analytically,

Ψ(r) =(cid:18) 3

2P Ga2(cid:19)

3
2

exp(cid:26)−

3r2

2P Ga2(cid:27)

(19)

As shown in Fig. 2(a), our results reproduce the power
law in Eqn. 1 very well within an error less than 1%,
which we attribute to the accuracy of spacial discretiza-
tion in the calculation. And Ψ(r) obtained in the cal-
culation overlaps the theoretical result Eqn. 19 totally in
Fig. 2(b). Therefore, we believe that our SCFT approach
is appropriate for the dendron system.

B. Density proﬁle of dendron

The segment density of a single dendrimer attracts
quite a lot of theoretical as well as experimental re-
search interest, because it reﬂects the conformation of

the molecule. We can design the function of a dendrimer
if we have accurate knowledge of the spacial position of
each monomer.

We analyze the total segment number density of
the dendron of generation G, ρG(r), which obeys

R drρG(r)4πr2 = N , as shown in Fig. 3 . Obviously, the

monotonically decreasing density proﬁle with the high-
est density at r = 0 supports the “dense-core” model11.
With increasing u, the shape of ρG(r) transfers from the
fast decreasing mode of u = 0, to a typical “dense-core”
model density proﬁle with a center peak and a plateau
region13–15,19,20,34.

Comparing with the system in a Θ solvent(u = 0.0),
ρG(r) exhibits an obvious penetration of segments into
the solvent even though u only slightly increases to 0.001.
For ρG(r) with u ≥ 0.01, a “shoulder” of very slow de-
creasing rate emerges. The region size of the shoulder in-
creases with u, reﬂects stronger extension of the dendron
with increasing excluded volume eﬀect (or in other words,
the swelling behavior of the dendron in good solvent).
The emergence of the “shoulder” agrees the result of MD
and MC simulations with full volume exclusion13–15,19,20,

as well as the previous MF theory calculations with pre-
averaged volume exclusion eﬀect34.

However, the local minimum value between the center
peak and the shoulder region never appears in our SCFT
calculation. Note that this phenomenon disappears when
the solvent is good11,23,34. Moreover, the minimum is also
not found in self-consist mean-ﬁeld theory calculations16,
where the volume interaction energy only keeps two-body
interaction term and neglects higher orders. Therefore,
we attribute the arising of the local density minimum to
the innegligible three-body interactions of volume exclu-
sion, which means the dense dendron beyond our low-
density assumption.

In order to clarify the distribution of diﬀerent genera-
tions to the total density proﬁle, we analyze the segment
number density ρg(r) of g-th generation spacers, which

obeys R drρg(r)4πr2 = 2g−1P . As shown in Fig.4(a),

the density peak near the center is mostly contributed
by the ﬁrst generation g = 1, while the other generations
consist the shoulder after the sharp peak at the center.
In Fig.4(a), when the generations g ≥ 4, the monomers
in higher generations comprise the ones in lower genera-
tions. This is identical to the result obtained by Murat
and Grest15. The position of the peak moves outwards
with increasing g except the last generation due to the
free terminal monomer. Also, any changes of the dendron
parameters which will increase the excluded volume en-
ergy, i.e. the increasing of u (Fig. 4(b)) and the increas-
ing of the generation number G of dendron (Fig. 5), will
move the ρg(r) to larger r.

Although ρg(r) of diﬀerent g spreads more outwards
with increasing generation number, it always has non-
vanishing value at the center. Particularly, the outmost
generation gg=6(r) distributes over the whole dendron
region (Fig.4(b)). The non-vanishing value of ρg≥2 indi-
cate a strong back-folding conformation, a phenomenon
we will discuss in detail in next section.

C. The stretched conformation

The equilibrium conformation of a dendron in good sol-
vent is determined by the compromise between entropic
energy and volume exclusion energy. The conformation
of the ﬂexible spacer stretches to suppress the local seg-
ment density, so as to decrease the two-body interaction
energy in the cost of increasing entropic energy due to
the deviation from an ideal Gaussian chain. The constric-
tion force arising from entropy countervails the stretching
force arising from volume exclusion. Certainly, the de-
gree of stretching depends on the topological position as
well as the spacial position of a spacer.

In order to analyze the stretching of the spacers, we cal-
culate the distribution of their ends and the the branch
points. According to the initial condition of the diﬀusion
equation Eqn. 13, the density function of the ﬁrst seg-
ment ρp=0(r) is the Dirac delta function at origin r = 0.
As shown in Fig. 6(a), the density distribution of the
branch points ρp(r) expends wider with larger p value.
This is a straight forward result of increasing side chain
length pP . For ideal chain with u = 0, the distribu-

FIG. 5. The segment number density ρg(r) of g = 2 of P =
5 dendrons with u = 0.1. The generation number of the
dendron varys from G = 2 to G = 6.

tion of p-th branch monomer is a Gaussian distribution
with the expectation at r = 0 and the width (pP )1/2a,
as shown in Eqn. 19. However, when u 6= 0, the peak
position obviously increases with p, which indicates the
stretched conformation of the spacers. The higher value
of the volume exclusion interaction parameter u is, the
position of the ρp(r) peak moves outwards further, as
shown in Fig. 6(b), which veriﬁes the essential inﬂuence
of volume exclusion on stretching conformation directly.
If we increase the generation number of the dendron,
which increases the average segment density, the stronger
stretching also moves the ρp(r) peak further away from
the center, as shown in Fig. 6(c).

A nontrivial phenomenon to mention is that the branch
point density ρp(r) never vanishes at r = 0, the center of
dendron. This is an important evidence for the back-
folding conformation. The back-folding phenomenon
was reported in previous experimental6 and theoretical
works2,18,19,23,34. We ﬁnd that even the penetration of
good solvents and the excluded volume eﬀect drive the
dendron to stretch outwards extensively, the back-folding
of the conformation persists. ρp(r) decreases with in-
creasing p with the exception of p = G, as shown in
Fig. 6(a). The terminal p = G segments are free ends
which have stronger ability to fold back than the neigh-
bor branch monomer p = G−1. Nevertheless, the density
of the terminal segment at center decreases with increas-
ing u and G and approaches vanishing (Fig. 6(b,c)). This
indicates the possibility to drive the terminal segments
away from the center region of dendron with suﬃcient
interaction.

In order to analyze the stretching conformation of the
linear side chain directly, we calculate the mean square
distance between the ﬁrst monomer p = 0 and the p-
th branch point, denoted as Rp. Rp, normalized by the
mean end-to-end distance (pP )1/2 of a Gaussian dendron,
is drawn as a function of p, as shown in Fig. 7(a). Inter-

FIG. 7. (a) The mean distance Rp between the ﬁrst segment and the p-th branch point of a G = 7 dendron. (b) The end-to-end
distance Rg of the g-th generation spacer of the dendrons as same as in (a).

estingly, Rp(pP )−1/2 increases linearly with p near the
dendron center, while decreases smoothly after a peak
near p = 4, 5 when G = 7 and u ∼ 10−2. Such a
non-monotonic behavior indicates the non-uniform vol-
ume exclusion environment inside the dendron.

We also analyze the end-to-end distance of the g-th
generation spacer between the branch points p = g − 1
and p = g, denoted as Rg. As shown in Fig. 7(b), Rg
decreases monotonously as g increases. The spacer of
the ﬁrst generation stretches so strong that Rg is about
30% larger than Gaussian chain of length P , although
the value of u is a very ﬁnite number of 10−2. After sev-
eral generations (in Fig. 7(b), about g = 4), Rg converges
to a constant value slightly larger than √P . Combining
the information from Figs. 7(a) and (b), we conclude that
the stretching behavior is inhomogeneous along the linear
side chain. The spacer of the ﬁrst generation stretches
most strongly, because it is localized at the center of the
molecule, where the volume exclusion is not only con-
tributed by itself, but also by other spacers penetrating
into the center region via the back-folding conformation.
The other spacers of small g (e.g. g = 2 and g = 3 spac-
ers in Fig. 7) are strongly inﬂuenced by the densed re-
gion near the center. Thus the degree of their stretching

depends on the topological distance to the center. The
larger g value is, the weaker the spacer stretches. For
the spacers of large g (e.g. g ≥ 5 in Fig. 7), who mainly
contributes to the shoulder region of the total monomer
density (Fig. 4(a)), the homogeneous extension of the
chains implies the irrelavance of topological position to
the chain conformation. Therefore, our SCFT calculation
with the pre-averaged volume exclusion gives the confor-
mation information of a dendron: near the center region,
the chains are elongated, while in the outer region, the
spacers behave like ﬂexible chains. This is just the oppo-
site side of the assumption of ”hollow-core” model10.

Note that Rp and Rg are analyzed in radial direction
in the sphere coordination. Therefore, we only discuss
the radial stretching of the dendron conformation, while
the deformation of the conformation in longitude and lat-
itude directions are not of focus here.

D. Scaling law analysis

Via the Flory mean-ﬁeld theory approach, we obtain
the scaling relation R ∼ u1/5(P G)1/5N 2/5, as shown in
Eqn. 3. Since N is proportional to P , R ∼ P 3/5 when

data shown here.

G is ﬁxed. This agrees with pioneer researches on the
scaling law for good solvent15,18.

We use the G = 4 dendron as an example to show the
scaling relation between R and P , as shown in Fig. 8.
The solvent parameter starts from the Θ solvent (u = 0),
and increases to approaching the good solvent limit u =
0.5. With each u value, we analyze the scaling behavior
R ∼ P β and plot the exponent β as a function of u. β
starts from 0.5 at u = 0, which agrees with the ideal
Gaussian dendron limit. With increasing u, β increases
and converges to a limit value β = 0.58 ± 0.02, which
is very close to our MF theory prediction R ∼ P 3/5.
Moreover, Fig. 8 indicates that only when u is suﬃciently
large (u ≥ 0.1), the behavior of the dendron obeys the
good solvent scaling laws.
scaling relation R ∼
u1/5(GP )1/5N 2/5. We only consider the dendron systems
obeying the good solvent scaling laws, i.e. u = 0.1 and
u = 0.2. As shown in Fig. 9, a linear function describes

Then, we analyze

the

very well the relation between R and u1/5(GP )1/5N 2/5,
no matter how we change G or P and consequently
change N . This validates our scaling law obtained via
Flory mean-ﬁeld theory approach. Therefore, suggested
by the Flory mean-ﬁeld theory calculation and supported
by our SCFT results, we verify the scaling law relation
R ∼ (GP )1/5N 2/5 in the good solvent limit.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we investigate the conformational behav-
ior and scaling laws of dendrons immersed in a good sol-
vent by using Flory mean-ﬁeld theory and SCFT method.
Our SCFT approach takes into account the excluded vol-
ume eﬀect by using a pre-averaged potential describing
the two-body interaction between monomers. We con-
ﬁrm the ”dense-core” model of dendrons, accompanied
by a persistent backfolding conformation, which never
disappears with changing volume exclusion eﬀect or sol-
vent property. However, suﬃciently strong volume ex-
clusion depresses the density of the terminal monomers
near the center, which provides the potential usage in
drug delivery system. By analyzing the end-to-end dis-
tance of spacers of diﬀerent generations, we ﬁnd that dif-
ferent parts of a linear side chain of a dendron are under
diﬀerent stretching conditions. Near the center of the
dendron, the spacers are stretched strongly due to the
volume exclusion eﬀect of densed, localized monomers
at the center. The stretching eﬀect fades quickly with
increasing the generation number of the spacer, and ap-
proaches to a limit number. Therefore, for the spacers
with large generation numbers, which are far from the
center and mainly contribute to the shoulder region of the
total monomer density, the stretching is relatively weak
and homogeneous. Last but not least, our SCFT results
support very well our scaling calculation via the Flory
mean-ﬁeld theory approach. At good solvent limit, we
ﬁnd the dendron size R is proportional to (GP )1/5N 2/5.
If we ﬁx G, the scaling law is simpliﬁed as R ∼ P 3/5,
because N is proportional to P .

Although we have only calculated the conformation
of a dendron molecule, which is the primary branch of
a dendrimer, our conclusions can be directly applied to
dendrimers. A dendron can be considered as a dendrimer
of H-shaped core with a small spacer suspended at the
center. Comparing with the huge molecule, the suspen-
sion chain only enhances the central density peak, and is
impossible to strongly inﬂuence the other properties such
as the scaling behavior and the stretching conformation.
Our future study interest is on the systems of conﬁned
dendron with interactions between spacers. The com-
plex morphology is the balance of competition between
the entropic depression of spacial conﬁnement, the inter-
facial energy and the strong volume exclusion eﬀect of
the highly fractal conﬁguration.
