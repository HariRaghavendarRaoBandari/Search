Abstract

In this paper we compute the regularized vacuum energy associated with vectorial perturbations

of the SU(2) massless Yang-Mills ﬁeld. We regard Dirichlet and twisted boundary conditions

in a chromomagnetic background, at zero temperature. Then, we analyse the behaviour of the

Casimir energy in the weak and strong coupling regimens, and compare with similar results

obtained for the scalar and spinorial ﬁelds in a magnetic ﬁeld background. In the weak coupling

scenario, we show that it is necessary to introduce mass in the perturbations in order to make

manifest the eﬀects due to the chromomagnetic ﬁeld. Otherwise, in the strong coupling regimen,

we evaluate the eﬀects of the mass as well as of a compact extra dimension on the stabilization of

the regularized vacuum energy.

INTRODUCTION

It is known since the late 1970s that the so-called Abelian solutions of the Yang-Mills

(Y-M) theory are unstable [1–4], i.e., there are modes for these ﬁelds associated to the

exponential growth of inﬁnitesimal perturbations in the strong coupling regimen. Such

Abelian solutions represent a gauge choice for the potentials which leave the ﬁeld strength

unidirectional in the internal space of the group as well as in the ordinary space and can be

used in order to investigate the vacuum instability of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) [5].

These ﬁelds keep a close relationship with an electric or magnetic ﬁeld, and for this reason

they are called chromoelectric or chromomagnetic ﬁeld. The motivations to study such ﬁelds

are many, such as the analysis of their behaviour in nontrivial topologies which stabilize them

[6] and of models in which they are seeds for the observed large scale (intergalactic) magnetic

ﬁelds, this time stabilized by the prevailing conditions of the primordial Universe [7–9].

Nielsen and Olesen [2] also studied the referred instability as well as its eﬀects on asymp-

totic freedom and on vacuum polarization, ﬁnding the energies of the perturbation modes

of the SU(2) Yang-Mills (YM) ﬁelds in a chromomagnetic background. These authors have

shown that at least one mode is unstable since the energy eigenvalue becomes imaginary.

Other studies, like the previous, also indicate that the QCD vacuum is a very complicated

system [10] (see also references therein), meaning that at short distances, below the QCD

scale, it presents a nontrivial topological structure, in which may occur states describing a

kind of condensed particle, as a superconductor, with energy level below the one associated

to states without particles [11].

Another phenomenon concerning to the richness and complexity of the vacuum is the

Casimir eﬀect, which represents the manifestation of the basic physical reality named quan-

tum vacuum. It has been exhaustively studied after H. Casimir theoretically has predicted

the phenomenon [12], investigating the attractive force that arises between two parallel,

inﬁnite, and uncharged metallic plates placed in the perfect vacuum at zero temperature.

This force is caused essentially by the shift in the electromagnetic zero point energy due

to the presence of the boundaries. The theoretical and experimental studies related to the

phenomenon have grown since then, covering a wide range of geometrical conﬁgurations,

boundaries made by a variety of materials, quantum ﬁelds of diﬀerent spins [13].

In particular, the analysis of the Casimir eﬀect in nontrivial topologies has been made in

2

several contexts from Cosmology [14–17], including universes with compact extra dimensions

[18, 19], up to condensed matter [20–23]. In the context of alternative theories of gravity,

the phenomenon was studied in [24, 25], and in the General Relativity, by linearizing the

ﬁeld equations and considering real parallel plates. Recently, the eﬀect was considered as a

possible phenomenon which can be used to detect gravitons [26].

The complexity of the QCD vacuum has been little explored in the Casimir eﬀect subject.

The works on this context practically covers only the bag model for the nucleon structure [18].

Therefore, there is a gap in which concerns this subject and for that reason it is necessary

to study the Casimir eﬀect in the realm of the QCD vacuum.

In the present paper we

intend to contribute in that derection, and in order to do this we will calculate the vacuum

energy of vectorial perturbations of the massless SU(2) Y-M ﬁelds in a chromomagnetic

background ﬁeld and in the conﬁguration of the colorless parallel plates, under Dirichlet

and twisted boundary conditions (b.c.). The technic used consist of summing half of the

eigenfrequencies, using the results obtained in [2] by solving the linearized equations of

motion, and regularizing it by the zeta function approach. We also analyse the behaviour

of the Casimir energy in both the weak and strong coupling regimens. In the ﬁrst case, we

will show that it is necessary to introduce a massive ﬁeld in the perturbations and in the

second one we will evaluate the eﬀects of the mass as well as of a compact extra dimension

on the stabilization of the Casimir vacuum.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we present the general expression for the

regularized vacuum energy and discuss the considered regimens. In section 3 we discuss the

results and present some remarks.

2. QUANTUM VACUUM ENERGY OF Y-M FLUCTUATIONS IN AN UNIFORM

CHROMOMAGNETIC FIELD

In this section, we present the general calculations of the regularized vacuum energy of

the quantum ﬂuctuations fµ(x, t) of a Y-M ﬁeld in a static and uniform chromomagnetic

background. The approach consists of summing over half of frequencies, since the equation

of motion for these ﬂuctuations contains a harmonic oscillator potential [4].

The vectorial perturbations of a massless Abelian Y-M ﬁeld have eigenfrequencies given

−fµ(x, y, z + a, t), respectively [18]. This latter is quite used in the bag model of nucle-
ons, hence our interest in studying it in the present context. Here k, n = 0, 1, 2, 3... and
ǫ = −1, 1, since the perturbation is due to a massless spin one particle. The plates have
area L2 and are separated by a distance a.

Considering initially the Dirichlet b.c., the vacuum energy ω(0) will be the half of the sum

Firstly, we will study the regimen which corresponds to perturbations in a uniform weak

chromomagnetic ﬁeld, as well as weak coupling and short distance between the plates. In this

regimen, the stability of the Yang-Mills ﬁelds is assured. Doing the asymptotic expansions

of the Hurwitz zeta functions as follows

result of the Casimir energy of a massless scalar ﬁeld. In order to see the eﬀects due to both

the coupling and the ﬁeld in this level of approximation, it is necessary to take into account

the modes with ǫ = 0. In other words, the perturbations should acquire mass [2], which

we will consider negligible here, but whose eﬀects on the spin are considered. Thus, let us

add to the Eq. (4) the term P∞k=1 ζH (−1/2, x), so that in the investigated limit we have
ζH (−1/2, x) ≈ − 2

2√x, which yields a regularized vacuum energy

where ζ(−1) = −1/12. Notice the character also attractive of the force associated to the
correction due to both the coupling constant and chromomagnetic ﬁeld.

From Eq.(2), the regularized vacuum energy under twisted b.c. can be simply obtained

by making a → a/2 and ζ(n) → ζH(n, 1/2) in the above expression, which result in

The force has now a repulsive nature, even in the situation in which we do not take into

account the mass of the Y.M. ﬁeld perturbations.

Now we will work in the opposite regimen, i.e., when gBa2 ≫ 1, in which the instabilities
of the Y-M ﬁelds are manifest. The procedure to regularize the vacuum energy will be

something diﬀerent from that one employed so far. Now, we consider the identity

(16)

Regarding ˜ζ1(s), we arrive at a non-convergent integral, since it contains an element

of instability in the Y-M ﬁelds - recall that the eigenfrequencies with n = 0 and ǫ = 1

become imaginary in the regimen under consideration. Thus, by subtracting the term n = 0

from P exp [−(2n − 1)√gBat] we have that ˜ζ1(s) vanishes. Thus, the stable part of the

regularized vacuum energy is, therefore

This stable contribution to the vacuum energy is responsible for an attractive force between

the plates, which is very weak, tending to zero in the limit of very strong ﬁelds. With respect

to twisted b.c., the results above are the same, unless numerical factors, and the signal of

the force does not change. The unstable part remains for ǫ = 1. It is worth noticing that the

expression for the regularized vacuum is slightly diﬀerent for a charged and massless scalar

particle in a magnetic ﬁeld, including just also other numerical factors.

Now, let us evaluate the inﬂuence of the mass of the ﬂuctuations on the system, adding
m2 to Eq.(1), which will yield a factor exp (−m2t) in the integrals of Eqs. (11) and (12).
Then this latter will converge provided m ≥ √gB, which means that a large value for the

mass contributes to stabilization of the Casimir energy, in the regimen under consideration.

We must also consider the spin term ǫ = 0 due to this mass, and a third zeta function given

by

Regarding the twisted b.c., one can show that modiﬁcations occur only in the numerical

factors, such that the analytical results are the same.

The feature of the inclusion of a large mass in the Y-M ﬂuctuations as an element of

their stabilization is similar to the problem of consider the existence of a compact extra

dimension `a la Kaluza-Klein with topology S1 in the strong coupling/ﬁeld regime. To the

eigenfrequencies (1) we should add the term ℓ2/R2, where ℓ = 0, 1, 2... and R is the radius

of the extra dimension. In this way, with R2 ≪ a/√gB, we arrive at
ω(0)

Thus, the compact extra dimension would stabilize the regularized quantum vacuum of the
Y-M ﬂuctuations below a critical radius, Rc ≈ (gB)−1/2.

3. CONCLUSIONS AND REMARKS

We have computed the regularized vacuum energy of SU(2) Y-M quantum perturbations

in an uniform chromomagnetic background ﬁeld in the conﬁguration of the idealized un-

charged and colorless parallel plates, using Dirichlet and twisted boundary conditions, at

7

zero temperature. We analysed its behaviour in both the regimens of weak and strong cou-

pling/ﬁeld using the technique of the zeta function regularization. In the ﬁrst case, taking

into account Dirichlet b.c., in which the system is free of Nielsen-Olesen instabilities, we

initially have analysed Y-M massless perturbations, obtaining a Casimir energy that is triv-

ially identical to that one of a massless scalar ﬁeld without a background ﬁeld. Then the

need of evaluating the eﬀects of both the coupling and chromomagnetic ﬁeld in the weak

approximation obliged us to consider Y-M ﬂuctuations with negligible mass, which resulted

in a correction to the Casimir energy proportional to a−1, amplifying the attractive force

previously found. On the other hand, we found that the twisted b.c. changes the signal of

the obtained forces, as well as the numerical factors. It is interesting to point out that under

both conditions such a dependence on a is related to a system with one spatial dimension
because in general ω(0)

reg ∝ a−d [27]. We believe that this aspect is typical of the quantum

vacuum associated to the Y-M ﬂuctuations, since that it is possible to show that the mas-

sive scalar particle or a spinorial one in an ordinary magnetic ﬁeld does not exhibit such a

feature.

Next, we have investigated the strong coupling or background ﬁeld scale, in which the

Nielsen-Olesen instabilities are unavoidable. As expected, we found a divergent part in

the Casimir energy and the stable contribution expressed through Eq. (17) can be once

more compared with the cases of a massless charged scalar particle or a spinorial one under

inﬂuence of an ordinary constant magnetic ﬁeld in this regimen [28]. In this case the Casimir

energies diﬀer from those ones of Y-M perturbations in a chromomagnetic ﬁeld just by

numerical factors. The twisted b.c. yields the same result, except by the numerical factors,

too.

We also have shown that a very large mass associated to the ﬂuctuations stabilizes the

quantum vacuum, and this is similar to consider the simplest form of a compact extra
dimension (i.e., the space having topology M 4 × S1 and radius R) in the stabilization of
this energy, and in fact it occurs provided that √gBR 6 1. This permit us to conclude
that, at zero temperature, a possible mechanism to stabilize the quantum vacuum of Y-M

perturbations would be the existence of these extra dimensions. Such a stabilization of

SU(2) Y-M vacuum energy was already studied in context of other topologies, as on the

torus [6]. As future perspective for the present work, we propose to study eﬀects of more

general compact extra dimensions as well as of the temperature on this stabilization.
