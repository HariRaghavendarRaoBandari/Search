Abstract Particle-hole instabilities are studied within
a two dimensional model of fermions interacting with
antiferromagnetic spin ﬂuctuations (spin-fermion model).
In contrast to previous works, we assume that neigh-
boring hot spots overlap due to a shallow dispersion of
the electron spectrum in the antinodal region and in-
clude in the consideration eﬀects of a remnant low en-
ergy and momentum Coulomb interaction. It turns out
that this modiﬁcation of the model drastically changes
the behavior of the system. The leading particle-hole
instability at not very weak fermion-fermion interac-
tion is no longer a charge density wave with a modula-
tion along the diagonals of the Brillouin zone predicted
previously but a Pomeranchuk-type deformation of the
Fermi surface breaking the C4 symmetry of the system.
This order does not prevent from further phase transi-
tions at lower temperatures. We show that, depending
on parameters of the interaction, either d-wave super-
conductivity or charge density wave with modulations
along the bonds of the CuO lattice is possible. The low
momentum remnant Coulomb interaction enhances the
d-form factor of the charge density wave. Comparison
with experimental data allows us to conclude that in
many cuprate compounds the conditions for the pro-
posed scenario are indeed fulﬁlled. Our results may ex-

1 Introduction

Recent discovery of charge density waves (CDW) in
hole-doped cuprates has raised a new wave of inter-
est to the physics of these materials. The CDWs have
been detected in underdoped samples of YBCO [1,2,
3,4,5,6], Bi-2201 [7,8], Bi-2212 [9,11,12] and Hg-1201
[13,14] by direct methods such as resonant X-ray scat-
tering, hard X-ray diﬀraction and scanning tunneling
microscopy(STM). A wide variety of techniques, that
can be sensitive to a CDW indirectly, also conﬁrm its
presence, among them transport measurements [15,16],
nuclear magnetic resonance [21], ultrasound propaga-
tion [22] and pump-probe experiments [23].

Several common properties of this CDW state in
hole-doped cuprates have been identiﬁed. The transi-
tion temperature TCDW is higher than Tc but lower
or equal to the pseudogap temperature T ∗. The tem-
perature and magnetic ﬁled dependence of the CDW
amplitude(e.g. [5]) is consistent with the CDW state
competing with the superconductivity.

The CDW wave vectors seen in the experiments [3,
5,14,10] are directed along the Cu − O − Cu bonds
of the CuO2 plane (axes of the Brillouin zone, axial
CDW). The CDW period is approximately equal along
both the axes and increases with doping [5,7,9].

Recent studies have also revealed important infor-
mation about the distribution of the modulated charge

2

inside the unit cell, i.e. the CDW form factor. It has
been found for Bi-2212 [11] and YBCO [3] that the
charge is modulated approximately in antiphase at two
oxygen sites of the unit cell with the charge at Cu site
being constant. In other words, the CDW form factor is
characterized by a dominant d- component. The prop-
erties mentioned up to now are quite diﬀerent from the
stripe state of the La-based compounds [24,4].

Considerable attention has been also drawn to the
nanoscale structure of the CDW. Quantum resistance
oscillation experiments [17,18,19] have been interpreted
[20] as being due to a checkerboard modulation, where
CDWs with two orientations uniformly coexist through-
out the sample. Results of studies [10,2] suggest, how-
ever, show that the charge ordered state consists of do-
mains where CDW is unidirectional.

There have been a number of attempts to obtain the
CDW state with the properties discussed above from
microscopic calculations. In a model of fermions inter-
acting with antiferromagnetic critical spin ﬂuctuations
[25] (spin fermion (SF) model) a charge order appears
in perturbation theory as a subleading instability [26]
hindered by the curvature of the Fermi surface. This
order is a checkerboard CDW with d-form factor and
wave vectors directed along the diagonals of the BZ [27,
28]. The nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction can, in
principle, make this state leading as has been shown in
Ref. [29]. Moreover, thermal ﬂuctuations between this
charge order and SC have been shown to be able to de-
stroy both the orders while pertaining a single-particle
gap [27], which can explain the pseudogap phase. Qual-
itative aspects of CDW-SC competition are also well-
captured in the SF model: moderate magnetic ﬁelds
suppressing the superconductivity have been shown to
favor CDW [30] resembling the experiment [22]. The
vortex cores in the SC state have been shown to con-
tain CDW [31] which is seen in STM [32,33]. The diago-
nal direction of modulation wavevectors contrasting the
experiments, however, has proved to be quite robust.

Some proposals have been put forward to overcome
this contradiction. A CDW with the correct wavevector
direction has been obtained in Refs. [34,35], however
the form factor has been found to lack the dominant
d-symmetry with a large s- component. In Ref. [36] a
mixture of the states proposed in Ref. [27] and Ref.
[35] has been considered, which should contain either
the diagonal modulation or an axial CDW with a non
d-form factor. CDW considerations using other mod-
els [37,38,39,40,41,42,43]also do not seem to explain
the robustness of the axial d-form factor CDW in the
cuprates.

In this contribution we review the treatment of the
SF model allowing the neighboring hot spots to overlap,

nected by the antiferromagnetic wavevector (π, π)

such that eight hot spots merge into two hot regions
entirely covering the antinodal portions of the Fermi
surface. This corresponds to suﬃciently small values
|ε(π, 0) − EF | . Γ , where EF is the Fermi energy,
ε (π, 0) is the energy in the middle of the Brillouin zone
edge, and Γ is a characteristic energy of the fermion-
fermion interaction due to the antiferromagnetic ﬂuc-
tuations. Consideration of this limit is motivated by
ARPES data [44,45,46,47] showing that the energy sep-
aration between the hot spots and (π, 0); (0, π) is actu-
ally quite small. In addition to the electron-electron in-
teraction via paramagnons, we consider also the eﬀects
of low-energy (low-momentum) part of the Coulomb in-
teraction, which should not contradict the philosophy
of the low energy SF model. A detailed derivation and
discussion of the results can be found in our paper [48].

2 Model and main equations

We consider a single band of fermions interacting through
critical antiferromagnetic (AF) ﬂuctuations (paramagnons)
represented by a spinful bosonic ﬁeld as well as the
Coulomb force. As the AF ﬂuctuations peak at momen-
tum transfer (π, π) we restrict our model to two regions
of the Fermi surface connected with this vector repre-
sented in Fig. 1. Inside these regions we do not specify
individual hot spots, i.e. points on the FS connected
by (π, π) as we assume the interaction to be impor-
tant in all the whole region. This assumption is sup-
ported by ARPES experiments [44,45,46,47] showing
that |ε(π, 0) − EF | is actually smaller than the pseudo-
gap energy, which can be taken as the interaction scale.

The nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction has been

lows one to consider the particle-hole channel of the
model separately from the particle-particle one.

As both the regions we consider yield approximately
cos(kxa0) + cos(kya0) ≈ 0 we have δnOx(r) + δnOy (r) ≈
0 in or model, i.e. charge is modulated in antiphase at
the two oxygen sites of the unit cell.

Now we can discuss the qualitative eﬀects of the
Coulomb interaction in the CuO2 plane. The strong on-
site repulsion prohibits any real charge modulations on
the Cu sites leading to the constraint: δnCu = 0 for the
order parameter. Together with δnOx(r) + δnOy (r) ≈ 0
discussed above this leads to the conclusion that the
charge modulations obtained in our model will have the
d-form factor in accord with the experiments [11,3].

3 Pomeranchuk instability and intra-cell charge
modulation.

Our main ﬁnding is that for suﬃciently small µ the
leading particle-hole instability is the one with Q = 0.
The ordered state is then characterized not by a CDW,
but rather a deformation of the FS (this type of tran-
sition is known as Pomeranchuk instability [49], [50]).
Moreover, it follows from (4) that such a deformation
leads to a redistribution of charge between the oxygen
sites of the unit cell (see Fig.2).

One can obtain this result analytically for a simpli-
ﬁed BCS-like model where the paramagnon propagator
is replaced by a constant. For that case a mean-ﬁeld
analysis yields that if µ/TP om ≤ 1.1 then it is the lead-
4π2 (cid:1)2
2α (cid:0) λ0Λ
ing instability. TP om is given in this case by 1
where λ0 is the dimensionless coupling constant and Λ
is the size of a single region in the momentum space.
This expression contrasts the usual exponential depen-
dence obtained in BCS-like theories. A detailed account
on this simpliﬁed case is presented in [48].

Now let us turn to the model presented here. As a
starting approximation we will use the self-consistent
equations represented by diagrams in Fig. 3 The inte-
gral over momentum in the fermionic self-energy can
be greatly simpliﬁed provided µv2
s /α ≪ (vs/ξ)2, i.e.
that the correlation length is not too large. Then the
self-energy and polarization operator do not depend on
the momentum. To analyze the FS deformation we dis-
tinguish the ’even’ (Σ1 + Σ2)/2 ≡ iεn − if (εn) and
’odd’ (Σ1 − Σ2)/2 ≡ P contributions to self-energy,

like approximation given by Fig. 3. We shall not neglect,
however, the polarization operator, as it behaves lin-
early at low frequencies and might outpower the initial
quadratic dispersion.

One can clearly see that for ¯µ less than a certain
value Pomeranchuk instability is the leading one. Note
that the ratio µ/TP om can be as high as 12 for pv2
0.5 and 9 for pv2
As the Fermi Surface seen in ARPES experiments
is universally found to be C4-symmetric and in the
light of the domained CDW structure [12,2], we assume
that Pomeranchuk order should also be organized in do-
mains with diﬀerent sign of the order parameter. This
constitutes a way of ’masking’ a C4 breaking alternative
to the one proposed in [51].

The equations (5) have been numerically solved by
an iteration scheme, yielding the transition temperature
TP om where the ’odd’ self-energy P becomes non-zero.
To show that this transition can be indeed leading we
have also computed the transition temperature for a
CDW with wavevector along the BZ diagonal. This in-
stability has been found to be universally leading in pre-
vious studies. The transition temperature can be found
from the linearized equation for the CDW order param-
eter Wdiag(εn):

4 Incommensurate charge modulation.

The deformed Fermi surface of Fig.2 can be unstable
to CDW formation at lower temperatures. The direc-
tion and the magnitude of the wavevector are directly
related to the sign and the magnitude of P . We assume
that the CDW wavevector should yield nesting in the
region where the FS ’expands’ due to the FS deforma-
tion. Then one has:

In our model the FS in the second region ’closes’ moving
out of the considered region for P > µ. However, as is
seen from Fig.2, in reality such a deformation can lead
to emergent nesting in this region with the same vector

that the nesting vectors in both regions coincide also in

5 Comparison with experiments and
conclusions.

Motivated by the existing ARPES data [44,45,46] we
have considered the SF model with overlapping hotspots
and demonstrated that the d-wave Fermi surface dis-
tortion can be the leading instability. The transition is
further followed at a lower temperature by a transition
into a state with a d-form factor CDW directed along
one of the BZ axes. The corresponding transition tem-
peratures TP om and TCDW can be not far away from
each other.

The results obtained allow us to draw the following

qualitative picture of the charge order formation:

• At TP om ≥ T ∗ C4 symmetry is broken by a Pomer-
anchuk transition. The Fermi surface is deformed(see
Fig. 2) and doped holes are redistributed between the
oxygen orbitals of the unit cell. The sample consists
of domains with diﬀerent signs of the order parameter
corresponding to two alternatives presented in Fig.2.

• At TCDW < TP om a uniaxial d-form factor CDW
forms in each domain. CDW wave vector is along one of
the BZ axes dependinig on the sign of the Pomeranchuk
order parameter inside each domain (see Fig.2). The
CDW period generally exceeds the one corresponding
to antinodal nesting and is determined self-consistently

by the interaction and parameters of the Fermi surface.
Qualitatively, the CDW wavevector tracks the FS and
should decrease with hole doping (thus the CDW period
should increase).

Our ﬁndings help us in understanding the results
of recent experiments. The Pomeranchuk deformation
explains well why the C4-symmetry at commensurate
peaks in Fourier transformed STM data [10]. Formation
of domains with diﬀerent directions of the C4-symmetry
breaking is seen in STM experiments [12] and can also
help explaining results of the transport measurements
in YBCO [52]. It is important to note, though, that
the eﬀects of the deformation of the Fermi surface on
transport can be masked by existence of the domains.
This may also resolve the apparent contradiction to the
ARPES data [44,46] always showing a C4-symmetric
Fermi surface.

The most important aspect of the Pomeranchuk or-
der is that it explains the robustness of the axial d-
form factor CDW in the cuprates. We also note that
the organization of the CDW phase in the unidirec-
tional domains is indeed seen in STM [12] and XRD
[2,14] measurements. The coexistence of the unidirec-
tional CDW and Pomeranchuk order also allows one
to resolve a seeming contradiction to results obtained
in experiments on quantum oscillations [20]. Although
the unidirectional CDW leads to an open Fermi sur-
face that does not support quantum oscillations, the
simultaneous presence of a C4-symmetry breaking can
indeed [53] close the Fermi surface leading to quantum
oscillations in high magnetic ﬁelds.
