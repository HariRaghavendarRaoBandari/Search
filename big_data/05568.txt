Electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) cooling is a ground-state cooling technique for
trapped particles. EIT oﬀers a broader cooling range in frequency space compared to more es-
tablished methods. In this work, we experimentally investigate EIT cooling in strings of trapped
atomic ions. In strings of up to 18 ions, we demonstrate simultaneous ground state cooling of all
radial modes in under 1 ms. This is a particularly important capability in view of emerging quan-
tum simulation experiments with large numbers of trapped ions. Our analysis of the EIT cooling
dynamics is based on a novel technique enabling single-shot measurements of phonon numbers, by
rapid adiabatic passage on a vibrational sideband of a narrow transition.

INTRODUCTION

The development of laser cooling [1, 2] has resulted in
the preparation of neutral atoms [3, 4] and ions [5, 6]
at temperatures ranging from milli- to micro-kelvin or
even below. Cooling trapped particles to low tempera-
tures enables the spatial localization of single particles
at length scales which can be much smaller than optical
wavelengths, as well as the preparation of dense cold sam-
ples of atoms. This excellent quantum control over the
motional degrees of freedom of atoms and ions has led to
the wide-spread use of laser cooling techniques in various
research ﬁelds, such as atomic clocks [7, 8], atom interfer-
ometry [9], ultra-cold quantum gases [10], and quantum
information processing [11, 12] with atoms and ions.

While the minimum temperature achievable by a laser
cooling technique might be considered to be the ulti-
mate ﬁgure of merit, it is by no means the only one.
Other characteristics of a laser cooling scheme are the
range of initial temperatures over which it is applicable,
the achievable cooling rate and, in the case of trapped
particles, the range of trap oscillation frequencies over
which the cooling scheme is eﬀective. For this reason,
sophisticated schemes using interference of several laser
beams and/or multiple internal electronic states [13–20]
have been developed and employed in conjunction with
Doppler cooling to meet the demands posed by diﬀerent
applications.

In experiments with trapped ions, sideband cooling
on a narrow atomic transition [13] or Raman sideband
cooling [17] on a broad transition with far oﬀ-resonant

laser beams are both techniques capable of preparing an
ion in the lowest vibrational state of the trapping po-
tential. As these cooling techniques are applicable only
to ions already prepared at low temperatures, they are
performed after Doppler cooling [5, 6] the ions to tem-
peratures where they are in the Lamb-Dicke regime, i.e.
localized to much better than an optical wavelength.

Cooling by electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) [18] is yet another ground-state cooling technique,
which is applicable to pre-cooled ions. As with Raman
sideband cooling, EIT requires an atomic three-level sys-
tem coupled by a pair of laser beams. However, the laser
detunings are chosen such that, to ﬁrst order, the atomic
system is pumped into a dark state, which does not cou-
ple to the laser ﬁelds. Because of this property, sponta-
neous photon emission rates are signiﬁcantly lower than
for Raman sideband cooling, and therefore, so are the
heating processes intrinsic to the laser cooling scheme.
Consequently, the range of oscillation frequencies over
which the ion motion is cooled to close to the ground state
can be made wider than with Raman sideband cooling,
and higher cooling rates can be achieved. In comparison
to sideband cooling on narrow transitions, EIT cooling
also allows one to cool the ions over a wider frequency
range to low energies and has the additional beneﬁt of
requiring far less laser power.

EIT cooling was ﬁrst experimentally demonstrated
with a single trapped ion [19]. More recently, EIT has
been used to cool crystals of two and four ions [21], neu-
tral atoms in a cavity-QED setup [22] and in a quantum-
gas microscope [23]. It has also been proposed as a tech-
nique for cooling nanomechanical oscillators [24].

In the context of quantum information processing and
quantum simulation with ion strings, cooling one or sev-
eral vibrational modes to close to the ground state is a
prerequisite for most entanglement-generating atom-light
interactions. Controlled-NOT gates with single-ion ad-
dressing [25] require a mode to be prepared in the ground
state. The widely used entangling gates based on spin-

dependent forces [26] in principle only need the vibra-
tional state to be prepared in the Lamb-Dicke regime, but
experiments show that their performance improves [27]
the lower the vibrational occupation number becomes.
These applications make EIT cooling a powerful tech-
nique.

EIT cooling becomes even more appealing in the con-
text of recent experiments simulating quantum Ising
models in strings of up to eighteen ions [28–30]. In these
experiments all 2N radial modes of an N -ion string need
to be cooled to close to the ground state. While side-
band cooling can be used for cooling the modes sequen-
tially, the task of multi-mode cooling is particularly well
suited for EIT cooling. As we show in this paper, all the
modes can be ground-state cooled with a single EIT cool-
ing pulse in less than 100 µs if they are bunched together
in frequency space in a range of a few hundred kHz.

In this article, we give a description of our implemen-
tation of EIT cooling for trapped ions. The distinct
broadband cooling capability, which is of considerable
interest for all experiments having to deal with a dense
mode spectrum, is demonstrated in a two-ion crystal in
a segmented linear trap and in a nine and eighteen-ion
crystal in a macroscopic linear trap. Sec. II brieﬂy sum-
marizes the theory underlying EIT cooling. In Sec. III,
we introduce the two experimental setups used, detailing
brieﬂy the shared methods and procedures before sepa-
rately presenting the features of each of the two appara-
tuses and describing the cooling experiments in Sec. IV.
Sec. V concludes the article with a discussion of the re-
sults.

II. EIT COOLING MECHANISM

We brieﬂy review the theory of the EIT cooling based
on ref. [18] and discuss its implementation with 40Ca+,
the species used in the experiments presented.
EIT cooling requires a three-level Λ atomic system
where the coupling of two ground states, |g(cid:105) and |f(cid:105), to
one short-lived excited state |e(cid:105) leads to coherent popula-
tion trapping in a superposition of the two ground states
that does not couple to the excited state. Figure 1(a)
shows the basic EIT scheme: the |g(cid:105) ⇔ |e(cid:105) transition is
driven with a Rabi frequency, Ωσ, by a laser beam which
is blue-detuned by an amount ∆. The driving ﬁeld cre-
ates dressed states |˜g(cid:105), |˜e(cid:105), which are light-shifted up-
wards or downwards in frequency by an amount

from the bare states (where bare states are supposed to
include the energy of the photons of the dressing beam),
and pumps the atom to state |f(cid:105). A probe beam drives
the |f(cid:105) ⇔ |e(cid:105) transition with detuning ∆π and Rabi fre-
quency Ωπ (cid:28) Ωσ. The coupling of the second ground
state |f(cid:105) to the dressed states creates a Fano-like absorp-
tion proﬁle (Fig. 1(b)) [31]. For ∆π = ∆, the absorption

tem. One transition is driven by a strong, blue-detuned laser
(Rabi frequency Ωσ) creating dressed states. A weaker laser
probes the resulting Fano-like absorption proﬁle (b) where the
coupling to the dressed state |˜g(cid:105) results in a narrow absorption
feature. For a probe laser with a detuning ∆π equal to the one
of the dressing laser (∆/(2π) = 100 MHz), absorption on the
carrier transition is suppressed in steady state, and absorp-
tion on the red sideband |f, n(cid:105) ⇔ |˜g, n − 1(cid:105) is much stronger
than on the blue sideband (right-hand side of (a) and dashed
lines in the inset of (b)). (c) Cooling to the ground state can
be achieved over a wide range of trap frequencies as shown
for the parameters in (b).

becomes zero when the atom is held at a ﬁxed position
in space. If, however, the atom is trapped in a harmonic
trap with oscillation frequency ω, it can absorb light on
vibrational sidebands of the transition. Setting the light
shift δ of the dressing beam equal to the trap frequency,
δ = ω, maximizes the absorption probability on the red
sideband transition |f, n(cid:105) ⇔ |˜g, n− 1(cid:105). The phonon num-
ber n decreases by one unit for every absorption event.
As the absorption on the carrier transition |f, n(cid:105) ⇔ |˜g, n(cid:105)
vanishes, the only remaining heating mechanism in the
Lamb-Dicke regime is absorption on the blue sideband
which can be made much smaller than red sideband ab-
sorption (see inset of Fig. 1(b)).

The range of oscillation frequencies over which EIT
cooling is eﬃcient is set by choosing the detuning ∆,
which in turn determines the decay rate of the dressed
state |˜g(cid:105). Therefore, similar to other sideband cooling
schemes, there is a trade-oﬀ between the lowest achiev-
able temperatures and the range of oscillation frequencies
over which cooling can be achieved. However, due to the
suppressed carrier excitation, cooling close to the ground
state is possible over a fairly large cooling range. The dy-
namics of the cooling process is described by a diﬀerential

A−−A+

In 40Ca+, a good approximation to such a three-
level system is realized by using the Zeeman sublevels
of the S1/2 ⇔ P1/2 dipole-transition at 397 nm [19] for
EIT cooling, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). Dressed states
are generated by σ+-polarized light strongly coupling

the (cid:12)(cid:12)S1/2, m = −1/2(cid:11) ground state to the excited state
(cid:12)(cid:12)P1/2, m = 1/2(cid:11). A π-polarized laser beam coupling the
(cid:12)(cid:12)S1/2, m = +1/2(cid:11) state to the (cid:12)(cid:12)P1/2, m = +1/2(cid:11) probes

the absorption spectrum modiﬁed by the dressing laser.
The detunings of the EIT dressing and probe beams
have to be adjusted such that their diﬀerence matches
the Zeeman splitting of the ground state in the presence
of a magnetic ﬁeld. The π-polarized probe beam also

oﬀ-resonantly couples the states (cid:12)(cid:12)S1/2, m = −1/2(cid:11) and
(cid:12)(cid:12)P1/2, m = −1/2(cid:11). However, the additional heating in-
ulation in (cid:12)(cid:12)S1/2, m = −1/2(cid:11) due to optical pumping by
the(cid:12)(cid:12)P1/2, m = −1/2(cid:11) state and thus give rise to heating.

troduced by this coupling is negligible compared to other
heating processes of the EIT scheme as there is little pop-

the dressing laser. Of more serious concern are polariza-
tion imperfections of the EIT beams, which can depump

Such polarization imperfections may arise due to geomet-
ric constraints in the optical access to the ion, as is the
case in the experiments described in this article.
With a linewidth ΓPS/(2π) = 21.57(8) MHz [33], the
S1/2 ⇔ P1/2 transition enables fast cooling close to the
ground state as was shown for a single ion in ref.[19].

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUPS

For the experiments presented here, two diﬀerent kinds
of radio-frequency (rf) trap design were used: a macro-
scopic linear trap (setup 1) and a micro-fabricated seg-
mented two-layer trap (setup 2). In this section, the two
setups are described, followed by a presentation of the
procedures used to calibrate the parameters of the EIT
cooling laser beams in both experiments.

The releveant energy levels of 40Ca+ are sketched in
Fig. 2 (b).
Ions are loaded into the trap by two-step
photoionization of a beam of neutral calcium atoms us-
ing lasers operating at 422 nm and 375 nm. A laser at
397 nm Doppler-cools trapped ions on the S1/2 ⇔ P1/2
transition. A laser at 866 nm is used to repump popu-
lation from the metastable D3/2 state. The narrowline
quadrupole transition S1/2 ⇔ D5/2 is used for temper-
ature diagnostics.
It is driven by a Ti:Sa laser emit-
ting at 729 nm, which is stabilized to a high-ﬁnesse res-
onator with a ﬁnesse of a few hundred thousand, in or-
der to achieve a laser linewidth < 10 Hz. The D5/2
state’s lifetime of about 1.1 s [34] is quenched by apply-
ing laser light at 854 nm which couples the metastable
state to the short-lived P3/2 state. Read-out of the elec-
tronic state of the ions is carried out using the electron-
shelving method [35–37] with a photo-multiplier tube
or an electron-multiplying charged coupled device (EM-
CCD) camera for a measurement of the total or individ-
ual states of the ions.

The EIT cooling beams are derived from the same laser
that is used for Doppler-cooling the ions. While the ge-
ometries of the two experimental setups give rise to dif-
ferent beam conﬁgurations for the σ+ and the π beam, as
detailed below, the optical setups share the same princi-
ple: A part of the available 397 nm light is split into two
separate beam paths. Two independently programmable
acousto-optic modulators create laser pulses of precisely
controlled frequency, intensity and duration, which are
subsequently sent through single-mode ﬁbers to the vac-
uum chamber where they illuminate the ion crystal.

A. Setup 1: macroscopic linear trap

EIT cooling of long strings of ions was investigated in
a macroscopic linear ion trap with an endcap-to-endcap
electrode distance of 4.5 mm and a minimum electrode-
ion separation of 565 µm [38]. Two coils connected to
a stabilized-current drive generated a magnetic ﬁeld of
0.4 mT, oriented along the rf-zero ﬁeld line of the trap.
The geometry of the magnetic ﬁeld direction and the laser
beam k-vectors are shown in Fig. 2 (c). The frequency
diﬀerence of the EIT cooling beams was set to match
the resulting Zeeman ground state splitting of 11.4 MHz.
The σ+-polarized EIT dressing beam was detuned from
the S1/2 ⇔ P1/2 Zeeman transition by 106 MHz. The
wave vector of the EIT probe beam propagated at an
angle of 60 ° to the magnetic-ﬁeld vector. The Raman k-
vector of the EIT beams (set by their k-vector diﬀerence)
formed an angle of 60 ° with the axial direction of the
trap and had equal overlap with both principal axes of
the radial trapping potential. The EIT probe beam was
not perfectly π-polarized because it was not normal to
the quantization axis.

in this geometry.

A segmented trap like the one used in setup 2 is in prin-
ciple capable of creating anharmonic axial potentials for
the creation of ion strings with approximately equidis-
tantly spaced ions [40]. Technical diﬃculties with the
particular trap made it diﬃcult to reliably store long ion
crystals; for this reason, the majority of the EIT cooling
experiments were carried out in setup 1.

C. EIT beam parameter calibration

For EIT cooling, the frequency, intensity and polariza-
tion of both cooling beams have to be set properly. In the
following, we will discuss diﬀerent methods for measuring
the laser beam parameters.

Frequency calibration.— We set the frequency diﬀer-
ence of the beams by measuring the ground-state Zee-
man splitting spectroscopically on the S1/2 ⇔ D5/2
quadrupole transition. The overall detuning of the beams
from the S1/2 ⇔ P1/2 dipole transition was set by mea-
suring the spectral line proﬁle of the S1/2 ⇔ P1/2 transi-
tion with the Doppler cooling laser and frequency-shifting
the EIT beams by the desired amount by acousto-optical
modulators. As the EIT cooling beams were derived from
the same laser as the Doppler cooling beam, the uncer-
tainty in the determination of the EIT beam detuning
was due to systematic errors in the line center measure-
ment, which we estimated in our experiment to be below
10 MHz.

Polarization calibration.— The polarization of the EIT
probe beam was set by aligning the beam’s polarization
at the entrance of the vacuum system with the magnetic
ﬁeld by rotating the polarization into the plane spanned
by the magnetic ﬁeld vector and the beam’s k-vector.

The polarization of the EIT dressing beam was con-
trolled by a quarter-wave plate in front of the viewport,
converting the linear polarization coming out of an op-
tical ﬁbre into σ+-polarization.
In setup 2, the polar-
ization was adjusted by minimizing the population in

the (cid:12)(cid:12)S1/2, m = −1/2(cid:11) state, detected by carrying out a
π pulse on the (cid:12)(cid:12)S1/2, m = −1/2(cid:11) ⇔ (cid:12)(cid:12)D5/2, m = −1/2(cid:11)

transition followed by a measurement of the D5/2 popu-
lation. We judged this measurement to be more precise
than a minimization of the ﬂuorescence signal induced
by the σ+ beam. An even better technique, applied in
setup 1, wis discussed at the end of this section.

Intensity calibration.— Optimal EIT cooling of a vi-
brational mode of frequency ω requires making the light
shift δ, induced by the σ+-polarized light, equal to ω. For
a ﬁxed detuning ∆ of the EIT beams, the light shift was
set by controlling the intensity (∝ Ω2
σ) of the dressing
beam (see Eq. (1)). Two diﬀerent intensity calibration
techniques were employed in the experiments. First, light
shifts can be precisely determined by measuring the opti-
cal pumping rate between S1/2 Zeeman states [33]. This
technique (used in setup 2) relies on a precise knowledge
of the laser parameters and the excited state’s decay rate.

(a-b) Schematic of the 40Ca+ transitions used in the
FIG. 2:
experiment. EIT cooling is implemented using the Zeeman
sublevels of the S1/2 ⇔ P1/2 dipole transition. The dipole-
allowed transitions for Doppler cooling, detection and quench-
ing are excited by light at 397 nm, 866 nm and 854 nm while
the quadrupole transition that is used for motional state anal-
ysis is driven by light at 729 nm. Beam conﬁguration for EIT
cooling in setup 1 (c) and setup 2 (d). The trap axis denotes
the direction in which the rf-zero ﬁeld line is oriented.

B. Setup 2: segmented trap

A two-layer gold-on-alumina sandwich trap [39] with
an ion-electrode separation of 258 µm and a segment
length of 250 µm was used to trap a crystal of two 40Ca+
ions. Four coils connected to stabilized-current drives
generated a magnetic ﬁeld of 0.33 mT aligned at an an-
gle of 75 ° to the trap axis (see Fig. 2 (d)). The magnetic
ﬁeld lifted the degeneracy of the ground Zeeman levels,
resulting in a level splitting of 9.3 MHz.

The frequency diﬀerence of the two EIT cooling beams
was chosen to match the ground-state state Zeeman split-
ting. The detuning of the σ+-polarized EIT beam from
the S1/2 ⇔ P1/2 Zeeman transition that it was driving
was ∆/(2π) ≈ 105 MHz. The σ+ beam was aligned paral-
lel to the magnetic ﬁeld. The k-vector of the π-polarized
light had an angle of 45 ° to the magnetic ﬁeld. This
choice was dictated by constraints in the available opti-
cal access and led to imperfect π polarization, with the
additional polarization components heating the ion. The
trap axis lay in the plane spanned by the two EIT cooling
beams. It formed an angle of 75 ° with the direction of
the magnetic ﬁeld and an angle of 52.5 ° with the Raman
k-vector of the EIT beams. The two principal radial di-
rections (mutually orthogonal with weak axis) both had
an overlap with the Raman k-vector. All three sets of vi-
brational modes were therefore accessible to EIT-cooled

(cid:12)(cid:12)S1/2, m = −1/2(cid:11) ⇔ (cid:12)(cid:12)D5/2, m = −5/2(cid:11) transition. This
this scheme depletes the(cid:12)(cid:12)D5/2, m = −5/2(cid:11) state by opti-
cally pumping the population into(cid:12)(cid:12)S1/2, m = +1/2(cid:11), the

was followed by a measurement of the D-state proba-
bility as a function of the 729 nm laser frequency. As

light shift was determined by measuring the shift of the
729 nm laser frequency from the unperturbed transition
frequency at which the probability for being in the D5/2
state is at a minimum.

Figure 3(c) shows results from an application of the
technique (in setup 1) for the case of a dressing laser
inducing a shift of about 2.3 MHz. For a 729 nm laser
pulse with Rabi frequency Ω = (2π) 39 kHz, a pulse du-
ration of τ = 250 µs was found to optimally deplete the
D5/2 state without causing unnecessary broadening of the
resonance. The measured excitation was ﬁtted by numer-
ically simulating the dynamics using a master-equation
approach. The same calibration method was also em-
ployed to set the intensity of the EIT probe beam to a
value much smaller than the dressing-beam intensity.

A variation of this technique can be used for optimiz-
ing the σ+ polarization of the EIT dressing beam as is
illustrated in Fig. 3(b),(d). A Ramsey experiment was
carried out on the |S1/2, m = 1/2(cid:105) ⇔ |D5/2, m = 5/2(cid:105)
transition with a 397 nm EIT dressing pulse of variable
duration sandwiched between the two Ramsey π/2 pulses
with optical phases shifted by π/2 with respect to each
other. If the blue light is perfectly σ+-polarized, it will
have no eﬀect on the superposition state, resulting in a
ﬁnal D5/2 state population of 0.5 irrespective of the pulse
duration. If, however, the pulse is imperfectly polarized,
then the pumping and light-shifting action of the undesir-
able σ− or π polarization components will give rise to an
exponentially decaying oscillatory signal as a function of
the length of the EIT dressing pulse. This technique en-
ables a very precise suppression of spurious polarization
components as the data shown Fig. 3 (d) demonstrates.
In this experiment, which used nine ions, optimization of
the polarization reduced unwanted light shifts by wrong
polarization components to 10.8(5) kHz whereas the de-
sired polarization component induced a shift of about
2200 kHz, which was inferred from an independent ex-
periment as depicted in Fig. 3(a),(c). The measurement
shows that the technique enables the detection of un-
wanted polarization components with fractional power
well below 10−3.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The basic experimental sequence for investigating EIT
cooling consists of the following steps: (i) the ions are
Doppler-cooled on the S1/2 ⇔ P1/2 transition for a few
milliseconds. (ii) The 397 nm EIT cooling beams are ap-

A. EIT cooling of multi-ion crystals

We investigated EIT cooling of linear ion crystals held
in strongly anisotropic harmonic potentials, which result
in a radial mode spectrum whose width is considerably
smaller than its mean mode frequency. This conﬁgura-
tion is of interest in experiments where a laser-induced
coupling of the radial modes to the internal states of
the ions is used either for studying spin-boson models or
long-range spin-spin interactions mediated by the radial
modes [28, 29, 41]. A distinctive feature of this conﬁgu-
ration is the low axial center-of-mass (COM) frequency,
which is typically about an order of magnitude smaller
than the radial center-of-mass frequencies.
In setup 1, measurements were taken using a crystal of
nine ions with COM mode frequencies of {ωz, ωr1, ωr2} =

2π {0.50, 2.59, 2.76} MHz and a crystal of eighteen ions
frequencies of {ωz, ωr1, ωr2} =
with COM modes
2π {0.21, 2.68, 2.71} MHz. Note that the COM modes
are the highest-frequency radial modes, but the lowest-
frequency axial mode.

For the nine-ion crystal, all radial modes were cooled
simultaneously by centering the light shift induced by
the dressing beam roughly in the middle of the radial
mode spectrum at 2.2 MHz, which corresponded to set-
ting Ωσ = (2π) 30 MHz. The intensity of the probe beam
was set such that Ωπ = (2π) 6.2 MHz (cid:28) Ωσ.

Figure 4 compares the radial sideband spectrum of a
Doppler-cooled nine-ion crystal with a spectrum obtained
after an additional EIT cooling pulse of 1 ms duration.
The complete vanishing of the red sideband absorption
in case of the EIT-cooled ion crystal indicates that all 18
radial modes were simultaneously cooled to the ground
state of motion.

EIT cooling of all radial modes was also observed for
an eighteen-ion crystal. Figure 5 shows the radial red
sideband absorption spectrum after Doppler cooling (up-
per plot) and after an additional 1 ms EIT cooling pulse
(lower plot). Again, absorption on all 36 radial sidebands
completely disappears.

The strong reduction of the red-sideband absorption
is indicative of ground-state cooling. However, the com-

vestigate motional states in multi-ion systems. However,
apart from the technical diﬃculty of achieving single-ion
addressing, such an approach would yield only one bit of
information per measurement.

For these reasons, we developed a novel experimen-
tal technique applicable to an N -ion crystal that yields
single-shot measurements of the lowest Fock states (and
provides N bits of
information): The cooling limit
and cooling dynamics of the EIT method are investi-
gated by means of rapid adiabatic passages (RAPs) [42].
In trapped-ion experiments, RAPs have been used for
electronic-state manipulation [43, 44] and for Fock-state
measurements with a single ion [45] by multiple RAPs.
For an ion string, a RAP on a red-sideband transition en-
ables conversion of phononic into electronic excitations if
the laser pulse is globally applied to all the ions in a
crystal that is initially prepared in the electronic ground
state. For the radial center-of-mass mode, the mapping
is one-to-one for phonon numbers smaller than or equal
to N . For modes with unequal Lamb-Dicke factors, the
mapping works reliably for phonon numbers ≤ N/2 [42].
Using this technique, we obtain single-shot measurements
of the phonon number by detecting the number of elec-
tronically excited ions after the RAP.

In the RAPs used in our experiments, we typically
swept the laser frequency within 4-5 ms over a frequency
range of 50 kHz centered around the sideband frequency.
We applied a Gauss-like temporal intensity proﬁle with
a peak Rabi frequency of about 200 kHz on the carrier
transition.

As an imperfect mapping of phononic to electronic ex-
citations would make the cooling results look better than
they actually are, the validity of the mapping technique
was checked by carrying out RAPs on the red sideband
for an ion string prepared in the electronic metastable
state instead of the electronic ground state. In this case,
the RAP always couples sets of N +1 states together and
therefore one expects to be able to perfectly invert the
electronic state irrespective of the number of phonons. In
experiments with nine ions, we indeed observed a near-
perfect transfer of the ions to the electronic ground state
when exciting the ions on the red sideband of a radial
COM mode: in more than 80% of the experiments, the
state transfer was perfect; on average, 8.78(3) instead of
9 excitations were transferred.

We determined the mean phonon numbers of various
radial modes of EIT-cooled nine- and eighteen-ion crys-
tals.
In all cases we found mean phonon numbers of
about 0.01 to 0.02 after EIT cooling. We also mea-
sured the enviroment-induced heating rate of the highest-
frequency radial COM mode of a nine-ion crystal by in-
troducing a variable delay between the EIT cooling and
the RAP analysis. The data displayed in Fig. 6 show a
linear increase of the mean phonon number to about 5
after 80 ms wait time, corresponding to a heating rate of
(65 ± 7) s−1. As the RAP technique enables single-shot
phonon-number measurements, the data also conﬁrms
that the phonon distribution is thermal, as expected for

parison of the absorption probabilities on the red side-
band, pr, and the blue sideband, pb, of a vibrational mode
does not yield a simple quantitative estimate of the mean
phonon number. This is in contrast to the case of a laser
addressing a single ion only, where ¯n = pr/(pb − pr).
This formula is no longer valid if all ions are excited
simultaneously as can be seen from the Doppler-cooled
sideband spectrum of Fig. 4 (a), where a marked absorp-
tion asymmetry between red and blue sidebands occurs
even though Doppler cooling should lead to mean phonon
number of about ¯n ≈ 5, i.e. to a sthate where the cou-
pling strengths on the red and blue sidebands are very
similar for the majority of the phonon distribution.

In order to obtain an estimate of ¯n after EIT cooling,
we numerically simulated the red-sideband absorption
spectrum of a nine-ion crystal for the parameters of our
experiment. As the relevant state space of all vibrational
modes was too big for numerical simulations (∼ 1020),
we calculated the spectrum in the vicinity of each mode
by assuming that a spatially homogeneous laser beam
coupled N two-level atoms only to the vibrational mode
of interest. This approach reduced the state space to
sets of at most N + 1 coupled states, |ψn
k(cid:105) = ( ˆS+)k|0, n(cid:105),
where ˆS+ is an electronic raising operator deﬁned via
i a with ηim the Lamb-Dicke factor of
ion i and mode m, and |j, n(cid:105) denotes an N -ion state
with j electronic and n vibrational excitations. When
starting with all ions in the electronic ground state, the
simulated spectra closely resembled the experimental re-
sults of Fig. 4 (a) for thermal phonon distributions with
¯n ≈ 5−8. The blue-sideband spectra were simulated with
a similar approach and also matched the observations.

While such numerical simulations provide estimates of
mean phonon numbers, it is hard to quantify the accu-
racy of the results. Alternatively, addressing of single
ions in ion strings could be used to experimentally in-

FIG. 6: Heating rate measurement by sideband RAPs. After
EIT cooling a nine-ion crystal, the mean phonon number after
varying waiting times was measured using a RAP on the red
sideband of a COM mode at 2.74 MHz. The histograms show
the measured phonon distributions after 20 ms and 40 ms of
waiting time together with a ﬁtted thermal distribution (solid
line). A linear ﬁt to the data (dashed line) yields a heating
rate of (65± 7) s−1, which is about nine times higher than the
heating rate observed for a single ion.

a process coupling a ground-state cooled mode to a high-
temperature reservoir.

The measured nine-ion COM mode heating rate was
about an order of magnitude higher than the measured
heating rate of a single ion in the same trapping poten-
tial. This observation is consistent with our expectation
to ﬁnd a heating rate of the COM mode that scales lin-
early with the number of ions, as electric-ﬁeld noise act-
ing on diﬀerent ions is nearly perfectly correlated in a
macroscopic linear trap. Under these condition, all the
energy taken up by the ions is deposited in the COM
mode, thus heating this mode [46, 47] at a much higher
rate than the one, when there is only a single ion in the
trap. Unexpectedly, higher-order radial modes showed a
non-zero heating rate which seemed to become higher for
shorter-wavelength modes. The origin of this source of
heating is currently not clear; one possible source might
be a mode cross-coupling with the axial normal modes
[48], some of which are populated with tens or hundreds
of phonons. We plan to investigate this issue in future
experiments.

The EIT cooling dynamics was investigated with an
eighteen-ion crystal: Doppler-cooled ions were subjected
to an EIT cooling pulse of variable duration followed by a
RAP measuring the resulting phonon distribution. Fig-
ure 7 shows the results obtained for the lowest-frequency
radial mode at 2.08 MHz. This mode of the ion string
was cooled below a mean phonon number of one after
less than 50 µs of EIT cooling, reaching a steady state
after approximately 300 µs. For a ﬁt of the dynamics,
we assume that the time evolution of the mean phonon

FIG. 7: EIT cooling dynamics. The radial mode at 2.08 MHz
of an eighteen-ion crystal in a linear trap was EIT cooled
with a σ+ induced light shift of 2.3 MHz for varying cool-
ing duration. A RAP pulse mapped the phonon number to
the electronic state of the ions, which was subsequently mea-
sured. The histograms give the probability for observing a
given number of excited ions running from none to all the
ions within the crystal, as depicted for various cooling times
in the insets. The mean phonon number was derived from a
thermal ﬁt to the data (solid line). The dashed line is a ﬁt of
the measured phonon numbers to the model described in the
main text. It yields a cooling rate of (19 ± 3)103 s−1.

number ¯n is given by ˙¯n = −R¯n + Rh where R is the
laser cooling rate and Rh accounts for heating processes,
resulting in ¯n(t) = Ae−Rt + neq. To extract the cool-
ing rate, a least-square ﬁtting routine was applied to the
logarithm of the measured mean phonon number in or-
der to properly weight the later points in the cooling
dynamics. The cooling rate calculated in this way was
(19 ± 3) 103 s−1.

For both the nine-ion crystal and the eighteen-ion
crystal, the fast cooling rates are a signiﬁcant improve-
ment over the ones obtained by sideband cooling on the
quadrupole transition where several milliseconds of cool-
ing time are required to cool multiple modes to close to
the motional ground state [49].

B. EIT cooling of a two-ion crystal in a segmented

trap

In the segmented trap setup, we investigated the
EIT cooling range and rate for a two-ion crystal held
in a potential with center-of-mass mode frequencies of
{ωz, ωr1, ωr2} = 2π {1.13, 3.29, 3.84} MHz. We measured
the mean phonon number of all six vibrational modes by
analysis of Rabi oscillations on the red (blue) sidebands
of the S1/2 ⇔ D5/2 transition. These oscillations were
recorded by coherently exciting only one of the ions us-
ing a strongly focused beam addressing one of the ions

phonon number was then determined by ﬁtting the re-
sulting sideband Rabi oscillations with a thermal phonon
number distribution [50].

Figure 8 depicts all data taken: the cooling eﬃciency is
quantiﬁed in terms of the ﬁnal phonon populations ver-
sus the induced EIT light shift (panels a,b), and in terms
of achievable cooling rates (panels c,d). The upper pan-
els display results for the COM modes; the lower panels
summarize the results for the stretch and rocking modes.
While the cooling of the axial COM mode reached a mini-
mum phonon number of about one, all other modes were
cooled to mean phonon numbers below one over a fre-
quency range of about 1 MHz.

The EIT cooling rate measurements shown in Fig. 8 (c)
and (d) were obtained for light shifts achieving the low-
est mode temperatures. Exponential ﬁts (indicated by
dashed lines) were used to extract the cooling rate for
the various modes, which are summarized in Tab. I. The
measured cooling rates illustrate the potential for fast
cooling with the EIT method, reaching a mean phonon
number of below one within 0.5 ms for all modes. This
is a four-fold speed-up compared to the sideband cooling
scheme commonly used in this experiment, where cool-
ing a single mode to less than one phonon takes 2 ms or
more.

The observed minimum phonon number for COM
modes were slightly higher than the ones of the out-

of-phase modes. This eﬀect is attributed to the larger
COM-mode heating at rates that are only an order of
magnitude smaller than the cooling rates in this setup.
However, motional heating by stray electric ﬁelds is not
the dominant mechanism limiting the lowest achievable
mean phonon numbers. We attribute the worse cooling
results observed in this setup (as compared to setup 1)
to the less ideal cooling-beam geometry and to problems
with achieving good micromotion compensation.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We investigated the use of EIT cooling for preparing
the radial vibrational modes of long ion strings close to
the ground state. Our experiments demonstrate that
EIT cooling can indeed ground-state cool all modes over
a wide frequency range, with sub-millisecond cooling
times. This makes EIT cooling an attractive technique
for trapped-ion experiments designed for studies of long-
range Ising spin models.

In recent experiments [28], we cooled radial modes of
long strings to the ground state by a series of sideband
cooling pulses on a narrow transition, with each pulse
being tailored to cool groups of modes in a particular fre-
quency range. EIT cooling not only substantially short-
ens the cooling time as compared to sideband cooling
on a narrow transition but also provides a more robust
cooling technique with a smaller number of optimization
parameters.

We did observe, however, that in the currently used
cooling conﬁguration for highly anisotropic traps, EIT
cooling gave rise to a substantial heating of low-frequency
axial modes as the eﬀective cooling k-vector also has an
overlap with these modes. This is in contradiction to the
predictions of the simple EIT cooling model presented
in section II. According to that model, all axial modes
could be cooled below the Doppler limit achievable on the
S1/2 ⇔ P1/2 transition. This problem might be related
to the experimental observation that the axial motion of
the ion string was not in the Lamb-Dicke regime after
Doppler cooling (as is assumed in the cooling model).

10

We expect the ion motion along the axial direction to
break up the coherent population trapping induced by
the EIT beams, leading to additional light scattering and
giving rise to heating eﬀects. In future work, it would be
interesting to measure the photon scattering rate during
EIT cooling to infer the upper state populations for a
comparison with the EIT cooling model. The diﬃculties
described above could be overcome in future experiments
by choosing an EIT cooling beam conﬁguration featuring
an EIT k-vector perpendicular to the ion string, so that it
does not couple to and thereby heat low-frequency axial
modes.

In conclusion, EIT cooling is an attractive technique
for trapped-ion experiments requiring many vibrational
modes to be cooled close to the ground states, as is the
case in current quantum simulation experiments with
long ion strings. Another interesting application would
be the cooling of mixed-species ion crystals in quantum
logic spectroscopy experiments where low motional ener-
gies are required for precision measurements of transition
frequencies [51].
