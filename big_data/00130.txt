INTRODUCTION

The J P C = 1−− ground state of the charmonium family, the J/ψ meson, was discovered in

1974 simultaneously both from the e+e− invariant mass by the MIT-BNL group [1] and from

an enormous increase of the cross sections for hadronic, µ+µ− and e+e− ﬁnal states by the

SLAC-LBL group [2]. Since then the study on the J/ψ particle and its family members has

attracted much persistent attentions of experimentalists and theorists due to the facts that:

on the one hand, the charmonium states oﬀer an excellent platform to test and improve our

understanding of the strong interactions at both perturbative and nonperturbative levels; on

the other hand, there is a great renewed interest due to the massive dedicated investigation

at BES, CLEO-c, LHCb and the studies via decays of B mesons at B factories.

One of the most surprising feature of the J/ψ meson is its narrow width, ΓJ/ψ = 92.9±2.8
keV [3], which indicates that the decays of J/ψ into light hadrons are suppressed dynamically.

The reason for the extremely small decay width of the J/ψ meson is usually referred to by

the phenomenological OZI (Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka) rules [4–6], which states that processes

with “detached” quark lines are suppressed.
It is well known that the mass of the J/ψ
meson is below the D ¯D threshold. Hence, in despite of the OZI suppression, the J/ψ decay

into hadrons are dominated by the strong and electromagnetic interactions, and the decay

modes at the lowest order approximation could be divided into four types: (1) the hadronic
decay via the annihilation of the c¯c quark pairs into three gluons, i.e., J/ψ → ggg → X, (2)
the electromagnetic decay via the c¯c annihilation into a virtual photon, i.e., J/ψ → γ ∗ →
X, (3) the radiative decay via the c¯c annihilation into one photon and two gluons, i.e., J/ψ
→ γgg → γ + X, (4) the magnetic dipole transition to ηc, i.e., J/ψ → γηc → γ + X [7, 8],
where X denotes the possible ﬁnal hadrons. Besides, the J/ψ meson can decay into hadrons

also via the weak interactions, although the branching ratio for inclusive weak decays via

a single c or ¯c quark decay relying on the spectator model is very small, about 2/(τDΓJ/ψ)
∼ 10−8 [3, 9]. In this paper, we will concentrate on the ﬂavor-changing nonleptonic J/ψ →
DM weak decays with the QCD factorization (QCDF) approach [10–15], where M denotes

the low-lying SU(3) pseudoscalar and vector meson nonet. The reasons are listed as follows.

From the experimental point of view, (1) with the running of high-luminosity dedicated

heavy-ﬂavor factories, more and more J/ψ events have been accumulating. It is hopefully

expected to produce about 1010 J/ψ events at BESIII per year of data taking with the

2

designed luminosity [16], and over 1010 prompt J/ψ events at LHCb per f b−1 data [17]. The

availability of such large samples enables a realistic possibility to explore experimentally the

nonleptonic J/ψ weak decays, so the corresponding theoretical studies are very necessary

to provide a ready reference. (2) The detection of a single D meson coming from the J/ψ

weak process is free from ineﬃcient double tagging of the charmed meson pairs occurring
above the D ¯D threshold. In addition, the deﬁnite energies and momenta of the back-to-back

ﬁnal states in the center-of-mass frame of the J/ψ meson would provide an unambiguous

signature. With the help of remarkable improvements of experimental instrumentation and

sophisticated particle identiﬁcation techniques, the accurate measurements on the hadronic
J/ψ → DM weak decays may now be feasible. Recently, a search for the Cabibbo favored
J/ψ → Dsρ, DuK ∗ decays is performed with available 2.25×108 J/ψ events accumulated
with the BESIII detector, but no evident signal is observed due to insuﬃcient statistics

[18]. Of course, such small branching ratios make the observation of nonleptonic J/ψ weak

decays extremely challenging, and observation of an abnormally large production rate of

single charmed mesons in e+e− collisions would be a hint of new physics beyond the standard

model.

From the theoretical point of view, (1) the nonleptonic J/ψ weak decay has been studied

in previous works using the factorization scheme, such as Ref.[9] based on the spin symmetry

and nonrecoil approximation, Ref.[19] with the QCD sum rules, Ref.[20] with the covariant

light-cone quark model, and Refs.[21–23] with the Bauer-Stech-Wirbel (BSW) model [24, 25].

Due to that the transition form factor is one of the essential ingredients for the charmonium

weak decay, the previous studies [9, 19–23] mainly concern the calculation of the weak

transition form factors dominated by the nonperturbative dynamics, which lead surely to

unavoidable uncertainties on theoretical predictions. Since the charmonium could be well
handled with the nonrelativistic QCD, observables of the J/ψ → DM decays might be used
to test and ameliorate various models by comparison with measurements. (2) In recent years,

several attractive QCD-inspired methods have been substantially developed and successfully

used to cope with the hadronic matrix elements of nonleptonic B weak decays, such as the

soft and collinear eﬀective theory [26–33] and QCDF based on the collinear factorization

approximation and power countering rules in the heavy quark limit, the perturbative QCD

approach [34–39] based on the kT factorization scheme. These methods mainly concern the

underlying dynamical mechanism of the weak decays of heavy ﬂavor hadrons, and could

3

be applied to the weak decays of heavy quarkonium. The analysis of nonleptonic J/ψ

weak decays are particularly interesting in exploring mechanism responsible for hadronic

transitions and very important for study of the applicability of factorization theorem and
QCD properties at the scale of O(mc). Further, the weak decay of the J/ψ particle oﬀers
a unique opportunity to probe polarization eﬀects involved in vector meson decays, which

might be helpful to investigate the underlying structure and dynamics of heavy quarkonium.

This paper is organized as follows. In section II, we will present the theoretical framework
and the amplitudes for nonleptonic J/ψ → DM weak decays within the QCDF framework.
The section III is devoted to numerical results and discussion. Finally, the section IV is our

summation.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

A. The eﬀective Hamiltonian

The low energy eﬀective Hamiltonian responsible for the nonleptonic J/ψ → DM weak

decays can be written as [40]:

Heﬀ =

GF√2 Xq1,q2

cq1Vuq2 nC1(µ) Q1(µ) + C2(µ) Q2(µ)o + h.c.,
V ∗

(1)

where the Fermi coupling constant GF ≃ 1.166×10−5 GeV−2 [3]; V ∗
Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) factor and q1,2 = d, s; The Wilson coeﬃcients C1,2(µ) summarize

cq1Vuq2 is the Cabibbo-

the physical contributions above the scale of µ. The expressions of the local tree four-quark

operators are

Q1 = [¯q1,αγµ(1 − γ5)cα][¯uβγµ(1 − γ5)q2,β],
Q2 = [¯q1,αγµ(1 − γ5)cβ][¯uβγµ(1 − γ5)q2,α],

(2)

(3)

where α and β are color indices and the sum over repeated indices is understood.

factors V ∗

Here, we would like to point out that (1) due to the large cancellation of the CKM
csVus ∼ O(λ5) where the Wolfenstein parameter λ = sinθc = 0.225 37(61)
[3] and θc is the Cabibbo angle, the contributions of penguin and annihilation operators

cdVud + V ∗

are strongly suppressed and could be safely neglected if the CP -violating asymmetries that

are expected to be very tiny due to the small weak phase diﬀerence for c quark decay are

4

prescinded from the present consideration.

(2) The Wilson coeﬃcients Ci are calculable

with the perturbation theory and have properly been evaluated to the next-to-leading order
(NLO). Their values at the scale of µ ∼ O(mc) can be obtained with the renormalization
group (RG) equation [40],

~C(µ) = U4(µ, mb)M(mb)U5(mb, mW ) ~C(mW ),

(4)

where Uf (µf , µi) is the RG evolution matrix transforming the Wilson coeﬃcients from the

scale µi to µf , and M(µ) is the quark threshold matching matrix. The explicit expressions

of Uf (µf , µi) and M(µ) can be found in Ref.[40]. The numerical values of LO and NLO C1,2

in naive dimensional regularization scheme are listed in Table I. The values of NLO Wilson

coeﬃcients in Table I are consistent with those given by Refs.[25, 40, 41], where a trick with

“eﬀective” number of active ﬂavors f = 4.15 rather than formula Eq.(4) is used by Ref.[40].

(3) To obtain the decay amplitudes and branching ratios, the remaining works are how to

accurately evaluate the hadronic matrix elements where the local operators are sandwiched

between the initial and ﬁnal states, which is also the most intricate melody in dealing with

the weak decay of heavy hadrons by now.

B. Hadronic matrix elements

Phenomenologically, the simplest treatment on hadronic matrix elements of a four fermion

operator is the approximation by the product of the decay constants and the transition form

factors based on the color transparency ansatz [42] and the naive factorization scheme (NF)

[43, 44]. As well known, the NF’s defects are very obvious and displayed as the absence of the

renormalization scale dependence, the strong phases and the nonfactorizatable corrections

from the hadronic matrix elements, which result in nonphysical decay amplitudes and the

incapacity of prediction on CP -violating asymmetries. To remedy this situation, M. Beneke

et al. [10, 11] proposed that the hadronic matrix elements could be written as the convolution

integrals of hard scattering kernels and the light cone distribution amplitudes with the QCDF

approach.

Using the QCDF master formula, the hadronic matrix elements for the J/ψ → DM

decays could be expressed as :

hDM|Qi|J/ψi = Xi

F J→D

i

Z dx Hi(x) ΦM (x) = Xi

F J→D

i

fM{1 +

(5)

where F J→D

i

is the transition form factor and ΦM (x) is the light cone distribution amplitude

of the emitted meson M with the decay constant fM , which are assumed to be dominated

by nonperturbative contributions and taken as universal inputs.

Here, we would like to point out that (1) for the J/ψ → DM decay, the spectator quark
It is commonly thought that the virtuality of

is the almost on-shell charm (anti)quark.

the gluon tied up with the heavy spectator quark is of order Λ2

QCD. The hard and soft

contributions associated with the charmed spectator entangle with each other and cannot

be separated properly. According to the basic idea of the QCDF approach [11], the physical

form factors that could be obtained from lattice QCD or QCD sum rules are introduced

as inputs, and the hard spectator scattering contributions that are power suppressed in the

heavy quark limit disappeared from Eq.(5). (2) The hard scattering kernels Hi(x), including

the nonfactorizable vertex corrections, are computable order by order with the perturbation

theory in principle. At the order α0

s, Hi(x) = 1, i.e., the convolution integral of Eq.(5) results

in a decay constant and one goes back to the simple NF scenario. At the order αs and higher

orders, the information of the renormalization scale dependence and strong phases hidden

in hadronic matrix elements could be partly recuperated. Combined the nonfactorizable

contributions with the Wilson coeﬃcients, the scale independent eﬀective coeﬃcients at the

order αs can be obtained [12]:

where ¯x = 1 − x; aM

It is found that (1) for the coeﬃcient a1, nonfactorizable vertex corrections can provide ≥
10% enhancement compared with the NF’s value, and a small strong phase ≤ 5◦. (2) for the

6

coeﬃcient a2, contributions of vertex corrections assisted with the large Wilson coeﬃcient C1
are signiﬁcant, and a relatively large strong phase ∼ −115◦ is obtained. (3) the magnitude
of a1,2 agrees well with that from the ﬁt on hadronic D weak decays [48, 49], but with more

information on the strong phases.

C. Decay amplitude

Within the QCDF framework, the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes for J/ψ → DM decays

can be expressed as:

A(J/ψ→DM) = hDM|Heﬀ|J/ψi =

GF√2

cq1Vuq2 ai hM|J µ|0ihD|Jµ|J/ψi.
V ∗

(10)

The matrix elements of current operators are deﬁned as follows:

hP (p)|Aµ|0i = −ifP pµ,
hV (p, ǫ)|Vµ|0i = fV mV ǫ∗
µ,

(11)

(12)

where fP and fV are the decay constants of pseudoscalar and vector mesons, respectively;

mV and ǫ denote the mass and polarization of vector meson, respectively.

The transition form factors are deﬁned as follows [19–25]:

hD(p2)|Vµ − Aµ|J/ψ(p1, ǫ)i

J qα (p1 + p2)β V J→D(q2)

(q2)

(13)

where q = p1 − p2; and A0(0) = A3(0) is required compulsorily to cancel singularities at the
pole q2 = 0. There is a relation among these form factors

2mJ A3(q2) = (mJ + mD)A1(q2) + (mJ − mD)A2(q2).

(14)

It is clearly seen that there are only three independent form factors, A0,1(0) and V (0),
at the pole q2 = 0 for the hadronic J/ψ → DM decays. From the convolution integral
expressions of form factors at zero momentum transfer in terms of participating meson wave

functions given in Refs.[23–25], there is approximately a hierarchic relationship, i.e.,

V J→D(0) ≈ 3AJ→D

(15)

which are also veriﬁed by the numbers of Table 1 in Ref.[23].

With the above deﬁnition, amplitudes for J/ψ → DP , DV decay are explicitly listed in
the Appendix A and B. Here, we would like to point out that (1) the amplitudes for J/ψ →
DV decays are conventionally expressed by helicity amplitudes, which They are deﬁned by

the decomposition [50–52],

There scalar amplitudes a, b, c describe the s, d, p wave contributions, respectively. Clearly,

compared with the s wave amplitude, the p and d wave amplitudes are suppressed by a

factor of mV /mJ . (2) The light vector mesons are assumed ideally mixed, i.e., the ω =
(u¯u + d ¯d)/√2 and φ = s¯s. As for the mixing of pseudoscalar η and η′ meson, we will adopt
the quark-ﬂavor basis description proposed in Ref.[53], and neglect the contributions from

possible gluonium and c¯c compositions, i.e.,

be written as

The input parameters in our calculation, including the CKM Wolfenstein parameters,

decay constants of mesons, Gegenbauer moments of distribution amplitudes in Eq.(9), are

collected in Table II. If not speciﬁed explicitly, we will take their central values as the default

inputs. As well known, the transition form factors are essential parameters in the QCDF

master formula of Eq.(5), but the discrepancy among previous results on form factors with

diﬀerent models (see Table 1 of Ref.[23]) is still large. In this paper, we will use the mean

values of the form factors given in Ref.[21] with additional uncertainties to oﬀer an order of

magnitude estimation, i.e.,

Our numerical results on the CP -averaged branching ratios for J/ψ → DP , DV decays
are displayed in Table III, where theoretical uncertainties of the last column come from the
CKM parameters, the renormalization scale µ = (1±0.2)mc, decay constants and Gegen-
bauer moments, transition form factors, respectively. For comparison, the previous results
[19, 22, 23] with coeﬃcients a1 = 1.26 and a2 = −0.51 are also listed in the columns 3–7
of Table III, where numbers in the columns 3 and 4–7 are calculated with diﬀerent form

factors based on QCD sum rules and BSW model, respectively; numbers in the columns 4–7

correspond to the form factors given by the ﬂavor dependent ω (“A” column), QCD inspired
ω = αs×m (“B” column), the universal ω = 4 GeV (“C” column) and ω = 5 GeV (“D”
column), respectively; and ω, the average transverse quark momentum, is a parameter of

the BSW wave functions. The following are some comments.

(1) There are some diﬀerences among the estimations (see the numbers in Table III) on
branching ratios for hadronic J/ψ → DP , DV decays. (i) The discrepancies among previous
works, although the same values of coeﬃcients a1,2 are taken, come mainly from diﬀerent

values of form factors. (ii) Considering the eﬀects of nonfactorizable vertex corrections, the

QCDF’s predictions on branching ratios agree basically with previous results, at least with

the same order magnitude. The QCDF’s results are generally in line with the numbers

in columns “C” and “D” within uncertainties, because the values of form factors in our

calculation is close to the average values of form factors used in columns “C” and “D”.

scrutiny of the QCDF’s results, it is interestingly found that there is an approximative re-

lationship among the branching ratios for decay modes with the same charmed ﬁnal state,
B(J/ψ→DV ) ≈ 5 B(J/ψ→DP ), where the pseudoscalar P and vector V mesons corresponds
to each other in the SU(3) q ¯q assignments of light mesons with the quark model, such as,

(3) There are many uncertainties on the QCDF’s results. (i) The ﬁrst uncertainty from

the CKM factors is small due to the high precision on Wolfenstein parameter λ with only

0.3% relative errors now[3]. The second uncertainty from the renormalization scale could,

in principle, be reduced by the inclusion of higher order αs corrections to hadronic matrix

elements, for example, it has been showed [54, 55] that tree amplitudes incorporating with

the NNLO vertex corrections are relatively less sensitive to the choice of scale than the
NLO amplitudes. The largest uncertainty (the fourth uncertainty), ∼ 40%, comes from the
transition form factors, which is expected to be cancelled from the relative ratio of branching

ratios, such as,

(ii) Uncertainties from other factors, such as the contributions of higher order αs corrections

to hadronic matrix elements, q2 dependence of form factors, the ﬁnal state interactions and

so on, which deserve the dedicated study, are not considered in this paper. So one should
not be too serious about the absolute size of the QCDF’s branching ratios for J/ψ → DM
decays which just provide an order of magnitude estimation.

IV. SUMMARY

In this paper, we present a phenomenological study on the nonleptonic J/ψ → DP , DV
weak decays with the QCDF approach. Our attention was ﬁxed on the nonfactorizable

contributions to hadronic matrix elements, while the weak transition form factors are taken

as nonperturbative parameters, which is diﬀerent from previous works [9, 19–23]. The values

of coeﬃcients a1,2 incorporating QCD radiative corrections agree well with those obtained

from the ﬁt on hadronic D weak decays [48, 49], which imply that the QCDF approach might
be valid for the J/ψ weak decays. Then the branching ratios of the exclusive J/ψ → DP ,
DV weak decays are estiamted. It is found that the QCDF’s predictions on branching ratios

are rough due to large uncertainties from input parameters, especially from form factors.
Despite this, we still can get some information about the J/ψ → DP , DV decays. For

11

example, the Cabibbo favored J/ψ → D−
branching ratios compared with other decay modes, which are promisingly detected at the

decays have relatively large

TABLE III: The branching ratios for J/ψ → DP , DV decay, The numbers in columns of Refs.[19, 22, 23] are calculated with coeﬃcients a1
= 1.26 and a2 = −0.51. The results of Ref.[19] are based on QCD sum rules. The numbers in columns of “A”, “B”, “C” and “D” are based
on BSW model with ﬂavor dependent ω, QCD inspired ω = αs × m, universal ω = 0.4 GeV and 0.5GeV, respectively. The uncertainties of
the “QCDF” column come from the CKM parameters, the renormalization scale µ = (1±0.2)mc, decay constants and Gegenbauer moments,
form factors, respectively.
