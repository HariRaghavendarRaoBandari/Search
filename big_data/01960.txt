MULTIPLICITY OF CRITICAL POINTS FOR THE

FRACTIONAL ALLEN-CAHN ENERGY

DAYANA PAGLIARDINI

Abstract. In this paper we study the fractional analogue of the Allen-Cahn
energy in bounded domains, and we show that it admits a number of critical
points which goes to inﬁnity as the perturbation parameter tends to zero.

1. Introduction

The problems involving fractional operators attracted great attention during
the last years. Indeed these problems appear in many areas such as optimization,
ﬁnance, crystal dislocation, minimal surfaces, water waves, fractional diﬀusion, (see
for example [8], [6], [3], [4], [7], [19], [18]). In particular, from a probabilistic point
of view, the fractional Laplacian is the inﬁnitesimal generator of a L´evy process,
see e.g. [2].

In this paper we present some existence and multiplicity results for critical points

of functionals of the form

(1)

Fε(u) = ZΩZΩ

|x − y|n+2s dxdy +

if s ∈ (1/2, 1),

where Ω is a smooth bounded domain of Rn, u ∈ H s(Ω; R), W ∈ C2(R; R+) is the
well known double well potential (see Section 2), and ε ∈ R+.

Fε is the fractional energy of the Allen-Cahn equation. It is the fractional coun-
terpart of the functionals studied by Modica-Mortola in [14], [15] where they proved
the Γ-convergence of the energy to De Giorgi’s perimeter. In the same way, func-
tionals (1), (2), (3) have been also considered by Valdinoci-Savin in [17], where it is
discussed their Γ-convergence.

Moreover, as proved in [13] for the functional

ZΩ

[ε|Du|2 + ε−1(u2 − 1)2] dx,

we expect that the solutions have interesting geometric properties related to the
interface minimality.

Some autors investigated multiplicity results of nontrivial solution for

ε2s(−∆)su + u = h(u)
u > 0
u = 0

on ∂Ω

in Ω




where Ω is a bounded domain in Rn, n > 2s, and h(u) has a subcritical growth (see
[12]), or for

(4)

(5)

ε2s(−∆)su + V (z)u = f (u)
u ∈ H s(Rn)
u(z) > 0

z ∈ Rn

in Rn, n > 2s




where the potential V : Rn → R and the nonlinearity f : R → R satisfy suitable
assumptions (see [11]).

Then Cabr´e and Sire in [5] studied the equation

(−∆)su + G′(u) = 0 in Rn

where G denotes the potential associated to a nonlinearity f , and they proved
existence, uniqness and qualitative properties of solutions.

Indeed, Passaseo in [16] studied the analogue of our functional, with the classical

Laplacian instead of the fractional one, i.e

(6)

fε(u) = εZΩ

|Du|2 dx +

1

ε ZΩ

G(u) dx

where Ω is a bounded domain of Rn, u ∈ H 1,2(Ω; R), G ∈ C2(R; R+) is a nonnega-
tive function having exactly two zeros, α and β, and ε is a positive parameter: he
proved that the number of critical points for fε goes to ∞ as ε → 0.

Passaseo was motivated by De Giorgi’s idea, contained in [9], i.e. if uε → u0 in
L1(Ω) as ε → 0 and limε→0 fε(uε) < ∞, then the function Uε(t), deﬁned as steepest
descent curves for fε starting from uε, converge to a curve U0(t) in L1(Ω) such that
U0(t) is a function with values in {α, β} for every t ≥ 0 and the interface between
the sets Et = {x ∈ Ω : U0(t)(x) = α} and Ω \ Et moves by mean curvature. As a
consequence the critical points uε of fε which satisfy

(7)

lim inf
ε→∞

fε(uε) < +∞

converge in L1(Ω) to a function u0 taking values in {α, β}. De Giorgi considered
also the problem of existence and multiplicity for nontrivial critical points of fε
with the property (7), and Passaseo’s critical points verify this property and

lim inf
ε→∞

fε(uε) > 0,

so he can say that u0 is nontrivial.

In this paper we want to extend Passaseo’s results by replacing the function
G in (6) with the double well potential W , and Passaseo’s functional fε with its
fractional counterpart.

The paper is organized as follow:

in the Section 2 we give some preliminaries
deﬁnitions and results. In the Section 3, we deﬁne suitable functions and sets, then
most of the work is dedicated to prove nonlocal estimates needful to obtain the
bound from above of Fε, (see Lemma 3.5), and the (PS)-condition, Lemma 3.7. In
fact in particular for the ﬁrst of these results, we had to split the domain in two
types of regions and estimate Fε in the three possible interactions.

CRITICAL POINTS OF THE ALLEN-CAHN ENERGY

Finally, after recalling a technical result, Lemma 3.6, we can apply a classical
Krasnoselsii’s genus tool to show the existence and multiplicity results for solutions.
Hence, knowing that minimizers of Fε Γ-converge to minimizers of the area
functional, we hope that also min-max solutions can pass to the limit as ε → 0 in
a suitable sense, producing critical points of positive index for local, if s ∈ [1/2, 1),
or nonlocal, if s ∈ (0, 1/2), area functional.

2. Notation and preliminary results

In this section we introduce the framework that we will be used throughout the

paper.

Let Ω be a bounded domain of Rn, denote by |Ω| its Lebesgue measure and

consider W the double well potential, that is

(8)

W : R → [0, +∞)

W ∈ C2(R, R+)

W > 0 in (−1, 1)

W ′(±1) = 0

W (±1) = 0
W ′′(±1) > 0.

Now we ﬁx the fractional exponent s ∈ (0, 1). For any p ∈ [1, +∞), we deﬁne

W s,p(Ω) := nu ∈ Lp(Ω) :

|u(x) − u(y)|

|x − y|s+n/p ∈ Lp(Ω × Ω)o;

i.e. an intermediary Banach space between Lp(Ω) and W 1,p(Ω), endowed with the
natural norm

kukW s,p(Ω) := (cid:16)ZΩ

|u|p dx +ZΩZΩ

|u(x) − u(y)|p

|x − y|n+sp dxdy(cid:17)1/p

.

If p = 2 we deﬁne W s,2(Ω) = H s(Ω) and it is a Hilbert space. Now let S ′(Rn) be
the set of all temperated distributions, that is the topological dual of S (Rn). As
usual, for any ϕ ∈ S (Rn), we denote by

F ϕ(ξ) =

1

(2π)n/2 ZRn

e−iξ·xϕ(x) dx

the Fourier transform of ϕ and we recall that one can extend F from S (Rn) to
S ′(Rn). At this point we can deﬁne, for any u ∈ S (Rn) and s ∈ (0, 1), the
fractional Laplacian operator as

(−∆)su(x) = C(n, s)P.V.ZRn

u(x) − u(y)
|x − y|n+2s dy.

Here P.V. stands for the Cauchy principal value and C(n, s) is a normalizing con-
stant (see [10] for more details). It is easy to prove that this deﬁnition is equivalent
to the following two:

(−∆)su(x) = −

1
2

C(n, s)ZRn

u(x + y) + u(x − y) − 2u(x)

|y|n+2s

dy ∀ x ∈ Rn,

and

(−∆)su(x) = F −1(|ξ|2s(F u)) ∀ξ ∈ Rn.

Now we remember some embedding’s results for the fractional spaces:

4

DAYANA PAGLIARDINI

Proposition 2.1. [10] Let p ∈ [1, +∞) and 0 < s ≤ s′ ≤ 1. Let Ω be an open
set of Rn and u : Ω → R be a measurable function. Then W s′,p(Ω) is continuously
embedded in W s,p(Ω), denoted by W s′,p(Ω) ֒→ W s,p(Ω), and the following inequality
holds

kukW s,p(Ω) ≤ CkukW s′ ,p(Ω)
for some suitable positive constant C = C(n, s, p) ≥ 1.

Moreover, if also Ω is an open set of Rn of class C0,1 with bounded boundary,

then W 1,p(Ω) ֒→ W s,p(Ω) and we have

for some suitable positive constant C = C(n, s, p) ≥ 1.

kukW s,p(Ω) ≤ CkukW 1,p(Ω)

Deﬁnition 2.2. [10] For any s ∈ (0, 1) and any p ∈ [1, +∞), we say that an open
set Ω ⊆ Rn is an extension domain for W s,p if there exists a positive constant C =
C(n, p, s, Ω) such that: for every function u ∈ W s,p(Ω) there exists ˜u ∈ W s,p(Rn)
with ˜u(x) = u(x) for all x ∈ Ω and k˜ukW s,p(Rn) ≤ CkukW s,p(Ω).

Theorem 2.3. [10] Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) be such that sp < n. Let
q ∈ [1, p∗), where p∗ = p∗(n, s) = np/(n − sp) is the so-called “fractional critical
exponent”. Let Ω ⊆ Rn be a bounded extension domain for W s,p and I be a
bounded subset of Lp(Ω). Suppose that

sup

f ∈I ZΩZΩ

|f (x) − f (y)|p
|x − y|n+sp dxdy < ∞.

Then I is pre-compact in Lq(Ω).

We remind also the notion of Krasnoselskii’s genus, useful in the sequel:

Deﬁnition 2.4. [1] Let H be a Hilbert space and E be a closed subset of H \ {0},
symmetric with respect to 0 (i.e. E = −E).

We call genus of E in H, indicated with genH (E), the least integer m such that

there exists φ ∈ C(H; R) such that φ is odd and φ(x) 6= 0 for all x ∈ E.

We set genH (E) = +∞ if there are no integer with the above property and

genH (∅) = 0.

It is well known that genH (Sk) = k + 1 if Sk is a k-dimensional sphere of H with

centre in zero.

Finally we recall a well known result:

Theorem 2.5. [1] Let H be a Hilbert space and f : H → R be an even C2-
functional satisfying the following Palais-Smale condition: given a sequence (ui)i
in H such that the sequence (f (ui))i is bounded and f ′(ui) → 0, (ui)i is relatively
compact in H.

Set f c = {u ∈ H : f (u) ≤ c}, ∀ c ∈ R. Then, ∀ c1, c2 ∈ R, such that c1 ≤ c2 <

f (0), we have

(9)

genH (f c2) ≤ genH (f c1) + #{(−ui, ui) : c1 ≤ f (ui) ≤ c2, f ′(ui) = 0},

where, if A is a set, we indicate with #A the cardinality of A.

From now on we consider H s(Ω) as Hilbert space and we shall write simply
gen(E) instead of genHs(Ω)(E); then we refer to the Palais-Smale condition with
the symbol (P S)-condition.

3. Multiplicity of critical points

Let us start enouncing the fundamental result of the paper:

Theorem 3.1. Let Ω be a smooth bounded domain of Rn and W be a function
verifying condition (8). Then there exist two sequences of positive numbers (εk)k,
(ck)k such that for every ε ∈ (0, εk), the functional Fε has at least k pairs

(−u1,ε, u1,ε), . . . , (−uk,ε, uk,ε)

of critical points, all of them diﬀerent from the costant pair (−1, 1) satisfying

−1 ≤ ui,ε(x) ≤ 1 ∀ x ∈ Ω,

∀ ε ∈ (0, εk),

∀ i = 1, . . . k,

and

Fε(ui,ε) ≤ ck ∀ ε ∈ (0, εk),

∀ i = 1, . . . , k.

Moreover, ∀ ε ∈ (0, εk) and ∀ i = 1, . . . , k we have

(10) Fε(u) ≥ min(cid:26)Fε(u) : u ∈ H s(Ω), −1 ≤ u(x) ≤ 1 ∀ x ∈ Ω,ZΩ

u dx = 0(cid:27) .

Remark 3.2. The constant function u ≡ 0 is obviously a critical point for the
functional Fε for every ε > 0 but it is not included among the ones given by
Theorem 3.1. Instead if s ∈ (1/2, 1), but for the other cases it is similar,

Fε(0) =

1
ε

W (0)|Ω| → +∞ as ε → 0.

Moreover, since inf{W (t) : W ′(t) = 0, −1 < t < 1} > 0, then one can say that

the critical points given by Theorem 3.1 are not constant functions.

In fact, if uε = cε is a costant critical point for Fε (distinct from −1 and 1), it

must be W ′(cε) = 0 and −1 < cε < 1, and therefore

(11)

W (cε) ≥ inf{W (t) : W ′(t) = 0, −1 < t < 1} > 0

and so, for example by considering the functional related to s ∈ (1/2, 1), but the
other cases are similar,

(12)

Fε(cε) =

1
ε

W (cε)|Ω| → +∞ as ε → 0,

in contradiction with Fε(cε) ≤ ck ∀ ε ∈ (0, εk).

Notice that ∀ε > 0,

(13)

min(cid:26)Fε(u) : u ∈ H s(Ω), −1 ≤ u(x) ≤ 1 ∀x ∈ Ω,ZΩ

u dx = 0(cid:27) > 0

if we assume, without loss of generality, that Ω is a connected domain.
In fact, let ¯u be a minimizing function; if we assume Fε(¯u) = 0, then

ZΩZΩ

|¯u(x) − ¯u(y)|2
|x − y|n+2s dxdy ≡ 0

and W (¯u) ≡ 0. Therefore we must have ¯u ≡ 0 in contradiction with W (0) > 0.

Deﬁnition 3.3. Let k be a ﬁxed positive integer; for every λ = (λ(0), . . . , λ(k)) ∈
Rk+1 deﬁne the function ϕλ : R → R by

ϕλ(t) =

k

Xm=0

λ(m) cos(mt).

For every λ ∈ Rk+1 with |λ|Rk+1 = 1 and ε > 0, let Lε(ϕλ) : R → R be the

function deﬁned by

Lε(ϕλ)(t) =

1

2ε Z t+ε

t−ε

ϕλ(τ )
|ϕλ(τ )|

dτ ;

notice that Lε(ϕλ) is well deﬁned because ϕλ has only isolated zeros ∀ λ ∈ Rk+1
with |λ|Rk+1 = 1.

For every x = (x1, · · · , xn) ∈ Ω ⊂ Rn we consider the projection onto the ﬁrst

component, P1(x) = x1, and the set

Sk
ε = {Lε(ϕλ) ◦ P1 : λ ∈ Rk+1, |λ|Rk+1 = 1}.

Lemma 3.4. Let us ﬁx a, b ∈ R with a < b and set

χ(ϕλ) = #{t ∈ [a, b] : ϕλ(t) = 0}

for every λ ∈ Rk+1 with |λ|Rk+1 = 1. Then for every k ∈ N it results:

sup{χ(ϕλ) : λ ∈ Rk+1, |λ|Rk+1 = 1} < +∞.

Proof. Let us remark that for every λ ∈ Rk+1 with |λ|Rk+1 = 1, the function ϕλ
can have only isolated zeros, because, otherwise, it should be identically zero in
R, which is impossible since the functions cos(mt) (m = 0, 1, . . . , k) are linearly
independent.
Therefore

χ(ϕλ) < +∞ ∀ λ ∈ Rk+1 with |λ|Rk+1 = 1.

Now suppose by contradiction that

sup{χ(ϕλ) : λ ∈ Rk+1, |λ|Rk+1 = 1} = +∞,

i.e. there exists a sequence (λi)i in Rk+1, with |λi|Rk+1 = 1 ∀ i ∈ N, such that
limi→∞ χ(ϕλi ) = +∞. We can assume that (up to subsequences) λi → ˜λ in Rk+1;
so ϕλi → ϕ˜λ uniformly in R. Set

and, for every ε > 0,

˜Z = {t ∈ [a, b] : ϕ˜λ(t) = 0}

˜Zε = {t ∈ R : dist(t, ˜Z) < ε}.

Since min{|ϕ˜λ(t)| : t ∈ ([a, b] \ ˜Zε)} > 0 ∀ ε > 0 and ϕλi → ϕ˜λ uniformly in R,

for every ε > 0 there exists j(ε) ∈ N such that

that is

min{|ϕλi (t)| : t ∈ ([a, b] \ ˜Zε)} > 0 ∀ i > j(ε),

{t ∈ [a, b] : ϕλi (t) = 0} ⊂ ˜Zε

∀ i > j(ε).

CRITICAL POINTS OF THE ALLEN-CAHN ENERGY

7

Since χ(ϕ˜λ) < +∞ and limi→∞ χ(ϕλi ) = +∞, we deduce that there exists ˜t ∈ ˜Z
such that (up to subsequences) we have:

lim
i→∞

#{t ∈ [˜t − ε, ˜t + ε] : ϕλi = 0} = +∞.

It follows that there exists a sequence (jh)h in N such that for every i > jh there
i,ε ) = 0, where Dh denote the

i,ε ∈ [˜t − ε, ˜t + ε] which satisﬁes Dhϕλi (˜t(h)

exists ˜t(h)
h-order derivative.

We can assume that (up to subsequences) limi→∞ ˜t(h)
ε ∈ [˜t−ε, ˜t+ε] such that Dhϕ˜λ(˜t(h)

∀ h ∈ N there exists ˜t(h)
0 and so, as ε → 0, we obtain

ε

i,ε = ˜t(h)
ε ) = limi→∞ Dhϕλi (˜t(h)

. Hence, ∀ ε > 0 and
i,ε ) =

Dhϕ˜λ(˜t) = 0

∀ h ∈ N

which implies that ϕ˜λ ≡ 0. But this is a contradiction because |˜λ|Rk+1 = 1.
Lemma 3.5. Let Ω be a bounded domain of Rn and W be a function verifying (8).
Then, for every k ∈ N there exists a positive constant ck such that

(cid:3)

(14)

max Fε(f ) ≤ ck ∀f ∈ Sk
ε .

Proof. Let uλ,ε = Lε(ϕλ) ◦ P1 ∈ Sk

ε and set

a = inf P1(Ω),
b = sup P1(Ω),

Zλ = {t ∈ [a, b] : ϕλ(t) = 0},

Zλ,ε = {t ∈ R : dist(t, Zλ) < ε}.

Notice that

(i) If P1(x) /∈ Zλ,ε, then |uλ,ε(x)| = 1 and Duλ,ε(x) = 0, while

(ii) if P1(x) ∈ Zλ,ε, then |uλ,ε(x)| ≤ 1 and |Duλ,ε(x)| ≤

1
ε

.

Since Ω is bounded, we can suppose it is included in a cube Q of side large
λ,ε the complement to Zλ,ε, then we have to

enough. We will denote with Yλ,ε = Z C
distinguish three cases:

a) if x ∈ Yλ,ε and y ∈ Yλ,ε;

b) if x ∈ Zλ,ε and y ∈ Yλ,ε;

c) if x ∈ Zλ,ε and y ∈ Zλ,ε.

We set k = max{χ(ϕλ) : λ ∈ Rk+1, |λ|Rk+1 = 1}, then

while if we set ρ = sup{|x| : x ∈ Ω}, M = max{W (t) : |t| ≤ 1} and denote by ωn−1

Now we show a technical lemma, that we will use to prove our main result:

Lemma 3.6. For every ε > 0 and k ∈ N the set Sk

ε veriﬁes the following properties:

ε is a compact subset of H s(Ω);
ε = −Sk
ε ;

a) Sk
b) Sk
c) ∀ k ∈ N there exists ¯εk > 0 such that 0 /∈ Sk
ε
d) ∀ k ∈ N and ∀ ε > 0 such that 0 /∈ Sk

∀ ε ∈ (0, ¯εk);

ε , it results gen(Sk

ε ) ≥ k + 1.

Proof. The points b), c) and d) are proved in [16]. For a) we use Lemma 2.8 of
[16] and the continuous embedding of H 1(Ω) in H s(Ω) ∀ s ∈ (0, 1), see Proposition
2.1.
(cid:3)

Before proving the main theorem of this work, we point out a useful property of

Fε:

Lemma 3.7. Functionals (1), (2), (3) satisfy the (P S)-condition.

CRITICAL POINTS OF THE ALLEN-CAHN ENERGY

Proof. We will prove the lemma for s ∈ (1/2, 1) being the other cases analogue.

If W is quadratic, in particular there exist α, β > 0 such that

(27)

W (u) ≥ αu + β ∀ u ∈ R.

Since (Fε(un))n is bounded, (27) implies that also kunkHs(Ω) is bounded, hence

un ⇀ u in H s(Ω), un → u in Lq, ∀ q ∈ h1, 2∗ =
We claim that u is a critical point of Fε. In fact ∀ v ∈ H s(Ω)

therefore un → u a.e. x ∈ Ω.

and the second term on the right hand side goes to 0. In particular we obtain

Hence kunkHs(Ω) → kukHs(Ω) and since un ⇀ u in H s(Ω), we have the thesis. (cid:3)

We are now able to prove our main result

Proof of Theorem 3.1. As usual we will prove the theorem only for s ∈ (1/2, 1).

Consider W ∈ C2(R; R+) another even function, which satisﬁes the following

properties:

W = W ∀t ∈ [−1, 1];

We prove now that for every critical point u ∈ H s(Ω) which is a critical point
for the functional F ε, it results |u(x)| ≤ 1 ∀x ∈ Ω, and so u is a critical point for
the functional Fε too: indeed we have ∀ v ∈ H s(Ω)

Let εk > 0 be such that εk <

W (0)|Ω|, where ck is the constant introduced in

Lemma 3.5. Then, for every ε ∈ (0, εk) we can apply Theorem 2.5 to the functional

F ε with c1 < 0 and c2 = ck, because F ε(0) =

W (0)|Ω| > ck ∀ ε ∈ (0, εk). In

this way we can prove that for every ε ∈ (0, εk), F ε has at least (k + 1) pairs
(−u0,ε, u0,ε), . . . , (−uk,ε, uk,ε) of critical points with F ε(ui,ε) ≤ ck ∀ i = 0, 1, . . . , k.
ε ⊆
In fact gen(F

ε ⊆ H s(Ω) \ {0}.
Notice that these (k + 1) pairs of critical points include also the one constitued

c1
ε ) =gen(∅) = 0, while gen(F

ck
ε ) ≥gen(Sk

by the minimizers ±1; so we can assume that (−u0,ε, u0,ε) = (−1, +1).

On the contrary, the other solutions are not minimizers for the functional F ε if

Ω is a connected domain. Indeed it results

F ε(ui,ε) > 0

∀ ε ∈ (0, εk) and ∀ i = 0, 1, . . . , k

because if Fε(ui,ε) = F ε(ui,ε) = 0, then we should have

ZΩZΩ

|ui,ε(x) − ui,ε(y)|2

|x − y|n+2s

dxdy = 0

and W (ui,ε) ≡ 0

in Ω

and so ui,ε should be a constant function with value +1 or −1.

Moreover let us remark that ∀ ε ∈ (0, εk) and ∀ i = 1, . . . k we have

(32)

Fε(ui,ε) ≥ min(cid:26)F ε(u) : u ∈ H s(Ω),ZΩ

u dx = 0(cid:27) .

CRITICAL POINTS OF THE ALLEN-CAHN ENERGY

In fact, assume that

min(cid:26)F ε(u) : u ∈ H s(Ω),ZΩ

u dx = 0(cid:27) > 0,

otherwise (32) would be obvious. Then, for every c1 > 0 such that

c1 < min(cid:26)F ε(u) : u ∈ H s(Ω),ZΩ

u dx = 0(cid:27) ,

c1
ε ) = 1 because below c1 the mean is non zero and we
we would have clearly gen(F
can use it as odd function into R1 in the genus deﬁnition, see Deﬁnition 2.4; thus,
if (32) was false, the solutions would belong to a set of genus one, in contradiction
with respect their costruction in Theorem 2.5.

Now, in order to prove (10), let us replace the function W appearing in the
j
deﬁnition of functional F ε by a sequence of functions (W j)j and denote by (F
ε)j
the corresponding sequence of new functionals. Assume moreover that the functions
W j satisfy the same properties as W for all j ∈ N and that

(33)

lim
j→∞

W j(t) = +∞ for

|t| > 1.

Then property (32) holds for the higher critical values of the functional F

all j ∈ N and so (10) follows for j large enough, taking into account that

u dx = 0(cid:27)

because of (33).

u dx = 0(cid:27)
