Excitonic eﬀects due to electron-hole coupling play a fundamental role in renormalising energy
levels in dye sensitised and organic solar cells determining the driving force for electron extraction.
We show that ﬁrst-principles calculations based on many-body perturbation theory within the GW-
BSE approach provide a quantitative picture of interfacial excited state energetics in organic dye-
sensitized TiO2, delivering a general rule for evaluating relevant energy levels.To perform GW-BSE
calculations in such large systems we introduce a new scheme based on maximally localized Wannier’s
functions. With this method the overall scaling of GW-BSE calculations is reduced from O(N4) to
O(N3).

Excitonic eﬀects due to electron-hole coupling play a
fundamental role in renormalising energy levels in dye
sensitised and organic solar cells determining the driving
force for electron extraction. In particular, dye-sensitised
solar cells (DSSCs) [1] are one of the most promising tech-
nologies for clean energy production. Although currently
commercialized only for niche applications, they are im-
portant as prototypical cells sharing several features with
organic and perovskite solar cells[2, 3].

In DSSCs a semi-conducting oxide (typically meso or
nano structured TiO2 ) supports a layer of adsorbed dye
molecules. The oxide is in contact with a transparent
conductive oxide (TCO) and the dye molecules are in
contact with a hole transporting medium which can be a
polymeric solid or a redox couple in a liquid electrolyte
(see Fig. 1). When a photon is adsorbed by the dye, one
of its valence electrons is promoted to an empty level.
Provided that its energy is higher than the TiO2 con-
duction band minimum (CBM), it can be injected into
the TiO2 and travel towards the electrode leaving a hole
in the dye. This can be eventually neutralised provided
that its energy level is lower than that of the redox cou-
ple. Therefore the functioning of such a device crucially
relies on the alignment among the energy levels of its
components (Fig. 1). These refer to both charged exci-
tations (as TiO2 band edges) and neutral excitations (as
the dye optical gap).

Density functional theory (DFT) is nowadays the stan-
dard approach for the modelling of complex systems as
DSSCs providing an accurate description of the atomistic
structure. Unfortunately, energy levels can be only ap-
proximately reproduced by DFT due to issues related to
the well-known band-gap underestimation [4].

Many-body perturbation theory approaches (MBPT)
can overcome these issues[5]. Recently, the GW method

illustrates the atomic structure of the model TiO2 cluster sen-
sitised with the organic JK2 dye studied here. The main en-
ergy levels are: (D/D+) dye ground state ionisation potential,
(D∗/D*+) dye excited state ionisation potential, (CBM) TiO2
conduction band minimum, (VBM) TiO2 valence band max-
imum, (REDOX) level of the redox couple. Voc is the open
circuit volage of the cell.

[6, 7], in which the electronic self-energy is expressed as
the product of the one-particle Green’s function G with
the screened Coulomb interaction W , has been applied to
models of DSSCs leading to the successful prediction of
open-circuit voltages[8, 9]. However, the GW approach is
appropriate only for the evaluation of charged excitations
as it does not take into account electron-hole interactions.
This is a major drawback for the calculation of the energy
levels of the excited dye and even more severe for those
of dye-sensitised semiconductors.

Electron-hole interactions are introduced into the ﬁrst-

equation (BSE) approach which gives access to excitonic
energies and amplitudes [10, 11]. However, the high com-
putational cost of BSE approaches and in particular the
N 4 scaling hinders their application to large model struc-
tures as those required for treating DSSCs.

Here, we introduce a BSE method which allows much
faster calculations on large systems thanks to a favorable
N 3 scaling with respect to the system size. Indeed, we
express the excitonic amplitudes as a set of excitations
in correspondence with the maximally localised Wan-
nier’s functions [12] which deﬁne the manifold of occupied
states. In this way, we can avoid the calculation in the
BSE equation of terms related to non-overlapping Wan-
nier’s functions, avoiding at the same time any explicit
sum over empty one-particle DFT orbitals[13]. First, we
validate our method addressing the relatively small C60
molecule. Then, we apply it to a large model of a DSSC
comprising the all-organic JK2 [14] dye adsorbed on a
TiO2 cluster.

The MBPT formalism gives a BSE in which a
Hamiltonian-like operator ˆH eh [11] accounts for the
electron-hole interactions. Excitation energies ΩS and
amplitudes Θ are obtained solving:

ˆH eh |Θ(cid:105) = ΩS |Θ(cid:105)

(1)

(cid:88)

In the Tamm-Dancoﬀ approximation the amplitudes Θ
can be expanded in terms of valence (occupied) ψv and
conduction (empty) ψc one-particle orbitals[11]:

Θ (r, r(cid:48)) =

Avcψ∗

v (r) ψc (r(cid:48))

(2)

vc

and, if only (optically allowed) spin-singlet solutions are
considered, ˆH eh becomes:

ˆH eh = ˆD + 2 ˆK x + ˆK d

(3)

where ˆD is the diagonal term, ˆK x is the exchange and
ˆK d is the direct one[11].

In Ref.[13], the approach which permits TD-DFT cal-
culations avoiding explicit sums over empty one-particle
orbitals[15], has been extended to the BSE case. Indeed,
the excitonic amplitudes are expressed avoiding any ex-
plicit reference to empty orbitals:

Θ (r, r(cid:48)) =

ψ∗
v (r) ξv (r(cid:48))

(4)

v

where the functions ξv belong to the manifold of the
empty one-particle orbitals. We indicate with Nv the
number of occupied orbitals. The evaluation of the di-
agonal term involves Nv applications of the one-particle
Hamiltonian with an overall scaling of N 3 with respect

(cid:88)

2

to the generic size N of the system. Also the scaling of
the exchange term is N 3, while that of the direct term
is N 4. We can now take advantage of representing the
excitonic amplitudes in terms of valence Wannier’s func-
v(cid:48) Uvv(cid:48)ψv(cid:48). The unitary transformation

tions [12] wv =(cid:80)

U acts on the functions ξ in this way:

˜ξv =

U∗
v(cid:48)vξv(cid:48)

(5)

this together with the assumption of real maximally lo-
calised Wannier’s functions assures that:

(cid:88)

v(cid:48)

(cid:88)

Θ (r, r(cid:48)) =

wv (r) ˜ξv (r(cid:48))

v

(6)

This permits to neglect in the evaluation of ˆK d the cal-
culation of terms involving products of non-overlapping
Wannier’s functions. We indicate with s the threshold
which determines whether two Wannier’s function wv and
wv(cid:48) overlap:

ˆ

|wv (r)|2 |wv(cid:48) (r)|2 dr > s

(7)

Customarily, the ˆK d operator is expressed as the sum
of the bare ˆK d,v and correlation ˆK d,c parts. The ˆK d,v
operator acts on the Θ excitonic state in the following

way:(cid:104) ˆK d,vΘ

(cid:105)

(r, r(cid:48)) =

ˆ

(8)

(cid:88)
(cid:88)

v

v(cid:48)

where v is the bare Coulomb interaction and Pc is the

projector on the manifold of empty DFT orbitals:

Pc (r, r(cid:48)) = δ (r − r(cid:48)) −(cid:88)

v

and we use the following deﬁnition:

wv (r) wv (r(cid:48))

(9)

(vwvwv(cid:48)) (r) =

dr(cid:48)v (r, r(cid:48)) wv (r(cid:48)) wv(cid:48) (r(cid:48))

(10)

In Eq. 8 sums over the v(cid:48) index are restricted by the
overlap condition of Eq. 7. For evaluating how the ˆK d,c
term acts on an excitonic state Θ we write the correlation
part of the static screened Coulomb interaction as:

Wc (r, r(cid:48)) =

(vΦµ) (r) Πµν (vΦ∗

ν) (r(cid:48))

(11)

ˆ

(cid:88)

µν

where {Φµ} is an appropriate basis set for the represen-
tation of the reducible polarisability Π, and the following
deﬁnition is used:

ˆ

(vΦµ) (r) =

dr(cid:48)v (r, r(cid:48)) Φµ (r(cid:48))

(12)

The ˆK d,c operator acts on the Θ excitonic state in the

following way:

(cid:104) ˆK d,cΘ

(cid:105)

(r, r(cid:48)) =

(cid:88)
(cid:88)

v

v(cid:48)µ

wv (r)

dr(cid:48)(cid:48)Pc (r(cid:48), r(cid:48)(cid:48)) ×

˜ζv(cid:48) (r(cid:48)(cid:48)) (vΦµ) (r(cid:48)(cid:48)) Z v
v(cid:48)µ

(13)

where the Z v

v(cid:48)µ terms read:

(cid:88)

ˆ

Z v

v(cid:48)µ =

Πµν

dr (vφ∗

ν) (r) wv (r) wv(cid:48) (r)

(14)

ν

(cid:80)

also in this case only the v, v(cid:48) couples satisfying Eq.
7 are retained.
It is worth noting that the terms
v(cid:48)µ do not depend on the ˜ζ(cid:48)s so that they
µ (vΦµ) (r) Z v
can be evaluated at once at the beginning of the calcula-
tion. In this way the resulting scaling for the entire ˆK d
term is reduced to N 3.

We have implemented our method as a module of
the Quantum-Espresso (Q-E) DFT package[16] which
is based on the plane-waves pseudopotentials paradigm.
We sample the Brillouin’s zone at the sole Γ point and
we can treat both extended and isolated systems. Quasi-
particle energies are taken from a GW calculation for a
set of conduction and valence states while for the residual
states we apply to the DFT ones a scissor operator [13].
The static screened Coulomb interaction is provided by
a GW calculation performed with the GWL code which
overcomes the problem of sums over empty states[17, 18].
Maximally localised Wannier’s function are obtained us-
ing the algorithm described in Ref. [19]. Single excitonic
states can be calculated through a conjugate gradient
minimization while the complex dielectric function can
be directly evaluated through a Lanczos series[20].

First, we validated our method considering the isolated
benzene molecule comparing the ﬁrst excitonic energies
with those calculated with the Yambo code [21] starting
from the same Q-E DFT. We ﬁnd that values from the
two calculations agree within 0.1 eV.

We then applied our BSE scheme to address the iso-
lated C60 molecule. We take the atomic coordinates from
Ref.
[22] and choose the PBE exchange and correlation
functional [23] for the starting DFT calculation together
with a norm-conserving pseudo-potential [24]. The cubic
simulation cell has an edge of 40 Bohr and the Coulomb
interaction is truncated at 20 Bohr.
[22] we
investigated the GW quasi-particle energy levels ﬁnding

a self-consistent HOMO-LUMO (electronic) gap of 4.94
eV (1.78 eV at the PBE level) and we consider the cor-
responding scissor operator in the BSE calculation. A
basis of 2000 elements is used for representing the static
polarisability operator [17, 18].

As C60 exhibits 120 doubly occupied valence states the
maximum number of product terms is 14400. We ob-
served that a large threshold s of 500 a.u., corresponding
to only 180 product terms, was suﬃcient for converging
the optical gap Eg to the ﬁnal value of 1.75 eV. This is
in good agreement with the experimental ﬁgures of 1.92
eV (solution) and of 1.87 eV (bulk solid) [25] and with
a previous BSE value of 1.88 eV[26] which takes into ac-
count vertex eﬀects neglected here. The same extremely
fast convergence with s is observed for the optical ab-
sorption spectrum reported in Fig. 2. Also in this case
a threshold s = 500 a.u. yields almost undistinguishable
results from a s = 0 a.u. calculation involving all possi-
ble product terms. We notice also good agreement with
experimental data in solution [27] for the position and
relative intensities of the main features.

We can now apply our GW-BSE approach for evaluat-
ing the key energy levels in a DSSC model. We considered
the same JK2@TiO2 model structure of Ref. [28] exhibit-
ing a dye molecule adsorbed on an anatase TiO2 cluster
(32 TiO2 units) comprising 204 atoms and 1174 valence
electrons in a 35× 35× 66.5 Bohr3 periodic orthorhombic
simulation cell. DFT calculations are performed using
the BLYP exchange and correlation functional [29] and
wavefunctions are expanded on a plane waves basis set
deﬁned by a cutoﬀ energy of 150 Ry. For the GW and
the BSE calculations the polarisability operators are ex-
panded on a (minimal) optimal basis set [18] comprising
2500 vectors corresponding to an estimated accuracy for
the GW energy levels of ∼ 0.2 eV [30]. The BSE cal-
culation has been performed using thresholds down to
s = 10 a.u. The optical gap Egap is determined through
the position of the ﬁrst peak in the calculated optical
absorption spectrum consistently with the reported ex-

In Fig. 3 and Tab.

It is worth stressing that applying our new method a
BSE calculation performed on such a large system was
made possible even with quite restricted computational
resources [31]. Indeed, for the JK2@TiO2 system the to-
tal number of possible Wannier’s functions products is
huge (344569).
I, we show that
only a fraction of these products is required for assuring
good convergence while the cost for evaluating the ˆK d
term of the excitonic Hamiltonian scales almost linearly
with such number[32]. Indeed, a threshold s = 500 a.u.,
corresponding to ∼ 4 product terms for each Wannier’s
function, leads to pretty well converged results. Consid-
ering all the possible Wannier’s functions products would
require a ∼ 150 times longer computation together with
much more severe requirements in terms of memory us-
age.

In analogy with Refs. [8, 9], the dye D/D+ level (ne-

glecting any structural relaxation) is given by the upper-
most occupied GW energy level with dye character which
corresponds also to the HOMO of the entire JK2@TiO2
system. The D∗/D∗+ level is the excited state ionisation
potential of the adsorbed dye which can be obtained from
the D/D+ level adding the BSE lowest bright (singlet)
excitation energy of the adsorbed dye. The evaluation of
the TiO2 CBM is more delicate. Indeed, the electronic
VBM-CBM gap converges very slowly towards the bulk
value when calculated on slabs or clusters of increasing
size. Moreover, this issue is more severe for the GW ap-
proach [33]. However, we previously found that the abso-
lute position of the VBM in anatase TiO2 slabs converges
faster with respect to slab width and is in agreement with
available experimental data [34]. This is related to the
localisation of the manifold of occupied states. Hence,
a good estimate for the TiO2 CBM can be obtained by
adding to the VBM value, calculated for the cluster, the
electronic band gap of bulk anatase TiO2 from an equiv-
alent GW calculation for a bulk model structure (3.6 eV
[8]).

As displayed in Tab. II the GW-BSE energy levels are
in a quite good agreement with experiment even without
considering any solvent eﬀect. These can be estimated
considering the shift of the energy levels at the sole DFT
BLYP level using an implicit solvent model. This further
increases the quality of the GW-BSE results showing that
the GW-BSE approach can predict at the same time both
charged and neutral energy levels.

In conclusion, we presented a method which permits to
extend the scope of state of the art BSE calculations even
using limited computational resources. The accuracy is
controlled by a single parameter with a clear physical
meaning (i.e. deﬁning the overlap of Wannier’s func-
tions). Moreover, its formulation is general and can be
extended towards other applications as TD-DFT. Fur-
ther speed-up could be obtained restricting integrals in
real space only to the volumes where Wannier’s functions
are not vanishing.

This permitted us to solve the problem of energy level
alignment in JK2@TiO2 opening the way to the use of
BSE for addressing complex systems in the modelling of
photovoltaics and optoelectronic materials where ordi-
nary approaches fail.
