Despite of its huge successes in total energy related applications, the Kohn-Sham scheme of
density functional theory (DFT-Kohn-Sham) cannot get reliable single particle excitation energies
for solids.
In particular, it has not been able to calculate the ionization potential (IP), one of
the most important material parameters, for semiconductors. We illustrate that an approximate
exchange-only optimized eﬀective potential (EXX-OEP), the Becke-Johnson exchange, can be used
to largely solve this long-standing problem. For a group of 17 semiconductors, we have obtained
the IP’s to similar accuracy as the much more sophisticated GW approximation (GWA), with the
computational cost of only LDA/GGA. The EXX-OEP, therefore, is likely as useful for solids as
for ﬁnite systems. For solid surfaces, the asymptotic behavior of the vxc has similar eﬀects as for
ﬁnite systems which, when neglected, typically causes the semiconductor IP’s to be underestimated
by about 0.2 eV. This may partially explain why standard GWA systematically underestimates the
IP’s, and why using the same GWA procedures has not been able to get accurate IP and band gap
at the same time.

The ionization potential of a semiconductor is one of
the most important material parameters which governs
its optics, transport, electrochemistry and interface prop-
erties in hetero-structures, etc. Although in principle the
IP can be calculated by the many-body Green’s function
method in GW approximation (GWA)1, due to the heavy
computational cost, in practice further approximations
have to be made which has remained unjustiﬁed to this
date. For ﬁnite systems, it is usually more convenient
to use density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the
neutral and ionized systems separately, and then obtain
accurate IP from their total energy diﬀerence. This ap-
proach, however, cannot be used for inﬁnite solids for
which DFT can only treat neutral systems.

Lucky enough, in DFT there exists an “IP theorem”2,3
which states that the negative eigenvalue of the highest
occupied Kohn-Sham orbital, -εN , happens to be equal
to the IP. However, the IP theorem relies on the exact
exchange-correlation potential vxc which is unknown and
must be approximated. Popular approximations such
as the local density approximation (LDA) or general-
ized gradient approximations (GGA) suﬀer from the self-
interaction (SI) error4 which pushes up occupied states
and causes LDA/GGA to systematically underestimate
the IP. For atoms and molecules5, the IP error (Hereafter
“IP error” speciﬁcally refers to the deviation of the −εN
of LDA/GGA from the true IP) can be as large as 5 ∼ 10
eV, while for semiconductors6,7 it is typically 1 eV. Con-
sequently, the powerful DFT-Kohn-Sham scheme has not
been able to get reliable IP’s for semiconductors even as
simple as silicon.

In this paper we make a major step forward, showing
that by use of the optimized eﬀective potential8–10 within
the authentic slab geometry12 the IP theorem can predict
semiconductor IP11 as accurate as the much more sophis-

ticated GWA. Since the whole procedure is restricted to
the DFT-Kohn-Sham realm, the computational cost is as
low as LDA/GGA. For the ﬁrst time, this opens the way
for systematic calculation of semiconductor IP’s by the
DFT-Kohn-Sham scheme.

The condition for accurate IP is much more stringent
than for accurate total energy, since vxc depends on every
detail of the exchange-correlation hole while total energy
only requires the spherical average of the hole to be cor-
rect. This explains why LDA/GGA behave drastically
diﬀerent for the two quantities. For ﬁnite systems, it
has long been established5 that the exact vxc must de-
cay as slowly as −1/r away from the physical system.
However, due to the SI error LDA/GGA decay exponen-
tially fast. Consequently, a large negative portion of vxc
is missing which is responsible for most of the eigenvalue
overestimation. Often, the accuracy of IP can be im-
proved by correcting the wrong asymptotic behavior of
the vxc. However, for solid surfaces asymptotically long-
ranged potentials are very hard to use with the supercell
method12, so that the role of the long range part of vxc
has remained unexplored. As revealed by this work, the
eﬀects are not as strong as for ﬁnite systems, but still too
signiﬁcant to be simply ignored.

The exact-exchange only optimized eﬀective potential
(EXX-OEP, or simply OEP as in this work) is the lo-
cal multiplicative potential minimizing the Hartree-Fock
expression of total energy. Using OEP to calculate semi-
conductor IP is inspired by the fact that most SI resides
in the exchange part of vxc, while OEP is self-interaction
free13, and satisﬁes many exact conditions especially the
desired −1/r asymptotic behavior14. For neutral and
ionized atoms15 as well as small molecules6, OEP re-
moves the IP errors by more than 80%.

is not trivially seen because its success for atoms and
molecules seems to rely on the overwhelmingly domi-
nant role of exchange, while in solids correlation is much
stronger. In fact, so far there is only one work16 using
OEP to calculate semiconductor IP’s. For graphene the
obtained value is 8.13 eV which severely overestimates
the experimental IP of 4.6 eV. Consequently, the author
concluded that the correlation potential for graphene has
to be repulsive. For Si (111) the obtained value is 5.45
eV which still overestimates the experiment by 0.4 eV.
In fact, The Si result is unreliable since the slab is too
thin (It contains only three bilayers) and the surface is
not relaxed. In general, OEP is not considered useful for
semiconductor IP, a conclusion we will challenge in this
paper.

The application of OEP for solids has not become pop-
ular mainly because the construction of the exact OEP
is technically very challenging: OEP is computationally
costly, and is extremely sensitive to subtle balance of the
basis sets17–19. For semiconductor IP the problem is ag-
onized due to its extra surface dependence which there-
fore requires the OEP of the complex surface structure.
Moreover, OEP decays as slowly as −1/z from surface.
Like other long-ranged potentials, it is very hard to use
with the supercell method12,16.

This work is made possible by implementing an ap-
proximate OEP, the Becke-Johnson’06 (BJ06) exchange
potential20, to the authentic slab geometry (ASG) which
is a surface technique suitable for both short- and long-
ranged potentials12. Even for simple systems, using ap-
proximate OEP to avoid the intricacy of the exact OEP
is common. For example, the Krieger-Li-Iafrate (KLI)
approximation21 has been much more popular than the
exact OEP itself. Compared to KLI, BJ06 is less ac-
curate. But for the following reasons BJ06 shall well
represent the performance of OEP: (i) For atoms BJ06
approaches the exact OEP very closely. (ii) For solids
it satisﬁes the uniform electron gas limit. (iii) For ﬁnite
systems BJ06 decays as −1/r + C (C is positive and sys-
tem dependent), and it is found22 to reduce the IP errors
by as much as 60%. (iv) For solid surface BJ06 decays
as12 −1/z + C which will be shown to be equivalent to
the asymptotic behavior of the exact OEP. To account
for the stronger correlation in solids, in this work BJ06 is
amended by LDA correlation23. The total vxc is termed
BJ06c throughout this paper.

The IP calculation follows the usual two-step proce-

dure: First by a bulk calculation (with the primitive cell)
to get εvbm, the eigenvalue of the valence band maximum
(VBM); Then by a surface calculation using a slab like
FIG.1 for the alignment of the Coulomb potential. The
surface calculation is needed since in the bulk calculation
the Coulomb potential is determined only up to a global
constant due to the use of periodic boundary conditions.
The expression of IP used in this work is:
Coul − vs.cell
Coul ,

IP = −εp.cell

vbm + vp.cell

(1)

in which vp.cell
is the average Coulomb potential of the
Coul
bulk, and vs.cell
Coul the drop of the average Coulomb poten-
tial from the vacuum edge to the center of the slab. Since
vs.cell
Coul is caused by the formation of surface dipoles, it is
very sensitive to the surface charge distribution which is
the ﬁrst hint that the long-range part of the vxc shall
play an important role in the ﬁnal IP.

Using BJ06c within ASG, we have calculated the IP’s
of 17 semiconductors. The results are presented in Table
I and FIG.2 and are compared to GWA7,25 and experi-
ment. Through the two-step procedure, the accuracy of
IP is determined by the surface part of the calculation
which may be checked by comparing Eq.(1) with −εslab
vbm,
the negative eigenvalue of the VBM of the slab. This is
because, providing surface states are absent, then Eq.(1)
and −εslab
vbm shall give the same IP value unless the slab
is not suﬃciently thick. Indeed, for 14 semiconductors
Eq.(1) and −εslab
vbm diﬀer by less than 0.1 eV. The ex-
ceptions are BN, SiC, CdS for which surface states are
present. Therefore, the numerical accuracy of our IP’s is
better than 0.1 eV.

Couls.cellvCouledgevzConsistent with earlier works, GGA27 consistently un-
derestimates the experimental IP’s by about 1 eV. With
BJ06c, all IP’s are upshifted, and the corrections upon
GGA are from 0.70 eV (for Si) to 1.11 eV (for CdTe). Ex-
perimentally, the IP measurement is extremely sensitive
to the samples’ surface condition which has led to large
scattering of the IP data. Consequently, strict quantita-
tive comparison between theories and experiment is im-
possible. Nevertheless, the extent of the corrections by
BJ06c is in the desired range and is similar to GWA. The
largest discrepancy is found for ZnO28 which is also a dif-
ﬁcult case for GWA. In general, the performance of BJ06c
is quite impressive since it is a local potential, request-
ing essentially negligible computational cost compared to
GWA.

bulk calculation there is no asymptotic region. Note that
the electron self-energy also shares similar asymptotic
behavior29, the existing GWA studies7,25,26 can therefore
be used as convenient examples to assist our analysis.
For this purpose, let us recall that all GWA calculations
are only applied to the bulk, while the slabs are always
treated by GGA so that:

IPGWA = IPGGA − ∆εp.cell

vbm + ∆vp.cell
Coul .

(2)

In this way, ∆vs.cell
Coul , together with all eﬀects of the long-
range part of vxc, are completely ignored. In fact, if the
GWA of the bulk is performed in the one-shot fashion,
i.e. without self-consistency, then ∆vp.cell
Coul is also ignored.
Since Coulomb potential is uniquely determined by den-
sity, the underlying assumption is that the GGA densities
are already accurate enough to be directly used for the
IP calculations.

FIG. 2. (Color on line) IP’s of the 17 semiconductors from
GGA (black solid line) and BJ06c (red solid line) calculated
by Eq.(1). The experimental data (black dots) and the GW
results (blue and green dotted lines) are the same as Table I.

From Table I and FIG.2 the performance of BJ06c is
about equally good for solids as for atoms15 and small
molecules6. This contradicts the earlier report16 that
OEP is not useful for semiconductor IP. In fact, we have
also calculated the IP of graphene by BJ06c and obtained
4.6 eV which is in excellent agreement with experiment.
Therefore, a repulsive correlation potential is not needed.
We note in Ref.16 the OEP was generated by supercell.
Limited by the low eﬃciency of the supercell method, the
sheet separation is only 14 Bohr which is deﬁnitely not
suﬃcient to achieve the asymptotic value of the OEP at
the vacuum edge.

The long-range part of vxc has been well understood
for ﬁnite systems, but is widely ignored in surface calcula-
tions for which the erroneously short-ranged LDA/GGA
are almost exclusively used. To check its eﬀects for solid
surface, we have decomposed ∆IP, the total IP correc-
tion upon GGA, into the three individual contributions
of ∆εp.cell
Coul following Eq.(1). With
this decomposition the eﬀects of the long-range part of
the vxc are only reﬂected in the surface term since in the

Coul , and ∆vs.cell

vbm , ∆vp.cell

From Table II, the average contribution of the three
terms to the total ∆IP are 82%, 23% and -5%, respec-
tively. Therefore, the bulk part of the corrections indeed
accounts for most of the ∆IP which lends fundamental
support to the GWA treatment. Especially, the small-
ness of ∆vp.cell
implies that the GGA bulk density is in-
Coul
deed of high quality. Problem, however, exists in ∆vs.cell
Coul
since its 23% contribution to the total ∆IP is certainly
non-negligible. Especially, for the two Te compounds the
contributions are larger than 40%. This means that the
GGA slab density is not suﬃciently accurate.

The reason why the two GGA densities are of diﬀerent
quality is because SI behaves diﬀerently in the bulk and
the slab: Within the bulk, SI usually causes the density
to over-delocalize. However, this problem mostly aﬀects
strongly correlated materials, while for weak to interme-
diate correlation it is not very serious. In fact, within the

of Coulomb potential as having been illustrated by Li et
al.14. On the other hand, in the slab case Coulomb po-
tential cannot compensate the missing tail of GGA since
it decays even faster than the vxc. Consequently, the SI
error is more prevailing in the slab than in the bulk.

To make sure that ∆vs.cell

Coul is indeed related to the long-
range part of BJ06c, we have plotted the two vxc’s for
FIG.1 together with the diﬀerence of their macroscopi-
cally averaged24 density. FIG.3 shows that within the
bulk BJ06c is deeper than GGA which explains the down-
shift of εvbm. The most obvious distinction, however, is
around the slab surface: While GGA already decays to
zero at about z = 40, BJ06c climbs up very slowly to its
0.20 value at the vacuum edge of z = 247 (not shown).
Correspondingly, within the bulk the electron density is
essentially unchanged. Only near the surface does the
slow variation of BJ06c strongly perturb the surface den-
sity. For the relaxed slab, this enhances the surface dipole
and changes vs.cell
Coul by -0.22 eV which contributes posi-
tively to the total ∆IP of 0.93 eV.

FIG. 3.

is between atomic sites to avoid the divergence of the GGA at
the nuclei. Inset shows the diﬀerence of the macroscopically
averaged24 slab density ∆¯ρ(z) = ¯ρBJ06c(z) − ¯ρGGA(z). Black
dots indicate the location of the atomic planes.

Compared to atoms and molecules, the eﬀects of the
long-range part of the vxc are weaker for solid surface.
This is because the wave functions are mainly bound to
the slab while less exposed to the vacuum or the asymp-
totic region. At this point, it is necessary to point out
that the exact asymptotic behavior of vxc for solid surface
is still unresolved12,16. In BJ06c, the asymptotic behav-

4
ior −1/z + C of the exchange part is exact according to
the form found in Ref.3, since the C constant has no eﬀect
on the slab density or ∆vs.cell
Coul . On the other hand, the
LDA correlation is still erroneously short-ranged. Conse-
quently, the ∆vs.cell
Coul data in Table II contain systematic
errors which are hard to evaluate. Nevertheless, ∆vs.cell
Coul
is at least system dependent, and there is no apparent
reason why it can be universally neglected. For an ex-
ample, it is found that GGA can successfully lineup the
Coulomb potential at the interface of hetero-structures.
This is frequently cited to support the similar use of
GGA for the potential alignment in the IP calculation
by GWA7,25,26. However, the two interfaces are funda-
mentally diﬀerent: The asymptotic behavior of vxc is op-
erative only at the slab-vacuum interface, but has little
eﬀect at the interface of hetero-structure because, again,
there is no asymptotic region.

Indirect evidence supporting non-negligible ∆vs.cell
Coul
may be found in existing GWA results. As Table II
shows, except for ZnO, all ∆vs.cell
Coul contribute positively
to ∆IP. Therefore, by neglecting this term GWA shall
systematically underestimate the semiconductor IP’s. In-
deed, it has been consistently found7,25,26 that semicon-
ductor IP’s calculated by GWA starting from GGA are
systematically too low. Nevertheless, since the same
GWA procedure also underestimates the band gaps, it
is envisioned that both problems are due to the same
origin of insuﬃcient quasiparticle corrections.

If ∆vs.cell
Coul

is indeed universally negligible, then by
merely improving GWA it shall be possible to achieve
accurate band gaps and accurate IP’s at the same
time. To enhance quasiparticle corrections, hybrid func-
tionals have been used to replace the GGA starting
point25,26. As they seem to over-correct the problems,
the fraction of the Fock exchange is changed to an ad-
justable parameter26. Alternatively, vertex function from
certain cross diagrams is included to scale down the
corrections25. Besides, quasiparticle self-consistency30
with the screened interaction of GGA26 is also attempted.
It is found, however, when the IP’s seem to agree to ex-
periment, the band gaps are unevenly overestimated25.
On the other hand, when the band gaps seem to agree
to experiment, half of the IP’s are overestimated26. Al-
though in both cases it is claimed that further vertex
corrections shall reconcile the conﬂicts, it is not clear
how the extra corrections only aﬀect either the IP’s or
the band gaps, while leaving the other set unchanged.

11 Strictly speaking, for inﬁnite solids the IP theorem does
not hold anymore. This is because the existence of this
theorem for ﬁnite systems is based on the fact that the
highest occupied orbital is also the most extended orbital in
space. For solid surface, however, the most extended orbital
is usually the highest occupied orbital at the Γ-point of
the planar Brillouin zone which may not be the VBM (See
Ref.16 for details). Nevertheless, possible deviation from
the IP theorem is likely small and is not considered in this
work.

13 Strictly speaking, OEP is SI free only at one-electron level.
Higher order SI may exist at N -electron level, and its ef-
fects to the IP’s remain to be seen. For more information
about the N -electron SI, see P. Mori-S´anchez, A.J. Cohen
and W. Yang, J. Chem. Phys. 125, 201102 (2006).

23 The choice of LDA over GGA is purely technical. Since SI
typically behaves similarly in LDA and GGA, we expect
similar performance for the IP’s if BJ06c is amended by a
GGA correlation.

28 Albeit being an insulator, ZnO is well known for its persis-
tent and mysterious n-type conductivity. It is possible that
the IP measurement suﬀers from strong surface charging
eﬀect.
