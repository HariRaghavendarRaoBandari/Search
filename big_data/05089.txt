An existence result for the steady rotating Prandtl

equation

Anne-Laure Dalibard & Matthew Paddick∗†

March 2016

Abstract

We consider a steady, geophysical 2D ﬂuid in a domain, and focus on its western
boundary layer, which is formally governed by a variant of the Prandtl equation.
By using the von Mises change of variables, we show that this equation is well-
posed under the assumption that the trace of the interior stream function has large
variations, and that the variations in the coastline proﬁle are moderate.

Key words: steady Prandtl equation, geophysical ﬂuids, boundary layer theory

Introduction

The goal of this article is to prove the global existence of solutions of the stationary
Prandtl-like equation

in the domain Ω = {(ξ, y) ∈ R2 | y > 0, ξ > 0}. The function ψ0 is given and smooth,
λ0 is a strictly positive parameter, and the function ν is a smooth function with ν ≥ 1.
This equation arises in geophysical models to describe the behaviour of western bound-
ary oceanic currents in certain regimes. We describe the physical assumptions and scaling
leading to (1) in paragraph 1.3 after the statement of our main result, but let us merely
mention that the role of the function ν is to take into account the geometry of the western
coast.

where the functions vE and pE are given (they are the trace of some outer Euler ﬂow)
and satisfy vEv′E = − dpE
dy . Notice that here we have ν(y) = 1, which corresponds to a ﬂat
boundary. The main diﬀerences between the usual Prandtl equation (2) and equation
(1) lie in the presence of the additional term ψ in the equation (which is due to rotation,
as we will explain in paragraph 1.3) and in the condition at inﬁnity, which bears on the
stream function ψ rather than on the velocity v. These two diﬀerences will result in
signiﬁcant changes in the analysis of equation (1).

The mathematical analysis of the stationary Prandtl equation (2) goes back to the
seminal work of Ole˘inik [9, 10], who proved that if v0 is smooth such that v0 ≥ 0, v′0(0) > 0
and v0(ξ) > 0 for ξ > 0, then solutions of (2) exist, at least locally in y and globally if
dpE
dy ≤ 0. Her idea was to consider (2) as a non-local and non-linear evolution equation,
with the variable y playing the role of time. With this point of view, as long as v remains
non-negative, the equation has a parabolic structure, and is therefore locally well-posed.
The method of proof relies on the use of a nonlinear change of variables due to von Mises,
which transforms (2) into a local non-linear diﬀusion equation.

The aim of this paper is to adapt these ideas to equation (1), and to exhibit math-
ematical conditions on λ0, ν, ψ0 that would ensure the existence and uniqueness of a
solution such that v remains positive. In the course of the proof, we will focus on the
diﬀerences between equations (1) and (2). We will also discuss the physical meaning of
our conditions.

1.1 Short review of previous works on equation (1)

Some elements of analysis are given in the book by Pedlosky [11], following the analysis of
Ierley and Ruehr [7]. In these works, it is assumed that ν(y) ≡ 1 and that ψ0(y) = αy + 1
for some α > 0 and that χ ≡ 0 in order to simplify matters. In this case, it is natural
to seek a solution in which the variables are separated, that is ψ(ξ, y) = φ(ξ)ψ0(y) (see
[11]). Plugging this into (1), we get the ODE on φ

φ′′′ = λ0α((φ′)2 − φφ′′) + φ − 1.

(3)

The equation has an equilibrium at φ ≡ 1, and we now examine the linearised equation
around this equilibrium, which reads

ϕ(3) = −λ0αϕ′′ + ϕ.

(4)

1Note that here y is the tangential variable and ξ is the rescaled normal variable, in contrast with the
usual convention in the study of the Prandtl equation. We have made this choice to stick to the geophys-
ical setting, in which u is the East-West component of the velocity and v its North-South component.

2

The solutions of this equation are of the form ϕ = C exp(−aξ), with a satisfying

pα(a) := λ0αa2 − a3 − 1 = 0.

(5)

A quick study of the function a ∈ R 7→ pα(a) shows that pα always has exactly one
negative root, and two strictly positive roots if and only if

λ0α > 3r27

4

.

(6)

If λ0α < 3q 27
4 , then pα has two complex conjugate roots with positive real part and
non-zero imaginary part. In the case where ψ0 is aﬃne, we therefore expect solutions of
(3) to behave as ξ → ∞ as linear combinations of exp(−a±ξ), where a± are the two roots
of pα with positive real part (putting aside the degenerate case λ0α = 3q 27

At this stage, let us recall that we look for solutions such that v > 0, or in other words,
such that ψ is strictly increasing with respect to ξ. This choice is made necessary by the
Prandtl-like (or diﬀusion-like) structure of equation (1): indeed, the theoretical construc-
tion of solutions of (2) when v takes negative values is widely open, even though numerical
schemes relying on the theory of “interactive boundary layers” or “triple deck solutions”
exist (see, for example, P-Y. Lagr´ee [8]). Therefore we want to consider solutions of (3)
such that φ is increasing in ξ. The linearised equation suggests that a necessary condition
is (6): indeed, if λ0 is small, then we expect the solutions in a neighbourhood of φ = 1
to behave like

4 ).

1 − C cos(ℑ(a+)ξ) exp(−ℜ(a+)ξ),

and therefore to be non-monotonous.

This heuristic analysis is conﬁrmed by the study of the case where λ0 = 0 (linear)
on one hand, and by the numerical simulations and analytic computations of Ierley and
Ruehr [7] on the other. Indeed, in the linear case, the solution of (3) endowed with the
conditions φ(0) = φ′(0) = 0 is exactly

φ(ξ) = 1 +

cos √3

6! exp(cid:18)−

Hence it is easily checked that φ changes sign. In the case when λ0 is small but non zero,
the numerical simulations and analytic computations of [7], conﬁrmed by the later study
of Smith and Mallier [12], suggest that there exists a critical value of λ under which v
may change sign, and above which v remains positive. The purpose of this article is to
give some theoretical foundation to these observations: we will indeed prove that if λ0 is
large enough, under suitable assumptions on ψ0, then solutions of (1) exist with v > 0.

1.2 Main result

Throughout the article, the polynomial

Py(t) = ν(y)2t3 − ν(y)λ0(ψ0)′(y)t2 + 1,

t ∈ R

3

will play a fundamental role. Studying its variations closely, it can be checked that if
4 , Py has exactly two positive roots. We denote a(y) the smallest

λ0(ψ0)′(y)/ν(y)1/3 > 3q 27

of these roots, so that Py is decreasing in the vicinity of a(y).

The existence result is the following.

Theorem 1.1. Let ψ0 ∈ C2([0, Y ]) such that inf ψ0 > 0,
λ0(ψ0)′(y)/ν(y)1/3 > 2 + η > 3q 27
W 2,∞(R+), positive on ]0, +∞[, with v(0) = 0, v′0(0) > 0, such thatR +∞

inf ψ′0 > 0. Assume that
for every y ≥ 0 and for some η > 0. Let v0 ∈
v0(ξ) dξ = ψ0(0).

We assume that v0 satisﬁes the corner compatibility condition

with v > 0 in ΩY . Furthermore, v satisﬁes the following properties.

• Behaviour close to ξ = 0: for some ξ0, m > 0, depending on Y , we have ∂ξv > m

for ξ ≤ ξ0.

• Behaviour close to ξ = ∞: for every y, v(ξ, y) ∼ a(y)(ψ0(y) − ψ(ξ, y)) as ξ → ∞.

Remark.

• The condition on the lower bound of λ0(ψ0)′ν−1/3 is more stringent than
the one suggested by the analysis of the linearised equation (4). We will see that
this condition stems from the necessity of having a good control on the derivatives
of v (see Proposition 3.9).

• Conditions (7) and (8) are compatibility conditions on the initial data close to ξ = 0
and ξ = ∞. Our result shows that these properties are propagated by the equation.
Notice also that the decay condition at inﬁnity is the one that is expected from the
analysis of the linearised equation (4), and it implies rapid (exponential) decrease
in the variable ξ. This last fact is explained in the proof of Corollary 2.2.

• Notice that our theorem requires both ψ0 and (ψ0)′ to be strictly positive. This is
consistent with the analysis of [11] in which ψ0 is linear with a positive slope. Once
again, we believe that such an assumption is necessary to obtain the positivity of
v. Indeed, the important quantity is really λ0(ψ0)′, so that having a negative (ψ0)′

4

and a positive λ0 is more or less equivalent to having a positive (ψ0)′ and a negative
λ0, and the work of Ierley and Ruehr [7] gives numerical and analytic evidence that
when λ0 is negative and ψ0 is linear, with ν ≡ 1, the function v takes negative
values.
We will make further remarks on the physical meaning of our conditions in the next

paragraph.

Looking for a positive solution to the problem implies, by deﬁnition of the stream
function, that ψ is monotonous, increasing in the variable ξ. Thus, the von Mises trans-
form, used originally on the ordinary steady Prandtl equation (2) by O. Ole˘inik [9], ﬁts
the setting we have introduced. The change turns the unknown function ψ into an inde-
pendent variable, and the Prandtl equation becomes a PDE for w(ψ, y) = v2(ψ(ξ, y), y)
on the ﬁnite domain

D = {(ψ, y) ∈ R2 | 0 < y < Y and 0 < ψ < ψ0(y)}.

The parabolic equation we obtain is degenerate, in the sense that the square root of
the unknown w appears as a factor in the diﬀusive term, and this function is assumed
to vanish on the left- and right-hand boundaries of D. An approximate problem is
considered, and we construct explicit super- and sub-solutions in order to get uniform
Lipschitz bounds, allowing us to get a solution of the degenerate problem by taking the
limit of these approximate solutions.

The proof given in sections 2-4 follows the plan of O. Ole˘inik and V. Samokhin [10],

and what happens near the left-hand boundary of D, the set

is identical. The new diﬃculty for our case is the presence of a right-hand boundary,

{(ψ, y) | 0 ≤ y ≤ Y and ψ = 0},

{(ψ, y) | 0 ≤ y ≤ Y and ψ = ψ0(y)},

and having to control what happens there.
Indeed, we need v to be exponentially de-
creasing in ξ, and ψ itself should converge exponentially towards ψ0; we therefore expect
w(ψ, y) to be O((ψ0 − ψ)2). The link between these behaviours is shown below.

1.3 Physical derivation of equation (1)

The starting point is the 3D homogeneous, incompressible Navier-Stokes-Coriolis equa-
tions with anisotropic viscosity, which describe the motion of oceanic currents at mid-
latitudes on large horizontal scales (100 − 1000 km).
In an appropriate scaling (fast
rotation, thin layer domain, small vertical viscosity), it can be proved that the ﬂuid be-
haves in the limit like a 2D ﬂuid; we refer for instance to the study by Desjardins and
Grenier [5]. The equation describing the motion then becomes

(10)

where

5

• ζ = curl (¯u1, ¯u2) is the vorticity;
• Ω is a two-dimensional domain representing the oceanic basin;
• β > 0 is a parameter characterising the beta-plane approximation (linearisation of

the Coriolis factor around a given latitude);

• − r0

2 ζ is the Ekman pumping term due to friction on the bottom, and βcurl τ is the
Ekman pumping term due to the wind stress at the surface (τ is a given function);

• ηB describes the variations of topography of the bottom;
• Re is the Reynolds number.

Equation (10) is endowed with no-slip boundary conditions:

¯u|∂Ω = 0.
Let us assume that the domain Ω is of the form

Ω = {(x, y) ∈ R2, χ(y) < x < σ(y), 0 < y < Y },

where the functions χ and σ are given and smooth. We now look at the asymptotic
behavior of equation (10) in the limit

λ ≪ 1,

r0 ≪ 1, Re ≫ 1.

In order to simplify the analysis, we assume that the bottom is ﬂat, so that ηB = 0.
We look for stationary approximate solutions of (10). In the limit λ, r0, (Re)−1 → 0, we
expect the solution in the interior to satisfy the Sverdrup relation,

βuint

2 = βcurl τ,

i.e. ∂xψint = curl τ,

where the stream function ψint is deﬁned by uint = ∇⊥ψint. However, such a function
cannot satisfy all the boundary conditions: it is well-known that a dissymmetry occurs
between western and eastern boundaries (see [11, 5] and the further analysis in [4]) and
that ψint should vanish on the eastern boundary, so

ψint(x, y) = −Z σ(y)

x

curl τ.

However, in general ψint does not vanish on the western boundary. Therefore a boundary
layer is created close to the western coastline, in order to satisfy the no-slip boundary
conditions ψ|∂Ω = 0, ∂nψ|∂Ω = 0. The nature of this boundary layer depends on the
sizes of the parameters λ, Re, r0. Notice that in the stationary case, equation (10) can be
re-written as

(11)

An extensive discussion around the sizes of the parameters and the corresponding gov-
erning equations for the western boundary layer can be found in [11]. So far, linear Munk
layers, which formally correspond to the case r0 ≪ (Re)−1/3 ≪ 1, λ ≪ (Re)−2/3 ≪ 1

6

have been thoroughly studied (see for instance [2, 4]; we also refer to [3] for the study of
a non-linear version of this problem when λ ∼ (Re)−1 in the presence of a rough bound-
ary; in this setting, the boundary layer equation remains elliptic, which will not be the
case in our study). Stommel layers, which correspond to the case (Re)−1 ≪ r3
0 ≪ 1,
λ ≪ r2
0 ≪ 1, have been studied in [5]; we also refer to [1], in which Barcilon, Constantin
and Titi prove the existence of weak solutions and of stationary solutions of (10) (in the
vorticity formulation) in the regime Re = +∞, r0 ≪ 1.
Here, we want to study the inﬂuence of the nonlinear term in the case of a smooth
western boundary. The correct scaling to retain the nonlinear term is therefore λ ∝
(Re)−2/3. We therefore take r0 = 0, β = 1 and λ = λ0(Re)−2/3 for some parameter
λ0 > 0 which we will keep throughout our study. A formal analysis shows that the
boundary layer size is expected to be (Re)−1/3. Hence we plug an ansatz of the form
ψ = ψBL((x − χ(y))(Re)1/3, y) into (11), so that, when Re → +∞,

∆ψ ∼ (Re)2/3(1 + χ′(y)2)∂2
∆2ψ ∼ (Re)4/3(1 + χ′(y)2)2∂4

ξ ψBL((x − χ(y))(Re)1/3, y),
ξ ψBL((x − χ(y))(Re)1/3, y).

We ﬁnd that the equation satisﬁed by ψBL = ψBL(ξ, y) is

ξ ψBL − ∂yψBL∂3

with no-slip boundary conditions ψBL

end of the boundary layer, ψBL → ψ0(y) := −R σ(y)

∂ξψBLψ∂y∂2

ξ ψBL − ∂yψBL∂3
we infer that the equation becomes

ξ ψBL(cid:3) + ∂ξψBL − (1 + χ′(y)2)2∂4
|ξ=0 = 0. In the limit ξ → ∞, i.e. at the
χ(y) curl τ (x, y) dx. Noticing that

ξ ψBL = 0,

ξ ψBL = ∂ξ(cid:2)∂ξψBL∂y∂ξψBL − ∂yψBL∂2
ξ ψBL(cid:3) + ψBL − (1 + χ′(y)2)2∂3

ξ ψBL(cid:3) ,

λ0(1 + χ′(y)2)(cid:2)∂ξψBL∂y∂ξψBL − ∂yψBL∂2
ξ ψBL = ψ0(y).
Now, setting (u, v) = (−∂yψBL, ∂ξψBL) (the scaled velocity in the boundary layer), we
obtain
(12)

λ0(1 + χ′(y)2) [u∂ξv + v∂yv] + ψBL − (1 + χ′(y)2)2∂2

ξ v = ψ0(y),

with the boundary conditions

|ξ=0 = 0,

ψBL(ξ, y) = ψ0(y),

lim
ξ→∞

lim
ξ→∞

v(ξ, y) = 0.

Dropping the BL superscript in ψBL, we obtain equation (1) with ν(y) := (1 + χ′(y)2).
The function ν therefore describes the geometry of the coastline.

Remark (Physical meaning of the conditions in Theorem 1.1).

• The condition λ0(ψ0)′(y)/ν(y)1/3 > 2 + η fails as χ′ becomes inﬁnite, for example
when y reaches the South and North extremities of the ocean basin. But it is well
known that even the derivation of classical linear Munk layers fails in this case, and

7

that the nature and the size of the boundary layer changes in the vicinity of these
points (see [4]). Our result also shows that a boundary layer separation
could be caused by a sudden change in the coastline, since the quantity
λ0(ψ0)′ν−1/3 would dip below the critical threshold which ensures that there is no
recirculation.

• From a physical point of view, the sign of ψ0 is related to the direction of the rotation
of winds and currents in the underlying gyre, since ψ0 is the integral of curl τ . The
positivity of (ψ0)′ means that the rotation of winds is stronger at higher latitudes.
The size of λ0 is related to the intensity of the non-linear eﬀects compared to the
rotation. Therefore our result could be summarized as: “in a rotating gyre, if the
intensity of inertial forces is strong enough and the coastline has slow variations,
there is no recirculation, and no separation phenomenon in the western boundary
layer”.

• We have formulated our result on a bounded interval (0, Y ), keeping in mind the
physical picture of an ocean basin between two ﬁxed latitudes, but from a mathemat-
ical point of view, we could have assumed that Y = +∞, thereby constructing global
solutions. Notice also that because of the condition on ν, the y-interval is actually
smaller than that of the actual ocean basin: we must exclude the zone close to the
North and South extremities.

2 Reformulation of the equation and statements in

von Mises variables

Fix Y > 0 for the rest of the paper. Starting with equation (9), we follow [10] and make
the von Mises change of variables,

(ξ, y) 7→ (ψ(ξ, y), y),

(13)

and choose a new unknown function, w = w(ψ, y) such that w(ψ, y) = v2(ψ(ξ, y), y). The
chain rule allows us to express the derivatives: we have

Therefore the equation on w is the degenerate parabolic PDE

on the domain D, which, we recall, is

The corner compatibility condition for the initial datum w0 is deduced from (7),

ν(0)2pw0(ψ)w′′0(ψ) + 2(ψ0(0) − ψ) = O(ψ)

Concerning the behaviour of w as ψ → ψ0(y), we have

for ψ ≪ 1.

w0(ψ) ∼ a(0)2(ψ0(0) − ψ)2

as ψ → ψ0(0).

(16)

(17)

The goal of the next sections is to prove the two following results: the ﬁrst one
deals with existence and uniqueness of solutions of (15), together with some qualitative
properties.

Proposition 2.1. Let ψ0 ∈ C2([0, Y ]) be a positive increasing function. Assume that
λ0(ψ0)′(y)ν(y)−1/3 > 2 + η > 3q 27
for every y ≥ 0 and for some η > 0. Let w0 :
[0, ψ0(0)] → R+ be a C2 function satisfying (16) and (17).
positive in the interior of D. Furthermore, w satisﬁes the following properties.

Then there exists a unique classical solution w of equation (15) such that w is strictly

• Behaviour near ψ = 0: ∂ψw(y, 0) > 0 for all y ∈ [0, Y ] and there exists β ∈ (0, 1/2),

C > 0 such that

in a neighbourhood of ψ = 0.

|∂yw(ψ, y)| ≤ Cψ1−β

• Boundedness of the derivatives: ∂ψw and ∂yw are bounded in ¯D.
• Behaviour near ψ = ψ0(y): as ψ → ψ0(y),

w(ψ, y) ∼ a(y)2(cid:0)ψ0(y) − ψ(cid:1)2

,

and there exist C1 functions E±(y) > 0 and a constant C0 > 0 such that
−E−(y)(ψ0(y) − ψ) ≤ ∂ψw(ψ, y) ≤ −E+(y)(ψ0(y) − ψ)

and

|∂yw(ψ, y)| ≤ C0(ψ0(y) − ψ)

in a neighbourhood of the boundary {ψ = ψ0(y)}.

The second result ensures the existence of a solution to the rotating Prandtl equation

(9).

Corollary 2.2. Assume that there exists a solution of (15) with the properties listed in
Proposition 2.1. Deﬁne v = v(ξ, y) through the inverse change of variables to (13), and u
as the y-derivative of the stream function ψ. Then (u, v, ψ) solve (9) with the properties
mentioned in Theorem 1.1.

We will show the uniqueness part of Theorem 1.1 in section 4, after proving uniqueness

for equation (15).

Proof of Corollary 2.2. The reverse change of variables is

(ξ, y) = Z ψ(ξ,y)

ds, y! .

(18)

We ﬁrst notice that, given the behaviour of w near s = 0 and s = +∞, the above integral
is convergent for ξ < +∞, and that the limit ψ → ψ0(y) indeed corresponds to ξ → +∞.
Diﬀerentiating (18) with respect to ψ, we notice that ∂ψξ = 1/pw(ψ, y), which implies

that ∂ξψ = v. The boundary and compatibility conditions are obviously satisﬁed, but let
us explain why the decay condition (8) implies that v(ξ, y) is exponentially decreasing
in ξ. For a ﬁxed y and a small δ > 0, there exist 0 < c < a(y) < C such that for
ψ0(y) − δ < s < ψ0(y),

Integrating from ψ0(y) − δ to ψ(ξ, y), we get that ξ is logarithmic in ψ, and we obtain

c(ψ0(y) − s) ≤pw(s, y) ≤ C(ψ0(y) − s).
Kδe−Cξ ≤ ψ0(y) − ψ(ξ, y) ≤ Kδe−cξ.

Inserting this in the equivalent for v as ψ → ψ0(y), we see the rapid decrease property.
Diﬀerentiating the expression of ξ in (18) with respect to y, we obtain a formula for

−∂yψ = u:

u(ξ, y) = −∂yψ = −

∂yw(s, y)
w3/2(s, y)

ds.

(19)

With this, we can determine the limits as ξ → 0 and +∞ of u. Indeed, on one hand, we
have the fact that for 0 < s ≪ 1,

w−3/2(s, ψ)∂yw(s, ψ) = O(s−3/2ψ1−β) = O(s−1/2−β),

and 1/2 + β < 1.

On the other hand, by Proposition 2.1, as ξ → +∞, we have ∂yw(s, y) = O((ψ0(y) −

s)) and w = O((ψ0(y) − s)2), so

∂yw(s, y)
w3/2(s, y)

= O((ψ0(y) − s)−1/2)

as s → ψ0(y).

In both cases, the integral in (19) is shown to be convergent for any ψ, and is therefore
bounded. The factor √w then shows that u satisﬁes the zero boundary condition at
ξ = 0 and the limit condition at ξ → +∞. With the identities in (14), we then see that
(u, v, ψ) solve the Prandtl equation in a classical way.

The next sections are devoted to the proof of Proposition 2.1. We ﬁrst recall some
notation and useful results. In the rest of the article, we will call “left-hand boundary”
the boundary {ψ = 0}, and “right-hand boundary” the boundary {ψ = ψ0(y)}. We will
strongly rely on the fact that the functional map in equation (15),

L : f 7→ λ0ν(y)∂yf − ν(y)2pf ∂2

ψf,

has maximum and comparison principles that we state below, providing f does not vanish.
We send the reader to Ole˘inik & Samokhin for the proof (it uses a standard contradiction
method on the assumption of an interior extremum).
Lemma 2.3 ([10], Lemmata 2.1.2 and 2.1.3). Let D be an open subset of R2 of the form

D = {(ψ, y) | 0 < y < Y and L(y) < ψ < R(y)},

and Γ be the parabolic boundary of D,

Γ = {(ψ, y) ∈ D | ψ = L(y) or y = 0 or ψ = R(y)}.

Consider a diﬀerential operator of the form

A(w) = ∂yw + b(y, w)∂ψw + c(ψ, y)w − d(y, w)∂2

ψw,

in which d(y, w), b(y, w), c(ψ, y) are bounded for (ψ, y) ∈ D, and w bounded, d and b
have bounded partial derivatives with respect to w, and d takes strictly positive values.
Let f and g be continuous functions in D such that their derivatives occurring in A are
continuous in D \ Γ.

Assume that

A(f ) ≥ A(g) in D and f ≥ g on Γ.

Then f ≥ g in D.

Remark. Actually, in the version of the Lemma stated in [10], the function b does not
depend on w and the function d does not depend on y. However, it can be easily checked
that the proof of [10] can be immediately extended to the setting of Lemma 2.3.

We will construct a solution to problem (15) by considering a sequence of approximate

solutions with strictly positive boundary data.

In the unbounded domain R+ × (0, Y ), like in the classical Prandtl equation, one
would simply shift the initial data slightly to the left. In our case, we must also account
for the right-hand border. What we do is we truncate the domain.

From now on, we assume that the condition λ0(ψ0)′ν−1/3 > 3p27/4 is satisﬁed, so

that the function a(y), the ﬁrst positive root of the polynomial Py, is well-deﬁned. Let
ε > 0 be small. We consider the approximate domain

Dε = {(ψ, y) ∈ R2 | 0 < y < Y and 0 < ψ < ψ0(y) − 2ε},

its parabolic boundary

Γε = {(ψ, y) ∈ Dε | ψ = 0 or y = 0 or ψ = ψ0(y) − 2ε}

and the approximate boundary-value problem

where µ(s) = ν(0)2pw0(s)w′′0(s) + 2(ψ0(0) − s), which is O(s) when s → 0 by (16). The
right-hand boundary condition replicates our expectation, which stems from the study of
ODE (3), that wε(ψ, y) will resemble a(y)2(ψ0(y)−ψ−ε)2. Let us denote the approximate

The goal of the next section will be to prove the following uniform bounds on solutions

of the approximate equations.

Proposition 2.4. There exist constants δ, C0 > 0 such that, for every 0 ≤ y ≤ Y :

in the zone 0 < ψ < δ, there exist A± > 0 and

exist C1 functions C±(y) with 0 < C−(y) < a(y) < C +(y), E±(y) > 0, such that
for ε > 0 small enough,

C−(y)2(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε)2 + wε

• and in the middle zone δ ≤ ψ ≤ ψ0(y) − δ,

C−1
0 ≤ wε(ψ, y) ≤ C0,
|∂ywε(ψ, y)|, |∂ψwε(ψ, y)| ≤ C0.
All the parameters deﬁned in the proposition depend on Y .

Remark. In the above proposition, the functions C±(y) can be chosen as close to a(y)
as desired. Choosing C± close to a will simply reduce the size of the zone in which (21)
is valid, δ. In a similar way, the functions E± can be chosen as close to 2a2 as desired.

In the case of the L∞ bounds, we will create functions Φ−ε (resp. Φ+

and LΦ−ε ≤ Lwε (resp. LΦ+

Notations. From here, to condense the writing, we will use the symbols ±, ≷ and ≶.
In equalities or estimates involving these combined symbols, we mean that the property
with just the upper symbols is true, and that, respectively, the property with just the lower
symbols is also true.

For example, the above discussion on Φ−ε and Φ+

ε can be abridged as follows: we
construct Φ±ε such that Φ±ε ≷ wε on the parabolic boundary of Dε, and LΦ±ε ≷ Lwε on
Dε. Lemma 2.3 (b) implies that Φ±ε ≷ wε on Dε.

3 Derivation of a priori bounds on the approximate

problem

3.1 L∞ bounds
The derivation of L∞ bounds is in two steps:

• First, we construct sub- and super-solutions which will not have the precise desired
behaviour near the boundaries, but that are global on the interval [0, Y ]. We will
refer to these functions as “blanket sub-/super-solutions”.

• Then we construct reﬁned sub- and super-solutions close to the right-hand bound-
ary. This construction is local in y, but the blankets will cover the shortcomings:
thanks to the a priori global bounds derived in the ﬁrst step, we are able to iterate
our construction and to get a control of wε close to the right-hand boundary over
the whole interval [0, Y ].

We start with a result which we will use throughout this paragraph, and which high-

lights the behaviour of wε close to the right-hand boundary.

Proposition 3.1. Assume that inf y λ0(ψ0)′(y)ν(y)−1/3 > 3p27/4. Consider C1 functions
C±(y) such that for all y ∈ [0, Y ],

0 < C−(y) < a(y) < C +(y) <

2λ0(ψ0)′(y)

3ν(y)

,

and deﬁne

W ±ε

:= C±(y)2(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε)2 + (wε

r(y) − C±(y)2ε2).

Then there exist γ± ≷ 0 and δ± > 0 such that for all ε > 0 suﬃciently small, on the

domain

there holds

{(ψ, y) | 0 ≤ y ≤ Y, ψ0(y) − δ± ≤ ψ ≤ ψ0(y) − 2ε},

LW ±ε ≷ (2 + γ±)(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε).

Furthermore, if C−(y) is chosen in a neighbourhood of zero, then γ− < −γ0 and

δ > δ0, for some universal positive constants γ0, δ0.

13

Proof. We have

LW ±ε = 2(cid:16)λ0ν(y)(ψ0)′(y)(C±)2 − ν(y)2(C±)3(cid:17)(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε)

+2λ0ν(C±)′(y)C±(y)(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε)2 + λ0ν[∂ywε
and the main property we want is, taking the top line of (22),

r(y) − 2(C±)′(y)C±(y)ε2],
(22)

λ0ν(y)(ψ0)′(y)(C±)2 − ν(y)2(C±)3 − 1 = −Py(C±) ≷ 0.

As λ0(ψ0)′(y)/ν−1/3 is assumed to be larger than 3p27/4, Py has two positive roots, the
ﬁrst of which is a(y), and −Py is increasing on [0, 2λ0(ψ0)′(y)/(3ν(y))]. As a result,
providing C + is taken strictly between the functions a(y) and 2λ0(ψ0)′(y)/(3ν(y)), and
that we choose 0 < C−(y) < a(y), we get, for some γ+ > 0 and γ− < 0,

2(cid:16)λ0ν(y)(ψ0)′(y)(C±)2 − ν(y)2(C±)3(cid:17) ≷ 2 + 2γ±.

Notice that the functions C± can be chosen to be as regular as desired, and that if C− is
in a neighbourhood of zero, then γ− < −1/2.
and of wε
at a higher order than the ﬁrst line of (22). We therefore choose δ± so that

We now consider the lower order terms, i.e. the ones involving the derivatives of C±
r. First, notice that 2λ0ν(y)(C±)′(y)C±(y)(ψ0(y)− ψ− ε)2 vanishes at ψ0(y)− ε

δ± ≤ inf

.

Once again, if C− is in a suﬃciently small neighbourhood of zero in C1([0, Y ]), one can
take δ− = 1.

Then, we recall that ∂ywε

r(y) = 2a(y)a′(y)w0(ψ0(0) − ε)/a(0)2 = O(ε2), so

r(y) − 2λ0ν(y)(C±)′(y)C±(y)ε2(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Cε2 ≤ |γ±|

LW ±ε ≷ (2 + γ±)(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε).

3.1.1 “Blanket” sub- and super-solutions

Let δ0 > 0 to be chosen later, and we divide Dε into three zones:

I = {0 < ψ < δ0}
II = {δ0 ≤ ψ ≤ ψ0(y) − δ0}
III = {ψ0(y) − δ0 < ψ < ψ0(y) − 2ε},

and (hI, hII, hIII) a partition of unity such that hI is nonincreasing, hIII is nondecreasing,
hI ≡ 1 in zone I, hIII ≡ 1 in zone III, and hII ≡ 1 in the set
{(ψ, y) ∈ II | 2δ0 ≤ ψ ≤ ψ0(y) − 2δ0}.

14

We shall see that we will be able to use Ole˘inik and Samokhin’s constructs on the ﬁrst
two zones, while in the third zone, the blanket sub-solution will be given by W −ε with C−
small. This smallness is required to control the transition between zones II and III.

Proposition 3.2. Assume that a solution to problem (20) exists.

• There exists a constant M , depending only on Y , kw0k∞, ψ0 and ν, such that

wε(ψ, y) ≤ M ,

∀(ψ, y) ∈ Dε.

• Deﬁne a function w−ε by

w−ε (ψ, y) = hI (ψ)(cid:2)wε

l (y) +(cid:0)Aψ4/3 + Bψ(cid:1) e−α0y(cid:3)

+hII(ψ, y)Me−α0y
+hIII(ψ, y)W −ε ,

(23)

with the positive parameters A, B, M and α0.
Then one can choose the numbers A, B, M , δ0 and C− (entering the deﬁnition of
W −ε ; this can actually be chosen constant in y) small enough, and α0 large enough,
so that

Lw−ε ≤ 2(ψ0 − ψ − ε) in Dε and w−ε ≤ wε on Γε.

As a consequence, with this choice of parameters, we have w−ε ≤ wε on Dε.

Proof. Uniform super-solution. Let us start with the upper bound M. Consider the
function

for some ζ0 > 0. Then ϕ ≥ wε on Γε provided ε is small enough, and

ϕ(ψ, y) := 1 + kw0k∞ + ζ0y,

Lϕ = λ0νζ0.

Hence Lϕ ≥ 2(ψ0 − ψ − ε) as soon as ζ0 ≥ supy∈(0,Y ) 2ψ0/(λ0ν). Now, setting

M := 1 + kw0k∞ + Y sup
y∈(0,Y )

2ψ0

,

(24)

we infer that wε ≤ M in Dε.

We now address the computations on the sub-solution w−ε .
Boundary constraints. By construction, w−ε = wε on the left- and right-hand

boundaries, {ψ = 0} and {ψ = ψ0(y)}. On {y = 0}, close to ψ = 0, we have

wε(ψ, 0) = w0(ε + ψ) ≃ w0(ε) + w′0(ε)ψ + O(ψ2) = wε

l (0) + w′0(0)ψ + O(εψ + ψ2),

and therefore, for any choice of A > 0, 0 < B < w′0(0), there exists δ0 > 0 depending on
A, B such that Aψ4/3 + Bψ ≤ wε in {y = 0 , 0 < ψ < 2δ0} for ε suﬃciently small (we
take the interval [0, 2δ0] to ensure a good overlap when transitioning into zone II). We
now consider the boundary condition for y = 0 and ψ close to ψ0(0). There, we have

w−ε (ψ, 0) = C−(0)2(ψ0(0) − ψ − ε)2 + (w0(ψ0 − ε) − C−(0)2ε2),

15

and there exists ¯ψ ∈ [ψ + ε, ψ0(0) − ε] ⊂ [ψ0(0) − 2δ0, ψ0(0)] such that
w−ε (ψ, 0) − wε(ψ, 0) = C−(0)2(cid:0)ψ0(0) − ψ − ε(cid:1)2 − C−(0)2ε2
w′′0( ¯ψ)(cid:19)(cid:0)ψ0(0) − ψ − 2ε(cid:1)2

+w0(ψ0(0) − ε) − w0(ε + ψ)

2

+(cid:0)2εC−(0)2 + w′0(ψ0(0) − ε)(cid:1)(cid:0)ψ0(0) − ψ − 2ε(cid:1) .

The compatibility condition (17) entails that w′′0(ψ0(0)) = 2a(0)2, and therefore w′0(ψ) ∼
−2a(0)2(ψ0(0) − ψ) for |ψ − ψ0(0)| ≪ 1. As a consequence, for ε and δ0 small enough,
we have, if C−(0) < a(0) and ψ > ψ0(y) − 2δ0,

C−(0)2 −

2

w′′0( ¯ψ) < 0,

2εC−(0)2 + w′0(ψ0(0) − ε) < 0.

Thus, w−ε (ψ, 0) ≤ wε(ψ, 0) on {y = 0, ψ0(0) − δ0 < ψ < ψ0(0) − 2ε}. In the middle zone
{y = 0, δ0 < ψ < ψ0 − δ0}, we have w−ε ≤ wε if we have, for example,

M ≤

and ε small enough. This ensures that the total construction w−ε

is smaller than wε
0

In what follows, we choose C− small enough so that δ0 does not need to be changed,

as per Proposition 3.1. However, we are yet to set α0.

Interior, zones I and II. We now need to choose the parameters so that

Lw−ε ≤ Lwε = 2(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε).

in which T , the “transition term”, contains derivatives of the partition of unity, which
are nonzero only in {δ0 < ψ < 2δ0} and {ψ0(y) − 2δ0 < ψ < ψ0(y) − δ0}.
precisely, using the fact that

The two ﬁrst terms are negative, and therefore, for ε suﬃciently small, the right-hand
side of the inequality is negative on [0, 2δ0].

Zone II can be broken down into three parts: the ﬁrst transition zone

the main middle part where hII = 1, and the second transition zone,

ωI = {δ0 < ψ < 2δ0},

ωIII = {ψ0(y) − 2δ0 < ψ < ψ0(y) − δ0}.

In the middle part, we just have Lw−ε = −λ0α0ν(y)Me−α0y ≤ 0, hence we can choose
any α0 ≥ 0 for the moment, but this parameter will play an important role in the
transition mechanism.

Transition area ωI . In the area ωI, we have hI 6= 0, so we should consider the ﬁrst
two lines of (26) and the transition term T . Since the partition only depends on ψ in ωI,
we have that

T (ψ, y) = −ν(y)2pw−ε ∂2

As a consequence, we infer that there exists a constant K1 = K1(M, A, B) such that for
ε suﬃciently small,

T (ψ, y) ≤ K1e−3α0y/2(cid:0)|∂ψhI| + |∂2

ψhI|(cid:1) .

ψhI vanish for ψ = δ0, by continuity and using (27), there exist

Now, since ∂ψhI and ∂2
δ′ > 0 such that for ψ ∈ [δ0, δ′]

We now consider ψ ∈ [δ0 +δ′, 2δ0]. On this set, there exists positive constants kδ0,δ′, Kδ0,δ′
such that 1 − hI ≥ kδ0,δ′, and

Hence, on this set, we have

|∂ψhI| + |∂2

ψhI| ≤ Kδ0,δ′.

Lw−ε < −kδ0,δ′λ0α0ν(y)Me−α0y + K1Kδ0,δ′e−3α0y/2.

Thus we can choose α0 large (depending on all the other parameters), such that the
right-hand side of the above inequality is negative for all y ∈ [0, Y ].
look at zone III and its transition zone ωIII.

So far, this is essentially the same construction and method as in [10]. It remains to

17

Interior, zone III. In zone III, choosing C−(y) small enough, we have, according

to Proposition 3.1,

for some γ ≥ 1/2.

Lw−ε = LW −ε ≤ (2 − γ)(ψ0 − ψ − ε)

(29)

Transition area ωIII. Here, we observe a transition in the mechanism of being a
sub-solution, going from one where the behaviour of Lw−ε is driven by the derivative of
e−α0y, to one which is governed algebraically by the polynomial Py.

Using the previous estimates, we have, since hII + hIII = 1 in this area,
Lw−ε − 2(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε) ≤ (1 − hIII) (−λ0ν(y)α0M e−α0y − 2 (ψ0 − ψ − ε))

−γhIII(ψ0 − ψ − ε) + T,

and the transition term T is given in ωIII by

(30)

(31)

Notice that in ωIII,

T = (cid:0)ν(y)λ0∂yhIII − ν(y)2pw−ε ∂2
−2ν(y)2pw−ε ∂ψhIII∂ψW −ε .
0 + O(ε2),

0 ≤ W −ε ≤ 4C−(y)2δ2

ψhIII(cid:1) (W −ε − Me−α0y)

|∂ψW −ε | ≤ 4C−(y)2δ0,

and therefore, choosing C− suﬃciently small (depending on M , α0 and Y ), we can always
require that

Once again, we recall that choosing such a function C− has no impact on γ or δ0. Thus
there exists a constant K2, depending only on λ0, ν and M , such that

W −ε , |∂ψW −ε | ≤ M e−α0y

in ωIII.

|T (ψ, y)| ≤ K2(cid:0)|∂yhIII| + |∂ψhIII| + |∂2

ψhIII|(cid:1) e−α0y.

ψhIII, we can pick δ′′ > 0 independently of y so

(32)

By continuity of ∂yhIII, ∂ψhIII and ∂2
that, on the set

ω′′ = {ψ0(y) − δ0 − δ′′ ≤ ψ ≤ ψ0(y) − δ0},

we have hIII ≥ 1/2 and

|T| ≤

γ
2

hIII(ψ0 − ψ − ε).

(33)

Therefore, on the set ω′′, we have

(34)
On the other hand, there exist kδ0,δ′′, Kδ0,δ′′ > 0 such that for all (ψ, y) ∈ ωIII\ω′′, we
have 1 − hIII(ψ, y) ≥ kδ0,δ′′ and

Lw−ε − 2(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε) ≤ 0.

|T| ≤ Kδ0,δ′′e−α0y.

So we have

Lw−ε − 2(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε) ≤ [−λ0να0kδ0,δ′′ + Kδ0,δ′′] e−α0y,

and, choosing α0 > 0 large enough, depending on δ0 and δ′′, the right-hand side becomes
negative. Estimate (34) extends to all of ωIII, thus it is proved on Dε.

Conclusion. The function w−ε satisﬁes the hypotheses of Lemma 2.3 (b) relative to

wε. As a result, the proposition is proved.

3.1.2 Precise behaviour

In this part, we aim to prove that wε(ψ, y) ∼ a(y)2(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε)2 near the right-hand
boundary. To do so, we will take δ ≤ δ0, so that Proposition 3.2 holds. Thanks to this
property, we know that there exist positive parameters M−, M +, A− and B− (depending
on δ) such that

in zone II, and

M− ≤ w−ε (ψ, y) ≤ wε(ψ, y) ≤ M +

l (y) + A−ψ4/3 + B−ψ ≤ w−ε (ψ, y) ≤ wε(ψ, y) ≤ M +
wε

in zone I. These parameters depend on those in Proposition 3.2, for instance

M− ≤ M e−α0Y .

Some, such as B− ≤ Be−α0Y and M + = M , do not degrade with δ. The goal now is to
prove the precise behaviour in zone III.

Proposition 3.3. For any γ > 0, there exist

• functions C±(y) ∈ C1([0, Y ]) as in Proposition 3.2 with γ± = ±2γ, and ka −

C±kW 1,∞ ≤ Kγ for some universal constant K;

• a positive number δ satisfying δ ≤ min(δ0, δ−, δ+), where δ0 is from Proposition 3.2

and δ± are from Proposition 3.1,

• a positive parameter α,
• and a positive number y1 which depends on all of the above but not on ε,

such that the functions Φ±ε deﬁned hereafter satisfy, for any y0 ∈ [0, Y ],

LΦ±ε ≷ (2 ± γ)(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε)

on the set

Dε
y0,y1 = {(ψ, y) | y0 ≤ y ≤ min(Y, y0 + y1) , 0 ≤ ψ ≤ ψ0(y) − 2ε}.

The functions are:

Φ+

ε (ψ, y) = (hI + hII)(ψ, y)M +eα(y−y0) + hIII(ψ, y)W +
ε

Φ−ε (ψ, y) = hI (ψ)(cid:2)wε

l (y) +(cid:0)A−ψ4/3 + B−ψ(cid:1) e−α(y−y0)(cid:3)

(35)

(36)

where the partition of unity (hI, hII, hIII) is now adapted to the width δ.
Proof. Propositions 3.2 and 3.1 prove that LΦ±ε satisfy the desired inequalities on zones
I, III and II\(ωIII), and that the functions C± can be chosen closer to a as γ becomes
small (continuity of the polynomial Py, combined with the fact that P ′y(a) 6= 0), so we
only need to concentrate on the transition zone ωIII.

Sub-solutions. The diﬀerence with the previous proof is that we can no longer use
the smallness of C− to control the transition term T −, given by (31). Instead of (32), we
have

|T| ≤ K2(|∂yhIII| + |∂ψhIII| + |∂2

ψhIII|)(1 + e−α(y−y0))

for a constant K2 which also depends on δ. While we can continue to use the smallness
of the derivatives of hIII in a δ′′-sized neighbourhood of the set {ψ = ψ0(y) − δ}, we are
unable to control the sign of the quantity

−λ0ν(y)αM−e−α(y−y0)kδ,δ′′ + Kδ,δ′′K2(1 + e−α(y−y0))

on {ψ0 − 2δ ≤ ψ ≤ ψ0 − δ − δ′′} by simply taking α large. Here, we have re-used the
notations kδ,δ′′ and Kδ,δ′′ from the previous proof. We need to assume that e−α(y−y0) is
bounded from below, say, by 1/2. Then, we have

−λ0ναM−e−α(y−y0)hII + |T| ≤ −

1
2

λ0ναM−kδ,δ′′ + 2Kδ,δ′′K2,

which is negative for α large enough. As a result, we see that this estimate is only valid
locally in y, as long as e−α(y−y0) ≥ 1/2, hence on the set Dε
y0,y1 with y1 = ln(2)/α. We
stress, however, that the constants K2, Kδ,δ′′, kδ,δ′′, M− are global, i.e. do not depend on
y0. As a consequence, α and y1 are uniform over the whole interval [0, Y ] and do not
depend on y0 either.

Super-solutions. This time, in the transition zone ωIII, we have the estimate

|T| ≤ K2(|∂yhIII| + |∂ψhIII| + |∂2

ψhIII|)(1 + eα(y−y0) + e3α(y−y0)/2),

in which the power 3/2 of the exponential comes from the nonlinearity (it was negligeable
for subsolutions). This poses diﬃculties for all the estimates in the transition zone. On
one hand, we need to be able to obtain smallness of T in a δ′′-sized region where the
derivatives of hIII are small. We quickly see that δ′′ is going to depend on α if we try
to work globally. On the other hand, we will want to prove that, outside of these small
areas,

λ0ναM +eα(y−y0)hII − |T| ≥ λ0ναM +eα(y−y0)kδ,δ′′ − Kδ,δ′′K2(1 + eα(y−y0) + e3α(y−y0)/2)

≥ 2(ψ0 − ψ − ε).

The negative term in the middle member is dominant for α large.

In both cases, bounding T involves assuming that eα(y−y0) is bounded, for example by
2. Then we can prove (33) again for a neighbourhood of the curve {ψ = ψ0(y) − δ}, and
choose α large enough so that

λ0ναM +eα(y−y0)hII − |T| ≥ λ0ναM +kδ,δ′′ − 7Kδ,δ′′K2 ≥ 2ψ0(y).

Once again, these estimates are valid for y ∈ [y0, y0 + y1], with y1 = ln(2)/α, with α
independent of y0.

Corollary 3.4. Assume that a solution to problem (20) exists. Then for any γ > 0,
there exist a positive number δ > 0 and functions C±(y) ∈ C1([0, Y ]) such that C +(y) >
a(y) > C−(y) and ka − C±kW 1,∞ ≤ Kγ for some universal constant K such that

W −ε (ψ, y) ≤ wε(ψ, y) ≤ W +

ε (ψ, y)

(37)

for all (ψ, y) in zone III.
Proof. We argue by induction. Let Yk := ky1, k ∈ N. Clearly estimate (37) is true for
y = Y0 = 0 and for δ small enough. As a consequence, choosing y0 = Y0 = 0 in (36),
we infer that Φ±ε ≷ wε on the parabolic boundary of Dε
0,y1. According to Proposition 3.3
and Lemma 2.3, Φ±ε ≷ wε on Dε
0,y1, and in particular, estimate (37)
holds in zone III for all y ∈ [Y0, Y1].
Now, assume that estimate (37) is true in zone III for y ∈ [0, Yk] for some k ≥
0 such that Yk < Y . Set y0 = Yk in (36). By deﬁnition of M±, A−, B− and using
our induction hypothesis, we have Φ±ε ≷ wε on the parabolic boundary of Dε
Yk,Y −Yk .
Therefore, according to Proposition 3.3, Φ±ε ≷ wε on Dε
Yk,y1. It follows that estimate (37)
is satisﬁed in zone III for y ∈ [Yk, Yk+1]. By induction, we deduce that estimate (37) is
true over the whole interval [0, Y ].

0,y1., Φ±ε ≷ wε on Dε

Remark. We have obtained that, for every µ > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for
ψ0(y) − δ ≤ ψ ≤ ψ0(y) − 2ε, we have

(a(y)2 ± µ)(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε)2 ≷ wε(ψ, y),

which, assuming convergence (which we prove later), proves the right-hand boundary be-
haviour w(ψ, y) ∼ a(y)2(ψ0(y) − ψ)2 as ψ approaches ψ0(y).
Lemma 3.5 (Existence of solutions). For every Y > 0, there exists a classical solution
to (20) on Dε, which is positive on Dε.

Proof. Since we have shown above that a solution, if it exists, is positive, we can view
(20) as a quasilinear parabolic equation with a strictly positive viscosity (for ε > 0 ﬁxed)
and apply classical results. This step is identical to [10] Lemma 2.1.7.

Eventually, we have the following control from above close to the left-hand boundary:
Lemma 3.6. Let wε be the solution of (20) on Dε. Then there exist B+ > 0, A+ > 0
and δ > 0 that

wε(ψ, y) ≤ wε

l (y) + B+ψ − A+ψ4/3

for all y ∈ [0, Y ] and for all ψ ∈ [0, δ].
Proof. The proof is identical to part of the proof of Lemma 2.1.8 in [10], and therefore
we only recall the main arguments. We construct super-solutions of the form

Θ+
ε (ψ, y) = wε(0, y) + (B+ψ − A+ψ4/3)eαy,

ε (ψ) ≥ wε

with B+ > w′0(0) and A+ > 0, so that Θ+
ε (ψ, 0) reaches the value M + at ψ = ψ1 <
ψ0(0)/4 and Θ+
0(ψ) for all ψ ∈ [0, ψ1]. Then, in the same way as the blanket
sub-solution was dealt with in zones I and II, it is possible to choose α > 0 large enough
so that LΘ+
ε ≥ wε on the set {0 ≤ y ≤ Y , 0 ≤ ψ ≤ ψ1},
which yields a bound on the diﬀerence quotient and therefore on pε|ψ=0. Then, up to a
renaming of the coeﬃcients A+, B+, we have the desired result.

ε (ψ, y) ≥ 2ψ0(y), and so Θ+

3.2 Lipschitz bounds

We will now look for estimates on pε := ∂ψwε and qε := ∂ywε. Bounds for these quantities
are obtained in zones I and II in the same way as in [10], and by a similar argument to
above, we isolate what goes on in zone III and deal with it separately.

We start with the estimates on pε:

Proposition 3.7. There exists a uniform constant C, depending only on λ0, ψ0, ν and
Y , such that

Furthermore, there exist δ > 0 and functions E±(y) > 0 such that for all (ψ, y) such that
ψ0(y) − δ ≤ ψ ≤ ψ0(y) − 2ε,

|∂ψwε| ≤ C in Dε.

− E−(y)(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε) ≤ pε(ψ, y) ≤ −E+(y)(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε).

Proof. The equation on pε is the following:

( λ0ν(y)∂ypε − ν(y)2

2√wε pε∂ψpε − ν(y)2√wε∂2

ψpε = −2
pε|y=0 = (wε

0)′(ε + ψ).

(38)

(39)

The sub- and super-solutions constructed in Propositions 3.2 and 3.3 and Lemma 3.6

ensure that

−2C +(y)2ε ≤ pε

0 < B− ≤ pε

|ψ=0 ≤ B+,
|ψ=ψ0(y)−2ε ≤ −2C−(y)2ε.

Therefore there exists a uniform constant K0 (depending on B±, C±, w0 and Y ) such
that |pε| ≤ K0 on Γε. Then it is easily checked that K0 (resp. −K0 − 2y/λ0) is a super-
(resp. a sub-) solution of (39). Therefore, according to Lemma 2.3, which does apply to
the operator M associated with the equation, which is

Mf = λ0ν(y)∂yf −

ν(y)2

we have

− K0 −

2y
λ0 ≤ pε ≤ K0 in Dε,

(40)

and the uniform bound is proved.

It only remains to prove the reﬁned bound close to the right-hand boundary. We use
the same method as in Proposition 3.3, with the only diﬀerence that we do not need to
distinguish between zones I and II. More precisely, we deﬁne

π±(ψ, y) := ±(1 − hIII)(cid:18)K0 +

2Y

λ0(cid:19) eζy − hIIIE±(y)(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε),

for ζ > 0 suﬃciently large and for some positive functions E± to be chosen so that
π±(ψ, y) ≷ pε on Γε, and Mπ± ≷ −2. The inequalities π±(ψ, y) ≷ pε are satisﬁed on
the right-hand boundary {ψ = ψ0 − 2ε} as soon as 0 < E+(y) < 2C−(y)2 and E−(y) >

22

2C+(y)2. We now compute Mπ± to get the other constraint: setting C0 := K0 + 2Y /λ0,
we have

where the term T ′ is, as in the proof of Proposition 3.3, a transition term involving
derivatives of hIII. We ﬁrst focus on the last line. Using Proposition 3.3, we note that
r(y) ∼ a(y)ε2 ≶ C±(y)2ε2, so that √wε is surrounded by C±(ψ0 − ψ − ε), and thus
wε
ψ0−ψ−ε
is O(1). The third term inside the brackets in (42) is of lower order, and can be
2√wε
dealt with by taking some margin on E± and eventually adjusting δ. Thus we leave it
aside for the time being and we will explain the details later.

According to Proposition 3.3, we have

(43)

for some γ > 0. Given that C±(y) are close to a(y), let us focus on the polynomial

Qy(E) =

ν(y)2
2a(y)

E2 − λ0ν(y)(ψ0)′(y)E + 2.

We would like Qy(E±) ≷ ±γ. As Q′y(0) < 0, we can choose E+(y) positive and small,
for instance. As for E−, we make the following observations. First, notice that 2a(y)2
is always a root of Qy. Hence the other root of Qy is 2/(a(y)ν(y)2). We want E−(y) to
belong to the interval whose bounds are 2a(y)2 and 2/(a(y)ν(y)2), so that Qy(E−(y)) < 0.
This is possible and coherent with the boundary constraint E−(y) > 2a(y)2 if and only
if 2a(y)2 < 2/(a(y)ν(y)2), i.e. a(y) < ν(y)−2/3. Noticing that

Py(ν(y)−2/3) = 2 − ν(y)−1/3λ0(ψ0)′(y),

it suﬃces that Py(ν−2/3) > 0 to have the desired inequality between a and ν, given the
variations of Py. This yields the condition

λ0(ψ0)′(y)
ν(y)1/3 > 2,

23

which is the one we announced in the statement of Theorem 1.1. Hence, if this is satisﬁed,
we ﬁrst choose the continuous function C +(y) in Proposition 3.3 so that

a(y)2 < C +(y)2 < 1/(a(y)ν(y)2)

for all y, and then, by continuity, we can choose E−(y) so that 2(C +)2 < E− < 2/(aν2).
Thus (43) is satisﬁed for E−, provided C− is chosen suﬃciently close to a.

At this stage, we have proved that

Mπ± ≷ ±ζλ0C0ν(1 − hIII)eζy − hIII(1 − hIII)±C0ν 2eζy

(44)

Now, choosing δ suﬃciently small (depending on γ), we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)λ0ν(E±)′(ψ0 − ψ − ε)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤

γ
2

,

∀(ψ, y) ∈ {ψ0(y) − 2δ, ψ0(y) − 2ε}.

Furthermore, provided ζ is suﬃciently large (depending on δ, E± and C±), the ﬁrst term
on the ﬁrst line of (44) can absorb the others (bar T ′) and still be ≷ (−2± γ/2)(1− hIII ).
The transition term T ′ is treated exactly as T was in the zone ωIII in Proposition 3.3.
With δ now ﬁxed, we will obtain a control of T ′ which is local in y, and we notice that we
can cover Dε with a ﬁnite number of these local estimates thanks to the global bounds
on pε in (40). Since the arguments are identical to the ones of Proposition 3.3, we leave
them to the reader.

Remark. Notice that

E+(y) < 2C−(y)2 < 2a(y)2 < 2C +(y)2 < E−(y),

and that one can take for instance C±(y) = a(y) ± µ, E±(y) = 2(a(y) ± 2µ)2, for any
µ > 0 small enough. As emphasised before, the constant δ then depends on µ.

We now address the estimates on qε = ∂ywε. We ﬁrst give uniform estimates in zones

I and II, which are proved in [10]. We brieﬂy recall the main arguments of the proof.

Lemma 3.8 ([10], Lemmata 2.1.8 to 2.1.13). Let δ > 0 be arbitrary. The function qε is
uniformly bounded in ε on

∆δ := {(ψ, y) | 0 ≤ y ≤ Y and 0 ≤ ψ ≤ ψ0(y) − δ},

and there exists β ∈ (0, 1/2) such that (wε)β−1∂ywε is bounded uniformly in ε on ∆δ.
Proof. First, standard parabolic regularity estimates from [6] yield uniform bounds for qε
in zone II, since in that zone wε is bounded away from zero uniformly in ε and uniformly
Lipschitz continuous with respect to ψ according to Proposition 3.7. Hence it remains
to look at a neighbourhood of the left-hand boundary. Using equation (15), we ﬁnd that
the equation on qε = ∂ywε is

It can be easily checked that this equation has a minimum principle, in the sense that
if qε has a negative minimum in Dδ, then it is possible to bound its value from below.
Furthermore, on the left-hand boundary ψ = 0, we have

|ψ=0 = ∂ywε
qε

l (y) = µ(ε)eµ(ε)y/w0(ε) = O(ε),

and therefore qε is bounded on the left-hand boundary, which leads to an overall lower
bound for qε. However, the nature of the nonlinearity in the equation on qε makes a similar
maximum principle impossible to prove (we will make this remark again shortly). Ole˘inik
and Samokhin then use a nonlinear change of unknown to make a maximum principle
appear on a modiﬁed equation, allowing them to bound √wε∂2
ψwε, and therefore qε by
simply using the equation. They ﬁnally show a bound for (wε)β−1qε for β ∈ (0, 1/2),
which we saw the usefulness of in the proof of Corollary 2.2.

We now seek the explicit and precise behaviour of qε in zone III. As it was shown
in Proposition 3.3 that wε would vanish quadratically at ψ = ψ0(y) − ε, we expect qε to
decay linearly. We prove the following.

Proposition 3.9. There exists a constant C0 > 0 such that
|qε(ψ, y)| ≤ C0(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε),

(46)

for all (ψ, y) ∈ Dε such that ψ ≥ ψ0(y) − δ.
Proof. As mentioned before, if qε has an interior minimum qε
that

(qε

min)2(cid:19) ≥ −C,

min ≥ − ¯Q, for some constant ¯Q depending only on
for some constant C, and therefore qε
the data, and independent of ε. However, it is impossible to do the same for an interior
maximum, due to the zero-order nonlinearity, in which, when one examines a positive
maximum, qε and −(qε)2 have opposite signs. One way around this is to make a nonlinear
change of unknown. In [10] Lemma 2.1.12, Ole˘inik and Samokhin set ∂ψw = ϕ(S) (the
function ϕ is essentially exponential), and examine √w∂ψS, which gives them a bound
on √w∂2
ψw = ∂yw according to the equation. However, we are looking for more than just
a bound on qε, we are seeking a more precise behaviour in zone III. Rather, we consider
the unknown

rε = −

qε
pε = −

∂ywε
∂ψwε .

We can do this because we have inequality (38), which implies that −pε > 0 in zone III.
We will show that rε is uniformly bounded, which will prove that qε = O(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε)
as ψ goes to ψ0(y) − 2ε.

Using equations (39) and (45), we get

λ0ν∂yrε =

ν2√wε∂ψpε = ν2√wε∂2

ψwε = λ0νqε − 2(ψ0(y) − ψ − ε).

(49)

Therefore the term in brackets in (48) is zero.

This equation has a maximum and a minimum principle in zone III.
Indeed, let us
consider (ψm, ym) a minimum of rε in zone III deprived from its parabolic boundary.

Then we have ∂yrε ≤ 0, ∂ψrε = 0, √wε∂2

ψrε ≥ 0, and therefore

pε (cid:2)rε − (ψ0)′(ym)(cid:3) + 2λ0χ′χ′′rε + 8

νpε (cid:0)ψ0(ym) − ψm − ε(cid:1) ≤ 0.

χ′χ′′

We can always choose δ so that 1/|pε| ≥ |2λ0χ′χ′′| in zone III, and therefore the second
term is absorbed by the ﬁrst one. The last term is bounded according to Proposition 3.7,
and therefore we obtain a lower bound on rε at a point of interior minimum since pε is
negative:

rε(ψm, ym) ≥ 2(ψ0)′(ym) − 8|χ′(ym)χ′′(ym)|

26

It remains to examine the boundary conditions for rε in zone III. Thanks to the
compatibility conditions (16) and (17), equation (20) is valid up to the boundary, and we
have

λ0ν(0)qε|y=0 = ν(0)2pwε

0(wε

0)′′ + 2(ψ0(0) − ψ − ε),

which, given the compatibility condition (17), becomes, as ψ → ψ0(0) − 2ε,
λ0ν(0)qε|y=0 ∼ 2(ν(0)2a(0)3 + 1)(ψ0(0) − ψ − ε) = 2λ0ν(0)(ψ0)′(0)a(0)2(ψ0(0) − ψ − ε),
since a(0) solves P0(a(0)) = 0. As a result, because of the initial condition on pε, seen in
(39), rε

|y=0 is bounded in zone III.

To get the boundary condition on {ψ = ψ0(y) − 2ε}, we diﬀerentiate with respect to

y the identity

wε(ψ0(y) − 2ε, y) = w0(ψ0(0) − ε)

a(y)2
a(0)2 ,

∀y ∈ (0, Y ).

We get the relation

2a′(y)a(y)

w0(ψ0(0) − ε)

a(0)2

= [(ψ0)′(y)pε + qε]|ψ=ψ0(y)−2ε.

We proved that −E−(y)ε ≤ pε
O(ε2), so the left-hand side is of lower order. We obtain

ψ=ψ0−2ε ≤ −E+(y)ε on the boundary, while w0(ψ0(0)− ε) =

rε|ψ=ψ0(y)−2ε = (ψ0)′(y) + O(ε).

Finally, we know by the Schauder estimates that rε is uniformly bounded along the curve
{ψ = ψ0(y) − δ}.
Combining the interior extremum bounds and the boundary conditions, we get that
rε is uniformly bounded in zone III, which ends the proof of (46) and Proposition 3.9.

4 Solution to the transformed equation and unique-

ness

We come to the ﬁnal stage of the proof of Proposition 2.1. We ﬁrst tackle the existence:
for every set K that is compact in D, which we recall is

D = {(ψ, y) ∈ R2 | 0 < y < Y and 0 < ψ < ψ0(y)},

we have uniform Lipschitz bounds for the family of solutions (wε)ε≤ε0, so we can extract
a subsequence that converges uniformly to w by the Ascoli theorem. Moreover, the
parabolic regularity gives us convergence of the derivatives on K. The behaviour of
the sub- and super-solutions Φ±ε yield continuity of w and its ﬁrst derivatives on D, so w
vanishes linearly at ψ = 0 with a positive derivative there, as per the blanket sub-solution,
and quadratically along the curve {ψ = ψ0(y)}, with the precise behaviour being shown
in Proposition 3.3.

It remains to show the uniqueness of classical solutions of (15) with the properties
listed in Proposition 2.1. The arguments are similar to Theorem 2.1.15 in [10]. In fact,
we prove uniqueness in a slightly larger class, namely

27

Proposition 4.1. Assume that w1, w2 are two classical solutions of (15) such that for
i = 1, 2

for some positive constant C0. Then w1 = w2.

Let us ﬁrst derive some bounds on

√w1 + √w2

ψw2(w1 − w2) = (√w1 − √w2)∂2
near the boundaries. We ﬁrst notice that for each i, √wi∂2
ψwi is bounded in D by
assumption. Furthermore, according to the inequalities satisﬁed by w1 and w2 near the
left-hand and right-hand boundaries, it is easily checked that w1/w2 is also bounded
(and bounded away from zero) in the vicinity of these boundaries. The boundedness of

ψw2

(√w1 − √w2)∂2

ψw2 follows.

However, since (√w1 + √w2)−1∂2

ψw2 is not expected to be bounded near the bound-
aries, we cannot conclude immediately with a Gr¨onwall-type argument. To reduce to a
case where this coeﬃcient would be bounded, we consider the linear operator

Nτ f = λ0ν∂yf − ν2√w1∂2

where Fτ (ψ, y) = (

if ψ ≥ τ and ψ ≤ ψ0(y) − τ
otherwise,

with τ to be chosen shortly. Let us deﬁne a crude super-solution of the equation Nτ f = 0,
namely

˜Φ+(ψ, y) = eαyhhI(A+ψ4/3 + B+ψ) + hIIM + + hIII(ψ0 − ψ)5/6i,

with A+, B+, M + and δ so that the function in large brackets is larger than wε. This is
crude in the sense that its decay at ψ = ψ0(y) is slower than O((ψ0 − ψ)2). Using the
sub- and super-solutions from Proposition 3.3 that surround w1, we see that

Nτ ˜Φ+ ≥ kψ−1/6 and Nτ ˜Φ+ ≥ k(ψ0 − ψ)−1/6

in zones I and III respectively (adjust δ if needed), and then choose α large enough to
ensure Nτ ˜Φ+ > 0 in zone II. Because of transition terms, we may have to act locally in
y, but by choosing the parameters large enough, we can re-use the “blanket” strategy to
cover all of D.

Let µ > 0, and consider the functions

W ± = µ ˜Φ+ ± (w1 − w2).

28

We will show that both of these functions are non-negative, hence, for any µ > 0,

|w1 − w2| ≤ µ ˜Φ+,

proving that w1 = w2.

We have

Nτ W ± = µNτ ˜Φ+ ± Nτ (w1 − w2)

for some positive constant m independent of the parameters, if τ is small enough (τ
depends on µ).

If w1 6= w2 at a certain point, then, at that point, either W + or W − is negative
for µ small enough. First of all, we note that it must be an interior point of D, since
w1 = w2 = 0 on the boundary, and ˜Φ+ is zero on the left- and right-hand boundaries,
and is positive at y = 0. Next, W ± can be negative if and only if R± = W ±eκy can be,
for any κ > 0. We quickly compute that

Nτ W ± = e−κyhNτ R± − λ0νκR±i
= e−κyhλ0ν∂yR± − ν2√w1∂2

ψR± − (Fτ + λ0νκ)R±i,

and recall that this quantity is positive. But, if R± has a negative minimum, and λ0νκ
is larger than max|Fτ|, we see that Nτ W ± ≤ 0 at that minimum. So R± cannot be
negative, and the uniqueness for problem (15) is proved. (cid:3)

We then infer uniqueness for the Prandtl equation in an appropriate class.

Corollary 4.2. Consider a Lipschitz solution (u, v) of (1) such that ∂ξξv is bounded in
[0, Y ] × R+, and such that there exist ξ0 > 0, m, M > 0 such that
mξ ≤ v(ξ, y) ≤ Mξ ∀ξ ∈ [0, ξ0], ∀y ∈ [0, Y ]

and

Then (u, v) is unique.

v(ξ, y) ∼ a(y)(ψ0(y) − ξ) as ξ → ∞.

Proof. We can see in our computations in section 2 that there is an equivalence between
solutions v of the Prandtl equation (9) that are Lipschitz-class, with a positive derivative
with respect to ξ at ξ = 0, and exponentially decaying as ξ → +∞ on one hand, and

29

solutions w of the transformed equation (15) that are Lipschitz-class, with positive ψ-
direction derivative at ψ = 0, and vanishing quadratically at ψ = ψ0(y) on the other.
Additionally, the boundedness assumption on ∂ξξv means that √w∂ψψw is bounded.

Hence, if there are two solutions to the Prandtl equation satisfying the assumptions
of Corollary 4.2, they yield two solutions, in the sense of Proposition 4.1, of (15) by the
von Mises transform, and these have just been shown to be equal. This ends the proof
of Corollary 4.2 and thereby of Theorem 1.1.
