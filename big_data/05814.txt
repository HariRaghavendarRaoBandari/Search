Particles of low velocity, travelling without dissipation in a superﬂuid, can interact and emit sound
when they collide. We propose a minimal model in which the equations of motion of the particles,
including a short-range repulsive force, are self-consistently coupled with the Gross-Pitaevskii equa-
tion. We use this model to demonstrate the existence of an eﬀective superﬂuid-mediated attractive
interaction between the particles; and we study numerically the collisional dynamics of particles
as a function of their incident kinetic energy and the length-scale of the repulsive force. We ﬁnd
a transition from almost elastic to completely inelastic (sticking) collisions as the parameters are
tuned. We ﬁnd that aggregation and clustering result from this sticking transition in multi-particle
systems.

Studies of an assembly of particles in a superﬂuid have
a rich history [1]. This challenging problem is of rele-
vance to recent experiments on particles in superﬂuid he-
lium [2–6] and impurities in cold-atom Bose-Einstein con-
densates (BECs) [7]. Its understanding requires models
and techniques from the physics of quantum ﬂuids with
state-of-the-art methods from theoretical and numerical
studies of turbulence.
In contrast to particles moving
through a viscous ﬂuid, particles move through a zero-
temperature superﬂuid without dissipation, so long as
they travel at speeds lower than the critical speed above
which the particles shed quantum vortices [8–10]. The
motion of a single particle, which is aﬀected by the su-
perﬂow and acts on it too, has been studied in Ref. [11]
in a Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) superﬂuid. We refer to this
as an active particle.

We go well beyond earlier studies [11–13] of this prob-
lem by developing a minimal model. We introduce ac-
tive and interacting particles in the Gross-Pitaevskii La-
grangian that describes a weakly interacting superﬂuid
at zero temperature. By using this model we show that,
even if particles move through the superﬂuid at subcrit-
ical speeds, they can dissipate energy when they col-
lide, because a two-particle collision excites sound waves;
clearly the coeﬃcient of restitution e < 1,
for such
a collision. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there
is a superﬂuid-mediated attraction between the parti-
cles. We calculate this attraction both approximately,
via a Thomas-Fermi approximation, and numerically,
from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the Gross-
Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). We show that the interplay
between the short-range (SR) particle repulsion, which
we have included in our Lagrangian, and the superﬂuid-
mediated (SM) attraction leads to a sticking transition

at which the coeﬃcient of restitution e for two-particle
collisions vanishes. We develop a simple, mean-ﬁeld the-
ory for this transition and we compare it with our DNS
results. Furthermore, we elucidate the rich dynamical
behaviors of (a) two-particle collisions in the superﬂuid,
when the impact parameter b is nonzero, and (b) as-
semblies of particles, which aggregate because of the SM
attraction.

A = L2; we use a fourth-order, Runge-Kutta scheme for
time marching. We work with the quantum of circula-
tion κ ≡ h/m ≡ 4πα0, speed of sound c = √2α0gρ0, and
healing length ξ = pα0/(gρ0). In all our calculations,

we set ρ0 = 1, c = 1, and ξ = 1.44 dx, where dx = L/Nc,
Nc = 128 is the number of collocation points, µ = g,
Vo = 10 g, dp = 1.5 ξ, and ∆E = 0.062. [See the Supple-
mental Material [16] for details.]

fSR,i arises from the SR repulsive potential (the last
term in Eq. (1)). In the absence of any external force,
the total energy of this system is conserved. More-
over, the dynamical evolution of the coupled set of
Eqs. (2)-(3) conserves the total momentum and the num-
ber of bosons, which constitute the superﬂuid. We
can express the GP in terms of hydrodynamical vari-
ables by using the Madelung transformation ψ(r, t) =

pρ(r, t)/m exp(iφ(r, t)), where ρ(r, t) and φ(r, t) are the
density and phase ﬁelds, respectively; the superﬂuid
velocity is v(r, t) = (/m)∇φ(r, t), which shows that
the motion is irrotational in the absence of any vor-
tices. We represent a particle by the Gaussian potential
VP = Vo exp(−r2/2d2
p); here Vo and dp are the strength
of the potential and its width, respectively. The particle
displaces some superﬂuid with an area of the order of the
particle area; we denote the mass of the displaced super-
ﬂuid by mf . We use the ratio M ≡ mo/mf to deﬁne
three types of particles: (1) heavy (M > 1), (2) neutral
(M = 1), and (3) light (M < 1).
To solve Eq. (2)-(3) numerically, we use a pseudospec-
tral method with the 2/3-dealiasing rule [14, 15], on a
2D, periodic, computational domain of side L = 2π, i.e.,

We ﬁrst examine a head-on, two-particle collision. We
prepare an initial state with two neutral particles, at rest,
separated by r0 = 7 ξ in the superﬂuid [17]. We evolve
this state by using the GPE in the presence of the SR
repulsion between the particles, with rSR = 1.5 ξ, after
they are released from rest at t = 0. In Fig. 1(a) we plot
the particle positions versus the scaled time ct/ξ. In the
insets of Fig. 1(a), we show pseudocolor plots of ρ(r) at
times labeled (i)-(vi); these plots show sound waves after
the collision between the particles, which appear as blue
disks with ρ = 0. We see that the particles accelerate
towards each other and stop on collision, when the sep-
aration r ≃ rSR; and then their motion is reversed, but
they do not escape to inﬁnity and undergo multiple colli-
sions, which are accompanied by acoustic emission, until
they lose their initial kinetic energy and they stick to
form a bound pair; i.e., we have an inelastic collision (see
the spatiotemporal evolution in Video M1, Supplemental
Material [16]).

To characterize the SM attractive potential between
the particles, we write the total energy contained in the

We now perform DNSs, in which we vary the initial
scaled distance r/ξ between the particles; we then ob-
tain EF(r/ξ), the energy of the minimum-energy state
without the SR repulsion, by using the imaginary-time
procedure [17]. In Fig. 1 (b) we plot versus r/ξ the po-
tential UA = EF(r) − EF(r = ∞), which is negative
(i.e., attractive), for small r/ξ, and vanishes in the limit
r/ξ → ∞.
We can estimate UA(r/ξ), for the two-particle case,
by using the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation [18] as
follows. We neglect the kinetic-energy term in Eq. (2)
and write

|ψ(r)|2 = (µ − VP)θ(µ − VP)/g,

energy term in Eq. (2).

We now study two simpliﬁed cases: (1) head-on col-
lisions, with impact parameter b = 0; (2) and colli-
sions with ﬁnite, but small b. The schematic diagram in
Fig. 2 (a) outlines our procedure. We use an initial state

with two stationary particles O1, at (π/2, π), and O2, at
(3π/2, π). We apply the external forces Fext = F0 ˆx and
Fext = −F0 ˆx, respectively, to accelerate the particles;
and then we turn oﬀ Fext at t = t0 (red vertical line in
Fig. 2 (a)). In Fig. 2 (b) we plot versus ct/ξ the x com-
ponents of the particle velocities uo,x(t), from our DNS
with two heavy particles (M = 7.5 and rSR = 1.5 ξ), for
three diﬀerent values of the incident kinetic energy Eo.
For Eo = 1.5 × 10−4 (blue curves in Fig. 2 (b)), the be-
havior of uo,x(t) is similar to that of neutral-particle col-
lisions with SR repulsion (Fig. 1 (a)); the collision is com-
pletely inelastic and the particles form a bound pair; and
the separation between their centers ﬂuctuates around
r ≃ rSR. The time average of the velocities of the parti-
cles is zero, after the collision. Figure 2 (b) shows that,
for Eo = 1.8 × 10−4 (green curves), the two particles re-
bound, with small non-zero, mean velocities; at the time
of the collision, most of the energy is transferred to the re-
pulsive term because of the change in EF(t)− EF(t0) and
Eo (see the Supplemental Material [16]). After the colli-
sion, most of the energy is transferred back to the ﬂuid
and the particles have a small kinetic energy. For higher
values, e.g., Eo = 5.04×10−4 (magenta curves), the head-
on collision between the heavy particles is nearly elastic;
and the particles rebound with velocities that are signif-
icant fractions of their values at incidence (see the spa-
tiotemporal evolution in Videos M2, M3 and M4 in the
Supplemental Material [16]).

We characterize this inelastic-elastic transition by cal-
culating the coeﬃcient of restitution for head-on colli-
sions:

e =

u2,F − u1,F
u1,I − u2,I

,

(8)

where u1,I and u2,I are, respectively, the mean velocities
of the particles O1 and O2 before the collision and u1,F
and u2,F are the mean velocities of these particles after

respectively, with incident kinetic energy Eo ≃ 8.7 × 10−4. For b = 2 ξ and Eo = 9.1 × 10−6, the colliding particles stick to form

heavy particles (M = 7.5) initially placed on a lattice; these are set into motion by the application of constant-in-time forces,
random in magnitude and direction, for a short duration t ≤ t0 ∼ 85. The insets (i)-(iv) illustrate multi-particle collisional
dynamics, at the representative times t(i) = 0 < t(ii) < t(iii) < t(iv) by pseudocolor plots of the density ﬁeld ρ(r); the particles
appear as blue disks in which ρ = 0.

the collision. For the collisions described above, we ﬁnd:
(1) e ≃ 0 for Eo = 1.5 × 10−4; (2) e ≃ 0.24 for Eo =
1.8 × 10−4; and (3) e ≃ 0.68 for Eo = 5.0 × 10−4.
In
Fig. 2 (c) we plot e versus Eo from the two-particle, head-
on collisions. At low values of Eo, the particle collision is
inelastic with e = 0; and, as we increase Eo, e becomes
ﬁnite at a critical value Eo ≃ 1.6 × 10−4, and then there
is a steep increase followed by a slow, asymptotic growth
towards a value close to 1. We observe a similar inelastic-
elastic transition, when instead of Eo, we vary rSR/ξ;
here we consider neutral particles (M = 1) to illustrate
that the sticking transition does not necessarily require
heavy particles. The plot of e versus rSR/ξ in the inset of
Fig. 2 (c), shows that, at low values of rSR/ξ, the particle
collision is inelastic with e = 0; and, as we increase rSR/ξ,
e becomes ﬁnite at a critical value rSR/ξ ≃ 6.46, and
ﬁnally attains a value close to 1.

Given the resolution of our study, our data are con-
sistent with a continuous sticking transition at which
e goes to zero continuously as a power β of the con-
trol parameter (either Eo or rSR/ξ). We now give a
mean-ﬁeld calculation of this power-law exponent β. The
symmetry of these head-on collisions allows us to write
uI ≃ −u1,I ≃ u2,I and uF ≃ u1,F ≃ −u2,F. The energy
balance between the states, before and after the collision,
is Erad(uI ) + mou2
I , where Erad is the energy ra-
diated into sound waves. Therefore,

F = mou2

e(uI) =q1 − Erad(uI )/mou2

I ,

(9)

I at which e(uc

which yields the critical velocity uc
I ) ﬁrst
becomes nonzero. In a simple, mean-ﬁeld approximation,
the Taylor expansion of Erad(uI), around uI = uc
I , yields
the mean-ﬁeld (MF) exponent βMF = 1/2. Our DNSs
yield values of β that are comparable to, but diﬀerent
from, βMF = 1/2. The calculation of β for this sticking
transition, beyond our mean-ﬁeld theory, and its univer-
sality, if any, is a challenging problem.

In Fig. 3 (a) we show the trajectories of two heavy par-
ticles (M = 7.5 and rSR = 1.5 ξ) that collide with each
other, with an impact parameter b > 0. If the incident
kinetic energy of the particles is suﬃciently high, e.g.,
Eo ≃ 8.7 × 10−4, they do not stick; the particles get de-
ﬂected from their incident trajectory at an angle Θ, which
depends on b (see Fig. 3 (a) for b = 2 ξ and b = 4 ξ). How-
ever, for b = 2 ξ with Eo ≃ 9.0×10−6, the incident kinetic
energy is small enough to allow the formation of a bound
pair (red curves in Fig. 3 (a)); the inset shows an enlarged
version of the particle trajectories, after the collision,
with red solid (dashed) curves for particle O1 (O2). The
sun-ﬂower-petal pattern of these trajectories indicates
that, after transients have decayed, the damped, oscilla-
tory motion of the particles in the bound-pair is akin to
that of a dimer, with vibrational and rotational degrees of
freedom. The power-spectra of the time series qi,j(t), for
particle i ∈ {1, 2} and coordinate j ∈ {x, y}, show three
prominent frequencies, ωa = 0.0185c/ξ, ωb = 0.0148c/ξ,
and ωc = 0.0222c/ξ, with 2ωa = ωb + ωc, i.e., the oscilla-
tory motion is quasiperiodic (data not shown).

If we start with more than two particles, then a suc-

cession of inelastic collisions can lead to the formation of
multi-particle aggregates. We illustrate this in Fig. 3(b)
for an assembly of 9 particles (M = 7.5 and rSR = 1.5 ξ);
to initialize the system, we place the particles on a lattice
(inset (i)) and set them into motion by applying constant-
in-time forces, with random magnitudes and directions,
for a given duration, such that the collisions occur only
after the forces are switched oﬀ at t = t0. In Fig. 3(b)
we plot EF(t) − EF(t0), E0, and ESR versus ct/ξ; large
spikes in these plots occur at collisions; subsequent rear-
rangements into clusters give rise to strong ﬂuctuations
in ESR; as the clusters settle into their optimal conﬁgu-
rations, the ﬂuctuations in ESR decrease until they satu-
rate towards the end of our DNS. The pseudocolor plots
of ρ(r) in the insets (ii)-(iv) of Fig. 3(b) show the ag-
gregation of particles and the formation of a 7-particle
cluster and a dimer (see the spatiotemporal evolution in
Video M5 in the Supplemental Material [16]); a much
longer DNS should lead to a 9-particle cluster here.

In conclusion, our minimal model of active and inter-
acting particles in the Gross-Pitaevskii superﬂuid yields
qualitatively new results, like the sticking transition and
rich aggregation dynamics of particle assemblies. Our
qualitative results should hold even in superﬂuids like
Helium, in BECs [19], and in three dimensions. Particles
in superﬂuids have been considered by using Biot-Savart
methods [13, 20–22], a two-ﬂuid model [23]; the GPE has
been studied with a single spherical particle [11], how-
ever, these studies have not considered the collisions and
aggregation we elucidate. Impurities in BECs [24] have
been described in terms of generalized Bose-Hubbard
Models [7], but these works do not study the problems
we consider. We hope our work will lead to experimental
studies of particle collisions and aggregation in superﬂu-
ids and BECs.

[17] We prepare such a state by specifying the locations of the
particle qi in Eq. (2), with t replaced by −it, and inte-
grate it to obtain the ground state. This procedure yields
states whose initial temporal evolution, in the GPE, pro-
duces minimal sound emission [25, 26].

CONSERVED QUANTITIES

We treat the superﬂuid and particles together as a sin-
gle system, in which we use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation
(GPE) to obtain the spatiotemporal evolution of the con-
densate wave function ψ(r, t):

VP (r− qi)ψ; (1)

here g is the eﬀective interaction strength, m the mass
of the bosons, µ the chemical potential, VP the poten-
tial that we use to represent the particles, and N0 the
total number of particles with mass mo. The equation of
motion for the particle i is

mo ¨qi = fo,i + fSR,i + Fext,i,

where

fo,i =ZA |ψ|2∇VP dr;

(2)

(3)

fSR,i arises from the short-range (SR) repulsive poten-
tial, Fext,i is the external force acting on the ith particle,
qi the particle position vector (the overhead dot repre-
sents diﬀerentiation with respect to time) and A is the
simulation domain.
In the absence of any external applied force, the total
energy E of this system is conserved. We write the total
energy of the system as

E = EF + Eo + ESR;

(4)

here EF is the energy contained in the superﬂuid ﬁeld,
Eo the total kinetic energy of the particles, and ESR the
energy from the SR repulsion between the particles; these
energies are deﬁned, respectively, as follows:

PSEUDOSPECTRAL METHOD AND

TIME-STEPPING

We use a Fourier pseudospectral method to solve the
GPE numerically. Thus the ﬁelds in spectral space are
obtained through a discrete Fourier transform with a ﬁ-
nite number of modes. We introduce the Galerkin pro-
jector PG

PG[ ˆψ(k)] = θ(kmax − k) ˆψ(k),

(8)

where ˆψ is the spatial Fourier transform of ψ, kmax is a
suitably chosen ultra-violet cut-oﬀ, and θ(·) the Heavi-
side function. To ensure global momentum conservation
we use the 2/3-dealiasing rule, with kmax = 2/3 × Nc/2,
where Nc is the number of collocation points [27]. This
conservation of momentum is essential for the study
of the collision between particles. Thus, the Galerkin-
truncated GPE (henceforth TGPE) is

2m∇2 + gPG[|ψ|2]

(9)

In our Galerkin-truncation scheme, we can write Eq. (3)
as

fo,i = −ZA(cid:20)ψ∗PG[VP (r − qi)∇ψ]
+ ψPG[VP (r − qi)∇ψ∗](cid:21)d2x.

(10)

To perform a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the
TGP Eq. (9), together with Eq. (2) that is coupled with
it, we have developed a parallel, MPI code in which we
discretize ψ(r, t) on a square, periodic simulation domain
of side L = 2π with N 2
c = 1282 collocation points. We
evaluate the linear terms in Eq. (9) in Fourier space and
the nonlinear term in physical space; we use the FFTW
library [28] for the Fourier-transform operations, and a
fourth-order, Runge-Kutta scheme, with time step ∆t, to
evolve equations Eqs. (2) and (9) in time.

For an assembly of 9 particles (for a full discussion see
the Main text), the energy and momentum are conserved
upto 2×10−5 and 2×10−7 percent, respectively; our DNS
uses 5 × 106 steps with ∆t = 2 × 10−4, and Nc = 128.
