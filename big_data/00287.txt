Abstract

Recent data collected by ATLAS and CMS at 13 TeV collision energy of the LHC indicate the

existence of a new resonant state φ with a mass of 750 GeV decaying into two photons γγ. The

properties of φ should be studied further at the LHC and also future colliders. Since only φ → γγ
decay channel has been measured, one of the best ways to extract more information about φ is

to use a γγ collider to produce φ at the resonant energy. In this work we show how γγ collider

help to verify the existence of φ and to provide some of the most important information about the
properties of φ such as branching fractions of φ → V1V2. Here Vi can be γ, Z, or W ±. We also
show that by studying angular distributions of the ﬁnal γ’s in γγ → φ → γγ, one can determine
whether this state is a spin-0 or a spin-2 state.

Introduction

Recent data collected by ATLAS and CMS at √s = 13 TeV collision energy of the LHC
indicate the existence of a new resonant state φ with a mass of 750 GeV decaying into two
photons[1]. The production cross section σ(pp → φ → γγ) is about 6 fb with the ATLAS
data hinting that φ has a broad width about 45 GeV with a local signiﬁcance of 3.9σ,

while CMS data favor a narrow width of order 100 MeV with a local signiﬁcance of 2.6σ[1].
Combining ATLAS and CMS data, one obtains: σ(pp → φ → γγ) = (6 ± 2) fb at 13 TeV.
With the assumption that φ also predominantly decays into two jets induced by gluon fusion,
gg → φ, one can extract a lower bound for Γ(φ → γγ) to be about 1 MeV. If one takes the
total width to be 45 GeV indicated by ATLAS, the branching ratio is about 10−4. More data

are needed to conﬁrm the existence of this new state. The LHC will continue to run and

will soon have more to tell about the properties of φ. At future colliders, more aspects of

this resonant state can be studied. At present, only limited information about φ is available,

namely φ is produced at pp collision and it decays into γγ ﬁnal state. Regarding γγ decay

from a state, the situation in similar to that of the 125 GeV Higgs boson discovered at the

LHC. Therefore some of the strategies at future collider for the study of φ can be employed

except that the energy has to be increased. In particular we note that a γγ collider may be

an ideal place to study some of the most important properties of the possible new resonant

state φ similar to the study of Higgs boson properties[2].

The possibility of the existence of the new resonant state φ has generated a lot of the-

oretical speculations.

If exist, φ must come from beyond the standard model (SM). We

will concentrate on how a γγ collider can provide information about the properties of the

750 GeV resonant state. The resonant state φ can be produced through γγ collision. The

problem of course is that whether it has a large luminosity to generate enough events to

study the properties of φ. We conﬁrm previous studies[3, 4] that a γγ collider constructed

by using the laser backscattering technique on the electron and positron beams in an e+e−

collider with center of mass (CM) frame energy of around 1 TeV and integrated luminosity

of order one thousand fb−1, many properties of φ can be studied. In particular some of the
expected decay modes φ → V1V2 with Vi = γ, Z, W can be studied cleanly.

Since φ can decay into two on-shell photons, according to Landau-Yang theorem, the

state cannot be a spin-1 state[5]. The two likely possibilities with low spins are spin-0 and

spin-2. Further studies are needed to know the spin property of φ[6, 7]. We show that

2

by studying angular distribution of the ﬁnal γγ through on-shell production of φ and its

subsequent decays into a γγ pair, one can easily determine whether φ is a spin-0 or spin-2

state. The work presented closely follow previous study of Higgs boson at a γγ collider by

one of us (He)[2].

γγ → φ and φ → X, γγ, and V1V2

Assuming that φ is a spin-0 scalar state, the φ → γγ decay amplitude M(J = 0, γγ) has

the form: M(0, γγ) = A(k2µk1ν − gµνk1 · k2)εµ∗(k1)εν∗(k2), which gives the decay width

Γ0,γγ = A2m3

If φ is a spin-0 pseudoscalar state, the decay amplitude has the form: M(0, γγ) =

2 . The expression for Γ0,γγ has the same form as in eq. (1).

The cross section σ(s)0,X for producing an on-shell φ at a monochromatic γγ collider
followed by φ decays into a ﬁnal state X, γγ → φ → X with a center of mass (CM) frame
energy √s is directly related to the decay width Γ0,γγ [8]. For φ be a scalar (also for a
pseudoscalar), we have

where Br0,X is the branching ratio of φ decays into the ﬁnal state X.

A γγ collider can be constructed by using the laser backscattering technique on the

electron and positron beams in an e+e− collider. For example the e+e− ILC collider. Such

a collider has been shown to be useful to study beyond SM physics [2, 9]. In this case the

energy Eγ of the photons are not monochromatic, but have a distribution f (x = Eγ/Ee)
for a given electron/positron energy Ee [10]. In the e+e− CM frame, cross section σL
γ(x1)γ(x2) → Φ → X is given by

For unpolarized laser, and unpolarized electron/positron beams, λl = λe = 0, λ(x) is also

(8)

The function I(y) plays a crucial role in gauging at what energy the production of φ will

be maximized. We plot I(y) for both polarized and unpolarized photon beams, in Figure
1. We see that for unpolarized case, I(y) peaks at about 0.4 for around y ∼ 0.6. For the
polarized case the peak value for I(y) can be enhanced by suitable choice of the laser and
electron and positron polarizations. For example with λe = 1 and λl = −1, the peak value
of I(y) can reach 1.8 for y ∼ 0.6. The enhanced peak value is at the cost of polarization of
the beams. On the other hand, unpolarized case may be easier to achieve in practice.

In Figure 2, we plot the cross section σL

0 for γγ → φ at a e+e− linear collider as a function
of √s using Γ0,γγ = 1 MeV. We conﬁrm the results obtained in Ref.[3]. We see that with
√s = 1 TeV, we see that an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb−1 will produced more than
3 × 104 and 105 φ for unpolarized and polarized cases, respectively. As long as Br0,X is no
smaller than 10−4, φ → X may be studied by a unpolarized γγ collider. Depending on the
eﬃciency of identifying the ﬁnal γ’s, the φ → γγ may be conﬁrmed at a γγ collider. For
the case of a polarized beams, the enhanced production cross section allows one to study

properties of φ to good precisions.

In principle, there should be other possible decay modes other than φ → γγ, although
at present only φ → γγ has been observed. One can easily measure the relative branching
ratios for other decay modes, because[2]

An immediate interesting measure is to decide whether gg → φ is the main production
mechanism for φ at the LHC. Approximating Γ(φ → 2jets) ≈ Γ(φ → gg), Γ0,gg can be easily
determined[3, 4].

Assuming φ is a SM singlet, the interaction inducing φ → γγ should respect the SM

gauge symmetry and can be parameterized as

L = φ(˜aBµνBµν + ˜bWµνW µν) ,

(10)

where Bµν and Wµν are the U(1)Y and SU(2)L gauge ﬁeld strength respectively.
If φ is
a pseudoscalar, one replaces BµνBµν and WµνW µν in the above by ˜BµνBµν and ˜WµνW µν,
respectively. Here ˜Xµν = (1/2)ǫµναβX αβ.

The above Lagrangian will not only induce φ → γγ, but,

in general, also φ →
γZ, ZZ, W +W −. None of the later three decays have been observed experimentally. Using
eq.(9), one can study the decay widths for φ → γZ, ZZ, W +W − at a γγ collider[3]. We now
look at this in a slight diﬀerent way than that carried out in Ref.[3]. For convenience, we
normalize ˜a(˜b) = (4πΓ/m3

φ)1/2a(b). We have

Γ0,γγ = Γ(ac2

W + bs2

W )2 ,

(11)

where cW = cos θW and sW = sinθW .

Taking Γ = Γ0,γγ, implies that (ac2

In Figure 3, we show Ri as functions of b. Note that one cannot simultaneously make all

Ri to be zero. At least two of them will show up at some level. The worst scenario is that b is

about 0.3 where all three Ri are below 0.25. This may be the reason that these decay modes

have not been observed at the LHC run II. If this is indeed the case, these decay modes may

be diﬃcult to be studied at a unpolarized γγ collider for Γ0,γγ taking its present lower bound.

But for the polarized case, it is still possible. Once one of the Ri is measured, the other two

will be predicted. One should be aware that at the LHC, the production mechanism may
not be due to gg → φ. Photo-production may also be possible[7, 11]. In that case Γ0,γγ
can be much larger than 1 MeV. A γγ collider with unpolarized photon beams can also

study the decay modes to good precision. We conclude that it is possible to verify the exis-

tence of φ at a γγ at a CM frame energy of 1 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb−1.

Angular distribution of γ and spin of φ

Since the LHC has observed φ → γγ, φ cannot be a spin-1 particle due to Landau-Yang
theorem [5]. The other possible low spin states 0 and 2 are not ruled out. The consequences

should be studied[6]. A γγ collider can provide detailed information about the spin of φ by

studying the angular distribution of the ﬁnal photons.

For a scalar or a pseudoscalar φ, the angular distribution for one of the ﬁnal photon

respecting to the incoming γ beams shown in Fig. 3 is isotropic in the γγ CM frame [2, 12]

(13)

In the e+e− CM frame (laboratory frame), collision of the two photons is not in the γγ

CM frame and therefore the distribution of the photons is not the same as that predicted

by eq. (13). In the laboratory frame, depending on the values of x1 and x2, the two photons

may have diﬀerent energy. The φ produced will be boosted to the direction of the photon

with a larger xi. The angle θ when seeing from laboratory frame will be changed to θL. The

relation between θ and θL can be written as the following

The laboratory frame angular distribution A(0, θL) of θL for a spin-0 scalar can be studied

One can also deﬁned a similar quantity for the case of φ being a particle with a diﬀerent

spin, spin-J, A(J, θL). We ﬁnd that this quantity can give information about the spin of the

φ resonant state. To see how this works, we take an example of a spin-2 tensor coupled to

γγ, in a similar fashion as a scalar couples to two gravitons, to study A(2, θL) and compared
with A(0, θL) for a spin-0 scalar. In this case the matrix element for φ → γγ can be written
as [13]

M(2, γγ) = −κ

(17)

Note that in the γγ CM frame, the ﬁnal γ has a non-trivial angular distribution for spin-2

tensor. This also shows up in the laboratory frame. We ﬁnd that if comparing A(0, θL) and

In Fig.

A(2, θL), one can distinguish diﬀerent cases even without knowing Γi,γγ and Bi,γγ separately.
4, we plot A(0, θL) and A(2, θL) for several diﬀerent √s. We see that at
√s = 1 TeV, the diﬀerence for spin-0 and spin-2 laboratory frame angular distribution are
substantial and can easily distinguish these two cases.

Summary

To summarize, we have studied how a γγ collider can help to provide some of the most

important information about the φ resonant state hinted by LHC run II data. We have shown

that a γγ collider can verify whether φ indeed exists, and probe some of important properties
of it. Diﬀerent models can be tested by studying φ → γZ, φ → ZZ and φ → W +W −.
Studying angular distribution of the γγ through on-shell production of φ and its subsequent

decays into a γγ pair can decide whether the φ is a spin-0 or a spin-2 state.
