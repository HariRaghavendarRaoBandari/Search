We show, by direct numerical simulations, that heavy inertial particles (with Stokes number St)
in inhomogeneously forced statistically stationary turbulent ﬂows cluster at the minima of turbulent
kinetic energy. We further show that two turbulent transport processes, turbophoresis and turbulent
diﬀusion together determine the spatial distribution of the particles. The ratio of the corresponding
transport coeﬃcient – the turbulent Soret coeﬃcient – increases with St for small St, reaches a
maxima for St ≈ 10 and decreases as ∼ St−0.33 for large St.

INTRODUCTION

The subject of this paper is turbulent ﬂows of New-
tonian ﬂuids with small particles. We limit ourselves to
spherical particles whose radii are signiﬁcantly smaller
than the viscous scale of the ﬂuid. We further assume
that the material density of each particle is signiﬁcantly
larger than that of the ﬂuid and the number density of
the particles is quite low. In this parameter regime the
equations of motion of each individual particle are well
described by

˙X = V
1
˙V =
τ

{u[X(t), t] − V } ,

(1)

where X and V are respectively the position and veloc-
ity of the particle, τ is the characteristic relaxation time
of the particle and u is the ﬂow velocity. As the number
density of the particles is assumed to be small, the eﬀects
of the particles on the ﬂow and particle-particle interac-
tions are both ignored. The ﬂow velocity u is obtained by
solving the Navier–Stokes equation with proper bound-
ary conditions. Particles that satisfy (1) are called Heavy
Inertial Particles (HIP). This approximation is often used
to model various natural and industrial ﬂows. Two im-
portant examples are: (a) droplets in warm clouds [see,
e.g., 1, 2, for a review] and (b) dust grains in astrophys-
ical accretion disks [see, e.g., 3, for a review].

The study of heavy inertial particles in homogeneous
and isotropic turbulent (HIT) ﬂows is a topic of current
interest. In addition to the ﬂuid Reynolds number, such a
problem is described by a second dimensionless number,
the Stokes number, deﬁned by St ≡ τ /τf , where τf is a
characteristic time scale of the ﬂow. Recent analytical,
numerical, and experimental works have shown that HIPs
self-organize in fractal clusters in HIT, [see, e.g., 4, 5, and
references therein] and at small distances the probability
distribution function (PDF) of their relative velocities
show power-law behavior [6, 7].

The focus of this paper is the large-scale clustering
of heavy inertial particles in inhomogeneous turbulence.
Numerical and experimental studies in wall-bounded
ﬂows, e.g., channel and pipe ﬂows, have shown that
heavy inertial particles distribute themselves preferen-
tially near the wall – a phenomenon that has been called
turbophoresis by analogy with thermophoresis. Ther-
mophoresis – motion of molecules governed by gradient
in temperature [8] – is well understood within the frame-
work of local thermodynamic equilibrium in statistical
mechanics [9]. Recent works [10, 11] have demonstrated
that the ﬂux of molecules in thermophoresis can be well
described by

(cid:104)J (cid:105)th = −D∇(cid:104)N(cid:105)th − DT(cid:104)N(cid:105)th∇T

(2)
where D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, N the concentration
of the molecules, DT the thermophoretic coeﬃcient, and
the symbol (cid:104)·(cid:105)th denotes averaging over a state in local
thermal equilibrium at temperature T . The ratio of the
thermophoretic coeﬃcient to the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is
called the Soret coeﬃcient [12]. In this paper we show by
direct numerical simulations (DNS) that the large-scale
clustering of heavy inertial particles in inhomogeneous
turbulence can be described by a similar expression:

(cid:104)J(cid:105)turb = −κ∇(cid:104)N(cid:105)turb − κt(cid:104)N(cid:105)turb∇K.

(3)

Here J is the ﬂux of particles, κ is the turbulent diﬀusiv-
ity, κt the turbophoretic coeﬃcient, N the number density
of the inertial particles, the symbol (cid:104)·(cid:105)turb denotes averag-
ing over the non-equilibrium statistically stationary state
of turbulence, K ≡ (cid:104)ρu2(cid:105)turb is called the turbulent ki-
netic energy and ρ is the density of the ﬂuid. We also cal-
culate the turbulent Soret coeﬃcient Sot ≡ κt/κ and ﬁnd
√K where
that our data are well described by Sot = σt/
σt is a non-monotonic function of the Stokes number –
σt increases with St for small St, reaches a maximum
value around St ≈ 10 and decreases with St for large St.

Although qualitative similarities between thermophore-
sis and turbophoresis has been pointed out before, this
is the ﬁrst calculation of the turbulent Soret coeﬃcient
and its dependence on the Stokes number.

MODEL

So far, most numerical [13–16] and experimental [17]
observations of large-scale clustering and deposition [18,
19] of HIP in inhomogeneous ﬂows are in wall-bounded
ﬂows. In such ﬂows it has not been possible to disentan-
gle the individual eﬀects of inhomogeneities of turbulent
kinetic energy, large-scale shear, and physical boundaries.
For a deeper understanding of turbophoresis, we choose
to do DNS of the Navier–Stokes equation

Dtρ + ρ∂kuk = 0,

ρDtuj = −∂jp + µ∂kSkj + fjF (z),

(4)

(5)

where ∂k denotes partial derivatives with respect to co-
ordinate k, Dt ≡ ∂t + uk∂k is the advective derivative, u
(whose k-th component is uk), p, and ρ are respectively
the velocity, pressure, and density of the ﬂow, µ is the
dynamic viscosity, and Skj ≡ ∂kuj + ∂juk − δjk(2/3)∂kuk
is the viscous stress. The simulations are performed in
a three-dimensional periodic box with sides Lx = Ly =
Lz = 2π. In addition we use the ideal gas equation of
state with a constant speed of sound cs = 1.

The ﬂow attains a statistically stationary state where
the average energy dissipation by viscous forces is bal-
lanced by the average energy injection by the external
force f which is random, Gaussian, white-in-time, con-
centrated on a shell of wavenumbers with radius kf
in
Fourier space [20]. The amplitude of the external force is
chosen such that the Mach number is always less that 0.1,
i.e., the ﬂow is weakly compressible. Crucially, the ﬂow
is made inhomogeneous (but isotropic) by the function
F (z) which is a function of one coordinate direction, z.
We choose the function F (z) to be a slowly varying func-
tion of z, i.e., the characteristic wavenumber of F (z),
qF (cid:28) kf .
In particular, we examine three cases: (A)
F (z) = sin2(z), (B) F (z) = exp[−(z/H)2] with H = 1,
and (C) F (z) = sin2(2z). In the context of the present
problem, length scales large than 1/kf are the large scales
.

We use the pencil-code [21], which uses a sixth-
order ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme for space derivatives and
a third-order Williamson-Runge-Kutta [22] scheme for
time derivatives. The same setup, with a homogeneous
external force, has been used in studies of scaling and
intermittency in ﬂuid and magnetohydrodynamic tur-
bulence [23–25]. We deﬁne the Reynolds number by
Re ≡ urms/(νkf ), where urms is the root-mean-square
velocity of the ﬂow averaged over the whole domain and
the kinematic viscosity ν = µ/ρ. As we are interested
in large-scale clustering, we use τf ≡ 1/(urmskf ), which

2

is the characteristic time scale of the ﬂow at scale 1/kf ,
to deﬁne the Stokes number. In our simulations we use
three diﬀerent value of Lxkf /2π = 5, 15, and 30. Here
we interpret the averaging (cid:104)·(cid:105)turb as Reynolds averaging
which we implement by averaging over the x and y coor-
dinate directions.

RESULTS

In ﬁg (1) we plot the turbulent kinetic energy K(z) ≡
(cid:104)ρu2(cid:105)x,y and the mean number density of the particles
n(z) ≡ (cid:104)N(cid:105)x,y for the three diﬀerent F (z) and for diﬀer-
ent values of the Stokes number. Here the symbol (cid:104)·(cid:105)x,y
denotes averaging over coordinate directions x and y and
the number density of the particles N (x) ≡ δ3(x − X).
where δ3(·) is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function.
Clearly, the particles cluster away from the maxima of K,
i.e., turbophoresis is observed.
We now want to quantify turbophoresis using (3). At
stationary state, the mean ﬂux, (cid:104)J(cid:105)x,y, must be zero
(here we neglected the molecular ﬂux). Furthermore, as
the turbulence is inhomogeneous in only one direction, z,
(3) reduces to the following one dimensional problem:

dn

= 0.

(6)

Clearly, it is impossible to measure the turbulent trans-
port coeﬃcients κt and κ individually. Instead, only their
ratio, which we call the turbulent Soret coeﬃcient, Sot,
can be measured. In addition, to integrate (6) and com-
pare with our data we need to make conjectures about
the spatial dependence of Sot. The naive one would be to
assume that Sot does not depend on space; which would
imply

n = n0 exp(−SotK).

(7)

In the top panel of ﬁg (2) we show that this conjec-
ture does not ﬁt our data well even in the best of cases.
Let us note now, that although we do not know what
κ would be in inhomogeneous turbulence, the turbulent
diﬀusion has been a well studied problem in homoge-
tains κ ∼ urms/kf , with urms ≡ √K.

we conjecture that κ(z) ∼ (cid:112)K(z), i.e., Sot ≡ σt/
In the present
problem K is a slowly varying function of space, hence

With this substitution, (6) can be integrated to obtain

ﬁg (2). If κ ∼ √K/kf were true even in inhomogeneous
two diﬀerent cases in the middle and the bottom panel of
turbulence we would have obtained σt ∼ κtkf , i.e., the
coeﬃcient σt is proportional to the turbophoretic coeﬃ-
cient κt.

middle panel of ﬁg (1).

We calculate σt for a range of values of St for three
diﬀerent spatial distributions of the turbulent kinetic en-
ergy, three diﬀerent values of Lxkf /2π, two diﬀerent res-
olutions (2563 and 5123) and for several values of the
Reynolds number ranging from 12 to 56. The results are
plotted in ﬁg (3). For very small and very large values of
St our results are not very precise because the large-scale
clustering is weak for both of these limits. These data
points are marked in ﬁg (3) with a dashed box around
them. For moderate values of St we ﬁnd that σt increases
with St roughly as St2/3. At around St ≈ 10 this trend
reverses and σt decreases with St, in other words the clus-
tering phenomenon becomes weaker. For higher values of
St we ﬁnd that σt decreases approximately as St−1/3.

To summarize, two results lie at the heart of our pa-

per: (a) we quantify large-scale clustering in inhomoge-
neous turbulent ﬂows through turbulent Soret coeﬃcient
and (b) we ﬁnd non-monotonic behavior of the turbu-
lent Soret coeﬃcient as a function of Stokes number with
maximum clustering appearing at St ≈ 10.

DISCUSSIONS

Large-scale clustering of inertial particles in inhomo-
geneous turbulent ﬂows is commonly observed in geo-
physical and engineering problems. But in trying to un-
derstand such clustering we encounter a diﬃcult prob-

4

be seen from ﬁg (3). We believe this is because we have
not been able to access small enough St.

An alternative way to analytically understand turbu-
lent Soret eﬀect would be to replace the ﬂuid velocity, u,
in Equation (1) by a Gaussian white noise whose strength
is the function F (z) of one coordinate, z. Treating Equa-
tion (1) as a Langevin problem it is then possible to
write the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation which
is an equation for the probability distribution function
p(z, v). The particle number density can be obtained

by N (z) =(cid:82) p(z, v)dv. For a general F (z) a stationary

solution of this Fokker–Planck equation is not known.
If the strength of the noise F (z) = c is taken to be a
constant, then it is possible to obtain a ﬂux-free sta-
tionary solution of the Fokker–Planck equation to obtain
p(z, v) ∼ exp(−τ v2/c2). If F (z) is assumed to be a slowly
varying function of space then using the method of multi-
ple scales it is possible to calculate a ﬂux that has both a
diﬀusive and a turbophoretic part [see the supplemental
material of 30]. But in such a model the turbulent Soret
coeﬃcient is no longer a function of St but a constant.
To capture the non-monotonic dependence of Sot on St,
as we observe, it may be necessary to use a colored noise
instead of white-in-time noise. In Ref. [31] it has been
shown that for F (z) = z2 it is possible to ﬁnd non-trivial
solution of the Fokker-Planck equation, which leads to
a localization-delocalization transition.
In other words
large-scale clustering should be observed below a critical
value of the Stokes number. This is not observed in our
numerical experiments.

In this work, we have considered an isothermal ﬂow

geophysical problems, it is common to have fully devel-
oped turbulent ﬂows with an inhomogeneous distribution
of mean temperature. In such cases, the HIPs are found
to accumulate in the vicinity of the minima of mean tem-
perature. This large-scale clustering phenomenon, which
can be described by turbulent thermal diﬀusion, was pre-
dicted in analytical study [32] and detected in laboratory
experiments [33], DNS [34] and atmospheric observations
[35].

lem due to an inhomogeneous distribution of turbulent
kinetic energy, presence of large-scale shear, anisotropy,
gravity and boundary layers. To make progress, it is es-
sential that we study each eﬀect in isolation. To this
end, in this paper, we have proposed a model in which
large-scale clustering is due solely to the inhomogeneous
distribution of kinetic energy. We ﬁnd that the minimum
of the number density of the particles appears at the max-
imum of the turbulent kinetic energy. Furthermore, we
ﬁnd that this clustering is determined by two processes;
√K with
turbulent diﬀusion and turbulent Soret eﬀect, where the
turbulent Soret coeﬃcient is given by Sot = σt/
σt increasing with St for small St reaching a peak near
St ≈ 10 and then decreasing with St. The large-scale
clustering observed in turbulent pipe ﬂows [26], which is
similar to what has been observed in turbulent channel
ﬂows in Ref. [16], can be analysed in a similar manner to
extract a turbulent Soret coeﬃcient whose dependence
on the Stokes number is similar to what has been ob-
served by us but for the data very close to the wall and
near the center of the pipe [27]. We believe that to un-
derstand such departure the eﬀects of the boundary layer
and anisotropy has to be taken into account.

A special mention must be made of Ref. [28] where the
same clustering phenomenon is studied in turbulent Kol-
mogorov ﬂows. Although the authors do not interpret
their results as a balance between turbophoretic and tur-
bulent diﬀusive ﬂuxes as we do, they do observe that
clustering increases for small St but this trend reverses
smoothly at higher values of St.

To the best of our knowledge, an analytical calculation
of the turbophoretic coeﬃcient (not the turbulent Soret
coeﬃcient) was done in Ref. [29] using the Lagrangian
History Direct Interaction Approximation to obtain a lin-
ear dependence of the turbophoretic coeﬃcient on St for
small St. Our data do not agree with these result as can
