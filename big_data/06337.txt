On time adaptive critical variable exponent

vectorial diﬀusion ﬂows and their applications in

image processing

V. B. Surya Prasath∗

D. Vorotnikov†

Abstract

Variable exponent spaces have found interesting applications in real world
problems. Recently, there have been considerable interest in utilizing varia-
tional and evolution problems based on variable exponents for imaging appli-
cations. The main classes of partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) related to
the variable exponents involve the p(·)-Laplacian. In imaging applications, the
variable exponent can approach the critical value 1, and this poses unique chal-
lenges in proving existence of solutions, which have not been mastered earlier.
In this work, we develop some additional functional framework to study the
time-dependent parabolic ﬂows with critical variable exponents. Speciﬁcally,
we consider bounded vectorial partial variation (BVPV) space and its variable
exponent counterpart. We prove the existence of weak solutions of critical
vectorial p(t, x)-Laplacian ﬂow in our variable exponent space. For non-time-
dependent variable exponent based critical vectorial p(x)-Laplacian ﬂow we
obtain a semigroup solution. The results are new even in the scalar case. This
is a theory-oriented draft, and the full paper will provide detailed experimental
results on color image restoration using various example for the variable expo-
nents and compare them traditional PDE based image processing procedures.
Our results will indicate the applicability of variable exponent Laplacian ﬂows
in image processing in general and image restoration in particular.

Fix a measurable variable exponent p : (0, T )×Ω → [1, p+]. We look for the solutions
u : (0, T ) × Ω → RN to the following Neumann problem

∂tu(t, x) = div[|∇u(t, x)|p(t,x)−2∇u(t, x)] + f (t, x, u(t, x)),
∂u
∂ν (t, x) = 0, x ∈ ∂Ω,
u(0, x) = u0(x).

(1.1)

Ω ⊂ Rn is the bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary, RN is the codomain of




vector-valued functions u(t, x).

Q = (0, T ) × Ω
Qt = (0, t) × Ω
M = RN ×n
For a vector function u(t, x) ∈ RN , we write ∇u(t, x) ∈ M for its Jacobi matrix.
For a matrix function A = Aij(t, x) ∈ M, the divergence operator acts as (div A)i =
n

∂Aij
∂xj

.

Pj=1

The Frobenius norm of a matrix A ∈ M is denoted by |A| =pT r(A⊤A).

The scalar product of vectors from RN and the componentwise scalar product in

M is denoted by a dot.

Ω is bounded, so when we refer to Radon measures, we always mean ﬁnite Radon

measures.

The Lebesgue measure of a set is denote by | · |
(·, ·) and k · k are the scalar product and Euclidean norm in L2(Ω, RN ) or in

L2(Ω, M).

We recall [5, 8] that the subdiﬀerential of a functional Φ : H → R ∪ {+∞} is the

multivalued map

∂Φ : dom ∂Φ ⊂ H ⊸ H,

∂Φ(u) = {w ∈ H : Φ(u + h) ≥ Φ(u) + (w, h)H, ∀h ∈ H} .

(1.2)

The set dom ∂Φ consists of those u ∈ H for which the right-hand side of (1.2) is
non-empty. When Φ is diﬀerentiable, ∂Φ is single-valued and coincides with the
usual gradient gradH Φ : H → H.

2 The functional framework

2.1 Preliminaries

We give here some basic deﬁnitions of the bounded variation and variable exponent
spaces, for further details we refer to [7, 9, 12]. Let L0(Ω) be the set of measurable
scalar functions on Ω ⊂ Rn. Fix a function p ∈ L0(Ω) (the variable exponent).
Denote

p− = ess inf
Ω

p(x),

and p+ = ess sup
Ω

p(x).

For our needs it suﬃces to assume that

1 ≤ p− ≤ p+ < +∞.

Consider the modular ρ(u) =RΩ |u(x)|p(x) dx. Then

Lp(·)(Ω) := {u ∈ L0(Ω)|∃λ > 0 : ρ(u/λ) < +∞}.

The Luxemburg-Nakano norm on Lp(·) is kukLp(·) := inf{λ > 0 : ρ(u/λ) ≤ 1}. We
recall that

Lp+(Ω) ⊂ Lp(·)(Ω) ⊂ Lp−(Ω),

(2.1)

and the embeddings are continuous.

The Orlicz-Sobolev space is

W 1,p(·)(Ω) := {u ∈ Lp(·)(Ω) : ∇u ∈ Lp(·)(Ω)n}

with kukW 1,p(·) := kukLp(·) + k|∇u|kLp(·). Then

W 1,p+(Ω) ⊂ W 1,p(·)(Ω) ⊂ W 1,p−(Ω),

(2.2)

and the embeddings are continuous.

The bounded variation space is deﬁned as follows: a function u ∈ BV (Ω) if

u ∈ L1(Ω), and if its total variation

T V (u) := sup(cid:26)ZΩ

u div φ : φ ∈ C 1

0 (Ω)n, kφkL∞(Ω)n ≤ 1(cid:27)

is ﬁnite; the norm in BV (Ω) is given by

kukBV := kukL1 + T V (u).

3

The distributional gradient ∇u is a vector-valued Radon measure, and hence the
total variation |∇u| (in the measure-theoretic sense) of this measure is a Radon
measure. It is called the total variation measure and is sometimes also denoted by
T V (u). One can check that T V (u)(Ω) = T V (u).

In the case when p− = 1, the Orlicz-Sobolev space deﬁned above is not reﬂexive,
and it is plausible to use the space BV p(·)(Ω) deﬁned below in various applications.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A measurable function p : Ω → [1, +∞) is Y -semicontinuous pro-
vided p(x0) = 1 for any sequence xk → x0 in Ω such that p(xk) → 1.

Assume in addition that p(x) is a Y -semicontinuous function. Let

Y := {x ∈ Ω : p(x) = 1}

be the critical set where the exponent takes the value 1. It is obviously closed in the
relative topology of Ω.

We now put BV p(·)(Ω) := BV (Ω) ∩ W 1,p(·)(Ω \ Y ), and consider the nonnegative

number

T V p(·)(u) := T V (u)(Y ) +ZΩ\Y

|∇u|p(x) dx.

Then the norm in BV p(·) is

kukBV p(·)(Ω) := kukLp(·) + inf(cid:8)λ > 0 : T V p(·)(u/λ) ≤ 1(cid:9) .

All the spaces discussed above are Banach ones.

Remark 2.2. It is usually assumed that the exponent p(·) is at least lower semi-
continuous [10] in the deﬁnition of BV p(·)(Ω). However, our weaker assumption of
Y -semicontinuity is enough.
Remark 2.3. If u ∈ BV (Ω)N is a vector function, then we can set

T V (u) := sup(cid:26)ZΩ

u · div Φ : Φ ∈ C 1

0 (Ω; M), kΦkL∞(Ω;M) ≤ 1(cid:27) .

(2.3)

Moreover (see Section 2.2 for more general considerations), the components of the
distributional Jacobi matrix ∇u are signed Radon measures on Ω, and the total
variation (Radon) measure is determined by the formula

T V (u)(E) = sup(Xk

|∇u(Ek)|) ,

(2.4)

where the supremum is taken over all Borel partitions {Ek} of a Borel set E ⊂ Ω.

4

2.2 Sobolev-BVPV spaces

The standard variable exponent function spaces (which were recalled in the previ-
ous section) are suitable for stationary problems. We now develop some additional
functional framework in order to study parabolic variable exponent ﬂows.

Let M be the the continuous dual of the space C0(Q)N of continuous vector
functions on Q that vanish on the boundary of the cylinder Q. By the Riesz duality
[12, Theorem B114], it can be also viewed as the Banach space of N-vectorial signed
Radon measures on Q equipped with the total variation norm

where the Radon measure |v| is the total variation of the measure v. We recall that

kvkM = |v|(Q),

(2.5)

|v|(E) = sup(Xk

|v(Ek)|) ,

(2.6)

where the supremum is taken over all Borel partitions {Ek} of a Borel set E ⊂ Q.
For v ∈ M, we deﬁne the vectorial partial variation of v as

V P V (v) =

sup

Φ∈C1

0 (Q;M): |Φ|≤1

hv, div ΦiM×C0(Q)N .

(2.7)

Observe that if v ∈ L1(0, T ; W 1

Deﬁne the “bounded vectorial partial variation space” BV P V as

1 (Ω))N , then V P V (v) =R T
kvkBV P V := kvkM + V P V (v) < +∞o .

0 RΩ |∇v(t, x)| dx dt.

nv ∈ M(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

The following proposition is straightforward by the Riesz duality:

Proposition 2.4. For any v ∈ BV P V , the components of its distributional Jacobi
matrix ∇v are signed Radon measures on Q.

For any v ∈ BV P V and a Borel set E ⊂ Q, consider the nonnegative scalar

V P V (v)(E) = sup(Xk

|∇v(Ek)|) ,

(2.8)

where the supremum is taken over all Borel partitions {Ek} of E. Then [12, Propo-
sition B75 and Theorem B114]and Proposition 2.4 imply

5

Proposition 2.5. For any v ∈ BV P V , V P V (v) is a Radon measure on Q, and
V P V (v)(Q) = V P V (v).

For every open set U ⊂ Q and v ∈ BV P V , applying [12, Theorem B114] to the

measure ∇v U ∈ (C0(U; M))∗, we infer that

V P V (v)(U) =

sup

Φ∈C∞

0 (U ;M): |Φ|≤1

hv, div ΦiM(U )×C0(U )N .

(2.9)

Owing to lower semicontinuity of suprema, we can derive from (2.9) the following

fact:

Proposition 2.6. For any weakly-* converging (in M) sequence {vm} ⊂ BV P V ,
one has

where v = lim vm. Moreover,

V P V (v) ≤ lim inf
m→+∞

V P V (vm)

V P V (v)(U) ≤ lim inf
m→+∞

V P V (vm)(U)

(2.10)

(2.11)

for every open set U ⊂ Q.

Then (2.10) yields

Proposition 2.7. BV P V is a Banach space.

We now ﬁx a Y -semicontinuous scalar function p : Q → [p−, p+] ⊂ [1, +∞) (the

variable exponent). Note that the critical set

Y := [p(t, x) = 1]

(2.12)

is closed in the relative topology of Q.

The evolutionary Orlicz-Sobolev space W 0,1

p(·)(Q\Y )N is deﬁned as

W 0,1

p(·)(Q\Y )N := {v ∈ Lp(·)(Q\Y )N : ∇v ∈ Lp(·)(Ω; M)}.

It is easy to establish

Proposition 2.8. The space W 0,1

p(·)(Q\Y )N equipped with the norm

kvkW 0,1

p(·)(Q\Y )N := k|v|kLp(·)(Q\Y ) + k|∇v|kLp(·)(Q\Y ).

is a Banach space. It is reﬂexive provided p− > 1.

6

We deﬁne the subset BV P V p(·) of M as follows: a vectorial Radon measure v
belongs to BV P V p(·) provided V P V (v) < ∞, the restriction v
(Q\Y ) is absolutely
continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, and the Radon-Nikodym derivative

v|Q\Y :=

d(v

(Q\Y ))

dx ⊗ dt

belongs to W 0,1
but sloppy formula:

p(·)(Q\Y )N . This deﬁnition is expressed by the following descriptive

BV P V p(·) = BV P V ∩ W 0,1

p(·)(Q\Y )N .

(2.13)

Given a function v ∈ BV P V p(·), we deﬁne the nonnegative number

V P V p(·)(v) = V P V (v)(Y ) +ZQ\Y

|∇v(t, x)|p(t,x) dx dt.

(2.14)

Proposition 2.9. BV P V p(·) is a Banach space, being equipped with the norm

kvkBV P Vp(·) := |v|(Y ) + kvkLp(·)(Q\Y )N + inf(cid:8)λ > 0 : V P V p(·)(v/λ) ≤ 1(cid:9) ,

or with the equivalent norm

kvkBV P V p(·) := kvkBV P V + kvkW 0,1

p(·)(Q\Y )N .

(2.15)

(2.16)

Proof. It is clear that (2.16) is a norm on BV P V p(·). Let {vk} be a Cauchy sequence
in this norm. By Proposition 2.7, it admits a limit v in BV P V . Hence, vk
(Q\Y ) →
p(·)(Q\Y )N ,
v
which should coincide with v|Q\Y . Thus, BV P V p(·) is a Banach space.

(Q\Y ) in total variation. By Proposition 2.8, vk|Q\Y has a limit in W 0,1

Observe now that V P V p(·)(v) < +∞ for v ∈ BV P V p(·). Hence,

inf(cid:8)λ > 0 : V P V p(·)(v/λ)(cid:9) < +∞

for all v ∈ BV P V p(·). Furthermore, inf(cid:8)λ > 0 : V P V p(·)(v/λ)(cid:9) is a seminorm on

BV P V p(·) by an argument similar to the proof of [7, Theorem 2.1.7]. Consequently,
(2.15) is a norm on BV P V p(·).

It remains to conclude that both norms are equivalent since, due to (2.1),

kvkBV P Vp(·) → 0

|vk(t, x)|p(t,x) + |∇vk(t, x)|p(t,x) dx dt → 0

⇐⇒ |vk|(Y ) + V P V (vk)(Y ) +ZQ\Y
⇐⇒ |vk|(Q) + V P V (vk) +ZQ\Y

|vk(t, x)|p(t,x) + |∇vk(t, x)|p(t,x) dx dt → 0

⇐⇒ kvkBV P V p(·) → 0.

(2.17)

7

Remark 2.10. The space BV P V p(·) is relevant for image processing applications since
it allows for jumps on the critical set Y even if this critical set is merely a null set in
Q (e.g., a hypersurface in Q).

For any function v ∈ BV P V p(·), we deﬁne the measure V P V p(·)(v) on Q by

letting

V P V p(·)(v) = V P V (v) Y + |∇v(t, x)|p(t,x) dx dt

(Q \ Y ).

(2.18)

The following observation is clear in view of (2.14):

Proposition 2.11. For any v ∈ BV P V p(·), V P V p(·)(v) is a Radon measure on Q,
and V P V (v)p(·)(Q) = V P V p(·)(v).

The following lower-semicontinuity property of V P V p(·) is crucial in the applica-

tions.

Theorem 2.12. For any open set U ⊂ Q, and for any weakly-* converging (in M)
sequence {vm} ⊂ BV P V p(·), v = lim vm, one has

V P V p(·)(v)(U) ≤ lim inf
m→+∞

V P V p(·)(vm)(U).

(2.19)

In particular, if U = Q and the limit inferior is ﬁnite, then v ∈ BV P V p(·).

Proof. Assume that U = Q. Mutatis mutandis, the same argument works for U 6= Q.
Let the limit inferior in (2.19) be ﬁnite (otherwise the theorem holds trivially).

By Proposition 2.6, v ∈ BV P V .

For any ǫ > 0, consider the sets

Yǫ :=(cid:26)s0 ∈ Q,

inf

s∈∂Q∪Y

|s0 − s| ≤ ǫ(cid:27) ,

which are closed in the relative topology of Q. Let Uǫ := ˚Yǫ.

Then

|∂Yǫ| = |∂Uǫ| = 0

(at least up to a countable set of ǫ’s), and

Moreover, ∩ǫ>0(Yǫ\Y ) = ∅, whence

The spaces W 0,1

to a subsequence if necessary,

and (2.19) follows due to (2.23) and (2.24).

3 The critical vectorial p(t, x)-Laplacian ﬂow

Fix a Y -semicontinuous variable exponent p : Q → [1, p+] with Y = [p(t, x) = 1]
being the critical set in Q. We are interested in deﬁning and studying the solutions
u : Q → RN , Z ∈ Q → M to the following Neumann problem

∂tu(t, x) = div Z(t, x) + f (t, x, u(t, x)),
Z(t, x) = |∇u(t, x)|p(t,x)−2∇u(t, x),
Z(t, x)ν(x) = 0, x ∈ ∂Ω,
u(0, x) = u0(x).

Observation 3.2. Let us present a motivation for this deﬁnition of solution to (3.1).
Further motivation is discussed in Observation 3.11 below.

Consider a pair (u, Z) of suﬃciently regular functions satisfying (3.3),(3.4), (3.5),

(3.6). Then we can rewrite (3.5) in the form

Letting U = Uǫ, ǫ → 0, we get

(Z − |∇w(t, x)|p(t,x)−2∇w(t, x)) · (∇u(t, x) − ∇w(t, x)) dx dt ≥ 0.

(3.16)

ZQ\Y

By a Minty argument, this yields

Z = |∇u|p(·)−2∇u

Integrating be parts in (3.4), we infer

(∂tu − div Z − f (·, u), v) +Z∂Ω

v · Zν dHn−1 = 0.

(3.18)

Testing (3.18) by any smooth v compactly supported in Ω, we deduce the ﬁrst equa-
tion in (3.1). Consequently, both integrals in (3.18) are identically zero. By arbi-
trariness of v, Zν = 0 Hn−1-a.e. in ∂Ω.

Theorem 3.3. If u0 ∈ L2(Ω)N , ˜f ∈ L2(Q), and the function v 7→ v · f (t, x, v) is
concave for a.a. (t, x) ∈ Q. Then there exists a weak solution to (3.1).

3.2 Disgression: on solvability of some nonlinear Cauchy

problems in Hilbert triples

Assume that there are two Hilbert spaces, X ⊂ Y, with continuous embedding op-
erator i : X → Y , and i(X) is dense in Y . The adjoint operator i∗ : Y ∗ → X ∗ is
continuous and, since i(X) is dense in Y , one-to-one. Since i is one-to-one, i∗(Y ∗)
is dense in X ∗, and one may identify Y ∗ with a dense subspace of X ∗. Due to the
Riesz representation theorem, one may also identify Y with Y ∗. We arrive at the
chain of inclusions:

X ⊂ Y ≡ Y ∗ ⊂ X ∗.

(3.19)

Both embeddings here are dense and continuous. Observe that in this situation, for
f ∈ Y, u ∈ X, their scalar product in Y coincides with the value of the functional f
from X ∗ on the element u ∈ X:

(f, u)Y = hf, ui.

(3.20)

Such triples (X, Y, X ∗) are called Hilbert triples (sometimes also referred to as Gelfand
or Lions triples), see, e.g., [18, 20] for more details.

Lemma 3.4. Let

X ⊂ Y ⊂ X ∗

be a Hilbert triple. Let A : X → X ∗ be a linear continuous operator such that

hAu, ui ≥ αkuk2
X

for all u ∈ X and some common α > 0. Let V be a Banach space such that

X ⊂ V ⊂ Y

where the ﬁrst embedding is compact and the second is continuous. Assume that both
X and V are separable. Assume moreover that

kukV ≤ kukθ

Xkuk1−θ

(3.21)

for some θ ∈ (0, 1). Let

QL, QM : (0, T ) × V → X ∗

be Carath´eodory functions, i.e., QL(t, ·), QM (t, ·) are continuous for a.a. t ∈ (0, T )
and QL(·, u), QM (·, u) are measurable for all u ∈ V . Assume that

kQL(t, u)kX ∗ ≤ C(F (t) + kukV ),

kQM (t, u)kX ∗ ≤ C(F (t) + kukm

V ), hQM (t, u), ui ≤ 0.

(3.22)

(3.23)

for all u ∈ X and a.a.
m ≥ 1, mθ < 1. Then the Cauchy problem

t ∈ (0, T ), where F ∈ L2(0, T ) is independent of u, and

u′(t) + Au(t) = QL(t, u(t)) + QM (t, u(t)),

u|t=0 = u0,

(3.24)

has a solution in the class

L2(0, T ; X) ∩ H 1(0, T ; X ∗) ∩ L2/θ(0, T ; V ) ∩ C([0, T ]; Y )

(3.25)

for every u0 ∈ Y .

14

Proof. 1. Consider the Banach space

W := L2(0, T ; X) ∩ H 1(0, T ; X ∗)

with the natural intersection norm. By the Aubin-Lions-Simon lemma [16], the em-
bedding W ⊂ L2(0, T ; V ) is compact. Moreover, by [20, Lemma 2.2.7 and Corollary
2.2.3] any function from W may be considered as an element of C([0, T ]; Y ), and the
embedding W ⊂ C([0, T ]; Y ) is continuous. Due to (3.21),

kukL2/θ(0;T ;V ) ≤ kukθ

L2(0,T ;X)kuk1−θ

L∞(0,T ;Y ),

(3.26)

therefore the embedding W ⊂ L2/θ(0; T ; V ) is also continuous. By [16, Corollary
6], the embedding W ⊂ L2m(0; T ; V ) is compact (as 2m < 2/θ). The Nemytskii
operators

QL(·, u) : L2(0, T ; V ) → L2(0, T ; X ∗),
QM (·, u) : L2m(0, T ; V ) → L2(0, T ; X ∗)

are bounded and continuous by the Lucchetti-Patrone theorem [14, 15]. Hence, the
Nemytskii operators

QL(·, u), QM (·, u) : W → L2(0, T ; X ∗)

are continuous and compact.

2. Consider the family of Cauchy problems

u′ + Au = λ(QL(t, u) + QM (t, u)),

u|t=0 = u0,

(3.27)

where λ ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter. We are going to prove that the solutions of (3.27)
are a priori bounded in the space W , uniformly in λ. Taking the scalar product in
Y of (3.27) and u a.e. in (0, T ), we infer

By Gr¨onwall’s lemma,

kukL2(0,T ;X) + kukL∞(0,T ;Y ) ≤ C,

hence, by (3.26),

Consequently, (3.27) together with (3.22), (3.23) yields

kukL2m(0,T ;V ) ≤ C.

ku′kL2(0,T ;X ∗) ≤ C.

(3.31)

(3.32)

(3.33)

3. By [20, Lemma 3.1.3] and Banach’s continuous inverse theorem, the linear

operator

˜A : W → Y × L2(0, T ; X ∗),

˜A(u) = (u|t=0, u′ + Au)

is continuously invertible. Now (3.27) can be rewritten as

u = λ ˜A−1(0, QL(·, u) + QM (·, u)).

(3.34)

The operator ˜Q(u) := ˜A−1(0, QL(·, u) + QM (·, u)) is continuous and compact in W ,
and the solutions of (3.34) are uniformly bounded in W . By Schaefer’s ﬁxed point
theorem [8], ˜Q has a ﬁxed point, which is obviously a solution of (3.24).

3.3 Proof of Theorem 3.3.

In order to prove the theorem we ﬁrst need to study the following auxiliary problem:

∂tu + δBu = div(cid:18)|∇u|2p(·)−2∇u

ǫ + |∇u|p(·) (cid:19) + f (·, u),

u(0, x) = u0(x).

(3.35)




Here ǫ, δ are positive parameters; the operator B and the boundary conditions are
to be speciﬁed below.

Consider the Hilbert triple

(H r(Ω)N , L2(Ω)N , ((H r(Ω))∗)N )

where

n

2(cid:17) (p+ + 1)

r >(cid:16)1 +

16

is a ﬁxed number. Denote by B the Riesz bijection between the spaces (H r)N and
((H r)∗)N .

The weak form of (3.35) (with a certain implicit boundary condition which is of
no importance to us) is the following Cauchy problem, where the ﬁrst equality is
understood as an ODE in the space ((H r)∗)N , whereas the second equality is in the
sense of the space (L2)N :

u′ + δBu = Q(t, u) + f (t, ·, u),

u|t=0 = u0.

(3.36)

Here the operator Q : (0, T ) × C 1(Ω)N → ((H r(Ω))∗)N is determined by the duality

hQ(t, u), wi = −(cid:18)|∇u|2p(t,·)−2∇u

ǫ + |∇u|p(t,·)

, ∇w(cid:19) ,

∀w ∈ (H r)N ,

and the prime stands for the time derivative.

Lemma 3.5. Let u0 ∈ L2(Ω)N , ˜f ∈ L2(Q). The Cauchy problem (3.36) admits a
solution u in the class

L2(0, T ; (H r(Ω))N ) ∩ H 1(0, T ; ((H r(Ω))∗)N ) ∩ C([0, T ]; (L2(Ω))N ).

(3.37)

The solution satisﬁes the following inequality:

Since rθ > 1 + n

kukH rθ ≤ Ckukθ

H rkuk1−θ
L2 .

kukC1(Ω) ≤ CkukH rθ,

(3.39)

(3.40)

so (3.21) is satisﬁed. Moreover, the embedding H r(Ω)N ⊂ C 1(Ω)N is compact. The
operators Q, f : (0, T ) × C 1(Ω)N → ((H r(Ω))∗)N satisfy the Carath´eodory condition.
Moreover, f satisﬁes condition (3.22) since

kf (t, ·, u)k((H r(Ω))∗)N ≤ kf (t, ·, u)kL2(Ω)N ≤ k ˜f (t)kL2(Ω) + CkukC1(Ω)N ,

(3.41)

and ˜f ∈ L2(0, T ; L2(Ω)). Furthermore, Q satisﬁes (3.23) since

kQ(t, u)k((H r(Ω))∗)N ≤ kQ(t, u)k((H 1(Ω))∗)N ≤ZΩ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

≤ZΩ(cid:0)1 + |∇u|p+−1(cid:1) ≤ C(1 + kukp+

Thus, the conditions of Lemma 3.4 are met, and the existence of solution u follows
immediately.

2. We now ﬁx a suﬃciently smooth function w : Q → R and an open set U,
Y ⊂ U ⊂ Q. Test (3.36) with 2(u − w)(t), 0 ≤ t ≤ t∗ ≤ T , in the sense of
(((H r(Ω))∗)N , H r(Ω)N )-duality, and integrate in time to obtain

C1(Ω)N ).

Observation 3.6. In Lemma 3.5, the solution u satisﬁes the a priori bound

kukL2(0,T ;(H r(Ω))N ) + kukH 1(0,T ;((H r (Ω))∗)N ) + kukC([0,T ];(L2(Ω))N ) ≤ C,

(3.46)

which comes from the proof of Lemma 3.4. We claim that the constant C here does
not depend on ǫ (but may depend on δ). This follows from the fact that the operator
QM = Q satisﬁes estimate (3.23) uniformly in ǫ, see (3.42). Moreover, from (3.30)
we can derive that

δkuk2

L2(0,T ;(H r(Ω))N ) ≤ C,

(3.47)

where C is independent of ǫ, δ.

To prove the theorem, we are going to pass to the limit in (3.51), (3.52), (3.53),

ﬁrst as ǫ → 0, and then as δ → 0.

20

3. Take a sequence of solutions (uk, Zk) to (3.36) with ǫ = ǫk → 0. Due to (3.46),

(3.49), without loss of generality we have

uk → u weakly in L2(0, T ; (H r(Ω))N ),
uk → u weakly∗ in L∞(0, T ; (L2(Ω))N ),
k → u′ weakly in L2(0, T ; ((H r(Ω))∗)N ),
u′
Zk → Z weakly∗ in L2(0, T ; L∞(Ω; M)).

(3.54)

(3.55)

(3.56)
(3.57)

By the Aubin-Lions-Simon lemma [16],

uk → u strongly in L2(Q)N and in C([0, T ]; ((H r(Ω))∗)N ).

(3.58)

Hence, by a classical continuity property of Nemytskii operators [11],

f (·, uk) → f (·, u) strongly in L2(Q)N .

Moreover, by [16, Corollary 6] (cf. the proof of Lemma 3.4),

uk → u strongly in L2p+(0, T ; C 1(Ω)N ).

Consequently, employing (2.1),

and

∇uk → ∇u strongly in Lp(·)(Q; M),

V P V p(·)(uk)(V ) → V P V p(·)(u)(V )

(3.59)

(3.60)

(3.61)

(3.62)

for any Borel set V ⊂ Q. We can thus pass to the limit as k → ∞ in (3.51),(3.53)
and in the linear (w.r.t. u) and constant (w.r.t. k) members of (3.52), and in the
third term in (3.52). We can also pass to the limit inferior, keeping the sign of the
inequality, in the ﬁrst member of (3.52), since this term is lower semicontinuous, see
the δ-limit below in the proof for the details of a similar reasoning. Finally, by the
Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem,

|∇w|2p(·)−2
ǫk + |∇w|p(·) ∇w → |∇w|p(·)−2∇w

21

in L2(Q\U)N . Hence, passing to the limit in (3.52) we get

(3.64)

ku(t∗)k2 + V P V p(·)(u) ≤ C,

Then, by (3.50) and (3.62),

(3.68)

All the constants C here are δ-independent.

5. As a result of the previous steps, we can ﬁnd a sequence of pairs (um, Zm)
satisfying (3.51),(3.53),(3.63) with δ = δm → 0. Due to the δ-independent estimates
(3.65), (3.66), (3.68), without loss of generality we may assume that

um → u weakly∗ in L∞(0, T ; (L2(Ω))N ) and weakly in L2(Q)N ,

m → u′ weakly in Lmin(p′

Zm → Z weakly in Lp′

+(Q; M).

(3.69)

(3.70)

(3.71)

22

By the Aubin-Lions-Simon lemma [16] and bounds (3.67), (3.68),

um → u strongly in L1(Q)N ,

and thus without loss of generality

um → u a.e. in Q.

(3.72)

(3.73)

As above, we can pass to the limit in (3.51),(3.53) and in the linear and constant
members of (3.63). Note that the second member in (3.51) goes to zero by virtue of
(3.47), and the last member of (3.63) also goes to zero. For a.a. t∗ ∈ (0, T ), we can
pass to the limit inferior, keeping the sign of the inequality, in the ﬁrst member of
(3.63) (we test (3.63) by smooth compactly supported nonnegative scalar functions
of time, and pass to the limit in the sense of scalar distributions, see [13, 19, 17] for
technical details in similar situations). By Theorem 2.12, u ∈ BV P V p(·) and we can
pass to the limit inferior in the V P V p(·)-term.

It remains to pass to the limit in the penultimate term of (3.63) involving the

ﬁdelity. By [15, Theorem 2.6], (3.69) and (3.73) yield

f (·, um) → f (·, u) weakly in L2(Q)N .

(3.74)

Consider the functional

F : L2(Q)N → R, F (u) =ZQt∗

f (t, x, u(t, x)) · u(t, x) dx dt.

A classical result on Nemytskii operators [11, 15] implies that F is bounded and con-
tinuous. Since the function v 7→ v · f (t, x, v) is concave, F is concave and therefore
weakly upper semicontinuous. This fact together with (3.69) and (3.74) gives the op-
portunity to pass to the limit superior in the penultimate term of (3.63), maintaining
the sign of the inequality.

Hence, in the limit we get

ku(t∗) − w(t∗)k2 + 2ZQt∗

∂tw(t, x) · u(t, x) dx dt + 2 V P V p(·)(u)(Qt∗ ∩ U)

+ 2ZQt∗

f (t, x, u(t, x)) · (u(t, x) − w(t, x)) dx dt

(3.75)

23

for a.a. t∗ ∈ (0, T ). By a Lions-Magenes lemma [20, Lemma 2.2.6],

u ∈ Cw(0, T ; L2(Ω)N ).

Therefore, the ﬁrst term of (3.75) is lower semicontinuous in time. Since V P V p(·)(u)
is a Radon measure on Q, the third term is also lower semicontinuous in time. The
remaining members are continuous in time. Hence, (3.75) holds for all t∗ ∈ [0, T ],
in particular, for t∗ = T . Thus, (u, Z) satisﬁes (3.4), (3.5), (3.6). By density, the
test functions v and w in (3.4) and (3.5) can be taken from the spaces indicated in
Deﬁnition 3.1.

3.4 Semigroup solutions

In this section we assume that p does not depend on time,
i.e. we have a Y -
semicontinuous variable exponent p : Ω → [1, p+], and Y = [p(x) = 1] is the critical
set in Ω. To ﬁx the ideas and avoid unnecessary techicalities, we also assume that
f ≡ 0. We are thus left with the following Neumann problem:

∂tu(t, x) = div Z(t, x),
Z(t, x) = |∇u(t, x)|p(x)−2∇u(t, x),
Z(t, x)ν(x) = 0, x ∈ ∂Ω,
u(0, x) = u0(x).

otherwise.

(3.77)

Getting rid of the auxiliary variable Z, it is easy to observe that (3.76) is a formal

gradient ﬂow of Ψ in L2(Ω)N :

u′ + gradL2(Ω)N Ψ(u) = 0.

However, the functional Ψ is not regular enough to employ this fact immediately.
But we still have

Lemma 3.7. The functional Ψ is proper, convex, lower-semicontinuous and has a
dense domain.

Proof. The lower-semicontinuity can be checked in a way similar to Theorem 2.12
(see also [10]). The rest is obvious.

Lemma 3.7 implies that the subdiﬀerential ∂Ψ has a dense domain dom ∂Ψ,
see [5, Subsection 17.2.2]. For convex lower semicontinuous functionals, the notion
of subdiﬀerential is the correct extension of the notion of gradient, see again [5,
Subsection 17.2.2]. We can thus give the following deﬁnition, which is also motivated
by [4, 3] and by [1, 2].

Deﬁnition 3.8. A function

W 1,∞

loc ((0, +∞); L2(Ω)N ) ∩ C([0, +∞); L2(Ω)N )

is called a semigroup solution to (3.76) provided

for all t ≥ 0,

for a.a. t > 0, and

u(t) ∈ dom ∂Ψ

0 ∈ u′ + ∂Ψ(u).

u(0) = u0.

(3.78)

(3.79)

By [5, Theorem 17.2.3], we shortly have

Theorem 3.9. For any u0 ∈ L2(Ω)N , there is a unique semigroup solution to (3.76).

Remark 3.10. Semigroup solutions automatically have plenty of nice properties pro-
vided by the gradient ﬂow structure, such as continuous dependence on u0 and long-
time convergence to the inﬁmum of Ψ, we refer to [5, Section 17] for the details.

Observation 3.11. Let (u, Z) be a suﬃciently regular weak solution to (3.76) in the
sense of Deﬁnition 3.1. We claim that u is a (unique) semigroup solution. Indeed, ﬁx
an element h ∈ (BV p(·)(Ω))N ∩ L2(Ω)N . For any s ≥ 1, let us introduce the function

ψs : M → R, ψs(A) =

|A|s

s

.

Then we can rewrite (3.14) and (3.17) in the subdiﬀerential form

Z(t, x) ∈ ∂ψp(x)(∇u(t, x))

(3.80)

a.e. in Q. In particular, for a.a. x ∈ Ω\Y we have

ψp(x)(∇(u + h)(t, x)) ≥ ψp(x)(∇u(t, x)) + ∇h(x) · Z(t, x),

(3.81)

25

whence

ZΩ\Y

|∇(u + h)|p(x)

p(x)

dx ≥ZΩ\Y

|∇u|p(x)

p(x)

dx +ZΩ\Y

By [4, Corollary C.7] we have

∇h(x) · Z(t, x) dx

(3.82)

T V (u + h)(Y ) ≥ RY Z(t, x) d ∇(u + h)

kZkL∞(U ;M)

(3.83)

for any open set U ⊂ Ω containing Y . Since Z · ∇u = |∇u| a.e.
kZkL∞(Y ;M) ≤ 1, provided Z is continuous we infer

in Y and

T V (u + h)(Y ) ≥ZY

Z(t, x) d ∇h(x) +ZY
=ZY

∇u(t, x) · Z(t, x) dx

Z(t, x) d ∇h(x) +ZY

|∇u(t, x)| dx.

(3.84)

Adding (3.82) and (3.84), remembering that ∂tu(t, x) = div Z(t, x) and Zν = 0
Hn−1-a.e. in ∂Ω, and using [4, Theorem C.9], we deduce

Ψ(u + h) ≥ Ψ(u) −ZΩ

div Z(t, x) · h(x) dx = Ψ(u) −ZΩ

∂tu(t, x) · h(x) dx.

(3.85)

Trivially, (3.85) also holds for h ∈ L2(Ω)N \ (BV p(·)(Ω))N . Hence,

− u′ ∈ ∂Ψ(u),

(3.86)

and u is a semigroup solution.
