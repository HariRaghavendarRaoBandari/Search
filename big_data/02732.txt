Abstract

This paper presents a fast method for global search of atomic structures. The structures global

optimization (SGO) engine consists of a high-eﬃciency diﬀerential evolution algorithm, accelerated

local relaxation methods and an ultrafast density functional theory plane-wave code run on GPU

machines. It can search the global minimum conﬁguration of crystals, two-dimensional materials

and quantum clusters in a very short time (half or several hours). The engine is also able to search

the energy landscape of a given system, which is useful for exploration of materials properties for

emerging applications.

INTRODUCTIONS

Global search of atomic structures1–6 is very useful in material science, especially for the

exploration of new materials that play important roles in emergent applications such as

energy-storage7, superconductivity8,9, photocatalytic water splitting10,11 and high-pressure

materials12–15. Due to the complex energy landscape, the theoretical prediction of atomic

structures is extremely diﬃcult1,16. The conventional global search methods need tens of

thousands of atomic structure local relaxations1,2,17. Each relaxation is performed with

density functional theory (DFT) calculations and the whole search procedure is very time

consuming16,18. Therefore, it is critical to accelerate the search by highly eﬃcient algorithms.

There have been some groups that developed global search engine for atomic structures.

For example, Oganov et al. developed a package USPEX (Universal Structure Predictor:

Evolutionary Xtallography) for crystal structure prediction based on genetic algorithm2,19.

Ma et al.

set up a crystal searching method through particle-swarm optimization, and

obtained great success in high-pressure materials14,15,20. Catlow et al. used genetic algorithm

to generate plausible crystal structures from the knowledge of only the unit cell dimensions

and constituent elements1,21. Zunger and Zhang et al. used genetic algorithm and global

space-group optimization for inverse design of materials22,23. Besides, basin/minima hopping

algorithms have been adopted by many groups for atomic clusters searches17,24,25. Our

own PDECO (parallel diﬀerential evolution cluster optimization) procedure also showed

superior performance in the search of various clusters26. The activities in this area indicate

the importance of high-eﬃciency search algorithms for crystals, clusters and other atomic

structures from emergent applications.

In this paper, we present an ultrafast engine for structures global optimization (SGO)27

with acceleration on all the levels of searches. The algorithm on the level of global search

uses parallel diﬀerential evolution (DE) that has been demonstrated to be of high eﬃciency

in searching structures26,28,29. On the middle level, the local relaxation of atomic structures

employ curved-line-search (CLS) method30 and preconditional conjugate gradient (PCG)

algorithm31, both of which are based on force ﬁtting and have been demonstrated to be

2-6 times faster than conventional conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm32,33. On the level of

the energy and force evaluation, we use an ultrafast DFT plane-wave code run on GPU

machines34–37. The integration of three-level acceleration enables the ultrafast global search

2

of atomic structures. Tests for crystals, two-dimensional (2D) materials and quantum clus-

ters demonstrate its superior search performance. Moreover, this engine can also search the

energy landscape of given systems, which is useful for exploration of materials properties.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the search engine with the three-

level acceleration algorithms. Section 3 presents the tests on crystals, 2D materials and

quantum clusters as well as the searches of energy landscape. The concluded remarks are

drawn in Section 4.

II. METHODS

A. Overview of the SGO engine

Our search engine SGO consists of three levels, as shown in Figure 1. On the top level,

we employ an improved parallel DE algorithm for global search. On the middle level, CLS

and PCG algorithms are employed for accelerated local relaxation of each atomic structure

into its nearest local minimum. On the bottom level, the energy and atomic force of each

structure are calculated self-consistently by the DFT plane-wave code run on GPU machines.

B. Fast global search

The global search is implemented by a high-eﬃciency parallel DE algorithm. DE28,29,38–42

belongs to the family of evolutionary algorithms (EAs)43–45. It employs multiple individuals

cooperation and evolutionary operators to ﬁnd the global minimum of the objective function.

Compared to most other EAs, it is much more simple and straightforward to implement.

The main search engine requires less than 30 lines of C or FORTRAN code29,42. Due to very

robust control parameters and low space complexity29,39,42, DE is highly eﬃcient. Since its

proposal in 199528, DE continues to secure front ranks in various competitions and exhibits

superior performance than all the other EAs in most of optimization problems28,29,38–42.

Our DE search engine is an improved version of the conventional procedure based on the

characteristics of atomic structures optimization. The complete search ﬂow chart (Left mod-

ule of Figure 1) consists of initialization of individuals (i.e., atomic structures) on each node

followed by local relaxation to each nearest local minimum. Then, mutation and crossover

operators are implemented to produce possible descendant which are further locally relaxed.

We then use greedy selection and migration operators to determine the ﬁnal descendant

to next evolution. Such procedure is repeated until the global minimum is found or end

condition is reached.

Compared to the common DE algorithm, the conventional random initialization is im-

proved by chaos operator46 for small population, distance restriction and special constraints

for diﬀerent systems (atomic clusters, 2D materials, 3D periodic systems, adsorption sys-

tems, etc.). The following triangle mutation38 is used to boost global search:

Vi,G+1 = (Xr1,G + Xr2,G + Xr3,G)/3 + (p2 − p1) (Xr1,G − Xr2,G)

+ (p3 − p2) (Xr2,G − Xr3,G) + (p1 − p3) (Xr3,G − Xr1,G)

where Xr,G is the rth individual in the Gth generation and Vi,G+1 is the ith perturbed individ-

ual for the (G+1)th generation. r1, r2, r3 are randomly selected and satisfy r1 6= r2 6= r3 6= i;

p1, p2 and p3 are the weights computed by individuals ﬁtness. The conventional multi-point

crossover is replaced by the cut-and-splice crossover6,47 for fast evolution of atomic structures.

4

In the parallel scheme, the whole population is partitioned into several subpopulations, each

of which communicates with others by the migration operator41,42. These improvements

have shown high global search eﬃciency. More details about these operators can be found

in Ref. 26.

C. Accelerated local relaxation

The initial structure passed to the module of local relaxation (Middle module of Figure

1) is usually far from its nearest local minimum. Conventional relaxation methods, such as

CG algorithm32, need hundreds of steps to reach convergence30,31. It is thus crucial to speed

up this process.

We have proposed two accelerated local relaxation algorithms in Ref. 30 and Ref. 31. One

is CLS algorithm that is based on on-the-ﬂight force learning and a corresponding curved

line minimization algorithm. The new curved line minimization for ab initio landscape

is implemented on a guided curve provided by force-ﬁtted potential. The other one is

PCG algorithm, in which the pre-conditioner is provided by an approximate inverse Hessian

matrix. The corresponding Hessian matrix is given by force-ﬁtted Lenard-Jone potential.

Both CLS and PCG algorithms have shown a speedup factor of 2 to 6 on the relaxation of

most atomic systems. CLS, PCG,,conventional CG and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno

(BFGS)48 algorithms are provided to the user as the input relaxation option.

D. DFT plane-wave code on GPU

The computations of energy and atomic force of each structure (right module of Figure

1) are performed by PWmat34–37, a DFT Plane Wave materials simulation code run on

GPU clusters. PWmat is developed based on a CPU DFT plane-wave psedudopotentials

code: PEtot49. Compared to PEtot, lots of implementations have been greatly improved

in terms of algorithms and stabilities. It has simple input, very easy to use. It supports a

serial of tested set of pseudopontentials such as norm-conserving, utrasoft and PBE. The

current PWmat version (v1.0)34 has 20 times speedup over other well-known CPU DFT

codes. In our SGO engine, the structure energy and atomic force are given by iteratively

solving Kohn-Sham equations and self-consistently calculating electronic charge density.

5

The PWmat and SGO codes are run on custom-made GPU machines: Mstation (Material

Station)34,36,37. One Mstation has 4 GPU processors and 128 GB RAM, supporting the DFT

calculations of as large as 1,000 atoms. For global searches by SGO, the evolution usually

needs about 4, 8 or more individuals. In the case of 8 individuals, the local relaxation of 8

atomic structures can be implemented in parallel on two Mstations at the same time, or 4

by 4 in serial on one Mstation.

III. RESULTS

Because of acceleration on all the levels of searches, the SGO engine is expected to be

very fast. We tested SGO on the search of global minimum of various systems (crystals, 2D

materials and clusters), and presented its results on the search of energy landscape.

A. Search of global minimum

1. Three-dimensional crystals

We ﬁrst tested SGO on some well-known crystals with one (Si and Mg), two (SiO2 and

ZnO) and three elements (CaCO3 and BiFeO3). Table 1 lists the search results.

We can see that SGO can ﬁnd the known ground-state structure of Si and Mg in only

one generation with a small population (8 individuals). This success owns to the eﬃcient

construction of initial structures with chaos operator and distance restriction. For the other

cases with two or three elements, SGO are still able to locate the targeted global minimum in

less than 25 generations. They cost very few numbers of local relaxations and demonstrate

the global search eﬃciency of the designed DE algorithm. Moreover, all the calculations are

completed in only one hour on two Mstations.

Note that we do not use any symmetry restriction during the initialization and local

relaxation. This type of free search is more diﬃcult than the one using speciﬁc symmetry

restriction, but is able to search all the possible conﬁgurations in the whole energy landscape.

Figure 2 shows the evolution of the best ZnO individual in the population. SGO not only
ﬁnds the targeted zincblende structure (space group F¯43m) but also the wurtzite structure

(space group P63mc). In the used PBE potential, zincblende structure has slightly lower

energy than wurtzite structure.

Now we tested two known 2D materials: graphene and MoS2. The known ground state

of 2D carbon materials is a monolayer of six-member rings (i.e., graphene) while the ground

state of 2D MoS2 is a three-layer hexagonal structure with two S layers at both sides of Mo

layer. SGO spends 8.67 and 29.4 generations to locate these two conﬁgurations, respectively.

The costing time is a little longer than the one for crystals with the same number of elements

because there is one free dimension without periodic restriction. SGO does not constrain

atoms on a ﬁxed plane, but allow them moving freely. This free dimension will produce a

larger number of possible conﬁgurations and the corresponding harder search.

Figure 3 shows the evolution of the best individual of the population in one search of

graphene. This search costs 8 generations to reach the global minimum. The lowest-energy

conﬁguration in the ﬁrst generation is a monolayer consisting of ﬁve-member rings and seven-

member rings. This new conﬁguration also owns to the search without symmetry restriction.

It costs 7 more generations for SGO to evolve to the targeted monolayer consisting of six-

member rings.

conﬁguration found in the 1st generation is a monolayer consisting of ﬁve-member rings and seven-

member rings while the ground state found in the 8th generation is six-member rings’ structure.

3. Atomic clusters

The energy landscape of atomic clusters is more complex than the one of crystals and 2D

materials because there is no periodic boundary restriction. There will be a large number

of free clusters with stable conﬁgurations. We tested SGO on two Pt clusters: Pt10 and

Pt23. The known global minima of Pt10 and Pt23 have the point symmetry of Td and C4v,

respectively50. In our searches, SGO ﬁnd the Td Pt10 in 37th generations and the C4v Pt23 in

11th generations. For Pt23, SGO even ﬁnds more lower-energy structures. Figure 4 shows the

corresponding evolution process of Pt23 clusters. We can see that the ﬁnal minimum is about

0.35 eV lower in energy than the known C4v structure. This new minimum conﬁguration

has no symmetry operation.

FIG. 4. Evolution of the best individual of the population in one search of Pt23 clusters. Etot

indicates the total energy of one structure compared to the global-minimum structure in the unit of

eV. The conﬁguration found in the 11th generation is a known structure with C4v point symmetry

and the one in the 78th generation is the new minimum.

Compared to the searches of other systems, Pt clusters cost more computer time. There

are several reasons. First, the big vacuum around clusters and the large number of valance

electrons in pseudopotential magnify each electronic self-consistent calculation time. Second,

the complex energy landscape results in that each local relaxation needs more iteration to

reach convergence and the global search needs more evolving generations. Nevertheless,

several hours are still acceptable in exploring new stable conﬁgurations.

9

B. Search of energy landscape

Due to the ultrafast search speed, SGO is able to explore the energy landscape of a

given system in an aﬀordable time, especially exploring the landscape around the global

minimum. We tested this function on the systems of SiO2 crystal and carbon monolayer.

We adopted 9-atoms supercell for SiO2 and 8-atoms supercell for carbon. About 500 local

minimizations are searched for both systems. Figure 5 shows their found landscape, depicted

by local-minima energy spectrum.

For SiO2, SGO ﬁnds a few stable crystals in the energy region of [0, 1.0] eV close to

the ground state. The space group of the ground-state structure is P3121 (Figure 5d).

The conﬁguration 0.11 eV above the ground state has a higher symmetry with space group

P6222 (Figure 5c) while the one with 0.15 eV energy has space group P3221 (Figure 5b), very

similar to the ground-state structure. Both P6222 and P3221 structures have been conﬁrmed

in other studies51,52. Note that the relative energy between diﬀerent conﬁgurations could be

changed at diﬀerent pseudopential, external pressure and temperature.

FIG. 5. The energy landscape of (a-d) SiO2 crystal and (e-h) 2D carbon monolayer. Each blue line

in (a) and (e) indicates one conﬁguration. (b-d) and (f-g) are several representative conﬁgurations.

Etot is the total energy of one conﬁguration compared to the global-minimum conﬁguration in the

 

unit of eV.

10

For 2D carbon monolayer, there is no other stable conﬁguration except the well-known

graphene (Figure 5h) in the energy region of [0 2.0] eV. This indicates that there is a large

energy barrier from graphene to other structures. Thus, graphene is very stable, even at

high temperature or strong external interaction. The conﬁguration (Figure 5g) with 2.2

eV above the graphene consists of ﬁve-member and seven-member carbon rings. It has the

symmetry Cmmm and is also very stable. There are two stable conﬁgurations with about 0.7

eV higher than the ﬁve-seven membered rings’ structure. The lower-energy one (Figure 5f,

space group Pmmm) is made up of ﬁve-member, six-member and eight-member rings, while

the higher-energy one (space group Cmmm) is made up of four-member, six-member and

eight-member rings. Their energy diﬀerence is only 0.036 eV. Above these conﬁgurations,

there are a few other stable isomers with diﬀerent rings structures, such as four-ﬁve-ten

membered rings.

Note that the energy landscapes of Figure 5 are given by a limited number of searches

with a ﬁxed number of atoms in the supercell. There could be more conﬁgurations when we

use a diﬀerent number of atoms and spend more searches. Such energy landscape is helpful

to understand the known materials properties and to explore new conﬁgurations.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

An ultrafast engine SGO for atomic structure global optimization is proposed. We

speeded up the engine by a high-eﬃciency DE algorithm, accelerated local relaxation meth-

ods and an ultrafast DFT code run on GPU machines. We tested SGO on well-known

crystals, 2D materials and atomic clusters. SGO can ﬁnd the targeted minimum in half or

several hours. SGO are also able to explore the energy landscape of a given system in an

aﬀordable computer time. The code will be presented soon at the websites: www.sgo.ac.cn

and www.pwmat.com.
