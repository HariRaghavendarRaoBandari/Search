We study the development and saturation of the m = 1 one-armed spiral instability in remnants
of binary neutron star mergers by means of high-resolution long-term numerical relativity simula-
tions. Our results suggest that this instability is a generic outcome of neutron stars mergers in
astrophysically relevant conﬁgurations; including both “stiﬀ” and “soft” nuclear equations of state.
We ﬁnd that, once seeded at merger, the m = 1 mode saturates within ∼ 10 ms and persists over
secular timescales. Gravitational waves emitted by the m = 1 instability have a peak frequency
around 1 − 2 kHz and, if detected, could be used to constrain the equation of state of neutron
stars. We construct hybrid waveforms spanning the entire Advanced LIGO band by combining our
high-resolution numerical data with state-of-the-art eﬀective-one-body waveforms including tidal
eﬀects. We use the complete hybrid waveforms to study the detectability of the one-armed spiral
instability for both Advanced LIGO and the Einstein Telescope. We conclude that the one-armed
spiral instability is not an eﬃcient gravitational wave emitter. Its observation by current generation
detectors is unlikely and will require third-generation interferometers.

INTRODUCTION

With the recent detection of gravitational waves
(GWs) from a pair of merging black holes (BHs) [1], we
have entered the era of GW astronomy. Binary neutron
star (BNS) mergers are among the targets for the lat-
est generation of laser-interferometer GW detectors Ad-
vanced LIGO [2], Advanced Virgo [3], and KAGRA [4].
The direct detection of GWs from BNS mergers will re-
veal important aspects of the physics and astrophysics of
NSs. Accurate phasing measurements of the GW signal
during the late inspiral and merger in combination with
robust theoretical predictions, e.g., [5–7], will provide ac-
curate and nearly model-independent measurements of
masses and radii of NSs. This will help constrain the un-
known physics of matter at supernuclear densities [7–10].
Recent observations of NSs with masses ∼ 2 M(cid:12)
[11, 12] in combination with the distribution of NS masses
in galactic binaries, which peaks at ∼ 1.35 M(cid:12) [13, 14],
suggests that the typical outcome of mergers is the for-
mation of a stable remnant or of a hypermassive neu-
tron star (HMNS). The latter is a metastable object
that may survive for several tens of milliseconds before

collapsing to a BH [15–23]. The merger remnant is an
eﬃcient GW emitter [23] and its gravitational radiation
has discrete features (peaks) that could be used to pro-
vide additional constraints for the high-density part of
the NS equation of state (EOS) [19, 21, 24–29]. However,
the prospects for detecting this signal are diminished by
its high-frequency (2 − 4 kHz), which puts it outside of
the maximum-sensitivity band of current GW detectors.
Recently, [30, 31] considered the merger of spinning
NSs on eccentric orbits and found that the resulting
HMNS develops an (cid:96) = 2, m = 1, one-armed spiral
instability. Because of its m = 1 nature, this instabil-
ity results in GW emission at half the frequency of the
dominant m = 2 quadrupole mode, in a band of higher
sensitivity for GW detectors. Similar instabilities have
been previously identiﬁed in isolated diﬀerentially rotat-
ing NSs models [32, 33] and in NSs newly-formed in core
collapse, e.g., [34–36]. There are also strong indications
of the presence of an m = 1 instability in previous simu-
lations of spinning BNSs mergers in quasi-circular orbits
[37, 38]. However, the impact of this instability for GW
observation of BNS mergers is unclear. Especially in the
case of binaries with slowly rotating or nonrotating NSs
in quasi-circular orbit, which are presumably the most

common.

In this paper20160318 we present results of high-
resolution numerical relativity (NR) simulations suggest-
ing that the growth of an m = 1 instability is a generic
outcome of BNS mergers and independent of the NS
EOS. The one-armed spiral instability is only weakly
damped and persists for several tens of milliseconds.
However, we ﬁnd that the one-armed spiral instability
is an ineﬃcient emitter of GWs. Their detection by cur-
rent and near-future ground-based GW observatories is
unlikely.

II. NUMERICAL MODEL

We consider the GW-driven merger of two equal mass

q = MA/MB = 1, MA = MB = 1.35 M(cid:12) NSs.

We construct quasi-circular initial data in the confor-
mally ﬂat approximation assuming irrotational ﬂow [39].
We treat NS matter as a perfect ﬂuid and use two nuclear-
theory-motivated piecewise polytropic EOS [40] to close
the equations of general relativistic (GR) hydrodynam-
ics.

The EOS that we employ are designed to ﬁt the SLy
[41] and MS1b [42] interaction models. With maximum
non-rotating NS masses of 2.06 M(cid:12) and 2.76 M(cid:12) re-
spectively, these two EOS are representative choices of
a “soft” and a “stiﬀ” EOS. Thermal eﬀects during the
evolution are included using a gamma-law EOS compo-
nent with Γth = 1.75 [43]. The initial separation between
the centers of the two NSs is 50 km, corresponding to ap-
proximatively 9 and 11 orbits before merger for the MS1b
and SLy models, respectively.

The simulations are performed using the Einstein
Toolkit [44]. For the spacetime evolution we use the Z4c
formulation [45] of Einstein’s equations, implemented in
the CTGamma code [46]. The GR hydrodynamics equa-
tions are solved using the high-order WhiskyTHC code
[47–49]. Our numerical grid covers a cubical region of
2048 M(cid:12) (cid:39) 3025 km centered around the center of
mass of the system. We enforce reﬂection symmetry
across the z = 0 plane. We use the adaptive mesh
reﬁnement driver Carpet [50] to set up a grid con-
sisting of 7 reﬁnement levels, with the ﬁnest ones be-
ing dynamically moved to follow the centroids of the
two NSs. The inner most reﬁnement level contains the
NSs during the inspiral and the HMNS after merger.
For each EOS we perform simulations with four diﬀer-
ent resolutions having grid spacing, in the ﬁnest level,
h = 0.25 M(cid:12), 0.2 M(cid:12), 0.15 M(cid:12), and 0.1 M(cid:12) (corre-
sponding to approximatively 369 m, 295 m, 222 m, and
148 m). For the time integration, we use a third or-
der strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method [51]
with the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy factor set to 0.3. Fi-
nally, for our analysis, we consider up to the (cid:96)max = 4
multipole of the gravitational radiation as extracted at
future null-inﬁnity J + using the gauge-invariant Cauchy
characteristic extraction method developed by [52].

III. ONE-ARMED SPIRAL INSTABILITY

The MS1b merger results in the creation of a stable
NS, thanks to the large maximum mass supported by
this EOS. The SLy binary forms a short lived HMNS.
We ﬁnd the survival time to be resolution-dependent with
the 0.25 M(cid:12), 0.15 M(cid:12), and 0.1 M(cid:12) simulations showing
apparent horizon formation at approximatively 62.8 ms,
16.3 ms, and 14.9 ms after merger, deﬁned as the time
t0 when the amplitude of the (cid:96) = 2, m = 2 of the GW
strain peaks. We do not continue the SLy h = 0.2 M(cid:12)
simulation until BH formation.
In all our simulations we observe a spontaneous sym-
metry breaking of the system (e.g., [53]): small asym-
metries due to the ﬂoating point truncation error in our
code are ampliﬁed by the turbulence generated by the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the contact region be-
tween the two stars [17]. This seeds physical odd-m in-
stabilities in the merger remnant. Eventually, the m = 1
mode becomes the dominating mode violating the 180◦-
rotational-symmetry (π-symmetry) of the initial data.
The m = 1 mode saturates within ∼ 10 ms of merger.
Figure 1 shows that for the MS1b binary with h =
0.1 M(cid:12), the one-armed spiral instability appears to de-
velop similarly to the case of eccentric mergers [30, 31].
Hydrodynamical vortices are formed at the time of
merger (under-dense regions in the ﬁrst panel of Fig-
ure 1). These vortices subsequently migrate toward the
center where they join. This displaces the forming core
of the merger remnant and triggers the development of
a spiral arm. Note that some previous studies (e.g.,
[30, 31, 54, 55]) suggested that toroidal (maximum den-
sity in a torus around the center) rather than spheroidal
(centrally condensed) stellar structure was necessary for
the one-armed to develop. We do not ﬁnd this to be the
case: while our models exhibit slightly oﬀ-center density
peaks, they are globally spheroidal (cf. also [34–36]).

We estimate the strength of the one-armed spiral insta-
bility in an unambiguous way from the multipole decom-
position of the GW energy and angular momentum ﬂuxes
at J +. These are obtained from the spin −2 weighted
spherical harmonics decomposition of the strain h(cid:96)m at
future null-inﬁnity following [56]. The multipoles of the
energy ﬂux carried by GWs are

We show the (cid:96) = 2, m = 1 and (cid:96) = 2, m = 2 quadrupole
modes of the GW energy ﬂux in Figure 2. While the
(cid:96) = 2, m = 2 mode peaks at merger and then decays over
a timescale of several milliseconds, the m = 1 mode grows
after merger and saturates within a few milliseconds for
both the MS1b and SLy binaries. In both cases, the mode
appears to not be damped by hydrodynamical processes

after merger (t0). In the upper panels: merger and development of the m = 1 instability. In the bottom panel: roughly half
a cycle of the saturated spiral mode. The 180◦ rotational symmetry of the system is broken by hydrodynamic instabilities
originating at the Kelvin-Helmholtz-unstable shear layer between the two stars shortly after merger. This causes the spiral

and persists for the entire duration of the simulations,
i.e., up to 50 ms after merger in the MS1b case, or until
BH formation in the SLy case.

The energy released in GWs by the one-armed spiral
instability is several orders of magnitude smaller than
that from the dominant (cid:96) = 2, m = 2 mode. The
m = 1 GW emission is not dynamically relevant for
the evolution of the remnant in the ﬁrst several tens of
milliseconds. Even on secular timescales (for the MS1b
binary) the m = 1 mode does not appear to be eﬃ-
cient at removing angular momentum from the remnant
(cid:38) 100 s. For this reason, the
(cid:96) = 2, m = 1 is only very weakly damped by GW back-
reaction. This is in contrast with the behavior of the
dominant quadrupole mode, which is a highly eﬃcient
emitter of GWs and, for this reason, it is strongly damped
over a timescale of ∼ 10 ms [23]. After the (cid:96) = 2, m = 2
mode has decayed, the (cid:96) = 2, m = 1 mode becomes the
most luminous mode. As shown in Figure 2, this hap-
pens already 20 ms after merger in the highest-resolution
MS1b simulation. The dominance of this mode over long
timescales suggests that the one-armed spiral instability
might leave some imprint on the GW signal if it survives
for suﬃciently long time.

Figure 2 also shows that numerical viscosity in low-
resolution simulations can prevent the one-armed spi-
ral instability from fully developing. One could spec-
ulate that one of the reasons why this instability has
gone undetected for long time is that it might have been
suppressed in simulations performed at lower resolutions
and/or using more dissipative numerical schemes than
those used here. Another reason is the π−symmetry
that is assumed in many previous simulations, which ob-
viously prevents the instability completely. Finally, we
also remark that, while the instability is very evident for
stiﬀ EOS (Figure 1), it is less so in the case of softer EOS
(e.g., in our SLy model). In the latter case, it is diﬃcult
to identify from the inspection of density colormaps. A
modal decomposition of the density distribution or an
analysis of the GW multipoles are necessary to unam-
biguously reveal it.

IV. HYBRID WAVEFORMS

We construct the complete GW signal

in the Ad-
vanced LIGO band from our binaries by hybridizing our
NR waveforms with the tidal eﬀective-one-body (EOB)

FIG. 2. GW luminosity of the (cid:96) = 2, m = 2 and (cid:96) = 2, m = 1 modes for all simulations as a function of time from merger
(t−t0). The data are multiplied by a factor of two to account for the symmetry between positive and negative m. A contribution
from the m = 1 mode is present in all simulations, especially at high resolution. GWs from the spiral mode are subdominant
during most of the evolution, but show negligible damping.

model presented in [6]. We generate EOB waveforms us-
ing a publicly available code [57], starting at a frequency
of (cid:39) 10 Hz, corresponding to (cid:39) 18 minutes before merger,
and extending up to the moment of merger [6, 58]. We
include multipoles up to (cid:96) = 4. The resulting hybridized
waveforms are publicly available [59].

We align NR and EOB data as in [6]. We use the
diﬀerence between the two highest resolutions as a con-
servative estimate for the numerical uncertainty in the
(cid:96) = 2, m = 2 GW phase predicted by our simulations.
The diﬀerence is less than 3 radians at merger and less
than 0.3 radians in the time window where we perform
the alignment with EOB. Excluding the lowest resolution
simulation, which appears not converged, we ﬁnd better
than third order convergence in the phase and ampli-
tude of the (cid:96) = 2, m = 2 GW mode for both the MS1b
and the SLy binaries until shortly before merger. This is
similar to what was reported in [48]. As a consequence,
the de-phasing between the NR and EOB waveforms is
dominated by the residual orbital eccentricity and the
residuals are essentially ﬂat until shortly before merger
as in [6].

In order to be able to estimate the detectability of the
one-armed spiral mode, we extend the (cid:96) = 2, m = 1 GW
signal of the MS1b binary to (cid:39) 1 second after merger us-
ing a simple damped sinusoid. This is justiﬁed by the fact
that the (cid:96) = 2, m = 1 GW signal from our MS1b simu-
lations has a very stable instantaneous frequency and a
narrow spectrum. Since the (cid:96) = 2, m = 1 GW ampli-
tude in our simulations shows low frequency oscillations
of unclear origin, we are not able to reliably estimate
damping times from our data. Instead, we heuristically
set the damping time of the (cid:96) = 2, m = 1 mode in
our hybrid waveform to 100 ms. This value is consistent
with the amplitude evolution of the h = 0.15 M(cid:12) run,
but somewhat smaller than what could be inferred from
the h = 0.1 M(cid:12) data. However, other physical processes,

such as neutrino cooling and angular momentum redis-
tribution due to magneto-turbulence, will likely become
dominant over such timescales [20] and might damp the
one-armed spiral instability [60–62]. As a consequence,
our estimate of the survival time of the m = 1 mode
should constitute a reasonable upper limit.

V. DETECTABILITY

In Figure 3, we show the spectrum of the eﬀective GW
signals for the highest resolution MS1b and SLy hybrid
waveforms. For our analysis, we assume an optimistic
distance of 10 Mpc to the source, an optimal sky location,
and an edge-on orientation of the binary with respect to
the detector, which is optimal for the detection of the
(cid:96) = 2, m = 1 mode. We also superimpose the sensitivity
curves of Advanced LIGO in its zero-detuning high-laser-
power conﬁguration [63] and of the proposed ET [64].

We ﬁnd the spectrum of the GW signal generated by
the one-armed spiral instability to reach its maximum at
a frequency half of that of the dominant quadrupole peak
f2. It is thus conceivable that the detection of GWs from
the m = 1 instability could be used to constrain the NS
EOS, since f2 has been shown to encode properties of the
EOS at high densities [19, 24, 26].

We quantify the detectability of the diﬀerent compo-
nents of the GW signal by computing optimal signal-to-
noise ratios (SNRs), i.e., assuming an optimal detection
template [65], for Advanced LIGO and ET using the hy-
brid waveforms obtained from the highest resolution NR
simulations. We compute the SNR integrals using h+(f )
over the frequency windows 9 Hz ≤ f ≤ 8192 Hz and
1 Hz ≤ f ≤ 8192 Hz for advanced LIGO and ET respec-
tively. We estimate low-frequency (f (cid:46) 12 Hz) contribu-
tions to the SNR by extending the hybrid spectrum as a
power-law with index −7/6 at low frequencies [66]. The

FIG. 3. Spectrum of the eﬀective GW signal seen edge-on from a distance of 10 Mpc. We show the spectrum of the hybrid
waveforms constructed from the highest resolution data and the noise curves of Advanced LIGO and ET. The (cid:96) = 2, m = 1
spectrum is mostly concentrated in a narrow maximum located at half of the frequency of the (cid:96) = 2, m = 2 peak.

results of this analysis are reported in Table I.

Despite its large spectral peak amplitude, the detec-
tion of the m = 1 mode with current laser interferome-
ters appear unlikely. Even at the relatively close distance
of 10 Mpc, the optimal SNR for the (cid:96) = 2, m = 1 GW
mode of the hybrid MS1b waveform is only (cid:39) 1.6 for
advanced LIGO. For comparison, the threshold on the
optimal SNR for detection is typically set to 8 [67]. This
means that the one-armed spiral instability will be un-
detectable even for nearby events and the (cid:96) = 2, m = 2
GW mode appears much more promising for detecting
post-merger GWs from BNS mergers. This is even more
so for the short lived merger remnant of the SLy binary.

We also remark that our analysis refers to the case
of binaries seen edge-on.
In the face-on case the SNR
for the (cid:96) = 2, m = 2 mode is twice as large, while the
(cid:96) = 2, m = 1 mode is completely suppressed.

VI. DISCUSSION

In combination with previous studies by others [30,
31, 37, 38] our results for equal-mass, irrotational, BNS
mergers from quasi-circular orbits strongly suggest that
the one-armed spiral instability is a generic outcome of
the merger of two NSs. As we demonstrate in the cases
of both soft and stiﬀ EOS, even tiny asymmetries, neces-
sarily of numerical origin for exactly equal mass systems,
but expected in any astrophysical conﬁguration, are suﬃ-
cient to trigger the growth of this instability. Once seeded
at the time of merger, the one-armed spiral instability
quickly grows into a large-scale m = 1 spiral density per-
turbation, which saturates within a time scale of ∼ 10 ms.
Our results are supported by the analysis of well deﬁned,
gauge invariant, quantities at J +, and by a resolution
study.
We ﬁnd that GWs excited by the m = 1 mode carry
relatively little energy and angular momentum as com-
pared to those of the dominant m = 2 mode. As a conse-
quence, the m = 1 mode is very weakly damped and may
persist over secular timescales, while the m = 2 mode de-
cays over a timescale of ∼ 10 milliseconds.
The characteristic frequency of the GW emitted by the
one-armed spiral instability encodes important aspects of
the NS EOS. Unfortunately, as our analysis shows, the
direct observation of GWs from the m = 1 mode by the
current GW detectors appears unlikely. We ﬁnd that,
even using an optimal SNR detection threshold as low as
5, Advanced LIGO at its design sensitivity will be able to
detect optimally oriented sources only out to ∼ 3 Mpc. In
contrast, we ﬁnd a horizon distances for the post-merger
quadrupole mode of ∼ 20 Mpc and ∼ 27 Mpc for the
MS1b and SLy binaries assuming optimal orientation for
the (cid:96) = 2, m = 2 mode. This is in agreement with
the more careful analysis of results of conformally ﬂat
simulations by [28]. GWs from the one-armed spiral in-

stability will be a target for third-generation detectors
such as ET. For the latter, we ﬁnd an optimal SNR for
the (cid:96) = 2, m = 1 mode of our highest resolution MS1b
hybrid waveform of (cid:39) 14.4 at 10 Mpc using the ET-D
sensitivity curve [64]. This would put the horizon for the
detection of an optimally oriented source at ∼ 29 Mpc.
The most important limitation of our study is the omis-
sion of magnetic eﬀects. Very strong magnetic ﬁelds have
been shown to be able to suppress this instability in iso-
lated NSs [61]. Muhlberger et. al [62], however, found
that large scale hydrodynamical instabilities in isolated
diﬀerentially rotating NSs are not aﬀected and in some
cases are even ampliﬁed by the presence of magnetic ﬁelds
over a large range of magnetic ﬁeld strengths.

As a side product of the present study, we constructed,
for the ﬁrst time, high-quality hybrid waveforms employ-
ing state-of-the-art analytical models and high-resolution
high-order NR data. These waveforms are publicly avail-

able [59].
