We present a pulsed four-wave mixing (FWM) scheme via a Rydberg state to create, store and
retrieve collective Rydberg polaritons. The storage medium consists of a gas of thermal Rb atoms
conﬁned in a 220 µm thick cell, which are heated above room temperature. The experimental
sequence consists of a pulsed excitation of Rydberg polaritons via the D1 line, a variable delay or
storage time, and a ﬁnal retrieval pulse via the D2 line. The lifetime of the Rydberg polaritons is
around 1.2 ns, almost entirely limited by the excitation bandwidth and the corresponding motional
dephasing of the atoms. The presented scheme combined with a tightly conﬁned atomic ensemble
is a good candidate for a deterministic single-photon source, as soon as strong interactions in terms
of a Rydberg blockade are added.

Photons make very good ﬂying quantum bits (qubits)
because of their weak interaction with the environment.
The ability to store a qubit is essential for long-distance
quantum communication [1–3]. This works best if the
optical properties of the medium match the bandwidth
of the qubits. Scientists have achieved a high eﬃciency
quantum memory as well as a single-photon-level mem-
ory in a Λ-type atomic transition [4–6]. The quantum
information can be encoded in a polariton [7], which is
in a more general sense a coherent superposition of light
and matter. If the transfer to a purely matter-like excita-
tion is coherent and reversible, the quantum information
can be mapped back onto a light ﬁeld. To implement in
addition quantum information processing, strong inter-
actions between stored qubits are required. The atomic
excitation involving a high-lying Rydberg state matches
these requirements, as it allows for storage, control and
retrieval of optical photons via Rydberg polaritons [8]. It
also provides strong long-range interactions and blockade
eﬀects [9, 10], which enables novel quantum devices, such
as single-photon transistors [11, 12], quantum gates [13–
15], and deterministic single-photon sources [16]. Never-
theless extremely tight traps and low temperatures are
required to achieve such Rydberg based non-linearities.
If such quantum devices can also be realized with thermal
atoms, scalability and integrability is within reach.

Rydberg-EIT (electromagnetically induced trans-
parency) in thermal vapors has ﬁrst been studied in
Ref. [17] without any notion of an Rydberg-Rydberg in-
teraction. For the direct observation of interacting Ryd-
berg atoms at room temperature, a bandwidth-limited
pulsed excitation was applied to determine interaction
strengths corresponding to a few GHz, much stronger
than the decoherence rate set by the motion-induced
Doppler eﬀect [18, 19]. Many-body phenomena based on
this interaction like aggregation [20, 21] or optical bista-
bilities [22] have been studied in thermal vapor cells. If

one adds a de-exciation laser before the Rydberg states
do some unwanted stuﬀ like aggregation etc., the corre-
sponding FWM scheme provides the basis for a deter-
ministic single-photon source [23]. It is important that
the polariton lifetieme, or better said the coherence time,
is suﬃcient to produce a mixed wave fully coherent. The
Rydberg polariton lifetime can be limited by dephasing,
e.g. due to inhomogeneous diﬀerential light shifts in an
optical dipole trap for cold atoms [24].
In thermal va-
pors, dipole traps are not applicable but the lifetime is
now limited by motional dephasing. The corresponding
bandwidth determines the blockade radius for a given van
der Waals interaction.

In this Letter, we investigate the properties of thermal
Rydberg polaritons in the absence of Rydberg-Rydberg
interactions by a double-pulsed FWM transition. Some
of the incident photons are ﬁrst stored as matter-like po-
laritons. A pulsed retrieval laser converts the excitations
back into light-like polaritons, i.e. photons which we de-
tected. The retrieval laser is temporally delayed in or-
der to probe the eﬀective lifetime of the polaritons. We
present measurements for diﬀerent storage times of Ryd-
berg polaritons, and obtain the lifetime of polaritons to
be 1.2 ns for our given bandwidth of the excitation se-
quence. We detect the retrieved photons produced via
FWM by single-photon counters as we only address quite
small atomic ensemble. The retrieval light ﬁeld shows
motion-induced revivals, which can be attributed to the
constructive interference between the coherent evolution
of diﬀerent velocity classes [25, 26]. All these features
can be reproduced by numerical simulations considering
the contribution of a whole Doppler ensemble. It is im-
portant to note that the temporal evolution can only be
explained by a collective response of the ensemble and
not by a single-atom master equation. Such a collective
behavior is also necessary for the realization of a single
photon source as detailed in [23]. Rydberg interactions

FIG. 1. (Color online) Principle of the experiment. (a) Relevant energy levels and store-and-retrieve process: ﬁrst a pulsed two-
photon excitation to the Rydberg state |22Si, then free evolution of the coherence, followed by the retrieval to the intermediate
state |4i, from where the four-wave mixing process is closed by emitting photons at ∼780 nm. (b) Time sequence and intensity
proﬁles of the generated light and applied light ﬁelds. (c) Simpliﬁed scheme of the experimental setup. All laser beams are
co-propagating through a 220 µm thick cell. Four bandpass ﬁlters are inserted in front of a SPCM detector to suppress the
three incident ﬁelds. An additional neutral-density (ND) ﬁlter is used to attenuate the generated signals to the single-photon
level.

do not play a role here due to the low atomic density and
low principal quantum number (|22Si). However, our re-
search paves the way for the studies involving Rydberg
interactions and coherent control of the stored Rydberg
polaritons.

The experiment is carried out in a ∼ 220 µm glass
cell ﬁlled with rubidium consisting of the two stable
isotopes at natural abundance. The atoms are heated
above room temperature to T ∼ 140◦C. The measured
atomic density in the ground state |5S1/2, F = 3i ≡ |1i
of 85Rb is around 3.0(±0.8) × 1012cm−3. A resonant cw
795 nm laser reduces the atomic density to be 1.3(±0.4)×
1012cm−3 by optically pumping the populations into the
other hyperﬁne ground state. The schematic experimen-
tal timing and setup are shown in Fig. 1. The Ryd-
berg polaritons are created by a two-photon transition
with the cw 795 nm laser and a bandwidth-limited pulsed
475 nm laser of FWHM ∼ 2.5 ns, driving a resonant tran-
sition to the Rydberg state |22Si ≡ |3i via the interme-
diate state |5P1/2, F ′ = 3i ≡ |2i. After a time delay, a
pulsed retrieval ﬁeld with wavelength of ∼ 480 nm im-
prints the coherence onto state |4i = |5P3/2, F ′ = 4i,
generating the FWM signals at ∼ 780 nm. The tem-
poral delay between the two pulses is set by a variable
optical delay line, similar to Ref. [27].
In order to de-
tect the retrieved signals, four additional bandpass ﬁlters
are inserted in front of a single-photon counting module
(SPCM) to suppress the three incident ﬁelds. An ad-

ditional neutral-density (ND) ﬁlter is used to attenuate
the generated signals to the single-photon level. The rep-
etition rate is 50 Hz. All lasers are linearly polarized in
the same direction and co-propagating through the vapor
cell. The 795 nm laser is focused onto the cell with a 1/e2
beam diameter of around 35(5) µm. Both blue beams are
overlapped by a pinhole which is imaged into the cell to
provide a homogeneous beam proﬁle among the interac-
tion regime at a diameter of ∼ 67(5) µm. We determine
the peak Rabi frequencies applied in this experiment to
be Ω795/2π = 85(10) MHz, Ω475/2π = 160(10) MHz, and
Ω480/2π = 130(10) MHz. More details can be found in
Ref. [28].

The time-evolution of the atom-light system can be cal-
culated by a basic four-level transition model coupled by
three light ﬁelds [25]. We numerically solve the Lindblad
equation with the Hamilton operator in a four-level dia-
mond conﬁguration, ∂ ˆρv
velocity group v. The Lindblad operator L( ˆρv) includes
the various decays [29]. The corresponding Hamiltonian
with rotating-wave approximation is

δv,795, δv,Ryd, and δv,480 are the respective Doppler de-
tunings. The spontaneous decay rates from intermedi-

ate states are Γ2/2π = 5.7 MHz and Γ4/2π = 6.0 MHz
(from state |2i and |4i respectively);
from the Ryd-
berg state |22Si to each intermediate state they are
Γ42/2π = Γ43/2π = 23 kHz and transient eﬀects due
to the atomic motion give rise to eﬀective damping of
Γt/2π = 2.47 MHz.

The temporal structure of the retrieved signals is sen-
sitive to the incident laser intensities in a resonant FWM
transition [26]. Hence, we further consider the spatial
proﬁles of the beams. The 795 nm laser beam has a
Gaussian proﬁle with beam diameter 2w = 35 µm at fo-
cus, so that the Rabi frequency of the 795 nm laser is
Ω795(r) = Ω795,peake−r2/w2
, where Ω795,peak is the peak
Rabi frequency. We assume that the beams at 475 nm
and 480 nm have homogeneous proﬁles in the excitation
regime. In addition, the Gaussian atomic velocity distri-
bution is divided into linearly discrete intervals with 200
velocity classes, up to |v| = 500 m/s. Summing up the
coherence ρ41 from diﬀerent velocity classes with a Gaus-
sian weight, we obtain the collective coherence at focus
2kT dv, where
m is the atomic mass and k is the Boltzmann constant.

The connection of the coherence and the electric ﬁeld
can be derived by the wave equation of motion with
slowly varying amplitude approximation. We get

E0 and P0 are the amplitudes of the electric ﬁeld and
the polarization, respectively; n is the atomic density
in the ground state; d41 is the dipole matrix element of
states |1i and |4i, which is 1.67 × 10−29 C m; and ω is
the angular frequency of the generated 780 nm light ﬁeld.
We assume the amplitude value of the electric ﬁeld to be
z-independent since the Rayleigh range of the focused
beam is much larger than the length of the cell L. After
propagating through the atomic ensemble, we derive the
generated electric ﬁeld right behind the cell to be

The generated electric ﬁeld can be ﬁltered out by the
serial optical detection system. Taking into account the
apertures at the imaging system including two lenses and
one pinhole [30], we derive the detected electric ﬁeld after
pinhole Eout(r, t) by applying the Fresnel approximation
and phase transformation function right behind lenses
E(r, t)e−ik780r2/2f (f is the focal length and k780 is the
wave-vector of the signal light) [31]. By this method, we
get the time-dependent power P (t) and photon number

The experiment begins with a two-photon excitation.
Few photons are ﬁrst stored in the medium as Rydberg
polaritons after the pulse is over. The coherence ρ31
is then imprinted onto the D2 transition by applying a
retrieval pulsed laser at 480 nm after a variable storage
time. We ﬁrst measure the bandwidth of the coherence
ρ31 by systematically scanning the detuning of the re-
trieval laser. The storage time is ﬁxed at 3.1 ns. The
measured full width at half maximum (FWHM) band-
width is ∼ 500 MHz, which is the convolution of the ρ31
lineshape and the spectrum of the retrieval pulse.
In
the following measurements, the 480 nm laser is locked
at resonance frequency.

We then vary the storage times of the Rydberg po-
laritons. Looking at the dynamics of the retrieved sig-

(Color online) Dependence of the 780 nm photon
counts per pulse pair on the temporal delay (storage time) of
the pulses. Note that the storage time shown here represents
the time diﬀerence of the peaks of the storage and retrieval
pulses. The cyan and green dashed lines are the simulation
of coherent and spontaneous emissions, respectively, with the
parameters used in Fig. 2. The red solid line is the sum of
both types of emission. The error bars represent one standard
deviation based on the measurement statistics.

nals measured at short delay times (Fig. 2), we ob-
serve motion-induced signal revivals, as discussed in
Refs. [25, 26]. The atomic coherences diﬀer in both am-
plitude and phase for the diﬀerent velocity classes. After
the excitation pulse, the atomic coherences are evolving
freely according to their Doppler detunings with phase
∝ exp(-ik780vt). The temporal shape of the oscillatory
FWM signals can be attributed to the coherence inter-
ference of diﬀerent atomic velocity classes. The cyan
dashed lines are the numerical results from solving the
master equation and extracting the coherence ρ41. For
longer storage times, we observe slowly decaying tails of
the retrieved signals. We attribute this to the eﬀect of
spontaneous emission which in the simulation is derived
from Γ4 · ρ44× collection eﬃciency [30]. The numerical
results including both types of emission, shown as the
red solid lines, ﬁt the measurements well.

With 1.0 ns storage time, 9 retrieved photons are de-
tected. For shorter storage times, the signals are domi-
nated by the coherent collective emission; and for longer
delay times, the signals are mainly dominated by the
spontaneous emission. The cyan and green dashed lines
shown in Fig. 3 represent the simulation of the coher-
ent and spontaneous emissions, respectively, with the
parameters used in Fig.2, and the red solid line is the
sum of both types of emission. The adjusted density
in the simulations is 0.92 × 1012cm−3, which is in the
range of the experimentally determined density. An ex-
ponential ﬁt to the coherent part of the emission (i.e.
for storage times less than 6.5 ns) shows a polariton life-

4

time of 1.2 ns. The lifetime is not dominated by the
Rydberg population decay of 6.9 µs neither by the tran-
sient time (the time period that atoms move in and out
of the interaction regime is around 64 ns). The life-
time is inferred from the Doppler dephasing. Due to
the co-propagating conﬁguration of the excitation laser
beams, the eﬀective wave vector to the Rydberg state is
keﬀ = k795 + k475. The FWHM bandwidth of Rydberg
population is BWcoh= keﬀ · ∆v. From the numerical cal-
culation, we know that the velocity band of Rydberg-
excited atoms has a FWHM of ∆v = 52 m/s, implying
the bandwidth of BWcoh/2π = 175 MHz. The corre-
sponding Doppler dephasing lifetime is 0.91 ns, close to
the measurements.

In future works, we will increase the Rydberg quantum
number to 37 and above, for example, for which interac-
tion energy of up to ∼ 2 GHz [19] is much larger than
the measured excitation bandwidth. Moreover, for these
parameters a Rydberg blockade volume of ∼ 6 µm3 is
expected which can be matched by reducing the excita-
tion volume by combining a tightly focused beam and
a micrometer-sized cell. Therefore, this scheme can be
used for generating non-classical light ﬁelds [23].

In summary, we store and retrieve thermal Rydberg
polaritons in a bandwidth-limited double-pulsed scheme.
With 1.0 ns delay time, we obtain 9 retrieved photons.
The thermal Rydberg polaritons have a lifetime of 1.2 ns,
almost entirely limited by motional dephasing of the
atoms. Our numerical calculation including the spatial
proﬁles of the laser beams and also the light propagation
of the generated ﬁeld ﬁts well to the temporal structures
and lifetime of the retrieved signals. We propose that this
FWM-excitation scheme combined with strong Rydberg
interactions can be used for generating non-classical light
ﬁelds or manipulating quantum information carriers by
photons.

and one is a commercial setup. Both dye ampliﬁers are
pumped by the same pulsed Nd: YAG laser. The pow-

through the uncoated cell. The measured data in Fig. 2

1.1 × 10−5, which is close to the derived factor by con-
sidering the solid angle and the propagation loss.
