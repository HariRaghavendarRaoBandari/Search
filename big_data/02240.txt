We study the interaction between a massless scalar ﬁelds and the spacetime generated

by charged black hole surrounded by magnetic ﬁeld. The equations of motion are

written into a Heun form, and its analytical solutions are obtained. These solutions

have an explicit dependence on the parameter of the magnetic ﬁeld. We obtain

the exact Hawking radiation spectrum, the regular partial wave scattering, and the

resonant frequencies (quasispectrum) expression. The special case of a Schwarzschild

black hole surrounded by magnetic ﬁeld is analyzed and the solutions are shown.

I. SCALAR FIELD EQUATION IN THE ERNST SOLUTION

The spacetime generated by a black hole with electric charge Q in a magnetic universe

where the external magnetic ﬁeld is determined by the parameter B0, and the units G ≡

The horizon surface equation is obtained from the condition ∆ = (r − r+)(r − r−) = 0,

whose solutions correspond to the event (and Cauchy) horizons and are given by

Furthermore, the surface area of the horizon in the presence of a external magnetic ﬁeld,

In order to solve Eq. (7) in the background under consideration, let us ﬁrst estimate a real

astrophysical situation. This corresponds to match the Ernst solution with a Schwarzschild

solution at some large r through the neglecting terms higher than B2

0. These terms are

growing far from black hole, which turns the asymptotically far region divergent. Thus, the

Klein-Gordon equation can be written in the spacetime (1) as

where m = ±1,±2,±3, ... is the angular momentum quantum number, and the frequency

satisfy the following equations, respectively,

A. The angular equation

In order to obtain the analytical solution of the angular Klein-Gordon equation, let us

perform a change of variable such that

x = cos2 θ .

(12)

Quantum eﬀects in Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole surrounded by magnetic ﬁeld

With this transformation, Eq. (10) can be written as

This equation for the dependent variable S is converted into a Heun-type equation for U

by a F-homotopic transformation of the type

Thus, the linearly independent general exact solution of the angular Klein-Gordon equa-

tion for a massless scalar ﬁeld in the Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole surrounded by magnetic
ﬁeld, over the entire range 0 ≤ x < ∞, can be written as2

B. The radial equation

Now, in order to obtain the analytical solution of the radial Klein-Gordon equation, let

us use Eq. (5) to write down Eq. (11) as

Since this equation has singularities at r = (r+, r−,∞), by the homographic substitution

we bring Eq. (25) into Heun form as follows

Having thus moved the singularities to the points x = 0, 1, now we make the specialized

R(x) = eD1xxD4(x − 1)D5U(x) .

Note the dependence of both angular and radial solutions with the parameter B0, asso-

ciated with the external magnetic ﬁeld.

II. HAWKING RADIATION

The radial solution given by Eq. (35) has the following asymptotic behavior at the exterior

event horizon r+

4:

R(r) ∼ C1 (r − r+)

β

2 + C2 (r − r+)− β

where all constants involved are included in C1 and C2.

From Eq. (37), the parameter β can be written as

(41)

and the ‘dragging angular velocity of the exterior horizon’, ˜Ω+,B0, given by

Therefore, considering the time factor, on the black hole exterior horizon surface the

These solutions depend on the parameter B0, in such a way that the total energy of the

radiated particles is increased due to presence of the external magnetic ﬁeld.

Following the same procedure developed in our recent letter5, the relative scattering

probability of the scalar wave at the event horizon surface, Γ+, and the Hawking radiation
spectrum of scalar particles, |Nω|2, respectively, are given by

being T+ = κ+/2πkB the Hawking radiation temperature.

Therefore, we can see that the resulting Hawking radiation spectrum of scalar particles

has a thermal character. It is worth noticing that the total energy of radiated scalar particles

is increased due to the presence of the external magnetic ﬁeld, more precisely, this gives rise
to a kind of ‘dragging angular velocity of the exterior horizon’, ˜Ω+,B0, in comparison with
the scenario without a external magnetic ﬁeld6.

III. SCATTERING

If we consider the neighborhood of the irregular singular point at inﬁnity, the two solutions

of the conﬂuent Heun equation exist, and in general they can be expanded (in a sector) in

the following asymptotic series7

HeunC(α, β, γ, δ, η; x) ∼ C1 x−( β+γ+2

2 + δ

α)

+ C2 e−αxx−( β+γ+2

2

− δ

α) ,

(49)

where we are keeping only the ﬁrst term of this power-series asymptotics.

Thus, from Eqs. (26) and (49) we can see that the radial solution given by Eq. (35),
far from the black hole, that is, when |r| → ∞ which implies that |x| → ∞, behaves
asymptotically as

R(x) ∼

(50)

where all constants are included in C1 and C2. Thus, the radial wave function can be written

as

where σλ(ω) is the phase shift.

Therefore, the regular partial wave solution has the asymptotic form

sin[k0,B0r − γ0,B0 ln r + σλ(ω)] .

(55)

(56)

These solutions for the scalar ﬁelds far from the black hole can be useful to investigate

the scattering of massive scalar particles. It is worth calling attention to the fact that we are

using the analytical solution of the radial part of the Klein-Gordon equation in the spacetime

under consideration.

Indeed, the phase shift σλ is not a simple function of λ, the exact expression of the

scattering amplitude is not available but just an approximate one is obtained, as is shown

for instance by Abramov et al.8.

IV. RESONANT FREQUENCIES

We wish to solve Eq. (25) for the radial part R(r) subject to the following boundary

conditions: the solution should be ﬁnite on the horizon, and well behaved far from the black

hole. In order to have a polynomial solution of the conﬂuent Heun equation, we must impose

the so called δ-condition9

where n ≥ 0.

Thus, we obtain the following expression for the resonant frequencies

where κ± and ω±,B0 are given by Eqs. (43) and (44), respectively.

It is not possible to obtain an analytic expression for ωn from Eq. (58), however, there

are several numerical methods that can be used to obtain approximate expressions for each

energy level10.

V. THE ERNST SOLUTION FOR SCHWARZSCHILD BLACK HOLE

We now examine the special case of Q = 0 so that the metric (1) reduces to the

Schwarzschild form. Accordingly we have

∆ = r2 − 2Mr ,

Λ = 1 +

0r2 sin2 θ ,

ω′ = 0 ,

r+ = 2M ,

r− = 0 .

Therefore, the general exact solution for the angular equation, S = S(θ), is

S(θ) = C1 P m

(59)

(60)

(61)

(63)

(64)

(65)

(66)

where P m

l (cos θ), Qm

l (cos θ) are the associated Legendre functions with λlm = l(l + 1). And

for the radial equation, the general exact solution can be written as

(72)

In these solutions C1 and C2 are constants.

Thus, the relative scattering probability and the Hawking radiation spectrum, in this

case, are given by

Therefore, in the Ernst solution for Schwarzschild black hole, the resulting Hawking radiation

spectrum of scalar particles also has a thermal character. However, the total energy of

radiated scalar particles is not aﬀected due to the presence of the external magnetic ﬁeld.

The regular partial wave and the resonant frequencies expression for massless scalar ﬁelds
