We obtain a closed system of equations for scalar perturbations in a multi-

component braneworld. Our braneworld possesses a phantom-like equation of state

at late times, weﬀ < −1, but no big-rip future singularity. In addition to matter and
radiation, the braneworld possesses a new eﬀective degree of freedom – the ‘Weyl

ﬂuid’ or ‘dark radiation’. Setting initial conditions on super-Hubble spatial scales

at the epoch of radiation domination, we evolve perturbations of radiation, pres-

sureless matter and the Weyl ﬂuid until the present epoch. We observe a gradual

decrease in the amplitude of the Weyl-ﬂuid perturbations after Hubble-radius cross-

ing, which results in a negligible eﬀect of the Weyl ﬂuid on the evolution of matter

perturbations on spatial scales relevant for structure formation. Consequently, the

quasi-static approximation of Koyama and Maartens provides a good ﬁt to the exact

results during the matter-dominated epoch. We ﬁnd that the late-time growth of

density perturbations on the brane proceeds at a faster rate than in ΛCDM. Addi-

tionally, the gravitational potentials Φ and Ψ evolve diﬀerently on the brane than in

ΛCDM, for which Φ = Ψ. On the brane, by contrast, the ratio Φ/Ψ exceeds unity

during the late matter-dominated epoch (z <

∼ 50). These features emerge as smoking
gun tests of phantom brane cosmology and allow predictions of this scenario to be

tested against observations of galaxy clustering and large-scale structure.

INTRODUCTION

Cosmology, during the past two decades, has witnessed the introduction and develop-

ment of several bold new theoretical ideas. One, especially radical paradigm, involves the

braneworld concept. According to this paradigm (see [1] for a review), our universe is a

lower-dimensional hypersurface (the ‘brane’) embedded in a higher-dimensional spacetime

(the ‘bulk’). A new feature of the braneworld paradigm, which distinguishes it from the

earlier Kaluza–Klein constructs, is that spacetime dimensions orthogonal to the brane need

3

not be compact but could be ‘large’ [2] and even inﬁnite in length.

In the simplest and

most thoroughly investigated cosmological models, there is only one large extra dimension

accessible to gravity, while all standard-model ﬁelds are assumed to be trapped on the brane.

From the viewpoint of our four-dimensional world, this manifests as a modiﬁcation of grav-

ity. In the seminal Randall–Sundrum (RS) model [3], gravity is modiﬁed on relatively small

spatial scales. Apart from other interesting applications, this model was used to provide

an alternative explanation of galactic rotation curves and X-ray proﬁles of galactic clusters

without invoking the notion of dark matter [4].

An important class of braneworld models contains the so-called ‘induced-gravity’ term

in the action for the brane (it is induced by quantum corrections from the matter ﬁelds,

hence the term), and modiﬁes gravity on relatively large spatial scales. First proposed in

[5–7], it has become known as the Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati (DGP) model. Depending on

the embedding of the brane in the bulk space, this model has two branches of cosmological

solutions [8]. The ‘self-accelerating’ branch was proposed to describe cosmology with late-

time acceleration without bulk and brane cosmological constants [9], while the ‘normal’

branch requires at least a cosmological constant on the brane (called brane tension) to

accelerate cosmic expansion. The self-accelerating branch was later shown to be plagued by

the existence of ghost excitations [10]. Without any additional modiﬁcation, this leaves the

normal branch as the only physically viable solution of this braneworld model, consistent

with current cosmological observations of cosmic acceleration. It is this braneworld model

that will be the subject of investigation in this paper.

As a model of dark energy, the normal braneworld branch exhibits an interesting generic

feature of super-acceleration which is reﬂected in the phantom-like eﬀective equation of state
weﬀ < −1 [11–13]. Interestingly, the Phantom brane smoothly evolves to a de Sitter stage
without running into a ‘Big-Rip’ future singularity typical of conventional phantom models.

Such a phantom-like equation of state appears to be consistent with the most recent set of

observations of type Ia supernovae combined with other data sets [14]. The Phantom brane

has a number of interesting properties: (i) it is ghost-free and is characterized by the eﬀective
equation of state weﬀ < −1, (ii) for an appropriate choice of cosmological parameters,
even a spatially ﬂat braneworld can ‘loiter’ [15], (iii) the Phantom brane possesses the

remarkable property of ‘cosmic mimicry,’ wherein a high-density braneworld exhibits the

precise expansion history of ΛCDM [16]; for reviews, see [17]. Just like the Randall–Sundrum

4

model, this braneworld model was also used as an alternative explanation of rotation curves

in galaxies without dark matter [18].

The structure of the universe on the largest scales is spectacular, and consists of a ‘cos-

mic web’ of intertwining galactic superclusters separated from each other by large voids.

Whereas the full description of the supercluster–void complex demands a knowledge of non-

linear gravitational clustering, useful insight into structure formation can already be gleaned

from the linear (and weakly non-linear) approximation [19]. Linearized gravitational clus-

tering in the braneworld context encounters obvious diﬃculties and complications connected

with the existence of a large extra dimension. One has to take into account the correspond-

ing dynamical degree of freedom and specify appropriate boundary conditions in the bulk

space.

In the simple case of a spatially ﬂat brane, the extra dimension is noncompact,

and one has to deal with its spatial inﬁnity. The bulk gravitational eﬀects then lead to a

non-local character of the resulting equations on the brane. In spite of this diﬃculty, by

using a very convenient Mukohyama master variable and master equation [20, 21], some

progress has been made in this direction [22–28] by employing various plausible simplifying

assumptions or approximations. Most successful amongst these has been the quasi-static

(QS) approximation due to Koyama and Maartens [24] which is based on the assumption of

slow temporal evolution of (all) ﬁve-dimensional perturbations on sub-Hubble spatial scales,

when compared with spatial gradients (for an extension into the non-linear regime, see [29]).

This approximation, however, does not allow one to study the behavior of perturbations on

scales prior to Hubble-radius crossing, especially during the radiation-dominated epoch. At

the same time, numerical integration of the perturbation equations in ﬁve dimensions [30]

is diﬃcult and requires the speciﬁcation of boundary conditions in the bulk.

In our previous work [31], we addressed the problem of scalar cosmological perturbations

in a matter-dominated braneworld model. We considered a marginally spatially closed (with

topology S3) braneworld model, in which the ‘no-boundary’ smoothness conditions for the

ﬁve-dimensional perturbations were set in the four-ball bulk space bounded by the S3 brane.

In the limit when the spatial curvature radius of the brane was large, we were able to arrive

at a closed system of equations for scalar cosmological perturbations without any simplifying

assumptions. In contrast to the quasi-static approximation of Koyama and Maartens, our

approach took into account temporal evolution of all geometric components and matter on

the brane, which allowed one to trace the behavior of matter perturbations starting from

5

the matter-dominated epoch until the present time. In particular, for modes well inside the

Hubble radius during matter domination, the matter density perturbation δm = δρm/ρm

evolves as [see also Eq. (137) below]

δm = Ma +

W1
a5/4 cos

√2k
aH

+

W2
a5/4 sin

√2k
aH

,

(1)

where a is the scale factor, and M, W1, W2 are integration constants. Apart from the usual
growing mode Ma, we observe two oscillating modes with decreasing amplitudes. These
modes are induced by the dynamics of the so-called Weyl ﬂuid, or dark radiation, which

stems from the projection of the ﬁve-dimensional Weyl tensor onto the brane. Whether or

not the presence of such extra modes can be signiﬁcant for the braneworld model, depends

upon the amplitudes W1 and W2, and these, in turn, are determined by the primordial power

spectrum of the Weyl ﬂuid and its evolution during the radiation-dominated epoch. This

calls for a development of the theory of scalar cosmological perturbations for a universe ﬁlled

with several components, each with an arbitrary equation of state. Such a treatment will

enable one to follow the evolution of perturbations starting from deep within the radiation-

dominated regime all the way up to the current stage of accelerated expansion. This will be

the main focus of the present paper.

Our paper is organized as follows.

In the next section, we describe the background

cosmological evolution of the normal branch of the braneworld model embedded in a ﬂat

ﬁve-dimensional bulk. In Sec. III, we investigate the system of equations describing scalar

cosmological perturbations in this model. This system is not closed on the brane because the

evolution equation for the anisotropic stress from the bulk degree of freedom projected to

the brane (the so-called Weyl ﬂuid, or dark radiation) is missing. We solve this problem by

proceeding to a marginally closed braneworld and imposing the regularity conditions in the

bulk, as described in [31]. The system of equations on the brane (in the limit of a large spatial

radius) now becomes closed and can therefore be used for the analysis of perturbations. In

Sec. IV, we discuss possible ways of setting initial conditions for Weyl-ﬂuid perturbations and

investigate the evolution of all perturbations starting from super-Hubble scales until the end

of the radiation-dominated epoch. Perturbations during matter-domination are considered

in Sec. V. In Sec. VI, we present the results of numerical integration of the joint system of

equations describing perturbations in radiation, pressureless matter and the Weyl ﬂuid and

compare these with ΛCDM and with the results from the quasi-static approximation. Our

results are summarized in Sec. VII.

II. BACKGROUND COSMOLOGICAL EVOLUTION

Our braneworld model has the action [5, 7, 11]

S = M 3(cid:20)Zbulk

(R − 2Λ) − 2Zbrane

K(cid:21) +Zbrane(cid:0)m2R − 2σ(cid:1) +Zbrane

L (gµν, φ) ,

(2)

where R is the scalar curvature of the ﬁve-dimensional bulk, and R is the scalar curvature
corresponding to the induced metric gµν on the brane. The symbol L (gµν, φ) denotes the

Lagrangian density of the four-dimensional matter ﬁelds φ whose dynamics is restricted

to the brane so that they interact only with the induced metric gµν. The quantity K

is the trace of the symmetric tensor of extrinsic curvature of the brane. All integrations

over the bulk and brane are taken with the corresponding natural volume elements. The

universal constants M and m play the role of the ﬁve-dimensional and four-dimensional

Planck masses, respectively. The symbol Λ denotes the bulk cosmological constant, and σ

is the brane tension.

Action (2) leads to the following eﬀective equation on the brane [16, 32]:

Gµν +(cid:18) ΛRS

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

Gravitational dynamics on the brane is not closed because of the presence of the symmet-
ric traceless tensor Cµν in (3), which stems from the projection of the ﬁve-dimensional Weyl
tensor from the bulk onto the brane. We are free to interpret this tensor as the stress-energy

tensor of some eﬀective ﬂuid, which we call the ‘Weyl ﬂuid’ in this article (in some works,

the term ‘dark radiation’ is also used).

The tensor Cµν is not freely speciﬁable on the brane, but is related to the tensor Qµν

through the conservation equation

7

∇µ(cid:0)Qµν − M 6Cµν(cid:1) = 0 ,

(7)

which is a consequence of the Bianchi identity applied to (3) and the law of stress–energy

conservation for matter:

∇µTµν = 0 .

(8)

In a universe consisting of several non-interacting components, the conservation law (8) is

satisﬁed by each component separately.

The cosmological evolution of the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) brane

can be obtained from (3) with the following result [5, 7–9, 11]:

ds2 = −dt2 + a2(t)γijdxidxj

(9)

(10)

Here, H ≡ ˙a/a is the Hubble parameter, ρ = ρ(t) is the energy density of matter on the
brane and C is a constant resulting from the presence of the symmetric traceless tensor
Cµν in the ﬁeld equations (3). The parameter κ = 0,±1 corresponds to diﬀerent spatial
geometries of the maximally symmetric spatial metric γij.

The sign ambiguity in front of the square root in equation (10) reﬂects the two diﬀerent

ways in which the bulk can be bounded by the brane [8, 11], resulting in two diﬀerent

branches of solutions. These are usually called the normal branch (lower sign) and the

self-accelerating branch (upper sign).

In what follows, we investigate the evolution of perturbations in a marginally ﬂat
(aH ≫ 1) normal branch of the braneworld model embedded in ﬂat bulk spacetime
(which means C = 0, Λ = 0). This setup will enable us to obtain a closed system of

equations on the brane. The background cosmological equation (10) then reduces to

H 2 =

ρ + σ
3m2 +

or, equivalently:

1

ℓ2 "1 −s1 + ℓ2(cid:18)ρ + σ

One immediately sees that, in the regime H ≫ ℓ−1, our braneworld expands like ΛCDM
with the gravitational constant 8πG = 1/m2 and with the combination σ/m2 playing the

role of the cosmological constant.

Our braneworld is assumed to be ﬁlled with a multi-component ﬂuid, with total energy

density ρ = Pλ ρλ and pressure p = Pλ pλ. The usual conservation law holds for each

component separately:

˙ρλ + 3Hρλ(1 + wλ) = 0 ,

where wλ = pλ/ρλ is the equation of state parameter for the component labeled by λ.

In terms of the cosmological parameters

Ωλ =

Ωσ =

Ωℓ =

ℓ2H 2

,

(13)

(14)

where ℓ = 2m2/M 3 and H0 is the present value of the Hubble parameter, one can write the

evolution equation (12) in the form

h(z) =

H(z)
H0

=sXλ

Ωλ(1 + z)3(1+wλ) + Ωσ + Ωℓ −pΩℓ ,

(15)

where 1 + z = a0/a, and a0 is the present value of the scale factor. The cosmological

parameters are related through the equation

Ωσ = 1 + 2pΩℓ −Xλ

Ωλ .

For further convenience, we introduce the time-dependent parameters β and γ :

β = − 2s1 + ℓ2(cid:18)Pλ ρλ + σ

3m2

(cid:19) = − 2 (1 + ℓH) ,

3 γ − 1 =

˙β
Hβ

=

ℓ ˙H

H(1 + ℓH)

.

Then, from (12) and (13) one can derive a useful equation

˙H = −(cid:18)1 +

2

β(cid:19)Pλ(ρλ + pλ)

2m2

.

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

Restricting our attention for the moment to the present epoch, when the density of matter

greatly exceeds that of radiation, we ﬁnd

h(z) =pΩm(1 + z)3 + Ωσ + Ωℓ −pΩℓ ,

(20)

where

so that

Ωσ = 1 + 2pΩℓ − Ωm ,

β = −

3γ − 1 = −

√ΩℓpΩm(1 + z)3 + Ωσ + Ωℓ ,

2 Ωm(1 + z)3

Ωm(1 + z)3 + Ωσ + Ωℓ

.

(21)

(22)

(23)

An important feature of the Phantom-brane is that, for a given value of Ωm, its expansion

rate is slower than that in ΛCDM, see ﬁgure 1. This property of our model is of special

signiﬁcance when one compares its observational predictions with observational data [33].

Indeed, recent measurements of the expansion rate at high redshifts using the data on baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO) indicate H(z) = 222±7 km/sec/Mpc at z = 2.34, which is below
the value predicted by ΛCDM [34]. This tension is alleviated in the Phantom brane [33].

FIG. 1. The expansion rate in ΛCDM (top/dotted blue) is compared to that in the Phantom

brane with Ωℓ = 0.025, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 (top to bottom/solid), and Ωm = 0.28. One ﬁnds that past

expansion is slower in the Phantom brane than in ΛCDM.

The eﬀective equation of state (EOS) of dark energy on the brane is given by [35]

w(z) =

(24)

where the prime denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to z. Substituting (20) into (24) one

ﬁnds that the present value of the EOS is

w0 = w(z = 0) = −1 −

Ωm

1 − Ωm (cid:18) √Ωℓ

1 + √Ωℓ(cid:19) .

(25)

Consequently, the Phantom brane possesses a phantom EOS w0 < −1, just as its name
suggests.

III. EVOLUTION OF SCALAR COSMOLOGICAL PERTURBATIONS

A. General equations for a multi-component ﬂuid

Scalar cosmological perturbations of the induced metric on the brane are most conve-

niently described by the relativistic potentials Φ and Ψ in the longitudinal gauge:

ds2 = −(1 + 2Φ)dt2 + a2(1 − 2Ψ)γijdxidxj .

(26)

The components of the linearly perturbed stress–energy tensor of the λ-component of

matter can be parameterized as follows:1

µ

δT(λ)

ν =
−δρλ ,

∇ivλ
a2
where δρλ, δpλ, vλ, and ζλ ij =(cid:0)∇i∇j − 1

,

of the Weyl ﬂuid, or dark radiation, was set to zero in (11), perturbations of the Weyl ﬂuid

should be taken into account. Therefore, in a similar way we introduce scalar perturbations
δρC, vC, and δπC of the traceless tensor Cµν:

(28)

where δπij =(cid:0)∇i∇j − 1

3γij∇2(cid:1) δπC.

1 The spatial indices i, j, . . . in purely spatially deﬁned quantities (such as vi and δπij ) are always raised

and lowered using the spatial metric γij ; in particular, γi

j = δi

j. The symbol ∇i denotes the covariant

derivative with respect to the spatial metric γij , and the spatial Laplacian is ∇2 = ∇i∇i.

11

We call vλ and vC the momentum potentials for the matter components and Weyl ﬂuid,

respectively; the quantities δρλ and δρC are their energy-density perturbations, and ζλ and

δπC are the scalar potentials for their anisotropic stresses.

In this notation, the eﬀective ﬁeld equation leads to the following system for perturbations

in the Fourier-space representation with respect to comoving spatial coordinates [31, 36, 37]:

where k is the comoving wavenumber and β, γ were deﬁned in (17), (18). From the conser-

vation law (8) applied to each component separately, we have

δ ˙ρλ + 3H(δρλ + δpλ) = −

k2
a2 vλ + 3(ρλ + pλ) ˙Ψ ,

˙vλ + 3Hvλ = δpλ + (ρλ + pλ)Φ .

(32)

(33)

For simplicity, we have assumed here that the anisotropic stresses of all matter compo-

nents vanish: ζλ = 0. Note that in general relativity these assumptions would lead to the

equality of relativistic gravitational potentials Φ and Ψ, but, in the braneworld, this is not

the case due to the presence of the anisotropic stress of the Weyl ﬂuid δπC [see (31)]. The

contribution from δπC in the braneworld model cannot be ignored, but should be established

from the analysis of ﬁve-dimensional perturbations in the bulk.

The pressure perturbations δpλ are usually decomposed into adiabatic and isentropic

parts:

where

δpλ = c2

s(λ)δρλ + (ρλ + pλ)Γλ ,

c2
s(λ) ≡

˙pλ
˙ρλ

= wλ −

˙wλ

3H(1 + wλ)

(34)

(35)

is the adiabatic sound speed, and Γλ describe the non-adiabatic pressure perturbations. In

what follows, we restrict ourselves to adiabatic perturbations by setting Γλ = 0. At the

same time, the equation of state parameters wλ can be arbitrary functions of time.

Equation (7) serves as a conservation law for the perturbation of the Weyl ﬂuid:

δ ˙ρC + 4HδρC = −

12

(37)

In the quasi-static approximation proposed by Koyama and Maartens in [24], there arises

the following approximate relation between δπC and δρC:

δπC ≈

a2
2k2 δρC .

(38)

Relation (38) is properly justiﬁed on sub-Hubble scales, where k ≫ aH. As noted in Sec. I,
the Koyama-Maartens relation cannot be used to study the behavior of perturbations of the

Weyl ﬂuid during the early radiative epoch on super-Hubble spatial scales.

A more general relation between δπC and δρC was derived in [31] in the limit of a

marginally closed braneworld:

δπC =

3a4

2k4 "δ ¨ρC + 9H −

˙H

H! δ ˙ρC +(cid:18)20H 2 +

k2

3a2(cid:19) δρC# .

(39)

Relation (39) accounts for the temporal evolution of the Weyl ﬂuid, which makes it possible

to trace the evolution of perturbations right from their initial values on super-Hubble spatial

scales all the way until the present time. We shall use equation (39) in the present analysis.

To investigate perturbations of a multi-component ﬂuid, we introduce convenient vari-

ables

δλ ≡

δρλ

ρλ + pλ

,

Vλ ≡

vλ

ρλ + pλ

.

(40)

The variables Vλ are proportional to the physical velocity potentials Vλ = V phys

λ

/a. It is

reasonable to introduce similar variables for the Weyl ﬂuid. The Weyl ﬂuid, being described
by a traceless eﬀective stress-energy tensor Cµν in (3), behaves in a way rather similar to
radiation. Hence, since the background density of the Weyl ﬂuid vanishes, we use the

radiation background component to deﬁne

δC ≡

δρC

ρr + pr

3δρC

VC ≡

vC

ρr + pr

=

(41)

where ρr and pr = ρr/3 are, respectively, the energy density and pressure of radiation.

Naturally this assumes the presence of radiation during all stages of cosmological expansion,

which is certainly true for our universe after inﬂation.

In terms of the new variables (40), (41), we have the following closed system of equations

on the brane:

As one can see, perturbations of all matter species inﬂuence the evolution of the Weyl ﬂuid.

In turn, perturbations of the Weyl ﬂuid aﬀect the gravitational potentials via (42) and (44),

which inﬂuences the perturbations of matter via (45) and (46).

Using (50), (47), (48) and (49), we obtain

Thus, to determine the evolution of cosmological perturbations, we need to solve the

system of equations (47), (50), (56), (57). After ﬁnding solutions of this system, one can

use (54), (55) to determine the gravitational potentials.

B. Perturbations of a single ﬂuid

In this subsection, we consider the situation when one ﬂuid component dominates over

the rest. In this case, for the dominating component we can use a single-ﬂuid version2 of

(56) and (57):3

Remarkably, using (58), (59) and (53), one can derive a single second-order diﬀerential

3a2 (2 + 3γ)δC = −

(ρ + p)∆ .

(61)

The system of equations (60), (61) describes perturbations of a relativistic ﬂuid with

arbitrary equation of state w = p/ρ and whose adiabatic sound speed c2

s is given by (35).

2 Some correction from sub-dominant matter component might be expected from the term ∝ (Vµ − Vλ) in
(56) in the super-Hubble regime, when spatial gradients are neglected. However, for the adiabatic modes

under consideration in this paper, such corrections are absent due to appropriate initial conditions; see

Eq. (73) below.

3 We omit the label λ for the dominating matter component in this subsection.

Once the solutions for ∆ and δC are known, one can ﬁnd the momentum potentials

for matter and Weyl ﬂuid, namely V, VC, via the relations (47) and (58). After that, the

gravitational potentials Φ and Ψ can be determined from (54) and (55):

(63)

Finally, the evolution of all other (sub-dominant) ﬂuid components is described by (45)

and (46) with the gravitational potentials (62), (63) as source terms.

C. The Friedmann expansion regime

An important feature of our braneworld, which distinguishes it from the Randall–

Sundrum model, is that the eﬀect of the extra dimension on cosmic expansion is usually

small at early times [7, 11]. We refer to this early epoch as the Friedmann regime, since the

equations of (3 + 1)-dimensional general relativity determine the course of cosmic expansion

during this early time [see Eq. (11)]. Nevertheless, at the perturbative level, perturbations

of the extra-dimensional Weyl ﬂuid exist at all times and can never be ignored. Thus, we

investigate the evolution of perturbations during early times when

ρλ + σ ≫

m2
ℓ2 ,

Xλ

H ≫ ℓ−1 ,

(64)

implying that the eﬀect of the extra dimension (parameterized by the inverse length ℓ−1 =

M 3/2m2) on background evolution is small. In this approximation, equation (11) turns into

the Friedmann expansion law

(71)

Finally, we note that in the case of a single-component ﬂuid, we can, instead of (68) and

(69), employ the early-time version of (60):

¨∆ + (2 − 3c2
One ﬁnds that, in the formal limit of |β| → ∞, perturbations of the Weyl ﬂuid do not
aﬀect those of ordinary matter. Thus, we expect that perturbations of matter components
at early times will behave as in general relativity. However, the approximation |β| → ∞
is too crude and does not allow control of its accuracy [in contrast to the approximation
|β| ≈ 2ℓH ≫ 1, which was used to derive (67)–(72)].

3m2β

(72)

Below, we analyze the evolution of cosmological perturbations during the epoch of radi-

ation domination. We shall discover that the approximation (72) is quite accurate during

such early times.

IV. PERTURBATIONS DURING THE RADIATIVE EPOCH

A.

Initial conditions

The primordial spectra for scalar cosmological perturbations are speciﬁed deep within the

radiation domination epoch. At that time, the modes relevant to structure formation belong

to super-Hubble spatial scales, and perturbations of pressureless matter4 are decoupled from

those of radiation.5 As is well known, in general relativity, adiabatic non-decaying modes6

on super-Hubble scales remain almost constant in time, and are related to the value of the

17

gravitational potential as follows:7
3Φ(i)

δm(i) = δr(i) = −

2

,

Vm(i) = Vr(i) =

Φ(i)
2H

, Ψ(i) = Φ(i) = const ,

(73)

where the subscript ‘(i)’ denotes initial values, the subscript ‘m’ refers to pressureless matter,

and the subscript ‘r’ to radiation.

As the eﬀects of the extra dimension in our model weaken at early times, we expect the

above relations to also be valid in our braneworld during the radiative epoch (this expectation

will be conﬁrmed in the next section). We also assume that initial linear perturbations of

matter and radiation are random with Gaussian statistics. In this case, they are completely
characterized by the power spectrum Pm(k), deﬁned as

(cid:10)δm(i)(k)δm(i)(k′)(cid:11) =(cid:10)δr(i)(k)δr(i)(k′)(cid:11) = Pm(k)

4πk3 δ(k + k′) .

Cosmological observations, interpreted within the framework of the ΛCDM model, indi-

(74)

cate that the initial power spectrum is nearly ﬂat. The following parametrization is com-

monly used:

Pm(k) = Am(cid:18) k

k∗(cid:19)ns−1

,

(75)

where k∗ is a pivot scale which, in the Planck data analysis [38], is chosen to be k∗/a0 =
0.05 Mpc−1, Am deﬁnes the normalization of the spectrum, and ns − 1 is its slope. The
power spectrum is ﬂat if the scalar spectral index ns = 1, which is very close to the observed
value ns ≈ 0.96 [38].

We will see in the next section that perturbations δC of the Weyl ﬂuid, as well as those of

matter, weakly depend on time before Hubble-radius crossing. It is thus natural to assume

that the initial value of the Weyl ﬂuid δC(i) is also randomly distributed with Gaussian

statistics, so that

(cid:10)δC(i)(k)δC(i)(k′)(cid:11) = PC(k)

4πk3 δ(k + k′) ,

(76)

4 Pressureless matter in our investigation possesses all characteristics of cold dark matter.
5 Ultra-relativistic primordial plasma will be treated as an ideal radiation. Eﬀects related to baryons and

neutrino will not be considered in this work.

6 In this paper, we do not investigate possible eﬀects of isocurvature modes.
7 In terms of energy density contrasts this relation implies: δρm(i)
ρm(i)

= 3

4(cid:16) δρr(i)

ρr(i) (cid:17) = − 3Φ(i)

2

.

18

where the primordial power spectrum PC(k) for the Weyl ﬂuid can, in principle, be diﬀerent
from Pm(k) for matter (and radiation). Setting aside the issue of generation of primordial
perturbations, one can study the consequences of a general parametrization of the preceding

type (75):

k∗(cid:19)α
PC(k) = AC(cid:18) k

,

(77)

where k∗ is the same pivot scale as in (75), and AC is the normalization of the initial power

spectrum for the Weyl ﬂuid.

In this paper we do not discuss possible mechanisms for the generation of primordial

perturbations in our braneworld, and therefore cannot tell whether or not the primordial

perturbations of the Weyl ﬂuid are correlated with those of matter and radiation. For

simplicity we shall assume them to be statistically independent.

In this case, one can

consider the evolution of two basic modes:

Brane mode: initial perturbations of the Weyl ﬂuid are absent:

Am = A0 ,

AC = 0 ;

Bulk mode: initial perturbations in matter & radiation on the brane are absent:

Am = 0 ,

AC = cA0 .

(78)

(79)

Here, A0 = 2.2 × 10−9 deﬁnes the normalization of the primordial power spectrum, and c
is a numerical constant describing the intensity of the bulk mode. In the case of superpo-

sition of these two modes, the power spectrum of any quantity will be given by the sum

of the corresponding power spectra (since these two modes are assumed to be statistically

independent).

We note that, if the initial adiabatic perturbation for matter/radiation and for the Weyl

ﬂuid are not assumed to be statistically independent, say, if δC(i) is proportional to δr(i) due

to a common mechanism for their primordial generation (which we do not discuss in this

work), then the power spectra would be calculated by squaring a superposition of the two

modes.

In the following section, we consider in more detail the evolution of perturbations on

super-Hubble spatial scales in our braneworld model.

B. Evolution of perturbations prior to Hubble crossing

At early times, cosmological evolution is dominated by an ultra-relativistic component

(which has equation of state wr = c2

s(r) = 1/3 and can be treated as radiation). The
background cosmological equation (15) in this case can be approximated by the relations:

19

H ≈ H0pΩr (1 + z)2 ,

˙H ≈ − 2H 2 ,

γ ≈ −

1
3

,

(80)

where Ωr is the cosmological parameter corresponding to radiation. Radiation dominates
as long as ρr ≫ ρm, where ρm is the pressureless matter density characterized by the
cosmological parameter Ωm. This condition is valid as long as8

a
a0 ≪

Ωr
Ωm ≃ 2.5 × 10−4 .

(81)

Obviously, the inﬂuence of the cosmological parameter Ωσ in (15) can also be ignored at this

stage of cosmological evolution.

The leading braneworld corrections to (80) are of the order of magnitude 1/ℓH, where

the quantity ℓH is estimated as

ℓH ≈rΩr

Ωℓ (cid:16)a0
a(cid:17)2

≫

Ω2
m

pΩℓ Ω3

r ≃ 8.5 × 105 .

(82)

Since 1/ℓH ≪ 1, the universe expands as in general relativity and perturbations during the
radiative regime can be analyzed using the results of Sec. III C.

In this case, from (72) and (67) we obtain a system of two equations:

¨∆r + H ˙∆r −(cid:18)2H 2 −

∆r .

(83)

(84)

We are going to show that the right-hand sides of these equations can be ignored, by com-

paring them to some terms on the left-hand sides of the corresponding equation. To do this,

we need to estimate the factor (1 + 3γ) more precisely. Taking into account that the next

correction to (80) comes from the pressureless matter component, we compute

1 + 3γ ≈

Ωm
2Ωr

a
a0 ≪ 1 .

(85)

8 Here and below, for numerical estimates we assume the following values of the cosmological parameters

[33]: Ωm = 0.28, Ωr = 7 × 10−5, and Ωℓ = 0.025. In this case, Ωσ ≈ 1.036.

Next, we shall assume that, deep in the radiative regime, the following condition is

satisﬁed:

20

Under this condition, the system of equations (83), (84) simpliﬁes to

δC

∆r(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(86)

(87)

(88)

Perturbations with any given wavenumber k begin their evolution deep inside the super-
Hubble regime, where k ≪ aH. Equations (87) and (88) can easily be solved in the formal
limit k → 0:

+ ∆r(d)

δC = δC(i) + δC(d)

,

(89)

∆r = ∆r(i)(cid:18) a

a0
a

a0
a

where ∆r(i), ∆r(d), δC(i) and δC(d) are constants of integration.

The terms proportional to a0/a in (89) correspond to decaying modes. The inﬂuence of

decaying modes on future evolution is assumed to be negligibly small, so, in what follows,

these modes shall be neglected.

Let us perform more careful analysis of (87) and (88), allowing for non-zero k. Introduce

a new variable:

x ≡

k

√3 aH

a0(cid:19)2
√3Ωr (cid:18) a

,

k

a0H0

s ≡

(90)

Here, λ0 is the spatial scale of perturbation at the present time. From the viewpoint of

structure formation, the most relevant values of s are

102 <

∼ s <

∼ 106 ,

(91)

where the lower value corresponds to supercluster scales (λ0 ∼ 100 Mpc), and the upper
value corresponds to galactic scales (λ0 ∼ 10 kpc).

In terms of the variable x, equations (87) and (88) are written as

x2∆′′

r −(cid:0)2 − x2(cid:1) ∆r ≈ 0 ,
C + x2 δC ≈ 0 ,

C + 2δ′

x2δ′′

(92)

(93)

In the region x ≪ 1 (which
where the prime denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to x.
corresponds to k ≪ aH), we can look for solution of (92), (93) in the form of an asymptotic

expansion:

∆r ≈ δr(i)x2(cid:20)1 −

δr(i)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

which seems to be quite a realistic restriction on δC(i) for values of s in the range (91). Viola-

tion of (99), in fact, threatens a breakdown of the linear approximation. The validity of (99)

also ensures condition (86) at this stage of cosmological evolution. Thus, the approximate

solutions (96) and (97) are justiﬁed.

As we see, the variables δr and δC are both constant in time for modes which lie outside

the Hubble radius during the radiation dominated epoch. Using (70) and (71), we can now

estimate braneworld eﬀects on the evolution of the gravitational potentials. We start with

the potential Ψ:

Ψ = −

2δr(i)

3 (cid:18)1 −

4√ΩrΩℓ

s2

δC(i)

δr(i)(cid:19) ≈ −

where the approximation is valid due to (99).

To evaluate the potential Φ, we compute

Ψ ≈ −

ℓH −

6√ΩrΩℓ

s2

δC(i)
δr(i)

.

(100)

(101)

From (82) and (99), we ﬁnd |(Ψ− Φ)/Ψ| ≪ 1 prior to Hubble-radius crossing. Thus neither
the perturbation in radiation nor the gravitational potentials are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by

the Weyl ﬂuid during this period of cosmological evolution. As a result, our braneworld has

22

the same initial relations between the perturbation of radiation and gravitational potentials

as those in general relativity:

Ψ(i) ≈ Φ(i) ≈ −

2δr(i)

3

.

Using (96), we can improve this result to include corrections in k/aH:

Ψ ≈ Φ ≈ −

2δr(i)

3 (cid:18)1 −

k2

30a2H 2(cid:19) .

(102)

(103)

The evolution of perturbations in pressureless matter, whose background density is sub-

dominant in the radiative regime, can be determined from the conservation laws (45), (46),

in which the gravitational potentials Ψ and Φ act as sources:

k2
a2 Vm + 3 ˙Ψ ,

˙δm = −
˙Vm = Φ .

(104)

(105)

The system of equations (104), (105) can easily be solved with Ψ and Φ given by (103):

δm ≈ δm(i) −

Vm ≈

k2

60 a2H 2(cid:21) .

(106)

For the adiabatic mode, the initial values δm(i) and δr(i) are equal [see (73)]. Thus, in the

leading approximation, we have

δm ≈ δm(i) = −

3Φ(i)

(107)

The initial power spectra for the statistically independent quantities Φ(i) and δC(i) are

speciﬁed in Sec. IV A.

C. Evolution of perturbations after Hubble crossing

After Hubble crossing, when k > aH, the behavior of perturbations signiﬁcantly changes.

Modes most relevant for structure formation [see (91)] all cross the horizon during the

radiation-dominated epoch. In this section, we consider the evolution of perturbations well

after Hubble crossing.

Perturbations during the radiative regime are described by the general system of equations

(83) and (84). First, we obtain the homogeneous solution of these equations (i.e., without

their right-hand sides):

∆(hom)

√3 aH(cid:19) ,
sin(cid:18) k

√3aH(cid:19)# ,

23

(108)

(109)

where (108) and (109) have been matched with the non-decaying solutions (96) and (97) at

the moment of Hubble-radius crossing, in order to ﬁx the constants of integration (keeping

in mind that decaying modes have been neglected). Expression (108) coincides with the

general-relativistic solution in this regime.

Let us determine the evolution of modes deep inside the Hubble radius, where k ≫ aH.

Speciﬁcally, we shall restrict ourselves to the time period when

4 × 103 ≪

a0
a ≪ (1.2 × 102)s ,

(110)

when radiation is still dominating (ρr ≫ ρm) and k ≫ aH. The homogeneous solutions

Violation of (113), again, would threaten the validity of linear approximation. Thus, the

evolution of ∆r on sub-Hubble scales is reasonably described by (111).

However, estimate (115) can be violated, which means that the impact of ∆r on the evolution

represents the behavior of δC in the brane mode, while δ(bulk)

is its

behavior in the bulk mode10 [see the deﬁnition in Sec. IV A; equations (78) and (79)]. We

observe that the amplitude of the brane mode grows with time, in contrast to the behavior

of the bulk mode, which has decreasing amplitude in this regime.

As established earlier, the contribution from the bulk mode to the evolution of ∆r is

negligibly small, which means that the bulk mode of ∆r can be neglected:

back-reaction from δC in (83).

which is obviously valid in the regime under consideration, characterized by k ≫ aH, ℓH ≫ 1
and (1 + 3γ) ≪ 1. Consequently, the evolution of ∆r is described by the brane mode (121)
with high accuracy.

Finally, we are in a position to investigate the inﬂuence of the Weyl-ﬂuid perturbation

on the gravitational potentials. From (70), we have

under the same conditions (126).

For reasonable initial conditions that do not invalidate the linear approximation [compare

with (99)], and for values of s relevant to structure formation [see (91)], both conditions in

(126) are satisﬁed, and we can conclude that the Weyl ﬂuid does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the

gravitational potentials during the radiation-dominated epoch.

Perturbations of pressureless matter during radiation domination are described by the

system of equations (104), (105), in which the gravitational potentials Φ and Ψ act as

sources. Since the gravitational potentials are unaﬀected by the Weyl ﬂuid, the same is true

for pressureless matter perturbations, which thus evolve according to the general-relativistic

law [39]:

where C = 0.577 . . . is Euler’s constant.

Summarizing this subsection, we have established the behavior of Weyl-ﬂuid perturba-

tions in the sub-Hubble regime of the radiation-dominated epoch [relation (118)]. Since the

amplitude of the bulk mode in (118) decreases with time, while the amplitude of the brane

mode grows, one expects the brane mode to dominate during future epochs. Matter pertur-

bations in this regime are dominated by the brane mode, which exhibits general-relativistic

behavior. Deviations from general-relativistic behavior can, however, be caused by the brane

mode during the future matter-dominated epoch, which we discuss in the next section.

V. PERTURBATIONS DURING MATTER-DOMINATION

After transition from radiation domination to matter domination, we can once more

consider perturbations in a single-component ﬂuid. Thus, to describe the evolution of cos-

mological perturbations during this epoch, we use equations (60) and (61) with c2

s = w = 0:

where the time-dependent parameters β and γ are deﬁned in (17) and (18), respectively.

The system of equations (129), (130) (in slightly diﬀerent notation) was thoroughly inves-

tigated in [31]. It was argued there that the problem greatly simpliﬁes during the Friedmann

regime of expansion when braneworld eﬀects do not contribute signiﬁcantly to cosmic ex-

pansion and can be ignored. This will be discussed in the next subsection.

A. Matter perturbations during the Friedmann regime

Background cosmological evolution during the matter-dominated Friedmann regime is

described by the approximate relations of Sec. III C:

H ≈ H0pΩm (1 + z)3/2 ,

˙H ≈ −

H 2 ,

γ ≈ −

(131)

where Ωm is the cosmological parameter corresponding to pressureless matter. One should

note that the eﬀect of the cosmological constant has been neglected, which is valid while

(1 + z)3 ≫

Ωσ
Ωm ≈ 3.7 .

(132)

Using (131), we can estimate:

ℓH ≈rΩm

Ωℓ

(1 + z)3/2 ≈ 3.3 (1 + z)3/2 .

27

(133)

Obviously, the validity of (132) justiﬁes the early-time Friedmann regime [see condition (64)]

and, therefore, relations (131).

The early-time version of (129), (130), which is valid when z ≫ 1, reads:

(134)

(135)

It was shown in [31] that, deep in the matter-dominated regime, the right-hand side of

(135) can be neglected, and only the homogeneous part of the general solution for Weyl ﬂuid

perturbations in this regime can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the dynamics of matter perturbations

(due to possibly large initial values of δC). On sub-Hubble spatial scales, this solution can

be presented in the form

δC ≈(cid:18)aH

k (cid:19)3/2 F cos

√2k

+ G sin

√2k
aH ! ,

(136)

where constants of integration F and G can be calculated via matching (136) with (120) for

the bulk mode and with (119) for the brane mode at the matter–radiation equality.

Using (136), we can solve (134) and ﬁnd the correction from the bulk mode to the general-

relativistic result ∆m = Ma on sub-Hubble spatial scales:

(137)

where s was deﬁned in (90).

We note here that both the brane mode and bulk mode give contribution to the constants
M, F , and G in (137). (See (78), (79) for a description of brane and bulk modes.) However,
as will be revealed in the following analysis, the contribution of the bulk mode to the
constant M is much smaller than that of the brane mode for all reasonable initial conditions.
The Weyl-ﬂuid perturbation (136) decreases as a−3/4, and the oscillatory perturbation of
pressureless matter [the second term in (137)] as a−5/4. The brane mode ∆(brane)
= Ma in
(137) is thus dominating in the full solution for pressureless matter perturbations at early

m

times. Thus, signiﬁcant deviation from the early-time regime, (136), can be expected only

28

at late times, when the condition H ≫ ℓ−1 ceases to be valid and bulk eﬀects come into play.
Equations (129) and (130) at this period of evolution can be integrated only numerically.

More accurate results for perturbation growth can be obtained by numerically integrating

the exact system of equations, including perturbations of matter, radiation and the Weyl

ﬂuid, starting from the time well before Hubble-radius crossing. This procedure will be

implemented in Sec. VI. Of special interest will be the comparison of our results with the

quasi-static approximation proposed by Koyama and Maartens [24] and discussed in the

next subsection.

B. The Quasi-static approximation

In the quasi-static approximation, time derivatives of perturbations in the Weyl ﬂuid are

assumed to be much smaller than spatial gradients (on sub-Hubble scales) and are neglected

[this reduces (39) to (38)]. Under this condition, Eq. (130) reduces to

δC ≈ −

3ρm(1 + 3γ)
4ρr(2 + 3γ)

∆m ,

which results in a closed equation for ∆m in (129), namely

¨∆m + 2H ˙∆m ≈

ρm∆m

2m2 (cid:18)1 +

3µ(cid:19) .

(138)

(139)

Here, we have introduced a new parameter µ to put this equation in the form in which it is

presented in [24]:

µ ≡ 1 + ℓH 1 +

˙H

3H 2! = −

(140)

The evolution of the gravitational potentials in the quasi-static approximation can be

Note that, in the quasi-static approximation, one obtains a closed second-order diﬀerential

equation (139) for matter perturbation which does not depend on the spatial scale explicitly

[see (129) and (130) for comparison], although the initial conditions can be scale-dependent.

29

From (141) and (142) it is evident that, under the quasi-static approximation, (Ψ − Φ)/Ψ
and Φ/Ψ are also scale independent,

(143)

The quasi-static approximation implies that only the brane mode is signiﬁcant for mat-

ter perturbations at late times, while the contribution from the bulk mode appears to be

negligibly small. This result is consistent with the considerations of Secs. IV C and V A,

where we have seen that the bulk mode rapidly decays after the Hubble-radius crossing.

Numerical integration of the exact system of equations also conﬁrms the convergence to the

quasi-static approximation, as will be demonstrated in Sec. VI.

VI. RESULTS OF NUMERICAL INTEGRATION

In Sec. III A, we derived a closed system of equation for perturbations of a multi-

component ﬂuid on the brane. These equations can be numerically integrated, and one

can obtain the joint evolution of perturbations of pressureless matter, radiation and the

Weyl ﬂuid.11

Equations describing perturbations of matter and radiation densities can be derived from

11 In this paper, we treat the pressureless matter as a single component, neglecting all eﬀects speciﬁc to

baryonic matter.

30

The parameters H, β and γ are determined by the background cosmological equations

(15)–(18), in which pressureless matter density ρm and radiation density ρr are expressed in

terms of Ωm and Ωr respectively.

The system of equations (144)–(149) can be numerically integrated from an early epoch
when the relevant mode was in the super-Hubble regime k ≪ aH. The initial behavior of
mode functions during this period was derived in Sec. IV B [see (96), (97), (102) and (107)],

and is speciﬁed by two initial amplitudes δm(i) = δr(i), δC(i) with power spectra (75) and (77),

respectively.

After the integration of equations (144)–(149), one determines the gravitational potentials

by using the general relations (54) and (55), which become, respectively:

In ﬁgure 2, we present the results of our numerical integration for late-time perturbations

of pressureless matter for the brane mode and for the bulk modes with two amplitudes of

the power spectrum. For simplicity, we choose the scale-invariant initial power spectrum

for the Weyl ﬂuid perturbation, i.e., we set α = 0 in (77), while numerically calculating the

bulk mode. One can see that, even for an extremely high initial perturbations of δC, the

late-time perturbations of matter are dominated by the brane mode. As long as the ﬁrst

condition in (126) is satisﬁed, the bulk-mode contribution will be insigniﬁcant compared to

that of the brane mode. [See (78) and (79) for a description of brane and bulk modes.]

Concentrating then on the brane mode, we ﬁnd that late-time perturbations of matter

follow quite well the quasi-static approximation due to Koyama and Maartens, described

in Sec. V B by equation (139). This behavior is illustrated in ﬁgure 3 for the wave-number
s = 2π· 400 ≃ 2500, which corresponds to the spatial scale of 10 Mpc. This ﬁgure shows: (i)
the growth of perturbations on the brane can diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those in ΛCDM. (ii)

Perturbations on the brane with wavelength of 10 Mpc match the quasi-static approximation

quite well. As one increases Ωℓ, perturbations on the brane show greater departure from

those in ΛCDM. This is illustrated in ﬁgure 4 for the single spatial scale of 10 Mpc. This

dependency on Ωℓ provides a potent observational test for the braneworld. (Note that in the
limit Ωℓ → 0, the braneworld reduces to ΛCDM). The diﬀerence between the braneworld
and ΛCDM is shown in ﬁgure 5 for various scales. One ﬁnds that the ratio ∆m/∆ΛCDM

FIG. 2. Density perturbations on the brane are shown for three cases: (i) Topmost (red) line shows

the evolution of matter density perturbations when perturbations in the Weyl ﬂuid are initially

absent (the brane mode). (ii) The middle (blue) line shows matter density perturbations when

initial perturbations in matter are absent but perturbations in the Weyl ﬂuid are present (the bulk

mode). (iii) The lower (green) curve is the same as (ii) but with a suppressed initial amplitude

for perturbations in the Weyl ﬂuid. In all three cases, ∆m ∝ a(t) during the matter-dominated
epoch. Here, the constant c is deﬁned in (79). One can see that, even for extremely large initial

perturbations of the Weyl ﬂuid (with c = 106), the brane mode dominates during the late-time

evolution. For numerical illustration, we have chosen Ωℓ = 0.025 and s = 2π·400 which corresponds
to ∼ 10 Mpc scale. [See (78) and (79) for a description of brane and bulk modes.]
increases very slowly for smaller scales (higher values of s) and saturates for s >

∼ 100, which
includes the range of scales of interest, given in (91). This indicates the self-similarity of

∆m for these scales. Note that under the quasi-static approximation, the ratio ∆m/∆ΛCDM

m

does not depend upon spatial scale, as Eq. (139) diﬀers from the corresponding equation

of ΛCDM only by a scale-independent factor [1 + 1/(3µ)]. Hence, in view of ﬁgure 5, one

can conclude that the quasi-static approximation is most accurate on smaller spatial scales

while being less accurate on very large spatial scales (s < 100). This conclusion is explicitly

evident from ﬁgure 6, where the accuracy of the quasi-static approximation is shown12 as

12 In ﬁgure 6, we calculate ∆m and ∆qs

m with the same initial conditions, ∆m = a/a0 and ˙∆m = ˙a/a0, while

starting from a/a0 = 0.001. Furthermore, we calculate ∆m using the system of equations (129) and (130)

valid during matter domination.

FIG. 3. Perturbations on the brane obtained using the exact system of equations (solid red) are

perturbations is highlighted.

the manifestation of the fact that, on smaller spatial scales (higher k or s), the derivatives

of δC are more strongly suppressed in (130).

From (120) and (136) it is clear that the Weyl ﬂuid perturbation, δC, in the bulk mode,

will oscillate with decaying amplitude inside the horizon, and that this will remain true for

any initial δC(i). During the matter domination epoch, δC (in both brane and bulk modes)

grows due to the back reaction from ∆m in (130), but this eﬀect is expected to be signiﬁcant

only at late times when ∆m has grown suﬃciently. However the growth in δC is slow enough

to satisfy the quasi-static approximation (138), as shown in ﬁgure 7 for the brane mode.

Note that the small oscillations in δC, shown in ﬁgure 7, are triggered by the back reaction

from sub-horizon scale oscillating perturbations in radiation, ∆r, during the radiative epoch,

see (119).

The corresponding evolution of the gravitational potential Ψ is shown in ﬁgure 8(a), and
that of the relative diﬀerence (Ψ − Φ)/Ψ in ﬁgure 8(b). Figure 9(a) shows the evolution of
(Ψ−Φ)/Ψ for diﬀerent values of Ωℓ, whereas ﬁgure 9(b) shows the present value of (Ψ−Φ)/Ψ
as a function of Ωℓ for diﬀerent values of the wavenumber s ≡ k/a0H0. The corresponding

FIG. 4. Density perturbations on the brane are very sensitive to the value of the brane parameter

Ωℓ, which depends on the ratio of the ﬁve- and four-dimensional gravitational couplings, see (4)

and (14). At late times, perturbations on the brane grow more rapidly than in ΛCDM (dotted

blue line). The above results correspond to the scale s ≡ k/a0H0 ≃ 2500. Unlike perturbations in
ΛCDM, perturbations on the brane are very weakly scale dependent. This is illustrated in ﬁgure

5, in which Ωℓ is held ﬁxed while s is allowed to vary, and in ﬁgure 6, in which both s and Ωℓ are

varied.

results for the ratio Φ/Ψ are shown in ﬁgure 10. These ﬁgures clearly demonstrate the

following features of our model:

1. The potentials Φ and Ψ depart from the ΛCDM behaviour, Φ = Ψ, at late times.

2. The departure from ΛCDM is more pronounced for larger values of the parameter

Ωℓ, which is deﬁned by (4) and (14) and which depends on the ratio of the ﬁve- and

four-dimensional gravitational couplings.

the quasi-static approximation becomes less accurate, consistent with ﬁgures 5 and 6.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

39

We have investigated the evolution of perturbations on the normal branch of the induced

gravity braneworld, in which the brane is embedded in a ﬂat bulk space-time. Of special

interest to us was the behavior of the bulk mode of perturbations, which is characterized by

non-zero (and possibly quite large) initial amplitude of eﬀective Weyl ﬂuid perturbations.

Our approach to the problem, which is described in Sec. III, goes beyond the quasi-static

approximation and allows one to study the behavior of perturbations starting from deep

within the radiation-dominated epoch, where the corresponding modes are super-Hubble.

In Sec. IV B, we established that perturbations of the Weyl ﬂuid and those of matter per-

turbations depend very weakly on time in the super-Hubble regime. This allows one to

set initial conditions during this early cosmological epoch, as described in Sec. IV A. We

consider the initial perturbations of matter and of the Weyl ﬂuid as being statistically in-

dependent. In this case, the initial conditions describe two natural modes, which we refer

to as the ‘brane mode’ and the ‘bulk mode’, depending upon which perturbation vanishes

initially.

In Sec. IV C, we established that Weyl-ﬂuid perturbations decrease with time in the bulk

mode while growing in the brane mode, after Hubble crossing during radiation domination.

At the same time, perturbations of radiation, as well as those of the gravitational potentials
Φ and Ψ, demonstrate general-relativistic behavior, Φ ≃ Ψ, in this regime.

At the beginning of the matter-dominated epoch, the contribution from the bulk mode

continues to decrease, as argued in Sec. V A. This explains the validity of the quasi-static

approximation described in Sec. V B.

All our results are conﬁrmed by numerical integration of the exact system of equations

for pressureless matter, radiation and the Weyl ﬂuid, which is performed in Sec. VI. They

are also in good agreement with the ﬁve-dimensional numerical simulations of [30].

Our main conclusion is that the presence of oscillatory terms in the evolution of pertur-

bations (like those described by equation (137)) are not likely to be of any signiﬁcance, and

the main eﬀects of the braneworld ansatz would be the almost self-similar (Ωℓ -dependent)

smooth deviation from general-relativistic behavior, shown in ﬁgures 4, 8(a), 8(b), 9(a).

Our main results are summarized below.

1. Perturbations on the brane grow more rapidly than in ΛCDM at late times. This was

40

illustrated in ﬁgure 4. Departure from ΛCDM is more pronounced for larger values

of the parameter Ωℓ, which is deﬁned in (4) and (14) and which depends on the ratio

of the ﬁve- and four-dimensional gravitational couplings. (Note that the braneworld
model under consideration passes to ΛCDM in the limit Ωℓ → 0.)

2. Departure from ΛCDM is also reﬂected in the behaviour of the potentials Φ and Ψ

which follow the ΛCDM asymptote, Φ = Ψ, only at early times. At late times,
corresponding to z <
∼ 50, the diﬀerence between Φ and Ψ becomes pronounced, and

this eﬀect is larger for larger values of Ωℓ.

3. The evolution of density perturbations and of the potentials Φ and Ψ displays a very

weak dependence on length scale. This was illustrated in ﬁgures 5 and 6 for the
density contrast ∆m, and in ﬁgures 9(b) and 10(b) for the ratios (Ψ− Φ)/Ψ and Φ/Ψ,
respectively. These ﬁgures illustrate that our results for ∆m, Φ and Ψ converge to those
>
of the quasi-static approximation for larger values of the wavenumber s ≡ k/a0H0
∼
100, which encompass the scales relevant for the large-scale structure formation, given

in (91).

The results of this work will be compared with observations in a companion paper.
