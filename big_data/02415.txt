A trio of horseshoes: past, present and future dynamical
evolution of Earth co-orbital asteroids 2015 XX169,
2015 YA and 2015 YQ1

C. de la Fuente Marcos • R. de la Fuente Marcos

Abstract It is widely accepted that a quasi-steady-
state ﬂux of minor bodies moving in and out of the
co-orbital state with the Earth may exist. Some of
these objects are very good candidates for future in situ
study due to their favourable dynamical properties. In
this paper, we show that the recently discovered near-
Earth asteroids 2015 XX169, 2015 YA and 2015 YQ1
are small transient Earth co-orbitals. These new ﬁnd-
ings increase the tally of known Earth co-orbitals to
17. The three of them currently exhibit asymmetric
horseshoe behaviour subjected to a Kozai resonance
and their short-term orbital evolution is rather unsta-
ble. Both 2015 YA and 2015 YQ1 may leave Earth’s
co-orbital zone in the near future as they experience
close encounters with Venus, the Earth-Moon system
and Mars. Asteroid 2015 XX169 may have remained
in the vicinity of, or trapped inside, the 1:1 mean mo-
tion resonance with our planet for many thousands of
years and may continue in that region for a signiﬁcant
amount of time into the future.

1 Introduction

During the last two decades, observations of near-Earth
Objects (NEOs) have uncovered the existence of a tran-
sient near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population that goes
around the Sun in almost exactly one Earth’s orbital

period, i.e., they are trapped in the 1:1 mean motion
resonance with our planet. Although their orbits may
not be at all similar to that of the Earth if they are
very eccentric and inclined, these peculiar NEAs are
still referred to in the literature as Earth co-orbitals
(Morais & Morbidelli 2002). Some of these NEAs may
have had their origin in the Earth-Moon system (see,
e.g., Margot & Nicholson 2003) although other sources
in the main asteroid belt are perhaps more likely (see,
e.g., Morais & Morbidelli 2002). However, the eﬀects
derived from orbital chaos severely limit our ability to
determine their sources in a reliable manner (Connors
et al. 2004).

It is widely accepted that a quasi-steady-state ﬂux of
minor bodies moving in and out of the co-orbital state
with the Earth may exist (see, e.g., Morais & Morbidelli
2002). The list of documented Earth co-orbitals now in-
cludes 14 objects (see, e.g., de la Fuente Marcos & de
la Fuente Marcos 2016). Most of these minor bodies
have diameters smaller than 50 m (which is equivalent
to an absolute magnitude, H, in the range 23.5–25.5
for an assumed albedo in the range 0.20–0.04). Some
of these NEOs are relatively easy to access from our
planet, experiencing close ﬂybys (i.e., have short perigee
distances), and as such they have been included in the
Near-Earth Object Human Space Flight Accessible Tar-
gets Study (NHATS)1 list (Abell et al. 2012a,b). The
actual size of this interesting population could be large
because small bodies probably dominate this dynamical
class.

Unfortunately and for NEOs, being small is usually
associated with not getting much attention. A large
number of NEO candidates listed on the Minor Planet
Center’s (MPC) NEO Conﬁrmation Page2 attract no

follow up if their preliminary orbital data indicate that
they are probably very small. Follow-up observers se-
lect targets that their telescope can observe, and often
small objects have a very limited window of observabil-
ity, thus do not get observed as much as larger objects.
It is frequently the case that such small objects do not
accumulate enough observations even to be formally
considered discovered and consequently they do not get
a designation at all. Therefore, they become lost aster-
oids at discovery time. Even for those that have been
oﬃcially discovered (i.e., received a designation), be-
ing small almost certainly implies that their orbits will
remain poorly determined for decades. For instance,
the number of recovered objects with H > 25.5 mag in
the extensive study performed by Harris & D’Abramo
(2015) is zero and only for objects with H < 20 mag
the recovery probability (that of observing the object
again some period, often a year, after discovery and,
consequently, improve its orbital solution) was found
to be greater than 50%. On the other hand, recovering
a small NEO not only depends on its apparent magni-
tude at perigee —that must be < 22 in V for most ac-
tive surveys— but on its rate of motion as well because
of image trailing loss of very small, fast moving bodies.
For example, a NEO travelling faster than 10◦per day
must reach an apparent magnitude at perigee < 20 in
order to be detected (see ﬁg. 1 in Harris & D’Abramo
2015). The faintest asteroid observation performed so
far corresponded to V = 26.7 mag for asteroid 2008 LG2
(Micheli et al. 2015), but it was accomplished by us-
ing targeted follow-up with the telescope tracking rate
matching closely the asteroid’s angular motion in the
sky. Currently active and past NEO search programs do
not have the ability to go as faint as V ∼ 25 mag in sur-
vey mode (Farnocchia et al. 2016). This means in prac-
tice that most recoveries of small NEOs are serendipi-
tous rather than planned.

Given the observational challenges pointed out
above, many small Earth co-orbitals may get lost soon
after being discovered and the ones receiving an oﬃcial
designation are strong candidates to join the group of
asteroids with poorly determined orbits waiting for an
uncertain recovery. This state of aﬀairs has a neg-
ative impact on our understanding of how a quasi-
steady-state ﬂux of minor bodies moving in and out
of the co-orbital state with the Earth may operate.
Here, we show that the recently discovered small NEAs
2015 XX169, 2015 YA and 2015 YQ1 are performing the
corkscrew motion characteristic of Earth co-orbitals of
the horseshoe type. With these three discoveries the
number of known Earth co-orbitals increases to 17 with
12 of them following some kind of horseshoe path with
respect to our planet. Many of them are subjected to a

Kozai resonance (Kozai 1962). This paper is organized
as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the methodology fol-
lowed in this work. In Sect. 3, we present the available
data on 2015 XX169 and study its dynamical evolution
as well as the impact of errors on our results. Sections
4 and 5 are equivalent to Sect. 3 but for 2015 YA
and 2015 YQ1, respectively.
In Sect. 6, we discuss
the comparative dynamics of these objects and place
them within the context of the previously known Earth
co-orbitals. Our conclusions are presented in Sect. 7.

2 Earth co-orbitals: what are they and how to

study them

Members of the population of NEAs in co-orbital mo-
tion with our planet are not characterised as such at
discovery time but identiﬁed a posteriori during the
analysis of their past, present and future orbital evo-
lution that is explored using N -body simulations.

2.1 Characterising co-orbital objects

Co-orbital objects (asteroids or comets) move inside the
1:1 mean motion resonance with a planet. As such, they
go around a certain star —e.g., the Sun in the case of
the Earth— in almost exactly one orbital period of their
host planet.
In contrast with natural satellites, they
do not follow closed planetocentric paths but from the
planet’s point of view they loop around, in some cases
for billions of years.

Co-orbital bodies are identiﬁed numerically by study-
ing the behaviour of their relative mean longitude, λr,
or diﬀerence between the mean longitude of the ob-
ject and that of its host planet. The relative mean
longitude of a passing body with respect to a given
planet can take any value in the interval (0, 360)◦, i.e.
circulates; in sharp contrast, the relative mean longi-
tude of co-orbital bodies librates or oscillates around
a certain value (in principle, 0◦, ±60◦or 180◦, but the
actual value depends on the orbital eccentricity and in-
clination). The mean longitude of an object —planet,
asteroid or comet— is given by λ = M + Ω + ω, where
M is the mean anomaly, Ω is the longitude of the as-
cending node, and ω is the argument of perihelion (see,
e.g., Murray & Dermott 1999).

The degree of complexity of the co-orbital dynam-
ics experienced by an object in a multi-planet environ-
ment could be very high. In addition to the three el-
ementary conﬁgurations —quasi-satellite or retrograde
satellite, Trojan or tadpole, and horseshoe— compound
states (see, e.g., Morais & Morbidelli 2002) as well as
recurrent transitions between the various conﬁgurations

(Namouni et al. 1999; Namouni & Murray 2000) are
possible.
In the Solar System and focusing on long-
term stability, the most likely conﬁguration is by far the
Trojan state that —for low values of both eccentricity
and inclination— is characterised by the libration of
λr around ±60◦ as the aﬀected minor body follows a
tadpole orbit with respect to the host planet (see, e.g.,
Murray & Dermott 1999); such an object is classiﬁed
as an L4 Trojan when the value of λr oscillates around
+60◦, or as an L5 Trojan if the value librates around
−60◦ (or 300◦). For eccentric orbits, the values of λr
are displaced towards 180◦by an amount proportional
to the orbital eccentricity (Namouni 1999; Namouni et
al. 1999; Namouni & Murray 2000; Nesvorny et al.
2002; Morais & Morbidelli 2002). If instead of stability
we are more concerned about plain likelihood, then the
most probable co-orbital state is the one characterised
by a libration amplitude larger than 180◦around a value
of λr = 180◦ and often enclosing ±60◦; such objects
follow horseshoe orbits (see, e.g., Murray & Dermott
1999). At regular intervals and before moving away,
a horseshoe librator follows a corkscrew-like trajectory
in the vicinity of its host planet for a certain period of
time, a decade or more in the case of the Earth (see, e.g.,
de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos 2016). Far
less likely than the horseshoe conﬁguration, the quasi-
satellite dynamical state was ﬁrst described by Jack-
son (1913).
In this case, the object involved appears
to travel around the planet but is not gravitationally
bound to it: the body librates around the longitude of
its associated planet —i.e., λr oscillates around 0◦—
but its trajectory is not closed (see, e.g., Mikkola et al.
2006).

2.2 Numerical investigation

As pointed out above, co-orbital objects are identiﬁed
indirectly after investigating numerically the evolution
of their relative mean longitude with respect to a given
planet. In this work and following de la Fuente Marcos

& de la Fuente Marcos (2012), we perform extensive di-
rect N -body calculations using the Hermite scheme de-
scribed by Makino (1991) and implemented by Aarseth
(2003). The standard version of this direct N -body
code is publicly available from the IoA web site.3 Ini-
tial conditions (positions and velocities in the barycen-
tre of the Solar System) have been obtained from the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) HORIZONS system
(Giorgini et al. 1996; Standish 1998) and they are re-
ferred to the epoch JD 2457400.5 (2016-January-13.0),
which is the t = 0 instant in our ﬁgures. Our calcu-
lations take into account perturbations from the eight
major planets, the Moon, the barycentre of the Pluto-
Charon system, and the three largest asteroids. Non-
gravitational forces, relativistic and oblateness terms
were not included in the calculations.

The current orbital solutions of the three small NEAs
—2015 XX169, 2015 YA and 2015 YQ1— studied here
are relatively poor (see Table 1) as they are based on
short arcs but their degrees of uncertainty are simi-
lar to that of the recently identiﬁed Earth co-orbital
2015 SO2 (de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos
2016). In such cases, a statistical approach can be used
to evaluate the current dynamical state of the minor
body probabilistically. In order to do that and in ad-
dition to making use of the nominal orbit in Table 1,
we have computed 50 control simulations for ±50 kyr
for each object with sets of orbital elements obtained
from the nominal ones within the quoted uncertainties
and assuming Gaussian distributions for them up to
±9σ. For instance, a new value of the semi-major axis
for a control orbit has been found using the expression
at = hai + n σa ri, where at is the semi-major axis of
the test orbit, hai is the mean value of the semi-major
axis from the available orbit (Table 1), n is a suitable
integer (in our case, 9), σa is the standard deviation of
a (Table 1), and ri is a (pseudo) random number with

4

normal distribution in the range −1 to 1. In the ﬁgures
when an orbit is labelled ‘±nσ’, where n is an integer, it
has been obtained by adding (+) or subtracting (−) n-
times the uncertainty from the orbital parameters (the
six elements) in Table 1. In addition, we have computed
two sets of 100 shorter control simulations in both di-
rections of time and analysed the short-term evolution
of the orbital elements a, e, i, Ω and ω for each object
studied here (within 1σ and 9σ, respectively) focusing
on the average values and the ranges (minimum and
maximum) of the parameters.

Sitarski (1998, 1999, 2006) has pointed out that the
procedure used above is equivalent to considering a
number of diﬀerent virtual objects moving in similar
orbits, but not a sample of test orbits derived from
a set of observations obtained for a single object.
In
other words, given a set of observations of a certain ob-
ject, the values of the computed orbital elements are
not mutually independent. The correct statistical al-
ternative is to consider how the elements aﬀect each
other, applying the Monte Carlo using the Covariance
Matrix (MCCM) approach (Bordovitsyna et al. 2001;
Avdyushev & Banschikova 2007), or to follow the pro-
cedure described in Sitarski (1998, 1999, 2006). As a
consistency test, we have used the implementation of
the MCCM approach described in de la Fuente Mar-
cos & de la Fuente Marcos (2015b) to recompute the
orbital evolution of the objects studied producing an
additional set of 100 short control simulations similar
to the other two pointed out above. The respective
covariance matrices have been obtained from the JPL
Small-Body Database.

The study of the past, present and future evolution
of hundreds of control orbits for each object using both
classical and MCCM techniques conﬁrms the robust-
ness of the objects’ current resonant state as derived
from our calculations and the relatively poor orbits
available. Based on the number of computations per-
formed, we can state that 2015 XX169, 2015 YA and
2015 YQ1 are current co-orbitals of the Earth with a
probability > 99.8%. However, all of them exhibit a
rather unstable orbital evolution and two of them may
not remain within Earth’s co-orbital region for long.
The time-scale for exponential divergence of initially
close orbits or Lyapunov time of these objects is in some
cases as short as a few decades.

3 Asteroid 2015 XX169: data and results

Asteroid 2015 XX169 was discovered on 2015 December
9 by R. G. Matheny observing for the Mt. Lemmon Sur-
vey with the 1.5-m reﬂector of the programme (Steck-
lum et al. 2015). It was ﬁrst observed at V = 20.9 mag

and the collected data showed that it is a very small ob-
ject with an absolute magnitude, H, of 27.4; if a value
of the albedo in the range 0.20–0.04 is assumed, this
absolute magnitude is equivalent to a diameter in the
range 9–22 m. It has an Earth Minimum Orbit Inter-
section Distance (MOID) of 0.015 AU and it has been
included in the NHATS list. Its orbit is in need of fur-
ther observations as it is currently based on 37 data
points acquired during 4 d (see Table 1). Although this
object is a typical example of the problematic situation
described above, small object with relatively few obser-
vations, we will show that in this case it is still possible
to arrive to statistically robust conclusions regarding
its current dynamical state using the available orbit.

At present, 2015 XX169 belongs to the Aten dynam-
ical class and moves in an orbit with a value of the
semi-major axis of 0.99974 AU, similar to that of our
planet (1.00074 AU), eccentricity of 0.18364, and mod-
erate inclination, i = 7.◦7. The values of the Heliocentric
Keplerian osculating orbital elements and their uncer-
tainties in Table 1 (as provided by the JPL Small-Body
Database4) are referred to the epoch JD2457400.5, i.e.
a time after its discovery and subsequent close en-
counter with our planet on 2015 December 14. As a
result of this event, the value of the semi-major axis of
2015 XX169 is slowly drifting upwards and the asteroid
will become an Apollo asteroid within less than a year
from now (see Fig. 1). After that, the value of the
semi-major axis of the asteroid will remain in the range
1.002 AU to 1.006 AU for over 130 years to decrease
again after the next close encounter with our planet,
returning to the Aten dynamical class.

The immediate, past and future, orbital evolution of
2015 XX169 is displayed in Fig. 1. All the control orbits
exhibit consistent behaviour within a few hundred years
of t = 0. Its Lyapunov time was longer in the past, but
now it is just a few hundred years. Figure 2, left-hand
and central panels, shows that this object was consid-
erably more stable in the past and that its recent close
encounter with the Earth has made the orbit signiﬁ-
cantly less stable although 2015 XX169 is not expected
to leave the vicinity of Earth’s co-orbital zone within
tens of thousands of years (see below); based on the in-
tegrations performed, the Earth’s co-orbital region cur-
rently extends from ∼ 0.994 AU to ∼ 1.006 AU. Consis-
tent with the warning conveyed in Sitarski (1998, 1999,
2006), the average, short-term evolution of the path fol-
lowed by 2015 XX169 as derived using the MCCM ap-
proach (see Fig. 2, right-hand panels) is rather diﬀerent
—and more chaotic into the past— than the one ob-
tained when the classical method is applied. It is clear

4http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi

that the average evolution from the MCCM approach
is more in line with that of the nominal orbit plotted
in Fig. 1. In any case, consistent dynamical evolution
is systematically found within reasonable limits (a few
hundred years of t = 0) for all the control orbits stud-
ied.

Asteroid 2015 XX169 follows an asymmetrical horse-
shoe trajectory with respect to the Earth; λr librates
around 180◦, but enclosing 0◦(see Fig. 1, panel C). The
value of λr does not behave as expected of a classical
horseshoe librator, where ±60◦ are enclosed by the tra-
jectory but not 0◦(see, e.g., Murray & Dermott 1999).
The object switches between the Aten and Apollo dy-
namical classes at regular intervals of about 100 yrs
(see Fig. 1, panel D) and it will cease these transitions
in about 500 yrs from now, remaining as an Aten. The

value of the Kozai parameter —√1 − e2 cos i— remains

approximately constant (see Fig. 1, panel B) over the
displayed time interval as the value of the eccentricity
increases (see Fig. 1, panel E) and, conversely, that
of the inclination decreases (see Fig. 1, panel F). The
value of the argument of perihelion remains conﬁned
in the range (-100, -50)◦(see Fig. 1, panel G) which is
consistent with a Kozai resonance with libration around
-90◦(or 270◦), although not very strong. At present, the
descending node is close to Earth’s aphelion and the as-
cending node is away from the path of any planet (see
Fig. 1, panel H). The distance between the Sun and
the nodes for a prograde orbit is given by

(1)

r = a(1 − e2)/(1 ± e cos ω) ,
where the ”+” sign is for the ascending node (where the
orbit crosses the Ecliptic from South to North) and the
”−” sign is for the descending node. Close encounters
are only possible with the Earth and at the descending
node; this is the conﬁguration that the object reached
on 2015 December 14 during its last approach to our
planet.

Representative longer integrations are displayed in
Fig. 3. Asteroid 2015 XX169 may remain as co-orbital
of our planet for many thousands of years into the fu-
ture and may have remained as such for an equally long
period of time, or even longer, in the past. In many cal-
culations (see left-hand and right-hand C panels in Fig.
3), multiple instances of back and forth transitions be-
tween the horseshoe and quasi-satellite resonant states
are observed. These transitions are similar to those
that characterise the orbital evolution of 2015 SO2 as
described in de la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Mar-
cos (2016). The mechanism behind these transitions is
analogous to the one driving the dynamics of 2015 SO2.
When this behaviour is observed, the object exhibits
Kozai-like dynamics with its nodes conﬁned between

Earth’s aphelion and perihelion (see panel H in Fig. 3).
In general, any abrupt changes in the state of motion
of this object are the result of relatively close encoun-
ters with our planet at distances close to one Hill radius
(0.0098 AU). During most of the simulated time, both
eccentricity and inclination oscillate with the same fre-
quency but out of phase (see Fig. 3, panels E and F),
however the libration is far from regular which suggests
that the Kozai resonance is not particularly strong.
Consistently, the value of the Kozai parameter (see Fig.
3, panel B) exhibits irregular oscillations and the argu-
ment of perihelion undergoes phases of obvious libra-
tion (see Fig. 3, panel G). Some stages in the orbital
evolution of this object are similar to those observed
for 2015 SO2 as described in de la Fuente Marcos &
de la Fuente Marcos (2016). The object exhibits inter-
mitent Kozai-like behaviour throughout the entire time
interval with its nodes often conﬁned between Earth’s
aphelion and perihelion.

4 Asteroid 2015 YA: data and results

Asteroid 2015 YA was discovered on 2015 December
16 by G. J. Leonard and R. G. Matheny observing
for the Catalina Sky Survey (Buzzi et al. 2015) at
V = 17.2 mag. It is as large as 2015 XX169 and as such
it shares the same problem: small object with relatively
few observations.
Its current orbital solution is less
than satisfactory with 47 observations acquired during

7 d (see Table 1), but its uncertainties are similar to
those of 2015 XX169 or 2015 SO2 (de la Fuente Marcos
& de la Fuente Marcos 2016). Its orbital elements show
that its path is more eccentric (e = 0.27914) and less
inclined (i = 1.◦6) than that of 2015 XX169. This opens
the possibility of closer encounters with the Earth —its
MOID with our planet has a value of 0.0036 AU— and
even relatively close approaches to both Venus (at per-
ihelion) and Mars (at aphelion). Evolving within this
dynamical context, 2015 YA must be less stable than
2015 XX169.
It is however a member of the NHATS
list, NASA’s list of viable NEAs for an actual human
exploration mission.

This asteroid is currently a member of the Aten dy-
namical class but before its recent encounter with the
Earth on 2015 December 15 it was an Apollo. It will re-
main as an Aten for the next 142 years and then return
to the Apollo dynamical class. Its short-term dynami-
cal evolution is displayed in Fig. 4 (nominal orbit). It
arrived very recently to the Earth co-orbital zone and it
may leave in a few hundred years. Its orbital evolution
is far more chaotic than that of 2015 XX169. As in the
previous case, the object follows an asymmetric horse-
shoe path with respect to the Earth with the value of
the relative mean longitude librating around 180◦, but
enclosing 0◦(see Fig. 4, panel C). The short-term evo-
lution of the value of its semi-major axis is rather irreg-
ular (see Fig. 4, panel D) although it switched between
the Apollo and Aten dynamical classes very recently
and it will switch back to Apollo in the future. The

value of the Kozai parameter changes signiﬁcantly over
the time interval plotted (see Fig. 4, panel B). The be-
haviour of eccentricity (see Fig. 4, panel E), inclination
(see Fig. 4, panel F) and argument of perihelion (see
Fig. 4, panel G) is far from what is expected when a
Kozai resonance is in operation. The descending node
is close to Earth’s perihelion, not aphelion as in the case
of 2015 XX169, and the ascending node is away from the
path of any planet (see Fig. 4, panel H). However, this
situation will be inverted in about 300 yrs from now.

The analysis of the eﬀect of the errors in Table 1 on
the evolution of the orbital parameters displayed in Fig.
5 shows that the value of its Lyapunov time was very
short —below 100 yr— in the past and it will be only
slightly longer in the future (a few hundred years). In
this case, the average short-term orbital evolution pre-
dicted by the classical method (left-hand panels in Fig.
5) is consistent with that from the MCCM approach
(right-hand panels in Fig. 5).

The past long-term evolution of 2015 YA strongly
suggests that its semi-major axis started to reach values
similar to that of our planet nearly 30 kyr ago (see
Fig. 6). It also includes phases in which the behaviour
of the argument of perihelion is consistent with what
is expected when a Kozai resonance is in eﬀect (see
Fig. 6, panel G) but the evolution of the eccentricity
(see Fig. 6, panel E) does not exhibit the oscillatory
behaviour that is observed, for instance, in the case
of 2015 XX169. The positions of the nodes oscillate
more or less regularly (see Fig. 6, panel H) and the
closest encounters with our planet often coincide with
the time when both nodes are in the path of the Earth.
The dynamics of this object is currently controlled by

encounters with Venus and the Earth-Moon system, but
Mars may also be an important perturber in the future.

5 Asteroid 2015 YQ1: data and results

Asteroid 2015 YQ1 was discovered on 2015 December
19 by A. D. Grauer observing for the Mt. Lemmon
Survey (Bacci et al. 2015) at V = 20.1 mag. As the
previous two objects, its orbital solution is in need of
some improvement as it is currently based on 64 ob-
servations obtained during a time span of 3 d.
It is
the smallest of the trio of objects studied here with H
= 28.1 mag, which translates into a diameter in the
range 7–16 m for an assumed albedo of 0.20–0.04. Its
orbit is also the most eccentric (e = 0.40398) of the
set but its inclination is similar to that of 2015 YA
(i = 2.◦5). With these values of the orbital parameters
it may be the most unstable of the trio. It currently
belongs to the Apollo dynamical class. The value of its
Earth MOID is 0.00052 AU and this NEA experienced
a close encounter with our planet on 2015 December
22 at 0.0037 AU. It undergoes close encounters with
Venus, the Earth-Moon system, and Mars at regular
intervals. Like the previous two, it has been included
in the NHATS list. Once more we have a dynamically
interesting small object with few observations; another
obvious case of the situation described in the introduc-
tion section.

The immediate, past and future, orbital evolution of
2015 YQ1 is displayed in Fig. 7; it follows an asymmet-
rical horseshoe trajectory with respect to the Earth like

9

Fig. 6 Same as Fig. 3 but for 2015 YA. Venus’, Earth’s and Mars’ aphelion and perihelion distances are also shown in

the other two as λr librates around 180◦but enclosing
0◦(see Fig. 7, panel C). The object switches between
the Aten and Apollo dynamical classes but the evolu-
tion of its semi-major axis is nearly as irregular as that
of 2015 YA (see Fig. 7, panel D) although the transi-
tions will last longer than in the case of 2015 YA. The
value of the Kozai parameter varies more than that of
2015 YA (compare Figs. 4 and 7, panel B) over the
displayed time interval. Both eccentricity (see Fig. 7,
panel E) and inclination (see Fig. 7, panel F) tend to
increase over time, although the eccentricity decreases
after 1200 yrs into the future. The value of the argu-
ment of perihelion remains conﬁned to the range (90,
175)◦(see Fig. 7, panel G) which is somewhat consis-
tent with a Kozai resonance at high eccentricity, al-
though not very strong. At present, the ascending node
is close to Earth’s perihelion and the descending node
is in the path of Venus (see Fig. 7, panel H). Figure 8
shows that 2015 YQ1 is probably the most dynamically
unstable of the objects studied here. The data sug-
gest that the value of its Lyapunov time is very short,
perhaps as low as a few decades, both for its past and
future orbital evolution. The average short-term orbital
evolution predicted by the classical method (left-hand
panels in Fig. 8) is somewhat consistent with that from
the MCCM approach (right-hand panels in Fig. 8) but
its dynamical behaviour is diﬃcult to predict beyond a
century or so.

The past and future long-term dynamical evolution
of 2015 YQ1 shows (see Fig. 9) that although it does
not go beyond the orbit of Mars, it travels relatively fre-
quently inside that of Venus. As in the case of 2015 YA,
it also experiences phases in which the behaviour of the

argument of perihelion is consistent with the one ex-
pected when a Kozai resonance is in eﬀect (see Fig.
9, panel G) with libration about a value of 180◦, for
example. However, the evolution of both eccentricity
and inclination (see Fig. 9, panels E and F) is rather
irregular and does not exhibit the coupled oscillatory
behaviour that is observed, for instance, in the case of
2015 XX169 (see Fig. 3, panels E and F). The positions
of the nodes oscillate more or less regularly (see Fig.
9, panel H) between 0.5 AU and 1.4 AU (Mars’ peri-
helion). The dynamics of this object is controlled by
close encounters with Venus, the Earth-Moon system,
and Mars.

6 Discussion

The three objects studied here were discovered within
ten days, they are small objects with short data arcs,
and move co-orbital to our planet. However, their orbits
are quite diverse, mainly because of their eccentricities.
As a result, their orbital evolution is also rather diﬀer-
ent. They have similar values of the semi-major axis
and moderate to low inclinations. The Lyapunov time
decreases as the eccentricity increases.

In general, Earth co-orbitals are small, for exam-
ple 2003 YN107, 2002 AA29 or 2001 GO2, but two of
them are rather large —3753 Cruithne (1986 TO) has
H = 15.7 mag (Wiegert et al. 1997, 1998) and 85770
(1998 UP1) has H = 20.5 mag.5 Both are horseshoe li-

brators like the NEAs discussed here. Other NEAs ex-
periencing horseshoe behaviour are 54509 YORP (2000
PH5) (Wiegert et al. 2002; Margot & Nicholson 2003),
2001 GO2 (Wiegert et al. 2002; Margot & Nicholson
2003; Brasser et al. 2004), 2002 AA29 (Connors et
al. 2002; Brasser et al. 2004), 2003 YN107 (Brasser
et al. 2004; Connors et al. 2004), 2010 SO16 (Chris-
tou & Asher 2011), 2013 BS45 (de la Fuente Marcos
& de la Fuente Marcos 2013) and 2015 SO2 (de la
Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos 2016). In con-
trast with what happens with Jupiter where Trojans
dominate,
in the case of the Earth horseshoe libra-
tors outnumber any other co-orbital type with 12 ob-
jects including the three studied here. Other Earth
co-orbitals are 2010 TK7 (Connors et al.
2011), a
Trojan, and four quasi-satellites —164207 (2004 GU9)
(Connors et al.
2006; Wajer
2010), 277810 (2006 FV35) (Wiegert et al. 2008; Wajer
2010), 2013 LX28 (Connors 2014), and 2014 OL339 (de
la Fuente Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos 2014). The
existence of asteroids moving in long-lasting horseshoe
orbits associated with the Earth was ﬁrst predicted by
Hollabaugh and Everhart (1973). All the known Earth
co-orbitals are transient companions to our planet and
most of them will remain as such for less than a few
thousand years. Very likely, the most stable of the cur-
rently known Earth co-orbitals is 2010 SO16 that stays
as horseshoe librator for at least 120 kyr and possi-
bly up to 1 Myr (Christou & Asher 2011), remaining
in the same co-orbital conﬁguration during this time
span. Asteroid 2015 SO2 could be nearly as stable as
2010 SO16, but it switches between co-orbital conﬁgu-
rations on a regular basis (de la Fuente Marcos & de la
Fuente Marcos 2016). Asteroid 2015 XX169 is certainly
less stable than 2015 SO2, but more stable than many
of the objects listed above. Although co-orbitals are
often considered as mere dynamical curiosities, some of
them are relatively easy to access from our planet (see,
e.g., Stacey & Connors 2009). Such objects are good
candidates for in situ study, sample return missions, or
even commercial mining (e.g. Lewis 1996; Elvis 2012,
2014; Garc´ıa Y´arnoz et al. 2013; Harris & Drube 2014).
The three objects studied here and several other Earth
co-orbitals are included in the NHATS list of poten-
tially accessible targets that compiles attractive objects
of interest for, e.g., future robotic missions.

For NEOs with values of the semi-major axis close to
that of our planet, mean-motion resonances other than
the one with the Earth are relatively weak, but secular
resonances where the precession of the node of the per-
ihelion of a NEO relative to a planet librates could be
strong. The eﬀect of secular resonances for objects mov-
ing in orbits with semi-major axes smaller than 2 AU

and relatively low values of the eccentricity was ﬁrst ex-
plored by Michel & Froeschl´e (1997) and further stud-
ied in Michel (1997, 1998). Michel & Froeschl´e (1997)
found that objects with 0.9 < a < 1.1 AU are aﬀected
by the Kozai mechanism (Kozai 1962) that, at low incli-
nation, induces libration of the argument of perihelion
around 0◦or 180◦(see, e.g., Michel & Thomas 1996). An
argument of perihelion librating around 0◦means that
the orbit reaches perihelion at approximately the same
time it crosses the Ecliptic from South to North (the as-
cending node); a libration around 180◦implies that the
perihelion is close to the descending node. For higher
inclinations, the argument of perihelion usually oscil-
lates around 90◦or 270◦(-90◦) when the Kozai resonance
is in eﬀect. Examples of both behaviours are found in
our analyses above. The value of the argument of peri-
helion of 2015 XX169 is found librating about 270◦when
its inclination is high and about 180◦when its inclina-
tion is low (see Fig. 3, panel G). For 2015 YA, librations
about 0◦, 90◦or 270◦ are observed (see Fig. 6, panel G)
depending on the value of the inclination. In the case
of 2015 YQ1 and due to its overall lower inclination,
only libration around 0◦or 180◦is observed (see Fig. 9,
panel G).

Almost certainly, the three objects studied here are
fragments of larger objects, which may also be frag-
ments themselves. We can speculate that this can be
reconciled with a hypothetical origin in the Earth-Moon
system as suggested by, e.g., Margot & Nicholson (2003)
within the context of triggered resurfacing events when
a larger asteroid encounters our planet at relatively
large planetary ﬂyby distances, in the range 5–20 plan-
etary radii (see, e.g., Keane & Matsuyama 2015) or
alteration of the spin rate (Scheeres et al. 2005) and
subsequent rotationally induced structural failure (see,
e.g., Denneau et al. 2015). Several hundred NEAs have
values of the MOID under 20 times the Earth radius.
Within this hypothetical but plausible scenario, rela-
tively large fragments can be released when asteroids
pass close to our planet. These fragments may remain
within the orbital neighbourhood of our planet trapped
in the web of overlapping resonances that permeates
the entire region (see, e.g., Christou 2000; de la Fuente
Marcos & de la Fuente Marcos 2015a) and some of them
may populate the co-orbital zone, in particular if the
larger parent body was itself already a co-orbital. This
scenario is diﬀerent from the original hypothesis of ori-
gin in the Earth-Moon system, which was by impact on
the Moon (see, e.g., Warren 1994; Gladman et al. 1995;
Bottke et al. 1996; Gladman 1996).

In our simulations, the role of the Yarkovsky and
Yarkovsky–O’Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack (YORP) ef-
fects (see, e.g., Bottke et al. 2006) has been ignored.

14

The neglection of these eﬀects has no impact on the
evaluation of the present dynamical status of the NEAs
discussed here, but may aﬀect both the reconstruction
of their dynamical past and any predictions made re-
garding their future orbital evolution. Accurate mod-
elling of the Yarkovsky force requires relatively precise
knowledge of the physical properties of the objects af-
fected, which is obviously not the case here.

7 Conclusions

In this research, we have used N -body calculations and
statistical analyses to study the orbital evolution of the
recently discovered NEAs 2015 XX169, 2015 YA and
2015 YQ1. The main conclusions of our study can be
summarised as follows:
• Asteroids 2015 XX169, 2015 YA and 2015 YQ1 cur-
rently follow asymmetric horseshoe trajectories with
respect to the Earth (probability > 99.8%); they are
small transient Earth co-orbitals.

• Asteroid 2015 XX169 is the most stable of the trio and
it may remain in the vicinity of Earth’s co-orbital re-
gion for many thousands of years. Both 2015 YA and
2015 YQ1 may not stay as Earth co-orbital compan-
ions for long.

• Asteroids 2015 XX169, 2015 YA and 2015 YQ1 are
temporarily subjected to various forms of the Kozai
resonance during the integrations performed. This
secular resonance is stronger for 2015 XX169.

nated by horseshoe librators, 12 out of 17 objects.

• The known population of Earth co-orbitals is domi-
• Relatively poor orbital solutions can still be used to
obtain robust conclusions on the dynamical evolution
of NEOs if extensive statistical sampling of the orbits
is performed.

One of the objectives of this research is to bring these
interesting NEAs to the attention of the astronomical
community, encouraging follow-up observations. Spec-
troscopic studies during their next perigee should be
able to conﬁrm if an origin in the Earth-Moon system
as suggested by, e.g., Warren (1994), Gladman et al.
(1995), Bottke et al. (1996), Gladman (1996) or Mar-
got & Nicholson (2003) is plausible.
