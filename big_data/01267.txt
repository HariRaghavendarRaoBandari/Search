Abstract: The potential sensitivity to isospin-breaking eﬀects makes LHC searches for
mono-W signatures promising probes of the coupling structure between the Standard Model
and dark matter. It has been shown, however, that the strong sensitivity of the mono-W
channel to the relative magnitude and sign of the up-type and down-type quark couplings
to dark matter is an artefact of unitarity violation. We provide three diﬀerent solutions
to this mono-W problem in the context of spin-1 simpliﬁed models and brieﬂy discuss the
impact that our ﬁndings have on the prospects of mono-W searches at future LHC runs.

1 Introduction
At least two reasons make the process pp → W + ET,miss interesting in the context of dark
matter (DM) searches at the LHC. First, for leptonically decaying W bosons, this process
yields a distinct signature that can be searched for in dedicated analyses, which suﬀer
from signiﬁcantly less background than for instance mono-jet searches. Second, hadronic
W -boson decays will instead lead to a jets + ET,miss ﬁnal state and therefore render an
electroweak (EW) contribution to the mono-jet channel.1

These so-called mono-W searches have received signiﬁcant interest because they are
potentially sensitive to the sign between the up-type and down-type quark couplings
to DM [1]. The reason is that two diﬀerent diagrams contribute to this process and there-
fore interference eﬀects can be important. Indeed, LHC Run I analyses [2–4] based on an
eﬀective ﬁeld theory (EFT) approach to parameterise the interactions of DM [5–7] found
a striking diﬀerence in the predicted ﬁducial cross sections between same-sign (SS) and
opposite-sign (OS) couplings. In the OS case, leading to constructive interference between
up-type and down-type quark contributions, the mono-W results in fact turn out to set the
strongest limits on the suppression scale of the unknown mediating interaction, surpassing
the EFT limits that arise from mono-jet searches.2 In direct detection experiments, on

even higher jet multiplicities are included in the latest LHC searches.

upgrading their latest 8 TeV analysis [9].

the other hand, OS couplings lead to destructive interference and correspondingly smaller
event rates, making the LHC a particularly promising probe for this scenario.

Subsequently, it has however been pointed out in [10] that EFT interpretations of
mono-W signals have issues with unitarity violation, if the eﬀective higher-dimensional
operators break the SU (2)L invariance of the Standard Model (SM). This is for example
the case when considering pure vector DM-quark operators with OS Wilson coeﬃcients
for up-type and down-type quarks, as done in [2–4]. The enhancements of the mono-W
cross section found in these analyses is thus spurious, because it is due to the emission of
longitudinal W bosons. The EFT study [10] has recently been extended in [11] to the case
of simpliﬁed models with t-channel exchange of a new coloured scalar. In particular, it has
been shown that if these theories are formulated before EW symmetry breaking (EWSB)
in an SU (2)L gauge-invariant way, eﬀects associated with isospin breaking are generically
small. This leads to the conclusion that isospin-violating DM-quark couplings are not
expected to increase the sensitivity of mono-W searches in t-channel simpliﬁed models. It
was also pointed out in [11] that a similar solution is expected to be present in s-channel
simpliﬁed models.

The goal of this note is to fully develop the reasoning presented in [10, 11] for s-channel
DM models with vector or axial-vector mediator exchange. In Section 2 we demonstrate
that a naive calculation of mono-W signatures in spin-1 simpliﬁed models leads to un-
physical predictions, in particular the violation of unitarity at large energies. We point
out that this issue also aﬀects mono-jet searches once EW corrections are included in the
signal prediction.
In Section 3, we propose a simple solution to this problem based on
imposing certain requirements on the coupling structure of the simpliﬁed model. A diﬀer-
ent solution is derived in Section 4 by considering mono-W signatures in the SM, where
the potentially dangerous terms are cancelled via interference with a diagram involving a
triple gauge boson interaction. We discuss how this solution can be extended to simpliﬁed
DM models.
In Section 5 it is then shown that this second solution is indeed the one
naturally incorporated in Z(cid:48) models that obtain non-universal couplings to quarks from
mixing with the SM gauge bosons. In Section 6, we brieﬂy discuss how unitarity violation
can be parameterised by non-renormalisable interactions. The main ﬁndings of this note
are summarised in Section 7, while the impact of EW corrections in an existing mono-jet
search are studied in Appendix A.

2 The mono-W problem in simpliﬁed models

In order to illustrate the issues that can appear in the calculation of mono-W signals in
simpliﬁed DM models, we consider a spin-1 mediator Z(cid:48)
µ with mass MZ(cid:48) and a Dirac DM
particle χ with mass mDM. We write the relevant interaction terms in the Lagrangian as

(cid:3) χ − (cid:88)

In the context of such a simpliﬁed model, the mono-W signature arises at the LHC from
the process pp → W + Z(cid:48), followed by the decay of the Z(cid:48) into DM particles. A possible

process, the diagram on the right-hand side represents an EW correction.

Feynman diagram leading to a l + ET,miss ﬁnal state is shown on the left-hand side of
Figure 1. Notice that the interactions (2.1) also give rise to mono-jet signatures. There
are in fact both QCD and EW corrections to jets + ET,miss, which are exempliﬁed by the
middle and right diagram in Figure 1, respectively.

u = gV

The fundamental problem discussed in this paper is illustrated in Figure 2, which
shows the predicted ET,miss spectrum for leptonically (left panel) and hadronically (right
panel) decaying W produced in association with an invisibly decaying Z(cid:48). Our event
generation has been performed at leading order with MadGraph5 aMCNLO [12] starting from
the implementation of the spin-1 simpliﬁed model presented in [13] and utilises NNPDF2.3
parton distribution functions (PDFs) [14]. We consider pp collisions at a center-of-mass
energy of
DM = 1
and set all axial-vector and leptonic couplings to zero. The yellow curves in both panels
correspond to SS couplings gV
d = 0.25, while the red curves represent the OS coupling
d = −0.25. It is evident from the left plot in Figure 2 that the mono-W
choice gV
predictions for the two coupling choices do not simply diﬀer by a rescaling factor, but
that the predicted diﬀerential cross sections are fundamentally diﬀerent. Most notably the
ET,miss spectrum in the OS case is signiﬁcantly harder than that for the SS choice.

s = 8 TeV, employ MZ(cid:48) = 1 TeV, ΓZ(cid:48) = 56.5 GeV, mDM = 10 GeV, gV

The suspicious high-energy behaviour of the pp → W + Z(cid:48) amplitudes in the OS case
becomes particularly obvious in the right panel of Figure 2, where we compare the ET,miss
spectrum for hadronically decaying W to the ET,miss spectrum for a conventional mono-
jet analysis, where the jets arise from QCD interactions (see middle and right diagram in
Figure 1).
In the SS case, one observes that the ET,miss spectra for both processes are
similar, but that the overall cross section for the QCD process (blue curve) is signiﬁcantly
larger than that of the EW process (yellow curve), the latter amounting to a relative
correction of a few percent only.
In the OS case, on the other hand, we ﬁnd the EW
contribution (red curve) to the diﬀerential cross section of pp → jets + ET,miss to be harder
and to dominate over the QCD process (green curve) at suﬃciently large ET,miss values.
This ﬁnding turns out to be essentially unaﬀected by the parton shower, hadronisation
corrections and detector eﬀects. For spin-1 simpliﬁed model realisations (2.1) with OS
couplings, the EW channel pp → W (→ q ¯q(cid:48)) + Z(cid:48) (→ χ ¯χ) and not the QCD process pp →
jets + Z(cid:48) (→ χ ¯χ) is therefore expected to give rise to the majority of events in the high-

ET,miss signal regions (SRs) of LHC Run I mono-jet searches. That this expectation is
indeed correct is shown in Appendix A.

The paradoxical observation that an EW contribution appears to produce harder mono-
jet events than a QCD process casts doubt on the validity of the spin-1 simpliﬁed model
introduced in (2.1). Indeed, we will show below that the harder ET,miss spectrum in the
OS case is due to contributions that grow with energy and therefore potentially violate
unitarity. The aim of this note is to accurately describe the nature of this problem and
propose a number of ways of solving it by appropriately modifying or restricting the spin-1
simpliﬁed model under consideration.3

3 Unitarity violation and coupling structures
It is well-known that the production of longitudinal gauge bosons (such as Z(cid:48)
L) from
fermions can potentially violate unitarity at large energies (see for instance [15]). For
example, it was shown in [16] that for the spin-1 simpliﬁed model considered in (2.1) the
process χ + ¯χ → Z(cid:48)
L violates unitarity at large energies for non-zero axial-vector
couplings, unless a second dark Higgs is added to the theory. Since the amplitude is pro-
portional to the fermion mass, the corresponding process with light quarks only violates
unitarity at very large energies and can therefore be disregarded.

L + Z(cid:48)

3Note that, since the interactions (2.1) of the Z(cid:48) boson explicitly break the EW symmetry, the corre-
sponding Ward identities are no longer satisﬁed by W bosons in the ﬁnal state. As a result, the Goldstone
boson equivalence theorem does not hold, i.e. one does not obtain the same result at high energies when re-
placing WL ﬁelds by Goldstone bosons. In other words, since the gauge symmetry is broken, unitary gauge
and Feynman gauge are not equivalent and one cannot simply remove the mono-W problem by calculating
cross sections in Feynman gauge.

L, however, can lead to much lower scales of unitarity
violation. Following [16, 17], we calculate the helicity matrix elements for the case of
a left-handed up-quark and a right-handed anti-down quark (both of which are charged
under SU (2)L). Since the initial state has a total spin of 1, the process cannot proceed at
s-wave (M0 = 0). For the J = 1 partial wave (or p-wave), we ﬁnd in the limit s → ∞

with g the SU (2)L gauge coupling and MW the mass of the W boson. The helicity matrix
element is found to grow proportional to s at large energies. For

it will therefore violate the requirement for perturbative unitarity, |MJ| < 1/2.4

u − gA

In the SS case with vanishing axial-vector couplings, one ﬁnds for the combination
of couplings appearing in (3.2) that gA
d = 0 and hence the potentially
unitarity-violating term vanishes identically. For OS couplings, on the other hand, one
u (cid:54)= 0, if the axial-vector couplings are zero. The resulting

the large enhancement of the total ﬁducial cross section and the harder ET,miss spectrum
observed in Section 2 for the OS case.

The most obvious way to avoid this problem is to simply impose the requirement

(3.3)

on the coupling structure of the spin-1 simpliﬁed model (2.1). In order to understand this
requirement intuitively, let us rewrite the left-handed and right-handed couplings in terms
of vector and axial-vector couplings. For the sign conventions adopted in (2.1), one obtains

gL
q = gV

q − gA

q = gV

(3.4)

In terms of left-handed and right-handed couplings, the requirement (3.3) hence simply
becomes gL
d , i.e. left-handed up-type and down-type quarks should couple in the
same way to the Z(cid:48) mediator.

u = gL

Notice that the latter requirement would be automatically fulﬁlled, if one wrote the
quark couplings to the spin-1 mediator in such a way so as to preserve the EW symmetry,

axial-vector couplings, but cannot choose them independently from one another.5

It is however conceivable that the coupling structure of the Z(cid:48) boson is modiﬁed by
EWSB and that the spin-1 mediator ends up coupling diﬀerently to left-handed up-type
and down-type quarks. In this case, the unitarity issue of amplitudes like u + ¯d → W + + Z(cid:48)
needs to be solved in a diﬀerent fashion.

4 Interference with additional diagrams
In the previous section, we have shown that unitarity violation in the process pp → W + Z(cid:48)
can be avoided if we require that the Z(cid:48) couples with equal strength to left-handed up-type
and down-type quarks. We can compare this requirement to the couplings of the SM Z
boson, whose interactions with SM quarks can be written as

where sw and cw are the sine and cosine of the weak mixing angle, Qq denotes the electro-
magnetic quark charge in units of the elementary charge e and the weak isospin is given by
T3,u = 1/2 and T3,d = −1/2. It follows that the diﬀerence ∆gZ of the left-handed couplings
of the Z boson to up-type and down-type quarks reads
Z,u − gV

Z,d = g cw (cid:54)= 0 .

Z,u − gA

Z,u − gL

∆gZ = gL

Z,d + gA

(4.3)

In other words, the requirement (3.3) is not satisﬁed by the Z boson within the SM and as
a result, one might expect that the process pp → W + Z also shows a unitarity-violating
behaviour at high energies.

Indeed, when considering only the two t-channel diagrams shown on the left-hand side
and in the middle of Figure 3 the resulting amplitude grows with energy.
In the SM,
however, a third diagram is present, which involves a s-channel W boson radiating oﬀ a Z
boson. The corresponding graph is depicted on the right-hand side in the latter ﬁgure. It
involves a triple gauge boson vertex of the form

with gW W Z = g cw = ∆gZ and

5We emphasise that there are additional considerations that may further restrict the possible choices of
gQ, gu and gd. For example, to be consistent with minimal ﬂavour violation, the same couplings should be
chosen for all three quark families [18]. Moreover, models with non-zero axial couplings (i.e. gu (cid:54)= gQ or
gd (cid:54)= gQ) require additional structure in the Higgs sector, which may lead to strong constraints from Higgs
measurements or EW precision observables [16].

Figure 3. The three tree-level diagrams that contribute to u + ¯d → W + + Z in the SM. The
left and middle graph involves only couplings between quarks and gauge bosons, while the right
diagram contains a triple gauge boson vertex.

Combining the three diﬀerent contributions, one ﬁnds that in the high-energy limit the
square of the u + ¯d → W + + Z matrix element is given by

(4.6)

where Vud denotes the relevant element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, θ is the
scattering angle in the center-of-mass frame and d1, d2 and d3 label the contributions from
the three diﬀerent graphs. From the result (4.6) it is readily seen that while the individual
diagrams all diverge, their sum remains ﬁnite at large energies, since d1 + d2 − 2d3 = 0
for d1 = d2 = d3 = 1. Notice that the cancellation of unitarity-violating terms among the
diagrams of Figure 3 is not at all accidental, but a direct consequence of the local SU (2)L
gauge invariance of the SM.

The above observation motivates a second solution to the mono-W problem.6 If the
diﬀerence ∆g between the left-handed couplings of the Z(cid:48) boson to up-type and down-type
quarks takes the non-zero value

∆g = gL

it is still possible to avoid unitarity-violating processes by adding additional gauge boson
interactions of the form

with gW W Z(cid:48) = ∆g to the Lagrangian (2.1) of the spin-1 simpliﬁed model. Here TW W Z(cid:48)
denotes the W W Z(cid:48) analogue of the W W V interactions introduced in (4.5).

5 A Z(cid:48) boson with mixing

In this section we discuss a class of models where the additional interactions (4.8) between
the W bosons and the Z(cid:48) boson are automatically generated in such a way that they cancel
the potentially unitarity-violating contributions to the mono-W signal. The basic idea is
that the mass eigenstate Z(cid:48)
µ arises from an interaction eigenstate vector ﬁeld Xµ with the

the SM. At this point, we leave the entries Nij of the above mixing matrix unspeciﬁed.
Examples for how such a mixing matrix can be generated and a very brief discussion of
the constraints on the Nij that arise from EW precision tests will be given below.

The couplings of the interaction eigenstate Xµ can be parameterised in the same way
as in the spin-1 simpliﬁed model introduced in Section 2. Including only DM and quark
couplings, we write

However, as we have discussed in Section 4, the SM Z boson couples diﬀerently to left-
handed up-type and down-type quarks and in the presence of mixing the Z(cid:48) can inherit
this diﬀerence. The induced couplings between the Z(cid:48) and SM fermions are discussed for
example in [19].7 For the left-handed quark couplings, one obtains

coupling diﬀerence (4.7) thus takes the simple form

u − f L

d = 0 and due to the SS of the terms proportional to N13, the

∆g = gL

u − gL

d = g N23 .

(5.4)

In addition to the couplings (5.3), the mixing matrix N entering (5.1) also induces
couplings of the Z(cid:48) to other SM particles [20]. In particular, the SM W W Z vertex (4.4)
will lead to W W Z(cid:48) interactions. Since the triple gauge boson vertex arises from the non-
abelian SU (2)L, the induced coupling turns out to be proportional to

gW W Z(cid:48) = g N23 ,

(5.5)
and of the form (4.5). The resulting W W Z(cid:48) interaction is therefore precisely that given
in (4.8). As discussed in Section 4, the unitarity issue of the u + ¯d → W + + Z(cid:48) channel
is then solved by the interference of the two diagrams with t-channel quark exchange and
the single graph involving a s-channel W boson.

7Notice that the sign convention for the axial-vector couplings used in [19] is opposite to the one adopted

in the present work.

It is also important to realise that in the class of models discussed in this section, the
mono-W channel in addition receives a contribution from pp → W +Z (→ χ ¯χ), since the SM
Z-boson ﬁeld Zµ inherits the direct DM couplings f V
DM from the interaction ﬁeld
Xµ through mixing. Like (4.6) this contribution however remains unitary at large energies
as a result of the SU (2)L gauge invariance of the SM. This shows that the mono-W problem
is indeed absent in Z(cid:48) models with mixing.

DM and f A

Since we did not specify the origin of the gauge boson mixings Nij, our conclusions
apply to a range of diﬀerent scenarios. For example, a non-zero entry N23 can be generated

We note for Z(cid:48)-boson masses in the TeV range both  and δm2/M 2
Z have to be very small (of
the order of 10−2 or below) in order not to violate bounds from EW precision measurements
(see e.g. [19]).

6 Parametrising unitarity violation with non-renormalisable interactions
In the previous section, we have seen that Z(cid:48) models with mixing remain unitary at high
energies, if they are SU (2)L symmetric in the absence of mixing. While this treatment
covers most of the simplest models for a spin-1 mediator, there may of course be more
complicated models with additional heavy particles at a new-physics scale Λ. In such a
model, the couplings of the mediator to the left-handed up-type and down-type quarks

As a result, the mono-W problem may still be present in such models. Notice that
this is not a theoretical inconsistency, because unitarity violation is a generic feature of
s (or more generically the momentum
EFTs once the partonic centre-of-mass energy
transfer relevant for the process under consideration) approaches the new-physics scale Λ.9
The mono-W problems thus does not preclude meaningful calculations within the EFT
parameterisation (6.2), provided the scale Λ is suﬃciently large. In fact, one can translate
the bound (3.2) into a limit on the new-physics scale Λ for a given partonic centre-of-mass
energy:

s = 13 TeV LHC does on average not probe partonic center-of-mass
energies of 13 TeV, so a smaller new-physics scale Λ and therefore larger OS couplings may
in practice be acceptable. A proper treatment is likely to require a self-consistent truncation
procedure, which discards all events with a momentum transfer larger than Λ (as discussed
for instance in [26, 27]). For example, to consistently study the OS example considered
in Section 2, one should only consider kinematic conﬁgurations with
s < 6.1 TeV (for
MZ(cid:48) = 1 TeV). Such a truncation is expected to lead to a notable reduction of the LHC
sensitivity to mono-W signatures.

7 Summary

In the context of simpliﬁed models with spin-1 mediators, we have discussed the so-called
mono-W problem, i.e. the violation of perturbative unitarity in the process pp → W +
ET,miss, and proposed three diﬀerent solutions. These are

1. Restricted coupling structures: The mono-W problem is absent if the coupling
structure of the simpliﬁed model is restricted in such a way that the spin-1 mediator
couples equally to left-handed up-type and down-type quarks gL
d . This require-
ment is automatically satisﬁed if the interaction between the Z(cid:48) and the quarks are
formulated in an SU (2)L invariant way.

8In the speciﬁc case (6.1), the new-physics scale Λ appearing in (6.2) is given by Λ = (2(cid:12)(cid:12)Λ2

(cid:12)(cid:12))1/2.

u − Λ2

9The eﬀect of unitarity violation in EFT models for DM has been discussed in [23–25].

u (cid:54)= gL

2. Additional interactions: For gL

d , the mono-W problem can still be solved
if an additional interaction between the spin-1 mediator and SM W bosons is in-
troduced, which is proportional to the diﬀerence between the left-handed couplings.
The interference between t-channel quark exchange and s-channel W -boson diagrams
then removes the potentially dangerous contributions.

3. Small couplings: If no additional interactions between the Z(cid:48) and W bosons are
present, the mono-W process will violate perturbative unitarity at large energies.
The scale of unitarity violation may however be larger than the energies probed in
a given process, if the diﬀerence between the couplings to up-type and down-type
quark couplings is suﬃciently small.

We have argued that the ﬁrst solution is realised in the simplest Z(cid:48) models, whereas the
second solution appears naturally in Z(cid:48)-boson scenarios with mixing. If a more general
model is to be considered, the third solution allows for a general assessment of the validity
of a chosen coupling structure in a given experimental environment.

The arguments presented in our work strongly suggest that the sensitivity of mono-W
searches to the parameter space of spin-1 simpliﬁed models cannot exceed that of the mono-
jet channel. This conclusion seems to hold irrespectively of how the unitarity problem in
the pp → W + ET,miss process is tamed. The same verdict has been previously reached
in [10, 11] for the EFT case and t-channel simpliﬁed DM models with coloured scalar
exchange.
It has also been argued in [11] that the mono-W problem is not present in
s-channel models if they are formulated in a gauge-invariant way, and our note explicitly
proves this conjecture.

A EW contributions to mono-jet searches
In this appendix, we discuss the numerical impact of EW contributions of the form pp →
W (→ q ¯q(cid:48)) + Z(cid:48) (→ χ ¯χ) to mono-jet signatures at the LHC, comparing the eﬀects to the
corrections associated to the QCD process pp → jets + Z(cid:48) (→ χ ¯χ). To make this exercise
concrete, we consider the recent ATLAS search [28], which is based on 20.3 fb
s =
8 TeV data. We use MadGraph5 aMCNLO with NNPDF2.3 PDFs to generate partonic events.
The simulated parton-level events were showered with PYTHIA 6 [29] and analysed with the
publicly available code CheckMATE [30], which relies on DELPHES 3 [31] as a fast detector

simulation. To cluster jets we used FastJet [32] employing the anti-kt algorithm [33] with
radius parameter R = 0.4.

In the ATLAS analysis the following preselection criteria are imposed. Events are
required to have a reconstructed primary vertex, ET,miss > 150 GeV and at least one jet
with pT > 30 GeV and |η| < 4.5 in the ﬁnal state. Events that do not pass certain jet
quality requirements or do contain charged leptons or isolated tracks are rejected. Events
having a leading jet with pT > 120 GeV and |η| < 2.0 are selected, if the leading-jet pT and
the ET,miss satisfy pT /ET,miss > 0.5. Furthermore, the requirement ∆φ(jet, (cid:126)pT,miss) > 1.0
on the azimuthal separation between the direction of the missing transverse momentum
and that of each of the selected jets is imposed. Nine distinct SRs are considered with the
following ET,miss thresholds {150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 500, 600, 700} GeV.

Our results for the ﬁducial mono-jet cross section corresponding to SR1 to SR9 are
shown in the two panels of Figure 4. The plots are based on MZ(cid:48) = 1 TeV, mDM = 10 GeV
and all leptonic couplings are taken to be zero. In the left (right) panel we present the

ΓZ(cid:48) = 56.5 GeV and ΓZ(cid:48) = 55.5 GeV assuming a minimal width. One ﬁrst observes that the
obtained results are to good approximation independent of whether vector or axial-vector
exchange is considered. Second, while the ﬁducial cross sections corresponding to the QCD
contributions (blue and green markers) are within statistical uncertainties identical for the
SS and OS choices, in the EW case the OS signal strengths (red markers) are, depending on
the considered SR, larger than the SS predicitons (yellow markers) by a factor of around 25
to 400. One also sees that, as a result of the constructive interference in the OS case,
