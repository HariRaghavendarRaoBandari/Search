Abstract –Stochastic dynamics with random resetting leads to a non-equilibrium steady state.
Here, we consider the thermodynamics of resetting by deriving the ﬁrst and second law for re-
set processes far from equilibrium. We identify the contributions to the entropy production of
the system which arise due to resetting and show that they correspond to the rate with which
information is either erased or created. Using Landauer’s principle, we derive a bound on the
amount of work that is required to maintain a resetting process. We discuss diﬀerent regimes of
resetting, including a Maxwell’s demon scenario where heat is extracted from a bath at constant
temperature.

Introduction. – Stochastic processes with resetting,
that is a sudden transition to a single preselected state or
region in phase space, have attracted a lot of interest re-
cently. They arise in a range of problems from the optimi-
sation of search strategies (where resetting events restart
the search and can lead to shorter search times [1–5])
to kinetic proofreading [6–9] or even population dynam-
ics [5, 10, 11] (where a reset corresponds to a catastrophic
event), to name but a few.

From a thermodynamic perspective, resetting raises in-
teresting issues for three reasons. First, resetting changes
the information content of the system: once the system is
reset, all knowledge about its previous state is lost. In-
formation, however, is physical and deleting it comes at
a thermodynamic cost, an idea that goes back to Lan-
dauer’s principle and Bennett’s work [12, 13]. This con-
nection between information and thermodynamics has at-
tracted a lot of attention from stochastic thermodynamics
over the last decade, both theoretically [14, 15] and ex-
perimentally [16, 17]. Here, the question is what thermo-
dynamic cost is at least required to implement resetting
in a steady state. Second, a particularly intriguing appli-
cation of stochastic thermodynamics is analysing the eﬃ-
ciency of computation in biological systems [18–20]. The
key idea here is that the informational eﬃciency of, say,
a search strategy has to be weighted against the thermo-
dynamic costs of implementing it. Given the apparent

role of resetting processes in nature, an understanding of
the dissipation involved is thus paramount. Finally, the
competition between the stochastic exploration of states
and resetting, which constrains the system to a particular
region of its phase space, gives rise to a non-equilibrium
steady state (NESS). Such a state is characterised by a sta-
tionary probability distribution and a non-vanishing prob-
ability current and is an intriguing object of study in its
own right.

In this letter, we address these points by analysing both,
the thermodynamics of resetting a single colloidal particle,
arguably the paradigm for the ﬁeld [1,21,22], and resetting
a discrete system. We will derive the ﬁrst and second law
of thermodynamics in both cases and identify contribu-
tions to the well-established total entropy production rate
of stochastic thermodynamics [14] which arise due to re-
setting. We illustrate the physical interpretation of these
rates and their properties using several examples, includ-
ing an implementation of Maxwell’s demon that extracts
heat from a heat bath at constant temperature using re-
setting.

Thermodynamics of resetting. – We consider an
overdamped colloidal particle along a spatial coordinate
x immersed in a heat bath at temperature T . The par-
ticle experiences a systematic force F (x) = −∂xV (x) and
is randomly reset to a ﬁxed position x0 with a space-
dependent rate r(x) ≥ 0, as shown schematically in ﬁg. 1.
The dynamic of the particle is captured by an augmented

Fig. 1: Paradigmatic system with resetting. A colloidal
particle in a potential V (x) at temperature T is reset to
the origin x0 = 0 at a space-dependent rate r(x), resulting
in a probability current j from the origin to the region of
resetting.

Fokker-Planck equation [23],

∂tp(x) = −∂xj(x) − r(x)p(x)
+ δ(x − x0)

(cid:90)

dx(cid:48) r(x(cid:48))p(x(cid:48)) = 0

(1)

where

j(x) ≡ F (x)p(x) − ∂xp(x)

(2)

is the probability current. The second and third term on
the right-hand side of eq. (1) add the probability ﬂux out
of each point x and into the reset position x0 to the stan-
dard Fokker-Planck equation, ensuring that probability is
conserved. This interplay of drift and diﬀusion on the one
hand and resetting on the other leads to a non-equilibrium
steady state, where the probability distribution p(x) of the
particle’s position is stationary, but there still is a non-
vanishing current j(x). Here and for the remainder of
the letter, we set T = 1 and choose dimensionless units,
without loss of generality. For general r(x), eq. (1) has
analytical solutions only in a few cases.

To obtain the ﬁrst law for the system, we multiply
eq. (1) with V (x) and integrate by parts, using ∂xV (x) =
−F (x), to ﬁnd that

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

dx j(x)F (x) +

dx r(x)p(x) [V (x) − V (x0)] = 0 (3)

Following [14], we identify the ﬁrst term in eq.
(3) as
the rate of heat dissipation in the medium and the second
term as the work which is extracted from the system in
the steady state,

(cid:90)
(cid:90)

˙Q ≡
˙W out ≡

dx j(x)F (x),
dx r(x)p(x) [V (x) − V (x0)]

such that eq. (3) can be written as

˙Q + ˙W out = 0

which we interpret as the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics for
resetting in the continuous case.

The (Shannon) entropy of the system is deﬁned as

(cid:90)

Ssys = −

dx p(x) ln p(x).

(7)

and its derivative ˙Ssys = 0 in the steady state. Diﬀeren-
tiating eq. (7) with respect to time and inserting eq. (1)

(8)

Following [14], we identify
˙Sm ≡ ˙Q =

(cid:90)

dx j(x)F (x)

(9)

as the entropy production in the surrounding medium and
note that it equals the dissipated heat (4), as expected.
The last two terms on the right hand side of eq. (8) arise
from the resetting terms in the Fokker-Planck equation
(1), suggesting the deﬁnition

(cid:90)

˙Sabs ≡

dx r(x)p(x) ln p(x)

(10)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

as the absorption entropy rate, corresponding to the
change of Shannon entropy of the system due to proba-
bility ﬂux out of each point x. On the other hand,

˙Sins ≡ − ln p(x0)

dx r(x)p(x)

(11)

is the insertion entropy rate. It depends on the probability
density at the position x0 to which the particle is reset and
the probability ﬂux out of every other x. We call their sum
the resetting entropy production rate

˙Srst ≡ ˙Sabs + ˙Sins =

dx r(x)p(x) ln

p(x)
p(x0)

(12)

Equality in eq. (8) is reached for a vanishing current only.
However, as soon as r(x) is nonzero somewhere, there will
be resetting which directly leads to a nonzero current.
Thus

˙Sm − ˙Sabs − ˙Sins = ˙Sm − ˙Srst > 0

(13)

for a non-vanishing reset rate r(x), which we interpret as
the second law of thermodynamics including resetting.

Discrete dynamics.

Resetting can also be imple-
mented in discrete systems. We distinguish two types of
transition rates from state m to state n. For any con-
nected states m and n, transitions occur at a rate wmn,
which for thermodynamic consistency obey

where En is the energy of state n. Furthermore, resetting
from any state m to a ﬁxed state n0 is performed at a
state-dependent reset rate rm. The master equation is
then given by

where the last two terms on the right hand side account for

This is the second law of thermodynamics for a discrete
system with resetting.
We ﬁnally note that for time-dependent dynamics
∂tp(x, t) (cid:54)= 0 in the continuous and ∂tpn(t) (cid:54)= 0 in the
discrete case, respectively, leading to ˙Ssys (cid:54)= 0 in contrast
to eq. (20). However, the derivation of the second law can
be written analogously and it hence reads

˙Ssys + ˙Sm − ˙Srst ≥ 0.

(26)

for both continuous and discrete dynamics.

Resetting entropy rate and Landauer’s principle. Re-
setting can decrease or increase the Shannon entropy com-
pared to steady states without resetting, if they exist, de-
pending on whether the distribution p(x) is compressed or
broadened. For example, resetting a freely diﬀusing par-
ticle to some point x0 concentrates the particle to that
region and hence reduces the uncertainty about its posi-
tion, resulting in a resetting entropy rate ˙Srst < 0. Specif-
ically, for discrete dynamics we have pn ≤ 1 and hence
˙Sabs < 0, which reduces the system entropy due to the ﬂux
of probability out of each state n. For the continuous case,
no general statement about ˙Sabs can be made. On the
˙Sins > 0, while it can
other hand, for discrete dynamics,
be both positive or negative for continuous dynamics, de-
pending on the stochastic entropy of the designated reset
state, − ln p(x0). So inserting into a state with low steady
˙Srst > 0,
state probability increases the system entropy,
while inserting into a state with high probability eﬀectively
erases information from the system,

˙Srst < 0.

Let us expand on this last point by analysing the follow-
ing toy model for erasure. We consider a two-state system
with equal energy levels and a reset rate r from state 2
to state 1, but no thermal transition rates wmn. Starting
from the equilibrium state with p1 = p2 = 1/2 and Shan-
non entropy Ssys = ln 2, the probability p2 decreases ex-
ponentially, ﬂowing to state 1 and leaving the system with
Ssys = 0, implementing the erasure of a single bit. There
is no thermodynamic entropy production since wmn = 0,
but the rate of change of the system’s entropy ˙Ssys (cid:54)= 0 and
the second law (26) reduces to ˙Ssys = ˙Srst, with equality
due to the vanishing rates wmn, cf. (21). Integrating leads
to

dt ˙Srst = ∆Srst = ∆Ssys = − ln 2

which is exactly minus the minimal amount of work needed
to erase one bit originally derived by Landauer [12]. A nat-
ural question is now how the resetting entropy production
is related to Landauer’s principle more generally.

J. Fuchs et al.

On the single trajectory level, stochastic entropy is de-
ﬁned as s(t) ≡ − ln pn(t) [24] in the discrete case and
analogously for continuous dynamics. Each time a reset
from state n takes place, the system’s entropy changes
by ∆sn = − ln pn0 + ln pn and the energy of the system
changes by ∆En = En0 − En, corresponding to minus the
extracted work. The diﬀerence in non-equilibrium free en-
ergy then reads

∆Fn = ∆En − ∆sn = En0 − En − ln

(28)

Moving on to the ensemble level, we average using rnpn
and use the second law of non-equilibrium thermodynam-
ics [15,25] to ﬁnd the following lower bound for the amount
of external work necessary to maintain the resetting:

We can now identify the extracted work ˙W out (19) and
resetting entropy production (24), such that

˙W ext ≥ − ˙W out − ˙Srst.

(30)

We note that ˙W ext needs to be provided by the resetter,
but is not performed on the system and thus has no inﬂu-
ence on the ﬁrst law (6). This result gives a lower bound
for the work ˙W ext which must be performed by an external
mechanism to maintain the resetting process. Comparing
(30) to the non-equilibrium Landauer principle [15,25], we
thus ﬁnd that the resetting entropy production equals the
rate with which information is erased from or created in
the system. Hence, (30) implements Landauer’s princi-
ple in a steady state, providing a scheme complementary
to autonomous demons involving a tape as information
reservoir [26–28]. Two regimes emerge from this result:
to continuously reduce the information content of the sys-
tem in the steady state, we must apply work . However,
we can also extract work by increasing the system entropy,
leading to a Maxwell demon.

Examples. – We illustrate crucial properties of the
entropy rates that we have introduced with simple exam-
ples. First we revisit the freely diﬀusing particle with re-
setting and ﬁnd that ˙Srst ≤ 0, as we do for diﬀusion with
drift. However, this inequality is not a general result as
we show in our third example. We also demonstrate that
we can extract heat from the bath using a reset mecha-
nism and give a full discussion of the diﬀerent regimes that
emerge in our ﬁnal example.

Free diﬀusion with resetting. First, we choose r(x) = r
for |x| ≥ a and r = 0 otherwise. The ensuing steady state
has been solved by Evans and Majumdar [21] and is shown
in ﬁg. 2a. Since F = 0, there is no thermodynamic entropy
production ˙Sm = 0. The entropy rates related to resetting,

The key point here is that the resetting counteracts the
free diﬀusion by conﬁning the particle to a region around
the origin. This reduction in the uncertainty of the par-

Diﬀusion in a V-shaped potential. We now apply a
force F (x) = sgn(x)f to the colloidal particle which cor-
responds to a roof-top potential (f > 0) or a V-shaped
potential (f < 0) as shown in ﬁg. 2b. The particle is re-
set to x0 = 0 at a constant rate r(x) = r, such that the
Fokker-Planck equation (1) simpliﬁes to

The resetting entropy production rate obeys ˙Srst = −r <
0, so again resetting reduces the uncertainty of the sys-
tem. The thermodynamic entropy production depends on
the potential shape, determined by the sign of f . For
the roof-top potential, heat is dissipated into the medium
( ˙Sm > 0) and work needs to be performed on the system,
˙W out < 0. For the V-shaped potential, heat is absorbed
˙Sm < 0, while work is ex-
from the surrounding medium,
tracted. Thus in the latter case, the external reset mech-
anism operates like a Maxwell’s demon, extracting heat
from a bath at constant temperature. From the perspec-
tive of the second law, however, this is compensated by
the work ˙W ext required to maintain the resetting in the
steady state (30). Hence the resetter has to apply more
˙W out from the particle,
work than can be extracted as
ensuring thermodynamic consistency.

Resetting with ˙Srst > 0.

So far, the resetting entropy
production has been negative in all the examples. How-
ever, inspection of the rate, eq. (12), reveals that it can
also be positive if p(x) > p(x0) in regions of large r(x),
which can be realized in a setup like the one shown in
ﬁg. 2c. Here, we have a reﬂecting boundary at x = a,
hence j(a) = 0, and apply a potential V (x) = −f x for
x ≤ a. We reset the particle to x0 = 0 at a rate r(x) = r
for x ≥ 0 and r(x) = 0 otherwise. The steady state distri-
bution and current, calculated analogously to the second
example, are also shown in ﬁg. 2c. The entropy produc-
tion rates cannot be calculated in closed form for such a
system, but numerical results are shown as a function of

dashed line) and thermodynamic entropy production rate

shown in ﬁg. 2c with r = 1.

the force parameter f in ﬁg. 3. For f larger than a crit-
ical value fc, the resetting entropy production rate ˙Srst
becomes indeed negative, which corresponds to increasing
the information content of the system.

Operation diagram for the discrete random walk.

In
our last example, we expand on the idea of diﬀerent signs
for the thermodynamic and resetting entropy production
rates by considering the three-state system shown in ﬁg. 4.
The transition rates between neighbouring states are k+
from left to right and k− in the opposite direction. The
random walker is reset from states 2 and 3 to the ini-
tial state n0 = 1 with constant rate r. The master equa-
tion (15) is then easily solved for the steady state, yielding

p1 =[k+r + (k− + r)2]/N
p2 =(k− + r)k+/N
p3 =k2

+/N

(38)

with N ≡ k+(k+ + r) + (k− + r)(k+ + k− + r). In this

system, three regimes emerge with regard to the sign of
the rates of entropy production in the medium (18) and
due to resetting (24). We sketch them in the operation di-
agram, ﬁg. 5, as a function of the parameters k = k+/k−
and r(cid:48) = r/k−. For k < 1, as the random walker jumps
to the right, it absorbs heat − ln k > 0 from the reservoir
which is extracted as work ˙W out when it is reset to n0 = 1,
yielding an average thermodynamic entropy production of
˙Sm < 0, thus implementing a Maxwells demon. On the
other hand, for k > 1, the random walker produces en-
tropy in the medium at a rate ˙Sm > 0 and work has to
be put in to reset the particle, yielding ˙W out < 0, eﬀec-
tively lifting it to a higher state. Meanwhile, the resetting
entropy rate depends on the ratio of probabilities in the
initial state n0 = 1 and in states n = 2, 3, respectively,
either erasing or increasing the information content of the
system. However, for all r(cid:48) and k,

˙Sm − ˙Srst > 0.

Conclusion and perspectives. – We have derived
the ﬁrst and second law of thermodynamics for contin-
uous and discrete stochastic dynamics with resetting and
identiﬁed the contribution of resetting to the total entropy
production. This resetting entropy rate ˙Srst quantiﬁes the

rate of information creation or erasure in the steady state.
Using Landauer’s principle, we were able to derive a lower
bound on the work input required to implement a given
resetting mechanism. We note that work can also be ex-
tracted from the heat bath at constant temperature in a
Maxwell’s demon type setup at the expense of increased
external work input.

We expect that our results can be veriﬁed experimen-
tally, for example using colloids in an optical trap, which
have a history of successful validation of concepts from
stochastic thermodynamics [16, 29–31]. Among the av-
enues for further theoretical work, it should be worthwhile
to apply our framework to biological systems featuring re-
setting, such as the detection of pathogens by the immune
system [32]. An appreciation of the thermodynamic costs
involved could guide the search for the fundamental prin-
ciples underlying these highly eﬃcient processes.

plotted as a function of k = k+/k− < 1 and the normalised
reset rate r(cid:48)/k−. Heat is either extracted from ( ˙Sm < 0,
blue domain), implementing a Maxwell demon, or dissi-
pated into the reservoir ( ˙Sm > 0). The resetting entropy
production rate ˙Srst is negative in the blue and green do-
main corresponding to continuously erasing information,
but becomes positive in the brown domain corresponding
to writing information.
