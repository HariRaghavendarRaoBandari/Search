Mean-ﬁeld theory of atomic self-organization in optical cavities

(Dated: March 17, 2016)

Photons mediate long-range optomechanical forces between atoms in high ﬁnesse resonators, which
can induce the formation of ordered spatial patterns. When a transverse laser drives the atoms, the
system undergoes a second order phase transition, that separates a uniform spatial density from a
Bragg grating maximizing scattering into the cavity and is controlled by the laser intensity. Starting
from a Fokker-Planck equation describing the semiclassical dynamics of the N -atom distribution
function, we systematically develop a mean-ﬁeld model and analyse its predictions for the equilibrium
and out-of-equilibrium dynamics. The validity of the mean-ﬁeld model is tested by comparison
with the numerical simulations of the N -body Fokker-Planck equation and by means of a BBGKY
hierarchy. The mean-ﬁeld theory predictions well reproduce several results of the N -body Fokker-
Planck equation for suﬃciently short times, and are in good agreement with existing theoretical
approaches based on ﬁeld-theoretical models. Mean-ﬁeld, on the other hand, predicts thermalization
time scales which are at least one order of magnitude shorter than the ones predicted by the N -body
dynamics. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the mean-ﬁeld ansatz discards the eﬀects
of the long-range incoherent forces due to cavity losses.

INTRODUCTION

Optically-dense atomic ensembles oﬀer a formidable
framework to study collective eﬀects induced by atom-
photon interactions [1–3]. Correlations are established by
multiple photon scattering [4, 5], which can give rise to
phenomena such as synchronization [6, 7], optomechan-
ical bistability [8, 9], and spontaneous spatial ordering
[2, 3, 10–12]. Envisaged applications for these systems
range from sensors [13], to quantum-enhanced metrology
[14] and quantum simulators [12, 15].

Single-mode cavities,

furthermore, mediate strong
long-range interactions between the atoms [16–18], sim-
ilarly to gravitational and Coulomb potential in two or
more dimensions [19]. In view of this analogy, it is rele-
vant to study the dynamics of these systems at and out-
of-equilibrium so to test in a laboratory conjectures and
predictions, such as ensemble inequivalence and the ex-
istence of quasi-stationary states [16]. The realization
in quantum optical setups, like the one sketched in Fig.
1(a), brings additional peculiar features. In fact, these
systems are intrinsically lossy, so that non-trivial dynam-
ics can be observed only in presence of a pump. On the
one hand, the conservative potential mediated by the cav-
ity photons shares several analogies with the one of the
Hamiltonian-Mean-Field model [17, 19–21], of which sev-
eral features are well reproduced by a mean-ﬁeld descrip-
tion [19, 20]. On the other hand, cavity losses give rise to
damping and diﬀusion, which are characterized by a spa-
tial structure, thus establishing long-range correlations
between the atoms [17, 22]. These correlations, in turn,
cannot be captured by a mean-ﬁeld description.

In this work we systematically develop a mean-ﬁeld
model for cold atoms in a standing-wave resonator, in
the setup illustrated in Fig. 1(a), and test its valid-
ity by comparing its predictions with the ones of the

Fokker-Planck equation for the full atoms distribution
[22]. This work completes a series of papers, which anal-
yse the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of
spatial self-organization of atomic ensembles in a single-
mode resonator. Our analysis is based on a semiclassi-
cal treatment, and speciﬁcally on a Fokker-Planck equa-
tion (FPE) for the N -atom distribution, derived when
the atoms are classically polarizable particles and their
center-of-mass motion is conﬁned to one dimension [22].
The cavity ﬁeld, instead, is a full quantum variable. This
makes our treatment applicable also in the shot-noise
limit [22] and gives access to regimes that are comple-
mentary to those based on the model in Ref. [23], where
the ﬁeld is a semiclassical variable.
Our formalism permits us to consistently eliminate the
cavity variables from the equations of motion of the
atoms and to investigate the properties of the cavity ﬁeld
across the self-organization threshold, where the intra-
cavity ﬁeld is characterized by large ﬂuctuations. Start-
ing from this model in Ref. [21] we analysed the station-
ary state of the N -body FPE, and showed that (i) this is
a thermal state whose temperature is determined by the
linewidth of the resonator, and (ii) that the transition
to self-organization is a Landau-type second-order phase
transition, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b)-(c). In Ref.
[21]
we also determined the corresponding phase diagram as
a function of the physical parameters and predicted the
corresponding features in the light emitted by the res-
onator.
[24] we investigated the dynamics fol-
lowing sudden quenches across the phase transition, and
found that the interplay between long-range conservative
and dissipative forces gives rise to prethermalization dy-
namics, where the long-range nature of dissipation plays
an essential role.
In this work we derive a mean-ﬁeld treatment from our
N -atom FPE. We then benchmark the limits of valid-

of a stability analysis and the analytical results are com-
pared with the numerical simulations of the mean-ﬁeld
FPE. Section V reports a critical analysis of the limits of
validity of the mean-ﬁeld treatment. In Sec. VI the con-
clusions are drawn, while in the Appendix A calculations
are reported that complement the material presented in
Sec. III.

II. DERIVATION OF THE MEAN-FIELD

MODEL

In this section we derive the mean-ﬁeld model starting
from the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) describing the
dynamics of an atomic ensemble in the optical potential
of a high-ﬁnesse resonator of Ref.
[22]. The atoms are
N , have mass m, their motion is assumed to be conﬁned
along the x-axis, which also coincides with the axis of a
high-ﬁnesse cavity and within whose mirrors the atoms
are spatially trapped. In the following we denote their
canonically-conjugated positions and momenta by xj and
pj (j = 1, . . . , N ). The atomic dipole strongly couples to
one cavity mode and is transversally driven by a laser,
as sketched in Fig. 1(a). The parameter regime is such
that the atoms coherently scatter photons into the cavity
mode and their external motion is determined by the
light forces associated with these processes. The light
forces are periodic, and their period is determined by the
cavity mode standing wave, whose spatial mode function
is cos(kx), with k the cavity-mode wave number.

A. Basic assumptions

Before reporting the FPE which governs the dynam-
ics of the N -body distribution function, we summarize
the main approximations behind its derivation and the
corresponding physical parameters.

One basic assumption of our model is that the only rel-
evant scattering processes are coherent. This regime can
be reached when the cavity mode and laser frequencies
are tuned far oﬀ resonance from the atomic transition
[34, 35]. We denote by ∆a = ωL − ω0 the detuning be-
tween laser (ωL) and atomic frequency (ω0), and assume
that this is the largest parameter of the problem. It is
thus larger than the coupling strengths for the interac-
tion between dipole and ﬁelds. It is also larger than the
detuning ∆c = ωL − ωc between laser and cavity mode
frequency, whose wave numbers are to good approxima-
tion denoted by the same parameter k. This allows us to
eliminate the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms by
a perturbative expansion in the lowest order of the small
parameter 1/|∆a|.

The cavity ﬁeld is treated as a quantum mechani-
cal variable and the dynamics can be cast as an opto-
mechanical coupling between atomic motion and cavity
ﬁeld [10, 23]. The parameter regime we assume gives rise
to a time-scale separation, such that the cavity degrees

FIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Atoms in a standing-wave cavity
and driven by a transverse laser can spontaneously form or-
dered patterns when the amplitude of the laser coupling Ω, ex-
ceeds a threshold value Ωc, which depends on the rate of pho-
ton losses, here due to cavity decay at rate κ. In this regime
the system undergoes a second-order phase transition which
is characterised by the parameter Θ, indicating spatial order-
ing of the atoms in Bragg gratings and deﬁned in Eq. (4). Its
expectation value in the mean-ﬁeld description is denoted as
ΘMF, see subplots (b) and (c), which display the thermody-
namic potential below and above threshold. The lower panels
are the single-particle density distribution f1(x, p) in phase
space. In (b) the atomic density is uniform, in (c) it is lo-
calized at the even or odd sites of the cavity standing wave,
(cos(kx) = 1 or −1, respectively). In this work we derive and
discuss a mean-ﬁeld theory for the dynamics of f1(x, p).

This work is organized as follows.

ity of the mean-ﬁeld ansatz by means of numerical sim-
ulations using the full N -body FPE and by means of
a BBGKY hierarchy. The results we obtain are com-
pared with existing literature on spatial self-organization
in single-mode cavities, both for the semiclassical treat-
ment [25–28], as well as for the case in which the atomic
quantum statistics is assumed to be relevant [15, 28–33].
II the
Fokker-Planck Equation at the basis of our analysis is
reported and the corresponding mean-ﬁeld equation is
derived.
III the stationary properties of the
mean-ﬁeld FPE distribution function are analytically de-
termined. The mean-ﬁeld predictions are compared with
the ones of the N -body FPE and with further existing
theoretical works. In Sec. IV the Vlasov equation, which
describes the short time dynamics of the mean-ﬁeld FPE,
is derived. Its predictions are then determined by means

of freedom evolve on a faster time-scale than the motion.
This is warranted when the cavity line width κ, which
determines the relaxation rate of the resonator state, is
much larger than the recoil frequency ωr = k2/(2m),
which scales the exchange of mechanical energy between
light and atoms.
In this limit the cavity ﬁeld is elimi-
nated from the equations of motion of the atomic exter-
nal degrees of freedom in a perturbative expansion to ﬁrst
order in the small parameter 1/κ, implementing a pro-
cedure ﬁrst applied in Ref.
[36]. The hierarchy of time
scales is set by the inequalities |∆a| (cid:29) κ (cid:29) ωr. This is
also consistent with a semiclassical treatment, since the
kinetic energy of the atoms at steady state scales with
κ thus warranting that the width ∆p of the single-atom
momentum distribution is large in comparison to the lin-
ear momentum k carried by each photon [10, 17, 21].

B. Collective motion of N atoms in a cavity ﬁeld

equation of atoms

The approximations above discussed are at the ba-
sis of the theoretical procedure which connects the
master
in a quantized cavity
ﬁeld with the FPE for the Wigner function fN =
fN (x1, . . . , xN ; p1, . . . , pN ; t), describing the positions
and momenta of the N atoms at time t. The derivation
is detailed in Ref. [22] and the resulting FPE reads

i=1

∂fN

fN + S2L[fN ] ,

(1)

where the second summand on the right-hand side (RHS)
is due to mechanical eﬀects of the cavity ﬁeld on the
atoms and scales like S2. Here S = Ωg/∆a is the scat-
tering amplitude between laser and cavity mode, it is
proportional to the laser strength Ω and to the cavity
vacuum Rabi frequency g, which scale the interaction
between dipole and laser and between dipole and cavity,
respectively. Operator L[fN ] takes the form

S2L[fN ] =

Each line on the RHS of Eq. (2) has a physical mean-
ing. The ﬁrst term describes the dynamics due to the

(4)

so that the potential mediates long-range interactions
between the atoms. Parameter (cid:104)|Θ|(cid:105)N is the order pa-
rameter of self-organization, where (cid:104)·(cid:105)N denotes the ex-
pectation value taken over the normalized distribution
fN . Speciﬁcally, when the atoms form Bragg grating,
then (cid:104)|Θ|(cid:105)N → 1 and the potential depth is maximal.
When the atoms are instead uniformly distributed in
space, then (cid:104)|Θ|(cid:105)N (cid:39) 0 and the potential vanishes. We
note that the Bragg gratings minimize the potential when
∆c < 0, otherwise the uniform distribution is energeti-
cally favoured. We will here denote (cid:104)|Θ|(cid:105)N by magneti-
zation, due to the mapping of the self-organization tran-
sition to a ferromagnetic model [21].
For later convenience, we deﬁne the parameter

F0 = (k)

2∆c

κ2 + ∆2

,

(5)

such that V = F0(N SΘ)2/(2k).

The second term on the RHS, Eq. (2b), describes a

dissipative force and is scaled by the coeﬃcient Γ0:

Γ0 = ωr

8∆cκ
(κ2 + ∆2

c)2 .

(6)

This term is due to non-adiabatic corrections in the dy-
namics of the cavity ﬁeld.

Term in the line (2c) corresponds to diﬀusion due to
ﬂuctuations of the cavity ﬁeld associated with losses.
The diﬀusion matrix is the dyadic product of the vec-
tor (sin(kx1), ..., sin(kxN )) with itself and scales with the
coeﬃcient

D0 = (k)2

κ

κ2 + ∆2
c

.

(7)

Therefore, beside the diﬀusion due to the diagonal ele-
ments, which is a single-particle eﬀect, we also expect
that term (2c) establishes long-range correlations.

The last line (2d) contains cross-derivatives and scales

with the coeﬃcient

η0 = 2ωr

κ2 − ∆2
c
(κ2 + ∆2

c)2 ,

(8)

whose sign depends on whether the ratio |∆c/κ| is smaller
or larger than unity, while it vanishes for |∆c/κ| = 1.
An analogous term has also been reported in the semi-
classical description of cold atoms in optical lattices [36],
where it has been then neglected under the assumption
of uniform spatial densities. Such assumption cannot
be applied in the self-organized regime, nevertheless we
will show that this term can be consistently discarded in
the thermodynamic limit we apply, which warrants Kac’s
scaling [19].

C. Mean-ﬁeld ansatz

N(cid:89)

To derive a mean-ﬁeld FPE we assume that the Wigner
function is factorized into single-particle distribution
functions according to the prescription

fN (x1, . . . , xN ; p1, . . . , pN ; t) =

f1(xi, pi; t) ,

(9)

i=1

where f1(xi, pi; t) denotes the distribution for the particle
i at time t and is thus deﬁned on the phase space of
this particle. We use then Eq. (9) in the FPE (1) and
integrate out all particles’ variables but one. In this way
we derive the mean-ﬁeld FPE, which reads

∂f1
∂t

= − ∂
∂x

f1 + S2L[f1] ,

(10)

and has same structure as the FPE in Eq. (1). Operator
L describes, as L, the mechanical eﬀects of light. How-
ever, it is now a nonlinear operator of f1 and takes the
form
L[f1] = − ∂

(13)

The mean-ﬁeld order parameter ΘMF is the expectation
value (cid:104)cos(kx)(cid:105), where (cid:104).(cid:105) indicates the average taken
over the single-particle distribution function f1(x, p).
The terms on the RHS contained in lines (11a) and (11b)
have a diﬀerent origin but a similar structure, which can
be recognized by analysing the form of the two summands
within the respective inner brackets. The ﬁrst summand
in each line describes the interaction of the atom with it-
self, mediated by the cavity ﬁeld. The second summand
in each line emerges from the interaction between the
atom and all other N − 1 atoms.

We further notice that the term in line (11a) can be
cast in terms of a conservative force originated from the
potential

and contains a term, whose corresponding term in Eq.

sult, we can rewrite Eq. (11) in the compact form

which allows us to simply read out the physical meaning
of the other terms, they are in fact the diagonal com-
ponent of friction, diﬀusion, and cross-derivative term in
Eq. (1).

III. STATIONARY STATE OF THE

MEAN-FIELD EQUATION

The stationary properties of the mean-ﬁeld distribu-
tion are analysed by means of the single-particle distri-
bution fst(x, p) that solves Eq. (10) with

∂tfst(x, p) = 0 .

(15)

In the following we determine fst(x, p) and then analyse
its predictions for relevant physical quantities.

A. Derivation of the steady state solution

In order to solve Eq. (15) we consider the ansatz

fst(x, p) = f0 exp(a(x) + b(p)) ,

where a(x) and b(p) are functions which only depend
on position and momentum, respectively, and f0 is the
normalization constant. Using this ansatz in Eq. (10)
we obtain diﬀerential equations for a(x) and b(p), whose
solutions read b(p) = −βp2/(2m) and
a(x) = (Y /2 − 1) ln(1 + Z sin2(kx))

with F(cos kx) = f0 exp(a(x)). Equation (18) describes
a thermal distribution provided that ∆c < 0:
In this
limit parameter β, Eq. (17), plays the role of an inverse
temperature at steady state. This temperature coincides
with the value found by solving the steady state of the
N -body FPE, Eq. (1), as shown in Refs. [17, 21].

We note that the function F(cos kx) depends on

ΘMF[fst], which leads to the ﬁxed-point equation

Its solution is in general not transparent, but it gets sim-

This consists in scaling the coupling strength g ∼ 1/

as the number of atoms is increased, leading to the scal-
ing relation S ∝ 1/

and are the equilibrium values of the order parameter ΘMF.
Inset: The resulting stable solution ¯Θ ≥ 0 as a function of ¯n
(in units of ¯nc).

This leads to a compact form of the stationary distribu-
tion in the mean-ﬁeld limit:

We thus see that in the thermodynamic limit the eﬀect
of the cross derivatives vanishes. For ﬁnite N , parameter
η0 is small but ﬁnite and in the stationary state it gives
rise to a correction to the eﬀective potential term, as
visible in Eq. (16).

B. Stationary properties in the thermodynamic

limit

The mean-ﬁeld distribution, Eq. (23), allows one to
analytically determine several properties of the steady
state. First, functional ΘMF in the exponent has to be
determined self-consistently. Using Eq. (20) in Eq. (19)
gives the relation

and is plotted in Fig. 2 for values of ¯n below, at, and
above ¯nc. The solutions of Eq.
(24) are the crossing
between the curve y = ζ and y = q (2¯nζ/¯nc), see Eq.
(25). For ¯n < ¯nc this equation allows for one solution,
corresponding to ΘMF = 0. For ¯n > ¯nc, the solutions
are three, of which two are stable and one is unstable.
The stable solutions give ΘMF = ± ¯Θ, with 0 ≤ ¯Θ < 1,
and correspond to the self-organized state. Close, but
above, the critical point the value ¯Θ can be analytically
determined and reads

¯Θ =(cid:112)2(¯n/¯nc − 1) .

(26)

The value ¯n = ¯nc, with ¯nc deﬁned in Eq. (22), deter-
mines hence a critical point, at which the transition to
self-organization occurs, and is controlled by the detun-
ing from the cavity ﬁeld and the cavity loss rate, for the
thermodynamic limit we chose. The results we obtained
so far for the stationary mean-ﬁeld distribution are in full
agreement with the ones found for the stationary distri-
bution of Eq. (1), see Ref.
[21]. The stationary mean-
ﬁeld distribution in Eq. (23) corresponds to the one that
is found from the stationary N -particle distribution after
integrating out the other N − 1 position and momentum
variables, and then taking the thermodynamic limit. The
equation for the order parameter, Eq. (24), agrees with
the one obtained for the N -particle case and obtained by
means of a saddle-point approximation. This agreement
is found also for the critical value of Eq. (22) and for the
temperature of Eq. (17). Hence, the mean-ﬁeld model
predicts the same phase diagram as the N -body FPE.

It is also instructive to consider the value of the bunch-

ing parameter B as a function of ¯n. This is deﬁned as

B =(cid:10)cos2(kx)(cid:11) ,

(27)

and gives a measure of localization of the particles at the
minima of the mechanical potential [21, 25]. Using Eq.
(20) we obtain

B =

1/2 ,
1 − ¯nc/(2¯n) ,

¯n ≤ ¯nc,
¯n > ¯nc ,

(28)

(cid:40)

in the stationary state. Therefore, below threshold the
atoms are uniformly distributed, while above threshold
they increasingly localize at the minima of the Bragg po-
tential. In particular, when the atoms are tightly-bound
at the minima, the above-threshold expression in Eq.
(28) delivers the amplitude of the ﬂuctuations, namely,

k2(cid:104)x2(cid:105) ≈ ¯nc
2¯n

,

(29)

showing that these are inversely proportional to the laser
intensity.

C. Comparison with existing literature

The results obtained so far by means of the mean-ﬁeld
model show a remarkable agreement with the predictions
of the stationary solution of the N -particle FPE, Eq. (1).
It is further worthwhile to compare the results here de-
rived with the results obtained in the literature by means
of diﬀerent approaches.

We ﬁrst discuss Ref. [25], where, amongst other stud-
ies, a mean-ﬁeld approach is developed based on plausible
conjectures. Here, the mean-ﬁeld potential is calculated
and the threshold of self-organization is determined by
(i) assuming that the stationary state is thermal, with
temperature given by the linewidth of the cavity, and (ii)
performing a stability analysis of the uniform density dis-
tribution. By means of this study a threshold value for
self-organization is identiﬁed, which agrees with the pre-
diction in Eq. (22), as it becomes evident after deﬁning
the threshold amplitude Sc such that

In particular, the quantity η∗ in [25] is in our notations
Sc∆a/g calculated for the case ∆c = −κ.

The stationary state of self-organization has been ﬁrst
derived in the following works [26, 27] by means of a FPE
as a function of the atomic and ﬁeld variables. This de-
scription assumes that the ﬁeld ﬂuctuations are small,
and thus cannot reliably reproduce the ﬁeld correlation
functions below and at threshold. It predicts, neverthe-
less, that the atoms steady state is thermal and its tem-
perature coincides with the inverse of Eq.
(17), apart
for corrections of the order ωr/κ, that are systematically

6

neglected in our approach because they are of higher or-
der. It further predicts the same behaviour of the order
parameter as in Eq. (26) above, but close, to threshold.
It is also interesting to compare our results with a
series of other theoretical studies, which focus on self-
organization of ultracold atomic ensembles in cavities but
discard retardation eﬀects: In these works only the con-
servative part of the cavity potential is considered, while
the temperature at steady state is due to the coupling
to an external heat bath [15, 28–33]. Even though the
conditions seem quite diﬀerent from our case, remarkable
agreement is found in the appropriate limits. References
[15, 29] analyse the self-organization transition of an ul-
tracold gas of bosonic atoms and derive the mapping to
the Dicke model. Here, the recoil energy plays an anal-
ogous role as the temperature, and the threshold which
is derived agrees with the threshold in Eq.
(22) after
setting

N S2

,

(30)

with β = 4/ωr. By means of this prescription, the
threshold also agrees with the one calculated in Ref. [28].
Furthermore, it also coincides with the one evaluated in
Ref. [33] when using the Boltzmann distribution for the
atoms statistics.
Another quantity which has been determined in these
works is the photon ﬂux, which corresponds to the intra-
cavity photon number in our treatment. In Refs.
[28–
31] the photon ﬂux scales as 1/|¯n − ¯nc| below threshold,
N . These predictions
while at threshold it diverges as
are in perfect agreement with the results we ﬁnd tak-
ing the stationary distribution of Eq. (1), see Appendix
A, Eqs. (A4) and (A5).
In particular, the intracavity
photon number at threshold, Eq. (A5), coincides with
the one calculated in Ref. [28] after substituting in their
equation ωz = (ω2
0 + κ2)/ω0 for the temperature, with
ω0 = −∆c. The result for the intensity-intensity correla-
tions at zero-time delay and below threshold, Eq. (A11),
further agrees with the result derived in Ref. [30, 31].

IV. MEAN-FIELD DYNAMICS

We now study the dynamics predicted by the mean-
ﬁeld FPE. We focus on the Vlasov equation, which we
derive from Eq. (10) by taking the thermodynamic limit,
according to our prescription. The Vlasov equation for
our problem reads

tion is thermal and with uniform spatial density, thus
f1(x, p, 0) = f1(p, 0) and ΘMF|t=0− = 0, with

(34)

and it corresponds to the potential in Eq. (14) after ne-
glecting the self-reaction term, which is of order 1/N .
Therefore, the validity of the predictions we will extract
are limited to suﬃciently short time scales for which the
corrections can be discarded. We will quantify this state-
ment in the next section.

A. Preliminary considerations: energy conservation

f1(p, 0) =

β0

We ﬁrst analyse whether Eq.

(31) warrants energy
conservation. We consider a class of functions for which
ΞMF[f1] = 0. This includes the stationary solution of Eq.
(23). For these solutions, the energy of one particle takes
the form

(t) =

+ ∆c ¯nΘ2

MF .

(33)

(cid:10)p2(cid:11)

In order to determine ˙(t) we thus calculate ˙ΘMF and
˙(cid:104)p2(cid:105). This gives

and therefore we get for the derivative of the energy

These derivatives hence vanish when ΞMF = 0, and thus
for the class of distribution fulﬁlling this condition, en-
ergy, with the potential term given in Eq. (33), is con-
served. Fluctuations, on the other hand, can give rise to
ﬁnite values of ΞMF. The purpose of the next section is
to analyse the stability and short-time dynamics of solu-
tions of the Vlasov equation, Eq. (31), after quenches of
the laser parameters.

B. Stability analysis of spatially homogeneous

distributions

We now analyse the short-time dynamics described
(31), assuming that at t = 0 the distribu-

by Eq.

where β0 is the inverse temperature. This distribution
is a stable solution of the Vlasov equation after setting
¯n = 0. At t = 0 the laser strength is quenched above
threshold so that parameter ¯n takes a ﬁnite value larger
than ¯nc. We then let evolve the distribution of Eq. (34)
by taking this value ¯n in Eq. (31). Figure 3 shows the
results of the numerical integration of Eq. (31) for dif-
ferent value of ¯n. We analyse these results, keeping in
mind that they are strictly valid for short times since the
Vlasov equation discards eﬀects, such as diﬀusion, which
are crucial in determining the stationary state. In (a) the
order parameter evolves from 0 to a ﬁnite value, about
which it oscillates. This value is smaller than the one pre-
dicted by the stationary solution of the mean-ﬁeld FPE.
It is reached after an initial dynamics characterized by
an exponential increase, whose slope is steeper the larger
is ¯n. Subplots (b) and (c) display the corresponding evo-
lution of the quantities Ξ2
MF, see Eq. (13). This quantity
emerges from the retardation eﬀects of the dynamics, it is
thus a signature of memory eﬀects, and mathematically
corresponds to the build up correlations between momen-
tum and position that cannot be factorized. The initial
distribution, Eq. (34), is chosen so that ΞMF = 0, and
we observe that the dynamics give rise to a build up of
a ﬁnite value of Ξ2
MF, with an exponential increase that
leads to a maximum where the curve for ΘMF reaches the
plateau. Then, it oscillates like ΘMF (one can well under-
stand the behaviour of these oscillations observing that
ΞMF is proportional to the time derivative of ΘMF) and
is exponentially damped to zero. In the initial phase, the
exponential growth of Ξ2
MF increases with ¯n, similarly in
the second phase of the dynamics, where ΘMF oscillates
about a ﬁnite mean value, the amplitude of the oscilla-
tions of Ξ2

MF are also larger the larger is ¯n.

We now analyse the initial exponential increase, which is in the regime where the Vlasov equation is a reliable
approximation to the full dynamics, as we also veriﬁed in Ref. [24]. In order to do so, we use a standard procedure,
which is also detailed in Ref. [19, 40]. For short times t after the quench, we write the distribution as

(35)
√
where δf1 describes small ﬂuctuations which can be due to the ﬁnite size of the system, and thus scale with 1/
N .
Using Eq. (35) into the Vlasov equation (31) and neglecting the terms of order 1/N we obtain the linearized Vlasov

f1(x, p, t) = f1(p, 0) + δf1(x, p, t) ,

δV = 2A cos(kx)eiωt ,

where A ∝ 1/
N is some constant and the amplitudes g1(p) and g−1(p) are sole functions of the momentum p. The
dispersion relation ω = ω(k) can be derived after using Eqs. (37) and (38) in the linearized Vlasov equation, Eq.
(36). By equating the coeﬃcients of exp(ikx) and exp(−ikx) we get expressions for the functions g1(p) and g−1(p).
With those expressions one ﬁnds the dispersion relation by using the deﬁnition δV = V [δf1] and Eqs. (32) and (38):

where ¯b ∝ γ. It can be shown that parameter γ, which
solves Eq.
(41), is a real number. Therefore, ω is an
imaginary number. In particular, if γ < 0 both Eqs. (37)
and (38) describe ﬂuctuations which are exponentially
damped and therefore f1(x, p, t) will tend to the initial

distribution, which is stable.
If instead the solution of
Eq. (40) gives γ > 0, the initial distribution is unstable
against ﬂuctuations. The value γ = 0 separates the two
regimes. After setting γ = 0 in Eq. (41) we thus get the

9

form of the distributions one obtains from the full N -
particle FPE [17, 21]. Nevertheless, the assumption still
captures essential features of the short-time dynamics of
distributions, which have initially the form of Eq. (9).
We will follow the procedure illustrated in Ref. [19, 42]
and study the validity of the mean-ﬁeld ansatz within a
BBGKY hierarchy, which we derive from the N -particle
FPE, Eq. (1). We will particularly focus on the dynamics
of two-particle correlations and determine the character-
istic time scale of their dynamics.
For convenience, we introduce the vectors x =
(x1, ..., xN )T
and deﬁne
fN (x; p; t) ≡ fN (x1, ..., xN ; p1, ..., pN ; t).

and p = (p1, ..., pN )T ,

A. BBGKY hierarchy of the photon-mediated

Fokker-Planck equation

For the derivation of the BBGKY hierarchy we assume
that the energy of the system is ﬁnite. This corresponds
to assume that the limit holds:

(cid:113)(cid:80)N

lim|p|→∞ fN (x; p; t) = 0,

(44)

where |p| =
i , and that expectation values of all
moments exist. Furthermore fN is periodic with wave-
length λ in every xi, which implies

i=1 p2

fN (x + λz; p; t) = fN (x; p; t),

(45)
for every z ∈ ZN . Distribution function fN is invariant
under particle exchange, which we can express by means
of the permutation matrix P, such that:

fN (Px; Pp; t) = fN (x; p; t),

(46)

where each row and column of P contain only one entry
diﬀerent from zero and equal to 1.
In order to derive the BBGKY hierarchy of the FPE in
Eq. (1) we ﬁrst deﬁne the l-particle distribution function:

and (46) from fN . Index l takes the value l = 1, . . . , N ,
such that for l = 1 the distribution fl is the single-particle
phase-space function, and for l = N it describes the N
particle state. The evolution of fl is found from Eq. (1)
after integrating out the other N − l particle variables,
and can be cast in the form

which is an external parameter. If β0 coincides with the
value in Eq.
(42) corresponds to the
same relation as in Eq. (22), which deﬁnes the critical
value of ¯n for self-organization. For the values of the
parameters, for which γ > 0, the uniform distribution is
unstable and tends to form a grating at the wave vector k
of the resonator with exponential increase, giving rise to
a violent relaxation. Parameter γ gives the rate at which
the amplitude of this density modulation grows.

Figure 4 compares the value of γ extracted by ﬁtting
the exponential increase of ΘMF in the ﬁrst phase of the
dynamics of Fig. 3 and for diﬀerent values of ¯n, with the
one determined by Eq. (41), showing very good agree-
ment. In particular, we note that in the limit |∆c| (cid:29) |γ|
Eq. (41) can be reduced to the form [41]

V. VALIDITY OF THE MEAN-FIELD ANSATZ

The mean-ﬁeld treatment is based on the assumption
that the distribution function for the N particle can be
approximated by the product of the single-particle dis-
tribution. This ansatz thus discards interparticle cor-
relations which emerge from the photon-mediated inter-
actions: the factorized ansatz is very diﬀerent from the

¯n/¯nc1234γ/κ00.020.040.060.0810

while Θ0[f1] = ΘMF and Ξ0[f1] = ΞMF. Note that when
the factorization ansatz of Eq. (9) holds, then Θ1[f2] =
ΘMFf1 and Ξ1[f2] = ΞMFf1. A closed set of equations
for fl can be thus strictly obtained for l = N , giving Eq.
(1), or for S = 0, hence in absence of the cavity ﬁeld.

tions of the Vlasov and of the Lenard-Balescu equations, and

For l = 2 we can generally decompose the distribution

function into two terms:

f2(x1, x2, p1, p2) = f1(x1, p1)f1(x2, p2) + g2(x1, x2, p1, p2) ,

(53)
where the ﬁrst term on the RHS is the mean-ﬁeld term
and the second term describes all corrections beyond
mean ﬁeld. When at t = 0 the distribution function
is factorized in a form like Eq. (9), the dynamics beyond
mean ﬁeld will tend to build correlations which are de-
scribed by g2. We obtain the mean-ﬁeld FPE, Eq. (10)
by performing the approximation G(1)
1 [f1]f1.
In the following we analyse the regime in which this ap-
proximation is justiﬁed by studying the equation describ-
ing the evolution of the function g2 under some approx-
imation, which permits us to truncate the BBGKY hi-
erarchy till second order. This equation is known in the
literature as Lenard-Balescu equation [19], and it will
allow us to identify a time-scale where the mean-ﬁeld
treatment provides reliable predictions.

1 [f2] → G(0)

In order to derive the Lenard-Balescu equation we ﬁrst consider the distribution function for l = 3. Using the same

type of decomposition as in Eq. (53), this can be written as

f3(x1, x2, x3, p1, p2, p3) = f1(x1, p1)f1(x2, p2)f1(x3, p3)

3(cid:88)

+

|ijk|f1(xi, pi)g2(xj, pj, xk, pk)

where ijk is the Levi-Civita tensor and g3 describes all three-body correlations which cannot be written as a function
of f1 and/or f2. We assume now that g3 is of higher order (from the treatment below we will see that g3 ∝ 1/N 2)
and drop g3 in the equation describing the dynamics of f2, Eq. (48). By means of this assumption we obtain two

i,j,k=1

+ g3(x1, x2, x3, p1, p2, p3),

coupled equations for f1 and f2, which can be then cast into the Lenard-Balescu equations for f1 and g2 using Eq.
(53) and which read

where we speciﬁed the arguments when necessary, and introduced the notation Θ1[g2]i and Ξ1[g2]i to indicate that
these are functions of (xi, pi).
The validity of the mean-ﬁeld FPE, Eq. (10), relies on whether one can discard term G(1)[g2] in the RHS of Eq.
(54a). Let us recall the thermodynamic limit for which S2 ∼ 1/N . If we now assume that g2 is of order 1/N with
respect to f1, then the term G(1)[g2] is of order 1/N with respect to G(1)[f1]f1. A detailed analysis of Eq. (54b) shows
that, if g2 ∼ 1/N at t = 0, this scaling is preserved by the dynamics. In fact, (i) the ﬁrst line on the RHS of Eq. (54b)
gives a scaling with 1/N because it is proportional to g2, while all other quantities are independent of N , (ii) the second,
third, and fourth lines are all proportional to S2 ∼ 1/N , (iii) the last two lines scale with N S2g2 ∼ 1/N . Therefore,
for suﬃciently short times the contribution of g2 to the dynamics in the mean-ﬁeld equation can be neglected.
We note that in Eq. (54a) the term L(1)f1 has also components which scale with 1/N . If one consistently neglects
all terms scaling with 1/N , then Eq. (54a) reduces to the Vlasov equation, Eq. (31), and therefore also neglects the
diﬀusion processes leading to equilibrium. Figure 5 illustrates the order of magnitude of the corrections to the Vlasov
and Lenard-Balescu equations, as well as the type of correlations that these describe.

C. Mean-Field versus full N -atom dynamics

In order to complete our analysis of the limits of valid-
ity of the mean-ﬁeld ansatz, we now compare its predic-
tions with the ones obtained by numerical simulations of
the N -particle FPE of Eq. (1). The latter are performed
by means of stochastic diﬀerential equations (see Refs.
[21, 22] for details). We focus now on the evolution of
the expectation value of Θ2, which explicitly depends on
two-particle correlations and scales the strength of the
conservative many-body potential. We recall the deﬁ-
nition (cid:104).(cid:105)N in order to indicate the mean value of a N -
particle observable taken over the N -particle distribution
fN .
Figure 6 compares the N -particle description where the
evolution of fN is governed by FPE (1) (solid line)
and the mean-ﬁeld description, where fN (x; p; t) =
f1(x1, p1; t)...f1(xN , pN ; t) and the evolution of f1 is gov-
erned by the mean-ﬁeld FPE (10) (dashed-dotted line).

The curves are plotted as a function of time and for dif-
ferent particle numbers, N = 20, 50, 200, where the pa-
rameter S2 has been rescaled according to our thermo-
dynamic limit so to warrant a threshold ¯nc which is inde-
pendent on N . The parameters have been ﬁxed so that
initially the distribution is spatially uniform, while the
momentum distribution is a Gaussian whose width coin-
cides with the asymptotic temperature of the dynamics,
Eq. (17). The strength of the ﬁeld is such that ¯n = 2¯nc,
therefore the asymptotic spatial distribution is a Bragg
grating with |ΘMF| ∼ 0.83. The dynamics we observe is
the one which leads to the formation of the Bragg grat-
ings starting from a uniform spatial distribution, and ex-
hibit three stages, which have been extensively discussed
in Ref. [24]: a violent relaxation, a prethermalized phase,
and a slow approach to equilibrium. The full lines are
the simulation of the full FPE, the dashed lines the cor-
responding mean-ﬁeld prediction, which indeed qualita-
tively reproduces the three-stage dynamics.

The violent relaxation is a stage of the dynamics where

12

of dissipation and diﬀusion becomes relevant, as shown
in Ref.
[24] by comparing this behaviour with the one,
where the dynamics is only due to the Hamiltonian term.
In particular, the relaxation time scale predicted by the
full simulation is about one-order of magnitude longer
than the corresponding mean-ﬁeld prediction. This be-
comes even more evident by plotting the curves rescaling
the time axis with N , as visible in the inset. The curves
of the mean-ﬁeld FPE collapse to one curve, whereby
the ones of the N -body FPE collapse to a signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent curve.

Let us now summarize these results. First, the short
time behaviour of the ﬂuctuations of the order param-
eter are well described by the mean-ﬁeld equation, and
in particular by the Vlasov equation. This is well un-
derstood in terms of the typical contributions to the dy-
namics: For short times the dominant contributions are
indeed the terms of Eq. (31) and interparticle correla-
tions are small, as we argued in the previous section.
Discrepancies are due to ﬁnite size eﬀects. The prether-
malized regime, moreover, exhibits a good agreement be-
tween mean-ﬁeld and full dynamics. This regime is domi-
nated by the Hamiltonian dynamics, and the results show
that Hamiltonian dynamics with long-range interactions
is well reproduced by the mean-ﬁeld description. Big de-
viations instead appear for long times, where the mean
ﬁeld ansatz is expected to fail and at the time scales
dominated by relaxation to the stationary state.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have systematically developed a mean-
ﬁeld description of the self-organization dynamics of
atoms in a high-ﬁnesse cavity. The predictions of the
mean-ﬁeld model have been explored at equilibrium and
out-of-equilibrium, its limits of validity have been tested
by comparing them with the ones of the N -body FPE.
We have found that the mean-ﬁeld equation provides
an excellent description of the dynamics when this is
prevailingly Hamiltonian. It further describes the equi-
librium properties of single-particle observables, includ-
ing the asymptotic temperature and the order parame-
ter. It fails, however, to reproduce the long-time out-of-
equilibrium dynamics.

Despite these diﬀerences, this analysis shows that from
the mean-ﬁeld model one can analytically extract sev-
eral predictions on the system dynamics.
It is indeed
remarkable that several predictions reproduce in the cor-
responding limits the ones obtained by means of other
theoretical treatments, some of which start from a fully
quantum mechanical treatment for the atoms. This on
the one hand leads us to conjecture that quantum ﬂuc-
tuations play a marginal role in determining the steady
state properties of the cavity ﬁeld. It further urges one to
develop a full quantum kinetic theory, analogous to the
full N -body semiclassical theory, which shall overcome
all limitations of simplifying theoretical assumptions per-

rameter evaluated by numerically simulating (dashed-dotted
lines) the mean-ﬁeld FPE, Eq. (10) and (solid lines) the N -
particle FPE of Eq.
(1). The curves correspond to diﬀer-
ent particle numbers N = 20 (brown), N = 50 (green) and
N = 200 (blue) and are calculated taking ∆c = −κ and
¯n = 2¯nc. The number T of trajectories taken for the N -body
FPE is T = 1000 for N = 20, T = 500 for N = 50, T = 100
for N = 200 (see Ref.
[21, 22] for details on the simula-
tions). The horizontal dotted line indicates the asymptotic
value of the squared order parameter. The inset shows the
curves of the onset with the time axis rescaled by N . Note
that the initial distribution of the full N -body FPE is the
one which statistically corresponds to a spatially uniform dis-
tribution with the same temperature as the asymptotic one.
Therefore, the value of (cid:104)Θ2(cid:105)N at t = 0 does not vanish due
to ﬁnite size eﬀects.
In order to compare these dynamics
with the mean-ﬁeld FPE, we have taken into account these
ﬁnite-size eﬀects in the initial mean-ﬁeld distribution given
by ˜f0(x, p) = (1 + δN cos(kx))f1(p, 0) where f1 is given in Eq.
(34) and δN is a spatial modulation depending on N .

there is a good agreement between mean-ﬁeld and N -
body FPE. This is the short-time regime where the
Vlasov equation, Eq. (31), is valid, and the behaviour of
the N -body FPE is reproduced by the one observed nu-
merically integrating the Vlasov equation, see Fig. 3(a).
This has been also veriﬁed in Ref.
[24]. The prether-
malized regime is also predicted by the Vlasov equation,
see Fig. 3(a). The mean-ﬁeld FPE, however, provides a
more accurate description and qualitatively reproduces
the N -body FPE. Nevertheless, a clear diﬀerence be-
tween mean-ﬁeld and N -body dynamics is found at the
onset of the prethermalized stage: In fact, the oscilla-
tions are damped at a faster rate in the N -body FPE.
Apart from this diﬀerence, there is a qualitative agree-
ment between mean-ﬁeld and N -body FPE also for this
stage.

While both mean-ﬁeld and N -body FPE agree in the
asymptotic value, we observe a striking diﬀerence be-
tween the two results in the relaxation to equilibrium
after prethermalization. This is the stage where the role

The value of the intracavity photon number above
threshold is found after observing that the exponent of
function G(α) has two minima that are given by the
non vanishing solutions of the ﬁxed-point equation (24),
which we denote by ΘMF = ± ¯Θ, with ¯Θ given in Eq.
(26). Therefore it holds

ncav = N ¯n ¯Θ2 ≈ 2N (¯n − ¯nc) ,

suﬃciently close to the critical point.
In particular,
the mean number of photons increases linearly with
¯n. We analyse now some properties of the ﬁrst order
correlation function of the intracavity ﬁeld, g(1)(τ ) =
limt→∞ Re(cid:104)Ecav(t + τ )Ecav(t)(cid:105)N . This function has been
extensively studied in Ref.
[21] by numerically solving
the N -particle FPE. Here, we will use the mean-ﬁeld
ansatz in order to better understand the two sidebands
of its Fourier transform, at which it exhibits maxima
above threshold. For this purpose we ﬁrst notice that
the correlation function is proportional to the autocorre-
lation function C(τ ) of the magnetization by the relation
g(1)(τ ) = N ¯nC(τ ), and

C(τ ) = lim

t→∞(cid:104)Θ(t)Θ(t + τ )(cid:105)N .

(A6)

We want to derive C(τ ) in mean-ﬁeld and hence the mean
value has now to be taken over the factorized distribution
as in Eq. (9) with the stationary mean-ﬁeld distribution
given in Eq.
(23). We calculate C(τ ) by solving the
equations of the mathematical pendulum

with initial conditions x(0) = x0 and p(0) = p0. The

In the limit of small oscillations, these equations describe
harmonic motion at the frequency

Appendix A: Cavity ﬁeld correlation function at

steady state

tion Ecav ∝ √

Experimentally accessible quantities are the correla-
tion functions of the ﬁeld at the cavity output, which al-
lows one to monitor the atoms state and is proportional
to the intracavity ﬁeld. In our formalism, the intracavity
ﬁeld is closely connected to the atomic state by the rela-
N ¯nΘ, therefore the correlation functions of
the cavity ﬁeld are proportional to the correlation func-
tions of the magnetization Θ [21, 22]. In the following we
determine the autocorrelation function of the magnetiza-
tion, which can be detected by means of the ﬁrst-order
correlation function of the ﬁeld, and the fourth-moment
of the magnetization (cid:104)Θ4(cid:105)N . As we showed in Ref. [21],
in fact, (cid:104)Θ4(cid:105)N delivers the value of the intensity-intensity
correlation of the ﬁeld at zero-time delay and at zero or-
der in the retardation eﬀects.

1. Field intensity across the transition

We ﬁrst determine the intracavity photon number ncav
at steady state for ¯n below, at, and above threshold. For
this purpose we use the relation [21, 22]

ncav = N ¯n(cid:104)Θ2(cid:105)N ,

(A1)

which, by introducing α = ¯n/¯nc, can be cast in the form
(see also the Appendix A 3)

ncav =

(A3)
We then analyse the prediction of this expression close to
threshold, for ¯n ∼ ¯nc and thus α ∼ 1. For this purpose
we expand the exponent of G(α) about the value y = 0
and consider the behaviour of ncav for α → 1−, hence
for ¯n < ¯nc but suﬃciently close to the transition point,
so that the truncation of the expansion is valid. In this

The mean frequency, however, is the result of the possible
trajectories of the mathematical pendulum weighted by
the probability density function fst(x0, p0). For x0 (cid:54)= 0
and p0 (cid:54)= 0 the oscillation period results to be larger than
2π/ω0 and this prediction ﬁts quite well the maximum
found numerically by integrating the coupled equations
of N particles, as shown in Fig. 7.

N → ∞. Below threshold, in Appendix A 3 we show that
the expression takes the value

g(2)(0)¯n<¯nc = 3 ,

which corresponds to super-Poissonian light. Corrections
scale with 1/N . The same holds for the calculation with
the factorized ansatz. Below threshold we get

mean-ﬁeld description cannot reproduce the value in Eq.
(A12). Figure 8 displays the mean-ﬁeld predictions for
the g(2)(0) at the thermodynamic limit and as a function
of ¯n. These curves are compared with the mean-ﬁeld cal-
culation at ﬁnite N and with the corresponding one of
the N -particle FPE. Even though the mean-ﬁeld curve at
ﬁnite N is tendentially closer to the thermodynamic limit
than the N -particle FPE prediction, they both converge
to the values of Eqs. (A10), (A12) (A11), depending on
whether ¯n <, =, > ¯nc, for N → ∞.

Eq. (1), for 100 trajectories of N = 50 atoms, ∆c = −κ, and
evolution time ttot = 104κ−1, see Ref. [21]. The lines are an-
alytical estimates of the spectrum maximum for ¯n > ¯nc. The
dashed line corresponds to the frequency of the correspond-
ing harmonic oscillator in Eq. (A8). The solid line is at the
frequency extracted by solving Eqs. (A7) for a mathematical
pendulum and in good agreement with the peaks position of
the numerically evaluated spectra.

Intensity-intensity correlations at zero-time

delay

The intensity-intensity correlation function at zero
time delay, g(2)(0), provides a direct measurement of the
fourth moment of the magnetization when retardation
eﬀects are suﬃciently small [21]:

(A9)
Above threshold (cid:104)Θn(cid:105)N = ¯Θn + O(1/N ), with ¯Θ the
solution of Eq. (24). Therefore, for ¯n > ¯nc we obtain

N /(cid:104)Θ2(cid:105)2
N .

g(2)(0) =(cid:10)Θ4(cid:11)

g(2)(0)¯n>¯nc = 1 ,

(A10)

which corresponds to coherent light and is valid at lead-
ing order, with an error that scales with 1/N . In mean-
ﬁeld for the factorized distribution, Eq. (9), we get

lines are the curves evaluated using in Eq. (A9) the mean-
ﬁeld steady state (23). The dashed lines are calculated for
the corresponding full N -particle distribution given in [17].
The black solid lines are the values at the thermodynamic
limit given at ¯n < ¯nc by Eq. (A11) and at ¯n > ¯nc by Eq.
(A10). The point at ¯n = ¯nc is at the value of Eq. (A12).
The discrepancy between the mean-ﬁeld curve and the full
N -particle predictions decreases as N → ∞, where they both
converge to the value given by the thermodynamic limit.
