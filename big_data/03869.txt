TRACE AND DETERMINANT PRESERVING MAPS OF MATRICES

Abstract. Suppose a map φ on the set of positive deﬁnite matrices satisﬁes det(A + B) =
det(φ(A) + φ(B)). Then we have

tr(AB−1) = tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1).

Through this viewpoint, we show that φ is of the form φ(A) = M ∗AM or φ(A) = M ∗AtM
for some invertible matrix M with det(M ∗M ) = 1. We also characterize the map φ : S → S
preserving the determinant of convex combinations in S by using similar method. Here
S can be the set of complex matrices, positive deﬁnite matrices, symmetric matrices, and
upper triangular matrices.

1. Introduction

Let Mn be the set of n × n complex matrices. Let Hn (resp., M +

n , Pn, Sn, Tn, Dn) be the
set of hermitian (resp., positive semi-deﬁnite, positive deﬁnite, symmetric, upper triangular,
diagonal) matrices.

Over the last years, one of the most active research topics in matrix theory is the linear
preserver problem (see [1], [10], [12]). Many interesting results about preserver problems in
diﬀerent matrices were discussed and obtained. They included preservers on determinant,
eigenvalue, spectrum, permanent, rank, commutativity, product, trace, norm, etc. In 1897,
Frobenius studied the following problem. Let φ : Mn → Mn be a linear mapping satisfying

Then there exist M , N ∈ Mn with det(M N ) = 1 such that either

det(φ(A)) = det(A),

A ∈ Mn.

or

φ(A) = M AN,

A ∈ Mn,

φ(A) = M AtN,

A ∈ Mn

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

(see [6]). Here At denotes the transpose of A ∈ Mn.
In 1959, Marcus and Moyls ([13])
proved that if φ : Mn → Mn is a linear map preserving the set of matrices of rank k for all
k = 1, . . . , n, then there exist invertible matrices U and V in Mn such that φ(A) = U AV
for all A in Mn or φ(A) = U AtV for all A in Mn. Applying this result, they gave another

proof of the problem (1.1). In 1969, Eaton showed that a linear map φ on the linear space of
n × n real symmetric matrices sending the elements in the cone of n × n real positive deﬁnite
matrices to the same cone and satisfying det(φ(A)) = c(det A) for a nonzero real constant c
must be of the form φ(A) = M AM t for some invertible matrix M in Mn (see [5]). In 2002
and 2003, Dolinar and ˇSemrl ([4]) and Tan and Wang ([14]) considered Frobenius problem
by removing the linearity of φ and changing condition (1.1) to

det(φ(A) + λφ(B)) = det(A + λB),

A ∈ Mn, λ ∈ C.

(1.4)

Then they showed that the conclusion is the same as that of the Frobenius Theorem, i.e.
φ is either of the form (1.2) or (1.3). Moreover, in [14] Tan and Wang also considered the
problem on Tn. In 2004, Cao and Tang ([2]) studied the problem on Sn.

Alternatively, Wigner’s unitary-antiunitary theorem says that if φ is a bijective map deﬁned
on the set of all rank one projections acting on a Hilbert space H satisfying tr(φ(P )φ(Q)) =
tr(P Q), then there exists a unitary operator U on H such that φ(P ) = U ∗P U or φ(P ) =
U ∗P tU for all rank one projections P . In 1963, Uhlhorn generalized Wigner’s theorem to
show that the same conclusion holds if the equality tr(φ(P )φ(Q)) = tr(P Q) is replaced
In 2012, Li, Plevnik, and ˇSemrl ([11])
by tr(φ(P )φ(Q)) = 0 ⇔ tr(P Q) = 0 (see [15]).
characterized bijective maps φ : S → S satisfying tr(φ(A)φ(B)) = c ⇔ tr(AB) = c for a
given real number c, where S is the set of n × n hermitian matrices, the set of n × n real
symmetric matrices, or the set of projections of rank one.

In this paper, we study the relationship between the maps preserving determinants and
trace equalities, and characterize this kind of maps. The paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we show that a map φ on S satisfying trace equalities tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1)
or tr(φ(A)φ(B)) = tr(AB) is linear, where S = Sn, Mn, Tn, or Pn. These results are useful
in the consequent sections. In Section 3, we consider the maps φ : Pn → Pn satisfying

det(φ(A) + φ(B)) = det(A + B),

(1.5)
Through diﬀerentiation, we can get tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1). Then we show that φ is of
the form φ(A) = M ∗AM or φ(A) = M ∗AtM for some invertible matrix M with det(M ∗M ) =
1. In Sections 4, 5, and 6, we consider the analogous problems on Sn, Mn, and Tn, and provide
the similar theorems to enrich Dolinar, ˇSemrl, Tan, Wang, Cao, and Tang’s results (see [2],
[4] and [14]).

A, B ∈ Pn.

2. Preliminaries

In this section, we provide some lemmas to show that some trace equalities could lead to

linearity.

Lemma 2.1. Let A and C be subspaces of Mn, B, D and E be subsets of Mn, φ : A → C,
f : B → D, and g : B → E be maps that satisfy the following conditions.

(1) tr(φ(A)f (B)) = tr(Ag(B)),

∀ A ∈ A, B ∈ B.

(2) Given C ∈ C, if tr(Cf (B)) = 0 for all B ∈ B, then C = 0.

Then φ is linear.

Proof. For any A ∈ A, B ∈ B, λ ∈ C, by condition (1), we have

tr[(φ(λA) − λφ(A))f (B)] = tr(λAg(B)) − λ tr(Ag(B)) = 0.

Hence φ(λA) = λφ(A) by condition (2). Similarly, we can obtain that φ(A1 + A2) = φ(A1) +
φ(A2)
(cid:3)

The following lemma will be used to prove Lemmas 2.3 and 2.4.

Lemma 2.2. Let A ∈ S, S = Mn, Hn, Sn, Dn. If tr(AB) = 0 for any invertible matrix B in
S, then A = 0.

Proof. Suppose A = (ajk) ∈ Mn. Let B = λIn + Ekj, where λ 6= 0, −1, λ ∈ R, and Ekj
denotes the matrix having a 1 in the (k, j)-th position and zeros elsewhere, 1 ≤ j, k ≤ n.
Then 0 = tr(AB) = λ tr(A) + ajk and hence ajk = 0 for all 1 ≤ j, k ≤ n. Thus A = 0.

Let A = (ajk) ∈ S. Similarly, if S = Sn, then we can choose B = λIn + Ejk + Ekj, where
λ 6= 0, ±1, −2, 1 ≤ j, k ≤ n to obtain A = 0. In addition, if S = Dn, then we can choose
B = λIn + Ejj, where λ 6= 0, 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ n to derive A = 0. Finally, if S = Hn, then we can
choose B = λIn + Ejk + Ekj, where λ 6= 0, ±1, −2, 1 ≤ j, k ≤ n to obtain ajk + akj = 0. On
the other hand, let B = λIn + iEjk + Ekj, where λ 6= 0, −1, λ ∈ R, 1 ≤ j 6= k ≤ n to derive
ajk + iakj = 0. Hence we can deduce that A = 0.
(cid:3)

Now we present Lemmas 2.3 and 2.4 which will be applied in the following sections. Firstly,

we consider the cases Mn, Sn and Tn.

Lemma 2.3. Let (A, C) be (Mn, Mn), (Sn, Sn), or (Tn, Dn). Let φ : A → C be a map sending
invertible matrices in A into invertible matrices in C. Suppose φ satisfy one of the following
conditions.

(1) tr(φ(A) · φ(B)−1) = tr(A · B−1),
(2) tr(φ(A) · φ(B)) = tr(A · B),

∀ A ∈ A, invertible matrix B ∈ A.

∀ A ∈ A, invertible matrix B ∈ A.

Then φ is linear. Moreover, φ is bijective if A = Mn or Sn.

Proof. (1) Suppose φ satisﬁes tr(A · B−1) = tr(φ(A) · φ(B)−1).

A = Mn or Sn: First of all, select a basis {B1, B2, . . . , BN } of invertible matrices in A,
)−1 : 1 ≤ j ≤ N } are linearly independent in

where N = dim A. Then we claim that {φ(B−1

By Lemma 2.2,P1≤j≤N λjBj = 0 and hence all λj = 0. Thus the set {φ(B−1

)−1 : 1 ≤ j ≤
N } is linearly independent and spans A. Suppose C ∈ A, for any invertible matrix A ∈ A,
tr(Cφ(A)−1) = 0. Then for any invertible B ∈ A, tr(CB) = 0. By Lemma 2.2 again, C = 0.
Therefore, φ is linear by Lemma 2.1 with f (B) = φ(B)−1 and g(B) = B−1.

Now we want to prove that φ is injective. Assume φ(A) = 0 for some A ∈ A. Then for any
invertible B in A, tr(AB−1) = tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1) = 0. By Lemma 2.2, we have A = 0. Thus φ
is injective and hence φ is bijective.

A = Tn: Similarly, we can select an invertible basis {B1, B2, . . . , Bn} of Dn, and using

Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 to prove that φ is linear.

(2) Suppose φ satisﬁes tr(A · B) = tr(φ(A) · φ(B)). Similarly, let f (B) = φ(B) and
(cid:3)

g(B) = B, we can apply Lemma 2.1 with Lemma 2.2 to prove that φ is linear.

For the case Pn, we have an analogous result.

Lemma 2.4. Let φ : Pn → Pn be a map. Suppose φ satisﬁes one of the following conditions.

(1) tr(φ(A) · φ(B)−1) = tr(A · B−1),
(2) tr(φ(A) · φ(B)) = tr(A · B),

∀ A, B ∈ Pn.

∀ A, B ∈ Pn.

Then φ is injective, additive and φ satisﬁes φ(λA) = λφ(A) for all A ∈ Pn, λ ∈ R+.

Proof. (1) Suppose φ satisﬁes tr(φ(A) · φ(B)−1) = tr(A · B−1). We extend φ to a map

maximal real linearly independent subset {Si : 1 ≤ i ≤ n2} of Pn. Then {Si : 1 ≤ i ≤ n2} is a

eφ : Hn → Hn that satisﬁes tr(eφ(A) · φ(B)−1) = tr(A · B−1) for A ∈ Hn, B ∈ Pn. Fix a
real basis of Hn. For A ∈ Pn, we deﬁne eφ(A) = φ(A). For A ∈ Hn \ Pn, suppose A =
we deﬁne eφ(A) =
ciφ(Si). Then eφ satisﬁes the desired property. In addition, suppose
C ∈ Hn with tr(CB) = 0 for any B ∈ Pn. Then for any eB ∈ Hn, it can be expressed as
eB = B1 − B2 for some B1, B2 ∈ Pn. Thus tr(CeB) = 0 and hence C = 0 by Lemma 2.2.
By similar argument in the proof of Lemma 2.3, we can show that eφ is linear and injective.

Therefore, φ is injective, additive and satisﬁes φ(λA) = λφ(A) for any A ∈ Pn and λ ∈ R+
by Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2.

3. Maps preserving determinants of convex combinations on Pn

The aim of the present section is to prove the following theorem.

Theorem 3.1. Let φ : Pn → Pn be a map and α = det φ(I)1/n. Then the following statements
are equivalent.

(1) There exists an invertible matrix M ∈ Mn with det(M ∗M ) = 1 such that φ is either

φ(A) = αM ∗AM

∀ A ∈ Pn

or

φ(A) = αM ∗AtM

∀ A ∈ Pn.

(2)

det(φ(A) + φ(B)) = αn det(A + B),

A, B ∈ Pn.

(3.1)

(3) tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1),

A, B ∈ Pn.

Proof. It is easy to see that (1) ⇒ (2) and (1) ⇒ (3).

(2) ⇒ (1): Deﬁne ψ : Pn → Pn by ψ(A) = φ(I)−1/2φ(A)φ(I)−1/2. Then we can see that
det φ(I) det(φ(A) + φ(B)) = det(A + B). Hence by (2)
ψ is unital and det(ψ(A) + ψ(B)) =
⇒ (1) of Lemma 3.2 (see below), there exists a unitary matrix U ∈ Mn such that ψ is either
ψ(A) = U ∗AU or ψ(A) = U ∗AtU . Hence φ is either φ(A) = αM ∗AM or φ(A) = αM ∗AtM ,
where M = α−1/2U φ(I)1/2 and det(M ∗M ) = det(α−1φ(I)) = α−n det(φ(I)) = 1.

1

(3) ⇒ (1): Deﬁne ψ : Pn → Pn by ψ(A) = φ(I)−1/2φ(A)φ(I)−1/2. Then we can see that ψ

is unital and

tr(ψ(A) · ψ(B)−1) = tr(φ(I)−1/2φ(A)φ(B)−1φ(I)1/2)

= tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1φ(I)1/2φ(I)−1/2)
= tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1)

for A, B ∈ Pn. Hence by Lemma 3.2 again, there exists a unitary matrix U ∈ Mn such that
ψ is either ψ(A) = U ∗AU or ψ(A) = U ∗AtU . Similar to the proof (2) ⇒ (1), our assertion
follows.
(cid:3)

Now we present Lemma 3.2, which plays an important role in the proof of Theorem 3.1.

Lemma 3.2. Let φ : Pn → Pn be a unital map. Then the following statements are equivalent.

(1) There exists a unitary matrix U ∈ Mn such that φ is either
φ(A) = U ∗AtU

φ(A) = U ∗AU

∀ A ∈ Pn

or

∀ A ∈ Pn.

(2) det(φ(A) + φ(B)) = det(A + B),
(3) tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1),
(4) tr(φ(A)φ(B)) = tr(AB),

A, B ∈ Pn.

A, B ∈ Pn.

A, B ∈ Pn.

To prove Lemma 3.2 we need some auxiliary lemmas. Firstly, we need the well-known

Minkowski’s determinant inequality ([8, Theorem 7.8.8]).

6

HUAJUN HUANG, CHIH-NENG LIU, PATR´ICIA SZOKOL, MING-CHENG TSAI†, JUN ZHANG

Lemma 3.3. Let A, B ∈ Pn. Then

[det(A + B)]1/n ≥ (det A)1/n + (det B)1/n,

A, B ∈ Pn,

and the equality holds if and only if B = λA for some λ > 0.

Using Lemma 3.3 we can show that every transformation that preserves the determinant of
the convex combination with parameter t = 1/2 also preserves it with an arbitrary parameter.

Lemma 3.4. Let φ : Pn → Pn be a map such that

det(φ(A) + φ(B)) = det(A + B),

A, B ∈ Pn.

Then φ(λA) = λφ(A) for all A ∈ Pn, λ > 0 and

det(tφ(A) + (1 − t)φ(B)) = det(tA + (1 − t)B)

A, B ∈ Pn, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

Proof. Taking A = B, one has det A = det φ(A). Hence by assumption, we have

[det(φ(A) + φ(λA))]1/n = [det(A + λA)]1/n

= (1 + λ)[det A]1/n = [det A]1/n + [det λA]1/n

= [det φ(A)]1/n + [det φ(λA)]1/n

for any λ > 0. Thus by Lemma 3.3, we can get φ(λA) = aφ(A) for some a > 0. Since
det A = det φ(A), we obtain that

λn det A = det(λA) = det(φ(λA)) = det(aφ(A)) = an det A

Thus a = λ and hence φ satisﬁes φ(λA) = λφ(A) for every λ > 0. Therefore,

det(φ(A) + λφ(B)) = det(φ(A) + φ(λB)) = det(A + λB)

for every λ > 0. Hence for 0 < t ≤ 1, A, B ∈ Pn,

det(tA + (1 − t)B) = tn det(cid:18)A +(cid:18) 1 − t
= tn det(cid:18)φ(A) +

t

t (cid:19) B(cid:19)

1 − t

φ(B)(cid:19) = det(tφ(A) + (1 − t)φ(B)).

(cid:3)

Next, we recall a useful lemma which shows that the derivative of the determinant can be

written with the help of trace.

Lemma 3.5 ([7, Main Theorem]). Let U be an open subset of the reals. Let A(t) be a
diﬀerentiable matrix valued function on U . Then d(t) ≡ det A(t) is diﬀerentiable and satisﬁes

dt(t) = tr[AdjA(t) · At(t)], t ∈ U.

In the following lemma we collect some trace-equalities that are equivalent.

TRACE AND DETERMINANT PRESERVING MAPS OF MATRICES

Lemma 3.6. Let φ : Mn → Mn be an unital linear map and φ(Pn) ⊆ Pn. Then the following
statements are equivalent.

(1) There exists a unitary matrix U ∈ Mn such that φ is either

φ(A) = U ∗AU

∀ A ∈ Pn

or

φ(A) = U ∗AtU

∀ A ∈ Pn.

(2) tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1),
(3) tr(φ(A)2) = tr(A2),
(4) tr(φ(A)φ(B)) = tr(AB),

A ∈ Pn.

A, B ∈ Pn.

A, B ∈ Pn.

Proof. Since φ(Pn) ⊆ Pn and φ is linear on Mn, we know that φ is continuous and hence
φ(M +

n ), φ(Hn) ⊆ φ(Hn).

n ) ⊆ φ(M +

(1) ⇒ (2): It is trivial.

(2) ⇒ (3): Take B = I in the assumption. Then we have tr(A) = tr(φ(A)) for any A ∈ Pn.
Note that for any A ∈ Pn, by Choi’s inequality ([3, Corollary 2.3]), φ(A)−1 ≤ φ(A−1). That
is, φ(A−1)−1 ≤ φ(A). Hence

tr(A2) = tr(A(A−1)−1) = tr(φ(A)φ(A−1)−1) = tr(φ(A)1/2φ(A−1)−1φ(A)1/2) ≤ tr(φ(A)2).

By Kadison’s inequality ([9, p. 495]), φ(A)2 ≤ φ(A2). Therefore, we have

tr(A2) ≤ tr(φ(A)2) ≤ tr(φ(A2)) = tr(A2).

This implies that tr(φ(A)2) = tr(A2).

(3) ⇒ (4): For any A, B ∈ Pn, tr((A + B)2) = tr(A2) + tr(B2) + 2 tr(AB) and tr((φ(A) +
φ(B))2) = tr(φ(A)2) + tr(φ(B)2) + 2 tr(φ(A)φ(B)). Hence by assumption, we have tr(AB) =
tr(φ(A)φ(B)).

(4) ⇒ (1): Taking B = I we have that tr(φ(A)) = tr(A). Since φ(M +

n ) ⊆ φ(M +

n ), by

Kadison’s inequality, φ(A)2 ≤ φ(A2) for any A > 0. Hence

tr(A2) = tr(φ(A)2) ≤ tr(φ(A2)) = tr(A2).

Thus tr(φ(A2) − φ(A)2) = 0. By the inequality φ(A2) ≥ φ(A)2 again, this implies that
φ(A2) = φ(A)2 for any A > 0. For any A ∈ Hn, there exists ǫ > 0 such that A + ǫI > 0
and hence φ((A + ǫI)2) = φ(A + ǫI)2. This implies that φ(A2) = φ(A)2. Now for any
A = A1 + iA2 ∈ Mn for some A1, A2 ∈ Hn, we have φ(A1 + A2)2 = φ((A1 + A2)2) =
φ(A2
2+A1A2+A2A1). This implies that φ(A1A2)+φ(A2A1) = φ(A1)φ(A2)+φ(A2)φ(A1).
2)+iφ(A1A2 +A2A1) = φ(A1)2 −φ(A2)2 +iφ(A1)φ(A2)+
Hence φ((A1 +iA2)2) = φ(A2
iφ(A2)φ(A1) = (φ(A1)+iφ(A2))2 = φ(A1 +iA2)2. In addition, since φ(Hn) ⊆ φ(Hn), we have
φ(A∗) = φ(A1)−iφ(A2) = (φ(A1)+iφ(A2))∗ = φ(A)∗. Hence φ is a Jordan ∗-homomorphism.

1)−φ(A2

1+A2

Moreover, by the proof of Lemma 2.4, we can see that the complex span of {φ(Si) : 1 ≤
i ≤ n2} is Mn, where {Si : 1 ≤ i ≤ n2} is a ﬁxed maximal real linearly independent subset of
Pn. It means that φ is surjective and hence injective since φ is linear on Mn. Therefore, φ is

8

HUAJUN HUANG, CHIH-NENG LIU, PATR´ICIA SZOKOL, MING-CHENG TSAI†, JUN ZHANG

a Jordan ∗-isomorphism on Mn. Hence φ(A) = U AU ∗ for all A ∈ Pn or φ(A) = U AT U ∗ for
all A ∈ Pn.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.7. The assumption “φ is linear” of Lemma 3.6 is necessary for the condition (3).
In fact, we can deﬁne the map φ : Mn → Mn by φ(A) = U (s)AU (s)∗ for all A ∈ Mn with
kAk = s, where U (s) is a unitary matrix depending on the norm of A. Thus it is easy to
check that φ(Pn) ⊆ Pn and tr(φ(A)2) = tr(A2). However, φ is not linear and doesn’t satisfy
the condition (1) in Lemma 3.6.

Now, we are in a position to prove Lemma 3.2.

Proof of Lemma 3.2. It is easy to see (1) ⇒ (2).

(2) ⇒ (3): By Lemma 3.4, we have for any A, B ∈ Pn, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1

det(tA + (1 − t)B) = det(tφ(A) + (1 − t)φ(B)).

Hence Lemma 3.5 implies that

d
dt

det(tA + (1 − t)B)|t=0+ =

d

det(B + t(A − B))|t=0+

= tr[(Adj(B) + t(A − B))(A − B)]|t=0+ = tr[Adj(B)(A − B)]
= tr(A · Adj(B)) − tr(B · Adj(B)) = tr(A · Adj(B)) − tr[det B · In]

= tr(A · Adj(B)) − n · det B.

Similarly, we have

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

d
dt

det(tφ(A) + (1 − t)φ(B))|t=0+ = tr(φ(A) · Adj(φ(B))) − n · det φ(B).

(3.6)

Choosing A = B in (3.1), then we obtain det(φ(B)) = det(B) for all B ∈ Pn. Hence by (3.5),
(3.6) and assumption, the equality

tr(A · Adj(B)) = tr(φ(A) · Adj(φ(B)))

A, B ∈ Pn

holds. Hence for all A, B ∈ Pn, we have

tr(A · B−1) = tr(cid:18)A ·

Adj(B)

det(B)(cid:19) = tr(cid:18)φ(A) ·

Adj(φ(B))

det(φ(B))(cid:19) = tr(φ(A) · φ(B)−1).

n → M +

(3) ⇒ (4): By Lemma 2.4, we can obtain that φ is additive and positive homogeneous,
that is, φ(A + B) = φ(A) + φ(B) and φ(λA) = λφ(A) for all A, B ∈ Pn, λ > 0. Firstly, for
any A ≥ 0, deﬁne φ1 : M +
φ(A + ǫI). Then we can see that φ1 is
well-deﬁned, φ1(A + B) = φ1(A) + φ1(B) and φ1(λA) = λφ1(A) for all A, B ∈ M +
n , λ ≥ 0.
Secondly, for any A ∈ Mn, there exist A1, A2, A3, A4 ≥ 0 such that A = A1 − A2 + iA3 − iA4.
Then we can deﬁne φ2 : Mn → Mn by φ2(A) = φ1(A1) − φ1(A2) + iφ1(A3) − iφ1(A4). Then
one can check that φ2 is well-deﬁned, linear, unital and φ2(A) = φ(A) for any A ∈ Pn. Hence
our assertion follows from (2)⇒ (4) of Lemma 3.6.

(4) ⇒ (1): By applying Lemma 2.4 and the similar proof (3) ⇒ (4) in this lemma, we can
deﬁne a unital linear map φ3 : Mn → Mn satisfying φ3(A) = φ(A) for any A ∈ Pn. Hence by
(4)⇒ (1) of Lemma 3.6, there exists a unitary matrix U ∈ Mn such that φ is either

φ(A) = U ∗AU

∀ A ∈ Pn

or

φ(A) = U ∗AtU

∀ A ∈ Pn.

4. Maps preserving determinants of convex combinations on Sn

We consider the Sn case in this section. In 2004, Cao and Tang studied this kind of problem
and obtained some results in [2, Theorems 1.1 and 1.2]. Now we add the trace equality and
reformulate the result as follows.

Theorem 4.1. Let φ : Sn → Sn be a map and αn = det φ(I). Then the following statements
are equivalent.

(1) There exists an invertible matrix P ∈ Sn with (det P )2 = 1 such that φ is of the form

φ(A) = αP AP t

∀ A ∈ Sn.

(2) φ sends invertible matrices in Sn into invertible matrices in Sn and

tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1)

for all A ∈ Sn and invertible matrix B ∈ Sn.

(3)

det(tφ(A) + (1 − t)φ(B)) = αn det(tA + (1 − t)B),

A, B ∈ Sn, t ∈ [0, 1]

(4) φ is surjective and there exist two speciﬁc t ∈ [0, 1] such that

det(tφ(A) + (1 − t)φ(B)) = αn det(tA + (1 − t)B),

A, B ∈ Sn.

The implications (1) ⇔ (3) and (1) ⇔ (4) are slight modiﬁcations of Cao and Tang’s results
in [2, Theorems 1.1 and 1.2]. Here we give another equivalent condition (1) ⇔ (2) which is
not trivial to see.

Proof. It is easy to check (1) ⇒ (2). We only need to prove (2) ⇒ (1).

(2) ⇒ (1): Since φ(I) ∈ Sn, there exists an invertible matrix Q ∈ Sn such that φ(I) = QQt.
Deﬁne ψ : Sn → Pn by ψ(A) = Q−1φ(A)(Q−1)t. Then we can see that ψ is unital
and ψ sends invertible matrices into invertible matrices. Moreover, tr(ψ(A)ψ(B)−1) =
tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1) for A ∈ Sn and invertible B ∈ Sn. By Lemma 4.2 (see be-
low), there exists an orthogonal matrix P ∈ Mn such that ψ(A) = P AP t for A ∈ Sn.
Hence φ(A) = Qψ(A)Qt = αRARt, where R = α−1/2QP is invertible with (det R)2 =
α−n det(QQt) det(P )2 = α−n det φ(I) = 1.
(cid:3)

For the proof of Theorem 4.1, we should apply the following lemma.

Lemma 4.2. Let φ : Sn → Sn be an unital map sending invertible matrices into invertible
matrices. Then the following statements are equivalent.

(1) There exists an orthogonal matrix P ∈ Mn such that φ is of the form

φ(A) = P AP t

∀ A ∈ Sn.

(2) tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1),
(3) tr(φ(A)φ(B)k) = tr(ABk),

A ∈ Sn and invertible B ∈ Sn.

A, B ∈ Sn and k ∈ N.

The proof of (3) ⇒ (1) in Lemma 4.2 below follows from the analogous idea in Section 3.

Proof of Lemma 4.2. (1) ⇒ (2): It is trivial.

(2) ⇒ (3): By Lemma 2.3, φ is linear. By assumption and φ(I) = I, for small enough |λ|

we have tr(A(I − λB)−1) = tr(φ(A)(I − λφ(B))−1). Hence for any A, B ∈ Sn

Xk

tr(ABk)λk =Xk

tr(φ(A)φ(B)k)λk.

Thus tr(ABk) = tr(φ(A)φ(B)k).

(3) ⇒ (1): By Lemma 2.3 and φ(I) = I, we have that φ is linear, bijective and tr(A) =

tr(φ(A)). Note that for any polynomial p(z) =Pk=1 akzk, by assumption,
tr([p(φ(A))−φ(p(A))]φ(B)) =Xk

ak tr([φ(A)k−φ(Ak)]φ(B)) =Xk

ak(tr(AkB)−tr(AkB)) = 0.

Since φ is surjective, by Lemma 2.2, we have

p(φ(A)) = φ(p(A)).

ii) and tr(φ(Dij)k) = tr(Dk

Let Dij = Eij + Eji for i 6= j. Then φ(Eii)2 = φ(E2
ij) =
ij ) = φ((Eii + Ejj)Dij) = φ(Dij ). Since tr(φ(Eii)k) =
φ(Eii) + φ(Ejj), and φ(Dij)3 = φ(D3
tr(Ek
ij) for all k, by [8, p.44, Problem 12], φ(Eii) and Eii (resp.,
φ(Dij ) and Dij have the same eigenvalues counting multiplicities. Moreover, all of them are
diagonalizable. Therefore, rank φ(Eii) = 1 and rank φ(Dij) = 2. Expanding this equality
φ[(Eii + Ejj)2] = [φ(Eii + Ejj)]2 = [φ(Eii) + φ(Ejj)]2, we have φ(Eii) + φ(Ejj) = φ(Eii)2 +
φ(Ejj)2 + φ(Eii)φ(Ejj) + φ(Ejj)φ(Eii). Hence

ii) = φ(Eii), φ(Dij )2 = φ(D2

φ(Eii)φ(Ejj) = −φ(Ejj)φ(Eii).

Multiplying by φ(Ejj) in the both sides and using that φ(Ejj)2 = φ(Ejj), we have this equality
[In +φ(Ejj)]φ(Eii)φ(Ejj) = 0. Since In +φ(Ejj) is invertible, we can obtain φ(Eii)φ(Ejj) = 0.
Thus by [8, p.216, Problem 24], there exists a complex orthogonal matrix Q ∈ Mn such that
φ(Eii) = QtEiiQ. Replacing φ(A) with Qφ(A)Qt, we may assume φ(Eii) = Eii. Hence
φ(Dij )2 = Eii + Ejj and φ(Dij) = φ(Dij)3 = (Eii + Ejj)φ(Dij ) = φ(Dij )(Eii + Ejj). Thus

[φ(Dij)]pq = 0

∀p 6= i, j or q 6= i, j.

11

On the other hand, for any k,

[φ(Dij )]kk = tr(Ekkφ(Dij )) = tr(φ(Ekk)φ(Dij)) = tr(EkkDij) = 0.

Since φ(Dij) is symmetric, the above calculations show that φ(Dij ) = a(Eij + Eji), a 6= 0.
Hence φ(Dij) = Dij or −Dij since φ(Dij)2 = Eii + Ejj. Suppose n = 2 and φ(D12) = −D12.

Replacing φ(A) with  1

0 −1 ! φ(A)  1

0

0

0 −1 !, we may assume φ(D12) = D12. If n ≥ 3,

then similarly we may assume that φ(D1j ) = D1j for all j 6= 1. Suppose φ(Duv) = −Duv for
some u, v 6= 1 and u 6= v. Then one can see that tr φ((D1u + D1v + Duv)3) = tr(D1u + D1v +
Duv)3 = 6 and tr(φ(D1u + D1v + Duv))3 = tr(D1u + D1v − Duv)3 = −6. It is a contradiction
since tr φ(A3) = tr(φ(A))3 for A ∈ Sn. Hence φ(Dij ) = Dij for all i 6= j. Therefore, φ(A) = A
for all A ∈ Sn. This completes the proof.

5. Maps preserving determinants of convex combinations on Mn

In this section we consider the corresponding case on Mn. Similarly, we rewrite Tan and

Wang’s result ([14]) by supplementing the trace equality.

Theorem 5.1. Let φ : Mn → Mn be a map and αn = det φ(I). Then the following statements
are equivalent.

(1) There exist invertible matrices M, N ∈ Mn with det(M N ) = 1 such that φ is either

φ(A) = αM AN

∀ A ∈ Mn

or

φ(A) = αM AtN

∀ A ∈ Mn.

(2) φ sends invertible matrices into invertible matrices and

tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1)

for all A ∈ Mn and invertible matrix B ∈ Mn.

(3)

det(tφ(A) + (1 − t)φ(B)) = αn det(tA + (1 − t)B),

A, B ∈ Mn, t ∈ [0, 1]

(4) φ is surjective and there exist two speciﬁc t ∈ [0, 1] such that

det(tφ(A) + (1 − t)φ(B)) = αn det(tA + (1 − t)B),

A, B ∈ Mn.

Proof. By Tan and Wang’s result in [14, Theorems 1 and 2], one can show the implications
(1) ⇔ (3) and (1) ⇔ (4). It is easy to check (1) ⇒ (2) and hence we only need to prove (2)
⇒ (1).

(2) ⇒ (1): Deﬁne ψ : Mn → Mn by ψ(A) = φ(I)−1φ(A). Then we can see that ψ is
unital and ψ sends invertible matrices into invertible matrices. Moreover, tr(ψ(A)ψ(B)−1) =
tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1) for A ∈ Mn and invertible B ∈ Mn. By Lemma 2.3, ψ is
bijective and linear. Similar to the proof in Lemma 4.2, we have that p(ψ(A)) = ψ(p(A))
for any A ∈ Mn, polynomial p. Then ψ(Eii)2 = ψ(Eii) and ψ(Eii) are diagonalizable with

12

HUAJUN HUANG, CHIH-NENG LIU, PATR´ICIA SZOKOL, MING-CHENG TSAI†, JUN ZHANG

ψ(Eii)ψ(Ejj ) = 0, rank ψ(Eii) = 1. Hence there exists an invertible matrix P ∈ Mn such
that ψ(Eii) = P −1EiiP . Replacing ψ(A) with P ψ(A)P −1, we may assume ψ(Eii) = Eii. Let
Dij = Eij + Eji for i 6= j. Then ψ(Dij )2 = Eii + Ejj. Similar to the proof in Lemma 4.2,
we have ψ(Eij ) + ψ(Eji) = ψ(Dij ) = aEij + 1
a Eji. Let Sij = Eij − Eji. Similarly, we have
ψ(Eij ) − ψ(Eji) = ψ(Sij) = cEij − 1
c Eji. From the part (2) ⇒ (3) of the proof of Lemma 4.2
we also get that tr(ABk) = tr(ψ(A)ψ(B)k), k ∈ N. In particular,

tr[(ψ(Eij ) + ψ(Eji))(ψ(Eij ) − ψ(Eji))] = tr[(Eij + Eji)(Eij − Eji)] = 0,
c = 0 and hence c = a or c = −a. If c = a, then ψ(Eij) = aEij and ψ(Eji) = 1

a Eji.

we have c
If c = −a, then ψ(Eij ) = 1

a − a

a Eji and ψ(Eji) = aEij.

We claim that there are no pairwise distinct i, j, k such that ψ(Eij ) = aEij but ψ(Eik) =
b Eki. Otherwise, [ψ(Eij)+ψ(Eik)]2 = (aEij + 1
b Ekj and ψ[(Eij +Eik)2] = ψ(0) = 0.
It leads to a contradiction. Similarly, there are no pairwise distinct i, j, k such that ψ(Eij) =
1
a Eji but ψ(Ekj) = bEkj. Therefore, either ψ(Eij ) ∈ C⋆Eij for all i, j or ψ(Eij ) ∈ C⋆Eji for
all i, j. Here C⋆ = C \ {0}. Suppose ψ(Eij) = aijEij for all i, j. Since ψ[(Eij + Ej1)2] =
[ψ(Eij ) + ψ(E1j )]2, we have ai1Ei1 = (aijEij + aj1Ej1)2 = aijaj1Ei1. Hence aij = ai1
. Let
aj1
D = Diag(a11, a21, . . . , an1). Then ψ(A) = DAD−1 and hence

b Eki)2 = a

φ(A) = α(

α

φ(I)D)AD−1.

In addition, det( 1

α φ(I)DD−1) = 1

αn det φ(I) = 1.

Similarly, if ψ(Eij) = bijEji for all i, j, then ψ(A) = DAtD−1 for some diagonal matrix D.

Hence

φ(A) = α(

1
α

φ(I)D)AtD−1

with det( 1

α φ(I)DD−1) = 1. Our assertion follows.

6. Maps preserving determinants of convex combinations on Tn

In this section we add the trace equality to the case on Tn which have been studied by Tan

and Wang ([14]).

Theorem 6.1. Let φ : Tn → Tn be a map and αn = det φ(I). Then the following statements
are equivalent.

(1) There exist a permutation σ of degree n and λ1, . . ., λn with Qn

for all A ∈ Tn,

i=1 λi = 1 such that

[φ(A)]ii = αλiAσ(i)σ(i)

∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

(2) φ sends invertible matrices into invertible matrices and

tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1)

for all A ∈ Tn and invertible matrix B ∈ Tn.

TRACE AND DETERMINANT PRESERVING MAPS OF MATRICES

(3)

det(tφ(A) + (1 − t)φ(B)) = αn det(tA + (1 − t)B),

A, B ∈ Tn, t ∈ [0, 1]

(4) φ is surjective and there exist two speciﬁc t ∈ [0, 1] such that

det(tφ(A) + (1 − t)φ(B)) = αn det(tA + (1 − t)B),

A, B ∈ Tn.

Remark 6.2. Following the similar proofs in [14, Theorems 1’ and 2’], and Lemma 6.3 (see
below), one can show that Theorem 6.1 holds if Tn is replaced by Dn and φ : Tn → Tn is
replaced by φ : Dn → Dn.

To prove Theorem 6.1, we need the following lemma.

Lemma 6.3. Let φ : Tn → Tn be an unital map sending invertible matrices into invertible
matrices. Suppose tr(φ(A)φ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1) for A ∈ Tn and invertible B ∈ Tn. Then
there exists a permutation σ of degree n such that for all A ∈ Tn,

[φ(A)]ii = Aσ(i)σ(i)

∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Proof. As the idea in [14, Theorems 1’ and 2’], we can deﬁne ψ : Tn → Dn by ψ(A) =
Diagφ(A), where DiagA is the diagonal matrix having the same diagonal entries as A ∈ Tn.
Then it is easily to see that ψ is an unital map sending invertible matrices into invertible
matrices and ψ satisﬁes tr(ψ(A)ψ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1) for A ∈ Tn and invertible B ∈ Tn. By
Lemma 2.3, ψ is linear. Similar to the proof in Lemma 4.2, we have that tr(ψ(A)ψ(B)k) =
tr(ABk) for A, B ∈ Tn. Thus tr(ψ(A)k) = tr(Ak) for all k and hence by [8, p.44, Problem
12], ψ(A) and A have the same eigenvalues counting multiplicities. Since A ∈ Tn, ψ(A) ∈ Dn,
there exists a permutation σ of degree n such that ψ(A) = Diag(Aσ(1)σ(1), . . . , Aσ(n)σ(n)).
Therefore, [φ(A)]ii = Aσ(i)σ(i) for all i.
(cid:3)

We can now present the proof of Theorem 6.1.

Proof of Theorem 6.1. The implications (1) ⇔ (3) and (1) ⇔ (4) can be deduced by Tan and
Wang’s result in [14, Theorems 1’ and 2’]. It is easy to check (1) ⇒ (2). We only need to
prove (2) ⇒ (1).

(2) ⇒ (1): Deﬁne ψ : Tn → Tn by ψ(A) = φ(I)−1φ(A). Then ψ is an unital map sending
invertible matrices into invertible matrices and ψ satisﬁes tr(ψ(A)ψ(B)−1) = tr(AB−1) for
A ∈ Tn and invertible B ∈ Tn. Then by Lemma 6.3, there exists a permutation σ of degree
n such that for all A ∈ Tn, [ψ(A)]ii = Aσ(i)σ(i) for all i. Let λi = α−1[φ(I)]ii for all i. Then
(cid:3)

i=1 λi = α−n det(φ(I)) = 1.

[φ(A)]ii = αλiAσ(i)σ(i). In addition,Qn
