In 1992, Kalai and Kleitman proved a quasipolynomial upper bound on the diameters of convex poly-
hedra. Todd and Sukegawa-Kitahara proved tail-quasipolynomial bounds on the diameters of polyhedra.
These tail bounds apply when the number of facets is greater than a certain function of the dimension.
We prove tail-quasipolynomial bounds on the diameters of polytopes and normal simplicial complexes.
We also prove tail-polynomial upper bounds on the diameters of polyhedra.

Introduction

Diameter upper bounds for convex polyhedra provide lower bounds to the number of simplex iterations
needed for linear programming. Upper bounds for polytopes are generally similar, and are of interest in
their own right due to Santos’ counterexample (see [35]) to the Hirsch Conjecture. Recall that a polyhedron
is the intersection of a ﬁnite number of halfspaces and a polytope is the convex hull of a ﬁnite set of points,
thus a polytope is a bounded polyhedron. For a given polytope or polyhedron P , we use d to denote the
dimension of its aﬃne span and n to denote the number of (d− 1)-dimensional faces. The Hirsch Conjecture
asserted that the diameter of a polytope was at most n− d. The conjecture is false (see [31]) for n
2 = d ≥ 20.
History on the Hirsch Conjecture is given in [26], [27], or the survey [22]. Our terminology follows [16]
and [41].

The best known upper bounds on the diameters of convex polyhedra are the quasipolynomial bounds
given by Kalai and Kleitman (see [19]), with recent improvements by Todd (see [40]) and Sukegawa and
Kitahara (see [39]). For polytopes, there are several classical upper bounds on the diameters of polytopes
which are linear in the number n of facets of P given by Barnette (see [6] and [7]) and Larman (see [29]).

Recent research studies the diameters of abstract polytopes and related objects, following Adler et al.
in [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [18], [30], and [33]. Eisenbrand et al. (see [13]) introduced connected layer families
as a generalization of polyhedra. In [13], Eisenbrand et al. proved that the quasipolynomial upper bound
of Kalai and Kleitman in [19] applied to connected layer families. In [24], Kim generalized connected layer
families to arbitrary graphs, deﬁning subset partition graphs satisfying dimension reduction. Very recently,
combinatorial paths have been studied in normal simplicial complexes (see, e.g., [28] and [36]). Normal
simplicial complexes are studied in [9] and [24], which are subset partition graphs satisfying dimension
reduction in the dual setting.

In Section 2, we review previous diameter bounds. In Section 3, we present new tail-quasipolynomial
upper bounds for the diameters of polyhedra. In Section 4, we revisit Sukegawa and Kitahara’s (see [39]) tail-
quasipolynomial upper bound for the diameters of polytopes. In Section 5, we apply the recent techniques of
Todd and Sukegawa-Kitahara to obtain tail-quasipolynomial upper bounds for normal simplicial complexes.
Section 6 applies iterated recursion to a classical inequality of Kalai and Kleitman (see [19]) to obtain the
ﬁrst tail-polynomial bounds in Section 7. Our main result is Theorem 7.4, a tail-almost-linear upper bound
on the diameter of convex polyhedra when the number of facets is large. As with [39], our bounds are tail
bounds in that the presented inequalities apply when the number n of facets is greater than some function
of the dimension d. We conclude with ﬁnal remarks in Section 8.

2 Previous bounds

Let ∆b(d, n) denote the maximum diameter among d-dimensional polytopes with n facets for n > d. We use
∆u(d, n) to denote the maximum diameter of d-dimensional polyhedra with n facets when n ≥ d. Trivially,
∆b(d, n) ≤ ∆u(d, n) when both quantities are deﬁned.
In this article, we expand on the upper bound ∆u(d, n) ≤ (n − d)log2(d−1) if n ≥ d ≥ 3 by Sukegawa and
Kitahara (see [39]). As with the result ∆u(d, n) ≤ (n− d)log2 d if n ≥ d ≥ 1 by Todd in [40], their proof relies
on the recurrence relation

∆u(d, n) ≤ ∆u(d − 1, n − 1) + 2∆u(d,⌊n/2⌋) + 2 if n ≥ 2d

(1)

in [19] by Kalai-Kleitman. Their proof also uses the bound ∆b(d, n) ≤ 2d−3n in [29] by Larman which only
applies to bounded polyhedra, but the recent bound ∆u(d, n) ≤ 2d−3n from [28] applies.
Results will rely on upper bounds on the diameter which are linear in n for ﬁxed dimension d. The
following are upper bounds on the diameter of a bounded polytope which are linear in ﬁxed dimension. In
1969, Barnette (see [6]) proved ∆b(d, n) ≤ 3d−2n if n ≥ d ≥ 4. In 1970, Larman (see [29]) improved this
bound to ∆b(d, n) ≤ 2d−3n if n ≥ d ≥ 3. In 1974, Barnette (see [7]) improved the bound again: though
the abstract and ﬁnal corollary of [7] both state a bound of ∆b(d, n) ≤ 1
3 2d−3(n − d + 5
2 ) for n ≥ d ≥ 3,
3 2d−2(n − d + 5
the inequality does not hold, e.g., for the 3-cube. In fact, the proof gives ∆b(d, n) ≤ 1
2 ) if
n ≥ d ≥ 3, as stated in Theorem 1 of [7], which strictly improves Larman’s bound if and only if n + 2d > 5.
All three of these results deﬁne their object of study as the convex hull of a ﬁnite set of points, thus the
results apply to ∆b(d, n).

It would be interesting to ascertain if any of the statements in [6, 7, 29] apply to ∆u(d, n) with few
changes to the proof. (The deﬁnition of removable edges in [7] requires 3-regularity, which does not apply to
3-polyhedron graphs.) Until very recently, the only upper bound to ∆u(d, n) linear in n when d is ﬁxed was
∆u(d, n) ≤ ∆CLF (d, n) ≤ 2d−1n by Eisenbrand et al. in [13, Theorem 3.2], where ∆CLF (d, n) denotes the
maximum diameter of d-dimensional connected layer families with n symbols. In 2015, Labb´e, Manneville,
and Santos (see Theorem 3.5 in [28]) proved a bound on simplicial complexes which implies ∆u(d, n) ≤ 2d−3n,
matching Larman’s upper bound for ∆b(d, n) in [29].
The proofs and expositions in the literature interchange the known upper bounds for polytopes and
polyhedra. This type of inconsistency appears, e.g., in [22], which states [19] proves ∆b(d, n) ≤ n1+log2(d),
while true, the results of [13] and [19] prove the stronger statement ∆u(d, n) ≤ n1+log2(d). We note the
Kalai-Kleitman bound (1) holds for ∆b(d, n).

Lemma 2.1 (Labb´e, Manneville, Santos [28]). If n ≥ 2d, then

∆b(d, n) ≤ ∆b(d − 1, n − 1) + 2∆b(d,⌊n/2⌋) + 2.

(2)

Proof. The proof is given in the polar setting. Since ∆b(d, n) is maximized among simplicial polytopes, let
P be a simplicial d-polytope with n vertices. Let F + and F − be two facets of P . We want to bound the
dual-graph distance between F + and F −.

For each i = 0, 1, 2, . . .

let F +

i and F−i be the set of facets at distance at most i from F + and F −,
k and F−k have a vertex in
The vertex ﬁgure of P at v is a (d − 1)-polytope with at most n − 1 vertices, and the star of v shares a
facet with both F +

k−1 has at most n/2 vertices. Then P+ = conv(F +

Recent research has focused on combinatorial abstractions of polytopes and polyhedra, with the ﬁrst re-
sults due to Eisenbrand, H¨ahnle, Razborov, and Rothvoß (see [13]). Eisenbrand et al. introduced connected
layer families, a structure recording the vertex-facet incidences represented by sets of symbols, and abstract-
ing the concept of distances in so-called layers, which is based on the polyhedral property that every face of
a polyhedron has a connected graph. In [13], Eisenbrand et al. prove that the diameters of n

connected layer families with n symbols is in Ω(n2/ log n). Bogart and Kim extend the Ω(n2/ log n) result
in [9] to the case when a layer family also satisﬁes a combinatorial adjacency condition and a cardinality
condition, coming from the polyhedral property that two simple vertices in a d-dimensional polyhedron are
adjacent if and only if they share d− 1 facets. Similar incidence structures were studied by Santos in [36] and
by Labb´e et al. (see [28]) in the dual setting, where the connectedness property of layer families corresponds
to the condition that a pure (d−1)-dimensional simplicial complex is normal. In [28], Labb´e, Manneville, and
Santos prove that the diameter of (d − 1)-dimensional pure and normal pseudomanifolds without boundary
is at most 2d−3n.
As in [39] and [40], all logarithms are base 2 and we readily use the identity xlog(y) = ylog(x) for positive

reals x, y.

3 Upper bounds for diameters of polyhedra

Following [39] by Sukegawa and Kitahara, we recursively deﬁne a doubly-indexed sequence ˜∆u(d, n) for
n ≥ d ≥ 3 by the following:

˜∆u(d, n) =


n − 3
0
˜∆u(d − 1, n − 1)
˜∆u(d − 1, n − 1) + 2 ˜∆u(d,⌊n/2⌋) + 2 if 6 < 2d ≤ n.

if d = 3
if n = d > 3
if 3 < d < n < 2d

Since ∆u(3, n) ≤ n − 3 by [25, Theorem 2.4], the recursion (1) implies ∆u(d, n) ≤ ˜∆u(d, n) for n ≥ d ≥ 3.
The result below is due to Sukegawa and Kitahara (see [39]), which improves the bound of Todd (see [40]),
though we present a diﬀerent proof here to preview our results in Sections 4 and 5.
Theorem 3.1. If n ≥ d ≥ 3, then ∆u(d, n) ≤ (n − d)log(d−1).
Proof. Either d ∈ {3, 4} or d ≥ 5. If d = 3, then the stated bound of (n − 3)log(3−1) aligns with the known
bound of ∆u(3, n) ≤ n− 3 in [25] for all n ≥ 3. If d = 4, then Appendix A.1 shows ˜∆u(4, n) ≤ (n− 4)log(4−1)
for 4 ≤ n ≤ 45 and [13] implies ∆u(4, n) ≤ 24−1n ≤ (n − 4)log(4−1) for n ≥ 46.
Suppose d ≥ 5. The cases when n < 2d follow from monotonicity, so we assume n ≥ 2d. Appendix A.1
also checks ˜∆u(d, n) ≤ (n − d)log(d−1) holds in the cases when 2d ≤ n < d + 8. Thus, we assume d ≥ 5 and
n − d ≥ 8, which implies log(n − d) ≥ 3. Then,

∆u(d, n) ≤ ∆u(d − 1, n − 1) + 2 · ∆u(d,⌊n/2⌋) + 2

As a corollary, this easily implies that H¨ahnle’s conjectured upper bound of (n − 1)d in [17] holds for
n − d ≤ 4, since (n − d)log(d−1) ≤ 4log(d−1) = (d − 1)2 ≤ (n − 1)d. Sukegawa and Kitahara (see [39]) also
proved that if d = 4 and n ≥ 9, or d ≥ 5 and n ≥ d + 3, then ∆u(d, n) ≤ (n − d − 1)log(d−1). As with
Theorem 3.1, this result is a tail bound.

4 Upper bounds for diameters of polytopes

In this section, we prove an upper bound on ∆b(d, n) using inequality (2) and Theorem 2.1 in [22], which
gives the tight bound ∆b(3, n) ≤ ⌊ 2n

3 ⌋ − 1, originally due to Klee in [25].

We recursively deﬁne a doubly-indexed sequence ˜∆b(d, n) for n ≥ d ≥ 3 by the following:

˜∆b(d, n) =

if d = 3
if n = d > 3
if 3 < d < n < 2d
if 6 < 2d ≤ n.

3 ⌋ − 1, the recursion (2) implies ∆b(d, n) ≤ ˜∆b(d, n) for n > d ≥ 3. By focusing on

Since ∆b(3, n) ≤ ⌊ 2n
polytopes, a bound similar to Theorem 3.1 with improved leading coeﬃcient holds.
Theorem 4.1. If n > d ≥ 3, then ∆b(d, n) ≤ [ 2
Proof. If d = 3, then by [22], ∆b(3, n) ≤ ⌊ 2n
The cases when n < 2d follow from monotonicity, so we assume n ≥ 2d. Suppose 4 ≤ d ≤ 10. Ap-
pendix A.2 checks the inequality holds when 4 ≤ d ≤ 10 and 2d ≤ n ≤ d + 10. Since d ≥ 11 and
2d ≤ n ≤ d + 10 cannot hold, we have veriﬁed all cases when n ≤ d + 10 for all d.

Bremner et al., and ∆b(n, d) ≤ n − d if n − d ≤ 6 in [11].

5 Upper bounds for normal simplicial complexes

In this section, we study the diameters of pure (d − 1)-dimensional normal simplicial complexes with the
pseudomanifold property. Kalai and Kleitman proved that normal simplicial complexes satisfy the Kalai-
Kleitman recursion, and this work was extended by Eisenbrand et al. (see [13]) to the setting of connected
layer families:

Theorem 5.1 ([13], [18]). The dual diameter of pure (d − 1)-dimensional normal simplicial complexes is at
most n1+log(d).

In [28], Labb´e, Manneville, and Santos prove the diameter is linear in ﬁxed dimension, the analogue

of [6, 7, 29].

Theorem 5.2 (Labb´e, Manneville, Santos [28]). The dual diameter of (d− 1)-dimensional pure and normal
pseudomanifolds without boundary is at most 2d−3n.

Let Σ(d, n) denote the maximum dual diameter of pure (d − 1)-dimensional normal simplicial complexes
which are pseudomanifolds without boundary. We recursively deﬁne a doubly-indexed sequence ˜Σ(d, n) for
n ≥ d ≥ 2 by the following:

˜Σ(d, n) =


⌊ n

˜Σ(d − 1, n − 1) + 2 ˜Σ(d,⌊n/2⌋) + 2 if 4 < 2d ≤ n.

if d = 2
if n = d > 2
if 2 < d ≤ n < 2d

2⌋, the normal property implies Σ(d, n) ≤ ˜Σ(d, n) for n ≥ d ≥ 2. We use the technique of

Since Σ(2, n) ≤ ⌊ n
Sukegawa and Kitahara (see [39]) to prove the following.
Theorem 5.3. If n > d ≥ 4, then Σ(d, n) ≤ (n − d)log(d).
Proof. If d = 4, then Appendix A.3 shows ˜Σ(4, n) ≤ (n − 4)log(4) for 4 < n ≤ 15 and Theorem 5.2 implies
Σ(4, n) ≤ 24−1n ≤ (n− 4)log(4) for n ≥ 16. Suppose d ≥ 5. The cases when n < 2d follow from monotonicity,
so we assume n ≥ 2d. Appendix A.3 also checks ˜Σ(d, n) ≤ (n−d)log(d) holds in the cases when 2d ≤ n < d+8.
Thus, we assume d ≥ 5 and n − d ≥ 8, which implies log(n − d) ≥ 3. Then,

Iterating the Kalai-Kleitman inequality

In this section, we prove several intermediate bounds on the diameters of polyhedra which will be needed in
Section 7. In addition to the inequality (1) due to Kalai and Kleitman, we will need two other previously-
known inequalities.

The ﬁrst inequality is trivially derived from Proposition 2.9a in [27], which states if n > d > 1, then
∆u(d, n) ≤ ∆u(d, n + 1)− 1. By reindexing, ∆u(d− 1, n− 1) ≤ ∆u(d− 1, n)− 1 if n > d > 2. The inequality
also holds in the case n = d, because the (d− 1)-polyhedron Pd−1 = {x ∈ Rd−1
j=1 xj ≥ 1} with d facets
has diameter one. Thus,
(3)
∆u(d − 1, n − 1) ≤ ∆u(d − 1, n) − 1 if n ≥ d ≥ 3.

≥0 |Pd−1

Our second inequality is even more trivial. In the case when n < 2d, the recursive bound

∆u(d, n) ≤ ∆u(d − 1, n − 1)

(4)

holds by the observation that any two vertices lie on a common facet. As in [41], one may iteratively apply
inequality (4) until the number of facets is no longer less than twice the dimension. If n ≥ 2d, one must turn
to inequality (1), whose recursive formula is not known. In the following lemma, we analyze the analogous
iterative process for n ≥ 2d.
Lemma 6.1. For d ≥ 3, k ≥ 0 integer, and d · 2k ≤ n < d · 2k+1,

∆u(d, n) ≤

2i∆u(d − 1,⌊n/2i⌋) − 1.

(5)

Proof. Let d ≥ 3 be ﬁxed. We proceed by induction on k. If k = 0, then d ≤ n < 2d, so by (3) and (4),
∆u(d, n) ≤ ∆u(d − 1, n − 1) ≤ ∆u(d − 1, n) − 1, which is the right side of (5). Assume that (5) holds for
k ≥ 0. Let d · 2k+1 ≤ n < d · 2k+2. Then d · 2k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋ < d · 2k+1. By our hypothesis and (1),

∆u(d, n) ≤ ∆u(d − 1, n − 1) + 2∆u(d,⌊n/2⌋) + 2

Therefore, the resulting bound (5) holds by induction.

For d = 4, this bound aligns with the upper bound ˜∆u(4, n) mentioned in Section 3. The Kalai-Kleitman
recursion has had the following long-standing geometric interpretation: Given two arbitrary vertices u and
v in the graph G of a polyhedron P , there is a subgraph Gu of G incident to n
2 facets, a subgraph Gv of G
incident to n
2 facets and a common facet F containing vertices u′ and v′ incident to Gu and Gv, respectively.
The eﬃciency of the bound on ∆u(d, n) in the previous lemma comes from applying the same inequality
inductively for the paths from u to u′ and from v to v′.

which in turn can be shown by induction on k, or by expanding and regrouping. The second equality is

The following theorem is a reﬁnement of the statement ∆u(d, 2k) ≤ 2k(cid:0)k+d
Theorem 6.4. For n ≥ d ≥ 3,

7 Tail-polynomial bounds for polyhedra

In this section, we present successively sharper tail-polynomial upper bounds on the diameters of convex
polyhedra. Our ﬁrst bound is cubic in the number n of facets.
Theorem 7.1. For d ≥ 3 and n ≥ 2d−1,

∆u(d, n) ≤

Proof. Let d ≥ 3 and n ≥ 2d−1 so that d − 3 ≤ ⌊log n/4⌋. By Theorem 6.4 and Stirling’s approximation,

∆u(d, n) ≤ (n − 3)(cid:18)⌊log n

This result improves to a tail-subcubic bound by using a direct upper bound on the binomial coeﬃcient

from Theorem 6.4 instead of using the central binomial coeﬃcient.

Theorem 7.2. Let ε > 0 and d ≥ 3. For suﬃciently large n,
∆u(d, n) ≤ n1+ 1

ln 2 +ε.

Proof. Let d ≥ 3. Suppose n ≥ 21+ d−3

2ε−1 . Then 2ε > 0 and d − 3 ≤ (2ε − 1)⌊log n⌋. Using Theorem 6.4,

∆u(d, n) ≤ (n − 3)(cid:18)⌊log n

If n is much larger than d, then the binomial coeﬃcient (cid:0)⌊log n⌋+d−3
(cid:1) is found near the boundary of
Pascal’s triangle. The following lemma shows that this binomial coeﬃcient is small (relative to n) if d − 3 is
much smaller than n.

⌊log n⌋

Lemma 7.3. Let ε > 0 and let d ≥ 3 be given. For suﬃciently large n,

Proof. Fix ε > 0 and let s = max{ 64

The previous lemma implies the following tail-almost-linear diameter upper bound for polyhedra.

, then

Proof. Fix ε > 0 and d ≥ 3. Let n ≥ 232d/ε2

∆u(d, n) ≤ n1+ε.

Corollary 7.5. For ε > 0, d ≥ 3, and n ≥ 232d/ε2

, one has ∆b(d, n) ≤ ∆u(d, n) ≤ n1+ε.

8 Concluding remarks

It is not likely that one can obtain better than tail-polynomial bounds for diameters of polyhedra using just
the Kalai-Kleitman inequality. (See the discussion in [41]).

We note that the results of Theorems 7.1, 7.2, and 7.4 are not proofs of the Polynomial Hirsch Conjecture,
which asserts there is a polynomial g(d, n) in d and n such that for all n ≥ d, one has ∆u(d, n) ≤ g(d, n).
However, we emphasize that these are tail results in the sense that for each d, the graph of the function
n 7→ ∆u(d, n) is eventually below the graph of g(n) = n1+ε, which gives very strong evidence for the
Polynomial Hirsch Conjecture, and even the Linear Hirsch Conjecture, though an inequality much stronger

10

than (3) is needed to apply extrapolation to obtain good bounds for ∆u(d, n) when n is small. Especially in
light of Theorem 7.4, it would be very surprising if the Polynomial Hirsch Conjecture were false.

The bounds in Theorems 7.1, 7.2, and 7.4 have expressions which are uniform in d, though the initial
value for which the tail bound applies is exponential in d. These results may demonstrate the limitations
of using bounds based on binomial coeﬃcients. Perhaps a reﬁnement of these arguments may lead to an
aﬃrmation of H¨ahnle’s conjecture (see [17]) asserting ∆u(n, d) ≤ d(n − 1). Given Theorem 7.4 and (3), we
conjecture the slightly weaker statement that ∆u(n, d) is bounded above by n2+ε.
Though linear programming can be solved in polynomial time using Kachiyan’s ellipsoid method (see [21])
and Karmarkar’s interior point method (see [20]), linear programming is not known to be strongly polynomial
time in the sense of [8]. Further details are found in [15], [32], and [37]. Even if the Polynomial Hirsch
Conjecture is true, the bigger question remains the existence of a pivot rule so that the simplex algorithm for
linear programming applies a polynomial number of simplex pivots. The existence of such a rule would admit
a strongly polynomial time algorithm for linear programming, answering Smale’s (see [38]) ninth problem.
