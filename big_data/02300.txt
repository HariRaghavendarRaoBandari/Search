ABSTRACT
We present analytic theory for the total column density of singly ionized carbon (C+) in the
optically thick photon dominated regions (PDRs) of far-UV irradiated (star-forming) molec-
ular clouds. We derive a simple formula for the C+ column as a function of the cloud (hy-
drogen) density, the far-UV ﬁeld intensity, and metallicity, encompassing the wide range of
galaxy conditions. We verify our analysis with detailed numerical PDR models. For optically
thick gas, most of the C+ column is mixed with hydrogen that is primarily molecular (H2),
and this “C+/H2” gas layer accounts for almost all of the ‘CO-dark’ molecular gas in PDRs.
The C+/H2 column density is limited by dust shielding and is inversely proportional to the
metallicity down to ∼0.1 solar. At lower metallicities, H2 line blocking dominates and the
C+/H2 column saturates. Applying our theory to CO surveys in low redshift spirals we esti-
mate the fraction of C+/H2 gas out of the total molecular gas to be typically ∼0.4. At redshifts
1 < z < 3 in massive disk galaxies the C+/H2 gas represents a very small fraction of the total
molecular gas (. 0.16). This small fraction at high redshifts is due to the high gas surface
densities when compared to local galaxies.

Key words: galaxies:ISM – ISM:clouds – ISM:molecules – submillimeter:ISM

1 INTRODUCTION

Gas in galaxies can be directly observed by several methods.
Most commonly and accessibly, the atomic H I gas is observed in
its 21 cm emission and molecular H2 is observed through tracer
molecules - mainly CO rotational lines. But do these tracers ac-
count for all the neutral and molecular gas? From models of the
structure of molecular clouds one should expect a region in the
cloud in which hydrogen is predominantly in H2 form but the car-
bon exists mostly as C+ and has not formed CO. Such C+/H2 gas
emits neither in 21 cm nor in CO lines.

Where will such a region exist in a cloud? In order to main-
tain the gas as molecular in H2 and CO, both must be shielded
from dissociation by UV photons at wavelengths close to their
spectral absorption lines. This shielding is achieved by a combi-
nation of dust, and H2 & CO self and mutual shielding. However,
the much more abundant H2 is more eﬃcient at shielding itself
than at shielding CO and thus, the H I→H2 transition occurs before
CO is fully shielded by dust, H2 and itself (van Dishoeck & Black
1988; Sternberg et al. 2014; Bialy & Sternberg 2016). In these re-
gions UV photons can still pass between the H2 lines and ionize
the carbon. The gas that exists deeper than the H I→H2 transition
but before CO is fully shielded is the C+/H2 gas and is sometimes
referred to as ‘dark gas’. Of course this term is a misnomer since
this gas does emit in other spectral lines, most relevant of which is
[C II] 158 µm. We will refer to this gas as C+/H2, or ‘CO-dark gas’.

A population of neutral C also exists outside of the CO dominated
region though its column is smaller than the C+ in most relevant
conditions.

Indeed, observational evidence indicate to the presence of
non-negligible amounts of C+/H2 gas in local clouds and overall in
galaxies. Reach et al. (1994) concluded from resolved H I and CO
maps of molecular clouds that the H2 must be spatial more extent
than the CO-detected regions. Grenier et al. (2005) used gamma
rays emitted by interaction of cosmic-rays with the gas to mea-
sure the total column density in the solar neighborhood and com-
pared that to the columns measured from HI and CO maps. They
inferred a signiﬁcant column of ‘CO-dark gas’ of the same order as
the molecular gas detected through CO lines. Langer et al. (2010)
found excess of C+ emissions from diﬀuse clouds and concluded
that the excess must be attributed to a molecular phase with no CO
in it. More recently, Pineda et al. (2013) and Langer et al. (2013)
used far-infrared and sub-millimeter spectroscopy from Herschel
to study the molecular content of the Milky-Way. They ﬁnd 30–
40% of the Milky-Way molecular gas is in the C+/H2 phase, and
that the fraction in individual clouds depends on the column density
of the cloud - higher in diﬀuse clouds and lower in dense clouds.

In extragalactic observations the total gas column can be in-
directly inferred from modeling the the far-infrared emission to
derive the dust content and converting the dust column into gas
column. Israel (1997) and Leroy et al. (2007) used such dust mod-
eling methods in low metallicity galaxies and conclude that large
amounts of H2 gas is not detected in CO. Leroy et al. (2011) ex-
tended the study to a range of metallicities and ﬁnd that the inferred

2

amount of the ‘CO-dark gas’ increase with decreasing metallic-
ity. Genzel et al. (2012) reached a similar conclusion based on CO
measurements and arguments of star formation eﬃciency.

Wolﬁre et al.

(2010, W10 hereafter) modeled molecular
clouds as a sphere with a r−1 density proﬁle and used a numerical
code to calculate the abundance proﬁles inside such a cloud. Us-
ing this model they studied the fraction of the ‘CO-dark gas’ as a
function of various parameters such as the radiation ﬁeld, metallic-
ity and mean surface density of the cloud. They estimate a typical
‘CO-dark gas’ fraction of ∼0.3 in giant molecular clouds, where the
strongest dependency is on the mean total optical depth (from one
side to the other) of the cloud. Their result is in a generals agree-
ment with the 3D hydro simulations of Glover et al. (2010).

The main goal of this paper is to derive a simple analytic for-
mula to the total column of the C+/H2 gas, based on ﬁrst principles,
and then test the analytic results against a numerical code. In Sec-
tion 2 we describe our simple model of a plane-parallel cloud. In
Section 3 we present our analytic formula of the C+ column and
compare it with the numerical models. In Section 4 we describe
the grid of numerical models we calculated in order to test the ef-
fects of diﬀerent parameters. In Section 5 we discuss the column
of neutral C between the C+ and CO dominated regions. In Sec-
tion 6 and 7 we discuss the expected C+/H2columns in galaxies
and the [C II] 158 µm emission from this gas. Finally, in Section 8
we discuss our results in the context of CO surveys and the total
gas content of galaxies.

2 MODELS

We consider the standard H I/H2 and C+/C/CO transitions and
chemical structures for plane-parallel PDRs, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 1. We focus on optically thick slabs illuminated on both sides
by an isotropic far-UV photodissociating and photoionizing ra-
diation. In general, the H I to H2 transition occurs at smaller
cloud depths compared to the location of the C+/C/CO transi-
tions (Tielens & Hollenbach 1985; Sternberg & Dalgarno 1995).
The cloud depth from one cloud surface to the mid-plane may
be parametrized by the total hydrogen gas column density N ≡
NHI + 2NH2, or by the associated and metallicity-dependent visual
extinction AV into the cloud. Here, NHI and NH2 are the columns of
atomic and molecular hydrogen from the surface to the given depth.
For optically thick slabs (Figure 1) the radiative transfer and chem-
ical structures on each side are equivalent to that in a semi-inﬁnite
slab illuminated from one side.

The structure consists of four zones. First is an outer “C+/H I”
layer in which the carbon is ionized and the hydrogen is atomic.
Second is the “C+/H2” layer in which the carbon is still ionized,
but the hydrogen is molecular. Third is “C/H2” in which the car-
bon is in neutral atomic form. Fourth is the “CO/H2” core in which
most of the carbon is locked in CO (and the hydrogen is H2). The
relative sizes of these zones depend in general on several parame-
ters, including the gas density, the far-UV intensity, the cosmic-ray
ionization rate, and the gas-phase oxygen and carbon abundances,
as set by the metallicity and grain depletion factors.

In § 4 we present numerical computations for the C+/C/CO
structures for a wide range of metallicities. As we will show, also
analytically in § 3, the C+/H I layer is generally small or negligible
compared to C+/H2, and the C/H2 layer is also small. Thus, the
C+/H2 column represents the “CO-dark” H2 gas that is not mixed
with CO. Our analytic formula (§ 3) for the C+ column density and

erage angle factor that appears for irradiation by isotropic ﬁelds
(Sternberg et al. 2014). The dimensionless parameter is

(2)

Here, n = n1 + 2n2 is the total (atomic plus molecular) hydrogen
gas density (cm−3), R is the dust grain H2 formation rate coeﬃcient
(cm3 s−1), D0 is the optically thin H2 dissociation rate (s−1) in a
“free-space” radiation ﬁeld, G is the average H2 self-shielding fac-
tor. The numerator can also be expressed using wFLW that is the
eﬀective photon ﬂux (cm−2 s−1) of Lyman-Werner (LW) band ra-
diation available for H2 dissociation in dusty clouds, ¯fdiss = 0.12
is the mean dissociation probability averaged over all lines, and
σg is the mean dust absorption cross-section per hydrogen nu-
cleus within the LW band. For a radiation ﬁeld normalized to
the Draine (1978) representation of the Galactic interstellar ﬁeld
D0 = 5.8 × 10−11IUV s−1 and FLW = 2.07 × 107IUV cm−2 s−1, where
IUV is the ﬁeld intensity factor. The parameter w ≤ 1 is the normal-
ized H2-dust limited LW absorption bandwidth. For solar metallic-
ity and typical dust-to-gas mass ratios, w ∼ 0.5.

If the dust-to-gas ratio is proportional to the metallicity then
the mean dust absorption cross section per H nucleon for LW-band
photons is

σg = σg,⊙Z ′ = 1.9 × 10−21φgZ ′ .

(3)

We parametrize the metallicity by Z ′, where Z ′ = 1 corresponds
to solar photospheric abundances of the heavy elements. For solar
metallicity σg = σg,⊙. In Eq. 3, φg is a factor of order unity that
depends on the dust absorption and scattering properties. Here we
adopt φg = 0.93.

For αG > 1 (strong ﬁeld limit) absorption of LW-band photons

When αG < 1 (weak ﬁeld limit) the absorption of LW-band pho-

3 ANALYTIC FORMULA FOR C+ COLUMN DENSITY

3.1 C+ Chemistry

In PDRs, C+ is produced primarily by photoionization

C + ν → C+ + e− ,

(7)

by photons with energies between the neutral carbon ionization
threshold 11.26 eV and the Lyman limit at 13.6 eV. Remark-
ably, this energy range corresponds almost exactly to the Lyman-
Werner 11.2–13.6 eV band for H2-line dissociation. The contin-
uum carbon photoionization cross section is σC = 1.5 × 10−17 cm2
(van Dishoeck et al. 2006), and the photoionization rate in a radia-
tion ﬁeld with IUV = 1 is then Γ = FLW σC = 3 × 10−10 s−1.

There are three dominant processes for the removal of the C+.

First is neutralization via radiative recombination

C+ + e− → C + ν .

(8)

(Altun et al. 2004; Badnell 2006; Wolﬁre et al. 2008) may be ex-
pressed as

αe = 1.8 × 10−11(cid:18) T

cm3 s−1 ,

(9)

where T is the gas temperature.

Second is grain-assisted neutralization,

C+ + e : gr → C + gr

.

(10)

The rate coeﬃcient for this process depends on the grain size dis-
tribution, charge, and the gas temperature. For an MRN grain size
distribution (Mathis et al. 1977) we can use the Draine & Sutin
(1987) expression for the rate coeﬃcient per hydrogen nucleon
(their Eq. 5.15). For C+ and for a solar metallicity dust-to-gas ratio

αgr ≈ 2.9 × 10−15  amin

(11)

where amin is the minimum grain size. We adopt a standard amin =
30 Å and T = 100 K. The dust neutralization rate coeﬃcient scales
linearly with the dust-to-gas ratio, and we assume that the latter
scales linearly with the metallicity Z ′.

The third removal process is radiative association with H2,

C+ + H2 → CH+

2 + ν .

(12)

The reaction rate coeﬃcient (Gerlich 1994; Wakelam et al. 2012)
is

where φo/p = 1 for ortho-H2 and φo/p = 2.5 for para-H2. In our
analysis and numerical models (§ 4) we adopt φo/p = 1.

3.2 C+ Formation-Destruction Equation

With the above processes in mind, a formation-destruction equation
for the steady state C+/C density ratio at any cloud depth may be
written down.

For a cloud embedded in an isotropic ﬁeld with IUV = 1, the

photoionization rate at any cloud depth, from the cloud surface is

Γ(N) =

e−τ/µdµ .

Here, N ≡ NH I + 2NH2 is the hydrogen gas column from the surface

Nordon & Sternberg

to the given cloud depth. Γ is the free space ionization rate, Γ/2 is
the rate at the surface of an optically thick cloud, and µ ≡ cos θ,
where θ is the angle relative to the normal. For any ray direction
the photoionization rate is reduced by an exponential factor e−τ/µ,
where τ is the eﬀective opacity (in the normal direction). The ef-
fective opacity is due to the combination of dust absorption and
H2-line blocking of the photoionizing radiation. As we discuss fur-
ther below, CI opacity is always negligible.

The C+/C formation-destruction equation is then

(cid:16)αene + αgrZ ′n + kH2 nH2(cid:17) nC+ ≡ ReﬀnnC+ = IUVΓ(N)nC ,

where nC+ and nC are the local C+ and C densities (cm−3) respec-
tively. In Eq. 15, we have deﬁned Reﬀ as the total eﬀective C+ neu-
tralization rate coeﬃcient per hydrogen nucleus.

(15)

To a good approximation, the electron density ne ≈ nC+ in
the C+ layer. This approximation holds unless the metallicity is ex-
tremely low and/or the cosmic-ray ionization rate is very high (e.g.,
Bialy & Sternberg 2015) in which case H+ can become the domi-
nant positive charge carrier as opposed to C+. Furthermore, since
all available carbon is ionized, nC+ = AZ ′n where A is the gas phase
carbon abundance at solar metallicity. We set A = 1.32 × 10−4. We
also assume that the hydrogen is fully H2 in the C+ layer so that
nH2 = n/2. With these assumptions, the C+ neutralization rate co-
eﬃcient is

Reﬀ = αeAZ ′ + αgrZ ′ + 0.5kH2 .

(16)

In Figure 2 we plot Reﬀ, as well as its three individual components,
as a function of Z ′ and T . The radiative association rate coeﬃcient
kH2 does not depend on the metallicity and although for Z ′ = 1
it is small compared to the recombination processes, it does be-
come important when the metallicity is low (Z . 0.1). Thus, at
high metallicities, Reﬀ ∝ Z ′, and at suﬃciently low metallicities
Reﬀ becomes weakly dependent on Z ′. For amin = 30 Å, dust neu-
tralization is comparable to radiative recombination. For a much
smaller amin = 3 Å (Draine & Sutin 1987; Lepp et al. 1988) dust
neutralization can dominate at all temperatures and metallicities.

3.3 Pure Dust Attenuation

We start with the simple high-Z ′ limit (Z ′ & 0.1) for which the
carbon-ionizing photons are absorbed by dust, with negligible H2
line-blocking. We will assume that in the volume where C is pho-
toionized all the carbon is in either C or C+ form, with negligible
CO.

For any metallicity the dust optical depth is

τ ≡ σgN = σg,⊙Z ′N = (cid:18) σg,⊙

A (cid:19) (NC + NC+) ,

(17)

where we have assumed that the carbon abundance AZ ′ and the dust
absorption cross section σg,⊙Z ′ are both linear in Z ′. NC+ and NC are
the C+ and C columns from the edge of the cloud to a given depth.
The density ratio nC+ /nC ≡ dNC+ /dNC, so the formation destruc-
tion equation (Eq. 15) may be written as the diﬀerential equation

(§ 2.1). It is the ratio of the free space carbon photoionization rate

Thus, for most conditions of interest Y >> 1, the carbon is fully
ionized at the cloud surfaces, and shielding is required to allow the
transition from C+ to C.

(21)

To enable this separation we have approximated µ by a constant
average hµi on the left hand side. On the right hand side we keep
µ as a variable in the angular integration. This approximation is
similar to that used in Sternberg et al. (2014) to develop Eq. (1) for
the H I column. When comparing to numerical calculations (§ 4),
we ﬁnd that setting hµi ≈ 1 provides a good ﬁt to the results of the
numerical radiative transfer computations.

Equation (21) is a functional relationship, NC+(NC), between
the C+ column and the C column. Because the C+ column is set by

processes involving just C and C+, without reference to CO (the
transition to C occurs before the transition to CO), we may develop

The mean hµi that appears in this expression may now be dropped
since our numerical results show that setting hµi ≈ 1 provides the
best ﬁt. One may expect hµi ≈ 1, since the C+ layer extends to a few
optical depths, and photons traveling at even moderate angles from
the normal direction are already absorbed at much lower depths.

(24)

Importantly, the characteristic column A/σg,⊙ = 7.5 × 1016 cm−2 is
a constant independent of Z ′. For carbon and dust abundances both
scaling with the metallicity, the C+ layer extends to a greater linear
depth as Z ′ is reduced, but the greater extent is compensated by the
reduced carbon abundance, giving rise to the characteristic column.

Here, φH2 . 1 is a gas “compression factor” that allows for the
possibility that the H2 component mixed with C+ is denser than
any multiphase H I in an outer atomic layer. In Figure 3 we plot
YCNM as a function of Z ′ ranging from 10−2 to 3, for T = 50, 100,
and 200 K. For this range of metallicities and temperatures YCNM
varies from 7 × 102 to 5 × 104. For T=100 K, and Z ′ = 1, YCNM =
2.4 × 103, and then as given by Eq. 24 Ntot
C+ = 4.8 × 1017 cm−2.
Because YCNM >> 1, the C+ column varies only logarithmically
and is insensitive to the value of Y as set by IUV/n or Z ′.

“C+/(H I + H2)” column is equal to 1/σg multiplied by a logarith-
mic factor. However, because Y >> αG, and unless αG is unusu-
ally large, the H I column (as given by Eq. 1) is only a small frac-
tion of the C+/(H I + H2) column. For example, for Z ′ = 1 and
for αG = αGCNM = 2.5 and Y = YCNM = 2.4 × 103, we get
NHI = 2.6 × 1020 cm−2, but Ntot
(HI+H2),C+ = 3.6 × 1021 cm−2. In gen-
eral, the H I column is less than 10% of the H2 hydrogen column
mixed with the C+, for αG . 4.5. Thus, for IUV/n . 0.1 cm3
the hydrogen column associated with the C+ may be assumed to be
fully molecular. This C+/H2 hydrogen column density is then given
by

Neglecting the weak dependence on metallicity of the logarithmic
factor, the C+/H2 column scales inversely with Z ′.

The total LW-band optical depth associated with C+ layer is:
τLW = NC+ /H2 ·(σg,⊙Z ′). Therefore, as with Ntot
C+ above, τLW is almost
invariant. Assuming the CNM relation, the eﬀective optical depth
of the C+ layer is nearly constant at τLW ≈ 6.5, or equivalent visual
extinction of AV ≈ 2.

3.4 Inclusion of H2-Line Blocking

In addition to dust, H2 also absorbs carbon ionizing photons in
discrete LW-band transitions. The narrow Doppler cores of the H2
lines become optically thick at low H2 columns, but radiation be-
tween the lines remains available to photoionize the carbon. At suf-
ﬁciently large H2 columns the damping wings of the absorption
lines overlap and shield the carbon. This eﬀect becomes especially
important at low-Z ′, where the C+/H2 hydrogen column (as given
by Eq. (27)) becomes large.

As we discuss in Appendix A, the (complicated) attenuation
of the carbon-ionizing radiation due to H2 line-blocking may be ap-
proximated as an exponential attenuation. Along rays in the normal
direction the speciﬁc intensity then decreases as,

IUV = IUV(0)e−τduste−τH2 ,

where as before τdust ≡ σgN = σg(NHI + 2NH2), and

τH2 ≡ 2σH2 NH2 .

(28)

(29)

Here, σH2 is an eﬀective cross-section that we evaluate by ﬁtting
to the results of numerical computations for the depth dependent
radiation ﬁeld (see Appendix A). To eliminate factors of two in our
expressions below, we deﬁne σH2 as the eﬀective H2 line-blocking
opacity per hydrogen nucleon, by analogy to σg which is the dust
opacity per hydrogen nucleon. We ﬁnd that for Z ′ & 10−2 and for
log(IUV/n) > −4, setting

σH2 = 7.5 × 10−23

cm−2

(30)

provides a good representation for the H2 line blocking opacity.
Importantly, σH2 is independent of Z ′ and line-blocking becomes
increasingly important compared to the dust opacity as the metal-
licity becomes small.

4 C+/C/CO TRANSITIONS FOR VARYING

METALLICITY

4.1 Numerical Models

In order to be able to test the analytic calculation we use a numeri-
cal chemistry and radiation transfer code. The Meudon PDR code1
(Le Petit et al. 2006) uses full line-resolved radiative transfer and a
large chemical reactions library to solve for the steady state abun-
dance structures of the cloud. One of the key features of the code is
that it allows to choose an isotropic radiation ﬁeld as the illuminat-
ing source.

A grid of models is created in which we vary the radiation
ﬁeld (1 ≤ IUV ≤ 103), density (102 ≤ n ≤ 104 cm−3) and metallic-
ity (0.01 ≤ Z ′ ≤ 3.0). Inside this parameter space we also calcu-
late several series of models that adopt the CNM relation between
IUV, n and Z ′. The gas-to-dust ratio and NH/E(B-V) ratio (‘gratio’
and ‘cdunit’ parameters in the PDR code) are linearly coupled to
the metallicity. Cosmic radiation is initially turned oﬀ. The latter
has little eﬀect on the C+ → C0 transition at the shell, but has
a more signiﬁcant eﬀects on the C→CO transition and processes
inside the CO core. We also run the same models with cosmic
rays turned on at a few times galactic level (H2 ionization rate
of 10−16 s−1) to verify that the eﬀect on Ntot
C+ is not very signiﬁ-
cant. Each model is set up as a constant temperature (100 K), con-
stant density, semi-inﬁnite slab and integrated till a depth at which
AV =12 and C+/C/CO abundances are no longer a function of depth.
Such a depth is well into the CO core and into regions where in
real clouds the temperature signiﬁcantly decrease and the density
increase. However, we are interested only in the results until the
transition to CO (AV ≈2–3, at the edge of the temperature(density)
drop(rise), and therefore the uniform temperature and density as-
sumptions are acceptable.

The abundance structures as calculated by the PDR code for
several models assuming CNM conditions are plotted in Figure 4.

1 http://pdr.obspm.fr/PDRcode.html

In the numerical models described in Section 4, as well as in our
analytic calculation of Ntot
C+ we have ignored the eﬀects of cosmic
rays (CR). In CR we include energetic particle and hard ionizing
photons (X-rays) together, since both penetrate deep into the cloud
and have a similar eﬀect on the chemistry. Cosmic rays are very im-
portant in molecular clouds since they penetrate deep into the core
of the clouds and create ionization in regions completely shielded
from UV. However, in the outer regions, where the LW band is not
completely blocked, UV photons tend to dominate the ionization.
Hence, with respect to the transition from C+ to C, we do not expect
CR processes to be very signiﬁcant, but deeper into the cloud and
in particular the transition from C to CO can be sensitive to CR.

We have recalculated the numerical models described in Sec-
tion 4 with the addition of CR, setting the H2 ionization rate to
ζ = 10−16 s−1. This ionization rate is slightly higher than the local
rate in milky way. Because CR have a low cross section for inter-
action, their intensity tends to represent the mean galactic activity.
UV on the other hand does not propagate far in the galactic disk
and UV intensity tends to represent local activity of star formation.
Young stars are typically found in the immediate vicinity of molec-
ular clouds and thus the UV to CR intensity ratio on the edges of
molecular clouds tends to be above the galactic mean. In the follow-
ing discussion we will focus on the results for the models assuming
IUV = 10, i.e. UV/CR intensities ratios are nearly 10 times higher
than the local Milky-Way values. The conclusions however are not
very sensitive to the exact values.

In the right column of Figure 4 we plot the abundance struc-
ture for the same conditions as in the left and middle columns of
the ﬁgure, except that CR are turned on. When comparing to the
middle column, it is easy to see that the depth at which C+ is no
longer the dominant form of carbon hardly changes when CR are
turned on. This is more quantitatively illustrated in Figure 5 where
we plot the cumulative NC+ column as a function of AV with and
without CR. The depth of the C+/H2 layer is quite insensitive to the
presence of CR.

With CR on, the abundance structures from the C+/C transition
and deeper into the cloud become sensitive to the metallicity. Going
deeper into the C and CO dominated regions, the C+ abundance
drops more moderately with depth when CR are on. At the lowest
metallicities, a non-zero abundance of C+ is prevalent even in the
core of the cloud, and is maintained by CR-induced processes. The
most signiﬁcant eﬀects are the shift of the transition from C to CO
into higher depths than in the no-CR case, and the ﬁnal balance
between C and CO at the core. Thus, at low Z ′ a broader region of
neutral C exists before the CO core. When the metallicity is low
enough (Z ′ < 0.1), neutral C may remain the dominant form of
carbon even at depths where there are no UV photons.

Only after all the UV is completely extinguished, including at
lower energies than the LW-band that can still dissociate molecules
such as OH (important channel in producing CO), does the rate of

CO production increase and the CO abundance increase with it till
its ﬁnal CO-core value. One must keep in mind that in reality the
temperatures and densities in the CO core may change signiﬁcantly
relative to the C+/H2 envelope. Our numerical model assumes uni-
form temperature and density, and thus the abundance results for

the inner CO-core may not be perfectly accurate, though the funda-
mental eﬀects are preserved.

Since in this paper our interest is the C+ dominated region out-
side the CO-core, we will ignore CR. While some abundance of C+
can be maintained by CR-induced processes deep inside the cloud,
the expected contribution to the [C II] 158 µm emission line (which

perature at the core is indeed lower than in the C+/H2 region, this
will make the [C II] 158 µm emission from the core lower yet.

4.3 Comparison to Analytic Formulae

In Figure 6 we compare the total C+/H2 gas column NC+ /H2 pre-
dicted by Eq. 33 with the column as calculated by the PDR code
for our models grid described in § 4. The numerically calcu-
lated columns include the HI column, which is a mean 6% of the
C+/(H I + H2) gas column, and it exceeds 12% in only one model.
Generally, when restricting to 0.01 < z < 3 and −4 < log(IUV/n) <
−0.5 cm3 the accuracy is within ±0.2 dex, and for models assuming
the CNM relation it is within ±0.1 dex. A turnover for the models
with Z ′ < 0.1 is clearly visible in the bottom panel and caused by
the change from dust shielding to H2 shielding of C. For Z ′ ∼ 0.01
H2 shielding completely dominates and Eq. 32 becomes very sen-
sitive to the ﬁxed σH2 that we selected.

In Figure 7 top panel we plot Ntot

C+ versus IUV/n. The solid
curves are calculated with Eq. 32 and data points are the results of
the PDR code. Note the limited range of Ntot
C+ columns that spans
barely one order of magnitude, while the input values IUV/n span
three orders of magnitude and Z ′ spans over two orders of magni-
tude. When comparing the shape of the analytic curves with the nu-
merical calculations of the PDR code we ﬁnd that the match is good
for solar metallicity but gets less accurate as metallicity decrease.
This behavior is also reﬂected in the overall sloped trend seen in
Figure 6 bottom panel. This inaccuracy was introduced by the ap-
proximation of H2 shielding as a constant σH2. In Appendix A we
present a more accurate treatment of a variable σH2 that is a func-
tion of the column. With a σH2(N), the accuracy improves and all

However, we feel that an accuracy better than 0.2 dex is often not
required, since it may exceeds the accuracy of other modeling as-
sumptions, or observational measurement errors.

5 NEUTRAL C

In the analytic model we have neglected the UV absorption by
neutral C, which requires a justiﬁcation. The cross-section for C
photo-ionization is σC = 1.5 × 10−17 cm2. This means that gas
columns of N & 1/(σCAξ) are required for neutral C to shield
itself, where ξ is the mean carbon fraction of C0 in the C+ re-
gion. ξ can be estimated from Eq. 15 for the case τ << 1. We get
ξ ≈ 6 × 10−5(n/IUV), meaning that the gas column required for neu-
tral C self-shielding is N ≈ 8 × 1024(IUV/n) cm−2. For the practical
cases of IUV/n > 10−4 cm3 (and in particular IUV/n ≈ 5 × 10−2 cm3
for CNM) this column is larger than the column for dust shielding
1/σg,⊙ = 6 × 1020 cm−2.

The same conclusion regarding the insigniﬁcance of neutral C
self-shielding can be reached by looking at the cumulative columns

calculated by the PDR code and plotted in Figure 5. We can see
that at the depth at which C+ is no longer the dominant carbon form
(indicated by vertical lines) and Ntot
C+ is almost reached, the neutral
C columns of NC0(AV) < 1 × 1017 cm−2 are insuﬃcient to provide
eﬀective shielding.

In Figure 4 we see that some of the C0 column is mixed with
the C+ gas outside the CO region and is part of the ‘CO-dark gas’.
Unlike C+ ↔ C0 processes, C0 ↔ CO processes are more com-
plicated and a full analytic calculation is outside the scope of this
paper. However, we will argue that in nearly all relevant conditions
the C+ column is larger than the C0 column by factors of a few and
we can neglect the contribution of C0 to the CO-dark gas column.
In Figure 8 we plot the total NC0 column calculated by the
PDR code in the models grid as a function of the metallicity. We
include the neutral C column only until the depth at which nC0 =
nCO. The Ntot
C+ column is also plotted for comparison. At log(Z ′) ≥
−1 the scatter between the models is small and it seems that Z ′ is
the only important parameter, nearly independent of IUV and n. At
all metallicities up to solar, the C+ column is larger than the C0
column that is outside the CO region by factors of a few. However,

the latter increase almost linearly with Z ′, until at Z ′ = 3 it is about
equal to the C+ column. We ﬁnd that NC0(Z ′) for log(Z ′) ≥ −1 can
be approximated by the power-law

log(cid:18) NC0

cm−2(cid:19)nC>nCO

= 0.88 log(Z ′) + 17.0 ,

(35)

that is plotted in Figure 8 as a solid black line.

At log(Z ′) < −1 the scatter between various IUV and n starts
to be more signiﬁcant, yet in all cases NC0 << Ntot
C+. Looking at
the abundance proﬁles in Figure 4 (for the case of ζ = 0) we can
see that a signiﬁcant neutral C column does exist at Z ′ < 0.1, but
the vast majority of it is mixed with the CO instead of being mixed
with C+ (low metallicity), or forming a neutral C dominated region
(super-solar metallicity).

The existence of a signiﬁcant neutral C column inside the CO
region is due to dust shielding becoming less eﬀective than H2
shielding. H2 shields the LW-band that photo-ionize C, and also
dissociates CO through lines. Remarkably, all such CO lines are
within the LW-band (van Dishoeck & Black 1988). However, OH
which is important for forming CO through C + OH → CO + H,
can be dissociated by photons of much lower energy than the LW-
band and is not fully shielded by H2. Thus, the formation of CO
through reaction with OH is slowed down and even a low ﬂux of
LW-band photons is still suﬃcient to maintain a signiﬁcant C0 pop-
ulation by dissociating CO. The LW band ﬂux at those depths is
insuﬃcient to maintain a C+ population, thus the C+ column ends,
and we get a region of C0 mixed with CO. This eﬀect can be seen
in the middle column of Figure 4 - At high metallicities C+ abun-
dance, as well as the C0 abundance drop at AV ≈ 2. In contrast,
at the low metallicities (bottom panels) C+ abundance drops at a
lower AV due to the contribution of H2 shielding. However, the C
at low metallicities stays high till AV ≈ 2 and only at higher depths,
with suﬃcient dust shielding to UV photons that are not blocked
by H2, C is converted into CO.

From Figure 4 (left and middle columns) it is clear that when
there are no cosmic-rays and metallicities are very low, most of the
neutral C column is mixed with CO in the CO dominated region.
The abundance of neutral C in the CO region beyond the PDR is
sensitive to the cosmic rays ﬂux, as can be seen in the right column
of Figure 4, and discussed in § 4.2. The column of neutral C inside
the CO region is not strictly ‘CO-dark gas’. Except in the case of
super-solar metallicities, where the neutral C column is both signiﬁ-
cant and mostly outside the CO dominated region, we can generally
neglect the contribution of neutral C to the CO-dark gas column.

6 THE C+/H2 GAS

NC+/H2 as a function of IUV/n is plotted in Figure 7 for various
metallicities. Note that the curves are quite ﬂat, especially around
log(IUV/n) ≈ −1.5 (n in cm−3) values typical to CNM conditions,
meaning that even large deviations in the IUV/n ratio relative to
the CNM ratio have only a small eﬀect on the resulting columns.
Therefore we can assume the relation (Eq.5) and then NC+ /H2(Z ′) is
a function of metallicity only. This result of NC+/H2(Z ′) is visualized
in Figure 9, where we plot the ‘CO-dark’ gas column on one side
of the CO core as a function of Z ′. We plot both the analytic pre-
dictions derived from Eq. 33 and the numerical results of the PDR
code. NC+/H2 is nearly linear with Z ′−1 down to Z ′ ∼ 0.1 and very
weakly dependent on the temperature, even if we vary it by factors
of 5. At 100 K and log(Z ′) > −1 the relation from our analytic

formula (Eq. 34) is approximated by

log(NC+ /H2)Z′>0.1 ≈ −1.0 log(Z ′) + 21.52 ,

(36)

which is fully consistent with the results of the PDR code.

The total amount of CO-dark molecular gas is therefore a
function of the metallicity and the total surface area of the cloud, al-
most regardless of the variations in the radiation ﬁelds due to the lo-
cation in the galaxy or nearby UV sources. Let us deﬁne the C+/H2
molecular gas fraction (approximately the CO-dark fraction) as:

fC+ /H2 ≡

2NC+ /H2
Ncloud

(37)

where Ncloud is the total column of hydrogen in the cloud from one
side to the other. The factor of two account for both sides of the slab
as sketched in Figure 1. The numerator, as we demonstrated above
depends mostly on the metallicity and very weakly on the details
of the UV radiation ﬁelds and density. The implication is that the
C+/H2 gas fraction in a galaxy is a function of the metallicity and
the typical size of the clouds in the galaxy.

In Figure 10 we plot fC+ /H2 as a function of ¯AV the mean total
AV from one side of the cloud to the other, using Eq. 34 for NC+ /H2.
fC+ /H2 reaches 1 at ¯AV ≈ 4, below which the cloud is not thick
enough to support a CO core in our model. Also plotted in Fig-
ure 10 are the results of the numerical model of W10. Their model
assumes a cloud of spherical geometry with a n ∝ r−1 density pro-
ﬁle and a mean projected ¯AV value (i.e., averaged over the sphere).
They normalize the density proﬁle so there is always a CO core
with a mass of 106 M⊙. Due to the way their model is constructed,
fC+ /H2 can never reach a value of 1 in W10, as opposed to our plane
parallel model that requires a minimum column (or Atot
V ) to produce
CO. For this reason the two models diverge at low AV. The models
converge when ¯AV is high.

From the plot one may get the impression that fC+ /H2 does not
depend on Z ′ directly and it is only the total AV of the cloud that sets
fC+ /H2. This is true only for Z ′ & 0.1 where H2 shielding is unim-
portant and the C+/H2 column scales linearly with Z ′. However, at

a lower metallicity H2 shielding moves the C+ →C transition to a
lower AV and thus lowers fC+ /H2 for a given ¯AV. This eﬀect can be
seen in the Z ′ = 0.01 curve that we plot in Figure 10.

One must keep in mind that in case the total gas column in the
cloud is insuﬃcient to support twice the column given by Eq. 33,
then this equation can only provide an upper limit to the C+ column.
In such cases the cloud will not have a CO core at all, and Ntot
C+ will
be limited by the total gas column of the cloud. At solar metallicity
this implies clouds of Ncloud & 6 × 1021 cm−2 are required in order
to support a CO core, and total columns in the range of 1023 cm−2
are required in case of metallicities Z ′ . 0.1. However, at such low
metallicities CO in the core can be easily destroyed in the presence
of CR and result in very large clouds that are non the less almost
completely CO-dark. CO destruction by CR-induced processes is
completely diﬀerent physics/chemistry from the destruction by UV
in the PDR region, and each dominates in diﬀerent locations in the
cloud. When attempting to convert CO line ﬂux measurements to
total molecular gas mass the two processes need to be taken into
account separately.

7 THE [C II] 158 µm EMISSION

The [C II] 158 µm line is one of the brightest emission lines ob-
served in star forming galaxies and contributes a signiﬁcant frac-
tion of the cooling in PDR regions. In the previous sections we
have derived an analytic expression for the column of C+ gas in
a molecular cloud. It is now interesting to investigate the relation
between the C+ column and the emerging [C II] 158 µm intensity
(which we will refer to as simply [C II] for brevity).

The Meudon PDR code calculates the full radiation transfer of
the emitted [C II] photons and returns the observed intensity. Since
we run the code as a semi-inﬁnite slab, the resulting intensity ac-
counts only for photons originating from the side of the slab facing
the observer. [C II] photons from the opposite side are likely to pass
through the cloud with little attenuation unless the total C+ column
is very large. In ﬁgure 11 we plot the [C II] intensity as a function of
the total hydrogen density for various radiation ﬁelds and metallici-

ties, at 100 K temperature. In this plot we assume the CNM relation
between IUV and n, therefore at a given metallicity IUV and n are
correlated. As we can see from the ﬁgure, the emerging [C II] inten-
sity follows nearly the same relation for metallicities of Z ′ & 0.1,
but at lower metallicities the intensity drops signiﬁcantly. This is
due to H2 shielding of neutral C that lowers the resulting C+ col-
umn, while at higher metallicities neutral C is shielded mostly by
the dust and the resulting Ntot
C+ is almost independent of metallicity
(Eq. 32).

In Figure 12 we plot the [C II] intensity to Ntot

C+ ratio versus
n as calculated by the PDR code, assuming CNM conditions. In
this plot the meaning of the y-axis is the emitted power per C+ ion.
When plotted in this way, the dependency on metallicity is nearly
canceled. There is a small increase in the [C II] emission per ion
over the general trend when Z ′ > 1 due to excitations by free-
electrons. The [C II] excitation rate by free electrons (Osterbrock
1989) depends linearly on the metallicity, while the excitation rate
by H2 collisions (Flower & Launay 1977) is independent. At Z ′ = 1
electron collisions are moderately signiﬁcant, but their contribution
drop with decreasing Z ′. At super-solar metallicities electron col-
lisions may become as signiﬁcant as H2, which explains the small
excess in [C II]/Ntot

C+ at Z ′ = 3.0.

As we can see in the ﬁgure, when the radiation ﬁelds in-
crease as does the density due to the CNM relation, the emis-
sion per ion increase less and less till it tends to a saturation at
∼ 10−21 erg s−1 str−1. This is due to a critical density of H2 beyond
which collisional de-excitation dominates over radiative decay. Fol-
lowing Tielens & Hollenbach (1985), the critical density is deﬁned
as ncrit ≡ A21/γH2, where A21 is the Einstein coeﬃcient and γH2
is the collisional de-excitation rate coeﬃcient. Since most of the
[C II] is emitted from the C+/H2 region, the carbon is de-excited
by H2 collisions and ncrit ≈ 104 cm−3 (in total hydrogen nucleons
density). The [C II] emission per ion saturates at lower densities
(∼ 4 × 103 cm−3) in the neutral H region, however this represents
only a small fraction of Ntot

C+ (Section 3).

8 DISCUSSION: C+/H2 GAS IN STAR FORMING

GALAXIES

Thanks to modern millimeter interferometers such as the Plateau-
de-bure and ALMA, it is now possible to measure molecular gas
masses in many galaxies at z > 1 via observations of CO rotational
lines. Star forming disk-like galaxies account for ∼90% of the total
star formation volume density (Rodighiero et al. 2011) and in such
galaxies very high molecular gas fractions (mean 0.4–0.5) are ob-
served (Daddi et al. 2010; Tacconi et al. 2010, 2013). Since these
gas mass measurements rely on CO lines it is interesting to con-
sider how much molecular gas is unaccounted for due to carbon
being in the C+ state - i.e. the fraction of the C+/H2 gas.

Our analytic model predicts the C+/H2 column on the face of

12

Nordon & Sternberg

the cloud, irrespective of the total cloud size/mass (given it is suﬃ-
ciently large) and thus, requires more information about the typical
clouds sizes if gas fractions are to be calculated. Under CNM con-
ditions which supposedly described global mean conditions in the
galaxy, we have found that the expected NC+ /H2 column is a func-
tion of the metallicity only (Eq. 34 and Figure 9). We can now do
the naive exercise of comparing the expected C+/H2 column with
the molecular gas columns measured from CO observations in sur-
veys such as the local COLDGASS (Saintonge et al. 2011), and the
1 < z < 2.5 PHIBBS (Tacconi et al. 2013). For the purpose of our
exercise we will assume that the uniform conversion factor used in
these surveys to convert from CO luminosity to molecular gas mass
accounts only for the molecular gas in the CO/H2 phase (i.e., the
CO core).

The COLDGASS sample covers the z = 0 SFR–Mstar rela-
tion for galaxies of Mstar > 1010 M⊙. It is randomly selected and
thus represent the typical distribution of galaxy parameters at those
masses. The typical molecular surface densities that they obtain
are of the order 20 M⊙ pc−2, though a wide range exists within
the sample. Assuming Z ′ = 1 in local massive spirals, we expect
NC+/H2 = 6 × 1021 cm−2 two-sided column that is equivalent to
ΣC+ /H2 = 68 M⊙ pc−2. We can deﬁne the C+/H2 molecular gas frac-
tion as:

fC+ /H2 =

ΣC+ /H2

ΣC+ /H2 + cΣCO/H2

(38)

where ΣCO/H2
is the molecular surface density as derived from
CO (galactic conversion factor) and c is a clumpiness factor. The
molecular gas is not evenly spread over the galaxy. Instead, it tends
to be concentrated in large clumps. This clumpiness factor (inverse
of the ﬁlling factor) represents the larger column densities at the lo-
cations of the clouds over the global mean. Krumholz et al. (2011)
for example argues (based on Krumholz et al. 2009) a clumpiness
factor c = 5. Leroy et al. (2013) ﬁnds a median c = 7 in a sam-
ple of local galaxies. Thus, we shall assume that the local columns
(ΣCO/H2) in the COLDGASS sample are higher by such a factor
(adopting c = 5). Another implicit assumption in Eq. 38 is that
when observing perpendicular to the galaxy disk we typically have
up to one cloud in the line of sight, as opposed to several clouds
behind each other. This is a reasonable assumption when most of
the molecular gas is in large clouds that occupy a sizable fraction
of the disk scale-height.

We should also consider clouds with insuﬃcient columns to
reach the max C+ column and form a CO core - can such clouds
hold a signiﬁcant fraction of the molecular gas in a galaxy? Let
us assume an extreme case in which all the area of the galaxy that
has no CO column in it is ﬁlled with the maximal NC+/H2 column.
In this special case we do not need to account for the clumpiness
factor since ΣC+ /H2 is now uniform across the disk and the observed
ΣCO/H2 is already averaged over the disk. Therefore, setting c = 1
in Eq. 38 gives the upper limit to fC+ /H2.

For the median CO surface densities in the local massive
galaxies of the COLDGASS sample we get fC+ /H2 ≈ 0.4 and an
upper limit (c = 1) of fC+ /H2 < 0.77 In these galaxies the C+/H2
gas can reach a signiﬁcant fraction of the total molecular gas due to
the low surface densities. The degree of clumpiness in these galax-
ies can have a major eﬀect on fC+ /H2. Also, in case of a large degree
of clumpiness the local galaxies can potentially hold a large amount
of C+/H2 gas in small clouds with no CO, between the giant molec-
ular clouds (GMCs).

Wolﬁre et al. (2010) calculated the C+/H2 fraction assuming
clouds of 106 M⊙ in mass and a spherical geometry. Their numeri-

cal model which is intended to represent the typical GMCs in local
galaxies yields a typical fC+ /H2 ≈ 0.3, close to our estimation above.
In the Milky Way, Pineda et al. (2013) and Langer et al. (2013) de-
rived a global fC+ /H2 ≈ 0.3 and fC+ /H2 ≈ 0.4 (respectively) from
[C II] mapping with Herschel. Thus, both the Wolﬁre et al. (2010)
theoretical model and Milky-Way measurements are similar to the
typical fC+ /H2 that we derive for the local massive spiral galaxies
from the COLDGASS survey.

At higher redshifts (1 < z < 2.5), the PHIBBS survey
observed typical star forming galaxies with a median mass of
6 × 1010 M⊙. The median molecular gas surface density is ΣH2 =
560 M⊙ pc−2 and the survey reaches molecular surface mass den-
sities down to ΣH2 ∼100 M⊙ pc−2. The expected metallicity for
the PHIBBS from the mass–metallicity relation (Erb et al. 2006)
is ∼ 0.7, thus NC+ /H2 increases by a factor of Z ′−1 = 1.4 over the
expected value at Z ′ = 1, reaching ΣC+ /H2 ≈ 95 M⊙ pc−2. Adopt-
ing an ad-hoc c = 5 clumpiness factor similar to the low redshift
galaxies, the CO-dark gas fractions are fC+/H2 = 0.03 for the me-
dian PHIBBS galaxy, and the upper limit (c = 1) is fC+ /H2 < 0.11.
Even for the lowest CO surface brightness galaxies in the PHIBBS
sample fC+ /H2 = 0.16 is still quite low.

The gas surface densities of the high redshift galaxies are so
high that even if the metallicity is as low as Z ′ = 0.1, fC+ /H2 will not
be very high. Going to even lower Z ′ ≈ 0.01, the C+/H2 columns
saturate at NC+/H2 = 2 × 1023 cm−2 (Figure 9), which translates to
ΣC+ /H2 = 2000 M⊙ pc−2 two-sided column. Such values are com-
parable to the local molecular surface densities measured from CO
in PHIBBS galaxies (after applying the clumpiness factor), though
the comparison is not strictly valid since the PHIBBS galaxies have
metallicities of Z ′ >> 0.01.

One must keep in mind that CO at low-Z ′ is sensitive to the
presence of CR. With the high global SFRs at redshifts z > 1 one
may expect a high ﬂux of CR that can dramatically lower the CO
abundance at the dense cores of low metallicity clouds. An exam-
ple of this can be seen in the right column of Figure 4 that assumes
quite a moderate CR ionization rate. Our setup for the numerical
calculation is not intended to simulate the CO cores, and thus tem-
peratures are likely too high while densities too low, but the general
behavior is still valid. In such extreme cases, even the core will be-
come ‘CO-dark’ and dominated by neutral C (and also some C+)
due to cosmic rays ionizing H2 and dissociating the CO via induced
processes. This eﬀect should not be confused with the processes in
the C+/H2 envelope which is devoid of CO due to dissociation by
the external UV ﬁeld.

9 CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have studied the transition of carbon from C+ to
C and CO in the photon dominated regions of molecular clouds.
We derived an analytic expression for Ntot
C+ the total column of C+,
which is a function of the metallicity, the ratio IUV/n, and a weak
implicit function of the temperature. We numerically calculated the
abundance structures using the Meudon PDR code and ﬁnd an ex-
cellent agreement with our analytic Ntot
C+.

The properties of the C+ layer in the PDRs of molecular clouds

can be summarized as follows:

(i) The transition from C+ to C or CO as the dominant form
of carbon occurs at AV = 1.5 for metallicities of Z ′ > 0.1. The
total optical depth associated with the total C+ column is AV = 2,
consistent with many previous results. However, at Z ′ < 0.1 this

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

C+/H2 Gas in Star-Forming Clouds and Galaxies

13

transition happens at lower AV due to H2 shielding that becomes
more signiﬁcant than dust shielding.

(ii) At all relevant conditions the column of C+ inside the molec-
ular H2 region is signiﬁcantly larger than the C+ column in the
atomic H I region. We can thus treat the C+ as if originating en-
tirely from the H2 region and NC+ /H2 ≈ Ntot
C+ /(AZ ′) is the column of
the ‘CO-dark’ gas.

(iii) NC+ /H2 the total molecular gas column associated with C+
is mostly a function of Z ′ and only a logarithmic function of IUV/n.
If adopting the CNM relation, IUV/n ratio itself becomes a function
of the metallicity and thus NC+/H2 depends on Z ′ alone.

(iv) NC+ /H2 is linear with Z ′−1 for Z ′ & 0.1. At solar metallicity,
the typical column of the C+/H2 ‘CO-dark’ molecular gas on the
face of the cloud is NC+ /H2 = 3 × 1021 cm−2. At Z ′ . 0.1 H2 shield-
ing limits the gas column associated with C+, that saturates when
Z ′ ≈ 0.01, at a column of NC+ /H2 = 1023 cm−2.

(v) the NC+ /H2 columns we derive are in practice upper limits
that are reached only if the total gas columns are large enough (N >
2 × NC+/H2). Smaller clouds will not develop a CO core in spite of
containing molecular gas. Total columns in excess of 2 × NC+/H2
will add directly to the CO column, thus the C+/H2 fraction out of
the molecular gas depends on the total column of the cloud and Z ′
(therefore AV of the cloud). This is in agreement with the numerical
model of Wolﬁre et al. (2010) in spite of their model assuming a
spherical geometry and a constant CO mass.

(vi) At metallicities 0.1 < Z ′ < 1, C+ changes into C and CO
without forming a signiﬁcant neutral C layer. At Z < 0.1 a signiﬁ-
cant neutral C column can exist. However, most of the neutral C is
mixed with the CO and only a small fraction is in the C+ region or
form a neutral C dominated region and contribute to the ‘CO-dark’
molecular gas.

The application of our analytic NC+ /H2(Z ′) to entire galaxies is
not straight forward. However, under the assumption that most of
the molecular gas is in clouds large enough to include a CO core
we estimate the typical C+/H2 fraction in local massive spirals to
be fC+/H2 ≈ 0.4. This result is consistent with spectroscopic mea-
surements in the Milky Way. In 1 < z < 2.5 normal star forming
galaxies the molecular gas columns observed in CO are so high that
the C+/H2 gas cannot hold a signiﬁcant fraction of the molecular
gas (typical fC+ /H2 . 0.11).

[C II] 158 µm observations are a promising tool to directly ob-
serve the C+/H2 gas. However, the conversion from [C II] 158 µm
brightness to gas mass in PDRs depends on estimations of the tem-
peratures, densities and the fraction of [C II] emitted from other
phases of the ISM. It is important to emphasize that our prediction
of NC+/H2 depends (almost) only on Z ′ and is independent of the
emitted [C II].

APPENDIX A: NC+ WITH A COLUMN-DEPENDENT σH2
We repeat the calculation of Ntot
C+ from Section 3, but in this case
σH2 is not a constant. The shielding of carbon by H2 lines is not
the same as the dust. While dust is not very sensitive to the exact
wavelength of the UV photons, H2 shielding is done through spec-
tral absorption lines. Therefore the cross-section for interaction for
the photons close in wavelength to the line centers is much higher
than for photons at wavelengths between the lines. The former are
quickly depleted, and as we go deeper into the cloud photons far-
ther away from the line centers start to get absorbed in the line
wings. Thus, the eﬀective cross-section for absorption gets lower
with increasing H2 column.

C+ . The dynamic rage of Ntot

We can now use the expression in Eq. A4 inside the right hand
side of the integral in Eq. A3. N0 is a constant representing a C+
column close to Ntot
C+ is quite limited
even for large variations in the radiation, density and metallicity
and is always of the order 1 × 1017 cm−2, therefore we will ﬁx N0
to this value. On the right hand side of Eq. A3 , we will take σH2 =
b(N0/(AZ ′))α. The reason is that this kernel is a decaying exponent
and C column rises sharply where C+ abundance drops sharply,
meaning around a C+ column of the same order as N0. The solution
is:

Ntot

C+ =

A

σg,⊙ + (α + 1)b(N0/A)αZ ′−α−1 ln (YT + 1)

AZ ′(cid:19)

T ≡  1 +
When compaing with the previous result for a constant σH2
(Eq. 32), we now have an additional term inside the log, T , that is a
function of metallicity only and the ad-hoc N0 = 1 × 1017 cm−2 pa-
rameter we set. We ﬁnd that setting α = −0.5 and log(b) = −10.73
yields a good compromise that can ﬁt the entire library of numeri-
cal models we produced within ±0.1 dex accuracy. For the range of
10−2 < Z ′ < 3, in the deﬁnition of T the expression in parenthesis
outside the exponent evaluates to be in the range of 0.85–1.0 and
hence can be omitted. If we use the explicit values for AZ ′ and σg,⊙,
the ﬁnal expression for Ntot

C+ is (equivalent to Eq. 32):

C+ as predicted by Eq. A7 with
the results of the Meudon code for our models grid. The analytic
expression is accurate within 0.1 dex with no signiﬁcant trend with
IUV/n. The improvement over Eq. 32 that assumes a constant σH2
and plotted in Figure 6 is clear.

+ 1(cid:17)

(A8)

In this paper we adopt a constant σH2 inspit its lower accuracy.
The simpler, cleaner expressions in Eq. 32 and Eq. 33 oﬀer a better
intuitive understanding of their behaviors. We feel that for the most
plausible cases (near CNM conditions) a constant σH2 is accurate
enough and even at more extreme IUV/n, the lower accuracy is still
of the same scale or better than other systematic uncertainties en-
countered in practical applications of the theory.

Figure A1. The eﬀective σH2 as a function of the H2 column for a model
with Z′ = 0.01, IUV = 10 and n = 590 cm−3. The bottom panel shows the
specie relative abundances as a function of the H2 column, using the same
x-axis scale as the top panel.

The dust competes with H2 lines in absorbing the UV photons
and absorbs photons close to line centers as well as between the
lines indiscriminately. Thus, the eﬀect of dust is to increase the
mean cross section for H2 absorption at a given depth in the cloud
by decreasing the population of photons between the H2 lines (i.e.,
increase the relative weight of the near-line photons in the eﬀective
σH2).

We can use the output of the Meudon PDR code that tracks the
photo-ionization rate of C to calculate the eﬀective cross section
for absorption by H2 as a function of the total H2 column NH2. The
eﬀective σH2 at a given H2 column in the cloud is deﬁned by the
C+ ionization rate, such that:

R(NH2) = R(0) exp(−σg,⊙Z ′N − 2σH2 NH2)

(A1)

Where R(0) is the carbon ionization rate at the face of the cloud.
The photo-ionization rate as a function of depth is one of the out-
puts of the code. Such an example is plotted in Figure A1 and we
can see that σH2 can be well described by a power-law.

σH2 = b′Nα
H2

≈ b(NC+/(AZ ′))α

(A2)

We are interested in σH2 close to the maximal depth of the C+ dom-
inated region, where the C+ abundance falls. At that depth, most of
the total hydrogen column is in H2 and almost all of the carbon
column is in C+, thus we can use NC+ /(AZ ′) instead of NH2 in the
power-law, with a minor adjustment to the coeﬃcients. The coeﬃ-
cients change only little depending on the conditions.

We now repeat the calculation from Section 3 till we get to the

integration (similar to Eq. 22) with the added σH2:

σH2 is not constant, but since the left hand side of Eq. A3 is a rising
exponent, the signiﬁcant values of σH2 are evaluated near the upper
limit of the integration, i.e., most of the integrated total comes from
integrating the kernel close to the upper limit.

Let us linearize the term σH2 NC+ near the upper limit of the
