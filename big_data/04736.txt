Understanding stellar birth requires observations of the clouds in which they form. These

clouds are dense and self-gravitating, and in all existing observations, they are molecular

with H2 the dominant species and CO the best available tracer1,2. When the abundances of

carbon and oxygen are low compared to hydrogen, and the opacity from dust is also low,

as in primeval galaxies and local dwarf irregular galaxies3, CO forms slowly and is eas-

ily destroyed, so it is difﬁcult for it to accumulate inside dense clouds4. Here we report

interferometric observations of CO clouds in the local group dwarf irregular galaxy Wolf-

1

Lundmark-Melotte (WLM)5, which has a metallicity that is 13% of the solar value6,7 and

50% lower than the previous CO detection threshold. The clouds are tiny compared to the

surrounding atomic and H2 envelopes, but they have typical densities and column densities

for CO clouds in the Milky Way. The normal CO density explains why star clusters form-

ing in dwarf irregulars have similar densities to star clusters in giant spiral galaxies. The

low cloud masses suggest that these clusters will also be low mass, unless some galaxy-scale

compression occurs, such as an impact from a cosmic cloud or other galaxy. If the massive

metal-poor globular clusters in the halo of the Milky Way formed in dwarf galaxies, as is

commonly believed, then they were probably triggered by such an impact.

WLM is an isolated dwarf galaxy at a distance of 985 ± 33 kpc5. Like other dwarfs, the

relative abundance of supernova-processed elements (“metals”) like Carbon and Oxygen is low6,

12+log(O/H) = 7.8, compared to 8.66 for the Milky Way7. Low C and O abundances, along with

the correspondingly low abundances of other processed elements and dust, make the CO molecule

rare compared to H2, and this calls into question the standard model of star formation in CO-rich

clouds1. In fact, the star formation rate8 compared to the existing stellar mass is actually high in
WLM: 0.006 M(cid:12) yr−1 of new stars for a total stellar mass9 of 1.6 × 107 M(cid:12) is 12 times higher
than in the Milky Way, where the star formation rate10 is ∼ 1.9± 0.4 M(cid:12) yr−1 and the stellar mass
is 6.4 ± 0.6 × 1010 M(cid:12)11. Thus WLM forms stars efﬁciently even with a relatively low abundance

of CO.

To understand star formation in metal-poor galaxies, which include the most numerous galax-

2

ies in the local universe, the dwarfs, plus all primeaval galaxies, we previously searched for CO(3-

2) in WLM using the APEX telescope 12, discovering it in two unresolved regions at an abundance

relative to H2 that was half that in the next-lowest metallicity galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud.

Now, with the completion of the new millimeter and sub-mm wavelength interferometer Atacama

Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), we have imaged these two regions in CO(1-0) and resolved the

actual molecular structure.

The ALMA maps with 6.2 × 4.3 pc spatial resolution (HPBW), 5 mJy sensitivity, and 0.5
km s−1 velocity resolution (FWHM) contain 10 CO clouds with an average radius of 2 parsecs
and an average virial mass of 2 × 103 M(cid:12). Figure 1 shows the CO emission with black contours

superposed on HI in green and Hα in red. The insert shows a color composite of the optical image

in green (V-band), the FUV GALEX image in blue and the HI in red. A [CII]λ158 µm image from

the Herschel Space Observatory13 is superposed on the Southeast region in blue14. The [CII] is

from a photodissociation region including ionized carbon; it is 5 times larger in size than the CO

core, indicating a gradual transition between low density atomic gas to high density molecular gas.

Figure 2 shows the contours and spectra of each cloud. The spectral signal-to-noise averages

10 when smoothed to the typical linewidth of 2 km s−1. Velocities for HI emission are indicated

by a bar below each CO spectrum. The cloud properties are summarized in Table 1. The radii R

range from 1.5 to 6 pc, obtained using the equation R = (A/π)0.5 for area A, with A determined

after deconvolution by quadratic difference with the beam area. The sum of all the line emission

measured by ALMA is within a factor of 2 of the total emission found at 18(cid:48)(cid:48) resolution by the

3

APEX telescope. The linewidths were corrected for instrumental spectral broadening.

Virial masses for the CO clouds were calculated from the relation Mvir(M(cid:12)) = 1044Rσ2 for
R in pc and Gaussian linewidths σ in km s−1. The CO luminosity in K km s−1 pc2 was calculated
from LCO = 2453SCO∆V D2 for integrated emission S in Jy km s−1, FWHM of the line ∆V in km
s−1, and distance D in Mpc. Figure 3 shows the relationships between these values including other

dwarf galaxies (all for CO(1-0)). The CO clouds in WLM satisfy the usual correlations although

they are the smallest seen for any of these galaxies. Higher resolution observations should reveal

small clouds and/or cores in other galaxies too, but the main point is that WLM has no CO clouds

as large as those seen elsewhere.

The virial mass gives some perspective on the conversion from CO luminosity to mass

derived previously12, which was αCO ∼ 124 ± 60 M(cid:12) pc−2(cid:16)

K km s−1(cid:17)−1 for the NW re-

gion. This value for α was derived from the dust-derived H2 column density. If instead we take
the virial masses and CO luminosities in Table 1, we ﬁnd that the mean ratio is αvir ∼ 28 ±

K km s−1(cid:17)−1. If the clouds are not gravitationally bound, then αvir would be smaller.

28 M(cid:12) pc−2(cid:16)

The difference between these two α values arises because most of the H2 volume has no CO emis-

sion, which apparently exists only in the densest cores of the H2 clouds. For the Milky Way, CO and

H2 have about the same extent in star-forming clouds, making αCO ∼ 4 M(cid:12) pc−2(cid:16)

K km s−1(cid:17)−1.

When CO does not ﬁll an H2 cloud, α can be small for each CO core but large for the total H2

cloud. If the purpose of α is to determine the total H2 mass in a region based on LCO, then the

large value should be used.

4

The self-gravitational boundedness of the CO clouds can be estimated from the general re-
quirement of an associated H2 density of ∼ 103 cm−3 for collisional excitation15. In fact, the virial
density of the CO clouds is comparable to this, n(H2) = 4.1 × 10−21 g cm−3 (∼ 103 cm−3), from
the ratio of the virial mass (∼ 2 × 103 M(cid:12)) to the cloud volume (4πR3/3 for R ∼ 2 pc). Thus the

clouds could be marginally bound.

Another measure of CO density is from pressure equilibrium between the CO regions and

the weight of the overlying HI and H2 layers. The H2 mass column density, ΣH2, comes from

the difference between the total gas column density derived from the dust emission and the HI
column density observed at 21 cm. For the NW region12, ΣH2 = 31± 15 M(cid:12) pc−2. Adding the HI
column density12 gives Σtotal = 58± 15 M(cid:12) pc−2. The corresponding pressure from self-gravity is
total ∼ 1.6 × 10−11 dynes. Considering the typical CO velocity dispersion for our clouds
(π/2)GΣ2
of σ ∼ 0.9 km s−1, the ratio of the core pressure to the square of the CO velocity dispersion is
the equilibrium core density, 1.9 × 10−21 g cm−3, corresponding to 500 H2 cm−3. Thus the virial
density, excitation density, and pressure equilibrium density are all about 103 cm−3.

A condition for molecules in the Milky Way is a threshold extinction of AV = 0.3 mag for
H2 and ∼ 1.5 mag for CO16. These correspond to mass column densities of 6.1 M(cid:12) pc−2 and
30.3 M(cid:12) pc−2 in the solar neighborhood. In WLM where the metallicity is 13% solar, the mass
thresholds are 47 M(cid:12) pc−2 and 230 M(cid:12) pc−2 for the same extinctions, respectively. The ﬁrst is
satisﬁed by the HI+H2 envelope of the CO cores (∼ 58 M(cid:12) pc−2) and the second is satisﬁed by the
total column density of 220 M(cid:12) pc−2 calculated from the HI and H2 envelope, plus the H2 from

5

the embedded CO core itself (as determined from the CO virial mass, 2 × 103 M(cid:12), and ALMA

measured radius, 2 pc). These results suggest that the CO clouds in WLM are normal in terms

of density, pressure, and column density, which explains why they lie on the standard correlations

in Figure 3. They also appear to be marginally self-bound by gravity, suggesting they are related

to star formation. Their properties are typical for parsec-size molecular cloud cores in the solar

neighborhood17.

Our observation explains why star clusters have about the same central densities in dwarf

irregular18 and spiral galaxies19 even though the ambient gas density in dwarfs is much less than in

spirals20. If the unifying process for star formation is the need to form CO and other asymmetric

molecules for cooling (however, see16, 21), then the similarity between the CO cores in the two

cases accounts for the uniformity of clusters. The small mass of the CO cores in WLM also

explains why most dwarf galaxies do not form high mass clusters18. The CO parts of interstellar

clouds are smaller at lower metallicities, so the clusters that result are smaller too. For example,

there are no massive young clusters in these regions of WLM18. This lack of massive clusters is

usually attributed to sparse sampling of the cluster mass distribution function at low star formation

rates18, but the present observations suggest it could result from some physical reason too, like the

lack of massive CO clouds at low metallicity.

When the local dwarf galaxies NGC 1569 and NGC 5253 formed massive clusters, there was

a major impact event to increase the pressure and mass at high density22, 23. Such an impact would

also seem to be needed for the formation of old halo globular clusters, which are massive and low

6

metallicity like their former dwarf galaxy hosts24, 25.

ALMA Observations We observed the 12CO(J = 1− 0) transition in two regions in WLM using

the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) located on the Chajnantor Plateau in

northern Chile during Cycle 1. Observations were carried out on 2013 July 8 and 2014 April 3.

The ALMA receivers were tuned to the ground rotational transition of Carbon Monoxide, CO(1-

0). The interferometer conﬁguration C32-2/C32-3 provides a maximum baseline of 0.442 km. The

observations were done with a spectral resolution of 122 kHz per channel (0.32 km s−1) and total

bandwidth of 468.750 MHz per baseband. The source J2258–2758 was used as a bandpass cali-

brator and J2357–1125 was used to calibrate amplitude and phases with time. To set the absolute

ﬂux scale, Uranus was observed. We estimated an uncertainty in absolute calibration of 10%.

The data were calibrated, mapped, and cleaned using the ALMA reduction software CASA

(version 4.2.1). Rather than use the pipeline-delivered science data cubes, we redid the cleaning

(i.e., Fourier transform and beam deconvolution) using a better deﬁnition for masking of regions

containing emission, and natural weighting to optimize sensitivity. The maximum angular scale

for recovered emission was estimated to be 15”.

Identifying sources To make a ﬁrst cut at identifying sources, we convolved the image cube to
a 1.25” ×1.25” beam and examined a wide velocity range around the velocity expected from
the APEX detection. For the SE region we expected signal around VLSR = −120.5 km s−1 and
examined −130.5 to −110.5 km s−1. We detected candidate sources at −123 to −115.5 km s−1.
For the NW region we expected signal around −130.5 km s−1 and examined −140.5 to −120.5
km s−1, detecting potential sources at −139 to −121.5 km s−1. In each velocity channel we looked

15

for knots that had more counts than the majority of knots that were noise. Then we looked for

signal in nearly the same location in successive channels, expecting coherence over at least three

channels due to the Hanning-smoothing that had been applied. We also generally expected the

signal to build up and fade away as the channels sampled the source spectrum. With these criteria,

we rated the conﬁdence level of each candidate source as “conﬁdent”, “certain”, “not so certain”,

or “uncertain”. For the SE region, we identiﬁed 9 candidate sources, 6 ranked as “conﬁdent” or

“certain”. In the NW region, we identiﬁed 20 potential sources, 4 ranked as “certain” and the rest

as less certain.

Based on this identiﬁcation, we integrated the emission in the velocity range where CO was

seen, and produced the two velocity integrated maps shown in Figure 2 using our reduced new

higher sensitivity and velocity resolution cubes. The velocity resolution of these cubes is 0.5 km

s−1 per channel. All velocities are in the Local Standard of Rest (LSR) system. For WLM-SE,
5 integrated maps were made covering a total LSR velocity range VLSR = −121 to −115.5 km
s−1; the maps spanned velocities of −121.0 to −115.5, −121.5 to −119.0, −119.0 to −117.5,
−118.5 to −117.0, and −124.0 to −120.5 km s−1. For WLM-NW, 4 integrated maps were made
covering VLSR = −136.5 to −124 km s−1; the individual ranges were −137.0 to −135.5, −133.5
to −130.0, −127.5 to −125.5, and −127.0 to −125.5 km s−1. For those sources which showed

emission at a 3σ level or above, a spectrum was obtained integrating over an area delineated by a

contour drawn at 2σ (see Figure 2) in order not to miss any genuine emission. We also produced

velocity–RA and velocity–Dec maps. Inspecting the CO spectra and the velocity–position maps,

we conﬁrmed 10 CO clouds of the original 20 candidates. The remaining 10 were deemed of too

low signal-to-noise to be included in this study. On each CO spectrum plot we included the HI

emission FWHM velocity width and converted the HI Heliocentric to LSR velocity using VLSR
(i.e. VLSR = VHelio − 2.5 km s−1).

The total ﬂux of the 10 clouds resolved with ALMA was compared to the CO(3-2) ﬂux in

our previous APEX observations. We converted the CO(3-2) APEX ﬂuxes from K km s−1 to Jy

and assumed a thermal CO(1-0)/ CO(3-2) line ratio of 1. For WLM-SE we recovered a similar

ﬂux of 0.42 Jy in both cases. For WLM-NW we measured an ALMA ﬂux of 0.14 Jy while the

APEX ﬂux converted to CO(1-0) is 0.66 Jy. The difference in the NW can be due to a different

line ratio and thus different physical conditions, or it could be from weaker emission not included

in our criteria for deﬁning CO clouds, or it could be from emission that is larger in angular extent

than the largest structures measured by the interferometer and therefore absent from our maps. If

we take both regions, then the measured ﬂux with ALMA is a factor of 2 within the measured ﬂux

with APEX.

Figure 1 Tiny CO clouds in WLM. A color composite of the various gas phases in WLM:

green is the HI 26, red is Hα27, and blue is [CII]λ158 µm14. The CO emission is shown

as black single contours inside the 1 arcmin x 1 arcmin white squares that outline the

area mapped in 12CO (1-0) by ALMA. The synthesized ALMA beam (0.9”x1.3”) is shown

in the lower left corner of each square. The inset in the upper left is the full view of WLM

obtained by combining HI and optical data: red is HI, green is V -band, and blue is GALEX

Figure 2 CO clouds and spectra. CO contour maps of the integrated emission starting
at the 2−σ level (RA and DEC in J2000.0 coordinates) . Different CO clouds are identiﬁed

by color. The ALMA beam is the black ellipse in the lower left corner. The CO spectrum

corresponding to each detection is plotted. The velocity for HI emission (FWHM) is shown

as a rectangular box on the abscissa (Local Standard of Rest); the CO velocities agree

with the HI.

galaxies (SMC, Dwarfs, M31, and M3328; LMC29).
(a) CO line width σ versus radius
R; the solid line is a ﬁt to WLM, the SMC and dwarf galaxies: σ(km s−1) = (0.48 ±
0.08)R(pc)0.53±0.05 and the dashed line includes also the LMC: σ(km s−1) = (0.40 ±
0.03)R(pc)0.52±0.03. The black short-dashed line and the gray area indicate the standard
relation for the Milky Way30: σ = (0.72 ± 0.07)R0.50±0.05. R for WLM is measured in the

same way as for the Milky Way and other galaxies. (b) virial mass versus CO luminosity.
