We introduce a generalised relaxation-time-approximation form of the collision term in the Boltz-
mann kinetic equation that allows for using diﬀerent relaxation times for elastic and inelastic colli-
sions. The eﬃcacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated with the numerical calculations that
describe systems with diﬀerent relations between the two relaxation times and the evolution time
of the system.

INTRODUCTION

with the system’s energy momentum tensor T µν, namely

The successful use of perfect and viscous hydrodynam-
ics to explain behaviour of matter produced in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC [1–3] has ini-
tiated a broad interest in the formulations of relativistic
hydrodynamics and relativistic kinetic theory.
In fact,
the latter is very often used as an underlying theory for
the former [4–13].

Derivation of the equations of relativistic hydrodynam-
ics from the kinetic theory is quite complicated, mainly,
because of the complex structure of the collision term
which appears in the kinetic theory. Therefore, one of-
ten uses a simplifying assumption about the collision
term and treats it in the relaxation time approximation
(RTA) [14–24]. Within this approximation, the collision
term has the structure [15]
C = p · u

(1)

feq − f
τrel

,

where f = f (x, p) is the parton phase-space distribution
function depending on the parton space-time coordinates
x and momentum p, u = u(x) is the four-vector describ-
ing hydrodynamic ﬂow at the space-time point x, feq is
the reference equilibrium distribution function, and τrel
is the relaxation time.

The reference equilibrium distribution function feq has
the standard form (Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac or Boltz-
mann) which depends on the temperature T and chemical
potential µ. These two parameters should be treated as
eﬀective ones, i.e., they are usually ﬁxed by the two con-
ditions specifying that feq and f give locally the same en-
ergy density and particle number density (Landau match-
ing conditions). Only, if the system is close to the gen-
uine local equilibrium, T and µ can be interpreted as real
temperature and chemical potential.

In this work we use the Landau deﬁnition of the hydro-
dynamic ﬂow (Landau energy frame). The four-vector u
is deﬁned as the direction of the energy ﬂux obtained

νuν = εuµ.

Here ε is the local energy density. The local rest frame
(LRF) at the space-time point x is deﬁned by the condi-
tion uµ(x) = (1, 0, 0, 0), The equilibrium distribution feq
depends on the particle energy measured in the local rest
frame, i.e., on p · u.

The relaxation time appearing in (1) sets the overall
timescale for the approach of the system towards (local)
equilibrium. In many applications it is treated as a con-
stant.
In more realistic approaches one should include
the dependence of τrel on the local properties of matter
(typically characterised by T and µ) or on the momentum
of interacting particles [25, 26]. As the use of the medium
dependent relaxation time is rather straightforward, the
inclusion of the momentum dependence is much more
complicated. Another aspect of using RTA is that the
relaxation time should depend on the type of interaction
and is diﬀerent for elastic and inelastic collisions [27, 28].
In this paper we show that the formula (1) can be
naturally generalised to the situation where the elastic
and inelastic processes are characterised by two diﬀerent
timescales, τel and τin, respectively. The newly proposed
equation is solved in the case of simple one-dimensional
expansion to demonstrate that the obtained solutions ex-
hibit behaviour expected in the situations characterised
by diﬀerent relations between the relaxation times τel and
τin.

We note that in high-energy processes the number of
particles is not conserved, hence, the chemical potential
µ is not taken into account. It is replaced by the baryon
chemical potential µB in the situations where one deals
with diﬀerent particle species that have diﬀerent baryon
numbers.
In the present work we show that it makes
sense to introduce the eﬀective chemical potential in the
situations where we have two diﬀerent timescales for elas-
tic and inelastic processes (even for simple, one compo-
nent systems). Depending on the mutual relations be-
tween τel, τin, and the system’s evolution time τ , the ef-
fective chemical potential may vanish or gain a non-zero
value.

The structure of the paper is as follows: In Sec. II we
deﬁne the new form of the RTA kinetic equation that

II. GENERALISED RTA KINETIC EQUATION

allows for separation of elastic and inelastic processes.
In Sec. III we consider one-dimensional boost-invariant
expansion and present formal, analytic solutions of the
new kinetic equation in this case. The results of numer-
ical calculations for the one-dimensional expansion are
presented in Sec. IV. We conclude and discuss possible
future applications of our approach in Sec. V.

Notation and conventions: Throught the paper we use
natural units with c = ¯h = kB = 1. We also use the nota-
tion p = (E, p⊥, p(cid:107)) for the four-momentum of a particle,
and p⊥ = |p⊥|. The invariant integration measure in the
momentum space gd3p/((2π)3E), with g being the in-
ternal degeneracy factor, is denoted shortly as dP . The
metric tensor has the signature (+,−,−,−). The scalar
product of two four-vectors a and b is denoted as a · b.
For sake of simplicity, we consider the case of massless
particles, setting m = 0.

A. Kinetic equation

In this work we propose to use the kinetic equation

with the collision term C of the form

pµ∂µf (x, p) = C[f (x, p)],

(cid:20) feq(µ, T ) − f

τel

feq(0, T ) − f

τin

+

(cid:21)

(3)

.

(4)

C[f ] = p · u

The quantities τel and τin are the relaxation times charac-
terising elastic (particle number conserving) and inelas-
tic (particle number changing) processes, respectively. In
general, τel and τin may depend on x and p. In this work,
we restrict our considerations to the case where τel and
τin are both constant.

The equilibrium distribution function feq may be taken
to be a Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac, or Boltzmann distri-
bution. These three cases correspond to the form

(cid:20)

(cid:18) p · u − µ

(cid:19)

(cid:21)−1

− 

feq(µ, T ) =

exp

T
with  = 1,−1 and 0, respectively.

In our notation we display only thermodynamic argu-
ments of the equilibrium functions to emphasise that the
term describing elastic (inelastic) processes has feq with
ﬁnite (vanishing) chemical potential. The dependence of
feq on momentum and space-time coordinates (through
µ(x), T (x), and u(x)) is not shown.

The idea behind proposing the form (3) is that it natu-
rally describes the tendency of a system to approach local
equilibrium — inelastic processes lead to local equilib-
rium deﬁned by the temperature only, while elastic pro-
cesses lead to equilibrium described by the temperature
and chemical potential.

B. Energy-momentum conservation

Using Eqs. (3), (4), and the standard deﬁnition of the
energy-momentum tensor as the second moment of the
distribution function, namely

(cid:90)

T µν =

dP pµpνf,

(6)

we ﬁnd that the energy is conserved, ∂µT µν = 0, if the
following condition is satisﬁed

Equation (7) can be treated as a generalised Landau

the analysis of the particle number current

Using again Eqs. (3) and (4) we ﬁnd

The right-hand side of Eq. (11) describes the pro-
duction of particles due to the presence of elastic and
inelastic processes. Although we cannot assume that
∂µN µ = 0, we should require that elastic processes do
not contribute to the particle production, hence we use
the condition

Equation (16) is the second Landau matching condi-
tion, which together with Eq. (7) allows us to determine
both T and µ. We note that ε and n appearing on the
left-hand sides of Eqs. (7) and (16) are non equilibrium
quantities, so T and µ are an alternative way to deﬁne ε
and n.

At this point we want to stress that Eqs. (3), (7), and
(16) represent a complete system of three equations that
deﬁne our framework. In the remaining part of this sec-
tion, we discuss its main properties.

If the evolution time of the system τ is much larger

than the two relaxation times,

τel, τin (cid:28) τ,

(17)

one expects that the system approaches local equilibrium
state where the right-hand side of the kinetic equation (3)
vanishes. In this case the distribution function has the
form

fst(µ, T ) =

feq(µ, T )τin + feq(0, T )τel

τin + τel

.

(18)

Using (18) one may check that the Landau matching for
the energy density (7) is automatically fulﬁlled, but from
the Landau matching for the particle number density (16)
one gets

(cid:0) µ

T

(cid:1) τin + χn(0)τel

χn

τin + τel

(cid:16) µ

(cid:17)

T

Equation (19) implies directly that the asymptotic equi-
librium state is achieved only with µ = 0. This prop-
erty reﬂects the fact that inelastic processes are present
in the system, and for suﬃciently large evolution times,
see (17), they force µ to vanish.

Similar situation happens if the evolution time is much

larger than τin but shorter than τel,
τin (cid:28) τ (cid:28) τel.

(20)

In this case the system is very close to the equilibrium
state determined by particle changing processes (note
that taking a formal limit τin → 0 in (19) one imme-
diately ﬁnds µ = 0).

and

This corresponds to the situation where the system is
dominated by elastic collisions. Taking the limit τel → 0
in (19) one ﬁnds that this equation is always fulﬁlled.

For the evolution time τ satisfying Eq. (21) the sys-
tem behaves almost like a perfect ﬂuid. The parameters
T and µ are determined by the hydrodynamic equations.
In this case the number of particles and entropy are both
conserved, hence we can write ∂µN µ = 0 and ∂µSµ = 0,
where N µ = nuµ and Sµ = suµ. For massless parti-
cles the entropy density s is connected with the particle
density through the relation

s = 4n

.

(22)

Consequently, the conservation laws for the particle num-
ber and entropy lead to the condition

Thus,
for the system dominated by elastic collisions,
see (21), we expect that the ratio µ/T is constant along
the world lines of ﬂuid elements.

III. BOOST-INVARIANT EXPANSION

A.

Implementation of the symmetry constraints

√

In the case of one-dimensional boost-invariant expan-
sion, all scalar functions of time and space depend only
t2 − z2, and the hydrodynamic
on the proper time τ =
ﬂow has the form uµ = (t/τ, 0, 0, z/τ ) [29].
In addi-
tion, the phase-space densities behave like scalars under
Lorentz transformations, hence, f (x, p) may depend only
on: τ , w and p⊥, where w = tp(cid:107) − zE [30, 31]. Using w
and p⊥ we deﬁne another convenient variable

(cid:113)

Thus, the momentum integration measure dP in phase-
space may be written as

dP =

g dp(cid:107) d2p⊥

(2π)3E

f (τ,−w, p⊥).

(31)

Here we use the notation µ(cid:48) = µ(τ(cid:48)), T (cid:48) = T (τ(cid:48)).

B. Energy-momentum conservation and particle

number conservation in elastic processes

Using the symmetry properties discussed in the previ-

ous section, we may rewrite (6) in the form [36, 37]
T µν = (ε + P⊥)uµuν − P⊥gµν + (P(cid:107) − P⊥)zµzν ,

(32)

is the longitudinal pressure, and

(cid:90)

P⊥(τ ) =

(35)

is the transverse pressure. In (32) zµ = (z/τ, 0, 0, t/τ ) is
the four-vector orthogonal to uµ which deﬁnes the longi-
tudinal direction.

The energy-momentum conservation law is expressed
by the vanishing divergence of the energy-momentum
tensor ∂µT µν(x) = 0. In our case these four equations
are reduced to the condition

(36)

Calculating the proper time derivative of the energy den-
sity deﬁned by Eq. (33) and using Eqs. (28), (34), and
(36) we ﬁnd the formula

special case of the Landau matching condition for en-
ergy (7).

Similarly to the energy conservation, we can discuss
the particle number conservation by elastic processes.

Equations (40) and (41) are two integral equations for
two functions of the proper time: T (τ ) and µ(τ ). They
can be solved by the iterative method [38]: One substi-
tutes auxiliary functions T (τ ) and µ(τ ) into the right-
hand sides of (40) and (41) to obtain new time proﬁles
T (τ ) and µ(τ ) from the left-hand sides, which are again
inserted into the right-hand sides. Repeating this proce-
dure, we approach the stable results which do not change
after iteration and represent the solutions of (40) and
(41).

Bose-Einstein case. The overall change of the µ/T ratio
is rather small (µ/T at the minimum reaches -0.03). As
expected, due to the presence of inelastic processes, the
eﬀective chemical potential tends to zero for large evolu-
tion times.

Similar situation to that shown in Fig. 1 takes place if
τin = 0.25 fm and τel = 100 fm, see Fig. 2. In this case
the inelastic processes play a dominant role. The temper-
ature proﬁles found for diﬀerent statistics are practically
the same as those found in the case τin = τel = 0.5 fm.
The ratio µ/T becomes again negative at the beginning
of the evolution, but the eﬀect is smaller than that found
in the case τin = τel = 0.5 fm (due to a smaller value
of the inelastic collision time, which keeps the system
always close to chemical equilibrium with µ = 0).

An interesting situation takes place in the case
τel = 0.25 fm and τin = 100 fm, see Fig. 3. For the
evolution times of about a few fermis the system dynam-
ics is dominated by elastic processes. We observe much
larger increase of the eﬀective temperature (compared
to the Bjorken scenario) accompanied with a signiﬁcant
decrease of the µ/T ratio towards negative values (the
value at the minimum reaches -0.36). The results do de-
pend on the statistics of particles; the strongest eﬀects
are for the Fermi-Dirac case, and the smallest are for
the Bose-Einstein case. For τ > 3 fm, the ratio µ/T is
approximately ﬂat, which reﬂects local equilibrium state
described by the hydrodynamic equation (23).

It is also interesting to realise that in all studied cases
the initial non-equilibrium dynamics leads to a relative
increase of T (compared to Bjorken scaling) and decrease
of the ratio µ/T . This seems to be undesirable situation
in the context of possible creation of the gluon condensate
in heavy-ion collisions [39–44], which may lead in turn to
pion condensate [45, 46]. A signal for the creation of the
condensate would be a growth of the chemical potential
and reaching the critical value, which is zero in our case
(we deal with massless particles). Although we start with
the critical value, we ﬁnd no numerical evidence that µ/T
grows with time. Contrary, this ratio ﬁrst decreases and
only later approaches slowly zero from below. We note
that the decrease of µ/T is the largest in the case where
the system is dominated by elastic collisions — such sit-
uation would naively favour the creation of the conden-
sate. Certainly, to complete the picture of condensation
further processes and eﬀects should be included such as
particle production and momentum dependent relaxation
times. This would be an interesting development of the
framework introduced in this work.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

In this paper we have introduced a modiﬁed form of
the relaxation-time-approximation for the collision term
in the Boltzmann equation that allows for separation of
elastic and inelastic collisions. We have showed how it
can be supplemented consistently by Landau matching

and τin = 100 fm.

is to illustrate diﬀerent scenarios discussed earlier in
Sec. II. Our initial conditions are set at the initial proper
time τ0 = 0.5 fm. They correspond to the equilibrium
distribution of the form (29) with initial temperature
T0 = 600 MeV and initial chemical potential µ0 = 0. We
continue the time evolution of the system till τ = 5 fm.
In Fig. 1 we show our results obtained for the case
τin = τel = 0.5 fm. The red dashed, blue dotted-dashed,
and green dotted lines describe the results obtained for
Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Bose-Einstein statistics, re-
spectively. The solid line in the upper panel shows, for
the reference, the Bjorken solution for the temperature
proﬁle, T = T0(τ0/τ )1/3. We observe that the non-
equilibrium behaviour at the beginning of the evolution
makes the temperature higher than that found in the
Bjorken scenario, while the chemical potential (scaled by
the temperature) becomes ﬁrst negative and later ap-
proaches zero. The results for the eﬀective temperature
are practically independent of the quantum statistics as-
sumed in the calculations. On the other hand, the re-
sults for the chemical potential vary with statistics — the
largest change of the µ/T ratio is found for the Fermi-
Dirac statistics, while the smallest change is found for the

The proposed scheme oﬀers multiple applications in
the situations where one wants to study consequences of
having two diﬀerent relaxation times for elastic and in-
elastic collisions, but one does not want to invoke the
whole machinery of the kinetic theory with complicated
collision integrals. The list of possible extra eﬀects that
may be taken into account includes: ﬁnite masses of par-
ticles, mixtures, color mean ﬁelds, momentum dependent
relaxation times, and source terms. The new form of the

collision term may be used to derive new equations of dis-
sipative and anisotropic hydrodynamics. Moreover, with
the inclusion of source terms descrybing particle produc-
tion, it may be possible to study conditions allowing for
Bose-Einstein condensation.
