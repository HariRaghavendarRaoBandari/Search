Linear structures on locales∗

Pedro Resende and Jo˜ao Paulo Santos

Abstract

We deﬁne a notion of morphism for quotient vector bundles that yields both a category QVBun
and a contravariant global sections functor C : QVBunop → Vect whose restriction to trivial vector
bundles with ﬁber F coincides with the contravariant functor Topop → Vect of F -valued continuous
functions. Based on this we obtain a linear extension of the adjunction between the categories of
topological spaces and locales: (i) a linearized topological space is a spectral vector bundle, by which
is meant a mildly restricted type of quotient vector bundle; (ii) a linearized locale is a locale △
equipped with both a topological vector space A and a △-valued support map for the elements of A
satisfying a continuity condition relative to the spectrum of △ and the lower Vietoris topology on
Sub A; (iii) we obtain an adjunction between the full subcategory of spectral vector bundles QVBunΣ
and the category of linearized locales LinLoc, which restricts to an equivalence of categories between
sober spectral vector bundles and spatial linearized locales. The spectral vector bundles are classiﬁed
by a ﬁner topology on Sub A, called the open support topology, but there is no notion of universal
spectral vector bundle for an arbitrary topological vector space A.

Keywords: Quotient vector bundles, locales, Banach bundles, lower Vietoris topology, Fell topology.

A quotient vector bundle [8] over a topological space X is a triple (π, A, q) that consists of a ﬁberwise
linear quotient of a trivial complex vector bundle π2 : A × X → X by an open map q, where A can be

which in particular does not have to be locally trivial and can have variable or inﬁnite rank.

Such a bundle has enough sections in the sense that for any e ∈ E there is a continuous section
s : X → E such that e = s(π(e)); for each e = q(a, π(e)) just take s to be the section ˆa deﬁned by ˆa(x) =
q(a, x) for all x ∈ X. As an example, any Banach bundle π : E → X on a locally compact Hausdorﬀ
space X can be made a quotient vector bundle by taking A to be the space C0(π) of continuous sections
that vanish at inﬁnity, with the supremum norm topology, where q : C0(X) × X → E is the evaluation
map q(s, x) = eval(s, x) = s(x).

Quotient vector bundles are classiﬁed by continuous maps κ : X → Sub A, where Sub A is the set
of all the linear subspaces of A topologized with the lower Vietoris topology [6, 11] (with subclasses
of bundles being classiﬁed by ﬁner topologies such as the Fell topology). We shall refer to Sub A as
the spectrum of the topological vector space A. An aspect of Sub A has been ignored in [8], namely
its complete lattice structure, which has an important role to play. In order to introduce this idea, for
each continuous section s of π let us write supp◦ s to denote the interior of the support of s,

and let us consider two maps,

supp◦ s = int{x ∈ X | s(x) 6= 0} ,

σ : Sub A → Ω(X) ,
γ : Ω(X) → Sub A ,

respectively called support map and restriction map, where Ω(X) is the topology of X. These maps
are deﬁned, for all V ∈ Sub A and U ∈ Ω(X), by

σ(V ) = [

a∈V

supp◦ ˆa ;

γ(U ) = {a ∈ A | supp◦ ˆa ⊂ U } .

The topology Ω(X) is another complete lattice under inclusion of open sets, and it is clear that we
have an equivalence

σ(V ) ⊂ U ⇐⇒ V ⊂ γ(U )

for all V ∈ Sub A and U ∈ Ω(X). This means that the support map is left adjoint to the restriction
map, and it immediately follows that they preserve suprema and inﬁma, respectively:

σ(cid:0)X
γ(cid:0)int\

α

α

Vα(cid:1) = [
Uα(cid:1) = \

α

α

σ(Vα) ,

γ(Uα) .

We shall regard the triple (A, σ, γ) as a structure on the locale Ω(X) in its own right, and, accord-
ingly, we shall deﬁne the notion of linearized locale A = (△, A, σ, γ) to consist of a locale △ together
with a topological vector space A and a map σ : Sub A → △ with right adjoint γ, such that the
restriction of γ to the prime spectrum Σ(△) of △ is a continuous map into Sub A. The latter means
that the restricted map is the kernel map of a quotient vector bundle, called the spectrum Σ(A) of the
linearized locale. This will be seen to be a quotient vector bundle of a special kind, in particular such
that for all a ∈ A the set

{p ∈ Σ(△) | ˆa(p) 6= 0}

is open and thus coincides with the open support supp◦ ˆa.

We shall see that from each quotient vector bundle A = (π : E → X, A, q) we obtain a linearized
locale Ω(A) = (Ω(X), A, σ, γ) as described above provided that the above openness condition holds
with △ = Ω(X) for all a ∈ A, together with an additional continuity condition related to the spectrum
of the locale Ω(X): the restriction of γ to the prime spectrum Σ Ω(X) must be continuous. Hence,
such quotient vector bundles will be termed spectral (quotient) vector bundles.

We shall also compare spectral vector bundles and linearized locales by looking at Σ Ω(A) and
Ω Σ(A) for each spectral vector bundle A and each linearized locale A. In some cases we may obtain

2

A ∼= Σ Ω(A) and A ∼= Ω Σ(A) according to obvious notions of isomorphism, but this leaves out many
examples which, despite not yielding such isomorphisms, nevertheless ought to be comparable. Hence,
in order to obtain a more satisfactory understanding of how quotient vector bundles and linearized
locales relate, we shall deﬁne appropriate notions of morphism for both. In particular, our morphisms
of bundles will diﬀer from typical morphisms of vector bundles, which often consist of pairs of maps
(f0, f1) that yield commutative squares

but do not behave well with respect to global sections, whereas the morphisms in this paper will be
such that f : ρ → π yields a contravariant linear map f ∗ : C(π) → C(ρ) on the spaces of global sections
that in the case of trivial line bundles agrees with the contravariant Gelfand duality functor. Using
these morphisms we shall obtain an adjunction between the category of spectral vector bundles and
that of linearized locales, where Ω is left adjoint to Σ, which extends the classical adjunction between
topological spaces and locales whereby the topology functor Ω is left adjoint to the spectrum functor Σ
[3]. Similarly to classical locale theory, we shall ﬁnd corresponding notions of spatial linearized locale
and of sober spectral vector bundles, and conclude that their respective categories are equivalent.

At the end of the paper we also show that the spectral vector bundles on suitable topological
spaces X (for instance sober spaces) are classiﬁed by the continuous maps κ : X → Sub◦ A, where
Sub◦ A is the set Sub A with a topology herein called the open support topology, which sits between
the lower Vietoris and the Fell topologies. However, for other spaces X the quotient vector bundles
that correspond to continuous maps κ : X → Sub◦ A may fail to be spectral. In particular, in general
there is no notion of universal spectral vector bundle for an arbitrary topological vector space A. In
order to obtain some of these results we study the prime open sets of various topologies on Sub A, in
particular yielding a result of interest in its own right, namely that if A is a locally convex space then
Max A, the space of closed linear subspaces of A with the lower Vietoris topology, is a sober space.

Linearized locales are “quotient vector bundles on locales”. We note that this is not a full-ﬂedged
localic notion, since it is formulated in terms of topological vector spaces. It is in principle possible
to give a fully localic deﬁnition by considering localic vector spaces instead, and subsequently deﬁning
Sub A to be a localic sup-lattice as in [9]. However, we are not following such an approach, at least
for now, because the motivation for our project stems from speciﬁc questions related to C*-algebra
“diagonals” as in [5, 7], which we want to address without transforming them into questions about
localic C*-algebras. Moreover, this choice will enable us to take advantage of quantale theory when
studying Sub A for a C*-algebra A, without ﬁrst having to develop a theory of localic quantales.

2 Preliminaries on vector bundles

We recall basic deﬁnitions from [8] in order to ﬁx terminology and notation. Throughout this paper
all the vector spaces are over C, and topological vector spaces satisfy no speciﬁc topological properties
unless otherwise stated. Topological vector spaces satisfying the T1 axiom are necessarily Hausdorﬀ
(in fact completely regular), and we refer to them as Hausdorﬀ vector spaces. Such a space is ﬁnite
dimensional if and only if it is locally compact, in which case it necessarily has the Euclidean topology.
We denote by Vect (resp. TopVect) the category of vector spaces and linear maps (resp. continuous
linear maps).

2.1 Linear bundles

Basic facts and deﬁnitions. Let π : E → X be a continuous map between topological spaces E
and X. For each x ∈ X we refer to the set π−1({x}) as the ﬁber over x and denote it by Ex.

By a linear structure on π will be meant a structure of vector space on each ﬁber Ex such that the
operations of scalar multiplication and vector addition are globally continuous when regarded as maps
C × E → E and E ×X E → E, respectively, and such that the zero section of π, which sends each
x ∈ X to 0x (the zero of Ex) is continuous. Hence, π equipped with a linear structure is a very loose
form of vector bundle, which we refer to as a linear bundle, the map π itself being called its projection.
The set C(π) of continuous sections of π is vector space with the pointwise linear structure. The

bundle is said to have enough sections if the evaluation map eval : C(π) × X → E is surjective.

If A is a topological vector space, the projection π2 : A × X → X will be called a trivial linear
bundle. Its space of continuous sections, C(π2), is linearly isomorphic to the vector space of continuous
functions C(X; A).

Pullbacks. Let π : E → X be a linear bundle, and let

f : Y → X

be a continuous map. The pullback of π along f deﬁnes a linear bundle

f ∗(π) = π2 : E ×X Y → Y .

The pullback along f induces contravariantly a linear map on continuous sections,

by, for all s ∈ C(π) and y ∈ Y ,

s 7→ f ∗(s) : C(π) → C(π2) ,

f ∗(s)(y) = (s(f (y)), y) .

Morphisms over ﬁxed base space. The category LinBun(X) of linear bundles over X has as
morphisms

(ρ : F → X)

f
→ (π : E → X)

the continuous and ﬁberwise linear maps f : F → E that commute with the projections:

Such a morphism induces a linear map s 7→ f∗(s) : C(ρ) → C(π) by postcomposition: f∗(s) = f ◦ s.

2.2 Quotient vector bundles

Basic deﬁnition and facts. By a quotient vector bundle is meant a triple A = (π, A, q) where
π : E → X is a linear bundle, A is a topological vector space, and q is a continuous open surjection
that deﬁnes a morphism in LinBun(X):

A × X

For each x ∈ X we denote by qx : A → Ex the continuous map deﬁned for all a ∈ A by

qx(a) = q(a, x) .

This is a continuous open linear surjection, and thus every ﬁber Ex is a quotient of A as a topological
vector space. Moreover, the quotient topology on Ex coincides with the relative topology of Ex as a
subspace of E.

Sections. For each a ∈ A we have a continuous section of π,

which is deﬁned for all x ∈ X by

ˆa : X → E ,

ˆa(x) = q(a, x) .

Every e ∈ E is of this form, and thus quotient vector bundles have enough sections. The map

d(−) : A → C(π) thus deﬁned is linear, and therefore its image bA with the quotient topology is a

quotient topological vector space of A. The kernel of the quotient map is the radical of A:

rad A = \

the quotient vector bundle (f ∗(π), A, f ∗(q)) such that for all a ∈ A and y ∈ Y the continuous open
surjection f ∗(q) : A × Y → E ×X Y is deﬁned by

f ∗(q)(a, y) = (q(a, f (y)), y) .

Classifying spaces and universal bundles. We denote by Sub A the collection of all the linear
subspaces of A topologized with the lower Vietoris topology [6, 8, 11], which is generated by the sub
basis whose open sets are, for each open set U ⊂ A,

We refer to Sub A as the spectrum of A. The kernel map of A is the continuous map

eU = {P ∈ Sub A | P ∩ U 6= ∅} .

κ : X → Sub A

which is deﬁned for all x ∈ X by κ(x) = ker qx.

Quotient vector bundles are classiﬁed by their kernel maps: from any continuous map

κ : X → Sub A

we obtain a quotient vector bundle (π : E → X, A, q) such that E is the quotient of A × X by the
equivalence relation ∼ which is deﬁned for all x, y ∈ X and a, b ∈ A by

(a, x) ∼ (b, y) ⇐⇒ (x = y and a − b ∈ κ(x)) .

Then q : A × X → E is the quotient map and π is the factorization of π2 : A × X → X through q.
The kernel map of this bundle is κ.

If κ : X → Sub A is the kernel map of a quotient vector bundle (π : E → X, A, q) the construction
just described yields a quotient vector bundle (π′ : E′ → X, A, q′) such that π is isomorphic to π′ in
LinBun(X) via an isomorphism i : E → E′ that also commutes with q and q′.

Finally we refer to the bundle obtained in this way from the identity map ι : Sub A → Sub A as
the universal quotient vector bundle for A, and denote it by U A = (πA : EA → Sub A, A, qA). Every
quotient vector bundle for A arises, up to an isomorphism as just described, as the pullback of U A
along the kernel map of the bundle.

3 Categories of vector bundles

In this section we study morphisms, over variable base space, of linear bundles and of quotient vector
bundles, keeping in mind the general aim of obtaining a contravariant global sections functor. Hence,
we refer informally to the resulting categories as Gelfand categories of vector bundles.

3.1 The Gelfand category of linear bundles

Covariant morphisms. Let ρ : F → Y and π : E → X be linear bundles. There is more than one
way in which one can deﬁne a morphism from ρ to π. An obvious choice is to let a morphism consist
of a pair of continuous maps f0 : Y → X and f1 : F → E such that the following diagram commutes
and f1 is ﬁberwise linear,

F

ρ

Y

f1

f0

E

π

/ X

with composition deﬁned by (g0, g1) ◦ (f0, f1) = (g0 ◦ f0, g1 ◦ f1). We call such a morphism covariant.
The sections of the bundles do not behave well with respect to such morphisms unless further
conditions are imposed, such as requiring f1 to be ﬁberwise a homeomorphism, as in [10]. In order
to see this, we note that f1 determines a unique continuous map f ′
1 that makes the following diagram
commute:

F

f ′

1

f1

E ×X Y

ρ

π2

Y

π1

f0

/ E

π

/ X

The map f ′
be deﬁned equivalently to be the pair (f0, f ′

1).

1 is a morphism in LinBun(Y ) and f1 is determined by it, so a covariant morphism could

1 yields a linear map (f ′
The map f ′
1)∗ : C(ρ) → C(π2) on sections, whereas the pullback gives us
a linear map f ∗
0 : C(π) → C(π2). So we do not in general obtain a map relating C(ρ) and C(π).
However, a notion of morphism that pulls back sections can be obtained by reversing the direction of
f ′
1, as we shall see next.

Contravariant morphisms. Let ρ : F → Y and π : E → X be linear bundles. By a contravariant
morphism f : ρ → π is meant a pair of continuous maps (f♭, f ♯) such that f ♯ : f ∗
♭ (π) → ρ is a morphism
in LinBun(Y ), as follows:

F

ρ

f ♯

In order to compose such morphisms one should think of the pair (f ♯, π1) as a “binary relation” between
F and E (a span), and composition should be deﬁned accordingly as composition of spans by pullback:

Although composition of spans is in general deﬁned only up to isomorphism, there is a deﬁnition
for contravariant morphisms which is associative “on the nose”. Let σ : G → Z, ρ : F → Y , and
π : E → X be linear bundles, with contravariant morphisms as follows:

σ

g

/ ρ

f

/ π

Then the composition f ◦ g is the pair (f♭ ◦ g♭, (f ◦ g)♯), where (f ◦ g)♯ : E ×X Z → G is deﬁned, for
all e ∈ E and z ∈ Z, by

(3.1)

(f ◦ g)♯(e, z) = g♯(f ♯(e, g♭(z)), z) .

We note that this deﬁnition depends on all the four continuous maps involved. This is explicit in (3.1)
for g♭, g♯, and f ♯, and the dependence on f♭ is via the deﬁnition of the pullback E ×X Z:

E ×X Z

π1

π2

Z

f♭◦g♭

E

π

/ X

It is now straightforward to verify that the composition is associative and that the following identity
morphism on π : E → X is a neutral element for composition both on the right and on the left:

idπ = (idX, π1 : E ×X X

∼=→ E) .

We refer to the resulting category as the Gelfand category of linear bundles, and denote it by LinBun.
A morphism f is an isomorphism in this category if and only if both f♭ and f ♯ are homeomorphisms.
Note that there is always a contravariant morphism (f, id) : f ∗(π) → π.

We remark that for each topological vector space A there is a faithful functor BA : Top → LinBun

that to each topological space X assigns the trivial bundle

BA(X) = π2 : A × X → X

and to each continuous map f : Y → X assigns the contravariant morphism

BA(f ) = (f, (A × X) ×X Y

∼=→ A × Y ) .

Functoriality of sections. Let ρ : F → Y and π : E → X be linear bundles, and f : ρ → π a
contravariant morphism. The composition

f ∗ := f ♯

∗ ◦ f ∗

♭ : C(π) → C(ρ)

is a linear map, and thus we have a contravariant functor

C : LinBunop → Vect

deﬁned on linear bundles π and contravariant morphisms f by

π 7→ C(π) ,

f

7→ f ∗ .

This generalizes, for each topological vector space A, the contravariant functor

C(−; A) : Topop → Vect

in the sense that C(−; A) = C ◦ BA.

We note that if f : ρ → π is a morphism in LinBun and π has enough sections then f ♯ is uniquely

determined by f♭ and f ∗, since for all (e, y) ∈ E ×X Y we have e = s(f♭(y)) for some s ∈ C(π) and

(3.2)

f ♯(e, y) = f ♯(s(f♭(y)), y) = f ♯

∗(f ∗

♭ (s))(y) = f ∗(s)(y) .

3.2 The category of quotient vector bundles

Contravariant morphisms revisited. Let A = (π : E → X, A, q) and B = (ρ : F → Y, B, r) be
quotient vector bundles. By a morphism f : B → A will be meant a contravariant morphism of linear
bundles (f♭, f ♯) : ρ → π together with a continuous linear map f ∗ : A → B such that, now writing
ˆf : C(π) → C(ρ) for the map on sections induced by the contravariant morphism (f♭, f ♯), the following
diagram commutes:

(3.3)

B

d(−) 
bB

f ∗

ˆf

A

d(−)
bA

In particular, this implies the following condition on radicals:

(3.4)

f ∗(rad A) ⊂ rad B .

These morphisms form a category QVBun, which we refer to as the category of quotient vector

bundles:

• The composition f ◦ g is the pair consisting of the contravariant morphism (f♭, f ♯) ◦ (g♭, g♯)

together with the continuous linear map g∗ ◦ f ∗;

• The identity morphism on A = (π : A → X, A, q) is the identity contravariant morphism on π

together with idA.

We note that a morphism f in this category is an isomorphism if and only if its three components are
homeomorphisms.

Lemma 3.1 Let A = (π : E → X, A, q) and B = (ρ : F → Y, B, r) be quotient vector bundles. If
f : B → A is a morphism in QVBun then f ♯ is uniquely deﬁned for all a ∈ A and y ∈ Y by

f ♯(q(a, f♭(y)) = r(f ∗(a), y) .

Proof.

For all (e, y) ∈ E ×X Y we have e = ˆa(f♭(y)) for some a ∈ A and thus, by (3.2) and (3.3),

f ♯(q(a, f♭(y)) = f ♯(e, y) = ˆf (ˆa)(y) = \f ∗(a)(y) = r(f ∗(a), y) .

Equivalent deﬁnition of morphism. From 3.1 it follows that if f = (f♭, f ♯, f ∗) is a morphism of
quotient vector bundles then the following condition, relating f♭ and f ∗, must hold for all a ∈ A and
y ∈ Y :

(3.5)

q(a, f♭(y)) = 0 =⇒ r(f ∗(a), y) = 0 .

There is a converse to this:

Lemma 3.2 Let A = (π : E → X, A, q) and B = (ρ : F → Y, B, r) be quotient vector bundles. Every
pair of maps

f♭
f ∗

: Y → X (continuous)
: A → B (continuous linear)

satisfying (3.5) arises from a morphism f = (f♭, f ♯, f ∗) in QVBun for a unique map f ♯.

Proof. Condition (3.5) implies that we may deﬁne a ﬁberwise linear map

f ♯ : E ×X Y → F

for all y ∈ Y and e ∈ Ef♭(y) by

(3.6)

f ♯(e, y) = r(f ∗(a), y) ,

where a ∈ A is any element of A such that q(a, f♭(y)) = e. In other words, f ♯ is the unique map that
makes the following diagram commute:

B × Y

f ∗×id

A × Y

∼=o

(A × X) ×X Y

r

F

f ♯

q×id

E ×X Y

Now q × id is a quotient map because it is open and surjective. Therefore f ♯ is continuous, and thus
we have a contravariant morphism (f♭, f ♯) : ρ → π.

Next we show that the triple f = (f♭, f ♯, f ∗) is a morphism in QVBun. Let a ∈ A and y ∈ Y . We

have ˆf = f ♯

∗ ◦ f ∗

♭ , and thus, letting e = q(a, f♭(y)) in (3.6), we obtain
\f ∗(a)(y) = r(f ∗(a), y) = f ♯(q(a, f♭(y)), y) = f ♯(ˆa(f♭(y)), y) = ˆf (ˆa)(y) ,

showing that (3.3) holds.

Hence, we see that the morphisms of quotient vector bundles can be deﬁned alternatively but

equivalently to be pairs (f♭, f ∗) satisfying (3.5), with f ♯ being derived from the formula in 3.1:

f ♯(q(a, f♭(y)) = r(f ∗(a), y) .

This formula further implies that f ♯ is ﬁberwise injective if and only if for all a ∈ A and y ∈ Y we have

(3.7)

q(a, f♭(y)) = 0 ⇐⇒ r(f ∗(a), y) = 0 .

A morphism of quotient vector bundles such that the former condition holds is called strict, whereas if
only the implication (3.5) holds it is called lax. The strict morphisms yield a subcategory of quotient
vector bundles, which we refer to as the strict category of quotient vector bundles, denoted by sQVBun.

4 Preliminaries on pointfree topology

In this section we provide some background on sup-lattices and locales. More details can be found for
instance in [3, 4].

4.1 Sup-lattices

Basic deﬁnitions and examples. By a sup-lattice [4, Ch. I] will be meant a partially ordered set

L for which any subset S has a join (supremum), which is denoted by W S or sup S. Similarly, we
write Wα aα or supα aα for the join of an indexed family (aα) in L. Sup-lattices necessarily have meets
(inﬁma) of every subset (denoted by V S or inf S), but the terminology we adopt reﬂects (as opposed

to “complete lattice”) the fact that joins are the ﬁrst-class algebraic operations in the sense that they
are preserved by homomorphisms f : L → M :

f (cid:16)_ S(cid:17) = _ f (S) .

The category of sup-lattices SL is deﬁned to have sup-lattices as objects and homomorphisms as arrows.
Additionally, we adopt the usual notation from lattice theory for meets and joins of pairs of elements,

As examples of sup-lattices we mention:

sup-lattice homomorphism Sub f : Sub A → Sub B deﬁned by

and in this way one obtains a functor Sub : Vect → SL.

Sub f (V ) = f (V ) ,

3. The set of closed linear subspaces, Max A, of a topological vector space A. If (Vα) is a family

in Max A we have Wα Vα = Pα Vα and Vα Vα = Tα Vα. Any continuous linear map f : A → B

between topological vector spaces yields a sup-lattice homomorphism Max f : Max A → Max B
deﬁned by

and in this way one obtains a functor Max : TopVect → SL.

Max f (V ) = f (V ) ,

Adjunctions. Let L and M be sup-lattices. We write f ⊣ g in order to indicate that f is left adjoint
to g:

L

f

M

.

The pair (f, g) will be referred to as an adjunction from L to M .

Example 4.1 Let A and B be a complex vector spaces, and let f : A → B be a linear map. Recall
that Sub f is the sup-lattice homomorphism Sub A → Sub B deﬁned by Sub f (V ) = f (V ) for all
V ∈ Sub A. The right adjoint of Sub f is the inverse image map f −1 : Sub B → Sub A, as the following
equivalences show, where V ∈ Sub A and W ∈ Sub B:

Sub f (V ) ⊂ W ⇐⇒ f (V ) ⊂ W ⇐⇒ V ⊂ f −1(W ) .

We note that the bijection between sup-lattice homomorphisms and their right adjoints is an
antitone order isomorphism with respect to the pointwise order on maps: if both f ⊣ g and f ′ ⊣ g′ are
adjunctions from L to M then we have f ≤ f ′ ⇐⇒ g′ ≤ g.

4.2 Locales

Basic deﬁnitions and facts. A locale (see [3]) is a sup-lattice L satisfying the distributivity property

a ∧_

α

bα = _

α

a ∧ bα

for all a ∈ L and all families (bα) in L. The main example of a locale is the topology Ω(X) of a
topological space.

A homomorphism of locales h : L → M is a homomorphism of sup-lattices that also preserves ﬁnite

meets:

h(1L) = 1M

h(a ∧ b) = h(a) ∧ h(b) .

10

)
)
i
i
If f : X → Y is a continuous map of topological spaces the inverse image mapping

f −1 : Ω(Y ) → Ω(X)

is a homomorphism of locales.

The category of locales Loc is deﬁned to be the category whose objects are the locales and whose
arrows M → L, referred to as (continuous) maps of locales, are the homomorphisms of locales in
the opposite direction, L → M . If f : M → L is a map of locales, the homomorphism that deﬁnes
it is referred to as the inverse image homomorphism of f and it is denoted by f ∗. The assignment
X 7→ Ω(X) deﬁnes a functor

Ω : Top → Loc

such that for each continuous map of topological spaces f : X → Y we have

(Ω f )∗ = f −1 .

We also note that the inverse image homomorphism of a map of locales f : M → L preserves joins and
thus there is a meet preserving map (the right adjoint of f ∗)

which is deﬁned by, for all b ∈ M ,

f∗ : M → L ,

f∗(b) = _{a ∈ L | f ∗(a) ≤ b} .

If f : X → Y is a continuous open map between topological spaces then we denote by f! : Ω(X) → Ω(Y )
the direct image homomorphism of f : f!(U ) = f (U ). This is a sup-lattice homomorphism, left adjoint
to f −1 : Ω(Y ) → Ω(X).

Points and prime elements. A point of a locale L is usually deﬁned to be a map x : Ω → L, where
Ω = ℘({∗}) is the topology of a singleton. Although locale theory is often meant to be applied in a
constructive setting (i.e., in an arbitrary topos), classically Ω is just a two element chain {0, 1} with
0 < 1, and the set of points x is in bijective correspondence with the set of elements of the form

_ ker x∗ = _{a ∈ L | x∗(a) = 0} .

These elements are precisely the prime elements of L, where an element p ∈ L of a locale L is said to
be prime if it satisﬁes the following two conditions for all a, b ∈ L:

p

6= 1

a ∧ b ≤ p ⇒ a ≤ p or b ≤ p .

For the purposes of this paper it will be useful to identify the points of a locale L with its prime
elements, and we denote the set of the latter by Σ(L).

The following simple fact will be used later:

Lemma 4.2 Let X be a topological space with a subbasis S. Any prime element P ∈ ΩX is a union
of subbasic open sets.

Proof.
Since P is prime, x ∈ Si ⊂ P for some i.

For any x ∈ P there are subbasic open sets S1, . . . , Sk ∈ S such that x ∈ S1 ∩ · · · ∩ Sk ⊂ P .

11

The spectrum of a locale. For each a ∈ L, where L is a locale, we deﬁne the following set,

and the following conditions hold:

Ua = {p ∈ Σ(L) | a (cid:2) p} ,

U1 = Σ(L) ;

Ua∧b = Ua ∩ Ub ;
Uaα .

UWα aα = [

α

Hence, the collection (Ua)a∈L deﬁnes a topology Ω Σ(L) on Σ(L). The set of primes equipped with
this topology will be called the spectrum of the locale L. The assignment a 7→ Ua is a homomorphism
of locales that deﬁnes a map of locales spatL : Ω Σ(L) → L called the spatialization of L. A locale is
called spatial if its spatialization map is an isomorphism. This is equivalent to the statement that L is
isomorphic to the topology of some topological space.

The spectrum functor.

If f : M → L is a map of locales we obtain a continuous map

Σ(f ) : Σ(M ) → Σ(L)

which coincides with the restriction of f∗ to Σ(M ):

Σ(f )(p) = _{a ∈ L | f ∗(a) ≤ p} .

In this way we have a functor

Σ : Loc → Top ,

which is right adjoint to Ω. If X is a topological space there is a continuous map sobX : X → Σ Ω(X),
called the soberiﬁcation of X, which to each x ∈ X assigns the complement in X of the closure {x}.
The space X is T0 if and only if sobX is injective. Moreover, note the following simple fact:

Lemma 4.3 If sobX is surjective then it is an open map.

Proof.
surjective we have sobX (W ) = UW .

Let W ⊂ X be open. The condition sobX(x) ∈ UW is equivalent to x ∈ W , so if sobX is

It follows that if sobX is bijective then it is necessarily a homeomorphism, and in this case X is said
to be a sober space. In particular, the spectrum of a locale is a sober space, and hence T0.

The adjunction between Ω and Σ restricts to an equivalence of categories between the full subcat-
egories of spatial locales and sober spaces. If X is a Hausdorﬀ space, the prime elements of Ω(X) are
exactly the open sets of the form X \ {x} and thus X is sober.

5 Quotient vector bundles via locales

The ideas described in the introduction show that a quotient vector bundle A = (π : E → X, A, q) gives
rise to an adjunction between Sub A and Ω(X), both regarded as sup-lattices under the inclusion order.
The left adjoint is the open support map σ : Sub A → Ω(X), and the right adjoint γ : Ω(X) → Sub A
yields, for each open set U ⊂ X, the set of “formal sections” a ∈ A such that the open support
supp◦ ˆa is contained in U . In this section we pursue this idea in order to study quotient vector bundles,
in the end obtaining an adjunction between the category of such locales with linear structure and a
subcategory of the category of quotient vector bundles. The objects of this category will be called
spectral vector bundles. Any quotient vector bundle on a sober base space and with closed zero section
will be seen to be of this kind.

5.1 Linearized locales

Basic deﬁnitions and facts. Let △ be a locale. By a linear structure on △ is meant a topological
vector space A together with a sup-lattice homomorphism

σ : Sub A → △ ,

which we refer to as the support map, and whose right adjoint γ : △ → Sub A restricts to a continuous
map k = γ|Σ(△) : Σ(△) → Sub A. The map γ is referred to as the restriction map — for each U ∈ △
we should think of γ(U ) as the restriction of A to U , where A is regarded as a space of formal global
sections on △. The restriction k is referred to as the kernel map of the linear structure.

By a linearized locale A = (△, A, σ, γ) will be meant a locale △ equipped with a linear structure

given by A and σ, with σ ⊣ γ.

The continuity of the kernel map of a linear structure has the following necessary condition:

Lemma 5.1 Let A = (△, A, σ, γ) be a linearized locale. For all p, q ∈ Σ(△) the following implication
holds:

p ≤ q ⇒ γ(p) = γ(q) .

Proof. The specialization order of the topology of Σ(△) is dual to the order of △. Hence, the kernel
map, which is monotone because γ is, is also antitone on prime elements due to continuity, and thus
the condition p ≤ q implies that γ(p) and γ(q) are topologically equivalent, which for the lower Vietoris
topology means precisely that their closures in A are the same.

We also mention, although we shall not use it in this paper, the following general necessary and

suﬃcient condition for the continuity of the kernel map.

Theorem 5.2 Let △ be a locale, A a topological vector space, and σ ⊣ γ an adjunction from Sub A to

△. Then k := γ|Σ(△) is continuous if and only if for all open sets U ⊂ A the set Ta∈U Uσ(hai) is closed

in Σ(△).

Proof.

Let U ⊂ A be an open set and p ∈ Σ(△). Then

p ∈ k−1( ˜U ) ⇐⇒ k(p) ∩ U 6= ∅
⇐⇒ ∃a∈U a ∈ k(p)
⇐⇒ ∃a∈U hai ⊂ γ(p)
⇐⇒ ∃a∈U σ(hai) ≤ p
⇐⇒ ∃a∈U p /∈ Uσ(hai)

Uσ(hai) ,

⇐⇒ p /∈ \

a∈U

and thus k−1( ˜U ) = Σ(△) \Ta∈U Uσ(hai). Hence, k is continuous if and only if Ta∈U Uσ(hai) is closed for

all U ∈ Ω(A).

Morphisms of linearized locales. Let the following be linearized locales:

A = (A, △A, σA, γA) ,
B = (B, △B, σB, γB) .

A morphism f : B → A is a pair (f , f ) consisting of a map of locales

and a continuous linear map

f : △B → △A

f : A → B

13

satisfying, for all V ∈ Sub A, the inclusion

(5.1)

σB(f (V )) ⊂ f ∗(σA(V )) .

In other words, f satisﬁes the following lax commutation relation:

(5.2)

Equivalently, on right adjoints, recalling that the right adjoint of Sub f coincides with f

, we have:

(5.3)

These morphisms yield an obvious category LinLoc, which we shall refer to as the category of
linearized locales (with lax morphisms). By requiring the above commutation relations to be strict we
obtain the subcategory sLinLoc, referred to as the strict category of linearized locales.

5.2 Spectral vector bundles

Main deﬁnitions and facts. Let A = (π : E → X, A, q) be a quotient vector bundle with kernel
map κ : X → Sub A, and consider the adjoint pair

where σ and γ are deﬁned by

Sub A

σ
⊥
γ

△

σ(V ) = [

a∈V

supp◦ ˆa ,

γ(U ) = {a ∈ A | supp◦ ˆa ⊂ U } .

This is not necessarily a linear structure on the locale Ω(X) because the map

k := γ|Σ(△) : Σ(△) → Sub A

is not necessarily continuous (cf. 6.16 below). We shall call k the spectral kernel map of the bundle A.
We say that A is a spectral (quotient) vector bundle if the following two conditions hold:

1. k is continuous;

2. κ = k ◦ sobX — if this condition holds we say that κ is sober, or that A has a sober kernel map,

or still, in view of 5.3 below, that A has the open support property.

The full category of QVBun (resp. sQVBun) whose objects are the spectral vector bundles is denoted
by QVBunΣ (resp. sQVBunΣ).

Lemma 5.3 For all x ∈ X we have κ(x) ⊂ k(cid:0)sob x(cid:1). Moreover, κ is sober if and only if for each

a ∈ A the set {x ∈ X | ˆa(x) = 0} is open. In particular, this is the case if the (image of the) zero
section of π is a closed set of E.

Proof. The ﬁrst inclusion holds because we have κ(x) = {a ∈ A | ˆa(x) = 0} and

k(sob x) = k(X \ {x}) = {a ∈ A | x /∈ supp◦ ˆa}

and also ˆa(x) = 0 ⇒ x /∈ supp◦ ˆa. And the equality κ = k ◦ sob holds if and only if for all a ∈ A we
have ˆa(x) = 0 ⇐⇒ x /∈ supp◦ ˆa. In particular, this equivalence holds if the zero section is closed in
E.

Lemma 5.4 If κ is sober and sob is surjective then A is spectral.

Proof. The surjectivity of sob tells us that the direct image sob! : Ω(X) → Ω Σ Ω(X) is surjective
(cf. 4.3). Therefore the inverse image map sob−1 is injective and sob! ◦ sob−1 is the identity map on
Ω Σ Ω(X). Hence,

k−1 = sob! ◦ sob−1 ◦k−1 = sob! ◦κ−1

and it follows that k is continuous.

Example 5.5 Any Banach bundle π : E → X as in [2] has a Hausdorﬀ base space X and a closed
zero section, and thus any quotient vector bundle (π, A, q) is spectral. For instance, if X is locally
compact we may take A = C0(π) and q = eval [8].

Example 5.6 It is possible to have a continuous spectral kernel and a sober base space without having
the open support property. An example of this is the universal quotient vector bundle with Hausdorﬀ
ﬁbers for a locally convex space A, whose base space Max A is sober — see 6.12 below.

Example 5.7 For examples with the open support property but discontinuous spectral kernel see 6.16
below, where it is also shown that for suitable A (in particular ﬁnite dimensional) we obtain spectral
vector bundles whose base spaces are sober and T1 (cf. 6.3), but not Hausdorﬀ (cf. 6.4).

The spectrum of a linearized locale. Let A = (△, A, σ, γ) be a linearized locale. We deﬁne its
spectrum to be the quotient vector bundle

which is classiﬁed by the continuous map

Σ(A) = k∗(U A)

k = γ|Σ(△) : Σ(△) → Sub A .

Lemma 5.8 For any linearized locale A, the spectrum Σ Ω(A) is a spectral vector bundle.

Proof.

Let us use the following notation:

Ω Σ(A) = (Ω Σ(△), A, σ, γ) .

The base space of Σ(A) is Σ(△), which is a sober space, so, by 5.3 and 5.4, we need only verify that
for each a ∈ A the set

{p ∈ Σ(△) | a /∈ γ(p)}

is open in Σ(△). This follows from the adjunction σ ⊣ γ, because for all p ∈ Σ(△) and a ∈ A we have

σ(hai) ≤ p ⇐⇒ hai ⊂ γ(p) ,

and thus {p ∈ Σ(△) | a /∈ γ(p)} is the open set Uσ(hai).

Theorem 5.9 The assignment A 7→ Σ(A) extends to a functor

Moreover, this functor restricts to the corresponding strict categories:

Σ : LinLoc → QVBunΣ .

Σ : sLinLoc → sQVBunΣ .

15

Proof.

Let A = (△, A, σ, γ) and A′ = (△′, A′, σ′, γ′) be linearized locales, and let

be a morphism in LinLoc. Deﬁning

f = (f , f ) : A′ → A

|Σ(△′) : Σ(△′) → Σ(△)

f♭ = f
f ∗ = f : A → A′

∗

we obtain a morphism f : Σ(A′) → Σ(A) in QVBun. In order to see this we only need to prove that
(3.5) holds. Let a ∈ A and y ∈ Σ(△′), and denote by k and k′ the restrictions of γ and γ′, respectively,
to Σ(△) and Σ(△′). Denote also the quotient vector bundles as follows:

Σ(A) = (π : E → Σ(△), A, q)
Σ(A′) = (π′ : E′ → Σ(△′), A′, q′)

Then, for all a ∈ A and y ∈ Σ(△′), we have

q(a, f♭(y)) = 0 ⇐⇒ a ∈ k(f♭(y))
(y)

∗
◦ γ′(y)

⇐⇒ a ∈ γ ◦ f
−1

=⇒ a ∈ f
⇐⇒ f (a) ∈ k′(y)
⇐⇒ q′(f ∗(a), y) = 0 .

Hence, (3.5) holds. It is also clear that if f is a strict morphism then the above implication is another
equivalence, and thus f is also strict. The functoriality is evident, so we have obtained two functors
as intended.

5.3 Adjunctions and equivalences

A left adjoint to the spectrum functor. For each spectral vector bundle

let

be the corresponding linearized locale.

A = (π : E → X, A, q) ,

Ω(A) = (Ω(X), A, σ, γ)

Lemma 5.10 Let A = (π : E → X, A, q) be a spectral vector bundle with kernel map κ, and let

with kernel map k. Then

is a morphism in sQVBunΣ.

Σ Ω(A) = (p : E → Σ Ω(X), A, q) ,

sobA := (sobX, idA) : A → Σ Ω(A)

Proof. The condition for being a strict morphism is given by (3.7), so for all a ∈ A and x ∈ X we
must prove the equivalence

q(a, sobX (x)) = 0 ⇐⇒ q(a, x) = 0 ,

which is immediate because k(sobX(x)) = κ(x):

q(a, sobX(x)) = 0 ⇐⇒ a ∈ k(sobX(x)) ⇐⇒ a ∈ κ(x) ⇐⇒ q(a, x) = 0 .

Hence, since both A and Σ Ω(A) are spectral (cf. 5.8), sobA is indeed a morphism in sQVBunΣ.

16

Remark. Note that for sobA to be a morphism at all it is necessary that it be strict, for the weaker
condition (3.5) in this case reads

q(a, sobX(x)) = 0 =⇒ q(a, x) = 0 ,

which implies

k ◦ sobX ≤ κ

and, by 5.3, is equivalent to strictness. Hence, for any quotient vector bundle A with continuous k, the
following conditions are equivalent:

1. A is spectral;

2. sobA is a morphism;

3. sobA is a strict morphism.

Theorem 5.11 The assignment A 7→ Ω(A) extends to a functor

Ω : QVBunΣ → LinLoc ,

which is left adjoint to Σ. Moreover the unit of the adjunction is the family {sobA}A, and the adjunction
restricts to the strict subcategories sQVBunΣ and sLinLoc.

In order to prove the theorem we shall show, for an arbitrary spectral vector bundle A, that
Proof.
(Ω(A), sobA) is a universal arrow from A to Σ. So let the following be, respectively, a spectral vector
bundle and a linearized locale,

A = (π : E → X, A, q) ,
B = (△, B, σB, γB) ,

and let f = (f♭, f ∗) : A → Σ(B) be a morphism in QVBunΣ (cf. 5.8). We need to prove that there is
a unique morphism of linearized locales

such that the following diagram commutes:

f = (f , f ) : Ω(A) → B

Σ Ω(A)

Σ(f)

Σ(B)

Let us use the following notations for the structure maps of Ω(A) and Σ(B):

Ω(A) = (Ω(X), A, σA, γA) ,
Σ(B) = (π′ : E′ → Σ(△), B, q′) .

Due to the adjunction Ω ⊢ Σ between Top and Loc there is in Loc a unique map f : Ω(X) → △ such
that Σ(f ) ◦ sobX = f♭ — its inverse image is deﬁned, for all d ∈ △, by

(5.4)

f ∗(d) = f −1

♭

(Ud) ,

where Ud = {p ∈ Σ(△) | d (cid:2) p}. In addition, f must obviously be f ∗, so we must now verify that (5.1)
holds for f. With the necessary notation changes this condition is, for all V ∈ Sub B,

(5.5)

σA(f ∗(V )) ⊂ f ∗(σB(V )) ,

or, using (5.4),

(5.6)

σA(f ∗(V )) ⊂ f −1

(UσB (V )) .

In order to prove the latter condition we shall prove that, for all x ∈ X, if x /∈ f −1
x /∈ σA(f ∗(V )). Let then x /∈ f −1
equivalent to σB(V ) ≤ f♭(x), and, by adjointness, to

(UσB (V )) then
(UσB (V )). This is equivalent to f♭(x) /∈ UσB (V ), which in turn is

♭

♭

(5.7)

V ⊂ γB(f♭(x)) .

Now f♭(x) ∈ Σ(△) and thus, by deﬁnition, γB(f♭(x)) = κ′(f♭(x)), where κ′ is the kernel map of Σ(B).
Hence, (5.7) is equivalent to the statement that every a ∈ V satisﬁes a ∈ κ′(f♭(x)), which in turn is
equivalent to

(5.8)

∀a∈V q′(a, f♭(x)) = 0 .

Since f is a morphism of quotient vector bundles the latter implies

(5.9)

which is equivalent to

(5.10)

∀a∈V q(f ∗(a), x) = 0 ,

f ∗(V ) ⊂ κ(x) .

Since A is spectral we have κ = k ◦ sobX , and thus (5.10) is equivalent to

f ∗(V ) ⊂ k(sobX (x)) = γA(sobX(x)) ,

and, by adjointness, equivalent to

σA(f ∗(V )) ⊂ sobX(x) = X \ {x} ,

which, since σA(f ∗(V )) is open in X, is equivalent to

(5.11)

x /∈ σA(f ∗(V )) .

This concludes the proof of the inclusion (5.6), and establishes the adjunction Ω ⊢ Σ. Now we note
that all but one of the steps in the above proof of (5.5) are equivalences. But if f is a strict morphism
the implication (5.8)⇒(5.9) becomes an equivalence, too, and we obtain

σA(f ∗(V )) = f ∗(σB(V )) ,

which means that f is strict. Together with the fact that sobA is strict, this proves that the adjunction
restricts to the strict subcategories.

Sober vector bundles. Let A = (π : E → X, A, q) be a quotient vector bundle with kernel map
κ : X → Sub A. We say that A is a sober vector bundle if the two following conditions hold:

• X is a sober space;

• κ is sober.

By 5.3 and 5.4 we immediately obtain:

Corollary 5.12 The following conditions satisfy (1) ⇒ (2) ⇒ (3):

1. X is sober and the zero-section of A is closed in E;

2. A is sober;

18

3. A is spectral.

Example 5.13 Any Banach bundle on a locally compact Hausdorﬀ space can be made a sober vector
bundle (cf. 5.5). Examples of quotient vector bundles that are spectral but not sober can of course
be obtained from any sober vector bundle (π : E → X, A, q) by pulling it back along a quotient map
Y → X such that Y is not sober.

Theorem 5.14 Let A = (△, A, σ, γ) and A = (π, A, q) be a linearized locale and a quotient vector
bundle, respectively.

1. The spectrum Σ(A) is a sober vector bundle.

2. The bundle A is sober if and only if

is an isomorphism.

sobA = (sobX, idA) : A → Σ Ω(A)

Proof. We have already seen in 5.8 that Σ(A) is spectral, so it is sober because Σ(△) is. This proves
(1), and (2) is obvious.

Spatial linearized locales. Let A = (△, A, σ, γ) be a linearized locale. The spatialization of A is
the pair

spatA = (spat△ : Ω Σ(△) → △, idA : A → A) .

Theorem 5.15 spatA is a strict morphism of linearized locales Ω Σ(A) → A.

Proof.

Let Ω Σ(A) = (Ω Σ(△), A, ˜σ, ˜γ). Then spatA is a strict morphism if and only if the following

to another adjunction, between the full subcategories of sober vector bundles and spatial linearized
locales, whose unit and co-unit are isomorphisms. Hence, we are provided with a linearized version of
the equivalence of categories between sober spaces and spatial locales:

Corollary 5.16 The adjunction Ω ⊣ Σ restricts to an equivalence between the full subcategories of
QVBunΣ and LinLoc whose objects are, respectively, the sober vector bundles and the spatial linearized
locales. This further restricts to an equivalence between the respective subcategories whose morphisms
are strict.

Max-valued linear structures. A quotient vector bundle (π, A, q) has Hausdorﬀ ﬁbers if and only
if its kernel map is valued in Max A. All our previous results carry through to this setting, and we
brieﬂy examine this.

First, we notice that Max A is both a topological retract of Sub A (under the lower Vietoris topology)

Conversely, given an adjunction

such that k := γ|Σ(△) : Σ(△) → Max A is continuous, composing this with the adjunction of (5.12) we
obtain a linearized locale (△, A, (−) ◦ σ, ι ◦ γ), whose kernel map is ι ◦ k.

Let us refer to such a linearized locale as a Max-linearized locale. All our results in section 5
remain true if restricted to Max-linearized locales and spectral vector bundles with Hausdorﬀ ﬁbers.
In addition we note that, by 5.1, if (△, A, σ, γ) is a Max-linearized locale then for all p, q ∈ Σ(△) we
have the following implication:

(5.14)

p ≤ q ⇒ γ(p) = γ(q) .

Spectral vector bundles revisited. We begin with the following simple consequence of 5.1 and
(5.14):

Lemma 5.17 Let A = (π, A, q) be a spectral vector bundle with kernel map κ and spectral kernel map
k. For all x, y ∈ X we have the following implication, where ⊑ denotes the specialization preorder of
the topology of X:

x ⊑ y ⇒ κ(x) = κ(y) .

Moreover, if A has Hausdorﬀ ﬁbers we have

x ⊑ y ⇒ κ(x) = κ(y) .

Proof.
sob(y) ≤ sob(x), and thus by 5.1 we obtain

Let x, y ∈ X be such that x ⊑ y. Then sob(x) ⊑ sob(y) in Σ(△), which is equivalent to

κ(x) = γ(sob(x)) = γ(sob(y)) = κ(y) .

The case of Hausdorﬀ ﬁbers is similarly obtained from (5.14).

Less obvious is that 5.1 has a converse:

Theorem 5.18 Let A = (π : E → X, A, q) be a quotient vector bundle with kernel map κ satisfying
the condition κ = k ◦ sob, where k : Σ Ω(X) → Sub A is deﬁned in the usual way for all P ∈ Σ Ω(X):

k(P ) = {a ∈ A | supp◦ ˆa ⊂ P } .

have the implication

Proof.
shall show that for any open set W ⊂ Sub A we have

It remains to be proved only that (5.15) implies the continuity of k. In order to prove this we

(5.16)

k−1(W ) = Uκ−1(W ) .

Let P ∈ Uκ−1(W ). Then κ−1(W ) 6⊂ P , so there is x ∈ X such that x ∈ κ−1(W ) and x /∈ P . But then
κ(x) ∈ W and

x /∈ P ⇐⇒ P ⊂ sob(x) =⇒ k(P ) ≡ k(cid:0)sob(x)(cid:1) = κ(x) ,

where ≡ denotes topological equivalence. Since κ(x) ∈ W and k(P ) ≡ κ(x) we have k(P ) ∈ W , and
thus P ∈ k−1(W ).

Reciprocally, assume P ∈ k−1(W ), that is, k(P ) ∈ W . Then for any x /∈ P we have P ⊂ sob(x), so

κ(x) = k(cid:0)sob(x)(cid:1) ≡ k(P ) ,

and hence κ(x) ∈ W . This shows that X \P ⊂ κ−1(W ). But then, since P 6= X, we have κ−1(W ) 6⊂ P ,
so P ∈ Uκ−1(W ), and this proves (5.16).

Corollary 5.19 Spectral vector bundles with Hausdorﬀ ﬁbers and injective kernel maps must have T1
base spaces.

Corollary 5.20 If a quotient vector bundle whose base space has a T1 soberiﬁcation satisﬁes the con-
dition κ = k ◦ sob then it is a spectral vector bundle.

6 Classifying spaces and universal bundles

In this section we deﬁne the open support topology on the spectrum Sub A of an arbitrary topological
vector space A. This topology is ﬁner than the lower Vietoris topology (for instance Max A becomes
a T1 space) but in general coarser than the Fell topology. We write Sub◦ A for Sub A with the open
support topology. This space classiﬁes the spectral vector bundles, at least those over base spaces X
such that sobX is surjective (e.g., Hausdorﬀ spaces). We also show that this classiﬁcation does not
necessarily apply to more general spaces X because although the quotient vector bundles classiﬁed by
continuous maps κ : X → Sub A have the open support property, their spectral kernels may fail to be
continuous. In particular, in general there is no universal spectral vector bundle for a given topological
vector space A. Conversely, we prove, for any locally convex space A, that the quotient vector bundle
determined by the inclusion Max A → Sub A (with the lower Vietoris topology) does not have the
open support property but that its spectral kernel is continuous (in fact constant). Along the way we
obtain general results concerning the prime open sets of topologies on Sub A that are ﬁner than the
lower Vietoris topology, in particular concluding that for locally convex spaces A the space Max A is
sober.

6.1 Classifying spaces for spectral vector bundles

Open support topology. Let A be a topological vector space. For each a ∈ A let

ˇa = {P ∈ Sub A | a /∈ P } .

The coarsest topology on Sub A that contains the lower Vietoris topology and makes all the sets ˇa
open will be referred to as the open support topology. The terminology is motivated by the following
lemma:

Lemma 6.1 Let A be a quotient vector bundle. Then A has the open support property if and only if
its kernel map is continuous with respect to the open support topology.

Let κ be the kernel map of A. Continuity of κ with respect to the open support topology is,
Proof.
since κ is continuous with respect to the lower Vietoris topology (because it is a kernel map), just the
statement that for all a ∈ A the set κ−1(ˇa) is open. But, by 5.3, this is equivalent to the open support
property because κ−1(ˇa) = {x ∈ X | a /∈ κ(x)}.

We shall denote by Sub◦ A and Max◦ A the spaces Sub A and Max A equipped with the open

support topology.

Corollary 6.2 Let X be a topological space whose soberiﬁcation map sob : X → Σ Ω(X) is surjective.
Then the spectral vector bundles (π, A, q) are, up to isomorphism, in bijective correspondence with the
continuous maps κ : X → Sub◦ A. This applies in particular to all sober spaces X, and thus also to
Hausdorﬀ spaces.

We note the following property, which will be used later on:

Lemma 6.3 Max◦ A is a T1 space.

Let V, W ∈ Max◦ A be distinct elements. Without loss of generality assume that V 6⊂ W ,
Proof.
and let a ∈ V \ W . Then we have both W ∈ ˇa and V /∈ ˇa, on one hand, and, on the other, W /∈ ^A \ W
and V ∈ ^A \ W .

Note, however, that Max◦ A is never a Hausdorﬀ space if dim A ≥ 2. The following example

illustrates this:

Example 6.4 Each open set of Max◦ C2 is an open set of the lower Vietoris topology minus a ﬁnite
number of rays. This implies that {(0, 0)} and h(z, w)i cannot be separated by disjoint neighborhoods
if (z, w) 6= (0, 0), since any basic open neighborhood of h(z, w)i is generated by an open set of the
Grassmannian Gr(1, C2) (see [8, Th. 7.5]).

Fell topology. The open support topology is deﬁned in a similar way to the Fell topology [1] (see
also [6, 8]), but the latter has subbasic open sets

ˇK = {V ∈ Max A | V ∩ K = ∅}

for each compact subset K ⊂ A instead of only ˇa = ˇ{a} for a ∈ A. Therefore the Fell topology is
obviously ﬁner than the open support topology. Next we show that under mild restrictions it is strictly
ﬁner.

Lemma 6.5 Let A be a ﬁrst countable topological vector space such that dim A > 2. Then there is a
compact set K ⊂ A which is not contained in any ﬁnite union of 2-dimensional subspaces.

Let e0 ∈ A and let {Un} be a countable basis of neighborhoods of e0 with Un+1 ⊂ Un for all
Proof.
n. There is a sequence (en) in A such that en ∈ Un for all n, with the property that for any i < j < k
the vectors ei, ej, ek are linearly independent: assume we have chosen e1, . . . , en−1 such that the list

e0, . . . , en−1 has this property, and let C = Si,j<n hei, ej i; since A \ C is open and dense, we can choose

en ∈ Un ∩ (A \ C), and the list e0, . . . , en has the required property. Now let K = {en}n≥0. The set K
is compact and no 2-dimensional subspace contains more than two elements of K.

Theorem 6.6 Let A be a ﬁrst countable topological vector space such that dim A > 2. Then the open
support topology is strictly coarser than the Fell topology.

Let K ⊂ A be a compact set which is not contained in any ﬁnite union of 2-dimensional
Proof.
subspaces (cf. 6.5). The set ˇK = {V ∈ Max A | V ∩ K = ∅} is open in the Fell topology. Let a ∈ A be
such that hai ∈ ˇK. We will show that no neighborhood of hai in the open support topology is contained
in ˇK. Any basic neighborhood of hai in the open support topology is of the form U ∩ ˇc1 ∩ · · · ∩ ˇcn
with U ⊂ Max A open in the lower Vietoris topology and c1, . . . , cn /∈ hai. But then ha, bi ∈ U for any
b ∈ A. Let C = Si ha, cii and choose b ∈ K \ C. Then for any i we have b /∈ ha, cii, so ci /∈ ha, bi
because ci /∈ hai. It follows that ha, bi ∈ U ∩ ˇc1 ∩ · · · ∩ ˇcn. But ha, bi /∈ ˇK, so ˇK is not open in the open
support topology.

6.2 Grassmannians

The Grassmannian of a Hausdorﬀ vector space. Let A be a Hausdorﬀ vector space. Recall
[8] that the k-Grassmannian of A is the set Gr(k, A) of k-dimensional linear subspaces of A, carrying
the quotient topology given by the identiﬁcation Gr(k, A) ∼= V (k, A)/ GL(k, C), where V (k, A) is
the space of injective linear maps from Ck to A with the product topology. Hence, the surjection
V (k, A) → Gr(k, A) that is deﬁned by φ 7→ Im φ is a continuous open map.

We have Gr(k, A) ⊂ Max A because ﬁnite dimensional subspaces of a Hausdorﬀ vector space are
closed, and in [8, Th. 7.2] it is shown that Gr(k, A) is a topological subspace of Max A with the lower
Vietoris topology. In addition, below we shall use the fact [8, Th. 7.5] that a basis of the lower Vietoris
topology of Max A consists of all the sets of the form

where C is an open set of a Grassmannian Gr(k, A) for some k ∈ N>0.

↑C := {V ∈ Max A | ∃W ∈C W ⊂ V } ,

Spaces of linear maps. Write L(k, A) for the space of all the linear maps from Ck to A with the
product topology. We note that we have a homeomorphism L(k, A) ∼= Ak, under which V (k, A) can
be identiﬁed with the subspace of linearly independent k-tuples.

Lemma 6.7 Let A be a topological vector space. Any proper linear subspace V ⊂ A has empty interior.

Let V ⊂ A be a proper linear subspace. For any U ⊂ V let v ∈ U and w /∈ V , and let
Proof.
f : C → A be the map deﬁned by f (λ) = v + λw. Then f −1(U ) = {0}, showing that U cannot be
open.

Lemma 6.8 Let A be a Hausdorﬀ vector space. If dim A ≥ k then V (k, A) is dense and open in
L(k, A).

Proof. We identify L(k, A) with Ak. Let us prove density. Let U = U1 × · · · × Uk ⊂ Ak with
each Ui open in A, and let a = (a1, . . . , ak) ∈ U be such that d = dim ha1, . . . , aki is maximal.
Assume that d < k. Then ha1, . . . , aki is a proper subspace of A, hence by 6.7 with empty interior.
Without loss of generality, assuming that ak ∈ ha1, . . . , ak−1i, we can choose a′
k ∈ Uk such that
dim ha1, . . . , ak−1, a′
ki > d, a contradiction. Hence, d = k. This proves that V (k, A) intersects U ,
and thus it is dense in L(k, A). Now let a = (a1, . . . , ak) ∈ V (k, A) be a linearly independent k-
It has been shown in [8, Lem. 7.1] that there are neighborhoods Ui of ai such that every
tuple.
(a′
k) ∈ U1 × . . . × Uk is linearly independent. Such an open set U1 × · · · × Uk is a neighborhood
of a contained in V (k, A), and thus V (k, A) is open in L(k, A).

Independent linear subspaces. We say that three linear subspaces V1, V2, V3 ⊂ A are independent
if for all permutations p of {1, 2, 3} we have Vp(1) ∩ (Vp(2) + Vp(3)) = {0}. Equivalently, the mapping
(a, b, c) 7→ a + b + c deﬁnes an isomorphism V1 ⊕ V2 ⊕ V3 ∼= V1 + V2 + V3.

Lemma 6.9 Let A be a Hausdorﬀ vector space, V ∈ Max A, and k1, k2 ∈ N>0.

1. If codim V ≥ k1+k2 then the subspace of pairs (W1, W2) such that V , W1 and W2 are independent

is open in Gr(k1, A) × Gr(k2, A).

2. Let a /∈ V . If codim V ≥ k1 + k2 + 1 then the subset

Wa = {(W1, W2) | a /∈ V + W1 + W2

and V, W1, W2 are independent}

is open and dense in Gr(k1, A) × Gr(k2, A).

3. Let a = (a1, . . . , am) ∈ (A \ V )m. If codim V ≥ k1 + k2 + 1 then the subset

Wa = {(W1, W2) | a1, . . . , am /∈ V + W1 + W2

and V, W1, W2 are independent}

is open and dense in Gr(k1, A) × Gr(k2, A).

4. Let a = (a1, . . . , am) ∈ (A \ V )m. If codim V ≥ k1 + k2 + 1 then the subset

Xa = {(W1, W2) | a1, . . . , am /∈ V + W1 + W2}

is dense in Gr(k1, A) × Gr(k2, A).

Let k = k1 + k2. The quotient space A/V is Hausdorﬀ because V is closed, and, since we have
Proof.
dim A/V ≥ k, by 6.8 we conclude that V (k, A/V ) is open in L(k, A/V ). Hence, ψ−1(V (k, A/V )) is
open in L(k1, A) × L(k2, A), where ψ is given by the following composition:

ψ

L(k1, A) × L(k2, A)

/ L(k, A)

∼=

((−)+V )∗

/ L(k, A/V )

[Under the identiﬁcation provided by the isomorphism L(k, A) ∼= Ak, the map ψ is the k-fold quo-
tient map Ak → (A/V )k.] Moreover, in fact we have ψ−1(V (k, A/V )) ⊂ V (k1, A) × V (k2, A), and
furthermore ψ−1(V (k, A/V )) is the subspace of pairs (φ1, φ2) such that the spaces V , Im φ1 and
Im φ2 are independent. Hence, since the quotient map V (ki, A) → Gr(ki, A) is open, the subspace
of pairs (W1, W2) ∈ Gr(k1, A) × Gr(k2, A) such that V , W1 and W2 are independent is open in
Gr(k1, A) × Gr(k2, A). This proves (1).

In order to prove (2), assume a /∈ V and codim V ≥ k + 1, and let Va = V ⊕ hai. Then
dim A/Va ≥ k and, again by 6.8, V (k, A/Va) is dense in L(k, A/Va). Since ψ is open and surjec-

tive, ψ−1(cid:0)V (k, A/Va)(cid:1) ⊂ V (k1, A) × V (k2, A) is also dense. Now ψ−1(cid:0)V (k, A/Va)(cid:1) is the subspace of

pairs (φ1, φ2) ∈ V (k1, A) × V (k2, A) such that the spaces Va, Im φ1 and Im φ2 are independent. Such
pairs are precisely the elements of the subspace

{(φ1, φ2) | a /∈ V + Im φ1 + Im φ2

and V, Im φ1, Im φ2 are independent} ,

which therefore is open and dense in V (k1, A) × V (k2, A). Hence, applying the quotient φi 7→ Im φi
we conclude that Wa is dense in Gr(k1, A) × Gr(k2, A), thus proving (2).

Now let us prove (3). For each i we have ai /∈ V , by (2) the set Wai

is open and dense in

Gr(k1, A) × Gr(k2, A), and thus so is the ﬁnite intersection Wa = Wa1 ∩ . . . ∩ Wam.

Finally, (4) follows from (3) because Wa ⊂ Xa.

6.3 Finer spectrum topologies

Lower Vietoris topology revisited.

In general it is not true, given some topological vector space

A, that ^U1 ∩ U2 = eU1 ∩ eU2 for arbitrary open sets U1, U2 ⊂ A. The following lemma provides an

example where this equality holds, involving convex open sets.

Lemma 6.10 Let A be a topological vector space, let U ⊂ A be a convex open set, and let a ∈ A. Let

U + = [

(U + λa) and U − = [

(U − λa) .

λ≥0

λ≥0

c− ∈ V ∩ U −. Then there are b−, b+ ∈ U and λ−, λ+ ≥ 0 such that c− = b− − λ−a and c+ = b+ + λ+a.

Then eU + ∩ eU − = eU .
Proof. We have U + ∩ U − = U so eU ⊂ eU + ∩ eU −. Let V ∈ eU + ∩ eU − and pick c+ ∈ V ∩ U + and
If λ+ = 0 then c+ = b+ ∈ V ∩ U and thus V ∈ eU . If λ+ 6= 0 let µ = λ−/(λ+ + λ−) ∈ [0, 1]. Then
µc+ + (1 − µ)c− = µb+ + (1 − µ)b− ∈ V ∩ U since both U and V are convex, so V ∈ eU .

Finer topologies and their prime open sets. Given V1, V2 ∈ Max A with V1 ⊂ V2, we introduce
the following notation:

UV1,V2 = Max A \(cid:8)V ∈ Max A | V1 ⊂ V ⊂ V2(cid:9) .

Given a collection S of subsets of Max A we shall write MaxS A for Max A equipped with the topology
which is generated by the lower Vietoris topology and by S. We state the following lemma in more
generality than needed in the rest of this paper.

Lemma 6.11 Let A be a locally convex space, let S be a collection of subsets of Max A, and let
Y ⊂ MaxS A be a subspace. Then for every prime open set P in Y there is V ∈ Max A such that for
some union S of elements of S we have

P = (cid:0)U0,V ∪ S(cid:1) ∩ Y .

Proof.

Let P ∈ Σ Ω(Y). Since every prime open set is the union of subbasic open sets (cf. 4.2)

and for all families (Uα) of open sets of A we have ^(cid:0)Sα Uα(cid:1) = Sα eUα, there is U ∈ Ω(A) such that
P = (eU ∪ S) ∩ Y, where S is a union of elements of S. Let Umax be the union of all the open sets
Uα ∈ Ω(A) such that (eUα ∪ S) ∩ Y = P. Then

(cid:0)eUmax ∪ S(cid:1) ∩ Y = [

α

(cid:0)eUα ∪ S(cid:1) ∩ Y = P .

Let V = A \ Umax. To complete the proof we only need to show that V ∈ Max A, since then eUmax =
^A \ V = U0,V .

1. First we show that if λ ∈ C and a ∈ V then λa ∈ V . The case λ = 0 follows since 0 /∈ Umax, for

otherwise we would have eUmax = Max A and P = Y, which is a contradiction because P is prime.
So assume λ 6= 0. Then for any open set U ∈ ΩA we have fλU = eU and hence, by maximality,

λUmax = Umax. The result immediately follows.

2. Now we want to show that a, b ∈ V ⇒ a + b ∈ V . We will prove this by contradiction.

If
2 (a + b) ∈ Umax, so there is a convex open set N ⊂ A

a + b ∈ Umax then, by (1), we have 1
satisfying 1

2 (a + b) ∈ N ⊂ Umax. Let

Na = [

λ≥0

(cid:0)N + λ(a − b)(cid:1)

and Nb = [

(cid:0)N + λ(b − a)(cid:1) .

λ≥0

25

Then a ∈ Na and b ∈ Nb, and, by 6.10, we have

( eNa ∩ Y) ∩ ( eNb ∩ Y) = eN ∩ Y ⊂ eUmax ∩ Y ⊂ P .

Hence, since P is prime, we must have either eNa ∩ Y ⊂ P or eNb ∩ Y ⊂ P. Without loss of
generality assume that eNa ∩ Y ⊂ P. Then

(cid:0)( ^Na ∪ Umax) ∪ S(cid:1) ∩ Y = (cid:0) eNa ∪ eUmax ∪ S(cid:1) ∩ Y = ( eNa ∩ Y) ∪ P = P ,

and it follows that Na ⊂ Umax, and thus a ∈ Umax.

6.4 Universal bundles

Universal quotient vector bundles. We shall denote by U 1A the universal bundle with Hausdorﬀ
ﬁbers for A (which is classiﬁed by the inclusion Max A → Sub A). The following result shows that the
open support property may fail even for bundles with Hausdorﬀ ﬁbers.

Theorem 6.12 Let A be a locally convex space. The following conditions hold:

1. Max A is sober;

2. U 1A has continuous spectral kernel but it is not spectral because it does not satisfy the open

support property.

Let Y = Max A and let S = ∅. Then 6.11 tells us that any prime open set is of the form
Proof.
P = U0,V = sob(V ) with V ∈ Max A, and it follows that the soberiﬁcation map of Max A is surjective.
It is also injective because Max A is T0, and therefore Max A is sober. Now we claim that, for any
a ∈ A, we have supp◦ ˆa = ∅. Suppose we have V ∈ supp◦ ˆa. Then ˆa(V ) 6= 0, which is equivalent
to a /∈ V . Then, since open sets of Max A are upper closed we must also have V ⊕ hai ∈ supp◦ a,
which implies a /∈ V ⊕ hai, a contradiction. This proves the claim, and it immediately follows that the
universal bundle U 1A does not have the open support property. But its spectral kernel k is continuous
because it is constant, since for all P ∈ ΣΩ(Max A) we have k(P) = {a ∈ A | supp◦ ˆa ⊂ P} = A.

Prime open sets for the open support topology. Now we use the description of prime open sets
of 6.11 in order to obtain a full characterization of the prime open sets for the open support topology.

Lemma 6.13 Let A be a topological vector space. Let also V1, V2 ∈ Max A with V1 ⊂ V2, let C ⊂
Max A, and let a1, . . . , ak ∈ A. The following conditions are equivalent:

1. ↑C ∩ ˇa1 ∩ · · · ∩ ˇak 6⊂ UV1,V2;

2. There is W ∈ C such that W ⊂ V2 and a1, . . . , ak /∈ W + V1.

If ↑C ∩ ˇa1 ∩ · · · ∩ ˇak 6⊂ UV1,V2 then there is V ∈ Max A and W ∈ C such that W ⊂ V ,
Proof.
a1, . . . , ak /∈ V and V1 ⊂ V ⊂ V2. It follows that W ⊂ V2 and a1, . . . , ak /∈ W + V1. Conversely, if
there is W ∈ C such that W ⊂ V2 and a1, . . . , ak /∈ W + V1 then W + V1 ∈ ↑C ∩ ˇa1 ∩ · · · ∩ ˇak and
W + V1 /∈ UV1,V2.

Lemma 6.14 Let A be a Hausdorﬀ vector space, and let V1, V2 ∈ Max◦ A be such that V1 ⊂ V2 and
the codimension of V1 inside V2 is inﬁnite. Then UV1,V2 is a prime open set.

Let U1 and U2 be open sets of Max◦ A. We shall prove that UV1,V2 is prime by showing that

Proof.
if U1 6⊂ UV1,V2 and U2 6⊂ UV1,V2 then U1 ∩ U2 6⊂ UV1,V2. Assume then that

(6.1)

U1 6⊂ UV1,V2

and U2 6⊂ UV1,V2 .

26

We may also assume that U1 and U2 are basic open sets, so, again by [8, Th. 7.5], we can write them
in the form

U1 = ↑C1 ∩ ˇa1 ∩ · · · ∩ ˇak

and U2 = ↑C2 ∩ ˇb1 ∩ · · · ∩ ˇbn ,

where C1 ⊂ Gr(d1, A) and C2 ⊂ Gr(d2, A) are open sets of Grassmannians. Then (6.1) implies, by
6.13, that a1, . . . , ak, b1, . . . , bn /∈ V1. Since the codimension of V1 in V2 is inﬁnite, we can apply 6.9(4)
in order to conclude that the set

{(W1, W2) ∈ Gr(d1, V2) × Gr(d2, V2) | a1, . . . , ak, b1, . . . , bn /∈ V1 + W1 + W2}

is dense in Gr(d1, V2) × Gr(d2, V2) (notice that these are Grassmannians of V2 rather than A). Con-
dition (6.1) implies that both U1 ∩ Gr(d1, V2) and U2 ∩ Gr(d2, V2) are not empty, so due to density
there exist W1 ∈ U1 and W2 ∈ U2 such that W1 + W2 ⊂ V2 and a1, . . . , ak, b1, . . . , bn /∈ V1 + W1 + W2.
Finally, again by 6.13, we have

U1 ∩ U2 = ↑(C1 + C2) ∩ ˇa1 ∩ · · · ∩ ˇak ∩ ˇb1 ∩ · · · ∩ ˇbn 6⊂ UV1,V2 .

Theorem 6.15 Let A be a Hausdorﬀ locally convex space, and let P be a subset of Max◦ A. Then P
is a prime open set if and only if either P = sob(V ) for some V ∈ Max◦ A, or P = UV1,V2 for some
V1, V2 ∈ Max◦ A such that V1 ⊂ V2 and the codimension of V1 inside V2 is inﬁnite.

Proof. Applying 6.11 with S = {ˇa}a∈A and Y = MaxS A = Max◦ A, we see that P = U0,V2 ∪ S with
V2 ∈ Max◦ A and S a union of elements of S. Then there is a subset C ⊂ A such that S = Sa∈C ˇa =

UV1,A, where V1 = hCi. Then P = U0,V2 ∪ UV1,A, and, since P 6= Y because P is prime, we must have
V1 ⊂ V2, and thus P = UV1,V2. If V1 = V2 then P = Y \ {V1}, and this equals sob(V1) because, by 6.3,
Max◦ A is T1. So let us assume V1 6= V2. Suppose that the codimension d of V1 inside V2 is ﬁnite. If
d = 1 then UV1,V2 = Y \ {V1, V2}, which is not prime. So let us assume that d ≥ 2. Write d = d1 + d2
with d1, d2 > 0, and pick open sets C1 ⊂ Gr(d1, A) and C2 ⊂ Gr(d2, A) with the following properties
(cf. 6.9):

1. There are W1 ∈ C1 and W2 ∈ C2 such that W1 + W2 ⊂ V2;

2. For any W1 ∈ C1 and W2 ∈ C2 the subspaces W1, W2 and V1 are independent.

Fix W1 ∈ C1 and W2 ∈ C2 with W1 + W2 ⊂ V2 and pick a ∈ V2 so that a /∈ V1 + W1 and a /∈ V1 + W2.
Due to [8, Th. 7.5] the sets ↑C1 and ↑C2 are open in Max◦ A, and from 6.13 it follows that

(6.2)

↑C1 ∩ ˇa 6⊂ UV1,V2

and ↑C2 ∩ ˇa 6⊂ UV1,V2 .

Notice also that

(6.3)

(cid:0)↑C1 ∩ ˇa(cid:1) ∩(cid:0)↑C2 ∩ ˇa(cid:1) = ↑(C1 + C2) ∩ ˇa .

By independence, for any W ∈ C1 + C2 we have either W 6⊂ V2 or W + V1 = V2, and thus either W 6⊂ V2
or a ∈ W + V1. Therefore, by 6.13, we have ↑(C1 + C2) ∩ ˇa ⊂ UV1,V2, and, due to (6.2) and (6.3), we
see that UV1,V2 is not prime. Finally, if the codimension of V1 in V2 is inﬁnite then UV1,V2 is prime, by
6.14.

Universal bundles versus open support topology. Let A be a topological vector space. The
identity id : Sub◦ A → Sub◦ A is the kernel map of a quotient vector bundle over Sub◦ A that satisﬁes
the open support property. However, as we shall see now, this is not in general a spectral vector
bundle because the spectral kernel may fail to be continuous.
In addition we show that the open
support property does not in general entail having a closed zero section.

We shall denote by U ◦A the bundle which is classiﬁed by the inclusion Max◦ A → Sub◦ A.

Theorem 6.16 Let A be a Hausdorﬀ vector space.

1. If dim A = ∞ the open support property for U ◦A holds but its spectral kernel is not continuous.

2. If dim A < ∞ then U ◦A is sober (and thus spectral).

Let κ and k be the kernel map and the spectral kernel map of U ◦A (κ is the identity on
Proof.
Max A). Then κ = k ◦ sob. Assuming ﬁrst that dim A = ∞, from 6.14 it follows that ∅ = U0,A is
a prime open set of Max◦ A. Given any V ∈ Max◦ A we have k(sob(V )) = κ(V ) = V .
If k were
continuous then from 5.18 we would conclude, since ∅ ⊂ V for all V ∈ Max◦ A, that k(∅) = V for all
V ∈ Max◦ A, a contradiction. If A has ﬁnite dimension then it is Euclidean and, by 6.15, the only
prime open sets are of the form sob(V ) for V ∈ Max◦ A. This means that Max◦ A is sober, and, by
5.4, we conclude that k is continuous. Hence, for ﬁnite dimensional A the bundle U ◦A is sober.

In addition, we mention the following simple consequence of 6.6:

Corollary 6.17 Let A be a ﬁrst countable topological vector space such that dim A > 2. Then the zero
section of U ◦A is not closed.

Proof. By [8, Th. 5.7], the kernel of a quotient vector bundle with closed zero section must be Fell
continuous, so the result follows immediately from 6.6.
