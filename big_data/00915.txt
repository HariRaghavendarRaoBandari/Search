Abstract

First, for 3WRI with positive wave energy, we present a regularity theorem for n ≤ 2. Second,
for 3WRI with negative wave energy, we present a class of solution in general spatial dimension
that will blow up in ﬁnite time. Moreover, a complete classiﬁcation of spatial uniform solution
is given for this particular system.

Introduction

In this paper we study the 3-wave resonance interaction (3WRI) system,

∂τ A1 + c1 · ∇A1 = iγ1A2A3,
∂τ A2 + c2 · ∇A2 = iγ2A1A3,
∂τ A3 + c3 · ∇A3 = iγ3A1A2,

in Ω,

(1.1)




with periodic boundary condition, where Ω is a rectangle domain,

Ω = {x ∈ Rn| |xi| < ai, i = 1, · · · , n}

and all A′
is are are complex amplitude and periodic on Ω. γi = ±1, and ci’s are real non-zero
constant vectors. The derivation of (1.1) is rather standard in e.g. nonlinear optics and can be
found in e.g. Chap. 4 in [1] and [9].

In this paper we are interested in the qualitative property of solution to (1.1). Namely, we are
interested in determining if a solution possesses either ﬁnite blow up or global existence. Depending
on whether γi’s have the same sign, the system (1.1) can be classiﬁed into two cases, and each case
models diﬀerent physical phenomena.

γi’s not having the same sign corresponds to 3WRI with positive wave energy, which generates
from various physics background e.g. nonlinear optics and water waves.
In fact most study of
3WRI in the past focuses on this case, and an important tool is inverse scattering transformation
(IST), with which people construct exact solution for some special initial value, e.g. “separable”
initial value [7], or more general initial value [8]. A detailed review of the 1-D problem can be found
e.g. in [9]. The 3-D problem was treated by Cornille [3] and Kaup in a series of papers [7, 8]. See
also some recent developments in [4].

However, it seems there has not been any regularity analysis of 3WRI in the case of γi’s not
having the same sign. Here, we prove that for n ≤ 2 the system (1.1) cannot develop singularity
in ﬁnite time.
If γi’s do not have the same sign, then the constants of motion of system (1.1)
(see (2.1)) leads to L2 boundedness of the solution. Thus, by a scaling argument (or “blow-up”
procedure) we get

Theorem 1.1. For space dimension n ≤ 2, if initial data is continuously diﬀerentiable in space
and γi’s do not have the same sign, then the solution system (1.1) exists in inﬁnite time.

Remark 1.2.

(a) As far as we know, for higher dimension n ≥ 3, whether system (1.1) can
generate singularity in ﬁnite time is open. In the case of spatial uniform 3WRI, it is known
that the solution cannot blow up in ﬁnite time due to the Manley-Rowe relation (constants of
motion in spatial uniform case),

K1 =

|A1|2
γ1

−

|A2|2
γ2

, K2 =

|A1|2
γ1

−

|A3|2
γ3

.

Since γi’s do not have the same sign, it is easy to see |Ai|’s are bounded.

(b) The major tool of studying 3WRI so far has been inverse scattering transform (see e.g. Kaup
et al.
[9], Zakharov and Manakov [12]). One feature of this paper is that we use diﬀerent
analytical technique to provide some new points of view on the problem of 3WRI. To obtain
Theorem 1.1, we use the method of “blow-up” procedure. Such procedure was probably ﬁrst
introduced by De Giorgi in his study of minimal surfaces. Nowadays, the argument is com-
monly used in the study of potential singularity of various equations and systems, e.g. on
Navier-Stokes equation [10] and some elliptic systems [11].

(c) The proof of Theorem 1.1 is also valid for L2 solution of (1.1) on Rn, n = 1, 2. The optimal
choice of initial value such that guarantees solution to be regular is not the goal of this paper.

The case that γi’s have the same sign corresponds to 3WRI with negative wave energy. One
interesting phenomena about such 3WRI system is that the solution can blow up in ﬁnite time.
Coppi et al. [2] probably ﬁrst found such instability of 3WRI with negative wave energy in plasma
physics, which they called “explosively unstable”.

Heuristically, the transportation wave equation is non-dispersive, and the nonlinear term should
enhance the amplitude in a superlinear way. One can compare this to a diﬀerent system, the 3-
D wave equation, where the positive feedback from the nonlinear term needs to race with the
dispersive tendency (See a classic paper of F. John [5]). So, ﬁnite blow up should not be a surprise
in system (1.1) when γi’s have the same sign. However, note that complex amplitude means phase
interaction and ci’s are linearly independent, which both cause diﬃculty in analysis. This paper is
dedicated to determining if a solution will blow up in ﬁnite time given any initial value.

ci’s are assumed to be linearly independent in this case. If ci’s are linearly dependent, (1.1)
can be reduced to one spatial dimensional 3WRI. The 1D-3WRI was approached by Zakharov and
Manakov [12] (and independently by Kaup [6]) with inverse scattering transformation, though the
boundary condition they considered is that the solution decays suﬃciently fast as |x| → ∞.

Besides ﬁnite-in-time blow-up solution, system (3.1) obviously admits global-in-time existing
solution, e.g., two of Ai’s are zero and the third is a constant. A natural question is whether
(3.1) admits other non-trivial global existing solutions. In this paper, we show that the system
admits globally existing and decaying solution. Moreover, the spatial uniform solution of (3.1) is
completely classiﬁed,

Theorem 1.3. A necessary and suﬃcient condition of ﬁnite-in-time blow-up solution to (3.3) is
that the initial condition satisﬁes one of the following,

1. Only one of Ai(0)’s is zero, i.e., |A3(0)| ≥ |A1(0)| > |A2(0)| = 0;

2. (θ1 + θ2 + θ3)(0) = 3π

2 , one of Ai(0)’s is strictly less than the other two and none is zero, i.e.,

|A3(0)| ≥ |A1(0)| > |A2(0)| > 0;

2

3. (θ1 + θ2 + θ3)(0) 6= 3π

2 (implicitly none of Ai(0)’s is zero),

where the indexes {1, 2, 3} allow any permutation.

Remark 1.4. We think an interesting question is, whether all globally existing solution to (3.1) is
spatial uniform, and this is so far open.

We also describe a new class of solutions that blow up in ﬁnite time (Theorem 1.5),

Theorem 1.5. Suppose θi(x, 0) = θi(0) and (θ1 + θ2 + θ3)(0) = π
blows up in ﬁnite time.

2 , and then the solution of (3.1)

The mathematical technique used here is elementary, and the results are based on the method

of characteristics. We believe that a natural step after this is to implement perturbation theory.

This paper is organized this way. In section 2, we focus on 3WRI with positive wave energy
and prove Theorem 1.1. In section 3, we study 3WRI with negative wave energy. In section 3.1,
we focus on space-independent case and prove Theorem 1.3. In section 3.2, we consider the general
case, and after brieﬂy discussing the well-posedness of (1.1) we prove Theorem 1.5.

3WRI with positive wave energy

Consider system (1.1) with γ1 = 1, γ2, γ3 = −1. To outline the idea of the proof, we ﬁrst show a
well-known fact that the L2 norm is bounded. Then we assume there exists a singularity at time
t∗. Then we have a sequence of time approaching t∗ at which the maximum norm of the solution
approaches inﬁnity. After a rescaling, we get a sequence of bounded solution which converges to a
limit solution, and this leads to a contradiction.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. (1.1) admits two constants of motion,

const =ZΩ

|A1|2
γ1

−

|A2|2
γ2

dx,

const =ZΩ

|A1|2

γ3

(2.1)

where the index 1, 2, 3 above allow any permutation. So, if γi’s do not have the same sign, then
the spatial L2 norms of Ai’s are obviously always bounded.

Assume that a solution to (1.1) develops a singularity at (x∗, t∗). Then there exists a sequence

{(xk, tk)}∞

k such that tk ր t∗ and let

Mk = max
x∈Ω

(|A1(x, tk)| + |A2(x, tk)| + |A3(x, tk)|)

= |A1(xk, tk)| + |A2(xk, tk)| + |A3(xk, tk)|,

then Mk → +∞. Now, let

˜A(k)

i =

We see that ˜A(k)

3WRI with negative wave energy

Now, if γi’s have the same sign, after a simple scaling of Ai’s we can move γi’s out of (1.1) and get

with periodic boundary condition. The constants of motion are,

∂τ A1 + c1 · ∇A1 = iA2A3,
∂τ A2 + c2 · ∇A2 = iA1A3,
∂τ A3 + c3 · ∇A3 = iA1A2,



|A1|2 − |A2|2dx, K2 =ZΩ
K1 =ZΩ

in Ω,

|A1|2 − |A3|2dx,

(3.1)

(3.2)

where K1, K2 are constants.

3.1 Space uniform case

There are many classical studies (for reference, see section I. D. of [9]) of space-independent 3WRI
which is an ODE system. Here we give a complete classiﬁcation of space independent solutions of
the negative wave energy case of 3WRI,

The system (3.3) admits three constants of the motion:

∂τ A1 = iA2A3,
∂τ A2 = iA1A3,
∂τ A3 = iA1A2.




K1 = |A1|2 − |A2|2, K2 = |A1|2 − |A3|2,

H = A1A2A3 + A1A2A3,

(3.3)

(3.4)

where K1, K2 and H are constants. The ﬁrst two identities are also called Manley-Rowe relations.

By direct calculation we rewrite (3.3) as

∂τ r2

i = 2r1r2r3 sin(θ1 + θ2 + θ3), for i = 1, 2, 3,

r1∂τ θ1 = r2r3 cos(θ1 + θ2 + θ3),
r2∂τ θ2 = r1r3 cos(θ1 + θ2 + θ3),
r3∂τ θ3 = r1r2 cos(θ1 + θ2 + θ3),

and (3.4) becomes

K1 = r2

H = 2r1r2r3 cos(θ1 + θ2 + θ3).

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

Remark 3.1. (3.5)-(3.6) holds only when none of ri’s is zero. This is because θi is not deﬁned when
ri = 0. Actually, we should pay special attention to the situation when Ai’s touch zero since (3.3)
does not satisfy Lipchitz condition there. However, we can take advantage of (3.4). For instance A1
touches zero at τ = τ0 and A2(τ0), A3(τ0) 6= 0, then ∂τ Ai(τ0) 6= 0, i.e., |A1| will increase and hence
|A2|, |A3| will increase for K1, K2 are constant. By (3.5), we must have sin(θ1 + θ2 + θ3) > 0 and
this implies (θ1 + θ2 + θ3)(τ0+) ∈ (0, π). Moreover, we know H ≡ 0 and hence (θ1 + θ2 + θ3)(τ ) ≡ π
2
for τ ∈ (τ0, ∞). With a little extra eﬀort we can show that the solution must blow up in ﬁnite time.
If two of Ai’s, say A1, A2, are zero at τ = τ0, the solution of (3.3) has to be an equilibrium, see

the proof of Theorem 3.3.

Proposition 3.2. If (θ1 + θ2 + θ3)(0) 6= π

2 or 3π

2 , then none of Ai’s will touch zero.

Proof. Since H 6= 0, Ai 6= 0. (cid:3)

Theorem 3.3. A necessary and suﬃcient condition for the solution of (3.3) to exist global in time
is that, the initial data satisﬁes either of the following,

(i) |A3(0)| ≥ |A1(0)| = |A2(0)| = 0;

(ii) |A3(0)| ≥ |A1(0)| = |A2(0)| > 0 and (θ1 + θ2 + θ3)(0) = 3π
2 ;

where the indexes {1, 2, 3} allow any permutation.

Proof. We ﬁrst prove the suﬃciency.
For (ii) by (3.7) H, K1 ≡ 0 and K2 ≤ 0. So, r1 = r2.
Notice that our choice of initial value ensures that all ri, i = 1, 2, 3 decay until one of them
touches zero. Let’s deﬁne τ0 to be the ﬁrst time that one of ri’s touches zero. If τ0 = ∞ then we
have a global decaying solution. So, we assume τ0 < ∞ and to sum up:

1. ri, i = 1, 2, 3 decays in [0, τ0];

2. (θ1 + θ2 + θ3)(τ ) = 3π

2 in [0, τ0);

Let d0 := |A3(0)| − |A1(0)| ≥ 0. Case 1: If d0 = 0, we can solve the system (3.5) on interval [0, τ0)
by

ri =

ri(0)

1 + 2ri(0)τ

.

(3.8)

Thus ri(τ0) 6= 0, which contradicts with the assumption on r0. So, (3.8) can extend to [0, ∞).

Case 2: If d0 > 0, by (3.5) and the facts r1 = r2, r3(τ ) ≤ r3(0) on [0, τ0) we have

Hence by Gr¨onwall’s inequality,

∂τ r1 ≥ −r3(0)r1.

r1 = r2 ≥ r1(0)e−r3(0)τ .

(3.9)

Similar to case 1, ri(τ0) 6= 0 contradicts with the assumption on r0, so (3.9) can extend to [0, ∞).
For (i), the initial data obviously admits an equilibrium solution, and we claim that this is the
only solution (this is not obvious since we lose Lipchitz condition of (3.3) if some Ai’s are zero).
Suppose a non-constant solution A1(τ ), A2(τ ), A3(τ ) with initial condition |A3(0)| ≥ |A1(0)| =
|A2(0)| = 0 (so H ≡ 0) and |A3| ≥ |A1| = |A2| > 0 at τ = τ0 (since K1 ≡ 0, r1 ≡ r2). Then if we

5

change the time direction of (3.3) by letting τ = τ0 − η and Bi(η) = Ai(τ0 − η) (and corresponding
new ri and θi), i = 1, 2, 3, then we get a new system,

∂ηB1 = −iB2B3,
∂ηB2 = −iB1B3,
∂ηB3 = −iB1B2,

(3.10)




with initial value |B3(0)| ≥ |B2(0)| = |B1(0)| > 0 at η = 0. From H ≡ 0 (H, K1, K2 does not
change) and ri, i = 1, 2, 3, decaying for some interval, we see that θ1 + θ2 + θ3 = π
2 for that interval.
So, similar to the proof for (ii), it has a unique solution that decays to a limit (0, 0, A3(τ = 0))
as η → ∞ and never touches zero in ﬁnite time. This contradicts with (B1(τ0), B2(τ0), B3(τ0)) =
(A1(0), A2(0), A3(0)) = (0, 0, A3(0)).

Now we turn to the necessity. If the initial data does not satisfy either condition in Theorem

3.3, we have the following cases,

1. Only one of Ai(0)’s is zero, i.e., |A3(0)| ≥ |A1(0)| > |A2(0)| = 0;

2. (θ1 + θ2 + θ3)(0) = 3π

2 , one of Ai(0)’s is strictly less than the other two and none is zero, i.e.,

|A3(0)| ≥ |A1(0)| > |A2(0)| > 0;

3. (θ1 + θ2 + θ3)(0) 6= 3π

2 (implicitly none of Ai(0)’s is zero).

Again, the above indexes {1, 2, 3} allow any permutation. We are going to show that solutions to
the above initial conditions will blow up in ﬁnite time.

For case 1, by Remark 3.1, we know (θ1 + θ2 + θ3)(τ ) ≡ π

2 for τ ∈ (0, ∞), and by (3.5) and

(3.7) we have,

where K1, K2 < 0. Hence it is easy to see r1 blows up in ﬁnite time.

∂τ r2

For case 2, by (3.5) we know that A2 will touch zero ﬁrst in ﬁnite time, call this time as τ0.
2 for τ > τ0. This implies a

Then ∂τ A2(τ0) 6= 0 and by Remark 3.1 we know (θ1 + θ2 + θ3)(τ ) = π
ﬁnite-in-time blow up.

For case 3, let Θ = θ1 + θ2 + θ3. If Θ(0) ∈ (− π

1. we show that Θ increases and approaches π

) cos Θ.

By 3.7 we have |r1r2r3| ≥ |H|. Suppose ri > η1, i = 1, 2, 3 for some η1 > 0, then there exists some
constant η0 > 0 such that ( r2r3
) > η0. Now without loss of generality suppose r1 → 0,
r1
then r2r3 → ∞, hence r2r3
→ ∞. In both cases, we see that cos Θ is positive since Θ ∈ (− π

and hence Θ will approach π

where the second inequality is due to (3.7). So a ﬁnite blow up in r1 can be easily derived.

Similarly we have a ﬁnite blow up for Θ(0) ∈ ( π

3.2 General case

First we brieﬂy discuss the well-posedness of (1.1). The local existence and uniqueness is guaranteed
by method of characteristics. Also, the spatial periodic boundary condition is directly satisﬁed if
initial value is periodic, since all ci’s are constant vectors.

Now we consider (3.1), and by direct calculation we rewrite the system as

∂τ r2

i + ci · ∇r2

i = 2r1r2r3 sin(θ1 + θ2 + θ3), for i = 1, 2, 3,

r1(∂τ θ1 + c1 · ∇θ1) = r2r3 cos(θ1 + θ2 + θ3),
r2(∂τ θ2 + c2 · ∇θ2) = r1r3 cos(θ1 + θ2 + θ3),
r3(∂τ θ3 + c3 · ∇θ3) = r1r2 cos(θ1 + θ2 + θ3),

(3.11)

(3.12)

To outline the proof, if initially Ai is lined up in the same direction at each point, and the summation
of θi’s equal π
2 , then all θi’s preserve at all time. Hence (3.12) is moved out of the equations. Then
we are left to analyze (3.11).

Proof of Theorem 1.5. Step 1. We show that (θ1 + θ2 + θ3)(x, τ ) ≡ π
2 .
Note that implicitly, the initial condition guarantees that Ai(x, 0)’s are nowhere zero and
bounded. So, the short time existence and uniqueness of solution to (3.11) is provided by method
of characteristics. Hence, θi(x, τ ) ≡ θi(0) and (θ1 + θ2 + θ3)(x, τ ) ≡ π
2 .

Step 2. (3.11) becomes

∂τ r1 + c1 · ∇r1 = r2r3,
∂τ r2 + c2 · ∇r2 = r1r3,
∂τ r3 + c3 · ∇r3 = r1r2,

in Ω.




By method of characteristics, the corresponding characteristic equation for r1 is

( dr1

dτ = r2r3,
dx
dτ = c1,

(3.13)

with initial data x(0) = ξ and r1(ξ, 0) = φ1(ξ). Since r2, r3 ≥ 0, for ﬁxed ξ, r1(ξ, τ ) is monotone
increasing as τ increases. We say r1 is “monotone increasing” along characteristics. Similarly, r2, r3
are monotone increasing along their characteristics x = c2τ + ξ and x = c3τ + ξ.

Since ri(0)’s are strictly positive in Ω, the characteristic equations also imply that ri(x, τ ) > 0
on Ω for all τ > 0. This eliminates the possible zero at the boundary of Ω. Hence after any
τ = τ0 > 0, ri’s must have a positive inﬁmum in Ω. Suppose

f (τ ) = min
x∈Ω

{r1(x, τ ), r2(x, τ ), r3(x, τ )} ,

then f (τ ) > 0 for τ > τ0 > 0. We claim that f (τ ) is Lipschitz, and hence from (3.13) we see

hold in weak sense. This implies that f blows up in ﬁnite time, since for any positive v ∈ C 1
and if g is the solution of

where β(τ ) is non-negative (since f, g are positive) and suppose [τ0, T ] is the support of v. By
choosing suitable v we see that

w(T ) ≥ CZ T

τ0

β(s)w(s)ds,

where v(s) on the right is absolved in β(s). Hence by Gr¨onwall’s inequality w ≥ 0. Then g blowing
up in ﬁnite time implies that f blows up in ﬁnite time.

We ﬁnish the proof by proving the claim. Let ¯r1(τ ) = minx∈Ω r1(x, τ ) = r1(x∗, τ ),. Note that

r1 is monotone increasing along characteristics, then ¯r1(τ ) must be monotone increasing. Hence,

0 ≤

¯r1(τ + ∆τ ) − ¯r1(τ )

∆τ

≤

r1(x∗, τ + ∆τ ) − r1(x∗, τ )

∆τ

≤ |r1|C 1 .

So ¯r1(τ ) is Lipschitz. Similarly ¯r2, ¯r3 are Lipschitz. Finally, f = min{¯r1, ¯r2, ¯r3} is Lipschitz. (cid:3)

Remark 3.4. Although θi’s are constant, ri’s vary in space. So, for the future perturbation work,
one only needs to perturb θi’s.
