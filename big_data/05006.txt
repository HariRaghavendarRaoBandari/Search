ABSTRACT

2 O and H18

The apparition of bright comets C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) and C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) in March-April 2013 and January 2015, combined
with the improved observational capabilities of submillimeter facilities, oﬀered an opportunity to carry out sensitive compositional
and isotopic studies of the volatiles in their coma. We observed comet Lovejoy with the IRAM 30m telescope between 13 and 26
January 2015, and with the Odin submillimeter space observatory on 29 January - 3 February 2015. We detected 22 molecules and
several isotopologues. The H16
2 O production rates measured with Odin follow a periodic pattern with a period of 0.94 days
and an amplitude of ∼25%. The inferred isotope ratios in comet Lovejoy are 16O/18O=499 ± 24 and D/H =1.4 ± 0.4 × 10−4 in water,
32S/34S = 24.7 ± 3.5 in CS, all compatible with terrestrial values. The ratio 12C/13C = 109 ± 14 in HCN is marginally higher than
terrestrial and 14N/15N = 145 ± 12 in HCN is half the Earth ratio. Several upper limits for D/H or 12C/13C in other molecules are
reported. From our observation of HDO in comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy), we report the ﬁrst D/H ratio in an Oort Cloud comet that is
not larger than the terrestrial value. On the other hand, the observation of the same HDO line in the other Oort-cloud comet, C/2012 F6
(Lemmon), suggests a D/H value four times higher. Given the previous measurements of D/H in cometary water, this illustrates that
a diversity in the D/H ratio and in the chemical composition, is present even within the same dynamical group of comets, suggesting
that current dynamical groups contain comets formed at very diﬀerent places or times in the early solar system.

1. Introduction

Comets are the most pristine remnants of the formation of the
solar system 4.6 billion years ago. Investigating the composition
of cometary ices provides clues to the physical conditions and
chemical processes at play in the primitive solar nebula. Comets
may also have played a role in the delivery of water and organic

material to the early Earth (see Hartogh et al., 2011, and refer-
ences therein). The latest simulations of the early solar system
evolution (Brasser & Morbidelli , 2013; O’Brien et al., 2014),
suggest a more complex scenario. On the one hand, ice-rich bod-
ies formed beyond Jupiter may have been implanted in the outer
asteroid belt and participated in the supply of water to the Earth
or, on the other hand, current comets coming from either the Oort
Cloud or the scattered disk of the Kuiper belt may have formed
in the same trans-Neptunian region sampling the same diversity
of formation conditions. Understanding the diversity in compo-
sition and isotopic ratios of the comet material is thus essential
in order to assess such scenarios (Altwegg & Bockel´ee-Morvan,
2003; Bockel´ee-Morvan et al., 2015).

The recent years have seen signiﬁcant improvement in the
sensitivity and spectral coverage of millimeter receivers. The
EMIR receivers (Carter et al., 2012) at the Institut de radioas-
tronomie millim´etrique (IRAM) are equipped with a fast Fourier
transform spectrometer that oﬀers a wide frequency coverage at

a high spectral resolution (0.2 MHz). The combination enables
sensitive spectral surveys of cometary atmospheres and simul-
taneous observations of several molecules, including isotopo-
logues in brighter comets. We report here observations of iso-
topic ratios with the IRAM 30m radio telescope in two very ac-
tive (maximum water outgassing rate close to 1030 molec. s−1)
Oort cloud comets, C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) and C/2014 Q2
(Lovejoy), carried out in 2013 and 2015. They are both dynam-
ically old Oort cloud comets: an original orbital period of 9 800
for comet Lemmon, and
years and an orbit inclination of 83◦
a period of 11 000 years and an inclination of 80◦
for comet
Lovejoy.

The analysis of the observation in terms of molecular abun-
dances and detection of rare and new molecular species has been
reported (Biver et al. , 2014, 2015). In the present article we con-
centrate on the measurement of several isotopic ratios. We report
the detection of HDO in both comets. The compounds H16
2 O and
H18
2 O were detected in comet Lovejoy with the Odin submillime-
ter space observatory, which helped to accurately determine the
D/H and 16O/18O ratio in water in this comet.

Comet C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) was observed in March
and April 2013 (as already presented in Biver et al. , 2014).
Perihelion was on 24.51 March 2013 UT at 0.731 AU from the
Sun. We mostly used the same tunings as for comet Lovejoy with
the EMIR 1mm receiver combined with the FTS and VESPA
spectrometers. The best weather conditions were found on 14.5
and 18.5 March, but with a comet at low elevation (15-20◦),
and on 6.5 April 2013. We covered the 240–272 GHz frequency
range and obtained noisier data on the 85–93, 166–170, and 210–
242 GHz bands with the EMIR 3mm, 2mm, and 1mm receivers,
respectively. A summary of the observational setups is given in
Table 1.

In this paper we focus only on the measurement of isotopic
ratios, and spectra of isotopologues are presented in Figs. 3– 8.
The chemical inventory of these comets based on these observa-
tions with the IRAM telescope has been presented in Biver et al.
(2014, 2015) and will be further detailed in a future paper.

2. Observations

2.1. IRAMObservations

Comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) was observed with the IRAM 30m
radio telescope during two periods: on 13.8, 15.8, and 16.8
January 2015 (geocentric distance ∆ = 0.496 − 0.528 AU) and
on 23.7, 24.7, 25.7, and 26.7 January 2015 (∆ = 0.624 − 0.675
AU) under very good weather conditions. The heliocentric dis-
tances were 1.31 and 1.29 AU, respectively. Perihelion was on
30.07 January UT, at 1.290 AU from the Sun. The 13–25 and
26 January observations were conducted with the EMIR 1mm
and 3mm receivers, respectively. The main backend used is a
Fourier transform spectrometer, which covers a frequency range
of 2×8 GHz (two sidebands separated by 8 GHz, each in two
linear polarizations) in a single setup, with a high spectral reso-
lution of 200 kHz. The spectral resolution (0.3–0.2 km s−1when
converted into Doppler velocity) allows the velocity proﬁles of
the narrow cometary lines (∼ 2 km s−1) to be resolved. We also
used the high resolution VESPA autocorrelator set to 40 kHz
sampling on dedicated lines of interest (e.g., CH3OH (5+2 −
4+1E) and H15CN (3-2)), but VESPA units can only cover lines
within a 0.5 GHz window centered at 6.25 GHz in the IF band
(upper and lower side band). Using four diﬀerent tunings we
covered the 210–218, 225–233, and 240–272 GHz frequency
ranges and 85–93 and 101–109 GHz.

The half power beam width of the IRAM 30 m telescope
in the 1 mm band ranges from 9.1′′
to 11.6′′, which corre-
sponds to 3300 to 5400 km at the comet distance (22–28′′ at
3 mm corresponding to 11000–14000 km on 26.7 Jan.). Given
the expansion velocity of the coma (∼ 0.8 km s−1) and helio-
centric distance, this means that we are not very sensitive to
the photo-dissociation rate of the molecules, provided that the
molecule lifetime at 1 AU is larger than 4000 s. The pointing
accuracy (1′′-2′′) was regularly checked on reference pointing
sources and also on the comet with coarse maps. The time vari-
ation of the activity of the comet could be monitored with the
multiple strong CH3OH lines present in all setups. We did not
see any variations signiﬁcantly larger than ±20% during the ob-
servations (QCH3OH = 1.2±0.2×1028 molec. s−1, 13–16 January,
and 1.4 ± 0.2 × 1028 molec. s−1, 23–25 January), which justiﬁed
the averaging of several days of observations.

2

Because comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) clearly became a very
active comet, observations with the Odin 1.1m submillimeter
satellite (Frisk et al. , 2003) were triggered on a late notice.
Observations took place between 30.5 January and 3.4 February
2015. These observations were scheduled to map the emission
of H16
2 O at 556.9 GHz, follow its temporal evolution, and detect
the H18
2 O line at 547.7 GHz. The half power beamwidth is close
to 2.1′ at these frequencies and the main beam eﬃciency is 0.89.
Odin uses three spectrometers: a 1 GHz bandwidth acousto-
optical spectrometer (AOS with 0.6 MHz sampling) and two
autocorrelators (AC1 and AC2) used in their highest resolution
mode (∼0.15 MHz with 100 MHz bandwidth). For the ﬁrst setup,
two receivers tuned to the H16
2 O line were used in parallel, cou-
pled to the three spectrometers: AOS and AC2 on receiver 555-
B2 and AC1 on 549-A1. For the second setup, the AOS was
connected to the 572-B1 receiver tuned near the ammonia line at
572.5 GHz, but not frequency locked, while AC2 was connected
to the receiver 555-B2 and AC1 to 549-A1, both tuned to the
H18

2 O line.

As Odin is in a helio-synchronous polar Earth orbit at
550 km altitude, the comet was only observable during ∼55 min
of each 96 min orbit. The Earth was in the ﬁeld of view dur-
ing the remaining time, and the atmospheric lines were used to
calibrate the frequency scale. Some of the observations failed
to track the comet correctly, but half were successful and pro-
vided good results. Spectra of the nucleus-centered H16
2 O and
2 O lines are shown in Fig. 3 and a map of the H16
H18
2 O line is
shown in Fig. 1.

3. Modeling of the lines and model parameters

3.1. Velocityandoutgassingpattern

The mean gas expansion velocity was derived from the shape
of the lines with the highest signal-to-noise ratio. We deter-
mined a value of 1.1 to 1.0 km s−1
for comet Lemmon and
0.8 km s−1for comet Lovejoy (Table 1). As discussed hereafter,
comet Lovejoy was observed with the larger beam of Odin; a
value of 0.85 km s−1 provided a better ﬁt to the width of the wa-
ter lines. This is expected, as acceleration of the gas expansion
velocity in the coma is predicted and observed in the outer part
of the comae of active comets.

b For comet Lemmon, Combi et al. (2014) provide QH2O values in the range 7–12×1029molec. s−1during this period. Contemporaneous SWAN
measurements are slightly lower than quoted here, but they were not time-deconvolved and the average values measured by SWAN a few days
later are within 10% of those given here. Given our measured QCH3OH (Col. 9), QH2O are also in agreement with the measurement of Paganini et al.
(2014) as they yield the same QCH3OH/QH2O ratio. Nanc¸ay observations are also compatible with these QH2O although the quenching of the OH
maser is poorly constrained and the uncertainty on QOH is very large.
c For comet Lovejoy, QH2O are based on Odin and Nanc¸ay data (see text and Biver et al. (2015)).

For all molecules we used the latest spectroscopic data avail-
able in the JPL (Pickett et al., 1998) and CDMS (M¨uller et al.,
2005) databases, both for line identiﬁcation and computa-
tion of line strengths. We employed the code previously
used for other comets (Biver et al., 2007; Hartogh et al., 2011;
Bockel´ee-Morvan et al., 2012) to compute the excitation of the
rotational levels of the molecules and the line intensities. We take
into account the pumping of the rotational levels by the ﬂuores-
cence of the infrared vibrational bands, which is not expected
to play a major role at the cometocentric distances ≤5000 km
sampled in the case of comet Lovejoy. In our model molecules
slowly evolve from the local thermal equilibrium (T = 100 −
110 and 73 K, for comets Lemmon and Lovejoy, respectively;
Table 1) maintained by collisions with neutrals and electrons
close to the nucleus to spontaneous decay of the rotational pop-
ulation in the less dense parts of the coma (Biver et al., 2000,
2006). Within the accuracy of the detections, line intensity ratios
(or rotational temperatures) for methanol, and also for most other
species, are in agreement with the model (e.g., Trot(CH3CHO,
Lovejoy)= 67 ± 15 K for 68 K predicted). The density is de-
scribed with the Haser model, using lifetimes from Crovisier
(1994); Bockel´ee-Morvan et al. (2000); Crovisier et al. (2004a);
and Crovisier et al. (2004b). Line intensities are computed with
a radiative transfer code that takes opacity eﬀects into account.

4. Water production rate and time evolution

4.1. Odinmapsandexcitationofwaterinthecomaofcomet

Lovejoy

Several maps (e.g., Fig. 1) of the water emission were performed
for comet Lovejoy with Odin in order to precisely derive the
water production rate. The extension of the emission of opti-
cally thick submillimeter water lines in cometary comae is in
large part governed by the excitation mechanism of the wa-
ter rotational levels. It depends both on the temperature pro-
ﬁle and collision rates with electrons and neutrals in the in-
ner part of the coma (Biver et al., 2007; Hartogh et al., 2011;
Bockel´ee-Morvan et al., 2012). However, in the outer part (be-
yond 150′′) the line intensity mostly depends on the water pro-
duction rate (and assumed photo-dissociation lifetime), and very
little on the assumed temperature proﬁle. Dividing the gas tem-
perature by a factor of 2 only increases the derived production
rate by 10%. We used the same excitation parameters for the
H16
2 O observations with Odin, as those derived for the molec-
ular lines observed with the IRAM 30m instrument: a constant
temperature of 73 K throughout the coma and an electron den-
sity scaling factor xne = 0.5 (Zakharov et al., 2007; Biver et al.,
2007). The expansion velocity inferred from the H16

line widths is vexp = 0.85 km s−1 , slightly larger
than for the lines observed with the smaller beam of the IRAM
30m telescope. The ﬁt to the radial proﬁle of the line inten-
sity from the map (Fig. 1) is satisfactory and corresponds to
QH2O = 8.7 ± 0.7 × 1029 molec. s−1and the reduced χ2

when we include the 5% uncertainty due to the 10′′ (Frisk et al. ,
2003) pointing uncertainty. Taking into account an increase in
the velocity with distance from the nucleus does not signiﬁcantly
change the goodness of the ﬁt and the derived production rate.

2 O and H18

Since H16
2 O measurements with Odin were not si-
multaneous, but
interlaced,
in order to derive an accurate
H16
2 O /H18
2 O production rate ratio it is necessary to determine
if signiﬁcant short-time variation of the activity is present.
Inspection of production rates does suggest that time variation
is present in the data. Since the observations of H18
2 O constituted
a series of ten successive Odin orbits, we did a time averaging of
≈ 2.5 h, corresponding to two consecutive orbits of observations,
yielding a suﬃcient signal-to-noise ratio (5–10) to look for time
variations. We ﬁtted a sinusoidal time variation to the individual
measurements of the production rates of H16
2 O , inde-
pendently. We only selected the H16
2 O measurements with point-
ing oﬀsets less than ∼100′′. The results are provided in Table 2.
For both molecules, the sinusoidal ﬁt is better than assuming no

2 O than H18

time variation (χ2
ν reduced by a factor ∼2.5), and the inferred pe-
riod is similar (T p=0.922-0.940 day). A simulation of periodic
variations of the production rates anticipated a longer delay be-
tween peak outgassing and peak signal for H16
2 O (0.25
versus 0.14 day), which we took into account. We found diﬀer-
ent reference times T0 for H16
2 O , but these are strongly
correlated to the T p value. Formally, the T p-independent 1σ un-
certainty δT0 is on the order of 0.4 days. We also tried to ﬁt the
data with the same time dependence for H16
2 O , us-
ing a ﬁxed mean period of T p = 0.935 days (weighted average)
and a corresponding reference time 31.742 Jan. 2015 UT. The
goodness of the ﬁts is similar (Table 2). A larger damping of the
apparent production rate amplitude was expected for H16
2 O due
to optical depth eﬀects. From the observations the eﬀect is not
so obvious: ∆ Q/Q0 is only slightly smaller for H16
2 O than for
H18
2 O (0.19 versus 0.24). We did not investigate the possible
variation of the gas temperature with the production rate, but
this could explain a variation of the line intensity with time that
was larger than anticipated.

2 O and H18

We then combined both QH16

2 O to derive our best
estimate of the water production rate as a function of time during
the period 30 January to 3 February 2015 (last line of Table 2).
Figure 2 shows the time evolution of the production rates mea-
sured for the two water isotopologues and best ﬁt.

peak outgassing and peak intensity due to beam dilution and

Production rates are apparent production rates computed in the
stationary regime assumption. For H16
2 O the larger error bar in-
cludes a 5% uncertainty due to the 10′′ pointing uncertainty.
H18
2 O uncertainty is dominated by statistical noise. The least
square ﬁt to the combined production rate (last line of Table 2)
is overplotted.

4.3. Referencewaterproductionrates

The reference water production rates were primarily derived
from contemporaneous observations of the OH radical maser
lines at 18cm with the Nanc¸ay radio telescope. During the 12.8–
16.8 January 2015 observing period of comet Lovejoy, both ob-
servations centered on the comet and at 3.0′ oﬀset position were
used to better constrain the quenching of the maser inversion
(Gerard et al., 1998) yielding an average water production rate
QH2O = 5.0 ± 0.2 × 1029molec.s−1 (Biver et al. , 2015). For other
periods and for comet Lemmon, the observations of the OH rad-
ical could not be used to derive an accurate water production rate
owing to signiﬁcant uncertainties in the quenching of the maser
inversion. We either used the water production rates reported
elsewhere (Combi et al., 2014; Paganini et al., 2014) or made an
interpolation from the Odin observations of comet Lovejoy at
perihelion. Based on Nanc¸ay and Odin observations, we adopt
a mean QH2O = 5, 5.5, 6, and 7 × 1029 molec. s−1 for the 13–
16 January, 13–25 January, 23–25 January, and 26 January–3
February 2015 time intervals, respectively, with a ±20% time
variation possible within each time interval. Observations done
on a short time interval might be aﬀected by a periodic time vari-
ation, but this was tracked from the monitoring of the methanol
production lines, which are present in all IRAM observations
settings (Table 1).

5. Isotopic ratios

Table 3 provides the list of molecular lines (main species and iso-
topologues) observed at IRAM in comets C/2012 F6 (Lemmon)
in 2013 and in C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) in 2015 and considered in
this study. Line intensities and production rates (or upper limits)
derived using the models presented in Sect. 3 are given. The cor-
responding isotopic ratios or 3 σ limits are presented in Table 4.

241.561 GHz observed with the IRAM 30m telescope on 13-
24 January 2015 is shown below. While the H18
2 O and HDO
lines are marginally blue-shifted (∆ v = −0.07km s−1
in both
cases) the H16
2 O (110 − 101) line is asymmetric and red-shifted
(∆ v = +0.33km s−1 ) due to self absorption by the cool gas in
the foreground of this optically thick line. Vertical scale is main
beam brightness temperature and horizontal scale Doppler ve-
locity in the comet rest frame.

5.1. 16O/18OratioincometLovejoy

The analysis of Odin observations in Sect. 4.2 (Table 2) enabled
us to derive an accurate H16
2 O production rate ratio. From
the sinusoidal ﬁts and derived mean Q0 production rates, we ob-
tain:

2 O /H18

– Q0(H16
– Q0(H16

2 O )/Q0(H18
2 O )/Q0(H18

2 O ) = 493 ± 29 for the independent ﬁts;
2 O ) = 499 ± 24 for the phased ﬁts.

The second approach, which corresponds to a H16
2 O ratio
that does not vary with time, yields 16O/18O = 499 ± 24, which
is exactly the terrestrial value (498.7).

D/H=1.56 × 10−4), the highest value found in a comet, but com-
patible with the Earth value at the 3 σ level.

5.2.2. D/H ratio in comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy)

2 O and H18

The tracking of the comet activity via monitoring of the CH3OH
production rate and the precise determination of the water out-
gassing rate using OH, H16
2 O make us conﬁdent that
we have a good H2O production rate reference in order to de-
rive the D/H ratio. We report here the detection of HDO with
the IRAM 30m telescope in this comet. The HDO (211 − 212)
line was observed on 13, 15, 16, 23, and 24 January 2015.
The average yields a 4 σ detection (Fig. 3) corresponding to
QHDO = 15.3 ± 4.1 × 1025molec. s−1, hence a D/H ratio of
1.4 ±0.4 ×10−4. Although the detection is marginal, in the worse
case taking a 5 σ upper limit would yield D/H < 1.86 × 10−4,
suggesting that comet Lovejoy has a D/H ratio for water simi-
lar to that of the Earth (VSMOW D/H=1.56 × 10−4), or possi-
bly even lower. Previous measurements of the D/H ratio in Oort
cloud comets yielded values larger than VSMOW (see Sect. 6.1).

5.3. 14N/15NratioinHCN

One of the primary goals of the observing program of comet
Lovejoy was to measure the 14N/15N ratio in HCN. On January
13, 15, and 16 we ﬁrst observed the main isotopologue transition
HCN (3-2) at 265.886 GHz, then carried out longer integrations
using the setup covering the H13CN (3-2) line at 259.012 GHz
and the HC15N (3-2) line at 258.157 GHz (Fig. 5).

The HCN reference production rate was computed taking
opacity eﬀects into account. The average value for the 13–16
January period is QHCN = 4.87 ± 0.02 × 10 × 1026 molec. s−1,
using pointing at the nucleus and at 5–8′′oﬀsets – which both
yield exactly the same value. The HCN production rate based on
the hyperﬁne component HCN (J = 3 − 2, F = 2 − 2) with a total
statistical weight of 3.7% is marginally higher (+14%, 2 σ), pos-
sibly because of contamination by the wings of the main HCN
hyperﬁne components.

In order to minimize biases due to time variation of the out-
gassing and other observing uncertainties (calibration, pointing
uncertainty, etc.), we rescaled the HCN production rate to the

Fig. 4. Comet C/2012 F6 (Lemmon): average on-nucleus spec-
trum of the HDO (211 − 212) line at 241.561 GHz observed with
the IRAM 30m telescope between 14 March and 8 April 2013.
Vertical scale is main beam brightness temperature and horizon-
tal scale Doppler velocity in the comet rest frame.

5.2. D/Hratio

Thanks to the wide frequency coverage of IRAM observations,
lines of deuterated species of known cometary molecules were
observed. None were detected except the HDO (211 − 212) line
at 241.562 GHz (Fig. 3). This is not surprising as water is
over a hundred times more abundant than HCN, H2S, or H2CO.
Nevertheless, the upper limits on the D/H ratio in H2S or H2CO
in comet Lovejoy are the lowest obtained so far in a comet.

5.2.1. D/H ratio in water in comet C/2012 F6 (Lemmon)

We observed the HDO (211 − 212) line at 241.561 GHz in comet
C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) in March-April 2013. The detection of
HDO (Fig. 4) is also marginal (4 σ) and the retrieved intensity
was possibly aﬀected by poorer baselines on 8 April when we
could not use the telescope wobbler to cancel sky emission. The
inferred average HDO production rate for the period 14 March
to 8 April 2013 is QHDO = 13 ± 3 × 1026molec. s−1, yielding D/H

time when H13CN (3-2) and HC15N (3-2) were observed, using
the CH3OH production rate as a reference since several methanol
lines were observed in each setup. The correction applied to
QHCN is +10% for the 13–16 January observations and +27%
for 23–25 January. The compound HC15N (3-2) is clearly de-
tected during both periods (signal-to-noise ratios of 9 and 6).
The derived 14N/15N ratios are 145 ± 16 and 144 ± 23, for 13–16
January and 23–25 January, respectively.

The compounds HC15N (3-2) and H13CN (3-2) were not
clearly detected (Fig. 6) in comet C/2012 F6 (Lemmon), but the
2 σ value or lower limit we obtained for the 14N/15N ratio in
HCN (≥ 106 or 152 ± 72) is fully compatible with values found
in other comets.

5.4. 12C/13Cratio

The H13CN (3-2) line at 259.012 GHz is in the same spectral
band as HC15N (3-2). The production rates (assuming the same
photo-dissociation lifetime as for HCN) and relative abundances
are derived in the same way for both molecules. Owing to its

hyperﬁne structure similar to that of H12CN (3-2) (Fig 5), the
H13CN (3-2) line only contains 93% of the ﬂux in the (-1.2 –
1.2 km s−1) window and this was taken into account.

The derived 12C/13C ratios in comet Lovejoy and Lemmon
are 109 ± 14 and 124 ± 64, respectively. Within the uncer-
tainties, they are compatible with the terrestrial value (89.7)
although slightly higher (1.4 σ for Lovejoy). This trend was
also observed for comet 17P/Holmes (Bockel´ee-Morvan et al.,
2008) and Hale-Bopp (Jewitt et al., 1997). Combining the three
12C/13C measurements yields a value 2.5 σ larger than the Earth
value. This interesting result needs to be further investigated in
other comets.

The sensitivity was not suﬃcient to detect other 13C iso-
topologues. The most sensitive limit was reached for the
13CH3OH (5+2 − 4+1E) and 12CH3OH (5+2 − 4+1E) lines at
261.113 and 266.838 GHz, respectively. The derived lower limit
is 12C/13C > 61 in comet Lovejoy, compatible with the Earth
value.

ness temperature and horizontal scale Doppler velocity in the

5.5. 32S/34Sratio

The wide 8 GHz frequency coverage of the EMIR receiver at
IRAM, allows us to observe both C32S and C34S or H32
2 S and
H34
2 S lines in the same FTS spectrum since they are less than
4 GHz apart. As a consequence, the isotopic ratios do not de-
pend on any calibration or pointing eﬀects and, since the lines
are mostly optically thin, the abundance ratio is very close to
the line intensity ratio. The integration time on the H2S lines
(either around 168 or 216 GHz) was not suﬃcient to yield a sig-
niﬁcant constraint on the H32
2 S ratio. On the other hand,
the C34S (5-4) line at 241016.089 MHz was detected in both
comets (Figs. 7 and 8). The accuracy of the 32S/34S ratio in CS
is given by the signal-to-noise ratio of the C34S line, and we
found 32S/34S = 20 ± 5 and 24.7 ± 3.5 in comets Lemmon and
Lovejoy, respectively. We do not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant departure
from the Earth value of 32S/34S=22.5. The C33S line lies between
the C34S and C32S lines. The upper limit for the C33S (5-4) line
at 242.913 GHz in comet Lovejoy yields 32S/33S> 50. This is the
ﬁrst reported estimate of 33S in a comet, but this is only a lower
limit compatible with the Earth value (126.7).

6. Discussion
We measured a terrestrial value for the 16O/18O ratio in wa-
ter in comet Lovejoy, as was the case in all comets in which
this ratio had been measured before (Balsiger et al., 1995;
Biver et al., 2007; Bockel´ee-Morvan et al., 2012; Altwegg et al.,
2015; Bockel´ee-Morvan et al., 2015).

The D/H and 14N/15N ratios in solar system bodies are of par-
ticular importance as they vary from object to object, with the
heavier elements enriched in the Earth and small bodies com-
pared to Jupiter or the protosolar values. These ratios trace the
various enrichment and fractionation mechanisms that were at
play in the proto-planetary nebula. The other isotopic ratios in-
vestigated here do not show signiﬁcant variations in solar sys-
tem objects within the accuracy of our measurements. Figure 9
shows the 14N/15N versus D/H ratios measured in solar system
objects, including our new measurements presented here.

6.1. Earth-like water in comet Lovejoy

We obtained a measurement or at least a stringent upper limit
for the D/H ratio in water of two dynamically old Oort cloud
comets. We measured the lowest D/H ratio in water in a comet so

far: 1.4 ±0.4 ×10−4 (< 1.8 ×10−4; 5 σ) in Lovejoy, while the cor-
responding ratio could be four times higher in comet Lemmon.
These two D/H measurements are based on the same line in two
comets of similar activity. Comet Lemmon was slightly more
active but also two times farther away. We do not expect that
the excitation mechanism of HDO in the coma of these comets
can yield a factor of four diﬀerence in the derived production
rates. So the observed diversity in the D/H ratio can be real and
would suggest that these two comets, although they come from

the same current reservoir, were formed in diﬀerent places or
at diﬀerent times in the young solar system. In either case, this
brings additional proof that comet dynamical origin does not
imply a speciﬁc formation region in the disk. Previous studies
(Hartogh et al., 2011; Lis et al., 2013; Bockel´ee-Morvan et al.,
2012; Altwegg et al., 2015) have shown a growing diversity in
the measured values of the D/H ratio in cometary water, and
especially variations by more than a factor of 3 among Jupiter
family comets, which are thought to originate from the Kuiper

in comparison to the proto-planetary value (441, Marty et al.,
2011) (Fig. 9). The enrichment is similar to that found in NH2
(Rousselot et al., 2014; Shinnaka et al., 2015), thought to be
mostly produced by the photo-dissociation of NH3, the main
volatile carrier of cometary nitrogen (Biver et al., 2012).

Correspondingly low 14N/15N ratios are also detected in car-
bonaceous IDPs (Messenger, 2000; Floss et al., 2004). These
large enrichments with respect to solar or terrestrial values
can be explained by interstellar chemistry theories involving
ion-molecule 15N fractionation at 10 K (e.g., Wirstr¨om et al.,
2012). Recently, signiﬁcant nitrogen fractionation has been mea-
sured in dark cloud cores with ratios as low as 150 for nitriles
(Milam et al., 2015). Thus, the similarity of the 14N/15N ratios
found in comets and IDPs strengthens a putative link to inter-
stellar chemistry as the origin of isotopically anomalous organic
particles in comets.

Nevertheless, our observations conﬁrms that the trend of a
twofold enrichment in 15N compared to Earth observed in C15N
is also present in HCN. A consequence concerning the debate
of the origin of CN in cometary coma is that we cannot ex-
clude HCN as the sole parent of CN on the basis of diﬀerent
14N/15N ratios.

7. Conclusions

Chemical diversity is observed in the population of Oort Cloud
comets, with abundances varying by up to a factor of ten for
several species. The origin of this diversity is unclear and might

belt. Now we ﬁnd that a similar range of values is present
among Oort cloud comets. This is in line with the latest mod-
els (Brasser & Morbidelli , 2013), which suggest that all comets
were formed in the same extended massive original Kuiper Belt
beyond the giant planets and were later scattered to the two cur-
rent reservoirs, the scattered Kuiper disk and the Oort cloud. The
diversity in deuterium enrichment would occur because the pre-
solar cloud was initially enriched in HDO (higher D/H in water
than in H2: protosolar D/H value in H2 is 2 × 10−5, Fig.9), but
the inner warmer parts of the proto-planetary nebula lost more
of their initial enrichment in deuterated water.

6.2. 14N/15Nincomets
Measurements of 14N/15N in comets are relatively scarce.
Although the 14N/15N ratio is 5–20 times lower than the
H16
2 O /HDO ratio, the nitrogen bearing molecules in cometary
comae are less than 1% in abundance relative to water. So the
detection of 15N isotopologues requires very active comets. The
most sensitive technique is optical high resolution spectroscopy,
which has provided several detections of C15N (Manfroid et al.,
2005, 2009; Hutsem´ekers et al., 2009) and recently detections
of 15NH2 (Rousselot et al., 2014; Shinnaka et al., 2015), but
this technique only gives access to daughter species. The com-
pounds N2 and NH3 are not very abundant (Rubin et al., 2015;
Biver et al., 2012) and do not have strong lines observable from
the ground, nor do their 15N isotopologues. Only HCN is eas-
ily detectable in the radio and infrared. We report here the third
clear (S/N ¿ 10) detection of HC15N in a comet after its detection
in comets Hale-Bopp and 17P/Holmes (Bockel´ee-Morvan et al.,
2008).

We measure the same enrichment in 15N in HCN in comet
Lovejoy as in other comets, in spite of their diﬀerent dynamical
origins (Bockel´ee-Morvan et al., 2008). The same enrichment
was also found in CN in many other comets (Hutsem´ekers et al.,
2009). This is a factor of two enrichment in 15N in compari-
son to the Earth atmospheric value (272) and a factor of three

reﬂect comet formation at diﬀerent places or times in the early
solar system.

The observations presented here provide further evidence
that diversity is present in the enrichment in deuterium in
cometary water with respect to the protosolar value (HD/H2),
both in Jupiter family and Oort cloud comets, in line with the
latest scenarios of comet origins (Brasser & Morbidelli , 2013).
On the one hand, we found Earth-like D/H, 16O/18O , 12C/13C ,
and 32S/34S ratios in comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy), strengthening
the role that some comets may have played in supplying mate-
rial to the young Earth, especially complex organic molecules
(Biver et al. , 2015). On the other hand we conﬁrm the trend
of ﬁnding a systematic twofold enrichment in 15N in cometary
HCN relative to its abundance in Earth N2, whose origin is puz-
zling.

We were also able to obtain in comet C/2014 Q2 sensitive
limits, some of the best obtained so far with remote observations,
on isotopic ratios in other molecules such as D/H in H2S, H2CO,
or C32S/C33S.
