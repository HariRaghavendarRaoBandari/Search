A key ingredient in the evolution of galaxies is the star formation cycle. Recent progress in the
study of magnetic ﬁelds is revealing the close connection between star formation and its effect
on the small-scale structure in the magnetized interstellar medium (ISM). In this contribution we
describe how the modern generation of radio telescopes is being used to probe the physics of the
ISM through sensitive multiwavelength surveys of gas and magnetic ﬁelds, from the inner star
forming disk and outward into the galaxy outskirts where large-scale magnetic ﬁelds may also
play a key role. We highlight unique pioneering efforts towards performing and scientiﬁcally
exploiting large-scale surveys of the type that the SKA will undertake routinely. Looking to the
future, we describe plans for using the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its pathﬁnders to gain
important new insights into the cosmic history of galaxy evolution.

Magnetic ﬁelds in galaxies

1. Introduction

George Heald

Magnetic ﬁelds are a crucial element of galaxies, and play an important role in setting the
stage for their structure and evolution. At the scale of active star formation, the role of magnetism
is becoming clear through simulations (e.g., Birnboim, Balberg, & Teyssier 2015; Kim & Ostriker
2015) and novel observations (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016). Simulations are also key to un-
derstanding the importance of magnetism in deﬁning the multiphase structure of the interstellar
medium (ISM; e.g., Hill et al. 2012). On larger scales, it is still unclear to what degree magnetic
forces play an important dynamical role (see, e.g., Elstner, Beck, & Gressel 2014, and references
therein), but magnetic ﬁeld lines are certainly essential for guiding the propagation of cosmic rays
(see Kotera & Olinto 2011) and thus in understanding the isotropy of ultra-high energy cosmic ray
ﬂux as seen from the Earth (e.g., Alvarez-Muñiz, Engel, & Stanev 2002). Magnetic ﬁelds may
contribute to setting the properties of galactic outﬂows (see Heesen et al. 2011) and the disk-halo
interface (e.g., Benjamin 2002; Henriksen & Irwin 2016), and on the largest scales to connecting
galaxies to the intergalactic medium (IGM; e.g. Kronberg, Lesch, & Hopp 1999; Bernet, Miniati,
& Lilly 2013). A clear understanding of the properties (shape, strength, and energetic content) of
galactic magnetic ﬁelds on all scales is plainly of great astrophysical interest.

Much has been written about the “classical” techniques for detecting and characterising mag-
netic ﬁelds in galaxies. See for example Condon (1992); Heiles & Robishaw (2009); Andersson
(2015); Heald (2015); Beck (2016) and references therein. In this contribution, we focus on the
detailed study of synchrotron radiation and its polarization, although optical/infrared polarization
and Zeeman splitting also provide extremely useful and unique information about galactic mag-
netic ﬁelds. Radio synchrotron measurements can be used as powerful and highly ﬂexible probes
of various aspects of the ordered and turbulent components of the magnetic ﬁeld. It is important
to distinguish the ordered/regular components of the ﬁeld from the turbulent/tangled components.
These have different observational signatures. For an excellent summary and illustration, see Jaffe
et al. (2010). Crucially, total synchrotron intensity measurements probe the total magnetic ﬁeld
(ordered plus disordered components), while the corresponding polarized emission probes only the
ordered (but not necessarily uniformly directed) ﬁelds in the plane of the sky; the Faraday rotation
experienced by that polarized emission yields estimates of the uniformly directed (regular) ﬁeld
along the line of sight. Polarization is particularly powerful in distinguishing various subtly dif-
ferent conﬁgurations of gas, magnetic ﬁelds, and cosmic rays within the telescope beam as well as
across extended sources. It is in fully understanding and exploiting these detailed measurements
that deﬁnes the modern era of radio polarimetry. Depolarization, often viewed as a hinderance, is
uniquely sensitive to the magnetic ﬁeld structure through its strong λ 2 dependence, and provides a
detailed probe of magnetism (see, e.g., Horellou & Fletcher 2014).

A basic but powerful tool that is often used to try to make sense of broadband polarization
measurements is the Rotation Measure (RM) Synthesis technique (Burn 1966; Brentjens & de
Bruyn 2005; Heald 2009). The concept has this year reached its 50th anniversary, but it has only
been widely used in the last decade. The procedure relies on a Fourier-like relationship between
the observed linear polarization quantities (Stokes Q and U), and the amount of polarized emission
at each Faraday depth (φ) — a quantity that describes how much Faraday rotation has occurred

along the line of sight l (speciﬁcally, φ ∝(cid:82) ne(cid:126)B· d(cid:126)l). A deconvolution approach can be used to at-

tempt to isolate the true signal from the instrumental sampling function (RMCLEAN; Heald, Braun,
& Edmonds 2009). However, it has been noted that systematic issues can prevent a reliable re-
construction of the input signal when using these techniques (e.g., Farnsworth, Rudnick, & Brown
2011). As a consequence, a complementary technique is generally needed: directly ﬁtting the pri-
mary broadband QU data to theoretical models (Farnsworth, Rudnick, & Brown 2011; O’Sullivan
et al. 2012; Sun et al. 2015). In practice, a combination of these techniques should be used because
while RM Synthesis can be used arbitrarily with some important limitations, the appropriate phys-
ical model must ﬁrst be correctly identiﬁed for QU ﬁtting to be successful. Indeed, the output of
RM Synthesis and RMCLEAN can be used as a prior for running QU ﬁtting (e.g., Mao et al. 2015),
highlighting the complementary nature of the two analytical approaches.

The key distinguishing features that deﬁne various physical models are encoded in the detailed

properties of the resulting broadband depolarization.

• Beam depolarization: This is a largely λ -independent effect. It can of course be addressed

by observing with improved angular resolution.

• Faraday depolarization: These effects are all dependent on λ 2, but each has distinct features
provided sufﬁcient frequency coverage is utilized. For example, here is a partial list of simple
geometries of relevance for the discussion in § 2:

– Differential Faraday rotation (DFR): Caused by a regular ﬁeld in a region that is both
emitting and rotating. Emission originating from locations closer to the observer ex-
perience less Faraday rotation; thus polarized signal is present over a range of Faraday
depth.

– Internal Faraday dispersion (IFD): Turbulent and regular ﬁeld in a region that is both
emitting and rotating. The turbulence also generates depolarization in addition to the
DFR.

– External Faraday dispersion or inhomogeneous Faraday screen (IFS): The emitting
and turbulent rotating regions are separated, and the rotating screen is turbulent. It may
only cover part of the emitting source (partial IFS; PIFS).

– Extended partial coverage model: Partial coverage of a depolarizing screen as above
(i.e., partial IFS or PIFS), as well as a depolarizing screen associated with the emitting
source.

Modern radio telescopes are very well suited to distinguish and characterise the corresponding
astrophysical situations (Heald et al. 2015). This contribution will illustrate that depolarization
provides a highly useful tool both to learn about detailed small-scale ISM physics (§ 2), and to
‘dissect’ large-scale magnetic structure (§ 3).

Based on the use of standard techniques, as well as the careful interpretation of earlier narrow-
band data, a consistent and detailed picture of the broad properties of galactic magnetic ﬁelds has
developed over the course of the past several decades. The general structure is reviewed by Beck
(2016). Typically, galaxies demonstrate axisymmetric spiral ﬁelds in the disk, and X-shaped verti-
cal extensions when viewed from an edge-on perspective. Field strengths vary but are typically in
the range of several to tens of µG, with generally similar contributions from ordered and random

ﬁeld components. The magnetic energy density in galaxy ISMs can be comparable to, or even
greater than, that of other contributors to the energy budget. One of the areas where new progress
is now being made is in developing a better picture of the small scales, understanding the detailed
internal structure of the magnetized ISM and the connection between magnetic ﬁelds, multiphase
gas, and star formation. Meanwhile, various observational techniques are beginning to unveil the
properties of magnetic ﬁelds and gas at the outskirts of galaxies. Still, many of the observations that
have been employed so far probe two-dimensional (2D) projections of the magnetic ﬁeld structure.
By embracing the effects of depolarization, multifrequency observations now allow us to peel the
onion of galactic magnetic ﬁelds and unveil their 3D structure.

2. Small scale magnetic ﬁelds

It remains unclear how magnetic ﬁelds are organized on small scales ((cid:46) 1kpc) within galaxies.
The smallest scales can most readily be observed in the Milky Way, where a turbulent spectrum is
observed with characteristic scales reminiscent of the size of H II regions and supernova remnants,
depending on location in the disk (e.g., Haverkorn et al. 2008, and references therein). A number
of observational techniques have been brought to bear in external galaxies, including analysis of
RMs from background sources (Gaensler et al. 2005) and from the diffuse magnetized ISM itself
(Mao et al. 2015), from dispersion of RMs (Fletcher et al. 2011) or polarization angles (Houde et
al. 2013), and potentially in the future from ﬂuctuation statistics of the synchrotron intensity (total
intensity together with polarized intensity; Herron et al. 2016). Still, a comprehensive observational

picture of the small-scale structure and relevant spatial scales of interstellar magnetic ﬁelds has
not yet been developed. What are the typical properties of magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations across the
galaxy population, and what are the relative contributions of ordered and random magnetic ﬁeld
components? To what degree are these related to the structure of the gaseous ISM and the star
formation activity taking place in the disk?

Modern broadband polarimetric observations are now allowing a more detailed study of the
magnetized ISM in galaxies. An example is illustrated in Figure 1. By drawing together polariza-
tion maps of NGC 6946 at 3, 6, 13, 18, and 22 cm, Williams et al. (in prep) are able to model
the structure of the magnetized ISM using simple conﬁgurations of the type summarized in § 1. At
lower frequencies (i.e., larger values of λ 2) the data are of sufﬁciently high spectral resolution and
sensitivity that a combination of RM Synthesis and QU ﬁtting is beginning to distinguish depo-
larization caused within the emitting medium from the effect of a foreground screen. Meanwhile,
the spatial resolution (∼ 400 pc) is approaching the scale of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). New
3D descriptions of the small-scale magnetic ﬁelds in external galaxies can now be made. These
modeling efforts not only reveal how the magnetoionized ISM varies across the galaxy, but also
allows a reconstruction of the underlying large-scale magnetic ﬁeld shape, as seen in Figure 1.

3. Large scale magnetic ﬁelds

An interesting development in the past few years has been the use of depolarization as a tool
to permit ‘slicing’ galaxies into different depths to investigate the structure of the 3D ﬁeld in a
tomographic manner. For example, Heald, Braun, & Edmonds (2009) and Braun, Heald, & Beck
(2010) have used this approach to ﬁrst recognize and then interpret generally applicable, large-
scale symmetric patterns in the distribution of polarized synchrotron emission from a large number
of galaxy disks. Speciﬁcally, they noted that for moderately inclined galaxies, a minimum in
polarization consistently occurs along the kinematically receding major axis. This feature has been
subsequently recognized in other galaxy samples (e.g., Vollmer et al. 2013). It is illustrated in
Figure 2. Along with an azimuthal variation in polarized emissivity, the galaxies also demonstrate
a corresponding azimuthal variation in the Faraday rotation measure. Finally, Braun, Heald, &
Beck (2010) report ‘ghost’ polarized emission in some galaxies, at extreme values of RM (but cf.
Mao et al. 2015).

The cause of these polarized features is interpreted in the following way. Turbulent depolariza-
tion in the midplane, induced by active star formation, serves to depolarize synchrotron radiation
from within the disk and to a large degree from the back-side thick disk region as well. (Ghost
emission at extreme RM, if present, is interpreted to originate from the back-side of the disk.)
In this picture, at ∼ 1 GHz frequency, the bulk of the polarized emission originates from a layer
just above the star forming thin disk (see also Horellou et al. 1992). Due to a combination of az-
imuthal and vertical magnetic ﬁeld components, the observed polarized asymmetry is expected to
be missing from the region where the ordered magnetic ﬁeld points predominantly toward the ob-
server. Braun, Heald, & Beck (2010) model simple magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations and conclude that
the observations are consistent with a mixture of an axisymmetric spiral ﬁeld and a quadrupolar
poloidal ﬁeld. This picture works if galaxies have trailing spiral arms, as indeed seems to be the
case (de Vaucouleurs 1958). Galaxies with leading arms would be expected to have a minimum in

Figure 2: Illustration of the magnetic ﬁeld and depolarization model proposed by Braun, Heald, & Beck
(2010). Left: Axisymmetric spiral ﬁeld in the disk. Right: Quadrupolar poloidal ﬁeld as viewed from an
edge-on perspective. Due to the turbulent depolarization in the midplane (induced by active star formation
injecting energy into the ISM; blue region), strong depolarization (red region) prevents the observer from
detecting polarization at ∼ 1GHz within and behind the thin disk. Polarized synchrotron radiation (purple
region) is visible to such an observer from the front surface of the disk only. That polarized signal may be

polarization along the approaching major axis. A further prediction of the model is that the asym-
metry should vanish at higher frequency due to the lower impact of turbulent depolarization, as is
indeed seen in the case of NGC 6946 (Beck 2007) at wavelengths of 3 and 6 cm.

A rather more detailed application of the same basic analysis has been performed for the
individual case of M 51 (Fletcher et al. 2011). By drawing together a large multifrequency data set
spanning wavelengths from 3 to 20 cm, the authors were able to consider separately the thermal
electron population and magnetic ﬁeld properties in the disk and halo regions. Ultimately they
found that different spiral modes were present in the magnetic ﬁelds of the disk and halo (m = 0 +2
in the disk, and m = 1 in the halo; note that the qualitative appearance of the RM maps presented by
Heald, Braun, & Edmonds (2009) are consistent both with this model and with the interpretation
of the ∼ 1GHz emission originating from above the disk).

Low-frequency (ν (cid:46) 300MHz) synchrotron radiation probes even farther into the outskirts of
galaxies. While synchrotron and inverse Compton energy losses mean that cosmic rays no longer
emit radiation at high frequencies once they have propagated far from regions of star formation,
the low-energy cosmic ray population loses energy more slowly ( ˙E ∝ E2; Condon 1992) and thus
emits at low radio frequency for a longer span of time, i.e. τ ∝ E−1. The new generation of
low frequency radio telescopes is in this way opening the window to the outer parts of galactic
magnetic ﬁelds. For example, total intensity LOFAR observations have been used to probe into
the far outer disk (e.g., in M51; Mulcahy et al. 2014) and into the upper disk-halo interface region
(e.g., NGC 5775; Heald et al. in prep, see Figure 3). One ultimate aim for this kind of research is

6

to start to recover polarization at such large distances from the star forming disk, in order to further
constrain the ordered component of the large-scale ﬁeld (and possibly also the regular component
from associated RMs).

resolution (∼ 20(cid:48)(cid:48)) and excellent sensitivity (< 1mJybeam−1) using LOFAR. Left: Wide ﬁeld of view image

SDSS composite of the nearby edge-on galaxy NGC 5775 (Heald et al., in prep) and its vertically extended
radio halo (orange colors), visible with LOFAR extending up to 15 kpc from the star forming disk. The
companion galaxy NGC 5774 is also detected, as is a bridge of radio emission corresponding to an H I
bridge (see Irwin 1994).

At the very largest distance from the star forming regions of galaxies, where cosmic rays have
lost too much energy to be detectable in synchrotron radiation with current technology, differ-
ent methods must be brought to bear to identify and study the extended magnetic ﬁeld structure.
The Universe provides excellent probes of galactic magnetic ﬁelds on the largest scales: back-
ground polarized radio galaxies (as have been used to study the magnetic extent of galaxy clusters;
Clarke, Kronberg, & Böhringer 2001). For galaxies, a similar approach has led Bernet, Miniati, &
Lilly (2013) to ﬁnd evidence for strong magnetic ﬁelds (tens of µG) extending up to 50 kpc from
galaxies, and with properties suggestive of galactic outﬂows rather than large coherent magnetic
structures. Follow-up studies with forthcoming radio surveys will be of particular interest in the
next several years.

4. Future prospects

While recent progress in our understanding of magnetism has been rapid and very encouraging,
there is also still clearly much to learn using future radio telescopes and accompanying large-
scale survey efforts. For example, key questions remain surrounding the buildup and evolution
of magnetism in the Universe and in bound objects like galaxies; the detailed internal structure of
magnetic ﬁelds on both small and large scales in galaxies; and the interplay between magnetic ﬁelds

and the gaseous content and kinematics in galaxies. In this section, we provide a brief overview of
some of the radio surveys that are currently underway and will be pursued with the next generation
of observatories, leading to the SKA.

One interesting survey that is currently enhancing our view of the magnetic content of nearby
galaxies is called “Continuum HAlos in Nearby Galaxies – an EVLA Survey” (CHANG-ES; Irwin
et al. 2012). This project makes use of sensitive broadband continuum observations of a large
number (35) of edge-on nearby star-forming galaxies, in full polarization, at L- and C-bands (1.2−
1.9 and 5− 7GHz) using the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), or EVLA as it was known at the
time. From these observations a clear picture of the vertical extent of the magnetic component of
nearby galaxies is starting to be revealed (e.g., Irwin et al. 2012; Wiegert et al. 2015). Surveys
of this type are set to become commonplace as improvements in the sensitivity, ﬁeld of view, and
instantaneous bandwidth of radio telescopes are ubiquitous. Two aspects that will need continued
care for future efforts are (i) instrumental polarization, not just at the pointing center but across the
whole ﬁeld of view (requiring control of, and excellent understanding of, the beamshape), and (ii)
characterization of the ionospheric contribution to Faraday rotation measure.

As we look toward the horizon, the community is greatly anticipating the next generation of ra-
dio telescope facilities, amongst these the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathﬁnder (ASKAP;
Johnston et al. 2008) and the South African MeerKAT (formerly the Karoo Array Telescope; Jonas
2009). Both of these will incorporate polarimetric observations either as dedicated surveys or as
fundamental aspects of larger survey activities. These new telescopes promise to deliver both ex-
cellent polarization performance as well as the broad bandwidth that is needed to characterize the
internal structure of the astrophysical sources of interest. Particular surveys of note include the Po-
larization Sky Survey of the Universe’s Magnetism (POSSUM; Gaensler 2009) with the ASKAP
telescope, which will develop a catalog containing an estimated ∼ 3 million polarized sources over
a surveyed sky area of 30,000 square degrees. By covering the frequency range 1150− 1450MHz,
accurate RMs will be available for a large number of those sources, leading to an “RM grid” of
POSSUM sources with a density as high as 100 RMs sq deg−1. The catalog will allow large sta-
tistical studies of polarized source populations, as well as enabling investigations of the extended
magnetic structure of intervening objects along the line of sight (e.g. the Milky Way, nearby galax-
ies and clusters). In South Africa, the MeerKAT H I Observations of Nearby Galactic Objects:
Observing Southern Emitters (MHONGOOSE)1 survey will probe the magnetic ﬁelds in 30 nearby
galaxies to exquisite depth (200 hr per target) and with broadband frequency coverage. Meanwhile
the MeerKAT International GigaHertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE)2 survey will
observe broadband continuum emission in a tiered approach, covering 1000 square degrees to a
depth of ∼ 5 µJybeam−1 along with two smaller and deeper sky areas, enabling great strides in
understanding the cosmic evolution of magnetism in distant AGN and star-forming galaxies.

On somewhat longer timescales, the community is working toward transformational break-
throughs in several facets of cosmic magnetism science with the SKA. Several headline science
projects are being developed, with the highest priority embodied in a large-area, deep, broadband
survey for Faraday rotation measures (Johnston-Hollitt et al. 2015). Additional science cases in-

clude those focused on nearby galaxies (Heald et al. 2015; Beck et al. 2015), the Milky Way galaxy
(Haverkorn et al. 2015), detailed broadband studies of radio galaxies (Gaensler et al. 2015), and
intermediate-redshift normal and starforming galaxies (Taylor et al. 2015). There clearly remain
a great number of outstanding questions of fundamental importance that will be pursued in the
coming decades of radio surveys.
