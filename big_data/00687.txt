Electron vortex beams hold great promise for development in transmission electron microscopy,
but have yet to be widely adopted. This is partly due to the complex set of interactions that occur
between a beam carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) and a sample. Herein, the system
is simpliﬁed to focus on the interaction between geometrical symmetries, OAM and topology. We
present multiple simulations, alongside experimental data to study the behaviour of a variety of
electron vortex beams after interacting with apertures of diﬀerent symmetries, and investigate the
eﬀect on their OAM and vortex structure, both in the far-ﬁeld and under free-space propagation.

INTRODUCTION

Electron vortex beams, are electron states wherein the phase is structured to possess a phase singularity on axis,
with a wave function of Ψ = A(r)ei(cid:96)φeikz. The amplitude function in this simple case, is a function of r alone. The
paraxial beam propagates in the z-direction, with wave-number k. The value (cid:96) is an integer, describing the topological
charge, or winding number of the vortex. When the beam is in a simple, circularly symmetric state, (cid:96) also determines
the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the beam [1].

Such electron beams were ﬁrst considered explicitly in 2007 [2], having been alluded to previously [3, 4]. They
were demonstrated experimentally in 2010 [5–7], and have remained under intense study since. The interest in
these structured beams comes not only from a fundamental interest in their unusual behaviours [8–15], but also
from prospects for novel applications in a variety of topics. Potential applications include magnetic chiral dichroism
measurements [6, 16–18], being used to determine crystal chirality [19] and providing opportunities to use electron
vortices as an analogue of optical tweezers [20].

The application most fervently awaited for electron vortex beams is that they may enable atomic-resolution electron
magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) [6, 16, 18], with better resolution than existing methods. While early experiments
seemed encouraging, later studies revealed the complexity of the set-up, thus requiring further careful attention [21–
23].

An electron beam interacts strongly with a sample [24], which rapidly changes the shape of the wavefront. For
typical TEM sample thicknesses, multiple scattering is likely to occur, further complicating the interaction between
the beam electron and the sample. If the beam is aligned with a crystal zone-axis of the sample, the interaction is
particularly strong, and channelling will occur, biasing which parts of the sample are exposed to the probing electron
[25]. This channelling will also aﬀect the propagation of the vortex core [26, 27]. The local symmetry imposed on the
beam by the crystal structure will also aﬀect the OAM of the wave as it propagates [28]. All of these eﬀects occur
synchronously, leading to complicated details in the electron wave as it exits from the sample, and complex changes
in any recorded electron energy-loss spectrograms (as these depend on the local electron wave-function).

Here, we aim to clarify one aspect of this complex system, by studying the eﬀects of spatial conﬁnement in a
geometric symmetry on an electron vortex beam. This is loosely analogous to the eﬀects of the crystal symmetry on
the electron vortex beam, while avoiding the complexity of channelling, and other sample interaction eﬀects.

Futhermore, in previous work we noted interesting behaviour of electron vortex beams, when microscope apertures
are misaligned, or when using non-round apertures [26, 29, 30]. Particularly, following the interaction with apertures
with discrete rotational-symmetries as in Guzzinati et al. [29], it can be seen that the original beam symmetry is not
conserved, and a dark vortex core is not always found on axis. The interference between the aperture edge waves [31]
and the vortex probe, leads to an intensity proﬁle which reveals the topological charge of the input beam, in the case
of a centred, single-ringed input vortex probe [32].
Such a non-circularly symmetric constraint prevents the beam from being in an OAM eigenstate, so a high-order
vortex core may degenerate into an arrangement of multiple, displaced |(cid:96)| = 1 vortices [26]. We now deliberately
apply these unusual settings to allow a deeper study of vortex splitting, propagation and reconnection.

We will investigate the vortex structure of an electron vortex beam after impinging on an aperture of a chosen
geometry (round, square, equilateral triangle, oﬀ-centred circle), in the far-ﬁeld, and during propagation. We will
study this system both computationally and experimentally. Similar systems have been considered previously with
optical vortex beams, but only with regard to the far-ﬁeld behaviour of the beam. Here, we focus on the beam structure
during propagation, as a route to a deeper understanding of electron vortices within a sample. In the following, we
ﬁrstly compare the eﬀects of the diﬀerent geometric apertures on the far-ﬁeld wave and vortex structures, comparing
experimental data to our simulations. We then model the whole focal series of the beam, tracking the propagation of
the vortex cores through the volume. We ﬁnd a surprisingly complex vortex structure, which may be of signiﬁcance
to the development of the vortex-EMCD method.

II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

Many diﬀerent methods of producing electron vortex beams have been investigated. The ﬁrst experimental electron
vortex beam relied on an opportune stacking of graphite ﬂakes [5]. This is not easily reproducible. After that, the
holographic forked mask technique, borrowed from optics [33], was introduced [6], and developed further [7, 34–37].
Electron vortices produced through aberration manipulation were also investigated [38–41], as well as direct phase
plate production [42, 43]. These methods however, all have their own foibles - primarily, limitations to the intensity
in a given vortex order, or experimental limitations to the attainable purity of a given OAM state.

More recent developments however, have improved on this. It has been shown that illuminating the end of a long,
thin, nanoscale bar magnet, can induce a vortex character into the electron beam, while only blocking a very small
proportion of the incoming electron ﬂux [44, 45]. Experimentally, if the magnetic needle is produced suﬃciently
accurately, the resultant vortex beam can have more than 95% of the beam’s intensity in the desired OAM state [46].
While this method results in the “best” electron vortex beams currently available, it is not well suited to investigating
diﬀerent orders of topological charge, as this would require access to a set of several magnetic needle apertures. To
ensure the fairest comparison between a set of vortex beams of diﬀerent order, we will thus investigate the beams
resulting from a well-made forked holographic mask, ensuring they are suﬃciently laterally separated. This has the
beneﬁt of having high OAM-mode purity, at the expense of lower beam intensity, not critical in the present study.

By using a forked holographic mask in the condenser plane of the microscope, we are able to produce a range of
high-order vortex beams in the image plane, with diameters in the range of a few tens of nanometres (adjustable by
tuning the condenser system). In the ideal, simple case, where the mask is designed by interfering a tilted plane wave
with an exp(i(cid:96)φ) term only (with no additional amplitude modulation), and the binarisation is applied at exactly half
of the maximum intensity value, the bars in the resulting mask will be the same width as the gaps (as illustrated in
ﬁgure Ia). In this case, the only beams produced will be the zero-order central beam (with (cid:96) = 0), and odd-ordered
side beams (with |(cid:96)| = 1, 3, 5...), due to the combination of diﬀraction envelopes creating missing orders [47].

However, in many experimental cases, this does not hold true, due to the challenges in the ﬁne control of focused
ion beam (FIB) milling time [35], leading to other vortex orders appearing, at varying intensities. The milling of our
present experimental mask enables access to |(cid:96)| = (0, 1, 2, 3) vortex orders with reasonable intensities.

For maximum diﬀractive eﬀects, we want to produce the geometric apertures such that they are of a similar size to
the vortex beams at the sample plane. Producing apertures at this scale is challenging; we make use of the conjugated
selected area plane instead. There is a demagniﬁcation factor of approximately 70 between the selected area plane in
our microscope, and the image plane, allowing us to use apertures with a characteristic dimension of 2µm. This is
projected to the image plane as a characteristic dimension of 30 nm, a similar size to the vortex beams we produce
from a forked mask with diameter 10 µm (approximately 0.25 mrad) when slightly defocused to optimally ﬁll the
apertures.

In this way, we can illuminate each of the geometric apertures with electron-vortex beams of diﬀerent topological
charges. We can image the far-ﬁeld diﬀraction of each, and compare with simulations to investigate the resulting
vortex structure. Furthermore, we can also manipulate the diﬀraction and projector lenses, such as to image a full
series of the electron-vortex propagation volume, allowing us to study the free-space propagation of a pure vortex
state after passing through a speciﬁc aperture. This will show how a pure state splits into a complicated combination
of vortex states, depending on the symmetry of the system.

A. Distinguishing topological charge, and orbital angular momentum

OAM and topological charge are often used interchangeably. They do coincide in the well-studied case of a single,
on-axis vortex beam. However, in the general case, they are diﬀerent [48]. They can diﬀer in magnitude even in some

on-axis, circularly symmetric cases [49], or diﬀer in both sign and magnitude [50]. To aid clarity in the following
sections, we explicitly deﬁne these concepts here.

Topological charge is identical to winding number and is a local property. It describes the number of times the

phase passes through 2π around a closed loop, C :

(cid:96) =

1
2π

(cid:73)

dφ

(1)

If the loop itself passes through no zero intensity points, (cid:96) is constrained to being an integer. The total topological
charge in a region is only aﬀected by the discrete points of phase discontinuity within that region. For an in depth
discussion on the nature of topological charge, see the work of Dennis [51].

OAM is axis-dependent, varying strongly with where in the beam it is measured from. It is only conserved in a
circularly symmetric system [52]. Typically, in our paraxial systems, we are only interested in the z-component of the
expectation value of the OAM:

(cid:104)Lz(cid:105) = (cid:104)Ψ| ˆLz|Ψ(cid:105)

(2)

where, in cylindrical coordinates, ˆLz = −i ∂
[28, 53]. In a system with discrete, rotational symmetry, a pure input
state will broaden into a superposition of OAM modes upon propagation. The input vortex core may degenerate into
a beam with multiple ﬁrst-order vortices, displaced from the centre of the incoming beam. Pairs of +1,−1 vortices
can also be created, or annihilated within a freely propagating system, forming 3D vortex loops which do not change
the global topology of the system [26, 54].

∂ ˆθ

B. Endurance of geometrical symmetry

In addition to the propagation behaviour enforced by the conservation of topology, the standard behaviour of Fourier
optics must still apply. It is trivial to show that the intensity pattern in the far-ﬁeld of a plane wave limited by an
aperture, is the squared modulus of the Fourier transform of the wave in the aperture plane [55]. Distorting the input
wave from a planar wave-front to something else will lead to a convolution of the Fourier transform of the aperture
shape, with the Fourier transform of the input wave. Combining these eﬀects means that the complete rotational
symmetry of the incoming vortex beam is reduced to the discrete rotational symmetry of the aperture.

III. FAR-FIELD BEHAVIOUR

We begin investigating these eﬀects, by studying far-ﬁeld intensities of diﬀerent vortex beam orders on a set of

apertures, with diﬀerent rotational symmetries.

A. Simulated Results

Firstly, the far-ﬁeld results of illuminating a series of geometrical apertures were simulated. The chosen apertures
were a centred circle, an equilateral triangle, a square, and a circle displaced by half a radius.
II, these
apertures are illustrated, along with ﬁgures representing the intensity (brightness) and phase (hue) of the wave in the
far-ﬁeld of the aperture, when illuminated with the vortex beams of diﬀerent order. The vortex beam was modelled
as a beam resulting from the far-ﬁeld diﬀraction of a forked holographic mask, with the size chosen such that the
peak intensity ring of the vortex approximately matched the size of the aperture.

In Fig.

The corresponding experiments were then performed in an aberration-corrected FEI Titan3 microscope operating
at 200 keV, resulting in the data illustrated in Fig. III. The forked aperture was located in the condenser plane and

the geometric apertures were in the selected-area plane.

Comparing the simulated and experiemental far-ﬁeld images, as shown in Fig. II and Fig. III, we can see a very
good agreement in the intensity proﬁles. The results begin to diverge in the (cid:96) = 3 data set, as these beams pass at
a higher angle to the optical axis through the microscope from the forked mask and thus are more sensitive to the
residual aberrations.

The trivial (cid:96) = 0 cases simply show the intensity of a Fourier-transformed approximately-Gaussian beam, apodized
by these apertures [47]. The (cid:96) = 0 triangle case begins to reveal the discrete symmetry. Friedel’s law points out
that the Fourier transform of a real function is centrosymmetric, and thus the intensity pattern of diﬀraction from a
triangular aperture will have six-fold symmetry. However, when the conditions for Friedel’s law are broken, such as
by a non-real, or phase-structured incoming wave (such as in the |(cid:96)| ≥ 1 cases),the diﬀraction pattern is no longer
compelled to be centrosymmetric [19], and the diﬀraction pattern can then reveal more directional information about
the probe. For example, Mourka et al. established that diﬀraction of an optical vortex beam from an aperture without
180◦ rotational symmetry can determine its handedness, through interaction of the OAM-induced rotation, with the
Gouy phase [56, 57].
It has also been shown, in both light optics and electron microscopy, that diﬀraction of a
single-ringed vortex beam from a triangular aperture enables a quantiﬁcation of the topological order of the vortex

6
beam, by counting the |(cid:96)| + 1 intensity lobes found along one edge of the resultant triangular pattern of lobes [29, 32].
A closer look at the intensity proﬁle of the (cid:96) = 3 triangle case in ﬁgure III, reveals a faint intensity lobe on-axis, even
in the idealised simulation in ﬁgure II. This is unusual in coherent vortex studies, and warrants further attention. A
related unusual eﬀect can be seen in the (cid:96) = 3 square case, where in the centre of the intensity proﬁle, ﬁve dark spots
can be seen, arranged as on a die.

To investigate the cause of these eﬀects, the simulations were further developed to highlight the vortex cores and
determine their handedness. In a small, pixellated loop around a vortex core, phase aliasing errors can quickly creep
in when dealing with higher order vortices (with their rapid phase changes). To avoid this complication, images shown
in ﬁgure IV only diﬀerentiate between the left- or right- handedness of the vortices, and not their topological order.
In the ﬁrst column of ﬁgure IV, we see the standard behaviour of the unperturbed beam, the single vortex core of
each beam remains stable and on-axis, as the cylindrical symmetry permits OAM-eigenstates [58]. There are phase
jumps of π between each ring in the tails of the Airy disc, but these do not aﬀect the vortex behaviour in this
cylindrically-symmetric case.

However, in the triangle and square cases (second and third columns of ﬁgure IV) vortices are abundantly present
in the (cid:96) = 0 far-ﬁeld proﬁles. This is due to the interference between the diﬀerent sets of Fresnel fringes propagating
from the aperture sides [31] in such a way as to produce arrays of (+1,−1) vortices, similarly to the vortex lattices
produced by Niermann et al. [59].

In addition to the many vortex-antivortex pairs created in the outer region of the pattern, in some of the higher
order cases, we can also note interesting splitting behaviours of the central vortex. The splitting only occurs when the
order of the vortex is greater than half of the order of the rotational symmetry of the aperture - this inequality was
ﬁrst noted by Ferrando [52]. We see evidence of this in the (cid:96) = 2, square aperture case. It is unusual for a high order
vortex not to degenerate in a non-circularly symmetric system, but as in this case, |m| ≤ n
2 , following the notation of
Garc´ıa-March et al., where integer m is the angular momentum of the input beam, and n is the order of rotational
symmetry of the system [60]. In the case where the vortex order matches the geometrical, rotational symmetry of
the aperture, such as in the (cid:96) = 3 beam in a triangle, we see the vortex splits into (cid:96) distinct vortices of order one.
In cases where the vortex order does not match the aperture symmetry, but does surpass Ferrando’s inequality, such
that the vortex core must degenerate, additional (+1,−1) vortex pairs can be created such that both topological and
geometrical requirements are fulﬁlled. This eﬀect we see clearly in the (cid:96) = 2 triangle case, and the (cid:96) = 3 square
case where in the central region of the diﬀraction pattern, we can see extra vortex cores in ﬁgure IV. The oﬀ-centred
circle however, shows a rather diﬀerent vortex structure, due to the complete absence of rotational symmetry in the
system. In this case, the higher-order vortices split without creation of additional vortices in the central region of
the diﬀraction pattern. There are many (+1,−1) vortex pairs in the surrounding area, and particularly along a line
perpendicular to the aperture-shift direction (half of the Gouy rotation for a full image-to-image propagation [61]).
The rotations seen in the experimental case do not match this, due to the experimental diﬃculties in positioning
the aperture. We note the interesting parallel between this inﬁnite line of vortices, and the vortices resulting from a
fractional phase step [62].

C. Propagation series

The far-ﬁeld structures certainly have interesting and unusual structures, which are structurally very diﬀerent from

the input wave-fronts. For this reason, we decided to also investigate the wave-front structure upon propagation.

A simulation was built around a thin-lens model, propagating from the image plane (showing the aperture outline)
towards the back-focal plane (containing the far-ﬁeld image). This range is too large to be numerically modelled with
a simple Fresnel propagator, without encountering the sampling issues common in such propagation methods [63].
A modiﬁed linear canonical transform (LCT) algorithm was used instead, wherein the fractional Fourier transform
allows us to sample the full range of the propagation volume. The modelled system is an (cid:96) = 3 Laguerre-Gaussian
vortex beam, illuminating a square aperture. This example was selected as it displays most of the interesting features
in one system.

Experimentally, this was performed at 300 keV, with the same microscope set-up as described in section III B. The
focal series is obtained by defocussing from the far-ﬁeld intensity pattern, towards an image of the aperture. This
defocussing however, changes the currents in the diﬀraction lens, such that the principal planes, and relative position
become undeﬁned. Subsequently, the magniﬁcation of the system changes non-linearly with the defocus. For this
reason, the experimental focal series data are unscaled, and can only be compared qualitatively with the simulations.
Accordingly, the simulations are unscaled in the (x, y) plane.

The simulation and experiment match closely, as can be seen in sample images from each focal series, displayed in
Fig. V. From the simulated series, we are also able to locate the vortex cores (using the same algorithm as for Fig.
IV), in each (x, y) plane. These can then be collated over the series in z by tracking isosurfaces enclosing volumes of

high vorticity. This is shown in ﬁgure VI.

In this ﬁgure, we can see several diﬀerent regimes, as highlighted by the annotations. The incoming single vortex
at the bottom of the ﬁgure is initially stable. The vortex core then splits into a complex lattice of vortices - the
requirement of at least three-plane wave interference for a vortex lattice are met, with edge waves meeting the
paraxial beam [64], leading to the initial vortex bifurcations. Looking further from the aperture in z, the created
vortices annihilate in (+1,−1) pairs. This is possible due to the presence of more than three plane waves [65]. The
system cannot be expressed in only a few plane wave terms, and hence the output is very complex. The periodicity
of the vortex creation-annihilation loops decreases, with the frequency of the Fresnel fringes under propagation, until

the far-ﬁeld is reached, transitioning approximately as the Fresnel number approaches F = 1.

As the system reaches the far-ﬁeld, the rules deﬁned by Ferrando and Garc´ıa-March express themselves more clearly
[66], with the (cid:104)(cid:96)(cid:105) = 3 form of the beam in a square symmetry, composed of four (cid:96) = +1, and one (cid:96) = −1 vortex cores
in the central region. In this diﬀraction pattern, around 86% of the wavefront is found to still be in an (cid:96) = 3 state
(measured over the whole wave, on-axis, using the decomposition method employed in Ref. [39]).

Unlike the model system of O‘Holleran et al., we do not see any interlinked, closed loops [67]. This is probably due
to the predominant z-only momentum of the system. Unlike Dennis et al. we do not see any knots (excluding the
unknot) [68], due to the non-generic aperture shapes required to produce a knot.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have studied the propagation of vortex cores in electron vortex beams in non-rotationally symmetric systems.
High-order vortex cores were shown to split, and it is demonstrated that a stable far-ﬁeld pattern, can include more
vortex-antivortex pairs than were present in the initial condition. The propagation volume leading to such patterns
was investigated for the ﬁrst time, and its complexity was studied. The vortex structure under near-ﬁeld conditions
was found to be exceptionally detailed.

The instability of vortices, and the ease with which they can be created under propagation, are signiﬁcant con-
tributing factors to the challenges in utilising electron vortex beams to reproducibly measure magnetic states of a
material using electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). The results presented in this paper suggest that to optimise
vortex-EMCD, the eﬀect of the lattice symmetry on the vortex beam needs to be minimised, perhaps through careful
selection of beam convergence angle, and channelling conditions.
