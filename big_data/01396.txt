Abstract

Abell 754 is a galaxy cluster in which an ongoing merger is evident on the plane of the sky, from

the southeast to the northwest. We study the spatial variation of the X-ray spectra observed

with Suzaku along the merging direction, centering on the Fe Ly α / Fe He α line ratio to

search for possible deviation from ionization equilibrium. Fitting with a single temperature

collisional non-equilibrium plasma model shows that the electron temperature increases from

the southeast to the northwest. The ionization parameter is consistent with that in equilibrium

(net > 1013 s cm−3) except for a speciﬁc region with the highest temperature (kT = 13.3+1.4
where net = 1011.6+0.6
ionization parameter is 0.36–76 Myr at the 90% conﬁdence level. This time scale is quite

−1.1 keV)
−1.7 s cm−3. The elapsed time from the plasma heating estimated from the

short but consistent with the traveling time of a shock to pass through that region. We thus

interpret that the non-equilibrium ionization plasma in Abell 754 observed is a remnant of the

shock heating in the merger process. We, however, note that the X-ray spectrum of the speciﬁc

1

region where the non-equilibrium is found can also be ﬁtted with a collisional ionization plasma

model with two temperatures, low kT = 4.2+4.2

−1.5 keV and very high kT > 19.3 keV. The very high
temperature component is alternatively ﬁtted with a power law model. Either of these spectral

models is interpreted as a consequence of the ongoing merger process as in the case of that

with the non-equilibrium ionization plasma.

1 Introduction

Galaxy clusters are the largest virialized structures in the universe, hosting hot plasmas with tempera-
tures of 107−8 K as the intracluster medium (ICM) and dark matters. The galaxy clusters have evolved
primarily via their subcluster mergers, which are the most energetic phenomenon with largest size
shock waves after the big bang. Observations show many cases of merging clusters (e.g. 1E0657-56:
Markevitch et al. 2002, Abell 2256: Tamura et al. 2011, CIZA J2242.8+5301: Ogrean et al. 2014),
and discontinuities in temperature, electron density, or pressure distributions are identiﬁed as evi-
dence of shocks in some clusters (e.g. Abell 520: Markevitch et al. 2005, Abell 3667: Akamatsu et
al. 2012).

When a shock passes through a plasma, the plasma is heated by the shock efﬁciently. The
timescale for the thermal equilibration between heated electrons through their Coulomb scatterings is
expressed as

te−e ∼ 4 × 104 yr (cid:18)

ne

10−3 cm−3(cid:19)−1(cid:18)

3/2

Te

5 × 107 K(cid:19)

(see Spitzer 1962), while that for the collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) is expressed as

tion ∼ 3 × 107 yr (cid:18)

ne

10−3 cm−3(cid:19)−1

(1)

(2)

(for Fe He α and Fe Ly α in a plasma with the temperature kT of several keV; see also Masai 1984,
Akahori and Yoshikawa 2010), where ne and Te are the number density and temperature of electrons,
respectively. Since tion is much longer than te−e, the non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) state can persist
for a certain period after the shock passes through the plasma.

Although observational evidence of NEI plasma is widely conﬁrmed for supernova remnants
(e.g. Tsunemi et al. 1986, Vink et al. 2003, Katsuda et al. 2008), the ionization state of the ICM
is usually taken to be CIE, because te−e and tion are much shorter than the evolutional timescale of

2

clusters. There are a few works to examine this assumption (e.g. Fujita et al. 2008), observational ev-
idence of NEI plasmas in galaxy clusters has not been found yet. Nevertheless, in the case of merging
clusters, the NEI state might remain speciﬁc regions near shocks where the period after the plasma
heating is short. In fact, numerical simulations of merging clusters (e.g. Takizawa 1999, Akahori and
Yoshikawa 2010) predict the NEI state in some locations in their simulated merging clusters. The
N -body/SPH simulation carried out by Akahori and Yoshikawa (2010) shows that the line intensity
ratio of Fe ions, Fe Ly α / Fe He α, deviates from that in the CIE state at the corresponding location
of the shock. If we observe an NEI plasma with the ionization parameter net < 1013 s cm−3, we can
quantitatively estimate the timescale after the shock heating.

As mentioned above, the ionization state of the ICM has been examined in a limited number
of papers. Fujita et al. (2008) reported the ionization state of the Ophiuchus cluster observed with
the Suzaku satellite (Mitsuda et al. 2007). The Ophiuchus cluster is hot and bright enough for us to
examine the line ratio of Fe Ly α to Fe He α in its spatially resolved X-ray spectra. Nevertheless, Fujita
et al. (2008) concluded that the ICM of the Ophiuchus cluster reached ionization equilibrium over the
whole cluster. Nevalainen et al. (2010) also examined the Fe line ratios in 6 nearby relaxed clusters
observed with the XMM-Newton EPIC primarily for a calibration purpose. As a result, temperatures
derived from Fe line ratios were consistent with those estimated from the X-ray continua for all
the clusters. They conﬁrmed not only their calibration accuracy, but also little deviation from the
CIE state. The ionization state in the ICM has been tested in merging clusters using various plasma
emission models (e.g. Abell 2146: Russell et al. 2012, CIZA J2242.8+5301: Akamatsu et al. 2015).
Nevertheless, only lower limits of ionization parameters were obtained. They found no signiﬁcant
evidence of NEI plasmas even in merging clusters.

In this paper, we search for an NEI plasma in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 754 using the
Suzaku data. Deviation from the ionization equilibrium would be key information on the past of the
merging process. We adopt the Hubble constant H0 =70 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.2 and Ωλ = 0.8.
Unless otherwise noted, errors correspond to 90% conﬁdence intervals.

2 Abell 754

Abell 754 is a well-studied major merger cluster on the plane of the sky at z = 0.0542 (Struble &
Rood 1999). Its surface brightness is elongated along the southeast-northwest direction. Previous
works studied its galaxy distribution (e.g. Fabricant et al. 1986, Zabludoff & Zaritsky 1995), the
proﬁle of the radio emission (e.g. Kassim et al. 2001, Bacchi et al. 2003, Kale & Dwarakanath 2009,
Macario et al. 2011), the X-ray morphology and the temperature structure in the ICM (e.g. Markevitch

3

et al. 2003, Henry et al. 2004, Macario et al. 2011). These works reveal the followings:

• Neither of the two major clumps in the galaxy distribution corresponds to the X-ray brightness

peaks.

• Spatial variations of the temperature are found with highest temperature kT > 10 keV.
• The 1.4 GHz radio diffuse emission consists of two large components (Bacchi et al. 2003), roughly

correspond to the two large main galaxy concentrations.

These features indicate Abell 754 is undergoing a recent major merger. Hydrodynamic simulations
carried out by Roettiger et al. (1998) reproduce the observed X-ray features by considering an off-
axis merger between two subclusters with a mass ratio of 2.5 : 1. They also imply the merger is
a very recent one (<0.3Gyr). Markevitch et al. (2003) suggests that a more complex picture for
the merger in which the third subcluster or a cloud of a cool gas is sloshing independently from its
former host subcluster. Macario et al. (2011) ﬁrst conﬁrmed the shock front with the Mach number of
M = 1.57+0.16
−0.12 at the southeast part of the cluster by measuring the temperature jump with Chandra.
They also noticed the edge of one radio emission coincide with this temperature jump. In this paper,
we call this ”shock-SE”. Shock-SE supports the idea that the merger takes place along the southeast
and northwest axis, although parameters for the merger are loosely constrained.

Besides, using the BeppoSAX data, Fusco-Femiano et al. (2003) reported the ∼ 3σ detection
of a hard X-ray excess above ∼ 45 keV. They discuss two possibilities of this excess: the emission
from the BL Lac object, 26W20, in the ﬁeld of view of BeppoSAX, or the inverse Compton emission
from relativistic electrons.

3 Observation and data reduction

The Suzaku observation of Abell 754 was performed with an effective exposure of 109 ks from 2007
May 29 to 2007 June 1. Suzaku has four X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS; Koyama et al. 2007)
cameras. Three of the XIS (XIS0, 2, 3) and the other (XIS1) employ front-illuminated (FI) CCDs and
a back-illuminated (BI) CCD, respectively. Since XIS2 has been out of function from 2006 November
9, we use the other three XIS (i.e. XIS0, 1, 3). The observation was performed with either the
normal 3 × 3 or 5 × 5 mode, and we combined these data in our analysis. The non X-ray background
(NXB) was produced with the FTOOL xisnxbgen (Tawa et al. 2008) using the night-earth data taken
150 days before and after our observation. The NXB was subtracted from the X-ray spectra, while
we include the X-ray background in the spectral ﬁtting model. The response matrix ﬁles and the
auxiliary response ﬁles (ARFs) were generated by the FTOOL xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen (Ishisaki
et al. 2007), respectively. As well as the XIS data, the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD; Takahashi et al.

4

2007, Kokubun et al. 2007) data were also employed. We use the screened event ﬁle of the Si PIN
diode (HXD-PIN), including a dead-time correction. For the NXB of HXD-PIN, we use the simulated
event ﬁle supplied by the HXD team based on the LCFITDT model (Fukazawa et al. 2009). We apply
the response matrix for a point source at the XIS nominal position supplied by the HXD team.

4 Analysis and result

We use XSELECT ver. 2.4 for extracting images and spectra. Figure 1 shows the XIS0 image of Abell
754 in the 2–10 keV energy band. We deﬁne six box regions (Reg1–6) along the merging direction.
We extract the X-ray spectrum from each region. In this analysis, we ﬁnd bright point sources neither
in the Suzaku nor XMM-Newton image (Henry et al. 2004). We employ XSPEC ver. 12.8.2n to
perform spectral ﬁtting. X-ray spectra in the 2–10 keV and in the 2–8 keV bands are used for the FI
CCDs and BI CCD, respectively. The FI spectra added together. Since Tamura et al. (2014) reported
that the systematic deviation of the energy scales between the FI and BI CCDs is only 0.09%, we ﬁt
FI and BI spectra with the same model parameters. Each spectral bin has a minimum count of twenty.
In these energy bands, the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is the only X-ray background component
we should consider. We adopt the powerlaw model with the parameters presented by Kushino et al.
(2002) for the CXB model. In this paper, we report the metal abundances relative to the solar values
in Anders and Grevesse (1989).

In the following analyses, we use the plasma code ver. 3.0.0 (vvrnei model1) installed in
XSPEC. The vvrnei model is identical to the Kazik Borkowski’s NEI model (Borkowski et al. 2001)
except that the vvrnei model has a parameter to specify the initial plasma temperature. Unless oth-
erwise noted, we ﬁx this initial temperature at 0 keV. In this paper, we call the vvrnei model by
setting net as a free parameter ”NEI model”, while the same model with net ﬁxed at 1013 s cm−3 ”CIE
model”.

4.1 Spectral ﬁtting procedures

The X-ray telescope (XRT) of Suzaku has a half power diameter of 1.8 −2.3 arcmin (Serlemitsos et al.
2007). Incident photons from one sky region contaminate to other extraction regions. In this paper, we
ﬁt the spectra extracted from each region simultaneously by taking the photon contamination to each
extraction region from its adjacent regions into account. We assume the emission of each sky region
consists of the position-dependent ICM component (NEI model) and the uniform CXB component
(powerlaw). The ICM component in each extraction region consists of the ICM emission of the

5

corresponding sky region and those from the adjacent sky regions. Proper auxiliary response ﬁles
(ARF) are prepared using xissimarfgen (Ishisaki et al. 2007). In order to estimate the photons from
the outer part of the Suzaku ﬁeld of view, we deﬁne Reg0 at the southeastern side of Reg1 (ﬁgure 1).
On the other hand, contamination to Reg6 from its northwest adjacent region is neglected. We input
the XMM-Newton images (0.2–12 keV) of Reg0–3 and the Suzaku images (1–5 keV) of Reg4–6, as
the photon distributions needed for xissimarfgen.

First the spectra extracted from each region (Reg1–6) are ﬁtted simultaneously, employing
the NEI models for the ICM component. In the ﬁtting, the normalization ratio between the emission
model of Reg0 and that of Reg1 is ﬁxed at the ratio of the count rates between them estimated by the
XMM-Newton data. Other parameters of the Reg0 model are linked to those of the Reg1 model. The
comparison with the X-ray image and the numerical simulation suggests that Abell754 is a merger
on the plane of the sky (Roettiger et al. 1998). We thus assume the redshifts of all the regions are
equal and obtain them to be 0.05393+0.00012
−0.00018. Note that this redshift is consistent with that determined
by optical observations (Struble & Rood 1999). The best ﬁt parameters for the ICM components
determined here are employed to model the contamination from the adjacent sky regions.
In the
following analysis, we perform the spectral ﬁtting for each sky region individually, by ﬁxing spectral
model of adjacent region.

4.2 Line intensity ratio of Fe Ly α / Fe He α

Before detailed analyses by plasma emission models, we ﬁrst examine the line intensity ratio of
Fe Ly α to Fe He α for the six regions. The ICM component is empirically modeled with a
bremsstrahlung continuum and two Gaussian lines. The CXB component and the contamination
from adjacent regions are considered as noted in section 4.1. Figure 2 shows the Fe Ly α / Fe He α
line intensity ratio and the electron temperature of each region. The X-ray spectrum of Reg6 does
not have enough statistics to constrain the line intensity ratio, and thus is not included in the plot.
Respective blue and magenta curves indicate the line intensity ratio of Fe Ly α / Fe He α expected
from the CIE model and that of the NEI model with net = 1012 s cm−3. We note that the line ratio in
Reg5 shows a hint of NEI plasma, while the line ratio is almost consistent with that in the CIE state
for other regions. We also note that the value of the Fe line ratio in Reg2 is signiﬁcantly larger than
the CIE model, which might imply an over-ionizing plasma.

6

4.3 Fitting with a plasma emission model

We next perform individual spectral ﬁtting by employing the XSPEC plasma code, NEI models for
the ICM component. The redshift is ﬁxed at the value (z = 0.05393) determined in the simultaneous
ﬁt described in section 4.1. Henry et al. (2004) and Macario et al. (2011) show that the temperature
in the outer (pre-shock) region is about 5 keV (see region 12 in Henry et al. 2004 and ﬁgure 3 in
Macario et al. 2011). Thus, we assume the initial electron temperature of the NEI plasma to be 5 keV.
The X-ray spectrum of each region with its best ﬁt model is shown in ﬁgure 3, while the best ﬁt
parameters are summarized in table 1. Both the upper and lower bounds of the ionization parameter
are constrained in Reg5, while only the lower limits are obtained in other regions.

In this analysis, we ﬁx the components of photon contamination from adjacent regions.
However, since the photon contamination from Reg5 to Reg6 is signiﬁcant to the intrinsic Reg6
component, uncertainties in the parameters of the Reg6 component are large. Hence, we also ﬁt the
spectra of Reg5 and Reg6 simultaneously by setting the parameters of each emission model free,
while the component of photon contamination from Reg4 to Reg5 are ﬁxed. Even in this ﬁtting the
ionization parameters are constrained as shown in Table 2, indicationg the NEI state.

In the individual ﬁtting of Reg5, we obtain the relatively low abundance comparing to Reg4
(Table 1). For reference, we perform the spectral ﬁtting of Reg5 by ﬁxing the abundance to the 90%
upper limits of abundance in Reg5, 0.168 solar. In this case, the only lower limit of the ionization
parameter is constrained (1012.1(> 1011.8) s cm−3).

In these ﬁtting, we ﬁx the redshift to the value determined in the simultaneous ﬁtting for 6
regions. If we set the redshift to be free for Reg5, the ﬁtting result is z = 0.062+0.012
−0.009 and net =
1011.7(> 1011.0) s cm−3. Although this value of net is consistent with the CIE, the redshifts of 0.062
is different from that for the common 6 regions by about 3000 km/s. This difference is too large for
the cluster merging in the plane of the sky.

4.4 Spatial distribution of the ICM plasma parameters in Abell 754

We plot spatial distributions of the ICM plasma parameters determined in section 4.3 and ﬁgure 4.
The upper left panel of ﬁgure 4 shows a temperature distribution. The temperature increases from
Reg1 to Reg5, and the temperature of Reg6 is statistically equal to that of Reg5. The right panel
of ﬁgure 4 shows the ionization parameters for each region. Only in Reg5, the upper bound of the
ionization parameter is smaller than the CIE value (green line).

We next calculate the electron density of the ICM from the best ﬁt values of the normalization
in the NEI model. For this calculation, a three dimensional proﬁle model of the ICM density is

7

needed. This is not trivial, especially for merging clusters with complicated morphology as in our
case. Figure 5 shows the background-subtracted one-dimensional surface brightness map of Reg6
projected to the direction perpendicular to the red axis in ﬁgure 1. For each of six region (Reg1–
6), the surface brightness map is well-ﬁtted by a Gaussian model. We assume that the ICM proﬁle
of Abell 754 can be approximated with a group of cylinders with different radii and axes as shown
in ﬁgure 6 and each cylinder has a uniform density. The radius of each cylinder R is calculated
as R = 2σGauss, where σGauss is the standard deviation of the Gaussian model ﬁt for the surface
brightness, if we approximate the Gaussian proﬁle with the hemisphere proﬁle of the same variance.
The best ﬁt values of the radii and the volume of the cylinders are summarized in table 3. The electron
densities evaluated by using these cylindrical geometries are shown by red points in the bottom panel
of ﬁgure 4 and in ”cylindrical assumption” row of table 4. We found two peaks at Reg1 and Reg4
in the bottom panel of ﬁgure 4. The signiﬁcance of the second peak in Reg4 is ∼ 7.9σ. The peak in
Reg4 corresponds to the subcluster, which is consistent with the XMM-Newton observation (Henry
et al. 2004).

In Reg4–Reg6, an alternative assumption of spherical symmetry could be applied. Assuming a
β-model proﬁle (Cavaliere & Fusco-Femiano 1978) to a northwest part of the subcluster, we estimate
the electron densities for Reg4–Reg6 as well. We use the β-model convolved by the Suzaku point
spread function (PSF) to ﬁt the radial proﬁle as is done in Inoue et al. (2014) and Mori et al. (2013).
We estimate the Suzaku PSF with the FTOOL xissimarfgen (Ishisaki et al. 2007). Figure 7 shows the
radial surface brightness map from the central position of Reg4 toward Reg6 with the best ﬁt β-model
of rc = 2.67 ± 0.01(arcmin) = 179.5 ± 0.7(kpc) and β = 0.444+0.002
−0.003. These parameters are consistent
with those of a large sample of galaxy clusters (e.g., Mohr et al. 1999; Ota & Mitsuda 2004; Ota et
al. 2006). Using this β-model, we average the electron density for each region within a radius of 3rc.
The blue points in the bottom panel of ﬁgure 4 and ”spherical assumption” row in table 4 show the
electron density estimated by the best ﬁt β-model. The difference is only a factor of 1.0–1.2 between
the electron densities under the spherical assumption and those under the cylindrical assumption. In
the following discussion, we apply the values evaluated by the cylindrical assumption.

4.5 Analysis of Reg5 with two temperatures CIE model

We ﬁnd an NEI plasma at Reg5 in section 4.3. Nevertheless, this result might depend on the ICM
emission model employed. Although we assumed a single temperature NEI model in section 4.3, a
two-temperature CIE plasma model might be another possibility. We then ﬁt the X-ray spectrum of
Reg5 with a combination of two CIE models for the ICM component. The abundances are linked

8

between the two CIE models. Redshifts are commonly ﬁxed to the value determined in section 4.1
(z = 0.05393). Figure 8 shows the spectrum of Reg5 with the best ﬁt model under this assumption,
while the best ﬁt parameters are summarized in table 5. The spectrum of Reg5 is well ﬁtted with
this two-temperature CIE model. Note, however, that the very high temperature (kT > 19.3 keV)
component can be also ﬁtted with a powerlaw model.

4.6 Analysis of the HXD data

As mentioned in section 2, Abell 754 hosts a radio halo extended over almost its whole region
(Macario et al. 2011). It means there exist high-energy electrons, which can reproduce a non-thermal
hard X-ray emission via an inverse Compton process. The HXD on Suzaku, which simultaneously
observes the same source as the XIS, is useful to study this component. The dead-time corrected raw
HXD count rate in 15–40 keV energy band is 0.3586 ± 0.0019 counts s−1, where the 1 σ statistical
error is shown, while the NXB and the CXB modeled count rate are 0.2998 ± 0.0006 counts s−1 and
0.0161 counts s−1 (Boldt 1987), respectively. The net count rate in which the NXB and the CXB
are subtracted is 0.04287 ± 0.00206 counts s−1, corresponding to 14.3% of NXB. This is signiﬁcantly
larger than systematic errors in the NXB model (Fukazawa et al. 2009), indicating that Abell 754 is
positively detected with the HXD.

Our next concern is whether this hard X-ray emission can be reproduced only with an exten-
sion of the thermal components observed with the XIS or an extra non-thermal component is required.
We consider a spectral model consisting of the CXB and seven thermal components (Reg0–6) deter-
mined with the XIS spectra as described in section 4.3. The parameters of all the thermal components
and those of CXB are ﬁxed to the values shown in table 1 and the values reported by Boldt (1987),
respectively, allowing only one free parameter to tune the entire normalization between the HXD and
the XIS. We prepare the HXD ARFs for each spatial region by using hxdarfgen and apply them to the
corresponding thermal component.

Figure 9 shows the ﬁtting result in the 10–30 keV band. The best ﬁt values of the normaliza-
−0.033 (χ2/d.o.f.= 85.91/51). According to the Suzaku memo2, the
tion factor for the HXD is 0.969+0.033
systematic difference between the HXD and the XIS is 1.132 ± 0.014, which is the expected value of
the normalization factor we introduced in the ﬁtting. The systematic uncertainty of the NXB model
of 2.1 − 2.7% (Fukazawa et al. 2009) yields systematic error of 0.2 for the normalization. The differ-
ence between observed and expected values for the normalization is smaller than this value. We thus
conclude that the HXD spectrum is reproduced only with the thermal components we modeled for

2 http://www.astro.isas.jaxa.jp/suzaku/doc/suzakumemo/suzakumemo-2007-11.pdf

9

the XIS spectra. The hard X-ray excess (> 45 keV) such as reported by Fusco-Femiano et al. (2003)
is not needed to reproduce the HXD spectrum in the 10–30 keV band.

We also note that the counting statistic of our HXD data does not allow us to distinguish two
possibilities, i.e., the single temperature NEI model or the two-temperature CIE model wit respective
to Reg5.

5 Discussion

We have performed the spectral analysis of Abell 754 with the NEI plasma model. The spatial distri-
bution of the electron density shows two peaks at Reg1 and Reg4. The peak at Reg1 corresponds to
the main cluster, while that at Reg4 does the subcluster, both of which are merging. This is consistent
with the previous view suggested by the XMM-Newton observation of this cluster (Henry et al. 2004).
The temperature distribution of Abell 754 shows a gradient along the merging direction and takes its
highest value of 13.3+1.4

−1.1 keV at Reg5.

The main ﬁnding of this paper is the NEI plasma at Reg5. This is suggested both from the line
intensity ratio between Fe He α and Fe Ly α in the empirical model ﬁtting and from the ionization
parameter net derived in the single temperature NEI plasma model ﬁtting. We, however, cannot rule
out the possibility that the ICM component in Reg5 consists of two CIE components with different
temperatures.

If the single temperature NEI model is adopted, we are able to discuss past history of
the plasma in Reg5 quantitatively as we expected. With the ionization parameters we obtained
(net = 1011.6+0.6
−1.7 s cm−3) and the electron density we evaluated (ne = 0.740 ± 0.023 × 10−3 cm−3),
the timescale after the plasma heating is obtained to be 0.36–76 Myr at the 90% conﬁdence level.
This is rather short comparing with the evolutional timescale of clusters. However, if there is another
shock wave at the boundary between Reg5 and Reg6 (we call it ”shock-NW”), in addition to shock-
SE identiﬁed by Macario et al. (2011) near Reg0, this timescale is consistent with the time after the
shock passage. Although the errors in the temperatures derived in the ﬁt and the spatial resolution
of Suzaku are not small enough to constrain, a possible temperature jump from 14 keV at Reg5 to
10 keV at Reg6 is not ruled out. If there is the temperature jump, we can apply the Rankine-Hugoniot
condition with an adiabatic index γ = 5/3. This temperature jump corresponds to the shock with the
Mach number relative to the pre-shock region ∼ 1.4 and that relevant to the post-shock region ∼ 0.89.
Since the post-shock velocity is 1300 km/s, the timescale that shock-NW passes through the half of
Reg5 is ∼69 Myr, consistent with the timescale we derived from the ionization parameter.

In the spectral analysis with plasma models, we have roughly assumed the initial temperature

10

is 5 keV. Initial temperatures slightly alter the ionization timescale. We ﬁt the spectra using the plasma
model with different initial temperatures, 0.1, 1, 7 keV. As shown in table 6, the timescales in almost
cases are consistent with that for shock-NW passing through the region.

The temperature jump between Reg5 and Reg6 is just our speculation, and we have to wait
future observations. Nevertheless, Macario et al. (2011) suggested a coincidence between the edge
of the radio emission and shock-SE they identiﬁed with the Chandra data near Reg0. We notice that
the other edge of the radio emission roughly corresponds to shock-NW, indirectly supporting our
hypothesis.

We also notice a hint of over-ionized plasma at Reg2 in ﬁgure 2. Applying an over-ionized
plasma model with an initial temperature of kTinit = 15 keV to the ICM component of this spectrum,
we obtain the relaxation timescale of net = 1011.78+0.40
−0.34 s cm−3. While it is difﬁcult to explain a mech-
anism to make an over-ionized plasma in the ICM, we notice that the simulation of merging clusters
by Akahori and Yoshikawa (2010) shows speciﬁc regions where the Fe line ratio is consistent with
the over-ionized plasma (see ﬁgure 6 supplied by Akahori and Yoshikawa 2010). This feature is more
prominent in the case of the collision between clusters with different masses. The possibility of an
over-ionized plasma in the ICM is an issue for future study.

Go back to the ICM model at Reg5, another interpretation is a two-temperature CIE com-
ponent. The best ﬁt values of the temperatures are 4.1+4.2
−1.5 keV and 31.5(> 19.3) keV. Although the
averaged temperature of entire Abell 754 is ∼ 9 keV, we cannot deny the possibility that the cool
component is a remnant of a cool core before merging. In fact, setting the initial condition of the
temperatures to ∼ 3 keV and ∼ 7 keV, Roettiger et al. (1998) well reproduced the temperature map of
Abell 754 by numerical simulation. The component of the very high temperature suggests there may
be extremely hot region at Reg5 which is strongly heated by a merger (see Ota et al. 2008). Such high
temperature component is also approximated with a powerlaw model as reported by Fusco-Femiano et
al. (2003), although it is not detected signiﬁcantly in the HXD spectrum in the 10–30 keV energy band
(section 4.6). The Hard X-ray imaging performed by NuSTAR (Harrison et al. 2013) or hard X-ray
imager installed on ASTRO-H (Takahashi et al. 2012) will help us to distinguish these hypotheses.

Whichever interpretation, the single temperature NEI or the two temperature CIE, is correct,
we consider the merging process cause a deviation from the single temperature CIE model at Reg5.
Discrimination of these two with future observations must be important to understand the merging
history and physics in this cluster, and clusters in general.

6 Summary

We performed the X-ray spectral analysis of Abell 754 observed with Suzaku. Assuming a single
temperature plasma model at each region, we measured the spatial distributions of plasma parameters
along the merger axis. The temperature increases from southeast to northwest and highest at Reg5
(kT = 13.3+1.4
−1.1 keV). The ionization parameter deviates from its equilibrium value only at Reg5 (net =
1011.6+0.6
−1.7 s cm−3), suggesting the NEI plasma at that region. The timescale after the plasma heating
in this region is estimated from the ionization parameter, and is 0.36–76 Myr at the 90% conﬁdence
level. This timescale is rather short but consistent with the time after the shock passage, if we assume
the shock front at the boundary of Reg5 and Reg6 (shock-NW). On the other hand, another possibility
in which the ICM at Reg5 consists of two-temperature CIE plasma is not ruled out. Even in that case,
we suspect the very high (> 19.3 keV) temperature component, which might also be a non-thermal
component, is due to merging process in this cluster.
