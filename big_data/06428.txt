Abstract

We prove the determinant connectivity matrix formula. Mathematically,
the proof introduces novel techniques based on an algebraic approach and
connectivity properties. Although this is the second part of a previous paper
and has its original motivation there, the paper is self contained and the
result is interesting in itself.

Keywords: Network Reliability, Graph Theory, Factorization

1. Introduction

Denote by P artn the set of partitions of {1, 2, . . . n}. We will call the
partition {{1, 2, . . . n}} the trivial partition. The set P artn has a monoid
structure with unit {{1},{2}, . . .{n}} under the following product: given
the partitions A and B, the product A·B is the ﬁner partition that is coarser
to A and coarser to B. Observe that the product of any partition with the
trivial one is trivial.

Figure 1 shows some useful notational and diagrammatical ways to rep-
resent a partition. Observe that the product of two partitions is trivial if
and only if the resulting diagram after joining their respective vertices is
connected (in the usual topological sense). Figures 2 and 3 show examples
of connected and non connected diagrams.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Considering an ordering in P artn, we deﬁne the matrix
A = (aij) by aij = 1 if Ai · Aj is trivial and aij = 0 if it is not. The matrix
A will be called the connectivity matrix.

This paper is about the connectivity matrix and the proof that it is in-

vertible. Moreover, we prove the main theorem of this paper:

Theorem 1.1. The determinant of the connectivity matrix A is:

det(A) = ± (cid:89)

A∈P artn

(mA − 1)!

where mA is the number of classes in the partition A. In particular, A is
invertible.

We observe that the left hand side of the equality is in some sense topo-
logical (it is related to connectedness) while the right hand side is purely
combinatorial.

2. Algebra of partitions

We will identify a partition with its symmetry: i.e. there is a one to one
correspondence between partitions of {1, 2, . . . n} and the subgroups gener-
ated by transpositions of the permutation group Sn (see [BM], [Ro]).
For this purpose, we deﬁne the orbit map O : Subgroups(Sn) → P artn
such that O(G) is the space of orbits of the action of G induced by Sn on
{1, 2, . . . n}; i.e.

O(G) = { O(i) / i = 1, 2, . . . n } = {1, 2, . . . n}/G

where O(i) is the set of elements j for which there is a group element g ∈ G
such that g(i) = j; i.e O(i) = G · i.
On the other side, given a partition A = {A1, A2, . . . Al} we deﬁne the
group G(A) generated by all transpositions (i, j) for which there is some Ak
such that i, j ∈ Ak and i (cid:54)= j. By deﬁnition, is clear that

O(G(A)) = A

showing in particular that O is surjective. As an example, consider the par-
tition A = {{1, 2},{3, 4, 5},{6}}. Then, G(A) = (cid:104)(1, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)(cid:105).
However, the orbit space of the group (cid:104)(1, 2), (3, 4, 5)(cid:105) is also the partition A
and this group is a proper subgroup of G(A). In particular, the orbit map is
not injective. Nevertheless, restricted the subgroups generated by transposi-
tions, the orbit map become one to one. This is the content of the following
lemma:

3

Lemma 2.1. Consider a partition A ∈ P artn and a subgroup G < Sn such
that O(G) = A. Then G is a subgroup of G(A). Moreover, if G is generated
by transpositions, then G = G(A).

Proof: Consider g ∈ G < Sn and the partition A = {A1, A2, . . . Al}. g
can be written as a product of disjoint cycles and because O(G) = O(G(A)),
members of the same disjoint cycle belong to the same partition class; i.e. if

g = (i1

1 . . . i1

j1) . . . (ik

1 . . . ik
jk

)

then for each l there is a partition class Am such that

il
1, . . . il
jl
By deﬁnition of the group G(A),

∈ Am

(il

1, il

2), . . . (il

1, il
jl

) ∈ G(A)

and because every disjoint cycle can be written as

(il

1 . . . il
jl

) = (il

1, il
jl

) . . . (il

1, il

3)(il

1, il
2)

we conclude that g belongs to G(A). This way G < G(A).
Now assume that G is generated by transpositions. Because (i, k) =
(j, k)(i, j)(j, k) we have that (i, j), (j, k) ∈ G implies (i, k) ∈ G and the
following equivalence relation: i ∼ j are equivalent if i = j or (i, j) ∈ G. The
quotient space of this equivalence relation deﬁnes a partition

A(cid:48) = {1, 2, . . . n}/ ∼

Because G is generated by transpositions, we have A(cid:48) = O(G) = A and by
deﬁnition of G(A) and the equivalence relation, we have that G(A) < G.
Because G(A) > G, we conclude that G(A) = G.
(cid:3)

Corollary 2.2. Restricted to the subgroups generated by transpositions, the
orbit map is one to one.

Moreover, under the product

G1 · G2 = (cid:104)G1 ∪ G2(cid:105)

4

the orbit map restricted to the subgroups generated by transpositions is a
monoid isomorphism: O(G1·G2) = O(G1)·O(G2) and O({id}) = {{1},{2}, . . .{n}}.
Because the product of subgroups generated by transpositions is gener-
ated by transpositions, this product is well deﬁned. Observe that O(G1) is
ﬁner than O(G2) as partitions if and only if G1 ⊂ G2 as subgroups of Sn.
From now on we will identify partitions of {1, 2, . . . n} with subgroups
generated by transpositions of the permutation group Sn and call these ele-
ments connectivity states. Under this identiﬁcation we rewrite the deﬁnition
of the connectivity matrix as follows:

Deﬁnition 2.1. Relative to an ordering in P artn the connectivity matrix
A = (aij) is the matrix given by aij = 1 if Ai·Aj = Sn and aij = 0 otherwise.
Observe that every partition A is idempotent (A2 = A) and if A < B

then A · B = B.

Deﬁnition 2.2. The permutation group Sn acts by conjugation in P artn:

where A ∈ P artn and σ ∈ Sn.

σ(A) = σAσ−1

In particular we have conjugation classes in P artn; i.e.

the orbits in
P artn under the action of Sn: A ∼ B if there is a permutation σ such that
A = σ(B) = σBσ−1.
Lemma 2.3. Consider a permutation σ in Sn. Then σ : P artn → P artn is
a monoid morphism; i.e. σ({id}) = {id} and

σ(A · B) = σ(A) · σ(B)

It is clear that σ({id}) = {id}. Let’s show that σ is a monoid
morphism. Observe that σ(A · B) contains σ(A) and σ(B) so, by deﬁnition,

Proof:

σ(A · B) ⊃ σ(A) · σ(B)

See also that, σ−1(σ(A) · σ(B)) contains A and B so, by deﬁnition,

Acting by σ we get

A · B ⊂ σ−1(σ(A) · σ(B))

σ(A · B) ⊂ σ(A) · σ(B)

5

(cid:3)
Because P artn is a commutative monoid, the Q-vector space V generated
by P artn introduced before is actually an associative and commutative Q-
algebra with unit. We call this algebra the algebra of partitions. The monoid
morphism σ extends linearly to a unital algebra endomorphism where σ is a
permutation.

3. The determinant formula

3.1. Introduction

This section is devoted to the calculation of the connectivity matrix de-
terminant and to show in particular that this matrix is invertible. In general
terms, the proof goes in three steps:

1. Gauss elimination: Through elementary row operations, for each n we
develop a Gauss elimination method such that the connectivity matrix
becomes lower triangular.

2. Connectivity numbers and reliability polynomial: Identify the resulting
diagonal elements, called connectivity numbers, with the coeﬃcient of
the higher order term of certain reliability polynomials.

3. Connectivity numbers calculation: Under these identiﬁcation, calculate

the diagonal elements.

3.2. Step one: Gauss elimination

To develop a Gauss elimination on the connectivity matrix, we must
develop a systematic method to detect whether the entries of the matrix
are zero or one. After a careful analysis, one notice that under particular
orderings of the P artn basis (these will be called coherent orderings later),
some blocks related to the symmetry of the partitions appear. This suggests
that it is unavoidable the consideration of the partition’s symmetry in order
to develop a Gauss elimination on the connectivity matrix. The partition’s
symmetry is encoded in the partitions algebra introduced in the previous
section. Non trivial identities of this algebra will give the Gauss elimination
we are looking for.
Consider the linear operator π : V → V such that π(Sn) = Sn and for
every connectivity state A distinct from Sn,

π(A) =

(A − A · B)

(cid:89)

B / B≮A

6

Lemma 3.1. Consider a connectivity state A. The vector π(A) satisﬁes the
following properties:

1. B · π(A) = 0 ∀B / B ≮ A
2. C · π(A) = π(A) ∀C / C ≤ A
3. π(σ(A)) = σ(π(A)) ∀σ ∈ Sn
In particular, A · π(A) = π(A) and B · π(A) = 0 for every connectivity

state B distinct and conjugated to A.

Proof:

1. The algebra is commutative and P artn is a basis of idempotents; i.e.
A2 = A for every connectivity state A. In particular, there is a factor
of B · π(A) that is zero:

B · (A − A · B) = B · A − B2 · A = 0

2. Because of the fact that C · A = A if C ≤ A, every factor of π(A)

remains the same after multiplying by C:

C · (A − A · B) = C · A − C · A · B = A − A · B

3.

σ(π(A)) = σ

(σ(A) − σ(A) · σ(B))

(σ(A) − σ(A) · σ(B))

where we used in the last identity that σ is invertible.

(cid:3)
Deﬁnition 3.1. For each connectivity state A we deﬁne its connectivity
number as the coeﬃcient of Sn in the expansion of π(A) relative to the basis
P artn; i.e.

π(A) = A + . . . + αASn

7

Observe that, by the third item of Lemma 3.1, the connectivity number

is invariant under conjugation:

for every permutation σ.

αA = ασ(A)

Deﬁnition 3.2. An ordering of the basis P artn will be called coherent if it
satisﬁes

Ai < Aj ⇒ i < j

We argue that a coherent ordering always exist in the following way:
Consider the Hasse diagram (partial ordering diagram) of connectivity states
in P artn. Because conjugated states necessary belong to the same level of
the Hasse diagram, we can order P artn in the following way: We order some
conjugation class Oi of the ﬁrst level, then we order some other conjugation
class Oj of the same level and we continue the process until we have order
all the conjugation classes of the ﬁrst level. After that, we order the second
level in the same way as we did in the ﬁrst and so on until we have order all
the partitions. The previous argument is formalized in the next lemma:

Lemma 3.2. The partial ordering on P artn induces a partial ordering on
the conjugation classes.

i ∈ Oi and Aj, A(cid:48)

j ∈ Oj such that Ai < Aj and A(cid:48)

Proof: Deﬁne the following partial order on the conjugation classes: Oi <
Oj if there is Ai ∈ Oi and Aj ∈ Oj such that Ai < Aj. This partial
order relation is well deﬁned because of the following fact: Suppose there are
Ai, A(cid:48)
j. There are
permutations σ, η ∈ Sn such that A(cid:48)
j = η(Aj) and we have
Ai < Aj = η−1(A(cid:48)

i) = η−1σ(Ai)
We conclude that η−1σ = id and Ai = Aj which is absurd.

i = σ(Ai) and A(cid:48)
j) < η−1(A(cid:48)

i > A(cid:48)

(cid:3)

As an example consider the n = 4 case. The conjugation classes are:

O1 = { 1234 }

O2 = { 12(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)34 , 13(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)24 , 23(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)14 , 1(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)23 4,(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)13 24,(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)12 34 }
O3 = {(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)14 (cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)23 ,(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)13 (cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)24 ,(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)12 (cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)34 }
O4 = { 1(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)234 , 2(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)134 , 3(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)124 ,(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)123 4 }
O5 = {(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)

Figure 4: Hasse diagram of conjugation classes P art4

Figure 4 shows the Hasse diagram of the induced partial ordering on the
conjugation classes of P art4 described in the previous lemma. Is clear then
that the following is a coherent order of P art4 (we use the standard linear
algebra abuse of set notation concerning ordered basis):
P art4 = O1 ∪ O2 ∪ O3 ∪ O4 ∪ O5

Observe that, once we have order the basis P artn in a coherent way, the
operator π is the Gauss elimination we were looking for. In fact, π(A) =
A + . . . + αASn are the elementary operations of adding multiples of rows
B > A to the row A. Because of deﬁnition 2.1: aij = 1 if and only if
Ai · Aj = Sn and aij = 0 otherwise, we conclude that after the elementary
operations described by π(Ai) on the i-th row, the resulting entries a(cid:48)
ij equals
the coeﬃcient of Sn in the expansion of π(Ai) · Aj. By Lemma 3.1 we have
that a(cid:48)
ij = 0 if j > i. We conclude that performing the
elementary row operations π(Ai) on the row i-th row on every row of the
matrix, the resulting matrix is lower triangular.

ii = αAi and a(cid:48)

As an example consider the n = 3 case. The Hasse diagram of P art3 is

shown in Figure 5 and is clear that a coherent order on the basis P art3 is

P art3 = {123, 1(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)23 ,(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)13 2,(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)12 3,(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)123}

The linear operator π : V → V reads as follows:

(the entries of the bottom row of the B matrix).

Proposition 3.3. The determinant of the connectivity matrix A is

Proof: Choose a coherent order in the basis P artn and consider the con-

3.3. Step two: Connectivity numbers and reliability polynomial

Although the connectivity matrix was motivated from a reliability prob-
lem, it is very interesting that the connectivity matrix determinant turns
out to be a reliability calculation; i.e. The combinatorics of the connectivity
numbers is encoded in the combinatorics of a reliability polynomial.

Deﬁnition 3.3. Denote by Kn the graph with n nodes and one edge joining
every pair of nodes. Denote by KA
n the resulting graph from the identiﬁcation
of the nodes {1, 2, . . . n} in Kn by the classes of the partition A.
Lemma 3.4. Consider a partition A. Then,

R(KA

n ) = (−1)gαA pg + . . .

where αA is the connectivity number of the partition A and the dots denote
terms of lower degree of the reliability polynomial.

Proof: We claim that

π(A) = A ·

 (cid:89)

τ transp. / (cid:104)τ(cid:105)≮A



(e − (cid:104)τ(cid:105))

In eﬀect, consider a connectivity state B such that B ≮ A. There is a
transposition τ in B not belonging to A. Because A ⊂ A·B and (cid:104)τ(cid:105) ⊂ A·B
we have that A · (cid:104)τ(cid:105) ⊂ A · B so

A · B · (A − A · (cid:104)τ(cid:105)) = A · B − A · B = 0

This implies that

A · B ·

 = 0

(A − A · (cid:104)τ(cid:105))

 (cid:89)

τ transp. / (cid:104)τ(cid:105)≮A

12

and we conclude that the factors (A − A · B) such that B ≮ A do not
contribute in the original deﬁnition of π; i.e. Considering the transpositions
not contained in A is enough. This way we have the following expression:
π(A):

 (cid:89)



(e − (cid:104)τ(cid:105))

(cid:89)

π(A) =

(A − A · (cid:104)τ(cid:105)) = A ·

τ transp. / (cid:104)τ(cid:105)≮A

τ transp. / (cid:104)τ(cid:105)≮A

which proves the claim. In particular, the last expression implies that

αA = C0 − C1 + C2 − C3 + . . .

where Ci is the number of subsets F with cardinality i of the set of transpo-
sitions {τ transp. / (cid:104)τ(cid:105) ≮ A} such that (cid:104)F(cid:105) · A = Sn.

Identifying the transposition (ij) with the edge joining the nodes i and j
of Kn, it is clear that Ci is the pathsets number (operational states number)
of KA

n with just i operational edges. This way we have that

R(KA

n ) = C0(1 − p)g + C1p(1 − p)g−1 + C2p2(1 − p)g−2 + . . .

= (−1)g(C0 − C1 + C2 − C3 + . . .)pg + . . .
= (−1)gαA pg + . . .

where the dots denote terms of lower degree.

(cid:3)
Figure 6 shows an example in the n = 3 case (irrelevant edges were not

drawn).

3.4. Step three: Connectivity numbers calculation

This section is devoted to calculation of the highest degree term coeﬃcient
of the reliability polynomial of the graph KA
n . We assume the reader is aware
of the simple factorization theorem ([Mo],[SC],[Co], [Sh]). Although it is not
the main reference, it can also be found in the preliminaries of the previous
ﬁrst part paper [BR].

Let G be a graph and consider its reliability polynomial R(G). Denote
by mgr(R(G)) the term of R(G) whose degree equals the edge number of
G. Observe that if G has an irrelevant edge, then mgr(R(G)) = 0 and in
case mgr(R(G)) is non zero, then this term equals the highest degree term of
the polynomial. The following trick will be extremely useful in the following
calculations.

13

Figure 6: Step 2 of the proof

Lemma 3.5. Consider a graph G with k edges between a pair of distinct
nodes i and j of G. Consider the resulting graph ˜G by deleting k − 1 edges
between the nodes i and j of G. Then,

mgr(R(G)) = (−p)k−1 mgr

R( ˜G)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

Proof: The result is clear for k = 1. Suppose there are k > 1 edges
between the nodes i and j of G and that the result holds for an amount less
than or equal to k − 1 of them. Consider an edge a between the nodes i and
j. A simple factorization on the edge a gives

R(G) = p R(G · a) + (1 − p)R(G − a)

where G · a is the resulting graph by the contraction of a and G − a is the
resulting graph by deleting a. Observe that the edge number of G · a and
G − a is the edge number of G minus one and because k > 1, G · a has
irrelevant edges. This way,

mgr(R(G)) = (−p) mgr(R(G − a))

By the inductive hypothesis, we get the result.

(cid:3)
The following is a well known corollary of Gilbert’s formula [Gi],[Co] but

we use our method to arrive at the same result.

Lemma 3.6. The reliability polynomial of Kn is

R(Kn) = ±(n − 1)! pg + . . .

14

Figure 7: Relation between the graphs Kn+1, Kn and Kn−1

where the highest degree of the expression g equals the edge number of Kn:

(cid:19)

g =

(cid:18) n

Proof:

In this proof we will make an abuse of notation identifying the

reliability polynomial with its graph. We claim that

mgr(Kn+1) = (−1)n+1n mgr(Kn) pn

Because K2 = p and K1 = 1 we have the result for the n = 1 case. Suppose
the claim is true for every natural number less than or equal to n.

The Figure 7 shows the relation between the graphs Kn+1, Kn and Kn−1.
By a simple factorization on the edge joining the nodes n and n + 1 of the
graph Kn+1 and the above lemma we have that

Kn+1 = p(−p)n−1 Kn + . . . + (1 − p) Hn+1

where the dots denote terms whose degree is less than the edge number of
Kn+1 and the graph Hn+1 results from deleting the edge joining the nodes n
and n + 1 of the graph Kn+1, see Figure 8.

By the inductive hypothesis,

mgr(Kn) = (−1)n(n − 1) mgr(Kn−1) pn−1

and the fact that the relation between the graphs Kn and Kn−1 is the same
as the one between Hn+1 and Kn (both relations are the one point extension
from the graph Kn−1, see Figures 7 and 8), we have the following relation

mgr(Hn+1) = (−1)n(n − 1) mgr(Kn) pn−1

Figure 8: The graph Hn+1

Then, we have that
Kn+1 = p(−p)n−1 Kn+. . .+(1−p)(−1)n(n−1) Kn pn−1+. . . = (−1)n+1n Kn pn+. . .

where the dots denote terms whose degree is less than the edge number of
Kn+1. We conclude that

mgr(Kn+1) = (−1)n+1n mgr(Kn) pn

which proves the claim. This recursive relation shows that mgr(Kn) is non
zero so it equals the highest degree term of the reliability polynomial for Kn:

Kn = (−1)n+(n−1)+...2(n − 1)!p(n−1)+...1 + . . .

(cid:3)
and this concludes the lemma.
Lemma 3.7. Consider a partition A with m classes: A = {a1, a2, . . . am}.
Then, the reliability polynomial of KA

n is:

R(KA

n ) = ±(m − 1)! pg + . . .

where the highest degree g of the expression equals edge number of KA
taken out the irrelevant edges:

(cid:88)

i(cid:54)=j

g =

((cid:93)ai) ((cid:93)aj)

Proof: We will make the same abuse we did in the proof before identifying
the reliability polynomial with its graph and we also will identify the class
ai with its cardinality (cid:93)ai for notational convenience. The graph KA
n has m
nodes (these are the m classes of A),
respectively and aiaj edges joining the nodes i and j.

Consider the graph ¯KA

n resulting from deleting all the irrelevant edges of
the graph KA
n have the same reliability polynomial.
By the Lemma 3.5 we have the following relation between the graphs ¯KA

and Km:

and this concludes the proof.

(cid:3)
This concludes the third step of the proof. We have ﬁnally proved the

determinant formula:

Proposition 3.8. The determinant of the connectivity matrix A is:

det(A) = ± (cid:89)

A∈P artn

(mA − 1)!

where mA is the number of classes in the partition A. In particular, A is
invertible.

As an example, consider the n = 4 case. Recall the partitions conjugation

classes are:

O1 = { 1234 }

O2 = { 12(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)34 , 13(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)24 , 23(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)14 , 1(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)23 4,(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)13 24,(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)12 34 }
O3 = {(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)14 (cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)23 ,(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)13 (cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)24 ,(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)12 (cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)34 }
O4 = { 1(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)234 , 2(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)134 , 3(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)124 ,(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)123 4 }
O5 = {(cid:122)(cid:125)(cid:124)(cid:123)

1234 }

then we have that mOi equals 4, 3, 2, 2, 1 and the partitions conjugation
classes cardinalities are 1, 6, 3, 4, 1 respectively. By the above proposition
the determinant of the connectivity matrix is:

det(A) = ±(4 − 1)! 1(3 − 1)! 6(2 − 1)! 3(2 − 1)! 4(1 − 1)! 1 = ±384
