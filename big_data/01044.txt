Photonic lattices provide an excellent platform for simulating conventional topological systems,
and they can also be explored for the study of novel topological phases. However, a direct mea-
surement of bulk topological invariants remains a great challenge. Here we study topological fea-
tures of generalized commensurate Aubry-Andr´e-Harper (AAH) photonic lattices and construct a
topological phase diagram by calculating all bulk Chern numbers, and then explore the bulk-edge
correspondence by analyzing the topological edge states and their winding numbers. In contrast to
incommensurate AAH models, we ﬁnd that diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal commensurate AAH models
are not topologically equivalent. In particular, nontrivial topological phases with large Chern num-
bers and topological phase transitions are possible. By implementing Thouless pumping of light in
photonic lattices, we propose a simple scheme to measure the bulk Chern numbers.

Introduction. — Photonic systems represent a promis-
ing platform for testing quantum principles and imple-
menting quantum simulations [1, 2]. The main advan-
tages of photonic systems stem from: (i) easily prepar-
ing and detecting states, (ii) manipulating dispersion of
light by photonic structures, (iii) directly visualizing dy-
namics in space without decoherence, and (iv) exploring
dynamics regime exceeding original systems. Photonic
toolbox has been used to mimic various exotic quantum
phenomena, such as, quantum chemistry [3, 4], Bloch-
Zener dynamics [5–7], Anderson localization [8, 9], and
dynamics localization [10, 11]. Recently, photonic sys-
tems have been used to simulate conventional topological
systems and explore new topological phases [12–19]. The
integer quantum Hall systems have been simulated by
magneto-optical photonic crystals and coupled ring res-
onators [20–22]. It has been found that topological edge
states of light will propagate along the boundary [21, 23]
in the presence of internal and external disorder.

Modulating photonic lattices [24], one may mimic
Aubry-Andr´e-Harper (AAH) models [24–27], which are
equivalent to two-dimensional integer quantum Hall sys-
tems [25, 26].
In particular, strong hopping modula-
tion which is unlikely to be accessible in electronic sys-
tems, can be realized in photonic systems. For incom-
mensurate systems, regardless of whether the quasiperi-
odic modulation is applied to on-site potential or oﬀ-site
hopping, their topological equivalence has been found in
theory [27]. For commensurate systems, the topological
zero-energy modes have been discovered in the gapless
regime [28]. Therefore, the important questions are: Are
diﬀerent commensurate AAH models topological equiva-
lent? and Can we observe any topological phase transi-
tions in the commensurate AAH models?

By employing the bulk-edge correspondence, one may
explore topological phases by probing edge states or edge

topological invariants [29–32]. In recent years, in addi-
tion to observing edge states and their adiabatic pump-
ing [24], the edge topological invariant has also been
measured [29, 30]. However, direct measurement of the
bulk topological invariants such as Chern number is still
a great challenge in photonic systems. Due to the ab-
sence of any exclusion principle for photons, measuring
bulk topological invariants need a complex procedure of
sweeping the wavefunction over through the Brillouin
zone [33, 34]. That is, one has to know detailed infor-
mation about initial states of the occupied bulk band. It
has been proposed that the Thouless pumping is an al-
ternative method for measuring bulk topological invari-
ants [35]. Recently, the topological Thouless pumping of
ultracold atoms in optical superlattices has been reported
in experiments [36, 37]. Thus, we wonder if the Thouless
pumping of light can be employed to explore nontrivial
topological phases in photonic lattices?

In this Letter, we study topological features of gener-
alized commensurate AAH photonic lattices. By varying
the hopping amplitude and on-site potential, we discover
the topological phase diagram characterized by diﬀer-
ent Chern numbers. Interestingly, nontrivial topological
phases with large Chern numbers and topological phase
transitions appear when the hopping modulation is suﬃ-
ciently strong. This means that diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal
commensurate AAH models may have diﬀerent topologi-
cal invariants. To measure Chern numbers, in addition to
the transverse modulations along the lattice direction, we
propose to apply periodic longitudinal modulations along
the propagation direction for inducing Thouless pumping
of light along the transverse direction. Therefore, in the
adiabatic limit, the Chern number of the occupied band
can be determined by measuring the mean transverse po-
sition shift of light in one longitudinal modulation period.
Model. — We consider a generalized 1D commensu-

with the cosine-modulated on-site potential Vj =
λd cos(2πβj +ky +δφ) and the cosine-modulated nearest-
neighbouring hopping Jj,j+1 = −J + λod cos(2πβj + ky),
where the rational parameter β = p/q (p and q are co-
prime numbers). Here, N = qL is the total number of
lattice sites, j denotes the lattice index, cj and c†
j are re-
spectively annihilation and creation operators for the j-
th site. The oﬀ-diagonal modulations λod cos(2πβj + ky)
are described by the amplitude λod, the frequency β
and the phase ky. The diagonal modulations Vj =
λd cos(2πβj + ky + δφ) are described by the amplitude
λd, the frequency β and the phase ky + δφ. Here δφ is
the relative phase between the diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal
modulations. In the cases of λod = 0 and λd = 0, the
generalized AAH model is reduced to the diagonal and
oﬀ-diagonal AAH models, respectively. Our AAH-type
model with the tunable parameter ky can be realized
by 1D photonic waveguide arrays, see Fig. 1. Since the
on-site potentials are determined by the refractive in-
dices and the inter-waveguide coupling drops exponen-
tially with the inter-waveguide separation, the diagonal
and oﬀ-diagonal modulations can be realized by control-
ling the refractive indices and the inter-waveguide sepa-
ration, respectively.

L ˆHkx with the good quantum number kx = 2πl/(qL)
for integers l = {1, 2,··· , L}. Similar to other 1D sys-
tems [38, 39], the tunable parameter ky provides an-
other hidden dimension, thus the decoupled blocks of our
Hamiltonian are given as

Thus, the system becomes an eﬀective 2D system and it
may have nontrivial Chern numbers over the Brillouin-
like zone (−π/q < kx ≤ π/q, 0 < ky ≤ 2π).

(such as β = p/q = 1/3) and δφ = 0. For the oﬀ-diagonal
AAH model of rational parameter β = 1/(2q), the zero-
energy edge modes appear in the gapless regime [28], but
their Chern numbers are not well deﬁned.

By using a manifestly gauge-invariant description [40],
we numerically calculate the Chern numbers in the dis-
cretized Brillouin-like zone. Given β = 1/3, we show
the topological phase diagram in the parametric plane of
(λod, λd), see Fig. 2. In the absence of hopping modu-
lation (λod = 0), the system becomes a diagonal AAH
model, which does not show topological phase transition
for a given β [41]. For weak hopping modulations, sim-
ilar to the incommensurate systems [27], the topological

phase remains the same Chern numbers because the band
gaps remain open.

two energy gaps as a function of the relative hopping modu-

the ﬁrst and second gaps, respectively. (b) Energy bands for
λod/J = 1. The corresponding Chern numbers for the three

gaps close at the same point and there is no well deﬁnition
for the Chern number.
(d) Energy bands for λod/J = 10.
The corresponding Chern numbers for the three bands are
(2, −4, 2).

Diﬀerent from the incommensurate systems [27], topo-
logical phase transitions appear when the hopping mod-
ulation is suﬃciently strong. In the absence of diagonal
modulation (λd = 0), the system is an oﬀ-diagonal AAH
model with chiral symmetry [42]. As topological phase
transitions associate with band gap closure, we calculate
the energy gaps as a function of the relative modulation
amplitude λod/J, see Fig. 3 (a). The energy gap between
the n-th and (n + 1)-th bands is deﬁned as

δEn = min

kx,ky(cid:0)En+1,kx,ky − En,kx,ky(cid:1) .

(4)

Due to the chiral symmetry, the two energy gaps for
the purely oﬀ-diagonal AAH model are the same. By
solving a simple cube equation (see Appendix [43]), we
analytically determine the transition point λod/J = 4,
where the two energy gaps simultaneously close. How-
ever, the chiral symmetry is broken and the transition
point is split into two points even when a weak on-site
potential modulation is applied (see Appendix [43]). Ac-
companying with the topological phase transition, the en-
ergy bands undergo gap open-close-open transition, see

3

Fig. 3 (b)-(d). If the hopping modulation is suﬃciently
strong, λod/J > 4, a novel topological phase with large
Chern numbers (−2, 4,−2) appears. Through the transi-
tion point, the Chern numbers change from (1,−2, 1) to
(−2, 4,−2), where not only the values of Chern numbers
become doubled but also their signs change. This means
that the particle pumping along the lattice direction be-
comes more fast and the propagation direction change
opposite. In the region of λod/J > 4, the energy gaps
linearly increase with λod/J, which may facilitate the
detection of large Chern numbers in experiments. The
novel topological phases with large Chern numbers are
not limited to the system of β = 1/3, but generally exist
in systems of rational β and odd q (see Appendix [43]).

FIG. 4. (color online) Energy spectrum for the oﬀ-diagonal
AAH model with open boundary condition and diﬀerent val-
ues of λod/J =: (a) 1 and (b) 10. The blue dot-dashed (red
solid) lines in the gaps stand for the edge modes localized at
the left (right) edge. Here the lattice size is chosen as 89 sites.

Based upon the bulk-edge correspondence [44, 45], the
topological bulk states under periodic boundary condi-
tion correspond to the topological edge states under open
boundary condition, and the bulk-state Chern number
equals the edge-state winding number diﬀerence between
the neighboring gaps. By implementing exact diago-
nalization, we obtain the energy spectrum for the oﬀ-
diagonal AAH model with open boundary condition, see
Fig. 4 (a) for λod/J = 1 and (b) for λod/J = 10. Due
to the chiral symmetry, these energy spectra are mirror
symmetric about zero energy. For λod/J = 1, there are
two edge modes with one at the left edge and the other at
the right edge. While for λod/J = 10, there are four edge
modes with two at the left edge and the other two at the
right edge. This means that the corresponding winding
numbers (I1, I2) are (1,−1) for λod/J = 1 and (−2, 2)
for λod/J = 10. As I0 = 0 and I3 = 0, the corresponding
Chern numbers (C1 = I1 − I0, C2 = I2 − I1, C3 = I3 − I2)
respectively equal (1,−2, 1) and (−2, 4, 2), which are
consistent with our numerical results shown in Fig. 2.
Alternatively, the Chern numbers can also be deduced

from the winding numbers of the reﬂection coeﬃcient
phase [32].

Measuring Chern numbers via Thouless pumping. —
Without losing any generality, we propose to measure
the Chern numbers of the oﬀ-diagonal AAH model via
Thouless pumping of light [35–37]. To implement Thou-
less pumping in photonic waveguide arrays, in addition
to the periodic modulation of inter-waveguide distances
along the lattice direction, one has also to modulate the
hopping adiabatically and periodically along the propa-
gation direction, see Fig. 1 (a). The light propagation
is governed by the Schr¨odinger equation with the lon-
gitudinal propagation distance z acting the role of the
evolution time,

i∂zϕj = [−J + λod cos (2πj/3 + ky(z))] ϕj+1

+ [−J + λod cos (2π(j − 1)/3 + ky(z))] ϕj−1.(5)
Here, ϕj is the normalized amplitude of the transverse
light ﬁeld in the j-th waveguide and the parameter ky
varies along the propagation direction. In our simulation,
the parameters are chosen as β = 1/3 and λod/J = 1 or
10, and the initial state is prepared as the maximally lo-
calized Wannier state w(j) of the ﬁrst band [46, 47]. To
realize adiabatic pumping, ky(z) has to be tuned slowly
to suppress the Landau-Zener (LZ) transition between
diﬀerent bands. We design ky(z) varying according to
ky(z + dz) = ky(z) + v(z)dz with ky(0) = 0, where v(z) is
the instantaneous velocity to be determined below. Ac-
cording to the LZ formula [48], the ratio of LZ transi-
tion from the ﬁrst band to the second band is approx-

In a continuous pumping process,

imately given as Γ ∼ exp(cid:2)−2π(δE1)2/v(cid:3). To minimize
Γ, one may set v(z) = gδE1(ky(z)) with the constant
g ≪ δE1(ky) for all ky ∈ [0, 2π].
the hopping
strengths Jj,j+1 are periodic along both transverse and
longitudinal directions.
In one pumping cycle, ky in-
creases from 0 to 2π with z increasing from 0 to Z, the
Chern number C can be determined by the mean trans-
verse position shift of the light from the relation

∆P = Xj
= qC.

j|hϕj (Z)|ϕj(Z)i|2 −Xj

j|hϕj (0)|ϕj(0)i|2

(6)

For λod/J = 1 and 10, we calculate the absolute val-
ues of ∆P/q versus the lattice size N , see Fig. 5 (a).
As N increases, |∆P/q| tend to 1 and 2 for λod/J = 1
and 10, respectively. Given λod/J = 1, in a ﬁnite-size
system of 30 sites, |∆P/q| reaches 0.99, which is very
close to 1 – the ideal limit for the inﬁnite-size system.
For the systems of 210 sites, we show how their relative
mean transverse position shifts ∆P/q change with ky in
one pumping cycle in Fig. 5 (b). Such a lattice size is
within the capability of current femtosecond-laser writ-
ten techniques [49]. For λod/J = 1 and 10, the mean
transverse positions are respectively shifted 1.00 unit cell

4

along right and 1.98 unit cells along left, see Fig. 5 (b).
From the relation (6), the Chern numbers are then di-
rectly determined as 1.00 and -1.98, which are almost as
same as the true values 1 and -2. This means that the
Thouless pumping of light provides another hallmark of
the topological phases in our generalized 1D AAH model.
Similarly, one can also determine the Chern numbers for
excited bands by inputting maximally localized Wannier
states of the corresponding excited bands.

Summary and discussion. — Finding large Chern
numbers experimentally is a signiﬁcant goal in explor-
ing novel topological phases [50, 51]. Generally speaking,
large Chern numbers are introduced by weak tunneling
in high-order perturbation expansion [2]. Moreover, be-
cause of a narrow energy gap, large Chern numbers are
very hard to measure in experiments. We believe that
our ﬁndings of large Chern numbers in photonic lattices
and the suggestion of their measurement via Thouless
pumping oﬀer an inspiration for experimental studies of
novel topological phases.

Beyond the study of linear properties of photonic lat-
tices, it is important to introduce nonlinear response into
these systems to understand an interplay between nonlin-
earity and topology. In contrast to linear systems, non-
linear systems have no counterparts in two-dimensional
Harper-Hofstadter models.
It is still unknown how to
characterize the topological phases in nonlinear systems.
We believe that the Thouless pumping may provide a so-

lution to extend the deﬁnition of topological invariants
from linear to nonlinear systems.

In summary, we have predicted topological phase tran-
sitions in the generalized AAH photonic lattices and
have demonstrated a possibility to measure directly their
Chern numbers via Thouless pumping of light. For
weak hopping modulations, the oﬀ-diagonal commensu-
rate AAH model has been shown to be topologically
equivalent to its diagonal counterpart. Strengthening the
hopping modulation, the energy bands undergo a gap clo-
sure with topological phase transitions, and novel topo-
logical phases with large Chern numbers appear when
the hopping modulation is suﬃciently strong. Taking
the oﬀ-diagonal AAH model with β = 1/3 as an exam-
ple, we have analyzed the topological phase transitions at
λod/J = ±4. The photonic topological phase transitions
can be veriﬁed by either topological edge or bulk invari-
ants. To clarify the bulk-edge correspondence, in addi-
tion to the calculation of the bulk-state Chern numbers,
we have analyzed the topological edge states and their
winding numbers, and have suggested a simple scheme
to measure directly the bulk Chern numbers by means of
the Thouless pumping of light.

Analytical derivation of transition points for the

oﬀ-diagonal AAH model with β = 1/3

Given β = 1/3, from Hamiltonian (2), the decoupled
blocks of the oﬀ-diagonal AAH Hamiltonian becomes a
3× 3 matrix and their eigenvalues are determined by the
determinant problem,

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

−ε A B
A∗ −ε C
B∗ C ∗ −ε

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(7)

where

A = [−J + λod cos(−2π/3 + ky)] e−ikx,
B = [−J + λod cos(2π/3 + ky)] eikx ,
C = [−J + λod cos(ky)] e−ikx ,

(8)

and −π/3 ≤ kx ≤ π/3 and 0 ≤ ky ≤ 2π. The above
eigenvalue problem can be transformed to solve the sim-
ple cube equation,

−ε3+(AA∗ + BB∗ + CC ∗) ε+AB∗C+A∗BC ∗ = 0. (9)
Substitute Eq. (8) into Eq. (9), one can obtain

od = 0.(10)

For convenience, we set J = 1 and denote x = λod and
y = cos3(ky) − 3/4 cos(ky) with |y| 6 1/4. Obviously,
y = +1/4 and −1/4 when ky = {0, 2π/3, 4π/3, 2π} and
ky = {π/3, π, 5π/3}, respectively.

It is known that topological phase transitions asso-
ciate with energy gap closure (i.e. energy band degen-
eracy). Thus the transition points can be obtained from
the energy band degeneracy condition. According to Car-
dano’s cubic formula, the eigenvalue equation has three
real roots and two of them are degenerated when

∆ = −(1 +

x2)3 + cos2(3kx)(cid:18)yx3 +

x2 − 1(cid:19)2

= 0.

(11)
Thus, the transition point can be given by analyzing the
roots of the Carano’s cubic equation.

We know, if there is no hopping modulation (x = 0),
the system is just a simple tight-binding system whose
energy bands is given as

En = −2 cos(cid:18) 2πn

3

+ kx(cid:19) ,

(12)

where n = {1, 2, 3} is the band index. The three energy
bands come from folding the single band into the reduced
Brillouin zone [−π/3, π/3]. The degeneracy between n1-
th and n2-th bands occurs when

2πn1

3

+ kx = −(cid:18) 2πn2

3

+ kx(cid:19) + 2πm,

(13)

where 1 ≤ n1 < n2 ≤ 3 and m is an integer. Obviously,
(14)

(−(n1 + n2) + 3m) ∈ h−

3i .

kx =

,

Because the number (−(n1 + n2) + 3m) is an integer, the
degenerate points can happen only at kx = {0,±π/3}.
Alternatively, the degenerate points can be obtained by
substituting x = 0 into Eq. (11),

cos2 (3kx) − 1 = 0.

(15)

When the hopping modulation is applied, i.e. x 6= 0,
the energy bands hybridize at the degenerate points to
give rise to the energy gap. However, the positions of
energy minimum and maximum of each band in the
kx direction do not change with λod. Therefore, for
nonzero x = λod, the energy-band degenerate points in
the (kx, ky) plane also satisfy the condition cos2(3kx) = 1
and the corresponding ∆ function reads as,

∆ = x2(cid:20)(cid:18)y2 −

yx3 −

(16)
Now, we analyze the part f (x, y) = (cid:0)y2 − 1
2 yx3 −
16 x2 − 2yx − 3. Since −1/4 6 y 6 1/4, the maximum of
f (x, y) 6 0 and f (x, y) = 0 if and only if ky = ±1/4. It
means that two of three real roots are degenerate if and
only if y = ±1/4. For y = 1/4, we have

8(cid:1) x4 + 3

f (x, y) = −

1
16

(x − 4)2(x + 1 + i√2)(x + 1 − i√2) = 0.

(17)

It is easy to ﬁnd that the transition point has x =
λod = 4 and the degenerate points in the (kx, ky) plane
are (kx; ky) = (0,±π/3; 0, 2π/3, 4π/3, 2π). Similarly, for
y = −1/4, we have

1
16

(x + 4)2(x− 1 + i√2)(x− 1− i√2) = 0, (18)
f (x) = −
and the corresponding transition point x = λod = −4 for
the degenerate points (kx; ky) = (0,±π/3; π/3, π, 5π/3).

Topological phase transitions in generalized AAH

models with β = 1/3

In oﬀ-diagonal AAH models, the energy spectra are
symmetric about zero energy due to the chiral symmetry.
However, when the diagonal modulation is turned on, the
chiral symmetry breaks down. Thus, the gaps between
neighboring energy bands close and open one by one as
the oﬀ-diagonal modulation strength increases. Conse-
quently, an intermediate topological phase spans from the
transition point for the oﬀ-diagonal AAH model, see the
phase diagram (Fig. 2 in the Letter). We calculate the
ﬁrst and second energy gaps as a function of the hopping
modulation strength for λd/J = 2, see Fig. 6 (a). In the
region of 0 < λod/J < 2.854, the energy band gaps keep
open and the Chern numbers are C(1,−2, 1), see Fig. 6
(b). At the point of λod/J = 2.854, the second energy
gap closes and the Chern numbers of the second and third
bands are not well deﬁned, while the Chern number of
the ﬁrst band keeps the same, see Fig. 6 (c). In the region
of 2.854 < λod/J < 5.698, the energy gap between the
second and third bands reopens and the Chern numbers
are changed to C(1, 1,−2), see Fig. 6 (d). At the point of
λod/J = 5.698, the ﬁrst energy gap closes and the Chern
numbers of the ﬁrst and second bands are not well de-
ﬁned, while the Chern number of the third band keeps the
same, see Fig. 6 (e). In the region of 5.698 < λod/J < 12,
the gap between the second and third bands reopen and
the Chern numbers are C(−2, 4,−2), see Fig. 6 (f).

Topological phase transitions in general
commensurate oﬀ-diagonal AAH models

Due to the length limit, in the Letter, we only show
the topological phase transitions in oﬀ-diagonal AAH
models of β = 1/3. Actually, topological phase transi-
tions can take place in general commensurate oﬀ-diagonal
AAH models. Here, we show the Chern numbers for
systems with β = (1/5, 2/5, 1/7, 2/7, 3/7), see Ta-
ble. I. For each β, several topological phase transitions
take place. Taking the system of β = 1/5 as an exam-
ple, the Chern numbers for the ﬁve bands are respectively
(1, 1, −4, 1, 1) for 0 < λod/J < 1.410, (1, −4, 6, −4, 1)
for 1.410 < λod/J < 2.250 and (1, 1, −4, 1, 1) for

The ﬁrst and second energy gaps as a function of the hopping modulation strength λod/J. The blue dot-dashed (red solid) line
stands for the ﬁrst (second) energy gap. (b) Energy bands for λod/J = 1. The Chern numbers for the three bands are (1, −2, 1).
(c) Energy bands for λod/J = 2.854. The second and third bands touch at the degenerate points and their Chern numbers are
not well deﬁned. The Chern number for the ﬁrst band is 1. (d) Energy bands for λod/J = 4. The Chern numbers for the three
bands are (1, 1, −2). (d) Energy bands for λod/J = 5.698. The ﬁrst and second bands touch at the degenerate points and their
Chern numbers are not well deﬁned. The Chern number of the third band is -2. (b) Energy bands for λod/J = 10. The Chern
numbers for the three bands are (−2, 4, −2).

2.250 < λod/J < 5.0. It means that topological phase
transitions simultaneously happen in the second, third
and fourth bands when λod/J goes through the transi-
tion points 1.410 and 2.250. The second and third energy
gaps simultaneously close at the transition points.

Based upon our calculation for systems of diﬀerent β,
novel topological phases with large Chern numbers al-
ways exist and the topological phase transitions become
complicated as q increases. Only when the hopping mod-
ulation is suﬃciently weak, the oﬀ-diagonal and diagonal
AAH models have identical Chern numbers. The Chern
numbers in the weak hopping modulation regime can be

analytically obtained by perturbation theory [2]. Our
results convince us of the generic existence of topologi-
cal phase transitions in commensurate oﬀ-diagonal AAH
model with odd q.
