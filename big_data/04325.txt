Abstract: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) has been intensively studied
and widely employed for light
trapping and absorption enhancement.
In the mid-infrared and terahertz (THz) regime, graphene supports the
tunable SPR via manipulating its Fermi energy and enhances light-matter
interaction at the selective wavelength. In this paper, a pair of graphene
concentric rings has been proposed to introduce tunable dual-band light
trapping with good angle polarization tolerance and enhance the absorption
in the low light-absorbing efﬁciency materials nearby to more than one
order. Moreover, the design principle here could be set as a template to
achieve multi-band plasmonic absorption enhancement by introducing
more graphene concentric rings into each unit cell. This work not only
opens up new ways of employing graphene SPR, but also leads to practical
applications in high-performance simultaneous multi-color photodetection
with high efﬁciency and tunable spectral selectivity.

Introduction

In recent years, light absorption has attracted considerable attention due to its broad ap-
plication prospects in optoelectronic devices, such as photovoltaic cells[1], sensors[2], and
photodetections[3]. The surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) has been demonstrated to be one
of the most effective ways to enhance light-matter interaction, and a variety of noble metal
based plasmonic structures have been proposed to trap light and obtain the desired strong
absorption[4, 5, 6]. However, the spectral characteristics of these metal plasmonic structures
depend on the geometric parameters, and the operation wavelength and modulation depth will
be unchangeable once the structures are fabricated, therefore this kind of devices still suffer
from inﬂexibility in many practical applications.

Graphene, a monolayer atom-thick and two-dimensional carbon material, has become a
promising building block in the state of the art technology because of its fantastic mechan-
ical, thermal and electromagnetic properties[7, 8, 9]. In particular, the continuously tunable
surface conductivity of graphene via manipulating its Fermi energy by electrical gating or
chemical doping enables tunable optoelectronic devices[10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Moreover in the
mid-infrared and terahertz (THz) regime, graphene behaves like noble metals when coupling
with the incidence light and supports the SPR, therefore beneﬁt to light trapping and absorption
enhancement[15, 16, 17]. By combing with these two advantages, it is possible to make up the
above-mentioned disadvantages in traditional metal plasmonic structures.

Tunable single-[18], dual-[19] and multi-band[20] plasmonic absorption enhancement has
been realized and explained, and perfect absorption also achieved with graphene absorber
backed by a metal mirror[21, 22, 23]. However, most of the previous works have focused on the
absorption enhancement in graphene to save its poor absorptivity of 2.3%, and few attention
has been paid to the absorption enhancement in other low light-absorbing efﬁciency materi-
als with graphene SPR[24]. Actually, the graphene SPR can be employed the way in which
the metal SPR has been employed. In the research ﬁeld of photodetection, thin ﬁlm semicon-
ductors and two-dimension materials are often employed due to their easy integrity and high
efﬁciency[25, 26], but the low light-absorbing efﬁciency of these materials hinders the light
absorption and photocarrier generation. Here graphene SPR is a preferable alternative in the
mid-infrared and THz regime since it could not only provide the obligatory light trapping and
absorption enhancement like metal SPR [27, 28], but also exhibits the dynamic tunability which
is desirable in tunable photodetection applications.

To demonstrate this kind of use of graphene SPR, an integrated plasmonic device composed
of a pair of graphene concentric rings on the top of the low light-absorbing efﬁciency mate-
rials separated by an insulating layer has been proposed in this work. Systematic simulations
with the ﬁnite-difference time-domain method show that the structure exhibits both good an-

gle polarization tolerance and excellent absorption enhancement. The excitations of SPR in the
graphene concentric rings signiﬁcantly enhance the interaction between the incidence light and
the low light-absorbing efﬁciency materials at both dipole resonances, and the dual-band ab-
sorption enhancement can be conveniently modulated via manipulating the Fermi energy. In
addition, due to the fact that these two dipole resonances correspond respectively to the in-
ner and outer graphene rings, the design principle here could be set as a template to achieve
multi-band plasmonic absorption enhancement by introducing more graphene concentric rings
into each unit cell. Therefore, our proposed structure lays the foundation for practical appli-
cations in high-performance simultaneous multi-color photodetection with high efﬁciency and
tunable spectral selectivity, which meets the urgent need for the simultaneous multi-band signal
processing[29, 30, 31].

2. The geometric structure and numerical model

The top and cross-section views of our proposed structure are shown in Figure 1(a) and (b),
respectively. The unit cell is arranged in a periodic array with a lattice constant P = 300 nm
and composed of a pair of concentric rings on the top of the absorbing layer separated by a
insulating layer. R1 and R2 are the respective radius of the inner and the outer graphene rings
with the identical width W = 30 nm and the effective thickness tg = 1 nm. The thicknesses of
the insulating layer and the absorbing layer are ti = 20 nm and ta = 100 nm, and the substrate is
assumed to be semi-inﬁnite. Both the insulating layer and the substrate are considered as loss-
less dielectric with a real permittivity of e d = 1.96. Comparable with some typical materials
employed for photodetection in the mid-infrared and THz regime, the absorbing layer is mod-
eled as thin ﬁlm semiconductor through a complex permitivity of e a = e ′
= 10.9
and e ′′ is related to the attenuation coefﬁcient a = −(2p /l )Im(pe ′ + ie ′′) accounting for the
loss.

In the initial setup, the attenuation coefﬁcient of the absorbing layer a = −0.1 µm−1 and
the Fermi energy of graphene EF = 0.6 eV are considered and their inﬂuences will be analyzed
later. The numerical simulations are conducted using the ﬁnite-difference time-domain method
with the commercial software FDTD Solutions. The anti-symmetric and symmetric boundary
conditions are respectively employed in the x and y directions throughout the calculations ex-
cept when studying the angle polarization tolerance, and perfectly matched layers are utilized
in the z direction along the propagation of the incident plane wave.

3. Simulation results and discussions

For the above structure, a typical dual-band response to normal incidence light with the electric
ﬁeld paralleling to the x-direction is displayed in Figure 2. Both resonances exhibit transmission
suppression and absorption enhancement. For the resonance labelled Mode 1 at around 16
µm, the total absorption of this structure is A = 34.8% and the absorption in the absorbing
layer is A′ = 18.6%. And for the other resonance labelled Mode 2 at around 30 µm, the total
absorption is A = 32.2% and the absortion in the absorbing layer is A′ = 14.7%. Now that
the absorbing layer is set to 100 nm thick with the attenuation coefﬁcient a = −0.1 µm−1,
which corrsponds to a weak absorption of 2% in the impedance matched media, 9 and 7 times
absorption enhancement in the absorbing layer have been respectively realized within Mode 1
and 2.

It is not difﬁcult to believe the absorption enhancement should be ascribed to graphene SPR.
The localized collective electronic excitations strongly couple to and trap the incidence light
and enhance the absorption in the nearby materials. To better understand and make use of these
two absorption bands, the electric ﬁeld distributions at both resonances are plotted below.

Fig. 3: The simulated electric ﬁeld distributions (a)-(b) in the x-y plane (|Ez|) and (c)-(d) in
the x-z cross plane (|Ey|) at the dual-band resonance with the attenuation coefﬁcient a = −0.1
µm−1 and the Fermi energy of graphene EF = 0.6 eV.

As shown in Figure 3(a) and (b), the x-y plane electric ﬁeld distributions (|Ez|) at the two
bands show characteristic behaviors of the electric dipoles and are symmetric to the y-axis
due to the x-polarization of the incidence light. Meanwhile, the x-z cross plane electric ﬁeld
distributions (|Ey|) in Figure 3(c) and (d) clearly represent that the plasmon-induced strong
ﬁeld conﬁnements extend to the absorbing layer and enhance the light-matter interaction. More
importantly, the mutual couplings between the two rings are rather weak and the electric ﬁeld
concentrates in either inner (Mode 1) or outer (Mode 2) ring. Therefore, each absorption band
can be approximated to individual dipole response of the corresponding graphene ring.

On the other hand, it is supposed that the effective wavelength of the dipole response is

approximately equal to the circumference of the corresponding ring[10]

l e f f = 2p R,

and thus the resonance wavelength can be predicted from

l res = l e f f ne f f = 2p Rne f f ,

(4)

(5)

where ne f f is the effective refractive index of the ring waveguide. In Figure 4(a) and (b), an
inﬁnitely long graphene ribbon waveguide of the same width on the top of the light-absorbing
layer separated by the insulating layer is provided for the calculation of ne f f . Although there
exist some geometric differences between the ring and the ribbon waveguide, and the appear-
ance of one ring waveguide in the concentric ring unit cell might also affect ne f f of the other,

the calculated ne f f at EF = 0.6 eV and the consequent resonance wavelengths in the graphene
concentric rings still show a good agreement with the simulated dual-band response.

Furthermore, ne f f at other Fermi energies ranging from 0.4 eV - 1.2 eV are also plotted in
Figure 5. From the equation (5), the tunable ne f f via manipulating the graphene Fermi energy
leads to the tunable dipole resonance and sets the direct foundation of the wavelength-selective
absorption enhancement, which makes up the inﬂexibility in traditional metal plasmonic ab-
sorption enhancement.

As the only two lossy media within the integrated structure, there unavoidably exists a com-
petition of absorption between graphene and the absorbing layer nearby. The attenuation coef-

ﬁcient of the low light-absorbing efﬁciency material, initially set to a = −0.1 µm−1, plays a
dominant role in the distribution of light absorption. The total absorption A and the absorption
in the absorbing layer A′ are also simulated with different a
in Figure 6. When a = −0.05
µm−1, corresponding to a poor absorption of 1% in the impedance matched media, the total
absorptions increase to A = 37.8% for Mode 1 and A = 34.8% for Mode 2, and the absolute
absorptions in the absorbing layer are respectively A′ = 13.5% and A′ = 10.1% with more than
one order enhancement at both resonances due to the lower loss of the total structure. When
a = −0.2 µm−1, corresponding to about 4% absorption in the impedance matched media, the
total absorptions decrease to A = 30.6% for Mode 1 and A = 29.8% for Mode 2 while the
absorptions in the absorbing layer are A′ = 21.7% and A′ = 18.6%, in which case about ﬁve
times enhancement is achieved for each mode. It is also noteworthy that the dual-band absorp-
tion enhancement stays at nearly the same resonance wavelengths in that the variations in the
attenuation coefﬁcient a here are not big enough to bring about visible inﬂuences on ne f f .

Fig. 6: The simulated absorption A and the absorption in the absorbing layer A′ with the Fermi
energy of graphene EF = 0.6 eV and the attenuation coefﬁcient (a) a = −0.05 µm−1 and (b)
a = −0.2 µm−1.

To analyze the tunable property of the light trapping, the dual-band absorption in the ab-
sorbing layer with various Fermi energy of graphene has been simulated in Figure 7. When
the Fermi energy starting at 0.4 eV, the resonance wavelengths of Mode 1 and 2 are 19.8 µm
and 36.7 µm, and the absorptions are 12.2% and 9.8%, respectively. As EF increases to 0.8
eV, the dual-band shifts to 13.9 µm (Mode 1) and 25.8 µm (Mode 2), and absorptions of 23%
and 18.5% are simultaneously obtained. Furthermore with EF = 1.0 eV, more than one order
absorption enhancement is achieved with Mode 2 at 23.1 µm as well as with Mode 1 at 12.5

µm. Finally while EF comes to 1.2 eV, the resonance absorptions reach as high as 27.2% and
22.8% at 11.4 µm and 21 µm, respectively. It is found that ne f f of the graphene ring waveguide
varies with the Fermi energy and enables the dual-band graphene SPR to trap the incidence
light at the selective wavelengths in such a large range. On the other hand, the conductivity of
graphene increases with EF and thus graphene SPR becomes less lossy, which leads to more
absorption in the absorbing layer.

Considering the high symmetry of our proposed structure, the incidence angle and polar-
ization dependence of graphene SPR is expected to be weak. The light absorption properties
at various angle for both TE and TM conﬁgurations have been investigated. As illustrated in
Figuire 8(a) and (b), the dual-band absorption in the absorbing layer keeps nearly the same for
incidence angle up to 45 degree. On the other hand, the resonance wavelength is only deter-
mined by the radius and the Fermi energy of the corresponding graphene ring, indicated by
the equation (5), and does not depend on the incidence angle and polarization, which is also
reﬂected in the ﬁgures. Consequently, the good operation angle and polarization tolerance of
graphene concentric rings will beneﬁt the practical applications on light trapping and absorption
enhancement.

In the most recent years, two-dimensional materials have emerged as promising building
blocks in the state of the art optoelectronic devices among a very wide range of electromagnetic
spectrum[9]. Compared with the traditional photonic materials, two-dimensional materials ex-
hibit a lot of exceptional properties. The quantum conﬁnement in the direction perpendicular to
the two-dimensional plane leads to many novel optical and electronic properties[36, 37, 38, 39],
and the naturally passivated surfaces make them easy to integrate with photonic structures such
as waveguides[40, 41] and cavities[42, 43]. In addition to graphene, a variety of other two-
dimensional materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides have been employed in pho-
todetection and other optoelectronic applications [44, 45].Though possessing very high quan-
tum efﬁciency for light-matter interaction, the absorption of these two-dimensional materials
is insufﬁcient in practical devices due to the innate thinness. Therefore, integration with SPR
offers an effective solution for the absorption enhancement and further applications in pho-
todetection. As shown in Figure 9, the 100 nm thick absorbing layer is replaced with two-
dimensional material, which is modelled as a 1nm thick conductive ﬁlm with an optical con-
ductance G0 = 2.65 ×10−5 W −1, corresponding to an absorption of about 1% for a free standing
ﬁlm.

Similar to that in the traditional counterpart, the dual-band response is also found here. Figure
10 plots the dual-band absorption enhancement in the two-dimensional absorbing layer while

Fermi energy of graphene varies from 0.4 eV to 1.2 eV in step of 0.2 eV. When EF starting
at 0.4 eV, the resonance wavelengths of Mode 1 and 2 locate at 16.9 µm and 32.4 µm, and
the absorptions are 11.3% and 6.3%, respectively. When EF increases to 0.6 eV, more than
one order absorption enhancement is achieved with Mode 2 at 26.3 µm as well as with Mode
1 at 13.8 µm. And while EF comes to 1.2 eV, the resonance absorptions reach as high as
26.8% and 21.1% at 9.8 µm and 18.6 µm, respectively, and the enhancement factor over 20 is
simultaneously obtained at both resonances.

4. Conclusion

To conclude, dual-band light trapping and absorption enhancement have been numerically in-
vestigated in an integrated structure composed of a pair of graphene concentric rings on the
top of the absorbing layer separated by an insulating layer. It is found that the excitations of
localized collective electrons in graphene strongly couple to and trap the incidence light in the
near-ﬁeld, and signiﬁcantly enhance the absorption in the low light-absorbing efﬁciency mate-
rials (thin ﬁlm semiconductor and two-dimensional materials) to more than one order at both
resonances. Compared with the traditional noble metal plasmonic devices, the absorption en-
hancement here can be dynamically tuned via manipulating the Fermi energy of graphene in
such a large range, thus enables tunable photodetection and other optoelectronic applications
in the mid-infrared and THz regime. As an extension, our proposed structure leaves room for
introducing more graphene concentric rings to the unit cell to achieve multi-band absorption
enhancement, therefore lays the foundation for simultaneous photodetection at multiple wave-
lengths with high efﬁciency and tunable spectral selectivity.
