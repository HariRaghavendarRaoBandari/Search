Abstract

In this paper we suggest generalizations of elliptic integrable tops to matrix-valued
variables. Our consideration is based on R-matrix description which provides Lax pairs
in terms of quantum and classical R-matrices. First, we prove that for relativistic (and
non-relativistic) tops such Lax pairs with spectral parameter follow from the associative
Yang-Baxter equation and its degenerations. Then we proceed to matrix extensions of the
models and ﬁnd out that some additional constraints are required for their construction.
We describe a matrix version of Z2 reduced elliptic top and verify that the latter constraints
are fulﬁlled in this case. The construction of matrix extensions is naturally generalized to
the monodromy preserving equation. In this way we get matrix extensions of the Painlev´e
VI equation and its multidimensional analogues written in the form of non-autonomous
elliptic tops. Finally, it is mentioned that the matrix valued variables can be replaced by
elements of noncommutative associative algebra. In the end of the paper we also describe
special elliptic Gaudin models which can be considered as matrix extensions of the (Z2
reduced) elliptic top.

In this paper we describe a noncommutative generalization of integrable Euler-Arnold tops
related to the group SL(N, C). The simplest example of the latter is given by the Euler top:

˙S = [S, J(S)] ,

J(S) =

Xα=1

S =

Xα=1

σαSαJα ,

(1.1)

(1.2)

where σα are the Pauli matrices, ı = √−1, J1, J2, J3 - arbitrary constants (inverse components of

inertia tensor written in principle axes) and (S1, S2, S3) – the dynamical variables (components of
the angular momentum vector). The model is Hamiltonian. Its phase space is parameterized by
the Sα variables treated as coordinates on su∗(2) Lie coalgebra, where the Poisson-Lie structure
is deﬁned:

{Sα, Sβ} = εαβγSγ ,

H =

1

3

JαS2
α .

Xα=1

(1.3)

The Hamiltonian equations ˙Sα = {H, Sα} are equivalent to (1.1). In what follows we deal with
the complexiﬁed version of the Euler equation and its generalizations, i.e. Sα ∈ C, Jα ∈ C and
su∗(2) is replaced by sl∗(2, C).

The Euler-Arnold generalizations of (1.1) correspond to higher rank Lie algebras (or groups).

It means that S = Pα SαTα, where {Tα} – some basis in the Lie algebra g. Such type dynamical

systems were introduced by Arnold [1], and were shown to be Liouville integrable in some
particular cases [11, 32, 29]. We focus on elliptic integrable systems which appeared originally
for many-body systems of Calogero-Moser type [36]. The construction of its solutions [17]

2

requires the Lax pair with spectral parameter z living on an elliptic curve Στ = C/Z ⊕ τ Z with
moduli τ , Imτ > 0. For the top like systems such Lax pairs were constructed for continuous
and discrete XYZ models by E. Sklyanin [42, 43] and then were generalized to the Gaudin type
models and to higher rank cases [9, 40, 33] using the Belavin-Drinfeld elliptic r-matrix [6]. Later
both types of elliptic models (the many-body systems and the elliptic tops) were uniﬁed [20] by
the Symplectic Hecke correspondence (the classical analogue of the IRF-Vertex correspondence
[5]). Classiﬁcation of general elliptic models including those of mixed types for simple Lie groups
can be found in [19].
Elliptic slN top is a generalization of the Euler one (1.1) for the case S ∈ Mat(N, C):

˙S = [S, J(S)] , S =

N

Xi,j=1

EijSij = Xα∈ ZN ×ZN ; α6=0

TαSα ,

J(S) = Xα6=0

TαSαJα ,

Jα = −E2(ωα) , ωα =

α1 + α2τ

N

,

(1.4)

(1.5)

where α 6= 0 is a short notation for α = (α1, α2) 6= (0, 0), the set {Ta} is a higher rank analogue
of the Pauli matrices basis in Mat(N, C) (see (A.2)-(A.8)), and E2 is the second Eisenstein
elliptic function (A.13). The absence of α = 0 term in (1.4) means that trS = 0.

The (inverse) inertia tensor J depends on only one complex parameter – the moduli τ of
elliptic curve. In fact, one can multiply J(S) by arbitrary constant and shift all the components
Jα by another one constant (the latter does not eﬀect equations of motion). Thus we have three
parameters, and in this sense the elliptic sl(2, C) top (in this case {ωα} is the set of half-periods
{0, τ /2, 1/2 + τ /2, 1/2}) coincides with the complexiﬁed Euler top.

The Lax equations

˙L(z, S) = [L(z, S), M(z, S)]

(1.6)

(1.7)

written for the Lax pair with the spectral parameter z

L(z) = Xα6=0

TαSαϕα(z, ωα) , M(z) = Xα6=0

TαSαfα(z, ωα)

are equivalent to (1.4)-(1.5) identically in z. The functions entering (1.7) are given in (A.25),
(A.26). Let us also write down equations of motion (1.4) in components Sα (i.e. equations as
coeﬃcient behind Tα)1:

˙Sα = Xβ,γ: β+γ=α

(κβ,γ − κγ,β)SβSγJγ , α 6= 0 ,

(1.8)

where κβ,γ are structure constants deﬁned by relations TβTγ = κβ,γTβ+γ (A.4).
Relativistic elliptic glN top is a deformation of (1.4)-(1.5). It generalizes the non-relativistic
top in the same way as the (elliptic) Ruijsenaars-Schneider model [41] generalizes the Calogero-
Moser model. The Lax equation (1.6) is written for the Lax pair

Lη(z) = Xα

TαSαϕη

α(z) , M η(z) = −Xα6=0

TαSαϕα(z, ωα) , S ∈ Mat(N, C) ,

(1.9)

1In N = 2 case equations (1.8) coincide with (1.1) up to redeﬁnition (A.8) an the factor 1/2ı as in (1.2).

3

where η is the deformation parameter and {ϕη
the equations of motion

a(z)} is the set of functions (A.23). It provides
(1.10)

˙S = [S, J η(S)] ,

J η(S) = Xα6=0

TαSαJ η
α ,

J η
α = E1(η + ωα) − E1(ωα) ,

(1.11)

where E1 – is the ﬁrst Eisenstein function (A.12). For the rank 1 matrix S this model is
gauge equivalent to the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. In the limit η → 0 (1.10)-(1.11)
turns into (1.4)-(1.5). Similarly to (1.8) we have the following equations of motion written in
components Sα:

˙Sα = Xβ,γ: β+γ=α

(κβ,γ − κγ,β)SβSγJ η

γ , α 6= 0;

˙S0 = 0 .

(1.12)

The relativistic top has also η-independent description, which at the level of equations of motion
coincides with the non-relativistic one2. Substitution

Sα → Sαϕα(η, ωα) for α 6= 0 and S0 → S0

(1.13)

transforms (1.12) into (1.8).
γ using (A.11) as
J η
γ = fγ(η, ωγ)/ϕγ(η, ωγ). Then η is cancelled out from equations of motion in the same way as
spectral parameter z is cancelled out from the Lax equations (1.6) providing (1.8).

It can be easily veriﬁed if one represents J η

R-matrix formulation. The (non)relativistic classical tops can be described in terms of quan-
tum R-matrices [21]. In the elliptic case3 we deal with the Baxter-Belavin GLN R-matrix written
in the form:

R

12(z1, z2) = R

12(z1 − z2) = Xa∈ ZN ×ZN

a(z1 − z2) Ta ⊗ T−a ∈ Mat(N, C)⊗2 ,
ϕ

(1.14)

It satisﬁes the quantum Yang-Baxter equation

R

12(z1, z2)R

13(z1, z3)R

23(z2, z3) = R

23(z2, z3)R

13(z1, z3)R

12(z1, z2)

and the unitarity condition which for (1.14) is as follows:

R

12(z1, z2)R

21(z2, z1) = N 2(℘(N ) − ℘(z1 − z2)) 1 ⊗ 1 .

(1.15)

(1.16)

The construction of the (non)relativistic tops uses coeﬃcients of local expansions near  = 0
(the classical limit)

R

12(z) =

1


1 ⊗ 1 + r12(z) +  m12(z) + O(2)

and near z = 0:

R

12(z) =

N
z

P12 + R

,(0)
12 + z R

,(1)
12 + O(z2) ,

r12(z) =

N
z

P12 + r(0)

12 + O(z) ,

2This is because the relativistic top is a quasi-classical version of one site spin chain, and due to the fact that
the elliptic top admits bihamiltonian structure consisting of linear and quadratic Poisson r-matrix structures.
See details in [21, 14].

3See [22] and references therein for the rational and trigonometric cases.

(1.17)

(1.18)

(1.19)

where P12 is the permutation operator (A.6). The coeﬃcient r12(z) from expansion (1.17) is the
classical Belavin-Drinfeld r-matrix [6] (B.2). Explicit expressions for the coeﬃcients are given
in (B.2)-(B.6).

The elliptic top (1.4)-(1.7) is formulated in terms of R-matrix data as follows:

J(S) = tr2(m12(0)S2) , S2 = 1 ⊗ S ,
L(z, S) = tr2(r12(z)S2) , M(z, S) = tr2(m12(z)S2) .

tr(S) = 0 ,

Similarly, for the relativistic elliptic top (1.9)-(1.11) we have:

J η(S) = tr2(cid:16)(cid:16)Rη,(0)

12 − r(0)

12 (cid:17) S2(cid:17) ,

(1.20)

(1.21)

(1.22)

Lη(z, S) = tr2(Rη

(1.23)
where ¯S is a traceless part of S. Details can be found in [21]. M η has no explicit dependence
on η. We keep this notation to emphasize that it is the M-matrix of the relativistic model.

12(z)S2) , M η(z, S) = −tr2(r12(z) ¯S2) ,

Z2 reductions in elliptic tops. To pass to the noncommutative version of the deﬁned above
elliptic tops we will need to impose some constraints. They can be described for the elliptic
tops as the Z2 reduction. The idea of reduction provided by some ﬁnite group in the classical
integrable systems was proposed by Aleksander Mikhailov [31]. It allows one to construct non-
trivial integrable systems starting from some trivial or known integrable systems.

The Z2 reduction under consideration is simply written in terms of coordinates on the phase

space Sα. The corresponding constraints are

for non-relativistic top and

Sα = S−α for all α

Sα

ϕα(η, ωα)

=

S−α

ϕ−α(η,−ωα)

,

for all α 6= 0

(1.24)

(1.25)

in relativistic case. Some details of the reduction are given in the Appendix. Let us just
mention here that in N = 2 case (which is the Euler top (1.1)-(1.3)) the reduction is trivial
since the constraints (1.24) and (1.25) are identities. Indeed, Tα ≡ T−α = σα and Sα ≡ S−α.
The arguments ωα are half-periods τ /2, (τ + 1)/2, 1/2, therefore, using (5.4)-(5.5) it is easy to
show that ϕα(η, ωα) = ϕ−α(η,−ωα). As we will see below in the reduced case one can replace
commuting variables by non commuting.

The classical r-matrix structure on the reduced phase space turns into the classical reﬂection
equation [44]. Two important examples of such type reduction were described in [49] and [26].
The ﬁrst one is the BC1 Calogero-Inozemtsev model [13] described by equation

d2u
dt2 =

Xa=0

ν2
a℘′(u + ωa) .

(1.26)

The second example is the Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat [47]. It generalizes the Euler top (1.1)
to non-zero external ﬁeld

∂tS = [S, J(S)] + [S, ν′] ,

(1.27)

5

where ν′ =

ν′
ασα, and (ν′

1 , ν′

2 , ν′

3) plays the role of constant external ﬁeld (gyrostatic momen-

tum in classical case and magnetic ﬁeld in quantum case). The Lax pair for (1.27) generalizes
(1.7) in the following way:

LZV (z) =

(1.28)

The models (1.26) and (1.27) are gauge equivalent at the level of Lax pairs. Explicit change of
variables Sa = Sa( ˙u, u, ν0, ..., ν3) was obtained in [26]. The constants ν′
α from (1.27) are linear
combinations of να from (1.26) with τ -dependent coeﬃcients (see (1.32)-1.33)). The fourth
(missing) constant in (1.27) appears as the value of (Casimir function) ν′

2 = S2

Painlev´e VI equation as non-autonomous top. The Painlev´e VI equation is the top equa-
tion in the hierarchy of the classiﬁcation of non-linear ODE of second order possessing the
Painlev´e property.
It depends on four constants and can be deﬁned as the monodromy pre-
serving condition for a linear diﬀerential system with meromorphic coeﬃcients deﬁned on CP 1.
Equivalently, it can be formulated in elliptic form [37, 30]. Then it takes the form of a non-
autonomous version of the Calogero-Inozemtsev system BC1 (1.26):

d2u
dτ 2 =

3

Xa=0

ν2
a℘′(u + ωa) ,

(1.29)

while the monodromy preserving condition is of the form:

∂τ L(w) −

1
2πı

∂wM(w) = [L(w), M(w)] .

(1.30)

Equation (1.29) is non-autonomous since ℘′(u + ωa) depends on moduli τ in both - explicit
(through its dependence on ωa) and implicit (through deﬁnition (A.13) of ℘-function) ways.
Similarly, one can deﬁne the non-autonomous version of the Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat (1.27)

∂τ S = [S, J(S)] + [S, ν′] .

(1.31)

The latter model is non-autonomous due to τ -dependence of the components of (inverse) inertia
tensor Jα (1.5) and the τ -dependence entering ν′
α:

ν′
α = cα(τ )˜να ,

cα(τ ) = ϕα(z, ωα)ϕα(z − ωα, ωα) = − exp(−2πi ωa∂τ ωa)(cid:18) ϑ′(0)

˜ν1 = 1
˜ν3 = 1

2 (ν0 + ν1 − ν2 − ν3) ,
2 (ν0 − ν1 − ν2 + ν3) ,

(1.33)

where the set of νa consists of τ -independent constants from (1.29). Equations (1.29) and (1.31)
are again (as in autonomous case) gauge equivalent. The corresponding change of variables
Sa = Sa( ˙u, u, τ, ν0, ..., ν3) is given in [26].
In this sense equation (1.31) is also a form of the

6

Painlev´e VI equation4. The Lax pair generating (1.31) through (1.30) is (almost) the same as
in the autonomous case:

LP V I(w) = LZV (w)

(1.32)

σα (Sαϕα(w, ωα) + ˜ναϕα(w − ωα, ωα)) ,

(1.34)

M P V I(w) = M ZV (w) + E1(w)LZV (w) .

It is an example of the so-called classical Painlev´e-Calogero correspondence [18] claiming that
properly deﬁned Lax pairs for elliptic non-relativistic models describe both - integrable mechan-
ics through the Lax equation (1.6) and the monodromy preserving equation through (1.30). The
proof of this fact is based on the heat equation (A.17) for the Kronecker function. In a general
(Euler-Arnold) case the heat equation holds for R-matrices (1.17):

2πı ∂τ R

12(z) = ∂z∂R

12(z) ,

2πı ∂τ r12(z) = ∂zm12(z) .

(1.35)

In slN case substitution of the Lax pair (1.7) into (1.8) leads to non-autonomous Euler-Arnold
top

∂τ S = [S, J(S)] ,

(1.36)

which can be considered as multidimensional analogue of Painlev´e equations.

Purpose of paper:

1. Lax equations from associative Yang-Baxter equation. The quantum Baxter-
Belavin R-matrix (1.14)-(1.16) can be interpreted as matrix generalization of the Kronecker
function (A.9) [38, 23, 24, 25]. Similarly to this scalar function R-matrix satisﬁes relations which
are matrix analogues of the elliptic function identities and properties. The most important for
our purposes (see also Appendix) are:

• associative Yang-Baxter equation [38] (analogue of the Fay identity (A.18)):

• skew-symmetry (analogue of φ(, z) = −φ(−,−z) and E1(z) = −E1(−z)):
r12(z) = −r21(−z) , m12(z) = m21(−z) ,

12(z) = −R−

21 (−z) ,

(1.37)

(1.38)

In Section 2 it is shown that Lax equations with Lax pairs of the relativistic (1.23) or non-
relativistic (1.21) top are equivalent to equations of motion (1.10) or (1.4) with the inverse inertia
tensors (1.22) or (1.20) respectively. We do not explicitly use the elliptic function identities.
Our derivation is valid for any R-matrices (1.14)-(1.19) satisfying also (1.37), (1.38).

2. Matrix extensions of tops. A direct meaning of a matrix extension is that (the
scalar, C-valued) variables of a model are replaced by noncommutative Mat(M, C) matrices.
See examples in [34]. When M = 1 we come back to initial system. Matrix extension can be
thought of as noncommutative version of a model.
It is then described by noncommutative
(double) Poisson brackets [15]. Appearance of matrix variables provides also additional GLM

4See also [28] for interrelations between elliptic forms of the Painlev´e VI.

symmetry: this group acts on all matrix variables by conjugation. The corresponding Poisson
algebra and its quantization was studied in [3]. The double brackets formalism is not used in
our paper. Our aim is to get equations of motion for matrix extensions by generalizing the Lax
pairs.

The set of variables (or the coordinates on the phase space) in the elliptic glN top {Sα ∈

C, α ∈ ZN × ZN} should be replaced by set of matrices {Sα ∈ Mat(M, C)}:
α ∈ Mat(M, C) , α ∈ ZN × ZN ,

Sα → Sα = X˜α∈ ZM ×ZM

˜T ˜α S ˜α

(1.39)

where { ˜T ˜α ∈ Mat(M, C), ˜α ∈ ZM × ZM} is the basis (A.2) in Mat(M, C). We will use tildes for
”matrix ” or ”noncommutative” space5. It becomes ”scalar” or ”commutative” when M = 1.
The space Mat(N, C) is an auxiliary space. It coincides with the matrix space of Lax equations
(1.6) or matrix form of equations of motion (1.7) of initial (scalar) models.

A natural way to get generalizations of the construction of Lax pairs (1.23), (1.21) to matrix-

valued variables is to consider the following Mat(NM, C)⊗2-valued R-matrix:

Rη
12,˜1˜2(z) = Rη

12(z) ⊗ ˜P˜1˜2 ,

(1.40)

where Rη
12(z) is the same Mat(N, C)⊗2-valued R-matrix in auxiliary space as in (1.23), while
˜P˜1˜2 is the permutation operator in noncommutative space. It is easy to see that Rη
12,˜1˜2(z) is
indeed R-matrix in the sense of quantum Yang-Baxter equation (1.15) and unitarity condition
(1.16). Moreover, it satisﬁes the associative Yang-Baxter equation (1.37) as well. However it
has a diﬀerent to (1.17) classical limit (it starts not from −1 1N M × 1N M ). For this reason the
general construction of the Lax pairs does not work for matrix extensions in the same way as in
scalar case. To overcome this problem additional constraints are required. The ﬁrst one is that

S0 = 1M S0 ,

(1.41)

i.e. matrix extension of S0 variable should be also scalar. This condition obviously needs to
be preserved by dynamics (equations of motion). The latter provides another constraint. With
these constraints the generalization of construction of Lax pairs works for R-matrix (1.40) and
provides equations of motion

˙S
1˜1 = [S

1˜1, J1(S

1˜1)] ,

(1.42)

where the inertia tensor J acts in auxiliary space only.

We will show that the above mentioned constraints are fulﬁlled for matrix extensions of Z2
reduced elliptic tops. It means that similarly to (1.24) we set Sα = S−α. In this case one obtains

˙Sα = Xβ,γ: β+γ=α(cid:16)κβ,γ Sβ Sγ − κγ,β Sγ Sβ(cid:17) Jγ , α 6= 0 .

(1.43)

where Jγ = −E2(ωγ). In scalar case M = 1 the latter equations coincide with (1.8). The same
holds true for the relativistic top (1.12) and Z2-reduction constraints (1.25).

5The noncommutativity means that SαSβ 6= Sβ Sα, and we do not imply any constraints for any Sα inside

noncommutative space.

8

Remark 1 In this construction one can replace the algebra Mat(M, C) by an arbitrary associa-
tive noncommutative algebra with a well deﬁned trace functional and the permutation operator
acting on the basis of the algebra. For example, one can take the inﬁnite group of the quantum
torus, its trigonometric and rational degenerations, or their quasi-classical limits to the algebras
of vector ﬁelds.

Remark 2 Our results allows one to deﬁne the equations of motion in the Hamiltonian form
using double Poisson brackets [16, 45, 10] as it was done in [34, 3, 2]. It is straightforward to
construct the ”classical” ˜r-matrix by means the classical r-matrix (1.17) and the permutation
operator in Mat(M, C) and consider the classical reﬂection equation deﬁned by ˜r. It leads the
double Poisson brackets for the Lax operators Lη(z, S) in terms of the ˜r-matrix. Furthermore,
it is open a way to quantize the noncommutative tops by means of the R-matrix (1.40) and the
quantum reﬂection equation.

In the end of the paper we also describe a special elliptic Gaudin model with equations of

motion

˙Aα = Xβ+γ=α

[Aβ, Aγ] Jγ α 6= 0 ,

(1.44)

where {Aα} is a set of N 2 − 1 matrices of size N × N with constraints Aα = A−α. Equations
(1.44) reproduce the elliptic top equations of motion (1.8) via reduction Aα → TαSα (Sα = S−α).
3. Matrix extensions of Painlev´e equations. Finally, we construct the noncommutative
generalization of the Painlev´e VI equation. The non-commutative generalizations of the Painlev´e
II-IV equations were considered before in [8, 7, 35, 39]. Here we identify the non-commutative
Painlev´e VI equation with the non-commutative non-autonomous Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat
(1.31):

These equations takes the form (1.31) for N = 1. Our construction allows one to deﬁne the Lax
pair for the Painlev´e VI equation using the same Lax operators as for the autonomous case.

2 Lax pairs from associative Yang-Baxter equation

In this Section we do not use explicit forms of Lax pairs but only the properties of the underlying
R-matrices. Our current purpose is to show that the Lax equations with the R-matrix forms
of the Lax pairs of integrable tops (1.21), (1.23) are equivalent to equations of motion (1.4),
(1.10) with the corresponding inertia tensors (1.20), (1.22) due to additional properties of R-
matrix (1.37), (1.38). Below we prove these statements for relativistic and non-relativistic tops
separately.

9

Proposition 2.1 Suppose that quantum R-matrix entering the Lax pair of the relativistic top
(1.23) satisﬁes not only (1.15)-(1.19) but also the associative Yang-Baxter equation (1.37) and
the skew-symmetry property (1.38). Then the Lax equations (1.6) with the Lax pair (1.23) are
equivalent to equations of motion of the relativistic top (1.10) with (inverse) inertia tensor J η
(1.22).

Proof:

Let us verify that the Lax equations

with Lη and M η (1.23) are fulﬁlled on equations of motion

˙Lη(z, S) = [Lη(z, S), M η(z, S)]

˙S = [S, J η(S)] , J η(S) = tr2(cid:16)(cid:16)Rη,(0)

12 − r(0)

12 (cid:17) S2(cid:17)

identically in spectral parameter z, i.e.

Lη(z, [S, J η(S)]) = [Lη(z, S), M η(z, S)] , ∀ z .

The l.h.s. of (2.3) is equal to6

23 (cid:17) S3]o =
23 ] S2S3o ,

where we have used r(0)
32 (B.8). To simplify the r.h.s. of (2.3) notice that ¯S in (1.23)
can be replaced by S since the scalar part of M η does not give any input to [Lη, M η]. In fact
¯S in (1.23) is used in order to match the elliptic deﬁnition (1.9). This question will become
nontrivial in the case of matrix valued variables.

Let us write down (B.11) with z3 = 0, which is a consequence of the associative Yang-Baxter

equation (1.37):

[Rη

13(z1), r12(z1 − z2)] = [Rη

12(z1 − z2), Rη

23(z2)] + [Rη

13(z1), r23(z2)]

and consider the limit z2 → 0 (together with renaming z1 := z):

[Rη

13(z), r12(z)] = [Rη

12(z), Rη,(0)

23

] + [Rη

13(z), r(0)

23 ] − [∂zRη

12(z), NP23]

(2.5)

(2.6)

The simple pole at z2 = 0 cancel out due to [Rη
permutation operator. From (1.23) and (2.6) we conclude that

12(z), P23] + [Rη

13(z), P23] = 0 by deﬁnition of

[Lη(z, S), M η(z, S)]1 = −tr2,3n[Rη

23

= −tr2,3n[Rη

1(z, [S, J η(S)]) .

(2.7)

6The index 1 in (2.4) is the number of tensor component corresponding to the matrix space Mat(N, C) of
equation (2.3). We sometimes omit this index where it is obvious (for example, in l.h.s. of (1.20)-(1.23)). The
components 2,3 are under trace.

10

Here we used that tr2,3n[∂zRη

12(z), NP23] S2S3o = 0 since [P23, S2S3] = 0. In this way we ﬁnished

the proof of (2.3) as identity in z on equations of motion (2.2). Conversely, (following [21]) one
can easily obtain the equations of motion (2.2) from the Lax equations (2.1) by taking residue
of both parts of (2.1) at z = 0. (cid:4)

Let us remark that in [21] we did not prove (2.3), i.e. that the Lax equations are identities
in spectral parameter on the equations of motion. Instead, the following indirect argument was
used: we know that (2.3) holds true in the elliptic case. Other cases are degenerations of the
elliptic one. A degeneration procedure can be performed at the level of Lax equation as well as
at the level of equations of motion. That is, we used explicit elliptic formulae to argue that the
Lax equations are identities in z. The above given proof (2.1)-(2.7) is more general. It does not
use any explicit form. It is direct and based on the associative Yang-Baxter equation only.

Let us now prove a similar statement for non-relativistic top.

Proposition 2.2 Suppose that quantum R-matrix entering (through expansion (1.17)) the Lax
pair of the non-relativistic top (1.21) satisﬁes not only (1.15)-(1.19) but also the associative
Yang-Baxter equation (1.37) and the skew-symmetry property (1.38). Then the Lax equations
(1.6) with the Lax pair (1.21) (with trS = 0) are equivalent to equations of motion of the
non-relativistic top (1.4) with (inverse) inertia tensor J (1.20).

Proof:

In this case trS = NS0 = 0. Let us verify that the Lax equations

˙L(z, S) = [L(z, S), M(z, S)]

with L and M (1.21) are fulﬁlled on equations of motion

˙S = [S, J(S)] , J(S) = tr2 (m12(0)S2)

identically in spectral parameter z, i.e.

The l.h.s. of (2.10) equals

L(z, [S, J(S)]) = [L(z, S), M(z, S)] , ∀ z .

L(z, [S, J(S)])1 = tr2,3nr12(z)[S2, m23(0)S3]o = tr2,3n[m23(0), r12(z)] S2S3o .

To simplify the r.h.s. of (2.10) we use (B.12). Write it down for z3 = 0

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

[m13(z1), r12(z1 − z2)] = [r12(z1 − z2), m23(z2)] + [m12(z1 − z2), r23(z2)] + [m13(z1), r23(z2)]

and consider the limit z2 → 0 (with renaming z1 := z). The simple pole at z2 = 0 cancel out
due to [m12(z), P23] + [m13(z), P23] = 0 and we have:

[m13(z), r12(z)] = [r12(z), m23(0)] − [∂zm12(z), NP23] + [m12(z), r(0)

23 ] + [m13(z), r(0)

23 ] .

Now we can compute

[L(z, S), M(z, S)]1 = tr2,3n[r12(z), m13(z)] S2S3o (2.12)

= tr2,3n[m23(0), r12(z)] S2S3o =

(2.11)

= L(z, [S, J(S)])1 .

11

(2.12)

(2.13)

In the equality via (2.12) we used that tr2,3n[∂zm12(z), NP23] S2S3o = 0 due to [P23, S2S3] = 0

and

tr2,3n(cid:16)[m12(z), r(0)

23 ] + [m13(z), r(0)

23 ](cid:17) S2S3o = 0

because the expression [m12(z), r(0)
to the property r(0)

23 = −r(0)
32 .

23 ] + [m13(z), r(0)

23 ] is skew symmetric with respect to 2 ↔ 3 due

Conversely, we can obtain the equations of motion (2.9) from the Lax equations (2.8) by

taking the residue at z = 0 of its both sides. (cid:4)

3 Matrix valued tops

In paragraph below we argue why the construction of Section 2 can not be directly generalized
to matrix extensions of the tops models. It appears that matrix variables are not arbitrary but
satisfy some constraints. Then we mention that these constraints are fulﬁlled for Z2 reduced
models and describe their matrix extensions.

General construction and constraints. A general idea of matrix extension is to replace
scalar variables Sα ∈ C by matrix valued variables Sα ∈ Mat(M, C) (1.39). The initial scalar
variables of a top model Sα were themselves arranged into the matrix valued variable S =
Pα TαSα ∈ Mat(N, C) (the residue of the Lax matrix). Therefore, we deal with the following

matrix variable:

S ∈ Mat(N, C) → S = S

1˜1 =

N

M

Xα

X˜α

Tα ⊗ ˜T ˜α S ˜α

α = Xα

Tα ⊗ Sα ∈ Mat(NM, C) ,

(3.1)

where indices 1, ˜1 stand for Mat(N, C) and Mat(M, C) tensor components respectively likewise
it is used in R-matrix notations.

Recall that the Lax matrix of integrable top was deﬁned as (1.21) Lη(z, S) = tr2(Rη
The latter means that for a given R-matrix written in standard basis of Mat(N, C) as

12(z)S2).

Rη

12(z) =

N

Xi,j,k,l=1

Eij ⊗ Ekl Rijkl(z, η)

the corresponding Lax matrix (1.23) is of the form:

Lη(z, S) =

N

Xi,j,k,l=1

EijSkl Rijlk(z, η) .

(3.2)

(3.3)

A natural way to get a matrix generalization is to consider the following expression:

12,˜1˜2(z) = Rη
Rη

12(z) ⊗ ˜P˜1˜2 =

N

M

Xi,j,k,l=1

Xm,n=1

Eij ⊗ Ekl ⊗ ˜Emn ⊗ ˜Enm Rijkl(z, η) ,

(3.4)

where ˜Emn is standard basis in Mat(M, C) and ˜P˜1˜2 is the permutation operator in Mat(M, C)⊗2.

First, notice that this expression is again a quantum R-matrix.

˜P˜1˜2 = ˜P˜2˜3

˜P˜1˜3. Such type quantum and classical R-matrix

Second, similarly to (3.3) the Lax matrix corresponding to R-matrix (3.4)

(3.8)

is exactly the matrix generalization of (3.3).

Therefore, we could expect to have a direct generalization (to the matrix case) of the Lax
pairs construction via associative Yang-Baxter equation described in Section 2. However, we
will see that it does not work in the same way. The reason is that the R-matrix (3.4) do not
satisfy the local expansion of the classical limit (1.17). Indeed, near  = 0

R

12,˜1˜2(z) =



1N ⊗ 1N ⊗ ˜P˜1˜2 + r12,˜1˜2(z) + O() ,

(3.9)

i.e. in contrast to (1.17) the ﬁrst coeﬃcient of the expansion (3.9) is not 1N M ⊗ 1N M . It makes
problem in the following way. The proofs of equivalence of Lax equations and equations of motion
given in Section 2 used not the associative Yang-Baxter equation itself but its degenerations (2.6)
or (2.12) which appeared from (B.11). Equation (B.11) in its turn was obtained by subtracting
(B.10) from (B.9). For R-matrix (3.4) instead (B.9), (B.10) we have

Diﬀerence between (3.10) and (3.11) contains unwanted term ∂R

that is matrix analogue of the variable trS (or S0 in basis {Tα}) should be not an arbitrary
Mat(M, C) matrix but the one proportional to identity matrix 1M . It is easy to see that the
coeﬃcient behind 1M in (3.14) should be a constant on equations of motion (since it equals
tr2˜1

2˜1/M) Therefore, the next set of constraints is generated by
S

tr1 ˙S

1˜1 = 0

(3.15)

which means that (3.14) should be preserved by dynamics of equations of motion.

Equations of motion and Lax pairs. On constraints (3.14), when (3.12) is true, we have
the following equation obtained by subtracting (3.11) from (3.10):

tr2,3,˜2,˜3n(cid:16)[R

12,˜1˜2, R

23,˜2˜3] − [R

13,˜1˜3](cid:17) S

2˜2

S

3˜3o = 0 ,

(3.16)

It is analogous to tr2,3{(eq. (2.5))S2S3}, which underlied the Lax equations in scalar case. For
a similar reason we obtain the following equations of motion in relativistic case:

˙S
1˜1 = [S

1˜1, J η

1 (S

1˜1)] ,

where

J η
1 (S

1˜1) = tr2˜2((Rη,(0)

2˜2) = tr2˜2((Rη,(0)

12 − r(0)

12 ) ⊗ ˜P˜1˜2

2˜2) =
S

In scalar case M = 1 the latter equation turns into (2.2). The Lax pair is given by

= tr2((Rη,(0)

12 − r(0)

12 ) S

2˜1) .

Lη(z, S) = tr2,˜2(cid:16)R η

12,˜1˜2(z) S

2˜2(cid:17) , M η(z, S) = tr2,˜2(cid:0)r12,˜1˜2(z) S

2˜2(cid:1) .

In non-relativistic case equations of motion are

1˜1 = [S

1˜1, J1(S

where

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

2˜2) = tr2˜2(m12(0) ⊗ ˜P˜1˜2

2˜2) = tr2(m12(0) S
S

2˜1) .

(3.21)

The Lax pair is given by

L(z, S) = tr2,˜2(cid:0)r12,˜1˜2(z) S

2˜2(cid:1) , M(z, S) = tr2,˜2(cid:0)m12,˜1˜2(z) S

2˜2(cid:1) .

(3.22)

Let us stress again that together with (3.17) or (3.20) the constraints (3.14), (3.15) should be
fulﬁlled. Below we will see that these constraints are fulﬁlled for a special class of elliptic matrix
tops.

Matrix generalization of Z2 reduced elliptic tops. We start with non-relativistic case.
Similarly to (1.7) and following (3.22) we have the following Lax pair for the matrix elliptic top:

L(z, S) = Xα6=0

Tα ⊗ Sα ϕα(z, ωα) , M(z, S) = Xα6=0

Tα ⊗ Sα fα(z, ωα) .

(3.23)

The r.h.s. of the Lax equation

is equal to

(3.26)

(3.27)

where Jγ = −E2(ωγ) as in (1.5) and κγ,β are structure constants (A.4). Finally, equations of
motion take the form

˙Sα = Xβ,γ: β+γ=α(cid:16)κβ,γ Sβ Sγ − κγ,β Sγ Sβ(cid:17) Jγ , α 6= 0; Jγ = −E2(ωγ) .

(3.28)

In scalar case M = 1 the latter equations coincide with (1.8).

In the above equations we did not include α = 0 component into the Lax pair (3.23), i.e.
S0 = 0, and therefore (3.14) is fulﬁlled. However (3.15) is not fulﬁlled. Indeed, for α = β + γ = 0
in (3.26) we need to use (A.22) instead of (A.20). It yields (κβ,−β = 1) the following explicit
expression for (3.15):

0 = ˙S0 = Xβ6=0

[Sβ, S−β] E′

2(ωβ) .

(3.29)

It is nontrivial because E′
set

2(z) is an odd function. A natural way to fulﬁll this constraint is to

χ : Sα = S−α ,

for all α .

It is matrix analogue of Z2 reduced elliptic top deﬁned by (1.24).

The set of constraints (3.30) is preserved by dynamics (3.28):

˙S−α |χ = ˙Sα |χ

15

(3.30)

(3.31)

since κ−β,−γ = κβ,γ and Jα = J−α. Therefore, we have well deﬁned matrix valued elliptic top
given by the Lax pair (3.23), equations of motion (3.28) and Z2 reduction constraints (3.30).

In relativistic case we have the following direct generalization of (1.9):

Lη(z, S) = Xα

Tα ⊗ Sα ϕα(z, ωα + η) , M η(z, S) = −Xα6=0

Tα ⊗ Sα ϕα(z, ωα) .

(3.32)

The Lax equations lead to equations of motion (3.20) for matrix-variables

˙Sα = Xβ,γ: β+γ=α(cid:16)κβ,γ Sβ Sγ − κγ,β Sγ Sβ(cid:17) J η

γ , α 6= 0; J η

α = E1(η + ωα) − E1(ωα)

via (A.19). The constraints (3.14), (3.15) means that

S0 = S0 1M ,

where 1M is identity M × M matrix, and
Sα =

1

ϕα(η, ωα)

1

ϕ−α(η,−ωα)

S−α , α 6= 0 .

(3.33)

(3.34)

(3.35)

Let us now mention that the derivation of equations of motion from the Lax pairs (3.23) or
(3.32) did not use that S is a matrix. In fact, we can perform the same calculation thinking of
Sα as elements of associative and noncommutative algebra.

4 Noncommutative Painlev´e VI equation

As it was explained in the Introduction the Lax pair (1.7) of the non-relativistic top (1.8) satisﬁes
also the monodromy preserving condition (1.30) and provides in this way the non-autonomous
version of the Euler-Arnold equations (1.36). This construction is straightforwardly generalized
to the matrix extension of elliptic top described by the Lax pair (3.23). Namely, we have the
following statement.

Proposition 4.1 The Lax pair

L(z, S) = Xα6=0

Tα ⊗ Sα ϕα(z, ωα) , M(z, S) = Xα6=0

Tα ⊗ Sα fα(z, ωα) .

5 Special elliptic Gaudin models as matrix tops

Consider the following glN Lax pair given by N × N matrices
Aαϕα(z, ωα) , M G(z) = Xα6=0

LG(z) = A0 +Xα6=0

Aαfα(z, ωα) ,

where Aα ∈ Mat(N, C) is a set of glN -valued matrices with constraints

A0 = 1N S0 ,

Aα = A−α for all α 6= 0 ,

follows from quasiperiodic properties

It can be viewed as a special elliptic Gaudin model.

Indeed, it

that (for α 6= 0)

φ(z + 1, u) = φ(z, u) , φ(z + τ, u) = exp(−2πıu)φ(z, u)

ϕα(z + 1, ωα) = exp(2πı

ϕα(z + τ, ωα) = exp(−2πı

) ϕα(z, ωα) .

(5.4)

(5.5)

Therefore, functions (sections of bundle) {ϕα(z)} are double-periodic on a ”large” torus ΣN,N τ
generated by fundamental parallelogram with periods N, Nτ . The latter means that LG(z) is a
double-periodic function on ΣN,N τ with N 2 − 1 simple poles at points Nωα = α1 + α2τ , α 6= 0.
The residues at these points are linear combinations of Aβ:

Res
z=N ωα

LG(z) = Xβ6=0

κ2
β,αAβ ,

(5.6)

where κβ,α is given by (A.4). This is why we refer to this model as Gaudin one. The Lax
equations are equivalent to

˙Aα = Xβ+γ=α

[Aβ, Aγ] Jγ ,

Jγ = −E2(ωγ) , α 6= 0 .

(5.7)

These equations generalize the elliptic top equations of motion (1.8) in the following sense.
Equations (1.8) are reproduced from (5.7) via reduction

Aα = TαSα .

(5.8)

At the same time (5.3) reduces to (1.24), i.e. (5.7) can be viewed as matrix generalization of Z2
reduced elliptic top.

As in (3.29) the constraints (5.3) fulﬁll the constrain

0 = ˙A0 = Xβ

[Aβ, A−β] E′

2(ωβ) ,

(5.9)

which appear from ”zero mode” of the Lax equations.
˙Aα = ˙A−α on constraints (5.3), i.e. these constraints are preserved by dynamics.

In the same way, similarly to (3.31)

Similarly to results of the previous section we can easily construct non-autonomous models
generalizing (5.7) through the monodromy preserving condition (1.30). The answer is as follows:

d
dτ

Aα = Xβ+γ=α

[Aβ, Aγ] Jγ ,

Jγ = −E2(ωγ) , α 6= 0 .

(5.10)

It is interesting to mention that in N = 2 case these equations are equivalent to the Painlev´e
VI equation (1.29) after reduction by coadjoint action of ”common” GL(2, C): Aα → gAαg−1.
See details in [28].

6.1 Elliptic functions

The Kronecker and Eisenstein functions [46]. The following set of elliptic functions8 on
elliptic curve C/Z ⊕ τ Z with moduli τ (Imτ > 0) is widely used in this paper:

8To be exact, some of these function are not double-periodic. In this sense they are not functions but rather
sections of bundles (the Kronecker functions) or components of connections (E1-function). See the quasi-periodic
properties e.g. in [24].

The Kronecker function

φ(η, z) =

ϑ′(0)ϑ(η + z)

f (z, u) ≡ ∂uφ(z, u) = φ(z, u)(E1(z + u) − E1(u))

E1(z) = ϑ′(z)/ϑ(z) .

6.2 R-matrix structures for elliptic tops

Let us list explicit formulae for the coeﬃcients of expansions (1.17)-(1.19). First, write down
again the Baxter-Belavin R-matrix (1.14) with both arguments in ϕ-functions (see notations
(A.23)-(A.26)):

R 

12(z) = Xα∈ ZN ×ZN

ϕα(z, ωα + ) Tα ⊗ T−α .

Using (A.14), (A.15) we obtain the classical Belavin-Drinfeld r-matrix

r12(z) = E1(z) 1 ⊗ 1 +Xα6=0

ϕα(z, ωα) Tα ⊗ T−α .

It satisﬁes the classical Yang-Baxter equation

[r12, r13] + [r12, r23] + [r13, r23] = 0 ,

rab = rab(za − zb)

due to the quantum one (1.15). The next term in (1.17):

m12(z) =

12(z) − 1 ⊗ 1 N 2℘(z)(cid:17) .

The second line follows from the unitarity condition (1.16).

Using local expansion (A.14) we obtain the terms from (1.18), (1.19):

R,(0)
12 = Xα

Properties and identities. The skew-symmetry (1.38) of the quantum R matrix (B.1) as well
as the unitarity (1.16) leads to

r21(−z) ≡ P12 r12(−z) P12 = −r12(z) , m12(z) = m21(−z) ,

Various formulae relating the coeﬃcients follow from the associative Yang-Baxter equation
(1.37) (and the original Yang-Baxter equation (1.15)). In particular, in the limit η →  it gives:

23 = R

By changing indices 1 ↔ 3 (i.e. conjugating equation by P13 and renaming z1 ↔ z3), changing
also  → − and then using skew-symmetry (1.38) it transforms into

Subtracting (B.10) from (B.9) yields

[R

12, R

23] = [R

13, r23] .

Taking the limit  → 0 and using (B.3) provides

[r12, m13 + m23] = [r23, m12 + m13]

or (by interchanging 1 ↔ 2)

[r12, m13 + m23] + [r13, m12 + m23] = 0 .

R-matrices can be found in [25] and [48].

6.3 Z2 reduction in elliptic tops

In this paragraph we explain Z2 reduction (1.24) in three ways. First, as an invariant ﬂow of the
equations of motion (1.4). Second, from the geometry of the Euler-Arnold tops. And ﬁnally, as
a reduction of the Lax equations (1.6).

The ﬁrst way is straightforward. Impose the constraints

Sα = S−α for all α .

(C.1)

for the non-relativistic top (1.4)-(1.8). These constraints are preserved by dynamics (1.8) because
Jα = J−α and κ−β,−γ = κβ,γ. Therefore, the constrains are well deﬁned.

The Euler-Arnold equations (1.4) deﬁne a ﬂow on a coadjoint orbit of the group SL(N, C).
One can pass to some Z2-invariant semi-simple subgroup Ginv ⊂ SL(N, C) and consider the
inv)∗ =Lie∗(Ginv). If the
Euler-Arnold equations on the coadjoint orbits in the Lie coalgebra (g
inverse inertia tensor J is also Z2-invariant then these orbits become invariant phase subspaces
of the original phase space (1.4). In what follows we use the following subgroup

Ginv = (cid:26) SL(N/2 + 1, C) × SL(N/2 − 1, C) × C∗ ,

N − even ,
SL((N + 1)/2, C) × SL((N − 1)/2, C) × C∗ , N − odd ,

(C.2)

22

and N > 3. For N = 3, Ginv =SL(2, C) × C∗, and for N = 2 Ginv =SL(2, C).

For the non-relativistic tops we consider the corresponding Lie algebras. The Z2 reduction is
provided by the second order automorphisms ς of sl(N, C). In terms of the generators Tα (A.2)
ς acts as

Explicitly, it is deﬁned by the conjugation by the matrix h

ς : Tα → T−α .

ς : x → hxh−1 , h = J Λ−1 , Jij = δi,N −j+1

where Λ is the one from (A.1). It follows from J 2 = 1N and

J ΛJ = Λ−1 .

that ς is an involution ς 2 = 1. For the matrix Q from (A.1) we also have

h Q h−1 = J Λ−1QΛJ

(C.5)

= exp(cid:16) −

2πı

N (cid:17)J QJ = Q−1 .

Therefore, for the matrices Tα (A.2) we obtain (C.3)

h Tα h−1 = T−α

for all α .

(C.3)

(C.4)

(C.5)

(C.6)

(C.7)

Therefore, the invariant subalgebra has generators 1

2(Tα + T−α), and by imposing the constraints

we come to the invariant subalgebra

Sα = S−α for all α

g

inv = {

1

2 Xα

Sα(Tα + T−α)} = Lie(Ginv) (C.2) .

(C.8)

(C.9)

Since J (1.5) is also Z2-invariant the reduction to Ginv is consistent with the equations of motion.
To prove that Ginv has the form (C.2) we diagonalize h (C.4). The matrix h has m eigenvalues
λ = 1 and n λ = −1 (m + n = N), where m = N/2 + 1 for N even, and m = (N + 1)/2 for N
odd. Therefore, the subgroup of SL(N, C) commuting with h has the form (C.2).

As usual, to prove the integrability of the reduced system we represent the equations of
motion in the Lax form (1.6). Consider the Lax operator L(z) (1.7). It is a meromorphic map
from the complex plane C to the Lie algebra sl(N, C) satisfying ﬁxed quasi-periodicities with
It
respect to the shifts on the lattice Z ⊕ τ Z. Consider the automorphism z → −z of C.
preserves the lattice Z ⊕ τ Z and in this way Στ . Consider the equivariant maps C →sl(N, C)
with respect to the automorphisms ς (C.3) and the automorphism z → −z. It can be found
that the combined actions of these automorphisms preserves the quasi-periodicity conditions.
Deﬁne the Lax operator as an equivariant map9

From (C.1) we ﬁnd the equivariant Lax operator

hLinv(Sα,−z)h−1 = −Linv(Sα, z) .

(C.10)

Linv(z) =

1

2 Xα

Sα (ϕα(z)Tα + ϕ−α(z)T−α) =

1

2 Xα

(Sα + S−α) ϕα(z)Tα .

(C.11)

9In fact, the Lax operator is a one-form L(z)dz and the sign ”−” in the r.h.s. of (C.10) is then absent.

23

The operator M(z) (1.7) is map of 0-forms to sl(N, C) and due to (1.7), (A.11) and (A.26) is
also the equivariant map. The equivariant maps form a Lie algebra. Therefore, the Lax equation
being reduced on the equivariant operators Linv, M inv is equivalent to the equations of motion
on the constrained surface.

Put it diﬀerently, we can say that the set of constraints (C.1) is generated by involution ς

(C.4) acting on the Lax matrix:

ς(L(z, S)) = h L(−z, S) h−1 .

(C.12)

Indeed, it follows from (C.5)-(C.7) that the action of ς (C.12) on the Lax matrix (1.7) is given
as follows:

h L(−z, S) h−1 = Xα6=0

T−αSαϕα(−z, ωα) = −Xα6=0
where we used ϕα(−z, ωα) = −ϕ−α(z,−ωα). Thus, condition

TαS−αϕα(z, ωα) ,

(C.13)

ς(L(z, S)) = −L(z, S)

(C.14)

is equivalent to (C.1).

In fact, the involution leads to decomposition

L±(z, S) =

1
2

(L(z, S) ± ς(L(z, S))) =

1

2 Xα6=0

Tα(Sα ∓ S−α)ϕα(z, ωα) .

(C.15)

Condition (C.14) or (C.1) is equivalent to L+(z, S) = 0, and we are left with L−(z, S) = Linv(z)
on the reduced phase space.

In relativistic case we use relation to η-independent description, i.e. from (1.13) and (C.1)

we get

Sα

ϕα(η, ωα)

=

, α 6= 0

(C.16)

and S0 is not changed. Then similarly to non-relativistic case these constraints are preserved
by dynamics (1.12).
