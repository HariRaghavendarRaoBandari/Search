V. S. Monakhov and I. L. Sokhor

March 22, 2016

Abstract

A subgroup H of a ﬁnite group G is wide if each prime divisor of the order of G
divides the order of H. We obtain the description of ﬁnite soluble groups with no wide
subgroups. We also prove that a ﬁnite soluble group with nilpotent wide subgroups has
the quotient group by its hypercenter with no wide subgroups.

Keywords: ﬁnite groups, soluble groups, nilpotent groups.

Introduction

All groups in this paper are ﬁnite. All notations and terminology are standard. The reader is
referred to [1, 2] if necessary.

Let G be a group. We use π(G) to denote the set of all prime devisors of |G|. By |π(G)|
we denote a number of diﬀerent prime devisors of |G|. A subgroup H of a group G is said to
be wide if π(H) = π(G).

Let k be a positive integer. A group G is called k-primary if |π(G)| = k. If |π(G)| = 1
or |π(G)| = 2, then G is said to be primary or biprimary, respectively. A group G is quasi-
k-primary if |π(G)| > k and |π(M)| ≤ k for every maximal subgroup M of G. Obviously,
quasi-k-primary groups have no wide subgroups.

A quasi-1-primary group is also called quasiprimary, and a quasi-2-primary group is also
called quasibiprimary [3]. It is clear that the order of a nilpotent quasiprimary group is equal
to pq, where p and q are primes. A nonnilpotent quasiprimary group G can be represented
as the semidirect product G = [Epa]Zq of a normal elementary abelian group Epa, |Epa| = pa,
by a cyclic group Zq, |Zq| = q, where a is the exponent of p. This follows from Schmidt
theorem [4] on groups all of whose subgroups are nilpotent.

S. S. Levischenko investigated quasibiprimary groups [3]. A soluble quasibiprimary group G
can be represented as the semidirect product [P ]M of an elementary abelian Sylow p-sub-
group P and a quasiprimary subgroup M, which is a maximal subgroup of G [3, Theo-
rem 3.1]. In an insoluble quasibiprimary group G the Frattini subgroup Φ(G) is primary [3,
Theorem 2.2], the quotient group G/Φ(G) is a simple group, and all such simple groups are
enumerated [3, Theorem 2.1].

It is natural to study the structure of quasi-k-primary groups for any positive integer k.
Most of simple groups is quasi-k-primary. Simple groups that are not quasi-k-primary are
enumerated in [5, 3.8]. It is satisﬁed the question of V. S. Monakhov in Kourovka notebook [6,
11.64].

We obtain the description of soluble quasi-k-primary groups and soluble groups with nilpo-

tent wide subgroups.

2 Preliminaries

Lemma 1. A soluble quasi-k-primary group is (k + 1)-primary.

Proof. Let G be a soluble quasi-k-primary group and M be a maximal subgroup of G.
Then |π(G)| ≥ k + 1 and |π(M)| ≤ k. In a soluble group maximal subgroups have prime
indices. Therefore

|G : M| = pα, p ∈ π(G), α ∈ N.

Since |G| = |M| · |G : M|, we have |π(G)| ≤ k + 1, and |π(G)| = k + 1. Lemma 1 is proved.

Lemma 2. If G is a soluble quasi-k-primary group and N is its normal Hall subgroup,

then G/N is a quasi-l-primary group, where l = k − |π(N)|.

Proof. By Lemma 1, G is (k + 1)-primary, hence

|π(G/N)| = |π(G)| − |π(N)| = k + 1 − |π(N)| = l + 1.

Let M/N be a maximal subgroup of G/N. Then M is a maximal subgroup of G. Therefore
|π(M)| < |π(G)|. As N is a Hall subgroup of G, we obtain

|π(M/N)| = |π(M)| − |π(N)| < |π(G)| − |π(N)| = |π(G/N)| = l + 1.

Thus G/N is (l + 1)-primary, and any maximal subgroup of G is not more than l-primary.
Consequently, G/N is quasi-l-primary. Lemma 2 is proved.

Lemma 3. ([2, IV.2.11]) If all Sylow subgroups of a group G are cyclic, then the derived

subgroup G′ is a cyclic Hall subgroup and the quotient group G/G′ is cyclic.

3 The structure of soluble quasi-k-primary groups

Theorem 1. Let G be a soluble group. Then the following statements are equivalent.

(1) G is a quasi-k-primary group.

(2) Every normal subgroup of G is a Hall subgroup.

(3) Every maximal subgroup of G is a Hall subgroup.

(4) G = [N]M , where N is a minimal normal and Sylow subgroup of G, M is a quasi-

(k − 1)-primary and maximal subgroup.

Proof. Check that (1) implies (2). Let G be a soluble quasi-k-primary group and N be a
normal subgroup of G, τ = π(G) \ π(N). Suppose that N is not a Hall subgroup of G. Since
G is a quasi-k-primary group and N is its proper subgroup, we have |π(N)| ≤ k and τ 6= ∅.
As G is a soluble group, in G there is τ -Hall subgroup M. Now, (|M|, |N|) = 1, so M ∩ N = 1
and NM = [N]M < G. But

π([N]M) = π(N) ∪ π(M) = π(N) ∪ τ = π(G), |π(G)| = k + 1,

that is, in a quasi-k-primary group G there is a proper (k + 1)-primary subgroup [N]M, a
contradiction. Thus N is a Hall subgroup of G.

Now we prove that (3) follows from (2). Assume that in a soluble group G every normal
subgroup is a Hall subgroup. Let M be a maximal subgroup and N a minimal normal subgroup
of G. Then N is a Sylow subgroup of G. If N does not belong to M, then G = NM. And
since N is abelian, N ∩ M = 1 and subgroup M is a Hall subgroup. Let N ⊆ M. Then
M/N is a maximal subgroup of G/N. It is clear that every normal subgroup of G/N is a Hall
subgroup. Then by induction M/N is a Hall subgroup of G/N. Therefore M is also a Hall
subgroup of G.

Check that (3) implies (1). Assume that every maximal subgroup of a soluble group G is
a Hall subgroup. Let M be a maximal subgroup of G and |π(G)| = k + 1. Since M is a Hall
subgroup, we have |π(M)| = |π(G)| − 1 = k, and G is a quasi-k-primary group.

Thus, (1), (2) and (3) are equivalent.

Check that (1) implies (4). Let G be a soluble quasi-k-primary group and N its minimal
normal subgroup. In view of (2), N is a Sylow p-subgroup of G. By SchurZassenhaus theo-
rem [1, Theorem 4.32], in G there is a subgroup M such that G = [N]M. Applying Lemma 1,
G is (k + 1)-primary. Hence M is k-primary. Suppose that in M there is a proper k-primary
subgroup M1. Then in G there is a proper (k + 1)-primary subgroup [N]M1, a contradiction.
Consequently, M is quasi-(k − 1)-primary.

Finely we prove that (1) follows from (4). Let G = [N]M, where N is a minimal normal
and Sylow subgroup of G, M is its quasi-(k − 1)-primary and maximal subgroup. Then by

3

Lemma 1,

|π(M)| = k, |π(G)| = |π([N]M)| = |π(N)| + |π(M)| = k + 1.

Show that every maximal subgroup K of G is not more than k-primary. If NK = G, then
N ∩ K = 1 and K ≃ M. Since M is a quasi-(k − 1)-primary soluble subgroup of G, using
Lemma 1, we obtain that M is k-primary. And so K is also a k-primary group. Assume that
NK is a proper subgroup of G. Then N ⊆ K and K = N(K ∩ M) by Dedekind identity. As
M is quasi-(k − 1)-primary, we obtain that L ∩ M is not more than (k − 1)-primary. Hence
K = [N](K ∩ M) is not more than k-primary. Thus (4) and (1) are equivalent. Theorem 1 is
proved.

Note that π-soluble groups with certain Hall maximal subgroups are investigated in [7].

Corollary 1.1. In a soluble quasi-k-primary group the Frattini subgroup is trivial.

Proof. The Frattini subgroup of any group can never be a Hall subgroup [1, Theorem 4.33].

It remains only to use Statement (2) of Theorem 1.

Corollary 1.2. In a soluble quasi-k-primary group the Fitting subgroup is a Hall subgroup

and every its Sylow subgroup is a minimal normal subgroup.

Proof. By Theorem 1 (2) the Fitting subgroup of a soluble quasi-k-primary group G is
a Hall subgroup. And so every its Sylow subgroup P is a Sylow subgroup of G. Moreover,
since the Fitting subgroup is nilpotent, P is a characteristic subgroup. Consequently, P is
normal in G. At the same time by Theorem 1 (2), a minimal normal subgroup of a soluble
quasi-k-primary group is a Sylow subgroup. Corollary 1.2 is proved.

Corollary 1.3. Let N be a normal subgroup of a group G.

If G is a soluble quasi-
k-primary group, then the quotient group G/N is a soluble quasi-l-primary group, where l =
k − |π(N)|.

Proof. It follows from Theorem 1 (2) and Lemma 2.

If a group G has a normal series whose factors are isomorphic to Sylow subgroups, then

we say G has a Sylow tower.

Corollary 1.4. A soluble quasi-k-primary group has a Sylow tower.

Proof. We use induction on k. Let G be a soluble quasi-k-primary group. Then by
Statement (2) and (4) of Theorem 1, G can be represented as G = [P1]M1, where P1 is
a minimal normal and Sylow subgroup of G, M1 is a quasi-(k − 1)-primary and maximal
subgroup. By the induction hypothesis, M1 has a Sylow tower. Hence G also has a Sylow
tower. Corollary 1.4 is proved.

A positive integer n is said to be squarefree if p2 does not divide n for all primes p. A

group is supersoluble if all its chief factors are of prime orders.

Corollary 1.5. The order of a group G is squarefree if and only if G is a supersoluble
quasi-k-primary group, where k = |π(G)| − 1. In particular, a supersoluble quasi-k-primary
group is metacyclic.

Proof. Let the order of a group G be squarefree and k = |π(G)| − 1. Then all Sylow
subgroups of G are cyclic and G is supersoluble and metacyclic by Lemma 3. It is clear that
|π(X)| < |π(G)| for every proper subgroup X of G, that is, G is quasi-k-primary.

Converse, let G be a supersoluble quasi-k-primary group. Apply induction on k. By
Theorem 1 (4), G = [N]M, where N is a minimal normal and Sylow subgroup of G, M is a
quasi-(k − 1)-primary and maximal subgroup. In view of [1, Theorem 4.48], a minimal normal
subgroup of a supersoluble group is of prime order, hence |N| = p, p ∈ π(G). A subgroup
M is supersoluble and quasi-(k − 1)-primary. By the induction hypotheses, the order of M
is squarefree. Hence the order of G is also squarefree. And so G is metacyclic by Lemma 3.
Corollary 1.5 is proved.

Corollary 1.6. The derived length of a soluble quasi-k-primary group G does not exceed

min{|π(G)|, max{1 + ai | i = 1, 2, . . . , t}},

where |F (G)| = pa1

1 pa2

2 . . . pat
t .

Proof. Let d(G) and r(G) be the derived length and the rank of a soluble quasi-k-primary
group G, respectively. By Theorem 1 (4), all Sylow subgroups of G are elementary abelian
and the length of chief series of G equals |π(G)|. Hence d(G) ≤ |π(G)|. Soluble groups
with abelian Sylow subgroups are considered in paragraph VI.14 [2]. Therefore all statements
applying to A-groups (soluble groups with abelian Sylow subgroups) of this paragraph is
In particular, d(G) ≤ 1 + r(G) by [2, VI.14.18], and
correct for quasi-k-primary groups.
r(G) ≤ u by [2, VI.14.31], where u is the maximal number of generating Sylow subgroups
in the Fitting subgroup F (G). Since Sylow subgroups of G are elementary abelian, we have
u = max{ai | i = 1, . . . , t}. It follows that

d(G) ≤ min{|π(G)|, max{1 + ai | i = 1, . . . , t}}.

Corollary 1.6 is proved.

Substituting k = 2 in Theorem 1, we obtain the result of S. S. Levischenko.

Corollary 1.7. ([3, Theorem 3.1]) A soluble group G is quasibiprimary if and only if G
is equal to the semidirect product [P ]M of its elementary abelian Sylow p-subgroup P and
quasiprimary subgroup M , which is also a maximal subgroup of G.

4 Soluble groups with nilpotent wide subgroups

Let G be a nontrivial group, Z0(G) = 1, Z1(G) = Z(G), Z2(G)/Z1(G) = Z(G/Z1(G)), . . . ,
Zi(G)/Zi−1(G) = Z(G/Zi−1(G)), . . . . Then the subgroup Z∞(G) = S∞
i=0 Zi(G) is called the
hypercenter of G.

Obviously, Z(G/Z∞(G)) = 1.

Theorem 2. If in a soluble group G every maximal subgroup M such that π(M) = π(G) is
nilpotent, then the quotient group G/Z∞(G) is quasi-k-primary, where k = |π(G/Z∞(G))|−1.

Proof. Suppose that the quotient group G = G/Z∞(G) is not quasi-k-primary, where
k = |π(G/Z∞(G))| − 1. Then in G there is a maximal subgroup M = M/Z∞(G) such that
π(M ) = π(G). Hence M is a maximal subgroup of G and π(M) = π(G). By the hypotheses,
M is nilpotent. Therefore M is also nilpotent. Since M is a maximal subgroup of a soluble
group G, we obtain that |G : M | = pα for some p ∈ π(G) and positive integer α. Let M p
be a Sylow p-subgroup of M , Gp be a Sylow p-subgroup of G containing M p. Then M p is
a proper subgroup of Gp. Therefore M p is normal in G. Now there is a nontrivial element
x of M p ∩ Z(Gp) such that it belongs to the center of G. This contradicts the fact that
Z(G/Z∞(G)) = 1. Theorem 2 is proved.

Corollary 2.1. If all wide subgroups of a group G are nilpotent, then G/Z∞(G) is quasi-

k-primary, where k = |π(G/Z∞(G))| − 1.

The converse of Theorem 2 is not true. For example, let G = S3 × Z6. Here S3 is the
symmetric group of order 3, Z6 is the cyclic group of order 6. Then Z∞(G) = Z6, and so
G/Z∞(G) ≃ S3 is quasiprimary, but the wide maximal subgroup M = S3 ×Z2 is nonnilpotent.

The following question becomes natural.

What is the structure of a ﬁnite soluble group all of whose wide subgroups are supersoluble?
