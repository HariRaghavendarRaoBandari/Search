INTRODUCTION

The Standard Model (SM) has been proven to be highly successful through many signif-

icant experimental tests, in particular the discovery of a new particle consistent with the
SM Higgs boson with a mass between 125− 126 GeV detected by the ATLAS and the CMS
experiments at the LHC [1, 2]. On the other hand, since many important questions, such

as the origin of mass, the large hierarchy between electroweak and the Planck scale, the

strong CP problem, and the matter/antimatter asymmetry remain unanswered in the SM,

we need to study physics beyond the SM. One of the ways of probing new physics beyond the

SM is to investigate the anomalous gauge boson interactions. Gauge boson self-interactions
in the SM are exactly described by the SUL(2) × UY (1) gauge symmetry. The precision
measurements of gauge boson self-interactions can further verify the SM. Furthermore, the

existence of anomalous gauge boson couplings may be a sign of new physics beyond the SM.

The eﬀective Lagrangian approach is one of the common ways for searching new physics

beyond the SM in a model independent way. In particular, the anomalous quartic gauge

boson couplings can be examined with the aid of the eﬀective Lagrangian approach. These

couplings are due to high-dimensional eﬀective operators which do not include any trilinear

gauge boson couplings. So, they can be analyzed independently from the trilinear gauge

boson couplings.

The LHC is expected to reply some of the fundamental open questions in particle physics.

Nevertheless, the analysis of the LHC data is quite diﬃcult due to remnants of the usual

proton-proton deep inelastic processes. Whereas, collisions between electrons and positrons

are much simpler to investigate than proton-proton collisions. A linear electron-positron

collider with high luminosity and energy is the best option to complement and to expand

the LHC physics program. The CLIC is one of the most popular linear colliders, purposed

to follow out electron-positron collisions at energies from 0.35 TeV to 3 TeV [3]. To have

its high luminosity and energy is quite important with regards to new physics research

beyond the SM. Since the anomalous quartic W W W W couplings deﬁning through eﬀective

Lagrangians have dimension-8, they have very strong energy dependence. Therefore, the

anomalous cross section including W W W W vertex has a higher energy than the SM cross

section. Hence, CLIC will have a great potential to examine the anomalous quartic gauge

boson couplings.

2

High-dimensional eﬀective operators describing the anomalous quartic gauge boson cou-

plings are expressed by either linear or nonlinear eﬀective Lagrangians. Nonlinear eﬀective

Lagrangians are considered if there is no Higgs boson in the low energy spectrum. However,

linear eﬀective Lagrangians are obtained by using a linear representation of gauge symmetry

that is broken by the conventional SM Higgs mechanism. It becomes important to study

the anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings based on linear eﬀective Lagrangians due to

the discovery of a Higgs boson in the LHC.

In this paper, we will analyze the anomalous quartic W W W W couplings via e+e− →
νeW −W +¯νe process with semi-leptonic decay including polarized electron (positron) beam

eﬀects at the CLIC for the center-of-mass energies of 1.4 and 3 TeV.

II. DIMENSION-EIGHT OPERATORS FOR QUARTIC GAUGE COUPLINGS

There are three classes of operators that describe the anomalous quartic couplings. The

ﬁrst class of operators can be parameterized in terms of only the covariant derivative of the

ﬁeld DµΦ. This class includes two independent operators [4]:

LS0 =

LS1 =

fS0
Λ4 [(DµΦ)†DνΦ] × [(DµΦ)†DνΦ],
fS1
Λ4 [(DµΦ)†DµΦ] × [(DνΦ)†DνΦ],

The second class of operators are related to DµΦ and the ﬁeld strength. These seven

operators are given as follows [4]

There have been many studies for the anomalous gauge self-interactions at linear and

hadron colliders [5–28]. The anomalous quartic W W W W couplings at the LHC and the fu-

ture hadron colliders have been investigated phenomenologically in Refs.[29–31]. In Ref.[29],

the sensitivity bounds are obtained only on fS0

Λ4 and fS1

Λ4 at 99% conﬁdence level (C.L.) for

√s = 14 TeV via pp → jje±µ±νν process. Similarly the sensitivity bounds on fT 0
Λ4 with 95%
C.L. via triboson production at the proton-proton colliders for √s = 14 TeV are obtained in
Ref.[30]. In Ref.[31], the fS0
Λ4 couplings have been studied via W W W ﬁnal state
with full leptonic decay and semi-leptonic decay for √s = 14 TeV at the LHC and √s = 100
TeV for future hadron collider. The best available constraints on fS0

III. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS

The important features of a linear collider are its clean experimental environment, high

energy and polarized beams. A polarized electron beam would provide suitable platform

searching of the SM and for diagnosing new physics. Observation of even the tiniest signal

which conﬂicts with the SM expectations would be a convincing evidence for physics beyond

4

the SM. Proper selections of the electron and positron beam polarizations may therefore be

used to enhance the new physics signal and also to considerably suppress backgrounds.

We use MadGraph5 [32] to generate the signal and background events with the eﬀective

Lagrangian implemented through FEYNRULES [33]. In order to develop event generating

eﬃciency, we apply the following pre-selection cuts on the ﬁnal state neutrinos, two leptons

and two jets in all of our calculations;

(1) pT j > 10 GeV, |ηj| < 5
(2) Emiss > 10 GeV (missing ET (sum of neutrino’s momenta)),
(3) |Mll − MW| < 15 GeV,
(4) |Mjj − MW| < 15 GeV,
(5) ∆R > 0.4,

where j = u, d, s, c; l = e, µ and ∆R is the angular separation between any two of the

produced particles. ∆R = p∆ϕ2 + ∆η2 with ϕ representing the azimuthal angle with

respect to the beam directions.

If the electroweak nature of the interactions of the processes are taken into account, for

a process with electron and positron beam polarizations, the cross section can be expressed

as [34],

σ =

1
4

(1 − Pe+)(1 + Pe−)σ−1+1 +

1
4

(1 + Pe+)(1 − Pe−)σ−1+1.

(19)

Here σab represents the calculated cross section with ﬁxed helicities a for positron and b

for the electron. Pe− is the electron beam and Pe+ is the positron relative polarisation. It

may be noted that the considered process includes only a weak interaction. Therefore, only

left-handed electrons (right-handed positrons) should be taken into account because of the

structure of the W e−νe (W e+ ¯νe) vertex. Hence, the left-polarized electron (right-polarized

positron) beam would enhance the cross section. This eﬀect can be seen in Figs.1-6 for
various polarization schemes. The total cross section of the e+e− → νeW −W +¯νe process
as a function of fS0
Λ4 coupling for 1.4 and 3 TeV center-of-mass energies are shown in Fig.1

anomalous fS1

and Fig.2, respectively. In Fig.3 and Fig.4 depict the total cross section depending on the
Λ4 coupling at √s =1.4 TeV and √s =3 TeV energies, respectively. The total
Λ4 coupling for the center-of-

cross sections are plotted in Fig.5 and Fig.6 with respect to fT 0

mass energies of 1.4 TeV and 3 TeV, respectively. As can be seen from Fig.1 and Fig.6, the

polarization (Pe− =-80%;Pe+ =+60%) enhances the cross sections the most compared to

5

the other considered to polarization schemes. The lowest points of the curves in Fig.1 and

Fig.6 correspond the value of the SM cross section. As seen from the ﬁgures, center-of-mass

increases nearly by a factor of 10 from the SM for fS0

energy remarkably improves the deviations from the SM. For instance, in Fig.1 cross section
Λ4 = 1×10−9 GeV−4 at 1.4 TeV. However,
Λ4 . On the

cross section increases nearly by a factor of 100 at 3 TeV for the same value for fS0

other hand, the obtained cross sections are very sensitive to the anomalous parameters. For

instance in Fig.2 cross section increases two orders of magnitude as fS1
Λ4 increases from 0 to
1 × 10−9 GeV−4. As seen from these ﬁgures, the total cross sections depend on the center
of mass energy. When the center-of-mass energies are changed from 1.4 TeV to 3 TeV, the

cross sections nearly increase by a factor of 100. The cross sections are almost symmetric

with respect to change in the sign of anomalous couplings. Therefore, main contribution

comes from the quadratic anomalous couplings terms.

In order to examine the sensitivity to the anomalous W W W W couplings, we use one

parameter χ2 criterion without systematic error. The χ2 function is deﬁned as follows,

χ2 = (cid:18) σSM − σN P

σSM δstat (cid:19)2

(20)

where σN P is the total cross section including SM and new physics, δstat = √N is the
statistical error, N is the number of background events N = LintσSM where Lint is the

integrated CLIC luminosity. We have obtained 95% C.L. limits on the anomalous coupling
parameters using this analyze method at √s = 1.4 TeV and 3 TeV for diﬀerent integrated
luminosity values and ﬁnal polarization conﬁgurations. Polarization improves the sensitivity

We observe that our limits for fS0

bound of anomalous parameters as seen from the Tables II-VII. As we expected, the best
limit are obtained for the Pe− = −80%; Pe+ = 60% polarization state.

in Table II at √s = 1.4 TeV are competitive with
[29] and one order of magnitude better than the ones reported for the
[31]. Additionally, our limits for √s = 3 TeV are at the
LHC with L = 100 fb−1 by Ref.
same order of magnitude with the LHC results for the L = 3000 fb−1 and √s = 100 TeV.
These results can be seen if Table I is compared to Table III. Similar interpretations can be

the results in Ref.

made for our bounds on fS1

Λ4 from Table IV and Table V. In addition, we see from Table VI
for √s = 1.4 TeV very close to the LHC bounds for 5σ with 300 fb−1 for
the limit on fT 0
Λ4
√s = 14 TeV. However, the bounds for √s = 100 TeV future hadron collider with L = 3000
fb−1 are better than our limits on fT 0

Λ4 as seen from Table VII.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The CLIC is a high energy collider which has TeV scale energy and very high lumi-

nosity. Particularly, operating with its high energy and luminosity is extremely impor-

tant in order to investigate the anomalous W W W W quartic couplings through the process
e+e− → νeW −W + ¯νe. Since the anomalous couplings depend on energy strongly, the cross
sections that contain these couplings would have momentum dependence than those of the

SM. We have found that the contribution of the anomalous quartic couplings to the total

cross section increases with increasing center-of-mass energy. Because of the structure of

W e−νe (W e+ ¯νe) vertex, it is found that certain polarizations of the beam increases the cross
sections. In this respect, we ﬁnd the better sensitivity for the Pe− = −80%; Pe+ = 60%
polarization state.

As a result, the CLIC with very clean experimental conditions and being free from strong

interactions with respect to LHC, high colliding energy and very high luminosity has a

potential advantage over the LHC in studying the anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings.
