Abstract

Recent studies have shown that the well established Λc(2595) resonance contains a large meson-baryon

component, which can vary depending on the speciﬁc formalism. In this work, we examine such a picture

by utilizing the compositeness condition and the large number of colors (Nc) expansion. We examine three

different models fulﬁlling two body unitarity in coupled-channels, and adopting renormalization schemes

where the mass of the Λc(2595) resonance is well described, but not necessarily its width, since we do not

consider three body channels and work at the isospin symmetric limit. Both approximations might have

an effect larger on the width than on the mass. In this context, our studies show that the compositeness of

the Λc(2595) depends on the number of considered coupled channels, and on the particular regularization

scheme adopted in the unitary approaches and, therefore, is model dependent.

In addition, we perform

an exploratory study of the Λc(2595) in the large Nc expansion, within a scheme involving only the πΣc

and KΞ′c channels, whose dynamics is mostly ﬁxed by chiral symmetry. In this context and formulating
the leading-order interaction as a function of Nc, we show that for moderate Nc > 3 values, the mass

and width of the Λc(2595) deviate from those of a genuine qqq baryon, implying the relevance of meson-

baryon components in its wave function. Furthermore, we study the properties of the Λc(2595), in the strict
Nc → ∞ limit, using an extension of the chiral Weinberg-Tomozawa interaction to an arbitrary number
of ﬂavors and colors. This latter study hints at the possible existence of a (perhaps) sub-dominant qqq

component in the Λc(2595) resonance wave function, which would become dominant when the number of

colors gets sufﬁciently large.

INTRODUCTION

In the naive quark model, mesons are made up of a quark-antiquark pair while baryons consist

of three quarks. Before 2000, most hadrons could be easily understood within such a picture, with

the exception of only a few cases, e.g., the lowest lying scalar nonet, the Λ(1405), and the Roper

resonances [1]. The situation changed dramatically in 2003 with the discovery of the X(3872)

by the BELLE collaboration [2], that was the ﬁrst of many others, so-called XY Z states, which

could not be easily accommodated into standard models of constituent quarks.

Indeed, some

of them apparently contain more than the minimum quark content dictated by the naive quark

model, such as the Zc(4430) [3] and Zc(3900) [4]. The latest Pc states discovered by the LHCb
collaboration [5] are the ﬁrst exotic states of such type in the baryonic sector. Various theoretical

interpretations of these resonances have been proposed, ranging from weakly bound molecular or

compact multi-quark states to quark-gluon hybrids. As many of these exotic states are located

close to the two- or even three-body strong decay thresholds, coupled–channel effects are widely

believed to play an important role.

Unitarized approaches and their extensions, which take into account various important con-

straints, such as chiral and heavy quark symmetries, or unitarity, provide a useful framework to

study coupled–channel effects. In certain cases, the interactions among the coupled channels can

be strong enough to generate the so-called dynamically generated states, which are customarily

referred to as molecular states as well. It is found that, somehow unexpectedly, not only the ex-

otic states, but also some states long believed to be conventional hadrons, which can be explained

by the constituent quark models, turn out to contain large hadron-hadron components. Some of

the prominent examples are the axial vector mesons [6–9] and the low-lying tensor states [8–11].

Many studies of these states in various decays and reactions have been performed and all the

results seem to be consistent with such a molecular picture.

In the heavy-ﬂavor baryon sector, the 1/2− Λc(2595) and its heavy quark symmetry (HQS)
partners have been proposed to be of molecular nature as well, although there is debate about

its most important components [12–18]. More speciﬁcally in Refs. [12, 13], it is claimed that

πΣc channel plays the dominant role, while DN is found to be the most important ingredient in
Ref. [14]. 1 After including the DN and D∗N channels, as required by heavy quark spin symmetry
(HQSS) arguments, the authors of Refs. [15, 16, 18] conclude that both of them may be needed.

1 A similar conclusion was reached in the J¨ulich meson-exchange model [19].

In principle, wave functions are not observables themselves. As a result, it is difﬁcult to pin

down the exact nature of a hadronic state. The claims regarding the largest Fock components in

hadron wave functions are often model dependent. In recent years, the compositeness condition,

ﬁrst proposed by Weinberg to explain the deuteron as a neutron-proton bound state [20, 21], has

been advocated as a model independent way to determine the relevance of hadron-hadron com-

ponents in a molecular state. With renewed interests in hadron spectroscopy, this method has

been extended to more deeply bound states, resonances, and higher partial waves [22–35]. For

the particular case of the Λc(2595), the situation is a bit unclear. For instance, it was shown in
Ref. [36] that the Λc(2595) is not predominantly a πΣc molecular state using the effective range
expansion. A similar conclusion was reached in Ref. [37], using a generalized effective range

expansion including Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson pole contributions. In this latter work, the effects of

isospin breaking corrections are also taken into account and the extended compositeness condition

for resonances developed in Ref. [38] has been applied to calculate the compositeness coefﬁcients.

Furthermore, although in the unitary approaches [12–16, 18] the Λc(2595) is found to be of molec-
ular nature, there is no general agreement on its dominant meson-baryon components yet.

Another approach 2 to probe the dominant component of a hadronic state is to study the Nc
dependence of the poles associated to resonances that appear in the unitarized meson-meson [45–

54] or meson-baryon [55–58] scattering amplitudes, being Nc the number of colors of quarks. The
1/Nc expansion [59–64] is valid for the whole energy region and makes speciﬁc predictions for q ¯q
and qqq states. A genuine q ¯q state becomes bound as Nc → ∞ with its mass scaling as O(1) and
its width as O(1/Nc). Mesonic states of other nature may show different behavior [65]. The mass
of a generic qqq state with two or three ﬂavors evolves as O(Nc) while its width scales as O(1) at
leading order [60, 66, 67].

In the present work, we utilize both the compositeness condition and the large Nc behaviour to
examine the nature of the Λc(2595) aiming to test the molecular scenario. This paper is organized
as follows. In Sect. II, we brieﬂy introduce the unitarized models used in Refs. [12, 15, 18].

In Sect.

III, we discuss the compositeness condition and, in particular, the effects due to the

number of coupled channels considered and to the speciﬁc regularization scheme adopted.

In

Sect. IV, we formulate the large Nc expansion within the model of Ref. [12], and show that in
this scheme, and for a moderately large number of colors, the Nc dependence of the Λc(2595)

2 In recent years, it has been stressed that the quark mass dependence of a hadronic state, which can be accessed by

present lattice QCD simulations, can also be used to distinguish its nature. In the present work, we are not going to

approach the problem from this perspective. Interested readers can see, e.g., Refs. [39–44] and references therein.

mass and width deviates from that of a genuine qqq state. We will also discuss the Nc ≫ 3
behavior of the Λc(2595) pole position within the dynamical model established in [15], using the
ﬁndings of Refs. [55, 56], where the chiral Weinberg-Tomozawa (WT) interaction is extended to

an arbitrary number of ﬂavors and colors. This latter study hints at the possible existence of a

(perhaps) sub-dominant qqq component in the Λc(2595) resonance wave function, which would
become dominant when the number of colors gets sufﬁciently large. Finally, the most relevant

conclusions of this work are collected in Sect. V.

II. UNITARIZED APPROACHES

The key ingredients of unitary approaches are kernel potentials and the procedures adopted

to restore exact two-body unitarity in coupled channels. In practice, the kernel potentials, which

represent the strong interactions among the participating hadrons, are generally constructed us-

ing either effective ﬁeld theories, such as chiral perturbation theory, or phenomenological La-

grangians, such as the hidden gauge ones. Symmetry arguments play an important role in con-

structing the potentials and in ﬁxing the unknown parameters. All of the unitarization procedures

respect coupled–channel two-body unitarity above thresholds, but may differ in their treatment of

off-shell, left-hand cut effects, etc., which, in most cases, induce sub-dominant corrections that

are partially accounted for by the undetermined low energy constants. In the present work, we

focus on the Bethe-Salpeter equation method based on the so-called on-shell approximation [68–

70]. For a discussion of the off-shell effects, see, e.g., Refs. [71, 72] and Ref. [73]. In the latter

reference, the off-shell effects are explicitly demonstrated to be small.

The Bethe-Salpeter equation reads, symbolically,

Tij = Vij + (V GT )ij,

(1)

where i, j denote the channel index, V is the kernel potential, T stands for the unitarized amplitude,

and G is the two-point one-loop function.

In the study of the Λc(2595), the relevant kernel potentials V have been explicitly calculated
in the framework of chiral [12] and the extended hidden gauge [18] Lagrangians, and in the
SU(6)×HQSS model of Ref. [15]. They differ in the number of included coupled channels and
how chiral symmetry and HQSS are taken into account. We refer to Refs. [12, 15, 16, 18] for more
details. (A brief revision of the SU(6)×HQSS model is presented in Subsect. IV C 2).

5

In addition to the potential, the loop function G in the Bethe-Salpeter equation also plays an

important role. It has the following simple form in 4 dimensions:

G = iZ

d4q
(2π)4

2M

[(P − q)2 − m2 + iǫ][q2 − M 2 + iǫ]

,

(2)

with M and m the baryon and meson masses, respectively. This loop function is logarithmically

divergent and needs to be properly regularized. Two different methods can be found in the litera-

ture: the dimensional regularization scheme and the other in which an ultra-violet hard cut-off is

used. In the modiﬁed minimal subtraction scheme, the loop function reads

GM S(s, M 2, m2) =

(3)

where s is the invariant mass squared of the meson-baryon system. To take into account non-
perturbative effects, the constant −2 in the above equation is often replaced by the so-called sub-
traction constant a, which can be slightly ﬁne-tuned to achieve better agreement with experimental

0, the unitarized amplitude reduces to that of
0) = 0. This has been referred to as the naturalness requirement [14]. In
the following, we refer to this regularization method as “DR-naturalness.” It should be noted that

the tree level, such as G(µ2

this is the method adopted in Refs. [14, 15].

In Ref. [41], a so-called HQS inspired regularization scheme has been suggested, which is man-

ifestly consistent with both the chiral power counting and heavy-quark spin-ﬂavor (SF) symmetry,

up to ΛQCD/MH corrections, where MH is a generic heavy-hadron mass. In this scheme, referred
to as “DR-HQS” in the present work, the loop function G reads:

GHQS = GM S −

2 ˚M

16π2 log  ˚M 2

µ2 ! − 2! +

2msub

16π2  log  ˚M 2

µ2 ! + a! ,

(4)

where msub is a generic pseudoscalar meson mass, which can take the value of mπ in the u, d
ﬂavor case or an average of the pion, kaon, and eta masses in the u, d, and s three ﬂavor case. ˚M
is the chiral limit value of the charmed or bottom baryon masses. The apparent renormalization

scale dependence originates from that of the dimensional regularization and has little to do with

6

the“HQS” description (for more details, please see Ref. [12]). Note that in the present case, this

scheme is equivalent to the modiﬁed minimal subtraction one discussed above. In the numeri-
cal calculations, we use ˚M = 2.5349 GeV, which is the average of the sextet charmed baryon
masses, msub = 0.368 GeV, average of the masses of the pseudoscalar mesons, and µ = 1 GeV.
In principle, one could use a different value for ˚M in the light baryon sector, but this would be
equivalent to the use of different subtraction constants for different channels, which we would like

to avoid. Natural values for the subtraction constant, considering the range of baryon masses (i.e.,
˚M) involved in the present study, lie in the [−6,−2] interval, using a = −2 as a reference in the
modiﬁed minimal subtraction scheme.

The loop function can also be regularized with an ultra-violet hard cutoff, Λ, i.e.,

Gcut =Z Λ

0

q2 dq
2π2

EM + Em
2EM Em

2M

s − (EM + Em)2 + iǫ

,

(5)

with EM =pq2 + M 2, and Em =pq2 + m2. Taking into account the typical size of the hadrons,

values around 1 GeV are natural for Λ, although its exact value is in most cases determined from

a ﬁt to data.

One of the main objectives of this work is, using potentials constructed in different frame-

works [12, 15, 18], to study how the so-called compositeness or the dominance of a certain channel

varies with the scheme adopted to regularize the loop function G.

III. THE COMPOSITENESS CONDITION

As mentioned previously, the compositeness analysis proposed by Weinberg in Refs. [20, 21]

is only valid for bound states. For resonances, it involves complex numbers and, therefore, a

strict probabilistic interpretation is lost. The generalization of the compositeness study for reso-

nances has been put forward by different groups. The weight of a hadron-hadron component in a

composite particle is deﬁned as [29]

and it is related to the probability of ﬁnding the state in the channel i. For resonances, ˜Xi is still
related to the squared wave function of the channel i, in a phase prescription that automatically

renders the wave function real for bound states [29], and so it might still be used as a measure of

the weight of that hadron-hadron channel in the composition of the resonant state [29, 33].

The deviation of the sum of Xi from unity is related to the energy dependence of the s-wave

˜Xi and ˜Z must cancel. The ﬁeld renormalization constant ˜Z itself
is well-deﬁned even for resonances, since it corresponds to the residue of the renormalized two-
point function [31]. Thus, there is no fundamental problem in calculating ˜Z using Eq. (10), but the
probabilistic interpretation of the obtained result is not straightforward. The ﬁeld renormalization
constant ˜Z measures the effect of the elementary contribution as the deviation from unity, and it is
in general a complex number. Therefore one should be aware that ˜Z can not directly be interpreted
as the “probability” of the elementary component [32]. Conversely, strictly speaking, ˜Xi cannot be
interpreted as a probability of ﬁnding a two-body component. Nevertheless, because it represents
the contribution of the channel wave function to the total normalization, the compositeness ˜Xi will
have an important piece of information on the structure of the resonance. In general, however, all
˜Xi and ˜Z can be arbitrary complex numbers constrained by Eq. (11). The probabilistic interpre-
tation of the structure of a resonance from ˜Xi and ˜Z is not possible when the imaginary parts are
˜Xi and ˜Z to meet the
sum rule of Eq. (11), but with one of them exceeding the unity. T. Hyodo, following the ideas of

sizable [33] or when there is a large cancellation among the real parts ofPi

T. Berggren [74] in the seventies, has proposed to look at the parameter P , deﬁned as

P = | ˜Z| +(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Xi

˜Xi(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) − 1 = | ˜Z| + |1 − ˜Z| − 1 =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
and try to give a “probabilistic” interpretation to ˜Z and Pi
In the picture advocated in Ref. [29] imaginary parts are neglected. The quantity 1− Z is taken
to represent the compositeness of the hadronic state in terms of all the considered channels, and Z

˜Xi only for those cases where P is

˜Xi(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) − 1,

much smaller than 1/2 [75].

(12)

1 −Xi

˜Xi(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

+(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Xi

is referred to as its elementariness. Within this picture, a non-vanishing Z takes into account that

ultimately the model is an effective one. The energy dependent interaction effectively accounts
for other possible interaction mechanisms not explicitly included in the s−wave hadron-hadron
description. These could be other hadron-hadron interactions, or even genuine hadron components

not of the molecular type (hence the appellative elementariness). Thus, a small value of Z indicates
that the state is well described by the contributions explicitly considered, namely, s−wave hadron-
hadron channels. Conversely, a large value of Z indicates that, for that state, signiﬁcant pieces of

9

information are missing in the model, and this information is being included through an effective

interaction, to the extent that the experimental hadronic properties are reproduced by the model.

However, it is not clear how to interpret Z obtained from the smooth energy dependence of the

chiral potential V [30]. In addition, it should be emphasized that, for processes involving short
distances, it is the wave function at the origin that matters (giGi for the s wave) [25, 76]3.

On the other hand, in Ref. [38], it was claimed that one can formulate a meaningful compos-

iteness relation with only positive coefﬁcients thanks to a suitable unitary transformation of the S
matrix. This in practice amounts to take the absolute value of ˜Xi in Eq. (7) to quantify the prob-
ability of ﬁnding a speciﬁc component in the wave function of a hadron. Notice that the recipe

advocated in Ref. [38] is not applicable to all types of poles. In particular the arguments of this

reference exclude the case of virtual states or resonant signals which are an admixture between

a pole and an enhanced cusp effect by the pole itself. More speciﬁcally, the probabilistic inter-

pretation given in [38] to | ˜Xi| is only valid when √Res0 > Mi,th, with Mi,th the corresponding

threshold of the ith channel 4.

In what follows, we will examine how the number of coupled channels and the particular reg-

ularization scheme affect the predicted (calculated) compositeness of the Λc(2595). For such a
purpose, we ﬁrst ﬁx the number of coupled channels and therefore the kernel potentials, and then

compare the resulting compositeness coefﬁcients. The meson and baryon masses employed in the

numerical analysis are the same as those used in Ref. [35] and are compiled here in Table I.

According to the PDG, the Λc(2595) has a mass of 2592.25±0.28 MeV and a width of 2.6±0.6
MeV [1]. Therefore, the only parameter in each of the three regularization schemes discussed in

Sect. II is ﬁxed in such a way that the mass of the Λc(2595) is reproduced. We do not attempt to
ﬁx the width because we only consider here two-body coupled channels and work at the isospin

symmetric limit, both approximations can have an effect larger on the width than on the mass (see

an elaborate discussion in Ref. [37]).

3 For an extensive discussion on this issue, see Ref. [30], where it was concluded that to judge the relevance of each

channel one has to study different physical processes.

4 In this situation the convergence region of the Laurent series of the S matrix around the pole incorporates some
intervals of the physical real axis around the pole mass MR (≡ √Res0), and in these circumstances it follows
| ˜Xi| ≤ 1. Actually, it can be proved thatPi | ˜Xi| ≤ 1, where the sum is only over the channels fulﬁlling √Res0 >
Mi,th [38]. Thus, the so-called effective elementariness is then deﬁned as 1 −Pi | ˜Xi|, which accounts for the

contributions of the heavier channels that do not enter into the sum.

10

A. Sixteen channels

First, we consider the sixteen channels considered in Refs. [15, 16], making also use of the
kernel potentials provided by the SU(6)×HQSS model derived in these references, and exam-
ine the dependence of the compositeness condition on the renormalization/regularization scheme

employed to render the loop function ultraviolet-ﬁnite.

The SU(6)×HQSS model used in Refs. [15, 16] is basically a SU(8) SF extension5 of the SU(3)
chiral WT leading order meson-baryon interaction term, including ground state vector meson and

J P = 3/2+ baryon degrees of freedom. This is actually strictly correct only when coupled chan-
nels involving cc¯c components (e.g., doubly charmed baryons and ¯D(∗) antimesons) are neglected
as done in Refs. [15, 16]. These channels are OZI disconnected from those involving just one

heavy quark. Note that in the heavy-quark limit, the OZI rule becomes exact because the number

of charm quarks and the number of charm antiquarks are separately conserved. (For a more de-

tailed discussion see Ref. [77]). In this framework, there appear two Λc(2595) states, resemblance
of the two Λ(1405) resonances found in chiral unitarity approaches, with one of them narrower

than the other [15, 16].

To make a reliable comparison, we adjust the only parameter in each of the regularization

schemes discussed above to ﬁx the real part of the narrower pole to the Λc(2595) resonance mass
quoted in the PDG [1]. This yields the following parameters, α = 0.97952 for the DR-naturalness
scheme6, qmax = 0.67898 GeV for the cutoff scheme, and a = −3.37865 for the DR-HQS scheme.
Compositeness results for the Λc(2595) and its broader partner are shown in Tables II and III,
respectively. Among the 16 coupled channels, in general the most relevant ones are πΣc, DN and
D∗N. In the case of the narrow state (Table II) and for the DR-naturalness scheme, the ﬁrst of
these channels is suppressed, and the dominant components turn out to be DN and D∗N.

For the sibling state of the Λc(2595), it seems that the πΣc channel plays the dominant role, ex-
cept in the cutoff scheme, where it appears as a bound state and DN and D∗N channels are more
important. For the state that we assign to the Λc(2595), different regularization schemes yield
somehow different results. The D∗N channel plays a leading role in the DR-naturalness scheme
of Refs. [15, 16]. In the cutoff scheme, πΣc is the dominant channel, with D∗N the next compo-
nent in importance. In the DR-HQS scheme, all three mentioned channels seem to be similarly
5 This corresponds to treating the eight states of a quark (u, d, s or c with spin up, ↑ , or down, ↓ ) as equivalent,
and leads to the invariance group SU(8). Because SU(8) SF symmetry is strongly broken in nature, mass and weak

decay constant breaking effects are taken into account in Refs. [15, 16].
6 This is deﬁned for instance in Eq. (17) of Ref. [15]. 11

important, with a large imaginary part for ˜XπΣc. On the other hand, when interpreting the com-
positeness using the prescription of Ref. [38], we ﬁnd that the weights of πΣc inside the Λc(2595)
are 0.11, 0.71 and 0.97 for the DR-naturalness, cutoff and DR-HQS schemes, respectively. Since

the DN, D∗N and other heavier channels do not meet the criterion of Ref. [38], no deﬁnite con-
clusions can be made separately for each of these channels. Besides, 1 − | ˜XπΣc| would be the
effective elementariness, which get contributions from all of the other heavier channels. Similar

conclusions can be also made for the broader state in Table III.

We pay now attention to the uncertainty parameter introduced in Eq. (12). It is signiﬁcantly

smaller than 1/2, which allows for an approximate “probabilistic” interpretation of Xi and Z as
advocated in Ref. [29], only in the DR-naturalness and cutoff schemes for the Λc(2595) and its
broader partner, respectively. With larger uncertainties, the DR-HQS scheme for both resonances

and the DR-naturalness one for the wider state might also allow for an approximate “probabilistic”

interpretation of the results obtained for the different components.

Thus we see the regularization scheme plays a relevant role in the compositeness even with the

same number of coupled channels and identical kernel potentials. In other words, the so-called

compositeness used in the present way cannot be taken as a model-independent quantity. This is
not a surprise, but it reﬂects the scheme-dependent nature of the ﬁeld renormalization constant, ˜Z.
Similar conclusions have also been reached in Refs. [32, 34].

To ﬁnish this subsection, we should note that in the present approach, we have only ﬁtted
the mass of the Λc(2595), while the compositeness coefﬁcients ˜Xi in Eq. (7) depend also on the
couplings, which are in turn related to the width. Note that except in the naturalness scheme,

the predicted width for the Λc(2595) turns out to be much larger than its experimental value. A
dedicated study including the isospin breaking effects, together with other channels, may provide

further insight into the problem (see, e.g., Ref. [37]), which is however beyond the scope of the

present study.

B. Two channels

In the unitarized chiral approach of Ref. [12], the Λc(2595) resonance is dynamically generated
from the coupled–channel interaction between only the πΣc and KΞ′c meson-baryon pairs. As
shown in Table IV, all three regularization schemes considered in this work yield consistent values

for the compositeness coefﬁcients, although all with large imaginary parts and leading to values

Similar conclusions are drawn in the single channel case, πΣc, independently of the value used

for the decay constant.

C. Three channels

In the local hidden gauge approach of Ref. [18], three channels are considered, namely πΣc,
DN, and ηΛc. Taking the kernel potentials from Ref. [18], we calculate the compositeness coef-
ﬁcients ˜Xi using the three regularization schemes introduced in the previous subsections. Results
are shown in Table V. We can see that in the DR-naturalness scheme, the DN channel dominates,
while in the DR-HQS method, the πΣc component is the most signiﬁcant. The renormalization
method has an important impact on the compositeness coefﬁcients, despite all renormalization

constants have been adjusted to reproduce the mass of the Λc resonance.

We would like to make a further remark here. In the DR-naturalness scheme, the considera-

tion of the DN channel has led to a value for α quite close to 1, and an uncertainty parameter

P [Eq. (12)] very small, enabling for a “probabilistic” interpretation. Note that, however, the

0.67535 GeV, and a = −5.6365 in the DR-naturalness, cutoff and DR-HQS schemes, respectively.

P−values obtained in the other two renormalization schemes are larger than 1/2, since in both
cases the imaginary parts ofPi

˜Xi are much larger than the real ones.

IV. LARGE Nc EVOLUTION

The Nc counting rules for ordinary qqq baryons lead to scaling laws ΓR ∼ O(1), MR ∼ O(Nc)
and △E ≡ MR − MB − m ∼ O(1), with MB(m) the ground-state baryon (meson) mass, for the
resonance decay width, mass and excitation energy, respectively [60, 66, 67]. For an ordinary q ¯q
state, its mass, width and decay constant scale as O(1), O(1/Nc) and O(√Nc), respectively. For
dynamically generated states, the Nc−evolution can deviate strongly from such a scenario [45, 47,
50, 53, 54]. Compared to the dynamically generated mesons, a study of dynamically generated

baryonic states is complicated because baryon ﬂavor representations change with Nc, when the
number of ﬂavors is larger than two [78–80]. Such corrections have been taken into account in

the SU(3) chiral study of the Λ(1405) in Refs. [57, 58], as well as in the study of negative parity
s-wave resonances carried out in [55, 56], where a SU(2NF ) SF extension of the chiral SU(3) WT
interaction for an arbitrary number of ﬂavors and colors is derived. In the present exploratory work

16

on the Λc(2595), we will present Nc > 3 results for the chiral two coupled–channel scenario [12],
and only in the strict Nc → ∞ limit, in the case of the SU(6)×HQSS model [15, 16].

To obtain the large Nc evolution of the dynamically generated states in unitarized approaches,
one needs to know how the masses of the interacting hadrons, the two body loop function, and

the interactions evolve as a function of Nc. The latter evolution is partially a consequence of the
change of the ﬂavor representation of the baryons. In what follows, we examine the Nc dependence
of all these inputs.

A. Baryon and meson masses

Ground-state heavy ﬂavor baryon masses in the 1/mQ and 1/Nc expansions have been studied

in Refs. [81–83]. Up to leading order in 1/Nc, one has

Mi = mQ + M0

Nc
3

+ δi,

(13)

where mQ is the Nc independent heavy quark mass, M0/3 the contribution of the light u, d, s
quarks, and δi the ﬂavor SU(3) breaking contributions. For the present study, we take mQ = mc =
1.275 GeV, M0 ∼ 0.9 GeV, and δi is chosen such that Mi equals to its physical value for Nc = 3.
The pseudoscalar meson masses scale as O(1) and are taken as constants, while the pseudoscalar
decay constant scales as O(√Nc), namely,
f (Nc) = f0rNc

f0 = f (Nc = 3).

(14)

,

B. Loop function

As already mentioned, the meson-baryon loop function in Eq. (2) is logarithmically divergent

and should be regularized. For that purpose in this work we have used either the dimensional

regularization method or have included a momentum cutoff to render the ultraviolet contributions

ﬁnite. This latter scheme, Eq. (5), is particularly useful, because its extension to arbitrary Nc might
be more transparent.

For Nc = 3, the cutoff takes values of the order of 1 GeV. Although the Nc behavior of the cutoff
is not known from QCD, it is, however, clear that within the chiral approach used in Ref. [12], it

cannot grow faster than the cutoff of the effective theory itself, which is of the order of the scale

17

of symmetry breaking Λχ ∼ 4πf. Otherwise, we would have the absurd situation that we can
extend the validity of the loop integral beyond the applicability of the theory. Therefore, a natural
integral cutoff, as is the case here, could scale as √Nc, but not faster [49]. We will also consider
the possibility that the cutoff may scale slower than √Nc, since it would be O(1), if it were

determined by the existence of heavier qqq states, which cannot be generated from low-energy

baryon-meson dynamics, and therefore have been integrated out. We will present results for both

scenarios, which yield consistent conclusions, as it will be shown below.

In the dimensional regularization scheme, the mayor problem arises from the unknown Nc
dependence of the subtraction constant, a. However, in the DR-naturalness scheme, it is given in

terms of the meson and baryon masses [14, 15], which in turn ﬁx the full dependence of the loop

function on Nc. This scheme was employed in Ref. [55] to study the properties of the negative
parity s-wave resonances in the large Nc limit, starting from a SU(6) spin–light ﬂavor extension
of the chiral WT interaction for Nc = 3. Indeed, some expressions given in that reference were
more general, and can be applied to the SU(2NF ) group symmetry for an arbitrary Nc. We will
take advantage of these ﬁndings and will use the framework set up in Refs. [55, 56] to discuss the
strict Nc → ∞ limit of the SU(6)×HQSS model used in Refs. [15, 16].

C. Nc dependence of the meson-baryon interaction

1. KΞ′c − πΣc chiral interaction

In the unitary approach of Ref. [12], the Λc(2595) resonance is dynamically generated from
the chiral interaction between the pseudoscalar octet of Goldstone bosons and the sextet (Σc, Ξ′c)
of charmed baryons7. In the strangenessless (S = 0) isoscalar (I = 0) sector the interaction

reads [12]

V I=0,S=0(s) =

C I=0,S=0

4f 2

(Em + E′m),

(15)

7 In the heavy quark limit, the spin-parity of the light degrees of freedom in these baryons is 1+.

18

with Em and E′m the center of mass energies of the initial and ﬁnal mesons, respectively and the
coupled–channel matrix is given by

In the SU(3) group theory language we have:

(16)

(17)

Although the decomposition involves four SU(3) irreducible representations, only the 3 and 15

appear in the I = 0, S = 0 sector. Thus, the coupled–channel matrix C I=0,S=0 becomes diagonal

in the(cid:8)|3; I = 0, S = 0i,|15; I = 0, S = 0i(cid:9) SU(3) basis. The meson-baryon and the SU(3) bases

are related by means of an orthogonal matrix U obtained from the appropriate SU(3) Clebsch-

Gordan coefﬁcients [84]

While in the meson sector, the ﬂavor representation remains the same with the increase of Nc, the
situation in the baryon sector is more complicated because of the nontrivial variation of the ﬂavor

representation of the baryons with Nc, when the number of ﬂavors is larger than 2 [78, 79]. We use
the notation [p, q] for an irreducible representation of SU(3), whose corresponding Young tableau

has p + q and q boxes in the ﬁrst and second rows, respectively. To extend the irreducible ﬂavor
representation from Nc = 3 to arbitrary Nc, we adopt the prescription 8

[p, q] → [p, q +

Nc − 3

2

],

(20)

8 There are two other alternative ways to perform the extension. The one used in the present work, referred to as the

standard one in Ref. [79], has the advantage of keeping the spin, isospin, strangeness and charm quantum numbers

of the original representation at Nc = 3, while the baryons have different charge and hypercharge from those at

Nc = 3.

19

For arbitrary Nc, the 6, 3, and 15 irreducible representations become (we use the notation that an
Nc−representation “R” reduces to R at Nc = 3 [78–80]),

].

From group theory the SU(3) basis coupling strengths (eigenvalues) for arbitrary Nc turn out to be
(see Table III of Ref. [85]):



(22)

which reduces to Eq. (19) at Nc = 3. Note that the “15” eigenvalue becomes repulsive for Nc > 5,
while the interaction in the “3” subspace is always attractive and independent of Nc, besides the
scaling of the decay constant and masses in Eq. (15).

The transformation matrix U will now depend on Nc as well.

It can be obtained from the

appropriate Nc dependent SU(3) Clebsch-Gordan coefﬁcients. Using the recursion relations of
Ref. [86] or the results of Ref. [87], one can easily obtain the explicit form of U(Nc) for the
decomposition 8 ⊗ “6” = “3” ⊕ “15” ⊕ “6” ⊕ “24”.

Following the usual convention, the SU(3) Clebsch-Gordan (CG) coefﬁcients can be expressed

as the products of isoscalar factors and ordinary SU(2) CGCs.

where the label R indicates the SU(3) representation, which can be denoted using the usual weight

diagram notation (λ, µ), and γ labels degenerate representations occurring in a given product.

With the formula given in Table 4 of Ref. [87], the transformation matrix U can be obtained

straightforwardly. The ﬁrst element, for instance, should be

with

U11 =s(p + 1)(λ − 1 − p)q(λ + µ + 1 − q)(λ + µ + 2 − q)

and Y is related with the ǫ of Ref. [87] via Y = −ǫ/3. For the present case, Y = (Nc − 1)/3
and I = 0. (λ′, µ′) refer to the representation labeled by “¯3” and “ ¯15” and their values are given
in Eq. (21). Keeping in mind that the formula above is used to calculate the isoscalar factors of
“6” ⊗ 8, an extra step is needed to obtain the U matrix for 8 ⊗ “6”. Finally, the U matrix can be
written as

U(Nc) =


5+Nc

−q 2
−q 3+Nc

5+Nc −q 3+Nc
5+Nc q 2



.

(26)

With all these ingredients, we ﬁnally obtain the KΞ′c − πΣc coupled–channel interaction for an

arbitrary number of colors Nc

(27)

It is interesting to note that the πΣc → πΣc interaction is attractive and does not change with Nc,
while the KΞ′c self-interaction, which is attractive at Nc = 3, becomes repulsive for Nc > 7. On
the other hand, the strength of the off-diagonal transition increases with Nc.

2.

SU(6)×HQSS

To better understand the Nc ≫ 1 limit of the SU(6)×HQSS model, we need to give some
further details on its main features. The 16 coupled–channel model implemented in Refs. [15, 16]

has its origin in the compatibility between SF and chiral symmetries, which implies that the WT

interaction can be extended to enjoy SF invariance [SU(2NF )]. Actually this can be done in a
unique way, as it was demonstrated in [88]. The model respects SF symmetry in the light sector

and HQSS in the heavy one, and it reduces to SU(3) WT in the light sector respecting chiral

symmetry. HQSS connects vector and pseudoscalar mesons containing charmed quarks. On the

other hand, chiral symmetry ﬁxes the lowest-order interaction between Goldstone bosons and other

hadrons in a model-independent way; this is the WT interaction.

As required by SF symmetry, the model of Refs. [15, 16] incorporates ground state vector

meson and J P = 3/2+ baryon degrees of freedom, in addition to the ground state pseudoscalar
mesons and J P = 1/2+ baryons. In the large Nc limit, SF becomes exact for the baryon sec-
tor [89]. As for mesons, the lowest-lying states can also be classiﬁed quite naturally according to

21

SF multiplets. Though for charmed mesons SF symmetry reduces to HQSS, the symmetry works

worse for the light meson spectrum.

SF guarantees HQSS except when there are simultaneously c quarks and ¯c antiquarks. This is

because SF implies invariance under equal rotations for c and ¯c, but HQSS also requires invariance

when the two spin rotations are different. Thus, SF does not guaranty HQSS in sectors with hidden

charm, regardless of whether they have net charm or not. As mentioned in Subsect. III A, in the

study of the C(charm) = 1 sector carried out in Refs. [15, 16] the WT SU(8) interaction kernel

was modiﬁed, besides using physical masses and weak decay constants, by neglecting the hidden

charm cc¯c channels to accomplish HQSS. The model was quite successful and it naturally led to the
dynamical generation of the J P = 1/2− Λc(2595) and J P = 3/2− Λc(2625) resonances, among
others. Moreover, it could be used to classify the predicted states in SU(6)×HQSS multiplets [16].
Its extension to the bottom sector [17] easily accommodated two narrow baryon resonances with

beauty recently observed by the LHCb Collaboration [90], that should be intimately related to the

charmed Λc(2595) and Λc(2625) states.

We do not have the mathematical tools to extend the SU(6)×HQSS model to an arbitrary num-
ber of colors, and this is beyond the scope of this work. However, some results for the SU(2NF )
WT interaction and an arbitrary number of colors were obtained in Refs. [55, 56]. The SU(2NF )
WT interaction for each JISC sector9 reads as that in Eq. (15), but replacing the coupled–channel
matrix there by the appropriate one, C JISC, in each sector. Thus for instance, in the Λc(2595)
sector, the dimension of the coupled–channel space is 21: the sixteen channels enumerated in
Tables II and III plus the hidden charm channels, Λcηc, ΛcJ/Ψ, Ξcc ¯D, Ξcc ¯D∗ and Ξ∗cc
¯D∗. These
latter ﬁve channels were neglected in Refs. [15, 16] to restore HQSS symmetry. As discussed in
Refs. [15, 16] , the SU(8) group reduction10

63 ⊗ 120 = 120 ⊕ 168 ⊕ 2520 ⊕ 4752 ,

(28)

shows that in the SU(8) basis, there exist only four eigenvalues, associated to each of the irre-

ducible representations that appear on the right hand side of Eq. (28). (Note that the SU(4) 15-plet
of pseudoscalar (Ds, D, K, π, η, ηc, ¯K, ¯D, ¯Ds) and the 16-plet of vector (D∗s, D∗, K∗, ρ, ω, J/Ψ, ¯K∗,
9 Here J stands for the total spin of the meson-baryon pair, and for NF > 4, additional ﬂavor quantum numbers

would need to be speciﬁed.

10 For any NF , there always appears four irreducible representations in the group reduction of Eq. (28). Obviously, the

dimensions of them, as well as those of the representations where ground state baryons and mesons are included

depend on NF . These latter ones are always the adjoint and the three quark fully symmetric representations,

respectively.

TABLE VI. Dimensions (D) and WT eigenvalues (λD) associated to the SU(2NF ) irreducible representa-

tions that appear in the group decomposition that generalizes Eq. (28) [NF = 4 and Nc = 3], for arbitrary

number of ﬂavors and colors. It corresponds to the reduction of the product of the SU(8) adjoint (mesons)
and the Nc−quark fully symmetric (baryons) representations (see Eq. (27) of Ref. [55]). Note also a mis-
print in the expression given in Ref. [56] for the dimension of the “2520” representation.

¯D∗, ¯D∗s, φ) mesons are placed in the 63 representation. The lowest–lying baryons are assigned to
the 120 of SU(8). This is appropriate because in the light sector it can accommodate an octet of

spin–1/2 baryons and a decuplet of spin–3/2 baryons which are precisely the SU(3)–spin combi-

nations of the low–lying baryon states (N, Σ, Λ, Ξ and ∆, Σ∗, Ξ∗, Ω). The remaining states in the
20J=1/2 and 20′J=3/2 are completed with the charmed baryons: Λc, Σc, Ξc, Ξ′c ,Ωc, Ξcc, Ωcc and
Σ∗c, Ξ∗c, Ω∗c, Ω∗cc, Ξ∗cc, Ωccc, respectively.

The eigenvalues associated to the decomposition of Eq. (28) were calculated in [55, 56], for an

arbitrary number of colors and not only for SU(8), but for SU(2NF ) in general, and are compiled
here in Table VI. Independently of Nc, in the group reduction that generalizes Eq. (28), there only
appear four irreducible representations [55]. For four ﬂavors, the Λc(2595) state belongs to the
attractive 168 representation [16], whose attraction linearly grows with Nc. In this subspace, and
keeping in mind the 1/f 2 factor, the WT is always attractive and it scales as O(1), in the large Nc
limit. However in the subspaces associated to the other three representations, the WT interaction
is either repulsive or suppressed, O(1/Nc), when Nc ≫ 3.

In the SU(8) basis, the coupled–channel interaction matrix C JISC

SU(2NF ) is diagonal, however we
do not know, for arbitrary Nc, the orthogonal matrix USU(8)(Nc) that would transform this diagonal
matrix into C JISC, the matrix expressed in the meson–baryon basis. It would be obtained from

23

the appropriate Nc dependent SU(8) Clebsch-Gordan coefﬁcients11. This prevents us to obtain the
evolution of the Λc(2595) pole for moderate values of Nc > 3, but however as we will discuss in
the next subsection, we will be able to address its behavior for Nc ≫ 3, where we could consider
the loop function diagonal in the meson-baryon basis, as it was done in Ref. [55].

D. Λc(2595) mass and width for large Nc

From the ﬁndings of the previous subsections it is straightforward to study the Nc dependence
of the Λc(2595) mass and width, when it is dynamically generated from the coupled–channel
KΞ′c − πΣc chiral interaction. We use an ultraviolet cutoff to renormalize the loop function, and

11 These coefﬁcients can be found in Ref. [84] only for the Nc = 3 case.

examine two different Nc scaling laws, O(pNc/3) or O(1), for this parameter of the effective

theory.

Results are displayed in Figs. 1 and 2, where imaginary and real parts of the Λc(2595) pole po-
sition, together with the expected behavior of a conventional qqq baryon, are shown as a function
of Nc. We pay attention to moderately large number of colors, up to Nc = 25. For both scaling
laws of the cutoff, we ﬁnd that both mass and width of the resonance grow with Nc, more rapidly
when the cutoff is taken as constant. Indeed, the resonance tends to disappear since it becomes

quite wide (width of hundreds of MeV) and located also hundreds of MeV above the πΣc thresh-
old. This behavior signiﬁcantly deviates from that expected for a genuine qqq state. Thus, the Nc
evolution supports the conjecture that the meson-baryon component in the wave-function of the

Λc(2595) plays a relevant role.

The above analysis is not consistent with the spin symmetry in the baryon sector, though it only

becomes exact in the large Nc limit [89], and thus one should be cautious about the consequences
extracted in such a scheme. This has motivated us to study the Nc−evolution of the Λc(2595)−pole
position from a different perspective, implementing exact SU(8) SF symmetry.

25

As discussed in Subsect. IV C 2, we cannot accurately study moderate values of Nc > 3 in this
context, because we do not know the orthogonal matrix USU(8)(Nc), which implements the change
of basis between the SU(8) one and that constructed out of the meson-baryon pairs. Yet, even if

we knew such rotation, the obtained results for moderate Nc values would not be physical because
SF symmetry does not guaranty HQSS in this intermediate regime. However, for sufﬁciently large

values of Nc, all meson masses become negligible as compared to those of the baryons, all of
which in turn, to a good approximation, have a common mass ˆM, proportional to Nc, as inferred
from Eq. (13),

ˆM = M0

Nc

+ O(1/Nc)

(29)

In the charm sector C = 1, there still appear only two types of conﬁgurations involving either only

a quark c or an additional c¯c pair, since there is always at most only one charm quark. Since the

heavy quark mass is not much larger than the typical scale associated to the cloud of light degrees

of freedom, and as Nc increases, the SU(8) SF symmetry should become more and more accurate.
Thus, the pole positions could be obtained in each JIS sector and C = 1 from (for simplicity, we

drop out the label JISC)

with GII(s), the matrix loop function calculated in the SRS. In the DR-naturalness renormalization

scheme, GII(s) becomes diagonal in the meson-baryon coupled–channel basis as it does the factor

Λc(2595) sector). We see how in the large Nc limit, we can determine the pole position inde-
pendently of the orthogonal transformation USU(8)(Nc). Thus, the pole positions are determined

with MR > M and ΓR > 0. The loop function GII(s) in the fourth quadrant, neglecting the meson

equation (32) has solutions only for negative eigenvalues, λ“120”, λ“168” and λ“4752”. As mentioned,
the “168” irreducible representation of SU(8) leads to the most attractive s−wave meson–baryon
interaction, and it becomes the only non-vanishing WT contribution in the strict Nc → ∞ limit.

λi ∼ O(1) ⇒ (MR − ˆM ) ∼pNc, ΓR ∼pNc
λi ∼ O(Nc) ⇒ (MR − ˆM ) ∼ O(1), ΓR ∼ O(1)

From the results of Table III of Ref. [16], we can see that the two Λc(2595) states predicted in
Ref. [77] and the J P = 3/2− Λc(2625) resonance stem from the 168 representation, and thus
one deduces that their widths and excitation energies behave as O(1) for Nc ≫ 3, as predicted by
Witten almost 30 years ago for genuine qqq states. However, the width and excitation energy of the
fourth resonance in the table, located around13 2800 MeV and associated to the 120 representation,
grow as √Nc in this limit. That is, this resonance would disappear, since it becomes wider and
heavier as Nc increases. This behavior would be similar to what we have seen earlier in Figs. 1
and 2. Note that the large 4752 is attractive and contains many exotic states that would disappear

in the large Nc limit as deduced from the above discussion.

The fact that the Λc(2595) resonance survives in the large Nc limit, contradicting the ﬁndings
of Figs. 1 and 2, is however quite natural. Indeed, it is natural to admit the existence of a (perhaps)

sub-dominant qqq component in the resonance wave function. Indeed, this resonance has been

studied with some success using a constituent quark model in Ref. [91]. Thus, one might expect

the Nc behavior close to the physical value Nc = 3 of the resonance is non qqq due to the unitarity

13 This resonance, with large couplings to Λcη and ΞcK, is also found in Ref. [12].

27

logs, but this sub-dominant qqq component would become dominant when the number of colors

gets sufﬁciently large [50, 51].

It is interesting to note that recently lattice QCD simulations have started to probe the depen-

dence on Nc of the properties of mesonic [92] and baryonic [93, 94] states. (See, Ref. [63] for a
comprehensive review.) Testing the Nc dependence of the Λc(2595) and other proposed molec-
ular states can help to unravel their true nature. In this sense, the present study should serve a

motivation for such studies.

V. SUMMARY

Understanding the Fock components of a hadronic state is a nontrivial task due to the non-

perturbative nature of the strong interactions at the relevant scales. Recent experimental obser-

vation of the so-called XY Z and baryonic pentaquark states have challenged the conventional

wisdom that baryons are composed of three quarks and mesons of a quark-antiquark pair. More

surprisingly, large hadron-hadron components are predicted for certain well established hadrons,

e.g., the N(1535). In the present work, we have used two widely accepted approaches to qualify
the Λc(2595) as a dynamically generated state, namely, the compositeness condition and the large
Nc evolution. Our results show that, although the relative importance of a particular coupled chan-
nel cannot be determined in a model independent manner, the basic picture that the Λc(2595) has
relevant meson-baryon components emerges as a robust conclusion. We have also shown that the

commonly deﬁned compositeness of the state depends on the included coupled channels, and also

on the scheme adopted to renormalize the ultraviolet divergent meson-baryon loop function, which

appears in the unitarized approaches. The importance of the molecular picture is also corroborated

by our study of the dependence on the number of colors of the mass and width of the Λc(2595). It
is shown that for moderate Nc > 3 values, they differ largely from those expected for a genuine
qqq state. We can not however discard the existence of a (perhaps) sub-dominant qqq component

in the resonance wave function, which would become dominant when the number of colors gets

sufﬁciently large.
