reading of my thesis partially and motivating me by the following Hemingway’s

advice on writing at the time when I was struggling to write my thesis by thinking

if a 10 page paper takes several months to write then how it will be possible to

manage a thesis consisting of 200 pages:

“Advice on how to write? Sit on a typewriter and start typing. That’s the

easiest and the hardest part.”

ABSTRACT

v

Neutrinos are neutral, spin- 1

2 particles which undergo only weak interactions.
The experimentally observed phenomenon of neutrino oscillation establishes the

fact that neutrinos are massive and there is mixing between diﬀerent neutrino

ﬂavours. This constitutes the ﬁrst unambiguous hint towards the physics Beyond

Standard Model (BSM). In the BSM theories, the neutrino mass terms in the

Lagrangian lead to the non-diagonal neutrino mass matrix in the ﬂavour basis

which depends on neutrino mass and mixing parameters. Thus knowledge of the

neutrino oscillation parameters and understanding the underlying symmetries of

the neutrino mass matrix are very important as they can give an insight to the

new physics beyond Standard Model. Therefore the measurement of diﬀerent

oscillation parameters and studying the structure of the neutrino mass matrix

are some of the main goals in neutrino physics at present.

Currently the paradigm of neutrino oscillation between three ﬂavours is well

established from diﬀerent experiments and the oscillation parameters are get-

ting measured with continued precision. The current unknowns in the neutrino

oscillation physics in the standard three generation framework are: the neu-

trino mass hierarchy, octant of θ23 and the leptonic phase δCP . There are many

ongoing/future experiments where these unknown oscillation parameters can be

probed. These experiments utilize diﬀerent sources and detectors as well as diﬀer-

ent baselines along which oscillations can develop. As the oscillation probabilities

depend diﬀerently on the parameters in diﬀerent oscillation experiments, com-

bination of diﬀerent experiments can often be useful. Apart from three ﬂavours

oscillations there are also evidences of oscillation involving sterile neutrinos. In

the presence of a sterile neutrino there will be new mixing angles and phases

contributing to the oscillation of the neutrinos. This gives rise to the possibil-

ity that the well understood phenomenological behaviour of the neutrino mass

matrix may change in the presence of sterile neutrinos.

In this thesis we have studied the potential of present/future neutrino os-

cillation experiments and synergy between them to determine the unknown pa-

vi

rameters in the neutrino sector in the light of current experimental results. We

consider the beam based experiments T2K, NOνA, LBNO, LBNE, the atmo-

spheric experiment INO@ICAL and the ultra high energy neutrino experiment

IceCube for our analysis. We ﬁnd that the data from atmospheric neutrino ex-

periment ICAL can signiﬁcantly improve the CP sensitivity of the long-baseline

experiments T2K/NOνA in their unfavourable parameter space. To improve

the sensitivity beyond what can be achieved in T2K/NOνA, it is important to

study the physics potential of the proposed long-baseline experiments LBNO

and LBNE in view of the current experiments. We have shown that the required

exposure of LBNO and LBNE in determining neutrino mass hierarchy, octant of

θ23 and δCP can be reduced signiﬁcantly when data from T2K, NOνA and ICAL

are added to them. We have also explored the possibility to constrain the CP

phase δCP by analyzing the IceCube data in terms of the ﬂavour compositions

of the ultra high energy neutrinos.

We have also studied the phenomenological consequences of texture zeros in

the neutrino mass matrices in the presence of a sterile neutrino. We have carried

out a detailed analysis of the two-zero and one-zero textures in the 3+1 scenario

which involves three active neutrinos and one sterile neutrino. We ﬁnd that

in the 3+1 picture, conclusions diﬀer signiﬁcantly as compared to the standard
3 generation case. The allowed two-zero textures in the 3 × 3 structure are
more phenomenologically constrained as compared to the 4 × 4 structure. The
correlations between the diﬀerent oscillation parameters are also very diﬀerent

when the texture zero conditions between the 3 generation and 3+1 generations

are compared.

Introduction

1.1 The Origin of Neutrinos

The physics of neutrinos started with Pauli’s “Neutrino Hypothesis”, but the

origin of neutrinos can be traced back to the late 19th century (1896) when

Becquerel discovered radioactivity. In radioactivity, nucleus of an unstable atom

loses energy by emitting alpha (α) particles, beta (β) particles and gamma (γ)

rays. As in the mechanism of α-particle emission, it was believed that β-decay

is also governed by the two-body process

N0(A, Z) → N(A, Z + 1) + e−,

and energy of the electron is given by the small diﬀerences in masses of the

nuclei. However, measurements of the electron energy spectra did not match this

expectation. By late 1920 it was conﬁrmed that this emission gives a continuous

spectra for the electron. This posed a puzzle since a two-body decay would imply

a ﬁxed energy line for the electrons. To overcome this Niels Bohr suggested that

the energy in the microworld was conserved only on an average, not on an event-

by-event basis. In 1930 Pauli postulated the “Neutrino Hypothesis” to save the

principle of conservation of energy in β-decay. He suggested that the continuum

spectra might be due to one more invisible light neutral particle involved in

the β-decay. With three particles involved, the electron would be able to take

any momentum from zero to the maximum allowed value, the balance being

1

2

Chapter 1. Introduction

taken care of by the other light invisible particle. In 1933 Fermi formulated his

theory of β-decay based on Pauli’s hypothesis. At that time the existence of

Pauli’s invisible particle was accepted and the name neutrino was coined. It was

postulated that all β-decays were due to the same basic underlying process,

n → p + e− + ¯ν.

To satisfy the conservation of angular momentum, neutrinos must be spin-1/2

particles obeying the Fermi-Dirac Statistics. But this theory was ﬁrmly estab-

lished only in 1953 when Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines detected this weakly

interacting particle experimentally [1, 2]. In their experiment, electron type an-

tineutrinos (¯νe) coming out of nuclear reactors were detected. Now it is well

established that there are three types of neutrinos. In 1962, Leon M. Lederman,

Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger showed the existence of the muon neutrino

(νµ) [3] and the ﬁrst detection of tau neutrino (ντ ) interactions was announced

in the summer of 2000 by the DONUT collaboration at Fermilab [4].

1.2 Neutrinos in Standard Model

The discoveries of diﬀerent fundamental particles (including neutrinos) in the

middle of the 20th century necessitated the formulation of a basic theory to

understand the properties of these particles and how they interact. In the eﬀort

to unify the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces, a theory known as the

Standard Model (SM) [5] of particle physics was developed throughout the latter

half of the 20th century1. The current formulation was ﬁnalised in the mid-1970s

upon experimental conﬁrmation of the existence of quarks. Mathematically, SM
is a non-abelian gauge theory based on the symmetry group U(1)Y × SU(2)L ×
In this model the left handed fermion ﬁelds are SU(2) doublets and
SU(3)c.

right-handed fermions are SU(2) singlets:

and uR, dR, eR.

1.2. Neutrinos in Standard Model

3

Here Q and L denote the quark and lepton ﬁelds respectively belonging to the

ﬁrst generation. In totality SM has three generations of quarks (ﬁrst generation

: u, d; second generation: c, s; third generation: t, b) and three generations of

leptons (ﬁrst generation : e, νe; second generation: µ, νµ; third generation: τ ,

ντ ). Each of the six quarks have three SU(3) colour charges: red, green and

blue. The W ± and Z bosons are the mediators of the weak force, photon is

the carrier of the electromagnetic force and the strong force is mediated by the

gluons. In this model neutrinos interact with the other leptonic ﬁelds weakly via

the exchange of W ± and Z bosons. The interactions mediated by the W ± boson

are called charge current (CC) interactions and the interactions mediated by the

Z boson are called neutral current (NC) interactions. In SM one can count the

number of light neutrino species that have the usual electroweak interactions in

the following manner: SM allows Z boson to decay to the invisible ν ¯ν pairs.

This invisible decay width is the diﬀerence between the total decay width of Z

and the visible decay width of Z. Visible decay width of Z boson is referred as

the sum of its partial widths of decay into quarks and charged leptons. From

the LEP (Large Electron-Positron collider) data, the ratio of the invisible de-

cay width of Z and the decay width of Z to the charged leptons (Γinv/Γll) is
measured as 5.943 ± 0.016. The SM value for the ratio of the partial widths
to neutrinos and to charged leptons (Γνν/Γll) is 1.99125 ± 0.00083. From this
(Γinv/Γll = Nν
) the number of the light active neutrino species Nν can be
calculated to be 2.9840 ± 0.0082 [7]. This is consistent with the fact that ex-
periments have also discovered only three light active neutrinos. Though SM is

Γνν
Γll

a mathematically self-consistent model and has demonstrated huge and contin-

ued success in providing predictions which could be conﬁrmed experimentally,

but there are certain drawbacks. One of them is the mass of the neutrinos. In

SM, the masses of the fermions and gauge bosons are zero before the symmetry

breaking of the group. After the spontaneous symmetry breaking, the gauge

bosons acquire mass via Higgs mechanism. This same Higgs mechanism is also

responsible for the masses of the fermions. The mass term of the fermions arise
from the Yukawa term which is written as: −y ¯ψLψRhφi, where y is the Yukawa

4

Chapter 1. Introduction

coupling, ψL, ψR are the left-handed and right-handed fermionic ﬁelds respec-
tively and hφi is the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the Higgs ﬁeld.
SM there are no right-handed neutrinos. With no suitable right-handed part-

In

ner, it is impossible to write a gauge invariant mass term for them in SM and

thus neutrinos remain massless. The absence of right-handed neutrinos in SM is

motivated by observation of parity violation in weak interactions. As a solution
of the τ − θ puzzle, in 1956 Lee and Yang conjectured that parity is violated in
weak interactions [8]. The violation of parity in weak interactions has been ﬁrst

observed in Wu’s experiment. When the nuclear spins of 60Co were aligned by an

external magnetic ﬁeld , an asymmetry in the direction of the emitted electrons

were observed [9]. The decay process under consideration was

60Co → 60Ni + e− + ¯νe.

It was found that nuclear spin of the electron was always opposite to its momen-

tum. In other words the observed correlation between the nuclear spin and the

electron momentum is only explained by the presence of eL and ¯νR. The absence

of “mirror image states” ¯νL and νR indicated a clear violation of parity. In 1958,

Goldhaber, Grodzins and Sunyar experimentally measured that neutrinos are

left-handed and antineutrinos are right-handed [10].

Although the neutrinos are massless in the SM, the experimentally observed

phenomenon of “neutrino oscillation” dictates that neutrinos have non-zero mass.

1.3 Neutrino Oscillation

Neutrino oscillation originally conceived by Bruno Pontecorvo in the 1950’s is a

quantum mechanical interference phenomenon in which a neutrino created with

a speciﬁc lepton ﬂavour (νe, νµ or ντ ) can later be measured to have a diﬀerent

ﬂavour [11]. This occurs if neutrinos have masses and mixing.

In that case

the ﬂavour eigenstates and the mass eigenstates are not the same. Neutrinos are

produced according to the gauge Lagrangian in their ﬂavour or gauge eigenstates

(να). The mass eigenstates or the propagation eigenstates (νi) are related to these

1.3. Neutrino Oscillation

as

|ναi = Uαi|νii,

5

(1.1)

with α = e, µ, τ and i = 1, 2, 3. Here U is the unitary mixing matrix known as

the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix. The probability that
a neutrino of ﬂavour να gets transformed into a ﬂavour νβ (να → νβ) after a
time interval t is given by the amplitude squared |hνβ(t)|ναi|2. For oscillation of
the three ﬂavours of neutrinos in vacuum, the probability of ﬂavour transition
να → νβ can be expressed as 2

where ∆ij = m2

j and i, j runs from 1 to 3. In this expression we clearly

see that the oscillatory terms depend on the mass squared diﬀerences of the neu-

trinos. Neutrino oscillation is also characterised by the energy of the neutrinos

E and the baseline L associated with it and the dependence goes as L/E. The

oscillation probability is maximum when L/E is of the order of ∆ij. The above

expression corresponds to oscillation in vacuum. For neutrinos traveling in mat-

ter, the interaction potential due to matter modiﬁes the neutrino masses and

mixing. We will discuss this in detail in the next chapter.

Now let us discuss brieﬂy about the parametrisation of the unitary PMNS
matrix U. We know that any general N×N unitary matrix consists of N 2 number
of independent parameters having N(N −1)/2 number of angles and N(N + 1)/2
number of phases. But among N(N + 1)/2 phases not all are physical. It can
be shown that a total (2N − 1) number of phases can be absorbed in the 2N
number of ﬁelds in the Lagrangian (For N generation of fermions, there will be

N generation of charged leptons and N generation of neutrinos) and this gives
total number of physical phases as 3 (N − 1)(N − 2)/2. So for three generations
of neutrinos, the mixing matrix is parametrised by three mixing angles : θ12, θ23

2We will give the derivation of this expression in Chapter 2.

can not be probed in neutrino oscillation.

and θ13, one phase: the Dirac type phase δCP in the following way,

only probe the mass squared diﬀerences of the neutrinos but not their absolute

masses. There are tritium beta decay experiments which measure the absolute

mass of neutrinos. The combined data of Troitsk [12] and Mainz [13] experiments

give the upper bound of electron neutrino mass as < 1.8 eV. The KATRIN ex-

periment [14] which will be operational in 2016 is expected to improve on this

bound. There are also weak bounds on muon neutrino mass and tau neutrino

mass coming from pion and tau decay as < 0.17 MeV [15] and < 18.2 MeV [16]

respectively. The neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ) experiments [17] which

can probe Majorana nature of the neutrinos can also put constraint on the eﬀec-

tive Majorana neutrino mass 4. An upper bound on the sum of active neutrino

masses as 0.23 eV [18] comes from cosmology. From the neutrino oscillation

experiments we know that the two mass squared diﬀerences which govern the

oscillation of the three generations of neutrinos are of the order of 10−5 eV2 and

10−3 eV2 [19]. Thus the oscillation data together with the cosmological bound

signify that the neutrino masses are much smaller than the masses of the charged

leptons.

1.4 Evidences of Neutrino Oscillation

Neutrinos can originate from diﬀerent sources having energy ranging from few

eV to PeV. From Fig. 1.1, we can see that among all the sources, the relic neutri-

nos, which were decoupled from the other particles at the very early stage of the

universe, have the smallest energy but maximum ﬂux. They are the most abun-

dant particles in the universe after the photons. Most of the solar neutrinos are

generated from the p-p fusion inside the sun whereas reactor and geo-neutrinos

originate from the beta decay process and all of these neutrinos have energy in

the MeV range. The neutrinos coming from the supernova explosions are gener-

ated through the electron capture of nuclei and free protons as well as through

pair production. They also have energy in the MeV range. The interactions of

the cosmic rays with the atmospheric nuclei produce neutrinos in the GeV range

and the neutrinos coming from the extragalactic sources fall in the energy range

of TeV. The neutrinos produced in the man-made accelerators can have energy

in MeV or GeV. The highest energy cosmogenic neutrinos are produced due to

interaction of the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays with cosmological photon back-

grounds. They could also be produced in the interactions of accelerated protons

with surrounding medium.

Among these diﬀerent sources, evidences of neutrino oscillation have come

from solar, atmospheric, accelerator and reactor neutrino experiments. Below we

discuss about the production mechanism of neutrinos in these type of experiments

and describe how diﬀerent experiments contributed to establish the phenomenon

of neutrino oscillation on a ﬁrm footing. In this context we will also discuss the

production mechanism of the ultra high energy neutrinos. Though the main aim

of the ultra high energy neutrino experiments is to study the interaction and

production mechanism of the neutrinos from various astrophysical sources, data

from these experiments can also be used to constrain the oscillation parameters.

1.4.1 Solar Neutrinos

Solar neutrinos are produced by thermo-nuclear fusion reactions occurring at the

core of the Sun. The underlying process is,

4p → α + 2e+ + 2νe.

This occurs through proton-proton (pp) chain and CNO cycle producing a large

number of neutrinos in MeV energy range. Detecting these neutrinos at Earth

was important to study the theory of stellar structure and evolution, which is

the basis of the standard solar model (SSM). This was the aim of the pioneer-

ing experiment by Davis and collaborators using radiochemical Chlorine (37Cl)

detector [21]. This was sensitive to only electron neutrinos. However, it was

found that the observed neutrino ﬂux is only about one third of the solar-model

predictions [22, 23]. This deﬁcit constitutes “the solar-neutrino problem”. It was

diﬃcult to explain this deﬁcit within the SSM and there were attempts to explain

the discrepancy by proposing that the models of the Sun were wrong [24–26].

1.4. Evidences of Neutrino Oscillation

9

Many model independent solutions were proposed [27–31]. The phenomenon

of neutrino oscillations was also considered as one of the possible solutions. In

1981-82, the real time neutrino-electron scattering experiment, Kamiokande [32],

became operational which conﬁrmed the deﬁcit observed in the chlorine experi-

ment and also proved that the detected neutrinos actually came from the Sun.

Later in 1990 Gallium based experiments, with a lower energy threshold (and

thus sensitive to the pp neutrinos) like GALLEX [33] and SAGE [34] (later GNO

[35]) corroborated the fact that the measured neutrino signal was indeed smaller

than the SSM prediction. The importance of the Ga experiments lies in the

detection of the primary pp neutrinos thereby conﬁrming the basic hypothesis of

stellar energy generation. Super-Kamiokande (SK), an upgraded version of the

Kamiokande experiment [36] further conﬁrmed the solar neutrino deﬁcit with

enhanced statistics. But the real breakthrough in solar neutrino physics was

due to the advent of the SNO [37, 38] experiment. Because of its sensitivity to

both charge current (CC) and neutral current (NC) interactions, it measured

simultaneously the contributions from only electron neutrinos and from all three

active ﬂavours respectively. By measuring the CC/NC ratio as less than one,

SNO established the presence of νµ and ντ ﬂavours in the solar neutrino ﬂux.

The NC measurement also conﬁrmed that the measured total neutrino ﬂux was

in very good agreement with the SSM predictions. These results clearly showed

that neutrinos change their ﬂavour during their way from the production point

in the Sun to the detector and the phenomenon of neutrino oscillation emerged

as the clear solution to the solar neutrino problem.

1.4.2 Atmospheric Neutrinos

Apart from the solar neutrinos, neutrino oscillation has also been observed in the

atmospheric neutrino experiments. Atmospheric neutrinos were ﬁrst detected in

the mines of Kolar Gold Fields of India [39] and at the same time in a gold

mine of South Africa [40]. Atmospheric neutrinos result from the interaction

of cosmic rays with atomic nuclei in the Earth’s atmosphere, creating pions and

kaons, which are unstable and produce neutrinos when they decay in the following

10

manner:

Chapter 1. Introduction

π±(K ±) → µ± + νµ(¯νµ),

µ± → e± + νe(¯νe) + ¯νµ(νµ).

From this decay chain, the expected number of muon neutrinos are about twice
that of electron neutrinos. However water ˇCerenkov detectors like Kamiokande

[41], IMB [42, 43] and iron calorimeter detector Sudan2 [44] reported results

contrary to this expectation. To reduce the uncertainties in the absolute ﬂux

values, these experiments presented results in terms of the double ratio R

R =

(Nµ/Ne)obs
(Nµ/Ne)MC

,

(1.6)

where MC denotes Monte-Carlo simulated ratio. The above experiments found

the value of R to be signiﬁcantly less than one. This became known as the “At-

mospheric Neutrino Anomaly”. However two other iron calorimeter detectors

Fr´ejus [45, 46] and Nusex [47] found results consistent with the theoretical ex-
pectations. The reduction in R can be explained by either νµ → νe or νµ → ντ
oscillations or both. Apart from altering the ﬂavour content of the atmospheric

neutrino ﬂux, oscillations can induce the following eﬀect. If the oscillation length

is much larger than the height of the atmosphere but smaller than the diameter

of the Earth then neutrinos coming from the opposite side of the Earth (upward

going neutrinos) will have signiﬁcant oscillations. This will create a non uniform

zenith angle dependence in the observed data. The high statistics SK experiment

indeed found this zenith angle dependence in their multi-GeV data establishing

neutrino oscillation on a ﬁrm footing.

1.4.3 Accelerator Neutrinos

Neutrino oscillations have also been observed from the neutrinos produced in

particle accelerators. Neutrino beams produced at a particle accelerator oﬀer the

greatest control over the neutrinos being studied. In accelerators, neutrino beam

can be produced in two methods: through the decay of pions at rest (DAR) and

1.4. Evidences of Neutrino Oscillation

11

the decay of pions in ﬂight (DIF). In both the methods, high intensity protons

are collided with a ﬁxed target to produce charged pions. In DAR mechanism,

the resulting π− are being absorbed and π+ are brought to rest and then they

decay in the following manner

π+ → µ+ + νµ,
µ+ → e+ + νe + ¯νµ,

to produce ¯νµ having maximum allowed energy of 52.8 MeV. The main aim of
these type of experiments is to observe clean oscillations in the ¯νµ → ¯νe channel
as there is no intrinsic ¯νe background from the source. In the DIF mechanism, the

pions decay while traveling in the decay pipe to produce neutrinos and muons.

The muons are absorbed and thus one gets pure neutrino or antineutrino beams

depending on the polarity of the charged pions. The neutrinos produced in this

fashion are essentially beams of νµ and ¯νµ with energy ranging from few tens

of MeV to GeV. There were several experiments having baselines of the order

of few tens of meters5 looking for neutrino oscillations using neutrinos produced

in the accelerators. All of them gave null result except the LSND experiment
[49]. LSND reported an excess of events in both νµ → νe and ¯νµ → ¯νe oscilla-
tions. It has observed the neutrino events in DIF mode and antineutrino events

in DAR mode. The MiniBooNE [50] experiment at Fermilab was proposed to

test the LSND results using a diﬀerent L and E but the same L/E ratio as

LSND. It is found that the antineutrino data of MiniBooNE is consistent with

the LSND observations6. There are also accelerator experiments like K2K [51]

and MINOS [52] which have studied the oscillations of the neutrinos in the GeV

energy range. These are the long-baseline experiments having baselines around

several hundreds of kilometers. K2K has observed neutrino oscillations via muon
neutrino disappearance channel (νµ → νµ) and MINOS has observed events in

5For a comprehensive list see for instance Ref. [48].
6Note that the oscillation results of LSND and MiniBooNE can not be explained in the

three generation neutrino framework and require the existence of sterile neutrinos.

12

Chapter 1. Introduction

both appearance (νµ → νe) and disappearance measurements. For these exper-
iments, the neutrino beam power of the accelerators were around few hundreds

of KW. The ongoing long-baseline experiment T2K [53] has observed oscillated

muon and electron neutrino events at the far detector located 295 km away from

the neutrino source. Recently the NOνA experiment at Fermilab also given its

ﬁrst results which also show a clear evidence of neutrino oscillation [54]. To have

enough sensitivity of the sub-dominant electron neutrino appearance channel,

T2K/NOνA as well as the other future generation long-baseline experiments are

designed to have beam power of the order of MW. Because of this very high beam

power, this type of experiments are often termed as “superbeam” experiments.

The high beam power of these experiments also allow to obtain enough statisti-

cally signiﬁcant number of signal events over the expected backgrounds. These

accelerator based long-baseline experiments have conﬁrmed the oscillations of

the atmospheric neutrinos as the associated L/E in these cases are such that the

oscillations are governed by the atmospheric mass square diﬀerence ∆31.

1.4.4 Reactor Neutrinos

Another major source of the man-made neutrinos from where oscillations have

been observed are the nuclear reactors. In reactors, antineutrinos of the energy

around few MeV are produced by the nuclear ﬁssion processes. Because of this
low energy such experiments are sensitive to only ¯νe → ¯νe oscillations i.e., they
look for a diminution in the ¯νe ﬂux. Many experiments have searched for oscil-

lation of the reactor neutrinos by detecting the oscillated electron antineutrino

events via inverse beta decay (IBD). The measurement of oscillation parameters

in the nuclear reactors mainly suﬀers due to the uncertainties in the strength

of the sources, the detector eﬃciency and the cross sections for neutrino inter-

actions. Thus one needs a good knowledge of the ﬂux. The uncertainties can

be minimized by the inclusion of a near detector. The earlier experiments like

ILL-Grenoble [55], Rovno [56], Savannah River [57], Gosgen [58], Krasnoyarsk

[59], BUGEY [60] searched for oscillations of the reactors antineutrinos at dis-

tances < 100 m from the reactor core. But all these experiments got null results

1.4. Evidences of Neutrino Oscillation

13

7. The next generation longer baseline reactor experiments CHOOZ [62, 63]

and Palo Verde [64, 65] looked for oscillations at a distance of 1 km but they

also did not report any evidence of neutrino oscillations. The KamLAND [66]

experiment, started in 2002, was the ﬁrst to observe oscillations of the antineu-

trinos coming out of nuclear reactors. As the baseline of KamLAND was 180

km, it was sensitive to oscillations governed by the mass squared diﬀerence 10−5

eV2 which is relevant for the ﬂavour conversion of the solar neutrinos. Thus

KamLAND conﬁrmed the oscillations of the solar neutrinos using a man-made

neutrino source. Recently the observations of oscillation in the reactor experi-

ments DOUBLE-CHOOZ [67], RENO [68] and Daya Bay [69] have established

the non zero value of θ13 with signiﬁcant conﬁdence level. These experiments

have baselines of few kilometers and thus sensitive to oscillations governed by

atmospheric mass squared diﬀerence of the order of 10−3 eV2.

1.4.5 Ultra High Energy Neutrinos

Ultra high energy (UHE) neutrino telescopes were planned to study the neutri-

nos from distant astrophysical sources [70]. Currently envisaged astrophysical

sources of high energy cosmic neutrinos include for instance, active galactic nu-

clei (AGN) [71] and gamma ray burst (GRB) ﬁre balls [72]. The production of

high energy cosmic neutrinos from sources other than the AGNs and GRBs are

also possible [73]. In those sources protons are accelerated to very high energies

by the Fermi acceleration mechanism [74]. The interactions of these protons with

soft photons or matter from the source can give UHE neutrinos. These neutrinos

travel a long distance from their source to reach the Earth. The oscillation of

this very high energy neutrinos are averaged out due to the long distance and

their ﬁnal ﬂavour composition depends on the initial sources of the neutrinos

7 Recent study of reactor antineutrino spectra show a 3% enhancement in the ﬂuxes as

compared to the previous calculation. With this new re-evaluated ﬂuxes, the ratio of observed

event rate to predicted rate for the < 100 m reactor experiments shifts from 0.976 to 0.943,

giving rise to reactor neutrino anomaly [61]. This deﬁcit could not be explained in three ﬂavour

framework and the presence of sterile neutrinos were evoked as a possible explanation.

14

Chapter 1. Introduction

as diﬀerent sources can have diﬀerent initial ﬂavour composition. Recently the

IceCube [75] collaboration has reported the results of an all-sky search for UHE

neutrino events which was conducted during May 2010 to May 2013. They have

detected a total of 37 neutrino events of extraterrestrial origin at 5.7σ conﬁdence

level. These events fall in the energy range between 30 to 2000 TeV. For these
observed 37 events, the expected cosmic ray muon background was 8.4± 4.2 and
the backgrounds from atmospheric neutrinos were 6.6+5.9
−1.6 events. These results

are consistent with the framework of neutrino oscillations over the astronomical

distances. The recent IceCube observation of a 2.3 PeV event correspond to the

highest-energy neutrino interaction ever observed [76].

1.5 Neutrino Mass Matrix

The observation of non-zero neutrino mass via neutrino oscillations necessitates

an extension of the Standard Model. A successful model for neutrino mass needs

to explain how neutrinos get their mass as well as why the mass is so tiny. It also

requires to explain the observed mixing pattern among the neutrinos. One can

simply extend the SM by adding right-handed neutrinos and generate the Dirac

neutrino masses in a similar fashion as that of the charged leptons and quarks.

But to obtain neutrino mass in the sub eV range, one requires a very small

value of the Yukawa coupling i.e., of the order of 10−12. Introduction of such

small coupling constants is generally considered unnatural and one must ﬁnd a

symmetry reason for such smallness. The most elegant way to generate small

neutrino mass naturally is the See-Saw mechanism which relates the smallness

of neutrino masses to new physics at high scale. In See-Saw mechanism neutrino

mass originates from the dimension ﬁve operator [77, 78]

k

MR

LLφφ, where L

is the lepton doublet, φ is the Higgs doublet, k is the dimensionful coupling

constant and MR is the scale of the beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics.

This operator can be realized at the tree level by three ultraviolet completions

which are known as Type I [79–82], Type II [83–86] and Type III [87] See-Saw.

In Type I See-Saw, SM is extended by heavy right-handed singlet neutrinos. In

1.5. Neutrino Mass Matrix

15

Type II and Type III See-Saw, scalar triplets and fermion triplets are added to

the SM respectively. The most economical case among these three is the Type I

See-Saw where after the spontaneous symmetry breaking, the neutral component

of the Higgs doublet acquires a vacuum expectation value (VEV) v and the light

neutrino mass is obtained as

mν ∼ v2/MR.

(1.7)

To have neutrino mass around 0.1 eV, one needs MR around 1014 GeV which

is close to the scale of the Grand Uniﬁed Theories (GUT). See-Saw mechanism

predicts the Majorana nature of the neutrinos which implies that the neutrinos

are their own antiparticles. This mechanism also predicts violation of lepton

number by two units. In Type I See-Saw the light neutrino mass matrix which
is a 3 × 3 complex matrix in 3 generation, is given by

Mν = MDM −1

R M T
D,

(1.8)

where MD is the Dirac mass arising from the Yukawa term yν ¯LLνRφ and MR
is the Majorana mass coming from the Majorana mass term ¯νC

R νR. In general

the neutrino mass matrix Mν in ﬂavour basis is not diagonal and the complex
symmetric 3 × 3 low energy mass matrix is given by

Mν = V ∗M diag

ν V †,




where, M diag

ν

= diag(m1, m2, m3) and V = U.P denotes the leptonic mixing

matrix in a basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal. U is the

PMNS matrix described earlier and P is the diagonal phase matrix of Majorana

phases written as

P = diag(1, eiα, ei(β+δ)).

(1.11)

As the elements of this matrix are functions of oscillation parameters (includ-

ing the Majorana phases), the structure of the low energy mass matrix can be

constrained using present experimental data.

Chapter 1. Introduction

1.6 Unknown Oscillation Parameters and Fu-

ture Prospects: Three Generations

In the last two decades there has been a tremendous progress in the determi-

nation of the parameters that describe neutrino oscillation of the three active

neutrinos. The solar neutrino experiments and KamLAND have measured the

parameters θ12 and ∆21 with considerable precision. The measurements of θ23
and |∆31| come from atmospheric neutrino experiments, MINOS and T2K. The
reactor experiments have measured the value of θ13 with appreciable precision.

We will discuss the present constraints on oscillation parameters from the global

analysis of the world neutrino data in the next chapter. At present the unknown

oscillation parameters are: (i) the sign of ∆31 or the neutrino mass hierarchy,

(ii) the octant of θ23 (i.e., whether θ23 < 45◦ or > 45◦) and (iii) CP violation

in leptonic sector and the precision of δCP . Apart from these, the following un-

resolved issues are also of interest: (i) the absolute mass of the neutrinos, (ii)

the exact nature of the neutrinos i.e., Dirac or Majorana, (iii) the mechanism of

generation of neutrino masses and explanation of their smallness, (iv) non stan-

dard interaction (NSI) of the neutrinos, (v) non-unitary neutrino mixing and (vi)

CPT violation in neutrino oscillation etc.

The measurement of various oscillation parameters are important not only to

understand the exact nature of neutrino oscillation but also for building models

in BSM scenario. Many BSM models can be accepted or rejected depending

upon their prediction of diﬀerent oscillation parameters. So a precise measure-

ment of the oscillation parameters can guide towards a successful BSM theory.

Determination of δCP can also give clue in understanding the present matter-

antimatter asymmetry of the universe. The matter-antimatter asymmetry of the

universe can be explained by the process of baryogenesis. But the baryogenesis

in SM is not suﬃcient to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the uni-

verse. One option to create additional baryon asymmetry is via leptogenesis in

which the decay of heavy right handed neutrinos (for instance those belonging

1.6. Unknown Oscillation Parameters and Future Prospects: Three Generations17

to the See-Saw models) can create lepton asymmetry which can be converted to

baryon asymmetry. Diﬀerent studies show that under certain conditions, it may

be possible to connect the leptonic CP phase δCP to leptogenesis [88].

There are various current ongoing/future upcoming neutrino oscillation ex-

periments dedicated for determining the remaining unknown oscillation param-

eters. Below we mention some of the major projects. The beam based long-

baseline experiments T2K and NOνA [89], which are both taking data at present,

adopted the oﬀ-axis technique which gives a narrow ﬂux at the oscillation max-

ima to reduce backgrounds at the high energy tail. The experiment T2K itself

does not have hierarchy sensitivity and NOνA has hierarchy sensitivity in a lim-

ited range of δCP space. But their main aim is to measure the leptonic phase

δCP . The experiments LBNE8 [91] and LBNO [92] will make use of the on-axis

broad band ﬂux to probe oscillation over a wide energy range. Due to the com-

paratively longer baseline and higher statistics, LBNO and LBNE experiments

can measure all the three above mentioned unknowns with signiﬁcant conﬁdence

level. The DAEδLUS experiment [93] proposes to replace the antineutrinos of

the superbeam experiments by the low energy antineutrinos from muon decay at
rest and using Gd-doped water ˇCerenkov detector. This approach will give larger

antineutrino event sample as compared to the conventional superbeam technique.

The superbeam experiment at the ESS facility [94] proposed to study the physics

at the second oscillation maximum for obtaining signiﬁcant sensitivity towards

establishing CP violation.

The atmospheric neutrino experiments ICAL@INO [95] will consist of a mag-

netized iron calorimeter detector for studying neutrino and antineutrino events

separately. These type of detectors are sensitive to muons and they have good

energy and direction measurement capability. The Hyper-Kamiokande [96] and
PINGU [97] experiments will have large volume water ˇCerenkov detectors. These

detectors can measure energy and direction of both electrons and muons but do

not have the charge identiﬁcation capability. The aim of these experiments are

8Recently there are discussions on converging the LBNO and LBNE projects into a combined

initiative called DUNE [90].

18

Chapter 1. Introduction

mainly to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy.

In reactor experiments one can have hierarchy sensitivity by using the oscil-

lation interference eﬀect between ∆31 and ∆32. The primary goal of the medium

baseline reactor neutrino experiments JUNO [98] and RENO-50 [99] is to deter-

mine the mass hierarchy using liquid scintillator detector. These experiments

require the precise measurement of the oscillation spectrum with an excellent

energy resolution.

Apart from these above mentioned neutrino oscillation experiments, there

are also experiments whose primary aim is not to determine the oscillation pa-

rameters but still it is possible to probe diﬀerent oscillation parameters in these

experiments. The 0νββ and ultra high energy neutrino experiments are example

of such experiments. The main aim of the ongoing ultra high energy neutrino

detector IceCube at south pole is to understand the origins and acceleration

mechanisms of high-energy cosmic rays. But it is also possible to probe diﬀerent

oscillation parameters at IceCube. So a comprehensive phenomenological study

regarding the potential of the various neutrino oscillation experiments towards

completing the gaps in oscillation physics is extremely relevant at this point.

1.7 Sterile Neutrinos: Beyond Three Genera-

tions

Another intriguing aspect of current oscillation picture is the existence of light

sterile neutrino. Neutrino oscillation in the standard three ﬂavour picture is now

well established from diﬀerent oscillation experiments. However, the reported

observations of ¯νµ - ¯νe oscillations in the LSND experiment [49, 100, 101] and

recent conﬁrmation of this by the MiniBooNE experiment [102, 103] with oscil-

lation frequency governed by a mass-squared diﬀerence around 1 eV2 cannot be

accounted for in the above framework. These results motivate the introduction

of at least one extra neutrino of mass of the order of eV to account for the three

independent mass scales governing solar, atmospheric and LSND oscillations. As

we already know that the LEP data on measurement of Z-line shape dictates

1.8. Thesis Overview

19

that there can be only three light neutrinos with standard weak interactions, the

fourth light neutrino, if it exists must be a Standard Model singlet or sterile.

Recently this hypothesis garnered additional support from (i) disappearance of

electron antineutrinos in reactor experiments with recalculated ﬂuxes [61] and (ii)

deﬁcit of electron neutrinos measured in the solar neutrino detectors GALLEX

and SAGE using radioactive sources [104]. The recent ICARUS results [105]

however, did not ﬁnd any evidence for the LSND oscillations. But this does not

completely rule out the LSND parameter space and small active-sterile mixing

still remains allowed. There are also constraint about existence of an extra rela-

tivistic species from the CMB anisotropy measurements [106–111] which prefer

the the eﬀective neutrino number to be greater than three. Recently the com-

bined data of Planck, WMAP polarization and the high multipole results gives

Neﬀ = 3.36+0.68

−0.64 at 95% C.L [18]. Clearly this data do not completely rule out the

existence of a fourth neutrino species. Thus, the situation with sterile neutrinos

remains quite interesting and many future experiments are proposed/planned

to test these results and reach a deﬁnitive conclusion [112].

In view of these,

the study of diﬀerent phenomenological implications of sterile neutrinos assume

an important role. Note that the results in the 3 generation scenario can diﬀer

signiﬁcantly in the presence of sterile neutrino.

1.8 Thesis Overview

In this thesis ﬁrst we have studied the potential of long-baseline experiments

T2K, NOνA and atmospheric neutrino experiment ICAL@INO to discover CP

violation in the leptonic sector. We have also studied the role of the three above

mentioned experiments to economise the conﬁguration of future proposed long-

baseline experiments LBNO and LBNE in determining the remaining unknowns

in neutrino oscillation. We have used the recent IceCube data to put constrain

over δCP as well as various astrophysical sources. Finally we have studied the

structure of the low energy neutrino mass matrix in ﬂavour basis in terms of

texture zeros in the presence of one extra light sterile neutrino. The plan of the

20

Chapter 1. Introduction

thesis goes as follows.

In Chapter 2, we give an overview of neutrino oscillation in vacuum and mat-

ter elaborating on how matter eﬀect modiﬁes the mass and mixing parameters.

We will give derivations of the relevant expressions of the oscillation probabili-

ties. Then we will describe the present status of the oscillation parameters. We

will also review the parameter degeneracy in neutrino oscillation and describe

how the physics capability of diﬀerent long-baseline experiments are constrained

due to the parameter degeneracy. We will end this chapter by giving a short de-

scription about the current/future oscillation experiments which we have studied

in this thesis.

In Chapter 3 we will discuss how the various neutrino oscillation parameters

can be probed in future oscillation experiments. This chapter will contain the

main results of our neutrino oscillation analysis and will be organised as follows:

First we will discuss the CP sensitivity of the T2K and NOνA by taking their

projected exposures. Next we discuss how atmospheric neutrino experiment

ICAL can improve the CP sensitivity of T2K and NOνA. We further extend

this study taking diﬀerent exposures and gauge the capability of these setups to

discover CP violation and also in measuring the precision of δCP .

Next we study how the diﬀerent setups of the LBNO project can be economised

by using current/upcoming facilities T2K, NOνA and ICAL. For our analysis we

consider three prospective LBNO setups CERN-Pyh¨asalmi (2290 km), CERN-

Slanic (1500 km) and CERN-Fr´ejus (130 km) and emphasize on the advantage

of exploiting the synergies oﬀered by T2K, NOνA and ICAL in evaluating the

adequate exposure which is the minimum exposure required in each case for de-

termining the remaining unknowns of neutrino oscillation i.e hierarchy, octant

and δCP at a given conﬁdence level.

Then we will carry out a similar analysis as described above, for the LBNE

project at Fermilab. Apart from ﬁnding the adequate exposure of LBNE in

conjunction with T2K, NOνA and ICAL, we will also quantify the eﬀect of the

proposed near detector on systematic errors, examine the role played by the

second oscillation cycle in furthering the physics reach of LBNE and present an

1.8. Thesis Overview

21

optimisation study of the neutrino-antineutrino running.

Finally we will study how the recent data of IceCube can constrain the lep-

tonic CP violating phase δCP . We also use this data to impose constraints on

the sources of the neutrinos.

In Chapter 4, we will discuss the structure and properties of neutrino mass

matrices and its phenomenological consequences in terms of texture zeros with

sterile neutrinos and compare our results with the three generation case. First

we will consider the two-zero textures of the low energy neutrino mass matrix

in presence of one additional sterile neutrino. We discuss the mass spectrum

and the parameter correlations that we ﬁnd in the various textures. We also

present the eﬀective mass governing neutrinoless double beta decay as a function

of the lowest mass. Next we will study the phenomenological implications of the

one-zero textures of the same neutrino mass matrices in the presence of a sterile

neutrino. We study the possible correlations between the sterile mixing angles

and the Majorana phases to give a zero element in the mass matrix.

We will summarize and present the impact of our work in the last chapter.

Chapter 2

Neutrino Oscillation

2.1 Overview

In this chapter we discuss the salient features of neutrino oscillation phenomena.

As mentioned in the introduction, neutrino oscillation is described by the transi-

tion probability from one ﬂavour to another. This is a function of neutrino mass

squared diﬀerences, mixing angles and the Dirac type CP phase. To understand

the dependence of the oscillation probability on diﬀerent oscillation parameters,

one needs to derive the analytic expressions for the same. In the ﬁrst section

of this chapter we will give the derivations of the expressions for the oscilla-

tion probability in diﬀerent scenarios. For the determination of the remaining

unknowns in the oscillation sector, one needs to use the information from the

past/present experiments as inputs. Thus in the next section, we discuss the

current status of the oscillation parameters by comparing global analysis of the

world neutrino data as obtained by diﬀerent groups. Next we discuss what are

the diﬃculties in measuring the unknowns and what are the future facilities that

are aimed towards determination of these. This leads us to the discussion about

the parameter degeneracies in view of the current oscillation data. We present

the hierarchy-δCP degeneracy and the octant-δCP degeneracy in detail. In the

next section we will give the salient features of the present/future oscillation

experiments whose physics potential we have studied in this thesis.

24

Chapter 2. Neutrino Oscillation

2.2 Derivation of Oscillation Probability

In this section we will give the derivations of the expressions for neutrino os-

cillation probabilities in vacuum and matter and show the dependence of the

oscillation probabilities on diﬀerent oscillation parameters. For neutrinos propa-

gating in vacuum, it is possible to derive exact analytic expressions. For matter

one needs to solve the propagation equation using the relevant density proﬁle.

For matter of constant density, exact expressions can be derived for the two

ﬂavour case. For three ﬂavours, the probability expressions even in constant

matter density can be derived only under certain approximations. We will start

this section by deriving the vacuum oscillation probability for two ﬂavours which

is important to understand the basic mechanism of neutrino oscillation. We also

give expressions for generalised N ﬂavour oscillation from which we can easily

calculate the three ﬂavour expression. For the matter case, ﬁrst we will de-

rive the exact two ﬂavour expression in constant density matter and show how

the matter eﬀect can modify the vacuum mass and mixing. We will end this

section by describing how under the “one mass scale dominance” (OMSD) and
the α − s13 (double expansion in α(= ∆21/∆31) and sin θ13) approximations one
can derive the expressions for probability of the three generation neutrinos in

matter of constant density. We will also discuss the validity condition of these

approximations.

2.2.1 Two Flavour Oscillation in Vacuum

First let us consider only the ﬁrst two generations of neutrinos νe and νµ. In this
case the mixing matrix U will be 2×2 unitary matrix parametrised by one mixing
angle θ. The relation between the ﬂavour eigenstates and the mass eigenstates

can be written as

2.2. Derivation of Oscillation Probability

The time evolution of the state νe after time t is given by

|νe(t)i = e−iE1t cos θ|ν1i + e−iE2t sin θ|ν2i,

25

(2.2)

where E1 and E2 are the energies of the mass eigenstates ν1 and ν2 having mass

m1 and m2. The energy Ei can be written as (in the units of c = 1)

Ei ≈ p +

(2.3)

(2.4)

Note that in this plane wave treatment of neutrino oscillation, we have assumed

that all the massive neutrinos are of equal momentum 1 p. The survival proba-

bility of the electron neutrino νe is given by

Pee = |hνe|νe(t)i|2

= (cos2 θe−iE1t + sin2 θe−iE2t)(cos2 θeiE1t + sin2 θeiE2t)
= 1 − sin2 2θ sin2{(E2 − E1)t/2}.

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

Using Eq. 2.4 in Eq. 2.7 and remembering the fact that in the relativistic limit
p ≈ E and t ≈ L (for c = 1 and  = 1) we obtain

Pee = 1 − sin2 2θ sin2{∆21L/4E}

= 1 − sin2 2θ sin2{1.27∆21L/E},

(2.8)

(2.9)

where in Eq. 2.9, ∆21 = m2
1 is in eV2, L is in km and E is in GeV.
The conversion probability i.e., the transition probability from νe → νµ can be
obtained from Eq. 2.9 as

2 − m2

Peµ = 1 − Pee

= sin2 2θ sin2{1.27∆21L/E}.

(2.10)

(2.11)

From Eq. 2.11 it is clear that the oscillatory behaviour of the neutrinos is em-

bedded in the term containing ∆21 and this term will go to zero when either

1A more realistic approach is to consider the wave packet treatment as real localised particles

are described by superpositions of plane waves [113]. However for the oscillation scenarios which

are considered in this thesis, wave packet eﬀects have no practical consequences when neutrinos

are relativistic [114].

26

Chapter 2. Neutrino Oscillation

the masses m1 and m2 are equal or when both of them are zero. Thus neutrino

oscillation requires non-degenerate and non-zero masses of neutrinos. Another

important feature of Eq. 2.11 is that, this expression is not sensitive to the octant

of θ (i.e., θ < 45◦ or > 45◦) and the sign of ∆21 as the transformation deﬁned by
θ → π/2 − θ and ∆21 → −∆21, leaves this equation unaltered.

Here it is important to note that neutrino oscillation is also characterised by

the value of L and E under consideration. For a combination of L and E such

that the oscillatory term ∆21L/4E goes to zero, there will be no oscillation. On

the other hand if we consider a very high value of L, then there will be very large

number of oscillation cycles at smaller values of E. Hence the oscillation will be

averaged out and probabilities will not depend explicitly on the masses of the

neutrinos any more. This is the case for ultra high energy neutrinos which travel

a large distance in vacuum to reach the Earth. The maximum oscillation of the

neutrinos can be obtained under the condition

1.27∆21L/E = nπ/2,

(2.12)

where n = 1 correspond to ﬁrst oscillation maxima. This is the case for ac-

celerator based long-baseline neutrino experiments. Here the accelerators are

designed such that the neutrino ﬂux peaks at the energies where the oscillation

is maximum. For example in the T2K experiment, the distance from source to

detector is 295 km and the neutrino ﬂux peaks at 0.6 GeV. Putting this number

in the above equation, for n = 1 we get the value of the mass squared diﬀerence
as 2.5 × 10−3 eV2 which is close to the current best-ﬁt of the atmospheric mass
squared diﬀerence.

Before generalising the above formula for N ﬂavours, we would like to give

another alternative method to derive the same oscillation formula. This formal-

ism will be important at the time of deriving the oscillation formula in matter.

The time dependent Schr¨odinger equation in the mass basis can be written as

= HM νi,

A1 = sin2 θ, A2 = cos2 θ, B1 = sin θ cos θ, B2 = − sin θ cos θ.

2.2.2 N Flavour Oscillation in Vacuum

In this section we derive the vacuum oscillation probability for a generalised N
ﬂavour oscillation scenario. For N ﬂavours, the mixing matrix U is a N × N
unitary matrix parametrised by N(N − 1)/2 number of mixing angles and (N −
1)(N − 2)/2 number of phases. At time t = 0, the ﬂavour eigenstates are written
as 2

2.2.3 Two Flavour Oscillation in Matter

Neutrino propagation in matter modiﬁes the neutrino oscillation probabilities.

When active neutrino ﬂavours traverse through matter, their evolution equation

is aﬀected by the potentials due to the interactions with the medium through

coherent forward elastic weak charge current (CC) and neutral current (NC)

scatterings. The charge current interactions aﬀect only νe since normal matter

consists of electron, proton and neutron but the neutral current interactions

aﬀect all the three active neutrinos. These interactions can be represented by

the Feynman diagrams given in Fig. 2.1.

Figure 2.1: CC and NC interactions of neutrinos.

As the NC scattering potential modiﬁes the propagation equation for all the

neutrinos in the same way, it does not have any eﬀect on the ﬁnal expressions of

neutrino oscillation probabilities. The CC interaction aﬀects only the electron

neutrinos and it modiﬁes the probability expression signiﬁcantly. The eﬀective

Hamiltonian for the CC interaction can be written as

Heﬀ =

GF√2(cid:2)¯eγµ(1 − γ5)νe(cid:3)(cid:2)¯νeγµ(1 − γ5)e(cid:3),

(2.40)

where GF is the Fermi constant. Using the Fierz transformation we obtain

Heﬀ =

GF√2(cid:2)¯eγµ(1 − γ5)e(cid:3)(cid:2)¯νeγµ(1 − γ5)νe(cid:3).

(2.41)

The interaction potential is given by the average of the eﬀective Hamiltonian

2.2. Derivation of Oscillation Probability

over the electron background i.e.,

¯Heﬀ =

GF√2h¯eγµ(1 − γ5)ei(cid:2)¯νeγµ(1 − γ5)νe(cid:3).

31

(2.42)

In the non-relativistic limit using the explicit forms of Dirac spinors one can show

that [117, 118]

h¯eγµγ5ei ∼ spin,

h¯eγiei ∼ velocity,
h¯eγ0ei = Ne,

(2.43)

(2.44)

(2.45)

where Ne is the electron number density of the medium. In the rest frame of

unpolarised electrons only Ne term is non-zero and thus we obtain

¯Heﬀ = √2GF Ne ¯νeLγ0νeL

= vCC ¯νeLγ0νeL

= vCCjν,

(2.46)

(2.47)

(2.48)

where νeL = 1−γ5

2 νe, jν = ¯νeLγ0νeL and vCC is the interaction potential given by

vCC = √2GF Ne.

(2.49)

ν = ¯νC

The energy eigenvalues of H matt

are obtained by diagonalising the above:

(2.59)

(2.60)

(2.61)

(2.62)

(2.63)

Now remembering the fact that E2−E1 = (m2

mass squared diﬀerence in the presence of matter as

1)/2E, we obtain the modiﬁed

∆M

21 = p(−A + ∆21 cos 2θ)2 + (∆21 sin 2θ)2.

(2.64)

The above equation shows how the masses are modiﬁed in the presence of the

matter term A. Now we will see how the mixing is being modiﬁed. Let us assume

that the modiﬁed mixing angle in the presence of matter is θM and we call the

2.2. Derivation of Oscillation Probability

33

modiﬁed mixing matrix as UM . The matrix H matt

F

which is now in ﬂavour basis

can be converted into mass basis by the transformation H matt

M = U †

M H matt

F UM .

Setting the oﬀ-diagonal terms as zero we obtain

tan 2θM =

∆21 sin 2θ

−A + ∆21 cos 2θ

,

and the expression for the probability for Peµ becomes 3

Peµ = sin2 2θM sin2(1.27∆M

21L/E).

(2.65)

(2.66)

Note that, the expression for the vacuum oscillation probability was not sen-

sitive to the sign of ∆21 and octant of θ but due the modiﬁcation in mass and

mixing, the expression is sensitive to both of them. Another interesting phe-

nomenon in this case is the MSW (Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein) resonance.

This happens when

∆21 cos 2θ = A

= 0.76 × 10−4(cid:20)

ρ

gm/cc(cid:21)(cid:20) E

GeV(cid:21)eV2.

(2.67)

(2.68)

If this condition is satisﬁed then we see that the mixing angle becomes maxi-

mal4 i.e., π/4. This leads to the possibility of total transitions between the two

ﬂavours. Since for neutrinos A is positive, resonance can only occur for ∆21 > 0

and θ < π/4 or ∆21 < 0 and θ > π/4. For antineutrinos the resonance con-

dition is given by ∆21 > 0 and θ > π/4 or ∆21 < 0 and θ < π/4. From this

it is clear that the enhancement of the neutrino and antineutrino probabilities

depend on the sign of ∆21 and octant of θ. Thus the experimental observation

of this resonance eﬀect can lead to the determination of the same.

2.2.4 Three Flavour Oscillation in Matter: The OMSD

Approximation

In this section we discuss how the probability expressions can be derived, for three

generations in matter of constant density. As we have mentioned earlier, in this

3In this derivation, we have used the constant matter density approximation.
4For matter density of 4.15 gm/cc, which is relevant for baseline of 7000 km, resonance

occurs at 7.5 GeV for a mass squared diﬀerence of 10−3 eV2 and sin2 2θ = 0.1.

34

Chapter 2. Neutrino Oscillation

case it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd exact analytic expressions for the probabilities. In this

section we will use the one mass scale dominance (OMSD) approximation [119]

in deriving the same. For the three generation scenario the eﬀective Hamiltonian

in the ﬂavour basis takes the following form

The OMSD approximation implies that the measured small mass squared diﬀer-

ence ∆21 can be neglected as compared to ∆31. Under this approximation, the

eﬀects of the solar mixing angle θ12 and of the CP violating phase in U become

inconsequential and U simply becomes

E2 = 0.

4E h∆31 + A ±p(∆31 cos 2θ13 − A)2 + (∆31 sin 2θ13)2i , (2.71)

(2.72)

In this approximation the modiﬁed mixing matrix UM can be written as

UM = R23RM
13.

(2.73)

Thus matter eﬀect do not modify the mixing angle θ23. This can be qualitatively

understood from the fact that matter eﬀect only modiﬁes the evolution equation

for νe and mixing of νe with the mass eigenstates states does not involve the

mixing angle θ23. Again in a similar manner as described in the two ﬂavour case,

the relation between the modiﬁed mixing angle θM

13 and the vacuum angle θ13

can be derived as

tan 2θM

13 =

∆31 sin 2θ13

∆31 cos 2θ13 − A

(2.74)

2.2. Derivation of Oscillation Probability

Eq. 2.39 by replacing U by UM . Below we write the probability formula derived
under the OMSD approximation for the transition νe → νµ:

(2.77)

We will give the expression for the Pee channel in the appendix.

Let us now brieﬂy discuss the validity condition of the OMSD approximation.

The condition on the neutrino energy and baseline for the OMSD approximation

to be valid is

∆21L
E ≪ 1.

(2.78)

This corresponds to L/E ≪ 104 km/GeV which is mainly the case for the atmo-
spheric neutrinos. OMSD approximation also needs large values of θ13 because

the terms appearing with ∆21 can only be dropped if they are small compared

to the leading order term containing θ13. We will discuss this point again after
discussing the α− s13 approximation which we will use in the next subsection to
derive the most general three ﬂavour oscillation expression in matter.

2.2.5 Three Flavour Oscillation in Matter: The α − s13

Approximation

In this subsection we will give the derivation of the approximate three ﬂavour

probability expressions using the series expansion method [120] in a constant

matter density. We will study expansions in terms of the mass hierarchy pa-

rameter α = ∆21/∆31 and mixing parameter s13 = sin θ13 keeping terms up to

explicit assumptions about the values of L/E are made. However, we remark

that the series expansion formula is no longer valid as soon as α∆ = ∆21L/4E

by replacing δCP of Peµ by −δCP .

becomes order of unity, i.e., when the oscillatory behaviour is governed by the

mass squared diﬀerence ∆21. As this is not the case for the current generation

long-baseline experiments, we will use this formula to understand the oscillation

physics for the same. But this condition can occur for very long baselines and/or

very low energies where these equations will no longer be applicable.

After discussing the validity of the α − s13 approximation, let us go back to
the validity of the OMSD approximation. We have already discussed the fact

that the OMSD approximation will fail if θ13 is too small. If we compare the

ﬁrst and second terms of Eq. 2.101, it is obvious that the ﬁrst term can be safely

neglected in comparison to second if

sin θ13 ≫ α.

(2.103)

Now using current best-ﬁt values of ∆21 and ∆31, the above condition translates

to

sin θ13 ≫ 0.03,

(2.104)

which is consistent with the current value of this parameter.

Note that, as the OMSD approximation is exact in θ13, the physics near

the resonance region can be explained better using this approximation as com-
pared to the α − s13 approximation. For this reason one can use the OMSD
approximation to understand the oscillation results of the atmospheric neutrino

experiments. For the baselines involved in these experiments the MSW resonance
eﬀect is relevant. On the other hand the α − s13 approximation is appropriate
for explaining the physics of the current generation long-baseline experiments

for probing the sub-leading eﬀect of δCP . One can check this by solving the full

three ﬂavour neutrino propagation equation numerically assuming the Prelim-

inary Reference Earth Model (PREM) density proﬁle for the Earth [122] and

comparing this with the various analytic expressions.

As for example, in Fig. 2.2 we have plotted Pµe as a function of energy

for the baselines 7000 km and 810 km. From the ﬁgure we can notice that for

L = 7000 km and E = 7.23 GeV which is the MSW region relevant for the case

of the atmospheric neutrinos, the OMSD approximation matches perfectly with

the numerical calculation 7. On the other hand for the baseline of 810 km, where
the ﬁrst oscillation maximum lies very far from the resonance energy, the α− s13
approximation gives better estimation than the OMSD approximation.

2.3 Current Status of the Oscillation Parame-

ters

In this section we discuss the current status of neutrino oscillation parameters.

The mass and mixing parameters that describe the oscillation of the three gener-

ation neutrinos, are divided into three categories (except the leptonic phase δCP ):

the solar neutrino parameters i.e., θ12, ∆21, the atmospheric neutrino parameters

i.e., θ23, ∆31 and reactor neutrino parameter i.e., θ13. The parameters are termed

like this because the oscillation in the respective sectors are governed mainly by

these parameters. Speciﬁcally the parameters θ12 and ∆21 are mainly constrained

from the solar neutrino experiments and KamLAND reactor data. The acceler-

ator based long-baseline experiments (MINOS, T2K) constrain the parameters
|∆31|, θ23, and δCP . The parameters |∆31| and θ23 are also constrained from

value of θ13 aﬀects both solar and atmospheric oscillation results, it plays an

important role in the global ﬁt of world neutrino data.

At present, one of the major unknowns in the three ﬂavour oscillation picture

is the sign of the atmospheric mass squared diﬀerence ∆31 or the neutrino mass

hierarchy. The +ve sign of ∆31 corresponds to m3 > m1 which is known as
normal hierarchy (NH) and −ve sign of ∆31 implies m3 < m1 which is known as
inverted hierarchy8(IH) (shown in Fig. 2.3). The second unknown in this sector

is the octant of θ23. If θ23 is less than 45◦, then the octant of θ23 is lower (LO)

and if θ23 is greater than 45◦ then the octant of θ23 is higher (HO). The last

remaining unknown in the three ﬂavour framework is the value of the leptonic

phase δCP .

Next we discuss the current status of these parameters in detail. Currently

there are three groups doing the global analysis of the world neutrino data. We

have given the results of the latest global analysis by the Nu-ﬁt group [124] in

Table 2.1 and compared the results of diﬀerent groups in Fig. 2.4 in terms of

analysis by the Bari group [19], IFIC group [125] and Nu-ﬁt group respectively.

The solid (dashed) line corresponds to NH (IH). From Fig. 2.4 we can see that

except θ23, the global analysis results for the other parameters, are consistent

among the three groups. For the mixing angles, best-ﬁt values of θ12 and θ13

are around 34◦ and just below 9◦ respectively. For mass squared diﬀerences, the
best-ﬁt values of ∆21 and |∆31| come around 7.5 × 10−5 eV2 and 2.4 × 10−3 eV2
respectively. The analysis also shows that, at this moment both the hierarchies

give equally good ﬁt to the data. Regarding the phase δCP , we can see that the

current data signal a best-ﬁt value around 250◦. This hint is mainly driven by

the T2K appearance channel measurement and data from the reactors measuring

θ13. But this signal is not statistically signiﬁcant as at 3σ, the full δCP range

becomes allowed.

Now let us discuss the case of θ23 in detail. In their analysis, the Bari group

has ﬁtted θ23 separately for NH and IH. When the data from long-baseline, solar

and KamLAND are combined, they get the best-ﬁt of θ23 in the higher octant

for both NH and IH. But after addition of the reactor data, whose main eﬀect is

to reduce the θ13 uncertainty, the best-ﬁt for NH shifts to the lower octant. The

conclusions after adding the Super-Kamiokande atmospheric data are diﬀerent

before and after the Neutrino 2014 conference. Before Neutrino 2014, due to

the addition of the Super-Kamiokande data, the best-ﬁt for IH shifted to the

lower octant but after Neutrino 2014 addition of Super-Kamiokande data only

increases the signiﬁcance of the ﬁt for the lower octant in NH and for IH the

best-ﬁt remains in the higher octant [126]. Thus according to results from the

global analysis by the Bari group, θ23 seems to prefer the LO for NH and and HO

for IH. This result is diﬀerent with their previous analysis result [127], where for

both the hierarchy best-ﬁt was obtained in the lower octant. But the conclusions

are somewhat diﬀerent according to the analysis of IFIC group, which also do

separate ﬁts for NH and IH. From the analysis of the solar, KamLAND and

accelerator data, they found the best-ﬁt to come in the lower octant for both NH

and IH. By the addition of reactor data, the best-ﬁt values for both the hierarchies

44

Chapter 2. Neutrino Oscillation

move to the higher octant. In this case the addition of Super-Kamiokande data

do not have any eﬀect. Thus the analysis of IFIC group shows that θ23 prefers

HO for both the hierarchies. Now let us come to the results of Nu-ﬁt group.

The Nu-ﬁt group does not analyse NH and IH separately. In their analysis they

get the global best-ﬁt of θ23 in the higher octant and for IH. For NH, a local

minima is obtained. So in conclusion we can say that, from the present available

information of the world neutrino data, there is yet no clear hint about the octant

of θ23 and more data from present/future experiments are expected to address

this issue.

Now let us discuss a bit more about of the present unknowns in terms of

oscillation probabilities.

• As discussed earlier, matter eﬀect plays a key role in the determination of
neutrino mass hierarchy. Note that for the solar neutrinos, the MSW reso-

nance eﬀect in the core of the Sun implies that the solar mixing angle θ12 is

in the ﬁrst octant and this gives m2 > m1 [128]. For the determination of

the sign of ∆31, one needs to study the Earth matter eﬀect of neutrino os-

cillation. In Table 2.2, we list the resonance energies for diﬀerent baselines

in the Earth as given in [129]. From these we understand that the energies

of the current generation long-baseline experiments are very far from the

resonance energies to observe the MSW resonance eﬀect. But still these ex-

periments can have hierarchy sensitivity coming from the electron neutrino

appearance channel depending on the length of the baseline. At present

T2K and NOνA are the examples of such long-baseline experiments which

have given data corresponding to appearance channel. But the compara-

tively smaller baseline of T2K does not allow it to measure neutrino mass

hierarchy and the ﬁrst results from NOνA [54] are also not yet statistically

signiﬁcant for getting a clear hint. On the other hand the atmospheric

neutrino experiments study the oscillation of the neutrinos having energy

ranging from 1-10 GeV with the maximum available baseline equals to the

diameter of the Earth. So it is possible to determine neutrino mass hierar-

chy in the atmospheric neutrino experiments via MSW resonance eﬀect in

both appearance and disappearance channel 9. But for the current Super-

Kamiokande experiment, at this moment there is not enough statistics for

obtaining any clear hint about the true mass hierarchy.

• Now let us discuss why the octant of θ23 is still unknown. Similar to that
of hierarchy, the octant sensitivity of the long-baseline experiments come

from only appearance channel (cf. Eqs. 2.101 and 2.102) and in the at-

mospheric experiments octant sensitivity arise from both appearance and

disappearance channel (cf. Eqs. 2.75 and 2.76). From the probability ex-

pressions in matter, we see that the leading order term of the appearance

channel depends on sin2 θ23 and thus the appearance channel probability

is an increasing function of θ23. But in the disappearance channel proba-
bility, the leading order term sin2 2θ23 gives equal probability10 for θ23 and
π/2 − θ23. But note that, though the disappearance channel do not give
any octant sensitivity for the long-baseline experiments but this channel is

useful for the precision measurement of θ23. Thus in principle it is possible

9In atmospheric neutrinos the hierarchy sensitivity can also come from the disappearance

channel. This is a sharp contrast in comparison with the long-baseline experiments because in

this case, the larger matter eﬀects also give hierarchy sensitivity for the disappearance channel.
10It is important to note that in the appearance channel, the octant sensitive term sin2 θ23

appears with θ13. Thus the precise measurement of θ13 also improves the octant sensitivity

[130].

46

Chapter 2. Neutrino Oscillation

to determine the octant of θ23 from the combination of appearance and

disappearance channels in the long-baseline experiments if θ23 is not very

close to maximal. On the other hand, for atmospheric neutrinos, due to

matter eﬀect, the disappearance channel also contribute in the octant mea-

surement. But at present the available statistics is not enough to predict

the correct octant of θ23.

• In the previous section we have seen that under OMSD approximation
the conversion probability for νe do not involve δCP and in the α − s13
approximation, δCP appears in the sub leading term α. So we understand

that δCP is a sub-leading eﬀect in neutrino oscillation and thus it is the most

diﬃcult parameter to probe in the experiments. Though the atmospheric

neutrino experiments can have CP sensitivity in principle but they are not

expected to measure δCP as we will show in the next chapter that their CP

sensitivity is compromised due to their dependence on the direction of the

incoming neutrinos. On the other hand as reactor experiments are sensitive

only to electron appearance channel which do not depend on δCP , they are

also not capable of measuring this parameter. So it is expected that the

ﬁrst hint of δCP will come from the appearance channel measurement of

the long-baseline experiments. As we have already discussed, the current
T2K data gives a hint of δCP about (−90◦), but this needs to be conﬁrmed
from the further runs of T2K as well as data from future experiments.

Apart from the reasons mentioned above, the measurement of these above

unknowns are also restricted due to the presence of parameter degeneracy, which

we will discuss now.

2.4 Degeneracies in Oscillation Parameters

In this section we will discuss the degeneracies between the diﬀerent oscillation

parameters. The parameter degeneracy in the context of neutrino oscillations

implies getting the same value of probability for diﬀerent sets of oscillation pa-

rameters. The sensitivity of an experiment depends on the number of events

2.4. Degeneracies in Oscillation Parameters

47

which are the functions of neutrino oscillation probabilities. This implies that in

the presence of degeneracies, diﬀerent sets of parameters can give equally good ﬁt

to the data making it diﬃcult to determine the actual values of the parameters

unambiguously. So a clear understanding of various degeneracies, their depen-

dence on diﬀerent oscillation parameters and their resolution are very important

for the determination of the unknown parameters. Previously when θ13 was un-

known, three types of degeneracies have been discussed widely in the literature:

(i) the intrinsic (θ13, δCP ) degeneracy [131], (ii) hierarchy-δCP degeneracy [132],

and (iii) the degeneracy of octant of θ23 [133]. The intrinsic degeneracy of the

Pµe channel refers to the same value of probability coming from a diﬀerent θ13

and δCP value and can be expressed as

Pµe(θ13, δCP ) = Pµe(θ′

13, δ′

CP ).

(2.105)

The hierarchy-δCP degeneracy of the Pµe channel leads to wrong hierarchy so-

lutions arising due to a diﬀerent value of δCP other than the true value. This

degeneracy can be expressed mathematically as

Pµe(NH, δCP ) = Pµe(IH, δ′

CP ).

(2.106)

The intrinsic octant degeneracy of the Pµµ channel refers to the clone solutions
occurring for θ23 and π/2 − θ23 and expressed as

Pµµ(θ23) = Pµµ(π/2 − θ23).

(2.107)

These above mentioned degeneracies together (Eqs. 2.105, 2.106 and 2.107)

gave rise to a total eight fold degeneracy [134].

It is important to note that

there is no intrinsic octant degeneracy in the Pµe channel as the dependence of
θ23 in the leading order term of Pµe channel goes as sin2 θ13 sin2 θ23. But due
to the presence of the sin2 θ13 term, continuous allowed regions were obtained
in the θ13 − θ23 plane for a given value of δCP when θ13 was not known very
precisely. There were several proposals on how to break these degeneracies to

have a clean measurement of the neutrino oscillation parameters [135–146]. It is

shown that the intrinsic degeneracy can be removed to a large extent by using

48

Chapter 2. Neutrino Oscillation

spectral information [140]. At present, the measurement of the non-zero precise

value of θ13 from the reactor experiments resolves the degeneracies associated

with θ13. The intrinsic degeneracy is largely resolved and the octant sensitivity

of the appearance channel has greatly improved. But due to the completely

unknown value of δCP , the hierarchy-δCP degeneracy still persists and there are

also degenerate solutions arising due to diﬀerent values of θ23 and δCP . This

degeneracy is referred as octant-δCP degeneracy [147]. We will now discuss the

behaviour of these degeneracies in detail in the next subsections.

2.4.1 The Hierarchy-δCP Degeneracy

As discussed above the hierarchy-δCP degeneracy of the appearance channel is

deﬁned by

Pµe(NH, δCP ) = Pµe(IH, δ′

CP ),

(2.108)

i.e., for a given octant, the probability for NH can be the same as that of proba-

bility for IH, for a diﬀerent value of δCP . To understand this degeneracy, in Fig.

2.5 we have plotted the appearance channel probability vs energy for a baseline

of 812 km. At this baseline the constant matter density approximation holds

good and we can use Eq. 2.101 to understand the behaviour of Fig. 2.5. The

left panel in Fig. 2.5 is for neutrinos and the right panel corresponds to antineu-

trinos. In this plot θ23 is ﬁxed at 39◦. The blue band corresponds to NH and the
red band corresponds to IH. Here the values of ∆31 are taken as 2.4(−2.4)× 10−3
eV2 corresponding to NH (IH). The width of the bands is due to the variation
of δCP from −180◦ to +180◦. As matter eﬀect enhances the neutrino probabil-
ity for NH and antineutrino probability for IH, in these plots we see that for

the neutrinos, NH probability is higher than IH and for the antineutrinos, IH

probability is higher than NH. In the neutrino probability, we observe that for
each band (either NH or IH) δCP = −90◦ corresponds to the highest point in
the probability and δCP = 90◦ is the lowest point in the probability. This be-

haviour is opposite for the antineutrinos. This can be understood by having a

close look at the Eq. 2.101. At the oscillation maximum, ∆ = 90◦. Thus the

δCP dependent term for neutrinos becomes maximum for δCP = −90◦ and min-
imum for δCP = 90◦. For antineutrinos as δCP changes its sign this behaviour

gets reversed. In both the plots we observe that there is an overlap between the
NH band at δCP = +90◦ and IH band at δCP = −90◦. If the true values of the
parameters fall in the overlapping region then we will have degenerate solutions.

Based upon this observation if we divide the total range of δCP into two half-
planes i.e., the lower half-plane (LHP: −180◦ < δCP < 0◦) and upper half-plane
(UHP: 0◦ < δCP < 180◦), then we see that the combination of hierarchy and

δCP given by NH-LHP and IH-UHP lies far away from the overlapping regions.

Hence these combinations do not suﬀer from the hierarchy-δCP degeneracy and

thus LHP (UHP) is the favourable half-plane for NH (IH). On the other hand

the combination of NH-UHP and IH-LHP lies very close to the overlapping area

and hence can give rise to hierarchy-δCP degeneracy. Thus UHP (LHP) is the

unfavourable half-plane for NH (IH) in view of this degeneracy. Here it is im-

portant to note that the favourable and unfavourable half-planes remain same

in both neutrinos and antineutrinos.

One of the ways to overcome the hierarchy-δCP degeneracy is to look for

neutrino oscillations at higher baselines. At longer baselines, there will be more

matter enhancement of the oscillation probabilities and this will cause more

50

Chapter 2. Neutrino Oscillation

separation between the NH and IH bands. This is shown in Fig. 2.6, where we

can see that near the oscillation maxima, there is no overlap between the NH

and IH bands for the 1300 km baseline.

Another elegant method to get rid of this degeneracy is the following: If
one puts sin2 ˆA∆ = 0 in Eq. 2.101, then the probability expression becomes free

from the δCP term and thus there is no hierarchy-δCP degeneracy. This condition

translates to L = 7690 km for both NH and IH and this baseline is referred as

the magic baseline [148]. This is reﬂected in Fig. 2.7, where one can see that

for L = 7690 km, the hierarchy-δCP degeneracy is completely absent. One also

notices that, the width of the δCP band is very narrow.

In spite of having

this magical property, practically it is a very diﬃcult task to design a neutrino

oscillation experiment for a baseline of 7690 km. As the ﬂux of the neutrinos

fall as 1/L2, one needs a very powerful collimated neutrino beam to have enough

statistics at such a large distance 11. Another problem with the magic baseline

is that, it has no CP sensitivity. These problems lead to the question that can

there be a shorter baseline where the hierarchy-δCP degeneracy can be removed

and at the same time one can also have CP sensitivity. These questions were
answered in [151] by observing that if one puts sin2( ˆA−1) = 0 in Eq. 2.101, then

11There were several proposals to explore the physics at magic baseline using neutrino fac-

tories [149] and beta beams [150].

also the CP sensitive term goes to zero. Unlike the magic baseline, this condition

also depends on hierarchy. If we now demand that there is no δCP dependence

for IH and at the same time there is a probability maxima in NH, then one gets

the following conditions

(1 + ˆA) > nπ for n > 0,
(1 − ˆA) > (m − 1/2)π for m > 0.

(2.109)

Solving these two equations simultaneously one obtain L ≈ 2540 km and E ≈ 3.3
GeV for n = m = 1. Now on the other hand if one demands that there will be

no δCP dependence for NH and a probability maxima in IH, then one obtains

[152]

(1 − ˆA) > nπ for n > 0,
(1 + ˆA) > (m − 1/2)π for m > 0,

(2.110)

and solutions of these two equations again yield L ≈ 2540 km but E ≈ 1.9
GeV for n = 1, m = 2. These features are shown in Fig. 2.8, where one

can see that for L = 2540 km there is no CP sensitivity in IH and probability

maxima in NH at E = 3.3 GeV and at E = 1.9 GeV there is no CP sensitivity

in NH and probability maxima in IH. Thus for a baseline of L = 2540 km,

one can have hierarchy sensitivity for both NH and IH with CP dependence in

one hierarchy and with no CP dependence for the opposite hierarchy though

at diﬀerent energies. This baseline was termed as the bi-magic baseline [151–

153]. In the next chapter, while discussing the physics potential of the LBNO

experiment we will see that there is an exceptional hierarchy sensitivity at the

CERN-Pyh¨asalmi baseline of L = 2290 km due to its proximity to the bi-magic

baseline.

Note that in the atmospheric neutrinos experiments, oscillation takes place

over the baselines ranging from 100 km to 12000 km experiencing huge Earth

matter eﬀects. For this reason the eﬀect of hierarchy-δCP degeneracy is less

pronounced for the case of atmospheric neutrinos.

2.4.2 The Octant-δCP Degeneracy

The octant-δCP degeneracy can be expressed mathematically in the following

way

Pµe(LO, δCP ) = Pµe(HO, δ′

CP ),

(2.111)

i.e., for a given hierarchy, the appearance channel probability for lower octant

can be the same as the probability for the higher octant corresponding to a

diﬀerent value of δCP . To understand how this degeneracy behaves in neutrino

and antineutrino probabilities, in Fig. 2.9, we show the appearance channel

probability as a function of energy by ﬁxing the hierarchy to be NH. This ﬁgure

corresponds to a baseline of 812 km. The left panel is for neutrinos and the

right panel is for antineutrinos. The blue band corresponds to LO and red band

corresponds to HO. In these plots LO (HO) corresponds to θ23 = 39◦(51◦). Here
also the width of the bands are due to the variation of δCP from −180◦ to +180◦.
As the leading order term in the oscillation probability depends on sin2 θ23, we see

that for both neutrinos and antineutrinos, the probability for HO is higher than
LO. As discussed earlier, for neutrinos, in each band, δCP = −90◦ corresponds to
maximum point in the probability and δCP = 90◦ corresponds to the minimum

point in the probability while opposite is true for antineutrinos. Now from the

probability ﬁgure we observe that, for neutrinos the overlap is around LO-δCP =
−90◦ and HO-δCP = 90◦ and for antineutrinos the overlap is around LO-δCP =
90◦ and HO-δCP = −90◦. So in this case for neutrinos, UHP (LHP) is the
favourable half-planes for LO (HO), where it is less probable to have the octant-

δCP degeneracy and LHP (UHP) is the unfavourable half-planes for LO (HO)

where one has the octant-δCP degeneracy. But this situation gets reversed in

the antineutrinos i.e., the favourable regions for neutrinos become unfavourable

in antineutrinos and the unfavourable regions for neutrino become favourable in

antineutrinos. This is the main diﬀerence between the hierarchy-δCP and octant-

54

Chapter 2. Neutrino Oscillation

δCP degeneracy, where in the former case, the data from antineutrinos do not

help to resolve this degeneracy but for the later case, it is possible to resolve this

degeneracy with balanced neutrino and antineutrino runs.

Here we would like to mention that as the atmospheric neutrinos consists

of both neutrinos and antineutrinos, the octant-δCP degeneracy is less for the

case of atmospheric neutrino experiments. In this case the sub-leading terms of

the disappearance channel12 also provide octant sensitivity due to large matter

eﬀects. In this context it is important to note that in the atmospheric neutrinos

the uncertainty in θ13 do not aﬀect the measurement of θ23. This is because near

the resonance region the sin2 2θM

13 term in Eq. 2.76 becomes unity.

From the above discussions we understand how the presence of hierarchy-δCP

and octant-δCP degeneracy, can severely aﬀect the determination of the unknown

oscillation parameters. The hierarchy-δCP degeneracy gives rise to wrong hier-

archy solutions, whereas octant-δCP gives rise to wrong octant solutions. These

two types of degeneracies together give rise to a generalised hierarchy-θ23-δCP

degeneracy deﬁned as

Pµe(NH, θ23, δCP ) = Pµe(IH, θ′

23, δ′

CP ),

(2.112)

which can give wrong hierarchy-wrong octant solution. As hierarchy, octant and

δCP are interlinked, the determination of one quantity depends on the information

of the other quantities and the presence of degeneracies makes it diﬃcult to

extract the correct information as the true solution can often be faked by other

degenerate solutions. In [147, 154] it was shown that the hierarchy and octant

sensitivity of the long-baseline experiments suﬀers from these above mentioned

degeneracies due to the unknown value of δCP . In the next chapter when we will

study the physics potential of the various oscillation experiments, we will show

how the lack of knowledge of hierarchy and octant, aﬀect the CP measurement

capabilities of the long-baseline experiments.

appendix.

2.5 Salient Features of the Present/Future Gen-

eration Oscillation Experiments

In this section we discuss the main features of the currently running/upcoming

oscillation experiments T2K, NOνA, LBNO, LBNE and INO which are expected

to throw light on the three yet undetermined parameters of neutrino oscillation.

We will also brieﬂy describe the IceCube experiment at south pole. Though the

aim of the IceCube experiment is to study the physical processes associated with

the ultra high energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin, but one can also put con-

straint on the various oscillation parameters by analysing its data. These are the

experiments whose potentials have been studied in this thesis for determination

of neutrino mass hierarchy, octant of θ23 and the leptonic CP phase δCP .

2.5.1 T2K

T2K (Tokai to Kamioka) is a long-baseline experiment in Japan looking for

neutrino oscillations in both appearance and disappearance channels [155]. T2K
uses Super-Kamiokande (SK) as the far detector, which is a water ˇCerenkov

detector located in the Kamioka Observatory, Gifu, Japan, at a distance of 295

km from J-PARC high-intensity proton accelerator. The beam power is 0.75

MW with mean neutrino energy as 0.76 GeV. The neutrino beam is directed

2.5 degrees oﬀ-axis from the SK detector, in order to produce a narrow-band

ﬂux at 0.6 GeV. The experiment also includes two near detectors at a distance

280 m (INGRID and ND280). Construction of the neutrino beamline started in

April 2004. After successful installation of the accelerator and neutrino beamline

in 2009, T2K began accumulating neutrino beam data for physics analysis in

January 2010. But it was interrupted for one year due to the Great East Japan

Earthquake in 2011. Up to now T2K has collected data corresponding to the
exposure of 6.6× 1020 POT (Protons on Target) in neutrino mode and currently
taking data in antineutrino mode. The recent measurements of the oscillation

parameters in T2K can be found in [53]. We summarize the details of data taking

2.5.2 NOνA

The NuMI Oﬀ-axis νe Appearance (NOνA) experiment at Fermilab is a two-

detector, long-baseline, neutrino oscillation experiment optimised for νe identiﬁ-

cation. NOνA uses Fermilab’s NuMI beamline having a beam power of 700 KW,

as its neutrino source. The 14 kt far detector is situated at a distance of 812 km,

near Ash River, Minnesota and the 0.3 kt near detector is located at the Fer-

milab site, near the existing MINOS Near Detector Hall. The 14 mrad oﬀ-axis

conﬁguration of the NuMI beam gives relatively narrow band of neutrino ener-

gies centered at 2 GeV. Both the NOνA detectors are highly segmented, highly

active tracking calorimeters, ﬁlled with liquid scintillator. NOνA has started

taking data from December 2014 and has given the ﬁrst physics results recently

[54]. More details of NOνA has been discussed in [89].

2.5.3 LBNO

One of the promising proposals for long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment,

is the LAGUNA (Large Apparatus studying Grand Uniﬁcation and Neutrino

2.5. Salient Features of the Present/Future Generation Oscillation Experiments57

Astrophysics) -LBNO (Long Baseline Neutrino Oscillation) project13 in Europe

[92]. The source of neutrinos for this experiment is likely to be at CERN. Vari-

ous potential sites for the detector have been identiﬁed by LAGUNA, including

Boulby (U.K.), Canfranc (Spain), Fr´ejus (France), Pyh¨asalmi (Finland), Slanic

(Romania), SUNLAB (Poland) and Umbria (Italy) [157]. There are three diﬀer-

ent proposed detectors for the LBNO project: GLACIER (liquid argon), LENA
(liquid scintillator) and MEMPHYS (water ˇCerenkov). In 2011, The LAGUNA

collaboration decided to go ahead to investigate three sites in detail: Fr´ejus hav-

ing the shortest baseline of 130 km, Pyh¨asalmi with the longest baseline (2300

km) and Slanic having baseline of 1500 km. The corresponding detector for

Pyh¨asalmi and Slanic is GLACIER and for Fr´ejus is MEMPHYS. To produce

the beam for the Fr´ejus (130 km) conﬁguration, the 4 MW, 5 GeV HP-SPL pro-

ton driver was assumed. For the other baselines, the 1.6 MW, 50 GeV HP-PS

was considered. For a operation of 200 days per calendar year, the HP-SPL
delivers 1021 POT and the HP-PS yields integrated 3 × 1021 POT per year. In
the past years, study regarding the beam optimisation, detector simulation and

physics potential at the various baselines has been carried out in great detail.

The details of the physics simulation of LBNO can be found in [158, 159].

2.5.4 LBNE

The Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) is a proposed long-baseline

experiment at Fermilab [91]. The proposed detector is a modular 40 kt Liquid

Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) at Sanford Underground Research

Facility (SURF) in South Dakota at a distance 1300 km from the source. The

ﬁrst phase of this will be a 10 kt detector. There will also be a ﬁne-grained

near neutrino detector. Performance of LArTPC is unmatched among massive

detectors for precise spatial and energy resolution and for reconstruction of com-

plex neutrino interactions with high eﬃciency over a broad energy range. It thus

provides a “compact, scalable” approach to achieve sensitivity to the oscillation

13 The other goals of the LAGUNA project are the study of proton decay, galactic supernovae,

terrestrial and solar neutrinos etc [156].

58

Chapter 2. Neutrino Oscillation

physics goals of LBNE [160]. If the LBNE detector is built underground, it will

also be possible for it to observe atmospheric neutrinos. A detailed study on

atmospheric neutrinos at LBNE is presented in [161, 162]. The beam of LBNE

will have a intense on-axis wide-band proﬁle with a beam power of 1.2 GeV.

There are two options being considered for the proton beam 80 GeV and 120

GeV. For a given beam power, proton energy varies inversely with the number of

protons in the beam per unit time. Thus a higher proton energy implies a lower

ﬂux of neutrinos.

Recently there have been discussions to converge the expertise and technical

knowledge of LBNO and LBNE into a uniﬁed endeavor of a long-baseline experi-

ment named DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment) using a Megawatt

beam from Fermilab. One of the major goals of this facility as outlined in [90] is

3σ CP sensitivity for 75% values of δCP .

2.5.5

INO

The India-based neutrino observatory (INO) project is a multi-institutional ef-

fort aimed at building a world-class underground laboratory in India for studying

atmospheric neutrinos in its ﬁrst phase14 [95]. It is sensitive to the atmospheric

neutrinos in the energy range of 1-10 GeV. For this experiment, the detector

will be 50 kt magnetised iron calorimeter (ICAL) which is sensitive to mainly

muon events. ICAL will consist of 5.6 m thick iron plates sandwiched between

151 layers of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs). Iron will act as a target and

the RPCs will serve as the active detector elements. Due to the magnetic ﬁeld

of strength 1.5 Tesla, ICAL will be able to distinguish the µ+ and µ− events in

the GeV energy range. This will make the ICAL detector sensitive towards mea-

suring the neutrino mass hierarchy, which is the primary goal of the ICAL@INO

experiment. Analysis of hierarchy sensitivity of the ICAL detector using only

the muon momentum information can be found in [164]. It is also capable of

reconstructing the hadron energy and average direction of hadron shower. The

14The other physics possibilities of the INO project include study neutrinoless beta decay,

direct dark matter searches etc. [163].

2.5. Salient Features of the Present/Future Generation Oscillation Experiments59

improvement in the sensitivity due to the inclusion of hadrons is discussed in

[165]. Apart from determining the neutrino mass hierarchy, the other physics

goals of the ICAL@INO experiment include measurement of octant of θ23, indi-

rect detection of dark matter, searches for magnetic monopoles, non standard

interactions, Lorentz and CPT violation etc. The site for the INO has been

identiﬁed at Pottipuram in Bodi West hills of Theni District of Tamil Nadu and

the construction is expected to start soon.

2.5.6

IceCube

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a neutrino telescope constructed at the

Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica. The main aim of IceCube is

to study neutrinos from astrophysical sources. IceCube consists of 4800 optical

sensors installed on 80 strings between 1450 m and 2450 m below the surface.

Strings are deployed in a triangular grid pattern with a characteristic spacing

of 125 m enclosing an area of 1 km2 [166]. The IceCube telescope was deployed

in the summer of 2004 and is taking data since 2005. But the evidence of ex-

traterrestrial neutrinos are found just recently.

IceCube observed 37 neutrino

candidate events in the energy range 30 TeV to 2000 TeV [167]. The data in

this energy range can be explained by an E−2 neutrino spectrum with a per-

ﬂavour normalisation (1:1:1). On 4th august 2015 IceCube has observed a 2.3

PeV neutrino event [76] which corresponds to the highest energy neutrino ever

detected.

Chapter 3

Probing Neutrino Oscillation Pa-

rameters in Future Experiments

3.1 Overview

In this chapter we will study the sensitivity reach of the present/future gener-

ation experiments for determining the remaining unknown neutrino oscillation

parameters, namely: (i) the neutrino mass hierarchy, (ii) the octant of the mixing

angle θ23 and (iii) the leptonic CP phase δCP . We will analyse the sensitivities

of the current long-baseline experiments T2K and NOνA, future atmospheric

experiment ICAL@INO and the proposed long-baseline experiments LBNO and

LBNE. We will also analyse the recent data of the IceCube experiment in this

context. This chapter is organised in the following way. In the Section 3.2 we

will study the CP sensitivity of the T2K, NOνA and ICAL experiments. Tak-

ing the projected exposures of T2K and NOνA we will show that the combined

CP sensitivity of T2K and NOνA is limited due to the presence of parameter

degeneracies and we will demonstrate how ICAL@INO can be used as a remedy

of this problem. Next we will explore the CP sensitivity reach of these setups by

taking combinations of diﬀerent exposures. We will present our results in terms

of both discovery of CP violation (CPV) and precision of δCP . We will also

study dependence of CP sensitivity on diﬀerent oscillation parameters and com-

61

62 Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

pare the sensitivities of T2K and NOνA for a given exposure. As the sensitivity

of NOνA and T2K is limited due to shorter baselines and less statistics, it is

necessary to study neutrino oscillations at higher baseline with higher statistics.

In Section 3.3 and 3.4 we will study the potential of the proposed long-baseline

experiments LBNO and LBNE respectively for determining all the three above-

mentioned unknowns. These experiments have longer baselines as compared to

T2K and NOνA and due to huge detector volume and high beam power they

have higher statistics. As the exact conﬁgurations of these experiments are not

yet decided, it is very important to ﬁnd an optimal and economised conﬁguration

for LBNO and LBNE. It is also important to remember that when these exper-

iments will be operational, the data from T2K, NOνA and ICAL experiments

will also be available. Thus, in our analysis, we have calculated the minimum

exposures of LBNO and LBNE for determining hierarchy, octant and CP vio-

lation at a given conﬁdence level in conjunction with T2K, NOνA and ICAL.

We will show that due to the synergy between T2K, NOνA and ICAL, the re-

quired exposures of the LBNO and LBNE experiments are reduced signiﬁcantly.

The reduction of the exposure signiﬁes the fact that the same physics sensitivity

can be obtained with a lower beam power, small detector mass and/or less run-

time. For the LBNE experiment, we will also present results showing the eﬀect

of adding a near detector, the role of the second oscillation maximum and that

of antineutrino runs. We will show that addition of a near detector reduces the

systematic error signiﬁcantly, whereas the second maxima plays a non-trivial role

only in the determination of hierarchy. While studying the role of the antineu-

trinos we ﬁnd that the combination of equal neutrino and antineutrino do not

always gives the best result. In Section 3.5 of this chapter we will study the CP

sensitivity of the IceCube experiment. As we have discussed in the Chapter 1,

the IceCube experiment at south pole is designed mainly for studying neutrinos

from astrophysical sources. While coming from the extragalactic sources, ultra

high energy neutrinos oscillate and due to the very large distance, their mass de-

pendent oscillatory terms average out and they have no explicit dependence on

the oscillation probabilities. Thus in principle it is possible to probe the mixing

3.2. Evidence for Leptonic CP Phase from NOνA, T2K and ICAL

63

parameters in the IceCube events irrespective of the value of the neutrino mass.

In our analysis, we have investigated the possibility of constraining the leptonic

phase δCP from the recent IceCube data. We show that in the oscillations of the

ultra high energy neutrinos δCP have a very weak dependence and thus it is not

possible to put any constraint on δCP with signiﬁcant conﬁdence level. But we

found that the results signiﬁcantly depend on the initial sources of the neutrinos.

We will present the results showing how the properties of diﬀerent sources can

be constrained from this data. Finally we will summarize all the results of this

chapter in Section 3.6.

3.2 Evidence for Leptonic CP Phase from NOνA,

T2K and ICAL

In this section, we study the potential for measuring CP phase δCP in the current

generation long-baseline experiments T2K, NOνA and the atmospheric neutrino

oscillation experiment ICAL@INO. In the PMNS matrix, δCP is associated with

θ13. Thus a non-zero θ13 is required for any measurement of δCP . The 10σ

signature for non-zero θ13 leads naturally to the question to what extent CPV

discovery is possible by the current superbeam experiments T2K and NOνA

and/or with how much precision a true value of δCP can be measured. In these
experiments, the sensitivity to δCP comes mainly from the νµ − νe (and ν µ − νe)
oscillation probability, Pµe ( ¯Pµe) which are sensitive to δCP . But as discussed

in Chapter 2, the measurement of any oscillation parameter is diﬃcult due to

the presence of parameter degeneracies as the correct signal can also be faked by

a wrong solutions due to hierarchy-δCP and octant-δCP degeneracy. In [154], it

was shown that a prior knowledge of the hierarchy facilitates the measurement of

δCP by NOνA and T2K. However, the determination of the hierarchy by NOνA

and T2K itself suﬀers from being dependent on the ‘true’ value of δCP in nature.
For the favourable combinations ({δCP ∈ [−180◦, 0◦], NH} or {δCP ∈ [0◦, 180◦],
IH}), NOνA and T2K will be able to determine the hierarchy at 90% C.L. with
their planned runs. But their hierarchy determination ability and hence their

64 Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

CP sensitivity will be poor if nature has chosen the unfavourable combinations

[168]. The octant determination capability of T2K and NOνA are also aﬀected

due to the completely unknown value of δCP [147]. For the case of neutrinos,
δCP ∈ [−180◦, 0◦] is the favourable (unfavourable) half-plane for determination
of octant if θ23 belongs in HO (LO) and δCP ∈ [0◦, 180◦] is the favourable (un-
favourable) half-plane for determination of octant if θ23 belongs to LO (HO).

This is opposite for the case of antineutrinos. So to have a octant sensitivity

for all δCP values, a balanced neutrino and antineutrino run is required. On

the other hand, the hierarchy and octant sensitivities of atmospheric neutrino

experiments, for example ICAL, are independent of δCP [129, 169]. Hence, a

combination of long-baseline (LBL) and atmospheric data would be able to en-

hance the hierarchy and octant sensitivity for the δCP values which are adverse

for the LBL experiments. This can substantially improve the ability of the LBL

experiments to measure δCP in the unfavourable regions of.

This section is organised as follows. First we will give the necessary exper-

imental details of T2K, NOνA and ICAL, used in our simulations and brieﬂy

describe the the method of χ2 analysis1. Next we present the CP sensitivity of

the combined T2K and NOνA experiments by taking their projected exposures

and show that the CP sensitivity of these experiments are compromised due to

the hierarchy-δCP and the octant-δCP degeneracy. Next we demonstrate that,

though ICAL do not have its own CP sensitivity but still the CP sensitivity of

T2K and NOνA can be enhanced signiﬁcantly by including ICAL data in the

analysis. Then we expand our discussions by studying synergies between these

setups and dependence of diﬀerent oscillation parameters by taking diﬀerent ex-

posures of T2K, NOνA and ICAL.

3.2.1 Experimental Speciﬁcation

For our study we simulate NOνA and T2K using the GLoBES package [89, 123,

139, 155, 168, 170–175]. For NOνA, we have assumed a 14 kt totally active

scintillator detector (TASD) and a neutrino beam having power of 0.7 MW.

1We will explain the method of calculating χ2 in detail in the appendix.

3.2. Evidence for Leptonic CP Phase from NOνA, T2K and ICAL

65

We have used a re-optimised NOνA set-up with reﬁned event selection criteria
[168, 176]. T2K is assumed to have a 22.5 kt water ˇCerenkov detector and a 0.77

MW beam. This beam power correspond to a 1021 POT per year. In our analysis

we give the exposures of NOνA/T2K as a+b where a and b denote the number of

years of neutrino and antineutrino running of the experiments respectively. For

these experiments, we have used the systematic errors and background rejection

eﬃciencies as used in Ref. [168, 176].

For atmospheric neutrinos we consider ICAL@INO with a proposed mass of

50 kt. The detector is capable of detecting muon events with charge identiﬁ-

cation [95]. For our analysis we use neutrino energy and angular resolutions of

(10%, 10◦) unless noted otherwise. These are representative values giving similar

sensitivity as obtained in [165] using the informations of both muons and hadrons

in the simulation.

Now let us discuss brieﬂy about our treatment of systematic errors. For the

ICAL experiment we have considered the following ﬁve sources of systematic

errors: (i) 20% ﬂux normalisation error, (ii) tilt error [177] which includes the

eﬀect of deviation of the atmospheric ﬂuxes from a power law, (iii) 5% zenith

angle uncertainty, (iv) 10% cross section error and (v) an overall systematic

uncertainty of 5%. But for our simulation of the long-baseline experiments we

have used an overall normalisation error and an overall tilt error as used in the

references mentioned above. In our analysis we have implemented the systematic

errors by the method of pulls [177, 178]. We will discuss this method in the

appendix.

3.2.2 Details of the Simulation

In our analysis, we give the sensitivity of the experiments in terms of χ2. The

statistical χ2 for a Gaussian distribution2 is deﬁned as

χ2

stat = min

(Nex − Nth)2

Nex

,

(3.1)

2If the number of events are very less then we use the Poisson χ2 formula. See appendix

for detail.

66 Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

where Nex and Nth are the number of true (corresponds to data) and test

(corresponds to theory) events respectively.

In our calculation we include a

marginalisation over the systematic errors by the method of pulls. The resultant

χ2 from the various experiments are then added and ﬁnally marginalised over

the test parameters over their allowed 3σ range. We have added the external

(projected) information on θ13 from the reactor experiments in the form of a

prior on θ13:

χ2

prior = (cid:18) sin2 2θtr

13 − sin2 2θ13

σ(sin2 2θ13)

(cid:19)2

,

(3.2)

where σ(sin2 2θ13) is the 1σ error of sin2 2θ13.

For the analysis of CP sensitivity we will use two kinds of χ2 which are deﬁned

in the following way3:

(i) The CP violation discovery χ2

χ2

stat = min

(Nex(δtr

CP = 0, 180◦))2
CP ) − Nth(δtest
Nex(δtr
CP )

(3.3)

which is the potential of an experiment to diﬀerentiate a true value of δCP from

the CP conserving values 0◦ and 180◦. This is obtained by varying δCP in the

true spectrum and keeping it ﬁxed in 0◦ and 180◦ in the test spectrum. As

expected, the CP violation discovery potential of the experiments is zero for true
δCP = 0◦ and 180◦, while it is close to maximum at the maximally CP violating
values δCP = ±90◦.

(ii) The CP precision χ2

χ2

stat = min

(Nex(δtr

CP ) − Nth(δtest
Nex(δtr

CP )

CP ))2

(3.4)

which describes how well an experiment can exclude the wrong δCP values other

than the true values. This is obtained by varying δCP in the test spectrum over
the full range [−180◦, 180◦) for each value of true δCP . We will present our CP
sensitivity results in the δCP (true) − δCP (test) plane.

In our analysis we use the following transformations relating the eﬀective

measured values of the atmospheric parameters ∆µµ and θµµ to their natural

3For simplicity we give the diagnostics in terms of χ2

(3.5)

(3.6)

The eﬀective values ∆µµ and θµµ correspond to parameters measured by muon

disappearance experiments.

It is advocated to use these values in the deﬁni-

tions of priors if the prior is taken from muon disappearance measurements. The

corrected deﬁnition of θµµ is signiﬁcant due to the large measured value of θ13,

while for ∆µµ the above transformation would be relevant even for small θ13

values. In our analysis we do not use any external priors for these parameters

as the experiments themselves are sensitive to these parameters. However it is

to be noted that for the eﬀective parameters, there is an exact mass hierarchy
degeneracy between ∆µµ and (−∆µµ) and an exact intrinsic octant degeneracy
between θµµ and (90◦ − θµµ). Therefore use of these values in the analysis en-
sures that one hits the exact minima for the wrong hierarchy and wrong octant

in the numerical analysis for the muon disappearance channel. Measurements

with the appearance channel and the presence of matter eﬀects can break these

degeneracies. Also, the generalised octant degeneracy occurring between values

of θµµ in opposite octants for diﬀerent values of θ13 and δCP is still present for

the eﬀective atmospheric mixing angle. For such cases, a ﬁne marginalisation

grid has to be used in the analysis in order to capture the χ2 minima occurring

in the wrong hierarchy and wrong octant.

For our analysis, we have ﬁxed the solar parameters θ12 and ∆21 to their

current best-ﬁt values as obtained from the recent global ﬁts [19, 124, 125] in both

true and test spectrum. We have taken true value of sin2 2θ13 = 0.1 throughout
our analysis and added a 5% prior on sin2 2θ13 which is the expected precision
from the current reactor experiments. True value of ∆µµ is taken as +(−)2.4 ×
10−3 eV2 for NH (IH). In the test spectrum, we have marginalised θµµ in the
range 35◦ to 55◦ and |∆µµ| from 2.19 × 10−3 eV2 to 2.61 × 10−3 eV2. We have
also marginalised hierarchy in the test spectrum unless otherwise mentioned.

3.2.3 CP Sensitivity of T2K and NOνA with Their Pro-

jected Exposure

In Fig. 3.1, we plot the combined CPV discovery potential (as deﬁned in Eq.

3.3), of the LBL experiments NOνA and T2K4. In these plots we have considered

NOνA running for 3 years in neutrino mode and 3 years in antineutrino mode

i.e., NOνA(3+3) according to the planned run time of NOνA. For T2K we have
considered a total exposure of 8 × 1021 POT, which is the projected exposure of
T2K. We consider T2K running only in neutrino mode. As our ﬂux corresponds

to 1021 POT per year, this corresponds to 8 years running of T2K i.e., T2K(8+0).

Though currently T2K is also running in the antineutrino mode, in our analysis

we have not considered the antineutrino run of T2K because when T2K is com-

bined with NOνA(3+3), the pure neutrino run and equal neutrino-antineutrino

run of T2K give almost similar sensitivity. We will discuss this point in more

detail in Section ??.

3.2. Evidence for Leptonic CP Phase from NOνA, T2K and ICAL

discovery of NOνA+T2K suﬀers a drop in one of the half-planes of δCP for all the

three values of θµµ. The drop is in the region [0◦, 180◦] (upper half-plane: UHP)
if it is NH, and [−180◦, 0◦] (lower half-plane: LHP) if it is IH. These are the un-
favourable half-planes corresponding to the hierarchy-δCP degeneracy where the

χ2 minima occurs with the wrong hierarchy5. Here we can see that the results

depend signiﬁcantly on the true value of θµµ. As hierarchy sensitivity increases

with θµµ, the CP sensitivity of the unfavourable half-planes increases with in-

creasing θµµ. But on the other hand CP sensitivity decreases with increasing

θµµ in the favourable half-planes. We will discuss the reason for this in Section
??. There is also a drop around δCP = −90◦ for true NH and θ23 = 39◦. This
occurs because of the presence of octant-δCP degeneracy. As discussed earlier

(see Fig. 2.9), the octant-δCP degeneracy occurs in LO-LHP for neutrinos and

absent in antineutrinos. As in these plots we have considered T2K(8+0) and

NOνA(3+3), the neutrino run dominates and thus the wrong octant solution
appears at δCP = −90◦ for true NH and θ23 = 39◦.

From these plots we observe that with the projected exposure of T2K and
NOνA, 3σ CPV sensitivity can be achieved only around δCP = −90◦(+90◦) if
true hierarchy is NH (IH).

3.2.4 CP Sensitivity of Atmospheric Neutrinos

Now let us discuss the CP sensitivity of the atmospheric neutrino experiment

ICAL. The muon events in atmospheric neutrinos get contributions from both

Pµµ and Peµ. In these probabilities, the δCP -dependent term always appears along

with a factor of cos ∆ or sin ∆ (cf. Eq. 2.101). In atmospheric neutrinos, the

baseline is associated with the direction of the incoming neutrinos or the zenith

angle θz. If we consider even a 10% error range in the zenith angle and energy of

the neutrino, the oscillating term varies over an entire cycle in this range. As a

result, the δCP -sensitivity of the channel gets washed out because of smearing. In
Fig. 3.2, we have plotted the quantity S = Sµ + Sµ in the E − cos θz plane, which
5Henceforth the favourable and unfavourable half-planes that are mentioned throughout

this chapter will correspond to that with respect to the hierarchy-δCP degeneracy.

is a measure of the δCP -sensitivity of the atmospheric neutrino experiment. Here,

Sµ = (δNµ)2/Nµ(avg), where δNµ is the maximum diﬀerence in the number of

events obtained by varying δCP and Nµ(avg) is the average number of events

over all values of δCP (and likewise Sµ for µ events). The quantity S is thus a

measure of the maximum possible relative variation in events due to δCP in each

bin. In the left panel, we show the results for an ideal detector with an exposure

of 500 kt yr, with inﬁnite energy and angular precision. Here we see substantial

sensitivity to δCP , with S exceeding 0.5 in some bins [182]. However, when we

introduce realistic resolutions (10◦ in angle and 10% in energy), we see from the

right panel of Fig. 3.2 that the sensitivity is lost. To study this point in more

detail, we investigate how the intrinsic CP sensitivity of atmospheric neutrinos

depend on the energy and angular resolutions and how much sensitivity can be

achieved for an ideal detector. In Fig. 3.3 the CP violation discovery potential of

ICAL is plotted as a function of the energy and angular resolution. The curve for

angular (energy) resolution is plotted by varying the respective smearing widths
between 3◦ − 15◦ (3%− 15%) while holding the energy (angular) resolution ﬁxed

at 10%(10◦). The ﬁgure illustrates the signiﬁcant role played by the angular

resolution of an atmospheric neutrino detector in controlling the CP sensitivity.

With present realistic values of detector smearing (15%,15◦), the CP sensitivity of

such an experiment is washed out by averaging over bins in energy and direction,

due to the coupling between δCP and ∆ = ∆31L/4E in the term cos(δCP + ∆)

in Pµe. With a hypothetical improved angular resolution of 3◦, the CP violation

discovery χ2 may reach values close to 1, going up to 5 for an ideal detector with

no smearing.

Thus atmospheric neutrino experiments by themselves are not sensitive to

δCP . For beam experiments, since the direction of the neutrinos is known, angular

smearing is not needed and hence the sensitivity to δCP is not compromised due

to this reason.

3.2.5 Eﬀect of ICAL on the CP Sensitivity of T2K and

NOνA

In this section we discuss the combined CP sensitivity of the T2K, NOνA and

ICAL detectors. Previously we have seen that CP sensitivity of T2K and NOνA

72 Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

is compromised due to unknown hierarchy and octant. An atmospheric neutrino

detector like ICAL gives hierarchy and octant sensitivity which is remarkably

stable over the entire range of δCP , even though it does not oﬀer any signiﬁcant

CPV discovery potential by itself. Thus the hierarchy and octant sensitivity of

the atmospheric neutrinos can exclude the wrong solutions for CPV discovery.

mass hierarchy.

In Fig. 3.4 we have plotted the combined CP sensitivity of NOνA+T2K+ICAL.

Left panel is for true NH and right panel is for true IH. In these ﬁgures we see

that when the information of ICAL is added to NOνA+T2K, the χ2 in the un-

favourable region increases signiﬁcantly. For NH and θ23 = 39◦, the shape of the

curve shows that the sensitivity of ICAL is not suﬃcient to rule out the wrong

hierarchy minima completely for δCP = 90◦. We also observe that after the

addition of ICAL data, the θµµ dependence in the unfavourable region becomes

similar to that of favourable region. The wrong octant solution for NH, θ23 = 39◦
and δCP = −90◦ also vanishes. The advantage oﬀered by combining ICAL with
the LBL data is most prominent for θ23 = 39◦ and progressively diminishes with

increasing θ23. In general, the atmospheric neutrino contribution to the CPV dis-

covery potential of NOνA+T2K+ICAL is eﬀective till the wrong solutions are

disfavoured and the minimum comes with the true hierarchy and octant. Once

3.2. Evidence for Leptonic CP Phase from NOνA, T2K and ICAL

73

that is achieved, a further increase in the sensitivity of atmospheric neutrinos will

not aﬀect the CPV discovery results, since atmospheric neutrinos by themselves

do not have CPV sensitivity for realistic resolutions. From the ﬁgures we can see
that for true NH (IH), T2K+NOνA can discover CPV at 2σ for ∼ 28%(29%)
fraction of δCP values for θµµ = 39◦. By adding ICAL information, this improves
to ∼ 58%. For maximal CPV (δCP = ±90◦), inclusion of ICAL gives a ∼ 3σ
signal for both hierarchies. Without the ICAL contribution this is true only in

one of the half-planes depending on the hierarchy.

To study the eﬀect of ICAL detector resolutions on the results, we plot in Fig.

3.5 the CPV discovery potential of NOνA+T2K+ICAL for θµµ = 39◦ and true

NH assuming two sets of energy and angular smearing for ICAL – (15%,15◦) and

(10%,10◦). In the former case, an indication of CPV at 2σ is seen to be achieved

around δCP = +90◦ but the improvement in the CP sensitivity is very less. For

the latter (better) smearing set, though the χ2 minimum still comes with the

wrong hierarchy but the sensitivity increases signiﬁcantly in the unfavourable

half-plane. An improvement in the resolution beyond (10%,10◦) can improve the

CP sensitivity even more by excluding the wrong hierarchy solution completely.
For δCP = −90◦, the drop due to the wrong octant solution is no longer visible

after adding the ICAL data with (15%,15◦) resolution. Since the wrong solution

is already removed, there is no further improvement in the CP sensitivity for this

value of δCP when the ICAL resolution improved to (10%,10◦).

In order to gauge the contribution from ICAL with a reduced exposure, we

plot in Fig. 3.6 the CPV discovery as a function of δCP for NOνA+T2K and

NOνA+T2K+ICAL for two ICAL exposures, 250 kt yr and 500 kt yr for θµµ =

3.2.6 A Chronological Study of δCP Using T2K, NOνA

and ICAL

In this section we further explore the CPV discovery potential of T2K and NOνA

using diﬀerent run times. We also use exposure beyond that projected in order to

assess the capabilities of these experiments with enhanced statistics. In addition

to CPV discovery, we will present the results for δCP precision in δCP (true)

vs δCP (test) plane. We will also study the eﬀect of ICAL in improving the

3.2. Evidence for Leptonic CP Phase from NOνA, T2K and ICAL

75

CP sensitivity of T2K and NOνA. For our study we will consider the following

exposures of T2K, NOνA and ICAL:

• 5 year run of T2K: either (5+0) conﬁguration or (3+2) conﬁguration and

10 year run of T2K in (5+5) conﬁguration.

• For NOνA we will take either (3+3) or (5+5) conﬁguration.

• For ICAL we will consider either 5 year (250 kt yr) or 10 year (500 kt yr)

exposure.

For detail see [183].

In Table 3.1 we summarize the maximum values of CP violation discovery

potential, and the percentage of true δCP values capable of giving a CP violation

discovery signal at 2σ and 3σ, for diﬀerent combinations of the experiments T2K,

NOνA and ICAL. From the table we see that, with the projected exposure, the

combination of T2K and NOνA gives 2σ CPV discovery sensitivity for 28%

fraction of total δCP values and 3σ CPV discovery sensitivity for 5% fraction of

total δCP values. With the inclusion of ICAL, the sensitivity improves to 58%

and 24% for 2σ and 3σ respectively. If one considers the most optimistic run

times for these experiments i.e., the T2K(5+5) and NOνA(5+5) conﬁgurations,

then also with the inclusion of 10 year data of ICAL gives a maximum CPV

discovery sensitivity corresponding to a fraction of 62% for 2σ and 36% for 3σ

of the total δCP values.

From these results we understand that, to establish CPV (as well as CP preci-

sion) at higher conﬁdence level, covering larger fraction of δCP values, one needs

experiments more powerful than T2K and NOνA. This is also true for determin-

ing hierarchy and octant. In [147, 154] it has been shown that the combination of

T2K and NOνA is not sensitive enough to determine hierarchy and octant with

a very high conﬁdence level. To achieve higher sensitivity, several experiments

have been proposed which will have comparatively longer baselines and powerful

neutrino beams. The projects LBNO and LBNE are the examples of such pro-

posed long-baseline experiments. LBNO is an European project where neutrinos

Fermilab will generate the neutrinos. As the exact design of these experiments

are still under consideration, one needs to carry out a detail analysis to ﬁnd out

the optimal conﬁguration for measuring the oscillation parameter with greater

conﬁdence level.

In the next two sections we will study the physics potential

of the LBNO and LBNE experiments and ﬁnd out their optimal exposure to

determine the unknown neutrino oscillation parameters.

3.3. Physics Potential of LBNO in Conjunction with T2K, NOνA and ICAL 77

3.3 Physics Potential of LBNO in Conjunction

with T2K, NOνA and ICAL

In this section, we will discuss the contributions of NOνA, T2K, ICAL@INO

and LBNO towards determining the mass hierarchy, octant of θ23 as well as for

discovery of CP violation. As the precise conﬁguration of LBNO is under con-

sideration, our aim is to determine the conﬁguration for LBNO with ‘adequate’

exposure in conjunction with T2K, NOνA and ICAL, which can determine the

unknown oscillation parameters. The ‘adequate’ conﬁguration is deﬁned as one

with the minimal exposure which would give a 5σ discovery potential for hierar-

chy and octant and 3σ discovery potential for δCP in the most unfavourable case.

This conﬁguration can be viewed as the ﬁrst step in a staged approach that has

been advocated by previous studies [184].

The plan of this section is as follows. First we give the experimental speciﬁca-

tions that we have used for the proposed LBNO experiment and other simulation

details. The next three subsections thereafter are devoted to the analysis of the

experimental reach of the combination of experiments for determining the mass

hierarchy, octant of θ23 and discovery of CP violation respectively.

3.3.1 Experimental Speciﬁcations and Other Simulation

Details

Out of the various possible options for the LBNO experiment as described in

chapter 2 , we consider the following three options that are prominent in the lit-

erature: CERN-Pyh¨asalmi, CERN-Slanic and CERN-Fr´ejus. The speciﬁcations

that we have used in this study are listed below in Table 3.2. We have used the

superbeam ﬂuxes from Ref. [185].

For NOνA, T2K and ICAL we consider the same speciﬁcation as mentioned

in section 3.2. For NOνA we have considered an equal 3 year running in both

neutrino and antineutrino mode. For T2K we assumed a total exposure corre-
sponding to 8 × 1021 POT running in completely neutrino mode and we have

78 Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

taken 10 year running of ICAL, which corresponds to a total exposure of 500

kt-yr.

Table 3.2: Experimental characteristics of the LBNO options.

We have ﬁxed the ‘true’ values of the parameters close to the values obtained
from global ﬁts of world neutrino data. We have taken: sin2 θ12 = 0.304, |∆31| =
2.4 × 10−3 eV2, ∆21 = 7.65 × 10−5 eV2 and sin2 2θ13 = 0.1. Three representative
true values of θ23 have been considered – 39◦, 45◦ and 51◦ (except in the case

of octant determination where a wider range and more intermediate values have

been included). The true value of δCP is varied in its entire allowed range. All

our results are shown for both NH and IH. The ‘test’ values of the parameters are
allowed to vary in the following ranges – θ23 ∈ [35◦, 55◦], sin2 2θ13 ∈ [0.085, 0.115],
δCP ∈ [0, 360◦). The test hierarchy is also allowed to run over both possibilities.
We have imposed a prior on the value of sin2 2θ13 with an error σ(sin2 2θ13) =

0.005. We have however not imposed any prior on the atmospheric parameters,

instead allowing the νµ disappearance channels to restrict their range. In all our

simulations, we have taken into account the three-ﬂavour-corrected deﬁnitions of

the atmospheric parameters [179–181] as given in Eqs. 3.5 and 3.6.

The aim of this exercise is to determine the least exposure required from

LBNO in order to determine hierarchy and octant with a statistical signiﬁcance

corresponding to χ2 = 25 and that CP violation detected with χ2 = 9 for 20%

value of δCP

violation for various diﬀerent exposures of LBNO, combined with NOνA, T2K

and INO. From this, we estimate the adequate amount of exposure required by

LBNO. We express the exposure in units of POT-kt. This is a product of three

experimental quantities:

exposure (POT-kt) = beam intensity (POT/yr)×runtime (yr)×detector mass (kt) .

(3.7)

Thus, a given value of exposure can be achieved experimentally by adjusting the

intensity, runtime and detector mass. The advantage of using this measure is

that while the physics goals are expressed in terms of simply one number (the

exposure), the experimental implementation of this exposure can be attained by

various combinations of beam, detector and runtime settings. For example, an
exposure of 45× 1021 POT-kt could be achieved with a 1.5× 1021 POT/yr beam
running for 3 years with a 10 kt detector or a 3 × 1021 POT/yr beam running
for 3 years with a 5 kt detector. According to our terminology, the exposures

given correspond to each mode (neutrino and antineutrino). Thus, a runtime of

n years implies n years each in neutrino and antineutrino mode totaling to 2n

years.

3.3.2 Determination of Mass Hierarchy

Among the three chosen prospective baselines for LBNO, the 130 km set-up

has the lowest hierarchy sensitivity due to small matter eﬀects. As the baseline

increases, the hierarchy sensitivity becomes better because of enhanced matter

eﬀects.

In particular, the 2290 km set-up has the unique advantage of being

close to satisfying the bimagic conditions [151–153](cf. Section 2.4.1). This fea-

ture makes the baseline particularly suited for hierarchy determination. The

above features are reﬂected in Fig. 3.7.

In each of the panels of Fig. 3.7,

the lowermost densely-dotted (black) curve shows the hierarchy sensitivity of

the combination NOνA+T2K+ICAL. We see that these experiments can col-

it was recently pointed out in Refs. [187, 188] that for a binary question such as hierarchy, the

relation between χ2 and conﬁdence levels is somewhat involved. For more recent discussions

on statistical interpretation, see Refs. [159, 189, 190].

our aims, we need to determine the minimum exposure for LBNO, such that

the combination NOνA+T2K+ICAL+LBNO crosses the threshold of χ2 = 25

for all values of δCP . For this, we have plotted the combined sensitivity of

NOνA+T2K+ICAL+LBNO for various values of LBNO exposure (in units of

1021 POT-kt). The results are shown for two baselines – 2290 km and 1540

[92], for the same beam power and oscillation parameters. For

the baseline of 130 km, it is not possible to cross χ2 = 25 even with extremely

high exposure. Therefore we have not shown the corresponding plots for this

baseline. We considered three true values of θ23 – 39◦, 45◦, 51◦ and chose the χ2

corresponding to the least favourable of these in generating the ﬁgures. Thus,

our results represent the most conservative case. We ﬁnd that in most cases, the

minimum χ2 for hierarchy determination occurs for true θ23 = 39◦.

Finally, in Fig. 3.8, we have condensed all this information into a single plot.

exposure. We see that for 2290 (1540) km, it is suﬃcient for LBNO to have an
exposure of around 7 × 1021 (21 × 1021) POT-kt in order to get a χ2 = 25 for all
values of δCP . Along the upper edge of the graph, we have provided an additional

axis, which denotes the total POT required if we assume that the detector has a
mass of 10 kt. For 2290 (1540) km, we need a total of 0.7×1021 (2.1×1021) POT.
To get some idea of the time scale involved we consider for instance the beam
intensity used in Ref. [184] which corresponds to 3 × 1021 POT/yr delivered by

82 Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

a 50 GeV proton beam from CERN with beam power 1.6 MW. The total POT
of 0.7× 1021 for a 10 kt detector at the 2290 (1540) km baseline would thus need
less than 1 (2) years (total, inclusive of ν and ν runs) to establish mass hierarchy

with χ2 = 25.

Thus, for the same beam intensity one can achieve the same sensitivity with a 7

kt detector. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the 1540 km set-up. It should

be noted that the numbers in Fig. 3.9 are sample values at which the simulations

are performed. The exposure required for each set-up to attain the ‘adequate’

values can be read oﬀ from Fig. 3.8 and is presented in Table 3.3.

3.3.3 Determination of Octant of θ23

The octant sensitivity of long-baseline experiments has been studied in detail

recently in [147, 191] and also in conjunction with atmospheric neutrino exper-

iments [169]. As in the case of hierarchy, adding information from various ex-

periments enhances the sensitivity. However, the precise knowledge of the value

of θ13 also plays a very crucial role in enhancing the octant sensitivity [130].

In Fig. 3.10, the lowermost densely-dotted (black) curve denotes the ability of

of θ23 in nature. Again, the other curves denote the combined sensitivity of

range of exposures considered, it is possible to get a χ2 = 25 sensitivity to the
octant as long as θ23 deviates from maximality by at least ∼ 6◦.

value of θ23 to be 39◦. Because of the better performance of NOνA+T2K+ICAL

when NH is true, the adequate exposure for LBNO is higher when IH is true.

Given our current state of ignorance about the true hierarchy in nature, we give

the χ2 for the worst case i.e.,we present the octant sensitivity results (cf. Table

3.3) for the hierarchy that requires a higher exposure. The ﬁg shows that it is
suﬃcient to have an exposure of around 83 × 1021 POT-kt to reach χ2 = 25 for
both the baselines. The upper axis shows the total POT required, with a 10 kt
detector. For instance, we see that 8.3 × 1021 POT is suﬃcient if we have a 10
kt detector. This translates to a runtime of a little under 3 years in each ν and
ν mode, given an intensity of 3 × 1021 POT/yr.

is much higher than that for the other two baselines. However, for a large mass

detector like MEMPHYS that is being planned for the Fr´ejus site, this exposure

is not diﬃcult to attain. The sensitivity as a function of LBNO exposure for
this baseline is shown in Fig. 3.13. We need an exposure of around 400 × 1021
POT-kt in this case. For this graph, the upper axis shows the required POT if

we consider a 500 kt detector, as proposed for MEMPHYS [186]. We see that for
such a large mass detector, only around 0.8 × 1021 POT is adequate to exclude
the octant for θ23 = 39◦.

Fig. 3.14 shows the synergy between LBL experiments and ICAL. In the

left (right) panel, we have chosen the LBNO baseline of 2290 (1540) km to

illustrate this point. IH is assumed to be the true hierarchy. The sensitivity of

T2K+NOνA alone (densely-dotted, black curve) is enhanced by adding data from

ICAL and LBNO. The solid (red) curve in the left panel shows that an exposure
of 82.5 × 1021 POT-kt is enough to determine the octant with χ2 = 25 at 39◦.
But without ICAL data (dashed, blue curve), the sensitivity would be lower.

the advantage of adding atmospheric neutrino data.

We see in Fig. 3.15 that with NOνA+T2K+ICAL, only around χ2 = 4 can
be attained, for a small range of δCP values around ±90◦. Adding LBNO (2290
km and 1540 km) data with increasing exposure can enhance this and can even

help to achieve χ2 = 9 for CP detection for some range of δCP . In Fig. 3.16,

we have plotted the fraction of δCP for which CP violation can be detected with

χ2 = 9, as a function of the LBNO exposure. As an example, if we aim to detect

It can also be seen from the ﬁgure that with 350 × 1021 POT-kt exposure, the
maximum CP fraction for which a 3σ sensitivity is achievable ranges from 30% to
40%. The upper axis shows that these values correspond to 24× 1021 (17× 1021)

see that an exposure much higher than the longer baselines is required. In this
case, CP detection for 20% δCP values requires an exposure of around 35 × 1021

can also be used to collect atmospheric neutrino data [192], which can further

enhance the sensitivity because of the ability of the atmospheric neutrinos to

rule out the wrong hierarchy solutions.

Figure 3.19: CP detection sensitivity χ2 for diﬀerent combinations of exper-

(dashed, blue), the sensitivity is lower than for T2K+NOνA+LBNO+ICAL (red,

stantially (dotted, green) in order to get comparable sensitivity. All the plotted

that with only T2K+NOνA (densely-dotted, black curve), one suﬀers from the

hierarchy-δCP degeneracy in the unfavourable region of δCP . This degeneracy

is lifted by adding information from other experiments. On adding data from
ICAL and 16.7 × 1021 POT-kt of LBNO (solid, red curve), we just reach χ2 = 9
sensitivity. With the same LBNO exposure, absence of ICAL data reduces the

detection reach, as seen from the dashed (blue) curve. Reaching χ2 = 9 without

ICAL will require the LBNO exposure to be doubled, as the dotted (green) curve

92 Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

shows. Thus ICAL plays a signiﬁcant role in δCP measurement for this baseline.

For the two longer baselines, LBNO even with very low exposure in conjunction

with T2K and NOνA can break the hierarchy-δCP degeneracy by excluding the

wrong hierarchy solution. Therefore, the contribution of ICAL towards detecting

CP violation becomes redundant in this case.

3.4 Physics Potential of LBNE in Conjunction

with T2K, NOνA and ICAL

In this section, we explore the sensitivity reach of the LBNE experiment in deter-

mining the remaining unknowns in neutrino oscillation, in combination with the

other experiments T2K, NOνA and ICAL. In our study we carry out a similar

analysis as that of LBNO i.e., we determine the most conservative speciﬁcations

that this experiment needs, in order to measure the remaining unknown param-

eters to a speciﬁed level of precision. Addition to that, we will also study the

eﬀect of near detector in constraining systematic error, the role of second os-

cillation maxima. We will also present an optimisation study of neutrino and

antineutrino run of LBNE.

3.4.1 Experimental Speciﬁcations and Other Simulation

Details

As mentioned in chapter 3.3 for LBNE, there are two options being considered

for the proton beam - 80 GeV and 120 GeV. In our study, we have chosen the 120

GeV proton beam. As the neutrino ﬂux decreases with proton energy, this gives

us a lower ﬂux of neutrinos and hence a conservative estimate of our results.

The speciﬁcations for the liquid argon detector have been taken from Ref.

[91]. In this study we use the ﬂux corresponding to 1.2 MW beam power [193].

However we give our results in terms of MW-kt-yr. This will enable one to

interpret the results in terms of varying detector volume, timescale and beam

power. Note that although we use the ﬂux corresponding to 1.2 MW beam power,

3.4. Physics Potential of LBNE in Conjunction with T2K, NOνA and ICAL 93

if the accelerator geometry remains the same, then the change in the value of

the beam power will proportionally change the ﬂux. Therefore, the ﬂux for a

diﬀerent value of beam power can be obtained by simply scaling the ‘standard’

ﬂux ﬁle by the appropriate factor.

The speciﬁcations for T2K, NOνA and ICAL is same as that of LBNO anal-

ysis.

In the analyses that follow, we have evaluated the χ2 for determining the

mass hierarchy, octant of θ23 and CP violation using a combination of LBNE

and the current/upcoming experiments T2K, NOνA and ICAL. For each set of

‘true’ values assumed, we evaluate the χ2 marginalised over the ‘test’ parameters.

For true θ23, we have considered three values – 39◦, 45◦ and 51◦ which are within

the current 3σ allowed range. The systematic uncertainties are parametrised in

terms of four nuisance parameters – signal normalisation error (2.5%), signal tilt

error (2.5%), background normalisation error (10%) and background tilt error

(2.5%).

To economise the conﬁguration of LBNE with the help of the current genera-

tion of experiments, We evaluate the ‘adequate’ exposure for LBNE. The qualiﬁer

‘adequate’, as deﬁned in the context of LBNO, means the exposure required from

the experiment to determine the hierarchy and octant with χ2 = 25, and to de-

tect CP violation with χ2 = 9. To do so, we have varied the exposure of LBNE,

and determined the combined sensitivity of LBNE along with T2K, NOνA and

ICAL. The variation of total sensitivity with LBNE exposure tells us what the

adequate exposure should be. In this study, we have quantiﬁed the exposure for

LBNE in units of MW-kt-yr. This is a product of the beam power (in MW), the

runtime of the experiment (in years) 9 and the detector mass (in kilotons). As

a phenomenological study, we will only specify the total exposure. This may be

interpreted experimentally as diﬀerent combinations of beam power, runtime and

detector mass whose product quantiﬁes the exposure. For example, an exposure

9A runtime of n years is to be interpreted as n years each in neutrino and antineutrino

mode. In this study, we have always considered equal runs in both modes for LBNE unless

otherwise mentioned.

Figure 3.20: Hierarchy (Octant) sensitivity χ2 vs LBNE exposure, for both hier-

archies in the left (middle) panel. The value of exposure shown here is adequate

to exclude the wrong hierarchy for all values of δCP . Two additional sets of

curves are shown to show the fall in χ2 without data from ICAL, and the hierar-

chy sensitivity of LBNE alone. The right panel shows the fraction of δCP range

for which it is possible to exclude the CP conserving cases of 0 and 180◦, at the

of 20 MW-kt-yr could be achieved by using a 10 kt detector for 2 years (in each,

ν and ν mode), with a 1 MW beam. We use events in the energy range 0.5 - 8

GeV for LBNE which covers both ﬁrst and second oscillation maxima.

3.4.2 Adequate Exposure for LBNE

3.4.2.1 Hierarchy Sensitivity

In the left panel of Fig. 3.20, we have shown the combined sensitivity of LBNE,

NOνA, T2K and ICAL for determining the mass hierarchy, as the exposure for

LBNE is varied. Note that the hierarchy sensitivity depends very strongly on

the true value of δCP and θ23. In this study, as in LBNO, we are interested in

ﬁnding out the least exposure needed for LBNE, irrespective of the true values of

the parameters in nature. Therefore, we have evaluated the χ2 for various true

values of these parameters, and taken the most conservative case out of them.

3.4. Physics Potential of LBNE in Conjunction with T2K, NOνA and ICAL 95

Thus, the exposure plotted here is for the most unfavourable values of true δCP

and θ23. Since hierarchy sensitivity of the Pµe channel increases with θ23, the

worst case is usually found at the lowest value considered which is θ23 = 39◦.
The most unfavourable of δCP is around +(−)90◦ for NH (IH) [154] (cf. Section
3.2.). Separate curves are shown for both hierarchies, but the results are almost

the same in both the cases. We ﬁnd that the adequate exposure for LBNE

including T2K, NOνA and ICAL data is around 22 MW-kt-yr for both NH and

IH. This is shown by the upper curves. The two intermediate curves show the

same sensitivity, but without including ICAL data in the analysis. In this case,

the adequate exposure is around 39 MW-kt-yr. Thus, in the absence of ICAL

data, LBNE would have to increase its exposure by over 75% to achieve the

same results. For the benchmark values of 1.2 MW power and 10 kt detector,

the exposure of 22 MW-kt-yr implies under 2 years of running in each mode

whereas the adequate exposure of 39 MW-kt-yr corresponds to about 3 years

exposure in neutrino and 3 years in antineutrino mode.

Finally, we show the sensitivity from LBNE alone, in the lowermost curves of

Fig. 3.20. For the range of exposures considered, LBNE can achieve hierarchy

sensitivity up to the χ2 = 16 level. The ﬁrst row of Table 3.4 shows the adequate

exposure required for hierarchy sensitivity reaching χ2 = 25 for only LBNE and

also after adding the data from T2K, NOνA and ICAL. The numbers in the

parentheses correspond to IH. With only LBNE, the exposure required to reach

χ2 = 25 for hierarchy sensitivity is seen to be much higher .

in the left/middle/right panel. The various curves show the eﬀect of including

a near detector on the sensitivity of LBNE alone and LBNE combined with the

other experiments.

3.4.2.2 Octant Sensitivity

The mass hierarchy as well as the values of δCP and θ23 in nature aﬀect the

octant sensitivity of experiments signiﬁcantly. In our analysis, we have considered

various true values of δCP across its full range, and two representative true values

of θ23 – 39◦ and 51◦. Having evaluated the minimum χ2 for each of these cases,

we have chosen the lower value to get a more conservative estimate. Thus, we

have ensured that the adequate exposure shown here holds, irrespective of the

true octant of θ23. Note that octant sensitivity reduces as we go more towards

θ23 = 45◦. Thus the above choice of true θ23 does not correspond to the most

conservative case.

The middle panel of Fig. 3.20 shows the combined octant sensitivity of the

experiments, as a function of LBNE exposure. Around 35 (37) MW-kt-yr for

NH (IH) is the required exposure for LBNE, to measure the octant with NOνA,

T2K and ICAL. This implies a runtime of around 3 years in each mode for the

‘standard’ conﬁguration of LBNE. Without information from ICAL however,

LBNE would have to increase its exposure to around 65 (50) MW-kt-yr for

NH (IH) to measure the octant with χ2 = 25. For a 1.2 MW beam and a 10

kt detector this implies about 5 (4) years for NH (IH) in each mode. While

only LBNE would need a higher exposure of 84 (76) MW-kt-yr for NH (IH)

corresponding to about 7 (6) years in each mode. Thus including ICAL data

reduces the exposure required from LBNE. This is summarized in the 2nd row

of Table 3.4.

3.4.2.3 Detecting CP Violation

Here, we have tried to determine the fraction of the entire δCP range for which

the setups can detect CP violation with at least χ2 = 9. We have always chosen

the smallest fraction over the true values of θ23 considered (39◦, 45◦ and 51◦), so

as to get a conservative estimate.

We ﬁnd in the right panel of Fig. 3.20 that for the range of exposures consid-

ered, the fraction of δCP is between 0.35 and 0.55. While the exposure increases

by a factor of two, the increase in the fraction of δCP is very slow. This combina-

tion of experiments can detect CP violation over 40% of the δCP range with an

exposure of about 65 MW-kt-yr at LBNE for NH (i.e. a runtime of around 5.5

years for LBNE). Without including T2K and NOνA information the exposure

required will be 114 MW-kt-yr for 40% coverage for discovery of δCP . In this

context, we want to remind that, one of the mandates of LBNE/DUNE is 3σ CP

coverage for 75% values of δCP [90]. We ﬁnd that an exposure of 300 MW-kt-yr

in neutrinos and 300 MW-kt-yr in antineutrinos gives 69% (73%) CP coverage at

3σ for θ23 = 39◦ and 60% (65%) for 51◦ in NH (IH). We also ﬁnd that addition

of NOνA and T2K data does not help much for such high values of exposure.

The results are summarized in Table 3.5.

98 Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

In the following subsections, we ﬁx the exposure in each case to be the ade-

quate exposure as listed in Table 3.4, for the most conservative parameter values.

3.4.3 Role of the Near Detector in Reducing Systematics

The role of the near detector (ND) in long-baseline neutrino experiments has

been well discussed in the literature, see for example Refs.

[194–196]. The

measurement of events at the near and far detector (FD) reduces the uncertainty

associated with the ﬂux and cross-section of neutrinos. Thus the role of the

near detector is to reduce systematic errors in an oscillation experiment. It has

recently been seen that the near detector for the T2K experiment can bring about

a spectacular reduction of systematic errors [197].

In this study, we have tried to quantify the improvement in results, once the

near detector is included. Instead of putting in reduced systematics by hand,

we have explicitly simulated the events at the near detector using GLoBES.

The design for the near detector is still being planned. For our simulations, we

assume that the near detector has a mass of 5 tons and is placed 459 meters

from the source. The ﬂux at the near detector site has been provided by the

LBNE collaboration [193]. The detector characteristics for the near detector are

as follows [198]. The muon (electron) detection eﬃciency is taken to be 95%

(50%). The NC background can be rejected with an eﬃciency of 20%. The

energy resolution for electrons is 6%/pE(GeV), while that for muons is 37 MeV

across the entire energy range of interest. Therefore, for the neutrinos, we use a

(somewhat conservative) energy resolution of 20%/pE(GeV). The systematic

errors that the near detector setup suﬀers from are assumed to be the same as

those of the far detector.

In order to have equal runtime for both FD and ND, we ﬁx the far detector

volume as 10 kt and consider both the detectors to receive neutrinos from 1.2 MW

beam. This ﬁxes the runtime of FD which is then also used in the simulation for

ND. The run times corresponding to the exposures which are taken in this section

are following: 1.8 year for hierarchy sensitivity, 3.1 year for octant sensitivity and

5.4 year for CPV discovery sensitivity.

3.4. Physics Potential of LBNE in Conjunction with T2K, NOνA and ICAL 99

In order to simulate the ND+FD setup for LBNE, we use GLoBES to gen-

erate events at both detectors, treating them as separate experiments. We then

use these two data sets to perform a correlated systematics analysis using the

method of pulls [177]. This gives us the combined sensitivity of LBNE using both

near and far detectors. Thereafter, the procedure of combining results with other

experiments and marginalising over oscillation parameters continues in the usual

manner. The results are shown in Fig. 3.21. The eﬀect of reduced systematic

errors is felt most signiﬁcantly in regions where the results are best. This is be-

cause for those values of δCP , the experiment typically has high enough statistics

for systematic errors to play an important role.

Next, we have tried to quantify the reduction in systematic errors seen by

the experiment, when the near detector is included. To be more speciﬁc, if the

systematic errors seen by the far detector setup are denoted by ~π, then what is

the eﬀective set of errors ~πeﬀ for the far detector setup, once the near detector is

also included. In other words, for given systematic errors ~π, we have found the

value of ~πeﬀ that satisﬁes the relation

χ2(FD(~πeﬀ)) ≡ χ2(FD(~π) + ND(~π)) ,

(3.8)

where the right-hand side denotes the correlated combination. The result of the

computation is shown in Fig. 3.22, for the case of hierarchy determination. We

have chosen typical values of systematic errors for the detector: νe appearance

signal norm error of 2.5%, νµ disappearance signal norm error of 7.5%, νe ap-

pearance background norm error of 10% and νµ disappearance background norm

error of 15%. The tilt error is taken as 2.5% in both appearance and disappear-

have not varied the tilt errors in this particular analysis because their eﬀect on

overall results is quite small. The sensitivity of FD+ND obtained using these

numbers, are matched by an FD setup with eﬀective errors as follows: νe ap-

νe appearance background norm error of 5% and νµ disappearance background

norm error of 5%. Similar results are obtained in the case of octant and CP

The second oscillation maximum, for which the oscillating term takes the value

3π/2, occurs at an energy of around 0.6-1.0 GeV. Studies have discussed the

advantages of using the second oscillation maximum to get information on the

oscillation parameters [199, 200]. In fact, one of the main aims of the proposed

ESSnuSB project [94, 201] is to study neutrino oscillations at the second oscilla-

tion maximum.

The neutrino ﬂux that LBNE will use has a wide-band proﬁle, which can

extract physics from both, the ﬁrst and second maxima. Fig. 3.23 shows Pµe for

the LBNE baseline, superimposed on the νµ ﬂux. This is in contrast with NOνA,

which uses a narrow-band oﬀ-axis beam concentrating on its ﬁrst oscillation

maximum, in order to reduce the π0 background at higher energies.

In order to understand the impact of the second oscillation maximum, we

have considered two diﬀerent energy ranges. Above 1.1 GeV, only the ﬁrst os-

cillation cycle is relevant. However, if we also include the energy range from 0.5

to 1.1 GeV, we get information from the second oscillation maximum. Fig. 3.24

compares the sensitivity to the hierarchy, octant and CP violation only from the

ﬁrst oscillation cycle and from both the oscillation cycles assuming the adequate

exposures obtained previously. We see that inclusion of data from the second

oscillation maximum only increases the χ2 by a small amount. This increase is

visible only for hierarchy sensitivity. As expected, the eﬀect is pronounced in the
region δCP = −90◦. The results for all three performance indicators are given in
Table 3.7. It is seen that the eﬀect of including the second oscillation maxima

is more for only LBNE for which a higher exposure is needed and this eﬀect is

signiﬁcant for hierarchy sensitivity.

3.4.5 Optimising the Neutrino-Antineutrino Runs

One of the main questions while planning any beam-based neutrino experiment is

the ratio of neutrino to antineutrino run. Since the the neutrino and antineutrino
probabilities are diﬀerent due to δCP → −δCP , an antineutrino run can provide
a diﬀerent set of data which may be useful in determination of the parameters.

Table 3.7: Eﬀect of the second oscillation maximum on the sensitivity of LBNE.

The numbers indicate the adequate exposure (in MW-kt-yr) required by LBNE

for determining the oscillation parameters, with and without the contribution

from the second oscillation maximum. For each of the three unknowns, the true

parameters (including hierarchy) are taken to be ones for which we get the most

conservative sensitivity.

However, the interaction cross-section for antineutrinos in the detectors is smaller

by a factor of 2.5-3 than the neutrino cross-sections. Therefore, an antineutrino

run typically has lower statistics. Thus, the choice of neutrino-antineutrino ratio

is often a compromise between new information and lower statistics.

It is well known that neutrino and antineutrino oscillation probabilities suﬀer

from the same form of hierarchy-δCP degeneracy [154]. However, the octant-δCP

degeneracy has the opposite form for neutrinos and antineutrinos [147]. Thus,

inclusion of an antineutrino run helps in lifting this degeneracy for most of the

values of δCP [191]. For measurement of δCP , it has been shown, for T2K,

that the antineutrino run is required only for those true hierarchy-octant-δCP

combination for which octant degeneracy is present [202]. Once this degeneracy

is lifted by including some amount of antineutrino data, further antineutrino

run does not help much in CP discovery; in fact it is then better to run with

neutrinos to gain in statistics [202]. But this conclusion may change for a diﬀerent

baseline and matter eﬀect. From Fig. 3.23 we see that for NOνA the oscillation

peak does not coincide with the ﬂux peak. Around the energy where the ﬂux
peaks, the probability spectra with δCP = ±0, 180◦ are not equidistant from the

104Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

δCP = ±90◦ spectra. For antineutrino mode the curves for ±90◦ switch position.
Hence for neutrinos δCP = 0◦ is closer to δCP = −90◦ and δCP = 180◦ is closer to
δCP = 90◦, while the opposite is true for antineutrinos. This gives a synergy and

hence running in both neutrino an antineutrino modes can be helpful. For T2K

the energy where the ﬂux peak occurs coincides with the oscillation peak. At this
point the curves for δCP = 0, 180◦ are equidistant from δCP = ±90◦ and hence
this synergy is not present. Thus, the role of antineutrino run is only to lift the

octant degeneracy. In what follows we have varied the proportion of neutrino and

antineutrino runs to ascertain what is the optimal combination. The adequate

exposure is split into various combinations of neutrinos and antineutrinos – 1/6 ν

+ 5/6 ν, 2/6 ν + 4/6 ν, ... 6/6 ν + 0/6 ν. The intermediate conﬁguration 3/6 ν

+ 3/6 ν corresponds to the equal-run conﬁguration used in the other sections.

For convenience of notation, these conﬁgurations are referred to simply as 1+5,

etc., i.e. without appending the ‘/6’. The results are shown in Fig. 3.25.

The top row of Fig. 3.25 shows the hierarchy sensitivity of LBNE for various

combinations of neutrino and antineutrino run. Normal hierarchy and θ23 = 39◦

have been assumed as the true parameters. For LBNE, we have chosen an ex-

posure of 22 MW-kt-yr which was found to be the adequate exposure assuming

equal neutrino and antineutrino runs. In the left panel, we see the results for
LBNE alone. the ﬁgure shows that in the favourable region of δCP ∈ [−180◦, 0]
the best sensitivity comes from the combination 3+3 or 4+2. Although the

statistics is more for neutrinos, the antineutrino run is required to remove the
wrong-octant regions. For normal hierarchy, δCP ∈ [0, 180◦] is the unfavourable
region for hierarchy determination [154], as is evident from the ﬁgure. In this

region, we see that the results are worst for pure neutrino run. The best sensi-

tivity comes for the case 5+1. This amount of antineutrino run is required to

remove the octant degeneracy. The higher proportion of neutrino run ensures

better statistics. In the right panel, along with LBNE we have also combined

data from NOνA, T2K and ICAL. With the inclusion of these data the hierarchy

sensitivity increases further and even in the unfavourable region χ2 = 25 sen-

sitivity is possible with only neutrino run from LBNE. This is because NOνA,

Figure 3.25: Sensitivity of LBNE for various combinations of neutrino and an-

tineutrino run by itself (left panel) and in conjunction with T2K, NOνA and

ICAL (right panel). The top/middle/bottom row shows the sensitivity to hier-

archy/octant/CP violation detection. The total exposure has been divided into

6 equal parts and distributed between neutrinos and antineutrinos. For example,

for hierarchy sensitivity, 6+0 corresponds to 44 MW-kt-yr in only neutrino; 3+3

correspond to 22 MW-kt-yr in both neutrino and antineutrino mode.

106Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

which will run in antineutrino mode for 3 years and the antineutrino component

in the atmospheric neutrino ﬂux at ICAL, will provide the necessary amount of

information to lift the parameter degeneracies that reduce hierarchy sensitivity.

Therefore, the best option for LBNE is to run only in neutrino mode, which will

have the added advantage of increased statistics. In the favourable region also

the sensitivity is now better for 6+0 and 5+1 i.e.

less amount of antineutrinos

from LBNE is required because of the antineutrino information coming from

NOνA. Note that overall, the amount of antineutrino run depends on the value

of δCP . However combining information from all the experiments 4+2 seems to

be the best option over the largest fraction of δCP values.

In the middle row of Fig. 3.25, we have shown the octant sensitivity of LBNE

alone (left panel) and in combination with the current experiments (right panel).

For LBNE we have used an exposure of 37 MW-kt-yr. We have ﬁxed the true

hierarchy to be inverted, and θ23 = 39◦ i.e in the lower octant. For this case
the probability for neutrinos is maximum for δCP ∼ −90◦ and overlaps with the
higher octant probabilities. Thus the octant sensitivity in neutrino channel is

very poor. Thus the worst results for these values of δCP come from only neu-

trino runs. For antineutrino channel because of the ﬂip in δCP the probability for
δCP = −90◦ is well separated from those for HO. Therefore the octant sensitivity
comes mainly from antineutrino channel [147]. Thus, addition of antineutrino
runs help in enhancing octant sensitivity. Therefore at −90◦ the best sensitivity
is from 1+5 i.e 1/6th neutrino + 5/6th antineutrino combination. On the other

hand the neutrino probability is minimum for δCP = +90◦ and LO and there-

fore there is octant sensitivity in the neutrino channel. However since we are

considering IH the antineutrino probabilities are enhanced due to matter eﬀect

and for a broadband beam some sensitivity comes from the antineutrino channel

also. Therefore there is slight increase in octant sensitivity by adding antineu-

trino data as can be seen. Overall, the best compromise is seen to be reached

for 2+4 i.e 1/3rd neutrino and 2/3rd antineutrino combination, which gives the

best results over the widest range of δCP values. Addition of NOνA, T2K and

ICAL data increases the octant sensitivity. The octant sensitivity is best for

3.5. Constraining δCP using First Three Years of IceCube Data

107

combinations having more antineutrinos. For δCP ∼ +90◦ all combinations give
almost the same sensitivity.

The left and right panels of the bottom row in Fig. 3.25 show the ability of

LBNE (by itself, and in conjunction with the current generation of experiment,

respectively) to detect CP violation. Here the true hierarchy is NH and true

θ23 is 51◦. Although this true combination does not suﬀer from any octant

degeneracy, we see in the left panel that 6+0 is not the best combination. This

is due to the synergy between neutrino-antineutrino runs for larger baselines as

discussed earlier. In both cases, we ﬁnd that the best option is to run LBNE with

antineutrinos for around a third of the total exposure. On adding information

from the other experiments, we ﬁnd great improvement in the CP sensitivity.

From the right panel, we see that the range of δCP for which χ2 = 9 detection

of CP is possible is almost the same for most combinations of neutrino and

antineutrino run. Therefore, as in the case of octant determination, the exact

choice of combination is not very important.

3.5 Constraining δCP using First Three Years of

IceCube Data

In this section, we will try to ﬁnd constraint on δCP by analysing data from

ultra high energy neutrinos (UHE) coming from various astrophysical sources.

The study of cosmic particles, and through them the study of astrophysical

phenomena has gradually moved up the energy scale over the last few decades.

The ﬁrst data set announced by the IceCube collaboration consists of 28 events

above 25 TeV, detected over a period of 662 days of live time (May 2011 – May

2012 with 79 strings, and May 2012 – May 2013 with 86 strings). 7 out of these

28 events are tracks signifying (νµ + ¯νµ) charged-current (CC) events; while the

other 21 are showers indicating either (νe + ¯νe) or (ντ + ¯ντ ), or (νµ + ¯νµ) neutral-

current (NC) events [203]. This 4σ detection marked the ﬁrst discovery of UHE

neutrinos. Further data was collected for next one year. For the full 988 days

IceCube collected 37 events, adding 1 track, 7 shower events and 1 was produced

108Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

by a coincident pair of background muons from unrelated air showers that cannot

be reconstructed with a single direction and energy.

In this section, we will analyse the IceCube neutrino data to measure δCP

and determine the source of astrophysical neutrinos. In Ref.

[204], the author

discussed in detail the complementary nature of astrophysical and terrestrial

neutrino experiments in studies regarding the detections of δCP . In this paper

(and more recently in Ref. [205]), data in the form of ﬂavour ratios of observed

neutrinos was used. In this study, we have analysed data from IceCube using a

similar approach to get a hint about the value of δCP .

3.5.1 Astrophysical Sources

The data recorded by the IceCube telescope is the ﬁrst evidence of extra-terrestrial

events in the UHE range. These neutrinos can have their origin in extra-

galactic astrophysical sources like low power Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) jets

in stars [206] or Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) cores [207]. The energy of
the 37 detected neutrino events are in the range 25 − 2000 TeV. By tracing
the hadronic origin [208] of these events, one can estimate the proton ener-
gies at their sources to be within 0.5 − 40 PeV. Supernova Remnants (SNRs),
AGNs, GRBs and other astrophysical sources can accelerate protons to very

high energies. The interactions of these protons with soft photons or mat-

ter from the source can give UHE neutrinos through the following process:
pγ, pp → π±X, π± → µ±νµ(¯νµ), µ± → e± ¯νµ(νµ)νe(¯νe) [209, 210] with a ﬂux
ratio of φνe : φνµ : φντ = 1 : 2 : 0 (known as πS process). Some of the muons,

due to their light mass, can get cooled in the magnetic ﬁeld quickly resulting in

a neutrino ﬂux ratio of 0 : 1 : 0 (µDS process). K-mesons, produced from pγ

interactions with a cross-section two orders of magnitude less than pions, will

cool in the magnetic ﬁeld of the source at higher energies compared to the pions.
K + → µ+ ¯νµ is the dominant channel of neutrino production from cooled pions,
with a branching fraction of 63%, and with the same ﬂux ratio as the pion de-

cay [211]. The pγ interaction also produces high energy neutrons which would
decay as n → p + e− + ν e to antineutrinos [212] with the ﬂux ratio of 1 : 0 : 0

3.5. Constraining δCP using First Three Years of IceCube Data

109

(nS process). The relative contribution of each channel depends on diﬀerent pa-

rameters of the astrophysical source like the magnetic ﬁeld, the strength of the

shock wave and density of photon background [213]. Apart from the neutrinos

these processes also produce high energy photons inside the source. Correlation

of high energy photons with the UHE neutrinos can be considered as a signature

of hadron production inside the source. For example, a TeV neutrino can have

an accompanying TeV photon at the source. However due to attenuation in the

background radiation during propagation, PeV photons will have typical mean
free path ∼ 10 kpc [214]. Thus, the associated photons of TeV neutrinos from
extragalactic sources cannot reach earth.

3.5.2 Analysis

The main sources of astrophysical neutrinos are the πS, µDS and nS channels.

However, the exact fraction of events in the detector from each of these sources

is not known. Therefore, we have introduced relative fractions k1, k2 and k3

for these three sources respectively, which are treated as free parameters in the

problem subject to the normalisation constraint P ki = 1. In this study, we have

not considered any other sub-dominant mode of neutrino production.

Neutrinos oscillate during propagation and given that the value of L/E for

such neutrinos is very large, we can only observe the average oscillation proba-

bility. Therefore, the probabilities take the simple form:

P (να → νβ) ≡ Pαβ = Xi

|Uαi|2|Uβi|2 .

(3.9)

It is worth emphasizing that this oscillation probability depends only on the

mixing angles and CP phase, but not on the mass-squared diﬀerences. Therefore,

unlike in beam-based experiments where knowledge of the mass hierarchy is

crucial for CP sensitivity [154], in this case we can (at least in principle) detect

CP violation without suﬀering from the hierarchy degeneracy. Also note that

Pαβ = Pβα, therefore the probability can only be an even function of δCP . As

a consequence, we can treat neutrino and antineutrino oscillations on an equal

footing. Another consequence of this is that every value of δCP allowed by the

110Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

data will be accompanied by a degenerate solution (−δCP ).

The distinction between tracks (which we assume to be νµ CC events) and

showers (which we assume to be νe or ντ or νµ NC events) is quite clear in the

IceCube detector. We have folded the relative initial ﬂuxes with the oscillation

probabilities to get the relative number of events at the detector. Separation of

muon events into CC and NC has been done using the ratio of the cross-sections

at the relevant energy [215]. We have done a simple analysis using the total

events, instead of binning the data in energy and angle. Since the probability

is almost independent of energy, this simpliﬁcation is not expected to aﬀect the

analysis. This also allows us to neglect the eﬀect of energy resolution. In Ref.

be 10.6+5.0

[75], the number of background events in the IceCube data set is estimated to
−3.6. Of these, 6.0 ± 3.4 are expected to be veto penetrating atmospheric
−1.2 are from the atmospheric neutrino background above energy

muons and 4.6+3.7

10 TeV. The background assumed by IceCube could be an overestimation [216],

since (a) it has been estimated by extrapolating data, and (b) for atmospheric

neutrinos the background has been calculated from 10 TeV while the events

have been detected with lowest energy nearly 28 TeV. Therefore, we have used

an estimate of 3 background atmospheric muon tracks and 3.4 (the lower limit)
background atmospheric neutrinos. IceCube have predicted a total of 8.4 ± 4.2
muon events and 6.6+5.9
−1.6 atmospheric neutrinos [167] including the next set of

neutrino events detected for the period of 988 days. Using the same analysis

method we have taken the lowest limit of the backgrounds for our calculation.

We have separated the background atmospheric neutrinos into tracks and showers

using the same cross-sections as mentioned earlier. These background events are

subtracted from the data set in our analysis.

In Refs. [204, 205, 217, 218], the authors have proposed the use of the variable

R = Nµ/(Ne + Nτ ) for the study of CP violation with astrophysical sources,

where Nα is the ﬂux of να + ¯να at the detector. This variable helps by eliminating

the overall source and detector-dependent normalisation. Moreover, as studies of

the up/down ratio as well as data/MC ratio in atmospheric neutrinos have shown,

taking ratios of event rates can also reduce the eﬀect of systematics [219, 220].

3.5. Constraining δCP using First Three Years of IceCube Data

111

For our study, we have constructed a similar quantity ρ = Ntrack/Nshower, with

the ﬂavour compositions of the track and shower events as mentioned before.

We have constructed the quantity ρdata using the IceCube data, and calcu-

lated ρtheory for a certain value of δCP as described above. Background events

are subtracted from the data, as mentioned above. The statistical χ2 is then

computed using the Gaussian deﬁnition

χ2(δCP ) = (cid:18)ρdata − ρtheory

σρ

(cid:19)2

,

(3.10)

where σρ is the corresponding error . We have incorporated systematic eﬀects

using the method of pulls, with a systematic error of 5%. Note that, we have

marginalised the ∆χ2 over the mixing angles (θ23, θ13, θ12) within the ranges θ23
= 35◦ to 55◦, sin2 2θ13= 0.085 to 0.115 and θ12= 30◦ to 36◦ respectively. Here
we take priors on all the three mixing angles. The priors added are σ(sin2 2θ13)
= 0.01, σ(sin2 2θ23) = 0.1 and σ(sin2 θ12) = 0.0155.

3.5.3 Results

To demonstrate the impact of the origin of these astrophysical neutrinos on the

precision of δCP , we start with various possibilities,

like, single, double or a

combination of three sources as the origin. First we show the ﬁt to the data as

shows the results of our analysis of the full three-year data set. We have also

included the results from analysing data from only the ﬁrst two years (lower row)

to show the improvement in results from additional data.

In the left panels we assume that all the events seen at IceCube are purely

of astrophysical origin whereas in the right panels we include the eﬀect of back-

grounds. The latter is the realistic assumption. From these ﬁgures we can see

that, in case of no background the πS source is favoured by the data as compared

to the nS and µDS source (though the sensitivity is quite small, as ∆χ2 is always

< 1.5). However, when we include the background, the scenario changes com-

pletely. Pure πS and pure µDS sources are ruled out by the data at > 3σ, while

the pure nS source is favoured by data, though it is not suﬃcient to put any sig-

Ref. [216]. This result can be understood qualitatively in the following way. In

the 2nd column of Table 3.8 we have listed the theoretically calculated values for

whereas the third column contains the experimental values of the track by shower

ratio without and with backgrounds. We can clearly see that for a pure signal,

the track to shower ratio for πS is closest to the data. But the diﬀerence becomes

quite high when backgrounds are taken under consideration, resulting in a very

high ∆χ2. A comparison of the upper and lower panels shows a marked increase

in ∆χ2. This shows the importance of additional data in both, excluding certain

combinations of sources as well as constraining the value of δCP .

We have also done an analysis of the events in the energy range 60 TeV < E <

3 PeV considering the 3 years of IceCube data. This is motivated by the fact

that, this energy interval contains the atmospheric muon background less than

one. In this energy range there are 4 track events and 16 shower events with an

atmospheric muon background of 0.435 and atmospheric neutrino background

of 2.365 [167]. The result is plotted in Fig. 3.27.

10Due to the present non-zero value of θ13, there will be deviations from the TBM values

but as shown in Ref. [205], this deviation is quite small.

114Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

the right panel we can see that we are still getting nS as the favoured source

whereas πS and µDS sources are excluded at more than 2σ. This is due to

the fact that though the atmospheric muon background is less than one in this

energy range but due to the presence of atmospheric neutrino background nS is

getting preferred over πS source. This can bee seen from the left panel where no

background is considered. There we can note that the data agrees with the ﬁnal

ﬂavor ratio 1:1:1; i.e., it favours the πS source over nS source marginally when

TBM mixing is assumed. But when we vary the oscillation parameters in their

allowed 3σ range then due to the deviation from TBM, nS is getting slightly

preferred over πS.

In Fig. 3.28 and Fig. 3.29 we show the ﬁt to the data when neutrinos are

coming from two/all the three sources respectively, with equal contributions.

These results are for the full data set, and backgrounds have been included in

generating these plots. In Fig. 3.28, we ﬁnd only the combination of πS and

nS neutrinos are allowed at 3σ level. We also see that the CP dependence is

maximum if the neutrinos come from the combination of πS and µDS modes.
The data may also rule out one-third of δCP values (approximately −60◦ to 60◦) at
∼ 2σ. The poor sensitivity from nS neutrinos is the reason why the combination

of πS+µDS in Fig. 3.28 has a higher χ2 than the combinations involving nS.

When we consider equal contributions from all these channels (Fig. 3.29), we

ﬁnd that the data favours the ﬁrst and fourth quadrants of δCP at 1σ.

We have then performed a check to constrain the astrophysical parameters ki
vs δCP using the IceCube data, by plotting the allowed contours in the ki − δCP
plane. In Fig. 3.30, we have showed the 2σ (light) and 3σ (dark) contours in the
k1 − δCP plane for three ﬁxed values of k2. The best-ﬁt point indicated by the
data has been marked with a red dot. We see that the data favours a smaller

value of k1 and larger values of k2 and k3. Similarly, Fig. 3.31 shows that for

a given value of k1, the data disfavours the µDS process (small value of k2) but

favours the nS process (large value of k3). Likewise, Fig. 3.32 shows the data

favouring the largest possible value of k3 allowed by the normalisation condition.

These features can be understood from Fig. 3.26, where we see that the data

prefers the nS source. From these contours, we may draw certain constraints on

the astrophysical sources most favoured. In particular if we obtain a good prior

on δCP from other experiments, then the most favoured ratio of k1, k2 and k3

may be obtained. Alternately, if we obtain a better picture of the sources of the

IceCube events, a reﬁned and constrained range on δCP would be predicted.

qualitatively from the πS curve of Fig. 3.26 showing a signiﬁcant improvement

3.6 Summary

In this chapter we have studied the capabilities of the current/future generation

neutrino experiments to constrain the remaining unknowns of neutrino oscillation

118Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

parameters.

In Section 3.2, we have studied the CP sensitivity of the T2K,

NOνA and ICAL@INO experiments. We emphasized the critical impact that

atmospheric neutrinos can have in obtaining the ﬁrst hint of CPV from the

LBL experiments T2K/NOνA. This is achieved by the ability of the atmospheric

neutrino data to exclude the degenerate solutions. Taking the projected run times

of T2K and NOνA, we show that adding ICAL data can provide a signature of
CPV at 2σ conﬁdence level for ∼ 58% δCP values. We also analyse the synergies
between these setups which may aid in CP violation discovery and a precision

measurement of δCP . This has been studied for diﬀerent combinations of these

experiments. We ﬁnd that, while the CP sensitivity principally arises from the

appearance channel of NOνA/T2K, the appearance and disappearance channels

are synergistic due to their diﬀerent dependences on δCP . Pµe depends on δCP

through the quantity cos(∆ + δCP ), while Pµµ only has a cos δCP dependence.

Thus their combination gives a CP sensitivity signiﬁcantly higher than the sum

of sensitivities of the two channels. We also note that for smaller values of θ13,
the CP-discovery χ2 ∝ θ13 and hence increases with θ13. On the other hand, for
larger values of θ13 the CP-discovery χ2 ∝ (90◦ − θ13)2 which decreases with θ13.
The discovery χ2 attains its highest value in the range sin2 2θ13 ∼ 0.08 − 0.2.
This tells us that the range of θ13 provided by nature lies in an optimal region

which is favourable for CP sensitivity with such experiments.

In Section 3.3 we have studied the physics potential of the LBNO setup to de-

termine neutrino mass hierarchy, octant of θ23 and CP violation in leptonic sector

in conjunction with T2K, NOνA and ICAL. We have explored the minimum ex-

posure needed for such a set-up and quantiﬁed the ‘adequate’ conﬁguration that

can exclude the wrong hierarchy (χ2 = 25), exclude the wrong octant (χ2 = 25)

and detect CP violation (χ2 = 9). We have determined the adequate exposure

required for LBNO in units of POT-kt and for the least favourable true hierarchy,

θ23 and δCP . In determining the requisite exposure we fully exploit the possible

synergies between the existing LBL experiment T2K and NOνA and the atmo-

spheric neutrino experiment ICAL@INO which is likely to commence data taking

in ﬁve years time. For the prospective LBNO conﬁguration we consider three

options: CERN-Pyh¨asalmi (2290 km) baseline with a LArTPC, CERN-Slanic
(1500 km) with a LArTPC and CERN-Fr´ejus (130 km) with a Water ˇCerenkov

detector. The ‘adequate’ exposure needed is summarized in Table 3.3 where we

give the results for T2K+NOνA+LBNO with and without ICAL. Inclusion of

the atmospheric data from ICAL can play a signiﬁcant role in reducing the expo-

sure required for hierarchy and octant determination for the 2290 and 1540 km

setups and for octant and CP detection for the 130 km set-up. Of the two longer

baselines, we ﬁnd that 2290 km is best suited to determine the mass hierarchy,

while 1540 km is better for detecting CP violation. However, 130 km is the best

candidate for CP violation physics.

In Section 3.4, we have carried out a similar analysis for the LBNE experi-

ment. We have evaluated the adequate exposure for LBNE (in units of MW-kt-

yr), i.e., the minimum exposure for LBNE to determine the unknown parameters

in combination with T2K, NOνA and ICAL, for all values of the oscillation pa-

rameters. The threshold for determination is taken to be χ2 = 25 for the mass

hierarchy and octant, and χ2 = 9 for detecting CP violation. The results are

summarized in Table 3.4. We ﬁnd that adding information from NOνA and

T2K helps in reducing the exposure required by only LBNE for determination of

all the three unknowns– hierarchy, octant and δCP . Adding ICAL data to this

combination further help in achieving the same level of sensitivity with a reduc-

tion in exposure of LBNE (apart from δCP ). Thus the synergy between various

experiments can be helpful in economising the LBNE conﬁguration. We have

also probed the role of the near detector in improving the results by reducing

systematic errors. We have simulated events at the near and far detectors and

performed a correlated systematics analysis of both sets of events. We ﬁnd an

improvement in the physics reach of LBNE when the near detector is included.

We have also evaluated the drop in systematics because of the near detector.

Our results are shown in Table 3.6.

Further we have checked the role of information from the lowest energy bins

which are aﬀected by the second oscillation maximum of the probability. We

ﬁnd that for the combined study of LBNE and the other experiments, the second

120Chapter 3. Probing Neutrino Oscillation Parameters in Future Experiments

oscillation maxima do not play much role for the adequate exposure. However

for only LBNE, with a higher adequate exposure, the second maxima has a

signiﬁcant role in the hierarchy sensitivity.

Finally, we have done an optimisation study of the neutrino-antineutrino

run for LBNE. The amount of antineutrino run required depends on the true

value of δCP .

It helps in achieving two objectives – (i) reduction in octant

degeneracy and (ii) synergy between neutrino and antineutrino data for octant

and CP sensitivity. For hierarchy determination using a total exposure of 44

MW-kt-yr the optimal combination for only LBNE is (3+3) which corresponds

to 22 MW-kt-yr in neutrino and antineutrino mode each, for δCP in the lower
half-plane [−180◦, 0] and true NH-LO. For δCP in the upper half-plane ([0, 180◦])
the optimal ratio is 5/6th of the total exposure in neutrinos and + 1/6th of

the total exposure in antineutrinos. Adding information from T2K, NOνA and

ICAL the best combination for LBNE is 2/3rd neutrino + 1/3rd antineutrino for

δCP in the lower half-plane.

In the upper half-plane, pure neutrino run gives

the best sensitivity. In the latter case, the antineutrino component coming from

NOνA and ICAL helps in reducing the required antineutrino run from LBNE. For

octant sensitivity the best result from the combined experiments comes from the

proportion (1/6th + 5/6th) except for δCP = +90◦ where all combinations give

almost the same sensitivity. For CPV discovery, all combinations give similar

results when the data are added together, with equal neutrino and antineutrino

or 2/3rd neutrino + 1/3rd antineutrino combination faring slightly better.

Finally in Section 3.5 we have explored the possibility to constrain the leptonic

phase δCP from the IceCube data. we have analysed the ﬁrst IceCube data on

TeV-PeV scale neutrinos. We have used the ﬂux ratios of the three neutrino

ﬂavours to put constraints on δCP . We ﬁnd that the results depend strongly on

the source of the neutrinos. After taking into account the eﬀect of backgrounds,

we ﬁnd that the nS source of neutrinos is favoured by the data. Depending

on the particular combination of sources for these neutrinos, current data can

only hint at the allowed region of the δCP range. However, we have shown that

additional data gives a remarkable improvement in results, which underlines the

3.6. Summary

121

importance of future data from IceCube. We have also put constraints on the

astrophysical parameters k1, k2 and k3 that determine which of the modes of

neutrino production is more close to the data.

Chapter 4

Neutrino Mass Matrices

4.1 Overview

In this chapter we discuss the structure of the low energy neutrino mass matrix in

the presence of one extra light sterile neutrino. As mentioned in the introduction,

the neutrino mass matrix in ﬂavour basis is not diagonal and can be written as

Mν = V ∗M diag

ν V †

(4.1)

where V is the leptonic mixing matrix which contains the neutrino oscillation

parameters, in a basis where charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal and M diag

ν

is

the diagonal mass matrix. From the above equation it is clear that the neutrino

oscillation parameters can determine the elements of the low energy neutrino

mass matrix Mν. One of the popular themes to study the structure of the low

energy mass matrix is in terms of texture zeros1. Texture zero means one or more

elements of the mass matrix are relatively small compared to the others. Such

studies help in understanding the underlying parameter space and the nature

of the mass spectrum involved and often predict correlations between various

parameters which can be experimentally tested. At the fundamental level the

structure of the mass matrix is determined by the Yukawa couplings which are

essentially free parameters in most models. Knowing the form of the low energy

neutrino mass matrix may help to constrain the high scale structures includ-

Chapter 4. Neutrino Mass Matrices

ing zero textures in the Yukawa matrix itself [221–224]. The origin of texture

zero could be due to U(1) symmetry like Froggatt-Neilsen [225] or other ﬂavour

symmetries [226], discreet or continuous. Texture zeros in the low energy mass

matrices in the context of three generations have been extensively explored both

in the quark and lepton sector [227–239]. In particular for three generations of

neutrinos, a very remarkable result was obtained in [228] that there can be at

the most two zeros in the low energy neutrino mass matrix in the ﬂavour basis.

As mentioned in the Introduction, data from LSND and MiniBooNE exper-

iments can not be accommodated in the three neutrino scenario. These exper-

iments have reported oscillations which can only be explained by the inclusion

of one or more sterile neutrino having mass in the eV scale. The recently ob-

served Gallium and reactor anomaly also provide additional support to the sterile

neutrino hypothesis.

These evidences of sterile neutrino motivated us to study the texture zero

properties of the neutrino mass matrix in the presence of the light sterile neutri-

nos and compare the results with that of three generation case. In our study we

considered the one-zero and two-zero textures in 3+1 scenario. We ﬁnd that the

allowed textures and correlations between diﬀerent parameters diﬀer signiﬁcantly

as compared to the results of the three generation case 2.

This chapter is organised in the following way. In Section 4.2 we will ﬁrst

review and update the texture zero results of the 3 generation case and in section

4.3 we will describe the mass and mixing pattern in the 3+1 scheme. In Section

4.4 and 4.5 we present the results for two-zero and one-zero textures of Mν in

3+1 scenario. We summarize our results in Section 4.6.

2Unlike three generation case, in the context of the 4-neutrinos, more than two zeros can

be allowed. The results for three texture zero in 3+1 scheme can be found in [240].

4.2 Texture Zero Results for 3 Generation

In three generation picture, the low energy Majorana neutrino mass matrix Mν
is a 3 × 3 complex symmetric matrix having six independent elements given by

(4.2)

Thus for three generations there are 15 possible two-zero textures and 6 possible

one-zero textures. The two-zero textures are categorised in diﬀerent classes as

shown in Table 4.1. The ﬁrst analysis of the two-zero textures in the three

generation has been done in [228] and shown that among the 15 possible textures,

only 7 textures are phenomenologically allowed. A detailed analysis regarding the

parameter space of the allowed textures were presented in [229, 230]. At that

time θ13 was unknown and those analysis were performed taking the CHOOZ

upper bound of θ13. After the precise measurement of θ13, the same analysis

has been done by many groups in view of the current data [236, 239, 241]. The

main conclusion of the all the analysis are almost same but with the precise

measurements of the oscillation parameters the allowed parameter space of the

viable textures have been reduced signiﬁcantly. Below we brieﬂy discuss the

main results of the two-zero textures3. Textures belonging to A class are allowed

in only normal hierarchy. The textures in B class are allowed in both normal

and inverted hierarchy. The classes B1 and B4 predict negative values of cos δCP

whereas the classes B2 and B3 predict positive values of cos δCP . The textures

belonging to the B class can also predict the octant of θ23. The textures B1 and

B3 predict θ23 in the lower octant and the textures B2 and B4 predict θ23 in the

upper octant for normal hierarchy. The predictions are opposite for the inverted

hierarchy. The texture belonging to C class is allowed mainly in the inverted

hierarchy. This class is marginally allowed in the normal hierarchy when θ23

is close to 45◦. For the viability of this class, when θ23 < 45◦, one must have

3We have also done the analysis regarding the two-zero textures in three generation case.

We will discuss our results in Section 4.4.2.1.

−90◦ < δCP < 90◦ and when θ23 > 45◦, one must have 90◦ < δCP < 270◦. The
textures in the classes D, E and F are forbidden by the data.

Analysis of the one-zero textures in 3 generations has been done in Ref. [242,

243]. Regarding the matrix element mee which is the eﬀective mass governing

the neutrinoless double beta decay, it is well known that it can vanish only for

normal hierarchy. The element meµ can be zero in both normal hierarchy and

inverted hierarchy. For the case of inverted hierarchy this predicts sin α = 0

where α being the Majorana phase. The predictions for meτ = 0 is similar as

that of meµ. The elements mµµ and mτ τ can vanish in both the hierarchies. For
quasi-degenerate masses i.e., m1 ≈ m2 ≈ m3, θ23 needs to be below 45◦ if mµµ is
zero and above 45◦ if mτ τ is zero. They also predict sin α = 0. The element mµτ

can only vanish for quasi-degenerate masses and predict4 sin α = 0.

4.3 Masses and Mixing in the 3+1 Scheme

Addition of one extra sterile neutrino to the standard three generation picture

gives rise to two possible mass patterns – the 2+2 and 3+1 scenarios [244–246].

Of these, the 2+2 schemes are strongly disfavored by the solar and atmospheric

neutrino oscillation data [247]. The 3+1 picture also suﬀers from some tension

between observation of oscillations in antineutrino channel by LSND and Mini-

BooNE and non-observation of oscillations in the neutrino channels as well as

in disappearance measurements. However, it was shown recently in [248] that a

reasonable goodness-of-ﬁt can still be obtained. Although introduction of more

than one sterile neutrinos may provide a better ﬁt to the neutrino oscillation

data [249, 250], the 3+1 scheme is considered to be minimal and to be more

consistent with the cosmological data [251]. Very recently combined analysis of

cosmological and short baseline (SBL) data in the context of additional sterile

neutrinos have been performed in [252, 253]. The analysis in [253] found a pref-

erence of the 3+1 scenario over 3+2 while the analysis in [252] shows that the

the one-zero textures in three generation in view of the current experimental data.

128

Chapter 4. Neutrino Mass Matrices

status of the 3+2 scenario depends on the cosmological data set used and the

ﬁtting procedure and no conclusive statement can be made regarding whether it

is favored or disallowed.

Theoretically, sterile neutrinos are naturally included in Type-I seesaw model

[79, 82]. But their mass scale is usually very high to account for the small mass

of the neutrinos. Light sub-eV sterile neutrinos as suggested by the data can

arise in many models [112].

Irrespective of the mechanism for generation of neutrino masses the low en-

ergy Majorana mass matrix in presence of an extra sterile neutrino will be of
dimension 4 × 4 with ten independent entries and is given as,

There are two ways in which one can add a predominantly sterile state sep-

the additional neutrino can be of higher mass than the other three while in the

In the ﬁrst case

second case the the fourth neutrino is the lightest state. The later turns out to

be incompatible with cosmology since in this case three active neutrinos, each
with mass ∼ eV results in an enhanced cosmological energy density. Thus it
suﬃces to consider only the ﬁrst case which admits two possibilities displayed in

Fig. 4.1. These are:

(i) SNH: in this m1 ≈ m2 < m3 < m4 corresponding to a normal hierarchy

(NH) among the active neutrinos which implies,

m2 = pm2

1 + ∆21 , m3 = pm2

1 + ∆21 + ∆32 , m4 = pm2

1 + ∆41.

(ii) SIH : this corresponds to m3 < m2 ≈ m1 < m4 implying an inverted

ordering among the active neutrinos with masses expressed as,

m1 = pm2

3 + ∆31 , m2 = pm2

3 + ∆31 + ∆21 , m4 = √m3 + ∆43,

(QD) where the three active neutrinos have approximately equal masses i.e.,
SQD: where |m4| ≫ |m1| ≈ |m2| ≈ |m3| ≈ m0.

In the 3+1 scenario, the neutrino mixing matrix, V in the ﬂavor basis will
be a 4 × 4 unitary matrix. As described in the introduction, in general a N ×
N unitary mixing matrix contains N (N −1)

It will also have (N-1) number of additional

Majorana phases if neutrinos are Majorana particles. So in our case V can be

parametrized in terms of sixteen parameters. In addition to the three mixing

angles between the active ﬂavors, (θ13, θ12, θ23) we now have three more mixing

angles from sterile and active mixing, (θ14, θ24, θ34). There are six CP violating

phases, three Dirac (δ13, δ14, δ24) and three additional Majorana phases as (α,

β, γ) as neutrinos here are considered to be Majorana particles. Then, there are

four masses of neutrino m1, m2, m3 corresponding to three active states and m4

which is predominantly the mass of heavy sterile neutrino.

The mixing matrix V can be expressed as V = U.P [254] where

U = R34 ˜R24 ˜R14R23 ˜R13R12,

viz.

Mν(pq) = 0.

where a, b, p and q can take the values e, µ, τ and s. The above Eq. 4.5 can be

written as

The modulus of these quantities gives the magnitudes xm, ym while the argument

determines the Majorana phases α and β.

xm = |x| , ym = |y|

α = arg (x) , β = arg (y) .

(4.11)

(4.12)

Thus, the number of free parameters is ﬁve, the lowest mass m1 (NH) or m3

(IH), three Dirac and one Majorana type CP phases. We can check for the two
mass spectra in terms of the magnitude of the mass ratios xm, ym and zm = |z|
as,

• SNH which corresponds to xm < 1 , ym < 1 and zm > 1.

• SIH which implies xm < 1 , ym > 1 and zm > 1.

Thus, it is ym which determines if the hierarchy among the three light neu-

trinos is normal or inverted. Note that if the three light neutrinos are quasi-
degenerate then we will have xm ≈ ym ≈ 1. Unlike the three generation case,
the lowest mass cannot be determined in the four neutrino analysis in terms of

xm and ym since these ratios also depend on m1 through z. Thus, we keep the

lowest mass as a free parameter. To ﬁnd out the allowed two-zero textures we

adopt the following procedure.

We vary the lowest mass randomly from 0 to 0.5 eV. The upper limit chosen

by us is guided by the cosmological upper bound on neutrino masses. All the

ﬁve mixing angles (apart from θ34) and the three mass-squared diﬀerences are

distributed normally about the best-ﬁt values with their corresponding 1σ errors

as given in Table 4.25. The three Dirac and one Majorana type CP phase as

well as the remaining mixing angle θ34 are randomly generated. Then, we use

the above conditions to ﬁnd out which mass spectrum is consistent with the par-

ticular texture zero structure under consideration. We also calculate the three

4.4.2 Results and Discussions

In this section we present the results of our analysis. First we brieﬂy discuss
the results that we obtain for the two-zero textures of the 3 × 3 mass matrices.
Next we present the results that we obtain for the 3+1 scenario i.e., 4 × 4 mass
matrices.

4.4.2.1 Results for 3 Active Neutrino Mass Matrix

For the 3 neutrino case, the lowest mass and the two Majorana phases can be

determined from the mass ratios. Hence, the only unknown parameter is the

Dirac type CP phase (δ13) which is generated randomly. All the other oscillation

parameters are distributed normally, peaked at the best-ﬁt and taking their one

sigma error as width.

In our analysis, we ﬁnd that all 7 textures which were allowed previously (as

discussed in section 4.2) remain so. However, the textures belonging to A class

allow NH whereas for the B class, B1 and B3 admit NH and B2 and B4 allow

IH solutions. Class C gets allowed only for IH. The D, E and F classes remain

disallowed. This is summarized in the second column of Table 4.4. We also

display the results that we obtain for the two-zero neutrino mass matrices with

three active neutrinos using random distribution of the oscillation parameters.

The results obtained in this case are somewhat diﬀerent from that obtained using

normal distribution of oscillation parameters. The reason for the diﬀerence stems

from the diﬀerent range of values of the atmospheric mixing angle θ23 used by
these methods. If we assume a Gaussian distribution for sin2 θ23 around its best-

ﬁt then there is very less probability of getting the 3σ range in the higher octant

as these values lie near the tail of the Gaussian distribution. This disallow B2 and

B4 for NH and B1 and B3 for IH [236]. Similarly QD solutions for B class requires
θ23 ∼ π/4 [228] and for a normal distribution of θ23 with the peak at present
best-ﬁt the 3σ range extends up to ∼ 44o and there is very little probability of
getting values close to 45◦. Similarly for the C class NH and QD solutions are

allowed only for θ23 values close to 45◦ and hence is not admissible when Gaussian

4.4.2.2 Results for 3+1 Scenario

Adding one sterile neutrino, there exist in total forty ﬁve texture structures of

the neutrino mass matrix which can have two zeros.

(i) Among these the 9 cases with |mss|= 0 eV are disallowed as the mass matrix
s4 which is large from the current data

element mss contains the term m4U 2
and suppresses the other terms. Hence, |mss| cannot vanish.

(ii) There are 21 cases where one has at least one zero involving the mass
matrix element of the sterile part i.e., |mks| =0 eV where k = e, µ, τ . This
element is of the form,

mks = m1Uk1Us1 + m2Uk2Us2e−iα

(4.15)

+ m3Uk3Us3ei(2δ13−β) + m4Uk4Us4ei(2δ14−γ).

The last term in this expression contains the product m4Us4 which is mostly

large as compared to ﬁrst three terms and thus, there can be no cancella-

tions. However, it is possible that in the regime where the active neutrinos

136

Chapter 4. Neutrino Mass Matrices

are quasi-degenerate, their contribution can match the contribution from

the sterile part. But we have checked that in any case, it is not possible to

obtain a two-zero texture with these elements. Thus we can exclude these

21 cases from the allowed two-zero textures.

We will elaborate these points further in the next section at the time of

discussing one zero texture.

(iii) The remaining cases are the 15 two-zero cases for which none of the sterile

components are zero. Thus, these also belong to the two-zero textures of

the three generation mass matrix. A general element in this category can

be expressed as,

mkl = m1Uk1Ul1 + m2Uk2Ul2e−iα

(4.16)

+ m3Uk3Ul3ei(2δ13−β) + m4Uk4Ul4ei(2δ14−γ).

here, k, l = e, µ, τ . We ﬁnd all these 15 textures, presented in Table 4.3 get

allowed with the inclusion of the sterile neutrino. This can be attributed to

additional cancellations that the last term in Eq. 4.16 induces. Table 4.4

displays the nature of the mass spectra that are admissible in the allowed

textures.

In Fig. 4.2 we present the values of ym vs the lowest mass for representative

textures A1, B1, C, D1, E3 and F1 from the 6 classes. The other textures

belonging to each class give similar results. This ﬁgure shows that for

textures belonging to the A class ym remains < 1. Thus, it admits only

NH solutions. The textures belonging to the D and E class allow NH and

IH while the B, C, and F classes allow NH, IH and QD mass spectra.

The textures A1 − A2, B1 − B2, B3 − B4, D1 − D2, E1 − E2 and F2 − F3 are
related by Sµτ symmetry where for the four neutrino framework Sµτ can

be expressed as,

Note that for 3 generation case the angle θ23 in the partner textures linked
by µ − τ symmetry was related as ¯θ23 = ( π

case no such simple relations are obtained for the mixing angle θ23. The
angles θ24 and θ34 in the two textures related by µ − τ symmetry are also
diﬀerent. For this case, the mixing angles for two textures linked by Sµτ

The texture zero conditions together with the constraints imposed by the

experimental data allow us to obtain correlations between various parameters

specially the mixing angles of the 4th neutrino with the other three for the A and

E classes. For the B, C, D and F classes one gets constraints on the eﬀective

mass governing 0νββ.

In order to gain some analytic insight into the results it is important to

understand the mass scales involved in the problem. The solar mass scale is

√∆21 ≈ 0.009 eV whereas the atmospheric mass scale is √∆31 ≈ 0.05 eV. Normal

hierarchy among the active neutrinos implies m1 << m2 << m3 corresponding
to m1 <∼ 0.009 eV. It is also possible that m1 ≈ m2 << m3 implying m1 ∼ (0.009-
0.1) eV. We call this partial normal hierarchy. IH corresponds to m3 << m1 ≈
m2. If on the other hand m1 > 0.1 eV then m1 ≈ m2 ≈ m3 which corresponds
to quasi-degenerate neutrinos.

• A and E Class

For these classes we ﬁnd ym to be mainly in the range > 0.0001 eV ex-
tending up to ∼ 0.1 eV. Thus, these classes allow normal hierarchy (full
or partial) among the 3 active neutrinos. These classes are characterised

For smaller values of m1 and NH, the dominant contribution to the magni-

0.022. Therefore, very small values of m1 is less likely to give vanishing mee

for normal hierarchy. However, we get some allowed points in the small

m1 regime which implies smaller values of s2

14. mee can be approximated

in the small m1 limit as,

mee ≈ e−iαm2s2

The maximum magnitude of the ﬁrst two terms is ∼ 0.003. Then using
typical values of m4 (∼ 0.9 eV) from the 3σ range, we obtain s2
14 ∼ (0.003−
0.004) in the small m1 limit. This is true for all the textures in the A and
E class. For the A1 class we also simultaneously need vanishing |meµ|. In
the small m1 limit approximate expression for meµ is

meµ ≈ ei(δ14−δ24−γ)s14s24m4

+ ei(δ13−β)s13s23m3 + e−iαc12c23s12m2,

(4.23)

and the ﬁrst term i.e., m4s14s24 ∼ (0.05 − 0.06)s24. While the other terms
are of the order (0.006 - 0.007) which implies s2
24 ∼ (0.01 − 0.02). This is
reﬂected in the ﬁrst and second panels of Fig. 4.3 where the correlation of

24 with m1 is depicted. As m1 increases the contribution from the

s2
14 and s2
ﬁrst three terms in mee increases and s2

14 becomes larger for cancellation to

occur. For meµ, this increase in s14 helps to achieve cancellation for higher

values of m1 and therefore s2

24 stays almost the same. Similar argument

also apply to the E1 class which has vanishing mµµ.

For A2 class, in addition we have vanishing meτ . In the limit of small m1,

meτ can be approximated as,

meτ ≈ ei(δ14−δ24−γ)s14s34m4 + ei(δ13−β)s2

13m3 − m2e−iαs12c12s23.

(4.24)

As discussed earlier vanishing mee implies small s2

14 ∼ (0.002 − 0.005)
in the limit of small m1. Thus, the contribution from the m4 term is
∼ (0.04 − 0.06)s34. The typical contribution from the last two terms is
∼ 0.008. This implies s2
34 to be in the range (0.02 -0.04) for smaller values
of m1. This is reﬂected in the third panels of Fig. 4.3 where we have plotted

34 with m1. Since with increasing m1, s14 increases to
34 does not increase further. Similar bounds on s2

34 are

As one approaches the QD regime then the terms containing the active

neutrino masses starts contributing more. So for higher values of m1 com-

plete cancellation leading to vanishing mee even at the highest value of s2
14

is not possible. This feature restricts m1 to be < 0.1 eV in A class.

Textures belonging to A and E class contain banishing mee which is not

possible for IH in the three generation case since the solar mixing angle

is not maximal. In the 3+1 scenario a cancellation leading to vanishing

mee is possible for IH. In this case, the condition mee = 0 constraints the

majorana phases as 80o < α < 280o, 160o < γ < 220o and the 1-4 mixing

angle as s2

14 as 0.017 < s2

14 < 0.042. These conditions are not compatible

with the condition of vanishing meµ or meτ for IH. Therefore, class A which

simultaneously requires one of these elements to vanish along with mee is

disfavoured for IH. On the other hand, the elements i.e., mµµ, mµτ or mτ τ

can assume zero value satisfying these constraints. Thus E class which has

mee together with one of these elements as vanishing can have inverted

hierarchical spectrum.

For vanishing mee, the eﬀective mass (mef f = |mee|) governing the neutri-
noless double beta decay (0νββ) is also vanishing for these classes.

• B, C Classes

In the 3+1 scenario, B and C classes allow all three mass spectra – NH,

IH and QD assuming the known oscillation parameters to be normally

distributed (cf. Table 4.4). In this case since θ23 in the textures related by
µ − τ symmetry is not correlated in a simple way, the value of this angle
not being in the higher octant does not play a signiﬁcant role as in the 3

generation case. Among these only B1 allow few points for smaller values

of m1 for NH. For the IH solution, larger number of points are obtained

corresponding to the lowest mass > 0.01 eV as is seen from Fig. 4.2. In

these textures, for higher values of the lowest mass the active neutrino

contribution to the matrix elements are larger and it is easier to obtain

cancellations. Hence, textures belonging to these classes show a preference

for QD solutions. For these textures the eﬀective mass governing 0νββ is

4.4. Analysis of Two-Zero Textures

143

non-zero. In the ﬁrst row of Fig. 4.4 we present the eﬀective mass as a

function of the lowest mass for the textures B1, B3 and C for both NH and

IH. These two merge at higher values of the lowest mass corresponding to

the QD solution. The eﬀective mass in these textures is > 0.002 eV for

NH and > 0.02 eV for IH. If no signal is seen in future 0νββ experiments

then large part of the parameter space belonging to these textures can be

disfavoured.

• D, F Classes

These two textures are disallowed in the three generation case. However

for the 3+1 scenario they get allowed. NH is admissible in all the textures

belonging to these classes. The reason for this is the following.
In the three active neutrino scenario, the neutrino mass matrix in a µ − τ
block has the elements of the order of √∆32 ≈ 0.01eV for normal hierarchy.

Thus, in general these elements are quite large and cannot vanish [228].

However, in the 3+1 case when there is one additional sterile neutrino, the

neutrino mass matrix elements get contribution from the sterile part of the

form m4Uk4Ul4 where k = e, µ, τ . This term is almost of the same order of

magnitude and thus can cancel the active part, resulting into the possibility
of vanishing elements in the µ − τ block. Thus, the zero textures which
were disallowed for NH are now allowed by the inclusion of sterile neutrino

(3+1 case). In the case of IH, mµτ element for three active neutrinos is

always of the order of √∆32 ≈ 0.01eV and thus the textures D1, D2, F2,

F3 which requires mµτ to vanish, were not allowed. However, for the 3+1

scenario the extra term coming due to the fourth state helps in additional

cancellations and IH gets allowed in these (cf. Table 4.4). For F1 class,

IH for three active neutrino is disfavored because of phase correlations.

However, with the additional sterile neutrino this can be evaded making

it allowed. In the bottom row of Fig. 4.4 we present the eﬀective mass

governing 0νββ for the textures D1, F1 and F2 as a function of the lowest

mass. The texture D1 allows lower values of m1 for NH while for IH the

144

Chapter 4. Neutrino Mass Matrices

lowest mass is largely >∼ 0.01 eV. QD solution is not allowed in D class .

For F class more points are obtained in the QD regime. Future experiments

on 0νββ would be able to probe these regions of parameter space.

The results presented above are obtained by varying the known oscillation

parameters distributed normally around their best-ﬁt and with a width given by

the 1σ range of the parameters. There is a ﬁnite probability of getting the points

in the 3σ range of this Gaussian distribution although more points are selected

near the best-ﬁt values. However, note that for some of the parameters the 3σ

range obtained in this procedure is diﬀerent from the 3σ range of the global ﬁts.

Thus, our results may change if we vary the parameters randomly in their 3σ

range as we have seen in the 3 generation case. In Fig. 4.5 we show the allowed

values of ym as a function of the lowest mass for the case where all the parameters

are varied randomly in their 3σ range. We ﬁnd that lower values of the smallest

mass get disfavored by this method. The main reason for this is that if we use

the Gaussian method then the allowed 3σ range of the mixing angle s2

14 is from

(0.002 - 0.048) while that of s2

24 is from (0.001 - 0.06). Thus, smaller values

of s2

14 and s2

24 are possible which helps in achieving cancellation conditions for

smaller values of m1 or m3. But if the parameters are varied randomly in the 3σ

range then such smaller values of the angles are not allowed and consequently no

allowed points are obtained for smaller values of masses. In particular, we obtain

m1 (NH) or m3 (IH) > 0.01 eV in all the textures. However, main conclusions

presented in Table 4.4 regarding the nature of the allowed mass spectrum for

the 3+1 scenario remain unchanged though the allowed parameter space gets

reduced. Specially for the A, E and C classes very few points get allowed. Fully

hierarchical neutrinos (m1 < m2 < m3) are not possible in any of the textures.

Textures belonging to the B and F classes give more points in the QD regime.

D class allows partial NH or IH.

4.5.2 Neutrino Mass Matrix Elements

In this section we study the implication of the condition of vanishing mαβ for the

3+1 scenario, where α, β = e, µ, τ, s. Since mαβ is complex the above condition

implies both real and imaginary parts are zero. Therefore to study the one-
zero textures we consider |mαβ| = 0. The best-ﬁt values and the 3σ ranges of the
sterile neutrino parameters which we have used in this part our analysis are given

in Table 4.5 where we also present the mass ratios ζ and ξ which would be useful

in our analysis. For the oscillation parameters involving the active neutrinos we

use the global analysis results of Ref. [127] which we also used in our analysis of

two-zero textures (presented in Table 4.2). In this part of the analysis we have

varied all the parameters randomly between their allowed ranges, three Dirac

phases in the range 0 to 2π and the three Majorana phases from 0 to π.

The contribution of the sterile neutrino to the element mee depends on the mass

m4 and the active-sterile mixing angle θ14. Of all the mass matrix element mee has

the simplest form because of the chosen parametrization and can be understood

quite well. Using approximation in Eq. 4.27 for the case of extreme hierarchy

one can write this for NH as,

mee ≈ c2

The modulus of mee is the eﬀective mass that can be extracted from half-life

measurements in neutrinoless double beta decay. In Fig. 4.6 we plot the eﬀective

mass as a function of the smallest mass by varying θ14 in its complete 3σ range

as well as for speciﬁc values of the mixing angle θ14. The Majorana phases

are varied randomly in the range 0 to π in all the plots. The ﬁrst panel is for

θ14 = 0 i.e., the three generation case. It is seen that for present values of the
oscillation parameters the cancellation condition is not satisﬁed for m1 → 0 for
NH. However, as one increases m1, complete cancellation can be achieved. For

IH the complete cancellation is never possible. These results change when we

include the sterile contribution as is evident from the panel (b) in Fig. 4.6 which

shows the eﬀective mass for NH and IH by varying all the parameters in their

full 3σ allowed range. The behaviour can be understood from the expressions
of |mee| in various limiting cases. For NH, in the hierarchical limit of m1 → 0
the major contributor will be the additional term due to the sterile neutrinos

because of higher value of m4. Complete cancellation is only possible for smaller

values of θ14 so that this contribution is suppressed. The typical value of θ14

required for cancellation can be obtained by putting α = β = 0 (which would

maximize the three neutrino contribution) and γ = π/2, as

tan2 θ14 ≈

13)

≈ 10−3,

(4.33)

4.5. Analysis of One-Zero Textures

149

which lies outside the allowed range of θ14. As we increase m1, (mee)3ν increases

and can be of the same order of magnitude of the sterile term. Hence one can

get cancellation regions. The cancellation is mainly controlled by the value of

θ14. For higher values of s2

14 one needs a higher value of m1 for cancellation to

occur. This correlation between m1 and θ14 is brought out by the panels (c) and

(d) in Fig. 4.6.

For IH case, in the limit of vanishing m3 using approximation in Eq. 4.28,

mee in a 3+1 scenario can be written as

|mee| ≈ |c2

13p∆31(c2
14c2

12 + s2

12e2iα) +p∆43s2

14e2iγ|.

(4.34)

The maximum value of this is achieved for α = γ = 0 which is slightly lower
than that of NH in this limit. The element vanishes in the limit m3 ≈ 0 eV when
α = 0 and γ = π/2 provided

tan2 θ14 ≈

c2
13√ξ ≈ 0.05.

(4.35)

This is well within the allowed range. This behaviour is in stark contrast to that

in the 3 neutrino case [257] . There is no signiﬁcant change in this behaviour as

the smallest mass m3 is increased since this contribution is suppressed by the s2
13

term and the dominant contribution to (mee)3ν comes from the ﬁrst two terms

in Eq. 4.30. Therefore in this case we do not observe any correlation between

m3 and s2

14.

While moving towards the quasi-degenerate regime of m1 ≈ m2 ≈ m3 we ﬁnd
that eﬀective mass can still be zero. However, when the lightest mass approaches
a larger value ∼ 0.3 eV we need very large values of active sterile mixing angle
θ14, outside the allowed range, for cancellation. Hence the eﬀective mass cannot

vanish for such values of masses.

Also shown is the current limit on eﬀective mass from combined KamLAND-

Zen and EXO 200 results on the half-life of 0νββ in 136Xe [258, 259]. When
translated in terms of eﬀective mass this corresponds to the bound |mee| <
0.11 − 0.24 eV including nuclear matrix element uncertainties. For the three
generation case, the hierarchical neutrinos cannot saturate this bound. But in

150

Chapter 4. Neutrino Mass Matrices

the 3+1 scenario this bound can be reached even for very small values of m3 for

IH and for some parameter values it can even exceed the current limit. Thus

from the present limits on neutrinoless double beta decay searches a part of the

parameter space for smaller values of m3 can be disfavoured for IH. For NH, the

KamLAND-Zen + EXO 200 combined bound is reached for m1 = 0.02 eV and

again some part of the parameter space can be disfavoured by this bound.

4.5.2.2 The Mass Matrix Element meµ

The mass matrix element meµ in the presence of extra sterile neutrino is given

as

meµ = c14(ei(δ14−δ24+2γ)m4s14s24 + ei(δ13+2β)m3s13(c13c24s23 − ei(δ14−δ13−δ24)

(4.36)
s13s14s24) + c12c13m1(−c23c24s12 + c12(−eiδ13c24s13s23 − ei(δ14−δ24)c13s14s24))

+ e2iαm2c13s12(c12c23c24 + s12(−eiδ13c24s13s23 − ei(δ14−δ24)c13s14s24))).

Unlike mee here the expression is complicated and an analytic understanding is

diﬃcult from the full expression. The expression for meµ in the limit of vanishing

active sterile mixing angle θ24 becomes

meµ = c14(meµ)3ν.

Since the active sterile mixing is small, in order to simplify these expressions we
introduce a quantity λ ≡0.2 and deﬁne these small angles to be of the form aλ.
Thus a systematic expansion in terms of λ can be done. For sterile mixing angle

sinθ14 ≈ θ14 ≡ χ14λ,
sinθ24 ≈ θ24 ≡ χ24λ,

and the reactor mixing angle as

sin θ13 ≈ θ13 ≡ χ13λ.

(4.37)

(4.38)

4.5. Analysis of One-Zero Textures

151

Here χij are parameters of O(1) and their 3σ range from the current constraint
on the mixing angles is given by

χ13 = 0.65 − 0.9,
χ14 = 0.5 − 1.2,
χ24 = 0.25 − 1.

(4.39)

Note that for the sterile mixing angle θ34 we do not adopt the above approxima-

tion because this angle can be large compared to other two sterile mixing angles

and hence the small parameter approximation will not be valid.

Using the approximation in Eqs. 4.27, 4.37 and 4.38 we get the expression

for |meµ| for normal hierarchy as

|meµ| ≈ |p∆32{pζs12c12c23e2iα + eiδ13(e2iβ − e2iαpζs2

12)s23λχ13 (4.40)

+ λ2ei(δ14−δ24)(e2iγpξ − e2iαpζs2

12)χ14χ24}|.

To see the order of magnitude of the diﬀerent terms we choose vanishing Majo-

rana phases while Dirac CP phases are taken as π. The mass matrix element

meµ vanishes when

pζs12c12c23 − (1 −pζs2

12)s23λχ13 + λ2(pξ −pζs2

12)χ14χ24 = 0.

(4.41)

The three generation limit is recovered for s2
24 = 0 and in panel (a) of Fig. 4.7 we
show |meµ| as a function of m1 of this case, for NH. Panel (b) (red/light region)
of Fig. 4 shows |meµ| for the 3+1 case, with all parameters varied randomly
within their 3σ range. The ﬁgures show that |meµ| = 0 can be achieved over the
whole range of the smallest mass for both 3 and 3+1 cases. However, we ﬁnd

that in the hierarchical limit cancellation is not achieved for large values of θ24,
since in that case the third term of Eq. 4.41 will be of the O (10−1) compared
to the leading order term which is of the O (10−2) and hence there will be no
cancellation of these terms. This can be seen from panel (b) (green/dark region)

of Fig. 4.7 for s2
24 = 0.04. In the QD limit the contribution from the active terms
are large enough to cancel the sterile contribution and thus |meµ| = 0 can be
achieved.

all the parameters varying in their allowed range. Note that in the small m3 limit

for α = 0 the leading order term vanishes. For this case, for large active sterile
mixing angle θ24, the λ2 term becomes large O (10−1) and the cancellation with
λ term is not be possible. When CP violating phase α is non zero, the leading

α = 0, cancellation is not achieved for smaller values of m3. Thus the condition
|meµ| = 0 implies some correlation between m3 and α for IH. Even if α is varied
in its full range, the absolute value of the matrix element |meµ| can vanish only
if the product χ14χ24 is small, i.e., s2
24 are simultaneously small . This
is because if they are large the λ2 term becomes of the O (10−1) and hence
cancellation will not be possible. This is seen from panel (d) where for s2

phase α = π/2 makes the magnitude of leading order term (s12c12c23√ζ) quite
large and smaller values of θ24 cannot give cancellation even for large values of m3

which can be seen from panel (e) of Fig. 4.8. For the occurrence of cancellation
s2
24 has to be ≥ 0.01 for α = π/2 as can be seen from panel (f) where we have
plotted the correlation between α and s2

4.5.2.3 The Mass Matrix Element meτ

The mass matrix element meτ in the presence of an extra sterile neutrino is given

by

meτ = c14c24ei(2γ+δ14)m4s14s34 + m3c14s13ei(2β+δ13)(−c24s13s14s34ei(δ14−δ13)

(4.44)

+ c13(c23c34 − eiδ24s23s24s34)) + m2s12c13c14e2iα(c12(−c34s23 − c23s24s34eiδ24)
+ s12(−c13c24s14s34eiδ14 − eiδ13s13(c23c34 − eiδ24s23s24s34)))
+ m1c12c13c14(−s12(−c34s23 − c23s24s34eiδ24) + c12(−c13c24s14s34eiδ14 − eiδ13s13

(c23c34 − eiδ24s23s24s34))).

As mentioned in the previous section, the elements meτ and meµ are related by
µ − τ permutation symmetry and it is found that in the limit of small θ24 the
two active sterile mixing angles ¯θ24 ≈ θ34. (Eq. 4.17) The same can be seen from
Eq. 4.19 which gives ¯θ34 ≈ θ24 for smaller values of the mixing angle θ34. Thus,
for these cases the behaviour shown by θ24 in meµ (mµµ) is same as shown by θ34

in meτ (mτ τ ).

In the limit of vanishing active sterile mixing angle θ34 this element becomes

meτ = c14(meτ )3ν.

Using the approximation in Eq. 4.27 for NH the above element can be expressed

as,

|meτ| ≈ |p∆32{−s12s23c12c34pζe2iα + λ(c23c34ei(2β+δ13)χ13 − c23c34s2

rameters are varied in their full allowed range and the green/dark region is for

s2
34 = 0.18 with all the other parameters covering their full range.

For the case of vanishing Majorana phases and Dirac phases having the value π,

this element can vanish when

For a vanishing active sterile mixing angle θ34 one recovers the 3 generation case.

In this limit, from Eq. 4.46 one observes that the leading order term and the
term with λ are of the same order ∼ O (10−2) while the λ2 term vanishes and
hence cancellation is possible excepting for very low values of the lightest mass.

We can see this in panel (a) of Fig. 4.9.

In panel (b) (red/light region) all

the parameters are varied randomly (3+1 case) and cancellation is seen to be

possible over the whole range of m1. In panel (b) (green/dark region) we also
plot the element |meτ| for the upper limit of s2
no cancellation for very low values of the smallest mass. This is because when
s2
34 is large, the λ term containing ξ becomes large O (1) and there will be no
cancellation.

λ(c23c34χ13 + s34χ14 − s34χ14pξ) + s23s34χ13χ24λ2 = 0.

(4.48)

In panel (a) of Fig. 4.10 the three generation case is reproduced by putting

s2
34 = 0 and in (b) all the parameters are varied in their allowed range (3+1

case). In both the ﬁgures we can see that cancellation is permissible over the

whole range of m3 considered. When the CP violating phase α = 0 we see that

the leading order term (sin 2θ12s23c34) vanishes and as a result for large values of

s2
34 the cancellation is not possible because the term with coeﬃcient λ becomes
large (O(10−1)). For non zero values of the CP violating phase α this leading
order term is non zero and its contribution will be signiﬁcant. So in this case

high values of θ34 are also allowed because now the leading order and the term

with coeﬃcient λ will be of same magnitude. When we ﬁx s2

34 = 0.06 and α = 0

the region where m3 is small is disallowed (panel (c) blue/dark region) but when

α varies within its full range the disallowed regions become allowed (panel (c)

cyan/light region). When s2

34 approaches its upper limit, the λ term having ξ

becomes very large and cancellation is not possible even for non zero values of

α which can be seen from panel (d). However, when α = π/2, very small values

of s2

34 cannot give cancellation as the leading order term becomes large (panel
34 has to be ≥ 0.01 for the term to vanish which can be seen from panel

(e)). s2

This expression reduces to its three generation case if the mixing angle θ24 van-

ishes. Also we can see from the expression that there is no dependence on the

mixing angle θ34. Using the approximation in Eqs. 4.27 this element can be

simpliﬁed to the form

(4.51)

We know that for the case of 3 generations, the elements in the µ − τ block are
quite large and cannot vanish for normal hierarchy. In panel (a) of Fig. 4.11 we
can see that |mµµ| cannot vanish in small m1 region for s2
the 3 generation case. This is because the magnitude of the ﬁrst two terms in
Eq. 4.51 is quite large in this case, ∼ O (10−1) and for cancellation to occur the
term with coeﬃcient λ2 has to be of the same order. This is not possible when

24 = 0 which is indeed

s2
24 is small. However when s2

24 is varied in its full allowed range the contribution

of the sterile part is enhanced and this can cancel the active part as can be seen

from panel (b). Now to understand the dependence of mµµ with θ24 we note that

if we increase s2

24 from its lower bound then the two terms become of the same

order. So there will be regions in the limit of small m1 for which this element

vanishes (panel (c)). We see in panel (d) of Fig. 4.11 that when θ24 acquires
very large values, the magnitude of the λ2 (√ξχ2
leading to non cancellation of the terms with the leading order ﬁrst two terms.

24) term becomes large, thus

Hence, the region with very small m1 is not allowed. Using the approximation

24 because in this case all the terms are of same

order and there can always be cancellations. However, if we put α = 0 then

the term λ (sin 2θ12s23c23χ13) drops out from the equation and the leading order

term can not be canceled for small values of s2

24. It can be seen from panel (c)

that for s2

24 = 0.002 and α = 0 the regions where m3 is small is not allowed. As

the value of θ24 increases there is the possibility of cancellation of terms for all
the values of α as can be seen from panel (d) where we plot |mµµ| with the lowest

4.5.2.5 The Mass Matrix Element mµτ

The (2,3) element of Mν in the ﬂavor basis becomes quite complicated in the

presence of an extra sterile neutrino. The expression is

mµτ = ei(2δ14−δ24+2γ)c2

14c24m4s24s34

(4.54)

+ e2i(δ13+β)m3(c13c24s23 − ei(δ14−δ24−δ13)s13s14s24)

{−ei(δ14−δ13)c24s13s14s34 + c13(c23c34 − eiδ24s23s24s34)}

+ m1{−c23c24s12 + c12(−eiδ13c24s13s23 − ei(δ14−δ24)c13s14s24)}

[−s12(−c34s23 − eiδ24c23s24s34)

+ c12{−eiδ14c13c24s14s34 − eiδ13s13(c23c34 − eiδ24s23s24s34)}]
+ e2iαm2{c12c23c24 + s12(−eiδ13c24s13s23 − ei(δ14−δ24)c13s14s24)}

[c12(−c34s23 − eiδ24c23s24s34)

+ s12{−eiδ14c13c24s14s34 − eiδ13s13(c23c34 − eiδ24s23s24s34)}].

It reduces to the 3 generation case when θ24 = θ34 = 0. In the normal hierarchi-

cal region where m1 can assume very small values and can be neglected, using

approximations in Eqs. 4.27, 4.37 and 4.38 we get

|mµτ| ≈ |p∆32{c23c34(e2i(β+δ13) − e2iαpζc2

Chapter 4. Neutrino Mass Matrices

Being an element of µτ block, mµτ shows the same behaviour that of mµµ in
normal hierarchy. In panel (a) of Fig. 4.13 we plotted |mµτ| for s2
which coincides with the 3 generation case and we can see that cancellation is

24 = s2

34 = 0

not possible in hierarchical region. However, when all the parameters are varied

in their allowed range in panel (b) it get contribution from the sterile part and

cancellation is always possible. It can also be seen from panel (c) of Fig. 4.13

that for s2

34 = 0 there is no cancellation in the region when m1 is small and

the ﬁgure is quite similar to that of 3 generation case. However, as this active

sterile mixing angle becomes larger there is always a possibility of allowed region

towards the lower values of m1 as is evident from panel (d). This is because

for the vanishing value of θ34 the terms with λ and λ2 become very small and
cannot cancel the leading term O (10−1). It can also be seen that in this case
(i.e., s2
34 = 0), there is no χ24 term and this is why the ﬁgure is somewhat similar

to the 3 generation case. However, when θ34 increases these two contributions

become large and cancellation becomes possible.

For the case of inverted hierarchy where m3 can have very small values, mµτ

becomes

|mµτ| ≈ |p∆31{−c23c34s23(c2

To get an idea about the magnitude of the terms we take vanishing Majorana

In panel (a) of Fig. 4.14, where |mµτ| for 3 generation is plotted, we can see that
unlike mµµ there is no cancellation in small m3 region but when plotted for the

full range it gets contribution from the sterile part and there is cancellation for

the full range of m3 (panel (b)). Clearly the cancellation of the terms do not

become possible for small values of θ34 in strict hierarchical region. This case is

similar to the three generation case in IH (cyan/light region, panel (c)). This is

because for s2

34 = 0 the contribution of s2

24 comes from the λ2 term. If we put the

CP violating phase α as zero then cancellation is not possible for whole range of

m3 (blue/dark region panel (c)). However, as the value of s2

34 increases all the

terms in the above equation becomes of the same order and cancellation for very

small values of m3 is possible (panel (d)).

It reduces to the 3 generation case for θ34 = 0. Using the approximation for

normal hierarchy in Eqs. 4.27, 4.37 and 4.38 this becomes

(4.61)

For vanishing θ34, which is the case for 3 generation, mτ τ = 0 is disallowed

for small m1 as can be seen from panel (a) of Fig. 4.15. This is the generic
behaviour of a element belonging to the µ − τ block in normal hierarchy which
we mentioned previously. This is because for θ34 equal to zero the leading order
term is large (O (10−1)). Here the term with λ2 is quite small (10−3-10−4) and
hence will not have very signiﬁcant role to play. Thus, only terms with coeﬃcient

λ can cancel the leading order term. However, for vanishing θ34 this term is small
O (10−3), and cannot cancel the leading order term. In panel (b) when all the
parameters are varied in their 3σ range we can see that cancellation is possible

over the whole range of m1 (3+1 case). Now, when θ34 starts increasing from its

lowest value there exist a region for intermediate values where both the terms

become approximately of the same order and hence there can be cancellations

(panel (c)). Towards very large values of θ34 the term with coeﬃcient λ becomes

34 = 0 all the terms are of same order and cancellations are always

possible. But if we put α = 0 then one term with coeﬃcient λ and another

term with coeﬃcient λ2 drops out from the equation and then small values of s2
34

can not cancel the leading order term any more. This can be seen from panel

(c) where cancellation is not possible for lower m3 region. However when s2
34

increases to a value of about 0.02 this element can vanish (panel (d) the cyan

becomes large O(1). Hence, the other terms are not able to cancel this term and
we do not get small m3 region allowed (Panel (d), blue region).

Though the equations seem very complex, one can easily understand the

properties of these elements by just looking at the m4 terms. The m4 term in
mes is proportional to s14. So in general it is quite large (O(1)). For this element
to become negligible very small values of s2
14 is required. But as this angle is

bounded by the SBL experiments, complete cancellations never occurs for both

normal and inverted hierarchy (Panel (a), (b) of Fig. 4.17). Similar predictions

are obtained for mµs element which cannot vanish since s2

24 has to be negligible

which is not allowed by the data. This can be seen from Panel (c), (d) of Fig.

4.17. For the element mτ s the scenario is quite diﬀerent. In this case the m4 term

is proportional to θ34 and there is no lower bound on it from the SBL experiments

i.e.

it can approach smaller values. As a result the term with m4 can be very

small. Thus this matrix element can possibly vanish in both hierarchies for whole

range of the lowest mass (Panel (e), (f)).

4.6 Summary

In this chapter we have studied the structure of the low energy neutrino mass

matrix in terms of texture zeros in the presence of one light sterile neutrino. In

Section 4.4, we have analyzed the two-zero textures in 3+1 scenario. We ﬁnd

many distinctive features in this case as compared to the three neutrino scenario.

For the 3+1 case there can be 45 possible two zero textures as opposed to 15 for

the 3 generation case. Among these 45 possible two-zero textures only 15 survive

the constraints from global oscillation data. Interestingly these 15 cases are the

15 two-zero textures that are possible for three active neutrino mass matrices.

While for the three active neutrino case only 7 of these were allowed addition

of one sterile neutrino make all 15 cases allowed as the sterile contribution can

be instrumental for additional cancellations leading to zeros. All the allowed

textures admit NH. IH is permissible in all the textures excepting those in the A

class. The classes B, C, F also allow QD solutions. The results are summarized

in Table 4.4.

If we vary the mass and mixing parameters normally peaked at the best-

ﬁt value and 1σ error as the width then we ﬁnd solutions for smaller values

of m1(NH) and m3(IH). In this case for the textures with vanishing mee i.e.,

172

Chapter 4. Neutrino Mass Matrices

A class and E class we obtain correlations between the mixing angles sin2 θ14,
sin2 θ24, sin2 θ34 and the lowest mass scale m1. For these textures the eﬀective

mass responsible for neutrinoless double beta decay is zero. For the other allowed

textures we present the eﬀective mass measured in neutrinoless double beta de-

cay as a function of the smallest mass scale. If however, the known oscillation

parameters are varied randomly in their allowed 3σ range then although the

main conclusions deduced above regarding the allowed mass spectra in various

textures remain the same the allowed parameter space reduces in size. In partic-

ular, we obtain a bound on the lowest mass as mlowest > 0.01 eV and completely

hierarchical neutrinos are no longer allowed.

In Section 4.5 we have analyzed systematically the one-zero textures of the
4 × 4 mass matrix in presence of a sterile neutrino by varying all the oscilla-
tion parameters randomly in their allowed 3σ range. Assuming neutrinos to be

Majorana particles, this is a symmetric matrix with 10 independent entries. We
ﬁnd that |mee| = 0 is possible for NH only for higher values of the smallest mass
m1 while for IH it is possible even for lower values. This is in sharp contrast

with the 3 generation case where complete cancellation can never take place
for IH. |meµ| can vanish over the whole range of the smallest mass for both 3
and 3+1 neutrino scenarios. However for larger values of the mixing angle s2
24,

cancellation is not achieved for smaller m1 for NH. For IH the cancellation con-

dition depend on the Majorana phase α and the mixing angle θ24. Cancellation

is achieved for the element meτ for the full range of the lowest mass in the 3+1
scenario. The element meµ is related to the element meτ by µ − τ symmetry.
For small values of θ24 we get θ24 = θ34 in these textures. Consequently the role

played by θ24 for meµ is played by θ34 in meτ in this limit. Thus in this case

cancellation is not achieved for larger values of s2

34 in the hierarchical regime
for NH. For IH we obtain correlations between α and sin2 θ34 for fulﬁlling the
condition for cancellations. The elements mµµ and mτ τ are related by µ − τ
symmetry. For these cases, cancellation is not possible in the hierarchical zone

for IH, in the 3 generation case. However the extra contribution coming from

the sterile part helps in achieving cancellation in this region. For IH one can

173

obtain correlations between the Majorana phase α and the mixing angle θ24(θ34)
for |mµµ| = 0(|mτ τ| = 0). For mµτ element cancellation was possible for three
generation case only for higher values of the lightest mass. However if one in-

cludes the sterile neutrino then this element can vanish over the whole range of

the lightest neutrino mass considered. With the current constraints on sterile

parameters it is not possible to obtain mss = 0 while mes and mµs can only

vanish in the QD regime of the active neutrinos. However, the element mτ s can

be vanishingly small in the whole mass range.

Chapter 5

Conclusion: Present Aspects and

Future Prospects

In this thesis, we have focused on two very important areas of current research

in neutrino physics. In the ﬁrst part of our work, we have studied the potential

of the present/future generation neutrino oscillation experiments to determine

the remaining unknowns of neutrino oscillation parameters namely: the neutrino

mass hierarchy, the octant of θ23 and the leptonic CP phase δCP . The prospective

experiments to study these parameters that have been considered in this thesis

are: the accelerator based current generation long-baseline (LBL) experiments

T2K and NOνA, the future generation proposed LBL experiments LBNO and

LBNE, the future atmospheric experiment ICAL@INO and the ongoing ultra

high energy neutrino experiment IceCube. First we have analysed the CP sensi-

tivity of T2K, NOνA and ICAL. It is found that due to the presence of parameter

degeneracies, the current generation long baseline experiments T2K and NOνA

have CP sensitivity only in a limited region of the parameter space. With the

precise measurement of θ13, two types of degeneracies namely the hierarchy-δCP

degeneracy and octant-δCP degeneracy need to be considered. This gives rise to

wrong hierarchy and wrong octant solutions. The nature of hierarchy-δCP degen-

eracy is same for both neutrinos and antineutrinos but octant-δCP degeneracy

behaves diﬀerently in these two cases. Due to this reason, the wrong octant so-

lutions can be largely resolved by a balanced neutrino-antineutrino run of these

175

176

Chapter 5. Conclusion: Present Aspects and Future Prospects

experiments but the wrong hierarchy solutions can not be resolved by using data

from T2K/NOνA alone. This aﬀects the CP sensitivity since the wrong hier-

archy solution gets preference over the true solution. To solve this problem,

we suggested that in this case adding data from atmospheric neutrino experi-

ments can help. Taking ICAL@INO as the representative detector, we showed

that the atmospheric neutrino data can be instrumental in removing the wrong

hierarchy solutions of T2K/NOνA giving an improved CP sensitivity for these

experiments. We ﬁnd that with the projected exposures of T2K and NOνA i.e.,
an exposure corresponding to 8 × 1021 POT for T2K and 3 years running of
NOνA in both neutrino and antineutrino mode gives 2σ CP violation (CPV)

discovery sensitivity for only 24% true δCP values for θtr

µµ = 39◦, sin2 2θ13 = 0.1
and true NH. But with the addition of 10 yr (500 kt yr) of ICAL data, 2σ CPV

discovery can be achieved for 58% of true δCP values. Note that CP sensitivity

of ICAL is washed out because of the angular smearing but due to large earth

matter eﬀects and it has good hierarchy sensitivity which is independent of δCP .

These results are very important because, if nature has chosen such unfavor-

able combinations of parameters, then it is the addition of atmospheric neutrino

data to T2K+NOνA which may give us the ﬁrst signal of CP violation. Next

we have done a chronological study of δCP taking diﬀerent exposures of these

setups. We found that the CP sensitivity of T2K(3+2) (which implies 3 years

of running in neutrino mode and 2 years of running in antineutrino mode) is

better than T2K(5+0) but with the addition of NOνA(3+3) data, T2K(5+0)

and T2K(3+2) gives similar CP sensitivity. We also go beyond the projected

exposure of these experiments to assess the eﬀect of enhanced statistics. We

ﬁnd that, with the combination of T2K(5+5)+NOνA(5+5)+ICAL(500 kt yr),

it is possible to have 2σ (3σ) CPV discovery sensitivity for 62% (36%) of the

total δCP values for θtr

µµ = 39◦, sin2 2θ13 = 0.1 and true NH. In our study we
also show that if hierarchy is unknown then T2K(5+5) gives better CP sensi-

tivity than NOνA(5+5). Our results show that the current best-ﬁt of θ13 lies in

a region where the CP sensitivity is maximum for these experiments. We also

found that for T2K(5+0)+NOνA(5+5), there are wrong octant solutions in the

177

region 40◦ < θµµ < 49◦ when hierarchy is known. Due to addition of 10 years

of ICAL data, this range is restricted to 41◦ < θµµ < 48◦. We note that the

results discussed in this part of the thesis can be of importance and interest to

other atmospheric and/or reactor experiments sensitive to the mass hierarchy

and can initiate similar studies. These results have valuable ramiﬁcations for

current experiments.

Though the addition of ICAL data improves the CP sensitivity of T2K/NOνA

largely, from our results we see that these current generation experiments are ca-

pable of measuring δCP only up to 2σ to 3σ with their projected exposures. The

conclusions are also similar for the case of determination of hierarchy and oc-

tant.

In [154] it was shown that even an optimistic exposure of T2K+NOνA

can only resolve hierarchy at 90% C.L. In [147] it was shown that a combination

of T2K and NOνA can resolve octant for sin2 θ23 < 0.43 or > 0.58 only at 2σ.

The sensitivities of T2K/NOνA are limited because of their comparative shorter

baseline (< 1000 km) and less statistics. These experiments are also not sensitive

to the second oscillation maximum because of their narrow band beam proﬁle.

Thus to determine the unknown oscillation parameters at a greater conﬁdence

level, one needs to explore neutrino oscillations at longer baselines with large

number of event samples. The proposed LBL experiments LBNO and LBNE

are the examples of such initiatives. They will also have wide band ﬂux to ex-

plore the sensitivity coming from the second oscillation maximum. As the exact

conﬁgurations of these experiments are not decided yet, a comprehensive study

to estimate their sensitivities are extremely important.

In our work we have

studied how the results from T2K, NOνA and ICAL can economise the conﬁg-

urations of LBNO and LBNE. We ﬁnd that the required adequate exposure of

these experiments in establishing mass hierarchy/true octant at 5σ and discover-

ing CP violation at 3σ can be reduced signiﬁcantly by using data of these three

experiments. For LBNO, among the several proposed baselines, we have con-

sidered the following three baselines in our study: CERN-Pyh¨asalmi (2290 km),

CERN-Slanic (1500 km) and CERN-Fr´ejus (130 km). We have shown that ICAL

data helps remarkably in reducing the required exposures of these experiments

178

Chapter 5. Conclusion: Present Aspects and Future Prospects

in determining hierarchy and octant for a given C.L. For the baseline 130 km,

the matter eﬀect is not suﬃcient to break the degeneracy and ICAL data in this

case is even more useful. We have found that for the baselines 2290 km and 1500

km, ICAL data has no role to play in the determination of δCP . This conclusion

is also same for LBNE. This is because, the matter eﬀect in these baselines are

suﬃcient enough to break the hierarchy-δCP degeneracy that occurs for relatively

short baseline experiments T2K/NOνA and thus for these experiments there are

no wrong hierarchy solutions in the unfavourable half planes. As ICAL has no

CP sensitivity of its own, addition of ICAL data in this case does not play any

role. For LBNE, we have also examined the role of a near detector, eﬀect of

the second oscillation maximum and the contribution from antineutrinos. We

ﬁnd that with the inclusion of a near detector there is a signiﬁcant reduction in

the systematic errors as compared to the only far detector case and the second

oscillation maximum plays a non-trivial role in the mass hierarchy sensitivity.

The antineutrino data in LBNE helps in resolving the octant degeneracy and the

combined synergy between neutrino and antineutrino runs improve the octant

and CP sensitivity. The adequate exposures calculated in our studies can be

attained by various combinations of beam power, runtime and detector mass.

These minimal values can be used to set up the ﬁrst phase of LBNO/LBNE, if

an incremental/staged approach is being followed. Our studies show that the

synergies between the existing and upcoming LBL and atmospheric experiments

can play an important role and should be taken into consideration in planning

economised future facilities.

Apart from studying the physics potential of the long-baseline and atmo-

spheric neutrinos in determining unknown oscillation parameters, in this thesis

we have also studied how the oscillation of ultra high energy neutrinos depend on

the leptonic CP phase δCP . For this we have used the recently detected PeV neu-

trino events at IceCube. As mentioned Section 3.5, these high energy neutrinos

can originate in extragalactic sources via one of these three processes: πS, µDS

and nS. As these extragalactic neutrinos travel a long distance in vacuum, these

oscillations can be described by the averaged vacuum oscillation and thus they

179

provide an interesting opportunity to measure δCP independent of hierarchy-δCP

degeneracy. We ﬁnd that, in this scenario the result depends strongly on the

initial sources of these neutrinos. For πS and µDS source the best-ﬁt value

of δCP occurs at 0◦ and for nS source the best-ﬁt is 180◦. In this context we

have also tried to constrain the astrophysical sources taking the eﬀect of back-

grounds. Our results are important in the sense that if δCP is measured by other

LBL/atmospheric experiments, then IceCube data can be used to determine the

production mechanism of these neutrinos. Similar analyses can also be carried

out for other parameters/scenarios related to neutrino physics and astrophysics.

In the second part of our work we have studied the neutrino mass matrix

in terms of texture zeros in presence of one extra light sterile neutrino (3+1

scenario). Texture zeros constitute an important aspect in the study of the neu-

trino mass matrix. In general the low energy neutrino mass matrix depends on

oscillation parameters and masses. As all of them have not been measured in

the experiments, it is impossible to fully determine the neutrino mass matrix.

Texture zeros imply that some elements of the neutrino mass matrix are smaller

than the other elements. In our work, we have studied two-zero and one-zero tex-

tures in 3+1 scenario and compared our results with that of the three generation

case. For three generation it is well known that there are 15 possible two-zero

textures and among them only 7 are phenomenologically allowed. But in 3+1

case, there are 45 possibilities. We ﬁnd that among 45 only 15 are allowed and

remarkably these 15 correspond to the possible 15 two-zero texture cases that

arise for the low energy neutrino mass matrix in three generation. So the dis-

allowed textures in the 3 generation case become allowed by including an extra

sterile neutrino. For one-zero textures we ﬁnd that the correlations among the

various oscillation parameters are diﬀerent as compared to the 3 generation case.

The most remarkable contrast with the 3 generation results is the prediction for

the element mee which is the eﬀective mass governing neutrinoless double beta

decay (0νββ). At present there are bounds on this element from various ongoing

experiments. Future experiments can lower this bound and probe the IH region.

For three generation mee could vanish only in NH but in 3+1 case it can vanish

180

Chapter 5. Conclusion: Present Aspects and Future Prospects

for both NH and IH. Thus if the existence of sterile neutrinos is conﬁrmed by

future experiments then it may be diﬃcult to probe the hierarchy from 0νββ

alone. These results can be useful in probing underlying ﬂavour symmetries and

also for obtaining textures of Yukawa matrices in presence of light sterile neutri-

nos. These are also useful for building models for light sterile neutrinos and shed

light on the underlying new physics if future experiments and analysis reconﬁrm

the explanation of the present anomalies in terms of sterile neutrinos.

Appendix A

Expressions for Neutrino Oscilla-

tion Probabilities

In this appendix we will provide the expressions for oscillation probabilities for

three generations of neutrinos. In view of the current experimental scenario, the

most important channels are : the electron disappearance channel Pee, the muon

appearance channel Peµ and muon disappearance channel Pµµ. The accelerator

based long-baseline experiments will mainly use the Pµe

1 channel for determining

hierarchy, octant and δCP and the Pµµ channel for the precision measurement of
θ23 and |∆31|. For atmospheric neutrino experiments (like ICAL), the main
sensitivity comes form Pµµ channel whereas the rector experiments are sensitive

to the Pee channel. In the following subsections, ﬁrst we will give the expressions

for the above mentioned channels for OMSD approximation. Next we will give
the corresponding expressions for the α − s13 approximation. Then we write
down the same set of expressions for vacuum by putting the matter term zero in
the α − s13 approximation.

A.1 Expressions for OMSD Approximation

In the OMSD approximation, the smaller mass squared diﬀerence ∆21 is neglected

as compared to ∆31. Under this approximation, the eﬀect of θ12 and δCP also

Appendix B

Calculation of Events and χ2 Anal-

ysis

In this appendix we will discuss the method of χ2 analysis in detail. Let us

ﬁrst consider a superbeam experiment where muon neutrinos are produced at

the source. In the detector one gets electron and muon events1 governed by the

neutrino oscillation probability Pµe and survival probability Pµµ. The number of

oscillated electron events at the detector contain the contribution of the appear-

ance channel Pµe(x) which is a function of oscillation parameters x. If we will

denote the νµ ﬂux at the detector as Φµ, then the number of electron neutrinos

at the detector can be written as

Ne = ΦµPµe(x)σeǫ,

(B.1)

where σe is the cross section of the electron neutrinos and ǫ is the detector

eﬃciency. Let us discuss how are electron events are generated on the detector. In

the detector, neutrinos undergo charge current interactions to produce electrons.

νe + n → p + e−.

The signal produced by that electron is considered as the signature of the detected

neutrino and this is called an ‘event’. In this case the true energy of the neutrinos

1These muon neutrinos will also oscillate to tau neutrinos but the current superbeam ex-

periments are not sensitive to them.

Et is reconstructed from the measured energy Em and the expression for total

number of events (which is a function of Em) can be obtained by

Ne(Em) = Z Φµ(Et)Pµe(x, Et)R(Et, Em)σe(Et)ǫdEt,

(B.2)

where R(Et, Em) is the Gaussian resolution (smearing) function, which gives the

spread of Em for a given Et and can be written as

R(Et, Em) = C1exp(cid:20) −

(Et − Em)2

2σ2
E

(cid:21),

with normalisation coeﬃcient C1 and

σE = αE + β√E + γ.

(B.3)

(B.4)

The values of α, β and γ are diﬀerent for diﬀerent detectors. To incorporate the

energy dependence of the oscillation probability, we divide the total measured

energy range into several bins and the events in the ith bin is given by

(Ne)i = Z Z Φµ(Et)Pµe(x, Et)R(Et, Em)σe(Et)ǫdEtdEm.

(B.5)

The above expression is for the superbeam experiments. Now let us brieﬂy discuss

about the atmospheric experiments. As atmospheric neutrino ﬂux consists of

both νe and νµ, the electron events at the detector get contribution from both

Pµe and Pee channels. In this case the ﬂux and the oscillation probabilities are

also functions of the direction of the incoming neutrinos i.e., the zenith angle θ.

Thus the events rates for atmospheric neutrinos in ith energy bin and jth zenith

angle bin can be expressed as

(Ne)ij = Z Z Z Z [Φµ(Et, Ωt)Pµe(x, Et, Ωt) + Φe(Et, Ωt)Pee(x, Et, Ωt)] R(Et, Em)

× R(Ωt, Ωm)σe(Et)ǫdEtdEmdΩtdΩm,

(B.6)

where Φe is the νe ﬂux at the detector. The angular smearing function R(Ωt, Ωm)

given by,

R(Ωt, Ωm) = C2exp(cid:20)(θt − θm)2 + sin2 θt(φt − φm)2

2σ2
Ω

(cid:21),

(B.7)

where C2 is the normalisation constant and φ is the azimuthal angle.

After calculating the event rates, the statistical χ2 for each energy bin (for

the case of accelerator experiment) can be obtained by either using the Gaussian

187

formula i.e.,

χ2

stat = Xi

i − (Ne)exp
(Ne)exp

,

or by using the Poisson formula 2 i.e.,

χ2

stat = Xi

i − (Ne)exp

i − (Ne)exp

i

log(cid:18) (Ne)th
i
(Ne)exp

i (cid:19)(cid:21).

(B.8)

(B.9)

After calculating the statistical χ2, we need to incorporate the systematic

errors in the experiments which can arise from the uncertainties in the neutrino

ﬂux, cross-sections, direction of the neutrino etc. In our analysis we have included

the eﬀect of systematics by the method of pull [177, 178] in the following way.

Suppose we want to incorporate a 5% overall normalisation error in our analysis.

For this we modify the events N th

i as (in the linearised approximation)

N th
i → N th

i (1 + 0.05ξ),

(B.10)

where ξ is called the pull variable. After modifying the events, the combined

statistical and systematic χ2 is given by

χ2
stat+sys = χ2

stat + ξ2,

(B.11)

where the ξ2 term is due to penalty for deviating N th
i

from its mean value. Up

to now we have implemented only one source of systematics. For k number of

sources of systematics, Eqn. B.10 and B.11 becomes

N th
i → N th

stat+sys = χ2

i (cid:18)1 +Xk
stat +Xk

k.

ck

i ξk(cid:19),

(B.12)

(B.13)

Finally χ2

pull is obtained by varying ξk from −3 to +3, corresponding to their 3σ

ranges and minimising over ξk

2If the events per bin are very small (< 5) then one should use the Poisson formula.

χ2

pull = min{ξk}(cid:2)χ2

stat+sys(cid:3).

(B.14)

188

Chapter B. Calculation of Events and χ2 Analysis

Now let us discuss the marginalisation procedure. The χ2
i and N exp

a particular set of oscillation parameters in N th

i

pull deﬁned above is for

. To incorporate the

uncertainties in the oscillation parameters in our analysis, we calculate χ2 by

varying all the oscillation parameters in their 3σ range in the test events and

then minimise the resultant χ2 with respect to this test parameter set:

χ2 = min{xth}(cid:2)χ2

pull + χ2

prior(cid:3),

(B.15)

where χ2

prior is the penalty for deviating the oscillation parameters from their true

values. In principle, we should add a prior term for each oscillation parameters.

But in our analysis we have added prior only for θ13 in the form

χ2

prior = (cid:18) sin2 2θexp

13 − sin2 2θth
σ(sin2 2θ13)

13

(cid:19)2

.

(B.16)

In our analysis of the long-baseline and atmospheric neutrino experiments,

we have not varied the solar parameters as they are already measured very pre-

cisely. For the atmospheric parameters we did not add any prior because, in all

our analysis we have considered measurements from disappearance channel and

disappearance channel is itself capable of measuring the atmospheric parameters

θ23 and ∆31

3.

To determine the combined sensitivity of diﬀerent experiments, χ2

pull for each

experiment is calculated corresponding to a given test parameter value. Then

the resultant χ2

pull’s are added and minimised over the test parameter set after

adding the priors.

3However for the our analysis of the ultra high energy neutrinos we have taken priors for

all the three mixing angles.

Appendix C

Extraction of the Sterile Mixing

Parameters

In this appendix we explain the extractions of the sterile mixing parameters from

the global ﬁt results of the short-baseline (SBL) neutrino oscillation experiments.

In the 3+1 scenario (three active neutrinos, one sterile neutrino), the mixing

matrix U can be parametrised as

U = R34 ˜R24 ˜R14R23 ˜R13R12,

(C.1)

where Rij denotes rotation matrices in the ij generation space and is expressed

as,

R34=





1

0

0

0

0



with sij = sin θij and cij = cos θij. In this case there are three new mixing angles

θ14, θ24 and θ34 and three Dirac type phases δ13, δ14 and δ24 which describe the

oscillations of the sterile neutrinos. The explicit forms of the Uα4 (α = e, µ and

τ ) elements under this parametrisation are given by

Ue4 = eiδ14s14,

Uµ4 = eiδ24c14s24,

Uτ 4 = c14c24s34.

Chapter C. Extraction of the Sterile Mixing Parameters

In 3+1 scheme the eﬀective transition and survival probabilities relevant for

the SBL experiments are given by

4E (cid:19) ,
Pαβ = sin2 2θαβ sin2(cid:18) ∆41L
Pαα = sin2 2θαα sin2(cid:18)∆41L
4E (cid:19) ,

where ∆41 = m2

4 − m2

1, with

sin2 2θαβ = 4|Uα4|2|Uβ4|2,
sin2 2θαα = 4|Uα4|2(cid:0)1 − |Uα4|2(cid:1) .

(C.5)

(C.6)

(C.7)

(C.8)

The reactor experiments Bugey [60], ROVNO [56] and Gosgen [58] give bound
in the sin2 2θee − ∆41 plane via electron disappearance channel measurement.
The bound for sin2 2θµµ and ∆41 comes from the νµ disappearance channel mea-

surements of CDHSW [260] and the atmospheric neutrinos [253]. The experi-

ments LSND [49], MiniBooNE [102], NOMAD [261] and KARMEN [262] give

constraints on sin2 2θµe and ∆41 from the νe appearance channel.

The global analysis of the data from all these experiments give constraints
on |Ue4|2 and |Uµ4|2 [253] from which one can calculate θ14 and θ24. The mixing
angle θ34 is constrained from the MINOS neutral current (NC) data [263]. It is

important to note that the SBL data do not give any constraint on the phases.
