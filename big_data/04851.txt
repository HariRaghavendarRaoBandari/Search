Inspired by the string axiverse idea, it has been suggested that the recent transition from de-
celerated to accelerated cosmic expansion is driven by an axion-like quintessence ﬁeld with a sub-
Planckian decay constant. The scenario requires that the axion ﬁeld be rather near the maximum
of its potential, but is less ﬁnely tuned than other explanations of cosmic acceleration. The model
is parametrized by an axion decay constant f , the axion mass m, and an initial misalignment angle
|θi| which is close to π. In order to determine the m and θi values consistent with observations,
these parameters are mapped onto observables: the Hubble parameter H(z) at and angular diameter
distance dA(z) to redshift z = 0.57, as well as the angular sound horizon of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). Measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale at z (cid:39) 0.57 by
the BOSS survey and Planck measurements of CMB temperature anisotropies are then used to
probe the {m, f, θi} parameter space. With current data, CMB constraints are the most powerful,
allowing a fraction of only ∼ 0.2 of the parameter-space volume. Measurements of the BAO scale
made using the SPHEREx or SKA experiments could go further, observationally distinguishing all
but ∼ 10−2 or ∼ 10−5 of the parameter-space volume (allowed by simple priors) from the ΛCDM
model.

INTRODUCTION

The cause of the accelerated cosmic expansion [1, 2]
remains elusive. One possibility is quintessence, in which
the acceleration is driven by the potential energy of a
scalar ﬁeld displaced from the minimum of its potential
[3–7]. Alternative-gravity solutions to cosmic accelera-
tion or models based upon large extra dimensions also
generally require some parameter to be tuned to be ex-
tremely small [8–10]. String-landscape [11] and/or an-
thropic arguments [12] explain the small value of the
cosmological constant by supposing a Universe with a
cosmological constant of this value just happens to be
the one, of ∼ 10120, that allows intelligent observers.
Quintessence models do not generically address the
“why now” problem; i.e., why the Universe transitions
from decelerated expansion to accelerated expansion only
fairly recently, after the Universe has cooled 30 orders
of magnitude below the Planck temperature. They also
typically require a potential that is extremely ﬂat. This
latter problem may be solved [13, 14] if the quintessence
ﬁeld is an axion-like ﬁeld, in which case the shift sym-
metry of the axion potential protects the extraordinary
ﬂatness required of the quintessence potential.

This solution, though, still requires either that the ax-
ion decay constant have a super-Planckian value, some-
thing that violates the gravity-as-the-weakest force con-
jecture [15], or that the initial axion misalignment angle
is extremely close to the value π that maximizes the po-
tential. This latter option is considered unappealing as it
replaces the ﬁne-tuning of a cosmological constant with
the ﬁne tuning of some other parameter. The hypoth-
esis that quintessence is an axion-like ﬁeld also requires
that the dark-energy density today must still be put in
by hand.

In recent work [16], several of us suggested that some
of the remaining problems with axion-like quintessence
may be addressed in the string axiverse [17, 18]. String
theories may lead to a family of O(100) axion-like ﬁelds
with masses that span a huge number of decades.
In,
Ref. [16], a scenario was proposed in which these ax-
ions have masses that are distributed roughly evenly per
decade of axion mass. In this case, then in each decade
of the cosmic expansion, one of these axions becomes dy-
namical and has some small chance to drive an acceler-
ated expansion. This chance is determined by the initial
value, assumed to be selected at random, of the axion
misalignment angle. It was shown that with reasonable
parameter selections, there is a one in ∼100 chance that
the Universe will expand by ∼ 30 decades in scale fac-
tor before it undergoes accelerated expansion. The sce-
nario thus explains quintessence in terms of an axion-like
ﬁeld with dimensionless parameters that never diﬀer from
unity by more than an order of magnitude and also ad-
dresses the “why now” problem.

While the scenario may lead to a variety of observa-

tional consequences, the most basic prediction is that
dark energy is an axion-like quintessence ﬁeld with a de-
cay constant very close to, but just below, the Planck
mass. The purpose of this paper is to explore the obser-
vational consequences of this type of quintessence the-
ory, to impose constraints to the parameter space from
current measurements, and to forecast the sensitivity
of future measurements to the remaining regions of the
model parameter space. It is found that current cosmic
microwave-background measurements reduce the allowed
parameter space to a fraction ∼ 0.2 of the prior vol-
ume, while future measurements of the baryon acoustic-
oscillation scale by galaxy surveys could distinguish all
but a fraction of ∼ 10−5 of the parameter-space volume

(allowed by simple priors) from the ΛCDM model. On
the other hand, it is found that if constraints are pro-
jected onto the two-dimensional space of axion mass m
and initial misalignment angle θi, the sensitivity of fu-
ture experiments improves only modestly upon current
constraints, assuming that the correct underlying dark-
energy model is in fact the ﬁducial ΛCDM scenario.

We begin in Section II by introducing the axiverse in-
spired quintessence model that is the focus of this paper.
In Section III we obtain the relevant equations of motion,
and discuss the resulting expansion histories.
In Sec-
tion IV, we identify axion model parameter choices that
give appropriate values of the dark energy density today.
In Section V, we explore the probability distribution of
dark energy density ΩDE and present-day equation-of-
state parameter w under ﬂat priors for the axion mass m
(in units of H0) and initial axion displacement δ = π−θi.
In Section VI, we obtain constraints on m and δ for diﬀer-
ent values of the dimensionless Peccei-Quinn energy scale
α = f /Mpl using measurements of the cosmic expansion
history from the baryon acoustic oscillation scale and the
CMB. We conclude in Section VII. In Appendix A, we
discuss in detail our treatment of CMB anisotropies in
axiverse-inspired quintessence models.

II. MODEL

The scenario we consider is one in which cosmic accel-
eration is due to the slow rolling of a quintessence ﬁeld
φ down toward the minimum of its potential V (φ). The
standard axion-like potential is

V (φ) = Λ4 [1 − cos(φ/f )] ,

(1)

where f is the axion decay constant, and Λ4 is a vacuum-
energy density comparable to the dark-energy density
today. Below we refer to this standard axion model as
Model A. As noted in Ref. [16], in this scenario, the many
axions with mass m (cid:38) 10−17 eV (which do not contribute
to dark energy today) might dominate the energy density
of the universe, overclosing it in the process. One way
around this problem is to invoke the decay of such axions
into standard-model particles. Another is to consider a

diﬀerent potential:

V (φ) = Λ4 [1 − cos(φ/f )]3 .

2

(2)

We refer to this potential as Model B; it has the added
advantage that after beginning to coherently oscillate,
higher mass axions become energetically subdominant,
leaving the standard cosmological expansion history in
place (up to the time evolution of lighter axion ﬁelds,
which contribute to the dark energy). In either case, the
ﬁeld φ takes on values −π ≤ (φ/f ) ≤ π. We also deﬁne
the axion mass to be m = Λ2/f , although the ﬁeld in
the latter potential is in fact massless. We deﬁne the
misalignment angle to be θ ≡ φ/f and often use it as
a proxy for φ. The model is also speciﬁed by an initial
misalignment angle |θi| which, as we will see, must be
very close to π. We thus deﬁne δi ≡ π − |θi|. The time
derivative of θ is assumed to be zero at time t = 0. For
reasons discussed in Ref. [16] (and as will be seen below),
the decay constant can be written as f = αMp, where

Mp = (8πG)−1/2 = 2.43×1018 GeV is the reduced Planck
mass, with values α ∼ 0.1 − 1.
In summary, the model is parametrized (for either po-
tential) by three quantities, which we take to be (1) the
axion mass parameter m, (2) the decay-constant param-
eter α, and (3) the initial displacement δi of the misalign-
ment angle.

III. DYNAMICS

The evolution of the ﬁeld is determined by its equation

of motion,

¨φ + 3H ˙φ + V

(cid:48)

(φ) = 0,

(3)

where the dot denotes a derivative with respect to time
and the prime a derivative with respect to φ. The Hubble
rate H is given by the Friedmann equation,

H =

where a is the cosmological scale factor. Here, ρm(r) is
the matter (radiation) density and the energy density of
the axion is given by,

ρφ =

˙φ2 + V (φ).

(5)

The pressure pφ is given by the same equation but an al-
ternate sign in front V . The equation-of-state parameter
for this quintessence ﬁeld is given by,

w = pφ/ρφ.

(6)

The dependence with redshift z is ρm(z) = Ωmρc,0(1+z)3
and ρr(z) = Ωrρc,0(1 + z)4 where z is related to the scale
factor by a = 1/(1 + z). The radiation energy-density
ρr(z) includes the contribution of photons and massless

the temperature T is comparable to the neutrino mass mν

sions for a Fermi-Dirac distribution (e.g. Refs. [19, 20]).

It is then convenient to introduce the density pa-
rameters Ωi ≡ ρi/ρc where ρc is the critical energy
density with present-day value ρc,0 = 3H 2

H0 = 100 h km/s/Mpc, where we assume the best-ﬁt
Planck ΛCDM values for the dimensionless Hubble con-
stant h = 0.67 [21].

Assuming that the dark matter density and the energy
density in the quintessence ﬁeld are unrelated quantities,
we ﬁx the matter content to the CMB-inferred physical
baryon and cold dark matter densities using the “Planck

TT + lowP” values of Tab. 3 of Ref. [21], Ωbh2 = 0.02222
and Ωcdmh2 = 0.1197, respectively; Ωm = Ωb + Ωcdm.1

Finally, we further assume a ﬂat Universe and a present

day photon temperature T0 = T (z = 0) = 2.726 K [21].

The equations of motion (3) together with the scale
factor a are integrated numerically. We show the scalar
ﬁeld value φ using its instantaneous displacement from
its maximum-energy value, given by the variable δ ≡
π − φ/f . We use a high initial redshift zs = few × 1000
whose precise value is numerically inconsequential, but
suﬃciently large that the quintessence energy density is

where t0 is the cosmic time today (at redshift z = 0). The
lines in the bottom row of Fig. 1 show dA normalized to
the angular diameter distance of a ﬂat ΛCDM Universe
with constant ΩΛ = 0.685 [22].

The scenarios depicted by the thick line are visually
indistinguishable from ΛCDM, and as we shall see in
Secs. VI and Appendix A, are consistent with obser-
vational constraints. At the δ values shown, for lower α
values or higher m values, ﬁeld evolution is fast enough
to distinguish by eye from ΛCDM. The deviation of H(z)
and dA(z) hint that observations sensitive to the cosmo-
logical expansion rate and speciﬁc angular-diameter dis-
tances (like measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations
and CMB anisotropies) will test the axiverse-inspired
quintessence model. For axion masses m (cid:38) 10H0, the
ﬁeld rolls quickly enough to enter the oscillatory regime
(unless δ is ﬁnely tuned), spoiling the utility of the axion
as a dark-energy candidate, as we see more quantitatively
in Secs. VI-A.

IV. CONDITIONS FOR DARK ENERGY

The ﬁrst issue we address is the range of values of
δi that give rise to dark-energy domination today. We
In Ref. [16], it
begin with a rough analytic argument.
was argued that w (cid:46) −1/3 is achieved if the slow-roll
p /2)(V (cid:48)/V )2 (cid:46) 1 is satisﬁed. Writ-
condition  = (M 2
ing V (θ) = Λ4U (θ), for U (θ) = 1 − cos θ, this suggests
that w ≤ −1/3 will be achieved if δ = π − |θ| (cid:46) 2√2α,
or δ (cid:46) α; for U (θ) = (1 − cos θ)3, this is amended to
δ (cid:46) α/3. However, evolution of the ﬁeld from the intial
time z (cid:29) 1 to the redshifts z ∼ 1 at which dark-energy
domination begins implies that the value of δ at z ∼ 1 is
not necessarily the same as the initial value δi at z (cid:29) 1.
This evolution becomes signiﬁcant for m (cid:38) H0, and
thus indicates a quintessence ﬁeld that begins to roll be-
fore the present day.

These arguments can be made more quantitative. We
numerically evolve Eqs. (3) and (4), using the values
α = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4. We determine a range of values
for the dimensionless axion mass m/H0 by imposing the

condition 0.6 ≤ Ωφ ≤ 0.7 under the no-roll approxima-
tion. We then use the numerical solutions to determine
the maximum initial value δmax
of the ﬁeld displacement
needed to satisfy the constraint −1 ≤ w ≤ −0.7. The
results are shown in Table I. The results are relevant for
the string-axiverse scenario described in Ref. [16]. There
it was argued that the fraction of the −π ≤ θi ≤ π range
for the initial misalignment angle that would give rise
to cosmic acceleration was ∼ α. This ansatz then led,
through further rough calculations, to an estimate for
the ∼ 0.001 − 0.01 probability that, for α ∼ 0.1 − 1, a
given Universe would have a dark-energy density like that
we observe. That estimate, though, neglected the early
evolution of the scalar ﬁeld. We now see, with our more
precise calculation, that the real probability drops several
orders of magnitude below ∼ α for α (cid:46) 0.1 (for Model
A) and for α (cid:46) 0.2 (for Model B). We thus conclude that
the string-axiverse solution to the “why now” problem
described in Ref. [16] requires α (cid:38) 0.1 for Model A and
α (cid:38) 0.2 for Model B.
Our numerical results for 0.1 (cid:46) α (cid:46) 0.4 also suggest
that for these allowable ranges of α, the probability that
a given Universe has a dark-energy density like that we
observe (parameterized by the allowed range of δ) is re-
duced by roughly an order of magnitude relative to the
estimates given in Ref. [16]. Of course the conditions
0.6 ≤ Ωφ ≤ 0.7 and −1 ≤ w ≤ −0.7 (which describe
the properties of dark energy today) only crudely ap-
proximate the precise observational constraints to dark
energy from actual data (like the galaxy correlation func-
tion and CMB power spectra), which are more precisely
evaluated in Sec. VI and Appendix A. For now, we move
on to make predictions for cosmological observables using
the parameter-space regions identiﬁed in Table I.

V. PREDICTIONS FOR QUINTESSENCE

OBSERVABLES

Suppose now that dark energy is indeed a quintessence
ﬁeld of the form we consider here. The string-axiverse
motivation requires, as we just learned, α (cid:38) 0.1. An
obvious question is what histories w(z), H(z), and dA(z)
are predicted by the parameter values roughly consistent

with this scenario for quintessence, especially in light of
the fact that a whole suite of recent/ongoing cosmological
measurements [23–26] target observables related to the
recent history of these variables. We now address this
question.

In order to address this question, we ﬁx a value of α
and then assume that models are distributed uniformly
in axion mass m and uniformly in the initial misalign-
ment angle δi, i.e., the joint probability distribution of
models in the m-δi space is ∂2N/∂m∂δi =constant. In
certain regions of parameter space there exists a one-to-
one mapping of the (m, δi) parameter space to (w, Ωde),
where Ωde ≡ Ωφ.
The distribution of models in the (w, Ωde) parameter
space is then given by the Jacobian of the transforma-
tion, i.e., ∂2N/∂w∂Ωde ∝ ∂(m, δi)/∂(w, Ωde), which we
obtain numerically. The probability distribution function
(PDF) p(w) that arises for w, given a family of models
uniformly distributed in m and δi is then,

p(w) =

dΩde

(cid:90)

where we begin from a number of N prospective dark en-
ergy solutions (δi, m) that satisfy the restrictions 0.6 ≤
ΩDE ≤ 0.7 and w(z = 0) ≤ −0.7 following Sec. IV.
The expression for p(Ωde) is obtained by the replacement
Ωde ↔ w in (8). We also wish to infer the PDF of other
quantities, such as distance measures dA at z = 1 or
zdec (cid:39) 1090 (where zdec is the redshift of decoupling).
Starting from the same set of generated dark energy so-
lutions, the PDF of an observable y(δi, m) is numerically
straightforward to obtain by generalizing Eq. (8).

In the top row of Fig. 2 we show the PDFs for w at
redshift z = 0 that arise for both models A and B for
several diﬀerent values of α. The results indicate that
the distribution in w covers all values relatively evenly,
but with an increase as w → −1 which is due to an
integrable square-root singularity at w → −1. The gray
lines shows the cumulative probability distribution (×10)
for α = 0.3 that quantiﬁes the probability of having w
near −1 among the dark energy candidates; for exam-
ple, p(w ≤ −0.95) ∼ 40%. We thus conclude that if the
empirically allowed window for w continues to converge
to an ever smaller range around w = −1, the string ax-
iverse scenario becomes less attractive in the sense that
the scenario does not uniquely predict that w (cid:54)= −1.
The second row of Fig. 2 shows the PDFs for Ωde.
They are ﬂat, and do not favor a particular value of
Ωde. Some qualitative understanding might be gained
as follows: for a given α, all dark energy candidate solu-
tions have approximately the same mass m that is small
enough that little evolution of the ﬁeld has yet occurred,
but big enough to yield 0.6 ≤ Ωde ≤ 0.7. For example,
in Model A and in the limit of neglecting the ﬁeld evo-
lution altogether, the energy density is proportional to
i /2)m2α2. For constant m and α, ρφ is hence
ρφ ∝ (2− δ2
distributed as 1/√ρφ (the PDF of δ2
i ) and a relatively
ﬂat distribution is not surprising. If δ and m are both

5

drawn from a uniform distribution, ρφ still has a rela-

tively ﬂat distribution (∝ 1/√ρφ away from the edges

of the prior on δ and m). The same argument holds
roughly for Model B, although the ﬁeld evolution is more
dramatic for this scenario.

Ratios of the Hubble parameter H(z = 1) to ΛCDM
values are shown in Fig. 3, while the analogous plots
for dA(z = 1) are shown in the upper row of Fig. 4,
along with the equivalent plots for dA(zdec) in the lowest
row. Common to all PDFs is that they are clustered
around the ﬁducial ΛCDM case (by construction) and
deviate from it by no more than 2%. Such deviations
fall within the reach of completed surveys like BOSS [27]
and the projected sensitivities of galaxy redshift surveys
by WFIRST [28], SKA [29, 30], and SPHEREx [31]. In
the next section we explore this sensitivity and derive
constraints from existing observations.

VI. CONSTRAINTS FROM THE

BARYON-PHOTON SOUND HORIZON

In the analysis above, we roughly (and conservatively)
identiﬁed the dark energy parameter space as −1 ≤ w ≤
−0.7 and 0.6 ≤ Ωde ≤ 0.7, and derived predictions for
the distribution of prospective observables in that region.
The actual allowed region of parameter space, however,
can be constrained more precisely, using quantities [like
dA(z) and H(z)] which are more straightforwardly re-
lated to observables. When this is done, the allowed re-
gion in (w, Ωde) parameter space is not rectangular, as
we have approximated so far.

In this Section, we impose constraints to the model and
ﬁnd the implications for the {δ, m, α} parameter space
using precise cosmological data. We treat the ΛCDM cos-
mology with Planck ﬁducial values as our null hypothesis
[21] or ﬁducial cosmology. In particular, the cosmic sound
horizon at decoupling (of the baryon-photon plasma) sets
the scale of the BAO feature in the galaxy power spec-
trum, as well as the angular scale of the CMB acoustic
peaks. Below, we use both quantities to test the possi-
bility of axiverse-inspired quintessence models.

For example, given a parameter selection, the model
makes speciﬁc predictions for the time evolution of w
that can be constrained.
If there is no energy trans-
fer between the quintessence ﬁeld and another compo-
nent (as assumed in this work), energy conservation

In the simplest case, w = const, the right hand side re-
duces to (1 + z)3(1+w) and w = −1 corresponds to a
cosmological constant. We could impose constraints to
our axiverse-inspired quintessence models by determining
which δ, m, and α values are consistent with constraints
to w. This approach, however, neglects the (model-
dependent) dynamics of w and would lead to biases in the

quintessence candidates by the criteria of Sec. IV [i.e. 0.6 ≤ Ωde ≤ 0.7 and w(0) ≤ −0.7]. Results are shown for four diﬀerent
values of α. The gray lines show the cumulative probability distribution (×10) for α = 0.3 that quantiﬁes the probability of
having w near −1 among the dark energy candidates; for example, p(w ≤ −0.95) ∼ 40%. The string axiverse scenario becomes
less attractive in the sense that the scenario does not uniquely predict that w (cid:54)= −1.

results, as well as an underestimate of the error bars. One
could also consider a simple two-parameter model, with
w(z) = w0 + waz/(1 + z). Here wa = −2dw/d ln R|z=1
is a parameter that encodes the time dependence of the
quintessence ﬁeld [32], but this parameterization is not
accurate for dark energy models in general or axion mod-
els in particular.

Instead, we compute dA(z) and H(z) (which are more
directly related to survey observables) at various redshifts
for a grid of models in the {δ, m, α} parameter space
and compare with survey data. With the mapping of
vast volumes of our Universe, measurements of galaxy
clustering and the BAO feature embedded in them have

verse can be computed as the comoving sound horizon
cs(z)/H(z)dz (cid:39) 150 Mpc at the drag epoch
with redshift zd, not to be confused with the sound hori-
zon rdec at decoupling. By measuring the sound horizon
in the galaxy two-point correlation function, one can then
infer dA(z) and H(z) at low redshift z. Roughly speaking
(for details, see the detailed discussion of Refs.
[27, 37]
and references therein), galaxy separations along the line
of sight depend on H(z)rd (corresponding to diﬀerences
in redshift) and separations transverse to the line of sight
depend on dA(z)/rd (corresponding to diﬀerences in an-
gular position).

This quantity sets the angular scale of acoustic peaks in
the CMB acoustic peaks, and is one of the most precisely
measured numbers in cosmology.

By altering the late-time cosmic expansion history, ax-
ion dark energy will also change dA(zdec), the angular-
diameter distance to the surface of last scattering. This
will alter the angular scale of the CMB acoustic peaks,
yielding an additional CMB constraint to axion dark en-
ergy. For some model parameter values, the physical
sound horizon rdec at decoupling changes (very mod-
estly), altering the dependence of the angular acous-
tic scale on axion model parameters. As we show in
Appendix A, computing the eﬀect of axiverse-inspired
quintessence models on θ∗ is a very accurate (and much
faster) proxy for a full computation of CMB power spec-
tra, and can thus be eﬃciently used to infer CMB con-
straints to such models.

We now quantify the discriminating power of the var-
ious cosmological observables for the axiverse-inspired
models that satisfy the basic requirements w ≤ −0.7
and 0.6 ≤ Ωde ≤ 0.7. We obtain constraints from cur-
rent data, and then assess the sensitivity of future ex-
periments. Figure 5 shows histograms [probability dis-
tribution functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution
functions (CDFs)] of the predictions of the models and
how they fare in comparison to BOSS observed values of
dA and H at redshift z = 0.57 and to the Planck 2015
inferred angular scale of the sound horizon at decoupling.
For the central values and errors of the BAO observ-
ables we use measurements of the angular diameter dis-

dA(z = 0.57) = (1421 ± 20) Mpc × (rd/rd,ﬁd),
H(z = 0.57) = (96.8 ± 3.4)

Mpc × (rd,ﬁd/rd),

(11)

where rd,ﬁd = 149.28 Mpc [27] and rd = 147.43 Mpc for
our assumed ΛCDM ﬁducial model. For other models in
the axion parameter space rd takes on diﬀerent values
and we compute those self-consistently. We include the
covariance between these quantities [27] when determin-
ing if a given axion model is inside or outside the allowed
region at the observable level. For Planck, we are con-
servative and use the value

100θ∗ = 1.04105 ± 0.00046,

(12)

stated in Ref. [21], based on temperature data at all scales
and low-(cid:96) polarization data (as opposed to the full polar-
ization data set). For Model A, we swept the parameter
space on a logarithmic grid satisfying 0.001 ≤ δi ≤ 2 and
0.1 ≤ α ≤ 0.8, with 81 δi values and 31 α values. We
then obtain central m(δ, α) value for the axion mass by
demanding that Ωφ = 1 in the no-roll limit, which im-
plies that m/H0 = 1/α. We then deﬁne a scan range of
61 m values, linearly spaced with m/H0 = (m/H0)+0.6−0.4.
For Model B, the same density condition implies that
m/H0 = 1/(2α), with m/H0 = (m/H0) ± 0.3. Here we
use the range 10−6 ≤ δi ≤ 1, with the same number of
grid points as for Model A, in all dimensions. We check
that these values ensure a full sweep of the allowed pa-
rameter space.

FIG. 4. The PDF for the angular-diameter distance dA to redshift z = 1 that arises in a family of models uniformly distributed in
axion mass and initial misalignment angle which qualify as quintessence candidates by the criteria of Sec. IV [i.e. 0.6 ≤ Ωde ≤ 0.7
and w(0) ≤ −0.7]. Results are shown for four diﬀerent values of α.

We ran a full numerical integration of the equations of
motion [Eqs. (3) and (4)] for all 153, 171 models in this
grid and then compare the values of dA(z), H(z) and θ∗
with the BOSS and Planck conﬁdence regions described
above. We also ran this integration within a modiﬁed
version of the camb code, described in Appendix A, in
order to self consistently compute the (small) change in
θ∗ in our model that results from modiﬁed early-time
evolution of the (highly sub-dominant) dark-energy com-
ponent, including small corrections to the value of zdec.
We found that our results are insensitive to this correc-
tion.

Constraints from current measurements and predic-
tions of future sensitivity are shown in Fig. 5. For the du-
ration of this (parameter-space volume) discussion, dA(z)
are H(z) are treated simply, as uncorrelated independent

observables. Correlations are considered more carefully
below, when detailed parameter constraints to {δ, m, α}
are obtained.
For Model A (B), at the 1σ conﬁdence level, 70% (71%)
of the models (in our grid) consistent with dark-energy
priors are allowed by the dA(z = 0.57) measurement,
while only 1.4% (0.4%) of the models are allowed by the
H(z = 0.57) measurement. This is driven by the well
known 1σ tension between BOSS results and Planck ﬁdu-
cial ΛCDM values [27].

For Model A (B), at the 2σ conﬁdence level, 99%
(all) of the models consistent with the dark-energy prior
(−0.7 ≥ w ≥ −1 and 0.6 ≤ Ωφ ≤ 0.7) are allowed by the
dA(z = 0.57) measurement, while 89% (87%) of the mod-
els are consistent with the H(z = 0.57) measurement. Fi-
nally, CMB measurements are more discriminating. For

values stated in Eqs. (11)-(12). The left column shows results for Model A, while the right column shows results for Model B.
The top panel shows the PDF and only shows existing data (anisotropic BAO measurements from BOSS and CMB data from
Planck). The bottom row shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF), now both comparing models with current data as
in the ﬁrst row, but also with future experiments, assuming a ΛCDM ﬁducial model. Errors are smaller for future experiments,
leading to an outward dilation of the CDF (more models are ruled out with better data). In the second row, the light black
curve shows predicted results for dA(z = 0.57) with the SPHEREx experiment. The dotted black curve shows predicted
results for dA(z = 0.57) with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The light blue curve shows predicted results for H(z = 0.57)
with SPHEREx. The dotted blue curve shows predicted results for H(z = 0.57) with the SKA. The thin pink curve shows
predicted results for a cosmic-variance limited CMB polarization experiment with maximum multipole (cid:96)max = 2200, similar to
the CMB-S4 concept.

Model A (B), at the 2σ conﬁdence level, only 17% (18%)
of the models are consistent with Planck constraints.

In addition to the high precision BAO measurements at
z = 0.57 from galaxy clustering, there are BOSS Lyman-
α forest (LyaF) data that test the expansion history at

higher redshift as well. The latter data show a (2− 2.5)σ
tension with a CMB-supported standard cosmology, with
LyaF results favoring a lower Hubble rate and smaller an-
gular diameter distance at z = 2.34 [42]. It is worthwhile
to consider whether or not axiverse-inspired quintessence

ment with BAO data at z = 0.57. It turns out that they
cannot, as we obtain no data points (for Model A or B)
that agree with LyaF (Fig. 15 of Ref.
[42]) constraints
and measurements of dA(z = 0.57) and H(z = 0.57).
Of course this tension could be a statistical ﬂuke, or the
result of some unrecognized systematic error [42].

Assuming a ﬁducial Planck ΛCDM cosmology, we also
determine how future galaxy surveys could improve on
those constraints, by performing a standard Fisher fore-
cast [43] of the errors on the observed galaxy power spec-
trum (at z = 0.57) for the proposed SPHEREx satellite
[31] and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) [29, 30] (at
z = 1). These results are obtained from a standard BAO
forecast prescription [44] and are shown in the bottom
panel of Fig. 5.

For Model A and B, at the 2σ conﬁdence level, we see
that future dA(z = 0.57) measurements from SKA will be
comparably sensitive to current CMB constraints, poten-
tially distinguishing all but 15% of the parameter-space
volume (allowed by our prior) from the ΛCDM model.
The next major improvement in sensitivity will come
from SPHEREx constraints to H(z = 0.57), which for
Model A (B) will distinguish all but 1% (0.2%) of the
parameter-space volume (allowed by our prior) from the
ΛCDM model.

A future cosmic-variance limited CMB experiment
(like CMB Stage-4 [45]) with Fisher-level sensitivity of

∆θ∗/θ∗ (cid:39) 5 × 10−5 could observationally distinguish

(from the ΛCDM model) a comparable parameter-space
volume (at 2σ conﬁdence-level) to SPHEREx measure-
ments of H(z = 0.57). The analogous measurement using
the SKA could empirically distinguish (from the ΛCDM
model) the whole parameter-space volume allowed by our
prior, up to sampling uncertainties, which allow 1/105
of the parameter-space volume to potentially evade con-
straints. Forthcoming cosmological observations could
thus either validate axiverse-inspired quintessence mod-
els or show that they are extremely ﬁne-tuned at the
1/105 level (or worse) in terms of parameter-space vol-
ume.

We now go beyond raw volume measurements to ex-
amine the detailed constraints in {δ, m, α} parameter
space. Here we show the allowed parameter space at
95% conﬁdence level. Results here are shown without
the 0.6 ≤ Ωφ ≤ 0.7, w ≤ −0.7, ‘dark-energy’ prior, to
see how much the data alone constrain the quintessence
parameter space. The allowed region for m sits well
within the scan range described above, so even though
this scan range amounts to a non-trivial (but linearly
ﬂat) prior, our conclusions do not depend on this prior.
We then resort the constraints as a function α(m, δi) and
use a third-order polynomial ﬁt to densely interpolate be-
tween points to get (approximately) continuous physical
allowed regions.

We consider the same set of current/future experi-
ments, with the addition of the WFIRST satellite [28]
(considering a measurement of the BAO feature at

10

z = 2). For Model A, we show the allowed region of
{δ, m, α} in Fig. 6, as constrained by BOSS (top left
panel) and Planck (bottom left panel) measurements of
{dA(z), H(z)} at z = 0.57 and θ∗ respectively. Pre-
dicted constraints (under the null hypothesis) from the
SPHEREx satellite [31] are shown in the top right panel.
The bottom right panel illustrates a comparison between
the allowed regions from BOSS, Planck, and SPHEREx
(predicted) measurements. We perform the same analy-
sis for Model B, with results shown in Fig. 7.

The main diﬀerence between models A and B is that at
the same mass and Peccei-Quinn scale, Model B is consid-
erably more ﬁnely tuned in δ. This trend subsists in the
forecasted constraints from future constraints, discussed
below (for the null hypothesis). We can see that there
is a common general behavior, that as α decreases, the
allowed mass increases and the allowed range of misalign-
ment angles decreases. For sub-Planckian Peccei-Quinn
scale α (cid:46) 1, the initial misalignment angle must be ﬁnely
tuned to lie near the top of the quintessence potential,
θ = π − δ (cid:39) π, and the axion mass m (cid:38) O(1)H0.

Qualitatively, these results arise from the requirement
that the quintessence ﬁeld have suﬃcient energy density
to explain current cosmic acceleration, without spoiling
the agreement of the standard cosmology at higher red-
shifts, where non-relativistic matter must dominate the
cosmic expansion history. The area of the parameter
space that is allowed from observational constraints is
very similar when comparing current BAO and CMB
measurements.
Increasing the precision in BAO mea-
surements shrinks the projection of the allowed region
onto two dimensions, but not dramatically.

We then investigated if having measurements of the
BAO peak at higher redshift can help reduce the area of
the allowed region. We predicted values of {dA(z), H(z)}
at z = 1 and z = 2 using our full grid of axion mod-
els, and then compared with a Fisher forecast of the
error bars of future galaxy surveys produced by the
SPHEREx satellite, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)
(for a speciﬁc SKA-oriented BAO measurement predic-
tion, see Ref. [46]), and the WFIRST satellite mission.
We predict the expected 95% conﬁdence constraints to
the {δ, m, α} parameter set. The results are shown in
Fig. 8 for Model A, and in Fig. 9 for Model B.
Qualitatively, we see that if future experiments are con-
sistent with the null hypothesis, the allowed region (as
parameterized by the angle δi) will become increasingly
ﬁnely tuned. On the other hand, future experiments will
not be dramatically more sensitive to any 2 of {δ, m, α}
than current measurements, in spite of the increasing pre-
cision in {dA(z), H(z)} measurements and the dramatic
decrease in allowed parameter-space volume. We can see
why this happens in Fig. 10, where we show the 95% con-
ﬁdence level ellipse (in dA and H, divided by their ﬁducial
values), for a futuristic experiment probing dA and H at
0.1% precision.

The points in Fig. 10 show predictions for diﬀerent
choices of parameters for the axion model. For each

VII. CONCLUSIONS

By positing the existence of many light ﬁelds, the ax-
iverse scenario raises the possibility that today’s epoch
of accelerated cosmic expansion results from a moder-
ate ﬁne tuning, in which today’s acceleration occurs in

a fraction ∼ 10−3 → 10−2 of cosmological draws of the
axion misalignment angle δ, as long as the dimension-
less Peccei-Quinn scale α = fa/Mpl (cid:38) 0.1. This is a
vast improvement with respect to the required ﬁne tun-

zon, the BAO feature measured in galaxy surveys and
the angular scale of the CMB acoustic peaks. In terms of
parameter space volume, the CMB is dramatically more
constraining, eliminating a fraction ∼ 0.8 of models that
pass a well motivated dark-energy prior. In the projected
parameter space of m and δ (for sub-Planckian fa), we
ﬁnd that the CMB and BAO measurements constrain
axiverse-inspired quintessence models to comparable ar-
eas in parameter space. In the future, cosmic-variance
limited measurements of CMB polarization and very sen-

empirically distinguishing (from the ΛCDM model) all

energy priors.

Appendix A: Axiverse-inspired quintessence and the

CMB

Dark energy contributes to the expansion history of the
universe but clusters very weakly (and indeed, is com-
pletely smooth in the limit of a pure cosmological con-
stant). As a result, gravitational potential wells decay on
scales that enter the horizon during dark-energy domi-
nation. This late-time Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) ef-
fect imprints additional temperature anisotropies on the
CMB at low multipole index (cid:96). The detailed evolution
of w in axion models will thus aﬀect the precise shape
of both the CMB temperature anisotropy power spec-
trum C TT
and galaxy-CMB temperature cross power-
spectrum C T g
[6, 13] at low (cid:96). Although the statistical
signiﬁcance of measurements of these quantities at low (cid:96)
is limited by cosmic variance, there could be axion dark-
energy models allowed by the constraints of Sec. VI that
are further constrained by the imprint of the late-time
ISW eﬀect on C TT

and C Tg

The quintessence-induced change to the angular sound
horizon θ∗ drives the CMB constraints/forecasts of Sec.
VI, but here we explore if this simple geometric con-
straint captures the full power of the CMB to probe
axiverse-inspired. We do this by computing in greater de-
tail the eﬀect of axiverse-inspired quintessence on CMB
anisotropies.

The quintessence ﬁeld φ may depend on spatial loca-
tion as well as time, and must be permitted to carry spa-
tial perturbations in a self-consistent computation of ob-
servable quantities like C TT
for a quintessence cosmology.

In recent work by one of us and other collaborators [51],
these equations were self-consistently implemented in the
CMB Boltzmann code camb [20] for a quadratic poten-
tial (in that case, allowing for both slowly rolling axion
dark energy and coherently oscillating axion dark mat-
ter), along with the accompanying equations for the mean
axion energy-density and pressure, which aﬀect the re-
combination and decoupling history of the universe.

Here, we have generalized this modiﬁed camb [20] us-
ing the full Model-A and Model-B anharmonic potentials
in Eq. (1)-(2), but restrict ourself to the ‘dark-energy like’
part of parameter space in the language of Ref. [51]. We
solve the quintessence perturbation equations of motion
numerically. The axion potential enters only through the
evolution of the equation of state w(a) and axion adia-
batic sound speed cad. We thus solve Eq. (3) numerically,
evaluating w(a) and c2
ad as described in detail in Ref. [51].
These functions are then tabulated and interpolated by
our modiﬁed version of camb to obtain cosmological ob-
servables like C TT
. Unlike the treatment in Ref. [51], we
do not solve Eqs. (A1)-(A2) with a WKB approximation.
For both Model A and B, we generate 790 uniformly
sampled (in log δ, m, and log α) subsets of the full grid
of models used to generate constraints in Sec. VI and
generate the resulting CMB power spectra. One exam-
ple (for Model A) is shown in Fig. 11, which shows the
ΛCDM C TT
power spectrum, along with the results of

(cid:96)

(cid:96)

the full quintessence-modiﬁed camb computation, after
applying the mapping (cid:96) → (cid:96) × θ∗/θﬁd∗ , where θﬁd∗
is the
angular sound horizon in our ﬁducial cosmology (with
no axiverse-inspired quintessence). This mapping should
undo the change to C TT
induced by quintessence-induced
changes to the angular sound horizon and isolate the ef-
fect induced by the late-time ISW eﬀect.

We see that C TT

(cid:96) /C TT

looks almost indistinguishable from
the ΛCDM case after remapping the sound horizon,
with some visibly discernible deviation from the ﬁdu-
cial case for (cid:96) ≤ 50. We ﬁnd that the fractional change
to C TT
is negligible, compared both with cosmic vari-
ance and the benchmark for noise-free parameter ﬁtting,
|∆C TT
| = 3/(cid:96) [52]. We can see that even for this
model (which shows the most dramatic deviation from
ΛCDM in our subsample after remapping the angular
sound horizon) that the modiﬁcations to the late-time
ISW eﬀect induced by the quintessence ﬁeld are well be-
low cosmic variance at all scales and hence undetectable.
In other words, the constraints imposed in Sec. VI using
CMB measurements of θ∗ are robust for axiverse-inspired
quintessence models.

We ﬁnd that remapping of θ∗ is able to absorb ∼ 99%
of the change in χ2/d.o.f between the quintessence and
ΛCDM model, showing that additional changes to C TT
from the late-time ISW eﬀect are negligible. The much

larger change in the ISW eﬀect between axion and ΛCDM
Models seen in Ref.
[51] results from the much wider
range of axion masses considered in that work, where
axions were considered as both dark matter and dark-
energy candidates.

As camb includes many diﬀerent physical eﬀects, not
just the ISW eﬀect, it is interesting to consider a simpler
calculation that isolates the eﬀect of dark energy on the
ISW eﬀect. To this end, we implement the equations of
Ref. [53] for the ISW eﬀect sourced by cosmological per-
turbation modes with a variety of comoving wavenumbers
k. We assume an arbitrary initial perturbation normal-
ization (with no additional power-spectrum induced scale
dependence). We use the same 790 models as above but
impose the ‘dark-energy’ prior discussed above.

We then compare the results to the null hypothesis,
with results shown in Fig. 12 for modes roughly cor-
responding to the multipoles (cid:96) = 2 and (cid:96) = 3. The
correspondence between wavenumber is treated approxi-
mately, via (cid:96) (cid:39) π/θ = πda(zrec)/rdec. We see from Fig.
12 that the ∼ 5% change in CMB anisotropies at low (cid:96) is
much smaller than cosmic variance, conﬁrming our con-
clusion that the late-time ISW induced change to CMB
anisotropies from axiverse-inspired quintessence is unde-
tectable.2
