R-parity Conserving Minimal SUSY B − L Model

Nobuchika Okada and Nathan Papapietro

Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487, USA

Abstract

We propose a simple gauged U(1)B−L extension of the minimal supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM), where R-parity is conserved as usual in the MSSM. The global B − L (baryon
number minus lepton number) symmetry in the MSSM is gauged and three MSSM gauge-singlet
chiral multiplets with a unit B − L charge are introduced, ensuring the model free from gauge
and gravitational anomalies. We assign an odd R-parity for two of the new chiral multiplets
and hence they are identiﬁed with the right-handed neutrino superﬁelds, while an even R-parity
is assigned to the other one (Φ). The scalar component of Φ plays the role of a Higgs ﬁeld to
break the U(1)B−L symmetry through its negative mass squared, which is radiatively generated
by the renormalization group running of soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking parameters from
a high energy. This radiative U(1)B−L symmetry breaking leads to its breaking scale being at
the TeV naturally. Because of our novel R-parity assignment, three light neutrinos are Dirac
particles with one massless state. Since R-parity is conserved, the lightest neutralino is a prime
candidate of the dark matter as usual. In our model, the lightest eigenstate of the mixture of the
B − L gaugino and the fermionic component of Φ appears as a new dark matter candidate. We
investigate phenomenology of this dark matter particle. We also discuss collider phenomenology
of our model. In particular, the B − L gauge boson (Z ′), once discovered at the Large Hadron
Collider, can be a probe to determine the number of (right-handed) Dirac neutrinos with its
invisible decay width, in sharp contrast with the conventional B − L extension of the SM or
MSSM where the right-handed neutrinos are heavy Majorana particles and decay to the SM
leptons.

Introduction

The B − L (baryon number minus lepton number) is the unique anomaly-free global U(1)B−L
symmetry in the Standard Model (SM). This symmetry is easily gauged, and the so-called
minimal B − L model [1]-[6] is a simple gauged B − L extension of the SM, where three right-
handed neutrinos and an SM gauge singlet Higgs ﬁeld with two units of the B − L charge are
introduced. The three right-handed neutrinos are necessarily introduced to make the model
free from all gauge and gravitational anomalies. Associated with a B − L symmetry breaking
by a Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) of the B − L Higgs ﬁeld, the B − L gauge ﬁeld (Z ′
boson) and the right-handed neutrinos acquire their masses. After the electroweak symmetry
breaking, tiny SM neutrino masses are generated via the seesaw mechanism [7]-[11].

Although the scale of the B−L gauge symmetry breaking is arbitrary as long as phenomeno-
logical constraints are satisﬁed, a breaking at the TeV scale is probably the most interesting

possibility in the view point of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments. However, mass
squared corrections of the B − L Higgs (any Higgs ﬁelds in 4-dimensional models, in general)
are quadratically sensitive to the scale of a possible ultraviolet theory, and as a result the
B − L symmetry breaking scale is unstable against quantum corrections. As is well-known,
supersymmetric (SUSY) extension is the most promising way to solve this vacuum instabil-
ity. Very interestingly, SUSY extension of the minimal B − L model oﬀers a way to naturally
realize the B − L symmetry breaking at the TeV scale. With suitable inputs of soft SUSY
breaking parameters at a high energy, their renormalization group (RG) evolutions drive the
B − L Higgs mass squared negative and therefore the B − L gauge symmetry is radiatively
broken [12, 13, 14]. Since the scale of the negative mass squared is controlled by the soft SUSY
breaking parameters, the B − L breaking scale lies at the TeV from naturalness.

SUSY extension opens a further possibility. As has been proposed in Ref. [15], it is not
necessary to introduce the B−L Higgs ﬁeld, since the scalar partner of a right-handed neutrino
can play the same role as the B − L Higgs ﬁeld in breaking the B − L gauge symmetry. Hence,
we can deﬁne the “minimal SUSY B − L model” by a particle content, where only three right-
handed neutrino chiral superﬁelds are added to the particle content of the minimal SUSY SM

(MSSM). It is interesting that such a particle content can be derived from heterotic strings [16,
17]. In Ref. [15], a negative soft mass squared of a right-handed sneutrino is assumed to break
the B − L gauge symmetry, so that the B − L symmetry breaking occurs at the TeV scale.
Associated with this symmetry breaking, R-parity is also spontaneously broken, and many
interesting phenomenologies with the R-parity violation have been discussed [18, 19, 20, 21].

Through the non-zero VEV of the right-handed sneutrino, mixings between neutrinos, MSSM
Higgsinos, MSSM neutralinos and B − L gaugino are generated. Although the neutrino mass

1

matrix becomes very complicated, it has enough number of degrees of freedom to reproduce
the neutrino oscillation data with a characteristic pattern of the mass spectrum [22, 23].

In this paper, we propose the minimal SUSY B − L model with an R-parity conservation.
The particle content is the same as the one of the minimal SUSY B − L model discussed above,
while we assign an even R-parity to one right-handed neutrino chiral superﬁeld (Φ) and an odd

R-parity to the other two right-handed neutrino chiral superﬁelds. The R-parity assignment for
the MSSM ﬁelds is as usual. Because of this parity assignment and the gauge symmetry, the

chiral superﬁeld Φ has no Dirac Yukawa coupling with the lepton doublet ﬁelds. In fact, it does
not appear in the renormalizable superpotential. We consider the case that the B−L symmetry
breaking is driven by a VEV of the R-parity even right-handed sneutrino. Phenomenological
consequences in this model are very diﬀerent from those of the conventional minimal SUSY
B − L model. As usual in the MSSM, R-parity is conserved and hence the lightest neutralino
is a candidate of the dark matter. In addition to the lightest neutralino in the MSSM, the
model oﬀers a new candidate for the dark matter, namely, a linear combination of the fermion
component of Φ and the B − L gaugino. Since Φ has no Dirac Yukawa coupling, no Majorana
mass term is generated in the SM neutrino sector, and as a result, the SM neutrinos are Dirac

particles. With only the two right-handed neutrinos involved in the Dirac Yukawa couplings,
the Dirac neutrino mass matrix leads to three mass eigenstates, one massless chiral neutrino and

two Dirac neutrinos. A general 2-by-3 Dirac mass matrix includes a number of free parameters
enough to reproduce the neutrino oscillation data. This Dirac nature of the SM neutrinos are
quite distinctive from those in the usual B − L model, where the right-handed neutrinos are
heavy Majorana particles and the mass eigenstates diﬀerent from the light SM neutrinos. If the
Z ′ boson is discovered at the LHC, this diﬀerence could be tested through its decay products

and the decay width measurements.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we deﬁne our minimal SUSY B − L
model with a novel R-parity assignment. Then, we introduce the superpotential and soft SUSY
breaking terms relevant for our discussion. In Sec. 3, we discuss a way to radiatively break the
B − L gauge symmetry, while keeping R-parity manifest. Focusing on the B − L sector, for
simplicity, we perform a numerical analysis for the RG evolutions of the soft SUSY breaking
masses of the right-handed sneutrinos, and show that the B − L gauge symmetry is radiatively
In Sec. 4, we consider a
broken at the TeV scale by a VEV of the scalar component of Φ.
new dark matter candidate which is a linear combination of the scalar component of Φ and the
B − L gaugino. We show a parameter set which can reproduce the observed dark matter relic
density. In Sec. 5, we also brieﬂy discuss an implication of the Dirac neutrinos to the LHC

phenomenology through the Z ′ boson production. The last section is devoted for conclusions

2 Minimal SUSY B−L model with a conserved R-parity
The minimal SUSY B−L model is based on the gauge group of SU(3)c×SU(2)L×U(1)Y ×U(1)B−L.
In addition to the MSSM particle content, we introduce three chiral superﬁelds which are sin-
glets under the SM gauge groups and have a unit B− L charge. The new ﬁelds are identiﬁed as
the right-handed neutrino chiral superﬁelds, and their existence is essential to make the model

free from all gauge and gravitational anomalies. Unlikely to direct supersymmetrization of the
minimal B − L model, the B − L Higgs superﬁelds are not included in the particle content.
The key of our proposal is that we assign an even R-parity to one right-handed neutrino chiral
superﬁeld, in contrast with the minimal SUSY B − L model proposed in Ref. [15], where all
the right-handed neutrino superﬁelds are R-parity odd as usual. The particle content is listed

in Table 1.

The gauge and parity invariant superpotential which is added to the MSSM one is only the

neutrino Dirac Yukawa coupling as

(1)

Note that the Yukawa coupling for Φ is forbidden by the parity, and Φ has no direct coupling
with the MSSM ﬁelds. After the electroweak symmetry breaking, the neutrino Dirac mass

matrix is generated. Since this is a 2-by-3 matrix, one neutrino remains massless. Therefore,
we have one massless neutrino and two Dirac neutrinos in the model. The 2-by-3 Dirac mass

3

matrix has a suﬃcient number of free parameters to reproduce the neutrino oscillation data.
Although we have introduced the special parity assignment, this may be unnecessary in the

practical point of view. Without the parity assignment, the superpotential in Eq. (1) can
include

which are unique direct couplings between Φ and the MSSM ﬁelds. Let us now take a limit
yj
D → 0, which switch oﬀ the direct communication of Φ with the lepton and Higgs doublets. In
this sense, our parity assignment can be regarded as a result of symmetry enhancement caused
by this limit. Since the neutrinos are Dirac particles, the Dirac Yukawa coupling constants must
be extremely small in order to reproduce the observed neutrino mass scale. We will discuss a

possibility to naturally realize such small parameters in the last section.

Next, we introduce soft SUSY breaking terms for the ﬁelds in the B − L sector:

the next section, we analyze the RG evolutions of the soft SUSY breaking masses and ﬁnd that
m2
φ is driven to be negative and the U(1)B−L symmetry is radiatively broken. Although we do
not assume the grand uniﬁcation of our model, we take MU = 2× 1016 GeV as a reference scale
at which the boundary conditions for the soft masses are given.

3 Radiative B − L symmetry breaking

It is well-known that the electroweak symmetry breaking in the MSSM is triggered by radiative

corrections which drive soft mass squared of the up-type Higgs doublet negative. Because of
this radiative symmetry breaking, the electroweak symmetry breaking scale is controlled by the

soft SUSY breaking mass scale and the SUSY breaking scale at the TeV naturally results in the
right electroweak scale of O(100 GeV). Similarly to the MSSM, a radiative B − L symmetry
breaking occurs by the RG evolution of soft SUSY breaking parameters from a high energy to
low energies. However, the mechanism that drives m2
φ negative is diﬀerent from the one in the
MSSM where the large top Yukawa coupling plays a crucial role.

To make our discussion simple, we consider the RG equations only for the B − L sector.1

In Eq. (5) the contributions from very small Dirac Yukawa couplings are omitted. In fact, the

their soft squared masses also appear in the RG equations, but we have omitted them, for
simplicity, by assuming they are much smaller than m2

We now analyze the scalar potential with the soft SUSY breaking parameters obtained from

This result is consistent with our choice of vBL = 14 TeV in evaluating the running soft masses.

In our parameter choice, the Z ′ boson mass is given by

mZ ′ = gBLvBL = 3.5 TeV.

(12)

The ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC Run-2 have been searching for the Z ′ boson

resonance with the dilepton ﬁnal state and have recently reported their results which are con-
sistent with the SM expectaions [26, 27]. In Ref. [28], the ATLAS and CMS search results are
interpreted to a constraint on the Z ′ boson in the minimal B− L model, where an upper bound
of the the B − L gauge coupling as a function of Z ′ boson mass has been obtained. We refer
the results in Ref. [28] such that gBL ≤ 0.328 and 0.350 for mZ ′ = 3.5 TeV from the ATLAS
and CMS results, respectively.2 Our parameter choice of gBL = 0.250 for mZ ′ = 3.5 TeV is
consistent with the recent LHC Run-2 results.

4 Right-handed neutrino dark matter

As we showed in the previous section, the B − L gauge symmetry is radiatively broken by the
RG eﬀects on the soft SUSY breaking masses. Since the breaking occurs by the VEV of R-parity

even scalar ﬁeld φ, R-parity is still manifest, by which the stability of the lightest R-parity odd

particle is ensured. Thus, as usual in the MSSM, the lightest neutralino is a candidate of the
dark matter. In addition to the MSSM neutralinos, a new dark matter candidate arises in our

model, namely, the fermion component of Φ (ψ). We can call ψ the R-parity odd right-handed
neutrino. In this section, we study phenomenology of the right-handed neutrino dark matter.
A scenario of the parity-odd right-handed Majorana neutrino dark matter was ﬁrst proposed
in [30] in the context of the non-SUSY minimal B − L model, where a Z2 parity is introduced
and an odd parity is assigned to one right-handed neutrino while the other ﬁelds are all parity-

even. Because of the Z2-parity conservation, the parity-odd right-handed neutrino becomes
stable and hence the dark matter candidate. Phenomenology of this dark matter has been

investigated in [30, 31, 32]. Recently, in terms of the complementarity to the LHC physics, the
right-handed neutrino dark matter has been investigated in detail [28]. Supersymmetric version
of the minimal B − L model with the right-handed neutrino dark matter has been proposed in
[14].

Our dark matter scenario that we will investigate in this section shares similar properties

with the scenario discussed in [14]. However, there is a crucial diﬀerence that ψ has no Majorana
mass by its own, but it acquires a Majorana mass through a mixing with the B − L gaugino
(λBL). After the U(1)B−L symmetry breaking, a mass matrix for ψ and λBL is generated to be

(13)

(14)

with tan 2θ = 2mZ ′/MBL. Let us assume that the lighter mass eigenstate (χℓ) is the lightest
neutralino. Since ψ and λBL are the SM gauge singlets, possible annihilation processes of
the dark matter are very limited. Furthermore, given a small B − L gauge coupling and the
Majorana nature of the dark matter particle, the annihilation process via sfermion exchanges

is not eﬃcient. We ﬁnd that a pair of dark matter particles can annihilate eﬃciently only if
the dark matter mass is close to half of the Z ′ boson mass and the Z ′ boson resonance in the
s-channel annihilation process enhances the cross section. Let us set MBL ≃ (3/2)mZ ′, so that
the lightest mass eigenvalue is found to be mDM ≃ mZ ′/2 and cos2 θ ≃ 0.8. Our parameter
choice in the previous section is suitable for this setup, MBL = (3/2)mZ ′ = 5.25 TeV for
mZ ′ = 3.5 TeV.

Let us now calculate the dark matter relic abundance by integrating the Boltzmann equation

the dark matter number density to the entropy density s) of the dark matter particle, YEQ is
the yield of the dark matter particle in thermal equilibrium, and hσvi is the thermal average
of the dark matter annihilation cross section times relative velocity. Explicit formulas of the

In our analysis, only three parameters, namely gBL, mZ ′
and mDM , are involved.3 As mentioned above, a suﬃciently large annihilation cross section is
achieved only if mDM ≃ mZ ′/2. Thus, we focus on the dark matter mass in this region and
in this case cos2 θ ≃ 0.8. For gBL = 0.250, mZ ′ = 3.5 TeV and cos2 θ = 0.8, Fig. 2 shows the
resultant dark matter relic abundance as a function of the dark matter mass mDM , along with
the bound 0.1183 ≤ ΩDM h2 ≤ 0.1213 (65% limit) from the Planck satellite experiment [33]
(two horizontal dashed lines). We have conﬁrmed that only if the dark matter mass is close to

half of the Z ′ boson mass, the observed relic abundance can be reproduced.

Implication of Dirac neutrino to LHC physics

Because of our R-parity assignment, the SM neutrinos are Dirac particles in our model. This is
quite distinct from usual B − L extension of the SM, where right-handed neutrinos are heavy
Majorana states. Since the right-handed neutrinos are singlet under the SM gauge groups
and the Dirac Yukawa coupling constants are very small in both Dirac and Majorana cases,
the right-handed neutrinos can communicate with the SM particles only through Z ′ boson

exchange. As we mentioned above, the search for Z ′ boson resonance is underway at the LHC
Run-2. Once discovered at the LHC, the Z ′ boson will allows us to investigate physics of the

right-handed neutrinos through precise measurements of Z ′ boson properties. In this section
we consider an implication of the Dirac neutrinos to LHC physics.

When the right-handed neutrinos are heavy Majorana particles as in the minimal B − L
model, a pair of right-handed Majorana neutrinos, if kinematically allowed, can be produced
through Z ′ boson decays at the LHC. The produced right-handed neutrino subsequently decays

to weak gauge bosons/Higgs boson plus leptons. Because of the Majorana nature of the right-
handed neutrino, the ﬁnal states include same-sign leptons. This is a characteristic signature

from the lepton number violation, and we expect a high possibility to detect such ﬁnal states
with less SM background. For a detailed studies, see, for example, Ref. [34].

The Majorana neutrinos are heavy and can be produced only if they are kinematically

allowed, while the Dirac neutrinos in our model are always included in the Z ′ boson decay
products. However, they cannot be detected just like the usual SM neutrinos produced at

colliders. This process may remind us of the neutrino production at the LEP through the
resonant production of the Z boson. It was a great success of the LEP experiment that the

precise measurement of the Z boson decay width and the production cross section at energies
around the Z boson peak has determined the number of the SM neutrinos to be three [35]. We

notice that the Z ′ production is quite analogous to the Z production at the LEP. Although
the right-handed neutrinos produced by the Z ′ boson are completely undetectable, the total Z ′
boson decay width carries the information of the invisible decay width. A precise measurement

of the Z ′ boson cross section at the LHC may reveal the existence of the right-handed Dirac
neutrinos. To illustrate this idea, we calculate in the following the diﬀerential cross section for
the process with the dilepton ﬁnal states, pp → ℓ+ℓ− with ℓ = e, µ mediated by photon, Z
boson and Z ′ boson at the LHC with a collider energy √s = 14 TeV.

Figure 3: The diﬀerential cross section for pp → e+e−X + µ+µ−X at the 14 TeV LHC for
mZ ′ = 3.5 TeV and gBL = 0.250. The solid and dashed curves correspond to the results for
N(νR) = 2 and 0, respectively. The horizontal long-dashed line represents the SM cross section,
which is negligible compared with the Z ′ boson mediated process.

and N(νR) = 2, where N(νR) is the number of right-handed (Dirac) neutrinos. For our case
with N(νR) = 2, the total Z ′ boson decay width is given in Eq. (19), while the number 15 in
the bracket must be replaced to 12 for N(νR) = 0.

Fig. 3 shows the diﬀerential cross section for pp → e+e−X + µ+µ−X for mZ ′ = 3.5 TeV and
gBL = 0.250, along with the SM cross section mediated by the Z-boson and photon (horizontal
long-dashed line). The solid and dashed curves correspond to the results for N(νR) = 2 and 0,
respectively. The dependence of the total decay width on the number of right-handed neutrinos
reﬂects the resultant cross sections. When we choose a kinematical region for the invariant mass
in the range, MZ ′ − 100 ≤ Mll(GeV) ≤ MZ ′ + 100, for example, the signal events of 892 and
1049 for N(νR) = 2 and 0, respectively, would be observed with the prospective integrated
luminosity of 1000/fb at the High-Luminosity LHC. The diﬀerence between N(νR) = 2 and 0
are distinguishable with a 4 − 5σ signiﬁcance.

6 Conclusions and discussions

We have proposed a simple gauged U(1)B−L extension of the MSSM, where R-parity is conserved
as usual in the MSSM. The global B − L symmetry in the MSSM is gauged and three right-
handed neutrino chiral multiplets are introduced, which make the model free from all gauge
and gravitational anomalies. No B− L Higgs ﬁeld is introduced. We assign an even R-parity to
one right-handed neutrino superﬁeld Φ, while the other two right-handed neutrino superﬁelds
are odd as usual. The scalar component of Φ plays a role of the B − L Higgs ﬁeld to beak
the U(1)B−L gauge symmetry through its negative mass squared which is radiatively generated
by the RG evolution of soft SUSY breaking parameters. Therefore, the scale of the U(1)B−L
symmetry breaking is controlled by the SUSY breaking parameters and naturally be at the TeV

scale. We have shown that this radiative symmetry breaking actually occurs with a suitable
choice of model parameters. Because of our novel R-parity assignment, three light neutrinos

are Dirac particles with one massless state. Since R-parity is conserved, the lightest neutralino
is a prime candidate of the dark matter of the universe. Depending on its mass, the lighter
Majorana mass eigenstate (χℓ) of a mixture of the B − L gaugino and the fermionic component
of Φ (R-parity odd right-handed neutrino) appears as a new dark matter candidate. Assuming
χℓ is the lightest R-parity odd particle, we have calculated the dark matter relic abundance.
When the mass of χℓ is close to half of the Z ′ boson mass, the pair annihilation cross section of
the dark matter particle is enhanced through the Z ′ boson resonance in the s-channel process

and the observed dark matter relic abundance is reproduced. We have also discussed LHC
phenomenology for the Dirac neutrinos. The Z ′ boson, once discovered at the LHC, will be a

novel probe of the Dirac nature of the light neutrinos since its invisible decay processes include
the ﬁnal states with one massless (left-handed) neutrino and two Dirac neutrinos, in sharp
contrast with the conventional B − L extension of the SM or MSSM, where the right-handed
neutrinos are heavy Majorana particles and decay to the weak gauge bosons/Higgs boson plus
leptons. If the Z ′ boson is discovered, the High-Luminosity LHC may reveal the existence of

the right-handed neutrino with a precise measurement of the total decay width of Z ′ boson.

Since the neutrinos are Dirac particles in our model, their Dirac Yukawa coupling must

be extremely small.
It is an important issue how to naturally realize such a small Yukawa
coupling, or a huge hierarchy between the neutrino Yukawa coupling and those of the other
SM fermions, in a reasonable theoretical framework. In addition, the mass squared hierarchy
between φ and the other right-handed sneutrinos is crucial to achieve the radiative B− L gauge
symmetry breaking. Realizing this hierarchy in a natural way is an additional issue. In order

to solve these hierarchy problems, we may extend the model to the brane-world framework
with 5-dimensional warped space-time [38]. Arranging the bulk mass parameters for the bulk

12

hypermultiplets corresponding to matter and Higgs ﬁelds in the minimal SUSY B − L model,
we can obtain large hierarchy among parameters in 4-dimensional eﬀective theory with mildly

hierarchical model parameters in the original 5-dimensional theory. This direction is worth
investigating [39].
