(Dated:)

A study of the λ- and N -atomic conﬁgurations under dipolar interaction with 2 modes of elec-
tromagnetic radiation is presented. The corresponding quantum phase diagrams are obtained by
means of a variational procedure. Both conﬁgurations exhibit normal and collective (super-radiant)
regimes. While the latter in the λ-conﬁguration divides itself into 2 subregions, corresponding to
each of the modes, that in the N -conﬁguration may be divided into 2 or 3 subregions depending on
whether the ﬁeld modes divide the atomic system into 2 separate subsystems or not.

Our variational procedure compares well with the exact quantum solution. The properties of the

relevant ﬁeld and matter observables are obtained.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction between matter and radiation has been
determinant in the study of quantum optics and informa-
tion science. A simple and useful model was proposed by
Dicke [1], which enhances the cooperative nature of the
spontaneous emission from a system of identical atoms.
In this model the system suﬀers a transition from a nor-
mal to a superradiant phase [2, 3]. Artiﬁcial atoms can be
realized as an approximation to real atoms [4–6], which
exhibits the transition to this superradiant regime [7, 8].
A ﬁrst generalization of the model is the considera-
tion of atoms of three or more levels [9–11]. These allow
to consider dipolar interactions with one, two, or more
modes of electromagnetic ﬁeld, and have been extensively
studied [9, 10, 12–17].

Recently, the generalized Dicke model has been studied
to determine the quantum phase diagrams of Na atoms of
n-levels interacting dipolarly with (cid:96) modes of electromag-
netic ﬁeld, where each mode promotes transitions only
between two given atomic levels [17].
In this work we
generalize this study to the case where one mode can
connect more than one pair of levels in the particular
4-level atomic conﬁgurations λ and N .

The quantum phase diagrams are obtained by means
of a variational procedure, which allows for analytical
expressions both for the critical variables and the ex-
pectation values of the ﬁeld and matter operators, and
conﬁrmed through the exact quantum calculation (even
for a value of Na as low as 1).

This paper is organized as follows: Section II describes
the Hamiltonian for a system of Na atoms in the 4-level
λ and N conﬁgurations, under dipolar interaction with
2 modes of electromagnetic ﬁeld. A transition between a
given pair of levels is promoted by only one mode, but
one mode may promote transitions between more than

one pair of levels. A variational test function used to cal-
culate the energy surface of the λ system is given in sec-
tion III, and the ground state is estimated by minimizing
it with respect to the ﬁeld and matter variables. This al-
lows for analytical expressions for the expectation values
of the relevant ﬁeld and matter operators, and the results
are compared with the exact quantum solution. The cor-
responding analysis for the N -conﬁguration is presented
in section IV. Section V gives some concluding remarks.

one ﬁnds the state |0(cid:105)F ⊗|Na, 0, 0, 0(cid:105)M and the minimum
variational energy is

A. Variational ground state

In order to ﬁnd the variational energy surface we use as
a test function the direct product of coherent states for
the ﬁeld and matter. For the ﬁeld contribution we take
the Heisenberg-Weyl states |(cid:126)α(cid:105) = |α1(cid:105)⊗|α2(cid:105), and for the
matter contribution we take the totally symmetric U (4)
coherent states |(cid:126)γ(cid:105) = |γ1 γ2 γ3 γ4(cid:105) [18],

conﬁguration. All other extrema yield a reduction of the
λ conﬁguration, as given in what follows:

Reduction of the λ conﬁguration.- When at least one
critical value is non-zero the system reduces to subsys-
tems with a lower number of levels [17]. This is schemat-
ically shown in Fig. 2. When c
3 remain
ﬁnite, the equations for the critical points reduce to those
of the 3-level Λ-conﬁguration for ω1, ω2 and ω3, interact-
ing dipolarly with one mode (Ω1), for which one may to
obtain analytical solutions [13, 14] under the equal de-
tuning (ω2 = ω1) condition. This system has in turn
its normal and collective regions, separated by the curve
23)− (ω3 − ω1)Ω1 = 0 in the µ-parameter space.

The state in the normal region is |0(cid:105)F ⊗ |Na, 0, 0, 0(cid:105)M ,
and in the collective region is obtained by substituting in
Eq. (4) the critical values for SΛ given in Table I. Further
reductions of this conﬁguration to 2 levels give results
which are contained in the minima of Λ by restricting
oneself to the axes µ13 = 0 or µ23 = 0.

detuning ω1 = ω2, where the subindex of S denotes the
region where the corresponding energy dominates.
In
this, the normal region is shown in black and the order
of the transitions is also indicated. As known [18], the 3-
level Λ-conﬁguration in the equal detuning has a second-
order transition when the state goes from the normal to
collective region Snorm (cid:42)(cid:41) S0
Λ, which is related to the
fact that the critical points in the separatrix for this case
form bifurcations. In general, both ﬁrst and second order
transitions for Snorm (cid:42)(cid:41) SΛ occur [14]. A ﬁrst order tran-
sition occurs both for Snorm (cid:42)(cid:41) S34 and for S(0)
(cid:42)(cid:41) S34
Λ
because the critical points along this separatrix form a
Maxwell set [17, 19], and this result remains in the gen-
eral case SΛ (cid:42)(cid:41) S34.

FIG. 3.
(color online) Phase diagram of the 4-level λ-
conﬁguration interacting dipolarly with two modes of elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. The normal region is shown in black. The
order of the transitions is also indicated. The collective re-
gion is divided into subregions where each mode dominates:
Ω1 below the blue surface (subregion denoted by SΛ) and
Ω2 above it (subregion denoted by S34). The region S23
corresponds to the back wall (in green), given by µ13 = 0
within the SΛ region. The parameter space is drawn for
Ω1 = 1, Ω2 = 0.25, ω1 = ω2 = 0, ω3 = 1.1 and ω4 = 1.3.

The relevant expectation values of the ﬁeld and mat-
ter observables may be calculated from these variational
states analytically. These are shown in Table II, where
(cid:104)νi(cid:105) denotes the expectation value of the number of pho-
tons of mode Ωi for i = 1, 2, and (cid:104)Akk(cid:105) that of the pop-
ulation of level k, for k = 1, . . . , 4.

B. Quantum ground state

Let us deﬁne the operator Π(K) = exp(i π K). Im-
posing [Π(K), Hλ] = 0 we obtain 3 constants of motion
of the system associated to

K1 = A11 + A22 − ν1 ,
K2 = A33 + ν1 − ν2 ,

K3 = A44 + ν2 .

The limit 2 → ∞ with c

2 for k = 3, 4 leads
(cf. Fig. 2) to a 3-level Ξ-conﬁguration in the parameters
ηk (k = 2, 3, 4) interacting with a 2-mode ﬁeld. Following
the same procedure [13, 14], this in turn reduces to 2-level
systems:

k = ηk c

For η4 = 0, one gets a 2-level system in the vari-
ables η2, η3, with its normal and collective regions sepa-
23 − (ω3 − ω2)Ω1 = 0 and minimum energies

and the corresponding to Eq. (4) when the critical values
for S23 in Table I are substituted.
On the other hand by taking the limit η3 → ∞, a 2-
level system in the variables ζ3, ζ4 is obtained, with its
normal and collective regions separated by the Maxwell
34 − (ω4 − ω3)Ω2 = 0 and minimum energies

Minimum energy surface.- The minimum variational
energy surface as a function of the dipolar strengths is
then

Eλmin = min{Enorm, EΛ, E23, E34} ,

with the critical values of the Hamiltonian variables in
each region shown in Table I.

This divides the whole parameter space (µ13, µ23, µ34)
into monochromatic subregions Si, each of which is dom-
inated by a mode of the radiation ﬁeld, in agreement
with [17]. This is shown in Figure 3 for the case of equal

Hoe = L {|φ(cid:105)oe} odd even

with minimum energies Eee, Eeo, Eoe and Eoo respec-
tively, and hence the ground quantum energy value is

given by

Eg = min{Eee, Eeo, Eoe, Eoo} .

(16)

The calculation is performed by truncating the basis
at a value Mmax of M which guarantees convergence of
the lowest eigenvalue E in each Hilbert subspace, and
via Eq. (16) we determine the ground state eigenvalue
Eg and its corresponding eigenvector |φg(cid:105).

In order to exemplify we consider the case Na = 1
and evaluate for this ground state the expectation val-
ues of the number of photons (cid:104)ν1(cid:105) and (cid:104)ν2(cid:105). We con-
ﬁrm the fact that the collective region is divided in
monochromatic regions (cf. Fig. 3), and obtain the re-
sults shown in Figure 4. In sub-ﬁgure (a) (cid:104)ν1(cid:105) (empty
circles) and (cid:104)ν2(cid:105) (empty diamonds) are plotted as func-
tions of µ = µ23, for µ13 = µ34 = 0.25; and (cid:104)ν1(cid:105) (contin-
uous line) and (cid:104)ν2(cid:105) (dashed line) are plotted as functions
of µ = µ13, for µ23 = µ34 = 0.25. We see that the bulk of
the quantum ground state remains in a subspace which
only has contribution from the Ω1-mode. Sub-ﬁgure (b)
shows (cid:104)ν1(cid:105) (dashed line) and (cid:104)ν2(cid:105) (continuous line) for
µ13 = µ23 = 0.25 as functions of µ34. In this region the
bulk of the ground state is in a subspace which only has
contribution from mode Ω2.

IV. N -CONFIGURATION

As a second example we consider 4-level atoms in the
N -conﬁguration interacting with two modes of electro-
magnetic ﬁeld. We consider the case when the mode Ω1
promotes transitions between levels 1 (cid:42)(cid:41) 3 and 2 (cid:42)(cid:41) 4,
and the mode Ω2 promotes transitions between levels
2 (cid:42)(cid:41) 3 (cf. Fig. 1).

this region the bulk of the ground state is in a subspace which

In the case of the N -conﬁguration, besides Na the con-
stant of motion is the parity of the total number of exci-

M = A33 + A44 + ν1 + ν2 .

On may then deﬁne subspaces which preserve the parity
of M (even or odd) and ﬁnd the minimum energy values
Ee and Eo, respectively. The quantum ground energy
will then given by

Eg = min{Ee, Eo} .

(24)

For Na = 1 the ground state possesses an even parity
of M , i.e, Eg = Ee. As in the variational case (cf. Fig. 6),
the mode Ω1 dominates ((cid:104)ν1(cid:105) (cid:29) (cid:104)ν2(cid:105)) in the regions S13
and S24 while the mode Ω2 dominates ((cid:104)ν1(cid:105) (cid:28) (cid:104)ν2(cid:105)) in
the region S23.

Focusing our attention on the transition S13 (cid:42)(cid:41) S24,
where the mode Ω1 dominates, and using the same pa-
rameters as for the variational case, µ13 = 0.65 and µ23 =
0.25, we evaluate the expectation value of the number of
photons (cid:104)ν1(cid:105) and (cid:104)ν2(cid:105) as functions of µ24. Fig. 7(a) shows
a discontinuity in the expectation value of both (cid:104)ν1(cid:105) and
(cid:104)ν2(cid:105) at the transition, due to the fact that the critical
points in the separatrix form a Maxwell set. We also
calculate the atomic populations for the two 2-level sub-
systems, (cid:104)A11+A33(cid:105) and (cid:104)A22+A44(cid:105), shown in Fig. 7(b).
In the region S13 we have (cid:104)A11 + A33(cid:105) ≈ Na (= 1), i.e.,
the quantum ground state is practically the state of the
single subsystem of 2-levels formed by the ﬁrst and third
atomic levels, while in region S24 it corresponds to the
subsystem formed by the second and fourth atomic levels
(cid:104)A22 + A44(cid:105) ≈ Na. In other words, the transition in this
region is due to the change of excitations in the atomic
subsystem, in accordance with the variational calcula-
tion.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Two 4-level atomic conﬁgurations under dipolar in-
teraction with 2 modes of electromagnetic radiation,
viz., the λ- and N conﬁgurations, have been shown to
present qualitatively diﬀerent quantum phase diagrams.
Both conﬁgurations exhibit normal and collective (super-
radiant) regimes; while the latter in the λ-conﬁguration
divides itself into 2 subregions, corresponding to each of
the modes, that in the N -conﬁguration may be divided
into 2 or 3 subregions depending on whether the ﬁeld
modes divide the atomic system into 2 separate subsys-
tems or not. The quantum phase diagrams are obtained
by means of a variational procedure, which allows for an-
alytical expressions both for the critical variables and the
expectation values of the ﬁeld and matter operators, and
conﬁrmed through the exact quantum calculation (even
for a value of Na as low as 1).

FIG. 6.
(color online). Phase diagram for the 4-level sys-
tem in the N -conﬁguration interacting dipolarly with two
modes of electromagnetic ﬁeld (cf. Fig. 1). The normal re-
gion is shown in in black, and the collective region is divided
by a separatrix (blue surface), below which the mode Ω1
contributes to the atomic transitions, and above which the
mode Ω2 contributes. Further, the region where the mode
Ω1 dominates is itself divided by a separatrix (green surface)
which determines which of the 2 subsystems is excited. The
order of each transition is indicated. The parameters are
Ω1 = 1, Ω2 = 0.25, ω1 = 0, ω2 = 0.8, ω3 = 1 and ω4 = 1.9.

where the expressions for the diﬀerent Eij are valid when
ij − (ωj − ωi)Ω(cid:48) ≥ 0 is satisﬁed. In this expression Ω(cid:48)
4 µ2
stands for the corresponding mode. The minimum energy
surface is given by

Ev = min{EN , E13, E23, E24} .

(22)

The expressions for the energy are associated with the
reduction shown in Fig. 5. Enorm corresponds to c
i = 0,
i = 2, 3, 4. E13 is obtained by taking successively 4 = 0
and 2 = 0, arriving to 2-levels. Similarly, for E24 we
take 2 → ∞ and η3 = 0, while E23 may be obtained
following two paths, viz., 4 = 0 and 2 → ∞ or 2 → ∞
and η4 = 0.

The separatrix deﬁned by the set of values where
Enorm = Eij and Eij = Elm is shown in ﬁgure 6. The
normal region with Ev = Enorm, the collective regions
where Ev = Eij, and the order of transitions, are indi-
cated. One may observe that a second order transition
is had only for Snorm (cid:42)(cid:41) S13, and a ﬁrst order transi-
tion for other cases. Once again, the collective region is
divided into monochromatic subregions, and the region
where the mode Ω1 dominates is divided into two sub-
regions S13 and S24, each one corresponding to diﬀerent
subsystems of two levels.

The critical values of the Hamiltonian variables in each
region are given in Table III, and the relevant expecta-
tion values of the ﬁeld and matter observables calculated
from the variational states analytically are displayed in
Table IV.

The parameter space is divided into monochromatic
subregions Sij, each of which is dominated by a mode of
the radiation ﬁeld, in agreement with [17].
In general,
both ﬁrst and second order transitions for Snorm (cid:42)(cid:41) Sij
occur [14]. A ﬁrst order transition occurs when the
critical points along the separatrix form a Maxwell
set [17, 19]; a second-order transition is related to the
fact that the critical points form bifurcations.

It is interesting to note that for ﬁrst order transitions
we have discontinuities in the expectation values of the
photon number and atomic population operators. This
is also true for the N -conﬁguration for the transition
S13 (cid:42)(cid:41) S24 in spite of the fact that we have only one

mode. This is as consequence of the atomic population
shift from one 2-level subsystem to another.

In order to recover quantum correlations we need to
restore the symmetries of the corresponding Hamiltoni-
ans by acting with the parity operators on the variational
state, as it is usually done in many-body theories.
