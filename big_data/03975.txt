Abstract

To describe two-place physical problems, many possible models named Alice-Bob (AB) systems
are proposed. To ﬁnd and to solve these systems, the Parity (P), time reversal (T), charge conjugation
(C), shifted-parity (Ps, parity with a shift), delayed time reversal (Td, time reversal with a delay) and
their possible combinations such as PT, PC, PsC, PsTd and PsTdC etc. can be successively used.
Especially, some special types of Ps-Td-C group invariant multi-soliton solutions for the KdV-KP-
Toda type, mKdV-sG type and NLS type AB systems are explicitly constructed.

Introduction

Usually, physical models are locally established around a single place (around a single space-time point),
say, {x, t}. However, various physical problems may be happened in two or more places which are linked
each other, say, in quantum physics, two far away particles (for simplicity, we call them Alice and Bob
respectively) may be entangled each other. Whence the state of Alice, A(x, t), is given, the Bob’s state,

B(x′, t′) = ˆf A = Af ,

(1)
for suitable operator ˆf may be known at the same time. Usually, {x′, t′} is not neighbour to {x, t}.
Thus, the intrinsic two-place models, the Alice-Bob systems (ABSs), are nonlocal. Some special types
of this kind of nonlocal models have been proposed, say, the nonlocal nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations
(NLS) [10] with

ˆf = ˆP ˆC

where ˆP and ˆC are the usual parity and charge conjugation operators.

On the other hand, symmetries play essential roles in basic physical theories. For instance, the stan-
dard model is established by means of the SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1) symmetry and all the predictions of
the model have been completely proved such that 18 Nobel prizes are nominated to the scientists who
obtain great achievements on the model. Symmetries are not only the basic principles to established
physical models but also the key points to solve complicated scientiﬁc problems. Because the parity, time
reversal ( ˆT ), charge conjugation, space and time translations or their suitable combinations (say ˆP ˆC ˆT in
weak interaction processes) are conserved for most of basic physical problems. Almost all the important
nonlinear models possess these (or some of them) symmetries. Though these symmetries exist in vari-
ous physical models, they especially, the ˆP - ˆC- ˆT (parity and/or charge-conjugate and/or time-reversal)
symmetries are not directly used to solve nonlinear physical systems.

In this paper, we will reveal that these symmetries are not only very useful to established some
types of ABSs but also quite eﬀective to ﬁnd exact ˆP - ˆT - ˆC invariant solutions of ABSs. In section 2,
the ABSs are deﬁned in detail by introducing the AB-BA principle (AB-BA equivalence principle) and
the ˆPs- ˆTd- ˆC principle (shifted parity ( ˆPs) and/or delayed time reversal ( ˆTd) and/or Charge conjugate
invariance principle). Especially, various particular integrable ABSs such as the AB-KdV systems, AB-
MKdV systems, AB-KP systems, AB-NLS systems (the so-called nonlocal NLS model are included as
special cases), AB-sine Gordon systems and AB-Toda systems are listed. In section 3, using the ˆPs- ˆTd- ˆC
principle, the ˆPs- ˆTd- ˆC invariant multiple soliton solutions are explicitly obtained for various ABSs. The
last section is a short summary and discussion.

2 AB systems

2.1 AB-BA equivalence principle (AB-BA principle).

It is reasonable that Alice and Bob are in the equivalent situation which implies that Bob’s coordinate
system x′ ≡ {x′

i, i = 1, 2, . . . , n} should be related to that of Alice x ≡ {xi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n}, say,

Inversely, Alice’s coordinate system is related to that of Bob’s by

x′ = f (x) ≡ ˆf x.

x = f −1(x′) ≡ ˆf −1x.

(2)

(3)

Our equivalence principle requires that the function f and its inverse f −1 should have the same form. In
other words,

ˆf 2 = 1.

It is clear that there are inﬁnitely many solutions of (4), say, any solution of

F (x′, x) ± F (x, x′) = 0

solves (4) for arbitrary F . However, if we require further the space relation (2) (and then (3)) is only a
linear transformation, then the solutions of (4) can be completely ﬁxed.

For one dimensional transformation, there are only two linear transformation solutions of (4), the

identity transformation

(6)
and the shifted parity ( ˆPs) transformation for spatial variable or the delayed time reversal ( ˆTd) for time
variable

x′ = x (for space x), t′ = t (for time t),

(4)

(5)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

x′ = −x + x0 ≡ ˆPsx,

t′ = −t + t0 ≡ ˆTdt.

When x0 = 0, (t0 = 0), ˆPs ( ˆTd) is reduced back to the pure parity ˆP (time reversal ˆT ).

In two dimensional case, the allowed linear transformations of (4) possesses three cases,

where {i1, i2} = {1, 2} or {2, 1} and {a1, a2, x10} are arbitrary constants.

In three dimensional case, we have four cases,

the identity transformation

the shifted parity with arbitrary constants x10, x20 and x30

In (13) and (14), {i1, i2, i3} are any permutations of {1, 2, 3} i.e, {i1, i2, i3} = {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2},
{2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2} or {3, 2, 1} while {a1, a2, a3, a4, x10, x20} are arbitrary constants.

Using the above AB-BA equivalence principle, our most general AB systems have the form

CAB ≡(cid:26) G1(A, B) = 0,

G2(A, B) = 0,

B = Af = ˆf A

with the AB-BA equivalence condition

ˆf 2 = 1, x′ = ˆf x, x = ˆf x′

(15)

(16)

(17)

for suitable ˆf such as listed in (7), (9), (10), (12), (13), (14) and so on.

That means, an ABS is a coupled system CAB (15) which is consistent under the correlated condition

(16).

Because of the condition (17), the general coupled system (15) should be invariant under the transfor-

mation ˆf , i.e.,

ˆf CAB = CAB.

(18)

For physically signiﬁcance, in this paper, we only discuss the coupled system (15) is known in natural

science.

2.2 AB-KdV systems

In nonlinear physics, the KdV equation (A = A(x, t)) [1]

KdV ≡ At + Axxx + 6AAx = 0

(19)

is one of the most important and famous model which can be applied almost in all physical ﬁelds especially
in ﬂuid related branches [2].

The most general coupled homogeneous KdV system may have the form

4

CKdV ≡ 

= 

= 


where

x′x′x′ + (a3A + a4Bf )Ax − (a5A + a6Bf )Bf
x′x′x′ − (b3A + b4Bf )Ax + (b5A + b6Bf )Bf
x′x′x′ + (a3A + a4Bf )Ax − (a5A + a6Bf )Bf

At + a1Axxx − a2Bf

x′ + (b5Af + b6B)Bx = 0,
At + a1Axxx + a2B1xxx + (a3A + a4B1)Ax + (a6A + a7B1)B1x = 0,

x′x′x′ + b2Bxxx − (b3Af + b4B)Af

x′ = 0,
x′ = 0,

x′ = 0,

B1t + b1Axxx + b2B1xxx + (b3A + b4B1)Ax + (b5A + b6B1)B1x = 0,

A = A(x, t), Af = ˆf A = A(x′, t′), B = B(x, t), Bf = ˆf B = B(x′, t′) = B1(x, t),
x′ = ˆf x = −x + x0, t′ = ˆf t = −t + t0, ˆf = ˆPs ˆTd.

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

The general coupled KdV system possesses three equivalent expressions (20), (21) and (22). However,
the physical meanings of them are quite diﬀerent. The expression (22) is a usual single place nonlinear
model. The expression (20) describes the two-place nonlinear interaction between A(x, t) and B(x′, t′).
The expression (21) displays an interaction model between two-place quantities {A(x, t), B(x, t)} and
{A(x′ t′), B(x′, t′)}.

The general coupled one-place KdV system (22) has been studied in various literatures [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Its
possible integrable classiﬁcation has been done by general symmetry analysis, bi-Hamiltonian structure,
Painlev´e test and prolongation search on its Lax pairs. The model can also been derived from two layer
ﬂuids [3].

Because of the equivalence of (20), (21) and (22), it may be more interesting to ﬁnd some possible

two-place reductions which can not be equivalent to some one-place models.

It is fortunate that the special case of (21)

SCKdV ≡ 


At + a1Axxx − a2Bf
Bt − a2Af

allows an intrinsic two-place AB-KdV reduction

x′x′x′ + (a3A + a4Bf )Ax − (a6A + a7Bf )Bf

x′ = 0,

(24)

x′x′x′ + a1Bxxx − (a7Af + a6B)Af

x′ + (a4Af + a3B)Bx = 0,

ABKdV ≡ At + a1Axxx + a2Bxxx + (a3A + a4Af + a5)Ax + (a6A + a7Af + a8)Bx = 0,
B = Af = APsTd = A(−x + x0, −t + t0),

(25)

by directly taking B = A from (24).

Here we list four special concrete integrable realizations of (25).
The ﬁrst type of integrable AB-KdV reduction has the form

ABKdV1 ≡ At −

Axxx +

Bxxx − 3(A − B)Ax + 6ABx = 0, B = APsTd .

(26)

It is integrable because it can also be obtained from the reduction of Hirota-Satsuma system [9] and then
we can obtain its Lax pair

The second type of AB-KdV has the form

(29)
When {x′, t′} is changed as {x, t}, the ABKdV2 is reduced back to the known KdV equation. It is not
diﬃcult to prove that the AB-KdV model (29) is integrable with the Lax pair

ABKdV2 ≡ At + Axxx + 3(A + B)Ax = 0, B = ˆPs ˆTdA.

It is also interesting that, the fourth type of the AB-KdV system (35) possesses another Lax pair:

(38)

Finally, it is worth to emphasize that all the AB-KdV systems listed here possess the ˆPs ˆTd = ˆf
invariance and the source of the invariance comes from the invariance of the original coupled KdV (22)

ˆPs ˆTdCKdV = CKdV.

2.3 AB-NLS systems

Another ubiquitous nonlinear physical model is the so-called nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation

N LS ≡ iAt + Axx + σ|A|2A = 0,

σ = ±1.

(39)

(40)

Similar to the last subsection for the AB-KdV systems, to extend the NLS equation to possible two-place
AB models, we rewrite it as a special reduction of the AKNS system

−iB1t + B1xx + 2σB2

AKN S ≡ (cid:26) iAt + Axx + 2σA2B1 = 0,
= (cid:26) iAt + Axx + 2σA2BPs = 0,
−iBt + Bxx + 2σB2APs = 0,
= (cid:26) iAt + Axx + 2σA2BPS TdC = 0,
−iBt + Bxx + 2σB2APsTdC = 0.

1 A = 0,

(B1 = BPs),

(B1 = BPsTdC ),

(41)

(42)

(43)

Similar to the AB-KdV case, though the systems (41), (42), and (43) are equivalent, the physical meanings
of them are quite diﬀerent. Especially, their reductions related to B = AC = A∗ (or B1 = AC = A∗
for (41)) are completely diﬀerent. The reduction of (41) is just the well known NLS equation (40). The
reduction of (42) has the form

ABN LS1 ≡ iAt + Axx + 2σA2B = 0, B = APsC = ˆPs ˆCA = A∗(−x + x0, t).

(44)

When x0 = 0, the ABN LS1 (44) is just the so-called nonlocal NLS which was ﬁrst introduced by Ablowitz
and Musslimani [10]. The model (44) with x0 has been widely studied by many authors [11]. However,
it is still a new model for x0 6= 0.

The reduction of (43) has the form

ABN LS2 ≡ iAt + Axx + 2σA2B = 0, B = APsTd = ˆPs ˆTdA = A(−x + x0, −t + t0).

(45)

In our knowledge, the AB-NLS model (45) is also new. It is a really two-place nonlocal model though it
is reduced from a one-place coupled system.

All the models of this subsection are Ps invariant, TdC invariant and PsTdC invariant.
The integrability of the AB-NLS systems (44) and (45) is guaranteed by the integrability of the AKNS

system (41) with the well known Lax pair

A

−σB −λ (cid:19)(cid:18) ψ1

ψ2 (cid:19)x
(cid:18) ψ1
=(cid:18) λ
=(cid:18) 2iλ2 + iσAB
−iσ(2λB + Bx) −2iλ2 − iσAB (cid:19)(cid:18) ψ1

ψ2 (cid:19) ,

2iλA + iAx

ψ2 (cid:19) ,

ψ2 (cid:19)t
(cid:18) ψ1

(46)

(47)

where B = APsC = A∗(−x + x0, t) for ABN LS1 (44) and B = APsTd = A(−x + x0,−t + t0) for ABN LS2
(45).

2.4 AB-MKdV systems

The well known modiﬁed KdV equation (MKdV) can be written in the form

which is a natural reduction of the third order AKNS system,

M KdV ≡ At + Axxx + 6σA2Ax = 0,

σ = ±1,

by taking

AKN S3 ≡(cid:26) At + Axxx + 6AB1Ax = 0,

B1t + B1xxx + 6AB1B1x = 0,

B1 = σA.

It is clear that the one-place coupled model (49) possesses an equivalent two-place form

AKN S3 ≡(cid:26) At + Axxx + 6ABf Ax = 0, Bf ≡ B(−x + x0, −t + t0)

Bt + Bxxx + 6Af BBx = 0,

by taking

B1 = Bf .

7

(48)

(49)

(50)

Starting from the two-place form (50), one can readily obtain an intrinsic two-place AB-MKdV equation

ABM KdV ≡ At + Axxx + 6σABAx = 0, B = Af = ˆPs ˆTdA = A(−x + x0, −t + t0).

(51)

The model (51) is also a new model though a special case of (51) with x0 = 0 and t0 = 0 has been given
by Ji and Zhu [12].

The ABMKdV (51) is integrable because it is a reduction of the third order AKNS system. Thus its

Lax pair can be obtained from that of the AKNS system,

ψ2 (cid:19)x
(cid:18) ψ1

=(cid:18) −λ A

ψ2 (cid:19)
−σB λ (cid:19)(cid:18) ψ1

ψ2 (cid:19)t

4σλ2B + 2σλBx + σBxx + 2B2A −4λ3 − 2σλAB − σABx + BAx (cid:19)(cid:18) ψ1

ψ2 (cid:19) .

(52)

(53)

Many other types of intrinsic AB-MKdV system can be found from coupled MKdV systems, say, those

obtained from suitable Miura transforms of the AB-KdV systems [8].

2.5 AB-sine-Gordon equation

The well known sine-Gordon (sG) equation

is one of the most important integrable relativistic models which is widely used in the ﬁeld theory, optics
and condense matter physics. The sG model is also a special member of the AKNS hierarchy. Its general
coupled AKNS form can be written as (σ2 = 1)

sG ≡ Axt = sin(A)

(54)

ABsG ≡


Axt =(cid:16)σpa − sin(A) sin(B) + AxAt(cid:17) tan(A) + 1
Bxt =(cid:16)σpa − sin(A) sin(B) + BxBt(cid:17) tan(B) + 1

2

Though the coupled sG system (55) is one member of the AKNS hierarchy, it seems that the model have
not yet been explicitly written down elsewhere. In addition to the known sG (or sinh-Gordon) reduction

tan(A)Bt+tan(B)At

tan(A) tan(B)−a sec(A) sec(B) Ax,

When B = A and a = 1, the AB-sG system (58) return back to the usual sG system (54). There are
also many other types of AB-sG systems, say, the negative ones of the integrable AB-MKdV hierarchies.

For the AB-KP equation (67), the Lax pair possesses the same form as (68) and (69) but with B = Af
and (64) or (65) or (66).

In fact, for the coupled KP system (62), there exist some other complicated AB reductions if we take

other AB-BA equivalent coordinates such as those shown in (10), (13) and (14).

2.7 AB-Toda systems

The AB systems can also be established for discrete cases. In the discrete cases, one of the most important
model is the so-called Toda lattice which is equivalent to

T oda ≡ (An + 2)An,xx − A2

n,x +

1
2

(An + 2)2E2An−1 = 0,

where the diﬀerence operator E is deﬁned as

EAn = An+1 − An.

(71)

(72)

In order to ﬁnd some intrinsic two-place models, AB-Toda systems, we should extend the T oda system

(71) to some coupled ones.

3 Ps-Td-C invariant Multi-soliton solutions of the AB-systems.

In the last section, we have listed many new integrable two-place ABSs. Only two special cases, AB-NLS
system (44) with x0 = 0 and the complex AB-MKdV system (51) with x0 = t0 = 0, have been studied
by some authors.

Ablowitz and Musslimani have studied the singular multiple soliton solutions of the nonlocal focusing
equation (44) with x0 = 0 by using the inverse scattering transformation and Riemann-Hilbert problem
[10]. Analytical Dark and antidark soliton interaction solutions in the defocusing case of (44) with x0 = 0
have been obtained by Li and Xu [11]. The complex soliton solutions of (51) with x0 = t0 = 0 have been
obtained by Ji and Zhu with help of the Darboux transformations [12].

On the other hand, we know that symmetries of a nonlinear system can be used to ﬁnd new solutions
from known ones. The symmetry reduction method is used to ﬁnd solutions which are invariant under
the symmetry transformations.

In the last section, we have established some integrable systems via Ps-Td-C invariant principles. Thus,
a natural interesting question is that can we ﬁnd some exact solutions via the Ps-Td-C symmetries? .
Especially, can we ﬁnd Ps-Td-C invariant solutions? In the following subsections we list some Ps-Td-C
group invariant solutions for general ABSs including the integrable ones proposed in the last section.

3.1 PsTd-invariant multi-soliton solutions of the KdV-KP-Toda type AB sys-

tems

In this paper, we discuss only for the Ps-Td-C group invariant solutions, thus it is not necessary to restrict
whether the ABSs are integrable or not. We call the models

11

as the KdV-KP-Toda type ABSs if

where KdV , KP and T oda are deﬁned by (19), (61) and (71) respectively. Clearly, the AB-KdV, AB-KP

(83).

In this paper we restrict to study the ˆf -invariant solutions, i.e.,

(83) is equivalent to ﬁnding the ˆf invariant solutions of the usual KdV, KP and Toda equations.

For the usual KdV, KP and Toda systems, various exact solutions have been found by many authors.
Thus, the only thing we have to do is to select out the ˆf invariant solutions from the known ones of the
usual KdV, KP and Toda systems. Here, we study only for the multiple soliton solutions.

It is known that for the KdV (19), KP (61) and Toda (71), their known N -soliton solutions can be

uniformly written as

It is clear that the multiple soliton solutions (85) with (86) are not explicitly ˆf -invariant. To select
out the ˆf -invariant solutions from (85) with (86), we can use two facts, (i) {ξ0j, j = 1, 2, . . . , n} are
arbitrary constants, (ii) the solution (85) is invariant under the transformation

F → β exp(Kx + Ωt + X0)F

Though the expression (97) is equivalent to (85), it appears ﬁrst time in literature. For the expression

(85), some types of resonant singular solutions can be obtained by means of the limiting procedure

(103)
However, for the expression (97), the direct limiting procedure of (103) will lead to (N −1) soliton solution
because the transformation (96) moves all the possible resonant solutions to ∞. To re-ﬁnd the resonant
solutions, one has to readjust the constants η0j. In other words, if letting the constants η0j depending
on ki, i = 1, 2, . . . , N , one may obtain quite diﬀerent resonant solutions.

for the sG equation. Four expressions of (110) are equivalent by selecting suitable arbitrary constants
η0j and using periodic property of the triangular functions and hyperbolic functions.

In (110), we have used summations on non-dual odd (even) permutations (the permutations with odd
(even) numbers of νj = 1). We should add the permutation with zero number of νj = 1 to the even
permutations. For odd N (for odd number of solitons), even permutations νe and odd permutations νo
are dual each other, say, for N = 3,

νe = [ν1, ν2, ν3]e = {[−1,−1,−1], [1, 1,−1], [1,−1, 1], [−1, 1, 1]}
νo = [ν1, ν2, ν3]o = {[1, 1, 1], [−1,−1, 1], [−1, 1,−1], [1,−1,−1]} = νdual

e

.

(114)

For even N , νe and νo are completely diﬀerent and not dual, say, forN = 4, the non-dual even and odd
permutations possesses the forms

νo = [ν1, ν2, ν3, ν4]o = {[1,−1,−1,−1], [−1, 1,−1,−1], [−1,−1, 1,−1], [−1,−1,−1, 1]},

and

νe = [ν1, ν2, ν3, ν4]e = {[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1,−1,−1], [1,−1, 1,−1], [1,−1,−1, 1]},

respectively. The remained permutations are duals of (115) and (116).

From the expression (110) we know that

Af
η0j =0 = −Aη0j =0.

(115)

(116)

(117)

Thus the multiple soliton solutions Aη0j =0 i.e., (110) with η0j = 0 solve the MKdV-sG AB systems (82)
with (104) including (51) with σ = 1 and (58) with {a = δ = 1}.

G(A, B) = 0,

B = ˆPs ˆTdA = A(−x + x0,−t + t0), or B = ˆPsA = A(−x + x0, t)

G(A, A∗) = N LS,

and N LS being deﬁned by (40). It is clear that the integrable AB-NLS systems ABN LS1 and ABN LS2
expressed by (44) and (45) are just two explicit example of (118).

From the condition (119), we know that if A is a ˆPs ˆTd ˆC invariant solution of the usual NLS equation,

then it is also a solution for all general NLS type AB system (118) with ˆf = ˆPs ˆTd.

(120) should be done for all permutations µj = 0, 1, j = 1, 2, . . . , N .

Similar to the KdV-KP-Toda case, the N-soliton solution (120) can also be re-written to an elegant

From the expression (123) with (124) is ˆPs ˆTd ˆC invariant if φ′

0 = η0j = 0. Thus, from the condition
0=0 solve all the defocusing AB-NLS systems (118) with ˆf = ˆPs ˆTd. However,
(119) we know that Aη0j =φ′
for the defocusing AB-NLS (118) with ˆf = ˆPsC, we can not ﬁnd nontrivial multi-soliton solutions from
(123). The fact indicates that there may exist multi-soliton solutions which are ˆPs- ˆTd- ˆC symmetry
breaking. In fact, for the defocusing AB-NLS system (44) with x0 = 0, the authors of [11] have obtained
its ˆPs- ˆTd- ˆC symmetry breaking multi-soliton solutions via Darboux transformation.

It is clear that the solution (126) is not ˆPs- ˆTd- ˆC invariant for arbitrary ξ0j . Thus it is not a solution

of the general focusing NLS type AB system (118) with σ = 1.

As in the cases of the last two subsections, to ﬁnd ˆPs- ˆTd- ˆC invariant solutions from (126), the only

thing we have to do is to rewrite ξj as

One can prove that the solution (126) with (131) is PsTdC invariant for

η0j = 0

and PsC invariant if

η0j = kj − k∗

j = 0.

(131)

(132)

(133)

Thus the solution Aη0j =0 (i.e., (126) with (131) and (132)) solves the general focusing NLS AB system
(118) with {B = APsTd , σ = 1} and Aη0j =kj −k∗
k=0 (i.e., (126) with (131) and (133)) solves the general
focusing NLS AB system (118) with {B = APs , σ = 1}.
The expression (126) can also be expressed by means of hyperbolic and triangle functions to see explicit
ˆPs ˆTd ˆC invariants. However, we do dot write them down here because the ﬁnal result is much ugly than
(126).

As an example, we write down the N = 2 case to see the explicit ˆPs ˆTd ˆC invariance. For N = 2, the

solution (126) can be rewritten as (k1 ≡ k1r + ik1i, k2 ≡ k2r + ik2i)

From (134) with (135) and (136), it is straightforward to ﬁnd that AN =2 is ˆPs ˆTd ˆC invariant only for
η0j = 0, j = 1, 2 and ˆPs ˆC invariant if η0j = kj − k∗

j = 0, j = 1, 2.

4 Conclusions and discussions

In summary, various intrinsic two-place models, named Alice-Bob systems for convenience, are proposed
via AB equivalence principle and ˆPs- ˆTd- ˆC principle. All the ABSs are appeared ﬁrst time in this paper
except for two special cases, the AB-NLS (44) with x0 = 0 and the AB-MKdV (51) with x0 = t0 = 0.

Though the concept of the ABSs is ﬁrstly proposed in this paper, all the concrete ABSs listed in this

paper are reductions of known coupled systems.

In principle, we can extend all the known one-place physical model to some ABSs no mater it is
integrable or not. In this paper, many types of integrable systems such as the KdV, MKdV, KP, Toda,
sG and NLS equations are extended to some types of ABSs.

The ˆP - ˆT - ˆC principles are important in many physical ﬁelds and various physically important models
possesses P-T-C invariance. In this paper, the parity ˆP and time reversal ˆT is extended to shifted parity
ˆPs and delayed time reversal ˆTd. Thus, the ˆP - ˆT - ˆC principles are extended to ˆPs- ˆTd- ˆC principles.

The ˆPs- ˆTd- ˆC principles are used not only to establish ABSs but also to solve ABSs. Especially, some
types of multi-soliton solutions of many ABSs have been obtained from well-known integrable models via
ˆPs- ˆTd- ˆC principle. The ˆPs- ˆTd- ˆC invariant multiple soliton solutions are valid also for many nonintegrable
ABSs. For instance, the AB-KdV system, ABKdV expressed by (25), is not integrable for general ai,
however, its multiple soliton solution can be obtained in terms of (97) via a simple scaling procedure.

Though, we have obtained the ˆPs- ˆTd- ˆC invariant multiple soliton solutions of many ABSs, more
solutions of them are ˆPs- ˆTd- ˆC symmetry breaking. For instance, for the defocusing AB-NLS system (44)
with σ = −1 and x0 = 0, the ˆP -invariant solutions of the usual defocusing NLS are also the solutions
of the defocusing ABN LS1. Though we have not yet found the ˆP invariant solution of ABN LS1, there
really exist other types of multiple soliton solutions which are not ˆP -invariant [10, 11].

In [11], Li and Xu have obtained the explicit form of non-parity invariant multiple soliton solutions
of the defocusing ABAKN S1 with σ = −2 (where 2 can be scaled to 1) and x0 = 0 by means of the
Darboux transformation, say, the two soliton solution possesses the form [11]

A = |κ|e2i|κ|2t+iφ0(1 −

2κ1r(cid:0)γ + e−2κi(x+2κrt)(cid:1)(cid:0)κ∗γ∗ + κe2κi(x−2κrt)(cid:1)

|κ|2|γ|2 + |κ|2e−8κiκrt + κr(cid:0)κγe2κi(x−2κrt) + κ∗γ∗e−2κi(x+2κrt)(cid:1)

) ,

(137)

with complex constants κ ≡ κr + iκi and γ and the real constant φ0.

Thus, the following important questions should be studied in future: Are there any other types of
multiple soliton solutions which may be Ps-Td-C invariant or Ps-Td-C symmetry breaking for the AB
systems listed in this paper?

Another important question which should be studied further is can we establish other types of AB
systems with and without AB-BA equivalence principle? The answer is of course YES. Here, we just
write down a special AB-sG system by means of the AB-coordinate (10),

Axx − Ayy = 2 sin
