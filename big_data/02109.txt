Abstract

In a mesoscopic sample of a chiral p -wave superconductor, novel states comprising skyrmions and edge
states have been stabilized in out-of-plane applied magnetic ﬁeld. Using the time-dependent Ginzburg-
Landau equations we shed light on the dynamic response of such states to an external applied current.
Three diﬀerent regimes are obtained, namely, the superconducting (stationary), resistive (non-stationary)
and normal regime, similarly to conventional s-wave superconductors. However, in the resistive regime and
depending on the external current, we found that moving skyrmions and the edge state behave distinctly
diﬀerent from the conventional kinematic vortex, thereby providing new ﬁngerprints for identiﬁcation of
p -wave superconductivity.

1. Introduction

Edge states, appearing where the condensate ho-
mogeneity is broken, and domain walls, separat-
ing regions with diﬀerent chiralities, are the main
characteristics of chiral p -wave superconductivity
[1, 2]. They arise as a consequence of breaking the
time-reversal symmetry in an order parameter with
two components, i.e. ~Ψ = (ψ+, ψ−)T [3]. Besides
the edge states and the domain walls another topo-
logical entity (the skyrmion) has recently emerged
in chiral p -wave superconductivity [4]. Unlike the
Abrikosov vortex that has a core due to the dis-
continuity of its phase, the skyrmion is coreless and
deﬁned by a loop domain wall [5].

Chiral p -wave superconductivity is realized in
spin-triplet superconductors. In such materials two
electrons pair up forming a triplet rather than a sin-
glet as in conventional superconductivity. In order
to fulﬁl the Pauli principle, the orbital part in spin-
triplet superconductors has odd parity, i.e. angular
momentum L = 1 (p -wave). As a consequence of
the spin of the electronic pairs, another topologi-
cal entity, the half-quantum vortex (HQV), arises
in these materials. HQVs are expected to be un-
screened by the Meissner eﬀect due to their spin

currents, i.e. they are likely to be found at the lat-
eral borders of the sample [6].

Substantial evidence has been provided over the
years that strontium ruthenate, Sr2RuO4 (SRO),
is a chiral p -wave superconductor [7, 8, 9]. How-
ever, the lack of direct observation of states car-
rying spontaneous currents around space homo-
geneities undermines the candidacy of SRO to the
p -wave class of superconducting materials [10, 11].
In this work we study the electrical response of
skyrmions and edges states of a mesoscopic chi-
ral p -wave superconductor sample when an exter-
nal current is applied to the sample. Three dif-
ferent regimes are expected, as in conventional su-
perconductivity, namely superconducting, resistive
and normal regime. However, the temporal evolu-
tion of the two-component superconducting order
parameter (~Ψ) is found to provide rich physics, and
depending on the magnitude of applied-current, the
skyrmionic and edge states must present diﬀerent
behavior from kinematic vortices in conventional
superconductors [12, 13, 14]. This in turn provides
new possibilities for resistive stages in the sample
behavior, and indirect means to identify p -wave su-
perconductivity.

respectively. N, S, E and W stand for the cardinal
points. Current j is applied at contacts located at
N and S. Eq. (5) completes the TDGL equations
for chiral p -wave superconductors which we solve
using the ﬁnite-diﬀerence technique.

In this work we stabilize skyrmions and edge
states in a mesoscopic sample of size 10ξ× 12ξ by
applying an external magnetic ﬁeld H = 0.8Hc2 out
of plane of the sample. Although skyrmions can be
stabilized also in bulk samples [4], the edge states
containing one vortex just in component ψ+, i.e.
a half-quantum vortex for the system, appear only
where the space homogeneity is broken, thus are
characteristic of mesoscopic samples [5].
In what
follows, we examine the response of such states to
applied current. In our study, the external current
density j is increased adiabatically from zero up to
certain value jf , streaming from the north to the
south side of the sample.

The plot of voltage against current for a meso-
scopic chiral p -wave superconductor is shown in
Fig. 1, with the voltage deﬁned as: V = ¯ϕ|yi− ¯ϕ|yf ,
where the bar over the electrostatic potential de-
notes average, and yi = 1.5 ξ and yf = 10.5 ξ. To
date, for chiral p -wave superconductors only the
stationary GL equations have been derived either
phenomenologically or microscopically [3, 2, 15].
The TDGL equations (1) and (2), obtained as an
extension of the stationary ones after imposing full
gauge invariance are conceived for gapless super-
conductors, but are expected to capture the evolu-
tion of static and dynamic states in the here studied
cases.

Three diﬀerent regimes can be identiﬁed from the
current-voltage characteristics of Fig. 1, namely
the superconducting (stationary), resistive (non-
stationary), and normal (ohmic) regime. At low
currents the superconducting regime can exhibit
weak resistance, consequence of the normal contacts
(see the inset of Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows the supercon-
ducting phase at j = 0 in contour plots of |ψ+|2 (a),

where ϕ is the electrostatic potential, ~D = (~∇− i ~A)
is the covariant derivative, Π+(−) is the Landau
level creation (annihilation) operator, τ is a phe-
nomenological parameter, ˆσz is a Pauli matrix, κ is
the GL parameter, and ~Js is the superconducting
current density,

Figure 1: Measured voltage versus applied current in di-
mensionless units for a mesoscopic sample of size 10ξ ×12ξ
with normal contacts at north and south sides. An external
magnetic ﬁeld (H = 0.8Hc2) applied perpendicularly to the
sample stabilizes domain walls, skyrmions and half-quantum
vortices. Three diﬀerent regimes can be identiﬁed, namely
the superconducting (SC), resistive and normal regime (N).
The resistive regime contains diﬀerent states labelled here
by (a) - (g).

|ψ−|2 (b), the current density ~Js (c), and the cosine
of the intercomponent phase diﬀerence cos (θx−θy)
(d) [from now on simply call the phase diﬀerence].
The angular phases θx and θy are obtained from the
redeﬁned order parameters ψx = (ψ+ +ψ−)/2 and
ψy = (ψ+−ψ−)/2i, respectively. The superconduct-
ing state, according to panel (d) is composed of one
skyrmion inside the sample and the edge state en-
closing the sample and containing six HQVs at the
borders, and four domain walls around the corners.
As one increases the external current the super-
conducting state of Fig. 2 shifts to the right due
to the reduction of the superconducting currents
in the east side compared to the west side (due
to compensation of the Meissner currents with ap-
plied current, see e.g.
[16]). The resistive regime
thus appears at currents where the ﬂux motion
drives the superconductor to a non-stationary state.
From Fig.
1 one can see that such regime ex-
hibits sequential jumps in the voltage as current
is increased, which we attribute to diﬀerent non-
stationary states (labelled there by letters). In or-
der to study the temporal evolution of the two-
component superconducting order parameter in the
resistive regime, we choose the state a of Fig. 1
since it summarizes all the rich properties that a
mesoscopic chiral p -wave superconductor presents.

included).

The plot of Fig. 3(a) reveals that the voltage
in state a of Fig. 1 is a periodic function of time.
Moreover, one can clearly see that there exist three
distinct modes that correspond to a special ﬂux mo-
tion. Contour plots of the phase diﬀerence show
the superconducting state at these modes. From

panel (•) to ((cid:4)) one can distinguish three events:

(i) the bottom skyrmion is heading towards the E
side, (ii) one HQV at the E side left the sample
at the south-east corner, and (iii) one HQV at the
W side acquired a quantum of ﬂux from compo-
nent ψ− to form a full vortex. Next, the skyrmion
having two quanta of ﬂux broke into two HQVs
and one of these went to the E side while the other
fused with another quantum of ﬂux to form a sec-
ond full vortex [see panels ((cid:4)) and (N)]. Another
mechanism of skyrmion annihilation, displayed in
state f (see the supplementary section), consist of
one skyrmion losing its two quanta of ﬂux in the
form of two concentric HQVs. Finally, panels (N)
to (⋆) show the fusion of two full vortices into a

sides experience the easy direction for motion along
the superconducting-vacuum interfaces.

4. Conclusions

In summary, using the time-dependent Ginzburg-
Landau equations for chiral p -wave superconduc-
tors, we have shown some characteristic dynamics
of skyrmions and the edge state in a mesoscopic
p -wave superconductor. When an external current
is applied to the sample, the resistive state shows
much richer behavior compared to conventional s-
wave superconductors. For example, depending
on the strength of the external current, we found
that the half-quantum vortices in the edge state
can move along the direction of the applied cur-
rent, contrary to standard kinematic vortices which
always move perpendicularly to the current ﬂow
[12, 13, 14]. We also observe in the resistive regime
that under the applied current skyrmions either nu-
cleate the sample directly from the edge state or
arise from the recombination of two full vortices.
These ﬁndings combinatorially increase the possi-
bilities for diﬀerent resistive states in mesoscopic
superconductors, worthy of further exploration.

side from the west-south corner. There exists an-
other mechanism of skyrmion creation, consisting
of two quanta of ﬂux being pumped inside the sam-
ple from the edge state, more precisely the W side
(see the state f in the supplementary section).

The role of the normal contacts in the one di-
mensional movement of the HQVs is crucial. Ow-
ing to the superconducting-normal-metal interfaces
the barrier for HQV exit/entry is cancelled on the
N/S sides of the sample. Further, there also exists
a barrier formed by Meissner currents on the E/W
sides, that prevents the HQVs to leave the edge
state or conversely that prevent the HQV to get in
