Abstract

We consider the NMSSM extended to include one vector-like family of quarks and leptons.
If (some of) these vector-like matter particles, as the Higgs doublets, have Yukawa couplings
to the singlet S that exceed unity at about the same scale Λ (cid:46) 103 TeV, this gives the order
40% enhancement of the tree level Higgs boson mass required in the MSSM to reach 125 GeV.
It is conceivable that the Yukawa couplings to the singlet S, although naively blowing up close
to Λ, will not spoil gauge coupling uniﬁcation. In such a case the uniﬁed coupling αX could
be interestingly led to a value not far from unity, thus providing a possible explanation for the
number of generations. The characteristic signal is an enhanced resonant production of neutral
spin zero particles at LHC, that could even explain the putative diphoton resonance hinted by
the recent LHC data at 750 GeV.

Introduction

The success of the Standard Model leads to several key questions; in this paper we are motivated
by

• What determines the amount of matter; for example the number of generations NG?
• What determines the mass of the Higgs boson?
A possible answer to the ﬁrst question is that the value of the uniﬁed gauge coupling at mass
scales not far below the Planck scale is large, indicating the onset of semi-perturbative [1] and
even non-perturbative behavior [2–4]. In non-supersymmetric theories, with additional matter at
the TeV scale, this implies matter contributions to the Standard Model beta functions equivalent
to nine chiral generations, NG = 9. This could be arranged into three chiral generations and three
vector generations, but there are clearly many ways to arrange the new matter into complete
SU (5) multiplets.
In the Standard Model it is remarkable that the Higgs quartic coupling
vanishes at a scale of order 1011 GeV; suggesting a possible line of attack to understand the size
of the Higgs mass. However, the addition of extra matter at the TeV scale changes the evolution
of the quartic coupling removing the Higgs instability [5], so that some other understanding of
the Higgs mass is needed.

In theories with TeV scale supersymmetry, it is striking that if NG < 5 gauge coupling uniﬁ-
cation is highly perturbative, while with NG > 5 the gauge couplings become non-perturbative
at or below 1010 GeV, destroying the success of perturbative gauge coupling uniﬁcation. The
case of NG = 5 is uniquely selected, and leads to uniﬁcation at a scale of order 1017 GeV. There
are only two additions to the matter of the MSSM that yield such gauge running: one vector
generation, 10 + 10 + 5 + 5, and four copies of a vector fundamental 4(5 + 5).
In the MSSM the tree-level prediction for the Higgs boson mass is MZ| cos 2β|. As a zeroth
order result this is highly successful, and motivates a continued emphasis on TeV scale super-
symmetry. Of course, a key question becomes the origin of the order 40% enhancement required
to reach 125 GeV. One possibility is from loops of top squarks with a large mixing parameter;
another is the addition of a superpotential interaction coupling the two Higgs doublets to a
gauge singlet ﬁeld S, λSHuHd. If the theory is perturbative to uniﬁed scales then RG scaling in
the IR severely limits this contribution to the Higgs mass. On the other hand if S and/or Hu,d
are composites of some new interaction at scale Λ, as in Fat Higgs [6,7] and λ−susy [8] schemes,
the resulting contribution to the Higgs mass is typically (but not necessarily) too large, at least
if Λ < 108 GeV.
In this paper we study supersymmetric theories that have gauge coupling uniﬁcation with
NG = 5 and have S, Higgs and possible other states composite at scale Λ ∼ 10 − 103 TeV. We
stress that a brief energy interval with strong dynamics at Λ does not invalidate precision gauge
coupling uniﬁcation [9]. We are encouraged that in the Fat Higgs theory the constituents of the
Higgs doublets have the same contribution to the running of the electroweak gauge couplings as
the composites, Hu,d. Some of the vector matter may acquire mass at scale Λ, for example to
generate Yukawa couplings of the composite Higgs to quarks and leptons, but we assume that
much of it does not.

In the next section we deﬁne the theory below Λ and discuss its relevant parameters. In
Section 3 we give results for symmetry breaking and the Higgs spectrum.
In Section 4 we
demonstrate that the 750 GeV diphoton signal seen recently at the LHC can result from the
production of the pseudoscalar P , and in Section 5 we argue that production of S leads to a
ZZ signal that can be signiﬁcantly probed by running at

s = 13 − 14 TeV.

2 The Theory Below Λ

We take the eﬀective theory below Λ to be described by the scale invariant superpotential1

S3 ,

(1)

where WY uk are the Yukawa interactions of the Higgs doublets to quarks and leptons, and
(Φi, Φi) are multiplets of vector matter. For the numerical work, in the following we choose
these states to form one vector-like generation (10 + 10 + 5 + 5), and in the Conclusions, Sec. 6,
we mention how this may be consistent with gauge coupling uniﬁcation even if further vector
matter resides near Λ.

1In a concise but self-evident notation, gauge symmetry and matter parity also allow the couplings
HΦΦ, H ¯Φ ¯Φ, HΨΦ, SΨ ¯Φ, where Ψ is the standard matter 15-plet. Only the last two couplings are strongly
bound by ﬂavour. Their smallness may be attributed to separate parities of the Ψ and Φ ﬁelds.

a function of the scale of strong interactions, Λ, with λH,i(Λ) large.

A key feature of this theory is the renormalization group ﬂow of the couplings (λH, λi, κ).
With large boundary values at Λ, the couplings λH,i(E) rapidly become insensitive to the bound-
ary values and scale as 1/ ln(Λ/E) at E (cid:28) Λ. Fig. 1 shows λH,i(TeV) as a function of Λ. In
particular the large number of ﬁelds coupling to S insures that λH and λi drop faster in the
IR than does λ in the theory without (Φi, Φi), so that the Higgs mass enhancement is typically
of the required size, as illustrated by Fig. 2. The quantity mh0 is the smallest, purely doublet,
CP-even Higgs mass parameter, given by

Hv2 sin2 2β + ∆2

(2)

where ∆2
t is the loop contribution from virtual top quarks and squarks. Each band in Fig. 2
comes in part from the range in λi(Λ), the dominant eﬀect at Λ = 10 ÷ 100 TeV, and in part
from the range in ∆t = 75 ÷ 85 GeV, corresponding to an average stop mass between 1 and
2.5 TeV, and a mixing mass below 1 TeV. As we show in detail shortly, mixing with the singlet
scalar leads to a physical Higgs mass somewhat less than mh0.

In the MSSM, ignoring CP violation, there are four parameters that enter the electroweak
symmetry breaking sector, (µ; m2
d, B); after minimization the four independent parameters
can be taken to be (µ; v, tan β, mA). However, in addition three further parameters associated
with the top squark are needed to compute the Higgs mass. Assuming CP conservation, the
theory of (1), supplemented with the soft SUSY breaking terms deﬁned in the next Section,
has seven parameters associated with Higgs and S vevs, (λH, κ; m2
s, Aλ, Aκ), and these

translate into (λH, κ; v, tan β, vs, mA, mP ), with λH depending only logarithmically on Λ. For
small top squark mixing, the dominant contributions to the Higgs mass arise from these param-
eters; we explore the resulting prediction in detail, ﬁnding that Λ must be less than 103 TeV,
as is evident also from Fig. 2. The mass of the CP-even scalar in S, mS, is not an independent
parameter, but is given in terms of (vs, κ, mP ).

The masses of the Higgsinos and vector matter are given by µ = λHvs and Mi = λivs, with
ratios that are predicted and depend only on the gauge quantum numbers of Φi. In this paper
we take the supersymmetry breaking scale and hence vs to be order TeV. These masses are
therefore proportional to the couplings λH,i(1 TeV) shown in Fig. 1.

As shown in Fig. 2, the Higgs mass mh0 before doublet-singlet mixing depends predominantly,
other than tan β, on Λ, since λH(E) becomes rapidly insensitive to the boundary value. The
physical Higgs mass, as the entire scalar spectrum, however, crucially depends as well on the
other dimensionless parameter appearing in the superpotential term (κ/3)S3. Furthermore this
same term is what prevents the vev vs of the ﬁeld S from running to inﬁnity. As such the low
energy value of κ cannot be too small.

Fig. 3 shows the values at 1 TeV of κ and λH as functions of their initial values at Λ = 104, 105
GeV. Whereas the variation of λH(1 TeV) with the initial conditions is relatively weak even at
low values of Λ, this is not the case for κ(1 TeV), due to the cubic dependence on S of the
corresponding superpotential term. The renormalization of the S ﬁeld leads to κ decreasing in
the IR more rapidly than λH so that at the TeV scale it is typically smaller. As such κ(1 TeV)

entire Higgs potential and Higgs spectrum. From now on λH(1 TeV) and κ(1 TeV) are denoted
by λH and κ unless diﬀerently stated.

3 Symmetry Breaking and the Higgs Spectrum

The Higgs potential and Higgs spectrum are determined by the λH and the κ terms in the
superpotential, eq. (1), together with the soft SUSY-breaking potential, dependent on the cor-
responding scalar ﬁelds, for which we use the same notation

This potential is extensively studied in the literature [10, 11]. In a range of the parameters

it has a CP-conserving SU (2) × U (1)-breaking minimum. For our purposes the physical Higgs
spectrum and the relevant mixing angles are more eﬀectively described in terms of a diﬀerent
choice of parameters (λH, κ; v, tan β, vs) and two physical masses themselves: mA, mP , with A
and P the two neutral CP-odd scalars.

vs close to 1 TeV, as positive evidence for the model under consideration.

4 Putative 750 GeV Diphoton Signal
At least for the states S and P , which are predominantly singlets under SU (2) × U (1), a clear
consequence of the picture described so far is an enhanced resonant production at the LHC
through the gluon-fusion channel, as shown in Fig.
5 for the CP-odd state P , obtained by
rescaling the NNLO QCD cross section of a SM-like Higgs from Ref. [12]. This suggests to take
the putative resonance hinted by the recent LHC data at 750 GeV [13,14] as an illustrative case.
This result received an overwhelming response from the theoretical community, and a large
number of preprints appeared on the subject3.
In particular, among the ﬁrst works which
provided a combination of the experimental results, as well as interpretations in a selection
of simple models relevant to our case, were Refs. [24–32]. The ﬁts in these works show that
assuming production via gluon fusion and combining LHC data from Run-1 and Run-2 gives a
rate for the diphoton signal at 13 TeV between approximately 3 and 10 fb. For deﬁniteness, in
the following we use the result of Ref. [24]:

µ13 TeV(γγ) = (4.6 ± 1.2) fb .

(11)

3To our knowledge, the model studied in Ref. [15], that considers the possibility of interpreting the putative
resonance at 750 GeV in the NMSSM with vector-matter as a P -like state decaying into two photons, is the
closest to our analysis. Diﬀerent NMSSM scenarios were studied at least in [16, 17]. In the context of the MSSM
with an extra singlet, Refs. [15,18–20] consider extra vector-like matter in SU (5) multiplets while a single vector-
like quark is added in Ref. [21]. Ref. [22] studies the excess in the context of E6 uniﬁcation, and Ref. [23] aims
at describing the signal without extra matter.

gg), for diﬀerent values of Λ (with λi(Λ) = 1.5). Also shown are the 1σ and 2σ bands of the
estimated diphoton signal.

In the present context the gluon-gluon production cross section for the S state is similar to
the one for P , only rescaled down by about a factor of 9
4. What diﬀers between S and P are their
Branching Ratios, since the opposite CP-nature allows only in the S case a tree level coupling
to the W W, ZZ, hh pairs. The CP-odd state is therefore favorite to have a sizable Branching
Ratio in γγ, with t¯t only as competing channel.
Taking mP = 750 GeV, the width Γ(P → γγ) depends in principle on the λH,i and on the
masses Mf = (µ, Mi) = λH,ivs, hence on vs and Λ. The dependence on Λ, however, is relatively
weak, since for 2Mf (cid:29) mP the width goes as λ2
f , and the dependence on the couplings
drops away. In Fig. 6 we show the signal µ(pp → P → γγ) at 13 TeV, divided by B(P → gg),
a combination which only depends on Γ(P → γγ). In turn we show in Fig. 7 B(P → gg) itself,
which can deviate from one only due to the competition from

This width, hence B(P → gg), is controlled by θP , eq. (6), which depends on a set of
parameters constrained by mh = 125 GeV, as shown in Fig. 4. In these ﬁgures, the two possible
values of mA which reproduce the correct Higgs mass correspond to the two solutions represented
in Fig. 7. The dark region in Fig. 7 (right) corresponds to sin θP > 0.3, that goes beyond the
approximation for small v/vs.
As evident from this ﬁgure, the decay P → t¯t plays a limited role and only in a small corner
of the parameter space. Therefore, Fig. 6 shows that the P state could account for the signal at

750 GeV with the estimated rate in eq. (11) for vs ∼ 0.8 ÷ 1.2 TeV. The total width of the P
state never exceeds 100 MeV. This prediction of our model is in some tension with the ATLAS
13 TeV diphoton analysis [13], which shows a mild preference for a large-width Γ ∼ 45 GeV.
Even though it is still too early to draw deﬁnite conclusions on such properties of the excess,
our model could be refuted if the resonance at 750 GeV were conﬁrmed with a large width in
future analyses.

5 The W W and ZZ Signal

As anticipated, the CP-even state S is broader due to its decays into a pair of W W, ZZ, hh,

This may clearly give rise to another interesting signal. One may actually wonder if data

TeV-scale supersymmetry gives a leading contribution to the Higgs mass of about MZ. In this
paper we have demonstrated that the required enhancement to 125 GeV, arising from the SHuHd
coupling and from S/H mixing, is typical in the NMSSM with a scale-invariant superpotential
and a generation of vector matter, as shown in Figs. 2 and 4. The couplings of vector matter
and Higgs to the singlet ﬁeld become large at a scale Λ <∼ 103 TeV, leading to a highly predictive
spectrum of Higgs and vector matter states at the scale of the singlet vev, taken to be (cid:39) 1 TeV.
Loops of vector matter lead to an enhanced production rate of the pseudoscalar P and the
scalar S that are dominantly electroweak singlets, so that signals are expected at the LHC.
Fig. 6 shows that the observed 750 GeV diphoton excess arises from P production if the singlet
vev is (cid:39) 1 TeV, and Fig. 7 shows that a signiﬁcant signal for P → ¯tt may be present in part of
parameter space. Most important is that S/H mixing, required for the Higgs mass, leads to a
large signal for S → ZZ, W W . As shown in Fig. 8, bounds from Run 1 exclude some parameter

space for mS < 1 TeV, and data at
The masses of vector matter, with ratios only dependent on the gauge quantum numbers (at
least for moderate HΦΦ, H ¯Φ ¯Φ couplings), lie in the TeV range. With mP = 750 GeV quarks
are between 0.8 and 1.5 TeV and leptons between 0.6 and 1 TeV. The heavier states cascade
to the lighter ones, which ultimately decay promptly to standard quarks and leptons with the
emission of W, Z, and h.

The results summarized above are insensitive to the amount of vector matter below Λ, as
long as it is substantial. Our numerical results are for the case of a vector generation at the
TeV scale, but adding further multiplets yields the same phenomenology with a rescaled Λ. The
case of perturbative gauge coupling uniﬁcation with a single vector generation is particularly
interesting, since only in this case is the amount of matter determined by an order unity uniﬁed
gauge coupling. However, although non-perturbative physics at Λ yielding composite states
can be made consistent with gauge coupling uniﬁcation, some vector matter is required near Λ,
leaving less than a generation below Λ. We note that if the strong dynamics were conformal
above Λ, with SU(5) as a global symmetry, precise gauge coupling uniﬁcation might occur where
the uniﬁed coupling becomes order unity with more than 1 generation of vector matter. All of
this requires further study to be made concrete.
