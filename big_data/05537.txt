Abstract. We discuss the soundness of inﬂationary scenarios in theories beyond the
Starobinsky model, namely a class of theories described by arbitrary functions of the Ricci
scalar and the K-essence ﬁeld. We discuss the pathologies associated with higher-order equa-
tions of motion which will be shown to constrain the stability of this class of theories. We
provide a general framework to calculate the slow-roll parameters and the corresponding
mappings to the theory parameters. For paradigmatic gravitational models within the class
of theories under consideration we illustrate the power of the Planck/Bicep2 latest results
to constrain such gravitational Lagrangians. Finally, bounds for potential deviations from
Starobinsky-like inﬂation are derived.

A key question to be addressed in gravitational physics and suggested extensions to General
Relativity (GR) resides in the coupling of gravity and matter ﬁelds.
In this respect, the
assumption of the Equivalence Principle and consequently, the minimal coupling between
matter and geometry as dictated by Einsteinian gravity, although supported by both astro-
physical tests and laboratory experiments, may suﬀer from violations in spacetime scales
where experiments are neither conclusive enough nor have never been performed. Indeed,
the Einstein Equivalence Principle is a fundamental milestone of the GR theory. While
this principle has been thoroughly tested with standard matter, the question of its validity
in the dark sector remains open. The existing literature has considered various forms of
non-minimal couplings [1] such as those provided by scalar-tensor theories [2], vector-tensor
theories [3], diﬀerent couplings between matter and geometry [4], and even couplings of a
function of the Ricci scalar R to the matter Lagrangian (c.f. [5–9] and references therein).
A recent line of research has also considered Lagrangians which depend both on the Ricci
curvature and on the trace of the energy-momentum tensor T = T µ
µ. Originally introduced
in [10] and later in [11], some cosmological aspects have been already explored for these kinds
of theories, such as the reconstruction of cosmological solutions [12, 13] and other issues on
energy conditions, thermodynamics and singularities [14–16]. However, theories with non
standard couplings between the geometry and the matter Lagrangian usually fail to conserve
the energy-momentum tensor, which implies a stringent shortcoming for their viability [17].
Another kind of theory under scrutiny in the recent years also included terms of the form
Rµν T µν [7, 8, 18]. Finally, a recent proposal in [19] has claimed that in the case of a violation
of the Equivalence Principle, data favour violations through coupling strengths showing op-
posite signs for ordinary and dark matter, although the analysis therein does not show any
signiﬁcant deviations from GR.

These diﬀerent types of couplings, if intended to depict a well-founded theory describing
the gravitational interaction, must be free of undesirable instabilities such as the appearance

– 1 –

of ghost-like modes and the exponential growth of perturbations around well-established
spacetime backgrounds, among others. For instance, the avoidance of the Dolgov-Kawasaki
instability has been developed to constrain the extensively studied f (R) gravity with mini-
mal [20–24] and non-minimal couplings of the curvature with matter [25]. Another important
requirement usually demanded to extended theories consists of the avoidance of the Ostro-
gradski instability, which appears in Hamiltonians associated with Lagrangians depending
on more than one time derivative non-degenerately [26, 27]. As a consequence, such Hamil-
tonians turn out not to be bounded from below and well-deﬁned vacuum states are absent.
However, theories with higher-order equations of motion can be sensible provided they are
regarded in the context of eﬀective ﬁeld theories, where operators leading to the higher-order
equations of motion comprise the ﬁrst terms of some expansion whose adequate resumma-
tion might give rise to well-behaved theories. Another possibility to make sense of theories
with higher-order equations of motion is to remove the undesired unstable degrees of free-
dom from the physical spectrum of the theory or, at the classical level, to constrain the
physically allowed set of boundary conditions. However, one needs to make sure that such
a procedure does not get spoiled by either time-evolution or coupling to other ﬁelds. This
approach was followed in [28] for the case of the degenerate Pais-Uhlenbeck ﬁeld. A widely
accepted way of circumventing the Ostrogradski instability when considering scalar-tensor
theories of gravitation, consists of requiring the Euler-Lagrange equations to be second order
even if higher-order derivatives are present in the action. Following this line of reasoning,
Horndeski’s theorem [29] provides the most general Lagrangian density for a scalar-tensor
theory which guarantees second-order Euler-Lagrange equations. Nonetheless, recent pro-
posals have ensured second order equations of motion and hence the absence of Ostrogradski
ghost degrees of freedom for theories which do not fall under the form of Horndeski-like the-
ories (c.f. [30–34] and references therein for recent proposals).

In this paper we shall focus on theories presenting a general coupling through an arbi-
trary function between the Ricci scalar curvature R and a calar ﬁeld given by a K-essence
model, the latter including in principle both a kinetic and a potential term. Arbitrary theories
of the Ricci scalar only, widely known as f (R) theories might be thought of as the only local,
metric-based and generally coordinate invariant and stable modiﬁcations of gravity [27, 33].
When rearranged in the scalar-tensor equivalent picture by the introduction of an auxiliary
scalar ﬁeld, those theories prove to be free from Ostrogradski instability. Moreover, both
viability and stability conditions for f (R) theories have been widely studied and guarantee
the attractive character, the aforementioned avoidance of the Dolgov-Kawasaki instability,
and the agreement with solar system tests and evolution of geodesics [35]. f (R) theories have
in fact proved extremely successful in describing the cosmological evolution, being able to
provide a complete picture of the behaviour of the Universe (c.f. [24, 36, 37]) accounting for
the dark matter component [38, 39], the growth of large-scale structures [40] and to provide
a mechanism for cosmological inﬂation through, for instance, the Starobinsky inﬂationary
model [41, 42], which is constructed with an extra term to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian
of the form f (R) = R2. Other recent proposals have been scrutinised in [43–45]. One is
then tempted to consider general theories of the Ricci scalar with some kind of coupling to
an extra scalar ﬁeld in order to observe potential eﬀects distinguishable from the standard
f (R) counterpart predictions. In particular, the scalar ﬁeld might be interpreted either as
an eﬀective ﬁeld theory remnant from an underlying theory or the inﬂaton ﬁeld as it shall
be the case below. Namely, in the following we shall focus our attention on the inﬂationary

– 2 –

epoch and our goal throughout the paper will be twofold: on the one hand, we shall study
how to reconstruct a given inﬂationary Hubble parameter for classes of gravitational models
of the sort described above; on the other hand, we shall determine how deviations from the
Starobinsky inﬂationary scenario when an extra scalar ﬁeld is introduced can be identiﬁed, or
in other words, how certain the claim that Starobinsky inﬂation is in fact the model behind
the observed slow-roll parameters may be.

Slow-roll inﬂation is usually described by a single scalar ﬁeld, where the desirable fea-
tures can be achieved by the appropriate scalar potential [46, 47]. However, while considering
several scalar ﬁelds, slow-roll inﬂation can be also reproduced. In this sense, modiﬁcations
studied herein will be analysed in the Einstein frame, where our theory turns out precisely to
be interpreted as a multiﬁeld inﬂationary model. As well known, in the multiﬁeld inﬂation
paradigm the conservation of the curvature perturbation is not ensured at scales beyond the
horizon, but eventual conservation depends on the evolution of the several scalar ﬁelds, in-
ducing isocurvature modes (c.f. Refs.[48]-[52]). However, the spectral index for the adiabatic
modes can be analytically obtained [48, 49].
In addition, even if isocurvature modes are
created, they may become adiabatic when the Universe reaches thermal equilibrium [51]. In
addition, tools for calculating and constraining multiﬁeld inﬂation has been developed, being
so far in good agreement with the observational constraints [52]. In the following we shall
analyse some modiﬁcations of Starobinsky R2 inﬂationary model which imply the emergence
of a multiﬁeld picture, where the spectral index and the scalar-to-tensor ratio can be studied.

The paper is structured as follows: in Sec. 2 we present some generalities of the theories
under consideration. Therein we include the multi-scalar representation, which allows us to
identify the potential instabilities in a transparent way. Then, we perform the conformal
transformation to the Einstein frame in order to express the gravitational sector in a more
convenient way. At the end of the Section we write the ﬁeld equations in a cosmological
spatially ﬂat Robertson-Walker geometry that will be used in the following. In Sec. 3 we will
focus on the inﬂationary slow-roll paradigm and we recast the inﬂationary slow-roll param-
eters in terms of the Hubble parameter and its derivatives, which allows us to express such
parameters in terms of the cosmological evolution as provided by the gravitational modelss
considered. Immediately after that, in Sec. 4 we will apply the technique developed in the
previous Section to two diﬀerent parameterisations for the Hubble rate at the inﬂationary
epoch. We illustrate the results using two paradigmatic gravitational models, one in Sec. 4.1
with a multiplicative coupling between the curvature and the K-essence ﬁeld and a second
one in Sec. 4.2 with the addition of an arbitrary function of the Ricci curvature and another
function of the K-essence scalar ﬁeld. In Sec. 5 we perform a thorough study on two pos-
sible functional deviations from the standard Starobinsky model as originated by arbitrary
functions of a K-essence scalar ﬁeld. Finally, Sec. 6 contains the main conclusions of the
paper.

f (R, ξ) gravity

Let us start by introducing the general scalar-tensor model to be discussed in this manuscript.
The gravitational action is expressed as follows

S =Z d4x√−g(cid:2)f (R, ξ) + 2κ2Lm(cid:3) ,

(2.1)

– 3 –

2 ∂µφ∂µφ−V (φ) that just
where κ2 = 8πG, G is the standard gravitational constant and ξ ≡ − 1
by itself represents the Lagrangian of a canonical scalar ﬁeld. This kind of action generalises
the usual scalar-tensor theories, such as Brans-Dicke-like or K-essence theories. Then, by
varying the action with respect to the metric gµν and the scalar ﬁeld φ, the corresponding
ﬁeld equations are obtained, yielding

fξ∇µφ∇νφ = κ2Tµν ,

2

∇µ (fξ∇µφ) − fξV (φ) = 0 .

(2.2)

Here the subscripts refer to derivatives with respect to R and ξ. As in other extensions of
GR, the action (2.1) may be expressed in terms of two auxiliary scalar ﬁelds {ϕ, ψ} as follows

S =Z d4x√−g(cid:2)ϕR + ψξ − Q(ϕ, ψ) + 2κ2Lm(cid:3) .

Varying the action (2.3) with respect to ϕ and ψ, respectively, yields

(2.3)

ξ −

= 0 → ϕ = ϕ(R, ξ) , ψ = ψ(R, ξ) .

(2.4)

where the last two expressions rely on the possibility of inverting the partial derivatives of
Q [7]. Usually explicit expressions for ϕ and ψ are not found, but numerical ones are always
reachable provided det

∂2f
∂χi∂χj 6= 0 with χi=1,2 = {ϕ, ψ} [7]. Thus, expressions

ϕ = fR , ψ = fξ , Q(ϕ, ψ) = fRR + fξξ − f

and consequently

f (R, ξ) = ϕR + ψξ − Q(ϕ, ψ) .

(2.5)

(2.6)

turn the form of action (2.3) back to the original one (2.1). Hence, we have sketched how the
gravitational action (2.1) can be expressed through (2.3) as a scalar-tensor theory with two
additional scalar ﬁelds {ϕ, ψ}, non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar and the original
scalar ﬁeld φ, respectively. The fact that action can be rewritten in the form (2.3) guarantees
the absence of the Ostrogradski’s instability for such theories1. Thus, once the action is
written in the scalar-tensor form (2.6), the latter action can be further transformed into the
so-called Einstein frame, where the couplings in the curvature sector recover the usual form
of the Einstein-Hilbert action. Hence, by applying the conformal transformation:

˜gµν = Ω2gµν where Ω2 = ϕ ,

the action (2.3) yields

˜S =Z d4xp−˜g" ˜R

(2.7)

(2.8)

1A complementary way to check the absence of Ostrogradski’s instability is to consider that f (R) theories
are instability-free [7], therefore only the ﬁeld ξ can be problematic but an analogous process as the one
exempliﬁed in (2.3) only for the ξ ﬁeld leads to the same conclusion

(2.9)
Then, action f (R, ξ), when mapped into the Einstein frame, can be recast as a standard
Einstein-Hilbert term2 plus a K-essence contribution supplemented by two auxiliary coupled
scalar ﬁelds { ˜ϕ, ψ}, which do couple to each other through functions P and ˜Q. On the other
hand, there is a coupling of the aforementioned ﬁelds with ˜ξ, which appears multiplying the
P function in (2.8).

In order to illustrate the power of the above procedure, let us consider a special case
In such case, ϕ and ψ coincide

where calculations become simpler, f (R, ξ) = f (R + ξ).
according to Eq. (2.5) and the action (2.3) becomes

S =Z d4x√−g(cid:2)ϕ(R + ξ) − Q(ϕ) + 2κ2Lm(cid:3) .

There, once the conformal transformation (2.7) is applied, one gets

Thus as can be seen from the ˜ξ deﬁnition in (2.9), provided there is no scalar potential V (φ)
in the original action, the couplings between the scalar ﬁelds {φ, ˜ϕ} and the Ricci scalar ˜R
turn out to be minimal3 when expressing the Lagrangian f (R + ξ) in the Einstein frame as
we did in (2.11). This result has been widely studied in previous literature as it provides
interesting properties and reproduces the late-time acceleration, although usually at the ex-
pense of having to suﬀer from a smooth phantom transition (c.f. Ref. [47]).

2.1 Cosmological Evolution

Let us now turn back to the original equations (2.2) and consider a spatially ﬂat Friedmann-
Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric,

ds2 = −dt2 + a(t)2d~r 2

(2.12)

Here, as usual a(t) is the scale factor and the in the following the Hubble parameter H ≡ ˙a/a
with the dot expressing derivative with respect to the cosmic time t. Then, introducing this
metric in the ﬁeld equations (2.2), the FLRW equations for the theory (2.1) for a perfect
ﬂuid with density and pressure ρm and pm respectively, yield

(2.13)

2Although as usual in the Einstein frame, the price to pay is the non-minimal coupling between matter

and geometry as seen in the last term of (2.8).

3Once again the non-minimal coupling with matter survives, as seen in the last term of (2.11).

– 5 –

For the purposes of the paper, let us express the FLRW equations (2.13) in terms of the
number of e-folds N ≡ log a
instead of the cosmic time t, which shall prove more convenient
in the following. Then, equations turn into

where the prime denotes derivative with respect to the number of e-folds N . Hence, by using
Eqs. (2.14) above and assuming a particular Hubble parameter evolution H = H(N ), the
corresponding Lagrangian f (R, ξ) can be in principle reconstructed. In addition, we are now
able to relate the underlying theory and the inﬂationary parameters, assuming the validity
of slow-roll inﬂation, as will be shown in the upcoming section.

(2.14)

3 Slow-roll inﬂation in f (R, ξ) gravity: inﬂationary parameters

Let us start by brieﬂy reviewing the basic properties of slow-roll inﬂation by using the most
common model, i.e., a single non-minimally coupled scalar ﬁeld whose Lagrangian is given
by

Sφ =Z d4x√−g(cid:20)−

1
2

∂µφ∂µφ − V (φ)(cid:21) ,

(3.1)

By assuming the spatially ﬂat FLRW metric (2.12), the equations describing the dynamics
of the Universe evolution are

(3.2)

(3.3)

Note that adequate combinations of the FLRW Eqs. (3.2) together with the assumption of
a particular Hubble parameter H(N ), easily provide the corresponding inﬂaton model, as
obtained from action (3.1), namely [47]

2H′(φ)
κ2H(φ)

,

ω(φ) = −
1

V (φ) =

κ2 h3 (H(φ))2 + H(φ)H′(φ)i .

(3.4)

Here we have redeﬁned the scalar ﬁeld as φ = N and ω(φ) refers to the kinetic factor
that one needs to introduce to recast the kinetic term as in (3.1). Let us now obtain the
corresponding observables in terms of the model (3.1). In slow-roll inﬂation, the scalar ﬁeld
behaves approximately as an eﬀective cosmological constant, since

H ˙φ ≫ ¨φ , V ≫ ˙φ2 .

(3.5)

– 6 –

This basically means that the friction term in (3.3) dominates, the Hubble parameter being
approximately constant, H ∼ H0. After an enough number of e-folds (around N = 50 − 65),
the scalar ﬁeld φ rolls down the potential slope while the kinetic term of the scalar ﬁeld
increases and eventually dominates over the potential. Thus the ﬁeld continues oscillating
around the minimum of the potential, emitting particles and consequently reheating the
Universe. One of the most relevant consequences of inﬂation is the fast growth of the scalar
and tensor ﬂuctuations produced during inﬂation, which then form the seeds of large-scale
structures. Such ﬂuctuations have a characteristic amplitude and scale dependence which
under the slow-roll approximation, are related to the so-called slow-roll parameters deﬁned
as follows

.

(3.6)

Here the primes refer to derivatives with respect to the scalar ﬁeld φ. During inﬂation, the
quantities in (3.6) are small enough in order to expand the required number of e-folds, namely
ǫ ≪ 1 and η < 1. At the end of inﬂation, ǫ & 1. Then, for the above inﬂationary model
(3.1) the spectral index ns of the curvature perturbations, the tensor-to-scalar ratio r of the
density perturbations, and the running of the spectral index αs can be written in terms of
the slow-roll parameters as follows

ns − 1 = −6ǫ + 2η ,

r = 16ǫ , αs =

dns
d log k ∼ 16ǫη − 24ǫ2 − 2ξ2 .

(3.7)

Hence, by using the recent constraints provided by the Planck and Bicep2 collaborations every
slow-roll inﬂationary model can be scrutinised against observational results (see Ref. [42]).
Similarly, the slow-roll parameters can be expressed in terms of the Hubble parameter by
using Eqs. (3.4), which leads to [44]

where let’s keep in mind that throughout the paper prime shall denote derivative with respect
to φ ≡ N . Turning back to the more general scalar-tensor Lagrangian (2.1) and using the
equations of motion (2.14), the Hubble parameter and its derivatives with respect to the
number of e-foldings can be expressed solely in terms of the gravitational Lagrangian f (R, ξ)

Here the prime denotes derivatives with respect to the number of e-foldings N . Then, the
slow-roll parameters (3.8) can be expressed in terms of the Lagrangian f (R, ξ), in analogy
to the case of single ﬁeld inﬂation (3.6). The explicit expressions of the slow-roll parameters
(3.8) can be then expressed in terms of the gravitational action (2.1) by using (3.9). For
the sake of clarity, we omit those expressions here. Hence, by following the sketched proce-
dure, the corresponding observational parameters are obtained. In addition, the Lagrangian
(2.1) can be reconstructed when considering a particular inﬂationary model which can be
fully described by the Hubble parameter H(N ). Thus, in the following section we shall
consider several inﬂationary models and study the possibility that they are being driven by
paradigmatic forms of the gravitational Lagrangian (2.1).

4 Reconstruction and Inﬂationary constraints of f (R, ξ) gravity

In order to reconstruct f (R, ξ) Lagrangians as provided by a given cosmological expansion
history, let us consider some particular classes of such models. Thus, in the following Sections
4.1 and 4.2 we shall consider two paradigmatic examples illustrating the reconstruction pro-
cedure. For each of them we shall obtain parameters constraints using slow-roll parameters
bounds as provided by Planck and Bicep2 collaborations latest data.

4.1

f (R, ξ) = α(ξ)R Model

Let us ﬁrst consider a class of models with an arbitrary function α(ξ) coupled to the standard
Einstein-Hilbert gravitational Lagrangian proportional to the Ricci curvature, R,

f (R, ξ) = α(ξ)R .

(4.1)

One can easily understand that, provided α is analytic at ξ = 0, such Lagrangian can be
expanded as f (R, ξ) ≈ α(0)R + αξ(0)ξR + 1
2 α2ξ(0)ξ2R +O(ξ3R), so that the leading term for
the non-minimal coupling can be thought as ξR. Thus, for the Lagrangian (4.1), the FLRW
equations (2.14) become

3α(ξ)H 2 =

.

(4.2)

Note that the second equation in (4.2) is actually a diﬀerential equation for α(ξ(N )) = α(N )

After having solved the equation above for α(N ), the corresponding scalar ﬁeld sector, i.e.,
the scalar ﬁeld φ evolution, can be fully reconstructed using the ﬁrst FLRW equation in (4.2),
yielding

αξφ′2 =

where one ﬁrst needs to specify a form of α(ξ). For instance, for a linear dependence such as
2 ∂µφ∂µφ − V (φ), and after redeﬁning the scalar ﬁeld such that φ = N , the scalar
α = ξ ≡ − 1
ﬁeld sector for this type of actions can be completely reconstructed,

(4.5)

Note that, here, H = H(φ) is expressed in terms of the scalar ﬁeld φ, so that by assuming a
Hubble parameter evolution, the full action is reconstructed following the above steps. Let
us then consider some inﬂationary models and reconstruct the corresponding α(ξ). Firstly,
we consider the Hubble expansion [45]:

H(N ) =pc0N + c1 ,

(4.6)

where {c0, c1} are constants. Note that slow-roll inﬂation occurs provided the Hubble pa-
rameter Hinf during inﬂation can be approximated by a constant as long as both c1/c0 ≫ N
and c1 > 0 hold, and eventually decays when c0 < 0 (c.f. [45] for further details). Then, the
equation (4.3) turns into

2(c1 + c0N )α′′(N ) + (c0 + 4c1 + 4c0N )α′(N ) + 2(c0 + 3c1 + 3c0N )α(N ) = 0 .

(4.7)

This equation can be easily solved, leading to the following general solution:

α(N ) = e−x/c0x1/4(cid:20)A1J 1/4(cid:18) x

c0√2(cid:19) + A2Y 1/4(cid:18) x

c0√2(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

(4.8)

where x = c1 + c0N , {A1, A2} are integration constants and {J n,Y n} hold for the Bessel
functions of the ﬁrst and second kind, respectively. Then, the corresponding scalar ﬁeld
sector α(ξ) is obtained following (4.4). In the event of a linear dependence α ∝ ξ, the kinetic
term and scalar potential are given by (4.5).

Let us now consider another type of inﬂationary model, described in this case by an

exponential expansion:

H(N ) =pc2eβN + c3 ,

(4.9)

where c2, c3, and β(> 0) are constants. Note that this type of model mimics a power-law
inﬂation, where the scale factor is given by a = ¯atˆn. It is straightforward to show that during
inﬂation the Hubble parameter (4.9) turns out to be H 2 = (ˆn/t)2 = ˆn2 exp (−2N/ˆn), where
c2 ∼ ˆn2, β = −2/ˆn, and c3 ∼ 0. Then, as in the previous example, we can reconstruct the
gravitational Lagrangian by use of Eq. (4.3), which in this case becomes

2xα′′(x) + [x(4 + β) − c3β] α′(x) + [x(3 + β) − c3β] α(x) = 0 ,

(4.10)

– 9 –

where x = c3 + c2eβN . Thus, this ﬁeld equation can be solved, leading to:

α(x) = (cid:20)A3 U(cid:18)a, b + 1,

a =

4p−32 − 8β + β2

Here U is the conﬂuent hypergeometric function and L is the Laguerre polynomial, whereas
{A3, A4} are integration constants. As in the previous case, the full scalar ﬁeld sector α(ξ)
is obtained once the dependence of α = α(ξ) is found by integrating Eq. (4.4). Hence, the
above inﬂationary models can be reproduced within this kind of scalar-tensor theories with
non-minimal couplings. In the following section, both models (4.6) and (4.9) are constrained
below by using the Planck/Bicep2 data.

4.2

f (R, ξ) = α(ξ) + γ(R) Model

Let us now consider a similar K-essence model, whose gravitational Lagrangian is given by,

f (R, ξ) = α(ξ) + γ(R) ,

(4.13)

i.e., the gravitational Lagrangian is split in two diﬀerent contributions: the ﬁrst γ(R) made
of powers of the Ricci curvature as fourth-order theories and a second α(ξ) where powers of
the ξ quantity may be encapsulated. In this case, the FLRW equations (2.14) yield

3H 2γR =

(4.14)

Here the second equation above provides an algebraic expression for α(ξ):

α = −γ − (6H 2 + 4HH′ − R)γR − 2(cid:2)(2H 2 + HH′)R′ + H 2R′′(cid:3) γ2R − 2H 2R′2γ3R .

Then, by the ﬁrst FLRW equation in (4.14) and redeﬁning again the scalar ﬁeld as φ = N ,
the corresponding kinetic term is obtained:

αξω(φ) = 3γR −

(4.16)

Thus, for inﬂationary models of the form (4.6) and (4.9), the equations (4.15) and (4.16)
can be solved and the functions γ(R) and α = α(ξ) determined, at least numerically, so that
the corresponding action (4.13) can be reconstructed. In fact, for the paradigmatic inﬂation-
ary Hubble parameter parameterisations above, analytical expressions are neither obtained
for γ(R) nor for α = α(ξ) so we decided not to illustrate the whole results, although numer-
ical γ(R) and α = α(ξ) could be easily depicted.

the exponential model (4.9). As shown, the model (4.9) ﬁts better the observational constraints as
provided by Bicep2/Kerr array and Planck.

Let us now constrain in Fig. 1 the classes of models given by Eqs. (4.6) and (4.9) by
using the data released from a joint analysis of the Bicep2/Kerr array and Planck missions
[42]. Here we have used the values provided by such analysis, namely ns = 0.968 ± 0.006,
and an upper bound for the scalar-to-tensor ratio r < 0.07

5 Deviations from Starobinsky inﬂation

Let us now study some deviations from the so-called Starobisnky inﬂation [41], where an
action of the kind (2.1) is considered. Starobinsky inﬂation has been a remarkably successful
inﬂationary model, capable of satisfying with great accuracy the observational constraints.
The model is given by a particular case of f (R) theories, where a quadratic scalar curvature
correction is added to the standard Einstein-Hilbert term, namely

f (R) = R +

R2
6 m2 ,

(5.1)

the parameter m2 being a free constant to be constrained by the observations, providing the
mass of the dynamical scalar degree of freedom present in the model, inherent to every f (R)
model and dubbed scalaron. In this Section we will analyze models that can be thought of
as slight departures from this paradigmatic case. For the sake of simplicity, we perform our
calculations in the Einstein frame, where they turn out to be more straightforward. Hence,
the action (5.1) can be written in as a Brans-Dicke-like action which reads as follows

S =

1

2κ2 Z d4x√−g [ϕR − Q(ϕ)] .

(5.2)

After applying the conformal transformation (2.7), the action is shifted to the Einstein frame
and becomes

(5.3)

˜S =Z d4xp−˜g" ˜R

2κ2 −

2

∂µ ˜ϕ∂µ ˜ϕ − ˜Q( ˜ϕ)# ,

˜Q( ˜ϕ) =

3

4κ2 m2(cid:16)1 − e−√2/3κ ˜ϕ(cid:17)2

.

(5.4)

Hence, when considered in the Einstein frame, the Starobinsky model (5.1) is described
by (5.3).
If one now assumes a ﬂat Robertson-Walker geometry in the Einstein frame,
which remains a good approximation during inﬂation, both frames (Einstein vs. Jordan)
are connected as follows

ds2 = −d˜t2 + ˜a(˜t)2d~r 2 , Ω−1d˜t = dt , Ω−1˜a(˜t) = a(t) ,

(5.5)

where we recall that the conformal transformation connecting both frames is given by Ω2 =
ϕ = e√2/3κ ˜ϕ. Hence, the FLRW equations to be obtained from Eq. (5.3) correspond to

inﬂationary models with a single scalar ﬁeld minimally coupled, i.e., Eqs. (3.2), such that
slow–roll inﬂation occurs in the regime κφ ≫ 1, i.e., as long as the ﬁeld ˜φ rolls down the ﬂat
part of the potential (5.4) slowly enough, and the kinetic energy of the inﬂaton remains much
˙˜φ2 ≪ ˜Q( ˜φ). Then the Friedman equation (3.2) together

In the last step of the above relations we have assumed that κ ˜ϕ ≫ 1. Inﬂation ends provided
that ǫ ≃ 1, which corresponds to the inﬂaton kinetic energy becoming important. As usual,
the amount of inﬂation is measured by the number of e-foldings N , which is deﬁned as

N ≡Z tend

˜Hdt.

(5.8)

To reach agreement with observations, one usually requires that N ≃ 55 − 65. Now, under
the slow–roll approximation the above relation (5.8) takes the following approximate form

and the integration is performed with respect to ˜ϕ. Notice that the number of e-foldings is
related to the slow-roll parameters, as

The spectral indices corresponding to the scalar and tensor ﬂuctuations, under the slow-roll
regime are respectively given by the relations (3.7). Note that from Planck data one gets

– 12 –

a value for the spectral index of ns = 0.968 ± 0.006, and an upper bound for the scalar-to-
tensor ratio r < 0.07 comes from a joint analysis of the BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck data
[42]. In order to illustrate the power of Starobisnky inﬂation, the assumption of a number of
e-folds Ne = 65, leads to the following values of the inﬂationary observables:

ns = 0.968 ,

r = 0.00284 ,

in agreement with observations.
inﬂation, we ﬁrst consider an action of the type (4.13),

In order to analyze certain modiﬁcations of Starobinsky

S =

2κ2 Z dx4√−g(cid:20)R +

R2

6m2 + 2κ2α(ξ)(cid:21) .

(5.12)

This action, similarly to (2.3), can be rewritten in terms of only scalar ﬁelds. Nevertheless,
in the previous action the scalar ﬁeld sector and the curvature are not directly coupled, so
that only one auxiliary ﬁeld is required. The introduction of such an auxiliary ﬁeld leads
(5.12) to

S =

1

2κ2 Z d4x√−g(cid:2)ϕR − Q(ϕ) + 2κ2α(ξ)(cid:3) .

(5.13)

At this stage, the action is transformed to the Einstein frame by means of the conformal
transformation (2.7), what yields

analogously to Eqs. (3.2), are given by

Nevertheless, note that in general multiﬁeld inﬂationary models, perturbations not only in-

long-wavelenght limit k → 0, the r.h.s. of (5.19) does not vanish, in general, unless C, which
depends on the background evolution, does. The entropy ﬂuctuations are then given by

become negligible, such that the spectral index is given by [48]

that the expressions (5.22) reduces to the corresponding ones for a single scalar ﬁeld (3.6)

perturbations and compute just the spectral index (5.21) when the eﬀects of the extra scalar

As shown, in general it is very diﬃcult to obtain, analytically, information for the modiﬁed
Starobisnky inﬂation model (5.14), when one considers a generic scalar potential V (φ). Nev-
ertheless, since we are assuming the scalar ﬁeld φ to behave similarly to ˜ϕ, in order to avoid
isocurvature perturbations, we are here allowed to consider a potential V (φ) similar to ˜Q( ˜ϕ)
in (5.4), thus given by

where V0 and k are positive constants. Considering now that during inﬂation

V (φ) = V0(cid:16)1 − e−kφ(cid:17)2

In this way, the predictions from Starobinsky inﬂation (5.11) are fully recovered. As ex-
pected, the term in front of the scalar potential V (φ), in the equations above, screens this
potential, so that no deviation is induced, as long as one considers a potential of the form
(5.26). However, any other choice that may compensate the screening will lead to curves in
the scalar ﬁeld space, thereby inducing isocurvature modes and also providing deviations in
the adiabatic modes.

Another modiﬁcation of Starobinsby inﬂation can be described by the following action,

S =

1

2κ2 Z dx4√−g"(R + ξ) +

(R + ξ)2

6m2 # .

(5.31)

– 15 –

Then, following the procedure described in Sec. 2, the action above can be rewritten by using
an auxiliary ﬁeld ϕ as follows:

S =

1

2κ2 Z d4x√−g(cid:2)ϕ(R + ξ) − Q(ϕ) + 2κ2Lm(cid:3) ,

where the potential is given by,

Q(ϕ) =

3m2

(ϕ − 1)2 .

(5.32)

(5.33)

As above, we may consider the scalar potential ˜V ( ˜φ) = V0(cid:16)1 − e−k ˜φ(cid:17)2

, and assume that
both ﬁelds slow roll similarly in order to avoid isocurvature modes. By a ﬁrst look, such
assumptions, together with (5.27) would lead to similar results as above, i.e. to the Starobin-
sky predictions. However, since the kinetic term of ˜φ is not screened by the other scalar
˙˜φ2 ∼ 2 ˙˜ϕ2, and the slow-roll parameters can be
ﬁeld as in the case above, this leads to ˙˜ϕ2 +

(5.41)

Hence, the factor 1/2 does not aﬀect the scalar-to-tensor ratio r = 16ǫ but it does the spectral
index. Then, in order to satisfy the Planck constraints, inﬂation has to be shorter, i.e. the
number of e-foldings has to be smaller. Whether one assumes N ∼ 50, which is usually the
lower bound for inﬂation to address the initial conditions problems, the following spectral
index and scalar-to-tensor ratio are obtained:

ns = 0.978

r = 0.0048 .

(5.42)

Note that while the scalar-to-tensor ratio satisﬁes the Planck/Bicep2 constraint of r < 0.07,
this is not the case for the spectral index, whose value given by Planck is ns = 0.968± 0.006,
such that model (5.31) predicts a value lies out of the 1σ region as given by Planck, that
is closer to scale invariant perturbations. In addition, other choices of the scalar potential
˜V ( ˜φ) will likely lead to isocurvature perturbations, so that this model has an slightly diﬀerent
predictions than Starobinsky inﬂation, although the values (5.42) may be still considered as
viable.

6 Conclusions

In this paper we have explored the inﬂationary paradigm in the framework of theories beyond
General Relativity where non-minimal couplings of the scalar curvature with a scalar ﬁeld are
considered. As we have proved in Sec. 4, inﬂation can certainly be achieved in these classes
of action, which extend both the usual K-essence theories and the standard scalaron ﬁeld.
Thus we have also shown in the same Section that all the observational constraints provided
by the Planck survey latest data [42] are smoothly satisﬁed. In this sense, we have devel-
oped a reconstructing method for the gravitational action capable of reproducing convenient
slow-roll inﬂationary models. Then, once the expressions for the slow-roll parameters for a

– 17 –

general evolution are set, the corresponding constraints for every model are obtained. As
one of the main results herein, a wide range of inﬂationary models were proved to fulﬁll such
constraints and, consequently, the class of theories analysed giving rise to such inﬂationary
models can be reconstructed.

Moreover, we have then considered in Sec. 5 the so-called Starobinsky inﬂation to which
an additional scalar ﬁeld is added. There we have analysed two diﬀerent ways of modifying
Starobinsky inﬂation. In both of them, we have shown that similar results as in ordinary
Starobinsky inﬂation can be achieved as well as provided the conditions on the extra scalar
ﬁeld potential to be satisﬁed.
In this sense, when one assumes that both ﬁelds slow roll
similarly, the isocurvature perturbations become negligible, whereas the adiabatic ones lead
approximately to the same result as in standard Starobinsky inﬂation. Nevertheless, we have
seen that any other choice for the potential will lead to corrections that may, in principle,
be kept under control by the appropriate parameters, but which will inevitably give rise to
a non-negligible isocurvature mode, which may rule out the model. In addition, whilst the
ﬁrst modiﬁcation Starobinsky inﬂation as given in (5.12) leads to the same predictions as
the original Starobinsky model, provided the above assumptions are considered, the second
model (5.31) analysed here yields a slightly diﬀerent value of the spectral index, which do not
lie within the error bars provided by Planck [42]. Generally, we can say that, as in previously
considered multiﬁeld inﬂationary models, one needs to impose strong conditions on the extra
ﬁelds in order to guarantee its range of validity. Thus, deviations as the ones considered here
turn out to be severely constrained.

In conclusion, we have carefully analysed f (R, ξ) theories and their viability in order
to provide realistic inﬂationary scenarios, which is clearly achieved in some speciﬁc cases.
In addition, we have shown that modiﬁcations of Starobinsky inﬂation are allowed, as far
as the extra ﬁelds slow roll in a similar fashion as the standard inﬂaton does and we have
shown that those models where the extra scalar ﬁeld is minimally coupled to the Starobinsky
gravitational action are favoured.
