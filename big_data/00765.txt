Abstract

Results are reported from a search for the pair production of top squarks, the super-
symmetric partners of top quarks, in ﬁnal states with jets and missing transverse mo-
mentum. The data sample used in this search was collected by the CMS detector and
corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 18.9 fb−1 of proton-proton collisions at a
centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV produced by the LHC. The search features novel back-
ground suppression and prediction methods, including a dedicated top quark pair
reconstruction algorithm. The data are found to be in agreement with the predicted
backgrounds. Exclusion limits are set in simpliﬁed supersymmetry models with the
top squark decaying to jets and an undetected neutralino, either through an on-shell
top quark or through a bottom quark and chargino. Models with the top squark de-
caying via an on-shell top quark are excluded for top squark masses up to 755 GeV in
the case of neutralino masses below 200 GeV. For decays via a chargino, top squark
masses up to 620 GeV are excluded, depending on the masses of the chargino and
neutralino.

1 Introduction
The standard model (SM) of particle physics is an extremely powerful framework for the de-
scription of the known elementary particles and their interactions. Nevertheless, the existence
of dark matter [1–3] inferred from astrophysical observations, together with a wide array of
theoretical considerations, all point to the likelihood of physics beyond the SM. New physics
could be in the vicinity of the electroweak (EW) scale and accessible to experiments at the
CERN LHC [4]. In addition, the recent discovery of a Higgs boson [5–7] at a mass of 125 GeV
[8–10] has meant that the hierarchy problem, also known as the ‘ﬁne-tuning’ or ‘naturalness’
problem [11–16], is no longer hypothetical.

A broader theory that can address many of the problems associated with the SM is supersym-
metry (SUSY) [17–21], which postulates a symmetry between fermions and bosons. In partic-
ular, a SUSY particle (generically referred to as a ‘sparticle’ or ‘superpartner’) is proposed for
each SM particle. A sparticle is expected to have the same couplings and quantum numbers
as its SM counterpart with the exception of spin, which differs by a half-integer. Spin-1/2 SM
fermions (quarks and leptons) are thus paired with spin-0 sfermions (the squarks and slep-
tons). There is a similar, but slightly more complicated pairing for bosons; SUSY models have
extended Higgs sectors that contain neutral and charged higgsinos that mix with the SUSY
partners of the neutral and charged EW gauge bosons, respectively. The resulting mixed states

are referred to as neutralinos(cid:101)χ0 and charginos(cid:101)χ±.

Supersymmetry protects the mass of the Higgs boson against divergent quantum corrections
associated with virtual SM particles by providing cancellations via the corresponding correc-
tions for virtual superpartners [22–25]. Since no sparticles have been observed to date, they are
generally expected to be more massive than their SM counterparts. On the other hand, sparti-
cle masses cannot be arbitrarily large if they are to stabilise the Higgs boson mass without an
unnatural level of ﬁne-tuning. This is particularly important for the partners of the third gen-
eration SM particles that have large Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson [26–29]. The top and

bottom squarks ((cid:101)t and(cid:101)b), are expected to be among the lightest sparticles and potentially the
lightest SUSY particle (LSP) is stable. If the lightest weakly interacting neutralino ((cid:101)χ0

of the(cid:101)t and(cid:101)t ending in SM particles and LSPs. The latter do not interact with material in the

most accessible at the LHC, especially when all other constraints are taken into consideration
[27, 30]. With conservation of R-parity [31, 32], SUSY particles are produced in pairs and the

detector and so must have their presence inferred from missing transverse momentum (cid:126)p miss
,
which in each event is deﬁned as the projection of the negative vector sum of the momenta
of all reconstructed particles onto the plane perpendicular to the beam line. Its magnitude is
referred to as Emiss
Within the Simpliﬁed Model Spectra framework [34–36] the study presented here considers
two broad classes of signals that lead to a bbqqqq + Emiss
ﬁnal state via decay modes denoted

T2tt and T2bW. These are deﬁned, respectively, as (i)(cid:101)t decay to an on-shell top quark: (cid:101)t →
1 → bW+(cid:101)χ0
t(cid:101)χ0

1, and (ii)(cid:101)t decay via a chargino: (cid:101)t → b(cid:101)χ+ → bW+(cid:101)χ0

diagrams representing these two simpliﬁed models. The two decay modes are not mutually
exclusive, and it is possible for one of the top squarks to decay as in T2tt and the other as in
T2bW. However, such a scenario is not considered in the analysis presented here.

With event characteristics of these signals in mind, we have developed a search for pair pro-
duction of top squarks with decays that result in a pair of LSPs in the ﬁnal state in addition to

SM particles. Two selection criteria address the desire to extract a potentially very small signal
from a sample dominated by top quark pair events. The ﬁrst criterion comes from the Emiss
signature associated with the LSPs, which motivates the focus on all-hadronic ﬁnal states, as
this eliminates large sources of SM background events with genuine Emiss
from neutrinos in
leptonic W decays. The all-hadronic ﬁnal state with Emiss
comprises the largest portion of the
signal because W bosons decay predominantly to quarks. For the same reason this ﬁnal state
makes up an even higher proportion of the subset of events with high jet multiplicity includ-
ing many jets with high transverse momentum, pT, that is often required in SUSY searches to
eliminate SM backgrounds. The second criterion relies upon the identiﬁcation of top quark de-
cay products to eliminate such backgrounds as SM production of W bosons in association with
jets. Together, these criteria deﬁne a preselection region consisting of events that pass stringent
vetoes on the presence of charged leptons, and are required to have large Emiss
, two tagged b
quark jets, and four additional jets from the hadronisation and decay of light quarks.

In spite of these stringent requirements, the low production cross sections of new physics sig-
nals mean that they are easily overwhelmed by SM backgrounds. In the case of SUSY, for ex-

ample, the cross section for the production of top squark pairs with m(cid:101)t = 800 GeV is predicted

to be nearly ﬁve orders of magnitude smaller than that of top quark pairs [37]. For this rea-
son, this analysis focuses heavily on the development of innovative approaches to background
suppression. The relevant SM processes contributing to this analysis fall into four main cate-
gories: (i) top quark and W boson events where the W decays leptonically, thereby contributing
genuine Emiss
, but the lepton is not successfully reconstructed or identiﬁed, or it is outside the
acceptance of the detector; (ii) invisible decays of the Z boson when produced in association
with jets, Z+jets with Z → νν; (iii) QCD multijet production, which, due to its very large rate,
can produce events with substantial Emiss
in the very rare cases of extreme mismeasurements
of jet momenta in events with true or mistagged b jets; and (iv) ttZ production (with Z → νν),
which is an irreducible background to signals with top squark decays via on-shell top quarks.
The ttZ process has a small cross section that has been measured by ATLAS and CMS to be
176+58−52 fb−1 [38] and 242+65−55 fb−1 [39], respectively.
The ﬁrst step in developing the search is the construction of a set of optimised vetoes for all
three lepton ﬂavours that reduce SM backgrounds for both signal types. Next, speciﬁc fea-
tures of each signal type are exploited by combining several variables in a multivariate anal-
ysis (MVA) based upon Boosted Decision Trees (BDT). For T2tt, a high performance hadronic
top quark decay reconstruction algorithm is developed and used to facilitate discrimination of
signal from background by using details of top quark kinematics.

This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the CMS detector, while Section 3 dis-
cusses event reconstruction, event selection, and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of signal and
background. The top quark pair reconstruction algorithm and lepton vetoes are described in
Sections 4 and 5, respectively. The search regions are discussed in Section 6, and the evalu-
ation of backgrounds is presented in Section 7 along with a discussion of the method of MC
reweighting. Final results and their interpretations are presented in Section 8, followed by a
summary in Section 9.

2 CMS detector
The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diame-
ter, providing a magnetic ﬁeld of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip
tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintilla-
tor hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Extensive
forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors.
The silicon tracker measures charged particles within the range |η| < 2.5. Isolated particles
of pT = 100 GeV emitted with |η| < 1.4 have track resolutions of 2.8% in pT and 10 (30) µm
in the transverse (longitudinal) impact parameter [63]. The ECAL and HCAL measure en-
ergy deposits in the range |η| < 3. Quartz-steel forward calorimeters extend the coverage
to |η| = 5. The HCAL, when combined with the ECAL, measures jets with a resolution
∆E/E ≈ 100%/
E[GeV] ⊕ 10% [64]. Muons are measured in the range |η| < 2.4. Match-
ing muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative pT resolution for muons
with 20 < pT < 100 GeV of 1.3–2.0% in the barrel and better than 6% in the endcaps. The pT
resolution in the barrel is better than 10% for muons with pT up to 1 TeV [65].
The events used in the searches presented here were collected using a two-tiered trigger system:
a hardware-based level-1 trigger and a software-based high-level trigger. A more complete
description of the CMS detector, together with a deﬁnition of the coordinate system used and
the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in [66].

√

3 Data sample and event selection
This search uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.9 fb−1 collected at a
centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV [67]. Events are reconstructed with the CMS particle-ﬂow (PF)
algorithm [68, 69]. Each particle is identiﬁed as a charged hadron, neutral hadron, photon,
muon, or electron by means of an optimised combination of information from the tracker, the
calorimeters, and the muon systems. The energy of a photon is obtained from the ECAL mea-
surement, corrected for zero suppression effects. For an electron the energy is determined
from a combination of its estimated momentum at the primary interaction vertex as deter-
mined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of
all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track [70].
Muon momentum is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The energy of
charged hadrons is determined from a combination of the momentum measured in the tracker
and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and

4

for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Charged hadrons associated
with vertices other than the primary vertex, deﬁned as the pp interaction vertex with the largest
sum of charged-track p2
T values, are not considered. Finally, the energies of neutral hadrons are
obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energies.
Particles reconstructed with the CMS PF algorithm are clustered into jets by the anti-kT algo-
rithm [71, 72] with a distance parameter of 0.5 in the η-φ plane. For a jet, the momentum is
determined as the vectorial sum of all associated particle momenta and is found from MC sim-
ulated data to be within 5–10% of the true momentum of the generated particle from which
the jet originates over the whole pT spectrum and detector acceptance. An offset correction
determined for each jet via the average pT density per unit area and the jet area is applied to
jet energies to take into account the contribution from pileup, deﬁned as the additional proton-
proton interactions within the same or adjacent bunch crossings [64]. Jet energy corrections
are derived from simulated events and are conﬁrmed with in situ measurements of the energy
balance in dijet and photon+jet events. Additional selection criteria are applied to each event
to remove spurious jet-like features originating from isolated noise patterns in certain HCAL
regions [73].

Jets referred to as ‘picky jets’, are the input to the Comprehensively Optimised Resonance Re-
construction ALgorithm (CORRAL) for top quark reconstruction. The picky jet collection is not
constrained to any ﬁxed characteristic width or cutoff in reconstruction and is therefore more
effective in isolating the clusters of particles associated with the main top decay products, such
as the b quark jet and the two jets associated with the W boson decay. This leads to an im-
provement in the reconstruction of top quark decays with a wide range of Lorentz boosts, as
expected in signal events. The CORRAL and picky jet algorithms are described in Section 4.

Jets are identiﬁed as originating from the hadronisation of a bottom quark (b-tagged) by means
of the CMS combined secondary vertex (CSV) tagger [74, 75]. The standard CMS “tight” oper-
ating point for the CSV tagger is used [74], which has approximately 0% b tagging efﬁciency,
0.1% light ﬂavour jet misidentiﬁcation rate, and an efﬁciency of 5% for c quark jets.

Several simulated data samples based on MC event generators are used throughout this analy-
sis. Signal samples are produced using the MADGRAPH (version 5.1.3.30) [76] event generator
with CTEQ6L [77] parton distribution functions (PDFs). For both the T2tt and T2bW signals,
) is varied
from 0 to 700 GeV for T2tt and 0 to 550 GeV for T2bW. The masses are varied in steps of 25 GeV
in all cases. For the T2bW sample the chargino mass is deﬁned via the fraction x applied to

fractions for x : 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75.
Standard model backgrounds are generated with MADGRAPH, POWHEG (version 1.0 r1380) [78–
82], PYTHIA (version 6.4.26) [83], or MC@NLO (version 3.41) [84, 85]. The MADGRAPH generator
is used for the generation of Z and W bosons accompanied by up to three additional partons as
well as for diboson and ttW processes, while the single top quark and tt processes are generated
with POWHEG. Multijet QCD events are produced in two samples, one generated with PYTHIA
and the other with MADGRAPH. The ttZ background has ﬁnal states that are extremely similar
to those of the signal, making it impossible to deﬁne useful data control samples. For this rea-
son, the MC@NLO generator is used, while an additional sample generated with MADGRAPH
is employed to calculate a systematic uncertainty in the ttZ yield. The decays of τ leptons are
simulated with TAUOLA (version 27.121.5) [86].

The PYTHIA generator is subsequently used to perform parton showering for all signal and

5

background samples, except for the MC@NLO ttZ sample, which uses HERWIG (version 6.520) [87].
The detector response for all background samples is simulated with GEANT4 [88], while the
CMS fast simulation package [89] is used for producing signal samples in the grid of mass
points described earlier. Detailed cross checks are performed to ensure that the results ob-
tained with the fast simulation are in agreement with those obtained with the GEANT-based,
full simulation.
Events are selected online by a trigger that requires Emiss
T > 80 GeV and the presence of two
central (|η| < 2.4) jets with pT > 50 GeV. Ofﬂine, a preselection of events common to all search
samples used in the analyses has the following requirements:

• There must not be any isolated electrons, muons, or tau leptons in the event. This
that

requirement is intended mainly to suppress backgrounds with genuine Emiss
arise from W boson decays.
• There must be Emiss
T > 175 GeV and at least two jets with pT > 70 GeV in the region
|η| < 2.4, where the online selection is fully efﬁcient.
• The azimuthal angular separation between each of the two highest pT jets and (cid:126)p miss
must satisfy |∆φ| > 0.5, while for the third leading jet, the requirement is |∆φ| > 0.3.
These criteria suppress rare QCD multijet events with severely mismeasured high-
pT jets.

Baseline selections for the two targeted signal types are then deﬁned by the following addi-
tional requirements. The T2tt baseline selection requires one or more b-tagged picky jets with
pT > 30 GeV and |η| < 2.4, and at least one pair of top quarks reconstructed by the CORRAL
algorithm. The T2bW baseline selection requires at least ﬁve jets (pT > 30 GeV and |η| < 2.4)
of which at least one must be b-tagged. SM background yields, estimated as described in Sec-
tion 7, and signal yields after the baseline selections are shown in Table 1. The trigger efﬁciency
is measured to be greater than 95% for events passing these baseline selections.

4 Top quark pair reconstruction for the T2tt simpliﬁed model
The T2tt and T2bW signal modes involve the same ﬁnal-state particles but differ in that only
T2tt involves the decays of on-shell top quarks. The only SM background with potentially large
Emiss
and a visible component that is identical to that of T2tt is ttZ, with the tt pair decaying

hadronically and the Z boson decaying invisibly to neutrinos. Efﬁcient identiﬁcation of a pair
of hadronically decaying top quarks in events with large Emiss
provides an important means of
suppressing most other backgrounds. As mentioned in the previous section, we developed the
CORRAL dedicated top quark reconstruction algorithm for this purpose. Kinematic properties
of the top quark candidates reconstructed with CORRAL are exploited to further improve the
discrimination of signal from background.

T

Top quark taggers are typically characterized by high efﬁciencies for the reconstruction of all-
hadronic decays of top quarks that have been Lorentz boosted to sufﬁciently high momentum
for their ﬁnal state partons and associated showers to form a single collimated jet. Such taggers
are not ideal for this analysis because the top quarks from top squark decays can experience
a wide range of boosts, and it is not uncommon for one of the top quarks to have a boost
that is too low to produce such a coalescence of ﬁnal-state objects. An additional problem
arises with traditional jet algorithms that do not always distinguish two separate clusters of
particles whose separation is smaller than their ﬁxed distance parameter or cone radius. In
addition, for low-pT jets and those originating from hadronisation of b quarks, it is not unusual
for algorithms with ﬁxed distance metrics to miss some of the particles that should be included
in the jet. These issues are addressed by making use of a variable jet-size clustering algorithm
that is capable of successfully resolving six jets in the decays of top quark pairs with 30-40%
efﬁciency in moderately boosted events.

The algorithm starts by clustering jets with the Cambridge–Aachen algorithm [90, 91] with a
distance parameter of 1.0 in the η-φ plane to produce what will be referred to as proto-jets.
Studies based on MC simulation show that this parameter value is large enough to capture
partons down to pT = 20 GeV originating from top quark decays in most cases of interest. Each
proto-jet is then considered for division into a pair of subjets. The N-subjettiness metric [92],
τN, is used to determine the relative compatibility of particles in a proto-jet with a set of “N”
jet axes. It is deﬁned as the pT-weighted sum of the distances of proto-jet constituents to the
nearest jet axis, resulting in lower values when the particles are clustered near jet axes and
higher values when they are more widely dispersed. As discussed in Ref. [92], the exclusive
two-jet kT algorithm [93, 94] can be used to ﬁnd an initial pair of subjet axes in the proto-
jet that approximately minimize the τ2 metric. The exclusive two-jet algorithm differs from
the inclusive kT algorithm in that it does not have a distance parameter. It simply clusters a
speciﬁed set of particles into exactly two jets. In our case, the axes are varied in the vicinity of
the local set until a local minimum in the value of τ2 is found. This deﬁnes the ﬁnal set of axes
and each particle in the proto-jet is then associated with the closest of the two axes, resulting in
two candidate subjets.

An MVA ‘picky’ metric is then used to determine if it is more appropriate to associate the
particles with two subjets than with the original proto-jet. The input variables include the τ1
and τ2 subjettiness metrics, the mass of the proto-jet, the (η,φ) separation of the two subjets,
and a proﬁle of the proto-jet’s energy deposition. An MVA discriminator working point is
deﬁned as the threshold value at which the efﬁciency to correctly split proto-jets into distinct
constituent subjets of top quark decays is 95%, while incorrectly splitting fewer than 10% of
jets that are already distinct constituents. If the discriminator value doesn’t meet or exceed the
threshold, the proto-jet is treated as a single jet and added to the ﬁnal jet list, otherwise the
two subjets enter the proto-jet list to be considered for possible further division. The algorithm
runs recursively until there are no remaining proto-jets, yielding a collection of variable-size jet
clusters known as ‘picky’ jets.

The efﬁciency to correctly cluster W bosons (top quarks) into two (three) picky jets satisfying

7

the basic acceptance requirements of pT > 20 GeV and |η| < 2.4 is shown in Fig. 2 as a function
of generated particle pT in all-hadronic T2tt events with m(cid:101)t = 650 GeV and m(cid:101)χ0
= 25 GeV.
In each event the six quarks that originate from all-hadronic decays of the two top quarks
are matched to reconstructed picky jets. The matching process uses the decay products of
the quarks after hadronization and fragmentation but prior to detector response simulation.
The ‘generator-level’ particles are clustered together with the full reconstructed particles used
to form the picky jets as described above, but the momentum of each of the generator-level
particles is scaled by a very small number so that the picky jet collection is not altered by their
inclusion. A quark is then determined to be matched to the picky jet that contains the largest
fraction of the quark’s energy if it is greater than 15% of the quark’s total energy. In the case
that two or more quarks are associated with the same picky jet, the picky jet is matched to the
quark with the largest clustered energy in that jet.

The energy of each resulting picky jet is corrected for pileup by subtracting the measured en-
ergy associated with pileup on a jet-by-jet basis by means of a trimming procedure similar to the
one discussed in Ref. [95]. The procedure involves reclustering of the particles associated with
the jet into subjets of radius 0.1 in η-φ and then ordering them by decreasing pT. The lowest
pT subjets are removed one-by-one until the summed momentum and mass of the remaining
subjets have minimal differences with the same quantities after subtracting an estimate of the
pileup contribution [96]. The reconstructed W boson and top quark masses as a function of the
number of reconstructed primary vertices are shown in Fig. 3 in all-hadronic T2tt events with
= 25 GeV. The reconstructed mass values are seen to have no pileup de-
pendence after the trimming procedure is applied. No additional jet energy scale corrections,

The pT spectra of picky jets in MC data are corrected to match those observed in data in tt and
Z+jets control samples by rescaling of individual picky jet pT values. The rescaling factors are
derived separately for each of the two processes and for the ﬂavour of parton that initiated the
jet. They are found to be within 2–3% of unity. Picky jets can also be b-tagged with the CSV
algorithm by considering the tracks that have been used in their formation.

A candidate for a hadronically decaying top quark pair is a composite object constructed from
six picky jets that passes every step of the CORRAL algorithm, which will now be described.
To reduce the number of jet combinations that must be considered, the algorithm involves sev-
eral stages, with progressively tighter selection criteria at each stage. First, BDTs are trained to
discriminate the highest pT jet coming from a top quark decay and jets are labeled seed jets if
they have an associated discriminator value that exceeds a high efﬁciency cutoff value. Three-
jet top quark candidates are then constructed from all combinations of three jets in the event
that include at least one seed jet. High quality top quark candidates are those that pass one of
two MVA working points chosen to identify 97–99% of those cases in which the jets are cor-
rectly matched to top quark decays and to reject 60–80% of the candidates that are not correctly
matched. The most important input variables are the W boson and top quark invariant masses
and the picky jet b tagging discriminator value. Other variables such as the angular separations
of the jets are included for additional discrimination. A ﬁnal list of top quark pairs contains
all combinations of two high quality top quark candidates with distinct sets of three jets. The
ﬁnal reconstructed top quark pair used in the analysis is the one with the highest discriminator
value from a BDT that is trained with variables similar to those used in the candidate selection
but also including information on the correlations between the top quark candidates.

The CORRAL algorithm reconstructs at least one top quark pair in every event that has six or

more picky jets. However, CORRAL is not strictly a top quark tagger that must distinguish
events with top quarks from events without top quarks. It is designed to reconstruct top quark
pairs in data samples that are predominantly made up of top quark events, as is the case for the
T2tt part of this analysis. In Fig. 2, the efﬁciency for correctly resolving the top quark quark pair
= 25 GeV is shown at each stage of the algorithm.
The two hadronic top quark decays are each resolved into three distinct picky jets in 15–70% of
events, depending on the boost of the quarks. In nearly all of these events the correct six jets
pass the CORRAL jet seeding and top quark candidate selection requirements and are used to
form the correct top quark pair among a number of top quark pairs found in the event. The
correct reconstructed pair is chosen to be used in the analysis in 30-80% of events, depending
on top quark pT.
Properties of the reconstructed top quark pairs used in the analysis are compared to true top
quark pair quantities in Fig. 4 for events in which the top quark pair is correctly resolved and
selected to be used in the analysis and for the events in which the top quark pair is not fully
resolved or selected. In the fully resolved and selected case the reconstructed separation in φ
between the two top quarks agrees with the true separation within 0.1 in over 80% of events.
Even in the case of the reconstructed top quark pair not fully resolved or selected, there is
reasonable agreement because the top quark pair is constructed with ﬁve of the six correct jets
in the majority of these events.

The signal discrimination that is achieved by exploiting differences in the kinematics of the
reconstructed top quark pairs in simulated signal samples and those in simulated SM back-
ground samples is illustrated in both simulation and data in Fig. 5. The left plot shows the
minimum separation in the η-φ plane between any two jets in the reconstructed top quark can-
didate with the highest discriminator value, labelled t1. The separation tends to be smaller in
T2tt signal events because the top quarks with the highest discriminator value are more likely
to be boosted. Similarly, the right plot shows the distribution for the separation in φ between
the jet direction and (cid:126)p miss
for the jet with the smallest such separation from the sub-leading
reconstructed top quark, labelled t2. The distribution for the semileptonic tt background, in-
volving tt events in which one W boson decays leptonically, is shifted to low values of ∆φ
because the t2 top quark candidates in tt events typically use the b jet from the leptonically
decaying top quark, which is correlated in angle with the (cid:126)p miss
from the leptonically decaying
W boson.

5 Rejection of isolated leptons
Searches for top and bottom squarks in data samples containing leptons have been the sub-
ject of previous searches that are among those referenced in the introduction. This analysis
uses independent data samples with no identiﬁed leptons for the ﬁnal signal searches. The
main backgrounds for this analysis nevertheless arise from semileptonic tt events with lost or
misidentiﬁed leptons. Sensitivity to signal is therefore improved by identifying and rejecting
events with charged leptons originating from prompt W boson decays as efﬁciently as possible.
On the other hand, signal events often contain identiﬁed charged leptons that do not arise from
W boson decays. These include leptons from decays of hadrons, or charged hadrons that have
been misidentiﬁed as charged leptons. It is advantageous to not reject these events in order
to achieve high signal efﬁciency. In events with Emiss
T > 175 GeV and ﬁve or more jets, the
standard CMS lepton identiﬁcation algorithms operating at their tightest working points can
identify semileptonic tt events with efﬁciencies of 54% and 60% for ﬁnal states involving elec-
trons and muons, respectively. This analysis makes use of MVA techniques to achieve higher

The MVAs used here combine a number of moderately discriminating quantities into a single
metric that can be used for electron and muon identiﬁcation. Electrons and muons must have
pT > 5 GeV, |η| < 2.4, and are required to satisfy the conditions for the loose working point
of the standard CMS identiﬁcation algorithms [65, 70], for which the efﬁciencies for electrons
and muons in the tracker acceptance are above 90%. The discriminating variables used in the
training of the muon identiﬁcation BDT are the pT of the muon, its track impact parameter

information, relative isolation in terms of charged and neutral particles, and the properties of
the jet nearest to the muon. Isolation in terms of charged and neutral hadrons is deﬁned by
means of separate sums of the pT of charged and neutral PF particles, respectively, in a region
near to the lepton, divided by the lepton pT. The properties of the nearest jet that are used
include the separation from the lepton in the η-φ plane, the momentum of the lepton relative
to the jet axis, and the CSV b tagging discriminator value for the jet. For electron identiﬁcation,
the variables include all of those used for the muon, plus several electron-speciﬁc variables that
are used in the standard CMS electron identiﬁcation MVA [70].

The BDTs are trained using simulated event samples with electrons or muons.
In particu-
lar, single-lepton tt events are the source of prompt leptons, while electrons or muons in all-
hadronic tt events are used for non-prompt leptons. The leftplot in Fig. 6 shows the selection
efﬁciency, by lepton type, for non-prompt leptons as a function of that for prompt leptons in
the BDT training samples. The curves are obtained by varying the cutoff on the corresponding
BDT discriminator value above which events are accepted. In this analysis, the discriminator
values that are chosen have efﬁciencies of 98% for events with electrons and muons from W bo-
son decays that pass the preselection requirements, while incorrectly selecting no more than 5%
of all-hadronic tt events. The latter gives some indication of the expected loss of all-hadronic
top squark signal events. Upon including reconstruction and acceptance inefﬁciencies, these
requirements eliminate 80% of single-electron and single-muon tt events with Emiss
T > 175 GeV
and ﬁve or more jets.

A similar approach is used to identify hadronically decaying tau leptons originating from
semileptonic tt decays. The τ identiﬁcation algorithm focuses on decays involving a single
charged hadron in conjunction with neutral hadrons because the majority of hadronic τ decays
are to ﬁnal states of this type, which are often referred to as ‘one-prong’ decays. No attempt

is made to speciﬁcally reconstruct the sub-dominant ‘three-prong’ decays. A τ candidate is
thus deﬁned by a track and a nearby electromagnetic cluster produced by the photons from
π0 → γγ decay, if present, in order to include more of the visible energy from the τ lepton
decay. Since every charged particle with pT > 5 GeV and |η| < 2.4 could be considered to be
a τ candidate, we reduce the pool of candidates by using the transverse mass, mT, calculated
from (cid:126)p miss
and the momentum of each candidate. As seen in the rightplot in Fig. 6, the mT
distribution for genuine τ candidates has an endpoint at the mass of the W boson, reﬂecting
the fact that the neutrinos associated with W boson and τ lepton decays are the largest source
of Emiss
in these events. The background candidates do not have this constraint, and so each τ
candidate is required to have mT < 68 GeV.
The variables used in a BDT discriminator for the identiﬁcation of the τ candidate are the track
pT, |η|, and distance of closest approach to the primary vertex, as well as the isolation quantities
and general properties of the jet in which the τ candidate is contained. The isolation variables
include the separate sums of the transverse momenta of charged and neutral PF particles, in
cones of radii 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 centered on the candidate, and the distance between the
candidate and the nearest track. The jet variables used are the separation in the η-φ plane
between the track and the jet axis, and the b tagging discriminator value for the jet. This BDT is
trained with hadronically decaying τ candidates originating from semileptonic tt decays in MC

simulation for prompt candidates, while all τ candidates in all-hadronic T2tt events with m(cid:101)t =
620 GeV and m(cid:101)χ0

= 40 GeV are used for the non-prompt candidates. The samples produced
with these T2tt mass parameters are not included in the ﬁnal array of T2tt samples used in the
later stages of this analysis. The T2bW baseline selection is applied to all events in order to have
training samples whose kinematic selection criteria are consistent with those used to select the
data samples used for the searches. The mT cutoff value and the BDT discriminator value are

chosen to keep losses below 10% in the all-hadronic signal samples targeted by this analysis.
The efﬁciency for correctly selecting the background of semileptonic tt events with hadronically
decaying tau leptons is 65%. This efﬁciency is deﬁned relative to events for which the τ lepton
decay products include at least one reconstructed charged particle with pT > 5 GeV.
The efﬁciencies for selecting leptons in simulation are corrected to match those measured in
data after applying the T2bW baseline selection criteria. The multiplicative correction factors
applied to the simulated electron and muon selection efﬁciencies for this purpose are 0.95 ±
0.03 and 1.01 ± 0.03, respectively. The corrections to the simulated τ selection efﬁciency are
1.30 ± 0.10 for τ candidates with pT < 10 GeV and 0.98 ± 0.04 for all other candidates.

6 Search regions
As discussed above, this analysis makes use of MVA techniques based on BDTs to achieve
sensitivity to direct production of top squark pairs in the all-hadronic ﬁnal states of the T2tt
and T2bW simpliﬁed models in the presence of three main classes of much more copiously
produced SM backgrounds. The signal space of the T2tt simpliﬁed model is parameterised by
the masses of the top squark and the neutralino. The T2bW simpliﬁed model also includes
an intermediate chargino, and is therefore parameterised by three masses. For each model, a
large set of simulated event samples is prepared, corresponding to a grid of mass points in two
dimensions for T2tt, and in three dimensions for T2bW. A large set of moderately to strongly
discriminating variables, discussed in more detail below, is input to each BDT to yield a single
discriminator value ranging between −1.0 and +1.0 for each event considered. Events with
values closer to 1 (−1) are more like signal (background).
Since there are potentially signiﬁcant differences in the kinematic characteristics of signal sam-
ples at different points in the mass grids described above, it is not known a priori what is the
minimum number of distinct BDTs that are needed to achieve the near optimal coverage of the
signal spaces. To this end, a minimum number of BDTs that provides sufﬁcient coverage of
each signal space is selected from a larger superset that includes BDTs that are each uniquely
trained on grid points separated by ≈100 GeV in top squark mass and ≈50 GeV in neutralino
mass for both signal types. For T2bW, there are also 3 different values of chargino mass that are
considered, corresponding to x = 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75. Sensitivity to signal is probed by varying
discriminator thresholds from 0.5 to 1.0 in steps of 0.01. Ultimately it is determined that four
BDTs for T2tt and ﬁve for T2bW are adequate to cover the largest possible parameter space
with near optimal signal sensitivity. Each BDT tends to cover a speciﬁc portion of signal space,
referred to as a search region. The optimisation of the overall search does not depend strongly
on the speciﬁc signal points that are used to train individual BDTs. Moreover, adding more
regions is found to not increase the sensitivity of the analysis. Table 2 lists the search regions
for both signal types, the mass parameter points used to train each BDT, and the optimal BDT
discriminator cutoffs that are used to deﬁne the ﬁnal samples. Figure 7 displays the most sen-
sitive search regions in T2tt and selected T2bW mass planes. The colour plotted in any given
partition of the plane corresponds to the search region BDT with the strongest expected limit
on the signal production cross section.

For the T2tt search a total of 24 variables are used. They can be divided into variables that
do or do not rely upon top quark pair reconstruction by the CORRAL algorithm. The latter in-
clude mT calculated with (cid:126)p miss
in φ,
a quark-gluon jet discrimination variable, Emiss
, and jet multiplicity. Two additional variables
provide a measure of the centrality of the event activity. They are the η of the peak in jet ac-
tivity, as obtained by a kernel density estimate [97, 98], and the ∆η between two peaks in jet

and the (cid:126)pT of the b-tagged picky jet that’s closest to (cid:126)p miss

activity. Another variable counts the number of unique combinations of jets that can form re-
constructed top quark pairs. The remaining seventeen variables are all built with information
pertaining to the candidate top quark pair obtained from CORRAL. The invariant mass of the
top quark pair and the relative pT of the two reconstructed top quarks are used to take into
account correlations between the two top quark candidates that generally differ for signal and
background. The degree of boost or collimation of each top quark candidate is measured with
three variables, including the minimum cone size in the η-φ plane that contains all of the recon-
structed particles from the top quark decay. Two variables use the CORRAL discriminator value
for each of the two top quarks as a measure of the quality of the reconstruction. Two other
variables measure the angular correlation with (cid:126)p miss
for the lower-quality member of the top
quark pair. The last eight variables are the pT values for the six jets in the top quark pair and
two CSV b jet discriminator values that each correspond to the highest b tagging discriminator
value obtained for the three jets that make up each of the two top quark candidates.

There are 14 variables used to train the BDTs that target the T2bW ﬁnal state, half of which are
the same or very similar to those used for the T2tt ﬁnal state. Four of these are commonly used
to distinguish SM background from SUSY signals. They are Emiss
, jet multiplicity, multiplicity
of jets passing the CSV b tagger medium working point, and the azimuthal separation of the
third-leading jet from (cid:126)p miss
. Variables that are sensitive to correlations between b jets and the
rest of the event are the invariant mass formed with the two highest pT b-tagged jets; mT formed
with (cid:126)p miss
and the nearest b-tagged jet; and the standard deviation of the separation in pseu-
dorapidity between the b-tagged jet with the highest pT and all other jets in the event. Three
additional variables are used to suppress SM background by exploiting the higher probability
for jets in SM events to originate from gluons. Three other variables make use of jet kinematics,
the most important of which is the scalar sum over pT of jets whose transverse momenta are
within π/2 of the direction of (cid:126)p miss
) < π/2) divided by the corresponding
sum for all jets that do not meet this criterion. The ﬁnal variable is the invariant mass for a pair
of nearby jets that have the highest vector sum pT among all jet-pair combinations. This choice
is found in simulation to have a high probability to correspond to the decay of a W boson. This
variable is useful in the suppression of Z+jets.

7 Estimation of SM backgrounds
We divide the important SM backgrounds into three classes. The ﬁrst class, referred to as EW
backgrounds, includes semileptonic and dileptonic decays of tt, W+jets, and Z+jets with Z →
νν. The second class of backgrounds originates from high-Emiss
T QCD multijet processes, and
the third arises from associated production of ttZ with Z → νν and both top quarks decaying
to hadrons. The latter produces a ﬁnal state that is extremely similar to that of the signal but is
fortunately very rare.

The estimation of the EW and QCD multijet backgrounds is based on MC samples in which

parisons in control regions. The reweighting of the events assures that the simulation samples
match data samples with regard to distributions of quantities that are relevant to the selec-
tion of events in the signal regions. However, it is important to note that the reweighted MC
samples are not used directly to estimate backgrounds in the signal region. Rather, the search
region yields and uncertainties are estimated by comparing the reweighted MC samples to data
in background-speciﬁc control regions that differ from the search regions only in that they are
obtained with selection criteria that simultaneously increase the purity of a single background
and reduce any potential signal contamination. In the case of the EW backgrounds the con-
trol regions are selected by requiring one or more isolated leptons, while for the QCD multijet
background it is selected by requiring (cid:126)p miss
The ttZ background is estimated directly from a sample of next-to-leading-order (NLO) MC
simulation events generated with MC@NLO. This procedure is motivated by the fact that ttZ
has a much lower cross section than other SM processes, making it impossible to deﬁne control
regions that are sufﬁciently well-populated to enable the extraction of scale factors. The single
top quark process is also estimated directly from simulated events, in this case generated with
POWHEG, and found to make negligible contribution to the signal regions.

7.1 EW and QCD background estimates with MC reweighting

This analysis uses MC samples as the basis for the estimation of SM backgrounds in signal
regions. These simulations have been extensively tested and tuned in CMS since the start of
LHC data taking in 2009. As a result, they accurately reproduce effects related to the detailed
geometry and material content of the apparatus, as well as those related to physics processes
such as initial-state and ﬁnal-state radiation. Nevertheless, the MC samples are not assumed
to be perfect and display discrepancies with data in some kinematic regions. The comparisons
between data and MC simulation in this analysis are performed in control regions that satisfy
many, but not all, of the selection criteria used to deﬁne the signal regions. These comparisons
result in the scale factors that are applied to the MC simulation, as described below, to reduce
the observed discrepancies. The corrected simulation samples are then used together with data
in relevant control regions to obtain the ﬁnal estimates of the SM backgrounds.

T

The scale factors fall into two conceptually different categories. The ﬁrst category involves
effects associated with detector modelling and object reconstruction that are manifested as dis-
crepancies in jet and Emiss
energy scales and resolutions, lepton and b jet reconstruction efﬁ-
ciencies, and trigger efﬁciencies. The second category corresponds to discrepancies associated
with theoretical modelling of the physics processes as represented by differential cross sec-
tions in collision events. The scale factors in this category are estimated separately for each SM
background process. The main sources of discrepancy here are ﬁnite order approximations in
matrix element calculations and phenomenological models for parton showering and hadro-
nisation. Scale factors are parameterised as a function of generator-level quantities controlling
post-simulation event characteristics relevant to the ﬁnal selection criteria used in the analysis.
The scale factors are derived by comparing distributions of variables after full reconstruction
that are particularly sensitive to these generator-level quantities, as seen in comparisons of MC
with data. D’Agostini unfolding with up to four iterations [99], implemented with RooUn-
fold [100], is used to determine the correct normalization of the generator-level quantities such
that the distributions agree after full reconstruction. The scale factors are deﬁned as the ratio
of the corrected values of generator-level quantities to their original values. The MC events are
reweighted by these scale factors, thereby eliminating any observed discrepancies with data.
The scale factors are generally found to be close to unity as a result of the high quality of the
MC simulation. The inclusive kinematic scale factors lead to no more than 10% shifts in any

regions of the distributions of HT and number of jets that are relevant to this analysis.

7.1.1 Detector modelling and object reconstruction effects

The detector modelling and object reconstruction scale factors are grouped into the following
categories: lepton identiﬁcation efﬁciency, jet ﬂavour, jet pT, and (cid:126)p miss
For the lepton identiﬁcation efﬁciency, the event yields of simulated data passing the lepton
vetoes in the search regions are corrected by scale factors as described in Section 5. Similarly,
in the control regions deﬁned by the presence of a single lepton as described in Section 7.1.2,
scale factors are applied to the simulated electron and muon reconstruction, identiﬁcation, and
trigger efﬁciencies. These scale factors are measured by applying a “tag-and-probe” technique
to the pairs of leptons coming from Z boson decays [65, 70, 101].

T

.

Identiﬁcation of jet types, via b tagging and gluon-jet discrimination, is important for the COR-
RAL top reconstruction algorithm and the signal discriminator used in the T2tt search. Both
use the CSV b tagging algorithm output values directly rather than setting a particular cutoff
value as is done for standard CMS loose, medium, and tight working points [74]. It is therefore
important that the CSV discriminator output distributions in simulated event samples match
those seen in corresponding data samples. To this end, the CSV discriminator output of each
picky jet is corrected so that the CSV output distributions for simulated tt and Z+jets event
samples match those observed in semileptonic tt and Z → (cid:96)+(cid:96)− control samples, respectively.
Similarly, the quark-gluon likelihood discriminator distribution is corrected to match data. The
jet energy scale is corrected as described in Section 3, and the simulated picky jet pT spectrum
is corrected as described in Section 4.

T

The rejection of SM backgrounds in this analysis is very much dependent on the measurement
of Emiss
and its resolution, which is not modelled perfectly in simulation. Corrections are there-
fore applied to MC simulated samples of EW and QCD multijet processes in order to obtain
good agreement with data in search region variables that depend on the correlation of event
activity with Emiss
. There are three separate corrections [102] applied for EW processes that
are derived from a control sample of Z+jets events with Z → (cid:96)+(cid:96)− where, by conservation of
energy and momentum, the reconstructed Z boson provides an accurate measure of the energy
associated with all other activity in the event as measured in the transverse plane. Sources
of genuine Emiss
such as neutrinos in these events, are rare and have a negligible effect on
the derived corrections. The corrections are based upon comparisons of data to simulation in
Z → (cid:96)+(cid:96)− control samples in which (cid:126)p miss
is decomposed into components parallel and per-
pendicular to the direction of the Z boson pT. The components and their resolutions are then
investigated as a function of a variety of quantities to look for systematic trends and biases that
can then be corrected. In this way, an Emiss
scale correction of order 1% is obtained as a func-
tion of both the boson pT and the distribution of hadronic energy in the event relative to the
energy of the boson. The second and third corrections involve an increase in the jet resolution
by 9% and smearing of the reconstructed Emiss
by approximately 4.5 GeV. The measured Emiss
resolution in simulation matches that found in the data control regions after these corrections
are applied.
For the EW backgrounds the Emiss
corrections are parameterised in such a way that the cor-
rected MC samples are consistent with data in Emiss
-related quantities, such as the recon-
structed W boson mT. In contrast, for the discrimination between QCD multijet events and
SUSY signal events, the angular correlations between (cid:126)p miss
and the pT of leading jets in the
event are the most important variables. Corrections are therefore obtained expressly for this
background process with the QCD multijet data control sample described in Section 7.1.4. The

corrected simulation samples result in a good match to the angular correlations between (cid:126)p miss
and the leading jets in data.

T

7.1.2 Corrections to the theoretical modelling of EW background processes

The kinematic distributions of simulated EW processes are validated and corrected with data
control samples with charged leptons in the ﬁnal state. Depending on the process under study,
these samples are dominated by tt, W+jets, or Z+jets events. Based on the physically reason-
able assumption that the kinematics of the rest of the event should be largely independent of
the boson decay(s) in these processes, the control samples are used in conjunction with corre-
sponding MC samples to extract scale factors that are then applied to MC samples in the search
regions to estimate background contributions.

T

The simulated event kinematics of tt, Z+jets, and W+jets processes are corrected by a series of
scale factors that are parameterised by generator-level quantities. Three different control sam-
ples, each speciﬁc to a given process as noted above, and each with one or two well identiﬁed
isolated leptons, are used to derive these scale factors. The tt control sample is selected by
requiring exactly one muon and at least three jets, one or two of which are b-tagged. These cri-
teria are very effective in eliminating other types of backgrounds. The selection of the W+jets
control sample includes exactly one muon, no b-tagged jets in order to reduce tt contamina-
tion, and mT > 40 GeV, formed with the muon (cid:126)pT and (cid:126)p miss
, in order to reduce QCD multijet
contamination. The Z+jets control region is deﬁned by the requirement of exactly two muons
or electrons with an invariant mass in the range 80 < m(cid:96)(cid:96) < 100 GeV, to be consistent with the
mass of the Z boson, and no b-tagged jets. Finally, two additional Z+jets and W+jets control
samples, used to correct the production of radiated b jets, are formed by removing the b jet veto
in the deﬁnitions of the standard control regions.
The scale factors are extracted as functions of the pT of the boson in the case of W+jets and
Z+jets or of the momenta of the top quarks in the case of tt. They also depend on the multi-
plicity and ﬂavour of radiated jets as well as HT, the scalar sum of jet pT. Because the control
samples have ﬁnite sizes, the scale factors are organised into subsets that are derived and used
sequentially. That is, prior to each derivation step, the scale factors extracted in the previous
derivation steps are applied. For example, scale factors for correcting the tt jet multiplicity and
HT spectra are obtained and applied prior to calculating those used to correct the production
of Z bosons in conjunction with heavy-ﬂavour jets, since as much as 60% of the events in the Z
control sample are tt events.

7.1.3 Estimation of EW background

The corrections to the MC event samples based on scale factors, as discussed above, results in
an agreement of MC and data distributions that is typically within 10% for all control samples,
including samples that were not used to extract the scale factors. This level of agreement is also
found for distributions of many kinematic variables for which no corrections were explicitly
applied. There are a few regions in which kinematic distributions disagree at the level of 20%,
but these disagreements have been found to have a negligible impact on the search region pre-
dictions. A bootstrapping procedure is used [103] to take into account statistical uncertainties
in the derived scale factors for distributions of kinematic quantities and their correlations.

After correcting MC simulation samples for detector, reconstruction, and kinematic discrep-
ancies, a closure correction and its uncertainty are measured, where closure is deﬁned as the
largest residual data-MC difference seen in a number of kinematic distributions. To this end,
data-MC comparisons are performed in a variety of leptonic control regions for which the kine-

matic distributions under study are as similar as possible to those in the search regions as seen
for MC samples that pass the signal selection criteria. The leptonic control samples used for the
closure tests are obtained by applying the full set of baseline requirements, with the exception
of the lepton vetoes. The tt and W+jets control samples consist of events in which exactly one
charged lepton has been identiﬁed. The charged lepton is removed from the list of physics ob-
jects in the event, leading to an additional component of (cid:126)p miss
that simulates the case in which
the charged lepton has not been correctly reconstructed as would happen should it fall into
an un-instrumented region of the apparatus. The Z+jets control sample is deﬁned by the re-
quirement that there be exactly two oppositely charged leptons of the same ﬂavour, having an
invariant mass consistent with that of the Z boson. The charged leptons are then removed from
the event, altering the (cid:126)p miss
Comparisons of the BDT discriminator outputs for data and corrected MC simulation for tt and
W+jets control samples, after removal of the single identiﬁed charged lepton in each event, are
shown in Figs. 8 and 9, with the ﬁrst ten bins in each plot covering the full BDT discriminator
range. The closure is quantiﬁed by comparing the predicted event counts in MC simulation to
those found in data in a ‘validation region’, deﬁned as the region containing the events with a
single lepton that pass all of the ﬁnal signal selection criteria after the lepton is removed, and in
two control regions that extend the ﬁnal search region to lower BDT discriminator values. The
latter are deﬁned by doubling and tripling the difference between unity and the discriminator
cutoff value used for the ﬁnal search region. These two additional regions are needed because
the search region is statistically limited in some cases. The results for the signal region and the
two extended regions are shown in the last three bins in Figs. 8 and 9, for the four T2tt and ﬁve
T2bW BDT discriminators, respectively. In every case the differences seen in the event counts
for data and MC simulation in the extended regions are statistically compatible with the differ-
ence seen in the search region. Therefore, the data over simulation ratio in the ﬁrst extended
region is used as a correction for any potential residual bias in the event counts obtained with
MC samples in which the events pass all of the signal region selection criteria, now including
the lepton veto requirements. The uncertainty in the correction is taken to be the statistical
uncertainty in the data over simulation ratio in the last bin, which we have referred to as the
validation region. This choice assures that the uncertainty covers any potential unknown dif-
ferences between the search region and the ﬁrst extended search region. For the four separate
T2tt search regions, the largest correction is 35% in the very-high-mass region, with the closure
uncertainties ranging from 8% in the low-mass region to 31% in the very-high-mass region. For
the ﬁve separate T2bW search regions, the largest correction is 21%, and the uncertainties in the
corrections range from 10% to 33%.

The simulated data are similarly compared to data in the Z+jets control sample in Figs. 10
and 11. No statistically signiﬁcant lack of closure is observed for any of the T2tt and T2bW
search regions. However, the small sample size makes it impossible to probe comparisons near
to the search regions. An uncertainty is therefore obtained by measuring the largest data-MC
discrepancy for each individual MVA input variable in the kinematic phase space of the search
regions. This is deﬁned for each input variable and search region as the ratio of event yields in
data relative to MC simulation after reweighting both distributions. The weights that are used
come from MC simulated distributions of the input variables after applying the MVA discrimi-
nator cutoff that is used for the search region. The distributions are normalised to unit area and
the normalised bin contents are the ﬁnal weights. The weights are applied to binned events
in both samples before taking the data/MC ratio in the control region where we measure the
uncertainty. The uncertainty in the Z+jets background prediction is then taken to be the differ-
ence with respect to unity of this ratio for the variable with the largest degree of nonclosure,

test is repeated with successively tighter MVA discriminator cutoffs to check if the extracted
closure uncertainty has any potential systematic trend related to discriminator cutoff. No sig-
niﬁcant trend is observed. The nonclosure is therefore measured for an MVA discriminator
value greater than or equal to 0.0 (−0.5) for T2tt (T2bW) search regions. These cutoff values
are the highest ones for which the magnitude of the statistical uncertainty is smaller than the
measured level of nonclosure. The uncertainties are found to range between 16% and 39%.

As an independent check of the Z+jets and W+jets processes, a second control sample is stud-
ied. This sample is collected with an Emiss
trigger and all lepton vetoes are applied. Discrep-
ancies of roughly 5% in the event counts relative to those predicted are observed for both the
Z+jets and W+jets processes. The full magnitude of this discrepancy is taken as an additional
uncertainty in the event counts for these background processes. After applying the closure cor-
rections to the MC simulated data in samples selected with the full set of preselection criteria,
no statistically signiﬁcant discrepancies are observed in any bins of discriminator value for any

While the simulated efﬁciencies for selecting electrons and muons are relatively well-matched
to what is seen in data, the efﬁciency for selecting τ leptons is observed to be signiﬁcantly
higher in simulation than in data for high values of some of the T2bW search region discrimi-
nators. To address this, a correction and associated uncertainty are determined by means of a
control region that is safe from signal contamination. The discrepancy is traced to a mismod-
elling of mT, which, as discussed in Section 5, is used for a preselection requirement of the tau
veto. The mismodelling of mT is due to the angular component of (cid:126)p miss
and is uncorrelated
with its magnitude. A control sample is deﬁned by applying the search region discriminator
selection to the full preselection sample after having replaced the magnitude of (cid:126)p miss
for each
event with a value that is randomly selected from the distribution of Emiss
values obtained for
the search region in MC simulation. A τ lepton veto efﬁciency is then obtained separately in
data and simulation by taking the ratio of the number of events that pass the full set of signal
region selection criteria but fail the τ lepton veto to the total number of events that pass the se-
lection criteria prior to applying the τ lepton veto. The ratio of the τ lepton efﬁciency in data to

7 Estimation of SM backgrounds

the efﬁciency in simulation is then used to correct the efﬁciency for the simulated background
samples with τ leptons from W boson decays in the signal region. This correction reduces the
data-MC discrepancy to a level that is not statistically signiﬁcant and decreases the simulated
τ lepton efﬁciency by a maximum of 29% in all cases considered, with an uncertainty of 13%.

The predictions in all search regions together with a breakdown of the various contributions
to their uncertainties are provided in Tables 3 and 4. In addition to the previously deﬁned
uncertainties and the lepton veto uncertainties (Section 5), a 50% systematic uncertainty for
MC modelling is assigned to the single top quark process due to the absence of closure control
regions that would enable kinematic scale factors to be determined for this background. Addi-
tionally, for the cases in which there are no simulated single top quark events entering a search
region, an upper bound on the single top quark contribution is established by multiplying the
ratio of the single top quark to tt event yields in the preselection region by the tt yield in the
search region.

7.1.4 Estimation of the QCD multijet background

T

T

Kinematic distributions in MC samples of QCD multijet processes are compared to those in
data control samples collected with an HT trigger. The same method of deriving a series of scale
factors parameterised by generator-level quantities that was used in the estimation of the EW
processes is applied here, but distributions of different quantities are used. In particular, the
jet pT spectrum and angular correlations among jets in the event are the quantities that provide
the most power in the identiﬁcation of QCD background. We also consider the distributions
of quantities related to heavy-ﬂavour production and the relative momenta of jets in the event.
After all corrections are applied, good closure is obtained: discrepancies between data and
simulation are less than 10% in distributions used to determine reweighting scale factors.
The one quantity that does, however, require special consideration is Emiss
. Most of the QCD
multijet background is eliminated by high-Emiss
requirements. The events that are not elim-
inated are mainly coming from the extreme tails of very broad distributions associated with
two mechanisms. Namely, in order to produce large Emiss
, a QCD multijet event must either
involve production of a heavy-ﬂavour hadron that decays leptonically, or it must be subject to
severe mismeasurement of jet momenta.
The simulation of these sources of Emiss
, particularly for the rare cases in which the events sur-
vive all selection requirements for the search regions, is not well understood, and it is difﬁcult
to study these mechanisms directly in data. This means that the QCD multijet background
cannot be estimated precisely and so a reliable upper bound is found instead. This is sufﬁ-
cient because the QCD multijet contribution is small compared to other backgrounds. To this
end, simulation samples having sources of large Emiss
-triggered data
in control regions to obtain scale factors and associated uncertainties that are used to reweight
simulated events. The resulting weights are then applied to simulation samples in the signal
region. Additional systematic uncertainties are applied to cover the uncertainties in the extrap-
olations of these corrections into the search regions.
The control regions used to derive scale factors are selected to have high Emiss
and low jet
multiplicity. Additionally, (cid:126)p miss
is required to be aligned with one of the jets to a degree that
is consistent with expectations for either of the two sources of Emiss
discussed above. The
jet with which (cid:126)p miss
is aligned is referred to as the probe jet in such events. The negative
vector sum of momenta of all jets in the event, other than the probe jet, provides an alternative
estimate of the probe jet momentum, since pT is conserved, within uncertainties, in the absence
of other severe mismeasurements. The recoil response, deﬁned as the ratio of the momenta of

are compared with Emiss

the probe jet to that for the rest of the activity in the event, (pT,probe/pT,recoil), is a very good
estimator for the true response of the probe jet, (pT,probe/pT,true), in the tails of the distribution,
where mismeasurement of the probe jet momentum dominates over the mismeasurement of
the recoil momentum. It is therefore used to derive separate scale factors for the jet resolution,
parameterised by jet pT, for each of the two sources of Emiss
The central values of the QCD background predictions are taken to be the MC simulation yields
in the signal regions after applying all of the corrections deﬁned above. The various statistical
and systematic uncertainties are highly asymmetric and in many cases non-Gaussian. There-
fore, in each search region an MC integration procedure is used to properly combine the un-
certainties. As expected from the central limit theorem, the combination of uncertainties can
be approximated by a Gaussian distribution, the parameters of which, in addition to the break-
down of their uncertainties, are listed in Tables 3 and 4.

.

Two shape uncertainties are assigned to the QCD multijet estimation in each search region. The

ﬁrst is a systematic uncertainty associated with the search region MVA discriminator distribu-
tion. It is obtained from a comparison of the distribution in MC simulation to that in data for
a sample of events passing baseline selection criteria, with the exception of the requirements
on the angular separation between the leading jets and (cid:126)p miss
. Dropping these criteria leads to
a signiﬁcant increase in the contribution of QCD multijet events to the ﬁnal sample relative to
all other backgrounds or signal. A second systematic uncertainty is obtained from the same
samples by comparing the MC distribution of the angle between (cid:126)p miss
and the leading jets to
that for data for a variety of discriminator cutoffs. The distributions are found to differ increas-
ingly with rising b-tagged jet multiplicity. The bias is eliminated by smearing the φ values of
the (cid:126)pT of b jets with a Gaussian having a standard deviation of about 0.02. The upper bound
on the QCD background is then obtained by increasing the width of the Gaussian until there
is a larger number of MC events predicted to pass the selection criteria than is observed in
data. The upper bounds found in this way are different for different search regions as a result
of variations in statistics and contributions of other SM processes. The values of the Gaussian
width that are found to cover all cases are 0.07 in the case of T2tt and 0.05 in the case of T2bW.
Finally, the QCD multijet simulated data are generated in discrete bins of HT in the case of
MADGRAPH and in bins of quark and gluon pT in the case of PYTHIA. The effective integrated
luminosity for some of the samples in particular bins can be much smaller than the 18.9 fb−1
of integrated luminosity collected in proton-proton collision data. A systematic uncertainty is
therefore applied to each QCD background prediction to cover a possible underprediction that
could be the result of a lack of events in these highly weighted bins.

T

7.2 Estimation of the ttZ background
Standard model ttZ production is a rare process (σ ∼ 0.2 pb) that becomes an important back-
ground in CORRAL-based search regions for the T2tt signal model where general tt backgrounds
have been greatly suppressed. Its contribution to the ﬁnal signal sample is predicted with sim-
ulated ttZ events created by the MC@NLO event generator with parton showering by HERWIG.
There are no sufﬁciently populated and uncontaminated data control regions in which to per-
form careful studies of this rare SM process. The simulated data are studied instead, making
use of variations in the parameters that control the generation and parton showering to estab-
lish systematic uncertainties in the estimated event counts in the signal regions. In addition, the
relative difference in yields between the default MC@NLO sample and a separate MADGRAPH
sample, with parton showering by PYTHIA, is used to estimate a systematic uncertainty asso-
ciated with MC generators. This uncertainty ranges between 3% and 26% depending on the
search region.

The uncertainty in the ttZ production cross section is estimated from a data control sample with
three reconstructed charged leptons drawn from a larger event sample that has been collected
with a set of dilepton triggers used for multilepton SUSY searches [104]. The two charged
leptons picked up by these triggers most often originate from the decay of a Z boson and are
thus oppositely charged, same-ﬂavour leptons. The third lepton can arise via the semileptonic
decay of a W coming from the decay of a top quark in ttZ events. The selection of events for
this control sample thus includes the requirement that two of the reconstructed leptons must
be consistent with the expectations for leptons from Z boson decay in ﬂavour, charge, and the
invariant mass of the pair. In order to reduce the contamination from other SM backgrounds,
events are also required to have at least three or more jets, at least six picky jets, and one or
more b-jets tagged with the medium CSV working point [74] in order to increase the relative
contribution of the ttZ process.

28

8 Results and interpretation

With a contribution of approximately 10%, diboson production is a leading SM process in this
region after ttZ. Thus, a diboson-enriched control region is established that makes use of the
same selection criteria as that described above for the ttZ control region, except that the b
tagging requirement is inverted to form a corresponding b-tag veto. This sample is used to
normalise the overall diboson process in MC simulation to that observed in data in regions
where it dominates over the ttZ process.

The ttZ and the diboson processes in the enriched control regions described above have esti-
mated event yields that are statistically consistent with the event yields predicted by simulation
samples. In view of this, the data-MC scale factors are taken to have central value of unity, and
no correction is applied. The statistical uncertainty in the ttZ scale factor is 31%. This is adopted
as a systematic uncertainty in the estimated yield of this background source.

A ﬁnal systematic uncertainty takes into account differences observed between the kinematic
distributions in MC simulation and data. To this end, we make use of the closure uncertainties
in the W+jets (including tt) and Z+jets background predictions that have been derived in the
lepton control regions as necessitated by the lack of an appropriate ttZ data control sample. The
maximum estimated uncertainty found for either of the two processes is taken to be the uncer-
tainty in the modelling of the kinematics for the ttZ process. This uncertainty ranges between
16% and 39%, depending on the signal sample. The ttZ prediction and all of its associated
uncertainties are listed in Tables 3 and 4.

8 Results and interpretation
The predicted distributions for discriminator values for the various independent T2tt and T2bW
searches described earlier are shown in Figs. 12 and 13. Event yields in data are plotted with
their statistical uncertainties and compared to the SM background predictions. The latter are
represented by the coloured histograms in the upper pane. Error bars on the ratios of the ob-
served to predicted event yields in the bottom pane include only statistical uncertainties. The
ﬁlled band in the lower pane of each plot represents the relative systematic uncertainty in the
background predictions. A vertical dashed red line near the right edge in the lower pane of
each plot marks the MVA discriminator value that is used to deﬁne the lower boundary of the
search region. Note that these ﬁgures are for illustrative purposes only. The uncertainties in
the more inclusive regions shown in these ﬁgures do not receive the detailed treatment that
is given to the calculation of uncertainties in the ﬁnal search region yields. In particular, the
ﬁlled band uses the uncertainty in the Z+jets background as the closure uncertainty in the tt
plus W+jets background, scaled by the ratio of the Z+jets to tt plus W+jets uncertainties in the
search region where these uncertainties have been carefully determined. In addition, a ﬁxed
50% uncertainty is used for the QCD multijet yields, while the systematic uncertainty in the
single top quark process and statistical uncertainty in kinematic scale factors are not included.

The line in the lower pane of each plot in Figures 12 and 13 labeled “MC (without corr.)”
represents the sum of the MC contributions, relative to the prediction, prior to weighting by the
corrective scale factors discussed in the preceding sections. There are no statistically signiﬁcant
differences observed upon comparing the data with the uncorrected (or corrected) MC samples.
Figures 14 and 15 provide a completely equivalent set of plots to those just described, but in
this case, no lepton vetoes have been included in the selection of events. The event yields
therefore are much higher in these cases. These data are used to provide a useful cross-check of
the tt plus W+jets kinematic closure test. They also allow for a check of the agreement in event
kinematics between MC simulation and data, without any potential biases that might arise in
association with the application of the lepton vetoes to the MC data. Data and simulation agree

within ±20% for all search regions.

The bottom pane of each plot shows the ratio of observed to predicted yields where the error
bars on data points only include the statistical uncertainties in the data and MC event yields.
The ﬁlled bands represent the relative systematic uncertainties in the predictions.

The predicted and observed yields in the T2tt and T2bW search regions are summarized in
Tables 5 and 6. No statistically signiﬁcant excess in data is observed. We therefore use these
results to set upper bounds on the production cross sections for the T2tt and T2bW families of
signal models.

ciencies are assessed as a function of the(cid:101)t and (cid:101)χ0

The signal yields and their corresponding efﬁciencies are estimated by applying the event se-
lection criteria to simulated data samples. Systematic uncertainties in the signal selection efﬁ-
1 masses, and as a function of the mass split-
ting parameter x in the case of the T2bW signal. The uncertainty in the jet energy scale (JES)
has the largest impact on signal yield, followed by the b tagging efﬁciency uncertainty. The
uncertainty associated with the parton distribution functions is evaluated by following the rec-
ommendation of the PDF4LHC group [105–109]. Uncertainties in the jet energy resolution,
initial-state radiation, and integrated luminosity [67] are also included. For the T2tt chan-
nel, we assign three additional uncertainties. The ﬁrst accounts for the difference observed
in the performance of the CORRAL algorithm between the standard CMS full and fast detector
simulations. This difference decreases with increasing top quark pT and so depends on the

difference between m(cid:101)t and m(cid:101)χ0

1

, reaching 20% for cases where m(cid:101)χ0

1

is close to m(cid:101)t. The other

two uncertainties each have a magnitude of 5% and cover the differences observed in parton
shower (PS) algorithms (PYTHIA versus HERWIG) and top quark reconstruction efﬁciencies in
data vs. simulation. Table 7 lists the magnitude of each systematic uncertainty in signal points
for which this search has sensitivity. For T2tt, the total systematic uncertainty is less than 15%

certainties can depend on signal topology, mass values, and search region. The quoted value

In the absence of any observed signiﬁcant excesses of events over predicted backgrounds in
the various search regions, the modiﬁed frequentist CLS method [110–112] with a one-sided
proﬁle likelihood ratio test statistic is used to deﬁne 95% conﬁdence level (CL) upper limits on
the production cross section for both the T2tt and T2bW simpliﬁed models as a function of the
masses of the SUSY particles involved. Statistical uncertainties related to the observed numbers

of events are modelled as Poisson distributions. Systematic uncertainties in the background
predictions are assumed to be multiplicative and are modelled with log-normal distributions.

For each choice of SUSY particle masses, the search region with the highest expected sensitivity
(Fig. 7) is chosen to calculate an upper limit for the production cross section. The expected and
observed upper limits in the production cross section for both the T2tt and T2bW topologies in
plane are displayed in Fig.16. For the T2tt topology this search is sensitive to mod-

the m(cid:101)t − m(cid:101)χ0
els with m(cid:101)t < 775 GeV, or 755 GeV when conservatively subtracting one standard deviation of
model for m(cid:101)t > 600 GeV. Sensitivity extends to models with m(cid:101)χ0

This search is considerably less sensitive to the T2bW topology because that model does not

feature on-shell top quark decays. The sensitivity in this case extends to scenarios with m(cid:101)t <
650 GeV, with the strongest results for large x models for which m(cid:101)χ± is closer to m(cid:101)t than m(cid:101)χ0

9 Summary
We report a search for the direct pair production of top squarks in an all-hadronic ﬁnal state
containing jets and large missing transverse momentum. Two decay channels for the top
squarks are considered. In the ﬁrst channel, each top squark decays to a top quark and a neu-
tralino, whereas in the second channel they each decay to a bottom quark and a chargino, with
the chargino subsequently decaying to a W boson and a neutralino. A dedicated top quark pair
reconstruction algorithm provides efﬁcient identiﬁcation of hadronically decaying top quarks.
The search is carried out in several search regions based on the output of multivariate discrim-
inators, where the standard model background yield is estimated with corrected simulation
samples and validated in data control regions. The observed yields are statistically compati-
ble with the standard model estimates and are used to restrict the allowed parameter space for
these two signal topologies. The search is particularly sensitive to the production of top squarks
that decay via an on-shell top quark. For models predicting such decays, a 95% CL lower limit
of 755 GeV is found for the top squark mass when the neutralino is lighter than 200 GeV, ex-
tending the current limits on these models by 50–100 GeV. In models with top squarks that
decay via a chargino, scenarios with a top squark mass up to 620 GeV are excluded.
