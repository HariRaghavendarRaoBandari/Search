On Axisymmetric and Stationary Solutions of the

Self-Gravitating Vlasov System

Abstract

Axisymmetric and stationary solutions are constructed to the Einstein–Vlasov and Vlasov–
Poisson systems. These solutions are constructed numerically, using ﬁnite element methods
and a ﬁxed-point iteration in which the total mass is ﬁxed at each step. A variety of ax-
isymmetric stationary solutions are exhibited, including solutions with toroidal, disk-like,
spindle-like, and composite spatial density conﬁgurations, as are solutions with non-vanishing
net angular momentum. In the case of toroidal solutions, we show for the ﬁrst time, solutions
of the Einstein–Vlasov system which contain ergoregions.

1 Introduction

While the self-gravitating Vlasov system has proven to be a useful model in astrophysics, and
serves as a well-deﬁned matter model in general relativity, the space of axisymmetric solutions is
still poorly understood. These models are well-studied under the restriction to spherical symmetry;
see [1, 2] and references therein for the Vlasov–Poisson case, and [3] for a review in the Einstein–
Vlasov case. In going beyond spherically symmetry however, the equations become much more
complicated and few mathematical or numerical results have been established.

The purpose of this article is to construct solutions to the axisymmetric self-gravitating Vlasov
system via a numerical method. We start with an ansatz that the Vlasov distribution depends
on the phase space coordinates only through a function of the two classical integrals of motion,
and solve for the spatial density and gravitational potentials — the Newtonian potential, or in
the Einstein case, the metric ﬁelds. The solutions we obtain are thus guaranteed to be fully self-
consistent.
In this paper we investigate solutions which are obtained from ansatz functions of
simple form, as well as compositions thereof.

Shapiro and Teukolsky have also studied the self-gravitating Vlasov system, and numerically
construct axisymmetric solutions to the Vlasov–Poisson [4] and the Einstein–Vlasov [5, 6] systems.
Notably, they obtain solutions which are far from spherically symmetric in the relativistic case.
The existence of such solutions is only rigorously proved for solutions which are perturbed oﬀ
of spherically symmetric Newtonian solutions. These results are due to Andr´easson et al.
in [7]
for the static case, and in [8] for the stationary case. It remains an interesting open question to
prove the existence of solutions which are far from spherically symmetric, and it is hoped that the
numerics employed here will eventually help guide a suitable method of proof.

The present work validates, but also extends the above mentioned work of Shapiro and Teukol-
sky. In particular we are able to generate highly relativistic conﬁgurations which contain ergore-
gions. This is the ﬁrst instance, to the authors knowledge, of such results in the Einstein–Vlasov

literature. Ansatz functions can be easily and rapidly implemented in our code allowing for ex-
ploration of the vast solution space of the self-gravitating Vlasov system. In the present paper
we illustrate several diﬀerent choices of ansatz which generate toroidal, disk-like, and, spindle-like
solutions, as well as composite solutions formed from the sum of multiple ansatz functions.

Section 2 of the paper contains a presentation of the equations, including both the Vlasov–
Poisson and the Einstein–Vlasov systems, the boundary conditions, and the physical characteristics
of the solutions which are monitored in the numerical simulations. We present in Section 3 the nu-
merical method which is used in solving these equations. Section 4 is devoted to numerical results,
where we present generalized polytropic solutions (Section 4.1), relativistic toroidal solutions with
ergoregions (Section 4.2), disk-like solutions (Section 4.3), spindle-like solutions (Section 4.4), and
composite objects (Section 4.5).

2 The Axisymmetric Equations

2.1 Self-Gravitating Vlasov Matter

Self-gravitating Vlasov matter models a large collection of particles which do not interact pair-wise
via collisions, but only through the collective gravitational ﬁeld generated by the particles. For
this reason it is sometimes called collisionless matter. The model is statistical in that the matter is
described by a density function f : P Ñ r0,8r. In Newtonian theory and in three space dimensions
f “ fpt, x, pq (i.e. P “ R ˆ R6). In the framework of general relativity the density function is
deﬁned on a subset of the tangent bundle of a time-oriented Lorentzian manifold pM, gq, called
the mass-shell. For particles of mass m, the mass-shell P is deﬁned as the set of all future pointing
time-like vectors p of square length gpp, pq “ ´m2. The model is simpliﬁed by taking all particles
to have the same mass, which we set to one. Below we introduce the coupled self-gravitating
Vlasov matter systems when gravity is modeled using Newton’s equations, and with Einstein’s
equations. More thorough introductions to these systems can be found in [1, 2] (Vlasov–Poisson
case), and [3] (Einstein–Vlasov case).

2.2 The Axisymmetric Vlasov–Poisson System

It is conventional to denote the spatial density by the letter ρ. However, since we use ρ to denote
the cylindrical radial coordinate below, we instead choose w here and below. Our aim is to
numerically compute static solutions f0px, pq, U0pxq to Eqs. (2.1)–(2.2) under the assumption of
axisymmetry.
The above equations are reduced to a semilinear elliptic equation for the potential U0pxq by

which we take to be the px3 ” zq-axis. Since these quantities are conserved under the particle
motion, the Vlasov equation (2.1) is automatically satisﬁed. The density becomes a functional of
the potential w0pU0q :“ wf“f0 leading to the system

2.3 The Axisymmetric Einstein–Vlasov System

The Einstein–Vlasov system consists of the coupled equations for the metric tensor g and distri-
bution function f , which in arbitrary coordinates and geometric units (G “ c “ 1) reads

ijpgq are the Christoﬀel
symbols of the metric g, and Tijpg, fq is the energy momentum tensor associated with the Vlasov
matter.
in axial coordinates pt, ρ, z, ϕq (following [9]) as

For the stationary axisymmetric spacetimes considered in this paper the metric can be written

g “ ´e2νdt2 ` e2µdρ2 ` e2µdz2 ` ρ2B2e´2νpdϕ ´ ωdtq2,

(2.7)
where the metric ﬁelds ν, µ, B, ω depend only on the coordinates ρ, z. Note that ρ “ 0 is the
axis of symmetry, and that pρ, zq are cylindrical coordinates at inﬁnity in the sense that in the
appropriate limit ρ is the radius of the symmetry group orbits. The metric ﬁeld ω identically
vanishes for solutions with no net rotation.

It is useful, as in Andr´easson et al. [8], to introduce the following frame

v0 “ eνp0,

v2 “ eµp2,

v3 “ ρBe´νpp3 ´ ωp0q.

The time-independent energy momentum tensor can then be written as

In
particular, this choice allows one to consider solutions which contain ergoregions; for a more
detailed discussion of the issues see [8]. Moreover, f is taken to be a function on the forward
mass-shell, expressed in the v-basis as the positive root of pv0q2 “ 1 ` |v|2, which represents that
all particles move forward in time.

As in the Vlasov–Poisson case, we make an ansatz that the distribution function depends on
position and momentum through the particle energy E and angular momentum Lz about the axis,
f0 “ KΦpE, Lzq. These quantities, for which we have the expressions

E “ ´gpBt, piq “ e2νp0 ` ωpρBq2e´2νpp3 ´ ωp0q,

frame Eq. (2.8) we compute

With these deﬁnitions the energy momentum tensor components can be seen to become integral
expressions in the metric ﬁelds. It is convenient to introduce the following combinations of the
components of the energy momentum tensor, Φ00, Φ11, Φ33, Φ03, and perform the integration over
h and s. Let

These expressions can be seen to agree with those obtained by Andr´easson et al. in [8] if we note
that here we use the energy E rather than η :“ E ´ 1 used in that paper, and in addition we
set their parameter γ to one. The deﬁnition of Φ33 used here also contains an additional scaling
factor of pρBq´2 compared to that in [8].

As a result of the ansatz (2.4) and the above deﬁnitions, the Einstein–Vlasov system in this

case reduces to the following system of semi-linear elliptic equations for the metric ﬁelds

It is also sometimes convenient to use the ﬁeld ξ :“ ν ` µ. The Einstein equations imply two

One may replace Eq. (2.17) for µ in the Einstein system with the above equation for ξ. The
advantage in some cases comes from the fact that solving Eq. (2.19) requires only an integration
in the radial coordinate.

2.4 Boundary Conditions

In order to solve the equations (2.5) in the Vlasov–Poisson case, and Eqs. (2.15)–(2.18) in the
Einstein–Vlasov case we must impose boundary conditions. For the Vlasov–Poisson system we
prescribe

where r “ |pρ, zq| and M is the total mass of the particles given by

M “ 2π

R2

(2.20)

(2.21)

This boundary condition is exact in the spherically symmetric case, and serves as a leading order
approximation in axisymmetry. However, the error in the boundary condition can be reduced by
taking a computational domain which is large compared to the matter support.

For the Einstein–Vlasov system we seek solutions which are asymptotically ﬂat, from which it

follows [9, 10] that

(2.22)
where M is the total mass of the system, given by Eq. (2.24) below, and J is the total angular
momentum computed via Eq. (2.26). In addition we require that the metric be locally ﬂat at the
axis, which implies

νp0, zq ` µp0, zq “ ln Bp0, zq

(2.23)

for all z in the solution domain.

2.5 Solution Characteristics

Our numerical solutions may be characterized by several quantities. One of the most important
of such quantities is the total mass M. We compute M using the Komar expression [11], which
for the axisymmetric spacetimes considered here takes the form

We use the same letter w for the integrand here as for the density in the Vlasov–Poisson case

stationary asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes the Komar mass is equivalent to the ADM mass [12, 13].
The mass plays an essential role in our iteration scheme below. At each step of the iteration the
ansatz function is renormalized such that the total mass M is unity. The Komar expression for
the total mass of the system is derived from the time-symmetry of the spacetime. One also obtains
a Komar integral expression based on the axial symmetry, namely the total angular momentum

Under time evolution both the total mass M and the rest mass M0 are conserved.

One of the most important issues concerning the time evolution of stationary solutions is the
stability. In spherical symmetry there is numerical support [14] that the stability properties of
static solutions is related to the normalized binding energy Eb and the central redshift Zc. These
quantities are deﬁned by the following expressions

Below, we record these quantities for the solutions which we compute in anticipation of future
dynamical studies.
Another important measure of our solutions is the radius of support of the matter distribution.
In spherical symmetry the ratio 2M{R0, where R0 is the radius of support in areal coordinates,
is a measure of how relativistic a solution is. It has been proved that for spherically symmetric
regular bodies this quantity is bounded from above by 8{9 [15, 16], and it has also been proved
that for the spherically symmetric Einstein–Vlasov system this bound is sharp [17].

is the isotropic radius. In spherical symmetry this can be related to the areal radial coordinate R
through

(2.32)

In this paper we use the coordinate R deﬁned by the above expression even in absense of spherical
symmetry. We denote the support of the matter by R0, and in the isotropic radial coordinate by
r0. For a spherically symmetric solution, the radius of support can be determined from the cutoﬀ
energy E0 by matching the solution to a Schwarzschild exterior. The expression in terms of both
the areal and isotropic coordinates is

(2.33)

Shapiro and Teukolsky use the quantity R0 deﬁned by Eq. (2.33) as a measure of how relativistic
a solution is [6, 5].

3 Numerical Method

The numerical method used to solve the Vlasov–Poisson and Einstein–Vlasov systems is a direct
ﬁnite element discretization of Eqs. (2.5)–(2.6) and Eqs. (2.15)–(2.18), respectively, in combina-
tion with numerical integration of the matter terms. The resulting system of nonlinear discrete
equations is then solved using a particular ﬁxed-point iteration. We describe the ﬁnite element
discretization and ﬁxed-point iteration in some detail below.

3.1 Finite Element Method

Let us brieﬂy recall the ﬁnite element method (FEM) for solving a boundary-value PDE problem.
The idea is to formulate the boundary value problem as a variational problem in a Sobolev space
V where the solutions satisfy a corresponding weak-form of the equations. Once a variational form
has been obtained, one constructs a discrete approximating subspace Vh Ă V of the Sobolev space
V by discretizing the solution domain and constructing a discrete (ﬁnite-dimensional) function
space on the resulting ﬁnite element mesh, typically as a space of piecewise polynomial functions.
One then obtains a discrete system of equations by seeking the solution to the variational problem
on the discrete subspace Vh. If the original PDE is linear, one obtains a linear system that can be
solved using either an iterative or direct solver, while if the original PDE is nonlinear one obtains
a nonlinear system that can be solved using an iterative method such as ﬁxed-point iteration or a
Newton-type method.

Our solution domain is a half-disk of radius rb in the meridional half-plane deﬁned by

Hrb :“ tpρ, zq : 0 ď ρ ď rb,´rb ď z ď rbu.

We denote this by H below when the speciﬁc radius is not relevant for the discussion. Let
Irb :“ tpρ, zq P Hrb : |pρ, zq| “ rbu be the boundary of our solution domain at spatial inﬁnity, and
A “ tpρ, zq P Hrb : ρ “ 0u be the axis. Further, let (cid:104)u, v(cid:105) :“
H uv dρ dz denote the L2-product
on the solution domain H, where the factor of ρ usually present in the integration measure is
explicitly included in the product functions in the expressions below.

ş

The weak form of the equations is formally obtained by multiplying the equations by test
functions, integrating over the solution domain, and transferring derivatives onto the test functions
in the principle terms via integration by parts.
In the Vlasov–Poisson case, the weak form of
Eq. (2.5) reads

(3.1)

Remark 3.1. Due to the imposed axisymmetry of the problem, the integration over the two-
dimensional domain Hrb is carried out with respect to the measure 2πρ dρ dz. As a result, boundary
terms on the axis A are natural to the variational problem and vanish, whereas the boundary
conditions at inﬁnity Irb are imposed strongly on the ﬁnite element function space.

Following the FEM, these problems are solved by triangulating the solution domain (creating
a mesh), and solving the problems in a ﬁnite dimensional subspace Vh Ă V , which is spanned
by piecewise polynomial functions. For the results presented here, we have used a continuous
piecewise linear function space. The FEM allows great freedom in choosing the mesh, and in
particular allows us to use a very large mesh which is reﬁned in the region of the matter support.
The solutions constructed in this paper are done so on a variety of meshes which are chosen
according to the particular solution. Although we are exploring fully adaptive mesh schemes
presently, the meshes used here are generated a priori to match solution characteristics. In the
present work, we have typically taken the radius to be rb “ 50 for solutions with zero net angular
momentum and rb “ 100 for solutions with non-zero net angular momentum.

3.2 Numerical Integration

The evaluation of the matter terms Eq. (2.6) and Eqs. (2.10)–(2.13) appearing in the discretized
systems are evaluated using numerical integration; at each nodal point of the ﬁnite element mesh,
the matter terms are integrated numerically using a basic second-order accurate midpoint scheme
in both integration variables. The number of integration steps in each dimension is tuned for
numerical accuracy. We have typically used a value of 32 integration steps for the simulations in
the present paper.

3.3 Fixed-Point Iteration

The task of the numerics is to ﬁnd a self-consistent solution to Eqs. (2.5)–(2.6) in the Vlasov–
Poisson case, and Eqs. (2.15)–(2.18) with the matter terms Eqs. (2.10)–(2.13) in the Einstein–
Vlasov case. This is achieved with an iteration procedure in which the total mass is ﬁxed at
each iteration. We start by prescribing an initial guess for the potential U0, or the metric ﬁelds
ν, µ, B, and ω. These initial potentials are then used to compute the matter terms for a given
ansatz function with unit normalization constant K (cf. Eq. (2.4)). The constant K is ﬁxed by
the constraint that the total mass be the prescribed value. At this stage we have a coupled
set of linear elliptic equations for the gravitational potentials (U0 in the Vlasov–Poisson case,
and ν, µ, B, and ω in the Einstein–Vlasov case), which we solve using the ﬁnite element method
described above implemented in FEniCS [18, 19]. Once the linear system of equations has been
solved, the matter terms are evaluated, the constant K is ﬁxed once again, and the procedure is
iterated to convergence. The tolerance for convergence is set to 10´4.

Remark 3.4. Because the normalization constant K in the ansatz is changed at each step of the
iteration, the exact problem we solve is not determined until the end of the iteration. Although the
functional form of the ansatz ΦpE, Lzq is speciﬁed, it only becomes apparent in the iteration which
member of this family has the prescribed mass.

The initial guess for the above iteration may be either a rough estimate, or a previously
computed solution. Many solutions that our code obtains are robust against variations in the
initial guess. However, for the code to converge to more extreme solutions it may be required that
the initial guess is suﬃciently close. In such cases, the extreme solution is approached by ﬁrst
solving for a series of intermediate solutions. In certain cases a damped ﬁxed-point method is also
used to obtain convergence. Our code presently implements a linear damping scheme of the form

Xn “ p1 ´ θqXn´1 ` θYpXn´1q,

where X denotes the vector of degrees of freedom for the metric ﬁelds, Y denotes the ﬁxed-point
iteration, including solution of the linear system obtained by the ﬁnite element discretization, the
numerical integration and the rescaling of the constant K, and where θ P p0, 1s is a parameter.
By default, we set θ “ 1 and reduce the value of θ in cases when the ﬁxed-point iteration fails to
converge. In many cases, this extends the model regime for which solutions can be obtained.

Remark 3.5. In our numerical experiments in the axial symmetric case, as well as in a similar
algorithm implemented in spherical symmetry, we observe that the iteration appears to converge to
dynamically stable solutions. This is particularly evident in the spherically symmetric case, where
the stability of equilibrium solutions has been numerically investigated [14]. We also note that a
similar relation has been observed in the work of Andr´easson and Rein in the ﬂat case [20], where
a similar algorithm is used.

3.4 Consistency Checks

In the discussion above we focus on an implementation which uses Eq. (2.17) for the ﬁeld µ, rather
than the equation for ξ (cf. Eq. (2.19)). Indeed, because the form of Eq. (2.17) matches those for
the other metric ﬁelds (as well as Newtonian potential) we implement this equation in most of our

9

simulations. We have veriﬁed however that the same results are obtained if one instead integrates
Eq. (2.19).

Unlike the total mass of the solution, the total angular momentum is not prescribed, but rather
computed via Eq. (2.26) once the iteration has converged. During the iteration the boundary
condition for the ﬁeld ω is set to zero, introducing an error of 2J{r3
b in the numerical boundary
condition. For the rotating solutions we compute J „ 1.0 so this error is typically of the order
„ 10´6 if we take rb “ 100. What eﬀect does this have on the solution? To estimate this error we
consider the case of a rotating toroidal solutions with high angular momentum. On the one hand
we compute the solution with vanishing boundary conditions for the ω ﬁeld, and on the other we
iterate the solution procedure updating the angular momentum in the boundary condition based
on the value computed in the previous iterate. We do this until the computed angular momentum
converges to within a tolerance of 10´4. The error in the solution is estimated via the normalized
L2 norm of the diﬀerences of the metric ﬁelds. For the ω ﬁeld this error is 2.1 ¨ 10´2, (i.e. at the
one-percent level), while for the ν, µ and B ﬁelds it is order 10´5. Since the solution in which
the boundary value of the total angular momentum is iterated is much more computationally
expensive, and since the two solutions (with and without the iterated boundary conditions) diﬀer
only at the one percent level, and do not exhibit any signiﬁcant diﬀerences, we take J “ 0 on the
boundary (cf. Eq. (2.22)) in the remaining runs.

A further check on the numerics can be made by comparing the total mass and angular mo-
mentum computed with the integral expressions Eq. (2.24) and Eq. (2.26) with values read oﬀ
from the asymptotic behavior of the metric ﬁelds. More precisely we have [6]

Minf “ lim
rÑ8

1
2

rp1 ´ e2νq, Jinf “ lim
rÑ8

r3ωB2e´2ν.

We verify that the value Jinf computed from the expression above approaches the angular momen-
tum computed with Eq. (2.26) at some radius in between the radius of support and the domain
boundary. The error is a few percent for a domain of radius rb “ 100. Clearly, since the total
mass is prescribed and used in the boundary condition, the value Minf approaches M near the
boundary.
In our computations we take the total mass M “ 1, which is equivalent to scaling out of
the equations the only dimensionful quantity. However, we also check that the solutions scale as
expected when the prescribed mass is increased; that is, increasing M, while keeping the particle
mass ﬁxed at m “ 1, and simultaneously changing the parameter L0 to ML0, we ﬁnd the radius
of support and total angular momentum to increase according to r0 Ñ Mr0 and J Ñ M2J .

A good test for our code is in comparing to solutions obtained in [5, 6]. By modifying our ansatz
function to match that used by Shapiro and Teukolsky and appropriately scaling the solution
characteristics we ﬁnd agreement, for example, with the results of Table 2 in [5].

4 Results
In numerical results below we use an ansatz KΦpE, Lzq with a product structure

ΦpE, Lzq “ φpEqψpLzq,

(4.1)

with various choices of φ and ψ. If ψ is an even function, there are an equal number particles
rotating in each direction; the solution will then have zero net angular momentum. We also
consider ansatz functions for which ψpLzq vanishes for Lz ă 0, thus forcing all particles to have
angular momentum of the same sign. Solutions generated by such an ansatz have a net angular
momentum. While all of the ansatzes considered in this paper have this product structure, except
for the composite solutions considered in Section 4.5, which are the sum of such product ansatzes,
one does not generally have to make this choice.

4.1 Toroidal Solutions

We begin by presenting solutions generated by a four-parameter family of ansatz functions, which
generalize the well-known polytropic ansatz. These take the product form above with

and

The ansatz has four parameters, a cut-oﬀ energy E0, exponents k and l, and an angular
momentum cut-oﬀ L0. The choice of L0 “ 0 corresponds to the familiar polytropic solutions
(see for example [1]), and motivates calling this ansatz generalized polytropic. Energy-angular
momentum phase-space plots of the ansatz functions in four illustrative cases are found in Figure 1.
These four choices of the ansatz parameters allow us to demonstrate the basic dependence of the
solutions on the four parameters, and also to verify that the code gives reasonable results in the
well-studied spherically symmetric case. We illustrate these in the Einstein–Vlasov model with zero
net angular momentum, and note that the forms of the ansatz and corresponding spatial densities
are the same in the Einstein–Vlasov model with net angular momentum and in the Vlasov–Poisson
model. In the following section we investigate the limits of our method in producing relativistic
rotating toroidal conﬁgurations.

Figure 1 – Ansatz functions for the generalized polytropic solutions. GP-
A (Panel 1a) and GP-B (Panel 1b) are independent of Lz and result in
spherically symmetric solutions. GP-C (Panel 1c) and GP-D (Panel 1d)
break the spherical symmetry and generate spatial densities which vanish
at the axis or with vacuum at the axis respectively.

Solution parameters and characteristics for the four cases demonstrated here are collected in
Table 1. In Figure 2 we show the spatial density for a z “ 0 trace in the meridional plane. A

spherical distribution is obtained when all values of angular momentum are equally weighted by
the ansatz function, which can be see in cases GP-A and GP-B (generalized polytrope A and B
respectively). The solution GP-B is more centrally condensed than GP-A due to the fact that in
the ansatz function GP-B, higher energy particles are relatively suppressed. However, the radius
of support for these solutions is the same, and since these solutions are spherically symmetric, can
be determined from Eq. (2.33). For the solutions presented here E0 “ 0.925, and M “ 1, giving
R0 “ 13.853. Indeed, this value is observed in the solutions (see Table 1). We also note that the
solutions exhibited here are not very relativistic in the sense that the value 2M{R0 is far from the
Buchdahl bound of 8{9 [15, 16].

and M “ 1.0. The peak density wp occurs at coordinate value ρp. K is the coeﬃcient
appearing in the ansatz function. Eb and Zc are the normalized binding energy and central

The spherical symmetry can be broken by introducing dependence on Lz, either by increasing
l or L0. In the former case, GP-C, the peak density is shifted away from the coordinate origin
into a ring and the spatial density vanishes asymptotically at the center of the conﬁguration. The
latter case leads to a toroidal distribution with vacuum in the center; this is illustrated by GP-D,
where the density vanishes at approximately ρ « 2.25. We observe that the relationship Eq. (2.33)
between the cut-oﬀ energy and the radius of support does not generally hold in axisymmetry.

Since the rigorous existence of axisymmetric solutions to the Einstein–Vlasov system is known
only for solutions which are close to spherically symmetric Newtonian solutions, it is of interest
to investigate the limit of how relativistic solutions we are able to construct using the present
numerical method. We investigate this limit using a rotating version of the generalized polytropic
ansatz, taking L0 non-zero; that is, the ψpLzq-part of the ansatz takes the form

Lz ď L0.

(4.4)

This diﬀers from Eq. (4.3) in that only particles with positive angular momentum Lz are allowed.
In our trials with a number of diﬀerent ansatz functions, this ansatz – including the presence
of net rotation – was the most successful in constructing relativistic solutions.
In the present
paper we construct a sequence of solutions from the product ansatz given by Eqs. (4.2)-(4.4), with
decreasing E0 parameter. Plots of the density w for the more extreme members of a particular
sequence with parameters L0 “ 0.8, k “ l “ 0 are shown in Figure 3 below.

Figure 3 – Density plots for the limiting portion of a sequence of rela-
tivistic rotating toroidal solutions. The ansatz parameters in this case are
L0 “ 0.8 and k “ l “ 0.

Our most relativistic solution has parameters E0 “ 0.58, and L0 “ 0.8, k “ l “ 0. The actual
radius of support of this solution is found to be R0 “ 2.43 (cf. Figure 5 upper right panel), which
is less than the value R0 “ 2.96 which one would obtain via Eq. (2.33) in spherical symmetry.
Interestingly, we note that the non-spherically symmetric solutions in Table 1 have a radius of
support which is larger than that of the spherically symmetric ones. This property is likely caused
by the high angular momentum of this rotating solution. For spherically symmetric bodies, the
compactness 2M{R0 gives a good measure of how relativistic the solutions are. While the meaning
of this ratio is not as clear in axisymmetry, we note that the rotating toroidal solution which we
construct here has 2M{R0 “ 0.82, which is close to the limiting value in spherical symmetry of
8{9.
Perhaps a stronger indication that this sequence of solutions is relativistic is the presence of
ergoregions. An ergoregion is a region of a rotating spacetime in which the Killing vector ﬁeld Bt
is spacelike, forcing all causal observers to be dragged along in the direction of rotation. These

13

regions are familiar from the Kerr-family black holes. The solutions presented here, are however,
perfectly regular. As we show in Figure 4, the ergoregion begins to form within the matter at
around E0 “ 0.65 and grows, in subsequent solutions, to eventually contain the entire support of
the matter. These results lend strong support to the existence of solutions to the Einstein–Vlasov
system with ergoregions, a question which was left open in the only rigorous existence proof for
axisymmetric solutions [8]. Regular (non-black hole) solutions which contain ergoregions have
been numerically constructed before in the case of uniformly rotating ﬂuid models [21, 22, 23].

Figure 4 – The development of the ergoregion in the L0 “ 0.8 solution
family.

While the sequence of solutions discussed above leads to the solution with the lowest E0
parameter, we also investigate sequences with greater and lesser angular momentum, which we
control by adjusting the parameter L0. A comparison of diﬀerent solution characteristics for
families of solutions with L0 “ p0.5, 0.8, 0.9q is presented in Figure 5. As illustrated in Figure 5d,
the sequences with total angular momentum J greater than the mass M squared can be extended
to much lower E0 parameter values. In view of Remark 3.5 we conjecture that this is because
these solutions are in the super-extremal regime where no Kerr black holes exist, and therefore
may be stable, while the solution sequences with J ă M2 likely collapse to a Kerr black hole as
they become suﬃciently relativistic. In [24] it is concluded that all equilibrium toroidal solutions
studied in that paper are dynamically stable to black hole collapse. This is not in disagreement
with our conjecture and ﬁndings, since the solutions studied in [24] are not as relativistic as those
presented here.
It is interesting to note that the L0 “ 0.9 sequence, which has a larger angular momentum,
cannot be extended as far as the L0 “ 0.8 sequence. Beyond the terminal value of E0 “ 0.628,
the iteration fails to converge. This could indicate another boundary of the solution space, similar
to the mass-shedding limit observed in the uniformly rotating ﬂuid case [25], and it would be
interesting to pursue this question of why the iteration fails to converge further.

A related interesting open question is whether the sequences of relativistic and rotating toroidal
solutions to the Einstein–Vlasov system, which we present here, exhibit a quasi-stationary transi-
tion to the extreme Kerr black hole. Such a transition has been observed in the case of uniformly
rotating ﬂuids [25]. Evidence in favor of such a transition is provided by the approach of J{M2
to 1 as E0 is decreased, although additional studies which push this sequence to lower E0-values
must be performed. Another line of support is the shape of the ergoregion, which in the limit is
expected [25] to form two lobes in the meridional plane which meet at the axis of rotation. Studies
of this limiting behavior are ongoing.
We brieﬂy comment on the numerical aspects of constructing these solution sequences. The
solution mesh has a large radius (compared to the support of the matter) rb “ 50, which is highly
reﬁned near the coordinate origin. At each step of the sequence, the previous iterate is used as an
initial guess in the solver. To save computational costs, the solutions with E0 ą 0.75 (to the right
of the vertical dashed line in each panel of Figure 5) are not fully converged; the purpose of these
solutions is to obtain a suitable initial guess for the more relativistic solutions of greater interest.
Solutions with E0 ď 0.75 have converged with a tolerance of 10´4. Additionally, the amount of
damping in the ﬁxed-point iteration is increased in three stages by decreasing from θ “ 0.75 to

4.3 Disk-Like Solutions

From a point of view of astrophysics, in which the solutions discussed here can be thought of as
models for galaxies, it is interesting to investigate to what extent we can produce ﬂattened disk-
like spatial density distributions. While several authors have constructed disk-models in which the
matter is conﬁned to the plane [26, 20], our aim here is to ﬁnd fully three-dimensional solutions
whose spatial density distributions are as close to planar as possible.

In our numerical experiments we ﬁnd that the most ﬂattened disks are generated by an ansatz

having a Gaussian distribution in the angular momentum

(4.5)
In the limit L0 Ñ 8 the ansatz becomes independent of Lz, thus generating a spherically sym-
metric spatial density. As L0 is decreased, particles with higher angular momentum are more
heavily weighted compared to those with low angular momentum as shown in Figure 7. As before
the distribution is taken to have a product structure with a polytropic distribution for E as in
Eq. (4.2). An ansatz of this type has been considered in [5] for creating spindle-type densities
(by taking a negative sign in the exponential), and in [6] where rotating oblate solutions were
presented. The same authors also investigated an ansatz of this type in the Newtonian case in [4].

Figure 7 – Ansatz function φpEqψpLzq given by
Eq. (4.2) and Eq. (4.5), and with parameters chosen
as in EVR solution of Table 2. The ansatz gener-
ates solutions with net angular momentum since all
particles are restricted to rotate with the same orien-
tation.

Despite being the most ﬂattened solutions which we are able to produce, the density conﬁgu-
rations do not yet resemble the extremely ﬂattened galaxies which are observed in nature. For the
present paper, we ﬁrst illustrate, in the Einstein–Vlasov model, the extent to which we are able to
obtain ﬂattened solutions. Since the ansatz Eq. (4.5) is even, these solutions have zero net angular

16

momentum. We then compare disk-like solutions for the Vlasov–Poisson model (VP), and for the
Einstein–Vlasov model both in the case above with zero net angular momentum (EV), and in the
case where the ansatz Eq. (4.5) includes a momentum cutoﬀ so that all particles are rotating in
the same direction (EVR).

Figure 8 – L0-parameterized sequence of disk-like solutions in the
Einstein–Vlasov model with zero net angular momentum J “ 0.

Figure 8 shows the density for a family of oblate spheroids with a Gaussian distribution in
the angular momentum. The parameters are chosen E0 “ 0.942, k “ 1.5, l “ 0, and L0 is
decreased from L0 “ 10 to L0 “ 1.5. A deviation from spherical symmetry is only observed in
the last portion of this sequence beginning around L0 „ 2.8. Within this parameter range the
spatial density distribution stretches to its most ﬂattened form, while for parameters L0 ă 1.5 the
conﬁguration appears not to remain gravitationally bound.

The minimum L0 parameter for which the solution remains bounded depends, naturally, on
the other parameters of the model. In particular, if the parameter k is increased, leading to a more
centrally condensed spatial density distribution, then the L0 parameter can often be decreased
further, leading to a more ﬂattened and disk-like distribution. Through such investigations we
identify ﬂattened conﬁgurations for this ansatz in each of the models. A table comparing the
solution characteristics is presented in Table 2. The E0 parameters for these solutions were chosen
such that the radius of support for both the relativistic solutions and the Newtonian solution were
approximately equal.

Despite the similarity in the solution characteristics presented in Table 2, there are diﬀerences
in the character of the solutions in each case. As shown in the spatial density contour plots
Figure 9, at low densities the solutions are very similar, while at higher densities the solutions to
the Einstein–Vlasov equations have more ﬂattened contours. We note that none of the solutions
are particularly relativistic in terms of the parameter 2M{R0 „ 0.1.

At higher density contours the rotating relativistic solution also displays a central bulge and
a toroidal region. The peak density is at the origin, while the contours are toroidal only for
densities close to ninety percent of peak. We note that solutions obtained via a similar ansatz
were studied in [6]. In that study the authors present a family of solutions with a ﬁxed polytropic
exponent (here called k), and varied L0. For small L0 values, they ﬁnd that the peak density
occurs in a ring, rather than at the center.
In fact, the solutions presented in [6] contain no
central bulge. This diﬀerence in the character of the solutions is due to the polytropic ansatz,
which in [6] is chosen such that particles of all energies are weighted equally. In contrast, as shown

Einstein–Vlasov models with and without net rotation. The peak density, wp,
is in units of 10´3. Note, that in the Vlasov–Poisson case (VP) we use the same
symbol wp for the peak density, although in this case the density is obtained
from the expression Eq. (2.6) for w0.

Figure 9 – Panels (a)–(c) show density contours for values 10% through 90% of peak density
for the models VP, EV, and EVR respectively with parameters listed in Table 2.

in Figure 7, our ansatz suppresses higher energy particles. We also remark that one can obtain
toroidal like structures even in the Vlasov–Poisson model. Indeed, solutions obtained in [4] exhibit
such structure, where the choice of parameters in that paper corresponds to taking the polytropic
exponent k ă 0. However, since these solutions are less ﬂattened, we have not presented them
here.

Figure 10 – Two density contours for the disk-like solution in the EVR
model (see Table 2). Panels (a), (b) show the contours at 85% and 20%
of peak density respectively.

Our aim in studying disk-like solutions is to attempt to produce stationary models for disk
galaxies. We ﬁnd that the higher density regions of our solutions do in fact have the disk-like
appearance of real disk galaxies, while the lower density regions do not. Two diﬀerent spatial

density contours are presented for comparison in Figure 10. It would be very interesting to extend
this study of disk-like solutions to include other observable characteristics of galaxies, such as
velocity dispersion proﬁles and rotation curves.

4.4 Spindle Solutions

As a further test of our code and demonstration of diﬀerent ansatz functions, we present two
solutions with spindle-like spatial density distributions.

The ﬁrst of these solutions is based on a Gaussian distribution in angular momentum Eq. (4.5),
but with a negative sign in the exponential; see Figure 11, Panel (a). A sequence of stationary
solutions with this ansatz has been studied by Shapiro and Teukolsky in connection with the
formation of naked singularities [4, 5, 27]. Spindle conﬁgurations can also be constructed with a
distribution in momentum of the form
ψpLzq “

#

(4.6)

p1 ´ Q|Lz|ql,
0,

|Lz| ă 1{Q
|Lz| ě 1{Q,

which is illustrated Figure 11, Panel (b). This ansatz enforces an upper bound on Lz, controlled by
Q ą 0, which in turn forces particles to be close the axis. We refer to this choice as the polytropic–
spindle ansatz. For both of these ansatzes we use a polytropic distribution in the particle energy
Eq. (4.2). We compute both of these solutions in the Einstein–Vlasov case with equal numbers of
particles rotating in both directions. Similar solutions can be obtained with particles rotating in
only one direction, as well as in the Vlasov–Poisson case.

(a)

(b)

Figure 11 – Ansatz functions for spindle solutions. The Gaussian ansatz
is in Panel (a), and the Polytropic–Spindle ansatz is shown in Panel (b).

The parameters and characteristics of the solutions are shown in Table 3. In both solutions the
peak density occurs at the coordinate origin, while as shown in Figure 12, the Gaussian spindle
solution has particles which cluster more strongly on the axis and have a more pronounced spindle
shape.
The parameter E0 “ 0.966 (corresponding to R0 “ 30, cf. Eq. (2.33) above) is chosen to agree
with the parameter for the most extreme polytropic spindle solution in [5] (see Table 2). We note
that we are able to reproduce the solutions with R0 “ 30 in that table. The solution presented here
however makes the “democratic” choice k “ 0.0, giving equal weight to particles of all energies,
while the solutions in Table 2 of [5] use k “ 1.0.

4.5 Composite Spindle-Torus Objects

One of the strengths of our code is the ability to quickly implement new ansatz functions and
to treat composite models formed by summing together multiple ansatz functions. Examples of
composite astrophysical objects are numerous, and include disk galaxies with a central bulge,
galaxies with dark matter halos, and ring-type galaxies.

There are examples of composite models in the Newtonian case existing in the literature.
Fricke [28] expands the distribution in terms of the form pE0´ EqkL2n
for integers n. Toomre [29]
considers distributions of the form L2n
, which have vanishing density at the axis for non-
zero n, and increasingly ﬂattened peanut-shaped projections in the meridional plane for n ě 1.
Such models are combined to construct central bulge-disk and halo-disk conﬁgurations. Later,
Evans [30] shows that an axisymmetric logarithmic potential of Binney [31] can be constructed
from the sum of three of Toomre’s components. This result is then used in constructing composite
models with central stellar densities and dark halos. The existence of ﬂat stellar disks conﬁned to
a plane with dark matter halos is proved in the work of Fiˇrt et al. [32]. Composite models allow
for much more complexity in the density distributions, and greatly enlarges the space of solutions.
We demonstrate the capability of our code to handle multiple distributions by presenting a two-
component family of spindle-torus objects, which may provide models for ring-type galaxies. While
the above works are done in the Vlasov–Poisson model, to the authors’ knowledge the solutions
obtained here are the ﬁrst example of composite objects studied in the Einstein–Vlasov system.
Similar solutions may also be computed in the Vlasov–Poisson model.

The composite ansatz is taken to have the form

ΦpE, Lzq “ CsΦspindlepE, Lzq ` CtΦtoruspE, Lzq,

where ΦspindlepE, Lzq uses the polytropic-spindle ansatz introduced above Eq. (4.6), and ΦtoruspE, Lzq
uses a polytropic type ansatz with nonzero L0 (cf. Section 4.1). It is interesting to note that we
were not successful in combining any ansatz for the central object with a torus. Our initial at-
tempts of combining a polytropic central bulge with torus resulted in either a central bulge or a
torus, and both conﬁgurations only occurred simultaneously with signiﬁcant overlap.

Table 4 – Family of spindle-torus objects where the L0-parameter for the torus distribu-
tion is varied. The constants are taken to be Cs “ 0.5, Ct “ 1.0. The central density wc
is in units of 10´4. The total mass energy of each of the solutions is taken to be M “ 1.
The central, valley, and peak of torus densities are labeled wc, wv, wt respectively. We
let ρv and ρt denote the coordinate radius of the valley and peak of ring.

In Table 4 we exhibit members of a family of solutions parametrized by the L0 parameter for
the torus component. These solutions are computed using the Einstein–Vlasov solver, although
none of the solutions are relativistic in the sense of a high 2M{R0 value. The solutions shown
here have zero net angular momentum. For this simulation E0 “ 0.940. The parameters for the
spindle ansatz are ﬁxed to be Cs “ 0.5, Q “ 2, k “ 1, l “ 0, while for the torus component we
take k “ 1, l “ 1 and vary L0 between 1.8 and 1.3. Outside of this range, the density resides
nearly entirely in one of the components. Density proﬁles for three selections from the family are
presented in Figures 13a—13c. Although the solutions in Figure 13 exhibit a near-vacuum region
between the components, we have not been able to construct solutions which have a complete
vacuum in this region. In Table 4 we list the ratios of the central density to the density in the
valley between components, and the central density to the peak torus density. We note that the
L0 “ 1.6 solution has nearly equal central and torus-peak densities, and for this case the valley
density is approximately 3 times less dense. It is very likely that by further exploring the large
parameter space one can ﬁnd solutions with a more pronounced vacuum region separating the
components.
