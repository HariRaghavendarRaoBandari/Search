In this work we present a novel method to study phase transitions based on the complex zeroes
of a polynomial with coeﬃcients determined by the energy probability distribution. This is a
general method that brings advantages over the conventional Fisher zeroes approach since it does not
require the knowledge of the full density of states. The method was applied to a variety of classical
statistical physics models demonstrating its power in determining the transition temperature and
critical behavior. Our strategy can easily be adapted to any model, classical or quantum, once we
are able to build the corresponding energy probability distribution.

The study of phase transitions are of particular interest
due to its practical importance and theoretical richness.
Its understanding is the holy grail of thermodynamics
and has implications in almost all areas of physics. Un-
fortunately, only a few special cases are accessible to a
complete analytical description.
In face of that many
approximated techniques devoted to obtain the critical
parameters, like transition temperatures and exponents,
were developed along the years. Mean ﬁeld approxima-
tions and the renormalization group [1, 2] are two of those
approaches which have set remarkable advances in the
understanding of phase transitions. Yang and Lee [3] in-
troduced an alternative way to look to phase transitions
by using the concept of zeroes of the partition function,
that has shown to be a worthwhile ground to understand
it. Considering the complex fugacity plane, they showed
that the partition function zeroes density contains all the
relevant information about the thermodynamic system,
in particular they showed that in the thermodynamic
limit the density of zeroes completely determine the crit-
ical behavior of the system. In 1964 Fisher [4] extended
this idea to the complex temperature plane (Fisher ze-
roes).

In parallel to that the use of numerical techniques like
Molecular Dynamics, Spin Dynamics and Monte Carlo
grew dramatically following the accelerated development
of fast computers and mainly due to the development of
new algorithms. Of particular importance are the works
of Swendsen and Wang [5, 6] developed to reduce critical
slowing down in continuous transitions and multicanon-
ical methods (MUCA) [7–11] developed to overcome the
barrier between two coexisting phases in a ﬁrst order
transition. In addition, the use of histograms to obtain
the density of states (g(E)) have achieved an inconceiv-
able level of sophistication as compared to a few decades
ago. This advance has made it possible to obtain reliable
results for quantities as g(E) in the entire energy range
allowing a step forward in the description of phase tran-
sitions. The Broad Histogram [12, 13] and the Replica

Exchange Wang-Landau [14, 15] are among the state of
the art techniques leading those researches. Working to-
gether with ﬁnite size scaling it allows one to approach
the thermodynamic limit in a systematic and eﬃcient
way.

In this paper we introduce a new, general and eﬃ-
cient method based on the energy probability distribu-
tion (EP D) conjugated with an analogue of the Fisher
zeroes expansion of the partition function to precisely
determine the transition temperature and exponents of
a given system. The method has shown to be robust
to be successfully extended to any model and has great
potential to evoke further rigorous developments in our
understanding of phase transitions. In the following we
ﬁrst describe the Fisher’s zeroes approach. Next we de-
scribe how it can be combined with the EP D to obtain
the critical behavior of a system. We demonstrate the
reliability of the method by comparing our calculations
with exact results for the 2d Ising model [16]. Its power
is also demonstrated by calculating the critical proper-
ties for the 3, 6 and 10 states 2d Potts models [17], the
2d anisotropic Heisenberg model (XY model) [18–21],
and one elastic and ﬂexible polymer model [22]. Conse-
quently, we report all the most relevant types of tran-
sitions, since 6 and 10 states Potts models have a ﬁrst
order transition, 3 states Potts model has a second order
transition and the XY model has an inﬁnity order tran-
sition, also called Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
transition [18, 19]. Besides that, the method has shown
to be reliable to ﬁnd all transitions in a richer system,
for instance the 13 monomers polymer considered here.
This polymer has two pseudo transitions, solid-globule
and globule-coil, which can be identiﬁed as ﬁrst and sec-
ond order transitions respectively [23].

In the Fisher’s zeroes approach [4] a phase transition is
characterized by the appearance of a zero in the positive
real temperature axis in the thermodynamic limit reﬂect-
ing the non-analyticity of thermodynamic functions in a
phase transition. To make it clearer we should recall that

2

prohibitive. Moreover, for larger volumes the number of
energy states (the polynomial degree) increases dramat-
ically, making the zeroes ﬁnder task problematic. The
density of states spans over many orders of magnitude,
making it even worst. For instance, for a lattice size
96 × 96 in the 2d Ising model one has 9264 energy values
and g(E) spans over about 104 orders of magnitude. The
smallest polynomial coeﬃcient is g(1) = 2, the largest
one is g(4632) = 1.83 × 102772! At this point, one may be
tempted to consider only the most relevant coeﬃcients
of the polynomial, probably the largest ones. However,
these coeﬃcients are generally related to very high energy
states, unlikely to play any important role in the phase
transition. Then, it should be interesting if we could “ﬁl-
ter” the region where the dominant zero is located and
still have the relevant information about the phase tran-
sition. This, in fact, can be done in a systematic way as
we will show in the following.

To introduce our method note that if we multiply Eq. 1

by 1 = e−β0Eeβ0E it can be rewritten as

Zβ0 = X

hβ0 (E) e−E∆β,

E

Two Dimensional Ising Model. Here is shown for a 32 × 32
lattice. There are no zero in the real positive axis. The arrow
marks the dominant zero. As the lattice size augments this
zero converges to the real axis.

the partition function is given by [24]

(1)

where hβ0 (E) = g (E) e−β0E and ∆β = β − β0. Deﬁning
the variable x = e−ε∆β the partition function can be
written as polynomial in the form

were β = 1/kBT is the inverse temperature and we as-
sumed a discrete set of energies En = ε0 + nε with
n = 0, 1, 2, · · ·
[25]. This equation can be written as
a polynomial in z ≡ e−εβ and factorized as

Z = e−ε0β Y
n

(z − zn) .

For a ﬁnite system of volume Ld all zeroes are complexes
and we expect that some {z⋆(L) = a(L)+ib(L)} ∈ zj(L),
have the special property that b(L) → 0 as L → ∞ while
limL→∞ a(L) = a(∞), a constant positive value, charac-
terizing the phase transitions. To these zeroes we will
give the name dominant or leading zeroes.
In Fig. 1
it is shown part of the z plane for the 2d Ising model
zeroes distribution. The identiﬁcation of the dominant
zero, generally the nearest zero to the real positive axis,
is a way to locate the phase transition and determine the
pseudo-critical temperature.

Although the exact density of states, g(E), can be built
exactly only in few exceptional cases, methods like Wang-
Landau [14, 15] and Multicanonical [7–11] can give quite
good estimates. The main problem concerning these
methods is that in order to extract the relevant tran-
sition temperatures we have to build the entire map in
the complex z plane, as discussed above, demanding one
to construct the density of states in the whole energy
range. For simple models and moderate system sizes this
is not deterrent. However, as the volume of the system
grows, the computer time needed to build g(E) becomes

Zβ0 = e−ε0∆β X
n

hβ0(n)xn

(4)

where hβ0(n) = hβ0 (En) is nothing but the non normal-
ized canonical energy probability distribution (EP D),
hereafter referred to as the energy histogram at temper-
ature β0. The new polynomial has a new structure of
zeroes. Nevertheless, there is a one to one correspon-
dence between the Fisher zeroes and the EP D zeroes
since they are related through a conformal transforma-
tion. However, a detailed analysis of that is out of the
scope of the present work.

Considering the histogram at the transition tempera-
ture, β0 = βc, the dominant zero will be at xc = 1, i.e.,
Z = 0 at the critical temperature (∆β = 0) in the ther-
modynamic limit. For ﬁnite systems a small imaginary
part of xc is expected. Indeed, we may expect that the
zero that signalizes a phase transition is the one with
the smallest imaginary part on the real positive region
regardless β0. Hence, one may ﬁnd the critical temper-
ature by locating it and using its distance to the point
(1, 0) to obtain ∆β and then estimate βc.

With this in mind we have a clear criterion to ﬁlter the
important region of the energy space were the most rel-
evant zeroes are located. For temperatures close enough
to βc only states with non-vanishing probability to occur
are pertinent to the phase transition. Thus, for β0 ≈ βc
we judiciously discard small values of hβ0 without intro-
ducing relevant deviations in xc. This is the key aspect

of our method. Now, we can safely work in a reduced
energy range avoiding problems related to the sampling
of the entire energy range and the zeroes ﬁnder task for
very high degree polynomials with coeﬃcients spanning
over many orders of magnitude.

) = 1) at an initial guess β0

We can carry out the precedent reasoning in the fol-
lowing way: We ﬁrst build a normalized histogram hβ 0
(Max(hβ 0
0 considering a
≥ 10−2 to reduce the
threshold for the coeﬃcients as hβ 0
energy range considered. Afterward, we construct the
polynomial, Eq. 4, and perform the zeroes ﬁnder task.
As discussed before, by selecting the dominant zero, x0
c,
we estimate the critical temperature, β0
c . Regarding that
βc(L) is the true pseudo-critical temperature for the sys-
tem of size L, if the initial guess β0
0 is far from βc(L), pre-
sumably the estimative β0
c will not be satisfactory. Nev-
ertheless, we can make β1
0 = β0
c , build a new histogram
at this temperature and start over. After a reasonable
number of iterations we may expect that βj
c converges to
the true βc(L) and thus xj
c approaches the point (1, 0).
The property xj
c → (1, 0) can be used as a consistency
check in this iterative process. This suggests the follow-
ing algorithm to ﬁnd the pseudo-critical temperature:

1. Build a single histogram hβj

at βj
0.

2. Find the zeroes of the polynomial with coeﬃcients

given by hβj

3. Find the dominant zero, xj

c is close enough to the point (1, 0), stop.

b) Else, make βj+1

The convergency and accuracy of the method can be
tested by using the 2d Ising model. In Tab. I we show
the results for the Ising model for several lattice sizes.
For this we used the exact density of states [26] to build
normalized histograms at selected temperatures consid-
≥ 10−2, as discussed before.
ering a threshold of hβ 0
It is shown the result of a ﬁnite size scaling (estimate
entry) and the exact value up to 5 ﬁgures, showing
an error smaller than 2%. The zeroes distribution is
shown in Fig. 2. Other important quantity that can
be readily obtained is the temperature critical exponent
ν. As known, the ﬁnite size scaling theory predicts that
Tc(L) ∼ Tc + aL−1/ν and thus, we might expect that
xc(L) ∼ xc + bL−1/ν. Once ℜe{xc(L)} ≈ 1,
∀L, the
imaginary part of xc(L) should scale as L−1/ν. Using
this fact we can estimate 1/ν = 1.0059, very close to the
exact value, 1.

Using conventional Monte Carlo simulations with
Metropolis algorithm [27–29] we also simulate the 2d 3,
6 and 10 states Potts Models [17]. Here, we considered a
≥ 10−3. Again, convergence towards

circle and the real axis.

pseudo-critical temperature was achieved after a rela-
tively small number of iterations as shown in Fig. 3. For
the 3 states model, which has a second order phase tran-
sition, we found by a ﬁnite size scaling of the imaginary
part of xc(L) the exponent 1/ν = 1.19(1), in excellent
agreement with the exact value 6/5 = 1.2. For the critical
temperature we obtained 0.99491(7), again, in excellent
agreement with the exact value 0.99497. The 6 and 10
states models have a ﬁrst order phase transition. Using
ﬁnite size scaling we obtained the critical temperatures

0.80761 and 0.70123, for the 6 and 10 states models re-
spectively. The ﬁrst order character of these transitions
are evident from the double peak of histograms used to
obtain the zeroes, showing that our method is suitable
for both, ﬁrst and second order transitions.

Another test to our algorithm is the 2d anisotropic
Heisenberg model, also known as XY model, which has
a BKT transition [18, 19]. For these calculations, his-
tograms were calculated from the density of states ob-
tained by means of the Replica-Exchange-Wang-Landau
algorithm [25]. This model has a continuum energy spec-
tra and to overcome this we used a discretized energy set
such that En = nε + ε0 [25, 30]. Only the ﬁnal iteration
results are shown in Tab. II. The last line is the result
of ﬁnite size scaling which agree quite well with other
estimates (TBKT ≈ 0.700 [20, 21, 25])

As a ﬁnal test to our algorithm we considered a 13
monomer homopolymer, which is an intrinsically ﬁnite
system with two pseudo-transitions, a ﬁrst order one at
T1st ≈ 0.33520 followed by a second order transition at
T2nd ≈ 1.1292 [30]. Our results are in complete accor-
dance with those obtained in Ref. [30] and are depicted

in Tab. III. It is noteworthy that if we start the iteration
at T0 > T2nd or T0 < T1st they always converge to T2nd
or T1st respectively. If we use an intermediate value it
can converge to one or another. The borders of the basin
of convergence were not studied in this work.

In summary, we introduced a novel method to study
phase transitions based on the zeroes of the energy prob-
ability distribution. The method has shown to be fully
applicable to any model allowing accurate determination
of the critical temperatures and temperature exponent
(ν) as shown by our results on the Ising, Potts, Heisen-
berg and polymer models. The main advantage of the
method when compared to others is that it is interactive,
so that the transition temperature can be approached at
will. Beside that a full knowledge of the density of states
is not required. The polynomial we build has a few roots
with its coeﬃcients’ ranging in a civilized, narrow re-
gion, making the zeroes ﬁnder task non-problematic in
the present method. Other advantage of the method is
that ambiguities in the determination of pseudo-critical
temperatures existing in canonical analysis in intrinsi-
cally ﬁnite systems is removed as evidenced by the poly-
mer model studied here. Of course, much work is needed
to unleash the method in its full power. Indeed, rigorous
results and further numerical developments exploring its
details may turn it a standard approach in the study of
phase transitions.
