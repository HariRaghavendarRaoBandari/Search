Abstract. In this survey article we summarize the current state of research in representation
stability theory. We look at three diﬀerent, yet related, approaches, using (1) the category of FI
modules, (2) Schur-Weyl duality, and (3) ﬁnitely-generated modules over certain inﬁnite dimensional
vector spaces. The main example is the stability of representations of the symmetric group, though
there have also been some notable generalizations of representation stability to other groups. This
work summarizes the research that both authors engaged in over the course of the summer.

1. Introduction

Representation stability theory is the study of stable properties of representations of sequences
of abstract algebraic structures, e.g. groups, rings, algebras, etc. Given the recent wave of new lit-
erature, we endeavor to describe the current state of research, collecting the main results, examples,
and questions in the ﬁeld.

Recall that a representation of an algebra A is a homomorphism from A to the space of linear

maps on a vector space V ,

ρ : A → End(V ).

In a sense, understanding the representation theory of an algebra is equivalent to understanding
the algebra itself. But by focusing on the representations, often beautiful patterns are revealed in
otherwise intractable algebraic structures. Representation stability theory focuses on patterns that
stabilize for inﬁnite families of algebras, such as the group algebras for the symmetric groups Sn, as n
varies. In combinatorial representation theory, the representations are encoded using combinatorial
tools like partitions and tableaux. Rules for combining representations are then given in terms
of combinatorial data as well. Many of the favorite examples in representation stability are also
favorite examples in combinatorial representation theory, like for the symmetric group, but also
other Weyl groups, conﬁguration spaces, and diagram algebras. For more details on combinatorial
representation theory see ([BR]).

One major surge in the ﬁeld of representation stability theory came in the work of Church and
Farb in [ChFa], where they deﬁned representation stability in terms of consistent sequences to an-
swer a number of questions about homological stability, cohomology of groups, Lie algebras and

their homology, as well as combinatorics. They used their results to discuss not only representation
theory, but a variety of problems including counting problems and ﬁnite group theory. Church,
Ellenberg, and Farb then introduced the theory of FI-modules in [ChElFa1] to help explain rep-
resentation stability of the symmetric group. In [ChElFa2], the authors transformed questions of
stability into questions of ﬁnite generation. We outline the study of FI-modules and their general-
izations in Section 2. A list of ﬁnitely generated FI-modules can be found in Appendix A.

Around the same time, Sam and Snowden began their own study of representation stability, which
we discuss in Section 4. They took a similar approach to Church and Farb in [SaSn1] and studied the
algebraic structure of a category that they further developed in [SaSn3]. They answered questions
about how modules over twisted commutative algebras and their tensor products decompose. In
[SaSn1], Sam and Snowden draw on Schur-Weyl duality in order to study the symmetric group via
the downwards partition algebra. In [SaSn3] the authors point out that the category they developed
is equivalent to the category of FI-modules in characteristic 0.

Bowman, De Visscher, and Orellana tackled the problem in [BoDeOr] by studying the stability of
Kronecker coeﬃcients. These are the decomposition numbers for the tensor product of symmetric
group modules. As we explore in Section 3, Bowman, De Visscher, and Orellana utilize the Schur-
Weyl duality between the symmetric group, Sn, and partition algebra, Pk(n), transferring questions
of stability for varying Sn’s to invariance of Pk(n) with respect to its parameter n.

More classically, Murnaghan’s Theorem describes certain stability of Kronecker coeﬃcients ex-
plicitly.
In [Mur1] and [Mur2], Murnaghan studied the coeﬃcients of the decomposition of the
tensor product of two Sn-modules at length. Church, Farb, and Ellenberg re-proved Murnaghan’s
Theorem using their theory of FI-modules in [ChElFa2] and Wilson proved analogues of the the-
orem for the other Weyl groups of classical Lie type [Wil1]. Similarly, Bowman, DeVisscher, and
Orellana were able to give yet another proof using the representation theory of the partition algebra.
The Kronecker problem, that of giving positive combinatorial formulas for Kronecker coeﬃcients,
is one of the big open problems of the last century, so ﬁnding new approaches is of great interest
to the community.

Several generalizations have also arisen in short succession. As mentioned above, Wilson gener-
alized the theory of FI-modules by replacing the symmetric group by other Weyl groups of classical
Lie type in [Wil1] and [Wil2]. Putman and Sam studied categories in [PuSa] that are analogous to
FI-modules by replacing the action of the symmetric group with other ﬁnite linear groups. Prior
to the work of Church, Ellenberg, and Farb, Putman developed the notion of central stability in
[Put], which was shown to imply representation stability. Several researchers focused on exploring
the cohomology of speciﬁc spaces using these new tools by considering actions of varying symmetric
groups. In [Rol], Rolland used the theory of FI-modules to study the cohomology of pure mapping
classes. In [HeRe], Hersh and Reiner explored the cohomology of conﬁguration spaces. Nagpal dis-
cussed the cohomology of modular representations of symmetric groups in [Nag] using the theory
of FI-modules.

2. The FI-module approach

The development of FI-modules was precipitated by the work of Church and Farb [ChFa], in
which the authors introduced the notion of consistent sequences and a suitable deﬁnition of rep-
resentation stability to answer a number of questions about homological stability, cohomology of
groups, Lie algebras and their homology, as well as combinatorics. The following deﬁnitions are
given in terms of a family of groups {Gn}n∈N with a ﬁxed set of maps

G0 (cid:44)→ G1 (cid:44)→ G2 (cid:44)→ ··· ,

though they are largely motivated by the example where Gn = Sn is the symmetric group, with
the standard inclusion Sn (cid:44)→ Sn+1.
Deﬁnition. ([ChFa, Defn 1.1]) Let Vn be a sequence of Gn-representations, equipped with linear
maps φn : Vn → Vn+1, such that φn commutes with g, where g ∈ Gn acts on Vn+1 by its image
under the inclusion Gn (cid:44)→ Gn+1. Such a sequence is called consistent.
Now let {Vn} be a consistent sequence of Gn representations. The sequence {Vn} is representation
(1) Injectivity: The maps φ : Vn → Vn+1 are injective.
(2) Surjectivity: The span of the Gn+1-orbit of φn(Vn) equals all of Vn+1.
(3) Multiplicities: Decompose Vn into irreducible Gn-representations as

stable if, for suﬃciently large n, each of the following conditions hold.

Vn =
with multiplicities 0 ≤ cλ,n < ∞.

(cid:77)

λ

The theory of FI-modules, deﬁned as follows, was ﬁrst presented by Church, Ellenberg, and
Farb in [ChElFa1] to encode sequences of Sn-representations with linear maps that preserve group
structure.

Deﬁnition. An FI-module over a commutative ring R is a functor,

V : FI → R-Mod,

from the category whose objects are ﬁnite sets and whose morphisms are injective maps, to the
category of modules over R.

Note that the notion of FI-modules is more restrictive than that of consistent sequences presented
by Church and Farb in [ChFa]. Speciﬁcally, if we have a consistent sequence of Sn representation,
we can transform it into an FI-module if for all m ≤ n: given two permutations σ1, σ2 ∈ Sn and an
element v ∈ Vn, we have

σ1|{1,2,...,m} = σ2|{1,2,...,m} ⇒ σ1(v) = σ2(v).

2.1. Finite generation of FI-modules.

Deﬁnition. An FI-module is ﬁnitely generated if there is a ﬁnite set S of elements in(cid:96)

i Vi so that

no proper sub-FI-module of V contains S.

Several examples appear in A.

As we will see in Theorem 2.2, representation stability properties can be transferred to ﬁnite
generation properties of FI-modules, so it was important to establish the relation between those
two concepts. In order to do so, Church, Ellenberg, and Farb ﬁrst proved the Noetherian property of

4

ANASTASIA KHOMENKO AND DHANIRAM KESARI

certain FI-modules and then used it to link ﬁnite generation of those FI-modules to representation
stability of the corresponding Sn representations.

Theorem 2.1. ([ChElFa1, Thm 2.60]) (FI-modules are Noetherian) Let R be a Noetherian
ring containing Q. The category of FI-modules over R is Noetherian, that is, any sub-FI-module
of a ﬁnitely generated FI-module is ﬁnitely generated.

The relation between ﬁnite generation of FI-modules and representation stability is given by the

following theorem.

Theorem 2.2. ([ChElFa1, Thm 1.14]) (Finite generation vs Representation stability) An
FI-module V over a ﬁeld of characteristic 0 is ﬁnitely generated if and only if the sequence {Vn} of
Sn representations is uniformly representation stable (see [ChFa, Defn 2.3]), and each Vn is ﬁnite-
dimensional. In particular, for any ﬁnitely-generated FI-module V , we have for suﬃciently large n
a decomposition

Vn (cid:39)(cid:77)

cλV (λ)n.

2.2. Generalizations: FI-modules of other Lie types. Later, the theory of FI-modules was
extended by Wilson in [Wil1] and [Wil2] to include the representation stability of other classical
Weyl groups. Such FI-modules are denoted as F IW -modules in general (where W is a sequence of
either Sn or BCn or Dn groups) and F IA, F IBC and F ID in particular. For background on Weyl
groups of classical type see [Wil1, Section 2]

Just as in the symmetric group (type A) case, Wilson showed that ﬁnite generation of F IBC-
and F ID-modules is equivalent to representation stability (as deﬁned in [ChFa]) of BCn and Dn
([Wil1]). Wilson also proved that the restriction of a ﬁnitely generated F IW -module preserves ﬁnite
generation.
Deﬁnition. ([Wil1, Defn 1.3] An F IW -module is ﬁnitely generated in degree ≤ d, if it has a ﬁnite
generating set {vi} with vi ∈ Vmi, for some ﬁnite sequence of integers {mi}, where mi ≤ d for each
i.

Let W , W be families of Weyl groups such that Wn ⊆ W n.

Deﬁnition. ([Wil1, Defn 3.21] Given a family of inclusions Wn (cid:44)→ W n, any FIW -module V inherits
the structure of an F IW -module by restricting the functor V to the subcategory FIW in FIW . We
call this restriction ResW

W V the restriction of V to F IW .

Proposition 2.3. ([Wil1, Proposition 3.22]). (Restriction preserves ﬁnite generation) For
each family of Weyl groups W ⊂ W , the restriction ResW
W V of a ﬁnitely generated F IW -module V
is ﬁnitely generated as an F IW -module. Speciﬁcally, we have the following.
1. Given an F IBC-module V ﬁnitely generated in degree ≤ m, ResBC
F IA-module in degree ≤ m.
2. Given an F IBC-module V ﬁnitely generated in degree ≤ m, ResBC
F ID-module in degree ≤ m.
3. Given an F ID-module V ﬁnitely generated in degree ≤ m, ResD
F IA-module in degree ≤ m + 1.

D V is ﬁnitely generated as an

A V is ﬁnitely generated as an

She also showed that induction respects generation and relation degree. The natural embeddings

Sn (cid:44)→ Dn (cid:44)→ BCn provide us with the inclusions of categories,
F IA (cid:44)→ F ID (cid:44)→ F IBC.

Deﬁnition. An FI module V has relation degree ≤ r if there exists a surjection

d(cid:77)

M (Wi) (cid:16) V,

i=0

whose kernel K is generated in degree ≤ r.
Theorem 2.4. ([Wil1, Cor 3.28]) (Induction preserves ﬁnite generation). Suppose V is a
ﬁnitely generated F IW -module with degree of generation ≤ g and relation degree ≤ r. Then IndW
W V
is also ﬁnitely generated, with generation degree ≤ g and the relation degree ≤ r.

The above result provided the suﬃcient groundwork to show that the dimensions of ﬁnitely
generated FIBC- and FID-modules over arbitrary ﬁelds are eventually polynomial, and to prove
the Noetherian property for FIBC- and FID-modules. The latter extends the theorem about ﬁnite
generation and representation stability proved by Church, Ellenberg, and Farb in [ChElFa1] to
include sequences of BCn and Dn groups. This result, as well as speciﬁc stable ranges, is presented
in the two following theorems.
Deﬁnition. Let V be an FI-module over a ﬁeld of characteristic 0. We say that V has weight ≤ d
if for every n ≥ 0 and every irreducible constituent V (λ)n of Vn, we have |λ| ≤ d.
Theorem 2.5. ([Wil1, Thm 4.27]) (Finitely generated FIW -modules are uniformly repre-
sentation stable). Suppose that F is a ﬁeld of characteristic 0, and Wn is Sn, Dn, or BCn.
Let V be a ﬁnitely generated FI-module. Take d to be an upper bound on the weight of V , g an
upper bound on its degree of generation, and r an upper bound on its relation degree. Then Vn is
uniformly representation stable with respect to the maps induced by the natural inclusions

In : n (cid:44)→ (n + 1),

stabilizing once n ≥ max(g, r) + d; when Wn is Dn and d = 0, we need the additional condition that
n ≥ g + 1.
Theorem 2.6. ([Wil1, Thm 4.28]) (Uniformly representation stable FIW -modules are ﬁnitely
generated). Suppose conversely that V is an FIW -module, and that {Vn, (In)∗} is uniformly rep-
resentation stable for n ≥ N , where (In)∗ is the following inclusion, (In)∗ : Vn (cid:44)→ Vn+1. Then V is
ﬁnitely generated in degree ≤ N.

After obtaining this result, in her next paper [Wil2], Wilson provided a speciﬁc stable range of
sequences of Wn-representations, such as cohomology groups of pure string motion groups P Σn
and complexiﬁed complements MW (n) of the reﬂecting hyperplanes of Wn, that are associated
with FIW -modules. She also proved that the characters of these representations are generated by
polynomials.

Theorem 2.7. ([Wil2, Thm 1.1])(Polynomiality of characters). Let Wn denote Sn, Bn, or
Dn. Let Xn denote either the sequence of pure string motion groups P Σn or the complexiﬁed
complements MW (n) of the reﬂecting hyperplanes of Wn. Then, in each degree i the sequence of
cohomology groups of such sequences {H i(Xn; Q)} is an FIW -module ﬁnitely generated in degree
≤ 2i. Then,

(1) the sequence {H i(Xn; Q)} is uniformly representation stable, stabilizing for n ≥ 4i; and
(2) for all values of n, the characters of {H i(Xn; Q)} are given by a unique character polynomial

of degree at most 2i.

Additionally, Wilson proved that the characters BCn-representations in the cohomology rings of
pure string motion groups H∗(P Σ•; R) are given by a polynomial whose degree is bounded from
above.
Corollary 2.8. ([Wil2, Cor 5.6]) Fix an integer i ≥ 0. The character of the sequence of Bn-
representations {H i(P Σn; Q)}n are given by a unique character polynomial of degree ≤ 2i for all
values of n.

The ﬁrst theorem of the paper extended the work of Church ([Chu, Thm 1]) by providing the

2.3. Other techniques resulting from the theory of FI-modules. The development of FI-
modules gave rise to other techniques used to prove representation stability of the symmetric group

of the Sn-representations given by cohomology of conﬁguration spaces in Rd.
speciﬁc n for which the Sn-representations in H i(Conf(n, Rd)) stabilize sharply.
Theorem 2.9. ([HeRe, Thm 1.1]) Fix integers d ≥ 2 and i ≥ 1. Then H i(Conf(n, Rd)) vanishes
unless d − 1 divides i, in which case it stabilizes sharply at
d−1 for d ≥ 3 odd,

This result was achieved by recasting the cohomology groups H i(Conf(n, Rd)) in terms of higher
Lie characters Lieλ when d is odd, and the Whitney homology of the lattice Πn of set partitions of
{1, 2, ..., n}, when d is even. This was done the following way

lattice Πn of set partitions of {1, 2, ..., n} ([HeRe, section 2.4]).

The latest development of the study of FI-modules brings us the result obtained by Li in ([L,
Thm 1.17]) which provides us with information about an upper bound of homological degree of
ﬁnitely generated FI-modules,

Deﬁnition. The ith homological degree of V and is deﬁned as follows:

hdi(V ) = sup{m ∈ Z+ | the value of Hi(V ) on m is not 0}

A SURVEY OF REPRESENTATION STABILITY THEORY

Theorem 2.11. ([L, Thm 1.17])

Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic 0, and let V be a ﬁnitely generated FI-module. Then for i ≥ 1,

hdi(V ) ≤ max{2gd(V ) − 1, td(V )} + i,

where gd(V ) is the homolological degree hd0(V ), and td(V ) is the torsion degree of V .

In [Ra], Ramos extended the results in [ChElFaNa, Thm B] to F IG-modules and provided speciﬁc

bounds for the stable range of these modules.
Deﬁnition. A G-map between sets R and S is a pair (f , ρ), where f : R → S and ρ : R → G.
Deﬁnition. Let FAG be the category whose objects are ﬁnite sets and whose morphisms are G-
maps. Then deﬁne FIG to be the subcategory where the function f is injective.

Theorem 2.12. ([Ra, Thm D]) (Stable range of FIG-modules) Let G be a ﬁnite group, and let
V be a ﬁnitely generated FIG-module over a ﬁeld F. Then the stable range of V ≥ r + min{r, d},
where r is the relation degree of V and d is the degree of the 0th homology H0(V ).

2.4. Extending the theory of FI-modules. In [PuSa], Putman and Sam constructed analogues
of FI-modules, where the role of the symmetric groups is played by the general linear groups and the
symplectic groups over ﬁnite rings. The Asymptotic Structure Theorem established an analogue
of the Noetherian property of FI-modules. The results of [PuSa] demonstrated the importance of
Noetherianity over ﬁnitely generated rings.
Deﬁnition. [Put, Central stability.] For each n, let Vn be a representation of Sn over a ﬁeld F,
and let φn : Vn → Vn+1 be a linear map which is Sn-equivariant. We will call the sequence

φ1−→ V2

φ2−→ V3

φ3−→ V4

φ4−→ . . .

V1

φn−1−−−→ Vn) and φn is the natural map Vn → C(Vn−1

a coherent sequence of representations of the symmetric group if it forms a sequence of equivariant
linear maps. The central stabilization of φn−1, denoted C(Vn−1
φn−1−−−→ Vn), is the Sn+1-representation
which is the largest quotient of IndSn+1
Sn Vn such that (n, n+1) acts trivially on the image of Vn−1.We
will say that our coherent sequence is centrally stable starting at N ≥ 2 if for all n ≥ N , we have
Vn+1 = C(Vn−1
Deﬁnition. [PuSa] Let R be a ring. A linear map between free R-modules is splittable if its
cokernel is free. Let V I(R) be the category whose objects are ﬁnite-rank free R-modules and
whose morphisms are splittable injections. For V ∈ V I(R), the monoid of V I(R)-endomorphisms
of V is GL(V ). Thus if M is a V I(R)-module, then MV is a representation of GL(V ) for all
V ∈ V I(R).
Theorem 2.13. [PuSa, Theorem A] Let R be a ﬁnite ring. The category of V I(R)-modules is
Noetherian.

φn−1−−−→ Vn).

Putman and Sam deﬁned two other categories, namely the categories V IC and SI. Interested
readers should visit [PuSa, Section 1] for the deﬁnitions of these categories. They also proved
Noetherianity for the category OV IC(R) in [PuSa, Section 2.3]. Ultimately, the authors showed
that both of these are Noetherian. The authors generalized their results by proving the Asymptotic
Structure Theorem.
It should be noted that Church, Farb, Ellenberg, and Nagpal studied the
asymptotic structure of FI-modules in [ChElFaNa]. The Asymptotic Structure Theorem Putman
and Sam proved is able to provide a broadened approach to many of the ideas explored in the study
of F I-modules.

8

ANASTASIA KHOMENKO AND DHANIRAM KESARI

Deﬁnition. [PuSa] A weak complemented category is a monoidal category (A, (cid:126)) satisfying the
following.
(1) Every morphism in A is a monomorphism. Thus for all morphisms f : V → V (cid:48), it makes sense
(2) The identity object 1 of (A, (cid:126)) is initial, i.e. for V , V (cid:48) ∈ A there exist natural morphisms

to talk about the subobject f (V ) of V (cid:48).
V → V (cid:126) V (cid:48) and V (cid:48) → V (cid:126) V (cid:48), and thus the compositions

∼=−→ V (cid:126) 1 → V (cid:126) V (cid:48)

V

and

V (cid:48) ∼=−→ 1 (cid:126) V (cid:48) → V (cid:126) V (cid:48).

We will call these the canonical morphisms. Note the following.
(1) For V , V (cid:48), W ∈ A, the map

HomA(V (cid:126) V (cid:48), W ) → HomA(V, W ) × HomA(V (cid:48), W ),

obtained by composing morphisms with the canonical morphisms, is an injection.

(2) Every subobject C of an object V has a unique complement. So, a subobject D of V such that

∼=−→ V , where the compositions C → C (cid:126) D

there is an isomorphism C (cid:126) D
C (cid:126) D

∼=−→ V and D →
∼=−→ V of the isomorphism with the canonical morphisms are the inclusion morphisms.
Deﬁnition. [PuSa] A complemented category is a weak complemented category (A, (cid:126)) whose
monoidal structure is equipped with a symmetry.
Deﬁnition. [PuSa] If (A, (cid:126)) is a monoidal category, then a generator for A is an object X of A
such that all objects V of A are isomorphic to Xi for some unique i ≥ 0. We will call i the X-rank
of V .

The following theorem is a major result of [PuSa] since it generalizes the criteria for Noetherianity.
Theorem 2.14. [PuSa, Theorem E] Let (A, (cid:126)) be a complemented category with generator X.
Assume that the category of A-modules is Noetherian, and let M be a ﬁnitely generated A-module.
Then the following hold. For N ≥ 0, let AN denote the full subcategory of A spanned by elements
whose X-ranks are at most N.
(1) (Injective representation stability) If f : V → W is an A-morphism, then the homomorphism
Mf : MV → MW is injective when the X-rank is suﬃciently large.
(2) (Surjective representation stability) If f : V → W is an A-morphism, then the orbit under
AutA(W ) of the image of Mf : MV → MW spans MW when the X-rank is suﬃciently large.
(3) (Central stability) For N (cid:29) 0, the functor M is the left Kan extension to FI of the restriction
of M to AN .

They are able to prove a version of this theorem that is speciﬁc to FI-modules based on the work

in [ChElFaNa] where A is FI and the generator X is {1} of the prior theorem.

As the authors noted, their approach to proving the Noetherian property works speciﬁcally for

categories over ﬁnite rings.
Theorem 2.15. [PuSa, Theorem M] For C ∈ {V I(Z), V IC(Z), SI(Z)}, the category of C-modules
is not Noetherian.

3. The centralizer algebra approach

One particularly elusive question in representation theory addresses the Kronecker coeﬃcients,
the decomposition numbers for the tensor product of two symmetric group modules. Namely, if we
write Sλ for the irreducible Sn representation indexed by the partition λ, then in

Sλ ⊗ Sµ =

cν
λ,µSν,

λ,µ ∈ Z≥0,
cν

(cid:77)

ν(cid:96)n

the coeﬃcients cν
λ,µ are Kronecker coeﬃcients. One major contribution to this open question is
Murnaghan’s Theorem, describing their behavior for varying symmetric groups. In Bowman, De
Visscher, and Orellana’s study of representation stability theory in [BoDeOr], the authors focused
on these coeﬃcients. In [SaSn5] Sam and Snowden were able to prove Stembridge’s Conjecture, a
conjecture that generalizes Murnaghan’s Theorem. The Kronecker problem, ﬁnding a combinato-
rially positive formula for the Kronecker coeﬃcients remains frustratingly open. In [BoDeOr], key
insights are provided.

3.1. Schur-Weyl Duality. Schur-Weyl duality oﬀers a diﬀerent lens through which we can study
the symmetric group. The original result establishes the relationship between irreducible ﬁnite-
dimensional representations of the general linear and symmetric groups. Schur found that the
general linear group GLn(C) = GLn and the symmetric group Sk have commuting actions on the
k-fold tensor product (Cn)⊗k = Cn ⊗ . . . ⊗ Cn, where the general linear group acts diagonally and
the symmetric group acts by permuting factors. Extending these actions linearly to the respective
group algebras, these actions fully centralize each other in End(V ⊗k), which yields the multiplicity-
free decomposition

(Cn)

⊗k =

Gλ ⊗ Sλ

as a (CGLn, CSk)-bimodule,

(cid:77)

λ∈Λ

where Λ is the set of integer partitions of k with no more than n parts, Sλ is an irreducible Sn
module, and Gλ is an irreducible GLn module. Thus we have a pairing general linear and symmetric
group modules; namely, for each k ∈ Z≥0 and partition λ of k of length less than n, there is a distinct
ﬁnite dimensional irreducible representation of GLn.
3.2. The Partition Algebra. Like CSk is the centralizer of the diagonal action of CGLn on
(Cn)⊗k, the partition algebra Pk(n) is the centralizer algebra of the diagonal action of CSn on
(Cn)⊗k, where Cn is now the n-dimensional permutation representation of Sn. The corresponding
(Pk(n), CSn)-bimodule decomposes as

(Cn)⊗k =

P µ ⊗ Sµ,

(cid:77)

where Λ is the set of integer partitions of {1, . . . , k} with ﬁrst part no longer than n/2, P µ is an
irreducible Pk(n)-module, and for µ ∈ Λ, µ is the partition (n − |µ|, µ1, µ2, . . . ). For example, if

µ =

and

n = 15,

then

¯µ =

Bowman, DeVisscher, and Orellana rigorously formulate the representation theory of this bimodule
in Section 2 of [BoDeOr].

The partition algebra Pk(n) also has a remarkable description as a diagram algebra. Namely, it
is the algebra with basis indexed by diagrams on 2k vertices: plane graphs with k vertices on top, k

vertices on bottom, and edges connecting vertices to represent connected components corresponding
to a set partition of the 2k vertices. For example,

Composition of diagrams is performed as follows: place d1 above d2, connect the bottom vertices
of d1 with the top vertices of d2 and remove all the connected components that are completely
situated in the middle of the two diagrams. For example, if d1 and d2 are as above, then

d1 ◦ d2 =

Then multiplication is given by d1d2 = nl(d1 ◦ d2), where l is the number of removed components.
See, for example, [HaRa, Section 2].

A useful tool for encoding the duality between the symmetric group and partition algebra is
the Bratteli diagram. The ﬁrst few levels of the Bratteli diagram for generic n are presented in
Figure 1. The paths from ∅ at the 0th level to a point λ on the kth level provide a basis for the simple
k (n), for n ≥ 2k. Therefore, they record the multiplicity of Sλ in a decomposition
Pk(n)-module, P λ
of (Cn)⊗k as a Sn-module for n ≥ 2k. In particular, for n ≥ 2k, the representations of Pk(n) are
independent of n.

The goal of Bowman, De Visscher, and Orellana in [BoDeOr] is to pass questions about the
stability of the Kronecker coeﬃcients to the partition algebra. They are thus able to oﬀer an
alternative approach to Murnaghan’s Theorem stemming from stability of Pk(n) with respect to
varying the parameter n, i.e. the representation theory of Pk(n) is largely independent of n. The
authors oﬀered a procedure for how to calculate the Kronecker coeﬃcients through the partition
algebra, providing speciﬁc closed formulas for hook and two-part partitions.

Just as Wilson proved analogues of Murnaghan’s Theorem for the other Weyl groups, a natural
question is to consider how this approach can be adapted to the other Weyl groups. It may also
be interesting to use the Schur-Weyl duality between the symmetric group and partition algebra
to study the representation theory of FI-modules through the lens of the partition algebra, since
the partition algebra is largely n invariant. In the following section, we will see Sam and Snowden
make use of the Pk(n), CSn-bimodule as well.

4. The twisted commutative algebra approach

Sam and Snowden approached the problem of describing representation stability [SaSn1] by
analyzing modules over twisted commutative algebras (TCAs). They summarize their investigation
of TCAs in [SaSn2] and oﬀer several equivalent deﬁnitions for TCAs and the modules over them.

Deﬁnition. [SaSn2, Deﬁnition 1] A twisted commutative algebra is a rule which associates to each
vector space V a commutative ring A(V ), and to each linear map of vector spaces V → V a ring
homomorphism A(V ) → A(V ).

Many TCAs satisfy the Noetherianity property making their representation theory tractable. In
fact, Nagpal, Sam and Snowden have recently explored the Noetherian property over twisted com-
mutative algebras in greater detail in [NaSaSn], speciﬁcally the Noetherianity of Sym(Sym2(C∞)).
A particularly interesting TCA is A = Sym(C(cid:104)1(cid:105)), the symmetric algebra over the vector space
In [SaSn1], the authors note that the TCA Sym(C(cid:104)1(cid:105)) is studied by Church, Farb, and
C∞.
Ellenberg as FI-modules.
In [ChElFa1], the authors state that ”FI-modules can be viewed as
modules for the ‘exponential’ twisted commutative algebra”. This TCA is studied at length in
[SaSn1]. Some important structural results include the following.

Theorem 4.1. [SaSn1, Cor 4.2.6] Projective A-modules are also injective.

Theorem 4.2. [SaSn1, Thm 4.3.1] Every object of M odA has ﬁnite injective dimension.

In [SaSn3], Sam and Snowden gave a category theoretic approach to representation stability.

They deﬁned the stable representation category, Repst(G∗), and a specialization functor,

Γd : Repst(G∗) → Rep(Gd),

mapping the stable representation category to the representation category for some group, Rep(Gd).
Their approach ﬁrst examined the structure of the stable representation category and then ex-
amined the structure of the specialization functor. They did this for ﬁve families of groups: (1) the

12

ANASTASIA KHOMENKO AND DHANIRAM KESARI

general linear groups, GLn, (2) orthogonal groups, On, (3) symplectic groups, Spn, (4) symmetric
group Sn, and (5) the general aﬃne group, GAn. They noted that although the results for each
group are very similar, they have no uniﬁed theory.

This paper also laid the foundation for future combinatorial analysis of the categories Sam
and Snowden established.
In particular, the authors used relationships established via Schur-
Weyl Duality to study GLn, On, and Spn via Brauer algebras and symmetric groups vis partition
algebras.This approach echoed that of Bowman, De Visscher, and Orellana in [BoDeOr], who used
the stability of the partition algebra to study the Kronecker coeﬃcients. A major result of [SaSn3]
was the use of the duality between the symmetric group and partition algebra to describe the
inﬁnite symmetric group, and also establishing the upwards and downwards partition categories,
denoted (up) and (dp) respectively, to aid in their analysis. This led to one of the paper’s most
important results. Sam and Snowden deﬁne (up) and (dp) as the following.

Deﬁnition. [SaSn3, Section 6.]
(6.3.8) The downwards partition category has objects that are
ﬁnite sets. A morphism L → L(cid:48) is a partition of L (cid:113) L(cid:48) in which each part meets L. Given a
morphism L → L(cid:48) represented by U and a morphism L(cid:48) → L(cid:48)(cid:48) represented by U(cid:48)(cid:48), the composition
L → L(cid:48)(cid:48) is represented by the partition obtained by gluing U and U(cid:48)(cid:48) along L(cid:48) and merging parts
which meet. The upwards partition algebra has everything reversed.

In [SaSn3][§ 2.1.2], the authors let A be an abelian category and the representation of Λ is the
functor Λ → A. Let AΛ be the category of representations. The kernel, K is an object of AΛ. The
contravariant functors Φ and Ψ are given in [SaSn3][§ 2.1.10] by

Φ : Modf

Λ → A, Φ(M ) = HomΛ(M,K)
(dp) as the objects of Mod(dp) that are of ﬁnite length. Let Rep(Sn) be the algebraic

and Ψ : A → ModΛ, Ψ(N ) = HomA(N,K).

Deﬁne Modf
representations of the symmetric group and let

Φ : Modf

(dp) → ModSn,

and

Ψ : ModSn → Mod(dp).

Theorem 4.3. [SaSn3, Thm 6.3.30] The functors Φ and Ψ induce mutually quasi-inverse con-
travariant equivalences of tensor categories between Rep(Sn) and Modf

(dp).

This theorem shows that the categories Rep(Sn) and Modf

(dp) are essentially equivalent, thereby
establishing the relation between the category of representations of Sn and the ﬁnitely generated
modules of downward-partition algebra.

In [SaSn4], the authors employed a combinatorial approach to studying certain properties of
representations, such as Noetherianity, via combinatorial data. This work discussed a variety of in-
teresting phenomena. In particular, we highlight results concerning TCAs in positive characteristic
and analogues of the category FI.

Deﬁnition. [SaSn4] Let F Id be the category whose objects are ﬁnite sets. Given two ﬁnite sets S
and T , a morphism S → T is a pair (f , g) where f : S → T is an injection and g : T f (S) → {1, ..., d}
is a function.

The authors were able to apply the results to several groups which served to illuminate the
structure of those groups. Two such theorems are listed below but the authors are able to prove
several more.
Theorem 4.4. [SaSn4, Cor 7.1.3] If R is left-Noetherian then RepR(F Id) is Noetherian.
Theorem 4.5. [SaSn4, Cor 7.3.6] A TCA over a noetherian ring R ﬁnitely generated in degree 1
is Noetherian.
