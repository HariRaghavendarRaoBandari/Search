Abstract

The minimum-eﬀort coordination game, having potentially important implications in both evolutionary

biology and sociology, draws recently more attention for the fact that human behavior in this social dilemma

is often inconsistent with the predictions of classic game theory. In the framework of classic game theory,

any common eﬀort level is a strict and trembling hand perfect Nash equilibrium, so that no desideratum is

provided for selecting among them. Behavior experiments, however, show that the eﬀort levels employed

by subjects are inversely related to the eﬀort costs. Here, we combine coalescence theory and evolution-

ary game theory to investigate this game in ﬁnite populations. Both analytic results and individual-based

simulations show that eﬀort costs play a key role in the evolution of contribution levels, which is in good

agreement with those observed experimentally. Besides well-mixed populations, set structured populations,

where the population structure itself is a consequence of the evolutionary process, have also been taken into

consideration. Therein we ﬁnd that large number of sets and moderate migration rate greatly promote eﬀort

levels, especially for high eﬀort costs. Our results may provide theoretical explanations for coordination

behaviors observed in real life from an evolutionary perspective.

INTRODUCTION

In game theory, coordination games are a class of games with multiple Pareto-ranked equilibria

in which players choose the same or corresponding strategies [1–5]. For those macroeconomists

who believe that an economy may become mired in a low-output equilibrium, the coordination

game is a particularly important paradigm [6, 7]. It is also worth noting that coordination game

has a potentially important application to evolutionary biology [6, 8, 9]. In addition, the coor-

dination model helps to explain the puzzle why cooperative behavior can emerge when only the

ﬁttest survive: for example, punishment, an important mechanism that restricts selﬁsh behavior,

in fact transforms social dilemmas (such as prisoner’s dilemma game or public goods game) into

coordination games [10–13].

In the minimum-eﬀort coordination game (MECG), which captures key features of the kinds

of coordination problems faced by ﬁrms, the common part of the payoﬀ is determined by the

minimum decision [1, 14–18]. Two players choose “eﬀort levels” from an available strategy set

and both have to perform a costly task to raise the joint production level. Each player’s payoﬀ is the

minimum of the two eﬀorts minus the cost of its own eﬀort. When a player with an eﬀort level p1
encounters an opponent with p2, the former gains the payoﬀ P(p1, p2) = min(p1, p2) − κp1, where
κ < 1 is a cost parameter. Apparently, any common eﬀort constitutes a Nash equilibrium, and

without further reﬁnement the Nash equilibrium concept provides little predictive power [1, 16, 19,

20]. The lowest eﬀort level corresponds to the least eﬃcient or risk-dominant equilibrium and the

highest eﬀort level corresponds to the Pareto-optimal or payoﬀ-dominant equilibrium [1, 14, 15].

In the classic game theory, the set of Nash equilibria is obviously unaﬀected by changes in the

eﬀort cost or the number of players [1, 14, 16].

However, in the MECG experiments, the observed behaviors deviate from the results predicted

by game theory [21]. In general, the cost parameter κ plays a decisive role in the eﬀort level:

Behavior is concentrated close to the highest eﬀort level when κ is low, whereas high values of

κ lead to a dramatic declining of the mean contribution level. In some behavior experiments, al-

though coordination can be improved by introducing other interaction mechanisms [22–25], large

cost continuously obstructs the stabilization of high level eﬀorts. It is noteworthy that standard

deterministic evolutionary game theory [26], as well as classic game theory, can not present ex-

planations for this paradoxical results either, since any common eﬀort level is a strict Nash equi-

librium and hence a stable equilibrium point for the replicator equations [27, 28]. To explain

2

the behavior found empirically in the MECG, a variety of theoretical approaches have been pro-

posed. Stochastic learning models were investigated to explain the anomalous behavior observed

in the MECG [14, 15]. Anderson [16] extended Rosenthal’s analysis [29, 30] to a MECG with

a continuum of actions and used the logit probabilistic choice framework to determine a unique

“logit equilibrium”. Recently, Iyer and Killingback studied the evolutionary dynamics of these

games through individual-based simulations on complex networks, showing that the evolutionary

behaviors are in good agreement with those observed experimentally [8].

In this work, we study the MECG with mixed strategies [31–33] from the perspective of the

evolutionary balance between selection and mutation. Drawing lessons from coalescence the-

ory [34, 35], we can well resolve the problem which eﬀort levels are more abundant than others

under any mutation rates. In the well-mixed situation, analytic results show that high eﬀort lev-

els can be favored when the eﬀort cost is small, and the opposite is true when the cost is large,

which is in accordance with behavior experiments and does not require extra notion of cognition

or rationality. More importantly, human society is organized in forms of various sets [35, 36], and

the outcome of an evolutionary process in a structured populations (such as games on variety of

networks [37–40], sets [35, 36] or phenotype space [34, 41]) can be very diﬀerent from that in

well-mixed populations. Therefore we utilize evolutionary set theory to investigate the extended

model that individuals only interact with others who are in the same set. It seems that more sets

always enhance eﬀort levels with all other conditions equal. This is ascribed to the fact that group

structure supports the evolution of “within-group helping” [42, 43]. Meanwhile, moderate extent

of random migration between sets eﬀectively boosts mean contribution level [35].

This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes our model and methods, Sec.

III

presents, analyses and discusses the results, and Sec. IV draws conclusions.

II. MODEL AND METHOD

A. Basic model of the MECG

Within this work, the basic model is a minimum-eﬀort coordination game (MECG). Here we

consider the two-person game with a strategy set Φ. Without loss of generality, we set Φ = [0, 1].
We specify an individual i’s strategy as pi ∈ Φ. Let P(p1, p2) be the payoﬀ that strategy p1
gets from strategy p2, P(p1, p2) = min(p1, p2) − κp1. More speciﬁcally, P(p1, p2) is given by the

3

function:

where κ is the cost parameter.

P(p1, p2) =

(1 − κ)p1, if p1 ≤ p2;
if p1 > p2.
p2 − κp1,

B. MECG in well-mixed populations

At ﬁrst we consider the simple but general situation of well-mixed population without any

structure. In the population that consist of N individuals, each one plays the MECG with every

other one and they all get payoﬀs according to the function above. We express the ﬁtness of
player i as an exponential function of the total payoﬀ, i.e., fi = exp(sPi), where s is the intensity
of selection and Pi is i’s total payoﬀ accrued through pairwise interactions with all others once.
In this frequency-dependent Moran process [44], at each time step an individual i is selected for

reproduction proportional to its fi. Reproduction is subject to mutation: The oﬀspring inherits the
strategy of the parent with probability 1 − u and with probability u it adopts a strategy selected

uniformly at random. A strategy p is favored overall in the mutation-selection equilibrium if its

abundance exceeds the mean.

In well-mixed population, we only concentrate on the situation that strategies are continuous.

We use the result in Ref. [31] to derive that, for weak selection (s → 0) and large population size

N, strategy p is favored by selection ifeLp + NueHp > 0, where

{P(p, p) + P(p, q) − P(q, p) − P(q, q)}dq,

eLp = Z 1
0 Z 1
eHp = Z 1

{P(p, r) − P(q, r)}dqdr.

of the unique variable p. Meanwhile, to determine which strategy is most favored by selection,

Here P(·, ·) is deﬁned in Eq. (1) and p, q, r stand for strategy values.eLp and eHp are both functions
one simply has to maximizeeLp + NueHp. Substituting Eq. (1) into Eqs. (2) and (3), we ﬁnd the

condition for strategy p in MECG to be favored by selection to be

eLp + NueHp = −

We can obtain the most common strategy p by maximizingeLp + NueHp in inequality (4).

C. MECG in set structured populations

In this extended model, a population of ﬁnite size N is distributed over M sets and each individ-

ual belongs to one set. The sets could be geographical islands but they could also be phenotypic

traits or tags [45]. Two individuals interact only if they are in the same set (have the same tag).

Successful sets attract more individuals. In addition, in the mutation-selection analysis, besides

strategy mutation u, a set mutation rate v is introduced to represent individuals’ random migration

between sets. The update rule is similar to that in well-mixed population. It is useful to consider

the rescaled mutation rates, µ = Nu and ν = Nv, in the theoretical analysis.

When available strategies in the evolutionary process are discrete and the total number is n, for
simplicity, we utilize the n × n payoﬀ matrix A = [ai j] (i, j = 1, · · · , n) to describe payoﬀs between
any two discrete strategies. Here, ai j = P(pi, p j), where P(·, ·) is deﬁned in Eq. (1). Drawing
lessons from Ref. [45], we acquire that a strategy pm(m = 1, · · · , n) is favored by selection if

λ1(amm − a∗∗) + λ2(am∗ − a∗m) + λ3(am∗ − a) > 0,

(5)

where am∗ =P j am j/n, a∗m =P j a jm/n, a∗∗ =P j a j j/n, and ¯a =PiP j ai j/n2. In addition, drawing

supports from coalescence theory, up to the same positive constant factor,

λ1 ∝ (1 + ν)(3 + µ + ν)(M(2 + µ)(3 + 3µ + 2ν) + ν(4 + 3µ + 2ν)),

λ2 ∝ M(2 + µ)(9 + 3µ(4 + µ) + 6ν + 5µν + ν2)

+ ν(3µ3 + 2(2 + ν)(3 + ν)2 + µ2(21 + 8ν) + µ(49 + ν(38 + 7ν))),

λ3 ∝ µ[M(2 + µ)(9 + 3µ(4 + µ) + 7ν + 5µν + 2ν2)

+ ν(34 + 3µ3 + 40ν + 2ν2(8 + ν) + µ(3 + ν)(16 + 7ν) + µ2(21 + 8ν))].

(6)

(7)

(8)

When strategies are continuous, using the result in Ref. [36] derived by Fu et al., we get that

strategy p is more abundant than the mean frequency if

λ1Z 1

[P(p, q)−P(q, p)]dq+λ3Z 1

Here the λi terms are the same as for the discrete strategies, and P(·, ·), p, q, and r follow the same
deﬁnition as in Eq. (2) and (3).

D.

Individual-based simulations

Individual-based simulations are used for the support of this weak selection analytical calcula-

tions. Meanwhile, with this tool, we can investigate how the average eﬀort evolves across a wide

5

range of selection strengths. In our simulations, individuals interact in a population of constant

size N = 100. Each individual’s strategy is initialized randomly at the beginning of the simulation,
and the strategies of all individuals are recorded over 109 generations.

III. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

A. MECG in well-mixed populations

In the weak selection limit where all individuals have roughly the same reproductive success,

it is possible to analytically derive which strategy is most frequent. In the well-mixed populations

without any structure, by maximizingeLp + NueHp in condition (4), we ﬁnd that the most common

strategy pM follows:

κ ≤ 1

κ > 1

pM = 1
pM = (1−κ)Nu+(1−2κ)
pM = 0
pM = (1−κ)Nu+(1−2κ)

Nu

(if Nu ≤ 1−2κ
κ )
(if Nu > 1−2κ

(if Nu ≤ 2κ−1

(if Nu > 2κ−1
1−κ ).

2 :

As is shown in Fig. 1, the eﬀort cost κ plays the decisive role in determining pM: For small κ
(κ < 1/2), natural selection most favors individuals who are willing to contribute a higher level

(pM > 1/2) ; Whereas large κ (κ > 1/2) leads to the prevalence of low pM (pM < 1/2). pM
monotonically increases with the decreasing of eﬀort cost, according with economic intuition and

patterns in laboratory data [1, 2]. For low mutation rates, at most two strategies are involved in

the population. When κ < 1/2 the fully contribution strategy p = 1 behaves better than any

another strategy, thereby remaining the most abundant; When κ > 1/2, the risk-dominant strategy

p = 0 prevails. Conversely, for high mutation rates, all strategies have almost equal frequencies

throughout evolution, and the strategy contributing p = 1 − κ occupy a position of prominence in

this strategy-coexistence state. Intrudingly, despite the strategy mutation rates, pM sustains at the
level of 0.5 for the critical cost value κ = 0.5, resembling a “ neutral state”.

We next evaluate the impact of selection intensity s on the strategy distributions in the low

mutation case. Suﬃciently small u assures that a single mutant vanishes or ﬁxes in a population

before the next mutant appears, therefore the population is homogeneous most of the time [46].

Thus besides individual-based simulations, embedded Markov chain [47, 48] can be utilized here

to describe the evolutionary dynamics. Simulation results, in good agreement with the analytical

6

results, show that strengthening s does not alter the most common strategy pM, but enhances the
advantage of pM. When κ > 1/2 the average contribution level of the whole population decreases
with the increment of s (see Fig.2 (a), (b)), and the opposite is true for κ < 1/2 (see Fig.2 (c), (d)).

If the imitation strength is considered to be a measure of how precise people’s information is in

learning [49, 50], it seems that information transparency drives the majority of individuals to make

a choice between the “worst” Nash outcome pM = 0 and the “best” equilibrium pM = 1, critically,
relying on whether the eﬀort cost is large.

Drawing support from individual-based simulations, we have further studied how the average

eﬀort evolves across a wide range of selection strengths and mutation rates. Some view points

above have been strengthened in this more general case. As shown in Fig. 3, for small s, all the

average strategies are close to 0.5, their neutral values. As s increases, the average eﬀorts are

determined primarily by cost parameter κ. κ < 1/2 leads to the fact that the mean contributions

are always more than a half and ascends as s rises. On the contrary, κ > 1/2 causes a detrimental

eﬀect to whole populations’ eﬀorts with increasing s. Strategy mutation, introducing randomness

into selection, always inhibits the mean strategy from converging to the extreme states “fully

cooperation”(p = 1) or “complete defection” (p = 0).

B. MECG in set-structured populations

Furthermore, we are interested in how individuals behave in the MECG if they are located

in diﬀerent groups and they do not play with out-group members. Here, Successful sets attract

members, and individuals may adopts a random set with probability v, called migration rate, sim-

ilar to strategy mutation u. This extended model can be investigated using evolutionary set the-

ory [35, 36]. Initially, we concentrate on the simple case of only two strategies p1 and p2, where
p1 > p2. In well-mixed populations, irrespective of any choosing intensity s or mutation rate u,
κ > 1/2 determines that p1 always performs worse than p2. However, “in-group favoritism” may
greatly facilitate p1, if

I , (1 − κ)λ1 − κλ2 + (

− κ)λ3 > 0,

(11)

2

which can be obtained by substituting Eq.

(1) into condition (5) when the total number n of

available strategies is 2 (Correspondingly the size of matrix A is 2 × 2 ). For small strategy

mutation (µ = Nu → 0), I > 0 can be further simpliﬁed as

I1 , (1 − κ)λ1 − κλ2 > 0.

(12)

7

As shown in Fig. 4(a), for large eﬀort cost κ > 1

2 and high migration rate ν = Nv ≫ 1

1−κ , condition

I1 > 0 leads to

M >

(2κ − 1)ν
2(1 − κ)

,

(13)

showing the minimum requirement for M to ensure that p1 prevails over p2. As µ increases, more
sets are required for sustaining p1 at a higher level than p2 (see Fig. 4 (b)-(d)). In this sense,
for large cost parameter κ either elevating µ or ν (when ν is large ) undermine the evolution of

contribution level, but increasing M always boosts eﬀort. This can be attributed to the fact that

more sets enhance the opportunity of the clustering of higher level strategy (p1) to resist against
the invasion from the lower level strategy (p2), even under unfavorable conditions (κ > 1/2).

Moreover, in the weak selection limit, we investigated the MECG with continuous strategy set

Φ = [0, 1]. A global mutation model, in which an oﬀspring mutant adopts a strategy randomly

and uniformly drawn from the unit interval Φ, is utilized to arrive at the analytical results. Using

inequality (9), We deduce that natural selection favors strategy p if and only if

C(p) , −

)λ3 > 0.

(14)

Similarly, the most abundant strategy pM can be obtained by maximizing C(p). Interestingly, for
small strategy mutation µ → 0, the fully contribution behavior (pM = 1) is most favored if I1 > 0
(inequality (12)) holds; Otherwise the majority choose to invest nothing (pM = 0). The optimum
level pM is presented in Fig. 5 across a wide range of µ, ν and M. Obviously, κ also plays the key
role in determining pM (compare Fig. 5(a)-(c) with (d)-(f)). The evolution of pM is prominently
promoted by increasing M, especially for large κ, as shown in Fig. 5(a)-(c). However, low values

of set mutation rate ν, which can be treated as failure in distinguishing sets, keeps individuals from

adopting high eﬀort levels (note the lower parts of Fig. 5(a)-(c)). In addition, moderate ν, equipped

with small µ, is capable of maximizing pM even when κ > 1/2 (see the left parts of Fig. 5(b)(c)).
We are also interested in whether the average strategy frequency hpi of the whole population can

exceed the neutral level for large κ. Drawing supports from Ref. [36], we can conclude that the

condition which ensures hpis→0 > 1/2 is

Z 1

0

pC(p)dp > 0

(15)

which also leads to I > 0 (inequality (11)), coinciding with the two strategies case. The feasible

8

regions of combinations of M and ν, where the whole population incline to contribute a higher

level on average, are also presented in Fig. 4.

Last, under moderate selection intensity, by computer simulations we show the impacts of M

and migration rate ν on average eﬀort respectively. Low κ facilitates eﬀort, in accordance with

above analysis. For κ > 1/2, the average eﬀort ascends sharply with M when M < 100, then

stabilizes at a level slightly above 1/2. As shown in Fig. 6(b), there is an optimal level of ν

promoting the eﬀort level. As mentioned in Ref. [36], without ﬂexibility in group identity (ν → 0)

individuals reside in the same sets forever. On the other hand, excessively high values of ν make

the association between strategy and group membership breaks down.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In the minimum-eﬀort coordination game, any common eﬀort constitutes a Nash equilibrium.

Without further reﬁnement, the Nash equilibrium concept provides little predictive power. How-

ever, experimental data show that eﬀorts are much lower when eﬀort is more costly, or when there

are more players [1–3]. To explain the inconsistency, we bring together ideas from coalescence

theory and evolutionary game dynamics, to investigate how eﬀort levels evolve in a mutation-

selection process.

In the well-mixed situation, analytical results show that eﬀort cost is the primary factor in deter-

mining contribution levels, which is in accordance with experimental data. Meanwhile, changing

imitation intensity can not alter the most common strategy here, diﬀerent from the case in the

TDG [49]. When selection is weak, the dynamics depends greatly on the strategy mutation rate

u. The most common strategy adopted by players converges from the highest contribution level

(when κ < 1/2) or the lowest contribution level (when κ > 1/2) to 1 − κ as u increases.

Furthermore, populations are structured by geography or other factors [35]. Individuals usually

can only interact with those in the same set or group. Therefore evolutionary set theory is utilized

to study evolutionary dynamics of MECG in structured populations. It seems that more sets and

moderate migration rate can eﬀectively promote eﬀort levels, especially when the costs are large.

Since higher eﬀort levels in MECG may be considered to represent more cooperative strategies [8],

our ﬁnding strengthens the viewpoint that the structure of the population allows “cooperative”

strategies to “cluster” in certain sets to resist the invasion of the “defective” ones. This also helps

to explain why optimal coordination level is sometimes achieved even if the cost is very large in

9

human society.

The MECG is of considerable practical importance since many interesting and signiﬁcant real-

world situations can be modeled by such games [6, 8]. We hope our observations could help to

explain how coordination behaviors evolve in a variety of real life situations.

Mutation rate,Nu

FIG. 1: (Color online) The most common strategy as a function of the strategy mutation rate (in terms of

the expected number of mutants per generation, Nu) in the weak selection limit. N is the total population

size and u is the strategy mutation rate. When the eﬀort cost κ is small, “cooperative” strategies are most

common. When κ is large, the opposite is true.

FIG. 6: (Color online) The average eﬀort level as a function of (a) set number M and (b) migration rate v,

obtained by individual-based simulations. Increasing group numbers M enhances “cooperation”,especially

for large κ. However, moderate migration rate promotes average eﬀort level. Parameters: (a) N = 100,

s = 0.01, u = 0.01, v = 0.1, (b) N = 100, s = 0.01, u = 0.01, M = 15. Results are averaged over 109 time
