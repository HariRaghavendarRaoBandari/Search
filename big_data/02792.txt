Appearances of pseudo-bosons from Black-Scholes

equation

F. Bagarello 1

Abstract

It is a well known fact that the Black-Scholes equation admits an alternative representation
as a Schr¨odinger equation expressed in terms of a non self-adjoint hamiltonian. We show
how pseudo-bosons, linear or not, naturally arise in this context, and how they can be
used in the computation of the pricing kernel.

Introduction

Pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics, together with its many relatives, received an increasing
interest by the physicists community and, more recently, by the mathematicians too, because
of its possible applications in concrete systems and also in connection with several interesting
mathematical properties appearing in systems driven by non-hermitian Hamiltonians. We refer
to [1]-[4] for some recent and not so recent reviews or volumes dedicated to this subject.

Most examples of non hermitian Hamiltonians come from physics, see [5]-[8] just to cite a
few, or from mathematics, see [9], where the interest is more focused to a rigorous treatment
of the models under consideration, and to their main constituents.

But, as shown in [10] and, recently, in [11, 12], more examples of this kind of operators
come from an unexpected ﬁeld of research, i.e. from economics. In fact, with a suitable change
of variable, the Black-Scholes equation can be rewritten as a Schr¨odinger equation, but with a
non self-adjoint hamiltonian. This fact was used in [10]-[12] to shown how quantum mechanical
techniques can be useful to compute the pricing kernel for various situations, and how in
some cases the Black-Scholes Hamiltonian can be factorized and used also as an interesting
example in supersymmetric quantum mechanics, [13]. In this paper we show that similar (or
identical) models also provide examples of D-pseudo bosons (D-PBs) and non linear D-PBs
(D-NLPBs), which are excitations recently introduced by us, considering suitable deformations
of the canonical commutation relations (CCRs). We also discuss how pricing kernels can be
deﬁned and computed in these cases.

The paper is organized as follows: in the next section we give a brief mathematical intro-
duction to D-PBs and D-NLPBs, useful to keep the paper self-contained. In Section 3 we show
how D-PBs arise naturally out of the Black-Scholes equation, while in Section 4 we discuss the
appearance of D-NLPBs in the same context. Section 5 contains our conclusions.

2 Mathematical preliminaries

In view of their use in Sections 3 and 4, we devote this section to some preliminary deﬁnitions
and results on D-PBs and D-NLPBs. We refer to [5] and to [14]-[16] for more details.

2.1 Something about D-PBs
Let H be a given Hilbert space with scalar product h., .i and related norm k.k. Let further a
and b be two operators on H, with domains D(a) and D(b) respectively, a† and b† their adjoints,

2

and let D be a dense subspace of H such that a♯D ⊆ D and b♯D ⊆ D, where x♯ is x or x†. We
are not requiring here that D coincides with, e.g. D(a) or with D(b). Nevertheless, for obvious
reasons, D ⊆ D(a♯) and D ⊆ D(b♯).
Deﬁnition 2.1 The operators (a, b) are D-pseudo bosonic (D-pb) if, for all f ∈ D, we have
(2.1)

a b f − b a f = f.

Sometimes, to simplify the notation, instead of (2.1) we will simply write [a, b] = 11, having
in mind that both sides of this equation have to act on vectors of D. Here 11 is the identity
operator on H.

Our working assumptions are the following:

Assumption D-pb 1.– there exists a non-zero ϕ0 ∈ D such that a ϕ0 = 0.
Assumption D-pb 2.– there exists a non-zero Ψ0 ∈ D such that b† Ψ0 = 0.
Then, if (a, b) satisfy Deﬁnition 2.1, it is clear that ϕ0 ∈ D∞(b) := ∩k≥0D(bk) and that

Ψ0 ∈ D∞(a†), so that the vectors

ϕn :=

1
√n!

bnϕ0,

Ψn :=

1
√n!

a†n

Ψ0,

(2.2)

n ≥ 0, can be deﬁned and they all belong to D. Let FΨ = {Ψn, n ≥ 0} and Fϕ = {ϕn, n ≥ 0}.
Since each ϕn and each Ψn belong to D, they also belong to the domains of a♯, b♯, N = ba and
N† = a†b†. In particular, using (2.2) and (2.1) we deduce that

b ϕn = √n + 1 ϕn+1,
a ϕ0 = 0,
a†Ψn = √n + 1 Ψn+1,
b†Ψ0 = 0,

aϕn = √n ϕn−1,
b†Ψn = √n Ψn−1,

n ≥ 0,
n ≥ 1,
n ≥ 0,
n ≥ 1,

(2.3)



as well as the following eigenvalue equations: N ϕn = nϕn and N†Ψn = nΨn, n ≥ 0. Then,
choosing the normalization of ϕ0 and Ψ0 in such a way hϕ0, Ψ0i = 1, we deduce that

hϕn, Ψmi = δn,m,

(2.4)

for all n, m ≥ 0. This can be proved showing ﬁrst that, if n 6= m, ϕn and Ψm are mutually
orthogonal. This follows from the eigenvalues equations above for N and N†. Then, using
induction on n, one can check that hϕn, Ψni = 1, for all n ≥ 0. We refer to [4] and to [18] for

3

more mathematical details on our framework, details which are mostly related to the fact that
the operators involved in the game are almost all unbounded.

Let us now recall that a basis of H is a set of vectors F = {fn ∈ H, n ≥ 0}, such that
each vector g ∈ H can be written as g = Pn cnfn, with the complex coeﬃcients cn uniquely
determined. Here and in the following, convergence is always meant to be unconditional, in the
norm topology of H. Hence, our third assumption is the following:

Assumption D-pb 3.– Fϕ is a basis for H.
This is equivalent to the request that FΨ is a basis for H as well, see for instance [17],
Theorem 3.3.2. In particular, if Fϕ and FΨ are Riesz basis for H, the D-PBs are called regular.
In [18] a weaker version of Assumption D-pb 3 has also been introduced for the ﬁrst time,
particularly interesting for physical applications: let G be a suitable dense subspace of H. Two
biorthogonal sets Fη = {ηn ∈ G, n ≥ 0} and FΦ = {Φn ∈ G, n ≥ 0} are called G-quasi bases if,
for all f, g ∈ G, the following holds:
hf, gi =Xn≥0

hf, ηnihΦn, gi =Xn≥0

hf, Φnihηn, gi .

(2.5)

Is is clear that, while Assumption D-pb 3 implies (2.5), the reverse is false, since this equation
does not necessarily imply, for instance, that g = Pn≥0 hηn, gi Φn. However, if Fη and FΦ
satisfy (2.5), we still have some (weak) form of resolution of the identity1. Now Assumption
D-pb 3 may be replaced by the following weaker condition:

Assumption D-pbw 3.– Fϕ and FΨ are G-quasi bases for some subspace G dense in H.
Let now Assumptions D-pb 1, D-pb 2, and D-pbw 3 be satisﬁed. It might happen that
G = D, but these sets can in general be diﬀerent. Let us consider a self-adjoint, invertible,
operator Θ, which leaves, together with Θ−1, D invariant: ΘD ⊆ D, Θ−1D ⊆ D. Then, [18], we
say that (a, b†) are Θ−conjugate if af = Θ−1b† Θ f , for all f ∈ D. We can show that (a, b†) are
Θ−conjugate if and only if (b, a†) are Θ−conjugate. Moreover, one can prove that (a, b†) are
Θ−conjugate if and only if Ψn = Θϕn, for all n ≥ 0. Furthermore, if (a, b†) are Θ−conjugate,
then it turns out, [5], that (i) hf, Θfi > 0 for all non zero f ∈ D, and that (ii) ΘN f = N†Θf ,
for all f ∈ D. This last equality, which we can write as ΘN = N†Θ, is an intertwining relation,
which is quite interesting in physics, see [19], for instance.

1We recall that two biorthogonal sets Ff = {fn ∈ H, n ≥ 0} and Fg = {gn ∈ H, n ≥ 0} produce a resolution
of the identity in H if, for all f, g ∈ H, we get hf, gi =Pn≥0 hf, fnihgn, gi =Pn≥0 hf, gnihfn, gi. It is important
to stress that, in (2.5), f and g are assumed to belong to a dense subset of H, and this is motivated by many
physical models, [5].

2.2 Something about D-NLPBs
D-PBs have been proved to be quite useful to factorize and to ﬁnd eigenvalues and eigenstates
of several non self-adjoint Hamiltonians introduced along the years in the literature by many
authors, Hamiltonians whose eigenvalues are linear in the quantum numbers of the system, see
[5] for a (partial) list of applications. On the other hand, when this dependence is not linear,
D-PBs do not work well. For this reason, we have introduced a slightly extended deﬁnition of
D-PBs, which seems to provide a natural settings for these diﬀerent situations: let us consider
a strictly increasing sequence {ǫn}: 0 = ǫ0 < ǫ1 < · · · < ǫn < · · · . Then, given two operators a
and b on H, and a set D ⊂ H which is dense in H, and which is stable under the action of a♯
and b♯, we introduce the following:

Deﬁnition 2.2 We will say that the triple (a, b,{ǫn}) is a family of D-non linear pseudo-bosons
(D-NLPBs) if the following properties hold:

• p1. a non zero vector Φ0 exists in D such that a Φ0 = 0;
• p2. a non zero vector η0 exists in D such that b† η0 = 0;
• p3. Calling

Φn :=

bn Φ0,

ηn :=

1
√ǫn!

1
√ǫn!

a†n

η0,

we have, for all n ≥ 0,

a Φn = √ǫn Φn−1,

b†ηn = √ǫn ηn−1.

(2.6)

(2.7)

• p4. The set FΦ = {Φn, n ≥ 0} is a basis for H.
Notice that, since D is stable under the action of b and a†, both Φn and ηn belong to D,
for all n ≥ 0. However, it might happen, and in fact it happens in Section 4, that Φn and
ηn belong to D by themselves, i.e. without any need to check if D is stable or not under the
action of a♯ and b♯. This is important to have in mind, especially when this check is particularly
complicated, as it happens in Section 4. Incidentally, notice also that D-PBs can be treated as
a particular case of Deﬁnition 2.2, simply taking ǫn = n.

As shown in [14], the set Fη = {ηn, n ≥ 0} is automatically a basis for H as well, and,
calling M = ba, we deduce that MΦn = ǫnΦn and M†ηn = ǫnηn. Therefore, choosing the
normalization of η0 and Φ0 in such a way hη0, Φ0i = 1, Fη is biorthogonal to the basis FΦ. This
mean that Fη is the unique basis which is biorthogonal to FΦ.

5

As for D-PBs, it could be reasonable to replace p4. with some weaker requirement. In

particular, it is natural to assume that

• pw4. FΦ and Fη are G-quasi bases for some G ⊂ H, dense in H.
Also in this context it is possible to deduce interesting intertwining relations. For instance, if
a self-adjoint, invertible and, in general, unbounded operator Θ exists which, together with Θ−1,

leaves D invariant, and such that ηn = Θ Φn, ∀ n, see Section 2.1, then (cid:0)M†Θ − ΘM(cid:1) Φn = 0,
and (cid:0)Θ−1M† − MΘ−1(cid:1) ηn = 0, for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
3 D-PBs from the Black-Scholes equation
After this brief mathematical introduction on D-PBs and D-NLPBs, we want to show how this
general formalism appears in a rather natural way out of the Black-Scholes equation for option
pricing with constant volatility σ,

Here C(S, t) is the price of the option, S is the stock price and r is the risk-free spot interest
Introducing a new variable x via S = ex, and the related unknown function Ψ(x) as
rate.
C(S(x), t) = eǫtΨ(x), equation (3.1) can be rewritten in the following form:

HBSΨ(x) = ǫΨ(x),

where

HBS = −

(3.2)

Notice that, even if (3.2) looks like a Schr¨odinger equation, its Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint,
dx , which is linear in the x-derivative.

HBS 6= H†BS, because of the presence of the term(cid:16) σ2

However, deﬁning the multiplication operator by

which holds for all f (x) ∈ D(R), the set of the C∞ functions with compact support. The reason
for taking f (x) in D(R) is because, on D(R), ρ and ρ−1 are surely well deﬁned. More than this:
D(R) is stable under the action of ρ± 1. In other words, D(R) ⊆ D(ρ) ∩ D(ρ−1). However, it is
clear that neither ρ nor ρ−1 are deﬁned on all of L2(R): they are both unbounded operators.

For future convenience, rather than working on D(R), it is convenient to consider the set

D = {f (x) ∈ S(R) : eγxf (x) ∈ S(R), ∀γ ∈ C},

which contains D(R) as a subset, and for this reason is dense in L2(R). Here S(R) is the set
of all the C∞ functions which decay to zero, together with their derivatives, faster than any
negative power. Equation (3.4) also holds if f (x) ∈ D. For brevity we will write

hBS = −

(3.5)

Notice that hBS = h†BS, since it is proportional to the square of the momentum operator
ˆp := −i d
dx , plus a real constant2. In particular, hBS describes nothing but a free particle, of
mass σ−2, subjected to a constant potential. As for the Black-Scholes Hamiltonian HBS, we
ﬁnd that

(3.6)
for all f (x) ∈ D. As before, to simplify the notation, we will simply write H†BS = ρ2HBSρ−2:
ρ2 intertwines between HBS and H†BS.

H†BSf (x) =(cid:0)ρ2HBSρ−2(cid:1) f (x),

In [10, 11, 12] some real potential V (x) is added to the operator HBS, deﬁning in this way
a new operator, Hef f = HBS + V (x). The economical interpretation of V (x), see [10], is that it
can be used to represent a certain class of options; we will not insist on that here. Of course,
Hef f is also not self-adjoint, but can be easily mapped into a (formally) self-adjoint operator
hef f = h†ef f extending what we have done above:

hef f := ρHef f ρ−1 = hBS + V (x),

and H†ef f = ρ2Hef f ρ−2.

(3.7)

These equalities could be made rigorous acting on functions of D. In [12] the authors’ interest
was focused on the factorization of Hef f , using standard results in supersymmetric quantum
mechanics, [13]. Hef f can indeed be written as

+ W (x) − β11(cid:19) , B =

σ

√2(cid:18)−

d
dx

+ W (x) + β11(cid:19) ,

2We are adopting here the quantum mechanical notation, calling ˆp the momentum operator. It is well known,

(3.8)

(3.9)

where δ = σ2β2

2 + r, A and B are operators deﬁned as follows

Hef f = BA + δ11,

A =

and where the real function W (x) is related to the potential V (x) as follows:

σ2

V (x) =

2 (cid:2)W 2(x) − W ′(x)(cid:3) .

(3.10)

With these deﬁnitions, in [12] was also shown that B = ρ−2A†ρ2. Hence B = A† if ρ = 11,
which is true only if β = 0, see (3.3). This is clearly in agreement with the explicit expressions
for A and B in (3.9). Incidentally, in the language of Section 2.1, equality B = ρ−2A†ρ2 means
that (B, A†) are ρ2-conjugate.

3.1 How D-PBs appear
So far we are close to [12]. Now, we focus on a diﬀerent aspect of Hef f . In fact, rather than
considering its supersymmetric partner, we look for the spectra of Hef f and H†ef f and for their
eigenstates. For this reason, what is important for us, at least as a ﬁrst step, is the commutator
between A and B in (3.9). A natural choice consists in requiring that [A, B] = 11, the identity
operator. This ﬁxes the analytic form of W (x), and of V (x) as a consequence. In fact, since
for all f (x) ∈ D we have [A, B]f (x) = σ2W ′(x)f (x), it is clear that [A, B] = 11 if

W (x) =

x
σ2 + w,

(3.11)

where w is an arbitrary constant3, which we take real to ensure reality of W (x) and, conse-
quently, of V (x). In fact, using (3.10), we ﬁnd that

V (x) =

σ2

2 (cid:16) x

σ2 + w(cid:17)2

−

(3.12)

This is a quadratic, real-valued, potential. Therefore, with this choice, Hef f becomes a non self-
adjoint shifted harmonic oscillator which appears, in slightly diﬀerent ways, in several models
in pseudo-hermitian quantum mechanics. We refer to [5], and references therein, and to [21],
for some examples of similar systems. Fixing W (x) as in (3.11) the operators A and B look
like

A =

(3.14)

Recalling that hef f = ρHef f ρ−1, and that Hef f = BA + δ, it is natural to introduce a new
operator,

again to be understood as an equality on D. If we now compute ρBρ−1f (x), f (x) ∈ D, we
deduce that

c = ρAρ−1 =

It is now possible to check that hef f can be written in terms of these operators as

hef f = c†c + δ,

and that [c, c†] = 11. Then, calling Φ0(x) the vacuum of c, c Φ0 = 0, we ﬁnd that, with a suitable
choice of the normalization,

Φ0(x) =

π1/4√σ

(3.15)

Notice that kΦ0k = 1 and that Φ0(x) ∈ S(R) but also, more interesting for us, Φ0(x) ∈ D.
This function is an eigenstate of hef f , with eigenvalue E0 = δ. The other eigenstates of hef f
can be constructed out of Φ0(x) acting on this with powers of c†. We ﬁnd:

c†n

Φ0(x) =

Φn(x) =

pσ 2n n!√π
for n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Here Hn(x) is the n−th Hermite polynomial. The set FΦ = {Φn(x), n ≥ 0}
is an orthonormal basis for L2(R), and we have
hef f Φn(x) = EnΦn(x),

where En = n + δ

,

n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . ..

What we want to do now is to work directly with A and B, and with Hef f as in (3.8), rather
than with c and its adjoint. The reason is that, as we have seen in several applications along
the years, even if Hef f is similar to hef f , this does not imply that the properties of hef f and
of its eigenstates automatically hold also for Hef f and for its eigenvectors. In fact, the map
which implements the similarity between these two operators is unbounded, and therefore not
everywhere deﬁned. This may have bad consequences, and in fact this is what we are now going
to show.

9

Let A and B be the operators in (3.13). As we have seen, [A, B]f (x) = f (x), for all
f (x) ∈ D. D is stable under the action of A, B, and their adjoint. The solutions of Aϕ0 = 0
and B†Ψ0 = 0 satisfying hϕ0, Ψ0i = 1 can be easily found:

ϕ0(x) = Nϕ e−(cid:16) x2

2σ2 +(w−β)x(cid:17), Ψ0(x) = NΨ e−(cid:16) x2

2σ2 +(w+β)x(cid:17),

with Nϕ NΨ = 1

π1/4√σ eσ2w2. Now, choosing Nϕ = NΨ real, we ﬁnd that

( ϕ0(x) = eβxΦ0(x) = ρ−1 Φ0(x),

Ψ0(x) = e−βxΦ0(x) = ρ Φ0(x).

(3.18)

It is clear that neither ϕ0(x) nor Ψ0(x) belong to D(R), while they both belong to D. This
explains why D is more relevant for us than the sets D(R). D is also more useful than S(R),
because, even if ϕ0(x), Ψ0(x) ∈ S(R), S(R) is not stable under the action of ρ± 1, which is
something useful for us. Incidently, we also observe that each Φn(x) in (3.16) belongs to S(R)
and to D, but not to D(R).

By induction we can now check that (3.18) extends to all the other functions, i.e. that,

deﬁning ϕn(x) and Ψn(x) as in (2.2), then

( ϕn(x) = ρ−1 Φn(x),

Ψn(x) = ρ Φn(x),

(3.19)

for n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Here Φn(x) are given in (3.16). Of course, each ϕn(x) and each Ψn(x) belong
to D. It might be interesting to observe that Ψn(x) can be deduced directly from ϕn(x) simply
replacing β with −β. Now, let us consider the sets FΨ = {Ψn, n ≥ 0} and Fϕ = {ϕn, n ≥ 0}.
These are two biorthogonal sets of eigenvectors of N = BA and N† = A†B†:

N ϕn(x) = nϕn(x), N†Ψn(x) = nΨn(x),

hϕn, Ψmi = δn,m.

if σ2 = 2r), then ϕn(x) = Ψn(x) = Φn(x) for
Our previous results show that, if β = 0 (i.e.
all n. Hence the sets Fϕ and FΨ both coincide with FΦ, which is an orthonormal basis for
H = L2(R). Hence a natural question is whether Fϕ and FΨ are also bases if β 6= 0. To prove
that, in this case, they are indeed not bases, we will compute ﬁrst kϕnk and kΨnk. This can
be done using Formula 7.374.7 of [22]:

e−(x−y)2

ZR

Hm(x)Hn(x)dx = 2n√π m! yn−mLn−m

m (−2y2),

if m ≤ n. Here Lk

m is a Laguerre polynomial. Hence,

kϕnk2 = eβ2σ2−2βwσ2

Ln(−2β2σ2),

kΨnk2 = eβ2σ2+2βwσ2

Ln(−2β2σ2),

10

which are both diverging if n → ∞, when β 6= 0, see [23], Theorem 8.22.3. We can now use
[24], Lemma 3.3.3, to prove that Fϕ and FΨ are indeed not bases:
let us assume for a moment that Fϕ is a basis for H. Hence each f ∈ H can be written
as f = P∞n=0 hΨn, fi ϕn = P∞n=0 Pn(f ), where Pn(f ) := hΨn, fi ϕn. However, since kPnk =
kϕnkkΨnk, and since kPnk = kϕnkkΨnk → ∞, supn kPnk = ∞. As a consequence, the above
expansion cannot converge for all vectors f ∈ H. Hence, Fϕ cannot be a basis for H. In a
similar way we can conclude that FΨ cannot be a basis for H. On the other hand, since when
β = 0 the argument of the Laguerre functions Ln is zero, and since Ln(0) = 1 for all n, we
deduce that kϕnk = kΨnk = 1. Hence supn kPnk = 1, and the argument above does not apply.
This is in agreement with what we have seen before: if β = 0, Fϕ and FΨ coincide and they
give rise to a (single) orthonormal basis of H.

Going back to the case β 6= 0, it is still possible to show that Fϕ and FΨ are D-quasi bases.
For that, it is suﬃcient to recall that D is stable under the action of ρ and ρ−1. Hence, taken
f, g ∈ D, we have

hf, gi =(cid:10)ρf, ρ−1g(cid:11) =

∞

Xn=0

hρf, Φni(cid:10)Φn, ρ−1g(cid:11) =

∞

Xn=0

hf, ϕni hΨn, gi ,

and analogously hf, gi =P∞n=0 hf, Ψnihϕn, gi. In the derivation we have used the fact that FΦ
is an orthonormal basis for H.

Other results which can be easily deduced are the following:

1. (A, B†) are Θ-conjugate, where Θ := ρ2 = e−2βx. This can be checked computing explic-

itly Af and Θ−1B†Θf , for f ∈ D, and noticing that they coincide.

2. Ψn(x) = Θϕn(x), for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . ..

3. Θ is a positive operator.

Then the general framework discussed in Section 2.1 is recovered in all its aspects. Of

course, we also have

Hef f ϕn = Enϕn,

H†ef f Ψn = EnΨn,

(3.20)

for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . .: Hef f and H†ef f are isospectral, as expected, and they are also isospectral
to hef f , see (3.17). In fact, the following intertwining relations can be easily deduced:

ρHef f = hef f ρ, H†ef f ρ = ρhef f ,

and ΘHef f = H†ef f Θ,

the position operator written, in agreement with [10, 11, 12], as a Dirac bra.

In the present context, due to the existence of two equally relevant Hamiltonians, Hef f and

H†ef f , we have two possible choices for the price kernel:

p2(x, x′; τ ) =Dx, e−τ H †
Assuming that Fϕ and FΨ produce a resolution of the identity4, we have

This is in agreement with the fact that p1(x, x′; 0) = δ(x − x′), see [10, 11, 12].

(2) Concerning p2(x, x′; τ ), not many diﬀerences arise. The only point is that, when using
the resolution of the identity in its deﬁnition (assuming again that this holds true) we have to

4This is not granted by the fact that Fϕ and FΨ are D-quasi bases, since neither |xi nor e−τ H |x′i belong

identity.

ϕn is not!):

Similar computations show that the result diﬀers from p1(x, x′; τ ) just for β being replaced by

4 D-NLPBs from the Black-Scholes equation

In this section, more on the lines of [10] and [11], we consider a diﬀerent choice of V (x) in Hef f ,
and we show how the general structure sketched in Section 2.2 is recovered in this case.

The potential V (x) we consider here is no longer the one in (3.10). V (x) is now a double

knock out barrier deﬁned as

V (x) =( 0

if x ∈]a, b[
otherwise.

As before we have hef f = ρHef f ρ−1 = hBS + V (x), see (3.7), where hBS is given in (3.5), which
we rewrite here as

From a mathematical point of view the situation is, in a sense, slightly simpler than the
one in the previous section, since the Hilbert space of this model is H1 = L2(a, b), and both
ρ and ρ−1 turn out to be bounded operators on H1. Then, deﬁning ϕn(x) = ρ−1 Φn(x) and
Ψn(x) = ρ Φn(x) as in (3.19), they are automatically well deﬁned in H1, and biorthogonal:
hϕn, Ψmi1 = δn,m, where h., .i1 is the scalar product in L2(a, b). Moreover,
H†ef f Ψn(x) = ˜ǫn Ψn(x),

Hef f ϕn(x) = ˜ǫn ϕn(x),

(4.3)

n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Now, since ρ±1 are bounded, and since FΦ = {Φn(x), n ≥ 0} is an orthonormal
basis for H1, Fϕ = {ϕn(x), n ≥ 0} and FΨ = {Ψn(x), n ≥ 0} are Riesz bases for H1.

13

In [11] Hef f is shown to be (essentially) factorizable. In fact, introducing

A =

we have

d

for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. We see that A 6= B† if β 6= 0, which is in agreement with our previous
analysis of Hef f .

4.1 This factorization does not work

We extend (4.5) to the linear span of the ϕn’s, which, being Fϕ a Riesz basis, is dense in H1.
Brieﬂy we write

Hef f =

BA + δ,

δ = γ +

Also, H†ef f = σ2
2 A†B† + δ. In the attempt to use in the present context the general settings
discussed in Section 2.2, we have ﬁrst to control if Aϕ0 = 0 and B†Ψ0 = 0. With our deﬁnitions
these are both true, as one can explicitly check. Hence p1 and p2 are satisﬁed. However, it
is also easy to see that p3 is not satisﬁed, since, in particular, Bϕn is not proportional to
In fact, while Bϕ0(x) is proportional to eβx cos(λ1(x − a)), ϕ1(x) is proportional to
ϕn+1.
eβx sin(2λ1(x − a)): hence Bϕ0(x) and ϕ1(x) are diﬀerent.

The conclusion is therefore that the operators A and B in (4.4), even if they are useful to
factorize Hef f , cannot give rise to a family of D-NLPBs as deﬁned in Section 2.2. However,
this does not exclude that diﬀerent factorizations do exist which make this possible, and in fact
this is what we are going to show next.

4.2 A diﬀerent factorization

We start our analysis noticing that, if Hef f has to be factorized in terms of a diﬀerent pair of
operators ˆA and ˆB, the following equality should be true:

so that

(cid:20) σ2

ˆB ˆA + δ(cid:21) ϕn(x) = ˜ǫnϕn(x),

ˆB ˆAϕn(x) = ρnϕn(x),

(4.7)

where ρn = λ2

.

In our next construction, we will make use of the fact that Fϕ and FΨ are biorthogonal
Riesz bases for H1, and we will adopt here the general framework originally proposed, in a
rather abstract version, in [9]. This is natural, since the main mathematical tool used in [9] is
exactly a pair of biorthogonal Riesz bases, as the one we have here.

We ﬁrst introduce the operators ˆB and ˆA as follows:

∞

D( ˆB) =(f ∈ H1 :
Xn=0
D( ˆA) =(f ∈ H1 :
Xn=1

∞

√ρn+1 hΨn, fi1 ϕn+1 exists in H1) ,
√ρn hΨn, fi1 ϕn−1 exists in H1) ,

and

ˆBf =

Xn=0

√ρn+1 hΨn, fi1 ϕn+1,

ˆAg =

√ρn hΨn, gi1 ϕn−1,

(4.8)

∞

Xn=1

for all f ∈ D( ˆB) and g ∈ D( ˆA). These two operators are densely deﬁned since, calling Lϕ the
linear span of the ϕn’s, which is dense in H1, we have Lϕ ⊆ D( ˆB) and Lϕ ⊆ D( ˆA). Following
[9] we can rewrite these domains as

D( ˆB) =(f ∈ H1 :

∞

Xn=0

ρn+1 | hΨn, fi1 |2 < ∞) , D( ˆA) =(g ∈ H1 :

ρn | hΨn, gi1 |2 < ∞) .

∞

Xn=0

Moreover, see [9], we also have

ˆB ˆAf =

∞

Xn=0

ρn hΨn, fi1 ϕn,

ˆA ˆBg =

Xn=0

ρn+1 hΨn, gi1 ϕn,

n | hΨn, fi1 |2 < ∞) , D( ˆA ˆB) =(g ∈ H1 :

where f ∈ D( ˆB ˆA) and g ∈ D( ˆA ˆB), with
D( ˆB ˆA) =(f ∈ H1 :
n+1 | hΨn, gi1 |2 < ∞) .
Both D( ˆB ˆA) and D( ˆA ˆB) are dense in H1, since Lϕ is contained in both these sets. A direct
computation now shows that, as expected, ϕn ∈ D( ˆB ˆA) and ˆB ˆAϕn = ρnϕn, ∀ n, see (4.7), and
ˆA ˆBϕn = ρn+1ϕn, ∀ n.
Our next goal is to show that(cid:16) ˆA, ˆB,{ρn}(cid:17) is a family of ˆD-NLPBs, for ˆD deﬁned as follows:

Xn=0

ρ2

∞

ˆD =(cid:8)f (x) ∈ L2(a, b) : f′(x) ∈ L2(a, b)(cid:9) .

15

ei 2πkx

b−a , k ∈ Z, which is dense in H1.

This set is dense in L2(a, b), since it contains the linear span of the functions hk(x) :=
1√b−a
In fact, {hk(x), k ∈ Z} is an orthonormal basis
for H1.
The functions ϕ0(x) =q 2
b−a e−βx sin(λ1(x−a)) belong
to ˆD, and they satisfy the equation ˆAϕ0 = 0. Moreover, since ˆB† = P∞n=0 √ρn+1 Ψn ⊗ ϕn+1,
we have also ˆB†Ψ0 = 0. Here, given f, g, h ∈ H1, we have deﬁned (h ⊗ g)f := hg, fi h. Hence,
Assumptions p1. and p2. are both satisﬁed. Also, we can check that ˆA† = P∞n=1 √ρn Ψn ⊗

ϕn−1, and a direct computation shows that also Assumption p3.
is satisﬁed. Finally, p4.
follows from our working assumption, in its stronger version (recall that Fϕ and FΨ are Riesz
bases). We also have

b−a eβx sin(λ1(x−a)) and Ψ0(x) =q 2

ˆA† ˆB† Ψn = ρn Ψn,

(4.10)

as well as ˆB† ˆA† Ψn = ρn+1 Ψn.

Remark:– It should be observed that the stability of ˆD under the action of ˆA♯ and ˆB♯ is not
evident. Therefore, the framework in Section 2.2 is not completely recovered. However, what
we have discussed here shows that this stability is not really needed if we are just interested
to obtain biorthogonal bases of two non self-adjoint operators, at least if we have (as we do
have here) some reason which guarantees that all the vectors ϕn and Ψn belong to a same set,
dense in the Hilbert space of the system. In other words, we can say that the Hamiltonian Hef f
considered in this section produces a slightly modiﬁed version of D-NLPBs, sharing with those
introduced in Section 2.2 most of their properties.
We continue our analysis introducing the operators Sϕ =P∞n=0 ϕn⊗ϕn and SΨ =P∞n=0 Ψn⊗
Ψn, which are well deﬁned everywhere in H1 since they can be written respectively as

Sϕ = ρ−2 = e2βx,

SΨ = ρ2 = e−2βx.

(4.11)

We see that they are self-adjoint, positive, and one the inverse of the other. Moreover, they are
bounded and the following intertwining relations can explicitly be checked:

Sϕ( ˆB ˆA)†Ψn = ( ˆB ˆA)SϕΨn, SΨ( ˆB ˆA)ϕn = ( ˆB ˆA)†SΨϕn,

for all n ≥ 0. Similar intertwining relations can be found for the operator ˆA ˆB.

We end this section with the computation of the price kernels we have introduced in the

previous section. In particular, repeating similar computations, here we ﬁnd

p1(x, x′; τ ) =(cid:10)x, e−τ Hef f x′(cid:11) =

sin [(n + 1)λ1(x − a)] sin [(n + 1)λ1(x′ − a)]

and k2 = σ2π2

can be rewritten in closed form in terms of the Θ-function Θ3(u, q), see [22], Formula 8.180.4,

The pricing kernel could then be used, together with a suitable pay function g(x′), to recover

the price of the options as in

Cj(x; τ ) =ZR

pj(x, x′; τ )g(x′),

j = 1, 2. We notice that, in the present settings we have, of course, two diﬀerent prices C1
and C2, related one to the other simply by replacing β with −β. In particular, they collapses
when β = 0, i.e. when σ2 = 2r. More on the economical aspects of the model can be deduced
following what is done in [10]. We will not consider these aspects here, since in this paper this
is not our main interest.

5 Conclusions

We have discussed how to use the Black-Scholes equation for option pricing with constant
volatility to produce examples of D-PBs and D-NLPBs. In particular we have found an example
in which the eigenstates of the non self-adjoint Hamiltonians associated to the Black-Scholes
equation form D-quasi bases but not bases, and another example in which they form Riesz
bases. We have also deduced, for both these examples, the price kernels in closed forms.

17

As it is clear from our treatment, we have considered here mainly the mathematical aspects
of the Schr¨odinger-like version of the Black-Scholes equation with just few comments on its
economical meaning, and on the consequences of our approach. This is exactly what we hope
to do next.
