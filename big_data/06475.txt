Abstract

We derive a new form of a thermodynamically consistent quasi-incompressible

diﬀuse-interface Navier–Stokes Cahn–Hilliard model for a two-phase-ﬂow of in-

compressible ﬂuids with diﬀerent densities. The derivation is based on mixture

theory by invoking the second law of thermodynamics and Coleman-Noll pro-

cedure.

In addition, we develop a linear and unconditionally energy stable

time-integration scheme for the derived model. Such a scheme is nontrivial,

because it has to suitably deal with all nonlinear terms in the model. Our

proposed scheme is the ﬁrst linear method satisfying a discrete energy law for

quasi-incompressible two-phase ﬂows. The scheme also preserves mass. Numer-

ical experiments verify the suitability of the scheme for high density ratios and

for large time step sizes by considering the coalescence and break-up dynamics

of droplets including pinching due to gravity.

1. Introduction

Diﬀuse-interface (phase-ﬁeld) models have emerged as a reliable and ver-

satile alternative to sharp-interface methods for multi-phase ﬂows. The main

idea of diﬀuse-interface models is to replace the sharp interface by a thin, but

ﬁnite transition region where a partial mixing of macroscopically immiscible

ﬂuids is allowed and to deﬁne a conserved and continuous order parameter (or

phase variable) using mass or volume concentration. This leads to the main

advantage of diﬀuse-interface models which is the natural capability of captur-

ing topological changes e.g., break-up and coalescence. Another fundamental

feature of diﬀuse-interface models is their rigorous thermodynamic basis. Most

of the models satisfy a nonlinear stability relationship such as dissipation of

a non-convex free-energy functional, which endows these models with a strong

mathematical foundation. Over the years, diﬀuse interface models have been

analyzed theoretically [12, 13] and have been used widely in many applications

[5, 8, 30, 34, 38]. Reviews of phase-ﬁeld models in the context of ﬂuid mechanics

are presented in [4, 19, 28].

In this work, we describe a new derivation of a Navier–Stokes equation cou-

pled with a convective Cahn–Hilliard equation, which is a diﬀuse interface ﬂuid

ﬂow model for two incompressible, viscous Newtonian ﬂuids. The Cahn–Hilliard

equation is a fundamental continuum model for phase separation individually,

which was ﬁrst introduced in [9]. Since it is a fourth order nonlinear parabolic

PDE, it is challenging to solve it numerically. Coupling it with the Navier-Stokes

equation increases the mathematical complexity of the model and that makes it

diﬃcult to design provably stable numerical schemes. For that reason, we will

also introduce a linear and stable time-integration scheme for the derived model.

The scheme preserves the structural properties of the model such as mass con-

servation and energy dissipation at the semi-discrete level, independent of time

step size.

To explain the idea behind our derivation, we give a short overview of the

existing Navier–Stokes Cahn–Hilliard (NSCH) models. The initial ideas behind

2

NSCH-type models for immiscible binary ﬂuids go back to classical works of van

der Waals [39] and Korteweg [31], but one of the ﬁrst appearances of the coupled

NSCH model, called ‘Model H’, can be found in the review by Hohenberg and

Halperin [26]. It assumes a solenoidal mixture velocity ﬁeld (divv = 0) and the

coupling takes place via a convective term in the Cahn–Hilliard equation and an

additional stress tensor in the Navier–Stokes equation. Importantly, the model

assumes that the individual densities and the mixture density are constant.

However, that assumption makes Model H inapplicable for the large variety of

problems with non-matching component densities. A derivation of Model H in

the rational continuum mechanics framework was presented by Gurtin et al.

[24], who also established compatibility with the second law of thermodynam-

ics. For non-matching component densities, Guermond and Quartapelle [20]

assumed a variable mixture density ρ for ﬂuid ﬂows, but not in the framework

of multiple phases. Then, alternative variations to Model H were developed

in [7, 11, 36] using the idea of Guermond and Quartapelle. Nevertheless, the

energy-dissipation relation does not hold for these models, i.e. the variations of

Model H are thermodynamically inconsistent.

Lowengrub and Truskinovsky [32] and Abels et al.

[2] extended Model H

to a thermodynamically consistent model for non-matching densities using two

diﬀerent modelling assumptions on the velocity ﬁeld (mass averaged or volume

averaged velocity) and on the phase-ﬁeld variable (mass concentration or volume

fraction). Although the models by Lowengrub and Truskinovsky [32] and Abels

et al. [2] are developed to represent the same type of ﬂow dynamics, the resulting

equations have signiﬁcant diﬀerences due to the underlying modeling choices.

More explicitly, by adopting a mass-averaged velocity, the model by Lowengrub
and Truskinovsky leads to a (generally) non-solenoidal velocity ﬁeld (divv (cid:54)= 0)
and additional nonlinear terms compared to Model H, whereas the model of

Abels et al. leads to a solenoidal (divergence-free) velocity ﬁeld and a modiﬁed

mass conservation equation on account of a volume-averaged mixture velocity

modeling assumption. Noteworthy is also the recent work by Aki et al.

[3],

deriving a Navier–Stokes–Korteweg/Cahn–Hilliard/Allen–Cahn model using a

3

volume fraction phase variable and mass averaged velocity. This model has

nonsolenoidal velocity and an additional Korteweg stress tensor which does not

exist in the other models.

The ﬁrst objective of this paper is to derive the following new NSCH model:

and to prove its thermodynamic consistency. Here, φ is the volume fraction

as phase variable, v is the mass-averaged mixture velocity, µ is chemical po-

tential and p is pressure. Moreover, ρ1 and ρ2 are the component densities, σ

is a constant related to the ﬂuid-ﬂuid surface tension, ε is the ﬁnite interface

thickness, η(φ) is the mixture viscosity, m(φ) is the mobility coeﬃcient and α
is a constant deﬁned in terms of ρ1 and ρ2. In the model, the term ˆρgˆj stands

for gravitational force and D is the symmetric velocity gradient tensor. Such

a model is diﬀerent than the one by Aki et al. as it does not have a Korteweg

tensor in the momentum equation. We also introduce an alternative system to

(1) throughout the same modeling assumptions (see Remark 9 below). In the

system, we have two distinct but equivalent mixture densities: ρ and ˆρ, where ρ

is the usual density deﬁned by mass conservation equation and ˆρ is an algebraic

constitutive equation deﬁned in terms of the species densities, ρ1 and ρ2, and

the volume fraction φ. Note that ˆρ appears in the system (1) in combination

with the pressure p and the gravitational force g. The coupling between the

Navier–Stokes and the Cahn–Hilliard part is strong, not only due to the convec-

tive term in Cahn–Hilliard and the capillary force in Navier–Stokes equations,

but also because of the pressure p appearing in the chemical potential and in the

momentum equation in combination with the gradient of the volume fraction φ.

4

It should be noted that in the case of matching densities, all models for

variable density phase ﬂows which are mentioned above including our model

reduce to Model H. For the mathematical theory of existence of weak solutions

of general NSCH equations, we refer to Abels [1].

Solving the NSCH system numerically and obtaining stable results are chal-

lenging due to the strong coupling, high order derivatives, the nonlinear terms

in the model and the multiscale character of the equations in space and time.

Time-integration schemes which dissipate free energy at the discrete level are

referred to as energy-stable schemes. Having an unconditionally energy stable

time-scheme for NSCH equations is crucial for the proper resolution of the in-

terface, as this allows, in principle, for arbitrary time and space discretization

and thus adaptivity. Adaptivity is essential to obtain eﬃcient approximations

for diﬀuse-interface type problems, for which error estimation ideas are pre-

sented in [37]. Existing schemes for the Cahn–Hilliard equation separately give

inspiration to overcome the nonlinearity in the coupled model. They are semi-

implicit (continuous in space, discrete in time) ﬁrst and second order energy

stable time schemes, some of which are presented in [18, 27, 40, 41]. Energy

stable ﬁrst and second-order accurate time schemes for NSCH equations with

solenoidal velocity ﬁeld are also investigated in [11, 16, 25, 29, 33, 36]. However,

the mass-averaged mixture velocity assumption as in the model by Lowengrub

et al. gives rise to another challenge , viz. a non-solenoidal velocity ﬁeld and an

additional pressure term in the chemical potential. A corresponding nonlinear

time-integration scheme has been presented in [21].

The second objective of this work is to propose a simple linear energy-stable

time-integration scheme for model (1). The proposed scheme is energy-stable,

independent of the time step size, as long as the mixture density remains pos-

itive. Moreover, under standard assumptions on the boundary conditions, the

scheme is mass conservative . By virtue of the fact that our method exhibits

these favorable properties independent of the ratio of the component densi-

ties, it provides a robust model for many applications concerned with binary

ﬂuid ﬂows with non-matched densities including adaptive strategies. To our

5

knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work with a linear energy stable time scheme for

quasi-incompressible NSCH equations. In contrast to existing time-integration

schemes, we make use of both ρ and ˆρ in the discretization. This approach

contributes signiﬁcantly to the energy stability of the scheme, especially for

numerical computations with high density ratios.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we derive the

new thermodynamically consistent quasi-incompressible model for two-phase

ﬂows and a variant thereof. Section 3 presents a weak form of the system

and a time-discrete scheme including proofs of continuous and discrete energy

dissipation. In Section 4, we exhibit the properties of our fully-discrete scheme

based on numerical computations using standard ﬁnite elements as a spatial

discretization. Section 5 presents concluding remarks.

2. Derivation of the Quasi-Incompressible NSCH Model

In this section, we present a new quasi–incompressible diﬀuse–interface NSCH

model with gravity. The model is inspired by [3]. We derive the model for an

isothermal mixture with a thin interfacial region between two immiscible and in-

compressible ﬂuids. The derivation is based on the theory of mixtures [6], which

assumes that the mass, momentum and energy are conserved at the constituent

level as well as within the mixture. The model is derived via application of the

Coleman-Noll procedure [10] to the energy dissipation inequality, which enforces

the second law of thermodynamics and endows the model with thermodynamic

consistency.

2.1. Continuum theory of mixtures

To provide a setting for our model, we consider an open bounded domain
Ω ⊂ Rd (d = 2, 3) and label the ﬂuids of the binary mixture by k = 1, 2. Let the
volume fraction 1 be φk = Vk/V , where Vk is the volume of the kth component

1The volume fraction and mass concentration are deﬁned by division of volume and mass

of the ﬂuids and the mixture. However, their actual deﬁnitions are the limit of the volume and

6

and V is the total volume of the mixture. Similarly, the mass concentration can

be deﬁned as ck = Mk/M with the mass of the kth component, Mk, and the

total mass of the mixture, M . Particularly, since M =(cid:80)
we have(cid:80)

ck =(cid:80)

φk = 1.

k

Mk and V =(cid:80)

Vk,

Each component of the ﬂuid is assumed to be incompressible, so we describe

a constant speciﬁc density ρk = Mk/Vk for k = 1, 2. Similarly, partial mass

densities can be deﬁned as ˜ρk = Mk/V , which are non-constant and their sum

is the total mass density of the mixture, ρ =(cid:80)

˜ρk. Note that the three densities

are related by

k

˜ρk = ρkφk = ρck.

(2)

Unlike the individual components, the mixture is not assumed to be incom-

pressible. We assume the mixture density to be a function of an order parameter
φ such that ρ ≡ ˆρ(φ), where φ is related to the volume fractions according to
φ := φ1 − φ2. It is to be noted that the total density can generally be chosen as
a function of various combinations of volume or mass fractions, some of which

are mentioned in [2]. We deﬁne the order parameter φ based on the volumes
V1, V2 and V by V1/V = (1 + φ)/2 and V2/V = (1 − φ)/2, which leads to the
relations ˜ρ1 = ρ1(1 + φ)/2 and ˜ρ2 = ρ2(1 − φ)/2, for φ ∈ [−1, 1]. This implies
the following algebraic equation for the mixture density:

˜ρ1 + ˜ρ2 = ρ1

(3)

Note that ˆρ(φ) coincides with the mixture density ρ, where both represent the

non-constant mixture density. Although ρ and ˆρ := ˆρ(φ) coincide, they serve

separate roles in the formulation and, accordingly, can not be used interchange-

ably. We introduce the mixture velocity v as the mass averaged/barycentric

velocity:

2.2. Balance Equations

Balance of mass for the individual constituents k = 1, 2 can be written as

∂t ˜ρk + ∇ · (˜ρkvk) = 0,

(5)

where we assume no mass production of or conversion between the constituents,

which is reﬂected in the zero right hand side.

We replace ˜ρ1 and ˜ρ2 by ρ1(1 + φ)/2 and ρ2(1− φ)/2 in (5), respectively, use
the deﬁnition of diﬀusion velocity according to wk = vk − v and relation (2) to
obtain

Multiplying (6) and (7) by 1/ρ1 and 1/ρ2, respectively, and subtracting the

resulting equations gives the phase equation:

˙φ + φ∇ · v + ∇ · h = 0

(8)

where h = φ1w1 − φ2w2 is the mass ﬂux due to diﬀusive changes in the phase
variable φ and ˙x is the material derivative ˙x = ∂tx + v·∇x for any ﬁeld variable
x.

Similarly, summing the equations in (6)-(7) and using the identity ρ1φ1w1 +

ρ2φ2w2 = 0, which can be inferred from (4), we obtain the following quasi-

incompressibility relation for the mixture velocity v:

where

∇ · v + α∇ · h = 0,

α =

ρ2 − ρ1
ρ2 + ρ1

(9)

(10)

is a constant. Note that, combining (8) and (9) we obtain the following relation

between the phase variable and the mixture velocity:

∇ · v =

˙φ.

(11)

Remark 1. If the speciﬁc densities are equal, that is, ρ1 = ρ2, then (9) reduces
to ∇ · v = 0. The barycentric velocity is therefore solenoidal if the speciﬁc
densities of the two components coincide, but not generally otherwise.

Balance of mass is not only satisﬁed for the components, but also for the

mixture. Indeed, summing (5) in k, we obtain

∂tρ + ∇ · (ρv) = 0

˙ρ + ρ∇ · v = 0

or

and similarly

∂t ˆρ + ∇ · (ˆρv) = 0,

(12)

(13)

where ˆρ is the algebraic deﬁnition of the mixture density as in (3). Then, from

(13) it follows that

∇ · v = − 1
ˆρ

˙ˆρ = − 1
ˆρ

∂ ˆρ

˙φ,

(14)

which is another identity for the divergence of the mixture velocity in (9). Ad-

ditionally, from (11) and (14), we have

− 1
ˆρ

∂ ˆρ
∂φ

=

α

1 − αφ

,

(15)

where ∂ ˆρ/∂φ is constant.

For our model, we are interested in the velocity of the mixture, v, more than

the speciﬁc velocities, vk. Therefore, instead of introducing the momentum

equation for each constituent, we will consider the mixture momentum balance

∂t(ρv) + ∇ · (ρv ⊗ v) = ∇ · T + b,

where T is the stress tensor of the mixture and b is the body force. By (12),

this can be simpliﬁed to

ρ ˙v = ∇ · T + b.

(16)

In particular, we only consider (vertical) gravitational eﬀects as the speciﬁc
body force term. Accordingly, in (16), b is replaced by −ˆρgˆj, where g is the
gravitational acceleration and ˆj is the vertical component of the unit vector in
Cartesian coordinate system, viz. ˆj = ∇y = (0, 1)T .

9

Remark 2. An alternative mixture velocity deﬁnition to (4) is the volume-

averaged velocity v = φ1v1 + φ2v2, see [2, 3, 7, 16]. This choice would reduce
(9) to ∇ · v = 0 even for non-matching densities, i.e. for ρ1 (cid:54)= ρ2. However,
this simpliﬁcation requires a change in the conservation equations for mass and

momentum to obtain a thermodynamically consistent model. More explicitly,

volume averaged velocity leads to an additional term in the mass and momentum

conservation equations related to diﬀusion of components in order to describe

the density ﬂux [2].

2.3. The Second Axiom of Thermodynamics

Similar to the momentum equation (16), we assume the balance of internal

energy not for the individual constituents, but for the mixture. However, in-

stead of introducing the balance of energy equation here, we directly consider

the second axiom of thermodynamics in the form of an energy dissipation in-

equality; see also [24]. The connection between the internal-energy density and

the dissipation inequality is made via the Helmholtz free-energy density, ρψ.

Let us consider the following energy dissipation inequality in terms of the free
energy ρψ, the kinetic and gravitational potential energy K(P) and G(P), the
total work done by macro- and micro-stresses W (P) and the energy transported
by diﬀusion M (P):

(cid:90)

(cid:16)

P(t)

(cid:17)

ρψ + K(P) + G(P)

dv ≤ W (P) − M (P),

(17)

where P denotes any time-dependent subset of Ω, which moves with the mixture
velocity v.

Equation (17) implies that the work on P plus the rate at which free energy
is transported to P by diﬀusion always exceed the sum of the increase in free,
kinetic and the gravitational potential energy. Speciﬁcally, following [22] we

consider

Upon substituting (18) and (19) into (17) and applying the Reynolds trans-

port theorem, we obtain

Then using the conservation laws (12), (13) and (16) on the left hand side and

the divergence theorem on the right hand side of the inequality, the following

local form of (20) is obtained:

ρ ˙ψ − T : ∇v − ∇ · ( ˙φξ) + ∇ · (µh) ≤ 0.

(21)

By applying the product rule to the last two terms in (21) and introducing

˙ρψ = ρ ˙ψ + ψ ˙ρ and T = T0 − pI,

we obtain

˙ρψ − ψ ˙ρ − T0 : ∇v + p∇ · v − ˙φ∇ · ξ − ξ∇( ˙φ) + µ∇ · h + h · ∇µ ≤ 0.

(22)
The partition T = T0− pI is such that −pI corresponds to the hydro-static part
of the stress tensor T. The reduced dissipation inequality (22) forms the basis for

determining our class of admissible constitutive relations and the independent

variables.

Remark 3. We deﬁne ψ as the density of the Helmholtz free energy with respect

to the mass measure and, accordingly, ρψ as the volumetric free-energy density.

In many other formulations (e.g.

[2, 24]), ψ is deﬁned directly as volumetric

free energy. This model assumption is crucial to simplify the ﬁnal derived model

such that the momentum equation has a density-free capillary force term, which

enables the construction of a linear time scheme.

2.4. Constitutive Equations and Coleman-Noll Procedure

We consider the independent variables: φ, v, µ, p and the dependent func-

tions: ρψ, ˆρ, T, h, ξ. The explicit form of the functions in terms of independent

variables is determined via the Coleman-Noll procedure [10, 23], except ˆρ which

has been deﬁned previously in (3). We start with the constitutive assumption

for the energy density ρψ according to ρψ = (cid:99)ρψ(φ,∇φ), which gives

Furthermore, on account of

(24)

Using the identities (9), (12) and (24), the inequality (22) can be recast into

where pI : ∇v = p∇ · v. In (25), we have written each term as a contraction
of a dependent and an independent variable except for the boxed terms. The

boxed terms can be recast into the same form by means of the relations

where according to the standard Coleman-Noll argument [23], the form of the

2.5. Special choice of free energy and the Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard Equation

Remark 5. One may note that the two variants (35e) and (35f) of the mixture

density both appear in the equation of motion (35c). More explicitly, the den-

sity in (35e) appears in the ρ ˙v term, while the density in (35f) appears in the
gravity term ˆρgˆj. (35f) also appears in the equation of chemical potential (35b).

Deﬁning the mixture densities ρ and ˆρ via two separate equations in (35e) and

(35f) is crucial to obtain an energy dissipative time-discrete scheme. Besides,

these two deﬁnitions of the mixture density are consistent by construction; see

Section 2.1.

Remark 6. The components of the stress in (35c) can be endowed with spe-

ciﬁc physical interpretations. The tensor η(φ)
represents the
standard viscous stress tensor. Additionally, the tensors σε(∇φ ⊗ ∇φ) and

Equation (35c) can be reformulated such that the additional, complicated
stress terms assume a simpler form. To this end, we note that for σε∇·(∇φ⊗∇φ)

In the sequel, we will generally equip (37) with the following natural bound-

15

ary conditions:

∂nφ = ∂nµ = 0, v = 0

(38)
where ∂n(·) represents the normal-derivative in the trace sense. Also, for the
sake of simplicity, we restrict our considerations constant viscosity and mobility,

on ∂Ω,

i.e. η(φ) := η and m(φ) := m.

Remark 8. Other boundary conditions, e.g. of non-homogeneous form can be

considered as well. However, one should take into consideration that there is

a compatibility between the velocity v and the chemical potential µ due to the

quasi-incompressibility equation (37d), that is,

Remark 9. (An Alternative NSCH Model) Based on the same modeling as-

sumptions, we can derive an alternative quasi-incompressible model to (37).

Let us follow the same steps in the derivation until (25) and rewrite the term
p∇ · v using

∇ · v = α ˙φ + αφ∇ · v

Applying the Coleman Noll procedure to (41), we obtain the same equations as

(30) and (31) and the following two equations for chemical potential and the

stress tensor:

Remark 10. It can be observed that the models (37) and (43) are equivalent.

Using the relation (15), if the pressure p in (37b) and (37c) is redeﬁned by
p = (1 − αφ)˜p, then one obtains (43b) and (43c).

2.6. Non-dimensionalization

We perform the non-dimensionalization of (37) based on physical properties

of the liquid associated with the density ρ1, which are the characteristic scales
of length, L∗, velocity, U∗ and P∗ = L∗/σ. Considering that φ is already

a dimensionless phase ﬁeld variable, the governing dimensionless variables are

given by:

¯x =

where P∗ is used for both dimensionless pressure and chemical potential. sup-

3. Energy-Dissipative Numerical Method

We constructed our model (44) based on thermodynamic consistency, which

is equivalent to satisfying the second axiom of thermodynamics. The axiom

demands entropy production which in turn implies dissipation of total energy
E, i.e. according to (45), dtE ≤ 0. To maintain stability in numerical computa-
tions, this physical dissipation should be observed at the discrete level, as it is

18

in the continuous PDE model. In this section, for completeness, we ﬁrst present

the continuous energy dissipation for the weak formulation of (44). Then we

present a linearly implicit, ﬁrst order accurate time-integration scheme. We

restrict ourselves here only to time-discretization and prove the discrete dissi-

pation for a space-continuous semi-discrete model.

3.1. Energy Dissipative Weak Formulation

We assume that the natural boundary conditions (38) hold. The system of

diﬀerential equations in (44) subject to (38) can be condensed into the following
weak form: Find φ, µ ∈ H 1(Ω), v ∈ H1(Ω), p ∈ L2(Ω) such that

Note that the weak forms of the mixture densities ˆρ and ρ are not included

in (46), because ˆρ is deﬁned via algebraic equation (44f) and it can be replaced

with its deﬁnition in (46). Similarly, ρ is related to the model with respect to

the mass conservation equation (44e) and it is not solved as part of the system

(46). However, for a meaningful weak form, we require the mixture densities to
satisfy ρ, ˆρ ∈ L2(Ω). Non-homogeneous boundary conditions would result in a
non-zero right hand side for the weak form (46).

Theorem 1. Let φ, µ, v, p be a suﬃciently smooth solution to (46) subject to the

boundary condition (38). Assume also that ρ and ˆρ be positive and determined

by (44e) and (44f), respectively. Then the following energy dissipation relation

Energy dissipation, which has been stated and proved in Theorem 1, is a

fundamental structural property (e.g. connected with stability). This property

should be preserved in discrete approximations: see Section 3.2. Additionally,

conservation of mass and phase are other structural properties of the NSCH

model to be retained by discrete approximation. The continuity equation (44e)

and the boundary conditions deﬁned in (38) imply conservation of mass:

3.2. Energy Dissipative First Order Stable Time Scheme

In this section, we introduce a linear ﬁnite diﬀerence time-integration scheme

for model (44). Instead of the weak form, we propose our scheme in the context

of the strong form of the PDE to present it with a clear algorithm chart.

Let the time interval (0, T ) be divided into N sub-intervals of constant time
step size, ∆t = tn+1 − tn for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N − 1. The scheme presented in
Algorithm 1 is coupled, ﬁrst order and energy-dissipative. The properties of the

scheme are stated and proved in Theorem 2.

In the algorithm, except for the initialization (in which we take ˆρ0 = ρ0), we

involve both densities ˆρn and ρn using the equations (54) and (57), respectively.

Due to this approach and taking the velocity at the nth time step in the non-

linear term of the equation (55c), one easily infers that Algorithm 1 is linearly

implicit, i.e. equations (54)-(57) are linear in φn+1, µn+1, vn+1 and ρn+1.

Note also that a stabilizing term β

Cn (φn+1 − φn) has been introduced in the

deﬁnition of the chemical potential in (55b), where the constant stabilizing pa-

rameter β depends on the choice of f (φ) [35]. Speciﬁcally, for the f (φ) function

in (33), the scheme becomes stable if the stabilization constant is large enough.

Theorem 2. Consider the time stepping Algorithm 1 with the double well po-

tential f according to (33). Assume that ρn > 0 for all n. If the stabilization

parameter β in (55b) is selected in accordance with

β ≥ 1

(58)

then the scheme in Algorithm 1 is:

Remark 12. In (55b), any choice of β ≥ 1 yields a non-unique splitting of f (φ)
in a similar manner as in [14]. That is, for the splitting, the truncated f (φ) can

be composed of a convex (contractive) and a concave (expansive) part according
to f = fc − fe, where both functions fc and fe are convex. Particularly, in our
computations we choose β = 2 which reduces the stabilization into the linearly

stabilized splitting also proposed in [14] according to:

fully discrete schemes, the interested reader is referred to [15, 17].

4. Numerical Experiments

In this section, we present numerical experiments using our semi-implicit,

linear, energy dissipative scheme according to Algorithm 1. We consider 2D test

cases with matching and variable densities and show the unconditional stability

in discrete energy dissipation for large time step sizes. We also consider a falling

droplet to test the scheme with gravity. The parameters that are used for the

numerical simulations are listed below in Table 1.

Table 1: Parameters for the test cases

In the computations, for the spatial discretization, we use P1 − P1 ﬁnite-
elements for the phase variables φ and µ and P2 − P1 Taylor-Hood elements for
velocity v and pressure p on uniform meshes with square elements. For time

discretization, the stabilizing term is taken β = 2 and we apply homogeneous

Neumann and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions to φ, µ and v, re-

spectively; in (38). We also take zero initial velocity: v0(x) = 0. The initial

conditions for the phase variable, φ are determined on the basis of the initial

ﬂuid volumes.

4.1. Example 1: Coalescence for various density ratios

The goal of this test case is to investigate the time scheme for varying density

ratios, ρ2 : ρ1. To this end, we consider the coalescence of two suﬃciently close

but non-touching droplets in a domain Ω = (0, 1)2 with time step size ∆t = 0.05

for a matched density case with ρ2 : ρ1 = 1 : 1 and a very large density-

ratio scenario with two heavier droplets set in a lighter ambient medium with

ρ2 : ρ1 = 1 : 1000. For both cases, we ignore the eﬀect of gravity. The other

parameters are listed in Table 1. We set the initial condition

where the center of the big and small droplets are (x1, y1) = (0.4, 0.5) and

(x2, y2) = (0.78, 0.5), respectively, with the radii r1 = 0.25 and r2 = 0.1. We

cover Ω with a spatial mesh composed of 1282 uniform elements, which serves

us a support structure for the ﬁnite element spaces detailed above.

Figure 1 and the top row of Figure 2 present the evolution of the phase

variable for the matched and the non-matched densities, respectively, from t =

0.05 to 50.

It can be observed that both for the matched and non-matched

density cases, the droplets merge and form a circular droplet. The initial merges

can be attributed to diﬀusion, while the evolution to a stationary circular shape

is due to capillary forces which have the eﬀect of minimizing surface area.

The divergence of the mixture velocity for the non-matched density case

is also displayed in Figure 2. The corresponding plots illustrate the quasi-

incompressible behavior.
condition. A non-zero divergence for the mixture
velocity can be observed, i.e. ∇ · v (cid:54)= 0 at the moving interface, where com-
pressible mixing of phases occurs. In the pure phases away from the interface,

for which the individual components are incompressible, we indeed observe that
∇· v = 0. For the matching density case, on the contrary, the incompressibility
condition is satisﬁed at the interface as well as in the pure phases up to the

Figure 3 presents discrete mass and energy plots corresponding to evolution

in Figure 2. The total mass is preserved in time in accordance with Theorem 2.

The energy is indeed non-increasing in accordance with the discrete energy

dissipation property of the scheme according to Theorem 2.

4.2. Example 2: Breakup of two droplets with large time step size

This test case serves to study the stability of the scheme in Algorithm 1 for
large time steps. We consider a rectangular domain Ω = (−2, 2) × (−4, 4). The
domain is covered with a mesh composed of 75 × 150 elements, which again
supports ﬁnite-element approximation spaces as before. The considered setup

pertains to breakup of two droplets of identical size connected by a thin bridge.

We take the dimensionless parameters as presented Table 1.

Figure 4 shows snapshots of the simulation at diﬀerent times. The bridge

connecting the two droplets breaks up due to surface tension and the droplets

become circular in time during which surface area decreases.

and variable densities

The evolution of the energy for various time-step sizes is presented in Fig-

ure 5. In (a), the energy evolution is presented for very large time step sizes.

It is important to note that the time-integration scheme dissipates the energy

even at such very large time steps, in accordance with Theorem 2. The red

dissipation curve in (a) corresponds to the simulation presented in Figure 4.

For all dissipation curves in (a), we observe a stronger dissipation in the begin-

ning and then the dissipation rate decreases. The initial dissipation rate signals

the topological change by which the connected domain transforms into two dis-
joint domains. The asymptotic dissipation rate as t → ∞ corresponds to the
two droplets assuming a circular shape and the corresponding decrease in their

surface area. Note that for diﬀuse interface problems of NSCH type the time

step sizes in (a) are relatively large, since typical time step sizes for this type
of problems in the literature are order of 10−3. Therefore, our scheme provide
a strong basis for time adaptivity due to the stable results obtained with large

time step sizes. In Figure 5(b), we consider the energy dissipation of the time-
integration scheme in the limit ∆t → 0. To this end, we plot the energy versus
time for ∆t = {10−6, . . . , 10−3}. One can observe that the energy evolution
converges as ∆t → 0 and that small but ﬁnite dissipation remains in this limit,

The total mass is also preserved independent of the time step size (results not

4.3. Example 3: Pinching Droplet

In this test case, we explore the time-integration scheme subject to the eﬀect
of gravity. We consider a domain Ω = (−0.3, 0.3)× (−0.8, 0.8) composed of 60×
200 uniform square elements supporting the previously deﬁned ﬁnite-element

33

approximation spaces. Note that the computational domain is restricted to the

right half of Ω in view of symmetry. The initial condition corresponds to a

droplet attached to the top boundary:

φ0(x) = − tanh

and the parameters are taken as introduced in Table 1.

For this example, we set the density ratio ρ2 : ρ1 = 1 : 2.5. Since at large

density ratios the condition ρn > 0 can be violated for the chosen time step size.

and ∆t = 0.03

The evolution of the falling droplet is presented in Figure 6. Initially, the

droplet is attached to the upper wall. In time, due to gravity it moves downward

34

and after detaching from the upper wall it continues its vertical movement as

an almost circular shaped droplet. Upon reaching the bottom boundary, the

droplet spreads under the Neumann boundary condition for the phase variable φ,
and assumes an ellipsoidal shape as t → ∞, which corresponds to the equilibrium
shape under gravity.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented two new forms of a diﬀuse interface Navier–

Stokes Cahn–Hilliard model for binary ﬂuids with distinct densities. The model

is based on the assumption that the ﬂuids are individually incompressible but

their partial mixture shows a quasi-incompressible character. Accordingly, the

mixture velocity is generally non-solenoidal. We presented a time-integration

scheme for the model that is linearly implicit, energy stable and mass and phase

conserving independent of the time-step size. Central to the energy dissipation

property of the time -integration scheme we made use of two distinct but com-

patible deﬁnitions of the mixture density. We conducted numerical experiments

for breakup and coalescence of droplets and for a falling droplet subject to grav-

ity. The results verify the energy dissipation and mass and phase conservation

properties of the time-scheme for high density ratios and large time step sizes.

In the computations, compatible with the continuous model, a non-zero veloc-

ity divergence is observed near the interface due to the mixing between the

incompressible components of the ﬂuid.

We view the work presented in this paper as preparatory to time and space

adaptivity, using the unconditional energy-dissipation property of the scheme.

Adaptivity provides a basis for investigating complicated multiscale features

such as satellite droplets.
