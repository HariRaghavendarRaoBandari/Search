Abstract

We examine a thick accretion disc in the presence of external gravity and intrinsic dipolar
magnetic ﬁeld due to a non-rotating central object. In this paper, we generalize the Newtonian
theory of stationary axisymmetric resistive tori of Tripathy, Prasanna & Das (1990) by including
the fully general relativistic features. If we are to obtain the steady state conﬁguration, we have
to take into account the ﬁnite resistivity for the magnetoﬂuid in order to avoid the piling up of
the ﬁeld lines anywhere in the accretion discs. The eﬃcient value of conductivity must be much
smaller than the classical conductivity to be astrophysically interesting. The accreting plasma in
the presence of an external dipole magnetic ﬁeld gives rise to a current in the azimuthal direction.
The azimuthal current produced due to the motion of the magnetoﬂuid modiﬁes the magnetic ﬁeld
structure inside the disc and generates a poloidal magnetic ﬁeld for the disc. The solutions we
have found show that the radial inﬂow, pressure and density distributions are strongly modiﬁed
by the electrical conductivity both in relativistic and Newtonian regimes. However, the range of
conductivity coeﬃcient is diﬀerent for both regimes, as well as that of the angular momentum
parameter and the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit. Furthermore, it is shown that the
azimuthal velocity of the disc which is not dependent on conductivity is sub-Keplerian in all radial
distances for both regimes. Owing to the presence of pressure gradient and magnetic forces. This
work may also be important for the general relativistic computational magnetohydrodynamics that
suﬀers from the lack of exact analytic solutions that are needed to test computer codes.

Introduction

After the discovery of quasars in 1963, black holes have attracted a lot of attention in high-energy
astrophysics as energizers. Release of gravitational energy through the accretion of matter on to
a massive black hole is widely regarded as the most plausible origin of the enormous luminosities
of quasars. Spherical accretion on to massive black holes is ineﬃcient in releasing this energy, and
any accreting matter is likely to have the relative high angular momentum content. Hence, it is

1

common to invoke the presence of an accretion disc, that could be thin or thick depending upon
their geometrical shapes.

The standard theory of thin accretion discs is mostly based on the fundamental paper of Shakura
& Sunyaev (1973, hereafter SS73). Because of its relative simplicity and successful applicability,
this theory has achieved the status of a textbook paradigm. It introduces a Keplerian rotating gas
ﬂow which is stationary, rotationally symmetric, geometrically thin and optically thick. This ﬂow
has subcritical accretion rate with vertical hydrostatic equilibrium, negligible pressure gradients
and insigniﬁcant infall velocity. Moreover, it makes the physically reasonable and enormously
productive Ansatz about the turbulent viscosity which is parametrized with an alpha parameter.
The SS73 model has been found to be quite successful in reproducing at least the gross features of
the observations (see e.g. Frank, King & Raine 2002).

Novikov & Thorne (1973) then included general relativity and extended the SS73 model to
relativistic ﬂows around the rotating black holes. Studies wishing to model more accurately phe-
nomena beyond the SS73 model like time-dependent behavior, radiatively driven mass loss, various
instabilities etc. have stretched the SS73 model over the range of its limits. For a review of such
applications see e.g. Lin & Papaloizou (1996).

The common practice to treat accretion discs using the SS73 paradigm has always been accom-
panied by vertical averaging or in other word integrating the ﬂow equations in the vertical direction
(i.e. parallel to the rotation axis). Vertical averaging is a standard approximation in accretion disc
theory since a long time ago, owing to the simpliﬁcations it introduces (Mineshige & Umemura
1997; Gammie & Popham 1998; Tsuribe 1999). The physical motivation behind this approxima-
tion is that the vertical thickness of the disc is usually much smaller than the local radius, so that
the ﬂow velocities are likely to be more or less independent of height.
It is then reasonable to
expect that very little is lost by integrating out the vertical coordinate and employing the vertical
hydrostatic equilibrium.

In this paper we avoid the height-integration approximation and subsequently the vertical hy-
drostatic equilibrium. Instead, we set up the exact ﬂow equations for steady axisymmetric ﬂow in
the rθ plane. Consequently, the resulting vertical pressure gradient may cause the disc to bulge and
grow outwards from the equatorial plane, becoming a thick disc in which the vertical dimension of
the disc is comparable with its radial size. For a geometrically thick accretion disc that the pressure
forces play an essential role in its equilibrium structure, pressure provides a substantial support in
the radial as well as vertical direction. As a result, gravity of the central star is no longer balanced
by centrifugal force. Thus, the rotation law may be far from Keplerian distribution here.

The basic equations governing the motion of an axisymmetric stationary magnetoﬂuid disc
around a compact object in a curved space-time background are given by Prasanna, Tripathy &
Das (1989, hereafter PTD89). The behaviour of a ﬂuid in the presence of electromagnetic ﬁelds
is governed to a large extent by the magnitude of the electrical conductivity.
In most of the
astrophysical phenomena, the ideal MHD approximation, in which the conductivity is actually
assumed to be inﬁnite, represents a very good approximation. In this case, the magnetic ﬂux is
conserved and the magnetic ﬁeld is frozen in the ﬂuid, being simply advected with it. Ideal MHD
equations neglect any eﬀect of resistivity on the dynamics. However, in cold, dense plasmas such
as might be expected at the centres of protostellar discs (Stone et al. 2000; Fleming & Stone
2003), discs in dwarf nova systems (Gammie & Menou 1998), the ionization fraction may become
so small that this approximation no longer holds and the conductivity must be assumed to be

2

ﬁnite. Moreover, in practice, even in the scenarios of hot plasmas like accretion discs around black
holes (Kudoh & Kaburaki 1996), and in Galactic centre (Melia & Kowalenkov 2001; Kaburaki et al.
2010), there will be spatial regions where the electrical conductivity is ﬁnite too. In these instances,
the resistive eﬀects, most notably, magnetic reconnection will be expected to occur in reality. It
will provide an important contribution to the energy losses from the system. Inclusion of a ﬁnite
resistivity is particularly essential for a non-viscous disc to liberate gravitational energy.

The ﬁrst analytical equilibrium solution including the conductivity for the plasma was obtained
by Kaburaki (1986, 1987). Although his equilibrium solutions were not self-consistent, but he
showed that similar to the standard viscous disc model of SS73, about one half of the gravitational
energy is released in the magnetized disc through the Joule dissipation. As a consequence, the
magnetic stress can take the place of viscous stress in the standard disc model, and extracts angular
momentum from the disc.

In recent decades, plenty of studies on the dynamics of accretion discs have been carried out
by applying some simplifying assumptions on the general equations derived by PTD89. The most
usual of these assumptions are thin disc approximation (Prasanna & Bhaskaran 1989; Prasanna
1989; Bhaskaran & Prasanna 1990) and ﬂow restriction only to the azimuthal component, with the
inherent assumption that the radial and meridional components are negligible in comparison with
the azimuthal one (Banerjee et al. 1997). Furthermore, Newtonian limit of relativistic equations
of PTD89 for a thick resistive plasma disc surrounding a non-rotating black hole with an intrinsic
dipolar magnetic ﬁeld has been examined by Tripathy, Prasanna & Das (1990, hereafter TPD90).
Despite the fact that for the ﬁrst time, they took into consideration all three components of the
ﬂow velocity of matter, but yet another important aspect in thick accretion disc theory around the
compact objects is left. Lacuna is the generalization of the Newtonian analysis of TPD90 to general
relativistic formalism wherein the space-time curvature produced by the strong gravitational ﬁeld
of the central body introduces the new features.

In this paper we ﬁll in this lacuna and follow the model drawn by TPD90, but put aside the
Newtonian limit and work in the fully relativistic framework. We investigate the general relativistic
eﬀects by choosing the Schwarzschild geometry and ignore the self-gravity contribution of the disc.
Further, we consider the central object to possess a poloidal magnetic ﬁeld which has the usual
dipolar form in the asymptotic limit of the Schwarzschild metric. We are not interested in outﬂowing
motion from the surface of the disc. Consequently, neglecting the meridional ﬂow (i.e. V θ = 0),
seems an admissible approximation as a simplifying assumption in solving equations (Gu et al.
2009). Therefore, we proceed to study a pressure-supported, accreting, stationary, axisymmetric,
conducting, magnetized thick disc around a compact object within the relativistic domain without
shear viscosity and meridional ﬂow.

The objective of this work is to attempt to understand the eﬀect of electrical conductivity and
the other free parameters on the dynamics of disc with approximations that allow the problem
to be treated mainly by analytical methods as far as possible. A brief outline of this paper is as
follows: In Section 2, we derive a set of dynamical basic equations in Schwarzschild background
and discuss the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration. In Section 3, the analytical and numerical solutions
of the relativistic disc are obtained and the eﬀects of various parameters involved in the governing
equations on these solutions are investigated. Newtonian limit of the relativistic solutions and
comparison of these two sets of solutions are practiced in Section 4. Section 5 summarizes our
conclusions.

2 GENERAL FORMULATION

2.1 Basic Equations

We are interested in relativistic magnetized ﬂow accreted from the source of plasma around a
non-rotating black hole in the form of a thick disc. Our desired magnetoﬂuid disc is in stationary
(∂t ≡ 0) and axisymmetric (∂ϕ ≡ 0). Further, it is not massive in comparison with the central
compact object. Hence, the self-gravity of the disc is considered to be negligible and the space-time
structure supporting the disc is determined entirely by the central body. Besides, energy of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld is regarded to be negligible as compared to the energy associated with the
mass of the central star. It means the electromagnetic ﬁelds do not inﬂuence the geometry, but
they can be modiﬁed by the background geometry that is deﬁned by the Schwarzschild metric

The fundamental unit of length is m = GM

mass of the central object, and c the speed of light. The Schwarzschild radial coordinate r may be
normalized with respect to m.

In general, motion of the magnetized plasma is described by three sets of general relativistic

MHD equations. These are the energy-momentum conservation laws

an electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor F ij satisfying Maxwell equations. The other ﬂuid variables are
the electric four-current density J and the electric conductivity σ which is assumed constant for
simplicity. We express the dynamical equations in terms of physical quantities by writing them in
the orthonormal tetrad frame appropriate to the Schwarzschild metric

There exists a minimal radius at which stable circular motion is still possible for the plasma
orbiting the central black hole. It deﬁnes the so-called innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) in
given background. For the Schwarzschild geometry, the radius of ISCO equals to 6m (Jefremov,
Tsupko & Bisnovatyi 2015). Although, if the surface magnetic ﬁeld of the central black hole is not
too high, it can reach well within the usual 6m limit, almost upto 3m (Bhaskaran & Prasanna 1990).
As a result, we presume the disc spreads in radial direction from 6m to 50m and in meridional
direction has the angular thickness π/3 on either side of the equator.

To determine the conﬁguration of magnetic ﬁeld lines and the velocity of MHD ﬂows streaming
along each magnetic ﬁeld line, we must solve the basic equations (1) - (4) self-consistently. We
expand the equations in local Lorentz frame noting to the fact that the Roman indices run from
0 to 3 and the Greek ones run from 1 to 3. Besides, we adopt the standard convention for the

summation over repeated indices. The zeroth component of equation (1) is the continuity equation

At the ﬁrst glance, the set of basic equations (5) -(14) seems rather complex to solve, and in
general requires the use of plausible simplifying assumptions. As a consequence of axisymmetry
of the problem, it looks reasonable to vanish the toroidal component of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
(E(ϕ) = B(ϕ) = 0). This, when used in the Maxwell equations (9) and (10) leads to the omission
of the poloidal current density (J (r) = J (θ) = 0). Afterwards, the Ohm law (equation 4) yields

2.2 Magnetic Field Conﬁguration

As a matter of fact, the magnetic ﬁeld in the MHD equations of the surrounding space of the central
black hole consists generally of two parts:

B = BS + BD.

BS represents the external magnetic ﬁeld generated by the current streaming outside the event
horizon of the central black hole, while BD is the disc ﬁeld caused by the current ﬂowing in the

Magnetodisc is also the region where (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

force acting on the current there. Therefore, within the disc, B can be replaced by BD with
suﬃcient accuracy. Indeed, the magnetic ﬁeld appearing in the equations of the previous sections
is just the same as BD, that its superscript D has been dropped for simplicity. From now on,
we use superscript only for the external ﬁeld BS. Dipolar magnetic ﬁeld is a proper model for
the magnetosphere of a black hole that results from current rings exterior to the event horizon

In order to visualize the ﬁeld line structure, it is useful to transform to a

where r0 and ϕ0 are the constants of integration and β is the ratio of the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld B(ϕ)

symmetry, ϕ0 can be set zero without any loss of generality. Inasmuch as the meridional structure
of the disc is presumed to extend to about 60◦ on either side of the equatorial plane, necessity of
the continuity of the magnetic ﬁeld lines across the disc boundary surface (i.e. θ = π/6) demands

Fig. 1 shows a typical proﬁle of the magnetic ﬁeld structure in the meridional plane without
(Fig. ??a) and with the disc ﬁeld (Fig. ??b). As pointed out by Ghosh & Lamb (1978), magnetic
lines of force can penetrate the accretion disc owing to the presence of a ﬁnite conductivity. Because,
the value of σ is a measure of the rate of slippage of ﬁeld lines through the disc plasma. It is seen
that, inside the disc (Fig. ??b), the penetrating ﬁeld lines are pushed outward as parallel to the z
axis. The constant ﬁeld lines of the disc are connected with the undistorted external ﬁeld lines at
the surface of the disc and are continuous at the boundary surface as postulated earlier. It does
not depend on the value of k as well.

Contrary to the azimuthal velocity (equation 24), the radial velocity is dependent on conductivity.
Here, a discussion for probable values of the electrical conductivity of the magnetoﬂuid comes up
due to the condition |V (r)| < V (ϕ) < c. We choose the value of conductivity in the interval

This choice refers to the fact that below the lower bound, the condition |V (r)| < V (ϕ) is disturbed
|V (r)| << c).
and above the upper bound, the radial velocity enters the Newtonian region (i.e.
This range for conductivity is much smaller than the classical conductivity that is estimated by

Here, p0 that has been appeared as an integration constant, is indeed the pressure of the ISCO
(r0 = 6 m). Since it is expected that both pressure and density to be positive throughout the disc,
a natural restriction is exerted on p0.

As accretion gives rise to radiation, the equilibrium conﬁguration is provided only when at
the inner layer, the hydrostatic gas pressure matches the radiation pressure pR, namely p0 = pR.

Under these circumstances, a subcritical regime (i.e.
Because, at a subcritical rate of ﬂow of matter into the Roche lobe of a black hole, it may be
assumed that most of the inﬂowing matter is accreted. However, at supercritical value of inﬂow, an
eﬀective outﬂow of matter may take place under the inﬂuence of radiation pressure. It disturbs the
equilibrium conﬁguration of the disc. As a result, to have an equilibrium structure, we choose the
subcritical regime of accretion. Besides, due to no meridional ﬂow approximation (i.e. V (θ) = 0)
employed in our calculations, which is requisite in the absence of outﬂows, this regime has been
preferred.

year , the luminosity of the disc is of the
order of L = 1034− 1036 erg

˙M = 10−12 − 10−10 M⊙

in the ultraviolet and soft X-ray bands, which are inaccessible to direct observations. When the
rate of accretion increases, the luminosity grows linearly and the eﬀective temperature of radiation

With these observations, it seems suitable to choose C(θ = π

year , disc is found to be a powerful X-ray source with luminosity
s and an eﬀective temperature of radiation T = 107 − 108K. It radiates also in
year as a boundary
condition for integrating the diﬀerential equation (46) and T = 107K for the temperature of ISCO
(r0 = 6m). Thus, the radiation pressure in that layer is speciﬁed conveniently (i.e. p0 = 1
3 a T 4,
where the radiation constant a = 7.565767 × 10−16J/m3K 4).
Figs 2 and 3 give the vertical or meridional structure of all physical variables at some radial
distances represented in legend. As has been deduced from equation (38), mass accretion rate is
just dependent on θ. Accordingly, a proper set of the free parameters must be chosen so that the
mass accretion rate does not vary signiﬁcantly with the radial distances (Fig. 2a). Mass accretion
rate is negative as well as radial velocity. Their negativity indicates the inﬂow towards the central
black hole. Both radial inﬂow (Figs 2a and b) and rotation (Fig. 2c) of the disc slow down from
the disc surface (θ = π
2 ). Pressure shows the similar behavior too. It
falls from the surface towards the equator (Fig. 3a), whereas the density seems to remain nearly
constant there (Fig. 3b). This constancy refers to the fact that the variation of density in radial
direction is much larger than that in the meridional direction (Fig. 4d).

6 ) towards the equator (θ = π

The radial behaviour of the physical variables is plotted in Fig. 4. Close to the black hole
event horizon, the gas temperature and velocities become extremely high (Popham & Gammie
1998) and gradually fall oﬀ outwards. Fig. 4 conﬁrms this result as well. It demonstrates that in
radial direction, both radial (Fig. 4a) and rotational (Fig. 4b) velocities of the disc become faster
inwards. Pressure and density are the descending functions of the radial distance as well (Figs 4c
and d). The density falls oﬀ rapidly as r increases whereas pressure tends to remain constant after
an initial decrease.

The eﬀect of free parameters σ and k on some impressible physical variables is investigated by
plotting them as a function of r for diﬀerent values of σ (Fig. 5) and k (Fig. 6). Rotational velocity
is not aﬀected by these parameters. However, radial inﬂow velocity slows down with rising them
(Figs 5a and 6a). For lower values of σ, the pressure decrease outward is minimal. As σ becomes
larger, this diﬀerence becomes appreciable and also the pressure drops oﬀ (Fig. 5b) contrary to the
behavior of the density. The disc becomes denser with rising the conductivity (Fig. 5c) and free
parameter k (Fig. 6b).

Fig. 7 shows the meridional dependency of the pressure and density with respect to the angular
momentum parameter l. As disc rotates faster, both pressure (Fig. 7a) and density (Fig. 7b)
increase. However, ascending the pressure with l, is just signiﬁcant on the surface layers and
gradually this sensitivity diminishes towards the equator. Furthermore, higher the value of l, larger
the variation of density with θ.

Isodensity contours for diﬀerent values of σ and k are plotted in Figs 8 and 9 respectively. For
lower values of these parameters, the related isodensity contours occur in nearer radial distances
to central star.

Meridional ﬂow pattern for diﬀerent values of σ and k is depicted in Figs 10 and 11 respectively.

15

The ﬂow is represented by the arrows at a grid of points in the X-Z plane indicating the direction
of streamlines. As mentioned before, the conductivity ascent leads to decelerate the radial inﬂow
velocity, so that the rotation would be much faster than the radial inﬂow for large values of σ. We
would also have a rotating non-accreting equilibrium conﬁguration around the central star (Fig.
10). Opposing to this behaviour is observable in Fig. 11 with lowering k. Because in this case,
radial inﬂow velocity becomes faster than rotational velocity in such a way that for k = −3, inﬂow
occurs as pure free fall without any rotation.

4 Newtonian Limit and Comparison with the TPD90’s So-
lutions

To convince about the correctness of our solutions and also comparing with those of TPD90, one
may employ the Newtonian limit (i.e. m << 1 and V
c << 1) on the equations (24) - (32) and
acquires their Newtonian counterparts as follows:

These solutions (equations 49 - 58 and 61) are in exact agreement with those obtained by TPD90.
Now, it deserves to compare the relativistic and Newtonian solutions both qualitatively and quanti-
tatively. In close vicinity of a black hole, the Newtonian description is only a rough approximation
and it is natural to expect the eﬀects of spacetime curvature there. Thus, employing the New-
tonian approximation is just permissible on farther radial distances relative to central compact
object. That is why the ISCO is placed farther for Newtonian regime. Another quantitative dif-
ference rests on the range of velocities (Figs 12a,b and 13a,b). It demands two diﬀerent ranges for
the free parameters σ and l for both regimes (Table 1). In Newtonian regime, this allowed range
of free parameters results in a huge reduction in the density of the disc relative to the relativistic
regime (Fig. 12c). Besides that the density has an obvious quantitative diﬀerence in both regimes,
it behaves qualitatively diﬀerent as well. The descending radial gradient density in relativistic
regime is steeper than Newtonian regime (Fig. 13c). The pressure acts qualitatively diﬀerent in
both regimes as well as density (Figs 12d and 13d). In relativistic regime, pressure diminishes from
the layer surface toward the equator in meridional direction. However, exactly contrary to this
behaviour can be seen in Newtonian regime (Fig. 12d). Moreover, in relativistic regime, in radial
direction, pressure decreases rapidly in the inner radial distances, then steadies itself and reaches
an almost constant value as one goes outwards in the disc. Whereas in Newtonian regime, pressure
falls oﬀ rapidly (Fig. 13d). Figs 14 and 15 have been depicted to illustrate the role of σ and k
in Newtonian regime respectively. With respect to these free parameters, all impressible physical
variables behave similarly in both regimes (Figs 14a,c and 15), except the pressure. In Newtonian
regime, quite the opposite to the relativistic regime, pressure rises with an increase in conductivity
(Fig. 14b).

In this paper, we ﬁnd a self-consistent solution of fully relativistic equations for a thick disc around
a compact object having the radial and azimuthal components of the ﬂow velocity non-zero. In
general, it is not easy to solve this set of coupled partial diﬀerential equations without invoking the
simplifying assumptions. Mainly because these equations are so complicated and highly non-linear,
especially when the disc is magnetized. We have included a ﬁnite conductivity for the plasma
and have ignored the shear viscosity and self-gravity of the disc. Despite the great simpliﬁcations
coming from these assumptions, the scenario is still physically reasonable and non-trivial. Few
variety of degrees of freedom can be captured and the free parameters can be conveniently chosen
in order to describe an astrophysically relevent situation.

Using Ohm law explicitly, we have derived a self-consistent equilibrium solution for a plasma
disc in the presence of an external stellar dipolar magnetic ﬁeld along with a self-consistently gen-
erated poloidal magnetic ﬁeld of the disc. This class of solutions is somewhat a general relativistic
generalization of the Newtonian solutions obtained by TPD90. The space-time curvature produced
by the strong gravitational ﬁeld of the central body modiﬁes the magnetic ﬁelds and other physical
variables relative to the Newtonian case. However, similar to Newtonian model of TPD90, the
magnetic ﬁeld lines inside the disc are constant in nature.

The meridional structure of our magnetized thick disc is mainly determined by the force balance
of the vertical component of the plasma pressure gradient, magnetic and centrifugal forces rather
than that of gravity and gas pressure like in the standard viscous disc model. The existence of
such structure, in fact, encourages one to look for generalizations of the analysis to cases having
meridional ﬂow (i.e. V θ 6= 0). Of course, such more complicated choice requires more complicated
calculations. This might be suggestive of generating the jets from the disc. Such analyses of the
thick accretion disc dynamics are in progress, but are beyond the scope of the present paper.

Even if such resistive tori with foregoing particular characteristics do not exist in nature, the
exact solutions presented here can still be useful for numerical general relativistic MHD, which has
attracted a lot of interest (Koide, Shibata & Kudoh 1999; Komissarov 2004; Anton et al. 2006).
