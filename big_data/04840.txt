ABSTRACT

We quantify the contribution of Lyα ﬂuorescence to observed spatially extended Lyα halos around
Lyα emitters (LAE) at redshift z = 3.1. The key physical quantities that describe the ﬂuorescent
signal include (i) the distribution of cold gas in the circum-galactic medium (CGM); we explore simple
analytic models and ﬁtting functions to recent hydrodynamical simulations; (ii) local variations in the
ionizing background due to ionizing sources that cluster around the central galaxy. We account for
clustering by boosting the observationally inferred volumetric production rate of ionizing photons,
LyC, by a factor 1 + ξLyC(r), in which ξLyC(r) quantiﬁes the clustering of ionizing sources around
the central galaxy. We compute ξLyC(r) by assigning an “eﬀective” bias parameter to the ionizing
sources. This novel approach allows us to quantify our ignorance of the population of ionizing sources
in a simple parametrized form. We ﬁnd a maximum enhancement in the local ionizing background in
the range 50 − 200 at r ∼ 10 physical kpc. For spatially uncorrelated ionizing sources and ﬂuorescing
clouds we ﬁnd that ﬂuorescence can contribute up to ∼ 50 − 60% of the observed spatially extended
Lyα emission. We brieﬂy discuss how future observations can shed light on the nature of Lyα halos
around star forming galaxies.

INTRODUCTION

The gaseous region out to 300 kpc around galaxies, the
so called circum-galactic medium (CGM), plays an im-
portant role when it comes to studying the properties
and characteristics of the galaxy population (e.g., Bah-
call & Spitzer 1969). The CGM connects galaxies and
the intergalactic medium (IGM), via gas accretion in-
ﬂows and feedback-driven outﬂows. Therefore, studying
these regions at diﬀerent redshifts provides invaluable in-
formation about the properties, formation and evolution
of galaxies (e.g., Steidel et al. 2010, 2011; Tumlinson et al.
2011; Dijkstra & Kramer 2012; Cantalupo et al. 2012,
2014; Rahmati et al. 2015).

The Lyman alpha (Lyα hereafter) radiation, which cor-
responds to the transition from the 2 2 P state to the
ground state of the hydrogen atom with a line centre
wavelength at 1215.67 ˚A, provides an excellent tool for
studying hydrogen gas in the CGM (see Barnes et al.
2014; Dijkstra 2014; Hayes 2015, for detailed reviews).
The CGM has been detected in Lyα absorption using
galaxy-galaxy (e.g., Rudie et al. 2012), galaxy-quasar
(e.g., Rakic et al. 2012) and quasar-quasar (e.g., Hen-
nawi & Prochaska 2013; Prochaska et al. 2013) pairs.
However, Lyα has also been observed in emission around
low redshift galaxies (e.g., ¨Ostlin et al. 2009; Guaita
et al. 2015), radio-loud galaxies (RLG; e.g., Saito et al.

1 l.m.ribas@astro.uio.no

2015) and Lyα blobs (e.g., Fynbo et al. 1999; Steidel
et al. 2000; Matsuda et al. 2004; Saito et al. 2006; Ao
et al. 2015). In addition, recent analyses have indicated
that all star forming galaxies may be surrounded by a
faint Lyα emission from the CGM, at surface bright-
ness levels of ∼ 10−19erg s−1 cm−2 arcsec−2. Some stud-
ies used stacking analyses to uncover this faint signal
out to ∼ 100 physical kpc (e.g., Hayashino et al. 2004;
Steidel et al. 2011; Matsuda et al. 2012; Momose et al.
2014, 2015), although not all obtained positive detections
(Jiang et al. 2013; Feldmeier et al. 2013). Individual de-
tections have also been reported, and some of them con-
sider the inclusion of the spectra (e.g., Wisotzki et al.
2015, see also Rauch et al. (2008a,b)). The Lyα spectral
line shape contains information on the gas kinematics
(Shapley et al. 2003; Verhamme et al. 2006; Dijkstra &
Kramer 2012), while the spatial extent of Lyα emission
(and absorption) traces the spatial distribution of hydro-
gen gas (Steidel et al. 2010, 2011).

The origin of the spatially extended Lyα emission
around galaxies (Lyα halos; LAHs) can be attributed
to (i) scattering: neutral hydrogen gas in the CGM can
scatter Lyα photons that were produced in the inner part
of galaxies, and which subsequently escaped from the in-
terstellar medium (see, e.g., Laursen & Sommer-Larsen
2007; Laursen et al. 2011; Zheng et al. 2010; Steidel et al.
2011; Zheng et al. 2011; Dijkstra & Kramer 2012; Ver-
hamme et al. 2012); and (ii) in situ production: Lyα
can be emitted by hydrogen atoms in the CGM follow-
ing collisional excitation and/or recombination. Colli-

sional excitation of the Lyα transition in atomic hydro-
gen by free electrons reduces the thermal energy - and
thus cools - the circum-galactic gas (e.g., Haiman et al.
2000; Fardal et al. 2001; Dijkstra & Loeb 2009; Faucher-
Gigu`ere et al. 2010; Rosdahl & Blaizot 2012). Radiative
ionizations can produce Lyα photons in a process called
‘ﬂuorescence’: ionizing photons that are produced inside
a galaxy (Furlanetto et al. 2005; Weidinger et al. 2005;
Nagamine et al. 2010), but also those photons coming
from distant sources such as quasars or other galaxies
(Haiman & Rees 2001; Alam & Miralda-Escud´e 2002;
Cantalupo et al. 2005; Adelberger et al. 2006; Cantalupo
et al. 2007; Rauch et al. 2008a,b; Kollmeier et al. 2010;
Hennawi & Prochaska 2013; Cantalupo et al. 2014), can
photoionize the circum-galactic hydrogen which recom-
bines almost immediately. Approximately 66% (42%) of
the recombinations2 produce Lyα for case-B (case-A) re-
combination (Gould & Weinberg 1996). It is currently
still unclear what the main physical mechanism behind
LAHs is, and what their relation with the more luminous
Lyα ‘blobs’ is.

In this work, we revisit the eﬀect of ﬂuorescence. This
is motivated by the observed dependence of Lyα surface
brightness proﬁles on the local overdensity: as the mean
number of Lyα emitting galaxies within a sphere of ra-
dius ∼ 2 Mpc h−1 increases, the spatial extend of the
Lyα halos increases (Steidel et al. 2011; Matsuda et al.
2012; Chiang et al. 2015). This dependence is naturally
expected when the Lyα emission is powered by ﬂuores-
cence, as we expect the (average) intensity of the ionizing
radiation ﬁeld to be enhanced in overdense regions. Our
main goal is to investigate whether, and under which con-
ditions, ﬂuorescence in the CGM can give rise to the ob-
served Lyα halos (and their dependence on overdensity).
This is an interesting question to address because, as we
will show in this work, it constrains spatial variations in
the ionizing background, which in turn relate to the es-
cape of ionizing photons from galaxies. Our work focuses
on Lyα emitters (LAEs) at redshift z = 3.1. This allows
us to compare with the work by Matsuda et al. (2012),
who presented their results with respect to LAE overden-
sity at this redshift. At z= 3.1 stellar radiation provides
the major contribution to the ionizing background (e.g.,
Faucher-Gigu`ere et al. 2008). In a companion paper, we
will focus on the contribution of Lyα emission from satel-
lite galaxies to LAHs.

The outline of this paper is as follows: we present our
main formalism for computing the surface brightness in
ﬂuorescent Lyα in § 2. This formalism shows that the
two key model ingredients are (i ) the local photoioniza-
tion rate Γ(r), and (ii ) the distribution of neutral hy-
drogen gas in the CGM. We present the models for the
calculation of these ingredients in § 3, and we show our
main results in § 4. We discuss the shortcomings of our
model in § 5, before concluding in § 6.

2. GENERAL FORMALISM

2 Note that absorption of higher-order Lyman series photons can
also give rise to ﬂuorescent Lyα emission. This process can increase
Lyα emission as discussed in, e.g., Furlanetto et al. (2005).

In this section, we introduce the general formalism for
the calculation of the Lyα surface brightness proﬁle. This
will highlight the main ingredients that have to be as-
sessed in more detail, namely (i) the characteristics of the
circum-galactic medium around the central galaxy, and
(ii) the ionizing radiation ﬁeld aﬀecting this medium.

It is well known that the environment of galaxies con-
tains cold optically thick gas (e.g., Bosma 1981; Bergeron
1986; Kunth et al. 1998; Mo & Miralda-Escude 1996;
Steidel et al. 2010). We assume that the central galaxy
contains a spherically symmetric distribution of cold gas
clumps embedded within a hot medium. It is important
to mention here that our formalism does not take into
account a correlation between self shielding gas and the
surrounding ionizing sources, thus making our calcula-
tions conservative. We brieﬂy discuss the importance of
this correlation for the boost of the ﬂuorescent signal in
§ 5. The distribution of clumps can be characterized by
their ‘covering factor’, fc(r), which denotes the number
of self-shielding clumps along a diﬀerential length at a
distance r from the central galaxy (which in the present
paper we consider to be an LAE). Many useful quantities
can be expressed in terms of fc(r).

(cid:82) ∞

For example,

the total number of clumps along
a sightline at impact parameter b is Nclump(b) =
−∞ ds fc(r[b, s]), where s denotes the line-of-sight co-
b2 + s2,
ordinate. The distance from the galaxy is r =
and so we can write

√

Nclump(b) = 2

r dr√
r2 − b2

fc(r) .

(1)

The parameter Nclump(b) denotes the average number of
clumps, and the actual number at a given impact param-
eter ﬂuctuates around this mean due to the discrete na-
ture of the clumps. The probability of ﬁnding at least one
clump at impact parameter b is P (N ≥ 1) = 1 − P (N =
0), where P (N = 0) denotes the Poisson probability of
ﬁnding no clumps at impact parameter b. For a Poisson
distribution, the probability of ﬁnding at least one clump
at impact parameter b is therefore

P (Nclump ≥ 1, b) = 1 − exp (−Nclump(b)) .

(2)
The quantity P (Nclump ≥ 1, b) is useful when comparing
to recent results from hydrodynamical simulations.

We can also compute the Lyα surface brightness pro-
duced by ﬂuorescence at a given impact parameter b from
fc(r) as

where we emphazise that ΓHI(r) denotes the photoion-
ization rate at a distance r from the central galaxy. This
‘local’ photoionization rate can diﬀer signiﬁcantly from
the overall background that is inferred from, e.g., Lyα
forest studies.

Eq. 4 highlights two key ingredients that determine the

Lyα surface brightness. These include:

1. The covering factor, fc(r), which describes the
spatial distribution of self-shielding clouds in the
CGM.

2. The value of the local photoionization rate, ΓHI(r),
which is determined by ionizing sources surround-
ing the galaxy, as well as the ionizing luminosity
from the central galaxy.

It is worth stressing that both these ingredients are dif-
ﬁcult to model from ﬁrst principles: (i ) the distribution
of cold gas in the CGM depends on the adopted feedback
prescriptions (e.g., Faucher-Gigu`ere et al. 2015; Faucher-
Giguere et al. 2016). Recent observations indicate that
there is a substantial amount of cold gas locked up in
small (∼ tens of pc) dense clumps not resolved in cosmo-
logical simulations (e.g., Cantalupo et al. 2014; Hennawi
et al. 2015); (ii ) The radial dependence of ΓHI depends on
the escape fraction of ionizing photons from both the cen-
tral galaxy and surrounding galaxies. The escape frac-
tion of ionizing photons, and its dependence on redshift
and galaxy type, is still highly uncertain. Given these
uncertainties, it is useful to have an analytic formalism
which allows for an eﬃcient exploration of the parame-
ter space. We describe both model ingredients in more
detail in the following section.

3. CHARACTERISING THE CGM AND ΓHI(R)

We divide this section into two parts: in the ﬁrst, we
describe our models for ΓHI(r) [§ 3.1], and in the second,
we describe our models for the CGM [§ 3.2].

3.1. Modeling ΓHI(r)

We divide the total photoionization rate ΓHI(r) at a
distance r from the central galaxy into (i) the contribu-
tion from the central galaxy itself, Γcen
HI (r), and (ii) the
contribution from all other ionizing sources, Γext

pendence of the escape fraction of ionizing photons in
terms of fc(r) as

For simplicity we assume that fesc(r = 0) = 100% and
that the radial dependence of fesc is determined entirely
by the self-shielding clumps. We show in Figure 3 that in
our models fesc reduces to values that are in good agree-
ment with existing observational constraints. We can
account for additional absorption of ionizing photons in
the ISM (or molecular clouds) of the galaxy by imposing
fesc(r = 0) < 100%. This restriction simply scales down
our predictions by the same factor.

(10)
where (cid:104)LyC(cid:105) denotes the cosmic average production rate
of ionizing photons per unit volume. Importantly, (cid:104)LyC(cid:105)
can be obtained directly from observations, by combining
measurements of λmfp and photoionization rates from the
Lyα forest (see, e.g., Kuhlen & Faucher-Gigu`ere 2012).
The use of (cid:104)LyC(cid:105) allows us to circumvent the above-
mentioned problems related to the integration limits for
the luminosity function and the use of assumptions for
the escape fraction of ionizing photons. The quantity
ξLyC(r) is the two point correlation function and quanti-
ﬁes how ionizing sources are clustered around the central
galaxy, and is clearly important in our analysis. In the
next section, we present how we calculate ξLyC(r), and
discuss other model assumptions.

3.1.3. Model Assumptions

Our approach is the following:

• For the central LAE we assume a SFR=10 M(cid:12) yr−1.
• We use for λmfp and (cid:104)LyC(cid:105), the values shown in
Table 1. These values are taken from the work of Kuhlen
& Faucher-Gigu`ere (2012) who compilated them from
Faucher-Gigu`ere et al. (2008); Songaila & Cowie (2010);
Prochaska et al. (2009); Bolton & Haehnelt (2007).

min = 10 pkpc. We tested the value r(cid:48)

• For the integral over r(cid:48) in Eq. 9, we set the lower
limit r(cid:48)
min = 5 pkpc
and we have seen that it does not change our results
signiﬁcantly. The upper limit is set to r(cid:48)
max = 100 λmfp,
considering the eﬀect of very distant galaxies. We have
explicitly tested that the eﬀect of considering a larger
limit does not change the results.

denotes the UV-luminosity function (number density
where
of galaxies in the range LUV ± dLUV),
˙nion(LUV) denotes the
production rate of ionizing photons for a galaxy with LUV, and
fesc denotes the escape fraction of ionizing photons.

• We consider that the real space two-point correlation
function for ionizing sources, ξLyC(r), can be described
as

ξLyC(r) = bLyC bLAE [ξ(r)1h + ξ(r)2h] ,

(11)

where we have used that the cross correlation function
of two diﬀerent tracers, each with its own bias, is given
by ξab(r) = bA bB ξ(r).
In our case, the ﬁrst tracer is
an LAE, and we take its scale depending bias, bLAE(r),
from ﬁtting the data in the work of Ouchi et al. (2010)
(See Appendix B.2 for a description of the procedure).
The bias bLyC denotes an ‘eﬀective’ bias of LyC emitting
sources. Since we currently do not know which galaxies
are LyC sources, we leave this quantity as a free parame-
ter, proportional to the bias of LAEs by a constant. Our
ﬁducial calculation assumes bLyC(r) = bLAE(r) but we
also discuss the eﬀect of considering other values. Fi-
nally, the terms ξ1h(r) and ξ2h(r) denote the 1-halo and
2-halo terms of the two-point correlation function of dark
matter. The 2-halo term accounts for clustering of mat-
ter in diﬀerent dark matter halos, while the 1-halo term
accounts for clustering of matter within the same halo.
In the Appendix B.1, we detail the calculations for the
obtention of these correlation functions.

• Matsuda et al. (2012) showed that the LAE over-
density is correlated with the spatial extent of Lyα halos
around LAEs. We compute the overdensity of LAEs,
δLAE, within a sphere of R = 2 Mpc h−1 around our
central galaxy as

δLAE =

nLAE − ¯nLAE

¯nLAE

where nLAE is the number of LAEs in the overdense re-
gion and ¯nLAE is the average value in the ﬁeld. We ob-
tain a value for the overdensity δLAE ∼ 1.5, which will be
important when comparing our results with other works.
• For simplicity, we assume that the escape fraction
of Lyα photons is f Lyα
esc = 100%. For the case of ﬂuores-
cence, Lyα photons escape from a medium with a column
density NHI ∼ 1017 cm2. For such low column densities
the eﬀects of dust are expected to be small (e.g., Gronke
et al. 2015, and references therein). Our results can be
scaled directly with f Lyα
esc assuming that the escape frac-
tion is not spatially dependent.

3.2. Modeling the CGM

Below we describe how we parametrize the CGM. We
construct models of the CGM using simpliﬁed clumpy
outﬂow models following Steidel et al. (2010) in § 3.2.1,
and Dijkstra & Kramer (2012) in § 3.2.2. In § 3.2.3 we
take an alternative approach, and adopt a ﬁtting formula
for the ‘area’ covering factor of self-shielding gas in the
cosmological hydrodynamical EAGLE simulations (Rah-
mati et al. 2015).

3.2.1. Steidel et al. (2010) - Clumpy Outﬂow Model

We follow Steidel et al. (2010) for this model, where
optically thick cold clumps are embedded within an out-
ﬂowing optically thin hot medium, lying within the radial

range rmin = 1 pkpc and rmax = 250 pkpc. The clumps
have a constant mass and are in pressure equilibrium
with the hot medium, the pressure of the latter varying
with distance as p(r) ∝ r−2 (Steidel et al. 2010).

The covering factor, fc(r),

Kramer 2012)

is given by (Dijkstra &

fc(r) = nc(r) σc(r),

(13)

where nc(r) denotes the number density of clumps at r
and σc(r) denotes their geometric cross-section. These
quantities are given by

σc(r) = π Rc(r)2 ,
nc(r) =
4 π r2 vc(r) ,

Cn

(14)

where Rc(r) denotes the cloud radius. Pressure equi-
librium dictates that Rc = Cr r−2/3. The constant of
proportionality Cr is constrained by the observations,
and depends on the number of clumps (see Dijkstra &
Kramer 2012, for more details). We adopt the value
Cr = 0.01. Cn is again a free parameter which we set
to Cn = 10−10 s−1, in order to obtain agreement with
the observations in Steidel et al. (2010). For the outﬂow
velocity proﬁle, we assume that the clumps undergo a ra-
dial acceleration of the form ac(r) = Ar−αv . Under this
assumption, the radial velocity proﬁle is (Steidel et al.
2010)

for αv > 1. We do not take into account values αv ≤ 1
in this work. Furthermore, A is a constant that sets
the velocity at large radius, r → ∞, through v∞ =
min /(αv − 1). Following Steidel et al. (2010) we
2 A r1−αv
set v∞ = 830 km s−1 and αv = 1.4. See Figure 2 in Di-
jkstra & Kramer (2012) and Figure 3 in the Appendix A
for the visualization of these parameters.

We note that this simple model was designed to repro-
duce CGM absorption line data from composite Lyman
Break Galaxy (LBG) spectra. For simplicity, we will use
this model for the environment of LAEs. This may ar-
tiﬁcially enhance the cold gas content of our CGM, and
we will return to this when we discuss our results. Also,
this model assumes spherical symmetry, which does not
represent the true complexity of CGM (e.g., Gauthier &
Chen 2012).

3.2.2. Dijkstra & Kramer (2012) - Decelerated Outﬂow

In the model presented by Dijkstra & Kramer (2012)
the outﬂow velocity decreases beyond a certain radius.
This modiﬁcation allowed Dijkstra & Kramer (2012)
to simultaneously reproduce absorption and emission
around LBGs with a simple scattering model. Their ve-
locity proﬁle was constructed by assuming that the radial
clumps undergo an additional radial deceleration due to
gravity, which dominates beyond some ‘transition’ ra-

(16)
where σ denotes the velocity dispersion and the other pa-
rameters denote the same as in the Steidel et al. model.
We adopt for our model parameters the same values as
in model IV in Dijkstra & Kramer (2012), to whom we
refer the reader for a more detailed discussion about
the model. The reduced outﬂow velocity translates to
a larger clump number density (Eq. 14), and thus en-
hanced covering factor, which in turn aﬀects the radial
dependence of fesc(r) (Eq. 7).

3.2.3. Rahmati et al. (2015) - Fit to EAGLE Simulations

Rahmati et al. (2015) provided a ﬁtting formula for the
area covering fraction of self-shielding gas around sim-
ulated galaxies in the EAGLE simulation. This ‘area
covering factor’, FLLS, denotes the fraction of the to-
tal area 2πbdb at impact parameter b that is covered
by this gas. We can interpret this fraction FLLS as the
probability that a sightline at impact b intersects a self-
shielding cloud, or more accurately, at least one self-
shielding cloud. In other words, we can set FLLS(b) =
P (Nclump ≥ 1, b) (which is the quantity we introduced in
§ 2). The ﬁtting formula in Rahmati et al. (2015) is

(cid:34)

(cid:35)

1 +(cid:0) Lz

x

(cid:1)α + C

1 +(cid:0) Lz

x

(cid:1)3

where x ≡ r/rvir, z denotes redshift and Lz = ABz, in
which A, B, C and α are parameters that depend on the
type of absorber that is considered. We use the param-
eters presented in Table 2 of Rahmati et al. (2015) for
the case of Lyman Limit Systems (LLS) with a velocity
width ∆v = 1500 km/s. We note that the simulations
used by Rahmati et al. (2015) only include a global ion-
izing background, i.e., this ﬁtting formula ignores that
the photoionization rate in close proximity to galaxies is
elevated. The authors argue, however, that this assump-
tion only aﬀects the ﬁtting formula at the 10% level, and
we therefore adopt it as it is.

We now use that Nclump(b) and fc(r) are related to
each other via an Abel-transform (see Eq. 1). We can in-
vert this transformation and obtain fc(r) from Nclump(b)
as

where we obtain (cid:104)Nclump(cid:105) from FLSS = P (Nclump ≥ 1, b)
by inverting Eq. 2 to get

Nclump(b) = − ln (1 − FLLS) .

(19)

We can thus convert the ﬁtting formula from Rahmati
et al. (2015) into fc(r), once we specify the virial radius
rvir. In our model, we adopt for a Lyman alpha emitter,
rvir = 60 pkpc, accounting for the values found for host
dark matter halos of Mh ∼ 1011.5 M(cid:12) (e.g., Lake et al.
2015). Finally, the upper integration limit in Eq. 18 is

r → ∞. However, in practice we use rmax = 250 pkpc,
which corresponds to the maximum distance at which
cold clumps exist in our model, following Steidel et al.
(2010). We have veriﬁed that this consideration does not
aﬀect our main results. Figure 3 in the Appendix shows
the values of the escape fraction and the covering fraction
for the case of this method.

4.

IONIZATION AND SURFACE BRIGHTNESS PROFILES

We present the results for Γ(r) in § 4.1 and SBLyα in
§ 4.2. We restrict our results to distances larger than 10
pkpc since we consider that below this value, the physics
governing the processes within the central galaxy is not
accurately represented by our simple methodology.

4.1. Radial Proﬁle ΓHI(r)

We show in Figure 1 the enhancement of the ionizing
background in the medium surrounding the central LAE
for our three models. The thick yellow solid line shows
the contribution from the central galaxy and the blue
dotted line denotes the contribution from the external
galaxies, where we adopted bLyC(r) = bLAE(r) and con-
sidered non-linear clustering. The green solid line shows
the total photoionization rate, which is simply the sum
of the central and external contributions.

Figure 1 shows that photoionization by the central
source dominates at small distances for all models. At
precisely what radius external galaxies contribute equally
depends on the model. Most notably, external galax-
ies start dominating closer to the central galaxy (at
r ∼ 30 pkpc) in the Rahmati et al. model because the
photoionization rate from the central galaxy lies signiﬁ-
cantly lower than in the other two models. This is be-
cause in this model fc(r) is larger at small r, which causes
fesc to have dropped to a lower value at r = 10 pkpc com-
pared with the other two models. This diﬀerence could
be due to the fact that the ﬁtting formula to the EAGLE
simulations was applied assuming an LAE halo mass of
1011.5 M(cid:12) which is lower than those for LBGs.

In any case,

in all models the enhancement of the
photoionization rate is substantial: a factor >∼10 at
r <∼30 kpc, and goes up to a factor of ∼ 50 ( >∼250)
at r ∼ 10 pkpc for the Rahmati et al. model (Steidel
et al. and Dijkstra & Kramer models). At larger r, we
recover the average value for the ionizing background,
although we ﬁnd the value ΓHI ∼ 4 × 10−13 s−1, which
is slightly smaller than the result obtained by Kuhlen &
Faucher-Gigu`ere (2012), ΓHI ∼ 6 × 10−13 s−1. This dif-
ference arises from the value for the spectral slope, which
we adopted from Becker & Bolton (2013) for our calcu-
lations (see § 3.1.1), but it does not aﬀect our results
signiﬁcantly.

4.2. Radial Proﬁle Surface Brightness SBLyα(b)

Figure 2 shows the Lyα surface brightness proﬁles for
our three models, as given by Eq. 4. For comparison, we

Llu´ıs Mas-Ribas & Mark Dijkstra

show a simpliﬁed view of the data for the highest density
range, 2.5 < δLAE < 5.5, in Matsuda et al. (2012) (their
upper-left panel in Figure 3).

The left panel shows the Steidel et al. model, which
predicts a surface brightness that lies a factor ∼ 1.5 below
the observations at 10 < r < 30 pkpc. This factor varies
slightly at larger distances but the general behaviour is
well reproduced. For this model, the central galaxy dom-
inates the proﬁle up to r ∼ 70 pkpc and the contribution
from external galaxies is only important at larger dis-
tances. However, the strong impact of the central galaxy
requires a very high ionizing photon escape fraction at
distances below 50 pkpc (∼ 30%; Figure 3). The middle
panel of Figure 2 shows the Dijkstra & Kramer model.
The high covering factor, fc, at large distances yields a
proﬁle which is signiﬁcantly above the observed data (a
factor ∼ 3 at r ∼ 65 pkpc). The right panel denotes
the Rahmati et al. model which presents a proﬁle sig-
niﬁcantly below the observed data, a factor ∼3 (∼10) at
r ∼ 10 (r ∼ 65) pkpc. This is because in this model
fc and fesc are much smaller at large r (see Figure 3),
which reduces the surface brightness. We note again that
Rahmati et al. (2015) use a LAE halo mass for their ﬁt-
ting formula, while the outﬂow models are based on LBG
data. The Steidel et al. and Dijkstra & Kramer models
may, therefore, overproduce the surface brightness pro-
ﬁle.
We remind here that our overdensity value is δLAE ∼
1.5 and we are comparing to the range 2.5 < δLAE < 5.5
in Matsuda et al. (2012). In § C in the Appendix we show
the results obtained when simply changing the value for
the LAE bias (setting it to twice its default value) to
obtain an overdensity δLAE ∼ 5.8. Also, we show the
case when setting bLyC(r) = 3 bLAE(r) to test the eﬀects
of a diﬀerent bias for the ionizing sources. However, as
we show, these variations do not aﬀect our main results.

5. DISCUSSION OF THE MODEL

There are several eﬀects that we did not include in
our modeling. First, our analysis assumes that the self-
shielding clumps and ionizing sources are spatially uncor-
related. This assumption is likely unrealistic: for realis-
tic cosmological density ﬁelds there are azimuthal den-
sity ﬂuctuations at ﬁxed galacto-centric radius r, and
we expect both ionizing sources and self-shielding gas to
preferentially reside in higher density regions4. If ioniz-
ing sources and self-shielding gas are spatially correlated,
then this boosts the ﬂuorescent signal: suppose that the
local ionizing ﬂux that is “seen” by a self-shielding cloud
is due to a single nearby source, and that the spatial cor-
relation between ionizing sources and self-shielding gas
reduces the separation d between the nearest ionizing
source and the self-shielding gas by a factor of x (i.e.
d → xd, where x < 1), then this boosts the local ionizing
ﬂux by a factor of x−2. This can be a big eﬀect. We note
however, that by introducing a spatial correlation be-
tween the self-shielding gas and ionizing sources, we force

when both the self-shielding gas and the ionizing sources reside in
ﬁlaments that connect to the central galaxy

contribution of the external galaxies to the boost, except for the case of the Rahmati et al. model. At a distance r ∼ 10 pkpc, the boost
in the ionizing background reaches a factor of ∼50 for the Rahmati et al. case and >∼200 for the other two models.

contribution from the external galaxies. The continuos green line shows the total surface brightness proﬁle and the stars denote a simple
estimation of the data in Matsuda et al. (2012), for their overdensity range 2.5 < δLAE < 5.5. The Steidel et al. and Dijkstra & Kramer
models, where the eﬀect of the central galaxy is very important, are close to the observed data. The latter, however, shows a signal at large
distances, due to the eﬀect of the external galaxies, above the observations. The Rahmati et al. model is well below the data and only the
central galaxy approaches the observations at very small distances.

the observed Lyα emission to closely trace the sources of
ionizing radiation, which likely causes this model to pre-
dict that the non-ionizing UV continuum surface bright-
ness proﬁle should closely trace that of Lyα. This is in
disagreement with the observations in overdense regions
by Steidel et al. (2010); Matsuda et al. (2012) although
Momose et al. (2015) argues that a possible UV signal
from the external galaxies may be within the current de-
tection threshold.

Second, we assumed that Lyα photons are observed
from the location where they were produced. In reality
we may expect Lyα photons to also scatter oﬀ the self-
shielding gas clouds. Scattering redistributes the emis-
sion in the halo, and serves to ﬂatten the predicted sur-
face brightness proﬁle (e.g., Zheng et al. 2011; Hansen
& Peng Oh 2006; Dijkstra & Kramer 2012; Laursen &
Sommer-Larsen 2007).

Third, we have (purposefully) ignored other in-situ

Lyα production mechanisms. Clustering of
ionizing
sources surrounding the central galaxy may also give rise
to clustering of Lyα emitting sources around the cen-
tral galaxy, as the sources of ionizing radiation are also
sources of Lyα photons. We will address the contribu-
tion of satellite galaxies to the extended Lyα emission
in a follow up paper. Our main formalism can be easily
modiﬁed to quantify this contribution.

Fourth, we have ignored the contribution of possible
cooling radiation (Lyα emission produced via collisional
excitation in the neutral gas in response to, e.g., grav-
itational heating). We note that LAEs are thought to
reside in low mass halos (Mh ∼ 1011.5 M(cid:12), e.g., Gawiser
et al. 2007). Predicted Lyα cooling luminosities is a dif-
ﬁcult problem which carries several uncertainties (e.g.,
Dijkstra & Loeb 2009; Faucher-Gigu`ere et al. 2010; Can-
talupo et al. 2012). Predictions for Mh ∼ 1011.5 M(cid:12)
are that LLyα ∼ 1042 erg s−1 (Dijkstra & Loeb 2009;

Lake et al. (2015) reproduced the Lyα surface bright-
ness proﬁle around LAEs naturally in their cosmologi-
cal hydrodynamical simulations through a combination
of cooling and satellite galaxies. Given the above men-
tioned uncertainties related to CGM modeling, it would
be interesting to explore the constraints that this places
on various subgrid prescriptions in the simulations. We
will investigate the contribution from satellites to the
Lyα surface brightness in a parameterized way in the
companion paper. This will complement the work by
Lake et al. (2015).

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Fluorescence refers to the conversion of ionizing pho-
tons into Lyα on the surface of self-shielding gas in the
circum-galactic medium (see § 1). We have computed
whether ﬂuorescence can explain spatially extended Lyα
halos which have been ubiquitously observed around star
forming galaxies.

We have presented a general formalism for calculat-
ing the signal from ﬂuorescence in § 2. This formalism
shows that there are two key model ingredients: (i) the
distribution of self-shielding gas in the circum-galactic
medium, which is quantiﬁed via its (diﬀerential) cov-
ering factor, fc(r), which denotes the number of self-
shielding clumps per unit length; (ii) the local ionizing
radiation ﬁeld, which is quantiﬁed by the photoionization
rate Γ(r). Here, r denotes the galacto-centric distance
from the galaxy. We argued in § 2 that it is not possible
yet to model/simulate these quantities from ﬁrst princi-
ples. It is therefore useful to have an analytic formalism
which allows for an eﬃcient exploration of the parameter
space.

We presented our model for Γ(r) in § 3.1, which ac-
counts for the distance dependent escape fraction of
ionizing ﬂux from the central galaxy. We also con-
sider clustering of ionizing sources around the central
galaxy, by boosting the observationally inferred volumet-
ric production rate of ionizing photons, LyC, by a factor
1 + ξLyC(r), in which ξLyC(r) quantiﬁes the clustering of
ionizing sources around the central galaxy. The nature
of ionzing sources is still unknown, and we assumed that
ξLyC(r) = bLyCbLAEξ(r), in which ξ(r) denotes the non-
linear matter two-point correlation function, bLAE is the
scale dependent bias for LAEs from Ouchi et al. (2010)
and bLyC is an ‘eﬀective’ bias parameter for the ioniz-
ing sources. Our ﬁducial model assumed (for simplicity)
that bLyC = bLAE. We stress that this approach allowed
us to quantify our ignorance of the population of ioniz-
ing sources simply with a single parameter inferred from
studies of the Lyα forest, LyC, and bLyC.

To model fc(r), we have taken three diﬀerent ap-
proaches (see § 3.2). In the ﬁrst, we follow Steidel et al.
(2010) who presented a simple analytic model for fc(r)

which was tuned to reproduce the observed Lyα absorp-
tion from the CGM (obtained from galaxy-galaxy pairs,
see § 3.2.1). In the second, we include the modiﬁcation
by Dijkstra & Kramer (2012) in the form of a deceler-
ated outﬂow. For the third, we adopt a ﬁtting formula
provided by Rahmati et al. (2015) for the area covering
fraction of self-shielding gas around simulated galaxies in
the EAGLE simulation, which we convert into fc(r) via
an inverse Abel-transform (see § 3.2.3).

Our results can be summarized as follows:

• We ﬁnd that the ‘local’

ionizing background is
boosted by a factor ∼ 50 (∼ 200 ) at r = 10 pkpc, where
external clustered sources of ionizing radiation dominate
at r >∼ a few tens (r >∼80 − 100) pkpc for the analytical

model (two clumpy outﬂow models). These diﬀerences
arise from the diﬀerent ionizing photon escape fraction
proﬁles. Smaller values for fesc reduce the contribution
of the central galaxy to the local ionizing radiation ﬁeld.
• Our predicted surface brightness proﬁle for the ac-
celerated clumpy outﬂow model falls a factor of ∼ 1.5− 2
below the observations at r <∼30 pkpc and maintains this
reasonable ﬁt at larger distances. This implies that ﬂu-
orescence may account for 50-60% of the observed ﬂux.
The model with the decelerated outﬂow shows a proﬁle
above the observations at distances r >∼50 pkpc. The
model for the ﬁt to the EAGLE simulations predicts a
surface brightness which is a factor 3-10 below the obser-
vations depending on distance (even considering a highly
clustered population of ionizing sources, bLyC = 3bLAE).
• If ﬂuorescence is to reproduce the observed surface
brightness proﬁles, then this requires that (i ) a signiﬁ-
cant fraction of cold gas, i.e., high covering factor, fc,
must be present at large distances from the center of the
galaxy, which is not obtained in the simulations by Rah-
mati et al. (2015). (ii ) A signiﬁcant escape fraction of
ionizing photons from the central galaxy at small dis-
tances is required for the central galaxy to reproduce the
observations at such distances, and (iii ) the Lyα escape
fraction has to be close to 100%. Otherwise, ﬂuorescence
only accounts for a fraction of the ﬂux in Lyα halos.

There are signiﬁcant uncertainties associated with pre-
dicting the ﬂuorescent Lyα ﬂux in halos surrounding
star forming galaxies, including the unknown nature of
sources of ionizing radiation and the gaseous content of
the CGM. These uncertainties represent key uncertain-
ties in our understanding of galaxy formation and evo-
lution, and in how ionizing (and Lyα) photons escape
from the interstellar media of galaxies. Our calcula-
tions indicate that a contribution from ﬂuorescence to
the total ﬂux in the halo is possible, and more if ionizing
sources and self-shielded gas are correlated. This corre-
lation may help to reduce the contribution to the ﬂuo-
rescent Lyα surface brightness from the central galaxy
at r ∼ 30-70 pkpc.
If the central galaxy was entirely
responsible for the ﬂuorescent signal at these impact pa-
rameters, then this may make it diﬃcult to the environ-
mental dependence of the scale-length of LAHs (and the
non-dependence on MUV of the central galaxy, Steidel

et al. 2011; Matsuda et al. 2012; Momose et al. 2015;
Wisotzki et al. 2015).

In spite of theoretical uncertainties, we expect rapid
progress in this ﬁeld due to anticipated improvements in
the quality of incoming data. As our previous discussion
illustrates, comparing the Lyα and UV continuum sur-
face brightness proﬁles provides useful constraints on the
models. Another very useful observable is the spectrum.
With integral ﬁeld spectrographs such as MUSE5 it is
possible to constrain the spatially resolved spectrum. As
alluded to in § 1, the Lyα spectral line shape contains
information on the kinematics of the scattering medium.
Diﬀerent models for Lyα halos generally predict diﬀer-
ent Lyα spectra, and how they vary with position. Spec-
tra of Lyα created as ﬂuorescence have been predicted
to be narrow, and double peaked (e.g., Gould & Wein-
berg 1996; Cantalupo et al. 2005). Further into the fu-
ture, it would be extremely valuable to use, e.g., JWST6
and/or future ground-based facilities such as E-ELT7 or
GMT8 to search for spatially extended Hα emission. Hα
emission is also produced by ﬂuorescence, but does not
resonantly scatter through neutral hydrogen gas. Fu-
ture joint Hα and Lyα observations of halos would pro-
vide independent constraints on all these halos.
Inde-
pendently, measurements of the polarization of Ly-alpha
would diﬀerentiate between models that invoke scatter-
ing and in-situ production to explain the observed spa-
tially extended Ly-alpha halos (see, e.g., Dijkstra & Loeb
2008; Dijkstra & Kramer 2012). First detections of polar-

ization in spatially extended Lyα emission have recently
been reported (Hayes et al. 2011; Humphrey et al. 2013;
Beck et al. 2016, and also see Prescott et al. (2011) for
a non-detection), which provide independent constraints
on the models.

While none of these measurements are easy, and their
interpretation complicated, it is important to understand
Lyα halos, as they contain information on the gaseous
content of the CGM which complements that of absorp-
tion line studies (e.g., Dijkstra & Kramer 2012; Hennawi
& Prochaska 2013), and on the amplitude of the local ion-
izing radiation ﬁeld. The latter contains information on
quantities like the escape fraction, and on the nature of
ionizing sources in general. Both of these questions repre-
sent some of the main uncertainties in our understanding
of the reionization process, and the physical properties
of the galaxies in general.

PARAMETERS OF THE CLUMPY CIRCUM-GALACTIC MEDIUM

Blue solid lines in Figure 3 show the parameters of the clumpy outﬂow model using the method of Steidel et al.
(2010). The decelerated outﬂow model by Dijkstra & Kramer (2012) (their model IV) is represented by the dot-dashed
green lines where the two models present diﬀerences. Dashed red lines denote the parameters computed from the results
by Rahmati et al. (2015). From left to right and top to bottom, we present the outﬂow velocity vc(r), the radius of
the clumps Rc(r), the area of the clumps σc(r), the number density of clumps nc(r), the covering factor fc(r) and the
escape fraction of ionizing photons fesc(r). All these values are shown with respect to the distance from the central
LAE. We can see that the covering factor for the case of the Rahmati et al. model presents a much steeper decay at
large distances compared to the other two models, although it reaches higher values at small distances. This enhances
the number of clumps close to the centre and reduces it at large distances, which in turn, makes the escape fraction
to suﬀer a very strong decrease within a few tens of kpc. At the maximum distance of our calculations, r = 250 pkpc,
the three methods reach an escape fraction value consistent with other works; The Steidel et al. model yields a value
around 15%, Rahmati et al. around 5% and Dijkstra & Kramer model around 0%. As a reference, the work by Kuhlen
& Faucher-Gigu`ere (2012) ﬁnds a value for the average escape fraction ∼ 3% at z = 3 (Table 1). This value is inferred
from studies of the Lyα forest although large diﬀerences are obtained between works concerning galaxy surveys.

et al. 2007; Kovaˇc et al. 2007; Ouchi et al. 2003, 2010; Guaita et al. 2010). However, for the purpose of our work,
we are interested in the eﬀect due to galaxies at small distances from the central LAE. This cannot be taken into
account using a power law but a proper non-linear clustering treatment is necessary (Iliev et al. 2003; Sheth et al.
2001b). In order to address this more realistic clustering analysis, we make use of the halo model (see, e.g., Zheng
& Guo 2015; Sheth et al. 2001a,b; Smith et al. 2003; Peacock & Dodds 1996, and also Cooray & Sheth (2002) for
an extensive description), which has been largely used in order to reproduce simulations and observations providing
satisfactory results (e.g., Genel et al. 2014; Tal et al. 2013; Sales et al. 2007; Nagai & Kravtsov 2005). We construct an
initial matter power spectrum 9 (see, e.g., Peacock & Dodds 1994, for a review on the calculation of the linear matter
power spectrum) and use the publicly available software hmf 10 to compute the non-linear matter power spectrum at
the redshift of interest. Once we have the power spectrum, we compute the non-linear matter two-point correlation
function as ξ(r) = ξ(r)1h + ξ(r)2h. Finally, we make a simple ﬁt to the data of Ouchi et al. (2010) to obtain the scale
dependent bias of LAEs. Below, we describe this two step procedure in more detail.

Non-linear matter power spectrum and correlation function

We compute the non-linear matter power spectrum using hmf, adopting the default settings except for the redshift
at which the calculation is performed. hmf makes use of the software CAMB (Lewis et al. 2000) to compute the
transfer function, and applies the non-linear corrections to the power spectrum using the HALOFIT (Smith et al.
2003) model, with the updated parameters from Takahashi et al. (2012) (see a detailed description of the method in
https://github.com/steven-murray/hmf). For these calculations, a ΛCDM cosmological model with parameters
ΩΛ = 0.6825, Ωb = 0.049, h = H0/100 = 0.67 and σ8 = 0.8344 is assumed. Left panel in Figure 4 shows the computed
matter power spectrum, where the eﬀect of the non-linear clustering can be observed as a change in the slope between
k ∼ 1 Mpc−1 h and k ∼ 10 Mpc−1 h, thus enhancing the power at small scales, i.e., large k. Once the power spectrum
is computed, the correlation function can be easily obtained using the Fourier transform of the former as

(cid:90)

9 We consider that the dark matter power spectrum is the same
as the matter power spectrum, since the former is the major con-
tributor to the latter.

Fig. 4.— Left panel: The matter power spectrum computed at redshift z = 3.1. Notice the eﬀect of the non-linear clustering between
k ∼ 1 Mpc−1 h and k ∼ 10 Mpc−1 h seen as a change in the slope which produces an enhancement of the power at small scales. Right panel:
The two-point correlation function for dark matter. The 2-halo term dominates at distances larger than r ∼ 1 Mpc h−1 and denotes the
linear clustering term in the correlation. The 1-halo term, denoting the clustering of sources inside the same dark matter halo, dominates
at shorter scales and is the responsible for the enhanced non-linear part of the correlation function.

where k is the wavenumber. The right panel in Figure 4 shows the correlation function for dark matter. The
contribution of the two halo terms is clearly visible: at distances larger than r ∼ 1 Mpch−1 the 2-halo term dominates,
denoting the linear part of the correlation. At shorter distances, the 1-halo term is the responsible for the non-linear
eﬀect that raises the value of the correlation function at those scales.

Bias and LAE correlation function

The ﬁnal step for the calculation of the correlation function of LAEs is to consider the bias between LAEs and dark

matter, which is described as

b2
LAE(r) =

ξLAE(r)
ξDM(r)

.

(B3)

We use the data in Ouchi et al. (2010) who provides the scale dependent bias for LAEs at several redshifts. The
presence of faint sources below the observability threshold or the resolution power makes the observation of clustering
very diﬃcult (Gawiser et al. 2007; Kovaˇc et al. 2007; Ouchi et al. 2010). Due to this, we ﬁnd only three data points at
distances r < 0.4 Mpc h−1 (see lower left panel in Figure 11 in Ouchi et al. 2010). We perform a linear ﬁt to the data
points, in log-log representation, and assume the constant average bias computed by Ouchi et al. (2010), bLAE ∼ 1.5,
for larger distances. We note that the resulting correlation function of LAEs at small scales is very sensitive to the
value of the distance dependence bias. However, an unavailable larger number of data points would be required to
obtain a more reliable ﬁt at such distances. The left panel in Figure 5 shows the bias proﬁle and the data from Ouchi
et al. (2010) and the right panel the resulting LAE correlation function.

EFFECTS OF VARYING THE GALAXY BIAS

We show here the surface brightness proﬁles obtained when allowing small variations of the galaxy bias. We address
two cases: (i ) We consider the eﬀect of a higher LAE overdensity since in our work we have been comparing to the
highest density case from Matsuda et al. (2012). We do this simply by doubling the default value of bLAE. We call
this bias b2x
LAE and its total eﬀect is an increase a factor 4 for the correlation function. We adopt this simple procedure
because we ignore how the clustering proﬁle of a ‘more’ overdense region may change compared to the computed
one. The overdensity value is now δLAE ∼ 5.8, slightly above the maximum value of Matsuda et al. (2012). (ii )
We also consider a departure from the LAE bias when considering the bias of ionizing sources. We assess the value
bLyC(r) = 3 × bLAE(r). Larger values appear to be not physically motivated to us. In this case, the total eﬀect is a
boost a factor 3 for the correlation function, so we expect to ﬁnd very similar results in the two cases.

Figure 6 shows the results for these two calculations. Due to the similar total eﬀect to the correlation function,
there are no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the two methods. More important, there are no signiﬁcant changes when

comparing to our default model parameters. Thus, our main conclusions are not very sensitive to small variations of
the bias parameter but they are strongly dependent on the properties of the medium.

Fig. 6.— Upper panels show the surface brightness proﬁle when accounting for a diﬀerent bias between LAEs and ionizing sources. Lower
panels show the proﬁles when doubling the LAE bias in order to recover higher overdensities. The markers and lines are the same as in
Figure 2. Due to the similar total eﬀect, there are very small diﬀerences between the two cases. There are also small diﬀerences with our
default models which do not change our main results.
