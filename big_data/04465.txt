We analyze the generation process of quantum ﬂuctuations in the quantum Ising model in order to
characterize the entanglement dynamic properties between two distant qubits (spins). Starting from
a strong dominant magnetic ﬁeld where the spin system is in a paramagnetic regime, we switch on a
spin coupling susceptible of creating correlations responsible for the ferromagnetism order. We use
the large coordination expansion method to study two cases: the adiabatic switching that monitors
the evolution of the ground state until it reaches the quantum transition to ordered states; a sudden
sweep (quench) that monitors instead the wave behavior of the quantum ﬂuctuations and simulate
the generation of oﬀ-site correlations.

Introduction: The quantum Ising model has recently
attracted more attention as a mean to test the quantum
property of the D-wave devices. Motivated by recent
experiments [1–3], as well as from a more fundamental
point of view, its study would considerably help to as-
sess the usefullness of a quantum computation especially
the adiabatic computation through annealing [4]. More
speciﬁcally starting from a strong transverse ﬁeld regime,
we switch on the coupling between the spins and monitor
the subsequent quantum evolution especially in the area
close to the transition towards the ferromagnetic state.
One goal is to optimize the coupling dynamics such as to
follow in a closest possible way the ground state of the
D-waves devices.

A sweep through a symmetry-breaking quantum phase
transition is one of the simplest ways to create and am-
plify quantum correlations, that is, entanglement. As the
initial quantum state is symmetric, all directions of sym-
metry breaking are equally likely and seeded by quan-
tum ﬂuctuations. Furthermore, the diverging response
time at the critical point indicates that the many-particle
quantum system is driven far away from equilibrium dur-
ing the sweep. While nearby points will most likely break
the initial symmetry in the same direction, two very dis-
tant points may spontaneously select diﬀerent directions
of symmetry breaking [5]. As a result, the spatial order
parameter distribution after the quench will be inhomo-
geneous—and its spatial correlations are directly deter-
mined by quantum correlations. Open questions in this
context include: How is the order parameter established
and how fast does it spread? What is the role of these
quantum ﬂuctuations? Can they help to understand the
quantum characteristics of a device such as D-wave?

In this letter, we use the large coordination expansion
method to address the dynamics of the quantum Ising
model both in a case of adiabatic switching and sweep-
ing which has been mainly previously used in the con-

text of a lattice Bose gas [6–10]. Since this model is only
exactly solvable in 1D (one dimension) and for nearest
neighbours couplings [11, 14], or for the Bethe lattice us-
ing DMRG [13], or in 2D at thermal equilibrium [12],
we shall provide an alternative able to treat non equilib-
rium dyanmics for higher dimension case together with
the possibility of diﬀerent network connectivity. After
showing the level of accuracy obtained, we determine
the dynamics of the quantum ﬂuctuations after a sud-
den quench to a ﬁxed coupling value and exploit it to
simulate the propagation of correlations inside the qubit
system in particular the ferromagnetic order formation.
Quantum Ising model: We start from the Hamiltonian

[8, 11]:

(1)

It consists of spin (qubits) of component operators ˆSi
µ
(i = x, y, z) at sites µ, ν interacting each other with a
coupling J and plunged in a transverse ﬁeld B. The
matrix Tµν encodes the interactions in a hypercubic lat-
tice of size L with periodic boundary conditions and di-
mension D and is unity only for nearest neighbouring
sites. In that case, the coordination number of the lat-
tice is Z = 2D. This model displays a quantum transi-
tion from the paramagnetic phase (where the transver-
sal magnetic ﬁeld B dominates) to the ferromagnetic or
anti-ferromagnetic phase, which breaks the Z2 spin-ﬂip
symmetry.

Large coordination number expansion: For Z ≫ 1, the
model dynamics is described using the method developed
in [7, 9]. The time-evolution of the density matrix ˆρ of
the total lattice is given by the von Neumann-Liouville

equation i∂t ˆρ = h ˆH, ˆρi. Since the density matrix is

still too complex to be analyzed, we introduce the set of
reduced density matrices ˆρS = Tr6S ˆρ which result from

tracing the Hilbert spaces of all sites except for a set
of few sites S = {µ1, µ2, . . . , µn}. If we keep one site µ
only then the reduced density matrice corresponds to the
linear operator ˆρµ acting on the smaller Hilbert space
of one lattice site µ, if we keep two sites µ, ν then we
deﬁne ˆρµν acting on the Hilbert space of two sites and
so on. These reduced objects simplify the determination
of expected value of operators involving few sites, for
example ˆAµ has the expectation h ˆAµi = Trµ( ˆAµ ˆρµ).
Next we split up those matrices into correlated and
uncorrelated parts. This decomposition is the general-
isation of cumulant expansion used for probability dis-
tribution to density matrices. For two sites, we write
ˆρµν = ˆρcorr
µλ ˆρν +
ˆρcorr
In [7, 9], an exact set of
νλ ˆρµ + ˆρµ ˆρν ˆρλ and so on.
hierarchy equations has been derived for these density
matrices but in order to solve it, for instance, to obtain
ˆρµ, we would need the correlations ˆρcorr
µκ . Similarly, the
equation for the two-point correlations ˆρcorr
µν contains the
three-point correlator ˆρcorr
µνκ and so on. In order to deal
with the dynamics, we demonstrate that if we start in
a separable (i.e., uncorrelated) initial state, the correla-
tions satisfy – at least for a ﬁnite period of time – the
S ∼ 1/Z |S|−1 which means that
following hierarchy ˆρcorr
the higher the number of sites involved in a correlation,
the lower its importance which is controlled by a power
law. More explicitly,

µν + ˆρµ ˆρν , and ˆρµνλ = ˆρcorr

µν ˆρλ + ˆρcorr

µνλ + ˆρcorr

µν = O (1/Z) , ˆρcorr

µνκ = O(cid:0)1/Z 2(cid:1) ,(2)
ˆρµ = O(cid:0)Z 0(cid:1) , ˆρcorr
and so on. Using the spin representation, this statement
can be rewritten using the notation δ ˆAµ = ˆAµ − h ˆAµi
equivalently as:

µν = hδ ˆSi

µi = O(cid:0)Z 0(cid:1) , M ij
κi = O(cid:0)1/Z 2(cid:1) ,

A hierarchy set of equations can be now written for these

In the leading order valid for

netic and ferromagnetic regimes, the spectrum is gapped
but it becomes gapless at the transition. In contrast in
1D, the critical point is at Jc = 2B [11]. Thus the mean-
ﬁeld description valid for large Z displays all essential
qualitative features of phase and excitation spectrum but
nevertheless appears to be a classical description of the
on-site spin vector. Only the next order terms will intro-
duce the quantum ﬂuctuations that form the seeds for
the ferromagnetic order.

Adiabatic switching: We start from the initial condi-
tion Sx
µν = 0 which is an eigenstate of an
Hamiltonian in absence of ferromagnetism at J = 0.
Then we switch J(t) with some particular time depen-
dance. With such uniform initial conditions, all the spins
behave in the same way and the translational invari-
ance imposes correlations depending only on the rela-
tive distance so that we deﬁne y(t) = 2J(t)Si

The ground state solution and quantum transition
point are determined by an adiabatic switching with the
proﬁle J(t) = Jc exp(ǫt) in the interval t =]−∞, 0] with ǫ
inﬁnitesimally small. Noticing that ∂t = ǫJ∂J , the time
parameter is eliminated from the dynamical equations.
The introduction of the scaling M yz
k → ǫ and the scal-
ing unity for all other dynamical variables together with
the elimination of M yz

This independance ensures that the spin system remains
in its ground state by tuning on J as long as it is not
degenerate. Only at the transition point, the excitation
spectrum becomes gapless and the smooth evolution is
not guaranteed. The elimination of M yy
k between the
two last equations leads to a ﬁrst order equation for M zz
that is solved using the variable change y(J). We obtain:

The singularity appearing at y(J) = 1 corresponds to the
quantum phase transition at (Sx
µ)c = (B/2J)c up to the
next order in 1/Z. In that case the correlations become
singular at k = 0. For nearest neighbour interactions, we
obtain the long wavelength scaling ˜M zz

The results are plotted in Fig.1 for large size system
(L → ∞) and go beyond the mean-ﬁeld results. For
D = 1, the solution exists analytically and the next order
correction already converges quite well to the exact value
with a critical point given by:

This value is closer to the exact one (Sx
µ)c = 1/π = 0.32
in [11] and corrects the critical coupling to (J/B)c =
1.12 which is nevertheless still far from the exact value
(J/B)c = 2. For D = 2, the critical value (J/B)c = 1.075
approaches better the exact result (J/B)c = 1.314 ob-
tained through the quantum Monte-Carlo method [12].
For D = 3 the obtained value (J/B)c = 1.042 even closer
to the mean ﬁeld curve cannot be compared but is ex-
pected to be more convergent to the exact results for
larger coordination number. We note that the transition

µ

ηµ = 2(cid:2)1 − Tr(ˆρ2

appears once the spin value reachs the mean ﬁeld value
in the ferromagnetic regime. The spin reduction is a sig-
nature of a global entanglement of a given site with all
the others which can be estimated through the relation
2. It shows that the en-
tanglement increases close to the transition point but de-
creases with the dimension. The Fig.2 displays the grow-
ing extension of the quantum ﬂuctuations range as we
approach the transition at which all sites becomes corre-
lated. Quite generally all the results obtained by adding
the two-sites correlations are an improvement over the
mean-ﬁeld approach and reproduces correctly the phys-
ical properties for the ground state especially for higher
dimensions.

Quench dynamics: Our method will be now used to de-
scribe the dynamical process such as squeezing. We start
from J = 0 and we sweep instantanously the coupling to a
ﬁxed ﬁnal value J. During a time scale much shorter than
the decoherence time, the time evolution of the D-wave
spin system is well described through the quantum Ising
Hamiltonian and can be considered as entirely deter-
minist when starting from the zero temperature ground
state. Therefore any detection of ﬂuctuations resulting

from the quench are purely quantum over this time in-
terval. Staying in the paramagnetic regime (J < Jc),
the transverse spin evolves to reach a steady value lower
than the corresponding one for the ground state but
still close to 1/2. We observe a wave pulse-like gener-
ation of the correlations that propagate just after the
quench. The speed of this propagation is constant and es-
timated twice the group velocity Eq.(6) of the excitation
c = Max (2∂ωk/∂kx) = 2(J/Z)[1 − J(Z − 2)/(BZ)]−1/2.
The factor two corresponds to spontaneous virtual exci-
tations always created in pair and results from the phys-
ical reality that at least two kinks are needed for a spin

odic boundary condition, the signal is reﬂected back as
an echo that aﬀects the transverse spin at Bt = 150 with
a small oscillating burst. The amplitude of the pulse
is modulated by oscillations of frequency estimated to

2Bp1 − J/B/2π. As a result of random waves, the cor-

relations remain short ranged and the total magnetiza-
tion ﬂuctuations M zz = ˜M zz
k=0 along the z axis cannot
develop but instead stays conﬁned to insignicant value
as shown in the second graph of Fig.2. The visible wave-
front can be exploited to test the quantum character of
the interaction between the spin sites. It is a prediction
that has no classical correspondance since it goes beyond
the mean-ﬁeld approach.

Beyond the critical point, the sweep is done in the
ferromagnetic region and quantum correlations develop
over a long range. The frequency of propagation be-
comes imaginary and leads to an exponential growing
with a rate given by γ = 2ωk=0/i = 2Bq2JSx
µ/B − 1 ∼
(J − Jc)1/2. The second graph of Fig.4 shows indeed
a growing rate M zz = M zz
maxγt for J/B = 1.5 where
max = LD/4 corresponds to the maximum possible

value of the total ﬂuctuations, while the spin stabilizes
to a much lower steady state value. Using the long-

(18)

This dominant term displays a ﬁnite speed of propagation
v for the generation of correlations shown in Fig.4. It tells
about the pre-stage dynamics towards a steady ferromag-
netic state. Nevertheless, the analysis is only limited to
a short time scale within the region of the instability of
the growing modes and thus cannot be extended to study
the evolution towards the thermodynamic equilibrium.

In summary: We use the large cooordination number
expansion developed in [7, 9] in order to describe the
nonequilibrium dynamics of the quantum Ising model.
Since this technique is based on the evolution equations
of reduced density matrices,
it can be used eﬃcently
for numerical simulations. The lowest order in 1/Z co-

This method has been applied to calculate the creation
