that are linearly dependent on the scalar (κt) and pseudoscalar (˜κt) top-Higgs coupling and hence
sensitive to the corresponding relative sign. The proposed observables are based on triple product
(TP) correlations that we extract from the expression for the diﬀerential cross section in terms of the
spin vectors of the top and antitop quarks. In order to explore other possibilities, we progressively
modify these TPs, ﬁrst by combining them, and then by replacing the spin vectors by the lepton
momenta or the t and ¯t momenta by their visible parts. We generate Monte Carlo data sets for several
benchmark scenarios, including the Standard Model (κt = 1, ˜κt = 0) and two scenarios with mixed
CP properties (κt = 1, ˜κt = ±1). Assuming an integrated luminosity that is consistent with that
envisioned for the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, and taking into account only statistical
uncertainties, we ﬁnd that the most promising observable can disentangle the “CP-mixed” scenarios
with an eﬀective separation of ∼ 19σ. In the case of observables that do not require the reconstruction
of the t and ¯t momenta, the power of discrimination is up to ∼ 13σ for the same number of events.
We also show that the most promising observables can still disentangle the CP-mixed scenarios when
the number of events is reduced to values consistent with expectations for the Large Hadron Collider
in the near term.

INTRODUCTION

After the discovery of a new boson H by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] collaborations, it has
become of crucial importance to determine its physical properties with the highest possible
precision. The study of the new boson’s couplings to fermions is of great relevance and will
allow us to better understand this particle’s CP-transformation properties, as well as the extent
to which this particle is consistent with the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model (SM)
of particle physics. It is of particular importance to test the coupling of the putative Higgs
boson to the top quark. This coupling governs the main Higgs boson production mechanism
(which proceeds via gluon fusion) and it contributes to the important Higgs boson decay mode
to two photons. It is also involved in the scalar-ﬁeld naturalness problem – giving rise to the
leading dependence on the cut-oﬀ energy scale in the corrections to the Higgs mass – and it
may play an important role in the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking.

Given that the main Higgs boson production process is dominated by a top quark loop and
that the diphoton and digluon decay channels are also mediated by a top loop, these processes
provide constraints on the scalar and pseudoscalar tH couplings, κt and ˜κt [3–6]. However, these
constraints assume that there are no other sources contributing to the corresponding eﬀective
couplings; furthermore, in the case of the diphoton decay channel (which also involves a W
boson loop), it is also assumed that the coupling of the Higgs boson to the W is standard. In this
sense, the constraints derived from measurements of Higgs boson production and decay rates
are indirect constraints. Electric dipole moments can also impose stringent indirect constraints
on ˜κt by assuming that there are no new physics (NP) particles contributing to the loops of the
relevant diagrams and in the case of the EDM of the electron that the electron-Higgs coupling
is that predicted by the SM [3, 7]. In order to probe the tH coupling directly, processes with
smaller cross sections need to be considered.

In contrast to the τ H coupling, which can be studied through the decay H → τ +τ− [8],
the tH coupling can only be tested directly via production processes, since the Higgs boson is
kinematically forbidden from decaying to a t¯t pair. Two types of processes are of particular
interest in this regard – the production of a Higgs boson in association with a t¯t pair and in
association with a single top or antitop. The cross section for associated Higgs production
with a single top (antitop) is smaller than that for production with a t¯t pair, and involves
the interference between a diagram in which the Higgs is radiated from the top (antitop) leg
and one with the Higgs emitted from the intermediate virtual W boson.
Interestingly, this
implies that the contraints on κt and ˜κt derived from tH and ¯tH production are dependent
on the assumption made regarding the coupling of the Higgs boson to the W gauge boson,
κW . Nevertheless, it is important to note that the interference between the above mentioned
diagrams can be exploited to determine the relative sign between κt and κW (see for example
Ref. [9]). Associated Higgs production with a t¯t pair has been studied by several authors,
and various observables sensitive to the couplings κt and ˜κt have been proposed. Examples of
such observables (all of which are CP-even) are the cross section, invariant mass distributions,
the transverse Higgs momentum distribution and the azimuthal angular separation between
the t and ¯t, to name a few [10]. Also, an approach based on weighted moments and optimal
observables has been developed in Ref. [11] to discriminate the hypothesis of a CP-even Higgs
from that of a CP-mixed state within the context of an e+e− as well as a pp collider. Now,
CP-even observables are not sensitive to the relative sign between the scalar and pseudoscalar
couplings κt and ˜κt. Such observables are quadratically dependent on these couplings and thus
only provide an indirect measure of CP violation. In order to be sensitive to the relative sign

2

between κt and ˜κt, CP-odd observables must be considered.

Since the top quark decays before it can hadronize, its spin information is passed on to
the angular distributions of its decay products in such a way that these particles work as spin
analyzers. As is well known, in the case of semileptonic top decay, the charged lepton is the
most powerful in this regard. It is also known that the top quark and antiquark spins are highly
correlated in t¯t production, a feature that is manifested in the double angular distributions of
the decay products of the t and ¯t systems [12]. In the case of t¯tH associated production, the t¯t
spin correlations are also sensitive to the manner in which the top couples to the Higgs boson. In
fact, observables that exploit the diﬀerences in the t¯t spin conﬁgurations were used in Ref. [13]
to improve the discrimination of the t¯tH signal from the dominant irreducible background t¯tb¯b,
which does not involve the Higgs boson.

→ ¯b(cid:96)−¯ν(cid:96)

In this paper, we deﬁne a set of observables that are linearly dependent on κt and ˜κt and are
thus sensitive to the relative sign of these couplings. The proposed observables are based on a
particular set of triple product (TP) correlations that we extract from the expression for the

diﬀerential cross section for pp → t (→ b(cid:96)+ν(cid:96)) ¯t(cid:0)

(cid:1) H, making use of the fact that the t

and ¯t decay products contain spin information and are sensitive to the nature of the tH coupling,
as noted above. By using spinor techniques we relate the top and antitop spin vectors to ﬁnal
state particle momenta and separate the production process from the decay. This allows for the
straightforward identiﬁcation of the contributions that are linearly sensitive to the couplings.
TP correlations in these contributions incorporate the t and ¯t spin vectors; starting with these
TPs, we not only recover the observables given in Refs. [10, 14] but also propose additional
possibilities that have an increased sensitivity to the tH coupling.
In order to establish a
hierarchy in the sensitivity of the TPs under analysis we use simulated events to investigate
three diﬀerent types of observables: asymmetries, mean values and angular distributions. We
note that TP correlations have been used in Ref. [15] in the context of top-quark production
and decay and in Ref. [16] in the framework of anomalous color dipole operators.

In Sec. II we study the theoretical

the diﬀerential cross section. A ﬁrst set of TP correlations is then extracted from this expression.
In Sec. III we probe the sensitivity of these TPs to the tH coupling by using various CP-odd
observables. Subsequent sections are dedicated to the analysis of other CP-odd observables. In
particular, observables based on TPs that do not contain the t and ¯t spin vectors, and in certain
cases incorporate the Higgs momentum, are discussed in Sec. IV; observables that do not involve
the t and ¯t momenta are studied in Sec. V. In Sec. VI we discuss the experimental feasibility
of the most promising observables encountered here. The main conclusions are summarized in
Sec. VII.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK FOR pp → t(→ b(cid:96)+ν(cid:96)) ¯t(→ ¯b(cid:96)− ¯ν(cid:96)) H

At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) t¯tH production proceeds via q ¯q annihilation and gg
fusion processes. The relevant leading-order Feynman diagrams are displayed in Fig. 1, where
the ﬁrst two rows show the q ¯q and gg s-channel diagrams, and the last one depicts the gg
t-channel diagrams. Three more gg-initiated diagrams are obtained by exchanging the gluon
lines in the third row. We describe the tH coupling with the eﬀective Lagrangian

where v = 246 GeV is the SM Higgs vacuum expectation value, and the coeﬃcients κt and ˜κt
parameterize the scalar and pseudoscalar interaction, respectively. The SM case is obtained for
κt = 1 and ˜κt = 0, while the values κt = 0 and ˜κt (cid:54)= 0 parameterize a CP-odd Higgs boson.

Before turning to a discussion of CP-odd observables, it is useful to consider a few theoretical

(cid:1) H, in which the top and antitop both

aspects of the process pp → t (→ b(cid:96)+ν(cid:96)) ¯t(cid:0)

decay semileptonically.
In the following subsections we derive a “factorized” expression for
the gluon fusion contribution to this process and then use this expression to isolate various
mathematical quantities that will be useful as we construct CP-odd observables.

diagrams are obtained by exchanging the gluon lines in the t-channel diagrams.

A. Factorized expression for the scattering cross section

In this subsection we focus on the gg-initiated contributions to t¯tH production, since these
dominate over the the quark-antiquark annihilation contributions. As we shall show below,
assuming the narrow width approximation for the top and antitop quarks, the unpolarized

diﬀerential cross section for gg → t(→ b(cid:96)+ν(cid:96)) ¯t(→ ¯b(cid:96)−¯ν(cid:96)) H may be written in the following

[19].

To derive the above expressions, we begin by considering the schematic representation for the

process gagb → t(→ bi(cid:96)+ν(cid:96)) ¯t(→ ¯bj(cid:96)−¯ν(cid:96)) H that is sketched in Fig. 2. Here a and b denote

the initial-state gluons and i and j refer to the colours of the top and antitop quarks. The
amplitude for this process may be written in the following compact form

The sum over k in the above expression corresponds to the eight gluon-initiated diagrams

respectively. In the last equality in Eq. (6) we have explicitly separated the amplitude into two
sums, with one sum corresponding to the scalar contributions and the other to the pseudoscalar
ones. Taking all of the ﬁnal-state particles to be massless, we can use the spinor techniques

(q2 − m2
of the various particles by the symbols that refer to the names of those particles [21].
Using the expressions deﬁned above for ¯ψt and ψ¯t, we can write the amplitude Mab,ij in a
form that is (in a sense) factorized. As a ﬁrst step, we insert Eqs. (7) and (8) into Eq. (5),

Note that in writing down the above expressions we have adopted the narrow-width approxi-

we have

with nt and n¯t being the four-vectors deﬁned in Eqs. (3) and (4). Thus, φt and φ¯t may be
regarded as describing a top quark with spin vector nt and an antitop quark with spin vector
n¯t, respectively.

As a ﬁnal step toward factorizing the amplitude Mab,ij, we note that the amplitude for a

(cid:113)
top quark with spin vector nt to decay into b(cid:96)+ν(cid:96) is given by
M(t(nt) → b(cid:96)+ν(cid:96)) = ig2PW (t − b)(cid:104)b − |ν(cid:96)+(cid:105)

2 These spinor techniques can also be used for massive ﬁnal-state particles. Given the energy scale involved
in the process in question, however, the assumption of massless ﬁnal-state particles is sensible and greatly
simpliﬁes the derivation of Eq. (2).

3 Since Eq. (9) contains the top quark propagator term Pt(t), for example, |Mab,ij|2 contains the factor ((t2 −
m2
t ) in the narrow-width approximation. Thus, except
for the propagator terms Pt(t) and Pt(¯t), we take the four-vector t appearing in Eqs. (9)-(11) to be on shell,
satisfying t2 = m2

Furthermore, the term inside the square brackets in Eq. (9) is the amplitude for producing a
top quark with spin vector nt, along with an anti-top with spin vector n¯t and a Higgs boson,

M(gagb → ti(nt)¯tj(n¯t)H) = ¯φtAab,ijφ¯t.

Combining Eqs. (14)-(16), we can write Eq. (9) in a form that appears to be factorized,
¯ν(cid:96))M(gagb → ti(nt)¯tj(n¯t)H) .

−
Mab,ij = Pt(t)Pt(¯t)M(t(nt) → b(cid:96)+ν(cid:96))M(¯t(n¯t) → ¯b(cid:96)

(16)

(17)

It is important to note that, even though the above expression has the appearance of being
factorized into production and decay parts, this apparent factorization is a bit misleading. In
particular, the amplitude for t¯tH production contains the top and antitop quark spin four-
vectors nt and n¯t, which depend on ﬁnal-state kinematical quantities [see Eqs. (3) and (4)].
With this qualiﬁcation in mind, we may now use the amplitude in Eq. (17) to determine the
corresponding scattering cross section. After some manipulation of the phase space variables
to take advantage of the presence of the propagator terms, Pt(t) and Pt(¯t), we arrive at the ex-
pression in Eq. (2).4 This expression also has the appearance of being factorized, but qualifying
remarks, similar to those above, apply.

B. Origin of triple product terms

provides signiﬁcant insight into how one might analyze pp → t (→ b(cid:96)+ν(cid:96)) ¯t(cid:0)

The expression derived above for the scattering cross section [see Eq. (2), as well as Eq. (17)]

order to determine the nature of the top-Higgs coupling.
In particular, let us focus on the
production amplitude, M(gagb → ti(nt)¯tj(n¯t)H)), which forms part of the overall amplitude
in Eq. (17). The absolute value squared of the production amplitude is used to determine
dσ(gg → t(nt)¯t(n¯t)H), which in turn forms part of the expression for the “factorized” cross
section in Eq. (2). Summing over colour and gluon indices we have

With the above considerations in mind, it is useful to write a general expression for the
diﬀerential cross section dσ(gg → t(nt)¯t(n¯t)H) in terms of the momenta q = (q1 − q2)/2,
Q = (q1 + q2)/2, t, ¯t, nt and n¯t, where q1,2 denote the momenta of the initial-state gluons. Note
that with this choice, q · Q = 0 and Q2 = −q2 = M 2

the t¯tH system. Fifteen TPs can be constructed from these six four-vectors,5 so that

scalar products and are therefore even under a parity transformation (P). However, the terms
linear in κt˜κt are P-odd due to the presence of the P-odd TPs. Hence, only the functions f1,2
will contribute to the total cross section, whereas the TP terms will be sensitive to the sign
of the anomalous coupling ˜κt. Of the ﬁfteen TPs mentioned above, we will focus on those
that contain both of the spin vectors nt and n¯t, but do not include q. The decision not to
consider q-dependent TPs is motivated by the fact that q cannot be expressed in terms of the
momenta of ﬁnal state particles (as Q can, by virtue of energy-momentum conservation). The
decision to focus on TPs that contain both nt and n¯t is rooted in the fact that the spins of
pair-produced top and antitop quarks are highly correlated at hadron colliders (even though
the quarks themselves are unpolarized). Observables that combine the decay products of the
t and ¯t will be sensitive to this spin correlation [23]. A similar behaviour is expected in t¯tH
production, where it can be shown that single-spin asymmetries vanish [13, 14]. Hence, in
order to construct observables sensitive to the structure of the tH coupling, we will restrict our
attention to those TPs that include information on the decay products of both the top and
anti-top quarks. Only ﬁve of the ﬁfteen TPs in Eq. (20) do not involve the four vector q and,
among these, only three include both nt and n¯t . Thus, we will restrict our attention to the
following TPs

1 ≡ (t, ¯t, nt, n¯t),
2 ≡ (Q, ¯t, nt, n¯t),
3 ≡ (Q, t, nt, n¯t).

(21)

(22)

(23)

Before turning to a consideration of various CP-odd observables, we remark that even though
all of the above discussion took place within the context of gg-initiated production, similar
conclusions are obtained for q ¯q-initiated production. In particular, the deﬁnitions of the spin
vectors in Eqs. (3)-(4) and the general form of dσ introduced in Eq. (20) are valid in both cases.

5 We note that these ﬁfteen TPs are not linearly independent (see the epsilon relations discussed in Ref. [22]).

III. CP-ODD OBSERVABLES

pp → t (→ b(cid:96)+ν(cid:96)) ¯t(cid:0)

→ ¯b(cid:96)−¯ν(cid:96)

In this section we present three types of observables based on the TPs discussed in Sec. II,
namely, asymmetries, angular distributions and mean values. These observables are sensitive
not only to the magnitude of the pseudoscalar coupling ˜κt, but also to its sign. In order to
test the various observables, we have used MadGraph5 aMC@NLO [24] to simulate the process

(cid:1) H at parton level for diﬀerent values of the couplings κt and ˜κt.

In all cases we have generated 105 events and have assumed a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV.6
We have also imposed the following set of cuts: pT of leptons > 10 GeV, |η| of leptons < 2.5, |η|
of b jets < 2.5 and ∆R(cid:96)(cid:96) > 0.4. Note that we have used this somewhat large number of events
(105) in order to determine clearly the extent to which the proposed observables are sensitive
to the anomalous coupling. Section VI contains an analysis of the experimental feasibility of
the more promising observables.

Before continuing on to our analysis, let us make a few comments regarding the values
that we choose for κt and ˜κt. First of all, we note that if the pseudoscalar coupling ˜κt is the
only source of physics beyond the SM, then indirect contraints (based on the signal strength of
gg → H → γγ) disfavour κt < 0 but do not resolve the degeneracy in the sign of ˜κt [10]. On the
other hand, if one assumes that the tensor structure of the Higgs interactions are the same as
those of the SM and if one parameterizes these interactions via one universal Higgs coupling to
vector bosons, κV , and one universal Higgs coupling to fermions, κf , then the measured signal
strengths provided by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations are compatible with the values
predicted by the SM, (namely, κf = 1 and κV = 1). With these facts in mind, we will, for
the most part, set the value of the scalar coupling to its SM value (κt = 1) and will allow the
pseudoscalar coupling to take on various values (including both possible signs). In particular,
we analyze the cases ˜κt = 0,±0.25,±0.5,±0.75,±1. We shall often focus on the scenarios with
κt = 1 and ˜κt = ±1, which we shall refer to as the “CP-mixed” scenarios. In addition, we also
provide some analysis regarding the pure CP-odd case (κt = 0, ˜κt = 1).

A. Asymmetry

The ﬁrst type of CP-odd observable that we will consider is an asymmetry that compares the
number of events for which a given TP is positive to that for which it is negative. Normalizing
to the total number of events, we deﬁne

A() =

N ( > 0) − N ( < 0)
N ( > 0) + N ( < 0)

.

(24)

By construction, A ∈ [−1, +1]. Based on the general expression given in Eq. (20), we expect
the following functional form for the asymmetry,

A() =

Aκt˜κt
t + C ˜κ2
t

Bκ2

,

(25)

6 Note that, since we generate the same number of events in each case, the corresponding integrated luminosities

are diﬀerent, since the cross section depends on the value of ˜κt.

9

which for κt = 1 can be parameterized as

A() =

a˜κt

1 + b˜κ2
t

,

(26)

where the parameter a ≡ A/B determines the sensitivity to the pseudoscalar coupling, whereas
b ≡ C/B quantiﬁes the deviation from linear behaviour.

Table I shows numerical results for the asymmetries associated with three diﬀerent TPs, 1,
2 and 3, taking κt = 1 and ˜κt = 0,±1. The asymmetry A is shown in each case, along with
A/σA, where σA is the corresponding statistical uncertainty. As is evident from the table, the
asymmetries in question provide a clear separation between the SM and the CP-mixed cases,
with typical deviations being of order 10σ. Furthermore, the asymmetries for the SM case are
each statistically consistent with zero, as one would expect. The three asymmetries also allow
one to determine the sign of ˜κt, with the ˜κt = ±1 cases eﬀectively separated by more than
20σ. The sensitivity of the asymmetry is quite similar for the three TPs, as can be seen by
including other values of ˜κt and using the expression in Eq. (26) as a ﬁtting function (see Fig. 3).
Performing such a ﬁt, we obtain (a = −0.057 ± 0.006, b = 0.5 ± 0.2), (a = −0.056 ± 0.006, b =
0.5 ± 0.2) and (a = 0.058 ± 0.006, b = 0.6 ± 0.2) for 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

for the TPs 1 = (t, ¯t, nt, n¯t), 2 = (Q, ¯t, nt, n¯t) and 3 = (Q, t, nt, n¯t). The three scenarios
correspond to the SM (κt = 1 and ˜κt = 0) and the two “CP-mixed” cases (deﬁned by κt = 1
and ˜κt = ±1).

The results shown in Table I and Fig. 3 all assume a pp initial state, which is actually
a combination of events coming from gg and q ¯q initial states. While this combination of
initial states is the appropriate scenario to consider, it is interesting to consider the relative
contributions to the asymmetry coming from the gg and q ¯q initial states. Figure 4 shows three
curves for the “1” case, one for gg-initiated events, one for q ¯q-initiated events, and one for the
usual combination of these events (the “pp” initial state). Interestingly, we see from Fig. 4 that
the asymmetry for this TP is enhanced for gg-initiated production, while it is reduced and of
opposite sign for the q ¯q-initiated events. The asymmetry for the pp case is evidently dominated
by the gg contribution, but is somewhat smaller in magnitude due to the q ¯q contribution.

We have also tested various combinations of the TPs 1,2,3 and have found that the asymmetry

is enhanced for the following combination:

4 = 3 − 2 = (Q, t − ¯t, nt, n¯t).

(27)

Note that in the Q rest frame, 4 = Q0((cid:126)t−(cid:126)¯t )· ((cid:126)nt×(cid:126)n¯t) and the sign of this TP is determined by
the quantity ((cid:126)t−(cid:126)¯t )· ((cid:126)nt × (cid:126)n¯t). The values obtained for the asymmetry associated with this TP

are shown in Table II. By comparing the results in Tables I and II, we see that the capability
of this asymmetry to distinguish between the two CP-mixed scenarios is increased by at least
2.8σ.

Finally, it is worth noting that the asymmetries described in this subsection are not useful for
discriminating between the SM hypothesis (κt = 1, ˜κt = 0) and the pure pseudoscalar hypothesis
(κt = 0, ˜κt = 1). Since the numerators of the asymmetries are linear in both κt and ˜κt, they
are expected to vanish in these cases. However, we will show in the next subsection that there

between these two hyphotheses.

B. Angular Distributions

Given a certain TP, it is possible to deﬁne associated angular distributions that are sensitive
to the pseudoscalar coupling ˜κt. In order to clarify this, let us ﬁrst consider the TP (t, ¯t, nt, n¯t).
This TP can be written as (t + ¯t, ¯t, nt, n¯t), so that in the reference frame deﬁned by (cid:126)t + (cid:126)¯t = 0
and (cid:126)¯t (cid:107) ˆz we have

(t + ¯t, ¯t, nt, n¯t) = Mt¯t |(cid:126)¯t| ((cid:126)nt × (cid:126)n¯t)z = Mt¯t |(cid:126)¯t||(cid:126)nt||(cid:126)n¯t| sin θnt sin θn¯t sin ∆φ(nt, n¯t),

(28)

where Mt¯t is the invariant mass of the t¯t pair, the angles θnt and θn¯t denote the polar angles
of (cid:126)nt and (cid:126)n¯t, respectively, and ∆φ(nt, n¯t) is the angular diﬀerence between the projections of
(cid:126)nt and (cid:126)n¯t onto the plane perpendicular to (cid:126)¯t. If we deﬁne the angle ∆φ(nt, n¯t) to be within
the range [−π, π], we see from Eq. (28) that its sign will determine the sign of the TP. Thus,
the distribution of the number of events with respect to the angle ∆φ(nt, n¯t) is related to the
asymmetry of the TP,

where NT is the total number of events. Moreover, for a certain TP one can derive diﬀerent
angular distributions by considering diﬀerent reference frames, although all of these will satisfy
Eq. (29) (note that A() is Lorentz invariant). Recalling the various TPs considered in Sec. II,
we examine the following angular distributions.

1. 1 = (t, ¯t, nt, n¯t). To probe 1, we construct the distribution dσ/d∆φ1(nt, n¯t) in the
rest frame of t¯t, taking (cid:126)¯t to deﬁne the z-axis. The angle ∆φ1(nt, n¯t) is the angular
diﬀerence between the projection of the spin vectors onto the plane perpendicular to (cid:126)¯t.

2. 2 = (Q, ¯t, nt, n¯t). In this case, we deﬁne the distribution dσ/d∆φ2(nt, n¯t) in the rest
frame of Q, taking (cid:126)¯t to deﬁne the z-axis. The angle ∆φ2(nt, n¯t) is the angular diﬀerence
between the projection of the spin vectors onto the plane perpendicular to (cid:126)¯t.

3. 3 = (Q, t, nt, n¯t). The distribution dσ/d∆φ3(nt, n¯t) is also deﬁned in the rest frame
of Q, but this time taking (cid:126)t to be along the z-axis. The angle ∆φ3(nt, n¯t) is the angular
diﬀerence between the projection of the spin vectors onto the plane perpendicular to (cid:126)t.

Figure 5 shows the normalized distributions obtained for the ﬁrst case listed above. Four
scenarios are considered, corresponding to the SM (κt = 1 and ˜κt = 0), two cases in which
the Higgs boson has mixed CP couplings (κt = 1 and ˜κt = ±1) and a case in which the Higgs
boson is purely CP-odd (κt = 0, ˜κt = 1). Figure 6 shows the analogous distributions for 2.
The distributions corresponding to 3 are similar to those of 2, except that the “shifts” are in
the opposite directions for the two CP-mixed cases. Given the similarities of the plots we do
not include them here.

κt and ˜κt. The error bars indicate the statistical uncertainties.

As can be seen from Figs. 5 and 6, the peaks of the distributions are shifted to the left or
the right of the origin in the CP-mixed cases (κt = 1 and ˜κt = ±1). The magnitude of the shift
appears to be approximately the same in both cases, but is in the opposite direction for κt =
˜κt = 1 compared to κt = −˜κt = 1, thus allowing one to distinguish the sign of the pseudoscalar
coupling. The observed dependence on the sign of ˜κt in these cases is consistent with the fact
that the numerator of A() is linear in ˜κt [see Eq. (26)] and that the quantity N ( < 0)/NT
is related to the angular distribution according to Eq. (29). The angular distributions for the
SM case (κt = 1 and ˜κt = 0) and the pure pseudoscalar case (κt = 0 and ˜κt = 1) are visibly
diﬀerent from each other and from the CP-mixed scenarios. Comparing the SM and purely
pseudoscalar cases, we note that while the angular distributions for the former case exhibit a
minimum at ∆φ1,2(nt, n¯t) = 0, those for the latter case exhibit a peak at this location. Thus,
these two scenarios can be distinguished from each other via these angular distributions. This
is to be contrasted with the situation for the asymmetries A(), which vanish in both cases.

(29) gives A(i) = −4a1 sin δ.
With this ﬁtting function, we obtain phase shifts δ that are approximately between 0.9 and 1
(−1 and −0.9) for κt = −˜κt = 1 (κt = ˜κt = 1), both for 1 and 2.7 However, the quality of the
ﬁts in the four scenarios considered is not very good, particularly for 1. The χ2/d.o.f for the
ﬁts corresponding to 1 are in the range 1.69-3.86, while for 2 they are in the range 0.53-1.16.
The deviation from the functional form proposed in Eq. (30) appears to be due primarily to
the ∆Rll cut that we have imposed. In fact, when this cut is turned oﬀ, the above ranges for
the χ2/d.o.f become 0.75-1.14 and 0.44-1.07 for the 1 and 2 distributions, respectively. Tables
III and IV list the results of the ﬁts obtained when the ∆R(cid:96)(cid:96) cut is relaxed. Figure 7 shows
the corresponding plots for a couple of the scenarios. As is evident from Tables III and IV, the
parameter δ is sensitive not only to the modulus of ˜κt but also to its sign, as would be expected
from Eq. (29). The phase shift δ for the ∆φ1 distribution appears to exhibit a slightly higher
sensitivity than that obtained for the ∆φ2 distribution, although the corresponding numerical
values obtained for the various scenarios are compatible to within their statistical uncertainties.
It is important to stress, however, that the ﬁts for the ∆φ2 distributions always yield smaller
values for the χ2/d.o.f.

In Sec. III A we deﬁned a fourth triple product, 4 = 3−2. We have constructed an angular
distribution related to this TP as well. Speciﬁcally, we have analyzed the ∆φ(nt, n¯t) distribution
in the Q rest frame, taking H to deﬁne the z-axis. We have studied the distributions for various
values of κt and ˜κt and have found that they are not well described by Eq. (30). Instead of
resembling sinusoids that are shifted to the left or right for diﬀerent values of the parameters, the
distributions become distorted in such a way that there is a non-zero asymmetry [see Eq. (29)].
Moreover, the associated asymmetry values are larger than the asymmetries for the other TPs
[see Tables I and II].

for κt = 0, κt = 1, compared to the other cases. We restrict δ to be between ±π/2.

Mean value

We turn now to consider the last type of observable that we will construct from the TPs, the
mean value. As was the case for the observables considered in Secs. III A and III B, the mean
value is sensitive to ˜κt. Given a certain TP, we deﬁne its mean value in the following manner,

(cid:82)  [dσ(pp → b (cid:96)+ν(cid:96) ¯b (cid:96)−¯ν(cid:96)H)/dΦ] dΦ
(cid:82) [dσ(pp → b (cid:96)+ν(cid:96) ¯b (cid:96)−¯ν(cid:96)H)/dΦ] dΦ

(cid:104)(cid:105) =

,

(31)

where Φ is the Lorentz-invariant phase space corresponding to the ﬁnal state b (cid:96)+ν(cid:96) ¯b (cid:96)−¯ν(cid:96)H.
From Eq. (20) we see that only the terms linear in (both) κt and ˜κt will contribute to the mean
value. Thus, we expect this observable to be sensitive not only to the magnitude of κt˜κt, but
also to the relative sign of the couplings.

The results obtained for the TPs 1 = (t, ¯t, nt, n¯t), 2 = (Q, ¯t, nt, n¯t) and 3 = (Q, t, nt, n¯t)
introduced in Sec. II are displayed in Table V. For each TP we list the mean value divided
by the corresponding statistical uncertainty. We see that the three observables are capable of
distinguishing the SM case from both CP-mixed cases. Furthermore, the two CP-mixed cases
are clearly disentangled, since the observables are sensitive to the sign of ˜κt. The observables
(cid:104)2(cid:105) and (cid:104)3(cid:105) appear to be slightly more sensitive than (cid:104)1(cid:105). Also, the mean value for the
combination 4 introduced in Sec. III A is slightly less sensitive than (cid:104)1(cid:105), (cid:104)2(cid:105) and (cid:104)3(cid:105), with
values −4.32, 1.11 and 7.23 for the cases (κt = 1, ˜κt = −1, 0, 1), respectively. As with the
asymmetry, the purely CP-even and purely CP-odd cases cannot be distinguished by the mean
value, since it is linear in both κt and ˜κt (see Eqs. (20) and (31)). Comparing the results in
Table V with the results presented in Sec. III A, we can conclude that the sensitivity to the
anomalous tH coupling is smaller for the mean values of the TPs under consideration than for
the corresponding asymmetries.

IV. CP-ODD OBSERVABLES NOT DEPENDING ON t AND ¯t SPIN VECTORS

So far we have considered TPs involving the momenta t, ¯t and Q and the spin vectors nt and
n¯t [deﬁned in Eqs. (3)-(4)]. Furthermore, we have described the general form of the diﬀerential
cross section in terms of these vectors in Eq. (20). In this section we consider other possibilities
for the choice of the vectors from which the CP-odd observables can be constructed. From the

deﬁnitions in Eqs. (3) and (4), we see that the TPs 1,2,3 can be written as follows,

The above equations express the TPs studied in the last sections as a combination of TPs
involving the momenta t, ¯t, H, (cid:96)+ and (cid:96)−, with coeﬃcients that are functions of phase space
variables. These ﬁve momenta give rise to ﬁve TPs whose sensitivity can also be tested by
means of the observables introduced in Secs. III A-III C. We have found that TPs that do not
include both the lepton and anti-lepton momenta yield negligible sensitivity to the value of ˜κt.
For this reason, we concentrate here on the results obtained for the remaining TPs,8

Tables VI and VII summarize the results for the TPs 5,6,7. We see that 5 gives rise to
asymmetries and mean values that are clearly larger than those obtained for 6 and 7. This is
in contrast to the TPs 1,2,3, for which the asymmetries and mean values are comparable among
the TPs (see Tables I and V). We also note that the asymmetry for 5 is exactly the same as
for 1, as is expected from Eq. (32), since the proportionality factor relating them is positive
deﬁnite. Regarding the mean values, we see by comparing Tables V and VII that the TPs 1,2,3
appear to have a higher sensitivity to the pseudoscalar coupling than do 5,6,7.

It is important to mention that in the t¯t rest frame the sign of the TP 5 is deﬁned through the
angle ∆φ((cid:96)−, (cid:96)+) [see the discussion following Eq. (28)], which is the angular diﬀerence between
the projections of the leptons’ momenta onto the plane perpendicular to (cid:126)¯t. As in Sec. III B, we
can construct an associated angular distribution [see Eq. (29)] that will be sensitive to the sign
of the pseudoscalar coupling. The angular variable ∆φ((cid:96)−, (cid:96)+) is the same as that proposed in
Ref. [14] as a useful CP-odd observable. Moreover, it is shown in Ref. [14] that the corresponding
angular distribution follows the functional form given in Eq. (30). The associated shifts (δ)
obtained for diﬀerent values of ˜κt are expected to be of the same order as those exhibited by
the ∆φ1(nt, n¯t) distribution since the ∆φ((cid:96)−, (cid:96)+) distribution is constrained by the asymmetry
A(5) [via Eq. (29)], which in turn is equal to A(1). Also, we note that A(5) is slightly less
sensitive than A(2), as can be seen from Table I.
In addition to the 5 angular distribution (deﬁned above), one can also deﬁne angular distri-
butions corresponding to 6 and 7. As was the case for the 5 distribution, the corresponding
angles will be deﬁned in terms of the momenta of the leptons instead of in terms of the spin
vectors (as was done in Sec. III B). The angular distributions based on 5-7 have the same
overall behaviour as those derived from 1-3. Using Eq. (30) to ﬁt the distributions and com-
paring to the results obtained for 1-3, we ﬁnd that the phase shifts (δ) are comparable for the
5 angular distribution, but are smaller for the 6 and 7 distributions.

In analogy with the combination of TPs considered in Sec. III, we have found a combination

of the TPs 5,6,7 for which the asymmetry is enhanced compared to those for 5-7,

−
8 = 25 − 6 + 7 = (t + ¯t + H, t − ¯t, (cid:96)+, (cid:96)

).

(38)

We see from Eq. (38) that in the t¯tH rest frame 8 = Mt¯tH((cid:126)t − (cid:126)¯t) · ((cid:126)(cid:96)+× (cid:126)(cid:96)−), where Mt¯tH is the
invariant mass of the t¯tH system. Hence, in the t¯tH rest frame the sign of 8 is determined by
the quantity ((cid:126)t−(cid:126)¯t)·((cid:126)(cid:96)+×(cid:126)(cid:96)−). Comparing Eqs. (27) and (38), and noting that Q = (t+ ¯t+H)/2,
we see that the only relevant diﬀerence between 4 and 8 is that in the latter the spin vectors
nt and n¯t have been replaced by the momenta of the leptons (cid:96)+ and (cid:96)−, respectively. The values
obtained for A(8) are shown in Table VIII. Compared to the TPs 1-3 and 5-7 (see Tables I
and VI), the asymmetry for 8 has a comparable or slightly higher sensitivity for resolving the
CP-mixed cases. Comparing with A(4), however, we see that using the momenta of the leptons
(in 8) instead of the spin vectors produces a decrease in the sensitivity of the asymmetry (see
Tables II and VIII).

20

The mean values of 8 for the scenarios under consideration are comparable with the values
listed in Table VII for 5. We have also studied the associated angular distributions. Speciﬁcally,
we have analyzed the ∆φ((cid:96)+, (cid:96)−) distribution in the t¯tH rest frame, taking H to deﬁne the z-
axis. The distributions obtained for diﬀerent values of κt and ˜κt are not well described by
Eq. (30) (the situation is similar to that encountered for the angular distribution associated
with 4 – see the discussion at the end of Sec. III B.). For diﬀerent values of the parameters,
the distributions become slightly distorted giving rise to a non-zero asymmetry [see Eq. (29)].

V. CP-ODD OBSERVABLES NOT DEPENDING ON t AND ¯t MOMENTA

The observables discussed in the preceding sections all involve the momenta of the top and/or
anti-top quarks and thus require the full reconstruction of the kinematics of the individual t and
¯t systems in order to be measured. Although challenging due to the presence of the two neutrinos
in the ﬁnal state, this can in principle be done by applying a kinematic reconstruction method
such as the neutrino weighting technique [25, 26]. Another possibility is to deﬁne observables
that do not depend on the t and ¯t momenta but instead make use of the momenta of the b
and ¯b quarks to which the t and ¯t decay. In order to construct such observables we will take
as our starting point the most sensitive observables studied in Secs. III and IV, namely those
associated with the TPs 4 and 8, respectively.

Let us ﬁrst consider the TP combination 8, which is deﬁned in Eq. (38). Replacing the
momenta of the t and ¯t quarks by the momenta of the b and ¯b quarks, respectively, we have a
new TP,

−
9 = (b + ¯b + H, b − ¯b, (cid:96)+, (cid:96)

).

(39)

Note that the sign of 9 is determined by the sign of the quantity ((cid:126)b −(cid:126)¯b) · ((cid:126)(cid:96)+× (cid:126)(cid:96)−) in the b¯bH
rest frame. This combination of three vectors (determined in the lab frame instead of the b¯bH
rest frame) is used in Ref. [10] to deﬁne a CP-odd observable that only depends on lab frame
variables. The values of the asymmetry for 9 are listed in Table IX. Comparing Tables VIII
and IX we see that the use of the b and ¯b momenta instead of the t and ¯t momenta leads to
a decrease in the sensitivity of the asymmetry by ∼ 5σ for κt = 1, ˜κt = ±1. Nevertheless, the
observable can still discriminate not only between the two CP-mixed scenarios but also between
these and the SM case.

We proceed in a similar manner with the TP 4. Starting from Eq. (27) and using the

(40)

Since the asymmetry is not changed by the presence of an overall positive deﬁnite multiplicative
factor, let us concentrate instead on the following combination of TPs,

(41)

Instead of replacing t and ¯t directly by b and ¯b, we use the visible contributions, namely b + (cid:96)+
and ¯b + (cid:96)−, respectively. This results in the following deﬁnition

−
10 = ( ˜Q, cb¯b , (cid:96)

where ˜Q ≡ (b+(cid:96)++¯b+(cid:96)−)/2 stands for the visible part of Q, cb¯b = (1−w1) b−(1−w2) ¯b, and the

has been neglected both in w1 and in w2. Note that if we set w1 = w2 = 0, the combination 10
reduces to 9/2 and A(10) becomes equal to A(9). The results obtained for the asymmetry of
10 are given in Table X. By comparing Tables II and X we see again that the sensitivity of the
asymmetry decreases when t and ¯t are not included in the TP. Nevertheless, the combination
10 remains a useful observable for discriminating the CP nature of the Higgs boson, with the
corresponding asymmetry having a sensitivity that is higher than that of 9.

t and (b·(cid:96)+)/m2

Comparing Tables IX and X, we see that the eﬀective separation between the CP-mixed
scenarios is enhanced by about 3σ for A(10) compared to A(9). This improvement in the
asymmetry may be due to two facts. In the ﬁrst place, as was pointed out in Sec. IV when
comparing the TPs 4 and 8, the asymmetry appears to be higher when the spin vectors are
used instead of the lepton momenta. We see from Eqs. (39) and (42) that 10, being obtained
from 4, contains the information on the spin vectors; by way of contrast, 9 depends directly
on the lepton momenta because it is derived from 8. In the second place, in order to obtain
10, we have replaced the top and antitop momenta by their visible parts, while in the case of
9 the bottom and antibottom momenta have been used.

For comparison purposes, we have also used our simulated events to test the lab frame

observable given in Ref. [10]. We have found that this observable appears to be slightly less
sensitive than A(10), giving rise to an eﬀective separation between the CP-mixed scenarios
that is smaller by about 1.4σ.

VI. EXPERIMENTAL FEASIBILITY

In our numerical analyses so far we have used relatively large samples of events (105 events
per sample) in order to clearly distinguish which observables would be most promising. The
number of events expected at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), however,
is smaller than the number of events that we have used in our simulations. In this section we
reexamine the more promising observables, using sample sizes that are more attainable in the
near future.

pp → t (→ b(cid:96)+ν(cid:96)) ¯t(cid:0)

→ ¯b(cid:96)−¯ν(cid:96)

Let us ﬁrst make some estimates regarding the number of signal events expected at the
HL-LHC. In Sec. III we introduced several mild selection cuts. Implementing these cuts, and
assuming that the ﬁnal state leptons could be either electrons or muons, the SM cross section for

(cid:1) H at 14 TeV is ∼ 15.3 fb; thus, the number of events expected

−1 = 4.59 × 104. This number is
within the context of the HL-LHC is ∼ 15.3 fb × 3000 fb
expected to be larger if ˜κt (cid:54)= 0 (assuming κt = 1), since the corresponding cross section is larger
than the SM cross section in this case. Taking into account NLO corrections (to the production
process) via a K factor of approximately 1.2 [27–29], we ﬁnd that the expected number of
events increases to ∼ 5.5 × 104. On the other hand, additional cuts, as well as a reduction in
eﬃciency related to momentum reconstruction, will lead to a decrease in this number. In order
to measure the asymmetry A(4), for example, the t and ¯t momenta need to be reconstructed.
This is challenging, not only due to the presence of two neutrinos in the ﬁnal state (which
escape the detector undetected), but also because the (visible) quarks and charged leptons in
the ﬁnal state need to be correctly associated with the corresponding parent particle (i.e., the
top or antitop quark) [25]. As was already noted in Sec. V, one possibility is to use the neutrino
weighting technique along with associated kinematic constraints [25, 26, 30]. Within the context
of t¯t production this procedure has been used, for instance, to obtain spin correlation [25] and
charge asymmetry [26] measurements. Also, events reconstructed using this technique have
been used in the analysis of angular distributions that are useful for discriminating the signal
from the backgrounds in t¯tH(H → b¯b) at the LHC [30]. In all of these cases the corresponding

23

eﬃciencies in the reconstruction of the momenta are of order 80%.

Given the discussion in the previous paragraph, we have generated sets of 5×104, 1×104 and
5 × 103 events and have recalculated the most sensitive observable, A(4), for each case. The
results are displayed in Table XI, where it can be seen that for 5× 104 events (which is close to
our rough estimate above for the total number of signal events for the HL-LHC), the observable
is still very sensitive to ˜κt. In this case, the CP-mixed scenarios are eﬀectively separated by
19σ. As expected, the sensitivity worsens as the number of events is reduced, but even with
5 × 103 events the eﬀective separation between the CP-mixed scenarios under consideration is
6.5σ.
In Sec. V we deﬁned the TP combination 10, which does not depend directly on the top or
antitop momenta. Although the top and antitop momenta would not need to be reconstructed
to measure A(10), it is still useful to examine this observable for more conservative numbers
of events. Table XII shows the results obtained for 5 × 104 and 1 × 104 events. We see in this
case that even with 1 × 104 events the observable is able to distinguish the CP-mixed cases by
5.6σ.
Finally, it is important to mention that a realistic analysis of the sensitivity of the observables
discussed in this paper requires a study of the impact of the backgrounds, as well as the
hadronization of the quarks in the ﬁnal state and the eﬀects of the detector. If we consider the
dominant decay mode of the Higgs boson, H → b¯b, in order to maximize the cross section of the
process, the signature is given by 4 b-jets, two leptons and missing energy. The main background
arises from the production of t¯t in association with additional jets, with the dominant source
being the production of t¯t + b¯b. In Ref. [31] it is shown that the application of a small set of
cuts results in a large improvement in the signal to background ratio. On the experimental
side, a rigorous treatment of the signal and backgrounds for t¯tH production with H → b¯b is
performed in Ref. [32], using 20.3 fb

−1 of data at √s = 8 TeV.

The results shown in Tables XI and XII reveal that with 5 × 103 and 1 × 104 events, re-
spectively, the observables A(4) and A(10) are still useful for testing ˜κt. Without taking into
account the loss of events that would take place in a realistic experimental analysis, these num-
−1 for the SM and even smaller for
bers of events correspond to a luminosity of ∼ 300 - 600 fb
the CP-mixed cases (due to their larger cross section). This range of luminosities is in principle
achievable in the short term by the LHC. We note that in order to be fully conclusive about

In this paper we have presented a collection of CP-odd observables based on triple product

sign between the scalar (κt) and a potential pseudoscalar (˜κt) top-Higgs coupling. We have
tested the sensitivity of the various triple product correlations by considering three types of
observables: asymmetries, angular distributions, and mean values. Using these observables,
we have examined several benchmark scenarios, focusing in particular on the SM (κt = 1 and
˜κt = 0) and on two “CP-mixed” scenarios (κt = 1 and ˜κt = ±1).
Through the use of spinor techniques we have written the expression for the diﬀerential
cross section of the full process in such a manner that the production and the decay parts are
separated, although connected by the spin vectors of the top and antitop, which are given in
terms of the momenta of the leptons in the ﬁnal state. Moreover, we have identiﬁed the terms
linear in κt and ˜κt as those involving TPs. Among these, we have explored the three that do
not involve the momenta of the incoming quarks/gluons and at the same time incorporate both
spin vectors: 1 ≡ (t, ¯t, nt, n¯t), 2 ≡ (Q, ¯t, nt, n¯t) and 3 ≡ (Q, t, nt, n¯t).
We have found that 1,2,3 allow one to distinguish between the CP-mixed scenarios by more
than ∼ 20σ in the case of asymmetries and ∼ 10σ in the case of mean values when 1 ×
105 simulated events are used. Furthermore, we have shown that the angular distributions
associated with these TPs are also sensitive to the values of κt and ˜κt, exhibiting a phase shift
that varies according to the values taken by these couplings. By exploring TPs that incorporate
the momenta of the Higgs and the leptons instead of the spin vectors, we have concluded that
the observables studied here appear to be more sensitive when the spin vectors are used.

We have also proposed a combination of the TPs, 4 ≡ 3−2, which has a greater sensitivity
than 1-3. With 1 × 105 events, for example, the asymmetry associated with this TP gives
an eﬀective separation between the CP-mixed scenarios that exceeds those coming from 1-3
by at least 2.8σ. When a similar combination is constructed by using the leptons’ momenta

25

instead of the spin vectors (8), the sensitivity in the asymmetry is decreased by 3.1σ compared
to the asymmetry associated with 4 for the same number of events, giving values comparable
with those obtained for the asymmetries of 2 and 3.

Taking into account the challenge of reconstructing the top and antitop momenta due to the
presence of two neutrinos in the ﬁnal state, we have proposed and tested two TP correlations
that avoid this diﬃculty. The ﬁrst one is obtained by replacing the t and ¯t momenta by the b
and ¯b momenta (9), whereas the second includes the visible part of the t and ¯t momenta (10).
We have found that the latter is the more sensitive of the two, leading to a separation between
the CP-mixed cases of ∼ 16σ.
Finally, we have discussed the experimental feasibility of the most sensitive observables
proposed here. We have found that with 5×103 and 1×104 events, respectively, the asymmetries
associated with 4 and 10 are still useful for testing the hypotheses (κt = 1, ˜κt = ±1), giving
rise to separations of order ∼ 6σ. These numbers of events are within reach in the short term
at the LHC, so that these observables could in principle be used to test the relative sign of κt
and ˜κt within that context.
