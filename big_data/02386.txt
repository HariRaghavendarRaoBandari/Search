COFREE OBJECTS IN THE CENTRALIZER AND THE CENTER

CATEGORIES

ADNAN H. ABDULWAHID

Abstract. We study cocompleteness, co-wellpoweredness and generators in the centralizer cat-
egory of an object or morphism in a monoidal category, and the center or the weak center of
a monoidal category. We explicitly give some answers for when colimits, cocompleteness, co-
wellpoweredness and generators in these monoidal categories can be inherited from their base
monidal categories. Most importantly, we investigate cofree objects of comonoids in these monoidal
categories.

1. Introduction

Universal properties are signiﬁcantly considered as one of the most important concepts in mathe-
matics. In deed, they can be thought of as the skeleton of all mathematics concepts. They show
how the objects and the morphisms being uniﬁed and described compatibly relate the whole cate-
gory that they live in. Lots of inﬂuential concepts, such as kernels, cokernels, products, coproducts,
limits, colimits, etc, are essentially involved with universal properties. Perhaps the most impor-
tant notion concerned with them is the concept of adjoint functors. It is simply because “Adjoint
functors arise everywhere” [14, p. (vii)]. Signiﬁcantly, free and cofree objects play a crucial role in
recasting the adjunctions of the forgetful functors in terms of comma categories. For fundamentals
concepts and examples of adjoint functors, we refer the reader to [13], [14], [3], [18], [17], or [16].
For the basic notions of comma categories, we refer to [13] and [14].

Let X be a category. A concrete category over X is a pair (A, U), where A is a category and
U : A → X is a faithful functor [2, p. 61]. Let (A, U) be a concrete category over X. Following [2,
p. 140-143], a free object over X-object X is an A-object A such that there exists a universal arrow
(A, u) over X; that is, u : X → UA such that for every arrow f : X → UB, there exists a unique
morphism f ′ : A → B in A such that Uf ′u = f . We also say that (A, u) is the free object over
X. A concrete category (A, U) over X is said to have free objects provided that for each X-object
X, there exists a universal arrow over X. For example, the category V ectK of vector spaces over a
ﬁeld K has free objects. So do the category Top of topological spaces and the category of Grp of
groups. However, some interesting categories do not have free objects [2, p. 142]).

Dually, co-universal arrows, cofree objects and categories that have cofree objects can be deﬁned.
For the basic concepts of concrete categories, free objects, and cofree objects, we refer the reader
to [12, p. 138-155].

It turns out that a concrete (A, U) over X has (co)free objects if and only if the functor that builds
up (co)free object is a (right) left adjoint to the faithful functor U : A → X.

Although cofree objects are the dual of free objects, the behavior of cofree objects is more com-
plicated than the one of free objects. Furthermore, studying such behavior cannot be obtained by
studying free objects because “the categories considered are not selfdual generally” [12, p. 149].
In this paper, we are interested in investigating cofree objects in the centralizer category of an
object or morphism in a monoidal category and the center or the weak center of a monoidal cate-
gory. For the basic notions of monoidal categories, we refer the reader to [8], [4], and [6, Chapter 6].

More recently, these monoidal categories play a vibrant role in characterizing and identifying many
of interesting categories. For instance, to show that two ﬁnite tensor categories are Morita equiv-
alent, it suﬃces to show that their centers are equivalent as braided tensor categories [8, p. 222].
Another example is to show that a ﬁnite tensor category is group-theoretical, it is suﬃcient to show
its center contains a Lagrangian subcategory [8, p. 313].
In addition, there is a special importance for the center of a ﬁnite tensor category in ﬁnding its
Frobenius-Perron dimension. This comes from the fact that for any ﬁnite tensor category C , we
have F P dim(Z(C )) = F P dim(C )2 [8, p. 168]. We refer to [11] for basics on centralizer categories
while we refer to [21, p. 76] and [8, p. 162] for basics on center categories.

Explicitly, the problem can be formulated as follows. Let C be a monoidal category. Fix an
object X and a morphism h : A → B in C. For any A ∈ {Zh(C), ZX (C), Z(C), Zω (C)}, let
A have a right adjoint?
U

A : CoM on(A ) → A be the forgetful functor corresponding to A . Does U

A reasonably expected machinery for the answer of this question is the dual of Special Adjoint
Functor Theorem (D-SAFT).

We start our inspection by studying the cocompleteness in A , and we give some answers for the
question: under what conditions the colimits of objects in A can be obtained from can be obtained
by the corresponding construction for objects in C. The later implicitly implies that the forgetful
functor U

A is cocontinuous.

Next, we study some conditions that make the co-wellpoweredness of the category A can be in-
herited from C.
We also show how the braiding forces the category A to inherit generators from its base category C.

Finally, we apply the mechanism of D-SAFT for each case. Furthermore, we try to visualize some
interesting consequences by studying the braid category.

From now on let (C, ⊗, I) be a monoidal category and for every X ∈ C, PX , QX the functors deﬁned
by deﬁne the functors

2. Preliminaries

PX = X ⊗ − : C → C, M 7→ X ⊗ M ,
QX = − ⊗ X : C → C, M 7→ M ⊗ X.

Theorem 2.1. [9, p. 148] If A is cocomplete, co-wellpowered and with a generating set, then every
cocontinuous functor from A to a locally small category has a right adjoint.

Deﬁnition 2.2. [19, p. 284] The (left) weak center of C denoted Zω(C) is a category whose objects
are pairs (X, σ) in which X ∈ C and σY : X ⊗ Y → Y ⊗ X natural in Y ∈ C and satisﬁes
σY ⊗Z = (idY ⊗ σZ )(σY ⊗ idX ) for all Y, Z ∈ C and σX,I = idX .
An arrow f : (A, σ) → (B, τ ) in Zω(C) is an arrow f : A → B in C such that, for all X ∈ C, the
following diagram

(2.3)

(A, σ) ⊗ (B, τ ) = (A ⊗ B, δ),

δX : A ⊗ B ⊗ X → X ⊗ A ⊗ B = (σX ⊗ idB )(idA ⊗ τX ).

Deﬁnition 2.3. [21, p. 76] The center of C denoted Z(C) is a category whose objects are pairs
∼
(A, σ) where A ∈ C and σ : A ⊗ −
−→ − ⊗ A is a natural isomorphism such that the following
conditions hold:

(2.4)

σI = idA

(more precisely, σI is the composite of the canonical isomorphisms A ⊗ I ∼= A ∼= I ⊗ A), and

(2.5)

σX⊗Y = (idX ⊗ σY )(σX ⊗ idY )

for all X, Y ∈ C.
An arrow f : (A, σ) → (B, τ ) in Z(C) is an arrow f : A → B in Cc such that, for all X ∈ C, the
following diagram is commutative

The category Z(C) is monoidal with:

(2.7)

where

(2.8)

(A, σ) ⊗ (B, τ ) = (A ⊗ B, δ),

δX = (σX ⊗ idB )(idA ⊗ τX ).

The category Z(C) is braided via

(2.9)

Ψ(A,σ),(B,τ ) = σB : (A, σ) ⊗ (B, τ ) → (B, τ ) ⊗ (A, σ).

Remark 2.4. [21, p. 76] The condition 2.4 on objects of Z(C) is redundant.

Deﬁnition 2.5. [11, p. 46-47] The centralizer ZX(C) of an object X ∈ C is the category whose
objects are pairs (A, α), where A ∈ C and α : A ⊗ X

∼

Remark 2.7. The category Zh(C) was introduced in [11, p. 49] as an essential part of the proof of
lemma 7, and the authors implicitly indicated that it is a monoidal category. For convenience, we
explicitly show that the category Zh(C) is monoidal.

Proposition 2.8. Let h : A → B be an arrow in C. Then the category Zh(C) is monoidal with

Proof.
¯β(h ⊗ idX⊗Y ) = (idX ⊗ β′)(β ⊗ idY )(h ⊗ idX⊗Y )

(deﬁnition of ¯β)
= (idX ⊗ β′)(β ⊗ idY )(h ⊗ idX ⊗ idY )
(⊗ is a bifunctor)
= (idX ⊗ β′)(β(h ⊗ idX ) ⊗ idY )
(naturality of ⊗)
= (idX ⊗ β′)((idX ⊗ h)α ⊗ idY )
(since X ∈ Zh(C))
= (idX ⊗ β′)(idX ⊗ h ⊗ idY )(α ⊗ idY )
(naturality of ⊗)
= (idX ⊗ β′(h ⊗ idY ))(α ⊗ idY )
(naturality of ⊗)
= (idX ⊗ (idY ⊗ h)α′)(α ⊗ idY )
(since Y ∈ Zh(C))
= (idX ⊗ idY ⊗ h)(idX ⊗ α′)(α ⊗ idY )
(naturality of ⊗)
= (idX⊗Y ⊗ h)(idX ⊗ α′)(α ⊗ idY )
(⊗ is a bifunctor)
= (idX⊗Y ⊗ h)¯α
(deﬁnition of ¯α)

Therefore, X ⊗ Y ∈ Zh(C) and thus the category Zh(C) is monoidal.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.9.

(i) For all X ∈ C, we have the following evaluation functor

(2.18)

Z(C)

H

X /

/ ZX(C)

where H
X deﬁned by (A, σ) 7→ (A, σX ). It turns out that if (A, σ) ∈ Z(C), then (A, σX ) ∈
ZX(C), for every X ∈ C. However, to show that an object (A, σ) ∈ Z(C), by Remark 2.4, it
suﬃces to show that (A, σX ) ∈ ZX(C) for every X ∈ C, σ is natural and the condition 2.5
holds as well.

(ii) For all A ∈ C, if (X, α, β) ∈ ZidA

gives rise to an isomorphism given by

(C), then Deﬁnition ref def.4 implies that α = β. This

ZA(C)

- ZidA

(C)

where S

A is deﬁned by (X, α, α) 7→ (X, α−1), and T

A is deﬁned by (X, α) 7→ (X, α−1, α−1).
Thus, we have ZA(C) ∼= ZidA
(C). It turns out that the centralizer category of an object A in
C can be identiﬁed as the centralizer category of the identity morphism of A in C. However,
we will explicitly study the centralizer category of an object due to the discussion of part
(i).

(iii) From Deﬁnitions 2.3, 2.5, there is an embedding Z(C) ֒→ Zω(C).

3. Cocompleteness

Recall that a category C is cocomplete when every functor F : D → C, with D a small category has
a colimit [5]. For the basic notions of cocomplete categories and examples, we refer to [2], [5], or
[20]. A functor is cocontinuous if it preserves all small colimits [9, p. 142].

Proposition 3.1. [1, p. 5] Let CoM on(C) be the category of comonoids of C and U : CoM on(C) →
C the forgetful functor. If C is cocomplete, then CoM on(C) is cocomplete and U is cocontinuous.

Proof.

(cid:3)

Proposition 3.2. Let C be a cocomplete category and h : A → B an arrow in C. If PJ and QJ
are cocontinuous ∀J ∈ {A, B}, then Zh(C) is cocomplete and the forgetful functor U : Zh(C) → C
is cocontinuous. Furthermore, the colimit of objects in Zh(C) can be obtained by the corresponding
construction for objects in C.

Proof. Let D be a small category, and let F : D → Zh(C) be a functor. Since C is a cocomplete
category, the functor U F has a colimit (C, (φD )D∈D ). Since PA is cocontinuous, PA U F has a
colimit (PA(C), (PA(φD ))D∈D ). Equivalently, (A ⊗ C, (idA ⊗ φD )D∈D ) is a colimit of PA U F .
First, we note that the functor F : D → Zh(C) assigns to each object D ∈ D an object
(F D, αFD , βFD ) ∈ Zh(C). We also have F f : (F D, αFD , βFD ) → (F D′, αFD′ , βFD′ ) is an arrow
in Zh(C) for every arrow f : D → D′ in D. Thus, we have the following commutative diagrams:

(3.1)

Therefore, (C ⊗A, ((φD ⊗idA)αFD )D∈D ) is a cocone on PA U F . Since (A⊗C, (idA ⊗φD )D∈D ) is a col-
imit of PA U F , there exits a unique arrow ¯α : A⊗C → C ⊗A in C with ¯α(idA ⊗φD ) = (φD ⊗idA)αFD .

Similarly, since QA is cocontinuous, QA U F has a colimit of (QA(C), (QA(φD ))D∈D ). So (C ⊗
A, (φD ⊗ idA)D∈D ) is a colimit of QA U F .

Correspondingly, we have

(idA ⊗ φD′ )α−1

for any D in D. Hence, (A ⊗ C, ((idA ⊗ φD )α−1
FD )D∈D ) is a cocone on PA U F . Since (C ⊗ A, (φD ⊗
idA)D∈D ) is a colimit of QA U F , there exits a unique arrow ¯α′ : C ⊗ A → A ⊗ C in C with
¯α′(φD ⊗ idA) = (idA ⊗ φD )α−1
FD .

Therefore, we get the following commutative diagram

Next, we show that ¯α is an invertible arrow. From the commutativity of the diagrams 3.2 and 3.3,
we have

¯α(idA ⊗ φD ) = (φD ⊗ idA)αFD ⇔ ¯α(idA ⊗ φD )α−1

FD = (φD ⊗ idA) ⇔ ¯α ¯α′(φD ⊗ idA) = (φD ⊗ idA).

Obviously, (C ⊗ A, (¯α ¯α′(φD ⊗ idA))D∈D ) is a cocone on QA U F . Since (C ⊗ A, (φD ⊗ idA)D∈D ) is a
colimit of QA U F , we have ¯α¯α′ = idC⊗A .

From the commutativity of the diagrams 3.2 and 3.3, we have

(idA ⊗ φD )α−1

FD = ¯α′(φD ⊗ idA) ⇔ (idA ⊗ φD ) = ¯α′(φD ⊗ idA)αFD ⇔ (idA ⊗ φD ) = ¯α′ ¯α(idA ⊗ φD ).

Clearly, (A ⊗ C, (¯α′ ¯α(idA ⊗ φD ))D∈D ) is a cocone on PA U F . Since (A ⊗ C, (idA ⊗ φD )D∈D ) is a
colimit of PA U F , we have ¯α′ ¯α = idA⊗C . Therefore, the arrow ¯α is invertible and ¯α−1 = ¯α′.

(by 3.4)
= ¯β(h ⊗ φD )
(naturality of ⊗)
= ¯β(h ⊗ idC )(idA ⊗ φD )
(naturality of ⊗)

Since (A ⊗ C, (idA ⊗ φD )D∈D ) is a colimit of PA U F , we must have (idC ⊗ h)¯α = ¯β(h ⊗ idC ).
Therefore, (C, ¯α, ¯β) ∈ Zh(C) and φD is an arrow in Zh(C), ∀D ∈ D. Thus, ((C, ¯α, ¯β), (φD )D∈D ) is
a cocone on F . To show that ((C, ¯α, ¯β), (φD )D∈D ) is a colimit of F , let ((C ′, λ, γ), (ψD )D∈D ) be a
cocone on F . Since (C, (φD )D∈D ) is a colimit of U F , there exists a unique morphism g : C → C ′
in C with gφD = ψD for every D ∈ D. The proof is complete whence we show that g is a morphism
in Zh(C). Explicitly, we need to show that the diagrams

Proposition 3.3. Let C be a cocomplete category and X an object in C. If PX , QX are cocontinu-
ous, then ZX(C) is cocomplete and the forgetful functor U : ZX(C) → C is cocontinuous. Moreover,
the colimit of objects in ZX(C) can be obtained by the corresponding construction for objects in C.

Proof. Let D be a small category, and let F : D → ZX(C) be a functor. Since C is a cocomplete
category, U F has a colimit (C, (φD )D∈D ). Since PX is cocontinuous, (PX (C), (PX (φD ))D∈D ) is a
colimit of the functor PX U F . Thus, (X ⊗ C, (idX ⊗ φD )D∈D ) is a colimit of PX U F .
First, we note that the functor F : D → ZX(C) assigns to each object D ∈ D an object
In addition, we have F f : (F D, αFD ) → (F D′, αFD′ ) is an arrow in
(F D, αFD ) ∈ ZX(C).
ZX(C) for every arrow f : D → D′ in D. By 2.10, we have the following commutative diagram

for any D in D. Therefore, (C ⊗ X, ((φD ⊗ idX )α−1
FD )D∈D ) is a cocone on PX U F . Since
(X ⊗ C, (idX ⊗ φD )D∈D ) is a colimit of PX U F , there exits a unique arrow νX : X ⊗ C → C ⊗ X
in C with νX (idX ⊗ φD ) = (φD ⊗ idX )α−1
FD .

Next, we show that µX is an invertible arrow. From the commutativity of the diagrams 3.14 and
3.15, we have

(idX ⊗ φD )αFD = µX (φD ⊗ idX ) ⇔ (idX ⊗ φD ) = µX (φD ⊗ idX )α−1

FD ⇔ (idX ⊗ φD ) = µX νX (idX ⊗ φD ).

Obviously, (X ⊗ C, (µX νX (idX ⊗ φD ))D∈D ) is a cocone on PX U F . Since (X ⊗ C, (idX ⊗ φD )D∈D ) is
a colimit of PX U F , we have µX νX = idX⊗C .

In a similar way, from the commutativity of the diagrams 3.14 and 3.15, we have

νX (idX ⊗ φD ) = (φD ⊗ idX )α−1

FD ⇔ νX (idX ⊗ φD )αFD = (φD ⊗ idX ) ⇔ νX µX (φD ⊗ idX ) = (φD ⊗ idX ).

Clearly, (C ⊗ X, (νX µX (φD ⊗ idX ))D∈D ) is a cocone on QX U F . Since (C ⊗ X, (φD ⊗ idX )D∈D ) is a
colimit of QX U F , we have νX µX = idC⊗X .

Therefore, the arrow µX is invertible and µ−1
arrow in ZX (C), ∀D ∈ D. Hence, ((C, µX ), (φD )D∈D ) is a cocone on F .

X = νX . It follows that (C, µX ) ∈ ZX(C), and φD is an

It remains to show that ((C, µX ), (φD )D∈D ) is a colimit of F , let ((C ′, η), (ψD )D∈D ) be a cocone on
F . Since (C, (φD )D∈D ) is a colimit of U F , there exists a unique morphism g : C → C ′ in C with
gφD = ψD for every D ∈ D.

Clearly, all we need is to show that g is a morphism in ZX(C). Indeed, we need to show that the

the colimit of objects in Z(C) can be obtained by the corresponding construction for objects in C.

Proof. Let D be a small category, and let F : D → Z(C) be a functor.
Since C is a cocomplete category, the functor U F has a colimit (C, (φD )D∈D ). For every X ∈ C,
(PX (C), (PX (φD ))D∈D ) is a colimit of the functor PX U F because PX is cocontinuous.

Corollary 3.6. Let C be a cocomplete category. If PX , QX are cocontinuous ∀X ∈ C, then Zω(C)

4. Co-wellpoweredness

Let E be a class of all epimorphisms of a category A. Then A is called co-wellpowered provided that
no A-object has a proper class of pairwise non-isomorphic quotients [2, p. 125]. In other words, for
every object the quotients form a set [20, p. 92, 95]. We refer the reader to [2] basics on quotients
and co-wellpowered categories.

Proposition 4.1. [1, p. 5] Let CoM on(C) be the category of comonoids of C and U : CoM on(C) →
C be the forgetful functor. If C is co-wellpowered, then so is CoM on(C).

Proof.

(cid:3)

Proposition 4.2. Let C be a co-wellpowered category, and let h : A → B be an arrow in C. If PJ
is cocontinuous ∀J ∈ {A, B}, then Zh(C) is co-wellpowered.

Proof. It is enough to show that if p : (X, α, β) → (Y, α′, β′) and q : (X, α, β) → (Z, α′′, β′′) are in
Zh(C) and equivalent as epimorphisms in C, then they are equivalent (as epimorphisms) in Zh(C).
Let θ : Y → Z be an isomorphism in C for which θp = q. We show that θ is in fact an isomorphism
in Zh(C).
Since p and q are arrows in Zh(C), the following diagrams are commutative.

(since θp = q
= (θ ⊗ idA)(p ⊗ idA)α
(naturality of ⊗)
= (θ ⊗ idA)α′(idA ⊗ p)
(by (4.1))

Since PA is cocontinuous, it preserves epimorphisms [14, p. 72]. Hence, PA(p) = (idA ⊗ p) is an
epimorphism. Thus, α′′(idA ⊗ θ) = (θ ⊗ idA)α′. Similarly, from diagram (4.4), we get α′′(idB ⊗ θ) =
(θ ⊗ idB )α′. Therefore, θ is an isomorphism in Zh(C).

(cid:3)

Proposition 4.3. Let C be a co-wellpowered category and X an object in C. If QX is cocontinuous,
then ZX(C) is co-wellpowered.

Proof. As in Proposition 4.2, it suﬃces to show that if p : (A, α) → (B, β) and q : (A, α) → (B′, β′)
are in ZX(C) and equivalent as epimorphisms in C, then they are equivalent (as epimorphisms) in
ZX(C). Let θ : B → B′ be an isomorphism in C with θp = q. We show that θ is in fact an
isomorphism in ZX (C).
Since p and q are arrows in ZX (C), the following diagrams are commutative.

We have

(since θp = q

(by (4.5))

(since θp = q
= (idX ⊗ θ)(idX ⊗ p)α
(naturality of ⊗)
= (idX ⊗ θ)β(p ⊗ idX )
(by (4.5))

Since QX is cocontinuous, it preserves epimorphisms. Hence, QX(p) = (p ⊗ idX ) is an epimorphism.
Thus, β′(θ ⊗ idX ) = (idX ⊗ θ)β. Therefore, θ is an isomorphism in ZX (C), and the proof is complete.
(cid:3)

Corollary 4.4. Let C be a co-wellpowered category. If QX is cocontinuous, ∀X ∈ C, then Z(C)
and Zω(C) are co-wellpowered.

Proof. This immediately follows from the proof of Proposition 4.3 and Remark 2.9.

5. Generators

Following [14, p. 104] A set G of objects of the category C is said to generate C when to any
parallel pair f, g : X → Y of arrows of C , f 6= g implies that there is an G ∈ G and an arrow
α : G → X in C with f α 6= gα (the term “generates” is well established but poorly chosen; “sepa-
rates” would have been better). For the basic concepts of generating sets, we refer to [14], [2], or [9].

Let C be a monoidal category with a generating set G. Fix an object X and a morphism h : A → B
in C, and let A ∈ {Zh(C), ZX (C), Z(C), Zω (C)}. Our inspection in the previous sections gives rise
to the following question. When can the category A inherit a generating set involved with G from
C?
Under the assumption above, let f, g : Z → W be any parallel pair of morphisms in A with f 6= g.
Since G is a generating set for C, there is an G ∈ G and an arrow α : G → X in C with f α 6= gα.
Now, if we want to show that A has a generating set G whose underlying is G, we need to show
that G ∈ A and the morphism α : G → X is in A . Although, this is not true in general, it

perfectly works when C is a braided. For the basic notions of braided monoidal categories, we refer
to [21], [10] and [15].

It turns out that we have the following theorem.

Theorem 5.1. Let C be a braided monoidal category with a braiding Ψ, and let G be a generating
set for C. Fix an object X and a morphism h in C in C, and let A ∈ {Zh(C), ZX (C), Z(C), Zω (C)}.
The category A has a generating set.

Proof. Consider the following diagram

(5.1)

ZX (C)

Φ2

Z(C)

Φ1

Φ4

C

Zω(C)

Φ3

/ Zh(C)

It is well-known that there is an embedding Φ1 : C ֒→ Z(C) via W 7→ (W, ΨW,− ) [7, p. 264].

Deﬁne the functors

Φ2 : C ֒→ ZX(C), W 7→ (W, ΨW,X ),

Φ3 : C ֒→ Zh(C), W 7→ (W, ΨA,W , ΨB,W ),

Φ4 : C ֒→ Zω(C), W 7→ (W, ΨW,−).

Clearly, Φi is embedding for all i = 2, 3, 4. Therefore, the category C can be viewed as a subcategory
of the category A , A ∈ {Zh(C), ZX (C), Z(C), Zω (C)}.

Now, let f, g : Z → W be any parallel pair of morphisms in A with f 6= g. Since G is a generating set
for C, there is an G ∈ G and an arrow α : G → X in C with f α 6= gα. From the diagram 5.1, we have
G ∈ A , and the morphism α : G → X is in A . Thus, for every A ∈ {Zh(C), ZX (C), Z(C), Zω (C)},
A has a generating set G

A whose underlying is G.

(cid:3)

The following assertion is important in characterizing the cofree objects in CoM on(A ), for all
A ∈ {Zh(C), ZX (C), Z(C), Zω (C)}.

Corollary 5.2. Let C be a braided monoidal category. Fix an object X and a morphism h in C in C,
and let A ∈ {Zh(C), ZX (C), Z(C), Zω (C)}. If the (monoidal) category CoM on(C) has a generating
set, then the category CoM on(A ) has a generating set.

Proof.

6. Investigating Cofree Objects

In this section, we use Theorem 2.1 and Propositions 3.1, 4.1, and the consequences we have to show
A ) has cofree objects, ∀A ∈ {Zh(C), ZX (C), Z(C), Zω (C)}.
that the concrete category (CoM on(A ), U

Theorem 6.1. Let h : A → B be an arrow in C. Let U : CoM on(Zh(C)) → Zh(C) be the
forgetful functor and PJ , QJ cocontinuous ∀J ∈ {A, B}. If C is cocomplete, co-wellpowered and
if CoM on(Zh(C) has a generating set, then U has a right adjoint or, equivalently, the concrete
category (CoM on(Zh(C)), U ) has cofree objects.

Proof. This immediately follows from Propositions 3.1, 3.2, 4.2 and Theorem 2.1.

(cid:3)

Corollary 6.2. Let (C, ⊗, I) be a braided monoidal category and h : A → B an arrow in C. Let
U : CoM on(Zh(C)) → Zh(C) be the forgetful functor and PJ , QJ be cocontinuous ∀J ∈ {A, B}. If
C is cocomplete, co-wellpowered and if CoM on(C) has a generating set, then U has a right adjointor
or equivalently, the concrete category (CoM on(Zh(C)), U ) has cofree objects.

Proof. It is immediate from Theorem 6.1 and Corollary 5.2.

(cid:3)

Similarly, the following are immediate consequences of Propositions 3.1, 3.3, 4.3 and Theorem 2.1.

Theorem 6.3. Let X be an object in C. Let U : CoM on(ZX(C)) → ZX(C) be the forgetful
functor and PX , QX cocontinuous. If C is cocomplete, co-wellpowered and if CoM on(ZX(C)) has a
generating set, then U has a right adjoint, hence, the concrete category (CoM on(ZX(C)), U ) has
cofree objects.

Proof.

(cid:3)

Corollary 6.4. Let (C, ⊗, I) be a braided monoidal category and X an object in C. Let U :
CoM on(ZX(C)) → ZX (C) be the forgetful functor and PX , QX be cocontinuous. If C is cocomplete,
co-wellpowered and if CoM on(C) has a generating set, then U has a right adjoint, hence, the
concrete category (CoM on(ZX(C)), U ) has cofree objects.

Proof. It follows immediately from Theorem 6.3 and Corollary 5.2.

(cid:3)

By Propositions 3.1, 3.5, Corollary 4.4 and Theorem 2.1, we have the following version for the
existence of cofree objects in the monoidal center.

Theorem 6.5. Let U : CoM on(Z(C)) → Z(C) (resp. U ′ : CoM on(Zω(C)) → Z(C)) be the
forgetful functor, and let PX , QX be cocontinuous ∀X ∈ C.
If C is cocomplete, co-wellpowered
and if CoM on(Z(C)) (resp. CoM on(Zω(C))) has a generating set, then U (resp. U ′) has a
right adjoint.
It turns out that, equivalently, the concrete category (CoM on(Z(C)), U ) (resp.
(CoM on(Zω(C)), U ′)) has cofree objects.

Proof.

(cid:3)

Corollary 6.6. Let (C, ⊗, I) be a braided monoidal category and U : CoM on(Z(C)) → Z(C) (resp.
U ′ : CoM on(Zω(C)) → Z(C)) the forgetful functor, and let PX , QX be cocontinuous ∀X ∈ C. If
C is cocomplete, co-wellpowered and if CoM on(C) has a generating set, then U (resp. U ′) has
a right adjoint. It turns out that, equivalently, the concrete category (CoM on(Z(C)), U ) (resp.
(CoM on(Zω(C)), U ′)) has cofree objects.

Proof. The required statement follows from Theorem 6.5 and Corollary 5.2.

COFREE OBJECTS IN THE CENTRALIZER AND THE CENTER CATEGORIES

Example 6.7. Following [21, p. 69-70], the braid category B has as objects the natural numbers
0, 1, 2, ... and as arrows α : n → n the braids on n strings; there are no arrows n → n for m 6= n.

A braid α on n strings can be regarded as an element of the Artin braid group Bn with generators
s1, ..., sn−1 subject to the relations

sisj = sjsi, for j < i − 1

si+1sisi+1 = sisi+1si

Composition of braids is just multiplication in this group, represented diagrammatically by vertical
stacking of braids with the same number of strings.

Tensor product of braids adds the number of strings by placing one braid next to the other longitu-
dinally.

This makes B a strict monoidal category. A braiding cm,n : m + n → n + m is given by crossing
the ﬁrst m strings over the remaining n.

Then B is braided monoidal category. Indeed, it is a balanced monoidal category. To see how the
braid si, the composition of braids, tensor product of braids and the braiding cm,n can be depicted,
we refer the reader to [21, p. 69-70].

Proposition 6.8. The category B is not cocomplete.

Proof. Let D be a small category, and let F : D → B be a functor. By the way of contradiction,
let B be a cocomplete category. It follows that F has a colimit (t, (φD )D∈D ). The deﬁnition of B
implies that F D = t, for all D ∈ D. In particular, we have F is a constant functor, for every
functor F : D → B with D a small category. It is clear that this is a contradiction because we
can always deﬁne a functor from a small category to B. Therefore, the category B is not cocomplete.

(cid:3)

Theorem 6.9. Fix an object X and a morphism h in B. We have

CoM on(A )

∼=

for all A ∈ {Zh(B), ZX(B), Z(B), Zω(B)} ,

where

,

is the category with one object and one (identity) arrow.

Proof. We prove the theorem for A = Z(B), and the rest can be proved similarly. Let ((m, σ), ∆, ǫ)
be a comonoid in Z(B) with a comultiplication ∆ : m → m + m and a counit ǫ : m → 0. The
deﬁnition of the category B implies that m = 0, ∆ = id0 = ǫ, and σ : 0 + − → − + 0 with
σn = idn, for every natural number n. Thus, the category CoM on(Z(B)) consists of one object
((0, σ), id0 , id0 ), where σ : 0 + − → − + 0 is the trivial natural isomorphism with with σn = idn , for
every natural number n.

A : CoM on(A ) →
Theorem 6.10. Fix an object X and a morphism h in B. The forgetful functor U
A has a right adjoint ∀A ∈ {Zh(B), ZX(B), Z(B), Zω(B)}, and thus, equivalently, the concrete cat-
egory (CoM on(A ), U

A ) has cofree objects.

Proof. It follows immediately from Theorem 6.9 that CoM on(A ) is cocomplete, co-wellpowered,
and with a generating set. Thus, using Theorem 2.1 completes the proof.

Remark 6.11. Fix an object X and a morphism h in B. It follows from Theorem 6.10 that the
A : A → CoM on(A ) ∀A ∈
forgetful functor U
{Zh(B), ZX (B), Z(B), Zω(B)}. Theorem 6.10, furthermore, implies that V
A : A → CoM on(A ) is a
constant functor ∀A ∈ {Zh(B), ZX (B), Z(B), Zω(B)}. Therefore, ∀A ∈ {Zh(B), ZX (B), Z(B), Zω(B)},
all the objects in the category A have the same corresponding cofree object.

A : CoM on(A ) → A has a right adjoint V

(cid:3)

Example 6.12. Following [21, p. 74-75], the monoidal category ˜B is deﬁned similarly to B, except
that the arrows are braids on ribbons (instead of on strings) and it is permissible to twist the ribbons
through full 2π turns.

The homsets ˜B(n, n) = ˜Bn are groups under composition. A presentation of this group ˜Bn is given
by generators s1, ..., sn where s1, ..., sn−1 satisfy the relations as for Bn. These are depicted by
thickened versions of the diagrams in Example 6.7, along with the extra relation

sn−1snsn−1sn = snsn−1snsn−1

Composition in ˜B is vertical stacking of diagrams, and tensor product for ˜B is horizontal placement
of diagrams, much as for B. The braiding cm,n : m + n → n + m for ˜B is obtained by placing the
ﬁrst m ribbons over the remaining n without introducing any twists. Then ˜B is a braided monoidal
category. Indeed, it is a balanced monoidal category. To see how sn and the braiding cm,n can be
visualized, we refer the reader to [21, p. 74-75].

The identiﬁcation of ˜B is similar to that of B, and Proposition 6.8 and Theorems 6.9, 6.10 imply
the following consequences.
Proposition 6.13. Fix an object X and a morphism h in ˜B. For all A ∈ {Zh( ˜B), ZX ( ˜B), Z( ˜B), Zω( ˜B)},
let U

A : CoM on(A ) → A be the forgetful functor. We have the following:
(i) The category ˜B is not cocomplete.

(ii)

CoM on(A )

(iii) For all A ∈ {Zh( ˜B), ZX ( ˜B), Z( ˜B), Zω( ˜B)}, the functor U

A has a right adjoint, and thus,

equivalently, the concrete category (CoM on(A ), U

A ) has cofree objects.
