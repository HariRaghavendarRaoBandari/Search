ABSTRACT

Many real-world complex systems across natural, social, and economical domains consist of manifold layers to form multiplex
networks. The multiple network layers give rise to nonlinear effect for the emergent dynamics of systems. Especially, weak
layers that can potentially play signiﬁcant role in amplifying the vulnerability of multiplex networks might be shadowed in the
aggregated single-layer network framework which indiscriminately accumulates all layers. Here we present a simple model of
cascading failure on multiplex networks of weight-heterogeneous layers. By simulating the model on the multiplex network of
international trades, we found that the multiplex model produces more catastrophic cascading failures which are the result
of emergent collective effect of coupling layers, rather than the simple sum thereof. Therefore risks can be systematically
underestimated in single-layer network analyses because the impact of weak layers can be overlooked. We anticipate that our
simple theoretical study can contribute to further investigation and design of optimal risk-averse real-world complex systems.

Introduction
No systems in nature and society are in complete isolation. Rather, they are constantly interacting with others through a myriad
of different interactions. For instance, in human society, individuals interact one another through several social relationships
such as friendship, kinship, co-workership, etc. Such “multiplexity” in complex systems1–4 induces nontrivial emergent
behaviors such as layer-wise structural features,5–7 catastrophic cascades of failure,8–11 facilitated social cascades12–14 and
modulated information spreading,15, 16 to name but a few.

Global economy can also be best viewed as the multiplex system, in which each country is connected to other countries
through various politico-ﬁnancial channels such as commodity trading, capital trading, political alliance, and the like.17
The degree of multiplexity in global economy has become more important than ever, owing to the recent fast development
of information and communication technology which enabled unprecedentedly more active and sophisticated interaction
channels between different economic sectors, making the whole system increasingly more interwoven and interdependent. This
increasing connectivity and interdependence within the global economic system has elevated the possibility of systemic risks
that could not be accounted for by orthodox economic theory, as many have argued recently.18–22 Subprime mortgage crisis in
2008 and the european sovereign-debt crisis in late 2009 would be prime recent manifestation of such risks. In order to better
estimate, understand, and predict the risk of such large-scale economic turmoils, therefore, new perspective on crisis modeling
based on multiplex networks beyond the single-network framework is called for.23–32

Cascading failures on networks is one of the most actively studied classes of problems in network dynamics,33–36 which
can serve as the theoretical platform for crisis modeling.37 In this paper, we study a simplistic crisis spreading model on the
multiplex network of international trade. In so doing, our objective is twofold. Our ﬁrst and foremost objective is to better
understand the role of multiplexity in cascading failure dynamics on multiplex networks in general. Secondly, through the
study of multiplex crisis spreading model we shall hope to draw some insight in the ﬁnancial context at the theoretical level.
To this end, we construct the multiplex network of two layers of international trade, based on the empirical trading relations
among countries in the primary and the secondary industry sector, respectively (Fig. 1), on which the multiplex crisis-spreading
model is simulated (see Model and Methods sections for details). The rationale underlying this construction is that these two
layers constitute an interdependent relationship in the sense that the proper operation of the primary industry sector is bound to
the stable demand from the secondary industry sector, the proper operation of which in turn relies on the stable supply of raw
materials from the primary sector. A crucial consequence of such interdependency in multiplex system is that the failure of a
node in one layer also causes the failure of that node in the other layer, which could dramatically amplify the entangled cascade
of failure.8, 12

From theoretical perspective of multiplex network dynamics, another key property of multiplex trade network is that the

industry sector (red arrows) and the second layer represents the secondary industry sector (blue arrows). Only trading relations

two layers have signiﬁcantly different density and weight of connections in the two layers: The secondary industry sector layer
is similarly dense (1.06 times mean degree in terms of the number of trading partner countries) yet carries ≈ 3.8 times larger
weight (in terms of the monetary volume of trades) than the primary industry sector. Therefore, when one were to aggregate the
two layers in the hope of simplifying the dynamics, one tends to end up with wrong prediction by neglecting the cooperative
multiplex coupling between the two layers to which the weak layer can exert just as substantial an effect. To address this issue
more concretely, we assess individual country’s potential impact on the avalanche dynamics with a simpliﬁed cascading failure
model on the multiplex trade network and argue for the strength of weak layer by comparing the multiplex dynamic outcome
with the corresponding single-layer counterpart. We ﬁnd that the multiplex coupling facilitate the cascades of failure to a
great extent compared with equivalent dynamics on the aggregated single-layer network. The emergent multiplex dynamics is
further shown to be more than sum of individual layer dynamics. It will ﬁnally be shown that the primary industry layer can
play as instrumental role as the secondary industry layer in driving the multiplexity-induced cascades, despite its signiﬁcantly
smaller weight. All these indicate that the risk of cascades could be considerably underestimated in the aggregated single-layer
framework, even when the link weight is largely dominated by a single layer, thus shadowing the potential elevated risk of
catastrophic failure.

Multiplex cascading failure model
In this section we introduce the multiplex cascading failure model on the weighted and directed network with heterogeneous
nodal capacity. The present model is a multiplex generalization of the single-layer cascading failure model studied in ref. 37. In
the multiplex cascading failure model, each node engages in two different layers of links and the two layers are considered
interdependent each other. Due to the interdependence, a node’s failure in one layer implies its failure in the other layer. A brief
description of the dynamic rule of the model is as follows (for a full algorithmic presentation, see Methods section). When a
node i fails, it decreases the weights of its all outgoing links weights by the fraction f1 and f2 in layer 1 and 2 respectively, such
that

The same weight reduction is applied to all its incoming links, W (1)

where F is the set of failed nodes. If the failure condition is met, the node k fails and the cascade of failure proceeds and the
dynamics proceeds in discrete steps by following the parallel update. The cascade of failure initiated by small fraction of seed
nodes is terminated at the step at which there are no more newly-failed nodes. The total number of failed nodes in the cascade
process is called the avalanche size A, which is the main observable for this model. The failure tolerance parameters t1 and
t2 are also independent free parameters of the model with the range of t1,t2 ∈ [0,1]. But the two parameter sets { f1, f2} and
{t1,t2} are not independent; the dynamics depends only on their fractional combination, φ1 = f1/t1 and φ2 = f2/t2,37 thus
leaving only two independent free parameters {φ1,φ2} in the model, and the failure condition becomes

Multiplex international trade network
The international trade network is one of the representative examples of weighted and directed networks, which also has
multirelational property.38 Thus it is an ideal testbed on which the multiplex cascading failure model can be simulated to
investigate the effects of multiplexity and the disparity in layer strengths. The international trade data39 allows the link
categorization in terms of commodity classes up to nearly a hundred of ‘trade layers,’ as described in ref. 38. Here we take an
alternative, intermediate or mesoscopic level classiﬁcation of primary and secondary industry sectors, under the rationale of
layer interdependency as posited in the Introduction. In this setting of multiplex international trade network, the nodes denote
individual countries and the link weights W (a)
ji ) denote the trade volume that a country i exports (imports) to (from) a
country j in the a-ary industry sector layer. An important property of this international trade network is that the total weight
(trade volume) of primary industry layer (≈1.3 Trillion US dollars) is much smaller than that of secondary industry layer (≈4.9
Trillion US dollars). Consequently, if one were to aggregate the two layers into one, the role of primary industry layer would
likely be obscured and underestimated.

For the nodal capacity Ci to tolerate the impact of link weight change induced by neighboring countries’ failure, a natural
quantity to use would be the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) being a proxy for the country’s economic potential capacity.40

Results
Multiplex coupling facilitates the cascading failure dynamics
The main observable of the cascading failure model is the avalanche size Ai which is deﬁned as the total number of failed nodes
starting from the initial failure of the single country i.37 It can be considered as a measure of potential impact of the country i

control parameters, φ1 and φ2. For the ﬁxed parameter φ2 = 10, the average avalanche size (c) and the number of nonzero

on the cascading failure dynamics. We compute the avalanche sizes {Ai} for all the countries for the given range of control
parameters φ1 and φ2 for the primary and secondary layer, respectively. As economic crises accompany a few percentage of
GDP falls, we choose the reasonable parameter range of 0 ≤ φ1 ≤ 30 and 0 ≤ φ2 ≤ 20. In 2009 eurozone crisis, for example,
there were signiﬁcant GDP decrement of some countries from 5 to 15%.41 From it, we derive the average avalanche size over
all epicentric countries (cid:104)A(cid:105) = 1
N ∑i Ai, where N = 160 is the total number of countries in the data, for the multiplex model
(denoted as (cid:104)A(cid:105)m) and for the aggregated single-network model using the effective parameter φeff (denoted as (cid:104)A(cid:105)s). We also
compute the number of epicentric countries that can induce additional failure of other countries (that is, Ai > 1), to be denoted
as Nm for the multiplex and Ns for the single-network case. These quantities can be interpreted as the likelihood (N) and the
expected extent ((cid:104)A(cid:105)) of cascading failures from a random epicenter.

By using these two quantities we address the amplifying impact of multiplex coupling in the cascading failure dynamics.

Speciﬁcally, we quantify it by taking the ratios,

ΓA = (cid:104)A(cid:105)m/(cid:104)A(cid:105)s

and ΓN = Nm/Ns,

(7)

respectively. As shown in Figs. 1a,b, these ratios are obtained to be consistently greater than unity, indicating the generic
amplifying effect of multiplex coupling. Not only the ratios but we also observe the systematic persistence of the absolute gap

Forty countries are found to have ΓA > 1 (Fig. 2e). Top-rankers in the avalanche size ratio are overrepresented with
industrialized countries in east asian region, such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and
Thailand. G8 countries (England, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, USA, Russia, except Canada) make the appearance in the
list, as well as China. Holland and Saudi Arabia make the third and ﬁfth place, reﬂecting their role in entrepˆot trading and oil
trading, respectively.

Multiplex dynamics is more than sum of individual-layer dynamics
We verify that the facilitation of avalanche dynamics is cooperative effect of multiplexity rather than simple additive effect
(cid:83)
of dynamics in isolation. To see this, suppose a hypothetical situation that a country i induces failures of its neighbors
j and k in layer 1, and l and m in layer 2 respectively. Then the simple union of collapsed countries from a country i is
collapsed,i = { j,k,l,m} with size 4. We call this as the union avalanche size of the country i, Au,i, and this measures the simple
additive effects of each isolated dynamics. Similarly to the previous part, we take the ratio of the average avalanche size of
multiplex model (cid:104)A(cid:105)m and the average union avalanche size (cid:104)A(cid:105)u, to be called the excess avalanche ratio,

ΓE = (cid:104)A(cid:105)m/(cid:104)A(cid:105)u,

(8)

which gives the measure of more-than-additive, cooperative effect from multiplexity.
As shown in Fig. 3, the cooperative effect is prevalent. The excess ratio exceeds unity in wide parameter range (Fig. 3a) and
the gap between (cid:104)A(cid:105)m and (cid:104)A(cid:105)u broadens with φ (Fig. 3b). Similar ampliﬁcation of global cascades from cooperative effect
between multiplex layers was also obtained in threshold cascade dynamics.12–14 Saudi Arabia stands as the signiﬁcant top-rank
country for excess avalanche ratio, followed by Italy, South Korea, Belgium, Thailand, and so forth (Fig. 3c). Expectedly, all
the nineteen countries with ΓE > 1 are also found in the list of countries with ΓA > 1 in Fig. 2e.

Strength of weak layers: Role of the primary industry sector
The multiplexity-induced cascade relations (that is, the failure in multiplex dynamics of a country that did not fail in aggregated
single-layer dynamics) constitute complex web structure (Fig. 4a). Yet the net effect of multiplex coupling is not a simple
overall ampliﬁcation of cascades. Rather, its effect is heterogeneous across the countries, and thus can lead to the active

while Russia, Australia, and South Africa undergo biggest drops in their ranking.

What can account for such an ampliﬁcation effect of the multiplex dynamics compared to the single-layer dynamics? Given
the disproportionate difference in link weights (trading volume), might most effect be attributed to the secondary industry
layer? The key observation of this study suggests that it is not necessarily so. In fact, signiﬁcant part of the difference in Am and
As must be attributed to the role of primary industry layer. To see this, we show in Fig. 4c the piecharts showing the proportions
of cascades due to the primary and secondary industry layers for each country, scatterplotted in (As, Am) plane. It shows a good
share of cascades proceed through the primary industry layer, much larger than expected from the link weights (which is about
20%). This shows that the role of the primary industry layer, despite being weak, is not negligible, which would nevertheless be
overlooked when the two layers were to get aggregated.

To further quantify the role of each layer in emergent multiplex dynamics, we classiﬁed all the countries into three classes
by examining their ΓA proﬁles (Fig. 5). The ﬁrst class is called layer-1 driven and displays ΓA > 1 if φ1 exceeds the threshold,
without depending much on φ2 (Fig. 5a). Ten countries are assigned to this class and typical examples are Saudi Arabia and
Israel. On the contrary, the second class displays ΓA > 1 if φ2 exceeds the threshold without much depending on φ1 (Fig. 5b),
so it called layer-2 driven. Nine countries are assigned to this and Indonesia and Hong Kong are representative examples.
The rest of countries comprise the third class displaying mixed behavior, depending both on φ1 and φ2. This classiﬁcation

is not intended to be rigorous but instructive to show that the two layers, despite their signiﬁcant difference in weights, play
comparable role in driving emergent multiplex dynamics.

Discussion
In this paper we have investigated the problem of cascading failures on multiplex networks, with particular emphasis on the
role of weak layers with small weights. A simple theoretical model is simulated on the duplex international trade network with
two functionally interdependent layers representing different industry sector: the primary and secondary industry layers. The
multiplex coupling is found to greatly facilitate the cascades of failure, leading to larger and more frequent avalanche compared
with that for equivalent dynamics on the aggregated single-layer network. The emergent multiplex dynamics is also more
than sum of individual layer dynamics. In driving such multiplexity-induced cascades the primary industry layer can play
as instrumental role as the secondary industry layer, despite its smaller weight by the factor almost four. All these indicate
that the risk of cascades could be severely and systematically underestimated when we consider the system in the aggregated
single-layer framework, even when the link weight is dominated by a particular layer, thus shadowing the risk of catastrophic
failure.

Real-world complex systems, including the global economic and ﬁnancial system, is becoming ever more complex. New
layers of interaction (new ﬁnancial instruments or new social interaction medium, say) are invented continuously and get
entangled with the existing systems, which itself are interacting and interdependent one another. Such increasing complexity
and interdependency can potentially amplify the risk as is exempliﬁed in this work. And this can be done even when the
new layers start very weakly, as long as the system bears collateral nature in it. Although the model studied in this work is
highly simpliﬁed and applied only to one example system of international trade network, the message is expected to be generic.
Features speciﬁc to the international trade network include the ﬁnite size (about two hundreds nodes), network correlations42–47
(manifest as economic bloc and geopolitical clustering), and ﬂuctuations (year-to-year ﬂuctuation of trades and GDPs). Another

interdependent and thus collateral-damaged. It is an obvious oversimpliﬁcation, yet can be remedied easily by a more detailed
modeling of the dynamic rules of the multiplex model.12–14, 31 We hope that our study would help build better understanding
and controlling of cascading failures on multiplex networks towards the more safe and optimal complex systems.48–50

Data
The multiplex world trade is based on the real trading relations data between countries and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data.
The GDP is the representative indicator of each countries’ economic development. We use them as each countries’ capacity of
bearing from shocks and economic crises. The GDP data was obtained from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) World
Economic Outlook Databases (WEO).40 From this database we use the GDP value of each countries in the year of 2000.

The relations between countries are given by the commodity-speciﬁc trading data, which is obtained from the UN
COMTRADE database.39 This dataset provides trading relations among each countries for both exports and imports with
speciﬁc commodities in every year from 1962. It provides several commodity classiﬁcation and we used the SITC Rev.239
among them. Here we also use the data of the year of 2000.

Using this classiﬁcation, we construct the multiplex global trade network with two layers. The ﬁrst layer (layer 1) is consist
of the primary industry products with classiﬁcation numbers 0 through 4. The secondary industry produces with classiﬁcation
numbers from 5 through 8 compose the second layer (layer 2). The classiﬁcation number 9 commodities are not classiﬁed
elsewhere in the SITC Rev.2 and can be ignored since their proportion to the total trade volume is negligible. Only countries
which are included both the GDP and trade data are considered so that there are 160 countries in the multiplex global trade
network. For comparing with the effect of multiplex network, we also constructed the single-layer version of global trade
network by aggregating two layers.
