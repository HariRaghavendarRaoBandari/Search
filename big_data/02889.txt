Abstract.

We review the imaginary time path integral approach to the quench dynamics
of conformal ﬁeld theories. We show how this technique can be applied to the
determination of the time dependence of correlation functions and entanglement
entropy for both global and local quenches. We also brieﬂy review other quench
protocols. We carefully discuss the limits of applicability of these results to realistic
models of condensed matter and cold atoms.

1. Introduction

The non-equilibrium quench dynamics of isolated quantum systems is a subject under
intense theoretical investigation, triggered in part by recent experiments on trapped
ultra-cold atomic gases [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. These cold gases are so weakly

Quantum quenches in 1+1D CFT

coupled to their environments as to allow the observation of essentially unitary time
evolution over very long time scales. One of the central results which has emerged
from these theoretical and experimental studies is that the dynamics of generic and
integrable systems is dramatically diﬀerent.
Indeed, while generic systems (locally)
thermalise (see e.g.
[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]), integrable models
attain stationary values of local observables described by diﬀerent statistical ensembles
[24] as a consequence of the inﬁnity of constraints imposed by local and quasi-local
integrals of motion.

One important point that has been clariﬁed in the last decade is that the concepts
of relaxation to a statistical ensemble and thermalisation are relative to subsystems
and not to the entire system (which, being initially in a pure state, will remain so for
any time). Indeed, denoting the time evolved state of an inﬁnite system as |ψ(t)(cid:105), one
introduces the reduced density matrix of the subsystem A as ρA(t) = TrA|ψ(t)(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ(t)|
(A being the complement of A). If for an arbitrary ﬁnite subsystem A, ρA(t) has an
inﬁnite time limit, then the system is said to admit (locally) a stationary state. If this
long time limit equals the reduced density matrix of the Gibbs statistical ensemble then
the system is said to thermalise.

The peculiar behaviour of integrable models is the main reason that motivated
the development of advanced analytical tools to investigate their quench dynamics for a
variety of diﬀerent situations and realistic models, see e.g. Refs. [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]
and other reviews in this volume. However, many insights into the quench dynamics
of many-body systems have come from the study of very simpliﬁed theories such as
1+1 dimensional conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT), which has become an ideal playground
in which to develop and check new ideas. For example, phenomena like the light-cone
spreading of correlations [25, 32], the linear increase of entanglement entropy [33], and
the structure of revivals in ﬁnite systems [34] have been ﬁrst described in CFT and later
generalised to more realistic models, and even veriﬁed in experiments (see [5] for the
experimental measure of the light-cone spreading of correlations). Furthermore, once
understood in CFT, some of these phenomena are readily generalised to more realistic
models.

The goal of this review is to give a self-contained presentation of the imaginary
time path integral approach to the quench dynamics of CFTs. Many important features
of integrable and generic systems will be mentioned only brieﬂy. For a comprehensive
treatment of all other aspects of the quench dynamics we refer the reader to the other
excellent reviews in this volume and to the already existing ones in the literature
[35, 36, 37, 38, 39].

The review is organised as follows. In Sec. 2 we review the imaginary time path
integral approach to global quantum quenches and we apply it to CFT with a particular
class of initial states. We describe the dynamical behaviour of correlation functions
and entanglement entropy. We highlight the phenomenon of light-cone spreading of
entanglement and correlations. We discuss in details the limit of applicability of these
results to realistic models and ﬁnally we generalise the formalism to include more general

Quantum quenches in 1+1D CFT

classes of initial states, to ﬁnite systems and to perturbed CFTs. In Sec. 3 we move
to local quantum quenches and again describe the time evolution of entanglement and
correlations. We discuss ﬁnite size eﬀects and how local quenches can be used to measure
entanglement. In Sec. 4 we brieﬂy review other quench protocols that can be studied
with the imaginary time formalism.

2. CFT approach to global quantum quenches

The CFT approach to global quantum quenches was originally developed in [25, 32] (see
also [33]) and later clariﬁed and generalised in [40]. Here we follow a presentation of the
material which mixes these original references, with the goal of being pedagogical.

We consider the time evolution of a one-dimensional quantum system from an initial
state |ψ0(cid:105), which we take to be translationally invariant, with short-range correlations
and entanglement, e.g. the ground state of a gapped hamiltonian H0. At time t = 0,
a hamiltonian parameter is changed abruptly and, for times t > 0, the system evolves
unitarily with a hamiltonian H (cid:54)= H0. The time evolved state in the Schr¨odinger picture
is clearly e−iHt|ψ0(cid:105). We are interested in the equal-time correlation functions of some

local operators Φj(xj)

(cid:104)ψ0|eiHtΦ1(x1)Φ2(x2) . . . Φn(xn)e

−iHt|ψ0(cid:105).

(1)

(The generalisation to correlations at diﬀerent times is straightforward.) This expression
can be rewritten in euclidean space (i.e. with imaginary time evolution) as

−Hτ2Φ1(x1)Φ2(x2) . . . Φn(xn)e

(cid:104)ψ0|e

−Hτ1|ψ0(cid:105).

(2)

This is nothing but the correlation function in an inﬁnite euclidean strip of width τ1 + τ2
and with boundary conditions on each edge corresponding to the state |ψ0(cid:105). In order
to recover the time evolution (1) from the strip geometry (2), we should analytically
continue the imaginary times as τ1 → it and τ2 → −it. But, doing so, one would end
up with the nonsensical situation of a strip of zero total width.

invariant boundary conditions |ψ∗

In the case when the time evolution is governed by a 1+1 dimensional CFT,
in [25, 32] we avoided this problem by appealing to the theory of boundary critical
phenomena: the actual boundary conditions at τ = τ1 and τ2 are replaced by conformal
0(cid:105) at τ = −τ0 + τ1 and τ = τ0 + τ2, where τ0 has
been identiﬁed with the so-called extrapolation length.
In the theory of boundary
critical phenomena, this is justiﬁed on the basis of the renormalisation group (RG):
the conformal invariant boundary condition corresponds to a ﬁxed point of the RG, and
τ0 measures the deviation of the actual state from this. For example, when dealing with
a free massless boson, possible conformal invariant boundary conditions are Dirichlet
with zero or inﬁnite ﬁeld. Once we take a ﬁnite τ0, it is then possible to analytically
continue τ1 = it and τ2 = −it.

For simplicity in the calculations, it is convenient to translate in imaginary time by
τ0 + τ1, and so we consider the following correlation function in the euclidean strip with

(3)

where τ must be consider a real number during the course of the calculation and only
at the end must be analytically continued to τ → τ0 + it.

This argument is based on the assumption that the long-time behaviour after the
quench should be insensitive to the details of the initial state as long as it has only short-
range correlations. As has been argued in [40], at least for the case of evolution with a
CFT hamiltonian, this is not in fact the case. Again in [40] the prescription of [25, 32]
was rephrased in a way that its assumptions are clearer and so may be generalised.
Indeed the above prescription is equivalent to assuming that the initial state has the
form

0(cid:105) is the once again the conformally invariant boundary state.

In this
reinterpretation, it is clear also why it is not possible to take the limit τ0 → 0, i.e.
that the conformally invariant boundary states are not normalisable (as is well known)
and the subsequent time evolution would not be well deﬁned. The prescription (4)
gives a ﬁnite result because it is equivalent to a smooth cutoﬀ of the ultraviolet modes

0(cid:105) has strictly vanishing

correlation length (inverse mass) of the initial state since |ψ∗
correlations and the prefector e−τ0H roughly correlates it on a scale τ0.

2.1. Correlation functions following a global quench

We have at this point to deal with the calculation of correlation functions in a strip
w = r + iτ with 0 < Im w < 2τ0 in which at both edges Im w = 0, 2τ0 there are the
0(cid:105). This geometry can be mapped to
0(cid:105) at the boundary Im w = 0) by the

same conformal invariant boundary conditions |ψ∗
the the upper half-plane (UHP) Im z > 0 (with |ψ∗

conformal transformation

w(z) = (2τ0/π) ln z .

(5)

In the case where all ﬁelds Φi(wi) are local primary scalar operators Φi(wi), the
expectation values in the strip and in the UHP are related as

where xi is the scaling dimension of the ﬁeld Φi. The asymptotic real time dependence

that after continuation ¯zi is no longer the complex conjugate of zi, and the two factors

In CFT the normalisations are chosen in such a way that (cid:104)Φ(z1)Φ(z2)(cid:105)bulk = |z2− z1|
This choice ﬁxes the amplitude AΦ
b that turns out to depend both on the considered ﬁeld
Φ and on the boundary condition on the boundary b [41]. AΦ
b vanishes if the expectation

value of Φ on |ψ∗

0(cid:105) vanishes, and thus (cid:104)Φ(t)(cid:105) = 0, for all times.

When the primary ﬁeld is not vanishing on the boundary, performing the conformal

mapping (5) we obtain

(cid:104)Φ(w)(cid:105)strip = |w

Thus any primary ﬁeld decays exponentially in time to zero (which is also the ground-
state value), with a non-universal relaxation time tΦ
rel = 2τ0/xπ. The ratio of the
relaxation times of two diﬀerent primaries equals the inverse of the ratio of their scaling
dimensions and it is universal.

2.3. The energy density

An important exception to the exponential decay in time is the local energy density
which corresponds to the tt component of the energy-momentum tensor Tµν. In CFT
this is not a primary operator. Indeed, if it is normalised so that (cid:104)Tµν(cid:105)UHP = 0, in the
strip we have [42]

(cid:104)Ttt(r, τ )(cid:105) =

πc

24(2τ0)2

(9)

(where c is the central charge of the CFT) so that it does not decay in time. Of course
this is to be expected since the dynamics conserves energy. A similar feature is expected
to hold for other local densities corresponding to globally conserved quantities which
commute with the hamiltonian, for example the magnetisation along z in an anisotropic
magnet with U (1) symmetry in the xy plane.

2.4. Two-point function of primary operators

Let us now consider the time evolution of a two-point function of primaries at distance
(cid:96). The two-point function in the upper half-plane assumes the general scaling form [43]

(cid:18) z1¯2z2¯1

where η = z1¯1z2¯2/z1¯2z2¯1 is the four point ratio constructed with z1, z2 and their images
¯z1, ¯z2, the function F (η) depends on the full operator content of the CFT. We need to

map this four-point function to the strip and consider the images points at w1 = 0 + iτ
and w2 = (cid:96)+iτ . With some simple algebra, and continuing to τ = τ0 +it (see [33, 25, 32]
for detailed calculations), we ﬁnd for t, (cid:96) (cid:29) τ0
(cid:104)Φ((cid:96), t)Φ(0, t)(cid:105) (cid:39)
After the conformal mapping and analytically continuing the four-point ratio η becomes

For t < (cid:96)/2, since t, (cid:96) (cid:29) τ0, we have eπ(cid:96)/2τ0 (cid:29) eπt/τ0 and so in the denominator above
we can neglect eπt/τ0 and η vanishes as η (cid:39) eπ(t−(cid:96)/2)/τ0. Oppositely for t > (cid:96)/2 we can
neglect eπ(cid:96)/2τ0 in the the denominator and we have η ∼ 1. Even if F (η) is generally
unknown, we conclude that we only need its behaviour close to η ∼ 0 and 1, that are
easily deduced from general scaling. Indeed when η ∼ 1 the two points are deep in the
bulk, meaning F (1) = 1. Instead for η (cid:28) 1, from the short-distance expansion, we have

couples and AΦ

two simple limiting values for t > (cid:96)/2 and t < (cid:96)/2 when t, (cid:96) (cid:29) τ0 which are proportional
to e−xπ(cid:96)/2τ0 and e−xπt/τ0 respectively.

2.5. Evolution of entanglement entropy after a global quantum quench

The entanglement entropy of a ﬁnite interval A of length (cid:96) in an inﬁnite system
can be easily obtained from the previous results by using the replica trick.
Indeed,

A is equivalent to the two-point function of twist operators (which under conformal
transformations behaves like primary operators) of dimension [44, 45]

where we explicitly use that the function of the four-point ratio F (η) is equal to 1 for
both η ∼ 0 and η ∼ 1 [45] which are the only two cases of interest. The constants cn
are non-universal normalisations [44].

At this point, the entanglement entropy SA = − Tr ρA ln ρA can be obtained by
continuing the above result to arbitrary real values of n, diﬀerentiating wrt n, and
taking n → 1. After simple algebra, we obtain [33]

that is SA(t) increases linearly until it saturates at t = (cid:96)/2. The sharp cusp in this
asymptotic result is rounded over a region |t − (cid:96)/2| ∼ τ0. In contrast with Ref. [33],
following [46], we have added explicitly the subleading constant term ln τ0 conﬁrming
that τ0 is proportional to the correlation length in the initial state, given that in an
equilibrium gapped system at zero temperature the entanglement entropy is c/3 ln ξ
[44].

From Eq. (16) it follows that the time dependence of all the R`enyi entropies

1 ≤ j ≤ N and uk < uk+1. Tr ρn
A is given by a 2N -point function of twist operator in a
strip of width 2τ0. We only need the asymptotic behaviour of this correlation function
for time t and separations |uj − uk| much larger than τ0. Several simpliﬁcations happen
in this regime and after long algebra one arrives at [33]

If N is ﬁnite (or more generally the uk are bounded) the second term vanishes for
suﬃciently large t. At shorter times, SA(t) exhibits piecewise linear behaviour in t
with cusps whenever 2t = uk − ul, at which the slope changes by ±πc/6τ0 according
to whether k − l is even or odd. In the case of an inﬁnite number of regular intervals,
with uk = k(cid:96), k ∈ Z, SA(t) exhibits a sawtooth behaviour. Eq. (18) has been checked
numerically against exact results in the critical harmonic chain [47] ﬁnding excellent
agreement. However, it has recently been pointed out [48, 49] that for a CFT with an
inﬁnite number of primary ﬁelds (e.g. CFTs with c > 1 and only Virasoro symmetry)
the valleys in SA(t) are partly ﬁlled in, and indeed they do not exist at all in holographic
theories with c (cid:29) 1. This may be traced to the existence of additional singularities in
the twist ﬁeld correlators in the real time domain, beyond those implied by the usual
OPE.

2.6. Thermalisation when starting from e−τ0H|ψ∗
0(cid:105)

The results presented in the previous subsections for the one- and two-point functions
of primaries are such that for large times they are those at ﬁnite temperature T with
β = 1/T = 4τ0. Also the extensive part of the entanglement entropy of a subsystem
with its complement equals for large time the Gibbs entropy at the same temperature.
We have also shown in Eq. (9) that the local energy density (being non primary) does
not relax. But, we also know that at ﬁnite temperature (cid:104)Ttt(cid:105)β = πc/6β2 [42, 50], that
is perfectly compatible with a long time thermal expectation with β = 4τ0. It has been
shown in [40] that arbitrary multipoint correlation of primaries are indeed described by
the thermal ensemble. Overall these results suggest that the system should be locally
described by a thermal ensemble at a temperature corresponding to the conserved energy
density.

In [32], we pointed out a simple technical reason why we ﬁnd an eﬀective
temperature for long time. The ﬁnite temperature correlations can be calculated by
studying the ﬁeld theory on a cylinder of circumference β. In CFT a cylinder can be
obtained by mapping the complex plane with the logarithmic transformation β/(2π) ln z.
Focusing for simplicity of the two-point function of primaries, their form in the strip
depends in general on the function F (η) – cf. Eq. (10) – but when we analytically
continue and take the limit of large real time, we ﬁnd that eﬀectively the points are far
from the boundary, i.e. at η ≈ 1. Thus we get the same result as we would get if we
conformally transformed from the full plane to a cylinder, and from Eq. (5) the eﬀective
temperature is β = 4τ0. A similar argument can be worked out for the multi-point
functions as well, see [40] for details.

However, the above argument leaves open the question of other correlation
functions, such as those of non-primary operators. To ﬁll this gap it was pointed out
in [40] that the reduced density matrix of an interval is close to that of a thermal
ensemble, once the interval has fallen inside the horizon. This then implies that all
equal-time correlation functions of local operators (with arguments in the interval) are
close to their thermal values.

The reasoning of Ref. [40] proceeds as follows. Consider an interval A of length

continued to τ = it. For real τ the numerator of this expression is the partition function

where Z(S ⊕ C) is the partition function on S sewn onto C, in such a way that the
bottom edge of the slit in S is sewn to the top edge of C and vice versa. As already
mentioned, in a CFT these partition functions may be viewed as correlators of twist
operators T evaluated in the product of the CFTs on each component [44, 51], i.e.

(22)

where now (cid:104)T (x1, τ )T (x2, τ )(cid:105)S⊗C means the twist correlator on a direct product of the
CFT on S with that on C.

The twist operators enjoy the same analyticity properties of primary operators in a
CFT and therefore we may use the earlier arguments applied to correlators of primaries
to compute (22). Applying the conformal mapping (5), they are related to correlators

of twist operators on CFTs on H⊗ C, H⊗ H, C⊗ C, with H being the upper-half plane.
Once the points (x1, τ ) and (x2, τ ) have fallen into the horizon, the cross-ratio η12 is
(cid:28) 1, and we may use the operator product expansion (OPE).

The OPE of twist operators is expressed as a sum of products of local operators in

each sheet as [52, 53]

(23)

where Φk1 and Φk2 are a complete set of operators (arranged in order of increasing
dimension) in copies of the CFT. The coeﬃcients Ck1,k2 are calculable, but their values
are not interesting for the present calculation. The leading term in (22) comes from
taking Φk1 = Φk2 = 1, so that, once the ends of the interval have fallen inside the
horizon, Eq. (22) is asymptotically equal to one. The leading correction comes from
the operators (Φk1, Φk2) with the lowest dimension and such that they have non-zero
expectation values. The lowest dimension operators are usually primary which have
vanishing expectation value in C. Consequently, the leading corrections come only from
the ﬁrst factor in the denominator of (22) and correspond to the most relevant operators
which have a non-vanishing expectation values on (H, H) given the particular boundary
state |ψ∗

0(cid:105). Denoting with ∆ the dimension of this operator, we have

showing that long time after the quench the reduced density matrix of an arbitrary
interval is exponentially close to the reduced density matrix of a thermal ensemble.

The thermalisation found in this section is however rather strange since conformal
ﬁeld theories are prototypes of quantum integrable models. Due to the many local
or quasi-local conservations, it is indeed generically expected that for large times the

system should converge to a generalised Gibbs ensemble (GGE) in which all the integral
of motions are present. As ﬁrstly pointed out in [40], this is just a due to the very
special initial state (4) we considered so far.
Indeed, by perturbing this initial state
with irrelevant boundary operators, it can be shown that the asymptotic state is a GGE
rather than a thermal one. We will report explicitly this argument in Sec. 2.11.

2.7. Light-cone spreading of entanglement and correlations

We have seen in the previous section that the correlation functions and the entanglement
display a non-analytic behaviour on the light-cone at t = (cid:96)/2 for a conformal post-quench
evolution. These non-analyticities can be understood as a light-cone like spreading
of entanglement and correlation which can be physically motivated by the following
argument (ﬁrstly proposed in [33] and later generalised in [25, 32]). This scenario is
generically valid for a large class of quenches starting from a state with short-range
correlations and entanglement (such as the ground state of a gapped hamiltonian) and
it is not restricted to conformal invariant post-quench hamiltonians. We ﬁrstly explain
how the argument works for the entanglement entropy and after for correlations.

A generic initial state |ψ0(cid:105) for a global quantum quench has a very high energy
relative to the ground state of the post-quench hamiltonian, and therefore acts as a
source of quasiparticle excitations. Particles emitted from diﬀerent points (further apart
than the correlation length in the initial state) are incoherent, but pairs of particles
moving to the left or right from a given point are entangled. We denote with ρ(p)
the rate of production of such a pair of particles of momenta (p,−p), The function ρ(p)
depends on the post-quench hamiltonian H and on the initial state |ψ0(cid:105), and in principle
is calculable, but we do not make any assumptions on its form. We instead assume

t2t2tlt2t > l2t < lABBABBQuantum quenches in 1+1D CFT

12

that, once the two quasiparticles separate, they move classically. If the quasiparticle
dispersion relation is E = Ep, the velocity is vp = dEp/dp. A quasiparticle of momentum
p produced at x is therefore at x ± vpt at time t, ignoring scattering eﬀects. We assume
that there is a maximum allowed speed vmax, i.e. |vp| ≤ vmax. There are various reasons
to assume so: in a lattice model this is a consequence of Lieb-Robinson bound [54], in
a relativistic ﬁeld theory it follows from causality, and in some other cases it could just
happen that the quench populates only modes with a ﬁnite velocities.

∈ A will be entangled with that at a point x(cid:48)(cid:48)

Let us now bipartition the one-dimensional system in two complementary parts A
and B. We are interested in the entanglement entropy between them. We then consider
these quasiparticles as they reach either A or B at time t. The ﬁeld at some point
x(cid:48)
∈ B if a pair of entangled particles
emitted from a point x arrive simultaneously at x(cid:48) and x(cid:48)(cid:48) (see Fig. 1 for the case of A
consisting of a single interval). We assume that the entanglement entropy between x(cid:48)
and x(cid:48)(cid:48) is proportional to the length of the interval in x for which this can be satisﬁed.
Thus the total entanglement entropy is

dx

where f (p) is equal to the product of ρ(p) with the contribution of a given pair to the
entanglement entropy. Now we specialise to the case where A is an interval of length (cid:96).
The integrations over the coordinates are easily done, so that

(26)

Since |vp| ≤ vmax, the second term cannot contribute if t < t∗ = (cid:96)/2vmax, so that SA(t) is
strictly proportional to t. On the other hand as t → ∞, the ﬁrst term is negligible (this
assumes that vp does not vanish except at isolated points), and SA is asymptotically
proportional to (cid:96). However, unless |v| = vmax everywhere (as is the case of a CFT with
vmax = 1), SA is not strictly proportional to (cid:96) for t > t∗, since the ﬁrst term in (26)
does not vanish. The approach to the stationary value depends on the behaviour of
f (p) in the regions where vp → 0. This generally happens at the zone boundary, and,
for a non-critical quench, also at p = 0. Since usually close to its zeroes pi, vp is linear
vp ∼ (p − pi), and assuming f (p) to be regular at pi, we expect that for large times the
ﬁrst term in (26) vanishes as (cid:96)2/t. However, this can change depending on the explicit
form of vp and f (p).

We mention that also the complicated form (18) for the entanglement entropy of
N disjoint intervals can be easily understood in terms of this picture with vp = 1 for
all p and can be generalised to quasiparticles with diﬀerent velocities [33]. Furthermore
also the R`enyi entropy for arbitrary n have the same form (26) but with a n-dependent
function fn(p). It is also possible to quantify in speciﬁc lattice models the contribution
to the entanglement entropy of two given points in A and B by means of the so-called
entanglement contour [55]. Also its time dependence after a quench is compatible with
this quasi-particle picture in the case of free fermionic models, a case for which it has

Quantum quenches in 1+1D CFT

13

been explicitly checked [55]. Some results for the spreading of entanglement are also
available in higher dimensions [56].

The same picture explains also the behaviour of correlation functions of local
operators. Indeed, entangled quasi-particles arriving at the same time t at points with
separation (cid:96) induce also correlations between local observables. In the case when they
travel at a unique speed v (as in CFT), there is a sharp light cone and connected
correlations do not change signiﬁcantly from their initial values until time t ∼ (cid:96)/2v. In
the CFT case this light-cone eﬀect is rounded oﬀ over the region t − (cid:96)/2v ∼ τ0, since
quasi-particles remain correlated over this distance scale. After this they saturate to
time-independent values.

In any realistic condensed matter model the precise time dependence of the
correlators depends on many details of the theory and of the considered operators.
In particular there is no degree of universality since the quench populates high energy
modes. However, the above quasi-particle picture can be used as a starting point for
a semiclassical approach to quenches as for example done in [57, 58, 59, 60, 61]. This
semiclassical approach allow to calculate time-dependent correlation functions in the
limit of low density of excitations after the quench, which in some cases turned out to
reproduce quite accurately also the ﬁnite density correlations, see e.g.
[59] for some
comparisons of the semiclassical against exact computations.

2.8. Some further results in 1+1 conformal global quenches

In this subsection we brieﬂy mention a few other results for global quantum quenches
that can be derived with the imaginary time formalism of the previous subsections, but
that for lack of space we cannot review properly.

In Ref. [25, 32], the two-point function of primaries at diﬀerent times was explicitly

computed, obtaining (in the case with F (η) = 1)

 e

−xπ(t+s)/4τ0

for t − s < r < t + s ,
for r < |t − s| .

(27)

These results were generalised to the two-time response function in [62].

Quantum quenches in the presence of boundaries were also studied in the framework
of boundary CFT [32, 63], but the results are very similar to those in the bulk and we
do not discuss them here.

In [47], the time evolution of the entanglement entropy, of the mutual information
and of the so called entanglement negativity of many disjoint intervals has been
investigated in great details. The obtained results are compatible with the quasi-particle
picture for the spreading of entanglement, see also [64].

The imaginary time formalism can be used also to treat massive ﬁeld theories, but

the results in this case are much less general as, for example, discussed in [65].

2.9. Insights and diﬀerences when comparing with realistic condensed matter models

Contrary to naive expectations, the results derived in the previous sections for conformal
ﬁeld theories do not always apply to critical models whose low-energy physics is described
by a CFT, as it is the case in equilibrium at low enough temperature. In the literature
the CFT predictions for global quenches have been often taken far beyond their regime
of applicability, especially when comparing with results for lattice models. One of the
main drawbacks that is often overlooked is that CFT gives an accurate description
only of the low energy properties of (some) gapless one dimensional quantum models.
However, in performing a global quench, a large (indeed extensive) amount of energy
is injected into the system and generically one populates states in the middle of the
many-body spectrum, a region which is well beyond the regime of applicability of CFT.
Another drawback is that in a CFT all the quasi-particle excitations move with the
same speed (which here has been ﬁxed to unity) independently of their energy. As
already stressed in the subsection about light-cone spreading 2.7, this is not the case for
a generic gapless model, even with a free particle description (such as the tight binding
model or the critical Ising model). Indeed, while for small momentum k, the dispersion
relation Ek has a CFT form Ek ∼ v|k|, for larger values of k it becomes a non-trivial
function of the momentum.

The last problematic issue concerns the initial state we are considering, in particular
the identiﬁcation of τ0 which should be handled carefully. Indeed, we have argued (see
also [25, 32]) that, when the initial ﬁeld-theoretical correlation length ξ0 is small, we
roughly expect τ0 ∝ ξ0. However, when comparing with a lattice model, the ﬁeld
theoretic description is appropriate only when ξ0 is much larger that the lattice spacing.
Mathematically, one should ﬁrst consider the scaling limit in which the correlation length
in terms of the lattice spacing diverges and later consider distances and times much larger
than the resulting ﬁeld-theoretical correlation length. Physically (and in practice), one
should hope that for a given lattice model there is a regime in which a (cid:28) ξ0 (cid:28) (cid:96), t.
Thus even in models which are described to a great level of accuracy by a CFT (such
as a lattice Dirac fermion or the harmonic chain in speciﬁc regimes), the initial state
plays a crucial rule for ﬁnding results compatible with the picture highlighted in the
previous subsections. A more general class of initial states will be explicitly considered
in Sec. 2.11.

After having listed the main drawbacks in trying to quantitatively compare the
CFT predictions for global quenches with explicit results in condensed matter systems,
we can proceed to show some of these results and discuss what we can learn from CFT
for more realistic models. We start by showing the results for the time evolution of the
entanglement entropy in a quench in the transverse ﬁeld Ising chain described by the
hamiltonian

phases, separated by a quantum critical point described by a CFT (see [66] for the
description of the equilibrium behaviour of this model). We report results for the
quench from a given transverse ﬁeld h0 to another value h (cid:54)= h0.
In the left panel
of Fig. 2 we show the results for a quench to the critical point h = 1 starting from the
product state at h0 = ∞ (to mimic a boundary conformally invariant state). We can
see that the entanglement entropy grows linearly for t < (cid:96)/2, in agreement with CFT
and the quasiparticle picture with the known sound velocity vmax = 1. For t > (cid:96)/2, the
entanglement entropy does not saturate abruptly as in a CFT, but continues to increase
slowly. We can understand this as the eﬀect of the slower quasi-particles as explained in
Sec. 2.7. In the right panel of Fig. 2 we report the time evolution of the entanglement
entropy for an interval of ﬁxed length, starting always from the initial state with h0 = ∞
and the various curves correspond to diﬀerent values of the ﬁnal value of the ﬁeld h. It
is evident that all curves show the same behaviour, characterised by the same velocity
vmax = 1, but with a rate of growth of the entropy depending on the quench parameters.
Again this behaviour is fully compatible with the quasi-particle picture and it shows
how the linear increase of the entanglement entropy, followed by an almost saturation
is a generic feature of many quenches and it is not restricted to conformal invariant and
gapless situations. For a general quench in the Ising model, indeed the time dependence
of the entanglement entropy in the so called space-time scaling regime (i.e. for t, (cid:96) → ∞
with the t/(cid:96) kept ﬁxed) has been derived exactly [67], obtaining

formula shows that the quasi-particle picture not only gives a qualitative description
of the dynamics, but also provides accurate quantitative prediction such as (26) which
coincides with (29) after identifying f (p) with H(cos ∆k).

Indeed, the linear growth of the entanglement entropy followed by an almost
saturation has been observed numerically in a very large number of exact calculations
and in quantum simulations, such as in [63, 64, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74] (but this
list is far from being exhaustive). The standard quasi-particle picture breaks down in
models with disorder, for which it has been shown that the growth of entanglement is
logarithmic in time (or slower) [63, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79], and in model with long-range
interactions [80, 81, 82, 83, 85].

The linear growth of the entanglement entropy in time is also a very important
physical phenomenon to understand why algorithms based on matrix product states
[86] (such as the density matrix renormalisation group [87] in its time dependent version
[88] or iTEBD [89]) fail to describe the quench dynamics for large times. Indeed, it has
been established that a matrix product state built with a tensor of auxiliary dimension
χ can eﬀectively encode a quantum state whose entanglement entropy is of order of
log χ (see e.g. Refs. [90, 91] for a more precise statement). Given that the entanglement
entropy after a global quench grows linearly in time, one would need that the auxiliary
dimension of the matrix product state should grow exponentially with time and this
contrasts with the limited computational resources at disposal.

Let us now discuss the behaviour of correlation functions and let us again start
by reviewing some exact results for the Ising chain (28), whose correlation functions
after a quench have been determined analytically in [92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97] (see
[98, 99, 100, 101, 102] for earlier numerical works). When starting from the ferromagnetic
|h0| < 1) in such a way to have a non-zero initial order parameter, and
phase (i.e.
quenching to a point with h ≤ 1, it has been shown that at late times the order

a behaviour which is reminiscent of the CFT prediction (8). This exponential decay
has been indeed found also in other, even interacting, models [103, 104]. For the same
quench, the equal time two-point function of the order parameter in the space-time
scaling limit has been found to be [92, 93]

This exact results shows several important properties of the quench dynamics. Since vk
is bounded |vk| < vmax, the two-point function decays exponentially in time for vmaxt < (cid:96)
and then saturates slowly to a value which is exponentially small in the separation. This
is the same as the CFT behaviour (14) but it is generically valid for any quench within
the ferromagnetic phase up to the critical point in the post-quench hamiltonian. In the
limit (cid:96) → ∞ the ﬁrst term vanishes showing that the two-point function is the square
of the one-point one and so cluster decomposition holds during the quench dynamics.
Furthermore, the ﬁrst term is zero for all times such that 2vmaxt < (cid:96) and hence the
connected correlation is vanishing in this regime. This is a feature which was ﬁrst
shown in CFT, but which is generically valid and it goes nowadays under the name of
light-cone spreading of correlations or alternatively horizon eﬀect. In Fig. 3 numerical
data are reported for the two-point function for quenches from the ferromagnetic phase
to both the same phase (left) and to the paramagnetic phase (right). In the former case,
it is clear that (a part a short transient) the data are well described by Eq. (31). In the
latter instead it is evident that something new takes place since the relaxation of the
two-point function is oscillating. This has no analogy in the CFT calculations, but it is
not unexpected since the post-quench hamiltonian is massive. We do not report plots
for quenches from the paramagnetic phase (they can be found in [93]), but we simply
mention that in this case the dynamics is very complicated compared to the CFT one.
The main important point to stress is that the connected correlation functions always
vanish for 2vmaxt < (cid:96) (more precisely they are exponentially suppressed) and the light-
cone spreading is valid.

As we already said, the light-cone spreading of correlations is a very general eﬀect
that was ﬁrstly understood in CFT [25, 32]. Since then it has been observed in dozens
of numerical simulations and exact calculations (see e.g.
[68, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109,
110, 111]) and ﬁnally it has been also experimentally demonstrated in a cold-atomic
setup [5].

The exact calculations for the Ising model show also one of the limits of the CFT
calculations presented. For large times, the two-point function (31) is not thermal.
Indeed it has been shown that this correlator and the entire reduced density matrix of
an arbitrary ﬁnite subsystem (and hence arbitrary correlations of all local operators)
are described by a generalised Gibbs ensemble (GGE) built with all the local charges

Quantum quenches in 1+1D CFT

18

of the model [94, 96]. In Sec. 2.11 we will see that this peculiar CFT behaviour is due
to the particular choice of the initial state and that more general initial conditions will
indeed approach for large times a GGE.

Finally,

it is worth mentioning that several CFT results for global quantum
quenches both for the entanglement entropy and correlations have been re-obtained in
the holographic framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence and generalised to higher
dimensional CFTs [112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125,
126, 127, 128, 129, 130].
In this approach the thermalisation of a strongly coupled
CFT is equivalent to the formation of a black hole in the AdS space, while a GGE is a
higher-spin black hole [130].

2.10. Revivals in ﬁnite systems

We argued in Sec. 2.6 that the density matrix of a interval of length (cid:96) become stationary
after a time (cid:39) (cid:96)/2v, after which it is described by a thermal ensemble at a temperature
corresponding to the conserved energy density. These considerations were made in the
thermodynamic limit, but the result can be extended [34] to the case of ﬁnite total length
of the system L as long as (cid:96)/2 < t < (L − (cid:96))/2 (for periodic boundary conditions).

However, according to the quasi-particle picture, in a conformal periodic (or open)
system an oppositely moving pair of particles will meet again at times which are integer
multiples of L/2 (respectively L), and this should generically lead to a revival of the
initial state. In fact, in the transverse ﬁeld XY spin chain [59, 58, 131] and in Luttinger
liquids [132] such revivals in the expectation values of local observables have been
observed, and also in the entanglement entropy for a free Dirac fermion [133].

Here we describe the extension of the methods reviewed in previous sections to the
case of ﬁnite systems as ﬁrstly presented in [34]. We compute the return amplitude, or

ﬁdelity F(t) = |(cid:104)ψ0|e−iHt|ψ0(cid:105)|, by relating it to the partition function of the CFT on

an annulus (or rectangle for open boundary conditions) continued to complex values of
its modulus or aspect ratio. These CFT partition functions are known in many cases
and hence we are able to obtain several analytic results. We note in passing that in
recent papers [134] a similar quantity has been studied for various lattice models, and
its singularities interpreted as dynamical phase transitions at ﬁnite t. For the case of a
CFT studied here, the singularities occur close to every rational value of t/L and are
simply related to full or partial revivals of the initial state.

As before, we take as initial state |ψ0(cid:105) ∝ e−τ0H|ψ∗

0(cid:105), where |ψ∗

values (mod Z) is still ﬁnite, but for a general CFT with c > 1 it is inﬁnite and their
mean density grows exponentially with ∆1/2 [137].

The main needed property of the characters is that they are holomorphic in the
upper half τ -plane, and that they transform linearly under a representation of the
modular group SL(2, Z), generated by S : τ → −1/τ and T : τ → τ + 1. The ﬁrst
property ensures that the continuation to τ = 2(−t + iτ0)/L implied in (32) makes
sense, and the second allows us to relate the values of F(t) at diﬀerent times to those

density of states, valid for EL (cid:29) c, after performing a steepest descent approximation
for F. However, for holographic CFTs, i.e. those with c (cid:29) 1 and a sparse density of
states with EL (cid:28) c, the above density of states formula is supposed [138] to hold also
for EL = O(c), in which case it may be argued that (34) holds out to times t = O(cL).
Thus for these CFTs we expect to see no revivals at times t = O(L). This is consistent
with the holographic interpretation of the quench as forming a black hole in the AdS
spacetime [112].

On the other hand, for minimal CFTs t = nL/2 corresponds to τ ≈ −n. We may
then relate the value of ZA at this point to that near τ = 0, and then as τ → i∞ using
the transformation properties of the characters. In the limit L/τ0 → ∞, this gives

where S and T are the corresponding matrices according to which the characters
transform. It follows that as long these are ﬁnite dimensional (as for the the minimal
models or more generally a rational CFT), the value of F(t) at t = nL/2 is therefore
ﬁnite (although, as we shall see below, it may accidentally vanish). At times within
(2Lτ0)1/2 of this there is a similar decay to that in (34) with t replaced by |t− nL/2|. If
M is the lowest common denominator of all the {∆}, then, since all the energy gaps of H
(of even parity) are quantised in units of 4π/LM , there must always be complete revival
(F = 1) at multiples of t = M L/2. For the minimal models, the Kac formula implies
that in M ∼ 24/(1− c) and therefore in general the time for a complete revival diverges
as c → 1−. We also ﬁnd (numerically) that in the same limit the return amplitude at

any ﬁxed revival time goes to zero exponentially fast. A similar result should hold for
other sequences of rational CFTs with a maximal value of c.

Although ﬁnite values of F occur only at integer values of 2t/L, in fact there is
interesting universal structure near every rational value. This is because the characters
are singular at τ = 0, and the modular group maps this to every rational point τ = n/m
on the real line. This is mapped to τ = 0 by applying ST n1ST n2 . . ., where (n1, n2, . . .)
are the integers appearing in the continued fraction expansion of n/m. However the
nearby point τ = n/m + i2τ0/L is mapped to τ ≈ im2(2τ0/L) and so we ﬁnd, after
normalising with the denominator of (32),

F(nL/2m) ∝ (e

−πL/τ0)(c/24)(1−1/m2) .

(36)

Once again, at nearby values of t, this is modiﬁed in a similar manner to (34). A
more careful analysis also shows that the correction terms may be neglected only for
m (cid:28) (L/τ0)1/2, so that for a ﬁxed τ0/L the structure near only a ﬁnite number of rational
values will be evident. This result shows that if we deﬁne a ‘large deviation function’
− limL/τ0→∞(τ0/πL) log F(t), it is a sum of delta functions of strength ∝ 1/m2 at each
rational value n/m of 2t/L, on top of the uniform plateau value c/24. This structure may
be understood in the quasiparticle picture as being due to the simultaneous emission at
t = 0 of entangled pairs of particles separated by distances which are integer divisors of
L.

Many of these features are present in the simplest minimal CFT, corresponding
to the scaling limit of the Ising model with c = 1/2. There are three distinct
conformal boundary states, corresponding to the scaling limits of free and ﬁxed boundary
conditions on the Ising spins. In the last two cases [135], corresponding to a quench
in the transverse ﬁeld Ising model to the critical point from the ground state from the

Left: Log of the return amplitude for the Ising CFT starting from a
disordered state for 0 < 2t/L < 2, with πτ0/L = 0.05. The vertical axis has been
shifted so as to expose the mean plateau behaviour. This shows the initial gaussian
decay and revival at t = L. The negative peak at t = L/2 is due to destructive
interference between two kinds of quasiparticles. Smaller gaussian peaks are seen
at rational values with small denominators. The positive peaks are mapped by the
modular group to the initial peak, and the negative ones to the feature at 2t/L = 1.
Right: Same as left with πτ0/L = 0.005. Now there is structure at more rational

where q(cid:48) = e−4πτ0/L, ˜q(cid:48) = e−πL/τ0, and we have retained only the dominant term in the
second step. For n odd this gives F(nL/2) = 1/2, while for n even we get | cos(πn/16)|.
There is complete revival at t = 8L, while at t = 4L the coeﬃcient vanishes, leaving a
much smaller term O((e−πL/τ0)1/16).

On the other hand, for free boundary conditions [135], corresponding to a quench

from the disordered phase,

Z freeA = χ0(q) + χ1/2(q) = χ0(˜q) + χ1/2(˜q) .

(39)

At t = nL/2, we get χ0(q(cid:48)) + (−1)nχ1/2(q(cid:48)), so for n even there is complete revival,
expression may also be written as Z freeA = q−1/48(cid:81)∞
but, for odd n, χ0 − χ1/2 = √2χ1/16( ˜q(cid:48)), so again the revival is suppressed. The above

2.11. Quench from a more general boundary state and the GGE

So far we have considered a quench from a state of the form e−τ0H|ψ∗

0(cid:105). This was
chosen mainly for the fact that it leads to simple analytic results, but it also has the
property of thermalisation to a Gibbs distribution for any subsystem. Instead, in an
integrable model, as a consequence of the existence of an inﬁnite number of conserved
quantities commuting with the hamiltonian, the stationary state is expected to be
described by a generalised Gibbs ensemble (GGE) rather than a Gibbs distribution [24].
This has been shown to be correct for models admitting a free-particle representation,
as e.g.
in Refs. [24, 32, 92, 94, 96, 72, 132, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147].
Some GGEs were then explicitly constructed for truly interacting integrable models
for which an exact solution for the stationary state was not yet available [65, 148,

0.51.01.52.02tL(cid:45)10(cid:45)5510logF0.51.01.52.02tL(cid:45)10(cid:45)5510logFQuantum quenches in 1+1D CFT

22

149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154].
It has later been shown that the GGE built with
the (ultra-)local charges were correct only for those models with a single species of
quasi-particles [155, 156, 157, 158, 159]. Contrarily,
in order to match the exact
solutions for more general models [160, 161, 162], ultra local charges are not suﬃcient
[163, 164, 165, 166, 167]. Only recently it has been understood [168] that newly
discovered quasi-local charges [169, 170, 171, 172] must be indeed included in the GGE to
match the exact solutions. All these results in integrable models rise a natural question:
How a GGE can appear in a CFT, which (in the rational case) is the most integrable
model of all? In this section we argue that the relaxation to the Gibbs distribution in
a CFT is a consequence of the choice of initial state (4), and that a more general state
leads to a form of the GGE. The arguments are a condensed version of those given in
[40].

We remind the reader that boundary renormalisation group (RG) shows that each
bulk CFT has a particular allowed set of boundary states, each of which corresponds to
a ﬁxed point of the RG with its own basins of attraction. For the minimal models, there
is a ﬁnite number of these boundary states, and their basins of attraction are expected
to contain the ground states of all non-critical hamiltonians H0. Thus this ground state

should be representable in terms of all possible irrelevant operators acting on |ψ∗

suitably regularised. One of these irrelevant operators is the component Ttt of the stress
tensor, whose space integral is the hamiltonian. Thus the ansatz (4) is equivalent to
assume that this is the only term in the above sum. Ttt may be written as a sum
of holomorphic and antiholomorphic operators T and T , each of which is conserved
and whose space integral is a conserved charge. This is true also for all the irrelevant
operators which are its descendants, that can be written as powers of T and derivatives
thereof, plus their antiholomorphic partners. As we will show, the conformal quench
dynamics starting from such a state leads to a stationary reduced density matrix for a
ﬁnite interval A which has the GGE form

where now Φk and Φk are holomorphic and antiholomorphic bulk operators so that their

H (k) =

(Φk(x, τ ) + Φk(x, τ ))dx ,

(42)

do not necessarily commute among themselves, but they all commute with the CFT
hamiltonian. The standard GGE includes only a commuting sub-algebra of the H (k).
This is motivated by the idea that these should form a complete set of commuting
observables which should characterise any macrostate. However, this does not seem to
be the case for a 1D CFT for which, because of the exactly linear dispersion relation,
there is a massive degeneracy of states, and the expectation values of the charges in

Quantum quenches in 1+1D CFT

23

the commuting sub-algebra (identiﬁed in [139]) are not suﬃcient to characterise the
states. A similar phenomenon has been pointed out by Sotiriadis [173] in the context of
a quench in a 1D massless free boson theory from a non-gaussian initial state, although
in this case the commuting set of conserved charges is formed by the mode occupation
numbers.

However, this treatment still does not account for all possible irrelevant boundary
operators in the state (40). In [40] it is argued that, at least in rational CFTs, for every

boundary operator (cid:101)Φk there is a pair of holomorphic and antiholomorphic operators

(Φk, Φk) with the same overall scaling dimension ∆k. These also lead to conserved
charges and a generalisation of (41). However, since ∆k can be non-integer, these
currents are parafermionic and the corresponding charges are non-local. Although such
charges are not customarily included in the GGE, they make perfect sense and they
lead to physically sensible results.

Let us rewrite the initial state (40) as

commutators of H with a given local operator generate others, the net eﬀect is just to
modify the values of βk.

involves integrals of boundary correlators of the (cid:101)Φk which are UV divergent if ∆k > 1.

As it stands, Eq. (43) is only formal because, expanded in powers of the βk, it

These divergences may be canceled in the usual way by imposing a UV cut-oﬀ in real
space, identifying the UV divergent terms by using the OPE, and adding counterterms.
This has the eﬀect that the renormalised βk appearing in (43) then depend on the bare
values in a complicated non-linear fashion.

This perturbative expansion is expected to make sense for all irrelevant boundary
operators with ∆k > 1. For relevant operators one may expect to encounter infrared
divergences signalling the crossover to a diﬀerent boundary ﬁxed point. However, τ0

along contours just above and below the lower and upper boundaries τ = ±τ0/2. There
is a contour for each k, and they should be ordered in increasing k. Because of the
(anti-)holomorphicity, each of these contours may be freely deformed into the bulk, as
long as they do not cross each other or the arguments of local observables in correlation
functions. This corresponds to the statement that the charges which are the space
integral these currents commute with the hamiltonian (up to boundary conditions in

summed over two contours: one from z = 0 to real +∞, the other from z = 0 to real
−∞. The omitted terms in the above are the contributions of other (holomorphic)
descendants, which are present because some of the Φk are not primary. These will
disappear when reversing the mapping going to the cylinder.

Let us now continue the arguments of the local observables to real time. At late
times the ¯zj move oﬀ to −i∞ so that eﬀectively the boundary disappears. However,
the boundary perturbations given by the contour integrals remain.
In the absence
of the boundary, we can rotate one contour into the other, giving a relative factor
(e−iπ/2)∆k + (eiπ/2)∆k = 2 cos(π∆k/2). Only even integer dimensional charges contribute
because the odd ones are odd under parity and vanish on the initial state.

the path integral action of the term(cid:80)

On transforming back to the w-plane (which is a cylinder), we ﬁnd an insertion in
k βk cos(π∆k/2)H (k) along τ = τ0. However, given
that all H (k) commute with the hamiltonian, this contour could be along any constant
imaginary time line that does not separate any of the arguments wj of the operators.
However, the contours for diﬀerent k must be correctly ordered, as a consequence of the
fact that the H (k) do not in general commute among themselves.

Thus the reduced density matrix (at times after all the subsystem has fallen within

the same horizon) are given by a path integral with weight

k βk cos(π∆k/2)H (k)

(46)

where the ﬁrst term is the standard CFT action. Eq. (46) is the desired path integral
formulation of a (non-Abelian) GGE.

This CFT GGE has many observable consequences, described in detail in [40]. The
main feature is that the eﬀective inverse temperature, of which there is just a single one
β in the Gibbs ensemble, now depends on the observable – for example, it is diﬀerent
for each equal-time correlation function (cid:104)ΦΦ(cid:105) if extracted from the correlation length
2πxΦ/βeﬀ, an eﬀect which also shows up in the time-dependence of the 1-point function
(cid:104)Φ(r, t)(cid:105); it gives a diﬀerent relation between the entropy and the energy density, and
so on.

These somewhat formal results may be checked by perturbation theory in the βk.
For example, the ﬁrst order correction to the exponential decay of a 1-point function gets
a relative correction O(βkt). This may be seen to come from the boundary operators
within a distance t of the point r. Although this appears to be larger than the zeroth
order term, it may be argued that it then exponentiates to give the required O(βk)
correction to the decay rate. This has been veriﬁed for the Ising model [92] with an
explicit form for the decay rate.

When the ∆k are non-integer, however, the associated charges H (k) (cf. Eq. (42))
do not quite commute with the hamiltonian. This is because if we consider a closed

Quantum quenches in 1+1D CFT

25

contour which is the boundary of a long rectangle (−L/2 < u < L/2, τ1 < τ < τ2),
the contributions from the end pieces do not cancel for periodic boundary conditions
since they carry diﬀerent phases e±i∆k. They would in fact cancel for suitable twisted
boundary conditions on the ﬁelds of the theory. Thus we may think of the action of a
single H (k) as switching the boundary conditions between diﬀerent sectors of the theory.
It is a parafermionic charge. If ∆k is rational, with lowest denominator M , it is only
after acting M times that we return to the original boundary conditions. Thus, in the

j σx

As an example, one can consider a quench in the Ising chain with both transverse
and longitudinal ﬁeld, i.e. hamiltonian (28) with the addition of −hx
j . One
starts from the ground state with hz (cid:29) 1 and |hx| (cid:28) 1 and quench to the critical
point hz = 1, hx = 0. The appropriate conformal boundary state when hx (cid:29) 1 and
hz = 0 is that corresponding to free boundary conditions on the σx
j . This state supports
one primary operator of scaling dimension δ = 1/2 which is interpreted as the scaling
limit of the local magnetisation σx. Turning on a small hx is equivalent to perturb the
boundary state with a relevant operator and so we we have to consider the window
hx (cid:28) β−1/2 ∼ (hx − 1)1/2, as argued above. The holomorphic and anti-holomorphic
extensions of this boundary operator are in this case well understood – they are nothing
but the fermions (ψ(z), ¯ψ(¯z)) of the bulk Ising CFT. Thus the GGE in the case should
contain fermionic charges which, as is well known, act to switch between periodic and
anti-periodic boundary conditions on the Ising spins σz.

Finally, it must be mentioned that these results are also relevant to the physics of
prethermalization [174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 180, 179, 181, 73, 182] in models with weak
integrability breaking. A prethermalized regime has been observed in experiments [175]
and it is a crossover from a prethermalization plateau described by a GGE (as in this
section) to the truly stationary thermal state of the non-integrable model.

2.12. Quench to a CFT perturbed by an irrelevant operator

We consider what happens when the time evolution is governed by a hamiltonian
diﬀering from that of a CFT by the addition of irrelevant operators. In equilibrium,
these give only corrections to scaling, but their inﬂuence on the quench dynamics is less
obvious.

It is clearly possible to study these eﬀects in perturbation theory of the couplings
to the irrelevant operators, as in the case of the deformed initial state above. This
perturbation theory breaks down at late times. Here we take a diﬀerent approach,
which agrees with perturbation theory at low orders. However, this approach works
only for operators that are descendants of the identity, i.e. polynomials of the stress

Quantum quenches in 1+1D CFT

tensor components and their derivatives. Here, for simplicity, we restrict to considering
the dimension 4 operators T 2, T
and T T . These are generated in almost any quantum
critical hamiltonian. T 2, T
break Lorentz invariance, they are always generated in a
lattice model, their space integrals commute with the hamiltonian, and they preserve the
integrability of the model. T T preserves relativistic invariance, but introduces right-left
scattering and does not commute with the conformal hamiltonian, and generally makes
the theory non-integrable.

ﬁelds of the same product in the pure CFT at shifted values of the arguments

(cid:104)O(wj, ¯wj)(cid:105)SCF T +δS = E[(cid:104)O( ˜wj, ¯˜wj)(cid:105)SCF T ] .
where E[·] stands for the average over the gaussian ﬁelds.

We are ﬁnally ready to apply these ideas to the quench problem. Given that a
j = xj + tj + 2iτ0,

point (xj, tj) in Minkowski space is mapped to wj = xj − tj, ¯wj = w(cid:48)

on the cylinder, the eﬀect of the coordinate shift in light-cone coordinates is

d˜x+ = dx+ + δ¯g dx− ,

d˜x− = dx− + δg dx+ .

(55)

In the shifted coordinates the correlations have to be evaluated in the pure CFT,
in which signals propagate with speed v = 1. The left- and right-moving null geodesics
are d˜x+ = 0 and d˜x− = 0, that the original coordinates read

dx+ = −δ¯g dx− ,

dx− = −δgdx+ .

(56)

There are several consequences of this change of coordinate. The ﬁrst one is that,
given that (cid:104)T(cid:105) and (cid:104)T(cid:105) are both non-vanishing, δg and δ¯g have non-zero expectation
values (from (50) at the saddle-point (cid:104)δg(cid:105) = (cid:104)ξ(cid:105) = −(µ + λ)(cid:104)T(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0). Neglecting
ﬂuctuations, the null geodesics are dt = ±(1 + 2(cid:104)δg(cid:105))dx, so the average velocity of
propagation is renormalised. Since (cid:104)T(cid:105) = (cid:104)T(cid:105) < 0 in the initial state (and thereafter),
(cid:104)δg(cid:105) and (cid:104)δ¯g(cid:105) are both positive if µ + λ > 0, and so the speed is reduced. It may be
argued that this corresponds to an attractive interaction.

The second eﬀect is a diﬀusive broadening of the horizon. In order to show this,

In order to properly cure the UV behaviour, we have to use the fact that the horizon in
the pure CFT has a width O(τ0). Deﬁning then the mean x− coordinate of the horizon
by the random variable

X−(x+) = (4τ0)

this has variance

(cid:104)X−(x+)2(cid:105) = (λ/4τ0)x+ .
This shows that the eﬀect of T 2 and T
is to diﬀusively broaden the horizon to a width
O((λt/τ0)1/2). However, since this is smaller than t, the horizon remains well-deﬁned.
The T T term does not contribute to this eﬀect.

(59)

It can be shown that this eﬀectively ﬂuctuating metric leads to modiﬁcation of
correlation lengths, consistent with that found from perturbation theory to lowest order.
In a ﬁnite volume, it also leads to a progressive broadening and attenuation of the
revivals (cf. Sec. 2.10).

We ﬁnally discuss the eﬀects of higher orders in λ and µ, as well as higher order
descendants T (k) of the stress tensor (this can be described by a coupling to a random
metric with non-gaussian correlations, that are not expected to change the overall picture

so that the metric is

this corresponds to non-zero curvature R ∝

In fact, LL
and RR scatterings are equivalent to a coordinate change x± → ˜x± and cannot
introduce a curvature leading only to broadening of the horizon, possibly non-gaussian.
Instead, strong negative curvature eﬀects might lead to other eﬀects such as the chaotic
divergence of geodesics which are very diﬃcult to analyse quantitatively.

It should be interesting to extend our analysis of the non-integrable T T perturbation
of the CFT to other situations, for example an inhomogeneous quench (cf. Sec. 4.1),
where there are non-zero energy currents, or to the steady state currents set up by a
non-zero temperature gradient (see [183] and [184]). Recently this problem has been
addressed from a diﬀerent point of view [185].

3. CFT approach to local quantum quenches

In a local quantum quench the initial state diﬀers only locally (i.e.
in a small ﬁnite
region) from the ground state of the model. Although there is such a small (indeed
inﬁnitesimal compared to the ground state energy) excess of energy in the initial state,
this has a very large eﬀect which may be interpreted as a manifestation of the famous
Anderson orthogonality catastrophe [186]. Obviously the details of the many-body
dynamics depend on the way the local perturbation to the ground state is performed.
One case is treated by means of CFT in a particularly simple fashion [187] and it is the
so called cut and glue protocol. It works as follows: we physically cut a one dimensional
quantum system (e.g. a spin chain) at the boundaries between two subsystems A and
B, and prepare a state where the two individual pieces are in their respective ground
states. In this state A and B are unentangled, and its energy diﬀers from that of the
ground state by only a ﬁnite amount. At time −t we glue the two pieces and let the
system evolve up to t = 0. Clearly the method outlined previously for global quenches
does not apply because the initial state is not translational invariant.

There is however an alternative and convenient way to represent the corresponding
density matrix in terms of a path integral. The physical cut of the pre-quench

hamiltonian corresponds to having two slits parallel to the imaginary time axis, one
starting from −∞ up to τ1 = − − it (the time when the two pieces have been joined),
and another from τ2 =  − it to +∞. This plane with the two slits is shown on
the left of Fig. 5. We introduced the regularisation factor  in order to have a ﬁnite
distance between the two slits (in analogy to the requirement of a ﬁnite strip in the
global quench). The physical operators are inserted at imaginary time τ = 0. However,
for computational simplicity we consider the translated geometry (by it) with two cuts
starting at ±i and operators inserted at imaginary time τ . This should be considered
real during the course of the computation, and only at the end can be analytically
continued to it. As shown on the right of Fig. 5, the z-plane is mapped into the half-
plane Re w > 0 by the conformal mapping

+ 1

(61)

On the two slits in the z plane (and so on the imaginary axis in the w one) appropriate
conformal boundary conditions compatible with the cut must be imposed (e.g. Dirichlet
for a free boson).

As already stated, in a local quantum quench, there is only a small excess of energy
compared to the ground-state. Consequently, only low lying excited states are expected
to be populated after the quench. When a quantum system such as a spin chain is
eﬀectively described at low energy and in equilibrium by a CFT, we then expect that
even the dynamics following a quantum quench is correctly captured by CFT when
time and distances are much larger than any microscopical scale. This includes also the
regulator  introduced above. Thus, as a fundamental diﬀerence compared to global
quenches, we expect the results for local quenches to be universal and valid for any
system whose low energy spectrum is captured by CFT.

3.1. Entanglement between the two halves

The ﬁrst question we consider is how the entanglement entropy between the two parts
in which the system was divided before the quench grows in time. As we shall see, this
is obtained by a very simple calculation and gives very important information about the
quench. As already discussed in Sec. 2.5, the moments of the reduced density matrix
Tr ρn
A transform like a one-point function of twist operator of scaling dimension xn given
by Eq. (15). In the w plane this one-point function is ˜cn[2Rew1/a]−xn (with ˜cn non-
universal constants and a the UV cutoﬀ such as a lattice spacing). Thus in the z plane
at the point z1 = (0, iτ ) we have

i.e. the leading long time behaviour is only determined by the central charge of the
theory. Eq. (64) is reminiscent of the ground state result for an interval of length (cid:96)
[44, 45], but the prefactor c/3 has a diﬀerent origin since in this case there is only one
boundary point between the two subsystems A and B.
Indeed there is a factor two
compared to what one could naively expect and this follows from having introduced an
new length scale .

This long-time ln t behaviour has been analytically and numerically observed many
diﬀerent models in the cut and glue scenario [188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193]. Furthermore
the ln t growth is more generally valid also when the two halves are not joined in a
translational invariant manner. For example for free fermionic model joined with a
bond defect there is a logarithmic growth with a renormalised prefactor [194, 195],
while in interacting models the prefactor depends upon the relevance (in RG sense) of
the impurity bond [196].

3.2. Entanglement of a de-centered subsystem

We now consider the entanglement entropy of the region r > (cid:96) with the rest of the
system. In this case Tr ρn
A is equivalent to the one-point function in the plane z at the
point z2 = (cid:96) + iτ (see Fig. 5). Using the conformal mapping (5), analytically continuing
and taking t, (cid:96) (cid:29)  one ﬁnally get [32]

t < (cid:96) ,

t > (cid:96) .

(65)

The interpretation of this result is direct. Quasi-particle excitations produced by the
gluing at r = 0 take a time t = (cid:96) to arrive at the boundary between A and B and only at
that time start modifying their entanglement. Note that for t (cid:29) (cid:96) we recover Eq. (64).
The time independent value for t < (cid:96) is the entanglement of a ﬁnite interval of length (cid:96)
in the half-line [44]. The singularity at t = (cid:96) is smoothed on a scale .

In Ref.

[187] also the entanglement of a ﬁnite interval (both on one side or
across the cutting point) has been derived. We do not review these results here,
but refer the interested reader to the original literature. Further results for more
complicated bipartitions have been derived in [197]. Also the entanglement between non
complementary parts (quantiﬁed by the negativity) has been considered in [198, 199].

3.3. One-point function of a primary operator

The one-point function of a primary ﬁeld in the half-plane Re w > 0 is (cid:104)Φ(w)(cid:105) =
b [2Re w]−xΦ, where xΦ is the scaling dimension of the ﬁeld and AΦ

amplitude in appearing Sec. 2.2. In this section, we ﬁx the UV cutoﬀ a to 1. Using the

b

mapping (61) we can obtain the time dependence of the one-point function of a primary
operator. At the point r, after continuing to real time we have

(cid:19)xΦ

(cid:104)Φ(r, t)(cid:105) =

t < r ,

t > r .

(66)

Thus for short times the correlation takes its initial value, until the eﬀect of the joining

arrives at time t = r when it decays for t (cid:29) r like t−2xΦ (note that this exponent is

twice the boundary one). This prediction has been explicitly veriﬁed in free fermionic
models [200, 201].

3.4. Two point function of a primary operator

In order to calculate the two-point function of primaries (cid:104)Φ(r1, t)Φ(r2, t)(cid:105) after a global
quantum quench, one should start from the general scaling form for this correlator in
the half-plane (10), use the map (61) and ﬁnally take the limit t, r1, r2, r12 (cid:29) . The
algebra is quite long, but elementary. We then refer for details to the original literature
[187] and we report only the result here.

There are three regimes for the time dependence of this correlation. Without loss
of generality we can assume r1 > 0 and |r2| < r1. For large times t > r1 (and hence
t > |r2|) we have

,

(67)

(cid:104)Φ(r1, t)Φ(r2, t)(cid:105) =

1

|r1 − r2|2xΦ

i.e. the correlation function relaxes to its ground-state value. This can be understood
by the fact that the small excess of energy introduced by the defect in the quasi-particle
picture is pushed far away for large time.

The behaviour for |r2| < t < r1 is more complicated and can be written as

(cid:20) (r1 + r2)(r2 + t)

(cid:21)xΦ

(cid:18) 2r1(r2 + t)



(r1 − r2)(r1 − t)

(cid:104)Φ(r1, t)Φ(r2, t)(cid:105) =
For t < |r2| we see that the gluing did not reach any of the two points and the correlation
keeps its initial value which depends on whether the two points are on the same or on
diﬀerent side of the cutting point. Also this prediction for the two-point function has
been explicitly veriﬁed in free fermionic models [200].

3.5. The return amplitude

As ﬁrstly pointed out in [202], the return amplitude‡ (cid:104)ψ0|ψ(t)(cid:105) after a local quantum
quench in a CFT display a universal behaviour for large time. Let us consider

F(t) ≡ − ln|(cid:104)ψ0|ψ(t)(cid:105)| = − ln|(cid:104)ψ0|e

−iHt|ψ0(cid:105)|,

sometimes also called bipartite logarithmic ﬁdelity [202]. In imaginary time (and having
introduced the regulator ), F(τ ) is nothing but the free energy of the statistical

Quantum quenches in 1+1D CFT

32

mechanical system deﬁned in the geometry shown in left of Fig. 5. In a CFT this is
obtained by computing the expectation value of the stress energy tensor in this geometry
(which is easily determined by using its transformation [203] under the conformal
mapping (61)) that is the derivative of the free energy wrt τ . The desired free energy is
then obtained by integrating this expression. The details of this calculation are reported
in [202, 204] with ﬁnal result

This prediction has been accurately checked against exact numerical computations for
free fermionic models [204].

3.6. Decoupled ﬁnite interval

A natural question is how all the results derived above change when we cut and glue
not half-line by a ﬁnite interval of length (cid:96). It is straightforward to have a path integral
for the density matrix: we only need to have two pairs of slits for −∞ to −i and from
i to +i∞ at distance (cid:96). However, it becomes diﬃcult to treat this case analytically.

In Ref. [187] we preferred to treat the similar case in which an interval of length (cid:96)
is embedded in half-line and start from the boundary. In this case we have only one pair
of slits at (cid:96). The inverse of the conformal mapping from this geometry to the half-plane
can be written analytically but cannot be inverted. Then, by making some physical
motivated approximations on this mapping between, it has been shown that for t < 2(cid:96)
the one-point function of a primary ﬁeld should be given by [187]

(cid:104)Φ(iτ )(cid:105) =

1

t sin(πt/2(cid:96))

.

(72)

This can be also used to derive the entanglement entropy between the initially decoupled
interval and the rest of the system, obtaining [187]

(73)

In the case of an initially decoupled slit of length (cid:96) in an inﬁnite chain Eq. (73) is
expected to be still valid with the replacements 2(cid:96) → (cid:96) and c/6 → c/3 as follows from
a simple analysis [190]. The validity of this has been carefully tested numerically for
the XX chain in Ref. [190], ﬁnding very good agreement for all t < (cid:96). In Ref. [193] a
more complicated kind of defects has been investigated, and the results always agree
with Eq. (73) when describing a conformal hamiltonian.

3.7. Finite systems

Dubail and St´ephan [204] extended ingeniously the results of the previous subsections
to the case in which at time t = 0 we cut and glue two ﬁnite segments (of lengths LA

and LB with L = LA + LB) in their respective ground states. The starting point of
the problem is indeed easy, one should just consider the geometry on the left of Fig. 5,
but with the left and right sides having ﬁnite lengths LA and LB instead of being semi-
inﬁnite. Assuming that all the boundary conditions (i.e. at the four ends of the two
segments) are all the same, the physical quantities can be computed by mapping this
geometry (called double pants in [204]) to the half-plane. However, ﬁnding out this
mapping analytically is generically prohibitive, except in few easy circumstances.

One of the relevant easy cases is when LA = LB = L/2, for which the mapping can
be found analytically [204]. We refer the readers interested in the details of calculations
to the original reference [204] and we state only the ﬁnal results. The entanglement
entropy between the two initially disconnect halves evolves like

Indeed this formula was previously guessed on the basis of numerical simulations
[193, 200]. It is also possible to treat the more general case when the bipartition does

and SA(t) is periodic with period L. As a check, in the limit t, (cid:96) (cid:28) L one recovers (65).
Along similar lines it is also possible to calculate the the return amplitude (69),

Notice that all the above results are nothing but the those in an inﬁnite geometry,
where t and (cid:96) have been replaced by their “chord counterparts” L

L .
As noticed in [204], this simple relation is usually standard in CFT, but breaks down
as soon as the quench is not located exactly in the middle of the strip.

Another important feature of the ﬁnite size systems is that all CFT results are
periodic in time with period L. This clearly reﬂects the commensurability of the
spectrum of the CFT and the fundamental fact that for the particular type of quench
we are looking at, only the identity and its descendants have non-zero overlaps with the
initial state [204]. When comparing with the results of lattice models whose scaling limit
is described by a CFT, the commensurability of the spectrum is spoiled at order L−2
and hence this periodic behaviour is expected to be visible for times such as vt (cid:28) L/a
[204] (with v being the sound velocity). Indeed in Fig. 6 we report the numerical results
in [204] for both the entanglement entropy an the return amplitude which display this
periodic behaviour. Indeed for local quenches, we expect only the lower energy part of
the spectrum to be signiﬁcantly excited and this is correctly described by CFT. This is
drastically diﬀerent compared to global quenches in which high-energy excitations with
non-universal scaling behaviour are excited and lattice eﬀects are much more important.

If one is interested in geometries where the cut is not in the middle of the chain
(LA (cid:54)= LB), the problem is much more complicated, and a full explicit solution is
prohibitive. However, in [204] it was shown that for the return amplitude the diﬃculty
can be circumvented by performing the analytic continuation semi-numerically and this
is suﬃcient to provide the exact answer in the limit of t, LA, LB (cid:29) . For example, in
the case when LB = ∞ and LA arbitrary, the ﬁnal result can be written as [204]

(cid:18)

(cid:20)

(cid:19)

The above equation can be solved numerically for b(t) and successively can be injected
in (77) to have the time dependence of the return amplitude. A similar analysis can be
repeated for arbitrary LB, but the ﬁnal result is even more cumbersome to be written
down and we refer the reader to Ref. [204]. The entanglement entropy turns out to be
much more complicated in the asymmetric geometries. In Ref.
[204] only the case of
aspect ratio x = LA/L = 1/3 was considered, but the ﬁnal formula is too complicate to
be reported here. In Ref. [204] all these results have been compared to the numerical
solution of free fermionic models, ﬁnding excellent agreement with the CFT predictions
(in the proper regime of applicability) for all aspect ratios.

3.8. Measuring entanglement using a local quench

The possibility of measuring experimentally the entanglement entropy of a many-body
quantum systems has longly been a fascinating topic, made very diﬃcult by the fact

that it is an intrinsically non-local quantity. A few proposals in the literature are based
on local quench protocols which we are going to brieﬂy mention here, although the ﬁrst
entanglement measurement in cold atomic systems is based on diﬀerent ideas [205].

The ﬁrst idea due to Klich and Levitov [206] was to relate the entanglement after
a local quench between two half-chains to the distribution of non-interacting particles
passing through the contact between them. The main result of
[206] is to establish a
relation between the cumulants Ck of particle number ﬂuctuations and the entanglement
entropy of the two-halves of non-interacting fermions which reads

(cid:88)

SA =

Ck, αk =

(cid:110) (2π)k|Bk|, k even ,

where Bm are Bernoulli numbers. The quantum noise generated by a switching on of
the contact at t = 0 is characterised by gaussian current ﬂuctuations (Cm(cid:54)=2 = 0), with
variance growing with time as C2 = 1
π2 ln t. Combined with Eq. (79) this gives entropy
SA ∼ (1/3) ln t which is the result after a local quantum quench (64). As pointed out
in [192], it is not clear how to generalise this idea to interacting models and to model
without a conserved current.
It is worth mention that relations similar to (79) have
been derived also for the entanglement entropy of a ﬁnite interval in equilibrium [207].
A diﬀerent way of measuring R´enyi entanglement entropies of integer order has
been proposed in Ref. [208]. It is based on a particular local quench and it should be
valid for an arbitrary system. The details of the proposal are probably too technical
to be reported entirely here and so we describe only the main concepts. First of all
it is convenient to introduce n copies (replicas) of the original system and, following
[211], deﬁne the swap operator Πn that maps each j-th replica to the (j + 1)-th one
in the subsystem A, while on B acts as the identity.
It is then clear [212] that the
expectation value of Πn on the ground state of the n-copy model with Hamiltonian
H (i.e. H(cid:104)0|Πn|0(cid:105)H) is the desired n-th moment of the reduced density matrix Trρn
A.
n HΠn. The hamiltonians H(cid:48) and H are isospectral and
Let us now deﬁne H(cid:48) = Π−1
|0(cid:105)H(cid:48) = Π−1
n |0(cid:105)H is the ground state of H(cid:48). Hence, thinking of H → H(cid:48) as a quantum
quench, the modulus squared of H(cid:104)0|Πn|0(cid:105)H is the ﬁdelity P0 = |H(cid:48)(cid:104)0|0(cid:105)H|2. Obviously
the ﬁdelity itself is not directly measurable, but it is useful to think at the action of Πn
on the replicated model. For example, for n = 2, the action of Πn amounts to cut the
two lines at the boundary points between A and B and to join at those points the two
replicas (see [208] for more details and for arbitrary order of the R´enyi entropy n) and
this is nothing but a particular local quench, usually called quantum switch. The ﬁnal
argument of [208] is that, in a system close to a quantum critical point described by a
CFT, the measurable probability P (E) of ﬁnding the system in a low-lying excited state
of energy E is given by P0 (i.e. the desired R´enyi entropy) times a calculable factor
which depends on the relative geometry of A and B.

Later, Abanin and Demler [209] pointed out that the overlap P0 can be accessed
by introducing a weak tunneling between the two states of the quantum switch, leading
to an hybridisation of the two ground states. Consequently, measuring Rabi oscillations

between the two ground states would give direct access to P0. At the same time, in [210]
the action of Πn was related to the evolution of the parity number after a particular
quench for two replicas of a bosonic chain.

4. Brief review of other quench protocols

In this last section we brieﬂy review some generalisations of the already reported
quenches which can be treated either with conformal ﬁeld theory or with methods
similar to those reviewed above. It is impossible to provide an account of all the aspects
of quantum quenches in ﬁeld theories and to their applications. There are already
excellent reviews on some aspects of the subject [35, 36, 37, 38] and a few more are
present in this special volume. The goal of the following examples is just to show how
the imaginary time formalism developed above can ﬁnd further applications.

Two diﬀerent non-equilibrium situations in conformal ﬁeld theory will be treated
in other reviews in this volume and for this reasons will not be considered here. These
are the quantum quench within the Luttinger model [213] (a case which includes the
possibility that also the initial state is the ground state of a CFT with algebraically
decaying correlations) and the real time transport governed by CFT [184].

4.1. Inhomogeneous initial states

One natural question going beyond the results in the previous sections is to ask what
happens when an initial state with an extensive excess of energy (as in a global quench)
is not translational invariant (as in a local quench) and the post-quench Hamiltonian
is always conformal invariant. This is of particular relevance to understand several
experimental situations, such as the presence of a harmonic conﬁnement in cold atoms,
voltage diﬀerences in quantum wires, and many more.

In Ref.

4.1.1. Smoothly varying initial state.
[46], the case was considered when the
initial state is of the form (4) but with τ0 being a slowly varying function of the
space coordinate. This was motivated by the fact that being (in the proper limits)
τ0 proportional to the correlation length (inverse of the mass) in the initial state, such
case should mimic an initial space varying mass. A space dependent τ0(x) corresponds
in imaginary time to a 2D strip with variable width. This variable width strip can
be transformed into a standard strip by a conformal transformation w → z = g(w).
Then the transformation law of correlation functions of (primary) operators under such
mappings will allow us to derive the corresponding expressions using already known
results in the strip. This problem is mathematically well posed, but it usually diﬃcult
to solve analytically for an arbitrary τ0(x). There is however one case that can be
treated in a general fashion, i.e. the limit in which the transformation is inﬁnitesimal,
that is τ0(x) = τ0 + h(x) varies only slightly in comparison with some average value, i.e.
h(x) (cid:28) τ0. It turns out that the behaviour of physical quantities for large times and

separations is determined by the asymptotic behaviour of the transformation for large
|z|; since the initial distribution h(x) is bounded, we can distinguish two important
cases: either it tends to the same value as x → ±∞ or to diﬀerent values for each
limit and the two can be understood just by considering a bump or a step distribution
localised at the origin.

A ﬁrst non-trivial diﬀerence compared to the homogeneous case is that there is a
net energy ﬂow, given by the value of the 01 component of the stress energy tensor. For
inﬁnitesimal h(x) this can be computed exactly, obtaining [46]

i.e. the energy ﬂows in a wave-like fashion. Correlation functions and entanglement
entropy can be also calculated exactly. We refer the interested reader to Ref.
[46] for
all the results and we report only the ﬁnal result for the entanglement entropy of the

4.1.2. Domain-wall initial state without conservation laws. A diﬀerent inhomogeneous
situation has been considered in [214]. In this case the initial state is of the form (4) to
the left and to the right of a given point (let us say 0), but the two halves correspond to
diﬀerent boundary conditions with a changing operator between them. For example, for
the simple case of the Ising CFT, this includes the case where all the spins on the left are
aligned in one direction and all the spins on the right are in the opposite direction. The
resulting time evolution is easily understood on general considerations: for |x| > t the
two halves evolve independently since one does not causally feel the presence of the other,
while inside the light-cone |x| < t there is a non trivial evolution with spin transport
and complicated correlation functions. Many results can be derived by analytically
continuing known correlation functions for strips with diﬀerent boundary conditions,
but again for lack of space we refer the interested reader to the original reference [214].

4.1.3. Domain-wall initial state with a conserved U (1) current. We now discuss a
quench which has features between a global and a local one. This can be realised in
models that possess a U (1) symmetry such us XXZ spin-chains or models of spinless
fermions. Let us for example take two uniformly ﬁlled half-chains of spinless fermions in
their respective ground-states, but with a diﬀerent densities. At time t = 0 the two are
connected as in a local quench to form an inﬁnite chain. There are clearly particle and
energy currents ﬂowing from one edge to the other and the dynamics take place only

inside a light-cone propagating from the joining point, because outside of it the system
is locally in an eigenstate. (For equal ﬁlling, this is nothing but the local quench of the
previous section without energy current.) Another interesting and slightly simpler limit
is the case in which half-chain is prepared with ﬁlling 1 and the other half 0, i.e. in spin
language there is a domain wall between two fully and oppositely polarised half-chains.
This quench protocol is studied since long time and numerous numerical and analytic
results are available from diﬀerent techniques [215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222],
especially in the free fermions case when calculations are rather elementary (see e.g.
[222]).

Although the large number of works on the subject, a ﬁeld theoretical description
of the problem in imaginary time has been only recently proposed for the case of free
fermions [223]. Following the logic introduced for global quenches, it is rather natural
to expect that the imaginary time version of this quench problem is given by the strip
geometry depicted on the left of Fig. 7, in which the two boundaries are domain-wall
states. Unfortunately the analogy with global quenches ﬁnishes here because those
states have nothing to do with conformally invariant boundary states. The idea of Ref.
[223] proceeds as follows. At imaginary time y = −R the degrees of freedom are frozen
for any x. For larger imaginary times, the particles are released and can hop to left
or to the right. So, as soon as y > −R, a small region around x = 0 appears, where
there are density ﬂuctuations, with non trivial correlations. The strip is symmetric for
reﬂection respect to the real axis. In the scaling limit x, y, R → ∞ with x/R and y/R
constant, the exact shape of the ﬂuctuating region is the disc of radius R centred at the
origin [223], see Fig. 7.

The main problem now is to understand the ﬁeld theory inside this disc. Clearly,
it should be massless. Presumably there should exists also a single theory both in the
interior and in the exterior of the disc, with a non-vanishing mass only outside the disc.
For the case of a free fermion, this ﬁeld theory must be a massless Dirac fermion (in
more general cases we expect a compactiﬁed boson/Luttinger model), but the action
is non-trivial in order to describe a ﬂuctuating region. The non-triviality of the action
comes from having a non ﬂat measure inside the ﬂuctuating region, a metric that can

Quantum quenches in 1+1D CFT

39

be ﬁxed by taking the continuing limit of the hopping model, see for details [223].

4.1.4. More general local quenches in CFT. The cut and glue protocol is only one of
the many ways to generate a local quench. More general situations in spin-chains or gas
models are such that a local density or phase perturbation is generated locally and then
the following time-evolution is studied, see e.g. [224, 225, 226, 227]. In general it is not
simple to model these situations in ﬁeld theories. In Ref. [228] it has been considered
the case in which this local perturbation is obtained by acting with a given conformal
local operator at some point. It turns out that the evolution of the entanglement entropy
depends on the considered operator in a calculable manner (see for more details also
[229]).

Insertions of relevant operators have also been used in [230] for a very diﬀerent
kind of global quench. There, it was proposed a particular boundary state on the strip
of width 2τ0 to mimic the split momentum quench in the famous quantum Newton
cradle [2]. A pair of chiral and antichiral vertex operators have been inserted on the
boundary of a compactiﬁed free boson with Dirichlet conditions. The opposite-chirality
vertex operators act to excite the ground state in analogy to the experimental setup
of two excited oppositely moving bosonic clouds. The results found with this approach
qualitative resemble the momentum distribution function measured in the experiment.

4.2. Higher dimensions.

The imaginary time formalism used extensively for (1+1) dimensional CFT in Sec. 2
is not limited to one dimension. As already exploited in [25], the real-time evolution
of a d-dimensional quantum system can always be interpreted as a boundary problem
in d + 1 dimensions in imaginary time. In this case, instead of a strip we have a slab
of width 2τ0. Unfortunately, this is not generically very insightful because it is very
complicated to solve ﬁeld theories in conﬁned geometries in arbitrary dimensions, even
conformal invariant ones, since we do not have at disposal the powerful tools of conformal
mapping (aka the conformal group is ﬁnite dimensional).
However, mean ﬁeld models can be exactly solved.

In [32] the case of a critical
mean-ﬁeld evolution was considered and one of the most remarkable results was to
show that the order parameter after the quench can display persistent non harmonic
oscillations depending on the initial state. This ﬁnding was generalised to arbitrary
massive post-quench mean ﬁeld hamiltonian in [231]. This general solution allowed
for the reconstruction of a non-equilibrium mean-ﬁeld dynamical phase diagram (in
function of pre- and post-quench masses) which closely resembles the results obtained
in real time for speciﬁc bosonic and fermionic mean ﬁeld models [232, 233, 234]. Taking
into account ﬂuctuations beyond mean ﬁeld is a very diﬃcult problem which is still at
a very embryonic level, see e.g. [235, 236, 237, 238, 239] as relevant manuscripts on the
subject.

Finally it must be mentioned once again that in higher dimensions many results

Quantum quenches in 1+1D CFT

40

are available from holographic methods (see e.g. [116, 117, 121, 122, 240, 241]) and free
ﬁeld theories [32, 242, 243].
