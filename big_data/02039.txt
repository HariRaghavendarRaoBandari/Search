The study of interacting spin systems is of
fundamental importance for modern condensed
matter physics. On frustrated lattices, magnetic
exchange interactions cannot be simultaneously
satisﬁed, and often give rise to competing exotic
ground states1.
The frustrated 2D Shastry-
Sutherland lattice2 realized by SrCu2(BO3)2
3 is
an important test to our understanding of quan-
tum magnetism. It was constructed to have an
exactly solvable 2-spin dimer singlet ground state
within a certain range of exchange parameters
and frustration. While the exact dimer state and
the antiferromagnetic order at both ends of the
phase diagram are well known, the ground state
and spin correlations in the intermediate frus-
tration range have been widely debated2–12. We
report here the ﬁrst experimental identiﬁcation
of the conjectured plaquette singlet intermediate
phase in SrCu2(BO3)2. It is observed by inelas-
tic neutron scattering after pressure tuning at
21.5 kbar. This gapped plaquette singlet state
with strong 4-spin correlations leads to a tran-
sition to an ordered N´eel state above 40 kbar,
which can realize a deconﬁned quantum critical
point.

In the ﬁeld of quantum magnetism, geometrically frus-

trated lattices generally imply major diﬃculties in an-
alytical and numerical studies. For very few partic-
ular topologies however,
it has been shown that the
ground state, at least, can be calculated exactly as for
the Majumdar-Gosh model13 that solves the J1-J2 zig-
zag chain when J1 = 2J2. In 2D, the Shastry-Sutherland
model2 consisting of an orthogonal dimer network of spin
S=1/2 was developed in order to be exactly solvable.
For an inter-dimer J(cid:48) to intra-dimer J exchange ratio
α ≡ J(cid:48)/J ≤ 0.5 the ground state is a product of singlets
on the strong bond J. Numerical calculations have fur-
ther shown that this remains valid up to α ≤∼ 0.7 and for
small values of 3D couplings J(cid:48)(cid:48) between dimer layers. At
the other end, for ∼ 0.9 ≤ α ≤ ∞ the system approaches
the well known 2D square lattice, which is antiferromag-
netically (AFM) ordered, albeit with signiﬁcant quantum
ﬂuctuations that are believed to include resonating sin-
glet correlations resulting in fractional excitations14. The
phase diagram of the Shastry-Sutherland model, both
with and without applied magnetic ﬁeld, has been in-
tensively studied by numerous theoretical and numerical
approaches3. In the presence of magnetic ﬁeld, magne-
tization plateaus at fractional values of the saturation
magnetization corresponding to Mott insulator phases of
dimer states, as well as possible superﬂuid and super-
solid phases have been extensively studied6,15,16. At zero
ﬁeld, the main unsolved issue is the existence and nature

of an intermediate phase for ∼ 0.7 ≤ α ≤∼ 0.9. A va-
riety of quantum phases and transitions between them
have been predicted depending on the theoretical tech-
nique used: a direct transition from dimer singlet phase
to AFM order2,5,6, or an intermediate phase with heli-
cal order4, columnar dimers10, valence bond crystal11 or
resonating valence bond (RVB) plaquettes8,9. Recent re-
sults indicate that a plaquette singlet phase is favored3,17.
From such a phase, which would have an additional Ising-
type order parameter, a subsequent transition to AFM
order could provide a realisation of the so far elusive de-
conﬁned quantum critical point18.

The compound strontium copper borate SrCu2(BO3)2
is the only known realization of the Shastry-Sutherland
model with S=1/2 spins3 and has thus triggered con-
siderable attention in the ﬁeld of quantum magnetism.
The spectrum of SrCu2(BO3)2 exhibits an almost dis-
persionless ∆=3 meV gap, and a bound-state of two
triplets (BT) forms at EBT (cid:39)5 meV. The unusual size
and dispersionless nature of the gap is an eﬀect of the
frustration which prevents triplets from hopping up to
sixth order3. The estimated exchange parameters in the
material J ∼ 85 K and α = 0.6353 or J ∼ 71 K and
α = 0.6037 place the compound close to an interesting
regime α ∼ 0.7 where correlations may change dramati-
cally at a critical point.

A precious mean to tune a quantum magnet across a
quantum phase transition is the application of hydro-
static pressure as it directly modiﬁes the atomic dis-
tances and bridging angles, such as Cu-O-Cu and thus
the magnetic exchange integrals. Quantum phase transi-
tions were successfully discovered in dimer magnets upon
application of pressure19. However high pressure mea-
surements remain technically challenging.
In the case
of SrCu2(BO3)2 magnetic susceptibility20 and ESR21 to
moderate pressures (p≤12 kbar) indicate a softening of
the gap, while the combined eﬀect of pressure and ﬁeld
was measured by susceptibility and NMR22. In the lat-
ter case magnetic order occurring at 24 kbar and 7 T
on a fraction of the dimers was proposed. In an X-ray
diﬀraction investigation the temperature dependence of
the lattice parameters was analysed as an indirect proxy
for the singlet triplet gap leading to the suggestion that
it closes at 20 kbar23. At even higher pressures neutron
and X-ray diﬀraction experiments observed a transition
above 45 kbar from the ambient I¯42M tetragonal space
group to monoclinic24–26.

Here we present neutron spectroscopy results, which
directly determine the pressure dependence of the gap
and through the dynamic structure factor allows us to
address the nature of the correlations. Figure 1 summa-
rize the phase diagram of SrCu2(BO3)2, we determined
in this study. The exact dimer phase survives up to
16 kbar. The gap decreases from 3 meV to 2 meV, but
does not vanish. At 21.5 kbar we discover experimen-
tally a new, intermediate phase. We identify it by its
inelastic neutron scattering spectrum as the formation
of 4-spin plaquette singlets. Above 40 kbar and below

FIG. 1. Phase diagram of SrCu2(BO3)2 as a function of pres-
sure and temperature, including excitation energies. The blue
region is the dimer phase, the red region the newly identiﬁed
plaquette phase, and the green region the antiferromagnetic
phases where Q=(1,0,0) magnetic Bragg peaks, indicated by
green squares, are observed only above 40 kbar. Circles are
the triplet gap energy ∆ at Q=(2,0,L), diamonds are the cor-
responding 2-triplet bound state energy EBT and the star
is a new low energy excitation observed at Q=(1,0,1). The
magenta line shows the tetragonal to monoclinic structural
transition25. The corresponding monoclinic space groups are
indicated26,27. The dashed line in the plaquette phase is the
extrapolated energy gap using Ref. 8. The insets depict the
corresponding ground states. All the experimental points are
from this study.

117 K we ﬁnd by neutron diﬀraction that AFM order
appears while the compound likely still has tetragonal
symmetry with orthogonal dimers. Above ∼45 kbar, a
structural distortion takes place and the symmetry be-
comes monoclinic, implying non-orthogonal dimers25,26.
SrCu2(BO3)2 is magnetically ordered after the distortion,
but can no longer be described appropriately by the orig-
inal Shastry-Sutherland model. The transition from 2-
spin dimer to 4-spin plaquette singlets appears to be of
ﬁrst order, whereas the transition from the plaquette to
the AFM phase could be of second order and concomi-
tant with the continious closure of the plaquette gap or
of ﬁrst order8,17,28,29.

To allow a quantitative comparison to theoretical pre-
dictions we establish the pressure dependence of the ex-
change parameters Jχ(p), J(cid:48)
χ(p), and α(p) by measur-
ing magnetic susceptibility χ(p, T ) and ﬁtting it using
20 sites exact-diagonalization. The peak in susceptibility
shifts to lower temperature as pressure increases up to
10 kbar (Figure 2a). This suggest a reduction of the spin
gap. We parametrise the pressure dependence of J and
J(cid:48) by linear ﬁts (Figure 2b). J has the larger slope so
that α increases with pressure. Having established α(p)
we see that the critical pressure lying between 16 kbar
and 21.5 kbar corresponds to 0.66 < αc < 0.68, in good
agreement with theoretical predictions3,11,17.

A selection from the neutron spectra leading to the

phase diagram are summarised in Figure 3. Up to 16 kbar
an essentially Q-independent linear decrease of the gap
energy is observed (Figures 1 and 3a). The measure-
ment of the dispersion and of the structure factor in
that pressure range shows that the spin system is still
in its original ”exact dimer” ground-state with a re-
duced energy scale of the exchange parameters. The
dispersion increases slightly with pressure (not shown),
which can be understood by the increase of α5.
In-
terestingly, the bound triplet energy EBT softens twice
as fast, implying that the triplet binding energy, δ =
2∆ − EBT =1.19(2) meV, remains pressure independent.
This results in the unusual situation that extrapolating
the softenings, the bound triplet would reach zero en-
ergy before the single triplet, and hence that, before that
point, exciting a bound state of two triplets would cost
less energy than exciting one triplet.

SrCu2(BO3)2 enters a new quantum phase between 16
and 21.5 kbar, where a discontinuity in the gap soft-
ening occurs. The spectra at these two pressures for
Q=(1.5,0,1) (Figure 3b) and for (2,0,0) are extremely
similar and the gap energy ∆ (cid:39)2 meV remains un-
changed. The transition to a new quantum phase is fur-
ther asserted by a new type of excitation suddenly ap-
pearing at the higher pressure (Figure 3c). It is clearly
visible around 1 meV for Q=(1,0,1), (-1,0,1) and (1,0,1.5)
at 0.5 K and is not observed at 15 K, which proves the
magnetic origin. Figures 3e and 3f show the dispersion
and intensity of the two excitations along (1≤H≤2,0,1).
The excitation at 2 meV clearly displays a similar be-
haviour as that expected from the singlet-triplet gap ex-
citation in the exact dimer phase (given by the full lines)
and we thus keep labelling it ∆. The new low energy
excitation (LE) on the other hand is more dispersive,
∼0.4 meV in the measured momentum range, and has a
diﬀerent structure factor strongly peaking at Q=(1,0,1).
Another strong evidence for the similarity of ∆ and the
ambient pressure gap is given by the comparison of scans
at constant energy along (H,0,1) at 0 and 21.5 kbar in
Figure 3d. Except for the overall decrease in intensity,
the two scans are close to identical.

To interpret the appearance of a new excitation and
the observed momentum dependence of the dynamical
structure factors, it is illustrative to consider the sim-
pliﬁed case of an isolated 4-spin plaquette, described in
the Methods section, which has a singlet ground state
and shows two low lying excitations T1 and T2. The
structure factors of these excitations, summed over the
two possible ’full’ plaquette orientations (Figure 4a), are
shown in Figures 4b-c together with those of a ’void’ pla-
quette (Figures 4d-f) containing no diagonal bond. T1
has a structure factor peaking near Qhk=(Qh,Qk)=(1,0)
in the 2D geometry of SrCu2(BO3)2 for both full
and void plaquettes (Figure 4g). T2, however, has a
structure factor identical to that of an isolated dimer on
the diagonal bond only for the full plaquette (Figures 4c,
4f, and 4h). While an extended many-body calculation
would be needed for a fully quantitative comparison,
the isolated plaquette considered here displays the
main characteristics of the new intermediate pressure
phase: (1) a non-magnetic gapped ground state, (2) a
low energy triplet (LE) with structure factor peaking
at Qhk=(1,0), and (3) another low energy excitation
(∆) with structure factor identical to the singlet-triplet
transition in the exact dimer phase. We thus identify
the discovered phase as composed of 4-spin plaquette
singlets, with excitation LE corresponding to T1 and

To analyze further the interacting plaquette system,
we plot in Figure 4i the measured energies E/J vs. α
which enables a direct comparison between our results
and the calculations for the low- and high-energy RVB-
like plaquette excitations by Ref. 9, and columnar plaque-
tte block energy12. Experimental and calculated5 gap en-
ergies in the dimer phase are in excelent agreement. Be-
yond the transition, there is qualitative agreement for the
energy scales, in particular the observed energies of LE
and of ∆ for 21.5 kbar are close to the expected low- and
high-energy plaquette excitations of Ref. 9 for α = 0.68.

Our results can also explain the occurrence of mag-
netic ordering proposed by NMR measurements at
24 kbar and 7 T22:
the new spin S=1 excitation LE
being low in energy (0.5 meV), a 7 T ﬁeld is suﬃcient to
close the related gap and to obtain a magnetic ground
state. This ﬁeld-induced quantum critical point and
resulting phase will be related to the ﬁeld-induced BEC
physics observed in dimer singlet systems31, but could
reveal new phenomena due to the strong frustration in
the Shastry-Sutherland model. Especially, the evolution
of the magnetisation plateaus in SrCu2(BO3)2 with
pressure remains to be studied. Based on our results
presented here we can predict that in particular the
pressure range between 15 and 25 kbar will be of high
interest.

In conclusion we have performed high pressure ex-
periments on SrCu2(BO3)2 and tuned the compound to
experimentally identify a plaquette singlet phase at in-
termediate exchange ratio in the Shastry-Suterland lat-
tice. We observed a ﬁrst order transition taking place
between two magnetically disordered states: the exact 2-
spin dimer singlet and the 4-spin plaquette singlet phase.
The dominant correlations in the plaquette phase in-
volve a four-spin unit and are characterised by a low-
lying triplet excitation that is not present in the dimer
phase and that gives access to new types of ﬁeld- and
pressure-induced quantum critical points. The plaque-
tte phase itself is suppressed at higher pressures were
classical N´eel order is found. Particularly exciting is the
fact that the existence of two possible plaquette singlet
coverings oﬀer an Ising-type order parameter. This may
turn the transition from plaquette to N´eel phase into a
deconﬁned quantum critical point at 40 kbar.

imental intensities to this simple calculation favors the
singlets sitting on ’full’ plaquettes containing diagonal
bonds, but calculations of the structure factor for the
extended model are required for veriﬁcation of this point.

IN14, ILL, kf =1.5 ˚A−1, McWhan pressure cell, p≤22 kbar,
He-direct ﬂow cryostat, T=2 K. Setup 3: Same as setup 2,
with 3He cryostat, T=0.5 K. High pressure INS data was
also collected with the following setups: Setup 4: TASP,
SINQ-PSI, kf =1.3 ˚A−1, aluminum pressure cell, p≤12 kbar.
Setup 5: PANDA, FRM-2, kf =1.5 ˚A−1, HPCAL17. Setup 4-
5 have He-pumped cryostats, T=1.5 K. Given the unusual
temperature dependence in SrCu2(BO3)2, where the INS
intensity of the 35 K gap is reduced by half already around
7 K32, we performed the measurements at 21.5 kbar both
at 2 K and 0.5 K but no signiﬁcant change in the excitation
intensity was observed. AFM order was observed by neutron
diﬀraction on IN8, ILL, kf =2.66˚A−1, p≤65 kbar with a
Paris-Edinburgh press. Pressure was determined by the shift
in lattice constant of Pb or NaCl reference to ∼0.7 kbar
accuracy. The pressure dependence of magnetic susceptibility
was measured on a MPMS SQUID magnetometer (Quantum
Design) using non-magnetic CuBe clamp pressure cells
(CamCell). Pressure was calibrated by the superconducting
transition of Pb.
Data analysis. The pressure dependent gap ∆(Jχ(p), J(cid:48)
χ(p))
obtained through the Q=0 expansion of Ref. 10 with ex-
change parameters from ﬁts to susceptibility data is in good
agreement with the direct INS gap measurement ∆Q(p). To
take into account the small Q-dependence of ∆Q, due to
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions30, we additionally used

∆Q(p) = ∆(Jχ(p), J(cid:48)
factor DQ is of the order of 0.2 meV.

where the last term represents a diagonal bond between
sites 1 and 3 (a ’full’ plaquette), and should be removed
for a ’void’ plaquette without such a diagonal bond. The
eigenstates of H can be separated over two sectors depending
on the value of the quantum number S1,3 for the spins
(cid:126)S1 + (cid:126)S3 on the diagonal bond and S2,4 for the spins (cid:126)S2 + (cid:126)S4
on the outer sites27,28. A study of the excitation spectrum
of such a plaquette shows that for α ≥ 0.5 the ground state
is an S=0 singlet of four spins. Two low-lying excitations
T1 and T2 are present. For α ≥ 1, T1 has the lower energy,
while for 0.5 ≥ α ≥ 1 T2 does. T1 corresponds to a triplet
excitation with both S1,3 and S2,4 equal to 1.
In the full
plaquette, T2 is four-fold degenerate and corresponds to a
singlet on the diagonal S1,3=0 plus two free spins, S2,4= 0 or
1. The corresponding structure factor is identical to that of
the singlet-triplet excitation on the isolated diagonal bond.
For the void plaquette, T2 is sevenfold degenerate and the
structure factor does not match the isolated dimer.
