Using a graphical presentation of the spin S one dimensional Valence Bond Solid (VBS) state,
based on the representation theory of the SU (2) Lie-algebra of spins, we compute the spectrum
of a mixed state reduced density matrix. This mixed state of two blocks of spins A and B is
obtained by tracing out the spins outside A and B, in the pure VBS state density matrix. We
ﬁnd in particular that the negativity of the mixed state is non-zero only for adjacent subsystems.
The method introduced here can be generalized to the computation of entanglement properties in
Levin-Wen models, that possess a similar algebraic structure to the VBS state in the groundstate.

INTRODUCTION

The use of quantum information concepts in the study
and characterization of many-body systems has proved
highly fruitful [1]. A clear example of such concepts is the
entanglement entropy, which became an standard tool to
characterize gapped, topological and critical phases [2–
5]. Despite its usefulness, the entanglement entropy does
not fully capture the entanglement in multipartite sys-
tems. In systems with more than two components, the
state of any two subsystems is described in general by
a mixed state. In these systems, a measure of entangle-
ment that generalizes the Perez-Horodecki criterion [6]
has been proposed. This measure, called negativity [7]
is based on the partial positive transpose (PPT). For
a separable state, the partial transpose density matrix
(PTDM) is still a density matrix i.e. all its non-vanishing
eigenvalues are positive and add to one. In contrast, if
a state is not separable, then its PTDM has negative
eigenvalues [6]. The sum of the negative eigenvalues of
the PTDM is the negativity Neg(ρ). This quantity is a
good measure of entanglement in the sense that it satis-
ﬁes the following four fundamental criteria [7];

• i) Neg(ρ) ≥ 0, being zero just for unentangled

†
AB) = Neg(ρ) for any unitary

states.
• ii) Neg(UABρABU
UAB = UA ⊗ UB.
• iii) Neg(ρ) does not increase under Local Oper-
ations and Classical Communication (LOCC) or
post-selection.

• iv) Neg(ρ) is convex, i.e.

(cid:80)
i piNeg(ρi) ≥ Neg((cid:80)

for pi ≤ 0 and (cid:80)

i pi,
i piρi), meaning that it de-

creases under discarding information.

In systems with a small Hilbert space, the computa-
tion of the negativity can be done directly. In many-body
systems the sole computation of this entanglement mea-
sure becomes challenging. Noteworthy progress has been
achieved in systems with bosons [8], free fermions [9, 10],
conformally invariant systems in and out of equilibrium
[11–13], topological [14, 15] and spin systems [16–18].

In this article we present exact results for the nega-
tivity of a series of one dimensional interacting spin S
systems, whose groundstate generalize the valence bond
solid (VBS) state. The prime example of this type of sys-
tems is given by the Aﬄeck, Lieb, Kennedy and Tasaki
(AKLT) model. This model represents an example of a
gapped spin one system, representative of the Haldane
phase [19–21]. In the condensed matter community this
model is interesting because it realizes a Symmetry Pro-
tected Topological (STP) phase [22, 23]. For open bound-
ary conditions, the system exhibits fractionalized edge
modes localized on the edge of the system, and a ground
state degeneracy. In the quantum information commu-
nity, this model has also received attention as a possible
resource for measurement based quantum computation
[24–26].

The generalized model consists on integer spin S par-
ticles arranged on a line. The (frustration free) Hamil-
tonian is a sum of projectors into total spin Stot
i,i+1 =
Si + Si+1 > S of consecutive particles. For S = 1 it re-
duces to the usual AKLT model [27]. By tracing subsec-
tions of the chain, the reduced density matrix ρAB of the
mixed system of two intervals is obtained. The method
presented here to obtain the negativity relies heavily on
the representation theory of the SU (2) algebra. We ﬁrst
write the ground state in a matrix product state (MPS)
form, in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients. This al-
lows to represent the groundstate partial density matrix
as a state sum in a quasi one dimensional lattice, where
each link of the lattice has associated a SU (2) repre-
sentation label. Using F -moves (matrices of change of
basis between diﬀerent but equivalent fusion orderings)
and the symmetries of the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients,
we can diagonalize ρAB and its partial transpose ρTA
AB.

This paper is organized as follows. In section II we in-
troduce the generalized spin S VBS model, it’s MPS rep-
resentation and its graphical presentation based on the
representation theory of the SU (2) Lie algebra. In sec-
tion III we deﬁne the reduced density matrix to study by
tracing blocks of spins. We then compute the eigenvalues
of such operator by transforming the density matrix into
a standard basis in the tensor representation. In section
IV we analyze the eigenvalues of the partial transposed
density matrix and compute the negativity. Lastly, in

section V we present our conclusions.

II. SPIN S VBS STATE

Let’s consider the generalization of the AKLT model

for general integer spin S particles, with Hamiltonian

L(cid:88)

H =

L(cid:88)

2S(cid:88)

hi,i+1 =

Πs(i, i + 1),

(1)

i=1

i=1

s=S+1

where Πs(i, i+1) is a projector onto the subspace spanned
by the s-multiplet formed by spins at i and i + 1. This
Hamiltonian is positive deﬁnite. As in the AKLT case,
the groundstate can be found exactly by considering each
spin S particle as the result of a projection onto the sym-
metric subspace of two spin S/2 particles. Then, each
virtual particle of spin S/2 is antisymmetrized with its
nearest neighbor into the singlet state. The presence of
this singlet between consecutive particles prevents the
formation of total spin Si,i+1 = Si + Si+1 larger than
S. Repeating this procedure with every particle in the
chain, we obtain a state that is annihilated by the Hamil-
tonian (1). It corresponds to the groundstate of (1) with
eigenvalue zero.

Let us now write down the MPS representation of the
spin S VBS state. General boundary conditions can be
implemented by boundary tensors u1, uL

is done over the auxiliary matrix space. The elements of

Diagrammatic presentation

It is convenient to introduce a diagrammatic presenta-
tion of the diﬀerent tensors appearing above, as otherwise
the notation becomes quickly very cumbersome. This
presentation also makes clear which manipulations are
being done with the diﬀerent expressions. The building
blocks for the diagrammatic presentation are presented
in Fig. 1. The concatenation of two objects by joining

FIG. 1. (color online) i) A north directed arrow represents
a ket state vector. An arrow directed south represents a bra
(dual state vector).
ii) A Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient corre-
sponds to a three legged diagram. It is convenient to color
the legs of the diagram to keep track of the extra factors be-
tween the 3j symbols and the Clesbsh-Gordan symbols. iii)
The diagram with a black dot corresponds to the components
of the singlet.

their lines corresponds to sum over all the possible indices
of the lines at the concatenation point. The concatena-
tion of a bra and a ket corresponds to taking their inner
product.
Using this presentation, the groundstate |G(cid:105) is simply

The state |G(cid:105) is annihilated by the generalized AKLT
Hamiltonian (1) with periodic boundary conditions.

Given the symmetry under translations, the ground-
state correlation functions are completely determined by

ﬁcients as is clear how to contract them. The state |G(cid:105)
can be thought as a very simple one dimensional lattice

gauge theory, where each horizontal line carries a SU (2)
singlet (trivial representation). Each vertical line carries
a spin S representation. Attached to this representation
is a state that acts on the physical Hilbert space. The
one dimensional transfer matrix G, deﬁned in (8), has
the following presentation

(13)

In this basis, the density matrix operator is given by

the diagram

where the values (j, m) of the internal line on the right
diagram are being summed over, with weight λj.

(11)

III. REDUCED DENSITY MATRIX

We are interested in the partial density matrix ob-
tained by tracing subsystems of the original pure ground
state. We partition the system into ﬁve distinct consec-
utive regions, of lengths L1, LA, L2, LB, and L3. Tracing
out the spin degrees of freedom in the ﬁrst, third and last
regions, we obtain a mixed state described by the par-
tial density matrix = ρAB = tr1,2,3(|G(cid:105)(cid:104)G|). This density
matrix, for any boundary condition, corresponds to the
diagram

(12)
Here N is a normalization constant such that trρAB = 1.
Internal lines with no explicit label carry an S/2 represen-
tation. Diﬀerent boundary conditions are implemented
by diﬀerent contractions of the outermost tensors. The
lower diagram is obtained by repeated use of eq. (8) on
the upper diagram. The colors in the upper diagram, cor-
responding to the original MPS presentation, are omit-
ted. In the bottom diagram, and in the rest of the text,
the diﬀerent colors of the legs in the Clebsch-Gordan co-
eﬃcients are explicitly shown.

The partial density matrix ρAB is an operator that
acts in the Hilbert space of the A and B subsystems.
It is convenient to introduce a orthogonal basis on the
A, B subsystems. We choose the orthogonal basis (See

with η(Lα)
k=0(λk)Lα FJα,k, and α = A, B. Using

is a combination of F -symbols, given

gram (16) carries a SU (2) representation label, and the
vertex where three lines meet corresponds to a Clebsch-
Gordan symbol. An object with these characteristics (i.e
a lattice with representations associated to each link, and
associators when three or more representation meet) is
known in the mathematical literature as a state sum [29].
In physics, such an object corresponds to a very simple
Levin-Wen model [30] (without long-range order).

To make further progress, we need to choose some
boundary conditions. Assuming periodic boundary con-
ditions (PBC) amounts for contracting the outermost
tensors in the diagram above. In the standard basis, after
a series of F -moves and recolorings, the reduced density

In Ref.
[17] we proved this conjecture for spin S = 1.
Although a proof for a given value of S can be obtained
by a direct computation of the negativity for diﬀerent
lengths, for arbitrary value of S this is impracticable.
We can further restrict the direct computation to just
L1 + L3 = L2 = 1 (for spin S/2 boundary conditions).
As the VBS state can be constructed inductively by series
of local operations (projection of two spin S/2 particles
in each physical site onto the symmetric subspace, plus
an antisymmetrization of spin S/2 particles on consecu-
tive physical sites), a vanishing negativity Neg(ρAB) for
a particular length (cid:96) implies that Neg(ρAB) = 0 for all
L ≥ (cid:96), due to the monotonicity of the negativity under
LOCC. We have indeed veriﬁed that this is the case for
S = 2, 3.

V. CONCLUSION

The AKLT model represents a simple interacting
many-body system of interest for both the condensed
matter and quantum information community. It realizes
the Haldane phase, a gapped phase with symmetry pro-
tected topological order. Its VBS groundstate, also serves
as a resource for measurement based quantum informa-
tion. Although being an interacting theory, the VBS
groundstate can be written exactly by using simple MPS.
The matrices in these MPS are naturally Clebsch-Gordan
coeﬃcients between representations of spin S and spin
S/2 for a chain of spin S particles. Using the representa-
tion theory of the SU (2) algebra, we study the bipartite
entanglement of the mixed state density matrix obtained
by tracing out diﬀerent sections of the pure state density
matrix. In particular, we managed to calculate negativ-
ity between two blocks of spins analytically, in the case
when the blocks are adjacent. Our results are exact for
any value of the spin S as for any length of the blocks, in
a chain with periodic boundary conditions. For non ad-
jacent blocks, we checked that the negativity vanishes for
S = 1, 2, 3, and conjectured that the negativity vanishes
for any value of the spin S. We think that vanishing neg-
ativity for two non-touching blocks is unique characteri-
zation of VBS states. For generic short-range entangled
states, we expect the negativity to decay exponentially
with the separation between the blocks, with a character-
istic decay length proportional to the correlation length.
The methods used here allow the computation of mul-
tipartite entanglement density matrix, where the SU (2)
symmetry is manifest at each stage. We expect that the
methods presented here, which rely on the associativity of
the tensor product of representations, can be extended to
the study of ground state properties in string-net modes,
where the categorical data in such models satisﬁes similar

Other generic cases are plotted in Fig. 2.

General Block separation and LOCC

The negativity found in (29) is valid just for adjacent
blocks (L1 = L2 = L3 = 0). From the exact density
matrix (17) for PBC and (21) for spin S/2 particles in the
boundary, we can compute the negativity for any ﬁxed
value of S, LA, LB, L1, L2 and L3 by exact (numerical)
diagonalization. In the case of S = 1, 2, 3 and PBC we
that whenever L1 +L3 = L2 = 1, the negativity vanishes.
For general spin S and separations L1 + L3, L2 ≥ 1, we
conjecture the following

• Conjecture: The negativity of a bipartite system
of two blocks A and B in the one dimensional spin
S VBS state vanishes for blocks with no common
boundary.
