EXISTENCE AND STABILITY OF PLANAR SHOCKS OF VISCOUS

SCALAR CONSERVATION LAWS WITH SPACE-PERIODIC FLUX

ANNE-LAURE DALIBARD AND MOON-JIN KANG

Abstract. The goal of this paper is to prove the existence and stability of shocks for
viscous scalar conservation laws with space periodic ﬂux, in the multi-dimensional case.
Such a result had been proved by the ﬁrst author in one space dimension, but the exten-
sion to a multi-dimensional setting makes the existence proof non-trivial. We construct
approximate solutions by restricting the size of the domain and then passing to the limit
as the size of the domain goes to inﬁnity. One of the key steps is a “normalization” pro-
cedure, which ensures that the limit objects obtained by the approximation scheme are
indeed shocks. The proofs rely on elliptic PDE theory rather than ODE arguments as in
the 1d case. Once the existence of shocks is proved, their stability follows from classical
arguments based on the theory of dynamical systems.

1. Introduction and Main results

In this article, we aim to show the existence and large time stability of multidimensional

planar shock fronts of viscous scalar conservation laws with space-periodic ﬂux:

(1.1)

∂tu +

N

Xi=1

∂xiAi(x, u) = ∆xu,

t > 0, x ∈ RN ,

u(0, x) = u0(x)

where the ﬂux functions Ai : TN × R → RN are assumed to be periodic with respect to the
spatial variable x.

The issues in the case of one dimension N = 1 have been treated by the ﬁrst author in

[5], and therefore our goal is to tackle these issues in the multidimensional case (N ≥ 2).
When the ﬂux A is homogeneous, i.e. when A does not depend on x, a planar shock wave
is a special solution of (1.1) of the form u(t, x) = U (x · ν − ct), for some c ∈ R, ν ∈ SN −1,
U ∈ L∞(RN ), and with limy→±∞ U (y) = U±, for some constants U+, U− ∈ R. The proﬁle U
is easily found thanks to simple ODE theory together with Rankine-Hugoniot condition. But
the stability of planar shock fronts is a challenging issues. Stability for a small perturbation
of multidimensional planar shocks has been shown by Goodman [9], Hoﬀ and Zumbrun
[10], and the second author, Vasseur and Wang [12]. In one-dimensional case, Freist¨uhler
and Serre [8] proved L1-stability for any L1-perturbation. Recently, the second author and
Vasseur [11] have shown contraction for any L2-perturbation.
But when A depends on the space variable, the constants are no longer stationary solutions

of (1.1) in general, and thus cannot be end states of planar shocks. Therefore we ﬁrst
introduce a family of periodic stationary solutions of (1.1), which will play the role of
constant solutions in the homogeneous case. These solutions were introduced in [4].

Proposition 1.1 (Existence of periodic stationary solutions of (1.1), see [4]).
Let A ∈ W 1,∞
when N > 2 such that for all (x, v) ∈ TN × R,

loc (TN × R)N . Assume that there exists C0 > 0, and m ∈ [0, ∞), n ∈ [0, N +2
N −2 )

(1.2a)

(1.2b)

|∂vAi(x, v)| ≤ C0(1 + |v|m),
|divxA(x, v)| ≤ C0(1 + |v|n).

1 ≤ i ≤ N,

Assume as well that one of the following three conditions holds:

(1.3)

i) m = 0 or

ii) 0 ≤ n < 1

or

iii) (cid:16)n < min(

N + 2

N

, 2)

and ∃p0 s.t.

N

Xi=1

∂xiAi(x, p0) ≡ 0(cid:17).

Then for each p ∈ R, there exists a unique periodic solution v(·, p) ∈ H 1(TN ) of the equation

(1.4)

− ∆xv(x, p) + divxA(x, v(x, p)) = 0, < v(·, p) >= p.

In the above proposition and throughout the article, the brackets h·i denote the average

value of a TN -periodic function.

We list below further properties of the functions v(x, p) (see Proposition 2.1). We also

deﬁne the averaged - or homogenized - ﬂux ¯A by

We are now ready to deﬁne stationary (or standing) planar shocks.

¯A(p) := hA(·, v(·, p))i

∀p ∈ R.

Deﬁnition 1.1. A stationary planar viscous shock of (1.1) with periodic end states is a
function ¯U ∈ H 1
loc(RN ) which is a stationary solution of (1.1), periodic in the variables
x1, · · · xk−1, xk+1, · · · xN for some k ∈ {1, · · · , N }, and such that there exist p+, p− ∈ R
with p+ 6= p− such that

(1.5)

in L∞(TN −1),

lim

xk→±∞(cid:0) ¯U (x) − v(x, p±)(cid:1) = 0

Such a function is called a stationary shock of (1.1) with end states v(·, p±), or a stationary
shock of (1.1) connecting v(·, p−) to v(·, p+).

Remark 1.1. Notice that because of the periodicity of the ﬂux and of the stationary states,
we only consider shocks in the directions e1, · · · , eN , (i.e. in the directions of the canonical
basis in RN ), and not in any direction ν ∈ SN −1 as in the homogeneous case. Indeed, if we
take an arbitrary direction ν and look for a shock such that U (x · ν, x⊥) − U±(x) → 0 as
x · ν → ±∞, where x⊥ · ν = 0, then in general the asymptotic states U± are not periodic
solutions of (1.1), but quasi-periodic solutions. Therefore a ﬁrst step would be to study
problems of the type

−∆v + div ˜A(x, v) = 0

where the ﬂux ˜A is quasi-periodic in its ﬁrst variable and the function v is sought as periodic.
This is expected to be much more diﬃcult than in the periodic case, due to the lack of
compactness and to the non-linearity. Such questions go beyond the scope of this paper, and

3

thus we focus on periodic end states only.
Moreover, without loss of generality, we focus on the case when k = 1 in the rest of the
paper.

The stationary shocks in Deﬁnition 1.1 can be viewed as a spatial transition front in
a space-periodic environment. The spatial transition fronts arising in various (periodic)
heterogeneities have also received a lot of attention in the reaction-diﬀusion community. In
particular, the existence of spatial transition waves for one-dimensional space-heterogenous
reaction-diﬀusion equation has been proved by Xin [23] and Berestycki and Hamel [1], and
by Nolen and Ryzhik [20] and Mellet, Raquejoﬀre and Sire [16] for ignition-type equation.
These results have been extended by Zlatos [24] to multidimensional case of the cylindrical
domain R × TN −1. We also refer to [2, 3] for a generalization of the notion of the transition
fronts, whereas non-existence of such waves has been studied by Nadin [18] and Nolen et
al.
[19]. Such transition wave for space-heterogenous reaction-diﬀusion equation connects
two steady states, which are constants, contrary to our case that the stationary shock wave
connects two steady states, which are non-constant periodic solutions.

Our main result is the following:

Theorem 1.1. (Existence of standing shocks) Assume that A ∈ W 1,∞
loc (TN × R)N , and
that there exist two periodic solutions v(·, p+), v(·, p−) to (1.4) with p+ 6= p−, satisfying the
following conditions:

(1.6a)

¯A1(p−) = ¯A1(p+) =: α,
¯A1(p) < α, ∀p ∈ (p+, p−) if p+ < p−,

(1.6b)
Then there exists a stationary shock ¯V with end states v(·, p−) and v(·, p+).
Remark 1.2. The ﬁrst assumption (1.6a) is an analogue of the Rankine-Hugoniot condition
for standing shock waves of homogeneous conservation laws. The second assumption (1.6b)
is the analogue of the Oleinik condition. It is proved in section 3 that the Rankine-Hugoniot
condition is in fact a necessary condition for the existence of a shock wave.

¯A1(p) > α, ∀p ∈ (p−, p+) if p− < p+.

Theorem 1.1 is proved by passing to the limit in a sequence of approximate problems.
In these approximate problems, the domain R × TN −1 is replaced by (−R, R) × TN −1
for some R > 0. Standard tools of elliptic theory (Harnack inequality, maximum principle,
comparison principle, regularity estimates) are used to prove that the approximate sequence
enjoys several nice properties, such as monotony and L∞ bounds.

From now on, we only handle the ﬁrst case of (1.6b), i.e.,

(1.7)

p+ < p−,

¯A1(p) < α,

∀p ∈ (p+, p−),

the argument for the other case is exactly identical.

Theorem 1.2. (Stability of standing shocks) Assume the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1, fur-
thermore A ∈ W 3,∞
loc (TN × R)N . Let ¯U be a stationary shock wave connecting v(·, p−) to
v(·, p+), and u0 ∈ ¯U + L1(R × TN −1) be a initial perturbation such that
for a.e. x ∈ R × TN −1,
(1.8)

v(x, p+) ≤ u0(x) ≤ v(x, p−)

and u = u(t, x) be the unique entropy solution of (1.1) with u|t=0 = u0.

• Assume that RR×TN −1(u0 − ¯U ) = 0. Then

lim
t→∞

ku(t) − ¯U kL1(R×TN −1) = 0.

4

DALIBARD AND KANG

• Assume that A ∈ W 3,∞

functions φ, ψ ∈ L1(T) such that

loc (TN × R)N , that RR×TN −1(u0 − ¯U ) 6= 0 and that there exist

(1.9)

(1.10)

and

∂vA1(x, v(x, p−)) ≥ φ(x1),

for a.e. x ∈ TN ,

a− := ZT

φdx1 > 0,

∂vA1(x, v(x, p+)) ≤ ψ(x1),

for a.e. x ∈ TN ,

a+ := ZT

ψdx1 < 0.

Then there exists a stationary shock ¯V connecting v(·, p−) to v(·, p+) such that

u0 − ¯V ∈ L1(R × TN −1) and

ZR×TN −1

(u0 − ¯V ) = 0 and

lim
t→∞

ku(t) − ¯V kL1(R×TN −1) = 0.

Remark 1.3. • The assumptions (1.9) and (1.10) are the analogue of the Lax condi-
tions for standing shock waves of homogeneous conservation laws. They are used in the
present context to obtain a rate of convergence of stationary shocks towards their end states
v(·, p±). This rate of convergence yields some L1 compactness for an approximate problem
(see (3.28)). We refer to the proofs of Lemma 3.2 and Proposition 3.2 below for details.

• The proof of Theorem 1.2 uses classical arguments, relying on tools from dynamical
system theory. The main diﬃculty lies in the second part of Theorem 1.2, which requires,
for any real number q and any shock ¯U , to ﬁnd a shock ¯V with the same end states as ¯U and

such that R ( ¯V − ¯U ) = q. This fact is almost obvious in the homogeneous case, since any

spatial translate of a shock is a shock. This statement is still rather easy to prove in the 1d
case, since a whole family of shocks depending continuously on a parameter is constructed.
In the present case, Theorem 1.1 only gives the existence of a single shock, and therefore
the existence of shocks satisfying the above statement for any q ∈ R is far from trivial, and
is proved in Proposition 3.2.

• Assumption (1.8) is a classical assumption within the framework of shock stability for
conservation laws (see [22] and the discussion on initial data within the interval [u+, u−] or
outside that interval). In order to remove it, we would typically need to prove the stability
of the periodic solutions v(·, p±) under zero-mass perturbation in the space L1(R × TN −1).
However, to our knowledge, the stability of the functions v(·, p±) is known in L1(RN ) and
in L1(TN ) (see respectively [6] and [5]), but not in L1(R × TN −1). Furthermore, the proofs
of stability in the whole space RN and in the torus TN rely on very diﬀerent arguments,
since in the whole space, dispersive eﬀects take place. It is possible that a hybrid proof could
be worked out in spaces of the form Rk × Tl with k + l = N , but such a question goes beyond
the scope of this paper and thus we choose to leave it open.

We now provide some examples of ﬂuxes satisfying assumptions (1.6a)-(1.6b), and (1.9)-
(1.10). Let Φ : TN → RN be a divergence-free vector ﬁeld, f ∈ C1(R, R), and let A(x, v) :=
Φ(x)f (v). Then for any constant p ∈ R, v(·, p) := p is a solution to the elliptic equation
(1.4) with < v(·, p) >= p. As a consequence,

¯A1(p) = ZTN

A1(x, p)dx = f (p) hΦ1i .

5

Thus (1.6a) holds if and only if f (p+) = f (p−), and (1.6b) holds if and only if f (p) − f (p±)
has the same (strict) sign as hΦ1i (p+ − p−) for p ∈ (p+, p−). For instance, if hΦ1i > 0 and
f (p) = p2, any couple p− = −p+ > 0 works.
Moreover,

∂vA1(x, v(x, p)) = Φ1(x)f ′(p),

and therefore (1.9)-(1.10) are satisﬁed for instance if there exists α > 0 such that Φ1(x) ≥ α
for all x, and if f is strongly convex and such that f (p+) = f (p−), with p+ < p−.

Let us now introduce some notation that will be used throughout the paper. We will

often denote the spatial domain by

Ω := R × TN −1.

In a similar way, we deﬁne, for R > 0,

ΩR := (−R, R) × TN −1.

We introduce the space L1

0(R × TN −1) of integrable functions with zero mass

L1

0(R × TN −1) := (cid:26)f ∈ L1(R × TN −1), ZR×TN −1

f = 0(cid:27) .

For any integer k ∈ Z, and any function f ∈ L1

loc(Ω), we deﬁne

τkf (x) := f (x + ke1),

∀x ∈ R × TN −1.

Let us stress that the main diﬃculty in this article lies in proving the existence of shock
waves. Indeed, shock stability follows from classical arguments in [5] relying on dynamical
system theory (see [21]). We recall the arguments in section 4 for the reader’s convenience,
but the largest part of the paper is devoted to the existence of shocks.

The paper is organized as follows: section 2 is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.1. In
section 3, we review some properties of stationary shocks. Eventually, section 4 is devoted
to the proof of Theorem 1.2.

2. Proof of Theorem 1.1

In this section, we construct stationary shocks thanks to an approximation scheme on
compact sets, and then pass to the limit. The proof makes an extensive use of the maximum
principle and of the Rankine-Hugoniot (1.6a) and Oleinik conditions (1.6b).

Before addressing the proof, we ﬁrst recall some properties of the functions v(·, p) (see

[4]):

Proposition 2.1. Assume that the hypotheses of Proposition 1.1 are satisﬁed. The family
(v(·, p))p∈R satisﬁes the following properties:
(i) Regularity estimate : For all p ∈ R, v(·, p) ∈ W 2,q(TN ) for all 1 < q < ∞ and

∀R > 0, ∃CR > 0

s.t.

sup

p∈[−R,R]

kv(p)kW 2,q(TN ) ≤ CR.

(ii) Growth property : if p > p′, then

x ∈ TN
(iii) p-derivative : For all p ∈ R, ∂pv(·, p) ∈ H 1(TN ) and

v(x, p) < v(x, p′),

∀R > 0, ∃CR > 0

s.t.

Moreover,

2.1. Construction of approximate solutions. For any R > 1, consider the approximate
equation:

(2.13)

−∆ ¯UR + divA(x, ¯UR) = 0 in (−R, R) × TN −1,

¯UR(±R, x′) = v(±R, x′, p±) ∀x′ ∈ TN −1.

For the time being, we assume that the ﬂux A satisﬁes the assumptions of Proposition
1.1 with m = 0 and n < 1, i.e. A is uniformly Lipschitz with respect to its second variable,
and divxA has sublinear growth. These assumptions will be removed in Remark 2.1.

In this paragraph, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of (2.13) for any
R > 1. Using the family v : TN × R → R constructed in Proposition 1.1, we consider a
composite function V (x) := v(x, f (x1)) for some f ∈ C∞(R) with f (x1) = p− if x1 ≤ −1,
f (x1) = p+ if x1 ≥ 1. Then we see that (2.13) is equivalent to
−∆UR + divB(x, UR) = S in ΩR,

(2.14)

UR(±R, x′) = 0,

where UR := ¯UR − V and S := ∆V − divA(x, V ), B(x, r) := A(x, V + r) − A(x, V ). Notice
that since A is uniformly Lipschitz with respect to r, there exists a constant C such that

|B(x, r)| ≤ C|r| ∀x ∈ Ω, ∀r ∈ R.

Moreover, according to the deﬁnition of S and to Proposition 1.1, the support of the function
S is included in [−1, 1] × TN −1, and S ∈ L2(Ω).

Therefore, it is enough to prove the existence of (2.14). We want to apply Schaeﬀer’s
0 (ΩR) such

ﬁxed point theorem. Let us consider the continuous mapping LR : H 1
that W = LR(U ) is the unique solution of the linear elliptic equation:

0 (ΩR) → H 1

−∆W + divB(x, U ) = S in ΩR,

W (±R, x′) = 0.

We use assumption (1.2a) with m = 0 and we obtain

k∇W k2

L2(ΩR) ≤ kSkL2(ΩR)kW kL2(ΩR) + C0kU kL2(ΩR)k∇W kL2(ΩR).

Using the Poincar´e inequality and Young’s inequality, we have that

k∇W kL2(ΩR) ≤ CRkSkL2(ΩR) + CkU kL2(ΩR),

for some constant CR depending on R.
Since f is smooth, it follows from Proposition 1.1 that

k∇W kL2(ΩR) ≤ CR(kU kL2(ΩR) + 1).

Thus, using the Rellich-Kondrachov theorem, we infer that the mapping LR is compact.
Now, there remains to prove that the set

is bounded. For any λ ∈ [0, 1] and for any solution U λ of U λ = λLR(U λ), we have

{U λ ∈ H 1

0 (ΩR) | U λ = λLR(U λ), λ ∈ [0, 1]}

Let b : (x, r) ∈ RN +1 7→ R r

(divxb)(x, U λ).

Notice that

divxb(x, r) = Z r

0 (cid:16)divA(x, V + r′) − divA(x, V )(cid:17) dr′,

and therefore, using the growth assumption on A, there exists a constant C such that for
all r ∈ R,

Using once again the Cauchy-Schwartz and the Poincar´e inequality, we infer that

|divxb(x, r)| ≤ C(1 + |r|n+1) with n < 1.

kU λkH 1(ΩR) ≤ CR ∀λ ∈ [0, 1].

According to Schaeﬀer’s ﬁxed point theorem, LR has a ﬁxed point in H 1

0 (ΩR), and there-

fore (2.13) has a solution in H 1(ΩR).

Uniqueness follows for instance from the following argument. Let ¯UR, ¯U ′

R be two solutions

of (2.13), and let W := ¯UR − ¯U ′

R. Then W solves an elliptic equation of the type

−∆W + div(aRW ) = 0 in ΩR,

W (±R, x′) = 0,

where aR ∈ L∞(ΩR) is deﬁned by

aR(x) := Z 1

0

∂vA(x, τ ¯UR(x) + (1 − τ ) ¯U ′

R(x))dτ.

On the other hand, using the strong form of the Krein-Rutman Theorem (see Appendix),

it can be proved that the equation

−∆w + div(aRw) = 0 in ΩR,
−∂1w + aR,1w = 0 on ∂ΩR

admits a unique positive solution w ∈ C( ¯ΩR) ∩ H 1(ΩR) such that RΩR

ward computation (see [17]) shows that

w = 1. A straightfor-

2.2. Properties of approximate solutions. We claim that the approximate solution ¯UR
satisﬁes the following properties.
Lemma 2.1. For any ﬁxed integer R > 1, let ¯UR be the solution of (2.13). Then the
following properties holds.

(1) A priori bound in L∞: for all x ∈ ΩR,

v(x, p+) ≤ ¯UR(x) ≤ v(x, p−).

(2) Integration constant: there exists a number αR such that for all x1 ∈ (−R, R),

(2.15)

−

d

dx1 ZTN −1

¯UR(x1, x′) dx′ +ZTN −1

A1(x1, x′, ¯UR(x1, x′)) dx′ = αR,

and α ≤ αR ≤ C for some constant C independent of R. (Recall α := ¯A1(p−) =
¯A1(p+))

(3) Monotony: for all x ∈ (−R, R − 1) × TN −1,

¯UR(x1 + 1, x′) < ¯UR(x1, x′).

(4) Uniform local a priori bound: for any q ∈ (1, ∞), there exists a constant Cq (inde-

pendent of R) such that

sup

k∈{−R,···R−1}

k ¯URkW 2,q((k,k+1)×TN −1) ≤ Cq.

Proof. For the time being, we still assume that the ﬂux A satisﬁes the assumptions of
Proposition 1.1 with m = 0 and n < 1, which will be removed in Remark 2.1.

(1) A priori bound in L∞:

First, notice that using elliptic regularity results together with a bootstrap ar-
gument, it is easily proved that ¯UR ∈ W 2,q(ΩR) for all q < ∞, and therefore
¯UR ∈ C(ΩR). Thus, thanks to (2.12) in Proposition 2.1 and to the assumption
m = 0, there exist ¯pR, p

R

v(x, p

R

with ¯pR > p
) ≤ ¯UR(x) ≤ v(x, ¯pR) ∀x ∈ ¯ΩR.

such that

R

R

Let us choose ¯pR (resp. p

) as the smallest (resp. the largest) real number such
that the above inequality is satisﬁed. Then necessarily, since ¯UR and v(x, ¯pR) are
continuous and ¯ΩR is compact, there exists xR ∈ ΩR such that ¯UR(xR) = v(xR, ¯pR).
Let us argue by contradiction, and assume that xR is an interior point of ΩR.
Notice that gR := v(x, ¯pR) − ¯UR is a non-negative solution of an elliptic equation of
the type

where a ∈ L∞(ΩR) is deﬁned by

−∆gR + div(agR) = 0 in ΩR,

a(x) := Z 1

0

∂vA(x, τ v(x, ¯pR) + (1 − τ ) ¯UR(x))dτ.

Since xR is an interior point and gR(xR) = 0, by the Harnack inequality, we have
that gR vanishes on any compactly embedded subset of ΩR. Thus by continuity,
gR ≡ 0 on ΩR, which is in the contradiction with ¯UR ∈ C(ΩR) and p+ 6= p−.
Therefore, xR ∈ ∂ΩR, thus ¯pR ∈ {p+, p−}. Since p+ < p−, we have ¯pR = p−.
Similar arguments lead to p

= p+.

(3) Monotony:

Consider the function ¯UR(x1 + 1, x′) deﬁned on (−R − 1, R − 1) × TN −1. Since
the ﬂux A is periodic, ¯UR(x1 + 1, x′) satisﬁes the same equation as ¯UR. Moreover,
using the L∞ a priori estimates and the boundary conditions on ¯UR, we have that

¯UR(x1 + 1, x′) − ¯UR(x1, x′) ≤ 0 at x1 = −R and at x1 = R − 1.

Set HR := ¯UR(x1 + 1, x′) − ¯UR(x1, x′) and (HR)− := −HR1HR≤0. Since the function
x 7→ −x1x≤0 is convex, we have that in D′((−R, R − 1) × TN −1),

(2.16)

− ∆(HR)− + divx(cid:0)−1HR≤0(A(x, ¯UR(x1 + 1, x′)) − A(x, ¯UR(x1, x′)))(cid:1) ≤ 0.

We denote by −mR the left hand-side of the above inequality. Then mR is a non-
negative measure. Moreover, straightforward integrations entail

Since HR ≤ 0 at x1 = −R and at x1 = R − 1, we have

∂1(HR)− = −1HR≤0∂1HR = −∂1HR at x1 = −R and R − 1.

Using (2.15), we have that

(A1(R, x′, ¯UR(R, x′))dx′

= αR − αR = 0.

Similarly we have the same result at x1 = −R. Therefore, it follows from (2.17)
that mR((−R, R − 1) × TN −1) = 0, and thus

−∆(HR)− + divx(cid:0)−1HR≤0(A(x, ¯UR(x1 + 1, x′)) − A(x, ¯UR(x1, x′)))(cid:1) = 0.

That is, (HR)− is a non-negative solution of an elliptic equation of the type:

−∆(HR)− + divx (aR(HR)−) = 0,

where aR ∈ L∞((−R, R − 1) × TN −1) is deﬁned by

aR := Z 1

0

∂vA(x, τ ¯UR(x + e1) + (1 − τ ) ¯UR(x))dτ.

Let us argue by contradiction and assume that HR(x0) ≥ 0 for some x0 ∈ (−R, R −
1) × TN −1. Then (HR)−(x0) = 0,and Harnack’s inequality implies that (HR)− = 0
on (−R, R − 1) × TN −1.
In that case, HR(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ (−R, R − 1) × TN −1, and since R is an integer,
we obtain

v(x, p+) = ¯UR(R, x′) ≥ ¯UR(R − 1, x′) ≥ · · · ≥ ¯UR(−R, x′) = v(x, p−).

This is in contradiction with p+ < p− as (1.7). Therefore, we deduce that HR(x) < 0
for all x ∈ (−R, R − 1) × TN −1, and

¯UR(x1 + 1, x′) − ¯UR(x1, x′) < 0 ∀x ∈ (−R, R − 1) × TN −1.

11

(4) Uniform bounds in Sobolev spaces:

For any k ∈ {−R + 1, · · · , R − 2}, ¯UR solves the equation
−∆ ¯UR = −divA(x, ¯UR) in (k, k + 1) × TN −1,

with the inherited boundary conditions, which are bounded in L∞(TN −1) uniformly
in R and k thanks to (1). Using the L∞ a priori bound together with interior elliptic
estimates, we infer that ¯UR is bounded in H 1((k, k + 1) × TN −1) (and even in W 1,q
for any q < ∞), uniformly in k and R. Using a classical bootstrap argument, we
then prove that ¯UR is bounded in W 2,q((k, k + 1) × TN −1) for any q < ∞. Using
the fact that the boundary conditions at −R and R are smooth and bounded, we
derive similar bounds on (−R, −R + 1) × TN −1 and (R − 1, R) × TN −1. Hence the
result follows.

(cid:3)

Remark 2.1. We here explain how we can remove the constraints m = 0 and n < 1 on
growth assumptions of the ﬂux. Assume that A belongs to W 1,∞
loc (TN × R) and that there
exist two periodic solutions v(·, p±) of (1.4) with p+ 6= p− satisfying (1.6a).
Let

and χ ∈ C∞

0 (R) such that χ(ξ) = 1 for |ξ| ≤ C0 + 1. Deﬁne

C0 := max(kv(·, p+)k∞, kv(·, p−)k∞).

Aχ(x, ξ) := A(x, ξ)χ(ξ),

x ∈ TN , ξ ∈ R

Then the ﬂux Aχ belongs to W 1,∞(TN × R) and satisﬁes the growth assumptions of Propo-
sition 1.1 with m = n = 0. Therefore, for any p ∈ R there exists a unique periodic solution
vχ(·, p) of

−∆vχ(x) + divAχ(x, vχ(x, p)) = 0 in TN ,

hvχ(·, p)i = p.

It follows from the uniqueness of vχ and from the deﬁnition of Aχ that vχ(·, p±) = v(·, p±).
Now, we can apply the results proved above to the ﬂux Aχ. Thus there exists a unique
R enjoys the properties of

R of equation (2.13) with A replaced by Aχ, and ¯U χ

solution ¯U χ
Lemma 2.1. In particular, k ¯U χ

Rk∞ ≤ C0, and thus
R) = A(x, ¯U χ
Aχ(x, ¯U χ

R) ∀x ∈ ΩR.

Hence ¯U χ
χ’s, and consider arbitrary ﬂuxes A ∈ W 1,∞
1.1.

R is also a solution of (2.13) with the original ﬂux A. Thus we can now drop the
loc (TN ×R) satisfying the assumptions of Theorem

2.3. Passing to the limit as R → ∞.

⊲ First step: Extension to R × TN −1 and “normalization”.
We ﬁrst extend ¯UR to R × TN −1 by setting

¯UR(x) = v(x, p+) for x1 ≥ R,

(2.18)
Thanks to (4) of Lemma 2.1 and to the regularity of v, the above function ¯UR is continuous
and bounded uniformly in R in W 1,∞(R × TN −1). Moreover ¯UR(· + e1) ≤ ¯UR over the whole
space.

¯UR(x) = v(x, p−) for x1 ≤ −R.

Before passing to the limit, one issue is that all integer translations in x1 of shocks are
also shocks. And a shock translated by ke1, with |k| ≫ 1, is very close to one of the end
states v(·, p±) on compact sets in all Sobolev norms. In order to prevent ¯UR from converging

12

DALIBARD AND KANG

towards v(·, p±), we ﬁx the value (or rather, the mean value) of (a translate of) ¯UR at a
given point. We call this step the “normalization” of ¯UR.

More precisely, let ¯p ∈ (p+, p−) be arbitrary (for instance, take ¯p = p++p−
Z 1
0 ZTN −1

¯UR(R + x1, x′) dx′ dx1 = p+ and

Z 1
0 ZTN −1

¯UR(−R − 1 + x1, x′) dx′ dx1 = p−,

). Then since

2

there exists xR ∈ (−R − 1, R) such that

Z 1
0 ZTN −1

¯UR(xR + x1, x′) dx′ dx1 = ¯p.

Let kR := ⌊xR⌋ ∈ Z and deﬁne ¯VR := ¯UR(x1 + kR, x′). Then since A and v are periodic in
their ﬁrst variable, ¯VR solves

(2.19)

− ∆ ¯VR + divA(x, ¯VR) = 0 in (−R − kR, R − kR) × TN −1,
¯VR(−R − kR, x′) = v(−R − kR, x′, p−),
¯VR(R − kR, x′) = v(R − kR, x′, p+),
and there exists yR ∈ [0, 1) (yR = xR − kR) such that

x′ ∈ TN −1,

Z 1
0 ZTN −1

¯VR(yR + x1, x′) dx′ dx1 = ¯p.

Additionally, ¯VR inherits from ¯UR all the properties listed in Lemma 2.1.

⊲ Second step: Limit R → ∞.
Thanks to the bounds listed above and in Lemma 2.1, we can extract a subsequence Rm
and ﬁnd a function ¯V such that ¯VRm ⇀ ¯V in W 1,q(K), ∀q ∈ [1, ∞) for any compact set
K ⊂ R × TN −1, and thus ¯VRm → ¯V strongly in Cα(K) for some α > 0. Furthermore, up to
a further extraction of a subsequence, there exist some constants x+, x−, ¯y and ¯α such that
R − kR → x+ ∈ [0, +∞], −R − kR → x− ∈ [−∞, 0],
yR → ¯y ∈ [0, 1], αR → ¯α ∈ [α, C].
Notice also that x+ − x− = +∞. Thanks to the strong convergence of ¯VRm in Cα(K), we
have

(2.20)

Z 1
0 ZTN −1

¯V (¯y + x1, x′) dx1 dx′ = ¯p.

if x+ < +∞ (resp. x− > −∞), then ¯V (x+, x′) = v(x+, x′, p+) (resp.

Furthermore,
¯V (x−, x′) = v(x−, x′, p−)).

We can also pass to the limit in (2.19), thus ¯V is a solution of

−∆ ¯V + divA(x, ¯V ) = 0 on (x−, x+) × TN −1.

Eventually, we have further properties on ¯V from the properties listed in Lemma 2.1 as

follows:

• L∞ bound : v(x, p+) ≤ ¯V (x) ≤ v(x, p−) for all x ∈ R × TN −1;
• Additional regularity: ¯VRm ⇀ ¯V in W 2,q(K) for any compact set K ⊂ (x−, x+) ×
TN −1 and for all q < ∞, and therefore ¯VRm → ¯V strongly in W 1,q(K) for such
compact sets K and for any q ∈ [1, ∞]. Moreover, ¯V ∈ W 1,∞(Ω);

• Integration constant:

(2.21) −

d

dx1 ZTN −1

¯V (x1, x′) dx′ +ZTN −1

A1(x1, x′, ¯V (x1, x′)) dx′ = ¯α ∀x1 ∈ (x−, x+).

13

• Monotony: ¯V (x + e1) ≤ ¯V (x).

⊲ Third step: Limit states of ¯V and value of the integration constant.
Let us consider the sequence (uk)k∈Z deﬁned by

uk : x ∈ [0, 1] × TN −1 7→ ¯V (x + ke1).

Thanks to the monotony property and the a priori bounds for ¯V , the sequence (uk)k∈Z is
monotonous and bounded in W 1,∞([0, 1]× TN −1). Thus for all x ∈ [0, 1]× TN −1, (uk(x))k∈Z
has a ﬁnite limit as k → ±∞, which we denote as u±, and u± is bounded and Lipschitz
continuous.

Since uk(1, x′) = uk+1(0, x′) for all k ∈ Z, we deduce that u±(0, x′) = u±(1, x′) and thus
u± is periodic. Let us now prove that u± = v(·, p±). We consider for instance the function
u+, the argument for u− is strictly identical.

If x+ < ∞, since (2.18) yields

¯VR(x1, x′) = v(x1, x′, p+),

x1 ≥ R − kR, x′ ∈ TN −1

we deduce easily that ¯V (x) = v(x, p+) for all x ∈ (x+, ∞) × TN −1, and as a consequence,
u+ = v(x, p+).

If x+ = +∞, extending u+ by periodicity, we have u+ ∈ C(TN ) and ¯V (· + ke1) → u+

locally uniformly as k → +∞. Since every uk is a solution of

−∆uk + divA(x, uk) = 0,

taking k → ∞ in the above equation, we deduce that u+ is a periodic solution of the
above equation. Therefore there exists ¯p+ ∈ R such that u+ = v(·, ¯p+). Notice that since
v(·, p−) ≤ ¯V ≤ v(·, p+), we have ¯p+ ∈ [p+, ¯p−].
In particular,

−

d

dx1 ZTN −1

u+(x1, x′) dx′ +ZTN −1

A1(x1, x′, u+(x1, x′)) dx′ = ¯A1(¯p+) ∀x1 ∈ T.

Taking the integral of the above identity over T and comparing with (2.21), we obtain
¯A1(¯p+) = ¯α.
Since ¯α ≥ α and ¯p+ ∈ [p+, ¯p−], the assumption (1.7) leads to ¯p+ ∈ {p+, p−} and

(2.22)
Since ¯V (¯y + x1 + k, x′) ≤ ¯V (¯y + x1, x′) for all (x1, x′) ∈ [0, 1] × TN −1 and k ∈ N,

¯α = α = ¯A1(p±).

u+(¯y + x1, x′) ≤ ¯V (¯y + x1, x′) ∀(x1, x′) ∈ [0, 1] × TN −1.

Taking the average of the above inequality over [0, 1] × TN −1, it follows from (2.20) that
¯p+ ≤ ¯p < p−. Therefore ¯p+ = p+.

Hence we conclude that

¯V (x1, x′) − v(x1, x′, p±) → 0

as x1 → ±∞ in L∞(TN −1).

Notice also that since (2.21) is true on (x−, x+) × TN −1, and at least one of the properties
x− = −∞ or x+ = +∞ always holds, it follows from the argument above that (2.22) always
holds.

⊲ Fourth step: Conclusion.
First of all, if x+ = +∞ and x− = −∞, then gathering the properties of the previous
steps, ¯V is a stationary shock with end states v(·, p+) and v(·, p−), thus Theorem 1.1 is
proved.

14

DALIBARD AND KANG

Therefore we now consider the case x+ < +∞ (the case x− > −∞ is treated in a similar

fashion). In this case, we see that the equation

− ∆ ¯V + divA(x, ¯V ) = 0

(2.23)
is satisﬁed on (−∞, x+) × TN −1. Of course, since ¯V (x) = v(x, p+) for all x1 > x+, the
equation is also satisﬁed on (x+, ∞) × TN −1. Notice that ¯V is continuous at the point
x1 = x+, but its derivative in x1 might have a jump, and therefore there might be a Dirac
mass in ∆ ¯V at x1 = x+. We prove that this is not the case.

Thus, using (2.21) and (2.22), we have that

(2.24) −

= ¯A1(p+).

Since ¯V (x−

+, x′) = v(x+, x′, p+), combining (2.24) with (2.25), we get

J(x′) := ∂x1v(x+, x′, p+) − ∂x1

¯V (x−

+, x′).

ZTN −1

J(x′)dx′ = 0.

Moreover, since ¯V (x) ≥ v(x, p+) for all x ∈ R × TN −1, with equality for x1 ≥ x+, we have
¯V has no jump at x1 = x+,
J(x′) ≥ 0 for all x′ ∈ TN −1, consequently J ≡ 0. Thus ∂x1
which implies that the equation (2.23) is satisﬁed over the whole space.
Hence ¯V is a stationary shock with end states v(·, p+) and v(·, p−), which completes the
proof of Theorem 1.1.

Remark 2.2. In fact, the situation where x+ < +∞ (resp. x− > −∞) cannot happen.
Indeed, in that case, w = ¯V − v(x, p+) (resp. w = v(x, p−) − ¯V ) would be the non-negative
solution of an elliptic equation of the type

−∆w + div(aw) = 0

in R × TN −1,

with a ∈ L∞(R × TN −1), and w ≡ 0 for x1 ≥ x+ (resp x1 ≤ x−). Using once again the
Harnack inequality, we infer that w has to vanish identically over R × TN −1, which leads to
a contradiction. Therefore we always have x+ = +∞ and x− = −∞.

3. Properties of stationary shocks with periodic end states

We ﬁrst show that the Rankine-Hugoniot condition (1.6a) is in fact a necessary condition

for the existence of shock waves.
Lemma 3.1. Assume A1 ∈ W 1,∞
v(·, p−) to v(·, p+). Then ¯A1(p−) = ¯A1(p+) =: α, and ¯U satisﬁes

loc (TN × R). Let ¯U be a stationary shock wave connecting

−

d

dx1 ZTN −1

¯U (x1, x′)dx′ +ZTN −1

A1(x1, x′, ¯U (x1, x′))dx′ = α.

15

Proof. Since the shock wave ¯U is a solution of

−∆ ¯U + divA(x, ¯U ) = 0,

there exists a constant ¯C such that

−

d

dx1 ZTN −1

¯U (x)dx′ +ZTN −1

A1(x, ¯U (x))dx′ = ¯C,

∀x1 ∈ R.

Moreover, since

−

d

dx1 ZTN −1

v(x, p+)dx′ +ZTN −1

A1(x, v(x, p+))dx′ = ¯A1(p+),

we have
(3.26)

dx1 ZTN −1 (cid:16) ¯U (x)−v(x, p+)(cid:17)dx′+ZTN −1 (cid:16)A1(x, ¯U (x))−A1(x, v(x, p+))(cid:17)dx′ = ¯C − ¯A1(p+).
Notice that (1.5) and A1 ∈ W 1,∞
loc (TN × R) yield that for any ε ∈ (0, 1), there exists m > 0
such that for all x1 > m,
| ¯U (x) − v(x, p+)| ≤ ε,

|A1(x, ¯U (x)) − A1(x, v(x, p+))| ≤ εk∂vA1kL∞(TN ×(−K,K)),

where the constant K is such that K ≥ kv(·, p+)k∞ + 1. Thus, integrating (3.26) over
[m, m + 1], we have that

| ¯C − ¯A1(p+)| ≤ Cε ∀ε ∈ (0, 1),

which implies that ¯C = ¯A1(p+). Similarly, applying the above argument to v(·, p−), we
have ¯C = ¯A1(p−).
(cid:3)

If we impose additional conditions on the ﬂux A at the two end states, the shock wave

exponentially converges towards the end states:
Proposition 3.1. Let ¯U be a stationary shock wave connecting v(·, p−) to v(·, p+) satisfying
v(·, p+) ≤ ¯U ≤ v(·, p−). Assume that A1 ∈ (W 1,∞
loc ∩C1)(TN ×R) and that there exist periodic
functions φ ∈ L1(T) and ψ ∈ L1(T) such that the Lax conditions (1.9), (1.10) are satisﬁed.

Then there exist positive constants R and CR such that for all ±x1 > R,

ZTN −1

| ¯U (x1, x′) − v(x1, x′, p±)|dx′ < CR ea±x1/2ZTN −1

| ¯U (±R, x′) − v(±R, x′, p±)|dx′.

Proof. We show the convergence towards the left end state v(·, p−). First of all, we see that
Lemma 3.1 yields

| ¯U (x) − v(x, p−)|dx′

It follows from (1.5) that

∂vA1(x, τ ¯U + (1 − τ )v(x, p−))dτ(cid:19) (v(x, p−) − ¯U (x))dx′.

∀ε > 0, ∃R > 0 s.t.

| ¯U (x) − v(x, p−)| < ε

for all x1 < −R, x′ ∈ TN −1.

16

DALIBARD AND KANG

Since the function ∂vA1 is continuous, using (1.9), we infer that there exists a constant C
such that

∂vA1(x, τ ¯U + (1 − τ )v(x, p−)) ≥ φ(x1) − Cε

for all x1 < −R, x′ ∈ TN −1, τ ∈ [0, 1].

Thus for all x1 < −R,

d

dx1 ZTN −1

| ¯U (x) − v(x, p−)|dx′ ≥ (φ(x1) − Cε)ZTN −1

| ¯U (x) − v(x, p−)|dx′.

This inequality implies that for all x1 < −R

ZTN −1

| ¯U (x) − v(x, p−)|dx′ < ZTN −1

| ¯U (x) − v(x, p−)|dx′(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x1=−R

Since the periodicity of φ implies that there exists a positive constant C such that

φ(s)ds ≤ (x1 + R)ZT

φ(s)ds + C,

we have the desired estimate for the case of v(x, p−), choosing ε so that a− − Cε ≥ a−/2.
The same arguments also lead to the convergence towards v(·, p+) as x1 → +∞.
(cid:3)
Lemma 3.2. Assume A ∈ W 1,∞
loc (TN × R)N satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 1.1,
together with (1.7). Let ¯U and ¯V be two stationary shock waves connecting v(·, p−) to
v(·, p+). Then ¯U and ¯V enjoy the following properties:

• The function ¯U − ¯V keeps a constant sign;
• ¯U − τ1 ¯U ≥ 0, ¯V − τ1 ¯V ≥ 0;
• There exist k−, k+ ∈ Z, with either k+ = 0 or k− = 0, such that

τk−

¯U ≤ ¯V ≤ τk+

¯U ;

• ¯U − ¯V ∈ L1(R × TN −1).

Remark 3.1. The ﬁrst statement of Lemma 3.2 implies that stationary shocks are ordered
in the sense that any two shocks ¯U and ¯V satisfy only one of ¯U = ¯V , ¯U < ¯V and ¯U > ¯V .
Proof. Let us ﬁrst prove that ¯U − ¯V keeps a constant sign. Assume for instance that
¯U (0) ≤ ¯V (0). Using the same argument as the one developed from (2.16), we have that
W := ¯U − ¯V satisﬁes

−∆|W | + divx(cid:16)sgn(W )(cid:0)A(x, ¯U ) − A(x, ¯V )(cid:1)(cid:17) ≤ 0 in D′(R × TN −1).

We denote by −m the left hand-side of the above inequality. Then m is a non-negative
measure. But since

lim

x1→±∞

k ¯U (x1, ·) − ¯V (x1, ·)kL∞(TN −1) = 0,

we have that m(R × TN −1) = 0. Thus,

−∆|W | + divx(cid:16)sgn(W )(cid:0)A(x, ¯U ) − A(x, ¯V )(cid:1)(cid:17) = 0.

That is, |W | is a non-negative solution of an elliptic equation of the type:

−∆|W | + divx (a|W |) = 0,

where

a := Z 1

0

∂vA(x, τ ¯U + (1 − τ ) ¯V )dτ ∈ L∞(R × TN −1).

17

As a consequence, Harnack’s inequality implies that either W is identically zero, or W never
vanishes. Thus there are two possibilities:

• If ¯U (0) = ¯V (0), then W ≡ 0 and ¯U = ¯V ;
• If ¯U (0) < ¯V (0), then W never vanishes and ¯V − ¯U remains strictly positive. In that

case

v(x, p+) < ¯U (x) < ¯V (x) < v(x, p−),

∀x ∈ R × TN −1.

Hence the ﬁrst statement of the Lemma is proved.

Concerning the second statement, observe that τ1 ¯U and τ1 ¯V are also stationary shock
waves connecting v(·, p−) to v(·, p+). As a consequence, according to the ﬁrst statement,
¯U − τ1 ¯U and ¯V − τ1 ¯V keep a constant sign.
It follows that the sequences of functions
(τk ¯U )k∈Z, (τk ¯V )k∈Z are monotonous, and using assumption (1.7), we infer that these se-
quences are necessarily non-increasing. Hence ¯U − τ1 ¯U ≥ 0, ¯V − τ1 ¯V ≥ 0.

We now address the third statement. Once again, without loss of generality, we assume
that ¯U ≤ ¯V , so that k− = 0. Moreover, since the sequence ( ¯U (ke1))k∈Z is monotonous, we
have

τk ¯U (x) → v(x, p−)

as k → −∞ in L∞([0, 1] × TN −1)

Thus there exists k+ ∈ Z, k+ ≤ 0, such that for all x ∈ [0, 1] × TN −1,

¯V (x) ≤ τk+

¯U (x).

Using the ﬁrst statement and the fact that τk+

¯U is a standing shock, we infer that ¯V ≤ τk+

Eventually, still working under the assumption ¯U ≤ ¯V , we have, for any K > 0,

Proposition 3.2. Assume that the assumptions of Theorem 1.1 are satisﬁed, together with
the Lax assumptions (1.9)-(1.10). Assume furthermore that ∂vA, ∂2

loc (TN × R).
Let ¯U be a stationary shock wave connecting v(·, p−) to v(·, p+). Let q ∈ R be arbitrary.
Then there exists a unique shock ¯V ∈ ¯U + L1(R × TN −1) such that RR×TN −1( ¯V − ¯U ) = q.

Remark 3.2. The sole purpose of assumptions (1.9)-(1.10) is to ensure that the family
(pR)R>0 deﬁned by (3.28) below is equi-integrable, and therefore compact with respect to R.
If this compactness property can be retrieved in another way, then assumptions (1.9)-(1.10)
can be removed from the statement of Proposition 3.2.

v A ∈ W 1,∞

Proposition 3.2 has the following immediate consequence:

Corollary 3.1. Let p−, p+ be constants such that the assumptions of Theorem 1.1 are
satisﬁed. Assume that (1.9)-(1.10) hold, and let ¯U be a stationary shock wave connecting
v(·, p−) to v(·, p+). If u ∈ ¯U + L1(R × TN −1), then there exists a unique standing shock ¯V
such that u ∈ ¯V + L1

0(R × TN −1).

We now turn to the proof of Proposition 3.2. The proof relies heavily on properties of

the function ¯U (· + e1) − ¯U , which we list in the following Lemma:

loc (TN × R). Let ¯U be a stationary shock wave connecting v(·, p−) to v(·, p+), and let

Then p satisﬁes the following properties:

p := ¯U − ¯U (· + e1).

• Setting

b(x) = Z 1

0

∂vA(x, s ¯U (x) + (1 − s) ¯U (x + e1)) ds ∈ W 1,∞(Ω),

the function p is a non-negative solution of

(3.27)

− ∆p + div(bp) = 0

in R × TN −1;

Moreover, p ∈ L1 ∩ W 1,∞(R × TN −1).

• For any R > 1, consider the approximate problem

in (−R, R) × TN −1,
−∂1pR + b1pR = 0 at x1 = ±R,

ZΩR

pR = ZΩ

p.

Then equation (3.28) has a unique solution pR ∈ H 1(ΩR). Moreover, pR(x) > 0
for all x ∈ ΩR, and if pR is extended by zero outside ΩR, the family (pR)R>0 is
uniformly bounded in Lq(Ω) for all 1 ≤ q < ∞.

• Assume that the Lax conditions (1.9)-(1.10) are satisﬁed. Then

pR → p as R → ∞, in L1(R × TN −1).

Proof. • Properties of p:
the integrability, sign and regularity properties of p follow from
Lemma 3.2 and from the regularity properties of ¯U . The equation on p simply follows from
making the diﬀerence between the equations on τ1 ¯U and ¯U .

• Properties of pR: existence, uniqueness and positivity are a consequence of the Krein-
Rutman theorem (see Appendix). The uniform L1 bound follows from the normalization
and the positivity. We then obtain H 1 bounds by multiplying (3.28) by pR and integrating
by parts. We obtain

Using ﬁrst a trace inequality and then the Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality, we

• Asymptotic behaviour of pR when the Lax conditions are satisﬁed: we ﬁrst obtain

plies together with Harnack inequality that p(x1, ·) converges exponentially fast towards
zero in L∞(TN −1) as x1 → ±∞, and b1 therefore converges exponentially fast towards
∂vA(x, v(x, p±)) in L∞(TN −1) as x1 → ±∞. The Lax conditions (1.9)-(1.10) imply that for
any ε < max(|a+|, |a−|)/2, there exists K > 0 such that

b1(x) ≥ φ(x1) − ε

for x1 < −K,

b1(x) ≤ ψ(x1) + ε

for x1 > K.

Thus, if K < x1 < R, we obtain, since pR > 0,

As a consequence, there exists a constant C such that

We also obtain similar estimates on (−R, −K). Using the Harnack inequality, we deduce
eventually that there exists a constant C (independent of R) such that

C −1 exp(a−x1/2) ≤ pR(x)

if x1 < 0,

pR(x) ≤ C exp(a+x1/2)

if x1 > 0.

Furthermore, if we consider

ϕ+ := inf

x′∈TN −1

∂vA1(x1, x′, v(x1, x′, p+)), ϕ− := sup

x′∈TN −1

∂vA1(x1, x′, v(x1, x′, p−)),

then (1.9)-(1.10) imply that b+ := RT ϕ+dx1 < 0 and b− := RT ϕ−dx1 > 0, and using the

above arguments, we obtain that

pR(x) ≤ C exp(b−x1/2)

if x1 < 0, C −1 exp(b+x1/2) ≤ pR(x)

if x1 > 0.

20

DALIBARD AND KANG

Hence, the sequence (pR)R>1 is equi-integrable. Using the uniform H 1 estimate, we deduce
that (pR)R>1 is compact in L1(Ω). By uniqueness (up to a multiplicative constant) of the
solutions of (3.27), it follows that pR → p in L1(Ω).

(cid:3)
Remark 3.3. Obviously, the same statements hold for pk := | ¯U (·+ ke1)− ¯U | for any k ∈ Z,
replacing every occurrence of ¯U (· + e1) by ¯U (· + ke1).

We are now ready to prove Proposition 3.2:

3.1. Proof of Proposition 3.2. Let q ∈ R be ﬁxed. Notice ﬁrst that if there exist two
0(Ω) and ¯V1 − ¯V2 keeps a
shocks ¯V1, ¯V2 with R ( ¯V1 − ¯U ) = R ( ¯V2 − ¯U ) = q, then ¯V1 − ¯V2 ∈ L1
constant sign according to Lemma 3.2. Hence ¯V1 = ¯V2. The uniqueness of ¯V follows. We
therefore focus on the existence of ¯V in the rest of the proof.
First, there exists an integer k ∈ Z such that q has the same sign as ¯U (· + ke1) − ¯U , and

|q| ≤ k ¯U (· + ke1) − ¯U kL1 = kpkkL1 .

In order to ﬁx ideas, we work with q > 0, so that k < 0 and pk = ¯U (· + ke1) − ¯U . In the
sequel, we set

bk(x) = Z 1

0

∂vA(x, (1 − s) ¯U (x) + s ¯U(x + ke1)) ds ∈ W 1,∞(Ω).

The goal is to prove that for all q ∈ R, the following equation has at least one solution

(3.29)

− ∆W + divB(x, W ) = 0

in Ω, W ∈ L1(Ω), ZΩ

W = q,

where B(x, r) = A(x, ¯U + r) − A(x, ¯U ). Setting W = ¯V − ¯U , this is strictly equivalent to
the statement of Proposition 3.2.

In order to require that RΩ W = q, we slightly modify the form of equation (3.29) and

rather look for solutions of the equation

(3.30)

− ∆W + div(bkW ) + div ˜Bk(x, W ) = 0, W ∈ L1(Ω), ZΩ

W = q

where ˜Bk(x, r) = ˜A(x, ¯U +r)− ˜A(x, ¯U )−bk(x)r. Here, ˜A is deﬁned by ˜A(x, r) := A(x, r)χ(r),
where χ ∈ C∞
0 (R) such that χ(r) = 1 for |r| ≤ r0 for some large constant r0 with r0 >
2kv(·, p±)k∞, thus ˜A ∈ W 1,∞(TN × R). It is clear that if W ∈ L1 is a solution of (3.30),
then ¯V = W + ¯U is a standing shock for the ﬂux ˜A, with periodic end states v(·, p±). As
a consequence, v(·, p+) ≤ ¯V ≤ v(·, p−), and thus ˜A(x, ¯V (x)) = A(x, ¯V (x)). Whence ¯V is a
standing shock for the ﬂux A such that R ( ¯V − ¯U) = q.

Notice also that there exists a constant C such that

and that for all r ∈ R, x ∈ Ω, since ∂2

We prove the existence of solutions of (3.30) by using approximate problems on ΩR and
passing to the limit as R → ∞. Using Lemma 3.2, we ﬁrst introduce the function pk,R
which solves

− ∆pk,R + div(bkpk,R) = 0 in ΩR,

(3.32)

− ∂1pk,R + bk,1pk,R = 0 for x1 = ±R, ZΩR

pk,R = ZΩ

pk.

We recall that pk,R > 0 in ΩR. We deﬁne

˜Bk,R(x, r) = χR(x1)r(r − pk,R)Z 1

0 Z 1

0

˜A(x, ¯U + sτ r + s(1 − τ )pk(x)) dτ ds

for some cut-oﬀ function χR such that χR ≡ 1 on (−R + 1, R − 1) and Supp χR ⊂ (−R +
1/2, R − 1/2).

We now prove that for all R > 1, there exists a solution WR ∈ H 1(ΩR) of the equation

(3.33)

−∆WR + div(bkWR) + div ˜Bk,R(x, WR) = 0 in ΩR,
−∂1WR + bk,1WR = 0 for x1 = ±R,

ZΩR

WR = q.

Let us solve equation (3.33) by using Schaefer’s ﬁxed point theorem. Let W1 ∈ H 1(ΩR)

be arbitrary. We use the Fredholm alternative to solve the equation

(3.34)

−∆W2 + div(bkW2) + div ˜Bk,R(x, W1) = 0 in ΩR,
−∂1W2 + bk,1W2 = 0 for x1 = ±R,

ZΩR

W2 = q.

Indeed, according to Lemma A.1, the solutions of the homogeneous equation

(3.35)

− ∆w + div(bkw) = 0 in ΩR, −∂1w + bk,1w = 0 for x1 = ±R

are the functions w = cpk,R where pk,R > 0, c ∈ R. Since the dual problem of (3.35) is

−∆q − bk · ∇q = 0

in ΩR,

∂1q = 0 for x1 = ±R,

and a simple computation gives

ZΩR

pk,R|∇q|2dx = 0,

the solutions of the dual problem are the constants. Thus, the inhomogeneous term
−div ˜Bk,R(x, W1) of (3.34) is orthogonal to the constants thanks to the cut-oﬀ function
χR. This ensures the existence of solutions of the ﬁrst two lines of (3.34); these solutions
are deﬁned up to a function of the form cpk,R, for c ∈ R, and the third line of (3.34) ﬁxes
the value c and ensures uniqueness of solutions of (3.34). Hence we can deﬁne the operator
LR : W1 ∈ L2(ΩR) 7→ W2 ∈ L2(ΩR). Notice that in fact, the operator LR is continuous from
L2(ΩR) to H 1(ΩR), and therefore LR is compact for all R > 0. Now, let λ ∈ [0, 1] be arbi-
trary, and let W λ be such that λLR(W λ) = W λ. We ﬁrst observe that since ˜Bk,R(x, 0) = 0,

22

DALIBARD AND KANG

(W λ)+ := W λ1W λ≥0 satisﬁes

−∆(W λ)+ + div(bk(W λ)+) + λdiv(cid:16)1W λ>0

˜Bk,R(x, W λ)(cid:17) ≤ 0 in ΩR,
−∂1(W λ)+ + bk,1(W λ)+ = 0 for x1 = ±R.

Using once again an argument similar to the one developed form (2.16), we deduce that
W λ keeps a constant sign on ΩR. Thus

(3.36)

kW λkL1(ΩR) = Z W λ = q > 0.

We derive an uniform H 1 bound on W λ in the following way: we have

ZΩR

|∇W λ|2 −ZΩR

bkW λ · ∇W λ = λZΩR

˜Bk,R(x, W λ) · ∇W λ.

Using trace estimates together with the Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation as in the proof
of Lemma 3.2, we have that for any ν > 0 there exists Cν > 0 such that

˜Bk,R(x, W λ) · ∇W λ = div(cid:16)βk,R(x, W λ)(cid:17) − (divxβk,R)(x, W λ).

Since βk,R(±R, x′, r) = 0 for all x′, r,

ZΩR

˜Bk,R(x, W λ) · ∇W λdx = −ZΩR

Using Young’s inequality together with the L1 bound (3.36) on W λ, we infer that there

exists a constant C independent of λ and R, such that
kW λkH 1(ΩR) ≤ C.

Therefore, it follows from Schaefer’s theorem that (3.33) has a solution WR ∈ H 1 ∩ L1(ΩR).
Moreover, using the estimates above for λ = 1, we deduce that the family (WR)R>0 is
bounded in H 1 ∩ L1(ΩR) uniformly in R.

23

Furthermore, we claim that

(3.37)

0 ≤ WR ≤ pk,R ∀R.

The positivity of WR has been proved above. As for the upper-bound, we notice that by
deﬁnition of ˜Bk,R, ˜Bk,R(x, pk,R) ≡ 0, and thus it follows from (3.32) that pk,R is a solution
of

−∆pk,R + div(bkpk,R) + div ˜Bk,R(x, pk,R) = 0 in ΩR,
−∂1pk,R + bk,1pk,R = 0 for x1 = ±R.

Using the same argument as the one leading to the positivity of WR, we deduce that
WR − pk,R keeps a constant sign over ΩR. By deﬁnition of k,

q = ZΩR

WR ≤ ZΩ

pk = ZΩR

pk,R,

we deduce that WR − pk,R ≤ 0.

We can now pass to the limit in (3.33) as R → ∞. According to the uniform H 1 ∩ L1
bounds, we deduce that there exists W ∈ H 1 ∩ L1(Ω) such that WR ⇀ W in H 1(Ω), and
loc(Ω) up to a subsequence. Since pk,R → pk in L1 according to Lemma 3.2,
WR → W in L2
we deduce that W is a solution of

−∆W + div(bkW ) + div ˜Bk(x, W ) = 0.

Eventually, using inequality (3.37) together with the convergence in L1 of the functions
pk,R, we deduce that (WR)R>0 is uniformly equi-integrable, and therefore compact in L1.
Hence, up to a further extraction of subsequences, WR → W in L1 and

Z W = lim

R→∞Z WR = q.

Thus the existence of solutions of (3.30) is proved, which completes the proof of Proposition
3.2.

4. Stability of stationary shocks

The goal of this section is to prove Theorem 1.2. Throughout the section, we denote
by (St)t≥0 the semi-group associated with equation (1.1). We recall (see for instance [22])
that St is well-deﬁned in L1(Ω) + L∞(Ω), is order preserving and satisﬁes conservation and
contraction principles in L1(Ω): if u, v ∈ L1(Ω) + L∞(Ω) are such that u − v ∈ L1(Ω), then
Stu − Stv ∈ L1(Ω) for all t ≥ 0 and

ZΩ

(Stu − Stv) = ZΩ

(u − v),

kStu − StvkL1 ≤ ku − vkL1 ∀t ≥ 0.

First of all, Corollary 3.1 allows us to restrict the proof of Theorem 1.2 to the case of

zero-mass perturbation u0 ∈ ¯U + L1

0(R × TN −1).

On the other hand, the following lemma allows us to replace the inequality (1.8) by an

inequality where the upper bound and lower bounds are standing shocks.
Lemma 4.1. Let ¯U be a stationary shock wave connecting v(·, p−) to v(·, p+). Assume that
u ∈ ¯U + L1

0(R × TN −1) satisﬁes v(x, p+) ≤ u(x) ≤ v(x, p−) for a.e. x ∈ R × TN −1.

24

DALIBARD AND KANG

Then, for any ε > 0, there exist a function uε ∈ ¯U + L1
connecting v(·, p−) to v(·, p+) such that

0(R × TN −1) and standing shocks U ε
±

ku − uεkL1(R×TN −1) ≤ ε, U ε

+ ≤ uε ≤ U ε
−.

The case of N = 1 above (i.e., R instead of R × TN −1) has been shown in [5, Lemma 3.6],
whose proof can be directly extended to the above lemma, because other variables x′ are in
TN −1. The idea is to take uε = ¯U outside of a compact set [−Aε, Aε] × TN −1 and then to
perturb slightly u on the compact set [−Aε, Aε] × TN −1 in order to be strictly between the
two end states. We leave the details of the proof to the reader since they are identical to
[5, Lemma 3.6].

Now, thanks to Lemma 4.1 together with the L1-contraction principle, it is enough to

U+ ≤ u0 ≤ U−,

prove Theorem 1.2 for the class of initial data u0 ∈ ¯U + L1
(4.38)
Indeed, assume that limt→∞ kStv0 − ¯U kL1(R×TN −1) = 0 for any v0 ∈ ¯U + L1
satisfying (4.38). By Lemma 4.1, for any u0 ∈ ¯U + L1
ε > 0, there exists a function uε
and (4.38). Then the L1-contraction principle yields that for all t ≥ 0,

0(R × TN −1) such that ku0 − uε

0(R × TN −1)
0(R × TN −1) satisfying (1.8), and
0kL1(R×TN −1) ≤ ε

for some standing shocks U±.

0(R × TN −1) such that

0 ∈ ¯U + L1

kStu0 − ¯U kL1(Ω) ≤ kStu0 − Stuε

0kL1(Ω) + kStuε

0 − ¯U kL1(Ω) ≤ ε + kStuε

0 − ¯U kL1(Ω).

Since t 7→ kStu0 − ¯U kL1 is non-increasing, and thus has a ﬁnite limit as t → ∞,

which implies that limt→∞ kStu0 − ¯U kL1(R×TN −1) = 0.

lim
t→∞

kStu0 − ¯U kL1(R×TN −1) ≤ ε,

Therefore, there remains to prove Theorem 1.2 for the initial data u0 ∈ ¯U +L1

0(R× TN −1)
satisfying (4.38). We follows the same arguments as [5], which is based on the dynamical
system theory due to Osher and Ralston [21]. The strategy is to prove that the ω-limit set
of the trajectory Stu0 is reduced to { ¯U } using the L1-contraction principle. Thus, we need
to ﬁrst show that the ω-limit set is non-empty.

⊲ First step : Structure of the ω-limit set.
We begin by noticing that the comparison principle together with (4.38) imply that for

all t ≥ 0,

and thus, setting w(t) = Stu0 − ¯U ,

U+ ≤ Stu0 ≤ U−,

U+ − ¯U ≤ w(t) ≤ U− − ¯U .

Since U+ − ¯U and U− − ¯U are in L1 ∩ L∞(R × TN −1) by Lemma 3.2, the family (w(t))t≥0
is equi-integrable in L1(R × TN −1) and uniformly bounded in L∞([0, ∞) × Ω). Moreover,
since w solves a linear parabolic equation of the type

∂tw + divx(cid:16)a(t, x)w(cid:17) − ∆w = 0,

0 ∂vA(x, τ Stu0 + (1 − τ ) ¯U )dτ ∈ L∞([0, ∞) × Ω), it follows from [14, Theorem

where a := R 1

10.1] that there exists α > 0 such that for all t0 ≥ 1 and R > 1,
kwkH α/2,α((t0,t0+1)×(−R,R)×TN −1) < ∞.

Thus, (w(t))t≥0 is also equi-continuous in L1.
Therefore, it follows from the Riesz-Fr´echet-Kolmogorov theorem that (w(t))t≥0 is relatively
compact in L1. Thus the ω-limit set

25

B := nW ∈ ¯U + L1

0(Ω) | ∃(tn)n∈N, tn → ∞, Stnu0 → W in L1(Ω)o,

0(Ω) because of u0 ∈ ¯U + L1

is non-empty. Notice that B ⊂ ¯U + L1
of mass.
By the deﬁnition of ω-limit set, B is forward and backward invariant by the semi-group
St, i.e., StB = B for all t. Moreover, thanks to parabolic regularity, all functions in B are
smooth, for example B ⊂ H 1
loc(Ω). As a consequence, for any W ∈ B, it follows from [14,
Theorem 6.1] that StW ∈ L2(0, T ; H 2

0(Ω) and the conservation

loc(Ω)) ∩ H 1(0, T ; L2

loc(Ω)).

We take advantage of LaSalle invariance principle [15] with a suitable Lyapunov func-
tional F [u] := ku − ¯U kL1(Ω). Since t 7→ F [StW ] is non-increasing by the L1-contraction
principle, F takes a constant value on B, which we denote by C0.

⊲ Second step : B = { ¯U }. We now prove B = { ¯U }. For any W0 ∈ B, we set W (t) = StW0.

Notice that W (t) ∈ Ω for all t ≥ 0. Since W (t) − ¯U satisﬁes

we have

(4.39)

∂t(W − ¯U ) + divx(cid:16)A(x, W ) − A(x, ¯U )(cid:17) − ∆(W − ¯U ) = 0,

∂t|W − ¯U | + divx(cid:16)b(t, x)|W − ¯U |(cid:17) − sgn(W − ¯U )∆(W − ¯U ) = 0,

where b(t, x) = R 1

0 ∂vA(x, τ W + (1 − τ ) ¯U )dτ .

In order to show that sgn(W − ¯U )∆(W − ¯U ) = ∆|W − ¯U |, we use the following lemma.

Lemma 4.2. Let f ∈ L1 ∩ L∞(R × TN −1) such that ∇f ∈ L2(R × TN −1) and ∆f ∈
L1
loc(R × TN −1). Assume that f satisﬁes

therefore,

The case of N = 1 above has been shown in [5, Lemma B.1], whose proof can be directly
extended to the above lemma. Now, in order to show that the condition (4.40) is satisﬁed
in our case, we recall from the previous step that F [W (t)] = kW (t) − ¯U kL1(Ω) = C0 for all
t ≥ 0. For any t′ > t ≥ 0, since

Thus, a slightly modiﬁed version of Lemma 4.2 implies that

sgn(W − ¯U )∆(W − ¯U ) = ∆|W − ¯U |.

Therefore, |W − ¯U | is a non-negative solution of a parabolic equation of the type

∂t|W − ¯U | + divx(cid:16)b(t, x)|W − ¯U |(cid:17) − ∆|W − ¯U | = 0,

where b ∈ L∞([0, ∞) × Ω). Thanks to the Harnack inequality for the parabolic equations,
for any compact set K in Ω, there exists CK such that

(4.41)

sup
x∈K

|(W0 − ¯U )(x)| ≤ CK inf

|(W (1) − ¯U )(x)|.

Moreover, using the fact that W (1) − ¯U ∈ L1

loc(Ω), there exists x1 ∈ Ω such that

(W (1) − ¯U )(x1) = 0,

which implies together with (4.41) that W0 ≡ V . Hence we have B = { ¯U }, and thus
complete the proof of Theorem 1.2.

Appendix A. use of the Krein-Rutman theorem to prove the positivity of

solutions of some elliptic equations

In this Appendix, we prove the following result, which has been used in several instances

in the paper:

Lemma A.1. Let R > 0 be arbitrary, and let b ∈ L∞(ΩR). Consider the equation

(A.1)

−∆w + div(bw) = 0

in ΩR,
−∂1w + b1w = 0 for x1 = ±R.

Then the vector space of solutions of equation (A.1) is Rw1, where w1 ∈ H 1(ΩR) ∩ C( ¯ΩR)
is a strictly positive solution of (A.1) such that RΩR

w1 = 1.

Proof. The dual of problem (A.1) is

−∆q − b · ∇q = 0 in (−R, R) × TN −1,
∂1q = 0 at x1 = ±R,

of which the constant function equal to one is a strictly positive solution.

Let us introduce the operator F : u ∈ L2(ΩR) 7→ v ∈ L2(ΩR) where v = F (u) is the

unique solution of the equation

−∆v − b · ∇v + αv = αu in ΩR,

∂1v = 0 at x1 = ±R,

and α is a positive constant chosen so that the bilinear form associated to F is coercive
(e.g. α = ||b||2

2 ). With that choice of α, F is a strictly positive operator.

2 + 1

27

Next, using regularity results for linear elliptic equations, we show that F maps Lq(ΩR)
into W 2,q(ΩR) for all q ≥ 2. Hence, the restriction of F to C( ¯ΩR), still denoted by F , is
a compact operator from C( ¯ΩR) into itself. The last step consists in using the strong form
of the maximum principle together with Hopf’s Lemma: if u ∈ C( ¯ΩR), u ≥ 0, u 6= 0 and
v = F (u), then v(y) > 0 for all y ∈ ¯ΩR.

Hence, F : C( ¯ΩR) → C( ¯ΩR) is a strongly positive operator. We conclude by using the
strong form of the Krein-Rutman theorem (see [7, 13]): since F (¯1) = ¯1, the spectral radius
of F is equal to 1 and 1 is a simple eigenvalue of F ∗, the adjoint of F , with a positive
eigenvector. We infer that (A.1) has a unique non-negative solution w1 normalized in L1.
