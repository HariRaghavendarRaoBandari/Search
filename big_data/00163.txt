We study the ground state properties of spin-half bosons subjected to the Rashba spin-

orbit coupling in two dimensions. Due to the enhancement of the low energy density of

states, it is expected that the eﬀect of interaction becomes more important. After reviewing

several possible ideal condensed states, we carry out an exact diagonalization calculation for

a cluster of the bosons in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling on a two-dimensional

disk and reveal strong correlations in its ground state. We derive a low-energy eﬀective

Hamiltonian to understand how states with strong correlations become energetically more

favorable than the ideal condensed states.

INTRODUCTION

2

A paradigm of traditional bosonic quantum liquid is that of Helium-4. At low temperature,

Helium-4 is an inert element with no relevant internal degrees of freedom. At zero temperature,

about 10% of the Helium atoms condense into the lowest energy state with zero momentum [1]. The

eﬀects of the inter-atomic interaction do not destroy the basic phenomena of Bose condensation

which was ﬁrst predicted for noninteracting bosons, even though signiﬁcant depletion is resulted

from inter-particle scattering [2, 3]. Another general feature of Helium-4 in bulk is that it obeys

Galilean invariance, which plays a crucial role in Landau’s formulation of the two ﬂuid model for

liquid Helium-4 [4, 5].

In 1995, Bose-Einstein condensation was realized in cold atomic gases. The observed atomic

condensates are very close to an “ideal” condensate for noninteracting bosons since the inter-

atomic interactions are usually very weak. With the advent of synthetic spin-orbit coupling in

cold atomic gases, the study of bosonic quantum liquid is greatly expanded in several aspects [6–

11]. First of all, alkali elements like 87Rb usually have multiple internal hyperﬁne states, and

in an optical trap all of them can be active and this leads to multitude of quantum phases in

the so-called spinor condensate [12–16]. Secondly, the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling further

introduces the coupling between the spin and momentum degrees of freedom and signiﬁcantly

modiﬁes the single particle dispersion relation. In the experimentally realized case of spin-orbit

coupling along one-dimension [17–31], this coupling leads to the so-called stripe and plane wave

condensate in homogeneous systems and in harmonic traps [32–38] and the associated tricritical

point [39]. Thirdly, for certain symmetric spin-orbit coupling, of Rashba or Weyl form, the low

energy density of states is signiﬁcantly enhanced such that the eﬀects of interaction have drastic

eﬀects on the existence of Bose condensate and could in fact destroy its existence [40, 41]. Lastly,

the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling breaks the Galilean invariance which makes the construction

of two-ﬂuid model much more involved [42–45].

In this paper, we consider spin-half bosons subjected to the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in two-

dimensions. We will concentrate on the interplay between the enhanced single particle ground state

degeneracy and the eﬀects of strong repulsive interactions. In an inﬁnite system, the Rashba spin-

orbit coupling gives rise to a ring of inﬁnitely degenerate single particle states. We show that in the

truncated Hilbert space spanned by the single particle states on the ring, trial wave-functions for

two and four bosons with strong correlations built-in can have lower interaction energy than various

ideal condensed states. However, for strong inter-particle interaction, it is also important to take

3

into account the transverse excitations away from the degenerate ring. We consider explicitly a

disk of radius R and carry out exact diagonalization calculations for a cluster of bosons in this ﬁnite

disk. We ﬁnd numerical evidences for the correlated nature of the ground state. We derive a low-

energy eﬀective Hamiltonian in the strong spin-orbit coupling limit and use it to understand why

the ground state of the interacting bosons exhibit strong correlations, analogous to one-dimensional

Mott insulators and quantum Hall states [46, 47].

The paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. II, we discuss the general feature of a spin-half

boson subjected to Rashba spin-orbit coupling in two-dimensional space and obtain its single

particle eigen-spectrum and density of states for later discussions.

In Sec. III, we list a host

of possible condensate states and calculate their energies.

In Sec. IV A, we discuss a trial two-

body wave-functions that totally avoid interactions. In Sec. IV B, we discuss the possibilities of

correlated ground states in the four-particle case and show that the proposed correlated state is

lower in energy than the best condensate states considered in Sec. III. All the above discussions are

based on trial wave functions constructed from the lowest degenerate ring. We then highlight the

inadequacy of constructing trial states only from the degenerate ground states on the ring without

considering transverse excitation (ﬁnite kinetic energy) when interaction becomes strong. In Sec.V,

we take into account the transverse excitation and perform exact diagonalization calculation of a

cluster of bosons on a disk. To understand the result obtained, we derive an eﬀective many-body

Hamiltonian in the limit of strong spin-orbit coupling in Sec.V B. Two appendices (Sec.VII) are

given. In Sec.A, we discuss the exact solution of single particle states on a disk and in Sec.B, we

discuss the detailed construction of the low energy eﬀective Hamiltonian.

II. GENERAL SETUP

In the presence of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, the single-particle Hamiltonian in two di-

mensions (2D) is given by

Hkin =

ˆp2
x + ˆp2
y
2µ

+ λ(σx ˆpy − σy ˆpx),

(1)

where ˆpx(y) is the momentum along x(y)-direction, µ is the mass of the boson, λ is the strength of

the spin-orbit coupling and σx(y) is the x(y)-Pauli matrix acting on two internal states of a boson.

There are two branches of single-particle eigenstates

χ±,p(r) =

coupling in two dimensions. The locus of lowest energy states lies in the circle with |p| = µλ and its spin
direction is indicated in (A). The two branches of the single particle spectrum touch at kx = ky = 0 at E = 0.

(B) A cut of the energy spectrum along one angular direction. It is shown that the lowest energy is given by
Emin = −µλ2/2 at |p| = µλ. The curvature of the lower branch at the minimal energy is given by 1/µ and
the dispersion becomes sharper as µ → 0. (C) The density of states D(E) resembles one-dimensional system
with characteristic ∼ 1/pE + µλ2/2 divergence for negative energy, and remains a constant for E > 0, the

whose eigenvalues are ǫ±,p = p2/2µ ± λ|p| [see Fig. 1 (A-B)]. Here Ω is the area of the two-
dimensional system, zp = eiϕp with ϕp being the polar angle of p, i.e., px = p cos ϕp and py =
p sin ϕp. The minimum of the lower Rashba band occurs at |p| = µλ. Note that Lz + Sz is a

good quantum number with S = σ/2. Using the fact that exp(ip · r) =Pm imJm(pr) exp(imθ),

where θ is the angle between p and r, it is straightforward to show that the alternative spinor

wave-functions (not normalized)

satisfy

(Lz + Sz)χ±,p,m = (m + 1/2)χ±,p,m,

where Jm(x) is the m-th order Bessel function, and ϕr is the polar angle of r with respect to p.

One consequence of the inclusion of the Rashba spin-orbit interaction is that the low energy

density of states is signiﬁcantly enhanced; see Fig. 1 (C). The density of states D(E) can be

conveniently computed by counting the number of states with energy below E, namely N (E) =

Pk[θ(E− ǫ−,k) + θ(E− ǫ+,k)], where θ(x) is the Heaveside step function, and D(E) = dN (E)/ΩdE

gives

if E < 0;

if E > 0.

(6)

Namely, due to the spin-orbit coupling, the low energy (E → −µλ2/2) density of states diverges
as in the one-dimensional case, while those for E > 0 retains the usual two-dimensional constant

density of states.

In the following, we assume that the repulsive interactions between the bosons can be modeled

by the contact psuedopotential

V (r1 − r2) = (U + Usσ1 · σ2)δ(r1 − r2),

(7)

where σ1,2 are the Pauli matrices of the two particles, and U and Us are positive interaction coupling

constants. U describes the spin-independent density-density interactions, while Us describes the

spin-dependent spin exchange interaction. Due to Bose statistics, the contact psuedopotential is

nonzero only when two bosons are in a spin triplet state; V (r) in Eq. (7) is equivalent to eU δ(r) with
eU = U + Us. We should emphasise here that Eq. (7) is not the most general interaction between

atoms and in fact, only approximate the real form of the interaction between 87Rb. However, we

expect that such a simpliﬁed choice of interaction would not aﬀect the nature of the correlated

ground states which we discuss later, as their nature is rooted in the degeneracy brought about by

the spin-orbit coupling.

III. MEAN FIELD CONDENSATE STATES

Before we discuss the possibility of correlated ground states, let us ﬁrst list a few candidate

condensate states built from the lowest single particle states |p| = µλ. For an ideal condensate of
N bosons, the trial wave-function can be written as

|Condi =

(φ†0)N
√N ! |0i,

value of the interaction energy is given by (zp = exp(iϕp))

IV. FEW-BODY TRIAL WAVE-FUNCTIONS

To demonstrate how the bosons can take advantage of the degeneracy of the lower Rashba branch

at |p| = µλ to lower their interaction energy than an ideal condensate, we construct explicit trial
wave-functions with correlations built in for two and four bosons.

A. Two-body

We write down the following two-body wave-function

ψ0 = X|p|=µλ

(10)

7

where Ap is the amplitude of the wave-function to be determined by minimizing the interaction
energy. Since we have constrained |p| = µλ, the kinetic energy is already at its minimum. It turns
out that by choosing appropriate Ap ∼ ei2nϕp, with n 6= 0, 1, one can show that ψ0(r1 = r2) = 0.
Due to the contact nature of the interaction potential, this means that Eq. (10) is an exact eigenstate

of two interacting bosons. The wave-function (10) is the same as the one found in Ref. [41].

Previously Refs. [34] and [48] have also shown that two-body scattering states in the lower Rashba

branch can have zero interaction energy once the bare interactions are properly renormalised.

The fact that there exists a great many choice of n such that exact two-body states without

interaction can be constructed raises the interesting possibility of many-body correlated states,

which, while still consists of states with |p| = µλ, avoids the interaction energy by correlating
bosons in the manner as embodied in the two-body wave-function, Eq. (10). Unfortunately, this

straightforward generalization from two-body to many-body could not be consistently carried out,

since Eq. (10) correlates two bosons on the opposite side of the degenerate circle, and for a many-

body system, it is impossible to achieve for any arbitrary pair. This diﬃculty can be most easily

seen in the four bosons case to be discussed below.

B. Four-body

If we try to build explicitly the two-body correlation in the four boson case, an trial wave-

function can be constructed

|Corri = X|p|,|k|=µλ

Apa†pa†

−pBka†ka†

−k|0i,

(11)

with Ap = Aei2nϕp and Bk = Bei2mϕk . It is clear that we are simply building into the four particle

wave-function the correlations that we have identiﬁed in the two-body case. If m = n, Eq. (11) can

be viewed as a condensate of boson pairs, which is the same as the one used in Ref. [56] to study
the condensation of paired bosons. The normalization is hCorr|Corri = [(1 + δmn)π2 + 2π]A2B2.
Direct evaluation yields

hCorr|Hint|Corri =

(1 + δmn)π2A2B2.

Thus the expectation value of the interaction energy for the correlated wave-function is

which is approximately 7.33 × eU /Ω for m 6= n and 9.1 × eU /Ω for m = n, compared with the

lowest interaction energy of an ideal condensate of Eq. (8) given in Tab. I, Case IV with N = 4,

(9−3/π)eU /Ω ≈ 8.04×eU /Ω. Thus for four bosons, Eq. (11) with m 6= n has lower interaction energy

than the ideal trial condensed states. A super-fragmented trial state was proposed in Ref. [41],

whose interaction energy, if evaluated with our assumed interaction potential for N = 4, would be
3.44 ˜U /Ω, even lower. This comparison indicates that diﬀerent ways to correlate the bosons can

suppress the interaction energy to diﬀerent degrees.

Despite the eﬀort to build in two-body correlation, the condensate states and the trial correlated

wave functions for four bosons have at least two common features. Firstly, they are all built from

the lowest energy states on the degenerate ring and secondly their energies are all proportional to

energy, it is expected that the system falls in the mean ﬁeld regime, as discussed above. However,

1/Ω and coupling constant eU . When eU = 0, all bosons will condense in the lowest single particle
state. As one increases eU from zero but still keeps it small compared to the single particle excitation
as eU increases further, the weakly dispersing lowest Rashba band becomes very important. One
the lower Rashba branch with momentum p − µλ . 1/√Ω diﬀer only by energy of order of 1/Ω

way to see this is that if one starts with a ﬁnite system with area Ω, the single particle states in

with the states in the degenerate ring. On the other hand, the apparent scale of the interaction

energy is also 1/Ω (cf. Eq. (13)). This indicates that, at least in the strong interaction regime, it

is important to consider the transverse excitations, and their eﬀects have to be taken into account

in the construction of eﬀective Hamiltonian (see Sec. V B). The above considerations prompt us

to study the bosons in a disk of ﬁnite size Ω in the next section, where we are able to treat both

the kinetic and interaction energies on the same footing.

V. SMALL CLUSTERS IN A DISK.

Correlated ground states for a homogeneous interacting Bose gas with the Rashba spin-orbit

coupling [40, 41] have been explored by means of fermionization [49] and by vortex attache-

ment [50]. Numerical calculations have also revealed the correlated nature of the system in a

harmonic trap [51].

To understand how strong spin-orbit coupling can help the bosons to suppress interaction energy,

we study a cluster of bosons with the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a two-dimensional disk of

radius R with a hard wall boundary condition, while earlier works has focused on two-dimensional

harmonic trap conﬁnement [40, 52–55]. In this case, the single particle eigen-wave-functions with

eigenenergies Enm have the generic form

Φnm(r, ϕ) =

fnm(r)eimϕ

ξnm+1(r)ei(m+1)ϕ ,

9

(14)

where m + 1/2 is the eigenvalue of Sz + Lz, and n is the radial quantum number determined when

Φnm(R, ϕ) = 0 is imposed on the wave-function in the radial direction. The detailed expressions

of fnm(r) and ξnm+1(r) in terms of Bessel functions are given in Appendix A. In the following, we

use x ≡p2µ2λ2R2 to quantify the spin-orbit coupling strength.

is for m = 5, dashed line is for m = 10 and dotted line is for m = 15.

Figure 2 shows the energy spectrum Enm and the associated ground state wave-functions f0m(r)

and ξ0m+1(r) (n = 0) for both small (a-c) and large (d-f) spin-orbit coupling strengths x. We

take 1/2µR2 as energy units throughout.

In Figure 2 (a), the energy spectrum for small spin-

orbit coupling (x = 0.1) is strongly dispersive. The small spin-orbit coupling can be regarded

as a perturbation to the usual quadratic kinetic energy. However, when the spin-orbit coupling

10

strength is large enough such as x = 100 as shown in Figure 2 (d), the energy spectrum segregates

into distinct energy bands and the lower energy bands corresponding to smaller n are more ﬂat.

For x = 100, the band bottom of the lowest energy band is found numerically to be at energy
about 2.47× 1/2µR2 − µλ2/2. As an example, the energies for n = 0 are essentially non-dispersive
In this limit, the quadratic kinetic energy can be viewed as
for the states with m ∈ [−40, 40].
a perturbation to the spin-orbit coupling. Figure 2 (b) and (c) show the wave functions f0m(r)

and ξ0m+1(r) versus r for the lowest energy band n = 0. For a larger spin-orbit coupling strength

(x = 100), the wave-functions exhibit increased oscillations compared those with a small spin-orbit

coupling strength. With increasing |m|, the weight of the wave-functions moves towards r = R.
Here we would like to contrast the behavior of f0m(r) and ξ0m+1(r) with that in the quantum

Hall problem, where the lowest Landau level wave-functions in the symmetric gauge are localized
within distance ℓ at a set of concentric ring with radius √2mℓ, where ℓ is the magnetic length.
In contrast, the wave-functions f0m(r) and ξ0m+1(r) are more spread out and with considerable

oscillations for large spin-orbit coupling.

When the spin-orbit coupling strength x is large [Fig. 2 (d)], the n = 0 energy band is nearly ﬂat

and does not overlap with the higher bands for a large range of m [cf. Figure 2(d)], we can project

the Hilbert space into the lowest band n = 0. As a result, we shall omit the radial quantum

index n. The low energy physics can be described by the Hamiltonian H = Hkin + Hint with
Hkin = Ema†mam, where a†m is the creation operator for states with wave-function Φ0m(r). The

interaction Hamiltonian is given by

Hint = Xm1,m2,m3,m4

V (m1, m2, m3, m4)a†m1 a†m2am3am4 δm1+m2−m3−m4,

(15)

where the matrix elements V (m1, m2, m3, m4) are given by

V (m1, m2, m3, m4) = πeUZ R

drr[f∗m1(r)fm4(r) + ξ∗m1+1(r)ξm4+1(r)][f∗m2 (r)fm3(r) + ξ∗m2+1(r)ξm3+1(r)].

(16)

It is worth to mention that the lowest band approximation we take here breaks down whenever the

average energy of a boson (while the interaction energy may be small, the kinetic energy and thus

the total energy can be still quite large) is comparable to the band gap such that higher bands are

substantially populated.

A. Exact Diagonalization

We use the above Hamiltonian H = Hkin + Hint projected to the lowest band to solve the states

of N bosons in the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling limit by exact diagonalization. In the lowest

band, we truncate the single particle states up to the azimuthal angular momentum |m| = L by
which numerical convergence can be reached. Being speciﬁc, we calculate for N = 2, 3, 4 with

x = 100, eU = 4/µ and L = 40.

There are two degenerate ground states at M = 10 and −12 for N = 2 (Figure 3(a)), at M = −1

of Lz + Sz = m + 1/2 is a single particle eigenfunction with energy Em of Eq. (1), so is ei π
2 σy Φ∗m(r).
By using Jm(x) = (−1)mJ−m(x), we ﬁnd that ei π
2 σy Φ∗m(r) has Lz + Sz = −m − 3/2; both the
single particle states of angular momentum symmetric about Lz + Sz = −1/2 are degenerate.
The interaction Hamiltonian is time-reversal invariant with the time-reversal operator deﬁned as
T = e−i π
2 σyK with the complex conjugation operator K. Thus in the case of a cluster of N bosons,
the energy spectrum should be symmetric with respect to M = −N/2, which agrees with Figure 3.
Figure 3 also shows that there is a large range of M for which the low lying EM is rather ﬂat.

In the ﬂat region, the energy per particle for the relevant eU we consider is about from 0.1× 1/2µR2
to 0.3 × 1/2µR2, measured with respect to the band bottom of the lower Rashba band. This is
much smaller than the energy diﬀerence between the lowest two bands n = 0 and 1 at m = 0,

13

approximately 10/2µR2, and justiﬁes our lowest band approximation. Whenever the energy per
particle (with respect the lowest band bottom whose value is 2.47 × 1/2µR2 − µλ2/2) becomes
comparable to 10/2µR2, our lowest band approximation breaks down.

On the other hand, Figure 3 shows that the interaction energy per particle of the ground

state |s0i is orders of magnitude smaller than its energy per particle. This magnitude diﬀerence
suggests that the bosons are taking advantage of the nearly ﬂat lowest band to correlate in a

way such that the interaction energy, usually of order ln(µλR)/2µR2 (see Eq. (18) below), which

for x = 100 is about 4.3 × 1/2µR2, is greatly suppressed. Figure 4 (a-b) show that when eU

increases, bosons are prompted to the single particle states of larger |m| in the lowest band, thus
increasing the kinetic energy. Correspondingly, Fig. 4 (c-d) shows that the density distribution

is pushed away from the center due to occupation of higher angular momentum states m. Here

Nm is the occupancy of single particle state with angular momentum m. With the spreading

of Nm, it is possible for bosons to explore a larger set of nearly-degenerate lowest band single

particle states to suppress interactions. This diﬀerence also indicates that the kinetic energy of
the cluster, which arises from the weakly dispersing band (whose width is about 0.6 × 1/(2µR2)
for L = 40 and x = 100), comprises the majority of the energy of the system. For example, the

dispersion of the single particle lowest band for x = 100 (cf. Fig. 2(d)) can be well ﬁtted by the
formula (Em + µλ2/2)/(1/2µR2) = 5.11× 10−4(m + 1/2)2 + 2.47. Given that the boson occupation
number Nm is noticeable up to m = 20 (see Fig. 4(a) and (b)), the kinetic energy of each boson
is estimated to be about 0.2 × 1/2µR2 when measured from the band bottom, agreeing with our
numerical calculations. Thus it is necessary to start with an eﬀective Hamiltonian for which the

transverse excitations away from the degenerate ring are included.

The correlation of the ground state |s0i is manifested in the density-density function

g2(0, r) = h: n(r)n(0) :i
hn(r)i hn(0)i

,

(17)

where n(r) is the density operator of the bosons, the symbol : : means normal ordering and

h. . . i is averaging with respect to |s0i. Since |s0i is an eigenstate of total Lz + Sz, g2(0, r) is
a function of r. Figure 5 indicates that the probability for two bosons to stay close to each

other is greatly suppressed at large interaction eU , and as eU increases, such suppression becomes

stood from the following semi-classical picture. From Fig. 4 (a) for N = 3, the most probable

relative angular momentum between two bosons is about ∆m = 40. Due to the strong spin-

orbit coupling, the typical linear momentum of a boson is about µλ and the typical relative

FIG. 5. (Color online) Correlation function g2(0, r) of the ground state versus r/R for diﬀerent eU . The

probability for two bosons to stay close to each other is suppressed and the suppression is larger as the

increase of the interaction strength. Here, we show the case of N = 3. The asymptotic value is about
2/3 ∼ 0.67, diﬀering from 1 because of the ﬁnite number (N = 3) of particles considered.

linear momentum between two bosons is about 2µλ. Thus the most probable distance ∆r be-

tween two bosons is about ∆r/R = ∆m/2µλR = ∆m/√2x ≈ 0.28. Beyond the maximum,

g2(0, r) converges to a constant. The constant is noticeably smaller than unity due to the bo-

son number N being comparable to unity. Note that the numerator of g2(0, r) normalises as

R d2rh: n(r)n(0) :i = (N − 1)hn(0)i, which we have checked numerically, while the denominator of
g2(0, r) normalises as R d2rhn(r)i hn(0)i = Nhn(0)i. This means that for N = 3, the asymptotic

value of g2(0, r) is about 2/3 ∼ 0.67, consistent with numerical ﬁndings.

The underlying correlation between the bosons also gives rise to an intriguing behavior of the

interaction energy V0 of the ground state |s0i with respect to the interaction strength eU . Figure

use 1/2µR2 as energy units and 1/µ as units for eU .

(c). What is surprising is that, however, Figure 6 (b) shows that the interaction energy V0 is a

state |s0i for N = 3 with eU both in the strongly and weakly correlated regimes. By the Hellmann-
Feynman theorem, E0 must be a strictly increasing function of eU , agreeing with Figure 6 (a) and
decreasing function of eU in the range µeU ∈ [0.5, 0.9], contrary to what one would expect for an
eU -dependence of the constructed wave-function |Corri (Eq. (11)) and the super-fragmented state

ideal condensed state (cf. Tab. I), including mean ﬁeld vortex states. It is also opposite to the

proposed in Ref. [41]. In the weakly correlated limit where the interaction energy is much smaller

16

than the energy diﬀerence between neighbouring states which is found to be of order 10−3 for

x = 100, Figure 6 (d) shows that interaction energy V0 increases linearly with eU . So does E0 in
Fig. 6 (c). Thus as eU increases, the ground state shall evolve from a weakly interacting regime

where the usual mean ﬁeld treatment is applicable to a strongly correlated regime where crucial

interaction eﬀects can not be captured by mean ﬁeld.

B. Eﬀective low-energy Hamiltonian

To understand why in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling it is favorable for a cluster of

bosons to correlate in a way to suppress the interaction energy, we extract the leading order of

the interaction Hamiltonian Eq. (15). In the limit x → ∞, we can simplify the matrix elements
V (m1, m2, m3, m4), and as shown in Appendix B, the ﬁnal form of the interaction Hamiltonian

takes a particularly simple form, to leading order in ln(µλR),

H′int =

πR2 ln(µλR)Xl
4eU

(A†l Al + B†l Bl),

(18)

where Al = Pm eNl−meNmamal−m and Bl = Pm(−1)meN2l−meNmama2l−m. The dimensionless
normalization factor eNm is given in Appendix B. It is worth to emphasise that Eq. (18) is derived
within the lowest band approximation, which as we argue above holds for our numerical calculation
with x = 100, cutoﬀ L = 40 and up to N = 4. Obviously, for any states |ψi, hψ| H′int |ψi ≥ 0.
The strength of H′int is logarithmically divergent in the large spin-orbit coupling limit. If we now
neglect the weak dispersion of the lowest band which is of order of 1/(λ2R4) as compared with
ln(µλR)/R2, the ground state will be the one which minimises H′int. For a state |si, hs| H′int |si = 0
only if Al |si = Bl |si = 0 for any l. The existence of such nontrivial correlated states can be
considered in the following way. We assume that the spin-orbit coupling is so large that the lowest

band can be considered ﬂat for the states of m ∈ [−L, L]. For N bosons, the dimension of the
Hilbert space is (2L + N )!/(2L)!N !. The requirement that Al |si = Bl |si = 0 for l ∈ [2L,−2L]
imposes 2(4L + 1)(2L + N − 2)!/(2L)!(N − 2)! constraints. For ﬁxed N , the constraints can be
simultaneously satisﬁed if L is large enough; in other words, when the spin-orbit coupling is large

enough. On the other hand, an ideal condensate of the form Eq. (8) can not avoid the interaction

of the form H′int since a condensate wave-function is determined by assigning 2L + 1 superposition
coeﬃcients. Thus in this limit, the ground state |s0i of a cluster of bosons is expected to have

the correlation such that hs0|Pl(A†l Al + B†l Bl)|s0i ≪ 1, which is compatible as shown in Fig. 6

(b) where the interaction energy V0 is much smaller than 1/2µR2. It is worth mentioning that

17

H′int is formally similar to a Hamiltonian whose ground state can be correlated Mott insulators,

corresponding to fractional quantum hall states [46, 47]. The nonlocal nature of eNm (see Appendix

B), however, precludes constructing exact ground states of H′int in our case. It is important to note
the diﬀerence between Eq. (18) and other eﬀective interactions derived in Refs. [34] and [41] for

inﬁnite systems; the renormalised eﬀective interaction derived in Ref. [34] is applicable to the lower

branch states while the one in Ref. [41] is meant for states on the degenerate ring. In all, the above

considerations based on Eq. (18) made it clear why other than an ideal condensed state, the bosons

would prefer to be in a ground state with strong correlations, whose properties we have revealed

in details by the previous numerical calculation.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this work, we describe how the enhanced low-energy density of states changes the properties

of a spin-half boson subjected to the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We carry out an exact diagonal-

isation calculation for a cluster of bosons with strong spin-orbit coupling and reveal the correlated

nature of its ground state. We derive the corresponding eﬀective Hamiltonian [Eq.(18)], which is

particular simple in form and suggests a correlated ground state that is analogous to correlated

Mott insulator and quantum Hall states, suggested earlier in the literature.

However, standing alone, the argument based on the eﬀective Hamiltonian (18) is deﬁcient at

least in two aspects. Firstly, the weak dispersion of the lowest band and sub-leading terms of

the interaction Hamiltonian need to be considered in order to uniquely determine the true ground

state. Secondly, the comparison with ideal condensed states is less relevant if bosons can lower

their energy substantially by strong depleting from condensates. The later problem requires one to

investigate possible variational ground states of a condensed boson system with strong depletion,

which we do not attempt here; see however, the relevant discussion of Ref. [57]. More extensive

numerical calculations (e.g., variational Monte Carlo) are necessary to provide more evidences to

the correlated nature of the ground state.

At the moment, there is no requirement on the overall normalization. Note that α(±)

that it vanishes at r = R. This can be done by forming a superposition of χ±m(r, ϕ) (both of energy

them to have non-zero solution is that the corresponding determinant is zero. Namely, we require

and set the mass of the particle µ = 1.

To determine the normalization factor Nm and likewise in the following evaluation for the

interaction matrix elements, we expand

fm(r) = −[Jm(k+R)Jm(k−r) − Jm(k−R)Jm(k+r)],

ξm+1(r) = Jm(k+R)Jm+1(k−r) − Jm(k−R)Jm+1(k+r),

fm(r) = −2√∆[J′m(λR)Jm(λr)R − Jm(λR)J′m(λr)r],
ξm(r) = 2√∆[J′m(λR)Jm+1(λr)R − Jm(λR)J′m+1(λr)r].
