Weyl fermions have recently been observed in several time-reversal invariant semimetals and
photonics materials with broken inversion symmetry. These systems are expected to have ex-
otic transport properties such as the chiral anomaly. However, most discovered Weyl materials
posses a substantial number of Weyl nodes close to the Fermi level that aﬀect the electronic struc-
ture and transport properties. Here we predict for the ﬁrst time a new family of Weyl systems
deﬁned by broken time reversal symmetry, namely, Co-based magnetic Heusler materials XCo2Z
(X=V,Zr,Nb,Ti,Hf, Z=Si,Ge,Sn), VCo2Al and VCo2Ga. These compounds are ferromagnetic: us-
ing ﬁrst principle ab-initio calculations we ﬁnd that the energetically most favorable magnetic axis
is [110], consistent with our experimental measurements of the synthesized materials. This has a
fundamental eﬀect on the electronic structure of the bands around the Fermi level: a symmetry
eigenvalue analysis results in the prediction of low number of Weyl nodes along the magnetic axis,
related by inversion symmetry. When alloyed, these materials exhibit only two Weyl nodes at the
Fermi level - the minimum number possible in a condensed matter system. The Weyl nodes are
separated by a large distance (of order 2π) in the Brillouin zone, giving rise to well-deﬁned Fermi
arcs that is also calculated. This discovery provides a way to the realizing the hydrogen atom of
Weyl materials and opens the gate for potential transport applications.

Weyl fermions are theorized to exist in the standard
model above the symmetry breaking scale - at low-energy
scales they invariably acquire mass. As such, the search
for Weyl fermions has shifted to condensed matter sys-
tems, where they appear as unremovable crossings in
electronic Bloch bands, close to the Fermi level, in 3-
spatial dimensions. They recently became a reality with
the experimental discovery [1, 2] of the theoretically pre-
dicted [3, 4] Weyl semimetals (WSM) in the TaAs family
of compounds. Topological Weyl metals are responsible
for an array of exotic transport and spectroscopic phe-
nomena such as the chiral anomaly, unusual magnetore-
sistance and surface disconnected Fermi arcs[5–11].

Due to the Fermion doubling problem, Weyl nodes ap-
pear in multiples of 2. With time-reversal invariance,
this number raises to multiples of 4. The TaAs family of
compounds exhibits 24 Weyl nodes, due to several other
mirror symmetries. This large number of Weyls gives
rise to complicated transport and spectroscopic proper-
ties. By comparison, the hypothetical hydrogen atom of
Weyl semimetals is a material with only 2 Weyl nodes at
the Fermi level, preferably cleanly separated in momen-
tum space and in energy from other bands.

In this paper we predict a series of magnetic Heusler
compounds that exhibit, when alloyed, two Weyl points
close to Fermi energy and largely separated in momen-
tum space. We perform a ﬁrst principle determination of

the magnetization in these ferromagnetic materials, and
show that it is oriented in the [110] direction, consistent
with our magnetization measurements. Two Weyl nodes,
related by symmetry, appear on the same axis. Their en-
ergy relative to the Fermi level can be tuned by alloying,
and we provide an estimate of the appropriate concen-
tration of alloy necessary to tune the Weyls to the Fermi
level. We carry out a symmetry analysis and solidify our
ab-initio claims of the existence of Weyl nodes by showing
that they are formed by bands of opposite C2 eigenvalues.
Furthermore we link the existence of Weyl nodes to the
existence of an inversion invariant discovered earlier[12]
in the theory of inversion symmetric topological insula-
tors. We then obtain the structure of the Fermi arcs on
several surfaces. We expand upon the results in the Sup-
plementary Section, where we also analyze the possible
topological scenarios under diﬀerent potential magneti-
zation directions, and present magnetization data on one
of the synthesized materials from our list.

Our proposed candidates

for Weyl metals are
the following compounds: XCo2Z (X=V,Zr,Ti,Nb,Hf,
Z=Si,Ge,Sn), VCo2Al and VCo2Ga. This family of
Co2-based Heusler compounds follows the Slater-Pauling
rule which predicts a total spin magnetic moment m =
Nv−24 with Nv denoting the number of valence electrons
(s, d electrons for the transition metals and s, p electrons
for the main group element) and 24 the number of atoms
× 6 [13–15]. These materials exhibit half-metallic mag-
netism with a magnetic moment of 2 µB per formula unit.
In this paper we focus on a representative candidate -
ZrCo2Sn that we have also synthesized experimentally.

We present the results for the rest of the compounds
in the Supplementary Material. The Weyls of all un-
alloyed compounds are between 0.1-0.6 eV above/below
the Fermi energy. However alloying can be used to move
the Weyls nodes close to or at the Fermi level.

The family of Heusler compounds considered in this
paper have face-centered cubic (FCC) symmetry with
space group Fm-3m, (cid:93)225 (alternatively, O5
h). This space
group includes both fourfold rotational axes and inver-
sion symmetry. The lattice parameter is a = 6.27 ˚A for
the representative compound ZrCo2Sn. The structure,
depicted in Fig.1(a), can be represented as four inter-
penetrating face-centered sublattices, two of which are
equally occupied by Co; these form a simple cubic sub-
structure in the middle of the unit cell. The Zr and Sn
atoms then form a larger rocksalt-type substructure ﬁll-
ing out the full unit cell of the material. As a result, there
exist eight time-reversal invariant momenta formed by
the following high symmetry points (Γ(0,0,0), L(π,π,π),
X(2π,0,0)) in the Brillouin zone (BZ) (see Fig.1(b)).

In the absence of SOC, the spin-polarized band struc-
ture and density of states (DOS) of ZrCo2Sn are calcu-
lated within GGA+U, shown in Fig.1(c) and Fig. 1(d)
respectively. The value of U was chosen to be 3 eV,
which provides Curie temperature close to the experi-
mental value. We see a band gap in the minority states
around EF , suggesting a good half-metallic property,
which is consistent with the experimental investigation
of the spin-resolved unoccupied density of states of the
partner compound TiCo2Sn [16]. Due to the minority
gap, the magnetic moment is an integer and has a value
of exactly 2 µB per formula unit at T = 0 K, fulﬁlling
the Slater-Pauling rule. The majority states of ZrCo2Sn
just around EF are mostly of d character, namely Co-
d and Zr-d states. Because the SOC strengths of both
Co and Zr are small, and the states around EF are fully
spin-polarized, the SOC has only a weak inﬂuence on
the half-metallic ferromagnetism in these Heusler com-
pounds. We performed ab inito calculation to determine
the energetically most favorable magnetization direction -

is energetically very close to the [100]. To conﬁrm our
predictions several samples were grown and performed
experimental measurements at 10 K, and the results are
consistent with the [110] direction (see Supplementary
Material), which we will assume from now on. A theo-
retical analysis of the [100] magnetism also shows topo-
logical properties such as line nodes in the band structure
(see Supplementary Material).

The spin-resolved bulk band structure with SOC in-
cluded is shown in Fig.1(e)-(f) with[110] easy axis. We
calculated the spin projection onto the [110] axis and ﬁnd
that the main contribution comes from Sz, similar to a
pure Ising system. Thus, although the SOC interaction is
crucial to the magnetic symmetries and the correspond-
ing Weyl physics, the inclusion of SOC does not change
much the structure of the bands around the Fermi level.
We estimate the SOC energy scale to be ∼0.01 eV.

In the absence of SOC, the spin and the orbitals are
independent and regarded as diﬀerent subspaces. In this
case the spatial crystal symmetries of O5
h have no eﬀect
on the spin degree of freedom, and the two spin channels
are decoupled. Once SOC is considered, the two spin
channels couple together, and symmetries can decrease
dramatically depending on the direction of the sponta-
neous magnetization. For instance, neglecting SOC, the
mirror reﬂection Mz is a symmetry. Including SOC, Mz
is broken when the magnetizations is along [110]. At the
same time, the product between time-reversal and reﬂec-
tion symmetries (T Mz) is a magnetic symmetry for [110]
magnetization, and this remains so once SOC is included.
The corresponding magnetic space group of [110] spin-
polarization contains only 8 elements with three genera-
tors: inversion I, 2-fold rotation C2110 around 110 axis
and the product (T C2z) of time-reversal and rotation
C2z, which allows for the existence of Weyl points (WP)
in the xy-plane [17].

We ﬁrst elucidate the band topology in the absence of
SOC. The band structure is shown in Fig.1(c). We can
observe that two bands crossings occur along ΓX, ΓW
and ΓK. These crossings are in the xy-plane, which has
mirror Mz as a little group in the absence of SOC. Bands
within this plane can be classiﬁed by mirror eigenvalues
±1. Further symmetry analysis shows that the two bands
crossing display opposite mirror eigenvalues hence form-
ing a nodal line in the xy plane[18–23]. The energy of
the nodal line disperses dramatically in the xy plane ,
as shown in Fig. 2(b). The minimum of this dispersion
is in the ΓX (or [100]) direction and the maximum is in
the ΓK (or [110]) direction. In addition to the nodal line
in the xy-plane, two similar nodal lines are also found
in the xz-plane and yz-plane related by a C4 rotation
around the x, y coordinate axis. As a result, the three
nodal lines in diﬀerent planes intersect at six diﬀerent
points as depicted in Fig. 2(a).

Upon introducing SOC, with a magnetization along
the [110] direction, the mirror symmetries Mz, Mx and
My are all broken. In the absence of other symmetries,

(b) Nodal line in the xy plane

with SOC. The independent W, W1 and W2 points are clearly
indicated in the ﬁgure - the remaining ones can be obtained
by symmetry. The Chern numbers are also indicated (the

project onto the same point of our xy plane.

these nodal lines in the mirror planes would become fully
gapped. However, along the magnetization [110] direc-
tion, a pair of Weyl points survive protected by the C2110
rotation. Namely, the bands with SOC can be labeled by
C2110 eigenvalues in the [110] direction and the crossing
bands belong to the two diﬀerent rotational eigenvalues
±i. The coordinates of these WPs (W ), related by in-
version I, are given in Tab. I. Their location and Chern
numbers are illustrated in Fig.2(c). An inversion eigen-
value argument shows us that we must have 4k+2, k ∈ Z,
number of Weyls in this system (see Supplementary Ma-
terial): the product of the inversion eigenvalues of the
occupied bands at the inversion symmetric points is −1,
signaling the presence of an odd number of pairs of Weyls
[12]. These Weyl points, which in the un-alloyed system
are at 0.6 eV above the Fermi level, can be brought to
the Fermi level by a proper concentration of alloying.

The nodal lines break up into other Weyl nodes un-
der SOC. Other four Weyls are found slightly away from
the coordinate axis in the xy-plane. The presence of
Weyls in a high symmetry plane is allowed by the an-
tiunitary symmetry T C2z [17]. The quadruplet Weyls
(W1) are related to each other by I and C2110. Their
precise positions and topological charges are presented
in Tab. I. In order to ﬁnd all the Weyl points originated
from the nodal lines, we calculate the Chern number of
the (1¯10)-plane (spanned by [1¯10] and the z-axis). With
the Wilson-loop method with kz-loops, the evolution of
the Wannier charge centers reveals the topological Chern

metry lines without (w/o) SOC (left) and with SOC (right).
The color map indicates orbital localization of valence elec-

number, which turns out to be +3 in the (1¯10)-plane.
The ﬂux from the two W Weyls and four W1 Weyls
provide a Chern number −1 on the (1¯10)-plane, leav-
ing a Chern-number deﬁciency of 4, corresponding to the
Berry ﬂux of yet another 8-Weyls. Guided by this, we
see that a third kind of Weyl points (W2), diﬀerent from
the previous two kinds, arise from the nodal lines upon
the introduction of the SOC. In contrast to the previous
two kinds, these Weyl points do not prefer any special
direction, but distribute near the xz- and yz-plane. As
these Weyls are generic points without any little-group
symmetry, the octuplet Weyls W2 are related by all the
three generators of the magnetism group. As a result, the
position of the W2 changes considerably from TiCo2Sn,
to ZrCo2Sn to HfCo2Sn, following the nodal lines with-
out SOC. In principle, this kind of Weyls are not stable
(in contrast, the W-Weyls are protected by the inversion
symmetry conﬁguration), as they can be moved close in
the z-axis and thereby annihilate with each other. All
the Chern numbers of the three Weyls are shown in Ta-
ble I, and their Projections are shown in Fig.2(c). As the
energy level of W1 is very low and W2 could be removed
by tuning SOC, we will focus on the doublet Weyls W .

the xy plane, while the W2 are stable out of the plane. The
coordinates of the other Weyl points are related to the ones
listed by the symmetries, I, C2110 and T C2z.

area shows the two W Weyl points along K − Γ − (−K) line.

Calculated Bloch spectral

now is to tune the energy of the WP to the Fermi level.
For this purpose we consider other compounds with the
same stoichiometry, more electrons and similar lattice
parameter. In this direction we found NbCo2Sn, which
has the same crystal structure and its lattice parameter
is a = 6.146 ˚A. Moreover from ab-initio calculations (see
Fig.3 where the bulk band structure is depicted), we ﬁnd
1 Weyl point (W ) in the K − Γ direction below the Fermi
level around -0.8 eV and observe again that the inclusion
of SOC interaction does not change the structure of the
bands close to the Fermi level. Therefore, one can ex-
pect that alloying ZrCo2Sn with Nb in the Zr site would
shift down the WP energy while keeping the main band
topology unchanged.

Using a ﬁrst-principles Green’s function method, we
dope ZrCo2Sn with Nb. Disorder eﬀects were taken
into account within a coherent potential approxima-
tion (CPA). Varying Nb content , we search for a con-
centration, which brings the W Weyls to the Fermi
level. Fig.4 shows the calculated spectral function for
Zr1−xNbxCo2Sn (with x =0.275). By inversion I sym-
metry, there exist another Weyl point separated in k-
space by ∼2π with the same energy (see insert in Fig.4).
In the same line we have doped the partner compound
TiCo2Sn with V, and found x=0.1 (see Supplementary
Material).

Given that the Weyl nodes W , W1 and W2 all resulted
from the connected nodal lines in the absence of SOC,
a large residual Fermi surface has a projection on any
surface of the material. Hence the Fermi arcs emanating
from the W Weyl points are interrupted by the residual
projection of bulk Fermi surfaces on the surface of the
material. However, the Fermi arc signatures are still clear
as can be seen in Fig.5 where we plot the surface spectral
function for the (001)-surface of ZrCo2Sn. Since the bulk
Fermi surface projections where W1 and W2 are located,

new family of Co-based magnetic Heuslers realize Weyl
systems with several Weyl nodes whose position in en-
ergy can be tuned by alloying. We have performed ab
initio calculations of a representative ferromagnetic com-
pound ZrCo2Sn to determine the spontaneous magneti-
zation and found that the easy axis is in the [110] di-
rection, consistent with our experimental measurements
(see Supplemental Material). For the [110] magnetization
we ﬁnd two Weyl points related by I symmetry situated
on the [110] axis. By means of a ﬁrst-principles Green’s
function method, we doped the ZrCo2Sn with Nb and
showed that these two Weyls can be shifted to the Fermi
level. Finally, we obtained the Fermi arc structure of this
class of materials.

TABLE II. Lattice parameters and references of the Co-based
family compounds

In order to tune the Weyls energy of TiCo2Sn to the
Fermi level, we doped it with the following concentration
of V: Ti0.9 V0.1Co2Sn (see Fig.7)

Appendix B: Calculation Methods

The ﬁrst-principles calculations have been performed
within the DFT as implemented in the Vienna Ab-initio
Simulation Package (VASP) [29, 30]. The interaction be-
tween ion cores and valence electrons was treated by the
projector augmented wave method [31]. The orbitals
considered as valence electrons in the atomic pseudo-
potential for the representative compound ZrCo2Sn were:
Zr (4s24p65s24d2), Co (3d84s1) and Sn (5s25p2). To de-
scribe the exchange-correlation energy, we used the Gen-
eral Gradient Approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-
Burke-Ernkzerhof (PBE) parameterization [32]. In order
to account for the magnetic character of the system we
performed spin polarized calculations, with the full crys-
tal symmetry implemented per spin species. The Hamil-
tonian contains the scalar relativistic corrections and the
spin-orbit coupling is taken into account by the second
variation method [33]. Since the d-electrons of Cobalt
are strongly correlated we introduce on-site Coulomb re-
pulsion [34] of U = 3 eV, a value chosen to reproduce the
TC temperature of the system [35]. We use the exper-
imental lattice parameters and atomic positions in the
unit cell. A k -point grid of (20×20×20) for reciprocal
space integration and 400 eV energy cut-oﬀ of the plane
wave expansion have been used to get a residual error
on atomic forces below 1 meV/˚A and a fully converged
electronic structure including spin-orbit coupling (SOC).
The electronic structure calculations of alloys were per-
formed using a self-consistent full-charge-density Green’s

function method [36–38] in a scalar relativistic scheme.
We used 24 Gaussian quadrature points to carry out
a complex energy contour integration, while for the
integration over the Brillouin zone we used a mesh
of (20×20×20) k points. Substitutional disorder was
treated within the coherent potential approach (CPA)
[39].

Appendix C: Experimental realization

ZrCo2Sn single crystals of mm size were grown by the
Sn-self ﬂux method. The Zr, Co and Sn elements were
placed in a 5:10:90 atomic ratio in an alumina crucible
and then sealed under vacuum in a quartz glass tube.
The ampoule was heated to 1130 ◦C, where it was held
for 4 hours, and then cooled at 2 ◦C/hr.
to 960 C,
when it was centrifuged to extract the crystals from ﬂux.
The crystals grew with well-developed cube truncated
octahedron morphologies, as shown in Figure 8. The
Heusler phase for the crystals was determined by record-
ing powder X-ray diﬀraction patterns (Cu kα radiation)
on crushed and ground crystals and single crystals. The
top panel in Figure 9 shows an X-ray diﬀraction pattern
recorded on a powdered sample, in which the match to
the reported Heusler phase pattern given in the ICSD is
shown (the green lines at the bottom of the pattern).
In the bottom panel is shown the diﬀraction pattern
recorded for a (111) crystal face; this pattern consists
of reﬂections corresponding to only the n·(111) planes.
This shows that the grown crystals are of high quality.
The temperature and ﬁeld dependent magnetizations for
several single crystals were measured in a Quantum De-
sign MPMS system. Representative data are shown in
Figures 10 and 11.

Appendix D: Inversion Symmetry Characterization

With broken time-reversal, when inversion symmetry
is present, a simple diagnostic can be applied to ﬁnd out
if an odd number of pairs of Weyl nodes (2(2n + 1) Weyl
Fermions) are present in a material [12]. Take the prod-
uct of the inversion eigenvalue ζn(Ki) of all bands n below
the Fermi level, over all bands n at all inversion symmet-

ric points Ki:(cid:89)

(cid:89)

ζn(Ki)

(D1)

Ki=−Ki

n bands with En(Ki)<Ef

If this number = −1 then an ODD number of pairs of
Weyls exists in the bulk, which means that Weyl nodes
must exist.
If this number is 1 then it is not possi-
ble (with inversion symmetry only) to easily deduce if
a nonzero number of pairs or a zero number of pairs is
present in the system. For our system, we ﬁnd the inver-
sion eigenvalues in Table III with product -1, and hence
an odd number of Weyl pairs needs to be present in our
system

Appendix E: C4 Eigenvalues characterization with

hypothetical [001] magnetization

If the magnetization would (hypothetically) be paral-
lel to [001] another eigenvalue-based formula gives more
information about the number of Weyls in the system. It
involves the C4z eigenvalues of the bands. Let Γ = 0, 0,
M = π, π, X = π, 0 be points on a 2-D lattice. Form the

product (cid:89)

θn(Γ, 0)θn(M, 0)ξn(X, 0) ×

n bands<Ef

θn(Γ, π)θn(M, π)ξn(X, π)

(E1)

where the product is only over the bands resting below
the Fermi level at the speciﬁed momenta (assuming the
same number of bands rest below the Fermi level at any of
the Γ, M, X momenta). In the above θ is the eigenvalue
of C4 while ξ is the eigenvalue of C2 at the respective
momentum of the respective band. If this product is dif-
ferent from −1, 1 (notice that it can be imaginary due to
the C4 eigenvalues) then Weyl nodes exist in the system.
In our model, with [001] magnetization, line nodes are
present due to additional Mirror symmetries, and these
pre-empt the use of this formula. We only mention it
here for completeness. Fig 12 shows the nodal lines along
some high symmetry lines.

Appendix F: Symmetries of 2-band Hamiltonian

with M||[110]

We derive the little-group and the symmetries for po-
tential Weyl nodes when the ferromagnetic magnetiza-
tion if parallel to the [110] direction.
In this case, the
following symmetry group remains: P ; C2110; C2z · T ;
C21¯10 · T . We now analyze the little group on diﬀerent
high-symmetry planes and axes to ﬁnd out if Weyls can
appear generically on those planes.

[110] axis

xy plane

The little group is C2110, and bands with diﬀerent
eigenevalues under this symmetry can cross. Away from
this axis, the crossing splits and Weyl nodes can exist on
this axis.

2. Little group of the k-space Hamiltonian on the

100 (or equivalent) axis

The only element of the symmetry group that maps
kx, 0, 0 to itself is C2z · T with matrix representation
C2z·T = iσxK with K complex conjugation. The Hamil-
tonian on this axis is H(kx, 0, 0) = di(kx, 0, 0)σi with the
constraint:

[H(kx, 0, 0), iσxK] = 0

(F1)

which gives:

Hence

dz(kx, 0, 0) = 0

(F2)

The little group of the kz = 0, π planes is C2z · T , just
as in the previous subsection. Going through an identical
calculation, now the Hamiltonian is

H(kx, ky, 0) = dx(kx, ky, 0)σx + dy(kx, ky, 0)σy

(F4)

The Hamiltonian contains two parameters, two mo-
menta, and Weyl nodes can generically live on this high
symmetry plane.

4. Little group of the k-space Hamiltonian on the

[[1¯10], [001] plane

The little group is C2110 · P . This is essentially the
mirror group with mirror plane [[1¯10], [001]], which is a
little group for momenta in that plane. From

[H(kx, ky, kz ∈ plane

1¯10, 001), C2110 · P ] = 0

(F5)

we ﬁnd dz = 0, dx = dy in this plane. Hence in this
plane i have only one independent coeﬃcient dx but 2
momenta, so this plane can support nodal lines.

H(kx, 0, 0) = dx(kx, 0, 0)σx + dy(kx, 0, 0)σy

(F3)

Appendix G: Additional Remarks

The Hamiltonian contains two parameters, one momen-
tum, (kx) giving rise generically to avoided crossings. No
Weyls are possible this line generically.

Vesta[40], gnuplot[41], pyProcar[42] and Mayavi[43]
software packages were used to create some of the illus-
trations.
