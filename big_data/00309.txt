ABSTRACT

Context. Runaway O- and early B-type stars passing throughout the interstellar medium at supersonic velocities and characterized
by strong stellar winds may produce bow shocks that can serve as particle acceleration sites. Previous theoretical models predict the
production of high energy photons by non-thermal radiative processes, but their eﬃciency is still debated.
Aims. We aim to test and explain the possibility of emission from the bow shocks formed by runaway stars traveling through the
interstellar medium by using previous theoretical models.
Methods. We apply our model to AE Aurigae, the ﬁrst reported star with an X-ray detected bow shock, to BD+43 3654, in which the
observations failed in detecting high energy emission, and to the transition phase of a supergiant star in the late stages of its life.
Results. From our analysis, we conﬁrm that the X-ray emission from the bow shock produced by AE Aurigae can be explained by
inverse Compton processes involving the infrared photons of the heated dust. We also predict low high energy ﬂux emission from the
bow shock produced by BD+43 3654, and the possibility of high energy emission from the bow shock formed by a supergiant star
during the transition phase from blue to red supergiant.
Conclusions. Bow shock formed by diﬀerent type of runaway stars are revealed as a new possible source of high energy photons in
our neighbourhood.

Key words. Acceleration of particles – radiation mechanism: non-thermal – shock waves – X-rays: ISM – stars individual: AE Aur,
BD+43 3654, Betelgeuse.

1. Introduction

Runaway stars are stars that exceed the typical velocities of the
stars in the galaxy and can reach more than 200 km s−1 (e.g.,
Blaauw 1961; Gies & Bolton 1986). To distinguish them from
the stars with typical velocities and dispersions of the order of
10 km s−1, runaway stars are considered those with V∗ > 30 km
s−1. When these stars move supersonically through the interstel-
lar medium (ISM) and the medium density is dense enough, the
stellar wind sweeps and piles up the circumstellar dust, leading
to the formation of a bow shock in the direction of their move-
ment.

Relativistic particles can be accelerated by strong shocks,
and the interaction of these particles with the matter, the radi-
ation, and the magnetic ﬁeld of the bow shock region can pro-
duce non-thermal emission. Benaglia et al. (2010) detected ra-
dio emission from the bow shock produced by the runaway star
BD+43 3654, consistent with synchrotron radiation produced
by the interaction of the relativistic electrons with the mag-
netic ﬁeld of the acceleration region. Later, del Valle & Romero
(2012) presented a non-thermal emission model that predicted
the production of high energy photons in these acceleration
regions in a number suﬃciently large be detected in X-rays.
L´opez-Santiago et al. (2012) published the ﬁrst detection of X-
ray emission from a bow shock produced by a runaway star (AE
Aurigae), whilst Terada et al. (2012) reported the non-detection
of X-ray emission in the bow shock region formed by BD+43
3654 from a long time X-ray observation with Suzaku.

Due to their strong winds, O and early-B runaway main se-
quence type stars have been traditionally considered to be the
best candidates to form strong bow shocks. With masses higher
than 10 M⊙ and normalsizes between 10 and 50 kK, in their short
life (≤20 Myr) these stars loss mass at a rate of ˙M ∼ 10−7 − 10−5
M⊙ yr−1 and their stellar winds, with velocities ranging from
1000 to 3000 km s−1, transfer great amounts of mechanical en-
ergy to the circumstellar medium. Last searches of runaway O
and early-B are those of Gies & Bolton (1986), Gies (1987),
Moﬀat et al. (1998, 1999) and Ma´ız-Apell´aniz et al. (2004).
More recently, an extensive kinematic and probabilistic study
has led to the identiﬁcation of 2500 candidates of runaway stars
from the data of the Hipparcos catalog (Tetzlaﬀ et al. 2010).

In this work we aim to explain the X-ray emission from the
bow shock formed by AE Aurigae and the non X-ray detection
from the bow shock of BD+43 3654, and also to extend the
study to other runaway stars interacting with the ISM. For this
purpose, we follow the model derived by del Valle & Romero
(2012), where diﬀerent non-thermal processes are proposed to
explain the origin of the emission in these shocks. Further details
on the non-thermal processes are also found in Adams (1980),
Kelner et al. (2006), Longair (2011) or Rybicki & Lightman
(1979), and other contributions to the explanation of the high
energy emission from the bow shocks produced by runaway
stars are those of Benaglia et al. (2010), Terada et al. (2012), and
del Valle & Romero (2014).

2. Applications

L´opez-Santiago et al. (2012) reported the ﬁrst X-ray detection
of a bow shock formed by a runaway star (AE Aurigae).
Terada et al. (2012) did not succeed in detecting signiﬁcant dif-
fuse X-rays from the bow shock formed by the runaway star
BD+43 3654. In this section, we apply our non-thermal model
to clarify the origin of the X-ray emission detected from the bow
shock formed by the star AE Aurigae (HIP 24575), and to try to
explain the non detection in this band of the bow shock formed
by BD+43 3654. Later, we extend our study to other stars to test
wether the bow shocks they form can also be a source of high en-
ergy photons in our galaxy. In particular, we study the bow shock
formed by a supergiant star during the transition from blue to red
using the star Betelgeuse as a test of our computations.

The power available in the acceleration region of a bow
shock is given by the volume ratio, i.e., L = VLT /VR0, where
LT is the kinetic energy released by the stellar wind per second,

2

VR0 is the volume of a sphere of radius R0, and V is the volume
of the acceleration region. R0 is the so called standoﬀ radius ex-
pressed by (Wilkin 1996)

Here, ˙M is the mass-loss rate, Vw the wind velocity, ρIS M (ρa =
nHµ, where nH is the ambient column density in cm−3 and µ =
2.3 × 10−24 g the mass per H atom) is the ambient density and
V⋆ is the stellar velocity. We assume that only a small fraction
qrel of L is turned into relativistic particles and thus the total
energy of the accelerated charged particles is Lrel = qrelL. These
relativistic particles can be either electrons or protons, so Lrel
has both a leptonic and an hadronic component, Lrel = Lp + Le =
aLe + Le where a is the ratio of relativistic protons to electrons.
In the three simulations we perform we assume the medium
the stars are traveling through to be homogeneous and free of
clumps and that the IC seed ﬁelds are isotropic. In Table 1 we list
the stellar parameters of these three stars and the free parameters
we used in our model. The electron to proton ratio, although a
free parameter of the model, was ﬁxed to a = 1 (see explanation
in Sec. 2.1). Both the electron injection index and the fraction of
relativistic energy were ﬁtted to the available observational data
points. The IR shock widths were taken from Peri et al. (2012).
However, the non-thermal emission is produced from a smaller
region, concentrated in a small knot at the bow shock apex, and
hence the ﬁnal shock width is also obtained from ﬁtting the ob-
servational data.

2.1. AEAurigae(AEAur)

The runaway star AE Aur was ejected from the Orion nebula
cluster after an encounter between two, systems about 2.5 mil-
lion years ago, and is considered a runaway star for its high ve-
locity, v∗ ≈ 150 km s−1 (Peri et al. 2012). As a result of this inter-
action, AE Aur and µ Col (both O9.5 type stars) were expelled
at great velocities, while ι Ori remained forming an eccentric bi-
nary system with the two more massive stars (Hoogerwerf et al.
2000). In its path, AE Aur encountered the dense molecular
cloud IC 405, with a density nH ∼ 3 cm−3 (see Peri et al.
2012). The interaction between the strong stellar wind and the
dust resulted in the formation of a bow shock, which was ﬁrst
detected in the mid-IR by Van Buren & McCray (1988) using
IRAS. The terminal wind velocity of the star is vw ≈ 1500 km
s−1 (Hubrig et al. 2011) and its mass-loss rate ˙M ≈ 10−7M⊙ yr−1
(Fullerton et al. 2006). The cooling time rates obtained for these
parameters were represented in Fig. 1.

In Fig. 3 is represented the synthesized luminosity spectrum
of the bow shock formed by the star AE Aur. The X-ray emission
from the bow shock reported by L´opez-Santiago et al. (2012) is
concentrated in a small knot north east of the star and can be
explained by the IC emission of the heated dust, with a very
small contribution of the IC of the starlight. The synchrotron
emission is important at radio frequencies, and the IR is dom-
inated by the thermal emission. The thermal and the relativis-
tic Bremstrahlung are negligible compared to the IC of the dust
and to the IC of the starlight photons. The IC of the CMB re-
sults very faint. The XMM-Newton EPIC pn data obtained by
L´opez-Santiago et al. (2012) are included, and also the Fermi
limit of detection from Acero et al. (2015) is shown.

The hadronic emission produced by the proton-proton in-
elastic collisions is negligible, revealing that the energy released

during the shock interaction is too low to produce high energy
hadronic emission.

On the other hand, if we consider a = 100, as in the cosmic
rays case (Ginzburg & Syrovatskii 1964), we can not reproduce
the X-ray emission detected. In Fig. 2 we proved that there are
not enough p-p collisions and hence there is no generation of
secondary electrons that can produce the required IC ﬂux to ex-
plain the X-ray emission, whilst, as for a = 100 the energy that
goes into electrons is dramatically reduced, neither the primary
electrons are able to reproduce the X-ray ﬂux observed.

2.2. BD+433654

Comer´on & Pasquali (2007) concluded that the origin of the
high velocity of the star BD+34 3654 was the dynamical
interaction between two massive binaries. On the contrary,
Gvaramadze & Bomans (2008) determined that this star was
formed from the stellar fusion of two stars after the encounter
of two binary systems, originally with ∼ 35 and ∼ 50 - 60 M⊙
, respectively. The high linear momentum of the star indicates

that the encounter was very energetic. The most massive object
is now seen as an O4If.

BD+43 3654 has been reported to have formed a bow shock
detected in the IR (Comer´on & Pasquali 2007) and in radio
(Benaglia et al. 2010). Both observations are coincident and ex-
tensive.

is 67 km s−1
the mass-loss rate 10−5 M⊙ yr−1
(Kobulnicky et al. 2010),
(Markova et al. 2004; Repolust et al. 2004), the stellar wind ve-
locity 2300 km s−1 (Howarth et al. 1997), and that the standoﬀ
radius is R0 = 1.5 pc (Peri et al. 2012), from Eq. 1 we derive a
medium density of 5 cm−3. The extensive emission in the radio
and IR wavelengths are found at a distance consistent with R0.

BD+43 3654 has one of the greatest mass-loss rates among
the O and B type stars (see Vink et al. 2001), and the same hap-
pens with the stellar wind (see Howarth et al. 1997). This great
amount of released energy and a moderate velocity allow the
bow shock to be formed far from the star, although the energy is
so high that the star could have crossed the ISM without forming
a strong shock. However, the radio and IR detections discard this
possibility. In this case, the high density of the interstellar region
crossed by the star favors the formation of the shock. Taking
into account these considerations about the stellar parameters of
this star, the values in the nominator of Eq. 1 are revealed to be
among the highest of all the stars known. On the contrary, the
value of the velocity of this star, in the denominator, is moder-
ated. Under these circumstances, a higher velocity would lead
to a closer shock, whereas lower velocities would make BD+43
3654 not to be a runaway star. With such parameters, the bow
shock formed by this star possibly represents an upper limit for
the standoﬀ radius of a bow shock formed by a runaway star. The
radio and IR points allowed us to ﬁt the spectrum and the values
of the free parameters.

The spectrum of the bow shock derived from our model is
shown is Fig. 4. Benaglia et al. (2010) suggest that the detection
of VLA radio emission is associated to the cooling of electrons
by synchrotron emission. However, from our computations the
radio points can be explained by the sum of the non-thermal
synchrotron emission and the thermal emission of the shocked
dust, also consistent with the MSX data at 0.1 eV. Here the IC of
the dust photons, plus the thermal Bremstrahlung, hardly reach
the XMM-Newton detection limit proposed by Hasinger et al.
(2001) for 100 ks. This suggests that the bow shock of BD+43
3654 could be detectable through longer observations. Up to

now, BD+34 3654 was observed with XMM during 47 ks, which
is not enough to detect the bow shock X-ray emission, according
to our simulations. Terada et al. (2012) failed in detecting this
bow shock with Suzaku. From their observation, they obtained
an X-ray luminosity lower limit at 1.1 × 1032 erg s−1, well over
our predictions.

observations from Benaglia et al. (2010).

2.3. Betelgeuse

Mackey et al. (2012) developed stellar evolution models and in-
corporated the evolving stellar wind into hydrodynamic simula-
tions to simulate the transition of Betelgeuse from the blue su-
pergiant (BSG) phase to the red supergiant (RSG) phase at the
late stages of its life. At these phases, massive stars may undergo
rapid transitions from red to blue supergiants and vice versa in
the Hertzprung-Russell diagram, and the stellar wind velocities
change rapidly. Mohamed et al. (2012) found that the bow shock
formed by Betelgeuse is still young (< 30 kyr). The total kinetic
power is rather low, but the star is relatively close and a possible
low X-ray luminosity can still be detectable.

During the transient phase from BSG to RSG the defunct
wind of the BSG still reaches a few hundreds kilometers per
second. At the RSG phase the wind velocity decays down to ∼
20 km/s, and hence the acceleration of particles is ineﬃcient and
the non-thermal processes are not able to produce high energy
photons in a number suﬃciently large to be detected with the
current X-ray telescopes. Here we use the parameters derived
by Mackey et al. (2012) in their simulations to test the possi-
bility of a non-thermal high energy emission in the transition
phase from BSG to RSG, where the kinetic energy of the wind
is still high. The result is showed in Fig. 5. The IC of the dust
photons can lead to the emission of detectable X-ray photons.
We also include the Chandra detection mean limits reported by
Posson-Brown et al. (2006) in the 0.1 - 6 keV range for this star,
although less sensitive than the XMM-Newton limit reported by
Hasinger et al. (2001). Our simulation shows that the most en-
ergetic photons could be detected. However, we have to remind
that the current observations of Betelgeuse do not correspond to
the transition phase from BSG to RSG, but to the present RSG
phase. Hence no detection is expected in the currently phase.

4

Although Betelgeuse is now a RSG star, we use it as a base
to simulate the supergiant stars case and to test the possibility of
non-thermal emission from runaway stars with its characteristics
during the transition phase from BSG to RSG. The X-ray lumi-
nosity is somehow faint, but they can make up a new source of
high energy photons in the neighbourhood of the Earth, although
bow shocks formed during the BSG phase could be detected in
X-rays at greater distances.

3. Discussion and conclusions

We have studied the non-thermal processes that can explain the
emission detected from the bow shock formed by the star AE
Aur and test the possibility of other bow shocks to emit high
energy non-thermal photons in a number suﬃciently large to be
detected. However, the detection of X-ray emission from bow
shocks around runaway stars is not expected to be found around
most of them since many scenarios make the formation and de-
tection of the bow shock unlikely. First, the runaway star must
move supersonically through the ISM, whilst low density medi-
ums do not favor the formation of bow shocks. Second, many
runaway stars can form close bow shocks, which can be de-
tectable in the IR, but the resolution of the X-rays telescopes
currently available fail in resolving bow shocks with short stand-
oﬀ radius from their star. Furthermore, the angle formed by the
line of sight and the star-bow shock line is of the utmost impor-
tance since the bow shock can have been formed far enough from
the star but the angle can make it to be hidden by the runaway
star or make it unresolvable from the star. On the other hand, X-
ray bow shocks reach luminosities orders of magnitude fainter
than the runaway stars that originate them, and hence very long
exposures are needed to detect them.

High mass-loss rates and large wind velocities favor the for-
mation of strong shocks that can emit high energy non-thermal
photons. However, they also make the bow shocks to be formed
farther from the star. The available energy in the acceleration
region depends on the relation between the volume of the accel-
eration region and the volume of a sphere of radius R0. Since
the acceleration region is a nearly ﬂat region, the available ki-
netic energy in the acceleration region depends on the distance

V. Pereira et al.: Modeling non-thermal emission from stellar bow shocks (RN)

between the star and the acceleration region, which is equivalent
to the standoﬀ radius deﬁned by Eq. 1. The volume of a sphere
grows faster with the radius than the volume of the accelera-
tion region, and thus the available energy to accelerate particles
falls quickly with the standoﬀ radius. Hence, the energy den-
sity is proportional to R−3
0 , and from Eq. 1 the standoﬀ radius
is proportional to the inverse of the velocity of the star. These
dependencies imply that if the velocity of the star were a 20%
lower , the energy density available to accelerate particles would
be reduced by a 50%. Large stellar velocities favor the forma-
tion of the bow shock at distances closer to the star, as well as
high ambient medium densities. Fast winds and high mass-loss
rates release great amounts of energy, which allow shocks to be
formed at greater distances from the star. However, if these two
quantities are very high but are not balanced by a dense medium
or by a high velocity of the star, the star can cross the ISM with-
out forming a bow shock (R0 ∼ ∞). This emphasize the point
that the conditions under a bow shock can be formed by a run-
away star, or emit high energy photons, are very constrained, and
suggest that only a small fraction of the bow shocks are expected
to be detected in the X-ray band. In our three simulations the in-
tegrated X-ray ﬂux in the 0.3 - 10 keV band is lower than 1030
erg s−1 (see Figs. 3, 4 and 5). These low luminosities constrain
the search of bright bow shocks to stars closer than 1 kpc, due
to the limited sensitivity of the X-ray telescopes and the expo-
sure times required. Farther stars, as the case of BD+43 3654,
demand very long exposures, but as the emitted X-ray ﬂux from
the bow shock is rather low, the background contamination may
diﬃcult its detection.

Runaway stars can produce bow shocks when passing
through suﬃciently dense clouds. These bow shocks can serve as
particles acceleration sites where charged particles can cool by
non-thermal processes and emit high energy photons. However,
the production of these photons in a suﬃciently large number
to be detected is not possible in all bow shocks. Runaway O
and B-type stars moving through dense molecular clouds, with
the highest mass-loss rates among all the stars and the largest
wind velocities, are considered the most suitable candidates to
have formed a high energy emitting bow shock. However, here
we have showed that runaway supergiant stars in their transi-
tion phase from blue supergiant to red supergiant also undergo
important losses of mass and have moderate terminal velocities,
which make them a new possible source of X-ray photons.

From all the bow shocks detected around runaway stars, only
those formed by the stars AE Aur and BD+43 3654 have been
directly observed in X-rays (although the bow shock formed by
BD+43 3654 has not been detected). For the case of AE Au
we succeed in reproducing the non-thermal emission from the
shock. For the bow shock formed by BD+43 3654 we also ob-
tain the luminosity distribution and show that it emits high en-
ergy photons, but the ﬂuxes are too low to be detected. Farther
observations are needed to constrain the stellar parameters that
favor the shock formation and that can lead to the production of
enough high energy photons to be detectable in the X-ray do-
main, but our model sets a theoretical scenario to constrain the
most reliable candidates to produce high energy emission and to
test its detectability.

Here we have shown that bow shocks formed by diﬀerent
type of runaway stars can account for a signiﬁcant fraction of
the high energy photons produced in our galaxy. More energetic
events in our galaxy, such as supernova remnants, produce a
larger amount of high energy photons, and those sources can be
detected at larger distances. However, the IC losses undergone
