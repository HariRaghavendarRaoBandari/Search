Optical parametric ampliﬁcation/oscillation provide a powerful tool for coherent light generation in spectral
regions inaccessible to lasers. Parametric gain is based on a frequency down-conversion process, and thus it can
not be realized for signal waves at a frequency ω3 higher than the frequency of the pump wave ω1. In this work
we suggest a route toward the realization of up-conversion optical parametric ampliﬁcation and oscillation, i.e.
ampliﬁcation of the signal wave by a coherent pump wave of lower frequency, assisted by stimulated emission
of the auxiliary idler wave. When the signal ﬁeld is resonated in an optical cavity, parametric oscillation is
obtained. Design parameters for the observation of up-conversion optical parametric oscillation at λ3 = 465 nm
are given for a periodically-poled lithium-niobate (PPLN) crystal doped with Nd3+ ions.

Optical frequency conversion in χ(2) nonlinear crys-
tals, such frequency doubling, sum and diﬀerence fre-
quency generation, optical parametric ampliﬁcation
(OPA) and oscillation (OPO), provides a powerful and
ﬂexible tool for the generation and ampliﬁcation of light
waves in spectral regions inaccessible to lasers [1]. Since
more than four decades, a wide variety of coherent light
sources and methods based on frequency conversion pro-
cesses have been realized with important applications to
the generation of of twin photons and other nonclassical
states of light [2, 3], broadband coherent light genera-
tion [4, 5], ultrafast time-domain spectroscopy [6], high-
resolution spectroscopy and metrology [7, 8], and opti-
cal sensing [9, 10]. In the past few years, several novel
schemes of frequency conversion have been introduced,
including cascading and multi-step optical parametric
processes [11,12], mirror-less OPO [13–16], adiabatic fre-
quency conversion [17–19], time-reversal optical para-
metric oscillation [20], hybridly-pumped OPOs [21, 22],
and quasi-parametric optical ampliﬁcation [23], etc.
In ordinary OPO/OPA devices, parametric gain is based
on a frequency down-conversion process: a weak optical
ﬁeld at low frequency ω1 (signal wave) is ampliﬁed by
a strong and of higher frequency ω3 ﬁeld (pump wave)
under phase matching condition. A pump photon in the
crystal annihilates and creates a down-converted pair of
photons, one at frequency ω1 (thus providing signal am-
pliﬁcation) and the other one at frequency ω2 = ω3 − ω1
(the idler wave). When optical feedback (i.e. a cavity) is
provided for the signal wave, parametric oscillation is ob-
tained [Fig.1 (a)]. However, parametric gain can not be
provided for coherent waves at frequencies higher than
the pump wave. Such a possibility would be extremely
useful to generate and amplify high-frequency coherent
waves (in the uv and even X-ray spectral regions), with-
out recurring to low-eﬃcienty schemes like e.g. higher-
order parametric processes [24].

In this Letter a route toward the realization of OPA and
OPO devices, with a pump wave at frequency ω1 smaller
than the signal frequency ω3, is theoretically suggested.
The main idea, sketched in Figs.1(b) and (c), is to ex-
ploit optical gain by stimulated emission available at the
lower frequency ω2 of the idler wave, and to transfer such
a gain into the higher-frequency signal ﬁeld by nonlin-
ear frequency conversion. Can we realize optical gain for
the signal wave at the high frequency ω3, which can not
be provided by stimulated emission? What we can do, is
to down convert the signal wave to a low-frequency ﬁeld
ω2 (the idler wave), for which optical gain by stimulated
emission in an incoherently pumped active medium is
available. After ampliﬁcation, frequency up-conversion,
from ω2 to ω3, is achieved, which results in an overall
ampliﬁcation of the original signal wave at frequency
ω3. A schematic of the three-step parametric ampliﬁca-
tion process assisted by stimulated emission is shown in
Fig.1(c). For the sake of simplicity, we consider a single
nonlinear crystal with quasi phase matching (QPM) ob-
tained by domain inversion and pumped by a CW wave
at frequency ω1. The crystal of length L = 2l + lg com-
prises three sections: a ﬁrst QPM section of length l that
yields perfect phase matching (σ = 1 region) for the
ω2 = ω3 − ω1 interaction and generates the idler wave
via dow-conversion; a second section of length lg with-
out the QPM grating (σ = 0 region) and doped with an
active medium that provides optical gain for the idler
wave; and a third QPM section of length l with reversed
sign of the eﬀective nonlinearity (σ = −1 region) that
realizes back conversion. The equations describing non-
linear interaction of the three ﬁelds in the QPM crystal
with assisted gain at the idler frequency read [25, 26]

wave in the intermediate section by stimulated emission, and
up-conversion (ω2+ω1 → ω3) in the last QPM crystal section.

In the above equations, Bm (m = 1, 2, 3) are dimen-
sionless slowly-varying envelopes of the pump, idler and
signal ﬁelds at frequencies ω1, ω2, and ω3 = ω1 + ω2,
respectively; vgm are the corresponding group velocities;
σ(z) is the normalized strength of the nonlinear interac-
tion in the QPM crystal (σ = 1 for 0 < z < l; σ = 0 for
l < z < lg + l; σ = −1 for l + lg < z < L); and g(z) is
stimulated-emission gain for the idler wave [g(z) = 0
for 0 < z < l, l + lg < z < L and g(z) = g0 for
l < z < l + lg]. The intensities Im of the three waves are
given by Im = ǫ0c0n1n2n3λ1λ2λ3|Bm|2/(8π2l2λmd2
ef f )
(m = 1, 2, 3), where λm = 2πc0/ωm are the wavelengths
in vacuum of the three waves, nm the corresponding re-
fractive indices, and def f is the eﬀective nonlinear d-
coeﬃcient in the QPM crystal. For a +/− square-wave
ﬁrst-order QPM grating with 50% duty cycle and period
Λ = |n3/λ3 − n2/λ2 − n1/λ1|−1, one has def f = (2/π)d,
where d = (1/2)χ(2) is the second-order nonlinear coeﬃ-
cient of the bulk crystal. The sign change of the eﬀective
nonlinearity (σ = ±1) between the ﬁrst and last sec-
tions of the crystal can be obtained, for example, by a π
phase slip of the QPM gratings in the two sections [26].

The parametric gain for the high-frequency ﬁeld ω3 is
obtained by looking for a solution to Eqs.(1) of the form
B2,3(z, t) = A2,3(z) exp(iΩt) and B1(z, t) = A1(z) with
the boundary condition A2(0) = 0, where Ω is the fre-
quency oﬀset from ω3 and G(Ω) = |A3(L)/A3(0)|2 is
the spectral power gain coeﬃcient. The parametric gain
turns to depend on the eﬀective frequency detuning pa-
rameter δl = (1/vg2 − 1/vg3)lΩ/2, the dimensionless in-
tensity I1 = |B1(0)|2 of the incident pump beam, the
gain ampliﬁcation g0lg of the idler wave, and the ratio
x = lg/l. In the undepleted pump approximation, i.e. for
|B3(0)| ≪ |B1(0)|, the (unsaturated) gain is independent
of the intensity level I3 = |B3(0)|2 of the incident signal
wave and reads explicitly

where we have set ρ ≡ p(δl)2 + I1. Figure 2 shows
typical spectral gain curves in the undepleted pump
regime for increasing values of the pump intensity I1 and
for two diﬀerent values of the gain parameter g0lg and

2

for lg/l = 1. Note that the maximum gain is obtained at
δl = 0, i.e. under perfect phase matching in the nonlinear

crystal, and reads Gmax = [1+(exp(g0lg)−1) sin2 √I1]2.
As a function of the pump intensity I1, Gmax shows an
oscillatory behavior, with maxima equal to exp(2g0lg) at
intensity levels such that √I1 is an integer multiple than
(π/2). Such a behavior is readily explained after observ-
ing that, at I1 = π2/4, in the ﬁrst section of the crystal
the signal wave at frequency ω3 is completely converted
into the idler wave, which is then ampliﬁed by the power
factor exp(2g0lg) in the middle crystal section and ﬁnally
fully up-converted into the signal ﬁeld at frequency ω3
in the last section of the crystal. For a pump intensity
I1 smaller than π2/4, the signal/idler conversion is in-
complete, resulting in a lowered gain G for the signal
wave.

In the strong-signal regime, the spectral gain also de-
pends on the incident signal intensity I3 = |B3(0)|2 and
the analytical expression of the spectral gain G is rather
cumbersome, since the exact solution to Eqs.(1) involves
elliptic integrals [25]. However, in this regime the spec-
tral gain curve can be readily obtained by direct numer-
ical integration of Eqs.(1). As in the small-signal regime,
the maximum gain is attained at exact phase matching
δl = 0. Figure 3 shows the numerically-computed be-
havior of the power gain G at δl = 0 as a function of
the pump intensity I1 [panel (a)] and signal intensity I3
[panel (b)], and for a few values of the gain parameter
g0lg. Note that, for small values of the gain parameter
and pump power [curve 1 in Fig.3(b)], the power gain G
at the signal frequency ω3 shows ﬁrst an increase (rather
than a decrease) as I3 is increased from zero, indicating
that there is not gain saturation in this regime.
Given the optical gain at the signal frequency ω3 pro-
vided by the nonlinear crystal of Fig.1(c), an OPO
can be realized by resonating the signal ﬁeld in an op-
tical cavity [Fig.1(b)]. We remark that such an ”up-
conversion” OPO is conceptually very diﬀerent than pre-
viously demonstrated hybridly-pumped singly-resonant
OPOs [21, 22], where stimulated-emission gain is pro-
vided for the signal wave to decrease OPO threshold, or
intracavity frequency up-conversion schemes [27], that
need an externally-injected ﬁeld for wave mixing. With
reference to Fig.1(b), let us assume that the two res-
onator mirrors are fully transparent at the pump and
idler wavelengths, whereas they show reﬂectances R1 = 1
and R2 = R < 1 at the signal wavelength. Since the max-
imum parametric gain is attained at exact phase match-
ing δl = 0, the cavity length is tuned so that a cavity
axial mode is in resonance with the signal wave at fre-
quency ω3. In the OPO scheme, there is not any seeding
signal and oscillation is started from quantum noise at
the signal frequency, like in an ordinary singly-resonant
OPO. Neglecting saturation of gain g0 for the idler wave
and indicating by B(n)
the amplitude of the intracavity
signal ﬁeld at the n-th round trip in the resonator, the
dynamical evolution of B(n)
at successive transits in the

scribes the propagation of the ﬁeld B3(z) in the crystal
[Eqs.(1)], from z = 0 to z = L, subjected to the bound-
ary conditions B3(0) = B(n)
The expression of B3(L) = P(B(n)
) is obtained from the
exact solution to Eqs.(1) in each crystal section, with
dBl/dt = 0, and involves combinations of sn, cn and dn
Jacobi elliptic functions [25]. For a given value of the
gain parameter g0lg, the input-output curve I3 = I3(I1)
of the OPO is obtained by looking for the ﬁxed points
of the map (3). Once the ﬁxed points have been deter-
mined, their stability can be checked by perturbing the
initial condition of the map (3) and propagating at suc-
cessive transits in the cavity. The switch-on dynamics of
the OPO is obtained by iteration of the map (3) starting
from a small amplitude of B(n=1)
at the ﬁrst round-trip,
which mimics semi-classically the quantum noise at the
signal frequency in the cavity. Figure 4 shows two typ-
ical examples of input-output OPO curves correspond-
ing to two diﬀerent values of the linear gain parameter
g0l. Solid and dotted curves correspond to stable and
unstable ﬁxed points of the map (3), respectively. Note
that, for a small gain parameter g0lg, the OPO thresh-
old shows a subcritical behavior with a bistability loop
(hysteresis) close to the threshold pump value [arrows in
Fig.4(a)], whereas the OPO threshold is supercritical for
larger values of the gain [Fig.4(b)]. The subcritical be-
havior of the OPO threshold in the former case can be
explained after observing that the parametric gain of the
signal wave in the nonlinear crystal versus I3, at small
values of the gain parameter g0lg, shows a ﬁrst increase
with I3, while gain saturation occurs at large values of
I3 [curve 1 in Fig.3(b)].
In a slightly modiﬁed up-conversion OPO scheme, the
coherent pump beam at frequency ω1 is used to pro-
vide population inversion in the middle section of the
crystal as well. With respect to the scheme of Figs.1(b)
and (c), such a conﬁguration oﬀers the advantage of re-
quiring a single pump beam. However, in this case the
pump wavelength, and thus the OPO signal wavelength,
is constrained by the absorption properties of the active
medium. The theoretical analysis of the singly-pumped
up-conversion OPO device should be modiﬁed to ac-
count for the linear absorption of the pump wave at λ1
in the middle section of the crystal, and the intensity-
dependent behavior of both absorption coeﬃcient α at
λ1 and of the gain coeﬃcient g at λ2. If the stimulated
emission at the idler wavelength is achieved by doping
the nonlinear crystal with a four-level ampliﬁer system
(such as Nd3+) with density Nt, from simple rate equa-
tion analysis one can derive the following expressions for
absorption and gain coeﬃcients per unit length in the

accounts for space-dependence and saturation eﬀects of

rameter values that apply to Nd3+-doped LiNbO3 OPO
pumped at ∼ 800 nm.
To check the feasibility of the up-conversion OPO
scheme proposed in the present work, let us consider as
an example parametric oscillation of signal wave in the
blue region at λ3 = 465 nm using a PPLN crystal doped
with Nd3+ and pumped at λ1 = 814 nm. Lithum Niobate
(LNB), besides of providing a high nonlinear d coeﬃcient
(d = d33 ≃ 27 pm/V), is a suitable matrix host for rare-
earth solid-state lasers in the near-infrared [28–31]. For
example, gain coeﬃcients as high as g0 ∼ 6.35 dB/cm
at λ2 = 1085 nm have been demonstrated in waveg-
uide LNB crystals doped with Nd3+ ions and optically-
pumped at around 800 nm, with 22 mW absorbed pump
power in a 5.9-mm long crystal [29]. To realized the up-
conversion OPO, let us consider a PPLN crystal of length
L = 3 cm, with l = lg = 1 cm, pumped by a coherent

the same wavelength is used to optically pump the Nd3+

lengths is attained by a grating period Λ ≃ 4.457 µm,
taking into account that nm = 2.155, 2.1744, 2.2704
and vgm/c0 = 0.4639, 0.4598, 0.4404 (m = 1, 2, 3), as
obtained from Sellmeier equations. The intensities in
physical units are given I1 ≃ 0.6108 × I1 MW/cm2,
I2 ≃ 0.458 × I2 MW/cm2, and I3 ≃ 1.07 × I3 MW/cm2.
Assuming typical parameter values σa = 5.5×10−20 cm2,
σe = 1.7 × 10−19 cm2, τ = 114 µs, and η = 0.98 [31],
for a Nd3+ doping of Nt = 2 × 1019 ions/cm3, one has
2αl = 0.55/{1 + 15.386 × I1(z)[1 + 48.2 × I2(z)]−1} and
2gl = 26.157× I1(z)/[1 + 48.2 × I2(z) + 15.386× I1(z)].
For an output coupling T = 1 − R = 10% at λ3, the
OPO input-output curve is the one shown in Fig.5.
In physical units, the OPO pump threshold is given
by I1th ≃ 41 kW/cm2, which for an eﬀective mode
are Ae ∼ 10 µm2 corresponds to the relatively low
pump power threshold P1th ≃ AeI1th ≃ 4.1 mW. For a
pump power twice its threshold value, an output power
P3 ≃ AeRI3/(R − 1) ≃ 2.3 mW in the blue is estimated
from the curve of Fig.5 and assuming approximately the
same area for the signal and pump waveguide modes.

In conclusion, we have suggested the possibility to re-
alize parametric ampliﬁcation and oscillation of a high-
frequency signal wave coherently pumped by a lower fre-
quency pump wave, assisted by stimulated emission of
the auxiliary idler wave. The feasibility of the proposed
scheme has been discussed for a PPLN-based compact
OPO waveguide doped with Nd3+ ions, emitting in the
blue. The ”up-conversion” OPO provides a conceptually
novel method of nonlinear frequency manipulation that
might be useful in the design of compact light sources at
short wavelengths.
