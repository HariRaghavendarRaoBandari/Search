NONCOMMUTATIVE HARMONIC ANALYSIS ON SEMIGROUP AND

ULTRACONTRACTIVITY

XIAO XIONG

Abstract. We extend some classical results of Cowling and Meda to the noncommutative set-
ting. Let (Tt)t>0 be a symmetric contraction semigroup on a noncommutative space Lp(M),
and let the functions φ and ψ be regularly related. We prove that the semigroup (Tt)t>0 is
φ-ultracontractive, i.e. kTtxk∞ ≤ Cφ(t)−1kxk1 for all x ∈ L1(M) and t > 0 if and only if
its inﬁnitesimal generator L has the Sobolev embedding properties: kψ(L)−αxkq ≤ C ′kxkp for
all x ∈ Lp(M), where 1 < p < q < ∞ and α = 1
. We establish some noncommutative
spectral multiplier theorems and maximal function estimates for generator of φ-ultracontractive
semigroup. We also show the equivalence between φ-ultracontractivity and logarithmic Sobolev
inequality for some special φ. Finally, we gives some results on local ultracontractivity.

Let L be a densely deﬁned positive operator on L2(Ω), where Ω is a σ-ﬁnite measure space.

1. Introduction and Main Result

Suppose that {Pλ} is the spectral resolution of L:

Lf =Z ∞

0

λ dPλf , ∀f ∈ Dom(L).

If m is a bounded function on [0, ∞), then by the spectral theorem, the multiplier operator m(L)
deﬁned by

m(L)f =Z ∞

0

m(λ) dPλf , ∀f ∈ L2(Ω),

is bounded on L2(Ω). Let (Tt)t>0 = (e−tL)t>0 be the operator semigroup generated by L and
assume that each Tt has the contraction property:

kTtf kp ≤ kf kp , ∀f ∈ L2(Ω) ∩ Lp(Ω)

whenever 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. A semigroup (Tt)t>0 with the above properties is called a symmetric
contraction semigroup. Stein [24] developed a Littlewood-Paley theory for such semigroups, with
some additional hypotheses. Coifman and Weiss [1], Cowling [3] presented an alternative and
simpler approach to obtain multiplier results and maximal inequalities.

A symmetric contraction semigroup (Tt)t>0 that maps L1(Ω) into L∞(Ω) for every positive t is
said to be ultracontractive. Letting the functions φ and ψ be regularly related (see below for the
precise deﬁnition), Cowling and Meda [4] showed that (Tt)t>0 is φ-ultracontractive, i.e.

if and only if the inﬁnitesimal generator L has Sobolev embedding properties, namely,

kTtf k∞ ≤ Cφ(t)−1kf k1 ∀f ∈ L1(Ω) ∀t ∈ R+,

kψ(L)−αf kq ≤ C′kf kp ∀f ∈ Lp(Ω)

whenever 1 < p < q < ∞ and α = 1

Recently, more attention has been turned to symmetric contractive semigroups on noncommuta-
tive spaces Lp(M), associated to (M, τ ), where M is a von Neumann algebra with a normal ﬁnite
faithful trace τ. Diﬀusion semigroups on noncommutative Lp-spaces were considered for the ﬁrst
time in [11, 12], where the authors developed noncommutative maximal inequalities for such semi-
groups. Based on these, [8] studied a noncommutative generalization of Stein’s diﬀusion semigroups
considered in [24]. Then, [9] studied noncommutative Riesz transform associated to a semigroup
(Tt)t>0 of completely positive maps on a von Neumann algebra with negative generator. BMO
and tent spaces associated with semigroups were developed in [16, 10]. We also refer the reader

to [14] for the result that semigroups on noncommutative Lp-spaces have extension under suitable
conditions, similar to those on commutative Lp-spaces.

In this paper, we study the ultracontractivity of semigroups (Tt)t>0 acting on noncommutative
Lp-spaces. We show that the φ-ultracontractivity of (Tt)t>0 is equivalent to the Sobolev embed-
ding properties of its generator L, and establish some spectral multiplier theorems and maximal
inequalities. This paper can be viewed as the noncommutative extension of [4].

To state our main results, some notation and basic knowledge should be in order. Throughout
this paper, M is a von Neumann algebra with a normal ﬁnite faithful trace τ. Let S+
M be the set
of all positive elements x in M with τ (s(x)) < ∞, where s(x) denotes the support of x, i.e., the
smallest projection e such that exe = x. Let SM be the linear span of S+
M. Then every x ∈ SM
has ﬁnite trace, and SM is a w*-dense ∗-subalgebra of M. Let 0 < p < ∞. For any x ∈ SM, the
operator |x|p belongs to S+

2 ). We deﬁne

M (recalling |x| = (x∗x)

1

kxkp =(cid:0)τ (|x|p)(cid:1) 1

p .

One can check that k · kp is a norm on SM if 1 ≤ p < ∞ and is a p-norm if 0 < p < 1. The
completion of (SM, k · kp) is denoted by Lp(M), which is the usual noncommutative Lp-space
associated to (M, τ ). For convenience, we set L∞(M) = M equipped with the operator norm
k · kM.

We denote by L0(M, τ ) the family of all measurable operators. For such an operator x, we

deﬁne

λs(x) = τ (e⊥

s (|x|)), s > 0

where e⊥

s (x) = 1l(s,∞)(x) is the spectral projection of x corresponding to the interval (s, ∞), and

µt(x) = inf{s > 0 : λs(x) < t}, t > 0.

The function s 7→ λs(x) is called the distribution function of x and µt(x) the generalized singular
numbers of x. Similarly to the classical case, for 0 < p < ∞, 0 < q ≤ ∞, the noncommutative
Lorentz space Lp,q(M) is deﬁned to be the collection of all measurable operators x such that

kxkp,q =(cid:0)Z ∞

(t

q < ∞.

Clearly, Lp,p(M) = Lp(M). The space Lp,∞(M) is usually called a weak Lp-space and

kxkp,∞ = sup

Noncommutative Lp-spaces also behave well with respect to interpolation. Let 1 ≤ p0 < p1 ≤ ∞,
1 ≤ q ≤ ∞ and 0 < η < 1. Then

(cid:0)Lp0 (M), Lp1(M)(cid:1)η = Lp(M) and (cid:0)Lp0(M), Lp1(M)(cid:1)η,q = Lp,q(M),

Let T : M → M be a linear map satisfying
(i) T is a contraction on M: kT xk∞ ≤ kxk∞ ,
(ii) τ ◦ T ≤ τ : for all x ∈ L1(M) ∩ M+, τ (T x) ≤ τ (x),
(iii) T is positive: x > 0 implies T x > 0,
(iv) T is symmetric relative to τ : τ (T (y)∗x) = τ (y∗T (x)) for all x, y ∈ L2(M) ∩ M .
Properties (i), (ii) and (iii) imply kT xkp ≤ kMkp for every 1 ≤ p < ∞ (see[12, Lemma 1.1]).
Thus, T naturally extends to a contraction on Lp(M) for every 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. In this paper, we are
interested in the symmetric positive contraction semigroup (Tt)t>0. This means that for each t > 0
the operator Tt satisﬁes the above (i)-(iv) and that for any x ∈ M, Tt(x) → x in the w∗-topology of
M when t → 0+. Such a semigroup admits an inﬁnitesimal (negative) generator L, i.e., Tt = e−tL.
See [8, 12] for more details.

The norm of a bounded linear operator T on a noncommutative Lp-space Lp(M) or Lorentz
space Lp,q(M) will be denoted by |||T |||p or |||T |||p,q respectively. An operator which is bounded
from Lp(M) to Lq(M) or from Lp(M) to Lq,∞(M) is said to be of strong type (p, q) or weak
type (p, q) respectively. The corresponding norms are denoted by |||T |||p→q and |||T |||p→(q,∞)

respectively. The sector {z ∈ C : | arg(z)| < ω} is denoted by Γω, and the half-plane Γ π
Γ simply. We denote H ∞(D) the space of bounded holomorphic functions on the domain D.
Constants will be denoted by letters A, C etc., sometimes with subscripts to indicate which the
constants depend on.

Now we state the main result of this paper. Given a semigroup Tt and a positive function
φ on R+, we say that Tt is φ-ultracontractive if there exists a constant A such that kTtxk∞ ≤
Aφ(t)−1kxk1 holds for all t > 0. Our main result concerns how such ultracontractive estimates
may be related to the Sobolev inequalities of the inﬁnitesimal generator of Tt. Following [4], we
say that a pair of functions φ : R+ → R+ and ψ : Γ → C is regularly related if
(1) φ is increasing, continuous and surjective;
(2) φ satisﬁes the ∆2 condition: there exists a constant Cφ such that

φ(2t) ≤ Cφφ(t), ∀t ∈ R+;

(3) for all θ ∈ R+, there exists a constant Dφ,θ such that

(4) ψ is holomorphic in Γ, and ψ(z) = ψ(z) for all z ∈ Γ;
(5) for all ω ∈ (0, π

2 ), there exists a constant Cψ,ω such that
inf{|ψ(z)| : z ∈ ΓR,ω} ≥ Cψ,ω sup{|ψ(z)| : z ∈ ΓR,ω}, ∀ R ∈ R+

where ΓR,ω = {z ∈ C : R < Re(z) < 2R, | arg(z)| < ω};

(6) for all θ ∈ R+, there exists a real-valued measurable function φθ, equivalent to φθ in the sense

that the function (cid:12)(cid:12) φ(·)θ

φθ (·)(cid:12)(cid:12) is bounded and bounded away from 0 on R+, with the property that,

then ψθ is equivalent to ψ−θ in the sense that the function |ψ(·)θψθ(·)| is bounded and bounded
away from 0 in any proper sub-sector Γω ⊂ Γ.

Some examples of such pairs are given in [4]:
(a) φ(t) = tα and ψ(z) = zα for positive α;
(b) φ(t) = tα(1 + t)β−α and ψ(z) = zβ(1 + z)α−β for positive α, β ∈ R+;
(c) φ(t) = tα log(2 + t)β and ψ(z) = zα log(2 + 1
The following is our main theorem about ultracontractivity.

z )−β for positive α, β ∈ R+.

Theorem 1.1. Let φ and ψ be a pair of regularly related functions. Then the following properties
are equivalent:

The above theorem will be proved in section 2. In section 3, we will establish multiplier and max-
imal operator results for such ultracontactive semigroups. Let m be a complex-valued measurable
function on R+. Recall that the multiplier operator is deﬁned by

m(L)x =Z ∞

0

m(λ) dPλx,

for x in some appropriate domain. We will give suﬃcient conditions on m to ensure the boundedness
of m(L) from Lp(M) to Lq(M) (or weak Lq). A H¨ormander-like multiplier result will also be
established for ultracontractive semigroup whose generator L satisﬁes

|||Liu|||p ≤ Cp(1 + |u|)σ| 1

p − 1

2 |, ∀ u ∈ R,

or its weak form. Finally in this section, we will investigate the maximal operator supt>0 |tαm(tL)|
acting on M, and also give some additional hypothesis to make it bounded of strong (or weak)
type (p, q).

In section 4, we will show the equivalence between φ-ultracontractivity and the following loga-

rithmic Sobolov inequality for the inﬁnitesimal generator L:

τ (x2 log x) ≤ ετ (xLx) + CM (ε)kxk2

2 + kxk2

2 log kxk2 .

Here φ(t) = e−M(t) with some monotonically decreasing function M (t). In the last section we give
some results for local ultracontractivity.

2. Proof of the Main Theorem

We recall one of the principal results of Jiao and Wang [13], which extends the main result of
[3] to the noncommutative case, and will be a main tool in this section. Suppose that 1 < p < ∞,
and m is a bounded function on [0, ∞). If ω > π| 1
2 |, and m extends to an H ∞(Γω)-function,
denoted mω, then m(L) is of strong type (p, p), and

p − 1

(2.1)

|||m(L)|||p ≤ Cp,ωkmωk∞.

Applying the real interpolation method, we can easily deduce that m(L) is also bounded on
Lq,∞(M) for q lies between 2 and p, and that

(2.2)

|||m(L)|||q,∞ ≤ C′

q,ωkmωk∞.

Like in [13], we also suppose that the spectral projection P0 onto the kernel of L is trivial on Lp(M)
in the sequel.

Let us turn to proving Theorem 1.1. This theorem has been proved by Junge and Mei in [9] for
the special pair of functions (t
2 ). The equivalence of (i), (ii) and (iii), ensured by interpolation
and duality in [9], holds for general φ as well; the proof is exactly the same as the one in the
classical case [4]. To show their relation with the Sobolev inequalities of ψ(L)−α, we will establish
the implications (i)⇒(iv) and (vii)⇒(iii), which are entitled Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 below respectively.

Thus, if x is in L2(M) ∩ Lp(M) and k is large enough, (I − Tt)kx lies in Dom(ψ(L)−β) for all
t ∈ R+. Moreover, as t tends to ∞, (I − Tt)kx tends to x in Lp(M), since the spectral projection
onto the kernel of L is trivial. So that Lp(M) ∩ Dom(ψ(L)−β ) is dense in Lp(M).

Take an x ∈ Lp(M) ∩ Dom(ψ(L)−β). We need to estimate the Lr,∞ norm of ψ(L)−βx. But by

(2.2) and the regular property (6) of (φ, ψ),

kψ(L)−βxkr,∞ = kκ(L) ◦ ψβ(L)xkr,∞ ≤ Ckψβ(L)xkr,∞,

for function κ(z) = [ψ(z)βψβ(z)]−1 whose absolute value is bounded and bounded away from 0 in
any proper sub-cone Γω ⊂ Γ. Thus we are reduced to estimate the Lr,∞ norm of ψβ(L)x.

By deﬁnition, we need to control the trace of 1l(ǫ,∞)(|ψβ(L)x|), namely, λǫ(ψβ(L)x) for ǫ > 0.

To this end, we take s ∈ R+ to be chosen later. By the spectral theory,

Lemma 2.2. Suppose that (Tt)t>0 is a symmetric contraction semigroup and that

kψ(L)−αxkq,∞ ≤ Ckxkp, ∀x ∈ Lp(M)

for some p, q and α satisfying 1 ≤ p < q ≤ ∞ and α = 1

kTtxkr ≤ Ap,q,rφ(t)−β kxkp, ∀t ∈ R+, ∀x ∈ Lp(M).

Proof. We suppose ﬁrst that p > 1. By the spectral theory, we can write for x ∈ L2(M) ∩ Lp(M)
that

Again, by (2.1), we ﬁnd from the hypothesis of the lemma that

Ttx = ψ(L)−α(cid:0)ψ(L)αe−tL(cid:1)x.

kTtxkq,∞ ≤ Ckψ(L)αe−tLxkp ≤ C sup
z∈Γω

for some ω ∈ (0, π

2 ). The hypothesis that the pair (φ, ψ) is regular implies that

sup
z∈Γω

|ψ(z)αe−tz| ≤ C sup
z∈R+

|ψ(z)αe−tz|.

Thus, if we can establish that

(2.3)

|ψ(z)αe−tz| ≤ Cφ(t)−α, ∀t ∈ R+, ∀z ∈ R+,

then it will follow that

kTtxkq,∞ ≤ Cφ(t)−αkxkp, ∀t ∈ R+, ∀x ∈ Lp(M).

Interpolating this with the estimate kTtxkp ≤ kxkp by the real method will then give us that for
p ≤ r < q and β = 1

p − 1
r ,
kTtxkr ≤ Ap,q,rφ(t)−β kxkp, ∀t ∈ R+, ∀x ∈ Lp(M),

as desired.

The claim (2.3) has already been established in [4]. Recall that ψα(z) =R ∞

z ∈ R+. Accordingly, for all t, z ∈ R+, we have

which ensure (2.3).

If p = 1, then 1 < q < ∞. We decompose Ttx = (cid:0)ψ(L)αe−tL(cid:1)ψ(L)−αx, and observe that

ψ(L)−αx ∈ Lq,∞(M). In view of (2.2), a similar argument as the case p > 1 gives the proof of the
case p = 1.

Now we can conclude the proof of Theorem 1.1. By using the real interpolation method between

(iv) and its dual estimate, namely

kψ(L)−αf k∞ ≤ Crkf kr′,1 ∀f ∈ Lr′,1(M),

one can show that (iv) implies (v), and that the constant in (v) depends linearly on that in (iv).
Trivially, (v) implies (vi) and (vi) implies (vii). These complete the proof of the theorem.

3. Multiplier and Maximal Operators

(cid:3)

3.1. Multiplier operators. In this section, L is again the generator of a φ-ultracontractive semi-
group (Tt)t>0 on M, and (φ, ψ) a pair of regularly related functions. We intend to ﬁnd conditions
on the function m such that the operator m(L) extends to a bounded operator from Lp(M) to
Lq(M). Firstly we treat the case p = q. For a Borel measurable function m(·) on R+, its Mellin
ξ-transform is deﬁned by

[Mξm](u) =Z ∞

Given a nonnegative integer N , we denote mN (t, η) the function

mN (t, η) = (tη)N e− tη

2 m(η), ∀t, η ∈ R+,

and MξmN the Mellin ξ-transform of mN with respect to the second variable is then

In particular, MmN denotes the Mellin transform of mN :

Now we need to check that this decomposition of the operator m(L) is legitimate.

Indeed, the function Λu deﬁned above extends to a holomorphic function in the right half-plane

of C, and for η ∈ Γ π

Thus, by (2.1), |||Λu(L)|||p ≤ Cp for all u in R. Therefore, (3.1) ensures that

On the other hand, since u 7→ au(η) and u 7→ ηiu are continuous functions for each η ∈ R+,
u 7→ au(L) and u 7→ Liu are strong operator topology continuous functions. Finally, we ﬁnd that
decomposition (3.3) is convergent, and ﬁnish the proof of the strong type conclusion. Repeating
the argument above, we can prove the weak type conclusion.

(cid:3)

Some consequences of the above theorem are immediate. In the following one, the hypothesis

of Theorem 3.1 can be veriﬁed by the classical Paley-Wiener Theorem for Mellin transforms.

Corollary 3.2. Suppose that 1 < p < ∞ and A, ε > 0, and that |||Liu|||p ≤ Aeε|u| for all u ∈ R.
If m extends to a bounded holomorphic function mω on Γω, where ω > ε, then m(L) extends to a
bounded operator on Lp(M), and |||m(L)|||p ≤ Cω,εAkmεk∞.

Proof. Since ω > ε > 0, we can choose ε1 ∈ (ε, ω). By the relationship between Mellin transforms
and Fourier transforms, we have

with Gt(·) = mN (t, e·−iε1 ). Since m extends to a bounded holomorphic function mω on Γω with
ω > ε1, we can apply classical Paley-Wiener Theorem to Gt(·). This gives that [MmN ](t, u)eε1u
is L2(R+, du) bounded, uniformly on t > 0. By a similar argument for mN (t, e·+iε1 ), we see that
[MmN ](t, u)e−ε1u is L2(R \ R+, du) bounded, uniformly on t > 0. Thus (3.1) is fulﬁlled by the
above discussion and the H¨older inequality, since |||Liu|||p ≤ Aeε|u|.

(cid:3)

Another special case of Theorem 3.1 concerns the function satisfying the H¨ormander condition.
Suppose that χ ∈ N and α ∈ R+. A function m satisﬁes the H¨ormander condition of order (α, χ)
if there exists a constant C such that

|ψ(R)|αZ 2R

sup
R>0

|ηjm(j)(η)|

dη

≤ C, ∀j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , χ}.

The smallest constant C for which the above inequality holds is called the H¨ormander (α, χ)-
constant of m. For such a function m, one can check that, by a direct calculation, the hypothesis
of Theorem 3.1 holds (see [15, Theorem 4]). Thus we have the following

Corollary 3.3. Suppose that m satisﬁes the H¨ormander condition of order (0, χ) with H¨ormander
(0, χ)-constant C. Fix p ∈ (1, ∞) and A, ξ ∈ R+. If |||Liu|||p ≤ A(1 + |u|)ξ for all u ∈ R and
χ > ξ + 1, then m(L) extends to a bounded operator on Lp(M), and |||m(L)|||p ≤ CξAC. Similarly,
if |||Liu|||p,∞ ≤ A(1 + |u|)ξ for all u ∈ R and χ > ξ + 1, then m(L) extends to a bounded operator
on Lp,∞(M), and |||m(L)|||p,∞ ≤ C′

ξAC.

In the rest of this subsection, we prove some results for the case p < q. We assume that there

exists a positive number σ such that for 1 < p < ∞,

(3.5)

or

(3.6)

|||Liu|||p ≤ Cp(1 + |u|)σ| 1

p − 1

2 |, ∀u ∈ R

|||Liu|||p,∞ ≤ C′

p(1 + |u|)σ| 1

A notation is introduced here for convenience: Given p, q satisfying 1 ≤ p ≤ q ≤ ∞, d([p, q], 2) is
deﬁned to be minr∈[p,q] | 1

r − 1
2 |.

Corollary 3.4. Assume that m extends to an analytic function in the cone Γω and that

|ψ(η)αm(η)| < ∞

sup
η∈Γω

for some α ∈ (0, 1). Then m(L) extends to a bounded operator from Lp(M) to Lq(M), provided
that 1 ≤ p < q ≤ ∞, d([p, q], 2) < ω
q , and to an operator of weak type (1, r) if
1 < r < ∞, d([1, r], 2) < ω

π and α = 1

p − 1

π and α = 1 − 1
r .

Proof. We consider only the strong type result, since the weak one will follow from the same
argument. Choose r ∈ [p, q] such that | 1

2 | = d([p, q], 2), and denote

r − 1

β =

Then for all η ∈ R+, m(η) = ψ(η)−γ[ψ(η)αm(η)]ψ(η)−β , which gives
m(L) = ψ(L)−γ[ψ(L)αm(L)]ψ(L)−β.

By the hypothesis of φ-ultracontractivity of the semigroup (Tt)t>0, we ﬁnd that the ﬁrst factor
ψ(L)−γ is bounded from Lp(M) to Lr(M), and the third factor ψ(L)−β bounded from Lr(M) to
Lq(M). By Corollary 3.2, and the hypothesis on the function m, the second one [ψ(L)αm(L)] is
(cid:3)
bounded on Lr(M). In summary, we have proved the desired conclusion.

A direct consequence from the above conclusion is for those m that satisfy the H¨ormander

condition, by the aide of Corollary 3.3.

Corollary 3.5. Suppose that m satisﬁes a H¨ormander condition of order (α, χ) where 0 < α < 1
and χ ∈ N less than σ
2 + 1. Then m(L) extends to a bounded operator from Lp(M) to Lq(M) for
1 < p < q < ∞ and α = 1
q , and to an operator of weak type (1, r) for 1 < r < ∞ and α = 1 − 1
r .

Remark 3.6. The above hypothesis of m can be replaced by a stronger condition:

sup
η∈R+
for some integer no less than σ

2 + 1 and some α ∈ (0, 1).

|ψ(η)αηjm(j)(η)| ≤ C, ∀j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , χ},

3.2. Maximal operators. To present the results on noncommutative maximal operators, we need
to recall some knowledge of noncommutative maximal functions. These were ﬁrst introduced by
Pisier [19] and Junge [7]. Let 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, Lp(M; ℓ∞) is deﬁned to be the space of all sequences
x = (xn)n≥1 in Lp(M), which admit a factorization of the following form: there exist a, b ∈ L2p(M)
and a bounded sequence y = (yn) in L∞(M) such that

The norm of x ∈ Lp(M; ℓ∞) is given by

xn = aynb, n ≥ 1.

kxkLp(M; ℓ∞) = inf{kak2p sup
n≥1

kynk∞kbk2p},

where the inﬁmum is taken over all such factorizations above. This norm makes Lp(M; ℓ∞) a
Banach space. The norm is usually denoted by ksup+
n≥1xnkp is just a
notation since supn≥1 xn does not make any sense in the noncommutative setting. Moreover, this
deﬁnition can be extended to an arbitrary index set J: the space Lp(M; ℓ∞(J)). One can easily
check that a family (xj )j∈J in Lp(M) belongs to Lp(M; ℓ∞(J)) if and only if

n≥1xnkp. But note that ksup+

J1⊂J,J1 ﬁnite

And if this is the case, we have

+xjkp =

+xjkp.

More recently, Dirksen considered more general maximal operator spaces in the noncommutative
setting, which allows us to consider the space Lp,q(M; ℓ∞), the space of sequences x = (xn)n≥1
with entries in noncommutative Lorentz space Lp,q(M). We omit the details and refer the reader
to [6].

In this subsection we focus on the maximal operator

(3.7)

x 7→ (tαm(tL)x)t>0,

where α is a nonnegative real number. The following theorem gives some suﬃcient conditions on m
so that the above maximal operator is of strong (or weak) type (p, q), i.e. bounded from Lp(M) to
Lq(M; L∞(R+)) (or Lq,∞(M; L∞(R+)) respectively). Here, we deal with the semigroups (Tt)t>0
satisfying the estimate that for some positive ν,

kTtxk∞ ≤ At−ν kxk1, ∀t ∈ R+, ∀x ∈ L1(M),

which we call ν-ultracontractivity.

Theorem 3.7. Let (Tt)t>0 be a ν-ultracontractive symmetric contraction semigroup with the gen-
erator L, so that L−α (by Theorem 1.1) is of weak type (1, r) and of strong type (p, q), where
1 < p < q < ∞, 1 < r < ∞, and 1 − 1
q = α

10

then the operator (3.7) is of weak type (1, r).

Proof. As usual, we just prove the strong type conclusion of this theorem. By the spectral theory
and the inverse Mellin transform, we have

4. Ultracontractivity and Logarithmic Sobolov Inequalities

In this section we consider the φ-ultracontractive semigroup with φ(t) = e−M(t) for some de-

creasing function M (t). Namely,

(4.1)

|||Tt|||1→∞ ≤ eM(t),

t > 0.

This φ may not satisfy the conditions in the deﬁnition of regularly related in general. So we can
not get Sobolev inequality for its generator from Theorem 1.1. But we can follow the method in
[5], to characterize (4.1) by the following logarithmic Sobolov inequality:

(4.2)

τ (x2 log x) ≤ ετ (xLx) + CM (ε)kxk2

2 + kxk2

2 log kxk2 .

Here again C is a positive constant. The main result of this section is

Theorem 4.1. Let (Tt)t>0 be a ultracontractive semigroup satisfying (4.1). Then there exist a
positive constant C such that (4.2) holds for all positive x ∈ Dom(L) ∩ L1(M) ∩ L∞(M) and all
ε > 0.

Conversely, if (4.2) is true for all positive x ∈ Dom(L) ∩ L1(M) ∩ L∞(M) and all ε > 0, then

(4.1) holds for the function M (t) = 2C

t R t

0 M (s)ds.

Our argument is standard, following the classical proofs in [5]. See also [18] for the noncommu-
tative case. For concrete examples about the function M (t), we refer to [5, Section 2.3]. Before
passing to the proof, we do some preparation. The following two lemmas are well-known. See [18].

q is diﬀerentiable on q ∈ (1, +∞)

Noncommutative harmonic analysis and ultracontractivity

11

We also need the Lp regularity of Dirichlet forms Dom(L) ∋ x 7→ τ (xαLx), α > 1. Note
that (Tt)t>0 in our paper is positive, symmetric, contractive. Thus the Dirichlet forms process
automatically the Lp regularity. The following proposition was deduced by a group of Professor
Quanhua Xu, in a seminar on the topic of hypercontractivity, in Wuhan University 2013. See also
[22].

Proposition 4.4. Let x ∈ Dom(L) be a strictly positive element and q ≥ 2, 1
have

q + 1

q∗ = 1. Then we

τ(cid:16)x

2

q∗ L(x

2

q )(cid:17) ≤

τ (xLx).

The proof requires the following lemma.

Lemma 4.5. Suppose that A is a ultraweakly dense C*-subalgebra of M. Let x ∈ A be a normal
element and P : A → A be a positive map. Denote K = σ(x). Then there exists a positive measure
µ on K × K with kµk ≤ kP k such that

∀φ, ψ ∈ C(K),

φ(t)ψ(s) dµ(t, s).

τ (φ(x)P (ψ(x))) =ZK×K

Proof. Set Φ : C(K) → A to be the function calculus of x. Then Φ and P ◦ Φ are positive,
and hence are completely positive since C(K) is a commutative algebra (see e.g. [2, 34.4]). Thus
Φ⊗(P ◦Φ) extends to a completely positive map from C(K)⊗max C(K) to A⊗max A ([20, Corollary
11.3]). Deﬁne a state W : A ⊗max A → C by W (a ⊗ b) = τ (ab). Then W ◦ (Φ ⊗ (P ◦ Φ)) is a
positive map on C(K) ⊗max C(K) which is equal to C(K) ⊗min C(K) = C(K × K) since C(K) is
nuclear ([17, 6.4.15]). Therefore by Riesz’s theorem, there exists a positive measure µ on K × K
with kµk ≤ kW ◦ (Φ ⊗ (P ◦ Φ))k ≤ kΦkkP ◦ Φk ≤ kP k such that for any f ∈ C(K × K),

W ◦ (Φ ⊗ (P ◦ Φ))(f ) =ZK×K

f dµ,

which is exactly the desired result if we take f = φ ⊗ ψ.

(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 4.4. Note that the domain Dom(L) consists of all elements x such that

lim
t→0

Ttx − x

q ∈ Dom(L) if x is invertible. Thus τ (x

Now we ﬁx t > 0 and apply the precedent lemma with P = Tt. We consider the function

h : R → R,

θ 7→ τ (x2−θTt(xθ)).

The lemma yields that for K = σ(x) ⊂ (0, +∞),

whence

h(θ) =ZK×K

u2−θvθ dµ(u, v) =ZK×K
u2(cid:0) v
u(cid:1)θ
u(cid:17)θ(cid:16)log(cid:16) v
u(cid:17)(cid:17)k

u2(cid:16) v

h(k)(θ) =ZK×K

dµ(u, v)

dµ(u, v) .

Therefore h(2k)(θ) ≥ 0 for all k ≥ 1. Moreover for θ ∈ [0, 1], by symmetry,

h(1 + θ) = τ (x1−θPt(x1+θ)) = τ (Pt(x1−θ)x1+θ) = h(1 − θ),

so h(2k+1)(1) = 0 for all k ≥ 0.

Therefore by Taylor’s formula, for all θ ∈ [0, 2],

h(θ) = h(1) +

Divide the above inequality by t and let t → 0, then we obtain the desired result.

(cid:3)

Now we are ready to give

Proof of Theorem 4.1. We ﬁrst assume the ultracontractivity of the semigroup. For every real
number y, denote

Tiyx = eiyLx =Z ∞

0

eiyλ dPλx .

Then Tiy is well-deﬁned on L2(M). And since |eiyλ| = 1 for all real y and λ, Tiy is unitary and
If |||Tt|||1→∞ ≤ eM(t) for all t > 0, Theorem 1.1 gives
thus has operator norm 1 on L2(M).
2 M(t) for every y ∈ R. Now we apply Stein’s

In this section we study semigroups with local ν-ultracontractive properties:

(5.1)

kTtxk∞ ≤ At−ν kxk1, ∀t ∈ (0, 1), ∀x ∈ L1(M).

5. Localizations

Like what Theorem 1.1 has done, we are going to characterize (5.1) by (nonhomogeneous) Sobolev
inequalities. For the sake of simplicity, we consider only the Sobolev inequalities for Lαν, from L2
to Lq, with α = 1

q . Our main result of this section is

Theorem 5.1. Property (5.1) is equivalent to

(5.2)

kxkq ≤ C(kLαν xk2 + kxk2) , ∀ x ∈ Dom(L),

where q > 2, α = 1

2 − 1
q .

Firstly we establish that (5.1) implies (5.2).

In fact, we can prove this implication for more

general case.

Proposition 5.2. Let (φ, ψ) be a pair of regularly relative functions. Assume in additional that

(5.3)

φ(ts) ≥ Cφφ(t)φ(s), ∀ t, s > 0 .

Let q > 2, α = 1

2 − 1

q . Then

(5.4)

implies

(5.5)

kxkq ≤ C(kψ(L)αxk2 + kxk2) , ∀ x ∈ Dom(L),

kTtxk∞ ≤ Aφ(t)−1kxk1, ∀t ∈ (0, 1), ∀x ∈ L1(M),

where the constant A depends only on φ, α and the constant C in (5.4).

14

X. Xiong

Proof. Putting T1x in (5.4), we have

kT1xkq ≤ C(kψ(L)αT1xk2 + kxk2) .

Note that ψ(L)αT1 = m(L) with m(λ) = ψ(λ)αe−λ. Since (φ, ψ) is regularly relative,

Lebesgue’s monotone convergence theorem then ensures

Then we know that m(·) is a bounded function on R+, whence kψ(L)αT1xk2 ≤ Ckxk2. Thus we
obtain

(5.6)

kT1xkq ≤ Ckxk2 .

Moreover, putting (I − T1)kx in (5.4), where k is a positive integer to be chosen later, we have

(5.7)

k(I − T1)kxkq ≤ C(kψ(L)α(I − T1)kxk2 + k(I − T1)kxk2)

≤ C(kψ(L)αxk2 + kψ(L)−α(I − T1)kψ(L)αxk2) .

We will show that ψ(L)−α(I − T1)k is bounded on L2(M). Again, it suﬃces to show the bound-
edness of m1(λ) = ψ(λ)− α

is then bounded for λ ∈ (0, 1). This gives the boundedness of ψ(L)−α(I − T1)k on L2(M). Thus
(5.7) reads

(5.8)

k(I − T1)kxkq ≤ Ckψ(L)αxk2

for chosen k. Note that this k depends on φ and α.

We now use (5.3), (5.6) and (5.8) to deduce (5.5). Indeed, rewrite

Tt(I − T1)k = ψ(L)−α(I − T1)kψ(L)αTt .

Here, the last supremum is bounded, following from the discussion in ﬁrst part of this proof. Thus
|||mt(L)|||2 ≤ Cφ(t)−α. Applying (5.8), we have

|||Tt(I − T1)k|||2→q ≤ Cφ(t)−α .

It follows from (5.6) that for x ∈ L2(M),

kTtxkq ≤ kTt(I − T1)kxkq + X1≤j≤k

Cj,kkTt+jxkq

≤ Cφ,α(φ(t)−α + 1)kxk2 .

Deﬁne a new semigroup eTt = e−tTt. Then keTtxkq ≤ Cφ,αφ(t)−αkxk2. By Theorem 1.1, we have

which gives (5.5).

To prove the converse implication, we need to introduce the subordinated semigroups. See
[27, Section IX.11] for more details. The subordinated semigroup of order α ∈ (0, 1) of Tt is the
semigroup

Tt,α =Z ∞

ft,α(s)Tsds ,

(cid:3)

where ft,α is the function whose Laplace transform is the function z 7→ e−tzα
(Tt,α)t>0 is then a semigroup, whose the inﬁnitesimal generator is given by

The function ft,α is determined by the Post-Widder inversion formula

where ρ(a) = e−taα

Whence

Now we are able to conclude the proof of Theorem 5.1. The argument below is verbatim the

same as in the commutative case. See [25].

End of proof of Theorem 5.1. Firstly we assume that αν < 1. By (5.1) and the contractivity of
Tt, we have

|||Tt|||1→∞ ≤ A , ∀ t ≥ 1.

Consider the semigroup ¯Tt = e−tTt,αν with inﬁnitesimal generator I + Lαν. The above inequality
gives

||| ¯Tt|||1→∞ ≤ Ct− 1
It then follows from Theorem 1.1 that ∀ x ∈ Dom(L),

Thus the theorem follows from induction and the fact that, for an operator P on L2(M)

kP xk2 ≤ C(kxk2 + kP 2xk2),

which is ensured by the spectral theorem and the easy inequality t ≤ 1 + t2 for 0 < t < ∞.

(cid:3)

We end this section with a result of localization at inﬁnity, parallel to Theorem 5.1.

Theorem 5.3. Assume that |||T1|||1→∞ < ∞. Then the property

(5.11)

is equivalent to

(5.12)
where q > 2, α = 1

2 − 1
q .

kTtxk∞ ≤ At−ν kxk1, ∀t ∈ (1, ∞), ∀x ∈ L1(M),

kxkq ≤ C(kLαν xk2 + kLαν xkq) , ∀ x ∈ Dom(L),

Proof. Firstly we prove the implication (5.12)⇒(5.11). By interpolation, |||T1|||1→∞ < ∞ implies
|||T1|||2→q < ∞, whence

kLαν T1xkq ≤ CkLανxk2.

(5.12) then gives

kT1xkq ≤ C(kLαν T1xk2 + kLαν T1xkq) ≤ CkLαν xk2.

Writing Tt+1 = T1L−αν Lαν Tt, we deduce from the last inequality that
(5.13)

|||Tt+1|||2→q ≤ C|||T1L−αν|||2→q|||Lαν Tt|||2→2 ≤ Ct−αν .

Now for r > 1 and x ∈ L1(M), set

K(r, x) = sup

If 1 < t < r, it follows from (5.13) that

On the other hand, since |||T1|||1→∞ < ∞, we have a uniform constant A such that

tν(1− 1

sup
1<t≤3

Therefore, we can ﬁnd a constant C independent of r and x such that

tν(1− 1

Thus we have for every t > 1,

Then, to conclude the proof of (5.11), we need only to use a dual argument starting from (5.13).

For the opposite, we ﬁrst assume that αν < β. Note that

L−αν T1x =Z ∞

Then the proof of Lemma 2.1 can be adapted to give

kT1xkq ≤ CkLαν xk2.

Moreover, for 0 < β < 1, the subordinate semigroup (Tt,β)t>0 satisﬁes

L−αν T1,β x =Z ∞

whence also

It then follows that

kT1,βxkq ≤ CkLανxk2.

kxkq ≤ kT1,β xkq + k(I − T1,β)xkq ≤ CkLαν xk2 + k(I − T1,β)xkq.

So it remains to establish the term k(I − T1,β)xkq, which is controlled by

k(I − T1,β)xkq ≤Z 1

0

kLβTt,βxkqdt ≤ CkLανxkq.

The general case where αν ≥ β can be treated by considering the power of I − T1,β, similar to the
last step of the proof of Theorem 5.1.
