Abstract—The propagation of light through bianisotropic ma-
terials is studied in the geometrical optics approximation. For
that purpose, we use the quartic general dispersion equation
speciﬁed by the Tamm-Rubilar tensor, which is cubic in the
electromagnetic response tensor of the medium. A collection of
different and remarkable Fresnel (wave) surfaces is gathered,
and uniﬁed via the projective geometry of Kummer surfaces.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Fresnel wave surface of an electromagnetic medium
with distinct anisotropic permittivities has four isolated singu-
lar points (Figure 1). As soon as anisotropic permeabilities and
magnetoelectric terms are also considered, the number of sin-
gularities can exceed four (Figure 2). We propose a local and
linear material whose Fresnel surface displays sixteen singular
points (Figure 3). Because the general dispersion equation is
quartic, this is the maximum allowed number of singularities
[11]. To realize such extreme light-propagation geometries,
one can take advantage of metamaterials. We suggest that
mixtures of metal bars, split-ring resonators and magnetized
particles yield the correct permittivities, permeabilities and
magnetoelectric terms [6].

II. UNUSUAL AND BEAUTIFUL FRESNEL SURFACES

In this talk, uncommon and beautiful Fresnel surfaces are
visualized and explored, both by resorting to the literature [4],
[13], [16], [18], [20], and by generating new images such as
Figure 4. We also describe the physical speciﬁcations of the
(meta)materials that correspond to the surfaces.

III. STEINER’S ROMAN SURFACE

As an example of unusual wave geometry, a linear material
is proposed whose Fresnel surface coincides with the Roman
surface. Figure 5 portrays this surface, whose name refers
to the Italian city where it was invented by Swiss mathe-
matician Jakob Steiner during a visit in 1844 [3], [8]. The
Roman surface has delightful properties, for instance, it can
be constructed from a M¨obius band and a disk by sewing the
only edge of the former to that of the latter [7]. For light
propagation, this geometry is realized by the medium

Here, u is a nonvanishing parameter, while ε0 and µ0 have
the usual meaning.

Even though the permittivity matrix is zero, the constitutive
law (1)–(4) is invertible, so that one can write E and B as
functions of D and H. In fact, the determinant associated to
the medium does not vanish,

Similarly, because the permeability matrix is invertible [15],
the constitutive law (1)–(4) can be reformulated with D
and B in terms of E and H. This way of pairing up the
electromagnetic ﬁelds is standard among engineers.

One can show that the dispersion equation of the medium

where ω is the angular frequency, k = (k1, k2, k3) is the wave
vector, and c = (ε0µ0)− 1
2 . Notably, (6) determines both the
Roman surface of Figure 5, and how light propagates inside
the medium. Therefore, the geometry of Steiner’s invention is
reproduced by the electromagnetic waves.

By inspection, or by algebraic calculation, one veriﬁes that
the Roman surface in Figure 5 has three singular lines, namely
the three coordinate axes. This makes the origin a peculiar kind
of singularity called triple point. It is probable that, with regard
to the motion of electromagnetic waves, the special lines and
the triple point cause very interesting effects.

The decomposition of Hehl and Obukhov [9] breaks up the
material-law in three relativistic covariant parts. Most media
consist only of a principal part. It is however possible that a
material displays a nonvanishing skewon or axion part. For
instance, measurements on Chromium Sesquioxide (Cr2O3)
show that this crystal has a nonzero axion part, as well as
a ﬁnite principal part [10]. Even though the medium (1)–(4)
yields the unusual Roman wave surface, its Hehl-Obukhov
decomposition is rather ordinary. With the help of (2) and
(3), one veriﬁes that the block matrix in (1) is symmetric, so
that the skewon part must be zero. Then, the magnetoelectric
matrix (4) is traceless, whereby the axion part vanishes. In
summary, the constitutive law (1)–(4) exhibits no more than a
principal part.

As discussed in [21], the Roman surface is a special example
of Kummer surface. This can be regarded as a consequence
of the identity between Fresnel and Kummer surfaces, which
holds true for all media having zero skewon part (see below).

IV. TAMM-RUBILAR TENSOR AND KUMMER SURFACES
Fresnel surfaces are determined by a general Tamm-Rubilar
tensor, cubic in the medium parameters. We plan to review
the corresponding literature [5], [9], [12], [15], [17], and to
demonstrate how this tensor brings order into the zoo of
different wave surfaces for electromagnetic materials.

Another unifying principle is the identity of Fresnel and
Kummer surfaces [1], [2], which can be described as follows:
Fresnel surfaces of local and linear materials with zero skewon
part are, with regard to projective geometry, Kummer surfaces.
Moreover, every Kummer surface can be interpreted as the
Fresnel surface of a medium with vanishing skewon part.

This equivalence allows one to make an important observa-
tion about the singular points. It is known from classic pro-
jective geometry that Kummer surfaces have exactly sixteen
isolated singularities over the complex numbers [14], [19]. The
same is then valid for the Fresnel surfaces of materials with
zero skewon part. One should take note of the requirement to
work over the complex numbers. The surface in Figure 3 has
sixteen real singular points, which can be visualized through
rotations. By contrast, the surface in Figure 1 has twelve
complex singular points, which are impossible to depict. This
explains why only four real singularities can be seen in the
plot. A subtlety concerning singular points that are not ﬁnite
is discussed in [6], but neglected here. Future research will
investigate the physical meaning of complex singularities on
Fresnel surfaces.
