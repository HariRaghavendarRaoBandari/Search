Abstract

Data Collections

In this work, we compare GDELT and Event Registry, which
monitor news articles worldwide and provide big data to re-
searchers regarding scale, news sources, and news geography.
We found signiﬁcant differences in scale and news sources,
but surprisingly, we observed high similarity in news geogra-
phy between the two datasets.

Introduction

The philosophy of computational journalism has been shap-
ing a new research direction on journalism. Research that
usually involves survey participants is now being conducted
by using large-scale data.

One of the outstanding efforts in this research area is
the GDELT project1, which monitors “the world’s broad-
cast, print, and web news from nearly every corner of every
country in over 100 languages” (Leetaru and Schrodt 2013).
GDELT translates all other languages into English through
a collaboration with Google Ideas, and adds metadata, such
as a location where an event happens, to each news article.
A vast array of studies from prediction (Heaven 2013) to
analysis (Kwak and An 2014) and comparison with private
data (Ward et al. 2013) have been published to explore the
potential of the dataset.

On the other hand, recently, a new platform called Event
Registry (ER)2 has been launched. It offers a large collection
of news articles through the public API (Rupnik et al. 2015).
In this work, we compare GDELT and ER in terms of
scale, news sources, and news geography. Given that there
is no ground truth of world news datasets, we believe that
the best effort to understand the beneﬁt and limitation of the
existing datasets is a comparison of the two publicly avail-
able datasets.

Two datasets showed stark differences in terms of the
number of news articles and sources being indexed. Thus,
we suggest that the dataset be used with caution. However, at
the same time, we found that news geographies drawn from
two datasets were extremely similar, indicating that the over-
all trend of international news coverage seems to be consis-
tent.

Given that there is a rate limit in using Event Registry,
it is infeasible to compare the entire datasets of two ser-
vices. Thus, we sample the two datasets. We use the ﬁrst
day of every month from March to December 2015, to avoid
temporary ﬂuctuations. We exclude the ﬁrst day of January
and February because GDELT v2.1 has been available since
February 18, 2015.

We collect all compressed dump ﬁles for English3 and
Translingual4 during the 10 target days. For each day,
GDELT releases 4 × 24 × 2 = 192 ﬁles (one ﬁle each every
15 minutes for English and Translingual). As a result, we
collect 192 × 10 = 1920 compressed ﬁles from the GDELT
project.

Unlike GDELT, Event Registry offers API to access their
data. We query the indexed articles in the ﬁrst day of each
month by using QueryArticles().setDateLimit() and collect
all of them with pagination. We also query all the details
of the articles and sources. We upload the code snippet in
Github Gist5.

One of the most important criteria for the comparison is
the scale of a dataset because it describes how comprehen-
sive the dataset is. Figure 1 shows the number of articles
indexed by the two platforms on the ﬁrst day of each month
from March to December 2015. The daily volumes of news
articles over time are highly ﬂuctuating in both datasets.
Such ﬂuctuation is mainly because news media publishes a
different number of articles on weekdays and weekends. All
three lower bars in the GDELT dataset represent the num-
ber of indexed articles on weekends [March (Sunday), Au-
gust (Saturday), and November (Sunday)]. While the plot
representing ER does not entirely follow the “high in week-
day, low in weekend” pattern, a positive correlation exists
between two time-series from GDELT and ER (Pearson cor-
relation coefﬁcient r=0.57, p=0.08).

Another interesting observation is that GDELT consis-
tently indexes 2.26 times (May) to 6.43 times (June) more
articles than ER, even with high ﬂuctuations over time. To
better understand where this signiﬁcant difference comes
from, we quantitatively examine the sources of the articles
indexed by GDELT. GDELT explicitly announces that it col-
lects documents not only from the world wide web but also
from “broadcast, print, or other ofﬂine sources,” whereas ER
mainly focuses on news articles through RSS feeds. Thus,
having more sources might be the reason why GDELT in-
dexes much more documents than ER.

However, we ﬁnd that 99.9% of the documents are col-
lected from the web, and only less than 1,000 documents
in each day are from other ofﬂine sources. Moreover, all
the documents that are not from the web are collected from
BBC Monitoring, which monitors mass media worldwide,
and no other individual source is found. That is, the primary
data source for both platforms is the web, although GDELT
claims that they collect documents from various sources.
Also, the signiﬁcant difference in the number of indexed ar-
ticles between the two platforms is solely based on the dif-
ference in the news coverage of different sources.

Language
We look into account the language of the indexed articles
to compare the coverage of the two datasets. We ﬁnd that
the GDELT indexes documents written in 64.1 different lan-
guages on average (across 10 different sample datasets),
whereas ER indexes articles of only 14 languages. For both

platforms, the most dominant language is English. Given
that GDELT covers more languages, the proportion of En-
glish articles in GDELT (2,415,060 articles, 40.6%) is natu-
rally lower than in ER (765,637 articles, 51.8%).

Then, what other languages do they index? Table 1 shows
the top 10 languages in both platforms. While there are some
differences in rankings, the 10 languages are the same. In-
terestingly, they are not the same as the top 10 languages by
the number of native speakers6, total speakers7, nor Internet
web pages8.

News Sources
Next, we count the number of unique news sources (website
domains) for each language and compute the correlation be-
tween this source and the number of documents written in
each language. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant positive Spearman cor-
relation coefﬁcient for GDELT (ρ=.91, p < .0001) and ER
(ρ=.94, p < .0001). This high correlation is trivial because
more news sites naturally lead to more news articles to in-
dex.

We look into the unique domains in each dataset. Among
20,754 domains in ER and 63,268 domains in GDELT,
13,867 domains are common. We examine whether any pat-
tern exists among the common domains. We ﬁrst rank the
domains by the number of articles that are published in each

7https://goo.gl/VNBTcZ
8https://goo.gl/c7Xm6l

of them. We then compute how the proportion of common
domains between two platforms change from the top 10%
of domains (leftmost bar in Figure 2) to the bottom 10% of
domains (rightmost bar in Figure 2).

Figure 2: Proportion of common domains according to its
rank

Figure 2 shows the proportion of common domains be-
tween the two platforms according to normalized rank. In
GDELT, we see a clear pattern that a more active domain is
likely to be common, and a less active domain tends to be
found only in GDELT. However, in ER, this pattern is weak.
The pattern holds only up to the top 40%, but the proportion
of common domains does not vary much after that point.
Moreover, it is surprising that ER does not index 40.3% of
the top 10% of domains in GDELT. More than a half of top
10% to 20% of domains in GDELT are not indexed by ER.
On the other hand, GDELT covers more of ER’s domains.
Notably, 13.4% of the top 10% of domains in ER and 21.5%
of the top 10% to 20% of domains in ER are not indexed by
GDELT. This ﬁnding shows that, even though the number of
unique websites indexed by ER is one-third of those indexed
by GDELT, ER is not a simple subset of the top websites of
GDELT. Rather, both platforms have unique sets of news
sources independently, while having some common news
sources. So it is likely that news coverage research based on
each platform might show somewhat different results. Thus,
studies are required to characterize the differences between
news sites indexed by both platforms and ﬁnd a way to ad-
dress them.

We further examine the top sources (domains) of two
datasets. Table 2 reports the top 10 ranked list of news
sources in GDELT and 3 reports that in ER. Firstly, we see
that there is no overlap between the two lists. Then, we ﬁnd
the few, top news sources have an extremely large number of
articles in the two datasets compared to other sources. The
average number of articles per source is 89.97 in GDELT
and 67.60 in ER, and the median is 4 in GDELT and 6 in
ER. Compared to these values, the top 10 biggest sources in
Table 2 and 3 are extreme.

Figure 3 shows the dominant proportion of the top
sources. News articles from the top 10% of sources account
for 77.5% of the whole set of collected articles in ER and
79.2% of those in GDELT. This ﬁnding warns researchers to
design experiments to see news coverage and interpret the
result when using either of the two datasets. In contrast to of-

Figure 3: Proportion of articles from top x% of sources

ﬂine news media that have limited resources (e.g., one-hour
broadcasting news or 12” × 23” paper size of a newspaper)
for publishing news, online news media have no physical
limitations, and it costs less than print to publish news arti-
cles. This means that the number of news articles published
by online news media might have less signiﬁcant meaning
compared to ofﬂine news media. Therefore, it requires a
careful normalization when taking into account the number
of articles published by each news source. Otherwise, the
core measure in news coverage studies, “how many articles
report a target incident,” could be biased by the behaviors of
the dominant news media sources.

Again, an appropriate normalization technique should be
carefully selected. In our case, the market share of each news
medium, which indicates its reach to an audience, is typ-
ically considered as one of the prominent factors to infer
its importance. None of these platforms offer such metrics.
While ER is supposed to provide a ﬁeld of “importance” in
the source, its value is currently set to zero equally for all the
news sources.

As a preliminary guideline, we test the method to infer the
importance of each website based on its trafﬁc, as used in the
study by (Kwak and An 2014). We collect trafﬁc informa-
tion from the top 100 media sites in GDELT and ER from
Alexa.com. Alexa shows the global rank of each website
based on its trafﬁc. We compute the Spearman correlation
coefﬁcients between the global rank of Alexa and the rank
in both platforms. We ﬁnd almost no correlation in GDELT
(ρ=-.009) and an insigniﬁcant, weak positive correlation in
ER (ρ=.17, p=.10). This ﬁnding suggests that the number of
articles published by a source should not be used as a proxy
for its important or reach to an audience.
News Geography
News geography is the extent to which countries are reported
in the news internationally (Sreberny-Mohammadi 1984).
Typically, the number of news articles mentioning a country
is used as a measure of the news geography. The measure
shows the selection bias by journalists, and it is widely used
for research on foreign news coverage (Wilke, Heimprecht,
and Cohen 2012; Kwak and An 2014).

GDELT extracts all the locations from the text and stores
them in the “V2ENHANCEDLOCATIONS” ﬁeld. Simi-
larly, ER extracts all the concepts from the text and adds
metadata to each concept. We extract concepts that have a
valid value in the “location” and “country” ﬁelds.

the territory of a country is proportional to the number of
articles mentioning the country. We observe that the United
States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain are overrep-
resented compared to their original territory. That is, ER
contains more news articles mentioning events happening in
those countries. The news geography of GDELT is similar,
as we see in Figure 4 but China and Russia are represented
more. We have omitted them due to lack of space.

We can then measure the similarity between the news ge-
ography of both datasets by using corr(N GE, N GG). We
ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly high correlation between the news ge-
ographies of ER and GDELT (ρ=0.867, p=1.896e-74).

This ﬁnding is particularly surprising. In the previous sec-
tion, we observe that the news sources indexed by both
datasets are largely different, but what they regard as news
are similar in terms of where an event happens. Our ﬁnding
is adding up another evidence that journalists have a concept
of “world hierarchy” (Chang 1998) in determining which is
more important foreign news.

Summary and Discussion

In this work, we compared two publicly available datasets
on world news in terms of scale, news sources, and news ge-
ography. We found signiﬁcant differences in scale and news
sources, but they are similar in news geography.

We found that GDELT collects 2.26 times to 6.43 times
more documents than ER does per day. GDELT indexes
documents in 64.1 different languages per day on average,
whereas ER indexes documents in 14 languages. The top 10
languages in both datasets are the same, with only subtle dif-
ferences in ranking. However, these top 10 languages are not
the same as those by the number of total speakers nor those
by the language commonly used on the Internet.

We also discovered that GDELT indexes documents from
63,268 websites, and ER from 20,754 websites. Among
them, 13,867 websites are common. We observe a trend that
the websites with the biggest number of published docu-
ments are likely to be common, but at the same time, each
dataset has a lot of unique websites publishing many docu-
ments.

The number of articles from a news source varies greatly
across the sources. The top 10% of news sources publish
about 80% of news articles, collected in both datasets. Also,
we ﬁnd that the number of documents from a source does not
correlate with the web trafﬁc of the corresponding source.

Finally, in spite of all the differences between the two
datasets, we found that news geography obtained from both
datasets are quite similar.

What we learned from this study is that we should care-
fully use GDELT and ER for research because the two
datasets are quite different in terms of scale and news
sources. It is essential for researchers to understand the data
accurately prior to a deeper analysis of either dataset. This
also encourages the sharing of the dataset (or, a set of docu-
ment identiﬁers, at least) used in research.

Another practical consideration for research using both
datasets is accessibility. In contrast to GDELT, which allows
researchers to download the compressed raw ﬁles, ER pro-
vides the API with a rate limit. Even though we tried to max-
imize the size of the response, it took a few days to collect
the articles used in this study.

For future research, we would collect additional informa-
tion about news sources and propose a method to use both
datasets together, considering the importance of each news
source.
