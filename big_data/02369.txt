Using the variational cluster approximation (VCA) and the cluster perturbation theory, we study
the ﬁnite temperature phase diagram of a half-depleted periodic Anderson model on the honeycomb
lattice at half ﬁlling for a model of graphone, i.e., single-side hydrogenated graphene. The ground
state of this model is found to be ferromagnetic (FM) semi-metal. The origin of this FM state is
attributed to the instability of a ﬂat band located at the Fermi energy in the noninteracting limit
and is smoothly connected to the Lieb-Mattis type ferromagnetism. The spin wave dispersion in the
FM state is linear in momentum at zero temperature but becomes quadratic at ﬁnite temperatures,
implying that the FM state is fragile against thermal ﬂuctuations. Indeed, our VCA calculations
ﬁnd that the paramagnetic (PM) state dominates the ﬁnite temperature phase diagram. More sur-
prisingly, we ﬁnd that massless Dirac quasiparticles with the linear energy dispersion emerge at the
Fermi energy upon introducing the electron correlation U at the impurity sites in the PM phase.
The Dirac Fermi velocity is found to be highly correlated to the quasiparticle weight of the emer-
gent massless Dirac quasiparticles at the Fermi energy and monotonically increases with U . These
unexpected massless Dirac quasiparticles are also examined with the Hubbard-I approximation and
the origin is discussed in terms of the spectral weight redistribution involving a large energy scale of
U . Considering an eﬀective quasiparticle Hamiltonian which reproduces the single-particle excita-
tions obtained by the Hubbard-I approximation, we argue that the massless Dirac quasiparticles are
protected by the electron correlation. Our ﬁnding is therefore the ﬁrst example of the emergence of
massless Dirac quasiparticles due to dynamical electron correlations without breaking any spatial
symmetry. The experimental implications of our results for graphone as well as a graphene sheet
on transition metal substrates are also brieﬂy discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Graphene [1] has been one of the most actively studied
research subjects in current condensed matter physics [2].
Although its unique electronic property is characterized
already in a single-particle level, namely, with the linear
electronic energy dispersion, i.e., the Dirac cone disper-
sion, at the Fermi energy (EF) [3], many-body eﬀects
on graphene have also attracted much attention [4]. For
example, tremendous eﬀorts have been devoted on in-
vestigating whether a spin liquid state can exist in the
half-ﬁlled Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice [5–7],
one of the simplest models for graphene, and the nature
of metal-insulator transition [8, 9].

e.g.,

a

series

The research has been also extended to graphene
derived systems,
of hydrogenated
graphene [10–13]. A ﬁrst-principles calculation based
on density functional theory (DFT) has predicted that
the single-side hydrogenated graphene, called graphone,
becomes a ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductor with a
small indirect gap [14]. Other DFT based study has
suggested that the single-side hydrogenated and ﬂuori-

nated graphenes are both candidates for quantum spin
liquid [15]. Possible increase of the spin-orbit cou-
pling due to the sp3 lattice distortion has been also dis-
cussed [16, 17].

Many-body eﬀects on the hydrogenated graphene,
however, have not been explored so far. On the one hand,
the isolated graphene, described by, e.g., the single-band
Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice [18], remains
semi-metallic even when a moderate amount of electron
interactions are introduced before the antiferromagnetic
instability sets in [5–7, 19], and thus the correlation ef-
fect in semi-metallic phase is merely renormalization [9].
On the other hand, the electron correlation in the hy-
drogen atoms should be treated in a many-body way,
as suggested in the Heitler-London description for the
chemical bonding of a hydrogen molecule [20]. It is also
noteworthy that many-body eﬀects on hydrogen atoms in
metal can induce a Kondo-like eﬀect and make a drastic
correction in the single-particle excitation spectrum as
compared with that obtained by DFT calculations [21].

Here, we employ the variational cluster approxima-
tion (VCA) [22] and the cluster perturbation theory

(CPT) [23] to investigate many-body eﬀects on graphone
by considering a half-depleted periodic Anderson model
on the honeycomb lattice at half ﬁlling. We ﬁnd that the
ground state of this model is FM semi-metallic. The FM
state is attributed to the instability of a ﬂat band located
at EF in the noninteracting limit and smoothly connected
to the Lieb-Mattis type ferromagnetism. The liner spin
wave analysis of an eﬀective spin model for the periodic
Anderson model in the strong coupling limit ﬁnds that
the spin wave excitations in the FM state exhibits the lin-
ear dispersion in momentum at zero temperature, while
the spin wave dispersion becomes quadratic at ﬁnite tem-
peratures, implying that the FM state is fragile against
thermal ﬂuctuations and can be stable only at zero tem-
perature.

Our VCA calculations indeed ﬁnd that the ﬁnite tem-
perature phase diagram is dominated by a paramagnetic
(PM) state. Most signiﬁcantly, we ﬁnd that massless
Dirac quasiparticles emerge at EF upon introducing the
electron correlation in the PM phase. The Dirac Fermi
velocity of the emergent massless Dirac quasiparticles is
found to be highly correlated to the quasiparticle weight
at the Fermi energy and increase monotonically with the
electron correlation. We show that the emergence of the
massless Dirac quasiparticles is well captured by the sim-
ple Hubbard-I approximation and can be understood as
the result of the spectral weight redistribution involv-
ing a large energy scale of the electron correlation. By
considering an eﬀective Hamiltonian for the quasiparti-
cles, we discuss the chiral symmetry of the single-particle
excitations in the PM phase within the Hubbard-I ap-
proximation and argue that the emergent massless Dirac
quasiparticles are protected by the electron correlation.
The massless Dirac quasiparticles found here in the PM
phase are therefore in sharp contrast to massless Dirac
dispersions generated by band engineering with breaking
a crystalline symmetry, and represent the ﬁrst example
of the emergence of massless Dirac quasiparticles induced
by dynamical electron correlations.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec. II in-
troduces the periodic Anderson model studied here and
explains brieﬂy the numerical methods, i.e., the VCA
and the CPT. These numerical methods are employed
to obtain the ﬁnite temperature phase diagram and ex-
amine the single-particle excitations in Sec. III. The re-
sults are compared with those obtained analytically us-
ing the mean-ﬁeld theory in Sec. IV A and the Hubbard-
I approximation in Sec. IV B. An eﬀective Hamiltonian
for the quasiparticles is constructed on the basis of the
Hubbard-I approximate analysis and the chiral symmetry
of the quasiparticle excitations is discussed in Sec. IV C.
The implications of our results for experiments are also
brieﬂy discussed in Sec. V before summarizing the paper
in Sec. VI.

In addition, ﬁve appendices are provided to supple-
ment the main text. The stability of the FM state is ex-
amined with the liner spin wave theory in Appendix A.
Lieb’s theorem is applied to the periodic Anderson model

in Appendix B. This analysis, together with the numeri-
cally exact diagonalization study of small clusters in Ap-
pendix C, reveals that the FM ground state found here
is smoothly connected to the Lieb-Mattis type ferromag-
netism. The single-particle excitations for several limit-
ing cases are also examined within the Hubbard-I approx-
imation in Appendix D. Finally, the Brillouin-Wigner
perturbation theory is applied to the eﬀective quasipar-
ticle Hamiltonian in Appendix E.

II. MODEL AND METHODS

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce a periodic Ander-
son model as one of the simplest models for graphone,
i.e., single-side hydrogenated graphene, and summarize
the electron band structure of this model in the nonin-
teracting limit. Next, we brieﬂy explain the ﬁnite tem-
perature VCA and CPT to treat the electron correlation
eﬀect on the ﬁnite temperature phase diagram and the
single-particle excitations beyond the single-particle ap-
proximation.

is denoted by tsp, where each hydrogen impurity site is
linked only with the carbon site on B sublattice, as shown
in Fig. 1. The on-site potential energy and the on-site
Coulomb repulsion at the hydrogen impurity sites are de-
noted by H and U , respectively.

sp, appear near K and K(cid:48) points, and
(iii) in addition there exists the ﬂat band at EF, i.e.,
Ek = 0, which is composed of A and H orbitals (solely
of A orbital at K and K(cid:48) points), but not B orbital. Note
also that the ﬂat band is exactly half-ﬁlled at n = 1.

The periodic Anderson model H described in Eq. (1)
is the simplest model for graphone, implicitly assuming
that the hopping integral t in the conduction band should
be considered as the renormalized one due to the electron
correlation in the carbon sites. In the following, we set
the electron density n to be one for any U at all tem-
peratures by imposing the particle-hole symmetry with
H = −U/2, and thus the local electron density in each
site is exactly one. We also set a =  = kB = 1.

drogen orbitals around K and K(cid:48) points [14, 15].

C. Variational cluster approximation

Hh(cid:48) = h(cid:48)(cid:88)

We employ the VCA [22] to investigate a possible sym-
metry broken magnetic ordered state. Here, we intro-
duce, as a variational parameter, a uniform ﬁeld h(cid:48) on
the hydrogen impurity sites [25] described as
(nri↑H − nri↓H ) .

(5)
The reference system Href considered is thus composed of
Hh(cid:48) and a collection of disconnected ﬁnite size clusters,
as shown in Fig. 2 (a), where each cluster is described
by H but with no hopping terms between clusters, the
corresponding Hamiltonian being denoted as Hc. Hence,
the reference system is described as Href = Hc + Hh(cid:48).
The VCA evaluates as a function of h(cid:48) the grand po-

σ(z) of the single cluster is obtained within the
VCA, as described above. Note here that the momen-
tum k and the complex frequency z can take any values.
Therefore, we can achieve arbitrarily ﬁne resolution of k
and z for the single-particle excitations, which allows us
for the detailed analysis of the spectral properties includ-
ing the spectral weight and the Dirac Fermi velocity.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, we ﬁrst discuss the ﬁnite temperature
phase diagram of the periodic Anderson model obtained
by the VCA. Next, we examine in details the single-
particle excitations in each phase of the phase diagram
using the CPT.

A. Phase diagram

is exactly one, where (cid:104)···(cid:105) implies the thermal average.
Thus, strictly speaking, the ground state is ferrimag-
netic [26]. As discussed above in Sec. II B, in the nonin-
teracting limit with U = 0, the ﬂat band exists exactly
at EF and is half-ﬁlled [see Fig. 2(a)]. Therefore, the
system is unstable against FM order upon introducing
U . We assign the origin of this FM state to be ﬂat-band
ferromagnetism [27]. It should be also noted that, in the
strong coupling limit where an electron in each hydro-
gen impurity site is completely localized, the Ruderman-
Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interaction [28] between
these localized spins is FM [29] (see also Appendix A 1),
which naturally induces the FM ground state.

As discussed in Appendix B, Lieb’s theorem itself [24]
does not guarantee the uniqueness of the ground state
of H. This is simply because there is no on-site interac-
tion UC for the carbon conduction sites in H. However,
numerically exactly diagonalizing small clusters, we ﬁnd
in Appendix C that in the parameter region studied here
the ground state for UC (cid:54)= 0 is smoothly connected to the
non-degenerate ground state for UC = 0 (apart from the
trivial spin degeneracy), implying that the ground state
of H is the Lieb-Mattis type ferromagnetism on a bipar-
tite lattice with total spin S = (|A| + |H| − |B|)/2 [30].
With increasing the temperature, however, the FM
state is thermally destroyed and a PM state becomes sta-
ble. Notice here that the ﬁnite FM critical temperature

5

Here, ω is the real frequency and η is real positive in-
ﬁnitesimal for Lorentzian broadening of the spectrum.

1. FM ground state

Figure 4 shows the typical results of the single-particle
excitation spectrum in the FM ground state for U/t = 4
at T = 0. The enlarged spectrum close to the Fermi en-
ergy EF around K point is also shown in Fig. 5. It is
clearly observed in Fig. 5 that (i) the low-energy single-
particle excitations around EF display the quadratic en-
ergy dispersion in momentum, indicating massive quasi-
particle excitations, and (ii) the lowest single-particle ex-
citations around K point (and also K(cid:48) point) are com-
posed mostly of A orbital (the lowest excitations at K
and K(cid:48) points are solely due to A orbital and their spec-
tral weights are independent of U ). The latter is the
remnant to the noninteracting case shown in Fig. 2(b).

It is also noticeable in Fig. 4 that (iii) the lowest single-
particle excitations among the same spin have a ﬁnite gap
∆c, suggesting that the spin conserved charge excitations
are gapped, while (iv) the spin excitation gap should be
zero since the lowest single-particle excitation gap ∆s
among the opposite spins is zero, as shown in Fig. 5.
We also examine the U dependence of the single-particle
excitation spectrum and ﬁnd that (v) although ∆c (∆s)
monotonically increases (remains zero) with increasing
U , the eﬀective mass m∗ simply deceases, where m∗ is in-
versely proportional to the curvature of the quadratic en-
ergy dispersion for the lowest single-particle excitations.
As discussed in Sec. IV A, these features (i)–(v) can be
understood within a simple mean-ﬁeld theory.

2. PM state

In sharp contrast to the results for the FM state, we
ﬁnd that the PM state exhibits the linear energy dis-
persions near EF. As shown in Fig. 6 for U/t = 4, we
can clearly observe that the massless Dirac quasiparti-
cle excitations emerge with the Dirac point exactly at
EF. The U dependence of the single-particle excitations
for the PM state is summarized in Fig. 7. The massless
Dirac quasiparticle excitations always exist in the PM
state as long as U is ﬁnite. It is also interesting to notice
in Fig. 7 that the Dirac Fermi velocity vF, i.e., the slope
of the linear energy dispersion at EF, monotonically in-
creases with increasing U and approaches to the Dirac
Fermi velocity v0 =
3t/2 of the pure graphene model
in the limit of U/t → ∞ (see also Fig. 8).

√

While the simplest mean-ﬁeld theory and the DFT cal-
culations can reproduce qualitatively the FM state with
the quadratic energy dispersion, they fail to capture the
Dirac-like quasiparticle excitations with the linear energy
dispersion in the PM state [14]. The inability of describ-
ing the massless Dirac quasiparticles in the single-particle
approximations immediately implies that the dynamical

6-site and 9-site clusters with tsp/t = 1 at n = 1. PM-L (FM-
Q) stands for a PM (FM) phase with the linear (quadratic)
quasiparticle dispersion around EF.
In the noninteracting
limit with U = 0, the ﬂat band appears at EF (red solid line).
The FM state is stable in a blue (orange) shaded region below
a solid (dashed) line for the 9-site (6-site) cluster.

TC found in the VCA is due to a mean-ﬁeld like treat-
ment of the electron correlation beyond the size of clus-
ters. Indeed, increasing the size of a cluster from 6 sites
to 9 sites, we ﬁnd that TC decreases for all values of U/t,
as shown in Fig. 3. In Appendix A, we also analyze with
the linear spin wave theory an eﬀective spin Hamiltonian
for the periodic Anderson model in the strong coupling
limit, and ﬁnd that the spin wave dispersion Ωq with mo-
mentum q around Γ point is proportional to |q| at T = 0
but |q|2 at ﬁnite temperatures (see Fig. 19 and 20), im-
plying that the FM order is stable only at T = 0, as is
expected from Mermin-Wagner theorem [31] Therefore,
the ﬁnite TC obtained in the VCA should be regarded as
a temperature where the short range FM correlations are
developed over the size of a cluster, and the ﬁnite tem-
perature phase diagram is dominated by the PM phase.
As shown below, it is more surprising to ﬁnd in the
PM phase that massless Dirac quasiparticles emerge at
K and K(cid:48) points with the Dirac points exactly at EF.

exactly at EF and the same characteristic features of their
spectral weights. Although the emergent massless Dirac
quasiparticles are not clear for the 12-site calculations
shown in the bottom panels of Fig. 9, it is indeed ap-
parent in the enlarged scale near EF shown in Fig. 10.
Therefore, the emergence of the massless Dirac quasi-
particles is not subjected to the ﬁnite size eﬀects of the
clusters.

On the other hand, we ﬁnd in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 that
the Dirac Fermi velocity vF depends quantitatively on
the cluster size used. The U dependence of vF for three
diﬀerent clusters is summarized in Fig. 8. Although the
value itself depends on the cluster size, the qualitative
behavior of vF is the same: vF monotonically increases
with increasing U for all clusters used. It is also inter-
esting to note that, irrespectively of the cluster sizes, the
spectral weight ρBB
K for B orbital at the Dirac point is
found to be proportional to v2

as shown in Fig. 11. This universal behavior is intu-
itively understood by assuming that the electron annihi-
lation operator is renormalized with the renormalization
factor zA (zB) for A (B) orbital at the Dirac point kF,
i.e., ckFσA(B) → zA(B)ckFσA(B) with zA ≈ 1. Due to this

renormalization, ρBB
t is renormalized to tzAzB. The simple and yet signiﬁ-
cant universal relation in Eq. (12) concisely expresses the
inevitable involvement of B orbital in the low-energy ex-
citations for the emergent massless Dirac quasiparticles.
Finally, we summarize how the massless Dirac quasi-
particles emerge and evolve with increasing U and how
diﬀerent orbitals contribute to the formation of the mass-
less Dirac quasiparticles. As shown in Fig. 7, the spectral
weight ABB
σ (k, ω) for B orbital around the Fermi energy
is exactly zero when U = 0 since B orbital does not
contribute to the ﬂat band formation in the noninteract-
ing limit (see also Fig. 2). However, with increasing U ,
σ (k, ω) around K and K(cid:48) points near the Fermi en-
ABB
ergy gradually increases to form the massless Dirac quasi-
particles. On the other hand, the A orbital component of
the spectral weight AAA
σ (k, ω) at the Fermi energy is al-
ready ﬁnite even when U = 0, since A orbital contributes
to the formation of the ﬂat band in the noninteracting
limit, and as U increases it develops into the low energy
excitations with the linear energy dispersions at K and
K(cid:48) points. As shown in Sec. IV B, these features are in
good agreement with those obtained in the Hubbard-I
approximation.

The contribution of H orbital is diﬀerent. First, we
notice in Fig. 7 that the spectral weight AHH
(k, ω) for H
orbital displays almost dispersionless spectra, indicating
that H orbital is rather localized in real space, even when
U is small. Furthermore, as clearly observed in Fig. 7
and Fig. 9, AHH
(k, ω) exhibits a “dark spectral” region
where no spectral intensity exists and the “dispersion” of
the dark spectral region very much resembles the energy

correlation eﬀect is responsible for the emergent massless
Dirac quasiparticles, which will be discussed more.

We should also notice in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 that the
emergent massless Dirac quasiparticles are composed of
A and B orbitals, but not H orbital: while the contribu-
tion of A (H) orbital to the low energy spectral weight
near K point (and also K(cid:48) point) remains large (van-
ishing) with varying U , the contribution of B orbital is
small but ﬁnite for small U and gradually increases as
the massless Dirac quasiparticles becomes more visible
in the single-particle excitation spectrum for large U .

To be more quantitative, we also evaluate the spectral

weight for α orbital at the Dirac point with ω = 0,

K increases monotonically

understood by recalling that in the noninteracting limit,
A orbital is completely decoupled from H orbital at K
and K(cid:48) points where γk = 0 [see Eq. (3)]. Therefore,
even when the interaction U on the hydrogen impurity
sites is turned on, the contribution from A orbital to the
spectral weight at K and K(cid:48) points remains the same.
We also examine the ﬁnite size eﬀects on the single-
particle excitations in the PM state using three diﬀerent
clusters and ﬁnd no qualitative diﬀerence. Namely, as
shown in Fig. 9, we still ﬁnd the emergent massless Dirac
quasiparticles at K and K(cid:48) points with the Dirac points

This is exactly the case for the Hubbard-I approximation,

orbital is “level repulsive”, i.e., dynamically decoupled

and thus H orbital does not contribute to the formation
of the emergent massless Dirac quasiparticles.

IV. ANALYTICAL RESULTS

In this section, the periodic Anderson model is ana-
lyzed using the simplest mean-ﬁled theory for the FM
state and the Hubbard-I approximation for the PM state.
We also construct an eﬀective Hamiltonian to describe
the single-particle excitations in the PM state and dis-
cuss the chiral symmetry of the quasiparticles as well as
the origin of the emergent massless Dirac quasiparticles.

A. Mean-ﬁeld approximation

of the single-particle excitations obtained by the CPT
in Sec. III B 1 can be reproduced by the single-particle
approximation. Applying the mean-ﬁeld decoupling to
the on-site Coulomb term for the hydrogen impurity sites,

son model with H = −U/2 is given as

Assuming the FM ansatz, i.e.,

∆↑ = −∆↓ = ∆,

(17)

We ﬁrst consider the simplest mean-ﬁeld theory for the
FM state to show that the main characteristic features

we can easily obtain the single-particle excitation spec-
trum of HMF for a given ∆. A typical example of the

FIG. 10. (color online) Same as Fig. 9 but the enlarged scale at the vicinity of K point near the Fermi energy EF (white lines).
A Lorentzian broadening of η/t = 0.01 is used. The region of momenta taken in the horizontal axis is 0.2π in the K-M (K-Γ)
direction from K.

single-particle excitation spectrum for the FM state is
shown in Fig. 12. The main features are summarized as
follows. First, for any tsp and ∆ > 0, the Fermi energy
locates at the top (bottom) of the middle band for up
(down) electrons, thus indicating that the total magnetic
moment 2S is exactly |H|+|A|−|B|, independently of the
value of ∆ (> 0). Second, the top of the middle band for
up electrons and the bottom of the middle band for down
electrons touch exactly at the Fermi energy and momen-
tum k = K and K(cid:48). This degeneracy is easily understood
because γk = 0 at K and K(cid:48) points, and therefore one of
the eigenvalues of 3× 3 matrices in Eq. (15) for each spin
component must be zero at these momenta. This also in-
dicates that the energy dispersion is quadratic near the
Fermi energy. It should be also noticed in Fig. 12 that
the low-energy excitations close to the Fermi energy is
mostly composed of A orbital and indeed only A orbital
contributes to the spectral weight at the Fermi energy.
These results are qualitatively the same as those obtained
using the CPT in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.

B. Hubbard-I approximation

It is highly interesting to examine the single-particle
excitations in the PM state using the Hubbard-I approx-
imation [32] since this is the simplest approximation to

cluster (containing 4 unit cells) at T = 0 where the PM state

of U/t → ∞. Therefore, vF calculated by the Hubbard-I

obtained by the CPT.

in
the Hubbard-I approximation is thus evaluated using
Eq. (29) with the excitation energy dispersions ων,k in
Eq. (22) and the spectral weights ρν,k in Eqs. (31) and
(32). The excitation energy dispersions ων,k and the
spectral weights ρν,k for several limiting cases are studied
in Appendix D. Among these limiting cases, it is rather
interesting to note that the single-particle excitations in
the strong coupling limit with U → ∞ are exactly the
same as those in the decoupling limit with tsp → 0, i.e.,
both showing the massless Dirac energy dispersion with
the Dirac Fermi velocity v0.

where Na is the number of unit cells and no magnetic
order is assumed in the last equation. Figure 14 shows
the evolution of Dα(ω) obtained within the Hubbard-
I approximation.
It is clearly observed in Fig. 14 that
the signiﬁcant redistribution of the spectral weight occurs
with increasing U .

The characteristic features of the spectral weight redis-
tribution are summarized as follows. The ﬂat band which
appears in the noninteracting limit (see Sec. II B) causes
a delta function peak at ω = 0 in DA(ω) and DH (ω),
but not in DB(ω). However, once the Coulomb interac-
tion U is introduced, the ﬂat band in DA(ω) splits into
two bands around the Fermi energy to form a “Dirac
band” with the massless Dirac quasiparticle dispersion
(see Fig. 13 and also Fig. 16).
It is also noticed in

is the lower (upper) bound of the upper (lower) Hubbard
band at K and K(cid:48) points, is transferred to the low en-
ergy region to participate in the formation of the massless
Dirac quasiparticles. Simultaneously, the spectral weight
DB(ω) for B orbital in the low energy region |ω| < ∆c is
gradually transferred from the upper and lower Hubbard
bands located in the high energy region |ω| (cid:38) ∆c, and
the contribution of B orbital to the “Dirac band” be-
comes as signiﬁcant as that of A orbital for larger values
of U . Indeed, DA(ω) ≈ DB(ω) in the “Dirac band” for
|ω| < ∆c when U/t (cid:38) 5. On the other hand, as shown in
Figs. 14(b) and 14(c), the spectral weight DH (ω) for H
orbital loses its intensity in the low energy region near the
Fermi energy and the large spectral weights are piled up
in rather narrow high energy regions, exhibiting a typical
localized incoherent feature. This spectral weight redis-
tribution enhances the coherent hybridization between
A and B orbitals in the low energy region. Therefore,
the participation of B orbital together with the disen-
gagement of H orbital in the low energy excitations is
essential to form the massless Dirac quasiparticles near
the Fermi energy.

It is indeed noticed in Fig. 14(a) that DA(ω) and
DB(ω) both exhibit the linearly vanishing density of
states near the Fermi energy, a characteristic feature of
the massless Dirac dispersion. It is well known that the
Van Hove singularity appears in the DOS at ω = ±t, i.e.,

indicating that the low energy band for |ω| < ∆c can in

fact be regarded as an eﬀective pure graphene band with
the renormalized Dirac Fermi velocity vF.

As shown in Fig. 15(a), we also ﬁnd that the slope
of DB(ω) around the Fermi energy is independent of U/t
and is identical to that for the pure graphene model. The
density of states D0(ω) per orbital for the pure graphene
model is shown in Fig. 15(c) and can be evaluated as

6. Spectral weight at the Dirac points

Although the density of states Dα(ω) vanishes at ω =
0, the spectral weight ρν,k itself is ﬁnite even at ω =

0 for k = K and K(cid:48). Here, we derive the analytical
expression of the spectral weight at K point where the
massless Dirac dispersions emerge. Because γk=K = 0,
the spectral weight at K point is determined only by U
and tsp. Indeed, the poles of the single-particle Green’s
function in Eq. (22) are located at ω1/4,K = ±∆c and
ω2/3,K = 0. Therefore, from Eqs. (31) and (32), the
spectral weights ραα

From these analytical forms, we can ﬁnd several charac-

σ (K, ω) does not depend on U and it remains in the
same form as in the noninteracting case. Namely, it has a
single pole at zero energy (ω = 0) and its spectral weight
is one. Second, GBB
σ (K, ω) has a pole at ω = 0 with its
spectral weight proportional to the square of the Dirac

Fermi velocity vF, i.e.,

poles are located at ω = ±∆c and their spectral weights

spectral weight is transferred from the high energy poles

has no poles at ω = 0 for any ﬁnite value of U , but at
ω = ±∆c.

the calculation of the single-particle excitation spectrum
Aαα
σ (k, ω) is straightforward and the results for various
values of U are shown in Fig. 16. We can clearly ﬁnd
in Fig. 16 that (i) the ﬂat band which is present only
at U = 0 evolves into the Dirac band with the mass-
less Dirac dispersions emerging around K and K(cid:48) points
near the Fermi energy, (ii) the Dirac points are located
exactly at the Fermi level and momentum k = K and
K(cid:48), (iii) the contribution of B orbital to the Dirac band
becomes increasingly signiﬁcant with increasing U , while
H orbital does not participate in the formation of the
massless Dirac dispersion, and (iv) the highest and low-
est bands which display the massive Dirac dispersions

16

near K and K(cid:48) points at U = 0 evolve respectively into
the upper and lower Hubbard bands in the high energy
regions for |ω| (cid:38) ∆c. These characteristic features are in
good qualitative agreement with those obtained by the
CPT for the PM state shown in Fig. 7.

Although it is already convincing that the contribu-
tion of B orbital to the low energy excitations is essen-
tial for the emergent massless Dirac quasiparticles, here
we quantify the low energy bonding character between
A and B orbitals and examine how this quantity evolves
with increasing U within the Hubbard-I approximation.
For this purpose, let us deﬁne the following eﬀective dy-
namical bonding strength between A and B orbitals

†
σ |(cid:104)c
riσAcriσB + H.c.(cid:105)| if the lower bound of the
integral is extended to −∞. As shown in Fig. 17, we
ﬁnd that although TAB is almost constant and does not
depend strongly on U , LAB is rather sensitive to U and
monotonically increases from zero. This clearly demon-
strates that the low energy bonding between A and B
orbitals becomes stronger as the massless Dirac quasi-
particles develops with increasing U , which is accompa-
nied by the large spectral weight redistribution from the
upper and lower Hubbard bands to the Dirac band.

C. Chiral symmetry in single-particle excitations

It is well known in the single-particle theory that for
a bipartite system with no hopping between two diﬀer-
ent sites on the same sublattice, there exist zero-energy
states at least as many as the diﬀerence of the number
of sites on each sublattice [24, 33–35]. For example, the
ﬂat band found in the noninteracting limit of the pe-
riodic Anderson model H is a typical case because the
number of sites on each sublattice is diﬀerent (i.e., sub-
lattice imbalanced) by one per unit cell, thus leading to
at least one zero-energy state at each momentum, as dis-
cussed in Sec. II B. On the other hand, this theorem does
not predict the existence of the four Dirac cones with
eight zero-energy states in the pure graphene model (in-
cluding the spin degeneracy) as the pure graphene model
contains the same number of sites on each sublattice. In-
stead, the four Dirac cones at K and K(cid:48) points in the
pure graphene model are protected by the time-reversal
symmetry, 120◦-rotational symmetry, and sublattice (or,
equivalently, inversion) symmetry [36].

Here, we argue that the quasiparticle excitations in the
PM phase of the periodic Anderson model dynamically
recover the sublattice balance, thus eliminating a triv-
ial zero-energy state, and the Dirac cone like dispersions
with point contacts at zero energy is protected by the
electron correlation.

scribe the quasiparticles, not the bare electrons,
in
the Hubbard-I approximations. Here, the dynamical
electron correlation in the Hubbard-I approximation
is represented as the hybridization between the aux-
iliary orbital X and the hydrogen orbital H with the
hybridization strength U/2 (see Fig. 18). The Mott
gap between the upper and lower Hubbard bands in
the Hubbard-I approximation is then interpreted as a
single-particle hybridization gap generated by introduc-
ing X orbital. Indeed, we can show that the eigenvalues
of HH-I coincide with ων,k (ν = 1, 2, 3, and 4) in the
Hubbard-I approximation (see Sec. IV B 2). The similar
interpretation of the Mott gap is recently emphasized
by Sakai et al.
in the context of high-temperature
cuprate superconductors [37]. The analysis of the eﬀec-
tive Hamiltonian HH-I based on the Brillouin-Wigner
perturbation theory is given in Appendix E.

The spectral weight of the single-particle Green’s
function obtained by the Hubbard-I approximation in
Eq. (29) can also be reproduced from the eigenstates γ

cle in the Dirac equation, where the chiral symmetry is
preserved.
It is now easy to show that the “non-trivial” zero-
energy states exist only at K and K(cid:48) points for HH-I
as long as the electron correlation U is ﬁnite. Since tsp
and U are independent of k and γk = 0 only at K and
K(cid:48) points, we can readily ﬁnd that

rank Tk =

(k = K, K(cid:48))
(otherwise)

(64)

(cid:26) 2

provided that tsp and U are both ﬁnite. It is then imme-
diately followed that

rank Hk =

(k = K, K(cid:48))
(otherwise).

(65)

Equation (65) therefore guarantees the existence of two
zero-energy modes at K (K(cid:48)) point, which represent the
point contact of the single-particle excitations exactly at
Fermi energy. In other words, the ﬁnite electron correla-
tion U and the chiral symmetry of HH-I with Tr[Γ] = 0
permit the point contacts of the single-particle excita-
tions to appear only at K and K(cid:48) points. We should
note that the argument given here is a direct extension
of the pure graphene model [35] to the four orbital model
HH-I.

V. DISCUSSION

First, we should remark on the Hubbard-I approxima-
tion which has been repeatedly proved to successfully re-
produce qualitatively and sometimes quantitatively the
results obtained by the CPT for the PM state of the pe-
riodic Anderson model studied here. To understand the
success of the Hubbard-I approximation, we should re-
call that there exists the ﬂat band in the noninteracting
limit, which is exactly half-ﬁlled. This ﬂat band structure
prohibits any perturbative treatment of U since even a
small U should be regard as the strong correlation. This
explains why the Hubbard-I approximation, which is usu-
ally a good approximation in the atomic (i.e., strong cou-
pling) limit, gives the satisfactory results even for small
U .

Second, the emergent massless Dirac quasiparticles
found here should be sharply contrasted to the recently
discussed massless Dirac dispersion generated by band
engineering [38, 39]. Our ﬁnding diﬀers from the previ-
ous reports in the following aspects: (i) while the elec-
tron correlation induces the massless Dirac quasiparticles
in our case, breaking the spatial symmetry is essential to
generate the massless Dirac dispersion in the band engi-
neering, and (ii) the Dirac point appears exactly at the
Fermi energy in our case, but it is generally away from
the Fermi energy in the band engineered Dirac disper-
sion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst ex-
ample of the emergent massless Dirac quasiparticles due

FIG. 18. (color online) Schematic representations for (a) the
periodic Anderson model H in the noninteracting limit and
(b) the eﬀective Hamiltonian HH-I where the electron correla-
tion U is represented as the hybridization between H orbital
and auxiliary X orbital. Both models are deﬁned on bipar-
tite lattices with the hopping between diﬀerent sublattices,
and preserve the chiral symmetry. The A-B sublattice sym-
metry (the Hamiltonian is invariant under the exchange of A
and B orbitals) as in the pure graphene model is apparently
broken in both models. Although the sublattice balance is
also broken in model (a), i.e., |a| (cid:54)= |b|, it is preserved in
model (b) due to the presence of auxiliary X orbital.

where O (I) is a null (unit) matrix. Equations (60) and
(61) remind us the Dirac matrices in relativistic quantum
mechanics, although the Dirac matrices must be trace-
less, instead of Eq. (62). We can easily ﬁnd that for any
k

(cid:19)

(cid:18) I O

O −I

Γ =

(63)

is the matrix which deﬁnes the chiral symmetry of HH-I.
The Γ matrix is the matrix representation of chiral oper-
ator and represents the basis transformation, ˜ckσA(H) →
˜ckσA(H) and ˜ckσB(X) → −˜ckσB(X). Equation (60) or
equivalently ΓH kΓ−1 = −H k thus implies that HH-I
changes the sign by this transformation. Notice also that
Γ in Eq. (63) is a traceless matrix, i.e., Tr[Γ] = |a|−|b| =
0 in Eq. (62).
It should be recalled here that Tr[Γ] = |a| − |b| repre-
sents the diﬀerence of the number of sites belonging to
a and b sublattices, and gives the number of zero-energy
states, as ﬁrst pointed out by Lieb [24] (see also Ref. [34]).
Indeed, we can ﬁnd a 3 × 3 matrix Γ even for the peri-
odic Anderson model in the noninteracting limit, i.e., H0
in Eq. (3), which satisﬁes Eqs. (60)–(62), but its trace
is Tr[Γ] = |a| − |b| = 1. This immediately indicates the
presence of the ﬂat band due to the sublattice imbalance,
as already discussed in Sec. II B. The tracelessness of Γ
in Eq. (63) for HH-I thus implies that these trivial zero-
energy states are absent, which is similar to the cases of
the pure graphene model and also the relativistic parti-

Tr[Γ]=0 Tr[Γ]=0|a|=|A|+|H||b|=|B||a|=|A|+|H||b|=|B|+|X|ABHABHX(a)(b)H0HH-Ito dynamical electron correlations without breaking any
spatial symmetry.

Third, let us brieﬂy discuss the experimental implica-
tions of our results. We have studied the half-depleted
periodic Anderson model on the honeycomb lattice at
half ﬁlling, which can be considered as the simplest model
for the single-side hydrogenated graphene. Recently, Ray
et al. [12] reported a ferromagnetism in a partially hy-
drogenated graphene on the graphite substrate. Their
observation of the ferromagnetism is consistent with our
ground state calculations. Although Lieb’s theorem can
not directly applied to the periodic Anderson model stud-
ied here, we have shown in Sec. III A and Appendix C
that the FM ground state found in our calculations is
smoothly connected to the Lieb-Mattis type ferromag-
netism. Therefore, we attribute the ferromagnetism ob-
served experimentally to the Lieb-Mattis type ferromag-
netism.

Another possible experiment which is relevant to our
calculations is a graphene sheet on transition metal sub-
strates. Varykhalov et al. [40] reported angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments for
graphene deposited on Ni(111) and Co(0001) surfaces. In
these systems, the sublattice symmetry of graphene is ap-
parently broken. This is because the carbon atoms on B
sublattice of the graphene sheet locate on top of the tran-
sition metal atoms of the substrate, whereas the carbon
atoms on A sublattice are placed on top of the interstitial
sites of the transition metal atoms. Therefore, the car-
bon 2pz orbitals on B sublattice hybridize strongly with
the transition metal 3d orbitals, but the hybridization
between the carbon atoms on A sublattice and the tran-
sition metal atoms is rather weak. In spite of the broken
sublattice symmetry, they have observed in their ARPES
experiments the linearly dispersing single-particle excita-
tions with the Dirac point about 2.8 eV below the Fermi
energy [40]. The deviation of the Dirac point from the
Fermi energy might be understood simply as a conse-
quence of the electron transfer from the substrate. Since
the most simplest model for these systems is the half-
depleted periodic Anderson model studied here, their ob-
servation can be understood as the emergent massless
Dirac quasiparticles induced by the electron correlation
of transition metals. However, more detailed study is
highly desired for quantitative comparison.

this FM state is semi-metallic. We have discussed the rel-
evance of Lieb’s theorem to the periodic Anderson model,
and shown, with the help of numerically exactly diagonal-
izing small clusters, that the FM ground state found here
is smoothly connected to the Lieb-Mattis type ferromag-
netism. We have also shown in the strong coupling limit
that the FM state displays the linear spin wave disper-
sion at zero temperature, rather than the quadratic spin
wave dispersion often observed in the FM state. This is
simply because of the peculiar Dirac like electron energy
dispersion of the conduction band. However, we have
found that the spin wave dispersion becomes quadratic
at ﬁnite temperatures, thus implying that the FM state is
stable only at zero temperature, consistent with Mermin-
Wagner theorem.

Indeed, we have found using the VCA that the FM
state is fragile against thermal ﬂuctuations, and the ﬁ-
nite temperature phase diagram is dominated by the PM
phase. More surprisingly, our CPT calculations have re-
vealed that the massless Dirac quasiparticles emerge at K
and K(cid:48) points with the Dirac points exactly at the Fermi
energy, once the electron correlation U is introduced
in the PM state. This should be contrasted with the
quadratic quasiparticle dispersions in the FM phase. We
have shown that the emergent massless Dirac quasiparti-
cles in the PM phase can be reproduced in the Hubbard-I
approximation. Moreover, we have found that the for-
mation of the emergent massless Dirac quasiparticles is
accompanied with the spectral weight redistribution of
the single-particle excitations, involving a large energy
scale of U .
In fact, we have found in both CPT and
Hubbard-I approximation that the single-particle spec-
tral weight ρBB
K for B orbital at the Dirac point is pro-
portional to the square of the Dirac Fermi velocity vF,
K = (vF/v0)2, where vF is zero when U = 0
i.e., ρBB
and monotonically increases with U . This universal re-
lation expresses that the involvement of B orbital in the
low-energy excitations is essential for the formation of
the emergent massless Dirac quasiparticles. Construct-
ing the eﬀective quasiparticle Hamiltonian, we have ar-
gued that the Dirac cones with the point contacts at K
and K(cid:48) points are protected by the electron correlation
U . Our ﬁnding therefore represents the ﬁrst example of
the emergence of massless Dirac quasiparticles induced
by the electron correlation without breaking any spatial
symmetry.

VI. SUMMARY

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Using the VCA and the CPT, we have studied the ﬁ-
nite temperature phase diagram of the half-depleted pe-
riodic Anderson model at half-ﬁlling for a model of gra-
phone, i.e., the single-side hydrogenated graphene. We
have found that the ground state is FM as long as the
electron correlation U on the hydrogen impurity sites is
ﬁnite. Although the single-particle excitations with the
same spin are gapped, the quasiparticle dispersions with
the opposite spins touch at K and K(cid:48) points. Therefore,

The computations have been done using the RIKEN
Integrated Cluster of Clusters (RICC) facility and
RIKEN supercomputer system (HOKUSAI GreatWave).

Appendix A: Linear spin wave analysis for the FM

state in the strong coupling limit

In this Appendix, we consider the large U limit (i.e.,
Kondo limit), where a single electron is localized on each
hydrogen impurity site, forming a localized spin with spin
S = 1/2. Recall here that the local electron density is
always one at each site when the particle-hole symmetry
is preserved, i.e., H = −U/2.
In this limit, the peri-
odic Anderson model is mapped onto an eﬀective Kondo
lattice model described by the following Hamiltonian:

lyze the magnetic excitations within the liner spin wave
theory to discuss the stability of the FM state at ﬁnite

As shown in Fig. 19 (see also Fig. 20), we ﬁnd that the
spin wave dispersion Ωq is linear in the long wavelength
limit, i.e., |q| → 0, although the ground state is FM with
no quantum ﬂuctuations. The linearity of the spin wave
dispersion in the long wavelength limit is simply because
of the massless Dirac dispersion of the conduction elec-
trons, which induces the long range RKKY interaction.
This should be contrasted to the spin wave dispersion of
a FM Heisenberg model with a short range interaction,
where the spin wave dispersion in the long wavelength
limit is quadratic.

eﬀective spin Hamiltonian HRKKY obtained in the linear spin
wave approximation at zero temperature. Here JK is set to
be one as the energy unit. The black dots in the Ωq = 0 plane
indicate high symmetric momenta such as Γ, M , K, and K(cid:48)
[see Fig. 2(b)].

The linear dispersion around Γ point implies that the
contribution from the thermal excitations of the spin
wave is convergent even in two spatial dimensions. More
explicitly, the magnetization m(T ) at temperature T is
evaluated as

m(T ) = m(0) − ∆m(T ),

m(0) = 1/2 is the magnetic moment for the fully polar-
ized FM state at T = 0 and the long wavelength approx-
imation of the linear dispersion relation, i.e., Ωq (cid:39) c|q|,
for the spin wave dispersion is used. It is thus tempting
to conclude that the critical temperature TC for the FM
order is ﬁnite even in two dimensions and is proportional
to the magnon velocity c.

However, it should be reminded that the RKKY in-
teraction JR in Eq. (A13) itself is temperature depen-
dent and the temperature dependence of JR has to be
considered explicitly when the spin wave dispersion is
calculated at ﬁnite temperatures. The results of the ﬁ-
nite temperature spin wave dispersion is summarized in
Fig. 20. It is clearly found in Fig. 20 that the spin wave
dispersion Ωq is quadratic (Ωq ∝ |q|2) in the long wave-
length limit around Γ point at ﬁnite temperatures . It
is now readily shown that the q integral in ∆m(T ) given
in Eq. (A25) is proportional to ζ(1), which is divergent.
Therefore, we can conclude that a ﬁnite temperature FM
transition is impossible and TC should be zero.

3. Summary and remark on the FM state

Let us summarize the liner spin wave analysis for the
eﬀective spin Hamiltonian HRKKY and make a remark on
the ﬁnite FM transition temperature TC obtained by the
VCA for the periodic Anderson model H in Sec. III A.
Since the RKKY interaction is FM and long-ranged, i.e.,
JR ∝ |R|−3, at zero temperature [29], the ground state of
HRKKY is FM and the spin wave dispersion in the long
wavelength limit is linear (∼ |q|). However, this long
range character of the RKKY interaction is true only
at zero temperature and one can readily show that the
RKKY interaction becomes short-ranged at ﬁnite tem-
peratures. The resulting spin wave dispersion at ﬁnite
temperatures is quadratic in the long wavelength limit
(∼ |q|2), and therefore TC should be zero. After all,
the model studied here, the periodic Anderson model,
only includes short range interactions and thus Mermin-
Wagner theorem [31] guarantees that the FM instability
should occur only at zero temperature.

The ﬁnite TC found in the VCA for the periodic An-
derson model is due merely to a mean-ﬁled like treat-
ment of the electron correlation beyond the size of clus-
ters and should be regarded as a temperature where the
short range FM correlations are developed. Indeed, we
have found that TC decreases with increasing the size of
clusters (see Fig. 3). The considerably small TC found in
the VCA is due to the energy scale of the FM instability,
namely, the exchange splitting, ∼ U ((cid:104)nri↑H(cid:105) − (cid:104)nri↓H(cid:105)),
sp/U 2×
for small U and the RKKY interaction, ∼ t4
(static spin susceptibility of the conduction band), for
large U .

Appendix B: Application of Lieb’s theorem

In this Appendix, we consider a Hubbard model HHM
described by the same Hamiltonian for the half-depleted
periodic Anderson model H studied in the main text ex-
cept that now the on-site Coulomb repulsion UC on the

we analyze the ground state of this Hubbard model HHM
at half ﬁlling based on Lieb’s theorem on a bipartite lat-
tice [24].
Following Lieb’s argument in Ref. [24], we can show
that the ground state of HHM has the following proper-

there exists one state which has total spin S = 0, when
U ≤ 0 and UC ≤ 0 and (b) the ground state is unique if
U < 0 and UC < 0. The details of the proof are found in
Ref. [24]. Here, we only note that in the proof the matrix

(cid:12)(cid:12) ¯β(cid:11) deﬁned in Ref. [24] should be replaced

of real space conﬁgurations of electrons with spin σ.

Let us now map the Hubbard model HHM onto a neg-

where ¯nriσα = ¯c†
Applying Lieb’s theorem to the negative U Hub-
bard model ¯HHM, we can readily show that (i) the
ground state of HHM at half ﬁlling is unique (apart
from the trivial spin degeneracy) and it has total spin
S = (|H| + |A| − |B|) /2 when U > 0 and UC > 0 and
(ii) one of the possibly degenerate ground states of H
(i.e., HHM with UC = 0) at half ﬁlling has total spin
S = (|H| + |A| − |B|) /2 when U > 0.

To prove statement (i), we should ﬁrst notice that the
corresponding spin-1/2 Heisenberg model obtained in the
limit of U , UC → ∞ is deﬁned on the bipartite lattice and
thus Lieb-Mattis theorem guarantees the unique ground
state of this spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with total spin
S = (|H| + |A| − |B|) /2 [30]. Applying Lieb’s theorem
(b) to ¯HHM for U > 0 and UC > 0, we can now show
that the ground state of HHM is unique, apart from the
trivial degeneracy due to the spin rotational symmetry,
for any ﬁnite value of UC until UC → 0+ and the total
spin of the ground state is S = (|H| + |A| − |B|) /2 [41].
When UC is exactly zero, the uniqueness of the ground
state of HHM is no longer guaranteed. However, ac-
cording to Lieb’s theorem (a), the state with S =
(|H| + |A| − |B|) /2 must be the ground state or one of

24

the possibly degenerate ground states, which thus proves
statement (ii). In the next Appendix, we will show by
numerically exactly diagonalizing small clusters that in-
deed the ground state of H is unique and it has total spin
S = (|H| + |A| − |B|) /2 when U > 0.

Appendix C: Numerically exact diagonalization

study of the ground state phase diagram

Although Lieb’s theorem does not guarantee the
unique ground state of H at half ﬁlling, here we per-
form numerically exact diagonalization calculations for
small clusters to show that the ground state of HHM at
half ﬁlling for U, UC > 0 is smoothly connected to the
one even for UC approaching exactly to zero, namely, the
ground state of H at half ﬁlling is unique with its total
spin S = (|H| + |A| − |B|) /2.
Figure 21 shows the ground state phase diagrams for
HHM at hall ﬁlling obtained by numerically exactly di-
agonalizing the 12-site cluster (see Fig. 1) with peri-
odic and open boundary conditions. We ﬁnd for both
boundary conditions that the ground state for U > 0
and UC > 0 is indeed unique and it has total spin
S = (|H| + |A| − |B|) /2, in good accordance with Lieb’s
theorem. We also ﬁnd in Fig. 21 that the ground state for
U > 0 and UC > 0 is smoothly connected to the unique
ground state for UC = 0, where Lieb’s theorem does not
guarantee the uniqueness of the ground state. Therefore,
we conclude that the ground state of H at half ﬁlling is
unique and it has total spin S = (|H| + |A| − |B|) /2 as
long as U > 0. This also proves that the FM ground
state of H found in the main text is smoothly connected
to the Lieb-Mattis type ferromagnetism.

Appendix D: Single-particle excitations in the

Hubbard-I approximation

The analytical forms of the single-particle excitation
dispersion ων,k and the corresponding spectral weight
ρν,k obtained by the Hubbard-I approximation are pro-
vided in Eq. (22) and Eqs. (31) and (32), respectively.
Here, in this Appendix, we shall examine these quanti-
ties for several limiting cases.

given as

FIG. 21. (color online) The ground state phase diagrams of
HHM for tsp = t at half ﬁlling. The results are obtained
by numerically exactly diagonalizing the 12-site clusters, con-
taining 4 unit cells (see Fig 1), with (a) periodic boundary
conditions (PBC) and (b) open boundary conditions (OBC).
The total spin S of the ground state is indicated in the ﬁg-
ures. The ground state with S = 2 is found all unique. HHM
with UC = 0 (indicated by red dashed lines) corresponds to
the periodic Anderson model H studied in the min text.

These results are also obtained directly by solving
the noninteracting Hamiltonian H0.
It is apparent in
Eqs. (D2) and (D4) that the ﬂat band, corresponding to

the inner two bands with ν = 2 and 3, is composed solely
of A and H orbitals, but not B orbital, i.e., B orbital
being completely decoupled from the ﬂat band (see the

-2-1.6-1.2-0.8-0.400.40.8UC/t012345678U/t-2-1.6-1.2-0.8-0.400.40.8UC/tS=1S=2UC=0S=2S=0S=1S=0UC=0(a) PBC(b) OBCtop panels of Fig. 16).

4. Strong bonding limit

2. Localized spin limit

A single electron is localized on each hydrogen impu-
rity site when U is large enough, and eventually the hy-
drogen impurity sites are decoupled from the conduction
band in the limit of U → ∞. In this limit, the energy
dispersions are given as

lim

U→∞ ω1/4,k (cid:39) ± lim

U→∞ ω2/3,k = ±|γk|,

Thus, as expected, the hydrogen impurity sites are com-
pletely detached from the carbon conduction sites, form-
ing the upper and lower Hubbard band in the atomic
limit, which correspond to the outer two bands with
ν = 1 and 4, respectively. The inner two bands with
ν = 2 and 3 simply display the energy dispersion of the
conduction band, i.e., the massless Dirac dispersion for
the pure graphene model.

If |tsp| is large, it is expected that the bonding and anti-
bonding “molecular” orbitals are formed locally between
the neighboring B and H orbitals, and as a result A
orbital is isolated. In this limit, the energy dispersions
are given as

lim|tsp|→∞ ω1/4,k (cid:39) ± lim|tsp|→∞
lim|tsp|→∞ ω2/3,k = 0,

It is apparent from these results that B and H orbitals
are indeed tightly bound to form the bonding and anti-
bonding “molecular” orbitals and the isolated A orbitals
are completely localized.

Appendix E: Brillouin-Wigner perturbation theory

for the quasiparticle Hamiltonian HH-I

In this Appendix, we apply the Brillouin-Wigner (BW)
perturbation theory [42] to the quasiparticle Hamiltonian
HH-I in Eq. (52) and derive eﬀective Hamiltonians for the
Dirac band as well as for the upper and lower Hubbard
bands.

3. Decoupling limit

If tsp is zero, the hydrogen impurity sites are decou-
pled from the conduction band. In this limit, the energy
dispersions are give as

ω1/4,k = ± U

It is interesting to notice that these are exactly the same
as those in the limit of U → ∞.

Let us ﬁrst divide the 4 × 4 quasiparticle Hamiltonian
matrix H, deﬁning the quasiparticle Hamiltonian HH-I
in Eq. (52), into 2 × 2 submatrices, i.e.,

where A, B, C, and D are the corresponding 2 × 2 ma-
trices. Then, applying the BW perturbation theory, i.e.,
the energy dependent perturbation theory, the energy (ω)
dependent eﬀective Hamiltonian matrix H eﬀ (ω) is given
as

H eﬀ (ω) = P H

is the perturbation. Here, 0 represents the 2 × 2 null

target (i.e., eﬀective model) space and the space orthog-
onal to the target space, respectively, and they satisfy
that P 2 = P and P + Q = I, which lead to Q2 = Q and
P Q = 0.

2. Eﬀective Hamiltonian for the Dirac band

To obtain an eﬀective Hamiltonian projected onto the
carbon conduction sites, the projection matrices should
be

and

P = diag(1, 1, 0, 0)

Q = diag(0, 0, 1, 1).

Then the eﬀective Hamiltonian is given as

P (ω − H eﬀ (ω))P =

eﬀ,Gr(ω) 0
0

0

(cid:18) g−1

(E6)

(E7)

where, up to the second order of tsp, we obtain that

Notice that this is a Schur’s complement of ω − H with

of the target space is thus obtained as

heﬀ,Gr(ω) : = ω − g−1

 0

(E10)

From Eq. (E10), we ﬁnd that (i) when ω → 0 and
|U| > 0, the eﬀective Hamiltonian is the same as the
pure graphene model, and (ii) when U = 0, the eﬀec-
tive on-site energy of B orbital diverges in the limit of
ω → 0, implying that B orbital does not involve the ﬂat
band formation.

27

The eigenvalue problem of the target space in the BW

perturbation theory is described as

heﬀ,Gr(ω)ψeﬀ,Gr = ωψeﬀ,Gr,

(E11)

where ψeﬀ,Gr is the two dimensional eigenstate vector
and the eigenvalues are given as the roots of the secular
equation

det [ω − heﬀ,Gr(ω)] = det g−1

eﬀ,Gr(ω) = 0.

(E12)

Noticing that the determinant formula for the block ma-
trix

det H = det D · det(A − BD−1C),

(E13)

we ﬁnd that the eigenvalues are given as the roots of

det g−1

eﬀ,Gr(ω) =

det(ω − H)
det(ω − D)

= 0.

(E14)

Therefore, the eigenvalues are identical to those obtained
by the full eigenvalue problem of H, i.e.,
ω = ±ω+,k, and ± ω−,k

(E15)

in Eq. (22).

det(ω − D) · det(cid:2)A − B(ω − D)−1C)(cid:3) = 0, which con-

We have obtained the exact eigenvalues from the ef-
fective Hamiltonian which is derived perturbatively only
up to O(t2
sp). This is because the eigenvalues of the full
Hamiltonian are determined by the roots of det(ω−H) =
tains the term B(ω − D)−1C, equivalent to the second
order perturbation with respect to tsp.

3. Eﬀective Hamiltonian for the upper and lower

Hubbard bands

An eﬀective Hamiltonian projected onto the upper and
lower Hubbard bands is obtained by considering the pro-
jection matrices

P = diag(0, 0, 1, 1)

(E16)

Q = diag(1, 1, 0, 0).

The eﬀective Hamiltonian is then given as

P (ω − H eﬀ (ω))P =

0

0 g−1

eﬀ,Hub(ω)

(cid:18) 0

(cid:19)

(E17)

(E18)

(E20)

28
From Eq. (E20) we ﬁnd that (i) when ω → 0 and at
momentum k away from K and K(cid:48) points, the eﬀective
model simply describes the upper and lower Hubbard
bands in the atomic limit, (ii) when ω → 0 and at k =
K(K(cid:48)), the eﬀective on-site energy of H orbital diverges,
indicating that the contribution of H orbital is absent at
K(K(cid:48)) in the Dirac band, and (iii) when ω → ±|γk|, the
eﬀective on-site energy of H orbital diverges, which is
consistent with the “dark spectral” region found in both
CPT and Hubbard-I approximation. Finally, we note
that the eigenvalues of heﬀ,Hub(ω) are also identical to
the ones obtained by the full eigenvalue problem of H.
