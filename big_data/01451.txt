In the Kerr – Newman spacetime the Teukolsky master equation, governing the fundamental test
ﬁelds, is of great importance. We derive an analogous master equation for the non-rotating C – metric
which encompass massless Klein – Gordon ﬁeld, neutrino ﬁeld, Maxwell ﬁeld, Rarita – Schwinger ﬁeld
and gravitational perturbations. This equation is shown to be separable in terms of “accelerated
spin weighted spherical harmonics”. It is shown that, contrary to ordinary spin weighted spherical
harmonics, the “accelerated” ones are diﬀerent for diﬀerent spins. In some cases, the equation for
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are explicitly solved.

INTRODUCTION

Boost – rotation symmetric spacetimes are a special
class of solutions of vacuum Einstein’s ﬁeld equations
with two symmetries which can represent moving objects
and contain radiation. Some exact explicit solutions be-
longing to this class are e.g. the C – metric [1] and the
solutions found by Bonnor and Swaminarayan [2].
In
general these spacetimes are algebraically general, radia-
tive as shown in [3] and possess a plausible Newtonian
limit [4].

Among these solutions the C – metric is a special case.
It is of Petrov type D — and thus a generalization [5]
admitting charge and rotation could have been found,
involving “uniformly accelerated black holes”.

The method of decoupling and separating variables of
the equations governing fundamental ﬁelds is, of course,
of great importance but it has not been applied to the
C – metric so far.

In general relativity, the decoupling and separation
of variables is often employing the Newman – Penrose
(NP) formalism. If NP formalism is applied to the type
D spacetimes, the equations for radiative (ingoing and
outgoing radiation) components of (a) massless Klein-
Gordon ﬁeld (s = 0), (b) neutrino ﬁeld (s = 1/2),
(c) test Maxwell ﬁeld (s = 1), (d) Rarita – Schwinger
ﬁeld (s = 3/2) and (e) linear gravitational perturbations
(s = 2) can be decoupled [6], [7], and in the case of
Kerr – Newman metric they can be also separated. We
rewrite these equations in Geroch – Held – Penrose (GHP)
formalism [8] in Section IV. In Section II, we review some
elementary concepts of the Ernst projection formalism
which we later connect to the NP formalism.

The background metric – the C – metric – is presented
in Section III. For more details see [9], [10], [11] which
encompass comprehensive historical introduction. The

equation analogous to the Teukolsky master equation is
obtained in Section IV for the charged C – metric. We
show that the solution of this equation can be found us-
ing separation of variables in the canonical coordinates
[10]. The angular part of the solution leads to gener-
alized “accelerated spin weighted spherical harmonics” 1.
These are in general Heun [12] functions, but for extremal
case the solutions reduce to rational functions. We ﬁnd
the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for axially symmetric
ﬁelds (m = 0) in Section V and show why for m diﬀerent
from zero this is diﬃcult, solving the same problem for
cosmic string spacetime (the C – metric inherently con-
tains deﬁcit angle) in Section X.

The electromagnetic ﬁeld which was the primary moti-
vation is then analysed in a more detailed way in section
VIII.

Contrary to ordinary spin weighted spherical harmon-
ics the accelerated ones form more complicated structure
as they are split into diﬀerent families according to the
spin S of the ﬁeld, this issue is discussed in section IX.

II. ERNST PROJECTION FORMALISM

A well known fact is that in vacuum spacetimes every
Killing vector can serve as a 4-potential of a test elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. The straightforward generalization to
spacetimes with matter can be done with the help of the
Ernst projection formalism.

In the presence of the Killing vector ﬁeld ξ, the Ernst
projection formalism [13], [14] can be used to solve the
full Einstein – Maxwell equations. But the Ernst equa-
tions can be used for solving Maxwell equations for test
electromagnetic ﬁeld (which respects the symmetry in-
duced by the aforementioned Killing vector ﬁeld,
i.e.
LξF = 0) on a given background.

1 This terminology can be disputed since these solutions are not

in general eigenfunctions of Laplace’s operator.

Let F be an electromagnetic ﬁeld for which LξF = 0,
then the potential Ψ with respect to the Killing vector ξ
can be introduced2

The structure function G(ξ) is given by the fourth order
polynomial

(1)

and, conversely,

r κ

2

F ∗

ab = 2F −1(cid:0)ξ[aΨ,b](cid:1)∗

.

(2)

The inverse of the norm of the Killing vector in this equa-
tion is the reason that only very special solutions with re-
spect to general linear combination of timelike and space-
like KV are, though mathematically possible, physically
relevant. Covariant divergence of (2) gives the equation
for Ψ

F (cid:19);a
F (cid:18) Ψ,a

+ iωa(cid:18) Ψ,a

F (cid:19) = 0 .

(3)

which is a linear PDE where

F = ξaξa,

ωa = εabcd ξb ξc;d .

(4)

The equation (3) is a mid-step in derivation of Ernst
equations (for details presented in modern fashion see
[8]) where the norm F of KV ξ is identiﬁed with −F =
2(cid:0)E + ¯E(cid:1) + ¯ΦΦ, where E is so called the gravitational
Ernst potential whereas Φ is the electromagnetic Ernst
potential

1

F (cid:3)E =(cid:0)∇aE + 2 ¯Φ∇aΦ(cid:1)∇aE ,
F (cid:3)Φ =(cid:0)∇aE + 2 ¯Φ∇aΦ(cid:1)∇aΦ .

(5)

(6)

For a given spacetime the Ernst potentials can be calcu-
lated. And these two potentials are solutions of Maxwell
equations for test ﬁeld (3) with Ψ = Φ or Ψ = E.

III. NON-ROTATING C – METRIC

The non-rotating C – metric, a space-time representing
two3 in general charged uniformly accelerated black holes
[9], [11], is given in a modern form [10] with factorized
structure function G(ξ) by

ds2 =

1

A2 (x − y)2"K 2

τ G(y) dτ 2 −

1

G(y)

dy2+

G(ξ) =(cid:0)1 − ξ2(cid:1) (1 + Arp ξ) (1 + Armξ) ,

(8)

in which the structure of roots is deﬁned by −∞ <
−1/Arm < −1/Arp < −1. The parameter A deﬁnes the
acceleration of the black hole and parameters rp , rm can
be related to mass parameter M and charge4 parameter
q by

rp = M +pM 2 − q2 ,

rm = M −pM 2 − q2 .

(9)

The metric (7) covers several regions of the spacetime
but we are interested in the asymptotically ﬂat region
outside the black hole which is covered by coordinate
ranges τ ∈ R, y ∈ h−1/Arp , 1i (with y = −1/Arp being
the black hole horizon and y = −1 being the acceleration
horizon), x ∈ h1, −1i (axis given by x = ±1) and x −
y < 0 (the asymptotic inﬁnity is located at x − y = 0)
and, ﬁnally, ϕ ∈ h0, 2πi. The strength of the conical
singularity which is inevitably present in the C – metric
is governed by the parameter Kϕ. The constant Kτ can,
of course, be absorbed in deﬁnition of τ but we leave it
explicitly present.

Let us assume that we have a potential Ψ(τ )(y, x, ϕ)
of (3) with respect to the boost Killing vector ξ(τ ), resp.
Ψ(ϕ)(τ, y, x) with respect to the axial Killing vector ξ(ϕ).
The equation (3) for Ernst electromagnetic potential on
the C – metric background is separable in both cases, i.e.
let us assume that Ψ(τ ) = ˆY (y) ˆX(x) ˆP (ϕ) and Ψ(ϕ) =
˜T (τ ) ˜Y (y) ˜X(x). Then separated equations read

From the Ernst potential Ψ(·) we can construct the

We observe that there exists a class of solutions for
which Lξ(ϕ) F = Lξ(τ ) F = 0 at the same time and thus
we can ﬁnd both potentials for this ﬁeld. This gives us
a relation between solutions of equations (24) and (27).
If V is solution of (GV,z),z + λV = 0 then U = GV,z is
solution of the equation GU,zz +λU = 0. And, conversely,
let U be the solution of GU,zz + λU = 0 then V = U,z is
solution of (GV,z),z + λV = 0.
More generally, the Ernst potential can be found for
a general linear combination of ξ(τ ) and ξ(ϕ) if the Lie
derivative of the electromagnetic ﬁeld along this vector
ﬁeld vanishes, but then the separation of variables leads
to static and axially symmetric solutions only.

IV. MASTER EQUATION

Teukolsky [6] provided decoupled equations for NP
components of gravitational perturbation Ψ0 and Ψ4, of
test electromagnetic ﬁeld Φ0 and Φ2 and neutrino ﬁeld χ0
and χ1 in general type D spacetime and performed a de-
tailed analysis of these equations on the Kerr – Newman
background. The C – metric is also a type D solution and
therefore we can perform a similar analysis. The equa-
tions6 for gravitational perturbations reads

which leads to massless Klein – Gordon (s = 0) equation

Thus (48) is indeed the massless Klein – Gordon equation
(for Ricci ﬂat type D spacetimes).

Only massless Klein – Gordon equation is separable on
the C – metric background; and so is the Dirac equation
— which in the massless limit is the Weyl neutrino equa-
tion and thus is already included above.

We have also discussed only NP scalars of maximal spin
weight because only for these the equations are decoupled
in type D spacetimes. Of course, to solve completely,
for example, the electromagnetic ﬁeld, we would have to
analyze also Φ1.

If the function G(ξ) is even (G(ξ) = G(−ξ)) and if
X (s)
(lm)(x) is solution of equation (56) then the solution
for −s is given by X (−s)

(lm)(−x).
With the help of computer algebra systems we
(56)
for arbitrary
function G(ξ) =

are able to ﬁnd a solution of
s, m, Λ and general
structure

(lm) (x) = X (s)

(cid:0)1 − ξ2(cid:1) (1 + Arp ξ) (1 + Armξ) in terms of general Heun

function. For some special cases we can ﬁnd the solution
explicitly, even in terms of rational functions, not only
formally as a Heun general function.

V. ACCELERATED SPIN WEIGHTED

SPHERICAL HARMONICS

A. Extremal case

According to [16] the spin weighted spheroidal harmon-

ics are regular solutions to the equation

The constant c arises in the equation during the separa-
tion of variables of various ﬁelds on the Kerr – Newman
background only if aω 6= 0. In the limit c = 0 the sepa-
ration constant is A(s)
(lm) = l(l + 1)− s(s + 1) and then the
standard spin weighted spherical harmonics are obtained.
The separation of variables of master equation for the

C – metric (53) leads to the equation

for angular part which, according to Sturm – Liouville
theory, posses an inﬁnite number of regular orthogonal
solutions. These solutions form a base for L2 functions
on interval x ∈ h−1, 1i. This equation is a generaliza-
tion of (55) with c = 0 (we are investigating non-rotating
case, i.e. a = 0) for accelerated sources7.

in the limit
rp = rm = 0 and Kϕ = 1 the standard spin weighted spheri-
cal harmonics are recovered.

For the extremal case rp = rm the solution of (56) reg-
ular in the entire interval x ∈ h−1, 1i with m = 0 for
general half-integer s has been found in terms of ratio-

so the eigenvalue problem ∆(2D)Φ = −Λ(lm)Φ can be
separated using ansatz Φ = eimϕ ˜X , where
hG(x) ˜X(lm),xi,x

Together with the appropriate boundary conditions this
is again the formulation of Sturm – Liouville problem for
eigenfunctions ˜X(lm) and eigenvalues Λlm.

This equation (which arises from the separation of
variables for the electromagnetic Ernst potential (3)) is
clearly diﬀerent from (56) (which arises during the sepa-
ration of variables for master equation (53)) because the
latter contains a term proportional to G(x),xx for any
s. Thus, (68) does not ﬁt in the scheme immediately.
Yet, it shows the way how to construct a basis of spin
1 weighted accelerated spherical harmonics from a scalar
basis on this “sphere” ˜Y(lm) = ˜X(lm)eimϕ; the solutions of
(56) are given by

which resembles the standard procedure of generating

point as the structure function G(ξ) and the inﬁnity,

(73)

The explicit solutions of (72) is probably impossible to
ﬁnd but let us analyze the behavior of the solutions at
the outer black hole horizon y = −1/Arp , the acceler-
ation horizon y = −1 for the static case ω = 0. Then
y = −1/Arp , y = −1 are regular singular points of the
equation (72) all of them with characteristic exponents
(0, −s) regardless the Λ(s)
for nondegenerated case
rp 6= rm. In the extremal case8 the characteristic expo-
nents of singular point y = −1/Arp are (l− s, −l− s− 1).
In the C – metric the inﬁnity which is interesting is S +
which is not easy to describe in these coordinates and
thus the asymptotic behaviour of ﬁelds at S will be dis-
cussed elsewhere.

(lm)

The theory of ordinary diﬀerential equations can pro-
vide us with the behaviour of two linearly independent
solutions in the vicinity of regular singular points. Sort
the exponents at the singularity and thus deﬁne R1 =
max{0,−s} and R2 = min{0,−s} so that R1 ≥ R2. Let
σj = 1 +P∞
k=1 ajk(y − ys)k; the ﬁrst solution around a
singular point ys is then
Y (s)A
(lm) = (y − ys)R1 σ1,

(74)

and the second one is for R1 − R2 ∈ N0 + 1/2

Y (s)B
(lm) = (y − ys)R2 σ2 ,

or, for s ∈ N0

(lm) = (y − ys)R2 σ2 + c ln (y − ys)Y (s)A
Y (s)B
(lm) ,

where the constant c can be zero.

(75)

(76)

In the static (ω = 0), axisymmetric (m = 0) — i.e.
for static (moving along ξτ ) axisymmetric sources of test
ﬁeld — and extremal (rm = rp ) case the two linearly
independent solutions can be found explicitly in terms of
hypergeometric functions, for s ≥ 0

VIII. ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD, A DEEPER

ANALYSIS

First of all let us remind that there is an almost forgot-
ten reference in Bičák [19] that for the D type spacetimes
Fackerell and Ipser [20] gave a decoupled equation even
for electromagnetic scalar Φ1

(cid:2)(D + ǫ + ¯ǫ − ̺ − ¯̺) (∆ + 2µ)

− (δ + ¯π − ¯α + β − τ )(cid:0)¯δ + 2π(cid:1)(cid:3)Φ1 = 0 ,

This equation is separable, using the ansatz

(79)

Φ1 = A2(x − y)2e−iωτ eimϕY (0)

(lm)(y)X (0)

(lm)(x) ,

(80)

the separation leads to equations

(83)

In the equation (81) we can plainly recognize the equation
(68) for eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator on the
“sphere” (x, ϕ).

The self-conjugated form of electromagnetic ﬁeld ten-
sor F ∗ can be reconstructed from the complex NP scalars
in the case of non-rotating C – metric in the tetrad (13).
Le us take a closer look at the static electromagnetic
ﬁeld (ω = 0). The static observer, comoving with the
black hole, has four velocity

u =

A(x − y)
p−G(y)

∂
∂τ

.

(84)

This observer measures electric ﬁeld E and magnetic ﬁeld
B

M ≡ E + iB = u · F ∗ ,

(85)

which we project onto the orthonormal basis (ˆey, ˆex, ˆeϕ)

ˆMy ≡ M · ˆey = −Φ1 ,
ˆMx ≡ M · ˆex =

ˆMϕ ≡ M · ˆeϕ =

.

The scalar Φ1 describes purely radial behavior of the ﬁeld
and so it is not important for the discussion of the regu-
larity conditions of the ﬁeld in the vicinity of the axis.

8 And thus only for axially symmetric conﬁgurations.

Summing up all the known informations, i.e. ansatz
from table I and “symmetry” in radial solutions (72), we

get

Φ0 = a(1)
Φ2 = a(−1)
= a(−1)

(lm)A3(x − y)3Y (1)

The trivial

solution of Maxwell’s equation,

is singular9 at ξ = −1 and, due to the contiguous rela-
tions among hypergeometric functions (see §15.5(ii) of
[21]), can be expressed in terms of 2F1(cid:0) 1, 1
2 ; z(cid:1) which
equals to −z−1 ln (1 − z) (a few formulas can be found
in appendix A).
the
“Coulomb potential”, given by the Ernst potential Ψ(τ ) =
Φ(τ ) = y leads to NP coeﬃcients Φ0 = 0, Φ1 =

−A2 (x − y)2 √2/Kτ and Φ2 = 0 which compared with
(80) trivially yield expansion as Φ1 ∼ X (0)r
The other solution of test Maxwell equations which is
given by Ψ(τ ) = E (τ ) represents, in the Minkowski limit,
uniform electric ﬁeld aligned parallel to the symmetry
axis. From (32) and (80) follows

Firstly, we notice, that even the “Coulomb part”
is
present in the expansion. Secondly, although it looks
it can be explicitly checked that the inte-
nontrivial,
(x−y)2 − r2
(l0) dx (including logarithmic
(l0) after using the contiguous

p y2iX (0)r
gral R 1
terms) is proportional to Y (0)s
For this test ﬁeld the NP scalars diverge at y = −1
because the “sources” are located at inﬁnity. Yet, it is
merely an artefact of the choice of tetrad, the invariant
Φ0Φ2 − Φ2
1 doesn’t have any singularities at the acceler-
ation horizon.
Clearly, the integral R 1
−1 Φ1/ (x − y)2 dx can be per-
formed only for y < −1 because the range of the coordi-
nates is given by the condition x − y < 0 and thus the
“sphere” y =const exists only for y < −1.
The series is inﬁnite even in the Minkowski limit which
only seemingly contradicts the known result that the ho-
mogeneous ﬁeld is just an l = 1 mode. The reason lies
in the fact that this system is uniformly accelerated and
therefore also even Φ0 and Φ2 are nonzero.

The detail analysis of electromagnetic ﬁeld will be

given in a following paper.

IX. SPIN WEIGHT RAISING AND LOWERING

OPERATORS

From what we have seen so far it is necessary, con-
trary to the standard spin weighted harmonics, to distin-
guish between ﬁelds of diﬀerent spin. For every spin S,
there is a sequence10 of spin weighted accelerated spher-
ical harmonics Y (s,S)
(lm) eimϕ with spin weight

(lm) = X (s,S)

for which the standard discussion (i.e. as done for Reiss-
ner – Nordström black hole) of regularity of vector ﬁelds
can be done.

In the section II we showed how to ﬁnd two solutions
of test Maxwell equations using the Ernst formalism and
provided some symmetries between equations for m = 0.
Let us use these result in the extreme and static case (so
explicit solutions of radial and angular parts exist).

We can calculate the Ernst potentials Φ(τ ) and E (τ ) for

the non-rotating C-metric. They are

Φ(τ ) = y ,
E (τ ) =

G(y)

(x − y)2 − q2y2 .

(94)

(95)

The appropriate NP scalars are given by (31) – (33).

These solutions are static and axially symmetric there-
fore they can be expanded in terms of the basis given by
solution of (81) and (82) with ω = m = 0. They can be
solved by looking for solution of GU,ξξ + ΛU as discussed
in section II.
Let us investigate the extreme case q = rm = rp . Then
we can ﬁnd the solutions of (81) and (82) in terms of
hypergeometric functions

(l0) = Y (0)r
X (0)r

10 Therefore it would be more appropriate to denote these spin

(lm) , or they x component
(lm) — we have not used this notation in the previous

weighted spherical harmonics with Y
with X (s,S)

(97)

s ∈ (−S, −S + 1, . . . , S). This sequence can be gen-
erated using the universal spin weight raising operator

(100)

The complete scheme can be found in table II, where
the arrows mean lowering and raising spin weight and
the ﬁelds are labeled by their spin and spin weight (for
example gravitational perturbation Ψ4 → Ψ(−2,2) or
Σ3 → Σ(−3/2,3/2) and so on).
In the limit rp → 0 and
Kϕ → 1, the eigenfunctions of operators no longer de-
pend on spin of the ﬁeld S but only on the spin weight
s of the particular component (as schematically depicted
in the last two lines ot the table II).

Thus, more properly, the equation (56) for accelerated
spin weighted spherical harmonics should be written as

(101)

it holds only for the maximal spin weight s = ±S.
Although the equations for non – extreme components
(|s| 6= S) are not known for S > 1, the following state-
ment can be proved: Let Y (S,S)
(lm) be a solution of (101) for
arbitrary S. Then applying (2S− 1) times ¯ð and thus ob-
taining Y (−S,S)
we get a solution of eigenvalue problem
(101) with s = −S if

(lm)

dξn G(ξ) = 0

for

n ≥ 5 ,

(102)

which holds even for the charged and rotating C – metric.

X. COSMIC STRING SPACETIME

As soon as the spherical symmetry is abandoned every-
thing becomes more complicated. As one of the simplest
examples the cosmic string spacetime can serve. The
metric can be obtained as a zero mass and zero charge
limit of the C – metric; written in quasi – spherical coor-
dinates it reads

ds2 = −dt2 + dr2 + r2(cid:0)dθ2 + K 2

ϕ sin2 θ dϕ2(cid:1) ,

and represents ﬂat spacetime with a cosmic string aligned
along the z-axis.

(103)

To analyse ﬁelds on this spacetime it is evidently of no

sense to use spherical harmonics.

The relevant (angular) part of the metric is

ds2 = dθ2 + K 2

ϕ sin2 θ dϕ2
dx2

=

1 − x2 + (1 − x2) K 2

ϕ

dϕ2 .

(104)

The separation of variables for equation ∆Φ(x, ϕ) =

XI. CONCLUSIONS

We have derived an analogy of the Teukolsky master
equation for non-rotating C – metric; provided the notion
of accelerated spin weighted spherical harmonics, some of
which we have found explicitly. We paid special attention
to electromagnetic ﬁeld which we solved completely. We
showed that for non-axisymmetric conﬁgurations m 6= 0
the complete basis is diﬃcult to ﬁnd.

some of the hypergeometric functions to elementary func-
tions using the fact that

We for a general hypergeometric function W 2F1(cid:16) a, b

we can deﬁne the operators A+, B+ and C+ which are
raising the parameters a, b and c by

c ; z(cid:17)

Using these operators the hypergeometric function for
a, b, c ∈ N and c ≥ 2 can be expressed in terms of loga-
rithms by

2F1(cid:18) a, b
