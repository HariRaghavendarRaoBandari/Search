Abstract

This paper is devoted to the Lp (p > 1) solutions of one-dimensional backward stochastic diﬀerential

equations (BSDEs for short) with general time intervals and generators satisfying some non-uniform

conditions in t and ω. An existence and uniqueness result, a comparison theorem and an existence result

for the minimal solutions are respectively obtained, which considerably improve some known works.

Some classical techniques used to deal with the existence and uniqueness of Lp (p > 1) solutions of

BSDEs with Lipschitz or linear-growth generators are also developed in this paper.

Keywords: Backward stochastic diﬀerential equation, Existence and uniqueness, Comparison theorem,

Minimal solution, Non-uniform condition in (t, ω)

1. Introduction

Let us ﬁx a extended real number 0 ≤ T ≤ +∞, which can be ﬁnite or inﬁnite. Let (Ω, F , P ) be a

probability space carrying a standard d-dimensional Brownian motion (Bt)t≥0 and (Ft)t≥0 be the natural

σ-algebra generated by (Bt)t≥0. We assume that FT = F and (Ft)t≥0 is right-continuous and complete.

In this paper, we are concerned with the following one-dimensional backward stochastic diﬀerential

equation (BSDE for short in the remaining):

yt = ξ +Z T

t

g(s, ys, zs)ds −Z T

t

zs · dBs, t ∈ [0, T ],

(1.1)

where the extended real number T is called the terminal time, ξ is a one-dimensional FT -measurable

random variable called the terminal condition, the random function g(ω, t, y, z) : Ω × [0, T ] × R × Rd 7→

R is (Ft)-progressively measurable for each (y, z) called the generator of BSDE (1.1). The solution

(yt, zt)t∈[0,T ] is a pair of (Ft)-progressively measurable processes and the triple (ξ, T, g) is called the

parameters of BSDE (1.1). BSDE with the parameters (ξ, T, g) is usually denoted by BSDE (ξ, T, g).

The nonlinear BSDEs were initially introduced by Pardoux and Peng (1990). They proved an exis-

tence and uniqueness result for L2 solutions of multidimensional BSDEs. In their work, the assumptions

of generator g is Lipschitz continuous with respect to (y, z) uniformly in (t, ω), and the terminal time T

is ﬁnite, the terminal condition ξ and the process {g(t, 0, 0)}t∈[0,T ] are square integrable. From then on,

BSDEs have been extensively studied and many applications have been found in mathematical ﬁnance,

stochastic control, partial diﬀerential equations and so on (see El Karoui, Peng and Quenez (1997) and

Morlais (2009) for details). On the other hand, many papers have been devoted to relaxing the uniform

Lipschitz condition on the generator g, improving the ﬁnite terminal time into the inﬁnite case and

studying the solutions under non-square integrable parameters.

Many works including Mao (1995), Lepeltier and San Martin (1997), Bahlali (2001), Briand, Delyon, Hu, Pardoux and

(2003), Hamad`ene (2003), Briand, Lepeltier and San Martin (2007), Briand and Confortola (2008), Wang and Huang

(2009), Chen (2010), Delbaen, Hu and Bao (2011), Ma, Fan and Song (2013), Hu and Tang (2015) and

Fan (2016), see also the references therein, weakened the uniform Lipschitz condition on the generator

g, and some of them investigated the Lp (p > 1) solution of BSDE (1.1). Chen and Wang (2000) ﬁrst

improved the result of Pardoux and Peng (1990) to the inﬁnite time interval case and proved an existence

and uniqueness result for the L2 solution of BSDE (1.1) where the generator g is Lipschitz continuous

in (y, z) non-uniformly with respect to t. Furthermore, Fan, and Jiang (2010) and Fan, Jiang and Tian

(2011) relaxed the Lipschitz condition of Chen and Wang (2000) and obtained two existence and unique-

ness results for the L2 solution of BSDE (1.1) with ﬁnite and inﬁnite time intervals, which also generalizes

the results of Mao (1995) and Lepeltier and San Martin (1997) respectively.

We especially mention that El Karoui and Huang (1997) ﬁrst introduced a stochastic Lipschitz con-

dition of the generator g in (y, z), where the Lipschitz constant depends also on (t, ω). They investigated

a general time interval BSDE driven by a general c`adl`ag martingale, and some stronger integrability

conditions on the generator and terminal condition as well as on the solutions make it possible to replace

the uniform Lipschitz condition by a stochastic one. In this spirit, Bender and Kohlmann (2000) and

Wang, Ran and Chen (2007) respectively proved an existence and uniqueness result for the L2 solution

and Lp (p > 1) solution of BSDE (1.1) with a general time horizon. After that, Briand and Confortola

(2008) introduced another stochastic Lipschitz condition involving a bounded mean oscillation martingale

and investigated the Lp (for some certain p > 1) solution of a inﬁnite dimensional BSDE, where some

new higher order integrability conditions on the generator and terminal condition (see their assumptions

A3 and A4 for details) need to be satisﬁed.

Motivated by these results, in this paper, we ﬁrst put forward a new stochastic Lipschitz condition (see

(H1) in Section 3) and prove an existence and uniqueness result of the Lp (p > 1) solution of BSDE (1.1)

with a ﬁnite and inﬁnite time interval (see Theorem 3.1). We do not impose any stronger integrability

conditions to the parameters (ξ, g) and the solution (y, z) as made in El Karoui and Huang (1997),

Bender and Kohlmann (2000) and Wang, Ran and Chen (2007), and the integrability condition (3.1) is

the only requirement in (H1). By introducing an example, we also show that our stochastic Lipschitz

condition is strictly weaker than the Lipschitz condition non-uniformly in t used in Chen and Wang

(2000) (see Example 3.1). And by using stopping times to subdivide the interval [0, T ], we successfully

overcome a new diﬃculty arisen naturally in our framework, see the proof of Theorem 3.1. Furthermore,

in Section 4, by developing a method employed in Fan, Jiang and Tian (2011) and Ma, Fan and Song

(2013) we establish a general comparison theorem for the Lp (p > 1) solutions of BSDEs when one of

2

generators satisﬁes a monotonicity condition in y and a uniform continuity condition in z, which are

both non-uniform in (t, ω) (see Theorem 4.1). Finally, in Section 5, we prove an existence result of the

minimal Lp (p > 1) solution for BSDE (1.1) when the generator g is continuous and has a linear growth

in (y, z) non-uniform in (t, ω) (see Theorem 5.1), by improving the method used in Izumi (2013) to prove

in a direct way that the sequence of solutions of the BSDEs approximated by Lipschitz generators is

a Cauchy sequence in Sp × M p. And, based on Theorem 5.1 together with Theorem 4.1, we will also

give a new comparison theorem of the minimal Lp (p > 1) solutions of BSDEs (see Theorem 5.2), and a

general existence and uniqueness theorem of Lp (p > 1) solutions of BSDEs (see Theorem 5.3).

We would like to mention that our results considerably improve some known works including those

obtained in Pardoux and Peng (1990), Chen and Wang (2000), Briand, Lepeltier and San Martin (2007),

Chen (2010) and Fan, Jiang and Tian (2011) etc. And, some classical techniques used to deal with the

existence and uniqueness of Lp (p > 1) solutions of BSDEs with Lipschitz or linear-growth generators

are also developed in this paper.

2. Notations and lemmas

In this section, we introduce some basic notations and deﬁnitions, which will be used in this paper.

First, we use | · | to denote the norm of Euclidean space Rd. For each subset A ⊂ Ω × [0, T ], let 1A = 1
in case of (ω, t) ∈ A, otherwise, let 1A = 0. For each real number p > 1, let Lp(Ω, FT , P ; R) be the set
of all R-valued and FT -measurable random variables ξ such that E[|ξ|p] < +∞, and Sp(0, T ; R) (or Sp

simply) denote the set of R-valued, adapted and continuous processes (Yt)t∈[0,T ] such that

kY kSp := E" sup

t∈[0,T ]

|Yt|p#!

p

< +∞.

In the whole paper, let M p(0, T ; Rd) (or M p simply) denote the set of (Ft)-progressively measurable
Rd-valued processes (Zt)t∈[0,T ] such that

kZkM p :=
E
 Z T


0

|Zt|2dt!

p

2




1
p

< +∞.

Obviously, both Sp and M p are Banach spaces for each p > 1.

Finally, let S be the set of all nondecreasing continuous functions φ(·): R+ 7→ R+ with φ(0) = 0 and

φ(x) > 0 for all x ∈ R+, here and hereafter R+ := [0, +∞).

Deﬁnition 2.1. A pair of processes (yt, zt)t∈[0,T ] taking values in R × Rd is called a Lp solution of
BSDE (1.1) for some p > 1, if (yt, zt)t∈[0,T ] ∈ Sp(0, T ; R) × M p(0, T ; Rd) and dP − a.s., BSDE (1.1)

holds true for each t ∈ [0, T ].

Let us introduce the following Lemma 2.1, which will be used in Section 3 and Section 5.

Lemma 2.1. Let p > 1, 0 ≤ T ≤ +∞, and (gt)t∈[0,T ] is a (Ft)-progressively measurable process such

that R T

0 gtdt < +∞, dP − a.s.. If (Yt, Zt)t∈[0,T ] is a Lp solution to the following BSDE:

Moreover, there exists a positive constant ¯Cp depending only on p such that for each t ∈ [0, T ],

Proof. In the same way as Proposition 2.4 in Izumi (2013), we can prove (2.2) and (2.3). It remains to

show (2.4). In fact, by basic inequality 2ab ≤ a2 + b2 and Young’s inequality we have, for each constant

Thus, (2.4) follows immediately from (2.2), (2.3), (2.5) and (2.6).

The following technical Lemma 2.2 comes from Lemma 4 in Fan and Jiang (2011), which will be used

in Section 4. It gives a sequence of upper bounds for functions of linear growth.

Lemma 2.2. Let Ψ(·) : R+ 7→ R+ be a nondecreasing function of linear growth, which means that

Ψ(x) ≤ K(x + 1) (K > 0) holds true for all x ∈ R+. Then for each n ≥ 1,

Ψ(x) ≤ (n + 2K)x + Ψ(cid:18) 2K

n + 2K(cid:19)

holds true for each x ∈ R+.

3. An existence and uniqueness result

In this section, we will use a stopping time technique involved in subdividing the time interval [0, T ] to

prove a general existence and uniqueness result for the Lp (p > 1) solution of BSDE (1.1), and introduce

an example to show that our stochastic Lipschitz condition is strictly weaker than the Lipschitz condition

non-uniformly in t used in Chen and Wang (2000). First, let us introduce the following assumptions with

the generator g, where 0 ≤ T ≤ +∞ and p > 1.

4

(H1) g is Lipschtiz continuous in (y, z) non-uniformly with respect to both t and ω , i.e., there exist two

(Ft)-progressively measurable nonnegative processes {ut(ω)}t∈[0,T ] and {vt(ω)}t∈[0,T ] satisfying

Z T

0

(cid:2)ut(ω) + v2

t (ω)(cid:3) dt ≤ M, dP − a.s.

for some constant M > 0 such that dP × dt − a.e., for each y1, y2 ∈ R, z1, z2 ∈ Rd,

|g(ω, t, y1, z1) − g(ω, t, y2, z2)| ≤ ut(ω)|y1 − y2| + vt(ω)|z1 − z2|;

0 |g(ω, t, 0, 0)|dt(cid:17)pi < +∞.

(H2) Eh(cid:16)R T
Remark 3.1. It is worth noting that the above (3.1) is equivalent to (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)R T

the sake of convenience, the ω in ut(ω) and vt(ω) is usually omitted without confusion.

0 ut(ω) + v2

t (ω)dt(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)∞

The following Theorem 3.1 shows an existence and uniqueness result for Lp(p > 1) solutions of BSDEs

under assumptions (H1) and (H2), which could be seen as a generalization of the results obtained in

Pardoux and Peng (1990) and Chen and Wang (2000), where the ut and vt in (H1) do not depend on ω.

Theorem 3.1. Assume that p > 1, 0 ≤ T ≤ +∞ and the generator g satisﬁes assumptions (H1) and

(H2). Then for each ξ ∈ Lp(Ω, FT , P ; R), BSDE (ξ, T, g) admits a unique Lp solution.

Proof. Assume that (yt, zt)t∈[0,T ] ∈ Sp(0, T ; R) × M p(0, T ; Rd). It follows from (H1) that |g(s, ys, zs)| ≤
|g(s, 0, 0)| + us|ys| + vs|zs|, then from inequality (a + b + c)p ≤ 3p(ap + bp + cp), H¨older’s inequality and

(H2), we have

(3.2)

Thus, we have constructed a mapping from Sp(0, T ; R) × M p(0, T ; Rd) to itself. Denote this mapping

by I : (yt, zt)t∈[0,T ] −→ (Yt, Zt)t∈[0,T ].

Now, suppose that (yi

t, zi

t)t∈[0,T ] ∈ Sp(0, T ; R) × M p(0, T ; Rd), and let (Y i

t , Z i

t )t∈[0,T ] be the mapping

of (yi

Furthermore, (2.4) of Lemma 2.1 yields that there exists a constant cp > 0 depending only on p such

that for each t ∈ [0, T ],

Thus, by virtue of (H1) and H¨older’s inequality we can deduce that for each t ∈ [0, T ],

In the sequel, we choose a large suﬃciently number N such that

and subdivide the interval [0, T ] into some small stochastic intervals like [Ti−1, Ti], i = 1, ···N , by deﬁning

the following (Ft)-stopping times:

T0 = 0;

T1 = inf(cid:26)t ≥ 0 :Z t

which means that I is a strict contraction from Sp(TN −1, T ; R) × M p(TN −1, T ; Rd) into itself. Then

I admits a unique ﬁxed point in this space.

It follows that there exists a unique (yt, zt)t∈[TN −1,T ] ∈
Sp(TN −1, T ; R)×M p(TN −1, T ; Rd) satisfying BSDE (ξ, T, g) on [TN −1, T ]. That is to say, BSDE (ξ, T, g)
admits a unique Lp solution on [TN −1, T ].

6

Finally, note that (3.4) holds true for i = N − 1. By replacing TN −1, T and ξ by TN −2, TN −1 and
yTN −1, respectively, in the above proof, we can obtain the existence and uniqueness for the Lp solution of

BSDE (ξ, T, g) on [TN −2, TN −1]. Furthermore, repeating the above procedure and making use of (3.4),
we deduce the existence and uniqueness for the Lp solution of BSDE (ξ, T, g) on [TN −3, TN −2], · · · , [0, T1].

The proof of Theorem 3.1 is then completed.

Remark 3.2. It is easy to see that Theorem 3.1 holds still true for multidimensional BSDEs.

The following example shows that assumption (H1) is strictly weaker than the corresponding assump-

tion in Chen and Wang (2000). For readers’ convenience, we list the assumption of Chen and Wang

(2000) as the following (H1’):

(H1’) g is Lipschitz continuous in (y, z), non-uniformly in t, i.e., there exist two functions ¯u(t), ¯v(t) :

[0, T ] 7→ R+ satisfying

Z T

0

(cid:2)¯u(t) + ¯v2(t)(cid:3) dt < +∞

such that dP × dt − a.e., for each y1, y2 ∈ R, z1, z2 ∈ Rd,

|g(ω, t, y1, z1) − g(ω, t, y2, z2)| ≤ ¯u(t)|y1 − y2| + ¯v(t)|z1 − z2|.

Example 3.1 Let 0 ≤ T ≤ +∞, and for each t0 ∈ (0, T ), deﬁne the following two stopping times:

τ1(ω) = inf {t > t0 : |Bt0 (ω)|(t − t0) ≥ M/2} ∧ T,

τ2(ω) = inf(cid:8)t > t0 : |Bt0 (ω)|2(t − t0) ≥ M/2(cid:9) ∧ T.

Consider the generator ˜g(ω, t, y, z) := ˜ut(ω)|y| + ˜vt(ω)|z|, where

˜ut(ω) = |Bt0 (ω)|1((t0,τ1(ω)]](ω, t), ˜vt(ω) = |Bt0|1((t0,τ2(ω)]](ω, t),

(t, ω) ∈ [0, T ] × Ω.

It is clear that ˜g satisﬁes assumptions (H1) and (H2) with ut = ˜ut and v(t) = ˜vt. Then, by Theorem 3.1
we know that for each p > 1 and each ξ ∈ Lp(Ω, FT , P ; R), BSDE (ξ, T, ˜g) admits a unique Lp solution.

We especially mention that this ˜g does not satisfy the above assumption (H1’). In fact, if assumption

(H1’) holds true for ˜g, then there exist two deterministic functions ¯u(t), ¯v(t) : [0, T ] 7→ R+ such that

˜ut(ω) ≤ ¯u(t),

˜vt(ω) ≤ ¯v(t), dP × dt − a.e.

and

Z T

0

(cid:2)¯u(t) + ¯v2(t)(cid:3) dt < +∞.

This yields a contradiction which will be shown below. Note ﬁrst that for each t ∈ (t0, T ), we have

(3.5)

(3.6)

{ω : ˜ut(ω) > ¯u(t)} = {ω : t ≤ τ1(ω) and |Bt0(ω)| > ¯u(t)}

=(cid:26)ω : |Bt0 (ω)| ≤

M

2(t − t0)

and |Bt0 (ω)| > ¯u(t)(cid:27) ,

7

and note that Bt0 (ω) is a normal random variable with zero-expected value and t0-variance values. If
¯u(t) < M

2(t−t0) for some t ∈ (t0, T ), then P ({ω : ˜ut(ω) > ¯u(t)}) > 0. Using this fact and (3.5) we can

conclude that

¯ut ≥

M

2(t − t0)

, dt − a.e. in (t0, T ).

Thus,

Z T

0

¯u(t)dt ≥

M

2 Z T

t − t0

dt = +∞,

which contradicts with (3.6).

Hence, our assumption (H1) is strictly weaker than (H1’) used in Chen and Wang (2000).

4. A general comparison theorem

In this section, by developing a method employed in Fan, Jiang and Tian (2011) and Ma, Fan and Song

(2013) we will prove a general comparison theorem for the Lp (p > 1) solution of BSDE (1.1). Let us

ﬁrst introduce the following assumptions, where 0 ≤ T ≤ +∞.

(H3) g is monotonic in y, non-uniformly with respect to both t and ω , i.e., there exists a (Ft)-

progressively measurable nonnegative process {ut(ω)}t∈[0,T ] satisfying

Z T

0

for some constant M > 0 such that dP × dt − a.e., for each y1, y2 ∈ R, z1, z2 ∈ Rd,

(H4) g is uniformly continuous in z, non-uniformly with respect to both t and ω , i.e., there exist a linear-

growth function φ(·) ∈ S and a (Ft)-progressively measurable nonnegative process {vt(ω)}t∈[0,T ]

Here and henceforth, we always assume that 0 ≤ φ(x) ≤ ax + b for all x ∈ R+. Furthermore, when

b 6= 0, we also assume that R T

0 vt(ω)dt ≤ M , dP − a.s., where M is deﬁned in (H3).

The following Theorem 4.1 establishes a general comparison theorem for BSDEs under assumptions

(H3) and (H4), which generalizes partly Theorem 2 in Fan, Jiang and Tian (2011), where the ut(ω) and

vt(ω) in (H3) and (H4) do not depend on ω and p = 2, and Lemma 1 in Ma, Fan and Song (2013), where

the ut(ω) and vt(ω) need to be bounded processes and T < +∞.

Theorem 4.1. Let p > 1, 0 ≤ T ≤ +∞, ξ, ξ′ ∈ Lp(Ω, FT , P ; R), g and g′ be two generators of
BSDEs, and let (yt, zt)t∈[0,T ] and (y′
t)t∈[0,T ] be, respectively, a Lp solution to BSDE (ξ, T, g) and BSDE
(ξ′, T, g′). If dP − a.s., ξ ≤ ξ′, g (resp. g′) satisﬁes (H3) and (H4) and dP × dt − a.e., g(t, y′
t) ≤

t, z′

dP − a.s., yt ≤ y′
t.

Proof. Assume that dP −a.s., ξ ≤ ξ′, g satisﬁes (H3) and (H4) and dP ×dt−a.e., g(t, y′

Setting ˆyt = yt − y′

t, ˆzt = zt − z′

t, ˆξ = ξ − ξ′, since g(s, y′

Thus, by taking the conditional expectation with respect to Ft under Pn in (4.4), we obtain that for

t ≤ an, dP − a.s.

(4.6)

And in view of (4.5), it follows that for each t ∈ [0, T ], dP − a.s., yt ≤ y′
t.

Now, let us assume that dP − a.s., ξ ≤ ξ′, g′ satisﬁes (H3) and (H4) and dP × dt − a.e., g(t, yt, zt) ≤

g′(t, yt, zt). Then, since g(s, ys, zs) − g′(s, ys, zs) is non-positive, we have

g(s, ys, zs) − g′(s, y′

s),

and using (H3) and (H4), we know that inequality (4.1) holds still true. Therefore, the same proof as

above yields that for each t ∈ [0, T ], dP − a.s., yt ≤ y′

t. Theorem 4.1 is proved.

From Theorem 4.1, the following corollary is immediate.

Corollary 4.1. Let p > 1, 0 ≤ T ≤ +∞, ξ, ξ′ ∈ Lp(Ω, FT , P ; R), one of generaors g and g′ satisfy
assumptions (H3) and (H4), and (yt, zt)t∈[0,T ] and (y′
t)t∈[0,T ] be, respectively, a Lp solution to BSDE
(ξ, T, g) and BSDE (ξ′, T, g′). If dP − a.s., ξ ≤ ξ′, and dP × dt − a.e., g(t, y, z) ≤ g′(t, y, z) for any

t, z′

(y, z) ∈ R × Rd, then for each t ∈ [0, T ], dP − a.s., yt ≤ y′
t.

5. An existence result of the minimal solutions

In this section, we will put forward and prove an existence result of the minimal Lp (p > 1) solution for

BSDE (1.1)—Theorem 5.1, by improving the method used in Izumi (2013) to prove in a direct way that

the sequence of solutions of the BSDEs approximated by the Lipschitz generators is a Cauchy sequence

in Sp × M p. And, based on Theorem 5.1 together with Theorem 4.1, we will also give a new comparison

theorem of the minimal Lp (p > 1) solutions of BSDEs (see Theorem 5.2), and a general existence

and uniqueness theorem of Lp (p > 1) solutions of BSDEs (see Theorem 5.3). First, we introduce the

following assumptions with respect to the generator g, where 0 ≤ T ≤ +∞.

(H5) g has a linear growth in (y, z), non-uniformly with respect to both t and ω , i.e., there ex-

ist three (Ft)-progressively measurable nonnegative processes {ut(ω)}t∈[0,T ], {vt(ω)}t∈[0,T ] and

10

{ft(ω)}t∈[0,T ] satisfying

E" Z T

ft(ω)dt!p# < +∞,

and

Z T

(cid:2)ut(ω) + v2

t (ω)(cid:3) dt ≤ M, dP − a.s.,

for some constant M > 0 such that dP × dt − a.e., for each y ∈ R, z ∈ Rd,

|g(ω, t, y, z)| ≤ ft(ω) + ut(ω)|y| + vt(ω)|z|;

(H6) dP × dt − a.e., g(ω, t, ·, ·) : R × Rd 7→ R is a continuous function.

The following Proposition 5.1 will play an important role in the proof of Theorem 5.1. Its proof is

analogous to Lemma 1 in Lepeltier and San Martin (1997), so we omit it here.

Proposition 5.1. Assume that the generator g satisﬁes assumptions (H5) and (H6). Let gn be the

function deﬁned as follows:

gn(ω, t, y, z) :=

inf

(¯y,¯z)∈R1+d

{g(ω, t, ¯y, ¯z) + nut(ω)|y − ¯y| + nvt(ω)|z − ¯z|} .

Then the sequence of function gn is well deﬁned, for each n ≥ 1, gn(ω, t, y, z) is (Ft)-progressively

measurable for each (y, z) ∈ R × Rd, and it satisﬁes, dP × dt − a.e.,

(i) Stochastic linear growth: ∀ y, z, |gn(ω, t, y, z)| ≤ ft(ω) + ut(ω)|y| + vt(ω)|z|;

(ii) Monotonicity in n: ∀ y, z, gn(ω, t, y, z) increases in n;

(iii) Lipschitz condition: ∀ y1, y2, z1, z2, we have

|gn(ω, t, y1, z1) − gn(ω, t, y2, z2)| ≤ nut(ω)|y1 − y2| + nvt(ω)|z1 − z2|;

(iv) Convergence: If (yn, zn) → (y, z), then gn(ω, t, yn, zn) → g(ω, t, y, z), as n → ∞.

Now we state the main result of this section —Theorem 5.1. It improves Theorem 1 in Fan, Jiang and Tian

(2011), where the ut(ω) and vt(ω) in (H5) do not depend on ω, and p = 2, and Theorem 3.3 in Izumi

(2013), where the ut(ω) and vt(ω) need to be bounded processes and T < +∞.

Theorem 5.1. Assume that p > 1, 0 ≤ T ≤ +∞ and that the generator g satisﬁes (H5) and (H6). Then

for each ξ ∈ Lp(Ω, FT , P ; R), BSDE (ξ, T, g) admits a minimal Lp solution (yt, zt)t∈[0,T ], which means
that if (¯yt, ¯zt)u∈[0,T ] is any Lp solution to BSDE (ξ, T, g), then for each t ∈ [0, T ], dP − a.s., yt ≤ ¯yt.

Proof. Let gn be deﬁned as in Proposition 5.1. In view of (i) of Proposition 5.1, for each n ≥ 1, we have

E" Z T

0

|gn(s, 0, 0)|ds!p# ≤ E" Z T

0

fsds!p# < +∞.

In view of (iii) of Proposition 5.1 and (H5), it follows from Theorem 3.1, that for each n ≥ 1, BSDE

(ξ, T, gn) and BSDE (ξ, T, h) admit unique Lp solutions (yn

t , zn

t )t∈[0,T ] and (Yt, Zt)t∈[0,T ], respectively,

11

where h(ω, t, y, z) := ft(ω) + ut(ω)|y| + vt(ω)|z| for each (ω, t, y, z). And in view of (ii) of Proposition 5.1,

Corollary 4.1 yields that for each n ≥ 1 and t ∈ [0, T ], y1

t (ω) ≤ yn

t (ω) ≤ yn+1

t

(ω) ≤ Yt(ω), dP −a.s.. Thus,

there must exist a (Ft)-progressively measurable process (yt)t∈[0,T ] satisfying that for each t ∈ [0, T ],

lim

n→+∞

yn
t (ω) = yt(ω), dP − a.s.,

and for each n ≥ 1,

|yn

t (ω)| ≤ |y1

t (ω)| + |Yt(ω)|, dP − a.s..

Now, let G(ω) = sup

t∈[0,T ]

(|y1

t (ω)| + |Yt(ω)|), we have

E" sup

t∈[0,T ]

|yt|p# ≤ E [Gp] < +∞.

(5.1)

(5.2)

Furthermore, it follows form (2.3) of Lemma 2.1 together with (5.1) and (5.2) that there exists a

constant Cp > 0 depending only on p such that for each n ≥ 1,

On the other hand, in view of (5.10), (5.13) and (iv) of Proposition 5.1, we can assume that, choosing a

subsequence if necessary, as n → ∞,

gn(t, yn

t , zn

t ) → g(t, yt, zt), dP × dt − a.e..

(5.17)

Thus, by (5.15)-(5.17), it follows from Lesbesgue’s dominated convergence theorem that

lim

Finally, taking limits in BSDE (ξ, T, gn) yields that (yt, zt)t∈[0,T ] is a Lp solution of BSDE (ξ, T, g).

It remains to prove that (y., z.) is the minimal Lp solution of BSDE (ξ, T, g), let (ˆyt, ˆzt)t∈[0,T ] be any

solution of BSDE (ξ, T, g). In view of (ii) and (iii) of Proposition 5.1, by Corollary 4.1, we obtain that

dP − a.s., yn

t ≤ ˆyt for each t ∈ [0, T ] and n ≥ 1, from which and by letting n → ∞ we get that for each

t ∈ [0, T ], dP − a.s., yt ≤ ˆyt. The proof of Theorem 5.1 is then complete.

Remark 5.1. In the same way as in Theorem 5.1, we can prove the existence of the maximal Lp (p > 1)

solution of BSDE (1.1) under assumptions (H5) and (H6).

By Theorem 4.1 and the proof of Theorem 5.1, we can easily get the following comparison theorem

on the minimal (resp. maximal) Lp solutions of BSDEs.

Theorem 5.2. Assume that p > 1, 0 ≤ T ≤ +∞, ξ, ξ′ ∈ Lp(Ω, FT , P ; R), and both generators g and g′
satisfy (H5) and (H6). Let (y·, z·) and (y′
·) be, respectively, the minimal (resp. maximal) Lp solution
of BSDE (ξ, T, g) and BSDE (ξ′, T, g′) (recall Theorem 5.1 and Remark 5.1). If dP − a.s., ξ ≤ ξ′ and

·, z′

dP × dt − a.e., g(ω, t, y, z) ≤ g′(ω, t, y, z) for each (y, z) ∈ R × Rd, then for each t ∈ [0, T ],

dP − a.s.,

yt ≤ y′
t.

By Theorem 5.1 and Theorem 4.1, the following Theorem 5.3 follows immediately, which generalizes

Theorem 3.1 in Section 3.

Theorem 5.3. Assume that p > 1, 0 ≤ T ≤ +∞, and the generator g satisﬁes assumption (H2) and

the following assumption (H7):

(H7) g is Lipschitz continuous in y and uniformly continuous in z, non-uniformly with respect to both

t and ω , i.e., there exist a linear-growth function φ(·) ∈ S and two (Ft)-progressively measurable

nonnegative processes {ut(ω)}t∈[0,T ] and {vt(ω)}t∈[0,T ] satisfying

Z T

0

(cid:2)ut(ω) + v2

t (ω)(cid:3) dt ≤ M, dP − a.s.

for some constant M > 0 such that dP × dt − a.e., for each y1, y2 ∈ R, z1, z2 ∈ Rd,

|g(ω, t, y1, z1) − g(ω, t, y2, z2)| ≤ ut(ω)|y1 − y2| + vt(ω)φ(|z1 − z2|).

Then for each ξ ∈ Lp(Ω, FT , P ; R), BSDE (ξ, T, g) admits a unique Lp solution.
