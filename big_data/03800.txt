DIOPHANTINE APPROXIMATION ON MATRICES AND

LIE GROUPS

MENNY AKA, EMMANUEL BREUILLARD, LIOR ROSENZWEIG,

NICOLAS DE SAXC´E

Abstract. We study the general problem of extremality for metric dio-
phantine approximation on submanifolds of matrices. We formulate a
criterion for extremality in terms of a certain family of algebraic obstruc-
tions and show that it is sharp. In general the almost sure diophantine
exponent of a submanifold is shown to depend only on its Zariski clo-
sure, and when the latter is deﬁned over Q, we prove that the exponent
is rational and give a method to eﬀectively compute it. This method
is applied to a number of cases of interest, in particular we manage
to determine the diophantine exponent of random subgroups of certain
nilpotent Lie groups in terms of representation theoretic data.

1. Introduction

Pick n + m vectors x1, . . . , xn+m at random in Rm according to a certain
distribution ν. Take integer linear combinations of the vectors and ask how
close they can get to the origin in Rm. One way to measure this is via the
diophantine exponent, deﬁned as:

β(x) = inf{β > 0;k

m+nXi=1

pixik > kpk−β for all but ﬁnitely many p ∈ Zm+n},

where x = (x1, . . . , xm+n), p = (p1, . . . , pm+n) and where on both sides k · k
is the supremum norm on the coordinates.
In the case when x1 = e1, . . . , xm = em, where e1, . . . , em is the canonical
basis of Rm, and (xm+1, . . . , xm+n) is chosen on a submanifold of Rn, this
question is the topic of Diophantine approximation on submanifolds of ma-
trices, which studies the quality of approximation by integer vectors of the
image of an integer vector under an m× n matrix chosen at random in some
submanifold of Mm,n(R).
When m = 1, this subject has been studied extensively, starting with a
1932 conjecture of Mahler [Mah42], which posited that the Veronese curve

M = {(x, x2, . . . , xn), x ∈ R}

is extremal, i.e. that a random point on it has the same diophantine expo-
nent as a random point in Rn chosen with respect to Lebesgue measure. This
conjecture was proved by Sprindˇzuk [Spr64, Spr69]. We refer the reader to
[Spr64, Spr69, BD99, BRV16] for background on Diophantine approximation
on manifolds.

About twenty years ago, Kleinbock and Margulis [KM98] revolutionized
the subject by introducing methods from dynamics of homogeneous ﬂows
into this area. In particular they settled a conjecture of Sprindˇzuk by es-
tablishing that every analytic submanifold of Rn that is not contained in a
proper aﬃne subspace is extremal (see [BB96] for the state of the art before
their work).

Our ﬁrst goal in this paper is to answer a question of Beresnevich, Klein-
bock and Margulis [BKM15] asking for the right criterion for a subman-
ifold of matrices to be extremal. We were led to this problem after we
observed that a solution would enable us to compute diophantine exponents
for dense subgroups of nilpotent Lie groups, in the spirit of our previous
work [ABRdS15a]. Beyond extremality, our criterion allows us to eﬀectively
compute the exponent of any rationally deﬁned submanifold of matrices. To-
wards the end of the paper, we derive consequences for nilpotent Lie groups.
The results of this paper were announced in [ABRdS15b].

We view the (n + m)-tuple x as a m × (m + n) matrix. We note in
passing that the exponent β(x) depends only on the kernel ker x. Therefore
diophantine approximation on submanifolds of matrices is best phrased in
terms of diophantine approximation of submanifolds of the grassmannian,
here the grassmannian of n-planes in Rn+m. We will keep this observation as
a guiding principle, but will always phrase everything in terms of matrices.
We now describe a family of obvious obstructions to extremality.
Deﬁnition 1.1 (Pencil). Given a real vector subspace W ≤ Rm+n, and an
integer r, we deﬁne the pencil PW,r to be the set of matrices x ∈ Mm,m+n(R)
such that

We say that the pencil is rational if W is rational, i.e. admits a basis
in Qm+n.

dim(xW ) ≤ r.

These pencils are obvious obstructions to extremality, because if W is
rational, then the standard Dirichlet or pigeonhole argument shows that for

DIOPHANTINE APPROXIMATION ON MATRICES AND LIE GROUPS

every x ∈ PW,r

1 + β(x) ≥

dim W

r

.

Indeed there are roughly Rdim W integer points in the ball of radius R in
W , but they get mapped into a ball of radius O(R) in Rr, so, comparing
volumes, ε-balls around each of these points cannot be all disjoint if ε is at
least of order R1−dim W/r. Consequently, we see that if

dim W

m + n

>

(1.2)

m
then the point x is not extremal, since m+n
m is the diophantine exponent of
a random point of Mm,m+n(R) chosen with respect to Lebesgue measure.

r

Pencils satisfying (1.2) will be called constraining pencils, because they
constrain the diophantine exponent away from its extremal value. A pencil is
called proper if it is not all of Mm,m+n(R). When viewed in the grassmannian
(i.e. looking at the set of kernels ker x, with x in a pencil), pencils are well-
studied objects: they are a certain kind of Schubert varieties (see e.g. [GH94,
ch 1. §5]).
When the Zariski closure of M is deﬁned over Q, it turns out that these
obvious obstructions are the only ones, and the following is our ﬁrst main
result.

Theorem 1.2 (Exponent for rational manifolds). Let m, n be positive in-
tegers and M be a connected analytic submanifold of Mm,m+n(R). Assume
that the Zariski closure of M is deﬁned over Q. Then for Lebesgue almost
every point x ∈ M the diophantine exponent is rational and equals

β(x) = max

M⊂PW,r{

r

− 1}.

(1.3)

dim W

Moreover, the maximum in the right-hand side is achieved for a rational W .

In particular we see that the generic value of β(x) is constant, and can
be eﬀectively computed once the pencils containing M are identiﬁed. We
also note that this value is the smallest possible value for the exponent of an
arbitrary point on M, because of the Dirichlet or pigeonhole type argument
explained above.
When speaking of Zariski closure, algebraic subsets and algebraic vari-
eties in this paper, we will always consider these notions in real algebraic
geometry and we refer the reader to the textbook [BCR98] for deﬁnitions
and basic properties. By Lebesgue measure on M we mean the top dimen-
sional Hausdorﬀ measure of the subset M of Mm,m+n(R). We immediately
conclude:
Corollary 1.3. Let M be as in Theorem 1.2. Then M is extremal if and
only if it is not contained in any constraining pencil.

Theorem 1.2 and its proof hold verbatim for more general measures, which
we call locally good measures (see Deﬁnition 2.2.2), and in particular for all
Radon measures that do not give too much mass to neighborhoods of pen-
cils (see Thereom 4.1.2), see our notion of Pl¨ucker-decaying and Schubert-
decaying measures. For this we refer the reader to Corollaries 4.1.3 and
6.2.2.

The above theorem answers a question discussed at the end of the original
paper of Kleinbock and Margulis [KM98, §6.2] and also raised in the problem
list [Gor07, §9.1] as well as in [KMW10, p.23] and [BKM15, Problem 1].
The papers [KMW10] and [BKM15] proposed other suﬃcient criterions for
extremality of an analytic submanifold of Mm,n(R), but they just failed to
be optimal. The weakly non-planar condition of [BKM15] is not strong
enough for example to show extremality in the applications to nilpotent
groups described below. This condition is equivalent in our language to not
being contained in any proper pencil, which is a strictly stronger condition
(see Example 5.1.3).

We now no longer assume the Zariski closure to be deﬁned over Q. In two
papers [Kle03] and [Kle08] Kleinbock studied this situation in the case when
m = 1. He showed in particular that the diophantine exponent of a random
point on a connected analytic submanifold of Rn is well-deﬁned and depends
only on the aﬃne span of the submanifold. In other words a submanifold
inherits its exponent from its aﬃne span. Another remarkable observation
he made there for Rn and in [Kle10] for matrices, is that the diophantine
exponent of a random point is also the worst diophantine exponent of any
point on the submanifold. In the context of matrices, one needs to ﬁnd the
right replacement for the aﬃne span. We show the following:
Theorem 1.4 (Inheritance from Pl¨ucker closure). Let M be a connected
analytic submanifold of Mm,m+n(R). Then the generic value of the dio-
phantine exponent β(x) depends only on the Pl¨ucker closure H(M) of M.
In particular it depends only on the Zariski closure of M in Mm,m+n(R).
Moreover for Lebesgue almost every point x ∈ M

(1.4)

β(x) = inf
y∈M

β(y)

The existence of a generic value for β(x), which is the same for almost
every point x of M, and the identity (1.4) are due to Kleinbock [Kle10,
Theorem 1.4.a]. The fact that this value depends only on the Pl¨ucker closure
has also been obtained recently and independently in [DFSU15, Theorem
1.9].

The Pl¨ucker closure of a subset S in Mm,m+n(R) is the set of all matrices
x that satisfy the same equations of the form x(v) = 0, v ∈ Λ∗Rm+n, as all
elements of S. It contains the Zariski closure of S and is contained in the
intersection of all pencils containing S. See §3.4.
Here again, the theorem and its proof hold for more general measures,
which we call Schubert-decaying measures, instead of the Lebesgue measure
on a connected analytic submanifold. See Corollaries 2.2.5 and 4.1.3. Our
assumptions on the measure are both weaker (in that only neighborhoods of
pencils need to have small mass) and stronger (we require locally doubling)
than those of [DFSU15], where the authors work in the classical setting
of Mm,n(R) and with a class of non necessarily doubling measures, which
encompasses many natural fractal measures of dynamical origin.

We also stress that all of our results will be proved for submanifolds of
Hom(V, E), where V and E are ﬁnite-dimensional real vector spaces of arbi-
trary dimension (we will not assume dim V > dim E as in this introduction).

We further show the following general inequality:

Theorem 1.5 (Bounds for the exponent). Let M be a connected analytic
submanifold of Mm,m+n(R). Then for almost every x ∈ M with respect to
Lebesgue measure:

arbitrary pencils on the right hand side. In particular:

Corollary 1.6. If M is not contained in any constraining pencil, then M
is extremal.

This result stresses that in order to determine the exponent of a subman-
ifold, it is important to identify the pencils in which it is contained. The
search for those pencils can sometimes be greatly simpliﬁed in presence of
a group action with the help of the following lemma, which will serve as a
transition to the description of the results of the second part of this paper.

Lemma 1.7 (Submodularity lemma). Let G be a group acting on the Grass-
mannian Grass(V ) and preserving dimension. Suppose that φ : Grass(V ) →
N is a G-invariant function which is non-decreasing for set inclusion and
submodular in the sense that for any two vector subspaces U and W we have

φ(U + W ) + φ(U ∩ W ) ≤ φ(U ) + φ(W ).

Then the maximum

max

W ∈Grass(V )\{0}

dim W
φ(W )

is attained on a G-invariant subspace.

Theorem 1.2 is deduced from Theorem 1.5 and Lemma 1.7 applied to
the Galois group action on V and to φ(W ) = maxx∈M dim xW . Here is an
example illustrating the use of this lemma in combination with Theorem 1.2
for another group action:

kv0I + v1M + ··· + vpM pk ≥ kvk−β

Example 1.8 (The Veronese manifold in matrices). Let p, s ∈ N. What

is the inﬁmum bβ of all β > 0 such that for almost every M ∈ Ms(R), the
has at most ﬁnitely many integer solutions v ∈ Zp+1 ? The Mahler conjec-
ture proved by Sprindˇzuk mentioned earlier is the case s = 1, and then the
answer is bβ = p. When s > 1, this problem ﬁts the diophantine approx-
imation on submanifolds of matrices scheme: set V = Rp[X] the space of
polynomials of degree at most p with its natural Q-structure, E = Ms(R),
and M ⊂ Hom(V, E) the set of all linear maps P 7→ P (M ). In terms of
matrices, M is just the Veronese manifold {(I, M, . . . , M p) ; M ∈ Ms(R)}.
Using Theorem 1.2 the exponent bβ can be determined once the pencils con-
taining M are determined. But the group G of aﬃne transformations of
the real line acts on V by substitution of the variable and preserves M.

6

M. AKA, E. BREUILLARD, L. ROSENZWEIG, N. DE SAXC´E

So in order to compute the maximum in (1.2), we only need to consider
G-invariant subspaces. This is easily done, and we ﬁnd that

p + 1

1 +bβ = max{

In particular the Veronese manifold is extremal if and only if s ≥ p + 1. In
this example the most constraining pencil is given by the Cayley-Hamilton
relation. See Example 6.2.4 for more details. See also [Kle10, §3.3] and
[DS16], where the Veronese manifold is also considered with respect to a
diﬀerent diophantine approximation scheme, for which it is always extremal.

We now pass to the description of our results regarding diophantine ap-
proximation on nilpotent Lie groups. We refer the reader to our paper
[ABRdS15a] for an introduction and background on the general question
of diophantine approximation on Lie groups. Let us brieﬂy recall here the
diophantine approximation scheme. We are given a connected Lie group G
and a k-tuple of elements g := (g1, . . . , gk). We consider the subgroup Γg
generated by g1, . . . , gk. Its elements can be represented by words w(g) in
the gi’s. We ask: how close to the identity can an element γ of Γg be in
terms of the minimal length ℓ(γ) of a word that represents it ? The follow-
ing deﬁnition is natural. Let d(x, y) be a Riemannian distance on G and let
Vg(n) be the number of elements in Γg that can be represented by a word
of length at most n.
Deﬁnition 1.9. The k-tuple g = (g1, . . . , gk) ∈ Gk (or the subgroup Γg
they generate) is called diophantine if there exists β > 0 such that

d(γ, 1) > Vg(ℓ(γ))−β .

(1.6)

for all but at most ﬁnitely many group elements γ ∈ Γg.

For example in G = (R, +) the pair g = (1, α) is diophantine if and only
if α is a diophantine, i.e. non-Liouville, number. It is easy to check that
this deﬁnition depends only on the subgroup Γg and not on the particular
generating set g. We say that the Lie group G is diophantine on k-letters if
almost every k-tuple in G (chosen independently at random with respect to
Haar measure) is diophantine. We say that it is diophantine if it is diophan-
tine on k-letters for every k ≥ 1. When G = Rn, then Γg is diophantine if
and only if the n× k matrix whose column vectors are g1, . . . , gk is diophan-
tine in the sense that its diophantine exponent (deﬁned as in (2.1)) is ﬁnite.
Hence the connection with diophantine approximation on matrices.

It is conjectured that semisimple real Lie groups are diophantine. It is
fairly easy to see that any nilpotent Lie group with a rational structure (for
its Lie algebra) is diophantine, but in [ABRdS15a] we constructed examples
(arising only in nilpotency class 6 and higher) of non-diophantine nilpotent
Lie groups. They can arise because of some particular feature of the rep-
resentation theory of the general linear group on the free Lie algebra on
k-letters: multiplicity for the s-th homogeneous part, s ≥ 6.
For nilpotent Lie groups the growth function Vg(n) grows at most poly-
nomially, and therefore changing the generating set in Γg does not result in
a change of the exponent β. So it makes sense to ask for the optimal β for

DIOPHANTINE APPROXIMATION ON MATRICES AND LIE GROUPS

7

which (1.6) holds. We call this the exponent of the subgroup Γg. This is
the quantity we study here, with the help of Theorem 1.2 and Lemma 1.7.
Before explaining how to compute the optimal exponent using our results
on diophantine approximation on submanifolds of matrices, we ﬁrst prove
that the optimal exponent always exists.

Theorem 1.10 (Existence of the exponent). Let G be a connected and
simply connected nilpotent real Lie group. Then for each k ≥ dim G/[G, G],
have

there is bβk ∈ R+ ∪ {+∞} such that for almost every k-tuple g ∈ Gk, we

where β(g) is the inﬁmum of all β > 0 such that (1.6) holds.

β(g) = bβk,

The proof is based on the ergodicity of the action of the group of auto-

morphisms of the free Lie algebra on k-tuples of elements in g.

It turns out that the results described above regarding the diophantine
exponent of submanifolds of matrices can be used to determine an explicit

group of unipotent upper-triangular matrices and for free nilpotent groups.

value for bβk for a large class of nilpotent groups. Sections 9 and 10 are
devoted to this. In particular, we compute bβk for metabelian groups, for the
In [ABRdS15a, §5.2] we asked whetherbβk has a limit as k tends to inﬁnity.

With the above tools it is possible to answer this question, in the case when
the nilpotent Lie group G is rational.

tional nilpotent Lie group. Then

dim G(s) , 1].

Here G(s) is the last step in the central descending series of G. We actu-
ally conjecture that the existence and rationality of the limit holds for all
nilpotent Lie groups G, rational or not, provided of course they are diophan-
tine.

This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to an exposition
of the Kleinbock-Margulis method in our context and a description of the
Dani correspondence, which allows to translate the diophantine approxima-
tion problem into a problem about the rate of escape to the cusp of a certain
diagonal ﬂow on the space of lattices. In Section 3 we prove Theorem 1.4.
Section 4 is devoted to locally good measures, which form the right class of
measures for which the quantitative non-divergence estimates of Section 1
hold. We present there a decay criterion on measures on matrices (Schubert
and Pl¨ucker decay) analogous to that of [KLW04a]. In Section 5 we prove
Theorem 1.5 and discuss pencils. In Section 6 we prove the submodular-
ity lemma and complete the proof of Theorem 1.2. In Section 7 we prove
Theorem 1.10 and Theorem 1.11 in Section 8. Section 9 is devoted to some
special examples of nilpotent groups. Finally in Section 10, we give some
directions for future work.

2. Diophantine approximation and flows on the space of

lattices

We recall here the connection between diophantine approximation and
ﬂows on homogeneous spaces, in particular the so-called quantitative non-
divergence estimate, which originates in the work of Margulis [Mar75] and
Dani [Dan85] and was used in this context by Kleinbock and Margulis in
their original paper [KM98]. The main facts in this section are Theorem
2.2.4 and Corollary 2.2.5 about the existence of a local exponent for locally
good measures.

Let E and V be two ﬁnite-dimensional real vector spaces. Let ∆ be a
lattice in V , i.e. a discrete Z-module of full rank. We ﬁx Euclidean norms
on E and V . We consider the following diophantine approximation problem.
Given a linear map x ∈ Hom(V, E), ﬁnd the inﬁmum β(x) of all β > 0 such
that, for all but ﬁnitely many v ∈ ∆ one has
kx(v)k > kvk−β.

(2.1)
Note that the value of β(x) does not depend on the choice of norms on E
and V ; it depends only on the kernel Nx := ker x and of course on ∆. The
standard Dirichlet-pigeonhole argument outlined in the introduction shows
that

β(x) ≥ max{0,

dim V − dim E

dim E

}

for all x. Given a probability measure ν on Hom(V, E) our goal is to deter-
mine β(x) when x is chosen at random according to ν.
2.1. The Dani correspondence. Given x ∈ Hom(V, E), let Nx := ker x
and Mx be the orthogonal complement of Nx in V . We have

V = Nx ⊕ Mx.

For t > 0, let gx
t be the linear automorphism of V which is a homothety of
ratio e−t/nx on the kernel Nx (nx := dim Nx) and a homothety of ratio et/mx
on the complement Mx (mx := dim Mx). Let Ω be the space of lattices in
V with the same covolume as ∆ in V . Let Ωε be the subset of lattices in
Ω containing a non-zero vector of norm at most ε. This set Ωε is thought
of as “the cusp” of Ω, i.e. as ε → 0 these sets form a nested sequence of
neighborhoods of inﬁnity. This fact is known as Malher’s criterion [Rag72,
Cor. 10.9].

We will study the rate of escape of the orbit {gx

t ∆}t>0 to the cusp:

γ(x) = inf{γ > 0; gx

It is easy to check that γ(x) ≤ 1
diophantine exponent β(x) is deﬁned by:

nx

t ∆ /∈ Ωe−γt for all suﬃciently large t}.

(2.2)
for all x ∈ Hom(V, E). Recall that the

β(x) = inf{β > 0;kxvk > kvk−β for all but ﬁnitely many v ∈ ∆}.

(2.3)

DIOPHANTINE APPROXIMATION ON MATRICES AND LIE GROUPS

The two exponents β(x) and γ(x) are closely related. This is an instance of
the Dani correspondence as described in [KM99, Theorem 8.5] in the case
dim E = 1, namely:
Lemma 2.1.1 (Dani correspondence). We have β(x) = +∞ if and only if
γ(x) = 1
nx

. Whereas if β(x) is ﬁnite, then
nx − γ(x)) = 1

β(x)( 1

+ γ(x).

Note that β(x) is an increasing function of γ(x), and that as β(x) varies

in the interval [ nx
mx

, +∞], γ(x) varies in the interval [0, 1

nx

].

Proof. If β(x) = 0, then x is injective, and the lemma is trivial in this case.
So we assume β(x) > 0 and take β ∈ (0, β(x)). For some arbitrarily large
vector v ∈ ∆,
(2.4)
Write v = vN + vM ∈ Nx ⊕ Mx. Since Mx is in bijection with x(V ), there
is a constant Cx > 0, such that 1
Cxkx(v)k ≤ kvMk ≤ Cxkx(v)k for all v. In
particular we see from (2.4) that, provided v is large enough, kvNk > kvMk.

2.2. Quantitative non-divergence and the local exponent. We now
want to explain the strategy developed by Kleinbock and Margulis to study
diophantine approximation on manifolds. The results presented in this
subsection already appear in previous papers of Kleinbock such as [Kle10,
Kle08]. However, the setting chosen here is slightly diﬀerent, so we will pro-
vide short proofs, except for the key non-divergence estimate, Theorem 2.2.1,
taken from [Kle08].

Let ν be a Borel measure on a metric space X. Given an open set U ⊂ X,
the measure ν is D-doubling (or D-Federer ) on U if every ball B centered
at x ∈ U ∩ Supp(ν) and contained in U satisﬁes
D ν(B),

(2.5)

ν( 1

where 1
3 B is the ball centered at the center of B whose radius is a third
of the radius of B. Given two positive constants C and α, we say that a
real-valued function f on X is (C, α)-good on U with respect to the measure
ν if it satisﬁes, for any ball B ⊂ U and any ε > 0,

ν({x ∈ B ; |f (x)| ≤ ε}) ≤ C(cid:18) ε

Therefore,

where kfkν,B = supx∈B∩Supp ν |f (x)|. By convention, we also agree that if f
is identically zero on the support of ν, then it is (C, α)-good with respect to
ν for any values of C and α.

The heart of the Kleinbock-Margulis approach to study diophantine ap-
proximation on manifolds is the following key result, which can be seen as
a Remez-type inequality (See [ABRdS15a, Thm 2.7], [BG73]) for functions
taking values in the space of lattices.
It originates in the work of Mar-
gulis [Mar71] on non-divergence of unipotent ﬂows, which was later greatly
generalized in work of Dani [Dan85] and Kleinbock-Margulis [KM98]. The
following version is borrowed from [Kle08].

Theorem 2.2.1. [Kle08, Theorem 2.2] Let X be a Besicovitch metric space.
Let U ⊂ X be an open subset and ν a Radon measure on U which is D-
doubling on U for some D > 0. Let C, α > 0 be positive constants and
h : U → SLd(R) be a continuous map. Let ρ ∈ (0, 1] and let B = B(z, r),
z ∈ Supp(ν), be an open ball such that B(z, 3dr) is contained in U . Assume
that for each v1, . . . , vk in Zd \ {0}, 1 ≤ k ≤ d,

where w = v1 ∧ v2 ∧ ··· ∧ vk.
Then for every ε ∈ (0, ρ], we have that

• the function x 7→ kh(x)wk is (C, α)-good for ν on B(z, 3dr), and
• if w 6= 0, then supy∈B∩Supp(ν) kh(y)wk > ρk,
ν({x ∈ B; h(x)Zd ∈ Ωε}) ≤ C ′(cid:0) ε

where C ′ > 0 depends only on D, C, α and the Besicovitch constant of X.

ρ(cid:1)αν(B),

Recall here that Ωε is the part of the space of lattices SLd(R)/SLd(Z)
made of lattices admitting a non-zero vector of length at most ε. Recall also
that a metric space X is called Besicovitch if there exists an integer C such
that we have the following property: suppose A ⊂ X and for each a ∈ A
we are given a non-empty open ball Ba centered at a; then there exists a

countable subset A′ ⊂ A such that A ⊂Sa∈A′ Ba and any intersection of C
distinct balls Ba, a ∈ A′, is empty.
In older versions of this non-divergence result the second assumption in-
volved a lower bound of the form ρ. Kleinbock’s observation [Kle08] that
one can relax this assumption to a lower bound ρk is crucial when one wants
to study diophantine exponents of measures that might not be extremal; it
will be essential in the proofs of Theorem 2.2.4 (via Minkowski’s lemma in
Lemma 2.2.7) and of Theorem 3.0.9.
Deﬁnition 2.2.2. Let ν be a Radon measure on Hom(V, E) and x ∈
Supp(ν). We will say that the measure ν is locally good at x if there exists
a neighborhood Bx of x and positive constants C, D and α such that

• the rank of the matrix is constant on Bx ∩ Supp ν
• ν is D-doubling on Bx
• for all t > 0, all k ≥ 0 and all w = v1 ∧ ··· ∧ vk in ΛkV , the map

sure ν on Hom(V, E), and a point x in its support, we deﬁne its local dio-

We also deﬁne the analogous local notion for the rate of escape:

also a limit as r → 0.
With the quantitative non-divergence result, Theorem 2.2.1, we can derive
the following statements, which are the main facts of this section.

and since xn ∈ Supp(ν) we know from the theorem that β(y) ≤ bβν (xn) for
bβν (xn). So bβν (x) ≤ bβν(xn) + ε as desired.

has a local maximum at every point, must take at most countably many

Suppose now that Supp(ν) is connected.

If x ∈ Supp(ν) then {y ∈

bβν has a local maximum at every point. Hence this set must be all of
Supp(ν), and therefore bβν is constant on Supp(ν). Call this common value
bβν . By deﬁnition of the local exponent, we have bβν(x) ≤ β(x) for every
x ∈ Supp(ν). So bβν ≤ infx∈Supp(ν) β(x). On the other hand β(y) ≤ bβν for

ν-almost every y. Hence the equality.

We now pass to the proof of Theorem 2.2.4. We will denote by W k

∆ the
set of vectors w ∈ ΛkV that can be written w = v1 ∧ ··· ∧ vk where each
vi is an element of ∆. Given a non-negative parameter γ, we say that the
measure ν satisﬁes the condition (Cγ) at x if the following holds:

∀r > 0, ∃c > 0 : ∀k ∈ {1, . . . , dim V }, ∀t > 0, ∀w ∈ W k

γ, if (Cγ) holds for ν at x, then γ(y) ≤ γ for ν-almost all y in B0

Proof. Since ν is locally good at x, we may choose an open ball Bx = B(x, r)

Proof. Let I be the right-hand side above. If γ > I, then (Cγ) holds and
γ(y) ≤ γ for almost every y in the neighborhood B0
x, according to Lemma
2.2.6. It then follows immediately from the deﬁnition of the local exponent
that bγν(x) ≤ γ. So bγν (x) ≤ I. For the converse inequality, note that if

γ < I, then (Cγ) fails to hold, and thus there is r > 0 such that (2.7) holds
for all y ∈ B(x, r) ∩ Supp(ν). By Lemma 2.2.7 γ(y) ≥ γ for all such y.

Proof of Theorem 2.2.4. Note ﬁrst that the second assertion about the lo-
cal maximum is a formal consequence of the ﬁrst. We prove the analogous
inequality for the rate of escape instead of the diophantine exponent. This
is equivalent of course, because of Lemma 2.1.1 and the fact that the rank is
locally constant. The theorem follows easily from Lemma 2.2.6 and Propo-
sition 2.2.8.
Indeed, for every γ > bγν (x), Proposition 2.2.8 tells us that
(Cγ) holds and thus Lemma 2.2.6 gives us a neighborhood B0
x of x such that

γ(y) ≤ γ for almost every y in the neighborhood B0
x is independent
of the choice of γ. So we may take γ = bγν(x) + 1

γ(y) ≤bγν(x).

3. Inheritance from Pl¨ucker closure

As before, E and V denote two real vector spaces. The measure ν is a
measure on Hom(V, E) that is locally good at x (Deﬁnition 2.2.2). One of

More precisely, suppose S ⊂ Hom(V, E) is such that all x ∈ S have the
same rank. Say for each x ∈ S, dim Nx = n, where Nx = ker x as before.
Then, we deﬁne the Pl¨ucker span Hs(S) of S by

(3.1)
Observe that Hs(S) depends only on the Zariski closure Zar(S) of S in
if S′ is the set of elements of maximal rank in the Zariski

Hs(S) = span{ΛnNx; x ∈ S} ≤ ΛnV.

3.1. The condition (Cγ) and proof of Theorem 3.0.9. We proceed with
the proof of Theorem 3.0.9. Recall from Section 2 that the local diophantine

exponent bβν(x) is given in terms of the local escape ratebγν(x) by means of
a simple formula (2.6). So we will concentrate on bγν(x), because for it we

proved (see (2.8)) that

bγν(x) = inf{γ > 0| ν satisﬁes (Cγ) at x}.

We now recall the meaning of the condition (Cγ). Our goal will be to prove
that this condition depends only on Hs
ν(x), and this will establish the theo-
rem.

(3.2)

Suppose S ⊂ Hom(V, E) is such that all x ∈ S have rank m (and n +
m = dim V ). Recall that gx
is the linear automorphism of V which is a
t
homothety of ratio e−t/n on the kernel Nx and a homothety of ratio et/m
on the complement Mx. Also recall that W k
∆ is the set of pure k-vectors
v1 ∧ . . . ∧ vk, with each vi in the lattice ∆ ≤ V . We say that condition
(Cγ(S)) holds if:

With this deﬁnition, we see that a Radon measure ν on Hom(V, E) satisﬁes
(Cγ) at a point x if and only if (Cγ(B(x, r) ∩ Supp ν)) holds for every r > 0.
From the discussion above, the proof of Theorem 3.0.9 will be completed,
once we establish:
Proposition 3.1.1. Let m ≤ dim E and let S, S′ be subsets of elements
of rank m in Hom(V, E) and assume that Hs(S) ⊂ Hs(S′). Then for any
γ ≥ 0, (Cγ(S)) implies (Cγ(S′)).
Proof of Theorem 3.0.9. Note that there is δx > 0 such that Hs

3.2. Facts about exterior algebra. We prove Proposition 3.1.1 in the
next subsection. The proof will be transparent once we reformulate condi-
tion (Cγ(S)) appropriately. For this we ﬁrst pause to recall some standard
material regarding exterior algebras.

Duality. Let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional real vector space. Recall that Λdim V V
is one-dimensional. For each k ≤ dim V , we have a natural bilinear map

ΛkV × Λdim V −kV → Λdim V V
7→ u ∧ w

(u, w)

(3.3)

which is non-degenerate. This means that if u ∈ ΛkV and u∧Λdim V −kV = 0,
then u = 0, and symmetrically. Since dim Λdim V V = 1, the choice of any
non-zero element in Λdim V V deﬁnes, via this map, an isomorphism between
the dual (ΛkV )∗ of ΛkV and Λdim V −kV , so

(ΛkV )∗ ≃ Λdim V −kV.

We also recall that (ΛkV )∗ is naturally isomorphic to ΛkV ∗, and that for
f1, . . . , fk ∈ V ∗ and v1, . . . , vk ∈ V , we have

hf1 ∧ . . . ∧ fk, v1 ∧ . . . ∧ vki = det(fi(vj))ij

(3.4)

Interior product. Classically, one deﬁnes the interior product on the exterior
algebra as follows. Given f ∈ V ∗ and w ∈ ΛkV we deﬁne i(f )w ∈ Λk−1V
to be the unique vector such that, for every θ ∈ (Λk−1V )∗,

If p > k, then i(f )w = 0 by convention.

We refer the reader to [Bou07, Chapitre III] for more on exterior algebras

and interior products.

Flag associated to a subspace or an n-vector. Let N be a subspace of V
and n = dim N . There is a natural ﬂag of ΛkV associated with N . For
j = 0, ..., k, let

(ΛkV )N,j := {w ∈ ΛkV ;∀f ∈ Λk−j−1V ∗, i(f )(ΛnN ) ∧ w = 0}.

The subspace (ΛkV )N,j can also be interpreted as follows. Let M be a
supplementary subspace of N in V , i.e. V = N ⊕ M . Then we have the
decomposition:

ΛkV = ΛkN ⊕ (Λk−1N ⊗ Λ1M ) ⊕ . . . ⊕ (Λ1N ⊗ Λk−1M ) ⊕ ΛkM

and then we check that

(ΛkV )N,j = ΛkN ⊕ (Λk−1N ⊗ Λ1M ) ⊕ . . . ⊕ (Λk−jN ⊗ ΛjM ).

(3.6)
Therefore (ΛkV )N,j can be thought of as the subspace of k-vectors with at
least k − j components in N . Note that it is independent of the choice of
the supplementary subspace M . Clearly

(ΛkV )N,0 = ΛkN ≤ . . . ≤ (ΛkV )N,k = ΛkV.

A lemma on interior products. The following observation is useful:

Lemma 3.2.1. Let k, n, m be non-negative integers, u be an n-vector, w be
a k-vector. The following are equivalent:
(1) w ∧ i(f )u = 0 for all f ∈ ΛmV ∗.
(2) i(f )w ∧ u = 0 for all f ∈ ΛmV ∗.

Proof. We make use of the following fact: every k-vector w can be written as
a linear combination of vectors of the form v∧i(f )w for v varying in V and f
varying in V ∗. This fact can be seen as follows: the map (v, f ) → v ∧ i(f )w
is bilinear and hence deﬁnes a linear map from V ⊗ V ∗ to Hom(ΛkV ). But
V ⊗ V ∗ is canonically isomorphic to Hom(V ), and we thus have a linear map

16

M. AKA, E. BREUILLARD, L. ROSENZWEIG, N. DE SAXC´E

from Hom(V ) to Hom(ΛkV ) and the image of A ∈ Hom(V ) acts on ΛkV as
follows:

A · (v1 ∧ . . . ∧ vk) =

v1 ∧ . . . ∧ A(vi) ∧ . . . ∧ vk

kX1

as one veriﬁes on rank one endomorphisms of the form A = v ⊗ f . Now if
A = IdV is the identity, we get A · w = kw, hence w = 1
k A · w as desired.
We now observe, iterating the above, that given any m ≥ 1, every k-vector
w can be written as a linear combination of terms of the form v ∧ i(f )w for
v varying in ΛmV and f varying in ΛmV ∗.

Since i is an antiderivation, we have

i(f )(w ∧ u) = i(f )w ∧ u + (−1)deg ww ∧ i(f )u.

(3.7)
Now assume that (1) holds, i.e. w ∧ i(f )u = 0 for all f ∈ ΛmV ∗. Then by
the above remarks there are elements fi ∈ ΛmV ∗ and vi ∈ ΛmV such that
u = Pi vi ∧ i(fi)u. And it follows that w ∧ u = 0. Hence from (3.7) we
obtain i(f )w ∧ u = 0 for all f ∈ ΛmV ∗ as desired.

(cid:3)

As a direct consequence of this lemma, we can rewrite (ΛkV )N,j as
(ΛkV )N,j := {w ∈ ΛkV ;∀f ∈ Λk−j−1V ∗, ΛnN ∧ i(f )(w) = 0}.

Proof of Proposition 3.1.1. It is immediate from the combination of the above
two lemmas.
(cid:3)

We now prove Lemma 3.3.2, thus completing the proofs of Proposition
3.1.1 and Theorem 3.0.9. Given x ∈ Hom(V, E) of rank m, the direct sum
V = Nx ⊕ Mx, induces the orthogonal decomposition:

ΛkV =

(ΛkV )k−i,i,

(3.11)

min(m,k)Mi=0

where (ΛkV )k−i,i = Λk−iNx ⊗ ΛiMx. The ﬂow gx
t , which we deﬁned on V
t v = et/mv if v ∈ Mx, extends naturally
by gx
to ΛkV , and the above is an eigenspace decomposition: the eigenvalue on
(ΛkV )k−i,i is etλi,k , where

semi-norm. Moreover, every semi-norm is comparable up to multiplicative
constants to the distance to its kernel. Here the semi-norm N S

This ends the proof of Lemma 3.3.2.

3.4. Pl¨ucker span and Pl¨ucker closure. In this paragraph we deﬁne the
Pl¨ucker closure and show that it is in one-to-one correspondence with the
Pl¨ucker span.

Deﬁnition 3.4.1 (Generalized pencil). Given two integers r ≤ k ≤ dim V
and w ∈ ΛkV , the subset:

Pw,r := {x ∈ Hom(V, E)| w ∈ Lk

x,r}

is called a generalized pencil.

18

M. AKA, E. BREUILLARD, L. ROSENZWEIG, N. DE SAXC´E

When w is a pure vector, i.e. if w = v1 ∧ . . . ∧ vk for some vectors vi in
V , then Pw,r is the pencil PW,r deﬁned in the introduction (cf. Deﬁnition
1.1) with W the span of all vi. In general Pw,r is described by the following
lemma:
Lemma 3.4.2. Given w ∈ ΛkV , the generalized pencil Pw,r is the set of
x ∈ Hom(V, E) such that x(i(f )w) = 0 for every f ∈ Λk−r−1V ∗, where x
acts on Λ∗V by the exterior representation. In particular Pw,r is a closed
algebraic subset of Hom(V, E).
Proof. If k = r + 1 and w ∈ ΛkV , then x(w) = 0 if and only if w ∈
(ΛkV )Nx,k−1 = Lk
x,r. So the lemma follows immediately from Lemma 3.2.1.
(cid:3)

More precisely, we get:

Lemma 3.4.3. Given a compact subset Y of Hom(V, E) made of linear
maps of constant rank, there is C > 0 such that for every r ≤ k − 1, every
w ∈ ΛkV of norm 1, and every x ∈ Y ,

N x
r (w) ≤ max{kx(i(f )w)k; f ∈ Λk−r−1V ∗,kfk = 1} ≤ CN x

r (w).

Proof. Note that both the left and right hand side are semi-norms in w ∈
ΛkV , and Lemma 3.4.2 tells us that their kernel coincides with Lk
x,r. So
they both are comparable up to multiplicative constants with the Euclidean

The local Pl¨ucker closure of a measure ν at x is deﬁned as the intersection
of all H(B(x, r)∩ Supp ν), r > 0, where B(x, r) is the ball at x of radius r in
Hom(V, E). The Pl¨ucker closure and the Pl¨ucker span are closely related:
Lemma 3.4.5. Let S ⊂ Hom(V, E) be made of elements of constant rank,
say m. Then the Pl¨ucker closure H(S) and the Pl¨ucker span Hs(S) deter-
mine one another. In fact

Hs(S) = Hs(H(S)m),

where H(S)m are the elements of rank m in H(S).
Proof. Let n = dim V − m. Given w ∈ ΛkV and r < k, the generalized
pencil Pw,r contains S if and only if, for all x in S and all f in Λk−r−1V ∗,
i(f )Λn ker x ∧ w = 0. This holds if and only if, for all f in Λk−r−1V ∗,
i(f )Hs(S) ∧ w = 0. By deﬁnition, x ∈ H(S) if and only if, for each such w
and r, i(f )Λn ker x ∧ w = 0. Therefore Hs(S) determines H(S).
Conversely, H(S) determines Hs(S), because Hs(S) = Hs(H(S)m). To
prove this equality, note that if x has rank m it belongs to the generalized
pencil Pw,m−1 with w ∈ ΛmV , if and only if Λn ker x ∧ w = 0. Since
n + m = dim V , this equation deﬁnes by duality a single hyperplane in ΛnV ,
and all hyperplanes are of this form. We may write Hs(S) as an intersection

of such hyperplanes and thus conclude that Hs(S) contains the Pl¨ucker span
of H(S)m. The other inclusion is clear, because S ⊂ H(S)m.

4. Locally good measures

Our purpose here is to adapt the paper of Kleinbock-Lindenstrauss-Weiss
[KLW04b] to the setting of diophantine approximation in matrices and to
give a natural geometric criterion on the measure ν, which we call Schubert-
decay and which guarantees the locally good property and the existence of
an almost sure diophantine exponent. Later in the section we prove Theorem
1.4.

4.1. The decay conditions. Recall E and V are two ﬁnite-dimensional
real vector spaces and ν is a Radon measure on Hom(V, E). Assume that
x ∈ Supp(ν) and that ν is doubling on some neighborhood of x (cf. (2.5)).
Let m = rk x and assume that the rank is constant in a neighborhood of x
in Supp(ν).

Deﬁnition 4.1.1. We say that ν is Schubert-decaying at x (resp. Pl¨ucker-
decaying at x) if there exist a neighborhood Ux of x, an integer m such that
rk y = m for all y ∈ Supp ν ∩ Ux, and positive constants C, α, such that for
all k = 1, . . . , dim V , and every pure vector w ∈ ΛkV (resp. every w ∈ ΛkV )
the function y 7→ ky(w)k is (C, α)-good on Ux.

Observe that the set of x where ν is Schubert-decaying (resp. Pl¨ucker-

decaying) is an open subset of Supp(ν).
Theorem 4.1.2 (Schubert decay ⇔ locally good). A Radon measure mea-
sure as above is locally good at x if and only if it is Schubert-decaying at
x.

Corollary 4.1.3. Assume that ν is Schubert-decaying at every point of
Supp(ν), and that Supp(ν) is connected. Then for ν-almost every x,

β(x) = min

y∈Supp(ν)

β(y).

If moreover ν is Pl¨ucker-decaying at every point of Supp(ν), this value de-
pends only on the Pl¨ucker closure of Supp(ν).

We now prove these statements.

Proof of Theorem 4.1.2. With the notation of Subsection 3.3, the decom-
position (3.11) is continuous in x provided the rank remains constant in a
neighborhood of x in Supp ν, which we assume. Thus, up to multiplicative
constants (independent of t > 0, w ∈ ΛkV pure, and of y in a neighborhood
of x),
(4.1)

Moreover Lemma 3.4.3 shows that, up to bounded multiplicative con-
stants, and for all y in a neighborhood of x in Supp ν, we have for any
r = 0, . . . , min{m, k} − 1 and every w ∈ ΛkV :

It is formal that the maximum of ﬁnitely many (C, α)-good non-negative
functions is itself (C, α)-good, and so is any scalar multiple. From this
i−1(w) is (C, α)-good at

observation and (4.1), it follows that if each y 7→ N y
x, then so is y 7→ kgy
For the same reason (4.2) implies that if y 7→ N y
i−1(w) is (C, α)-good at x
for every w ∈ ΛiV (resp. for every pure w ∈ ΛiV ), then so is y 7→ N y
i−1(w)
for all w ∈ ΛkV (resp. for all pure w ∈ ΛkV ). Observe that given a pure
w, although i(f )w is not pure for general f , we may choose ﬁnitely many
pure f so that i(f )w is pure and (4.2) still holds, uniformly in the same
neighborhood of x.

For the same reason (4.2) implies that if y 7→ N y

i−1(w) is (C, α)-good at x
for every w ∈ ΛiV (resp. for every pure w ∈ ΛiV ), then so is y 7→ N y
i−1(w)
for all w ∈ ΛkV (resp. for all pure w ∈ ΛkV ). Observe that given a pure
w, although i(f )w is not pure for general f , we may choose ﬁnitely many
pure f so that i(f )w is pure and (4.2) still holds, uniformly in the same
neighborhood of x.

Therefore in order to prove that ν is (C, α)-good at x, it is enough to
show that all maps y 7→ N y
k−1(w), with pure w ∈ ΛkV and k = 1, . . . m are
(C, α)-good on the same neighborhood of x. But Lemma 3.4.3 implies that
this holds if and only if all maps y 7→ ky(w)k are (C, α)-good on the same
neighborhood of x, i.e. if and only if ν is Schubert-decaying. The converse
is also true, because (4.1) implies

lim

t→+∞

e−λk−1,ktkgy

t wk ≃ N y

k−1(w),

and therefore locally goodness of ν at x implies Schubert-decay of ν at x. (cid:3)

We now prove the following geometric characterization of Schubert-decay:

Proposition 4.1.4 (Geometric criterion for Schubert-decay). A Radon mea-
sure ν on Hom(V, E) supported on maps of rank m, which is locally doubling
at x is Schubert-decaying at x if and only if there is a neighborhood Ux of x
such that for every ball B ⊂ Ux, every ε > 0, and every pencil P
ν(B),

(4.3)

ν(cid:0){y ∈ B; d(y,P) < ε}(cid:1) ≤ C 

supy∈B∩Supp(ν) d(y,P)!α

Here the distance d is some ﬁxed Euclidean distance on Hom(V, E), and
we declare that 1/0 = +∞ in case B ∩ Supp(ν) is contained in the pencil P.
In other words Schubert-decay for a measure ν is equivalent to not charging
too much the neighborhoods of pencils.
Proof. Note that (4.3) means that the functions y 7→ d(y,P) are (C, α)-good
in Ux. Therefore the proposition follows immediately from Lemma 3.4.3 and
Lemma 4.1.5 below.

Lemma 4.1.5. Fix a compact subset Y in Hom(V, E) made of elements of
equal rank m. There exists a constant C ≥ 1 such that for all y ∈ Y , all
pure w ∈ ΛkV \ {0}, and all r = 0, . . . , min{m, k} − 1,

Proof. We may assume that w has norm 1. Fix a basis {fj} of Λk−r−1V ∗.
The functions (y, w) 7→ maxj ky(i(fj )w)k and (y, w) 7→ d(y,Pw,r) are easily
seen to be semi-algebraic. Moreover, they are continuous in y and w, pro-
vided y has ﬁxed rank and w is pure. Moreover Lemma 3.4.2 tells us that
both functions have the same zero set in (y, w). The lemma now follows
from the  Lojasiewicz inequality [BCR98, Corollary 2.6.7].
(cid:3)

Beware that this lemma fails for generalized pencils, because continuity
can fail for d(y,Pw,r) if w is not assumed pure. It is continuous for w pure,
because if w′ is close to w, then there is g ∈ GL(V ) close to the identity
such that gw = w′.

(cid:3)

ν(x) is constant.

By connectedness of Supp ν we only need to check that Hs

Proof of Corollary 4.1.3. The ﬁrst statement is immediate from Theorem
4.1.2 and Corollary 2.2.5. Only the dependence on H(Supp ν) needs to
be justiﬁed. Theorem 3.0.9 tells us that the exponent depends only on
the local Pl¨ucker span Hs
ν(x) at any point x. So it is enough to show
that this local Pl¨ucker span Hs
Indeed, it will then be
equal to Hs(Supp ν) and Lemma 3.4.5 says that Hs(Supp ν) and H(Supp ν)
determine one another.
ν(x) is locally
constant. But this follows immediately from the Pl¨ucker-decaying condition:
if Bx ⊂ Ux is a ball centered at x and Pw,r is a generalized pencil that does
not contain Bx ∩ Supp ν, then the (C, α)-good condition for the map y 7→
maxj ky(i(fj)w)k implies that shows that ν(P ∩ Bx) = 0. However if y ∈ Bx
has Hs
ν(x), then there will be a hyperplane in
ΛnV containing Hs
ν(x). We may take for P the generalized
pencil associated to this hyperplane (cf. proof of Lemma 3.4.5) and get a
contradiction.

4.2. Diophantine exponents of analytic and algebraic subsets. An
important consequence of Theorem 4.1.2 is that the natural Lebesgue mea-
sure on an analytic submanifold of Hom(V, E) is locally good. More pre-
cisely, we have the following.

Proposition 4.2.1 (Lebesgue measure is Pl¨ucker-decaying). Let U be an
open subset of Rd and Φ : U → Hom(V, E) an analytic map. Suppose
that the diﬀerential dΦ has constant rank, and that the rank of the matrix
Φ(u) ∈ Hom(V, E) is also constant. Then the pushforward ν of the Lebesgue
measure on U by the map Φ is Pl¨ucker-decaying at x = Φ(u) for every
u ∈ U .
Proof. Since dΦ has constant rank, it locally looks like a linear map and as
the Lebesgue measure is locally doubling, so is ν. We thus only need to check
that for every u0 ∈ U , all maps u 7→ kΦ(u)(w)k are (C, α)-good in some
neighborhood of u0. Note kΦ(u)(w)k2 is a polynomial in the coordinates
of Φ(u). So the family of functions we consider lies in a ﬁnite-dimensional
family of analytic maps on U . Therefore the conclusion follows from [Kle10,
Proposition 2.1].
(cid:3)

Remark 4.2.2. In the above proposition, the assumption that Φ is analytic
It suﬃces to assume C ℓ regularity and that the partial
can be relaxed.

derivatives span the smallest subspace containing the image. The proof is
the same, except that one uses [KM98, Proposition 3.4] instead.

Recall that an algebraic subset of Hom(V, E) is the set of zeros of a
family of polynomials on Hom(V, E). An algebraic subset is irreducible if it
cannot be written as the union of two proper algebraic subsets. We refer the
reader to [BCR98, Chapter 3] for basic properties of real algebraic subsets
and the deﬁnition of non-singular points. An important consequence of
Proposition 4.2.1 is the following.
Proposition 4.2.3. Let M be an irreducible algebraic subset in Hom(V, E)
of dimension s. Then the s-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure on Hom(V, E)
is Pl¨ucker-decaying at every non-singular point x ∈ M.
Proof. Let x ∈ M be a non-singular point with maximal rank. By the
inverse function theorem for analytic maps, we may take an analytic para-
metrization Φ : Rs → M of M in a neighborhood of x, with Φ(0) = x.
Proposition 4.2.1 then shows that ν, the pushforward by Φ of the Lebesgue
measure on a small ball around 0 in Rs, has the desired properties. This
proves the proposition, because the s-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure on M
is absolutely continuous with respect to ν, with bounded density.

(cid:3)

In the rest of the paper, whenever we are given an algebraic subset of
dimension s in Hom(V, E), we will endow it with the s-dimensional Hausdorﬀ
measure ν restricted to M. For simplicity, we will say that ν is the Lebesgue
measure on M.
Remark 4.2.4. We warn the reader that with our deﬁnitions, if M is a
irreducible subset and ν the Lebesgue measure on M, the support of ν
might be strictly smaller than M. This is the case for example if M is the
Cartan Umbrella, i.e. the subset of R3 deﬁned by z(x2 + y2) − x3 = 0, see
[BCR98, Example 3.1.2 (d), page 60].

As an application of Theorem 3.0.9, we can show that any irreducible

algebraic subset in Hom(V, E) admits a diophantine exponent.
Proposition 4.2.5 (The exponent of an algebraic subset). Let M be an
irreducible algebraic subset in Hom(V, E) and ν the Lebesgue measure on M.

Proof. By Proposition 4.2.3 and Theorem 4.1.2, the measure ν is locally good
at every non-singular point x. Theorem 3.0.9 shows that the local exponent
ν(x). Since x has a connected

Then there exists bβ(M) such that for ν-almost every x ∈ M, β(x) = bβ(M).
Moreover, bβ(M) depends only on the Pl¨ucker closure H(M).
bβν (x) depends only on the local Pl¨ucker span Hs
neighborhood made of non-singular points, the local exponent bβν (x) also
coincides with the almost sure value of β(y), according to Corollary 2.2.5.
Therefore it is enough to show that Hs
ν(x) is independent of the choice of
x and depends only on H(M). Or equivalently, in view of Lemma 3.4.5,
that the local Pl¨ucker closure is independent of x and equals H(M). But,
given that M is assumed to be irreducible, this is immediate from the fact
that neighborhoods of non-singular points are Zariski-dense in M [BCR98,
Proposition 3.3.14].

Proof of Theorem 1.4. The proof is entirely analogous to the previous one.
(cid:3)

5. Pencils and extremality

In this section, we prove Theorem 1.5, giving an upper bound on the dio-

in terms of the pencils containing it. We will see later, in Section 6, that

phantine exponent bβ(M) of an irreducible algebraic subset M ⊂ Hom(V, E)
this upper bound actually coincides with bβ(M) in the case M is deﬁned

over the rationals. We also show how this can be used to recover examples
worked out by Kleinbock, Margulis and Wang in [KMW10].

5.1. The extremality condition. As above V and E are ﬁnite-dimensional
real vector spaces and ∆ is a lattice in V . If S is a subset of Hom(V, E) and
W ≤ V a subspace, we set

rW (S) := min{r ∈ N| S ⊂ PW,r}

where PW,r is the pencil deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1.1.
We also set

When the set S is clear from the context, we shorten the notation to rW .

τ (S) = max{

dim W

rW

; W ≤ V }.

(5.1)

By convention, if for some non-zero W , we have rW = 0, we write τ (M) =
∞. But most of the results from this section are empty in this case. Note
that τ (S) = τ (M) if M is the Zariski closure of S. The lower bound in
Theorem 1.5 follows easily from the Dirichlet pigeonhole principle as outlined
in the introduction. So in view of Theorem 1.4 and Proposition 4.2.5 the
proof of the upper bound in Theorem 1.5 reduces to the following statement:
Theorem 5.1.1 (Upper bound on the exponent). Let M be an irreducible
algebraic subset in Hom(V, E). Then

bβ(M) ≤ τ (M) − 1.

τ (M)

Proof. We ﬁx a non-singular point x ∈ M with maximal rank m and let ν
be the Lebesgue measure on M (see previous section) on a neighborhood of
x. Let n = dim V − m and deﬁne γ ∈ [0, 1
n ] by

We use the notation of §2.2 and check that the measure ν satisﬁes condition
(Cγ) at x. Let Bx be a small neighborhood of x, let y ∈ Bx ∩ M and
w = v1 ∧ ··· ∧ vk a non-zero pure vector in ΛkV . For any t > 0, we have

In particular, condition (Cγ) is satisﬁed at x. By Proposition 2.2.8, this

implies thatbγν (x) ≤ γ and therefore, by Lemma 2.1.1,

bβ(M) ≤ τ (M) − 1.

(cid:3)

We now illustrate this result in a few examples.

Example 5.1.2 (The exponent of a pencil). Given a pencil PW,r, it is
natural to ask what its diophantine exponent might be. It is an interesting
problem to determine this exponent only in deterministic terms, i.e.
in
terms of the quality of approximation of W and its subspaces by rational
subspaces. From Theorem 5.1.1 we can give a general upper bound. Indeed,
it is an exercise in linear algebra to check that

τ (PW,r) = max{

dim W

r

,

dim V
dim E }.

Example 5.1.3 (Weak non-planarity and extremality). A measure ν on
Hom(V, E) will be said to be weakly non-planar at x if the local Pl¨ucker
closure of ν at x is all of Hom(V, E) (see §3.4). This notion was intro-
duced, using slightly diﬀerent words, by Beresnevich, Kleinbock and Mar-
gulis [BKM15] who showed that every locally good weakly non-planar mea-
sure on Hom(V, E) is extremal. The converse however does not hold, and
we now provide an example.

Let k ≥ 4 be an integer and X = (R3)k. Consider the ﬁnite-dimensional

space V of polynomial maps f from X to E = R3 given by

f (u1, . . . , uk) = X1≤i<j≤k

aijui ∧ uj

where ∧ is the usual wedge product in R3 and aij ∈ R. Let M be the Zariski
closure in Hom(V, E) of the image of X by the map Φ : x 7→ (f 7→ f (x)).
Let W be the subspace of V generated by the u1 ∧ uj, j = 2, . . . , k.
For any x = (u1, . . . , uk) with u1 6= 0, the space W (x) is included in the
orthogonal of u1 and hence has dimension at most 2. Therefore, M ⊂ PW,2
is not weakly non-planar.
However, it is easy to see that GLk(R) acts irreducibly on V by substitu-
tion of the variables, so that by Proposition 6.2.3 of the next section, M is
not contained in any constraining pencil and thus M must be extremal.

Example 5.1.4 (A criterion of Kleinbock-Margulis-Wang). The last re-
sult we want to recover by means of Theorem 5.1.1 is a criterion due to
Kleinbock, Margulis and Wang [KMW10, Theorem 7.1(b)] for extremality
for measures on two-by-two matrices. Following their terminology, we say
that an algebraic subset M ⊂ M2,2(R) is row-nonplanar if for all non-zero
v ∈ R2, the map M 7→ M v is not constant on M.
Theorem 5.1.5. [KMW10, Theorem 7.1 (b)] Let M be an algebraic subset
in M2,2(R) and assume that both M and its image tM under the transpose
map are row-nonplanar. Then the submanifold

is extremal.

fM = {(I2|M ) ; M ∈ M} ⊂ M2,4(R)

subspace W < V = R4, there exists a point x ∈ fM such that dim x(W ) ≥
Since M is row-nonplanar, there exists x ∈ fM such that x(W ) is non-
zero, which implies dim x(W ) ≥ 1 ≥ dim W
. Now if dim W = 3, denote by
v1, . . . , v4 the coordinates in V , and suppose ﬁrst that W is given by an
equation v1 = λ2v2 + λ3v3 + λ4v4. The matrix of the restriction of (I2|M )
to W is given in some basis by

where M =(cid:18)a b

c d(cid:19). We have to show that all three columns are not always

proportional. The minors corresponding to the pairs of columns (1, 2) and
(1, 3) are d12 = cλ2 − a − λ3 and d13 = dλ2 − b − λ4, i.e.

Since the image of M under the transposition is row-nonplanar, d12 and
dim x(W ) = 2. The remaining cases, where W is deﬁned by v2 = λ3v3+λ4v4,
v3 = λ4v4 or v4 = 0 are treated similarly.

Example 5.1.6 (Every submanifold is extremal for a random lattice). The
upper bound in Theorem 5.1.1 can be strict. Of course, if the maximum
in τ (M) is attained on a ∆-rational subspace, then this upper bound is
family of examples illustrating this fact. Note that the deﬁnition of τ (M)
is independent of the lattice ∆, whereas it is likely that varying the lattice

every x ∈ M, βg∆0(x) = dim V −m
for almost every g ∈ SL(V ). Indeed, the
set of pairs (x, g) ∈ M × SL(V ), for which βg∆0(x) = dim V −m

Fix x ∈ M such that rk x = m (this happens for x in a Zariski dense
open subset of M and hence for almost every x in M.) Consider the map

the pushforward νx of the Haar measure on a neighborhood U of some
g0 by the map φx is locally good. Let Mx be the Zariski closure of the

suppose W is a subspace of V . Since rk x = m, we may choose g ∈ SL(V )
such that dim(xg−1)(W ) = min{m, dim W}. This shows that τ (Mx) =
m . Moreover, equality is attained for W = V , which is ∆0-rational, so
Theorem 5.1.1 shows that for almost every y in Mx, β∆0(y) = dim V −m

particular, for almost every g in U ,

dim W − r ≤ dim V − dim E). Indeed, bβg∆0(PW,r) = bβ∆0(PgW,r).

6. The submodularity lemma

In view of the results of the preceding section, the following question is
natural: under what condition on the irreducible algebraic subset M ⊂
Hom(V, E) is the maximum deﬁning τ (M) in (5.1) attained on a ∆-rational
subspace W ? We will show here that a suﬃcient condition is that M be
deﬁned over the rationals. This is the content of Theorem 6.2.1. The method
will show more generally that if M is invariant under some group G of
linear automorphisms, then τ (M) is attained on a G-invariant subspace W .
This observation will be essential for the application to nilpotent Lie groups
developed in Sections 9 and 10.

6.1. Statement and proof of the submodularity lemma. Let V be a
ﬁnite-dimensional vector space over an arbitrary ﬁeld and φ : Grass(V ) →
N ∪ {0} a function that is non-decreasing for set inclusion and submodular
in the sense that for any two vector subspaces U and W we have

Lemma 6.1.1 (Submodularity lemma). Let G be a group acting on the
Grassmannian Grass(V ) in a dimension preserving way and suppose that φ
is invariant under G. Then the maximum

is attained on a G-invariant subspace. (By convention, we agree that the
quotient takes the value ∞ if φ(W ) = 0.)

Before we prove Lemma 6.1.1, we make the observation that for every

linear subspace W ≤ V ,
(6.1)
where [W ] is the sum of the subspaces W ′ containing W and such that
φ(W ′) = φ(W ). This follows immediately from the monotonicity and the
submodularity of φ.

φ(W ) = φ([W ]),

Proof of Lemma 6.1.1. For i = 0, . . . , dim V , let

ki = max

W ≤V{dim W ; φ(W ) ≤ i}.

Of course,

φ(W )
is ∞ if φ(W ) = 0 for some non-zero W and 0
is bounded above by

a ratio dim(W )/φ(W ) for some G-invariant non-zero subspace W .
j = 0
If φ(W ) 6= 0 whenever W in non-zero, we can just take W = V . Otherwise,
there is a non-zero W with φ(W ) = 0. For all g ∈ G, we have φ(W + gW ) =
0 because 0 ≤ φ(W + gW ) ≤ φ(W ) + φ(gW ) = 0. Therefore the span
W := hG· Wi of all gW , g ∈ G, has φ(W ) = 0. Since W is G-invariant, this
gives what we want.
(j − 1) → j
We assume that the result has been shown up to the index j − 1, and will
prove it for j. Note that we may assume that

(6.2)

for each i = 0, . . . , j − 1, because otherwise there is nothing to prove. In
particular, kj 6= 0, and hence there is a nontrivial subspace W with φ(W ) ≤
j and dim W = kj. We claim that there is an integer k ≥ 1 and group
elements g1, . . . , gk such that if we denote for each i = 1, . . . , k

W0 = 0, Wi = Wi−1 + giW,

then φ(Wi) > φ(Wi−1) and φ(Wk) = φ(W ), where W is the span of all gW ,
g ∈ G. Indeed, assuming the gi have been constructed up to some index m, if
φ(Wm) < φ(W ), we may ﬁnd some gm+1 ∈ G such that φ(Wm + gm+1W ) >
φ(Wm) using (6.1). This allows one to construct the gi inductively.
Now, for each integer ℓ ≥ 1, we let νℓ be the number of indices i ∈

{1, . . . , k} such that φ(Wi) = φ(Wi−1) + ℓ, and observe that

φ(W ) =Xℓ≥1

νℓℓ.

On the other hand, if φ(Wi) = φ(Wi−1) + ℓ, we have, by submodularity and
G-invariance of φ,

φ(Wi) + φ(giW ∩ Wi−1) ≤ φ(Wi−1) + φ(W )

hence

which entails, by deﬁnition of kj−ℓ, that

φ(giW ∩ Wi−1) ≤ φ(W ) − ℓ ≤ j − ℓ

This means that

dim(giW ∩ Wi−1) ≤ kj−ℓ.

dim Wi ≥ dim W + dim Wi−1 − kj−ℓ = kj − kj−ℓ + dim Wi−1.

Summing this up, we get

dim W ≥ dim Wk =

6.2. Applications of the submodularity lemma. The lattice ∆ deter-
mines a rational structure on V . Assume that we are also given a rational
structure on E, and hence also on Hom(V, E) ≃ V ∗ ⊗ E. We say that an
algebraic subset M in Hom(V, E) is deﬁned over Q if it is the zero set of a
family of polynomials with rational coeﬃcients.

is an irreducible algebraic subset in Hom(V, E) deﬁned over Q. Then

where τ (M) = max{ dim W
Proof of Theorem 6.2.1. By Theorem 5.1.1, all we need to show is that the
maximum τ (M) is attained on a ∆-rational subspace. We deﬁne an integer
valued function φ on the Grassmannian of V C, the complexiﬁcation of V ,
by φ(W ) = maxx∈M dim x(W ). Complexifying V and E, and therefore
Hom(V, E), we have, for any subspace W ≤ V C,
dim x(W ),

φ(W ) = max

Z

is the Zariski closure of M in Hom(V C, EC). The Galois group
where M
G = Gal(C|Q) acts on V , E and Hom(V, E). For σ ∈ G, W ≤ V C and
x ∈ Hom(V, E), we have x(σW ) = σ(σ−1(x)W ) so that dim(σW )(x) =
dim(σ−1(x))(W ). Since M

is by assumption stable under G, we ﬁnd

Z

φ(σW ) = φ(W )

i.e. φ is G-invariant. On the other hand, if U and W are subspaces of V ,
we have, for any x,
dim x(U + W ) + dim x(U ∩ W ) ≤ dim(x(U ) + x(W )) + dim(x(U ) ∩ x(W ))

= dim x(U ) + dim x(W )

so that φ(U + W ) + φ(U ∩ W ) ≤ φ(U ) + φ(W ) and φ is submodular. By
Lemma 6.1.1, this implies that there exists a ∆-rational subspace W0 real-
izing the maximum max06=W ≤V
(cid:3)

dim W
φ(W ) as desired.

Note that modulo Theorem 1.4, this implies immediately Theorem 1.2
from the introduction. More generally, via Corollary 4.1.3, this shows the
following:

Corollary 6.2.2. Let V, E be ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces and ν a Radon
measure on Hom(V, E) with connected support. Assume that ν is Pl¨ucker-
decaying at every point of Supp ν and that the Pl¨ucker closure H(Supp ν) is
deﬁned over Q. Then for ν-almost every x we have:

β(x) = max{

dim W

r

; PW,r ⊃ Supp ν}.

Another useful application of the submodularity Lemma is the following

proposition, which will be crucial in Sections 9 and 10.

Let X denote the k-fold Cartesian product X = Rd×···× Rd. The group
GL(k, R) acts on functions from X to E = Rm by linear substitution of the
variables:

(g · f )(x) = f (g−1x).

The space of polynomial functions from X = Rd × ··· × Rd to E = Rm
is endowed with its canonical Q-structure induced by monomials and the
canonical Q-structures of Rd and Rm. Let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace
of polynomial functions deﬁned over Q and stable under the action of GL(k).
We have a canonical map Φ : X → Hom(V, E), which associates to a point
x the evaluation map v 7→ v(x). With the above setting,
Proposition 6.2.3. For any subspace W ≤ V , let φ(W ) = maxx∈X dim W (x)
and set

τ = max(cid:26) dim W

φ(W )

; W a non-zero rational GL(k, R)-submodule of V(cid:27) .

Then, for Lebesgue almost every x ∈ X,

β(Φ(x)) = τ − 1.

Proof. We may apply Theorem 1.4 to the image of Φ. The almost sure
value of the diophantine exponent depends only on its Zariski closure M,
and the upper bound from Theorem 5.1.1 will be attained provided the
maximum in (5.1) is attained at a rational subspace W . But the Galois
group Gal(C|Q) and the linear group GL(k) both act on V C with commuting
actions. The submodularity lemma (applied to the product group) implies
that this maximum is attained at a rational and GL(k)-invariant subspace.
This ends the proof.
(cid:3)

To conclude, we give one last example where the submodularity lemma
applies, and allows to compute the diophantine exponent of an algebraic
subset of matrices.

Example 6.2.4 (The Veronese curve in algebras). Consider the Veronese
curve V in Rn given by the parametrization x 7→ (x, . . . , xn). The Mahler

30

M. AKA, E. BREUILLARD, L. ROSENZWEIG, N. DE SAXC´E

conjecture proved by Sprind˘zuk says that the curve V is extremal, or in
other words, that for almost every x ∈ R, for all ǫ > 0, the inequality

|v0 + v1x + ··· + vnxn| ≥ kvk−(β+ǫ)

(6.3)

has only ﬁnitely many integer solutions v ∈ Zn+1, where here β = n.
We can consider the analogous problem, where R is replaced by an arbi-
trary ﬁnite-dimensional R-algebra E with unit (e.g. E = Mm(R)). Given
x ∈ E, we may consider integer linear combinations of 1, x, . . . , xn. We may
then ask for the minimal β > 0 such that for almost every x ∈ E and for
every ε > 0, the inequality (6.3) (with a norm in place of the absolute value
on the left hand side) has at most ﬁnitely many integer solutions v ∈ Zn+1.
To ﬁt this problem into our setting, we let V = Rn[X] the space of
polynomials of degree at most n and ∆ the lattice of polynomials with integer
coeﬃcients. Consider the submanifold M of Hom(V, E) which consists of
the evaluations maps P 7→ P (x) for x ∈ E. It is clearly deﬁned over Q and
by Theorem 6.2.1 its exponent, which is exactly the β we are looking for, is
given by τ − 1, where

τ = max(cid:26) dim W

r

; M ⊂ PW,r(cid:27) = max(cid:26) dim W

φ(W )

; M ⊂ PW,r(cid:27) .

Here φ(W ) = maxx∈E dim W (x), where W (x) ≤ E is the image of W under
the evaluation map P 7→ P (x). Now, let G be the group of aﬃne transforma-
tions of the real line and let it act on V by substitution of the variable. The
map φ is submodular (as in the proof of Theorem 6.2.1) and G-invariant, so
by Lemma 6.1.1, τ achieves its value on one of the G-invariant subspaces,
which are exactly the subspaces Vi ≤ V , i = 0, . . . , n of polynomials of de-
gree at most i. So in order to ﬁnd τ , let m be the maximal dimension of
one-generator subalgebras R[x] ≤ E, for x ∈ E. Evaluating Vi at an x with
minimal polynomial of degree m, we see that φ(Vi) = i + 1 for i < m. On
the other hand, we always have φ(W ) ≤ m, so we ﬁnd

dim Vi
φ(Vi)

=(cid:26) 1

i+1

if i < m
m if i ≥ m.

This shows that the desired diophantine exponent β is equal to max{0, n+1−m
m }.

7. A zero-one law

We now turn to the problem of diophantine approximation in nilpotent
Lie groups. The purpose of this section is to show the existence of a critical
exponent for any simply connected nilpotent real Lie group (not necessarily
deﬁned over Q). Later, in Sections 8, 9 and 10, we will explain how to
compute this exponent when the group is deﬁned over the rationals.

In this section G denotes an arbitrary connected simply connected nilpo-
tent Lie group endowed with a left-invariant Riemannian metric d. A ﬁnitely
generated subgroup Γ of G will be called β-diophantine if there is a sym-
metric generating set S of Γ and a constant c > 0 such that for every integer
n (recall that Sn denotes the set of products of n elements from S),

min

x∈Sn\{1}

d(x, 1) ≥ c · |Sn|−β.

(7.1)

DIOPHANTINE APPROXIMATION ON MATRICES AND LIE GROUPS

31

It is well-known (Bass-Guivarc’h formula [Bas72, Gui73]) that, within pos-
itive multiplicative constants, |Sn| ≃ nd for some integer d depending on Γ
only. It is not diﬃcult then to verify that if (7.1) holds for some generat-
ing set S, then it will also hold for any other generating set, possibly with
a diﬀerent constant c, but with the same β. We can therefore deﬁne the
diophantine exponent β(Γ) of a ﬁnitely generated subgroup of G by

β(Γ) = inf{β | Γ is β-diophantine}.
We will prove the following version of Theorem 1.10.

Theorem 7.0.5 (Zero-one law). Let G be a simply connected nilpotent Lie
group, whose abelianization has dimension d. Let k ≥ d be an integer.
Given β ≥ 0 the set of k-tuples g = (g1, . . . , gk) generating a group Γg that
is β-diophantine is either null or co-null for the Haar measure on Gk. In

β(Γg) = bβk

particular, there is a number bβk ∈ [0, +∞] such that

for almost every k-tuple g ∈ Gk.
k by rational automorphisms. Let Fk,s be

the free s-step nilpotent Lie algebra on k generators. The group Aut(Fk,s)
If
of linear automorphisms of Fk,s is an algebraic group deﬁned over Q.
α ∈ Aut(Fk,s)(R) and x1, . . . , xk are free generators of Fk,s, then for each
i = 1, . . . , k, we let αi = α(xi) and note that for every r ∈ Fk,s(R):

α(r) = r(α1, . . . , αk)

Let g be an s-step nilpotent real Lie algebra. The group Aut(Fk,s)(R) acts
on k-tuples g

k as follows:

α · (X1, . . . , Xk) = (α1(X1, . . . , Xk), . . . , αk(X1, . . . , Xk)).

Note that this action is algebraic and preserves the measure class of the
k. Moreover, the Radon-Nikodym cocycle c(g, X)
Lebesgue measure on g
is continuous in (g, X) ∈ Aut(Fk,s)(R) × g
In fact there is a natural
epimorphism from Aut(Fk,s)(R) onto GLk(R) and its kernel is unipotent;
the cocycle is independent of X and given by the determinant of the image
of g under this epimorphism.

k.

We are going to show:

Proposition 7.1.1 (Ergodic action by automorphisms). If k ≥ dim g/[g, g],
then the action of Aut(Fk,s)(Q) on g

k is ergodic.

To prove this, we ﬁrst recall:

Lemma 7.1.2. Let G be a real Lie group, H ≤ G a closed subgroup and ν a
quasi-invariant measure on G/H with continuous Radon-Nikodym cocycle.
Then every dense subgroup of G acts ergodically on G/H.
Proof. We need to show that if f ∈ L∞(G/H) is invariant under a dense
subgroup of G, then it is constant almost everywhere. Let c : G × G/H →
(x) = c(g−1, x). Then for
R be the Radon-Nikodym cocycle, i.e.
every continuous and compactly supported function φ on G/H and every
sequence of elements gn ∈ G converging to g ∈ G, the sequence of functions

x 7→ φ(gnx)c(gn, x) is uniformly converging to φ(gx)c(g, x) on G/H.

d(g∗ν)

follows that for every f ∈ L∞(G/H), hgnf, φi := RG/H f (g−1
n x)φ(x)dν(x)
converges to hgf, φi. Therefore, by duality, if f ∈ L∞(G/H) is invariant
under a dense subgroup of G, then for every g ∈ G we have gf = f almost
everywhere. But this implies that f is almost everywhere constant (e.g. see
[BM00, Lemma 1.2]).
(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 7.1.1. The group Aut(Fk,s) is an algebraic group de-
ﬁned over Q. Hence the group of Q-points Aut(Fk,s)(Q) is dense in the
group of R-points Aut(Fk,s)(R) (in this case this can be checked directly
on the reductive part, which is GLk, and the unipotent part). Therefore
k,

measure zero, while the open orbit will be a homogeneous space G/H of
k as quasi-invariant
G := Aut(Fk,s)(R) with Lebesgue measure coming from g
measure. Lemma 7.1.2 then implies that Aut(Fk,s)(Q) acts ergodically.
To see that Aut(Fk,s)(R) admits a Zariski open orbit when k ≥ d, observe
that any two k-tuples X, X′ of points in g
k with the property that their
reductions modulo [g, g] generate g/[g, g] as a vector space must be in the
same orbit of Aut(Fk,s)(R). Indeed, since k ≥ d = dim(g/[g, g]), we can ﬁnd
an element of GLk(R) such that gX and X′ have the same reduction modulo
[g, g]. We can thus assume that X′ − X belongs to [g, g]k. Now, the fact
that the tuple X = (X1, . . . , Xk) generates g modulo [g, g] implies that every
element of [g, g] can be written as α(X1, . . . , Xk) for some α ∈ [Fk,s,Fk,s].
Therefore X′ − X = (α1(X), . . . , αk(X)) for some αi ∈ [Fk,s,Fk,s]. But
every endomorphism of Fk,s of the form xi 7→ xi + αi(x1, . . . , xk) with αi ∈
[Fk,s,Fk,s] is invertible, hence belongs to Aut(Fk,s)(R) as desired.
To ﬁnish, simply note that when k ≥ d, the set of k-tuples X of points
k such that their reduction modulo [g, g] spans g/[g, g] is a non-empty

7.2. Critical exponent of a nilpotent Lie group. We will prove below
Theorem 7.0.5. It will be a consequence of Proposition 7.1.1 and Proposi-
tion 7.2.1 below.
Proposition 7.2.1. Given β ≥ 0, the set of β-diophantine k-tuples in Gk
is Lebesgue measurable and invariant under the action of Aut(Fk,s)(Q).

Recall that two groups Γ and Γ′ are commensurable if their intersection
has ﬁnite-index in both Γ and Γ′. We divide the proof of Proposition 7.2.1
into two lemmas.

Lemma 7.2.2. Let G be a simply connected nilpotent Lie group, and Γ a
ﬁnitely generated subgroup of G. If Γ is β-diophantine, then any subgroup
of G commensurable to Γ is also β-diophantine.
Proof. Let Γ be β-diophantine and Γ′ commensurable to Γ. Then Γ∩ Γ′ has
ﬁnite-index in Γ′ and therefore, there exists a normal subgroup Γ0 < Γ ∩ Γ′
that has ﬁnite-index in Γ′. In particular, for some integer p, any element
γ ∈ Γ′ has γp ∈ Γ0. Moreover, Γ0 is included in Γ, so it is β-diophantine.
Let S and S0 be symmetric generating sets for Γ′ and Γ0, respectively. Since
Γ0 has ﬁnite index in Γ′, there exists a constant C such that for all integer

. Now suppose γ ∈ Γ′ is an element of Sn\{1}. Then

Using that |Sn

d(γ, 1) ≥

d(γp, 1) ≫ |Sn

(cid:3)

Our second lemma is as follows.

Lemma 7.2.3. Let X := (X1, . . . , Xk) ∈ g
X′ := α(X) ∈ g
commensurable to the subgroup generated by eX ′

k, let α ∈ Aut(Fk,s)(Q) and set
k. Then the subgroup of G generated by eX1, . . . , eXk is

1, . . . , eX ′
k .

Proof. Recall that if γ1, . . . , γk generate a nilpotent group, then for every
integer n ≥ 1, the subgroup generated by the powers γn
k has ﬁnite
index [Rag72, Lemma 4.4.]. By assumption, there is an integer N such that
each N X ′
i belongs to Fk,s(Z)(X1, . . . , Xk), that is N X ′
i is an integer linear
combination of commutators in X1, . . . , Xk. However recall [ABRdS15a,
Lemma 3.5.] that there is an integer M such that eM r(X1,...,Xk) belongs to the
subgroup generated by eX1, . . . , eXk for any r ∈ Fk,s(Z). It follows that each
(eX ′
i )M N belongs to the subgroup generated by eX1 , . . . , eXk . Interchanging
X and X′, the lemma follows.
(cid:3)

1 , . . . , γn

Proof of Proposition 7.2.1. It is clear from the deﬁnition that the subset of
elements g such that Γg is β-diophantine is a Borel subset. Now suppose
that g = (g1, . . . , gk) is such that Γg is β-diophantine and let g′ be in
the Aut(Fk,s)(Q)-orbit of g. This means that log(g) and log(g′) are in
′ are
the same Aut(Fk,s)(Q)-orbit. So Lemma 7.2.3 implies that Γg and Γg
commensurable. Since Γg is β-diophantine, it follows from Lemma 7.2.2
that Γg
(cid:3)

′ also is β-diophantine.

Proof of Theorem 7.0.5. In view of Proposition 7.2.1, the set Dβ of k-tuples
such that Γg is β-diophantine is measurable and invariant under the action of
Aut(Fk,s)(Q). Since this action is ergodic by Proposition 7.1.1, we conclude
that Dβ is either null or conull.
If βk denotes the inﬁmum of all β ≥ 0
for which Dβ is conull, then Dβ will be conull when β > βk and null if
β < βk.
(cid:3)

Remark 7.2.4. The property of being diophantine for a k-tuple g does not
depend only on the projection of g on the abelianization of G. It is easy to
construct examples showing that one may have two tuples g and g′ such that
g = g′ modulo [G, G], but Γg is diophantine, while Γg
′ is not diophantine in
G and Γπ(g
′) is not diophantine in G/[G, G] either, where π is the projection
modulo [G, G]. In particular, Aut(Fk,s)(Q) in Proposition 7.2.1 cannot be
replaced by the subgroup GLk(Q).

8. Critical exponent for the Heisenberg group

As an introduction to the next section, we now present an explicit compu-
tation of the critical exponent of the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group. The
method is elementary, using the Borel-Cantelli lemma combined with an
ad-hoc Remez-type inequality for a certain family of quadratic forms (cf.
Lemma 8.0.10 below). The relationship between this elementary method
and the Kleinbock-Margulis type approach developed later in this paper is
brieﬂy discussed at the end of this section.

In this section, G will always denote the 3-dimensional Heisenberg group,
consisting of 3×3 unipotent upper-triangular matrices. It will be convenient
for us to view G as the space R3, endowed with the group law
(x, y, z) ∗ (x′, y′, z′) = (x + x′, y + y′, z + z′ + xy′).

Recall the deﬁnition of the diophantine exponent of a k-tuple of elements of
G, made at the beginning of Section 7. We want to prove the following.

Theorem 8.0.5 (Critical exponent for the Heisenberg group). Let k ≥ 2.
Then for almost every k-tuple g = (g1, . . . , gk) in G,

β(Γg) = 1 −

1
k −

2
k2 .

For the proof of Theorem 8.0.5, we will need a few deﬁnitions. Recall
that if w is a word on k letters, i.e. an element of the free group Fk over k
generators x1, . . . , xk, it induces a word map

wG :

Gk

(g1, . . . , gk)

G

→
7→ w(g1, . . . , gk),

where w(g1, . . . , gk) is the element of G obtained by substituting each letter
xi by the element gi. The group Fk,G of word maps in k letters on G
is deﬁned to be the set of all such maps, with composition law given by
wGw′
G = (ww′)G. The length ℓ(ω) of a word map ω in Fk,G is the minimal
length of a word w such that ω = wG.

In the case of the Heisenberg group, one can describe the group of word
maps very explicitly. For any two elements g and h in G, [g, h] denotes the
commutator of g and h, deﬁned by [g, h] = ghg−1h−1. The subgroup [G, G]
generated by commutators coincides with the center Z of G and is the set
of elements (0, 0, z), for z ∈ R.
Proposition 8.0.6 (Word maps on the Heisenberg group). Let k ≥ 2. For
each word map ω on k letters on G, there exist integers ni, 1 ≤ i ≤ k and
nij, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k such that for all g = (g1, . . . , gk) in Gk,

k Y1≤i<j≤k

ω(g) = gn1

1 . . . gnk

[gi, gj ]nij .

Moreover, the ni and nij are uniquely determined by ω and there exists a
constant C > 0 depending only on k such that

ℓ(ω) ≤ max

DIOPHANTINE APPROXIMATION ON MATRICES AND LIE GROUPS

35

Proof. The existence of the ni and nij is proved by elementary operations
on a word representing ω, using that all commutators lie in the center of G,
because G is 2-step nilpotent. To verify uniqueness, it suﬃces to show that
no non-trivial family of integers ni, nij yields the trivial word map; this can
be checked directly, by expliciting the word maps in the (x, y, z) coordinates
for G. The statement about the length of ω can also be proved directly,
using the identity in G, [gn
j ] = [gi, gj]nm. We leave the details to the
reader.

ℓ(ω)−α for all but ﬁnitely many ω ∈ Fk,G.
ω ∈ Fk,G for which d(ω(g), 1) < ℓ(ω)−α.

We decompose the proof into two lemmas, studying ﬁrst the word maps
ω on G that are non-trivial modulo the center of G, i.e. those for which
some ni is non-zero.

Lemma 8.0.8 (Diophantine property outside of the derived subgroup). Let
k ≥ 2. If α > k
2 − 1, then for almost every k-tuple g, we have d(ω(g), 1) ≥
ℓ(ω)−α for all but ﬁnitely many word maps ω that are non-trivial modulo
the center of G.

Proof. Suppose g = (g1, . . . , gk) is chosen at random in Gk according to the
Haar measure on a compact subset. Then, the projection ¯g = (¯g1, . . . , ¯gk)
to (G/Z)k is a random k-tuple in (G/Z)k ≃ (R2)k, and its law is absolutely
continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. By a standard application
of the Borel-Cantelli lemma, we know that almost surely, if α > k
2 − 1, then

kn1¯g1 + ··· + nk¯gkk ≥ (max|ni|)−α,

for all but ﬁnitely many (n1, . . . , nk) in Zk. This proves the lemma.

(cid:3)

We now need to study word maps that are trivial modulo the center.

Lemma 8.0.9 (Diophantine property inside the derived subgroup). Let
If α > k2 − k − 2, then for almost every k-tuple g, we have
k ≥ 2.
d(ω(g), 1) ≥ ℓ(ω)−α for all but ﬁnitely word maps ω of the form ω : g 7→
Q1≤i<j≤k[gi, gj]nij .
Proof. Let ω : g 7→Q1≤i<j≤k[gi, gj]nij . In the (x, y, z) coordinates, the map

We can now conclude the proofs of Theorems 8.0.7 and 8.0.5.

Proof of Theorem 8.0.7. The ﬁrst assertion follows from combining Lem-
mas 8.0.8 and 8.0.9, noting also that for k ≥ 2, one has k
2 − 1 ≤ k2 − k − 2.
For the second assertion, we note we have k(k − 1)/2 commutators [gi, gj]
lying in Z ≃ R. Therefore, given a positive integer n, Dirichlet’s pigeonhole
argument shows that there exist integers nij, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k such that
|nij| ≤ n2 and

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

nij[gi, gj](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where C is a constant depending only on g. Thus, for the word map ω :

d(ω(g), 1) ≤ Cℓ(ω)−k2+k+2.

(cid:3)

2 = nk2

Proof of Theorem 8.0.5. By Proposition 8.0.6, the number of word maps of
length at most n is bounded above and below by a positive constant times
nk+2 k(k−1)
. However, we know from [ABRdS15a, Lemma 2.5] that,
for almost every k-tuple g, the group Γg is isomorphic to Fk,G, so that, if
Vg(n) denotes the number of elements in the ball of radius n with respect
to the generating set g, there exist positive constants c1, c2 such that

Together with Theorem 8.0.7, this shows that for almost every k-tuple g,

Lemma 8.0.9 is equivalent to saying that the pushforward under ϕ of the
Haar measure on (a ball of) Gk is extremal. So an alternative proof consists
in using the Kleinbock-Margulis theorem: then all one is left to check is that
the image of ϕ is not contained in a hyperplane.

In the next section, this will be our approach to compute the critical
exponent of an arbitrary connected simply connected rational nilpotent Lie
group. We will reduce the problem to studying the extremality of some
maps Gk → G(i)/G(i+1), where G(i) denotes the i-th term of the descending
central series. The fact that the successive quotients G(i)/G(i+1) are not
necessarily one-dimensional will make the analysis more involved than in

the above example. It is also the reason why we had to study extremality
problems in the context of diophantine approximation on matrices, in the
ﬁrst part of the paper.

9. The critical exponent for rational nilpotent Lie groups

In this section we describe a method for computing the critical exponent
for nilpotent Lie groups using the results of the previous sections regarding
submanifolds of matrices. This method allows to compute the exponent
explicitly for a large class of nilpotent groups. We will also prove Theorem
1.11 at the end. In this section G denotes an arbitrary simply connected
nilpotent real Lie group. Its Lie algebra is denoted by g and its nilpotency
class by s.

k }.

9.1. Growth of a generic subgroup and group of words maps. Let
k ≥ 1 and a k-tuple g = (g1, . . . , gk) of elements of G. Recall from the
beginning of Section 7 the notion of β-diophantine k-tuple, or equivalently
β-diophantine subgroup. The deﬁnition of this exponent β involves the
volume Vg(n) = |Sn| of the ball of radius n in the subgroup generated by
S := {1, g±1
It turns out [ABRdS15a, Lemma 2.5] that for a generic k-tuple g (generic
with respect to Haar measure on G) the isomorphism class of the subgroup
Γg = hSi is always the same. It is isomorphic to the group of word maps on k
letters Fk,G of G, introduced in [ABRdS15a]. We brieﬂy recall this notion.
Any element w in the free group Fk on k letters x1, . . . , xk determines a
word map wG : Gk → G given by substituting each letter xi by an element
of G. The group Fk,G is deﬁned to be the set of all such word maps, with
composition law given by wGw′
G = (ww′)G, where ww′ denotes the product
of w and w′ in Fk. It can also be viewed as the relatively free group in the
variety of k-generated subgroups of G.

Since Fk,G is a ﬁxed nilpotent group, the Bass-Guivarc’h formula [Bas72,
Gui73] tells us that up to multiplicative constants, for a generic k-tuple g
in G,

(9.1)
where ηG(k) is a positive integer that can be expressed in terms of the ranks
of the successive quotients of the central descending series of Fk,G, see (9.6)
below.

Vg(n) ≃ nηG(k)

Now given a k-tuple g of elements of G, we can deﬁne another diophantine
exponent, denoted α(g), as follows. It is the inﬁmum of all α > 0 such that
for all but ﬁnitely many ω ∈ Fk,G we have:

(9.2)
where d(·,·) is again a ﬁxed Riemannian metric on G, and ℓ(ω) is the length
the minimal length of a word w such that
of an element ω ∈ Fk,G, i.e.
wG = ω.

d(ω(g), 1) ≥ ℓ(ω)−α,

Now observe that, when k ≥ dim G/[G, G], Theorem 7.0.5, combined with

that for almost every k-tuple g in G

the above remark about Vg(n) implies the existence of bαk ∈ [0, +∞] such

α(g) =bαk,

bαk = ηG(k)bβk.

and moreover

(9.3)

9.2. From words to Lie brackets. In this subsection, we describe the
correspondence between words on G and laws on its Lie algebra g.

We ﬁrst deﬁne the Lie algebra of bracket maps on k letters on g, denoted
Fk,g. Let Fk be the free Lie algebra on k generators. Each element r in Fk
yields a map

r :

k

g

(X1, . . . , Xk)

g

→
7→ r(X1, . . . , Xk)

where r(X1, . . . , Xk) is the evaluation of the formal bracket r at the point
k. By deﬁnition, the Lie algebra Fk,g consists of all maps
(X1, . . . , Xk) in g
k to g obtained in the above manner. It is naturally isomorphic to
from g
the quotient Lie algebra Fk/Lk,g where Lk,g is the ideal of laws on k letters
on the Lie algebra g. Recall that a law on k letters is an element r ∈ Fk
such that r(X1, . . . , Xk) = 0 for all X1, . . . , Xk in g.

The Lie algebra Fk,g has a graded structure
F [i]
k,g,

Fk,g =

sMi=1

k,g is the homogeneous part of Fk,g consisting of brackets of degree

where F [i]

k,g, we let

|r| =

s

max
i=1 krik

i ,

(9.4)

where k · k is the quotient norm on Fk,g induced from some ﬁxed norm on
Fk.
Note that the free Lie algebra Fk has a natural Q-structure induced by
the subring Fk(Z) of integer linear combinations of brackets monomials.
We will assume in this section that g is such that the ideal of laws Lk,g is
deﬁned over Q, or in other words, that it has a basis consisting of elements
of Fk(Z). This yields a natural rational structure of Fk,g. We will say that
r is an element of Fk,g(Z) if it is the projection on Fk,g of an element of
Fk(Z).
Remark 9.2.1. Certainly if g itself is deﬁned over the rationals, then so is
Lk,g, but the converse does not hold. For example, it followed from the
analysis made in [ABRdS15a, Appendix A] that the ideal of laws is always
deﬁned over Q if g is a nilpotent Lie algebra of step at most 5, or if g is both
nilpotent and metabelian.

Lemma 9.2.2. Let g be a real nilpotent Lie algebra with ideal of laws Lk,g
deﬁned over the rationals and G the simply connected Lie group with Lie
algebra g. There are positive integers C, D such that

• If ω ∈ Fk,G, then there exists r ∈ Fk,g(Z) with |r| ≤ Dℓ(ω) such that

for all X1, . . . , Xk in g, ω(eX1, . . . , eXk ) = e

C

r(X1,...,Xk).

• If r ∈ Fk,g(Z), then there exists ω ∈ Fk,G with ℓ(ω) ≤ D|r| and for

all X1, . . . , Xk in g, eC r(X1,...,Xk) = ω(eX1 , . . . , eXk ).

40

M. AKA, E. BREUILLARD, L. ROSENZWEIG, N. DE SAXC´E

Proof. This was proved in [ABRdS15a, Lemma 3.5] for the free Lie algebra
Fk and the free group Fk. The relative version stated here follows without
diﬃculty, using the fact that Fk,g = Fk/Lk,g = ⊕iF [i]
k,g and that Lk,g is

k /L[i]

(cid:3)

deﬁned over Q.

This lemma has the following immediate consequence.

Proposition 9.2.3. Let G be a simply connected nilpotent Lie group, with
Lie algebra g such that Lk,g is deﬁned over Q. Let g = (eX1, . . . , eXk ) be a
k-tuple in G. The exponent α(g) deﬁned in (9.2) is also the inﬁmum of all
α > 0 such that

∀r ∈ Fk,g(Z),

kr(X1, . . . , Xk)k ≥ |r|−α

(9.5)

holds for all but ﬁnitely many r ∈ Fk,g(Z).

It also follows from Lemma 9.2.2 that the Malcev closure (see [Rag72]) of
the group of word maps Fk,G coincides with the simply connected rational
nilpotent Lie group whose Lie algebra is Fk,g (see also [ABRdS15a]). The
Bass-Guivarc’h formula for the growth exponent of Fk,G from (9.1) now
reads:

ηG(k) =

ki dimF [i]
k,g.

(9.6)

sXi=1

Each F [i]
k,g is a module for the action of GLk under linear substitution. We
will see below that, as a consequence, dimF [i]
k,g is a polynomial in k with
rational coeﬃcients and of degree i. It follows that ηG(k) is a polynomial in
Q[X] of degree s. Therefore, in view of (9.3), we will now focus on computing

bαk.
9.3. A formula for the exponent. In order to compute bαk, we need to

solve the diophantine problem described by (9.5). This diophantine problem
is not exactly of the form we have been dealing with in the ﬁrst half of the
paper, because of the multi-homogeneous nature of |r| (deﬁned in (9.4)),
which is not a norm. Nevertheless, for a certain class of nilpotent Lie groups,
and when k ≥ k0, we can reduce to this more classical setting.

if r ∈ Fk,g and r(g

all examples in Section 10. We will show:

Theorem 9.3.1 (Formula for the critical exponent). Let G be a connected
simply connected nilpotent Lie group of nilpotency class s whose Lie algebra
belongs to the class C. Then there is a polynomial P ∈ Q[X] of degree s such

that bαk = P (k) for all k larger than a constant depending only on dim G.

DIOPHANTINE APPROXIMATION ON MATRICES AND LIE GROUPS

Remark 9.3.2 (Carnot-Caratheodory metric). We note that a Riemannian
metric was used in the deﬁnition of the diophantine exponent (1.6), while
another natural choice, for a nilpotent Lie group, would have been a subrie-
mannian left-invariant metric determined by a norm on the abelianization
g/[g, g]. This is not a serious change when k is large in the setting of The-
orem 9.3.1, because the new exponent can be deduced from the old simply
by dividing by s.

9.4. The relatively free Lie algebra as a GLk-module. In order to
prove Theorem 9.3.1 and Theorem 1.11 by means of the results of the previ-
ous sections (in particular Proposition 6.2.3), we need some understanding
of the GLk-submodules of Fk,g. The action of the linear group GLk on the
free Lie algebra Fk on k letters is by substitution of the variables. As it
turns out the decomposition of each homogeneous component F [i]
k into sim-
ple GLk-modules is representation stable in the sense of Church, Ellenberg
and Farb, see [CF13, Corollary 5.7]. This is can be made more precise as
follows:

Proposition 9.4.1. Let G be a step s simply connected nilpotent real Lie
group with Lie algebra g. There is a bijective correspondence between GLk-
submodules of Fk,g, k ≥ s, and GLs-submodules of Fs,g. It sends a submod-
ule W ≤ Fk,g to the submodule Ws ≤ Fs,g obtained by forgetting variables
Xi, i > s, namely by substituting (X1, . . . , Xs, 0, . . . , 0) in each element of
W . Moreover, if W < Fk,g is a GLk-submodule with the following decompo-
sition into irreducible submodules

W =Mλ
Ws =Mλ

Eλ(k)nλ ,

Eλ(s)nλ,

then Ws decomposes, with the same multiplicities, as

(9.7)

where Eλ(k) is the irreducible representation of GLk with Young diagram
λ. The Young diagrams appearing in either decomposition have at most s
boxes. In particular, in the decomposition of Fk,g, as k grows, there are only
boundedly many irreducible GLk-submodules counting multiplicity.
Proof. Note that elements of Fk,g are linear combinations of brackets having
at most s letters. For each set B of at most s letters amongst x1, . . . , xk
consider the subspace VB of Fk,g spanned by the commutators whose set of
letters occurring in them is precisely B. The diﬀerent subspaces VB are in
direct sum, they span Fk,g, and they decompose further into weight spaces
for the diagonal action

(t1, . . . , tk) · c(x1, . . . , xk) := c(t1 x1, . . . , tk xk)

on Fk,g. The weights occurring in VB are of the form (n1, . . . , nk) ∈ Nk,
where ni 6= 0 if and only if xi ∈ B. Now we see that W = ⊕BW ∩ VB.
Observe that for each set B of s letters ⊕B ′⊂BVB ′ is isomorphic to Fs,s and
⊕B ′⊂BW ∩ VB ′ to Ws. Now if W ≤ Fk,g is an irreducible GLk-module,
then it is generated by a highest weight vector, whose weight λ is of the
form (n1, . . . , nk) with ni = 0 if i > s. The corresponding GLs-submodule

42

M. AKA, E. BREUILLARD, L. ROSENZWEIG, N. DE SAXC´E

is precisely Ws and is generated by the same highest weight vector. It is
therefore an irreducible GLs-module with the same Young diagram. The
result follows.
(cid:3)

Given a Young diagram λ, by the Weyl dimension formula, the dimension

dλ(k) of the irreducible GLk-module associated to λ is:

dλ(k) = Y1≤i<j≤k

λi − λj + j − i

j − i

.

In particular, if i is the total number of boxes of λ, then dλ(k) is a polynomial
of degree i in k with rational coeﬃcients. The number of boxes of Eλ ≤
Fk,g is the number of letters appearing in the brackets of the associated
submodule of Fk,g. In particular, we obtain:
Corollary 9.4.2. For i = 1, . . . , s, the map k 7→ dimF [i]
k,g is a polynomial
in k of degree i with rational coeﬃcients. More generally, the dimension of
every GLk-submodule W in Fg,k is given by the value at k of a polynomial
with rational coeﬃcients of degree at most s.

We also note the following consequence of Proposition 9.4.1:

if Ls,g is
deﬁned over Q, then so are all Lk,g for k ≥ s (see also [ABRdS15a, Prop.
5.7]).

Theorem 9.3.1. For r ∈ Fk,g denote by ¯r the residue modulo F [s]

9.5. Proofs of Theorem 9.3.1 and 1.11. We are now ready to prove
k,g. Note
(s). We can apply Proposition 6.2.3 to this
that ¯r induces a map g
(s) and V the space of
situation. Here X is the cartesian product g
polynomials maps spanned by all ¯r as above. Note that V is naturally deﬁned
over Q because of the assumption that Ls,g (and hence also Lk,g) is rational.
Proposition 6.2.3 now says that for almost every choice of X1, . . . , Xk in g
and every ε > 0 we have:

k → g/g

k, E = g/g

k

k¯r(X1, . . . , Xk)k ≥ k¯rk−τk−ε

(9.8)

k,g(Z), where τk is a rational number
given by the formula in Proposition 6.2.3. From this formula, it is clear

for all but ﬁnitely many ¯r ∈ Fk,g/F [s]
k,g. However, in view of Corollary 9.4.2, dimFk,g/F [s]
that τk ≤ dimFk,g/F [s]
is a polynomial of degree at most s − 1 in k with rational coeﬃcients (all
bounded in terms of dim G only, because there are only boundedly many
terms in the decomposition of Fk,g into irreducible submodules). On the
other hand if r ∈ F [s]
(s) and we may again apply
Proposition 6.2.3 to this situation, where this time E is g and V the space
of polynomials maps spanned by F [s]
k,g. As a result for almost every choice of
X1, . . . , Xk in g

k,g, then r(X1, . . . , Xk) ∈ g

kr(X1, . . . , Xk)k ≥ krk−σk−ε,

(9.9)

DIOPHANTINE APPROXIMATION ON MATRICES AND LIE GROUPS

43

where σk is given by the formula in Proposition 6.2.3. According to Propo-
sition 9.4.1 and Corollary 9.4.2 the dimension of GLk-invariant subspaces
of F [s]
k,g can achieve only boundedly many values, each given by a polyno-
mial in k with rational coeﬃcients and degree s. Similarly, the function φ
(s) –
– mapping an invariant submodule to the dimension of its image in g
(s) values. Therefore σk is equal to the maximum
can achieve at most dim g
of boundedly many polynomial functions of k of degree at most s. When
k is large enough (larger than a constant depending only on the size of the
coeﬃcients of these polynomials, hence only on dim g) this maximum will
be achieved by a single polynomial of degree s.
In particular, when k is
large enough σk > τk. As a result we obtain that for almost every choice of
X1, . . . , Xk in g

k and for every ε > 0 and all but ﬁnitely many r ∈ Fk,g

kr(X1, . . . , Xk)k ≥ |r|− bαk−ε,

(9.10)

and that bαk := sσk is optimal for this property. To see this we ﬁrst look
(s). If this is non-zero, then the map
at the value of r(X1, . . . , Xk) modulo g
r does not belong to F [s]
g,k and (9.8) holds, which implies (9.10), because
(s) then (for a
krkτk ≤ |r|sτk ≤ |r| bαk . On the other hand, if r(X1, . . . , Xk) ∈ g
full measure set of Xi’s) r ∈ F [s]
k,g because of our assumption that g is of class
C. Then (9.9) implies (9.10), because krkσk = |r|sσk = |r| bαk . This completes
the proof of Theorem 9.3.1.

Since the growth exponent ηG(k) is a polynomial of degree s in k we

deduce:

Theorem 9.5.1 (Rationality and stability of the exponent). Let g be a
nilpotent Lie algebra of class C, and G be the associated simply connected
real Lie group. Then there exists a rational function Fg = P

deg P = deg Q = s such that

bβk = Fg(k),

We expect this result to hold for all rational nilpotent Lie algebras. But
without the class C assumption the diophantine problem one needs to solve
falls outside the scope of diophantine approximation on submanifolds of
matrices, as one genuinely needs to tackle the inhomogeneous diophantine

problem displayed in (9.5). We also expect bβk to be rational for every k, not

only large k, and there again the same inhomogeneous diophantine problem
arises.

We now pass to the proof of Theorem 1.11. First we justify the existence
and rationality of the limit as k → +∞. Under the assumption of Theorem
we can prove this more generally using the above considerations. Indeed,
for a general g, assuming only that Lg,s is rational (for example if g itself
is rational), then the proof of Theorem 9.3.1 we have just given shows the

9.5.1, this is clear given the fact that bβk is a rational function of k. But

almost surely, for all but ﬁnitely many r ∈ Fk,g(Z)
kr(X1, . . . , Xk)k ≥ krk−δ.

(9.11)

However, as we have seen sσk is, when k is large, the value at k of a poly-
nomial of degree s with rational coeﬃcients. Moreover the value of 1 + δk
is determined again by Proposition 6.2.3 as a maximum of dim W
φ(W ) , where W
ranges over all rational GLk-submodules of Fk,g. Hence δk is also a polyno-
mial of degree s. Its main term must be the same as σk, because it must
come from an invariant submodule belonging to F [s]

In this ﬁnal section, we illustrate Theorems 9.3.1 and 1.11 and work out

an explicit value for the critical exponent bβk in several examples.

10.1. Nilpotent Lie groups of step 2. In this paragraph, G is a connected
simply connected non abelian nilpotent Lie group of step 2. We denote by
di, i = 1, 2 the dimension of g

[i]. Here g
It is easy to check that d2 ≤ d1(d1−1)

[1] = g/[g, g] and g
, and that g is of class C (see the
k,g and F [2]
deﬁnition in §9.3). Moreover, by [ABRdS15a, Appendix A], F [1]
are both irreducible GLk-modules of dimension k and k(k−1)/2 respectively.
The exponent τk deﬁned in (9.8) is therefore equal to 1 + k/d1, while σk,
deﬁned in (9.9) is equal to 1 + k(k − 1)/(2d2). When k ≥ d1 the latter is
d2 − 2, and since
ηG(k) = k + k(k − 1) = k2 according to (9.6) we get:
Theorem 10.1.1 (Step 2 nilpotent Lie groups). Let G be a connected
simply-connected non-abelian nilpotent Lie group of step 2. Set d1 = dim G/[G, G]
and d2 = dim[G, G] and let k ≥ d1 be an integer. The critical exponent for
k-tuples in G is

larger or equal to the former. This implies that bαk = k(k−1)

thus recover the computation made in Section 8.

10.2. Metabelian nilpotent Lie groups. Suppose now, more generally,
that G is a simply connected metabelian nilpotent Lie group, that is we
assume that [G, G] is abelian. This does not constrain the nilpotency class,
and it is shown in [ABRdS15a, §A.3] that F [i]
k,g is irreducible as a GLk-module
for each i and isomorphic to E(i−1,1)(k). For this reason G is always of class
C and we may apply the analysis of Theorem 9.3.1 to it.

In particular, for k large we obtain:

dim E(s−1,1)(k)

− s.

bαk = s

On the other hand, the Bass-Guivarc’h formula reads:

10.3. Unipotent upper triangular matrices. We now deal with the case
of the group Us of upper triangular unipotent (s + 1) × (s + 1) matrices. Its
Lie algebra is the Lie algebra g = us of upper triangular matrices with zero
diagonal, and our ﬁrst task will be to determine, for any positive integer k
the Lie algebra Fk,g of bracket maps on g on k letters. The result is the
following.

Proposition 10.3.1. Let k be a positive integer, and let g = us be the Lie
algebra of upper triangular (s+1)×(s+1) matrices with zero diagonal terms.
The Lie algebra Fk,g of bracket maps on g on k letters is isomorphic to the
free s-step nilpotent Lie algebra Fk,s.

An alternative formulation of Proposition 10.3.1 is in terms of the nilpo-

tent group of unipotent upper triangular matrices:

Corollary 10.3.2. Let Us be the group of upper triangular unipotent (s +
1) × (s + 1) matrices, and let k be any positive integer. Then Us contains
the free nilpotent group of step s on k generators as a ﬁnitely generated
subgroup.
Proof of Proposition 10.3.1. Let k ≥ s be a positive integer and let Fk de-
note the free Lie algebra on the k generators x1, x2, . . . , xk. We have to check
that g = us has no nontrivial relation of degree less than or equal to s in
Fk. First, by the proof of [Bah87, Theorem 3, page 99] we note that if g
satisﬁes a nontrivial relation, then it also satisﬁes a nontrivial multilinear
relation whose degree is not larger. Now, if r is such a multilinear relation
in g, then so is each of its homogeneous components, so we may assume r
has degree one in each xi, 1 ≤ i ≤ t. In fact, we may also assume t = s,

46

M. AKA, E. BREUILLARD, L. ROSENZWEIG, N. DE SAXC´E

otherwise, we replace r by [[r, xt+1], . . . , xs]. So we just have to see that g
has no multilinear relation in s variables.

Let Hs be the vector space of all elements of Fk of degree s that are
multilinear in (x1, x2, . . . , xs). We want to check that the canonical map
θ : Hs → Fk,g is injective. By Witt’s Formula [Hal76, Theorem 11.2.2],

dimHs = (s − 1)!

(10.1)

For σ a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , s} ﬁxing 1, we denote
mσ = [. . . [[x1, xσ(2)], xσ(3)], . . . , xσ(s)].

This gives us a family (mσ) of (s− 1)! elements in Hs. We will show that its
image (θ(mσ)) under θ is linearly independent in Fk,g; together with (10.1),
this will prove the theorem.
For 1 ≤ i, j ≤ s + 1 we denote by Ei,j the matrix whose only non-zero
entry is 1, in position (i, j). For 1 ≤ i ≤ s, we also let ei = Ei,i+1. Using the
relations [Ei,j, Ek,l] = δjkEil, one can compute the values of the θ(mσ) on
permutations of the s-tuple (ei), and get, for any two permutations σ and
τ of {1, 2, . . . , s}, both ﬁxing 1:

θ(mσ)(e1, eτ (2), . . . , eτ (s)) =(cid:26) Es+1,s+1

0

if σ = τ −1
otherwise.

This implies in particular that the family (θ(mσ)) is linearly independent,
so we are done.
(cid:3)

From the Bass-Guivarc’h formula (9.6), and Witt’s formula, we thus com-

pute:

From Proposition 10.3.1, it is not diﬃcult to compute the critical exponent
for the group G = Us of unipotent upper triangular matrices. Indeed, g = us
(s), then [xk+1, r] is a law of g,
is of class C, because if r ∈ Fk is a law of g/g
hence has all its homogeneous components of degree at least s + 1 according
to Proposition 10.3.1. Hence r ∈ F [s]
k .
bαk = dimF [s]

So the analysis of Theorem 9.3.1 applies and gives:
µ(d)ks/d − s.

k =Xd|s

We thus obtain:

Theorem 10.3.3 (Critical exponent for Us). Let Us be the nilpotent group
of unipotent upper triangular (s + 1) × (s + 1) matrices. Then for k large,
the critical exponent for k-tuples in Us is

bβk = Pd|s µ(d)ks/d − s
Pi≤s M ( s

,

where M (x) =Pn≤x µ(n) is the Mertens function. In particular, limkbβk =

Note that the limit also follows directly from Theorem 1.11 since for

G = Us, we have dim G(s) = 1.

10.4. Free nilpotent Lie algebras. In this paragraph g will denote the
free nilpotent Lie algebra Fd,s of step s on d generators.
gram λ, we denote by dλ(d) the dimension of the irreducible GLd-representation
Eλ(d) associated to λ.

Note that g has a natural structure of GLd-module. Given a Young dia-

When d ≥ s, g is clearly of class C (see Deﬁnition in §9.3). This is not

true however when s is much larger than d. So when d ≥ s we will show:
Theorem 10.4.1 (Critical exponent for free nilpotent groups). Let G be the
connected simply connected Lie group with Lie algebra g = Fd,s. Assume that
d ≥ s. Then, if k is large enough, the critical exponent for k-tuples in G is
given by

s (cid:1)
s (cid:1) −(cid:0)d+1
s (cid:1) ·(cid:0)k+1
Pi≤s M ( s

(cid:0)d+1
where M (x) =Pn≤x µ(n) is the Mertens function.

Passing to the limit, we get:

bβk =

Corollary 10.4.2 (Limiting value). For d ≥ s, we have the following limit
for the critical exponent for g = Fd,s:

1 + σk = max

λ (cid:26) dλ(k)

dλ(d)(cid:27) − 1,

(10.3)

where the maximum is taken over all Young diagrams λ that appear in the
(s) as a GLd-module. The following theorem of Klyachko
decomposition of g
describes this set of diagrams:
Theorem 10.4.4 (Klyachko [Klj74, Reu93]). Let g = Fd,s. Then, except for
(s) and (1, 1, . . . , 1), with the further exceptions of λ = (2, 2), when s = 4,
and λ = (2, 2, 2) when s = 6, all Young tableaux with s boxes and at most d
rows appear in the decomposition of g

[s] into irreducible GLd-modules.

Remark 10.4.3. This shows that the strict inequality
can happen.

dim g(s) < limkbβk < 1

We now pass to the proof of Theorem 10.4.1. Recall the deﬁnition of
the diophantine exponent σk from (9.9), which captures the contribution of
brackets of order s. According to Proposition 6.2.3 we have:

1 + σk = max{

dim W
dim Wg

; W ≤ F [s]

k,g rational GLk -module},

where Wg the image of W in g, namely the span of all r(X1, . . . , Xk), r ∈ W ,
X1, . . . , Xk ∈ g.
Recall Proposition 9.4.1, which describes precisely the GLk-submodules of
F [s]
k,g. An immediate consequence of this proposition is the following simpler
expression for σk:

48

M. AKA, E. BREUILLARD, L. ROSENZWEIG, N. DE SAXC´E

We thus need to maximize dλ(k)

dλ(d) over all diagrams with s boxes, at most
d rows, and diﬀerent from the above exceptions. For this we prove the
following lemma:

Lemma 10.4.5. Let µ and λ be two Young diagrams with at most d rows
and having the same number of boxes. If µ can be obtained from λ by moving
some boxes downwards, then for any k ≥ d,
dλ(k)
dλ(d)

dµ(k)
dµ(d) ≥

.

Proof. Without loss of generality we may assume that µ is obtained from λ
by moving only one box downwards, i.e. µi = λi, except for µr = λr − 1 and
µs = λs + 1 for some indices r < s. Using Weyl’s dimension formula:

we get

The Young diagram λ, which is present in g
value in (10.3) is the diagram with s boxes of the form λ0 := (2, 1, . . . , 1),
because we have assumed s ≤ d. Using Weyl’s dimension formula, it is easy
to compute

dλ0(k) = (s − 1)(cid:18)k + 1
s (cid:19).

k is such that r(g

Since d ≥ s, g is of class C (see Deﬁnition in §9.3), because if i < s and

weight vector r in W can involve at most i ≤ d letters, hence (substituting

It follows (see the proof of Theorem 9.3.1) that when d ≥ s, then bβk =

sσk/ηG(k) for large k. For the same reason, when k ≥ d ≥ s, the relatively
free Lie algebra Fk,g coincides with the free Lie algebra Fk,s of step s. In
particular, the growth exponent ηG(k) is given by (10.2). This concludes
the proof of Theorem 10.4.1.

11. Concluding remarks

In this last section we record a few further comments on our results and

future prospects.

11.1. Schubert closure. As hinted in the introduction, diophantine ap-
proximation on submanifolds of matrices is equivalent to a certain diophan-
tine scheme for submanifolds of the Grassmannian of n-planes in Rm+n. The
problem is thus phrased more intrinsically. Theorems 1.2 and 1.5 strongly
suggest that a stronger version of Theorem 1.4 holds, namely that the pen-
cils containing M entirely determine the exponent, also in the non-rational

DIOPHANTINE APPROXIMATION ON MATRICES AND LIE GROUPS

49

case. We were able to verify this in a number of cases, e.g. when the Zariski
closure is deﬁned over the algebraic numbers, or for small values of m and
n. The intersection of all pencils containing M, call it the Schubert closure
of M, is also the intersection of all Schubert varieties of the Grassmannian
containing M, and it is in general larger than the Pl¨ucker closure. In fact,
we believe that the exponent of M is inherited already from one single pencil
containing it.

11.2. Determination of the exponent. Theorem 1.4 reduces the compu-
tation of the exponent of an analytic submanifold of the Grassmannian to
the exponent of a Pl¨ucker closed submanifold. It would be of great interest
to determine explicitly the exponent of such a manifold in terms of diophan-
tine exponents of the equations deﬁning it. More concretely, one would like
to have a formula for the exponent of a pencil PW,r in terms of (determin-
istic) diophantine exponents measuring the quality of approximation of W
(or its subspaces) by rational subspaces.

11.3. Exponent for nilpotent groups and weighted approximation.
Our formula for the exponent of a nilpotent group in Theorem 9.5.1 is valid
only when the number k of letters is large and for nilpotent groups of class
C. It would be of interest to determine it for all rational nilpotent groups
(as we claimed without proof in [ABRdS15b]), as well as for the remain-
ing small values of k. This involves ﬁnding the analogue of Theorem 1.2
for the following weighted version of the matrix diophantine approximation
scheme: suppose r = (r1, . . . , rm+n) is a non-decreasing family of positive
numbers and deﬁne for x ∈ Mm,m+n(R) the weighted exponent βr(s) to be
the inﬁmum of all β > 0 such that

has only ﬁnitely many solutions p ∈ Zm+n with |pi| ≤ nri for each i =
1, . . . , m + n.

kx · pk < n−β,

11.4. Other diophantine approximation schemes. Several diﬀerent but
closely related diophantine approximation schemes are natural and of inter-
est. For example the intrinsic approximation in the Grassmannian in the
spirit of the works [KM15, FKMS14] for quadrics. One can also study ana-
logues of multiplicative approximation in the spirit of the original work of
Kleinbock-Margulis [KM98] and strong extremality conditions as in [BKM15,
Cor. 2.4] (see forthcoming work of the second and fourth author with T.
Das and D. Simmons).

11.5. Khintchine-Groshev and Jarnik theory. What happens of badly
approximable points at the critical exponent ? We expect them to have
measure zero in the spirit of [Bak76]. More generally, it would be of great
interest to determine a Khintchine-type theorem for diophantine approxi-
mation on manifolds. This question has been raised by several authors, see
e.g. [KM98, BKM01, BBKM02, BKM15]. The same can be said regarding
the diophantine approximation scheme for subgroups of Lie groups tackled
in our paper. Similarly, one ought to seek a formula for the Hausdorﬀ di-
mension of the set of k-tuples in Gk with diophantine exponent β, i.e. a
Jarnik-type theorem for nilpotent Lie groups.

11.6. Other Lie groups. Beside the semisimple Lie groups, for which is it
still unknown whether or not they are diophantine, one ought to consider
the case of solvable groups, such as the aﬃne group of the real line, or
even the group of Euclidean motions of the plane. It is not known whether
they are diophantine. The state of the art for these groups is Varj´u’s result
[Var14] about about a one parameter family of generators in the complex
aﬃne group.
