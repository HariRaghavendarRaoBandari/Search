We extend the Krylov subspace based time dependent
numerical simulation technique for a qubit interacting
with photons in a waveguide to the multiple qubit case.
We analyze photon scattering from two qubits analyt-
ically and derive expressions for the bound states in
the continuum (BIC). We show how the BIC can be
excited. We use the BIC in a recent Pauli Z gate pro-
posal involving decoherence free subspaces and obtain
the gate ﬁdelity as a function of the gate parameters.
The techniques presented in the paper are useful for
investigating the time evolution of quantum gates and
other many-body systems with multiple quenches in
the Hamiltonian.

Introduction
grated superconducting qubits [1] and atoms coupled to the
near ﬁelds of waveguides [2] have made it possible to build
systems composed of multiple qubits, paving the way to the
development of quantum information processing architectures.
Investigation of such waveguide integrated qubits in the sin-
gle photon regime was primarily made through the application
of the transfer matrix technique [3–6]. Multiple excitation case
was analyzed in [7] under the Markovian approximation, i.e.
assuming that the separation between the qubits is small. In
[8], an exact method was developed for scattering of two pho-
tons from two qubits with an arbitrary separation, treating the
waveguide dispersion as a linear function of the wave vector k.
Time evolution of a system of two qubits—both initially excited—
in a waveguide with a linearized dispersion relationship was
investigated in [9]. Multi photon, multi qubit systems are very
relevant for quantum information processing systems, however,
exact analytical analysis of their behavior is a quite difﬁcult task.
Therefore, it is of interest to be able to study their dynamics
using alternative means.

Numerical Approach Krylov subspace based time evolution of a
waveguide embedded qubit system under one- and two-photon
excitation was investigated in [10–12] where the waveguide
was modeled as a series cavities coupled to one another in a
tight-binding fashion, leading to a cosine shaped dispersion

relationship. The basis functions in [10] are given in terms of
the Kronecker products of single particle states. This approach
requires paying particular attention to the symmetry properties
of the underlying bosonic photon wave functions. Additionally,
the number of unknowns in the system becomes larger than
physically required, since the bosonic symmetry properties of
the photons are not taken into consideration. Furthermore, this
particular basis is not easily expanded to multi-qubit case in a
methodical fashion.

As mentioned in [13], four parts of an exact diagonalization
code are 1) generation of the basis states, 2) generation of the
Hamiltonian, 3) method of obtaining eigenvalues and eigenvec-
tors, 4) measurement of observables. In a time evolution code,
the third part is not necessary due to the existence of numerical
algorithms that can calculate the exponential of a sparse matrix
without explicitly calculating the eigenvectors of the matrix. We
take the approach described in [10–12] and modify it to use the
occupation basis states, which are by construction symmetric.
Furthermore, in a lattice of length L with m excitations, the size
of the occupation basis is given by (L+m−1
L−1 ) whereas the Kro-
necker product basis scales as Lm. The difference in the basis
size is signiﬁcant for m = 3 or more.

We also extend the Hamiltonian introduced in [10–12] to

include multiple qubits. The Hamiltonian is given by (¯h = 1)

s are the energy level spacing, the coupling con-
stant, the Pauli z operator and the raising and lowering operator,
respectively, for qubit s positioned at xs. There are n qubits.

Although the use of the occupation state basis reduces the
number of unknowns in the system, it also leads to some compli-
cations. First of all, one should be able to create all (L+m−1
L−1 ) states
in a systematic manner for arbitrary L and m values. We use
the algorithm provided in [14] for basis creation. Next, when
using the basis states, they should be ordered in a way that
makes it easy to access an arbitrary basis element. A hashing
function is needed to uniquely assign a signature to each basis
vector. We implement the approach described in [15]. We also

pay particular attention to the normalization of the occupation
state basis elements [16]. The Hamiltonian preserves the number
of excitations in the system. The excitations are shared among
the qubits and photons. By creating all possible combinations
that lead to a ﬁxed given excitation, we create different sectors
with different states for the qubits. For instance, in the case of
three excitations and two qubits, the four sectors in the system
are 1) three photons with both qubits in their ground states, 2)
two photons with the left or 3) the right qubit excited, and 4)
one photon with both qubits excited. Once the basis sets for
each sector is known, one can generate the representation of
H in terms of a sparse matrix. There are a number of ways
to calculate the exponential of a matrix [17], required in time
evolution codes where the time evolution operator exp(−iHt)
acts on a given state |ψ(cid:105). We used the Expokit implementation
[18] which comes with ready to use Matlab code. In Fig. 1(a)
we show the results of scattering of a multi-photon Gaussian
pulse from a single qubit, replicating a study made in [11] for
a lattice size of L = 99, Ω =
2, ¯g = J = 1, pulse center wave
vector k0 = 3π
4 , spatial pulse width of 5. Our results and those in
[11] agree very well with each other. Whereas [11] used density
matrix renormalization group technique for 3 and 4 photons,
with the new basis set, we can simulate those cases in our Krylov
subspace based code [19] which we wrote using elements from
the literate programming approach [20].

Single Photon Scattering From Two Qubits Now that we veriﬁed
our numerical approach for a single qubit, let us look into the
case of two qubits. We will use a resolvent based method de-
tailed in [21] to analyze the scattering of a photon from two
qubits. The resolvent is deﬁned as G(z) = (z − H)−1. The
Hamiltonian is written in the wave vector k basis as H = H0 + V

The T-matrix elements are related to the matrix elements
of the resolvent through the relationship G(z) = G0(z) +
G0(z)T(z)G0(z) where G0 = (z − H0)−1. Thus, we are tasked
with ﬁnding the matrix elements of G(z). We use the Lippmann–
Schwinger equation for the resolvent, G = G0 + G0VG =
G0 + GVG0, in conjunction with the identity operator for two
qubits in the single excitation sector

show the reﬂection probability of a single photon Gaussian pulse
of spatial width 20, from two qubits with Ω1 = 0.4, Ω2 = 0.8,
¯g1 = 0.4, ¯g2 = 0.2 separated by 5 spatial units. We obtain the
reﬂection coefﬁcient numerically from Krylov subspace based
code as well as analytically via the integration of the Gaussian
pulse with rk. The two results agree very well with each other,
providing further evidence that the code works as expected. The
Gaussian pulse width in k space leads to a smoothing of the |rk|2
envelope.

of time. We then evaluated the time evolution of an initially
doubly excited, |↑↑(cid:105), two qubit system where the separation
R and Ω1 = Ω2 = ωk(cid:63) which
of the qubits is R = 5, k(cid:63) = π
are parameters suitable for the formation of an even BIC. The
results of the simulation are shown in Fig. 2. We observe that the
probability of observing |↑↑(cid:105) decays down to zero whereas the
probability of having the ﬁrst qubit excited shows an oscillatory
pattern with a corresponding bouncing photon state in between
the two qubits. These results show the formation of a super-
position of multiple bound states which leads to the oscillatory
pattern, similar to the oscillations observed in the case of an
initially excited single qubit [21]. Excitation of the BIC for the
case of a waveguide with a linear dispersion relationship was
also predicted in [9].

Bound states of the two
Bound States in the Continuum (BIC)
qubit system are investigated in [22–25]. We will be interested
in the bound states with energies that fall into the continuum
(−2J, 2J) band for propagating photons. To do so, we ﬁnd the
location of the poles of the resolvent matrix elements by investi-
gating the zeros of the denominator function as deﬁned in Eq. (2)
for two identical qubits with Ω1 = Ω2 = Ω and ¯g1 = ¯g2 = ¯g.
The zero locations are at Ω = z(cid:48) = ωk(cid:63) with 1 ± eik(cid:63)R = 0 which
correspond to the even (+) and odd (−) solutions, respectively.
For even solutions we have k(cid:63) = (2ne − 1) π
R whereas in the odd
case k(cid:63) = 2no π
R with ne, no integers. We calculate the residues
of the matrix elements of G(z) at the pole locations to calculate
the coefﬁcients of the elements of the bound state in continuum.

the |↓↑(cid:105) and |x↓↓(cid:105) parts of the BIC are obtained by consider-
ing Res((cid:104)↑↓|G(z(cid:48))|↓↑(cid:105), ωk(cid:63) ) and Res((cid:104)k↓↓|G(z(cid:48))|↑↓(cid:105), ωk(cid:63) ). The
photonic part (cid:104)x↓↓|Ψ(cid:105) is zero for |x| > R/2 due to the fact that
1 ± eik(cid:63)R = 0. Eq. (4) agrees with [25] and extends the results
obtained for a waveguide with a linear dispersion as reported in
[23] to the dispersive case.

We used our code to evaluate the time evolution of the BIC
and veriﬁed that they are indeed eigenstates of H by observing
that the state of the system remains unchanged as a function

Pauli (-Z) Gate in a Four Qubit System We now investigate a quan-
tum gate proposal made in [26] for four qubits in a waveguide
making use of the decoherence free subspace composed of qubit
states that are antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any
two qubits. As argued in [25], the decoherence free subspace can
be obtained in a one-dimensional waveguide setting through the
use of the BIC. We follow the construction in [26] and form logi-
cal qubits consisting of two neighboring physical qubits, as illus-
trated in the inset of Fig. 3(a). The logical qubit states are deﬁned
as |0(cid:105) ≡ |↓↓(cid:105) and |1(cid:105) ≡ |Ψ−
no(cid:105). At t = 0 we initialize the system
at the superposition state (|10(cid:105) + |01(cid:105))/
2. If we only consider
the qubit parts of the total wave function the initial state is given
by N√
(|↑↓↓↓(cid:105) − |↓↑↓↓(cid:105) + |↓↓↑↓(cid:105) − |↓↓↓↑(cid:105)). We aim to incur a
phase difference between the |01(cid:105) and |10(cid:105) states so as to test
the Pauli Z gate proposal. To do so, we apply a control Hamilto-
∆
nian HC(t) where ∆H12 =
2 (σz1 + σz2 ) is turned on for a ﬁnite
duration [26] as sketched in Fig. 3(a) which effectively changes
the level spacing of the ﬁrst two qubits from Ω to Ω + ∆ while
HC is on. We can approximate the time evolution of the qubit
states by considering the effects of H0 and HC(t) but neglecting
V. Note that (H0 + ∆H12)|↑↓↓↓(cid:105) = −Ω|↑↓↓↓(cid:105) and similarly
for |↓↑↓↓(cid:105). However, (H0 + ∆H12)|↓↓↑↓(cid:105) = −(Ω + ∆)|↓↓↑↓(cid:105).
We see that ∆H12 results in an extra ∆ term when the left log-
ical qubit is in |0(cid:105) state, but no such term exists when the left
logical qubit is at |1(cid:105) state. When we apply HC(t) for a du-
ration T and consider evolution of the initial state approxi-
mately via exp[iH0T] exp[−i(H0 + HC)T], we arrive at the ﬁnal
state N√
action picture with respect to H0. For ∆T = π the ﬁnal state
becomes (|10(cid:105) − |01(cid:105))/
2 and we have effectively a Pauli (-Z)
gate for the left logical qubit.

In the presence of the full Hamiltonian where qubit-photon

We record the state of the system as a function of time in the

with
|1(cid:105) ≡ 1√
(|↑↓(cid:105) − |↓↑(cid:105)) denoting an ideal logic state. We also

calculate the ﬁdelity of the gate deﬁned as F ≡ |(cid:104)ψI|ψ(t)(cid:105)| where
the ideal ﬁnal state is |ψI(cid:105) = 1√
(|10(cid:105) − |01(cid:105)). In Fig. 3(b) we plot
F as a function of time when HC(t) is turned on between t = 10
and t = 70 for different R, ¯g and no values. When the separation
R is small and ¯g is low, we get F close to 1. Increases in these
parameters lower the ﬁdelity. We can understand the reasons
behind the changes in F by considering the motion of a10 and
a01 on the complex plane as time progresses. In Fig. 3(c) at t = 0,

can be extended to simulate gates with multiple quenches, as
in [28], to approximate arbitrarily shaped pulses. Recently, cou-
pling between qubits and periodic waveguides was studied in
[29] and it would be of interest to extend the methods presented
in this paper to such geometries. The code provided with the
paper [19] can be of use in simulating quantum many-body pro-
posals utilizing bound states [30] or for studying topological
order in one-dimensional waveguiding systems [31].

a circular fashion towards the negative real axis. a10 remains
pinned near the positive real axis for low ¯g as highlighted by
the dashed circle in Fig. 3(c). However, increases in ¯g, R or no
lead to an increased motion for a10, lowering F. Furthermore,
as is evident from Eq. (4), such changes lead to a decrease in N
which reduces F as well. Oscillations in F are due to bouncing
trapped photon states in between the qubits.

Conclusion We extended the Krylov subspace based numerical
time evolution method in [10–12] to multi-photon, multi-qubit
case. We veriﬁed the numerical method and the code developed
with previously published results and analytical studies. We de-
rived the bound states in the continuum for a two qubit system
and have shown how they can be excited from a doubly excited
two qubit system. We made use of the bound states in designing
a Pauli (-Z) gate following the proposal in [26]. We used our
numerical time evolution code to study the properties of the
gate as a function system parameters. Our numerical method is
currently lacking any absorbing boundary conditions and the
development of such boundaries compatible with many-body
systems would greatly help in simulations. Our quantum gate
is assumed to abruptly change the Hamiltonian of the system,
however, better pulse shapes are conceivable [27]. Our approach
