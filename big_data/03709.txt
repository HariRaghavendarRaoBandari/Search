Abstract

Zodiacal emission is thermal emission from interplanetary dust.

Its contribution to the sky

brightness is non-negligible in the region near the ecliptic plane, even in the far-infrared (far-

IR) wavelength regime. We analyse zodiacal emission observed by the AKARI far-IR all-sky

survey, which covers 97% of the entire sky at arcminute-scale resolution in four photometric

bands, with central wavelengths of 65, 90, 140, and 160 µm. AKARI detected small-scale

structures in the zodiacal dust cloud, including the asteroidal dust bands and the circumsolar

ring, at far-IR wavelengths. Although the smooth component of the zodiacal emission structure

in the far-IR sky can be reproduced well by models based on existing far-IR observations,

previous zodiacal emission models have discrepancies in the small-scale structures compared

with observations. We investigate the geometry of the small-scale dust-band structures in the

1

AKARI far-IR all-sky maps and construct template maps of the asteroidal dust bands and the
circumsolar ring components based on the AKARI far-IR maps. In the maps, ±1.◦4, ±2.◦1 and
±10◦ asteroidal dust-band structures are detected in the 65 µm and 90 µm bands. A possible
±17◦ band may also have been detected. No evident dust-band structures are identiﬁed in
either the 140 µm or the 160 µm bands. By subtracting the dust-band templates constructed

in this paper, we can achieve a similar level of ﬂux calibration of the AKARI far-IR all-sky maps
in the |β| < 40◦ region to that in the region for |β| > 40◦.
Key words: interplanetary medium — zodiacal dust — asteroids: general — infrared: ISM — surveys

1 Introduction

Zodiacal emission (ZE) is thermal emission from interplanetary dust (IPD). It dominates the diffuse
radiation in the mid- to far-infrared (IR) wavelength regime. Since the dust located at around 1 astro-
nomical unit (a.u.) from the Sun has a thermal equilibrium temperature of ∼ 280 K, the ZE exhibits
a spectral peak around 10–20 µm, which dominates the mid-IR brightness of the diffuse emission in
the sky. Even in the far-IR regime, the ZE contribution is non-negligible at high Galactic latitudes,
where Galactic radiation is relatively weak. IPD originates mainly from comets and asteroids, and it
is distributed across the solar system. The zodiacal dust cloud is characterized by a relatively smooth
distribution, resulting in the dominant diffuse emission. However, observations with the Infrared
Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) revealed that small-scale structures (on scales of a few to a few tens
of degrees) are present in the ZE distribution, such as those tracing the asteroidal dust bands and a
circumsolar resonance ring (Low et al. 1984; Dermott et al. 1984).

The zodiacal dust bands were ﬁrst discovered with IRAS in its 12 µm to 100 µm data (Low
et al. 1984; Neugebauer et al. 1984). They have subsequently been conﬁrmed by the Diffuse Infrared
Background Experiment (DIRBE) onboard the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), as well as by
ground-based observations (Spiesman et al. 1995; Reach et al. 1997; Ishiguro et al. 1999a; Ishiguro et
al. 1999b). They provide a link between the asteroidal source of the IPD and the present distribution
of the zodiacal cloud. There are three major band pairs among the dust bands that form small-scale
latitudinal features in the ZE. They are thought to be produced by thermal emission from three pairs of
circumsolar dust rings near inclinations with respect to the invariant plane of the planets, ip = ±1.◦4,
±2.◦1, and ±9.◦3 (Sykes 1988; Sykes 1990; Grogan et al. 2001). The two central bands (at ±1.◦4 and
±2.◦1) are blended in low-resolution data (see e.g., Reach et al. 1997), and high-resolution maps are

2

required to identify and distinguish the band pairs. It has been proposed that recent disruption events
among multi-kilometer bodies in the main asteroid belt, which would have occurred within the last
several million years, may be major supply sources of dust particles, and they would produce edge-
brightened toroidal dust distributions (referred to as the “catastrophic” or “non-equilibrium” model;
Sykes & Greenberg 1986; Sykes 1988). Recent detailed studies (Nesvorn´y et al. 2002; Nesvorn´y et al.
2003; Nesvorn´y et al. 2006; Nesvorn´y et al. 2008) have provided evidence supporting the disruption
model as the possible origin of the asteroidal dust bands. Nesvorn´y et al. (2003) proposed that the dust
band characterized by an inclination of ±9.◦3 may have originated from the Veritas asteroid family,
at a distance of 3.17 a.u. from the Sun, which formed through collisional disruption 8.3 ± 0.5 Myr
ago, while the ±2.◦1 band may have originated from the Karin family, which formed 5.75± 0.05 Myr
ago and is located inside the Koronis asteroid family at a solar distance of 2.87 a.u. (Nesvorn´y et al.
2002; Nesvorn´y et al. 2003; Nesvorn´y & Vokrouhlick´y 2006). Nesvorn´y et al. (2008) also proposed
a recent breakup of the new candidate Beagle asteroid family as the source of the ±1.◦4 band.

Dust from the asteroids and comets, which continues to spiral in towards the inner Solar
System, is subject to gravitational perturbations by the planets. The presence of a circumsolar ring
(i.e., a ring structure of dust originating from the outer Solar System that is resonantly trapped by
the Earth in orbits near 1 a.u. from the Sun) has been proposed theoretically (e.g., Jackson & Zook
1989). The sky brightness near the ecliptic plane, as observed with IRAS, is brighter in the Earth-
trailing than in the leading direction (Dermott et al. 1994). Dermott et al. (1994) showed, based on
numerical simulations, that this brightness asymmetry is caused by a trailing blob of dust particles
trapped in mean-motion resonances (MMRs) with the Earth. This Earth’s resonance structure has
been conﬁrmed using COBE/DIRBE observations (Reach et al. 1995). The existence of a similar cir-
cumsolar ring at the orbit of Venus has also been conﬁrmed based on the imaging data of the STEREO
mission (Jones et al. 2013). In addition to these small-scale structures on scales of a few to a few tens
of degrees, ﬁner-scale features associated with the orbits of periodic comets, the so-called cometary
dust trails, have also been observed in the IRAS survey data (Sykes et al. 1986; Sykes & Walker
1992; Reach et al. 2000).

To determine the brightness distribution of the ZE and the spatial structure of the IPD, full-
sky surveys obtained with IR satellites are particularly powerful (e.g., Hauser et al. 1984; Reach
1992; Reach et al. 1997; Fixsen & Dwek 2002; Pyo et al. 2010; Planck Collaboration et al. 2014).
Subsequent to IRAS, COBE/DIRBE conducted an all-sky survey with a wider wavelength coverage
than IRAS (Hauser et al. 1998). Many efforts have been devoted to describing the structure of the
zodiacal dust cloud, and a number of models have been developed using IR satellite data, including the
IRAS and COBE/DIRBE surveys (Good et al. 1986; Rowan-Robinson et al. 1990; Rowan-Robinson

3

et al. 1991; Jones & Rowan-Robinson 1993; Vrtilek & Hauser 1995; Kelsall et al. 1998; Wright
1998; Rowan-Robinson & May 2013). The most commonly used ZE models are based on the DIRBE
data (e.g., Kelsall et al. 1998: hereafter the Kelsall model; Wright 1998: hereafter the Wright model).
Gorjian et al. (2000) investigated the DIRBE ZE model in depth and modiﬁed the parameters of the
Wright model (Wright 1998). The Kelsall and the Wright/Gorjian models explain the IPD cloud
complex with the following three components: a smooth cloud, asteroidal dust bands and an MMR
component. In the Kelsall model, the MMR component is further divided into a circumsolar ring
and a blob trailing the Earth (Kelsall et al. 1998). For each of the three components, parameterised
functions have been introduced to describe the spatial distribution of the dust number density in
heliocentric coordinates.

These models, however, have limitations in their ability to reproduce small-scale structures.
The COBE/DIRBE team provided Zodi-Subtracted Mission Average (ZSMA) map data, which were
created by subtracting the ZE using the Kelsall model week-by-week and averaging the residual in-
tensity values. Small-scale residual ZE structures near the ecliptic plane can be seen clearly in the
ZSMA maps, in particular at mid-IR wavelengths (e.g., Kelsall et al. 1998). It is therefore necessary
to construct a ZE model based on IR-satellite data with higher spatial resolution.

Following the completion of the IRAS and COBE/DIRBE missions, a few satellites have
since conducted full-sky surveys in the IR regimes, including AKARI and the Wide-ﬁeld Infrared
Survey Explorer (WISE; Wright et al. 2010). Table 1 offers a comparison of major full-sky mid-
and far-IR satellite surveys. The Japanese satellite AKARI, a satellite dedicated to IR astronomical
observations, was the third mission to survey the whole sky at mid- and far-IR wavelengths (Murakami
et al. 2007). Although most of the smooth ZE structure seen in the AKARI mid- and far-IR images can
be reproduced well with the Kelsall or the Wright/Gorjian models, there are discrepancies on small
scales (Pyo et al. 2010; Kondo et al. 2016). In particular, the intensities and the ecliptic latitudes of the
peak positions of the asteroidal dust bands and the MMRs cannot be precisely reproduced with these
models (Pyo et al. 2010; Doi et al. 2015; Kondo et al. 2016). The DIRBE model cannot reproduce
the real ﬁne structure of the asteroidal dust-band components, because DIRBE operated with a large
42′ × 42′ beam, and only a small fraction of the DIRBE data were used to construct the DIRBE ZE
model (Kelsall et al. 1998; Wright 1998). Pyo et al. (2010) also reported an inconsistency of 20% in
the intensity of the ring component between the AKARI observations and the Kelsall model prediction
in the mid-IR regime.

Since the ZE is the nearest source of diffuse emission to the Earth and an important foreground
component for studies of Galactic and extragalactic emission at IR wavelengths, it is extremely im-
portant to understand the nature of the zodiacal dust cloud, not only for Solar System science. It is

4

crucial to precisely evaluate the contribution of the ZE to the IR sky brightness. The diffuse emission
in the far-IR regime is, for instance, a direct measure of the column density of the interstellar dust,
and a full-sky far-IR map can also be used as a measure of the extinction for the emission from extra-
galactic objects. A careful treatment of the ZE is also required for the construction of extinction maps
(Schlegel et al. 1998; Finkbeiner et al. 1999; Meisner & Finkbeiner 2014; Planck Collaboration et al.
2014).

We performed an all-sky survey with the AKARI satellite (Murakami et al. 2007). The all-
sky far-IR map data have been publicly released (Doi et al. 2015). AKARI covers wavelengths longer
than 100 µm and has a higher spatial resolution (1′–1.5′) than IRAS. It is important to obtain a precise
estimate of the ZE contribution to the far-IR sky and provide a ZE template and ZE-subtracted far-IR
maps based on the AKARI data. This paper is part of a series in which we present AKARI far-IR
diffuse emission map data. Doi et al. (2015) provide detailed descriptions of both the AKARI far-
IR all-sky survey and the data-processing scheme applied to the all-sky maps. Takita et al. (2015)
report on the calibration process and quality of the AKARI far-IR all-sky maps. In this paper, we
evaluate the residual ZE contribution, in particular of the zodiacal dust bands, in the publicly released
AKARI far-IR maps and discuss the AKARI ZE-distribution template maps. We extract the structure
of the zodiacal dust bands from the AKARI far-IR maps and brieﬂy discuss their observed properties.
The main goal of this study is to provide ZE template maps and ZE-subtracted far-IR maps based on
the AKARI far-IR all-sky survey data1. Detailed analysis of the dynamics of the dust bands, much
smaller-scale structures (such as cometary dust trails) and the construction of a three-dimensional
ZE model (such as the Kelsall model) are beyond the scope of this study but will be explored in
forthcoming papers.

2 Observations and Data Sets

2.1 AKARI observations and far-IR all-sky maps

AKARI was designed as an all-sky survey mission in the mid- and far-IR wavelength regime
(Murakami et al. 2007). The satellite was equipped with a cryogenically cooled telescope of 68.5 cm
aperture diameter and two scientiﬁc instruments, the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS; Kawada et al. 2007)
and the Infrared Camera (IRC; Onaka et al. 2007). AKARI was launched in 2006 February and the
all-sky survey was performed during the period 2006 April to 2007 August, which was the cold op-
eration phase of the satellite, when it was cooled with liquid helium cryogen. Its 16-month cryogenic
mission lifetime is thus by far the longest among the far-IR survey missions. The all-sky survey

observations at far-IR wavelengths were performed by employing the FIS instrument (Kawada et al.
2007). Four photometric bands were used: the N60 band (50–80 µm, centred at 65 µm), the WIDE-S
band (50–110 µm, centred at 90 µm), the WIDE-L band (110–180 µm, centred at 140 µm) and the
N160 band (140–180 µm, centred at 160 µm). The AKARI far-IR all-sky survey maps2, which have
a better spatial resolution than the IRAS maps, were recently released publicly (Doi et al. 2015).

The observed far-IR sky brightness consists of the ZE, the integrated light from the Galactic
components (stars and emission from the interstellar medium) and extragalactic emission. Since
AKARI far-IR all-sky map data are processed mainly to study the Galactic and extragalactic objects,
the ZE components in the released maps have been subtracted during data processing. As mentioned
previously, although we tried to subtract the ZE from the AKARI far-IR data by applying the DIRBE
ZE models (Kelsall et al. 1998; Wright 1998; Gorjian et al. 2000), we found that there are discrep-
ancies on small scales between the model estimates and the observed data, especially in relation to
the asteroidal dust bands and the MMRs. Under these circumstances, we only subtracted the smooth
component of the ZE, based on the Gorjian model (Gorjian et al. 2000), from the publicly released
AKARI far-IR maps (for more details, see Doi et al. 2015). We have not yet subtracted the asteroidal
dust-band and the MMR components from the data. Consequently, contributions from these compo-
nents remain present in the images, and this is recognisable in the shorter-wavelength bands (N60 and
WIDE-S). Next, we investigate the residual ZE contribution to the AKARI far-IR all-sky maps and
construct a ZE template map, including the asteroidal dust bands and the MMRs.

2.2 Leading/trailing maps and data reduction

The AKARI orbit and observation strategy are described in detail by Murakami et al. (2007) and
Doi et al. (2015). AKARI orbited the Earth in a Sun-synchronous polar orbit with a period of about
100 min. During each orbit, the satellite scanned the sky in the Earth-leading and trailing directions.
The AKARI orbit processed ∼ 1◦ per day, and the AKARI scans were obtained at an approximately
constant solar elongation of 90± 1◦. A given longitude, observed in the Earth-leading direction, was
re-observed in the Earth-trailing direction from a different position 6 months later. Using both the
leading and trailing scans, AKARI achieved almost complete sky coverage in 6 months, although
some regions are affected by the South Atlantic Anomaly (an anomalously higher-density region of
solar protons) and the Moon (Doi et al. 2015). AKARI observed 97% of the sky twice or more during
the 16 months of its cryogenic mission lifetime, and the full data set from all 16 months was used for
the construction of the publicly released AKARI maps (Doi et al. 2015). Therefore, most sky regions
in the AKARI image were processed with data from different satellite (Earth) positions and lines of
sight (both in the leading and trailing directions).

The IPD cloud is asymmetric with respect to the Earth, and the observed ZE brightness
changes with satellite position. AKARI observed the Galactic and extragalactic components along
almost the same lines of sight, whereas dust in the Solar System was observed along completely dif-
ferent lines of sight from opposite positions, 6 months apart along the Earth’s orbit. To investigate
the ZE component, we therefore divided and reprocessed each of the released AKARI far-IR maps
for all four bands into two separate maps, according to whether they were observed in the leading or
trailing directions. The original AKARI maps have a pixel scale of 15′′ and a spatial resolution (i.e.,
the full width at half maximum of the point-spread function) of 1–1.5′ (Takita et al. 2015). The aster-
oidal dust bands and the MMR components exhibit much more extensive spatial structures, covering
a few and a few tens of degrees along the latitudinal direction, respectively. To reduce the noise and
contributions from both much smaller-scale structures and point sources, we reconstructed the maps
with a resolution of 0.◦2. We use these maps, in the Earth-leading and trailing directions, to extract
the structure of the ZE distribution in the following analysis. The processed sky-brightness maps in
the four FIS bands are shown in ﬁgure 1 for both the leading and trailing directions. Other IR-satellite
survey missions (e.g., IRAS, COBE/DIRBE or WISE) lack certain regions in longitude (∼ 15%) in
their leading/trailing maps, because their cryogenic mission lifetimes were shorter than 1 year. The
AKARI survey data cover all ecliptic longitudes (λ = 0◦–360◦), except for the small regions affected
by the Moon, both in the leading and trailing maps within the satellite’s 16-month cryogenic mis-
sion period. By using the AKARI leading/trailing maps, we can investigate the continuous dust-band

7

structures along all ecliptic longitudes.

Asteroidal dust bands appear as pairs of equally spaced parallel bands that are oriented along
the ecliptic longitude direction in a sinusoidal fashion above and below the ecliptic plane. The con-
tinuous, smooth distribution of the dust bands and the MMR component along the ecliptic plane can
be seen in the N60 and WIDE-S maps (see ﬁgure 1). In the “snap-shot image” of the DIRBE weekly
sky map covering the wide solar elongation angle of 60◦–120◦, the MMR component in the Earth’s
orbit shows an elliptical structure. The full-width at half-maximum brightness of the trailing blob is
30◦ in latitude and 15◦ in longitude (Reach et al. 1995). AKARI always scans the central part of the
MMR component at the solar elongation of ∼ 90◦. As a consequence, the superposition of the MMR
component in the AKARI all-sky map appear as a horizontal faint band structure of ∼ 30◦ width in
latitude oriented along the ecliptic longitude direction. Note that the ZE smooth cloud component has
been subtracted from the AKARI images. To reduce the effects of non-Solar System contributions
to the sky brightness and to extract the dust-band distribution, we constructed difference maps using
the WIDE-S and WIDE-L bands. The two wide bands (WIDE-S and WIDE-L) yield higher-quality
images because they had a broader wavelength coverage than the two narrow bands (N60 and N160).

2.3 Difference maps based on the WIDE-S and WIDE-L data

Since Galactic emission is strong in the far-IR regime, extraction of the faint dust bands from the
far-IR maps is not a simple task. To measure the dust-band structure precisely, image-enhancing
techniques were used. Fourier ﬁltering is a commonly used technique to extract structures from an
image (e.g., Sykes 1988; Reach et al. 1997). However, it is likely that smooth and broad components
of the dust-band structures are removed by Fourier ﬁltering. Since the main aim of this paper is
to construct ZE templates that can be subtracted from the AKARI far-IR images, we adopted the
following approach to deduce the intensities and positions of the small-scale ZE structures.

The WIDE-S (90 µm) maps include both IPD and interstellar dust emission, while the WIDE-
L (140 µm) maps, which cover longer wavelengths than their WIDE-S counterparts, mainly detect
interstellar dust emission (IR Galactic cirrus). The dust grains in the asteroidal dust bands spiral
inward from the main asteroid belt (located at a distance from the Sun of ∼ 2–3 a.u.) to near the
Earth’s orbit and have a temperature of around 150–300 K. MMR dust, at ∼ 1 au, has a temperature
of around 280 K. Such dust exhibits a spectral peak at λ < 50 µm (Spiesman et al. 1995; Reach
et al. 1997). The ZE contribution to the WIDE-L (140 µm) map is much smaller than that to the
WIDE-S (90 µm) map. To reduce the contribution from Galactic dust and extract the small-scale
ZE structures, we subtracted 0.30 times the WIDE-L intensity (0.30 × IWIDE−L) from the WIDE-S

intensity (IWIDE−S) for both the leading and trailing maps. We derived the factor of 0.30 as follows:

RWIDE−S Bν(18.5 K) (ν/ν0)2 RWIDE−S(ν) dν/RWIDE−S RWIDE−S(ν) dν
RWIDE−L Bν(18.5 K) (ν/ν0)2 RWIDE−L(ν) dν/RWIDE−L RWIDE−L(ν) dν ∼ 0.30,

(1)

where Bν(18.5 K) is the Planck function at a temperature T = 18.5 K, RWIDE−S(ν) and RWIDE−L(ν)
are the relative spectral responses of the WIDE-S and WIDE-L bands, respectively (Doi et al.
2015), and ν0 = 3000 GHz is the reference frequency corresponding to λ ≃ 100 µm. Based on
previous studies (e.g., Schlegel et al. 1998; Planck Collaboration et al. 2014), we assumed that
the temperature of the interstellar dust is T ∼ 18.5 K and the emissivity of the interstellar dust
has a frequency (wavelength) dependence (ν/ν0)2 at wavelengths longwards of 100 µm. In these
(IWIDE−S − 0.30× IWIDE−L) maps (see ﬁgure 2; hereafter the “difference maps”), we can see promi-
nent sinusoidal dust bands near the ecliptic plane and at β∼±10◦. These images are used to determine
the locations and brightnesses of the dust bands.

3 Results: Zodiacal dust-band structure in the AKARI far-IR maps

3.1 Geometry of asteroidal dust bands and MMRs

To measure the latitudes of the dust bands and the structure of the circumsolar ring, we ﬁtted the
latitudinal proﬁles at |β| < 25◦ with Gaussian functions. Bands at ±1.◦4 and ±2.◦1 were identiﬁed
separately in the ﬁner-scale analysis of the 0.◦05 resolution map using the 25 µm IRAS Infrared Sky
Survey Atlas data, which were observed at a wavelength near the peak wavelength of the ZE spectrum
(Reach et al. 1997). However, in the 0.◦2 resolution AKARI maps at much longer wavelengths, these
two bands are apparently almost blended and look to be a single band. Hereafter, we refer to this pair
as the ±1.◦4/2.◦1 band. Five-Gaussian ﬁts (two Gaussians each for the ±1.◦4/2.◦1 and ±10◦ dust-band
pairs and one for the circumsolar ring) were performed to latitudinal proﬁles every 1◦ in longitude, for
the leading and trailing maps in ﬁgure 2. Although we reduced the Galactic cirrus contribution using
the difference maps, a Galactic-emission component remains present in the maps, as seen in ﬁgure
2. No |β| < 25◦ scans passing within 15◦ of the Galactic plane were used for ﬁtting. We adopted
Gaussian proﬁles because they are convenient ﬁtting functions and they were able to reproduce the
proﬁles adequately (see Reach 1992; Reach et al. 1997). Examples of ﬁve-Gaussian ﬁts are shown in
ﬁgure 3.

Table 2 summarizes the mean peak surface brightness, mean geocentric ecliptic latitude and
band widths obtained from the Gaussian ﬁts. Figure 4 shows the best-ﬁtting results for the peak
positions in the Earth-leading and trailing directions. There is an apparent annual variation of the
band latitudes with geocentric ecliptic longitude. Sinusoidal variations can be seen in the northern

directions. The maps are rendered in Cartesian projection in the ecliptic coordinate system, as in ﬁgure 1. There can be seen residual Galactic emission near

the Galactic plane (black region), which is attributed to the emission from the Galactic dust that has the temperature different from T = 18.5 K.

and southern components of each band pair. The annual variation is caused by the Earth’s changing
altitude with respect to the midplane of the band pairs.

The sinusoidal variation of the latitude of the dust bands can be expressed using the following

ǫ ∼ 90◦, the average latitude of the northern and southern bands (the midplane of the band pairs) is

notation refer to the Earth-leading/trailing direction: see Equation [3] of Reach (1992). Generally, the
heliocentric distance of the dust band (R) is determined as a parallactic distance from the band-pair
latitudes and the solar elongation angle (Reach 1992; Reach et al. 1997; Spiesman et al. 1995). Since
most AKARI scans were limited to a constant solar elongation, ǫ ∼ 90◦, it is difﬁcult to determine the
parallactic distance based on the AKARI data. Instead, the phase difference, ∆φ, between the annual
variation of the average latitude of the band pair for scans leading and trailing the Earth can be used
to measure the heliocentric distance of the bands, R (Reach 1991):

∆φ = 2 tan−1 √R2 − 1.

Once we obtain the heliocentric distance of the band pair (R), we can derive the inclination, i, and
the ascending node, Ω. The heliocentric distances of the band pairs, the inclination angles of the dust
bands and the locations of the ascending nodes derived from the AKARI maps are listed in Table 3.
The heliocentric distances of the band pairs are 1.86 and 2.16 a.u., the inclination angles of the dust
bands are 1.◦0 ± 0.◦1 and 1.◦3 ± 0.◦1, the ascending nodes are located at 112 ± 6◦ and 95 ± 5◦ for the
±1.◦4/2.◦1 and the ±10◦ bands, respectively.

It is also evident that the surface brightness of the dust bands varies as a function of ecliptic
longitude. Reach et al. (1997) refer to the phenomenon that the northern component is bright when
the southern component is faint, and vice versa, as “glints”. In the DIRBE maps, the northern and

Regions around 45◦ < |λ| < 135◦ were not used for ﬁtting because of the strong emission near the Galactic plane (|b| < 15◦).

southern glints occur roughly 180◦ apart, while the leading and trailing maps are roughly 180◦ out
of phase (Reach et al. 1997). Although the difference between the leading and trailing direction is
faint, similar dust-band glints are detected in the AKARI maps, and can be seen in the component
maps (ﬁgure 5) in particular for the ±10◦ band. We also performed sinusoidal ﬁts to the longitudinal
brightness variations of the northern and southern components.

Based on the brightnesses, latitudes and band widths derived from the sinusoidal ﬁtting pro-
cedure outlined above (see Tables 2 and 3, ﬁgure 4), we constructed a model map for the dust-band
structure in the far-IR regime. Our model maps for each component in the Earth-leading and trailing
directions are shown in ﬁgure 5.

3.2 AKARI ZE template maps

Since these component model maps were derived from the (IWIDE−S − 0.30 × IWIDE−L) difference
map, the surface brightness of the model map is fainter than the real brightness of the dust bands in
the WIDE-S map. To construct dust-band template maps for the four FIS bands, we considered the
temperatures of the dust-band components. As derived in section 3.1, the ±1.◦4/2.◦1 and ±10◦ dust
bands have radii of 1.86 a.u. and 2.16 a.u., respectively. It can thus be expected that the ±1.◦4/2.◦1
and ±10◦ components have typical temperatures of ∼ 200 K and ∼ 185 K, respectively. We assume a
temperature for the circumsolar ring component of 278 K, because the circumsolar ring is expected to
be composed of dust in the Earth’s orbit (1 a.u.). If we assume that the dust temperatures of the dust
bands are Td ∼ 185 K, 200 K, and 278 K, their brightnesses relative to those of the WIDE-S band data
are 1.376, 1.390 and 1.439 for the N60 band, 0.212, 0.208 and 0.193 for the WIDE-L band, and 0.133,
0.130 and 0.119 for the N160 band, respectively. To construct the corresponding dust-band maps in
the four FIS bands for the circumsolar-ring component (T = 278 K), we multiplied the brightness of
the component model by the following factors:
• N60: 1.439/(1.0 − 0.30 × 0.193) = 1.53;
• WIDE-S: 1.0/(1.0 − 0.30 × 0.193) = 1.06;
• WIDE-L: 0.193/(1.0 − 0.30 × 0.193) = 0.20;
• N160: 0.119/(1.0 − 0.30 × 0.193) = 0.13.
The ±1.◦4/2.◦1 and ±10◦ band-pair maps were derived similarly, and we constructed the AKARI
dust-band templates using these component maps as follows.

The publicly released AKARI maps have been processed with data in both the leading and
trailing directions obtained during different semi-annual seasons. To construct the ZE template of the
dust bands for the AKARI maps, we need to take into account the numbers of observations of the
leading and the trailing scans for each pixel. Figure 6 shows which of the leading and trailing scans
cover the relevant sky regions. During the ﬁrst 6 months, the leading scans observed the 315◦ < λ <
360◦ and 0◦ <
= λ < 135◦ regions, while the trailing scans covered 135◦ < λ < 315◦. Over the next 6
months, 135◦ < λ < 315◦ was covered by the leading scans, and 315◦ < λ < 360◦ and 0◦ <
= λ < 135◦
by the trailing scans. During the last 4 months, the leading scans observed the 315◦ < λ < 360◦ and
0◦ <

= λ < 65◦ regions, while 135◦ < λ < 245◦ was covered by the trailing scans (see ﬁgure 6).

Based on the conditions discussed above, we combined leading (L) and trailing (T) dust-band

maps to construct the AKARI ZE dust-band template, as follows:
• 0◦ <
• 65◦ <

= λ < 65◦: (2L+T)/3;
= λ < 135◦: (L+T)/2;

= λ < 295◦: (L+T)/2;
= λ < 360◦: (2L+T)/3.

• 135◦ <
• 245◦ <
• 295◦ <
The resulting dust-band templates for the AKARI maps in the four FIS bands are shown in ﬁgure 7.
The AKARI dust-band template thus obtained was subtracted from the all-sky map, for each
band (see ﬁgure 8). We can reduce the residual contribution of the ZE to <
∼ 0.5 MJy sr−1 near the
ecliptic plane by subtracting these dust-band maps from the AKARI far-IR all-sky maps (see ﬁgure 8
and ﬁgure 3).

4 Discussion

4.1 Dust-band structures

In previous studies, structure in the dust bands was mainly discussed based on IRAS and DIRBE data
at 25 µm, because the band structure, in particular of the ±10◦ dust band, is faint at wavelengths
longer than 60 µm (Sykes 1988; Spiesman et al. 1995; Reach et al. 1997). In the AKARI maps, we

can detect the ±10◦ band structure much more clearly in the 65 µm and 90 µm bands, compared
with the DIRBE maps. We derived the heliocentric distances of dust bands from the phase difference
based on the AKARI 90 µm map: 1.86 a.u. and 2.16 a.u. for the ±1.◦4/2.◦1 and the ±10◦ bands,
respectively. Reach (1992) found the heliocentric distances of 1.32 ± 0.05 a.u. and 2.04 ± 0.04 a.u.
using IRAS data. Based on the DIRBE data, Spiesman et al. (1995) derived the parallactic distances
of 1.37± 0.17 a.u. and 2.05± 0.13 a.u., while Reach et al. (1997) found 1.7 ± 0.2 a.u. and 2.4 ± 0.3
a.u., respectively. Although the heliocentric distances estimated with the AKARI far-IR data are
consistent with that of previous studies, AKARI results of the ±1.◦4/2.◦1 band is slightly larger than
those derived in previous studies. Nesvorn´y et al. (2006) made the simulations of orbital evolution for
the dust particles released from the Karin and Veritas family. They estimated the relative contribution
to the total IR surface brightness from particles at various distances, and suggest that the contribution
of particles at further than 2 a.u. is stronger in the IRAS 60 µm than that at shorter wavelengths. They
also found that large particles (∼ 500 µm) interact with strong secular resonances at the heliocentric
distance ≈ 2 a.u., while rapidly drifting small particles only experience modest perturbations. This
suggests that the larger grains at > 2 a.u. are dominant for the ±10◦ band, while smaller dust grains at
< 2 a.u contribute to the ±1.◦4/2.◦1 dust band. Since AKARI results are mainly based on the 90 µm
and 140 µm band data, large dust particles at further heliocentric distances (> 2 a.u.) contribute to
the AKARI results more signiﬁcantly than that in the IRAS results.

We ﬁtted the ±1.◦4/2.◦1 band with a single Gaussian function. Weak but sharp structures
(< 0.5 MJy sr−1 on scales of a few degrees) remaining near the ecliptic plane in the ZE-subtracted
N60 and WIDE-S maps (see ﬁgure 3 and ﬁgure 8) can probably be attributed to the ±2.◦1 band,
because the separation of this band pair is ∼ 4◦. It has been suggested that the ±1.◦4 band originates
from the breakup of the Beagle asteroid family < 10 Myr ago, while the ±2.◦1 band may have come
from the Karin asteroid family, which formed around 5.8 Myr ago (Nesvorn´y et al. 2003; Nesvorn´y et
al. 2008). It is likely that a broad ±1.◦4 band can be mainly attributed to the older Beagle family and
that the ±2.◦1 dust band originating from the recent breakup of the Karin family still exhibits sharp,
well-deﬁned structures.

To see the ﬁne structure of these two ±1.◦4 and ±2.◦1 bands, we created the “difference map”
image at near the ecliptic plane with the 0.◦05 resolution. Similar to ﬁgure 3, the image is centered
at ecliptic longitude λ = 125◦ and latitude β = 0◦, covering a 10◦ × 20◦ area in the leading direction,
because this region is free of signiﬁcant galactic dust emission. The image is spatially ﬁltered by
removing a boxcar average of 1◦ width in the similar way to Reach et al. (1997) and Spiesman et
al. (1995), and we constructed a proﬁle of the surface brightness as a function of ecliptic latitude,
coadding in 10◦ longitude ranges. The latitudinal proﬁle is shown in ﬁgure 9. The proﬁle shows four

individual peaks that are also seen in the ﬁgure 9 based on the IRAS 25 µm data in Reach et al. (1997).
This result demonstrates the advantage of the AKARI data for the investigation of the ﬁner-scale dust
band structures in the far-IR regime.

In addition to the major bands at ±1.◦4/2.◦1 and ±10◦, a weak ±17◦ band pair, and potential
±6◦ and ±13◦ band pairs have been suggested in previous studies (Sykes 1988; Reach et al. 1997;
Ishiguro et al. 1999a). These fainter band pairs are not apparent in the AKARI maps, although the
±17◦ band pair may have been detected (see also ﬁgure 3). These bands will be discussed based on
higher-resolution maps and Fourier-ﬁltering techniques in a forthcoming paper. In the present analysis
we simply adopted Gaussian proﬁles for the ﬁtting, although a Gaussian shape is not theoretically
motivated. To improve the dust-band template maps, we will consider a more realistic model for the
dust bands that has been proposed on physical grounds (e.g., Sykes & Greenberg 1986; Reach et al.
1997) in future analysis.

The dust properties of the asteroidal dust bands at wavelengths longer than 100 µm remain
poorly known because the ZE brightness rapidly becomes faint at longer far-IR wavelengths. IRAS
was not equipped with bands longer than 100 µm. Although DIRBE carried 140 µm and 240 µm
bands, the spatial resolution and the data quality of these bands were not good and no dust bands

21

were identiﬁed at the DIRBE 140 µm or 240 µm bands (Spiesman et al. 1995). Although AKARI
is equipped with WIDE-L (140 µm) and N160 (160 µm) bands with a higher spatial resolution than
DIRBE, the asteroidal dust bands apparently cannot be identiﬁed in either the 140 µm or the 160 µm
images. Based on data from DIRBE and the Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) in-
strument onboard COBE, it has been suggested that the ZE spectrum exhibits a break at λ ∼ 150 µm
and that the emissivity becomes wavelength-dependent, falling off as λ−2, at wavelengths longer than
150 µm (Fixsen & Dwek 2002). In ﬁgure 2 of Fixsen & Dwek (2002), the emissivity of the ZE
spectrum actually decreases from ∼ 100 µm onwards. Non-detection of asteroidal dust bands in
the AKARI WIDE-L and N160 bands may support the emissivity decrease in the longer-wavelength
regime.

The peak positions of the circumsolar-ring component are naturally almost all located near the
ecliptic plane. They do not show any clear sinusoidal change, because AKARI observed the dust in
the circumsolar ring near the Earth’s orbit (see ﬁgure 4). IRAS and COBE/DIRBE conﬁrmed that the
circumsolar-ring component is brighter in the direction trailing the Earth than in the leading direction
(Dermott et al. 1994; Reach et al. 1995). Dermott et al. (1994) suggested that the “total brightness”
trailing the Earth was greater than that leading the Earth by ∼ 3–4% in the 12–60 µm bands. In
the AKARI difference map based on the 90 µm and 140 µm bands, we can see the trailing–leading
asymmetry, but the asymmetry in the “total ZE brightness” is less than 3%. (Keep in mind that the
smooth cloud component of the ZE has already been subtracted from the AKARI maps.) It is likely
that the IRAS 12–60 µm bands observed a region closer to the Earth and of higher density than that
probed by the AKARI 90 µm band.

4.2 Data quality of the AKARI ZE-subtracted maps

Contributions from small-scale ZE structures remain present in the publicly released AKARI images.
The estimated intensities of the residual emission in the AKARI FIR images reach a maximum near
the ecliptic plane of < 5 MJy sr−1 and < 4 MJy sr−1 for the N60 and WIDE-S bands, respectively (Doi
et al. 2015; Takita et al. 2015). Using the AKARI dust-band template maps derived in this paper, we
can reduce the residual ZE contribution in the AKARI far-IR all-sky survey maps to <
∼ 0.5 MJy sr−1
near the ecliptic plane. Since interstellar dust emission mainly contributes to the ZE-subtracted far-IR
maps, we compared the ZE-subtracted AKARI data in the N60 and WIDE-S bands with the Galactic
dust emission data. We do not consider the WIDE-L and N160 bands here, because the contribution
of the ZE is negligible for these bands. We used the Galactic 100 µm emission map of Schlegel et
al. (1998), which we refer to as i100, because it was constructed using far-IR data from IRAS and

22

DIRBE, and it is currently the most widely used dust emission for a variety of astronomical studies.
Figure 10 shows a pixel-to-pixel (0.◦2 × 0.◦2) comparison of the AKARI intensity and the i100 map
at high Galactic latitudes (|b| > 25◦). We use the i100 map without any modiﬁcation considering
the difference in wavelengths. For comparison, we divide the sky into three ecliptic latitude regions:
0◦ < |β| < 30◦ (low latitude), 30◦ < |β| < 50◦ (mid latitude) and 50◦ < |β| < 90◦ (high latitude).
The asteroidal dust bands and the circumsolar-ring components mainly contribute to the low-latitude
region, while the high-latitude region (|β| > 50◦) is negligibly affected by the dust bands.

Before subtracting the dust-band components, an excess can be seen owing to dust-band emis-
sion in the low-latitude region in both the N60 and WIDE-S bands (see the left-hand panels of ﬁgure
10). The mid-latitude region in the N60 band also shows some excess compared with the high-
latitude region. After subtraction of the dust-band templates, all regions exhibit similar trends and
show a good correlation with the i100 surface brightness, except for the mid-latitude region in the
N60 band, which still exhibits some excess (see the right-hand panels of ﬁgure 10). For the intensity
uncertainties we use the standard deviations with respect to the i100 intensities based on the derived
correlations for various intensity ranges in the similar way to Takita et al. (2015), 0.158×Ii100−0.089
for N60 and 0.672× Ii100 + 0.644 for WIDE-S. The standard deviations are 23.0% at 1–2.5 MJy sr−1,
20.4% at 2.5–4.0 MJy sr−1 and 20.2% at 4.0–6.3 MJy sr−1 for N60 at low and high latitudes, while
they are 15.1% at 1–2.5 MJy sr−1, 13.6% at 2.5–4.0 MJy sr−1 and 9.7% at 4.0–6.3 MJy sr−1 for the
WIDE-S band for the all-sky data. We note that these estimates pertain to a spatial resolution of 0.◦2,
although Takita et al. (2015) derived uncertainties based on the DIRBE intensity with resolution of
0.◦7, excluding the region |β| < 40◦. We can achieve an equivalent level of ﬂux calibration for the
region at < 10 MJy sr−1 to Takita et al. (2015) even for |β| < 40◦ using the ZE-subtraction method
developed in this paper.

The residual intensity in the mid-latitude region remaining in the N60 band can also be seen in
the all-sky map (ﬁgure 8). The residual intensity at mid latitudes in the N60 band is ∼ 3 MJy sr−1 (see
ﬁgure 10). This may be attributed to the residuals after subtraction of the smooth cloud component
using the DIRBE ZE model. The DIRBE ZE model may be incomplete for use with the AKARI data,
even for the smooth cloud component.

5 Summary

We have investigated the geometry of the zodiacal dust bands in the AKARI far-IR maps and con-

Fig. 10. Scatter plots of the AKARI N60 (top) and WIDE-S (bottom) data vs. Galactic 100 µm emission (Schlegel et al. 1998) in three ecliptic latitude regions

at 0◦ < |β| < 30◦ (gray), 30◦ < |β| < 50◦ (green) and 50◦ < |β| < 90◦ (blue). Left: publicly released AKARI all-sky survey data before ZE subtraction.

Right: ZE-subtracted AKARI data. Red lines show linear ﬁts to the ZE-subtracted AKARI intensity as a function of i100. The mid-latitude data have been

excluded from the ﬁts to the N60-band observations. For the WIDE-S band, all data have been used for the ﬁtting. The black line in the N60-band panel

represents the intensity obtained by adding 3 MJy sr−1 to the best-ﬁtting results for the low- and high-latitude regions.

structure as well as that of the ±1.◦4/2.◦1 band in the 65 µm and 90 µm bands. In addition to the major
bands at ±1.◦4/2.◦1 and ±10◦, a weak ±17◦ band pair, and potential ±6◦ and ±13◦ band pairs have
been suggested in previous studies. These fainter band pairs are not apparent in the AKARI maps,
although a possible ±17◦ band pair may have been detected. No evident dust-band structures are iden-
tiﬁed in the 140 µm and 160 µm bands. Applying ﬁve-Gaussian ﬁts to the difference map composed
of the 90 µm and 140 µm bands, we constructed dust-band template maps for the four AKARI far-IR
bands. By subtracting the dust-band templates derived here, we can obtain ZE-subtracted AKARI far-
IR all-sky maps. With the ZE-subtracted maps, we can achieve an equivalent level of ﬂux calibration
to that of Takita et al. (2015), even for the regions at |β| < 40◦.
