A p-ADAPTIVE LOCAL DISCONTINUOUS GALERKIN LEVEL SET

METHOD FOR WILLMORE FLOW

RUIHAN GUO AND FRANCIS FILBET

Abstract. The level set method is often used to capture interface behavior in two or three
dimensions. In this paper, we present a combination of local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG)

method and level set method for simulating Willmore ﬂow. The LDG scheme is energy stable

and mass conservative, which are good properties comparing with other numerical methods.

In addition, to enhance the eﬃciency of the proposed LDG scheme and level set method, we

employ a p-adaptive local discontinuous Galerkin technique, which applies high order polyno-

mial approximations around the zero level set and low order ones away from the zero level set.

A major advantage of the level set method is that the topological changes are well deﬁned and

easily performed. In particular, given the stiﬀness of Willmore ﬂow, a high order semi-implicit

Runge-Kutta method is employed for time discretization, which allows larger time step. The

equations at the implicit time level are linear, we demonstrate an eﬃcient and practical multi-

grid solver to solve the equations. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the combination

of the LDG scheme and level set method provides an eﬃcient and practical approach when

simulating the Willmore ﬂow.

Key words: Willmore ﬂow, local discontinuous Galerkin method, p-adaptive, semi-implicit

scheme, level set method.

1. Introduction

The level set method was ﬁrst introduced by Osher and Sethian [13] in 1987, and it has had
large impact on computational methods for interface motion. In the past years, the level set
method attracted a lot of attention and was used for a wide variety of problems, including
ﬂuid dynamics, material sciences, computer vision and imaging processing. For an extensive
exposition of the level set method, we refer readers to the review paper [14] and the book [15].
In the level set method, the evolving family of interface Γt, t ≥ 0 is represented implicitly as
the zero level set of a continuous function which we will denote as φ : Ω × [0, T ] → R, where
Ω ⊂ R2 is a simply connected domain containing the whole family of evolving interfaces Γt,
t ∈ [0, T ]. Therefore, the interface Γt can be written as

Γt = (cid:8)x ∈ R2, φ(x, t) = 0(cid:9) .

There are certain advantages associated with this implicit Eulerian type of representation.

• The level set formulation is unchanged in higher dimensions, that is, it is easy to extend

to 3D.

• Topological changes such as merging and breaking in the evolving interface Γt are han-

dled naturally.

The level set formulation for Willmore ﬂow will typically result in a fourth order nonlinear
partial diﬀerential equation (PDE), e.g. see [10] for details. Beneˇs et al. developed a ﬁnite
volume method for spatial discretization in [1]. When the evolved surface is a graph, the
Willmore ﬂow converts to Willmore ﬂow of graphs, and numerical methods for Willmore ﬂow
of graphs attracted a lot of attention in the last decades. A semi-implicit numerical scheme for
the Willmore ﬂow of graphs with continuous ﬁnite element discretization and the convergence
analysis has been provided by Deckelnick and Dziuk in [9]. Finite diﬀerence discretization for
the Willmore ﬂow of graphs has been discussed in [12]. Xu and Shu [19] developed a local
discontinuous Galerkin method for Willmore ﬂow of graphs, and time discretization was by the
forward Euler method with a suitably small time step for stability.

The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is a class of ﬁnite element methods using com-
pletely discontinuous basis functions, which are usually chosen as piecewise polynomials. It
was ﬁrst introduced in 1973 by Reed and Hill [16] for solving the linear time dependent neutron
transport equation. Later, the DG method was developed for solving the nonlinear hyperbolic
conservation laws by Cockburn et al. in a series of papers [4, 5, 6, 7].

These discontinuous Galerkin methods were generalized to solve the PDEs containing higher
than ﬁrst order derivatives, i.e. the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method. The ﬁrst
LDG method was designed to solve a convection diﬀusion equation (with second derivatives)
by Cockburn and Shu [8]. The idea of LDG methods is to suitably rewrite a higher order PDE
into a ﬁrst order system, then apply the DG method to the system. A key ingredient for the
success of such methods is the correct design of interface numerical ﬂuxes, which should be
designed to guarantee stability. For a detailed description about the LDG methods for high

LOCAL DISCONTINUOUS GALERKIN LEVEL SET METHOD FOR WILLMORE FLOW

order time dependent PDEs, we refer the readers to [20]. The DG and LDG methods have
several attractive properties, for example:

(1) The order of accuracy can be locally determined in each cell, thus allowing for eﬃcient

p adaptivity.

(2) These methods can be used on arbitrary triangulations, even those with hanging nodes,

thus allowing for eﬃcient h adaptivity.

(3) These methods have excellent parallel eﬃciency.

In this paper, we present the level set method for computing evolution of the Willmore ﬂow
of embedded surfaces, and one of the major advantages of level set method is their ability to
easily handle topological changes. Then we develop a high order local discontinuous Galerkin
method for solving level set formulation of the Willmore ﬂow. The basis functions of LDG
method can be completely discontinuous, which leads that the order of accuracy can be locally
determined in each cell, i.e. p-adaptivity. To improve the eﬃciency of the proposed methods,
a p-adaptive technique is applied here to capture the evolution of the interface.

Another main diﬃculty when solving the Willmore ﬂow numerically is that it is stiﬀ, and
explicit time discretization methods suﬀer from extremely small time step restriction for stabil-
ity, of the form ∆t ≤ C∆x4, which is not eﬃcient, especially for long time simulation. It would
therefore be desirable to develop implicit or semi-implicit time marching techniques to alleviate
this problem.
In [18], three eﬃcient time discretization techniques were explored, these are
the semi-implicit spectral deferred correction (SDC) method, the additive Runge-Kutta (ARK)
method and the exponential time diﬀerencing (ETD) method. These methods are mainly based
on a splitting of stiﬀ and non stiﬀ diﬀerential operators, which is particularly eﬃcient for semi-
linear PDEs, but for quasi-linear equations, like for Willmore ﬂows, fully nonlinear solver would
be required. Thus we will employ here a high order semi-implicit Runge-Kutta method [2, 11].
The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we review the level set formulation
for Willmore ﬂow and get a highly nonlinear fourth order PDE. In Section 3, we present
the formulation of the local discontinuous Galerkin method and the p-adaptive technique for
solving the Willmore ﬂow. Section 4 contains a simple description of the high order semi-
implicit Runge-Kutta method. Numerical experiments are presented in Section 5, testing the
performance of p-adaptive local discontinuous Galerkin level set method for Willmore ﬂow.
Finally, we give concluding remarks in Section 6.

2. Level set formulation for Willmore flow

In the level set method, the evolving family of interface Γt, t ≥ 0 is represented implicitly as

the zero level set of a continuous function φ. Therefore, the interface Γt can be written as

Γt = (cid:8)x ∈ R2, φ(x, t) = 0(cid:9) .

In order to obtain the Willmore ﬂow, it is necessary to reformulate the equation in terms of
φ(t), H(t) and their derivatives.

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that |∇φ| (cid:54)= 0 on Γt. Then the unit normal vector to

a level curve of φ can be deﬁned as

(2.2)
Let us denote the following auxiliary functions Q = |∇φ| and ω = Q H. Then, by the
derivation in [10], a level set formulation of Willmore ﬂow is given as follows:

which is a projection into a tangential space of the curve representing the zero level set of φ.

The Willmore ﬂow (2.3) is subjected to the initial condition
φ(x, 0) = φ0(x), x ∈ Ω,

where the initial function φ0(x) is a signed distance function, i.e. φ0(x) = dist(x, Γ0), for any
x ∈ Ω. The initial condition satisﬁes the following property

(2.4)

|∇φ0(x)| = 1.

One of the major advantages of level set methods is their ability to easily handle topological
changes. However, we have found this not to be the case for Willmore ﬂow because of the lack
of a maximum principle. Indeed, two surfaces both undergoing an evolution by Willmore ﬂow
may intersect in ﬁnite time. Therefore, the level set formulation for Willmore ﬂow will lead to
singularities in general, i.e. ∇φ = 0 in ﬁnite time. To handle these diﬃculties, it is necessary to

introduce a suitable regularization technique. For a ﬁxed regularization parameter 0 < ε (cid:28) 1,
we deﬁne

Qε = (cid:112)ε + |∇φ|2

(2.5)

and replace all occurrences of Q in (2.3) by Qε.

3. Numerical method

With the level set formulation for Willmore ﬂow, we need to discrete equation (2.3) to capture
the movement of the interface (zero level set). It would therefore be desirable to develop high
order numerical scheme in both space and time to obtain high resolution. In this section, we
will consider the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method for the Willmore ﬂow (2.3).
3.1. Notation. We consider a subdivision Th of Ω with shape-regular elements K. Let Eh
denote the union of the boundary faces of elements K ∈ Th, i.e. Eh = ∪K∈Th∂K, and E0 =
Eh \ ∂Ω.

In order to describe the ﬂux functions, we need to introduce some notations. Let e be an
interior face shared by the “left” and “right” elements KL and KR and deﬁne the normal
vectors ν L and ν R on e pointing exterior to KL and KR, respectively. For our purpose “left”
and “right” can be uniquely deﬁned for each face according to any ﬁxed rule. For example, we
choose ν 0 as a constant vector. The left element KL to the face e requires that ν L · ν 0 < 0,
and the right one KR requires ν L · ν 0 ≥ 0. If ψ is a function on KL and KR, but possibly
discontinuous across e, let ψL denote (ψ|KL)|e and ψR denote (ψ|KR)|e, the left and right trace,
respectively.

Let P k(K) be the space of polynomials of degree at most k ≥ 0 on K ∈ Th. The ﬁnite

Vh =

ϕ ∈ L2(Ω), ϕ|K ∈ P k(K),

∀ K ∈ Th

(cid:111)

and

Similar to the development in [19], it turns out that we can take the simple choices such that

(cid:98)s|e = sL,

(cid:98)v|e = vL,

(cid:98)φ|e = φR.
is taking(cid:98)s,(cid:98)v and (cid:98)φ from opposite sides, and(cid:98)q and(cid:98)ω from opposite sides.

(cid:98)ω|e = ωL,

(cid:98)q|e = qR,

We remark that the choice for the numerical ﬂuxes (3.4) is not unique. In fact, the crucial part

Remark 3.1. The solution to the LDG scheme is mass conservative, by choosing the test
function ϕ = 1 in equation (3.3).

Remark 3.2. Similar to the proof in [19], the solution to the LDG scheme (3.3) with numerical
ﬂuxes (3.4) satisﬁes the following energy stability

3.3. A p-adaptive technique. In the level set method, we aim to capture the interface be-
havior. As a result, we are mainly interested in the position near the zero level set, which
motivates us to use adaptive technique. The basis functions of the LDG method we discuss
in this paper can be discontinuous, so it has certain adaptive ﬂexibility, such as, the order of
accuracy can be locally determined in each cell.

Our aim is to apply a higher order polynomial approximation around the zero level set to
achieve high order accuracy, whereas in the regions far away from the zero level set, we apply
lower order polynomial approximations, which is similar as what is described by Yan and Osher
in [21]. We explain the p-adaptive technique in detail with Figure 3.1. In Figure 3.1, we apply
P 2 approximation near the zero level set, which are the domain ﬁlled with dark cells. While
for the domain two or three cells away from the zero level set, it is not necessary to use high
order approximation, thus P 1 approximation is enough.

As we know, in the implementation of the p-adaptive technique, it is essential to employ a
ﬂag to mark “near the zero level set”. By the deﬁnition of the level set method, it is reasonable

to use the following ﬂag: (cid:40)P 2 approximation,

(3.5)

P 1 approximation,

|φ| ≤ 1.5h,
|φ| > 1.5h,

if

where |φ| is the absolute value of φ. With the proposed p-adaptive technique, we can improve
the eﬃciency of the local discontinuous Galerkin method for level set equation.

4. Time discretization

As we know, the Willmore ﬂow (2.3) is a highly nonlinear fourth order PDE, explicit time
integration methods lead to an extremely small time step restriction for stability, but not
for accuracy.
It would therefore be desirable to develop a semi-implicit time discretization
technique to alleviate this problem.

Figure 3.1. Explanation of p-adaptive technique.

In this section, we employ a high order semi-implicit Runge-Kutta method. Based on the
work in [2], the main idea of the semi-implicit method is to apply two diﬀerent Runge-Kutta
methods. Consider the ODE system

 du

dt
u(0) = u0,

= H(t, u(t), u(t)),

t ∈ [0, T ]

(4.1)

(4.2)

where the function H : R × Rm × Rm → Rm is suﬃciently diﬀerentiable and the dependence
on the second argument of H is non-stiﬀ, while the dependence on the third argument is stiﬀ.
The semi-implicit Runge-Kutta method is based on the partitioned Runge-Kutta method, so
we will ﬁrst give a simple description for the partitioned Runge-Kutta methods. We consider
autonomous diﬀerential equations in the partitioned form,

 dy

(t) = F(y(t), z(t)),
(t) = G(y(t), z(t)),

where y(t) ∈ Rm, z(t) ∈ Rn, F : Rm × Rn → Rm, G : Rm × Rn → Rn and F, G ∈ C1(Rm ×
Rn). y(t0) = y0, z(t0) = z0 are the initial conditions. Then we can express the partitioned
Runge-Kutta methods by applying two diﬀerent Runge-Kutta methods as the following Butcher

For practical reasons, in order to simplify the computations, we consider that ˆA is a strictly
lower triangular matrix and A is a lower triangular matrix for the implicit part. In addition,
the coeﬃcients satisfy:

To derive a semi-implicit Runge-Kutta scheme, we ﬁrst rewrite the non autonomous diﬀer-
ential equation (4.1) as an autonomous system where we double the number of variable, that
is,

By a uniqueness argument the solution to (4.6) corresponds to the one of (4.1), but now this
system is written as an autonomous partitioned system (4.2), with y(t) = (t, u(t)), F = (1,H)
and z(t) = u(t), G = H and y(t0) = (t0, u0), z(t0) = u0 are the initial conditions.

Applying the partitioned Runge-Kutta scheme (4.4)-(4.5) to system (4.6), we can get a high
order semi-implicit Runge-Kutta method for (4.1) : the ﬁrst component of the ﬁrst equation

After the LDG spatial discretization for the Willmore ﬂow (2.3), we can apply the semi-
implicit scheme (4.7)-(4.9) by writing the system of ODE in the form of (4.1) with the compo-
nent u(t) treated explicitly, the component v(t) treated implicitly and

By algorithm (4.7)-(4.9), the second variable of equation (4.1) is treated explicitly and the

equations (4.8) at each time step. The overall performance highly depends on the performance
of the solver. Traditional iterative solution methods such as Gauss-Seidel method suﬀers from
slow convergence rates, especially for large systems. To enhance the eﬃciency of the high
order semi-implicit time marching method, we will apply the multigrid solver to solve algebraic
equations (4.8) in this paper. And for a detailed description of the multigrid solver, we refer
the readers to Trottenberg et al. [17] and Brandt [3].

5. Numerical results

In this section, we present some numerical results for the Willmore ﬂow. In addition, we use
p-adaptive LDG spatial discretization (P 2 approximation near the zero level set, P 1 approx-
imation away from the zero level set) coupled with a high order semi-implicit Runge-Kutta
method, which is high order accurate in both time and space, allowing larger time step. Each
time step we solve the linear algebraic equations by multigrid solver. We ﬁrst present various
representative examples of shape relaxation, for example, the motions of an ellipse, a square,
an asteroid and a singular curve. Next, we will show the topological changes, such as merging
and breaking.

5.1. Accuracy test. In this example, we consider the accuracy test for one-dimensional Will-
more ﬂow. We consider the exact solution

(5.1)

φ(x, t) = 0.05 sin(x) cos(t)

solution.

To show the eﬀect of diﬀerent regularization parameters ε on the corresponding errors and
orders of accuracy, we report the L2 and L∞ errors and the numerical orders of accuracy at
time T = 0.5 with uniform meshes in Table 5.1. We can see that the method with P k elements
gives (k + 1)-th order of accuracy with diﬀerent scales of the regularization parameters ε.

5.2. Towards a circle. We ﬁrst perform a series of numerical simulations, where the initial
level sets describe two convex curves, a non-convex curve and a singular curve. Hence it is
expected that the level set approaches a circle for large time, which compares very well with
numerical calculations performed by Beneˇs et al. [1].

The motion of an ellipse. We consider the motion of an ellipse as shown in Figure 5.1. For
large time, the level set asymptotically approaches a circle. Here, we approximate the Willmore
ﬂow with ε = h on a 64 × 64 grid for the computational domain Ω = [0, 4] × [0, 4]. Here, we
adopt a p-adaptive LDG method for spatial discretization and a second order semi-implicit
Runge-Kutta method with a time step of ∆t = 0.001h, which is very large compare to that of
an explicit time marching method (∆t = Ch4).

The motion of a square. We now consider an initial data, where the initial level set is a square,
that is, it has sharp corners. We report the numerical results in Figure 5.2, which shows the
evolution of a square into a circle. We approximate the Willmore ﬂow with ε = h on a 64 × 64
grid for the computational domain Ω = [0, 4] × [0, 4]. Here, we also adopt a second order
semi-implicit Runge-Kutta method with a time step of ∆t = 0.001h.

The motion of an asteroid. In Figure 5.3, we present the motion of another non-convex curve
with very sharp corners. The numerical methods and parameters are chosen to be the same
with those in the previous example. Also the initial asteroid is evolved to be a circle.

The motion of a singular curve. We consider an initial data, where the initial level set is a
singular curve. We report the numerical results in Figure 5.4, which shows the evolution of a
singular curve into a circle. We approximate the Willmore ﬂow with ε = 10h and ε = 10h2,
respectively on a 64× 64 grid for the computational domain Ω = [−4, 4]× [−4, 4], which shows
similar patterns with diﬀerent regularization parameter ε.

5.3. Topology changes. Finally, in this example, we present two examples to illustrate a
topological change under Willmore ﬂow, which is one of the major advantages of level set
methods. However, level set methods for this problem suﬀer from an additional diﬃculty.
The Willmore ﬂow does not have a maximum principle, which leads to that two surfaces

both undergoing an evolution by Willmore ﬂow my intersect in ﬁnite time. To handle these
diﬃculties, it is important to choose the regularization parameter ε to avoid a blow up of the
gradient of φ in ﬁnite time. In addition, it is important to choose small time steps to temporally
resolve the rapid transients that occur at a topological change.

Figure 5.5 presents the merging of two square-like shapes under the level set evolution of
Willmore ﬂow. We can see the two square-like shapes merge and eventually evolve to a single
circle. Here, we choose ε = 5h, and the time step size is ∆t = 10−6. Since for such small time
step, we use here a ﬁrst order semi-implicit time marching method. Certainly, we can use
explicit Runge-Kutta method here, but because of the severe time step restriction of explicit
methods, the time step must be very small, which takes about ∆t ≈ 10−9.

In Figure 5.6, we show another example of topological change. The initial conﬁguration
consists of two almost touching surfaces-the inner surface being a circle and the outer surface

ε = 5h, and the time step size ∆t = 10−6.

6. Concluding remarks

In this work, we have developed a local discontinuous Galerkin method for a level set for-
mulation of Willmore ﬂow. The scheme is mass conservative and energy stable. In the level
set method, we are mainly interested in capturing the movement of the interface. Therefore, it
is reasonable and natural to combine our local discontinuous Galerkin scheme with p-adaptive
technique to improve the eﬃciency of the method. To relax the severe time step restriction
of explicit time integration methods for stability and achieve high order temporal accuracy,
a semi-implicit Runge-Kutta method is adopted. The equations at the implicit time level are
linear and we employ an eﬃcient multigrid solver to solve them. Numerical experiments demon-
strate that the proposed methods are eﬃcient for Willmore ﬂow, and the level set method can
easily handle topological changes.
