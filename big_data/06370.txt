Abstract

Micro-Laue diﬀraction and simultaneous rainbow-ﬁltered micro-diﬀraction were used

to measure accurately the full strain tensor and the lattice orientation distribution

at the sub-micron scale in highly strained, suspended Ge micro-devices. A numerical

approach to obtain the full strain tensor from the deviatoric strain measurement alone

is also demonstrated and used for faster full strain mapping. We performed the mea-

surements in a series of micro-devices under either uniaxial or biaxial stress and found

of Laue micro-diﬀraction for the investigation of highly strained micro-devices.

1. Introduction

The development of integrated laser sources compatible with microelectronic tech-

nologies is currently one of the main challenges for silicon photonics. Since Ge can be

CMOS compatible, the interest in strained Ge has signiﬁcantly increased over the last

few years (Dutt et al., 2012). In theory, straining Ge can improve the emission prop-

erties by reducing the energy diﬀerence between the indirect L valley and the direct

Γ valley. The energy diﬀerence is expected to vanish for 4.7% uniaxial or 2.0% biaxial

tensile strain (El Kurdi et al., 2010b; Aldaghri et al., 2012; Sukhdeo et al., 2014). Dif-

ferent methods are currently developed to strain Ge layers, either using internal strain

redistribution (S¨uess et al., 2013; Gassenq et al., 2015), or external stress application

using stressor layers such as SiN (Ghrib et al., 2013; Guilloy et al., 2015) or mechanical

apparatus (e.g. bulge testing) (El Kurdi et al., 2010a; S´anchez-P´erez et al., 2011; Boz-

tug et al., 2013). Strain measurements are usually done by micro-Raman spectroscopy

(El Kurdi et al., 2010a; Boztug et al., 2013; Ghrib et al., 2013; Ure˜na et al., 2013).

Raman spectroscopy has the advantage of being relatively well spatially resolved, fast

and readily available in laboratories. Yet it is mainly limited to the measurement of the

Raman spectral shift, which in turn has to be interpreted as a function of the mate-

rials, the nature of the strain (Cerdeira et al., 1972; Wolf, 1996) and the light polar-

ization (Mermoux et al., 2010). Monochromatic synchrotron X-ray micro-diﬀraction

measurements were also performed in Ge devices (Capellini et al., 2013; Etzelstor-

fer et al., 2014; Ike et al., 2015; Chahine et al., 2015; Keplinger et al., 2016). Direct

measurements of the atomic planes spacing with sub-micron resolution were obtained.

However several orientations had to be measured successively in order to resolve the

full strain tensor. The diﬀerent probing volumes of the diﬀerent orientations further

complicated the analysis. Laue micro-diﬀraction is well suited for strain and orienta-

tion mapping in miscellaneous materials (Chung & Ice, 1999; Tamura et al., 1999; Ice

& Larson, 2000; MacDowell et al., 2001; Larson et al., 2002; Tamura et al., 2002b;

Tamura et al., 2002a; Tamura et al., 2003; Rogan et al., 2003; Ice et al., 2005; Maaß

et al., 2006; Kunz et al., 2009; Ice & Pang, 2009; Kirchlechner et al., 2011b; Kirchlech-

ner et al., 2011a; Robach et al., 2011; Villanova et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; Richard

et al., 2012; Hofmann et al., 2013; Ibrahim et al., 2015; Dejoie et al., 2015). Recently,

local Laue micro-diﬀraction measurements of the strain have also been performed in

nano-objects, such as Au nanowires (Leclere et al., 2015) or Ge nanowires (Guilloy

et al., 2015). However, the nature of the white beam limits the measurement to the

deviatoric strain, which needs to be interpreted to access the lattice parameter value.

Since the initial works on the Laue micro-diﬀraction technique, it was recognized

that the additional ability to measure the energy of at least one Bragg reﬂection would

enable the determination of the full strain tensor (see e.g. (Chung & Ice, 1999; Tamura

et al., 1999)). Robach et al. (Robach et al., 2013) have recently demonstrated that

this energy measurement could be performed in a white beam conﬁguration, i.e. in the

absence of a monochromator, using the so-called “rainbow-ﬁlter” technique. This tech-

nique is akin to a reverse monochromatic ﬁltering where speciﬁc energies are removed

from the incident spectrum using a diamond plate in diﬀraction conditions upstream

of the sample. Such method combines both advantages from poly- and monochromatic

micro-diﬀraction, i.e. a complete determination of both sample orientation and strain.

Here we report on rainbow-ﬁltered Laue micro-diﬀraction measurements of the full

strain tensor in Ge microstructures, in which the strain is redistributed and con-

centrated in a small region. We ﬁrst measured the deviatoric strain and the lattice

tilts distribution in uniaxially and biaxially stressed micro-devices using Laue micro-

IUCr macros version 2.1.10: 2016/01/28

4

diﬀraction, thus unambiguously separating the tilt and strain contributions. We then

obtained the full strain tensor in the center region of the microstructures using the

rainbow-ﬁlter technique and conﬁrmed the absence of normal stress on the free sur-

faces. The latter observation was used to numerically retrieve the full strain tensor

from (standard) Laue micro-diﬀraction measurements alone. We could thus further

extend the full strain tensor determination to the complete mapping of the micro-

devices. Our work demonstrates the high potential of standard and rainbow-ﬁltered

Laue micro-diﬀraction for the investigation of inhomogenously strained microstruc-

tures.

2.1. Sample preparation

2. Materials and methods

Ge suspended micro-bridges and micro-crosses were processed in optical GeOI sub-

strates with a small built-in biaxial tensile strain (0.16% at room temperature) (Reboud

et al., 2015; Reboud et al., 2016). This initial strain was concentrated in smaller regions

using the approach initially proposed for Si micro-bridges (Minamisawa et al., 2012):

the 0.35 µm-thick Ge layer was patterned in the shape of micro-bridges or micro-

crosses with large stretching pads on each side using e-beam lithography followed by

dry etching in an inductively coupled plasma reactor. The membrane is released by

etching the underlying oxide using vapor HF and ethanol. This results in strain relax-

ation in the large pads and a larger biaxial or uniaxial tensile strain is imposed to the

small center region (Figure 1(a)). The strain state in the center region can be tuned

by the diﬀerent design parameters, e.g. number of pads, size of the pads and of the

central region, as well as the relative orientations of the micro-structure and of the

crystal axis. A detailed studies of their inﬂuence has been presented elsewhere (S¨uess
et al., 2013; Gassenq et al., 2015). Figure 1 presents the studied designs for (cid:104)100(cid:105)

2.2. Finite Elements Method simulations

The strain redistribution was simulated using the 2 dimensional Finite Elements

Method (FEM) with the COMSOL Multiphysics software. The germanium second

order stiﬀness parameters were used to account for the crystal anisotropy and the

elastic coeﬃcients were taken from Ref. (Levinshtein et al., 1996). An in-plane stress

corresponding to the 0.16% initial strain in the GeOI and a zero normal stress were

applied to the layer. We deﬁned a contour around the micro-bridge or micro-cross

corresponding to the under-etching front (dashed lines in Figure 1(b,c), u = 80 µm).

Outside this contour, the displacement of the Ge layer was set to zero, since it is

clamped by the underlying and much larger Si substrate, while inside the contour

the suspended Ge membrane was free to elastically relax. For comparison with strain

mapping measurements hereafter, the FEM simulations were convoluted with a Gaus-

sian function (0.8 µm full width at half-maximum) corresponding to the size of the

measurement probe.

2.3. Rainbow ﬁltered Laue micro-diﬀraction

The Laue micro-diﬀraction experiments were performed at beamline BM32 of the

European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Ulrich et al., 2011). The incoming white

beam (5-25 keV) was focused using non-dispersive Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors to a sub-
micron spot, typically 0.5 µm (horizontal) x 0.5 µm (vertical). Due to the 40◦ tilt

of the sample surface with respect to the horizontal plane, the vertical footprint of

the beam on the sample was about 0.8 µm, however. The sample was positioned

in the beam using a three-dimensional stage with 100 nm resolution. The relative

position of the sample and the X-ray spot was monitored using a multi-channel ana-

IUCr macros version 2.1.10: 2016/01/28

6

lyzer ﬂuorescence detector set to the Ge Kα ﬂuorescence line. The Laue diﬀraction
patterns from the sample were collected on a 2048 × 2048 pixel MarCCD charge-

coupled device (CCD) sensor with an eﬀective pixel size of 80 µm, positioned 70 mm

above the sample. Accurate position and angles of CCD pixels with respect to sample

and incoming beam directions were determined by the standard calibration proce-

dure on a stress-free Ge thick wafer (Chung & Ice, 1999). The orientation matrix and

the deviatoric strain tensor were calculated from the peak positions using the Laue-

Tools software (Micha & Robach, 2010). We further used the so-called rainbow-ﬁlter

technique to measure the energy of the Bragg reﬂections and therefore the lattice

parameters (Robach et al., 2013). A 300 µm-thick diamond plate was inserted in the

X-ray beam such that energies corresponding to diﬀractions by the diamond plate were

attenuated downstream of the plate. Rotating the diamond plate results in changing

the diﬀraction conditions so that a set of attenuated transmitted energies could be

scanned across the beam spectrum. After calibration of the energy ﬁlter with a known
material (here bulk (cid:104)111(cid:105) germanium), the relationship between the angular position

of the diamond plate and the attenuated energies could be established. The energy

of any Bragg reﬂection could then be accessed by scanning the diamond plate while

measuring the intensity of the Bragg reﬂection and correlating the observation of a

reduction in intensity with the angular position of the diamond plate.

3.1. Laue diﬀraction pattern measurements

3. Results and discussion

Typical Laue patterns measured in the center region of a series of micro-bridges are

shown in Figure 2. All the bridges were patterned on the same chip in a 0.35 µm Ge

layer thickness with 11 µm bridge length along the a axis and 1 µm width (l = 11 µm,

W = 51 µm and w = 1 µm in Figure 1(b)). Diﬀerent lengths L of the stretching pad

IUCr macros version 2.1.10: 2016/01/28

7

were measured, corresponding to diﬀerent strain states (Minamisawa et al., 2012).

The positions of the h0l peaks (e.g. 6 0 10 in Figure 2) vary monotonically with the

strain: the strains along a and c have opposite signs due to the Poisson eﬀect, thus

the scattering vector rotates around the b axis as the strain increases. As a result,

the scattering plane rotates as well and the position of the reﬂected beam moves on

the detector. On the opposite, the positions of the 0kl peaks (e.g. 0 ¯6 10 in Figure

2) do not change with the strain state since the symmetry is preserved in the (b, c)

plane. Due to the small Ge thickness, both Ge and Si Laue patterns can be observed.

Note that the circular shape of the Ge diﬀraction peaks is indicative of (i ) a good

homogeneity of strain and orientation, and (ii ) a lack of plastic relaxation at the beam

location for the samples probed. The small oﬀset between the Si and Ge peaks comes

from the small misalignment of the two wafers at the moment of their bonding during
GeOI fabrication (Reboud et al., 2015), typically lower than 0.25◦.

Figure 3 presents a typical diﬀraction pattern measured on the MarCCD detector.

The associated ﬁts of the maximum intensity of the diﬀracted peak are indicated

by circles for Ge and rectangles for Si. In order to extract only the Ge peaks from

the diﬀraction pattern measured in the center region of the bridge (Figure 3(a)), the

background was also measured in the Si substrate close to the bridge (Figure 3(b)).

The Si peaks were then removed by subtracting the two images (Figure 3(c)). Figure

3(d), (e) and (f) are zoom-in on the 337 and 226 diﬀraction peaks, where it clearly

appears that the Si peaks are removed by the background processing.

3.2. Lattice distortions and tilts mapping

On each Laue pattern, up to 80 of the most intense and well-deﬁned peaks were ﬁtted

using LaueTools with 8 independent parameters: 5 for the deviatoric strain tensor and

3 for the lattice orientation matrix. Figure 4 and 5 present maps of the crystallographic

angles and lattice tilts for the uniaxial design (W = 51 µm, w = 0.5 µm, L = 75 µm,

l = 12 µm and 1 µm ﬁllet radius in Fig. 1(b)) and the biaxial design (x = 140 µm,

d = 7 µm and 1 µm ﬁllet radius in Fig. 1(c)), respectively. The three crystallographic

angles α, β and γ describe the distortions of the cubic lattice while the three rotation

angles Rx, Ry and Rz are calculated from the lattice orientation matrix and describe

the rotations of the lattice around the x, y and z axis indicated in the ﬁgures. In the
case of the micro-bridge (Fig. 4), the in-plane lattice angle γ increases over 90◦ or
decreases under 90◦ by a few tenths of a degree on each side of the constriction, near

the ﬁllets. At the same locations, an in-plane rotation of the lattice of similar amplitude

is observed in the Rz map. The combination of these two eﬀects is illustrated by the

simple sketch in Fig. 4: the lattice is strongly deformed by shear strain along x on

each side of the constriction at the position of the ﬁllets, where the uniaxial symmetry

is broken (the width of the pad is much larger than that of the bridge). Such lattice

distortion may cause fractures in the ﬁllet region and can be overcome using grade

optimization (Nam et al., 2013). The out-of-plane rotations Rx and Ry also display

an interesting behavior: while the lattice tilts are negligible in the center region, a

rotation around the bridge axis (Rx) as well as a rotation perpendicular to the bridge

axis (Ry) are clearly observed in the pads. The Rx and Ry curvatures are sketched in

the insets of Fig. 4 and their opposite signs indicate an anticlastic deformation of the

micro-bridge, consistently with previous results from Etzelstorfer et al. (Etzelstorfer

et al., 2014). We note that in our case, the symmetry breaking between the top and

bottom surfaces may be due to remaining unetched layers or patches of Si (used as an

oxidation protection layer) on the bottom surface of the Ge stretching arms.

Similarly, the stretching pads of the micro-cross display particular lattice tilts and
distortions (Fig. 5). The lattice angle γ is remarkably larger than 90◦ in the vertical
(y-axis) pads and smaller than 90◦ in the horizontal (x-axis) pads while the in-plane

IUCr macros version 2.1.10: 2016/01/28

9

rotation angle Rz changes sign between the edges of each pad. Such behavior is dif-

ferent from the micro-bridge case where γ and Rz were correlated. This eﬀect can

be illustrated by the simple sketch in Fig. 5: since the x-axis and y-axis pads are

here aligned along [110] and [¯110] respectively, the γ angle will be reduced (increased)

when the lattice is stretched along x (y). Near the pad edges, a small lattice rota-

tion occurs to accommodate the changes in symmetry, mirrored along the center axis

of the pads and thus changing sign across the pad width. Accordingly, a vanishing

rotation is observed along the center axis of each pad. No signiﬁcant out-of-plane

lattice tilts are measurable. Finally, it can be seen that the orthorhombic symmetry

of the lattice is well preserved in the center region of both the micro-bridge and the
micro-cross (α = β = γ = 90◦) and no signiﬁcant lattice rotation can be observed in

these center regions, i.e. the regions of interest for strain concentration. This conﬁrms

the ideal character of the strain concentration approach in the narrowest part of the

micro-bridges and micro-crosses to get a homogenous, pure biaxial or uniaxial stress

without shear component.

3.3. Experimental full strain tensor measurement

In order to access the full strain tensor from the deviatoric strain and the lattice

tilts, we have performed rainbow-ﬁltered Laue diﬀraction. The full strain tensor can

be calculated from the combination of (i ) the deviatoric strain tensor measured using

standard Laue micro-diﬀraction, and (ii ) at least one d-spacing obtained from the

measurement of the energy (wavelength) of a Bragg diﬀraction peak. Indeed, all the

lattice distances calculated from the deviatoric strain tensor are proportional to the

actual strained lattice distances with the same constant scale factor. The measurement

of one actual lattice distance sets that scale factor. The advantages of measuring the

d-spacings using the rainbow-ﬁlter technique is that the beam is not translated, as

IUCr macros version 2.1.10: 2016/01/28

10

would be the case when using a double crystal or reﬂection monochromator. Thus the

optical axis remains the same during the Laue pattern collection and the deviatoric

strain tensor, lattice tilts and d-spacings are measured at the same time. The raw

orientation and axis of rotation of the rainbow-ﬁlter, i.e. the diamond plate, was mea-
sured using a secondary CCD detector. Then, calibration was performed using a (cid:104)111(cid:105)

bulk Ge sample (Robach et al., 2013). The quality of the calibration was then veriﬁed
by measuring several rainbow-ﬁltered Bragg reﬂections in a bulk (cid:104)001(cid:105) germanium

crystal, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Several intensity drops can be observed on the selected

Bragg reﬂections, corresponding to photons removed by upstream diﬀraction events in

the diamond plate. Since the orientation of the diamond plate is known for any rota-

tion angle, all the energies corresponding to a diﬀraction condition in the diamond

can be determined. These energies will be attenuated in the spectrum transmitted by

the diamond and impinging on the sample. The lines in Figure 6(b) display the corre-

sponding energies as a function of the diamond plate angle (the thicker the line, the

stronger the diﬀraction by the diamond plate and the stronger the downstream atten-

uation). Therefore, the rotation angle of the diamond plate at which a given Bragg

reﬂection from the sample is attenuated (Fig. 6(a)) gives the corresponding energy of

that particular reﬂection (circles in Fig. 6(b)). The corresponding lattice distance dhkl

can then be calculated using Equation 1.

dhkl =

E

2hc sin θ

(1)

where dhkl is the distance between hkl crystal planes, E is the energy of the Bragg

reﬂection (measured experimentally using the rainbow-ﬁlter technique), h is the Planck

constant, c the celerity of light in vacuum and θ is the Bragg angle (the pixel posi-

tion of the Laue peak on the detector gives the 2θ value). Note that the intensity

of a Bragg reﬂection from the sample may drop at diﬀerent angles due to diﬀerent

IUCr macros version 2.1.10: 2016/01/28

11

diﬀractions from the diamond plate. For instance, both detected attenuations of the

3¯39 reﬂection are indicated by the dashed vertical lines in Fig. 6. Such simultane-

ous energy determination provides an estimation of the inherent uncertainty of our

measurements.

Table 1 summarizes the measured energies of the Bragg reﬂections from the sample

(hklsample) from the attenuation due to the diﬀraction hklf ilter of the diamond plate.

Typical discrepancies between two energy determinations from two diﬀerent diﬀrac-
tions from the ﬁlter are below 8 eV, i.e. ∆E/E < 7 × 10−4. We obtained dhkl values

within a few 0.01% of the theoretical values expected for a perfect cubic crystal with

lattice parameter a0 = 5.6575˚A (Levinshtein et al., 1996). Thus, we estimate our typ-

ical experimental uncertainties to be about 0.05%. More details on the rainbow-ﬁlter

technique can be found in Ref. (Robach et al., 2013).

From the measurement of the Laue pattern, one obtains the relative lattice param-

eters a/b and a/c. Thus, ﬁxing arbitrarily the value of a, the lattice parameters can

be estimated within a constant scale factor. The actual lattice parameters u (u = a,

b or c) can then be calculated from the combination of estimated lattice parameter

uestimated, any estimated dhkl,estimated spacing and measured dhkl,exp spacing using:

u = uestimated

dhkl,exp

dhkl,estimated

The diagonal components of the full strain tensor are then simply given by:

εuu =

u − a0
a0

(2)

(3)

Note that the oﬀ-diagonal components of the full strain tensor are the same as those

of the deviatoric strain tensor. We now turn to the results in the micro-bridges shown in

Fig.2. The rainbow-ﬁlter measurements of the strain tensor components in the center

region of the bridges are reported in Table 2. A minimum of two diﬀracted peaks

IUCr macros version 2.1.10: 2016/01/28

12

have been measured in order to control the measurement reliability. The experimental

uncertainties, estimated from two diﬀerent Bragg reﬂections, are within 0.10% and

somewhat larger than for bulk Ge. A possible reason is the lower signal-to-noise ratio in

the thin membranes. The small negative in-plane shear component ε12 which increases

with the longitudinal strain, is explained by a small in-plane misalignement between

the axis of the micro-bridge and the crystallographic axis a. Accordingly, the out-of-

plane shear components ε23 and ε13 are equal, as expected from the symmetry.

While the rainbow-ﬁlter method provides an accurate measurement of the local full

strain tensor, it is hardly suitable for strain mapping since the diamond plate must

be scanned at each measurement position. In order to keep the mapping time within

reasonable limits (i.e. a few hours), we turned to a numerical determination of the full

strain tensor from the Laue diﬀraction patterns.

3.4. Full strain tensor calculation

The full strain tensor was calculated for each measurement location from the devia-

toric strain tensor using the following model. Since the micro-bridges and micro-crosses

are suspended, their top and bottom surfaces can be considered free of normal stress.

Using Voigt notation, the σ33 component of the stress can consequently be set to zero

in the second order generalized Hookes law:

et al., 1996). In particular

where εh is the hydrostatic strain. Thus, from Eq. 5 and 6 it follows that

(7)

All the strain components can then be computed using Eq. 6, Eq. 7, and the mea-
sured values of the deviatoric strain tensor ε(cid:48). Furthermore, the remaining stress

components can also be calculated from Eq. 4. Our numerical approach was veri-

ﬁed by confronting the measurements in the center region of micro-bridges using the

rainbow-ﬁlter technique and the calculated strain tensor. The results for the longitu-

dinal ε11 = εxx component measured in diﬀerent micro-bridges are shown in Fig. 7.

An excellent agreement is obtained, thus validating the numerical approach for faster

full strain tensor mapping.

3.5. Full strain mapping

Using the numerical approach introduced before, we could calculate the full tensor

from the measurements of the deviatoric strain tensor. The results are plotted in

Fig. 8 and 9, where the components of the full strain tensor are compared to FEM

simulations results. An excellent agreement is obtained for all components in the micro-

bridge, both in the center region and in the stretching pads (Fig. 8). The agreement

is also remarkable near the ﬁllets where the strain varies rapidly and changes sign,

even though the number of ﬁtted peaks in these regions is lower and the average

IUCr macros version 2.1.10: 2016/01/28

14

deviation of the ﬁt is larger due to a less homogeneous strain along the beam path

(not shown here). Figure 9 displays the results of FEM simulations and actual strain

measurements in the micro-cross along [110], [¯110] and [001], i.e. along each stretching

pad and perpendicularly to the membrane, respectively. The agreement is also very

good: the center region is under uniform biaxial strain and the larger strain regions

are located around the ﬁllets in the pads. The simulated strain in the stretching pads

away from the center region and the edges is uniaxial: the strain along the axis of

the pad is positive; the out-of-plane component is negative and the in-plane strain

perpendicular to the axis of the pad vanishes. The latter is expected since the Poisson

ratio for the [110] and [¯110] directions is about ten times smaller than that for the

[100] and [010] directions (Wortman & Evans, 1965). As mentionned earlier, the small

out-of-plane shear strain components in the stretching arms of the micro-bridges and

micro-crosses may be due small unetched layers or patches on the bottom surface.

Finally, ﬁgure 10 shows the proﬁle of the three diagonal components across the micro-

cross as measured using Laue micro-diﬀraction and as calculated with FEM, taking

into account the beam shape. The agreement is remarkable for all three components

simultaneously.

4. Conclusion

Using Laue diﬀraction measurements at the micrometer scale, we performed lattice

distortions and tilts mapping of Ge micro-structures. We observed homogeneous, pure

tetragonal strain in the center regions and rapidly varying strain at the junction with

the stretching pads, where lattice distortions were also evidenced. In order to assess the

full strain tensor in such devices, rainbow-ﬁltered measurements have been performed

and conﬁrmed the absence of normal stress on the free surfaces. As a result, full strain

tensor maps could be directly calculated from standard Laue micro-diﬀraction mea-

surements. Comparison with FEM modeling showed a very good agreement. There-

fore, our work demonstrates that the combination of the rainbow technique with Laue

micro-diﬀraction leads to unambiguous strain and tilt mapping in crystalline strained

micro-structures, such as GeOI micro-bridges or micro-crosses.

Synopsis

The lattice tilts and full strain tensor are measured in Ge micro-devices under uniaxial or
biaxial stress using standard and rainbow-ﬁltered Laue micro-diﬀraction. Maps with sub-
micron resolution of the strain tensor components are in very good agreement with ﬁnite
element simulations.
