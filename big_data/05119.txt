Abstract. The Snake-in-the-Box problem is that of ﬁnding a longest
induced path in an n-dimensional hypercube. We prove new lower bounds
for the values n ∈ {11, 12, 13}. The Coil-in-the-Box problem is that of
ﬁnding a longest induced cycle in an n-dimensional hypercube. We prove
new lower bounds for the values n ∈ {12, 13}.

Introduction

In 1958, Kautz [9] observed that the vertices of an induced path in a hypercube
can be used as code words in Gray codes detecting single-bit errors. Applications
of such codes date back to the 19th century, where they were used in telegra-
phy. They are nowadays used in many areas of mathematics, computer science
and engineering, such as error correction in digital communication, disk sector
encoding, clock domain crossing, computer network topologies and in the design
of genetic algorithms, just to name a few; we refer to Drapela [4] for background
information. The eﬀectiveness of a Gray code depends on its length. Hence, the
central research question is:

How can we ﬁnd a longest induced path in a hypercube?

Kautz coined the name “snake-in-the-box” for this problem. The snake-in-the-
box problem has been extensively studied in the literature, just as its variant
“coil-in-the-box”, where the goal is to determine a longest induced cycle instead
of a path. As we shall discuss, the lengths of a longest snake and a longest coil
are not known for any hypercube of dimension larger than 8. The problem of
ﬁnding a longest induced path is NP-hard even for bipartite graphs [6], but its
complexity for hypercubes is still unknown. As exhaustive search is too time
consuming, a variety of computational and mathematical techniques have been
used to ﬁnd lower bounds for these problems. See Drapela [4] for details on these
techniques.

In this note the main aim is to show three new lower bounds for snake-in-
the-box and two new lower bounds for coil-in-the-box. We do this in Section 3
after ﬁrst giving the required terminology in Section 2. Examples meeting our
lower bounds are presented in the Appendix. Our methods are based on the
stochastic beam search method, which is a general heuristic search method that
was recently used by Meyerson et al. [12,13] to improve lower bounds for both
snake-in-the-box and coil-in-the-box. We will explain our modiﬁcations to their
algorithm in full detail in a future paper.

2 Terminology

A graph H is an induced subgraph of another graph G if H can be obtained
from G by a sequence of vertex deletions. For r ≥ 1, the path Pr on r vertices
is the graph with vertices u1, . . . , ur and edges u1u2, . . . , ur−1ur. The cycle Cr
is the graph obtained from Pr by adding the edge uru1. We say that Pr and Cr
are of length r − 1 and r, respectively. For n ≥ 1, the n-dimensional hypercube
Qn is the graph that contains 2n vertices, each of which is represented by a
binary vector of length n, such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if their
binary vectors diﬀer by exactly one bit. A snake is an induced subgraph of Qn
that is a path, and a coil is an induced subgraph of Qn that is a cycle. The
Snake-in-the-Box problem is that of ﬁnding a longest snake in Qn for a given
integer n and the Coil-in-the-Box problem is that of ﬁnding a longest coil in
Qn for a given integer n. Both problems have also been investigated for other
graph classes (see, for example, [19]).

3 Known Results

Besides snakes and coils, a number of variants and generalizations, such as sym-
metric coils [2] (also known as doubled coils), k-snakes and k-coils [7,17], and
single-track circuit codes [8] have been studied. However, in this section we will
only focus on the original notions of snakes and coils and we restrict our overview
to exact or lower bounds for Snake-in-the-Box and Coil-in-the-Box for hy-
percubes of small dimensions, that is, we will consider n-dimensional hypercubes
for n ≤ 20. We refer to, for example, [5,18,21] for upper bounds for these two
problems.

For n ≤ 8, both Snake-in-the-Box and Coil-in-the-Box have been solved
exactly:

– For n ≤ 5, Kautz [9] determined a longest coil. Using exhaustive search,

Davies [3] found a longest snake for n ≤ 6 and a longest coil for n = 6.

– For n = 7, Potter, Robinson, Miller and Kochut [16] used a genetic algorithm
to ﬁnd a longest snake and Kochut [11] used exhaustive search to ﬁnd a
longest coil.

– For n = 8, ¨Osterg˚ard and Pettersson used canonical augmentation to ﬁnd a

longest snake [14] and a longest coil [15].

For n ≥ 9, only lower bounds for the length of a longest snake or coil are known.
These lower bounds have been improved over the years and the state of the art
results are as follows:

– For n = 9, Wynn [20] proved that the length of a longest snake and coil is

at least 190 and 188, respectively.

– For n = 10, Kinny [10] showed that a longest snake has length at least 370
and Meyerson et al. [12] showed that a longest coil has length at least 362.

2

– For 11 ≤ n ≤ 12, the results of Meyerson et al. [12] from 2015 are known to

give the best lower bounds for the lengths of a longest snake and coil.

– For n = 13, Meyerson et al. [12] showed that a longest snake has length
at least 2520 and Abbott and Katchalski [1] showed that a longest coil has
length at least 2468.

– For 14 ≤ n ≤ 20, the results of Abbott and Katchalski [1] from 1991 are still
unbeaten. The same authors also showed a general lower bound by showing
that for each n ≥ 21, a longest coil has length at least 77

256 2n.

We refer to Table 1 for an overview of the currently best lower bounds on the
length of a longest snake or coil for every n ≤ 20. We note that the Snake-
in-the-Box Records page http://ai1.ai.uga.edu/sib/sibwiki/ at the University of
Georgia maintains a list of records for the Snake-in-the-Box and Coil-in-the-Box
problems for every n ≤ 13.

4 Our Results

We prove that the length of a longest snake is at least 708 for n = 11, at
least 1357 for n = 12 and at least 2687 for n = 13 and that the length of a
longest coil is at least 1340 for n = 12 and at least 2584 for n = 13. See also
Table 1. We do this by giving examples of snakes and coils of these lengths in the
Appendix. We veriﬁed the correctness of our solutions using the veriﬁer provided

A The New Snakes and Coils

Recall that two vertices in a hypercube are adjacent if and only if they diﬀer
in exactly one bit. A path u1u2 · · · un in a hypercube Qn can be represented
by a transition sequence i1, . . . , in−1 where for j = 1, . . . , n − 1, ij denotes the
vector entry of the bit in which vertices uj−1 and uj diﬀer. Similarly, a cycle in
a hypercube can be represented by a transition sequence as well.
