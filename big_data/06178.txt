1. Introduction

For an irrational real number α and real number γ one deﬁnes the two-sided inho-

mogeneous approximation constant

(1.1)

M (α, γ) := lim inf

|n|→∞ |n|||nα − γ||.

Fixing α and varying γ gives an inhomogeneous spectrum for α

(1.2)

L(α) := {M (α, γ)

: γ ∈ R, γ 6∈ Z + αZ},

akin (awkward reciprocals aside) to the traditional Lagrange spectrum

(1.3)

L := {M (α, 0)−1 : α ∈ R}.

For a γ not of the form m + nα, n, m ∈ Z, we showed in [12] how to express M (α, γ) in
terms of a semi-regular continued fraction expansion of α

α = [a0; ε1a1, ε2a2, ε3a3, ....],

(1.4)

(1.5)

{γ} =

Xi=1

ciDi−1, Di := |qiα − pi|,

where pi/qi are the convergents arising from the truncations of the expansion of α. As
usual ||x|| and {x} denote the distance from x to the nearest integer and the fractional
part of x respectively. By working with ±α (mod 1) we can of course assume that

(1.6)

0 < α <

,

0 ≤ γ < 1.

We are interested here in the largest point of the spectrum (1.2),

(1.7)

ρ(α) := sup

M (α, γ),

γ6∈Z+αZ

BOUNDS ON THE INHOMOGENEOUS APPROXIMATION CONSTANT

and in particular how ρ(α) is aﬀected by the size of the partial quotients in the expansion

of α. From a well-known result of Minkowski

(1.8)

ρ(α) ≤

1
4

.

Grace [9] showed that this bound is achievable (see also Cassels [4, Thm IIB, p.48],

Rockett-Szusz [17] and related results of Barnes [2]). Equality though requires un-

bounded partial quotients and for badly approximable α Khinchin [10] obtained the

improvement

(1.9)

ρ(α) ≤

1

4p1 − 4M 2(α, 0),

with equality in (1.9) for the golden ratio or when α has period

(1.10)

εiai = +R, R even.

However while M (α, 0) is controlled primarily by the size of the limsup of the partial

quotients, ρ(α) depends more naturally on the liminf of the partial quotients. It will be

convenient here to use the nearest integer continued fraction expansion, rather than the

usual regular continued fraction expansion with all εi = +1. That is to say the partial

quotients ai are generated iteratively by taking the nearest integer in the continued frac-

tion algorithm, rather than always rounding down as in the regular continued fraction

(see (2.3)). When (1.4) is the nearest integer expansion and

(1.11)

R := lim inf
i→∞

ai,

Fukasawa [8,I,II] showed that

(1.12)

ρ(α) =

For ﬁnite R he gave a number of upper bounds. In particular

ρ(α) ≤

about the signs of the εi (see Fukasawa [8,IV]). Indeed if the nearest integer expansion
coincides with the negative continued fraction expansion (i.e. the εi = −1 for all i ≥ 2),
then

(1.15)

ρ(α) ≤

1

4(cid:18)1 −

1

for even as well as odd R (again best possible, see [14]). Notice that (1.12) would

not be true if we replaced the nearest integer by the regular or negative continued

fraction expansion (from the correspondence between the regular expansion and negative

expansion;

(1.16)
, −(a5 + 2), ...]

strings of ai = 2 in its negative expansion).

We are interested here in obtaining corresponding lower bounds for ρ(α) in terms of

R. We showed in [12] that when all but ﬁnitely many of the partial quotients of α are
even (with additional restrictions imposed on occurrences of εiai = −2) the value of
ρ(α) is achieved by taking

(1.17)

γ∗ = γ∗(α) :=

(ai − 1 + εi)Di−1.

Xi=1

If there are odd partial quotients we can no longer take the integer coeﬃcients ci to be
all 1
2 (ai − 1 + εi) but it seems reasonable to take ci to be the closest integer possible to

this. Hence if ani denotes the ith odd partial quotient we set

(1.18) γ∗ = γ∗(α) :=

(ai − 1 + εi + λi)Di−1, λi :=(cid:26) 0,

(−1)j,

if ai is even,
if ai = anj .

The value of M (α, γ∗) then gives us a lower bound on ρ(α):

Theorem 1 will follow from the more precise Theorem 4 bound given in Section 3.

Our result is asymptotically fairly precise (at least when R is even):

Notice that Theorem 1 gives the absolute lower bound ρ(α) ≥ 1/27.211... for all α
(this being the best bound producable from our choice γ∗). However if we use what we

shall call an adjusted nearest integer expansion rather than the nearest integer expansion

then we can improve this bound slightly.

Theorem 3. If (1.4) gives an ‘adjusted nearest integer expansion’ for α, as deﬁned in

Section 2 below, then the corresponding γ∗ deﬁned in (1.18) satisﬁes

(1.22)

M (α, γ∗) ≥

(31 − 2√10 − 3√13)

CHRISTOPHER G. PINNER

It will be clear from the proof that we can come arbitrarily close to this bound by

taking expansions of period

(1.23)

(3, )k − 2, 2, −3, (−4, −2, 2, 2, )k

with k suitably large (although presumably γ∗ does not give ρ(α)).

Bounds of the form,

(1.24)

ρ(α) ≥ C0

for all α in R, are certainly not new (see Davenport [5]). Davenport [6] gives C0 = 1

128 ,

Ennola [7] improving this to

(1.25)

C0 =

1

(16 + 6√6)

=

1

30.24...

(again best possible for his construction). The bound 1/32 is given in [17].

The smallest known value of ρ(α) (giving an upper bound on the largest C0 possible

in such a bound) still appears to be Pitman’s example [16]

This α has a nearest integer expansion of period

(1.27)

3, −3, −3, −3, −2, 3, −3, −2,

and an adjusted nearest integer expansion of period

(1.28)

−4, −2, 2, −4, −3, −2, 2, −3.

Davenport’s and Ennola’s bounds in fact arise from the closely related study of the

inhomogeneous minima of real indeﬁnite quadratic forms (the connection is explained

in Section 5).

2. Notation

We recall some notations from [12]. For an expansion of the form (1.4) we write αi

for the tail of the continued fraction

(2.1)

αi := [0; ai+1, εi+2ai+2, εi+3ai+3, . . . ],

and ¯αi for the reversed expansion,

(2.2)

¯αi := [0; ai, εiai−1, εi−1ai−2, . . . , ε2a1].

We shall primarily assume that (1.4) is the nearest integer continued fraction expansion,

generated using the algorithm

(a0, ε1, α0) := (0, 1, α),

(2.3)

i (cid:5) , 1,(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)α−1
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:1) ,
(ai+1, εi+2, αi+1) :=(cid:26) (cid:0)(cid:4)α−1
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:1) ,
i (cid:7) , −1,(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)α−1

For the nearest integer continued fraction the ‘backwards’ expansion will be a singular
continued fraction expansion (see Perron [13, §40]) and we plainly have

(2.4)

αi < 1/2,

¯αi ≤ [0; 2, −3] =

Writing pi/qi for the convergents

(2.5)

we deﬁne

(2.6)

pi
qi

:= [a0; ε1a1, ε2a2, ..., εiai],

δi := −(−ε1)(−ε2) · · · (−εi+1), Di := δi(qiα − pi),

and recall the relations

(2.7)

Di = α0α1 · · · αi,

qi = ( ¯α1 · · · ¯αi)−1.

8

CHRISTOPHER G. PINNER

When R = 2 there is an inherent asymmetry between the ‘forwards’ and ‘backwards’
expansions αi and ¯αi in that we can have εi = −1, ai = 2 but not ai = 2, εi+1 = −1.
Thus there is some merit in using an adjusted nearest integer expansion satisfying

(i) ai ≥ 2 with ai = 2 ⇒ εi or εi+1 = 1.
(ii) If ai = 2, εi = −1 then 1/ ¯αi−1 − 1/αi ≥ 1.
(iii) If ai = 2, εi+1 = −1 then 1/αi − 1/ ¯αi−1 > 1.
(iv) The expansion contains no block · · · , 2, −2, · · · or · · · , 2, (−3, )k − 2, · · · .

For these expansions we certainly have

(2.8)

αi, ¯αi ≤ [0; 2, −3] =

√5 − 1

2

.

Such an expansion can be obtained from the nearest integer continued fraction (and

vice versa) by use of the relation

(2.9)

[...., εa, −2, b, ...] = [..., ε(a − 1), 2, −(b + 1), ...]

to replace any combinations ai = 2, εi = −1 not satisfying (ii) by ai = 2, εi+1 = −1
satisfying (iii), applying

(2.10)

[..., −3, −3, −2, b, ...] = [..., −3, −2, 2, −(b + 1), ...] = [..., −2, 2, −3, −(b + 1), ...]

as necessary to deal with any additional ai = 2, εi = −1 not satisfying (ii) introduced
by this process by the presence of a preceding −3. Blocks disallowed in (iv) will plainly
not be introduced by this process.

For a real γ in [0, 1] and expansion (1.4) we form the alpha expansion

(2.11)

by setting γ0 := γ and

(2.12)

γ =

∞

Xi=1

ciDi−1

ci+1 :=(cid:22) γi

αi(cid:23) , γi+1 :=(cid:26) γi

Writing

(2.13)

bi :=(cid:26) ai,

ai − 1,

if εi+1 = 1,
if εi+1 = −1,

this gives the unique expansion of the form (2.11) with coeﬃcients satisfying

(i) 0 ≤ ci ≤ bi,
(ii) If (ci, εi+1) = (ai, +1) then ci+1 = 0
(iii) If (ci, εi+1) = (ai − 1, −1) with (cj, εj+1) = (aj − 2, −1) for any i < j < t then

ct ≤ bt − 1. If in addition (ct, εt+1) = (at − 1, +1) then ct+1 = 0.

(iv) The tail of the sequence does not consist solely of blocks of the form

(a) (ci, εi+1) = (ai, +1), (ci+1, εi+1) = (0, ±1),
(b) (ci, εi+1) = (ai − 1, −1),
(cj, εj+1) = (aj − 2, −1),
(c) (ci, εi+1) = (ai − 1, −1), (ct, εt+1) = (at − 1, +1),

(cj, εj+1) = (aj − 2, −1) for any i < j < t.

for all j > i,
(ct+1, εt+2) = (0, ±1), with

We also gave the upper bound:

There is presumably a connection between Lemma 1 and the divided cell algorithm

approach of Barnes [2].

3. Refined bounds

For an expansion (1.4) with R = lim inf ai we deﬁne

R∗ :=(cid:26) R,

R + 1,

if R is odd,
if R is even,

R∗∗ :=(cid:26) R,

R + 1,

if R is even,
if R is odd,

(3.1)

and

(3.2)

θ1 :=

1
2

(pR2

∗ + 4 − R∗),

θ2 :=( 1

2 (R∗∗ −pR2

1
2 ,

∗∗ − 4),

if R ≥ 3,
if R = 2.

The lower bound (1.19) will follow from the precise bound:

BOUNDS ON THE INHOMOGENEOUS APPROXIMATION CONSTANT

11

Theorem 4. If (1.4) gives the nearest integer expansion for α, then the corresponding

γ∗ deﬁned in (1.18) satisﬁes

(3.3)

M (α, γ∗) ≥ M1 :=

1

4(cid:16)1 − 2

R∗−θ2(cid:17)(cid:16)1 −

1

max{4,R∗∗}(cid:16)1 + θ2
R∗−θ2(cid:17)

max{4,R∗∗}(cid:16)θ1 − 1

1−θ1(cid:17)(cid:17)

1

.

This bound is best possible in the sense that periodic α with period

(3.4)

(R∗, )kR∗∗, −R∗, (−R∗∗, )k
(3, )k4, −3, −2, A,

if R ≥ 3,
if R = 2,

will have M (α, γ∗) → M1 as k (and A) → ∞.

We should note that γ∗ will not give ρ(α) for the examples (3.4). If εi = 1 for almost

all i (i.e. the expansion agrees with the regular expansion from some point onwards)

then the lower bound (1.19) readily improves to

(3.5)

M (α, γ∗) ≥

1

4(cid:18)1 −

2
R

+ O(

1

R2 )(cid:19) .

In this case it proves easier to remove the sign alternation and consider

(3.6)

γ∗∗ :=

1
2

∞

Xi=1

(ai + λ′

i), λ′

i :=(cid:26) 0,

1,

if ai is even,
if ai is odd.

This gives the optimal γ when α has period +R∗ (as does γ∗) and in a number of period

two cases (see [11])

Theorem 5.

If (1.4) gives the regular continued fraction expansion of α with R ≥ 2, then with R∗

and θ1 as in (3.1) and (3.2) above

In particular when the regular continued fraction expansion does not have inﬁnitely

many ones we obtain

(3.8)

ρ(α) ≥ M (α, γ∗∗) ≥

.

Bound (3.7) is sharp, achieved by taking an α with inﬁnitely many blocks A, (R∗, )k
with A and k → ∞, although γ∗∗ will not give ρ(α) in such cases. Asymptotically
though (3.7) is a good lower bound for ρ(α):

M (α, γ∗) ≥

(R − 2θ)

R3(cid:19) , R ≥ 4.

This immediately gives us a simple bound on the extent to which the integer coeﬃcients

ci in the alpha-expansion of optimal (in the sense of achieving ρ(α)) or near optimal γ
can deviate from 1

2 (ai − 1 + εi) :

The restriction R ≥ 4 is actually needed here; for example a period two alpha with
ε2ka2k = −3, ε2k+1a2k+1 = −4 for all but ﬁnitely many k has ρ(α) achieved for γ with
c2k = 2 and c2k+1 = 0 for all but ﬁnitely many k. All possibilities in (3.15) and (3.17)

can occur (see examples in [15] and [11]).

4. Proofs

Proof of Theorem 1

We show how Theorem 1 can be deduced from the lower bound M1 of Theorem 4
(proved below). We assume R ≥ 4 (evaluating M1 gives the bound for R = 2 or 3).

Proof of Theorem 2

We suppose that α has expansion of period −R∗∗, R∗∗, −R∗, R∗ and that γ achieves
ρ(α). From Theorem 7 (proved below) we can assume that tk = 0, ±2 if ak = R∗∗ and
tk = ±1, ±3 if ak = R∗. Moreover we can eliminate tk = ±3 since if tk = ±3 inﬁnitely
often (2.17) gives

Now if (tk, tk+1) = (2, 2) then

If (tk, tk+1) = (2, −2) then s2(k) gives the same result. Observing that once we have
eliminated a block of ti from consideration the same is true for its negative (since

changing the signs of the ti merely interchanges s1(i) with s3(i) and s2(i) with s4(i))
we can assume that (ak, ak+1) = (R∗∗, R∗∗) implies that ±(tk, tk+1) = (0, 0), (2, 0) or
(0, 2). Now if (tk, tk+1) = (0, 2) then

with s3(k + 3) giving the same bound if ~t = (0, 0, −1, 1, 0, 0). Since ±~t must be of one
of these forms we gain the upper bound (1.21) for ρ(α). For R even the lower bound

(1.19) shows that M (α, γ∗) achieves this, while for R odd it is readily checked that the
period four expansion 0, −2, 1, 1 for the ti achieves the upper bound (1.21). (cid:4)

Proofs of The Lower Bounds in Theorems 3, 4 & 5

We suppose that we are working with the nearest integer expansion or an adjusted
nearest integer expansion as appropriate. We assume that R = lim inf ai ≥ 2 is ﬁnite
with ai ≥ R for all i (from Theorem 1 of [11] changing a ﬁnite number of partial
quotients ai or coeﬃcients ci has no eﬀect on the value of M (α, γ)). We assume that

γ∗ has the expansion (1.18), and when the nearest integer expansion is also a regular

expansion that γ∗∗ has expansion (3.6). From Lemmas 3 and 13 below these expansions

satisfy the requirements of Lemma 1 and hence for Theorems 3, 4 and 5 it will be enough

to check that the functions s1(i), ..., s4(i) deﬁned in (2.17) are greater than the required

bounds.

With R∗, R∗∗, θ, θ1 and θ2 as in (3.1), (3.2) and (3.11) above we deﬁne the parameters

R1 := R∗ − θ, R2 := max{2, R∗∗ − θ},
R3 := R∗ − θ2, R4 := max{4, R∗∗} − θ, R5 := R∗∗ − θ,

(4.1)

so that for a nearest integer expansion

if ai+1 is odd,
if ai+1 is even,

¯αi ≤(cid:26) 1/R1,

1/R5,

if ai is odd,
if ai is even,

16

with R4 replacing R5 when ai ≥ 4.

We give the following bounds on d+

i and d−

i

for γ∗:

Lemma 3. If (1.4) is a nearest integer or adjusted nearest integer expansion then

expansion (1.18) gives the valid alpha-expansion for γ∗, with all i in S(γ∗) (see (2.16)).

If (1.4) is a nearest integer expansion then for γ∗ the d+

i , d−

i of (2.15) satisfy

i | ≤ min(cid:26)αi,
|d+

1

R1(cid:27) ,

|d−
i | ≤

min{θ1, ¯αi}.

If (1.4) is an adjusted nearest integer expansion with R = 2 then γ∗ has

¯αi(cid:27) .

i | ≤ min(cid:26) 1
|d−

i | ≤ min(cid:26)αi,
|d+
Proof: Clearly ci = 1
2 (ai − 1 + εi + λi) has 0 ≤ ci < ai with ci = ai − 1 implying εi = 1.
Moreover ci = ai − 1 or (ci, εi) = (ai − 2, −1) can only occur when ai = 2 or ai = 3
and λi = 1. The sign alternation in the λi thus prevents (ci, εi+1) = (ai − 1, −1) being
followed by (cj, εj+1) = (aj − 2, −1) for both j = i + 1 and i + 2. Hence (1.18) gives a
valid expansion.

Next we bound d+

i . If ai+j is even for all j ≥ 1 then plainly d+

i = 0, so assume that
ai+J is odd for some J ≥ 1 with ai+j even for any 1 ≤ j < J. Then the alternation in
the sign of the λi gives

i | =
|d+

 Y1≤j<J

αi+j−1
i+J−1| ≤ Y1≤i≤J
|d+

and the bound follows from (4.2).

αi+j−1 ≤ min{αi, αi+J−1}

We assume ﬁrst that we are using the nearest integer expansion and show by induction

that γ∗ satisﬁes |d−

i | ≤ θ1/(1 − θ1), the bound

(4.3)

i−1|(cid:1)
i | ≤ ¯αi(cid:0)1 + |d−
|d−

then immediately giving |d−
1/a1 ≤ 1/R∗ as a1 is even or odd. If ai is even we have |d−

i | ≤ ¯αi/(1 − θ1). For i = 1 we plainly have |d−
i−1| < |d−

i | = ¯αi|d−

1 | = 0 or
i−1| so we

assume that ai is odd. If ai > R∗ or ai = R∗, εi = 1, ¯αi−1 ≥ θ1 we have ¯αi ≤ θ1 and
(4.3) gives

|d−
i | ≤ θ1 (1 + θ1/(1 − θ1)) .

If ai = R∗, εi = 1, and ¯αi−1 ≤ θ1 then ¯αi = 1/(R∗ + ¯αi−1) and (4.3) gives

|d−
i | ≤ ¯αi (1 + ¯αi−1/(1 − θ1)) < θ1/(1 − θ1).

If ai = R∗, εi = −1 and ai−1 is odd then the alternation in the sign of the λi gives

|d−
i | ≤ ¯αi < θ1/(1 − θ1),

since plainly ¯αi−1 < 1 − θ1. If ai = R∗, εi = −1 and ai−1 is even then

i | ≤ ¯αi(cid:0)1 + ¯αi−1|d−
|d−

i−2|(cid:1) ≤ (1 + ¯αi−1θ1/(1 − θ1)) /(R∗ − ¯αi−1) < θ1/(1 − θ1),

since ai−1 ≥ 4 certainly ensures that ¯αi−1 < 1
2 (1− θ1). For the adjusted nearest integer
expansion with R = 2 we only bother to obtain the less precise bound |d−
i | < 1/2. The
proof is almost identical, noting that if ai is odd with ai ≥ 5 or ai = 3 and εi = 1 then
(4.3) gives

3(cid:18)1 +
2(cid:19) ,

Lemmas for Theorem 3

We suppose that (1.4) gives an adjusted nearest integer expansion for α as deﬁned
in Section 2. We assume that R = 2 (when R ≥ 3 the result follows from Theorem 1).
As remarked above we need only show that the s1(i), ..., s4(i) of (2.17) are all at least

1/25.159.... We break this proof down into a number of lemmas.

for any 0 ≤ j < J. So

i+4J| = αi+4J αi+4J+1αi+4J+2(1 − |d+

since (1 − θ0 ¯αi) > (1 − ¯αi) and αi+4J < 2/5 gives (αi+4J − θ0) < 3
5 αi+4J . So we
can assume that ai+4J+1 = 4, εi+4J+2 = −1 and (since αi+4J > θ0 implies ai+4J+2 +
3 (4 + √10)) also ai+4J+2 = 2, εi+4j+3 = 1. Now since (4 − ¯αi+4J ) −
εi+4J+3αi+4J+2 < 1
(ai+4J+3 + εi+4J+4αi+4J+3) ≥ 1 we must have ai+4J+3 = 2 or 3 (with εi+4J+4 = −1
if ai+4J+3 = 3). If ai+4J+3 = 3 then |d+
i+4J+3|) =
αi+4J (1 − |d+
i+4J+3|)/(7 − 2αi+4J+3) and we can take κ = 3/35, giving w > 0 since
αi+4J = (7 − 2αi+4J+3)/(25 − 7αi+4J+3) < 7/25 plainly gives (αi+4J − θ0) < 3
35 αi+4J .
So we assume that ai+4J+3 = 2 and the condition αi+4J > θ0 gives εi+4J+4αi+4J+3 >
2 (√10 − 2) forcing εi+4J+4 = 1, ai+4J+4 = 2 and εi+4J+5 = −1. Thus the smallest

So we are left only to deal with εiai = −3, εi−1ai−1 = 2.

Proof of the Theorem 3

From Lemma 6 we have s2(i), s4(i) > 1/25.148 except when εi+1ai+1 = 2 in which

case s2(i), s4(i) = s1(i + 1), s3(i + 1).

Hence it is enough to check the s1(i), s3(i). If εiai = −2 then s1(i), s3(i) = s1(i −
1), s3(i − 1) with ai−1 6= 2 so we can assume that ¯αi ≤ 1
2 . Now if εi+1ai+1 = −3 with
i < 0 then s1(i), s3(i) = s1(i + 1), s3(i + 1) with ±d+
±d+
i+1 > 0 and ¯αi+1 < 1

7 and 8 immediately give the required lower bound in the remaining cases. (cid:4)

Lemmas for Theorem 4

For Theorem 4 we assume that (1.4) gives the nearest integer expansion for α. We

again break the proof down into manageable lemmas:

Lemma 9. Suppose that (1.4) gives the nearest integer expansion of α. If E0 ≥ F0 ≥ θ2
then γ∗ satisﬁes

with equality iﬀ εi+j+2ai+j+1 = −R∗∗ for all j ≥ 1.
Proof. Suppose that for some J ≥ 0 we have (ai+j+1, εi+j+2) = (R∗∗, −1) for any
1 ≤ j ≤ J. Then

Now if aJ+i+2 > R∗∗ or ai+J+2 = R∗∗ and εi+J+3 = 1 then αi+J+1 < θ2 and κ = 0
gives w > 0 in all three cases. If aJ+i+2 = R∗ then |d+

and w > 0 since E0 − F0 < E0 − θ2 and (αi+J+1 − θ2) < 1

If εi+1 = −1 and ai+1 is even then

If εi+1 = −1 and ai+1 is odd then

B1 =

i+1|

1 − ¯αiαi

and when R is even or εi+2 = 1 or ai+1 > R∗ the bound B1 ≥ S1 follows from αi ≤ 1/R3.
So we can assume that ai+1 = R∗ = R, εi+2 = −1 and by Lemma 9

if εi+1 = −1 and R is even or ai+1 > R∗∗ or ai+1 = R∗∗ and εi+2 = 1. For εi+1 = −1,
R = R∗ and ai+1 odd we have

Proof of Theorem 6

Suppose that α has period R∗∗, R∗, R∗, R∗, R∗, and that γ achieves ρ(α). From
Theorem 7 we can assume that tk = ±1 if ak = R∗ and tk = 0, ±2 if ak = R∗∗. We
ﬁrst rule out tk = ±2 (this is immediate from (3.16) if R is even as observed in (3.17)).
Suppose that ak = R∗∗ and tk = 2. If tk+1 = 1 then

Similarly tk = −2 is dealt with using s1(k) and s4(k). So we assume that tk = 0 if
ak = R∗∗. Suppose that ak = R∗∗ and set ~t = (tk, tk+1, ..., tk+5). If ~t = (0, 1, 1, 1, ∗, 0)

Similarly for ~t = (0, ∗, −1, 1, 1, 0) using s3(k + 3). We can also immediately dispose of
−~t of these forms (by observing that changing the signs of the tk merely interchanging
the roles of s1 and s3, and s2 and s4). Since this includes all possible choices of ~t we

can do no better than (3.10), this being achievable with γ∗∗. (cid:4)

Proof of Theorem 7

Suppose that R ≥ 4 and that γ has

M (α, γ) >

Noting that

R − 3

we can assume from (2.19) that i is in S(γ) for almost all i. Hence from (2.18) we have

bound follows similarly. (cid:4)

5. Lower bound problems for quadratic forms

For a real indeﬁnite form

(6.1)

with

(6.2)

f (x, y) = ax2 + bxy + cy2 = a(x − αy)(x − ¯αy) ∈ R[x, y],

D(f ) := b2 − 4ac > 0,

and a point P = (r, s) in R2 \ Z2 one deﬁnes

M (f, P ) := inf

(x,y)∈Z2 |f (x + r, y + s)|,

(6.3)

M ∗(f, P ) :=

lim inf
(x,y)∈Z2

|f (x + r, y + s)|.

max{|x|,|y|}→∞

The inhomogeneous minima is then

(6.4)

M (f ) := sup

M (f, P ).

P

It is straightforward to see that

(6.5) M ∗(f, P ) =pD(f ) min{M (α, γP ), M ( ¯α, ¯γP )}, γP = r − sα, ¯γP = r − s ¯α.
Hence, deﬁning a related constant M ∗(f ) ≥ M (f ) by
(6.6)

M ∗(f, P ),

M ∗(f ) := sup
P

a bound of the form

(6.7)

(6.8)

M ∗(f ) ≥ C0pD(f )

M (f ) ≥ C0pD(f )

for all forms f , is equivalent to (1.24). Bound (6.7) certainly follows from the bound

actually proved by Davenport and Ennola. We should note that in the case of historical

interest the f are irreducible forms in Z[x, y] and one has M (f )/pD(f ) = ρ(α). Bounds

of the form (6.8) originally rose out of the study of norm-Euclidean real quadratic ﬁelds

(see Barnes [1] for details).
