ABSTRACT

X-rays are a powerful probe of activity in early stages of star formation. They allow us to identify
young stars even after they have lost the IR signatures of circumstellar disks and provide constraints on
their distance. Here we report on XMM-Newton observations which detect 121 young stellar objects
(YSOs) in two ﬁelds between L1641S and κ Ori. These observations extend the Survey of Orion A with
XMM and Spitzer (SOXS). The YSOs are contained in a ring of gas and dust apparent at millimeter
wavelengths, and in far-IR and near-IR surveys. The X-ray luminosity function of the young stellar
objects detected in the two ﬁelds indicates a distance of 250 − 280 pc, much closer than the Orion A
cloud and similar to distance estimates of κ Ori. We propose that the ring is a 5− 8 pc diameter shell
that has been swept up by κ Ori. This ring contains several groups of stars detected by Spitzer and
WISE including one surrounding the Herbig Ae/Be stars V1818 Ori. In this interpretation, the κ Ori
ring is one of several shells swept up by massive stars within the Orion Eridanus Superbubble, and is
unrelated to the southern portion of Orion A / L1641 S.

INTRODUCTION

Orion OB1 is the nearest example of an actively form-
ing OB association. It contains 71 O to B3 stars, two
massive molecular clouds, and over 5000 young low mass
stars. At a distance of 400-450 pc, Orion OB1 is embed-
ded within the Orion-Eridanus superbubble, generated
by the massive star winds and supernovae (Brown et al.
1995; Bally 2008).

The southern portion of the association includes the
Orion A molecular cloud with the massive star form-
ing Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC, age ∼ 2 Myr) and the
ﬁlamentary dark cloud complex L1641. The Orion A
cloud has an almost cometary shape; this morphology
may arise from its interaction with the older subgroups
in the OB1 association. Unlike the ONC, the L1641 re-
gion is comprised of primarily low mass stars in small
clusters, groups and isolation (Carpenter 2000; Allen &
Davis 2008; Hsu et al. 2012; Megeath et al. 2016). The
southern end of the Orion A cloud (directly south of
L1641 and also known as L1647 and L1648) appears to
bifurcate and form a ring-like structure (Lombardi et al.
2011).

The Survey of Orion A with X-ray and Spitzer (SOXS)
used new and archival XMM-Newton observations to
study the Orion A cloud down to a declination of
−8.5 deg (Pillitteri et al. 2013). These observations com-
plemented existing optical and infrared (IR) observations
obtained with Spitzer and ground facilities (F˝ur´esz et al.
2008, Megeath et al. 2012, Hsu et al. 2012, Alves & Bouy
2012, Fang et al. 2013). SOXS pinpointed the population
of disk-less Pre Main Sequence stars bright in X-rays and
elusive in infrared studies. This population constitutes a
signiﬁcant fraction of the stellar content in L1641 cloud.
The X-ray data also detected a cluster of pre-main se-
quence stars surrounding ι Ori which were older (given

brighter X-ray luminosities) than the ONC. This X-ray
cluster appears to be the same as the foreground cluster
identiﬁed by Alves & Bouy (2012) using optical obser-
vations, and may represent the oldest stellar population
associated with Orion A (see Da Rio et al. 2016).

We have focused our attention to the southern end
of L1641 ﬁlament near the star κ Ori (a.k.a. Saiph).
This star is a blue supergiant B0.5 Ia with a tempera-
ture of about 26,500 K, a luminosity ∼ 105 L(cid:12) and strong
winds with a mass loss rate of about 9 × 10−7M(cid:12) yr−1
(Crowther et al. 2006). Based on PARSEC isochrones
(Bressan et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2014; Tang et al. 2014;
Chen et al. 2015), the bolometric luminosity and Teﬀ of κ
Ori, we estimate an age of 6.5− 7 Myr. The parallax de-
termined by Hipparcos was 5.04 ±0.22 mas (van Leeuwen
2007), this is a little under 200±10 pc, signiﬁcantly closer
than the ONC. On the basis of Ca II absorption, Megier
et al. (2009) report a distance of 240 ± 40 pc, still signif-
icantly closer than Orion A.

In this paper we present evidence that κ Ori is the
center of a star forming ring signiﬁcantly closer than
Orion A. Due to superposition, this ring is often conﬂated
with Orion A or even with Mon R2. The evidence, which
will be discussed in detail below, includes: the Hippar-
cos distance to κ Ori, a ring of stars with disks visible in
mid-IR data, a similar ring visible in velocity maps from
CO surveys, and the X-ray luminosity of the YSOs in the
ring from which we infer their distances to be similar to

2

that of κ Ori.

The structure of the paper is the following: in Sect. 2
we describe new XMM-Newton observations and the data
analysis, in Sect. 3 we presents our results, in Sect. 4 we
discuss them and summarize our conclusions in Sect. 5.

2. X-RAY OBSERVATIONS

The XMM-Newton observations of two ﬁelds, North
(Field N = KN) and South (Field S = KS), were ob-
tained in March 10 and March 15 2015 using EPIC as
the primary instrument. Table 1 shows the details of the
exposures, each one of duration about 50 ks, and taken
with the Medium ﬁlter.

We used SAS ver. 14.0 to reduce the Observation Data
Files (ODFs) and to obtain calibrated lists of events for
MOS and pn instruments. We ﬁltered the events in
0.3 − 8.0 keV energy band, and used only events with
FLAG = 0 and PATTERN < 12 as prescribed by the
SAS manual. With SAS we obtained exposure maps in
0.3−8.0 keV and performed source detection with a code
based on wavelet convolution that operates simultane-
ously on MOS and pn data (Damiani et al. 1997b,a). We
used a threshold of signiﬁcance of 4.5 σ of the local back-
ground to discriminate real sources from spurious back-
ground ﬂuctuations. However, we added few sources to
the ﬁnal list with signiﬁcance in 4.0 < σ < 4.5 for the
cases of positional match with objects in SIMBAD or
PPMX catalogs. The ﬁnal list was also checked for spuri-
ous sources that could appear at the border of the CCDs.
We detected 238 X-rays sources with signiﬁcance > 4σ of
local background; 104 sources are in KN and 134 in KS
(Table 2). Among the output, the wavelet code returns
the count rate scaled by a reference instrument. In Ta-
ble 2 the count rates are referred to MOS and they have
been used to derive ﬂuxes using PIMMS software and
adopting a WABS+APEC model. For 36 sources with more
than 500 total counts we performed a best ﬁt modeling
to X-ray spectra with XSPEC software. For faint sources
we used median energies of count events and NH values
from a distance weighted average of NH of bright sources
as inputs for PIMMS. X-ray luminosities in the 0.3− 8.0
keV band were calculated assuming ﬁrst a distance of
400 pc. We calculated upper limits to count rates using
the same detection code for the 61 objects with IR ex-
cess from the catalog of Megeath et al. (2012) and not
detected in X-rays.

3. RESULTS

3.1. IR counterparts

We cross-correlated the positions of X-ray sources with
the coordinates of the IR catalog of Megeath et al. (2012).
The IR catalog is the result of a survey of Orion with
Spitzer that produced a classiﬁcation of protostars and
stars with disks. Of the 238 X-ray sources, 191 are iden-
tiﬁed within 8(cid:48)(cid:48) of one of 206 IR objects, 99 sources in
KS, 92 sources in KN. Some X-ray sources were multi-
ple matches within 8(cid:48)(cid:48) of IR objects. For these cases we
assigned the most likely counterparts based on IR pho-
tometry and visual inspection of X-rays and IR images.
However, nine X-ray sources are left associated with two
or three IR objects .

Among the IR matches, we ﬁnd 15 stars with disks in
KN and 35 in KS with X-ray detection. One protostar
in KN and 3 in KS are detected in X-rays. We used

Pillitteri et al.

X-ray detection of sources without IR excess as criteria
to identify disk-less stars (hereafter Class III stars). We
classiﬁed as Class III stars those IR objects with X-ray
detections, with [4.5]− [8.0] < 0.3 mag and brighter than
[4.5] < 14 mag. At the distance of ONC (400 pc), the
[4.5] ∼ 14 threshold at age of 4 − 5 Myr roughly identi-
ﬁes M 3 − M 4 spectral types and masses around 0.3M(cid:12)
(Siess et al. 2000). With this selection scheme we have
identiﬁed 48 objects in KN and 19 in KS as Class III
candidates.

The ratio of the stars with disks and without disks
is a probe of the evolutionary stage of the stars in the
parent cloud and eventually of their ages (Haisch et al.
2001; Hern´andez et al. 2008). The fraction of disks/total
objects (among X-ray detections) is ∼ 15/(15 + 48) =
15/63 ∼ (24± 7)% in KN and ∼ 35/(19 + 35) = 35/54 ∼
(65± 14)% in KS. This is indicative of a possible age dif-
ference between the two groups, with YSOs in KS being
2 − 3 Myr old and those in KN about 4 − 5 Myr old.
The presence of 14 protostars and small dense groups of
stars in KS are further indication of its youth (Megeath
et al. 2012). In comparison, L1641 shows an average ra-
tio of disk/total objects of (37 ± 6)%, although the disk
fraction varies through the clouds (Megeath et al. 2012;
Pillitteri et al. 2013).

3.2. X-ray luminosity

The sensitivity of XMM-Newton exposures is about
2.5× 10−15 erg s−1 cm−2 on axis, which corresponds to a
luminosity of 4.8×1028 erg s−1 for objects at the distance
of 400 pc; X-ray luminosities of the YSOs from Megeath’s
catalog were calculated assuming this distance. We stud-
ied how the X-ray detection rate of stars with disk vary
in diﬀerent strata of H band magnitudes. We estimate
completeness of > 95% at LX ≥ 3 × 1029 erg s−1 and
approximately H = 12 mag, which covers spectral types
down to late K in 2 − 5 Myr old YSOs. Below H = 13
mag the detection rate rapidly falls below 50%. Sensitiv-
ity and completeness of the XMM-Newton exposures in
KS and KN are similar to that of SOXS survey in L1641.
To compare to L1641, we used only the empirical cumu-
lative distribution of X-ray luminosities for both Class
III and stars with disks, these curves are shown in Fig.
1. The median of the curves of stars with disks and Class
III stars in KS and KN are very similar (log LX = 29.85
and log LX = 29.80, respectively), this is expected for
very young stars.

The idea of using the XLFs to diﬀerentiate distance is
owed to Feigelson et al. (2005). They observed that the
XLFs of the ONC, IC 348, and NGC 1333 appear simi-
lar and put forward the concept of an “universal” XLF.
Wang (2007) and Wang et al. (2008) found that a similar
XLF can be also applied to NGC 6357 and NGC 2244.
For ONC the XLF is well ﬁtted by a log-normal function
with median log LX = 29.3 erg s−1, and width σ ∼ 1.0
(Feigelson et al. 2005). Over the lifetime of a cluster,
the concept of a global XLF is clearly wrong since the
XLF evolves in time and diﬀerent stars evolve at diﬀer-
ent rates. However, for the youngest clusters diﬀerential
evolutionary eﬀects appear minimized as long as LX is
in saturated regime (t ≤ 20 − 30 Myr). Therefore, when
comparing XLFs of YSOs from κ Ori and L1641, we ex-
pect to ﬁnd similar X-ray emission levels given the simi-
lar sensitivity of XMM-Newton observations. The XLFs

√

of KS and KN indicate a signiﬁcant systematic over-
luminosity of both stars with disks (Class II) and without
disks (Class III) when compared to the analog curves of
L1641, this diﬀerence is of order of about 0.3 − 0.4 dex
in the median of the distributions. This diﬀerence of
luminosity can be explained with a wrong distance as-
sumed for the objects in KN and KS. We used 400 pc for
the YSOs near κ Ori, i.e., same distance of L1641, but
to match the medians of the distributions, the distance
must be reduced by a factor ∼
10(0.3−0.4) ∼ 1.4 − 1.6,
or dcorrected ∼ 250 − 280 pc. This distance is consistent
with the distance to κ Ori estimated from the Hipparcos
parallax and from Ca II absorption (240± 40 pc, Megier
et al. 2009), and suggests that the YSOs in these two
XMM-Newton ﬁelds could be at the same distance of κ
Ori, and signiﬁcantly closer than Orion A. For a distance
250 pc, our XMM-Newton exposures have a luminosity
limit of LX ∼ 2.2×1028 erg s−1; previous ROSAT RASS
survey had a typical ﬂux limit of 2× 10−13 erg s−1 cm−2,
which corresponds to 1.5 × 1030 erg s−1. This limit is
high enough that RASS should have missed the totality
of YSOs in KN and KS ﬁelds. At 250 pc we estimate
XMM-Newton to be sensitive to objects of spectral types
as late as M5.

4. A SHELL OF STARS ASSOCIATED WITH κ Ori.

The YSOs found by XMM-Newton are coincident in a
structure of dust and gas shaped like a bubble in mid-IR
(Fig. 2), and apparent as a ring in near-IR extinction
maps (Lombardi et al. 2011), in far-IR dust emission
maps (Lombardi et al. 2014), and CO maps (see Fig.
5a in Wilson et al. 2005. We propose that this ring is
tracing a partial, inhomogeneous shell centered on κ Ori.
The entire shell shows strong mid-IR emission in WISE
12µm, suggesting that the inner surfaces of the shell are
heated by κ Ori. Although the 12µm emission is more

uniform than at longer wave-lengths, structures apparent
in Planck and CO images are also visible at 12µm, bol-
stering conﬁdence that cold dust and gas structures are
related. At the distance of κ Ori (∼250 pc), the radius of
the bubble is ∼ 8 pc. The heated walls of a small cavity
is also visible in the WISE 12µm data toward KN, and
due to an F0 star within the dust ring. Another similar
cavity is visible in L1641 S, this other one is likely part
of Orion A.
Fig. 3 shows a map of the position of WISE objects
in a box 2 × 2 sq. deg around κ Ori. Objects within 1.2
deg from κ Ori and in the ring 1.2 − 2 deg from κ Ori
are marked with green and red colors, respectively. Blue
and cyan objects are the control samples and the catalog
of Megeath et al. (2012), respectively. Central panel of
Fig. 3 shows a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of the
same objects using w1 and w3 WISE band. A signiﬁcant
fraction of objects in the ring show excess in w1 − w3
color. These stars show similar colors and magnitudes of
the stars with disks of the Megeath’s catalog. The region
of objects with IR excesses is marked with the yellow
area in the CMD. The density of IR-excess sources in the
control ﬁeld is similar to that in the green region, hence
we ﬁnd no clear evidence of IR-excess sources inside the
ring. Across the ring the surface density of IR-excess
objects is four times larger than that found within 1.2
deg from κ Ori, indicating a population of young stars
embedded in the ring.

4.1. V1818 Ori

The V1818 Oris clump sits on the same ring but east-
ward of κ Ori, on the opposite side with respect to
KN/KS ﬁelds (see Fig. 2). V1818 Ori is a Herbig Be ob-
ject of spectral type B7. Chiang et al. (2015) has studied
V1818 Ori and its spectrum, and identiﬁed two dozens
of nearby YSOs that appear to form a small group to-

gether with the Herbig Be star. They have associated
V1818 Ori and the nearby YSOs to the Mon R2 complex
at ∼ 900 pc based on the similarity of radial velocity
of V1818 Ori with the velocities of the CO map of the
poorly studied nebula of NGC 2149 and to Mon R2 asso-
ciation. The value of extinction in near-IR bands and the
J band magnitude of V1818 Ori are fully consistent with
an object of spectral type B7 V star at 250 pc. Were
it at 900 pc as hypothesized by Chiang et al. (2015),
V1818 Ori should have the luminosity of a more evolved
B7 III star suﬀering of a much higher extinction.

Given the location of this group of YSOs on the dust
ring, we speculate that they are part of the same κ Ori
cluster at 250 − 280 pc. The velocity of V1818 Ori is
similar to velocity components of the ring observed in the
CO map of Wilson et al. (2005) adding further evidence
of its association to κ Ori.

4.2. The κ Ori star forming shell.

We propose that the YSOs in KN and KS ﬁelds and in
the V1818 Ori region are associated with a broken shell
of dense gas surrounding κ Ori. Furthermore, we present
evidence that this shell, although it overlaps the L1641
cloud in projection, is closer than the Orion A at a dis-
tance of 250 − 280 pc. The shell is detected in near-IR
extinction, far-IR dust continuum and CO maps indicat-
ing that it has molecular gas. Some of the YSOs found
in the κ Ori region by Megeath et al. (2012) may belong
to the shell; a bimodal distribution of the X-ray lumi-
nosities in L1641 S suggest that a fraction of the stars
in L1641 S may be part of this foreground cluster. The
WISE survey shows no clear evidence for a population
of young stars with disks interior to the shell beyond the
estimated rate of contamination; however, given the age
estimates for κ Ori of 7 Myr, the dusty gas disks should
have disappeared and would not be detectable by WISE.
Ochsendorf et al. (2015) present a revised picture of the
Orion-Eridanus super bubble, establishing a larger size of
the super bubble and demonstrating that Barnards Loop,
the λ Ori bubble, as well as G206-17+13 are shells pow-
ered by supernovae and stellar winds expanding into the

super bubble. In cases where the shells are not ionized
by the OB association, such as in the λ Ori bubble, the
gas can cool and collapse to form the next generation
of stars. The presence of intermediate velocity absorp-
tion features toward κ Ori conﬁrms that is located in the
super bubble.
While the estimated age of κ Ori is 7 Myr, two velocity
components in the CO (J = 1−0) lines separated by 7 km
s−1 imply a dynamical age of the shell of 1.5 Myr (Wilson
et al. 2005). This means that there was suﬃcient time
for the winds of κ Ori to sweep up the shell. The star
formation in the shell is 2 − 5 Myr old, consistent with a
scenario in which the formation of these stars has been
triggered by κ Ori.

5. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented the results from two XMM-Newton
observations of two regions west to κ Ori containing a
few dozens of YSOs. We have detected a total of 238
X-ray sources, 134 sources in ﬁeld KS and 104 in ﬁeld
KN. We found matches in the IR catalog of YSOs by
Megeath et al. (2012) for 206 of them, 50 X-ray sources
are stars with disks, 4 protostars and 57 candidates Class
III stars.

We ﬁnd evidence of a number of YSOs surrounding
κ Ori and completely unrelated to Orion A. The distri-
butions of X-ray luminosities show that the YSOs are
incompatible with the distance of Orion A and ONC.
Rather, a closer distance of 250 − 280 pc is favored, the
same distance as measured to κ Ori. Together with evi-
dence from mid-IR and far-IR photometry and CO maps,
we speculate that the YSOs in the XMM-Newton ﬁelds,
as well the group of YSOs around V1818 Ori and some
YSOs in the very southern tail of L1641, form a distinct
star forming shell with κ Ori as its most massive member.
in particular
those of GAIA, the κ Ori ring will be one of several
nested shells found in the Orion-Eridanus superbubble
as examples of star formation mechanisms where mas-
sive stars sweep up the gas and dust in the hot interiors
of superbubbles to form shells of cold, star forming gas.

If conﬁrmed by future measurements,
