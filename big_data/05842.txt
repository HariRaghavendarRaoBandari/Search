Sciences, PL-31342 Krak´ow, Poland

The framework of leading-order anisotropic hydrodynamics is supple-
mented with realistic equation of state and self-consistent freeze-out pre-
scription. The model is applied to central proton-nucleus collisions. The re-
sults are compared to those obtained within standard Israel-Stewart second-
order viscous hydrodynamics. It is shown that the resulting hadron spectra
are highly-sensitive to the hydrodynamic approach that has been used.

1. Introduction

One of the most surprising outcomes of the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion
experiments was to show that the new state of matter, the so called quark-
gluon plasma (QGP), created in these reactions forms a strongly-coupled
and correlated system with the smallest viscosity in Nature. As a result,
its space-time evolution may be, to the great extent, described within the
framework of relativistic viscous ﬂuid dynamics. The application of the
latter is complicated by the fact that at the early stages of the evolution
there are locally large momentum-space anisotropies present in the system,
which eventually make the standard framework to break down.
In order
to account for this a great theoretical development of the relativistic ﬂuid
dynamics was done in the recent years. In particular, a new ﬂuid dynamical
framework, called anisotropic hydrodynamics was proposed [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11], which is based on the reorganization of the hydrodynamic
expansion around the anisotropic background. At the same time, in order to
account for small viscous-like corrections, the framework was generalized by
adding linear perturbations to the leading-order term [12, 13, 14]. Already
at leading order the framework of anisotropic hydrodynamics was shown

to agree very well with exact solutions of the underlying relaxation-type
kinetic theory equations in the special cases of the Bjorken [15, 16, 17]
and Gubser [18, 19, 20] velocity proﬁles. Only recently the framework of
anisotropic hydrodynamics was supplemented with the realistic quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) equation of state and the freeze-out prescription
allowing it to be applied to the central A-A and p-A collisions [21], see
also [22]. In this proceedings contribution we brieﬂy review the framework
presented in Ref. [21] and present its main results for p-A reactions.

2. Leading-order anisotropic hydrodynamics

In the case of central collisions at ultra-relativistic energies, considered
in this work, one can restrict oneself to the boost-invariant and cylindri-
cally symmetric (1+1)-dimensional system. Using the exact solutions of
the kinetic theory equations [20] it was shown that within this symme-
try the actual distribution function may be very well approximated by the

ellipsoidal form f aniso = f eq(cid:0)(cid:112)pµΞµνpν/λ(cid:1) [6, 8, 20], where f eq is an equi-

librium distribution function, Ξµν = uµuν + ξµν, and the anisotropy ten-
sor in local rest frame (LRF) reads ξµν
LRF = diag (0, ξx, ξy, ξz) and satisﬁes
ξµ
µ = 0. The ﬂow four-vector uµ is restricted by the symmetry to the form
uµ = (cosh θ⊥ cosh η, sinh θ⊥ cos φ, sinh θ⊥ sin φ, cosh θ⊥ sinh η). The equa-
tions of motion of anisotropic hydrodynamics are obtained by taking ﬁrst
and second moments of the Boltzmann kinetic equation in the relaxation-
√
time approximation [8, 9]. As a result one obtains four coupled partial dif-
ferential equations for anisotropy parameters αx and αz (αi = 1/
1 + ξi),
transverse momentum scale λ and transverse rapidity of the ﬂuid θ⊥ [8, 9].
For a conformal system the following equation of state holds [20, 21]

E = Eeq(λ)R(αx, αz) ,
Px = Peq(λ)HT x(αx, αz) ,
Py = Peq(λ)HT y(αx, αz) ,
Pz = Peq(λ)HL(αx, αz) ,

where Eeq and Peq are the equilibrium expressions for the temperature de-
pendence of energy density and pressure of the ideal gas of massless particles,
respectively, Pi are pressures acting in i-th direction and the functions R
and H are deﬁned in Ref. [21]. In order to include the realistic equation of
state we exchange energy density and pressure of the ideal gas with the cor-
responding functions obtained within lattice QCD (lQCD) simulations by
the Wuppertal-Budapest collaboration [23] (Eeq → ElQCD, Peq → PlQCD).
Another important ingredient required for a realistic description of the
QGP evolution is the self-consistent description of the decoupling of the

system. For this purpose we assume that the momentum distribution of
hadron spectra results from the Cooper-Frye formula applied to the ellip-
soidal form f aniso on the isothermal freeze-out hypersurface. To set the
initial energy density proﬁle for our simulations we employ standard optical
Glauber model.

3. Results and conclusions

We apply the leading-order anisotropic hydrodynamics framework to the
central p-P b collisions, and compare its results with standard Israel-Stewart
hydrodynamics. In Fig. 1 we present the comparison of the resulting π0 pT -
spectra (a) together with their logarithmic slope (b) for the two approaches.
One can see that the former (dashed blue lines) predicts much harder spectra
than the viscous hydrodynamics (solid black lines), which may be traced
back to the fact that the pressure anisotropy is signiﬁcantly overestimated
in Israel-Stewart approach [21]. Moreover, one can also see that the self-
consistent inclusion of anisotropy corrections at the freeze-out (dashed blue
lines), compared to the case where the corrections are neglected (dashed-
dotted green lines), leads to large corrections to the ﬁnal spectra. It means
that in small systems the oﬀ-equilibrium corrections are signiﬁcant at the
time when the system decouples and must be included properly.

Since the anisotropic hydrodynamics was shown to agree much better
with the underlying kinetic theory than the Israel-Stewart theory [15, 16,
17, 18, 19, 20] we conclude that the anisotropic hydrodynamics leads to
dramatic improvement of the description of the evolution of matter in heavy-
ion collisions, especially when one considers asymmetric p-P b reactions.
