Abstract: We study 1/4 Bogomol’nyi-Prasad-Sommerﬁeld (BPS) composite soli-
tons of vortex strings, domain walls and boojums in N = 2 supersymmetric Abelian
gauge theories in four dimensions. We obtain solutions to the 1/4 BPS equations with
the ﬁnite gauge coupling constant. To obtain numerical solutions for generic cou-
pling constants, we construct globally correct approximate functions which allow us
to easily ﬁnd ﬁxed points of a gradient ﬂow equations. We analytically/numerically
conﬁrm that the negative mass of a single boojum appearing at the end point of the
vortex string on the logarithmically bent domain wall is equal to the half-mass of
the ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole. We examine various conﬁgurations and clarify how
the shape of the boojum depends on the coupling constants and moduli parameters.
We ﬁnd a semi-local boojum with a size moduli which appears when the semi-local
string ends on the domain wall. We introduce a “magnetic” scalar potential which
oﬀers an intuitive understanding that the end point of vortex string is the source of
magnetic ﬁeld. It can explain that “height” of the domain wall corresponds to the
magnetic scalar potential, but also it gives a physical meaning to the scalar function
appearing in the Taubes’ equation for BPS Abrikosov-Nilsen-Olesen vortex. Dyonic
solutions are also obtained. When the conﬁguration is extended to the dyonic case,
the domain wall becomes an electric capacitor storing electric charges on its skin and

the boojum charge density becomes proportional to (cid:126)E · (cid:126)B. We also ﬁnd analytic

solutions to the 1/4 BPS equations for speciﬁc values of the coupling constants. We
study the composite solitons from the view points of the Nambu-Goto and Dirac-
Born-Infeld actions, and ﬁnd the semi-local BIon as the counterpart of the semi-local
Boojum.

1. Introduction and summary

Topological solitons have long been appreciated in various ﬁelds in modern physics
such as string theory, ﬁeld theory, cosmology, nuclear physics and condensed matter
physics. They often appear with spontaneously broken symmetries which support
stability of the solutions with conserved topological charges. Typical examples are
Nielsen-Olesen vortex string in the Abelian-Higgs model [1] and ’t Hooft-Polyakov
magnetic monopole in SU (2) Yang-Mills theory [2, 3]. The topological charges are
associated with the homotopy groups π1(U (1)) and π2(SU (2)/U (1)), respectively.
Domain walls also often appear in models with degenerate and discrete vacua which
are characterized by the homotopy group π0(Mvac), where Mvac is a vacuum mani-
fold.

In addition to these elementary solitons, there are also composite solitons, which
include two or more diﬀerent kinds of elementary solitons. They are sometimes called
D-brane solitons or ﬁeld theoretical D-branes, because they share many properties
with D-branes in superstring theories [4]. Among various conﬁgurations, in this
paper we are especially interested in composite solitons, where vortex strings attach
to domain walls. Such conﬁgurations are natural ﬁeld theory counterparts to the D-
branes on which fundamental strings end in superstring theory. These conﬁgurations
have been studied for a long time. A simple ﬁeld theoretical model possessing the
composite soliton was provided in Ref. [5]. Numerical analysis based on the speciﬁc
scalar ﬁeld theory was performed in [6]. Existence of such conﬁgurations in N = 1
supersymmetric (SUSY) QCD was found in [7], and inspired by this result, qualitative
explanation of existence of a vortex-string ending on a domain wall was shown in
[8, 9]. It was found that annihilation of domain wall and anti-domain wall produces
stable solitons of lower dimensionality [10] in a modiﬁed model of N = 1 SUSY QCD
[7].

A remarkable progress was done in [11], in which an exact solution of a lump-
string ending on a domain wall was found as a Bogomol’nyi-Prasad-Sommeﬁeld

– 2 –

(BPS) state preserving 1/4 SUSY in N = 2 SUSY massive nonlinear sigma model
on the cotangent bundle over the complex projective space, T ∗CP 1.
It was also
shown there that Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action correctly describes the low energy
eﬀective dynamics on the domain wall’s world-volume. The lump string ending on
the domain wall can be seen as a Boln-Infeld-on (BIon), a spiky soliton of DBI ac-
tion, which provides a natural interpretation for the string end point as an electric
charge on the domain wall. Furthermore, it was observed that the vortex-string pulls
the domain wall, and consequently the domain wall is logarithmically bent, which is
again intriguingly similar to the D-branes.

Perhaps one of the best playgrounds to study composite state of the vortex
string and the domain wall are N = 2 SUSY gauge theories. Indeed, the massive
T ∗CP 1 model can be realized as a strong (inﬁnite) gauge coupling limit of N = 2
SQED with NF = 2 hypermultiplets in the presence of the Fayet-Iliopoulos term.
The manifold T ∗CP 1 appears as the Higgs branch of SQED. One advantage of SUSY
gauge theory with ﬁnite gauge coupling constant is that the vortex strings are regular
with a ﬁnite width of the order ∼ 1/(gv), where g is the gauge coupling constant
and v is the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the charged scalar ﬁelds. On
the other hand, lump strings in the massive nonlinear sigma models are singular if
put into the bulk without ending on any domain walls. When the lump string is

attached to the domain wall, its transverse size falls of asymptotically as ∼ e−mL

with the distance from the domain wall L and with m being a massive parameter
of dimension one [11]. Therefore, the lump string is asymptotically singular. A
disadvantage of SUSY gauge theories is that analytic solutions of solitons are hard
to obtain, whereas sigma models solitons are often found analytically. Due to this
lack of analytical solutions, studies of composite solitons in the gauge theories seldom
goes beyond their qualitative features.

Nevertheless, much progress has been done within SUSY gauge theories in the
past decade. In N = 2 SQED, seen as a low energy eﬀective theory of N = 2 SQCD
with SU (2) gauge group with NF = 2 hypermultiplets, perturbed by a small mass
term for the adjoint scalar ﬁeld, the 1/4 BPS equations for the Abelian vortex strings
ending on the domain walls were ﬁrst derived in [12]. End points of the vortex strings
on the domain wall were identiﬁed with electric particles in a low energy eﬀective
theory of the domain wall. Then the model was extended to N = 2 SU (2) × U (1)
SQCD with NF = 4 hypermultiplets [13] and the 1/4 BPS equations including the
non-Abelian vortex strings [14, 15] were found. A low energy eﬀective theory on
the composite domain walls was studied and it was found that the end points of
the non-Abelian vortex strings play the role of a non-Abelian charge coupled with
localized dual non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds at linear level of small ﬂuctuations [13], see
also related works [16, 17, 18, 19, 20].

Almost in the same period, the diﬀerent kind of the 1/4 BPS composite conﬁgu-
rations of the non-Abelian vortex and the magnetic monopoles were found in N = 2

– 3 –

U (NC) SQCD with NF = NC ﬂavors [15, 21, 22, 23, 24], see also recent related works
[25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. Afterwards, all these kinds of topological solitons, the vortex
strings, domain walls and the magnetic monopoles were found to coexist as the 1/4
BPS composite states in N = 2 U (NC) SQCD with NF ≥ NC ﬂavors. The most
generic 1/4 BPS equations for these were found in [30]. The BPS equations are a set
of ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations for the gauge ﬁelds Aa
µ, the adjoint scalar ﬁelds
C), and NC × NF squark ﬁelds H and ˆH, which depends on
Σa (a = 1, 2,··· , N 2
three spacial coordinates xk (k = 1, 2, 3). Since, except for several simplest conﬁg-
urations, the generic solutions have no spacial symmetries, it is quite hard to solve
the BPS equations, even though they are ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations. To make
things worse, no analytic solutions to the 1/4 BPS equations have been found in the
model with ﬁnite gauge coupling constants. In order to overcome these diﬃculties
a powerful technique, so-called moduli matrix formalism, was invented for the 1/2
BPS domain walls [31, 32], 1/2 BPS vortex strings [33] and for the full 1/4 BPS
equations [30]. It is so powerful that not only the dimension of the moduli space
but also all the information on the moduli parameters for all topological sectors are
easily exhausted. Notably, the moduli matrix formalism provides all exact solutions
in the strong gauge coupling limit where the model reduces to the massive nonlinear
sigma model whose target space is a cotangent bundle over Grassmannian manifold
GrNF ,NC (cid:39) SU (NF )/SU (NC) × SU (NF − NC) × U (1) [30]. The case with NC = 1
and NF = 2 corresponds to the massive T ∗CP 1 nonlinear sigma model and the mod-
uli matrix formalism correctly reproduces the results in Ref. [11] mentioned above.
There is another advantage of the moduli matrix formalism, though less emphasized
in the literature, that the complicated ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations for 2N 2
C ﬁelds
in the vector multiplet and 2NCNF ﬁelds in the hypermultiplet ( ˆH = 0) are converted
into NC(NC + 1)/2 second order equations, collectively called the master equation

(1.1)

for real positive NC × NC matrix ﬁeld Ω [30], where g is the U (NC) gauge coupling
constant, v2 is the FI parameter and Ω0 stands for a source term, which can be
chosen quite freely up to certain rules [30]. Even in the case NF = NC, for which
the moduli matrix formalism gives a minimal beneﬁt, the degrees of freedom reduces
by half. Details of the moduli matrix formalism are summarized in the review paper
[34]. Also, there are good reviews covering many studies of the topological solitons
in N = 2 SQCD [35, 36, 37, 38].

While many properties are shared by BPS topological solitons in ﬁeld theory and
D-branes in string theory, there is a BPS object, which is inherently ﬁeld theoretical
and has no analog in string theory. It appears at a junction point where two diﬀerent
kind of topological solitons meet. Interestingly, it has a negative BPS mass and can
be interpreted as a binding energy. The ﬁrst example of this kind of object was

– 4 –

found as the domain wall junction [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44]. When a vortex string ends
on a domain wall, a diﬀerent type of BPS object with negative mass appears [30].
Like the domain wall junctions, it was shown that the negative BPS mass is nothing
but the binding energy of the vortex string and the domain wall [45]. In particle
physics context it is now called the boojum [45] because a similar conﬁguration,
coined Boojum1 by Mermin, is known in the context of 3He superﬂuid [46, 47].
Recently, the boojums are getting more popular in various ﬁelds. For example, it
has been studied in the 2 component Bose Einstein condensates [48, 49], and also
in the dense QCD [50, 51]. The negative BPS binding energy was also found for
intersections of vortex sheets in 5 dimensions [22, 52, 53]. Typically, these negative
BPS masses appear in Abelian-Higgs model and these three diﬀerent binding energies
in diﬀerent dimensions can be reasonably understood through a descent relations
given by Kaluza-Klein dimensional reductions [54].

Our main aim in this paper is to study the 1/4 BPS boojums in details in
N = 2 SUSY QED with NF ≥ 2 ﬂavors in the presence of the Fayet-Iliopoulos
term. If one desires, one can think of this theory as a low energy eﬀective theory
of the mass perturbed SU (2) SQCD as considered in [12]. As mentioned above,
fundamental results such as the derivation of the BPS equations, the BPS masses
and the structure of the moduli space were already done [30, 34], and the interaction
rules of various solitons and some qualitative features were clariﬁed [45]. However,
we would like to point out that these understandings still remain at qualitative level.
This is because neither analytic nor numerical solutions to the 1/4 BPS equations
have been obtained. Although all exact solutions to the 1/4 BPS equations were
obtained [30], it was done only in the strong gauge coupling limit where the BPS
boojum masses becomes zero and the lump strings in the bulk are singular.
In
order to ﬁll this hole, we will provide both numerical solutions for generic case and
analytical solutions for particular cases with the gauge coupling constant kept ﬁnite.
To this end, we are greatly helped by the moduli matrix formalism [30, 34], which
reduces the complicated 1/4 BPS equations to a mere second order equation for a
single real scalar ﬁeld u(xk)

(1.2)

which is the Abelian version of the master equation given in Eq. (1.1) with identiﬁ-
cation Ω = eu. In this paper, we will in particular explain how to solve this Abelian
master equation.

At this point, it is worth mentioning that the two dimensional version of Eq. (1.2)
is the well-known Taubes equation for the BPS vortices in the Abelian-Higgs theory
[55]. Unfortunately, no analytic solutions are known for the Taubes equation in
R2. This is in contrast to the familiar BPS Yang-Mills instantons, for which the

– 5 –

well-known Atiyah-Drinfeld-Hitchin-Manin construction is established [56]. However,

Taubes equation on the hyperbolic plane H2 of curvature −1/2 is slightly modiﬁed

from Eq. (1.2), such that the ﬁrst term in the parentheses on the right hand side
vanishes and the equation becomes integrable [57]. This is a consequence of the fact
that these vortices are obtained as a dimensional reduction from SO(3)-symmetric
Yang-Mills instantons on R4 [57]. Recent progress for integrable vortex models are
found in [58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64]. In short, no analytic solutions have been found
for the Taubes equation in R2, much less for the master equation (1.2) in R3. Thus,
it seems almost hopeless to ﬁnd analytic solutions to the master equations (1.2).
Surprisingly, we will provide some exact solutions in both R2 and R3.

In contrast to simplicity of the master equation (1.2), physics behind it is very
rich. We will encounter various interesting phenomena during the process of solving
numerically/analytically the master equation (1.2). A technical but important result
of this paper is ﬁnding a global approximation to solutions of the master equation
(1.2), which supports almost all other results in this paper. In general, solving the
Cauchy boundary problem in R3 for conﬁguration of identical topological solitons,
such as parallel domain walls or parallel vortex strings, is not diﬃcult because ﬁnding
appropriate boundary conditions oﬀers no complications. Even when two identical
topological solitons coexist with a ﬁnite slanting angle, say domain wall junctions,
one may not encounter any diﬃculties in specifying boundary conditions because
the solitons extend linearly to boundary. However, when two or more topological
solitons of diﬀerent kind coexist, giving an appropriate boundary condition is not
always straightforward task. A prototype example is a vortex string attached to a
domain wall from one side. The vortex string has codimension two while the domain
wall has codimension one. As was mentioned above, the domain wall is pulled and
it logarithmically bends toward spacial inﬁnity along the string axis. Thus, in order
to solve the Cauchy boundary problem for this kind of conﬁguration, we have to
have asymptotic solution for bent domain wall. We will provide a simple but very
generic method to construct globally correct approximate solutions from the solu-
tions of constituent isolated solitons. The global approximation oﬀers us quite good
approximate solutions which are valid for not only spacial inﬁnity but also almost all
regions except vicinity of the junction points. What we need is only ﬂat domain wall
solution and straight vortex strings solutions. We will use global approximations not
only for determining the boundary condition of the master equation (1.2) but also for
a suitable initial function consistent with the boundary condition to solve Eq. (1.2)
by the gradient ﬂow (imaginary time relaxation) method. The closer initial function
is to the true solution, the faster the gradient ﬂow converges. Therefore, the global
approximate solution is useful for numerical works. Whatever the solutions for the
constituent solitons are, numerical or analytical, our method works very eﬃciently.
Namely, with the global approximations we can solve the Cauchy problem for any
kind of conﬁguration in the theory with arbitrary coupling constants.

As a direct consequence of solving the BPS equations for the ﬁnite gauge cou-
pling, we will reveal shape of the boojums, see Fig. 4. So far, only schematic picture
such as a simple hemisphere for the boojum have been given in the literature. We will
also show how the shape of the boojums is moddiﬁed when the coupling constants of
the model are changed. It is also interesting to observe how they deform when mul-
tiple boojums coalesce. Do they behave similarly to the BPS magnetic monopoles,
that it that two separate balls collide and form a donut [65]? Our numerical com-
putations show that the boojums behave very diﬀerently form the monopoles, see
Figs. 24, 25 and 31.

Furthermore, the global approximation developed in this paper would settles
down a problem raised in [66]: Based on approximate solutions it was pointed out
that there is an ambiguity in the deﬁnition of the Boojum mass, which stems from
the ambiguity of deﬁnition of the geometric parameters such as domain wall area and
vortex string length caused by logarithmic bending of the domain wall. As mentioned
above, the boojum mass was originally computed in [45] and it was shown that it is
negative half mass of ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole without any ambiguity. To reach
this value, they simpliﬁed their calculation by taking a mean value for the scalar
ﬁeld in the vector multiplet at a cross section of logarithmically bend domain wall
[45]. Although the result – the negative half of ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole – seems
to be plausible, the validity for taking the average is not very clear because the cross
section is exponentially large far away from the junction point. We will recalculate
the boojum mass using the global approximation and conﬁrm that the calculation
in [45] is correct without any ambiguity. In [66], they also considered the case of two
vortex-strings attached from the both sides of the domain wall, ending at diﬀerent
points (see Fig. 26). According to [66], this setting raises another problem about
localization of the binding energy. Two possibilities are considered: One is that the
binding energy locates around the junction points only and the other is that the
binding energy is also localized half way between the strings endings. Our numerical
computation conﬁrms the former scenario, as is clearly visible in Fig. 21.

With the solutions at hand, we can clearly observe the magnetic ﬁelds expanding
in the domain walls which are injected through the vortex strings. The ﬁgures drawn
from the solutions, see Fig. 18 as a typical example, naturally invite an identiﬁcation
of the end points of the vortex strings with point-like sources in the domain wall. We
would like to emphasize that this identiﬁcation works quite well before integrating
over the normal direction to the domain walls. Often, the end points are interpreted
as electric point charges in low energy eﬀective theory in 2 + 1 dimensional world
volume of the domain walls [11, 12, 13]. On the contrary, we will identify the end
points with magnetic point-like sources from the 3 + 1 dimensional view point by
taking the thickness of the domain walls into account. We will show that the two
dimensional distribution of the magnetic ﬂux inside the domain wall can be correctly
reproduced by gradient of a scalar function, which we will call the magnetic scalar

– 7 –

potential. Interestingly, the magnetic scalar potential corresponds to “height” of the
domain wall. Namely, we will prove that the shape of the domain wall determines
the magnetic force inside the domain walls. Further insights along this direction will
be brought by the global approximate solutions. We will show that the domain wall’s
position can be approximately – but precisely enough – identiﬁed with the solution
u(x1, x2) to the Taubes equation, Eq. (1.2) with k = 1, 2, up to a constant.

Thanks to the usefulness of the global approximations, we can now engineer
any kind of conﬁgurations, no matter how complicated they are. As an interesting
example, we will obtain numerical solution to a conﬁguration of periodically aligned
vortex strings attached to the domain wall. The shape of the domain wall exhibits
a linear rather than logarithmic structure. This is expected once we identify the
end points to the point-like charges. Suppose that inﬁnite number of point charges
are placed periodically on a line. The ﬂux lines from those charges asymptotically
become parallel, therefore the scalar potential too becomes linear suﬃciently far
away. In the setup, as mentioned above, the point charges are magnetic charges and
the magnetic scalar potential corresponds to the domain wall’s position/shape. Then
we will consider the conﬁguration, where periodically aligned vortex strings end on
the domain wall from one side and another inﬁnite series of the vortex strings end on
the opposite side. As can be easily imagined, such conﬁguration resembles magnetic
capacitor. We compute the magnetic capacitance per unit length and energy stored
there. When we separate the two parallel lines of end points far away, ﬂat but slant
domain wall remains in between with non-zero magnetic ﬂux inside. This is similar
to a D-brane with magnetic ﬂux. Putting additional vortex string ending on the tilt
domain wall, the magnetic ﬂux spreading inside the domain wall shows again one
dimensional structure, which is almost the same as an electric charge placed in an
electric capacitor. Similar conﬁguration was already obtained in the strong gauge
coupling limit [30] and our solution is for the ﬁnite gauge coupling case. This oﬀers
a ﬁeld theoretical D-brane resembling the fundamental string ending on the D-brane
with magnetic ﬂux [67, 68].

We also study a dyonic extension of the 1/4 BPS solutions. Although the BPS
equations were derived in [54, 69], no solutions have been obtained in the literature,
except for the strong gauge coupling limit [11]. We will ﬁrst study the 1/2 BPS dyonic
domain walls which are ﬁnite gauge coupling version of the Q-kinks [70, 71]. We will
ﬁnd that positive and negative electric charges are induced on the skin of the domain
wall. As a consequence, the dyonic domain wall in the weak gauge coupling region
is an electric capacitor. Then, we will numerically solve the master equation for the
dyonic 1/4 BPS conﬁguration again with an aid of the global approximate solutions.
When a vortex string attaches to the dyonic domain wall, both the magnetic and
electric ﬂuxes coexist inside the domain wall. We will show that almost everywhere
except for the vicinity of the junction point, the electric ﬂux (cid:126)B and the magnetic ﬂux
(cid:126)B are perpendicular. (cid:126)E and (cid:126)B becomes parallel around the junctions points, and,

– 8 –

indeed, we can show the boojum charge is proportional to (cid:126)E· (cid:126)B, which is CP-violating

interaction.

As a novel solution, which has not been studied previously, we ﬁnd a semi-local
boojum which appears at the end point of the semi-local vortex string [72] on the
domain wall in the model with multiple ﬂavors NF ≥ 3 with partially degenerate
masses for the hypermultiplets. It has an additional zero mode related to size of the
string diameter. We ﬁnd that the semi-local boojum change its size unison with the
size of the attached semi-local vortex string.

We have another progress. We have stressed that no analytic solutions have
been found for the master equation (1.2) so far. Situation is the same even for
much simpler case of the Taubes equation, Eq. (1.2) in R2, for the local vortices.
Thus, one might think that there is no hope to ﬁnd analytic solutions to the master
equations (1.2) either in R2 or R3. Contrary to expectations, we will obtain several
analytic exact solutions to the Taubes equation for speciﬁc semi-local vortices in
R2. Furthermore, combining this with the known exact solutions to the master
equation in R1 for the domain walls [73] in a similar way with which we made the
global approximate solution, we will, surprisingly, succeed in constructing analytic
solutions to the master equation (1.2) in R3. In connection with these results, we
will also develop accurate approximation to the individual vortex string and domain
wall solutions, which are useful to quickly obtain the global approximation for the
1/4 BPS solutions.

Finally, we will study the 1/4 BPS conﬁguration from the view point of the low
energy eﬀective action, the Nambu-Goto action and the DBI action, for the domain
wall. This kind of study was already performed for example, in [11, 12, 13, 16].
In these previous works, as the low energy eﬀective action, the DBI action (or its
linearization) which is obtained by dualizing the internal moduli of the domain wall
to the Abelian gauge ﬁeld was studied. In our paper, we study both the Nambu-
Goto action and the DBI action. We ﬁrst investigate the domain wall and its Q-
extension (dyonic extension) in the Nambu-Goto action and ﬁnd that the energy of
those conﬁguration coincides with one in the ﬁeld theoretical model. Secondly, we
study the case that a point source of zero size deforms the domain wall to a spike
conﬁguration in the Nambu-Goto action. This is precisely counter part of the Q-lump
string ending on the domain wall in the strong gauge coupling limit in the original
ﬁeld theory. After that we study the relation between the Nambu-Goto action and
the DBI action. We brieﬂy explain how the Nambu-Goto action is dualized to the
DBI action. By using the relations so obtained, we also transform the energy and
the BPS equation for the dyonic extension of the spike conﬁguration in terms of the
DBI language. We show that the results are the same one as in [11]. By using the
DBI action, we also study a point-like source with a ﬁnite size which should be a
counterpart of the semi-local boojum. We ﬁnd the semi-local BIon which, contrary
to local BIon, has the tip of its spike smoothed out with the same order as the size

– 9 –

of the source.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review our model, which
is N = 2 supersymmetric U (1) gauge theory in (3 + 1)-dimensions coupled to NF
hypermultiplets. We derive the BPS equations for the boojum conﬁguration, pre-
serving 1/4 supersymmetry and shows that they reduce to one diﬀerential equation
(1.2). In Section 3, we deal with the axially symmetric conﬁguration, namely one
vortex string ending on the domain wall. We show all the basic properties of the
boojum there. Then, we demonstrate more complicated solutions, where multiple
vortex strings end on the domain walls in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to study
periodically aligned vortex strings. We investigate the magnetic capacitor there. In
Section 6, we study the dyonic extension of the 1/4 BPS states. We ﬁnd that the
domain wall plays a role of an electric capacitor and show several numerical solutions.
We develop a useful and accurate approximation for the ANO vortex and the domain
walls in Section 7. We give several exact solutions to the 1/2 and 1/4 BPS equations
in Section 8. Section 9 is devoted to analysis from the perspective of Nambu-Goto
action together with analysis in terms of the DBI action. A brief discussion of the
future work is given in Section 10.

2. The Model

2.1 Abelian vortex-wall system

Let us consider N = 2 supersymmetric U (1) gauge theory in (3+1)-dimensions with
2NF complex scalar ﬁelds in the charged hypermultiplets. We assemble them into
a row vector H ≡ (H 1, H 2, . . . , H NF ) and ˆH†
≡ ( ˆH 1∗, ˆH 2∗, . . . , ˆH NF ∗). The vector

multiplet include the photon Aµ and a real scalar ﬁeld σ. The bosonic Lagrangian
is given as

where g is a gauge coupling constant, M is a real diagonal matrix

M = diag(m1, . . . , mNF ),

(2.3)

and v is the Fayet-Illiopoulos D-term. Without loss of generality we can take M to
A=1 mA = 0,2 and align the masses as mA > mA+1. Since ˜H
will play no role, we will set ˜H = 0 in the rest of this paper. Throughout this paper,

we use the conventions:

ηµν = diag(+,−,−,−) ,
Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ ,
DµH = ∂µH + iAµH .

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

The quartic coupling in the potential term is written by the gauge coupling
constant g while in general it is not necessary to choose it like this. Such a non-generic
value of the coupling constant allows us to embed this model into a supersymmetric
model with eight supercharges by adding appropriate bosonic and fermionic ﬁelds.
Such a choice of coupling constants make possible reduce the full equations of motion

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

into BPS equations, which are ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations. Solutions to the
BPS equations are called BPS solitons. These ﬁeld conﬁgurations possess many
special properties, such as saturating the energy bound in a given topological sector
and preserving a fraction of supercharges in the supersymmetric theory. These facts
simplify construction and discussion of topological solutions signiﬁcantly. Of course,
one can consider more general values of coupling constants without qualitatively
changing the results. We will focus on the BPS solutions because generic case would
involve much complicated analysis for solving the full equations of motion.

In the absence of the mass matrix M , the Lagrangian (2.1) is invariant under
SU (NF ) ﬂavour transformation of Higgs ﬁelds H → HU , U ∈ SU (NF ). The non-
degenerate masses in M explicitly break this down to U (1)NF −1, which we from now
on assume to be the case unless stated otherwise.

There are NF discrete vacua with representative ﬁeld values

, . . . , 0) ,

σ(cid:104)k(cid:105) = mA ,

(A = 1, . . . , NF ) .

(2.10)

H(cid:104)A(cid:105) = (0, . . . , v(cid:124)(cid:123)(cid:122)(cid:125)A−th

We can act on each of these conﬁgurations by NF global U (1) transformations, which
make each vacuum topologically a circle. Thus, the space of all vacuum conﬁgurations
– the manifold V – is isomorphic to NF -torus V ∼ S1 × S1 × . . . × S1. A direct
consequence of this fact is that the model (2.1) has a rich spectrum of topological
excitations [21, 30, 45].

Non-trivial homotopy groups π0(V) = ZNF and π1(V) = Z× Z× . . .× Z give rise

to a large variety of domains walls and vortex strings. These solitons are 1/2 BPS
solitons, as they preserve half of the supercharges if the model is extended to have

– 11 –

supersymmetry. In addition, there are also lots of composite solitons, where vortex
strings attach to the domain walls. These conﬁgurations preserve 1/4 of supercharges
and hence are known as 1/4 BPS solitons, which we are interested in.

2.2 1/4 BPS state

Let us now construct the 1/4 BPS solitons. We will arrange vortex strings to be
parallel to the x3 axis and the domain walls to be perpendicular to the x3 axis. We
let A0 = 0 and consider static conﬁgurations, so that the Higgs ﬁeld H, the scalar σ
and the gauge ﬁeld Ak(k = 1, 2, 3) are independent on x0. The Bogomol’nyi bound
is then obtained as3

tions of motion (2.7)-(2.9) for all values of parameters η2 = ξ2 = 1, where ξ = (−1)1
labels (anti-)vortices and η = (−1)1 denotes (anti-)walls.
TW and TS, the domain wall and the vortex string energy density respectively,
are positive defenite. TB is the so-called boojum energy density, which is interpreted
as binding energy of vortex string attached to the domain wall, since it is negative
irrespective the signs of η and ξ [45, 66]. The total energy of 1/4 BPS soliton is
obtained upon the space integration and it consists of three parts4

E1/4 = TW A + TSL + TB ,

(2.20)

where we have denoted sum of tensions of the domain walls TW =(cid:82) dx3 TW , and that
of the vortex strings TS =(cid:82) dx1dx2 TS, respectively. A =(cid:82) dx1dx2 and L =(cid:82) dx3
boojums TB =(cid:82) d3x TB are ﬁnite. Let tW (A, A + 1) be the tension of elementary

stand for the domain wall’s area and length of the vortex string. Only masses of the

domain wall interpolating the vacua (cid:104)A(cid:105) and (cid:104)A + 1(cid:105) [30]
tW (A, A + 1) = v2|mA+1 − mA|.
TW =(cid:88) tW = v2|∆m|, TS = 2πv2|k|,

Summing up all the elementary domain walls and vortex strings, we have

x3=−∞ and k ∈ Z stands for the number of vortex

where we have denoted ∆m = [σ]x3=+∞
strings. TB has been also calculated in [30, 45, 66]. But, there is a discussion about
determining the mass of a single boojum which appears as a junction of the semi-
inﬁnite string ending on a logarithmically bent domain wall. In what follows, we will
conﬁrm without doubt that the boojum mass even for bent domain walls is given by
the following formula [45]

(2.21)

(2.22)

TB =(cid:88)−

2π
g2 |mA+1 − mA|,

(2.23)

where the sum is taken for all the junctions of domain walls and vortex strings in
the solution under consideration.

2.3 The moduli matrix formalism

With the use of the moduli matrix approach [31, 30, 34] the set of the equations
(2.16)–(2.19) amounts to solving one equation called the master equation. It is easy
to see that the following ansatz solves (2.16)–(2.18)

H = ve− u

2 H0(z)eηM x3 , A1 + iξA2 = −i∂¯zu ,

ησ + iA3 =

(2.24)

4The total energy of any 1/4 BPS conﬁguration is, of course, inﬁnite, thus the equality has

meaning only after employing some regularization procedure.

– 13 –

where H0(z) is the so-called the moduli matrix which is holomorphic in a complex
coordinate z ≡ x1 + iξx2. Our notation is ∂¯z = (∂1 + iξ∂2)/2. By using the U (1)
gauge transformation, we ﬁx u = u(z, ¯z, x3) to be real. Then we have A3 = 0. The
last equation (2.19) turns into the master equation

The non-topological current jk given in Eqs. (2.12) and (2.13) can be rewritten in
the following expression by using the BPS equations

jk =

Thus, the scalar function u determines everything.

The moduli matrix formalism is an easy tool for describing the 1/4 BPS solitons.
Indeed, one can construct any kind of conﬁgurations by preparing appropriately
the moduli matrix H0(z) = (h1(z), h2(z),··· , hNF (z)). As a simple example, let
us consider the case that only h1 and h2 are non-zero. The vacuum (cid:104)i(cid:105) is given
by hj = δij (j = 1, 2).
If they are both non zero constants, the corresponding
conﬁguration has the domain wall separating (cid:104)1(cid:105) and (cid:104)2(cid:105) vacua. Since we assume
mA > mA+1, the vacuum (cid:104)1(cid:105) appears on the left hand side of the domain wall
while the vacuum (cid:104)2(cid:105) on the right hand side. When one wants to put N1 vortex
strings in the vacua (cid:104)1(cid:105), one only needs to prepare h1 = P1(z) where P1(z) stands

– 14 –

for a polynomial with degree N1. This can be straightforwardly extended for generic
H0(z).

Hence, the moduli matrix formalism allows us to handle the complicated 1/4
BPS solitons. One can even deal with the solutions belonging to diﬀerent topological
sectors simultaneously. It is nice that all information about the moduli parameters
are included in H0. For these reasons, the moduli matrix formalism has been fre-
quently used in the literature since its inception. Nevertheless, a ﬁnishing touch has
been omitted in the sense that no analytic or numerical solutions have been con-
structed for the master equation (2.25) except for the strong gauge coupling limit
g2 → ∞ [31] as was mentioned in the Introduction. In the literature, only schematic
pictures in the weak/strong gauge coupling region has been given []. This lack of
solutions also caused some confusion about the deﬁnition of the boojum [66], which
we will mention later.

3. Axially symmetric solutions

In this section we explain how we numerically solve the master equation (2.25).
Throughout this section, we will concentrate on NF = 2 case but everything ad-
dressed here can be straightforwardly extended to generic case. For ease of notation,
we will use the following dimensionless coordinates and mass

˜M =

(3.13)

In what follows, we will not distinguish xk and ˜xk, unless stated otherwise. An
exception is the mass: we will use the notation ˜m in order not to forget that we are
using the dimensionless variables. Then the master equation (2.25) is expressed as

∂2

ku − 1 + Ω0e−u = 0, Ω0 = H

(3.14)

If the moduli matrix is constant, we have ﬂat domain walls and the function

u = uW (x3) depend only on x3 coordinate. The reduced master equation reads

∂2

3uW − 1 + Ω0e−uW = 0.

(3.15)

Similarly, when the moduli matrix has only one non-zero component, say H0 =
(Pn(z), 0,··· , 0), the conﬁguration has n vortex strings in the vacuum (cid:104)1(cid:105). One can
eliminate the x3 dependence by deﬁning

u(xk) = uS(x1, x2) + η ˜mx3.

Then the master equation reduces to

(∂2

1 + ∂2

2)uS − 1 + |Pn|2e−uS = 0.

(3.16)

3.1 Gradient ﬂow

Now we are ready to solve the master equation Eq. (3.14) numerically. But, instead
of solving it directly, we will solve the so-called gradient ﬂow equation

coupling), respectively. The horizontal axis is in dimensionless coordinate ˜x3 = gvx3.

for U = U (xk, t), using appropriate initial conﬁguration U (xk, 0) and boundary con-
ditions. Normally, U (xi, t) rapidly converges to a static function. When ∂tU (xk, t)
becomes negligibly small at a suﬃciently large t, we regard U (xk, t) as a solution
u(xk) of the original master equation,

u(xk) = lim

t→∞ U (xk, t).

(3.19)

Final state obtained in this way depends on the initial conﬁguration and the bound-
ary conditions. Thus, the necessary step to successfully solve Eq. (3.18) is to provide
an initial conﬁguration compatible with the boundary conditions.

3.1.1 Domain wall solutions

Solving the gradient ﬂow equation is not diﬃcult especially for a single type of
solitons like the ﬂat domain walls or the straight vortex strings. For the domain
walls perpendicular to the x3 axis, the master equation reduces to Eq. (3.15). The

for U = UW (x3, t)

∂2

3UW − 1 + Ω0(x3)e−UW = ∂tUW .

(3.20)

A convenient choice of the initial conﬁguration and the boundary conditions at x3 =
±L3 (L3 (cid:29) ˜m) is

UW (x3, 0) = log Ω0(x3), UW (±L3, t) = log Ω0(±L3).

(3.21)

The true solution can be obtained as the asymptotic function uW (x3) = limt→∞ UW (x3, t)
which satisﬁes

uW (x3) →(cid:26) ˜mx3

− ˜mx3

for
for

x3 (cid:29) ˜m ,
x3 → − ˜m .

(3.22)

Several numerical solutions are shown in Fig. 1. There are two qualitatively
diﬀerent domain walls according to ˜m [12].
In the strong gauge coupling limit,
˜m (cid:28) 1, the domain wall has a simple structure as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1.
The traverse size of the domain wall is ˜dW = 2/ ˜m. On the other hand, in the weak
coupling region, ˜m (cid:29) 1, the domain walls consists of two layers [12]: the fundamental
Higgs ﬁeld decays in the outer thin layer whose transverse size is of order 1 (in the
dimensionless unit), whereas the singlet scalar ﬁeld ˜σ interpolates ˜m/2 and − ˜m/2
through the inner fat layer whose transverse size is about ˜dW = 2 ˜m. In the latter
case, the inside of the domain wall remains almost the Coulomb phase since the
charged fundamental ﬁelds are exponentially small there.

3.1.2 Vortex string solutions

The vortex strings can be obtained similarly. As an example, let us consider n vortex
strings in the (cid:104)1(cid:105) vacuum. It is given by the moduli matrix H0 = (Pn(z), 0) with
Pn(z) being the n-th order polynomial. This yields Ω0 = |Pn|2eη ˜mx3. Then we deﬁne
(3.23)

U (xk, t) = US(x1, x2) + η ˜mx3.

This yields ˜σ = η ˜m. The master equation to US for the vortex strings reduces to

(∂2

1 + ∂2

2)US − 1 + |Pn|2e−US = ∂tUS.

(3.24)

Note that ˜m disappears due to the shift given in Eq. (3.23). There are no dimensionful
parameters in this equation, so that everything is of order one. A convenient choice
for the initial and boundary conditions is

US(x1, x2, 0) = log(cid:16)|Pn|2 + e−ρ2(cid:17) ,
US(±L1,±L2, t) = log(cid:32)|Pn|2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x1=±L1,x2=±L2(cid:33) ,

to uS and log ρ2 in the left panel. In the right panel, the red line stands for ˜H1 and
the blue line shows the magnetic ﬂux density ˜TS.

where, of course, we assume |L1,2| (cid:29) 1 so that e−ρ2 can be neglected. The exponen-

tial term appearing in Eq. (3.25) is there in order to avoid singular behavior at the
center of the vortex strings in the initial conﬁguration. It is exponentially small at the
boundary x1 = ±L1 and x2 = ±L2, so that the initial conﬁguration does not contra-
dict to the boundary conditions. As before, the true vortex solution uS for Eq. (3.17)
can be obtained as the asymptotic function uS(x1, x2) = limt→∞ US(x1, x2, t).

A signiﬁcant diﬀerence from the homogeneous solitons is that the boundaries of the
3D box parallel to the vortex string intersect with the curved domain wall and one
of the boundary parallel to the domain wall intersects with the vortex string, see
Fig. 3. Thus, we have to ﬁgure out an appropriate boundary condition consistent
with the curved domain wall.

Let us ﬁrst look at the region far from the vortex string axis, namely ρ (cid:29) 1.

A suitable function possessing these asymptotic behaviors can be obtained by
replacing ρ by euS /2 in the asymptotic function u given in Eq. (3.33). This is our
choice for the initial conﬁguration to solve the gradient ﬂow

thermore, since uW (x3) → ± ˜mx3 for x3 → ±∞ we have U → ± ˜m(cid:0)x3 + 1

Since uS(ρ) → log ρ2 as ρ → ∞, this function is consistent with Eq. (3.33). Fur-

Note that the ﬁrst condition is ensured by ∂ρuS(ρ = 0) = 0. The initial conﬁguration

which is consistent with the asymptotic behavior given in Eq. (3.34). In the strong
gauge coupling limit, we have the exact solution uS = log ρ2, so the asymptotic rela-
tion (3.34) becomes exact for whole ρ. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 2, the domain
wall is smooth everywhere in the ﬁnite gauge coupling, but it gets logarithmically
sharp at the origin in the strong gauge coupling limit.

Having the appropriate initial conﬁguration U, we now solve the gradient ﬂow
equation (3.30). We solve it by using a standard ﬁnite diﬀerence method with the
Crank-Nicolson scheme. A typical solution with ˜m = 1 is shown in Fig. 4. One can
clearly see that the straight vortex string with a ﬁnite diameter ends on the logarith-
mically curved domain wall. This is obvious contrast to previously obtained solutions
with singular vortex strings [11, 30]. Furthermore, most importantly, our solution
has the boojum which contributes to the total energy (the boojum disappears in
the strong coupling limit since the boojum charge is proportional to 1/g2). With
our numerical solution at hand, we ﬁgure out correct shape of the boojum as shown
in Fig. 4. So far, the shape of boojum have been only schematically realized. For
example, in Ref. [45], the boojum was expressed as just a hemisphere which is little

too simple compared to our numerical solution. The third advantage to have the
numerical solution for a ﬁnite gauge coupling is that we can clearly see distribution
of the magnetic ﬂux which enters from the vortex string into the domain wall. In
Fig. 4 we show several lines of the magnetic ﬁeld (blue solid curves). They form a
ﬂux tube inside the vortex string and radially spread out once they enter the domain
wall. This picture can correctly be obtained only for the ﬁnite gauge coupling since
electromagnetic interaction disappears in the strong coupling limit.

The numerical solutions also shed light on both qualitative and quantitative
diﬀerence between the 1/4 BPS conﬁgurations in the strong ( ˜m (cid:29) 1) and the weak
( ˜m (cid:28) 1) gauge coupling regions. Especially, the vicinity of a junction point of the
domain wall and vortex string is hard to correctly understand without numerical
methods. We show the several solutions in details; the proﬁles of the ﬁelds, the
topological charge densities, and the energy densities are displayed in Fig. 5 ( ˜m =
1/5), Fig. 6 ( ˜m = 1) and Fig. 7 ( ˜m = 10).

Since we have rescaled out gv dependence, the asymptotic vortex string conﬁg-
uration is common for all the cases. This can be seen in regions near the top-left
edges of the middle panels of Figs. 5 – 7 in which the topological charge densities

of the magnetic ﬁelds which are slightly diﬀerent from the string topological charge

of the vortex string ˜TS are shown. The bottom-middle panels show the magnitude
density ˜TS.

The ﬁeld ˜H1
develops the non-zero VEV in the upper region (x3 (cid:29) 0). Namely, the light yellow
regions of the top-left panels correspond to the vacuum (cid:104)1(cid:105). Similarly, the yellow
parts of the top-middle panels show region of the vacuum (cid:104)2(cid:105). Since the phase of ˜H1
has the winding number 1 for the vortex string, ˜H1 vanishes at the core of the vortex
string (on the top-left edge (ρ = 0, x3 (cid:29) 0)). Since neither ˜H1 nor ˜H2 develops

non-zero VEV there, the U (1) gauge symmetry is recovered.

Shape of the bent domain wall can be seen in the middle-left panels where the

topological charge density ˜TW is plotted. The yellow-line region of ˜TW is consistent
with the yellow-blue transit region of ˜σ in the top-right panels. The domain wall
strongly bends for the strong coupling ( ˜m (cid:28) 1) while it seems to be almost ﬂat for
the weak coupling ( ˜m (cid:29) 1). This diﬀerence comes from the wall to string tension
ratio, which can be found by comparing the scales of the color bars of the middle-left
and middle-middle panels.

The domain wall tends to strongly bent when the tension of the vortex string is
larger than that of the domain wall. This can be also understood from Eq. (3.34),
which tells that the asymptotic wall curve is x3 (cid:39) − log ρ1/ ˜m. For example, x3(ρ =
10) = − log 10 for the case of ˜m = 1. To get the same amount of bending in the case
of ˜m = 10, one needs to go to ρ = 1010! This is the reason why the domain wall
seems almost ﬂat for ˜m = 10 in the middle-left panel of Fig. 7. It is also seen that
the domain wall at ρ = 0 is not singular for any ˜m. In contrast to the inside of the
vortex string, there are no topological reasons for the domain wall core to be in the
unbroken phase. Indeed, both ˜H1 and ˜H2 are non-zero inside the domain wall with
˜m = 1/5 and 1. This is consistent with the single domain wall solutions given in
Fig. 1. Only when the gauge coupling is very weak ( ˜m (cid:29) 1), the domain wall core
develops the fat inner layer of the unbroken phase. While the diameter of the vortex
string is ﬁxed to be of order one, width of the domain wall varies as ˜m is changed, see
Fig. 1. The domain wall is sharpest when ˜m (cid:39) 1, while it becomes much fatter than
the vortex string for both weak and strong gauge coupling limits, see the bottom-left
panels showing the full energy density including the surface term.

Our prime interest is to understand the junction point of the domain wall and
the vortex string. Especially in the weak coupling limit, since the cores of the vortex
string and domain wall are in the unbroken phase. The top-left and top-middle panels
of Fig. 7 clearly show that the two unbroken regions are just smoothly connected.
We are also interested in the boojum, the binding energy appearing at the junction
point. The middle-right panels exhibit variety of the shape of boojum depending on
˜m. It is basically a smoothed cone which becomes thiner for ˜m (cid:28) 1 and fatter for
˜m (cid:29) 1.

Finally, in the bottom-right panels we plot the mass square of the gauge ﬁeld

The gauge symmetry is recovered in the deep-blue region, while is strongly broken in
the light-yellow region. In addition, we also plot ﬂow of the magnetic ﬁeld (magnetic
force lines). In general, the ﬂow tend to be concentrated into the region where the
gauge symmetry is unbroken or weakly broken.
In the case of the strong gauge
coupling ( ˜m = 1/5 given in Fig. 5), the incoming magnetic force lines through
the vortex string are forced to bend when they encounter the domain wall. They
scatter and then spread out along the domain wall because the breaking of the gauge
symmetry is milder inside the domain wall. However, the lines running near the
core of the vortex string are pushed out of the domain wall. This happens because
the energy cost to bend the lines all the way into the core of domain wall is larger
than that to have mildly bending lines going through the bulk. In contrast, in the
intermediate case with ˜m = 1 given in Fig. 6, the magnetic force lines go along the
domain wall. This is because the mass of the gauge ﬁeld inside the domain wall is
suﬃciently small, so that the magnetic force lines bend and tend to go inside the
domain wall. The weak coupling case with ˜m = 10 shown in Fig. 7 has totally
diﬀerent structure. Inside the fat domain wall is the unbroken phase. The incoming
magnetic force lines spread out linearly in the domain wall until they encounter the
other side of the domain wall beyond which is the broken phase.

One should be careful that the (dimensionless) string tension is always 4π even
in the vacuum (cid:104)2(cid:105) side of the domain wall (x3 (cid:28) 0) where we do not put the vortex
string. This is simply a consequence of the ﬂux conservation. The magnetic ﬂux
cannot invade the vacuum (cid:104)2(cid:105), so that it ﬂows along the surface of the domain wall
which logarithmically bends. Therefore, regardless of x3, we always have total ﬂux
of 4π.
In other words, the vortex string is not chopped by the domain wall but
exponentially inﬂates. This observation can also be justiﬁed by seeing the proﬁle of
the scalar ﬁeld H1. The amplitude of the scalar ﬁeld whose phase has the winding
number must necessarily vanish somewhere by a topological reason. Therefore, we
can think of the deep-blue region in the top-left panels of Figs. 5 – 7 as the inside
the vortex trumpet.

Note that the above result reﬂects an accidental Z2 symmetry for our speciﬁc choice

( ˜m1 > ˜m2), the asymptotic behavior of u at a larger ρ becomes u → uW (x3 +

while uW → −( ˜m1 − ˜m2)x3 for x3 (cid:28) −( ˜m1 − ˜m2). It is straightforward to verify the

Thus, we ﬁnd the generic form

As a closing comment for this subsection, we would like to emphasize that we
were able to rigorously calculate the charges thanks to the asymptotic behavior given
in Eq. (3.33). In particular, we calculated the charges by surrounding them with
the ﬁnite size cylinder as shown in Fig. 3. Since we have not touched the spacial
inﬁnity, the above computations do not suﬀer from any complications coming from
logarithmic bending at all. In the literature, several attempts to avoid this problem
have been done. In Ref. [30], the mass of two coaxial boojums was calculated for
the ﬂat domain wall on which one coaxial vortex string ends on from both sides and
found 2TB = −4π(m1 − m2)/g2. Since the domain wall is ﬂat in this case, there
are no anxieties. Then, in the proceeding work [66], it was proposed that the mass
of the single boojum can be obtained by just dividing the mass of the two coaxial
boojums by 2. In the same paper [66], they also discussed that there is an uncertainty
for determining the mass of the single boojum in the case of logarithmically bent
domain wall due to a geometrical ambiguity. Ref. [45] is the ﬁrst work which showed
TB = −2π(m1 − m2)/g2 for the isolated single boojum in the logarithmically curved
domain wall. They reached this value by integrating the mass density TB at x3 = ±∞
goes through the boundary transverse to the vortex string axis. The ﬁrst term
unambiguously equals to −2πm1/g2. The second term is somewhat tricky since
one needs to consider intersection of the logarithmically bent domain wall with the
boundary at x3 = −∞. In Ref. [45], σ was simply replaced by a mean value (m1 +
m2)/2 and made use of the ﬂux conservation, then the second term was found to be
−π(m1 +m2)/g2. Summing up the two contribution gives us TB = −2π(m1−m2)/g2.
This way of computing the boojum mass is plausible, but it might be better to
conﬁrm it by a more rigorous way. We believe that our calculations above contribute
to this point. For further conﬁrmation, we perform the integrations numerically

as TB =(cid:82) dx1dx2 TB(cid:12)(cid:12)x3=∞ −(cid:82) dx1dx2 TB(cid:12)(cid:12)x3=−∞ under the assumption that no ﬂux

and ﬁnd − ˜TB/8π ˜m = 0.976, 0.996, 1.010, 0.997 for ˜m = 1, 10, 20, 30, respectively. In

conclusion, we agree with [45] that the boojum mass can be cleanly separated from
the semi-inﬁnite vortex string and the logarithmically bent domain wall.

3.3 Weak coupling regime

3.3.1 Boojum as a fractional magnetic monopole and monostick

There are no magnetic sources, namely no magnetic monopoles, in our U (1) gauge
theory. Indeed, Bianchi identity ijk∂iFjk = 0 always holds. The non-zero boojum
charge TB seems to yield non-zero magnetic charge, but it is not true. The boojum
ˆFjk (cid:54)= 0 with ˆFij = σFij while it has ijk∂iFjk = 0. Of course, ˆFij = σFij is
has ijk∂i
not a genuine magnetic ﬁeld. Nevertheless, there is a case that the boojum can be
naturally identiﬁed as a magnetic source in the week gauge coupling region ˜m (cid:29) 1.
In this region, the domain wall has a fat inner layer of the width ∼ ˜m, where the
U (1) gauge symmetry is almost recovered. When the magnetic ﬂux is injected into

– 31 –

Figure 8: A sketch of a boojum inside the domain wall in the weak coupling re-
gion. The boojum is naturally identiﬁed with the magnetic source with a fractional
magnetic charge (2π/g) which sticks to the inner boundary of the domain wall.

the domain wall through the vortex string, the magnetic ﬂux almost freely spreads
out inside the domain wall, see Fig. 8. Therefore, for one living inside the domain
wall, who is blind to outside world, the boojum is really magnetic source. It is a
point-like source, so one may call it the magnetic monopole. The diﬀerence from the
ordinary magnetic monopole, be it Dirac or ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopole, is that the
boojum sticks to the boundary of the semi-compact world, where he lives.

Note that, here, we are trying to identify the boojum as the magnetic monopole
in the semi-compact space d = 2+1 where 2 corresponds to the 2 dimensional inﬁnite
plane and 1 to the ﬁnite segment of width ∼ ˜m. This is diﬀerent from the well-known
arguments that the end point of the vortex string can be identiﬁed with an electric
charge in the 1 + 2 dimensional (1 is time and 2 space) eﬀective theory of the domain
wall. To this end, one needs to integrate out the normal direction to the domain wall
(x3) and then to dualize the S1 internal moduli parameter to the dual U (1) gauge
ﬁeld in 1 + 2 dimensional spacetime `a la Polyakov. Here, we do not do this and
instead are dealing with the original U (1) gauge ﬁeld.

In Fig. 7, we have already seen that the magnetic ﬂux inside the fat domain wall
( ˜m = 10) linearly spreads for a while until it encounters the boundary. Characteristic
length of this linear spreading is proportional to the width of the inner layer. For
this, we show three extremely wide domain walls in Fig. 9.

˜m = 20 is shown in the blue curve. The red curve shows the Coulomb force with an

appropriate shift x3 → x3− 22.8. The yellow curve corresponds to ˜H1 on the x3 axis.
The region ˜H1 = 0 is in the Coulomb phase. ˜B3 → 1 at the vacuum (cid:104)1(cid:105) corresponds

to the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld at the center of the vortex string.

Here we integrated only on the hemisphere with excluding the boundary of the wall
from the surface integral. We have 4π simply due to the ﬂux conservation, ˜Φboojum =
− ˜Φin. From the Gauss’s law (the integration is taken only on the hemisphere) we

conclude that the magnetic charge of the boojum is

˜MB = 4π.

(3.53)

Note that this is calculated with the dimensionless variables. In terms of the original
variables and with respect to the usual notation Aµ → gAµ, the magnetic charge of
the boojum in a conventional notation is given by

MB =

2π
g

.

(3.54)

This is a half of the magnetic charge MTP = 4π/g of ’t Hoof-Polyakov type magnetic
monopole. Thus, the boojum can be identiﬁed with a fractional magnetic monopole
from the point of view of wall-bound observers.

Since we have solved the equation of motion for the ﬁnite gauge coupling con-
stant, we can check this statement numerically. In the Coulomb phase, the magnetic

ﬁeld of the magnetic charge ˜M stuck on a wall at x3 = X should obey the normal

Note that not 4πr2 but 2πr2 (the area of

hemisphere surrounding the boojum) appears in the denominator reﬂecting the fact
that the magnetic ﬂux spread for one side (x3 < X) of the right boundary of the
domain wall at x3 = X. Thus magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld from the boojum with
˜MB = 4π is given by

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:126)˜B(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =

2

(x1)2 + (x2)2 + (x3 − X)2 .

(3.56)

We show the magnetic ﬂux ˜B3(ρ = 0, x3) on the x3 axis for ˜m = 20 in Fig. 10 and
ﬁnd that it asymptotically approaches to the Coulomb law as

˜B3(ρ = 0, x3) (cid:39)

−2

(x3 − 22.8)2 ,

(cid:0)x3 (cid:46) 20(cid:1) .

(3.57)

Thus, the boojum is identical to the magnetic point particle put on X = 22.8 with

the magnetic charge ˜MB = 4π, if it is observed suﬃciently far away. Since the
boundary of the inner layer at the vortex string side is about x3 ∼ 22, it is quite
natural that the above approximation works well.
Let us now leave the boojum and travel inside the domain wall along x1 − x2
plane. When we reach the distance much farther than the domain wall width ∼ 2 ˜m,
the magnetic ﬂux expands as if in 2-dimensional plane. Therefore, the magnetic ﬁeld
should behave as | ˜B| ∝ 1/ρ. Thus, one may expect for ρ (cid:29) 2 ˜m

˜Ba =

where 2πρ in the denominator is the circumference of an circle surrounding the
boojum. However, this is too naive. We should not forget that the inner layer
is not a 2 dimensional plane, but it has the thickness ˜dW = 2 ˜m. Therefore, the
magnetic ﬁeld lines are parallelly distributed along the x3 direction and, eﬀectively,
the magnetic charge is weakened by 1/2 ˜m. Thus, the correct asymptotic behavior of
the magnetic ﬁeld for ρ (cid:29) 2 ˜m should be

In order to verify this, we plot ˜B1(x1, 0, x3 = X0), where x3 = X0 is the center of the
domain wall for ˜m = 10, 20, 30 in Fig. 11. We read x3 = X0 at which σ becomes zero,
and ﬁnd X0 = 2.07, 2.26, 2.36 for ˜m = 10, 20, 30, respectively. As seen from Fig. 11,
the numerical solution perfectly supports the formula Eq. (3.59). Thus, when seen
at a distance, the boojum is suitable to be called magnetic monostick of height 2 ˜m.

˜MB/(2πx1) = 2/x1 for x1 > 2 ˜m.

3.3.2 Colinear Vortex strings from both sides

Let us next consider collinear vortex strings ending on the domain wall from both
sides. Since the tensions of the vortex strings are the same, the domain wall remains
ﬂat. For NF = 2 case with M = ( ˜m/2,− ˜m/2), such conﬁguration is given by the
moduli matrix H0 = (z, z). The collinear vortex strings sit on the x3 axis and the
ﬂat domain wall is at x3 = 0. The corresponding master equation is

Since ∂2

ρ + (1/ρ)∂ρ → 0 for a large ρ, the scalar function asymptotically obeys

u(ρ, x3) → uW (x3) + 2 log ρ,
where uW (x3) is the domain wall solution to ∂2
with uW → ± ˜mx3 for x3 → ±∞. For a large x3 ((cid:29) ˜m), ∂2
equation reduces to

(ρ (cid:29) 1) ,

3uW − 1 +(cid:16)e ˜mx3 + e− ˜mx3(cid:17) e−uW = 0

totic behaviors is just superposition of uW and uS

U (ρ, x3, t = 0) = uW (x3) + uS(ρ).

(3.67)

We show three typical conﬁgurations at weak gauge coupling with ˜m = 10, 20, 30
in Fig. 12. The solution is symmetric under the reﬂection through the x1-x2 plane.
Since the domain walls have quite wide inner layers of the Coulomb phase, the
upper and lower boojums are well isolated, see the panels in the middle column of
Fig. 12. Incoming magnetic ﬂuxes from the upper vortex string freely spread inside
the domain walls, and then they are swallowed by the lower vortex string. There
are no magnetic force lines going to inﬁnity along the domain walls (ρ = ∞) due
to the ﬂux conservation. The expanse of the magnetic ﬂux inside the domain wall
is of the same order as the width of the domain wall, as expected in Ref. [45]. We

Fig. 13. The right and left boundary of the inner layer are at x3 = ± ˜m. So the
boojums, fractional magnetic monopoles, are really stuck on the boundaries.

3.3.3 Semi-local Boojums, semi-local magnetic monostick

So far, we have mostly considered NF = 2 model which has three kind of topological
objects, the domain wall, the vortex string and the boojum.
In the models with
higher number of ﬂavors NF > 2, other kinds of topological object enters the game.
Namely, the semi-local vortex strings [72] and the semi-local boojums. They appear
when some of the masses are degenerate. The minimal model is NF = 3 with ˜M =
diag( ˜m/2, ˜m/2,− ˜m/2). The model has a non-Abelian ﬂavor symmetry SU (2)×U (1),
and two isolated vacua: the ﬁrst vacuum (cid:104)1(cid:105) is determined by | ˜H1|2 + | ˜H2|2 = 1,
˜H3 = 0 and ˜σ = ˜m/2, while the second vacuum (cid:104)2(cid:105) is determined by ˜H1 = ˜H2 = 0,
˜H3 = 1 and ˜σ = − ˜m/2. Thus, the vacuum manifold for (cid:104)1(cid:105) is CP 1, while that for
(cid:104)2(cid:105) is a point. The vortex string put in the degenerate vacuum (cid:104)1(cid:105) is the so-called
semi-local vortex string [72]. The semi-local vortex string can change its transverse
size with its tension preserved. Namely, it has a size moduli. To prevent confusion,
vortex string in the non-degenerate vacuum (cid:104)2(cid:105) is sometimes called the local vortex

string.

Here we consider 1/4 BPS conﬁguration of the semi-local vortex string ending
on the domain wall. Naturally, the boojum at the junction point changes its size
with the semi-local string, therefore we may call it semi-local Boojum. The simplest
conﬁguration is generated by the moduli matrix

H0 = (z, a, 1),

(3.70)

where a is a complex constant. We can assume that a is a positive real number
without loss of generality. This yields an axially symmetric conﬁguration with the

Repeating the similar analysis done in Sec. 3.2, we ﬁnd the following function as a
suitable initial function to the gradient ﬂow equation for Eq. (3.71)

which is just a replacement uS → uSLS in Eq. (3.36).

We show the numerical solutions with ˜m = 10 (in the weak coupling region)
and a = 5, 10, 20 in Fig. 14. This should be compared with the panels in the left
column of Fig. 9, which shows ˜m = 10 with a = 0 (the local vortex string and local
boojum). Increasing the size of the parameter a, the cross-section of the semi-local
vortex string grows linearly. At the same time, the semi-local boojum is inﬂated.
Fig. 14 clearly shows that the transverse size in the x1-x2 plane follows the semi-local
vortex string but the vertical size along the x3 axis is limited by the domain wall
size.

There is an advantage for making use of the moduli matrix formalism. As listed
at the beginning of Sec. 3, all the physical quantities are expressed by the single
scalar function u. Thanks to this, we can immediately conclude that the mass of the
semi-local boojum is the same as that of the local boojum, namely

˜TSLB = −8π ˜m, TSLB = −

2πm

This is because the change in the calculations in Eqs. (3.47) and (3.48) is that ρ is

replaced by (cid:112)ρ2 + a2, which does not aﬀect the result. Similarly, due to the ﬂux

conservation, the magnetic charge of the semi-local boojum is

˜MSLB = 4π, MSLB =

2π
g

.

(3.76)

Thus, the quantum numbers of the semi-local boojum are the same as those for the
local boojum. Where can we ﬁnd the eﬀect of the size moduli? It appears in the
Coulomb’s law. When the boojum is seen far from the string axis, the magnetic ﬁeld
should spread according to the 1 + 2 dimensional Coulomb’s law as in Eq. (3.59) for
the local boojum. In the semi-local case, we ﬁnd the following modiﬁed Coulomb’s

with b = 1, 2 and ˜dW = 2 ˜m. We compare it to the numerically obtained magnetic
ﬁeld for ˜m = 10 and a = 5, 20 in Fig. 15 by plotting ˜B1(x1, 0, x3 = X0) with
X0 = 2.07 (˜σ(x3 = X0) = 0 as before). We also show the magnetic ﬁeld with a = 0
(the ordinary Coulomb’s law). As clearly seen in Fig. 15, the modiﬁed Coulomb’s
law reproduces the numerical result much better than the normal Coulomb’s law.

If we extrapolate the magnetic ﬁeld in Eq. (3.77) to ρ = 0, it implies the following

Therefore, the semi-local boojum is not point-like. Roughly speaking, the magnetic
charge is distributed into a cylinder of the height 2 ˜m and the radius ρ = a. Thus, it
is suitable to call the semi-local boojum as semi-local magnetic monostick.

Finally, we show collinear semi-local vortex strings with diﬀerent sizes ending on
the domain wall. A minimal model for this is NF = 4 with ˜M = diag( ˜m

The domain wall is asymptotically ﬂat, but it can be logarithmically bent around the
junction point, when the sizes of two strings are very diﬀerent. Such local bending
is visible in the strong gauge coupling limit ˜m (cid:28) 1. In Fig. 16, we show two typical
conﬁgurations that have two collinear strings, the single local vortex string (a2 = 0)
from x3 < 0 side and the single very fat semillocal vortex string with a1 = 30 from
x3 > 0 side, ending of the domain wall for ˜m = 1/5 ( strong gauge coupling) and
˜m = 20 (weak gauge coupling). The domain wall steeply bends near the collinear
string axis for ˜m = 1/5, but it asymptotically becomes ﬂat at large ρ due to the
balance of the tensions of two vortex strings. On the other hand, the domain wall
tension becomes suﬃciently large for ˜m = 20, so that the local curving structure
near the string axis is almost invisible. The well-squeezed magnetic ﬂux tube from
the local vortex string is magniﬁed, when it goes into the semi-local vortex string as
is shown in the right panels of Fig. 16. This is a lens eﬀect for the magnetic force
lines.

˜m=15˜m=20˜TWm2v3.4 Strong coupling regime

Let us next consider the strong gauge coupling limit5 where the kinetic term of the
gauge ﬁeld disappears in the Lagrangian (2.1), and the Higgs ﬁelds are restricted to
satisfy HH† = v2. Because of this, the domain wall has no internal structure, namely
both inside and outside the domain wall are in the Higgs phase. The gauge ﬁelds are
inﬁnitely heavy and no longer dynamical. Indeed, their equations of motion give

Aµ = −i

2v2(cid:0)H∂µH†

− ∂µHH†(cid:1) .

(3.80)
As a result, the Abelian-Higgs model with NF ﬂavor reduces to the massive CP NF −1
nonlinear sigma model. One can introduce ﬁctitious electromagnetic ﬁelds by Fµν =
∂µAν − ∂νAν from the gauge ﬁelds given above as

The BPS equations and the energy formulae obtained in Sec. 2.2 remain un-
changed except for dropping the terms proportional to 1/g2. Furthermore, the mod-
uli matrix formalism explained in Sec. 2.3 still works without any changes. One
advantage is that the master equation is exactly solvable

In the following we will set η = ξ = +1. Let us take the simplest example of
a singular lump string (singular at a spacial inﬁnity) ending on the domain wall,
which is generated by the moduli matrix H0 = (z, 1) in NF = 2 model with M =

Similarly, the conﬁguration with one regular lump string of the size a end-
ing on the domain wall given by H0 = (z, a, 1) in NF = 3 model with M =

(m/2, m/2,−m/2) can be obtained by just replacing ρ → (cid:112)ρ2 + a2 in the above

results. Therefore, the a = 1, 2 components of the magnetic ﬂux at the domain wall
is given by

(3.87)

As observed in the previous subsections, the boojum, precisely speaking the ending
point of the vortex string on the domain wall, can be regarded as the magnetic
source inside the domain wall. In order to pursue the identiﬁcation, let us introduce
the magnetic scalar potential, whose gradient gives the a = 1, 2 component of the
magnetic ﬁelds:

Ba = −∂aϕ(xb),

(a = 1, 2).

(3.88)

In this subsection6 and we will concentrate on Ba=1,2 only, while ignoring the third
component B3.

3.5.1 Strong coupling limit

Let us ﬁrst consider the strong gauge coupling limit where the magnetic ﬁelds are
given as in Eq. (3.86). The magnetic scalar potential for this is given by

ϕ = −

qB
2π

log ρ,

qB = mπ.

(3.89)

Because of ∂2
thought of as a point magnetic source with the charge qB:

a(log ρ)/2π = δ(2)(xa), we see that the singular lump string can be

∂aBa = −∂2

aϕ = qBδ(2)(xa).

(3.90)

This identiﬁcation of the lump string to the point magnetic source is consistent with
the fact that the lump string is asymptotically singular far away from the domain
wall.

The magnetic charge qB = mπ can be understood as follows. The total magnetic
ﬂux coming from the lump string is 2π. Furthermore, as explained in Sec. 3.1.1, the
width of domain wall in the strong gauge coupling is given by dW = 2/m. Thus,
the mean value of the total magnetic ﬂux going through center of the domain wall
corresponds to the magnetic charge

2π
dW

= mπ = qB.

(3.91)

6In this subsection, we will use the original variables xµ, m and so on.

– 45 –

Now we come across an interesting coincidence: the domain wall curve given in
Eq. (3.84) and the magnetic scalar potential introduced in Eq. (3.89) are related as

ϕ =

m2
2

x3 =

mx3
dW

.

(3.92)

Multiplication of m2 is needed for consistency of the mass dimension. If we integrate
all the magnetic ﬂux going through the domain wall, we have the total magnetic
scalar potential

Φ = dW ϕ = mx3.

(3.93)

This coincidence tells us that the wall curve function x3(ρ) gives the magnetic scalar
potential.

This is quite similar to another identiﬁcation of an end point of the singular
lump string on the domain wall in the massive CP 1 nonlinear sigma model to an
electric point source of a dual electromagnetic ﬁeld on the 2 + 1 dimensional domain
wall world volume theory [11], as will be studied in Sec. 9. In this section, however,
we do not take the dual viewpoint and we deal with the magnetic ﬁeld of the original
U (1) gauge ﬁeld.

The end point of the ﬁnite size lump string on the domain wall can be similarly
regarded as a magnetic source, but as a source with ﬁnite size magnetic density. The
magnetic scalar potential leading to Eq. (3.87) is given by

ϕ = −

qB
4π

log(ρ2 + a2),

(3.94)

As in the case of the singular lump string, the same relation (3.92) between the
magnetic scalar potential and the wall curve function holds.

3.5.2 Weak coupling regime

Let us next consider the ﬁnite gauge coupling limit in which the vortex string has
the ﬁnite size of order 1/gv. The boojum also has ﬁnite size, so that it should be
identiﬁed with a magnetic source with ﬁnite size distribution in 2 + 1 dimensions. In
the ﬁnite gauge coupling, the domain wall’s position is given by Eq. (3.38). In terms
of the original variables, it is rewritten as

x3(ρ) = −

1
2m

uS(ρ).

(3.95)

Now we identify this wall curve function with the magnetic scalar potential by
Eq. (3.92). Before doing this, let us remember that the width of the domain wall in
the weak gauge coupling region is dW = m/g2v2. Thus the magnetic scalar potential
in the weak gauge coupling region is given by

ϕ =

mx3
dW

g2v2

uS.

string) with the size moduli a = 1 in the right panel for the strong gauge coupling
limit (red) and the ﬁnite gauge coupling (blue). The horizontal axes is in the unit of
1/√2gv.

Since uS is asymptotically log ρ2, we read the magnetic charge as

qB =

m

.

(3.97)

This is consistent with the observation in the strong gauge coupling limit given in
Eq. (3.91).

Let us verify if the magnetic scalar potential correctly reproduces the numerical
results explained in Sec. 3.3.1. The corresponding magnetic ﬁeld obtained from the
magnetic scalar potential (3.96) is

Ba =

to the magnetic ﬁeld made by the vortex string.

Again, this perfectly agrees with the previous result given in Eq. (3.77).

We plot the magnetic scalar potentials in Fig. 17 for the strong gauge coupling
limit and the ﬁnite gauge coupling case. In the left panel, the red curve shows that
the potential made by the point magnetic source at the origin which corresponds to
the end point of the singular lump string in the strong gauge coupling limit. When
the gauge coupling is ﬁnite, the string size becomes ﬁnite of order 1/gv, and the
charge distribution get fat with the same size. Then the magnetic potential written
in the blue curve in the left panel becomes regular at the origin. In the right panel, we
show the similar potentials for the semi-local conﬁgurations with the moduli matrix
H0 = (z, a, 1) with the mass matrix M = (m/2, m/2,−m/2). We set a = 1 so that
the semi-local strings are non singular even in the strong gauge coupling limit.

The magnetic scalar potential can be explained in diﬀerent way at more technical
level as follows. As are given in Eq. (2.26), the BPS equations and the moduli matrix
formalism give us

Ba = ∂a(cid:18)1

2

∂3u(cid:19) ,

(3.103)

where u is a solution to the master equation for the full 1/4 BPS equations. Therefore,
we should extract the magnetic scalar potential ϕ from ∂3u/2. How can we do it? A
hint is in the approximate solution

Let us evaluate ∂a∂3U on the domain wall’s position x3 = −uS/2m. We ﬁnd

(3.105)

where the prime stands for a x3 derivative. From Eq. (2.26), we have σ = ∂3uW /2,
so that u(cid:48)(cid:48)
W (0)/2 corresponds to σ(cid:48)(0), namely the derivative of σ at the center of the

domain wall. As is shown in Fig. 1, σ transits from −m/2 to m/2 inside the domain
wall of the thickness dW . Thus, we have u(cid:48)(cid:48)
W (0)/2 = σ(cid:48)(0) = m/dW . Combining all
the pieces, we reach the desired result

4. Non-axially symmetric solutions

In the previous section we have concentrated on studying the 1/4 BPS states which
are all axially symmetric about the vortex-string axis. This symmetry reduces the
problem from being three-dimensional to two-dimensional. Contrary to this, in this
section we will show many numerical solutions, which require full three-dimensional
treatment. We can again use the moduli matrix formalism introduced in Sec. (2.3)
to reduce the 1/4 BPS equations (2.16)–(2.19) to the master equation (2.25) for a
single scalar function u(xk).

4.1 NF = 2
Let us ﬁrst look at the 1/4 BPS solutions in NF = 2 case with ˜M = ( ˜m/2,− ˜m/2),
which has two distinct vacua (cid:104)1(cid:105) and (cid:104)2(cid:105), and one domain wall separating those
vacua. The moduli matrix for n1 (n2) vortex strings in the vacuum (cid:104)1(cid:105) ((cid:104)2(cid:105)) is given
by

H0 = (Pn1(z), Pn2(z)),

(4.1)

where Pn(z) stands for an arbitrary polynomial of n-th power in z. For this moduli
matrix, we solve the master equation (3.14) written in terms of the dimensionless
parameters (3.1). As before, we upgrade the master equation to the gradient ﬂow
(3.18) for the real scalar function U (xk, t),

We need an appropriate initial function for solving this. It is given by

∂2

kU − 1 +(cid:16)|Pn1|2e ˜mx3 + |Pn2|2e− ˜mx3(cid:17) e−U = ∂tU.
U(xk) = uW(cid:32)x3 +

where uW (x3) is the domain wall solution to the master equation (3.15) and u(n)
S (x1, x2)
is the n vortex string solution to the master equation (3.17). One can easily check
that this correctly reproduces the initial functions given in Sec. 3 for n1,2 = 0 or 1.
Two vortex strings in the ﬁrst vacuum (cid:104)1(cid:105) ending on the domain wall can be

generated by

Pn1=2(z) = (z − L)(z + L), Pn2=0(z) = 1.

(4.4)

The vortex strings are asymptotically parallel and located at z = ±L. In Fig. 18 we
show a numerical solution with L = 6 for ˜m = 1. The gray surfaces in the panels
(a1) and (a2) on Fig. 18 are the energy density isosurfaces on which ˜TW + ˜TS + ˜TB

takes one half of its maximum.

and the total energy density (b4) with the distance between two vortices L = 6. The
mass is set to be ˜m = 1.

ending on the domain wall in NF = 2 model with ˜m = 1. The separation of two
strings are L = 6, 4, 2, 0. The horizontal axes are x1 and x2.

The red lumps in the panels (a1) and (a2) of Fig. 18 show the boojum density

isosurface on which ˜TB takes one half of its minimum (a negative value), and the

red and blue curves correspond to the magnetic force lines going through the vortex
strings. In the panels (b1), (b2), and (b3) we show the topological charge densities

˜TW , ˜TS, and ˜TB on the cross section which passes the centers of vortex strings,
respectively. The panel (b4) of Fig. 18 depicts the total energy density ˜T including

the surface terms on the same cross section.

One can easily change the distance of two vortex strings by varying L in Eq. (4.4).
The numerical solutions for L = 4, 2, 0 are shown in Fig. 19. It is clearly seen that
the two individual boojums coalesce into one large boojum as the distance between
two vortex strings becomes small.

Looking at the magnetic force lines injecting inside the domain wall via the
vortex strings shown in the panels (a1) of Figs. 18 and 19, the red and blue lines
repel on the domain wall. This is quite similar to expansion of the magnetic force
lines from two point-like magnetic sources in 2 + 1 dimensions. As is seen for the

– 53 –

L=6L=4L=2L=0single magnetic source in Sec. 3.5, we indeed regard them as the 2 + 1 dimensional
magnetic sources and the corresponding magnetic scalar potential is given by the
domain wall curve function. It can be read from Eq. (4.3) as

(4.5)

with ˜dW (cid:39) 2 for ˜m = 1. We show the numerical plots for the magnetic scalar poten-
tials in Fig. 20. They are asymptotically close to the log function ˜ϕ → −(log ρ4)/4
for large ρ. Note that the solution u(n1=2)
is well approximated by a superposition
of u(n1=1)

when the separation L is suﬃciently large:

S

(cid:12)(cid:12)Pn1 =z+L,

S

with u(n1=1)
shown in Fig. 2. When L is comparable to the size of the vortex string,
the superposition is no longer good approximation and we should solve the master
equation directly as the numerical solutions shown in Fig. 20.

Let us next consider the asymptotically ﬂat domain wall on which a vortex strings

end from both sides. The moduli matrix is

Pn1=1(z) = z − L, Pn2=1(z) = z + L.

(4.7)

The parameters z = ±L correspond to positions of the string end points. We show
a typical solution with L = 6 for ˜m = 1 case in Fig. 21. The six panels in Fig. 21
show the same quantities plotted in the panels in Fig. 18. The magnetic force lines
incoming from the vortex string on the positive x3 side go into the other vortex string
on the negative x3 side. Seen from the x3 axis, the distribution of the magnetic force
lines is like a magnetic dipole, see the panel (a2) of Fig. 21. This is remarkable
contrast to the two vortex strings ending on the domain wall from one side. The
former can be thought of as the dipole with opposite magnetic charges and the latter
is as the dipole with the same magnetic charges. As we reduce the separation L of the
two strings, the region in which the magnetic ﬂux expands gets smaller, see Fig. 22
where we plot the numerical solutions for L = 4, 2, 0. Note that when L = 0 the two
vortex strings become collinear and the magnetic charges in the 2 + 1 dimensional
sense exactly cancel. Even in the limit L → 0, the boojums do not disappear because
the domain wall has the ﬁnite width and the boojums are separate in x3 direction.

vortices L = 6.

Now we expect that the end point of the vortex string on the positive (negative)
x3 side should be identiﬁed with the positive (negative) point-like magnetic source.
The corresponding magnetic scalar potential is again given by the domain wall curve
function, which we read from Eq. (4.3) as

the potentials of the positive and negative sources. Unlike the case of two charges of
the same kind, the potential is given by the superposition irrespective the value of
L.

Let us make a comment on the shapes of the boojums. When they are well
separated, shape of the individual boojum is approximately the same as that drawn
in the right panel of Fig. 4. When the vortex strings are closer to each other than

the vortex string size, the boojums merge. One may recall that rich 3D structure
appears when several BPS ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopoles in SU (2) gauge theory get
close. For the boojums in the Abelian-Higgs theory, such drastic change in the shape
is not observed, see Figs. 24 and 25.

Our last comment here is about the question of deﬁnition of the binding energy
raised in [66]. Consider two vortex-strings attached to the domain wall from both
sides, see Fig. 26. Two vortex-strings are separated by the distance d. For this
conﬁguration the authors of Ref. [66] argued that there are two possibilities where the
binding energy is located. First possibility is that the binding energy only localizes
around the junction points. Second one is that it localizes not only around the
junction points but also near the origin (dotted-circled domain in the right ﬁgure in
Fig. 26). Our numerical solutions, for example Fig. 21, strongly supports that the
former is true.

4.2 NF ≥ 3
4.2.1 Non-degenerate masses

Next we will explain how to obtain the 1/4 BPS conﬁgurations with two domain walls
separating three diﬀerent vacua (cid:104)A(cid:105) (A = 1, 2, 3) in which nA vortex strings exist.
The minimal model is NF = 3 with non-degenerate mass matrix ˜M = ( ˜m1/2, ( ˜m2 −
˜m1)/2,− ˜m2/2). The tension of the domain wall interpolating (cid:104)1(cid:105) and (cid:104)2(cid:105) is v2(2 ˜m1−
˜m2)/2 and that of the domain wall interpolating (cid:104)2(cid:105) and (cid:104)3(cid:105) is v2(2 ˜m2 − ˜m1)/2. For
simplicity, we will focus on the case ˜m1 = ˜m2 = ˜m, namely that the two domain
walls have the same tension.

First of all, let us consider the conﬁguration with no vortex strings. The moduli

matrix is characterized by only one real parameter δ as

H0 = (1, δ, 1).

(4.9)

When δ (cid:29) 1 the physical meaning of this parameter is related to the separation of
walls, since the position of the walls can be estimated as

Thus the separation R is

see Fig. 27. When δ is close to or smaller than 1, two domain walls coalesce and
2(log δ2)/ ˜m can no longer be understood as the distance. When δ → −∞, the

u = uW (x3; δ) which satisﬁes the following reduced master equation

3uW (x3; δ) − 1 +(cid:16)e ˜mx3 + δ2 + e− ˜mx3(cid:17) e−uW (x3;δ) = 0.

(4.12)

Next, we put nA vortex strings in the (cid:104)A(cid:105) vacuum. The moduli matrix for this

is given by

H0 = (Pn1(z), δPn2(z), Pn3(z)),

(4.13)

where PnA(z) stands for a monomial of nA-th degree. The corresponding gradient
ﬂow equation is

The domain walls are asymptotically parallel when 2n2 = n1 + n3 and are asymptot-
ically ﬂat only when n1 = n2 = n3.

In Fig. 28, we show the numerical solution for n1 = n3 = 0 and n2 = 1 with
δ = e5 for the model with ˜m = 2. Namely, we put a single vortex string in the
middle vacuum (cid:104)2(cid:105). Reasons for taking ˜m = 2 here is, ﬁrst, that the mass of each
domain wall is ˜m/2 = 1, and, second, that we have the exact solution uW to the
domain wall master equation in this case [73]. Having the exact solution beneﬁts
our numerical works. We will mention more about this in Sec. 7. The panel (b2)
of Fig. 28 clearly shows that the vortex string of the ﬁnite length (cid:96) = 2
˜m log δ2 (cid:39) 10
exists in the middle vacuum. The string length (cid:96) is the same as the domain wall
distance with no vortex strings. The magnetic ﬂuxes expressed by the blue curve in
the panels (a1) and (a2) in the domain wall at the negative side of x3 are squeezed
and run through the vortex string, and then expand inside the domain wall at the
positive side of x3. The end points of the vortex strings on the domain walls are
accompanied with the boojums as shown in the panel (b3).

As δ gets small, the domain walls get close. At the same time, the distance
between the boojums becomes smaller and the vortex string gets shorter. We show
the solutions for δ = e4,2,0 in Fig. 29. When the domain walls start to merge it is
diﬃcult to ﬁnd a clear boundary between them. In this situation it is diﬃcult to
speak about the length of the string. However, the diameter of the string becomes
very wide, while the magnitude of the magnetic ﬂux weakens, see Fig. 30 for δ = e−2.
The panels (b2) and (b3) in Fig. 30 show the vortex and boojum charges and we see
that the vortex is indeed sandwiched by the domain walls. Ultimately, at δ = 0, the
middle vacuum completely disappears, so that the vortex vanishes as well. Fig. 31
shows change of the shape of two boojums living in the diﬀerent domain walls. As
the domain walls close on each other, the boojums merge into a ﬂat disk.

The number of the vortices are 3, 2 and 1 in the vacua (cid:104)1(cid:105), (cid:104)2(cid:105) and (cid:104)3(cid:105), respectively.

Observing the expansion of the magnetic ﬂux in the two domain walls shown
in Figs. 28 and 29, it is natural to regard the vortex string as a magnetic source as
before. Clearly, the vortex string should be regarded as a positive magnetic source
for one of the domain wall (on the x3 positive side) and as a negative magnetic source
for the other (on the x3 negative side). The corresponding magnetic scalar potentials
for 2 + 1 dimensional worlds inside the domain walls are given by x3 positions of the
domain walls. From Eqs. (4.17) and (4.18), we have

Here we have put ˜m/2 instead of ˜m on the numerators of the middle equations, since
the mass diﬀerence of the ﬁrst (second) and second (third) ﬂavor is ˜m/2. Corre-

spondingly, the domain wall thickness is given by ˜dW (cid:39) 2( ˜m/2) = 2 for ˜m = 2.

Except for the unphysical constant parts, these two potentials are equal but have
diﬀerent signs. This is consistent with our interpretation of the vortex string as the
magnetic sources to the domain walls. The magnetic potential is shown in the left
panel of Fig. 17.

As an example for more complicated conﬁguration, in Fig. 32, we show the
solution which have single, double and triple vortex strings in the vacuum (cid:104)1(cid:105), (cid:104)2(cid:105)

and (cid:104)3(cid:105), respectively. The number of vortex strings satisfy the relation 2n2 = n1 +n3,
so that the domain walls are logarithmically bending but are asymptotically parallel.

4.2.2 Partially degenerate masses

When some masses are partially degenerate, the corresponding vacua are degener-
ate. Then the vortex strings there become the semi-local vortex strings, as seen
in Sec. 3.3.3. As before, we consider the minimal model NF = 3 with ˜M =
diag( ˜m/2, ˜m/2,− ˜m/2). The relevant moduli matrix is given by

H0 = (Pn1(z), Qn1−1(z), Pn2(z)),

(4.22)

where Pn(z) is a monomial of power n and Qn(z) stands for a polynomial of power
n. The n1 semi-local vortex strings in the degenerate vacuum (cid:104)1(cid:105) are determined by
Pn1 and Qn1−1, while the n2 local vortex strings in the vacuum (cid:104)2(cid:105) are determined
by Pn2.

The gradient ﬂow equation to be solved is

∂2

kU − 1 +(cid:16)(|Pn1|2 + |Qn1−1|2)e ˜mx3 + |Pn2|2e− ˜mx3(cid:17) e−U = ∂tU.

(4.23)

This is identical to Eq. (4.2) if we replace |Pn1|2 → |Pn1|2 +|Qn1−1|2. Thus, a suitable
initial conﬁguration is given by

that we can have any kind of numerical conﬁgurations, see Fig. 35.

5. A magnetic capacitor

In this section we will study the 1/4 BPS solutions which have a lot of vortex strings
aligned in a line on one end of the domain wall in the model with NF = 2 and
M = ( ˜m/2,− ˜m/2). The details for solving the master equation have been already
explained in Sec. 4.1. The moduli matrix which we will consider in this section is
given in Eq. (4.1).

5.1 Linearly aligned vortex strings ending on a domain wall from one side
First, we align n1 vortex strings in the vacuum (cid:104)1(cid:105) on a line, while we set no vortex
strings in the opposite vacuum (cid:104)2(cid:105). We will consider the following moduli matrix
given in Eq. (4.1) with

Pn1(z) = e− ˜mX/2

(n1−1)/2(cid:89)k=−(n1−1)/2

(z − Lk), Pn2=0(z) = e ˜mX/2,

(5.1)

with L and X begin real constants. For this moduli matrix, the n1 string axes in the
vacuum (cid:104)1(cid:105) are alined on the x1 axis with the separation L. The other real parameter
X is introduced to shift the conﬁguration along the x3 direction.
In Fig. 36, we show two examples for n1 = 7 and n1 = 15. We set X = 20
for n1 = 7 and X = 40 for n1 = 15, and L = 3 for both solutions. Since the
vortex strings are degenerate if they are seen very far from the junction points,
the asymptotic bending of the domain wall is logarithmic ∼ log ρ2n1. However, the
structure near the junction points is not logarithmic. The panels (b1) of Fig. 36
show the domain wall energy density on the cross-section at x1 = 0. Increasing the
number of aligned vortex strings, the domain wall at the vicinity of junction points
becomes locally ﬂat. Area of the ﬂat region increases if we put more and more vortex
strings on the line.

Emergence of the ﬂat part can be understood as follows. As before, the domain

wall’s position can be read from the master equation as

x3(x1, x2) = −

Suppose that we have the inﬁnite point-like magnetic sources on a line, say the
x1 axis, with the period L. Due to the symmetry of this source arrangement, the
magnetic force lines far from the x1 axis become parallel to the x2 axis. There is
one magnetic source of the magnetic charge ˜qB = 2π/ ˜dW (see the discussions in in
Sec. 3.5) at every ﬁnite segment x1 ∈ [x0, x0 + L] for an arbitrary x0. Therefore,
seen far from the sources, the magnetic charge density is ˜qB/L. The magnetic force
lines from these source equally expand both to x2 > 0 and x2 < 0 regions. Thus, we

Figure 39: The magnetic scalar potentials for the periodically aligned vortex strings
with periods 2π (η = 1/2) and π (η = 1).

Combining this with Eq. (5.9), we correctly ﬁnd the asymptotic behavior given in
Eq. (5.8).

In order to get vortex strings periodically aligned on a line, it is better to use
holomorphic trigonometric functions rather than polynomial functions [52]. For ex-
ample, we choose the following moduli matrix

H0 = (sin iηz, 1) .

(5.11)

The positions of the vortex strings correspond to the zeros of the ﬁrst elements,

namely z = (πi/η)n (n ∈ Z). An advantage of using the trigonometric function is

that one does not need to shift the domain wall’s position by adjusting the X pa-
rameter for the polynomial case in Eq. (5.1). In Fig. 38, we show two examples with
sparsely aligned (η = 1/2: the period is 2π) and densely alined (η = 1: the period
π) vortex strings ending on the domain wall from one side. Since the moduli matrix
includes the inﬁnite number of vortex strings, the domain wall becomes asymptot-
ically exactly ﬂat with the slanting angle η. Namely, the domain wall’s position is

⌘=1⌘=1/25.2 Linearly aligned vortex strings ending on a domain wall from two sides

Let us next consider conﬁgurations with periodically aligned inﬁnite vortex strings
ending on the domain wall from both sides. The corresponding moduli matrix is
given by

H0 = (sin iη1(z − Z1), sin iη2(z − Z2)) ,

(5.13)

with Z1,2 being complex constants. We set η1 = η2 = η to be real constants, so that
the vortex strings are aligned on the lines x1 = Re(Z1,2) parallel to the x2 axis with
period π/η. We show two examples of this kind in Figs. 40 and 41 with ˜m = 1. In the
former ﬁgure, we take Z1 = −Z2 = 10, 5, 0 with η = 1/2 (the period is 2π). In the
latter ﬁgure, we shift the vortex strings at the negative x3 side by δx2 = π. Namely,
we take Z1 = −Z2 + iπ = 10, 5, 0. Far from the vortex strings the domain wall is
ﬂat and perpendicular to the x1 − x2 plane. On the other hand, between the vortex
strings the domain wall is ﬂat but slanted as x3 (cid:39) 2ηx1, which is twice steeper than
for the domain wall with the vortex strings just on the one side, see Eq. (5.12). This
is, of course, because we have two lines of vortex strings. The shape of the domain
wall is determined by superposition, as was discussed in Eq. (4.8). For example, the
domain wall’s position can be estimated for real positive Z > 0 as follows,

˜mx3 (cid:39) −η|x1 − Z| + η|x1 + Z| =

2ηZ
2ηx1
−2ηZ

2Z < x1

for −2Z < x1 < 2Z

x1 < −2Z

.

(5.14)

Comparing Figs. 40 and 41 we can see that the shift δx2 = π in Fig. 41 did not
aﬀect the resulting conﬁguration very much. Only the local structure around the
end points received small deformation but the asymptotic structure is not changed.
The formula (5.14) also remains correct.

Let us interpret the above 1/4 BPS conﬁgurations from the view point of 2 + 1

dimensions. The corresponding magnetic scalar potential is given as follows

structure of the kinky domain wall.

The last expression in Eq. (5.15) is reminiscent of the electric scalar potential for
an electric capacitor. Hence, we may call the conﬁguration with the magnetic scalar
potential given in Eq. (5.15) a magnetic capacitor in 2 + 1 dimensions. Let us deﬁne
a density of magnetic capacitance ˜cM by

˜cM δ ˜VB =

˜QB

(5.16)

where δ ˜VB = ˜dW ˜ϕ(cid:12)(cid:12)x2=Z− ˜dW ˜ϕ(cid:12)(cid:12)x2=Z stands for the diﬀerence of the magnetic potential

˜dW is the magnetic charge per unit length. We have δ ˜ϕ = 4ηZ/ ˜dW and
and ˜QB = ˜qB
˜qB = 2π/ ˜dW , thus we conclude that the domain wall has the magnetic capacitance

˜cM =

1
2Z

.

(5.17)

As an ordinary electric capacitance of a ﬂat capacitor, the capacitance is inversely
proportional to the distance of the charges.

This can be accounted by the following geometric consideration about the domain
wall and the vortex strings. Suppose the domain wall did not bend by the vortex
strings. Then the energy for the part between two linearly alined vortex strings,
namely x1 ∈ [−Z, Z] are proportional to the distance 2Z as is depicted in the left

panel of Fig. 43. In reality, of course, the domain wall linearly bends as is shown in
the right panel of Fig. 43. The bent domain wall is longer than ﬂat one by

δ ˜L = 2Z(cid:112)1 + 4η2 − 2Z (cid:39) 4η2Z,

for η (cid:28) 1. This coincides with the energy stored in the magnetic capacitor given in
Eq. (5.18).

5.3 Vortex strings ending on a slanting domain wall

Next, we consider the following moduli matrix which is slightly diﬀerent from the
one given in Eq. (5.13)

V (z) [31, 30, 34]. The V -transformation does not change any physics. Since we just
shifted the vortex strings to the spacial inﬁnities, the domain wall shape is given by
the Eq. (5.14) with replacement Z by Z + ξ/η. Especially, the domain wall between
the lines of the vortex strings keeps being slant with the same angle, see Fig. 44.
This holds even in the limit ξ → ∞. Furthermore, we know the existence of the
vortex strings behind the spacial boundaries x1 = ±∞, which provides a background
magnetic ﬂuxes 4π/(π/η) = 2η per unit length. In short, the ﬂat domain wall slants
when a background magnetic ﬁeld is turned on [30]. The 1/4 BPS master equation
for the moduli matrix (5.21) is given by

We show a numerical solution for ˜m = 1 and η = 1/4 in Fig. 45 which clearly demon-
strates the vortex string parallel to the x3 axis ends on the slanting and logarith-
mically bending domain wall. The junction point is accompanied with the boojum
which is also sheared as shown in the panel (b3) of Fig. 45. Interestingly, the mag-
netic force lines supplied by the vortex string do not spread out in the domain wall
but ﬂow toward a direction as forming a stringy ﬂux in 2 + 1 dimensions, see the
panel (a1) and (a2) in Fig. 45. This squeezing of the magnetic ﬂux inside the domain
wall occurs because the magnetic force lines from the vortex string repel with those
of the background magnetic ﬂux on the slanting domain wall.

so that they are squeezed. This situation is quite similar to the squeezing of the
magnetic ﬂuxes by the Higgs mechanism but it is not the case because no further
symmetries are broken in the domain wall.

Finally, we put another vortex string from the other side of the domain wall.

The moduli matrix is

H0 =(cid:0)(z − Z)eηz, −(z + Z)e−ηz(cid:1) .

We show several numerical solutions in Figs. 47 and 48 for ˜m = 1 and η = 1/4. We

those given in Figs. 21 and 22 which show the solutions of the ﬂat and non-slanting
domain wall with vortex strings from both sides. A remarkable diﬀerence between
non-slant and slant conﬁgurations can be found in distribution of the magnetic force
lines inside the domain wall. The ﬂux lines are quite similar to those around an
ordinary magnetic dipole in the non-slanting domain wall, see Fig. 22. On the other
hand, they are squeezed in the slanting domain wall, so if we arrange the vortex
strings in such a way that the line segment connecting two end points is exactly
parallel to the steepest direction of the slanting domain wall (the injecting vortex

Dyonic extension

6.1 Basic formulae

In this section we will study a dyonic extension of the purely magnetic 1/4 BPS
equations (2.16)–(2.19) [69, 74]. A perfect square of the energy density including
time dependence is given by

where we restrict α to satisfy α ∈ (−π/2, π/2) because cos α always appears accom-
panied with η = ±1. The non-topological currents ja=1,2 are the same as in (2.12)
while jk=3 is given by

j3 = −η cos α (σH − HM ) H†.

(6.2)

Vanishing of the squared terms leads to the dyonic extension to 1/4 BPS equations

D0H + i sin α(cid:0)σH − HM(cid:1) = 0 ,
D3H + η cos α(cid:0)σH − HM(cid:1) = 0 ,

(D1 + iξD2)H = 0 ,

which is obtained from (2.7). The parameters η2 = ξ2 = 1 labels (anti-)vortices ξ =
(−1)1 and (anti-)walls η = (−1)1. In the strong gauge coupling limit, our Abelian-
Higgs model reduces to the massive nonlinear sigma model whose target space is
CP NF −1, and the above dyonic extension reduces to the Q-kink lump conﬁguration
without the boojums, ﬁrst studied in Ref. [11].

When the BPS equations (6.3)–(6.9) and the Gauss’s law are satisﬁed, the total

energy density saturates the Bogomol’nyi bound

E ≥ (TW cos α + QW sin α) + TS + (TB cos α + QB sin α) + ∂kjk,

(6.11)

where TW,S,B is deﬁned in Eq. (2.15), and the Noether charge density and the electric
Boojum charge density are deﬁned by

(6.24)

Comparing this with the master equation (2.25) for the purely magnetic case, the
only diﬀerence is the replacement M by M cos α.

The tension of the domain wall is the same as in the purely magnetic case

TW =(cid:90) dx3 TW = ηv2(cid:2)σ(cid:3)x3=∞

x3=−∞ = v2η∆m = v2|∆m|.

(6.25)

The similar holds for the Noether charge. Combining Eqs. (6.3) and (6.4), we ﬁnd

D0H = iη tan α D3H.

By using this, we have the following expression for QW ,

QW = η tan α ∂3(cid:0)HM H†(cid:1) .
QW =(cid:90) dx3 QW = η tan α(cid:20)HM H†(cid:21)x3=∞

x3=−∞

Thus, the Noether charge density upon the integration over x3 gives a constant.

= v2∆mη tan α.

(6.28)

Hence, the Noether charge per unit area is proportional to the domain wall tension

QW
TW

= tan α.

(6.29)

Therefore, the volume integral of QW diverges as the domain wall mass which is

proportional to A =(cid:82) dx1dx2. Now, a part of the BPS mass can be calculated as

(cid:90) d3x (TW cos α + QW sin α) =

Contribution of the vortex string to the total mass is independent of cos α. Therefore,
we have TS = 2πv2|k| where k stands for the vortex winding number, and then the
mass of the vortex string is given by

(cid:90) d3x TS =(cid:90) dx3 TS = 2πv2|k|L.

Let us next evaluate TB, the boojum mass,

TB =

ηξ

g2(cid:90) d3x ∂i (σBi) .

(6.31)

(6.32)

This is easy to do for the case of ﬂat domain walls since we have the same number
k of straight vortex strings at both sides of the domain walls. The magnetic ﬂux at

x3 → ±∞ is given by(cid:82) dx1dx2 ξBi = −δi32π|k|. Therefore, we have

TB =

η

g2 × (−2π|k|) ×(cid:2)σ(cid:3)x3=+∞

x3=−∞ = −

2π
g2 |∆m||k|.

(6.33)

This is independent of α as TS. For conﬁgurations including bent domain walls, we
should repeat the same computation as we have done in Sec. 3.2. But it is clear even
for such cases that TB is independent of α. Hence, the formula Eq. (6.33) is valid for
any conﬁgurations. Contribution of the boojum to the total mass is then found as

cos α TB =

TB.

(6.34)

TW(cid:112)T 2

W + Q2

Since TB is negative deﬁnite, this makes the total mass larger. Next, we evaluate
contribution from QB given in Eq. (6.13). Using the BPS equations, it can be written
as

QB = ∂k(cid:18) σ

g2 F0k(cid:19) =

sin α
g2 ∂k (σ∂kσ) =

kσ2.

(6.35)

Since the electric ﬁeld is proportional to the derivative of σ, Ek ∝ ∂kσ, it is non-
zero only inside the domain wall. Therefore, upon integration along x3, QB vanishes.
The contribution from the non-topological terms ∂kjk also vanishes upon integration.
Summing up all the contributions, we conclude that the mass of the dyonic 1/4 BPS
conﬁguration is given by

(6.37)

– 90 –

This is very similar to QW . Since we have HH† = v2 at any vacua,(cid:82) dx3 QE = 0,

so that net electric charge is zero. However, note that the electric charge density is
non-zero everywhere.

implies that Ek is perpendicular to Bk far from the boojums, while in their vicinity
they are not.

6.2 The dyonic domain wall as an electric capacitor

The Q-extension of the domain wall was ﬁrst found in nonlinear sigma models in
Ref. [70, 71], and lots of works have followed them. The Q-extended domain walls in
gauge theories are sometimes called the dyonic domain walls [69, 74, 35]. They are
characterized by the topological and the Noether charges, so it is suitable to call them
dyonic solitons. In the previous works [69, 74, 35], the dyonic domain wall was not
a main focus. Some qualitative properties such as derivation of the BPS equations,
topological charges, and the BPS mass formula have been given. To the best of our
knowledge, very little has been done for solving the BPS equations, especially in the
weak gauge coupling region. Furthermore, while the Noether charge, which gives a
ﬁnite contribution to the BPS mass, has been studied very well, the electric and/or
magnetic charge densities have not been discussed. Therefore, before studying the
dyonic 1/4 BPS states, we stop for a while to clarify the dyonic domain wall in the
weak gauge coupling region.

The master equation for the dyonic domain wall in the dimensionless coordinates

(3.1) is given by

∂2

3u − 1 + Ω0e−u = 0, Ω0 = H

†
†
0e2η ˜M cos α x3H
0.

(6.39)

This is formally the same equation as the master equation for the purely magnetic
domain wall. If we write ˜M = ˜M(cid:48)/ cos α, the solutions u(x3) are identical to those
which have already obtained in Sec. 3.1.1. In order to avoid inessential complications,
we will consider η = +1 and ˜M(cid:48) = diag( ˜m(cid:48)/2, − ˜m(cid:48)/2) with ˜m(cid:48) > 0 in what follows.
Thus, we reuse the solutions given in Fig. 1 under the understanding that the yellow
line corresponds to 2 cos α ˜σ/ ˜m(cid:48). On the other hand, the proﬁle functions (the red
and blue lines in Fig. 1) of ˜H1,2 are unchanged. The tension of the domain wall
becomes

because of ˜m = ˜m(cid:48)/ cos α.

Since u = u(x3) and from Eq. (6.20), no magnetic ﬁelds are involved. On the

other hand, the third component of the electric ﬁeld does appears

˜E3 = 2 tan α ∂3˜σ = tan α ∂2

3u.

(6.41)

Remember, ∂3 means the derivative in terms of ˜x3 and ˜Ek = Ek/g2v2. When NF = 2,
as can be seen from Fig. 1, ˜σ is constant outside the domain wall, so no electric ﬁelds
exist there. On the other hand, a constant electric E3 appears inside the domain
wall, as ˜σ is linear in x3 there. Since the width of the domain wall is 2 ˜m(cid:48) and ˜σ
changes from − ˜m(cid:48)/2 cos α to ˜m(cid:48)/2 cos α, we have ∂3˜σ (cid:39) 1/2 cos α. Therefore, the

electric ﬁeld inside the domain wall for the weak coupling is

˜Ek =

sin α
cos2 α

δk3.

(6.42)

The induced electric charges which generate this electric ﬁelds can be found from
Eq. (6.37). In terms of the dimensionless coordinates, the electric charge density is
rewritten as follows

electric charges are induced on the outer layers, see Fig. 50: positive (negative)
electric charges on the left outer skin and negative (positive) charges on the right
outer skin for tan α > 0 (tan α < 0). Then the electric charge per unit area is given
by

Note that the dyonic domain wall behaves as the electric capacitor only in the

strong gauge coupling region, so that no electric charge can be stored on the outer
skins, see Eq. (6.43).

6.3 1/4 BPS dyonic conﬁgurations

Let us next consider the simplest 1/4 BPS dyonic solution H0 = (z, 1) in the NF = 2
case. As mentioned below Eq. (6.24), the diﬀerence between the master equation
for the purely magnetic and the dyonic cases amounts to the replacement of M by
M cos α. Therefore, as in the case of dyonic domain walls, all the numerical solu-
tions which we have obtained previously are still valid for the dyonic conﬁgurations.
Indeed, the master equation (6.24) in terms of the dimensionless parameters given
in Eq. (3.1) reduces to

where we have written ˜m = ˜m(cid:48)/ cos α. Solutions to this equation can be obtained by
solving the gradient ﬂow equation (3.30) and identifying ˜m with ˜m(cid:48). Thus, we can
recycle all the numerical solutions to (3.30).

The energy density consists of six parts; the domain wall TW , vortex string TS,
boojum TB, T4 = ∂kjk, QW and QB. The ﬁrst four contributions have no changes

Remember that the derivatives are with respect to the rescaled variables ˜xk.
In the following, we will set α = π/4 and consider the masses ˜m(cid:48) = 1/5, 1, 10
( ˜m = √2/5,√2, 10√2), as examples for the strong, intermediate and weak gauge
couplings, respectively.

Let us ﬁrst look at Fig. 51 in which the dyonic charge densities for ˜m(cid:48) = 1/5
are shown (the corresponding topological charge densities are shown in Fig. 5.). The
distributions are quite diﬀerent from those in the weak coupling solution. The domain
wall steeply bends. Since HH†
(cid:39) v2 holds everywhere for the strong gauge coupling,
the induced electric charge is tiny (∂3(HH†) (cid:39) 0), so that it is no longer suitable to
regard it as an electric capacitor, see the top-left panel of Fig. 51. Only the region
near the junction point is evidently charged positively, whereas the electric charge
densities become diluted far away from the junction point. The electric and magnetic
force lines are shown in the top-right panel of Fig. 51. The region, having the boojum
shown in the middle-right panel of Fig. 5, is where the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
are not orthogonal.

– 94 –

Fig. 52 shows the electric charge densities for the intermediate mass ˜m(cid:48) = 1 (the
corresponding topological charge densities are shown in Fig. 6). Since the curvature
of the domain wall is now smaller, the separation between the positive and negative
electric charges is visible. Mean distance is of the same order as the domain wall width
2 ˜m(cid:48) = 2. Unlike the strong coupling case, both the positive and negative electric
charge densities are not localized near the junction point, but they extend along the
domain wall. The positive charges are distributed across the whole domain wall,
whereas the negative charges have no support around the junction point. Therefore,
the electric force lines bends near the junction point and asymptotically becomes
vertical far from the boojum (see the top-right panel of Fig. 52).

Finally, we show the dyonic solution for ˜m(cid:48) = 10 in Fig. 53. As expected, it
is clearly similar to an electric capacitor with a large distance 2 ˜m(cid:48) = 20 between
positive and negative charges. The electric force lines are vertical except for the
region near the boojum. From Fig. 53 one clearly sees that the electric charge and
Noether charge appear on the outer skins of the domain wall in the weak coupling
region. The Noether charge densities on the two outer skins have the same sign, so
that the total Noether charge does not vanish. The charge ˜QB is negative on the
outer skins but it is positive inside the domain wall, which is consistent with the fact

−∞ dx3 ˜QB = 0.

In this paper we have analysed various 1/4 BPS conﬁgurations by numerically solving
the corresponding master equations. However, in doing so, the need for asymptot-
ically well-behaving initial conﬁgurations led us to the novel method, how to ap-
proximate composite solitons. Let us illustrate this method by recalling the simplest
1/4 BPS conﬁguration, that is a vortex string attached to the domain wall, which
we have studied in Sec. 3. In moduli matrix formalism, the corresponding master
equation in dimensionless coordinates reads

∂2

3u − 1 +(cid:16)ρ2e ˜mx3 + e− ˜mx3(cid:17) e−u = 0.

(7.1)

In Sec. 3 we argued that an approximate solution, which asymptotically approaches
the true solution in all directions is

U ≡ uW(cid:18)x3 +

uS(ρ),

(7.2)

where uW (x3) is a solution to a domain wall ‘part’ and uS(ρ) a solution to the vortex
string ‘part’ of the composite soliton. In other words, these functions are solutions
to 1/2 BPS master equations

∂2

3uW = 1 −(cid:16)e ˜mx3 + e− ˜mx3(cid:17)e−uW ,
∂ρuS = 1 − ρ2e−uS .

∂2

(7.3)

(7.4)

The function U is designed to solve Eq. (7.1) in regions far away from vortex string,
where |∂ρU| (cid:28) 1. Indeed, using asymptotic behavior of the string solution uS(ρ) ∼
log ρ2 we can easily see that the function

uW(cid:0)x3 + log ρ/ ˜m(cid:1) + log ρ,

(7.5)

solves Eq. (7.1), if we neglect derivatives with respect to ρ. On the other hand, if
we look at region dominated by the vortex string, that is x3 (cid:29) 1, we see from the
asymptotic property of the domain wall part uW (x3) ∼ ˜mx3 that the approximate
solution takes the form

x3 (cid:29) 1 .

U ∼ uS(ρ) + ˜mx3,

(7.6)
This indeed solves Eq. (7.1), if we neglect the term e− ˜mx3 on the right hand side.
The only place where U fails to solve the master equation is the junction point of
the vortex string and the domain wall – the boojum. Thus, U approximates the true
solution globaly, which is not the case for the commonly used inﬁnite gauge coupling

approximation U∞ ≡ log(cid:16)ρ2e ˜mx3 + e− ˜mx3(cid:17). Indeed, if we evaluate the left hand side

– 99 –

kU∞(ρ, x3)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x3=− log ρ/ ˜m

of the master equation (7.1) along the domian wall’s position x3 = − log ρ/ ˜m we
obtain
(7.7)

= ˜m2 +

∂2

ρ2 .

This shows that region of discrepancy between the true solution and U∞ is not bound
to a ﬁnite region like in the case of U∞ .
Amongst other advantages, the approximation U also enabled us in Sec. 3 to
calculate all topological charges exactly and helped us to reﬁne the arguments, which
lead to the derivation of the general formula for the boojum charge in Eq. (3.51).

More importantly, the same strategy can be used to create approximations to
virtually any 1/4 BPS conﬁguration. Let us brieﬂy summarize all composite solitons,
which we have treated in this way.

A collinear vortex strings attached from both sides of the domain wall is approx-

This ends our recounting of approximate solutions given in previous sections. As we
see, the general way how to construct approximations to composite solitons is to ﬁrst
solve the corresponding domain wall ‘part’ uW by ignoring x1 and x2 derivatives and
then replace these coordinates inside uW by appropriate vortex string solutions.

The 1/2 BPS pieces entering our approximations are solutions to single domain
wall uW (x3), double domain wall uW (x3; δ), vortex strings u(n)
S and semi-local vortex
strings u(n)
SLS. These pieces can be supplied as numerical solutions of corresponding
1/2 BPS master equations, which are generally much easier to solve than the full
three-dimensional 1/4 BPS master equations. A complementary way is to obtain

– 101 –

analytic approximations to 1/2 BPS solitons. This is the goal of this section. In
the following subsections we will develop accurate analytic approximations to both
vortex string and domain wall.

Especially accurate approximations can be found for vortex string master equa-
tion Eq. (7.4), since there is no intrinsic mass scale as in the case of domain wall
master equation Eq. (7.3). This allows easy use of the so-called global Pad´e method,
which we describe in the next subsection.

7.1 Approximations to ANO vortex

The master equation for single vortex string reads

∂2
ρuS +

1
ρ

∂ρuS = 1 − ρ2e−uS .

(7.26)

No analytic solution of Eq. (7.26) is known. In order to construct global approx-
imations, we take advantage of what we can learn about uS locally. In particular, let
us investigate behaviour of uS close to ρ = 0 and for large ρ (cid:29) 1. Expanding uS in
Taylor series around origin and matching coeﬃcients on both sides of Eq. (7.26) we
obtain

uS(ρ) = u0 +

ρ4 +

ρ6 + O(ρ8) ,

(7.27)

ρ2 −

e−u0

where u0 ≡ uS(0). Note that have used the regularity condition u(cid:48)

other hand, the asymptotic behaviour of uS is

S(0) = 0. On the

uS(ρ) ∼ 2 log(ρ) + qK0(ρ) ∼ log(cid:0)ρ2 + qρ3/2e−ρ(cid:1) as ρ → ∞ .

Here, K0(ρ) is the modiﬁed Bessel function and q > 0 is some constant.

(7.28)

Both u0 and q are locally undetermined; their values cannot be ascertain neither
by Taylor series nor by asymptotic series. In other words, these numbers characterize
global properties of uS and as such, they are very hard to study analytically. Recently,
a detailed study of Eq. (7.26) was published [75], where based on a perturbative
expansion around small winding number, the numbers u0 and q (2D1 and 2C1 in
their notation) were obtained with high precision, both analytically and numerically.
In the following, we shall adopt the values u0 = 1.01072165 and q = 3.41572835
(Eq. (2.66) in [75]) in all our approximations.

A (global) Pad´e approximant is a widely used tool to model a function based
on its series expansion(s). The basic idea is to ﬁnd a rational function which, when
expanded, match all series to given orders. Generally, such approximant tends to
be very accurate even outside radii of convergence and for suﬃciently nice functions
(such as meromorphic functions) it remains close to the true solution everywhere.

Nevertheless, there is only so much a rational function can do. In particular,
as we see from Eq. (7.28), the asymptotic formula for uS contains log, exp and
square root (suggesting essential singularity at inﬁnity), neither of which can be

– 102 –

u(p+3,p) = log(cid:16)ρ2 + e−ρ(cid:115)Pp+3(ρ)
Qp(ρ) (cid:17) ,

(7.29)

globally approximated by rational functions. Therefore, simple Pad´e approximants
are insuﬃcient in this case.

A way to overcome these diﬃculties, originally discussed in [76], is to put the
Pad´e approximant directly into the asymptotic series, in such a way that singular
terms are replaced by rational functions, which coeﬃcients are ﬁxed to match Taylor
series at origin.
In this way, the resulting function is guaranteed to behave in a
desired way both at origin and at inﬁnity.

Let us, therefore, propose the following ansatz:

where Pp+3(ρ) and Qp(ρ) are polynomials of order p + 3 and p respectively. The
coeﬃcients are chosen such that they give correct large ρ behaviour

Pp+3(ρ)
Qp(ρ) −−−→ρ→∞ q2ρ3 ,

(7.30)

and the remaining ones are ﬁxed to match the Taylor series (7.27) up to O(ρ2p+3).
After this procedure is done, it needs to be checked that both Pp+3(ρ) and Qp(ρ) are
strictly positive for ρ ≥ 0, as we require that u(p+3,p) is regular on the positive semi-
axis. It turns out that this is satisﬁed only up to p = 4 and for higher p singularities
appear.

We have found the following Pad´e approximants

Let us illustrate the accuracy of our approximations for p = 0, 2, 4. In Fig. 54
we show relative diﬀerence between u(p+3,p) and numerical solution and in Fig. 55
we show the master equation evaluated for each approximation.
It demonstrates
that u(p+3,p) is increasingly more accurate for larger p. As we already mentioned
u(8,5) is not a regular function. This seems to persist even for higher values of p,
indicating that capacity of this particular ansatz to approximate true solution has
been exhausted.

– 104 –

Approximations u(p+3,p) have, however, one disadvantage, namely that they de-
pend on odd powers of ρ. In contrast, series (7.27) contains only even powers. The
coeﬃcients must be therefore ﬁne-tuned to eliminate all odd powers, especially the
ﬁrst power, since its presence cause a singularity in the master equation (7.26) at
ρ = 0. Due to the ﬁnite precision of decimal representation of real numbers, this
ﬁne tuning is realised only imperfectly, which means that all odd powers, although
strongly suppressed, are still present.

To overcome this technical issue we also considered the following ansatz

uc(p+3,p) = log(cid:18)ρ2 +

(7.41)

The advantage is that uc(p+3,p) have only even powers of ρ in the expansion around

While uc(3,0) ranks somewhere between u(3,0) and u(5,2), as far as accuracy is
concerned, uc(6,3) is roughly an order of magnitude better than u(7,4) and it is the
best approximation to us(ρ), which we have found.

7.2 Approximations to domain wall

In this subsection we shall for notational convenience relabel third coordinate as
y ≡ x3 and we also omit the ˜ on the parameter m ≡ ˜m, even though we are still
using the dimensionless coordinates. The master equation for a single domain wall
thus reads

For generic value of the parameter m, no analytic solution is known. However, for
particular values of m, some exact solutions are available [73]. In our notation they
are given as

u3/2 =

u1 = y + log(cid:16)1 + 2e−y + e−2y(cid:17) ,
u2 = 2y + log(cid:16)1 + 2√6e−y + 8e−2y + 2√6e−3y + e−4y(cid:17) ,

the equation

In order to construct analytic approximations, let us see how the generic solution
behaves for large positive values of y. The dominant term is clearly uW ∼ my. If we
set uW ∼ my + δu and neglect higher order terms (i.e. e−2myδuW , (δuW )2) we obtain

∂2

y δuW = δuW − e−2my ,

(7.51)
which gives δuW = c e−y + 1
1−4m2 e−2my, where c is an arbitrary constant (the second
independent solution to homogenous equation ey is discarded, since δuW must be
negligible compared with my for large values of y). This formula does not apply in
the case m = 1/2, where instead we have δuW (m = 1/2) = c e−y + 1
4e−y(1 + 2y). As
this case is somewhat anomalous, we shall omit it and in the following we assume
that m > 1/2.

Combining the δuW correction with the dominant term into a single logarithm

we obtain the asymptotic form

uW ∼ log(cid:16)emy + c e(m−1)y +

1

1 − 4m2 e−my(cid:17) ,

y (cid:29) 1 .

(7.52)

At this point, we do not know the value of the constant c. However, for speciﬁc
values of m, one can exploit reﬂection symmetry of the solution uW (−y) = uW (y)
to obtain a rather good estimate.
In order to do that, let us look on additional
sub-leading terms. Repeating the procedure outlined above, we obtain next order
corrections combined into a single logarithm as:

uW ∼ log(cid:16)emy + c e(m−1)y +

c

(1 − 4m2)2(1 − 16m2)

(7.53)

e−3my(cid:17) .

Notice that this asymptotic form contains (upon factoring out the dominant term
emy) either powers of e−2my or powers of e−y or their combinations. If we focus on
half-integer values of m these factors can be the same, which we use to our advantage,
since in that case we can force the reﬂection symmetry. Let us illustrate this on the
case m = 1. We have

u1 ∼ log(cid:16)ey + c +

c2 − 1

e−y −

e−2y +

e−3y(cid:1) .

(7.54)

The strategy of harvesting approximate solutions from the asymptotic forms, which
we adopt from now on, is that we discard terms not compatible with the boundary

condition u → −my as y → −∞. In the present case, the terms e−2y and e−3y would
grow faster than e−y as y → −∞, so we discard them. Doing so it only remains to

ensure the reﬂection symmetry of u1, which ﬁx the constant to be c = 2. Thus

u1 ∼ log(cid:16)ey + 2 + e−y(cid:17) .

– 106 –

(7.55)

Surprisingly, this approximation is in fact an exact solution (7.48)! It turns out that
terms we have discarded are exactly cancelled by sub-leading terms.

The next case m = 3/2, including next-to-next leading order corrections to u,

has the asymptotic form with incompatible terms already discarded given as

u3/2 ∼ log(cid:16)e3y/2 + c ey/2 +

e−y/2 +

c2

c3 − 3
24

e−3y/2(cid:17) .

(7.56)

We see that the choice c = 3 makes the above approximation an even function of
y. Again u3/2 with c = 3 is an exact solution (7.49). Repeating the same steps for
m = 2, we obtain the form

u2 ∼ log(cid:16)e2y + c ey +

c2
3

(7.57)
and unique value of c, which ensures reﬂection symmetry, is now c = 2√6. Indeed,
this choice of c makes u2 an exact solution (7.50).

All three exact solutions u1, u3/2 and u2 were ﬁrst reported in [73] and it seems
that they are the only ones. Indeed, if we continue this procedure for m = 5/2 we
obtain the asymptotic form

u5/2 ∼ log(cid:16)e5y/2 + c e3y/2 +

e−5y/2(cid:17) (7.58)

and upon inspection, we conclude there is no choice of the constant c, which would
make the above approximation an even function of y.

At this point we adopt the attitude of ‘patching’ the asymptotic form in such a
way, that it becomes symmetric under the reﬂection y → −y. The condition for c is
chosen in such a way that the patching aﬀects only the inner-most terms. Thus, we
choose c2/3 = c3/24, which yields c = 8. Then we ﬁx the coeﬃcients of e−3y/2 and
e−5y/2 to match their reﬂected counterparts. In other words, we have

u5/2 ∼ log(cid:16)e5y/2 + 8e3y/2 +

e−y/2 + 8e−3y/2 + e−5/2(cid:17) ,

which is however only approximative solution, but surprisingly accurate one, as can
be seen on Fig. 56.

The process of creating approximations for higher half-integer masses can be now
automated. Let us denote m = p/2. Based on the previous analysis let us adopt the
ansatz:

allow us to ﬁx c1 = 1, c2 = 3 and c3 = 24 (see Eq. (7.57)). The remaining coeﬃcients

These gives a recursion relation

with the solution

Remarkably, all additional symmetry conditions, such as cp−k/cp−k = ck/ck for k =

which are entirely determined by the reﬂection symmetry and few bits of ”initial”
data, namely the ﬁrst three coeﬃcients c1 = 1, c2 = 3 and c3 = 24. Note that (7.65)
does not include m = 1(p = 2) case. It should be treated separately as in (7.55).

Given the spartan amount of information used in construction of these approxi-
mations, it is remarkable how accurate they are. We illustrate this fact on Fig. 56,
where we compare up/2 to numerical solutions.

8. Exact solutions to 1/4 BPS solitons

In this paper we have so far relied on numerical methods to provide us with solutions
to 1/2 and 1/4 BPS master equations (see Secs. 3-6). Although we have discussed

– 108 –

analytic approximations for 1/2 BPS solitons and a wide variety of 1/4 BPS solitons
(see Sec. 7 for summary), these were primarily used as initial conﬁgurations for
the numerical calculations. In this section we will complement both numerical and
approximative analysis by discussing exact solutions of 1/4 BPS solitons, which we
have found.

Any composite soliton, such as a vortex string attached to a domain wall, can
be reduced to pure wall(s), or pure string(s) in some appropriate limit, i.e. either by
shifting wall or string to inﬁnity via the corresponding moduli parameter. Therefore,
any exact 1/4 BPS solution potentially contains 1/2 BPS solutions as its limiting
cases. Hence, before we can discuss exact composite soliton solutions we must ﬁrst
discuss exact domain wall and vortex string solutions.

In the following subsections we will present novel exact vortex string and exact
domain wall solutions, out of which we construct new 1/4 BPS solutions. Throughout
this section we use dimensionful coordinates.

8.1 M = diag(m, 0,−m,−m)
The master equation for the model with NF = 4 and the mass matrix given as above
reads in general

2g2v2(cid:16)4∂z∂¯zu+∂2

3u(cid:17) = 1−(cid:16)e2mx3

|h1(z)|2+|h2(z)|2+e−2mx3(cid:0)|h3(z)|2+|h4(z)|2(cid:1)(cid:17)e−u,

(8.1)
where H0 = (h1, h2, h3, h4) are elements of the moduli matrix. The generic soliton
conﬁguration consists of a pair of domain walls, where the right wall has vortices
attached from positive direction of x3 axis (complex zeros of h1), left wall has semi-
local vortices attached from negative direction of x3 axis (complex zeros of h3 and/or
h4) and both walls have vortices stretched between them (complex zeros of h2). The
walls are bent if the net vorticity of incoming and outgoing vortex-strings is not
equal. Asymptotically, the right wall has the proﬁle x3 ≈ 1
the left wall it is x3 ≈ − 1
Let us ﬁrst discuss an exact vortex string solution of this model. Since there are
no known exact ANO vortices, based over non-degenerate vacua, we set h1 = h2 = 0
and look for exact solutions over the leftmost degenerate vacuum. Getting rid of the
x3 dependence by shifting u → u − 2mx3 in the master equation (8.1), we are left
with the master equation for semi-local vortices:

2m log(cid:0)|h2|2 /(|h3|2 + |h4|2)(cid:1).

m log(cid:0)|h1| /|h2|(cid:1), while for

2

g2v2 ∂z∂¯zu = 1 − (|h3(z)|2 + |h4(z)|2)e−u.

This equation has an exact solution, namely

u2F

√8/(gv). The vorticity of u2F

g2v2 |z|2 and |h4|2 = |z|4. Loosely, we could think about u2F

SLS is indeed 2.

Now, let us consider domain wall solutions. We set |h1|2 = 1, |h2|2 = e2R and

|h3|2 = |h4|2 = 1. The master equation (8.1) reduces to

1
2g2v2 ∂2

3u = 1 −(cid:16)e2mx3 + e2R + e−2mx3(cid:17)e−u,

(8.4)

where the parameter 2R/m can be interpreted as the separation of walls for R (cid:29) m.
If R is close to or less than m, the domain walls cannot be distinguished from one
another and they form a single (compressed) domain wall. In the limit R → −∞ the
middle vacuum disappears completely and only a single elementary wall remains.

There are two exact solutions for this equation. The ﬁrst one

uDW = 2 log(cid:16)emx3 +(cid:112)e2R − 6 + e−mx3(cid:17) ,

m2
2g2v2 = 1,

(8.5)

was originally reported in [73]. Notice that uDW describes arbitrarily separated/com-
pressed pair of walls (depending on the value of parameter R), but the ratio m/(gv)
is ﬁxed. On the other hand, the second solution

uCW = 2 log(cid:16)emx3 + e−mx3(cid:17) ,

m2
2g2v2 ≤

1
4

,

(8.6)

describes walls with separations up to R = 1
walls in uCW are always compressed, but unlike in the previous solution, ratio m/(gv)

g2v2(cid:1) ≤ log √2. In other words,
can be varied up to the upper bound 1/√2. Reaching this limit, we have R → −∞

2 log(cid:0)2− 4m2

and the solution uCW reduces to an exact single wall solution, reported in [73], which
we have denoted as u1 in Sec. 7.

Now we have all the necessary pieces to discuss exact composite soliton solutions,

which reads

Remarkably, this formulation is functionally identical to the analytic approximation
(7.2) for a single vortex string attached to the domain wall (only this time, the string
is attached from the left side).7

7The disparity of factors multiplying string solutions inside the wall solutions is due to the
diﬀerent choices of the mass matrix M for the approximate solution (7.2) and for the exact solution
(8.7).

The bending of the compressed domain wall can be exactly obtained by equating

g2v2(cid:1).
gv log(cid:0)|z|2+ 4

both terms inside the logarithm in the solution (8.7), that is x3 = − 2
Curiously, this bending is equivalent to the bending produced by a single semi-local
4
vortex of the core size
g2v2 . However, by comparing the solution (8.7) with the
Eq. (8.3) we recognize that the attached string is identical to u2F
SLS. (The solutions
become identical as x3 → −∞.)
SW indeed describes a non-elementary wall uCW with non-
elementary string u2F
SLS attached from the left. The same conﬁguration with string
attached from the right side can be achieved by reﬂection x3 → −x3. Notice that
position of the domain wall can be changed by shifting x3, while position of the string
can be changed by shifting z → z − z0. We plot the total energy density and boojum
charge density on Fig. 57.

Thus, the solution u4F

where H0 = (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) are elements of the moduli matrix. The generic
soliton conﬁguration is composed of four domain walls. As in the previous example,
the complex zeros of the moduli elements hi(z), i = 1, . . . , 6 determine number and
positions of vortices, attached and stretched between successive walls (as well as their
asymptotic proﬁles).

Since we have doubly degenerate vacuum between second and third wall, the
exact vortex string solution of this model is again u2F
SLS, as deﬁned in Eq. (8.3).
However, it is necessary to prove to introduce a more general solution of the semi-
local vortex string based on NF = 3 model, with the master equation

Again, the parameter 2R/m can be interpreted as the separation of walls for R (cid:29) m.

This solution is a combination of the wall solution uDCW with the semi-local string
solution u3F

Notice that the ratio of mass and gauge coupling (parameter α) can only vary in
a certain interval, outside of which the solution is not valid. The edges of the interval
correspond to extreme cases. In the limit α2 → 1/2 we see that a, b → ∞, a/b → 4
g2v2
and the solution becomes u6F
SLS. In other words, this limit corresponds to
inﬁnite separation of walls. In the other extreme α2 → 1 we have a → √6, b → 0 and
h2, h3, h4, h5 → 0 as a consequence. In other words, both domain walls are inﬁnitely
compressed and the vortex string disappears. This domain wall is an exact solution,
which we denoted as u2 is Sec. 7.

SW → u2F

By shifting x3 and z coordinates we can change the position of the conﬁguration
as a whole, but interestingly the separation between the walls is not a moduli of
the solution, but rather it is controlled by parameters of the model. As we can see,
as the walls are further apart the core size of the vortex string 1
1−α2 shrinks

8Notice that the solution is deﬁned for all values of R, but the parameter S is only deﬁned for
R ≥ log 2. If R < log 2, it is possible to ascribe S a purely imaginary value S = i
m arccos(eR/2),
with which the solution (8.18) is still real. This conﬁrms the intuition that the pair of wall merges
at R = log 2, where separation becomes zero S = 0.

local string fattens and, ultimately, diverges. This is a direct conﬁrmation of the
numerical observation made in Sec. 4.

8.3 Other exact solutions

SW and u6F

The two exact 1/4 BPS solitons u4F
SW are just illustrative examples of the
rich hierarchy of exact solutions. We believe that there exists 1/4 BPS exact solu-
tions in multi-ﬂavour models. Our preliminary investigations show that many new
conﬁgurations of domain walls and vortices can be constructed as a suitable combi-
nation of its 1/2 BPS constituents, in the same spirit as described in this section.
The list is potentially inﬁnite. To provide an exhaustive list of exact 1/4 BPS solu-
tion up to certain number of ﬂavors seems to be important task, which however lies
somewhat outside the scope of this paper. Therefore, we plan to address this issue
fully in a separate work. For parallel domain walls, this was already achieved by one
of us [Blaschke F., to appear].

All our exact solutions presented in this section shares the same trait: they are
only a special conﬁguration of solitons. The domain wall solution uCW describes a
pair of compressed elementary domain walls and both vortex string solutions u2,3F
SLS
describes a pair of coincident semi-local vortices. In other words, some moduli are
missing and we cannot provide exact results for generic conﬁguration of solitons.
Composite solitons u4F

SW naturally inherit this trait.

master equations directly implies existence of exact solutions in non-Abelian case.

– 114 –

This can be seen from the fact, that non-Abelian analog of the master equation
can be, for special U (1)-factorizable solutions, decomposed into a set of independent
Abelian master equations [32]. Thus, any exact solution in Abelian theory can be
used to construct exact solutions in non-Abelian theories.

9. Low energy eﬀective theory and Nambu-Goto/DBI action

In this section, we study 1/2 and 1/4 BPS conﬁgurations from the view point of the
low energy eﬀective actions, namely the Nambu-Goto (NG) action and the Dirac-
Born-Infeld (DBI) action for the domain wall. As is well known, a low energy eﬀective
theory of a simple domain wall with translational zero modes is the NG action. The
low energy eﬀective action for the domain wall with not only the translational zero
modes but also the internal moduli have been found to be the NG type [11, 77, 78] by
regarding the internal space as extra dimensions. It is also known that the DBI action
is dual to the NG action. In this section we show that the domain wall, the vortex
string ending on the domain wall and their dyonic extension are reproduced in the
NG action when the gauge coupling constant is taken to the inﬁnity. In the strong
gauge coupling limit, the vortex string asymptotically becomes the singular lump
string attached to the domain wall. We call this conﬁguration the spike domain
wall. The dyonic extension of this conﬁguration has been already studied in the
massive nonlinear sigma model on T ∗CP 1, and it was shown that the conﬁguration
is realized as BIon in the DBI action [11]. We review the dyonic extension of the
spike domain wall from the view point of the NG action. Finally we discuss whether
the non-singular lump string with the size moduli, the semi-local boojums studied
in subsection 3.3.3, can be realized in the DBI action.

9.1 Nambu-Goto action and Hamiltonian

We start with the NG action in (2 + 1)-space-time dimensions [11]:

LNG = − ˆTW(cid:113)det (ηαβ − ∂αX∂βX − ∂αφ∂βφ) , α, β = 0, 1, 2 ,

(9.1)

where X and φ are scalar ﬁelds, which will be identiﬁed with the position and the
phase moduli of the domain wall solution and ˆTW is the membrane tension. Here we
have used the so-called physical gauge where the induced metric on the world-volume
of the brane is ﬂat (i.e. η = diag(1,−1,−1)). We can explicitly write this as

where

LNG = − ˆTW(cid:112)DNG ,

(9.2)

DNG = 1 − (∂αX∂αX) − (∂αφ∂αφ) + (∂αX∂αX)(∂βφ∂βφ) − (∂αX∂αφ)2 . (9.3)

where the index i, j = 1, 2 are summed over.

(9.5)

(9.6)

9.2 Domain wall, its dyonic extension and the NG action

Let us recall the domain wall solution discussed in section 2. The master equation for
the ﬂat domain wall is given in (2.25) when u is restricted to depend on x3 coordinate
only. In the strong gauge coupling limit, the master equation can be solved to give

ug→∞ = log Ω0 ,

(9.7)

where Ω0 is given in (2.25). For simplicity, let us consider NF = 2 case. In this case,
the moduli matrix H0(z) in (2.24) is just a constant. We choose

H0(z) =(cid:0)e− m

2 (X+iφ), e

with ξ = η = 1. Then (9.7) gives

m

2 (X+iφ)(cid:1) , M = diag(m/2,−m/2) .

ug→∞(x3) = log(em(x3−X) + e−m(x3−X)) .

(9.8)

(9.9)

This shows that the constant parameter X corresponds to the position moduli. The
other constant parameter φ is the internal moduli which is the Nambu-Goldstone
mode associated with the spontaneously broken U (1)F symmetry. The energy of the
domain wall is readily calculated by integrating (2.27) over all the space-directions

Ewall =(cid:90) d3x TW = TW A ,

(9.10)

where TW = mv2 is the domain wall’s tension and A is the area of the domain wall.
Now let us study the ﬂat domain wall solution in the NG action. It is just given

by considering constants for X and φ. The NG Hamiltonian (9.6) reduces to

The energy is obtained by integrating along the membrane directions:

HNG = ˆTW .

ENG =(cid:90) d2xHNG = ˆTW A .

– 116 –

(9.11)

(9.12)

The energy (9.10) and (9.12) completely coincide if the domain wall tension TW is
identiﬁed with the membrane tension ˆTW . Therefore, as expected, the NG action
with constant X and φ realizes the domain wall in the ﬁeld theoretical model.

Next we consider the Q-extension (dyonic-extension) of domain wall. Let us ﬁrst
recall the ﬁeld theory solution given in Eqs. (6.14) – (6.17). The dyonic extension
of the master equation is given in (6.24). Substituting (9.8) with X and φ being
constants into (6.24), we obtain the solution in the strong gauge coupling limit as

ug→∞(x3) = log(em cos α x3−mX + e−m cos α x3+mX) .

The energy of the system is obtained from (6.30) with (6.21) and (6.27):

EQ-wall =(cid:90) d3x (TW cos α + QW sin α) =(cid:113)T 2

W + Q2

W A ,

(9.13)

(9.14)

where we have used (6.29). The domain wall tension TW and the Noether charge
QW are calculated by (6.25) and (6.28): TW = mv2 and QW = mv2 tan α.

Let us consider the corresponding conﬁguration in the NG action. We take

time-dependent phase

X = const. , φ =

ω
ˆm

t ,

(9.15)

where ω is a constant angular velocity and we have introduced a constant parameter
ˆm of mass dimension one in order to make φ have mass dimension −1. In this case,
the energy is obtained as

The conserved momentum Pφ for this solution is given by

ENG =

A .

ˆTW(cid:112)1 − (ω/ ˆm)2
(cid:112)1 − (ω/ ˆm)2

ω/ ˆm

.

Pφ = ˆTW

(9.16)

(9.17)

(9.18)

Then the energy can be written as

ENG =(cid:113) ˆT 2

W + P 2

φ A ,

We identify TW = ˆTW as before. Furthermore, we should identify ω/ ˆm = sin α from
Eq. (6.14), which tells us that the Q-charge (6.29) in the ﬁeld theory is understood
as

Pφ = ˆTW tan α = QW .

(9.19)

Thus, Eq. (9.18) coincides with (9.14). We conclude that the conﬁguration (9.15) in
the NG action realizes the Q-extension of the domain wall in the ﬁeld theory.

9.3 Dyonic extension of spike domain wall and NG action

In this subsection, we study the 1/4 BPS dyonic extension of the spike domain
wall that the lump vortex attaches on the domain wall. The master equation for
this conﬁguration is given in (6.24) where u depends on all the space coordinates.
Considering NF = 2 case, the moduli matrix and the mass matrix are given by

H0(z) = (z, 1), M = diag(m/2,−m/2) .

In the strong gauge coupling limit the master equation (6.24) is solved as

ug→∞(z, ¯z, x3) = log(ρ2em cos α x3 + e−m cos α x3) ,

where |z|2 = ρ2. The total energy of the conﬁguration is

E1/4 =(cid:90) d3x(TW cos α + QW sin α + TS + TB) ,

(9.20)

(9.21)

(9.22)

where TS and TB are deﬁned in (6.22) and (6.23), respectively. Taking into account
the fact that in the strong gauge coupling limit (6.23) is vanishing, the energy is
given as

E1/4 =(cid:113)T 2

W + Q2

W A + TSL .

(9.23)

Here we have used (6.29) and TS is the string tension given in (6.31), TS = 2πv2|k|
where k is the vortex winding number and L is length of the vortex string.
We consider the corresponding conﬁguration in the NG action. We take the

following conﬁguration:

X → X(x1, x2), φ →

ω
ˆm

t + φ(x1, x2) .

To simplify notation, let us introduce

Then the Hamiltonian (9.6) is expressed as

HNG = ˆTW

where 12 = 1 and we have used a2

(cid:33) ,

(9.27)

– 118 –

where

H = 1 + (ai)2 + (˜bi)2 + (ijai

˜bj)2 .

(9.28)

Now we are ready to minimize the Hamiltonian HNG. To this end, we ﬁrst minimize
H as

H = (ai ± ij

˜bj)2 + (1 ∓ ijai

˜bj)2 ≥ (1 ∓ ijai

˜bj)2 .

The last inequality is saturated when the equation

ai ± ij

˜bj = 0

(9.29)

(9.30)

is satisﬁed. The key observation is that when the equation (9.30) holds the ﬁrst term
in (9.27) is minimized while the second term is maximized. Indeed, the numerator
˜bj)2 becomes maximum when ai is
in the second term is maximized because (ijai
orthogonal to bi, and at the same time the denominator is minimized. Taking account
of the minus sign in front of the second term of Eq. (9.27), it is found that the
Hamiltonian is minimized when the BPS equation (9.30) is satisﬁed. The BPS energy
in terms of the original variable X is given by

HNG = ˆTW(cid:40)

1

(cid:112)1 − (ω/ ˆm)2

+(cid:112)1 − (ω/ ˆm)2(∂iX)2(cid:41) .

(9.31)

We now consider that a point particle corresponding to the end point of the lump
string is placed on the membrane. Comparing Eqs. (9.8) and (9.20), one is naturally
lead to the following identiﬁcation

φ = ±

(9.33)

where ρ =(cid:112)(x1)2 + (x2)2. With the solution (9.33), the Hamiltonian (9.31) turns

out to be

Identifying TW = ˆTW and m = ˆm, it is found that

2π ˆTW / ˆm (TW = mv2) coincides with the string tension TS = 2πv2 in the ﬁeld theory.
Respecting ˆL with the length of the vortex string, the energy (9.36) coincides with
(9.23) in the ﬁeld theoretical model.

9.4 Relation between solutions of NG action and DBI action

In this subsection, we show that the dyonic extension of the spike domain wall (9.20)
in the ﬁeld theory is also realized in the DBI action [11]. Rather than minimizing
the Hamiltonian of the DBI action we derive the BPS equations in the DBI action
by transforming Eq. (9.30).

First we derive (2 + 1)-dimensional DBI action from the NG action (9.1) by

dualization

where the last term is called the BF term consisting of ˆFαβ = ∂α
abelian ﬁeld strength and κ an arbitrary constant of mass dimension −2. Notice that
the term we added is a total divergence and it therefore has no eﬀect on dynamics.
Let us eliminate φ by using its equation of motion. Variation of the above Lagrangian
with respect to ∂αφ leads to the condition

ˆAβ − ∂β

Eqs. (9.39)–(9.42) can be combined together to solve for DNG:

where the validity of the last equality can be checked by direct evaluation of the
determinant.

Next we derive the Hamiltonian. In the following we set ˙X = 0 since we are not
interested in the conﬁguration where X depends on time. First we shall write the
Lagrangian (9.44) in terms of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds deﬁned by ˆF0i = ˆEi
(i = 1, 2) and ˆF12 = ˆB:

Note that this is diﬀerent from the DBI Hamiltonian obtained in Ref. [11].

Let us next rewrite the BPS equation (9.30) in terms of the DBI variables. To
this end, we ﬁrst show how ˆB and ˆEi are written in terms of the ﬁelds X and φ in
the NG action. For X → X(x1, x2) and φ → (ω/ ˆm)t + φ(x1, x2) as is given in (9.24),

(9.63)

Now we are ready to rewrite the BPS equation (9.30) in terms of the DBI lan-

guage. From (9.30) we have

DNG =(cid:0)1 + (∂iX)2(cid:1)(cid:0)1 − (ω/ ˆm)2 + (∂jφ)2(cid:1)

Substituting this into (9.63), we have

Furthermore, (9.59) gives us the relation

W Πi .

(9.71)

This is the BPS equation for the dyonic extension of the spike domain wall in terms
of the DBI variables. Note that we eventually arrive at the same BPS equation given
in [11], although our Hamiltonian (9.57) is diﬀerent from one in [11].

– 123 –

In order to check that this equation leads to the desired result, we substitute

(9.71) into the Hamiltonian (9.57). It yields

HDBI = ˆTW(cid:113)1 + ˆB2(cid:16)1 + ˆT −1

We shall consider the following conﬁguration:

Πi =

(9.72)

(9.73)

This conﬁguration represents that the unit electric charge is placed on the membrane.
This fact is understood from the relation (9.68), which gives

ˆEi = ˆT −1

W Πi =

Thus, the factor 1/ ˆm is interpreted as an electric charge. A solution of the BPS
equation (9.71) which is called the BIon is in this case

ˆm(cid:113)1 + ˆB2 log ρ .

Substituting (9.73) into (9.72) and integrating over the membrane directions, we ﬁnd
the energy of the conﬁguration as

(9.76)

EDBI = ˆTW(cid:113)1 + ˆB2A +

2π ˆTW

ˆm (cid:113)1 + ˆB2(log R − log δ) ,

where we have introduced the infrared and ultraviolet cutoﬀ ρ = R and ρ = δ,
respectively. The energy is rewritten as

EDBI = ˆTW(cid:113)1 + ˆB2A +

2π ˆTW
ˆm

ˆL ,

(9.77)

where ˆL = X(δ) − X(R). Taking (9.70) with the choice ω/ ˆm = sin α, ˆTW = TW ,

and ˆm = m into account, it is found that this expression is the same with (9.36)
obtained in the NG action. Therefore it is concluded that the BPS equation (9.71)
in the DBI action reproduces the dyonic extension of the spike domain wall (9.20)
in the ﬁeld theory.

Before closing this subsection, let us make a comment on the relation between the
magnetic scalar potential ϕ introduced by (3.88) in Sec. 3.5 and X given in (9.75).
ϕ is the scalar potential for the magnetic ﬁeld Bi(x1, x2) in the original gauge theory.
We have found the relation ϕ = mx3(x1, x2)/dW and x3(x1, x2) = −uS(x1, x2)/2m. In
the strong gauge coupling limit, we have uS = log ρ2, so that x3(x1, x2) = −(log ρ)/m,
which precisely coincides with (9.75) in the case of ˆB = 0. On the other hand, from
(9.74) and (9.75), X is the scalar potential for the dual electric ﬁeld ˆEi(x1, x2). Thus,
the magnetic ﬁeld Bi in the original gauge theory and the dual electric ﬁeld ˆEi in
the eﬀective theory are generated by the same static potential.

9.5 The semi-local BIon: Round spike conﬁguration and DBI action

In this subsection, we discuss the semi-local BIon – the round spike domain wall
conﬁguration, where the spike’s tip is smoothed out by introducing a lump size
moduli. This conﬁguration should be a DBI counterpart to the semi-local boojum
which we studied for the ﬁnite gauge coupling in subsection 3.3.3. Our purpose in
this subsection is to investigate whether the semi-local boojum in the strong gauge
coupling limit in the ﬁeld theory is realized in the DBI action.

As the simplest example of the semi-local vortex, let us consider NF = 3 case

with vanishing Q-charge. The moduli matrix of the conﬁguration is

H0(z) = (z, a, 1) , M = diag(m/2, m/2,−m/2).

(9.78)

where a ∈ R is a size moduli. Supposing that the u depends on all the space-

directions, the master equation (2.25) is solved as

ug→∞ = log(cid:110)(ρ2 + a2)emx3 + e−mx3(cid:111) .

(9.79)

The domain wall position is read oﬀ from the condition (ρ2 + a2)emx3 = e−mx3, which
gives

x3(ρ) = −

1
2m

log(ρ2 + a2) .

(9.80)

In the strong gauge coupling limit, since the boojum energy density (2.29) is vanish-
ing, the total energy (2.20) is just a sum of the domain wall tension and the vortex
string tension:

E1/4 =(cid:90) d3x (TW + TS) ,

(9.81)

where TW and TS are given in (2.27) and (2.28). We perform the integral along only
x3-direction:

E1/4 = TW A +(cid:90) d2x ES(x2, x2) ,

where ES is given by

ES(x1, x2) =

ρ2

(ρ2 + a2)2 +

a2

(ρ2 + a2)2 log(cid:8)1 + (ρ2 + a2)e2mΛ(cid:9)(cid:21) .

Here we have introduced the infrared cutoﬀ x3 = Λ. In the following, we focus on
the contribution of the energy from the vortex string in (9.83). We separate it into
two parts as

(9.82)

(9.83)

ES =(cid:90) d2x ES(x1, x2) = ES1 + ES2 ,

(9.86)

Integration over ρ from a UV cutoﬀ ρ = δ (δ (cid:28) a) to an IR cutoﬀ ρ = R (R (cid:29) a),
see Fig. 59, we ﬁnd

(9.87)

(9.88)

where we have assumed that the cutoﬀ Λ is suﬃciently large and that the second
term in the logarithm in (9.86) is dominant. Taking account of (9.80) and assuming
a > δ, (9.87) and (9.88) are rewritten as

ES1 (cid:39) −2πv2(cid:18)x3(R) − x3(δ) +
2m(cid:19) + O(cid:18) δ2

ES2 (cid:39) −2πv2(x3(δ) − Λ) + O(cid:18) δ2
a2(cid:19) .

(9.89)

(9.90)

These results tell us that ES1 is the vortex string energy between x3(R) and x3(δ)
while ES2 is one between x3(δ) and Λ. We show each contribution schematically in
Fig. 59. As can be seen from Fig. 59, ES2 corresponds to the energy contributed by
the lump string which is perpendicular to the domain wall. On the other hand, ES1
is contribution from a part of lump string (ρ > a) whose angle from the x1-x2 plane
is in the range of [0, π/2). Thus, we expect that only ES1 is reproduced within the
DBI theory.

For a > 1 the curve (9.80) does not cross the ρ axis (the upper panel in Fig. 59).
As a is decreased, the curve crosses the ρ axis and x3(δ) goes to right along x3 axis
and the contribution of ES1 is dominant (the lower panel in Fig. 59) in ES. As a
is decreased further, the expressions (9.89) and (9.90) are no longer valid. In such
case, it is convenient to go back to the original expression (9.87) and (9.88). There
we can safely take a to be zero and ﬁnd that ES2 is vanishing while ES1 becomes

(log R − log δ) .
Using (9.80) with a = 0, this expression is rewritten as

ES1 =

2πv2
m

ES1 = TSL ,

– 126 –

(9.91)

(9.92)

where L = x3(δ)− x3(R) is the string length. Therefore, ES1 at a = 0 is nothing but
the lump string energy of zero size. Note that the lump string with a = 0 becomes
singular at x3 → ∞. Thus, a = 0 lump string attached to the domain wall is regular
except for ρ = 0, namely the angle to the x1-x2 plane is always in the range of [0, π/2)
except for the junction point. Therefore, the lump string of zero size ES1 should be
reproduced in the DBI theory for the whole region on the domain wall except for
ρ = 0.

Now let us consider the corresponding conﬁguration in the DBI action. The
Hamiltonian and the BPS equation in the DBI action are (9.72) and (9.71) with
ˆB = 0:

HDBI = ˆTW(cid:16)1 + ˆT −1
∂iX = ± ˆT −1

W Πi .

W Π2

i(cid:17) ,

The energy of the conﬁguration is

EDBI = ˆTW A + ˆT −1

W (cid:90) d2x Π2

i .

(9.93)

(9.94)

(9.95)

We expect that the second term of (9.95) coincides with ES1 given in (9.87). In order
to check this under the identiﬁcation TW = ˆTW , the following relation should hold:

v2
m

This is solved by

(ρ2 + a2)2 = ˆT −1
W Π2

i

( ˆTW = mv2).

ˆT −1
W Πi =

ρ2 + a2 .

Combining this with (9.94), we ﬁnd

X = −

1
2m

log(ρ2 + a2) .

(9.96)

(9.97)

(9.98)

This is precisely equal to (9.80)! Thus, we ﬁnd the semi-local BIon that is the desired
counterpart of the semi-local boojum in the original gauge theory. Note that ES1 in
(9.89) with δ = 0 does not depend on a, since we can absorb it into the IR cutoﬀ by
taking R = (1 + ˜R)a, where ˜R > 0 is a new cutoﬀ. In this sense, we can interpret a
as a moduli parameter of the semi-local BIon.

While ES1 is correctly reproduced in the DBI action, ES2 is missing. As explained
above, ES2 corresponds to a part of the lump string perpendicular to the domain wall.
To reproduce this correctly, we should take additional zero modes into account. So
far, we have considered only the zero modes localized on the domain wall. However,
there are non-normalizable zero modes in the bulk because a part of ﬂavor symmetry

remains unbroken in the model with the partially degenerate masses (9.78). We
expect that ES2 would be correctly reproduced once we include coupling between
the localized zero modes and non-normalizable zero modes. It would be interesting
to ﬁgure out the interaction, but it is beyond the scope of this paper, so we leave it
as a future work.

The last comment is on the dual electric charge. The electric ﬁeld (9.74) for the

where we recover the dimensional parameter κ. Interestingly, the behavior of ˆEi is
similar to one of the magnetic ﬁeld in the domain wall discussed in subsection 3.3.3.
There it was found that the observer in the domain wall sees that the magnetic ﬁeld
of the magnetic point source, which obeys the modiﬁed Coulomb’s law in a region far
from the magnetic source. Similarly, in the DBI theory the observer in the domain
wall sees that the electric ﬁeld obeys the modiﬁed Coulomb’s law in a region far
from the electric point source placed in the domain wall. Recalling the discussion in
section 3.5, we see that the electric charge placed on the membrane is given as

10. Outlook

In this paper, we have studied 1/4 BPS equations in the Abelian-Higgs theory. As
written at the end of Sec. 8, our solutions also solve non-Abelian BPS equations
by trivial embedding. While these embedding solutions are essentially Abelian solu-
tions, genuine non-Abelian objects, like ’t Hooft-Polyakov monopoles, may join the
game in the non-Abelian theories. We will investigate non-Abelian extensions of 1/4
BPS solutions including monopoles, boojums, domain walls and vortex strings in
forthcoming works. It is also interesting to study the 1/4 BPS equations in diﬀerent
spacetime dimensions. For example, the 1/4 BPS equations for vortex sheets and
instanton particles in 5 dimensions [22, 52], and those for the domain wall junctions
in 3 dimensions [43, 44] are known, but only a little is known about their solutions
both in the Abelian and non-Abelian theories for the ﬁnite gauge coupling constants.
We will also proceed to obtain numerical/analytical solutions for these series of 1/4
BPS equations. Furthermore, the technique developed in this paper may help to
solve another type of 1/4 BPS equations or 1/8 BPS equations [69, 54] for which
nothing has been known except for the BPS equations.

We obtained the solution of the vortex strings attached to the tilted domain walls
on which constant background magnetic ﬁeld is turned on. This is quite similar to
D1-branes suspended between tilted D3-branes. The D1-branes can be seen as the
magnetic monopoles in non-commutative spacetime [67, 68]. As a natural analogy,
the vortex strings suspended between tilted domain walls in the gauge theory should
be seen as electrically charged particles in a low energy eﬀective theory which is a
non-commutative theory. If this is the case, the similarity between the solitons in
ﬁeld theories and D-branes in string theories, which is repeated in the literature, is
further reinforced.

SW and u6F

We have stumbled upon unexpected analytic results, namely exact solutions to
1/2 and 1/4 BPS master equations in models with NF ≤ 6 described in Sec. 8. As
we stated, we believe that these solutions are just simplest examples of a potentially
inexhaustible wealth of exact solutions in models with ever larger number of ﬂavors
of fundamental Higgs ﬁelds. The indirect evidence for this steams from the fact that
our exact composite solitons, denoted as u4F
SW , have been ‘build’ from of 1/2
BPS exact solutions for walls and strings. Therefore, it is natural to expect that more
complicated combinations should give us another 1/4 BPS solutions in higher ﬂavor
models. The exact rules of this ‘solitonic engineering’ are so far unclear. However, the
preliminary results shows, that certain restrictions on 1/2 BPS components must be
in place, if they are to be used in construction of 1/4 BPS solutions. We have spotted
glimpses of this in Sec. 8, namely that domain walls must have suﬃciently low tension
and cores of semi-local strings must be suﬃciently large. The full analysis of this is
an essential direction of future research. Furthermore, for parallel 1/2 BPS domain
walls, such analysis was done by one of us in the study [79], where it was shown that
exact multi-wall solutions can be build up from certain single wall solutions in quite
arbitrary fashion, except that the total tension of the ﬁnal domain wall conﬁguration
must be small enough. Eﬀectively, this restriction prevents development of an inner
layer inside domain walls, where unbroken phase appears. In fact, no exact solution
of domain wall with this inner layer is known at present. Finding such a solution
remains as an interesting open problem. The similar study for semi-local vortices
is in preparation. By combining the ﬁndings for exact 1/2 BPS solitons we may be
able to clarify, how their combination can yield exact 1/4 BPS solitons. Naturally, in
doing so we may discover similar rules for other composite solitons, such as wall-wall
and string-string junctions, which we did not address in this paper. An interesting
questions is, whether all exact 1/4 BPS solution can be decomposed as combinations
of exact 1/2 BPS solutions, or whether some ‘irreducible’ solutions exist.

A further studies of composite solitons, especially in non-Abelian setting, may be
useful for ironing out the phenomenology of dynamically realized brane-world scenar-
ios. In string theory, it is known that intersecting D-branes can generate Standard
Model gauge group, chiral fermions and family replication (see [80] and references
therein). Similar results were obtained within the ﬁeld theory as well. Indeed, domain
walls and magnetic vortices have been long since used to localize scalar and fermionic
ﬁelds [81, 82]. The localization of gauge ﬁelds is achieved either by Dvali-Shifman
mechanism [83], where conﬁning phase in the bulk is assumed, or dynamically using
ﬁeld-dependent gauge coupling constant via Ohta-Sakai mechanism [84]. Using the
former, the Standard Model gauge group has been constructed at the junction of
perpendicular domain walls in [85], while the later was used to localize large gauge
group on coincident domain walls [86, 87]. In the future, using the method devel-
oped here, we would like to construct a realistic brane-world scenario on intersecting
solitons at ﬁnite gauge coupling constant and to clarify the role of negative binding

energy on low-energy eﬀective theory.

We have shown that the spike domain wall conﬁguration in the ﬁeld theory can be
reproduced in the NG action and the DBI action. We have also observed that the DBI
action correctly realizes the semi-local boojum as the semi-local BIon. On the other
hand, as is addressed in Sec. 9.5, the DBI action cannot reproduce the semi-local
lump string itself (ES2) which is perpendicular to the domain wall. A possible reason
for this situation is that all the massless modes may not be taken into account in the
low energy eﬀective theory. The semi-local boojum is constructed by introducing a
partially degenerate masses such as (9.78). If there is a mass splitting in the ﬁrst
two components, there are three discrete vacua and an extra domain wall appears.
Associated with this, extra massless modes localize around the extra domain wall.
The extra domain wall becomes increasingly broader as the mass splitting disappears.
Correspondingly, the extra massless modes spread into the whole half-space and they
become non-normalizable. We expect that these non-nomarizable modes would be
necessary for reproducing ES2 in the low energy eﬀective theory. Normally, it is
not easy to deal with non-normalizable modes. We may achieve it by considering
a small mass splitting which introduces the broad extra domain wall. Further, we
may consider a low energy eﬀective action for the two parallel domain walls and
investigate the limit when we turn on the mass degeneracy. We leave this problem
for a future work.
