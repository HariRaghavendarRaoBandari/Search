Abstract.

We present a theoretical study of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) driven
by ultrashort optical pulses with diﬀerent kind of chirps. The goal of the present work
is perform a detailed study to clarify the relevant parameters in the chirped pulses
to achieve a noticeable cut-oﬀ extensions in HHG. These chirped pulses are generated
using both linear and nonlinear dispersive media.The description of the origin of the
physical mechanisms responsible of this extension is, however, not usually reported
with enough detail in the literature. The study of the behaviour of the harmonic cut-
oﬀ with these kind of pulses is carried out in the classical context, by the integration of
the Newton-Lorentz equation complemented with the quantum approach, based on the
integration of the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation in full dimensions (TDSE-3D).

1. Introduction

The interaction of ultra-short intense laser with atoms or molecules triggers several
nonlinear phenomena, among these, we can point out the high-order-harmonic-
generation (HHG) process [1, 2] as one of the most prominent. HHG is a well-known
phenomenon commonly used to generate coherent radiation in the range of extreme
ultraviolet (XUV) to Soft-X-Ray spectral range. A simple and intuitive way to describe
the underlying physical mechanism behind HHG in atoms and molecules, has been well
established in the so-called three-step model [3, 4, 5, 6] that can be brieﬂy summarized
as follows. In the ﬁrst step an electronic wave packet is sent to the continuum by tunnel
ionization through the potential barrier of the atom, which is a consequence of the non-
perturbative interaction between the atom and the laser electric ﬁeld. Secondly, the
emitted electronic wave packet propagates in the continuum to be ﬁnally driven back
when the laser electric ﬁeld changes its sign, and, ﬁnally, this electronic wave packet has
certain probability to recombine with the ion core, taking place the transformation of
the excess of kinetic energy in high-harmonic photons (this last step is also known as
recombination).

There exists two fundamental ways for the control of the high-harmonic radiation
emitted by atoms and molecules. We can control either the temporal evolution of the
driving electric ﬁeld-envelope and carrier frequency [7, 8], or to manipulate the spatial
properties or the driven laser ﬁeld in a broad sense, e.g. by including medium engineering
and geometric eﬀects [9, 10] or by using spatial inhomogeneous ﬁelds to drive not only
the HHG phenomenon [11, 12, 13], but also the ATI electrons [14, 15]. Related to the
carrier frequency, it is well known that one of the most important tools in the study
of the spectral characteristics of HHG is the control of the chirp in the driven laser
pulse. This is so because the HHG strongly depends on this parameter [16, 17]. It was
already established that the control and shape optimization of the driven pulse are the
main points to take into account. Another important aspect to be considered, is the
resolution and eﬃciency of the harmonic yield [16, 17, 18, 19, 20].
In some of these
works the method used to control the chirping was to achieve a suitable separation
distance between the diﬀracting gratings of the compressor. This kind of chirped pulses
is similar to the one obtained in a dispersive media and its magnitude is proportional to
the group velocity dispersion (GVD) [21]. Theoretical studies of HHG employing chirped
pulses, within the framework of the single atom model, show it is possible to extend
considerably the HHG cutoﬀ. An additional interesting feature appears: the harmonic
spectra present a clear continuum shape being the latter an essential property for the
production of isolated attosecond pulses [22, 23, 24, 25]. There is one point to emphasize,
however: the theoretically proposed chirped pulses diﬀer from the experimental ones
because the chirps are nonlinear in nature and it is not possible to achieve this kind
of pulses with only linear dispersive media. It is worth to mention that the spectral
properties of all the proposed pulses change according to the chirp parameters. This
mean that new frequency components will appear, both in the Fourier transform of the

3

pulse and in the HHG spectrum.

In this paper we discuss under which general conditions a typical femtosecond
chirped pulse, should extend the cut oﬀ the harmonic spectrum. Our model is based
on single atom simulations using the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation in full
dimensions (TDSE-3D). Related to the latter point, up to now there is not a well-
established explanation about what type of chirp and envelope are really able to produce
an extension of the HHG spectra [22, 23, 24, 25]. Note that by type of chirp we
understand the functional dependence of the carrier frequency with respect to the time.
After deﬁning this dependence, it will be possible to examine the frequency content in
the pulse analysing its inﬂuence in the HHG process. Our predictions are in agreement
with the general relationship ωcut−of f ∝ Iλ2 between the intensity, I, and wavelength
of the driven pulse, λ, and the cut oﬀ frequency, ωcut−of f , of the harmonic spectrum.
In order to eﬀectively calculate the HHG spectra driven by chirped pulses, obtained by
linear or nonlinear processes in the medium, we use them as a input in the TDSE-3D.
Following the quantum simulation, the results are compared with the classical model
showing an excellent agreement. The classical model appears to be instrumental in
order to understand the underlying physics behind the HHG cutoﬀ extension. Then
diﬀerent strategies are investigated to modify the type of chirp of the driven pulse,
mainly considering the group velocity dispersion (GVD) eﬀects and the utilization a
functional dependence of non linear character.

2. Theoretical Methods

According to the three step model [3, 4, 6] the maximum photon energy, Ecut−of f , in
the harmonic spectrum is given by the classical cut-oﬀ law,

Ecut−of f = Ip + 3.17Up

(1)

(atomic units are used throughout this paper unless otherwise stated) where Ip is the
ionization potential of the corresponding target atom or ion (in this work we will focus
on the helium atom, Ip = 0.9 a.u., i.e. 24.7 eV), ω0 is the central laser frequency and
Up is the ponderomotive energy given by:

Up =

E2
0
4ω2
0

(2)

being E0 the peak amplitude of the laser electric ﬁeld. For chirped pulses the laser pulse
frequency is time-dependent, consequently, the instantaneous ponderomotive energy is
now given by,

E(t)2
4ω(t)2

Up(t) =

(3)
In the following, and in order to avoid ambiguities, we will denote by Upo ≡ Up = E2
0
4ω2
0
the quantity reported by the equation (2) and Up(t) the one given by the equation (3).

Therefore, according to the equation (3), Up(t) will take values lower, equal or
higher than Upo for certain time intervals ∆t. In order to determine this relationship,
we will deﬁne the following function,
− ω(t)2.

∆(t) =

E(t)2
4Upo

4

(4)

According to the equation (4), if ∆(t) is negative then Up(t) < Upo. On the other hand,
if ∆(t) is positive then Upo > Up(t). Consequently, it could be expected, a priori, that
if ∆(t) is negative, the chirp induced in the pulse will be unable to extend the cut-oﬀ.
On the contrary, if ∆(t) is positive, in principle, a cut-oﬀ extension could be observed
as we will see below.

In order to complement the above described classical analysis we calculate the
harmonic spectra by numerical integration of the TDSE-3D in the length gauge within
the dipole approximation. As it is well known the harmonic yield of an atom is
proportional to the Fourier transform of the dipole acceleration of its active electron and
it can be calculated from the time propagated electronic wave function. We have used
our code which is based on an expansion in spherical harmonics, Y m
, considering only the
m = 0 terms due to the cylindrical symmetry of the problem. The numerical technique
to solve the TDSE-3D is based on a Crank-Nicolson method implemented on a splitting
of the time-evolution operator that preserves the norm of the wave function. Here we
base our studies in the helium atom due to the fact that a majority of experiments in
HHG are carried out in noble gases. Hence we have considered in our TDSE-3D code
the atomic potential reported in [26] to accurately describe the level structure of the
helium atom under the Single Active Electron (SAE) approximation. In addition, and
in order to explore the detailed spectral and temporal behaviour of HHG, we perform a
time-frequency analysis of the HHG spectra by means of a wavelet transform [27, 28, 29].

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Linear Dispersive Chirp

The ﬁrst study of HHG within this context was performed with a chirped pulse induced
by a dispersive medium. As it is well known, when an optical pulse passes through
a dispersive medium it suﬀers a temporal broadening [31]. According to the energy
conservation, the area under the pulse must remain constant. Consequently, the peak
pulse amplitude has to decrease in order to conserve the laser pulse energy.
In a
dispersive medium the spectral content of the travelling pulse is not modiﬁed during the
pulse propagation through the medium. The pulse is, however, temporally stretched.
This eﬀect can be explained in a ﬁrst approximation by expanding the temporal phase
in power series and considering the dispersive eﬀect through the GVD term [32]. This

term is deﬁned as, GVD = d2k

where τ0 is the initial FWHM. Consequently, the degree of the chirped pulse can
be expressed as a function of the product aL, whose unit is fs2 [33]. For a linear

corresponding classical energies, resulting from the integration of the Newton-Lorentz
equation, at the recombination time as a function of the ionization time (in blue) and
recombination time (in orange) (for more details see e.g [13]). The maximum photon
energy, following (1), is 189 eV (note we have put the origin in energy as the Ip value).

dispersive medium it is feasible to use an ordinary glass type where the GVD parameter
is calculated for λ = 800 nm [34]. Note that at this wavelength one laser period
corresponds to ≈ 2.6 fs. The temporary broadening is then calculated for diﬀerent
beams propagating through the dispersive medium for several pathways lengths. We
will start our analysis analysing the classical electron energy limits. Figure 1(a) shows
a driving laser pulse without chirp, i.e. GVD=0, at a laser peak intensity of 1 × 1015
W/cm2 (i.e. E0 = 0.1688 a.u.) and λ = 800 nm joint with the corresponding classical
trajectory analysis, ﬁgure 1(b), extracted by the integration of the Newton-Lorentz
equation, neglecting the eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld (for more details about the classical
simulations see e.g [13]). In ﬁgure 2 three chirped laser pulses for diﬀerent values of
aL are plotted, joint with the classical electron energy simulations. Figure 2(a) is
for aL = 26.6 fs2, ﬁgure 2(b) for aL = 53.3 fs2 and ﬁgure 2(c) for aL = 88.8 fs2,
respectively. Furthemore, ﬁgures 2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) represent the corresponding ∆(t)
functions deﬁned by equation (4). Note that in all cases the ∆(t) never takes positive
values, consequently these linear chirped pulses are not able to increase the harmonic
cut-oﬀ (see ﬁgure 1). This fact is conﬁrmed by the classical analysis as it is shown in
ﬁgures 2(g)-2(i).

Figure 2. Panels (a), (b) and (c) represent the driven chirped laser pulses for the same
laser parameters (intensity and wavelength) that in ﬁgure 1 but in this case for three
diﬀerent values of the quantity aL. The corresponding values of the ∆(t) function are
plotted in (d), (e) and (f), respectively. Following the same criterion of ﬁgure 1 panels
(g), (h) and (i) represent their respective classical analysis.

3.2. Non linear chirp

Our second analysis was performed by assuming that the driving laser pulse is given by
the following analytical form,

where E0 is the laser electric ﬁeld peak amplitude, τ0 is the FWHM, and ω0 is the central
frequency. The parameter b in equation (6) determines the degree of chirping. In this
case we assume that the pulse envelope does not change, consequently, the maximum
ﬁeld amplitude and the temporal width remain invariant in any case. In the following
we will study three particular cases of chirped pulses varying the b parameter.

In ﬁgure 3 we plot three driving laser pulses, described by the equation (6), for
diﬀerent values of b. Figure 3(a) is for b = 0.0005ω0, ﬁgure 3(b) for b = 0.001ω0 and
ﬁgure 3(c) for b = 0.0015ω0, respectively. The corresponding ∆(t) function is plotted in

ﬁgures 3(d)-(f), respectively. Note that in this case ∆(t) takes positive values for certain
temporal regions along the pulse.

panel (b) b = 0.001ω0 and panel (c) b = 0.0015ω0 respectively. Panels (d), (e) and (f)
represent the corresponding ∆(t) function for each case.

Figure 4 shows one of the key points of this work. In this ﬁgure we show that if
the b parameter increases, the pulse spectrum broaden. This spectral broadening allow
us to obtain new frequencies, lower and higher than ω0. As a consequence it will be
possible to manipulate the harmonic cut-oﬀ in agreement with the cut-oﬀ law reported
in equation (1).

Fourier Transform of the driving pulse without chirp (b = 0) is plotted in black.

In the next we will use the TDSE-3D in order to compute the harmonic spectrum
in a helium atom. In addition we will compare these quantum mechanical predictions
with classical simulations.
In ﬁgure 5(a), (b) and (c) are plotted the HHG spectra
computed with the TDSE-3D. The driven laser pulses are the ones of the ﬁgure 3.
The time-frequency analysis is shown in ﬁgures 5(d), (e) and (f), respectively. From
these ﬁgures it is possible to account the instant when the harmonics are emitted along
the laser pulse. In addition, the classical recombination energies (in solid black lines)
have been superimposed. By simple inspection of this ﬁgure it is easy to conclude that
the quantum simulations fully conﬁrm the cut-oﬀ extensions predicted by the classical
analysis.

helium atom for the three diﬀerent chirped laser pulses plotted in the ﬁgure 3. In (d),
(e) and (f) are plotted the respective time-frequency analysis, and superimposed (in
solid black lines) the classical recombination energies. The laser ﬁeld is plotted in solid
gray. Note that the ionization potential (Ip) of the target atom, in this case Ip = 24.7
eV, has been now included.

As ﬁgure 5 shows, all the cases present an increment of the harmonic cut-oﬀ in the
single atom response. Both classical and quantum analysis show an excellent degree of
accuracy and are in a complete agreement with the predictions reported by the behavior

10

of ∆(t) (ﬁgure 3). The classical analysis conﬁrms that the maximum of recombination
energy coincides with the interval in which ∆(t) is positive. Note that, however, in the
case of b = 0.0015ω0 plotted in ﬁgure 5(c), in spite of the fact that an important cut-oﬀ
enhancement is achieved, the maximum recombination energy reported by the classical
analysis, labelled by the point 1 does not generate harmonics as ﬁgure 5(c) shows. This
is so because the peak amplitude of the corresponding maximum of the ﬁeld responsible
of this recombination event, which correspond to the ﬁrst maximum at the beginning
of the laser pulse in the turn-on region, is so weak, around 0.06 a.u., i.e. 1.2 × 1014
W/cm2, to produce tunnel ionization in helium, and consequently unable to generate
harmonic radiation. To overcome this limitation we increase the peak laser intensity up
to 1.4 × 1015 W/cm2 for the case of b = 0.0015ω0 .

Figure 6. Idem ﬁgure 5(c) but in this case the peak laser intensity is 1.4×1015 W/cm2
(E0 = 0.2 a.u.) corresponding to the threshold of saturation of helium atom.

We plot these results in ﬁgure 6. On this way, it is expecting that now the peak
ﬁeld of the ﬁrst maximum mentioned above, responsible of the maximum electron
energy at recombination, turns to be intense enough to produce tunnel ionization and
consequently, harmonic radiation. This fact is depicted by the ﬁgure 6(a) where an
important cut-oﬀ extension appears in agreement by the classical predictions. Note that
the new diﬀerent plateaus generated can be understood considering that the harmonic
eﬃciency depend on λ−5.5 [36, 37]. In other words, the generation of each new plateau
can be interpreted as a result of ionization events with diﬀerent wavelengths and for
this reason the eﬃciency of the plateau in the region between 400-600 eV is so poor.

11

4. Conclusions and outlook

We have studied the behavior of the harmonic cut-oﬀ in the HHG process driving by two
diﬀerent kind of chirped laser pulses. In the ﬁrst case we employ a chirped pulse whose
spectral content has remained unaltered when it passes through a dispersive media [35].
In the second case, we have considered a chirped pulse whose frequency varies linearly in
time and its envelope remains constant. In such a pulse, and by analysing the harmonic
spectrum, it was demonstrated that, as the control chirp parameter b increases, the laser
spectrum broaden.

The eﬀect of chirped pulses on the harmonic cut-oﬀ energy obtained with a
dispersive linear media has been evaluated by a classical analysis. As can be observed
in ﬁgure 2 when the chirping of the laser pulse increases, for diﬀerent values of the
GVD, its temporal width grows and the maximum cutoﬀ photon energy diminishes.
Considering that the pulse is temporally stretched, the maximum electric ﬁeld peak
amplitude decreases. Consequently the associated drop in the laser intensity causes a
reduction of the cutoﬀ energy. On the other hand, the ∆(t) function previously deﬁned
in equation (4) provides a practical tool to predict, a priori, the behavior of the harmonic
cut-oﬀ in the case of chirped pulses.

The next study of the cut-oﬀ has been performed using the chirped pulses described
by the equation (6) and plotted in ﬁgure 3. As can be observed, these pulses have a chirp
whose frequency depends linearly in time but its temporal duration remain constant in
spite of variations of b, the parameter that controls the chirp. Analysing the behavior
of ∆(t) it is possible to correlate the increasing in the harmonic cut-oﬀ with regions in
which ∆(t) > 0. This conclusion is in perfect agreement with the simple analysis based
on the ponderomotive energy presented in Section 2.

In summary, according to the results reported here, chirping laser pulses will be
able to produce cut-oﬀ enhancements only in the case that the chirp is obtained via a
non linear process where new frequencies are generated and a broadening of the laser
spectrum is achieved [35]. In particular, lower frequencies, i.e. longer wavelengths, than
the central frequency are the ones which produce the most important cutoﬀ extensions.
This behavior can be understood based on the simple law Ecut−of f ∝ Iλ2. These
new frequencies are generated by weak laser peak amplitudes, at the turn-on region
of the driving pulse. Consequently, as an additional condition needed in order to
produce noticeable eﬀects in the HHG spectra, the input pulse have to be intense
enough to produce tunnel ionization, and consequently harmonic radiation, at the turn-
on temporal region.
