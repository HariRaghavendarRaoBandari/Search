(Dated: March 16, 2016)

The quadrupole collectivity of low-lying states and the anomalous behavior of the 0+

2 and 2+
3
levels in 72Ge are investigated via projectile multi-step Coulomb excitation with GRETINA and
CHICO-2. A total of forty six E2 and M 1 matrix elements connecting fourteen low-lying levels
were determined using the least-squares search code, gosia. Evidence for triaxiality and shape
coexistence, based on the model-independent shape invariants deduced from the Kumar-Cline sum
rule, is presented. These are interpreted using a simple two-state mixing model as well as multi-
state mixing calculations carried out within the framework of the triaxial rotor model. The results
represent a signiﬁcant milestone towards the understanding of the unusual structure of this nucleus.

The structure of low-lying states in even-even Ge iso-
topes has been the subject of intense scrutiny for many
years due to the inherent challenge of interpreting their
systematics as a function of mass A. These nuclei possess
at least one excited 0+ state in their low-energy spec-
trum that diﬀers from the ground state in its proper-
ties. Systematically, the energy of the 0+
2 level varies
parabolically with A and reaches a minimum in 72Ge,
where it becomes the ﬁrst excited state. The existence
of even-mass nuclei with a J π = 0+ ﬁrst excited state is
an uncommon phenomenon which, to date, has been ob-
served in only a few nuclei located near or at closed shells:
16O [1], 40Ca [2, 3], 68Ni [4, 5], 90Zr [6], 180,182Hg [7–9],
184,186,188,190,192,194Pb [10–15]. There are also examples
of such nuclei where a subshell appears to play a role
similar to a closed shell such as 96,98Zr [16, 17]. These
cases have all been explained as resulting from shape co-
existence due to the presence of intruder conﬁgurations;
i.e., conﬁgurations involving the excitation of at least one
pair of nucleons across a shell or subshell energy gap [18].
The structure of 72Ge is highly unusual in that this
nucleus is far from closed shells and, yet, possesses a 0+
ﬁrst excited state. It shares this distinction with only two
other known nuclei: 72Kr [19] and 98Mo [20]. It should be
noted that while 68Ni might be doubly magic [4, 21] with
a presumed subshell closure at N = 40 [22], there is no
evidence to date of spherical ground-state conﬁgurations
in any of the other N = 40 isotones [23]. There are, how-
ever, strong experimental indications of enhanced collec-
tive behavior in or near the ground states of the N = 40

neutron-rich Fe and Cr isotones [24]. In the Ge isotopes,
the absence of a subshell closure at N = 40 can be in-
ferred from the fact that the 2+
1 level with the highest
energy appears in 70Ge rather than 72Ge. Thus, under-
standing the nature and origin of this anomalous 0+
2 state
in 72Ge has been a major challenge for collective model
descriptions.

The theory of collectivity in nuclei is predominantly
focused on models with quadrupole degrees of freedom.
The simplest of these models, based on the quantization
of a liquid drop [25, 26], describes quadrupole collectiv-
ity as either due to harmonic quadrupole vibrations of
a spherical shape or to rotations and vibrations of a de-
formed quadrupole shape: a prolate or oblate spheroid or
an axially asymmetric ellipsoid. None of these variants of
nuclear collectivity possesses 0+ ﬁrst excited states. More
sophisticated models abound, for example models based
on boson degrees of freedom [27], and most notably the
interacting boson model [28], but to produce a ﬁrst ex-
cited 0+ state usually requires extreme parameter choices
ﬁtted to the nucleus under investigation. Other models
with quadrupole collectivity introduce “pair-excitations”
in an ad hoc way. These approaches are motivated by
the shape coexistence phenomena observed at and near
closed shells. These models contain parameters that are
ﬁtted to the properties of low-lying excited 0+ states,
most notably to a large pair excitation energy parameter
which is overcome by enhanced quadrupole correlations.
The latter lower the energy of the pair conﬁguration, even
to the extent that the intruder conﬁguration becomes the

ground state [29–32]. It should be noted that microscopic
collective models are now beginning to provide ﬁrst in-
sights into such structures [33].

In this letter, a detailed study of quadrupole collectiv-
ity in 72Ge by multi-step Coulomb excitation is reported.
This nucleus has been studied by Coulomb excitation in
the earlier work of Kotli´nski et al. [34]. The extended set
of E2 matrix elements obtained in the present study now
permits a model-independent view of the shapes exhib-
ited by 72Ge up to moderate spin (8). This, to the best
of our knowledge, is the most extensive set of shape in-
variants achieved for any nucleus with a ﬁrst-excited 0+
state. The deformation and asymmetry of the ground-
state band are found to be remarkably constant. The
shape invariants from the yrast and non-yrast states sup-
port an interpretation based on shape coexistence, with
the ground-state conﬁguration exhibiting a triaxial de-
formation of γ ∼ 30◦. These results are compared with
a recent version of the triaxial rotor model. It is worth
noting that the nucleus 72Ge and its neighbors have also
been the focus of detailed and varied spectroscopic in-
vestigations using multi-nucleon transfer reactions: these
are summarized with an attempt at a simple pairing oc-
cupancy picture in Ref. [18], but this picture has not been
connected to the quadrupole collective properties of the
nuclei involved.

Multi-step Coulomb excitation of the 72Ge nucleus was
carried out by bombarding a 0.5 mg/cm2-thick 208Pb tar-
get, sandwiched between a 6 µg/cm2 Al front layer and
a 40 µg/cm2 C backing, with a 301-MeV 72Ge beam de-
livered by the ATLAS facility at Argonne National Lab-
oratory. The γ rays emitted in the deexcitation were
detected with the γ-ray tracking array, GRETINA [35].
At the time of the experiment, this array consisted
of 28 highly-segmented coaxial high-purity germanium
(HPGe) crystals grouped into 7 modules. The scattered
projectile and recoiling target nuclei were detected in
kinematic coincidence with the γ rays by CHICO2, an ar-
ray of 20 position-sensitive parallel-plate avalanche coun-
ters arranged symmetrically around the beam axis [36].
CHICO2 covers 68% of the solid angle around the target
and provides a position resolution (FWHM) better than
1.6◦ in θ (polar angle) and 2.5◦ in φ (azimuthal angle)
relative to the beam axis. In addition, it achieves a time
resolution of 1.2 ns (FWHM), suﬃcient for a measure-
ment of the time-of-ﬂight diﬀerence, ∆Ttof , between the
reaction products as a function of the scattering angle,
θ. This enables an event-by-event reconstruction of the
reaction kinematics and a precise Doppler-shift correc-
tion of the γ rays. Figure 1 provides the resultant γ-
ray spectrum measured in coincidence with the scattered
72Ge projectiles. The insert depicts a two-dimensional
histogram of ∆Ttof vs. θ demonstrating the clear separa-
tion (with a mass resolution of ∆m/m ≈ 5%) between the
reaction participants. A partial scheme, incorporating all
the relevant levels populated in the present measurement,

the coupled-channel least-squares search code, gosia [38,
39], which constructs a standard χ2 function based on
comparisons between the measured γ-ray yields and the-
oretical ones calculated from an initial set of transition
and static matrix elements. Since the Coulomb cross sec-
tions depend on the relative phases as well as on the sign
and magnitude of the Eλ matrix elements (ME), a ran-
dom set of the MEs used as starting values in the χ2
search were chosen to sample all possible signs of the in-
terference term. Furthermore, all intra-band transitions
within the ground-state and quasi-γ bands as well as the
3 → 0+
2+
2 transition were assigned positive MEs. The
signs of all other MEs for the inter-band transitions were
determined relative to these, and varied during the ﬁt-
ting process to avoid being trapped in local χ2 minima.
It should be noted that the signs of these MEs, i.e., intra-
and inter-band transition matrix elements are not exper-
imental observables. In contrast, the signs of the static
or diagonal matrix elements determine whether the de-
formation is prolate (negative ME for K = 0) or oblate
(positive ME for K = 0).

In order to enhance the sensitivity to the MEs and to
exploit the dependence of the excitation probability on
the particle scattering angle, the data were partitioned
into seven angular subsets: 31◦−40◦, 41◦−50◦, 51◦−60◦,
61◦ − 70◦, 71◦ − 85◦, 96◦ − 130◦, and 131◦ − 165◦. This
resulted in a total of about 70 data points for the χ2
analysis.
In addition, known spectroscopic data such
as lifetimes, branching and E2/M 1 mixing ratios were
included as constraints of the relevant parameters dur-
ing the ﬁtting process. The ﬁnal MEs and their associ-
ated errors are displayed in Table I. For the purpose of
this discussion, only the relevant E2 MEs are tabulated,
while the E3 ME for the 3−
1 state is given here; i.e.,
(cid:104)Ii||M (E3)||If(cid:105) = 0.199(4) eb3/2. The quoted errors for
all MEs were derived in the standard way by constructing
a probability distribution in the space of ﬁtted parame-
ters and requesting the total probability to be equal to
the chosen conﬁdence limit (in this case 68.3%). These
errors include the statistical and systematic contributions
as well as those arising from cross-correlation eﬀects.

The quadrupole collectivity of the low-lying states
in 72Ge and the associated shapes can be analyzed quan-
titatively using the model-independent invariant sum
rules of Kumar [42] and Cline [43], which construct the

deformation parameters [(cid:10)Q2(cid:11), (cid:104)cos 3δ(cid:105)] from a com-

scalar products of the quadrupole operators which relate
the reduced E2 MEs to the quadrupole deformation pa-
rameters [43]. In this formalism, the parameters, Q and
δ, have correspondence to the collective model variables,

for the relevant states within the ground-state (gsb) and

that 72Ge is deformed in its ground-state band. In ad-
dition, the behavior of the asymmetry parameter [Fig. 3
(c)] is consistent with a triaxially-deformed shape for this
band. Figs. 3(b) and 3(d) provide evidence that a similar
conclusion can be drawn for the quasi-γ band as well.

Figure 4 presents the invariant sum rules analysis for
the two lowest 0+ states of 72Ge, in comparison with
those of neighboring Ge isotopes. The present and the
previous results are given with ﬁlled and open symbols,
respectively. While it is evident from Fig. 4 that a well-
deﬁned shape transition occurs when going from mass
70 to 72; i.e., the ground-state conﬁguration for 70Ge
becomes the 0+
2 excitation in 74,76Ge and vice versa for
the 0+
1 levels in the latter two nuclei, the results of the
present investigation (ﬁlled symbols) indicate a more sub-
tle transition and show that the 0+
2 states in 72Ge

have essentially the same(cid:10)Q2(cid:11) value. This is in contrast

1 and 0+

to previous investigations (see open symbols for 72Ge),
partly because of the 0+

mined here for the ﬁrst time, and found to contribute

each being associated with a diﬀerent shape. Within a
simple two-state mixing model, the 0+
2 states
can be expressed as linear combinations of two unmixed
0+
u1,u2 basis levels with diﬀerent mixing amplitudes and
unique deformations [44]. Assuming no interaction be-
tween the intrinsic states; i.e., (cid:104)Iu1||M (E2)||Iu2(cid:105) = 0,
and using the four MEs connecting the 0+
1,2 to the 2+
1,3
mixed states, the intrinsic, unmixed basis states,
ini-
tially separated by ∆int = 32 keV, are shifted by 330
keV with respect to one another by a mixing ME of 345
keV. The wavefunction of the mixed 0+
1 state contains
an amplitude cosθ0 = 0.72(3) of the unmixed ground-
state wavefunction, which indicates maximum mixing
[cos2θ0 = 0.52(4)], and is consistent with values derived
in two-neutron and alpha transfer measurements [45]. In
principle, the mixing strength can also be determined on
the basis of the known E0 monopole strength between
1 ) × 103 = 9.18(2)
the two 0+ states [ρ2(E0; 0+
in 72Ge] [46]. This would however, require knowledge
of the diﬀerence in the mean-square charge radii of the
two conﬁgurations which is at present unavailable. Thus,
while the simple two-state mixing calculations describe
the mixing between conﬁgurations of the 0+ states rea-
sonably well, ambiguities associated with the inﬂuence
of the highly-mixed 2+ “subspace” (comprising the 2+
1 ,
2+
2 , and 2+
3 states), as evidenced by the various decay
branches and magnitudes of the linking MEs (see Tab. I),
remain to be addressed. Hence, a complete description
requires, at the minimum, a three-band mixing calcula-
tion that takes into account the contributions of the 2+
states with, in addition, the inclusion of triaxiality, as
indicated by the (cid:104)cos 3δ(cid:105) analysis of Fig. 4.

scribed in the text. Limits for the various shapes are indicated
by the dashed lines.

In order to quantify the role of triaxiality and present
a better understanding of shape coexistence in the low-
lying states, a revised version of the triaxial rotor model
with independent inertia and electric quadrupole tensors
[47–51] was applied to the newly deduced E2 MEs of
72Ge. This version is a departure from the standard
use of irrotational ﬂow moments of inertia; e.g., the
Davydov-Filippov rotor model [52]. Using this model,
the E2 MEs for states within the ground and quasi-γ
bands were calculated [53] with a minimum set of as-
sumptions and compared to the experimental results.
The three model parameters required to describe the E2
MEs of a triaxial rotor include the deformation, Q0, the
asymmetry of the electric quadrupole tensor, γ, and the
mixing angle of the inertia tensor, Γ. These parame-
ters are determined analytically in this study from the
(cid:104)01||M (E2)||21(cid:105), (cid:104)01||M (E2)||22(cid:105), and (cid:104)21||M (E2)||21(cid:105)
experimental MEs (cf. Ref. [49]) and result in Q0 =
1.45 eb, γ = 27.0◦, and Γ = −23.2◦.

The results of triaxial rotor model calculations [53],
designated as (TRM), are compared with the data in
Figs. 5 and 6. For completeness, calculations for a sym-
metric rotor (Symm) and triaxial rotor with irrotational
ﬂow moments of inertia (DF) [52] are also included.

It should be noted that,
while the mean value of the shape parameter is almost
the same for these two 0+ states, it does not necessarily
follow that they are characterized by the same shape. In

fact, the identical magnitude of the (cid:10)Q2(cid:11) values can be

interpreted as a consequence of mixing of two distinct (or
unperturbed) conﬁgurations characterizing these states,

All three versions of the rotor model equally reproduce
the ground [Fig. 5(a)] and quasi-γ intra-band transitions
[Fig. 5(b)]. Beyond this point, however, the symmet-
ric rotor (Symm) has little to no value in describing
the data. For the quasi-γ to ground inter-band transi-
tions, the TRM and DF calculations appear to perform
equally well, predicting large values when the experimen-
tal values are large and likewise when they are small (see
Fig. 6). However, there is a consistent failure to repro-
duce the (cid:104)61||M (E2)||42(cid:105) and (cid:104)41||M (E2)||62(cid:105) MEs (see
indices 8 and 11 in Fig 6); these ∆I = 2, ∆K = 2 tran-
sitions have been shown to be very sensitive to interfer-
ence eﬀects [49, 51]. With the exception of the 42 state,
perhaps the most important outcome is the ability of the
TRM calculations to reproduce the static quadrupole mo-
ments; i.e., the diagonal E2 MEs (cid:104)Ii||M (E2)||Ii(cid:105). This
is presented in Figs. 5(c) and 5(d), where both the ex-
perimental (cid:104)Ii||M (E2)||Ii(cid:105) values and the general trend
with spin are in good agreement with expectations of a
triaxial rotor.

built upon it, and to determine their impact on the E2
MEs of the ground and quasi-γ bands. A simple ap-
proach was adopted to extract the model parameters
without any eﬀort to further adjust the parameters for
better agreement. This approach was to factorize the
solution into two 2 × 2 subspaces in order to solve the

∆K = 2 triaxial mixing (see above) and ∆K = 0 con-
ﬁguration mixing. Then, using the parameters from
these solutions, the E2 MEs for the full 4 × 4 space
were calculated. The ∆K = 0 conﬁguration mixing
was solved using the (cid:104)01||M (E2)||21(cid:105), (cid:104)21||M (E2)||02(cid:105),
(cid:104)01||M (E2)||23(cid:105), and (cid:104)02||M (E2)||23(cid:105) experimental MEs.
The adopted parameters for the conﬁguration mixing are
Q01 = 1.93 b, Q02 = 0.57 b, θI=0,∆K=0 = 43.2◦, and

From the ∆K = 0 conﬁguration
mixing alone, the MEs (cid:104)21||M (E2)||21(cid:105), (cid:104)23||M (E2)||23(cid:105),
and (cid:104)21||M (E2)||23(cid:105) are predicted to be 0.66, -0.28, and
-0.17 eb, respectively, but the corresponding experimen-
tal values are -0.16, -0.02, and 0.24 eb. Hence, ∆K = 0
conﬁguration mixing alone is not suﬃcient to describe
the data and suggest including ∆K = 2 triaxial mixing.

The triaxial and conﬁguration mixing solutions were
combined to give the following overall adopted param-
eters: Q01 = 1.93 b, γ1 = 27◦, and Γ1 = −23.2◦ for
the ﬁrst triaxial rotor, Q02 = 0.57 b, γ2 = 30◦, and
Γ2 = −30◦ for the second one (30◦ was assumed for sim-
plicity), and θI=0,∆K=0 = 43.2◦ and θI=2,∆K=0 = 21.1◦
for the conﬁguration mixing. This approximation scheme
results in calculated E2 MEs that are typically within a
few percent of the exact solution [54].

The results of conﬁguration mixing calculations
[54], designated as
with the two-triaxial-rotor model
(TRM×2), are compared with the experimental val-
ues in Fig. 7. The diagonal E2 MEs (cid:104)21||M (E2)||21(cid:105),
(cid:104)22||M (E2)||22(cid:105), and (cid:104)23||M (E2)||23(cid:105) (i.e., quadrupole
moments, corresponding to indices 2, 8, and 12, re-
spectively, in Fig. 7) are well described. However, the
(cid:104)21||M (E2)||23(cid:105) ME (index 5) is still not reproduced;
nor is (cid:104)22||M (E2)||23(cid:105) (index 10).
Interestingly, the
(cid:104)21||M (E2)||22(cid:105) and (cid:104)22||M (E2)||02(cid:105) MEs are predicted
well, and conﬁguration mixing substantially improves the
description of the (cid:104)21||M (E2)||02(cid:105) ME (index 3) over that
from a single triaxial rotor (see above). It can be con-
cluded that this conﬁguration mixing is well justiﬁed in
describing the E2 MEs between the 01, 02, 21, and 22
states, which can also be described with only four pa-
rameters; i.e., Q0a = 1.93 b, γa = 27◦, and Γa = −23.2◦
for the ﬁrst triaxial rotor and θI=0,∆K=0 = 43.2◦ for con-
ﬁguration mixing with an isolated 0+ state. However, the
evidence is not so compelling for the 2+
3 level. This state
could possibly be viewed as a member of a two-phonon
γ vibration, but this would necessitate the presence of
excited K = 0, 4 bands at nearly twice the energy of the
ﬁrst excited K = 2 sequence. There is at present no
evidence for this conjecture.

Finally, the sum of 2+ quadrupole moments provides
another interesting perspective on triaxiality and shape
coexistence. This sum over a complete basis or subspace
should be zero [55]. For a triaxial-rotor model, there
are only two 2+ states, whose quadrupole moments must
be equal and opposite. For 72Ge, (cid:104)21||M (E2)||21(cid:105) =
−0.16(+7−2) and (cid:104)22||M (E2)||22(cid:105) = 0.179(+3−6), yielding
a sum of 0.02(+8−6).
If the sum is made over the
three 2+ states observed in the present study, where
(cid:104)23||M (E2)||23(cid:105) = −0.02(+2−14), the result is 0.00(+8−15).
Assuming that the 2+
3 state is part of a second triax-
ial rotor conﬁguration, there must then be another 2+
level with a diagonal E2 ME equal to 0.00(+8−15), con-
sistent with γ2 = 30◦.
It can thus be concluded that

6

the quadrupole moment sum is consistent with shape co-
existence between two triaxial structures, but it is also
consistent with other scenarios; e.g., shape coexistence
between triaxial and spherical structures. It can also be
argued, based on the magnitude and the general pattern
of the MEs linking the 2+
3 level to the lower-lying states,
that this state may not be directly associated with the 0+
2
level, as has often been assumed. In fact, the TRM cal-
culations account for only ∼ 32% of the measured B(E2)
value for this state. The introduction of gamma softness,
perhaps resulting from a two-phonon character, may be
required to account for the remaining strength. Further
work will be required to clarify this issue.

1 and 0+

In summary, the collective properties of the ground-
state and quasi-γ bands as well as the ﬁrst excited 0+
and 2+
3 states in 72Ge have been investigated in a model-
independent way using sub-barrier multi-step Coulomb
excitation. The model-independent shape invariants ob-
tained from the Kumar-Cline sum rule analysis of the
low-spin structure provide compelling evidence for the
coexistence of two triaxially-deformed conﬁgurations as-
sociated with the 0+
2 states. Within a two-state
mixing model, the extracted matrix elements agree with
this shape coexistence interpretation, but also require
maximum mixing between the wavefunctions of the ﬁrst
two 0+ states. The results of multi-state mixing calcu-
lations performed within the framework of the triaxial
rotor model demonstrate the importance of the triaxial
degree of freedom and indicate that the low-spin struc-
ture of 72Ge can be adequately described by mixing of
two triaxial rotors. This result reveals that a nucleus,
apparently unlike any other known collective one, pos-
sesses a simple underlying structure. This interpreta-
tion, by way of coexistence of diﬀerent shapes, supports
structural simplicity when the phenomenology appears
complex.
