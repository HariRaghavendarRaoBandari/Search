A geodesic model in conformal superspace.

Abstract

Following [1], I look for the most general geometrodynamical symmetries compatible with spatial
relational principles. I argue that they lead either to a completely static Universe, or one embodying
spatial conformal diﬀeomorphisms. Demanding locality for an action compatible with these principles
severely limits its form, both for the gravitational part as well as all matter couplings. The simplest
and most natural choice for pure gravity has two propagating physical degrees of freedom (and no
refoliation-invariance). The system has a geometric interpretation as a geodesic model in inﬁnite
dimensional conformal superspace. Conformal superspace is a stratiﬁed manifold, with diﬀerent
strata corresponding to diﬀerent isometry groups. Choosing space to be (homeomorphic to) S3,
conformal superspace has a preferred stratum with maximal stabilizer group. This stratum consists
of a single point – corresponding to the conformal geometry of the round 3-sphere. This is the most
homogeneous non-degenerate geometry. The path integral transition amplitude from this special
initial condition deﬁnes a unique, static, wave-functional over conformal superspace. This and the
lack of refoliation invariance allow me to implement an unusual sort of gauge-ﬁxing: given the initial
representative of the gauge orbit, it ﬁxes the path velocities to be parallel propagated, i.e.
it ﬁxes
a horizontal lift for each path in the principal ﬁber bundle as opposed to a section of the principal
ﬁber bundle, as is usually done. This facilitates the writing of the Fadeev-Popov determinant for our
system and its BRST symmetries, and completely determines the gauge-ﬁxed path integral, which
can be shown to be Weyl-anomaly free.

1 Introduction

In a previous paper, [1], I described properties of a general relational theory in the conﬁguration space
Q = {φ}. Starting from an action for paths in conﬁguration space, S[φ(t)], I deﬁned a single static
wave-function, ψ[φ], given by the path integral transition from a preferred conﬁguration – the most

homogeneous one, φ∗ – to any other, i.e. ψ[φ] =(cid:82) Dφ(t) exp [i S[φ(t)]/], with φ(0) = φ∗ and φ(1) = φ.

I found that even in the absence of an explicit time variable, one could extract a notion of time from
structures of the wavefunction itself. I called such structures “records”.

The most interesting property of a conﬁguration holding a record is that its Born probability becomes
a conditional probability, conditional on the conﬁguration representing the record. It is as if that record
really “happened”, even in a timeless Universe.

In [2], I used the structures introduced in [1] to discuss a dynamical origin for locality. It is notoriously
diﬃcult to disentangle locality from theories that possess gauge degrees of freedom, and general relativity
has an honorable tradition in this respect [3].
I proposed criteria that would determine locality of
subsystems from properties of solution curves in conﬁguration space.

However, the mechanisms discussed in [2] were not viable for theories that possessed refoliation
invariance, such as ADM gravity [4]. Moreover, I used tools that required the action of the theory to
be of Jacobi-type, i.e. expressible as a distance functional in conﬁguration space. I did not provide an
example of a theory that would satisfy all of those criteria in either paper.

Here I close this gap, by providing a theory that satisﬁes the following conditions: i) it is completely
spatially relational. This in turn is shown to require for a gravitational theory (in metric variables) ii)
conformal diﬀeomorphism symmetry. The simplest form of the theory has exactly the interpretation of
iii) being of Jacobi type, a theory about geodesics in conformal superspace – the physical quotient space

(conﬁguration space quotiented by the symmetries) . Lastly, one can use the structure of conformal
superspace to establish a unique preferred orbit. This is, in a very precise sense, the most homogeneous
of all conﬁgurations, and it serves to establish iv) a preferred initial point in the path integral kernel,
φ∗ = g∗.

I will furthermore employ a principal ﬁber bundle view of the theory. The path integral is then a
summation over all paths in the physical quotient space (conﬁguration space quotiented by the symme-
tries). The interesting thing about this formulation is that we don’t have to provide a section of the
bundle, as is usually done. I.e. we, don’t have to provide a unique representative for each orbit. We
only have to provide a unique path in conﬁguration space for each path in the physical quotient space.
This allows us to introduce a diﬀerent type of gauge-ﬁxing, corresponding to a unique way of lifting the
curves from physical space to conﬁguration space.

This novel type of gauge-ﬁxing for gravitational theories without refoliation invariance will then allow
me to write a nice local form for the gauge-ﬁxed path integral, with on-shell BRST invariance. It should
be stressed it is enormously diﬃcult to ﬁnd an explicit BRST invariant form for the gauge-ﬁxed path
integral of ADM gravity, because the constraints do not form a Lie algebra, unlike what is the case here.

2 The most general Lagrangian action

Basic structure of Riem.
In the present context, I will let M denote a spatial, closed (i.e. compact
without boundary) 3-dimensional manifold. For the non-relativistic gravitational systems in considera-
tion here, I will take conﬁguration space to be the space Riem(M ), of positive-deﬁnite sections of the
+ (T ∗M ⊗S T ∗M ) over M , which forms a subspace (a cone) of the
symmetric covariant tensor bundle C∞
Banach vector space B := C∞(T ∗M ⊗S T ∗M ).1 This subspace has a one-parameter family of natural
Riemannian structures, induced pointwise by the metric gab:

f ∈ D(M ), act on the metric through pull-back, f∗g(x) = g(f (x)), with an inﬁnitesimal action given by
t g) = Lξg, where f0 =Id. The orbits of the

2.1 Finding the most general symmetries compatible with our framework.

If one takes conﬁguration space to be fundamental, one must consider symmetries that act intrinsi-
cally on it. Here, I will argue that the most general such symmetries are conformal diﬀeomorphism
transformations.

To ﬁnd them, we ﬁrst look at the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld associated to a smeared functional F [g, π, λ],
polynomial in its variables. For the associated symmetry to have an action on conﬁguration space that
is independent of the momenta, F [g, π, λ] must be linear in the momenta. This already severely restricts
the forms of the functional to

F [g, π, λ] =

so that

ﬁrst class constraint).

it must be a

1Here I have chosen the degree of diﬀerentiability to be inﬁnity, i.e. smooth functions. However, it is well-known that in
this case the space of sections above will form instead an inverse limit Banach manifold (Hilbert, once we have introduced
a complete metric) by the Sobolev construction. One could instead suppose that we have a high but ﬁnite degree of
diﬀerentiability, but I will ignore these more technical obstructions here, assuming they do not interfere with what I would
like to achieve. For more on these matters, see [5, 6, 7].

2

Let us for now assume that F1(g, λ)ab is covariant tensor of rank two. This possibly requires integrat-
ing away covariant derivatives from πab. If F1 has no derivatives of the metric, it will straightforwardly
commute. But with no derivatives the only objects we can form are:

F1(g, λ)ab = λgab , and F1(g, λ)ab = λabgab

In the ﬁrst case, these are just conformal transformations, in the second, they would imply that πab = 0,
a constraint killing any possibility of dynamics.

Suppose F1 is a tensor with two or more derivatives of the metric. For example,

F1(g, λ)ab = λ(αRab + βRgab)

The algebra of equation (3) does not close for any values of α and β. If one instead chose a term of
the form βRλab one can show that the rank of this constraint is not constant along phase space, and it
would imply that πab = 0 almost everywhere, as before. The conjecture is that these conclusions hold
order by order in number of derivatives of the metric.
Similarly, one can show that taking (2) to contain covariant derivatives of πab, with terms for example
of the form λ∇aR∇bπab, only the momentum constraint, generator of diﬀeomorphisms, λa∇bπab survives
as the generators of a closed algebra [8]. 2

Thus, I will take gauge symmetries in Riem(M ) to be conformal diﬀeomorphism transformations.

2.2 The form of the Lagrangian

To calculate the possible form of the Lagrangian for this theory, we perform the following calculation.

To start the calculation, we note that if the 3-metric gab has conformal weight 4, i.e.δgab = e4gab,
the symmetric 2-tensor ˙gab, also has conformal weight 4, and the undensitized totally anti-symmetric
3-tensor abc has conformal weight −6.

Thus, as a necessary condition to have a conformal diﬀeomorphism invariant action, we must match

the following tensor indices and conformal weights:

− 3N + 2N ˙g + 2Ng − 2Ng−1 + N∇ = 0
−3N + 2N ˙g + 2Ng − 2Ng−1 = −3

⇒ N∇ = −3

(4)

(5)

It turns out that the only polynomial invariant we can form with three derivatives of the metric is the
Chern-Simons functional [9],

CS[g] =

d3x(dΓ ∧ Γ +

3

Γ3)

(6)

(cid:90)

where Γ(gab) is the Levi-Civita connection one form associated to gab.

Since CS[g] is a conformal diﬀeomorphism invariant, From functionally diﬀerentiating it, we obtain

the symmetric tensor:

δCS[g]

where the (undensitized) Cotton tensor is deﬁned as:

C ab := acd∇c

where here we are using the undensitized totally anti-symmetric pseudo-tensor abc.
Since it is a functional derivative of a conformal diﬀeomorhism invariant functional, under an in-
ﬁnitesimal diﬀeomorhism δξgab = Lξgab, or inﬁnitesimal conformal transformation, δρgab = ρgab, it must
remain invariant. Thus besides being symmetric, we obtain equations telling us that the Cotton tensor
is also transverse and traceless:

C ab = C (ab)

, C ab

;b = 0 , C a

a = 0

(8)

2In fact, the constraint (∇2 − 1

8 R)π = 0 can also survive. This is the conformal Laplacian in 3-dimensions acting on
the trace of the momentum (which is a conformally invariant scalar density). By exploring conformal transformations one
can show that this reduces to the conformal constraint π = 0 almost everywhere on phase space as well [8].

we get C ab → e−10ρC ab.

The Cotton is the unique tensor which transforms covariantly under conformal diﬀeomorphism in
3-dimensions, and its determination completely speciﬁes the conformal geometry of a metric. With it,

Overall, it contains 3 powers of spatial derivatives (6/2). A derivative expansion into higher orders is

The transformations of ξa and ρ Under a time dependent diﬀeomorphism, f∗

ξa → ˙va − [ξ, v]a

and ρ → ˙θ − ξa∂aθ

(12)

where va is the vector ﬁeld ﬂow of ft at t = 0 and f0 =Id. Thus, ξa and ρ transform in a manner to
cancel the extra terms, in the transformations
˙gcd → L ˙vgcd + Lvgcd

Lξgcd → L ˙vgcd − L[ξ,v]gcd + LξLvgcd = L ˙vgcd + LvLξgcd

thus

( ˙gcd − (Lξg)cd − ρgcd) → θLv( ˙gcd − (Lξg)cd − ρgcd)

which means that this combination transforms covariantly wrt to conformal diﬀeomorphisms.

In the path integral formalism, ˙v and ˙ρ are absorbed by a ﬁeld redeﬁnition of the Lagrange multipliers.

The equations of motion of ξa and ρ are:

form a Lie algebra, as we show below in (20).

2.3 Coupling to matter

The coupling of matter is an important issue in the conformal geodesic model. However, it is too
complicated an issue to be discussed to completion here. I leave a devoted study for the near future.
pσ, we would like to have a representation of the diﬀeomorphism constraints of the sort pσLξσ.

Since we want diﬀeomorphisms to act universally, for extra ﬁelds and their conjugate momenta σ,

The solution employed by York et al. [10] and Isenberg et al [11] for the conformal weight of extra
matter ﬁelds, was to make them zero. That is, the extra ﬁelds are then only carried along by the
transformations of the metric. This automatically makes the usual Yang-Mills Lagrangian conformally
covariant at least.3
For (possibly Lie-algebra valued) one forms Aa, we need to have anti-symmetry in spatial derivatives,
as in ∇[aAb]∇[aAb], so that the corresponding term can be conformally covariant. Let the conjugate
density to Aa be Eb, for which we deﬁne the undensitized ¯Eb√
g = Eb. These are the ﬁelds that are
required to be conformally invariant. In this case the Gauss constraint doen’t require a compensating
ﬁeld for the conformal transformation since
g∇a ¯Ea =

g ¯Ea) = ∂aEa

Following the usual recipe, the conformally invariant Hamiltonian for this ﬁeld becomes:4:

3 Yet another possibility is to resurrect Weyl’s notion of conformal potential to correct for derivatives of the conformal
factor [12]. In our present case, this would change the analysis through the introduction of another ﬁeld – the one Weyl
tried to identify with the electromagnetic potential. The introduction of this ﬁeld would however also allow for a diﬀerent
set of vacuum Lagrangians.

where αv, βv are coupling constants. Equation (22) would indicate that the Yang-Mills ﬁelds ﬁts rather
nicely with our formalism. The terms in the Hamiltonian are the most natural conformally covariant
ones, fortuitously appearing with the same conformal weight, and the Gauss constraint is also singled out
by this requirement. We see that conformal covariance and requiring the two terms in the Hamiltonian
to have the same weight requires some sort of relativity principle – we could only match even powers of
E with even powers of the anti-symmetrized ∇A. However, as we will note below, this is not compatible
with the related energy-momentum tensor sourcing the metric equations of motion.

For considerations about the energy-momentum tensor in the forthcoming, we now calculate the

Given the possible conformal weights, we need to classify the types of matter potentials and kinetic
terms according to the analogous equations (4) and (5). In an eﬀective ﬁeld theory framework, we need
to add all the terms compatible with the symmetries, which would include more complicated derivative
couplings.5 These are all interesting questions, and there seems to be a lot of room for phenomenological
study of this dynamical hierarchy, which is all left for the future. In appendix C we give a preliminary
study of the issues that might arise with simple couplings for matter at a conformally ﬂat limit.

where Cab is the Cotton-York tensor, deﬁned in (7). To stress, this is a fully conformal diﬀeomorphism
invariant action with the same physical degrees of freedom as general relativity, but which does not have
local refoliation invariance. This is our initial starting point, but now we will ﬁnd a better suited action
for writing the gauge-ﬁxed path integral, in (42), below, using the notion of horizontal lift.

3.1 Path integral for SE

Gauge-ﬁxings for SE Now we implement the Fadeev-Popov determinant with a gauge variation of
˙gab, keeping the base point gab ﬁxed, i.e. we implement a gauge-ﬁxing only of the metric velocities. That
is, considering the transformations (12), we will gauge ﬁx ˙va and ˙θ. The way to implement this is to ﬁnd
gauge-ﬁxings that are spatially covariant (i.e. under diﬀeomorphisms which are constant in time).

The gauge-ﬁxings, given through:

5In the asymptotic safety scenario, it is shown that more general non-derivative couplings are generated through the

renormalization group ﬂow of minimal coupling terms with the Einstein-Hilbert action [13].

The former has an inﬁnitesimal gauge variation that just sets 3ρ = ˙g. The latter is also covariant at each
t, and thus won’t gauge-ﬁx the spatial diﬀeomorphisms which are constant in time (alternatively, at one
instant in time). According to (12), we have, for the time-dependent diﬀeomorphisms:

Arc-length parametrization Equation (26) is an energy functional in Riem with just one global
lapse and thus one global notion of time. Its extrema give arc-length parametrized geodesics wrt the
conformal syupermetric (60). If we also want reparametrization invariance, we arrive at the conformal-
diﬀeomorphism invariant geodesic action (as opposed to the energy action, (26)):

Then, we still need to gauge-ﬁx the time-reparametrizations, which we choose to be an arc-length

one:

Gt :=

C abCab ( ˙gcd(t) ˙gcd(t)) − 1 = 0

Gt = ||

C abCab ( ˙gcd ˙gcd) − 1

which gives the variation:

δGt
δ |Gt=0

= ±1

(35)

This gauge choice is responsible for the absence of the global square root in (36), below.

In other words, with this gauge choice one can express the action as an energy functional (in the

Riemannian geometry sense) as opposed to a length functional:

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

ds(cid:107) ˙g(cid:107)2 as opposed to

ds(cid:107) ˙g(cid:107)

The main feature however of the energy functional is that extremals wrt it automatically implement arc-
length parametrization as one of the extremum conditions. In other words, since the length and energy
functional coincide for arc-length parametrization, and this is implied by the extrema of the energy
functional, in the semi-classical approximation one can directly use the energy functional as opposed to
the length. In a way, this gauge ﬁxing ‘trades’ global time reparametrization invariance for locality of
the action functional.

free ﬁeld. The term with the Lagrange multiplier Y a
T implements the gauge-ﬁxing (28). The Jacobian
determinants for the traceless part of the two real vector ﬁelds contribute with a Det(∆), while the those

3.2 Path integral for the horizontal lift action

Horizontal lift For metrics without conformal Killing vector ﬁelds, the equations of motion for the
Lagrange multipliers, (15) and (16), have unique solutions.
In appendix A, I give the geometrical

retaining the conformal diﬀeomorphism invariance properties of (9).

appendix A, for a principal ﬁber bundle (even an inﬁnite-dimensional one), given a path [γ(t)] on the
base manifold P/G, through any point p ∈ P , [γ(t)] will have a unique horizontal lift γ H(t) in P . We
can restrict integration to be over horizontal paths through the use of a delta function, which gives a
preferred gauge-ﬁxing, after we have implemented the equations of motion of ξa in the action.

To implement the equations of motion for ξa directly in the action, we could add a further functional

Dirac delta, δ(G(ξ)), where

(40)

The inclusion of this term is diﬀerent than the inclusion of a gauge-ﬁxing with the corresponding Fadeev-

The new term guarantees that the corrected metric velocities become horizontal, ˙gab → ˙gH

to (64) and (61) in the appendix). However, a new determinant Det(∆)1/2 appears, since we now have
three transverse vector ﬁelds.

(43)

Taking into account the gauge-ﬁxing of the divergence of the metric velocitites, (28), we get that
the vertical corrections to ˙gab vanish for metrics that have no conformal Killing vector ﬁelds, and thus
ab → ˙gab. Finally, in the absence of conformal Killing vector ﬁelds, we have that on the gauge-ﬁxing

which is of the same form as (38), but with O → ∆.

The over-counting of gauge-equivalent orbits in this case would come only from integration over Df1,
for which a gauge-ﬁxing would indeed be necessary. That is because due to the use of horizontal paths,
the integration over Df2 does not overcount gauge-equivalent paths.
In other words, for each initial
metric g1 there is a one to one relation between horizontal paths in Riem and paths in the quotient
space, Riem/Diﬀ (cid:110) C(M ).
Furthermore, as that remaining gauge-ﬁxing of Diﬀ (cid:110)C(M ) is required only for initial conditions, we
will leave it to be a priori ﬁxed, i.e. g1 is the initial “ background”. I.e., we will form a mixed kernel
K(g1, [g2]).

Since the diﬀeomorphism connection will have associated gauge-curvature [5], horizontal paths de-
parting from g1 might not all reach the same point along the orbit of [g2] (they will acquire some
‘holonomy’). If they did all reach the same horizontal lift of [g2], the integration over Df2 would factor
out. However, it can be shown that the connection form for the conformal transformations in Riem is
indeed ﬂat, thus there is no need to integrate over the conformal orbit, which is the reason we integrate
over f2 ∈ SDiﬀ and not f2 ∈ Diﬀ (cid:110) C(M ).

Lastly, there are no Weyl anomalies, since for the Lagrangian (17) (and the respective gauge-ﬁxed
path integral (36)) Weyl transformations only act on the 3-metric and no other parameter, and there are
no Weyl anomalies in three-dimensions.

In appendix B I also explore the more standard ‘t Hooft gauge, which has advantages and disadvan-

tages.

3.3 BRST treatment

BRST transformations
divergence-free vector-valued ghost ﬁelds, and ρ, λ scalar ghost ﬁelds, all of them time-dependent.

In this section, to avoid confusion with the notation, let ηa, ζ a denote

The distinguishing fact that we use here is that the BRST symmetries will act on histories, or paths,

rather than on just the ﬁeld variables themselves. Then the BRST transformations are:

δBgab(t) = Lηgab(t) + ρgab(t)

;

δBgab(t) = Lηgab(t) − ρgab(t)

;

T = [η, YT]a
δBY a
T = [η, XT]a − ζ a
;

δBZ a

δBρ = ηa∂aρ ;

δBηa =
δB ˙gab(t) = Lη ˙gab(t) + ρ ˙gab(t) + Lζgab(t) + λgab(t)

δBλ = ηa∂aλ ;

1
2
;

[η, η]a

;

δBX a

(46)
where Lηgab(t) = −∇(aηb) (there is an opposite sign in the inverse metric Lie derivative formula), and
the barred variables follow suit.

δBζ a = [η, ζ]a

T = [η, ZT]a

The ﬁelds ζ a and λ play the role of the time derivatives of ηa and ρ and their equations follow the
transformation rules in (12). They could be obtained indirectly, from the commutation property of the
BRST diﬀerential with the time derivative:

δBζ a = δB

dηa
dt

=

d
dt

δBηa =

1
2

([η, ζ]a + [ζ, η]a) = [η, ζ]a with ζ a =

dηa
dt

(47)

This is also the case for the transformation of ˙gab in (46).7

Now, δ2

B can be see to vanish when acting on ηa due to the Jacobi identity. On ρ we have

δ2
Bρ =

1
2

[η, η]a∂aρ + ηa∂a(ηb∂bρ)

which vanishes since [η, η]a = 2ηb∂bηa and ηaηb∂a∂bρ = 0 due to anti-symmetry.

For the metric we have:

δ2
Bgab =

1
2

L[η,η]gab + ηa∂aρ gab − Lη(Lηgab + ρ gab) − ρ(Lηgab + ρ gab)

7An alternative way of seeing that this is the correct transformation of ˙gab is to think of a two-parameter family of
diﬀeomorphisms acting on the metric: F (t, s)∗gab(t). Here t parametrizes the path, but s is an independent variable, which
we can take to zero to ﬁnd the inﬁntesimal form of diﬀeomorphisms. We then have:

(cid:18) d

d
dt

(cid:19)

(cid:0)Lξs(t)gab(t)(cid:1) = L ˙ξs(t)gab(t) + Lξs(t) ˙gab(t)

=

where ξa(t)s is a one-parameter family of time-dependent spatial vector ﬁelds, for the ﬁxed parameter s.

2L[η,η]gab. The
this vanishes since:i) ρρ = 0 ,
actions on ˙gab and on the other time derivatives of the ﬁelds necessarily vanish from (47) and the
constituent transformations.

ii), Lη(ρ gab) = ηa∂aρgab − ρLηgab and iii) LηLηgab = 1

To see it directly, we require the Jacobi identity for Lie superalgebras. We have that, for ghost

number one ﬁelds, x, y:

Thus, for example, for δ2

Bζ a:

[x, [y, z]] = [[x, y], z] − [y, [x, z]]

δB(δBζ a) = δB([η, ζ]a) =

[[η, η], ζ]a − [η, [η, ζ]]a = 0

1
2

since from (48), for x = y = ηa, and z = ζ a:

The same calculation follows for the transformations of Z a and Y a.8

2[η, [η, ζ]]a = [[η, η], ζ]a

(48)

(49)

T receives a correction due to the time derivative of η. Let’s

Notice also that the transformation of X a
check that this is consistent with nilpotency:
T = δB([η, XT]a − ζ a) =

δ2
BX a

again by a calculation similar to (49).

[[η, η], XT] − [η, [η, XT] − ζ] − [η, ζ] = 0

BRST symmetry for δ gauge ﬁxing Our gauge-ﬁxing only explicitly gauge-ﬁxes the symmetry
related to ζ a and λ. The remainder symmetry corresponds to a rigid vertical translation of the path
gab(t), and is gauge-ﬁxed by an arbitrary choice of the initial metric. This initial metric is an input,
ab, which ﬁxes
which goes into the form of the kernel (36).
η(0) = 0 = ρ(0) (as there is no gauge-symmetry acting on that initial background), we can integrate ζ a
and λ in time in (47) to obtain ηa and ρ.

In other words, having ﬁxed gab(0) = go

After taking the trace (coming from ρgab) and integrating by parts the only term left is then a total

We will from here on, ignore the pure trace variations, as all vector ﬁelds are divergence free and

would contract to zero. Given this simpliﬁcation, let us notice that:

(52)
This is what we want: all terms to have a variation which matches the action of Lη. This will allow us
to form a total derivative by the Leibnitz rule.

δB(Lζgab) = (L[η,ζ] − LζLη)gab = Lη(Lζgab)

8Note that the manner in which I wrote the super Jacobi identity, (48) doesn’t depend on the parity of z. The full form

for general grading is: [x, [y, z]] = [[x, y], z] − (−1)|x||y|[y, [x, z]].

ab − LξT gab)) = Lη ˙gT

(53)

This is half of the kinetic term, which is symmetric, and also resolves the horizontal lift term (combined
with the transformation property of Z a). So far so good. We are only left with the δ gauge-ﬁxing term.
However, using the same tricks we now ﬁnd that:

(54)

(55)

In fact, with a little foresight we could have predicted this would be the only leftover term: except for the
gauge-ﬁxing term and the ghost term in (50), the Lagrangian is classically diﬀeo-conformal invariant, and
thus its BRST variation would have had to vanish. The ghost term is easily seen to be diﬀeomorphism
and conformally invariant, and even the gauge-ﬁxing term is clearly invariant under time-independent
gauge transformations. Thus the only term left to check is the one that emerges from time dependent
gauge transformations.

Integration by parts away from the Lagrange multiplier in (55) tells us that this is generically zero
only if the gauge-ﬁxing equation (31) is satisﬁed. This means that this type of gauge-ﬁxing only yields
a fully BRST-invariant gauge-ﬁxed path integral on the gauge-ﬁxing surface (all BRST variations must
be performed before projection to the gauge-ﬁxing surface of course), i.e.

(δB£)|δ(Gdiff)

= 0

Thus the resulting path integral from the horizontal lift (45) is an extremely nice, local, gauge-ﬁxed
path integral with on-shell BRST invariance and no Weyl anomaly. In appendix B, we use the more
standard gauge-ﬁxing through the use of ‘t Hooft’s trick (i.e. through the use of the Nakanishi-Laudrup
method), which is more suited to prove BRST invariance.

3.4 Semi-classical treatment, and preferred ‘in’ state.

Perturbation theory In fact, for theories that have preferred foliations, a similar gauge-ﬁxing of the
path integral is performed in [15]. There, one chooses gauge-ﬁxings of the space-time diﬀeomorphisms
only through gauge-ﬁxings of the perturbations of the lapse and shift, not for the metric and its pertur-
bations. That is also what is being done here: conditions on the propagation of coordinates are being
chosen, rather than the coordinates themselves. The gauge-ﬁxing terms become much simpliﬁed, as one
can have just terms that set the perturbations of the shift to zero for example, as opposed to choosing
e.g. harmonic coordinate conditions for the full perturbations of the metric tensor.

To actually perform calculations for perturbation theory, we need to ﬁnd a background of all the
ﬁelds (including Lagrange multipliers if there are any), and then perform the second variation of the
gauge-ﬁxed action. We will perform these calculations in an upcoming paper.

The other advantage of the horizontal gauge-ﬁxing is that it is easily generalizable to the semi-classical

approximation. The standard semi-classical approximation applies here:
(∆γcl)1/2 exp (iS(γcl)/)

ab, gab) = A

Kcl(g∗

where A is a normalization factor (independent of the initial and ﬁnal conﬁgurations),9 and the Van
Vleck determinant is now deﬁned as

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

∆γcl := det

− δ2S(γcl)
δg∗

ab(x)δgab(y)

(56)

(57)

where we here write the action as a functional of its initial and ﬁnal points along γcl.

Of course, without the gauge-ﬁxing, (57) would be zero, due to the existence of degenerate directions.
However, it is easy to show that extremal paths that begin horizontally, stay horizontal. The reason
is that vertical velocity is conserved along geodesics, since the vertical directions are Killing in the
supermetric of conﬁguration space.

All that is left for us to determine is the ‘preferred in’ conﬁguration φ∗, we now turn to this.
9In a ﬁnite-dimensional dynamical system of dimension d, this takes the form of the phase space volume occupied by a

quantum state: A = (2π)−d.

12

The preferred conﬁguration g∗. To have a static wave-function over conﬁguration space, as per the
construction of [1], we require a preferred ‘in’ conﬁguration, g∗ to be inserted in the path integral kernel
(45). When the action has gauge symmetries, one should replace ‘preferred conﬁguration’ for ‘preferred
gauge orbit’. Here, I will make clear in which sense this orbit is special.

Reduced gravitational conﬁguration spaces may not form smooth manifolds, but only stratiﬁed man-
ifolds. This is because the symmetry group in question may act qualitatively diﬀerently on diﬀerent
orbits. Let us take the diﬀeomorphism group Diﬀ(M ), acting on the metrics through pull-back f∗gab,
f ∈Diﬀ(M ). For metrics that have non-trivial isometry groups, Ig ∈ Diﬀ(M ), i.e. that have a non-trivial
isometry group, we have a degenerate action of the diﬀeomorphism group. For this reason, taking the
quotient of the space of metrics over M , Riem(M ), wrt the diﬀeomorphisms creates a structure with
diﬀerent strata.

Stratiﬁed manifolds have nested “corners” – each stratum corresponds to a dimension of the stabilizer
group, and has as boundaries a lesser dimensional stratum. The larger the stabilizer group, the lower
the strata. Let Mo be the set of metrics without isometries. This is a dense and open subset of M,
the space of smooth metrics over M . Let In be the isometry group of the metrics gn, such that the
dimension of In is dn. Then the quotient space of metrics with isometry group In forms a manifold with
boundaries, Mn/Diﬀ(M ) = Sn. The boundary of Sn decomposes into the union of Sn(cid:48) for n(cid:48) > n (see
[16]). A useful picture to have in mind for this structure is a cube (seen as a manifold with boundaries).
The interior of the cube has boundaries which decomposes into faces, whose boundaries decompose into
lines, whose boundaries decompose into points.
Conﬁgurations with the highest possible dimension of the stabilizer subgroup are what I deﬁne as
φ∗ – they are the pointiest, and simplest, corners of reduced conﬁguration space. It is these preferred
singular points of conﬁguration space that I deﬁne as an origin of the transition amplitude.

Thus, depending on the symmetries acting of conﬁguration space, and on the topology of M , one
can have diﬀerent such preferred conﬁgurations. For the case at hand – in which we have both scale and
diﬀeomorphism symmetry and M = S3– there exists a unique such preferred point. The preferred g∗ of
M/(Diﬀ(M ) (cid:110) C) is the one corresponding to the round sphere.10
We thus deﬁne a static, universal wave-function over M/(Diﬀ(M ) (cid:110) C) as ψ(g) := K(go, [g]), where
go is the round sphere and K(go, [g]) is given by (45). The probability is given by the Born rule,
P ([g]) = |ψ([g])|2.

4 Summary and conclusions

Starting from quite general, relational ﬁrst principles, we were led to construct a unique, simple theory,
which: i) has a geometric interpretation, as required by the results of [2], ii) shows BRST invariance, iii)
has diﬀerent number of spatial and time derivatives for the metric ﬁelds, iv) has a unique prescription
for matter couplings, and v) picks out its own initial conﬁguration, yielding a static wave-function
over conﬁguration space, as required in [1]. Regarding the matter couplings, we also found that these
requirements force upon us the usual Lorentz invariant form for Yang-Mills ﬁelds.11

Construction The initial aim of this paper was to investigate to which extent spatially relational
principles, delineated in [1], determined a theory. I found that indeed, the principles almost fully deter-
mine the possible symmetry content for gravitational theories (when expressed in metric variables). The
theories should be conformal and diﬀeomorphism invariant. This was the ﬁrst result of this paper.

As a by-product, we get access to the very interesting properties of conformal superpsace – the
physical quotient space determined by the symmetry content. This is a stratiﬁed manifold, and for the
topology of S3, which we take to be the topology of the Universe, it has a preferred such stratum, and
it corresponds uniquely to the geometry of the round 3-sphere. This can be input into the deﬁnition of
the static wave-function over conﬁguration space, Ψ[g] = K(go, g), as in [1].12

10For this analysis I assumed that no degenerate metrics are allowed. If they are allowed, then the analysis diﬀers. The
completely degenerate metric would be a natural candidate in this extended conﬁguration space, as it possesses the full
group of diﬀeomorphisms as a stabilizer. However, it is not clear that the completely degenerate metric is even represented
in reduced conﬁguration space. In this last case, one would not have one, but a multitude of possible g∗’s. This would
make the choice of g∗ a largely arbitrary choice, weakening the case made in this paper.

11However, as remarked in the last section of these conclusions, phenomenological Lorentz invariance is a more compli-
cated issue, since duration, as opposed to the path parametrization t, is a notion to be abstracted from change. If matter
couplings come with the same anisotropy as space-time, this would not be perceived as Lorentz violations.

12Of course, as we deﬁne in the text, what we have is actually a deﬁnition between equivalence classes, or orbits, of

metrics.

13

One should also note that this notion of most homogeneous initial conﬁguration is very similar to
Hawking and Hartle’s “no-boundary” proposal [17] – it is a selection of initial conditions from ﬁrst
principles. However, unlike the Hawking-Hartle Universe, here we don’t have to invoke imaginary times,
and neither are we stuck with a collapsing geometry. The topology of the Universe is S3, but little can
be said about the dynamics just by looking at reduced conﬁguration space.

Regarding the dynamics, given this conformal diﬀeomorphism symmetry content, the second result
of the paper consisted in determining the most comprehensive list of theories abiding by it. It turns out
that the set of all such theories is quite simple (see (10)).

I selected the simplest of such theories for further investigation. The shift vector was then eliminated
in a fully covariant manner, by choosing it to be a vertical correction to metric velocities, i.e. so that
˙gab − Lξgab became horizontal, i.e. orthogonal to the orbits according to the metric on conformal
superspace (60). This modiﬁed theory is given very geometrically – once one constructs (60). The added
term corresponds to a covariant gauge-ﬁxing of the shift, dependent on the metric and metric velocity.

Gauge-ﬁxings A geodesic theory in conformal superspace has reparametrization invariance, but it
is unwieldy. I have thus ﬁxed the parametrization to be given by arc-length. This choice has a great
beneﬁt: the action is expressible in terms of the energy functional, which is a much more local object
than the geodesic action.13 Furthermore extremals of the action functional automatically implement
arc-length parametrization as one of the conditions. As quipped in the main text, this gauge-ﬁxing
sacriﬁces reparametrization invariance in favor of locality of the action functional.

As regards to the local symmetry groups, in relativistic ﬁeld theories gauge ﬁxings are a choice of
section on a principal ﬁber bundle. In this language, the ﬁbers are the orbits of the ﬁelds under the action
of the symmetry groups. Fixing a section there selects one representative for each possible physical ﬁeld
conﬁguration.

Moving to the the 3+1 Lagrangian language, a gauge-ﬁxing would still amount to selecting one unique
representative for each spatial conﬁguration gab. However, using the path integral formalism, one can
ﬁnd a diﬀerent sort of gauge-ﬁxing: one which determines a unique representative for each physical path,
as opposed to each physical conﬁguration.

This gauge-ﬁxing, proposed in (28), has nothing to say about the initial point of the path integral
Instead, it ﬁxes the velocities, or the tangents to each path, to be parallel propagated.
kernel, (45).
In other words, choosing an initial point for the lifted paths. In this gauge-ﬁxing, the metric velocity
of the modiﬁed Lagrangian (42) eﬀectively corresponds to the horizontal lift of the corresponding path
in physical conﬁguration space. In this way there is no overcounting of paths, and the Fadeev-Popov
determinant cancels with the determinant coming from the horizontal lift.14
Thus, to summarize, we obtain a one-to-one relation between paths in reduced conﬁguration space,
Riem/Diﬀ(cid:110)C and the horizontal ones in Riem, but there is no need to ﬁnd a section of this bundle.
For instance, we don’t project out the conformal degrees of freedom of the metric, as what is done for
instance in shape dynamics or unimodular gravity. It is rather the case that the path along which we
gauge ﬁx automatically “parallel propagates” that scale.

Renormalizability With this gauge-ﬁxing, the Fadeev-Popov determinant cancels with the path in-
tegral of the Lagrange multipliers, X a
T, and the ﬁnal gauge-ﬁxed path integral acquires a remarkably
simple form, (45), with on-shell BRST invariance.

In the ADM formulation of gravity, since the constraints do not form a Lie algebra, it is very diﬃcult
to ﬁnd a completely BRST invariant gauge-ﬁxed path integral.15 Here I have shown explicitly how this
occurs for the theory at hand for the path integral formulation. This is my third main result.

Of course, renormalizability is not the only diﬃculty plaguing the construction of a theory of quan-
tum gravity. The asymptotic safety scenario of quantum gravity (see [18] for a review) looks at the

13I call a theory local if it can be expressible locally with the addition of gauge degrees of freedom. This is not the case

for the theory with the global square root.

14 See [15] for a similar type of gauge-ﬁxing in perturbation theory in the context of theories with a preferred foliation.
15It turns out that the ADM BRST charge is in fact of rank one [19]. In Hamiltonian variables:

Here the ghosts associated with the ADM scalar constraints, S(x), are η(x), while the ones associated with the momentum
constraints are ηa(x). The ghost momenta P and Pa follow suit. An explicit calculation shows that this deﬁnition yields
{ΩADM, ΩADM} = 0. The equations of the gauge-ﬁxed BRST Hamiltonian turn out to be rather complicated (see [20], eqs
(45)), and have not, as far as the author knows, been written in the path integral formalism.

renormalization group ﬂow of (truncated) gravitational theories in order to determine if in the UV there
are a ﬁnite number of relevant directions. But one problem which is hard to analyze in the context of
asymptotic safety is that of unitarity. Does the ﬂow in theory space preserve unitarity? For example,
Weyl gravity, i.e. the theory with the space-time action:

(cid:90)

d4√

γCabcdC abcd

where C abcd is the Weyl tensor, is a theory that turns out to be asymptotically safe, and yet it is
non-unitary, because of the higher order of time derivatives involved.16 An obstacle in the analysis of
unitarity is that these approaches use Euclidean spacetimes, and ﬁnding regulators that depend on the
background metric with indeﬁnite signature is a challenge [21].

The great advantages of the complete family of theories given in (10) are four-fold: i) they can be
explicitly kept second order in time derivatives, ii) with a distinguished preferred notion of simultaneity,
we can apply spatial regulators on the exact renormalization group equation, and iii) the theory explicitly
maintains two, transverse traceless, propagating degrees of freedom per space point, iv) it is explicitly
anomaly-free, a question the usual asymptotic safety framework is ill-equipped to address. It would be
interesting to study this model in an exact renormalization group ﬂow context [22], since its general form
is simple enough to require little truncation.

The action I used has more spatial derivatives than time derivatives, which is cause for suspecting it
can have better perturbative renormalizability properties than GR, as is the case with Horava-Lifchitz
[14]. The problem with Horava-Lifschitz, which doesn’t show up here is precisely the question of the
correct number of physical degrees of freedom, mentioned above. There, with a preferred foliation,
there is an extra scalar mode for the graviton. With the recent detection of gravitational waves, the
existence of this mode becomes highly constrained. Here we explicitly have the correct polarizations for
the gravitational momenta.

On the other hand, the problem that shows up here, and not elsewhere, is that for perturbative
renormalizability we need to choose a background more amenable to the constraints of the theory than
the usual Minkowski background. I discuss this below, when comparing the theory with GR.

These four things: i) the very simple form of (45) without need to Wick rotate, ii) BRST invariance
due to the symmetries forming a true Lie algebra, iii) the ratio of spatial/time derivatives that in Horava-
Lifschitz makes the theory power counting renormalizable, while in the present case iv) it explicitly
maintains unitarity and the correct number of degrees of freedom, raises the hope that the model can
be shown to be not only renormalizable, but also healthy, and possess the same physical dofs as the
graviton.

If this can indeed be shown, it would already be extremely interesting as a toy model, irrespective of

having the correct classical limit.17 Which brings us to the last point.

Comparison with GR and matter coupling. Even though the action of the theory is relatively
straightforward, its equations of motion can be rather complicated. Furthermore, a Minkowski back-
ground is not directly suitable for the calculations, since it is conformally ﬂat and thus has vanishing
Cotton tensor.

One idea would be to use as background a squashed sphere of high radii. Squashed spheres are simple

ds2 = (cid:96)2(cid:0)(dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2) + (dψ + cos θdφ)2(cid:1)

geometries on S3, [23]:

(59)

this has non-zero Cotton tensor, whose square gives:

(cid:18) 18(4 sin θ + 3 sin 3θ)

(cid:19)2

((cid:96)(2 cos 2θ + 1))3

CabC ab =

For large (cid:96) these geometries are very similar to conformally ﬂat space, since C abCab becomes very small.
Perturbation theory could be ﬁrst tried in this background, taking an expansion for 1/(cid:96) → 0.
16 To leading order, the propagator of the theory around a ﬂat background acquires a negative mode which is unbounded.

The analysis could be more involved over a non-ﬂat background of course.

17Most quantum gravity theories have also the problem of matching known physics. String theory doesn’t explicitly
recover the Standard Model and Loop Quantum gravity and spin foams don’t recover realistic Einstein space-times in the
appropriate limits. Asymptotic safety is on better grounds on this respect, since it is more in line with an eﬀective ﬁeld
theory approach.

15

As mentioned before, the physical degrees of freedom of the conformal geodesic theory are the same as
in general relativity: both have the transverse traceless gravitational momenta, as per equation (20). But
we need to ﬁnd a linearized version of the theory if we would like to obtain a linearized wave equation,
as in general relativity.

It is encouraging that the Yang-Mills form of the Hamiltonian for (Lie-algebra valued) one-forms
emerges very naturally, from the requirements of conformal covariance and conformal weight matching,
in (22). For scalar ﬁelds, we are required to have the diﬀerent number of spatial and time derivatives,
p2
ϕ +β((∂ϕ)2)3/2 as in (25).18 In fact, much like minimal coupling and covariance in GR, the requirements
of conformal diﬀeomorphism invariance almost uniquely determine the couplings of matter ﬁelds to the
metric degrees of freedom. Of course, to truly determine what types of matter are allowed, and how
they should be included in the Lagrangian requires a deeper eﬀective ﬁeld theory study, with running of
couplings, etc.

Nonetheless, the distinct extra coupling of all matter ﬁelds and gravitons to the geometry through
multiplication by powers of C abCab can give an extra, dynamical hierarchy to the diﬀerent interactions.
It seems that all of our couplings to the gravitational sector have to be in some sense non-minimal,
meaning that diﬀerent regimes of gravity can suppress or amplify diﬀerent types of interactions.19.

Lorentz symmetry First, we should remark that it is not because the theory does not appear to be
general relativity – since it has an anisotropic number of spatial and time derivatives – that it cannot
match it phenomenologically.20 The time appearing in the equations of motion is merely the path
parameter in conﬁguration space, and might have little to do with actual experienced duration.

Heuristically, it seems natural that if duration is given by a unit of spatial change, then variations
in this “duration time” and in space need to be matched.
I.e. we should have the same number of
experienced time derivatives and spatial derivatives. Also, if the equations of motion of matter have the
same type of anisotropy than the space-time ones, then even naively there might be no actual way of
experiencing Lorentz invariance for local matter interactions.

The important question at this level of enquiry is that of the existence of a Universal light-cone,
or at least one up to current experimental bounds. Suppose we calculate the equations of motion and
obtain some evolution equation in t for disturbances in the ﬁelds. Then if we measure time by the
frequency of these waves, and length by their wavelength, the question is whether the resulting velocities
are independent of which frequency the waves have. In simpler terms, we need to verify if a propagation
of a disturbance at one energy can overtake that of another. This question boils down to the governing
equation being of hyperbolic character. For the Yang-Mills type interaction (23) we deﬁnitely will obtain
such hyperbolic equations, which already accounts for most of our experience with universal light cones
(and which will dominate in the gravitationally adiabatic background). But that is not the case for the
scalar interactions we proposed (25), which naively would give elliptic equations. For gravity, it is at
this juncture not yet possible to tell, for we need a detailed study of its equations of motion, which are
complicated, and we need to choose a background suitable for this investigation, for example, the one
in (59). In any case, experimental bounds for a Universal gravitational light cone don’t seem to be that
strict experimentally, as far as I am aware.

For a detailed study of the phenomenological comparison with GR we should reconstruct an expe-
rienced space-time. However, since there is no lapse in this theory, we must ﬁrst extract a notion of
duration from a measure of the conformal change of geometry. That is, calculate how weakly back-
reacting matter ﬁelds would experience the change the ﬁelds. This is not so far fetched as it might at
ﬁrst seem – a simple technique was developed and used in shape dynamics by Koslowski in [26] yielding
the correct results to phenomenologically match GR.

In sum, the absence of explicit Lorentz symmetry needs to be carefully scrutinized phenomenologically.

18Alternatives are to include a dilaton ﬁeld to compensate for the derivatives of the conformal factor, or have the gradient

term of the scalar ﬁeld break conformal invariance, thereby setting a preferred scale.

19 In eﬀect, such non-minimal coupling terms seem to also emerge in the usual renormalization group ﬂow of the Einstein-

Hilbert action when coupled to the standard model sector [13].

20As Petr Hoˇrava is fond of saying, preferred foliation theories do not “break Lorentz symmetry”, any more than general
relativity breaks “Unicorn symmetry”. In both cases, it is a symmetry that the theory never had, so there is nothing to
break, and naive analysis of eﬀects of “Lorentz breaking”, such as those of [24, 25] – which show that even if these eﬀects
appear at the Planck scale, they percolate to the IR through the RG ﬂow – are not applicable.

APPENDIX

A Gauge theory in Riem

It is useful to make a small diversion towards a more geometric explanation of what is known in the
relational literature as ‘best-matching’ (see e.g. [27]). The procedure is fully explained in [5].

Figure 1: The principal ﬁber bundle picture with group G, showing a horizontally lifted curve from the
base space.

For this geometric approach, one can think of conﬁguration space as an inﬁnite-dimensional principal
ﬁber bundle P = M, foliated by the group orbits of the diﬀeomorphisms G = Diﬀ, acting by pull-backs
(and scalar transformations, acting by pointwise multiplication).21
In this case, best-matching, or the gauge connection in Riem, is given by a linear action ξ : T P → g,
where g := TIdG is the corresponding (inﬁnite-dimensional) Lie algebra (for instance C∞(T M ) with the
Lie bracket for diﬀeomorphisms) and P = M.

As in usual formulations of gauge symmetry in principal ﬁber bundle language, this gives a projection
˙gab → ˙gH
ˆH :
ab into a ‘horizontal’ component of the metric velocity (see [29] for a quick introduction
to principal ﬁber bundles). That is, in the Lagrangian formulation, a “preferred shift” deﬁning an
equilocality relation – called the ‘best-matched coordinates – emerges from a connection form (see [5] for
details on how these mechanisms are constructed).

In plain words, the role of the connection form (i.e. of best-matching) is to project out the pure
‘coordinate-change’ component of a metric velocity. The inverse of the (conformal) thin-sandwich dif-
ferential operator (see [30]) is obtainable by such a form which projects out orthogonal components to
the ﬁbers, deﬁning ˆH. If a given supermetric is positive-deﬁnite and covariant with respect to the gauge
transformations, we can deﬁne ˆH by the projection orthogonal to the ﬁbers. This is what is done for
2 (gacgbd +gbcgad) (i.e. the
instance in [6] (see also [7]), using the canonical supermetric in Riem, Gabcd
canonical supermetric with zero DeWitt parameter), one obtains a transverse projection, i.e. ∇a ˙gH
ab = 0.
21While not strictly true, due to the stratiﬁed nature of the quotient M/Diﬀ (see [16]), one can make sense of this as a
principal ﬁber bundle if one considers only the diﬀeomorphisms which ﬁx one point of M , and a linear frame on it. [28].

be covariant with respect to conformal diﬀeomorphisms in section 2 .22 The integrand in (60) is thus
invariant under conformal transformations. Thus, using (60), one forms a genuine gauge connection from

ﬁbers.

For the more formal mathematical proof that one can indeed obtain a connection form from this
orthogonality criterion, one needs to show that the criterion can be expressed as the kernel of an elliptic
operator, and use the Fredholm alternative in the inﬁnite-dimensional Banach space case. This is done
to full detail in [5]. Here I will just sketch the method.

The trick is to rewrite the full group of diﬀeomorphisms as a product of the incompressible dif-
feomorphisms and the pure dilatations. These are generated by divergenceless vecotr ﬁelds and their
complements. In that case, we have, we have from an orthogonality condition to the ﬁber, according to
(60):

Given a metric velocity, ˙gab ∈ TgP , we want to horizontally correct it, as is the job of the usual covariant

Since we want to invert this for ξa and ρ, we look at equations (62) and (63) as equations to be inverted
for ξa and ρ in terms of sources given by the metric and its time derivatives.
The condition for the existence of an element of TgM which is both orthogonal to a ﬁber and parallel

to it (i.e. is both horizontal and vertical) is that a non-zero ξa exist such that

solutions in case the metric has conformal Killing vector ﬁelds (since we are taking the transverse part

22Let, f1, f2 be diﬀeomorphisms, and ρ1, ρ2 two scalar transformations, conformal diﬀemorphisms have group structure
(f1, ρ1)·(f2, ρ2) = (f1◦f2, ρ2(ρ1(f2))) where ρ2(ρ1(f2)) just means scalar multiplication at each x ∈ M as θ2(x)(ρ1(f2(x))).
As with Diﬀ, C is an inﬁnite-dimensional regular Lie group and it acts on M on the right as a group of transformations by:

(Dif f (cid:110) C) × M → M

B ‘t Hooft gauge-ﬁxing of the action

An alternative route to prove BRST invariance of the gauge-ﬁxed path integral is to use the Nakanishi-
Laudrup trick, and the quadratic form of the gauge-ﬁxing term that comes with it.
By adding a term of the form δBO to the classical action, we are guaranteed to maintain BRST
B = 0. For this, we institute the same transformations as given in (46), but now we

C The energy-momentum tensor and conformal ﬂatness

We note that, for regions that approximate a conformally ﬂat space – let’s call this the gravitational
soft limit – the leading order terms in the Hamiltonian become the gravitational and scalar interactions,
with the Yang-Mills part becoming sub-leading, unless we are in the gravitational adiabatic limit, when
˙gab also approximates zero at a rate faster than the square root of the Cotton tensor.

19

But more worrisome is the fact that when we calculate the equations of motion for a nearly conformally
ﬂat background, metric variations of the Yang-Mills terms in the Lagrangian – which should be the energy
momentum tensor to source the gravitational equations of motion – will diverge with a diﬀerent power
than the gravitational+scalar part (again, unless we are in the gravitational adiabatic limit). After some
calculation, that would likely obligate us to set the coeﬃcients of the vector Lagrangian (23) to zero.

This conclusion seems dangerous phenomenologically, for it would require vanishing Yang-Mills ﬁelds
in regions that are nearly conformally ﬂat and not gravitationally adiabatic. In that case we would have
only two alternatives, as far as I can see: either to let the Yang-Mills ﬁelds break conformal invariance or
to have the coupling constants transform under conformal transformations of the metric, which would still
demand that the electromagnetic term transform covariantly with respect to conformal transformations
(i.e. so that it does not contain derivatives of the conformal factor). Both alternatives are written as:

If αv, βv don’t conformally transform, both terms now break conformal invariance, with diﬀerent
powers in fact: for gab → e4φgab, the E2 term scales as e−4φ and the B2 term as e−8φ. This looks a
lot like Hoˇrava’s anisotropic scaling [14]. The term (∇ϕ)2 would also transform as the E2 term. If the
couplings do transform conformally, this brings issues of its own, and we would presumably need to use
the methods of the local renormalization group ﬂow to study the running of these couplings [32].
We note that some semblance of Lorentz symmetry has in any case been restored, with βv playing the
role of c2. We also note that upon a conformal transformation gab → e4φgab, we can solve the equations
of motion for the conformal factor, setting: e4φ =
