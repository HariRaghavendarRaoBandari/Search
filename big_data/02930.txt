Twisted Laguerre-Gaussian lasers, with orbital angular momentum and char-

acterised by doughnut shaped intensity proﬁles, provide a transformative set of

tools and research directions in a growing range of ﬁelds and applications, from

super-resolution microcopy and ultra-fast optical communications to quantum

computing and astrophysics. The impact of twisted light is widening as recent

numerical calculations provided solutions to long-standing challenges in plasma-

based acceleration by allowing for high gradient positron acceleration. The pro-

duction of ultrahigh intensity twisted laser pulses could then also have a broad

inﬂuence on relativistic laser-matter interactions. Here we show theoretically

and with ab-initio three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, that stimulated

Raman backscattering can generate and amplify twisted lasers to Petawatt in-

tensities in plasmas. This work may open new research directions in non-linear

optics and high energy density science, compact plasma based accelerators and

light sources.

INTRODUCTION

The seminal work by L. Allen et al [1] on lasers with orbital angular momentum (OAM)

has initiated a path of signiﬁcant scientiﬁc developments that can potentially oﬀer new tech-

nologies in a growing range of ﬁelds, including microscopy [2] and imaging [3], atomic [4]

and nano-particle manipulation [5], ultra-fast optical communications [6, 7], quantum com-

puting [8] and astrophysics [9]. At intensities beyond material breakdown thresholds, it
has been recently shown through theory and simulations that intense (with (cid:38) 1018 Wcm−2
intensities) and short (with 10 − 100 fs durations) twisted laser beams could also excite
strongly non-linear plasma waves suitable for high gradient positron acceleration in plasma

accelerators [10]. As a result of their importance, many techniques have emerged to pro-

duce Laguerre-Gaussian lasers over a wide range of frequencies [11]. Common schemes

employ spiral phase plates or computer generated holograms to generate visible light with

OAM, non-linear optical media for high-harmonic generation and emission of XUV OAM

lasers [12, 13] or spiral electron beams in free-electron lasers to produce OAM x-rays [14, 16].

Optical elements such as spiral phase plates are designed for the production of laser

beams with pre-deﬁned OAM mode contents. Novel and more ﬂexible mechanisms capable of

2

producing and amplifying beams that with arbitrary, well deﬁned orbital angular momentum

states, using a single optical component, would then be interesting from a fundamental point

of view, while also beneﬁting experiments where OAM light is relevant. In addition, the

possibility of extending these mechanisms to the production and ampliﬁcation of laser pulses

with relativistic intensities, well above the damage thresholds of optical devices, could also

open exciting perspectives for high energy density science and applications. The use of a

plasma as the optical medium is a potential route towards the production of OAM light with

relativistic intensities [15]. Although other routes may be used to produce high intensity

OAM laser pulses, for instance by placing spiral phase plates either at the start or at the

end of a laser ampliﬁcation chain [17, 18], the use of plasmas can potentially lead to the

ampliﬁcation of OAM light to very high powers and intensities. Plasmas also allow for

greater ﬂexibility in the level of orbital angular momentum in the output laser beam than

other more conventional techniques.

Here, we show that stimulated Raman scattering processes in non-linear optical media

with a Kerr non-linearity can be used to generate and to amplify OAM light. Plasmas,

optical ﬁbres and non-linear optical crystals are examples of non-linear optical media with

Kerr non-linearity. Although optical parametric oscillators have also been used to transfer

OAM from a pump to down converted beams [19], here we explore the creation of new OAM

states absent from the initial conﬁguration, according to simple selection rules. We also

demonstrate that stimulated Raman scattering processes can generate and amplify OAM

light even in scenarios where no net OAM is initially present. To this end, we use an

analytical theory, valid for arbitrary transverse laser ﬁeld envelope proﬁles complemented

by the ﬁrst three-dimensional ab initio particle-in-cell simulation of the process using the

PIC code Osiris [20], considering that the optical medium is a plasma. Starting from recent

experimental and theoretical advances [21–23] our simulations and theoretical developments

show that stimulated Raman processes could pave the way to generate OAM light in non-

linear optical media and that the non-linear optics of plasmas [24, 25] could provide a path

to generate and amplify OAM light to relativistic intensities [26–29].

RESULTS

Theoretical model

We illustrate our ﬁndings considering that the non-linear optical medium is a plasma.

Extension to other materials is straightforward. In a plasma, stimulated Raman backscat-

tering is a three-wave mode coupling mechanism in which a pump pulse (frequency ω0 and

wavenumber k0), decays into an electrostatic, or Langmuir, plasma wave (frequency ωp and
wavenumber 2k0 − ωp/c) and into a counter-propagating seed laser (frequency ω1 = ω0 − ωp
and wavenumber k1 = ωp/c − k0). The presence of OAM in the pump and/or seed results
in additional matching conditions that ensure the conservation of the angular momentum

carried by the pump when the pump itself decays into a scattered EM wave and a Lang-

muir wave [30]. These additional matching conditions, which are explored in more detail in

the Supplementary Information in Supplementary Notes 1-4 and Supplementary Figs. 1-3),

correspond to selection rules for the angular momentum carried by each laser and plasma

wave. Here, we illustrate key properties of OAM generation and ampliﬁcation, by exploring

diﬀerent seed and pump conﬁgurations.

In order to derive a model capable of predicting stimulated Raman scattering OAM se-

lection rules, we start with the general equations describing Stimulated Raman scattering
e)A0 · A1, where
given by D0A0 = ω2
D0,1 = c2 (∇2⊥ + 2ik0,1∂z) + 2iω0,1∂t, Dp = 2iωp∂t. Moreover, A0,1 is the envelope of the
pump/seed laser, with complex amplitude given by A1(t, r⊥) exp [ik0,1z − iω0,1t]+c.c., where
t is the time and z the propagation distance. We note that A0,1 are arbitrary functions

pδn∗A0 and Dpδn = e2k2

of the transverse coordinate r⊥. The complex amplitude of the plasma density pertur-
bations is δn(t, r⊥) exp [ikpz − iωpt] + c.c., where kp = ωp/c is the plasma wavenumber,

ωp =(cid:112)e2n0/0me the plasma frequency, me the mass of the electron, 0 the vacuum elec-

tric permittivity, and e the elementary charge. Although these general equations can be

used to retrieve the selection rules for the orbital angular momentum that will be explored

throughout this paper, it is possible to derive exact solutions in the long pulse limit, where
k0,1∂z (cid:28) ω0,1∂t and in the limit where the pump laser contains much more energy than the
1, and A0 (cid:29) A1 (pump has more energy

new modes are created and until their energy becomes comparable to the energy in the

pump pulse). In this case, it is possible to show that stimulated Raman scattering of a seed

beam A1 from a pump beam A0 creates a plasma wave density perturbation given by:

where (ω1, k1) are the frequency and wavenumber of the seed laser pulse, and where C

is a constant of integration. The derivation of Eqs. (1), (2) and (3), presented in detail

in the Supplementary Note 1, assumes that the pump and the seed satisfy the frequency

matching conditions stated above, being valid for arbitrary transverse laser envelope proﬁles

as long as the paraxial equation is satisﬁed. Neglecting pump depletion does not change the

selection rules for the orbital angular momentum discussed for the remainder of this work.

Unless explicitly stated, the generic expression for the pump vector potential (or electric

ﬁeld) is A0 = A0x exp(i(cid:96)0xφ)ex + A0y exp(i(cid:96)0yφ)ey, where (ex, ey) are the unit vectors in the

transverse x and y directions and φ the azimutal angle. Similarly, the generic expression for

the seed vector potential is A1 = A1x exp(i(cid:96)1xφ)ex + A1y exp(i(cid:96)1yφ)ey. Selection rules can
then be generally derived by inserting these expressions into the factor (A1(t = 0) · A0) A0 in
Eq. (3). Although we have assumed that the plasma is the optical medium, other nonlinear

optical media with Kerr non-linearity will also exhibit similar phenomena.

Particle-in-cell simulations

We will now use Eq. (3) to explore OAM generation and ampliﬁcation in three separate

classes of initial set-ups, all identiﬁed in Fig. 1. We start by studying the case of the am-

pliﬁcation of existing OAM modes. Figure 1(a) illustrates the process in a setup leading to

the ampliﬁcation of a seed in an arbitrary, single state of orbital angular momentum (cid:96)1 in a

plasma using a counter-propagating Gaussian pump laser without OAM, but the mechanism

5

is trivially generalised for a pump with arbitrary OAM (cid:96)0. We can then assume a pump

linearly polarised in the x direction with OAM (cid:96)0x, which decays into a Langmuir plasma
wave with OAM (cid:96)p = (cid:96)0x − (cid:96)1x and into a seed, also linearly polarised in the x direction
with OAM (cid:96)1x. Making these substitutions into Eq. (3) conﬁrms that the ampliﬁcation of

A1 retains the initial seed OAM. For the speciﬁc example in Fig. 1(a) where (cid:96)0x = 0, di-
rect substitution of A0 ∼ exp(i(cid:96)0xφ)ex and of A1 ∼ exp(i(cid:96)1xφ)ex in Eq. (1) shows that the
plasma wave density perturbations δn ∼ exp[i((cid:96)0x − (cid:96)1x)φ] have OAM (cid:96)p = (cid:96)0x − (cid:96)1x = −(cid:96)1x,
i.e. the plasma wave absorbs the excess OAM that may exist between the pump and the

seed (see Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1 for several examples illustrating

angular and linear momentum matching conditions demonstrating that the plasma wave

always absorbs the excess OAM between pump and seed.) The scheme is thus ideally suited

to amplify an existing OAM seed using a long Gaussian pump without OAM. The ampliﬁ-

cation of circularly polarised OAM lasers, with both spin and orbital angular momentum,

obeys similar selection rules. For ampliﬁcation to occur in this case, and like stimulated

Raman backscattering of circularly polarised Gaussian lasers, both seed and pump need to
be polarised with the same handedness either in e+ = ex + iey or in e− = ex − iey.

Figure 2a illustrates 3D simulation results showing the ampliﬁcation of an (cid:96)1 = 1, linearly

polarised seed from a linearly polarised Gaussian pump. Simulation parameters are stated

in Table 1. Figure 2a shows that the growth rate for the ampliﬁcation process is nearly

indistinguishable from stimulated Raman ampliﬁcation of Gaussian lasers.

In agreement

with Eq. (2), this result also indicates that, in general, the overall ampliﬁcation process is

OAM independent.

Stimulated Raman scattering also provides a mechanism to create new OAM modes (i.e.

modes that are absent from the initial pump/seed lasers) and amplify them to very high

intensities. Figure 1(b), illustrates the process schematically. The pump electric ﬁelds can

have diﬀerent OAM components in both transverse directions x and y. Each component is

represented in blue and in orange in Fig. 1(b). The pump electric ﬁeld component in x has

OAM (cid:96)0x. The pump electric ﬁeld component in y has OAM (cid:96)0y. The initial seed electric

ﬁeld contains an OAM (cid:96)1x component in the x direction. After interacting in the plasma,

the pump becomes depleted and a new electric ﬁeld component appears in the seed with
OAM given by (cid:96)1y = (cid:96)1x + (cid:96)0y − (cid:96)0x.

The process can be physically understood by examining the couplings between the plasma

FIG. 1. Generation and ampliﬁcation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) lasers via stimulated

Raman Backscattering. In Raman ampliﬁcation, a long pump laser transfers its energy to a short,

counter-propagating seed laser in a plasma. The process depletes the pump laser pulse energy and

enhances the intensity of the seed laser. The seed/pump lasers propagate in the direction of the

red/green arrow, respectively. Polarisation in the x/y direction is represented by blue/orange lasers

respectively. The position of the plasma, relative to the seed and pump lasers, is shown by the

green cylinders. The back/front projections show the intensity proﬁle of the closest laser. Panel

and ampliﬁcation of a new OAM modes. Panel (c) shows the generation and ampliﬁcation of a

and light waves in the example considered above. Initially, a plasma wave will be excited

due to beating pump and seed components that have their electric ﬁelds pointing in the
transverse x direction. According to Eq. (1), the plasma wave OAM is (cid:96)p = (cid:96)0x − (cid:96)1x. This
plasma wave ensures OAM conservation for the pump and seed electric ﬁeld components in

the x direction. The (same) plasma wave also couples the pump and seed modes with electric
ﬁeld components pointing in the y direction. Thus, (cid:96)p = (cid:96)1y − (cid:96)0y must also hold in order
to ensure conservation of angular momentum. This implies the generation of a new seed

component with electric ﬁeld polarised in y so that OAM is conserved at all times and in both
components. The OAM of the new seed component is thus (cid:96)1y = (cid:96)p + (cid:96)0y = (cid:96)1x − (cid:96)0x + (cid:96)0y.

Alternatively, this selection rule can also be found by examining Eq. (3). Direct sub-
stitution of a pump proﬁle with A0 ∼ exp (i(cid:96)0xφ) ex + exp (i(cid:96)0yφ) ey and of an initial
seed proﬁle with A1 ∼ exp (i(cid:96)1xφ) ex then leads to the generation of a new seed with

of a Gaussian seed by a Gaussian pump. The initial laser conﬁguration in each panel (a)-(c)

corresponds to the initial setup illustrated by each corresponding panel (a)-(c) in Fig. 1. Panel

shows the generation and ampliﬁcation of a new OAM mode with (cid:96)1y = 3 (dashed-red) and of an

existing mode with (cid:96)1x = 1 (solid-red) from an orbital angular momentum (OAM) pump polarised

in two directions with (cid:96)0y = 2 and (cid:96)0x = 0. Panel (c) shows the ampliﬁcation of a new OAM mode

for simulation parameters.

exp [i((cid:96)1x + (cid:96)0y − (cid:96)0x)φ] ey. The same selection rules would also hold if the pump consists
of combination of a right and left handed circularly polarised modes, each with diﬀerent

OAM, and the seed initially contains only a left or right handed circularly polarised mode.

In this case a new seed component would appear with right or left handed circular polarisa-

tion. The new mode is created to ensure conservation of orbital angular momentum. The

selection rules are identical as long as polarisations in ex / ey are replaced by polarisations
in e+ / e− (where e± = ex ± iey). This setup provides a robust mechanism for the produc-
tion and ampliﬁcation of a new and well deﬁned OAM mode, absent from the initial set of

lasers. The generation of a new OAM mode when a linearly polarised seed interacts with a

pump with electric ﬁeld components in the two orthogonal directions is also illustrated in

Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2.

Figure 3 shows a result of a 3D PIC simulation illustrating the production of a new

seed mode with (cid:96)1y = 3, which is initially absent from the simulation, from a pump with

(cid:96)0y = 2, (cid:96)0x = 0 and an initial seed with (cid:96)1x = 1 (simulation parameters given in Table

laser vector potential shows helical structures, which indicate that the new mode has OAM.

The normalised vector potential forms a pattern that repeats each 3 turns, which turn in

the clock-wise direction from the front to the back of the pulse, a signature for (cid:96)1y = 3.

Field projections in the (x,y) plane also show a similar pattern further conﬁrming that the
new OAM mode has |(cid:96)1y| = 3. The change in color from blue-green in (a) to (green-red) in
(b) is a clear signature for the intensity ampliﬁcation of the new seed mode. Intensity was
calculated using I [W/cm2] = 1.27 × 1018a2
0 [µm], where λ0 = 0.8µm is the central laser
wavelength. Figure 3 also shows that the ampliﬁed laser envelope acquires a bow shaped

0/λ2

proﬁle [22, 23, 31], a key signature of Raman ampliﬁcation identiﬁed in [22]. In agreement

with theory (see Eqs. (2) and (3)), Fig. 2b shows that the new (cid:96)1y = 3 mode and the existing

(cid:96)1x = 1 OAM mode amplify at nearly coincident growth rates. Still, since it grows from

initially higher intensities, the existing (cid:96)1x = 1 mode reaches higher ﬁnal intensities than the

new OAM mode with (cid:96)1y = 3. The generation of the new modes in Fig. 2b also illustrates

the transition from the regime where the depletion of the pump is negligible (small signal,

exponential growth) to the regime where the depletion of the pump is not negligible (strong

signal, linear growth). Hence, Fig. 2b shows an exponential growth of the new mode up to

z < 0.6 mm). For z > 0.6 mm, the energy in the new seed becomes comparable to the energy

contained in the pump pulse. As a result, the growth slows down signiﬁcantly, becoming

linear with the propagation distance [27].

L. Allen et al

[1] showed that particular superpositions of Hermite-Gaussian modes

(also called Transverse Electro Magnetic or TEM modes) are mathematically equivalent

to Laguerre-Gaussian modes. Since the transverse amplitude distribution of high order

(transverse) laser modes is usually described by a product of Hermite-Gaussian polynomials,

which is also usually associated with TEM modes, this result paved the way for experimen-

tal realisation of vortex light beams with orbital angular momentum from existing TEM

laser modes. It is thus interesting and important to explore if and how stimulated Raman

backscattering can be used to generate and amplify light with orbital angular momentum

from Hermite-Gaussian laser beams, i.e. from initial conﬁgurations with no net OAM. Fig-

ure 1c illustrates the process. From now on, we refer to each Hermite-Gaussian beam as a

TEMm,n laser where (m, n) represents the Hermite-Gaussian mode. The TEM mode electric

ﬁeld is given by Eq. (5) (see Methods Section). We consider ﬁrst a Gaussian pump linearly

FIG. 3. Simulation results showing the generation and ampliﬁcation of a new orbital angular

momentum (OAM) modes. The new modes with (cid:96)1y = 3 grow from a seed with (cid:96)1x = 1 and a

linearly polarised pump with a Gaussian proﬁle in the x direction and with an OAM (cid:96)0y = 2 in

the y direction. Panel (a) refers to z = 2 mm, and panel (b) to z = 6.22 mm. The initial setup

is illustrated in Fig. 1b. Projections in the (x,z) and (y,z) planes show intensity proﬁle slices at

the mid-plane of the OAM mode (blue-green-red colours). Projections in the (x,y) plane (blue-

white-red) show the normalised vector potential (a0) ﬁeld envelope of the new OAM mode at the

longitudinal slice where the laser intensity is maximum. The envelope of the 3D laser intensity is

also shown for z > 6.25 mm in blue-green-red colours, and normalised vector potential isosurfaces

polarised at 45◦, i.e. having similar electric ﬁeld amplitudes in both transverse directions x
and y. The Gaussian pump, can then also be written as A0 ∼ TEM00 (ex + ey). In addition,
we assume a seed with a TEM10 mode electric ﬁeld component in x and with a TEM01 mode

electric ﬁeld component in y. The two seed modes are π/2 out of phase with respect to
each other. The seed is given by A1 ∼ TEM10ex + iTEM01ey. This setup is represented in
Fig. 1(c), where blue and orange colours in refer to the pump and seed components polarised

in the x and in the y directions respectively.

Although this setup has no initial OAM, since both pump and seed have no OAM,

it results in the generation and ampliﬁcation of an OAM mode with (cid:96)1 = 1.

Eq. (1), the beating between the TEM10 seed with the Gaussian pump in the x direction

will drive a TEM10 daughter plasma wave component. The beating between the iTEM01

seed and Gaussian pump in the y direction will drive a iTEM01 daughter plasma wave

component. These two plasma wave components are π/2 out of phase with respect to each

other. Hence, the resulting plasma wave will be a combination of TEM modes given by
δn ∼ TEM10− iTEM01, where the i denotes the phase diﬀerence between modes. According
to Ref. [1], this mode combination is equivalent to a Laguerre-Gaussian mode with (cid:96)p = −1.
In order to conserve angular momentum, a new seed component with (cid:96)1 = 1 will then have

to be generated and ampliﬁed in the direction of polarisation of the pump. This process is

also illustrated in Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Fig. 3.

It is also possible to reach this conclusion by substituting in Eq. (3) the expressions for
initial Gaussian pump transverse proﬁle [A0 ∼ TEM00 (ex + ey)] and initial TEM seed proﬁle
(A1 ∼ TEM10ex + iTEM01ey). This substitution yields a new seed transverse proﬁle given
by A1 ∼ (TEM10 + iTEM01) (ex + ey), corresponding to a Laguerre-Gaussian mode with
(cid:96)1 = 1 [1]. Similarly, a circularly polarised Gaussian pump and a A1 ∼ TEM10ex + TEM01ey
seed (i.e. without phase diﬀerence between the TEM10 and TEM01 modes) would also lead
to a new seed component with |(cid:96)1| = 1. The plasma can then be viewed as a high intensity
mode converter.

Figure 4 shows results from a 3D simulation that conﬁrms these predictions (see Table 1

for simulation parameters). The simulation setup follows the example of Fig. 1c described

earlier. Simulations show that stimulated Raman scattering leads to a new OAM mode with
(cid:96)1 = 1 linearly polarised at 45◦. Figure 2c shows that the ampliﬁcation rates are comparable
to the other typical scenarios shown in Fig. 2a-b. The change on the ﬁeld topology of the

seed normalised vector potential shown in Fig. 4, from plane isosurfaces to helical isosurfaces,

indicates the generation of a laser with orbital angular momentum from a conﬁguration with

no net OAM. Normalised vector potential iso-surfaces, and projection in the yz direction,

form a pattern that repeats each turn and that rotates clock-wise from the front to the back

of the pulse, indicating an OAM with (cid:96)1y = 1.

polarised in x and in y with (cid:96)1x = (cid:96)1y = −1 from an initial seed polarised in the x direction with
a TEM01 mode and in the y direction with a TEM10 mode that is π/2 out of phase with respect
to the TEM01 mode polarised in x. The pump is a Gaussian laser linearly polarised at 45◦. The

plotted in all panels are identical to Fig. 3. The values of the laser vector potential illustrated by

for panels (b) and (d) are indicated in panel (b). Panels (a) and (c) show the initial seed TEM

DISCUSSION

We have so far assumed that the lasers are perfectly aligned. In experiments, however, the

beams can only be aligned within a certain precision. In the presence of misalignments, our

results will still hold as long as Raman side-scattering can be neglected, i.e. when the angle
between the two pulses is much smaller than 90◦. The k matching conditions are then still
satisﬁed in the presence of small misalignments because the non-linear medium, a plasma

in the case of our simulations, absorbs any additional transverse wavevector component.

Thus, momentum is still locally conserved thereby allowing for Raman backscatter processes

(interestingly, we note that when using OAM beams, the wavevectors of seed and pump are

already locally misaligned). Despite lowering the total interaction time, and possibly the

ﬁnal ampliﬁcation level, a small angle between the seed and pump will not change the OAM

We note that our seed laser pulse ﬁnal intensity, on the order of 1017 W/cm2, and seed

laser spot-size, on the order of 1 mm, indicate the production and ampliﬁcation of Petawatt

class twisted lasers with OAM. Additional simulations (not shown) revealed the generation

and ampliﬁcation of circularly polarised OAM modes using a scheme similar to that in

Fig. 1b. Moreover, simulations also showed that Raman ampliﬁcation can also operate

when in the absence of exact frequency/wavenumber matching between seed and pump as

long as the seed is short so that its Fourier components can still satisfy k and ω matching

conditions.

Finally, we note that our results could be extended to other non-linear optical media

with Kerr non-linearities. In a plasma, the coupling between seed and pump is through an

electron Langmuir wave, which also ensures frequency, wavenumber, and OAM matching

conditions will hold. In other nonlinear optical media, molecular vibrations, for instance,

would play the role of the plasma Langmuir wave. We note that the possibility of OAM

transfer has been explored in solids [19]. Similar phenomenology as illustrated in this work

could also be obtained in three wave mixing processes, where an idler wave could play the

role of the plasma Langmuir wave. One advantage of testing these setups in non-linear Kerr

optical media such as a crystal is that lasers with much lower intensities could be used (see

Supplementary note 5 for a discussion in nonlinear optical media with Kerr nonlinearity

admitting three-wave interaction processes). The plasma, however, oﬀers the possibility to

amplify these lasers to very high intensities. This scheme could also be used in combination

with optical pulse chirped pulse ampliﬁcation (OPCPA) to pre-generate and pre-amplify new

OAM modes via stimulated Raman scattering before they enter the plasma to be further

ampliﬁed. Similar conﬁgurations (e.g. stimulated Brillouin backscattering [32]) can also be

envisaged to produce intense OAM light.

METHODS

Setup of numerical simulations and simulation parameters

Simulations have been performed using the massively parallel, fully relativistic, electro-

magnetic particle-in-cell (PIC) code Osiris [20]. In the PIC algorithm, spatial dimensions

13

are discretised by a numerical grid. Electric and magnetic ﬁelds are deﬁned in each grid cell

and advanced through a ﬁnite diﬀerence solver for the full set of Maxwell’s equations. Each

cell contains macro-particles representing an ensemble of real charged particles. Macro-

particles are advanced according to the Lorentz force. Since background plasma ion motion

is negligible for our conditions, ions have been treated as a positivelly charged immobile

background. The plasma was initialised at the front of the simulation box that moves at

the speed of light c. Note that although the simulation are performed in a frame that moves

at c, the moving window corresponds to a Galilean transformation of coordinates where all

computations are still performed in the laboratory frame. The simulation box dimensions
were 50 µm × 2870 µm × 2870 µm, it has been divided into 650 × 2400 × 2400 cells, and
each cell contains 1 × 1 × 1 particles (3.7 × 109 simulation particles in total). Additional
simulations with 1 × 2 × 2 particles per cell showed no inﬂuence on our conclusions and
simulation results. The pump laser was injected backwards from the leading edge of the

moving window [33, 34]. In order to conserve canonical momentum, the momentum of each

plasma electron macro-particle has been set to match the normalised laser vector potential.

The particles are initialised with no thermal spread.

TABLE I. Laser parameters for the diﬀerent Raman Ampliﬁcation regimes to generate

and amplify OAM lasers.Simulation parameters are close to ideal Raman ampliﬁcation regimes

determined by [22].
In all simulations, the probe is has a central wavelength of 1 µm. The
background plasma density is n0 = 4.3 × 1018cm − 3 for all simulations presented. When the
pump/probe initially has components in the both transverse directions, the initial peak a0, spot-

size and durations present in the table are identical for every component. L(cid:96)

n refers to a Laguerre-

Gaussian (n, (cid:96)) mode, where the OAM corresponds to the index (cid:96). TEMmn correspond to Hermite-

Gaussian lasers with order (m, n). The table only describes the initial simulation conditions.
