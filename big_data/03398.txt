ASYMPTOTICALLY GOOD 4-QUASI TRANSITIVE

ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY CODES OVER PRIME FIELDS

MARÍA CHARA, RICARDO TOLEDANO,

RICARDO PODESTÁ

Abstract. We study the asymptotic behavior of a family of algebraic geometry codes which
are 4-quasi transitive linear codes. We prove that this family is asymptotically good over
many prime ﬁelds using towers of algebraic function ﬁelds.

1. Introduction

It was proved in [12] and [2] that several classes of algebraic geometry codes, such as
transitive codes, self-dual codes and quasi transitive codes among others, are asymptoti-
cally good over ﬁnite ﬁelds with square and cubic cardinality. Similar results were proved
in [3] for general non-prime ﬁelds. In fact, some of them attain the well known Tsfasman-
Vladut-Zink bound and also improvements for another well known bound of Gilbert-
Varshamov were given. These results were achieved by considering algebraic geometry
codes associated to asymptotically good towers of function ﬁelds over suitable ﬁnite ﬁelds.
Remarkably few things are known with respect to the behavior of families of AG-codes
over prime ﬁelds with some additional structure, besides linearity. One reason for this
situation is that the main tool used to produce good sequences of AG-codes is the Galois
closure of some asymptotically good recursive tower of function ﬁelds and, so far, no
recursive tower has been found to be asymptotically good over a prime ﬁeld. The main
goal of this work is to prove the existence of asymptotically good 4-quasi transitive codes
over many prime ﬁelds.

An outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we review the basic deﬁnitions and
concepts on algebraic codes, algebraic-geometry codes (AG-codes for short) and the no-
tion of their asymptotic behavior, which will be used throughout the paper. In Section 3,
we review the standard way to get asymptotically good sequences of AG-codes attaining
what we call a (λ, δ)-bound (see Deﬁnition 2.1).

In Section 4 we prove the main result, Theorem 4.1, asserting that the existence of a
separable polynomial over Fq with certain properties implies that there are asymptotically
good 4-quasi transitive codes over Fq in odd characteristic. In Corollary 4.2 we show how
to obtain a concrete polynomial where these properties are computationally simple to
check.
In this way we can prove that there are asymptotically good 4-quasi transitive
codes over Fp for inﬁnitely many primes p having a concrete form such as, for instance,
primes of the form p = 220n + 1 or p = 232n + 1. In fact, using Corollary 4.2, it is easy
to check that there exist asymptotically good sequences of 4-quasi transitive linear codes
over Fp for each prime 13 ≤ p ≤ M for large values of M, say M = 106. All of this suggests
that the same conclusion must hold for any prime p ≥ 13.

Finally, in Section 5, we consider a distinguished subclass of transitive codes, namely,
the class of cyclic codes. The asymptotic behavior of this class is a a long standing open
problem in coding theory. We prove that the methods used for the cases of transitive or
quasi-transitive AG-codes, i.e. those ones using asymptotically good towers of function
ﬁelds and automorphisms, are rather unsuited to deal with these problems.

2. Preliminaries

A linear code of length n, dimension k and minimum distance d over a ﬁnite ﬁeld
q with k = dimC and d =
Fq with q elements, is simply an Fq-linear subspace C of Fn
min{d(c, c′) : c, c′ ∈ C, c 6= c′}, where d is the Hamming distance in Fn
q . The elements of C
are usually called codewords and it is customary to say that C is an [n, k, d]-code over Fq.
q we have the dual code C⊥ of C which is just the
By using the standard inner product in Fn
dual of C in Fn
Transitive and quasi transitive codes. There is a natural action of the permutation group Sn
on Fn

q as a Fq-vector space. A code C is called self-dual if C⊥ = C.

q given by

π · (v1, . . . , vn) = (vπ(1), . . . , vπ(n))

where π ∈ Sn and (v1, . . . , vn) ∈ Fn
q . The set of all π ∈ Sn such that π · c ∈ C for all
codewords c of C forms a subgroup Perm(C) of Sn which is called the permutation group of
C (sometimes denoted by PAut(C)), that is

Perm(C) = {π ∈ Sn : π(C) = C}.

A code C is called transitive if Perm(C) acts transitively on C, i.e. for any c ∈ C and 1 ≤
i < j ≤ n there exists π ∈ Perm(C) such that π(i) = j. An important particular case
of the class of transitive codes is the class of cyclic codes. These are the ones which are
invariant under the action of the cyclic shift s ∈ Sn deﬁned as s(1) = n and s(i) = i − 1
for i = 2, . . . , n, i.e. a code C is cyclic if s · c ∈ C for every c ∈ C.
Suppose now that n = rm for some positive integers r and m. We have an action of
Sm on Fn
q divided into r consecutive blocks of m
coordinates

q as follows: we consider any v ∈ Fn

v = (v1,1, . . . , v1,m, v2,1, . . . , v2,m, . . . , vr,1, . . . , vr,m),

and if π ∈ Sm we deﬁne the action block by block, i.e.

π · v = (v1,π(1), . . . , v1,π(m), v2,π(1), . . . , v2,π(m), . . . , vr,π(1), . . . , vr,π(m)).

The set of all π ∈ Sm such that π · c ∈ C for all words c of C forms a subgroup Permr(C)
of Sm which is called the r-permutation group of C. A code C is called r-quasi transitive if
Permr(C) acts transitively on each of the r blocks of every word of C, i.e. for any c ∈ C and
1 ≤ i < j ≤ m there exists π ∈ Permr(C) such that π(i) = j. Note that 1-quasi transitive
codes are just the transitive codes.

Asymptotic behavior. It is convenient to normalize the dimension and minimum distance
of a code C with respect to the length n so that the information rate R = R(C) : = k/n and
the relative minimum distance δ = δ(C) : = d/n of C are in the unit interval for any [n, k, d]-
code C. The goodness of a [n, k, d]-code over Fq is usually measured according to how big
the sum R + δ = k/n + d/n is. Since k and d can not be arbitrarily large for n ﬁxed, it is
natural to allow arbitrarily large lengths, i.e. it is natural to consider a sequence {Ci}∞
i=0 of
[ni, ki, di]-codes over Fq such that ni → ∞ as i → ∞ and see how big the sum ki/ni + di/ni
can be as ni → ∞.

A sequence {Ci}∞

i=0 of [ni, ki, di]-codes over Fq is called asymptotically good over Fq if

lim sup

i→∞

ki
ni

> 0

and

lim sup

i→∞

di
ni

> 0

where ni → ∞ as i → ∞.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let λ ∈ (0, 1) and let r = λ − δ > 0 where λ > δ > 0. A sequence {Ci}∞
of [ni, ki, di]-codes over Fq is said to attain an (λ, δ)- bound over Fq if

i=0

lim sup

i→∞

ki
ni ≥ r

and

lim sup

i→∞

di
ni ≥ δ .

Thus a lower bound for the above mentioned goodness of a code is obtained for a suf-

ﬁciently large index i since

ki
ni

di
ni ∼ r + δ = λ,

as i → ∞. In other words, we say more than the good asymptotic behavior of the sequence
of codes {Ci}∞
i=0.
Consider now the so called Ihara’s function (see, for instance, [9] and [13])

A(q) : = lim sup

g→∞

Nq(g)

g

,

where Nq(g) is the maximum number of rational places that a function ﬁeld over Fq of
genus g can have.
It was proved by Serre ([10]) that A(q) ≥ c log q for some positive
constant c and by Drinfeld and Vladut ([15]) that A(q) ≤ √q − 1. There are several im-
provements and reﬁnements of lower bounds for A(q) as can be seen in [9].
Let {Ci}∞
i=0 be a sequence of codes over Fq such that A(q) > 1. The sequence is said
to attain the Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink bound over Fq if it attains an (λ, δ)-bound with λ = 1 −
A(q)−1. This special (λ, δ)-bound gives a lower bound for the so called Manin’s function
αq(δ). More precisely

αq(δ) : = lim sup
n→∞

1

n logq Aq(n,⌊δn⌋) ≥ 1 −

1
A(q) − δ,

where 0 ≤ δ ≤ 1 and Aq(n, d) denotes the maximum number of words that a code over Fq
of length n and minimum distance d can have. For squares q ≥ 49, the Tsfasman-Vladut-
Zink bound over Fq improves the Gilbert-Varshamov bound which was considered, for
some time, the best lower bound for Manin’s function (see [13], [12] and [14]).

AG-codes. Many families of linear codes over Fq have been proved to attain the above
mentioned Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink bound using Goppa ideas for constructing linear codes
from the set of rational points of algebraic curves over Fq. These linear codes are called
algebraic geometry codes (or simply AG-codes) and some standard references for AG-codes
are the books [13], [14], [7], [8] and [11]. We recall now their construction using the termi-
nology of function ﬁelds (instead of algebraic curves) following [13]. Let F be an algebraic
function ﬁeld over Fq, let D = P1 +··· + Pn and G be divisors of F with disjoint supports,
where P1, . . . , Pn are diﬀerent rational places of F . Consider now the Riemann-Roch space
associated to G

(2.1)

L(G) = {u ∈ F r {0} : (u) ≥ −G} ∪ {0},

4

M. CHARA, R. TOLEDANO, R. PODESTÁ

where (u) denotes the principal divisor associated to u ∈ F . The AG-code deﬁned by F ,
D and G is
(2.2)
where u(Pi) stands for the residue class of x modulo Pi.

C = CL(D, G) =(cid:8)(cid:0)u(P1), u(P2), . . . , u(Pn)(cid:1) ∈ Fn

q : u ∈ L(G)(cid:9),

An important feature of these codes is that lower bounds for their dimension k and
minimum distance d are available in terms of the genus g(F ) of F and the degree deg G
of G. More precisely,
(i) k ≥ deg G + 1 − g(F ) if deg G < n, and
(ii) d ≥ n − deg G.
Furthermore, if 2g(F ) − 2 < deg G < n then k = deg G + 1 − g(F ).
In view of the usefulness of AG-codes in asymptotic problems, the following question is
of interest in the theory of AG-codes: given a function ﬁeld F over Fq, how can we construct an
AG-code with some prescribed property, besides linearity? Something can be achieved in this
direction by considering a ﬁnite and separable extension F of a rational function ﬁeld
Fq(x) and using the action of the group Aut(F/Fq(x)) of Fq(x)-automorphisms of F on
the places of F . It is well known (see, for instance, [13]) that Aut(F/Fq(x)) acts on the set
of all places of F and this action is extended naturally to divisors. Even more, if F/Fq(x)
is Galois extension and {P1, . . . , Pn} is the set of of all places of F lying above a place P
of Fq(x), then for each 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n there exists σ ∈ Gal(F/Fq(x)) such that σ(Pi) = Pj.
This means that Gal(F/Fq(x)) acts transitively on the set {P1, . . . , Pn}.
Suppose now that σ(G) = G for any σ ∈ H where H is a subgroup of Aut(F/Fq(x)).
Then there is an action of H on CL(D, G) deﬁned as

σ ·(cid:0)u(P1), u(P2), . . . , u(Pn)(cid:1) : =(cid:0)u(σ(P1)), u(σ(P2)), . . . , u(σ(Pn))(cid:1).

It is clear that all of this implies that the AG-code CL(D, G) is transitive if H acts transi-
tively on the set {P1, . . . , Pn}. Similarly, if H is a cyclic group then, under the above con-
ditions, the AG-code CL(D, G) is cyclic (see Section 5 for a more detailed discussion). For
self-duality, just a prime element t for all the places P1, . . . , Pn is needed. Then if 2G − D
is the principal divisor (dt/t), it can be proved that the AG-code CL(D, G) is self-dual (see
Chapter 8 of [13]).

3. Good AG-codes from sequences of function fields

Let K be a perfect ﬁeld. A function ﬁeld (of one variable) F over K is a ﬁnite algebraic
extension F of the rational function ﬁeld K(x), where x is a transcendental element over
K. Following [13], a tower F (of function ﬁelds) over a perfect ﬁeld K is a sequence F =
{Fi}∞

i=0 of function ﬁelds over K such that
(1) Fi ( Fi+1 for all i ≥ 0.
(2) The extension Fi+1/Fi is ﬁnite and separable, for all i ≥ 1.
(3) The ﬁeld K is algebraically closed in Fi, for all i ≥ 0.
(4) The genus g(Fi) of Fi tends to inﬁnity, for i → ∞.

A tower F = {Fi}∞
elements {xi}∞
K(x0) and

i=0 over K is called recursive if there exist a sequence of transcendental
i=0 over K and a bivariate polynomial H(X, Y ) ∈ K[X, Y ] such that F0 =

Fi+1 = Fi(xi+1), where H(xi, xi+1) = 0,

for all i ≥ 0.

AG-CODES: ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR

Now we deﬁne the concept of the asymptotic behavior of a tower over K. Let F =
{Fi}∞

i=0 be a tower of function ﬁelds over K. The genus γ(F) of F over F0 is deﬁned as

γ(F) := lim

i→∞

g(Fi)

[Fi : F0]

.

When K is a ﬁnite ﬁeld, we denote by N (Fi) the number of rational places (i.e., places of
degree one) of Fi and the splitting rate ν(F) of F over F0 is deﬁned as

ν(F) := lim

i→∞

N (Fi)
[Fi : F0]

.

A tower F is called asymptotically good over a ﬁnite ﬁeld K if
γ(F) < ∞.

ν(F) > 0

and

Otherwise is called asymptotically bad. Equivalently, a tower F is asymptotically good over
a ﬁnite ﬁeld K if and only if the limit of the tower F

λ(F) := lim

i→∞

N (Fi)
g(Fi)

,

is positive, where g(Fi) stands for the genus of Fi.

There is an standard way to construct a sequence of AG-codes over a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq
attaining a (λ, δ)-bound as we show in the following lemma. We include the proof for the
convenience of the reader.
Proposition 3.1. Let F = {Fi}∞
their full ﬁeld of constants and such that for each i ≥ 1 there are ni rational places P (i)
in Fi with ni ∈ N. Let ℓ ∈ (0, 1) and suppose that the following conditions hold:

i=0 be a sequence of algebraic function ﬁelds over Fq with Fq as
1 , . . . , P (i)

(a) ni → ∞ as i → ∞,
(b) there exists an index i0 such that g(Fi)
(c) for each i > 0 there exists a divisor Gi of Fi whose support is disjoint from the support of

ni ≤ ℓ for all i ≥ i0, and

ni

Di := P (i)

1 + ··· + P (i)

ni such that

deg Gi ≤ ni s(i),

where s : N → R with s(i) → 0 as i → ∞.

i=m such that F induces a sequence G =
i=m of asymptotically good AG-codes of the form Ci = CL(Di, riGi) attaining a (λ, δ)-bound

Then there exists a sequence of positive integers {ri}∞
{Ci}∞
with λ = 1 − l and 0 < δ < λ.
Proof. Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be a ﬁxed real number such that 1 − δ > ℓ. Note that δ depends only
on ℓ. For any given ǫ > 0 such that ǫ < 1 − δ there exists an index iǫ > 0 such that

deg Gi

ni

< ǫ

for all i ≥ iǫ. Clearly, we can ﬁnd a positive integer ri such that
(3.1)

deg Gi

1 − δ ≥ ri

ni

> 1 − δ − ǫ .

Let us consider now the AG-code Ci = CL(Di, riGi) for i ≥ i0. This is a code of length
ni and we have that its minimum distance di satisﬁes
di ≥ ni − ri deg Gi .

6

M. CHARA, R. TOLEDANO, R. PODESTÁ

From this and the left hand side inequality in (3.1) we see that the relative minimum
distance Ci satisﬁes

ni ≥ δ.
On the other hand, for the dimension ki of Ci we have

di
ni ≥ 1 − ri

deg Gi

ki ≥ ri deg Gi + 1 − g(Fi) > ri deg Gi − g(Fi) .

So that by (b) and the right hand side inequality in (3.1) the information rate of Ci satisﬁes

ki
ni

ri deg Gi

− ℓ ≥ 1 − δ − ǫ − ℓ

for i ≥ m = max{i0, iǫ}. Since ǫ can be arbitrarily small, we have

ni ≥ δ,

ki
ni ≥ 1 − δ − ℓ

lim sup

lim sup

and

i→∞

i→∞

(cid:3)

so that the sequence of AG-codes {Ci} attains a (λ, δ)-bound as claimed.
It is easy to see that in a concrete situation the crucial properties to have are conditions
(b) and (c). In fact, once (a) and (b) are satisﬁed, condition (c) is not a problem unless we
want the codes Ci to have some prescribed structure. More precisely, one can just consider
Gi = Pi, where Pi is a rational place of Fi which is not in the support of Di. However,
this choice of Gi may not be adequate in certain cases like, for instance, the case when the
invariance of Gi under some F0-embedding of Fi is needed as it happens when a required
structure of the constructed code is induced by the action of a Galois group.
Remark 3.2. Proposition 3.1 holds in the case of an asymptotically good towerF = {Fi}∞
i=0
of function ﬁelds over Fq whose limit is bigger than 1. In fact, if Ni is the number of ratio-
nal places of Fi then we can take ni = Ni − 1, Gi = Qi (where Qi is the rational place of
Fi not considered among the chosen ni rational places) and s(i) = 1/ni. Then

lim
i→∞

ni

g(Fi)

= lim
i→∞

Ni − 1
g(Fi)

> 1

so that there is an index i0 such that (b) of Proposition 3.1 holds for all i ≥ i0. Clearly, items
(a) and (c) also holds. Further, notice that if (b) holds using the sequence of function ﬁelds
of a tower F = {Fi}∞

i=0 over Fq, then

lim
i→∞

Ni
g(Fi) ≥ lim sup

i→∞

ni
g(Fi) ≥ ℓ−1 > 1

so that the limit of the considered tower is bigger than 1.
Remark 3.3. The constant ℓ in (b) satisﬁes the estimate ℓ−1 ≤ √q − 1. To see this recall
the upper bound of Drinfeld and Vladut for Ihara’s function, namely A(q) ≤ √q − 1. By
deﬁnition of A(q) we have that

(3.2)

A(q) ≥

ni
g(Fi) ≥ ℓ−1 ,

and the claim follows. This bound also tell us that the construction of asymptotically good
AG-codes over Fq provided by Lemma 3.1 can not be carried out for q ≤ 4.
We now use Lemma 3.1 to give examples of asymptotically good AG-codes over Fq2, Fq3

and also over Fq for an arbitrary q large enough.

AG-CODES: ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR

Example 3.4. For each q > 2 there is a family of AG-codes over Fq2 which is asymptotically
good. To show this we just use the function ﬁelds in the recursive tower F = {Fi}∞
i=0 over
Fq2 of Garcia and Stichtenoth whose deﬁning equation is

yq + y =

xq

xq−1 + 1

.

It is known (see, for instance, [9, Example 5.4.1]) that N (Fi) ≥ qi−1(q2 − q) + 1 and

g(Fi) =((q

(q

i

i−1

2 − 1)2
2 − 1)(q

for i even,
for i odd.

i−2

Thus, by taking ni = qi−1(q2 − q), we have ni + 1 rational places P (i)

1 , . . . , P (i)

ni , Qi in Fi and

ni
g(Fi) ≥ q − 1 ,

for all i ≥ 1. We readily see that condition (a) in Lemma 3.1 holds and the same happens
with condition (b) with ℓ = (q − 1)−1 = A(q)−1. Finally, by taking Gi = Qi, we see that
condition (c) also holds with s(i) = 1/ni. In this way, by Lemma 3.1, the sequence {Ci}i∈N
of AG-codes Ci = C(Di, Qi), with Di = P (i)
1 +···+P (i)
ni , is asymptotically good and attains
the Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink bound over Fq2 for q ≥ 3.
Serre’s type lower bound for A(q) give us a way to prove that the family of AG-codes

over Fq is asymptotically good for any q large enough.

Example 3.5. It is well known ([9, Theorem 5.2.9]) that

A(q) ≥ 1

96 log2 q ,

for any prime power q. By deﬁnition of A(q) there exists a sequence of function ﬁelds
{Fi}∞

i=1 over Fq such that

Ni
g(Fi) ≥ 1

96 log2 q > 1,

for q > 296, where Ni = N (Fi). Take ni = Ni − 1 and consider Fq with q > 296. Thus,
condition (b) in Lemma 3.1 holds with ℓ = 1
96 log2 q and, since g(Fi) → ∞ as i → ∞,
we must have that Ni → ∞ as i → ∞ so that condition (a) also holds. The divisor Gi is
simply the remaining rational place of Fi after using the Ni − 1 rational places to deﬁne
Di. Clearly, condition (c) holds with s(i) = 1/ni. Thus, by Lemma 3.1, there is a sequence
of asymptotically good AG-codes over Fq attaining an (λ, δ)-bound for any q > 296 with
λ = 1 − 1
Example 3.6. By using a generalization of Zink’s lower bound for A(q3) proved in [4],
namely for any q ≥ 2 we have

96 log2 q and 0 < δ < λ.

A(q3) ≥

2(q2 − 1)
q + 2

> 1 .

A similar argument as in Example 3.5 shows that for any q there is an asymptotically good
AG-code over Fq3 attaining an (λ, δ)-bound with λ = 1 − q+2

2(q2−1) and 0 < δ < λ.

4. Asymptotically good 4-quasi transitive AG-codes over prime fields

From [12] and [2] we know that the class of transitive codes attains the Tsfasman-Vladut-
Zink bound over Fq2 and the class of r-quasi transitive codes attains an (λ, δ)-bound over
Fq3 with λ = 1 − (q + 2)/2r(q − 1) and 0 < δ < λ. We prove now a general result for the
case of 4-quasi transitive codes which will allow us to treat the case of prime ﬁelds.
First we quickly review some basic deﬁnitions used in the proof. The standard reference
for all of this is [13]. Let F be a function ﬁeld over K and let F ′ be a ﬁnite extension of F
of degree n. Let Q be a place of F ′. We will use the standard symbol Q|P to say the place
Q of F ′ lies over the place P of F , i.e. P = Q ∩ F . In this case e(Q|P ) and f (Q|P ) denote,
as usual, the ramiﬁcation index and the relative (or inertia) degree of Q|P , respectively.
Let P be a place of F . We say that P splits completely in F ′ if e(Q|P ) = f (Q|P ) = 1 for any
place Q of F ′ lying over P . We say that P is totally ramiﬁed in F ′ if there is only one place
Q of F ′ lying over P and e(Q|P ) = n (hence f (Q|P ) = 1).
Theorem 4.1. Let q be an odd prime power. Suppose there is a monic polynomial h(t) ∈ Fq[t] of
degree 9 which splits into (diﬀerent) linear factors over Fq and such that h(α) and h(β) are nonzero
squares in Fq for two diﬀerent elements α, β ∈ Fq. Then there exists a sequence of asymptotically
good 4-quasi transitive codes over Fq attaining an ( 1

8 , δ)-bound for 0 < δ < 1
8 .

Proof. Let x be a transcendental element over Fq. By [13, Proposition 6.3.1] we have that
the equation

y2 = h(x)

deﬁnes a cyclic Galois extension F = Fq(x, y) of degree 2 of Fq(x), where exactly 10 ratio-
nal places of Fq(x) are (totally) ramiﬁed in F , 9 of them coming from the linear factors of
h(x) and another one deﬁned by the pole P∞ of x in Fq(x). Then, F is of genus 4 and Fq
is its full constant ﬁeld. Let Pα be the zero of x − α in Fq(x). Then the residual class

h(x)(Pα) = h(α) = γ2 ,

for some 0 6= γ ∈ Fq by hypothesis. Thus the polynomial t2 − γ2 ∈ Fq[t] corresponds to
the reduction mod Pα of the right hand side of the equation y2 = h(x).
By Kummer’s theorem [13, Theorem 3.3.7] we have that Pα splits completely into two
rational places Q1 and Q2 of F . The same argument shows that Pβ also splits completely
into two rational places Q3 and Q4 of F . Let Q∞ be the only place of F lying above P∞
and put

Since there are 10 ramiﬁed places of Fq(x) in F , the T -tamely ramiﬁed and S-decomposed
Hilbert tower HT
S of F is inﬁnite (see [1, Corollary 11]). This means that there is a sequence
{Fi}∞

i=0 of function ﬁelds over Fq such that F0 = F ,

T = {Q∞}

and

S = {Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4}.

HT
S =

Fi

∞

[i=1

and, for any i ≥ 1, each place Q ∈ S splits completely in Fi, the place Q∞ is tamely
ramiﬁed in Fi, Fi/Fi−1 is an abelian extension with [Fi : F ] → ∞ as i → ∞ and Fi/F0 is
unramiﬁed outside T .
Since S is a set of rational places of F which split completely in each Fi then each Fi has
at least 4[Fi : F ] rational places and Fq is the full constant ﬁeld of Fi. Let gi be the genus of

AG-CODES: ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR

Fi. Since Fi/F is unramiﬁed outside T , the ramiﬁcation is tame and Q∞ is a ratioal place,
Hurwitz’s genus formula [13, Theorem 3.4.13] tell us that

and therefore

i lying over Q∞. Since the ramiﬁcation is tame, from Abhyankar’s
Lemma [13, Theorem 3.9.1] we see that e(Q′|Q∞) = e(Q|Q∞) where Q = Q′ ∩ Fi. Thus
e(Q′|Q) = 1, which implies that the extension F ′

In this way we see that, condition (a) of Lemma 3.1 holds and condition (b) also holds

that both divisors Di and Gi are invariant under Gal(F ′

Di and the action of Gal(F ′

CL(Di, riGi) is a 4-quasi transitive AG-code over Fq.

Corollary 4.2. Let q = pr be an odd prime power. Suppose there are 4 distinct elements α1, α2,
α3, α4 ∈ Fq such that α−1

Suppose also that there exists an element α ∈ F∗

there exists a sequence of 4-quasi transitive codes over Fq which is asymptotically good attaining a
8 , δ)-bound with 0 < δ < 1
( 1

Proof. The conclusion follows directly from Theorem 4.1 by noticing that h(0) = 1, which
is a nonzero square in Fq.

Example 4.3. It is easy to check that for p = 11 there is no separable polynomial of degree
9 satisfying the conditions required in Theorem 4.1. Let p = 13, 17, 19 and 23.
It is
straightforward to check that the elements α1 = 2, α2 = 3, α3 = 4 and α4 = 5 of Fp

with p = 13, 17 or 23 satisfy the conditions of Corollary 4.2 and

h(t) = (t + 1)(t − 2)(t − 7)(t − 3)(t − 9)(t − 4)(t − 10)(t − 5)(t − 8) ∈ F13[t],
h(t) = (t + 1)(t − 2)(t − 9)(t − 3)(t − 6)(t − 4)(t − 13)(t − 5)(t − 9) ∈ F17[t],
h(t) = (t + 1)(t − 2)(t − 12)(t − 3)(t − 8)(t − 4)(t − 6)(t − 5)(t − 14) ∈ F23[t].

Thus, by taking α = 11 ∈ F13 we have that h(11) = 3 = 42 in F13. Similarly, by choosing
α = 1 ∈ F17 and α = 7 ∈ F23 we get h(1) = 13 = 82 in F17 and h(7) = 3 = 72 in F23,
respectively.
Finally, the elements α1 = 2, α2 = 3, α3 = 4 and α4 = 6 of F19 also satisfy the conditions

of Corollary 4.2 and

h(t) = (t + 1)(t − 2)(t − 10)(t − 3)(t − 13)(t − 4)(t − 5)(t − 6)(t − 16) ,

so that by taking α = 12 ∈ F19 we have that h(12) = 4 = 22 in F19.
Therefore, from Corollary 4.2, we see that there are sequences of 4-quasi transitive codes
over Fp for p = 13, 17, 19 and 23 which are asymptotically good attaining a ( 1

with 0 < δ < 1

Corollary 4.5. There are asymptotically good 4-quasi transitive AG-codes over Fp for inﬁnite
primes p. For instance, this holds for primes of the form p = 220k + 1 or p = 232k + 1, k ∈ N.
Proof. We consider the polynomial h(t) = (t + 1)Q5
k=2(t − k)(t − kp−2) as in Example 4.4.
By Corollary 4.2, it suﬃces to ﬁnd inﬁnitely many primes p, such that(cid:0) h(p−j)
(cid:1) = 1, for a
p (cid:17) =(cid:16) −1

Since (cid:16) −1
p(cid:17) = 1 if p ≡ ±1 mod 5, it is clear that if p is of
the form p = 20k + 1 then (cid:16) −1
p(cid:17) = 1. In this way, for prime numbers of the form
p (cid:17)(cid:16) 5
p = (20 · 11)k + 1, k ∈ N, we have that(cid:16) h(p−2)

p (cid:17) =(cid:16) −1

p (cid:17) = 1 if p ≡ 1 mod 4 and (cid:16) 5

Now consider j = 7. Now we look for prime numbers p such that

p (cid:17) = 1.

p (cid:17) = 1 for primes of the form p = (8 · 29)k + 1, k ∈ N.

p(cid:17) = 1 if p ≡ ±1 mod 8 we have that if p is of the form p = 8k+1 then(cid:16) −1

and hence(cid:16) h(p−7)
By Dirichlet’s theorem on arithmetic progressions, there are inﬁnitely many prime num-
bers of the form p = 220k + 1 and p = 232k + 1 with k ∈ N, and thus the result follows. (cid:3)
Remark 4.6. As we have already seen, there are families of asymptotically good 4-quasi
transitive AG-codes over prime ﬁelds Fp for inﬁnitely many primes p. It is computationally
easy to check that Corollary 4.2 holds true, in fact, for all primes 19 < p < 106 with α1 = 2,
α2 = 3, α3 = 4 and α4 = 5 as in Example 4.4. These numerical experiments suggest that
Corollary 4.2 holds true for any prime p ≥ 13 using the polynomial given in Example 4.4,
except for p = 19.

5. Some remarks on the asymptotic behavior of cyclic AG-codes

Let F be a function ﬁeld over Fq. Recall that an AG-code CL(D, G) with D = P1+···+Pn
is cyclic if for any codeword

where u ∈ L(G), we have that

(u(P1), . . . u(Pn)) ∈ CL(D, G),

(u(Pn), u(P1), . . . u(Pn−1)) ∈ CL(D, G).

Clearly this happens if and only if for each (u(P1), , . . . u(Pn−1), u(Pn)) ∈ CL(D, G) there
exists z ∈ L(G) such that z(Pi) = u(Pi−1 mod n) for i = 1, . . . , n, i.e.

(5.1)

z(P1) = u(Pn) ,
z(P2) = u(P1) ,

...

z(Pn) = u(Pn−1) .

The existence of such an element z ∈ L(G) is a crucial question to answer in the theory of
cyclic AG-codes. So far, a positive answer can be given when the places in the support of
D belong to a ﬁnite cyclic extension F/E, for some function ﬁeld Fq(x) ⊂ E ⊂ F , and they
are lying over a unique place of E. To see this, let us consider the group Aut(F/Fq(x)) of

AG-CODES: ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR

13

all Fq(x)-automorphisms of F , where x ∈ F is transcendental over Fq. Suppose we can
ﬁnd an element σ ∈ Aut(F/Fq(x)) such that

σ(G) = G and σ(P1) = Pn, σ(P2) = P1, . . . , σ(Pn) = Pn−1.

Then, we clearly have that σ(D) = D and the element z = σ−1(u) of F does the job. In
fact, z ∈ L(G), because σ(Q) ∈ Sup G for any Q ∈ Sup G, and so

νQ(z) = νσ(Q)(z) ≥ −νσ(Q)(G) = −νQ(σ−1G) = −νQ(G),

which means that (z) ≥ −G and further

for i = 1, . . . , n, so that (5.1) holds.

z(Pi) =(cid:0)σ−1(u)(cid:1)(Pi) = u(σ(Pi)) = u(Pi−1 mod n),

We will show now that the situation above described can happen only in the presence

of cyclic extensions.

Proposition 5.1. Let F be a function ﬁeld over Fq and let P1, . . . , Pn be n diﬀerent places of F .
Suppose there exists σ ∈ Aut(F/Fq(x)) such that σ(P1) = Pn, σ(P2) = P1, . . . , σ(Pn) = Pn−1.
Then there exist an intermediate ﬁeld Fq(x) ⊂ E ⊂ F and a place P of E such that F/E is a cyclic
extension of degree m divisible by n, and P decomposes exactly in F into the places P1, . . . , Pn
with e(Pi|P )f (Pi|P ) = m
n for i = 1, . . . , n. Conversely, let F/E be a cyclic extension of function
ﬁelds over Fq of degree m. Let P be a place of E and let P1, . . . , Pn be all the places of F lying over
P . Then, m is divisible by n and we have that σ(P1) = Pn, σ(P2) = P1, . . . , σ(Pn) = Pn−1 for
any generator σ of Gal(F/E).

Proof. Let G be the subgroup of Aut(F/Fq(x)) generated by σ and let E = F G, the ﬁxed
ﬁeld of G. Thus, F/E is a cyclic extension of degree m with Galois group

Gal(F/E) = G = hσi,
where m is the order of σ in Aut(F ). Clearly Fq(x) ⊂ E.
Let P = P1 ∩ E. Then P is a place of E and, since σ(Pi) = Pi−1 mod n for i = 1, . . . , n
we also have that P = Pi ∩ E for i = 1, . . . , n. These are, in fact, all the places of F lying
above P , because G acts transitively on the set of places of F lying above P .
On the other hand we have the fundamental relation

n

e(Pi|P )f (Pi|P ) = [F : E] = m.

Xi=1

Since F/E is Galois, we have that e(Pi|P ) = e and f (Pi|P ) = f, for i = 1, . . . , n. Thus
nef = m and we are done with the ﬁrst part.
Suppose now that F/E is a cyclic extension of degree m. By the fundamental relation in
Galois extensions, n divides m. Let σ be a generator of G = Gal(F/K). If σi(P1) = σj(P1)
for some 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n then, for k = j − i > 0,

σk ∈ D(P1|P ) = {σ ∈ G : σ(P1) = P1} ,

the decomposition group of P1 over P . Since D(P1|P ) is of order ef, where e = e(Pi|P )
and f = f (Pi|P ) for i = 1, . . . , n, we have that σkef = 1. But k < n and so kef < nef = m
contradicting that m is the order of σ. Therefore {σi(P1)}n
i=1 are all distinct places of F so
that

{σ(P1), σ2(P1), . . . , σn(P1)} = {P1, P2, . . . , Pn} .

This implies that σ(P1) = Pn, σ(P2) = P1, . . . , σ(Pn) = Pn−1, after a possible renumber-
ing of the indices of the places of F lying above P .

Few things are known, so far, with regard to the asymptotic behavior of the class of cyclic
codes. Perhaps the most interesting result in this direction is the one due to Castagnoli
who proved in [5] that the class of cyclic codes whose block lengths have prime factors
belonging to a ﬁxed ﬁnite set of prime numbers is asymptotically bad. This result implies
that the construction of cyclic AG-codes in the standard way, i.e. by using an asymptoti-
cally good recursive tower F = {Fi}∞
i=0 and a rational place of F0 which splits completely
in the tower F, would lead to a sequence of codes asymptotically bad because the block
lengths of these codes is ni = [Fi : F0] for i ≥ 1, where n is the degree in both variables of
the bivariate polynomial deﬁning the tower F.
Even more can be said, as we show now in the next result. We shall need to introduce
ﬁrst the ramiﬁcation locus, Ram(F), of a towerF = {Fi}∞
i=0 of function ﬁelds over Fq, which
is simply the set of all places of F0 which are ramiﬁed in the tower, i.e.
Ram(F) = {P ∈ F0 : e(Q|P ) > 1, Q ∈ P(Fi), i ∈ N}.

This set plays a decisive role in the asymptotic behavior of towers (see, for example, Chap-
ter 7 of [13]).
Theorem 5.2. Let F = {Fi}∞
i=0 be an asymptotically good tower (not necessarily recursive) of
function ﬁelds over Fq where F0 = Fq(x) is a rational function ﬁeld. For each i ∈ N, let ni be a
positive integer and let P1, . . . , Pni be diﬀerent rational places of Fi. Suppose that for each i ∈ N
there is an element σi ∈ Aut(Fi/F0) such that

σ(P1) = Pni, σ(P2) = P1, . . . , σ(Pni) = Pni−1.

Then ni < [Fi : F0] and there exists a place P ∈ Ram(F) such that the places of Fi lying over P
are exactly P1, . . . , Pni.
Proof. Suppose that each ni ≥ [Fi : F0]. From Proposition 5.1 we see that there is a subﬁeld
Ki of Fi such that Fi/Ki is cyclic of degree mi with ni dividing mi. Since Ki is the ﬁxed
ﬁeld of σi, we have that F0 ⊂ Ki so that mi ≤ [Fi : F0]. Then ni = mi = [Fi : F0] and
this implies that Ki = F0 so that Fi/F0 is a cyclic extension for each i ≥ 0. This leads to
a contradiction because it was proved in [6] that abelian towers are asymptotically bad.
Therefore, ni < [Fi : F0] and the above argument together with Proposition 5.1 show
that F0 ( Ki and that there is a rational place Qi of Ki such that Pj lies above Qi for
j = 1, . . . , ni. If Ri = F0 ∩ Qi, then Ri is a rational place of F0 which is totally ramiﬁed in
Ki, because the relative degree f (Qi|Ri) = 1. Therefore Ri ∈ Ram(F) and clearly all the
places of Fi lying over Ri are exactly P1, . . . , Pni.

(cid:3)

Final remarks. The above result shows how diﬀerent the situation is when dealing with
the asymptotic behavior of transitive (or quasi transitive) AG-codes and cyclic AG-codes,
which are particular cases of transitive AG-codes. In the case of transitive or quasi tran-
sitive AG-codes, in each step of the tower, we have that the divisor D in the AG-code
CL(D, G) is deﬁned using all the rational places lying over a totally split rational place of
a rational function ﬁeld Fq(x). This situation is what makes possible to prove the good
asymptotic behavior of transitive or quasi transitive AG-codes.

On the other hand, for the case of cyclic AG-codes, Theorem 5.2 shows that not only
this is not possible, but also that the divisor D has to be deﬁned with all the rational
places lying over a place in the ramiﬁcation locus of the tower. From this, we arrive to
a bit surprising conclusion. Namely, that towers with only totally ramiﬁed places in the
tower, which are nice candidates for good asymptotic behavior, have to be discarded for
the construction of potentially good sequences of cyclic AG-codes, if we want to use all

AG-CODES: ASYMPTOTIC BEHAVIOR

15

the techniques and results that were successful in the transitive case. All of this, together
with Castagnoli’s result, provide some good reasons to think that towers of function ﬁelds
may not be adequate to address the problem of the asymptotic behavior of cyclic codes,
as long as the sequence of cyclic AG-codes is constructed using automorphisms of the
function ﬁelds in the tower.

Thus it is clear that the design of new methods to produce cyclic AG-codes is an interest-
ing and challenging problem with potential consequences in the study of the asymptotic
behavior of cyclic codes. In particular, it would be interesting to see if it is possible to
construct cyclic AG-codes without using automorphisms of the involved function ﬁelds.
This would be a matter of research that we plan to deal with in the near future.
