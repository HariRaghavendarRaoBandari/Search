Abstract. We prove the equivalence of several natural notions of conformal maps be-
tween sub-Riemannian manifolds. Our main contribution is in the setting of those man-
ifolds that support a suitable regularity theory for subelliptic p-Laplacian operators. For
such manifolds we prove a Liouville-type theorem, i.e., 1-quasiconformal maps are smooth.
In particular, we prove that contact manifolds support the suitable regularity. The main
new technical tools are a sub-Riemannian version of p-harmonic coordinates and a tech-
nique of propagation of regularity from horizontal layers.

CONFORMALITY IN SUB-RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS

1. Introduction

In this paper we establish the equivalence of several notions of conformality in the set-
ting of sub-Riemannian manifolds. In particular, we show that 1-quasiconformal homeo-
morphisms (see below for the deﬁnition) are in fact smooth conformal diﬀeomorphisms,
provided that there exist certain regularity estimates for weak solutions of a class of quasi-
linear degenerate elliptic PDE, i.e., the subelliptic p-Laplacian, see (2.15). Moreover, we
also show that such PDE regularity estimates hold in the important special case of sub-
Riemannian contact manifolds, thus fully establishing the Liouville theorem in this setting.
Up to now the connection between regularity of quasiconformal maps and the p-Laplacian,
and the equivalence of diﬀerent deﬁnitions of conformality, were only well understood in
the Euclidean, Riemannian, and Carnot-group settings. The general sub-Riemannian set-
ting presents genuinely new diﬃculties, e.g., subRiemannian manifolds are not locally bi-
Lipschitz equivalent to their tangent cones, Hausdorﬀ measures are not smooth, there is a
need to construct adequate coordinate charts that are compatible both with the nonlinear
PDE and with the sub-Riemannian structure, and, last but not least, the issue of optimal
regularity for p-harmonic functions is still an open problem in the general subRiemannian
setting.

The motivations for our work stem from outside of the ﬁeld of subRiemannian geometry:
One of the main applications for Liouville-type theorems, like the one we establish in this
paper, comes from a Mostow-type approach to rigidity questions. Indeed, our main result,
Theorem 1.19, implies smoothness of 1-quasiconformal boundary extensions of mappings
between strictly pseudoconvex smooth open subsets of Cn. Following an idea of Cowling,
it seems plausible that this regularity may lead to a new approach to proving Feﬀerman’s
smooth extension theorem for bi-holomorphisms (see [Fef74]), in the same spirit as Mostow
rigidiy. From a related point of view, our work also adds a new contribution to the study of
quasiconformal transformations between CR manifolds. This line of research was initiated
by Kor´anyi and Reimann in 1985 (see [KR85, KR90, Tan96]) to investigate problems such
as the question of which compact strongly pseudoconvex 3-dimensional CR manifolds are
embeddable (see for instance [Lem92] and references therein). For a further sample of
possible applications of our result see the remark after Theorem 1.19 .

The issue of regularity of 1-quasiconformal homeomorphisms in the Euclidean case was
ﬁrst studied in 1850 in Liouville’s work, where the initial regularity of the conformal home-
omorphism was assumed to be C 3. In 1958, the regularity assumption was lowered to C 1
by Hartman [Har58] and then, in conjunction with the proof of the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser
Regularity Theorem, further decreased to the Sobolev spaces W 1,n, in the work of Gehring
[Geh62] and Reˇsetnjak [RYGR67]. The role of the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser Theorem in
Gehring’s proof consists in providing adequate C 1,α estimates for solutions of the Euclidean
n-Laplacian, that are later bootstrapped to C ∞ estimates by means of elliptic regularity
theory. It is worthwhile to observe that the quest for the optimal regularity assumption in
this problem is still open (see [IM01]).

The regularity of 1-quasiconformal maps in the Riemannian case is considerably more dif-
ﬁcult than the Euclidan case. It was ﬁnally settled in 1976 by Ferrand [LF76, Fer77, LF79],
in occasion of her work on Lichnerowitz’s conjecture and was modeled after Reˇsetnjak’s

4

original proof. See also related work of Bojarski, Iwaniec, Kopiecki [BIK82]. More recently,
inspired by Taylor’s regularity proof for isometries via harmonic coordinates, Liimatainen
and Salo [LS14] provided a new proof for the regularity of 1-quasiconformal maps between
Riemannian manifolds. Their argument is based on the notion of n-harmonic coordinates,
on the morphism property for 1-quasiconformal maps, and on the C 1,α regularity estimates
for the n-Laplacian on manifolds. The proofs in the present paper are modeled on Taylor’s
approach, as developed in [LS14].

The introduction of conformal and quasiconformal maps in the sub-Riemannian setting
goes back to the proof of Mostow’s Rigidity Theorem [Mos73], where such maps arise as
boundary limits of quasi-isometries between certain Gromov hyperbolic spaces. Because
the class of spaces that arises as such boundaries in other geometric problems includes sub-
Riemannian manifolds that are not Carnot groups, it becomes relevant to study conformality
and quasiconformality in this more general environment.

In the sub-Riemannian setting the regularity is currently known only in the special case
of 1-quasiconformal maps in Carnot groups, see [Pan89, KR85, Tan96, CC06, CO15]. Since
such groups arise as tangent cones of sub-Riemannian manifolds then the regularity of
1-quasiconformal maps in Carnot groups setting is an analogue of the Euclidean case as
studied by Gehring and Reˇsetnjak. To further describe the present work we begin with the
introduction of the notions of conformal and quasiconformal maps between sub-Riemannian
manifolds (see Section 2.1 for the relevant deﬁnitions).

Deﬁnition 1.1 (Conformal map). A smooth diﬀeomorphism between two sub-Riemannian
manifolds is conformal if its diﬀerential maps horizontal vectors into horizontal vectors, and
its restrictions to the horizontal spaces are similarities1.

The notion of quasiconformality can be formulated with minimal regularity assumptions

in arbitrary metric spaces.

Deﬁnition 1.2 (Quasiconformal map). A quasiconformal map between two metric spaces
(X, dX ) and (Y, dY ) is a homeomorphism f : X → Y for which there exists a constant
K ≥ 1 such that for all p ∈ X

Hf (p) := lim sup

r→0

sup{dY (f (p), f (q)) : dX(p, q) ≤ r}
inf{dY (f (p), f (q)) : dX(p, q) ≥ r}

≤ K.

We want to clarify what is the correct deﬁnition of 1-quasiconformality since in the
literature there are several equivalent deﬁnitions of quasiconformality associated to possibly
diﬀerent bounds for diﬀerent types of distortion (metric, geometric, or analytic).

In order to state our results we need to recall a few basic notions and introduce some

notation. We consider the following metric quantities

Lf (p) := lim sup

q→p

d(f (p), f (q))

d(p, q)

and

ℓf (p) := lim inf
q→p

d(f (p), f (q))

d(p, q)

.

The quantity Lf (p) is sometimes denoted by Lipf (p) and is called the pointwise Lipschitz
constant. Given an equiregular sub-Riemannian manifold M , we denote by Q its Hausdorﬀ

1A map F : X → Y between metric spaces is called a similarity if there exists a constant λ > 0 such that

d(F (x), F (x′)) = λd(x, x′), for all x, x′

∈ X.

dimension with respect to the Carnot-Carath´eodory distance, and we write ∇H for the
horizontal gradient, see Section 2.1 for these deﬁnitions. We denote by volM the Popp
measure on M and denote by JPopp
the Jacobian of a map f between equiregular sub-
Riemannian manifolds when these manifolds are equipped with their Popp measures (see
Section 3.4). By W 1,Q
H (M ) we indicate the space of functions u ∈ LQ(volM ) such that
|∇Hu| ∈ LQ(volM ). We use the standard notation CapQ and ModQ for capacity and
modulus (see Section 3.7). We also consider the nonlinear pairing

f

IQ(u, φ; U ) := ZU

|∇Hu|Q−2h∇Hu, ∇Hφi d volM ,

with u, φ ∈ W 1,Q
H (U ) and U ⊂ M an open subset. For short, we write IQ(u, φ) for
IQ(u, φ; M ) and denote by EQ(u) = IQ(u, u; M ) the Q-energy of u. The functional IQ(u, · )
deﬁnes the weak form of the Q-Laplacian when acting on the appropriate function space,
see Section 2.4. Given a quasiconformal homeomorphism f between two equiregular sub-
Riemannian manifolds, we denote by Np(f ) the Margulis-Mostow diﬀerential of f and by
(dH f )p its horizontal diﬀerential (see Section 3.2).

manifolds of Hausdorﬀ dimension Q. The following are equivalent:

two equiregular sub-Riemannian manifolds is 1-quasiconformal if any of the conditions in
Theorem 1.3 holds.

∀ V ⊂ N open, ∀ v, φ ∈ W 1,Q

The equivalence of the deﬁnitions in Theorem 1.3 have as consequences some invariance

properties that are crucial in the proofs of this paper.

Corollary 1.14. Let f be a 1-quasiconformal map between equiregular sub-Riemannian
manifolds of Hausdorﬀ dimension Q. Then

(i) the Q-energy (w.r.t. Popp measure) is preserved:

(1.15)

EQ(v) = EQ(v ◦ f ),

∀ v ∈ W 1,Q

H (N );

(ii) the Q-capacity (w.r.t. Popp measure) is preserved:

(1.16)

CapQ(E, F ) = CapQ(f (E), f (F )),

∀ E, F ⊂ M compact.

The proofs of Theorem 1.3 and Corollary 1.14 are given in Section 3. A detailed guide to

such proofs in contained at the beginning of that section.

While the Hausdorﬀ measure may seem to be the natural volume measure to use in this
context, there is a subtle and important reason for choosing the Popp measure rather than
the Hausdorﬀ measure.
Indeed, the latter may not be smooth, even in equiregular sub-
Riemannian manifolds, see [ABB12]. However, we show that for 1-quasiconformal maps the
corresponding Jacobians coincide. The following statement is a consequence of Theorem 1.3
and Proposition 3.37.

Corollary 1.17. Let f be a 1-quasiconformal map between equiregular sub-Riemannian
manifolds of Hausdorﬀ dimension Q. Then for almost every p

ℓf (p)Q = Lf (p)Q = JPopp

f

(p) = JHaus

f

(p).

Moreover, the inverse map f −1 is 1-quasiconformal.

Since the Popp measure is smooth, the associated Q-Laplacian operator LQ will involve
smooth coeﬃcients and consequently it is plausible to conjecture the existence of a regularity
theory of Q-harmonic functions (see Section 2.4 for the deﬁnitions). In fact such a theory
exists in the important subclass of contact manifolds (see Section 6.2). The following result
is the morphism property for 1-quasiconformal maps, and it is proved in Section 3.8. The
Q-Laplacian operator LQ is deﬁned in (2.15).

Corollary 1.18 (Morphism property). Let f : M → N be a 1-quasiconformal map between
equiregular sub-Riemannian manifolds of Hausdorﬀ dimension Q equipped with their Popp
measures. The following hold:

(i) The Q-Laplacian is preserved:

If v ∈ W 1,Q

H (N ), then LQ(v ◦ f ) ◦ f ∗ = LQv, where f ∗ denotes the pull-back

operator on functions.

(ii) The Q-harmonicity is preserved:

If v is a Q-harmonic function on N , then v ◦ f is a Q-harmonic function on M .

One of the main results of this paper is the following Liouville-type theorem. Its proof is

the content of Section 6.

Theorem 1.19. Every 1-quasiconformal map between sub-Riemannian contact manifolds
is conformal.

CONFORMALITY IN SUB-RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS

For some related results in the setting of CR 3-manifolds see [Tan96]. As a sample ap-
plication of Theorem 1.19 we recall the following two examples of contact sub-Riemannian
manifolds. Consider the roto-translation group (i.e., the isometry group of the Euclidean
plane) and the Heisenberg group, both equipped with their standard sub-Riemannian struc-
tures. They are locally quasiconformal (in fact they admit a global map that is locally
bi-Lipschitz, with an explicit correspondence that can be found in [FKL14]). Theorem 1.19
shows that such local equivalence cannot be extended to 1-quasiconformality. In fact, if this
was the case, then the two spaces would be locally conformal, but they are not, in view of
a recent result of Boarotto [Boa16].

Theorem 1.19 follows from a more general theorem. In fact, it continues to hold in the class
of sub-Riemannian manifolds that support a regularity theory for Q-harmonic functions.
This class includes every sub-Riemannian manifold that is locally contactomorphic to a
Carnot group of step 2 or, equivalently, every Carnot group of step 2 with a sub-Riemannian
metric that is not necessarily left-invariant. We remark that there are examples of step-2
sub-Riemannian manifolds that are not contactomorphic to any Carnot group, see [LOW14].
In order to describe in detail the more general result we introduce the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 1.20. Consider an equiregular sub-Riemannian manifold M of Hausdorﬀ di-
mension Q endowed with a smooth volume form. We say that M supports regularity for
Q-harmonic functions if the following two properties hold:

(1) For every U ⊂⊂ M and for every ℓ > 0, there exist constants α ∈ (0, 1), C > 0 such

that for each Q-harmonic function u on M with ||u||W 1,Q

H (U ) < ℓ, one has

||u||C1,α

H (U ) ≤ C.

(2) For every U ⊂⊂ M and for every ℓ, ℓ′ > 0, there exists a constant C > 0 such that
ℓ′ < |∇Hu| < ℓ′ on

for each Q-harmonic function u on M with ||u||W 1,Q
U , one has

H (U ) < ℓ and 1

||u||W 2,2

H (U ) ≤ C.

i=1 X∗

PDE Pr

In view of the work of Uraltseva [Ura68] (but see also[Uhl77, Tol84, DiB83]) every Rie-
mannian manifold supports regularity for Q-harmonic functions. Things are less clear
in the sub-Riemannian setting. The H¨older regularity of weak solutions of quasilinear
I A(x, ∇H u) = 0, modeled on the subelliptic p-Laplacian, for 1 < p <
∞, and for their parabolic counterpart,
is well known, see [CDG93, ACCN14]. How-
ever, in this generality the higher regularity of solutions is still an open problem. The
only results in the literature are for the case when A(x, ξ) does not depend on x and
the vector ﬁelds are those corresponding to the Heisenberg group. Under these assump-
tions one has that solutions in the range p ≥ 2 have H¨older regular horizontal gradient.
This is a formidable achievement in itself, building on contributions by several authors
[Cap97, Dom04, DFDFM05, MM07, DM09a, MZGZ09, DM09b], with the ﬁnal result being
established eventually by Zhong in [Zho10]. Beyond the Heisenberg group one has some
promising results due to Domokos and Manfredi [Dom08, DM10b, DM10a] in the range of p
near 2. In this paper we build on these previous contributions, particularly on Zhong’s work
[Zho10] to include the dependence on x and prove that contact sub-Riemannian manifolds

8

support regularity for Q-harmonic functions (see Theorem 6.15). Note that very recently
Zhong and Mukherjee have announced the extension of the regularity result to the range
1 < p ≤ 2, while Citti, Garofalo, Markasheva and the ﬁrst-named author [CCGM16] have
extended Zhong’s theorem to the parabolic case. The novelty of our approach is that we use
a Riemannian approximation scheme to regularize the Q-Laplacian operator, thus allowing
to approximate its solutions with smooth functions. In carrying out this approximation the
main diﬃculty is to show that the regularity estimates do not blow up as the approximating
parameter approaches the critical case.

The regularity hypotheses in Deﬁnition 1.20 have two important consequences. First, it al-
lows us to construct horizontal Q-harmonic coordinates. Second, together with the existence
of such coordinates, it eventually leads to an initial C 1,α regularity for 1-quasiconformal
maps (see Theorem 1.21.(ii)). When this basic regularity is present, one can use classical
PDE arguments to derive smoothness without the additional hypothesis of Deﬁnition 1.20
(see Theorem 1.21.(i)).

Theorem 1.21. Let f : M → N be a 1-quasiconformal map between equiregular sub-
Riemannian manifolds of Hausdorﬀ dimension Q, endowed with smooth volume forms.

(i) If f is bi-Lipschitz and in C 1,α
(ii) If M and N support regularity for Q-harmonic functions (in the sense of Deﬁni-
H,loc(M, N ), and hence conformal.

tion 1.20), then f is bi-Lipschitz and in C 1,α

H,loc(M, N )∩ W 2,2

H,loc(M, N ) ∩ W 2,2

H,loc(M, N ), then f is conformal .

The function spaces in Theorem 1.21 are deﬁned componentwise, see Section 5. Theo-

rem 1.21.(i) is proved in Section 5.1. Theorem 1.21.(ii) is proved in Section 5.2.

The above theorem provides the following result.

Corollary 1.22. Let f be a homeomorphism between two equiregular sub-Riemannian man-
ifolds each supporting the regularity estimates in Deﬁnition 1.20. The map f is conformal
if and only if it is 1-quasiconformal.

Remark 1.23. Note that in view of the regularity theory in the work of Uraltseva [Ura68], we
recover Ferrand’s theorem (and the Liimatainen–Salo argument): every 1-quasiconformal
map between Riemannian manifolds is conformal.

The proof of the ﬁrst part of Theorem 1.21 rests on the morphism property for 1-
quasiconformal maps (see Theorem 1.18) and on Schauder’s estimates, as developed by
Rothschild and Stein [RS76] and Xu [Xu92]. The second part is one of the main contribu-
tions of this paper and is based on the construction of ad-hoc systems of coordinates, the
horizontal Q-harmonic coordinates, that play an analogue role to that of the n-harmonic
coordinates in the work of Liimatainen–Salo [LS14]. However, in contrast to the Riemann-
ian setting, only a subset of the coordinate systems (the horizontal components) can be
constructed so that they are Q-harmonic, but not the remaining ones. This yields a po-
tential obstacle, as Q-harmonicity is the key to the smoothness of the map. We remedy
to this potential drawback by producing an argument showing that if an ACC map has
suitably regular horizontal components then such regularity is transferred to all the other
components (see Proposition 4.14). This method was introduced in [CC06] in the special

CONFORMALITY IN SUB-RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS

9

setting of Carnot groups, where Q-harmonic horizontal coordinates arise naturally as the
exponential coordinates associated to the ﬁrst layer of the stratiﬁcation.

We conclude this introduction with a comparison between our work and the Carnot
group case as studied in [CC06]. In the latter setting one has that all the canonical ex-
ponential horizontal coordinates happen to be also smooth Q-harmonic (in fact they are
also harmonic). Moreover, a simple argument based on the existence of dilations and the
1-quasiconformal invariance of the conformal capacity (see [Pan89]) yields the bi-Lipschitz
regularity for 1-quasiconformal maps immediately, without having to invoke any PDE re-
sult. As a consequence the Liouville theorem in the Carnot group case can be proved relying
on a much weaker regularity theory than the one above, i.e., one has just to use the C 1,α
estimates for the Q-Laplacian in the simpler case where the gradient is bounded away from
zero and from inﬁnity. This result goes back to the earlier work of the ﬁrst-named author
[Cap99] in the Carnot group setting. In our more general, non-group setting, there are no
canonical Q-harmonic coordinates, and so one has to invoke the PDE regularity to construct
them. Similarly, the lack of dilations makes it necessary to rely on the PDE regularity also
to show bi-Lipschitz regularity.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Sub-Riemannian geometry. A sub-Riemannian manifold is a connected, smooth
manifold M endowed with a subbundle HM of the tangent bundle T M that bracket gener-
ates T M and a smooth section of positive-deﬁnite quadratic forms g on HM , see [Mon02].
The form g is locally completely determined by any orthonormal frame X1, . . . , Xr of HM .
The bundle HM is called horizontal distribution. The section g is called sub-Riemannian
metric.

Analogously to the Riemannian setting, one can endow a sub-Riemannian manifold M
with a metric space structure by deﬁning the Carnot-Carath´eodory distance: For any pair
x, y ∈ M set

d(x, y) = inf{δ > 0 such that there exists a curve γ ∈ C ∞([0, 1]; M ) with endpoints x, y
such that ˙γ ∈ HγM and | ˙γ|g ≤ δ}.

Consider a sub-Riemannian manifold M with horizontal distribution HM and denote by
Γ(HM ) the smooth sections of HM , i.e., the vector ﬁelds tangent to HM . For all k ∈ N,
consider

H kM := [q∈M

span{[Y1, [Y2, [. . . [Yl−1, Yl]]]]q : l ≤ k, Yj ∈ Γ(HM ), j = 1, . . . , l}.

The bracket generating condition (also called H¨ormander’s ﬁnite rank hypothesis) is ex-
pressed by the existence of s ∈ N such that H sM = T M .

Deﬁnition 2.1. A sub-Riemannian manifold M with horizontal distribution HM is equireg-
ular if, for all k ∈ N, each set H kM deﬁnes a subbundle of T M .

Consider the metric space (M, d) where M with horizontal distribution ∆ is an equiregular
sub-Riemannian manifold and d is the corresponding Carnot-Carath´eodory distance. As a
consequence of Chow-Rashevsky Theorem such a distance is always ﬁnite and induces on
M the original topology. As a result of Mitchell [Mit85], the Hausdorﬀ dimension of (M, d)
coincides with the Hausdorﬀ dimension of its tangents spaces.

Let X1, . . . , Xr be an orthonormal frame of the horizontal distribution of a sub-Riemannian
manifold M . We deﬁne the horizontal gradient of a function u : M → R with respect to
X1, . . . , Xr as

the matrix B(p) would be in O(r) for every p.

r are two frames that are orthonormal with respect
Hu = ∇Hu. Indeed, in this case

2.2. PDE preliminaries. In this section we collect some of the PDE results that will be
used later in the paper. Let X1, . . . , Xr be an orthonormal frame of the horizontal bundle
of a sub-Riemannian manifold M . For each i = 1, . . . , r denote by X∗
i the adjoint of Xi
with respect to a smooth volume form vol, i.e.,

ZM

uXiφ d vol = ZM

X∗

i uφ d vol,

for every compactly supported φ for which the integral is ﬁnite. In any system of coordinates,
the smooth volume form can be expressed in terms of the Lebesgue measure L through a
k∂k, then

smooth density ω, i.e., d vol = ω d L. If in local coordinates we write Xi = Pn

one has

k=1 bi

Next we deﬁne some of the function spaces that will be used in the paper.

Deﬁnition 2.6. Let X1, . . . , Xr be an orthonormal frame of the horizontal bundle of a sub-
Riemannian manifold M and consider an open subset Ω ⊂ M . For any k ∈ N, and α ∈ (0, 1)

where, for each m = 0, . . . , k and each m-tuple I = (i1, . . . , im) ∈ {1, . . . , r}m, we have

C k,α

H (Ω) = nu : Ω → R : X I u is continuous in Ω for |I| ≤ k and kukCk,α

H (Ω) < ∞o .

A function u is in C k,α

H,loc(Ω), if for any K ⊂⊂ Ω one has kukCk,α

H (K) < ∞.

Deﬁnition 2.7. Let X1, . . . , Xr be an orthonormal frame of the horizontal bundle of a sub-
Riemannian manifold M and consider an open subset Ω ⊂ M . For k ∈ N and for any
multi-index I = (i1, ..., ik) ∈ {1, ..., r}k we deﬁne |I| = k and X I u = Xi1...Xik u. For
p ∈ [1, ∞) we deﬁne the horizontal Sobolev space W k,p
H (Ω) to be the space of all u ∈ Lp(Ω)
whose distributional derivatives X I u are also in Lp(Ω) for all multi-indexes |I| ≤ k. This
space can also be deﬁned as the closure of the space of C ∞(Ω) functions with respect to
the norm

2.3. Schauder estimates. Here we discuss Schauder estimates for second order, non-
divergence form subelliptic linear operators. Given an orthonormal frame X1, . . . , Xr of the
horizontal bundle of M , one deﬁnes the subLaplacian on M of a function u as

(2.9)

L2u :=

X∗

i Xiu.

r

Xi=1

One can check that such an operator does not depend on the choice of the orthonormal
frame, but only on the sub-Riemannian structure of M and the choice of the volume form.
Let Ω be an open set of M . A function u : Ω → R is called 2-harmonic (or, more
simply, harmonic) if L2u = 0 in Ω, in the sense of distribution. H¨ormander’s celebrated
Hypoellipticity Theorem [H¨or67] implies that harmonic functions are smooth.

A well known result of Rothschild and Stein [RS76], yields Schauder estimates for sub-
H(Ω), then for any K ⊂⊂ Ω, there exists a constant C

Laplacians, that is if L2u ∈ C α
depending on K, α and the sub-Riemannian structure such that

kukC2,α

H (K) ≤ CkL2ukCα

H(Ω).

In particular we shall use that

The Schauder estimates have been extended to subelliptic operators with low regularity by
a number of authors. For our purposes we will consider operators of the form

La(x)u(x) :=

r

Xi,j=1

aij(x)XiXju(x),

where aij is a symmetric matrix such that for some constants λ, Λ > 0 one has

(2.11)
for every x ∈ M and for all ξ ∈ Rr. We recall a version of the classical Schauder estimates
as established in [Xu92]

λ|ξ|2 ≤ aij(x)ξiξj ≤ Λ|ξ|2

Proposition 2.12. Let u ∈ C 2,α
H,loc(M ), then u ∈ C k+2,α
C k,α
C = C(U, α, k, X) such that

H,loc(M ) for some α ∈ (0, 1). Let aij ∈ C k,α

H,loc(M ). If Lau ∈
H,loc (M ) and for every U ⊂⊂ M there exists a positive constant

||u||Ck+2,α(U ) ≤ C||Lu||Ck,α(M ).

In a similar spirit, the Schauder estimates hold for any operator of the form Lu =
i,j=1 aij(x)X∗
i denotes the adjoint of Xi with respect to some ﬁxed smooth

i Xju where X∗

Pr

volume form.

Next, following an argument originally introduced by Agmon, Douglis and Nirenberg
[ADN59, Theorem A.5.1] in the Euclidean setting, we show that one can lift the burden of
the a-priori regularity hypothesis from the Schauder estimates.
Lemma 2.13. Let α ∈ (0, 1) and assume that u ∈ W 2,2
a.e. x ∈ M

H,loc(M ) is a function that satisﬁes for

LA(x)u(x) =

aij(x)XiXju(x) ∈ C α

H,loc(M ).

r

Xi,j=1

If aij ∈ C α

H,loc(M ), then u is in fact a C 2,α

H,loc(M ) function.

Proof. The strategy in [ADN59] consists in setting up a bootstrap argument through which
the integrability of the weak second order derivatives XiXju of the solution increases until,
in a ﬁnite number of steps, one achieves that they are continuous. At this point ones invokes
a standard extension of a classical result of Hopf [Hop32] or [ADN59, page 723] (for a proof
in the subelliptic setting see for instance Bramanti et al., [BBLU10, Theorem 14.4]) which
yields the last step in regularity, i.e., if XiXju are continuous then u ∈ C 2,α

H,loc.

For a ﬁxed p0 ∈ M consider the frozen coeﬃcients operator

LA(p0)w =

r

Xi,j=1

aij(p0)XiXjw.

For sake of simplicity we will write Lp, Lp0 for LA(p), LA(p0). Denote by Γp0(p, q) the fun-
damental solution of Lp0. For ﬁxed r > 0, consider a smooth function η ∈ C ∞
0 (B(p0, 2r))
such that η = 1 in B(p0, r). For any p ∈ M and any smooth function w one has

η(p)w(p) = Z Γp0(p, q)Lp0(ηw)(q) d vol(q).

CONFORMALITY IN SUB-RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS

13

Diﬀerentiating the latter along two horizontal vector ﬁelds Xi, Xj i, j = 1, . . . , r one obtains
that for any p ∈ B(p0, r)

Xi,pu(p) = Z ñXi,pΓp0(p, q)Lq(uη) + Xi,pΓp0(p, q)(Lp0 − Lq)uη(q)ô d vol(q),

and

Xi,pXj,pu(p) = Z ñXi,pXj,pΓp0(p, q)Lq(uη)+Xi,pXj,pΓp0(p, q)(Lp0−Lq)uη(q)ô d vol(q)+C(p0)Lp(uη),

where Xi,p denotes diﬀerentiation in the variable p and C is a H¨older continuous function
arising from the principal value of the integral.

Setting p = p0 one obtains the identity

(2.14)

Xi,pXj,pu(p) = Z ñXi,pXj,pΓp(p, q)Lq(uη)+Xi,pXj,pΓp(p, q)(Lp−Lq)uη(q)ô d vol(q)+C(p0)Lp(uη),

where the diﬀerentiation in the ﬁrst term in the integrand is intended in the ﬁrst set of
the argument variables only. The next task is to show that identity (2.14) holds also for
functions in W 2,2
H , in the sense that the diﬀerence between the two sides has L2 norm zero.
To see this we consider a sequence of smooth approximations wn → u ∈ W 2,2
H norm.
To guarantee convergence we observe that in view of the work in [RS76] and [NSW85],
the expression Xi,pXj,pΓp(p, q) is a Calderon-Zygmund kernel. To prove our claim it is
then suﬃcient to invoke the boundedness between Lebesgue spaces of Calderon-Zygmund
operators in the setting of homogenous spaces (see [CW71]), and [DH95]).

H in W 2,2

Our next goal is to show an improvement in the integrability of the second derivatives of

the solution u ∈ W 2,2

H . We write

Xi,pXj,pu(p) = I1 + I2 + I3 + I4

where

I1(p) = Z Xi,pXj,pΓp(p, q)η(q)Lqu(q) d vol(q) + C(p)Lpu(p),

I2(p) = Z Xi,pXj,pΓp(p, q)

r

Xi,j=1

aij(q)Xiη(q)Xju(q) + u(q)

r

Xi,j=1

aij(q)XiXjη(q) d vol(q),

I3(p) = Z Xi,pXj,pΓp(p, q)

r

Xi,j=1

(aij(p) − aij(q))XiXj(ηu) d vol(q).

Since Lu ∈ C α and in view of the continuity of singular integral operators in H¨older spaces
(see Rothschild and Stein [RS76]) then I1 ∈ C α and we can disregard this term in our
argument.

Next we turn our attention to I2 and I3. Since u ∈ W 2,2 then Sobolev embedding theorem

[HK00] yields ∇Hu ∈ L
operators in homogenous spaces one has I2 ∈ L

In view of the estimates on the fundamental solution for sublaplacians by Nagel, Stein

and Wainger [NSW85], one has that

|XiXjΓp(p, q)| sup
i,j

|aij(p) − aij(q)| ≤ C(K)d(p, q)α−Q,

for every q ∈ K ⊂⊂ M . One can then bound I3 with fractional integral operators

Iα(ψ)(p) := Z d(p, q)α−Qψ(q)dvol(q).

In the context of homogenous spaces (see for instance [CW71]), these operators are bounded
between the Lebesgue spaces Lβ → Lγ with 1

In view of such continuity we infer that I3 ∈ L2κ with Q
In conclusion, so far we have showed that if u ∈ W 2,2

H,loc(M ) is a solution of Lpu(p) ∈ C α

then one has the integrability gain u ∈ W
(M ). Iterating this process for a ﬁnite
number of steps, in the manner described in [ADN59, page 721-722], one can increase
the integrability exponent until it is larger than α/Q and at that point the fractional
integral operators maps into a H¨older space and one ﬁnally has that XiXju are continuous.
As described above, to complete the proof one now invokes Bramanti et al., [BBLU10,
Theorem 14.4].

2.4. Subelliptic Q-Laplacian and C ∞ estimates for non-degeneracy. Denote by Q

Since u ∈ W 2,2

form

where

and

(LQu)(x) = αij(x, ∇Hu)XiXju + g(x, ∇Hu) = h(x),

αij(x, ξ) = −|ξ|Q−4(δij + (Q − 2))ξiξj

g(x, ξ) = −ω(x)−1Xiω(x)|ξ|Q−2ξi + ∂kbi

Set aij(x) = αij(x, ∇Hu). Since u ∈ C 1,α

H,loc(M ), we have
aij(·) and g( · , ∇Hu) ∈ C α

H,loc(M ).

In view of the non-vanishing of ∇Hu, one can invoke Lemma 2.13, to obtain u ∈ C 2,α

H,loc(M ).

we show the equivalence of the deﬁnitions (1.4) - (1.12) of 1-quasiconformal maps, and show
how (1.15) and (1.16) are consequences. To help the reader, we provide the following road

3.1. Ultratangents of 1-quasiconformal maps. We refer the reader who is not familiar
with the notions of nonprincipal ultraﬁlters and ultralimits to Chapter 9 of Kapovich’s book
[Kap09]. Roughly speaking, taking ultralimits with respect to a nonprincipal ultraﬁlter is a
consistent way of using the axiom of choice to select an accumulation point of any bounded
sequence of real numbers. Let ω be a nonprincipal ultraﬁlter. Given a sequence Xj of
metric spaces with base points ⋆j ∈ Xj, we shall consider the based ultralimit metric space

(Xω, ⋆ω) := (Xj, ⋆j )ω := lim
j→ω

(Xj, ⋆j ).

We recall brieﬂy the construction. Let

X N

b := {(pj)j∈N : pj ∈ Xj, sup{d(pj , ⋆j) : j ∈ N} < ∞} .

For all (pj)j, (qj)j ∈ X N

b , set

dω((pj)j, (qj)j) := lim
j→ω

dj(pj, qj),

where limj→ω denotes the ω-limit of a sequence indexed by j. Then Xω is the metric space
obtained by taking the quotient of (X N
b , dω) by the semidistance dω. We denote by [pj] the
equivalence class of (pj)j. The base point ⋆ω in Xω is [⋆j].

Suppose fj : Xj → Yj are maps between metric spaces, ⋆j ∈ Xj are base points, and we
b . Then the ultraﬁlter ω assigns a

have the property that (fj(pj))j ∈ Y N
limit map fω := limj→ω fj : (Xj, ⋆j )ω → (Yj, fj(⋆j))ω as fω([pj]) := [fj(pj)].

b , for all (pj)j ∈ X N

Let X be a metric space with distance dX . We ﬁx a nonprincipal ultraﬁlter ω, a base
point ⋆ ∈ X, and a sequence of positive numbers λj → ∞ as j → ∞. We deﬁne the
ultratangent at ⋆ of X as

Tω(X, ⋆) := lim
j→ω

(X, λjdX , ⋆).

Moreover, given f : (X, dX ) → (Y, dY ), we call the ultratangent map of f at ⋆ the limit,
whenever it exists, of the maps f : (X, λj dX , ⋆) → (Y, λj dY , f (⋆)), denoted Tω(f, ⋆).

Lemma 3.1. Let X and Y be geodesic metric spaces and let f : X → Y be a quasiconformal
map satisfying Hf (⋆) = 1 at some point ⋆ ∈ X. Fix a nonprincipal ultraﬁlter ω and dilations
factors λj → ∞. If the ultratangent map fω = Tω(f, ⋆) exists, then for p, q ∈ Tω(X, ⋆)

d(⋆ω, p) = d(⋆ω, q) =⇒ d(fω(⋆ω), fω(p)) = d(fω(⋆ω), fω(q)).

Proof. Take p = [pj], q = [qj] ∈ Tω(X, ⋆) with d(⋆ω, p) = d(⋆ω, q) =: R. Namely,

lim
j→ω

λjd(⋆, pj ) = lim
j→ω

λjd(⋆, qj ) = R.

Set rj := min{d(⋆, pj ), d(⋆, qj )}. Fix j and suppose rj = d(⋆, pj ) so rj ≤ d(⋆, qj ). Since Y

is geodesic, there exists q′

j ∈ X along a geodesic between ⋆ and qj with

d(⋆, q′

j ) = rj

and

d(qj, q′

j) = d(⋆, qj) − rj.

We claim that [q′

j] = [qj]. Indeed,

dω([q′

j], [qj]) = lim
j→ω
= lim

= lim
j→ω

λjd(q′

j, qj)

λj(d(⋆, qj ) − rj)

λjd(⋆, qj ) − λjd(⋆, pj )

= R − R = 0.

Reasoning similarly with pj’s, we may conclude that p = [p′
d(⋆, q′

j ) = rj. Hence, by deﬁnition of fω we have fω(p) = fω([p′

j] and q = [q′
j]) = [fj(p′

j] with d(⋆, p′

j) =
j)] and fω(q) =

CONFORMALITY IN SUB-RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS

fω([q′

j)]. We then calculate

dω(fω(⋆ω), fω(p))
dω(fω(⋆ω), fω(q))

Arguing along the same lines one obtains dω(fω(⋆ω), fω(q)) ≤ dω(fω(⋆ω), fω(p)) and hence
the statement of the lemma follows.
(cid:3)

3.2. Tangents of quasiconformal maps in sub-Riemannian geometry. We recall
now some known results due to Mitchell [Mit85] and Margulis, Mostow [MM95], which
are needed to show that every 1-quasiconformal map induces at almost every point a 1-
quasiconformal isomorphism of the relative ultratangents. For the sake of our argument,
we rephrase their results using the convenient language of ultraﬁlters.

Let M be an equiregular sub-Riemannian manifold. From [Mit85], for every p ∈ M the
ultratangent Tω(M, p) is isometric to a Carnot group, denoted Np(M ), also called nilpotent
approximation of M at p. Each horizontal vector of M at p has a natural identiﬁcation with
an horizontal vector of Np(M ) at the identity. Such identiﬁcation is an isometry between the
horizontal space HpM and the horizontal space of Np(M ) at the identity, both equipped
with the scalar products given by respective sub-Riemannian structures. Next, consider
f : M → N a quasiconformal map between equiregular sub-Riemannian manifolds M and
N . By the work of Margulis and Mostow [MM95], there exists at almost every p ∈ M the
ultratangent map Tω(f, p) that is a group isomorphism

Np(f ) : Np(M ) → Nf (p)(N )

that commutes with the group dilations, and it is independent on the ultraﬁlter ω and the
sequence λj. Part of Margulis and Mostow’s result is that the map f is almost everywhere
diﬀerenziable along horizontal vectors. Hence, for almost every p ∈ M and for all horizontal
vectors v at p, we can consider the push-forwarded vector, which we denote by (dH f )p(v).
We call the map

(dH f )p : HpM → Hf (p)N

the horizontal diﬀerential of f at p.

Remark 3.2. With the above identiﬁcation, we have

(3.3)

(dH f )p(v) = Np(f )∗v,

∀v ∈ HpM,

so (dH f )p is a restriction of Np(f )∗. Vice versa, (dH f )p completely determines Np(f ),
since Np(f ) is a homomorphism and HpM generates the Lie algebra of Np(M ). In partic-
ular, (dH f )p is a similarity if and only if Np(f ) is a similarity with same factor. Hence,
Conditions (1.7) and (1.6) are equivalent.

Remark 3.4. There exists a horizontal vector at p such that kXk = 1 and kf∗Xk = kNp(f )k,
which in other words means that X is in the ﬁrst layer of the Carnot group Np(M ),
dNp(M )(e, exp(X)) = 1, and dNf (p)(N )(e, Np(f )(exp(X))) = kNp(f )k.

The following holds.

Lemma 3.5. Let M and N be (equiregular) sub-Riemannian manifolds and let f : M → N
be a quasiconformal map. Let p be a point of diﬀerentiability for f . We have

Lf (p) = kNp(f )k = LNp(f )(e) = Lf (p) = Lf (p) = L=

f (p) = L=

f (p).

Proof. Proof of Lf (p) ≤ kNp(f )k. Let pj ∈ M such that pj → p and

Lf (p) = lim

d(f (p), f (pj))

d(p, pj)

.

Let λj := 1/d(p, pj ), so λj → ∞. We ﬁx now any nonprincipal ultraﬁlter ω and consider
ultratangents with respect to dilations λj. Hence,

Proof of Lf (p) ≥ kNp(f )k. Take y ∈ Np(M ) with d(e, y) = 1 that realizes the maximum
in kNp(f )k. Choose a sequence qj ∈ M such that [qj] represents the point y. Let λj → ∞
be the dilations factors for which we calculate the ultratangent. Since

Then, using 1/rj as scaling for the ultratangent, we have dω([p], [pj ]) ≤ 1 and Lf (p) =

Proof of kNp(f )k ≤ Lf (p). Take y ∈ Np(M ) with dNp(M )(e, y) ≤ 1 that realizes the
maximum in kNp(f )k. Choose subsequences sj → 0 that realizes the limit in the deﬁnition
of Lf (p), i.e., so that

Lf (p) = lim

We use 1/sj as scaling factors for the ultratangent space. For any µ ∈ (0, 1) choose a

sequence qj ∈ M such that [qj] represents the point δµ(y). Therefore, we have that

lim

dM (p, qj)

sj

= dNp(M )(e, δµ(y)) ≤ µdNp(M )(e, y) ≤ µ < 1.

For j big enough we then have dM (p, qj) < sj. So

dN (f (p), f (qj)) ≤ sup{dN (f (p), f (q)) : dM (p, q) ≤ sj},

whence, dividing both sides by sj and letting j → ∞, we get

dω([f (p)], [f (qj)]) ≤ Lf (p),

which, in view of the homogeneity of Np(f ), yields

Since the last inequality holds for all µ ∈ (0, 1), the conclusion follows.

µ kNp(f )k = dNp(M )(e, Np(f )(δµy)) ≤ Lf (p).

Proof of Lf (p) ≥ L=

f (p). Since

sup{dN (f (p), f (q)) : dM (p, q) ≤ r} ≥ sup{dN (f (p), f (q)) : dM (p, q) = r},

Proof. Note that in every geodesic metric space

inf{dN (f (p), f (q)) : dM (p, q) ≥ r} = inf{dN (f (p), f (q)) : dM (p, q) = r}.

Hence Hf (p) ≥ H =

(cid:3)

Proposition 3.10. Let f : M → N be a quasiconformal map between sub-Riemannian man-
ifolds. The function p 7→ kNp(f )k is the minimal upper-gradient of f .

Proof. The function p 7→ kNp(f )k is an upper-gradient of f since Lf (·) is such and Lf (p) =
kNp(f )k by Lemma 3.5 . Regarding the minimality, let g be a weak upper-gradient of f .
We need to show that

(3.11)

g(p) ≥ kNp(f )k ,

for almost all p.

Localizing, we take a unit horizontal vector ﬁeld X. For p ∈ M , let γp be the curve deﬁned
by the ﬂow of X, i.e.,

γp(t) := Φt

X(p),

which is deﬁned for t small enough. We remark that the subfamilies of {γp}p∈M that have
zero Q-modulus are of the form {γp}p∈E with E ⊂ M of zero Q-measure. Then, for every

22

LUCA CAPOGNA, ENRICO LE DONNE, AND ALESSANDRO OTTAZZI

unit horizontal vector ﬁeld X, there exists a set ΩX ⊆ M of full measure such that for all
p ∈ ΩX we have

Since kXk ≡ 1, then each γp is parametrized by arc length. Thus

Assuming that p is a Lebesgue point for g, taking the limit as ǫ → 0, and considering
ultratangents with dilations 1/ǫ, we have

(3.12)

g(p) ≥ dω(e, Np(f )[Φǫ

X(p)]),
= dω(e, Np(f ) exp( ˜Xp)),

∀p ∈ ΩX,

where ˜Xp is the vector induced on Np(M ) by Xp.

Set now X1, . . . Xr an orthonormal frame of ∆ and consider for all θ ∈ Sr−1 ⊂ Rr, the
i=1 θiXi. Fix {θj}j∈N a countable dense subset of Sr−1
and deﬁne Ω := ∩jΩX θj , which has full measure. Take p ∈ Ω and, recalling Remark 3.4,
take Y ∈ ∆p such that kY k = 1 and

unit horizontal vector ﬁeld X θ := Pr

dω(e, Np(f ) exp( ˜Y )) = kNp(f )k

By density, there exists a sequence jk of integers such that θjk converges to some θ with the
property that Y = (X θ)p. Therefore, by (3.12) we conclude (3.11).
(cid:3)

3.3. Equivalence of metric deﬁnitions.

Proposition 3.13 (Tangents of 1-QC maps). Let f : M → N be a quasiconformal map
between equiregular sub-Riemannian manifolds. Condition (1.4) implies Condition (1.7).

Proof. For almost every p ∈ M , the map Np(f ) exists and coincides with the ultratangent
fω with respect to any nonprincipal ultraﬁlter and any sequence of dilations. Hence, we can
apply Lemma 3.1 and deduce that spheres about the origin are sent to spheres about the
origin. Therefore, the distortion HNp(f )(e) at the origin is 1. Being Np(f ) an isomorphism,
the distortion is 1 at every point, and in fact Np(f ) is a similarity.

(cid:3)

Corollary 3.14. Let f : M → N be a quasiconformal map between equiregular sub-Riemannian
manifolds. Conditions (1.7), (1.8), and (1.9) are equivalent.

Proof. For every point p of diﬀerentiability for f , we have that Np(f ) is a similarity if and
only if LNp(f )(e) = ℓNp(f )(e), which by Corollary 3.6 is equivalent to ℓf (p) = Lf (p).
(cid:3)

Proposition 3.15. Let f : M → N be a quasiconformal map between sub-Riemannian man-
ifolds. At every point p ∈ M such that Lf (p) = ℓf (p) one has that H =
f (p) = 1. Hence,
Condition (1.8) implies Conditions (1.5).

CONFORMALITY IN SUB-RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS

23

Proof. Notice that at every point in which Lf (p) = ℓf (p) one has the existence of the limit

lim

d(p,q)=r→0

d(f (p), f (q))

r

.

Consequently, at those points one has

H =

(cid:3)

Therefore, we proved the equivalence of the metric deﬁnitions, i.e., Conditions (1.4), (1.5),

(1.7), (1.8), and (1.9).

3.4. Jacobians and Popp measure. Let (M, µM ) and (N, µN ) be metric measure spaces
and let f : M → N be a homeomorphism. We say that Jf : M → R is a Jacobian for f with
respect to the measures µM and µN , if f ∗µN = Jf µM , which is equivalent to the change of
variable formula:

(3.16)

Zf (A)

h d µN = ZA

(h ◦ f ) Jf d µM ,

for every A ⊂ M measurable and every continuous function h : N → R.

If M and N are equiregular sub-Riemannian manifolds of Hausdorﬀ dimension Q, we
consider µM and µN to be both either the Q-dimensional spherical Hausdorﬀ measures
or the Popp measures. See [Mon02, BR13] for the deﬁnition of the Popp measure and
Example 3.20 for the case of step-2 Carnot groups. In these cases, we denote the corre-
sponding Jacobians as JHaus
, respectively. If f is a quasiconformal map, such
Jacobians are uniquely determined up to sets of measure zero. In fact, by Theorem [HK98,
Theorem 4.9, Theorem 7.11] and [MM95, Theorem 7.1], they can be espressed as volume
derivatives. Moreover, by an elementary calculation using just the deﬁnition one checks
that the Jacobian satisﬁes the formula

and JPopp

f

f

(3.17)

Jf (p) = 1/ Jf −1(f (p)).

Remark 3.18. We have that if f : M → N is quasiconformal and at almost every point p its
diﬀerential Np(f ) is a similarity, then for almost every p ∈ M the Carnot groups Np(M ) and
Nf (p)(N ) are isometric. Indeed, if λp is the dilation factor of Np(f ), then the composition
of Np(f ) and the group dilation by λ−1
gives an isometry. As a consequence, Np(M ) and
p
Nf (p)(N ) are isomorphic as metric measure spaces when equipped with their Popp measures
volNp(M ) and volNf (p)(N ), respectively. In particular, for almost every p ∈ M , we have
(3.19)

volNp(M )(BNp(M )(e, 1)) = volNf (p)(N )(BNf (p)(N )(e, 1)).

Example 3.20. We recall in a simple case the construction of the Popp measure. Namely,
we consider a Carnot group of step 2, that is, the Lie algebra is stratiﬁed as V1 ⊕ V2. Let
B ⊆ V1 ⊆ TeG be the (horizontal) unit ball with respect to a sub-Riemannian metric tensor
g1 at the identity, which is the intersection of the metric unit ball at the identity with V1, in
exponential coordinates. The set [B, B] := {[X, Y ] : X, Y ∈ B} is the unit ball of a unique
2 deﬁnes the unique scalar product on
V1 ⊕V2 that make V1 and V2 orthogonal and extend g1 and g2. Extending the scalar product

scalar product g2 on V2. The formula g :=»g2

1 + g2

24

LUCA CAPOGNA, ENRICO LE DONNE, AND ALESSANDRO OTTAZZI

on TeG by left translation, one obtains a Riemannian metric tensor ˜g on the Lie group G.
For such a Carnot group the Popp measure is by deﬁnition the Riemannian volume measure
of ˜g.

Remark 3.21. In Carnot groups the Popp measure is strictly monotone as a function of the
distance, in the sense that if d and d′ are two distances on the same Carnot group such that
d′ ≤ d and d′ 6= d, then Poppd′ ≤ Poppd and Poppd′
6= Poppd. Indeed, this claim follows
easily from the construction of the measure. For simplicity of notation, we illustrate the
proof for Popp measures in Carnot groups of step 2 as we recalled in Example 3.20. If B′ is
a set that strictly contains B then clearly [B, B] ⊆ [B′, B′] and hence the unit ball for g is
strictly contained in the unit ball for g′. In other words, the vector space TeG is equipped
with two diﬀerent (Euclidean) distances, say ρ and ρ′, and by assumption, the identity
id : (TeG, ρ) → (TeG, ρ′) is 1-Lipschitz. Therefore, the Hausdorﬀ measure with respect to
ρ is greater than the one with respect to ρ′. At this point we recall that the Hausdorﬀ
measure of a Eulidean space equals the Lebesque measure with respect to orthonormal
coordinates. In other words, the Hausdorﬀ measure is equal to the measure induced by the
top-dimensional form that takes value 1 on any orthonormal basis, which is by deﬁnition
the Riemannian volume form. We therefore deduce that the Riemannian volume measure
of ˜g is less than the Riemannian volume measure of ˜g′. Hence, Poppd′ ≤ Poppd. Moreover,
the equality holds only if ˜g = ˜g′, which holds if and only if B′ = B.

Lemma 3.22. Let A : G → G′ be an isomophism of Carnot groups of Hausdorﬀ dimension
Q. If either JA(e) = (LA(e))Q or JA(e) = (ℓA(e))Q, then A is a similarity.

Proof. Up to composing A with a dilation, we assume that LA(e) = 1, i.e., A is 1-Lipschitz.
Then if JA(e) = (LA(e))Q we have that JA = 1, which means that the push forward
via A of the Popp measure on G is the Popp measure on G′. Moreover, identifying the
group structures via A, we assume that we are in the same group G (algebraically) that is
equipped with two diﬀerent Carnot distances d and d′ such that d′ ≤ d, since the identity
A = id : (G, d) → (G, d′) is 1-Lipschitz. If d′ 6= d, then by Remark 3.21 Poppd′
6= Poppd,
which contradicts the assumption. We conclude that d′ = d, i.e., A = id is an isometry.
The case when JA(e) = (ℓA(e))Q is similar.
(cid:3)

3.5. A remark on tangent volumes. We prove that the Jacobian of a quasiconformal
map coincides with the Jacobian of its tangent map almost everywhere. We begin by re-
calling the Margulis and Mostow’s convergence [MM95]. Fix a point p in a sub-Riemannian
manifold M and consider privileged coordinates centered at p, see [MM95, page 418]. Let g
be the sub-Riemannian metric tensor of M . Let δǫ be the dilations associated to the privi-
leged coordinates. Notice that (δǫ)∗g is isometric via δǫ to g and gǫ := 1
ǫ (δǫ)∗g is isometric
via δǫ to 1
ǫ g. A key fact is that gǫ converge to g0, as ǫ → 0, which is a sub-Riemannian
metric.
(This convergence is the convergence of some orthonormal frames uniformly on
compact sets).

Mitchell’s theorem [Mit85] can be restated as the fact that (Rn, g0) is the tangent Carnot
group Np(M ). Margulis and Mostow actually proved that the maps δ−1
◦ f ◦ δǫ converge
uniformly, as ǫ → 0, on compact sets to the map Np(f ). Moreover, by functoriality of the

ǫ

CONFORMALITY IN SUB-RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS

25

construction of the Popp measure, we have that volgǫ → volg0, in the sense that if ωǫ is the
smooth function such that volgǫ = ωǫL, then ωǫ → ω0 uniformly on compact sets.

Proposition 3.23. Let f : M → N be a quasiconformal map between equiregular sub-
Riemannian manifolds of Hausdorﬀ dimension Q. For almost every p ∈ M

Proof. Denote by Bgǫ

3.6. Equivalence of the analytic deﬁnition.

Lemma 3.26. Let f : M → N be a quasiconformal map between equiregular sub-Riemannian
manifolds of Hausdorﬀ dimension Q. If the diﬀerential Np(f ) of f is a similarity for almost
every p ∈ M , then

ℓf (p)Q = JPopp

f

(p) = Lf (p)Q,

for almost every p ∈ M.

Proof. Let p be a point where JPopp
all ǫ > 0, there exists ¯r > 0 such that, if q ∈ M is such that d(q, p) ∈ (0, ¯r), then

(p) is expressed as volume derivative. By deﬁnition, for

f

d(f (q), f (p))

d(p, q)

≤ Lf (p) + ǫ.

Hence for every r ∈ (0, ¯r),

So one has

f (B(p, r)) ⊂ B(f (p), r(Lf (p) + ǫ)).

volN (f (B(p, r)))

volM (B(p, r))

Letting r → 0, using (3.25) with q = p and q = f (p), and using (3.19), we have

JPopp
f

(p) ≤ (Lf (p) + ǫ)Q.

Notice that equation (3.19) requires the assumption of the diﬀerential being a similarity.
Since ǫ is arbitrary, JPopp
f −1 (f (p)) = 1 and
ℓf (p) · Lf −1(f (p)) = 1, the same argument applied to f −1 yields ℓf (p)Q ≤ JPopp
(p). With
Corollary 3.14 we conclude.
(cid:3)

(p) ≤ Lf (p)Q. Once we recall that JPopp

For an arbitrary quasiconformal map we expect the relation

ℓf (p)Q ≤ JPopp

to hold. However, our proof of Lemma 3.26 makes a crucial use of equation (3.19), which
is not true in general.

Lemma 3.27. Let f : M → N be a quasiconformal map between equiregular sub-Riemannian
manifolds of Hausdorﬀ dimension Q. If for almost every p ∈ M either

or

ℓf (p)Q = JPopp

then Np(f ) is a similarity, for almost every p.

Proof. In view of Proposition 3.23 and Corollary 3.6, we have either ℓNp(f )(e)Q = JNp(f )(e)
or JNp(f )(e) = LNp(f )(e). Therefore, by Lemma 3.22 we get that Np(f ) is a similarity. (cid:3)

3.7. Equivalence of geometric deﬁnitions. We recall the deﬁnition of the modulus of
a family Γ of curves in a metric measure space (M, vol). A Borel function ρ : M → [0, ∞]
is said to be admissible for Γ if for every rectiﬁable γ ∈ Γ,

(3.28)

The Q-modulus of Γ is

ρ ds ≥ 1.

Zγ
ρQ d vol : ρ is admissible for Γ™ .

ModQ(Γ) = infßZM

Proposition 3.29. Let f : M → N be a quasiconformal map between equiregular sub-
Riemannian manifolds of Hausdorﬀ dimension Q. Then ModQ(Γ) = ModQ(f (Γ)) for every
family Γ of curves in M if and only if LQ

f (p) = Jf (p) for a.e. p.

Proof. This equivalence is actually a very general fact after the work of Cheeger [Che99]
and Williams [Wil12]. Since locally sub-Riemannian manifolds are doubling metric spaces
that satisfy a Poincar´e inequality, we have that the pointwise Lipschitz constant Lf (·) is
the minimal upper gradient of the map f , see Proposition 3.10 and Lemma 3.5. We also
loc and hence in the Newtonian space N 1,Q
remark that any quasiconformal map is in W 1,Q
loc ,
see [BKR07]. By a result of Williams [Wil12, Theorem 1.1], Lf (p)Q ≤ Jf (p), for almost

CONFORMALITY IN SUB-RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS

27

every p, if and only if ModQ(Γ) ≤ ModQ(f (Γ)), for every family Γ of curves in M . Hence,
we get the inequality Lf (p)Q ≤ Jf (p).

Now consider the inverse map f −1. Such a map satisﬁes the same assumptions of f .
In particular, applying to f −1 William’s result, we have that ModQ(Γ) ≤ ModQ(f −1(Γ))
for every family Γ of curves in N if and only if Lf −1(q)Q ≤ Jf −1(q), for almost every
q ∈ N . Writing f −1(Γ) = Γ′ and q = f (p) and using (3.8) and (3.17), we conclude that
ModQ(f (Γ′)) ≤ ModQ(Γ′) for every family Γ′ of curves in M if and only if Jf (p) ≤ ℓQ
f (p) ≤
LQ
f (p), for almost every p ∈ M

(cid:3)

Let M be an equiregular sub-Riemannian manifold of Hausdorﬀ dimension Q. Let volM

be the Popp measure of M . For all u ∈ W 1,Q

H (M, volM ), the Q-energy of u is

EQ(u) := ZM

|∇Hu|Q d volM .

Remark 3.30. Since EQ(u) = IQ(u, u), if the operator IQ is preserved, then the Q-energy is
preserved. Namely, Condition (1.12) implies Condition (1.15).

Proposition 3.31. For a quasiconformal map f : M → N between equiregular sub-Riemannian
manifolds of Hausdorﬀ dimension Q, Condition (1.15) implies Condition (1.16).

Proof. Let E, F ⊂ M compact sets in M . We set S(E, F ) to denote the family of all
u ∈ W 1,Q
H (M ) such that u|E = 1, u|F = 0 and 0 ≤ u ≤ 1. Recall that the Q-capacity
CapQ(E, F ) is then deﬁned as the inﬁmum of the Q-energy EQ(u) among all competitors
u ∈ S(E, F ):

Since f satisﬁes (1.15), the map v 7→ v ◦f is a bijection between S(f (E), f (F )) and S(E, F )
that preserves the Q-energy. Correspondingly, one has that

CapQ(f (E), f (F )) = inf{EQ(v) : v ∈ S(f (E), f (F ))}

= inf{EQ(v ◦ f ) : v ∈ S(f (E), f (F ))}
= inf{EQ(u) : u ∈ S(E, F )}

Proposition 3.32. Let f : M → N be a quasiconformal map between equiregular sub-
Riemannian manifolds of Hausdorﬀ dimension Q. Either of Condition (1.6) and Con-
dition (1.10) implies Condition (1.12).

Proof. Let p be a point of diﬀerentiability of f . Given an orthonormal basis {Xj} of HpM ,
from (1.6) we have that vectors

Yj := Lf (p)−1(dH f )pXj

28

form an orthonormal basis of HqN , with q = f (p). Then, for every open subset V ⊂ N and
for every v ∈ W 1,Q

H (N ),

Xj(v ◦ f )p = dH(v ◦ f )p(Xj)

= (dH v)q(dH f )p(Xj)
= (dH v)q(Lf (p)Yj) = Lf (p)(Yju)q.

Therefore, for any v, φ ∈ W 1,Q

H (N ). Choose any smooth frame

for every i = 1, . . . , r. Then at least one of the ψi must be diﬀerent from zero in V . Without
loosing generality, say ψ1 6= 0 on V . By possibly taking V smaller, we may assume that
1. Substituting in

X1, . . . , Xr of HN , and write the left hand side of (3.35) as Pr
RV ψ1 d volN 6= 0. Let φ be the coordinate function x1, that is Xjφ = δj

the left hand side of (3.34), we conclude

ZV

h(ψ1, . . . , ψr), ∇Hφi d volN = ZV

ψ1 d volN 6= 0,

which contradicts (3.34). This completes the proof of (3.35).

Next, ﬁx q ∈ N a point of diﬀerentiability where (3.35) holds. For every vector ξ ∈ HqN ,
consider vξ such that (∇Hvξ)q = ξ. For every ξ ∈ HqN such that |ξ| = 1, the following
holds

Jf −1(q)|(dH f )T

q ξ|Q−2h(dH f )f −1(q)(dH f )T

q ξ, ξi = 1.

Using (3.17), the equality above becomes

|(dH f )T

q ξ|Q−2h(dH f )T

q ξ, (dH f )T

q ξi = Jf (f −1(q))

which is equivalent to

|(dH f )T

q ξ|Q = Jf (f −1(q))

for every ξ on HqN of norm equal to one. From (3.3) we have |(dH f )T
Therefore, at every point q ∈ N of diﬀerentiability,

q ξ(q)|Q = |Nq(f )T

∗ ξ(q)|Q.

kNf −1(q)(f )∗kQ = max{|Nq(f )T

∗ ξ|Q : ξ ∈ HqN, |ξ| = 1} = Jf (f −1(q)).

By Lemma 3.5 and writing p = f −1(q), we conclude Lf (p)Q = Jf (p) for almost every p ∈ M ,
establishing (1.10).

3.9. Equivalence of the two Jacobians. Given M an equiregular sub-Riemannian man-
ifold of Hausdorﬀ dimension Q, we prefer to work with the Popp measure volM rather than
the spherical Hausdorﬀ measure S Q

in which S Q

4. Coordinates in sub-Riemannian manifolds

Given any system of coordinates near a point of a sub-Riemannian manifolds, we will
identify special subsets of these coordinates, that we call horizontal. By adapting a method
of Liimatainen and Salo [LS14], we show that they can be constructed so that in addition
they are also either harmonic or Q-harmonic (the more general construction of p-harmonic
coordinates follows along the same lines, modifying appropriately the hypothesis). The
construction of Q-harmonic coordinates is based upon a very strong hypothesis, namely that
the sub-Riemannian structure supports regularity for Q-harmonic functions. In contrast,
the construction of horizontal harmonic coordinates rests on well known Schauder estimates.
The key point of this section, and one of the main contributions of this paper, is that we
can prove that the smoothness of maps that preserve in a weak sense the horizontal bundles
can be derived by the smoothness of the horizontal components alone.

2Here we need to invoke [MM95, Corollary 6.5] or [HK98]

4.1. Horizontal coordinates.
Deﬁnition 4.1. Let M be a sub-Riemannian manifold. Let x1, . . . , xn be a system of coor-
dinates on an open set U of M and let X1, . . . , Xr be a frame of the horizontal distribution
on U . We say that x1, . . . , xr are horizontal coordinates with respect to X1, . . . , Xr if the
matrix (Xixj)(p), with i, j = 1, . . . , r, is invertible, for every p ∈ U .
Remark 4.2. It is clear that any system of coordinates x1, . . . ., xn around a point p ∈ M
can be reordered so that the ﬁrst r components become a system of horizontal coordinates.

The next result states that the notion of horizontal coordinate does not depend on the

choice of frame.
Proposition 4.3. Assume that x1, . . . , xn are coordinates such that x1, . . . , xr are horizontal
with respect to the frame X1, . . . , Xr. Then

(i) ∇Hx1, . . . , ∇Hxr are linearly independent and form a frame of ∆.
(ii) If X′

r is another frame of ∆, then x1, . . . , xr are horizontal coordinates with
1, . . . , X′
r.

4.2. Horizontal harmonic coordinates. Let M be a sub-Riemannian manifold endowed
with a volume form vol. Our goal is to construct horizontal coordinates in the neighborhood
of any point p ∈ M , that are also in the kernel of the subLaplacian L2, deﬁned in (2.9),
associated to the sub-Riemannian structure and a volume form.

Theorem 4.4. Let M be an equiregular sub-Riemannian structure endowed with a smooth
volume form vol. For any point p ∈ M there exists a set of horizontal harmonic coordinates
deﬁned in a neighborhood of p.

To prove this result we start by considering any system of coordinates x1, . . . , xn in
a neighborhood of p ∈ M . Without loss of generality we can assume that the vectors
∇Hx1, . . . , ∇Hxr are linearly independent in a neighborhood of p, i.e., x1, .., xr are horizontal
coordinates. Set Bǫ := Bǫ(p) = {q ∈ M | d(p, q) < ǫ}. For ǫ > 0, let u1
ǫ be the
unique weak solution of the Dirichlet problem

the analogue interpolation lemma in [LS14].

Lemma 4.7. Let p ∈ K ⊂⊂ M and let h be a function deﬁned on Bǫ. If there are constants

(i) khk2

4.3. Horizontal Q-harmonic coordinates. Throughout this section we will assume that
M is an equivariant sub-Riemannian structure, endowed with a smooth volume form vol,
that supports regularity for Q-harmonic functions, in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.20.

We will need an interpolation lemma analogue to Lemma 4.7.

Lemma 4.8. Let p ∈ K ⊂⊂ M and let f be a function deﬁned on Bǫ. If there are constants
β, A, B > 0 and α ∈ (0, 1) such that for ǫ > 0 suﬃciently small one has

Theorem 4.9. Let M be an equiregular sub-Riemannian structure endowed with a smooth
volume form vol that supports regularity for Q-harmonic functions. For any point p ∈
M there exists a set of horizontal coordinates deﬁned in a neighborhood of p that are Q-
harmonic.

Proof. We follow the argument outlined in the special case of Theorem 4.4. For p ∈ K ⊂⊂
M and ǫ > 0 to be determined later, we consider weak solutions ui

In the following, we will consider maps that are absolutely continuous on curves (ACCQ).
We recall that such maps send almost every (with respect to the Q-modulus measure)
rectiﬁable curve into a rectiﬁable curve (see [Sha00] for more details).
In the case of a
sub-Riemannian manifold M , ACC maps deﬁned on M have the following property. Let
X be any horizontal vector ﬁeld in M and denote by φt
X the corresponding ﬂow. Then for
almost every p ∈ M (with respect to Lebesgue measure), one has that t → f (φt
X(p)) is a
rectiﬁable curve.

5. Regularity of 1-quasiconformal maps

In this section we prove Theorem 1.21. Let us ﬁrst clarify the deﬁnition of the function
spaces involved. Given two equiregular sub-Riemannian manifolds M, N , we say that a
homeomorphism f is in C 1,α
H,loc(M, N ) if, in any (smooth) coordinate system
of N , the components of f belong to C 1,α

H,loc(M ).

5.1. Every 1-quasiconformal map in C 1,α
H,loc(M, N ) is conformal. We
now show that, assuming that a 1-quasiconformal map has the basic regularity, then the
map is smooth. The proof is independent from the results in Section 4. Namely, we do not
need to assume any regularity theory for Q-Laplacian.

H,loc(M, N ) ∩ W 2,2

Proof of Theorem 1.21.(i). Denote by volM and volN the Popp measures of M and N . For
p ∈ M , consider any system of smooth coordinates y1, ..., yn in a neighborhood of f (p) ∈ N .

5.2. Regularity of Q-harmonic functions implies conformality. We now reduce the
smoothness assumption by using horizontal Q-harmonic coordinates, see Section 4. To
ensure their existence and to use them we need to assume that the manifolds support the
regularity theory for Q-Laplacian as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1.20.

Proof of Theorem 1.21.(ii). We shall use Proposition 4.14. Since sub-Riemannian manifolds
are Q-regular, by [HK98] any quasiconformal map is ACCQ (see also [MM95, Corollary 6.5])
In view of Theorem 4.9, consider u1, . . . , un a system of local coordinates around a point
f (p) ∈ M for which the horizontal coordinates u1, . . . , ur are Q-harmonic.

In view of the morphism property (Corollary 1.18) the pull-backs fi = ui ◦ f , for
i = 1, . . . , r are Q-harmonic functions in a neighborhood of p ∈ M . By the Q-harmonic
regularity assumption, both ui and f i = ui ◦ f are in C 1,α
H,loc(M ), for i = 1, . . . , r. Ap-
ply Proposition 4.14 to f with k = 1 and get f ∈ C 1,α
H,loc(M, N ). Since also f −1 is 1-
quasiconformal, the same argument shows that f −1 ∈ C 1,α
H,loc(N, M ). In particular, the map
f is bi-Lipschitz and f 1, . . . , f n is a local system of bi-Lipschitz coordinates. In particular,
|∇Hf 1|, . . . , |∇Hf n| are bounded away from zero. Because of the Q-regularity hypothesis,
we have that f 1, . . . , f r are in W 2,2
H,loc(M ). Invoking Proposition 4.14 once more, we have
that f 1, . . . , f n are in W 2,2
(cid:3)

H,loc(M ).

We remark that in the setting of Carnot groups both the existence of horizontal Q-
harmonic coordinates and the Lipschitz regularity of 1-quasiconformal can be proven di-
rectly without using any PDE argument, see [Pan89].

6. Liouville Theorem for contact sub-Riemannian manifolds

6.1. Q-Laplacian with respect to a divergence-free frame. In this section we intend
to write the Q-Laplacian in a sub-Riemannian manifold using a horizontal frame that is
not necessarily orthonormal, but is divergence-free with respect to some other volume form.
Recall that a vector ﬁeld X is divergence-free with respect to a volume form µ if its adjoint
with respect to µ equals −X.

Let M be a sub-Riemannian manifold equipped with a smooth volume form vol. Let
Y1, . . . , Yr be an orthonormal frame for the horizontal distribution HM of M . Recall from

Assume that there exists another frame X1, . . . , Xr of HM and another smooth volume
form µ such that each Xi is divergence-free with respect to µ. If g is the sub-Riemannian
metric of M , let

gij := g(Xi, Xj ) ∈ C ∞(M ).

For all x ∈ M , let gij(x) be the inverse matrix of gij(x) and deﬁne the family of scalar
products on Rr as

˜gx(v, w) := vigij(x)wj,

x ∈ M, v, w ∈ Rr.

Then there exists aj

Using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the equivalence of norms in Rr, and the smoothness of

compact set of M , for some λ, Λ > 0 depending only on Q, and for every χ ∈ Rr,

Summarizing, we have the following.

Proposition 6.6. Let M be a sub-Riemannian manifold and consider vol and µ two smooth
volume forms on M . Assume there is a horizontal frame X1, . . . , Xr on M of vector ﬁelds
that are divergence-free with respect to µ. If u is a function on M that is Q-harmonic with
respect to vol, then u satisﬁes

Remark 6.7. In the above we used two diﬀerent structures of metric measure space on
the same manifold M . These are (M, g, vol) and (M, g0, µ), where g0 is the metric for
which X1, . . . , Xm form an orthonormal frame. For each of these structures we may deﬁne
corresponding Sobolev spaces W p,q
H (M, g0, µ). Similarly, we consider
spaces C 1,α

6.2. Darboux coordinates on contact manifolds. On every contact manifold, the exis-
tence of a frame of divergence-free vector ﬁelds with respect to some measure is ensured by
Darboux Theorem. More generally, every sub-Riemannian manifold that is contactomorphic
to a unimodular (e.g., nilpotent) Lie group equipped with a horizontal left-invariant distri-
bution admits such a frame. The reason is that left-invariant vector ﬁelds are divergence-free
with respect to the Haar measure of the group. We shall recall now Darboux Theorem and
we recall the standard contact structures, which are those of the Heisenberg groups.

Darboux Theorem states, see [Etn03], that every two contact manifolds of the same
dimension are locally contactomorphic. In particular, any contact 2n + 1-manifold is locally
contactomorphic to the standard contact structure on R2n+1, a frame of which is given by

(6.8)

∂x2n+1,

where i = 1, . . . , n. For future reference we will also set X2n+1 = ∂x2n+1. This frame is
left-invariant for a speciﬁc Lie group structure, which we denote by Hn: the Heisenberg
group.

Corollary 6.9. (of Darboux Theorem) Let M be a contact sub-Riemannian 2n + 1-manifold
equipped with a volume form vol. There are local coordinates x1, . . . , x2n+1 in which the
horizontal distribution is given by the vector ﬁelds in (6.8), which are divergence-free with
respect to the Lebesgue measure L, and there exists ω ∈ C ∞ such that ω−1 ∈ C ∞ and
d vol = ω d L.

6.3. Riemannian approximations. Let us consider a contact 2n + 1 manifold M , with
subRiemannian metric g0 and volume form vol. Let Y1, ..., Y2n denote a g0-orthonormal
horizontal frame in a neighborhood Ω ⊂ M , and denote by Y2n+1 the Reeb vector ﬁeld. For
every ǫ ∈ (0, 1) we may deﬁne a 1-parameter family of Riemannian metrics gǫ on M so that
the frame Y1, ..., Y2n, ǫY2n+1 is orthonormal. Denote by Y ǫ
2n+1 such gǫ-orthonormal

ity for Q-harmonic functions. Hence, together with Theorem 1.21, this result will yield
Theorem 1.19.

Theorem 6.15. The following two properties hold:

(1) For every open U ⊂⊂ Ω and for every ℓ > 0, there exist constants α ∈ (0, 1), C > 0
H (U ) < ℓ,

CONFORMALITY IN SUB-RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS

This result is due to Zhong [Zho10], in the case when g0 is a left invariant subRieman-
nian metric in Hn. The proof in [Zho10] breaks down with the additional dependence on
x, in the coeﬃcients of the equation as expressed in Proposition 6.6.
In fact, in one of
the approximations used in [Zho10], the argument relies on the existence of explicit bar-
rier functions, which one does not have in our setting. To deal with this issue we follow
the method recently used in [CCGM16] where a Riemannian approximation scheme was
employed to carry out the corresponding regularization for evoluationary equations. Apart
from this aspect the arguments in [Zho10] apply to the present setting as well. Note that
the H¨older regularity of the solution u is considerably simpler (see for instance [CDG93]).

Remark 6.16. The proof in [Zho10] applies to any Carnot group of step two, and likewise
the conclusion of Theorem 6.15 continues to hold in this more general setting.

Qu = 0 in Ω ⊂ Hn. For ǫ > 0 we consider W k,p

Riemannian approximation. Throughout the rest of the section we will assume δ > 0 and
let u denote a solution of L0
to be
the Sobolev and H¨older spaces corresponding to the frame X ǫ
2n+1. Observe that by
virtue of classical elliptic theory (see for instance [LU68] ) for δ > 0 one has that the weak
solutions uǫ ∈ W 1,Q
ǫ,loc(Ω) of (6.11) are in fact smooth in Ω. For a ﬁxed ball D ⊂⊂ Ω and
for any ǫ ≥ 0, standard PDE arguments (see for instance [HKM06]) yield the existence and
unicity of the solution to the Dirichlet problem

(Lǫ,δ

Q uǫ = 0 in D
uǫ − u ∈ W 1,Q

ǫ,0 (D).

Although the smoothness of uǫ may degenerate as ǫ → 0 and δ → 0, we will show that
the estimates on the H¨older norm of the gradient do not depend on these parameters and
hence will hold uniformly in the limit. Note that in view of the Caccioppoli inequality and
of the uniform bounds on the H¨older norm of uǫ as ǫ → 0 (such bounds depend only on
the stability of the Poincar´e inequality and on the doubling constants of the Riemannian
Heisenberg groups (Hn, gǫ) which are stable in view of [CCR13]), one has that for any
K ⊂⊂ D there exists a constant MK,Q > 0 depending only on Q, K such that

||∇ǫuǫ||LQ(K) ≤ MK,Q.

The next proposition addresses the non trivial uniform bounds.

Proposition 6.18. The following two properties hold:

(1) For every open U ⊂⊂ D and for every ℓ > 0, there exist constants α ∈ (0, 1), C > 0
H (D) <

ǫ,loc(D)∩C ∞(D) is the unique solution of (6.17) with ||u||W 1,Q

such that if uǫ ∈ W 1,Q

ǫ

(U ) ≤ C,

∀ǫ > 0.

(2) For every open U ⊂⊂ D and for every ℓ, ℓ′ > 0, there exists a constant C > 0 such
H (D) < ℓ,

ǫ,loc(D)∩C ∞(D) is the unique solution of (6.17) with ||u||W 1,Q

that if uǫ ∈ W 1,Q
and 1

ℓ′ < |∇ǫuǫ| < ℓ′ on U , then one has
(U ) ≤ C,

||uǫ||W 2,2

∀ǫ > 0.

The main regularity result Theorem 6.15 then follows from Proposition 6.18, by means

of Ascoli-Arzela theorem and the uniqueness of the Dirichlet problem (6.17) when ǫ = 0.

The proof of Proposition 6.18 follows very closely the arguments in [Zho10]. For the
reader’s convenience we reproduce them in the two sections below. For the sake of notation’s
simplicity, and without any loss of generality, we will just present the proof in the case n = 1.

Uniform Lipschitz regularity. The aim of this section is to establish Lipschitz estimates that
are uniform as ǫ → 0, on a open ball B ⊂⊂ D.

Theorem 6.19. Let uǫ ∈ W 1,Q
D then there exists C > 0, depending only on Q, Λ, λ of (6.13) and (6.14), such that

Remark 6.23. Note that the terms containing X3 in the equations above are not bounded
as ǫ → 0 in the gǫ metric. In the following it will be crucial to obtain estimates that are
stable as ǫ → 0.

The following results were originally proved for the case with no dependence of x, in
[MM07, Theorem 7], [MZGZ09, Lemma 5.1] and then again in [Zho10] with a more direct
argument bypassing the diﬀerence quotients method. The proofs in our setting are very
similar and we omit most of the details.

Since we can choose |B| < 1, we can bring the ﬁrst term on the left hand side of (6.37) to
conclude the proof of the lemma.
(cid:3)

The proof of Theorem 6.19 now follows in a standard fashion, as described in [Zho10],
from the Moser iteration scheme (see for instance [GT01, Theorem 8.18]) and from [HKM06,
Lemma 3.38]. Note that the constant involved in such iteration are stable as ǫ → 0 (see
[CCR13]).

regularity. Throughout this section we will implicitly use the uniform (in ǫ)
local Lipschitz regularity of solutions of (6.17) and set for every B(x0, 2r0) ⊂ B, k ∈ R,
l = 1, 2, 3, and 0 < r < r0/4 < 1,

and A+

l,k,r = {x ∈ B(x0, r) such that X ǫ

l uǫ > k}.

The proof of Proposition 6.18 and in particular of the C 1,α estimate in part (1) follows

immediately from the following theorem, which is the main result of the section:

Theorem 6.38. Let uǫ ∈ W 1,Q
a constant s > 0 depending only on Q, λ, Λ, r0 such that

ǫ,loc(B) ∩ C ∞(B) be the unique solution of (6.17). There exists

Our ﬁrst step in the proof of this theorem consists in establishing a Caccioppoli inequality,
in Proposition 6.46 for second order derivatives on super level sets A+
l,k,r. This result will
imply that the gradient ∇ǫuǫ is in a De Giorgi-type class and then Theorem 6.38 will follow
from well known results in the literature.

We begin with some preliminary lemmata. We indicate by |A| the Lebesque measure

L(A) of a set A.

Lemma 6.39. Let uǫ ∈ W 1,Q
constant C > 0 depending only on Q, λ, Λ such that

ǫ,loc(B) ∩ C ∞(B) be the unique solution of (6.17). There exists a

only on q, λ, Λ such that for all k ∈ R, l = 1, 2, 3 and 0 < r′ < r < r0/2 one has

The term I3 is initially estimated through (6.40). This latter estimate, together with the

previous estimates on I1, I2, I4 leads to a weaker estimate than our goal (6.47), i.e.,

A similar argument yields the corresponding result for sub-level sets:

Corollary 6.49. Let uǫ ∈ W 1,Q
ǫ,loc(B) ∩ C ∞(B) be the unique solution of (6.17). For any
q ≥ 4 there exists a positive constant C depending only on q, λ, Λ such that for all k ∈ R,

where we have set ωl = (X ǫ

l uǫ − k)−.

From this point on, the rest of the argument does not rely on the function uǫ being
a solution of the equation anymore but only on the Caccioppoli inequality above. The
proof of Theorem 6.38 is very similar to the Euclidean case as developed in [LU68], and
[DiB83]. It ultimately relies on the properties of De Giorgi classes in the general setting
of metric spaces, as developed in [KS01] and [KMMP12]. We recall that a function f ∈
W 1,2
H (B(x0, r0)∩L∞(B(x0, r0) is in the De Giorgi class DG+(χ, q, γ) if there exists constants
χ, q, γ > 0 such that for every 0 < r′ < r < r0/4 < 1/2 and k ∈ R one has
(6.51)

ZB(x0,r′)

|∇ǫw|2 d L ≤ γ(r − r′)−2ZB(x0,r)

w2 d L + χ|{x ∈ B(x0, r) such that w > 0}|1− 2
q ,

where ω = (f − k)+. A function f ∈ W 1,2
H (B(x0, r0) ∩ L∞(B(x0, r0) is in the De Giorgi
class DG−(χ, q, γ) if (6.51) holds for ω = (f − k)−. We set DG(χ, q, γ) = DG+(χ, q, γ) ∩
DG−(χ, q, γ).
It is well known, see for instance [KMMP12] and references therein, that
functions in DG satisfy a scale invariant Harnack inequality and the following oscillation
bounds: If f ∈ DG(χ, q, γ) then there exists s = s(q, γ, Q, r0) > 0 such that

oscB(x0,r/2)f ≤ (1 − 2−s)oscB(x0,r)f + χr1− Q
q .

From the latter, the H¨older continuity follows immediately assuming q is large enough. We
need to show that (6.47) and (6.50) imply X ǫ
l uǫ ∈ DG(χ, q, γ). To do this we need to prove
a result analogue to [DiB83, Proposition 4.1]:

Lemma 6.52. In the notation established above, there exists τ > 0 depending on Q, λ, Λ, r0
such that if for at least one k = 1, 2, 3,

then

|®x ∈ B(x, r) such that X ǫ

kuǫ < 1

X ǫ

kuǫ ≥

sup
B(x, r
2 )

oscB(x,2r)|∇ǫuǫ|

.

Analogously, if for at least one k = 1, 2, 3,

then

|®x ∈ B(x, r) such that X ǫ

kuǫ > −

oscB(x,2r)|∇ǫuǫ|´| ≤ τ rQ,

CONFORMALITY IN SUB-RIEMANNIAN MANIFOLDS

This result is proved exactly as in [DiB83, Proposition 4.1] (see also [Zho10, Lemma 4.4])

and it yields essentially the equivalence

(δ + µ(2r)2)

Q−2

2 ≈ (δ + |∇ǫuǫ|2)

Q−2

,

for all x ∈ B(x0, r), when |∇ǫuǫ| is small with respect to oscB(x,2r)|∇ǫuǫ|. This equivalence,
together with (6.47) and (6.50) implies X ǫ
l uǫ ∈ DG(χ, q, γ), thus concluding the proof of
the H¨older regularity of the gradient in Theorem 6.38.
