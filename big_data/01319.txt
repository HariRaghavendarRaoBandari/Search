Background: The study of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) and the behavior of nuclear matter under extreme
conditions is crucial to our understanding of many nuclear and astrophysical phenomena. Nuclear reactions serve
as one of the means for studying the EOS.

Purpose: It is the aim of this paper to discuss the impact of nuclear fusion on the EOS. This is a timely subject
given the expected availability of increasingly exotic beams at rare isotope facilities [1]. In practice, we focus on
48Ca+48Ca fusion.
Method: We employ three diﬀerent approaches to calculate fusion cross-sections for a set of energy density
functionals with systematically varying nuclear matter properties. Fusion calculations are performed using frozen
densities, using a dynamic microscopic method based on density-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock (DC-
TDHF) approach, as well as direct TDHF study of above barrier cross-sections. For these studies, we employ a
family of Skyrme parametrizations with systematically varied nuclear matter properties.

Results: The folding-potential model provides a reasonable ﬁrst estimate of cross sections. DC-TDHF which
includes dynamical polarization reduces the fusion barriers and delivers much better cross sections. Full TDHF
near the barrier agreee nicely with DC-TDHF. Most of the Skyrme forces which we used deliver, on the average,
fusion cross sections in good agreement with the data. Trying to read oﬀ a trend in the results, we ﬁnd a slight
preference for forces which deliver a slope of symmetry energy of L ≈ 50 MeV that corresponds to a neutron-skin
thickness of 48Ca of Rskin = (0.180−0.210) fm.
Conclusions: Fusion reactions in the barrier and sub-barrier region can be a tool to study the EOS and the
neutron skin of nuclei. The success of the approach will depend on reduced experimental uncertainties of fusion
data as well as the development of fusion theories that closely couple to the microscopic structure and dynamics.

INTRODUCTION

Nuclear saturation—the existence of an equilibrium
The
density—is a hallmark of nuclear dynamics.
semi-empirical nuclear mass
formula of Bethe and
Weizs¨acker [2, 3] regards the atomic nucleus as an incom-
pressible liquid drop consisting of two quantum ﬂuids:
one electrically charged consisting of Z protons and one
electrically neutral containing N neutrons. The nearly
uniform density found in the interior of heavy nuclei and
the resulting A1/3 scaling of the nuclear size with mass
number A = Z+N feature among the most successful pre-
dictions of the liquid drop model. However, in reality the
liquid drop is not incompressible. Thus, it is pertinent to
ask how does the liquid-drop energy increase as the den-
sity departs from its equilibrium value [4]. Besides being
a fundamental nuclear-structure question, the answer to

this inquiry is also vital to our understanding of the nu-
clear equation of state (EOS). The EOS plays a key role
in elucidating the structure of exotic nuclei [5], the dy-
namics of heavy ion collisions [6, 7], the composition of
neutron stars [8–11], and the mechanism of core-collapse
supernovae [12–14]. As such, the EOS provides a power-
ful bridge between nuclear physics and astrophysics.

The quest for the nuclear EOS also generates a strong
and healthy interplay between theoretical, experimental,
and observational research [15]. New measurements drive
new theoretical eﬀorts, that in turn uncover new puzzles
that trigger even newer experiments and observations. It
is the aim of this paper to discuss the impact of nuclear
fusion on the EOS. This is a timely subject given the
expected availability of increasingly exotic beams at rare
isotope facilities [1]. This new frontier will enable reac-
tions of exotic beams with large neutron excess [16] that
will provide critical new information on the poorly-known
isospin dependence of the EOS [17, 18]. The isospin de-
pendence of the EOS is encoded in the symmetry en-
ergy which, in turn, quantiﬁes the energy cost of turning
symmetric nuclear matter into pure neutron matter. The
density dependence of the symmetry energy has become
an active and vibrant area of research as evinced by the

recent topical issue devoted exclusively to this topic [19].
A physical observable that is particularly sensitive to
the density dependence of the symmetry energy is the
neutron-skin thickness of 208Pb [20–23]; the neutron skin
is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the root-mean-square
radii of the neutron distribution (Rn) relative to that of
the proton (Rp). Whereas elastic electron scattering ex-
periments have provided a very detailed map of the pro-
ton distribution throughout the full nuclear chart [24–26],
a determination of the neutron density has tradition-
ally relied on hadronic experiments that are hindered
by large and uncontrolled uncertainties. However, us-
ing parity-violating electron scattering—a purely elec-
troweak reaction—the Lead Radius EXperiment (PREX)
has provided the ﬁrst clear evidence in favor of a neutron-
rich skin in 208Pb [27, 28]. Given that the weak charge of
the neutron is much larger than the corresponding weak
charge of the proton, parity-violating electron scatter-
ing provides an ideal tool to map the neutron distribu-
tion [29]. Since the proton radius of 208Pb is accurately
known [26], the determination of the neutron radius by
the PREX collaboration has eﬀectively determined the
neutron-skin thickness of 208Pb to be [27]:

R208

skin = R208

n −R208

p = 0.33+0.16−0.18 fm.

(1)

Note that experimental error will be reduced by a factor
of three (to ±0.06fm) in an already approved experiment
“PREX-II” [30].

An accurate measurement of R208

skin will signiﬁcantly
constrain the slope of the symmetry energy L, a fun-
damental parameter of the EOS that is very closely re-
lated to the pressure of pure neutron matter at satura-
tion density. The strong correlation between R208
skin and
L [23, 31] emerges from a simple question: where do the
excess neutrons go? Placing the 44 extra neutrons in
the core is favored by surface tension but disfavored by
the symmetry energy, which is larger at the center than
at the surface. Conversely, moving the excess neutrons
to the dilute surface increases the surface tension but re-
duces the symmetry energy. In this way, the neutron-skin
thickness of R208
skin develops from a dynamic competition
between the surface tension and L, which represents the
diﬀerence between the symmetry energy at saturation
density and at a lower surface density [18]. In particular,
for a “stiﬀ” symmetry energy, namely one that increases
rapidly with density, it is energetically advantageous to
move most the excess neutrons to the surface where the
symmetry energy is low; this generates a thick neutron
skin.

Besides PREX-II, the Calcium Radius EXperiment
(CREX) has been already approved to measure the weak
form factor of 48Ca at the Jeﬀerson Laboratory via
parity-violating electron scattering [32]. This purely elec-
troweak measurement will be carried out a momentum
transfer of q (cid:39) 0.8 fm
−1 that will allow the extraction of
the neutron radius of 48Ca with a precision of 0.02 fm.
The advantages of such an experiment are many. First,
it provides a theoretical bridge between ab-initio calcu-

2

lations that are now possible in the case of 48Ca [33] and
density functional theory which is at present the optimal
(and perhaps unique) theoretical tool to describe nuclei
Indeed, the strong correla-

tion observed between R208
skin and L while likely robust,
has been discussed exclusively in the context of density
functional theory. Second, a precise measurement of the
weak form factor of a medium-mass nucleus such as 48Ca
can be carried out at larger momentum transfer where
the parity-violating asymmetry is larger. Indeed, the sit-
uation in 48Ca is so favorable that the full weak-charge
form factor could be measured using parity-violating elec-
tron scattering [34]. Together then, PREX-II and CREX
provide a powerful complementary set of inputs to nu-
clear theory. CREX will allow ab-initio models of nu-
clear structure to be tested which, in turn, will inform
density functional theory. These improved energy den-
sity functionals may then be used with conﬁdence to in-
terpret the PREX-II measurement and ultimately place
stringent constraints on the density dependence of the
symmetry energy.

Most studies of the EOS involve inﬁnite or semi-
inﬁnite nuclear matter and examine the dependence of
the EOS on the underlying parametrization of the en-
ergy density functional (EDF) as well as its relation
to the macroscopic and macroscopic-microscopic mod-
els of nuclear matter [5, 35, 36]. The basic predictions
of all models can be characterized by a small number
of nuclear matter properties (NMP) commonly deﬁned
at the equilibrium state of symmetric matter. Those
NMP may be constrained by the rich spectrum of nu-
clear collective excitations of diverse spin-isospin char-
acter [37]. Among the more prominent ones are the
isoscalar giant monopole resonance, [38], the isoscalar
giant quadrupole resonance [39], and the isovector gi-
ant dipole resonance [40]. Lately, the electric dipole
polarizability—which is proportional to the inverse en-
ergy weighted sum of the isovector dipole response—
has received considerable attention because of its strong
connection to the density dependence of the symmetry
energy [41–47]. Time dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF)
theory in the small amplitude limit and equivalently the
random-phase-approximation (RPA) approaches provide
the means for a consistent calculation of these collective
excitations [4, 48–58].

Complementing these small-density collective excita-
tions are the large amplitude modes associated with
fusion and ﬁssion, which provide a challenging testing
ground for theoretical models against a vast amount of
existing experimental information. For its relevance to
CREX, in this paper we limit our study to 48Ca+48Ca
fusion. The main goal of such a study is to explore the
sensitivity of the fusion cross section to the EOS, partic-
ularly to the slope of the symmetry energy which has a
strong impact on the thickness of the neutron-rich skin
of 48Ca. Although theoretical models of nuclear fusion
may be hindered by hadronic uncertainties, sub-barrier
fusion is attractive because of the exponential character

of quantum-mechanical tunneling. Indeed, we conjecture
that sub-barrier fusion should be signiﬁcantly enhanced
for those models that predict a stiﬀ symmetry energy and
consequently a large neutron-skin thickness in 48Ca. To
test this conjecture and to explore the sensitivity of the
fusion cross section to the EOS we use a series of Skyrme
EDFs with systematically varied NMP [59]. We note in
passing the close connection between the fusion of two
neutron-rich nuclei and the merger of two neutron stars.
Indeed, the late inspiral phase of neutron-star mergers
probes the nuclear EOS through the tidal deformation
of the star which is highly sensitive to the stellar radius.
Both the thickness of the neutron skin and the radius
of a neutron star have the same origin: the pressure of
neutron-rich matter. Hence, models with thicker neutron
skins often produce neutron stars with larger radii [60–
62]. This interesting correlations provides a compelling
connection between nuclear physics and astrophysics.

The paper has been organized as follows.

In Sec. II
we discuss the general features of the parametrization
of the EOS, with a more detailed discussion left to Ap-
pendix A. This is followed in Sec. III A by the calcula-
tion of fusion barriers using the double-folding potential
approach to examine the impact of NMP on fusion cross-
sections using a purely static approach. The impact of
the dynamics is studied utilizing the density constrained
TDHF and direct TDHF calculations in Secs. III B and
III C, respectively. A summary of our main ﬁndings and
some concluding remarks are given in Sec. IV.

II. ENERGY DENSITY FUNCTIONALS

Despite signiﬁcant progress in nuclear ab-initio calcu-
lations (for reviews see e.g. Refs. [63–67]), the predic-
tions are not yet sophisticated enough to serve as the
basis for high-precision functionals, especially in the case
of medium to heavy nuclei. Consequently, most nuclear
EDFs are calibrated to experimental data. The limited
availability of discerning data—especially in the case of
the isovector sector—as well as approximations and the-
oretical biases leads to residual uncertainties in the ﬁtted
parametrizations and these propagate to uncertainties in
the model predictions; for extensive discussions of error
propagation and error estimates see, e.g., Refs. [4, 5, 68–
72]).
It is our aim here to explore the sensitivity and
variance of model predictions for fusion cross sections.

From the great variety of nuclear EDFs, we concentrate
here on the widely used Skyrme EDFs as a prototype ex-
ample. The Skyrme force as an eﬀective nuclear interac-
tion dates back to the original work of Skyrme [73] which
was then utilized in a quantitative manner in the pio-
neering paper of Vautherin [74]. The Skyrme interaction
was subsequently developed as to provide an accurate de-
scription of nuclear structure and dynamics across the full
chart of the nuclides [75]. For the purpose of the present
study, we focus on the series of Skyrme parametrizations
with systematically varied NMP developed in Ref. [59].

3

The critical point exploited here is that there is a one-to-
one correspondence between NMP and the volume prop-
erties of the Skyrme EDF. This allows the use of NMP to
conveniently characterize each EDF. The calibration of
the EDF results in predictions that determine the NMP
with some uncertainty. The systematic variation of the
NMP is done within this uncertainty band. Tracking the
trends of an observable along such systemically varied
parametrizations results in an uncertainty in the predic-
tion. In turn, such an uncertainty in the prediction dic-
tates the experimental precision that would be needed to
better constrain the underlying EDF.

A detailed description of the Skyrme EDF and its re-
lation to NMP may be found in Appendix A. Here, we
limit ourselves to summarize the strategy involved in
generated systematically varied parametrizations. In all
cases, Skyrme EDFs are ﬁtted to the same pool of bulk
properties of the nuclear ground state, namely, bind-
ing energies, pairing gaps from odd-even staggering, a
few selected spin-orbit splittings, and bulk properties of
the nuclear charge distribution, such as the root-mean-
square radius, diﬀraction radius, and surface thickness;
for more details see [59].
In addition, the ﬁts are fur-
ther constrained by four nuclear matter parameters: (a)
the incompressibility K of symmetric nuclear matter, (b)
the isoscalar eﬀective mass m∗/m, (c) the symmetry en-
ergy at saturation J, and (d) the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn
sum rule enhancement factor κTRK (for more details see
Appendix A). The base parametrization is SV-bas with
K = 234 MeV, m∗/m = 0.9, J = 30 MeV, and κTRK = 0.4.
These NMP are chosen such that the underlying SV-bas
parametrization provides a good description of various
giant resonances and the electric dipole polarizability in
208Pb. Subsequently, we systematically vary each nu-
clear matter property by holding all others ﬁxed at their
optimal value. Varying K yields SV-K218, SV-K226,
and SV-K241, where the corresponding label indicates
the adopted value of K.
In a similar manner, varying
m∗/m yields SV-mas10, SV-mas08, and SV-mas07, cor-
responding to values of the isoscalar eﬀective mass of
m∗/m = 1.0, 0.8, and 0.7, respectively. Fixing the sym-
metry energy at saturation density to J = 28, 32, 34 MeV
yields SV-sym28, SV-sym32, and SV-sym34. Finally,
varying κTRK yields SV-kap00, SV-kap20, and SV-kap60,
corresponding to values of 0.00, 0.20, and 0.60, respec-
tively. For further details on the predictions of these
parametrizations, including the highly uncertain slope of
the symmetry energy L, see Table II in Appendix A.

In order to have a better handle on the variation of
the neutron skin as a function of the symmetry-energy
slope L and its impact on the fusion cross section, we
have produced four new forces with dedicated variation
of L. To that end, we keep the four NMP ﬁxed as in
SV-bas and in addition we set a constraint on L. This
constraint is then varied at the unconstrained value of L
in a range that still produces reasonable ﬁts. These new
forces, labeled “SV-L”, are also tabulated in Table II.

In the next section we investigate the trends that

emerge in the fusion barriers and cross sections for the
48Ca+48Ca reaction as we systematically vary the model
predictions. Given that we expect that the neutron dis-
tribution is the most critical piece determining the nu-
clear attraction at larger distances, we hope to gain valu-
able insights into the density dependence of the symme-
try energy. In Fig. 1 we show the emerging trends in neu-
tron radii and halo of 48Ca obtained from the series of
systematically varied EDFs. As expected, the symmetry
energy J has by far the strongest impact on the neutron
distribution. In contrast, there is some mild sensitivity
of the neutron distribution to the isoscalar eﬀective mass
m∗/m and even less to the incompressibility K, and neg-
ligble to the sum rule enhancment κTRK.

III. FUSION AND NMP

The use of fusion data to elucidate the dependence of
cross-sections on NMP requires a deep understanding of
the fusion process and its model dependence. Naturally,
reducing the highly complex fusion process to the estima-

tion of barrier(s) as a function of the distance between
the two nuclei R is a severe simplifying approximation.
In order to proceed in this manner, it is critical to test
this approximation on various energy regimes, as a func-
tion of the properties of the participating nuclei, and on
its sensitivity to the microscopic model parameters. For
example, in the case of 48Ca one avoids complexities as-
sociated with deformation [76] because of the spherical
character of this nucleus. The height of the ion-ion in-
teraction barrier is largely determined by the size of the
colliding nuclei and their nuclear skin. As the two nuclear
surfaces come within the range of the short-range nuclear
interaction, the barrier starts to deviate from its purely
Coulombic form as a result of the nuclear attraction. In
this early stage of the reaction, nuclei gradually devel-
oped a so-called “neck”, which subsequently evolves into
a compound system as the overlapping densities coalesce.
For light and mid-mass systems the barrier is found to be
largely insensitive to the beam energy [77]. At energies at
and above the barrier, the fusion cross-section displays its
highest sensitivity to the neutron-skin thickness, which
largely determines the height of the barrier. However,

rearrangements are expected to be sensitive to the other
NMP, such as the incompressibility coeﬃcient and the
symmetry energy. The 48Ca+48Ca system shows strong
fusion hindrance at deep sub-barrier energies [78]. So-
phisticated coupled-channel calculations using the shal-
low or compression potential approach have been done for
this system [79]. These calculations are consistent with a
neutron-skin thickness in 48Ca of 0.229 fm based on cho-
sen experimental estimates [26, 80]. Note, that this value
is signiﬁcantly larger than the Rskin (cid:46) 0.15 fm estimate
reported recently by Hagen and collaborators using an
ab-initio approach [33]. Some of the discrepancy may be
due to the fact that the neutron radius of 48Ca quoted
in Ref. [80] relies on experiments using elastic proton
scattering that are hindered by large and uncontrolled
hadronic uncertainties. Fortunately, this situation will
improve greatly by a purely electroweak determination
of the neutron radius of 48Ca by the CREX collabora-
tion [32]. At this point in our analysis it is not possible
to make a robust connection of these results with the
EOS and NMP. In addition, the use of frozen densities
in calculating the interacting potential is expected to re-
quire a slightly larger radius since the early stages of the
skin-skin attraction and stretching will occur at a some-
what smaller distance due to the inability of the densities
to dynamically stretch.

In this section we employ three diﬀerent methods to
study the dependence of the fusion cross section on the
various parametrizations of the Skyrme energy density
functional. First, we use the standard double-folding ap-
proach to calculate ion-ion potentials using frozen den-
sities. Second, we utilize the density-constrained time-
dependent Hartree-Fock (DC-TDHF) approach to calcu-
late the ion-ion potentials directly from TDHF densities.
Finally, we perform direct TDHF calculations at above
barrier energies to compute the fusion cross sections. In
what follows we brieﬂy outline each method and present
the associated results.

A. Double-folding potentials

In the double-folding approach the nuclear part of the
ion-ion interaction potential is approximated by the so-
called double folding potential VF (R):

(cid:90)

VF (R) =

d3r1d3r2ρ1(r1)ρ2(r2)VN N (R+r2−r1) , (2)

where ρ1(r1) and ρ2(r2) are the densities of the two nu-
clei as measured from their respective center of mass and
VN N is the eﬀective N N interaction.
In practice, we
have used self-consistent Hartree-Fock (HF) densities ob-
tained using a spherical Hartree-Fock code and the M3Y
eﬀective NN interaction [81–84]. The spherical HF code
uses a grid spacing of dr = 0.3 fm and maximum radial
distance of Rmax = 10.5 fm, which are more than ade-
quate to describe the ground-state density of 48Ca. The

5

double-folding integral is evaluated for the nuclear po-
tential together with the Coulomb integral in momen-
tum space [84]. The double-folding potential is expected
to be most reliable for distances where the nuclei begin
to touch and, thus, particularly sensitive to the neutron-
skin thickness of the colliding ions. At smaller distances,
the double-folding potential tends to overestimate the nu-
clear interaction as a result of the unphysically large over-
lap density due to the frozen-density approximation.

tentials, VF (R), for 48Ca+48Ca system using the Skyrme SV
EDFs; (a) potentials for SV-mas07, SV-mas08, SV-mas10,

is the folding potential corresponding to SV-bas. (b) poten-
tials for SV-K218, SV-K226, SV-K241, SV-kap00, SV-kap20,
and SV-kap60.

In Fig. 2 we show the ion-ion interaction potentials
deﬁned in Eq. 2 for the 48Ca+48Ca system using ground-
state densities computed for the set of SV forces de-
ﬁned in Sec.II. In particular, Fig. 2(a) displays the
double folding potential as predicted for the following
functionals:SV-mas07, SV-mas08, SV-mas10, SV-sym28,
SV-sym30, SV-sym32, and SV-sym34. We observe (red
lines) that the folding potential is essentially unchanged
as the eﬀective mass is varied from 0.7 to 1.0. Instead,
we ﬁnd high sensitivity to the symmetry energy parame-
ter J. The potential peak is largest for the smallest value
J = 28 MeV and is reduced by as much as 0.5 MeV for SV-
sym34, which has J = 34 MeV. This ﬁnding is consistent
with our expectations. A model with a soft symmetry en-
ergy (such as SV-sym28) predicts a slow increase in the

neutron skin; in contrast, a stiﬀ symmetry energy gener-
ates a thick neutron skin (see Table II). A thick neutron
skin enhances the overlap region as the nuclei begin to
touch, thereby resulting in a lower Coulomb barrier. And
although half an MeV (out of about 50 MeV) may seem
as a mild reduction, one must recall that nuclear fusion
near the Coulomb barrier depends exponentially on the
height of the barrier.

6

that the neutron radius is highly sensitive to the symme-
try energy. Given that the folding potential uses frozen
densities, the height of the peak is highly sensitive to
the extent of the nuclear skin. In particular, SV-sym28,
which predicts the smallest neutron radius in 48Ca, gen-
erates the highest peak in the potential since the nuclei
can reach a smaller ion-ion separation distance R before
the outer densities start to overlap. That is, a small neu-
tron skin “delays” the impact of the nuclear attraction to
smaller values of R causing an increase in the height of
the Coulomb barrier. Moreover, a smaller neutron skin
also manifests itself by having the peak in the potential
shift to a smaller value of R relative to SV-sym34 which,
with the stiﬀest symmetry energy, generates the largest
neutron skin.

We next examine the fusion cross section for the
48Ca+48Ca system interacting via the ion-ion potentials
shown in Fig. 2. When the ion-ion collision is reduced to
an ion-ion interaction potential dependent on the col-
lective coordinate R the fusion barrier penetrabilities
TL(Ec.m.) can be obtained by numerical integration of
the two-body Schr¨odinger equation

using the incoming wave boundary condition (IWBC)
method [85]. The potential V (R, E) is the sum of nu-
clear and Coulomb potentials. IWBC assumes that once
the minimum of the potential is reached fusion will occur.
In practice, the Schr¨odinger equation is integrated from
the potential minimum, Rmin, where only an incoming
wave is assumed, to a large asymptotic distance, where
it is matched to incoming and outgoing Coulomb wave-
functions. The barrier penetration factor, TL(Ec.m.) is
the ratio of the incoming ﬂux at Rmin to the incoming
Coulomb ﬂux at large distances. Here we implement the
IWBC method exactly as it is formulated for the coupled-
channel code CCFULL described in Ref. [85]. This gives
us a consistent way for calculating cross sections at above
and below the barrier via

To elucidate the sensitivity of the 48Ca+48Ca fusion cross
section to the various EDF parametrizations, we have
plotted in Fig. 3 the ratio of the calculated cross sections
as a function of center-of-mass energy for the potential
barriers shown in Fig. 2 relative to the fusion cross section
obtained from the base parametrization SV-bas. The top
and bottom panels of Fig. 3 correspond to the potentials
displayed in the top and bottom panels of Fig. 2. We
have adopted the same vertical scale in both panels to
emphasize the relative enhancement/quenching factors.
The shaded region indicates the range of barrier heights
for the potentials shown in Fig. 2. As expected, and fully
consistent with our discussion of the potential VF (R),
changes in the symmetry energy have by far the largest

The folding potentials corresponding to the systematic
variation of the incompressibility coeﬃcient K and the
enhancement factor κTRK are now plotted in Fig. 2(b).
Here we observe essentially no dependence on κTRK but
some sensitivity, albeit small, to K. Larger values of the
incompressibility result in a higher potential peak, with
the total diﬀerence between the highest and lowest peaks
being about 0.25 MeV.

As already alluded, these results are fully consis-
tent with the variation of the ground-state properties
of 48Ca—especially the neutron r.m.s. radius shown in
Fig. 1. Indeed, the bottom row of Fig. 1 clearly indicates

impact on the fusion cross section—particularly below
the Coulomb barrier. This is followed by the nuclear in-
compressibility, which displays a signiﬁcant dependence,
and ﬁnally by the eﬀective mass and TRK enhancement
factor both displaying minimal impact on the cross sec-
tion.

We close this section by showing in Fig. 4 the calculated
48Ca+48Ca fusion-excitation function against the exper-
imental data [78]. Note that the exponential nature of
quantum-mechanical tunneling below the Coulomb bar-
rier demands the use of a logarithmic scale, as the fu-
sion cross section varies over six orders of magnitude in
a 10 MeV interval in center-of-mass energy. Although on
such a scale it is diﬃcult to discern signiﬁcant diﬀerences
among the predictions of the models, some general trends
emerge. Indeed, whereas the model predictions for the
cross section above the Coulomb barrier are in reasonable
agreement with experiment, the data below the barrier is
consistently underestimated. We attribute this discrep-
ancy to the fact that the folding-potential with frozen
densities is a poor approximation inside the barrier due
to an unphysical density that is grossly overestimated
in the overlap region. We note that for c.m. energies
above the barrier—where the sensitivity to the neutron-
skin thickness ceases to be critical—all SV forces produce
similar results, with the cross sections corresponding to
SV-sym34 showing the best overall agreement. To pro-
vide an improved theoretical description of the cross sec-
tion and to further examine the sensitivity of the fusion
cross section to the underlying SV forces, we relax in the
next section the double-folding approximation in favor of
a DC-TDHF approach.

B. DC-TDHF Method

The folding-model calculations ignore dynamical ef-
fects such as neck formation, particle exchange, pre-
equilibrium GDR and other modes during the nuclear
overlap phase of the reaction. During this phase of the
collision the primary underlying mechanism is the dy-
namical change in the density along the fusion path which
modiﬁes the potential energy. Obviously, this density
change is not instantaneous. For instance, it was shown
in Ref. [86] that the development of a neck due to cou-
plings to octupole phonons in 40Ca+40Ca could take ap-
proximately one zeptosecond. As a consequence, the dy-
namical change of the density is most signiﬁcant at low
energy (near the barrier-top) where the colliding partners
spend enough time in the vicinity of each other with lit-
tle relative kinetic energy. At high energies, however, the
nuclei overcome the barrier essentially in their ground-
state density. This energy dependence of the eﬀect of
the couplings on the density evolution was clearly shown
in TDHF calculations by Washiyama and Lacroix [87].
This naturally translates into an energy dependence of
the nucleus-nucleus potential [88, 89], similar to what was
introduced phenomenologically in the S˜ao-Paulo poten-

tial [90]. Consequently, the barrier corresponding to near
barrier-top energies includes dynamical couplings eﬀects
and can be referred to as a dynamic-adiabatic barrier,
while at high energy the nucleus-nucleus interaction is
determined by a sudden potential which can be calcu-
lated assuming frozen ground-state densities.

In the DC-TDHF approach [91] the TDHF time-
evolution takes place without any restrictions. At cer-
tain times during the evolution the instantaneous den-
sity is used to perform a static Hartree-Fock minimiza-
tion while holding the neutron and proton densities con-
strained to be the corresponding instantaneous TDHF
densities [92, 93].
In essence, this provides us with
the TDHF dynamical path in relation to the multi-
dimensional static energy surface of the combined nuclear
system. The advantage of DC-TDHF in comparison to
the frozen-density approximation of the previous section
is obvious. The density is, in fact, not frozen, but polar-
ized in the ﬁeld of the neighbor fragment during collision.
This is naturally taken into account in the TDHF prop-

the DC-TDHF step. This time-dependent approach au-
tomatically incorporates static and dynamical polariza-
tion eﬀects as there are neck formation, mass exchange,
internal excitations, deformation eﬀects to all orders, as
well as the eﬀect of nuclear alignment for deformed sys-
tems. In the DC-TDHF method the ion-ion interaction
potential is given by

VDC(R) = EDC(R) − EA1 − EA2 ,

(5)

where EDC is the density-constrained energy at the in-
stantaneous separation R(t), while EA1 and EA2 are the
binding energies of the two nuclei obtained with the same
eﬀective interaction.
In writing Eq. (5) we have intro-
duced the concept of an adiabatic reference state for a
given TDHF state. The diﬀerence between these two en-
ergies represents the internal energy. The adiabatic refer-
ence state is the one obtained via the density constraint
calculation, which is the Slater determinant with lowest
energy for the given density with vanishing current and
approximates the collective potential energy [92]. We
would like to emphasize again that this procedure does
not aﬀect the TDHF time-evolution and contains no free
parameters or normalization.

In addition to the ion-ion potential it is also possible
to obtain coordinate dependent mass parameters. One
can compute the “eﬀective mass” M (R) using the con-
servation of energy

M (R) =

2[Ec.m. − VDC(R)]

˙R2

,

(6)

where the collective velocity ˙R is directly obtained from
the TDHF evolution and the potential VDC(R) from
the density constraint calculations. In calculating fusion
cross-sections this coordinate-dependent mass is used to
obtain a transformed ion-ion potential V (R) with an ex-
act point-transformation as described in Ref. [94]. The
coordinate dependent mass only modiﬁes the inner part
of the ion-ion potential and its importance was demon-
strated in Ref. [88, 95]. Recently, the DC-TDHF method
was employed for studying fusion reactions relevant for
the neutron star crust [96, 97].

TDHF and DC-TDHF calculations were done in a
three-dimensional Cartesian geometry with no symmetry
assumptions and using the SV EDFs discussed above [98].
The three-dimensional Poisson equation for the Coulomb
potential
is solved by using Fast-Fourier Transform
(FFT) techniques [99]. The static HF equations and the
DC-TDHF minimizations are implemented by using the
damped gradient iteration method [92, 93, 100, 101]. The
box size used for the TDHF calculations in order to utilize
the DC-TDHF method was chosen to be 60×30×30 fm3,
with a mesh spacing of 1.0 fm in all directions. These val-
ues provide very accurate results due to the employment
of sophisticated discretization techniques [99, 102].
In
Fig. 5 we plot the ion-ion potentials for the 48Ca+48Ca
system employing the DC-TDHF method. In this rather

expensive fully time-dependent approach, we have only
calculated the potentials for the SV forces correspond-
ing to the extreme values of the nuclear matter param-
eters. In Fig. 5(a) we plot the potentials for EDFs SV-
sym28, SV-sym34, SV-mas07, and SV-mas10. Similar to
the folding potentials we observe appreciable dependence
on symmetry energy but little dependence on the eﬀec-
tive mass, although there seems to be a bit more depen-
dence in comparison to the folding-potential case. Fig-
ure 5(b) depicts the DC-TDHF potentials corresponding
the EDFs SV-K216, SV-K241, SV-kap00, and SV-kap60.
For these EDFs we see, again, an appreciable dependence
on incompressibility but unlike the folding-potential case
we see a stronger dependence on the value of κTRK. This
suggests that the dependence on κTRK is more sensitive
to the dynamics such as the formation of a neck and par-
ticle transfer which, in fact, is not so surprising because
κTRK is the dynamical isovector response parameter (see
Appendix A).

The calculation of the fusion cross-sections using the
DC-TDHF potentials employs the same IWBC approach
used for the fusion cross-section calculations for double-
folding potentials. Again, to better elucidate the depen-
dence of fusion cross-sections on EDF parametrizations
in Fig. 6 we plot the ratio of the calculated cross-sections
corresponding to the potential barriers shown in Fig. 5 to
the fusion cross-section of the SV-bas potential barrier as

a function of c.m. energy. The shaded area indicates the
range of potential barrier heights for the potentials used
in the study. We note that the dynamical barriers are
300−500 keV lower than the ones obtained from folding
potentials. The experimental data [78] scaled also by the
SV-bas cross-sections are shown as ﬁlled circles. A num-
ber of important points may be deduced from Fig. 6.
We again observe that NMP corresponding to symme-
try energy has the largest impact on the variation of the
cross-sections. This is followed by incompressibility. A
surprising observation is that the parameter κ induces
a substantial variation in the cross-sections in this case,
whereas it has practically no impact in the case of the
folding potential approach. This indicates that the dy-
namics plays an important role in determining the im-
portant and correct NMP for nuclear reactions. What
is also striking is that the parametrizations SV-mas10
and SV-kap60, and to a smaller extent SV-K241 and SV-
sym28 provide an excellent description of the above bar-
rier fusion data. However, at below barrier energies the
dependence on NMP is much more complicated, namely
a strong energy dependence.

Again, in Fig. 7 we plot the calculated fusion cross-
sections on a logarithmic scale. Also shown are the ex-
perimental data (circles) from Ref. [78]. Before focusing
on the details we observe that the DC-TDHF ion-ion po-
tentials considerably improve the agreement with data at
sub-barrier energies. This is due to the incorporation of
neck dynamics in the construction of the potential, which
modiﬁes the inner part of the barrier. In fact the results
are surprisingly good since the used EDFs do not in-
clude any reaction data for parameter ﬁtting. One more
important observation is that most DC-TDHF calcula-

tions to date have used the SLy4 [103] forces and one
common discrepancy was always identiﬁed in the energy
regime slightly above the barrier peak. We note that
some of the SV forces, particularly SV-sym34 and SV-
K218, seem to do a very good job in this regime but not
as well at deep sub-barrier energies, where SV-sym28 and
SV-K241 do better at these energies. It would be interest-
ing to see if it is possible to construct an SV force which
encompasses both nuclear matter values to see whether
the complete energy regime can be reproduced.
If we
examine the DC-TDHF fusion cross-sections on a linear
scale we again observe that the forces reproducing the
barrier peak energy regime (SV-sym34, SV-mas07, SV-
K218, SV-kap00) slightly overestimate the higher energy
cross-sections whereas the forces that reproduce high en-
ergy cross-sections (SV-sym28, SV-mas10, SV-K241, SV-
kap60) underestimate the barrier peak region.

The example shows that (dynamical) rearrangement of
the colliding densities is crucial for a detailed reproduc-
tion of the fusion cross section. But the basic trends are
already set by the folding model which relies exclusively
on the neutron density distributions of the ground states
of the colliding nuclei. And these densities are most sen-
sitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy.

of the fusion cross section to the neutron-skin thickness
of 48Ca we have generated a set of “SV-L forces” that
keep all NMP ﬁxed at the SV-bas values and vary exclu-
sively the slope of the symmetry energy L. In Fig. 8 we
plot the potential barrier height for all of the forces used
in this study. For the folding-model potentials we ob-

serve an almost linear relationship between the neutron
skin and the barrier height. This is expected since the
densities are frozen. On the other hand, for the Skyrme
parametrizations introduced in [59], we observe a more
complicated behavior in our predictions, although at the
extremes there is a clear sensitivity to the variations of
the symmetry energy. We observe that each subset of
parametrizations show a nearly linear trend with the pro-
vision that they have diﬀering slopes. As expected, the
systematically varied SV-L forces also display an almost
linear correlation. In Fig. 9 we plot the SV parametriza-
tions that best reproduce the data around the barrier top
energies. We emphasize that these forces do reproduce
the experimental data to a remarkable accuracy, with er-
rors being on the order of a few millibarns. While it is not
straightforward to pinpoint an unique set of NMP that
provide the best agreement with the data, we observe
that there is a tradeoﬀ between having a stiﬀ symmetry
energy and a corresponding large neutron neutron-skin
versus a softer symmetry energy and a somewhat smaller
neutron-skin. Our analysis suggests a value for the sym-
metry energy closer to J = 30 MeV with a relatively small
neutron skin. Indeed, a neutron-skin thickness in 48Ca
of Rskin = (0.180−0.210) fm provides the optimal repro-
duction of the data.

In the case of direct TDHF calculations of fusion cross
sections the situation is diﬀerent because they do not
include sub-barrier tunneling of the many-body wave-
function. That is, the fusion probability, Pf us.(L, Ec.m.),
for a particular orbital angular momentum L at the
center-of-mass energy Ec.m. can only be either P T DHF

Here µ is the reduced mass of the system and Lmax is the

formula [104].

To calculate the fusion cross-section within TDHF it is
necessary to make many TDHF calculations to map out
the maximum impact parameter for each energy of inter-
est. We restrict our direct TDHF calculations to explore
the systematic variation of the symmetry energy, since
these showed the largest dependence in the DC-TDHF
calculations. Figure 10 shows the calculated and experi-
mental cross-sections for the SV-sym28, SV-bas, and SV-
sym34 forces, with symmetry energies 28 MeV, 30 MeV,

two 48Ca nuclei is expected to be dominated by the spa-
tial extent of its neutron distribution. This expectation
was convincingly validated in this work.
Indeed, mod-
els that predict a small neutron skin in 48Ca delay the
impact of the nuclear attraction to smaller values of the
ion-ion separation causing an increase in the height of the
Coulomb barrier relative to models with larger neutron
skins. As a result, we have established the following cor-
relation: the larger the neutron-skin thickness of 48Ca,
the larger the 48Ca+48Ca sub-barrier fusion cross sec-
tion. Based on the limited set of systematically varied
Skyrme forces employed in this work, our results seem
to favor a slope for the symmetry energy of L ≈ 50 MeV
and a corresponding neutron-skin thickness in 48Ca of
Rskin = (0.180−0.210) fm.

The determination of the neutron-skin thickness of a
variety of nuclei with a signiﬁcant neutron excess pro-
vides critical information on the poorly-known isovector
sector of the nuclear energy density functional. In turn,
constraining the isovector sector determines the equa-
tion of state of neutron-rich matter, particularly the den-
sity dependence of the symmetry energy. The EOS of
neutron-rich matter provides a powerful bridge between
nuclear physics and astrophysics.
Indeed, models that
predict a large neutron skin in heavy nuclei also tend to
predict large neutron-star radii. This correlation emerges
since the same pressure that pushes against surface ten-
sion to generate the neutron skin pushes against grav-
ity to shape the stellar radius. Remarkably, this cor-
relation involves a disparity in length scales of 18 or-
ders of magnitude! In this contribution we ﬁnd another
compelling connection between nuclear physics and as-
trophysics. Whereas sub-barrier fusion is hindered by
the Coulomb barrier, the merger of two neutron stars is
hindered by a large centrifugal barrier. Yet, the fusion
of two neutron-rich nuclei or the merger of two neutron
stars are both greatly enhanced by a stiﬀ symmetry en-
ergy that produces large neutron skins and large stellar
radii.

Ultimately, the most accurate determination of the
neutron-skin thickness of 48Ca will come from CREX—a
parity-violating experiment that relies exclusively on the
electro-weak nature of the electron probe. Yet, even un-
der the most optimistic scenarios CREX is several years
down the road. In the meantime, it is fruitful to explore
complimentary approaches that probe similar physics. In
this contribution we have established—in spite of some
inherent hadronic uncertainties—that 48Ca+48Ca fusion
near the Coulomb barrier is an attractive complement
to CREX because of the exponential sensitivity of the
reaction to the spatial distribution of neutrons.

the calculations show the accuracy of determination of
the critical impact parameter for each energy point indi-
cated.

One notices that the results show the same systematic
trends as the DC-TDHF calculations, namely, a softer
symmetry energy gives a lower cross section. In partic-
ular, the force with a symmetry energy of J = 28 MeV
seems to be slightly favored by the experimental data
when the collision energy is greater than about 55 MeV,
whereas models with a stiﬀer symmetry energies agree
better near the barrier. The inability of direct TDHF
calculations to reproduce the fusion cross section below
the barrier is evident from the logarithmic plot, where
the transition to zero cross section is seen for all forces in
the region between 51 and 52 MeV center of mass energy.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

Elucidating the nature of the nuclear force that binds
protons and neutrons into stable nuclei and rare isotopes
is one of the overarching questions in nuclear science. In
this paper we focused on the role that sub-barrier fusion
may play in constraining the neutron density of 48Ca, and
in particular its neutron-rich skin. Being dominated by
quantum-mechanical tunneling, the sub-barrier fusion of

symmetry energy which allows to estimate the symmetry
energy at half density, i.e. at surface of ﬁnite nuclei.

The NMP in Table I can be grouped into four classes:
ﬁrst, the (isoscalar) ground state properties ρeq and
E/A
isoscalar response properties K and
m∗/m, and third,
isovector response properties J, L,
κTRK. The response properties determine zero sound in
matter [106] and subsequently they are closely related to
giant resonance modes in ﬁnite nuclei. There is a further
category, the surface energies which go already beyond
homogeneous matter and whose deﬁnition is rather in-
volved [36]. They are not considered here.

, C τ

0 , C ρ,α

Homogeneous matter yields ∆ρ = 0 and (cid:126)J = 0 which,
in turn, renders four terms in the functional (A2) inac-
tive. Thus we have exactly seven interaction parameters
(C ρ
0 , α) to determine seven NMP. The relation
is reversible establishing a one-to-one correspondence be-
tween both sets. This allows to consider the NMP equiv-
alently as model parameters which is, in fact, a more
intuitive way to ultimately determine the model param-
eters.

The fact that the NMP describes basic characteristics
of a nuclear EDF suggests that one should explore an
EDF by systematic variation of the NMP in the vicin-

13

ity of the values for the optimum EDF. This had been
worked in detail in [59] delivering a set of systematically
varied Skyrme parametrizations. As explained in Sec. II,
we are using this set here for exploration of fusion. The
detailed EDF parameters are given in [59]. Table II sum-
marizes the NMP for the members of this set.
