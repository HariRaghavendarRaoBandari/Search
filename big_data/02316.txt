KIRILLOV-FRENKEL CHARACTER FORMULA FOR LOOP

GROUPS, RADIAL PART AND BROWNIAN SHEET

valuable aid especially in the work presented here.

Abstract. We consider the coadjoint action of a Loop group of a compact
group on the dual of the corresponding centrally extended Loop algebra and
prove that a Brownian motion in a Cartan subalgebra conditioned to remain
in an aﬃne Weyl chamber - which can be seen as a space time conditioned
Brownian motion - is distributed as the radial part process of a Brownian sheet
on the underlying Lie algebra.

1. Introduction

It is a famous result that a real Brownian motion conditioned in Doob’s sense to
remain positive, is distributed as a Bessel 3 process, i.e. as the radial process of a 3-
dimensional Brownian motion. More generally, if one considers the adjoint action of
a compact Lie group on its Lie algebra, the radial part process of a Brownian motion
in the Lie algebra is distributed as a Brownian motion in a Cartan subalgebra
conditioned to remain in a Weyl chamber. In this paper, we consider the coadjoint
action of a Loop group of a compact group on the dual of the corresponding centrally
extended Loop algebra and prove that a Brownian motion in a Cartan subalgebra
conditioned to remain in an aﬃne Weyl chamber - which can be seen as a space
time conditioned Brownian motion - is distributed as the radial part process of a
Brownian sheet on the underlying Lie algebra.

Let us be more precise. Let K be a connected compact Lie group, k its Lie
algebra, and t a Cartan subalgebra. One considers a Weyl chamber in t. Then the
orbits of k under the adjoint action of K are parametrized by the Weyl chamber.
Actually for any x ∈ k, it exists a unique vector in the Weyl chamber which is in
the same orbit as x. This vector is called the radial part of x. The Lie algebra k is
equipped with an Ad(K)-invariant scalar product, whose restriction to the Cartan
subalgebra is invariant for the action of the Weyl group. If we consider the radial
part process of a standard Brownian motion on k, it is a classical fact that this
process is distributed as its projection on the Cartan subalgebra t - which is a
Brownian motion on t - conditioned in Doob’s sense to remain forever in the Weyl

chamber. The Kirillov’s character formula is at the heart of the connection between
the two processes.

An aﬃne Lie algebra can be realized as a central extension of a loop algebra Lk.
Considering the coadjoint action of the loop group LK on the dual of the centrally
extended loop algebra, one deﬁnes the radial part of an element of this dual algebra
(see Pressley and Segal [17]). Frenkel established in [9] a Kirillov character type
formula in the framework of aﬃne Lie algebras considering a Gaussian measure on
the dual of Lk - basically a Brownian motion on k. In his approach, the conditional
law of a Brownian motion on k given its radial part provides a natural measure
on the corresponding orbit under the action of LK. It highly suggested that one
could construct a process on a loop algebra, whose the radial part process would
be distributed as a projection on a Cartan subalgebra, conditioned to remain in an
aﬃne Weyl chamber.

The aﬃne Weyl chamber is a fundamental domain for the action of the Weyl
group on the Tits cone. The ﬁrst diﬃculty is that there is no Euclidean structure
on the Cartan subalgebra of an aﬃne Lie algebra, which would be invariant for the
action the Weyl group. So there is no natural Brownian motion to consider on it.
The Kirillov’s orbit method, on which we based our intuition, suggests a connection
between coadjoint orbits for the action of a Loop group on the dual of an aﬃne Lie
algebra and irreducible representations of the aﬃne Lie algebra. Tensor product
of irreducible representations of an aﬃne Lie algebra makes appear a drift in the
direction of the fundamental weight Λ0. The idea is to consider a process with
such a drift in the direction of Λ0 - which can be seen as a time component - living
in an aﬃne Lie algebra. In this paper, we construct such a process, considering a
Brownian sheet on the Lie algebra k and prove that the corresponding radial part
process is distributed as a projection on a Cartan subalgebra, conditioned to remain
forever in an aﬃne Weyl chamber.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe the orbits for the
coadjoint action of a Loop group of a compact group on the dual of the associated
In particular we deﬁne a notion of radial part
centrally extended loop algebra.
for this action, which is suitable for our context.
In section 4 we brieﬂy recall
the necessary background on representation theory of aﬃne Lie algebras. Sections
3 and 5 are basically a reformulation of the main results of [9]. In section 3 we
compute the conditional law of a Brownian motion indexed by [0, 1] given the end
point of its stochastic exponentiel. In section 5 we recall how Frenkel proves that
this conditional law leads to a Kirillov character formula for aﬃne Lie algebras. In
section 6 we introduce a Brownian motion on a Cartan subalgebra of an aﬃne Lie
algebra conditioned - in Doob’s sense - to remain forever in an aﬃne Weyl chamber.
We prove in section 7 that this conditioned Doob process has the same law as the
radial part process of a Brownian sheet on k.

2. Action of Loop group and its orbits

Loop group and its action. The following presentation is largely inspired by the
one given in [17]. Let K be a connected, simply connected, compact Lie group and
k its Lie algebra. By compactness, without loss of generality, we suppose that K is
a matrix Lie group. The adjoint action of K on itself, which is denoted by Ad, is
deﬁned by Ad(k)(u) = kuk∗, k, u ∈ K. The induced adjoint action of K on its Lie
algebra k is still denoted by Ad and is deﬁned by Ad(k)(x) = kxk∗, k ∈ K, x ∈ k.

The Lie bracket on k is denoted by [., .]k. We equipp k with an Ad(K)−invariant
inner product (., .), i.e. the negative of the Killing form. We denote by e the identity
of K. We consider the group Map([0, 1], K) of Borel measurable maps from [0, 1]
to K, the group law being pointwise composition, and the subgroup LK of smooth
loops from [0, 1] to K,

LK = {f : [0, 1] → K, f is smooth , f (0) = f (1)}.

The Lie algebra Lk over R of LK is the loop algebra of smooth loops from to [0, 1] to
k. We deﬁne a centrally extended Lie algebra Lk ⊕ Rc equipped with a Lie bracket
given by

for ξ, η ∈ Lk, λ, µ ∈ R, where ω is the cocycle deﬁned by ω(ξ, η) =(cid:82) 1

0 (ξ(cid:48)(t), η(t)) dt,
and [ξ, η]k is deﬁned pointwise. A Cartan subalgebra of the extended Loop algebra
is t ⊕ Rc, where t is identiﬁed with the set of t-valued constant loops. The Lie
bracket actually deﬁnes a Lie algebra action of Lk on Lk ⊕ Rc given by

[ξ + λc, η + µc] = [ξ, η]k + ω(ξ, η)c,

ξ.(η + µc) = [ξ, η] + ω(ξ, η)c,

for any ξ ∈ Lk, (η, µ) ∈ Lk × R. This action comes from the adjoint action of LK
on Lk ⊕ Rc deﬁned by

Notice that the coadjoint action of the loop group doesn’t aﬀect the level, i.e. the
coordinate in Λ0. Let us equipp Lk with the L2-norm, and consider its completion
L2([0, 1], k) with respect with the L2-norm. We deﬁne
LH 1([0, 1], K) = {γ : [0, 1] → K, γ is absolutely continuous, γ−1γ(cid:48) ∈ L2([0, 1], k), γ(0) = γ(1)}

H 1([0, 1], k) = {f : ([0, 1] → k, f is absolutely continuous, f(cid:48) ∈ L2([0, 1], k), f (0) = 0},
H 1([0, 1], K) = {h : [0, 1] → K, h is absolutely continuous, h−1h(cid:48) ∈ L2([0, 1], k), h(0) = e}.
If we denote by (L2([0, 1], k))(cid:48) the topological dual of L2([0, 1], k) then (2) deﬁnes

There is another way to make this action appear naturally. One deﬁnes a group
action of the loop group LH 1([0, 1], K) on H 1([0, 1], K) by letting for any γ ∈
LH 1([0, 1], K),

for h ∈ H 1([0, 1], K) and t ∈ [0, 1]. The set H 1([0, 1], K) is in one to one cor-
respondence with the set H 1([0, 1], k). Actually for λ ∈ R∗, this is a classical
result of diﬀerential geometry that for any path x ∈ H 1([0, 1], k) it exists a unique
X ∈ H 1([0, 1], K) such that λ dX = X dx. For any x ∈ H 1([0, 1], k), and λ ∈ R∗,
one deﬁnes (x + λΛ0) as the unique map in H 1([0, 1], K) which satisﬁes this dif-
ferential equation. As

λ d(γ0(x + λΛ0)γ−1) = γ0(x + λΛ0)γ−1(γdxγ−1 − λdγγ−1),

the action of LH 1([0, 1], K) on H 1([0, 1], K), and the action of LH 1([0, 1], K) on
H 1([0, 1], k) ⊕ RΛ0, satisfy

(γ.(x + λΛ0)) = γ.(x + λΛ0)

when λ (cid:54)= 0.
Roots and weights. We choose a maximal torus T of K and denote by t its Lie
algebra. We denote by g the complexiﬁcation of k, i.e. g = k ⊕ ik. We consider the
set of real roots

R = {α ∈ t∗ : ∃X ∈ g \ {0}, ∀H ∈ t, [H, X] = 2iπα(H)X}.

We choose a set Σ of simple roots of R and denote by R+ the set of positive roots.
The half sum of positive roots is denoted by ρ. Letting for α ∈ R,

gα = {X ∈ g : ∀H ∈ t, [H, X] = 2iπα(H)X},

θ∨ is the highest coroot. We denote respectively by Q =(cid:80)

the coroot α∨ of α ∈ Σ is deﬁned to be the only vector of t in [gα, g−α] such that
α(α∨) = 2. The dual Coxeter number denoted by h∨ is equal to 1 + ρ(θ∨), where
Zα∨
the root and the coroot lattice. The weight lattice {λ ∈ t∗ : λ(α∨) ∈ Z, ∀α ∈ Σ}
is denoted by P and the set {λ ∈ t∗ : λ(α∨) ∈ N, ∀α ∈ Σ} of dominant weights is
denoted by P+.

For α ∈ Σ the fundamental reﬂection sα∨ is deﬁned on t by

sα∨(x) = x − α(x)α∨,

for x ∈ t.

We consider the extended aﬃne Weyl group generated by the reﬂections sα∨ and
the translations by α∨, x ∈ t (cid:55)→ x + α∨, for α ∈ Σ. The fundamental domain for
its action on t is

A = {x ∈ t : ∀α ∈ R+, 0 ≤ α(x) ≤ 1}

(see for instance section 4.8 of [11]). For x ∈ K, one deﬁnes Ox as the adjoint orbit
through x, i.e.

Ox = {y ∈ K : ∃u ∈ K, y = uxu∗}.

We consider the exponential map exp : k → K. As K is simply connected, the set of
conjugacy classes K/ Ad(K) is in one-to-one correspondence with the fundamental
domain A, i.e. for all u ∈ K, it exists a unique x ∈ A such that u ∈ Oexp(x) (see
[4] for instance). Thus given λ ∈ R∗
+, every paths in H 1([0, 1], k) is conjugated to a
straight path

s ∈ [0, 1] (cid:55)→ sy,

for some y ∈ A, and one can give the following deﬁnition for the radial part of
x ∈ H 1([0, 1], k), given a positive level λ ∈ R∗
+.
Deﬁnition 2.2. For (x, λ) ∈ H 1([0, 1], k) × R∗
+, one deﬁnes the radial part of
x + λΛ0 as the unique element r in A such that (x + λΛ0)1 ∈ Oexp(r). It is denoted
by rad(x + λΛ0).

Radial part of a continuous semi-martingale. The aim of this part is to deﬁne
the radial part of a k-valued Brownian path. Such a path is not in H 1([0, 1], k) but
one can deﬁne a stochastic exponential of a Brownian path, which allows us to deﬁne
its radial part, by analogy with what we’ve done above. Let (Ω,F, (Fs)s∈[0,1], P)
be a ﬁltered probability space. The following results have been proved for instance
in [12] or [15]. If (xs)s∈[0,1] is an k-valued continuous semi-martingale and λ ∈ R∗
+,
then the stochastic diﬀerential equation

λ dX = X ◦ dx,

(4)
where ◦ stands for the Stratonovitch integral, has a unique solution starting from e.
Such a solution is a K-valued process, that we still denote by ((x + λΛ0)s)s∈[0,1].
This is the Stratonovitch stochastic exponential of x
+, x
can be recovered from (x + λΛ0) as dx = λ (x + λΛ0)−1 ◦ d(x + λΛ0).
Deﬁnition 2.3. For λ ∈ R∗
+, and x = (xs)s∈[0,1] a continuous k-valued semi-
martingale, one deﬁnes the radial part of (x + λΛ0) as the unique element r in A
such that (x + λΛ0)1 ∈ Oexp(r). It is denoted by rad(x + λΛ0).

3. The Conditional law of a brownian motion in k given the

end-point of its stochastic exponential

We denote by Λ the kernel of the restriction exp|t and by Λ∗ the set of in-
tegral weights {λ ∈ t∗ : λ(Λ) ∈ Z}, which is included in P since α∨ ∈ Λ (see
[4] for instance). Thus, we deﬁne an application ϑλ on T , when λ ∈ Λ∗, by let-
ting ϑλ(exp(x)) = e2iπλ(x), for x ∈ t. The irreducible representations of K are
+ = Λ∗ ∩ C∨, where C∨ = {λ ∈ t∗ : λ(α∨) ≥ 0, α ∈ Σ}.
parametrized by the set Λ∗
Here, K is supposed to be simply connected, so that P = Λ∗ and P+ = Λ∗
+. We
denote by chλ the character of the irreducible representation with highest weight
λ ∈ P+. We recall that t is equipped with a W -invariant scalar product (., .). We
identify and t and t∗ via (., .) and still denote by (., .) the scalar product on t∗. We
write sometimes ex instead of exp(x), for x ∈ k.
Brownian motion on K. Let (Ω, (Fs)s∈[0,1], P) be a probability space, where
(Fs)s∈[0,1] is the natural ﬁltration of a k-valued standard continuous Brownian mo-

the stochastic exponential (xσ + λΛ0) only for λ = 1. As for any λ ∈ R∗

(xσ + λΛ0) = (x

(xσ) = (xσ + Λ0). The stochastic exponential ((xσ)s)s∈[0,1] is a left Levy process
on K starting from e, with transition probability (pσ

The Killing form on k is from now on normalized such that (θ∨, θ∨) = 2. We
consider its restriction to t and extend it to h by C−linearity, and by letting

(Cc + Cd, t) = 0,

(c, c) = (d, d) = 0,

(c, d) = 1.

The following deﬁnitions mainly come from chapters 1 and 6 of [14]. The linear

Notice that here ν(θ∨) = θ and (θ∨|θ∨) = (θ|θ) = 2. One deﬁnes the Weyl group

Weyl group(cid:99)W is the semi-direct product W (cid:110) Γ (proposition 6.5 chapter 6 of [14])

Under the identiﬁcation of h and h∗, the action of the aﬃne Weyl group on h is

4.2. Weights, highest-weight modules, characters. The following deﬁnitions

and properties mainly come from chapters 9 and 10 of [14]. We denote (cid:98)P (resp.
(cid:98)P+) the set of integral (resp. dominant) weights deﬁned by
i (cid:105) ∈ Z, i = 0, . . . , n},

(cid:98)P = {λ ∈ h∗ : (cid:104)λ, α∨
(resp. (cid:98)P+ = {λ ∈ (cid:98)P : (cid:104)λ, α∨

where (cid:104)., .(cid:105) is the pairing between h and its dual h∗. For λ ∈ (cid:98)P+ we denote V (λ)

i (cid:105) ≥ 0, i = 0, . . . , n}),

the irreducible module with highest weight λ. The Weyl-Kac character’s formula
(Theorem 10.4, chapter 10 of [14]) states that

convergence. Actually the series(cid:88)
µ∈(cid:98)P
converges absolutely for every h ∈ h such that Re(δ(h)) > 0. We denote by (cid:98)chλ(h)
its limit (see chapter 11 of [14]). The limiting function (cid:98)chλ is analytic on the set
(see chapter 12 of [14]). For y ∈ h, we let (cid:98)chy := (cid:98)chν(y).

where U is a random variable distributed according the Haar measure on K. When
the restriction of λ to t (also denoted by λ) is a dominant weight, the Kirillov’s

we notice that the restriction of ϕx to t is equal to y ∈ t (cid:55)→ (y, x1). Thus the law of

associated to ϕπz + Λ0.
6. A Brownian motion on Rd ⊕ t conditioned to remain on the affine

Weyl chamber

Let us consider a standard Brownian motion (bt)t≥0 on t. We consider a random
process (τt, bt)t≥0 on R×t as follows. For u0 ∈ R, x0 ∈ t, denote Wu0,x0 a probability
under which τt = u0 + t, for all t ≥ 0, and (bt)t≥0 is a standard Brownian motion
starting from x0. We let xt = τtd+bt, for t ≥ 0. The process (xt)t≥0 is a space-time
Brownian motion, τt being the time component. Let us consider the stopping time

T = inf{t ≥ 0 : xt /∈ (cid:98)C} = inf{t ≥ 0 : bt /∈ τtA}.
2 (cid:98)ϕd+y(τt, bt), t ≥ 0) is a true martingale under Wx,u.

Lemma 6.1. Let u > 0 and (bt)t≥0 be a standard Brownian motion on t. For
y ∈ t ⊕ it, (e− (y,y)t
Proof. Let us suppose that π(y) (cid:54)= 0. Choose an orthonormal basis v1, . . . , vn of t

and consider for w ∈(cid:99)W a function gw deﬁned on R∗

(

∆ + ∂t)gw = 0,

which implies that (gw(t + u, bt))t≥0 is a local martingale.
Its quadratic varia-
tion is easily shown to be integrable, so that, it is a true martingale. The sum

(cid:80)
w∈(cid:99)W (−1)wgw(t + u, bt) converges for the L1 norm, which implies that

t

2 (y,y)ϕd+y(t + u, bt), t ≥ 0),

(e

is also a true martingale. Continuity in y ensures that lemma is true for any
y ∈ t ⊕ it.
(cid:3)

Lemma 6.2. Let t > 0. If td + x ∈ (cid:98)C, i.e. x ∈ tA, then (cid:98)ϕd(t, x) ≥ 0, with equality
if and only if td + x is on the boundary of (cid:98)C, i.e. x is on the boundary of tA.

Proof. Proposition 5.6 implies that for any z ∈ k,

for z ∈ tA, with equality if and only if z ∈ t∂A.

Let (Ft)t≥0 be the natural ﬁltration of (xt)t≥0. As ((cid:98)ϕd(τt∧T , bt∧T ), t ≥ 0), is a
positive true martingale under Wx,u such that (cid:98)ϕd(T, bT ) = 0, one deﬁnes a measure

Actually this conditioned Doob process can be obtained as a limit of a space
time Brownian motion starting in the aﬃne Weyl chamber, with drift within the
aﬃne Weyl chamber, conditioned to remain forever in it, when the drift goes to
zero (see [7] and [8] for more details). Lemma 6.1 and the fact that for y ∈ t ⊕ it,

(cid:98)ϕd+y(τT , bT ) = 0 imply immediately the following proposition.

7. Conditioned space time brownian motion, and radial part of a

Brownian sheet

In this last section we prove that the conditioned Doob process in an aﬃne Weyl
chamber previously introduced, has the same law as the radial part process of a
Brownian sheet on k. It is stated in theorem 7.7. Let (xt
s)s∈[0,1],t∈R+ be a standard
Brownian sheet on k, i.e. for any t, t(cid:48) ∈ R, (xt(cid:48)+t
s)s∈[0,1] is a k-valued random
process independent of σ(xr
s )s∈[0,1],
which is a standard Brownian motion on k, with variance t(cid:48). In the sequel we choose
a continuous version of it. Proposition 7.3 and corollary 7.4 prove the existence of
an entrance law for the conditioned process in the aﬃne Weyl chamber introduced
in section 6, and the entrance point 0.
Lemma 7.1. For any y ∈ t ⊕ it,

s, s ∈ [0, 1], r ≤ t), having the same law as (xt(cid:48)
