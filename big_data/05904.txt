1 Introduction

Abstract After an overview of various citations rele-
vant in the context of photon propagation, the relativis-
tic longitudinal Doppler eﬀect and the addition theorem
of velocities are ﬁrst derived taking into account mo-
mentum and energy conservation. Clocks, the trans-
verse Doppler eﬀect and aberration are treated next,
before the Lorentz contraction of rods is discussed. The
Michelson–Morley experiment is described at rest and
in motion with respect to a preferred aether system,
ﬁrst under the assumption of an operation in vacuum.
It is concluded that the aether concept is fully consis-
tent with the formal application of the Special Theory
of Relativity (STR). Whether a determination of the
speed of the laboratory system relative to the aether
is possible, is considered next either for an operation
of the experiment in vacuum or in a medium with an
index of refraction not equal to one. In both cases, the
answer appears to be negative.

The following citation (Einstein 1917, p. 126) high-
lights the importance with regard to the Doppler ef-
fect – discovered by Doppler (1842) – and the aberra-
tion – ﬁrst described by Bradley (1727):

,Denn wie die Theorie der elektromagnetischen
Vorg¨ange sich auch gestalten mag, so wird doch je-
denfalls das D o p p l e r sche Prinzip und das Gesetz
der Aberration erhalten bleiben, [...]’
(Whatever will eventually be the theory of electromag-
netic processes, the D o p p l e r principle and the aberra-
tion law will continue to be valid, [...].)

Since Michelson and Morley (1887) carried out their
famous experiment, the discussion remains inconclusive
on whether or not the vacuum is ﬁlled with some kind
of aether. A recent publication recounts this history
(Kragh and Overduin 2014).

First we want to refer to relevant statements by Ein-

stein and others:
Initially Einstein concluded that a ,,Licht¨ather” (light
aether) would not be compatible with the Special The-
ory of Relativity (STR) (Einstein 1908, p. 413).

von Laue (1908) discussed the Lorentz contraction in
the context of the electron theory (cf. Abraham 1903)
and the STR:

,Nun stimmen beide Theorien [...] ¨uberein. Der Un-
terschied liegt allein in der Form, die sie den be-
wegten Ladungen zuschreiben; denn die eine nimmt
diese als durch die Bewegung nicht beeinﬂußt an,
w¨ahrend sie sich nach der anderen in Richtung der
Geschwindigkeit kontrahieren.
(Both theories
[...] agree. The only diﬀerence concerns the shapes of
moving charges; one theory assumes that they are not
aﬀected, whereas the other gives a contraction in the di-
rection of motion. [...])

[...]’

2

In response to critical remarks by Wiechert (1911), von
Laue (1912) concluded that the existence of the aether
is not a physical, but a philosophical problem. How-
ever, von Laue (1959, p. 83) later diﬀerentiated between
the physical world and the mathematical formulation of
STR:

,Diese verdankt ihr elegantes mathematisches Ge-
wand Hermann MINKOWSKI, der [...] die Zeit als
vierte, den drei Raumkoordinaten gleichberechtigte
Koordinate der vierdimensionalen ,,Welt” einf¨uhrte.
Doch handelt es sich dabei nur um einen sehr
wertvollen mathematischen Kunstgriﬀ; Tieferes, wie
es manche dahinein legen wollten, steckt nicht dahin-
ter.’
(It owes its elegant mathematical guise Hermann MIN-
KOWSKI who [...] introduced time as fourth coordinate
on the same footing with the three spatial coordinates to
form a four-dimensional “World”. However, this is only a
valuable mathematical trick; deeper insight, which some
people want to see behind it, is not involved.)

Schr¨oder (1990) discussed Wiechert’s support of the
aether concept by presenting unpublished material from
about 1919 to 1922 containing the following two state-
ments:

,Da brachte die Relativit¨atstheorie Einsteins gegen
Ende 1905 einen j¨ahen R¨uckschlag (vgl., Einstein
1905b). Zwar wurde die Lorentz’sche Theorie formal
sehr verbessert, denn auf jener Grundlage, welche
durch die Lorentz-Transformation geboten wurde,
haben Einstein und andere ein physikalisch und
mathematisch gleich sch¨ones und weit gedehntes
Bauwerk errichtet, welches f¨ur die Physik unzweifel-
haft einen grossen und dauernden Gewinn darstellt.
Aber damit begn¨ugte man sich nicht; es wurde eine
erkenntnistheoretische Begr¨undung hinzugef¨ugt, die
neue relativistische Gedanken verwertete und zu
Widerspr¨uchen mit der Aethervorstellung f¨uhrte.’
(Einstein’s theory of relativity caused a sudden setback
at the end of 1905 (cf. Einstein 1905b). Admittedly
Lorentz’ Theory was formally very much improved, and
based on the options of the Lorentz transformations, Ein-
stein and others have erected both a beautiful and ex-
tended building that is without doubt of great and last-
ing value for physics. However, in addition, an epistemo-
logical foundation was added with new relativistic ideas
leading to inconsistencies with aether concepts.)

and

‘Ueber die Wesensart des Weltuntergrundes liegen
zwei Vorstellungen im Streit: Die Raumzeitvorstel-
lung und die Aethervorstellung.’
(On the nature of the substratum of the world two ideas
are in conﬂict: the concept of spacetime und the aether.)

In contrast to earlier statements, Einstein said at the

end of his speech in Leiden (Einstein 1920):

,Gem¨aß der allgemeinen Relativit¨atstheorie ist ein
Raum ohne ¨Ather undenkbar; [...].’
(According to the General Theory of Relativity (GTR)
a space without aether cannot be conceived; [...]).

He made a similar statement elsewhere (Einstein 1924,
p. 93):

,Man k¨onnte statt von ,, ¨Ather” also ebensogut von
,,physikalischen Qualit¨aten des Raumes” sprechen.
[...], werden wir des ¨Athers, d.h. des mit physika-
lischen Eigenschaften ausgestatteten Kontinuums, in
der theoretischen Physik nicht entbehren k¨onnen;
[...].’
(Thus one could instead of talking about ,,aether” as
well discuss the ,,physical properties of space”.
in
theoretical physics we cannot do without aether, i.e., a
continuum endowed with physical properties; [...].)

[...]

In 1927 Michelson confessed at a meeting in Pasade-

na in the presence of H.A. Lorentz:

‘Talking in terms of the beloved old aether (which
is now abandoned, though I personally still cling a
little to it), [...]’ (Michelson et al. 1928, p. 342).

Finally Dirac (1951, p. 906) wrote in a letter to Nature:

‘If one examines the question in the light of present-
day knowledge, one ﬁnds that the æther is no longer
ruled out by relativity, and good reasons can now be
advanced for postulating an æther.’

Considering these statements, it is only appropriate to
revisit the relationship of the mathematical formula-
tion of the STR and its physical contents as well as
to reconsider the aether concept in this paper. We
will denote our laboratory system with S. It contains
physical devices, such as rods, clocks, photons1 emit-
ters and detectors. As far as photons are concerned,
we will frequently refer to the wave-particle dualism
(Einstein 1905a) by quoting their energy h ν, where
h = 6.626 070 040 × 10−34 J s is Planck’s constant (CO-
DATA, 2014) and, at the same time, characterize them
by their frequency ν and wavelength λ. The System S
is either at rest in a putative aether system Sp or moves
with a velocity v relative to Sp.

The important questions are whether such a pre-
ferred aether system, in which the propagation of pho-
tons is isotropic with a speed of light in vacuum c0 =

1Einstein (1905a, p. 133) used the expression ,,Energiequanten”.
The name “photon” was later coined by Lewis (1926).

2 Relativistic longitudinal Doppler eﬀect and

addition theorem of velocities

Guided by Fermi’s explanation of the Doppler eﬀect,
we will now derive a relativistic formulation under the
assumption of the preferred system Sp.

An atom A with mass m in its ground state at rest

in Sp has an energy of

E0 = m c2

0 .

(1)

The energy-momentum relation for a particle in motion
is (cf. Einstein 1905a,c; Dirac 1936; Okun 1989):

E2 = m2 c4

0 + p2c2

0 = m2 c4

0 + p2c2
0 .

(2)

For the atom A with a speed v relative to System Sp,
the energy E can be found with the help of the momen-
tum vector

with β = v/c0 and |β| < 1. Combining Eqs. (2) and (3)

Photon and the aether concept.

299 792 458 m s−1 (exact) (BIPM 2006, p. 22) is com-
patible with physical experiments in laboratory sys-
tems and if – should the answer be in the aﬃrmative –
theoretical and/or experimental methods can be de-
vised to determine the speed v.

Before we embark on this exercise, an interesting re-
mark by Fermi (1932, pp.105/106) should be recalled2:
“The change of frequency of the light emitted from a
moving source is very simply explained by the wave the-
ory of light. But it ﬁnds also a simple, though appar-
ently very diﬀerent, explanation in the light-quantum
theory; it can be shown that the Doppler eﬀect may be
deduced from the conservation of energy and momen-
tum in the emission process.

Let us consider an atom A with two energy levels w1
and w2; the frequency emitted by the atom when it is
at rest is then

ν = (w2 − w1)/h.

Let us now suppose that the atom is excited and that
it moves with velocity V ; its total energy is then:

w2 +

1
2

m V 2.

At a given instant the atom emits, on jumping down to
the lower state, a quantum of frequency ν(cid:48); the recoil
of the emitted quantum produces a slight change of the
velocity, which after the emission becomes V (cid:48); the en-
2 m V (cid:48)2. We get therefore
ergy of the atom is then w1 + 1
from conservation of energy

The conservation of momentum gives:

m V (cid:48) = m V − h ν(cid:48)

where the bold face letters mean vectors. Taking the
square we get:

which is the classic formula for the Doppler eﬀect to a

If the atom is in an excited state with an excitation

cf. Eq. (3). According to Eq. (4), the energy can also
be expressed with the Lorentz factor γ as:
E∗ = γ m∗c2

0 = γ (m c2

0 + h ν) .

(9)

During de-excitation of the atom, a photon will be
emitted. For the sake of simplicity, only directions par-
allel or anti-parallel to an x axis will be considered.

4

Nevertheless two eﬀects have to be evaluated: the re-
coil on the emitting atom and the motion of System S,
in which atom A is now at rest, relative to the preferred
System Sp. The recoil can conveniently be calculated
by ﬁrst assuming v = 0, i.e., the system S coincides
with Sp and the photon emission is isotropic in both
systems.

Conservation of momentum and 3 energy in Sp re-

quires

p± = p∗ ∓ h ν±

and
E± = E∗ − h ν± .

(10)

(11)

Notations p+, h ν+ indicate a momentum or the prop-
agation of a photon in the positive x direction, respec-
tively, and p− and h ν− the reverse.

With the assumption v = 0, Eqs. (10) and (11) re-

duce to

p± = ∓ h ν±

c0

and
E± = m c2

0 + h ν − h ν± .

(12)

(13)

0 + (p±)2c2
0 .

Applying Eq. (2) to this case gives:
(E±)2 = m2 c4
(14)
Eliminating p± and E± with the help of Eqs. (12) and
(13) gives after a short calculation the recoil redshift
and the (trivial) result that it does not depend on the
direction of the emission in this case:
1 − 1

(cid:19)

where the approximation is valid for small h ν/(m c2

3Compare an important statement by Einstein (1917, pp. 127
und 128):
,,Bewirkt ein Strahlenb¨undel, daß ein von ihm getroﬀenes
Molek¨ul die Energiemenge h ν in Form von Strahlung durch
einen Elementarprozeß aufnimmt oder abgibt (Einstrahlung), so
wird stets der Impuls h ν
[...].
c
Aber im allgemeinen begn¨ugt man sich mit der Betrachtung
des E n e r g i e-Austausches, ohne den I m p u l s-Austausch zu
ber¨ucksichtigen.”
(If a light beam hits a molecule and leads to an absorption or
emission of the radiation energy h ν by an elementary process,
this will always be accompanied by a momentum transfer, [...].
However one usually only considers the e n e r g y exchange with-
out taking the m o m e n t u m exchange into account.)

auf das Molek¨ul ¨ubertragen,

In the general case with a relative speed v (cid:54)= 0 of
S with respect to the preferred System Sp, the photon
quantities thus derived are only formally valid in S and
have no direct physical signiﬁcance there, although the
excited atom A was at rest in S. The energy h ν± and
the momentum h ν±/c0 must be evaluated in Sp, in
which the propagation is assumed to occur.

Taking the square of Eq. (11) gives together with
Eq. (2) and the consideration that after the emission
the mass of the atom is again m to the relation:

(m∗)2c4

0 + (p∗)2c2

m2 c4

0 + (p±)2c2

0 =
0 − 2 E∗h ν± + (h ν±)2 .

(16)

The elimination of the momentum and energy terms
using Eqs. (7) to (10) leads after a lengthy calculation
to

ν (m c2

0 +

h ν
2

) = ν± E∗(1 ∓ β) ,

(17)

and ﬁnally to the result that the redshift depends on
the direction and the emission becomes anisotropic:

ν± = ν

m c2
m c2

0 + h ν/2
0 + h ν

γ (1 ± β) = ν±

0

1 ± β
1 ∓ β

,

(18)

where the deﬁnition of ν±
0 agrees with that in Eq. (15).
In what follows, we will generally neglect any recoil, for
instance, by employing the M¨oßbauer eﬀect (M¨ossbauer
1958) to obtain a very large eﬀective mass in Eqs. (15)
and (18). Eq. (18) then is equivalent to the relativis-
tic Doppler equation which Einstein (1905b, p. 902) de-
rived for the separation of a detector with constant
speed v = β c0 relative to an emitter:

ν− = ν

1 − β
1 + β

.

(19)

(cid:115)

(cid:115)

The Doppler eﬀect followed in Einstein’s treatment
from the application of the Lorentz transformations
(cf. Poincar´e 1905, p. 1505) to Lorentz’ electrodynamics
(Lorentz 1895, 1904), whereas Eq. (18) is a consequence
of the momentum and energy conservation.

The formulation of the detection of the photons with
frequencies ν± would have required a similar treatment,
but is simpliﬁed by assuming no recoil and ν = ν±
0 . If
the detector is together with the emitter at rest in S
and, therefore, also moving in Sp with v, the reverse of
Eq. (18) shows that the energy h ν will be absorbed:

parallel velocities u, v, w (Einstein 1905b, p. 906)

(21)

To show this, e.g., for positive velocities, we apply the
Doppler Eq. (18) ﬁrst with β1 = u/c0 and then with
β2 = v/c0:

dere K¨orper bewegt sein m¨ogen, stets r/(tB−tA) = c

(Let two points A and B with a separation r, at rest
in a coordinate system, be equipped with clocks. If the
clock at A indicates tA, when a light beam propagating
through the vacuum in the direction A B reaches point A,
and tB the reading of clock B, when the beam arrives
at B, then it should always be r/(tB − tA) = c, whatever
might be the movements of the emitting source or other
bodies.)

.

(22)

What is a clock? The next two statements suggest that
Einstein (1907) considered in most cases atomic clocks:

(cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:116) 1 +

β1 + β2
1 + β1 β2

(cid:115)

(cid:115)

(cid:115)

ν+ = ν

1 + β1
1 − β1

1 + β2
1 − β2

= ν

Consequently, we obtain ν+ from

ν+ = ν

1 + β3
1 − β3

(23)

(24)

with β3 calculated according to Eq. (21):

w
c0

= β3 =

β1 + β2
1 + β1 β2

.

The theorem thus also follows from energy and mo-
mentum conservation during the photon emission. The
derivation of Eq. (22) assumed that |β1| < 1 and
|β2| < 1. If either β| or β2 is approaching the limit 1,
β3 also goes to 1.

3 Clocks, transverse Doppler eﬀect and

aberration

In the previous section, we have postulated that the
preferred System Sp exists with an isotropic speed of
light in vacuum of c0 = ν λ, where ν and λ are the
frequency and wavelength of an electromagnetic wave.
This assumption is consistent with the more general
synchronization scheme of many clocks at rest in an
inertial system by Einstein (1908, p. 415/416) in order
to deﬁne a time required by physical applications:

,Sind A und B zwei relativ zum Koordinatensystem
ruhende, mit Uhren ausgestattete Punkte, deren En-
fernung r betr¨agt, und ist tA die Angabe der Uhr
in A, wenn ein durch das Vakuum in der Richtung
A B sich fortpﬂanzender Lichtstrahl den Punkt A
erreicht, tB die Angabe der Uhr in B beim Eintref-
fen des Lichtstrahles in B, so soll also, wie auch die

4Mermin (1984) argued that such a theorem can be proven with-
out involving light and that it would be consistent with an aether
at rest.

,In einer letztes Jahr erschienenen wichtigen Ar-
beit hat Hr.
J. Stark (1907) dargetan, daß die
bewegten positiven Ionen der Kanalstrahlen Lin-
ienspektra emittieren, indem er den Doppler-Eﬀekt
nachwies und messend verfolgte. Er stellte auch Un-
tersuchungen an in der Absicht, einen Eﬀekt zweiter
Ordnung [proportional (v/V )2] nachzuweisen und
zu messen; die nicht speziell f¨ur diesen Zweck ein-
gerichtete Versuchsanordnung gen¨ugte jedoch nicht
zur Erlangung eines sicheren Resultates.’
(In a paper, which appeared last year, Mr. J. Stark
(1907) demonstrated that the moving positive ions of
canal rays emit line spectra by conﬁrming and measur-
ing the Doppler eﬀect. He also performed investigations
with a view to ﬁnd and study a second-order eﬀect [pro-
portional to (v/V )2]; since the experimental setup was
not designed for this special purpose, a deﬁnite result
was not obtained.)

,Da der einer Spektrallinie entsprechende Schwin-
gungsvorgang wohl als ein intraatomischer Vorgang
zu betrachten ist, dessen Frequenz durch das Ion
allein bestimmt ist, so k¨onnen wir ein solches Ion
als eine Uhr von bestimmter Frequenzzahl ν0 anse-
hen.’ (Einstein 1908, p. 422)
(Since the oscillation process corresponding to a spectral
line has probably to be considered as an intra-atomic
process, the frequency of which is determined solely by
the ion, we can regard such an ion as a clock with a
certain frequency ν0.)

Ives and Stilwell (1938, 1941) later “established con-
clusively” that a moving atom radiates a frequency5 –
both for receding and approaching cases – of

ν+ = γ ν ,

(25)

5Actually Ives and Stilwell observed wavelength shifts and took
the longitudinal Doppler eﬀect into account, cf. Eq (18).

6

where ν is the frequency the atom emits at rest and
γ the Lorentz factor. This is known as the transverse
Doppler eﬀect.

The general aberration relation is

cos ϑ =

cos ϑ+ − β
1 − β cos ϑ+ ,

(26)

where ϑ+ is the angle of light propagation in an inertial
System Sp with respect to the direction of the motion
of an inertial system S, and ϑ the corresponding angle
in the moving system. It was also obtained by Einstein
(1908, p. 425) from the Lorentz transformations. Re-
solving Eq. (26) for cos ϑ+ gives the reverse aberration
formula:

cos ϑ+ =

cos ϑ + β
1 + β cos ϑ

.

(27)

For the special case of ϑ = 90o, i.e. cos ϑ = 0 it is
cos ϑ+ = β. It can easily be demonstrated that this fol-
lows from energy and momentum conservation as well.
Let an excited atom with large mass m (so that its
recoil can be neglected) and an excitation energy h ν
move with a velocity v in Sp. Assume a photon
emission perpendicular to v as seen from the moving
atom. Its energy is given by Eq. (9) and its momen-
tum by Eq. (8). The emitted photon has an energy of
∆E = E∗ − γ m c2
2 = γ h ν and, consequently, the mag-
nitude of its momentum vector is γ h ν/c0. The mo-
mentum of the atom changes parallel to the velocity by
β γ m c0 − p∗ = −β γ h ν/c0. Momentum conservation
thus requires a momentum component of the photon
parallel to v of β γ h ν/c0. This yields together with its
magnitude cos ϑ+ = (β γ h ν/c0)/(γ h ν/c0) = β.

4 Rods and the Lorentz contraction

Eddington (1923, p. 392) felt that

‘Size is determined by reference to material stan-
dards, and we must not imagine that there can be
any deﬁnition of size which dispenses with this ref-
erence to material objects.’

Nevertheless two alternative methods have been used
since: (1) The wavelength of crypton 86 from 1960 to
1983 and (2) the present method based on clocks and
the speed of light in vacuum (SI; BIPM 2006). Edding-
ton had, however, qualiﬁed his conclusion by adding:

‘No alternative method can be accepted unless it has
been proved to be equivalent to this.’

Lorentz said at the Pasadena conference in 1927
about the contraction hypothesis as an explanation

Fig. 1 In Panel a), an emitter (circle) is located at x0 = 0
0 = t0 = 0 in + or − di-
and radiates a photon at time t+
rection. They are detected by the detectors D− and D+
(rectangles) at x± = ±L = q λ, respectively, after travelling
a time T in the preferred system Sp – indicated by the vi-
olet shading. The number of wavelengths in L is denoted
by q. In Panels b) and c), the arrangement of emitter and
detectors is moving with a velocity v with respect to Sp
along the x-axis. Panel b) shows the situation at the emis-
sion of a photon (together with its propagation in Sp with
c0 = ν± λ±) Panel c) depicts the system at the time of pho-
ton detection t1 based on the Lorentz contraction on atomic
level.

of the Michelson–Morley experiment (Michelson et al.
1928, p. 551):

‘We are thus led to the ordinary theory of the exper-
iment, which would make us expect a displacement
of the fringes, the absence of which is accounted for
by the well-known contraction hypothesis (Lorentz
contraction).
Asked if I consider this contraction as a real one, I
should answer “yes.” It is as real as anything that
we can observe.’

A few years before this conference, von Laue (1921,
p. 92) remarked on the Lorentz contraction:

‘Setzen wir den K¨orper bei unver¨anderter Gestalt,
also bei der alten Lage der Atome [...], in Bewegung,
so k¨onnen sich diese Kr¨afte ebenso gut ver¨andern,
wie [...] die Kr¨afte zwischen den Ladungen. [...] Sind
sie elektromagnetischer Natur, so sagt ein von H.A.

i.e. with the old positions of the atoms, then is it pos-
sible that the forces could vary in the same way as the
forces between charges.

netic nature, a rule derived by H.A. Lorentz says that
the Lorentz contraction results.)

A rod of length 2 L aligned parallel to the x-axis of
an inertial system S with an emitter of photons with
an energy h ν in S at the centre and detectors at both
ends is ﬁrst assumed to be at rest in Sp in Fig. 1a). For
a propagation in both directions along the rod, we can
write with a certain number q
±L = ±c0 T = ±q λ = ±q

where T is the travel time equal in both directions with
±c0 in the preferred system. If this arrangement is now
moving along the x-axis with an (unknown) velocity v
relative to Sp, the number q of wavelengths can, at least
in principle, be counted and, therefore, cannot depend
on the state of motion.

In our conﬁguration, the longitudinal Doppler eﬀect
must be considered, cf. Eq. (18). As shown in Sect. 2,
the frequency shifts for the forward and backward di-
rections follow directly from the conservation of energy
and momentum of the emitted photons. We ﬁrst dis-
cuss the forward direction:

Fig. 2 As in Fig. 1, a rod of length 2 L is equipped with a
source emitting photons with energy h ν in the correspond-
ing rest frame of the emitter and two detectors at the ends.
In Panel a), the rod is at rest in the preferred System Sp –
indicated again by the violet shading.
In Panel b), as in
Fig. 1c), the emitter-detector frame S is now moving with
an unknown speed v (solid arrow) relative to Sp in the pos-
itive x direction. Detection of the photons will then occur
at x±(v) after times T ±(v) as seen from Sp, in which the
photon propagation is assumed to happen. In Panels c) to
f), the emitter and the detectors are, in addition, moving
relative to S with speeds of ±u1 and u2, respectively, which
±
1 and w2 relative
can directly be observed. Their speeds w
to Sp can then be calculated with the help of the addition
theorem, cf. Eq. (24). The detected energies are calculated
in the text.

Note that the photon travels after the emission in the
preferred System Sp with speed c0, while the rod in
the laboratory system S moves forward with v. The
question where the photon reaches the front end of the
moving rod can be answered with the help of the para-
dox “Achilles and the Tortoise” formulated by Zeno of
Elea. With β = v/c0 it will be at

We can now compare these ﬁndings with the results
of a formal application of the Lorentz transformations:
If the System S is moving with speed v in the positive
x-direction of System Sp and if both systems agree at
the time t0 = t+
0 = 0, i.e. the events [x0, t0] = [0, 0]
and [x+, t+] = [0, 0] coincide, then the inverse Lorentz
transformations relate all other events [x, t] to [x+, t+]
by

Both Eqs. (33) and (38) are, of course, in agreement
with LS/TS = c0. When comparing the lengths L+ and
L− in Eqs. (31) and (36), respectively, it is noteworthy
that they diﬀer in their absolute values. It is, however,
impossible that the uniform motion of the laboratory
system relative to the preferred system can lead to dif-
ferent lengths of the positive and negative rod sections.
A solution can be obtained by the observation displayed
in Fig. 1b) that the sum of the absolute values is

i.e., exactly the length of 2 LS resulting from Eqs. (32)
and (37). If we assume (in line with von Laue’s specula-
tion) that the atoms constituting the rod internally con-
tract and extend according to Eqs. (31) and (36), the
total length will change from 2 L at rest to 2 LS = 2 γ L
in motion. The photon emitter will be in the middle of
the rod, so that Eqs. (33) and (38) directly apply. At
time TS = γ T , cf. Eq. (25), the emitter will have moved
to v TS = v γ T and the detectors to γ (±L + v T ). This
situation is shown in Fig. 1c).

(cf. Lorentz 1895, 1904; Poincar´e 1900; Einstein 1905b;
Jackson 2001).

For our Systems S and Sp the following relations are

obtained:

1. Emission of photon:

2. Positions of detectors at photon emission:

[x0, t0] = [0, 0]
[x+, t+] = [0, 0]
[x1, t0] = [±L, 0]
[x±, t] = [±γ L, 0]
[x0, t1] = [±L, T ]
[x±, t±] = [γ (±L + v T ), γ (T ± v L/c2
0)]
4. Position of emitter at photon detection:

3. Positions of detectors at detection:

[x0, t1] = [0, T ]
[x+, t+] = [γ v T, γ β T ]

.

From Item 3 it follows

(41)

The conclusion can thus be drawn that Fig. 1 is in com-
plete agreement with the results obtained by applying
in a formal way the Lorentz transformations.

In Fig. 2 some conﬁgurations are compiled to demon-
strate the relativistic longitudinal Doppler eﬀect.
In-
ertial systems are assumed to move with velocities of
±u1 or u2, respectively, relative to System S (see open
arrows in Panels c to f). This system is at rest in a
putative aether system Sp in Panel a. The solid ar-
rows in Panels b) to f) indicate the unknown velocity v
with which the systems are moving with respect to the
aether, in addition to the velocities relative to S. In or-
der to limit the complexity of the mathematical opera-
tions, it will be assumed that all velocities are parallel
or anti-parallel. The total speeds w of the observational
systems in Panels c) to f) expected relative to Sp can
thus be obtained from |v| = v and ±|u1| = ±u1 or
|u2| = u2 with the help of the velocity addition theo-
1 = ±u1/c0 and β2 = u2/c0,
rem, cf. Eq. (24). With β±

In all Panels b) to f), the frequencies of the propa-

We have demonstrated with many examples that the
application of momentum and energy conservation dur-
ing the emission and absorption of photons together
with the assumption of an aether as preferred System Sp
gives exactly the same results obtained by formal ap-
plication of the Lorentz transformations. This answers
the ﬁrst question posed in Sect. 1 in the aﬃrmative.
The second problem, however, to determine the speed
of the laboratory system relative to the aether could not
yet be solved, because all relations could be formulated
without containing β = v/c0.

Even if we consider only the photon emission and
measure the recoil of the emitter as a function of v no
eﬀect will be observed. Using Eqs. (8) to (11), the prob-
lem can be described in terms of energy and momentum
equations:

,

(48)

γ (m c2

0 + h ν) = γ± m c2

0 + h ν± ,

and

A special application of Eq. (48) might be instructive
in showing that the addition theorem can also be used
to determine the total and kinetic energies of a massive
object relative to an observer. Let it move as emitter
in one direction with speed v1 relative to an inertial
system, while the observer and the detectors move in
the opposite direction with v2, cf. Fig. 2 f). Assume an
electron-positron annihilation at the emitter site with
an energy release in its rest frame of E = 2 me c2
0. The
energy absorbed by the detectors then is

Taking the square of Eq. (56) and setting
[1 + h ν/(m c2

∆β±. It can then, for instance, be applied to the emis-
sion of Lyman α by a hydrogen atom with the assump-
tions of v1 = 365 km s−1 – suggested by the asymme-
try of the cosmic background radiation Smoot et al.
(1991) – and twice this value v2 = 2 v1. In both cases
we get

∆β± = ± 1 − B

(58)

This has to be compared with the recoil speed of exactly
the same magnitude ∆β±(0) = ∓3.2573654 m s−1 to
show that β = v/c0 cannot be determined by this means
either.

5 Michelson–Morley experiment and the

aether concept

5.1 Operation in vacuum

In Fig. 3, the experimental setup in System S is shown
both at rest in the preferred System Sp with red opti-
cal elements and moving with a speed v = β c0 in the
positive x-direction with green optical elements. The
central beam splitter is shown twice at [x+
1 ] and at
[x+
3 ], when it is hit by the photon. Photons are ra-
diated by an emitter with energy E = h ν, but if the
emitter is moving with v, the photon energy in Sp is ac-

cording to Eq. (18) E+ = ν(cid:112)(1 + β)/(1 − β) (dotted

line). The receding mirror at x+
5 induces the inverse
Doppler eﬀect twice (cf. Wilhelm and Fr¨ohlich 2013)
leading to

γ h ν/c0. The momentum of the beam splitter changes
parallel to the velocity by −β γ h ν/c0. Momentum con-
servation thus requires a momentum component of the
photon parallel to v of β γ h ν/c0. This yields together
with its magnitude
cos ϑ+ = (β γ h ν/c0)/(γ h ν/c0) = β.

The beam splitter at x+

3 , advancing relative to the
propagation direction of the photon, will cause a cor-
responding Doppler eﬀect and aberration reﬂecting the
photon also with E = γ h ν to Detector D+. However,
only h ν will be absorbed, because the detector momen-
tum change β γ h ν/c0 in x-direction has to be provided
by the photon in addition to the fractional energy. With
cos ϑ+ = β, the photon with an energy of γ h ν/c0 just
fulﬁlls these requirements.

Special mention should be made on the lengths of
the inclined paths. The y-component is s = c0 T and
the x-component is v (t+

s+ =(cid:112)(c0 T )2 + (β γ c0 T )2 = γ c0 T

1 ) = β γ c0 T thus

2 − t+

(60)

is the geometric length in Sp. A consequence is that
from s = c0 T = q λ (cf. Fig. 1) it follows that
s+ = q γ λ, conﬁrming that the number q is not de-
pendent on the motion. Eq. (68) also shows that the
total length of the light path between the positions of
the beam splitter via the Mirror M+
y is equal to the to-
tal length via the Mirror M+
x , namely
5 − x+
2 γ L = (x+

Finally, it should be noted that the times in both sys-
tems are related by T + = γ T according to Eq. (40).

All relations in Fig. 3 have been derived by momen-
tum and energy conservation of the emitted, propagat-
ing and absorbed photons and optical elements. It is,
however, important to note that they could have been
obtained in the framework of STR with the Lorentz
transformations in Eq. (40). For the Systems S and Sp
in Fig. 3 the following relations result:

1. Emission of photon:

[x0, t0] = [0, 0]

3. Position of mirror M+

The beam splitter at x+

1 , receding relative to the
propagation direction of the photons, causes an inverse
Doppler eﬀect. The calculations at the end of Sect. 3
can be applied to this situation as follows: The photon
is deﬂected in S by 90o, but travels with E = γ h ν to
Mirror M+
y and Detector D+ (dashed lines) in Sp and,
consequently, the magnitude of its momentum vector is

photons with an energy of h ν in its rest frame), beam splitter, mirrors and detector, if the apparatus in System S is at
rest in Sp, as well as by green items moving relative to System Sp with a velocity v parallel to the x-coordinate axes. The
systems are assumed to coincide at t0 = t+

the photons occurs in System Sp. Their paths are indicated by solid lines if v = 0 and their energy is E = h ν. If v (cid:54)= 0,

5.2 Operation in air

Cahill and Kitto (2003) have claimed that the interfer-
ometer experiment of Michelson–Morley should give a
null result only if operated under vacuum conditions.
Brillet and Hall (2003) indeed obtained a null result in

vacuum. Historic experiments performed by Michelson
and Morley (1887) and Miller (1933), however, oper-
ated in air with an index of refraction at a wavelength
of λ = 570 nm of n ≈ 1.000 2774, which is only slightly
depending on the atmospheric pressure. They did, in
most cases, not produce exact null results.

In particular, Miller (1933) performed over decades
many experiments with folded optical paths as long
as 6406 cm, corresponding to a total
light-path of
112 000 000 λ. He found a maximum displacement

12

of 0.152 λ and converted it to an “ether drift” of
11.2 km/s. Can the observations accounted for by mea-
surement uncertainties as is generally done?
The propagation speed c of light in a transparent
body made out of a material with n (cid:54)= 1 moving with
the speed v relative to the observer was considered by
Fresnel (1818) and Fizeau (1851, 1860) with the result
that

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(61)

where (1− 1/n2) is the so-called Fresnel aether drag co-
eﬃcient, indicating a partial drag of the aether by the
moving body. Fizeau (1851), however, was not con-
vinced that these ﬁndings reﬂected the actual physical
process:

‘The success of the experiment seems to me to render
the adoption of Fresnel’s hypothesis necessary, or at
least the law which he found for the expression of
the alteration of the velocity of light by the eﬀect of
motion of a body; for although that law being found
true may be a very strong proof in favour of the hy-
pothesis of which it is only a consequence, perhaps
the conception of Fresnel may appear so extraordi-
nary, and in some respects so diﬃcult, to admit, that
other proofs and a profound examination on the part
of geometricians will still be necessary before adopt-
ing it as an expression of the real facts of the case.’
(cf. Comptes Rendus, Sept. 29, 1851)

More than 50 years later, von Laue (1907) found
that the light can be assumed to be completely carried
along by a body with n (cid:54)= 1, if the speeds c = c0/n and
v are combined according to the addition theorem of
velocities. For parallel velocities c and v, he obtained
from Eq. (21) a speed of

1/n. Since in our case the emitter, the beam splitter
and the air are moving together with speed v relative
to Sp, a photon will be radiated perpendicular to v
with energy h ν and momentum h ν/(n c0) under the
assumption of no recoil. From Eqs. (8) and (9) and

and other observations drift speeds of about 400 km/s.
We feel, however, that the velocity addition theorem
has to be applied in analyzing the Michelson–Morley

and ﬁnd that there is no delay. It therefore appears as
if Cahill’s and Kitto’s claim is not supported assuming
von Laue’s drag velocities.

6 Discussion and conclusion

An aether concept – required by GTR (Einstein 1924) –
is not inconsistent with STR, and allows us to interpret
the photon processes on the basis of momentum and
energy conservation. A determination of the speed of a
laboratory system relative to the aether does, however,
not seem to be possible, i.e., neither with operation in
vacuum nor in air.
