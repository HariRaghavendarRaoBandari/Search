We demonstrate the crossover from indirect- to direct band gap in tensile-strained germanium by
temperature-dependent photoluminescence. The samples are strained microbridges that enhance a
biaxial strain of 0.16% up to 3.6% uniaxial tensile strain. Cooling the bridges to 20 K increases the
uniaxial strain up to a maximum of 5.4%. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence reveals the
crossover to a fundamental direct band gap to occur between 4.0% and 4.5%. Our data are in good
agreement with new theoretical computations that predict a strong bowing of the band parameters
with strain.

On-chip data transmission is currently the bottleneck
to further increase computing power as metal wiring
reaches its fundamental limits concerning band width
and energy consumption [1]. Hence, optical intercon-
nects are envisioned to overcome the drawbacks of their
electrical counterpart. However, the realization of an ef-
ﬁcient light source compatible with the complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) environment is still
the greatest challenge for the convergence of electronics
and photonics on silicon. This is caused by the indirect
nature of silicon‘s band gap which prohibits eﬃcient light
emission. For monolithic integration of a light source on
Si it is, hence, desirable to have a material with a di-
rect band gap but - in contrast to direct gap III-V lasers
heterogeneously integrated on Si [2] - with chemical com-
patibility to Si. In this respect, Ge has gained a lot of
attention due to its CMOS compatibility and its small
conduction band oﬀset between the direct Γ and the in-
direct L states of only ∼ 140 meV. To close this oﬀset
and transform Ge into a direct band gap semiconductor,
the application of tensile strain [3–5] as well as alloy-
ing Ge with Sn [6–8] have become a very active ﬁeld of
research. The recent observation of lasing in a high Sn-
content partially strain-relaxed GeSn-alloy with a band
oﬀset of minus 25 meV (i.e. minimum of Γ-valley below
the energy of the L-valleys) delivered a proof of concept
for direct band gap group IV light emitters [6]. However,
lasing was so far limited to a maximum temperature of 90
K due to the rapidly decreasing non-radiative lifetime of
only a few hundred picoseconds at temperatures > 100 K
[6]. Direct band gap elemental Ge of high quality would,
in contrast, take full advantage from longer non-radiative
recombination times enabling lasing at elevated temper-
atures given that a similar conduction band oﬀset can be
achieved. However, in spite of the many eﬀorts to reach
a direct band gap conﬁguration in Ge by applying ten-

sile strain, there is still the lack of proving a fundamen-
tal direct band gap as spectroscopy on structures with
a suﬃciently high strain was either not presented [9] or
performed only at room temperature [4, 10], which is not
suﬃcient to substantiate the claim.

In this letter, we present Ge microstructures fabri-
cated from high-quality optical germanium-on-insulator
(GeOI) substrates where the material quality is assessed
by determination of the minority carrer lifetime. By mea-
suring temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL)
on structures with diﬀerent strain and at various ex-
citation intensities, we validate the transition from an
indirect- to a fundamental direct band gap semiconduc-
tor - which manifests in a strong direct gap emission at
20 K - to occur for Ge with a uniaxial strain between
4.0% and 4.5%.

To introduce a high tensile stress in Ge, we make use
of stress-enhancement by geometrical patterning as intro-
duced in ref. [3]. GeOI serves as the starting substrate.
It is obtained from a thick layer of intrinsic Ge grown on
Si which gets transferred to an oxidized Si wafer using
SmartCutTM technology [11]. After layer transfer, the
misﬁt dislocations originating from the defective Ge/Si
interface region are located on the top of the layer stack
and are, therefore, readily accessible and removed via
chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). After CMP, a 1
µm thick Ge layer of high quality is obtained on top of
a 1 µm buried oxide layer (see Fig. 1(a) and support-
ing material (SM) [12]). The bonding process preserves
most of the epitaxially induced strain which originates
from the diﬀerence in thermal expansion coeﬃcients be-
tween Si and Ge, leaving a biaxial tensile strain of 0.16%
at room temperature after layer transfer and CMP.

Patterning of the Ge layer into <100> oriented micro-
bridges is performed via electron beam lithography and
reactive ion etching to deﬁne a central, narrow constric-
tion symmetrically surrounded by pads with large cross
sections [3], see Fig. 1(b). When the underlying buried
oxide is selectively removed with vaporous hydroﬂuoric
acid, the pads relax which leads to a strong uniaxial ten-

sile stress in the constriction, as accurately reproduced by
ﬁnite-element COMSOL (FEM) modelling shown in Fig.
1(c). This geometrical enhancement of tensile strain can
be widely tuned by choosing appropriate ratios of width
and length for constriction and pads with the material‘s
yield strength as the limiting parameter [3].

The motivation to use GeOI as starting substrate lies
in the improved mechanical and optical properties com-
pared to Ge layers directly on Si: Due to the reduced den-
sity of threading dislocations and the absence of a defec-
tive Ge/Si interface, the yield strength increases and the
internal quantum eﬃciency of light emission rises thanks
to a longer non-radiative recombination time. We extract
the latter via infrared pump-probe transmission measure-
ments at the infrared beamline X01DC of the Swiss Light
Source using a 100 ps Nd:YAG laser pulse as excitation
and the broadband synchrotron radiation as probe [13].
In Fig. 2(a), transmission spectra through a GeOI sub-
strate are shown for varying delay times between pump-
and probe pulses. The high refractive index contrast be-
tween Ge and the buried oxide facilitates distinct Fabry-
Perot (FP) interferences. The peak positions shift with
a linear dependence on the optically excited charge car-
rier density Nc as ∆E/E is proportional to Nc/n2
rE2,
where nr is the refractive index [14]. From the spectra
shown in Fig. 2(a), the extracted charge carrier densities
(blue circles) are plotted together with the ﬁtted expo-
nential decay (red line) in Fig. 2(b). The non-radiative
lifetime τ as well as the Auger recombination coeﬃcient
γ, which relates the Auger recombination time τA to the
carrier density as τA = 1/γN 2
c , serve as free ﬁtting pa-
rameters, which are obtained as τ = 5.0 ns and γ =
5.0×10−31 cm6/s (for details see [12]). The latter value
is a factor 2 to 3 larger than compared to literature val-
ues obtained under low excitation [15] but is about one
order of magnitude lower than the Auger recombination
rate as obtained under carrier saturation conditions [16]
when probably also higher than second order Auger pro-
cesses begin to play a role. To decouple bulk- and sur-

face/interface eﬀects, the lifetime is measured on sam-
ples with diﬀerent thickness after thinning by reactive
ion etching using SF6, Ar and CHF3 (see Fig. 2(c)). The
thickness-dependent data are accurately described by

where τB is the bulk lifetime, d the layer thickness, S
the surface recombination velocity and D the diﬀusion
constant [17–19]. With D = 100 cm2/s [20], we obtain
S = 5500 cm/s and a bulk lifetime of τB = 12.0 ns. Ap-
parently, the dry etching does not aﬀect the surface re-
combination velocity which we attribute to a passivation
of the surface states with methyl groups [21].
Using the unthinned GeOI material, microbridges with
constrictions of 6 µm × 500 nm and varying pad lengths
are fabricated, yielding a maximum Raman shift of -6.7
cm−1 from power-dependent Raman spectroscopy [22].
According to the recently determined non-linear rela-
tion between Raman shift ∆ω and <100> uniaxial strain
given in ref. [23], this corresponds to a strain of 3.6% at
room temperature. By cooling the samples, this strain is
enhanced due to the diﬀerent thermal expansion coeﬃ-
cients of Si and Ge and the redistribution of the tensile
strain in the Ge layer by εL × EF , where EF is the en-
hancement factor given by the structure‘s geometry and
εL denotes the biaxial strain in the layer. Taking into
account the temperature-dependent thermal expansion
coeﬃcients of Si [24] and Ge [25], the biaxial strain in
the layer increases by 0.073% to a total of ∼ 0.24% when
going from 300 K down to 20 K. As shown in Fig. 3(a),
the strain in a given microbridge increases accordingly.
From the ﬁnite element modelling, it follows that e.g.
4.7% - which, according to deformation potential theory,
appears to be the crossover to a fundamental direct band
gap [26] - can already be obtained for bridge structures
with a room-temperature strain of 3.2% when cooling to

coeﬃcient between Si and Ge, the strain increases as the temperature is decreased. The red line shows that 3.2% strain at room

temperatures below 50 K as highlighted in Fig. 3(a).

Besides the increase in strain, lowering the tempera-
ture also thermalizes the electrons into the lowest en-
ergy states available in the conduction band. This ef-
fect will be exploited here to distinguish between fun-
damentally direct- and indirect band gap, as we have
recently done for the proof of a fundamental direct band
gap in GeSn [6].
In Fig. 3(b), the integrated sponta-
neous emission intensity for direct gap transitions is cal-
culated as a function of temperature for structures with
room-temperature (RT) strain values between 2.0% and
4.5% at a constant injected carrier density of 3 × 1018

cm−3. The model takes into account the T-dependent
strain increase from Fig. 3(a) with linear band shifts
according to deformation potential theory [26], as well
as the joint-density-of-states of the dipole-allowed tran-
sitions between the Γ-valley and the highest valence band
states, assuming isotropic, parabolic bands (see ref.
[6]
for details). Two regimes are found: (i) For ε < 3.0% at
RT, the direct gap crossover cannot be reached and the
electrons, hence, populate the indirect L-valleys, which
does not yield eﬃcient radiative recombination. (ii) For
ε > 3.0% at RT, however, cooling increases the popu-
lation of the Γ-valley such that the direct gap emission

intensity increases.

In Fig. 4(a), PL spectra of a microbridge with 3.6%
strain at 300 K are shown for varying temperatures. Car-
riers are optically excited by a continuous-wave laser
emitting at 532 nm with an incident power of 7 mW
on an approximately 7 µm spot corresponding to ∼ 18
kW/cm2. As expected from our model in Fig. 3(a), the
strain increases for lower temperatures, leading to a red-
shift in emission which overcompensates the typically ob-
served blue-shift of the band gap. To further corroborate
the validity of our temperature-dependent strain extrap-
olation, we extract the strain-dependent direct band gaps
Egap for a set of samples with diﬀerent strain by ﬁtting
the PL peak with a simple model for the spontaneous
radiative eﬃciency R(E) of a bulk material as

[28]), a = 4.774×10−4
Here, Egap (0) = 0.88 eV (ref.
1/K (ref. [29]) and b = 235 K (ref. [29]). The extrapo-
lation of strain values for low temperatures according to
FEM simulations seems conﬁrmed as the band gaps ex-
tracted from diﬀerent structures (i.e. with diﬀerent RT

strain) at the same strain state show an excellent agree-
ment (see Fig. 4(b)). It should be noted that even after
several cycles of cooling, the structures show no sign of
degradation and the same maximum strain is reached.
In Fig. 4(b), the experimental band gap energies at Γ
are compared to those calculated with the tight-binding
model and methodology of ref. [30] which was previously
applied for biaxially strained Ge. This model reproduces
ab initio calculations over a wide range of deformations
and predicts, in particular, a bowing of band gap en-
ergy at large uniaxial strain which is found to be in good
agreement with the experimental data.

Lastly, the intensities integrated over the PL peak are
plotted in Fig. 5(a) as a function of temperature for the
excitation density of 18 kW/cm2. When comparing in-
tensities between the diﬀerent samples at any given tem-
perature, higher strain yields higher emission intensity
due to a progressively more favorable alignment between
Γ- and L-valleys. When cooling from 300 K down to
200 K, we observe an intensity increase for all bridges
including the ones at strain below 3.0% albeit a mono-
tonic decrease would be expected according to Fig. 3(b).
We attribute this to the ambipolar carrier diﬀusion which
helps to collect a large amount of excited carriers from
the pad into the bridge region, in particular at lower tem-
peratures (we estimate a ∼ 10× larger carrier density to
be excited outside of the constriction compared to the
highly strained part, see [12]). This experimentally ob-
served eﬀect [3, 31] is not accounted for in the model.
In contrast, the faster carrier diﬀusion will lead to an
enhanced surface recombination velocity [32]. However,
this eﬀect seems to be overcompensated by the carrier

collection. At 150 K, direct gap emission from all sam-
ples can still be detected (see Fig. 5(b)), whereas for
lower temperatures the emission for bridges with ε <
2.7% at RT vanishes.

At 20 K, a strong direct gap emission is obtained from
samples with RT strain of 2.7%, 3.1% and 3.6% translat-
ing into 4.0%, 4.5% and 5.4% at 20 K (Fig. 5(c)). Un-
der a lower excitation density of 5 kW/cm2 which corre-
sponds to a steady-state carrier density of 4.6×1017 cm−3
at a lifetime of 5.0 ns and neglecting carrier diﬀusion, the
direct gap emission of the 4.5% and 5.4% strained bridges
can still be clearly detected, while the intensity at 4.0%
strain drops below the noise limit (see the shaded, ﬁlled
areas in Fig. 5(c)). Therefore, samples at 4.5% and 5.4%
are identiﬁed as having a fundamental direct band gap,
whereas 4.0% appears to be around the transition point.
The crossover of Ge towards a true direct band gap semi-
conductor is, hence, found between 4.0% and 4.5% uni-
axial strain, which is the main outcome of this letter.

The intensity decrease for direct gap samples when
cooling from 100 K to 20 K cannot be explained by above
introduced model that predicts a constant PL intensity
as a function of temperature in that temperature range.
We ascribe this to a lower eﬃciency for phonon-assisted
L→ Γ intervalley scattering (IVS) for electrons diﬀusing
from the outer pad regions (where the population is lo-
cated in the indirect valley) into the central constriction
(with its direct band gap), similar to experimental results
for temperature-dependent X→ Γ,L scattering times in
GaAs [33]. Due to the near-degeneracy of the Γ- and L-
valleys in the strained Ge, the IVS phonon bottleneck is
more pronounced than in GaAs, which explains that in

spite of the long non-radiative lifetime, the occupation of
Γ at low temperature does not seem to be in thermal equi-
librium with the one of the L valley. This phonon bottle-
neck will disappear when the Γ band edge is more than a
typical phonon energy (30 meV) below the L states. This
is exactly what we observe for the sample with the high-
est strain where we extrapolate that the band gap oﬀset is
approximately minus 40 meV with the decline being less
than a factor of 2. For this extrapolation, we assume the
crossover at 4.25 % and use a simple linear correlation,
i.e. the oﬀset value is 140 meV × (1 − 5.40/4.25) = -40
meV. An alternative explanation would attribute the be-
havior to a diﬀerent coeﬃcient in Varshni‘s law for Γ and
L states [27], as a weaker T-dependent energy decrease
for L than for Γ would have a similar eﬀect. However,
as the band gap variations vanish towards low tempera-
tures, the Varshni parameter-argument seems less likely
for a sound explanation of the observed eﬀect.

In summary, we have investigated strained germanium
microbridges fabricated from high-quality germanium-
on-insulator substrates with strain values around the
transition from indirect to fundamental direct band
gap. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence reveals
a qualitatively diﬀerent behavior depending on strain,
with a vanishing direct gap emission at low temperature
for ε < 4.0% and a strong direct gap emission for higher
strain. Therefore, the crossover of germanium towards an
elemental group IV semiconductor with a fundamental
direct band gap was evidenced at a strain between 4.0%
and 4.5%. Furthermore, we have shown long carrier life-
times in optical GeOI substrates and observed a phonon
bottleneck for thermalization of the carriers from the L-

into the Γ states. Finally, our data are in agreement with
a strong bowing of the band gap energy with strain as
predicted by theory.
In conclusion, long non-radiative
lifetimes together with high mechanical stability make
the newly developed GeOI substrate a most promising
platform to realize an eﬃcient direct band gap laser for
monolithic integration on a Si CMOS platform.

I. GERMANIUM-ON-INSULATOR FABRICATION PROCESS

The process steps for the fabrication of germanium-on-insulator (GeOI) are schematically shown in Fig. SM1. At
ﬁrst, 2.5 µm Ge is grown on 200 mm Si wafers via reduced-pressure chemical vapor deposition, followed by 200 nm
SiO2 via plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Subsequently, a defect layer is locally created in the Ge layer
by H+ ion implantation. Then, the wafer is bonded onto a silicon wafer which is covered with a thick thermal SiO2
layer. During the anneal of the bonded wafer stack, the pair splits at the defect layer created by ion implantation.
Finally, the surface of the Ge layer is treated by chemical mechanical polishing.

II. MODELLING OF CARRIER DECAY

From time-resolved synchrotron-based pump-probe transmission measurements, we extract the charge carrier den-
sity and ﬁt the decay with a simple model including a non-radiative decay time τ and a decay time τA related to
Auger processes. The decay of the charge carrier density Nc is described by the equation

where τA is expressed with the Auger recombination coeﬃcient γ as τA = 1/γN 2
c . After solving equation (1) for
Nc (t) and ﬁtting the model to the experimental data, we obtain the non-radiative recombination time τ and the
Auger coeﬃcient γ as 5.0 ns and 5.0×10−31 cm6/s, respectively. The robustness of the ﬁt towards changes in γ is
shown in Fig. SM2, where the decay model is plotted for three diﬀerent Auger coeﬃcients γ, revealing that the
coeﬃcient can be determined with an accuracy of < 1.0×10−31 cm6/s.

respectively.

III. ESTIMATION OF CARRIER DIFFUSION INTO CONSTRICTION CENTER

For temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements, it is found that the luminescence increases for all
structures upon cooling, although the calculated carrier population at the direct Γ valley for the samples with indirect
band gap (strain at 300 K smaller than approx. 3%, c.f. Fig. 3(b) in main text) decreases. We attribute this to the
fact that the model does not take into account the diﬀusion of carriers from regions in close vicinity of the highly
strained constriction into the center of the structure, which was previously shown to contribute to the intensity of the
emission at maximum strain [SM1]. The same carrier collection eﬀect has been acknowledged by Nam et al.
from
exploring so-called strain-induced pseudo-heterostructure nanowires [SM2].
For the here investigated structures, the area with a homogeneous distribution at maximum strain level is limited
to ∼ 4.5 µm × 500 nm (c.f. ﬁnite element COMSOL modelling shown in Fig. SM3(a)). The excitation spot, however,
extends over a larger area and is estimated to a width of 2σ ∼ 7 µm which means that most of the carriers are excited
outside of the region with the maximum strain. This is shown in Fig. SM3(b) where the area of excitation weighted
with a 2-dimensional symmetric Gaussian distribution is compared to the area of the homogeneously strained part of
the constriction. Depending on the collection eﬃciency, which itself depends on the temperature due to the increase
in mobility, additional carriers will ﬂow into the central region of the bridge where they recombine and thus enhance
the PL eﬃciency, as is observed in the experiment.

IV. STRAIN CONVERSION FROM RAMAN SHIFT

Commonly, strain is converted with a linear relation from Raman-shifts. For the case of uniaxial stress along

<100>, the strain ε is related to the Raman shift ∆ω as

ε = −∆ω/154 cm−1.

(SM2)

However, recent experiments correlating Raman spectroscopy with strain via Laue microdiﬀraction show that for

high uniaxial stress, there is a deviation from the linear relation [SM3].

As a comparison, the strain values of the investigated structures at 300 K and 20 K are given in table SMI for both,

the linear and the non-linear conversion.

N relative to carrier density N0 in function of excitation spot size. The increase in carrier density stems from the diﬀusion
of carriers into the strained constriction. The upper maximum of carrier increase is estimated by comparing the total excited
area weighted with a symmetric 2-dimensional Gaussian distribution to the central 4.5 µm × 500 nm area with homogeneous
strain.
