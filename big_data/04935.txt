LOWEST sl(2)-TYPES IN sl(n)-REPRESENTATIONS
WITH RESPECT TO A PRINCIPAL EMBEDDING

HASSAN LHOU AND JEB F. WILLENBRING

Abstract. Fix n ≥ 3. Let s be a principally embedded sl2-subalgebra in sln. A special case
of results in [WZ07] implies that there exists a positive integer b(n) such that for any ﬁnite
dimensional irreducible sln-representation, V , there exists an irreducible s-representation
embedding in V with dimension at most b(n). We prove that b(n) = n is the sharpest
possible bound.

The exposition involves an application of the Cartan–Helgason theorem, Pieri rules, Her-

mite reciprocity, and an application of the “branching algebra” introduced in [HTW08].

1. Introduction

For a positive integer n = d + 1, the complex irreducible representation of sl2 = sl2(C)
with dimension n will be denoted Fd. By deﬁnition, the action of sl2 on Fd deﬁnes a
homomorphism

π : sl2 → End(Fd).

Furthermore, upon ﬁxing an ordered basis for Fd we obtain an identiﬁcation End(Fd) ∼=
gln. The kernel of π is trivial since sl2 is a simple Lie algebra. The image of π, denoted s, is
therefore isomorphic to sl2. We will refer to s as a principal sl2-subalgebra of gln.

Once again we observe that s is simple, and therefore intersects the center of gln trivially.

Note that here we are require n > 1. Hence, s ⊆ sln.

The embeddings of sl2 into a Lie algebra is fundamental to representation theory.

In
general, a subalgebra l of a semisimple Lie algebra g is said to be a principal sl2-subalgebra if
l ∼= sl2 and it contains a regular nilpotent element of g ([Dyn52], [VGO90], [Kos59]). These
subalgebras are conjugate, so we sometimes speak of “the” principal sl2-subalgebra.

There is a beautiful connection between the principal sl2-subalgebra and the (co)homology
of the corresponding connected, simply connected, compact Lie group (see [Kos59] and the
exposition in [CM93]). One considers the decomposition of the adjoint representation when
restricted to a principal sl2. In the special case of sln, one obtains that the group of special
unitary matrices, SU(n), has the same homology as the product of spheres of dimension
3, 5, 7, · · · , 2n − 1.

In light of this fact, one considers decomposing representations other than the adjoint.
Even in the case of sln, this is a diﬃcult problem. Indeed, included in the representations of
sln are the symmetric powers of Fd. An “explicit“ decomposition was the subject of nine-
teenth century invariant theory of binary forms (see [How88]). In the case of the cubit and
quartic forms, there is a rich literature (see [vGW14] and the references therein). Put another

way, composing the principal embedding with an arbitrary ﬁnite dimensional representation
irreducible representation (irrep. for short) of sln:

sl2 ֒→ sln ֒→ End(V)

is an instance of plethysm. Decomposing V under sl2 explicitly is a subject ﬁlled with
unsolved problems.

Suppose, for example, that

V = V0 ⊕ V1 ⊕ V2 ⊕ V3 ⊕ · · ·

where Vj is the isotypic component of the sl2-irrep. Fj. We can ask, When is Vj 6= (0)
for an arbitrary ﬁnite dimensional irreducible representation ? For the “highest”, that is
max{j : Vj 6= (0)}, component this question is not diﬃcult since it is the restriction of the
highest weight of V to the Cartan subalgebra of sl2. However, the “lowest” component (i.e.
min{j : Vj 6= (0)}) is more complicated to determine.

This motivates

Theorem 1. Fix n ≥ 3, and a principal sl2-subalgebra, s, of sln. Let V denote an arbitrary
ﬁnite dimensional complex irreducible representation of sln. Then, there exists 0 ≤ d < n
such that upon restriction to s, V contains the s-irrep. Fd in the decomposition.

One source of motivation for this result is as follows. Let K is a reductive algebraic group
with a small subgroup S. By small (see [WZ07]) we mean that there exists an integer b
such that when an arbitrary irrep. of K is restricted to S there exists an S-irrep.
in the
decomposition with dimension at most b. If we assume that S is semisimple, then there are
only ﬁnitely many irreps. with dimension less than b. Thus, the dual of K may be partitioned
into equivalence classes in the same sense as done in [BGG76] for (K,S) a symmetric pair
corresponding to a split real group.

2. Notation and conventions

We record here standard assumptions and notation used in the paper. The ground ﬁeld
is, C, the complex numbers. Unless explicitly stated, all Lie algebras and representations
are assumed to be ﬁnite dimensional and over C.

If m is a positive integer and V is a vector space then we write

mV := V ⊕ V ⊕ · · · ⊕ V

m copies.

{z

|

}

If m = 0 then mV = (0). Thus, mV = V ⊗ Cm. Here (and throughout) we are tensoring
over the ground ﬁeld, C.

If G is a group (resp. Lie algebra), which acts on a vector space V , we will denote the
subspace of point-wise ﬁxed vectors (i.e. invariant vectors) by V G. If G acts on both V1 and

2

V2 then G acts on Hom(V1, V2) by g · T := gT g−1. The G-invariant vectors in Hom(V1, V2),
are exactly the G-equivariant homomorphisms, denoted HomG(V1, V2). We deﬁne:

multG(V1 : V2) := dim HomG(V1, V2).

(If G is understood, it will be omitted.) Note that in the case that V1 (resp. V2) is irreducible
and V2 (resp. V1) is completely reducible then mult(V1, V2) is the multiplicity of V1 (resp.
V2) in V2 (resp. V1).

Fix {Vλ : λ ∈ bG} to be distinct representatives of the equivalence classes of irreducible
representations of G, with index set bG. Then, for an arbitrary completely reducible G-

representation, V ,

V ∼=Mλ∈

bG

mλVλ

where the non-negative integers mλ are the multiplicities, that is mλ = mult(Vλ : V ).

If G is a subgroup of a larger group H, and V is an irreducible H-representation then V
GV . Then,

becomes a G-representation under the restricted action, which we denote by ResH
the numbers

multG(Vλ : ResH

GV ).

are sometimes called the branching multiplicities. An “explicit” description of these numbers
is called a branching rule (or law). The problem of describing these numbers is connected
to the topic of symmetry breaking in the physics literature.

2.1. Lie theoretic setup. Let k denote a rank r simple Lie algebra, and ﬁx a Cartan
subalgebra h. Denote the root system determined by (k, h) by Φ ⊂ h∗. For α ∈ Φ, let kα ⊆ k
denote the α root space.

Choose a set of positive roots Φ+ and set n+ be the sum of kα for positive α. The simple
roots in Φ+ will be denoted by Π = {α1, · · · , αr}. Let ω1, · · · , ωr be the fundamental weights.
The lattice of k-integral weights is then denoted P (k), while the cone of dominant k-integral

weights is P+(k) =Pr

Nωj where N = {0, 1, 2, 3, · · · } is the set of non-negative integers.
Set b = h ⊕ n+. For λ ∈ P+(k) let Lk(λ) denote the highest weight representation with

j=1

highest weight λ.

There exists a unique (up to isomorphism) simply connected algebraic group K with Lie
algebra k. Let TK denote the maximal algebraic torus in K with Lie algebra h and let UK
denote the maximal unipotent group with Lie algebra n+.

The irreducible ﬁnite dimensional representations of K×K are, up to equivalence, of the
form V1 ⊗ V2 where Vj is an irreducible representation of K (with the standard action of
K×K on tensors).

Let C[K] denote the coordinate ring of regular functions on K. The group K acts on itself
by left and right multiplication. Thus, C[K] is an inﬁnite dimensional representation of K×K
with respect to the action deﬁned by [(kl, kr) · f ](x) = f (k−1
l xkr). We have the (algebraic
version of the) Peter-Weyl decomposition:

C[K] ∼= Mλ∈P+(k)

LK(λ)∗ ⊗ LK(λ).

3

2.2. Small subalgebras. Let s denote a simple subalgebra of k. As we did for k, we ﬁx a
Cartan subalgebra for s, as well as a choice of positive roots. Let P+(s) denote the cone of
dominant s-integral weights. For µ ∈ P+(s), we denote the (irreducible ﬁnite dimensional)
highest weight s-representation by Ls(µ).

For λ ∈ P+(k) deﬁne

min

s

dim(λ) := min{dim Ls(µ) : µ ∈ P+(s) and mult(Ls(µ) : Lk(λ)) > 0}.

If the Lie algebra s is understood then we will simply write min dim(λ).

We wish to compute

b(k, s) := max
λ∈P+(k)

min

s

dim(λ)

provided a maximum exists. If no maximum exists then we write b(k, s) = ∞. In the former
case (b(k, s) < ∞) we say that s is small 1 in k. When s is small in k then we would like to
know a sharp bound.

2.3. A branching algebra. There exists a connected, Zariski closed, subgroup, S, of K with
Lie algebra s. Let TS (resp. US) denote the corresponding maximal torus (resp. unipotent
subgroup) in S.

We restrict the action of K × K on C[K] to S × K. That is, we restrict the left translation

by K to that of S. Deﬁne:

BK
S := C[K]US×UK.

For each of the groups S and K, the maximal torus normalizes the unipotent group. Thus,
TS × TK acts on these unipotent invariants.
In this light, we obtain a gradation by the
lattice cone P+(s) × P+(k). Indeed, B(S, K) consists of the highest weight vectors for the
S × K-action on C[K]. Let BK,λ

S,µ denote the TS × TK-eigenspace. We have

BK

S =M BK,λ

S,µ

where the sum is over (λ, µ) ∈ P+(s) × P+(k). This is an algebra gradation.

Proposition 2. Let λ1, λ2 ∈ P+(k) and µ1, µ2 ∈ P+(s). If for j = 1 and j = 2,

then

multS(LS(µj) : ResK

S LK(λj)) > 0,

multS(L(µ1 + µ2) : ResK

S L(λ1 + λ2)) > 0,

Proof. The dimension of the graded components of the branching algebra are equal to the
branching multiplicities. Since K is connected, the branching algebra is a subalgebra of the
integral domain C[K], and therefore has no zero divisors.
(cid:3)

It is worth pointing out that the proposition is particularly useful when we write µ2 = µ

and consider the special case µ2 = 0.

Corollary 3. For λ1, λ2 ∈ P+(k) and µ ∈ P+(s). Assume LK(λ2)S 6= (0). Then if LS(µ)
occurs in LK(λ1) as an S-representation, then LS(µ) occurs in

LK(λ1 + λ2), LK(λ1 + 2λ2), LK(λ1 + 3λ2),

· · ·

3. Binary forms

We now turn our attention to the case when k = sln for n ≥ 3 and s is a principally
embedded sl2-subalgebra. We order the fundamental weights ω1, · · · , ωn−1 so that the highest
weight of the irreducible representation ∧kCn is ωk.

Our goal of this article is to prove that

b(sln, s) = n.

It is clear that this number is at least n since L(ω1) ∼= Cn (the deﬁning representation of
sln), and upon restriction to s ∼= sl2 we have L(ω1) ∼= Fd with dim Fd = d + 1 = n. Recall
that Fd

∼= Sd(C2) (the degree d symmetric tensors on C2).

As a ﬁrst step, we consider the problem of computing mins dim(mω1) for d ≥ 1. As a
representation of sln, the space of degree m symmetric tensors, Sm(Cn), is equivalent to
L(mω1). Our question is therefore: What is the minimal dimension of an irreducible sl2-
representation occurring in the decomposition of

Sm[Sd(C2)] ∼= a1F1 ⊕ a2F2 ⊕ a3F3 ⊕ · · · .

Here aj is the multiplicity of Fj. We need to compute the lowest j with a positive multiplicity.
That is, deﬁne

ℓ(m, d) := min {j : aj > 0}

for non-negative m and d. Note that we use the letter ℓ as it is short from lowest sl2-type.

3.1. The sl2-character of a symmetric power. The representation, π : SL2 → GL(V )
has character

χV : SL2 →

C

g

7→ Traceπ(g).

Henceforth, we will let χV (q) denote the value of the character on the diagonal matrix

(cid:20) q
0 q−1 (cid:21). Furthermore, we let χd denote the character of V = Fd. Observe that from the

0

theory of sl2-representation we have

χd(q) = q−d + q−d+2 + · · · + qd−2 + qd.

Consequently, in the case that V = Sm[Sd(C2)], the character is the coeﬃcient of tm in the

Taylor series expansion of

1

(1 − tqd)(1 − tqd−2) · · · (1 − tq−d)

.

around t = 0. As is often done, we will denote this coeﬃcient (cid:0)m+d

q = 1 is the corresponding binomial coeﬃcient.

d (cid:1)q, since the value at

The problem of decomposing Sm[Sd(C2)] is equivalent to expanding

m (cid:19)q
(cid:18)m + d

= a1χ1 + a2χ2 + a3χ3 + · · ·

which for ﬁxed m and d can easily be done. Once the expansion is given, it is easy to obtain
minai>0 i.

A ﬁrst observation is that the above matrix is symmetric. An important tool for our

solution to this problem is the Hermite Reciprocity (see [GW09])

Theorem 4. As sl2-representations,

Sm[Sd(C2)] ∼= Sd[Sm(C2)]

for all m, d ∈ N.

Proof. The result follows from the fact that the two sides have the same character. That is,
for any non-negative m and d,

(cid:20) m + d

d

(cid:21)q

=(cid:20) d + m
m (cid:21)q

.

(cid:3)

Apart from Hermite reciprocity, there are many “obvious” aspects of this matrix.

Proposition 5. If both m and d are odd then ℓ(m, d) ≥ 1,

Proof. The weights of Sm[Sd(C)] are of the form

mdd + md−2(d − 2) + · · · + m−d(−d)

where md + · · · + m−d = m. Reduce modulo 2 to see that zero is not a weight when m and d
are both odd. If a non-zero sl2-invariant exists, then the zero weight space is non-trivial. (cid:3)

Also, the zeroth row (resp. column) is 0 since the symmetric powers of the trivial rep-
resentation, F0, are trivial. The next row (resp. column) is given by 0, 1, 2, 3, · · · since the
linear forms on Fd are precisely Fd.

The subsequent rows (resp. columns) corresponding to the symmetric tensors on Fd for
2 ≤ d ≤ 7 can be described using the branching algebra. That is, we compute an initial
segment of each row and then apply Corollary 3 once we ﬁnd an invariant. We proceed on
a case-by-case basis.

3.2. Quadratic forms.

Lemma 6. For any d ∈ N,

ℓ(2, d) =(cid:26) 0, d even;

2, d odd.

Proof. Row 2 (i.e. third from the top) consists of 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, · · · . The fact that the ﬁrst
three entries are 0, 1, 0 is a straightforward calculation. We then observe that S2k[S2(C2)]
contains an invariant for all k by taking powers of the invariant in the k = 1 case. Then,
multiplying each of these invariants by the highest weight vector in S1[S2(C2)]. Proposition
5 implies that there are only invariants degree 2k.
(cid:3)

3.3. Cubic forms.

Lemma 7. For any d ∈ N,

ℓ(3, d) =


0, d ≡ 0 mod 4;
2, d ≡ 2 mod 4;
3, d ≡ ±1 mod 4.

Proof. Row 3 (i.e. forth from the top) consists of the repeating pattern 0, 3, 2, 3. This fact
follows from the fact that S4[S3(C2)] has an invariant vector (a straightforward calculation).
Multiplying its powers by the highest weight vectors occurring in degree at most three yields
the repeated occurrence of F0, F3, F2, F3.
(cid:3)

We should note that it is well known that the full algebra of invariants on the cubic is
generated by the degree four invariant. Furthermore, the functions on the cubic are a free
module over the invariant subalgebra (see [GW09], Chapter 12). The fact that no lower Fd’s
appear other than the repeating patter 0, 3, 2, 3 is an immediate consequence of the story for
the cubic.

3.4. Quartic forms.

Lemma 8. ℓ(4, 1) = 4 and for all d 6= 1 we have ℓ(4, d) = 0.

Proof. Row 4 (i.e. ﬁfth from the top) has its ﬁrst four entries 0,4,0,0. This means that there
is an invariant in degree 2 and 3. Powers and products of these two invariants imply the
existence of invariants in degree d for d ≥ 2. Thus the remaining entries of the entire row
are all zero.
(cid:3)

Note that by Hermite reciprocity we have that S4(Sd(C2)) has an invariant for all d ≥ 0.
For each d ≥ 0 ﬁx a choice of non-zero invariant, f4(d). We will use these in the remaining
cases.

7

We should note that the invariant polynomials on the quartic form a polynomial ring
generated by two polynomials of degree 2 and 3. The full polynomial algebra is a free
module over the invariants – a consequence of Kostant-Rallis theory (see [GW09] Chapter
12).

3.5. Quintic forms.

Lemma 9. For odd d ≥ 5, ℓ(5, d) = 1, and ℓ(5, 1) = 5, ℓ(5, 3) = 3.

For even d ≥ 16, ℓ(5, d) = 0 and ℓ(5, 0) = ℓ(5, 4) = ℓ(5, 8) = ℓ(5, 12) = 0.
Lastly, ℓ(5, 2) = ℓ(5, 6) = ℓ(5, 10) = ℓ(5, 14) = 2.

Proof. Row 5 (sixth from the top) requires examining columns 0 through 18:

0, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0.

Since we know we have a degree four invariant, f4(5), for the quintic we can predict that
the ﬁnal 1, 0, 1, 0 will continue to repeat by multiplying by powers. Proposition 5 guarantees
that there are no invariants in the odd degree columns.
(cid:3)

3.6. Sextic forms.

Lemma 10. For d ≥ 14 or any even d, ℓ(6, d) = 0.

For d = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 we have ℓ(6, d) = 2. Lastly, ℓ(6, 1) = 6.

Proof. Row 6 (seventh from the top) requires examining columns 0 through 17:

0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0.

Since the last four entries are 0, we can infer that the remaining entries are 0 by multiplying
by f4(7).
(cid:3)

3.7. Septic forms.

Lemma 11. For odd d ≥ 5, ℓ(7, d) = 1. ℓ(7, 1) = 7. ℓ(7, 3) = 3. ℓ(7, 2) = ℓ(7, 6) =
ℓ(7, 10) = 2. For even d 6= 2, 6, 10, ℓ(7, d) = 0.

Proof. Row 7 (eighth from the top) requires examining columns 0 through 14:

0, 7, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0.

Since the last four entries are 1, 0, 1, 0 we can expect this pattern to repeat by multiplying by
f4(7) and observing that there are no invariants in odd degree (again my Proposition 5). (cid:3)

3.8. Forms of arbitrary degree. A ﬁnal observation is that most of the interior of the
table is ﬁlled with zeros and ones, which we prove now. With this in mind deﬁne:

E2 = {(5, 6), (5, 10), (5, 14), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 11), (6, 13), (7, 10)} .

We have

Proposition 12. The values of ℓ(d, m) are as follows.

• For all m ∈ N, ℓ(m, 0) = 0.
• For all m ∈ N, ℓ(m, 1) = m.
• For all m ∈ N,

ℓ(m, 2) =(cid:26) 0, m even;

2, m odd.

8

• For all m ∈ N,

ℓ(m, 3) =


0, m ≡ 0 mod 4;
2, m ≡ 2 mod 4;
3, m ≡ ±1 mod 4.

• For all m ∈ N, if m 6= 1 then ℓ(4, m) = 0; ℓ(4, 1) = 4.
• For all d ≥ m ≥ 5

ℓ(m, d) =


(m, d) ∈ E2;
(m, d) /∈ E and m ≡ d ≡ 1 mod 2;

2,
1,
0, otherwise.

Proof. For d, m = 0, 1 the result is trivial. For d, m = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 the result follows from
Lemmas 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and Hermite reciprocity. If d, m ≥ 8 then we revisit the table of
values for ℓ:

(cid:3)

From the point of view of proving our main theorem we need

Corollary 13. For all m, d ≥ 0, ℓ(m, d) ≤ min{m, d}.

That is to say, for any m and d, there exists an irreducible representation of sl2 with
dimension at most d + 1 occurring in Sm[Sd(C2)]. This completes our analysis of the lowest
sl2-types occurring in binary forms.

4. The proof of the general case

A principal sl2 subalgebra of sln is given by the image of sl2 in the n-dimensional irreducible
representation of sl2 (over C). For n ≥ 4 these are not maximal. Rather, for even n the
image is contained in the standard symplectic subalgebra of sln, while for odd n the image
is contained in the standard orthogonal subalgebra of sln. Because of this fact, it is natural
to approach the general situation the two cases (Sections 4.3 and 4.4) corresponding to the
parity of n. The argument is a fairly straightforward application of the Cartan-Helgason
theorem (Section 4.1) and the Pieri rules (Section 4.2) to reduce the situation to binary
forms. The latter have already been analyzed in Section 3.

4.1. The Cartan–Helgason theorem. Let (K,M) denote a symmetric pair. That is, M is
the ﬁxed point set of an algebraic group involution of K. Then the pair is spherical, which
means here that the aﬃne variety K/M has a multiplicity free coordinate ring. Put another
way, for any irreducible representation, V , of K, the dimension of the M-invariant subspace,
V M, is at most one dimensional. These results are part of the Cartan–Helgason theorem (see
[GW09]).

For our purposes, we consider two examples when K = SLn. First M = SOn. Although
the pair is symmetric for all n, we will only consider this example for n odd. For the second
case, we will let M = Spn, for n even. We have

Proposition 14. The pair (SLn, SOn) is symmetric and for λ ∈ P+(sln) we have

if and only if

dim L(λ)SOn = 1

λ ∈ 2Nω1 ⊕ 2Nω2 ⊕ 2Nω3 ⊕ · · · ⊕ 2Nωn−1.

That is, the Young diagram corresponding to λ has rows with an even number of boxes.

Proof. See [GW09] Chapter 12.

(cid:3)

Proposition 15. The pair (SLn, Spn) is symmetric and for λ ∈ P+(sln) we have

dim L(λ)Spn = 1

if and only if

λ ∈ Nω2 ⊕ Nω4 ⊕ Nω6 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Nωn−2.

That is, the Young diagram corresponding to λ has columns with an even number of boxes.

Proof. See [GW09] Chapter 12.

studied area of combinatorial representation theory. In the special case where one of the
tensor factors is a symmetric or exterior power of the deﬁning representation, the results
are particularly nice and will be used here. They are often referred to as Pieri rules in the
literature.

We choose the maximal torus for GLn to be the group of diagonal matrices with non-zero
entries, and ﬁx the Borel to be upper triangular matrices. On the corresponding Cartan
subalgebra, we let ǫi denote the linear functional


 7→ di.

ǫi :


. . .

dn

We will call these the standard coordinates.

Then, for a weakly decreasing n-tuple of non-negative integers (λ1 ≥ · · · ≥ λn), we let

λ := λ1ǫ1 + · · · + λnǫn ∈ P+(gln)

denote the corresponding dominant integral highest weight representation. Note that L(λ)
has polynomial matrix coeﬃcients. Each L(λ) restricts irreducibly to SLn. Furthermore,
each irrep. of SLn is the restriction of such an L(λ).

The n tuple for λ, in the standard coordinates, corresponds to a Young diagram whose
j-th row has λj boxes. We depict the rows of Young diagrams from top to bottom. So for
example, when n = 8, (7, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0) corresponds to

(4.1)

Denote the weight of the above diagram by λ.

Recall that the decomposition of L(µ) ⊗ Sd(Cn) into irreducibles is multiplicity free with
the λ occurring corresponding to Young diagrams obtained by adding d boxes to the Young
diagram of µ with no two in the same column. For example, when d = 5 the diagram in
(4.1) is obtained from (5, 5, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0) by adding ﬁve boxes:

(4.2)

X X X

X X

.

Thus, if we denote the weight of the diagram without the X’s by µ then we know that L(λ)
is one of the irreducible constituents of L(µ) ⊗ S5(C8), as an SL8 representation.

Recall that the symmetric powers of the deﬁning representation of symplectic group are
irreducible. Furthermore, it is worth noting that it is always possible to add or remove a
“horizontal strip” in this way so that the resulting diagram has even columns. A consequence
of this observation is

Proposition 16. Let n ≥ 2 be even. For any irreducible representation, L(µ), of SLn there
exists d such that

mult(Sd(Cn) : ResSLn
Spn

L(µ)) = 1.

11

Proof. For an irreducible SLn-representation L(µ) we have

HomSpn(L(µ), Sd(Cn)) ∼=(cid:2)Sd(Cn) ⊗ L(µ)∗(cid:3)Spn .

Although ﬁnite dimensional Spn-irreps. are self dual, this is not true for SLn-irreps. However,
without loss of generality we can replace the diagram for µ by the diagram for the dual. (The
Young diagram corresponding to L(µ)∗ is the complement of the diagram for µ inside the
µ1 × n-rectangle, but we do not need this fact.)

Using the Pieri rules we can explicitly decompose the tensor product. As previously noted,
by choosing d appropriately, we can add enough boxes to the Young diagram corresponding
to µ so that the resulting diagram has even columns. The result follows from Proposition
15.
(cid:3)

Next, recall that the decomposition of, L(ν) ⊗ ∧d(Cn) into irreducibles is multiplicity free
with the λ occurring if the corresponding Young diagram is obtained by adding d boxes to
the Young diagram of ν with no two in the same row. For example, when d = 3 the diagram
in (4.1) is obtained from (6,4,4,2,0,0,0,0) by adding three boxes:

X

X
X

(4.3)

If we denote the weight of the diagram without the X’s by ν then we know that L(λ) is

one of the irreducible constituents of L(ν) ⊗ ∧3(C8), as an SL8 representation.

It is worth noting that it is always possible to add or remove a “vertical strip” in this way

so that the resulting diagram has even rows.

Proposition 17. For any irreducible representation, L(ν), of SLn there exists k such that

mult(cid:0)∧k(Cn) : ResSLn

SOnL(ν)(cid:1) = 1.

Recall that the exterior powers of the deﬁning representation of the orthogonal group are
irreducible.

Proof. Mutatis-Mutandis from Proposition 16. Change the symplectic group to the (special)
orthogonal group. Change the evenness condition on columns to rows. Change symmetric
powers to exterior powers, and use the appropriate Pieri rule.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.1. The symmetric pair (SLn, SOn) corresponds to the split real form, GLn(R) and
therefore is a special case of [BGG76]. We thank Gregg Zuckerman for reminding us of this
reference.

4.3. The general case: even n. We reduce the problem for an arbitrary irrep. of sln to
the special case of binary forms. First, we have the chain of embeddings

sl2 ֒→ spn ֒→ sln.

Upon restriction to spn we apply Proposition 16 to prove the exists of an spn-irrep. of the
form Sm(Cn). We then observe that with respect to our principal sl2-subalgebra s we have
Cn ∼= Fd for n = d + 1. The result follows for even n from our analysis of the minimal
sl2-type in binary forms (Section 3).

12

4.4. The general case: odd n. Here, we reduce the problem for an arbitrary irrep. of sln
to the special case of exterior powers of sl2-irreps. First, we have the chain of embeddings

sl2 ֒→ son ֒→ sln.

Upon restriction to son we apply Proposition 17 for n odd to prove that there exists of an spn-
irrep. of the form ∧k(Cn). We then observe that with respect to our principal sl2-subalgebra
s we have Cn ∼= Fd for n = d + 1.

At this point we are faced with the problem of determining the lowest sl2-type in ∧kFd

4.4.1. The sl2-character of an exterior power. We have n = d + 1. It is an elementary fact

that dim ∧k[Sd(C2)] = (cid:0)d+1

k (cid:1), and we then recognize the above as dim Sk[S(d+1−k)(C2)]. In

fact, the q-binomial coeﬃcients are equal

k (cid:19)q
(cid:18)d + 1

=(cid:18)k + (d + 1 − k)

k

(cid:19)q

,

which implies

∧k(Fd) ∼= Sk[Sd+1−k(C2)].

From Section 3 we know that Sk[Sd+1−k(C2)] contains an sl2-irrep. Fj for some j ≤ d+1−k.

Since d + 1 − k ≤ d + 1 we are done.

5. A view from the theory of generalized Harish-Chandra modules

As was described in the introduction, one source of motivation for us is to generalize the
results of [BGG76]. There is another, related, point of view however. If G is a real reductive
group and H is an irreducible unitary representation of G, then there exists an underlying
admissible Harish-Chandra module, M, for the pair (g, K) where g is the complexiﬁed Lie
algebra of G and K is the complexiﬁcation of a maximal compact subgroup of G.

The question arises: Is M admissible for the pair (g, S) where S is small in K? If M
is inﬁnite dimensional then the answer is no. Thus, a construction of admissible general-
ized Harish-Chandra modules for (g, S) produces modules which are not admissible (g, K)-
modules.

This point of view was the original motivation of the authors in [WZ07]. See [PZ08] and
[PS10] for further developments along these lines. In [WZ07] a partial classiﬁcation of small
subalgebras was undertaken without paying attention to obtaining a sharp bound on the
dimension of a lowest s-type. It would be interesting to obtain bounds in general.

Beyond our methods, note that the geometry of the moment map can be used to approach

these questions, see [Web08].
