ON THE 2D MUSKAT PROBLEM WITH MONOTONE LARGE INITIAL

DATA

FAN DENG, ZHEN LEI, AND FANGHUA LIN

Abstract. We consider the evolution of two incompressible, immiscible ﬂuids with diﬀerent
densities in porus media, known as the Muskat problem [21] which in 2D is analogous to the
Hele-Shaw cell [26]. We establish, for a class of large and monotone initial data, the global
existence of weak solutions. The proof is based on a local well-posedness result for the initial
data with certain speciﬁc asymptotics at spatial inﬁnity and a new maximum principle for
the ﬁrst derivative of the graph function.

1. Introduction

The Muskat problem [5, 21, 26], mathematically analogous to the vertical Hele-Shaw model
in 2D case, describes the motion of two incompressible immiscible ﬂuids in porous media, has
attracted a great deal of attentions in recent years, see for examples [8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15].
In particular, [15] gave a very nice summary of earlier results as well as some most updated
progress on this problem. The interface between the two ﬂuids is a ”vortex sheet” [7, 18],
since the normal velocity is continuous while the tangential velocity is discontinuous. In the
Muskat problem, the ﬂuids motion are governed by the Darcy’s law. Under the assumption
that the gravity is the only body force acting on the ﬂuid, the momentum equation becomes
(in 2D case):

u = −

κ
µ

[∇p + (0, ρg)]

(1.1)

Here u is the velocity ﬁeld, ρ is the ﬂuid density, p is the pressure, µ is viscosity, g is the
acceleration due to gravity, and κ is the permeability.
Darcy’s Law may be viewed as a substitute for the momentum equation in the Navier-Stokes
system. In fact, it can be considered as a statistical average of the latter, see [21]. Naturally
there are 3D correspondences, but in this paper we only consider the 2D case, and the ﬂuids
are incompressible:

∇ · u = 0.

In addition, the conservation of mass gives

ρt + u · ∇ρ = 0.
The resulting system of (1.1), (1.2) and (1.3) is closed.

For the Muskat problem, we consider in this paper that

ρ(x, t) =(ρ1,

ρ2,

x ∈ Ω1(t),
x ∈ Ω2(t) = R2\Ω1(t).

(1.4)

ρ1, ρ2 are two diﬀerent constants correspond to two homogeneous ﬂuids. Often, the viscosity
of the two ﬂuids can be diﬀerent, where the Atwood Number Aµ is introduced and it is deﬁned
by

Aµ =

µ2 − µ1
µ1 + µ2

.

For the case Aµ 6= 0, we refer to [1, 25]. Sometime the surface tension is also considered, it
has a regularizing eﬀect [16]. We shall consider the case that Aµ = 0 and with no surface
tension. Then the system can be transformed into a contour dynamics system [10]

where f (x, t) is the function which gives a graphical representation of the interface. In the
3D case, the interface is a 2D (sheet or) surface in R3, while in 2D it is a curve in the plane.
Rayleigh [23] and Saﬀman-Taylor [26] gave a condition that must be satisﬁed for the linearized
model in order to ensure local well-posedness, namely the normal component of the pressure
gradient jump at the interface has to have a distinguished sign, known as the Rayleigh-Taylor
condition

− (∇p2(x, f (x), t) − ∇p1(x, f (x), t)) · n > 0,

where the normal vector of the curve (x, f (x)) is given by n = (−f′(x), 1)/
p1 + f′(x)2. Note that the incompressible condition implies, at the free interface, that

(u1 − u2) · n = 0 i.e.

[u] · n = 0.

(1.6)

(1.7)

Here p1, p2, u1 and u2 denote the limits approaching the interface. Using (1.6), (1.7) together
with the Darcy’s Law (1.1), we obtain

ρ1 < ρ2,

(1.8)

which is the Rayleigh-Taylor condition in our case. (1.8) can be seen also from the linearized
system, which will be explained it in Section 2.
Let us recall a few results closely related to this paper. Cordoba-Gancedo [10] derived the
contour dynamics system and proved its local well-posedness with H k , for k suitably large,
initial data. They also showed ill-posedness when R-T condition is not satisﬁed. In [11], they
gave a maximum principle satisﬁed by the graph function f (x, t) in various cases. Cordoba-
Feﬀerman-Gancedo [8] showed that in 2D a nonempty open set of initial data in H 4 develops
[13]
ﬁnite-time singularity when the R-T condition is violated. Recently, Constantin etc.
obtained the global existence for the exact small initial data in 2D satisfying kf0k1 ≤ 1
5 .

2

Among other things, this result was improved much further in their recent papers [14, 15]
to kf0k1 ≤ 1
3 . We remark that the norm k · k1 used in their paper is deﬁned by kfk1 =
R |ξ|| ˆf (ξ)|dξ, which is stronger than C 1-norm. They also proved the existence of global weak
solutions if the initial data satisﬁes that k∂xf0kL∞ is smaller than a given constant in both
2D and 3D. The compactness comes from their observation that k∂xfkL∞(R) < 1 in 2D and
k∂xfkL∞(R2) < 1
Motivated by [13], in this paper, we consider the 2D contour dynamics equation (derived in
[10]) with large initial data:

(1.9)

We assume that f0(x) is monotonically decreasing (the results of this paper also hold for
monotonically increasing initial data with a similar argument) and satisﬁes

with the asymptotics

kf0kL∞ < ∞,

k∂xf0kL∞ < ∞,

∂xf0(x) ≤ 0,

f0(x) → a, as x → −∞,
f0(x) → b, as x → ∞.

(a > b are two constants)

(1.10)

(1.11)

Remark 1.1. The restriction of monotone initial data here was inspired by the Nickel-
Matano-Henry zero number (or lap number) theory [17, 19, 22]. This theory is based on
the maximum principle (see e.g. [3, 19]), and it was employed to study the long-time behavior
of semilinear parabolic equations (cf. [2, 4, 20]). It tells us basically that solutions preserve the
monotone property if the initial data are monotone, i.e. the lap number does not increase, at
least for the 1D semilinear parabolic equation. And the equation considered here has a linear
(nonlocal) parabolic part (see Section 2), which suggests a nonlocal nonlinear parabolic nature
of the problem. We will discuss this further in Section 6. The zero number theory also suggest
us to explore the asymptotical behavior of our solution, which seems to be quite interesting
although we would not discuss it in this paper.
To explore the maximum principle for derivatives of graph functions, we adopted a similar
method as in [11] along with several new observations. One of the technical issue we need to
overcome is the fact that f (x, t) does not vanish at spatial inﬁnity (see Section 4 and 6).

With the Rayleigh-Taylor stability condition (1.8), we may assume the constant ρ2−ρ1
simplify some writings. Our main result is

2π = 1 to

Theorem 1.1. For given initial data satisfying (1.10) and (1.11), the contour dynamics
system (1.9) admits a global in time weak solution

∀ T > 0.
Moreover the solution is also monotone for all time in the spatial direction.

f (x, t) ∈ C([0, T ] × R) ∩ L∞([0, T ]; W 1,∞(R)),

˙W 1,∞(R) is the critical space for the graph function in equation (1.9) (see
We remark that
further discussions in Section 2). Because the integrodiﬀerential equation (1.9) has a strong
˙W 1,∞(R) of the
singularity, it generates a loss of derivatives in estimates, the boundness of
graph function is hence a key to establish global well-posedness theory for the contour dynam-
ics system (1.9). It should be noted that previous global results [13, 14] rely on a smallness
of the critical norm. In the present paper, we explored a new maximum principle which may
lead to estimates that exceed those from scaling invariants of the equation (1.9). Since this
maximum principle is valid for monotone initial data, we need to establish ﬁrst the following
local well-posedness theorem with given spatial asymptotics and with inﬁnite energy:

Theorem 1.2. For given initial data satisfying (3.1) and (3.2), there are a time T > 0 and
an unique solution

f (x, t) ∈ C([0, T ], C 2,γ(R) ∩ ˙H 3(R))

(1.12)

to the contour dynamics system (1.9).

Theorem 1.2 does not seem to follow from the results of [10]. The local well-posedness results
in [10] require initial data to be at least in energy spaces. If we cut-oﬀ the initial data such as
in [13], the regularized initial data would then not maintain the monotone property, which is
however crucial for our result. To obtain local solutions, we use an approximate approach as
in [13]. To start with, we add an artiﬁcial viscous term ”ε′f ε′
xx”. One soon realizes that such a
term can not overcome the possible derivative losses of the system (1.9). We then regularize
the nonlinear part via the method inspired by [13]. In the process of making priori estimates
for local solutions (in Section 4), we do not have the natural L2 bound as in [10] (We use the
homogeneous Sobolev spaces partly because of it), which is crucial in [10]. Instead, we using
the L∞ norm coming from the maximum principle for f (x, t).
Moreover, we show that the local solutions enjoy the same spatial asymptotics as the initial
data. The latter is possible because the integrodiﬀerential equation (1.9) have a special struc-
ture: the terms of (1.9) involve only the derivatives and the diﬀerences of the unknown func-
tion, in particular, constant functions are steady states. We therefore add some restrictions
to the standard H¨older Spaces such that the solution space becomes C j,γ(R) ∩ ˙H k(R)(k ≥ 2).
(The deﬁnition of the homogeneous Sobolev seminorm can be found below in Notations.)

The rests of this paper are organized as follows. In section 2 we recall some related properties
of the system (1.9). Then we propose an approximate scheme for (1.9) and prove its local
well-posedness in Section 3. In Section 4 and 5, we establish local well-posedness for the 2D
contour dynamics system (1.9). And ﬁnally, we show the existence of global weak solutions
in Section 6.

∆x−αf (x, t) = f (x)−f (α)
. We use | · | ˙C γ to denote the homogenous H¨older seminorm with the
index 0 < γ < 1: |f (·)| ˙C γ = supx6=y |f (x)−f (y)|
. And k · kC γ = k · kL∞ + | · | ˙C γ represents the

constant C0 > 1 and two positive quantities A and B.

As in [10], the contour dynamics equation(CDE) (1.9) can be linearized around the ﬂat solu-

where R denotes the standard Riesz operator [24]. Clearly, viewing from the linearized equa-
tions, the nonlinear system (1.9) is stable and well-posed if ρ1 < ρ2 and unstable if ρ1 > ρ2,
which can also be deduced from Rayleigh-Taylor Condition [23] [26]. Moreover, it is proved
in [10] that even for arbitrary small initial data in H s some solutions leave the space H s right
away in the unstable situation.
System (1.9) is invariant under the scaling

f (x, t) → f λ(x, t) = λ−1f (λx, λt).

One can verify that supt k∂xf (·, t)kL∞ and supt kξ ˆf (ξ, t)kL1 are invariant under the above
scaling transformation.

The same energy identity also holds for the 3D case [14]. Unfortunately, in (2.3), the second
term on the left-hand side does not provide a gain of a half derivative for ρ2 > ρ1 as it is in
the linear case. The energy identity in the latter case is given by

However, when the ﬁrst derivative of f (x, t) is small under the norm L∞, the Taylor expansion
of ln(1 + u2) would lead to a gain in estimates on derivatives, and consequently one obtains
a compactness. This is one of the keys in [13] [14] where they established global solutions

evolved from an exact class of small initial data. In our case, the compactness comes from a
new maximum principle in Section 6.

3. Approximate System for Constructing Local Solutions

In this section, we propose the approximate scheme for the 2D contour dynamics system (1.9)
and establish local well-posedness for this approximate system. This will be used to construct
local solutions to (1.9) in Section 4 and 5. We will focus on initial data (see Fig. 1.) which
has also spatial limits as x goes to inﬁnity

¯f0(x) → a as x → −∞,
¯f0(x) → b as x → ∞,

(a > b are two constants)

along with certain smoothness

¯f0(x) ∈ C 2,γ(R) ∩ ˙H 3(R).

Deﬁne the solution map in terms of the heat kernel for the system (3.3) as follows:

We now set up the problem so that we can use the standard contraction mapping theory. Let
B = L∞([0, T ]; C 2,γ (R)) be the Banach space. Let M > 0 be a constant. Let

equipped with the norm

E = {f ∈ B |

sup

0≤t≤T kf (·, t)kC2,γ ≤ 2M}

kfkE = sup

0≤t≤T kf (·, t)kC2,γ .

It is easy to see that E is a closed convex subset of the Banach space B. Then the local
well-posedness of the approximation system in (3.3) is stated in the following theorem:
Theorem 3.1. For any ﬁxed ε′ > 0 and given ¯f0 satisfying k ¯f0kE ≤ M , system (3.3) admits
(x, t) in B. Moreover, if additionally k ¯f0(·)k ˙H k ≤ M for some
an unique local solution f ε′
k ≥ 2, then the solution is also in C([0, T ], ˙H k(R)).

7

Remark 3.1. At the end of this section, we shall derive from Theorem 3.1 that the local
solutions have the same spatial asymptotics at inﬁnity as the initial data. That is to say, as
x goes to inﬁnity, f (x, t) goes to the same constants as ¯f0(x) for any t ∈ [0, T ]. The latter is
needed in the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Proof. Step 1. S maps E to E. We need to prove that kSfkE ≤ 2M . We proceed with ﬁrst

Collecting all the estimates, we have

kSfkE ≤ kfkE,

which means that S maps E to E.
Step 2. S is Contractive. We need to show that, there exists a 0 < λ < 1 such that for any
f, g ∈ E, there holds

kSf − SgkE ≤ λkf − gkE .

Similar to arguments in Step 1, the proof is also straightforward. For instance, for the term

By choosing T suﬃciently small, (3.17) follows.
Step 3.
with k ¯f0k ˙H k ≤ M , we then modify the deﬁnition of the closed subset E to be

We need to prove that S still maps E to E and S is contractive. The arguments are again
similar. For instance, we can estimate the part of the homogeneous derivatives as follows:

(cid:3)

Based on Theorem 3.1, we claim that the approximate solutions f (x, t) has the same spatial
asymptotics as the initial data ¯f0(x) at inﬁnity. In fact, integrate (3.3) in time and take limits
to ﬁnd that

(3.20)

The righthand-side terms in (3.20) involve only the derivatives of f (x, t), which vanish at
inﬁnity since f (x, t) belong to C 2,γ(R)∩ ˙H k(R)(k ≥ 2). Exchanging the limit and the integra-
tion (due to the uniform convergence of the integral), one can ﬁnd that the right-hand side
goes to zero.

4. Uniform a Priori Estimates of the Approximate Solutions

In this section we derive uniform estimates for the approximate solutions obtained in Section
3. More precisely, we have the following Lemma

Lemma 4.1. Let f ε′
(3.2). Then there is a positive T and for any 0 ≤ t ≤ T ,

(x, t) be a regular solution of the system (3.3) with initial condition (3.1)

kf ε′

kC2,γ (R)∩ ˙H 3(R)(t) . k ¯f0kC2,γ (R)∩ ˙H 3(R).

Proof. As before, we drop the superscript ε′ in f ε′
(x, t). The basic strategy of the proof is
as follows. We ﬁrst estimate the L∞ norm of solutions of the approximate system (3.3). To
get estimates in H¨older spaces, we will apply the energy method and the classical Sobolev
imbeddings. Since the (artiﬁcial) viscosity term and the regularization of the nonlinearity do
no eﬀect various estimates, we can get uniform in ε′ estimates and which can easily pass to
limits to get desired estimates for the original system (1.9).
Maximum Principle Here we show the maximum value of f (x, t) is bounded. A similar
argument holds for the minimum value. There are two possibilities:
(i) ¯f0(x) attains its maximum value which is larger than a in a ﬁnite x-interval
[−N, N ]. For this case, we follow the arguments in [11]. Let

M (t) = max

x

f (x, t).

12

Then M (t) is diﬀerentiable for almost every t. Suppose that f (x, t) attain its maximum value
which is larger than a, then, by the spatial asymptotics (3.1), there is xt (xt 6= ±∞) such that

f (xt, t) = max

x

f (x, t).

It follows that

As in [11], we have (for almost all t)

fx(xt, t) = 0,

fxx(xt, t) ≤ 0.

M′(t) = ft(xt, t).

Now we calculate the derivative of M (t)

M′(t) = ε′fxx(x)|x=xt + ∂xZR

= I1 + I2.

arctan (∆ε′

− (1 − ε′)ZR

α f (xt, t))2 dα.
1 + (∆ε′

Since xt is a maximum point, one gets fx(xt, t) = 0 and f (xt) − f (α) ≥ 0. Consequently, for
ε′ smaller than 1, one has also that I2 ≤ 0. Thus M′(t) ≤ 0 for almost every t ∈ [0, T ], which
gives M (t) ≤ M (0).
Next, we consider the second case: (ii) ¯f0(x) attains its maximum value a at inﬁnity. We
want to show the M (t) can not be larger than a. Indeed, if for some 0 < t < T , M (t) is larger
than a, then the arguments in case (i) applies, and we conclude that M (t) is decreasing at t.
This suﬃces to imply again M (t) is not larger than a as it is true for t = 0.
Analogously, we can get m(t) = minx f (x, t) ≥ m(0). Therefore, we obtain the maximum
principle for the L∞ norm

kfkL∞(R)(t) ≤ k ¯f0kL∞(R).

where we have used the classical Sobolev imbedding from Sobolev spaces to H¨older Spaces.
Combining (4.1), (4.3) and (4.10), we conclude that, there exist a time T , such that kf (·, t)kC2,γ (R)∩ ˙H 3(R)(0 <

(cid:3)

2 ) is uniformly bounded for all t ∈ [0, T ].

5. Convergence of Local solutions in H¨older Spaces

In this section, we are going to end the proof of Theorem 1.2 by establishing some compactness
results. From the a priori estimates in Section 4, we have the following uniform bounds in ε′

2 . One uses system (1.9) to derive the second bound in (5.1). In order to pass
to the limits ε′ → 0 for the approximate system (3.3), we need the following two elementary
facts:
Lemma 5.1. Let uk(x) be any bounded sequence in C 2,γ(R) ∩ ˙H 3(R)(0 < γ < 1
2 ) with the
uniform spatial asymptotics (3.1). Then uk(x) is strongly convergent in C 2,γ(R) up to a
subsequence.

(5.1)

Lemma 5.2. Let uk(x, t) be any uniformly bounded sequence satisfying (5.1) and with the uni-
form spatial asymptotics (3.1). Then uk(x, t) is strongly convergent in L∞([0, T ]; C 2,γ (R))(0 <
γ < 1
Remark 5.1. Theorem 1.2 is obviously a direct consequence of Lemma 5.2 by taking ε′ → 0
in the approximate system (3.3).

2 ) up to a subsequence.

It suﬃces to prove that uk(x) is compact in C γ(R), since the compactness
Proof. Lemma 5.1
in C 2,γ(R) follows from a standard interpolation argument. Let χR(x)(R > 0) be the standard
smooth cut-oﬀ function such that

χR(x) =(1,

For any integers k1, k2, one has

≤kuk1 − uk2kC γ (B2R) + kuk1 − uk2kC γ (Bc

Lemma 5.1 is proved if we show that the two terms in the last line of (5.2) can be arbitrarily
small provided R, k1 and k2 are large enough. For the second term in (5.2), we use the Sobolev
imbedding theorem to derive that

(5.3)

Noting that uk(x) have the asymptotics (3.1), and that uk(x) is uniformly bounded in
C 2,γ(R) ∩ ˙H 3(R), we know that the two terms in the last line of (5.3) tends to zero af-
ter taking R, k1 and k2 suﬃciently large. By the compact imbedding from C 2,γ(B2R) into
C γ(B2R), the ﬁrst term in (5.2) also converges to zero up to a subsequence.

As in the proof of Lemma 5.1, it suﬃces to prove the compactness in

(cid:3)

The following remark will be used in the proof of Lemma 6.1:

Remark 5.2. Notice that βx is a solution to the system (1.9) for any constant β. Using this
fact and similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 1.2, we can show that system (1.9) is
also locally well-posed for initial data of the form

f β(x, 0) = βx + f0(x),

(5.4)

where f0(x) is given in Theorem 1.2. Correspondingly, the local solution is given in the form

t (x, t) = ρ2−ρ1

f β(x, t) = βx + ef β(x, t), where ef β(x, t) satisﬁes
 ef β

ef β(x, 0) = f0(x),

1+(∆α

and

∂x∆α

ef β (x,t)+β)2 dα,

Moreover, the norm of ef β(x, t) in C([0, T ], C 2,γ(R)∩ ˙H 3(R)) is independent of β for all |β| < 1.
Here for simplicity, we can still denote ef β(x, t) by f (x, t).

6. Global Weak Solutions

In this section, we prove the existence of global weak solutions stated in Theorem 1.1. We
call f (x, t) a weak solution if it satisﬁes the system (1.9) in the sense of distribution

with A1 ≤ c1(ε) ≤ A2. A1, A2 > 0 are two constants (independent of ε) provided that ε is
suitably small. Initial data for the regularized system (6.2) is given by the molliﬁcation of
(1.10)

where Jε is a standard molliﬁer [18]. Note that the molliﬁed initial data f ε
decreasing since f0(x) is. Moreover, we have

0 (x) is monotonically

0 (x) → b as x → +∞ (b > a).

(6.5)

Again the (artiﬁcial) viscous term −εCΛ1−εf (x, t) in (6.2) will cause no trouble in deriving
those a priori estimates in Section 4, and from the previous discussion in Section 3 and 4
we know that for any ﬁxed ε the regularized system admits an unique local regular solution.
We remark that it is proved in [13] that the regularized system with H k(R)(k ≥ 3) initial
data admits global regular solutions. Although our initial data has inﬁnite energy, the spatial
asymptotics (1.11) enable us to utilize higher order energy estimates. One then can also
deduce an existence result for global regular solutions. We leave details to the readers.

Lemma 6.1. Let f ε(x, t) be a regular solution to the system (6.2). Then for any t > 0, there
holds

kf εkL∞(R)(t) ≤ kf0kL∞(R),

k∂xf εkL∞(R)(t) ≤ k∂xf0kL∞(R).

Proof. We drop the superscript ε and prove ﬁrst the maximum principle for ∂xf (x, t). Here
we only show the part of maximum value since the part of minimum value can be obtained by
a similar argument. From the spatial asymptotics (1.11) we know that ∂xf (x, t) → 0, as x →
±∞. Since the initial data f0(x) is monotonically decreasing, we need to show that f (x, t)
maintains the monotonic property, i.e. the maximum value of fx(x, t) cannot exceed 0. If
fx(x, t) attains its maximum value at inﬁnity for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T , there is nothing to prove.
Thus one suﬃces to examine those time t0 such that there exist a point xt0 (xt0 6= ±∞) such
that fx(x, t) attains its maximum value at (xt0, t0). Moreover, x = xt0 is a stationary point.
Denote

M (t) = max

x

fx(x, t).

Suppose that fx(x, t) attains its maximum value at xt(xt 6= ±∞), then it is clear that

Moreover, one has (for almost such t),

fxx(xt, t) = 0,

fxxx(xt, t) ≤ 0.

The evolution of M′(t) is govern by

M′(t) = fxt(xt, t).

M′(t) = fxt(xt, t) = −εCΛ1−εfx(xt) + εfxxx(xt) + Ix(xt),

Obviously, one has I11(xt) = 0. Moreover, one has

Without loss of generality, we assume that ∂xf (x, t) ≤ 0 holds at least for a short time

argument. Then we have

Therefore, one has

Therefore, one obtains

which means that

By the standard continuity induction argument, one has

fx(x, t) ≤ fx(xt, t) ≤ fx(x0, 0) ≤ 0.

fx(x, t) ≤ 0.

By the same method we can deduce that m(t) = minx fx(x, t) ≥ m(0), which means that the
minimum value also preserves. Thus we have

k∂xfkL∞(R)(t) ≤ k∂xf0kL∞(R).

Since f (x, t) is monotonically decreasing as the initial data, the L∞ maximum principle is
more or less trivial. One easily ﬁnds that b ≤ f (x, t) ≤ a. Thus the proof of Lemma 6.1 is
(cid:3)
completed.

Remark 6.1. If ∂xf (x, t) ≤ 0 does not hold for any short time interval [0, t0], then we

2 < 0 holds for a time interval I = [0, t2] for all

consider f β(x, t) = −βx + ef β(x, t) with 0 < β < 1. By Remark 5.5, it is clear that ef β(x, t)
is a solution to system (5.5) with initial data ef β(x, 0) = f0(x). Since ∂xf β
all x ∈ R, and ef β(x, t) ∈ C([0, T ], C 2,γ(R) ∩ ˙H 3(R)) uniformly in β ∈ (0, 1), by continuity
argument, we have that ∂xf β(x, t) ≤ − β
β ∈ (0, 1). On this interval, there are two possibilities:
(i) |xt| < ∞ on a short time interval [0, t2], where xt is the argmax of the function ∂xf β(x, t).
In this case, repeating the arguments in the proof of Lemma 6.1, it is clear that ∂xf β(x, t) ≤ −β
on [0, t2];
(ii) |xt| < ∞ on some time interval (t1, t2], 0 ≤ t1 ≤ t2, but |xt| → ∞ as t → t1+. In
this case, we know that ∂xf β(x, t) attains its maximum value at inﬁnity on [0, t1]. Therefore,
∂xf β(x, t) ≤ −β holds on [0, t1]. On the time interval (t1, t2], Repeating the above argument,
we can derive that M′β(t) ≤ 0, which gives

∂xf β(t2) ≤ ∂xf β(t),

∀ t1 < t < t2.

(6.6)

take t → t1+, we obtain that ∂xf β(x, t) ≤ −β also holds on [t1, t2]. Hence, we always have

∂xf β(x, t) = −β + ∂xef β(x, t) ≤ −β,

i.e. ∂xef β(x, t) ≤ 0 holds on a time interval I. Taking the limit β → 0, we have ∂xf (x, t) ≤ 0

holds on I.
