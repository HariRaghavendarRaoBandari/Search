We investigate nematic states in both bulk FeSe and FeSe thin ﬁlms. It is found that their band structures
and signature features that were observed in a variety of experiments can be perfectly explained by introducing
the d-wave nematic orders that are required to have contributions from all t2g d-orbitals, which contradicts the
conventional wisdom that the nematicity is simply driven by the orbital degeneracy between the dxz and dyz
orbitals. These orders can be generated by the Coulomb interaction between the nearest neighbor Fe sites. In
the presence of spin-orbital couplings, we predict that the nematic order can drive a topological quantum phase
transition through a band inversion at the M point of the Brillouin zone to produce topologically protected edge
states near the Fermi level. The prediction makes FeSe as a tunable system to integrate topological properties
into high temperature superconductivity to realize Majorana related physics.

The nematicity, which breaks rotational symmetries but
preserves translational symmetry of lattice, is one of the most
intriguing properties in iron based superconductors[1–4]. The
microscopic origin of the nematicity in these materials has
been debated intensively as the evidences supporting both
magnetic and orbital based mechanisms exist. Understanding
the nematic origin can also help to understand superconduct-
ing states[4].

The nematicity in the structurally simplest iron-based su-
perconductor FeSe is particularly interesting. The bulk FeSe
undergoes a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural phase tran-
sition at Ts ∼ 90 K and exhibits superconductivity at 8 K.
A signiﬁcant enhancement of Tc can be achieved under ex-
ternal pressure[5] or on monolayer FeSe grown on SrTiO3
surfaces[6–9]. The nematic order coexists with superconduc-
tivity but not with long-range magnetic order. The absence
of the long-range magnetic order has led to arguments that
the origin of the nematicity is not magnetically driven and is
most likely orbital-driven. For example, experimentally, in
NMR measurements, spin-lattice relaxation rate is found to be
not affected at nematic temperature, which favors an orbitally
driven nematic behavior in FeSe[10, 11].

However, recent theoretical calculations and experiments
show that the nematic states in the FeSe systems are far
more intriguing and complex[12–16]. There are very strong
high energy spin ﬂuctuations[16] which suggest that the ne-
maticity and magnetism may be still intimately linked.
It
was also found that there are many interesting features in
the band structures of the nematic state. In both bulk FeSe
and FeSe thin ﬁlms, the band splitting between dxz and dyz
bands at Γ is temperature-insensitive but the splitting at M
is closely related to the structural phase transition and can
reach 80 meV[17, 18]. The former could be attributed to
the spin-orbit coupling and the latter can be attributed to the
nematicity[17, 19, 20]. The Dirac cone type of band disper-
sions around M point was observed in FeSe thin ﬁlms thicker

than 1 Unit Cell [21, 22]. The corresponding Fermi surfaces
around M are four propeller-like electron pockets. These fea-
tures can not be fully explained by an onsite ferro-orbital and
a d-wave orbital ordering within dxz/yz orbitals[17]. Thus, it
is of great importance to ﬁgure out orders in nematic phase
that can consistently explain all these features. Such an un-
derstanding can shed light on the origin of nematicity and the
mechanism of superconductivity in FeSe.

Another interesting issue in FeSe systems is the existence of
possible nontrivial topology[24–26] . Theoretically, nontriv-
ial topology has been predicted in the Fe(Te,Se) systems in a
variety of circumstances, which suggests that FeSe can be in-
triguing systems to integrate topological physics together with
high Tc superconductivity. However, the topological proper-
ties in these predictions are untunable for given materials and
it is also unknown that how the nematicity can affect the topo-
logical properties.

In this paper, we investigate the nematic order in FeSe sys-
tems including both bulk FeSe and FeSe thin ﬁlms. We ﬁnd
that the band structures in ARPES experiments can be per-
fectly understood if the d-wave orbital orders emerge in all
t2g orbitals, namely dxz/yz and dxy orbitals. The order from
dxy orbital is even strongest. This result is sharply against
the conventional wisdom that the nematicity is driven by the
degeneracy between dxz and dyz orbitals. We show that the
Coulomb interactions between nearest neighbor sites can pro-
duce these d-wave orders. The Dirac cones around M point
mentioned above are attributed to all dxz/yz and dxy orbitals
and they exist in the normal state but are pushed up to near the
Fermi level in the nematic phase. Furthermore, we predict that
the nematicity can drive a topological phase transition through
a band inversion at M point. The strength of the nematic order
can be considered as an external tunable parameter to control
topological properties, which makes FeSe a tunable system to
integrate topological properties into high temperature super-
conductivity to realize Majorana related physics.

Tight binding model To investigate the nematic order, we
start from a tight binding model for the FeSe systems. For
monolayer FeSe, the band structure can be fully unfolded into
the Brillouin Zone of an Fe square lattice. The ﬁve-band tight
binding model in momentum space with respect to one Fe unit
cell can be written as,

ments of A(k) can be found in the supplementary material.
It is well known that there are some differences between the
bands from DFT and those in ARPES experiment for FeSe.
To best ﬁt the bands in experiment, we apply the renormal-
ization from interatomic Coulomb interaction and additional
shifts to hopping parameters. The ﬁnal band shown in Fig.1
can be classiﬁed into “k” band and “k + Q” band[25] and the
corresponding hopping parameters are given in supplemen-
tary material. Above Ts, the dxz/yz bands are slightly above
EF and the ﬂat dxy band locates at -50 meV at Γ point. The
dxz/yz bands are present at -40 meV and the dxy bands locate
at -80 meV at M point. All these features can be quantita-
tively compared with the bands measured in experiment for
mulitlayer or bulk FeSe[17, 20, 23].

Band structure in nematic phase We ﬁrst summarize the
important features in the band structure of the nematic states
observed in many ARPES experiments on the multilayer or
bulk FeSe. The most striking feature at Γ point is the split-
ting between dxz and dyz bands, which is nearly temperature
independent and persists above Tnem[17, 18]. It goes against
the ferro-orbital ordering and may be explained by spin-orbit
coupling in FeSe. Furthermore, the band splitting at M point
deceases with the increasing of temperature and ﬁnally van-
ishes at a certain temperature above TS. The bands at zone
corner are much more complicated compared with those at
Γ point. As the band splitting at M is attributed to the ne-
maticity, we focus on the bands around M. Two hole-like
bands at M, labelled as H1 and H2 respectively in red col-
ors shown in Fig.2(a), have been observed in all experiments.
A deep electron band crossing with the bottom H1 hole band
have been identiﬁed in both multilayer and bulk FeSe[20, 23].
A shallow electron band, which is very close to the Fermi
level (FL) and crosses with the top H2 hole band, has also
been observed[17, 23]. At low temperature, an electron band
slightly above the FL was observed and its band bottom is de-
generate with the band top of the H2 hole band[17, 23]. After
summarizing all the experimental facts, we conclude that there
are two hole bands and three electron bands around M point
in ARPES experiments in nematic phase, which is shown in
Fig.2(a). Moreover, the deep electron band intersects with the
top hole band near the FL, forming a Dirac cone[21, 22](the
green circles in Fig.2(a)). As the temperature increases, the
gap between shallow the E2 electron band (shown in Fig.2(a))

and the bottom H1 hole band decreases. A linear dispersion is
observed when the two bands ﬁnally touch each other[23].

An onsite orbital order for dxz/yz orbitals is clearly insuf-
ﬁcient to reproduce the observed results. Here, we will show
that the nematic orders that can be spontaneously generated
by the nearest neighbor (NN) interatomic Coulomb interac-
tion for ﬁve d orbitals[27, 28] can be sufﬁcient to explain ex-
perimental results. The NN interaction can be written as

is removed. This interaction can be decoupled into two kinds
of terms : (1) symmetry-preserving terms, which are correc-
tions to the DFT-based bands; (2) spontaneous symmetry-
breaking terms, which are nematic orders from this inter-
action. We focus on the symmetry-breaking terms as the
symmetry-preserving terms are generally absorbed to make
the band structures consistent with experiments. As only C4
rotational symmetry is broken in the nematic phase, we only
consider the terms that break C4 symmetry but preserve other
symmetries, such as glide-plane symmetry and C2 rotational

dyz orbitals.

Now we consider the consequences of the d-wave nematic
orders. The d-wave form factors in the nematic state have
several interesting consequences. First, they vanish at Γ point
but reach the maximum at M point. Second, their signs are
opposite between k and k + Q points. Namely, the nematic
orders have opposite signs between the “k” and “k+Q” bands.
Finally, in the band structure, as the couplings between dxz/yz
and dxy orbitals are speciﬁed between momentum k and k +
Q, the nematic orders at a speciﬁc k point are also effectively
opposite between dxz/yz and dxy orbitals.

These features create speciﬁc band structure reorganiza-
tions at M point in the nematic state as shown in Fig.3 in
the original 2-Fe unit cell. Fig.3(a) and (d) show the bands
and orbital characters along Γ − M direction without nematic
orders. At M point, the “k + Q” dxz electron band and “k”
dyz hole band are degenerate, so do the “k + Q” dxy hole
band and the “k” dxy electron band. If we consider an un-
detwinned nematic state with two nematic domains character-
ized by opposite nematic order parameters, in domain1 (D1)
with negative nematic order parameters, the “k + Q” dxz elec-
tron band shifts down but the “k + Q” dxy hole band shifts up.
Such movements make these two bands closer at M points
as shown in Fig.3. Simultaneously, the two ”k” bands move
away from each other. However, opposite behaviors appear
in the domain2 (D2): “k + Q” bands move away from each
other and the ”k” bands move closer. Fig.3(b) and (e) show
the band structure of two domains for the case of χA
1d = 3
meV and χA
4d = 6.5 meV. We ﬁnd that the ”k + Q” bands in
D1 touch each other with linear dispersion but the ”k” bands
in D2 touch quadratically. The former is attributed to the lin-
ear coupling between dxz and dxy orbitals and the latter is
attributed to the vanish of coupling between dyz and dxy or-
bitals along Γ − Mx direction. With the nematic order further
increasing, in D1 the two ”k” bands move away and the two
”k + Q” bands couple with each other away from M point,
opening a gap. With χA
4d = 18 meV,
the band structure of two domains are shown in Fig.3(c) and
(f). The band in Fig.3(c) agrees extremely well with that in
ARPES experiment shown in Fig.2(a). Furthermore, the E2
and H1 bands touch each other with linear dispersion as ne-
matic orders weaken, which is also consistent with experimen-
tal observations[23]. The two bands touching quadratically in
D2 has been not observed, which is likely attributed to the
matrix element effect in APRES measurements. We expect
them to be observed around My point as they belong to the
”k” bands.

are contributed from the dxz/yz and dxy orbitals. The small
hole pockets centering M is attributed to dxy orbitals. All
these Fermi surfaces are fully consistent with the experimen-
tal observations in the nematic phase[18, 21, 22]. Moreover,

We can get a self-consistent solution of the Hamiltonian and
obtain the symmetry-breaking order parameters as a function
of interatomic Coulomb interaction V , shown in Fig.2(b). We
ﬁnd that the intra-orbital nematic orders in the d-wave chan-
nels for dxz/yz and dxy orbitals establish from V ∼ 0.75 eV.
They are dominant over other nematic orders which are very
small with little effect on band structures. Their dominance
can be attributed to the fact that the Fermi level is close to
the van Hove singularity (vHS) contributed by dxz/yz and dxy
orbitals that can generate large quantum ﬂuctuations[28] (see
the supplementary material). We also notice in our calcula-
tions that the nematic order for dxy is even slightly stronger
than those of dxz/yz orbitals. This result is in sharp contrast
to previous studies in nematic phase, which suggest that the
nematicity is driven by the degeneracy between the dxz and

show the existence of the edge states to conﬁrm the existence
of nontrivial topology. The system is topologically nontrivial
if the nematicity-induced splitting is larger than the gap ∆N
M
between dxz/yz band and dxy band at M point in normal state.
In experiment, the splitting between two hole bands (H1, H2)
can reach 80 meV[17, 18] at low temperature, which is much
larger than ∆N
M ( less than 40 meV). Thus FeSe in nematic
phase is topologically nontrivial.

Discussion Our conclusion that the nematic orders are the
d-wave type of orders in all t2g orbitals have several important
consequences.

First, As we have discussed above, the d-wave nematic or-
ders offer a simple picture to explain the band structure ob-
served in experiments. The order parameters ∆1
M of dxz/yz
M of dxy orbitals, given in Fig.2(a), can be read
orbitals and ∆2
out from the band structures as the band splitting at M for
the two hole-like bands (H1,H2) and for the two electron-like
bands (E1,E2) respectively. The appearance of the Dirac cone
around M in the nematic state near the Fermi level stems from
the arising of the crossing point of dxz/yz and dxy bands by
nematic orders. This explains the experimental observation
that the Dirac cone is coexisted with nematicity and disap-
pears when nematicity is suppressed.

Second, as there are even stronger nematic order in dxy or-
bitals than in the dxz and dyz orbitals, the nematicity is not
simply caused by orbital degeneracy between dxz and dyz.
Furthermore, the d-wave orders are essentially bond orders on
the hopping parameters between d-orbitals, which are effec-
tively derived from the coupling to the p-orbitals of Se atoms.
As the coupling is also responsible for magnetic ﬂuctuations
in the materials, the results support that the nematicity and
magnetic ﬂuctuations are also strongly entangled. The ne-
matic order may be considered as the key competing order to
superconductivity. With increasing electron doping, nematic
orders are suppressed to enhance superconductivity. This is
consistent with the absence of nematicity and the appearance
strong superconductivity in heavily electron-doped monolayer
FeSe on SrTiO3[21].

Finally, the existence of the nematicity-induced topological
phase transition can help to realize topological physics, such
as Majorana modes. Because of nematicity-induced C4 sym-
metry breaking, the nematic orders are opposite for two do-
mains which can be an interesting system to study edge states.
These 1D nontrivial edge states are near the FL, as shown in
Fig.5 and can be detected by STM experiments[29, 30].

In conclusion, we ﬁnd that the nematic orders in FeSe sys-
tems are dominated by the d-wave nematic orders in all t2g
orbitals. The results can perfectly explain the band structures
observed in ARPES experiments in FeSe. The nematicity can
drive a topological phase transition through a band inversion
at M point to realize topological physics.

with the observed bands in experiment[21, 22], which further

Nematicity-driven topology In normal states, the “k” and
“k + Q” bands are degenerate at M point with opposite
parities[25]. In the nematic states, as the nematic order only
breaks the C4 rotational symmetry but not the inversion sym-
metry, the parities are still well-deﬁned while the degeneracy
is lifted. Increasing the nematic order, the “k + Q” dxz and
dxy bands with opposite parities can move close and eventu-
ally cross each other away at M to open a gap. This is a typ-
ical band-inversion process required for nontrivial topology
in topological insulators. If spin-orbital coupling is not taken
into account, we expect FeSe exhibit as a Dirac semimetal
when the nematicity pushes the Dirac cones near the FL. With
the spin-orbit coupling, the Dirac cones around M point are
gapped and the system is topologically nontrivial. Thus, the
strength of the nematic order, which can be tuned by applying
external pressure, can serve an adjustable parameter to drive
materials to have a topological phase transition. In Fig.5, we

MATRIX ELEMENTS OF HAMILTONIAN AND HOPPING PARAMETERS

The ﬁnal band structure with renormalization and additional shifts to hopping parameters is given in Fig.S1, where the blue
solid lines denote ”k” band and the red dashed lines denote the ”k+Q” band. The matrix elements of A(k) are in the following:

The corresponding hopping parameters are given in Table S1. The density of states is shown in Fig.S2, where the Fermi level is
close to the van Hove singularity contributed by dxz/yz and dxy orbitals.

NEAREST NEIGHBOR INTERACTION

According to eigenvalues of the glide-plane operation, the d orbitals can be classiﬁed into two groups: g1 (dxz, dyz) and g2
(dxy, dx2−y2, dz2). In the tight binding model, the intragroup orbitals couple with each other with the same momentum and the
