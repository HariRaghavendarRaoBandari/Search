Ensemble density-functional theory (eDFT) suﬀers from the “ghost-interaction” error when ap-
proximate exchange-correlation functionals are used. In this letter, we present a rigorous GI correc-
tion (GIC) in the context of multideterminantal range-separated eDFT. The method, which relies
on a double generalized adiabatic connection for ensembles, is equally applicable to standard Kohn-
Sham eDFT. We show that GIC reduces the curvature of approximate ensemble energies drastically
while providing considerably more accurate excitation energies, even for charge-transfer and double
excitations.

The low computational cost and good accuracy of time-
dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) [1, 2]
has made it one of the most popular method for cal-
culating electronic excitation energies. Nevertheless, it
still suﬀers from limitations like the poor description of
charge-transfer and Rydberg excitations, which are re-
lated to the wrong asymptotic behaviour of the exchange-
correlation potential [1]. In addition, excitations of mul-
tiple character [3] are completely absent from standard
TD-DFT spectra because of the adiabatic approxima-
tion. This letter deals with ensemble DFT (eDFT) [4–
7] which is a time-independent alternative to TD-DFT
for excited states. Its variational nature and hence the
ease of implementation have caused its recent reappear-
ance in the literature [8–16]. Originally formulated by
Theophilou for equiensembles [4], it was generalized by
Gross et al. [5–7] about three decades ago but till now
has not gained the status of a standard method. One
of the main reasons is the absence of reliable exchange-
correlation functionals for ensembles whose development
remains challenging [17–20]. Employing ground-state lo-
cal or semi-local functionals in practical calculations usu-
ally gives curved ensemble energies [21] and introduces
spurious ghost interaction errors [22]. The latter arise
in practical eDFT calculations when the Hartree energy
is calculated with an ensemble density (i.e. a weighted
sum of individual state densities). In spite of these dif-
ﬁculties, the ability of eDFT to account for multiple ex-
citations [21], in particular, motivates the recent devel-
opments in eDFT, including its multi-conﬁgurational ex-
tension [8, 9]. Very recently, Pernal and coworkers [8]
introduced range separation in eDFT. In their approach,
Boltzmann ensemble weights are deﬁned by means of
an eﬀective temperature parameter that can be tuned,
in addition to the range separation parameter. In con-
trast, Senjean et al. [21, 23] use a linear interpolation
method (LIM) in order to obtain weight-independent

Since LIM uses ensemble densi-
excitation energies.
ties in conjunction with ground-state Hartree-exchange-
correlation (Hxc) functionals, it necessarily suﬀers from
ghost-interaction errors. In Pernal’s scheme, the error is
pragmatically removed by deﬁning individual state ener-
gies [16]. So far, ghost interaction corrections (GIC) have
been developed in the context of single determinantal
Kohn-Sham (KS) eDFT [13, 22, 24] only. In this letter,
we present a rigorous strategy for removing ghost inter-
action errors in range-separated eDFT which, at the end,
proves to be equally applicable to standard KS-eDFT.

In eDFT, an ensemble consisting of M eigenstates
{Ψk}0≤k≤M−1 with energies E0, E1, . . . , EM−1 and the
associated weights w≡ (w0, w1, . . . , wM−1) is considered
k=0 wk = 1. Ac-
cording to the Gross–Oliveira–Kohn (GOK) variational
principle [5], the following inequality is fulﬁlled for any

with w0 ≥ w1 ≥ ··· ≥ wM−1 and (cid:80)M−1
trial density matrix ˆγw =(cid:80)M−1
Ew ≤ Tr[ˆγw ˆH],
where Ew = (cid:80)M−1
(cid:82) dr vne(r)ˆn(r) operators where ˆn(r) is the density oper-
ensemble density matrix ˆΓw =(cid:80)M−1

k=0 wkEk is the exact ensemble en-
ergy and Tr denotes the trace. The Hamiltonian ˆH =
ˆT + ˆWee + ˆVne is the sum of the kinetic energy, electron-
electron interaction and the local nuclear potential ˆVne =

ator. The lower bound in Eq. (1) is reached for the exact
k=0 wk|Ψk(cid:105)(cid:104)Ψk|. Due
to the GOK variational principle, the Hohenberg–Kohn
theorem can be extended to ensembles, leading to the
following exact ensemble energy expression,

Ew = min

Tr(cid:104)ˆγw( ˆT + ˆWee)(cid:105) is the analog of

where erf is the error function and µ is a parameter in

to Eq. (3), the ensemble LL functional can be range-

Note that ˆΓµ,w[n] is the density matrix of the long-range-

semble Hxc energy is usually split as follows [8, 9, 21],

Note that the standard Schr¨odinger and KS-eDFT equa-
tions are recovered from Eq. (9) for µ → +∞ and µ = 0,
respectively.
For the sake of simplicity, we will focus in the follow-
ing on two-state ensembles.
In this particular case,
one single weight w with 0 ≤ w ≤ 1/2 is needed and
w ≡ (1 − w, w), so that the exact ensemble energy reads
Ew = (1 − w)E0 + wE1. The description of more than
two states is discussed at the end of the letter. In recent
works, Senjean et al. [21, 23] pointed out that, in exact

2

theory, the excitation energy can be calculated in two dif-
ferent ways. The ﬁrst one consists in diﬀerentiating the
ensemble energy in Eq. (8) with respect to the ensemble
weight, thus leading to [21]

where ∆E µ,w is the auxiliary long-range-interacting ex-
citation energy and ∆µ,w
is the short-range xc derivative

discontinuity [9]. In the second approach, referred to as
LIM [21], the exact excitation energy is simply obtained
by linear interpolation,

ω = 2(cid:0)Ew=1/2 − Ew=0(cid:1) .

(11)

Let us stress that Eqs. (10) and (11) are equivalent if
exact functionals and wave functions are used, which is
of course not the case in practical calculations [21]. In
the standard weight-independent density functional ap-
proximation (WIDFA) [8, 21, 23], the ensemble energy in
Eq. (8) and the auxiliary wave functions in Eq. (9) are
calculated by substituting the short-range ensemble func-
tional with the (weight-independent) ground-state one
Esr,µ
Hxc[n], thus leading to the approximate WIDFA en-
semble density matrix,

or, alternatively, to

which is, by construction, weight-independent. The
“tilde” symbol indicates that the energies are calculated
within WIDFA. Although the combination of LIM with
WIDFA gave promising results [21, 23], the use of local or
semi-local ground-state short-range exchange functionals
inevitably introduces ghost-interaction errors [22] in the
equi-ensemble energy ˜Eµ,w=1/2. In Refs. [8, 16], this er-
ror is pragmatically removed by deﬁning individual state
energies from the individual densities. In this letter, we
propose a more rigorous approach that relies on an alter-
native decomposition of the exact short-range ensemble
xc energy [23]. For that purpose, let us consider the
following adiabatic connection (AC) path based on the
generalized AC formalism for ensembles (GACE) [28] and
the range-separated AC of Rebolini et al. [29]:

where the local potential ˆV µ,λ,ξ = (cid:82) dr vµ,λ,ξ(r) ˆn(r)
ensures that the density constraint Tr(cid:104)ˆΓµ,λ,ξ[n]ˆn(r)(cid:105) =

n(r) is fulﬁlled not only for all interaction strengths in the
range 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 but also for all ensemble weights in the
range 0 ≤ ξ ≤ w. Here we have introduced the ensem-
ble density matrix ˆΓµ,λ,ξ[n] = (1 − ξ)|Ψµ,λ,ξ
| +
ξ|Ψµ,λ,ξ
| which reduces to ˆΓµ,ξ[n] when λ = 0.
According to Eqs. (4) and (6), the short-range ensemble
xc energy can be expressed as

(19)

which is, as readily seen, free from ghost-interaction er-
rors. Note that, in the µ = 0 limit, the ensemble en-
ergy will be simply written as an ensemble Hartree-Fock
energy (calculated with the KS-eDFT orbitals) comple-
mented by the standard (full-range) ensemble density-
functional correlation energy. Note also that, unlike the
expression in Eq. (8), the one in Eq. (19) is not variational
with respect to the ensemble density matrix.
Ignoring
this leads to double counting problems [31]. Neverthe-
less, a variational expression can be obtained by using
an optimized eﬀective potential (OEP) [30], thus leading
to

So far, such a scheme has been implemented eﬃciently
only for approximate single-determinantal ground-state
wave functions but it can, in principle, be extended to
multi-conﬁgurational wave functions [31]. Here we pro-
pose a much simpler approach where a density-functional
potential is used rather than an OEP. Returning to the
exact calculation of the excitation energy, combining
Eq. (10) with Eq. (19) leads to

Note that the Hellmann–Feynman theorem does not hold
because of the non-variational character of the ensem-
ble energy expression. As a result, the response of both
ground- and excited-state wave functions to variations
in the ensemble weight is in principle needed.
In or-
der to perform practical calculations, we considered the
following approximations: (i) The long-range-interacting
density matrix is calculated in the framework of WIDFA
with the spin-independent short-range local density ap-
proximation of Toulouse et al. [26, 32]. (ii) We then use
the (weight-independent) ground-state local short-range
md correlation functional of Paziani et al. [33]. If, in ad-
dition, (iii) we neglect the response of both the ensemble
density and the individual wave functions to variations
in w, then the approximation (ii) has no impact on the
excitation energy which reduces to a ﬁrst-order corrected
(FOC) expression [29]:
FOC = (cid:104) ˜Ψµ,w

(cid:105). (23)
Note that the latter expression becomes exact only in
the µ → +∞ limit and it converges as µ−4 [29, 34].
Calculations have been performed with a development
version of the DALTON program package [35, 36] on a
small test set of atoms and molecules consisting of He, Be,
H2 (R = 1.4a0, 3.7a0) and HeH+(R = 8.0a0). The cor-
responding two-state singlet ensembles are {1 1S, 2 1S}
for He and Be, {1 1Σ+, 2 1Σ+} for the stretched HeH+
molecule and {1 1Σ+
g } for H2. (Long-range) wave
functions were optimized for a full conﬁguration interac-
tion (FCI) expansion in one-electron basis sets of aug-
mented quadruple-ζ quality (aug-cc-pVQZ) [37, 38]. Re-
sults are shown in Fig. 1 for µ = 0 (KS-eDFT) and
µ = 0.4a−1
0 . Although short-range correlation eﬀects
have been neglected in Eq. (23), following this approx-
imation improves the accuracy of the excitation energy
and reduces its weight-dependence signiﬁcantly in com-
parison to the WIDFA auxiliary excitation energy (see
Eq. (13)). In order to preserve the ghost-interaction cor-
rection while taking into account short-range correlation
eﬀects, it is in fact simpler to apply the LIM to the ensem-
ble energy expression of Eq. (19). Combining the latter

HeH+ and H2 molecules, respectively. It is also remark-
able that, in the KS-eDFT limit (µ = 0), GIC-LIM gives
relatively accurate excitation energies, also for the charge
transfer excitation. The double excitation is captured
but the excitation energy is still underestimated. In ad-
dition, we show in the supplementary material [39] that,
even though at very large µ values the FOC excitation
energy in Eq. (23) converges faster than GIC-LIM to-
wards FCI, it does not perform as well as GIC-LIM in
the range of standard values 0.4a−1
[8, 21],
which is due to the lack of short-range correlation eﬀects.
Following Savin [34], we ﬁnally propose to improve GIC-
LIM by means of extrapolation techniques. While the
LIM excitation energy varies as µ−2 when µ → +∞ [23],
the GIC-LIM one will vary as µ−3 [30], thus leading to

As illustrated in Fig. 2 for the charge transfer excitation
in HeH+, the WIDFA ensemble energy can exhibit a sig-
niﬁcant curvature in the ensemble weight which is essen-
tially removed in the GIC scheme, even at the KS-eDFT
limit (µ = 0). In this respect, combining GIC with LIM
is well justiﬁed. Let us stress that it is also much simpler
than the calculation of excitation energies through the
evaluation of ensemble energy derivatives. We also note
that the slope of the GIC ensemble energy is closer to FCI
and less µ-dependent. As shown in Fig. 3, GIC-LIM out-
performs LIM and converges much faster towards FCI,

As shown in Fig. 4 for He, when increasing µ from 0.2a−1
0 ,
GIC-ELIM converges monotonically towards FCI very
rapidly. Convergence is almost reached at the standard
µ = 1.0a−1
0 value [8]. This is very promising. Note that
all the approximate schemes discussed in the letter can
be extended to higher excited states simply by interpo-
lating linearly between equiensembles [21, 23].
