REGULARITY FOR FREE INTERFACE VARIATIONAL PROBLEMS

IN A GENERAL CLASS OF GRADIENTS

ADOLFO ARROYO-RABASA

ABSTRACT. We present a way to study a wide class of optimal design problems with a perimeter penalization.
More precisely, we address existence and regularity properties of saddle points to energies of the form

f u d x −ZW ∩A

s 1 A u· A u d x −ZW \A

s 2 A u· A u dx + Per(A;W ),

(u,A)

7→ ZW

where A is an operator of gradient form, u : W → Rd, A ⊂ RN is a Borel set, and s 1,s 2 are not necessarily

two well-ordered symmetric tensors. The class of operators of gradient form includes scalar- and vector-valued
gradients, symmetrized gradients, and higher order gradients. Therefore, our results may be applied to a wide
range of problems in elasticity, conductivity or plasticity models. In this context and under mild assumptions on
f , we prove for a solution (w,A), that the topological boundary of A is a C1-hypersurface up to a closed set of
H N−1-measure zero.

1. INTRODUCTION

The problem to ﬁnd optimal designs involving two materials goes back to the work of Hashin and Shtrik-
man. In [16], the authors derive optimal bounds for the effective moduli of composite materials . It was later
on, in the series of papers [17, 18, 19], that Kohn and Strang described the connection between composite
materials, the method of relaxation, and the homogenization theory developed by Murat and Tartar [24, 25].
In the context of homogenization, better designs tend to develop ﬁner and ﬁner geometries which result in
the creation of non-classical designs. A way to avoid the mathematical abstract of inﬁnitely ﬁne mixtures is
to add a cost on the interfacial energy. In this regard, there is a large amount of problems in optimal design
that involve an interfacial energy and a Dirichlet energy. The study of regularity properties of these problems
has been devoted, mostly, to problems where the Dirichlet energy is related to a scalar elliptic equation. See
[4, 21, 22, 20], where partial C1-regularity on the interface is shown for an optimization problem oriented to
ﬁnd dielectric materials of maximal conductivity.

We study regularity properties of similar problems in a rather general framework. Our results extend the
aforementioned results to similar optimization problems in linear elasticity and linear plate theory. Before
turning to a precise mathematical statement of the problem let us ﬁrst present the model in linear plate theory
that motivated our results.

compliance, i.e., the work done by the loading. The smaller the compliance, the stiffer the plate is. A
reasonable optimal design model consists in ﬁnding the most rigid design A under the aforementioned costs.
One seeks to minimize an energy of the form

Optimality conditions for a stiffest plate can be derived by taking local variations on the design. For such
analysis to be meaningful, one has to ensure ﬁrst that the variational equations of optimality have a suitable
meaning in the interface. For example, if one assumes that the interface ¶ A of a stiffest plate of design A is a
locally a C2-hypersurface, then one is able to show that D2uA has a trace from both sides of ¶ A. Furthermore,
one can derive the following optimality equation for D2uA on ¶ A,

s 2(D2uA)2(x)· (D2uA)2(x)− s 1(D2uA)1(x)· (D2uA)1(x) = HA(x)

for H N−1-a.e. x ∈ ¶ A.

Here, HA stands for the point-wise curvature of A and for i ∈ {1,2}, (D2uA)i stands for the trace of D2uA
from A when i = 1 and the trace from Ac when i = 2. In general the assumption that ¶ A is a C1-hypersurface
may not hold. Hence, it is natural to ask for the maximal possible regularity of ¶ A and D2uA.

We will introduce a more general setting where one can replace the second gradient D2 by an operator A
of gradient type (see Deﬁnition 2.3 and the subsequent examples in the next section for a precise description
of this class).

1.1. Statement of the problem. Let N ≥ 2 be a positive integer and let W ⊂ RN be a nonempty, open, and
bounded domain. We also ﬁx a function f ∈ L¥
; Rd). Let s 1 and s 2 be two positive deﬁnite, symmetric
tensors in Sym(Rd ⊗ Rd), with the following property: there exist positive constants 0 < a ≤ b such that

has a unique solution (cf. Theorem 1.1). We will refer to equation (2) as the state constraint and we will
denote by wA its unique solution. The dissipated energy

is a measure of the performance of A. It is a physically relevant question to ask which designs have the least
dissipated energy. To this end, consider the energy deﬁned as

ZW

f wA d x,

A 7→ E(A) :=ZW

f wA d x + Per(A;W ),

among Borel subsets A of W

.

We will be interested in the optimal design problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions on sets:

minimize

(cid:8)E(A) : A ⊂ RN is a Borel set, A∩ W

(3)
where A0 ⊂ RN is a set of locally ﬁnite perimeter. Most attention has been drawn to the case when designs
are mixtures of two well-ordered materials. The presentation given here, in contrast, places no comparability
hypotheses on s 1 and s 2. Instead, we introduce a weaker condition on the decay of generalized minimizers of
a double-well problem. Lastly, we would like to make two short remarks on the results presented in this paper.
The ﬁrst is that our technique also holds under various constraints other than Dirichlet boundary conditions.
In particular, any additional cost that scales as O(rN−1+e
), e.g., a constraint on the volume occupied by a
particular material [8]. And the second, is that models involving the maximization of dissipated energy can
also be treated with a similar technique to the one presented here.

1.2. Main results and background of the problem. Existence of a minimizer of (3) can be established by
standard methods. We are interested in proving that a solution pair (wA,A) enjoys better regularity properties
than the ones needed for existence. The notion of regularity for a set A will be understood as the local regu-
larity for ¶ A seen as a submanifold of RN whereas the notion of regularity for wA refers to its differentiability
and integrability properties. It can be seen from the energy, that the deviation from being a perimeter min-
imizer for a solution A of problem (3) is bounded by the dissipated energy. Therefore, one may not expect
better regularity properties for A than the ones for perimeter minimizers. Recall that, in general perimeter
minimizers are regular only up to singular set (cf. [10, 3]).

Since a constrained problem may be difﬁcult to treat. Instead, we will consider an equivalent variational

unconstrained problem by introducing a multiplier as follows. Consider the saddle point problem

(P)

where

IW (u,A) :=ZW

Our ﬁrst result shows the equivalence between problem (P) and the minimization problem (3) under the state
constraint (2). It relies in the direct method to guarantee existence of solutions to both problems. This allows
us to work with an unconstrained problem.

4

ADOLFO ARROYO-RABASA

Theorem 1.1. There exists a solution (w,A) of problem (P). Furthermore, there is a one to one correspon-
dence

between solutions to problem (P) and the minimization problem (3) under the state constraint (2).

(A,w) 7→ (A,wA)

We now turn to the question of regularity. Let us depict an outline of the key steps and results obtained in

this regard. The Morrey space L p,l

(W

; Rd) is the subspace of Lp(W

; Rd) for which the semi-norm

[u]p,l

:= sup(cid:26) 1

rl ZBr(x)|u|p d x : Br(x) ⊂ W (cid:27) ,

0 < l ≤ N,

s A A w· A w dx and the perimeter part Per(A;W ), and the perimeter scales as rN−1.

is ﬁnite. The exponent p = 2 and the scaling l = N− 1 are natural since we expect a kind of balance between
the Dirichlet partRW
The ﬁrst step consists in proving a critical L 2,N−1 local estimate for A w. To do so, let us recall a
related relaxed problem. As part of the assumptions on A there must exist a constant rank, ﬁrst-order
differential operator B : L2(cid:0)W
; Rn) with Ker(B) = Range(A ). It has been shown by Fonseca
and M¨uller [13], that a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the lower semi-continuity of integral energies
with superlinear growth under a constant rank differential constraint B v = 0 is the B-quasi-convexity of the
integrand. In this context, the B-free quasi-convex envelope of the double-well W (z) := min{s 1 z·z, s 2 z·z},
at a point z ∈ Rk, is given by

; Rk(cid:1) → L2 (W

QBW (z) := inf(cid:26)Z[0,1]N

W (z + v(y))dy : v ∈ C

(TN; Rk)∩ ker(B),Z[0,1]N

w(y)dy = 0(cid:27) .

The idea is to get an L 2,N−1 estimate by transferring the regularizing effects from generalized minimizers of

the energy v 7→RB1 W (A v) onto our original problem. In order to achieve this, we employ a G -convergence

argument with respect to a perturbation in the interfacial energy of I.

Theorem 1.2. Let (w,A) be a variational solution of problem (P) and let A be an operator of gradient form
(see Deﬁnition 2.3). Assume furthermore that all local minimizers ˜u of the functional

u 7→ZB1

QBW (A u) d x,

u ∈ Dom(A )

Remark 1. If s 1,s 2 are well-ordered, say s 2 ≥ s 1 is positive deﬁnite, then QBW is precisely the quadratic
form s 2 z·z. Due to elliptic regularity results (cf. Deﬁnition 2.3), QBW enjoys a higher integrability estimate

of the form (4). Therefore, the assumption (4) is indeed weaker than assuming the materials to be well-
ordered.
Remark 2. In dimensions N = 2,3 and restricted to the setting A = (cid:209)
, d = 1, and k = N, condition (4)
is strictly more general.
Indeed, one can argue by a Moser type iteration as in [9] to lift regularity for
minimizers. For higher gradients or the case of systems it is not yet clear to us whether assumption (4) is
equivalent to the well-ordering of the materials.

The second step, consists on proving a discrete monotonicity for the excess of the Dirichlet energy on

balls under a low perimeter density assumption. More precisely, on the function that assigns

r

7→

rN−1ZBr(x)| A w|2 d x,

x ∈ ¶ A, r > 0.

The discrete monotonicity, together with the upper bound estimate (5), will allow us to prove a local lower
bound l K on the density of the perimeter:

∀x ∈ (K ∩ ¶ A), 0 < r ≤ RK.

and a positive constant c = c(A ). Then, for every K ⊂⊂ W

∀x ∈ K,∀r ∈ (0,rK).

for some d ∈ [0,1),
there exist positive constants cK,rK such that

As usual, the lower bound on the density of the perimeter is the ﬁrst step to prove regularity of almost
perimeter minimizers. The next step is to prove a ﬂatness excess improvement. To do so, we follow more
and less the standard strategy. More precisely, a combination of arguments for minimal surfaces by Lin [21],
and arguments for the regularity theory of the Mumford-Shah functional, see [5, Ch. 8].

Theorem 1.3. Let (w,A) be a variational solution of problem (P) and let A be an operator of gradient type.
Under the assumptions of Theorem 1.2, the reduced boundary of A, ¶ ∗A, is a relatively open subset of ¶ A
with the following properties

H N−1(¶ A\ ¶ ∗A) = 0,

and ¶ ∗A is an open C1-hyper-surface.

Moreover, A w is essentially bounded in local neighborhoods of (¶ ∗A∩W ) where the trace of A w is deﬁned
from either side of ¶ ∗A.

Let us make a quick account of previous results. To our knowledge, only optimal design problems mod-
eling the maximal dissipation of energy have been treated. However, the theoretical approach of such prob-
lems is very similar. In [4] Ambrosio and Buttazzo considered the case where A is the gradient operator for

solutions and showed that, up to choosing a good representative, the topological boundary is the closure of

scalar-valued functions and where s 1 ≥ s 2 in the sense of quadratic forms. The authors proved existence of
the reduced boundary and H N−1(¶ A \ ¶ ∗A) = 0. Soon after, Lin [21], and Lin and Kohn [22] proved, in
the same case, that ¶ ∗A is an open C1-hypersurface. From this point on, there has been several contributions
aiming to discuss the optimal regularity of the interface. In this regard and in dimension N = 2, Larsen
[20] proved that connected components of A are C1 away from the boundary. Unfortunately, his argument
leaves open the difﬁcult task to prove that connected components of Ac are smooth. In arbitrary dimensions,
Larsen’s argument cannot be further generalized because it relies on the fact that convexity and positive cur-
vature are equivalent in dimension N = 2. During the time this project was developed, Fusco and Julin [14]
found a different proof for the same results stated in [21]. Their proof does not rely in the properties of the
Laplace operator for scalar-valued functions.

The paper is organized as follows. In the beginning of Section 2 we ﬁx notation and discuss some facts of
linear operators, Young measures and sets of ﬁnite perimeter. We also give the precisely deﬁnition of gradient
type operators and include a compensated compactness result that will be employed throughout the paper. In
Section 3 we show in Theorem 1.1 the equivalence of the constrained problem (2)-(3) and the unconstrained
problem (P). In the ﬁrst part of Section 4 we shortly discuss how the higher integrability assumption (4) holds
for various operators of gradient form. The rest of the section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.2 and the
upper bound (5). Section 5 is devoted to the lower bound estimate (LB). Finally, in Section 6 we show the
ﬂatness excess improvement. From this, Theorem 1.3 easily follows.

2. NOTATION AND PRELIMINARIES

Throughout this manuscript N ≥ 2 and d,k,l will denote Euclidean dimensions. We will write W

to
represent a non-empty, open and bounded subset of RN. We will reserve the use of capital letters A,B, . . . , to
denote Borel subsets of RN and we will write B(W ) to denote the Borel s -algebra in W
. The letters x,y,z will
denote points in Euclidean space, and the greek letters e ,d ,r and g will be reserved for general smallness
or scaling constants. We follow Lin’s convention on important constants in [21]: bounding constants will
be generally denoted by c1 ≥ c2 ≥ . . . , while smallness and decay constants will be usually denoted by
e 1 ≥ e 2 ≥ . . . , and q 1 ≥ q 2 ≥ . . . , respectively.
It will often be useful to write a point x ∈ Rd+1 = Rd × R as x = (x′,xd), in the same fashion we will
′,¶ d) to decompose the gradient operator. The bilinear form Rd × Rd → R : (x,y) 7→ x· y
also write (cid:209) = ((cid:209)
will stand for the standard inner product between two points while we will use the notation |x| := √x· x to
represent the standard d-dimensional Euclidean norm. To denote open balls centered at a point x with radius
r we will simply write Br(x). Similarly, we will write Cr(x) to denote the set of points {x ∈ Rd : |x′| ≤ r,|xn| ≤
1}.
We keep the standard notation for Lp and W l,p spaces: the space of p-integrable functions in W with
values in Z will be denoted by Lp(W
;Z) of p-integrable l-th
derivatives. Analogously, we write Cl(W
;Z) to denote the spaces of functions with continuous

;Z) and similarly for the Sobolev space W l,p(W

;Z), the space of bounded Radon measures in W

l-th derivative and its subspace of functions with compact support respectively. The same notation stands
for M (W
and values in Z. For X and Y Banach spaces, the
standard pairing between X and Y will be denoted by h·,·i : X ×Y → R : (u,v) 7→ hu,vi.
2.1. Unbounded linear operators. We gather some facts from the theory linear operators. A reference for
the following deﬁnitions and results can be found in [7, Chapter 2].

Let X and Y be Banach spaces. An unbounded linear operator is a linear map A : Dom(A ) ⊂ X → Y
where Dom(A ) is a linear subspace of X commonly known as the domain of A . Other important spaces are
the graph of A , G(A ) = {(u, A u) : u ∈ Dom(A )}; the image of A , Im(A ) = {A u : u ∈ Dom(A )}; and
the kernel of A , ker(A ) = {u : A u = 0 ∈ Dom(A )}. One says that A is a closed operator if and only if
G(A ) is closed in X ×Y .
Proposition 2.1. Let A : Dom(A ) ⊂ X → Y be an unbounded linear operator and assume furthermore that
Dom(A ) is dense in X. Then, there exists an unbounded linear operator A ∗ : Dom(A ∗) ⊂ Y ′ → X′, called
the adjoint of A , with

Moreover, A ∗ is such that

Dom(A ∗) =(cid:8)y′ ∈ Y ′ : ∃ c ≥ 0 such that |hy′, A xi| ≤ ckxk ∀x ∈ Dom(A )(cid:9) .

hy′, A xi = hA ∗ y′,xi

∀x ∈ Dom(A ),∀y′ ∈ Dom(A ∗).

Proposition 2.2. Let A : Dom(A ) ⊂ X → Y be a closed unbounded linear operator with Dom(A ) = X.
Then,

(i) ker(A ) = Im(A ∗)⊥
(ii) ker(A ∗) = Im(A )⊥.
In general, Dom(A ∗) ⊂ Y is not necessarily densely deﬁned. Nevertheless if one assumes that the spaces
X and Y are reﬂexive then one can prove by a separation argument that Dom(A ∗) is dense in Y ′. With this
consideration in mind one may then deﬁne A ∗∗ : Dom(A ∗∗) ⊂ X′′ → Y ′′ as an unbounded linear operator.
Even more, one has that

Note that, the largest possible domain of A is precisely the space

Dom(A ) = Dom(A ∗∗),

and A = A ∗∗ .

which we will term the A -Sobolev space in W

.

; Rd) → L2(W

2.2. Operators of Gradient form. We introduce an abstract class of linear differential operators A : Dom(A )⊂
L2(W
; Rk). This class contains scalar- and vector-valued gradients, higher gradients, and sym-
metrized gradients among its elements. The motiviation behind its deﬁnition is to be able to treat all of this
cases as a single case by employing a neat abtract setting. At a ﬁrst glance this framework may appear too
sterile, however, we hope that through the forthcoming examples and remarks it will turn somewhat natural.
In essence, this deﬁnition is only meant to capture some of the essential rigidity properties of gradients and
lower semi-continuity of gradient-valued functionals.

Deﬁnition 2.3. We say that an unbounded linear operator A : Dom(A ) ⊂ L2(W

: Rk) is of
gradient form if and only if it is a m-th order linear differential operator with constant coefﬁcients and the
following conditions for A hold:

; Rd) → L2(W

where H := {x = (x′,xN) ∈ RN : xN > 0}. Then, there exists a constant c∗ = c∗(a ,s ,N) > 0

such that

[A ˜u]2,N(Br(x)) ≤

focus on the exactness condition: Let 1 ≤ i ≤ N and let B(i) ∈ RNl+1
⊗ RNl be the tensor given by

In this case, Z = RNl

sym ⊂ RNk is the Euclidean space from Deﬁnition 2.3. It follows that,
Bl v =(cid:0)¶ pvi1...ih−1q ih+1...il − ¶ qvi1...ih−1 p ih+1...il(cid:1)
for some b1 ∈ RNl−1

for every 1 ≤ h ≤ l − 1 whenever v = vT . Let 0 6= x ∈ RN be given and assume that a ∈ Z (a =
aT ∈ RNl ) is such that B(x )a = 0, then one can prove that, similarly to the case of gradients, it
must be that a = b1 ⊗ x
sym . One may repeat the process using the symmetries of
a to actually deduce, after l − 1 steps, that there exists b ∈ R such that a = bx ⊗··· ⊗ x . Hence,
dim(ker B(x )) = 1 and thus the constant rank condition (†) is veriﬁed. Notice that, Bl v = 0 if and
only if for every 1 ≤ h ≤ l − 1,

vi1...ih−1 p ih+1...il = ¶ puh

vector-valued functions. The ideas remain the same, as a combination of examples (i) and (ii). In the

case of lth-order gradients of functions u : W ⊂ RN → Rd one simply obtains dim(ker B(x )) = 1.

Hence, A ∗∗ = A . Compactness is a result of Korn’s inequality and Relich’s Theorem, while the
regularity condition can be proved similarly to the case of gradients. In this case, the exactness con-
dition may be reduced to the case of gradients as in (i) with the following argument. The importance
of the exactness assumption is that it allows one to represent the lower semi-continuous hull of the
integral functional

by taking the B-free quasiconvex envelope of W . In our case, observe that we can re-write this as

W (A u)dx,

W (z) := min{s 1z· z, s 2z· z} ,

F(u) =ZW
W′((cid:209) u)dx,

Strictly speaking, this argument does not imply that A is a of gradient type. However, it tells us
that characterizing the lower semi-continuous envelope of F can be reduced to case (i). In any case,
one can prove an exactness condition for a second-order differential operator B : L2(W

with the following properties:
(1) We denote m x := m (x) for simplicity, then m x ≥ 0 in the sense of measures and |m x|(Rd) ≤ 1 for a.e.

Let F : X ≤ Rd → R be a lower semicontinuous function with 0 ≤ F(z) ≤ c(1 +|z|p). The B-quasivonvex

the characteristic function of A in the sense of distributions, i.e., m A := D(1A). We say that A is a set of locally
ﬁnite perimeter if and only if |m A| is a Radon measure. The perimeter of A in W

is deﬁned as

From De Giorgi’s Structure Theorem it is clear that spt m A = ¶ ∗A. Actually, up to modifying A on a set
of measure zero, one has that ¶ A = ¶ ∗A (see [23, Proposition 12.19]). From this point on, each time we deal
with a set A of ﬁnite perimeter we will assume without lose of generality that

¶ A = spt m A = ¶ ∗A.

A quantiﬁcation, for a set of locally ﬁnite perimeter A, of the deviation from being a perimeter minimizer in

DevW (A,r) := sup{ Per(A;Br(x))− Per(U;Br(x)) : UD A ⊂⊂ Br(x) ⊂ W }

The next result, due to Tamanini [27], states that sets of locally ﬁnite perimeter with small deviation at every
scale are actually C1-hypersurfaces up to a low dimensional set.

IW (A,u) ≥ Per(A;W ) ≥ 0.

Using the compactness property of A , there must exist ˜w ∈ Dom(A ) such that wh/k A whk2(W ) → ˜w in L2

lim

h k A whk2(W ) ≤ a −1k fk2kuk2

IW (A,wA). Since the uniform bound (8) does not depend on A, we may again assume (up to a subsequence)
that there exists w ∈ Dom(A ) such that

4. THE ENERGY BOUND: PROOF OF THEOREM 1.2

Throughout this section and for the rest of the manuscript we ﬁx A : D(A ) ⊂ L2(W

; Rk) in
the class of operators of gradient form. Accordingly, the notations Z and B : D(B) ⊂ L2(W
; Rl)
will be reserved for the subspace of Rk and the ﬁrst-order differential operator associated to A via the
exactness property in Deﬁnition 2.3.4. We will also write (w,A) to denote a particular solution of problem
(P). The goal of this section is to prove a local bound for the energy I(w,A) on balls. More precisely, we aim
to prove that for every compactly contained subset K of W
(LB)

there exists a postive number L K such that

; Rd) → L2(W
;X) → L2(W

IBr(x)(w,A) ≤ L KrN−1,

∀r ∈ (0,dist(K,¶ W )),∀x ∈ K.

Our strategy will be the following. We ﬁrst deﬁne a one-parameter family of perturbations Ie of I in the
perimeter term. In Theorem 4.1 we show that, as the perimeter term vanishes, these perturbations G -converge
to the relaxation of the energy

w 7→ZW

2 f wdx−ZW

W (A w)dx

for the weak L2 topology, for which we will assume certain regularity properties (cf. property (4)). Then, we
prove Theorem 1.2 by transferring the regularity properties of the relaxed problem to our original problem
by using a compensated compactness argument. Before proceeding, we would like to discuss how the higher
integrability property (4) stands next to the standard assumption that the materials s 1 and s 2 are well-ordered.
4.1. A digression on the regularization assumption. As commented beforehand in the introduction, a key
assumption in proving the upper bound (LB) must be done. We assume that generalized local minimizers of
the energy

w 7→ZB1
w 7→ZB1

W (A w)dx

QBW (A w)dx

possess improved decay estimates. More precisely, we will require that minimizers of the functional

(10)

enjoy a higher integrability estimate of the form

[A w]2,N−d (B1) ≤ ck A wk2

L2 (B1),

for some d ∈ [0,1).

Only then, we will be able to transfer a decay estimate of order r N−1 to solutions of our original problem.
However, it may not yet be clear how this assumption ﬁts in the context of meaningful applications. A brief
argumentation on this regard is described in the next lines.

4.1.1. The well-ordered case. The notion of well-ordering in Materials Science is not only justiﬁed as the
comparability of two materials, one being at least better than the other. It has also been a consistent as-
sumption when dealing with optimization problems because it allows explicit calculations. See for example
[16, 2, 1], where the authors discuss how the well-ordering assumption plays a role on proving the optimal
lower bounds of an effective tensor made-up by two materials. If this is the case, that s 1 and s 2 are well-
ordered, then W (z) = s z· z for some constant tensor s ∈ Sym(Rk ⊗ Rk). Hence, the constant coefﬁcients
regularity assumption for operators of gradient form provides the desired higher integrability estimates for
d = 0. In general, it is not easy to show that vector-valued problems as the one for linearized elasticity, or
higher order equations enjoy this decay estimates. If no well-ordering of the materials is assumed, one may
not expect but only partial regularity results when dealing with energies with general quasiconvex integrands,
see [11].

4.1.2. The non-ordered case. Applications for this setting are reserved for the scalar case. To be more
precise, when QBW = W ∗∗, and W∗∗ is the convex envelope of W . For example, one may consider an
optimal design problem involving the linear conductivity equations for two dielectric materials which happen
to be uncomparable as quadratic forms. In this setting, is not hard to see that indeed QW = W∗∗ and even
that W∗∗ ∈ C1,1(Rk, R). In dimensions N = 2,3, one can employ a Moser-iteration technique for the dual
problem as in [9] to show better regularity for minimizers of (10).

The exactness property yields the existence of a sequence {uh} ⊂ W A (B1) such that A uh = vh for every

that ue → u in the L2-strong topology. Next, we deﬁne an h-parametrised sequence of subsets of RN in the

5. THE LOWER BOUND: PROOF OF ESTIMATE (LB)

During this section we will set (w,A) to denote a solution of problem (P) under the assumptions of The-
orem 1.2. In light of the results obtained in the previous section we will assume, throughout the rest of the

paper, that for every compact set K ⊂⊂ W

there exist positive constants C = CK, and L = L K such that
IBr(x)(w,A) ≤ L rN−1,
[A w]2,N−1B(K) ≤ CK.

The main result of this section is a lower bound on the density of the perimeter in ¶ ∗A. In other words, there
exists a positive constant l = l (K,N) such that
(LB)

for every r > 0.

Per(A;Br(x)) ≥ l rN−1,

As we will see in Theorem 5.6, there will be two major consequences from estimate (LB). The ﬁrst one is
that the difference between the topological boundary of A and the reduced boundary of A is at most a set

of H N−1-measure zero. In other words, ¶ A\ ¶ ∗A = N where H N−1(N) = 0 (cf. [4, Theorem 2.2]). The

second implication is that (LB) is a necessary assumption for the Height bound Lemma and the Lipschitz
Approximation Lemma, essential tools to prove a ﬂatness improvement in the next section.

Granted that the dependence on (w,A) is understood, we will simply write D(r) and Eg (r). Recall that, up to
translation and re-scaling, we may assume

without any lose of generality when dealing with variational properties.

0 ∈ ¶ ∗A∩ K,

and B1 ⊂ W

,

We will proceed as follows. First we prove in Lemma 5.1 that if the density of the perimeter is sufﬁciently
small, then one can regard the regularity properties of solutions as those ones for an elliptic equation with
constant coefﬁcients. Then, in Lemma 5.2, we prove a lower bound on the decay of the density of the
perimeter. Combining these results, we are able to show a discrete monotonicity formula on the decay of
Eg . The proof of the lower density bound (LB) follows easily from this discrete monotonicity formula, De
Giorgi’s structure Theorem, and the upper bound of the previous section. Finally, we prove Theorem 5.6 as
a corollary of (LB).

Lemma 5.1. For every q 1 ∈ (0,1), there exist positive constants e 1(q ,N,c), c1(N), such that

whenever the following smallness conditions hold:

ZBr |A w|2 dx ≤ c1r NZB1 |A w|2 dx,
kDm−1wkL‘2(B1) ≤ c, Per(A;B1) ≤ e 1,

for every r ∈ (q 1,1),

and k fk¥ (B1) ≤ e 1.

Proof. The result holds for c1 = (1/2)−N if we assume r ≥ 1/2, therefore we show only the case r ∈
(q 1,1/2). We argue by contradiction. Fix c1 a constant to be speciﬁed later. For every h ∈ N we would ﬁnd
a solution (wh,Ah) of problem (P) in B1 with r h ∈ (q 1,1/2) for every h ∈ N with the following properties:
r h → r ∈ [q 1,1/2],

(41)

ZBr

h |A wh|2 dx > c1r N

and simultaneously the conditions

and k fhk¥ (B1) ≤

hold. Since Per(Ah;B1) → 0, the isoperimetric yields that either s Ah → s 1 or s Ah − s 1 in L2 as h tends
to inﬁnity. We assume that the former convergence s Ah → s 1 holds. One may further assume, by a nor-
malization argument that k A whk2
2(B1) ≤ 1 and due to the compactness of A and kDm−1wk2(B1) ≤ c, that
wh → w in W m−1,2(B1) for some w ∈ L2(W

The next lemma is the principal ingredient in proving the (LB) estimate. It relies in a cone-like comparison
to show that the decay of density is controlled by D(r)/r. Hence, the perimeter density cannot blow-up while
the density of perimeter is small.
Lemma 5.2. There exist a positive constants e 2 = e 2(N) and c2 = c2(a ,b ,N) such that

Proof. For a.e. r ∈ (0,1) the slice hA, f ,ri, where f (x) = |x|, is well deﬁned. Fix one such r and let ˜A be the
cone extension to hA, f ,ri, which has shares the same Dirichlet boundary conditions as A. By minimality of
(w,A) and and a duality argument, we get

ZBr

s AA w : A wdx + Per(A;Br) ≤ a −1ZBr

˜AA w· A wdx + Per( ˜A;Br).

Hence,

The following result is a discrete monotonicity for the weighted excess energy Eg . We remark that, in

general, a monotonicity formula may not be expected in the case of systems.

Notice that, the main assumption on the previous result is the smallness of Eg . The next proposition links

the smallness of the density of the perimeter to the smallness of Eg .

Proposition 5.4. Let d be a positive constant. There exist positive numbers e 4 = e (d ) and q 4 = q 4(c1,C) ∈
(0,1) such that

whenever the smallness assumption

holds.

Proof. Fix q 4,e 4 ∈ (0,1) such that

e 4 ≤ min(e 1(c1,q 3),

We now turn to the proof of (LB). The idea is that negation of the estimate (LB) provide a solution to
problem (P) in B1 with sufﬁciently low density of perimeter to apply the discrete monotonicity from Theorem
5.3. A contradiction is reached after observing this monotonicity violates the H N−1 almost everywhere
characterization given by De Giorgi’s Structure Theorem.
Theorem 5.5. Let (w,A) be a solution for problem (P) in W
there exist positive constants l K and RK depending only on K, the dimension N, and f such that

and let K ⊂⊂ W

be a compact subset. Then,

Per(A;Br(x)) ≥ l KrN−1,

for every r ∈ (0,RK) and for every x ∈ ¶ ∗A∩ K.

26

ADOLFO ARROYO-RABASA

Proof. We argue by a contradiction. Let us suppose there exists a point x ∈ int(K) ∩ ¶ ∗A and r ∈ (0,RK)
sufﬁciently small such that the re-scaled function of f , f r, has the property that

(44)

for which

(45)

k f rk¥ (B1) ≤ e 1.

Per(A;Br(x))

and e ≤ e 4(e 3)

for q 4 = q 4(e 3,CK). Up to translation and re-scaling, we get a solution(cid:0) ˜w, ˜A(cid:1) for problem (P) in W = B1 and

f = f r with

(46)

On the other side,

Per(cid:0) ˜A;B1(cid:1) = e .
Since e ≤ e 4(e 3), it follows from Theorem 5.3, (44), and (45) that

D( ˜w, ˜A;1) = D(w;Br(x)) ≤ CK.

Eg (w,A;Bq 4r(x)) = Eg ( ˜w, ˜A;q 4) ≤ e 3.

An iteration of this process yields

Eg (w,A;B(q 4) jr(x)) = Eg ( ˜w, ˜A; (q 4) j) ≤ e 3,

for every j ∈ N.

Hence,

The latter inequality is a contradiction to the fact that x ∈ ¶ ∗A and (47).

6. THE FLATNESS EXCESS IMPROVEMENT AND FURTHER REGULARITY: PROOF OF THEOREM 1.3

(LB)

Due to the results of the past section, we will assume for the rest of the manuscript that for every K ⊂⊂ W

there exists l K,cK > 0 such that D(w;x,r) ≤ cK and

Per(A,Br(x)) ≥ l KrN−1,

∀ x ∈ (¶ A∩ K),∀ r ∈ (0,RK).

We introduce the notion of ﬂatness excess, and energy excess with respect to a hyper-plane. Given a set of

locally ﬁnite perimeter A ⊂ RN, the cylindrical excess of A at a point x ∈ ¶ A, at scale r > 0, and with respect
to the direction n ∈ Sn−1, is deﬁned as
e(x,r,n ;A) : =

|n E (y)− n |2

d H n−1(y)

rN−1ZC(x,r,n )∩¶ ∗A
= |m A|(C(x,r,n ))−hm A,n i

2

.

rN−1

Intuitively, it expresses for a set A, the deviation from being a half-plane H at a given scale r. Note that e
scales as rN−1 on the radius variable. Hence, up to re-scaling, translating and rotating, it will be enough to
work the case

x = 0,

n = eN,

and r = 1,

in this case, we will simply write e(A). The hyper-plane energy excess is deﬁned as

Hex(w,A;x,r,n ) := e(x,r,n ;A) + D(w,A;x,r),
and as long as its dependencies are understood we will shorten the notation to

Hex(r) = e(r) + D(r),

The aim of this section is to show that given a saddle pair (w,A) of (P), with A is sufﬁciently close to a hyper-
plane at a point x ∈ ¶ A, the interface ¶ A remains close to a hyperplane at smaller scales in a neighbourhood of

x. In order to proceed, we state two very important lemmas with celebrated counterparts in the general theory
of minimal surfaces. These results go back to H. Federer in full generality within the framework of minimal
currents [12, §5.3]. For an approach restricted to sets of ﬁnite perimeter we refer the interested reader to
[23, Theorem 22.8, Theorem 23.7]. The ﬁrst one, the Height bound Lemma, requires no modiﬁcation to our
setting since the proof relies only on the (LB) property. For the second lemma, minor modiﬁcations within
the standard methods are in place to adapt it to our notions. However, we will not pursue them since they can
be inferred in the same fashion as in [23].
Lemma 6.1 (Height bound). There exists positive constants e ∗1 = e ∗1 (N) and c∗1 = c∗1(N) with the following
property. If A ⊂ RN is a set of locally ﬁnite perimeter with the (LB) property,

0 ∈ ¶ A and e(9) ≤ e ∗1 .
sup{|yN| : y ∈ C1 ∩ ¶ A} ≤ c∗1 · e(4)
(HB)
Lemma 6.2 (Lipschitz Approximation). There exists positive constants e ∗2 (N), c∗2(N) and d ∗(N) with the
following property. If (w,A) is a solution pair of problem (P) in B9 with
∀0 < r ≤ 1

Remark 6. Observe that every property enunciated in the height bound Lemma 6.1 and the Lipschitz approx-
imation Theorem 6.2 is invariant under scalings of order N − 1.

The next decay Lemma is just the half-plane interpretation of Lemma 5.1 and Lemma 5.4, its proof is

similar except that it relies on the regularity assumption Deﬁnition 2.3.3.2 for operators of gradient from.

Lemma 6.3. Let (w,A) be a solution of problem (P) in B1. Then, for every q ∈ (0,1/2) there exist positive

The next lemma is a weak Caccioppoli inequality in the sense that the error is in terms of the ﬂatness
excess itself and is not only dependent on the radius difference. Nevertheless, as we will see later, this will
be enough to get a ﬂatness excess improvement (up to tilting) by using the previous result.

6.2. Regularity of solutions. We apply the ﬂatness excess for solution in B9 to general saddle points. Let
(w,A) be a saddle point of problem (P) in W
. On the one side, the upper bound cK provides
a local estimate c(x) for D(x,r). On the other side, up to a rotation and a translation, De Giorgi’s Structure
Theorem imply that for H N−1-a.e. point x in ¶ A∩ W

a simple consequence of the absolute continuity of the integral and the continuity of m A(Bs(x)) whenever
m A(¶ Bs) = 0. Hence, there is an open neighbourhood of 0, U(x) for which

and ¶ ∗A is an open C1,

.

Moreover, A w is locally bounded in (W \ (¶ A \ ¶ ∗A)) and, in this set, the trace of A w exists locally on
either side of ¶ A.
Proof. We divide the proof in two parts. The ﬁrst one devoted to the regularity of ¶ A and the second one to
the regularity of w.

The reduced boundary is an open hypersurface. From Corollary 6.10.2, we know that ¶ ∗A is relatively
open in ¶ A∩ W

. We also know, that for any ﬁxed K ⊂⊂ W

there exist constants cK and rK such that

D(w,A;x,r) ≤ cK,

for every x ∈ K, and every r ∈ (0,rK).

Through translation, rotation, and re-scaling arguments we apply Corollary 6.10.1 to obtain an improvement
on the ﬂatness excess of the type

where C = C(d ,K) is a local constant. We conclude with an application of Tamanini’s Theorem 2.9:

¶ ∗A is an open C1,h /2-hypersurface in Bd (x).

(one simply uses that ¶ ∗A is open
In proving this type of local regularity sufﬁces to state the same result in W
in ¶ A). The fact that H N−1((¶ \ ¶ ∗A)∩ W ) = 0 has been proven in Theorem 5.6 as a consequence of the

lower bound on the density of the perimeter.

Regularity for w. We aim to prove local regularity outside the set ¶ A\ ¶ ∗A. Therefore, after a translation,
rotation and re-scaling, we may restrict ourselves to the case when there exists j
: C′1 → (−1,1) such that

¶ A∩C1 = {(x′,xN) : xN = j (x′),(cid:209)

j (0) = j (0) = 0, [j ]1,b /2(C′1) ≤ 1}
