In their simplest form, the Caﬀarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities are a two parameter
family of inequalities. It has been known that there is a region in parameter space where
the optimizers for the inequalities have broken symmetry. It has been shown recently
that in the complement of this region the optimizers are radially symmetric. The ideas
for the proof will be given.

Keywords: Caﬀarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities; symmetry; symmetry breaking; opti-
mal constants; rigidity results; fast diﬀusion equation.

1. Introduction

Symmetries of optimizers in variational problems is a central theme in the calculus of
variations. Sophisticated methods like rearrangement inequalities, reﬂection meth-
ods and moving plane methods belong now to the standard repertoire of any analyst.
There are, however, examples where these methods cannot be applied. Variational
problems that depend on parameters very often cannot be treated by such meth-
ods, simply because, depending on the parameters, the optimizers are symmetric
and sometimes not. Famous examples are the minimizers of the Ginzburg-Landau
functional in superconductivity, where, depending on the strength of the quartic in-
teraction the minimizers form a single, symmetric vortex or a vortex lattice. Clearly
such problems cannot be treated by general methods. For certain parameters they
ought to work while in others they cannot. Thus, rather special techniques, tailored
to the problems at hand, have to be developed to prove symmetry in the desired
regions.

One class of such examples is given by the Caﬀarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequali-

2

ties [3]. In these notes, we shall speciﬁcally consider the case of the inequality

ZRd

|∇w|2
|x|2a

dx ≥ Cd

a,b(cid:18)ZRd

|w|p
|x|bp

dx(cid:19)2/p

(CKN)

with a ≤ b ≤ a + 1 if d ≥ 3 , a < b ≤ a + 1 if d = 2 , and a < ac where

ac :=

d − 2

2

,

p =

2 d

d − 2 + 2 (b − a)

.

The function w is in a suitable function space which contains, for instance, all
smooth functions with compact support. The constant Cd
a,b is, by deﬁnition, the
best possible constant. Rotating the function w does not change the value of the
various expressions in (CKN), i.e., the inequality is rotationally invariant. The
special case where a ≥ 0 has been treated by various authors (see the references
in [7]). Rearrangement inequalities can be used to reduce the problem to the set of
radial functions, for which the optimality issue can then be solved explicitly.

For the case where a < 0 the problem is much more subtle. Nevertheless,
Catrina and Wang [6], proved that the optimizers, i.e., the functions that yield
equality in (CKN), exist in the open strip a < b < a + 1. This result establishes the
existence of non-negative solutions w ∈ Lp(Rd;|x|−bp dx) of the equation

− div(cid:0)|x|−2a ∇w(cid:1) = |x|−bp wp−1 .

(1)

Moreover, in the same paper Catrina and Wang also showed that, in some region
in the (a, b) plane, the rotational symmetry of the optimizers is broken. A more
detailed analysis by Felli and Schneider [8] shows that the region where the optimiz-
ers have a broken symmetry contains the set RFS := {(a, b) : a < 0 , b < bFS(a)}
where

bFS(a) :=

d (ac − a)

2p(ac − a)2 + d − 1
We call this region RFS the Felli-Schneider region.

+ a − ac .

In [8] more is shown. The optimizers in the radial class can be determined
explicitly which allows to compute the second variation operator about these solu-
tions. The lowest eigenvalue of this operator is strictly negative for (a, b) ∈ RFS,
equals zero on the curve b = bFS(a) and is strictly positive in the open complement
of the Felli-Schneider region: there, the radial optimizers are stable. Needless to say
that positivity of the second variation does not imply the radial symmetry of the
(global) optimizers for the (CKN) inequality. Thus, it is a natural question whether
or not the optimizers possess rotational symmetry in the complement of RFS. Let
2∗ := 2 d

d−2 if d ≥ 3 and 2∗ := ∞ if d = 2. The following theorem is proved in [7]:

Theorem 1.1. Let d ≥ 2, p ∈ (2, 2∗), a < 0 and b in the complement of the Felli-
Schneider region and such that p =
d−2+2 (b−a) . Then any non-negative solution

2 d

w ∈ Lp(Rd;|x|−bp dx) of (1) must be of the form
(cid:0)A + B |x|2α(cid:1)− n−2

where A, B are positive constants,

and

α =

(1 + a − b) (ac − a)

ac − a + b

In particular this holds for the optimizers of (CKN).

n =

.

There are some interesting consequences. Using the change of variables

equation (1) can be cast in the form

w(r, ω) = ra−ac φ(cid:0) log r, ω(cid:1) ,
z φ − ∆ω φ + Λ φ = φp−1 .
− ∂2

(4)
|x| = ω ∈ Sd−1, r = |x|, z = log r, ∆ω is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on

Here, x
the sphere Sd−1 and

Λ = (a − ac)2 .

Thus, φ is a function on the cylinder R × Sd−1. Moreover, as noticed in [6], (CKN)
is transformed into
k∂zφk2

L2(R×Sd−1) + k∇ωφk2

L2(R×Sd−1) + Λ kφk2

Lp(R×Sd−1) .

L2(R×Sd−1) ≥ Cd

(5)

Corollary 1.1. Let d ≥ 2, p ∈ (2, 2∗). Any non-negative solution φ ∈ Lp(R ×
Sd−1; dz dω) of (4) is, up to translations, of the form

if and only if

p−2

√Λ z(cid:1)(cid:17)− 1

,

φΛ(z) =(cid:16) 2

2

p Λ cosh2(cid:0) p−2
d − 1
Λ ≤ 4
p2 − 4

.

In this range, equality in (5) is achieved if and only if φ(z) = φΛ(z + z0) for some
z0 ∈ R.
To put this result in perspective we compare it with a result in [2].

Theorem 1.2. Let d ≥ 2, p ∈ (2, 2∗). On the sphere Sd consider the equation

∆u + λ u = up−1

4

with λ > 0. Here ∆ represents the Laplace-Beltrami operator on Sd. Then the
constant function u ≡ λ1/(p−2) is the only non-negative solution if and only if

λ ≤

d
p − 2

.

Thus, Corollary 1.1 can be viewed as an extension of the above mentioned rigidity
result to the non-compact case of a cylinder. As a special case, this also allows to
identify the equality case in the interpolation inequality (5) on the cylinder.

In the next sections some ideas about the proof are given: we start by the simple
case of the standard Sobolev inequality in Section 2, explain in Section 3 how to
recast (CKN) as a Sobolev type inequality in an artiﬁcial dimension n, where n is
not necessarily an integer, and conclude by explaining how the main estimates can
be produced using a fast diﬀusion ﬂow.

2. Heuristics for the proof of Theorem 1.1

In order to avoid long computations it is best to explain the ideas in a ‘simple’
example. For any d ≥ 3, the Sobolev inequality
ZRd |∇u|2 dx ≥ Cd(cid:18)ZRd |u|p dx(cid:19)2/p

, with p = 2∗ =

2 d
d − 2

(6)

is extremely well understood [1, 9, 10]. Once more Cd denotes the sharp constant.
Note that this inequality appears as a special case of (CKN) if one sets a = b = 0,
in which case Cd = Cd
0,0. There is equality in (6) if and only if u is a translate of
the Aubin-Talenti function

(cid:18)c⋆ λ + |x|2

λ (cid:19)−(d−2)/2

,

where c⋆ and λ are positive constants. There have been some proofs using ﬂow
methods to understand this inequality [4, 5]. The ﬂow used for the case at hand is
a porous medium / fast diﬀusion ﬂow. It is given by

∂ v
∂t

= ∆v1− 1

d

(7)

and has the self-similar solutions

v⋆(x, t) =(cid:18)c⋆ t + |x|2

t (cid:19)−d

.

This function has slow decay in the x variable. The obvious similarity of the ex-
pressions of the Aubin-Talenti and self-similar functions suggests a reformulation of
the Sobolev functional by setting

v = u

2 d

d−2 .

Let us deﬁne a pressure variable p by

v = p−d .

A short computation shows

Lemma 2.1. The Sobolev inequality, written in terms of v and p, is given by

Assume now that v satisﬁes the fast diﬀusion equation (7). This implies that p
evolves by the equation

The right side of (8) does not change if v evolves via (7). For the left side we have

d (Tr Hp) Id = 0

where Hp = (∇ ⊗ ∇) p denotes the Hessian matrix of p. Moreover,

if and only if p(x) = a + b · x + c|x|2 for some (a, b, c) ∈ R × Rd × R.
The proof is a somewhat longish but straightforward computation. Note, that it is
precisely the particular choice of v and p that renders the time derivative in such a
simple form.

To summarize, while the right side of the Sobolev inequality stays ﬁxed the left
side diminishes under the ﬂow. The idea is to use the fast diﬀusion ﬂow to drive the
functional towards its optimal value. Actually we use the fact that if v is optimal
in (8), or if it is a critical point, the functional has to be stationary under the action
of the ﬂow, which allows to identify p, hence v. To exploit this idea for the (CKN)
inequality we have to rewrite it in the form of a Sobolev type inequality.

3. A modiﬁed Sobolev inequality

The ﬁrst step in the proof is to rewrite the problem in a form that resembles the
Sobolev inequality. If we write

w(r, ω) = u(s, ω) with s = rα ,

6

the inequality (CKN) takes the form

+ |∇ωu|2

p  ZR+×Sd−1 |u|p sn−1 ds dω!
ZR+×Sd−1"α2(cid:18) ∂u
∂s(cid:19)2
where dω denotes the uniform measure on the sphere Sd−1, ∇ω denotes the gradient
on Sd−1 and where α and n are given by (2) and (3). We shall abbreviate

# sn−1 ds dω ≥ Cd

a,b α1− 2

s ∇ωu(cid:1) ,

∂s(cid:1)2
|Du|2 = α2(cid:0) ∂u

+ |∇ω u|2

s2

.

Our inequality is therefore equivalent to a Sobolev type inequality and takes the
form

ZR+×Sd−1 |Du|2 dµ ≥ Cd
This inequality generalizes (6). Here the measure dµ is deﬁned on R+ × Sd−1 by

p  ZR+×Sd−1 |u|p dµ!

2 n
n − 2

, with p =

a,b α1− 2

.

(9)

p

dµ = sn−1 ds dω .

As in Section 2, we may consider v = up and deﬁne a pressure variable p such that
v = p−n, so that u = p−(n−2)/2. With these notations, (9) can be rewritten as

4 (n − 2)2ZR+×Sd−1

v |Dp|2 dµ ≥ Cd

a,b α1− 2

p  ZR+×Sd−1

2
p

v dµ!

(10)

With straightforward abuses of notations, we shall write RR+×Sd−1 f dµ = RRd f dµ
and identify Lp(R+ × Sd−1; dµ) with Lp(Rd;|x|n−d dx) or simply Lp(Rd; dµ).

One should note that n is, in general, not an integer and the above inequality
reduces to Sobolev’s inequality only if n = d. Of particular signiﬁcance is that the
curve

b = bFS(a) ,

when represented in the new variables α and n, is given by the equation α = αFS
with

αFS :=r d − 1
n − 1

.

Thus, for α > αFS the minimizers are not radial. The equation (1) transforms into
the equation

− L u = up−1 ,

(11)

where L is the Laplacian associated with the quadratic form given by the left side
of (9), i.e., L = − D∗ · D. Theorem 1.1 can be reformulated as

Theorem 3.1. Let d ≥ 2, p ∈ (2, 2∗), n = 2 p
non-negative solution u ∈ Lp(Rd; dµ) of (11) must be of the form
(cid:0)A + B |x|2(cid:1)− n−2

2

where A, B are positive constants, and n is given by (3). As a special case, equality
in (10) is achieved if and only if u is given by (12).

p−2 > d and α ≤ αFS. Then any

(12)

The upshot of this work can be summarized in the following fashion: Any opti-
mizer in the radial class that is not unstable under small perturbations is in fact a
global minimizer for the (CKN) inequality.

4. The ﬂow

We consider the fast diﬀusion ﬂow

∂ v
∂t

= L v1− 1

n .

(13)

It is easily seen that the ﬂow (13) has the self-similar solutions

v⋆(t; s, ω) = t−n(cid:18)c⋆ +

s2

2 (n − 1) α2 t2(cid:19)−n

.

The basic idea is now quite simple. We consider a non-negative solution u ∈
Lp(Rd; dµ) of (11) and set v = up. We also consider the pressure variable p such
that v = p−n. The ﬁrst thing to note is that the right side of (10) does not change
if we evolve v and hence u under the ﬂow (13). Further, if we diﬀerentiate the left
side of (10) along the ﬂow we obtain

On the other hand simple computations show that

= − 2ZR+×Sd−1

(L u) u1−p(cid:0)L up (n−1)/n(cid:1) dµ (14)

when expressed in terms of u. Now we take v = up, where u is the solution to (11),
as initial datum for (1). With this choice, the right side in (14) is actually zero.

Indeed, by multiplying both sides of (11) by u1−p(cid:0)L up (n−1)/n(cid:1) one obtains
ZR+×Sd−1

(L u) u1−p(cid:0)L up (n−1)/n(cid:1) dµ =ZR+×Sd−1

up−1 u1−p(cid:0)L up (n−1)/n(cid:1) dµ = 0 .

The interesting point, and the heart of the argument, is that

0 =ZR+×Sd−1(cid:2) 1

2 L|Dp|2 − Dp · DL p − 1

n (L p)2(cid:3) dµ

8

can be written as a sum of non-negative terms precisely when α ≤ αFS, and the
vanishing of these terms shows that u must be of the form (A + B s2)−(n−2)/2. In
this way one obtains a classiﬁcation of the non-negative solutions of (11) provided
they are in Lp(Rd; dµ). To simplify notations, we shall omit the index ω, so that
from now on ∇ and ∆ respectively refer to the gradient and to the Laplace-Beltrami
operator on Sd−1. With the notation ′ = ∂s, our identity can be reworked as follows.

Lemma 4.1. Assume that d ≥ 3, n > d and let p be a positive function in C3(Sd−1).

The only term in Lemma 4.1 that does not have a sign is the last one. When
integrated against p1−n over Sd−1, however, this term can be written as a sum of
squares. The following lemma holds for d ≥ 3. For the case d = 2 we refer the
reader to [7].

The key device used for the proof of this lemma is the Bochner-Lichnerowicz-

function f : M → R we have

If M = Sd−1, then
the Ricci curvature tensor contracted against ∇f ⊗ ∇f .
Ric(∇f,∇f ) = (d − 2)|∇f|2. The main point in Lemma 4.2 is that, provided
α ≤ αFS, all terms are non-negative.

9

It is quite easy to see that the vanishing of these terms entails that p can only

depend on the variable s = |x| and must be of the form (12).

While the formal computations are straightforward there is the perennial issue
of the boundary terms that occur in all the integration by parts. This is due to
the fact that one is dealing with solutions of (11) and it is not at all clear that the
boundary terms vanish. This requires a detailed regularity analysis of the solutions
of (11). The task is non-trivial because the exponent p is critical for the scaling in
the s variable. The reader may consult [7] for details.

The computations outlined above can be carried over to the case where Sd−1 is
replaced by a compact Riemannian manifold M of dimension d− 1. The results are
then expressed in terms of the Ricci curvature of the manifold. Again the reader
may consult [7] for details.
