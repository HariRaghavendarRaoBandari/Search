We investigate the temporal evolution of electronic states in strontium iridate Sr2IrO4. The time
resolved photoemission spectra of intrinsic, electron doped and the hole doped samples are monitored
in identical experimental conditions. Our data on intrinsic and electron doped samples, show that
primary doublon-holon pairs relax near to the chemical potential on a timescale shorter than 70 fs.

The subsequent cooling of low energy excitations takes place in two step: a rapid dynamics of ∼= 120
fs is followed by a slower decay of ∼= 1 ps. The reported timescales endorse the analogies between
Sr2IrO4 and copper oxides.

The layered Sr2IrO4 is an ideal system where to ex-
plore electronic correlations, electron-phonon coupling
and antiferromagnetic ordering. Strontium iridate is a
quasi-two-dimensional compound with partially ﬁlled 5d
shell and moderate Coulomb repulsion. In spite of the
large extension of 5d orbitals, the subtle interplay of spin-
orbit interaction, crystal ﬁeld splitting and antiferromag-
netic interaction leads to an insulating state1,2. Due to
super-exchange interaction, the groundstate of Sr2IrO4
holds canted antiferromagnetic ordering of the spins on a
squared lattice3. As in the case of copper oxides4, the
paramagnetic insulator can be viewed as intermediate
Mott-Slater system that is stabilized by short-range cor-
relations of the antiferromagnetic order5. The analogy
with cuprates can be pushed further6,7, insofar as doped
Sr2IrO4 is considered a promising candidate where to ob-
serve high temperature superconductivity8.

It is worth questioning whether iridates and cuprates
display the same dynamical behavior upon photoexcita-
tion. In this respect, the insulating copper oxides have
already been characterized by exhaustive experiments of
transient absorption9. H. Okamoto et al. measured at
diﬀerent probing frequencies, thereby disentangling the
Drude component from the mid-gap response. It follows
that mid-gap states arise on a timescale of 40 fs and expe-
rience an initial decay within 200 fs. The iridates seem to
display a similar response, although the reported experi-
ments have been performed with probing energy exceed-
ing the optical gap value10,11. D. Hsieh et al. observed
a biexponential kinetic and analyzed the eﬀects of the
magnetic transition on the relaxation time10.

The purpose of this work is to directly follow the re-
laxation of electronic states in Sr2IrO4. We report a
time resolved photoemission experiment of the intrin-
sic and chemically doped samples. Our data indicate
that primary doublon holon pairs are highly unstable
against the formation of mid-gap states. The dynamics
of such secondary excitations follow a biexponential law

that is compatible to the transient absorption reported
9. Our results provide further insights on the
in La2CuO4
electron dynamics of Mott insulators and reinforce the
analogies between iridates and cuprates.

Methods: Samples have been synthesized by a self ﬂux
method3. Electron doping is obtained by substituting
3% of the Sr atoms with La, whereas hole doping is done
by replacing 15% of Sr atoms with Rh. The crystals
have been characterized by X-ray diﬀraction, resistivity,
magnetization measurements and angle resolved photo-
electron spectroscopy. Time resolved photoemission ex-
periments were performed on the FemtoARPES setup12,
using a Ti:sapphire laser system delivering 35 fs pulses
at 780 nm with 250 kHz repetition rate. Part of the laser
beam is used to generate a UV probe pulse for photoemis-
sion. The 6.3 eV photons are obtained through cascade
frequency mixing in BBO crystals. The energy resolu-

tion is ∼= 60 meV (limited by the energy bandwidth of
the UV pulses) and the temporal resolution is ∼= 60 fs.

All the time resolved photomission measurements were
performed at room temperature and at the base pressure
of 7 × 10−11 mbars.

Samples Characterization: Figure 1(a,b) show exam-
ples of the resistivity and magnetization measurements
in three diﬀerent samples. The intrinsic Sr2IrO4 exhibits
an insulating behavior with an activation energy of 30-
70 meV. Upon chemical doping, the conductivity drops
by two orders of magnitude. The magnetic phase tran-
sition is barely visible at electron-doping (3% La) and it
vanishes at hole-doping (15% Rh).

According to the literature, the lower Hubbard band
has orbital character Jef f = 1/2 and reaches the nearest
distance from the chemical potential at the X point of
the Brillouin zone1,13. As shown in Fig. 1(c) the Hub-
bard peak is at ∼= −0.25 eV in the intrinsic sample and
shifts to ∼= −0.6 eV after La substitution13. Upon hole
doping (15% Rh), the peak of the Jef f = 1/2 band moves
at ∼= −0.1 eV from the chemical potential, giving rise to a

small pseudogap instead of a quasiparticle crossing. We

estimate a Mott gap of ∼= 0.6 eV from the diﬀerence of
the Jef f = 1/2 position in hole doped and electron doped
compound13. This value is consistent with Scanning Tun-
neling Spectroscopy (STS) measurements on sample re-
gions with no defects14,15. The presence of defects is an
unavoidable complexity that has strong impact on the
low energy physics of iridates13–16. STS experiments con-
ﬁrmed that defects induce a local collapse of the Mott
gap14 and established a relation between mid-gap states
and oxygen impurities15.

Finally, we show in Fig. 1(d) the spectra acquired with
6 eV photon energy at the center of the Brillouin zone and
normalized to the photon ﬂux. In the intrinsic sample,
the direct photoemission from the Jef f = 1/2 band and
the weak unklapp of the Jef f = 3/2 band should peak at
1.2 eV and 0.5 eV respectively1,13. However, the signal in
Fig. 1(d) mainly arises from photoelectronic emission as-
sisted by surface roughness and phonons. It is reasonable
to assume that these energy distribution curves provide
a rough indication of the electron-removal spectral func-
tion integrated over the wavevector index. In agreement
with Fig. 1(c), we observe a large shift of spectral weight
due to electron or hole doping.

ent samples as a function of delay time. The diﬀerential
intensity is plotted on a colorscale where red and blue
stand for photoinduced reduction and increase of photo-
electron yield, respectively. Intensity map of Fig. 2(a),
2(b) and 2(c) have been acquired on Rh-substituted, in-
trinsic and La-substituted compound. We employed a
pumping ﬂuence of 0.7mJ/cm2, leading to ∼ 0.04 exci-
tations per iridium atom. The data suggest that pho-
toexcited electrons do not accumulate in the upper Hub-
bard band but relax in electronic states near to chemical
potential. This ﬁnding is in contrast to recent time re-
solved photoemission measurements of the Mott insula-
17. We propose two possible scenarios to explain
tor UO2
the observed discrepancy. First, the Sr2IrO4 has a Mott
gap (0.6 eV) much smaller than the one of UO2 (2.3
eV)17. Therefore the rate of multi-phonon and multi-

magnon emission18,19 could be strong enough to relax
electrons across the correlation gap of Sr2IrO4 whereas
it may be negligible in UO2. Second, we know from STS
data14,15 that defects locally disrupt the narrow Mott
gap of Sr2IrO4. As a consequence, the excited electrons
may ﬁnd viable paths to relax from the upper Hubbard
band down to lower lying energies.

We outline in Fig. 2(a-c) that a photoinduced increase
of photoemission yield extends well below the chemical
potential. A combination of intrinsic and extrinsic ef-
fects can explain this ﬁnding. On one hand, an intrin-
sic increase of spectral weight between the lower Hub-
bard band and the chemical potential (dotted rectan-
gles in Fig. 2) is expected because of the partial ﬁlling
of the Mott gap. This behavior has been observed in
1T-TaS2 at comparable excitation densities and should
be a general property of Mott insulators with narrow
gap20,21. On the other hand, an extrinsic and time de-
pendent shift of the spectrum can arise from the sudden
change of dielectric properties at the surface of the sam-
ple. We already observed spectral shift generated by local
ﬁelds in copper oxides22, small gap semiconductors23 and
semimetals24. As in the case of surface photovoltage, we
expect the energy displacement to be more important in
the intrinsic compound than in samples with Rh or La
substitutions. Future experiments with high harmonic
sources17,25 could access the X point of the brillouin zone
and may shed light on this issue.

Dynamics of the electrons: Figure 3(a) shows pump-on
minus pump-oﬀ spectra acquired in the intrinsic sample,
at delay time of 25 fs and diﬀerent pumping ﬂuences. The
spectra have similar shape and are nearly proportional to
the pumping ﬂuence. Therefore, the photoexcited state
is still far from the saturation regime of a collapsed Mott
insulator21.

We show in Fig. 3(b) the pump-on minus pump-oﬀ
spectra of the intrinsic sample acquired with excitation
ﬂuence of 0.7 mJ/cm2 at diﬀerent pump-probe delays.
Notice that electrons at excitation energy higher than
∼= 0.1 eV follow an exponential distribution exp(−/kTe)
with temperature scale Te attaining a maximal value of
1900 K. In order to gain further insights of the electronic
relaxation, we plot in Fig. 3(c) the temporal evolution of
the signal integrated in the energy interval [0.1,0.2] eV.
A ﬁt accounting for the cross-correlation between pump
and probe beam provides the decay time τ1
timescale does not change with respect to photoexcita-
tion density and indicates that primary doublon-holons
pairs relax near the chemical potential on an very short
timescale. Our results are in line with the sudden decay
of the Drude response observed by Okamoto et al.
in
photoexcited cuprates9.

Next we turn on the temporal evolution of the pump-
probe signal in the spectral region where mid-gap states
accumulate. We cannot resolve any ﬁnite rise time in
the pump-probe signal, indicating that mid-gap states
are formed within less than 60 fs. Figure 3(d) shows the
evolution of the photoelectron intensity integrated in the

the presence of the two timescales is clearly resolved by
plotting the decay curve on a logarithmic scale. Similar
dynamics have been also reported in experiments of tran-
sient reﬂectivity at 1.5 eV10. Most importantly, we out-
line here the clear analogy between iridates and cuprates.
According to Okamoto et al., the midgap states of pho-

not observe any ﬂuence dependence in the slow timescale
τ3. Conversely, Fig. 3(f) shows a weak increase of τ2
by lowering the photoexcitation density. At last, Fig. 4
compares the dynamics of the signal acquired on the in-
trinsic, Rh-substitued and La-substituted sample. Strik-
ingly, we observe an identical temporal behavior in the
three diﬀerent samples.
Independently on the doping,
the excited electrons integrated in the interval [0.1,0.2]
eV decay with time constant τ1 = 70 fs.
Instead, the
midgap states in the energy window [-0.1,0] eV follow a
biexponential decay with time constants τ2 = 120 fs and
τ3 = 1.1 ps.

In conclusion, time resolved photoemission measure-
ments of Sr2IrO4 reveal the electrons dynamics upon pho-
toexcitation above bandgap. The primary holon-doublon
pairs decay in to midgap states on an ultrafast timescale.
Presumably, this behavior arises from emission of collec-
tive excitations and defect mediated decay. We report
identical dynamics in intrinsic and doped compounds,
suggesting that metallicity and screening do not inﬂu-
ence the relaxation of the photoexcited electrons. Our
time resolved photoemission data of iridates are in good
agreement with optical experiments on copper oxides,
providing compelling evidence of common dynamics in
these intermediate Mott-Slater insulators.

toexcited La2CuO4 display an initial relaxation taking
place within 200 fs9. Such fast recovery of the charge
gap is typical of Mott insulators, whereas does not take
place in correlated insulators where the partial gap ﬁlling
comes along with large structural distortions27,28.

As in the case of cuprates9,22,26, we ascribe the τ2
decay to the energy dissipation via emission of optical
phonons or localized vibrations. The slower dynamics
τ3 is instead due to anharmonicity and acoustic phonon
emission. Within our experimental accuracy we could
