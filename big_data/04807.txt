Abstract

Properties of the yrast states of a system of N bosons conﬁned to a one-dimensional ring and in-
teracting via contact forces is examined both variationally and by numerical diagonalizations. The
latter allow for obtaining numerical correlated many-body wave functions explicitly. The study
of correlation functions involving diﬀerent yrast states indicates that a quantum phase transition
previously detected in the properties of the ground state in the case of attractive two-body interac-
tions is an yrast phenomenon involving the onset of ‘deformation’, in the sense given to this term
by Bohr and Mottelson in connection with the description of nuclear spectra, including enhanced
transition operators and emergence of a shared intrinsic correlation structure.
In this case the
moment of inertia of the deformed state is essentially the rigid moment of inertia, ‘intrinsic’ states
being essentially degenerate.

Introduction.

Persistent matter currents in the multiply connected ring geometry have now been experimentally
realized and studied many times in connection with ultra cold bosonic gases[1, 2, 3] in order to explore
super ﬂuid properties of the underlying many-body system. The most salient feature present in all
cases is the ‘quantization of the persistent current with macroscopic values of the angular momentum’
which was dubbed macroscopic isomerism by Bohr and Mottelson more than 50 years ago[4], in
connection with the quantization and (meta-)stability of electric currents in superconductors. In the
case of the bosonic gases, the relevant ‘macroscopic’ values of the angular momentum L are (in units
of ¯h) the integer multiples of the number of particles N .

Such macroscopic quantization was long ago dealt with, in the Bose gas context, by F. Bloch[5].
This work appeared in the wake of related work on superconductivity[6] and is based on a detailed
analysis of the minimum energies involved in imparting given amounts of angular momentum to
the system ground state. The analysis was carried out in the context of a simple (one-dimensional)
microscopic quantum mechanical model, revived and extended more recently by several authors[7, 8, 9].
In particular, the occurrence of a quantum phase transition was pointed out in [7] in a study of

the ground state properties with attractive two-body eﬀective interactions. It was signalled by the
‘solitonic’ breaking of the rotational symmetry in an eﬀective mean ﬁeld approach, and corroborated by
the behavior of the ground state two-body correlation function obtained by diagonalizing the eﬀective
Hamiltonian in a Fock subspace with good particle number and total angular momentum.

Symmetries, such as rotational invariance, play a most important role in organizing the dynam-
ical properties of ﬁnite quantum many-body systems. However, is also well known that there are
many phenomenologically salient features which develop across the cleavage resulting from them. A
familiar example of this is the occurrence of rotational spectra in molecules and atomic nuclei which
involve subspaces of diﬀerent angular momenta, even though they are dynamically disjoint as a result
of rotational invariance. Such features are currently described in terms of the stability of certain
symmetry violating correlation properties, or ‘deformations’[10]. The resulting syndrome is in fact
the ﬁnite-system counterpart of the spontaneous breaking of symmetries which can occur in extended
systems.

In this work we study, as a function of angular momentum, the low energy quantal spectrum of
a dilute bosonic gas conﬁned to a quasi one-dimensional toroidal trap, assuming the usual zero-range
eﬀective two-body interaction based on the s-wave scattering length. This is done taking advantage
of the strictly ﬁnite nature of the system and adopting two independent approaches, namely a) us-
ing a variational treatment involving product states with possibly broken rotational symmetry while
constraining the mean value of the angular momentum per particle and b) by carrying out numerical
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in many-body subspaces of deﬁnite particle number and angular
momentum, built from the diﬀerent possible occupations of a restricted set of relevant single-particle
states. Both eﬀectively repulsive and attractive two-body interactions are considered. We ﬁnd in
both cases that the qualitative features of the system are at most weakly dependent on the number
of particles provided the eﬀective two body interaction strength is scaled with 1/N so as to preserve
the relative weight of the kinetic (one-body) and the interaction (two-body) dynamical ingredients at
ﬁxed trap geometry.

We ﬁnd that the eﬀect of repulsive eﬀective two-body interactions is essential for providing con-
ditions for macroscopic isomerism (or persistent current meta-stability) in the model[5, 11]. The
strengths prevailing in current realistic experimental situations are in fact orders of magnitude larger
as compared with threshold values obtained for several lowest values of L/N . Attractive two-body
eﬀective interactions are found to lead to the onset of a regime in which the excitation energies of the
lowest states of each successive value of the total angular momentum correspond to the energies of
an essentially rigid rotational band with the rigid moment of inertia. In this way, the quantum phase
transition pointed out in ref.
[7] appears as an yrast phenomenon associated to the emergence of a
correlation structure common to a family of states with diﬀerent values on the total angular momen-
tum. This is clearly akin to ‘deformation’ as found in connection with rotational spectra in nuclear
and molecular physics. We ﬁnd also that the correlation structure induced by attractive (repulsive)
two-body interactions strongly enhances (appreciably reduces) transition matrix elements involving a
one body angular momentum exchange operator along the yrast line and so will aﬀect decay rates for
processes dependent on such matrix elements. It should be kept in mind, however that observed decay
probabilities (as e.g.
in [2]) may well involve degrees of freedom beyond those of the present quasi
one-dimensional model.

This second quantized Hamiltonian commutes with the number operator N = Pm b†mbm. In each
of the Fock space sectors characterized by the particle number N (where N acts as the corresponding
multiple of the unit operator), it can be split into ‘center of mass’ and ‘intrinsic’ parts by introducing
the total angular momentum operator (in units of ¯h) Lz ≡ Pm m b†mbm, also a constant of motion,

and writing its kinetic energy part as

which can be easily veriﬁed to be algebraically equivalent to the kinetic energy term of eq. (4). The
center of mass part is clearly just the rigid rotational energy ¯h2L2
2N M R2 , which commutes both with the
intrinsic part Kint of the kinetic energy and with the potential energy term V . One has therefore

z

H = KCM + Hint

with

Hint = Kint + V.

(5)

Since the total angular momentum Lz is also a constant of motion, the stationary states of H and of
Hint can be chosen as states with good total angular momentum L.

3 The spectrum of Hint.

Here we brieﬂy review the results of F. Bloch [5] within the speciﬁc context of the Hamiltonian (1)
or (4). In view of the decomposition (5) of this Hamiltonian, the eigenvalues EL of states with total
angular momentum L can in turn be split as

EL =

¯h2L2
2N M R2 + e(L)

int

(6)

where the last term is an eigenvalue of the intrinsic Hamiltonian Hint also associated with the total
angular momentum L. The corresponding N -particle eigenstate can be expanded in the occupation
|0i, built on single particle states with good an-

number base vectors |{nm}N,Li ≡ Qm

Since the intrinsic Hamiltonian Hint depends only on relative angular momenta of particle pairs[13],
it follows that the vectors obtained from this expansion just by shifting all the single particle angular
momenta m by an integer l, i.e.

will have the same intrinsic energy, while the total angular momentum is shifted by lN , so that the
center of mass energy is ¯h2(L+lN )2
2N M R2 . This implies that the spectrum of Hint is periodic in L with period
N . Furthermore, invariance of the spectrum under the replacement of the base vectors |{nm}N,Li by
|{n−m}N,−Li guarantees that the L-dependence of the periodic intrinsic spectrum is also reﬂection
symmetric.
Of special relevance here is the set lowest eigen-energies for each value of the total angular mo-
mentum (the set of the so called yrast states, or the yrast line[12]). In view of the above properties,
the energy eigenvalues on this line will be given as the addition of the set of lowest intrinsic energies
for increasing values of the total angular momentum L (which is periodic in L with period N ) to the
the center of mass energy parabola ¯h2L2
2N M R2 . As argued in ref. [5] (see also ref. [11]), the occurrence of
minima along the yrast line at non vanishing values of the total angular momentum signals the exis-
tence of meta-stable states with persistent currents in the system when additional couplings allowing
for angular momentum and energy exchange between the system and the constraining environment.

4 Characterization of the yrast line I - variational approach.

In view of the general periodicity features just described, it is convenient to write the total angular
momentum L (in units of ¯h) as L = N (l + ν), l being the integer part of the ratio L/N and ν =
0, 1
N . In this way, it is easily ascertained that the intrinsic energies for a system of free
bosons in the ring are given by

They are independent of l, consistently with the periodicity of the intrinsic spectrum. One sees
moreover i) that the intrinsic yrast energies display cusp minima at the integer values of L, and ii)
that the only minimum of the yrast line (including the center of mass rotational energy) for the free
bosons occurs at L = 0.

In order to explore variationally the eﬀects of the eﬀective two body interaction on the yrast

energies we make use of the family of ‘condensate’ states[8]

and

|cl−1|2 + |cl|2 + |cl+1|2 = 1,

(8)

so that [A, A†] = 1. These states are used to obtain approximations to the yrast line energies associated
with angular momenta L = N (l + ν). The approximate energies are given by the value of the energy
functional hΨ|H|Ψi in the state |Ψi which minimizes this value under the constraint hΨ|Lz|Ψi = L,
which is expressed in terms of the amplitudes involved in the deﬁnition of A† as

The constraints (8) and (9) are taken into account by introducing the parameterization

and S ﬁxed), then the one- and two-body contributions to the energy functional will both scale with
N [14]. The fact that the energy functional depends on the phases of the variational parameters cj only
through the combination Φ is a consequence of invariance under the transformation αl+k → αl+k + kφ,
k = 0,±1, associated with the rotational invariance of H, together with invariance under a global
phase change αj → αj + φ, associated with the global gauge invariance of H. Note also that the

The last term of (11) is independent of l, implying the periodicity F int

This allows in particular to restrict further considerations to l = 0 only in connection with the intrinsic
part of the energy functional.

The global minima of the intrinsic energy functional are taken as variational approximations to

the intrinsic yrast energies, i. e.

An exception occurs for ν = 0, g > −0.5, in which case the minimum reduces to an ‘inﬁmum’ at
|c0| = limν→0+ | ¯c0(ν)| = 1. This inﬁmum appears in this domain of the coupling constant g as the
ν → 0 limit of actual absolute minima of the energy functional for non vanishing values of nu. This
behavior leads in fact to a cusp behavior of eint
A chart of the relevant minima of the intrinsic energy functional is shown in ﬁg. 1, and numerical
results for the variational intrinsic yrast energies are displayed in ﬁg. 2. For values of the coupling
constant g greater than -0.5 one gets the cusp minimum at ν = 0, which translates also to all integer

minimum at ν = 0 is typical for g > −0.5. Extending the plot to ν > 0.5 (or to ν < −0.5) by using periodicity
generates a cusp maximum at half-integer values of ν. This results from deterioration of the adopted variational
ansatz away from the integer values of the abscissa. Bottom: results obtained by numerical diagonalization,

For values of g smaller than −0.5, the absolute minima at ν = 0 have |c0|2 < 1 implying that in
this domain one has |c±1| 6= 0, so that the minimizer breaks the rotational symmetry. This signals
a quantum phase transition at g = −0.5, as pointed out in ref.
[7] in connection with the ground
(L = 0) state. Furthermore, as g is decreased below the transition value, calculated yrast intrinsic
energies become very weakly dependent on ν. Consequently, the yrast line essentially reduces in this
domain of values of g to a rotational band with the rigid moment of inertia. Further insight into the
yrast states in this phase will be drawn from results of the numerical diagonalization of the model
Hamiltonian (4), to be discussed below.

4.1 Persistent currents.

It was argued by Bloch[5] that the occurrence of minima at non vanishing values of the angular
momentum along the yrast line indicated meta-stability of the associated current against additional
couplings allowing for exchange of angular momentum between the system and its surroundings. The
above variational results show that such minima will in fact develop at integer values of L/N , albeit as
cusp minima, whenever the coupling parameter g is large enough to make the right-slope of the cusps
shown in ﬁg. 2 larger than the slope of the center of mass energy at the corresponding value of L/N .
Having in mind the periodicity and symmetry properties of the intrinsic yrast energies, it is in fact
easy to see that cusp minima will in this case appear in the yrast line itself. Quantitative predictions
of the values of g at which this happens for the three lowest integer values of L/N are shown in ﬁg. 3.
It is worth noting explicitly that the meta-stability criterion, based on the persistence of local yrast
minima in the present model, actually refers to what may be called ‘one-dimensional meta-stability’,
as it depends in an essential way on the assumption that the transverse degrees of freedom in the quasi-

and 3. In view of the periodicity and symmetry properties of the intrinsic energies, the intercepts indicate the
values of g above which cusp minima develop at these values of L/N , indicating meta-stability of the currents in
the sense proposed by Bloch[5]. The full line curve shows the corresponding results obtained by diagonalizing
the Hamiltonian (4) for N = 40, l = 0 and lb = 2 (5 single-particle states). The variational slopes have
been obtained numerically using an increment ∆ν = 1/40 to conform to the discreteness in the diagonalization
calculation.

one-dimensional system are eﬀectively frozen. However, a simple qualitative observation which can
be made concerning the L-values at which instabilities appear to become an experimentally limiting
factor for the observation of persistent currents[2, 3] is that they occur where the de Broglie wavelength
is no longer much larger than the transverse scale of the employed toroidal trap, which would allow
for the participation of additional degrees of freedom in the dynamics of angular momentum transfer.
Also, in these experiments, the values of the coupling constant g can be estimated to be of the order of
thousands, indicating persistence of ‘one-dimensional meta-stability’ for values of L up to about two
orders of magnitude above the largest reported observed value. A realistic appraisal of the decay of
the macroscopically quantized angular momentum of the persistent currents is therefore beyond the
bearings of the present model.

5 Characterization of the yrast line II - numerical diagonalization.

For not too large a number of particles the stationary states of the Hamiltonian (4) can be obtained
by direct numerical diagonalization in a truncated base of many-body state vectors. Taking advantage
of the fact that the total angular momentum is a constant of motion, one may consider for each value
of L the truncated base formed by the set of N -body state vectors

from the bottom up) and the corresponding L = 0 ground state energies per particle obtained by numerical
diagonalization for a range of values of N using the prescription (13). The many-body bases are constructed
from a set of single particle orbitals with l = 0 and lb = 2 (see (12)).

with l − lb ≤ m ≤ l + lb, Pm nm = N and Pm mnm = L. The value of l plays here the same role

as in eq. (8), i.e. shifting the central value of the selected band of 2lb + 1 single particle angular
momentum functions in order to optimize the base for the relevant value of L, taking into account the
periodicity and symmetry properties of the intrinsic spectrum. The nm are occupation numbers for
the single particle states m. We report on calculations involving values of N from 10 to 40, and bases
involving from 5 (lb = 2) to 11 (lb = 5) single-particle states. Due to the periodicity of the (non-trivial)
intrinsic spectrum, we set l = 0 without loss of generality. It is worth noting that, for a given number
of particles N , the truncation involved in the adoption of a given set of single particle states leads
to many-body subspaces with good L having diﬀerent dimensionalities, implying a small residual L
dependence of the truncation eﬀects on the many-body eigenfunctions and energy eigenvalues. The
latter are in any case variational upper bounds to the ‘true’ eigenvalues for each value of L.

The value of the eﬀective two-body interaction strength parameter Λ is always taken,

in the
numerical diagonalizations, to be related to the strength parameter g used in connection with the
variational treatment as

¯h2

(13)

with the understanding that diﬀerent particle numbers N are dealt with by adjusting Λ so as to keep
the value of g constant, as this will tend to preserve the ‘ground state phase diagram’ of the system as
N is varied. This is indeed an exact feature of the variational approach, but holds only approximately
when one carries out many-body diagonalizations, as shown explicitly in ﬁg. 4, which compares the
variational energy per particle for the L = 0 ground state evaluated variationally for some sample
values of g and the corresponding N -dependent energies per particle obtained by diagonalization in
many-body bases built on a set of single-particle orbitals with l = 0 and lb = 2.

Intrinsic yrast energies obtained in this way are shown in ﬁg. 2 together with the corresponding

9

variational results, showing the very good overall agreement of the two evaluations, even though the
diagonalization is performed for a small system (N = 10). It should be kept in mind that, in view
of the truncation of the base the reported yrast energy results actually provide upper bounds for the
‘actual’ yrast energies; and that, for results obtained using many-body bases constructed from a ﬁxed
set of single-particle orbitals, truncation eﬀects are apt to increase as one moves away from the cusp at
ν = 0. In particular, residual L−dependence of the intrinsic yrast energies eyr in the deformed domain
g < −0.5 is reduced as lb (i.e., the number of single-particle orbitals involved in the construction of
the many-body base vectors) is increased.
The predicted values of g at which the cusps generate yrast minima indicating the onset of meta-
stable currents at integer values of L/N can be read from the values of deyr(0)/dν shown as the full
line curve of ﬁg. 3. Comparison with the values obtained from the variational dashed curve reveal
that the truncated diagonalization results in deeper cusp minima, leading to smaller critical values of
g notably for L/N ≥ 2.

6 Probing correlated states.

The availability of correlated many-body yrast state vectors obtained from many-body diagonalizations
allows for further probing of the variational transition at g = −0.5. As found also in the variational
calculation, numerical diagonalizations in this domain reveal a regime in which the intrinsic yrast
energies become essentially independent of ν = L/N − l, the yrast line approaching a rotational band
whose moment of inertia is essentially the rigid moment of inertia. Note that the intrinsic energies
for diﬀerent values of ν correspond now to diagonalizations carried out in orthogonal many-body
subspaces, dynamically decoupled by symmetry. This suggests that the quantum phase transition
identiﬁed through the breaking of the rotational symmetry of the variational ground state is akin
to the onset of ‘intrinsic deformations’ in nuclear and molecular spectra displaying well developed
rotational bands.

As one way of scrutinizing this interpretation, one may take advantage of the good angular momen-
tum eigenstates resulting from the numerical diagonalization procedure in order to detect collective
behavior in appropriate transition matrix elements[10]. A simple and eﬀective choice in this connec-
tion is to evaluate matrix elements between successive yrast states of the angular momentum transfer
operator

T1 ≡

l+lb−1

Xm=l−lb(cid:16)b†m+1bm + b†mbm+1(cid:17) .

Matrix elements of this operator between yrast states for a range of values of the coupling strength
parameter g are shown in Fig. 5 for states with particle number N = 14. A strong enhancement
above the values involving just bosonic factors (which alone determine the matrix elements at g = 0)
sets in sharply in the deformed domain g < −0.5. For g > 0, on the other hand, the free particle
values are quenched by the correlations induced by the eﬀective two-body interaction. To the extent
that operators involving T1 are involved in the loss of angular momentum trough external couplings,
this provides an indication that this type of loss is hindered by the correlations induced by repulsive
two-body interactions.

factors and are respectively 14, 26, 36, 44, 50 54 and 56 for L = 0 to 6. The onset of the deformed phase for
g < −0.5 is accompanied by a large enhancement of these matrix elements.

As a second approach, one may use the numerical correlated eigenstates to evaluate appropriate

correlation functions. We focus in particular on the correlation functions

hΨEL|ψ†(ϕ)ψ†(ϕ′)ψ(ϕ′)ψ(ϕ)|ΨELi

TrhΨEL|ψ†ψ†ψψ|ΨELi

≡ ρ(2)

EL

(ϕ − ϕ′)

(14)

where the states |ΨELi are yrast states. Results for this function are shown in ﬁg. 6 for g = 1. and
for g = −1. While in the ﬁrst case there is a clear dependence on the value of the angular momentum
(together with some tendency to anti-correlation, as signaled by the relatively shallow minima at
ϕ − ϕ′ = 0), in the attractive case the correlation function is essentially independent on the value of
the angular momentum, being strongly peaked at ϕ − ϕ′ = 0 and dropping to very small values at
ϕ − ϕ′ = ±π consistently with the correlation expected as a result of the attractive character of the
eﬀective interaction.
The stiﬀness of the two-body correlation function with respect to changes of angular momentum

in the ‘deformed’ phase in fact leaves an imprint also in the one-body reduced density matrix

hΨEL|b†m′bm|ΨELi = ρ(1)

ELmm′ = hnim δmm′

whose eigenvalues, written as hnim, are the mean occupation numbers of the single particle orbitals
φm(ϕ). As illustrated in ﬁg. 7, in the deformed regime the eigenvalues of the one body density
for yrast states with diﬀerent angular momenta fall essentially on a single distribution curve, after
being translated by the fractional value of L/N . This is at variance with what one ﬁnds in the non-
deformed regime, where a considerable fraction of the particle number N is carried by the m = 0
orbital consistently with the relatively small anisotropy of the two-body correlation function in this
case.

Finally, one may consider the full ‘intrinsic wave functions’ χN,L(ϕ1, . . . , ϕN ) deﬁned by Bloch by
factoring out from the yrast wave functions ΨN,L ‘center of mass factors’ for the given number of
particles N and for each value of L, i. e.

ΨN,L(ϕ1, . . . , ϕN ) = ei L

ϕj χN,L(ϕ1, . . . , ϕN )

j=1

N PN

These intrinsic wave functions depend only on coordinate diﬀerences ϕj − ϕk and are therefore rota-
tionally invariant. They satisfy the ‘twisted’ boundary conditions

χN,L(ϕ1, . . . , ϕj + 2π, . . . , ϕN ) = e−2πi L

N χN,L(ϕ1, . . . , ϕj, . . . , ϕN ).

Since they are rotationally invariant, the intrinsic wave functions are eigenfunctions of the total angular
momentum with eigenvalue zero, so that they are also eigenfunctions of H with eigenvalue e(L)
int .

In order to access the intrinsic wave functions for each of the values of the total angular momentum
L within the second-quantization framework adopted here we ﬁrst consider the description of the
system in a frame of reference which rotates with angular velocity Ω about the axis of the toroidal
conﬁguration space. The corresponding Hamiltonian HΩ is related to H, as written in eq. (1), by
z → (lz − M RΩ/¯h)2 in the kinetic energy term. The terms involving Ω
making the replacement l2
may furthermore be eliminated by means the gauge transformation of the ﬁeld operators ψ(ϕ) ≡

Fig. 7: Logarithm (for clarity in the display of smaller values) of the mean single particle occupation numbers
hnim, for a system with N = 10 treated in the many-body base constructed from single-particle orbitals with
l = 0 and lb = 5 (see (12)), plotted against the single particle angular momentum m. The plot on top has been
calculated with a repulsive eﬀective interaction g = 2.0 and displays results for the L = 0 (ﬁlled circles, full line)
and L = 5 (L/N = 0.5, crosses, short-dashed line). The open circles connected by a long-dashed line are those
corresponding to L/N = 0.5 displaced by −0.5 along the m axis. The bottom graph shows the corresponding
plots for an attractive eﬀective interaction with g = −2.0. Unlike in the case of the repulsive interaction, here
the points obtained for L/N = 0.5, after translation by −0.5 along the m axis, essentially fall on the same curve
as the L = 0 occupations.

Particle number and the total angular momentum remain constants of motion.

When considering states with with N particles and total angular momentum L, the choice Ω →
ΩN L ≡ ¯hL/(N M R2) reduces the gauge term to just L/N . With this choice, in the N , L sector of the
Fock space the Hamiltonian HΩ reduces to to the form (4) with the b-operators replaced by twisted
β-operators, and with the subtraction of the center of mass energy ¯h2L2/(2N M R2). Thus, except

13

for the trivial subtraction of a multiple of the unit matrix related to the center of mass energy, it is
represented in the basis of twisted many-body state vectors vectors (cf. eq. (12))

This identiﬁes the numerical ground state in the twisted N , L sector as the yrast ‘intrinsic state’ for
the selected values of N and L. The ‘intrinsic states’ are therefore just of the form (7), with the same
coeﬃcients C (j)

The fact that they correspond to rotationally invariant amplitudes in conﬁguration space is borne out

by the fact that Pm nm(m − L/N ) = 0. It should be stressed that intrinsic states corresponding to

diﬀerent values of the total angular momentum L will not be orthogonal, since they are eigenvectors
of diﬀerently twisted Hamiltonians.

These rotationally invariant intrinsic yrast states can be used, in particular, to provide for indica-
tions concerning the nature of the quantum phase transition at g ≃ −0, 5. The simplest information
which may be derived from these non-orthogonal states is the content and hierarchy of the domain of
the many-body phase space spanned by them. For the purpose of obtaining it we take the set of yrast

Fig. 8: Top: Eigenvalues λn of the overlap matrix of many-body intrinsic states for N = 14, L = −7 to 6
as functions of the coupling strength g. The values plotted are normalized by the trace (P λn = 14) of the
overlap matrix. Bottom: Squared amplitudes along intrinsic states with diﬀerent L-values of the eigenvector
associated with the largest eigenvalue of the overlap matrix as functions of g. The numerical many-body
eigenstates used to generate the overlap matrix were evaluated using the full many-body base constructed in
terms of ﬁve single-particle orbitals with l = 0 and lb = 2 (see (12)).

associated eigenvalues λn, on the other hand, specify weights identifying the participation of each one
of the principal directions in the set of intrinsic states.

The eﬀect of the onset of deformation on the set of intrinsic states is borne out in terms of these
ingredients in Fig. 8. The upper part of this ﬁgure shows a plot of the relative weight of the largest
eigenvalue λ0 of the overlap matrix as function of the coupling constant g, while the lowest part plots
squared components |f (0)
L |2 of the eigenvector associated to the largest eigenvalue along the intrinsic
states. A clear transition is seen to occur in the spectrum of the overlap matrix when the value of
the coupling constant is reduced in the vicinity of g = −0.5. In the domain with stronger attractive
coupling a single state acquires dominance over the content of the intrinsic subspace, as revealed by
the fact that the corresponding eigenvalue exhausts an important fraction of the trace. This indicates

15

that the yrast states in the ‘deformed phase’, at g < −0.5, are at least strongly dominated by a single,
common many-body correlation function. A change of regime is also noted in the L-composition of
the dominant eigenvector, which becomes uniformly ﬂat in the ‘deformed’ region, as shown also in
Fig. 8. This indicates that the dominant, common intrinsic state is a nearly uniform superposition of
the intrinsic states for the various L-values present in the intrinsic yrast period.

The features shown in Fig. 8 for N = 14 particles are found also for smaller values on N , albeit
with a strengthening of the single state dominance. This may be attributed at least in part to
limitations imposed by the truncation of the twisted bases on the numerical evaluation of the many-
body intrinsic overlaps. Indeed the truncation is apt to fail to saturate the unitarity relations assumed
in the evaluation of the overlaps. Because of this, the calculated value of the dominant eigenvalue
should be considered as a lower bound.

7 Concluding remarks.

We have examined a particular realization of the one-dimensional model system considered long ago
by F. Bloch[5].
It involves ingredients drawn from current experimental and theoretical research
involving trapped, dilute atomic gases. In particular, the usual eﬀective contact two-body interaction
based on the atom-atom scattering length and its quasi one-dimensional reduction involving the trap
geometry have been explicitly used. The main focus is the quantum dynamics of ﬁnite many-body
systems, in which invariance under rotations and global gauge transformations play a fundamental
role in establishing relevant dynamic cleavages between subspaces of the many-body phase space with
diﬀerent values of total angular momentum and particle number.
In this context, the phenomena
of persistent, meta-stable currents and of ‘deformations’, as revealed by collective rotational features,
appear as emergent properties developing across the cleavages imposed by symmetry through the onset
of appropriate correlation properties. A natural domain hosting such emergence is the set of yrast
states, the lowest energy states for each value of the total angular momentum.

The properties of the yrast states resulting from a variational mean-ﬁeld approach allowing for
the control of the mean total angular momentum, which amounts to a restricted mean ﬁeld approxi-
mation, have been confronted to correlated many-body stationary states resulting from a many-body
diagonalization in truncated Fock subspaces with good particle number and angular momentum.

The eﬀects of a suﬃciently strong repulsive two-body eﬀective interactions appear in both cases
as essential for the generation of the yrast energy minima which can be associated with meta-stability
of persistent currents[5, 11]. The relevant minima appear as yrast cusps at values of the total angular
momentum which are integer multiples of the particle number. Threshold two-body interaction values
for the occurrence of actual minima at a given integer value of the total angular momentum per particle
become rather insensitive to particle number N when scaled by 1/N , as this maintains the balance of
the kinetic and interaction eﬀects in the eﬀective Hamiltonian.

In the case of attractive two-body eﬀective interactions, and within the variational restricted mean-
ﬁeld approach, the ‘quantum phase transition’ pointed out in ref. [7] manifests itself, as usual, in terms
of a self-consistence related breaking of the rotational symmetry of the ground state. This is moreover
accompanied by the disappearance of the yrast cusps, which are replaced by analytic, locally quadratic
yrast minima together with the overall ﬂattening of the intrinsic yrast energies. This behavior of the
intrinsic yrast energies is borne out also in the case of the diagonalization results. Since they rely on the

16

use of subspaces of good particle number and angular momentum, properties related to the quantum
phase transition must be sought in the correlation properties of many-body states. In fact not only
the behavior of two-body correlation functions of the yrast states undergoes profound changes as one
crosses the transition region, but further standard characteristics of collective ‘deformations’[10] also
arise there. In fact we ﬁnd both a strong ‘collective’ enhancement of transition matrix elements of a
one-body angular momentum transfer operator acting between neighboring members of the yrast line
and the emergence of a weighty common eigen-component in the many-body subspace generated by the
intrinsic yrast states. The individual intrinsic yrast states are themselves rather uniformly represented
in this common eigen-component, as can be seen in ﬁgure 8. The full ‘deformation syndrome’, present
notably in the dynamics of the much more complex molecular and nuclear systems, appears thus to
be deployed in the present one-dimensional model. The simplicity of the model makes the associated
correlation structures more accessible to detailed scrutiny.
