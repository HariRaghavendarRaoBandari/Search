Abstract

We present a description of the production of di-lepton pair production (through Z boson
and virtual photon) in association with at least two jets. This calculation adds to the ﬁxed-
order accuracy the dominant logarithms in the limit of large partonic centre-of-mass energy
to all orders in the strong coupling αs. This is achieved within the framework of High Energy
Jets. This calculation is made possible by extending the high energy treatment to take into
account the multiple t-channel exchanges arising from Z and γ∗-emissions oﬀ several quark
lines. The correct description of the interference eﬀects from the various t-channel exchanges
requires an extension of the subtraction terms in the all-order calculation. We describe this
construction and compare the resulting predictions to a number of recent analyses of LHC
data. The description of a wide range of observables is good, and, as expected, stands out
from other approaches in particular in the regions of large dijet invariant mass and large
dijet rapidity spans.

Introduction

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) sheds ever more light on Standard Model processes at higher
energies as it continues into Run II. One “standard candle” process for the validation of the
Standard Model description in this new energy regime is the production of a dilepton pair through
an intermediate Z boson or photon, in association with (at least) two jets [1–7]. This ﬁnal state
can be entirely reconstructed from visible particles (in contrast to pp → dijets plus(W →)eν)
making it a particularly clean channel for studying QCD radiation in the presence of a boson.
Experimentally, this process is indistinguishable from the production of a virtual photon which
has decayed into the same products, and we will consider both throughout.
W and Z/γ∗-production are excellent benchmark processes for investigating QCD corrections,
since the mass of the boson provides a perturbative scale, while the event rates allow for jet selec-
tion criteria similar to those applied in Higgs boson studies. W, Z/γ∗-production in association
with dijets is of particular interest, since in many respects it behaves like a dijet production emit-
ting a weak boson (i.e. electroweak corrections to a QCD process rather than QCD corrections to
a weak process). This observation means that a study of W, Z/γ∗-production in association with
dijets is relevant for understanding Higgs-boson production in association with dijets (which in
the gluon-fusion channel can be viewed as a Higgs-boson correction to dijet production). This
process is interesting (e.g. for CP -studies) in the region of phase space with large dijet invariant
mass, where the coeﬃcients in the perturbative series have logarithmically large contributions
to all orders. As an example of the increasing importance of the higher orders, it is noted that
the experimental measurement of the (N + 1)/N-jet rate in Z/γ∗+jets increases from 0.2 to 0.3
after application of very modest VBF-style selection cuts even at 7 TeV [1, 2, 4].
The current state-of-the-art for ﬁxed-order calculations for this process is the next-to-leading
order calculation of Z/γ∗ plus 4 jets by the BlackHat collaboration [8]. While it has become
standard to merge next-to-leading order QCD calculations with parton showers [9–14], results
for jet production in association with vector bosons have so far only appeared with up to two

2

jets [15, 16]. Indeed, W/Z + 0−, 1− and 2−jet NLO samples have been merged with higher-
multiplicity tree-level matrix elements and parton shower formulations [17, 18]. However, a
parton shower cannot be expected to accurately provide a description of multiple hard jets from
its resummation of the (soft and collinear) logarithms which are enhanced in the region of small
invariant mass. An alternative method to describe the higher-order corrections is instead to sum
the logarithmic corrections which are enhanced at large invariant mass between the particles.
This is the approach pioneered by the High Energy Jets (HEJ) framework [19,20]. Here, the hard-
scattering matrix elements for a given process are supplemented with the leading-logarithmic
corrections (in s/t) at all orders in αs. This approach has been seen to give a good description
of dijet and W plus dijet data at both the TeVatron [21] and the LHC [22–26]. In particular,
these logarithmic corrections ensure a good description of W plus dijet-production in the region
of large invariant mass between the two leading jets [26] and in large invariant mass regions in a
recent 4-jet ATLAS study [27]. It is not surprising that standard methods struggle in the region
of large invariant mass, since the perturbative coeﬃcients receive large logarithmic corrections to
all orders, and perturbative stability is guaranteed only once these are systematically summed.

The purpose of this paper is to develop the treatment of such large QCD perturbative corrections
within High Energy Jets to include the process of Z/γ∗ plus dijets. While this process has many
features in common with the W plus dijets process, one major diﬀerence is the importance of
interference terms, both between diﬀerent diagrams within the same subprocess (e.g. qQ →
qQ(Z →)e+e− with emissions oﬀ either the q or Q line) and between Z and γ∗ processes of
the same partonic conﬁguration. For processes with two quark lines, the possibility to emit
the Z/γ∗ from both of these leads to profound diﬀerences to the formalism, since the t-channel
momentum exchanged between the two quark lines obviously diﬀers depending on whether the
boson emission is oﬀ line q or Q. Furthermore, the interference between the two resulting
amplitudes necessitates a treatment at the amplitude-level. High Energy Jets is formulated at
the amplitude-level, which, together with the matching to high-multiplicity matrix-elements,
sets it apart in the ﬁeld of high energy logarithms [28–36]. The added complication over the
earlier High Energy Jets-formalism (and indeed in any BFKL-related study) by the interfering
t-channels introduces a new structure of divergences in both real and virtual corrections, and
therefore a new set of subtraction terms are needed, in order to organise the cancellation of
these divergences. The matching to full high-multiplicity matrix elements puts the ﬁnal result
much closer to those of ﬁxed order samples merged according to the shower formalism [15–18] —
although of course the logarithms systematically controlled with High Energy Jets are diﬀerent
to those controlled in the parton shower formalism. In particular, High Energy Jets remains a
partonic generator, i.e. although it is an all-order calculation (like a parton shower), it is not
interfaced to a hadronisation model. Initial steps in combining the formalism of High Energy
Jets and that of a parton shower (and hadronisation) were performed in Ref. [37].

We begin the main body of this article by outlining the construction of a High Energy Jets am-
plitude and its implementation in a fully ﬂexible parton level Monte Carlo in the next section.
In section 3 we derive the new subtraction terms which allows us to fully account for interfer-
ence between the amplitudes. The subtraction terms allow for the construction of the all-order
contribution to the process as an explicit phase-space integral over any number of emissions.

where σ is the sought-after cross section, and the rest of the equation is discussed in the relevant
section. Section 3 also discusses the necessary modiﬁcations in order to include ﬁxed-order match-
ing. In section 4 we show and discuss the comparisons between the new predictions obtained
with High Energy Jets and LHC data. We conclude and present the outlook in section 5.

2 The High Energy Limit of QCD and Real Corrections

Fadin and Lipatov observed [28, 29] that QCD scattering amplitudes at large invariant mass
(compared to the transverse momenta involved) exhibit the scaling expected from Regge-theory.
In particular, this means that for a given conﬁguration of the transverse momenta in a 2 → n-
scattering, the limiting behaviour of the scattering amplitude as the invariant mass between
each pair of partons increases is dictated by the maximum spin of any particle, which could
be exchanged in what is termed the t-channel between partons neighbouring in rapidity. This
is found by ordering both initial and ﬁnal state particles according to rapidity (or light-cone
momenta in the case of incoming particles), and drawing all possible colour connections between
these. If a colour octet connection is allowed between pairs of particles, this corresponds to the
possibility of a spin-1 gluon exchange, whereas colour-triplet exchange is identiﬁed as a spin-1/2
quark exchange.
The contribution to the cross section from a given momentum conﬁguration of the jets (as
opposed to partons) from the diﬀerent ﬂavour assignments will have a diﬀerent limiting behaviour,
since the large invariant-mass scaling is diﬀerent e.g. in the process of qg → qg, if the rapidity
ordering of the ﬁnal state q and g is swapped. Considering a speciﬁc transverse momentum
conﬁguration of the jets in a simple 2 → 2-process, the full amplitude (which will then be
squared in the calculation of the cross section) will scale as sω, where s is the invariant mass
of the ﬁnal jets and ω is the spin of the particle which would be exchanged in the t-channel.
Some cases, e.g. gg → gg, always allow for a gluon to be exchanged, and hence the amplitude
scales as s1 for large s. In other cases, e.g. qg → qg, the t-channel particle exchanged is either
a quark or a gluon depending on the rapidity order of the ﬂavour assignment, and hence the
amplitude scales as s1/2 or s1 for large s. However, in this case, it is clear that in the limit of
large s the contribution to the resulting jet momentum conﬁguration will be dominated by the
process with the gluon exchange. This discussion is illustrated further in Fig. 1. This argument
may be further generalised to the case of more than two outgoing partons, where now a 2 → n
amplitude scales as

|M| ∝ sω1

12 . . . sωn−1

(n−1)n Γ({ti}),

(1)

where the outgoing particles are ordered in rapidity, sij is the invariant mass of particles i and
j and ωi is the spin of the particle exchanged in the t-channel of neighbouring particles. Γ({ti})
depends only on the square of the t-channel momenta (which in the limit corresponds to minus
the square of their transverse components).

4

Figure 1: The two lines above illustrate the two possible rapidity orders for the process qg → qg.
In the ﬁrst case, where the rapidity of the gluon is greater than the quark, the allowed colour
connection is a singlet corresponding to a quark exchange in the t-channel. This leads to a
contribution to the amplitude which scales as s1/2.
In the second case, the allowed colour
connection is an octet which corresponds to a gluon exchange in the t-channel and a scaling of
s1. The latter will clearly be the dominant conﬁguration in the limit of large s.

We have thus identiﬁed the ﬂavour-assignments of partons which will yield the dominant con-
tribution in the limit of large invariant mass between the jets, for any given conﬁguration of
the transverse momenta: the dominant contribution is obtained in the ﬂavour conﬁgurations
which allow for colour-octet (gluon) exchanges between all neighbouring particles. We call these
“FKL conﬁgurations”. Within High Energy Jets we concentrate on describing to all orders in the
strong coupling these scattering amplitudes, which contribute to the leading power behaviour of
the cross section.

These scaling arguments are unaﬀected by the additional emission of an electroweak boson and
speciﬁcally here we discuss the description with an additional Z boson or virtual photon. The
emission of an electroweak boson is viewed merely as an electroweak correction to the underlying
QCD dijet production.

We begin by considering qg-initiated processes where the quark is the backward-moving incoming
parton and take the leptonic decay of the Z/γ∗. The ordering described above motivates a unique
deﬁnition of t-channel momenta, namely if pa is the momentum of the backward quark, pb is
the momentum of the forward gluon and y1 (cid:28) y2 (cid:28) ... (cid:28) yn, one then deﬁnes ti = q2
i , where
q1 = pa − p1 − p(cid:96)+ − p(cid:96)− and qi = qi−1 − pi for 2 ≤ i ≤ n. Furthermore, the leading contribution,
which satisﬁes the requirement of maximal t-channel gluon exchanges, arises purely from the
outgoing state where all of the intermediate particles in rapidity (those labelled 2 to n− 1) must
be gluons. As discussed later, the factorisation property of amplitudes in the high-energy limit
then allows us to describe the emission of each of these gluons with an independent eﬀective
emission vertex, a generalised Lipatov vertex V µ [19], multiplying the corresponding expression

scribed in full detail in section 2.3. While pa +pb (cid:54)= p(cid:96)− +p(cid:96)+ +p1 +pn for n > 2, the expression is
built of two independent factorised pieces, so this is not a problem. Care needs to be taken with
the expression for the t-channel pole, which must be taken symmetrically as 1/t2 = 1/(t1tn−1).
If the quark is instead the forward moving incoming parton, the expression is identical except
for the deﬁnition of q1 where the lepton momenta is removed.
For other initial states contributing to Z/γ∗ plus dijets, however, the situation is more compli-
cated. In particular for qQ-initiated processes, as the Z/γ∗ may be emitted from either quark
line, and there is interference from the two possibilities of exchanged t-channel momenta. The
eﬀective emission vertex remains valid, but we must now work at amplitude level to take into
account this interference, both here and for the virtual corrections as described in section 3. In
the remainder of this section we will develop the equivalent of eq. (2) for all channels of Z/γ∗
plus dijets. We begin this in the next subsection, by describing our method of constructing

2.1 Writing Matrix Elements in Terms of Currents

Traditionally, amplitudes in the HE limit are described as a product of two scalar “impact factors”,
one for each end of the t-channel chain. Instead, in HEJ, we describe the core 2 → X +2 processes

6

Vµ2Vµ3Vµn−1papbp1pnpn−1p3p2in terms of a contraction of two independent currents. This is inspired by the structure of the
exact tree-level amplitudes, where each quark line automatically generates a current. Eﬀectively,
helicity currents allow for the distinction of the kinematic invariants s and u, which is lost in the
standard high-energy factorisation at the cross-section level. This distinctions proves necessary in
retaining accuracy in the approximations. This can already be illustrated in the simple example
of qQ → qQ. For all negative helicities for example, one can immediately write:

iMq−Q−→q−Q− = ig2

where we have employed the spinor-helicity notation for the quark spinors, where (cid:104)i|µ|j(cid:105) is
shorthand for ¯u−(pi)γµu−(pj). The repeated colour index d is summed over and the lower colour
indices refer to their respective particle.
We will work in lightcone coordinates p± = E ± pz and further deﬁne p⊥ = px + ipy and
eiφ = p⊥/|p⊥|. In components, we get (using the spinors parametrised as in Ref. [19])

This correctly captures the leading behaviour in s/t and gives a factorised expression.
However, by using helicity-currents, it is possible to achieve a form of factorisation without
relying on kinematic approximations. Returning to eq. (4), it may immediately be written as a
contraction of two factorised four-vectors: V (pa, p1).V (pb, p2), where the vectors depend on the
same momenta as the factorised vertices in the traditional approach, but now the vectors (up to
constants) are just standard currents j−µ(pi, pj) = (cid:104)i|µ|j(cid:105):

Each helicity current has two independent components and this extra degree of freedom compared
to the impact factors of the traditional approach is precisely what is required in order to keep
the ﬁrst term in eq. (5) and therefore describe the amplitude exactly.
This illustration is clearly for a very simple process, but the same conclusion applies more
generally. One can exactly describe qg → qg as the contraction of a standard quark current
and a gluon current jg
µ, consisting of a product of a standard quark current and colour factors
depending on the gluon momenta only [20]. This holds even though the qg-scattering process
has s, t and u-singularities. The same holds for gg → gg as long as the helicities of the two
incoming (and outgoing) gluons diﬀer, such that one can deﬁne the s, t, u-channels. One can also
go beyond pure QCD and describe qQ → W q(cid:48)Q, qQ → Z/γ∗qQ and qQ → qQH exactly as the
contraction of two currents [19]. In the next subsection we describe the new current for Z/γ∗
plus jets, and the construction of the resulting amplitude.

1Our spinor conventions diﬀer by a phase to those in Ref. [38] which vanishes in the matrix-element squared.

2.2 A Current for Z/γ∗ plus Jets
In this section, we will construct a current to describe the emission of a Z/γ∗ boson and exchange
of a t-channel gluon from a quark or antiquark line. We can write the current for the Z emission
(only), jµ
Z, as a sum of the contributions from the two possible emission sites: one where the
Z is emitted before the t-channel gluon and another where the gluon is radiated ﬁrst, shown
diagramatically in ﬁgure 3. For deﬁniteness, we could then consider the decay Z → e+e−. We
have

quark and lepton momenta using their completeness relations we can ﬁx the helicity of the
incoming quark, hin, and the outgoing quark, hout, to be identical, and we are left with a current
which only has four possible helicity conﬁgurations depending on hq = hin = hout and the

For the charged lepton channels for Z-decays, we must also include the contribution arising from
the exchange of an oﬀ-shell photon, γ∗. The expression for the current for the oﬀ-shell photon
has the same form to that shown in eq. (9) with the Z propagator replaced with that of the

With the current derived in the previous subsection, we have the required building blocks to
describe the dominant contribution to the real emission in the HE limit, in the manner of
eq. (2). We ﬁrst construct the lowest order description, |MHE

is already the sum of diagrams with a mediating Z and diagrams with a mediating γ∗. For the
(cid:88)
quark-gluon initiated processes, this is then all we need for the complete amplitude and we write:

2. Our current, jZ/γ∗

(11)
The interference term between the Z and γ∗ processes is immediately included in this construction
through squaring the sum of Eq. (10). The equivalent expressions for the gq-initial state and for
¯qg and g ¯q-initial states all have the same simple form. This can then be substituted into eq. (2)
to give the real corrections up to any order in αs.
We now turn our attention to the case of two incoming quark lines (or a mix of quark and
anti-quarks). Here, it is possible for the Z to be emitted from either quark line, and it turns
out that the interference eﬀects are sizeable, see Fig. 4. We must include both possibilities and
allow for the interference term. Our high-energy description of the matrix elements relies on
the correct description of the t-channel momenta, and this obviously depends on which of the
quark lines the Z or γ∗ was emitted from. We therefore need to modify the simple framework
outlined above. We will use the subscript a (b) to label the current at the lowest (highest) end
of the rapidity chain. We then deﬁne ta (tb) to be the t-channel momentum exchanged when the
bosons are emitted at the lowest (highest) end of the rapidity chain. Then the full amplitude

where ja,b are the pure quark currents deﬁned above eq. (7). The coupling constants of the Z to
the relevant quarks and leptons are contained within jZ/γ∗
(hq, he), as in eq. (8). Fig. 4 shows the
value of this matrix element squared divided by the squared partonic centre-of-mass energy for
increasing rapidity separation of the two jets. The result is compared with that obtained from
the full, tree-level matrix elements from MadGraph5 [14]. The slice through phase space here is

the two outgoing partons grows large. This is as expected from BFKL and Regge theory. Fig. 4
also shows the separate contributions to the total matrix element squared coming from the Z/γ∗
emission from the forward moving quark line (black, dashed) and emission from the backward
moving quark line (green, dotted). In this phase space slice, the leptons also have an increasing
positive rapidity and so the forward emission matrix element describes the full matrix element
most closely, with the contribution from backward-emission falling at large values of ∆y. The sum
of the forward and backward emission matrix elements neglecting interference (magenta, dotted)
signiﬁcantly overestimates the ﬁnal result. Once the (destructive) interference eﬀects have been
taken into account, the full sum (red, solid) correctly reproduces the LO matrix element (blue,
thick solid). It is therefore clear that at low rapidities the inclusion of the interference eﬀect plays
an important role in the accuracy of the matrix element. Neither this eﬀect nor the interference
between the Z and γ∗ channels is included when electroweak corrections are included in a parton
shower [39–41].

One can also investigate the importance of the virtual photon contributions we include and their
interference with the pure Z process. The inclusion of the virtual photon terms is particularly
important when studying a combined lepton invariant mass, (pe+ + pe−)2, far from the Z mass
peak. This can be seen in Fig. 5, where slices through phase space are shown similarly to Fig. 4,
but now for an (a) lower and (b) higher value of the dilepton mass. In both cases, the contribution
of the virtual photon processes is above 25%.
Having established our description of the 2 → Z/γ∗ +2 parton process, we now turn our attention
to adding the all-order real corrections. Our all-order expression will take the form of a sum of
terms like eq. (2) for each of the three terms in eq. (12), such that the squared matrix element

tree-level contribution as described in HEJ (red, dashed) exactly matches that of Madgraph
(blue, solid). The terms corresponding to the production of a Z boson only (green, dotted)
signiﬁcantly undershoots the full result. The virtual photon terms are, therefore, clearly an
important contribution to the matrix element away from the Z Breit-Wigner peak.

In the case of n = 2, this reduces back to eq. (12). If either a or b is an incoming gluon, there
is once again a unique set of t-channel momenta and one can set the relevant jZ/γ∗

We therefore have a compact expression for the real-emission contribution to a given process at
any order in αs. All real corrections can then be added by summing over n ≥ 2, provided that
each contribution is ﬁnite. We will organise the cancellation of singularities using a phase-space
slicing method which we describe in the next section.

3 Virtual Corrections and the Cancellation of Divergences

In the previous section, we derived a description for the dominant real emission corrections in the
HE limit for a given process contributing to Z/γ∗ plus jets. Here we describe the corresponding
virtual corrections and the organisation of the cancellation of divergences.

For a general QCD amplitude, the Lipatov Ansatz gives an elegant prescription for the leading
logarithmic and next-to-leading logarithmic terms of the virtual corrections in the HE limit [28].
Each t-channel pole is supplemented with the following exponential factor:

where qi⊥ is the transverse components of the relevant t-channel momentum and we have used
dimensional regularisation with d = 4 + 2ε. Given the diﬀerent ‘t’s which enter the diﬀerent
terms of eq. (14), it is clear we must now also calculate the virtual corrections in three separate

terms. We deﬁne ∆yi = yi+1−yi and then incorporate the all-order virtual corrections as follows:

To ﬁnd the physical result (cross section, distributions, etc.), we now need to integrate over
n-particle phase space and then sum over all n ≥ 2. However, before it is possible to do that,
we must ﬁrst organise the cancellation of divergences. There are two sources of divergences in
eq. (16): the poles in ε within the virtual corrections and, upon integration over all phase space,
the divergences which arise from any of the parton momenta going to zero. We do not have
collinear singularities in our description, because by construction the particles are assumed to be
well-separated.
We will use a phase space slicing method in which we divide the available phasespace into two
regions by the introduction of a cut-oﬀ scale λcut on p2⊥. Above the cut-oﬀ, we consider the
emissions ‘hard’ and below the cut-oﬀ, we consider them to be ‘soft’.
The divergence arising from the emission of a soft gluon can be seen directly from the eﬀective
vertex given in eq. (3). In the limit p2

i⊥ → 0, we ﬁnd

where we have used a change of variables from pz to rapidity. We will eventually go on to
integrate over the momenta of all other particles, but the cancellation occurs already at the

as the ﬁnite remainder from the cancellation. These results are valid for any emission between
the outer quarks/gluons which becomes soft. If either of the outer quarks/gluons becomes soft,
this will also produce a divergence. To remain within the perturbative framework, we require
that the outer particles are constituents of the jets and that their transverse momentum is above
a minimum value.

It is clear that this result can be iterated order by order in αs. We would then form our ﬁnal

One can easily check by expansion that this correctly reproduces the results in eqs. (23)–(25).
However, the limit we have used from eq. (17) is a limit and not an exact identity. We therefore
have to account for the diﬀerence between −V 2(qi−1, qi)/(ti−1ti) and its strict limit of 4/p2
i⊥
for values of pi⊥ below λcut. In practice, we include this correction for ccut < |p⊥| < λcut with

15

ccut = 0.2 GeV and ﬁnd stable results around this value. We demonstrate that our numerical
results are also insensitive to the precise value of λcut in appendix A.
A total (diﬀerential) cross section can then be obtained by summing over all values of n and
integrating over the full n-particle phase space, using an eﬃcient Monte Carlo sampling algo-

mum requirement is that the ﬁnal state momenta cluster into at least two jets for the desired

However,
qQ→Z/γ∗q(n−2)gQ|2 will become more signiﬁcant. We can therefore further improve upon
eq. (28) by matching our results to ﬁxed order results. Here, we match to high-multiplicity
tree-level results obtained from Madgraph5 [14] in two diﬀerent ways. This amounts to merging
tree-level samples of diﬀerent orders according to the logarithmic prescription of HEJ.

|MHEJ−reg

1. Matching for FKL conﬁgurations

As described in section 2, these are the particle assignments and momentum conﬁgurations
which contain the dominant leading-logarithmic terms in s/t. The ﬁrst step of the HEJ
description was to develop an approximation to the matrix element for these processes
which was later supplemented with the ﬁnite correction which remained after cancelling
2 (eq. (14)). The
the real and virtual divergences:
approximation is necessary to allow us to describe the matrix element for any (and in
particular, large) n and for including both the leading real and virtual corrections. However,
if the parton momenta cluster into four or fewer jets3, the full tree-level matrix element
remains calculable. In these cases, we perform the matching multiplicatively, so we multiply
the integrand of eq. (28) by

(29)

Here, {j(cid:48)
i} are the jet momenta after a small amount of reshuﬄing. This is necessary
because the evaluation of the tree-level matrix elements assumes that the jet momenta are
both on-shell and have transverse momenta which sum to zero, neither of which is true in
general for our events due to the presence of extra emissions. Our reshuﬄing algorithm [45]
redistributes this extra transverse momentum in proportion to the size of the transverse
momentum of each jet. The plus and minus light-cone components are then adjusted such

that the jet is put on-shell and the rapidity remains unaltered. This last feature ensures
that after reshuﬄing the event is still in an FKL conﬁguration.

After this multiplicative matching factor has been included, the regularisation then pro-
ceeds as before.

2. Matching for non-FKL conﬁgurations

Away from regions in phase space where the quarks and gluons are well-separated, the non-
FKL conﬁgurations will play a more signiﬁcant rôle. These have so far not been accounted
for at all, and hence we add three exclusive samples of leading-order two-jet, three-jet and
four-jet leading-order events to our resummed events. The distinction between the samples
is made following the choice of jet algorithm and parameters.

These two matching schemes complete our description of the production of Z/γ∗ with at least two
jets, including the leading high-energy logarithms at all orders in αs. In the next two sections,
we compare the predictions from this formalism to LHC data.

4 Comparisons to LHC Data

We now compare the results of the formalism described in the previous sections to data. We

event, but the event itself is kept provided there are a suﬃcient number of other jets present.
Throughout, the central value of the HEJ predictions has been calculated with factorisation and
renormalisation scales set to µF = µR = HT /2, and the theoretical uncertainty band has been
determined by varying these independently by up to a factor of 2 in each direction (removing
the corners where the relative ratio is greater than two). Also shown in the plots taken from
the ATLAS paper are theory predictions from Alpgen [46], Sherpa [17, 47], MC@NLO [9] and
BlackHat+Sherpa [8, 48]. We will also comment on the recent theory description of Ref. [18].

In Fig. 6 we begin this set of comparisons with predictions and measurements of the inclusive jet
rates. HEJ and most of the other theory frameworks give a reasonable description of these rates.
The MC@NLO prediction drops below the data because it only contains the hard-scattering
matrix element for Z/γ∗ production and relies on a parton shower for additional emissions
beyond the one hard jet. The HEJ predictions have a larger uncertainty band which largely
arises from the use of leading-order results in the matching procedures.

We will now discuss a number of the diﬀerential distributions. In Ref. [4] these are displayed
as normalised distributions. However, given the excellent agreement of HEJ with data for the
inclusive 2-jet cross section, the HEJ predictions show good agreement without a normalisation
factor. Furthermore, including one has no impact on the quality of the agreement between HEJ
and data and so we choose not to include one. The ﬁrst diﬀerential distribution we consider
here is the distribution of the invariant mass between the two hardest jets, Fig. 7. The region of
large invariant mass is particularly important because this is a critical region for studies of vector
boson fusion (VBF) processes in Higgs-plus-dijets, and as previously discussed, the corrections
arising from QCD are similar in both processes: The radiation patterns are largely universal
between these processes, so one can test the quality of theoretical descriptions in Z/γ∗-plus-
dijets and use these to inform the Hjj-analyses. It is also a distribution which will be studied
to try to detect subtle signs of new physics. In this study, HEJ and the other approaches all
give a good description of this variable out to 1 TeV, with HEJ being closest throughout the
range. The merged sample of Ref. [18] (Fig. 9 in that paper) combined with the Pythia8 parton
shower performs reasonably well throughout the range with a few deviations of more than 20%,
while that combined with Herwig++ deviates badly. In a recent ATLAS analysis of W -plus-
dijet events [26], the equivalent distribution was extended out to 2 TeV and almost all of the
theoretical predictions deviated signiﬁcantly while the HEJ prediction remained ﬂat. This is one
region where the high-energy logarithms, included only in HEJ, are expected to become large.
In Fig. 8, we show the comparison of various theoretical predictions to the distribution of the
absolute rapidity diﬀerence between the two leading jets. It is clear in the left plot that HEJ
gives an excellent description of this distribution. This is to some extent expected as high-energy
logarithms are associated with rapidity separations. However, this variable is only the rapidity
separation between the two hardest jets which is often not representative of the total rapidity
‘length’ of events with more than two hard jets, since the hardest jets tend to central in rapidity.
Nonetheless, the HEJ description also performs well in this restricted scenario. The next-to-
leading order (NLO) calculation of Blackhat+Sherpa also describes the distribution quite well
while the other merged, ﬁxed-order samples deviate from the data at larger values. The merged
samples of Ref. [18] (Fig. 8 in that paper) describe this distribution well for small values of this
variable up to about 3 units when combined with Herwig++ and for most of the range when
combined with the Pythia8 parton shower, only deviating above 5 units.
The ﬁnal distribution in this section is that of the ratio of the transverse momentum of the
second hardest jet to the hardest jet. The perturbative description of HEJ does not contain
any systematic evolution of transverse momentum and this can be seen where its prediction
undershoots the data at low values of pT 2/pT 1. However, for values of pT 2 (cid:38) 0.5pT 1, the ratio of
the HEJ prediction to data is extremely close to 1. The ﬁxed-order based predictions shown in
Fig. 6 are all fairly ﬂat above about 0.2, but the ratio to the data diﬀers by about 10% for the
Blackhat+Sherpa and Sherpa predictions.

We now compare to data from a CMS analysis of events with a Z/γ∗ boson produced in as-
sociation with jets [5]. We show, for comparison, the plots from that analysis which contain
theoretical predictions from Sherpa [17, 47], Powheg [49] and MadGraph+Pythia [14]. The cuts
used for this analysis are summarised in table 2.

Table 2: Cuts applied to theory simulations in the CMS Z-plus-jets analysis results shown in
Figs. 10–12.

As in the previous section, any jet which failed the ﬁnal jet-lepton isolation cut was removed
from the event, but the event itself is kept provided there are a suﬃcient number of other jets
present. The main diﬀerence to these cuts and those of ATLAS in the previous section is that the
jets are required to be more central; |y| < 2.4 as opposed to |y| < 4.4. This allows less room for
evolution in rapidity; however, as we will see, HEJ predictions are still relevant in this scenario.
Once again, the central values are given by µF = µR = HT /2 with theoretical uncertainty bands
determined by varying these independently by factors of two around this value. HEJ events
always contain a minimum of two jets and therefore here we only compare to the distributions
for an event sample with at least two jets or above.

We begin in Fig. 10 by showing the inclusive jet rates for these cuts. The HEJ predictions give a
good description, especially for the 2- and 3-jet inclusive rates in this narrower phase space. The
uncertainty bands are larger for HEJ than for the Sherpa and Powheg predictions due to our LO
matching prescription (the scale variation for the results of Madgraph+Pythia is not shown).

In Figs. 11–12, we show the transverse momentum distributions for the second and third jet
respectively (the leading jet distribution was not given for inclusive dijet events). Beginning
with the second jet in Fig. 11, we see that the HEJ predictions overshoot the data at large
transverse momentum. In this region, the non-FKL matched components of the HEJ description
become more important and these are not controlled by the high-energy resummation. The HEJ
predictions are broadly similar to Powheg’s Z-plus-one-jet NLO calculation matched with the
Pythia parton shower.
In contrast, Sherpa’s prediction signiﬁcantly undershoots the data at
large transverse momentum. Here the Madgraph+Pythia prediction gives the best description
of the data.

Fig. 12 shows the transverse momentum distribution of the third jet in this data sample. Here,
the ratio of the HEJ prediction to data shows a linear increase with transverse momentum (until
the last bin where all the theory predictions show the same dip). Both the Sherpa and Powheg
predictions show similar deviations for this variable while the Madgraph+Pythia prediction again
performs very well.

4.3 Comparisons for the W ±+Jets/Z+Jets Ratio
In this section we brieﬂy comment on the all-order predictions from HEJ for the ratio of W ±
plus jets to Z/γ∗ plus jets events. We compare to data from a recent study undertaken by the
ATLAS collaboration [6]. The cuts for both ﬁnal states are summarised in table 3.

the corresponding values from HEJ and the ratio of the two. We see extremely good agreement
for the 2-jet ratios and the 3- and 4-jet ratios agree at the 10% level. This is comparable with
the other theoretical predictions used in the study (BlackHat+SHERPA [8, 48, 50, 51], ALPGEN [46]

5 Conclusions

In this paper we have discussed augmenting the theoretical description of inclusive Z/γ∗-plus-
dijets processes with the dominant logarithms in the High Energy limit at all orders in αs. In
particular, the description constructed here is accurate to leading logarithm in ˆs/ˆt. This is
achieved within the High Energy Jets (HEJ) framework. We began in section 2 by motivating
and describing the construction of an approximation to the hard-scattering matrix element for
an arbitrary number of gluons in the ﬁnal state. This uses factorised currents for electroweak
boson emission and outer jet production combined with a series of (gauge-invariant) eﬀective
vertices for extra QCD real emissions.
In contrast to previous HEJ constructions (for pure jets, W -plus-jets and Higgs boson-plus-
jets), the complete description of the interference contributions between Z and γ∗ processes
and between forward and backward emissions required a new regularisation procedure. This is
described in section 3 where we showed explicitly the cancellation of real and virtual divergences
by using the Lipatov ansatz to include the dominant contributions in the High Energy limit
of the all-order virtual contributions. The method by which we match our matrix element to
the leading order matrix elements was also outlined here.
In this way we achieve the formal
accuracy of our Monte Carlo predictions to Leading Logarithmic in (ˆs/ˆt) and merge Leading
Order predictions in αs for the production of two, three or four jets.
In section 4, we compared the predictions of our construction to Z/γ∗-plus-jets data collected at
the ATLAS and CMS experiments during Run I. We see excellent agreement for a wide range
of observables and can be seen to describe regions of phase space well where some other ﬁxed-
order-based predictions do not fare as well. Discrepancies which occur only do so in regions
where we do not expect this description to perform as well, for example where there is a large
ratio between pT 1 and pT 2. We also discuss properties of other available theoretical descriptions.
This all-order description of Z/γ∗-plus-dijets allows predictions for the ratio of W ±+dijets to
Z/γ∗+dijets at all-orders in αs for the ﬁrst time. This is an extremely important analysis as

24

many theoretical and experimental uncertainties cancel in this ratio and in section 4.3, we show
that we correctly reproduce the ratios of the total cross sections.
Just as for previous analyses of LHC data, it is found that the high-energy logarithms contained
in HEJ are necessary for a satisfactory description of data in key regions of phases space, e.g. at
large values of jet invariant mass. Such regions of phase space are crucial for the analysis of
Higgs boson production in association with dijets. The impact of the high-energy logarithms
will only be more pronounced at the larger centre-of-mass energy of LHC Run II, and beyond at
a possible future circular collider. The HEJ framework and Monte Carlo is the unique ﬂexible
event generator to contain these corrections and will provide important theoretical input for the
study of important processes at LHC Run II and beyond.

A Dependence on the Regularisation Parameter, λcut

In this appendix, we show results for various values of the parameter λcut deﬁned in section 3. We
increase our sensitivity to the parameter by showing results for FKL momentum conﬁgurations
only. The non-FKL samples which are added to give the total cross sections have no dependence
on λcut and would therefore dilute any dependence in the full sample. We begin in table 6 where
we show the value of the cross section for diﬀerent values of λcut for exclusive 2-, 3- and 4-jet
samples. The cuts applied are the same as in section 4.1. It is clear that the cross section does
not display a large dependence on the value of λcut.

Table 6: The FKL-only cross sections for the 2-, 3- and 4-jet exclusive rates with associated
statistical errors shown for diﬀerent values of the regularisation parameter λcut. The scale choice
was half the sum over all transverse scales in the event, HT /2.

Figure 13 shows the eﬀect of the same variation in λcut on the diﬀerential distribution in both the
rapidity gap between the two leading jets in p⊥, ∆yj1,j2, (a)–(c), and the rapidity gap between
the two extremal jets in rapidity, ∆yjf,jb, (d)–(f). Results are shown for exclusive 2-, 3- and 4-jet
samples in each case, once again the cuts applied are the same as in section 4.1. Again the scale
choice for the central line was µF = µR = HT /2. The variation bands have been determined
by varying these two scales independently by up to a factor of two in either direction with the
extremal points removed where the relative diﬀerence between µF and µR is greater than a factor
of 2. The distributions also show a very weak dependence on the choice of λcut.
In practice, our default chosen value for λcut is 0.2.
