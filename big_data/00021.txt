ABSTRACT
Massive gas-rich galaxy discs at z ∼ 1 − 3 host massive star-forming clumps with
typical baryonic masses in the range 107
− 108 M⊙ which can aﬀect the orbital de-
cay and concurrent growth of supermassive black hole (BH) pairs. We use a set of
high-resolution simulations of isolated clumpy galaxies hosting a pair of unequal-mass
BHs, in order to study the interaction between massive clumps and a BH pair at kpc
scales, during the early phase of the orbital decay, before the formation of a bound
BH binary. We ﬁnd that both the interaction with massive clumps and the heating of
the cold gas layer of the disc by BH feedback tend to delay signiﬁcantly the orbital
decay of the secondary, which in many cases is ejected and then hovers for a whole
Gyr around a separation of 1–2 kpc. In the envelope, dynamical friction is weak and
there is no contribution of disc torques: these lead to the fastest decay once the orbit
of the secondary BH has circularised in the disc midplane. In runs with larger eccen-
tricities the delay is stronger, although there are some exceptions. We also show that,
even in discs with very sporadic transient clump formation, a strong spiral pattern
appears to be enough in order to aﬀect the decay time-scale for BHs on eccentric
orbits. We conclude that, contrary to previous belief, a gas-rich background is not
necessarily conducive to a fast BH decay and binary formation, which prompts more
extensive investigations aimed at calibrating event-rate forecasts for ongoing and fu-
ture gravitational-wave searches, such as with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and the
future evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA).

INTRODUCTION

Supermassive black hole (BH) pairs at sub-kpc scales are ex-
pected to form in galactic nuclei during the hierarchical as-
sembly of structures (e.g. Begelman et al. 1980; Mayer et al.
2007; Chapon et al. 2013). In galaxy mergers, indeed, BH
pairs can undergo orbital decay via dynamical friction, form
a bound binary and eventually coalesce via the emission of
gravitational waves (GW). The time-scales associated with
the diﬀerent phases of the BH pairing up to coalescence
are still quite uncertain, with expectations for the overall

process until coalescence ranging between ∼ 108 yr to more
than a Hubble time (e.g. Mayer 2013). Such uncertainties are
problematic when one tries to infer the expected frequency of
dual as well as binary active galactic nuclei (AGN), and they
are of concern for the upcoming eﬀort of future space-born
GW experiments such as the evolved Laser Interferometer
Space Array (eLISA), which await some robust predictions
of event rates from the theory. The formation of a bound
binary is expected to occur when the BHs reach a sepa-
ration of a few pc to a few tens of pc for BH masses in
the range 106 − 109 M⊙. It is the ﬁrst necessary step to-
wards coalescence. Hydrodynamical simulations have shown
that this ﬁrst phase is particularly eﬀective when there is

enough gas in galactic nuclei, as dynamical friction leads to a
stronger drag than in purely stellar backgrounds, leading to
binary formation in only a few Myr after a major merger of
two galaxies is completed (Mayer et al. 2007; Chapon et al.
2013). The same process can take 108 − 109 yr in minor
mergers (mass ratios 1:4 – 1:10) as the light secondary BH is
stripped of its surrounding massive baryonic core due to ram
pressure and prolonged tidal eﬀects (Callegari et al. 2011;
Van Wassenhove et al. 2014; Capelo et al. 2015).

However, recent simulations considering the clumpy
multi-phase nature of the interstellar medium (ISM) in cir-
cumnuclear discs forming after the merger have shown that
BHs at the low-mass end (106 − 107 M⊙) can be ejected
from the disc plane due to gravitational encounters and/or
perturbations by a few very massive Giant Molecular Clouds
(GMCs), which results in a stiﬂing of dynamical friction and
an increase of the binary formation time to 50−100 Myr even
in major mergers (Fiacconi et al. 2013; Roškar et al. 2015).
The delay is more moderate if the secondary BH is on a cir-
cular orbit as the encounter probability with perturbers is
reduced (del Valle & Escala 2014), but eccentric orbits are
expected to result from the galaxy merger (e.g. Mayer et al.
2007; Roškar et al. 2015) and circularisation by dynamical
friction is eﬀective only at ∼ 1 kpc separations and below
(Mayer 2013). Since the eﬀect of such perturbations is im-
portant only when the BH has a mass of the order of that
of the perturbers, for more massive BHs the gravitational
perturbations of GMCs would be negligible (Fiacconi et al.
2013).

There is however a potential complication when plac-
ing the BH pairing process in the proper context of galaxy
formation end evolution. Indeed, observations of the last
decade have revealed that the majority of massive galax-
ies at high redshift, those that should host the most mas-
sive BHs, are gas-rich star-forming discs that appear clumpy
on a much larger scale than that of present-day galaxies
(Elmegreen et al. 2005, 2009). Indeed there are claims of
giant star-forming clumps with masses of up to 1010 M⊙
lurking in such galaxies (Tacconi et al. 2010; Zanella et al.
2015), and many in the range 108 − 109 M⊙ have been ob-
served (Guo et al. 2012; Tacconi et al. 2013). The origin of
such giant clumps could be partly caused by in-situ fragmen-
tation due to gravitational instability (GI) of the massive
gas disc, and partly due to ex-situ contributions by minor
mergers (Mandelker et al. 2015). Gabor & Bournaud (2013)
have also studied the accretion on to a central BH in such
a clumpy disc, arguing that it is enhanced as clumps mi-
grate to the centre and increase the amount of gas fed to
the central regions. Recently, new high-resolution hydrody-
namic simulations with stronger stellar feedback tuned to
reproduce galaxy stellar masses in cosmological simulations
have shown that the typical mass scale of in-situ clumps
formed by GI is actually in the range 107 − 108 M⊙, which
can be explained on theoretical grounds (Tamburello et al.
2015). The larger masses often inferred could actually trace
complexes of several individual 107 M⊙ clumps that are
not resolved yet by typical observations (Behrendt et al.
2015), an interpretation that seems supported by the line-of-
sight velocity measurements and by the smaller masses and
sizes always found in lensing observations of clumpy galax-
ies (Swinbank et al. 2009; Jones et al. 2010; Livermore et al.
2012, 2015).

Despite such recent revisions, it is almost indisputable
that such massive high-redshift galaxies do possess an over-
sized version of GMCs in present-day galaxies, with masses
that are conservatively in the range 107 − 108 M⊙, and can
sometimes become larger, up to 109 M⊙, due to clump-
clump mergers (Tamburello et al. 2015). Therefore, such
clumps are massive enough to possibly interfere with the
pairing of BHs having masses even exceeding 107 M⊙.

Studying such interference, if any, and its potential ef-
fect on the orbital decay of BH pairs, is the goal of this
paper. Since minor rather than major mergers are the most
typical kind of mergers expected during hierarchical galaxy
assembly, we will study BH pairs with mass ratio 1:5 (even
if in some simulations it becomes lower, 1:6, after less than
100 Myr; see also Callegari et al. 2009, 2011). Furthermore,
as such massive clumps form from fragmentation of the
large-scale galactic disc in the ﬁrst place, hence at kpc scale,
addressing their eﬀect requires modelling the earliest phase
of the BH pairing process, when the secondary BH has al-
ready settled in the disc of the primary galaxy, but is still
far from the circumnuclear-disc region. In this paper we will
thus focus on simulating the evolution of a BH pair until
its separation falls below 100 pc, therefore leaving the study
of binary formation and subsequent sub-pc scale decay to
future work. Finally, we will also address the eﬀect of the
massive clumps on the concurrent growth of the two BHs,
studying whether or not mass accretion is enhanced in a
clumpy medium.

The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes
the initial conditions and design of the simulations, Section 3
the results, taking also into account the role of the clumpy
ISM on BH mass growth and the role of a stellar spheroid
analytically added. Section 4, ﬁnally, summarises the paper
with our conclusions.

2 SIMULATIONS

We perform a set of numerical simulations of isolated galax-
ies to study the evolution of BH pairs in clumpy discs
at high redshift. Simulations are performed using the N -
body+smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) code gaso-
line2, which uses a pressure-energy formulation of the hy-
drodynamical force, thermal and metal diﬀusion, and a
Wendland kernel to remove artiﬁcial surface tension and
resolve two-ﬂuid instabilities (see e.g. Keller et al. 2015;
Governato et al. 2015; Tamburello et al. 2015).

Since we wish to study the dynamics of BH pairs in
clumpy high-redshift discs, we use two models from our pre-
vious work, in particular Models 7 and 11, listed in Table 1
of Tamburello et al. (2015). Model 11, the most massive
one with concentration 6, high gas fraction as typical for
z ∼ 2 (50 per cent of the disc mass) and a very massive disc
(8×1010 M⊙), is at the high-mass end of the observed galax-
ies at z ∼ 2, having Vmax ∼ 350 km s−1 (Wisnioski et al.
2015), and does produce several massive clumps, of mass
up to 109 M⊙, in our previous simulations without BHs
(Tamburello et al. 2015). The other one, Model 7, with con-
centration 10, gas fraction 0.3 and disc mass 4 × 1010 M⊙,
undergoes only transient fragmentation into a few clumps
and stabilises into a conﬁguration with prominent spiral pat-
terns after ∼ 200 Myr. Model 7 has a mass and maximum

circular velocity (∼ 250 km s−1) that are close to the average
expected for galaxies at z > 1, hence its behaviour should be
regarded as more representative of the typical disc galaxy at
those high redshifts. Since it undergoes only some transient
fragmentation at the beginning, the BHs will evolve in a
considerably smoother disc, hence we can consider Model 7
as the control run for any clump-related dynamical eﬀect
found with Model 11.

Hereafter we will refer to Model 11 as the clumpy model
and to Model 7 as the control model, but we should bear in
mind that Model 7 is a marginally unstable disc and not
a completely smooth disc as those considered in previous
works on minor mergers (e.g. Callegari et al. 2009, 2011).

three-
component ‘dark-matter halo+stellar disc+gaseous disc’
models using the
technique originally developed by
Hernquist (1993) and relaxed adiabatically for 1 Gyr to
avoid sudden ampliﬁcation of particle noise by the high self-
gravity of the disc. The modelling choices are thoroughly
described in Tamburello et al. (2015), to which the reader
should refer. After 1 Gyr the BHs are inserted as massive
collisionless particles and at the same time radiative cooling
is switched on. In all runs we adopt metal-dependent cool-
ing using the implementation of CLOUDY (Ferland et al.
1998) tables in the hydrodynamical code as described by
Shen et al. (2010).

For the sub-grid prescriptions, we adopt the recipes de-
scribed in Stinson et al. (2006) for star formation and (blast-
wave) supernova feedback: in particular, a star can form if
the progenitor gas particle has a temperature lower than
3× 104 K and is denser than 10 cm−3, with a star formation
eﬃciency ǫSF = 0.01, while supernovae release an energy of
4 × 1050 erg. In some of the runs (see Table 2) we also add
accretion on to the BHs and thermal BH feedback as de-
scribed in Bellovary et al. (2010) and Bonoli et al. (2015).
Basically BHs are assumed to accrete gas isotropically, ac-
cording to a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (hereafter, Bondi; Bondi
1952) accretion recipe:

˙Macc =

4παG2M 2
BHρg
s + v2)3/2 ,
(c2

(1)

where ρg is the local gas density, cs is the sound speed, v is
the relative velocity of the BH compared to the gas velocity,
G is the gravitational constant, MBH is the BH mass, and
α = 1 is the BH accretion boost factor. Accretion rate is
limited by the Eddington rate, which follows the equation:

where mp is the proton mass, ǫr is the radiative eﬃciency of
the accreted gas (here 0.1), σT is the Thomson cross section,
and c is the speed of light in vacuum.

BH feedback, ﬁnally, follows a thermal model in which
a fraction (ǫf = 0.001) of the mass-energy of the accreted
gas is converted to radiative energy and then is isotropically
distributed to the kernel of the SPH particle (without using
a blastwave model to delay the cooling as in Bellovary et al.
2010). As we already said, at the end of the adiabatic re-
laxation (i.e. after 1 Gyr), we add two BHs in both mod-
els. The most massive (the primary) BH is at the centre
of mass of the galaxy, while the least massive (secondary)
is at an initial separation a0 from the centre equal to the
disc scale length radius (1.55 kpc for the control model and
2.27 kpc for the clumpy model), and has a velocity v0 equal
to that of the local baryonic centre of mass. The assumption
on the initial separation is consistent with the typical dis-
tance from the centre that the secondary BH has following
an unequal-mass galaxy merger with typical orbital param-
eters (Callegari et al. 2011; Capelo et al. 2015), once most
of the baryonic core of the galaxy around the BH has been
stripped, and hence the BH can be treated as “naked” as we
assumed here.

The mass of the primary BH is computed using the

equation in Bennert et al. (2010):

log MBH − 8 = α′(log M∗ − 10) + β log(1 + z) + γ + σ, (3)
where α′ is the slope of the relation at z = 0, β describes the
evolution of the scaling relation (β = 0 means no evolution),
γ is the intercept of the relation at z = 0, and σ is the
intrinsic scatter. For these parameters, we use the values
given in Table 3 of Bennert et al. (2010), obtained ﬁtting
objects from Bennert et al. (2010) and Merloni et al. (2010):
α′ = 1.12, β = 1.15, γ = −0.68, and σ = 0.16. The initial
mass of the secondary BH is 1/5 of that of the primary one.
The BHs mass is reported in Table 1.

In our simulations, summarised in Table 2, we change
the eccentricity of the orbit of the secondary BH, see Ta-
ble 2. As in Fiacconi et al. (2013), the ratio f between the
radial and azimuthal components of the initial velocity v0
speciﬁes the orbit of the secondary BH. The initial velocity
is |v0| = Vc(a0), where Vc(a0) is the circular velocity at the
initial separation. The initial eccentricity e0 of the orbit is
also determined by the ratio f (assuming a bound Keplerian
orbit, i.e. elliptical):

pericentre distances. The number of gas particles is 105, as is
the number of star particles, whereas the dark matter parti-
cles are 1.2×106. The gravitational softening is 100 pc for all
the components. As described in Tamburello et al. (2015),
owing to the relatively high number of particles, the hydro-
dynamical resolution is much higher, as smoothing lengths
are a factor of 10 lower than the gravitational softening in
the high-density regions of the disc. We ran 22 simulations
(11 per model; see Table 2), varying the initial eccentricity
of the orbit of the secondary BH and the BH accretion and
feedback parameters (α and ǫf ), up to the point the BHs
form a close pair (i.e. their separation falls below the grav-
itational softening, 100 pc). If a close pair does not form
after 1 Gyr, we stop the simulation, since our simulations
are isolated.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Orbital Decay

As already found in previous work (Callegari et al. 2011;
Fiacconi et al. 2013; Roškar et al. 2015), the BH orbital de-
cay is aﬀected by the presence of dense structures and
clumps. The most common trend in our simulations is a
delay.

3.1.1 Control model

The control model resembles a galaxy at z ∼ 1, as al-
ready shown in Tamburello et al. (2015), and produces fewer
clumps compared to the clumpy model, for this reason of-
fering a simple benchmark for comparison purposes. This
model has a disc mass of 4.5 × 1010 M⊙ and gas fraction
0.3. The mass of the primary BH is 2.4 × 108 M⊙, whereas
the secondary BH has a mass of 4.8 × 107 M⊙, comparable
to the mass of our clumps. In the case without BH accre-
tion and feedback, with eccentricity e0 = 0, the BH orbital
decay is quite smooth (see Figure 1, top panel) with peaks
due to clumps’ presence at 20–50 Myr after the beginning of
the simulation. Notice that clumps form earlier with respect
to the simulations in our previous work (Tamburello et al.
2015), probably because of the perturbing inﬂuence of the
secondary BH, in analogy to the triggered fragmentation
phenomenon well documented for self-gravitating protoplan-
etary discs (Meru 2015).

The clumps are still short-lived as in our original runs,
hence they disturb only marginally the orbital decay, with
the BH close-pairing time (i.e. BH separation < 100 pc)
happening in less than 200 Myr. As we turn on BH accre-
tion, we expect a faster orbital decay, since the secondary
BH can increase its mass and so both dynamical friction
and disc torques should be more eﬃcient. This, however,
does not happen because the secondary BH does not grow
signiﬁcantly, as discussed further below, and because of the
complex interplay with BH feedback, which rareﬁes the gas,
making the orbital decay time-scale longer: the density of

scale larger, because BH feedback rareﬁes the gas and dynamical
friction becomes less eﬃcient. In the third panel, ǫf is reduced by
a factor 10 (from 0.001 to 0.0001) compared to the second panel:
reducing the BH feedback eﬃciency leads back to a shorter orbital
decay, because the BH is not able to rarefy the gas. Finally, in
the fourth panel, we increase the BH accretion boost factor, α,
from 1 to 10 [see Equation (1)] and the orbital decay time-scale
becomes slightly longer than in the standard case (second panel),
due to the slightly higher feedback.

the gas around the secondary BH is lower in the case with
accretion than in the case with no accretion, by a factor
of ∼10 on average, especially in the early times. Because
the dynamical friction time-scale scales with the dynamical
time, which is proportional to the inverse of the square root
of the density, a factor of ∼10 in density implies a factor of
∼3 in BH pairing time-scale, which is close to what seen in
Figure 1 (compare the top two panels: the BH close-pairing
time increases from 169 to 378 Myr). If we try to decouple
the eﬀect of BH accretion from that of BH feedback, to un-
derstand their role, we notice that when we decrease the BH
feedback eﬃciency (from ǫf = 0.001 to 0.0001; third panel
of Figure 1), the BH close-pairing time becomes again short
(276 Myr), as expected. We double-checked this assumption
by reducing the BH feedback eﬃciency even further (see Ta-
ble 2; ǫf = 0.00001, not shown in Figure 1), obtaining a BH
close-pairing time of 158 Myr, comparable to the case with-
out accretion, showing that the eﬀect of only BH accretion is
negligible and that BH feedback is responsible for the change
in the BH orbital time-scale. We also tested a case where we
increased the value of the BH accretion boost factor α [from
1 to 10; see Equation (1)]. Even if one could in principle
expect an increase in ˙Macc by a factor of 10, this does not
happen because of self-regulation, and the increase is very
small. As a consequence, the increase in BH close-pairing
time is also negligible (423 versus 378 Myr; see the second
and fourth panels in Figure 1).

Of course, also eccentricity plays an important role in

the orbital decay. In particular, in the absence of BH accre-
tion, the higher the eccentricity, the higher the time needed
to form a close pair (see Figure 2, left panels), consistent
with what found in Fiacconi et al. (2013). In the presence
of BH accretion, the behaviour is similar, even if more com-
plex, because feedback makes the gas warmer and spiral
waves become weaker; we still observe an increase of the or-
bital decay time-scale increasing the eccentricity. One could
think that, due to high eccentricity, the secondary BH should
form a close pair earlier since it approaches more the denser
region around the primary BH, but this does not happen.
As discussed in Mayer (2013) and in Fiacconi et al. (2013),
the fastest phase of the decay is not due to dynamical fric-
tion, but to the spiral wave torques (like in planet migra-
tion), because it is only then that the angular momentum
decreases fast. Basically, at the beginning, the orbit needs
to circularise, because when the orbit is eccentric the spiral
wave torque is weak, since it is changing sign along the or-
bit. Once circularisation is complete, the spiral wave torque
acts quickly and leads to a fast decay. This is clear in Fig-
ure 2, both left and right panels: orbits circularise ﬁrst (see
the pericentres and apocentres getting more similar), then
the decay happens fast. Moreover, comparing the ﬁrst panel
with the last one on the left of Figure 2, one can notice
that, once the circularisation happens, the close pair forma-
tion happens in the same time, i. e. ∼ 200 Myr or less.

3.1.2 Clumpy model

The clumpy model, with a higher gas fraction (0.5) and disc
mass (8 × 1010 M⊙) than those in the control model, re-
sembles a galaxy at z ∼ 2 even if, as discussed in our pre-
vious work (Tamburello et al. 2015), it is an extreme case
for high-redshift galaxies (see Wisnioski et al. 2015). The
mass of the primary BH is 4.9 × 108 M⊙, whereas the sec-
ondary BH has a mass of 9.8 × 107 M⊙. This case gives
rise to a markedly diﬀerent nature of the gaseous back-
ground in which the secondary BH evolves, since the massive
self-gravitating disc fragments into many more, more mas-
sive, and longer-lived clumps than in the control model (see
Tamburello et al. 2015). The results are not as straightfor-
ward as in the control model, as the multiple massive clumps
and strongly perturbed disc background with a vigorous spi-
ral pattern (in part forced by the clumps) lead to a stochastic
behaviour of the orbital dynamics of the secondary BH.

As in Roškar et al. (2015), the orbital decay is strongly
aﬀected by the complex gravitational interactions between
the secondary BH and individual clumps. Depending on how
the interaction takes place, a clump encounter can indeed ac-
celerate or delay the decay, as it can exert both positive and
negative torques. Furthermore, overdense spiral arms also
exert strong non-linear torques, which can also be either
positive o negative, a situation reminiscent of the migration
of gas giant planets in self-gravitating protoplanetary discs
(Baruteau et al. 2011; Malik et al. 2015). BH accretion and
feedback complicate further the scenario by aﬀecting the
density and temperature of the background. By looking at
the overall ensemble of clumpy-disc simulations, it is evident
that the most common outcome is a substantial delay of the
orbital decay (see Figures 3 and 4). In particular, this delay
always occurs with BH accretion and feedback (Figure 3),
which conﬁrms the trend seen also in the control run when

Figure 2. Time evolution of the BH separation for the control model with diﬀerent eccentricities: on the left we show the cases without
BH accretion, whereas on the right we include BH accretion and feedback. In both cases increasing the eccentricity (from top to bottom,
the eccentricity is 0, 0.2, 0.8, and 0.9) delays the orbital decay time-scale compared to the case with e0 = 0. This happens, as explained
in the text, because the orbit needs to circularise before, then the spiral-wave torque acts quickly and leads to a fast decay. Notice that
the orbital decay in the right panels is longer than that in the corresponding left panels due to the presence of BH feedback. In the third
case of the right panels we do not form a close BH pair in less than 1 Gyr (our time limit for all the simulations), but the BH separation
is less than 300 pc.

Figure 3. Time evolution of the BH separation for the clumpy
model in the cases with zero eccentricity. From top to bottom: in
the ﬁrst panel we show the case without BH accretion. Switching
on BH accretion and feedback (from the second to the fourth
panel) makes the orbital decay time-scale larger and the BH close
pairing never happens (within 1 Gyr). In the third panel, ǫf is
reduced by a factor 10 (from 0.001 to 0.0001) compared to the
second panel, but the presence of many clumps does not allow
the BH pair formation. Finally, in the last panel we increase the
BH accretion boost factor, α, from 1 to 10 [see Equation (1)] and
the close BH pair never happens.

BH accretion and feedback are considered. Indeed, there are
runs where the orbit of the secondary BH does not decay
in even 1 Gyr (and, being isolated simulations, we decided
to interrupt such runs as they would not be meaningful on
longer time-scales; see e.g. Tamburello et al. 2015 for a dis-
cussion).

layed orbital decay in clumpy discs is that the clump-BH
interaction results in perturbations of the orbit of the sec-
ondary BH. These perturbations can either increase the ra-
dius of the orbit of the secondary BH within the disc, or lead
to vertical oscilations up to ∼ 2 kpc above the disc midplane:
at this distance the density is so low that dynamical friction
and disc torques become very ineﬃcient (see Figure 5). This
is a major diﬀerence relative to control runs, where there
are no massive clumps that can cause ejections.

Without BH accretion and feedback the outcome is de-
pendent on the orbital eccentricity. This is consistent with
result on nuclear discs, which also found the eccentricity of
the orbit to be very important (e.g. Fiacconi et al. 2013;
del Valle & Escala 2014). Looking at Figure 3 in more de-
tail, we can see that, for the case of the circular orbit (top
panel), the BH close-pairing time is fast, i.e. 146 Myr. Re-
markably, the decay is faster in this case relative to the con-
trol run, at odds with the general trend towards a delayed
orbital decay. We explain this by analogy with the results of
migrating gas giant planets in massive self-gravitating discs,
where it is found that the non-linear disc torques, mainly
originating from the co-orbital region, increase steeply with
increasing gas density (Malik et al. 2015). While we post-
pone a detailed torque analysis to a forthcoming paper, the
analogy should hold because, as we have already explained,
on circular orbits disc torques rather than dynamical friction
drive the orbital decay. Finally, we note that in this case the
decay is so fast that the probability of scattering on to mas-
sive clumps, that are still rare at this early stage, is very low,
allowing to describe the decay as if clumps were not present
(the secondary BH encounters lower-mass clumps that are
seen to be disrupted by its tidal force on its way to the cen-
tre). In addition, on circular orbits the velocity diﬀerence
between clumps and BHs will be statistically smaller, hence
the torques exerted by clumps will be smaller.

Figure 4. Time evolution of the BH separation for the clumpy model with diﬀerent eccentricities: without BH accretion and feedback
on the left, and with BH accretion and feedback on the right. Eccentricity increases from top to bottom (0, 0.2, 0.8, and 0.9). In the
clumpy cases the situation is more complicated than in the control cases. In the cases without BH accretion and low eccentricity, 0 and
0.2 (ﬁrst and second panels on the left side) the orbital decay happens faster than in the control model (see Figure 2, top left panels, for
a comparison), while in the other cases the pairing never happens, because a high eccentricity favours clump encounters that can scatter
the secondary BH. Adding BH accretion and feedback (right side), rareﬁes and heats the gas, making less eﬃcient the dynamical friction
and therefore causing a delay, but encounters with clumps also change continuously the secondary BH dynamics.

sity of the gas weakens disc torques, slowing down the decay.
As a result, the secondary BH orbits for a longer time in the
fragmenting disc, becoming more susceptible to perturba-
tions by massive clumps. This explains why the character
of the decay changes dramatically, leading to a clear delay.
The peak at ∼ 500 Myr in the second panel of Figure 3, for
example, is due to an interaction with an individual clump.
In the third panel of Figure 3 we reduce the BH feedback
eﬃciency ǫf from 0.001 to 0.0001. We would expect that, as
in the control case, having a lower ǫf would yield a shorter
orbital decay time-scale, but this does not occur because the
perturbations by massive clumps dominate the orbital dy-
namics in this case, scattering the secondary BH into the
low-density envelope around the disc plane.

The eﬀect of varying eccentricity does not reveal an
overall systematic trend in clumpy runs when BH accretion
and feedback are included. This is because the orbital dy-
namics loses memory of the initial conditions very quickly
due to the repeated perturbations by massive clumps and
strong spiral waves. Indeed, as it is evident from Figure 4,
the eccentricity evolves stochastically in each single run in-
dependently of the initial value. The tendency is towards
maintaining an excitation of the eccentricity until the end
of the simulation.

3.2 Eﬀect of a clumpy ISM on BH mass growth

By comparing our clumpy runs with their corresponding
control runs, which produce very few, short-lived clumps,
we can single out the eﬀect of a clumpy ISM on BH mass
growth. Consider the most simple case, with standard BH
accretion and feedback, and zero eccentricity. In the control
run, when the close BH pair forms, the primary BH grows up
to 3.3×108 M⊙, while the secondary up to 5.6×107 M⊙, less
than a factor 1.5 from the beginning of the simulation. In the
corresponding clumpy run, on the other hand, the mass of

MNRAS 000, 1–?? (0000)

the primary BH at the end of the simulation is 1.2× 109 M⊙
(the mass of the secondary is still low, ∼ 108 M⊙), more
than a factor 2 larger than the initial mass, already reached
at ∼ 378 Myr, the time at which a close pair forms in the
control run.

By inspection of Figure 6 (which is a representative
comparison of all our simulations), we can see that the mass
accretion in the control run is almost a factor of 10 lower
than that in the clumpy run. There are at least two reasons
behind the diﬀerent mass accretion rates. First of all, the
primary BH in the clumpy model is initialised to be about a
factor of 2 more massive than that in the control run. This
implies that, just based on the Bondi accretion dependence
on mass, we expect ˙Macc to be 4 times higher in the clumpy
run. The average gas density in the more massive disc with
higher gas fraction in the clumpy run is also a factor of ∼ 2
higher than in the control run, which yields an increase of
another factor of ∼ 2 in the Bondi rate. Therefore, simply
the higher BH mass and gas density alone account for nearly
all the diﬀerence seen in the BH accretion rate between the
two runs. Considering also that the clumpy disc is more
strongly self-gravitating and therefore must support a more
vigorous gas inﬂow rate through spiral-wave driven torques,
there appears to be very little remaining room for a direct
role of clumps in the higher accretion rate. A caveat is, of
course, that the concurrent role of BH feedback will alter
the simple behaviour of the mass accretion rate underscored
by the dependencies in the Bondi rate.

The presence of clumps is however discernible from the
more episodic character of mass accretion relative to the
control run, with peaks seemingly associated with the ac-
cretion of the two most massive clumps (Mcl−gas ∼ 4 × 108
and 1.4 × 108 M⊙), which migrate to the galaxy centre and
are accreted by the primary BH.
As one can see, our BHs never accrete at Eddington
rate. In a previous work, Gabor & Bournaud (2013) found

Figure 5. Surface density maps, face-on and edge-on, for the control model (top panels) at 42 Myr and the clumpy model (bottom
panels) at 345 Myr, with BH accretion, feedback, zero eccentricity and α = 10. Times are chosen to show the maximum separation of
the secondary BH from the midplane in the ﬁrst 400 Myr. In the control model, the secondary BH is always close to the midplane (the
maximum distance in z-axis is much lower than ∼ 500 pc), because the clumps are small, disappear in the ﬁrst ∼ 100 Myr and do not
aﬀect BH dynamics. In the clumpy model, the secondary BH can exceed 1 kpc from the midplane and reach hotter and less dense regions
due to clump interactions.

that the mass accretion rates for the central BH are gener-
ally lower than in our case: indeed in their simulations the
BH accretion rate is generally 10−5 M⊙ yr−1, whereas we
ﬁnd ∼ 10−1 M⊙ yr−1 in the control case and ∼ 1 M⊙ yr−1 in
the clumpy case. The substantial diﬀerence is that they have
peaks that reach the Eddington rate, whereas we do not. We
can compare our control and clumpy runs with standard BH
accretion and feedback to their models M16f10 and M4f50,
respectively. This behaviour has likely two reasons: ﬁrst of
all, in Gabor & Bournaud (2013), the aim was studying the
BH growth in a clumpy medium, so they have only one cen-
tral BH, into which all the produced clumps can accrete,
while we have also the second BH that perturbs the medium
and can accrete clumps as well. The massive perturber is
very important in the control case, where gravity is not dom-
inant like in the clumpy case, and indeed our galaxy has spi-
ral arms also in the central part and a higher inﬂow, whereas
the model M16f10 of Gabor & Bournaud (2013) does not:
the gas density map is quite smooth (see their Figure 1,
bottom-left panel), except for some clumps in the outer

part, maybe due a diﬀerent relaxation phase of the disc or
to the short simulation time. Moreover, Gabor & Bournaud
(2013) have BHs ten time less massive than in our mod-
els (and therefore a lower Eddington mass accretion rate),
which could explain the observed peaks at Eddington rates
in their mass accretion rates.

3.3 Limits of the isolated simulations; the

“asymptotic” decay time-scale

In our initial conditions, the disc scale height is 0.05 Rd,
where Rd ∼ 2 kpc. During the simulations, the vertical disc
extent remains below 1 kpc, even during the vigorous frag-
mentation phase of the clumpy disc model (see Figure 5,
edge-on views). This implies that, when the secondary BH
is ejected out of the disc plane, the drag by dynamical fric-
tion drops dramatically, and the orbital decay is correspond-
ingly suppressed. As a result, a close BH pair never forms
in most of the clumpy-disc runs. However, by construction
our galaxy models lack an extended dense spheroidal com-

Figure 6. Time evolution of the mass accretion rate (solid lines) for the primary (blue) and secondary (red) BH in the control model
(left panel) and clumpy model (right panel) with standard BH accretion and feedback (α = 1, ǫf = 0.001, ǫr = 0.1) and zero eccentricity.
BH Eddington accretion rates are also shown (dashed lines). The BH accretion rate in the clumpy model is a factor 10 higher than in
the control case and shows peaks due to accretion of clumps, see the text for more details. The ﬁnal BH masses are 3.3 × 108 M⊙ and

ponent, such as a stellar bulge, whose presence would in-
crease the background stellar density above and below the
disc plane. It is thus important to consider the eﬀect of such
a component on the orbital decay of the BHs that are ejected
out of the disc. In passing, we note that a small exponen-
tial pseudo-bulge forms as a result of gas inﬂows during
the relaxation phase of our initial conditions (with mass
∼ 4 × 109 M⊙) and later grows even more by further in-
ﬂows and inward clump migration during the fragmentation
phase, as discussed in Tamburello et al. (2015). However,
such a bulge is ﬂat and disky, extending less than 200 pc
from the midplane, and thus yields no extra contribution to
the stellar density beyond the disc midplane.

For this reason,

in this last section, we investigate
the eﬀect of adding an extended spherical stellar bulge
to the calculation of the orbital decay time-scale in the
cases when, during the simulations, the secondary BH some-
times moves out of the disc into a background of stars, los-
ing orbital angular momentum due to dynamical friction.
The Chandrasekhar (1943) dynamical friction (DF) formula
gives us an equation for the force to which the BH is subject:

FDF = −16π2G2M 2

where v is the velocity of the BH relative to the background,
ma is the individual mass of the particles in the background,
va their velocity, f (va)dv is the number of particles with
velocity between v and v + dv, and ln Λ is the Coulomb
logarithm.

Now, consider a BH subject to dynamical friction ex-
erted by a stellar bulge described by a Hernquist (1990)

If we also consider a Maxwellian distribution function for
the velocity and assume v to be large enough so that we
can estimate the integral term in Equation (5) up to inﬁnity
(within a factor ξ), the integral converges to the number

Because the force is perpendicular to the radial direc-
tion and produces a torque, we can substitute Equation (8)
into Equation (7) to obtain an expression for the torque:

We can then equate the two equations above, dL/dt =

ﬁnd an estimate for the dynamical friction time-scale deﬁned
as the time required for the orbital angular momentum to
go to zero:

Table 3. The table shows the estimated dynamical friction time-
scale [in units of (rinit/1 kpc)5/2 Myr], using Equation (11) and
assuming ln Λ = 5, for the clumpy model, where the secondary
BH mass is 9.8 × 107 M⊙, for a in the range 300 − 400 pc and
Mb in the range 109 − 5 × 109 M⊙.

With this equation, where MBH is the secondary BH’s
initial mass (we used the initial mass, because we have seen
that the secondary BH does not grow much during the sim-
ulations) and rinit is the distance from the centre the BH
ﬁnds itself at, we try to estimate the orbital decay time-
scale for the clumpy model, using a range of values for a
and Mb (see Table 3). Notice that, in order to obtain Equa-
tion (11), we used the approximation rinit ≫ a, which ﬁts
our typical values, but in the opposite case, rinit ≪ a, the
equation is still valid simply multiplying the left-hand side
by a factor of 3. In both approximations, the orbital decay
time-scale decreases when increasing the bulge scale radius
a or decreasing the bulge total mass Mb. When rinit ≪ a,
the dynamical friction force is independent of a, but the
angular momentum of the BH decreases with a and so the
time-scale. In the case rinit ≫ a, instead, the angular mo-
mentum is independent of a, whereas the dynamical friction
force increases with a, so the time-scale decreases. Analo-
gously, the dynamical friction force is independent of Mb
and the angular momentum increases with the bulge mass,
so the time-scale increases. Table 3 shows that the dynam-
ical friction time-scales due to the bulge are shorter than
0.1 Gyr in general, assuming, as we have done, that the sec-
ondary BH starts at a radius of 1 kpc from the centre, this
being a typical distance after ejection (see Figure 5). Such a
time-scale should be conservatively interpreted as a return
time-scale rather than an actual orbital decay time-scale, as
after this time the secondary BH reaches again the disc mid-
plane and could again be scattered by a massive clump as
long as the disc is still undergoing fragmentation (although
this will be unlikely as the secondary BH will indeed be very
close to the centre, where clumps are easily teared apart by
tidal forces).

4 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The role of gravitational interactions with clumps as well as
that of BH accretion and feedback are both very important
for the orbital decay. Looking at the results of the various
runs in Table 2 and recalling that the control model frag-
ments only moderately and becomes stable after 150 Myr,
while the clumpy model fragments vigorously for longer than
500 Myr, we can distinguish 4 cases:

(i) control model - without BH accretion and feedback:

a close BH pair, which eventually will bind into a binary,
always forms;

(ii) control model - with BH accretion and feedback: a
close BH pair always forms, but with a delay of about a
factor of 2;

(iii) clumpy model - without BH accretion and feedback:
a close BH pair can form only in some conditions, namely
when the eccentricity is low, so that the orbital decay time-
scale is intrinsically fast owing to eﬃcient disc torques.

(iv) clumpy model - with BH accretion and feedback: a
close BH pairs almost never forms because the orbit of the
secondary BH becomes eccentric, irrespective of the initial
eccentricity, leading to clump-BH interactions which perturb
the orbit of the secondary BH, causing a long delay.

In the fourth case, it is really the combination of (a)
weaker drag in the more rareﬁed gaseous background heated
by BH feedback, and (b) gravitational scattering of the sec-
ondary BH by massive clumps that explains why the orbital
decay time-scale becomes so long as to lead, in some cases,
to a complete stalling of the binary (see Figure 3). Usually,
after less than 400 Myr, the secondary BH is perturbed (and
sometimes ejected) by fast-moving massive clumps in low-
density regions, see Figure 5. The secondary can then keep
wandering at kpc distances for 1 Gyr, or until the end of the
simulation.

Furthermore, clumps always excite the eccentricity of
the BH pair, which is often not damped until the end of
the simulation. This is interesting since it suggests that the
orbit of the secondary BH, if it returns to the midplane and
restarts to decay, will have a high eccentricity no matter
what the orbit was soon after the galaxy merger. Thus, in
this case, gas does not lead to circularisation, but rather the
opposite. If the role of stellar encounters becomes important
at smaller binary separations, these will keep the eccentricity
high, possibly delivering a tight eccentric binary to the ﬁnal
GW emission stage, which then will occur on a very fast
track.

Once the secondary BH is ejected due to gravitational
encounters with clumps, it ﬁnds itself in a much lower den-
sity region, where dynamical friction becomes very weak and
disc torques are absent. Dynamical friction is further weak-
ened when BH feedback heats up the gas and produces a
low-density warm envelope around the disc.

The actual values of the orbital decay time-scales in
the clumpy runs should be taken with caution since our
simulations model isolated galaxies while at high redshift
interactions, mergers and rapid, prominent gas accretion
will always take place. Moreover, the calculations of the
last section show that the eﬀect of a (dense) bulge could
be crucial in re-starting the decay and bringing the sec-
ondary BH back into the disc midplane in less than 1 Gyr.
While many of the clumpy high-redshift star-forming galax-
ies do not exhibit clear evidence that they do possess al-
ready a bulge, migration of massive clumps to the centre
has been advocated often as a mechanism to grow such a
bulge (e.g. Bournaud 2016). Compact “red nuggets” are ob-
served at similar redshifts as clumpy, star forming galaxies.
These red nuggets could be bulges that have already begun
to quench (Barro et al. 2013). An evolutionary connection
between red nuggets and clumpy star-forming galaxies has
been attempted, and probably requires a combined role of

MNRAS 000, 1–?? (0000)

mergers and disc fragmentation (Dekel & Burkert 2014). If
such connection exists and red nuggets are related to bulges,
then red nuggets could be the result of rapid quenching of
star-forming clumpy galaxies, which would suggest a short
duration of the clumpy phase, possibly of order a Gyr. Like-
wise, in the last section we have shown that once the bulge is
present, the secondary BH returns to the plane in less than
0.1 Gyr. Therefore, once the host galaxy enters a red-nugget
phase, it is conceivable that the orbital decay will promptly
restart and lead to the formation of a BH binary in less than
1 Gyr. The stalling phase would thus last at most up to the
time of bulge formation, which appears to happen not more
than 1 Gyr after the epoch of clumpy high-redshift galaxies.
The results of this work, when combined with the re-
sults obtained on the scale of BH pairs at smaller separations
in circumnuclear discs (e.g. Fiacconi et al. 2013), as well as
with those of multi-scale gas-rich mergers probing sub-pc
scale separations in both smooth and clumpy ISM condi-
tions (Chapon et al. 2013; Roškar et al. 2015) suggest that
the orbital decay of BH pairs in gaseous backgrounds occurs
in a variety of regimes, some of which lead to a slow orbital
decay that is not more eﬃcient than that found in modern
calculations of the orbital decay and hardening of BH bina-
ries embedded in stellar distributions where partial loss cone
reﬁlling occurs owing to centrophilic stellar orbits in triaxial
potentials (Khan et al. 2011, 2012; Sesana & Khan 2015).
This is contrary to the conventional notion that gaseous
backgrounds speed-up the orbital decay process signiﬁcantly
already from the BH binary formation stage and avoid the
last parsec problem altogether (Mayer 2013). The stellar dy-
namical simulations ﬁnd BH merger time-scales of order a
few Gyr for stellar hosts akin to present-day galaxies, where
the time-scale is estimated by extrapolating to the separa-
tion at which the GW emission phase starts and leads to
prompt coalescence (Sesana & Khan 2015). Estimating an
overall coalescence time-scale for the BHs in our simulations
is not trivial since, as we elaborated, the host may enter a
quenched, red-nugget phase in which the binary may ﬁnally
form and then harden due to the interaction with a stel-
lar background, exactly because in a quenched system the
contribution of stars to the mass will become dominant rel-
ative to that of the ISM. However, existing calculations of
binary hardening in stellar background assume stellar poten-
tial akin to those of present-day galaxies, hence not directly
applicable to our situation. This will have to be explored
with future multi-scale calculations of binary BHs embed-
ded in realistic models of high-redshift galaxies. For now,
we can only assert that the ﬁrst stage of the orbital de-
cay, namely the formation of the binary BH, will occur on a
time-scale of a few times 108 yr to 1 Gyr in clumpy galaxies,
The overall BH orbital decay time up to ﬁnal coalescence
can only be longer than this. These are long time-scales at
an epoch, such as z ∼ 2, when the lookback time is only
∼ 3 Gyr.
We argue that, between z ∼ 3 and ∼ 1, namely up to the
epoch at which the fraction of clumpy galaxies appears to
drop (Förster Schreiber et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2015), there
is a phase in which the eﬀects described in this paper on
the cosmic population of massive BH pairs are important. In
such a case the probability of having wandering BHs is max-
imal, as they are waiting to restart decay after the spheroid
has been established. If such a phase exists, since separa-

Orbital decay of BHs in clumpy galaxies

tions between BHs can become of a few kpc, the probability
of detecting bright dual AGN (the BHs in massive clumpy
galaxies will be at least as massive as we assumed here, hence
powerful radiation sources) will be high. At the same time,
such phase is the least favourable epoch for detecting BH
mergers with GW experiments. While eLISA is primarily
sensitive to lighter BHs, which would be hosted in galaxies
more similar to our control run, thus in principle not sub-
ject to delayed orbital decay in clumpy discs, it has been re-
cently pointed out that Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) would
be sensitive to BH mergers over a range of redshifts, and in
particular at z ∼ 2, due to the time-dependent behaviour
of the luminosity distance in the concordance cosmology
(Klein et al. 2016). Since PTAs are primarily sensitive to
mergers between BHs in the mass range of those consid-
ered in this work, the possible “dearth” of such mergers at
z ∼ 1.5 − 2.5 suggested here could be an important eﬀect to
take into account.
Finally, we stress the fact that BH feedback alone leads
to a delay in the BH binary formation even in relatively
smooth galaxy hosts as those of the control runs. While the
measured delay is moderate, about a factor of 2, it remains
to be assessed how the quantitative result will change for
galaxy hosts and BHs more in line with the typical tar-
gets that eLISA will probe, namely BHs with mass below
107 M⊙, which would then likely reside in galaxies about
a factor of 5 − 10 less massive than the models adopted in
the control run. Since not only the BH masses and galaxy
masses would be diﬀerent, but also the eﬀect of feedback will
change (if anything because the accretion rate on lighter BH
will be diﬀerent and the ambient density and pressure will
be also diﬀerent), new simulations targeted to the problem
will be needed.
