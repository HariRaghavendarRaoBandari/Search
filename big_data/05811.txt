FINITE AND ´ETALE POLYLOGARITHMS

KENJI SAKUGAWA AND SHIN-ICHIRO SEKI

Abstract. We introduce ´etale polylogarithms according to Wojtkowiak. Then, we
show an explicit formula relating ´etale polylogarithms and ﬁnite polylogarithms which
were introduced by Elbaz-Vincent and Gangl. This formula is an ´etale analog of Besser’s
formula relating Coleman’s p-adic polylogarithms and the ﬁnite polylogarithms.

The polylogarithm appears in many ﬁelds of mathematics in diﬀerent forms. The

classical one is deﬁned by the inﬁnite sum

1. Introduction

(1)

Lim(z) :=

zn

z ∈ C

∞Xn=1

for each positive integer m. The inﬁnite sum (1) converges absolutely if the absolute
value of z is less than 1. This holomorphic function has an analytic continuation to C
as a multi-valued holomorphic function. We can deﬁne a single-valued version Lm(z)
of Lim(z), which is a natural generalization of the Bloch–Wigner function ([22, p.413
(33)]). Before stating our main result (= Theorem 1.1), we recall various analogs of
Lim(z), Lm(z), and recall relations between them.

1.1. Coleman’s p-adic polylogarithms. Let p be a prime number and Cp the p-adic
completion of an algebraic closure of Qp. We denote by | |p the valuation on Cp normalized
as |p|p = p−1. Then, for z ∈ Cp with |z|p < 1, the inﬁnite sum (1) converges in Cp and
we denote this inﬁnite sum by Lip-adic
(z) ∈ Cp. In [2], R. Coleman deﬁned an analytic
continuation of Lip-adic
to Cp \ {1} as so-called a Coleman function. We can deﬁne two
Coleman functions L p-adic
. For the
deﬁnitions of them, see [12, Introduction] and [1, Theorem 1.1], respectively. It is known
that L p-adic

as p-adic analogs of Lm by using Lip-adic

satisfy functional equations similar to Lm (cf. [18]).

1.2. Wojtkowiak’s p-adic ´etale polylogarithms. Z. Wojtkowiak introduced a p-adic
´etale analog of Lm which is called a p-adic ´etale polylogarithm (cf. [20, Deﬁnition 11.0.1]).
Let K be a number ﬁeld, z ∈ K, and γ a Qp-path in P1
K \ {0, 1, ∞} from the tangential
−→
01 to z. Then, the value of p-adic ´etale polylogarithm lim(z, γ) at z attached
base point
to γ is deﬁned as a continuous function

(2)

lim(z, γ) : GK := Gal(K/K) → Qp(m),

where K is an algebraic closure of K and Qp(m) is the m-th Tate twist of the trivial Galois
representation Qp. There is also a “multiple version” of the p-adic ´etale poloylogarithms
called p-adic ´etale iterated integrals. See [19] or Deﬁnition 2.13 for the precise deﬁnition.
H. Nakamura, Wojtkowiak, and the ﬁrst author showed an explicit formula relating
Coleman’s p-adic polylogarithms and Wojtkowiak’s p-adic ´etale polylogarithms in [11],

[12]. Let Z[K \ {0, 1}] be the free abelian group generated by the set K \ {0, 1} and take
i=1 ai{zi} ∈ Z[K \ {0, 1}]. Then, under some “Bloch condition” for m,

an element ξ =Pn

the linear sum

ailim(zi, γi) : GK → Qp(m)

nXi=1

becomes a 1-cocycle for some speciﬁc paths γi (cf. [12]). Let σ : K ֒→ Cp be a ﬁeld
embedding and suppose that m is greater than 1. Then the Bloch–Kato logarithm induces
σ : H 1(K, Qp(m)) → DdR,Kσ(Qp(m)) ∼= Kσ ⊂ Cp where Kσ is the
a linear map logBK
topological closure of σ(K) in Cp and DdR,Kσ is a Fontaine functor (cf. [4]). In [12], they
proved the equality called the polylogarithmic Coleman–Ihara formula:

1.3. Finite polylogarithms. There exists a “ﬁnite analog” £m(t) of Lim(z) introduced
by Elbaz-Vincent–Gangl based on Kontsevich’s observation (cf. [3], [9]). This ﬁnite analog
is a polynomial in Fp[t] which is deﬁned by truncating the inﬁnite sum (1) at degree p,
namely,

(4)

£m(t) :=

tn
nm ∈ Fp[t].

p−1Xn=1

A. Besser established an explicit formula connecting the derivative of F p-adic
with £m(t)
in [1]. Let z be an element of W (Fp) such that |z|p = |1 − z|p, where W (Fp) is the ring of
Witt vectors of Fp. Then, Besser showed the following formula:

m

(5)

p1−mDF p-adic

m

(z) ≡ £m−1(Frp(z))

(mod p)

(cf. [1, Theorem 1.1]), where Frp : Fp → Fp is the geometric Frobenius automorphism and
D is the diﬀerential operator deﬁned by D := z(1 − z)d/dz.

In [3], Elbaz-Vincent–Gangl gave a procedure deriving functional equations of ﬁnite
polylogarithms from functional equations of p-adic polylogarithms. The equality (5) plays
a key role in their paper.

If m ≡ m′ (mod p − 1), then we have £m(t) = £m′(t). In other words, the “weight”
of £m(t) is determined up to mod p − 1. However, we can deﬁne a weight of a ﬁnite
polylogarithm as an integer by modifying the deﬁnition as the next subsection.

1.4. Finite multiple polylogarithms. Recently, in the paper [13], the authors intro-
duced a multiple analog of £m(t) in the framework of Kaneko–Zagier (cf. [7], [8]). For
each commutative ring R, we deﬁne a commutative algebra AR by

AR :=   Yp:prime

R/pR!,  Mp:prime

R/pR! .

If R = Z, we omit Z from our notation, that is, A := AZ. Let k1, . . . , km be positive
integers and k := (k1, . . . , km). We call such a tuple k an index. Then, the ﬁnite multiple

that paper. The authors established some functional equations of ﬁnite multiple polylog-
arithms and calculated many special values of them.

1.5. Main result. In this paper, we introduce an ´etale polylogarithm which is an ad´elic
version of Wojtkowiak’s p-adic ´etale polylogarithm. We use the same notation as in Sub-
section 1.2. For each positive integer m, the value li´et
AQ,f ,m(z, γ) of the ´etale polylogarithm
at z will be deﬁned as a continuous function

li´et
AQ,f ,m(z, γ) : GK → AQ,f (m)

where AQ,f (m) is the Tate twist of the ring of ﬁnite ad´eles AQ,f (see Deﬁnition 2.13).
The value of the ﬁnite ´etale polylogarithm £´et
A,m(z, γ) is deﬁned to be the composite
of li´et
AQ,f ,m(z, γ) and AQ,f (m) ։ A(m), where A(m) is the Tate twist of the ring A (see
Deﬁnition 2.16 for the precise deﬁnition). Then, we give an explicit relation between £A,m
and £´et
A,m(z, γ). We deﬁne an algebraic extension Kz of K by Kz := K({ζp, z1/p}p) where p
runs over the rational primes and ζp is a ﬁxed primitive p-th root of unity. Put ζp := (ζp)p
and we sometimes regard ζ ⊗m
A,m(z, γ), we will
introduce the following objects:

(3) An A-linear homomorphism λA(m),Kz : H 1

A,m(z, γ) to GKz is an element of H 1

We show that the restriction of £´et
f (Kz, A(m)) (cf.
Proposition 3.2). The main result of this paper states that “the leading terms” of values
of ﬁnite ´etale polylogarithms coincide with values of ﬁnite polylogarithms multiplied by
certain elementary constants:

cont(Kz, A(m)).

the following congruence holds in ΛA(m),Kz :

Theorem 1.1 (= Theorem 3.4). Let us take the same notation as above. We denote by

The formula in Theorem 1.1 can be regarded as an ´etale analog of Besser’s formula (5).
Furthermore, it also can be regarded as a ﬁnite analog of the polylogarithmic Coleman–
Ihara formula (3). The proof of Theorem 1.1 is based on the explicit formula of ﬁnite ´etale
polylogarithms by Nakamura–Wojtkowiak and the functional equation of ﬁnite multiple
polylogarithms (Proposition A.2). Though ﬁnite multiple polylogarithms do not appear
in the statement of Theorem 1.1, they unexpectedly appear in the proof (see Proposition
4.1).

1.6. Notation. Let K be a ﬁeld of characteristic 0. We denote by µ(K) the set of roots of
unity in K. We ﬁx an algebraic closure K of K and the symbol GK denotes the absolute
Galois group Gal(K/K) of K. Let L be a local ﬁeld or an algebraic extension of Q. Then,
we denote by OL the ring of integers of L. For each locally noetherian aﬃne scheme
Spec(R) and for each topological abelian group A equipped with a continuous action of
the ´etale fundamental group π := π´et
cont(R, A) the
i-th continuous group cohomology H i(π, A). Note that H i
cont(R, A) coincides with the
i-th continuous ´etale cohomology in the sense of Jannsen (cf. [6]) if A is a proﬁnite group
and R is a product of ﬁelds. If A is a ﬁnite group, then we omit the notation “cont” from
our notation because H i
cont(R, A) coincides with the usual ´etale cohomology group of the
´etale sheaf attached to A on Spec(R)´et. We denote by

1 (Spec(R)) of Spec(R), we denote by H i

κn : K ×/(K ×)n ∼−→ H 1(K, Z/nZ(1))

the Kummer map induced by the Kummer sequence

1 → Z/nZ(1) → K

× n−→ K

×

→ 1

where Z/nZ(1) is the group of n-th roots of unity in K. Put bZ(1) := lim
bZ(r) :=bZ(1)⊗r, and AQ,f (r) :=bZ(r) ⊗Z Q for each integer r.

2. ´Etale and finite ´etale multiple polylogarithms

←−n

Z/nZ(1),

In this section, we deﬁne (ﬁnite) ´etale multiple polylogarithms. Recall that the ring A

is deﬁned by the equality

A :=   Yp : primes

Fp!,  Mp : primes

Fp! =  Yp : primes

Fp! ⊗Z Q.

Thus, A can be regarded as a quotient of the ring AQ,f of ﬁnite ad´eles of Q and we
equip A with the quotient topology. One can check that that topology coincides with the
indiscrete topology. Let us introduce Tate twists of the ring A.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let m be an integer. Then, we deﬁne the topological Galois module
A(m) by

A(m) := AQ,f (m) ⊗AQ,f A.

Finite ´etale polylogarithms will be deﬁned as continuous functions on the absolute
Galois group of a number ﬁeld valued in A(m). We regard Fp(m) = Fp(1)⊗m as a discrete

p runs over the rational primes. Then, by deﬁnition, the topology on A(m) coincides with

GK-module for each rational prime p and equipQp Fp(m) with the product topology where
the quotient topology induced by the canonical surjectionQp Fp(m) ։ A(m).

2.1. Cohomology of A(m). Let K be a ﬁeld of characteristic 0. In this subsection, we
study the continuous Galois cohomology of the GK-module A(m). Then we introduce the
ﬁnite part H 1
cont(K, A(m)) and a natural homomorphism from this ﬁnite
part to a certain A-module.

H i (K, Fp(m)) ⊂ Yp

and a positive integer N
annihilating (xp)p. If p is greater than N, the positive integer N is non-zero in Fp. Hence,
the annihilation N(xp)p = (Nxp)p = 0 implies that xp = 0 for all p > N. Thus, we have
the converse inclusion relation.

For a subset Σ of the set of all prime numbers, we deﬁne the closed subgroup CΣ of

numbers when the complement Σc of Σ with respect to the set of all prime numbers is
ﬁnite.

Qp Fp by CΣ :=Qp∈Σ Fp ×Qp6∈Σ{0}. We call Σ a coﬁnite subset of the set of all prime
Lemma 2.3. Every open subgroup of Qp Fp is given by the form CΣ for some coﬁnite
Proof. Let U be an open subgroup of Qp Fp. Then, there exists a coﬁnite subset Σ of
fundamental system of 0 inQp Fp. We ﬁx such a Σ and regard U := U/CΣ as a subgroup
ofLp∈Σc Fp via the canonical isomorphismLp∈Σc Fp
∼−→Qp Fp/CΣ. For p ∈ Σc, we deﬁne
an integer ap by ap :=Qq∈Σc,q6=p q and
{0} ⊂Mp∈Σc
Fp ։ Fp ⊕ MΣc\{p}

the set of all prime numbers such that U contains CΣ, since such open subgroups form a

αp : Mp∈Σc

Fp

by αp(x) := apx. For u = (up)p ∈ U, we see that u′ := (a−1
p up)p ∈ U . Indeed, by the
Chinese remainder theorem, there exsists an integer n such that nu = u′. Therefore, we

have U =Lp∈Σc αp(U), since up = αp(u′) holds. Let Σ′ be the subset of Σc consisting of

p such that the p-component of some element of U is non-zero. Since αp(U ) is a subgroup
of the cyclic group Fp, αp(U) = Fp if p ∈ Σ′ and αp(U) = {0} if p ∈ Σc \ Σ′. Hence, we
have U = CΣ∪Σ′ and Σ ∪ Σ′ is coﬁnite.

Lemma 2.4. Let G be a proﬁnite group and H its closed subgroup. Then, H is equal to
the intersection of all open subgroups of G containing H.

Proof. Let x be an element of G \ H. Then, there exists an open normal subgroup U of G
containing x and xU and H are disjoint. Since HU is an open subgroup of G satisfying
x 6∈ HU and H ⊂ HU, x is not an element of the intersection of all open subgroups of G
containing H.

Proposition 2.5. Every closed subgroup ofQp Fp is given by the form CΣ for some subset

a family {Σλ}λ∈Λ of coﬁnite subsets of the set of all prime numbers such that

SinceTλ∈Λ CΣλ = CΣ where Σ =Tλ∈Λ Σλ, we have the conclusion.
Corollary 2.6. Let C be a closed subgroup of Qp Fp. Then, every element of C has a

ﬁnite order if and only if C is a ﬁnite group.

Proof. By Proposition 2.5, C = CΣ holds for some subset Σ of all prime numbers. If Σ is
an inﬁnite set, the element (εp)p of CΣ has an inﬁnite order, where εp = 1 (resp. 0) for
p ∈ Σ (resp. p 6∈ Σ). Therefore, if every element of CΣ has a ﬁnite order, then CΣ is a
ﬁnite set. The converse assertion is clear.

Proposition 2.7. Let m be an integer. We assume that K contains µp for any prime
number p, where µp is the set of all p-th roots of unity in K. Then, the canonical homo-

Proof. Note that

H 1

Im(f ) has a ﬁnite order. Since f is a continuous homomorphism of proﬁnite groups,

hold by the assumption of K. Let f : GK →Qp Fp(m) be a continuous homomorphism
such that the composite of f and Qp Fp(m) → A(m) is zero. Then, every element of
Im(f ) is a closed subgroup ofQp Fp(m). Therefore, Im(f ) is a ﬁnite group by Corollary
2.6 and this implies that f is an element ofLp Homcont(GK, Fp(m)).

Note that the inclusion ιA is not surjective in general.
We introduce a correction of local conditions of H 1

cont(K, A(m)). For the rest of this
subsection, we suppose that K is an algebraic extension of Q. Then, for each rational
prime p, we put Kp := K ⊗Q Qp and deﬁne its subring OKp by OKp := OK ⊗Z Zp.

p-adic logarithm normalized as logp(p) = 0 (cf.
[17, Proposition 5.4]) and M a subﬁeld
of K which is ﬁnite over Q. For each place v of M over p, we denote by Mv the v-adic
completion of M and by Λv,M the Zp-submodule logp(O×

2.2. Deﬁnition of ´etale and ﬁnite ´etale multiple polylogarithms. In this subsec-
tion, we introduce the (ﬁnite) ´etale multiple polylogarithms. Suppose that K is a subﬁeld
of C. Let X be P1
1 (X) the maximal pronilpotent quotient of the ´etale

01) (cf. [5, Section 6]). Let us take a standard set of
−→
generators {x, y} of π´et
01) as in [5, Section 2.3]. Then, x determines a coherent
system of roots of unity (ζn)n>0, ζn ∈ C. We regard this coherent system as a basis of

1 (X ⊗K K,
1 (X ⊗K K,

K \ {0, 1, ∞} and πnil

bZ(1). We deﬁne the multiplicative embedding

ι : πnil

1 (X) ֒→ AQ,f hhA, Bii

1 (X) to the non-commutative formal power series over the ring of ﬁnite ad´eles in

of πnil
variables A, B by

For z ∈ K and for an ´etale path γ in X ⊗K K from

(cf. [5, (2.3.1)]). Note that the constant term of ι(fγ(σ)) is equal to 1 for any σ ∈ GK.
Hence, the inﬁnite sum

log(ι(fγ(σ))) :=

(−1)n−1(ι(fγ(σ)) − 1)n

∞Xn=1

converges in AQ,f hhA, Bii. Moreover, it is a Lie-like element of AQ,f hhA, Bii. We ﬁx a
Hall family H in the free magma generated by {A, B} (cf. [14, Deﬁnition 5.1]). Here we
choose an order on H so that A < B. It is well-known that H is a topological free basis
of the set of Lie-like elements in AQ,f hhA, Bii (cf. [14, Theorem 5.3]). For later use, we
deﬁne a special element em for each positive integer m by

e1 := B,

em := [A, em−1] ∈ H .

For each h ∈ H , the weight of h is deﬁned to be the length of the word corresponding to
h. Thus, the weight of em is equal to m.

Deﬁnition 2.13. Let h be an element of H of weight w. Let z be an element of
−→
P1(K) \ {0, 1, ∞} and γ an ´etale path from
01 to z. Then, we deﬁne the value at z of the
´etale multiple polylogarithm

attached to γ by

li´et
AQ,f ,h(z, γ) : GK → AQ,f (w)

AQ,f ,h(z, γ)(σ) := (the coeﬃcient of log (ι(fγ(σ))) at h) ⊗ (ζn)⊗w

sense of Wojtkowiak (see [19] ).

Remark 2.15. For each positive integer m, the continuous map lip,em(z, γ) coincides with
Wojtkowiak’s p-adic polylogarithm lm(z)γ multiplied by (−1)m−1 (cf. [20, Deﬁnition 11.0.1]).

Now we deﬁne an ´etale analog of the ﬁnite multiple polylogarithm.

Deﬁnition 2.16. For each h ∈ H of weight w, we deﬁne the continuous map

£´et

A,h(z, γ) : GK → A(w)

to be the composite of li´et
We call £´et

A,h(z, γ) the value at z of the ﬁnite ´etale multiple polylogarithm attached to

For each rational prime p, we deﬁne the continuous map

to be the mod p of lip,h(z, γ). We put £´et

3. Main result: an explicit formula of finite ´etale polylogarithms
We describe £´et

A,m(z, γ) by £A,m(t) for any positive integer m.

In this and the next

section, we ﬁx a number ﬁeld K contained in C. For each z ∈ K \ {0, 1}, we put

Kz := K(cid:0){µp, z1/p | p : rational primes}(cid:1) ,

where µp is the set of all p-th roots of unity in K.

The following explicit description of £´et

p,m(z, γ) is fundamental to prove the main result.

Proposition 3.1 ([10, Section 3, Corollary]). Let m be a positive integer. Let z be an
−→
01 to z. Let z1/p be the
element of K \ {0, 1} and γ an ´etale path in P1
−→
01   z and put
p-th root of z determined by γ :

where we understand 00 = 1 when m = 1 and i = 0. Then, the equality

KENJI SAKUGAWA AND SHIN-ICHIRO SEKI

Proposition 3.2. Let us take the same notation as in Proposition 3.1. The restriction
of the m-th ﬁnite ´etale polylogarithm £´et
A,m(z, γ) to the absolute Galois group GKz of Kz
is a continuous group homomorphism. Furthermore, it is contained in the ﬁnite part
H 1

f (Kz, A(m)).

Proof. The continuous function £´et

A,m(z, γ) is represented by a continuous map

Yp>m

£´et

p,m(z, γ) : GK → Yp>m

Fp(m).

Hence, the restriction of £´et
this proposition, it is suﬃcient to show that the restriction of £´et
fundamental group of Spec(Kz,p) is contained in the image of

A,m(z, γ) to GKz is contained in Im(ιA). Therefore, to prove
p,m(z, γ) to the ´etale

κp : O×

Kz,p → H 1(Kz, Fp(m)).

Therefore, by Proposition 3.1, it is suﬃcient to show that wp,m(z, γ) is a p-unit for almost
all p. By the deﬁnition of wp,m(z, γ), it holds that wp,m(z, γ) is a p-unit if 1 − z is a p-unit.
Hence, we have the conclusion.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.3. By Proposition 3.1, if z is contained in µ(K) \ {1}, then £´et
p,m(z, γ) is the
mod p of a cyclotomic Soul´e element multiplied by 1/(m − 1)! (cf. [20, Corollary 14.3.3]).

We denote by ζp the element (ζp)p of Qp OKz . The main result of this paper is as

We prove this theorem in the next subsection. By Theorem 3.4, we have a new proof

of the following well-known fact.

Corollary 3.5 (cf. [15, Corollary 3.2]). Assume that p is an odd regular prime. Then,
for any odd integer m such that 1 < m < p − 1, the restriction map

resm : H 1

cont(Qp, Zp(m))

is an isomorphism.

This corollary will be proved in Section 5.

4. Proof of Theorem 3.4

In this section, we show the congruence (10) for suﬃciently large prime p. More pre-
cisely, we suppose that p is greater than m + 1 and unramiﬁed in K such that z and 1 − z
are p-units. We ﬁx such a rational prime p and a place v of K over p. Put F := Kv.
Then, F is unramiﬁed over Qp by assumption. Let z1/p be the p-th root of z determined
by the ﬁxed path γ :

−→
01   z. We deﬁne the local ﬁeld Fz by

First of all, we observe that the following proposition implies Theorem 3.4 (10):

Fz := F (z1/p, ζp) = Kv(z1/p, ζp).

Proposition 4.1. We have the following congruence in OFz :

logp(wp,m(z, γ)) ≡ (−1)m−1(m−1)!(ζp −1)p−m£⋆

p,{1}m(cid:18)

1

1 − z−1/p(cid:19) (cid:16)mod (ζp −1)p−m+1(cid:17).

Here, £⋆

p,{1}m(t) is the p-component of £⋆

A,{1}m(t) and {1}m denotes m repetition of 1.

Proof of Theorem 3.4 assuming Proposition 4.1. By the case k = {1}m of Proposition
A.2, we have

£⋆

p,{1}m(cid:18)

1

1 − z−1/p(cid:19) ≡

1

z − 1

£p,m(z1/p)

(mod pOFz ).

Thus, the assertion of Theorem 3.4 is a direct consequence of Proposition 4.1 and Propo-
sition 3.1.
(cid:3)

We need to prepare some auxiliary lemmas.

Lemma 4.2. Let n and j be positive integers less than p. Then, the following congruence
holds in Z(p)[ζp] :

inζ ij

p ≡

(−1)n−1n!p
jn(ζp − 1)n

Proof. We remark that ζ j
a, b, c ∈ Z(p)[ζp], we obtain the following equalities:

p − 1 is congruent to j(ζp − 1) mod (ζp − 1)2. Hence, for some

Lemma 4.3. The element logp(1 − z1/p) is contained in OFz .

Proof. We write z = ζu with some ζ ∈ µ(F ) \ {1} and some principal unit u ∈ 1 + pOF .
Put ζ ′ := ζ 1/p/(1 − ζ 1/p) and ̟ := u1/p − 1. One can check that the p-adic valuation of
̟ is greater than or equal to 1/p. Then, 1 − z1/p = (1 − ζ 1/p)(1 − ζ ′̟) and we have

logp(1 − z1/p) = logp(1 − ζ 1/p) −

Let vp be the p-adic valuation of Fz normalized as vp(p) = 1. Since vp((ζ ′̟)n/n) =

F under logp is contained in pOF , we obtain the
conclusion of the lemma.

5. Applications of Theorem 3.4

In this section, we give applications of Theorem 3.4. We prepare some lemmas about
the divisibility of elements in local ﬁelds. For any ﬁeld L, we denote by µ(L)(p) the set of
roots of unity of L whose orders are prime to p.

Lemma 5.1. Let L be a ﬁnite extension of Qp and π a prime element of OL. Let
n=n0 anπn be a principal unit of L with an ∈ µ(L)(p) ∪ {0} and let n0 ∈ Z>0
be the minimal positive integer such that an0 6= 0. If n0 is not divided by p and less than

x = 1 +P∞

FINITE AND ´ETALE POLYLOGARITHMS

15

vL(p), then any p-th root of x is not contained in L. Here, vL is the discrete valuation of
L normalized as vL(π) = 1.

Proof. Assume that a p-th root of x, say y, is contained in L. Then, y is also a principal
unit of L. Write y = 1 + bπn with n ∈ Z>0 and b ∈ O×
L . Then, yp = x is equal to
1 + bpπnp + pz for some z ∈ OL. Therefore, n0 is divided by p or greater than or equal to
vL(p).
(cid:3)

Now, we return to the setting in Section 4. Let F be Kv which is a ﬁnite unramiﬁed
extension of Qp and let z = ζu ∈ O×
F ) with u ∈ 1 + pOF and ζ ∈ µ(F )(p) \ {1}.
Furthermore, we suppose that u ∈ 1 + p2OF . Then, we have Fz = F (µp) and π := ζp − 1
is a prime element of OFz . For each x ∈ F ×

z , we denote the π-adic expansion of x by

F ∩ (1 + O×

x =Xn

an(x)πn,

an(x) ∈ µ(F ) ∪ {0}.

Note that an(x) is uniquely determined by x and π.

Proposition 5.2. Let x be a unit of OFz . Assume that vp(logp(x)) > 1/(p − 1) and
an(logp(x)) 6= 0 with some integer n such that 1 < n < p − 1. Then, any p-th root of x is
not contained in Fz. In particular, the cohomology class κp(x) ⊗ ζ ⊗(m−1)
∈ H 1(Fz, Fp(m))
is non-zero.

p

Proof. Let exp(X) be the formal power seriesP∞

X n
n! . Note that, if the p-adic valuation
of y ∈ Cp is greater than 1/(p−1), then the series exp(y) converges. Set x′ := exp(logp(x)).
Then, ζ := x/x′ is a root of unity in Fz because it is contained in the kernel of logp (cf.
[17, Proposition 5.6]). Therefore, it is suﬃcient to show that any p-th root of ζ r
px′ is not
contained in Fz for any integer r.

n=0

By the assumption for logp(x), an(x′) is non-zero for some integer n satisfying 1 < n <
px′) 6= 0 for any integer r prime
px′,
px′ is not contained in Fz for any integer r. Thus, we have

p − 1. On the other hand, since a1(x′) = 0, we have a1(ζ r
to p. Hence, by applying Lemma 5.1 to the case where F = Fz, π = ζp − 1 and x = ζ r
we see that any p-th root of ζ r

cont(L, Zp(m)) is torsion free.

Lemma 5.4. Let L be Z[1/p] or Qp and let m be a positive integer which is not divided
by p − 1. Then, the canonical map H 1
cont(L, Qp(m)) is injective. In
particular, the Zp-module H 1
Proof. We note that the GL-invariant part of µ⊗m
vanishes. Indeed, GL acts on the 1-
dimensional Fp-vector space µ⊗m
via the m-th power ωm of the Teichm¨uller character ω
and the order of ω on GL is p − 1. By taking GL-invariant part of the exact sequence
p
0 → µ⊗m
−→ Qp/Zp(m) → 0, we see that H 0(L, Qp/Zp(m)) has no non-
trivial p-torsion element. Since any element of H 0(L, Qp/Zp(m)) is a p-power torsion
element, we have H 0(L, Qp/Zp(m)) = 0. This implies that the natural homomorphism

is non-trivial.

Proof. By the local and global Euler–Poincar´e characteristics of Galois cohomology, the
ranks of H 1
cont(Qp, Qp(m)) are equal to 1. Hence, by Lemma 5.4,
H 1
cont(Qp, Zp(m)) are free Zp-modules of rank one. Therefore
resm is an isomorphism if and only if

cont(Z[1/p], Zp(m)) and H 1

cont(Z[1/p], Qp(m)) and H 1

resm : H 1

cont(Z[1/p], Zp(m)) → H 1

cont(Qp, Zp(m))/pH 1

cont(Qp, Zp(m))

is non-trivial. Therefore, if (15) is non-trivial, then resm is also non-trivial because the
homomorphism (15) factors through resm. This completes the proof of the lemma.

Now, let K := Q, so F = Qp.

p,m(−1, γ) to GQp(ζp) is contained in the image under the composite

cont(Z[1/p], Zp(m)) → H 1

According to Corollary 5.3, it is suﬃcient to show that a1 = 0 and an 6= 0 for some

mod ζp − 1 for any integer n. Since 1 < p − m < p, it is suﬃcient to show that £p,m (−1)
mod p is non-zero. By [13, Lemma 4.1 (58)], the value £p,m(−1) is congruent with
1−2m−1
2m−2m Bp−m mod p. Therefore if p is regular, then £p,m(−1) 6≡ 0 (mod p) so £´et
p,m(−1, γ)

p(cid:1) is congruent with £p,m (−1)

By using Proposition 3.1 and Proposition 4.1, we can deduce vanishing results for the
ﬁnite multiple polylogarithms from facts about Galois cohomology. For example, we give
another proof of a part of [13, Proposition 4.3 (58)] which is a generalization of [16,
Theorem 1.1 (1.1)] without using the functional equation:

Corollary 5.6. If m is an even positive integer, then we have

A,{1}m(1/2) = 0.

cont(Z[1/p], Zp(m)) vanishes ([15, Theorem 1]). Hence, £´et

Proof. Let p be a suﬃciently large prime. As m is even, the global Galois cohomology
H 1
p,m(−1, γ) vanishes because it is
contained in the image under the mod p restriction map (cf. Proof of Corollary 3.5). Thus,
by Proposition 4.1 and Proposition 5.2, “the leading term” £⋆
p,m(−1, γ)

We can also obtain an another proof of a part of [13, Theorem 3.22 (55)] by the distri-

bution properties about the cyclotomic Soul´e elements ([21, Corollary 14.3.4]).

Appendix A. A functional equation of finite multiple polylogarithms

In this appendix, we prove a functional equaiton of one-variable ﬁnite multiple poly-
logarithms for the proof of Theorem 3.4. The following theorem is a special case of main
results of [13]:

tions hold in AZ[t] for any index k :
