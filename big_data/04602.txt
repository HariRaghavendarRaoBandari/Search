ABSTRACT

This is the second paper in a series of catalogues of 22-GHz water maser obser-
vations towards the 6.7-GHz methanol masers from the Methanol Multibeam (MMB)
Survey. In this paper we present our water maser observations made with the Aus-
tralia Telescope Compact Array towards the masers from the MMB survey between
l = 341◦ through the Galactic centre to l = 6◦. Of the 204 6.7-GHz methanol masers
in this longitude range we found 101 to have associated water maser emission (∼ 50
per cent). We found no diﬀerence in the 6.7-GHz methanol maser luminosities of those
with and without water masers. In sources where both maser species are observed, the
luminosities of the methanol and water masers are weakly correlated. Studying the
mid-infrared colours from GLIMPSE we found no diﬀerences between the colours of
those sources associated with both methanol and water masers and those associated
with just methanol. Comparing the column density and dust mass calculated from the
870-µm thermal dust emission observed by ATLASGAL, we found no diﬀerences be-
tween those sources associated with both water and methanol masers and those with
methanol only. Since water masers are collisionally pumped and often show emission
further away from their accompanying YSO than the radiatively pumped 6.7-GHz
methanol masers, it is likely water masers are not as tightly correlated to the evolu-
tion of the parent YSO and so do not trace such a well deﬁned evolutionary state as
6.7-GHz methanol masers.

INTRODUCTION

Masers are useful tools for studying star formation as they
are bright, intense and observable at radio frequencies, thus
allowing us to see into the dusty environments of young stel-
lar objects.

Water masers were ﬁrst discovered by Cheung et al.
(1969) towards Sgr B2, Orion A and W49 and are now
known to be the most widespread of the known maser
species (e.g. Walsh et al. 2011). They are found within the
envelopes of evolved asymptotic giant branch stars and
around young stellar objects. For water masers accompa-
nying high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs), VLBI obser-
vations have shown that they are found the disks surround-
ing them (Torrelles et al. 1998), in their high velocity bipo-
lar outﬂows (e.g. Genzel et al. 1981; Hofner & Churchwell
1996) and in bow shocks from outﬂows and expanding shells
(Hofner & Churchwell 1996; Carrasco-Gonz´alez et al. 2015).

The 22-GHz water maser 61,6 → 52,3 rotational transi-
tion is the brightest spectral line at radio frequencies and
shows much greater temporal variability than those of other
species (Brand et al. 2003). Other transitions of water have
also been observed, especially the higher frequency vibra-
tional transitions towards evolved stars (Menten & Melnick
1989). Water masers are pumped by collisions with H2
molecules within shocks associated with outﬂows or accre-
tion (Elitzur et al. 1989; Garay & Lizano 1999) and may
reside further away from their parent YSO than 6.7-GHz
methanol masers (see Forster & Caswell (1989) c.f. Caswell
(1997)).

by collisions with molecular hydrogen, whereas the class
II methanol masers are pumped by infrared radiation (e.g.
Cragg et al. 1992, 2002; Voronkov et al. 2005).

6.7-GHz methanol masers make ideal candidates to
study the conditions at the sites of young, high-mass stars
as they are found exclusively at sites of high-mass star for-
mation (Pestalozzi et al. 2002; Minier et al. 2003; Xu et al.
2008; Breen et al. 2013). The Methanol Multibeam (MMB)
survey was conducted to make an unbiased survey of the
Galactic plane for 6.7-GHz methanol masers. The MMB cov-
ered the entire Galactic Plane observable with the Parkes
64-m dish in Australia (longitudes 186◦, through 0◦, to 60◦)
with latitude coverage of |b| ≤ 2◦. For sources without inter-
ferometric positions already available, the detections were
followed-up with the Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA) and the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferom-
eter Network (MERLIN) to obtain precise positions. Cata-
logues covering the entire MMB region have now been pub-
lished (Green et al. 2009; Caswell et al. 2010; Green et al.
2010; Caswell et al. 2011; Green et al. 2012; Breen et al.
2015).

Another large-scale, unbiased survey for masers is the
H2O southern Galactic Plane Survey (HOPS; Walsh et al.
2011, 2014). HOPS surveyed 100 deg2 of our Galaxy for wa-
ter masers and many other molecular lines with the Mopra
Radio Telescope and the water maser detections were sub-
sequently followed-up with the ATCA. HOPS is ideal for
studying water masers in all the diﬀerent environments that
they form, however, for comparison with the MMB it lacks
sensitivity (HOPS is estimated to be 98 per cent complete
down to 8.4 Jy compared to the the MMB which is estimated
to be approaching 100 per cent completeness at 1 Jy).

It has been proposed (e.g. Ellingsen et al. 2013;
Breen et al. 2010b; Ellingsen et al. 2007) that the presence
and/or absence of diﬀerent maser transitions correspond to
diﬀerent evolutionary stages of the parent YSO. Masers can
be associated with ultra-compact HII regions (Phillips et al.
1998; Walsh et al. 1998) and at younger stages embedded
within infrared dark clouds (Ellingsen 2006). Breen et al.
(2010b) have shown that YSO with only 6.7-GHz methanol
masers are at an earlier stage of evolution than those with
12.2-GHz methanol and OH masers. How water masers ﬁt
into this evolutionary sequence remains unclear. There is
now some evidence that water masers may not ﬁt such a well
deﬁned evolutionary stage as other types of masers. Water
masers can be found at a wider range of projected phys-
ical separations from their associated YSOs, and so may
not always be closely tied to the physical conditions there
(Breen et al. 2014; Titmarsh et al. 2014).

The conditions under which methanol and water masers
form are also very diﬀerent. 6.7-GHz methanol masers ben-
eﬁt from strong background radiation, however, this is not
needed for 22-GHz water masers to exist and modelling sug-
gests that this may even suppress them. In addition, af-
ter shock destruction, water masers re-form quickly (e.g.
Hollenbach et al. 2013) whereas, methanol forms slowly on
dust grains (Dartois et al. 1999) and once it has been de-
stroyed it is lost in that region during that star formation
episode. Water and methanol masers also have very diﬀerent
excitation temperatures (∼49 K and ∼646 K respectively)
and conditions for strong inversion. The 6.7-GHz methanol
masers are found in dust temperatures of < 500 K and their

ideal number densities are 1012 m−3 – 1013 m−3 and are
quenched at > 1014 m−3 (Sobolev et al. 1997). These tem-
peratures and densities are at the bottom of the range of
conditions water masers can be found in. They can be found
under a wide range of conditions, but they most favour
temperatures of ∼800 K and number densities of 1015 m−3
(Gray et al. 2016).
Since masers are found within the dusty envelopes of
high-mass star formation, is it useful to compare maser data
to the thermal dust emission. Dust emission is optically thin
at submillimetre wavelengths and is useful for tracing col-
umn densities and clump masses. Submillimetre emission al-
lows us to study the coldest, densest regions where stars are
forming. Recently, there have been two large, unbiased sur-
veys of the Galactic Plane in the submillimetre regime. The
Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS; Rosolowsky et al.
2010) at 1.1 mm and the APEX Telescope Large Area
Survey of the GALaxy (ATLASGAL; Schuller et al. 2009;
Contreras et al. 2013; Csengeri et al. 2014) at 870 µm.

In this paper we report the 22-GHz water maser follow-
up of the MMB in the longitude range l = 341◦ through the
Galactic centre to l = 6◦. All the MMB sources in the range
l = 310◦ − 341◦ have also been observed for water masers.
In addition, during all our MMB follow-up observations we
also observed the ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) transitions and,
when available, an additional 2 x 2 GHz continuum bands
with 32 x 64 MHz channels. The rest of the water maser
data ammonia and continuum observations will be reported
in future publications.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

The observing strategy for the water maser follow-up of the
MMB survey is described in detail in Titmarsh et al. (2014).
Here we only repeat the essential details.

We targeted all the MMB sources for water maser emis-
sion in the range l = 341◦ through the Galactic centre to
l = 6◦, including those that had been observed before, with
the ATCA. We re-observed those that had been targeted
before to ensure that we had a statistically complete sam-
ple of water masers at one epoch. The sources in the range
l = 341◦ − 2◦ were observed with the H214 array conﬁg-
uration on 2011 June 3-5 and l = 2◦ − 6◦ were observed
using the H168 conﬁguration on 2011 August 8. At 22 GHz
the primary beam of the ATCA is 2.1 arcminutes and the
synthesised beam of the H214 and H168 conﬁgurations are
∼ 9.6 and ∼ 12.4 arcseconds respectively.
For calibration we used PKS B1934-638 for the pri-
mary ﬂux density, PKS B1253-055 for the bandpass and
PKS B1646-50 for the phase calibrator on the 2011 June
3 observations and PKS B1714-336 for the 2011 June 4-5
and August 8 observations. We spent 1.5 minutes observ-
ing the phase calibrator every ∼ 10 minutes and in between
we observed groups of six nearby MMB targets for 1.5 min-
utes each. Each target was observed at least 4 times, giving
a total on-source time of ≥ 6 minutes, over an hour angle
range of six hours or more to ensure suﬃcient uv -coverage
for imaging.

We used the Compact Array Broadband Backend
(CABB; Wilson et al. 2011) with two zoom bands of 64 MHz
bandwidth with 2048 spectral channels. We centred the ﬁrst

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

band at the 22.235-GHz water maser transition and the sec-
ond half-way between the ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) transi-
tions at 23.708 GHz. This corresponded to a channel width
in velocity of 0.42 km s−1 and 0.39 km s−1 for the water and
ammonia bands respectively and velocity resolutions for uni-
form weighting of the spectral channels of 0.50 km s−1 and
0.47 km s−1 and velocity coverages of > 800 km s−1. The 5 σ
detection limit for these observations ranged from ∼125 mJy
- ∼250 mJy depending on weather conditions and total time
on-source. In addition 2 x 2 GHz continuum bands with 32
x 64 MHz channels were available for the 2011 August ob-
servations.

The water maser data were reduced in miriad
(Sault et al. 1995) using standard techniques for ATCA
spectral line data and all the velocities were corrected to
the Local Standard of Rest. We inspected the image cubes
within an arcminute radius of each methanol maser position
to ﬁnd the associated water masers and the spectra were
produced from these image cubes by integrating the emis-
sion at each maser site.

For masers previously observed with the ATCA by
(Breen et al. 2010a), our positions agreed to within ≤ 2 arc-
seconds. The astrometric accuracy of ATCA measurements
of water masers is, under ideal conditions, around 0.4 arcsec-
onds (Caswell 1997) and is set by the precision to which the
coordinates of the phase calibrators have been measured and
other systematics such as the antenna positions. For obser-
vations at 22 GHz, varying water vapour content in the at-
mosphere degrades the phase calibration and the typical as-
trometric accuracy for the current observations is estimated
to be within an arcsecond in good weather conditions.

Many maser sites consist of a collection of emission
”spots”. The spread of the maser spots also limits the po-
sitional accuracy we can achieve for each maser site since
there is some physical scatter of these spots. Hence, the mea-
sured position of the maser site can change as water masers
are variable and a diﬀerent spot may now be the strongest.
However, from epoch to epoch we expect the change due to
scatter in the strongest maser spots to be of the same order
as the astrometric accuracy or lower.

3 RESULTS

Here we report the 22-GHz water masers detected towards
the 6.7-GHz methanol masers in the Galactic longitude
range 341◦ to 6◦. We found 101 of the 204 MMB sources
in this range to have associated water maser emission (∼ 50
per cent). Figure 1 shows a histogram of the oﬀsets between
the target methanol masers and the water masers detected
around them. We have used an oﬀset of ≤ 3.0 arcseconds
from the 6.7-GHz methanol maser to establish association
with the exception of G05.885–0.393 (for details see Section
3.1). Note: 3 arcseconds is not the positional uncertainty
of our maser sites, rather the angular separation we deem
reasonable to determine if masers are associated with the
same YSO. We have used a 3 arcsecond criteria in this pa-
per and in Titmarsh et al. (2014) as it will include all the
real associations and is consistent with what has been used
in other large, high resolution surveys of water masers with
the ATCA such as Breen et al. (2010a) and Caswell et al.
(2010). The spectra of the associated water masers taken

with the ATCA are presented in Figure A1 and comments
on individual sources of interest are in Section 3.1. We have
only determined maser associations based on their angular
separation. We did not use their velocities as water masers
are well known for showing emission a long way from the
systemic velocity of the region often spanning many tens to
hundreds of km s−1.

We have looked at the distributions of the physical sep-
arations in the plane of the sky as we have good distance
estimates to these masers. The distances were taken from
Green & McClure-Griﬃths (2011) or Motogi et al. (2011)
where available, of which a few are astrometric distances
but the majority are the kinematic distances with the near-
far ambiguity resolved using HI self-absorption. For the re-
maining sources we used the 6.7-GHz methanol peak veloc-
ities and the Reid et al. (2009) rotation curve to estimate
their distances. For 15 sources the Reid et al. (2009) rotation
curve produced very unrealistic distance estimates, partic-
ularly near the Galactic centre where non-circular motions
are large. For these sources we used estimates which utilise
a Baysian approach which takes into account a range of dis-
tance estimations including any trigonometric parallax dis-
tances of nearby sources, CO and kinematic distances (Mark
Reid, private communication).

The distribution of projected distances between the
methanol and water masers is given in Figure 2. Given the
varying distances to the masers, determining association
based on linear separations is desirable, however for ease
of comparison with previous work and consistency with the
previous instalment of this catalogue, we have used the 3
arcsecond angular separation criteria. This will make little
diﬀerence to our results as most of the water masers we have
classiﬁed as associated are within 0.05 pc of their methanol
maser and all are within 0.2 pc. There are a small number
of masers that we have classiﬁed as not associated within
0.05 pc. A couple are separated by less than 3 arcseconds,
however, these were close pairs of methanol masers with only
one water maser detected (within 3 arcseconds of both of
them) and the water masers have been assigned to the clos-
est methanol maser. The rest have separations greater than
3 arcseconds. Further analysis of linear separations has been
left to future publications.

The results of the search are summarised in Table 1:
column 1 gives the source name (Galactic Longitude and
Latitude) of the target 6.7-GHz methanol maser; columns 2
and 3 give the position of the water maser in Right Ascen-
sion and Declination (J2000); column 4 the peak velocity;
columns 5 and 6 the minimum and maximum velocities of
the emission; column 7 the peak ﬂux densities; column 8
the integrated ﬂux densities; columns 9, 10 and 11 the peak,
minimum and maximum velocities of the associated 6.7-GHz
methanol masers; column 12 the angular oﬀsets; column 13
the epoch of the water observations and column 14 lists the
distances to the MMB sources.

Column 15 of Table 1 lists the associations with 12.2-
GHz methanol and OH masers from Breen et al. (2012);
Caswell (1998) and Caswell et al. (2013). Note that the 12.2-
GHz associations are complete, coming from targeted obser-
vations towards the MMB sources. The OH observations are
not complete towards all the MMB sources. Caswell (1998)
surveyed the Galactic Plane between l = 312◦ − 356◦ and
|b| < 0.6◦ and will have detected most of the masers above

∼3 Jy and we have indicated MMB sources that lie within
the area of this survey, but no OH emission was detected.
Also indicated in this column, are sources that were observed
for water maser emission in Breen et al. (2010a).

MMB targets for which no associated water maser emis-
sion was detected are presented in Table 2. Column 1 is the
source name of the target MMB maser; column 2 is the 5σ
detection limit; columns 3, 4 and 5 are the epochs, asso-
ciations and distances respectively, the same as for Table
1. Since water masers are variable, some of these methanol
maser targets have been found to have water maser emission
in past studies. The 15 sources where this has occurred were
observed by Breen et al. (2010a) to be associated with the
target methanol masers and are discussed in Section 3.1 and
in Section 4.3. Extending to a multi-epoch search by includ-
ing these sources with the ones in Table 1, we can partially
account for variability over several years and increase to a
detection rate of ∼ 56 per cent.

3.1 Comments on individual sites of maser

emission

341.218–0.212. This water maser showed strong variation in
its ﬂux density, with a peak ﬂux density of 120 Jy in 2003
and 33 Jy in the 2004 observations of Breen et al. (2010a).
In our observations in 2011 it had increased again to 106. Jy.
Although the intensity varied greatly, the velocities of the
emission remained similar over these three epochs.

345.003–0.223

and

345.003–0.224. This pair

of
methanol masers has been found to show variability in both
sites (Caswell et al. 1995). Goedhart et al. (2004) monitored
these methanol masers over more than four years and found
no periodicities on these timescales. The water maser asso-
ciated with 345.003–0.223 was also detected by Breen et al.
(2010a) in 2003 to have a peak ﬂux density of 3.0 Jy, in 2004
at 3.7 Jy. It had two main features and Breen et al. (2010a)
found the peak to be the feature at 15 kms−1, but in our
observations in 2011 the other feature at -83.6 kms−1 had
ﬂared to 11.3 Jy to become the peak.

345.010+1.792 and 345.012+1.797. 345.010+1.792 is
associated with an UCHII region (Caswell 1997), and many
other class II methanol maser transitions (Ellingsen et al.
2012). Breen et al. (2010a) detected water maser emission
in 2003 with a peak ﬂux density of 2.0 Jy, but it was
not detected in their 2004 observations (detection limit of
0.2 Jy) or in our observations. 345.012+1.797 was observed
by Breen et al. (2010a) in 2003 and 2004 and in our obser-
vations to have peak ﬂux densities of 50, 29 and 88.7 Jy,
respectively.

349.092+0.106. This water maser showed strong vari-
ation in its ﬂux density, with a peak ﬂux density of 34 Jy
in 2003 and 154 Jy in the 2004 observations of Breen et al.
(2010a). In our observations in 2011 it had decreased again
to 15.8 Jy. Although the intensity varied greatly, the overall
shape of the spectra remained similar with the peak velocity
at ∼80 kms−1 in all three epochs.
351.417+0.645. In 2003 this water maser had peak ﬂux
density of 1400 Jy by (Breen et al. 2010a, note it was not
observed by them in 2004). In our observations its peak ﬂux
density had decreased to 156. Jy, and the peak was a diﬀer-
ent feature. The spectra at both epochs had many features,
but the spectra in 2003 had a larger total velocity range than
in 2011 (-58 to 50 kms−1 compared to -43.4 to 13.7 kms−1).
351.581–0.353. In 2003 this water maser had peak ﬂux
density of 1600 Jy observed by Breen et al. (2010a) (note it
was not observed by them in 2004). In our observations in
2011 the spectra maintained similar velocities although its
peak ﬂux density had decreased to 110. Jy.

352.630–1.067. This water maser showed strong varia-
tion in its ﬂux density, with a peak ﬂux density of 35 Jy
in 2003 and 700 Jy in the 2004 observations of Breen et al.
(2010a). The peak feature was in the centre of the spec-
tra ∼0 kms−1 for the Breen et al. (2010a) observations and
only this feature showed showed strong variation with the
features on either side remaining similar in each epoch. In
our observations the peak feature was at 10.6 kms−1 (peak
ﬂux density of 14.1 Jy) and the central feature at ∼0 kms−1
had decreased to ∼10 Jy.
353.273+0.641. This water maser was identiﬁed by
Caswell & Phillips (2008) to be associated with an unusual
water maser dominated by a blue-shifted outﬂow. It was ob-

served by Breen et al. (2010a) in 2004 with peak ﬂux density
of 366 Jy, in 2007 by Caswell & Phillips (2008) with a peak
of 45 Jy and in our observations in 2011 with a peak ﬂux
density of 182. Jy. It remained dominated by the blue-shifted
emission at all epochs with the strongest emission coming
from the features clustered around ∼50 kms−1.

357.965–0.164 and 357.967–0.163. This is a pair of
two distinct methanol maser sites with a small separation
(7 arcseconds). We used the near kinematic distances of
3.9 and 2.2 kpc respectively (they are the same within
errors) rather than the HI self-absorption distance from
Green & McClure-Griﬃths (2011) of 15.2 kpc. We have cho-
sen the near distances as 357.965–0.164 is also associated
with a rare 23.4-GHz class I methanol maser and very
strong 9.9-GHz class I methanol maser whose ﬂux den-

sity is more than an order of magnitude stronger than
in other known sources (Voronkov et al. 2011) and the
Green & McClure-Griﬃths (2011) distance was identiﬁed as
unreliable in their paper. The systemic velocity of the region
is ∼ –3.0 kms−1 as that is the median velocity of the 6.7-
GHz methanol maser emission for both sources. 357.967–
0.163 has the stronger methanol maser emission and is also
accompanied by a 12.2-GHz methanol maser and an OH
maser (Breen et al. 2012; Caswell et al. 2013). It’s water
maser emission is continuous over 177 kms−1. In our ob-
servations it had a velocity range of –74.2 to 103.1 kms−1
with a peak velocity of 0.6 kms−1 and a peak ﬂux den-
sity of 57.8 Jy. Breen et al. (2010a) observed this source in
2003 and found it to have continuous emission over –80 to
+100 kms−1 with a peak velocity of 0 kms−1 and a peak

Table 2. 6.7-GHz methanol masers with no associated water maser emission. Column 1 is the name of the target methanol maser given
in Galactic coordinates; column 2 is the 5 sigma detection limit; column 3 is the epoch of observation coded 1, 2, 3 and 4 for 2011 June 3,
2011 June 4, 2011 June 5 and 2011 August 8 respectively. Column 4 gives associations with water masers detected in Pillai et al. (2006b)
or the Breen et al. (2010a) 2003 or 2004 observations but not in ours are indicated with a ‘w’, associations with the 1665 MHz transition
of OH masers (Caswell, 1998; Caswell et al. 2013) are indicated with an ‘o’ and sources marked with a ’*’ are within the survey region
for OH by Caswell (1998) and no emission was detected. Column 5 is the distance to the methanol maser. Distances estimates are from
Green et al. (2011) where available, others are the near kinematic distance (these are in italics) and the remainder are from Mark Reid
(private communication) (these are in square brackets).

ﬂux density of 40 Jy and in 2004 a velocity range of –81 to
+87 kms−1, peak velocity of –65 kms−1 and peak ﬂux den-
sity 57 Jy. 357.965–0.164 is the weaker 6.7-GHz methanol
maser of the two with the smaller velocity range with most of
its emission around the systemic velocity (–6.0 to 0.0 kms−1)
and no OH counterpart. It’s water maser is also the weaker
of the two and has a velocity range of –61.1 to 37.3 kms−1,
but most of the strong emission is within a couple of kms−1
of the peak (–5.2 kms−1), close to the systemic velocity of
the region. The higher velocity features are very weak in
comparison (< 0.5 Jy).

359.615–0.243. A strong methanol maser identiﬁed to
be variable by Caswell et al. (1995) and monitored by
Goedhart et al. (2004), and no periodicities in the variabil-
ity were observed. The associated water maser emission is
also quite variable, in 2003 it had a peak ﬂux density of
7 Jy, in 2004 14 Jy (Breen et al. 2010a) and in our 2011
observations 80.2 Jy.

0.546–0.852. The water maser has velocity range of
218.7 kms−1. Water maser emission was previously detected
by Forster & Caswell (1999) who found the velocities of the
maser site to range from –12.95 to 56.90 kms−1, these were
some of the features in the middle of the total velocity range
we observed in our observations (see Figure A1). Breen et al.
(2010a) found an even greater velocity range of –60 to
110 kms−1 in 2003, and in our observations we found weaker
high-velocity features out to –95.0 and +123.7 kms−1.

5.885–0.393. This source has been studied extensively in
water, OH and methanol and the latest water information
from Motogi et al. (2011) gives an astrometric distance of
1.28+0.09
−0.08 kpc, and conﬁrms the very large angular extent
of more than 4 arcseconds, which is not surprising at this
quite low distance. Some of the Motogi et al. (2011) water
features are within 2 arcseconds of MMB methanol maser, so
even though we ﬁnd the angular oﬀset to be > 3 arcseconds
we can establish that this water maser emission is associated
with the target methanol maser.

4 DISCUSSION

Titmarsh et al. (2014) found ∼ 46 per cent of the 6.7-GHz
methanol masers had associated water maser emission. This
is consistent within uncertainties with this sample where we
found approximately 50 per cent. To estimate the uncer-
tainty in our number of detections, we have used √Ndet,
where Ndet is the number of detections, however, this as-
sumes that the non-detections are due to purely stochas-
tic eﬀects. We know that source evolution and variabil-
ity play a major role in the detection statistics, however,
neither of these are well enough understood at present to
be able to account for them explicitly. Our results are
also consistent with previous searches for water masers
by Beuther et al. (2002); Szymczak et al. (2005); Xu et al.
(2008); Breen et al. (2010a).

The previous searches most similar to this study are
those by Szymczak et al. (2005) and Breen et al. (2010a).
Szymczak et al. (2005) searched a statistically complete, but
ﬂux-limited (peak intensity greater than 1.6 Jy), sample of
methanol masers with the Eﬀelsberg 100 m telescope for wa-
ter masers. They found 41 out of 79 methanol masers had
associated water masers (a 52 per cent detection rate, rms

noise of 0.45 Jy). Our detection rate is consistent within
the combined uncertainties, although our sample has sig-
niﬁcantly higher sensitivity (both in target methanol maser
sample and water maser observations) and higher angular
resolution.

Breen et al. (2010a) searched a large sample of OH and
6.7-GHz methanol maser targets with the ATCA for water
masers (5-σ detection limit in a 1 km s−1 channel typically
less than 0.2 Jy) in 2003 and 2004. 198 of their 270 methanol
masers had an associated water maser in this two epoch
search; a detection rate of 73 per cent. The main diﬀerence
between our sample of methanol masers and the Breen et al.
(2010a) sample, is that our sample is statistically complete.
The Breen et al. (2010a) methanol masers were primarily
those with associated OH masers or those without an OH
maser which had an accurate position from Caswell (2009),
which was biased towards sources with a higher 6.7-GHz
peak ﬂux density.

Another major survey of water masers is the H2O
Southern Galactic Plane Survey (HOPS) which conducted
an unbiased search for water masers in Galactic longitudes
290◦ through zero to 30◦ and latitudes of ±0.5◦ (Walsh et al.
2011, 2014). In the overlapping region between our survey
and the HOPS survey, there are 172 MMB masers. Of those,
Walsh et al. (2014) detected 57 to be associated with water
maser emission (∼ 33 per cent). This is much lower than our
survey, and is due the signiﬁcantly lower sensitivity of the
initial HOPS search which has an rms noise of 1 - 2 Jy over
most of the survey region and hence is likely to have de-
tected the majority of sources with peak ﬂux density above
10 Jy compared to our survey which will have detected most
of the sources above ∼0.25 Jy.
Considering only the sources in our survey above 10 Jy
we ﬁnd a detection rate of ∼ 25 per cent. In addition,
Walsh et al. (2014) used a less strict oﬀset criterion in as-
sessing whether 6.7-GHz methanol and water masers were
associated with the methanol and water masers being sepa-
rated by no more than 0◦.001 in Galactic coordinates which
is equivalent to an angular separation of ∼ 5.1 arcseconds.
From inspection of Figure 1, it can be seen this would yield
only a few more masers than using our 3 arcsecond criterion,
but enough that if we extend our association radius for our
masers above 10 Jy to 5.1 arcseconds we have a detection
rate consistent with that of HOPS.

In future large surveys of maser associations, it may be
desirable to determine maser associations based on a linear
separation criteria now that better distance estimates are
becoming available. However, we caution this only measures
the component of the linear separation in the plane of the
sky. Also, some sources have outﬂows and outﬂow sizes have
dependencies on age, environment and the luminosity of the
driving source, so there may not be a well deﬁned linear
scale for the water masers either.

4.1 Luminosities

There is evidence that the luminosities of 6.7-GHz methanol
masers increase as they evolve (Breen et al. 2010a, 2011).
Hence, we compared the luminosities of the methanol masers
with and without associated water masers to see if there was
any evidence for these being at diﬀerent evolutionary phases.
Previous work by Szymczak et al. (2005) using a statisti-

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

cally complete, but smaller sample (79 methanol masers)
with a greater detection-limit (peak intensity greater than
1.6 Jy) found no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
the methanol maser luminosities of those with and without
associated water masers.

Titmarsh et al. (2014) undertook the same comparison
with the MMB masers in the range l = 6◦ − 20◦. We found
a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the luminosities af-
ter the removal of the outlying, extremely luminous source
09.621+0.196 (luminosity ∼ 60000 Jy kms−1 kpc2). The dif-
ference became statistically signiﬁcant because of the large
reduction in variance in the population that have associated
water masers.

In this sample, however, we found no statistically sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerences in the methanol maser integrated lumi-
nosities between those with and without associated water
masers. The mean of the methanol luminosities with an as-
sociated water maser was higher than that of methanol only
sources as this was eﬀected by the extremely luminous source
345.505+0.348 (85500 Jy kms−1 kpc2), but the median lu-
minosity was lower. With the exception of this extremely lu-
minous methanol maser, the two distributions of integrated
luminosities are very similar.

We previously found that there was a correlation be-
tween the water maser peak and integrated luminosities and
those of their associated methanol masers (Titmarsh et al.
2014). Using the masers in this paper, we obtain a similar
result. Figure 3 shows water versus methanol peak and in-
tegrated luminosities respectively with linear least squares
ﬁts plotted. The peak luminosities have a Pearson’s corre-
lation coeﬃcient of R = 0.68 and the ﬁt has a slope of
0.65 (p-value of 5.8e-15). The integrated luminosities have a
Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient of R = 0.64 and the ﬁt has
a slope of 0.64 (p-value of 4.94e-13).

These correlations may be reduced in any individ-
ual source as maser beaming means that the emission is
not isotropic and the methanol and water masers may be
beamed in diﬀerent directions. However, over the whole sam-
ple this eﬀect should average out. Also, we have used the
emission integrated over the whole velocity range of the
masers, rather than the peak, and this should average out
the eﬀects of beaming in an individual source.

We ﬁnd the methanol and water maser luminosities are
both correlated with distance, so we expect there to be a
partial correlation between the maser luminosities due to
this alone. Uncertainties in distance estimates for the masers
don’t vary signiﬁcantly across the sample, with the excep-
tion of sources at LSR velocities near 0 kms−1 which are
at longitudes close to the Galactic Centre. Furthermore, we
do not have any evidence to suggest that there are system-
atic diﬀerences in the intrinsic luminosity of star formation
masers in diﬀerent regions of the Milky Way. However, ﬂux
density limited searches (such as the MMB and this survey)
tend to produce correlations between distance and luminos-
ity, since the less luminous sources are only detected nearby,
whereas the more luminous sources can be detected over a
greater volume. This is believed to be the reason for the par-
tial correlation we ﬁnd between maser luminosity and dis-
tance. We have used the procedure in Darling & Giovanelli
(2002) to account for this. We found the correlation coef-
ﬁcients between the water and methanol maser peak and
integrated luminosities and with distance (see Table 3) and

calculated the partial correlation coeﬃcients using Equation
1. Accounting for the partial correlation, we ﬁnd the maser
luminosities to still be loosely correlated. The water ver-
sus methanol maser peak and integrated luminosities have
partial correlation coeﬃcients of 0.44 and 0.43 respectively.
Following the approach in Wall & Jenkins (2003) we calcu-
late the standard error in the partial correlation coeﬃcients
for a sample size of 100 and 3 degrees of freedom to be 0.082.
Applying a t-test to the partial correlation coeﬃcient we ﬁnd
that for our sample they are signiﬁcant at the 99.9 per cent
conﬁdence level.

Since there is evidence that 6.7-GHz methanol masers
increase in luminosity as they age this may indicate that
there is a trend for water masers to increase in luminosity
as they age, although this may be over a long time scale
as water masers are well known for their variability. This is
consistent with Breen & Ellingsen (2011) who found, based
on the 1.2-mm data from dust clumps associated with water
masers, some evidence that water masers increase in lumi-
nosity as they evolve.

We also ﬁtted a general linear model to the methanol
maser luminosity, with the distance and water maser lumi-
nosity as the independent variables (we used the logarithms
of each of these quantities in the modelling). This modelling
showed that while there is a signiﬁcant dependence of the
methanol maser luminosity on distance, after taking that
into account a signiﬁcant dependence on the water maser
luminosity is still present. This is consistent with the value
calculated for the corrected Pearsons correlation coeﬃcient
which considers the partial correlation.

4.2 Velocities

6.7-GHz methanol masers are useful probes of the velocities
of the high-mass star formations they reside in. They typi-
cally have narrow total velocity ranges (less than 16 km s−1;
Caswell 2009) and central velocities within ± 3 km s−1 of
the systemic velocity of the region (Szymczak et al. 2007;
Caswell 2009; Pandian et al. 2009).

Water masers on the other hand, are well known for
their large total velocity ranges with highly red or blue-
shifted spectral features commonly found. Within high-mass
star formation regions, 10.472+0.027 is the most extreme,
with features redshifted up to 250 km s−1 from the systemic
velocity of the region and a total velocity range of nearly
300 km s−1 (Titmarsh et al. 2013).

data.

Figure 4 compares the velocity of the peak emis-
sion in the water and methanol masers. Consistent with
Titmarsh et al. (2014) we found that most (∼ 88 per cent) of
the water maser peak velocities lie within ± 10 km s−1 of the
peak velocity of the methanol masers. We note that in both
Titmarsh et al. (2014) and this paper we found our peak ve-
locities to be much more tightly correlated than Breen et al.
(2010a) who found 78 per cent of the water and methanol
maser peak velocities to be within ± 10 km s−1 of each
other. This may be because their sample was biased towards
sources with OH masers which have been shown to be more
evolved (Breen et al. 2010b).

We do however, ﬁnd our velocity ranges to be similar
to those of Szymczak et al. (2005) and Caswell et al. (2010).
Szymczak et al. (2005) found 33 per cent of their water
masers to have velocity ranges greater than 20 km s−1 (we
found 44 per cent) and 22 per cent greater than 40 km s−1
(we found 24 per cent). In the Caswell et al. (2010) sam-
ple of 32 masers from an unbiased survey for water masers,
they found 34 per cent of water masers with both methanol
and OH masers associated and 31 per cent of those with
just methanol, had emission red or blue-shifted more than
30 km s−1 from the systemic velocity. For the current sample
we ﬁnd 26 per cent meet these criteria.

sample.

in this

In Figure 5 we show the total velocity ranges that
the water maser emission spans
In
Titmarsh et al. (2014), where we performed the same sur-
vey over Galactic longitudes l = 6◦ − 20◦, we found the me-
dian velocity range to be ∼ 17 km s−1 and the mean to be
27 km s−1, consistent with this sample where we ﬁnd the me-
dian and mean total velocity ranges to be ∼ 17 km s−1 and
32 km s−1 respectively. In contrast to Titmarsh et al. (2014),
where only ∼ 7 per cent of our of the masers had velocity
ranges greater than 50 km s−1, this sample (l = 341◦ − 6◦
through zero) has ∼ 20 per cent with velocity ranges greater
than 50 km s−1. We can rule out being unable to detect
high velocity emission in the ﬁrst paper as we detected
10.472+0.027 which has a total velocity range of nearly
300 km s−1 (the largest velocity range in this paper is 0.546–
0.852 with a velocity range of 218.7 kms−1). In Figure 6
we investigate the total velocity ranges versus Galactic lon-
gitude. The three sources with the largest velocity ranges
(357.967–0.163, 359.138+0.031 and 0.546–0.852) are all close
to the Galactic Centre, but otherwise the masers with ve-
locity ranges greater than 50 km s−1 are spread across the
longitudes surveyed.

4.3 Variability

Water masers are well known for showing variations in their
spectra. Studying variability over long timescales is very
time consuming, hence variability studies over many epochs
tend to be with smaller sample sizes (Brand et al. 2003;
Felli et al. 2007).

For comparison with our sample, we have focused on
larger surveys. Two such surveys are Breen et al. (2010a)
and Walsh et al. (2011, 2014) which have observed the same
water maser sites at more than one epoch. In the Breen et al.
(2010a) survey, they observed 253 waters in 2003 and 2004
and 17 per cent of these were only detected in one epoch.
These masers typically had simpler spectra with only a few
velocity features and two-thirds had peak ﬂux densities of
less than 2 Jy when they were detected.

Walsh et al. (2011) detected 540 water masers between
2008 - 2010 in an unbiased search for water masers in the
Galactic Plane with the Mopra telescope. In 2011/2012 they
followed up these detections with high resolution observa-
tions from the ATCA (Walsh et al. 2014). 31 sites of water

maser emission were not detectable in the second epoch,
and like Breen et al. (2010a), they found the most variable
sources tended to be weaker with simpler spectra. Unlike
Breen et al. (2010a) they found a smaller fraction of the
masers not detected in one epoch (∼ 6 per cent). This is
likely to be because the Breen et al. (2010a) survey was
much more sensitive than the initial HOPS search (which
is estimated to be 98 per cent complete down to 8.4 Jy)
since there is a well established tendency for less luminous
water masers to exhibit greater fractional variability.

We have compared the properties of the water masers

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

The Spitzer Galactic Legacy Infrared Midplane Survey Ex-
traordinaire (GLIMPSE; Benjamin et al. 2003) surveyed the
Galactic Plane in four infrared bands: 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and
8.0 µm. Ellingsen (2006) used point sources identiﬁed by
GLIMPSE to compare the colours of the mid-infrared ob-
jects associated with 6.7-GHz methanol masers compared
to the general population of point sources. They used 56
methanol masers, most of which came from a blind sin-
gle dish survey for methanol masers in l = 325◦ − 335◦
(Ellingsen et al. 1996). They found that the mid-IR point
sources associated with masers tended to exhibit redder
colours than sources without masers, which is consistent
with them coming from high-mass star formation regions
with similar SED properties to Class 0 low-mass stars.

in the current sample that overlap with the Breen et al.
(2010a) and Walsh et al. (2014) observations. All of the
masers for which we have data at more than one epoch
showed some variations in their spectra. Figure 7 plots
(on a log-log scale) the peak ﬂux densities of our water
maser observations in 2011 against those in 2003/2004 from
Breen et al. (2010a) and against the 2011/2012 observations
from Walsh et al. (2014). There are a handful of masers that
have the same peak ﬂux densities (within uncertainties) in
two epochs, however, most show variation, some of which
may be from diﬀerent spectral features changing their rela-
tive intensities resulting in the peak ﬂux density being mea-
sured from a diﬀerent feature. Even though the masers in
Breen et al. (2010a) were observed 7 - 8 years apart from
our observations, they showed no more scatter in Figure 7
than the HOPS masers that were observed within 12 months
of ours.

Figure 7. The ﬁrst panel compares the peak ﬂux densities of the water masers that were observed in both the MMB follow-up (observed
in 2011) and the Breen et al. (2010a) sample. The Breen et al. (2010a) observations that were made in 2003 are marked with open circles
and those from 2004 are stars. The second panel shows peak ﬂux densities of water masers detected in the MMB follow-up and the HOPS
high resolution follow-up (observed in 2011 and 2012). There were many sources detected in our observations that were not reported in
HOPS. We have not included these as we do not know if they were not found because the initial HOPS search was much less sensitive
than ours, or because of variability. In both panels, where masers were detected in one epoch and not the other, 3 σ upper limits on the
ﬂux densities are shown with arrows. Also plotted are dotted lines with slope of 1.

between the infrared sources associated with both methanol
and water masers and those with only methanol.

Breen et al. (2010b) compared the GLIMPSE point
source colours of a sample of 113 6.7-GHz methanol masers
with and without associated 12.2-GHz methanol masers.
They found no diﬀerence in the colours of the two groups
and they proposed that the masers themselves are more sen-
sitive than the mid-infrared data to evolutionary changes in
the YSO.

Similar work by Gallaway et al. (2013) studied the mid-
infrared colours of the mid-IR sources hosting the MMB
masers. Since many of the mid-IR sources associated with
methanol masers were more extended than the GLIMPSE
point spread function, they used Adaptive Non-Circluar
Aperture Photometry (ANCAP) to measure their extended
ﬂux densities in all four GLIMPSE bands. Not all of the
maser counterparts were included, as some of the masers
did not have interferometric positions yet, were outside the
GLIMPSE survey range, GLIMPSE ﬂuxes were not avail-
able in all four bands, or there was more than one possible
counterpart. They found the infrared colours of the maser-
associated sources to be very similar to those of Ellingsen
(2006).

We used the Gallaway et al. (2013) ANCAP ﬂux densi-
ties to compare the MMB sources with and without associ-
ated water masers in colour-colour and colour-magnitude di-
agrams. Any diﬀerence in the infrared colours could point to
diﬀerences in evolutionary phase (like those with and with-
out OH masers in Ellingsen (2006)). However, we found no

4.5 Associations with 870-µm emission from dust

clumps

The earliest stages of high-mass star formation occur embed-
ded within clumps of gas and dust. These clumps are well
traced by their continuum dust emission which is optically
thin at submillimetre wavelengths allowing us to calculate
their clump masses and column densities (the column den-
sity is the molecular hydrogen column inferred from the ob-
served dust emission, an assumed dust-to-gas ratio of 1:100
and assuming that the dust emission is optically thin). The
APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the GALaxy (AT-
LASGAL; Schuller et al. 2009) is an unbiased survey of the
Galactic Plane at 870 µm with the APEX telescope in Chile.
ATLASGAL had a spatial resolution of 19.2 arcseconds and
a 5 σ sensitivity of 0.25 Jy beam−1.

About 95 per cent of the MMB masers lie within the re-
gion surveyed by ATLASGAL. Urquhart et al. (2013) used
the ATLASGAL source catalogues of Contreras et al. (2013)
and Csengeri et al. (2014) to match the methanol masers
with an associated dust clump. They used a criteria of be-
ing within 120 arcseconds of a peak in the 870 µm emission
to deﬁne an association as this was the largest clump radius
(Contreras et al. 2013). If more than one clump was within
that radius, they chose the clump with its peak emission
closest. They then inspected the ATLASGAL images to de-

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

termine if associations were genuine. ∼ 94 per cent of MMB
masers within the ATLASGAL survey range were found to
have an associated 870-µm dust clump.

We used the ATLASGAL-MMB associations identiﬁed
in Urquhart et al. (2013) to compare the dust emission of
the 6.7-GHz methanol masers with and without associated
water masers and also to compare the 870-µm emission with
the results from Titmarsh et al. (2014) using the 1.1 mm
emission from the Galactic Plane is the Bolocam Galactic
Plane Survey (BGPS; Rosolowsky et al. 2010). The BGPS
is another unbiased submillimeter survey of the Galactic
Plane which used the Bolocam instrument on the Caltech
Submillimeter Observatory to make a continuum survey of
the Galactic Plane at 1.1 mm with an eﬀective resolution
of 33 arcseconds. Like ATLASGAL, the BGPS is ideal for
tracing cold, dense gas and dust cores.

Chen et al. (2012) used dust clumps from the BGPS for
targeted class I methanol maser observations. When they
compared the properties of the clumps with and without as-
sociated masers, they found BGPS sources with an associ-
ated class I methanol maser had higher BGPS ﬂux densities
and beam averaged column densities than those without.
They also found a correlation between the intensity of the
class I methanol masers and the beam averaged column den-
sity.

In Titmarsh et al. (2014) we found BGPS sources with
an associated MMB maser to have higher integrated ﬂux
densities and higher column densities than the general pop-
ulation. However, we found no diﬀerences in these properties
between the clumps associated with an MMB maser with
and without a water maser present. Like class I methanol
masers, water masers are also pumped by collisions, and like
Chen et al. (2012) we found a weak correlation between the
water maser integrated ﬂux density and the beam averaged
column density.

To make our ATLASGAL comparisons, we recalculated
the masses and column densities of the dust clumps, as we
have distance estimates for all the MMB sources in our
survey (Urquhart et al. (2013) did not have distances for
many of the sources around the Galactic Centre) and we
used µ = 2.3 for the mean molecular weight of the ISM to
be consistent with Chen et al. (2012). Column densities and
clump masses were calculated according to equations 1 and
2 in Chen et al. (2012).

Unlike comparisons with the BGPS in Titmarsh et al.
(2014), we found no correlation between the integrated ﬂux
density of the water masers and the ATLASGAL column
densities of their associated dust clumps. The correlation at
1.1 mm was weak, however, we expected to observe similar
results at 870 µm as sources with higher integrated column
densities tend to be more massive and there may be a larger
volume of gas where the conditions are appropriate for maser
emission in these clumps. Similar to our comparisons with
the BGPS we also found no correlations between the water
maser luminosities and the clump masses or between the
methanol maser intensities and the column densities and
masses. We also found no diﬀerences in the distributions of
the ATLASGAL column densities and masses of the clumps
with both methanol and water masers and those with only
methanol.

Figure 8 shows the column densities of the clumps with
an associated MMB maser compared to those of all the AT-

LASGAL clumps within our survey region. The left panel
shows the distribution of the clumps with associated masers
zoomed in compared to all the clumps within our survey re-
gion, and the right panel shows that the fraction of maser-
associated dust clumps increases with increasing column
density. At the very highest column densities, almost 100 per
cent of clumps have an associated methanol maser. Like our
comparisons with the BGPS, the maser associated clumps
are skewed toward the higher mass clumps, unlike our BGPS
comparisons, the dust clumps with an associated maser ap-
pear to cover the whole range of column densities of the
general population. However, this may be a sensitivity issue
as the 5 σ sensitivity of ATLASGAL is 0.25 Jy beam−1, cor-
responding to a hydrogen column density of order 1022 cm−2
(Schuller et al. 2010) whereas the BGPS was sensitive to col-
umn densities greater than 1021 cm−2.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have observed all the known 6.7-GHz methanol masers in
the Galactic Plane between l = 341◦ and l = 6◦ (through the
Galactic centre) with the ATCA for water maser emission.
We detected water masers towards 101 out of the 204 sources
in this range (∼ 50 per cent) consistent with previous studies
within their ﬂux density and angular resolution constraints.
In Titmarsh et al. (2014) we concluded that there may
be a diﬀerence in the integrated luminosities between 6.7-
GHz methanol masers with and without associated wa-
ter masers, however, the current sample does not support
this (which is consistent with Szymczak et al. (2005)). Like
Titmarsh et al. (2014) we did ﬁnd a correlation between the
methanol and water peak and integrated luminosities, even
after taking into account the partial correlation due to dis-
tance. Since methanol masers increase in brightness as they
age, we interpret this to be evidence that water maser gen-
erally increase in brightness as they age.

Most of the peak velocities of the methanol and water
masers are well correlated (∼ 88 per cent within ± 10 km s−1
of each other), consistent with the previous paper in this
series. However, in the longitude range of this paper (l =
341◦ through the Galactic centre to l = 6◦) there are many
more sources with high total velocity ranges compared to the
previous paper (l = 6◦ − 20◦). In our current sample we had
∼ 20 per cent with velocity ranges greater than 50 km s−1
compared to the previous paper where it was ∼ 7 per cent.
The total velocity ranges in our current sample are similar
to those found in Szymczak et al. (2005) and Caswell et al.
(2010).

Using the GLIMPSE sources and their ﬂux densities in
the four Spitzer bands extracted by Gallaway et al. (2013),
we found no diﬀerence in the colours of the mid-infrared
sources associated with both methanol and water masers
and those with methanol only.

We used the ATLASGAL sources identiﬁed to have as-
sociated MMB masers in Urquhart et al. (2013), and found
that in the submillimetre emission there were no diﬀerences
between the column densities and masses of clumps with
both water and methanol masers associated and those with
just methanol. We did ﬁnd that the clumps associated with
methanol masers are skewed towards the higher column den-
sities compared to the general population. This is consistent

with our ﬁndings for 1.1-mm thermal dust continuum emis-
sion in Titmarsh et al. (2014).

Our ﬁndings support the conclusions of Breen et al.
(2014) that unlike 6.7-GHz methanol masers, there is little
evidence that water masers trace a well deﬁned evolutionary
stage of high-mass star formation. Nevertheless, water maser
observations can still provide us with valuable information
the physical conditions of the YSO.
