ABSTRACT
We use Local Group galaxy counts together with the ELVIS N-body simulations to
jointly constrain the scatter and slope in the stellar mass vs. halo mass relation at low
masses, M(cid:63) (cid:39) 105 − 108M(cid:12). Assuming log-normal scatter about a median relation of
the form M(cid:63) ∝ M α
halo, the preferred log-slope steepens from α (cid:39) 1.8 in the limit of
zero scatter to α (cid:39) 2.6 in the case of 2 dex of scatter in M(cid:63) at ﬁxed halo mass. We
provide ﬁtting functions for the best-ﬁt relations as a function of scatter, including
cases where the relation becomes increasingly stochastic with decreasing mass. We
show that if the scatter at ﬁxed halo mass is large enough ((cid:38) 1 dex) and if the median
relation is steep enough (α (cid:38) 2), then the “too-big-to-fail” problem seen in the Local
Group can be self-consistently eliminated in about ∼ 5 − 10% of realizations. This
scenario requires that the most massive subhalos host unobservable ultra-faint dwarfs
fairly often; we discuss potentially observable signatures of these systems. Finally, we
compare our derived constraints to recent high-resolution simulations of dwarf galaxy
formation in the literature. Though simulation-to-simulation scatter in M(cid:63) at ﬁxed
Mhalo is large among separate authors (∼ 2 dex), individual codes produce relations
with much less scatter and usually give relations that would over-produce local galaxy
counts.

1 INTRODUCTION

The standard paradigm of galaxy formation posits that dark
matter halos are the sites of galaxy formation (White & Rees
1978; Blumenthal et al. 1984). The underlying relationship
between galaxies and dark matter halos has emerged as an
important benchmark for detailed theories. In particular, re-
producing the observed abundance of galaxies as a function
of stellar mass or luminosity imposes a particularly powerful
constraint on models (Klypin et al. 1999; Benson et al. 2000;
Bullock et al. 2002; Berlind & Weinberg 2002; Kravtsov et al.
2004).

Perhaps the simplest example of this approach is to as-
sume that more massive dark matter halos host brighter
galaxies, such that the cumulative number density of dark
matter halos matches the cumulative number density of
galaxies in a nearly one-to-one fashion. On large scales and

for bright galaxies, this abundance matching (AM) assump-
tion, when applied using cosmological, DM-only simulations,
yields clustering statistics that agree remarkably well with
observations for ∼ L∗ galaxies with M(cid:63) (cid:39) 1010−11 (Conroy
et al. 2006; Reddick et al. 2013). Moreover, observational
estimates for halo masses, e.g. from X-ray temperatures or
virial-scale satellite kinematics, agree well with AM relations
up to the scale of giant cluster galaxies M(cid:63) (cid:39) 1012M(cid:12) (e.g.
Kravtsov et al. 2014). AM even appears to work well down
to M(cid:63) ∼ 109M(cid:12): when applied to the Millennium-II simula-
tion (Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2009), it correctly reproduces not
only the fraction of Milky Way (MW)-size hosts with LMC-
size satellites, but also the radial and velocity distributions
of those satellites (Tollerud et al. 2011). Perhaps most sur-
prisingly, galaxies over this range (M(cid:63) (cid:39) 109−12M(cid:12)) appear
to populate halos with a fairly small amount of scatter at
ﬁxed halo mass. Behroozi et al. (2013a), for example, report
a log-normal scatter (one standard deviation) of 0.2 dex in
M(cid:63) at ﬁxed Mhalo. Reddick et al. (2013) also prefer 0.2 dex

of scatter based on their clustering analysis. Kravtsov et al.
(2014) quote 0.1 dex for brightest cluster galaxies.

The focus of the present work is to explore the relation-
ship between halos and galaxies below the stellar mass range
that is easily accessible in large, volume-limited surveys:
M(cid:63) < 108M(cid:12). Simply extrapolating the slope of the rela-
tionship reported at higher masses would suggest that dwarf
halo, with α (cid:39) 1.6 − 1.9
galaxies obey a relation M(cid:63) ∝ M α
(Behroozi et al. 2013a; Moster et al. 2013). In fact, Garrison-
Kimmel et al. (2014a) found that this assumption with
α = 1.9 and minimal scatter does reproduce the abundance
of Local Group (LG) galaxies down to M(cid:63) (cid:39) 106M(cid:12) rea-
sonably well. In contrast, Brook et al. (2014) performed a
similar analysis and found a preferred log-slope of α = 3.1
over the tight mass range M(cid:63) (cid:39) 106−8M(cid:12). This is much
steeper than the relationship one expects from extrapolat-
ing the trend seen at higher masses. However, the log-slope
obtained by Brook et al. (2014) is degenerate with the nor-
malization at high masses (M(cid:63) ∼ 109.5M(cid:12)), which, due to
their method of matching simulated halo mass functions to
the observed stellar mass function, is sensitive to the masses
of the largest halos that form in their Local Group environ-
ments. In fact, Brook et al. (2014) predict very similar halo
masses to the Garrison-Kimmel et al. (2014a) relation for
M(cid:63) ∼ 106 − 107M(cid:12).

While AM (with minimal scatter) can reasonably re-
produce the counts of local galaxies, there are reasons to
consider the possibility that it breaks down entirely at very
low masses, or at least that the scatter increases dramati-
cally. One motivation comes from galaxy formation physics,
which suggests that star formation and gas retention in small
halos may be very sensitive to small changes in the halo’s
virial temperature and mass-accretion history reaching back
to the epoch of reionization (Bullock et al. 2000; Somerville
2002; Sawala et al. 2014). Another clue comes from direct
mass measurements in small galaxies themselves. The small-
est satellite galaxies of the MW demonstrate no observable
trend between central dynamical mass and luminosity (Stri-
gari et al. 2008), which may suggest that there is no trend
between total halo mass and stellar mass (or at least that the
relationship is very steep). A related result was presented by
Boylan-Kolchin et al. (2011, 2012), who compared the cen-
tral masses of dark mater subhalos in the ultra-high resolu-
tion Aquarius simulations of MW-size hosts (Springel et al.
2008) to the masses of the bright MW dwarf spheroidals
(dSphs). They found that the largest subhalos are denser
than any of the known MW dwarfs. One interpretation could
be that the most massive predicted subhalos have simply
failed to form enough stars for them to be observable, but
given the comparatively high mass of the oﬀending halos
(well above the mass where photoionization is expected to
act) we expect the missing halos to be “too big to fail”
(TBTF).

A wide variety of solutions for TBTF have been pro-
posed. For example, di Cintio et al. (2011), Wang et al.
(2012), Boylan-Kolchin et al. (2012), and Vera-Ciro et al.
(2013) pointed out that reducing the assumed mass of the
MW host halo to Mhalo ∼ 8 × 1011M(cid:12) will reduce the
number of problematic subhalos. It is also possible that
the substructure population of the MW is abnormal for its
mass (Purcell & Zentner 2012; Rodr´ıguez-Puebla et al. 2013;
Garrison-Kimmel et al. 2014b), though the fact that the

same problem appears to exist around M31 (Tollerud et al.
2014) makes such a solution less appealing. The detailed
analysis of Jiang & van den Bosch (2015) strongly suggests
that such a case would be exceedingly rare.

Others (e.g. Zolotov et al. 2012; Brooks et al. 2013; Ar-
raki et al. 2013; Del Popolo et al. 2014) have argued that
interactions with the baryons in the host galaxy, which are
not included in dark-matter only simulations, act to reduce
the central densities of the massive failures such that their
integrated masses within ∼ 1 kpc are similar to those of
the MW dSphs. These solutions, however, are only appli-
cable within the virial radius (Rv) of the MW, and break
down when faced with the ubiquity of TBTF not only in
the nearby ﬁeld (Garrison-Kimmel et al. 2014b), but also
well beyond the LG (Papastergis et al. 2015; Papastergis &
Shankar 2015).

Other authors have proposed explanations for TBTF
that do not rely on environmental inﬂuences, and which
could therefore act even in the ﬁeld. Gas blowouts, driven
by supernovae events within the dwarfs, may add energy
to dark matter particle orbits and reduce the central den-
sities enough to match observations (Mashchenko et al.
2008; Pontzen & Governato 2012; Governato et al. 2012;
Brooks & Zolotov 2014; Amorisco et al. 2013; Gritschneder
& Lin 2013). Though many authors (Pe˜narrubia et al. 2012;
Garrison-Kimmel et al. 2013; di Cintio et al. 2014) have ar-
gued that the galaxies of interest (M(cid:63) (cid:46) 106M(cid:12)) do not
produce enough supernovae to drive the required blowouts,
Maxwell et al. (2015) have made the point that energetic ar-
guments depend crucially on just how the dark matter par-
ticle orbits are perturbed. O˜norbe et al. (2015) presented a
single simulation of a M(cid:63) ∼ 2 × 106M(cid:12) galaxy that formed
within a TBTF halo with a central core density consis-
tent with those observed for similarly sized dwarfs. It is not
clear whether core formation of this kind should be common
enough to resolve the problem generally.

More recently, Papastergis & Shankar (2015) have used
HI data to show that the mass deﬁcit exists at radii well
beyond the stellar extent of the galaxy. This is particularly
hard to reconcile in models where stellar-feedback driven
core formation solves TBTF in energetically feasible ways
(di Cintio et al. 2014; O˜norbe et al. 2015; Maxwell et al.
2015; Chan et al. 2015). This is because the dark matter
cores produced by supernovae explosions in these cosmolog-
ical simulations are typically similar in size to the stellar
half-light radius of the galaxy. 1

Concerns about the ability of baryonic physics to re-
solve TBTF have motivated solutions that are cosmolog-
ical in nature. These include modiﬁcations to the small-
scale power spectrum (Polisensky & Ricotti 2014; Garrison-
Kimmel et al. 2014c) and altering the assumption that dark
matter is both cold (Anderhalden et al. 2013; Lovell et al.
2013; Horiuchi et al. 2016; Bozek et al. 2015) and collision-
less (Vogelsberger et al. 2012; Rocha et al. 2013; Zavala et al.
2013; Elbert et al. 2014).

1 Garrison-Kimmel et al. (2013) used simple numerical experi-
ments to explore models that removed dark matter mass well be-
yond the galaxy half-light radius, but showed that these cases re-
quire even more energy, likely exceeding the energy budget avail-
able from supernovae.

Organized Chaos: Scatter in the relation between stellar mass and halo mass in small galaxies

3

Most of the explanations detailed above alter the den-
sity proﬁles of massive (sub)halos such that they may host
the observed dwarfs. In principle, however, these massive
dwarf halos may remain cuspy and dense but form far fewer
stars than simple, low-scatter extrapolations of AM relations
suggest. In such a situation, a TBTF halo would not be “too
big to fail” after all, but actually remain undetectable to
current observations. In practice, therefore, TBTF may be
indicative of increased scatter in the M(cid:63)-Mhalo relation at
small masses. If so, this would indicate that galaxy forma-
tion proceeds in a fundamentally distinct way in dark mat-
ter halos smaller than Mhalo ∼ 1011M(cid:12), perhaps because
the baryons in those potential wells are far more susceptible
to both internal and external perturbations than previously
expected. Understanding the scatter in the M(cid:63)-Mhalo rela-
tion is thus crucial to our overall understanding of how stars
and galaxies form in dark matter halos.

In what follows, we use the ELVIS (Exploring the Local
Volume in Simulations) suite (Garrison-Kimmel et al. 2014a)
along with the stellar mass function (SMF) of galaxies in the
Local Group (LG) to constrain the M(cid:63)-Mhalo relation down
to the lowest stellar masses possible due to completeness
M(cid:63) (cid:39) 105M(cid:12). We normalize our relation at high masses
to the results of Behroozi et al. (2013a, hereafter B13) and
explore models with a variable faint-end log-slope α and
a log-normal scatter σ and explore the covariance between
them.
This paper is organized as follows: §2 discusses the
observational and theoretical data employed here, followed
by the methods for assigning stellar masses to (sub)halos
and quantifying the goodness of ﬁt to the M(cid:63) functions. §3
presents the best-ﬁt log-slope, and explores one impact of
varying the scatter by investigating the severity of TBTF,
quantiﬁed by the number of “bright” massive failures in each
realization. We close by discussing other observable conse-
quences of an increase in the low mass scatter in §4 and
brieﬂy summarize in §5.

2 METHODS

2.1 Observational Data

In order to maximize the observational sample size, we adopt
three independent completeness cuts for dwarfs that are ei-
ther 1) satellites of the Milky Way; 2) satellites of M31; or
3) non-satellite that exist within in the Local Group. We
include all eleven classical satellites of the MW, deﬁned as
those identiﬁed prior to SDSS within 300 kpc of the Galactic
center. The faintest of these, Draco, deﬁnes our incomplete-
ness limit of M(cid:63) = 4.5× 105M(cid:12). Completeness around M31
is perhaps better understood due to the uniformity of the
PAndAS survey – Figure 24 of Tollerud et al. (2012) illus-
trates that PAndAS is complete to galaxies with half-light
luminosities L1/2 > 105L(cid:12), for typical half-light radii. As-
suming a mass-to-light ratio of two, and including the total
stellar mass of the galaxy, we therefore adopt an incomplete-
ness limit of M(cid:63) = 105M(cid:12), but only include galaxies (and
subhalos) within the PAndAS footprint, the central 150 kpc
of the galaxy. In the “Local Field” (LF), deﬁned here as the
region more than 300 kpc from both the MW and M31, but
within 1.2 Mpc of either (a cut chosen to match the possible

lites (magenta), the M31 satellites within the PAndAS survey
volume (dM31 < 150 kpc, cyan), and galaxies in the Local Field
(green), which includes all galaxies more than 300 kpc from both
the MW and M31, but within 1.2 Mpc of either giant. Stellar
masses are from Woo et al. (2008), where available, and are oth-
erwise calculated from the luminosities tabulated in McConnachie
(2012), assuming a mass-to-light ratio of two. Each histogram is
truncated at the adopted completeness limit: M(cid:63) = M(cid:63), Draco =
4.5 × 105M(cid:12) for the MW satellites, M(cid:63) = 105M(cid:12) for satellites
around M31 (Tollerud et al. 2012), and M(cid:63) = 4.5× 106M(cid:12) in the
Local Field.

cuts in the simulations; see §2.2), we adopt an incomplete-
ness limit of M(cid:63) = M(cid:63), Cetus = 4.5 × 106M(cid:12). We acknowl-
edge, however, that incompleteness in the LF is poorly un-
derstood, and we therefore analyze the LF separately from
the satellite populations.

We exclude the two most massive satellites of both the
MW (the LMC and the SMC) and M31 (M33 and NGC 205)
from our analysis because such luminous satellites are known
to be rare around MW-size systems (Boylan-Kolchin et al.
2010; Busha et al. 2011; Tollerud et al. 2011), and many
of the ELVIS hosts lack the massive subhalos that appear
to host these systems (Tollerud et al. 2011); including these
systems, however, has only a slight eﬀect on the results. Ha-
los assigned stellar masses below the completeness limit are
not considered in calculating the goodness-of-ﬁt between the
observational SMFs and those derived from the simulations
(see §2.4). Many models therefore overproduce counts be-
low the cited completeness limits. If there are undiscovered
galaxies above the completeness limits, then we will under-
estimate the best-ﬁt log-slope.

The names, stellar masses, and adopted distances from
the centers of the MW and M31 are listed in Table 1; we
explicitly note that our distance cuts exclude M33 (Trian-
gulum), which lies outside the PAndAS footprint. The anti-
cumulative stellar mass functions are also plotted in Fig-
ure 1 for the MW (magenta), M31 (cyan), and in the LF

The sample includes the classical satellites of the MW, dwarfs
with M(cid:63) ≥ 105M(cid:12) within 150 kpc of M31, and galaxies brighter
than Cetus in the LF. Stellar masses are taken from Woo et al.
(2008) where available, and are otherwise drawn from the data
compiled in McConnachie (2012), assuming a mass-to-light ratio

are drawn from Woo et al. (2008) where possible, and are
otherwise calculated from the data in McConnachie (2012),
assuming M(cid:63)/L = 2. Similarly, the MW-centric distances
are taken from McConnachie (2012), and the M31-centric
distances are calculated from the positions given in that
work, assuming an MW-M31 separation of 787 kpc (Mc-
Connachie et al. 2005).

2.2 Simulations

Subhalo and ﬁeld halo mass functions are drawn from the
Exploring the Local Volume In Simulations (ELVIS) suite,
detailed in full in Garrison-Kimmel et al. (2014a). Brieﬂy,

ELVIS includes twelve LG-like MW/M31 pairs of hosts, se-
lected to be ∼ 800 kpc apart, moving towards one another,
and isolated from any larger systems. ELVIS additionally
includes twenty-four isolated hosts, mass-matched to the
systems in the pairs. All systems are free of contaminating
low-resolution (high mass) particles within their virial radii.
Moreover, the ﬁelds around the paired halos are uncontam-
inated within (cid:38) 1 Mpc of each halo center: only four pairs
contain low resolution particles within 1.2 Mpc of a host cen-
ter, and the low-resolution mass fraction within that volume
is (cid:28) 0.1% in each of those systems. We therefore deﬁne the
“Local Field” (LF) as the volume within 1.2 Mpc of either
host center, but more than 300 kpc from both hosts (as in
Garrison-Kimmel et al. 2014a).

The ELVIS suite was initialized using MUSIC (Hahn &
Abel 2011) and simulated using a combination of GADGET-2
and GADGET-3 (Springel 2005) assuming WMAP-7 cosmo-
logical parameters (Larson et al. 2011): Ωm = 0.266, ΩΛ =
0.734, ns = 0.963, σ8 = 0.801, and h = 0.71. All forty-eight
halos were simulated with high-resolution regions embed-
ded within boxes 70.4 Mpc on a side. The particle mass
mp within that high-resolution volume is 1.9 × 105M(cid:12); the
Plummer-equivalent force softening  is held ﬁxed in comov-
ing units for z > 9, after which  becomes 141 pc in physical
units.2

Following B13, we parameterize the M(cid:63)-Mhalo relation
in terms of Mpeak, the largest instantaneous virial mass as-
sociated with the main branch of each (sub)halo’s merger
tree. Particularly for subhalos, which have been signiﬁ-
cantly stripped via interactions with the MW/M31 host,
“peak” quantities appear to correlate more strongly with
M(cid:63) than the subhalo properties today (Reddick et al. 2013).
Peak quantities for the ELVIS halos are drawn from merger
trees created with rockstar (Behroozi et al. 2013b) and
consistent-trees (Behroozi et al. 2013c; for more details,
see Garrison-Kimmel et al. 2014a).

In order to create an analogous comparison set to the
observational data, we create satellite populations within
both 150 kpc and 300 kpc of each ELVIS halo center for
every combination of α and σ. The former (latter) popula-
tion is then compared to the M31 (MW) dataset. To ﬁnd
a ﬁnal goodness-of-ﬁt, each ELVIS pair is compared to the
paired observational dataset, where the better ﬁt matching
between the two halos and the MW/M31 is used in each
realization. Because the isolated ELVIS hosts have mass
functions that are indistinguishable from those of the paired

2 Three of the isolated halos were also simulated with eight times
more particles in the high-resolution regions (mp = 2.35×104M(cid:12),
 = 70.4 pc). Garrison-Kimmel et al. (2014a) used these simu-
lations to show that the ELVIS suite is complete to Mpeak =
6 × 107M(cid:12), which is well below the adopted observational com-
pleteness cut for the vast majority of the models that we explore
here: for α = 2, e.g., M(cid:63)(Mpeak = 6 × 107M(cid:12)) ∼ 102 M(cid:12).
However, numerical incompleteness in the halo catalog may inﬂu-
ence our results for large scatters and/or very shallow slopes. We
therefore calculate the best-ﬁt log-slopes, derived from comparing
realizations drawn from those three isolated halos to the stellar
mass function of the MW, both at the ﬁducial resolution and at
higher resolution. Averaged over 500 realizations, the best-ﬁt α
diﬀers by ∼ 6% at most, indicating that our results are indepen-
dent of numerical resolution.

hosts (Garrison-Kimmel et al. 2014a), we create “pairs” from
the isolated hosts to maximize our simulation sample; the
isolated halos, however, are excluded from the LF analy-
sis. Furthermore, the ﬁelds around three of the ELVIS pairs
(Siegfried & Roy, Serena & Venus, and Kek & Kauket) are
systematically oﬀset to much higher masses at ﬁxed num-
ber, compared to the remaining nine pairs. These systems
thus prefer extremely steep log-slopes (α (cid:38) 4) at all scatters
to avoid overproducing the LF SMF. We therefore eliminate
them from our LF analysis because they do not appear to
be representative of the ﬁeld around the MW.

of Garrison-Kimmel et al. 2014a), however, our method pri-
marily constrains the scatter below the masses probed by
B13.

Our second model, which we refer to as the “growing
scatter” model, is motived by recent simulation results that
suggest the level of stochasticity in galaxy formation may
increase at decreasing halo masses (e.g. Sawala et al. 2014).
Speciﬁcally, we model the log-normal scatter σ as a function
of the peak mass, such that σ = 0.2 for Mpeak > M1 but
grows linearly with decreasing log10 Mpeak for Mpeak ≤ M1:

2.3 Assigning stellar masses to halos

We explore monotonic relationships between M(cid:63) and Mpeak
with log-normal symmetric scatter σ in M(cid:63) at ﬁxed Mpeak.
The models match the results of B13 above the dwarf scale:
for Mpeak > M1 ∼ 1011.5M(cid:12) (roughly the mass at which
the low-mass slope begins to dominate), we directly adopt
the median relation in B13. We emphasize that the stellar
mass predicted at M1, M(cid:63) ∼ 5 × 109M(cid:12), roughly matches
the stellar mass of the LMC, ∼ 109M(cid:12). As noted above, the
population statistics of LMC-size galaxies are reproduced
well with minimal scatter in AM relations, but both simu-
lations and observations suggest that diﬀerent physical pro-
cesses may become important on smaller scales. We therefore
allow both the log-slope and the scatter to vary freely for
Mpeak < M1.

Speciﬁcally, B13 parameterizes M(cid:63)(Mhalo) as

log10 M(cid:63) = log10(M1) + f (log10(

Mhalo

)) − f (0)

where

f (x) = − log10(10

.

(2)

A full interpretation of the parameters, which vary with red-
shift, is given in Table 1 of B13; brieﬂy, M1 and  indicate
the characteristic halo mass and stellar mass to halo mass
ratio, respectively, while γ and δ govern the behavior at the
high mass end (Mhalo > M1). For our purposes, however, the
low mass end is most important, where Equation 1 behaves
as a power-law with log-slope α: M(cid:63) ∝ M α
halo. In the anal-
ysis that follows, we hold the parameters quoted in Section
5 of B13 ﬁxed for Mhalo > M1, but replace α with values
ranging freely from 0 to 4 for Mhalo < M1. For comparison,
B13 derive a faint-end log-slope α = 1.412 at z = 0, though
Garrison-Kimmel et al. (2014a) showed that α = 1.92 better
reproduces galaxy counts in the LG with the same normal-
ization, assuming zero scatter. Below, however, we demon-
strate explicitly that the best-ﬁt α varies monotonically with
the assumed scatter.
We primarily explore two models for including scatter
in the M(cid:63) − Mhalo relation. The ﬁrst, which we refer to as
“constant scatter,” assumes a symmetric, log-normal scatter
σ in M(cid:63) at ﬁxed Mpeak that is independent of Mpeak. This
model is based on the results of B13, who quote a constant
σ of 0.2 dex for M(cid:63) > 108.5M(cid:12). Rather than introducing
a discontinuity in the scatter at M(cid:63) = 108.5M(cid:12), we elect
to apply scatter uniformly at all Mpeak. Due to a lack of
galaxies in our observational sample with M(cid:63) (cid:38) 109M(cid:12) and
a lack of (sub)halos with Mpeak (cid:38) 1011M(cid:12) (Figures 3 and 5

MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2014)

σγ = 0.2 + γ(log10 Mpeak − log10 M1).

(3)

The parameter γ quantiﬁes the rate at which the scatter
grows: a more negative γ (larger magnitude) results in larger
scatter at ﬁxed Mpeak, whereas γ = 0 corresponds to a con-
stant scatter of 0.2 dex.

For both models, we create 500 realizations for each
satellite or ﬁeld system, resulting in 12,000 “paired” realiza-
tions of the satellite systems of the MW and M31 and 4500
realizations of the LF for every combination of α and σ.

Though we do not present the results here, we also ex-
plore a model with a sharp cut-oﬀ in star formation below
Mpeak = 109M(cid:12), as motivated by reionization arguments
(Bullock et al. 2000; Somerville 2002) and recent hydrody-
namic simulations (e.g. Sawala et al. 2014, but see Wheeler
et al. 2015). The results from such a model are nearly iden-
tical, however, as the galaxies included in our sample are
nearly always assigned to halos with Mpeak > 109M(cid:12). We
additionally explore models with one-sided scatter, including
both exponential and Rayleigh distributions; models with
ﬁxed σ = 0.2 dex above M1 ∼ 1011.5M(cid:12); and models with
M(cid:63) ﬁxed to be less than Mpeak × fb, the cosmic baryon frac-
tion. All of these yield very similar results to the two simple
models described above.

2.4 Quantifying the goodness of ﬁt

We now turn to the problem of quantifying the match be-
tween a theoretical realization for the stellar mass function
and the true observational SMF. Rather than performing a
likelihood-based analysis on the diﬀerential mass functions,
which is sensitive to the choice of bins due to the small num-
bers of objects, we elect to compare the mass functions in
an anti-cumulative sense. Speciﬁcally, for each realization,
we rank-order the galaxies by stellar mass and calculate

Figure 2. Left: Two sample relations between (sub)halo mass, quantiﬁed here by Mpeak, the largest mass a (sub)halo ever attains, and
galaxy stellar mass M(cid:63) at z = 0. Both relations are anchored to the Behroozi et al. (2013a) relation above Mpeak ∼ 1011.5. The magenta
line plots a relation that at the faint end asymptotes to M(cid:63) ∝ M α
halo with α = 1.8 (similar that advocated in Garrison-Kimmel et al.
2014a) and with no scatter. The cyan line shows an alternative, steeper relation relation, with α = 2.6, but with correspondingly larger
scatter σ = 2 dex. Right: In black, the anti-cumulative stellar mass function (SMF) of the MW and M31 satellites used in this work (see
§2.1), with Poissonian error bars. The magenta line plots the mean of the SMFs obtained from applying the magenta line in the right
plot to the ELVIS subhalo populations. Similarly, the solid cyan line plots the mean SMF obtained by assuming the cyan relation in the
right plot, including a log-normal scatter of 2 dex. The dotted cyan line, however, represents the mean SMF from the same relation, but
without applying any scatter. The break at M(cid:63) ∼ 105.5M(cid:12) is due to the completeness cut placed on the MW satellites. There is clearly
a degeneracy between the slope of the M(cid:63)-Mhalo relation and the assumed scatter, such that one must vary both to maintain a good ﬁt
to the local SMFs.

alization.3 The best-ﬁt log-slope for a given σ is therefore
that which minimizes κ.

In order to evaluate κ as a metric, we compare the ﬁdu-
cial stellar masses listed in Table 1 to Monte Carlo realiza-
tions of the data themselves created by sampling log-normal
distributions on their reported observational errors in the
stellar masses (where the errors are again drawn from the
data cataloged in McConnachie 2012). The values of κ cal-
culated this way vary between ∼ 0.05 dex and ∼ 0.2 dex,
peaking at ∼ 0.11 dex, for both the MW and M31 satellite
systems. The LF sample, by virtue of the high completeness
cut (and smaller errors on M(cid:63)), peaks at ∼ 0.06 dex. We con-
clude that theoretical realizations with κ ∼ 0.2 dex are very
similar to the observed stellar mass function, roughly con-
sistent with randomly sampling the data themselves within
observational errors.

Because κ takes into account only the N “brightest” ha-
los in a given realization, where N is the number of galax-
ies in the corresponding observational sample, it does not

3 We also explore alternative deﬁnitions of κ, including a ver-
sion without the absolute value (such that diﬀerences may cancel
out) and a root-mean-square method, which highlights the largest
discrepancies. Overall, we ﬁnd that the best-ﬁt slopes are nearly
identical between the deﬁnitions when averaging over the realiza-
tions of a simulated system, regardless of the speciﬁc deﬁnition
of κ.

constrain the shape of the stellar mass function below the
faintest galaxy in the observational sample. This fact is in-
consequential for the MW and LF samples, as the incom-
pleteness limit is deﬁned by M(cid:63) of the faintest galaxy, but
it is important for M31, where the incompleteness is bet-
ter understood. To therefore constrain the shape of the stel-
lar mass function between the incompleteness limit, 105M(cid:12),
and the faintest galaxy in the sample, ∼ 1.5 × 105M(cid:12), we
insert a galaxy with M(cid:63) = 105M(cid:12) into the catalog; that is,
we assume there is an undetected galaxy lurking just below
the completeness limit. Without this insertion, κ generally
prefers slightly steeper slopes, but the models predict ad-
ditional galaxies with M(cid:63) ∼ 105M(cid:12) within the PAndAS
footprint.

3 RESULTS

One of the qualitative aims of this paper is to accurately
explore the covariance between scatter and slope. The ba-
sic need for this is illustrated in Figure 2. The left panel
shows two example relations between stellar mass and halo
mass: one, in cyan, with a steep slope (M(cid:63) ∝ M α
halo with
α = 2.6) and large scatter (σ = 2 dex), and the other,
in magenta, with a ﬂatter slope (α = 1.8) and no scatter.
The right panel presents the resultant stellar mass functions
from averaging over realizations of the ELVIS halos, along
with those observed for the MW and M31 combined (see

Figure 3. The goodness of ﬁt, quantiﬁed by κ, of the subhalo mass functions to the MW and M31 stellar mass functions (left) and
similarly for halos and galaxies in the Local Field (right), as a function of the log-slope α of the M(cid:63)-Mpeak relation and of the log-normal
scatter σ about the median relation. Plotted are the averages over the systems, which are themselves averaged over 500 realizations
for each combination of σ and α. The while line, which is the same in both panels, indicates the best-ﬁt α derived from the satellite
distribution. For the left plot, we minimize κMW + κM31 for each realization; i.e., each host may be matched with either the MW or M31.
Plotted is (κMW + κM31)/2, which weights the two satellite systems equally and consequently weights the individual MW satellites more
heavily than the M31 satellites. As the assumed scatter increases, α must also increase such that the relation falls oﬀ more steeply for
Mpeak < M1 ∼ 1011.5M(cid:12). Otherwise, the scattering of small halos to high M(cid:63) results in an over-estimation of the SMF. For comparison,
we overplot the faint-end log-slopes quoted by B13 (black square), Garrison-Kimmel et al. (2014a, black diamond), and Moster et al.
(2013, circles). For satellite systems, which the Moster et al. (2013) formalism dictates should be assigned stars according to their infall
redshifts, we indicate the range of log-slopes quoted by Moster et al. (2013) for 0 < z < 3.

§2.1 and Table 1 for details). Both of these models produce
similar stellar mass functions (which are roughly consistent
with those observed in the Local Group) even though their
slopes are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. This is driven by the diﬀer-
ence in scatter. The dashed cyan line the right panel assumes
the same steep relation as the solid line, but this time with
zero scatter; this results in a satellite mass function that is
much below the data. This diﬀerence is due to the rapidly
rising halo mass function. In cases with a large amount of
scatter, small systems scattering to large stellar masses will
dominate over large systems scattering to low stellar masses.
Intuitively, therefore, large scatter requires a steeper slope
to avoid overproducing the observed stellar mass function.
In what follows we present a more rigorous analysis to

jointly constraint the scatter and slope.

3.1 Relation between log-slope and scatter

We begin by examining the best-ﬁt log-slope α at each as-
sumed scatter σ, both within the virialized volumes of the
host halos and in the ﬁelds surrounding them. Figure 3 shows
the ﬁt parameter κ as a function of slope α and scatter for
the satellites of the MW and M31 on the left and galax-
ies in the Local Field (LF) on the right. The results have
have been averaged over all simulations, including 500 re-
alizations of each simulation for each (α, σ) model repre-
sented on the grid. In the left panel, we choose the smaller of

MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2014)

(κMW, host 1 + κM31, host 2)/2 and (κMW, host 2 + κM31, host 1)/2
for each realization, intrinsically allowing the MW/M31 to
be matched with either the larger or smaller ELVIS host.4
The solid white line in Figure 3 indicates the average
best-ﬁt α for the satellite systems; i.e., it plots the minimum
κ in the left panel. The two regions yield qualitatively sim-
ilar results, though the LF prefers a slightly steeper slope
(indicated by the dashed grey line in the right panel of Fig-
ure 3) and marginally prefers a smaller σ, whereas the satel-
lite analysis yields an equally good ﬁt at all σ. In practice,
the two regions may be combined to yield a single α(σ) re-
lation, but we elect to consider them independently, both to
include the isolated “pairs” in the left panel, which do not
have analogous LF regions and therefore cannot be included
in the right plot, and because the incompleteness is more
poorly understood in the LF. The average best-ﬁt α is well
ﬁt by a quadratic function in both cases. Speciﬁcally, for the
satellites we ﬁnd α:

αsats ∼= 0.14σ2 + 0.14σ + 1.79

(5)

4 Only one “pair” strongly prefers to match the MW with the
larger host at all σ, whereas several prefer to match the MW with
the lower mass host. However, for σ (cid:38) 0.25, many systems have
roughly an equal probability to match the MW with each host.
Together, these conspire to keep the mean fraction of realizations
where the MW is matched with the larger host nearly constant
at ∼ 30%.

while the LF relation is best-ﬁt by

where σ is one standard deviation of the log10-normal scat-
ter.

The symbols overplotted in Figure 3 indicate the results
of B13 (black square), Garrison-Kimmel et al. (2014a, black
diamond), and Moster et al. (2013, circles). Because the lat-
ter relation is derived assuming that abundance matching is
performed at the redshift of a subhalo’s infall, we plot the
evolution of the slope for 0 < z < 3 in the left panel (dashed
black line), with speciﬁc redshifts highlighted. Though there
is a large spread in the infall redshifts of the ELVIS subha-
los, Wetzel et al. (2015) showed that most fell into a larger
host between 3 (cid:46) z (cid:46) 0.5. Nonetheless, the comparison to
the Moster et al. (2013) slopes is imperfect due to diﬀer-
ing normalizations; in practice, however, the Moster et al.
(2013) normalization at Mhalo = 1011M(cid:12) diﬀers from that
of B13 (and therefore our normalization) by less than 5% in
logspace.

Figure 4 similarly illustrates the results for a model
where the scatter grows with decreasing galaxy mass. As
in Figure 3, the vertical axis shows the log-slope of M(cid:63) −
Mpeak, but the horizontal axis here plots γ, the slope of
σ(log10 Mpeak) (see Equation 3). For reference, the upper
axis indicates the symmetric scatter at Mpeak = 1010M(cid:12),
highlighting the fact that the growing scatter model explores
larger scatters than the constant scatter case. The results,
however, are qualitatively identical: as the scatter grows, α
must also grow in order to avoid overproducing the observed
SMF. The best-ﬁt relation is here presented in terms of γ:

αγ,sats ∼= 0.25γ2 − 1.37γ + 1.69.

(7)

(8)

We do not plot the relation for the LF because it follows
a qualitatively identical trend to Figure 4 with a slight oﬀ-
set to steeper slopes, as expected through comparison with
Figure 3. Speciﬁcally, the best-ﬁt log-slope α from the ﬁeld
galaxies is given by

αγ,ﬁeld ∼= 0.47γ2 − 1.48γ + 1.81.

The diﬀerence in the preferred log-slopes between the
satellite systems and the LF is likely to be enhanced by tidal
eﬀects from a baryonic disk, which will systematically shift
the subhalo mass functions lower at ﬁxed counts. Assum-
ing that dark subhalos are destroyed at the same rate as
luminous satellites, this shift will allow an even shallower
M(cid:63) − Mhalo relation to ﬁt the satellite systems. The discrep-
ancy between the LF and the satellite systems is further
highlighted by extrapolating the the LF below the com-
pleteness limit: the best-ﬁt relation at σ = 0 dex predicts
an average of ∼ 40 LF galaxies with 105 < M(cid:63)/M(cid:12) < 106
(“classical” dwarfs), which decreases to ∼ 10 for σ = 2 dex.
If upcoming surveys do not identify a wealth of new nearby
ﬁeld galaxies, it may be indicative of a change in how galaxy
formation proceeds in small halos at late times, as satellites
of a given mass today are likely to have formed earlier than
ﬁeld halos at the same mass.

Averaged over the twenty-four MW-M31 pairs or the
nine LFs, the best-ﬁt α yields a ﬁt, quantiﬁed by κ, that
is 3 − 4 times worse than the Monte Carlo realizations of
the observational data with themselves. However, the single
best-ﬁt realization of each system, taken over all values of

α at ﬁxed σ, typically yield a ﬁt that is only ∼ 0.1 dex
worse than the data with themselves, even after averaging
over the systems. Moreover, merely selecting these best-ﬁt
realizations at each σ yields log-slopes identical to the ﬁts
given above.

3.2 Implications for the too-big-to-fail problem

Having quantiﬁed the best-ﬁt log-slope as a function of the
scatter, we move to investigating how the severity of TBTF
varies with σ. We quantify the problem by counting the
number of massive dark matter halos that are missing from
the known galaxy population. We call these missing mas-
sive systems “massive failures.” While Figure 3 indicates
the trends with α and σ averaged over the ELVIS systems,
in this section we will count massive failures for a given σ at
the best-ﬁt α of each system, averaging over the realizations
of that system. Within 300 kpc of the MW, we then count
massive failures in the host matched with the MW, again in
a realization-by-realization manner.

Our deﬁnition of massive failures is similar to that em-
ployed in Garrison-Kimmel et al. (2014b) in that we select
“candidate” (sub)halos to host the dwarf galaxies, then re-
quire that each dwarf be matched with only one (sub)halo.
A dwarf may only be matched with a (sub)halo if the 1σ
error on the implied circular velocity at the 3D half-light
radius, V1/2 at R1/2, is greater than the circular velocity
Vcirc of that sub(halo) at R1/2. As in Garrison-Kimmel et al.
(2014b), we calculate Vcirc proﬁles for halos from Vmax, the
maximum circular velocity of the halo, and Rmax, the ra-
dius at which Vmax occurs, assuming Einasto (1965) proﬁles
with a shape parameter of 0.18. Unlike Garrison-Kimmel
et al. (2014b), however, we select candidate halos based not
on their halo properties, but on the stellar masses that they
were assigned in a given realization, such that all halos above
the incompleteness limits (4.5×105M(cid:12) around the MW and
4.5× 106M(cid:12) in the LF) are eligible to be counted as massive
failures. All remaining (sub)halos, i.e. those with M(cid:63) above
the completeness limit that are not assigned a galaxy, are
considered massive failures. The average number of these
massive failures in each realization is plotted in Figure 5,
which we explain in greater detail below.

Our observational samples are comprised of the MW
satellites and LF dwarfs listed in Table 1. As in previous
TBTF analyses (e.g. Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2012; Garrison-
Kimmel et al. 2014b), however, we eliminate the LMC and
the SMC due both to their relative rarity and substantial
contribution from baryons within R1/2, and also exclude the
Sagittarius dSph as it is currently interacting with the disk
and is unlikely to be in kinematic equilibrium. For consis-
tency, we therefore also exclude the three brightest subhalos
in each realization, rather than simply excluding the three
most massive. We also exclude NGC 6822 from our count-
ing in the LF, as it is likewise baryon dominated within R1/2
(Kirby et al. 2014), and Sagittarius dIrr, as there have thus
far been no attempts to measure its internal kinematics. To
match these exclusions, we similarly remove the halo with
the highest M(cid:63) and the halo with the sixth highest M(cid:63) from
each realization for the LF.

Kinematic data (V1/2 and R1/2) for the remaining nine
MW satellites are drawn from Wolf et al. (2010), who used
observational data from Mu˜noz et al. (2005); Koch et al.

are themselves averaged over the realizations of that system.
We do not count massive failures around the host matched
with M31, but note that Tollerud et al. (2014) showed that
TBTF is similarly extant among the M31 satellites.

The results of Figure 5 are striking, particularly for the
satellites of the MW. On average, the number of massive fail-
ures decreases from ∼ 8 and ∼ 6 in the zero-scatter count,
for the standard and gas-loss cases, down to ∼ 2 − 3 for
both cases when σ increases to 2 dex.5 Moreover, as seen
in the bottom panels, the fraction of realizations that are
completely devoid of massive failures increases steadily with
increasing scatter. For 2 dex of scatter, we ﬁnd that ∼ 15%
of realizations are completely without massive failures, once
we account for the reduction in halo mass due strictly to
the reduced mass of DM particles in cosmological hydrody-
namical simulations. In the right-hand panel we see that the
growing scatter model yields similar results.

Our method is designed to maintain a roughly equal
number of halos (9 in the MW and 7 in the LF) with stellar
masses large enough to be seen above the adopted complete-
ness limits at all σ and γ. This means that for low scatters
(1) even the best-ﬁt α overproduces the stellar mass func-
tion of the MW at low masses (see Figure 2) and (2) the vast
majority (∼ 60% in the MW sample and ∼ 85% in the LF)
of halos above the completeness limit are massive failures.
At high scatters, however, a larger portion of the theoretical
sample is composed of small halos (hosting bright galaxies)
that are more kinematically similar to the known dwarfs.

Relations with very large scatter solve TBTF by oc-
casionally assigning the largest halos a very small stellar
mass – so small that they fall below the completeness limit.
Eﬀectively, these relations solve TBTF by demanding that
the most massive halos do indeed fail to form stars appre-
ciably. The M(cid:63) − Mhalo relation for one such realization
(σ = 2 dex) is plotted explicitly in the left panel of Fig-
ure 6 as black circles; the median relation is indicated by
the cyan line. The open points plot subhalos that lie below
the completeness limit of the MW (indicated by the lower
edge of the shaded band), and which are therefore ineligible
to be massive failures. This realization does not exhibit the
TBTF problem because many of the largest subhalos are as-
signed to host ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, which we assume
are unobservable. By contrast, the best-ﬁt zero-scatter re-
lation (magenta line) predicts that multiple high-mass sub-
halos host galaxies that lie above the completeness cut, and
would therefore be counted as massive failures.
The right panel of Figure 6 shows the two M(cid:63) − Mhalo
models presented in the left panel along with a summary of
recent predictions from high-resolution hydrodynamic simu-
lations. The black lines, which are extrapolated as gray lines
below M(cid:63) = 105M(cid:12), again represent the best-ﬁt models for
σ = 0 (dashed line) and σ = 2 dex (solid line, with shading
to indicate σ and 2σ), but the points indicate the results of
baryonic simulations that include both star formation and

5 We note that there are signiﬁcantly fewer massive failures
counted here than in Garrison-Kimmel et al. (2014b), who found
∼ 15 massive failures in each LF. This is primarily due to the
more stringent cuts that we have used in this work: only halos
assigned enough stellar mass to be above the completeness cut
are eligible to be failures. In the previous work, we selected halos
with peak Vmax > 30 km s−1.

Figure 4. The goodness of ﬁt between the MW/M31 SMFs and
the mock satellite catalogs obtained by applying the growing scat-
ter model to the ELVIS simulations. As in Figure 3, the y-axis
indicates the assumed faint-end log-slope α. Here, however, the x-
axis indicates γ, the log-slope of σ (see Equation 3). For reference,
the upper x-axis shows the resultant scatter at Mpeak = 1010M(cid:12).
The x-axis is inverted such that the scatter increases towards the
right. As in the constant scatter model, a larger σ necessitates
a more rapid fall-oﬀ in M(cid:63)(Mpeak) to avoid overproducing the
observed SMFs. Because we explore even larger σ compared to
the constant scatter model, however, we ﬁnd even steeper slopes
are required.

(2007); Simon & Geha (2007); Mateo et al. (2008) and
Walker et al. (2009). We similarly apply the Wolf et al.
(2010) formula to measurements taken by Kirby et al. (2014)
for the purely dispersion supported galaxies in the LF. How-
ever, two of the LF galaxies included display evidence of
additional rotational support. V1/2 and R1/2 for WLM are
taken from (Leaman et al. 2012), and, following Weiner et al.
(2006), we account for the rotation support of Pegasus dIrr
by adding, in quadrature, the projected rotation velocity
v sin i and the stellar velocity dispersion σstar when using
the Wolf et al. (2010) formula for V1/2 (also see §5.2 of Kirby
et al. 2014).

The results of this counting are summarized in the left
and right panels of Figure 5 for the constant and growing
scatter models, respectively. The upper panels plot the num-
ber of massive failures, either within 300 kpc of the MW
(magenta lines) or in the LF (green lines), as a function of
the assumed scatter σ (left panel) or the assumed log-slope
of the scatter γ (right panel), while the lower panels indi-
cate the fraction of realizations with zero massive failures.
Solid lines indicate the ﬁducial count, roughly comparable
to Garrison-Kimmel et al. (2014b), while the dashed lines
count massive failures after suppressing the Vmax of every
1 − fb ∼ 10% to mock baryonic mass loss that
is not included in the DM-only ELVIS simulations. As in Fig-
ures 3 and 4, the lines plot averages over the systems, which

scatter at the best-ﬁt α at the scatter in the constant scatter model (left) and the growing scatter model (right), plotted such that the
magnitude of the scatter increases towards the right of each plot. Massive failures are deﬁned as (sub)halos with M(cid:63) greater than the
completeness limit (4.5 × 105M(cid:12) in the MW, 4.49 × 106M(cid:12) in the Local Field) without observational counterparts (as in Garrison-
Kimmel et al. 2014b), where the three brightest (by M(cid:63)) subhhalos and the brightest and sixth brightest ﬁeld halo in each realization are
excluded, to match the observational cuts. The magenta lines plot the number of massive failures within 300 kpc of the MW, averaged
over all 12 pairs and the 12 pseudo-pairs; the green line averages over the the ﬁelds of the nine pairs included in our analysis. For each
realization, massive failures within 300 kpc are drawn from the subhalos of the host matched with the MW. The dashed line indicate
1 − fb ∼ 0.91 to mock the eﬀects of a reduced particle
massive failure counts after suppressing the rotation curves of all subhalos by
mass in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. As the scatter increases, the average number of massive failures within 300 kpc in
the constant scatter model (growing scatter model) decreases by ∼ 2/3 (∼ 7/8), and the fraction of realizations with no massive failures
increases to ∼ 10% (∼ 40%). The ﬁeld demonstrates a similar trend, such that ∼ 5% of realizations are without massive failures in the
constant scatter model.

Though the simulations adopt a range of baryonic pre-
scriptions, it is immediately obvious that, taken together,
they qualitatively fail to uniformly sample the σ = 2 dex re-
lation. Speciﬁcally, none of the simulations successfully form
low-mass galaxies in high-mass hosts, which is what is re-
quired to solve TBTF via scatter alone. Alternatively, if the
simulations trace a ﬂatter relation, then the scatter about
that relation is too large to avoid overproducing the SMFs
with low-mass halos hosting bright dwarfs. We caution, how-
ever, that much of the apparent scatter is due to variations
among diﬀerent codes. Many of the individual simulations
produce relations that are rather tight on their own, though
most of those cases are, by eye, somewhat ﬂatter than our
preferred relations.

4 DISCUSSION

Our results highlight the importance of understanding the
nature of the M(cid:63)-Mhalo relation at low masses. They also

indicate that pinpointing the degree of either the scatter or
the slope of the median relation should provide clues to the
other, though it may be impossible to disentangle the two.
Moreover, the level of scatter has clear consequences on cur-
rent small-scale problems in the ΛCDM paradigm of galaxy
formation. Speciﬁcally, a high scatter results in a signiﬁcant
fraction of satellite and LF systems wherein the majority of
the massive (Mhalo ∼ 1010.5M(cid:12)) halos preferentially scat-
ter downward in stellar mass, thereby alleviating TBTF by
assigning the typically problematic halos to host ultra-faint
dwarf galaxies. This requires a steep fall-oﬀ in the median
relation, however. Furthermore, the required scatter is very
high: for σ = 2 dex, 5% of halos will host galaxies that lie a
factor of 104 from the median relation.

Ultimately, however, it is extremely diﬃcult to deter-
mine whether galaxy formation in the Universe truly does
result in (cid:38) 2 dex of scatter in M(cid:63) at ﬁxed Mhalo. A conclusive
answer would require not only an enormous sample of dwarf
galaxies in the ﬁeld, where DM halos have not been stripped
by larger hosts, but measurements of the halo masses of each
of those dwarfs. It would therefore be necessary to trace the
mass well beyond the stars, or to ﬁrmly understand the in-
ner proﬁles of dwarfs such that measurements on small radii
can accurately be extrapolated to the virial radius.

Fortunately, signiﬁcant scatter in M(cid:63)-Mhalo may be in-
ferred from the properties of known galaxies in the MW. For

Figure 6. Left: A sample realization of the MW satellite system, obtained by applying the best-ﬁt σ = 2 dex relation (black circles); the
median relation is indicated by the cyan line. For comparison, the magenta line plots the best-ﬁt zero-scatter relation. The shaded region
roughly indicates the range in stellar masses probed by our method in the MW (constraints from M31 extend to 105M(cid:12)). The upper
edge of this regime is here set by the stellar mass of the SMC, but in general is deﬁned by the second highest M(cid:63) in each realization.
Subhalos that fall below the completeness limit are indicated by open circles. The horizontal dashed line indicates the stellar mass of
Sagittarius, which roughly sets the upper limit on the massive failure sample (the exact limit is set by the third most luminous subhalo
in each realization; see § 3.2); subhalos that fall between this limit and the lower edge of the shaded band are eligible to be massive
failures. The 2 dex case, selected because it has no massive failures, illustrates how scatter in M(cid:63) − Mhalo is able to alleviate TBTF:
many of the most massive subhalos, which have internal kinematics inconsistent with the MW dSphs, are assigned to host ultra-faint
dwarf galaxies that lie in the incomplete regime, and are therefore excluded from the analysis. Right: A comparison of the same two
best-ﬁt relations (black lines, which become gray when extrapolated beyond the regime constrained by our analysis, M(cid:63) < 105M(cid:12)) to a
sample of simulated dwarf galaxies in the literature (references are as indicated in the legend); the shaded regions indicate one and two
standard deviations. If the simulations trace the best-ﬁt zero-scatter relation (dashed line), then the level of scatter exhibited overall will
generally overproduce the local SMFs. Alternatively, if the simulations trace the upward scatter about the 2 dex relation, which aids in
resolving TBTF, then they thus far fail to sample the downward scatter necessary to avoid overproducing the local SMFs. However, a
large sample of halos with 107M(cid:12) < Mpeak < 1011M(cid:12), simulated with identical physics, is necessary to make quantitative statements
regarding the behavior of simulations in this regime.

example, Wheeler et al. (2015) identiﬁed a mass-dependent
cutoﬀ in post-reionization star formation in cosmological
simulations: only halos larger than ∼ 5 × 109M(cid:12) are able
to retain their gas in the presence of a reionizing back-
ground and continue to form stars beyond z ∼ 6. Taken
together with the results of Brown et al. (2014), who showed
that six of the MW ultrafaint (M(cid:63) ∼ 104M(cid:12)) satellites are
dominated by stars older than 12 Gyr, one may easily con-
clude that the ultrafaint galaxies live in halos smaller than
Mhalo ∼ 5 × 109M(cid:12). A large scatter about the median re-
lation, however, would result in several ultra-faints residing
in large dwarfs. This scatter may therefore manifest in the
form of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies with extended star for-
mation histories. As was recently shown by Monelli et al.
(2016), Andromeda XVI may be one such system. We may
also expect to ﬁnd faint, dense galaxies living at the centers
of halos too massive to be altered by the small number of
feedback events from those galaxies.

Our conclusions are largely similar to those of Guo et al.
(2015), who applied semi-analytic galaxy formation models
to DM-only simulations, then selected hosts analogous to
the MW based on the observable properties of the system.

MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2014)

Their models predict highly stochastic galaxy formation at
small mass scales, yielding a large scatter in the stellar mass-
halo mass relation, such that ∼ 10% of their satellite systems
have only three bright halos with Vmax > 30 km/s. Likewise,
we ﬁnd that ∼ 10% of the ELVIS realizations contain a MW
without any massive failures, assuming a scatter of 2 dex.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have explored two-parameter models for
assigning stars to low-mass (Mhalo (cid:46) 1011 M(cid:12)) dark mat-
ter halos in the collisionless ELVIS simulations. We ﬁx the
M(cid:63) − Mhalo relation to that of Behroozi et al. (2013a) for
Mhalo >∼ 1011M(cid:12) and allow the scatter σ in this relation to
vary between 0 and 2 dex, then constrain the best-ﬁt log-
slope α. Brieﬂy, we ﬁnd that:

• As the assumed scatter increases, the median relation
must become increasingly steep to avoid overproducing the
observed stellar mass functions of the MW, M31, and the
nearby Local Field.
• The best-ﬁt log-slope α is signiﬁcantly steeper than the

z = 0 slope predicted by B13, which overproduces local
galaxy counts (see Garrison-Kimmel et al. 2014a). In con-
trast, the best-ﬁt zero-scatter relation nearly matches that
predicted in Garrison-Kimmel et al. (2014a), who derived α
from the faint-end slope of the SMF measured by the GAMA
survey (Baldry et al. 2012). Finally, we ﬁnd slightly shal-
lower log-slopes than those quoted by Moster et al. (2013),
particularly at z = 0, even when compared to the ﬁeld. How-
ever, their log-slope at z ∼ 1, roughly the median infall red-
shift of subhalos around MW-size hosts (Wetzel et al. 2015),
is only slightly steeper than our measured best-ﬁt αsats.
• At the best-ﬁt α, the average number of massive fail-
ures, both within 300 kpc of the MW and in the LF, de-
creases with increasing σ. After mocking the eﬀects of bary-
onic mass loss, we ﬁnd that the MW satellite system may
be only a ∼ 15% outlier, if there are ∼ 2 decades of scatter
about the median M(cid:63) − Mhalo relation.
• Mass-dependent scatter produces qualitatively similar
results to mass-independent models but leads to even steeper
relations for an equivalent scatter at Mpeak = 1010M(cid:12), as
smaller galaxies are more likely to appear in the complete
regime for growing scatter models.
• Currently, simulations are able to reproduce the up-
ward scatter that solves TBTF (by placing bright galaxies
in small halos), but are thus far unable to reproduce the
downward scatter (placing faint galaxies in overly-massive
halos) necessary to avoid overproducing the observed stellar
mass functions.

These results are largely independent of the exact model
used to set M(cid:63). Together, they suggest that scatter in
M(cid:63) − Mhalo alone is unlikely to explain the TBTF problem,
but that it may contribute to the eventual solution, along
with ram-pressure stripping and internal feedback processes.
Nonetheless, it is encouraging for the ΛCDM paradigm of
galaxy formation that scatter in M(cid:63) − Mhalo, which simula-
tions predict to at least some degree, helps to eliminate the
massive failures. As yet, however, there remains no direct
evidence for the required scatter.
