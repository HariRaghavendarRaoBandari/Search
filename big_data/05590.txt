LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure with polar and non-polar constituents has been shown to exhibit
interface metallic conductivity due to fractional charge transfer to the interface. The interface recon-
struction by electron redistribution along (001) orientation, in which half of an electron is transferred
per two dimensional unit cell to the adjacent planes, resulting in a net transfer of half of the charge,
to both the interface and top most atomic planes, has been ascribed to a polar discontinuity at the
interface in the Polar Catastrophe model. This avoids the divergence of electrostatic potential, as
the number of layers are increased, producing an oscillatory electric ﬁeld and ﬁnite potential. Akin
to the description of charge fractionalization in quasi one-dimensional polyacetylene by the ﬁeld
theoretic Jackiw-Rebbi model with fermions interacting with topologically non-trivial background
ﬁeld, we show an analogous connection between polar catastrophe model and Bell-Rajaraman model,
where the charge fractionalization occurs in the soliton free sector as an end eﬀect.

INTRODUCTION

The quasi-two dimensional electron gas formed at the
interface of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure has been
shown to have interesting properties such as metallic con-
ductivity [1–4], ferromagnetism [5, 6], superconductivity
[7] and the coexistence of magnetic order and supercon-
ductivity [8]. This heterostructure consists of LaAlO3
ﬁlm deposited layer by layer over SrTiO3 substrate along
the (001) orientation. LaAlO3 has alternating positively
charged (LaO)+ and negatively charged (AlO2)− atomic
planes along the (001) orientation. The electric ﬁeld that
arises between these oppositely charged atomic planes
gives rise to an in-built electrostatic potential that di-
verges with the thickness. When this polar LaAlO3 is de-
posited over non-polar SrTiO3 substrate, which consists
of alternating neutral (SrO)0 and (TiO2)0 atomic planes,
the polar discontinuity that arises at the interface, causes
this heterostructure to be electrostatically unstable. The
stable LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure requires interface
reconstruction which could be ionic reconstruction in-
volving lattice distortion or cationic inter-mixing. Polar
catastrophe model, a simple electrostatic model, was pro-
posed to explain the formation of two dimensional elec-
tron gas at the interface of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostruc-
ture [1, 9]. This model proposes that the interface is re-
constructed by electron redistribution in which one half
of an electron or a hole is transferred per two dimensional
unit cell along the (001) orientation depending on the in-
terface structure. This charge transfer results in a net
transfer of half of an electron or a hole to the interface.
Although this model does not explain many eﬀects, such
as strong polar distortions that delay the onset of metal-
lic conductivity [10] and the reversible metal-insulator
transition upon external bias [3, 11], this gives a possible
explanation for the formation of two dimensional electron
gas at the interface of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure.
In relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, charge fractional-
ization has been shown to occur by Jackiw and Rebbi

in the case of spinless fermions interacting
(JR) [12],
with topologically non-trivial background ﬁeld. The phe-
nomenon of charge fractionalization has been successfully
used by SSH model to explain the observed conductivity
in the quasi-one dimensional polyacetylene [13–15]. The
similarity between these two diﬀerent models has been
established by Jackiw and Schrieﬀer [16]. Both models
give rise to spontaneous breaking of the reﬂection sym-
metry, which results in the formation of doubly degener-
ate ground states. There exists soliton excitations which
interpolate between these two degenerate ground states.
In both cases, the charge conjugation symmetry assures
the existence of unpaired zero energy state. The charge
is + 1
2 if the zero energy state is occupied, otherwise it is
− 1
2 . Bell and Rajaraman [17], in studying the system of
discrete lattice sites related to the polyacetylene model,
have shown that fermion number fractionalization can
occur in the soliton free sector, as an end eﬀect.

In this paper, we demonstrate the analogy between
the polar catastrophe model which explains the forma-
tion of two dimensional electron gas at the interface of
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure and the Bell and Ra-
jaraman model where charge fractionalization occurs as
an end eﬀect. By this, we show the ﬁrst physical system
where Bell-Rajaraman model can be applied to explain
the observed phenomenon.

II. POLAR CATASTROPHE MODEL (PCM)

ABO3 perovskites have alternating AO and BO2
atomic planes along the (001) orientation. SrTiO3 is
of A2+B4+O3 type and has alternating neutral (SrO)0
and (TiO2)0 atomic planes. However, LaAlO3 is of
A3+B3+O3 type, which has alternating (LaO)+ and
(TiO2)− atomic planes. Polar LaAlO3 has an in-built
electrostatic potential that diverges with the thickness.
Polar discontinuity that arises at the interface of this
polar and non-polar heterostructure makes it electro-

FIG. 1. (001) oriented LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure. (a)
Unreconstructed (LaO)+/(TiO2)0 interface. SrTiO3 has al-
ternating neutral atomic planes and LaAlO3 has alternatively
charged polar planes. The non-zero electric ﬁeld between the
oppositely charged atomic planes of LaAlO3 creates an in-
built electrostatic potential that diverges with the thickness
of LaAlO3. (b) Unreconstructed (AlO2)−/(SrO)0 interface.
In this case, the electrostatic potential diverges negatively
with the thickness.

FIG. 2. Polar discontinuity at the interface forces electron
redistribution along the (001) orientation. (a) Half an elec-
tron per two dimensional unit cell is transferred in the case of
(LaO)+/(TiO2)0 interface. This adds a net half electron to
the neutral TiO2 plane near the interface and to the top most
AlO2 plane (not shown here). (b) In (AlO2)−/(SrO)0 inter-
face, half a hole per two dimensional unit cell is transferred.
In both cases, the charge redistribution produces an interface
dipole that changes the electric ﬁeld to oscillate about zero
and the potential to remain ﬁnite.

statically unstable and the stable structure requires in-
terface reconstruction. Since cations in the perovskite
structures can have mixed valance states, energetically
the electron redistribution along the (001) orientation is
favorable than any other form of interface reconstruc-
tion. LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure can have two dif-
(LaO)+/(TiO2)0 (FIG.1a)
ferent interface structures:
and (AlO2)−/(SrO)0 (FIG.1b).

According to polar catastrophe model, one half of an
electron (or a hole) is transferred per two dimensional
unit cell in (LaO)+/(TiO2)0 (or (AlO2)−/(SrO)0) inter-
face, hence it is of n-type (or p-type) interface. This
results in a net transfer of half electron or hole to the
neutral layer at the interface and to the top most layer
of LaAlO3 and produces an interface dipole that causes
the electric ﬁeld to oscillate about zero and potential to
remain ﬁnite (FIG.2).

However, experimentally only the n-type interface,
(LaO)+/(TiO2)0, was found conducting and the p-type
interface, (AlO2)−/(SrO)0, remained insulating. Since
Ti cation can exist in Ti3+ and Ti4+ valance states, in
the n-type interface, a net half electron is transferred
from LaAlO3 into the Ti 3d conduction band of SrTiO3,
close to the interface that gives rise to conduction. It was
experimentally proved that oxygen vacancy and cation
inter-mixing do not contribute to the interface recon-

struction and hence to the conductivity observed in the
n-type interface [1, 18]. However, there exists a thresh-
old thickness (3 unit cells) of LaAlO3, above which the
metallic conductivity was observed [2, 18]. From opti-
cal studies, it was shown that up to the thickness of 3
unit cells, the transferred electrons are trapped in the
localized states of interface created by lattice distortion
[19, 20]. Band structure studies imply that the lattice
distortion due to ionic relaxations are more at the outer
layers of LaAlO3 ﬁlm that are adjacent to the SrTiO3
and to the air; the distortion decreases and eventually
vanishes as the thickness of LaAlO3 is increased [21, 22].
Further the electron carrier density measured by optical
conductivity studies was found to agree with the value
predicted by PCM [19, 20], which supports the validity
of PCM.

In the case of p-type interface, a net hole transfer is
necessary to avoid the potential divergence but the un-
availability of mixed valance states to accommodate this
half hole requires atomic reconstruction. It was experi-
mentally shown that the p-type interface is reconstructed
by oxygen vacancy, however, the oxygen vacancies which
generally act as electron donor do not give rise to any
conduction in the p-type interface [9].

and (AlO2)− planes and a neutral (TiO2)0 plane. (b) Atomic
planes are displaced from their initial position. (LaO)+ plane
is displaced by an amount α and (AlO2)0 planes are displaced
by an amount β (not speciﬁed here). The inter-planer dis-
tance changes by (−)nδ(= α + β) for adjacent planes.

III. COMPARISION WITH BELL AND

RAJARAMAN MODEL

A two dimensional view of (LaO)+/(TiO2)0 interface
is shown in FIG.3a. As the polar discontinuity at in-
terface forces the electron redistribution along the (001)
orientation, we consider only the inter-planar electron
hopping along the z-direction. We use the Hamiltonian
of polyacetylene model used in Ref. [17], which describes
the nearest-neighbor electron hopping in one dimension
and its interaction with the lattice displacement, that
was taken as given. The displacement of atomic planes
in the (LaO)+/(TiO2)0 interface is considered as follows.
The (LaO)+ atomic planes are displaced by an amount
α and the (AlO2)− planes are displaced by an amount β.
The inter-planar distance between the adjacent planes
changes by (−)nδ(= α + β) (FIG. 3b).
For this system, the Hamiltonian can be written in the

                         LaAlTiOa+δ (= α+β)a -δ (= α+β)2a0+++++-----(a)(b)and

Following the arguments of Ref.

[17] the charge con-
jugation symmetry of the above two equations assures
the existence of a zero energy state for the system of
2M + 1 atomic planes. Depending on whether M is
odd or even the zero energy states are localized either
at atomic planes labeled by odd numbers or at atomic
planes labeled by even numbers. Further, by neglecting
spin degree of freedom, the charge operators at lattice
site m and n can be deﬁned as,

and

(13)

As a consequence of the choice of 2M + 1 atomic
planes, when zero energy and positive energy states
are unoccupied the charge is − 1
2 and when they are
occupied, it is 1
2 . It was shown that these half integral

4

charges are localized, where the zero energy functions
are localized. This is completely analogous to the
PCM,
in which the transfer of half charge per two
dimensional unit cell results in a net transfer of half
charge to the end atomic planes, which are (TiO2)0
neutral plane at the interface and the top (AlO2)− plane.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have compared the electron redis-
tribution along the (001) orientation of LaAlO3/SrTiO3
heterostructure proposed by polar catastrophe model to
the Bell-Rajaraman model. In PCM, half an electron per
two dimensional unit cell is transferred along (001) ori-
entation, across 2M + 1 atomic layers of LaAlO3/SrTiO3
heterostructure. This adds net half electron to the neu-
tral TiO2 layer and top AlO2 layer. This is completely
equivalent to the electron fractionalization process dis-
cussed in Bell-Rajaraman model, where the half integral
charge is due to the speciﬁc choice of 2M + 1 lattice sites
and the conjugation symmetry of the Hamiltonian. This
is the ﬁrst application of Bell-Rajaraman model to the
best of authors’ knowledge.
