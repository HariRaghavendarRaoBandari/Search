We investigate the resonant quantum dynamics of a multi-qubit ensemble in a microcavity. Both
the quantum-dot subsystem and the microcavity mode are pumped coherently. We found that the
microcavity photon statistics depends on the phase diﬀerence of the driving lasers which is not the
case for the photon intensity at resonant driving. This way, one can manipulate the two-photon
correlations. In particular, higher degrees of photon correlations and, eventually, stronger intensi-
ties are obtained. Furthermore, the microcavity photon statistics exhibits steady-state oscillatory
behaviors as well as asymmetries.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum dots or artiﬁcial atoms can have sharp opti-
cal transitions, similar to those of real atoms [1]. Apply-
ing a coherent laser ﬁeld, one can address those transi-
tions, emphasizing in particular, a two-level system. This
way, a number of eﬀects can be obtained and some of
them are known from pumping of real atoms with coher-
ent laser ﬁelds. Particularly, resonance ﬂuorescence from
a coherently driven semiconductor quantum dot in a cav-
ity was experimentally investigated in [2]. The observa-
tion of the Mollow triplet [3] from a quantum dot system
was reported in [4, 5]. Dephasing of triplet-sideband op-
tical emission of a resonantly driven InAs/GaAs quan-
tum dot inside a microcavity was studied in Ref. [6].
Furthermore, cascaded single-photon emission from the
Mollow triplet sidebands of a quantum dot as well as
spectral photon correlations were obtained in [7]. A pro-
nounced interaction between the quantum dot and the
cavity has been observed even for detunings of many cav-
ity linewidths [8]. In the small Rabi frequency regime,
subnatural linewidth single photons from a quantum dot
were obtained too, in [9]. Moreover, self-homodyne mea-
surement of a dynamic Mollow triplet in the solid state
systems was performed recently [10].

When two or more quantum dots are close to each
other on the emission wavelength scale then collective
interactions come into play [11–16].
In particular, su-
perradiance in an ensemble of quantum dots was exper-
imentally observed in [17] while the dynamics of quan-
tum dot superradiance was investigated in [18]. The
collective ﬂuorescence and decoherence of a few nearly
identical quantum dots and superbunched photons via a
strongly pumped near-equispaced multi-particle system
were analyzed in [19] and [20], respectively. Dicke states
in multiple quantum dots systems were discussed too, in
Ref. [21]. Furthermore, sub- and super-radiance phenom-
ena in quantum dot nanolasers were investigated in [22].
The collective modes of quantum dot ensembles in micro-

cavities were obtained as well [23]. Finally, entanglement
of two quantum dots was investigated in Ref. [24].

Here, we investigate the dynamics of a two-level quan-
tum dot ensemble inside a microcavity. However, the
developed approach applies to a real atomic sample as
well. The microcavity mode together with the qubit sub-
system are pumped with two distinct coherent electro-
magnetic ﬁelds. When the laser that resonantly pumps
the qubit ensemble is moderately intense, i.e. the corre-
sponding Rabi frequency is larger than the qubit-cavity
coupling strength as well as the spontaneous and cav-
ity decay rates, we found enhanced photon-photon cor-
relations.
In particular, the photon statistics displays
oscillatory steady-state behaviors due to an interplay be-
tween the cavity and sponatenous emission decay rates.
Furthermore, the microcavity photon statistics depends
on the phase diﬀerence of the applied coherent sources
that can be a convenient mechanism to inﬂuence the
second-order photon-photon correlations. An asymmet-
rical steady-state behavior of the second-order photon
correlation function versus cavity-ﬁeld detuning is ob-
served due to the relative phase dependence.

The article is organized as follows.

In Section II we
describe the analytical approach and the system of inter-
est, and obtain the corresponding equations of motion.
Section III deals with discussions of the obtained results.
The Summary is given in Section IV.

II. QUANTUM DYNAMICS OF A PUMPED
MULTI-QUBIT SYSTEM IN A MICROCAVITY

The Hamiltonian describing a wavelength-sized collec-
tion of pumped two-level artiﬁcial (or real) atomic system
possessing the frequency ω0 and embedded in a microcav-
ity of frequency ωc is:

H = ∆a†a + g(a†S− + aS+) + ǫ(a†eiφ1 + ae−iφ1 )
(1)

+ Ω(S+eiφ2 + S−e−iφ2).

Here, both the atomic sample, and the microcavity
mode, are interacting with coherent sources of frequency
in a frame rotating at ωL, and
ωL1 = ωL2 ≡ ωL,

j=1 S+

we have assumed that ω0 = ωL.
In the Hamiltonian
(1) the ﬁrst term describes the cavity free energy with
∆ = ωc − ωL, while the second one characterize the
interaction of the quantum dot system with the micro-
cavity mode via the coupling g. The third term takes
into account the interaction of the microcavity mode
with the ﬁrst coherent light source of amplitude ǫ and
phase φ1. The last term considers the interaction of the
qubit subsystem with the second laser with Ω and φ2 be-
ing the corresponding Rabi frequency and phase. The
j=1 |2ij jh1| and
S− = [S+]† obey the commutation relations for su(2)
[S+, S−] = 2Sz and [Sz, S±] = ±S±. Here

ground state of the jth qubit, respectively. Further, a†
and a are the creation and the annihilation operator of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld (EMF), and satisfy the stan-
dard bosonic commutation relations, i.e., [a, a†] = 1, and
[a, a] = [a†, a†] = 0. We have supposed here that the
quantum dot system couples to the laser and microcav-
ity ﬁelds with the same coupling strength, i.e. the linear
extension of the quantum dot ensemble is smaller than
the relevant emission wavelength.

collective operators S+ = PN
Sz = PN

j =PN

In what follows, we are interested in the laser dom-
inated regime where Ω ≫ {g, γ, κ} (here γ and κ are
the spontaneous and cavity decay rates, respectively) and
shall describe our system using the dressed-states formal-
ism [11, 25]:

|1ij =

1
√2

(|¯1ij + |¯2ij ),

|2ij =

1
√2

(|¯2ij − |¯1ij).

(2)

Before applying the transformation (2) we performed the
substitution a†eiφ1 = ˜a† and S+eiφ2 = ˜S+ and dropped
the tilde afterwards. Restricting ourselves to values of
∆ ≪ Ω and secular approximation, one then arrives at
the following master equation describing our system:

d
dt

Here

ρ(t) + i[H0, ρ] = −Γ0[Rz, Rzρ] − Γ{[R+, R−ρ]

+ [R−, R+ρ]} − κ[a†, aρ] + H.c..

(3)

H0 = ∆a†a + Rz(g∗

0a† + g0a) + ǫ(a† + a),
where g0 = geiφ/2 and g∗
0 = ge−iφ/2 with φ = φ1 − φ2.
Γ0 = γ/4 and Γ = (γ + γd)/4 with 2γ being the single-
qubit spontaneous decay rate, while γd is the quan-
tum dot dephasing rate. The new quasispin opera-
tors, i.e. R+ = PN
j=1 |¯2ij jh¯1|, R− = [R+]† and Rz =
PN
j=1(|¯2ij jh¯2| − |¯1ij jh¯1|) are operating in the dressed
state picture. They obey the following commutation rela-
tions: [R+, R−] = Rz and [Rz, R±] = ±2R±. Notice the
dependence of the coupling strength g0 on the phase dif-
ference of the applied coherent sources. Additional and
diﬀerent phase dependent eﬀects can be found in [13, 14].

In the next subsection, we shall obtain the equations
of motion of variables of interest in order to calculate the
second-order microcavity photon correlation function:
g(2)(0) = ha†a†aai/(ha†ai)2. Values of g(2)(0) smaller
than unity describe sub-Poissonian photon statistics and
it is a quantum eﬀect. Poissonian photon-statistics has
g(2)(0) = 1. g(2)(0) > 1 characterizes super-Poissonian
photon statistics. In particular for thermal light one has
g(2)(0) = 2 and, therefore, we are interested in correla-
tions larger than two, i.e. g(2)(0) > 2.

A. Equations of motion

The system of equations (4) is not complete. Addi-
tional equations are necessary for the qubit subsystem
operators hRzi, hR2
zi etc. However, we shall represent
the steady-state expectation values of the ﬁeld corre-
lators ha†ai and ha†2
a2i via the quantum dot opera-
tors alone. The expectation values of the quantum dot
operators will be evaluated in a diﬀerent way as de-
scribed in the next subsection. Note that in deriving

the above system of equations we have used the relation:
R2
z/4 + (R+R− + R−R+)/2 = j(j + 1), where j = N/2.

B. Qubit subsystem correlations

As it was mentioned in the previous subsection, the
steady-state values of ﬁeld correlators as well as the
qubit-ﬁeld correlators can be expressed via the expec-
tation values of the dressed-state inversion hRn
z i, {n ∈
1, 2, 3, 4}. These qubit-subsystem operators can be ob-
tained from the master equation (3) by observing that
any diagonal form of operators R+mRn
z R−m, {m, n ∈
0, 1,···}, commute with H0. Therefore, the steady-state
values of these operators are determined only by the dis-
sipation part of the master equation. It is not diﬃcult to
show that the steady-state solution of the qubit subsys-
tem master equation is [11]:

ρq =

ˆI

N + 1

,

(5)

where ˆI is the unity operator. Consider an atomic coher-
ent state |ni, denoting a symmetrized N -atom state in
which N − n particles are in the lower dressed state |˜1i
and n atoms are excited to the upper dressed state |˜2i.
One can calculate the expectation values of any atomic
interest using the relations: R+|ni =
correlators of
p(N − n)(n + 1)|n+1i, R−|ni = pn(N − n + 1)|n−1i,
In particular, the steady-

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The general expression for the second-order photon
correlation function is too cumbersome and, therefore,
we shall represent it analytically for few particular cases.
If g0 = 0 one has g(2)(0) = 1 while when {ǫ, ∆} = 0 we
have:

One can observe here that the second-order correlation
function does not depend on microcavity-dot coupling

strength g0. This is the case also for ǫ = 0 and ∆ 6= 0.
However, in general, i.e. when ǫ 6= 0, the microcavity
photon correlation function depends on g0. Note that the
two-photon correlator ha†a†aai ∝ N 4 while the photon
intensity ha†ai ∝ N 2 and, thus, we have an enhancement
of these correlations due to collectivity.
In what follows, using the system of equations (4) and
for some particular cases the expression (7), we shall de-
scribe in details the microcavity second-order photon cor-
relation function for various parameters of interest. We
proceed by considering that the microcavity mode is not
additionally pumped, i.e. ǫ = 0. Figure (1) shows the
dependence of the second-order correlation function as a
function of κ/Γ for various cavity detunings and num-
ber of quantum dots involved. At the exact resonance,
that is ∆/Γ = 0, one can observe larger photon corre-
lations, i.e. g(2)(0) = 3, while their intensity is being
also enhanced due to collectivity. The picture is diﬀerent
for the oﬀ-resonance case. As long as κ ≪ ∆ 6= 0 the
photon statistics is similar to that of a thermal light, i.e.
g(2)(0) = 2. However, for intermediate detunings one
can observe a oscillatory behavior of the second-order
correlation function due to the interplay of κ and Γ. As
the detuning is further increased the two-photon correla-
tion shows a dip because of the oﬀ-resonant driving (see

does not depend on φ in this particular case. There-
fore, the phase diﬀerence appears in the unnormalized
second-order correlator ha†a†aai. This happens due to
feasibility of scattering two photons from diﬀerent ap-
plied coherent sources giving rise to interferences, i.e.,
phase dependent eﬀects. In Fig. 2(a) one can observe an
asymmetrical steady-state behavior of the second-order
correlation function for φ = π/4. Furthermore, the max-
imum at ∆/Γ = 0 for φ = 0 turns into a minimum
for φ = π/2 (see the solid and short-dashed curves in
Fig. 2a, respectively). Thus, the relative phase between
the applied coherent sources can be a convenient tool
to manipulate the photon statistics. Particularly, one
can generate coherent light, i.e. g(2)(0) ≈ 1, despite of
spontaneous incoherent photon scattering into the cav-
ity mode (see Fig. 2b). Again, the photon intensity as
well as their second-order correlations are enhanced due
to collectivity.

increase the number of quantum dots.

To further understand the steady-state behaviors of
the photon-photon correlation function for ǫ 6= 0, in Fig-
ure (2) we plot g(2)(0) again. However in this case, one
observes a dependence of the normalized second-order
correlation function g(2)(0) on the phase diﬀerence φ of
the applied coherent sources. It is easy to show that the

In summary, we have investigated the interaction of a
collection of laser-pumped artiﬁcial atoms embedded in a
leaking optical microcavity. Particularly, we were inter-
ested in photon statistics of the scattered photons into
the cavity mode. We have found that the photon statis-
tics depends on the phase diﬀerence between the coherent
sources pumping the quantum dot system and the cav-
ity mode, respectively. Various steady-state behaviors of
photon correlations were shown to occur.
