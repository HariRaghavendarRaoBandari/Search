Abstract:

We propose a stringy construction giving rise to a class of interacting and non-supersym-
metric CFT’s in six dimensions. Such theories may be obtained as an IR conformal
ﬁxed point of an RG ﬂow ending up in a (1, 0) theory in the UV. We provide the due
holographic evidence in the context of massive type IIA on AdS7 × M3, where M3 is
topologically an S3.
In particular, in this paper we present a 10d ﬂow solution which
may be interpreted as a non-BPS bound state of NS5, D6 and D6 branes. Moreover,
by adopting its 7d eﬀective desciption, we are able to holographically compute the free
energy and the operator spectrum in the novel IR conformal ﬁxed point.

1. Introduction

The discovery of interacting six dimensional superconformal ﬁeld theories has been a
major paradigm shift in our way of thinking about quantum ﬁeld theories. This new
awareness was made possible by a study of various decoupling limits in string theory
constructions. Even though 6d SCFT’s are local quantum ﬁeld theories, they resist a La-
grangian description and their low energy degrees of freedoms include tensionless strings.

Probably the most celebrated example of six-dimensional interacting theory is the
supersymmetric (2, 0) theory living on the worldvolume of a stack of coincident M5 branes
[1]. More precisely, this is a special case of a larger class of (2, 0) theories having an ADE
classiﬁcation which can be obtained through geometric engineering in type IIB string
theory [2]. Another prominent example is the 6d (1, 0) supersymmetric theory. Recently
there has been revived interest in the topic because of the proposed classiﬁcation of [3, 4].
Such theories were known for a long time as they also appeared in the context of massive
IIA string theory with intersecting NS5–D6–D8 branes [5–7].

All the SCFT’s described by type IIA brane intersections admit a holographic descrip-
tion. The relationship between 6d (1, 0) theories and AdS7 solutions of massive type IIA
supergravity has been clariﬁed in a series of recent works [8–10]. Moreover, the existence
of a consistent truncation of massive type IIA supergravity on AdS7 × S3 was proven
in [11]. This means that we can use a half-maximal (i.e. 16 supercharges) 7d gauged su-
pergravity restricted to the gravity multiplet as an eﬀective description of the 10d physics.
In particular, given an AdS7 solution of gauged supergravity, its string theory lift can be
constructed explicitly.

All the AdS7 solutions of half-maximal gauged supergravity have been classiﬁed in
[12]. A striking outcome of this analysis is the presence of non-supersymmetric solutions.
More surprisingly, a computation of the full perturbative spectrum of one of the non-
supersymmetric vacua conﬁrms an absence of tachyons. In light of these results, the aim
of this paper is to give a complete holographic interpretation of this non-supersymmetric
AdS7 solution. In particular we will provide evidence for the existence of a new class of
non-supersymmetric CFT6 dual ﬁxed points.

The existence of 6d superconformal ﬁxed points in string theory is a well estab-
lished fact. To the best of our knowledge a string theoretical description of a fully
non-supersymmetric 6d ﬁxed point is still unknown. The goal of this paper is to give
evidence for the existence of a class of non-supersymmetric CFT’s, and we also pursue a
ﬁrst step in the string theoretic understanding of these 6d CFT’s.

In this work we address the problem in terms of holographic RG ﬂows [13]. We use a
static non-BPS domain wall (DW) solution, discovered some time ago in [14], interpolating
between the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric AdS7 vacua. This is interpreted

3

as the ﬁrst evidence of the existence of a 6d RG ﬂow connecting the supersymmetric
solution in the UV with the non-supersymmetric one in the IR. Additionally, we construct
the corresponding 10d ﬂow which reconciles the 7d eﬀective description with the string
theoretical susy breaking process.

The second evidence comes from a study of holographic quantities associated with the
new CFT6. We are able to check the free energy of the corresponding AdS7 solution and
its large N behavior. Following [15], we are able to test positively the validity of the
6d “a-theorem”1 in our 6d RG ﬂow using the identiﬁcation between central charge and
stress energy tensor of the 7d supergravity DW solution. Finally we are able to track
the evolution of conformal dimensions for the operator spectrum and to identify which
operator is responsible for triggering the ﬂow.

The third and ﬁnal evidence comes from the susy breaking description at the level of
brane constructions in string theory. We propose a mechanism, along the line of [22–24]
which involves an explicit use of D6 branes in the original massive IIA brane system
together with a jump in the ﬂuxes in order to keep the total D6 brane charge unaﬀected.
This implies that the charges of supergravity at inﬁnity are not modiﬁed and we obtain
a faithful description of holographic states in the same theory. The presence of D6’s
is an explicit source of susy breaking which generates a non-supersymmetric metastable
state in the tensor branch of the original (1, 0) theory. This metastability ends at the
new interacting ﬁxed point, where the distance between NS5 branes goes to zero and
conformal symmetry is restored. This precisely corresponds to the process described
within the holographic RG ﬂow.

Working with AdS/CFT outside the supersymmetric realm is certainly more subtle. A
common problem in these cases is that non-supersymmetric solutions usually suﬀer from
gravitational instabilities. An interesting aspect of the class of non-supersymmetric AdS7
solutions of this paper is their stability both at a perturbative and at a non-perturbative
level. We provide a conﬁrmation for our claim by reformulating a positive energy theorem
type of argument. The fact that the gravity solution we are using is free from these
instabilities makes it a sensible tool to test its dual non-supersymmetric CFT6.

A ﬁnal comment concerns the role of D6 branes in our construction. Here we provide
a qualitative check of the tension of gravity solutions at both end points of the DW.
This check conﬁrms our expectation about the possibility of tracing the presence of susy
breaking anti-branes directly in the gravity solution. We also make some preliminary
comments about the full near-horizon solution of non-BPS NS5–D6–D8 brane intersections
in massive IIA, which is an unknown terrain. Of course, with this analysis we only
scratched the surface. Given the new and intriguing potential applications to holography,
it is a major challenge to reﬁne our understanding of brane solutions in massive IIA string

1Despite the holographic evidence [16], there is still not a general proof of the a-theorem for six
dimensional CFT’s. In this case the dilaton eﬀective action analysis turns out to be inconclusive [17, 18].
See also [19] for further complications. Finally, the classiﬁcation of supersymmetric deformations of 6d
SCFTs has been carried out in [20, 21].

This paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we ﬁrst review the stringy construction
of (1, 0) SCFT’s and then discuss susy breaking and tachyon condensation as a mechanism
for producing novel non-supersymmetric conformal ﬁxed points in 6d. Subsequently,
in section 3 we move to the description of those non-supersymmetric AdS7 vacua in
massive type IIA supergravity that provide gravity duals of the aforementioned CFT6.
Moreover we give a 10d ﬂow solution interpolating between the supersymmetric and the
non-supersymmetric vacua. Finally, we show how all the above information is captured by
a 7d gauged supergravity. In section 4, adopting this 7d eﬀective desciption, we perform
the holographic computation of the free energy and determine the operator spectrum of
its dual CFT6. In section 5, we ﬁrst comment on the stability of the non-supersymmetric
AdS vacuum, both at a perturbative and non-perturbative level. Later we include a
computation of the eﬀective tension of the sourcing brane system allowing us to argue for
the presence of anti-branes. Finally in section 6, we conclude by adding some physical
remarks and some hints at future directions to be pursued. Some extra technical material
concerning supergravity may be found in appendices A and B.

2. 6d (1, 0) SCFT’s and susy breaking

As predicted by string theory, there are many diﬀerent manifestations of six-dimensional
superconformal ﬁeld theories. In this section we will focus on 6d (1, 0) SCFT’s obtained
through NS5–D6–D8 brane conﬁgurations in massive IIA theory. The reason for this
choice is that this class of theories is particularly useful for our holographic purposes,
although this fact will be clearer only in the next section. Moreover, the brane construction
is very eﬃcient to visualize our proposal for a susy breaking process which relies on the
explicit presence of anti-branes.

2.1. Brane engineering

We begin by reviewing an important class of supersymmetric 6d theories which have
known gravity duals. These were originally introduced by Hanany and Zaﬀaroni in [5].
See also [6, 7].

The basic idea is to start from the Hanany-Witten (HW) [25] setup, whose basic
ingredients are NS5, D5 and D3 branes. We place a D3 brane with worldvolume (0126)
together with an NS5 brane with worldvolume ﬁlling (012345) and a D5 brane on (012789).
Performing three diﬀerent T-dualities respectively in the directions (345) leads to the
following brane conﬁguration:

This system can be visualized in ﬁgure 1. The D6 branes stretch along the x6 direction,
the D8 branes look like vertical walls and the NS5’s are localized at points along the x6
line on which the D6’s are assumed to end. The physical intuition about multiple branes
conﬁgurations is that the low energy dynamics is characterized by the lowest dimensional
brane in the setup.
In this case, we have a 6d supersymmetric theory with a (1, 0)
supersymmetry. As we can see from the brane system, there is an SO(3) symmetry on
the 789 directions which represents the SU(2) R-symmetry of the (1, 0) theory. A crucial
diﬀerence with respect to the HW setup is that here the NS5 branes give rise to a tensor
multiplet that contributes to the spectrum of the 6d theory. The worldvolume theory of
the D8 branes has some inﬁnite directions, which may be seen as a frozen background by
the 6d theory thus generating a global symmetry.

In ﬁgure 1, we have N NS5 branes at various position x6

i , ki D6 branes stretched within
the intervals between to consecutive locations of NS5’s. We denote by wi the number of

inherited by the reduction of the D6 branes’ worldvolume theory along x6. As in the HW
setup the distances between NS5 branes are associated to the gauge couplings of each
factor. Namely, for the i-th factor we have the following relation

(2.2)

where φ6
i denotes the scalar ﬁeld in the (1, 0) tensor multiplet associated with the posi-
tion x6
i . Notice that the presence of D8 branes in the theory implies that we are working
in massive IIA with F(0) = ±k for very large positive and negative x6. Therefore, the
M-theory lift of this conﬁguration is still not known.

All the theories described here have an analogous of the Coulomb branch, in 6d called
tensor branch, parametrized by real scalars in the tensor multiplet, which can be inter-
preted as the relative positions of the NS5’s along x6. If we go to the origin of the tensor
branch, where the relative distances between the solitonic branes is zero, we expect the
appearance of tensionless strings as new degrees of freedom in the theory. Gauge factors
associated with pairs of coinciding NS5 branes are strongly coupled in this limit. It is

7

widely believed that it is not possible to treat this kind of interactions with the usual
paradigm of a continuum Lagrangian description, i.e. as perturbations a Gaussian ﬁxed
point. Such a phenomenon is instead interpreted as a sign of RG interacting ﬁxed points.
For this reason, these theories are usually referred to as “non-Lagrangian”. Thanks to
the increasing interest in such theories, an incredible amount of novel examples thereof
has been found in the recent years.

Many new properties of the six-dimensional (1, 0) theories we described so far were
recently pointed out in the work of [9]. The idea there was to analyze in detail the
boundary conditions for the D6 branes ending on the stack of D8’s in analogy with
the three dimensional case worked out in [26]. It turns out that separating D8 branes
create new Higgs branch deformations for the 7d gauged theory living on the D6 brane
segments stretched between D8 branes. In this way, starting from the interacting theory
and performing Higgs and tensor branch deformations, the Hanany-Zaﬀaroni brane system
is obtained as a result.

When looking at the theory in the tensor branch, there are certain general properties
of the underlying brane system that should always be taken into account. Moving a D8
brane along the x6 direction and passing trough an NS5 brane will create or annihilate the
appropriate number of D6 branes as dictated by the HW eﬀect. Moreover, the anomaly
cancellation condition for six-dimensional theories requires that Nf = 2Nc at each node
in the quiver. In the brane system, this requirement can be expressed as

nD6,left − nD6,right = n0 = 2πF(0) .

(2.3)

This follows from the Bianchi identity (BI) dF(2) − H(3) F(0) = δD6, integrated around
the D6’s before and after an NS5.

2.2. Susy breaking

At present, all known examples of interacting CFT’s in six dimensions are supersymmetric
and arise from decoupling limits of string constructions. In this section we conjecture a
possible consistent picture for susy breaking of the six-dimensional (1, 0) theories studied
in this paper. We propose a use of susy-breaking anti-branes in the spirit of [22, 24] to
argue in favor of the existence of a new class of non-supersymmetric 6d CFT’s. Our
considerations here are further supported by a detailed study of the dual gravitational
solutions that will be presented in the next section.

The starting point is the brane diagram of the six-dimensional (1, 0) theory in the
tensor branch as presented in ﬁgure 1. In this setup we assume that the D8 branes are
far away and do not play an active role. The NS5’s are separated and look like lines on
the (x5, x6) plane spanned by the D6 branes.

At this pont we would like to review a more familiar situation. In four dimensions in
fact there is a very similar brane system which consists of NS5–D4–D6 branes. There, it

8

Figure 2: The shaded horizontal segments symbolize D6 branes extending between NS5
branes.

is possible to move two NS5 branes across each other. In the process, some D4 branes
are generated in the interval between the two NS5 branes and they annihilate against D4
branes sitting on top of them. This is the brane picture of Seiberg duality, which was
originally proposed in [27] and reinterpreted in [24] using anti-branes.

The idea behind [24] is that of generating a non-zero meson vev in the electric theory
by moving the D4 branes away from their position. In this way, if we perform a Seiberg
duality, the brane system undergoes a net creation of D4 branes which do not annihilate
because the D4 branes are displaced from their original position. This means that the
magnetic theory is non-supersymmetric and its brane system is the string theory repre-
sentation of the ISS vacuum [28]. A ﬁnal important remark is that in type IIA there is
an alternative way of obtaining the same ﬁnal situation; namely by adding D4/D4 pairs
to all the intervals (where the D4 branes are stretched between the NS5’s) except the one
between the two interchanged NS5’s.

In six dimensions things are more complicated and in fact we do not know if there
exists a dynamical process along the line of [24], which could explain the susy breaking.
Even though we do not have such a dynamical description, we propose the following brane
engineering to obtain a ﬁnal non-supersymmetric theory. Starting from the brane system
in ﬁgure 1, we add D6 branes to it while having ﬂuxes jump in the gravity description,
such in a way that the full D6 brane charge (2.3) remains unaﬀected. This mechanism
is depicted in ﬁgure 2. The simple argument behind this statement is that, at the level
of the brane charges, it is simply impossible to distinguish between the original system
and the one in presence of the D6 branes. This can be seen in the following way. First of
all, excluding the presence of D8 branes, it is known that gravity solutions supported by
brane sources must satisy

kD6 − kD6 = N F(0) ,

(2.4)

where kD6 and kD6 are the number of D6 and D6 branes respectively and N is the number
fo NS5’s. The (2.4) may be regarded as a consequence of the BI for F(2). At this point, it
is clear that situations with diﬀerent numbers of D6 and D6 branes can be described in
this way, provided that a jump in the ﬂuxes on the rhs of (2.4) is accordingly taken into
account.

The use of anti-branes to construct non-supersymmetric vacua was pioneered in [22]
and applied in many other contexts by many authors. The hallmark of this approach
is that in order for the new conﬁguration to describe states in the same theory, the

9

supergravity charges at inﬁnity should be unchanged. Notice that this requirement nicely
ﬁts with our proposal for the susy breaking within the 6d (1, 0) theory.

In the conventional language of susy-breaking literature, we just obtained a meta-
stable non-supersymmetric version of the 6d (1, 0) theory in the tensor branch. The meta-
stability here is triggered by the explicit presence of anti-branes in the brane construction
of the gauge theory. It would be nice to have a ﬁeld-theoretic description of this process
even though the absence of a Lagrangian formulation seems to be a great obstacle in this
case.

Even though the use of anti-branes might generically leads to gravitational instabilities,
here one should not be too worried about this stability issue for two reasons. Firstly, the
theory that we are now considering has not quite reached yet a CFT point. Secondly, the
gauge-theoretic meta-stability does not reﬂect an actual instability of the gravity solution
that we are going to describe in the next section. The simultaneous presence of D6 and
D6 branes creates a tension in the system that triggers an annihilation process which is
eventually resolved when the distance between the solitonic NS5 branes tends to zero.
Indeed, we know that this limit is very special because it corresponds to the emergence
of a new interacting conformal ﬁxed point.

Let us summarize our main idea. A non-supersymmetric meta-stable state of a 6d
(1, 0) theory can be resolved in the limit where the distance between the NS5 branes
tends to zero. This is the sign of a new non-supersymmetric 6d conformal ﬁxed point,
which can be reached in the IR through an RG ﬂow. We claim that such a ﬁxed point
exists and that it can be studied in the context of the AdS7/CFT6 correspondence.

2.3. Annihilation of D6’s and D6’s between NS5 branes

We now provide more details about the ﬂow between the two conformal ﬁxed points. As
already anticipated, the process that should lead to a non-supersymmetric ﬁxed point
in the IR involves a move into the tensor branch, where the NS5 branes are separated
along the x6 direction. While separating the NS5’s, the right amount of D6’s and D6’s
is created, such that the charge conservation constraint (2.4) is fulﬁlled. The presence of
D6’s between two NS5 nodes is quite crucial here. Notice that, since the supersymmetric
ﬁxed point in the tensor branch moduli space is unique, whenever reaching a new ﬁxed
point in the IR, it will necessarily be non-supersymmetric.

Let us give a brief description of the RG ﬂow that reaches the new ﬁxed point in the
IR in terms of brane conﬁgurations. This non-supersymmetric ﬂow involves a presence
of branes and anti-branes stretching between the NS5’s. For simplicity we focus on two
NS5’s separated by coincident kD6 and kD6 stretching along the interval in between in the
x6 direction. Some of the 6-branes tend to annihilate pairwise because of the presence of
open-string tachyons [29–31]. Eventually, these tachyons condense and the brane system
decays to a non-supersymmetric ﬁxed point. We claim that this non-trivial eﬀect is due
to the presence of the NS5’s. To illustrate our idea we focus on a D6/D6 pair in an NS5

10

background. As shown in [32–34], this system can be described with a tachyon eﬀective
action of the form

det(ηµν + h(R) ∂µR ∂νR + ∂µτ ∂ντ ) ,

(2.5)

(cid:90)

Sτ = −T6

d7x

(cid:113)

V(τ )(cid:112)h(R)

where τ is a “tachyon” ﬁeld, ηµν is the metric on the NS5 worldvolume theory and R is a
ﬁeld coinciding with the distance between two NS5’s. The dynamics of the center of mass
is decoupled, and h is then given by the harmonic function of the NS5 background

h(R) = 1 +

The total eﬀective potential is given by

V(φ, τ ) =

(cid:112)h(R) cosh

T6

(cid:17) .

(cid:16) τ√

(2.6)

(2.7)

The potential V provides a measure of the interaction between the distance of the NS5
and the tachyon ﬁeld. In an eﬀective ﬁeld theory description this would be indentiﬁed with
a coupling of the theory. When τ → ±∞ and R → 0, V goes to zero and the coupling
disappears.
It is quite remarkable that the limit where the tachyon coupling is weak
coincides with the emergence of the conformal ﬁxed point. We interpret this phenomenon
as a clear indication that the presence of D6 is deeply related to the existence of a new
non-superysmmetric IR ﬁxed point. The mechanism through which the D6’s trigger the
RG ﬂow is sketched in ﬁgure 3.

It would be very interesting to repeat this analysis in a more complicated background.
In particular the brane/anti-brane pair should be studied in a background that incorpo-
rates the eﬀect of original supersymmetric D6 segments separating the NS5’s.

theory. The vertical arrows indicate the evolution of the ﬂow, whereas the horizontal blue
arrows describe the attractive force between NS5 branes driven by tachyon condensation.

3. AdS7 vacua and interpolating solutions

In the previous section we have proposed an intuitive stringy construction giving rise to
a dynamical susy breaking mechanism within an NS5–D6–D8 system. This allowed us to
argue in favor of the existence of non-supersymmetric conformal ﬁxed points in 6d which
are connected to (1, 0) theories via RG ﬂows.

The aim of this section will be that of supporting the above intuition by constructing
its holographic evidence in the context of massive type IIA supergravity. This theory is
known to admit supersymmetric AdS7 vacua thanks to the work of [8] and [10], where
the general supersymmetric IIA system of equations was analyzed using “pure spinor”
techniques.

Subsequently, in [11] it was shown that there exists a consistent truncation of massive
type IIA supergravity on AdS7 × S3 yielding a half-maximal 7d gauged supergravity
restricted to the gravity multiplet as an eﬀective description. This allows us to explicitly

12

construct the 10d lift of all AdS7 solutions found in [12] in the gauged supergravity context.
These will include, in particular, a non-supersymmetric one2. Moreover, exploiting the 7d
eﬀective description, we will be able to compute the full perturbative spectrum of closed
string excitations, which turns out to be tachyon-free even in the non-supersymmetric
solutions.

Finally, we present a static non-BPS DW solution interpolating between the super-
symmetric and non-supersymmetric AdS vacua providing us with the due evidence of the
existence of a 6d RG ﬂow connecting the supersymmetric ﬁxed point in the UV with the
non-supersymmetric one in the IR. We will also construct the corresponding 10d ﬂow.
This will turn out to describe a non-BPS, but extremal NS5–D6–D6 system admitting an
AdS7 × S3 near-horizon geometry.

3.1. The 10d ﬂow Ansatz

In order to study the lift of a non-BPS DW solution, we will cast an explicit 10d Ansatz
for the metric and the forms. In general this Ansatz will be of cohomogeneity 2 (i.e. all
the ﬁelds depend on two coordinates (z, r)). However, we will use a certain specialization
of the Ansatz given in [11], which suitably splits the z & the r dependence. Despite that
such a splitting will not consist in a factorized (z, r)-dependence in the original Ansatz,
it will succeed in converting the original ﬁeld equations into ODE’s.

The Ansatz for the 10d metric reads,

2A hint at the possible existence of interesting non-supersymmetric AdS7 solutions of massive IIA was
ﬁrst given in [35], though their relation to the ones analyzed here remains to be studied in detail and
clariﬁed.

In what follows we will analyze the constraints imposed by the set of ﬁeld equations and
BI in appendix A on our 10d Ansatz of the form of (3.1). For such a case, we will see how
the original set of PDE’s is turned into a set of ODE’s constraining the functions Φ0(r),
A(r), x(r) as well as a(z) & X(z).

3.2. Asymptotic AdS vacuum Solutions

When looking for AdS vacuum solutions, one should further specialize the Ans¨atze in
section 3.1 to constant proﬁles for the scalar X, in order to recover the AdS7 behavior at
z → ±∞. In particular, one sets

X(z) = X ,

a(z) =

where

(cid:96) =

(3.5)

Plugging this into the 10d equations (A.4), (A.5), (A.3) and (A.8) in appendix A, we get
that the full set of 10d ﬁeld equations and BI is equivalent to the following set of ODE’s

together with the following algebraic condition on X:

The ODE’s (3.6) are exactly the same ODE’s found in [8]. Moreover, (3.7) is solved for
the following two values of X 5

(3.8)
where the ﬁrst value corresponds to the supersymmetric solution at z → +∞ and the
second to the non-supersymmetric one at z → −∞.

X 5 = 1 ,

3.2.1. Supersymmetric AdS7 Solutions
The supersymmetric solution that one asymptotes to as z → +∞ is of the type of [8].
All the AdS7 solutions have a ten-dimensional metric which can be written as a warped
product

ds2

10 = e2A(r)ds2

AdS7 + ds2

M3 .

(3.9)

14

Moreover, since (1, 0) theories have an SU(2) R-symmetry, all supersymmetric solutions
of the above type need to have an M3 constructed from a ﬁbration of a round S2 over a
one dimensional space:

ds2

M3 = dr2 +

e2A(r) (1 − x(r)2) dΩ2

(2) ,

1
16

(3.10)

where the function x is related to the volume of the S2 and the dilaton Φ0 is a function
of r only. Notice that the S2 shrinks at the two endpoints of the one dimensional space,
so that M3 has the topology of an S3. It is actually a suspension, i.e. a ﬁbration of an
S2 over an interval in the coordinate r. Locally, supersymmetry turns out to reduce the
10d ﬁeld equations to the system of ODE’s in (3.6).

The NS-NS ﬂux reads

H(3) = −(cid:0)6e−A(r) + F(0) x(r) eΦ0(r)(cid:1) volM3
eA(r)−Φ0(r)(cid:112)1 − x(r)2 (cid:0)F(0) x(r) eA(r)+Φ0(r) − 4(cid:1) volS2

where F(0) is the Romans’ mass, while the R-R two-form ﬂux is given by

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.14)

It was subsequently found in [10] that the solutions are determined by a unique func-

tion β(y) satisfying a single ODE:

It was shown in [10] that(3.13) and (3.14) together are equivalent to the system of ODE’s
(3.6). The global AdS7 solutions of [8] may be rewritten in terms of a unique function [10]
β(y), which is given by

β(y) =

(y − y0) (y + 2y0)2 ,

(3.15)

where y0 = − 3k2
. (3.15) is a particular solution, with D6 branes at one pole, whereas the
other pole is regular. The β’s which resembles D6, D6 branes and O6 planes singularities
are given in [10], and nicely summarized in [36].

(cid:19)2 e3A(y)(cid:112)β(y)

dr =

dy .

(3.16)

As explained in [8] and [9], there are no regular solutions without any D-brane sources.
The only sources that can preserve R-symmetry are D6’s, D6’s or O6’s, at the poles —
and/or D8’s wrapping an S2 at a certain value rD8 of r. When no D8’s are present, it is
possible to have solutions with an arbitrary number kD6 of D6’s at the south pole and kD6
of D6’s at the north pole; these solutions have Romans’ mass F(0) and NS-NS three-form
H(3), restricted by the BI to satisfy

kD6 − kD6 = F(0) N ,

(3.17)

where N is the integrated and properly normalized H-ﬂux integer. The case when F(0) =
0 is just the reduction along the Hopf ﬁber of the famous AdS7 × S4/Zk solution.

Studying the asymptotic behavior for the system (3.6) automatically informs us about
the presence of D6, D6 or O6 sources. For example, if we consider F0 > 0, it follows from
(3.6) that at x = 1 (the north pole) A + Φ can go to either ±∞. For A + Φ → −∞ we
have that

eA(r) ∼ r1/3 ,

eΦ(r) ∼ r ,

x(r) ∼ 1 + r4/3 ,

(3.18)

which is the correct asymptotic behavior for an D6 stack. This exercise can be repeated
also for D6 branes at the south pole or O6 planes at the north pole, where the positivity
of the charges depends on the sign of the function x. At the moment the presence of D6
branes has nothing to do with susy breaking, indeed here we are in curved space and the
Killing spinor conditions are modiﬁed in a way that does not break supersymmetry.

More solutions can be obtained by introducing D8 branes. In this case, the Romans’
mass F(0) jumps because of the presence of the D8’s, and correspondingly the metric is
continuous but has a discontinuous ﬁrst derivative. There is an inﬁnite set of solutions
[8,10], which are conjectured [9] to be in one-to-one correspondence with the NS5–D6–D8
system described in section 2.1.

3.2.2. Non-supersymmetric AdS7 counterparts

The non-supersymmetric solutions are in a way very similar to their supersymmetric
counterparts. The 10d solution in this case is obtained by setting X = 2−1/5 in the
Ansatz (3.1). This gives

(3.23)

where the functions A, Φ0 & x still satisfy the diﬀerential conditions (3.6). Besides some
numerical scaling factors, the behavior at the poles of the non-supersymmetric solutions
are equivalent to the supersymmetric ones, this makes more challenging the interpretation
of the susy braking in terms of brane construction at the conformal point. Moreover, we
can actually see that for each supersymmetric solution there exists a very similar non-
supersymmetric counterpart, even when allowing for jumps of F(0), namely D8 branes
wrapping S2 of the suspension geometry.

3.3. Interpolating 10d ﬂow solution

We now want to abandon the restriction made in (3.5) with the aim of ﬁnding ﬂow
solutions in the z coordinate. By plugging the 10d ﬂow Ansatz into the equations of
motion of massive type IIA given in appendix A, one ﬁnds that they are implied by the
set of ODE’s (3.6), together with the following set of ODE’s

 a(cid:48)(z) = (cid:102)W (X)
(cid:102)W (X)
where the function(cid:102)W is characterized by the condition

17

The equations in (3.24) are ﬁrst-order conditions for the functions a(z) & X(z) which,
therefore, determine an extremal ﬂow. Such a ﬂow solution must correspond to the metric
of a non-BPS NS5–D6–D6 brane system. The near-horizon limit thereof can be studied
by performing a coordinate rediﬁnition that non-trivially mixes z & r, in analogy with the
BPS case [37]. What is reasonable to expect here in the near-horizon limit is the emergence
of a non-BPS NS5 brane. This would be in line with [31], where non-BPS (p − 1) branes
were proven to eﬀectively describe a Dp–Dp system upon tachyon condesation, this would
be consistent with our proposal in section 2.3.

3.4. 7d eﬀective description

In the previous part of this section we have presented 10d AdS7 solutions which are the
candidate gravity duals of a class of interesting novel 6d CFT’s.
In order to be able
to holographically derive a few relevant features of the aforementioned CFT’s, it turns
out to be particularly useful to embed the gravity solution within half-maximal gauged
supergravities in d = 7.

The theory in its “minimal” incarnation, i.e.

restricted to the gravity multiplet,
only contains one scalar ﬁeld and still already captures the essential features of both the
supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric AdS solutions. However, this can be regarded
as a truncation of a larger theory containing three vector multiplets and the link to this
will be essential in order to capture the full information concerning the spectrum of type
IIA closed string excitations. We refer to appendix B for the details of these gauged
supergravity theories and their embedding tensor formulations.

3.4.1. AdS vacua and interpolating DW solution
In appendix B we argue that massive type IIA backgrounds of the form AdS7 × S3 can
be studied within the ISO(3)-gauged supergravity theory in d = 7 parametrized by the
embedding tensor in table 5. In order to study maximally symmetric vacuum solutions,
we just need to analyze the critical points of the eﬀective scalar potential (B.6) speciﬁed
to this case. Furthermore, supersymmetry preserving vacuum solutions can be in this
case easily identiﬁed by evaluating the gradient of the superpotential (B.8) at the critical
point and checking whether it vanishes.

The scalar potential for the relevant truncation (B.13) then reads

V(AdS7×S3) =

(3.26)

where the constants θ, q & ˜q are respectively related to NS-NS ﬂux, S3 curvature and
Romans’ mass, according to the dictionary in table 5. Moreover, the scalar φ in (3.26) is
exactly related to X appearing in section 3 through X ≡ e
φ√
10 , and it should not to be
confused with the scalar in the tensor multiplet of section 2. The above scalar potential

10 (3q − ˜q) .

(3.27)

By minimizing the scalar potential (3.26), we ﬁnd three types of critical points which
are collected in table 1. This set turns out to be included in the exhaustive classiﬁcation
carried out by [12] by using the so-called “going-to-the-origin” (GTTO) approach [38].
In this particular case, there appear three inequivalent AdS critical points, one of which
is supersymmetric (hence stable), whereas out of the other two non-supersymmetric ones
only one appears to be perturbatively stable.

non-supersymmetric. Sol. 2 even violates the BF in (3.29), thus being unstable.

We just remind the reader that such vacua will be given by the extrema P0 of the
potential, while the perturbative stability of the corresponding solutions can be checked
by computing the eigenvalues of the following mass matrix

(cid:0)m2(cid:1)I

J ≡ K IK ∂K∂J V |P0

,

(3.28)

K IJ being the components of the inverse kinetic metric. In the case of an AdS extremum,
each of the eigenvalues of (3.28) normalized to the cosmological constant is required to
be above the so-called Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound [39] in order for it to be
perturbatively stable. Such a critical value for arbitrary d is given by

m2
|Λ|

!≥ − d − 1
2 (d − 2)

,

19

(3.29)

which equals − 3

5 in 7d.

Due to our holographic purposes, we can from now on, disregard Sol. 2 since it contains
an instability. By taking a closer look at it, one realizes that it has a negative sign of the
F(0)H(3) tadpole, as opposed to the other solutions. This signals the presence of exceeding
D6 branes which might explain the arising tachyon.

Focusing on Sol. 1 & 3, they may be viewed as two diﬀerent extrema of the same
scalar potential by choosing 4 θ = q = ˜q = λ. The supersymmetric extremum has been
found [9] to provide the gravity dual of a 6d (1, 0) theory, whereas the non-supersymmetric
one provide a concrete evidence for the existence of a non-supersymmetric 6d CFT.

A crucial part of our argument is based on the existence of an interpolating static DW
solution connecting the two AdS vacua. This solution was originally found in [14] and we
will review it here. Not only, will it give holographic evidence for an RG ﬂow between
the (1, 0) and this novel theory, but it will furthermore allow us to argue in favor of the
non-perturbative stability of the non-supersymmetric AdS extremum, thus rendering our
statement much more robust.

Since the aforementioned critical points only diﬀer by the position of the R+ scalar
φ, the interpolating DW solution can be found within the truncation (B.13) obtained by
only retaining the ﬁeld content of the gravity mutiplet, i.e. the metric, the two-form and
φ. By then casting the following Ansatz

where (cid:48) denotes a derivative w.r.t. the z coordinate. The interpolating solution that we
are looking for describes the ﬂow between a supersymmetric and a non-supersymmetric
critical point and therefore, it is non-BPS. However, by making use of the Hamilton-Jacobi
(HJ) formalism, one can rewrite the above second-order problem as the following system

of ﬁrst-order ﬂow equations [14](cid:40) a(cid:48) = 1

Note that the above condition deﬁnes the HJ generating function(cid:102)W as a fake superpoten-

tial. Although such a function is in general nothing to do with supersymmetry, the (3.33)
always admits the actual superpotential (B.8) as a solution. Moreover, when choosing

supersymmetric DW.

Interestingly, in our case the (3.33) happens to have two inequivalent global solutions,
the ﬁrst one being the actual superpotential and the second one being a fake superpotential
which can only be determined numerically. The corresponding function is plotted in
ﬁgure 4. This allows one to solve the ﬂow equations in (3.32). The z proﬁle of the DW is
shown in ﬁgure 5.

In the previous section we presented a DW solution interpolating between the supersym-
metric and non-supersymmetric AdS vacua which suggested the existence of an RG ﬂow
between a 6d (1, 0) theory in the UV and a novel local 6d CFT in the IR.

The aim of this section is to examine all the properties of the theory at the IR ﬁxed
point by means of holographic techniques. This analysis includes a calculation of the
conformal anomaly and a validity check of the “a-theorem” throughout the ﬂow. We
observe that both tests give interesting results about the novel CFT6. Moreover, we
calculate the spectrum of conformal dimensions at both ﬁxed points. Together with the
previous analysis, this gives a further evidence about the existence of an interacting CFT6
in the IR.

4.1. Conformal anomaly

In general, there is a deep intuition that computing the conformal anomaly for a CFT
is a way to measure its degrees of freedom. In this way, it is very important to test this
quantity also in our 6d CFT in order to understand what the expected properties of the
theory are. The universal trace anomaly in even spacetime dimensions d was computed
holographically in the seminal paper [40], this yields

(cid:104)T µ

µ(cid:105)d =

(cid:96)d−1
GN

a(d) ,

(4.1)

where a(d) denotes a suitable polynomial containing degree d/2 curvature invariants in
the components of the Riemann tensor. In particular, the explicit general form of the
aforementioned anomaly polynomial implies a = c for all CFT’s admitting a holographic
dual. In order to infer the correct behavior of the a coeﬃcient, we follow the procedure
outlined in [9, 41], consisting in computing the following integral

(cid:90)

F =

e5A−2Φ vol3 .

(4.2)

It can be easily seen that the resulting N 3 behavior of the free energy obtained in [9] for
the supersymmetric case will still hold in the non-supersymmetric setting analyzed here.
The intuitive reason for this is that the above integral only diﬀers by certain numerical
factors related to powers of the scalar X 3. Furthermore, this novel example of conformal
ﬁxed point gives us the opportumity of testing the validity of an a-theorem within a
non-supersymmetric context in 6d, i.e.

3The ratio of the free energies for the susy and non-susy solution is

Fsusy

Fnon−susy

= X 20.

aUV > aIR .

23

The above statement is known to hold for SCFT6’s [42], although a general proof outside
of the supersymmetric case is still lacking. To verify this in our case, we use (4.1) to
conclude that

where, in the last step, we have used that ∂φ(cid:102)W = 0 at both ends of the ﬂow. By taking a

look at ﬁgure 4, this implies that c decreases monotonically along the ﬂow conﬁrming the
expectation from the a-theorem. Notice that this analysis is equivalent to that of [15],
provided that we identify the central charge function as c(z) ∼ (Tzz)

− 5
2 .

4.2. Operator spectrum

The upshot of the previous section is that our novel CFT6 has a positive conformal
anomaly and seems to satisfy our “na¨ıve” expectations from the a-theorem. Now, given
that we are describing this theory as a new ﬁxed point associated to an RG ﬂow, it is
interesting to compute the operator spectrum of the theory both at the supersymmetric
(UV) and non-supersymmetric (IR) point and to understand which operator is responsible
for triggering the ﬂow.

We can address this problem in the framework of the eﬀective 7d description of gauged
supergravity as introduced in appendix B. The masses associated with the AdS7 states
both in the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric case are the following:4

SUSY :

NON-SUSY : m2

i (cid:96)2 = {0 (×3), −8,
m2
i (cid:96)2 = {0 (×8),

12,

16 (×5),
36}

40} ,

.

(4.4)

At this point, we can use a very well known formula which relates the value of the
supergravity masses to the conformal dimension of the operators in the dual CFT. Namely,
in 6d we have

∆i (∆i − 6) = m2

i (cid:96)2 ,

(4.5)

where ∆i denotes the conformal dimension of the operator Oi in the dual CFT.

Thanks to (4.5), we can construct the spectrum of operators at a given conformal ﬁxed
point. Moreover, it turns out to be possible to keep track of the conformal dimensions of all
operators throughout the whole ﬂow. This can be done holographically by exploiting the
information encoded within the scalar sector of the 7d eﬀective supergravity introduced
in appenidx B.

The DW solution connecting our AdS vacua preserves a residual SO(3) symmetry. In
particular, in the supersymmetric extremum, such a symmetry can be interpreted as the
SU(2)R R-symmetry group of the dual (1, 0) SCFT. Notice that the non-supersymmetric

extremum will also share the same residual symmetry, this is interpreted as a global
symmetry of the new theory and it is no longer related to R-symmetry in any way. This
implies that the scalar mass spectrum of both solutions be organized into SO(3) irrep’s.5

Notice that the spectra in (4.4) are indeed organized into the expected irrep’s of SO(3).
Furthermore, by combining (4.5) with the analysis of the eigenvectors of the mass matrix
at the critical points, the evolution of the operator spectrum along the RG ﬂow can be
obtained unambiguously. The corresponding results are collected in table 2.

at both ends of the RG ﬂow, i.e.
the supersymmetric one in the UV and the non-
supersymmetric one in the IR. ϕi indicates the set of scalars of the 7d Supergravity.

The physical interpretation of the operators appearing in table 2 is the following. Due
to the fact that the DW solution discussed here may be found within the truncation
(B.13), the only scalar assuming a dynamical proﬁle is φ. As a consequence, the only
operator acquiring a vev during the ﬂow must correspond with the ﬁrst singlet in table 2
and hence it is the one responsible for triggering the RG ﬂow in the CFT. This operator
has dimension 4, i.e.
it is a relevant operator in 6d and it is interpreted as a mass
deformation. As one can easily see, the remaining operators listed above are irrelevant or
at most marginal and as such, do not play any role in this context.

Let us denote by OX the operator of dimension 4. The analytical expression of its
conformal dimension ∆X may be determined all along the ﬂow by computing the mass of
the dual canonically normalized scalar ﬁeld φ. This reads

where the label “unphys.” denotes all irrep’s corresponding to compact SL(4, R) generators, which do
not correspond to physical scalars in that they can be gauged away.

25

where(cid:102)W (φ) is the fake superpotential plotted in ﬁgure 4. Note that the above quantity

stays meaningful throughout the ﬂow since φ is an eigendirection of the mass matrix and
does not mix to any other scalars. Finally, by using (4.5), we computed the corresponding
conformal dimension ∆X and found that it has a monotonic behavior starting from 4 in
the UV and ending up at 3 +

21 in the IR.

√

Our choice suggests a correspondence with the dual scalar X(z) responsible for the
interpolating solution in supergravity.
In section 2.3 we proposed a stringy picture of
the RG ﬂow. The presence of anti-branes hints to a move in the tensor branch that cul-
minates in a new non-supersymmetric ﬁxed point. As explained, in the limit where the
distance between NS5 branes goes to zero the tachyons do not couple with any ﬁelds in
the resulting theory. This occurrence can be also sketched within a 6d eﬀective action
description.
Indeed, because of symmetry arguments we can single out the following 6d eﬀective La-
grangian 6

Leﬀ = φ Tr(F 2) + (∂φ)2 + φOX + ... ,

(4.7)

where the remaining terms are not important for the current discussion. The coupling
φOX is invariant under SU(2)R and matches the description with the potential introduced
in section 2.3. In order to get rid of the above coupling we need to go at the point φ = 0,
i.e at the collision of the NS5’s. However, notice that in such a limit the eﬀective action
approach loses its meaning and we see the emergence of a conformal ﬁxed point. Another
possibility is that OX ∼ φ2 and the term in the eﬀective action triggering the ﬂow along
the tensor branch is a mass term of the form: mφ2. Because of the evidence coming from
the holographic solution, we conclude that, in our setup, the susy breaking deformation
involves a coupling with the tensor multiplet scalar.

It is worth mentioning that the appearence of operators in the IR with non-integer
conformal dimensions should not be regarded as surprising but rather as a signal of an
“interesting” interacting theory. The reason for this goes as follows. Any free CFT
admits a Lagrangian description. If that is the case the conformal dimensions of primary
operators are integers or semi-integers. In this way the OPE can only be trivial because all
the 3-point functions are trivial, it follows that a free CFT cannot have “new” operators
with non-(semi)integers dimensions.

Moreover, such a situation should be generically expected whenever considering non-
supersymmetric ﬂows where all operators remain unprotected and tend to develop non-
vanishing anomalous dimensions.
In this sense, the dual eﬀective gauged supergravity
approach turns out to be rather fruitful because it gives us an opportunity to compute
such anomalous dimensions exactly.

6Here and in what follows in the rest of this section, φ denotes again the scalar of the tensor multiplet.

5. Stability checks and evidence for anti-branes susy breaking in 6d theories

In this section we perform some checks regarding various stability issues of the gravita-
tional solutions in order to provide further conﬁrmation to our holographic picture.

Before moving to the stability analysis of the non-supersymmetric vacuum at a non-
perturbative level, let us ﬁrst add an important remark concerning its perturbative sta-
bility. Within the context of the eﬀective 7d supergravity theory coupled to 3 vector
multiplets, we have essentially computed the mass spectrum of the closed string zero
modes. Despite that, one may still worry about the size of perturbative corrections both
in α(cid:48) and gs. However, the eﬀective gauged supergravity action turns out to be loop-exact.
Moreover, for what concerns higher derivative eﬀects, they are generically suppressed ow-
ing to the large size of the internal S3 when expressed in string units.

5.1. Non-perturbative stability

In order to support our holographic evidence of non-supersymmetric 6d CFT’s, we address
here the issue of non-perturbative stability of Sol. 3 in table 1. Generically, perturbatively
stable AdS critical points are not protected from quantum tunneling eﬀects that might
result in a decay towards the true vacuum of the theory. Such an eﬀect may occur through
spontaneous bubble nucleation processes (see for example [43,44]) which are described by
gravitational instanton solutions.

In [45, 46] the above situation was considered within a theory of gravity, where the
true and false vacuum, respectively characterized by Λ1 < Λ2, are separated by a DW.
Gravitational instantons where found to provide a ﬁnite contribution to the Euclidean
action provided that the following condition be satisﬁed

(cid:16)(cid:112)|Λ1| − (cid:112)|Λ2|(cid:17)

τDW <

2√
3

,

(5.1)

where τDW denotes the tension of the separating wall.

In our case, the supersymmetric and the non-supersymmetric AdS vacua are separated
by a static extremal DW, which then happens to saturate the CDL bound [47]. This may
be already regarded as a sign of a decay channel that does not yield any ﬁnite contribution
to the Euclidean action. Contrary to static DW, any other time dependent interpolating
solution will necessarily give rise to a ﬁnite contribution to the Euclidean action thus
resulting in a non-perturbative instability.

Supersymmetric critical points have been proven not to be aﬀected by such decay
processes [48, 49] due to the existence of positive energy theorems, whereas the issue
might become very subtle when it comes to non-supersymmetric solutions. However,
in [50] a generalization of the above positive energy theorems was developed and a concrete

27

criterion for stability was established. This issue will be addressed more in detail and in a
more general context in a forthcoming paper [51] where, in summary, the existence of an
interpolating static domain wall turns out to be a necessary condition for non-perturbative
stability.

Adopting this strategy in our case, the above criterion boils down to checking the

existence of a suitable function f (φ) such that

f(cid:48)(φ) = 0 ,
Vf (φ) ≤ V (φ) ,

at both extrema ,
∀ φ ∈ decay path ,

(5.2)

10 f 2 and V (φ) is given in (3.26). The fake superpotential (cid:102)W

where Vf ≡ 1
plotted in ﬁgure 4 deﬁning the extremal ﬂow (3.32) happens to saturate the above in-
equality thus proving a positive energy theorem for the non-supersymmetric AdS vacuum.
This implies the stability of the ﬁxed non-susy AdS point.

5.2. Presence of anti-branes: a physical argument

As we already mentioned the non-supersymmetric AdS7 solutions of section 3.2.2 are very
similar to the supersymmetric one found in [8,10] and summarized in section 3.2.1, namely
they have analogous boundary behaviors close to the poles of the S3. However, something
happens in the interior of the S3, and the geometry of the susy solutions gets deformed,
namely the proﬁles of ﬁelds in the non-supersymmetric solutions are a bit diﬀerent from
the susy ones.

In section 3, we conjectured that a 6d susy breaking is realized by inserting the same
amount of D6 and D6 between two NS5’s when the theory is resolved in its tensor branch
(i.e. all the NS5’s are separated in the x6 direction, or at least partially). As explained
in section 2.3, the brane system is then unstable and it decays to a point in moduli space
where the NS5 branes are all coincident, i.e. to a conformal point or to a holographic AdS7
vacuum when taking the near-horizon limit. The susy-breaking D6’s are now annihilated
in the vacuum and therefore we do not observe any signiﬁcant change at the poles in the
branes charges.

However, we can still study the ratio of the tensions of our AdS7 solutions, comparing

it with the following quantity

TD6 + TD6
TD6, susy sol.

,

(5.3)

where TD6, susy sol. is the tension of the D6 branes at the poles in a supersymmetric AdS
solution, whereas TD6 + TD6 is the sum of the tension of D6 branes and D6 branes7. In
general we have that for a bound state of branes

TD6 + TD6 ≥ TD6+D6 ≥ Tnon−susy sol. ,

(5.4)

7Similar analysis about the tension of D6/D6 systems appeared in [52].

28

where Tnon−susy sol. is the tension of the branes at the poles of a non-supersymmetric
solution, when everything is already annihilated and tachyons condensed. We now have
the following inequality

TD6 + TD6
TD6, susy sol.

≥ Tnon−susy sol.
TD6, susy sol.

(5.5)

where we used the time-time component of the Einstein tensor (i.e. |Rtt − 1
2gtt R| ) to
estimate the tension at both AdS7 points. By plugging all the quantities in (3.16) and
(3.14), we can extract the leading order coeﬃcient in two variables (z, y), which in terms
of the constant X is

T ∼

X

(−1 + 8X 5(1 + X 5))

.

(5.6)

For the susy case, we computed TD6, susy sol. by plugging in (5.6) X = 1, and Tnon−susy sol.

by plugging in (5.6) X 5 = 1

2, which lead to

Tnon−susy sol.
TD6, susy sol.

=

3
2

=⇒ TD6 + TD6
TD6, susy sol.

≥ 3

.

(5.7)

First of all, the fact that the tension of the non-supersymmetric solution is bigger than
the supersymmetric one reﬂect the fact that somehow in the non-supersymmetric vacuum
there should be a remnant of some extra brane sources.

We can now give a bound on the number of branes and anti-branes we need to add
in order to reach a non-supersymmetric AdS point. The tension can be written as TD6 ∼
k|QD6|. Moreover charge conservation at the poles implies the following constraint

TD6, susy sol. ∼ (kD6 − kD6) QD6 .

We then get a new inequality,

(5.8)

(5.9)

kD6 + kD6
kD6 − kD6

≥ 3
2

,

(cid:20)kD6

(cid:21)

5

kD6 ≥

which can be expressed as a lower bound for the number of D6

.

(5.10)

We have given here an evidence for the presence of D6’s during the non-supersymmetric
DW interpolating ﬂow between the two AdS7 vacua. The D6/D6 system, that we con-
jecture to give a holographic non-supersymmetric AdS7 vacuum in the IR. This picture,
indeed, seems to be consistent with an estimation of the ratio for the tension of the two
AdS solutions. Finally, it would be interesting to understand better this bound on the
number of D6’s. This bound might be due to the eﬀect of the supersymmetric D6’s stretch-
ing between the two NS5’s as gravitational background for the tachyon condensation given
in section 2.3.

6. Conclusions

In this paper we conjectured the existence of a class of novel six-dimensional and non-
supersymmetric conformal ﬁeld theories. These theories are strongly interacting ﬁxed
points obtained by means of a non-supersymmetric RG ﬂow.

We have been able to identify the RG ﬂow as an interpolating DW solution of gauged
supergravity. The DW connects two AdS7 vacua, a supersymmetric one in the UV and
a non-supersymmetric one in the IR. A careful analysis of the supergravity spectrum has
been carried out in order to exclude the presence of tachyons in the non-supersymmetric
AdS7 vacua. Using holography, we also calculated the conformal dimensions spectrum
of dual theories at both ﬁxed points. The outcome of this calculation is that there is
only one operator acquiring a vev during the ﬂow, which has dimension 4, i.e. a relevant
operator in 6d. It is responsible for triggering an RG ﬂow between dual CFT’s.

As already mentioned, all the solutions of 7d gauged supergravity used in this paper
have a known string theory lift. Here we proposed a susy-breaking mechanism at the
level of massive IIA brane constructions for 6d (1, 0) theories. We created a meta-stable
non-supersymmetric gauge theory in the tensor branch by means of D6 branes and we
explained how the conﬁguration reaches a stable conformal ﬁxed point in the IR. In
particular we outlined a mechanism relating the presence of D6 branes to a holographic
RG ﬂow and we gave some indications about the fate of the open string tachyons along
the ﬂow.

The possibility of a non-supersymmetric 6d CFT is quite attractive also from a ﬁeld
theoretical point of view. At the moment, many properties of six-dimensional conformal
ﬁeld theories outside the supersymmetric case are unknown. We attempted to clarify some
features of this new example. More precisely, we computed the holographic anomaly and
we tested the validity of the “a-theorem” along the ﬂow in terms of the gravitational stress
energy tensor. Both tests conﬁrm general expectations about 6d CFT’s. Of course, much
more studies still have to be done to understand this example and we hope that our work
is useful in exploring further properties of 6d CFT’s.

Finally, we would like to mention some possible generalizations of our analysis. We
believe that some features of this work can be extended to other dimensions, as this
could deepen the understanding of non-supersymmetric RG ﬂows in gauged supergravity
and their relationship with AdS/CFT. It would also be very interesting to investigate the
possibility of new analytic non-supersymmetric solutions as well as interpolating solutions
of massive IIA.

The fruitful interaction between anti-branes in AdS and dual CFT observed in this
paper is quite remarkable. The emergence of a conformal ﬁxed point resolves in a natural
way a number of problematic stability issues. It would be really fascinating to understand

30

if conformal ﬁeld theory ﬁxed points might play a role also in the stabilization of uplifting
anti-branes used in model building scenarios.

From a ﬁeld theoretical point of view, more work should be done to assess the validity
of our susy-breaking mechanism. The absence of a Lagrangian description makes things
more complicated and we are not completely certain about the legitimacy of an eﬀective
action analysis in this context. A problem that should be immediately addressed concerns
the operators’ couplings in the eﬀective theory. For instance, there should be a symmetry
argument that prevents the coupling of the open string tachyon to other ﬁelds in the IR
theory as indicated by our stringy construction. In addition, it would be useful to classify
all the deformations of a 6d CFT that might lead to the kind of IR ﬁxed point described
here. This analysis could also reveal potential further examples of non-supersymmetric
CFT6.

Appendix B: Half-maximal gauged 7d supergravities

In this appendix we introduce half-maximal gauged 7d supergravities. To this end, we will
make use of the so-called embedding tensor formalism. This tool will allow us to identify
a class of deformations which can be shown to correspond with eﬀective 7d theories de-
scribing the truncation of massive type IIA supergravity on S3. By focusing on these, we
will then review their vacuum solutions. There are only two distinct and perturbatively
stable AdS vacua, a supersymmetric and a non-supersymmetric one, which holographi-
cally correspond to a supersymmetric and a non-supersymmetric conformal ﬁxed point,
respectively.

Half-maximal supergravity in D = 7 coupled to three vector multiplets can be obtained
by compactifying type I supergravity on a T3. The theory possesses 16 supercharges
which can be rearranged into a pair of symplectic-Majorana (SM) spinors transforming
as a doublet of SU(2)R. The full Lagrangian enjoys the following global symmetry

G0 = R+

φ × SO(3, 3) ≈ R+

φ × SL(4, R) .

(B.1)

The (64B + 64F ) bosonic and fermionic propagating degrees of freedom (dof’s) of the
theory are then rearranged into irrep’s of G0 as described in table 3.

B.0.1. Relation to massive type IIA compactiﬁcations

In this subsection we will discuss which part of the deformations in (B.4) can be
obtained upon reducing massive type IIA supergravity on AdS7 × S3. In order to derive
the embedding tensor/ﬂuxes dictionary for this speciﬁc case we will make use of group-
theoretical arguments along the lines of [55].

This compactiﬁcations is generically supported by D6 branes and O6 planes and, as
a consequence, it requires a Z2 truncation to the orientifold-even sector, thus resulting in
an eﬀective 7d description only retaining 16 supercharges. As a ﬁrst check, we will now
show how the even components of the IIA bosonic ﬁelds ﬁll the 7d degrees of freedom
given in table 3. The resulting ﬁeld content is listed in table 4.

Table 4: The eﬀective 7d bosonic ﬁeld content of type IIA supergravity on a compact 3d
manifold. Please note that the orientifold truncation selects the ﬁeld components which
are even w.r.t. a combination of the fermionic number, the worldsheet parity and O6
involution. After dualizing the 3-form into a 2-form, the counting exactly matches the
bosonic part of the 7d ﬁeld content given in table 3.

We introduce the universal moduli (ρ, τ ) [56] through the following 10d Ansatz in the

string frame

µν dxµ ⊗ dxν + ρ2 Mij dxi ⊗ dxj ,
where Mij parametrizes the SL(3, R)/SO(3) coset and the condition

In order to identify the embedding tensor deformations turned on by the type IIA ﬂuxes
on the AdS7 × S3 background, we need to decompose the objects in (B.4) w.r.t.

the resulting embedding tensor/ﬂuxes dictionary being given in table 5.

By subsequently plugging the mapping in table 5 into the constraints given in (B.5),
one ﬁnds that no condition needs to be imposed for consistency. This implies that our
massive type IIA backgrounds can be eﬀectively described by a theory with sixteen su-
percharges. Moreover, one more interesting check consists in working out the extra con-
straints required in order to have an uplift to maximal supergravity in this case. What
one ﬁnds is F(0) H(3) = 0, which is in perfect agreement with the prediction that maximal
supersymmetry should not allow for any D6 branes or O6 planes.

appendix by performing the following truncation to the gravity sector:

By specifying (B.6) & (B.8) to the case in (B.13), one recovers the scalar potential and
the superpotential given in (3.26) & (3.27), respectively.
