ABSTRACT. A modiﬁed version of the Hardy-Littlewood tauberian theorem is used to prove under
which conditions the moduli of the coefﬁcients |a (n )|/n of schlicht functions tend uniformly to
their Hayman-indexes as n → ∞.

orem, full mapping, asymptotic Bieberbach Conjecture

In the sequel let N0 = N ∪ {0}, let D denote the unit disk, let ∆ = {z ∈ C : |z| > 1} and let S,Σ
tion of the classΣ see for instance [1]). Suppose that f ∈ S is given by f (z ) =P∞

denote the set of schlicht functions and the set of the full mappings respectively(for a deﬁni-
n =0 a n z n and let
0 ≤ α ≤ 1 denote its Hayman-index. The Hayman-index α of a schlicht function f ∈ S is deﬁned
by the formula α = (1− r )2M∞(r, f ), where M∞(r, f ) = max{|f (z )| : |z| = r}. f ∈ S is said to be of
slow growth if α = 0 and it is said to be of maximal growth if α > 0. Then Hayman’s regularity
theorem asserts that |a n|/n → α as n → ∞, however by a result of Shirokov([2]) (|a n|/n ) may
converge arbitrarily slowly to α as n → ∞. So the question arises under which conditions the
terms |a n|/n converge more regularly to α as n → ∞. In order to give an answer to this ques-
tion families of schlicht functions with certain properties will be considered in the sequel and

the tool mainly used will be an extension of the Hardy-Littlewood tauberian theorem, which

is introduced in Lemma 1. It’s proof will be given here since the author wasn’t aware of any

reference.

The next result is usually proved as part of the Helly-Selection-Theorem(see for instance [4],

Chapter 7), it will be used several times in the sequel and formulated as a lemma here.

Lemma 2. Let (g n ), g n : [0, 1] → R be a sequence of uniformly bounded functions such that each
g n is continuous and non-increasing in [0, 1] and suppose that there exists a function g : [0, 1] →
R such that g n (r ) → g (r ) as n → ∞ for every r ∈ [0, 1]. Then g : [0, 1] → R is non-increasing and
g (r ). If moreover g : [0, 1] → R is continuous in [0, 1] then (g n ) converges
lim sup
n→∞
uniformly in [0, 1] to g as n → ∞.

g n (1) ≤ lim
r→1−

In order to introduce the ﬁrst theorem consider the sequence (f m ), f m (z ) = r −1
m k (rm z ) where
k denotes the Koebe-function and (rm ),m ∈ N denotes a sequence such that 0 < rm < 1 and
rm → 1 as m → ∞. Then each f m of the sequence has Hayman-index 0, yet the sequence (f m )
converges locally uniformly in D to the limit-function k which has Hayman-index 1. There-
fore, by Hayman’s regularity theorem on the one hand |a n (f m )|/n → 0 as n → ∞ for each f m ,
but on the other hand |a n (f m )|/n → 1 as m → ∞ because the sequence (f m ) converges locally
uniformly in D to the Koebe-function. So, if the seqence (f m ), f m ∈ S converges locally uni-
formly in D to a schlicht function f as m → ∞, the convergence of the Hayman-indexes α(f m )

of f m ∈ S to the Hayman-index α(f ) of the limit-function f ∈ S seems to be an essential hy-
pothesis in order to establish the simultaneous convergence |a n (f m )|/n → α(f m ) as m , n → ∞.
The ﬁrst theorem assumes that this minimal hypothesis is fulﬁlled.

Theorem 1. Let (f m ), f m ∈ S, m ∈ N be given by f m (z ) =P∞

(i) (f m ) converges locally uniformly in D to a schlicht function f as m → ∞
(ii) αm → α as m → ∞ where αm and α denote the Hayman-indexes of f m and f respectively
Then there exists a constant N (ε) only dependent on ε such that

Proof. Let ε > 0 be chosen arbitrarily and consider the case α > 0 ﬁrst. Without loss in gen-
erality suppose that for each m ∈ N f m ∈ S has Hayman-index αm > 0 and radius of great-
est growth in the direction of the positive real axis. For m ∈ N and 0 < r < 1 deﬁne h m by

increasing in [0, 1]([1],chapter 5.5), and by (ii) the limit function Re h : [0, 1] → R deﬁned by
Re{h(r )} = log((1−r )2r −1|f (r )|) is continuous in [0, 1]. Hence by Lemma 2 the sequence (Re h m )

r −1(1 − r )2M∞(r, f ). Then each of the functions g , g m : [0, 1] → R is non-increasing and non-
negative([1], chapter 5.5 Lemma). Moreover they are continuous in [0, 1] and g m (r ) → g (r ) as
m → ∞ for every r ∈ [0, 1]. In order to prove that g m , m ∈ N and g are continuous in [0, 1] let
0 < r0 < 1 be chosen arbitrarily and observe that by the maximum-modulus principle there is a
number r0exp (i θ ), θ ∈ [0, 2π) such that f (r0exp (i θ ) = M∞(r0, f ). Then there exists a δ(r0) such
that

0 ≤ g (r0)− g (r ) ≤ r −1

0 (1− r0)2(cid:12)(cid:12) fr0exp (i θ )(cid:12)(cid:12)− r −1(1− r )2(cid:12)(cid:12)fr exp (i θ )(cid:12)(cid:12) < ε

whenever 0 < r − r0 < δ(r0). This proves that g (r ) → g (r0) as r → r0+, the case g (r ) → g (r0)
as r → r0− can be proved similarly. The continuity of the functions g ,g m at r 0 = 0 and r 0 = 1
however, is obvious and the proof that each g m , m ∈ N is continuous is along the same lines.
In order to show that g m (r ) → g (r ) as m → ∞ if r ∈ [0, 1] observe that this holds for r = 1 and
r = 0 because of hypothesis (ii) and since for every m ∈ N g m (0) = g (0) = 1. So let r ∈ (0, 1) and
suppose on the contrary that g m (r ) 9 g (r ) as m → ∞ for some r ∈ [0, 1]. Then there exists a
subsequence (g m (k )(r )) and a β ∈ [0, 1] such that
(16)

lim
k→∞

g m (k )(r ) = β 6= g (r ).

However the subsequence can be chosen in such a way that M∞(r, f m (k )) = |f m (k )(z m (k ))| where
z m (k ) → z as k → ∞ for some z , z m (k ) with |z| ≤ r , |z m (k )| ≤ r for k ∈ N, and such that (16)
holds. But, because of the uniform convergence of the sequence (f m ) in |z| ≤ r , there exists a
N1(ε) ∈ N such that

if k > N1(ε). Let w , |w| ≤ r be a point such that |f (w )| = M∞(r, f ). Then, since (f m ) converges
uniformly in |z| ≤ r as m → ∞ there exists a N2(ε) ∈ N such that
(18)

(19)

if k > N2(ε). Therefore (17), (18) and the fact, that f and f m (k ), k ∈ N take on their maxima if
|z| ≤ r at z = w and z = z m , m ∈ N respectively, yield

whenever k > max{N1(ε), N2(ε)}. Now (18) and (19 ) imply that

0 ≤ M∞(r, f m (k ))−(cid:12)(cid:12)f m (k )(w )(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ M∞(r, f m (k ))−(cid:12)(cid:12)f m (k )(w )(cid:12)(cid:12) + M∞(r, f )−(cid:12)(cid:12) f (z )(cid:12)(cid:12) <

if k > max{N1(ε), N2(ε)} which proves that g m (k )(r ) → g (r ) as k → ∞, a contradiction to (16).
So g m (r ) → g (r ) as m → ∞ if r ∈ [0, 1] and an appeal to Lemma 2 shows that g m → g uniformly
on [0, 1] as m → ∞. But by Prawitz’ theorem(see the proof of the lemma in [1],chapter 5.7)

function that maximizes the modulus of the n -th coefﬁcient then Theorem 1 reveals that in or-

der to prove the asymptotic Bieberbach conjecture(now superseded by de Branges theorem)

it only has to be shown that for any subsequence (f n (k )) of (f n ) that converges locally uni-
formly in D to some schlicht function f the Hayman-indexes α(f n (k )) of f n (k ) ∈ S converge
to the Hayman-index α(f ) of f ∈ S as k → ∞(for more details about the asymptotic Bieberbach
conjecture see [1], chapter 2.12).

Here is another example how Theorem 1 can be used to obtain structural information.

Example 2. (Zalcman Conjecture) Deﬁne functionals Fn , n ∈ N for f ∈ S by Fn (f ) = |a n (f )2 −
a 2n−1(f )|. Then Zalcman’s conjecture asserts that Fn (f ) ≤ (n − 1)2 for f ∈ S. Suppose that f n ,
n ∈ N maximizes Fn within the class of schlicht functions and that there were a subsequence
(f n (k )) that converges to a schlicht function of slow growth. Then the sequence (f n (k )) satisiﬁes
hypothesis (ii) of Theorem 1(by Lemma 2) and consequently (n (k ) − 1)−2Fn (k )(f n (k )) → 0 as
k → ∞ by Theorem 1, a contradiction. This argument shows that large classes of coefﬁcient
functionals, or rather their extremal functions have no accumulation points of slow growth.

The next lemma will be used in the proof of Theorem 2, however it is of interest in itself, since

it provides an extension of an earlier result of Basilewitsch([5]) concerning the case of equality

in his theorem.

Lemma 3. Let f ∈ S have Hayman-index α > 0 and suppose that g ∈Σ where g (z ) = f (z −1)−1 if

|z| > 1, that is g is a full mapping. Furthermore let γn , n ∈ N denote the logarithmic coefﬁcients
of f ∈ S and let exp (i θ ), θ ∈ [0, 2π) denote the direction of greatest growth of f ∈ S. Then

Proof. In order to prove the lemma it obviously sufﬁces to consider the case that f ∈ S is not a
rotation of the Koebe-function. Let γk n , k , n ∈ N denote the logarithmic Grunsky-coefﬁcients

of g ∈Σ and choose the vectors (λ1, λ2, .., λn ), n ∈ N as (λ1, λ2, .., λn ) = (z , z 2, .., z n ). Then the

strong Grunsky inequalities([1], chapter 4.3), assert that

(23)

=

1
n |z|2n < log(1−|z|2)

(24)

since g ∈Σ. Now suppose that there were a z 0 ∈ D such that
for some β > 0 and let N ∈ N be chosen large enough such that log(1−|z 0|2 −PN

= log(1−|z 0|2)

β . Then by (23) and (24)

EBERHARD MICHEL

Now, with the extended version of Basilewitsch’s theorem at hand, it is possible to formulate

and prove a theorem which extends the results of Theorem 1 to the case that the limit-function
f ∈ S of the sequence (f m ), f m ∈ S is of maximal growth.

Theorem 2. Let (f m ), f m ∈ S, m ∈ N be given by f m (z ) =P∞

(i) (f m ) converges locally uniformly in D to a schlicht function f of maximal growth as m → ∞
(ii) αm → α as m → ∞ where αm , α denote the Hayman-indexes of f m and f respectively
(iii) the functions g , g m : ∆ → C, m ∈ N deﬁned by g (z ) = 1/f (z −1) and g m (z ) = 1/f m (z −1)

n z n and suppose that

n =1 a (m )

Then for every ε > 0 there exist a constant N (ε) only dependent on ε such that

respectively, are full mappings, that is g , g m ∈Σ
n − αm(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

whenever m , n > N (ε).

n |

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

|a

(m )

< ε

Proof. Let 0 < ε < α be given arbitrarily. Since the limit-function f ∈ S was supposed to be of
maximal growth, by (ii) there exists a constant N1(ε) ∈ N such that
(31)

0 < α− ε < αm < α + ε

n =1 γ(m )

n =1 n|γ(m )

n z n and g (z ) = log{z −1 f (z )} = 2P∞

uniformly in D as k → ∞. Now let h(z ) =P∞

real axis. For m ∈ N deﬁne h m : D → C by h m (z ) =P∞
g m (z ) = log{z −1 f m (z )} = 2P∞

whenever m > N1(ε). Hence, without loss in generality, it may be supposed, that each f m ,
m ∈ N has Hayman-index αm > 0 and radius of greatest growth in the direction of the positive
n − n−1|2z n and g , g m : D → C by
n =1 γn z n respectively.
Here γ(m )
n , n ∈ N and γn , n ∈ N denote the logarithmic coefﬁcients of f m ∈ S and f ∈ S respec-
tively. Then, by the initial hypothesis of the proof, that each f m , m ∈ N has Hayman-index
αm > 0, and by Basilewitsch’s theorem the family {h m} is locally bounded in D, hence there
exists a subsequence (h m (k )) and an analytic function h : D → C such that h m (k ) → h locally
k =1 βk z k , consider an arbitrarily chosen coefﬁ-
cient βν ,ν ∈ N and observe that by hypothesis (i) g m → g locally uniformly in D as m → ∞
and hence γ(m )
ν − ν−1|2 → ν|γν − ν−1|2 as m → ∞ and
consequently βν = ν|γν −ν−1|2 for every ν ∈ N since h m (k ) → h locally uniformly in D as k → ∞.
Because the subsequence (h m (k )) was chosen arbitrarily each subsequence (h m (k )) of the se-
quence (h m ) converges locally uniformly to h as k → ∞ and by a result of Montel([6], Theo-
rem 2.4.2) the whole sequence (h m ) converges to the limit-function h locally uniformly in D
as m → ∞. By Lemma 3 and Abel’s limit theorem then also h m (1) = −(1/2)logαm for m ∈ N
and h(1) = −(1/2)logα and consequently by hypothesis (ii) and Lemma 2 h m → h uniformly
on [0, 1] as m → ∞. But now Lemma 1 applied to the functions h m implies that there exists a
N2(ε) ∈ N such that

ν → γν as m → ∞. Therefore also ν|γ(m )

converges uniformly on [0, 1] to |F| as m → ∞ because of hypothesis (ii) and Lemma 2. Hence,
since |F| is continuous on [0, 1], there exists a N3(ε) ∈ N and a ρ > 0 such that

Theorems 1 and 2 may be considered as an extension of Hayman’s regularity theorem to fam-

ilies of schlicht functions. So in spite of Shirokov’s discouraging result remarkably sharp re-

sults concerning the uniform convergence of the coefﬁcients of convergent families of schlicht

functions can be obtained. Loosely spoken the uniformity of the growth of convergent fam-

ilies of schlicht functions in their direction of maximal growth(hypothesis (ii) of theorems 1

and 2) determines the uniformity of the convergence of their coefﬁcients. However there is an-

other interesting aspect if the approximation results of Theorem 2 are compared with number-

theoretic approximation theorems, in particular the Thue-Siegel-Roth theorem. In both cases

appropriate subclasses - the algebraic numbers in the number-theoretic case and the schlicht

functions

that

generate

full-mappings

in the

function-theoretic

case

- have

stronger approximation properties than the whole classes(see LeVeque’s extension of Roth’s

theorem given in [8]). This allows to deduce theorems that describe the algebraic solutions of

diophantine equations in the number-theoretic case and it allows to deduce structural theo-

rems concerning extremal problems with respect to the class of schlicht functions in the other

case. However the approximation properties are of interest in themselves.
