The transverse momentum spectra at RHIC and LHC for A+A and p+p
collisions are studied with Tsallis distributions in diﬀerent approaches i.e.
with and without radial ﬂow. The information on the freeze-out surface in
terms of freeze-out volume, temperature, chemical potential and radial ﬂow
velocities for diﬀerent particle species are obtained. These parameters are
found to show a systematic behavior with mass dependence. It is observed
that the heavier particles freeze-out early as compared to lighter particles
and freeze-out surfaces are diﬀerent for diﬀerent particles, which is a direct
signature of mass dependent diﬀerential freeze-out. Further, we observe
that the radial ﬂow velocity decreases with increasing mass. This conﬁrms
the mass ordering behavior in collectivity observed in heavy-ion collisions.
It is also observed that the systems created in peripheral heavy-ion collisions
and in proton-proton collisions are of similar thermodynamic nature.

1. Introduction

The particles produced in heavy-ion collisions carry information about
the collision dynamics and evolution of the system. Therefore, the study
of particle’s invariant transverse momentum (pT ) spectra is an important
tool to understand the system dynamics. Tsallis non-extensive statistics is
commonly used to analyze the pT -spectra in hadronic and nuclear collisions

4. Results and Discussion

√

The analysis of pT spectra around mid rapidity is performed at

sN N =
200 GeV and 2.76 TeV using Eqs.1, 2 and 3 for A+A and p+p collisions. It
is well known that the number of binary collisions increase with number of
participants. So the system created in central collisions reaches equilibrium
quickly as compared to peripheral collisions. Hence, one uses non-extensive
statistics while describing the thermodynamics of peripheral collisions.

Firstly, Eq. 2 is used to study the invariant pT spectra of identiﬁed par-
ticles, as shown in Fig. 1. It is found that the volume parameter decreases
and the freeze-out temperature increases with increase in particle mass,
leading to a diﬀerential freeze-out scenario. The q-parameter is found to be
decreasing with mass for all the cases.

Secondly, similar procedure is followed using Eq. 1 for most central and
sN N = 200 GeV. Similar mass dependent
peripheral Au+Au collisions at
behavior is depicted in Fig 2. The freeze out radius parameter (R) is not
necessarily the HBT radius and also µ is not necessarily the chemical po-
tential of a particle. The extracted parameters T and µ (Eq.1) are related
by [1], T = T0 + (q− 1)µ, where T = T0 for µ = 0. The parameters obtained
from Eqns. 1 (i.e. T, µ and q) and 2 (i.e. T ≡ T0) satisfy this relation.

Following same procedure by using Eq. 3, a similar mass dependency
is observed as shown in Fig 2. This decrease in q value may hint that the
non-extensivity is shared by system dynamics. Here the extra parameter
radial ﬂow (v) is observed to decrease with particle mass. This goes inline
with hydrodynamic description of the evolution of a ﬁreball created in high-
energy collisions. In summary, the above observations indicate a diﬀerential
freeze-out scenario at RHIC and LHC energies. Details of the analysis could
be found in Ref.[1].
