ABSTRACT

Two extrapolation models of the solar coronal magnetic ﬁeld are compared

using magnetogram data from the SDO/HMI instrument. The two models, a

horizontal current–current sheet–source surface (HCCSSS) model and a potential

ﬁeld–source surface (PFSS) model diﬀer in their treatment of coronal currents.

Each model has its own critical variable, respectively the radius of a cusp surface

and a source surface, and it is found that adjusting these heights over the period

studied allows better ﬁt between the models and the solar open ﬂux at 1 AU as

calculated from the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF). The HCCSSS model

provides the better ﬁt for the overall period from 2010 November to 2015 May

as well as for two subsets of the period — the minimum/rising part of the solar

cycle, and the recently-identiﬁed peak in the IMF from mid-2014 to mid-2015

just after solar maximum. It is found that a HCCSSS cusp surface height of 1.7

R(cid:12) provides the best ﬁt to the IMF for the overall period, while 1.7 & 1.9 R(cid:12)

give the best ﬁts for the two subsets. The corresponding values for the PFSS

source surface height are 2.1, 2.2 and 2.0 R(cid:12) respectively. This means that the

HCCSSS cusp surface rises as the solar cycle progresses while the PFSS source

surface falls.

INTRODUCTION

Modeling solar coronal open ﬂux is one of the tools available to solar physics in the

search for understanding of the behavior of the corona. This is important, in turn, because

of the corona’s inﬂuence on space weather and the magnetosphere of the Earth.

One class of these models involves extrapolation of coronal magnetic ﬁeld and the

interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (IMF) from the photospheric magnetogram. Early models

achieved good results with simple, current-free models (Schatten et al. 1969); later

versions include the eﬀects of coronal currents (Hoeksema et al. 1983). At present, the

Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)

provides magnetograms at a high cadence, but photospheric magnetic data has been

available for many years, beginning with the work of Hale (1908) and continuing through

the full-disk magnetograms of Babcock (1963) in the 1950s & 60s to current instrumentation

such as HMI. Coronal models made use of this data as early as the 1960s (Schatten et al.

1969), and an improved form of these models (the Wang-Sheeley-Arge, or WSA model

(Arge & Pizzo 2000)) is currently used by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center

(SWPC) in forecasting the magnetospheric eﬀects of solar activity.

Since these early developments, increases in computing power have enabled more

sophisticated modeling of the corona through magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approaches.

Extrapolation models give comparable results (Riley 2006) and can be quickly and easily

implemented with small-scale computing resources. Extrapolation models lend themselves

to computing the long-term, relatively smooth quasi-static magnetic ﬁeld at the corona.

This paper compares two such extrapolation models, a potential ﬁeld–source surface

(PFSS) model developed at the Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory

(LMSAL) (Schrijver & DeRosa 2003) and a horizontal current–current sheet–source surface

(HCCSSS) model developed at Stanford University (Zhao & Hoeksema 1994, 1995). Solar

– 4 –

open magnetic ﬂux calculated by the models is compared to open ﬂux derived from the

Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) using a technique proposed by Lockwood (2002). It

builds on earlier work by the authors (Arden et al. 2014; Arden & Norton 2015).

In this paper we examine HMI data for the period from 2010 November 26 to 2015

May 21, which encompasses the rising phase of solar cycle 24 and also the dramatic increase

in solar mean ﬁeld and open ﬂux observed by Sheeley & Wang (2015) starting in mid-2014.

As those authors point out, this type of rise has characterized the declining phase of at

least the last three solar cycles. This is particularly interesting since it has been shown that

open ﬂux during the declining phase is a reliable precursor of the activity in the next solar

cycle (Feynman 1982).

The paper begins with an outline of the data and analytical methods used. It continues

with descriptions of the two models and the method of calculating open ﬂux at 1 AU.

The performance of the two models is compared and the results are discussed in the ﬁnal

sections of the paper.

2. DATA & METHODOLOGY

Coronal extrapolation models such as these begin with measured magnetic ﬁeld

data from photospheric observations. Field lines originating at the photosphere are

mathematically extrapolated upwards to the corona and beyond, to an imaginary source

surface outside of which all ﬁeld lines are forced to be open and radial. Both models used in

this paper follow this general approach, with diﬀerences described in detail in sections 2.2

and 2.4. Table 1 presents an abbreviated comparison of the two models.

A test of the accuracy of these models is comparison to the open ﬂux at Earth, 1 AU

from the Sun. The interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld at Earth provides an in situ measurement

– 5 –

of open ﬂux; the IMF is measured by spacecraft such as ACE and made publicly available

in NASA’s OMNI 2 database.

2.1. Magnetograms — the Photospheric Field

The SDO/HMI instrument produces full-disk, line-of-sight magnetic images

with a cadence of 45 seconds from the front camera and 12 minutes from the side

camera. The 12-minute images are used from this study (HMI.M-720s data series,

http://jsoc.stanford.edu/jsocwiki/hmi.M-720s-info). Even a full-disk image,

however, only covers the Earth-facing half of the photosphere; accurate calculation of total

open ﬂux requires information about the entire photosphere. Therefore, a set of sequential

images over a solar revolution is typically combined to form a synoptic map of the entire

Sun. While these images do not represent the Sun at any one time (the earliest data

incorporated into the synoptic map is approximately 27 days older than the latest data),

they are suﬃcient as input for the quasi-static models discussed here.

In addition to the time-dependence of the measurements, the diﬃculty of measuring

the magnetic ﬁeld at large line-of-sight projection angles is well known (Petrie 2012). These

large angles occur at high solar latitudes, which makes them critical for accurate modeling;

the unipolar magnetic regions at high latitudes comprise the polar caps where much of

the high-speed solar wind originates. Sun et al. (2011) discuss the diﬃculties, and some

possible solutions, to this problem.

Both of the models tested here are fundamentally based on spherical harmonic

integration and thus require some estimate of the surface magnetic ﬁeld over the entire

photosphere. The two models use diﬀerent methods to arrive at the magnetic ﬁelds at high

latitudes (which are diﬃcult to measure accurately). The LMSAL/SSW PFSS model uses

– 6 –

a ﬂux-dispersal model to estimate the polar magnetic ﬁeld (Schrijver & DeRosa 2003).

The HCCSSS model incorporates polar ﬁeld observations in fall & spring (when the solar

tilt angle is favorable) and estimates the values at other times through spatial-temporal

interpolation (Sun et al. 2011).

This work uses synoptic maps from LMSAL as input to the PFSS model. These are

publicly available at http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/archive/ssw/pfss_links_v2/.

Synoptic maps used as input for the HCCSSS model were obtained from Stanford University

(Sun et al. 2011).

2.2. Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model

Using the solar magnetic ﬁeld measured at the photosphere as the lower boundary

condition for a coronal model is well established. Beginning with early work by

Altschuler & Newkirk (1969) and Schatten et al. (1969) and continuing through

work by Schrijver & DeRosa (2003) and many others, these models have reached

a level of sophistication that enables them to be used for near-real time space

weather prediction by the NOAA SWPC (Arge & Pizzo 2000) (see, for example,

http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/wsa-enlil-solar-wind-prediction). Mackay &

Yeates (2012) provide an overview of many of these models.

The corona is known to carry electric currents, but these currents are generally

not signiﬁcant on the global scale except near the heliospheric current sheet. The lower

boundary condition for the model is the photospheric ﬁeld derived from magnetograms

(with radius equal to that of the Sun, R(cid:12)). This ﬁeld depends on radial distance as well

as solar latitude and longitude (R(cid:12) = B(r, θ, φ)). An imaginary sphere called the source

surface at radius Rss, where the magnetic ﬁeld is assumed to be purely radial (Rss = B(r)),

– 7 –

provides the upper boundary condition. As its name implies, the PFSS technique does not

consider coronal currents below the source surface. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the PFSS

model.

Under these constraints, ∇ × B = 0 and B = −∇Ψ, where Ψ is a scalar potential (see

Mackay & Yeates (2012)). Ψ satisﬁes Laplace’s equation:

This equation is solved using spherical harmonic methods to give the components of
B(r, θ, φ) at any point over the range Rs ≤ r ≤ Rss.

The PFSS model used in the present study was developed at LMSAL. It uses

the SolarSoft (IDL) software package and assimilates surface-ﬂux estimates along with

MDI and HMI magnetogram data. This model is currently in its second revision

(http://www.lmsal.com/forecast/).

The output of a PFSS model includes values of the radial B ﬁeld (Br, in nT) over a

grid at the source surface. Total open ﬂux is obtained by integrating the absolute values

of the radial ﬁeld over the sphere and then dividing by two (simply integrating the B ﬁeld

would result in zero net ﬂux). In actual computation, this integration is half the sum of the

absolute values weighted by the area of the respective grid elements.

Synoptic magnetograms of the photosphere at a cadence of one per day are used as

input to the PFSS model. The output is a daily ﬁle of B ﬁeld as described above.

– 8 –

2.3. Varying the PFSS source surface for better ﬁt

The source surface height Rss is commonly taken to be 2.5 R(cid:12) (Hoeksema et al. 1983).

In fact, though, this is a free parameter in the PFSS model. Varying the height of the

source surface over the course of the solar cycle has been explored by Lee et al. (2011) and

Arden et al. (2014). Adjusting Rss is one way to better match the open ﬂux measured at 1

AU. After examination of source surface heights ranging in value from 1.5 to 2.5 R(cid:12), the

values chosen for this study are 2.0 and 2.25 R(cid:12) for diﬀerent phases of the solar cycle.

The connection between source surface height and open ﬂux is this: Smaller spatial-

scale magnetic loops that close lower in the atmosphere are represented by the higher

spherical harmonic orders. Loops that close beneath the source surface (and therefore do

not penetrate it) do not contribute to the open ﬂux above the source surface. As the source

surface height is raised, therefore, fewer of the higher order loops penetrate the source

surface and open ﬂux decreases. As source surface height is lowered, more of these higher

spatial-order loops cross the source surface and open ﬂux increases.

In Arden et al. (2014), it was shown that moving the source surface to higher values

in the PFSS model gives a better ﬁt as the solar cycle passed from maximum to minimum.

The results of the current study support that conclusion (see 4).

2.4. Horizontal Current – Current Sheet – Source Surface (HCCSSS) model

The HCCSSS model takes a diﬀerent approach to modeling the corona. This model

begins with the assumption of a corona in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium with horizontal

electric currents instead of a potential ﬁeld, and adds a cusp surface to model the eﬀect of

streamer current sheets (Zhao & Hoeksema 1994, 1995). This model, unlike PFSS, is not

force-free due to the inclusion of pressure and gravity. Finally, the HCCSSS model adds a

– 9 –

source surface to include volume currents beyond the cusp surface. The resulting model

gets its name from the inclusion of horizontal currents, current sheet, and a source surface.

Note that in Zhao & Hoeksema (1995), this model is called CSSS; the name HCCSSS is

more descriptive and will be used here.

As described by Zhao & Hoeksema, helmet-streamer structures such as those observed

in solar eclipses indicate that coronal currents alter the magnetic topology. A streamer

interface starts near the cusp-shaped neutral point over a closed region. Coronal currents

are assumed to have two components: horizontal volume currents in the corona and sheet

currents ﬂowing within streamer interfaces. All helmet-streamer components are assumed

to have identical heights (r = Rcp, the “cusp height”). The corona is then divided into two

regions separated by a spherical surface located at Rcp, called the “cusp surface.” Magnetic

ﬁeld lines are assumed to be closed below the cusp surface and open (but not necessarily

radial) above it. The outer region is bounded by a “source surface” corresponding to the

similarly named surface of the PFSS model, at which the magnetic ﬁeld lines are both open

and radial. Figure 2 depicts the HCCSSS model. See Table 1 for a comparison of the PFSS

and HCCSSS models.

The HCCSSS model (Zhao & Hoeksema 1994) begins with the equation for

magnetohydrostatic force balance in 1/r2 gravity (Bogdan & Low 1986):

where B is the magnetic ﬁeld, p the plasma pressure and ρ the plasma density. Bogdan

Solutions for each of the two regions are formulated, with the constraint that all three

components of the magnetic ﬁeld be continuous across the cusp surface. Further details can

be found in Zhao & Hoeksema (1994). In actual computation, only a and Rcp, along with

the observed photospheric magnetic ﬁeld, are required to calculate the magnetic ﬁeld above

the photosphere. In this paper, the value of a is chosen to be 0.2, as described in Zhao

& Hoeksema (1995). It is below this height that the horizontal currents primarily ﬂow.

The model is relatively insensitive to the choice of Rss, the source surface height (which

corresponds to the base of the heliosphere); values of 10-15 are tested in this research with

little diﬀerence in the ﬁnal results for open ﬂux. In accordance with Zhao & Hoeksema

(2010), a value of 15 R(cid:12) was chosen. Cusp surface heights of 1.5, 1.7, 2.0 and 2.2 R(cid:12) were

explored.

In its present form, the HCCSSS model takes as input synoptic maps of the photosphere

at a cadence of one Carrington Rotation (CR). The output is thus an average of open ﬂux

– 11 –

over that CR.

In a similar technique to that employed in the PFSS model, the open ﬂux calculated

by the HCCSSS model can be adjusted by moving the cusp surface higher (which decreases

open ﬂux) or lower (which increases open ﬂux).

2.5. Open Flux at 1 AU — IMF at Earth

Thanks to the work of Lockwood (2013) and others, there is a direct way to arrive at

an estimate of open magnetic ﬂux at 1 AU. It is based on values of Br, which are available

from the OMNI 2 database (http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/ow.html). This database

was created in 2003 and contains in situ solar wind magnetic ﬁeld and plasma data from

a number of near-Earth spacecraft at a one-hour cadence. It includes IMF data from 1963

November through the present; all three components of the ﬁeld (Bx, By and Bz) are given,

in units of nT. We take Bx, the magnetic ﬁeld component along the Sun-Earth line, to

be equal to the radial ﬁeld, and use data from 2010 November through 2015 May. Daily

averages, which are also found in the OMNI 2 database, are used in our calculations and

then averaged by Carrington Rotation to correspond to the output of the HCCSSS model.

The radial component of the heliospheric magnetic ﬁeld has been shown to be

independent of heliospheric latitude; this was deduced from measurements by the Ulysses

spacecraft (Smith & Balogh 1995; Smith 2008, 2011). Based on this assumption, the total

unsigned ﬂux passing through a sphere with a radius of 1 AU (R1) can be given simply by

F = 4πR2

1|Br|/2

(9)

as shown by Lockwood (2002). Note that the factor of two is required, for the following

reason. If the total open ﬂux over a sphere at 1 AU is calculated from the IMF measured

at Earth, all the ﬂux over the whole sphere will be presumed to be of that sign. Taking

– 12 –

the absolute value of Br removes the sign of the polarity, but eﬀectively makes all the ﬂux

positive. The net open ﬂux must be zero, so division by two is required since both the

positive and negative ﬂux would otherwise be counted as positive — resulting in a value

that is twice the actual one. In the paper, we chose to call this ﬂux “unsigned” since it

represents the ﬂux of both polarities.

2.6. Comparing IMF to Modeled Open Flux

We compare the calculated IMF at 1 AU with the results of the PFSS and HCCSSS

models over the time period from 2010 November 26 through 2015 May 21, which

corresponds to Carrington Rotations (CR) 2104–2163. As described earlier, the HCCSSS

model is currently based on synoptic maps of one CR. The PFSS and IMF data are

therefore binned by CR by averaging daily values over corresponding periods. Goodness

of ﬁt is determined by calculating the RMS value of the diﬀerence between the open ﬂux

derived from the IMF and each model over all the CRs in the period.

In addition to comparing the IMF to the models over the entire period, comparisons

are made for two epochs within the period. From the beginning of 2010 through mid-2014,

the Sun appeared to be experiencing a typical, if low activity, cycle. In mid-2014, however,

there was a dramatic rise in the magnitude of the Sun’s large-scale magnetic ﬁeld due to

a signiﬁcant increase in the Sun’s dipole moment (Sheeley & Wang 2015). While Sheeley

& Wang point out that this pattern has occured after solar maximum in each of the three

previous solar cycles, it is not as widely known as other aspects of the solar cycle; it does

not appear in common measures of solar activity such as sunspot count, for example.

During this period, the strength of the IMF radial component doubled; that increase is

readily apparent in our data, and it seemed appropriate to break our tests of the models

into two parts — one for the relatively calm period from late 2010 through mid-2014, and

– 13 –

one for the rise (and subsequent fall) of the IMF from mid-2014 to mid-2015.

3. RESULTS

Figure 3 shows unsigned open ﬂux computed from the IMF compared to the outputs of

the HCCSSS and PFSS models, each at two diﬀerent cusp surface or source surface heights.

In these plots, the average value of the IMF-based or modeled open ﬂux is plotted using

one point per CR for visual comparison. At a cursory glance, both models track at least

the gross features of the IMF when averaged at one CR, including the 2014-2015 peak in

the IMF. The HCCSSS model with a cusp surface height of 1.7R(cid:12) appears to follow the

IMF better from the beginning of the period up to the middle of 2014 (when the IMF rose

dramatically) but then overestimates the open ﬂux during the IMF peak. The PFSS model

gives varying results; a source surface height of 2.2 R(cid:12) gives a closer visual ﬁt over the

earlier part of the period, but 2.0 R(cid:12) appears closer in the later part (the peak of cycle 24).

For a more quantitative measure, we calculate the diﬀerence between the modeled

open ﬂux and the IMF open ﬂux, one CR at a time, and then compute the RMS value of

the collective diﬀerences. These values are shown in Table 2 for three diﬀerent subsets of

the data — the entire period from 2010 November 26 to 2015 May 21 (CR 2104–2163), the

quasi-steady state period from 2010 November 26 to 2014 July 24 (CR 2104–2152) and the

period of the IMF’s surge from 2014 July 25 to 2015 May 21 (CR 2153–2163).

The results in Table 2 can be summarized as follows:

• Overall, a cusp surface height of 1.7R(cid:12) in the HCCSSS model gives the best ﬁt of
either model for the entire period under study. Setting the source surface height to

2.1R(cid:12) in the PFSS model gives the best ﬁt for that model, but the ﬁt is not as good

as that achieved with the HCCSSS model.

– 14 –

• For the relatively uneventful ﬁrst epoch, CR 2104–2152, the HCCSSS model with
a cusp surface height of 1.7R(cid:12) again gives a better ﬁt than any of the three PFSS

source surface heights. The best PFSS source surface height is 2.2R(cid:12).

• During the peak in the IMF, CR 2153–2163, the HCCSSS model with a 1.7R(cid:12) cusp
surface height overestimates the IMF open ﬂux; raising the cusp surface height to

1.9R(cid:12) lowers the model’s open ﬂux and provides a better ﬁt. On the other hand, the

PFSS model underestimates the IMF open ﬂux; lowering the source surface height

from 2.2R(cid:12) to 2.0R(cid:12) raises the model’s open ﬂux to more closely match the IMF

open ﬂux.

Figure 4 illustrates the variation in optimal cusp surface and source surface heights.

Here, interpolated values of the cusp surface and source surface heights that give the best

ﬁt to the IMF open ﬂux are shown for each CR. Reference values of 1.7 R(cid:12) and 1.9 R(cid:12) are

shown for the HCCSSS model as well as values of 2.0 R(cid:12) and 2.2 R(cid:12) for the PFSS model,

in their corresponding epochs. OMNI data from 2014 July shows a drop in IMF open ﬂux

just before the striking increase which resulted in the to-date solar cycle 24 maximum

IMF value of 5.2x1022 Mx in 2014 November. The ﬁrst and second epochs are divided

so that 2014 July is included in the ﬁrst epoch (CR 2104-2152) because the IMF did not

reach values higher than average until 2014 August. For the HCCSSS model (upper plot,

ﬁgure 4), the overall mean cusp surface height of the interpolated values is 1.7 R(cid:12). For the

ﬁrst epoch, the mean height is also 1.7 R(cid:12) while for the second epoch it is 1.9 R(cid:12). The

corresponding mean source surface heights for the PFSS model (lower plot, ﬁgure 4) are

2.1, 2.2 and 2.0 respectively. All of these values are represented in table 2.

4. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS

The ideal coronal extrapolation model would allow initial speciﬁcation of parameters

such as source surface height or cusp surface height, and would then reproduce coronal

behavior precisely as the photospheric inputs change. Attempts to develop such a model

lead to open questions as well as open ﬂux — What are the optimum heights of the cusp

surface and source surface, and when should they be changed? Why does a model work

well under some circumstances but need modiﬁcation in others? The recent work of Sheeley

& Wang (2015) describing an unexpected rise in the IMF in late 2014 provides us the

opportunity to study these models in both quasi-steady state and widely varying situations.

We ﬁnd that both of the models require modiﬁcation of a primary variable in order to track

the IMF accurately in both the rising phase (2010 – 2014) and the post-maximum IMF

peak; cusp surface height in the case of the HCCSSS model, and source surface height for

the PFSS model.

Over the course of the period studied, the mean value of the CR-averaged IMF was

2.9x1022 Mx. Table 2 includes the percent error (100% x RMS diﬀerence / mean IMF) for

the values of cusp surface and source surface. It is clear that the HCCSSS model gives at

least a slightly better, and in some cases signiﬁcantly better, ﬁt than the PFSS model in all

cases; the smallest errors for the entire period, the rising phase of cycle 24, and the IMF

peak in the declining phase all result from the use of the HCCSSS model. Both models,

however, are capable of errors of 20% or less with appropriate tuning of source surface /

cusp surface heights.

The results of this study can be compared to the conclusions of an earlier article by the

authors (Arden et al. 2014). In that work, it was found that a higher PFSS source surface

during solar minimum resulted in a better ﬁt to open ﬂux at 1 AU as calculated from the IMF.

The source surface was lowered as maximum approached, which improved the ﬁt. The NOAA

– 16 –

SWPC estimates that the current solar cycle began in early 2009 and reached its peak in the

ﬁrst half of 2014 (http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/solar-cycle-progression).

The current study begins in 2010, soon after minimum, and we ﬁnd that a higher source

surface value does, indeed, give a better ﬁt for the ﬁrst part of the study (2010 November

– 2014 July) — the minimum and rising phases of cycle 24. Lowering the source surface

improves the ﬁt during the period from 2014 July to 2015 May — the period of solar

maximum and the peak in the IMF, and the end of this study.

We ﬁnd that the opposite is true for the HCCSSS model, whose critical parameter

is the height of the cusp surface and which introduces a more sophisticated treatment of

coronal currents. It is similar to the PFSS model in that raising the cusp surface lowers

calculated open ﬂux. Since the model overestimates the open ﬂux during the IMF peak,

therefore, raising the cusp surface as maximum approached yields a better ﬁt to the IMF

open ﬂux.

The choice of epochs notwithstanding, examination of Figure 3 reveals that the

starting HCCSSS cusp surface of 1.7R(cid:12) provides a better ﬁt for a longer time (2010 to

mid-2014) than the starting PFSS source surface height of 2.25R(cid:12), which begins to deviate

signiﬁcantly from the IMF open ﬂux in mid-2013 — as maximum approaches. In other

words, the time at which the source surface needs to be lowered (mid-2013) is distinctly

diﬀerent from the time that the cusp surface needs to be raised (mid-2014).

This paper examines the eﬀect of changing HCCSSS cusp surface and PFSS source

surface heights. With regard to the HCCSSS model in particular, it is expected that all

three free parameters of the model (the variable a, cusp surface height and source surface

height) probably vary over the solar cycle, and this variation could signiﬁcantly aﬀect the

calculated results. It is appropriate to continue this study to ﬁnd the optimum values of all

three parameters. Also, while there is no physical surface against which the PFSS source

– 17 –

surface height can be tested, validation of the average HCCSSS cusp surface height reported

here by comparison to the cusp height of streamers as observed in coronagraph data could

be a proﬁtable avenue for future exploration.

We have focused here on the behavior of two models and demonstrated that critical

parameters in each model must be adjusted to ﬁt the IMF at Earth. We have not addressed

the reasons why these adjustments are necessary. We believe that the answer lies largely

in the phenomena that aﬀect the solar magnetic ﬁeld on its way from the Sun to 1 AU,

includng coronal mass ejections (CME) (Owens & Crooker 2006; Owens et al. 2011;

Schwadron et al. 2010). These phenomena are not modeled by either technique — nor, for

that matter, by any method based on extrapolation of the photospheric magnetic ﬁeld.

While the authors believe that eﬀects of most of these transient eﬀects are averaged out

over time periods on the order of one CR, this remains very much an area for further

research and discussion.

Allowing the parameters of a model to change over the course of the solar cycle enables

us to more closely model the IMF open ﬂux in retrospect, but at the cost of ﬁnding a single

value that could be used predictively in ﬁelds such as space weather forecasting. The search

continues for a model which captures the most signiﬁcant aspects of the corona’s complex

and dynamic behavior without needing to adjust surface heights or other variables.

Fig. 1.— Diagrammatic representation of PFSS model. The PFSS model assumes a “source

surface” at which all magnetic ﬁeld lines are open and radial. Moving the PFSS source surface

to a lower height increases the open ﬂux because it forces more higher-order structures to

become open.

Fig. 2.— Diagrammatic representation HCCSSS model. The HCCSSS model includes a

“cusp surface,” explained in the text. Moving this cusp surface in or out aﬀects the open

ﬂux calculated by this model.
