Abstract

Workers in insect societies are sometimes observed to kill male eggs of other

workers, a phenomenon known as worker policing. We perform a mathemat-

ical analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of policing. We investigate the

selective forces behind policing for both dominant and recessive mutations

for diﬀerent numbers of matings of the queen. The traditional, relatedness-

based argument suggests that policing evolves if the queen mates with more

than two males, but does not evolve if the queen mates with a single male.

We derive precise conditions for the invasion and stability of policing alle-

les. We ﬁnd that the relatedness-based argument is not robust with respect

to small changes in colony eﬃciency caused by policing. We also calculate

evolutionarily singular strategies and determine when they are evolutionarily

stable. We use a population genetics approach that applies to dominant or

recessive mutations of any eﬀect size.

1. Introduction

In populations with haplodiploid genetics, unfertilized female workers are

capable of laying male eggs. Thus, in a haplodiploid colony, male eggs can

in principle originate from the queen or from the workers. Worker policing

is a phenomenon where female workers kill the male eggs of unmated fe-

male workers (Ratnieks, 1988; Ratnieks and Visscher, 1989; Ratnieks et al.,

2006; Gadagkar, 2001; Wenseleers and Ratnieks, 2006a). Worker policing is

observed in many social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps. Yet the

precise conditions for the evolution of worker policing are still unclear.

Worker policing (Ratnieks, 1988; Ratnieks et al., 2006; Gadagkar, 2001;

Wenseleers and Ratnieks, 2006a) and worker sterility (Wilson, 1971; Hamil-

ton, 1972; Olejarz et al., 2015) are two distinct phenomena that are widespread

in the eusocial Hymenoptera.

In addition to worker policing, a subset of

workers in a colony may forego their own reproductive potential to aid in

raising their siblings. Prior relatedness-based arguments have suggested that

2

queen monogamy is important for the evolution of a non-reproductive worker

caste (Hughes et al., 2008; Cornwallis et al., 2010; Queller and Strassmann,

1998; Foster et al., 2006; Boomsma, 2007, 2009). In contrast, it is believed

that polygamy—not monogamy—is important for the evolution of police

workers.

Several papers have studied the evolution of policing. Starr (1984) ex-

plores various topics in the reproductive biology and sociobiology of eusocial

Hymenoptera. He deﬁnes promiscuity as 1/((cid:80)n

i=1 f 2

i ), where n is the number

of matings of each queen, and fi is the fractional contribution to daughters

by the i-th male mate. He writes, regarding workers, that “They are on av-

erage less related to nephews than brothers whenever [promiscuity is greater

than two] and should prefer that the queen lay all the male eggs. Work-

ers would therefore be expected to interfere with each others’ reproduction.”

Thus, Starr (1984) was the ﬁrst to suggest that workers should raise their

nephews (sons of other workers) if the queen mates once, but should only

raise their brothers (sons of the queen) if the queen mates more than twice.

Starr (1984) uses a relatedness-based argument, but he does not provide any

calculation of evolutionary dynamics in support of his argument; he uses nei-

ther population genetics nor inclusive ﬁtness theory. In a book on honeybee

ecology, Seeley (1985) also proposed, using a relatedness-based argument,

that worker policing should occur in colonies with multiply mated queens,

but that worker policing should be absent if queens are singly mated.

Woyciechowski and Lomnicki (1987) perform a calculation based on pop-

3

ulation genetics and conclude that workers should raise their nephews (sons

of other workers) if the queen mates once, but should only raise their broth-

ers (sons of the queen) if the queen mates more than twice—the case of

double mating is neutral with respect to preference. From this result, they

claim that, under multiple mating of the queen, natural selection should fa-

vor non-reproductive workers. Woyciechowski and Lomnicki (1987) consider

both dominant and recessive alleles aﬀecting worker behavior, but they do

not consider colony eﬃciency eﬀects.

Ratnieks (1988) considers the invasion of a dominant allele for policing.

Using population genetics, he arrives at essentially the same conclusion as

Woyciechowski and Lomnicki (1987):

In the absence of eﬃciency eﬀects,

policing evolves with triple mating but not with single mating. But Ratnieks

also considers colony eﬃciency eﬀects, focusing mainly on the case where

policing improves colony eﬃciency. Since policing occurs alongside other

maintenance tasks (such as cleaning of cells, removal of pathogens, incubation

of brood), and since eating worker-laid eggs might allow workers to recycle

some of the energy lost from laying eggs, Ratnieks supposes that policing

improves colony eﬃciency. He ﬁnds that worker policing with singly mated

queens may evolve if policing improves colony reproductive eﬃciency. He

also ﬁnds that worker policing with triply mated queens may not evolve if

policing reduces colony reproductive eﬃciency, but he considered this case to

be unlikely on empirical grounds. Ratnieks does not study recessive policing

alleles. He also does not calculate evolutionary stability conditions.

Both papers (Woyciechowski and Lomnicki, 1987; Ratnieks, 1988) oﬀer

calculations based on population genetics without mentioning or calculat-

ing inclusive ﬁtness. These early studies (Starr, 1984; Seeley, 1985; Woy-

ciechowski and Lomnicki, 1987; Ratnieks, 1988) were instrumental in estab-

lishing the ﬁeld of worker policing.

Testing theoretical predictions on the evolution of worker policing in the

ﬁeld or in the lab is diﬃcult. Due to the complexities inherent in insect social-

ity, the published empirical results are not always easy to interpret. While,

so far, worker policing has been found in all species with multiple mating

that have been studied, it has also been found in about 20% of species with

singly mated queens (Hammond and Keller, 2004; Wenseleers and Ratnieks,

2006b; Bonckaert et al., 2008). Herein lies the diﬃculty: When worker polic-

ing is found in multiply mated species and found to be absent in singly mated

species, this is taken as evidence supporting the relatedness argument, and

when worker policing is found in singly mated species, it is explained away

as not being evidence against the theory, but as having evolved for other rea-

sons (such as colony eﬃciency). See, for example, the following quotation by

Bonckaert et al. (2008): “Nevertheless, our results are important in that they

show that V. germanica forms no exception to the rule that worker repro-

duction should be eﬀectively policed in a species where queens mate multiple

times (Ratnieks, 1988). Indeed, any exception to this pattern would be a

much bigger challenge to the theory than the occurrence of worker polic-

ing in species with single mating, which can be readily explained (Ratnieks,

5

1988; Foster and Ratnieks, 2001b).” This is precisely why a careful simulta-

neous consideration of relatedness, male parentage, and colony eﬃciency is

important for understanding worker policing.

We do not aim to provide an exhaustive catalog of all species in which

worker policing has been studied. We merely cite some speciﬁc examples to

add context. Policing is rampant in colonies of the honeybee (Ratnieks and

Visscher, 1989), the wasp Vespula vulgaris (Foster and Ratnieks, 2001c), and

the wasp Vespula germanica (Bonckaert et al., 2008), which are all multiply

mated. (As mentioned above, worker policing has been found in all of the

studied species to date that are multiply mated.) Worker removal of worker-

laid eggs is much less prevalent in colonies of the bumblebee (Velthuis et

al., 2002), the stingless bee, (Peters et al., 1999), and the wasp Vespula

rufa (Wenseleers et al., 2005), which are predominantly singly mated. (As

mentioned above, worker policing has been found only in about 20% of the

studied species to date that are singly mated.) There are some studies based

on observational evidence that ﬁnd policing in singly mated species; examples

of species with single mating and worker policing are Vespa crabro (Foster

et al., 2002), Camponotus ﬂoridanus (Endler et al., 2004), Aphaenogaster

smythiesi (Wenseleers and Ratnieks, 2006b), and Diacamma (Wenseleers and

Ratnieks, 2006b).

Interspecies comparisons are somewhat problematic, because even though

phylogeny can be controlled for, there are many (known and unknown) ways

in which species diﬀer in addition to mating frequency that may also aﬀect

6

the absence or presence of worker policing. Furthermore, many empirical

studies are based on genetic analyses of male parentage. (Though studies of

some species are based on actual observational evidence; see, e.g., Wenseleers

and Ratnieks (2006b).) Regarding species for which the study of policing is

based on genetic analyses, policing is often inferred if males are found to

originate predominantly from the queen. But such an inference, in cases

where it is made, presupposes that workers actively try to lay male eggs in

the ﬁrst place. It is therefore not clear how reliably genetic investigations

can measure policing.

The small number of attempts at measuring the prevalence of worker

policing in intraspeciﬁc experiments have also returned conﬂicting results.

Foster and Ratnieks (2000) report that facultative worker policing in the

saxon wasp, Dolichovespula saxonica, is more common in colonies headed by

multiply mated queens. But their sample size is only nine colonies. The

phenomenon was reinvestigated by Bonckaert et al. (2011) who report no ev-

idence of facultative worker policing depending on queen mating frequencies,

and argue that the previous result may have been ﬂawed or that there were

interpopulational variations.

Many empirical studies have emphasized that factors besides intracolony

relatedness—including the eﬀects of policing on a colony’s rate of production

of oﬀspring—may play a role in explaining evolution of worker policing (Fos-

ter and Ratnieks, 2001a,c; Hartmann et al., 2003; Hammond and Keller, 2004;

Wenseleers and Ratnieks, 2006b; Helantera and Sundstrom, 2007; Khila and

7

Abouheif, 2008; Zanette et al., 2012). Yet reliable published data on the ef-

fect that policing has on colony reproductive eﬃciency are often hard to ﬁnd.

(For some exceptions, see Wenseleers et al. (2013) and references therein.)

In this paper, we derive precise conditions for the evolutionary invasion

and evolutionary stability of police alleles. We consider any number of mat-

ings, changes in the proportion of queen-derived males, changes in colony

eﬃciency, and both dominant and recessive mutations that aﬀect the inten-

sity of policing.

Our paper is based on an analysis of evolutionary dynamics and popula-

tion genetics of haplodiploid species (Nowak et al., 2010; Olejarz et al., 2015).

It does not use inclusive ﬁtness theory. Speciﬁcally, we adapt the mathemat-

ical approach that was developed by Olejarz et al. (2015) for the evolution

of non-reproductive workers. We derive evolutionary invasion and stability

conditions for police alleles. Mathematical details are given in Appendix A.

In Section 2, we present the basic model and state the general result for

any number of matings for dominant policing alleles. In Sections 3, 4, and 5,

we speciﬁcally discuss single, double, and triple mating for dominant polic-

ing alleles. We take dominance of the policing allele to be the more realistic

possibility because the policing phenotype is a gained function. Nonetheless,

for completeness, we give the general result for recessive policing alleles in

Section 6.

In Section 7, we discuss how the shape of the eﬃciency func-

tion determines whether or not policing is more likely to evolve for single or

multiple matings. In Section 8, we analyze our results for the case where

8

the phenotypic mutation induced by the mutant allele is weak (or, equiva-

lently in our formalism, the case of weak penetrance). In this setting, the

quantity of interest is the intensity of policing. We locate the evolutionarily

singular strategies. These are the values of intensity of policing for which

mutant workers with slightly diﬀerent policing behavior are, to ﬁrst order in

the mutant phenotype, neither advantageous nor disadvantageous. We then

determine if a singular strategy is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS).

In Section 9, we discuss the relationship between policing and inclusive ﬁt-

ness theory, together with the limitations of the relatedness-based argument.

Section 10 concludes.

2. The model

We investigate worker policing in insect colonies with haplodiploid genet-

ics. Each queen mates n times. We derive conditions under which a mutation

that aﬀects worker policing can spread in a population. We make the simpli-

fying assumption, as do Woyciechowski and Lomnicki (1987) and Ratnieks

(1988), that the colony’s sex ratio is not aﬀected by the intensity of worker

policing.

First we consider the case of a dominant mutant allele. Because the

policing allele confers a gain of function on its bearer, the assumption that

it is dominant is reasonable. There are two types of males, A and a. There

are three types of females, AA, Aa, and aa. If the mutant allele is dominant,

9

then Aa and aa workers kill the male eggs of other workers, while AA workers

do not. (Alternatively, AA workers police with intensity ZAA, while Aa and

aa workers police with intensity ZAa = Zaa = ZAA + w. We consider this

case in Section 8.) For n matings, there are 3(n + 1) types of mated queens.

We use the notation AA, m, Aa, m, and aa, m to denote the genome of the

queen and the number, m, of her matings that were with mutant males, a.

The parameter m can assume values 0, 1, ..., n. A schematic of the possible

mating events is shown in Figure 1(a).

There are three types of females, AA, Aa, and aa, and there are n + 1

possible combinations of males that each queen can mate with. (For example,

a queen that mates three times (n = 3) can mate with three type A males,

two type A males and one type a male, one type A male and two type a

males, or three type a males.) Figure 1(b) shows the diﬀerent colony types

and the oﬀspring of each type of colony when each queen is singly mated.

Figure 1(c) shows the diﬀerent colony types and the oﬀspring of each type of

colony when each queen mates n times. The invasion of the mutant allele only

depends on a subset of colony types. The calculations of invasion conditions

are presented in detail in Appendix A.

2.1. Fraction of male oﬀspring produced by the queen

pz represents the fraction of males that are queen-derived if the fraction

of police workers is z.

(This quantity was already employed by Ratnieks

(1988).) The parameter z can vary between 0 and 1. For z = 0, there are

10

Figure 1: (a) The possible mating events with haplodiploid genetics are
shown. Each queen mates with n males. m denotes the number of times
that a queen mates with mutant type a males and can take values between
0 and n. Thus, there are 3(n + 1) types of colonies. (b) If each queen mates
with only a single male, then there are six types of colonies. The female
and male oﬀspring (right three columns) of each colony (leftmost column)
are shown. For example, AA, 1 colonies arise from a type AA female mating
with a single mutant type a male. AA, 1 queens produce female oﬀspring of
type Aa and male oﬀspring of type A. 50% of the oﬀspring of workers in AA, 1
colonies are of type A, while the remaining 50% of the oﬀspring of workers in
AA, 1 colonies are of type a. (c) The female and male oﬀspring (right three
columns) of each colony (leftmost column) when each queen mates n times
are shown.

11

Figure 2: The queen’s production of male eggs, pz, increases with the fraction
of workers that are policing, z. This is intuitive, since having a larger worker
police force means that a greater amount of worker-laid eggs can be eaten or
removed. Three possibilities for a monotonically increasing function pz are
shown.

no police workers in the colony, and for z = 1, all workers in the colony are

policing. We expect that pz is an increasing function of z. Increasing the

fraction of police workers increases the fraction of surviving male eggs that

come from the queen (Figure 2).

2.2. Colony eﬃciency as a function of policing

rz represents the rate at which a colony produces oﬀspring (virgin queens

and males) if the fraction of police workers is z. (This quantity was also

employed by Ratnieks (1988).) Without loss of generality we can set r0 = 1.

For a given mutation that aﬀects the intensity of policing, and for a given

biological setting, the eﬃciency function rz may take any one of a variety of

forms (Figure 3).

Colony eﬃciency depends on interactions among police workers and other

colony members. It also depends on the interactions of colonies and their en-

vironment. There are some obvious negative eﬀects that policing can have

on colony eﬃciency. By the act of killing eggs, police workers are directly di-

minishing the number of potential oﬀspring. In the process of identifying and

killing nephews, police workers may also be expending energy that could oth-

erwise be spent on important colony maintenance tasks (Cole, 1986; Naeger

et al., 2013). Policing can also be costly if there are recognitional mistakes,

i.e., queen-laid eggs may accidentally be removed by workers. Recognitional

errors could result in modiﬁcations to the sex ratio, which is an important

extension of our model but is beyond the scope of this paper.

13

00.250.500.751Fraction of police workers, z0.80.911.11.21.3Colony efficiency, rzPossible Forms for the Function rzWe can also identify positive eﬀects that policing may have on colony

eﬃciency. It has been hypothesized that the eggs which are killed by police

workers may be less viable than other male eggs (Velthuis et al., 2002; Pirk et

al., 2004; Gadagkar, 2004; Nonacs, 2006), although this possibility has been

disputed (Beekman and Oldroyd, 2005; Helantera et al., 2006; Zanette et al.,

2012). If less-viable worker-laid eggs are competing with more-viable queen-

laid male eggs, then policing may contribute positively to overall colony eﬃ-

ciency. Moreover, policing decreases the incentive for workers to expend their

energy laying eggs in the ﬁrst place (Foster and Ratnieks, 2001a; Wenseleers

et al., 2004a,b; Wenseleers and Ratnieks, 2006a), which could be another

positive inﬂuence on colony eﬃciency. (However, the decrease in incentive

for workers to reproduce due to policing would only arise on a short time

scale if there is a facultative response to policing, which is unlikely.)

As another speculative possibility: Could it be that worker egg-laying

and subsequent policing acts as a form of redistribution within the colony?

That is, suppose that it is better for colony eﬃciency to have many average-

condition workers than to have some in poor condition and some in good

condition. Suppose further, as seems realistic, that good-condition workers

are more likely to lay eggs (which are high in nutritional content, of course).

If the average police worker is of condition below the average egg-laying

worker, then worker egg-laying and policing serves to redistribute condition

among the workers, improving overall colony eﬃciency.

The special case, where policing has no eﬀect on colony eﬃciency and

14

which has informed the conventional wisdom, is ungeneric, because policing

certainly has energetic consequences for the colony that cannot be expected to

balance out completely. An early theoretical investigation of colony eﬃciency

eﬀects regarding invasion of dominant mutations that aﬀect worker policing

was performed by Ratnieks (1988).

Although monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing functions

rz are the simplest possibilities, these cases are not exhaustive. For example,

a small or moderate amount of policing may be expected to improve colony

eﬃciency. However, the precise number of police workers that are needed to

eﬀectively police the entire worker population is unclear. It is possible that a

fraction z < 1 of police workers can eﬀectively police the entire population,

and adding additional police workers beyond a certain point could result in

wasted energy, ineﬃcient use of colony resources, additional recognitional

errors, etc. These eﬀects may correspond to colony eﬃciency rz reaching a

maximum value for some 0 < z < 1.

As another possibility, suppose that police workers, when their number

is rare, directly decrease colony eﬃciency by the act of killing male eggs. It

is possible that for some z < 1, police workers are suﬃciently abundant that

their presence can be detected by other workers. Assuming the possibility of

some type of facultative response, the potentially reproductive workers may

behaviorally adapt by reducing their propensity to lay male eggs, instead

directing their energy at raising the queen’s oﬀspring. In this scenario, colony

15

eﬃciency rz may reach a minimum value for some 0 < z < 1.

2.3. Main results for dominant police alleles

We derive the following main results for dominant police alleles. If the

queen mates with n males, then the a allele for policing can invade an A

resident population provided the following “evolutionary invasion condition”

holds:

(cid:18) r1/n

(cid:19)(cid:18)r1/2

(cid:1)(cid:18) r1/n

(cid:19)

r0

> 2 −

(1)

When considering only one mutation, r0 can be set as 1 without loss of

generality. Why are the four parameters, r1/n, r1/2, p1/n, and p1/2, suﬃcient

to quantify the condition for invasion of the mutant allele, a? Since we

consider invasion of a, the frequency of the mutant allele is low. Therefore

almost all colonies are of type AA, 0, which means a wild-type queen, AA,

has mated with n wild-type males, A, and 0 mutant males, a. In addition,

the colonies Aa, 0 and AA, 1 are relevant. These are all colony types that

include exactly one mutant allele. Colony types that include more than

one mutant allele (such as Aa, 1 or AA, 2) are too rare to contribute to the

invasion dynamics. For an Aa, 0 colony, half of all workers are policing, and

therefore the parameters r1/2 and p1/2 occur in Equation (1). For an AA, 1

colony, 1/n of all workers are policing, which explains the occurrence of r1/n

and p1/n in Equation (1).

Next, we ask the converse question: What happens if a population in

16

which all workers are policing is perturbed by the introduction of a rare

mutant allele that prevents workers from policing? If the a allele for worker

policing is fully dominant, and if colony eﬃciency is aﬀected by policing,

then a resident policing population is stable against invasion by non-police

workers if the following “evolutionary stability condition” holds:

r1

r(2n−1)/2n

>

(2 + n)(2 + p1) + p(2n−1)/2n(n − 2)

2(2 + n + np1)

(2)

What is the intuition behind the occurrence of the four parameters, r1,

r(2n−1)/2n, p1, and p(2n−1)/2n? The condition applies to a population in which

all workers are initially policing. Note that, because the allele, a, for polic-

ing is fully dominant in our treatment, non-policing behavior arises if at

least two mutant A alleles for non-policing are present in the genome of the

colony, which is the combination of the queen’s genome and the sperm she

has stored. To study the invasion of a non-policing mutant allele, we must

consider all colony types that have 0, 1, or 2 mutant A alleles; these are
aa, n; aa, n − 1; Aa, n; aa, n − 2; Aa, n − 1; and AA, n. The colonies aa, n;
aa, n − 1; Aa, n; aa, n − 2; and AA, n do not contain non-police workers; the

eﬃciency of those colonies is r1, and the fraction of male eggs that originate

from the queen in those colonies is p1. Both of these parameters occur in
Equation (2). Colonies of type Aa, n − 1 produce a fraction of 1/2n non-

police workers, which explains the occurrence of r(2n−1)/2n and p(2n−1)/2n in

Equation (2).

lice allele are shown in Figure 4.

Generally, four scenarios regarding the two pure equilibria are possible:

Policing may not be able to invade and be unstable, policing may not be able

to invade but be stable, policing may be able to invade but be unstable, or

policing may be able to invade and be stable. The possibilities are shown

in Figure 5.

In the cases where policing cannot invade but is stable, or

where policing can invade but is unstable, Brouwer’s ﬁxed-point theorem

guarantees the existence of at least one mixed equilibrium. In the case where

policing can invade but is unstable, police and non-police workers will coexist

indeﬁnitely.

We will now discuss the implications of our results for particular numbers

Figure 6: If queens are singly mated (n = 1), then a plot of r1/2 versus
r1 clearly shows all four possibilities for the behavior around the two pure
equilibria. For (a), we set p1/2 = 0.75 and p1 = 1. For (b), we set p1/2 = 0.99
and p1 = 1.

Evolution of policing is highly sensitive to changes in colony eﬃciency.

For example, let us consider p1/2 = 0.99 and p1 = 1. This means that if

half of all workers police then 99% of all males come from the queen. If all

workers police then all males come from the queen. In this case, eﬃciency

values such as r1/2 = 1.001 and r1 = 1.0031 lead to the evolution of policing.

In principle, an arbitrarily small eﬃciency changes can lead to the evolution

of policing for single mating.

A plot of r1/2 versus r1 for singly mated queens (Figure 6) illustrates the

rich behavior highlighted in Figure 5. Numerical simulations of the evolu-

tionary dynamics are shown in Figure 7.

Another intriguing feature is that increases in colony eﬃciency due to

equilibrium. Figure 8 illustrates this phenomenon. Four possibilities for the

eﬃciency function rz are shown. Notice that the rz curve which results in

coexistence of police workers and non-police workers (blue, top) is strictly

greater than the rz curve which results in all workers policing (green, second

from top). How can increased eﬃciency due to policing possibly result in

policing being less abundant at equilibrium? If a mutation for non-policing

behavior is introduced into a resident policing population, then the evolu-

tionary success of the non-policing mutation depends on the success of Aa, 0

colonies relative to aa, 1, aa, 0, Aa, 1, and AA, 1 colonies. Aa, 0 colonies have

an eﬃciency parameter r1/2, while the other four relevant colonies each have

an eﬃciency parameter r1. Thus, if r1/2 is too large relative to r1, then

the non-police allele can invade a resident policing population, and there is

coexistence.

Also notice that the rz curve which results in bistability of police workers

and non-police workers (black, bottom) is strictly less than the rz curve

which results in policing being dominated by non-policing (red, second from

bottom). This phenomenon arises in a similar way: if r1/2 is too small relative

to r1, then the non-police allele cannot invade a resident policing population,

and there is bistability.

curve has the functional form rz = 1 + αz + βz2. For example, we can have:
(blue) policing invades but is unstable, α = 0.003, β = −0.0004; (green)
policing invades and is stable, α = 0.0026, β = 0; (red) policing does not

For double mating, n = 2, the invasion condition for a dominant police

allele is given by

r1/2 > 1

(5)

Thus, policing can invade if there is an inﬁnitesimal increase in colony eﬃ-

ciency when half of all workers police. Policing cannot invade if there is an

inﬁnitesimal decrease in colony eﬃciency when half of all workers police.

The stability condition for policing is given by

r1 > r3/4

(6)

Therefore the policing allele is stable if the colony eﬃciency is greater for

z = 1 (when all workers police) than for z = 3/4 (when only three quarters

of the workers police).

Four possible eﬃciency curves rz and the corresponding behavior of the

police allele are shown in Figure 9.

As a numerical example, let us consider p1/3 = 0.98 and p1/2 = 0.99. If z =

1/3 of workers police then 98% of males come from the queen. If z = 1/2 of

workers police then 99% of males come from the queen. In this case, policing

cannot invade if r1/3 = 0.9990 and r1/2 = 0.9979. In principle, arbitrarily

small reduction in colony eﬃciency can prevent evolution of policing for triple

mating.

Just as for single mating, we observe the intriguing feature that increases

in colony eﬃciency due to policing do not necessarily result in a higher

frequency of police workers at equilibrium. Figure 10 illustrates this phe-

nomenon. Four possibilities for the eﬃciency function rz are shown. Notice

that the rz curve which results in coexistence of police workers and non-

police workers (blue, top) is strictly greater than the rz curve which results

in all workers policing (green, second from top). Also notice that the rz

curve which results in bistability of police workers and non-police workers

(black, bottom) is strictly less than the rz curve which results in policing

being dominated by non-policing (red, second from bottom).

For example, we can have: (blue) policing invades but is unstable, α =

We have also derived the conditions for the emergence and evolutionary

stability of worker policing if the police allele is fully recessive. In this case,

AA and Aa workers are phenotypically identical and do not police, while aa

workers do police. (Alternatively, AA and Aa workers police with intensity

ZAA = ZAa, while aa workers police with intensity Zaa = ZAA +w = ZAa +w.

We consider this case in Section 8.)

Note that Equation (9) for invasion of a recessive police allele has the same

police allele. Starting from Equation (2), making the substitution z → 1− z,

and reversing the inequality, we recover Equation (9). The intuition behind

this correspondence is described in Appendix A.

The shape of the eﬃciency function, rz, determines whether policing is

more likely to evolve for single mating or multiple matings. Recall that rz is

the colony eﬃciency (deﬁned as the rate of generation of reproductives) if a

fraction, z, of all workers perform policing. The variable z can assume values

between 0 and 1. If no workers police, z = 0, then the colony eﬃciency is

at baseline which we set to one; therefore we have r0 = 1. Policing can in

principle both increase and decrease colony eﬃciency.

We have the following results regarding the invasion and stability of police

workers. We discuss single (n = 1), double (n = 2), and triple (n = 3)

mating. All results apply to both dominant and recessive police alleles. They

can be instantiated with arbitrarily small changes in colony eﬃciency.

Evolutionary invasion of policing

(i) If rz is strictly constant (which is ungeneric), then policing does not

invade for single mating, is neutral for double mating, and does invade for

triple mating.

(ii) If rz is monotonically decreasing, then policing either invades not at

all or only for triple mating.

(iii) If rz is monotonically increasing, then policing either invades for

single, double, and triple mating or only for double and triple mating.

(iv) If rz reaches an intermediate maximum (which means colony eﬃ-

30

ciency is highest for an intermediate fraction of police workers), then policing

can invade for n = 1, 2, 3 or n = 2, 3 or n = 3 or not at all.

(v) If rz reaches an intermediate minimum (which means colony eﬃciency

is lowest for an intermediate fraction of police workers), then policing can

invade with any pattern of matings. For example, it is possible that policing

invades only for single mating but neither for double nor triple mating. Or

it invades for single and double mating but not for triple mating.

Evolutionary stability of policing

(i) If rz is constant, then policing is unstable for single mating, is neutral

for double mating, and is stable for triple mating.

(ii) If rz is monotonically decreasing, then policing is unstable for single

and double mating. For triple mating it can be stable or unstable.

(iii) If rz is monotonically increasing, then policing either is always stable

or is stable only for double and triple mating.

(iv) If rz reaches an intermediate maximum, then policing can be stable

for any pattern of matings. For example, policing can be stable for single

mating but neither for double nor triple mating.

(v) If rz reaches an intermediate minimum, then policing can be stable

for n = 1, 2, 3 or n = 2, 3 or n = 3 or not at all.

31

Figure 12: Depending on the functional form of colony eﬃciency, rz, on the
fraction of police workers, z, policing alleles may or may not invade for single,
double, or triple mating. Various possibilities of rz are shown. The outcomes
hold both for dominant and recessive police alleles. If rz is constant, then
policing does not invade for single mating, is neutral for double mating, and
invades for triple mating. If rz decreases monotonically, then policing does
not invade or invades only for triply mating. If rz increases monotonically,
then policing either invades only for double and triple mating or for single,
double, and triple mating. If rz reaches a maximum at an intermediate value
0 < z < 1, then policing does not invade or may invade for triple mating
only, for double and triple mating, or for single, double, and triple mating. If
rz reaches a minimum at an intermediate value 0 < z < 1, then any pattern
is possible.

32

Examples for single and double mating

Figure 13 gives some interesting examples for how non-monotonic eﬃ-

ciency functions can inﬂuence the evolution of policing for single (n = 1)

and double (n = 2) mating. In order to discuss the invasion and stability

of a dominant police allele for single and double mating, we need to specify

eﬃciency at three discrete values for the fraction of police workers present in

a colony: r1/2, r3/4, and r1. Note that r0 = 1 is the baseline. Moreover, we

need to specify the fraction of male oﬀspring coming from the queen at two

values: p1/2 and p1. For all examples in Figure 13, we assume p1/2 = 0.99 and

p1 = 1. We show four cases: (a) policing invades for single mating but not

for double mating; (b) for both single and double mating, policing does not

invade but is stable; (c) for both single and double mating, policing invades

but is unstable (leading to coexistence of policing and non-policing alleles);

(d) policing does not invade but is stable for single mating; policing invades

but is unstable for double mating. These cases demonstrate the rich behavior

of the system, which goes beyond the simple view that multiple matings are

always favorable for the evolution of policing.

8. Gradual evolution of worker policing

Our main calculation applies to mutations of any eﬀect size. In this sec-

tion, we calculate the limit of incremental mutation (small mutational eﬀect

size). Our calculations in this section are reminiscent of adaptive dynamics

Figure 13: Non-monotonic eﬃciency functions can lead to rich and counter-
intuitive behavior. We consider invasion and stability of a dominant police
allele for single (n = 1) and double (n = 2) mating. The baseline colony
eﬃcient without policing is r0 = 1. Three other values must be speciﬁed:
r1/2, r3/4, and r1. Moreover, we need to specify two values for how the pres-
ence of police workers aﬀects the fraction of male oﬀspring coming from the
queen; we choose p1/2 = 0.99 and p1 = 1. A variety of behaviors can be
realized with very small variation in colony eﬃciency. (a) Policing invades
for single mating but not for double mating. (b) Policing does not invade but
is stable for single and double mating. (c) Policing invades but is unstable
for single and double mating. (d) Policing does not invade but is stable for
single mating, while policing invades but is unstable for double mating.

Law, 1996; Metz et al., 1996; Geritz et al., 1998), which is usually formulated

for asexual and haploid models. The analysis in this section applies both to

the case of small phenotypic eﬀect and to the case of weak penetrance.

Mathematically, we consider the evolutionary dynamics of policing if the

phenotypic mutations induced by the a allele are small. If an allele aﬀecting

intensity of policing is dominant, then it is intuitive to think of wild-type

workers as policing with intensity ZAA, while mutant workers police with

intensity ZAa = Zaa = ZAA + w. If an allele aﬀecting intensity of policing

is recessive, then it is intuitive to think of wild-type workers as policing

with intensity ZAA = ZAa, while mutant workers police with intensity Zaa =

ZAA + w = ZAa + w. In the limit of incremental mutation, the fraction, p,

of queen-derived males and the colony eﬃciency, r, become functions of the

average intensity of policing in the colony, which is Z + wz, where z is the

fraction of mutant workers in the colony. We have

pz → P (Z + wz) = P (Z) + P (cid:48)(Z)wz +
rz → R(Z + wz) = R(Z) + R(cid:48)(Z)wz +

(11)

We have made the substitutions pz → P (Z + wz) and rz → R(Z + wz),

and (11) gives the Taylor expansions of these quantities in terms of their

ﬁrst and second derivatives at intensity Z. (For conciseness we will often

omit the argument Z from the functions P and R and their derivatives.)
Here, |w| (cid:28) 1, so that workers with the phenotype corresponding to the

35

mutant allele only have an incremental eﬀect on colony dynamics. Thus, the
expansions (11) are accurate approximations. We assume that P (cid:48) > 0. The

sign of w can be positive or negative. If w is positive, then the mutant allele’s

eﬀect is to increase the intensity of policing. If w is negative, then the mutant

allele’s eﬀect is to decrease the intensity of policing. Note that this formalism

could also be interpreted as describing the case of weak penetrance, in which

only a small fraction of all workers that have the mutant genotype express

the mutant phenotype.

For considering the dynamics of a dominant police allele with weak phe-

notypic mutation, we introduce the quantity

(15)

Notice that (13) and (15) are, up to a multiplicative factor, the same to ﬁrst

order in w.

Using Equations (13) and (15), the condition for policing to increase from

a given level Z is

R(cid:48)(Z)
P (cid:48)(Z)

> −(n − 2)

R(Z)

2(2 + n + nP (Z))

(16)

Policing decreases from a given level Z if the opposite inequality holds. We

have explicitly written the Z dependencies in Equation (16) to emphasize
that the quantities P , P (cid:48), R, and R(cid:48) are all functions of the intensity of

policing, Z.

The left-hand side of Equation (16) can be understood as a ratio of

marginal eﬀects. To be speciﬁc, the left-hand side gives the ratio of the

marginal change in eﬃciency over the marginal increase in the proportion

of queen-derived males, if policing were to increase by a small amount. For

selection to favor to increased policing, this ratio of marginals must exceed

a quantity depending on the current values of R and P .

Notice that the sign of the right-hand side is determined by n − 2. So we

37

get diﬀerent behavior for diﬀerent numbers of matings:

• For n = 2 (double mating), policing increases from Z if and only if
R(cid:48)(Z) > 0. This means that evolution maximizes the value of R,

regardless of the behavior of P .

In other words, for double mating,

evolution maximizes colony eﬃciency regardless of the eﬀect on the

number of queen-derived males.

• For n = 1 (single mating), the right-hand side of Equation (16) is

positive. So the condition for Z to increase is more stringent than in

the n = 2 case. Increases in policing may be disfavored even if they

increase colony eﬃciency.

• For n ≥ 3 (triple mating or more than three matings), the right-hand

side of Equation (16) is negative. So the condition for Z to increase

is less stringent than in the n = 2 case. Any increase in policing that

improves colony eﬃciency will be favored, and even increases in policing

that reduce colony eﬃciency may be favored.

Equations (13) and (15) also allow us to determine the location(s) of

evolutionarily singular strategies (Geritz et al., 1998). Intuitively, a singu-
lar strategy is a particular intensity of policing, denoted by Z∗, at which

rare workers with slightly diﬀerent policing behavior are, to ﬁrst order in w,

neither favored nor disfavored by natural selection. The parameter measur-

ing intensity of policing, Z, can take values between 0 (corresponding to no

38

policing) and 1 (corresponding to full policing). There are several possibil-

ities: There may not exist a singular strategy for intermediate intensity of
policing; in this case, there is either no policing (Z∗ = 0) or full policing
If there exists a singular strategy for 0 < Z∗ < 1, then there
(Z∗ = 1).

are additional considerations: There may be convergent evolution toward
intensity Z∗ or divergent evolution away from intensity Z∗. In a small neigh-
borhood for which Z ≈ Z∗, further analysis is needed to determine if the
singular strategy corresponding to Z∗ is an ESS.

To determine the location(s) of evolutionarily singular strategies, we set

the quantity in square brackets that multiplies w in (13) and (15) to zero,

yielding

R(cid:48)(Z∗)
P (cid:48)(Z∗)

+ (n − 2)

R(Z∗)

2(2 + n + nP (Z∗))

(17)

Equation (17) gives the location(s) of singular strategies for both dominant

and recessive mutations that aﬀect policing.

For a given singular strategy Z∗, there is convergent evolution toward Z∗

There is divergent evolution away from Z∗ if the opposite inequality holds.

It is helpful to consider some examples. If the functions P (Z) and R(Z)

are known for a given species, then the behavior of worker policing with

gradual evolution can be studied. It is possible that policing is at maximal
intensity, Z∗ = 1 (Figure 14(a)), is nonexistent, Z∗ = 0 (Figure 14(b)), is

39

bistable around a critical value of intensity, 0 < Z∗ < 1 (Figure 14(c)), or
exists at an intermediate value of intensity, 0 < Z∗ < 1 (Figure 14(d)).

Note that a singular strategy may or may not be an evolutionarily stable

strategy (ESS). (For example, it is possible that there is convergent evolution
toward a particular singular strategy Z∗ which is not an ESS. In this case,
once Z ≈ Z∗, evolutionary branching may occur; Geritz et al., 1998) To

determine if (17) is an ESS, we must look at second-order terms in (12) and

(14).

For a dominant police allele, we return to (12) with the substitutions (11).

We focus on a singular strategy given by (17). For a singular strategy, Cdom

is zero to ﬁrst order in w. To second order in w, we get

Inspection of (18) and (20) allows us to determine if a singular strategy

is an ESS. If the bracketed quantity multiplying w2 is negative, then muta-

tions that change policing in either direction are disfavored. If the bracketed

quantity multiplying w2 is positive, then mutations that change policing in

either direction are favored. Thus, for a dominant allele that aﬀects intensity

of policing, the singular strategy (17) represents a local ESS if

(22)

Similarly, for a recessive allele that aﬀects intensity of policing, the singular

strategy (17) represents a local ESS if

(n − 2)(2 + n + nP )P (cid:48)(cid:48) − (n − 2)2P (cid:48)2 + 2(2 + n + nP )2R(cid:48)(cid:48) < 0

(23)

Here, P , P (cid:48), P (cid:48)(cid:48), R, R(cid:48), and R(cid:48)(cid:48) are all functions of the intensity of policing,

Z. The local ESS conditions (22) and (23) are quite opaque and do not allow

for simple analysis. Notice that, although the locations of evolutionarily

42

singular strategies are the same for dominant and recessive mutations that

inﬂuence policing, the conditions for a singular strategy to be a local ESS

are diﬀerent.

9. Policing and inclusive ﬁtness theory

It has been claimed that policing is a test case of inclusive ﬁtness theory

(Abbot et al., 2011). But the ﬁrst two papers to theoretically establish the

phenomenon (Woyciechowski and Lomnicki, 1987; Ratnieks, 1988) use stan-

dard population genetics; they do not mention the term “inclusive ﬁtness”,

and they do not calculate inclusive ﬁtness. Therefore, the claims that theo-

retical investigations of worker policing emerge from inclusive ﬁtness theory

or that empirical studies of policing test predictions of inclusive ﬁtness theory

are incorrect.

In light of known and mathematically proven limitations of inclusive ﬁt-

ness theory (Nowak et al., 2010; Allen et al., 2013), it is unlikely that inclusive

ﬁtness theory can be used to study general questions of worker policing. In-

clusive ﬁtness theory assumes that each individual contributes a separate,

well-deﬁned portion of ﬁtness to itself and to every other individual. It has

been shown repeatedly (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 1978; Uyenoyama and

Feldman, 1982; Matessi and Karlin, 1984; Nowak et al., 2010; van Veelen et

al., 2014), that this assumption does not hold for general evolutionary pro-

cesses. Therefore, inclusive ﬁtness is a limited concept that does not exist in

43

most biological situations.

Our work shows that the evolution of worker policing depends on the

eﬀectiveness of egg removal (pz) and the consequences of colony eﬃciency

(rz). Each of these eﬀects can be nonlinear (not the sum of contributions

from separate individuals), with important consequences for the fate of a

policing allele. Moreover, the invasion and stability conditions involve the

product of p- and r-values, indicating a nontrivial interaction between these

two eﬀects which does not reduce to a simple sum of costs and beneﬁts. We

also found that there are separate conditions for invasion and stability, with

neither implying the other. Inclusive ﬁtness theory, which posits a single,

linear condition for the success of a trait, is not equipped to deal with these

considerations.

Attempts to extend inclusive ﬁtness theory to more general evolutionary

processes (Queller, 1992; Frank, 1998; Gardner et al., 2011) rely on the in-

correct interpretation of linear regression coeﬃcients (Allen et al., 2013; see

also Birch and Okasha, 2014). This misuse of statistical inference tools is

unique to inclusive ﬁtness theory, and diﬀers from legitimate uses of linear

regression in quantitative genetics and other areas of science.

It was also

recently discovered that even in situations where inclusive ﬁtness does exist,

it can give the wrong result as to the direction of natural selection (Tarnita

and Taylor, 2014).

Relatedness-based arguments are often seen in conjunction with inclusive

ﬁtness, but there is a crucial diﬀerence. Consider the following statement:

44

if the queen is singly mated, then workers share more genetic material with

sons of other workers than with sons of the queen. This statement is not

wrong and could be useful in formulating evolutionary hypotheses. Such

hypotheses can then be checked using exact mathematical methods.

The problem arises when one attempts to formulate the quantity of inclu-

sive ﬁtness by partitioning ﬁtness into contributions from diﬀerent individu-

als, and reassigning of these contributions from recipient to actor. A worker

does not make separate contributions to ﬁtnesses of others, and therefore

does not have “inclusive ﬁtness”. Arguments such as “the worker maximizes

her inclusive ﬁtness by not policing” are meaningless, since they are based

on maximizing a nonexistent quantity. Moreover, when inclusive ﬁtness does

exist, it is not necessarily the quantity that is maximized by natural selection

(Okasha and Martens, 2015; Lehmann et al., 2015).

It is true that genes (alleles) can be favored by natural selection if they

enhance the reproduction of copies of themselves in other individuals. But

that argument works out on the level of genes and can be fully analyzed

using population genetics. Inclusive ﬁtness only arises when the individual is

chosen as the level of analysis, which is a problematic choice for many cases

of complex family or population structure (Akcay and Van Cleve, 2016).

Bourke (2011) has proposed that inclusive ﬁtness remains valid as a con-

cept even when it is nonexistent as a quantity. But why is such an unin-

stantiable concept useful? The mathematical theory of evolution is clear and

powerful. Exact calculations of evolutionary dynamics (Antal et al., 2009;

45

Allen and Nowak, 2014; Fu et al., 2014; Hauert and Doebeli, 2004; Szabo and

Fath, 2007; Antal and Scheuring, 2006; Traulsen et al., 2008; van Veelen et

al., 2014; Simon et al., 2013) demonstrate that inclusive ﬁtness is not needed

for understanding any phenomenon in evolutionary biology. This realization

is good news for all whose primary goal is to understand evolution rather than

to insist on a particular method of analysis. By releasing ourselves from the

conﬁnes of a mathematically limited theory, we expand the possibilities of

scientiﬁc discovery.

10. Discussion

We have derived analytical conditions for the invasion and stability of

policing in situations where queens mate once or several times and where

colony eﬃciency can be aﬀected by policing. In the special case where polic-

ing has no eﬀect on colony eﬃciency, our results conﬁrm the traditional view

that policing does not evolve for single mating, is neutral for double mating,

and does evolve for triple (or higher) mating. If colony eﬃciency depends

linearly or monotonically on the fraction of workers that are policing, then

our results support the view that multiple mating is favorable to evolution of

policing (Ratnieks, 1988). Our results also show that nonmonotonic relations

in colony dynamics and small changes in colony eﬃciency necessitate a more

careful analysis.

We ﬁnd that policing can evolve in species with singly mated queens if it

46

causes minute increases in colony eﬃciency. We ﬁnd that policing does not

evolve in species with multiply mated queens if it causes minute decreases in

colony eﬃciency. For non-monotonic eﬃciency functions, it is possible that

single mating allows evolution of policing, while multiple mating opposes

evolution of policing.

Our analysis is the ﬁrst to give precise conditions for both the invasion

and stability of policing for both dominant and recessive mutations that

aﬀect policing. We study the evolutionary invasion and evolutionary stability

of policing both analytically and numerically. For any number of matings,

there are four possible outcomes (see Figure 5): (i) policing can invade and

is stable; (ii) policing can invade but is not stable, leading to coexistence;

(iii) policing cannot invade but is stable, leading to bistability; (iv) policing

cannot invade and is unstable. We give precise conditions for all outcomes

both for dominant and recessive police alleles. All outcomes can be achieved

with arbitrarily small changes in colony eﬃciency.

Our calculations are not based on any assumption about the strength of

phenotypic mutation induced by an allele. The conditions (1), (2), (9), and

(10) also describe the dynamics of mutations that have an arbitrarily small

phenotypic eﬀect on colony dynamics. This facilitates investigation of the

evolution of complex social behaviors that result from gradual accumulation

of many mutations (Kapheim et al., 2015). We derive a simple relation,

Equation (17), for the location(s) of evolutionarily singular strategies. We

also derive precise conditions for a singular strategy to be an ESS. These

47

results are applicable for understanding both the case of weak phenotypic

eﬀect and the case of weak penetrance.

Our analysis does not use inclusive ﬁtness theory. Given the known limi-

tations of inclusive ﬁtness (Nowak et al., 2010; Allen et al., 2013), it is unlikely

that inclusive ﬁtness theory could provide a general framework for analyzing

the evolution of worker policing.

In summary, the main conclusions of our paper are: (i) The prevalent

relatedness-based argument that policing evolves under multiple mating but

not under single mating is not robust with respect to arbitrarily small vari-

ations in colony eﬃciency; (ii) For non-monotonic eﬃciency functions, it is

possible that policing evolves for single mating, but not for double or triple

mating; (iii) Careful measurements of colony eﬃciency and the fraction of

queen-derived males are needed to understand how natural selection acts

on policing; (iv) Contrary to what has been claimed (Abbot et al., 2011),

the phenomenon of worker policing is no empirical conﬁrmation of inclusive

ﬁtness theory; the ﬁrst two mathematical papers on worker policing (Woy-

ciechowski and Lomnicki, 1987; Ratnieks, 1988) do not use inclusive ﬁtness

theory. The present paper, which also does not use inclusive ﬁtness theory,

is the ﬁrst detailed analysis of policing for any number of matings and taking

into account eﬀects on colony eﬃciency.

Appendix A. Stability Analysis

In this Supporting Information, we introduce a population genetics-based

model for insect dynamics in the Hymenoptera, and we calculate precise

conditions that must be satisﬁed if worker policing is to evolve. Our model

is consistent with haplodiploid genetics. We postulate that a speciﬁc locus is

responsible for worker policing. The A allele is wild-type, while the mutant

a allele leads to unmated females killing the male eggs of other unmated

females. If the a allele is dominant, then workers that have at least one a

allele kill other workers’ male eggs. If the a allele is recessive, then workers

that are homozygous in the a allele kill other workers’ male eggs. What

conditions on the colony parameters are suﬃcient for worker policing to arise

and be established in a population? The mathematical analysis is similar

to that in Olejarz et al. (2015). The calculations for both dominant and

recessive alleles aﬀecting policing are presented below.

49

Description of the Model

We study a population of insects that follows haplodiploid genetics, in

which females have homologous pairs of maternal and paternal chromosomes,

and males have a single set of chromosomes. Queens produce female workers

and gynes (future queens) from her own genotype and using sperm from the

male drones that she has mated with. Queens also produce drones. Female

workers, though unfertilized, lay male eggs as well. Each colony produces

many oﬀspring, and the population is made of many colonies.

We investigate the dynamics of two alleles, A and a, that enable us to

study the evolutionary emergence and stability of worker policing—i.e., the

eating of worker-laid male eggs by workers. The A allele generates a pheno-

type such that a worker does not police (or that policing occurs with intensity

Z). The a allele generates a phenotype such that a worker performs policing

(or that policing occurs with intensity Z + w).

Our analysis of the invasion of police workers is general and open to

multiple interpretations. For example, we have thus far considered that wild-

type workers perform no policing, while workers carrying the mutant allele

police. In this view, p0 represents the fraction of male eggs that originate

from the queen when no workers are policing, while pz > p0 represents the

fraction of male eggs that originate from the queen when a fraction z > 0 of

workers are policing. We may instead consider the case where all workers are

policing and view our parameter z as representing the intensity of policing.

It is possible that wild-type workers perform policing with intensity Z, while

50

mutant workers perform policing with increased intensity Z + w > Z. In this

alternative view, p0 represents the fraction of male eggs that originate from

the queen when all workers police with intensity Z, while pz > p0 represents

the fraction of male eggs that originate from the queen when a fraction z > 0
of workers police with intensity Z + w, while the remaining fraction 1 − z of

workers police with intensity Z. Regardless of interpretation, only changes

in the resulting function pz, which measures the fraction of male eggs that

originate from the queen as a function of the fraction of mutant workers in

the colony, aﬀect the condition for invasion of worker policing in our model.

Of course, there may be biological diﬀerences between adding more police

workers or simply increasing the intensity at which existing workers police,

but such biological diﬀerences would be studied by adding parameters to our

model. To keep the presentation here as simple as possible, we will reserve

such biological subtleties for study in a future publication.

The parameter n is the number of males with which the colony’s queen

has mated. An illustration of the mating events is shown in Figure 1(a).
There are several possibilities: A type AA gyne mates with n − m type A
males and m type a males. A type Aa gyne mates with n − m type A males
and m type a males. A type aa gyne mates with n− m type A males and m

type a males.

A reproductive female (queen) mates with n randomly chosen males in

the population. For mating, the gynes and drones are well-mixed: If a gyne

from one colony mates with n drones, then each of the n drones is chosen

51

randomly from among the colonies in the population.

The selection dynamics in continuous time are described by a simple

system of diﬀerential equations:

(A.1)

(In what follows, we use the overdot notation to denote the time derivative,

d/dt.)

We make sense of Eq. (A.1) as follows. Each queen has one of three

possible combinations of the A and a alleles in her own genotype; she can

have type AA, type Aa, or type aa. Each queen also has sperm stored from

her matings, and m represents the number of mutant males (type a males)

that a queen has mated with. Since each colony is headed by a single queen,

the variables XAA,m, XAa,m, and Xaa,m can be used to refer to either a colony

or to the queen that heads the colony; either intuition is acceptable. The
number of colonies with a type AA queen who has mated with n− m type A

males and m type a males is represented by XAA,m. The number of colonies
with a type Aa queen who has mated with n − m type A males and m

type a males is represented by XAa,m. The number of colonies with a type
aa queen who has mated with n − m type A males and m type a males is

represented by Xaa,m. xAA, xAa, and xaa represent the numbers of gynes

52

(reproductive females) in the population with the three possible genotypes.

yA and ya represent the numbers of drones in the population with the two
possible genotypes. A gyne mates randomly with n − m type A males and

m type a males in the population (i.e.; the population is well-mixed in terms

of mating). The binomial coeﬃcient measures all possible ways in which a

gyne can mate with m males of type a out of n total matings.

Due to enviromental factors, the total number of colonies is constant

(with value c) at all times:

n(cid:88)

(XAA,m + XAa,m + Xaa,m) = c

(A.2)

m=0

Since environmental resources that are necessary for colonies to thrive are

limited, the requirement that the total number of colonies is constant in time

is biologically justiﬁable. Consequently, φ in Eq. (A.1) represents a density-

dependent colony death rate, and we use φ to model the limiting eﬀects of

environmental constraints on the total number of colonies. To maintain the

density constraint, Eq. (A.2), on the colony variables, we choose φ to equal

φ = c−1(xAA + xAa + xaa)(yA + ya)n

(A.3)

We acknowledge that there may be diﬀerent ways to perform the cal-

culations that follow. We feel that working in continuous time is easiest

and simpliﬁes the analysis. When calculations must be performed to second

order in a perturbation (for example, when considering the invasion of a re-

cessive police allele or the stability of a dominant police allele), working in

53

continuous time is quite convenient.

We now introduce the biological parameters of our model. The appear-

ance of police workers aﬀects the fraction of male eggs in a colony that come

from the queen. If a fraction z of workers in a colony are policing, then the

fraction of male oﬀspring that come from the queen is denoted by pz. The

form of the quantity pz for 0 < z < 1 is likely species-dependent. However,

it is reasonable to expect that pz is an increasing function of z, because an

increase in the proportion of workers that are policing results in a larger

proportion of queen-produced males.

Equally important is the eﬃciency, rz, of a colony in which a fraction z

of workers are policing. Intuitively, the parameter rz is the total number of

oﬀspring produced by a colony when a fraction z of workers in the colony

are policing. The most important point conceptually is that the ratios of

colony eﬃciency values, rz, for colonies with diﬀerent genotypes—i.e., the

relative reproductive eﬃciencies of colonies with diﬀerent genotypes—are the

important quantities for understanding the evolutionary emergence of worker

policing.

It is helpful to rewrite everything in Eq. (A.1) in terms of the colony

variables, XAA,m, XAa,m, and Xaa,m. Speciﬁcally, we must rewrite the ﬁrst

term on the right-hand side of Eq. (A.1) in terms of the colony variables.

We express each of the gyne and drone numbers, xAA, xAa, xaa, yA, and ya,

as a simple linear sum of the colony variables, XAA,m, XAa,m, and Xaa,m. In

these linear relationships, the coeﬃcients depend on whether the allele, a,

54

acting in a worker to induce that worker’s policing behavior is dominant or

recessive.

Reproductives of Each Type of Colony

For each colony following haplodiploid genetics, and with single mating of

each queen, we have the reproduction events shown in Figure 1(b). For each

colony following haplodiploid genetics, and with n matings of each queen
(with n ≥ 1), we have the reproduction events shown in Figure 1(c).

Figure 1(c) can be interpreted as follows.

Consider the individuals produced by type AA, m colonies. The queen
makes n − m type AA females for every m type Aa females that she makes.

Because the queen only has the A allele, she can only make type A drones.
A fraction n − m of all workers make only type A males, and a fraction m

of all workers make type A males and type a males in equal numbers. In all,
workers make (2n − m) type A males for every m type a males.

Consider the individuals produced by type Aa, m colonies. The queen
makes n − m type AA females, n type Aa females, and m type aa females

out of every 2n females that it makes. Since the queen carries the A and

a alleles, she makes type A drones and type a drones in equal numbers.
A fraction n − m of all workers make only type A males, a fraction n of all

workers make type A males and type a males in equal numbers, and a fraction
m of all workers make only type a males. In all, workers make (3n − 2m)

type A males for every n + 2m type a males.

Consider the individuals produced by type aa, m colonies. The queen

55

makes n − m type Aa females for every m type aa females that it makes.

Because the queen only has the a allele, she can only make type a drones. A
fraction n − m of all workers make type A males and type a males in equal

numbers, and a fraction m of all workers make only type a males. In all,
workers make n − m type A males for every n + m type a males.

We do not consider stochastic eﬀects here because the number of individ-

uals produced by a colony is assumed to be very large. Thus, the fractions

of colony oﬀspring with each possible genotype is always exactly the same

for that type of colony.

Reproductives with a Dominant Policing Allele

We focus on the evolution of the 3(n + 1) colony variables. An important

step is to write all quantities in terms of the colony variables. Each type

of reproductive of a colony (xAA, xAa, xaa, yA, and ya) can be written as a

simple weighted sum of colony variables. From looking at Figure 1(c), the

numbers of unfertilized females (xAA, xAa, and xaa) and males (yA and ya)

in the population which are reproductive (i.e., capable of mating) can be

0 < g ≤ 1 is the fraction of all females that are gynes. Likewise, 0 < k ≤ 1

is the fraction of all males that are able to mate. For instance, we might
expect that g (cid:28) 1 and k (cid:28) 1, which means that only a small amount of

the total number of males and females produced by each colony are capable

of dispersing, mating, and starting new colonies. We explicitly write the

parameters g and k here for conceptual clarity; they end up being irrelevant

in the conditions for invasion and stability of police workers.

Reproductives with a Recessive Policing Allele

We focus on the evolution of the 3(n + 1) colony variables. An important

step is to write all quantities in terms of the colony variables. Each type

57

of reproductive of a colony (xAA, xAa, xaa, yA, and ya) can be written as a

0 < g ≤ 1 is the fraction of all females that are gynes. Likewise, 0 < k ≤ 1

is the fraction of all males that are able to mate. For instance, we might
expect that g (cid:28) 1 and k (cid:28) 1, which means that only a small amount of

the total number of males and females produced by each colony are capable

of dispersing, mating, and starting new colonies. We explicitly write the

parameters g and k here for conceptual clarity; they end up being irrelevant

in the conditions for invasion and stability of police workers.

Rescaling of the Model Variables

We have presented the biological intuition for our mathematical model

that describes the population genetics of Hymenopteran insect colonies. For

the calculations of evolutionary dynamics of worker policing that follow, it

is mathematically convenient to make the following substitutions:

XAA,m → cXAA,m
XAa,m → cXAa,m
Xaa,m → cXaa,m
xAA → gcxAA
xAa → gcxAa
xaa → gcxaa
yA → kcyA
ya → kcya
φ → gkncnφ
t → g−1k−nc−nt

(A.6)

Rescaling the model variables and parameters according to Eq. (A.6) leads

to simpliﬁcations in the mathematics. We substitute Eq.

Diﬀerences Between Our Model of Policing and the Model in Ole-
jarz et al. (2015)

A key point distinguishes our model of policing from the model of non-

reproductive workers presented in Olejarz et al. (2015).

In our model of

policing, mutant workers lay male eggs. In the model of non-reproductive

workers (Olejarz et al., 2015), mutant workers do not lay male eggs. There-

fore, the “Workers’ Sons” column in Figure 1(c) diﬀers from the “Workers’

Sons” column in Figure 1(b,c) of Olejarz et al. (2015). Consequently, yA and

ya of Eq. (A.10) diﬀer from yA and ya of Eq. (14) in Olejarz et al. (2015).

62

Also, yA and ya of Eq. (A.11) diﬀer from yA and ya of Eq. (15) in Olejarz et

al. (2015).

Conditions for Evolutionary Invasion and Evolutionary Stability of
Worker Policing: Perturbative Analysis

After rescaling the model variables and parameters according to Eq.

(A.6), the evolutionary dynamics are mathematically unchanged: Eq. (A.1)

is identical in form to Eq. (A.7), Eq. (A.2) is identical in form to Eq. (A.8),

Eq. (A.3) is identical in form to Eq. (A.9), and Eq. (A.4) is identical in

form to Eq. (A.10). But the rescalings (A.6) are helpful in doing calcula-

tions. Notice that when the right-hand side of (A.7) is expressed in terms of

the colony frequency variables XAA,m, XAa,m, and Xaa,m, the parameters g,

k, and c, which are not necessary for understanding the evolutionary invasion

or evolutionary stability of police workers, disappear from the calculations.

This simpliﬁes presentation and clarity in the calculations that follow.

To begin, notice that our model admits only two pure equilibria:
• XAA,0 = 1 with all other colony variables equal to zero. In this case,

the a allele is absent from every individual in the population.

• Xaa,n = 1 with all other colony variables equal to zero. In this case,

the A allele is absent from every individual in the population.

As seen from Eqs. (A.7), if any mixed equilibria exist, then they will corre-

spond to all 3(n + 1) colony frequency variables being nonzero.

63

Appendix A.1. Invasion of a Dominant Worker Policing Allele

We start with an inﬁnitesimal quantity of the mutant allele, a, and we

perturb the XAA,0 = 1 pure equilibrium: XAA,0 → 1 − δ(1)

AA,0? Does a

dominant worker policing allele spread in the population, or is it eliminated?

There are a total of 3n + 3 types of colonies, and with the density con-

straint, there are 3n + 2 independent colony variables. However, the cal-
if  (cid:28) 1), then only

If the perturbation is small (i.e.

culation simpliﬁes.

three colony types, AA, 0, AA, 1, and Aa, 0, determine whether or not the

dominant worker policing allele invades. Any other colony type has a queen

that contains at least two mutant a alleles (from her own genotype combined

with the sperm she has stored), but such queens are so rare that they are

negligible. The relevant equations among (A.7) for understanding invasion

of a dominant police allele are

˙XAA,0 = xAAyn
˙XAA,1 = nxAAyn−1

A − φXAA,0
A ya − φXAA,1
A − φXAa,0

˙XAa,0 = xAayn

Formally keeping track of powers of , and neglecting higher-order terms, we

have:

Appendix A.2. Invasion of a Recessive Worker Policing Allele

We start with an inﬁnitesimal quantity of the mutant allele, a, and we

perturb the XAA,0 = 1 pure equilibrium: XAA,0 → 1 − δ(1)

AA,0? Does a

recessive worker policing allele spread in the population, or is it eliminated?

There are a total of 3n + 3 types of colonies, and with the density con-

straint, there are 3n + 2 independent colony variables. However, the calcula-
tion again simpliﬁes. If the perturbation is small (i.e. if  (cid:28) 1), then only six

colony types, AA, 0, AA, 1, Aa, 0, AA, 2, Aa, 1, and aa, 0, determine whether

or not the recessive worker policing allele invades. Any other colony type has

a queen that contains at least three mutant a alleles (from her own genotype

combined with the sperm she has stored), but such queens are so rare that

they are negligible. The relevant equations among (A.7) for understanding

66

invasion of a recessive police allele are

˙XAA,0 = xAAyn

Recall that for investigation of the dominant allele, it was only necessary

to consider terms of order  to obtain conditions for invasion of the mutant

allele. For analysis of the recessive allele, terms of order  do not provide

all information needed for determining if the allele invades, making the cal-

culation more involved. Formally keeping track of powers of  and 2, and

neglecting higher-order terms, we have:

The simpliﬁed density constraint, Eq. (A.14), holds for both dominant or

for the case of a recessive police allele. We substitute (A.18) into (A.8) and

collect powers of 2. We get

To see if the a allele is able to invade the resident A population, we must

the terms with time-dependence in Eqs. (A.26), (A.27), (A.28), and (A.29)

will approach zero. The important consideration is the sign of ˙δ(2)

Appendix A.3. Stability of a Dominant Worker Policing Allele

If we start with a population in which all workers are policing, and if we

introduce a small amount of the non-policing allele, A, and if the policing

allele, a, is dominant, then is policing evolutionarily stable?

There is a shortcut to obtaining the evolutionary stability condition for

a dominant policing allele. Recall what the calculations of Appendix A.2

for invasion of a recessive policing allele are describing: We start with a

homogenous population of colonies in which all individuals carry only the

A allele. A fraction p0 of males are queen-derived, and each colony has

reproductive eﬃciency r0. The only eﬀects of the mutant allele are to shift

76

the value of p such that pz > p0 for z > 0 and to modify the colony eﬃciency,
rz (cid:54)= r0. z here is the fraction of workers in a colony that are homozygous in

the a allele.

Now consider the evolutionary stability of a dominant a allele that aﬀects

policing. Again, in the calculation, we start with a homogeneous population

of colonies, but in this case, all individuals carry only the a allele. A fraction

p1 of males are queen-derived, and each colony has reproductive eﬃciency

r1. The only eﬀect of the mutant allele is to shift the value of p such that
p1−z < p1 for z < 1 and to modify the colony eﬃciency, r1−z (cid:54)= r1. z here is

the fraction of workers in a colony that are homozygous in the A allele. (Since

the a allele for policing is dominant, AA workers have a distinct phenotype,

while Aa and aa workers have the same phenotype.)

Notice that, for worker policing, the mathematical analysis of invasion of

a recessive policing allele necessarily also provides the condition for evolu-

tionary stability of a dominant policing allele. Start with Condition (A.31).

Because the genotype of the initial population that we consider is reversed

(i.e., all individuals initially carry only the a allele as opposed to the A allele),
we make the replacement z → 1 − z in (A.31). Also, evolutionary stability

of the a allele means that the mutant allele for non-policing, A, is unable

to invade a resident a population, so we reverse the sign of the inequality in

(A.31).

Thus, if the police allele, a, is dominant, then worker policing is evolu-

77

tionarily stable if

Appendix A.4. Stability of a Recessive Worker Policing Allele

If we start with a population in which all workers are policing, and if we

introduce a small amount of the non-policing allele, A, and if the policing

allele, a, is recessive, then is policing evolutionarily stable?

There is a shortcut to obtaining the evolutionary stability condition for

a recessive policing allele. Recall what the calculations of Appendix A.1

for invasion of a dominant policing allele are describing: We start with a

homogenous population of colonies in which all individuals carry only the

A allele. A fraction p0 of males are queen-derived, and each colony has

reproductive eﬃciency r0. The only eﬀects of the mutant allele are to shift

the value of p such that pz > p0 for z > 0 and to modify the colony eﬃciency,
rz (cid:54)= r0. z here is the fraction of workers in a colony that carry at least one

copy of the a allele.

Now consider the evolutionary stability of a recessive a allele that aﬀects

policing. Again, in the calculation, we start with a homogeneous population

of colonies, but in this case, all individuals carry only the a allele. A fraction

p1 of males are queen-derived, and each colony has reproductive eﬃciency

r1. The only eﬀect of the mutant allele is to shift the value of p such that

78

p1−z < p1 for z < 1 and to modify the colony eﬃciency, r1−z (cid:54)= r1. z here

is the fraction of workers in a colony that carry at least one copy of the A

allele. (Since the a allele for policing is recessive, AA and Aa workers have

the same phenotype, while aa workers have a distinct phenotype.)

Notice that, for worker policing, the mathematical analysis of invasion of

a dominant policing allele necessarily also provides the condition for evolu-

tionary stability of a recessive policing allele. Start with Condition (A.16).

Because the genotype of the initial population that we consider is reversed

of the a allele means that the mutant allele for non-policing, A, is unable

to invade a resident a population, so we reverse the sign of the inequality in

(A.16).

Thus, if the police allele, a, is recessive, then worker policing is evolution-
