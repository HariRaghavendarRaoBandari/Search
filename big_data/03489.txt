Abstract

There is a well explored relationship between quantum mechanical scattering from a potential and
the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation of ﬂuid dynamics: if the potential is ‘evolved’ according to
the KdV equation then it will have the same reﬂectivity and transmissivity as a function of energy,
for each snapshot in time. In this work we explore this connection in optics, where the permittivity
plays the role of the potential. We begin by deriving the relationship between the Helmholtz
equation and the KdV equation in terms of the current induced in a material when a permittivity
proﬁle is changed slightly. It is then shown that the KdV equation can be used to design a plethora
of bounded complex potentials that are relfectionless from both sides for all angles of incidence,
and planar periodic media that exhibit a real Bloch vector for all angles of propagation. Finally
we apply the KdV equation to reduce the reﬂection of a wave from an interface between two media
of diﬀering refractive indices.

INTRODUCTION

Wave propagation through inhomogeneous materials is more subtle than an application
of ray optics would suggest. When the material properties change on a scale that is compa-
rable to the wavelength then the wave will reﬂect, and in general the reﬂection depends in
an intricate way on the exact spatial dependence of the material properties. Until relatively
recently it was diﬃcult to explore these subtle interactions of waves with matter, simply
because the material properties could not be precisely speciﬁed as a function of position.
However, this situation has now changed somewhat; ‘metamaterial’ structures [1–3] have
been developed, where the material is engineered on a sub–wavelength scale so that it can
be treated as a continuous function of position. Such structures have been developed for
controlling electromagnetic [4], acoustic [5], and water waves [6], as well as diﬀusion phenom-
ena such as heat [7]. To determine the necessary material properties to manipulate the wave
in a desired way, one applies theories such as transformation optics [8, 9], which exploit the
equivalence between inhomogeneous material properties and coordinate transformations.

The purpose of this paper is to explore how a diﬀerent equivalence might be used to
understand the eﬀect of inhomogeneous media on the propagation of waves. We shall illus-
trate how a family of non–linear wave equations (known as the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV)
hierarchy [10]) can be used to manipulate the reﬂectivity of a planar electromagnetic ma-
terial through ‘evolving’ the permittivity proﬁle (x) from one functional form to another.
Although the literature on the relationship between the KdV hierarchy and the Helmholtz
equation is vast (see e.g. [11] and references therein), the typical concern is with using the
Helmholtz equation as a tool for solving the KdV equation rather the reverse, and the possi-
bility of investigating this relationship with metamaterial structures does not seem to have
been considered. Here we imagine a regime that seems to be possible with metamaterials,
where we have a very ﬁne control over an isotropic permittivity (x) as a function of posi-
tion, in comparison to the wavelength of interest, and that we can control both its real and
imaginary parts.

In the ﬁrst part of this work we re–derive the result that ‘evolving’ a permittivity proﬁle
(x) in ‘time’ according to the KdV equation leads to a continuous family of proﬁles that
all have a reﬂectivity that is diﬀerent only by a phase. This derivation is carried out in
terms of the current that must be induced in a material when the permittivity proﬁle is
changed slightly. Requiring that the radiation at x produced by this current only change
the ﬁeld in a way that depends on ﬁeld values inﬁnitesimally close to x leads us to the
ﬁrst two evolution equations in the KdV hierarchy. We then show that some recent results
concerning reﬂectionless media [12–15] can be derived in the same way.

The second part of the paper is concerned with the possible application of the KdV
hierarchy to the design of planar permittivity proﬁles. We demonstrate the design of a
family of complex materials that are reﬂectionless from both sides for all angles of incidence,
and periodic planar media that do not exhibit a band gap for any angle of propagation.
Finally we demonstrate that the KdV equation can be used to modify an interface between
two diﬀerent values of the permittivity in such a way that the reﬂectivity is reduced for a
range of angles of incidence. Throughout this work we treat waves of a single frequency, and
interest ourselves in manipulating the reﬂection of a planar medium as a function of angle.

II. TRAJECTORIES THROUGH EQUIVALENT INHOMOGENEOUS MEDIA

Given the lack of many general statements one can make about wave propagation through
inhomogeneous media, one line of attack is to separate out the possible functions (x) into
families that have closely related scattering properties. Take for example monochromatic
electromagnetic waves polarized along ˆz and propagating in the x–y plane through an in-
homogeneous slab with complex permittivity s(x) = 1 + us(x). These are governed by the
Helmholtz equation

where ϕs is the electric ﬁeld amplitude, ky = k0 sin(θ) is the in–plane wavevector determining
the angle of incidence θ, and us(x) → 0 as |x| → ∞. The subscript ‘s’ on the permittivity
labels one of a continuous family of inhomogeneous media (schematic shown in ﬁgure 1).
Diﬀerentiating (1) with respect to s we can determine how the ﬁeld changes as we move
along a trajectory through this family of proﬁles

where hs(x) is some combination of the two solutions to the homogeneous equation (1) that
we are free to choose and Gs(x, x(cid:48), k0) is the retarded Green function, obeying the equation

Gs(x, x(cid:48), k0) = δ(x − x(cid:48))

Equation (2) tells us that the ﬁeld at a ﬁxed position x in the proﬁle us+ds(x) diﬀers

FIG. 1: A schematic illustration of ‘permittivity space’. The possible permittivity proﬁles s =
1 + us are parameterised by a ‘time’ s and we move through ‘permittivity space’ so that the ﬁeld
changes according to (4): ∂sϕs(x) = ˆAs(x)ϕs(s). This results in a family of generally complex
permittivity proﬁles with identical transmission coeﬃcients, and reﬂection coeﬃcients that change
according to (5). An example of such an evolution is given by the Korteweg–de Vries equation
(11).

from that in us(x) generally depending on all other points in space. While this is not at
all informative in the general case, this paper is concerned with those particular choices of
evolution equation ∂us/∂s when the right hand side of (2) can be made to depend only on
x

∂ϕs(x)

∂s

= ˆAs(x)ϕs(x)

(4)

with ˆAs(x) some operator depending on s(x) and derivatives with respect to x (it is a local
operator). To better understand the physical meaning of reducing (2) to (4), suppose we
understand j = (∂sus)ϕs as a current, which is the source of radiation ∂sϕs in (2). Our
choice of ∂sus that leads to (4) amounts to a choice of envelope function within the current
distribution j such that the radiation that reaches x from all other points in space cancels
out, leaving only that coming from inﬁnitesimally close to x. That this is at all possible in
any non–trivial cases is surprising, and as we shall see sometimes quite useful.

Equation (4) is of the same form as the time dependent Schr¨odinger equation, and by
analogy the general solution is a path ordered exponential [16]. An important aspect of
the theory we are discussing is that in many cases ˆAs can be reduced to something inde-
pendent of ‘time’ (‘s’) when |x| → ∞, because here the permittivity reduces to unity. The
path ordering then ceases to matter and we have ϕs(x) = exp( ˆAs)ϕ0(x). Now consider a
wave incident from the left of the proﬁle. On the far left we have an incident wave plus
a reﬂected one, ϕ0 = exp(ikxx) + r0 exp(−ikxx). The ‘evolution’ over s changes this to
ϕs = exp(A(ikx)s) exp(ikxx) + r0 exp(A(−ikx)s) exp(−ikxx), where kx = [k2
y]1/2 and
A(ikx) is the function obtained from replacing the derivatives within the operator by ikx.
Therefore in cases where (4) holds for all x, the reﬂection coeﬃcient from the proﬁle rs
‘evolves’ in ‘time’ as follows

0 − k2

rs = e−[A(ikx)−A(−ikx)]sr0

(5)

(6)

and the transmission coeﬃcient is left unchanged

ts = t0.

This paper is concerned with the application of (5–6) to manipulate the reﬂection from
inhomogeneous complex media.

A. Translational symmetry

We haven’t yet shown that the change in the ﬁeld (2) can ever be written as the local
operation (4). This can be demonstrated in a rather elementary case, where the trajectory
parameterized by ‘s’ simply corresponds to a translation of the permittivity proﬁle in space.
A family of permittivity proﬁles that are all of the same shape, but centred at diﬀerent

positions can be generated by

∂us(x)

∂s

= V

∂us(x)

∂x

where V is the ‘velocity’ at which the proﬁle moves as a function of s. Substituting this into
(2), integrating by parts, and applying (1) and (3) we obtain

The boundary terms from the integral correspond to waves whose source lies at inﬁnity;
solutions to the homogeneous equation (1). Therefore hs can always be chosen to eliminate
these terms and we are left with

the right hand side of which is of the form (4), with ˆA = V ∂x. Thus the reﬂection coeﬃcients
change with s according to

rs = e−2ikxV sr0

(9)

with the transmission coeﬃcients unaltered. This is the expected change in the reﬂection
coeﬃcient after a translation of the permittivity by a distance V s. Note that V is not
restricted to real values, and that a translation of the proﬁle by a complex distance will
exponentially amplify or diminish the reﬂection rather than shift it by a phase [15].

There are an inﬁnite number of less elementary evolution equations for us that reduce
the change in the ﬁeld (2) to a local operation (4). For example suppose the evolution of
the permittivity is governed by some third order diﬀerential equation ∂sus = a∂3
xus + . . ..
With this form of evolution [32], the change in the ﬁeld (2) reduces to

(10)

the integral term in (10) can be removed through—as in the preceding section—choosing
the homogeneous part of the ﬁeld hs to eliminate any boundary terms, and choosing the
evolution equation for us to be,

initially applied to the propagation of shallow water waves, but has since appeared in many
areas of physics, including plasma physics [18] and acoustics [19]. If the permittivity proﬁle is
subject to evolution by (11)—which is notably independent of ky—the ﬁeld correspondingly

with the transmission coeﬃcients unchanged. Figure 2 demonstrates the validity of (13)
for real a, showing that a slab of uniform real permittivity evolved in ‘time’ according to
the KdV equation becomes a complicated sum of solitary waves, while retaining the same
reﬂectivity as a function of angle. It is interesting to note that a wave evolving according
to the KdV equation satisﬁes an inﬁnite number of conservation laws [10], the ﬁrst two of
which are ∂s
sdx = 0: for us this translates into an inﬁnite number of
integrals of functions of the permittivity that must remain identical for the medium to have
the same reﬂectivity as a function of angle.

A similar procedure can be carried out to generate a bewildering variety of evolution
equations for us, some of which are unavoidably dependent on ky and some not. Besides
patience, what one learns is; ﬁrstly that there are a vast number of permittivity proﬁles
with identical reﬂectivity as a function of angle; and less surprisingly that there is an even
more vast set of proﬁles with the same reﬂectivity at a ﬁxed angle of incidence, all of which
can be generated in a systematic way. As a further example we take ∂sus = a∂5

evolution equations (11) and (14) are simply the ﬁrst two of what is known as the ‘KdV

evolution of which the reﬂection coeﬃcient transforms as (5).

C. Kramers–Kronig media

Recent work [12–15] has shown that complex inhomogenous media satisfying the spatial
Kramers–Kronig relations have curious scattering properties, being generally reﬂectionless
from one side and in many cases having unit transmission. Although not initially cast as
such, this is also a case when the ‘evolution’ of the ﬁeld can be written asymptotically as a
local operation (4), which we now brieﬂy describe.

Suppose that our initial permittivity proﬁle is vacuum us = 0, and that we consider a

right–going wave ϕ0(x) = exp(ikxx). In this case the change in the ﬁeld (2) is equal to

where we imposed hs = 0 and used the free space Green function: G(x, x(cid:48), k0) = exp(ikx|x−
x(cid:48)|)/2ikx. We now consider the position as a complex variable x = x(cid:48) + ix(cid:48)(cid:48), and take ∂us/∂s
as an analytic function that tends to zero as |x| → ∞ in the upper half complex position
plane. As we take (16) towards inﬁnity in the upper half plane the ﬁrst term in the square
brackets decays exponentially to zero as e−kxx(cid:48)(cid:48)
. The second term decays with the same

for large N the integral term on the second line becomes negligibly small as we move far
into the upper half plane. Therefore ∂ϕs/∂s is analytic and asymptotically tends to zero in
the upper half complex position plane. Given that functions that are analytic in one half of
the complex position have one–sided Fourier (k) spectra [23] this means that we can change
the permittivity away from vacuum by adding in an inhomogeneous part that is analytic in
one half of the complex position plane and we will not generate any counter propagating
waves: there will be no reﬂection from the proﬁle. Indeed, this is not just true for small
changes of the permittivity away from vacuum, but there is never any reﬂection generated
if we continue to change us in such a way that it remains analytic in one half of the complex
position plane. To see this, consider the formula for the second derivative of ϕs with respect
to s

From our analysis of ∂ϕs/∂s we can see that, so long as ∂2us/∂s2 is analytic and tends to
zero in the upper half plane then Us will also have this property. Thus, given that (18) is
of the same form as (16) we can conclude that ∂2ϕs/∂s2 is also analytic and asymptotically
tending to zero in the upper half plane. This procedure can be used to iteratively show that
all derivatives of ϕs have this property. Therefore if we start with a right–going wave in
vacuum and ‘evolve’ us such that stays analytic and asymptotically zero in the upper half
plane then the change in the permittivity will never generate any reﬂection.

One consequence of this analyticity is that, as in the case of the KdV hierarchy, on the
far left and far right of the proﬁle the ‘evolution’ equation (16) reduces to a local operation

at +∞ the operator ˆAs given in (4) depends on ‘s’ so that, except in restricted cases, the

we reproduce the ﬁnding that all proﬁles that satisfy this condition are invisible from one
side: they do not reﬂect for any angle of incidence and transmit without a phase shift [14, 15].
Moreover if such a proﬁle is evolved according to one of the equations in the KdV hierarchy
(see II B) then it remains analytic in one half plane and always satisﬁes the cancellation
condition, by virtue of the conservation law ∂s
proﬁles are analytic in one half plane means that they are always complex, and therefore
have balanced regions where the wave is absorbed and ampliﬁed (recent work on parity–time
symmetric materials [24] has seen experimental realisations of such media [25, 26]).

The simple transformation of the reﬂection coeﬃcients given by (5) enables us to use the
evolution equations of the preceding sections to design complex permittivity proﬁles with
prescribed reﬂection coeﬃcients.

A. Reﬂectionless planar media

In the case of real proﬁles it is well known that the solitons of the KdV hierarchy are
reﬂectionless for all angles of incidence [10, 27, 28] (the reﬂectionless P¨oschl–Teller proﬁle [29]
is a soliton in the KdV hierarchy). This is because a soliton moves at a constant velocity
without changing shape. Therefore it’s evolution is simultaneously governed by both the

of the three diﬀerent classes of proﬁle. In each case the blue line in the upper panel shows the
path traced out in us space by (20) with the background colour and arrows indicating the value
of ∂us/∂x and the red dot showing us(0) (note that the jumps in the background colour indicate
branch cuts): (a) here the three roots of (20) coincide u1 = u2 = u3 = 0.5, which is the complex
proﬁle us(x) = u1 − 2/[k2
0(x + ix0)2], that exhibits a mixture of both loss and gain (see [13] and the
appendix of [15] for a discussion of this particular proﬁle and its practical limitations). Inset in the
lower plot is a logarithmic plot of the reﬂection coeﬃcient as a function of angle; (b) two of the three
roots coincide u1 = u2 = 0.5 and u3 = 1.5 + 0.7i in this case resulting in a relatively complicated
path in u space that in general gives rise to quite irregular—although invisible—proﬁles; (c) all
three roots are distinct and real u1 = 0.29, u2 = 0.3, u3 = 1.5 resulting in a real valued periodic
medium (period L = 1.55λ) in the form of a cnoidal wave [10].

symmetries of sections II A and II B. But the reﬂection coeﬃcient cannot evolve according
to both (9) and (13) except if it is zero for all ky. The same argument can also be carried
out to derive complex permittivity proﬁles that have zero reﬂection coeﬃcient from both
sides, for all angles of incidence.
If we demand that the solution to the KdV equation
(11) translates in space at uniform velocity V over ‘time’ s then the resulting proﬁle will
be reﬂectionless from both sides and have unit transmission, for all angles of incidence.
Substituting us = us(x + V t) we ﬁnd that such a proﬁle is a solution to

where κ1 and κ2 are integration constants. In general the solution to the integral (20) can
be written in terms of elliptic functions [10], but we shall not use this representation here.
Although there has been quite a lot done to understand the properties of the complex
KdV equation (e.g. [30, 31]), the complex solutions of this equation do not seem to have
been widely examined for their properties as inhomogeneous optical media. In fact, with
the freedom to choose us(0), the velocity, and the two integration constants, (20) deﬁnes a
large number of reﬂectionless complex permittivity proﬁles that include the soliton proﬁles
as a special case. The diﬀerent proﬁles that are described by (20) can be divided up into
three kinds based on the coincidence of the roots in (21); (i) u1 = u2 = u3, where the
medium is complex and us(x) tends to the constant u1 at inﬁnity; (ii) u1 = u2 (cid:54)= u3 where
the spatial extent of the proﬁle depends on the argument of u1 − u3, e.g.
it is an inﬁnite
periodic medium when arg(u1 − u3) = 0, and conﬁned to a ﬁnite region of space when
arg(u1 − u3) = π; and (iii) u1 (cid:54)= u2 (cid:54)= u3, which is a medium of inﬁnite extent and may not
be periodic. Figure 4 shows instances of each of these cases, demonstrating the ultra low
reﬂectivity of two conﬁned proﬁles and the lack of any band gap (as a function of angle) for
a periodic medium. A very peculiar feature of all of these proﬁles is that they retain their
zero reﬂectivity and unit transmissivity as the angle of incidence is varied (which amounts
to varying the wavelength inside the medium), but not as the frequency is varied. This is
exempliﬁed in the ﬁnal example of ﬁgure 4 where—at a ﬁxed frequency—the ‘cnoidal Bragg
mirror’ exhibits no band gap as a function of angle, while if the frequency is varied from the
chosen value a band gap does in general appear.

B. Reducing the reﬂection from an interface

The evolution equations discussed above can also be used to diminish reﬂection from
a proﬁle. Suppose we have some given inhomogeneous medium and want to reduce its
reﬂection for all angles. To be concrete let us suppose a smoothed out step function

U0
2

u0(x) =

[1 + tanh(x/σ)]

(22)
which represents a material (x) = 1 + u0(x) that is vacuum at x → −∞ and has constant
permittivity 1 + U0 at x → +∞, with the transition between the two occurring over a length
scale σ around x = 0. It is often practically useful to reduce the reﬂection of a wave for a
range of angles as it passes from one medium to another, while keeping the length scale of
the transition constant. Here we use the above theory to suggest some ways of doing this.
As we have already shown, the reﬂection coeﬃcient changes by an exponential factor
under translation (9), or evolution by the KdV hierarchy (13). For real values of the param-
eters this factor is simply a phase shift, leaving the reﬂectivity |r|2 unaﬀected. Meanwhile

11

FIG. 5: If the KdV equation is applied to evolve an initially permittivity proﬁle for an imaginary
‘time’ interval s = iτ then the reﬂection from the proﬁle will exponentially diminish or increase,
depending on the sign of τ : rs = exp (−8ak3
xτ )r0. For small τ the permittivity simply acquires
an additional imaginary part; (a) A smoothed out step proﬁle acquires the imaginary part given
in (23), here shown for τ = 0.2; (b) The natural logarithm of the reﬂection coeﬃcient plotted
for increasing τ . Superimposed is the dashed line showing the predicted decrease of reﬂectivity
log(rs) = log(r0)− 8ak3
xτ , which in this case is only expected to hold for small τ ; (c) The logarithm
of the reﬂectivity plotted as a function of both the angle of incidence and τ . As is evident from
(13), the exponential decrease in the reﬂectivity falls oﬀ as cos3(θ) as we move away from normal
incidence.

for complex values of e.g.
‘time’ s, the reﬂection is exponentially increased or diminished.
For example, simply translating (22) by an imaginary distance u0(x) → u0(x + ix0) will
change the reﬂection coeﬃcient according to (9): rs = r0 exp(2kxx0). This alters the form
of the proﬁle around x = 0, continuously diminishing or amplifying the reﬂection until
x0 = ±πσ/2 when one of the poles of the hyperbolic tangent is encountered, causing a jump
in the reﬂectivity [15]. For this particular proﬁle we can therefore diminish the reﬂection by
at most a factor of exp(−2πkxσ) through translation, which requires gain in the material
parameters. Despite this practical limitation, this method of translating the proﬁle by an
imaginary distance to modify the scattering properties is promising, and may be similarly

12

applied to two and three dimensional inhomogeneous proﬁles.

Now consider evolution of (22) by the third order KdV equation (11), for simplicity over a
short period of imaginary ‘time’ s = iτ . This results in a complex proﬁle with an imaginary
part in addition to the real part (22),

and has a reﬂection coeﬃcient which is diminished by a factor of exp(−8ak3
xτ ) (see ﬁgure 5),
although we must remember that τ is restricted to take values such that the imaginary
part of (23) is much smaller than the real part [33].
In the limit of a sharp interface,
1/σ2 (cid:28) 3k2
0U0/2 the imaginary part of (23) takes negative values, requiring the medium to
have gain. Meanwhile in the opposite limit of a slowly graded interface 1/σ2 (cid:29) 3k2
0U0/2,
the imaginary part is always positive. The crossover between these two cases occurs when
σ = 2k−1
U0, which is the smallest scale of transition where
gain is not required in the material. This distributed loss must be implemented quite
precisely in order to have the desired eﬀect.

IV. SUMMARY

There is a fascinating link between the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation of ﬂuid dy-
namics and the time independent Schr¨odinger equation: if the potential in the Schr¨odinger
equation is ‘evolved’ subject to the KdV equation then the reﬂectivity as a function of energy
remains unchanged for every snapshot in ‘time’. In the above work we have investigated the
equivalent of this relationship for an electromagnetic wave propagating through an inhomo-
geneous slab of dielectric material, where the invariance of the reﬂectivity as a function of
energy translates into invariance as a function of angle, for a ﬁxed frequency.

The relationship between the KdV equation and the reﬂectivity of an inhomogeneous slab
was derived using an alternative method to the usual operator one, where we considered the
radiation due to the current induced in the material when the permittivity is changed by a
small amount. Through demanding that this additional radiation change the ﬁeld at x in a
way that depends only the ﬁeld inﬁnitesimally close to x we derived the ﬁrst two equations of
the KdV hierarchy, as well as the Kramers–Kronig media recently considered in [12–15]. It
may be that this provides an diﬀerent physical picture of the link between the KdV hierarchy
and wave propagation through inhomogeneous media.

There is much more freedom to manipulate the reﬂectivity of a medium if the permittivity
is allowed to take complex values. Using an exact solution of the KdV equation (a limiting
case of which is the P¨oschl–Teller potential) we found a very large class of both bounded and
unbounded complex permittivity proﬁles that do not reﬂect from either side, for any angle
of incidence, verifying this numerically. In the special case of the periodic ‘cnoidal wave’
solution to the KdV equation we found that the non–reﬂection property translates into there
being a real value of the Bloch vector for all angles of propagation. Finally we applied the
evolution equations discussed in the ﬁrst part of the paper to reduce the reﬂection of a wave
from an interface, where the permittivity is rapidly increased from one constant value to
another. In this case the KdV equation can be used to ﬁnd a distribution of the dissipative

13

response that must be added to the interface in order that the reﬂectivity is decreased for
all angles of incidence (although this reduction is much less for the angles far away from
normal incidence).

The overall purpose of this paper has been twofold: ﬁrstly to show that knowledge of
the relationship between the KdV hierarchy and the Helmholtz equation can be a useful
addition to existing design tools such as transformation optics, and provides another method
for controlling scattering from complex inhomogeneous media. The second purpose is to
propose that metamaterials may be suitable for experimentally investigating the equivalence
of scattering for media that have been ‘evolved’ according to the KdV equation, a beautiful
connection that has not yet been practically demonstrated.
