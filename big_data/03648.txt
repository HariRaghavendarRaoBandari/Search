Abstract

Taking the cue from experiments on actin growth on spherical
beads, we formulate and solve a model problem describing the ac-
cretion of an incompressible elastic solid on a rigid sphere due to at-
tachment of diﬀusing free particles. One of the peculiar characteristics
of this problem is that accretion takes place on the interior surface that
separates the body from its support rather than on its exterior surface,
and hence is responsible for stress accumulation. Simultaneously, ab-
lation takes place at the outer surface where material is removed from
the body. As the body grows, mechanical eﬀects associated with the
build-up of stress and strain energy slow down accretion and promote
ablation. Eventually, the system reaches a point where internal accre-
tion is balanced by external ablation. The present study is concerned
with this stationary regime called “treadmilling”.

The principal ingredients of our model are: a nonstandard choice
of the reference conﬁguration, which allows us to cope with the contin-
ually evolving material structure; and a driving force and a kinetic law

1

for accretion/ablation that involves the diﬀerence in chemical poten-
tial, strain energy and the radial stress. By combining these ingredients
we arrive at an algebraic system which governs the stationary tread-
milling state. We establish the conditions under which this system has
a solution and we show that this solution is unique. Moreover, by an
asymptotic analysis we show that for small beads the thickness of the
solid is proportional to the radius of the support and is strongly af-
fected by the stiﬀness of the solid, whereas for large beads the stiﬀness
of the solid is essentially irrelevant, the thickness being proportional
to a characteristic length that depends on the parameters that govern
diﬀusion and accretion kinetics.

Keywords: Accretion, diﬀusion, chemical potential, kinetic equations,

stress-free reference conﬁguration, treadmilling.

1 Introduction.

Surface growth, i.e. the accretion of a solid onto a surface, occurs in sev-
eral contexts of physical, technological, and biological interest. One of the
most common examples of surface growth is the solidiﬁcation of water at
the ice-water interface near the freezing temperature; other examples include
technological processes such as chemical vapor deposition or, in biology, the
growth of hard tissues like bones and teeth.

Although surface growth may be regarded as bulk growth concentrated
on a surface [14], surface and bulk growth are in general treated in a dif-
ferent manner. When dealing with bulk growth, the reference conﬁguration
is ﬁxed and the addition of particles to the body is accounted for by a ten-
sor ﬁeld, often referred to as the growth tensor [27], whose value at a given
point identiﬁes the stress-free stance [15] of a chunk of material in a small
neighborhood of that point. When dealing with surface growth, on the other
hand, it seems more natural to account for addition and removal of material
by letting the boundary of the reference conﬁguration evolve, as done in [29].
The choice of a reference conﬁguration in bulk growth is rarely an issue:
in fact, because of the extra degree of freedom brought in by the growth ten-
sor, there is always a pair of a deformation and of a growth-tensor ﬁeld that
identiﬁes a stress-free state.For surface growth, on the contrary, it is not al-
ways obvious what is the most convenient choice of a reference conﬁguration.
In particular, it might be impossible to identify a stress-free state through
the conventional notion of reference conﬁguration in a three-dimensional ref-
erence space. From the kinematic standpoint, a resolution to this diﬃculty

2

was provided by Skalak et al.
[28] in a seminal paper by introducing the
time τ at which a material point is deposited on the growth surface. They
label each particle of the body at time t with four coordinates (a1, a2, τ, t),
where (a1, a2) are the coordinates of the point on the two-dimensional growth
surface at which the material point was deposited. It is this basic idea that
we build upon in our developments.

Another important feature of surface growth is the dependence of the
accretion rate on the local stress ﬁeld. Often, accretion happens at the outer
surface of the body, with each new layer of material forming on top of the
layer that was last formed.
If each new layer is geometrically compatible
with the previous one, accretion does not lead to a build-up of stress. On
the other hand if accretion occurs on an interior surface of the body, and
each new layer of material has to push away the previous layer, then this
necessarily generates a residual stress in the body. The stress ﬁeld, by its
turn, appears in the laws governing accretion rate through an Eshelbian-like
coupling term [4, 10, 15, 18]. All these eﬀects result into an intimate coupling
between mechanics and growth.

Figure 1: Problem setting: An annular solid body B, bounded by two concentric spherical
surfaces Σ0 and Σ1(t). The former represents the ﬁxed support at which accretion occurs,
the later is the (in general) time-dependent outer surface of the body. A ﬂuid containing
“free particles” ﬁlls the entire region outside Σ0, and therefore surrounds and permeates
the solid. The free particles diﬀuse through the solid to reach its inner surface Σ0 where
they attach to the solid. Free particles are continually being attached to the body at the
inner surface and detached from the body at the outer surface.

3

The speciﬁc problem we consider is described schematically in Figure 1.
A note on terminology ﬁrst: since we wish to refer to the individual units of
material that combine to form a body, it is convenient to refer:to any such
unit as a “free particle”; to the body formed by the combination of many
free particles as the “solid”; to the processes of adding and removing free
particles from the solid as “accretion” and “ablation”, respectively. In Figure
1 the solid body B occupies the region between the two spherical surfaces
Σ0 and Σ1(t). The inner surface Σ0 is the boundary of a rigid bead on
whose surface accretion occurs. The bead is surrounded by a ﬂuid in which
the free particles are dispersed, the ﬂuid occupying the entire region outside
Σ0, wherefore it both surrounds and permeates the solid. The free particles
diﬀuse towards the bead surface due to a gradient in chemical potential.
When they arrive at Σ0 they attach to B. At the same time, it turns out
that it is energetically favorable for the solid to shed free particles at its
outer surface Σ1(t), wherefore ablation occurs simultaneously at Σ1(t). Thus
free particles are continually being attached and detached from the body, the
former at the inner surface and the latter at the outer surface. If the rate of
accretion is greater than the rate of ablation, the body grows and Σ1(t) moves
outwards. The evolving stress and deformation ﬁelds within the solid are
governed by a mechanics problem. The ﬂow of free particles is governed by a
diﬀusion problem. And these two problems are coupled at the two surfaces of
the body through both the conservation of free particles and the kinetics of
accretion (when there is no ambiguity, as in the preceding sentence, we shall
use the term accretion to refer to both accretion at the inner surface and
ablation at the outer surface). We study the steady “treadmilling” problem
where the accretion rate balances the ablation rate so that the outer radius
of the body is in fact time-independent (even though free particles continue
to attach and detach at the two surfaces).

Although our aim is to illustrate certain ideas in continuum mechanics,
the problem we consider was inspired by an experiment described by Noireaux
et al.
[26] (see also [9]). In this experiment, a polymeric gel is grown on a
spherical bead by immersing it in a solution containing actin, a protein which
can polymerize and form ﬁlaments entangled and cross-linked into an elastic
network [31]. Previous chemical treatment of the bead’s surface ensures that
actin polymerization — and hence accretion of the network — takes place on
that surface; moreover, the permeability of the network to the surrounding
solution makes it possible for the actin units in the solvent to diﬀuse towards
the bead’s surface, where they polymerize and attach to the network. The
results reported in [26] show the existence of a treadmilling state

There is a vast and rapidly growing body of literature on the mechanics of

4

growth which we shall not attempt to review here. The reader is referred to,
for example, the review papers by Ambrosi et al.[3], Garikipati [20], Jones
and Chapman [22], Kuhl [23], Menzel and Kuhl [24], and Taber [30], and
to the book by Epstein [17]. Examples with residual stresses induced in
an elastic solid by volumetric growth in spherical symmetry may be found
in [5], [6], and [25]. An example involving surface growth is discussed in
[10]. Concerning the aforementioned experiments, by which our problem was
inspired, Noireaux et al.
[26] examined this problem using linear elasticity.
Dafalias and Pitouras [13] examined the mechanics aspects of this problem
using particular ﬁnite elasticity constitutive models; see also [12, 16]. A
more recent study by Cohen et al.
[11] considered the eﬀect of dampening
(resulting from the interaction between the solid matrix and the solvent ﬂow)
and investigated the time-dependent evolution of the system leading to the
treadmilling regime.

The principal contributions of the present paper consist in: the intro-
duction of the notion of a four-dimensional reference space in characterizing
surface growth; a ﬁnite deformation analysis of the mechanical problem for
an arbitrary isotropic elastic body; the coupling of the chemical problem to
the ﬁnite deformation mechanics problem; showing that it is the build-up of
strain energy, not stress, that causes the ablation rate at the outer surface
to increase as the body grows; and the development of a thermodynamically
consistent notion of the driving force for accretion that explicitly accounts
for energy, stress and chemical potential.

In Section 2 we formulate and solve the ﬁnite deformation mechanics
problem for the elastic solid B. This problem is coupled to the free particle
diﬀusion problem in two ways. One is by the conservation of mass as the free
particles are attached and detached from the solid body. This is addressed in
Section 3. Then in Section 4 we model the steady diﬀusion of free particles.
The preceding eﬀects are further coupled through the kinetics of accretion.
This is formulated in Section 5 where, in particular, we develop the notion of
the driving force for accretion. We assume that the deviations from thermo-
dynamical equilibrium are small, and take a linear kinetic relation between
driving force and accretion rate. Finally in Section 6 we study the steady
response of the system, establishing precise conditions under which this sys-
tem can have a treadmilling solution, and then examining in more detail
the thickness of the body and the accretion rate in the limiting cases of a
small bead (the stress–limited regime) and a large bead (the diﬀusion–limited
regime). The implications of the results are discussed in Section 7 and we
end with a brief summary.

2 Mechanics of the solid body.

In this section we ﬁrst propose a notion of reference conﬁguration, defor-
mation and strain for the solid body. Then, we determine the stress ﬁeld
and the strain energy density within the body manifold B(t), namely, the
region occupied by the body at time t in the physical space. The ingredi-
ents of our construction are: a three-dimensional material manifold M(t)
whose elements identify the material points that comprise the body at time
t, the manifold M(t) being immersed in a four-dimensional reference space;
a placement map χ(·, t) which assigns to the typical particle X ∈ M(t) the
position x = χ(X, t) that the particle occupies at time t; a constitutive
equation relating the deformation gradient and the stress.
The physical space. We shall identify with R3 the physical space where
the motion takes place. Under the present circumstances, it is natural to
label points in the physical space by spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) such that
a typical point is represented by

x = x(r, θ, φ) := (r cos θ cos φ, r sin θ cos φ, r sin φ) .

(1)
The body occupies the region between two concentric spherical surfaces Σ0
and Σ1, so that for r = r0 and r = r1, x lies on, respectively, the inner
boundary Σ0 and the outer boundary Σ1. For later use, we introduce the
following orthonormal basis

er :=

∂x
∂r

,

eθ :=

1
r

∂x
∂θ

,

eφ :=

1
r

∂x
∂φ

.

(2)

In order to unambiguously identify individual particles during their mo-
tion in physical space, we now introduce a material manifold M(t) within a
reference space.

The reference space. Surface growth involves two uncommon features that
need some attention: (i) the material manifold M(t) does not constitute a
ﬁxed collection of material points and (ii) as we shall see in what follows,
the solid material is formed in physical space under stressed conditions and
the material accumulates residual stresses such that, even when the support
is removed, the grown body is not stress-free. The choice of the particular
material manifold and reference space is made so as to model these eﬀects as
simply as possible.

Given that particles are sequentially added to the body at the inner sur-

face Σ0, we choose, as material manifold, the Cartesian product

M(t) = Σ0 × (Z0(t), Z1(t))

(3)

6

between the constant spherical surface Σ0 on which accretion occurs and an
open, time–varying interval (Z0(t), Z1(t)). The set deﬁned in (3) is a smooth
submanifold of a four-dimensional reference space R4:

M(t) ⊂ R4.

(4)

This material manifold is in fact a cylindrical hypersurface parallel to the
axis Z, each cross section being a copy of the surface Σ0 on which accretion
takes place. Although both B(t) and M(t) may depend on time, hereafter
we shall omit such dependence when there is no risk of confusion.

In order to gain some intuitive understanding of the material manifold, it
is helpful to consider the analogous lower dimensional problem where growth
takes place on a circular ring in a two-dimensional space as illustrated in
Figure 2(a). The body manifold B(t) in physical space is therefore a circular
annular disc with inner and outer radii r0 and r1(t). The material manifold
M in reference space, deﬁned by (3) and shown schematically in Figure
2(b), is a cylinder in three-dimensional space.
Its ends, Z = Z0(t) and
Z = Z1(t) (or Γ0(t) and Γ1(t) in Figure 2(b)), correspond to the respective
boundaries Σ0 and Σ1(t) in physical space. Since new material is continually
being added at Σ0 and removed at Σ1, the ends of the cylinder M in the
material manifold will be time dependent in general and the cylinder may
change its length. As depicted by the arrows in Figure 2(b), when material
is being added at Γ0, the boundary Γ0 must translate parallel to the Z-axis
along the negative direction so as to incorporate new material points into M;
similarly when material is being lost at Γ1, the boundary Γ1 must translate
in the negative Z-direction so that material points are removed from M.
The rate at which material is added at Σ0, as characterized by the motion of
Γ0 in reference space, is therefore given by −2πr0
˙Z0(t). Similarly the rate at
which material is removed at Σ1 is −2πr0
˙Z1(t). Thus, for example, the rate
at which the incompressible body expands in physical space, 2πr1 ˙r1(t) must
equal −2πr0
˙Z1(t). We will encounter analogous expressions in
our higher dimensional problem.
It is worth emphasizing that in physical
space, even though the radius r0 of the inner surface is constant, the radial
velocity of the material points at r = r0 does not vanish. In fact the radial
velocity is − ˙Z0, as can be deduced from the fact that the rate of material
addition at r = r0 is −2πr0

˙Z0(t) + 2πr0

˙Z0(t).

Returning to our (higher dimensional) setting, it is natural to describe

the material manifold through the parametric characterization

X = X(Θ, Φ, Z) := (r0 cos Θ cos Φ, r0 sin Θ cos Φ, r0 sin Φ, Z),

(5)

where 0 ≤ Θ < 2π, 0 ≤ Φ ≤ π, Z0 ≤ Z ≤ Z1.

7

We interpret the coordinates (Θ, Φ, Z) of the typical point X as follows:
• the pair (Θ, Φ) speciﬁes where on Σ0 the particle X was added to the

body;

• The variable Z identiﬁes a section of the cylinder (a sphere of radius r0)
comprising all material points added to the body at the same instant.
We denote the corresponding time by t0(Z).

In our construction the variable Z shall specify the (reverse) order in which
material points are added to the material manifold: if two material particles,
say Xa and Xb belong to sections Za and Zb with Za < Zb, then Xa has
been added to the body after Xb. In particular the section Z0(t) contains all
material points added to the body at time t.

As mentioned in the introduction, our choice in labeling material points is
inspired by the proposal set forth in [28] (see also [29]), where it was suggested
that the collection of material points that comprise a growing body at time
t be labeled through a triplet of coordinates (θ1, θ2, τ ), with τ ≤ t denoting
the time at which a particular point was added to the body. In our case,
however, the fourth coordinate Z cannot be identiﬁed with the time t0(Z)
when a free particle attaches to the body.

For later use, we introduce the normalized orthogonal basis associated

with the coordinate system (Θ, Φ, Z) on M

eΘ := r0

eΦ := r0

(6)

The placement map and its gradient. We may specify the placement of
the body in the physical space R3 through a placement map χ(·, t) : M(t) →
R3 which assigns a place

(7)
to the typical particle X = X(Φ, Θ, Z). The time dependence is due to
growth. A natural characterization of the placement map from the material
coordinates (Z, Θ, Φ) to the spatial coordinates (r, θ, φ) is

x(t) = χ(X, t)

χ(X, t) = x(r(Θ, Φ, Z, t), θ(Θ, Φ, Z, t), φ(Θ, Φ, Z, t))

(8)

where x(r, θ, φ), was deﬁned in (3).

By making use of the chain rule we can now write the deformation gradient

of the mapping from M(t) to B(t) as

Figure 2: Schematic depiction of the body manifold B and the material
manifold M at a given time t in the case of a two dimensional physical
space. The annular disk on the left-hand side represents the body manifold
while the cylinder on the right-hand side is the material manifold. The radius
r0 of the cylinder equals the inner radius of the annular region. The two ends
of the cylinder, Γ0 and Γ1, can move in the vertical direction thus adding or
removing material points to M.

Spherical symmetry. Looking for spherically-symmetric solutions, we now
restrict attention to placement maps such that r(Θ, Φ, Z, t) is independent of
Θ and Φ, and that, trivially, θ(Θ, Φ, Z, t) = Θ and φ(Θ, Φ, Z, t) = Φ. Thus
(10)
Put in another way, equation (10) states that the particle that is added to the
body at location (r0, θ, φ) at time t0(Z) is located, at time t, at (r(Z, t), θ, φ).
In particular, the particles occupying the positions (r0, θ, φ) and (r1, θ, φ)
belong to the sections Z0(t) and Z1(t) and so we additionally require that

r = r(Z, t),

θ = Θ,

φ = Φ.

r(Z0(t), t) = r0

and

r(Z1(t), t) = r1(t).

(11)

On account of (10), the representation (8) of the placement map becomes

and the deformation gradient (9) specializes to

χ(X, t) = x(r(Z, t), Θ, Φ)

(14)

It is worth noting that in the classical elasticity problem (without growth) of
the radial deformation of a spherical shell, if one identiﬁes Z with the radial
coordinate of a particle in the undeformed conﬁguration, then the principal
stretches would be λr = ∂r/∂Z and λθ = r/Z the latter of which diﬀers from
(14)2.

Integrating (16) and enforcing the ﬁrst of (11) yields

This equation gives, explicitly, the radial coordinate r at time t of a particle
that was added to the solid body at time t0(Z). Diﬀerentiating (17) with
respect to t at constant (“reference coordinate”) Z, gives the particle velocity
ﬁeld of the solid body:

(18)

The divergence of this velocity ﬁeld is readily seen to vanish in keeping with
the requirement of incompressibility. Observe also that the speed of a mate-
rial point on the growth surface is v(r0, t) = − ˙Z0(t) and this does not vanish
in general, even though the support is rigid and r0 is independent of time.
This is a consequence of the growth that occurs at r = r0.

Observe from (17) and (11)2 that r3

The left hand side of this equation characterizes the rate at which the volume
of the body increases. The two terms on the right hand side represent the
rates at which material is added to the body at Σ0 and removed at Σ1; this

10

is precisely the higher dimensional counterpart of the equation presented in
the paragraph above (5) in our discussion of the lower dimensional case.
The importance of (19) is that we will encounter the two terms on its right
hand side when we model the ﬂux of free particles and their kinetics during
addition to, and removal from, the body.

Material response: energy and stress. Assume now that the incom-
pressible solid can be modeled as an isotropic elastic material. As such,

it can be characterized through a referential strain energy function(cid:102)W (F) =
(cid:99)W (λ1, λ2, λ3) where the symbols λi denote the principal stretches; We assume
that (cid:99)W and its ﬁrst derivatives vanish for λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = 1. The principal

Cauchy stress components are then given by the constitutive equation

σk = λk(cid:99)Wk − p,

(cid:99)Wk = ∂(cid:99)W /∂λk,

k = 1, 2, 3,

(20)

where the pressure p is constitutively indeterminate.

Since we are dealing with isochoric equi-biaxial deformations character-

ized by

λ1 = λ−2,

λ2 = λ,

λ3 = λ,

W (λ) :=(cid:99)W (λ−2, λ, λ),

it is convenient to introduce a reduced strain energy W (λ) deﬁned by

Our previous assumptions on(cid:99)W guarantee that W (1) = W (cid:48)(1) = 0.

λ > 0.

(21)

To examine the properties of the reduced strain energy function, consider
the principal Cauchy stress components in isochoric equi-biaxial deformations
under plane stress conditions, i.e. when σ1 = 0 and λ1 = λ−2, λ2 = λ, λ3 = λ.
These are readily calculated from (20) and (21) to be

σ1 = 0,

σ2 = σ3 := σ =

W (cid:48)(λ).

λ
2

(22)

It is natural to require the equi-biaxial stress σ to be tensile for λ > 1 and
compressive for 0 < λ < 1. Thus we shall endow W with the properties

W (cid:48)(λ) > 0 for λ > 1,

(23)
which in particular imply that W (λ) > 0 for λ (cid:54)= 0. In addition, we shall
require that the reduced energy blows up under extreme elastic strains:

W (cid:48)(λ) < 0 for 0 < λ < 1,

W (λ) → ∞ as λ → ∞.

(24)

This assumption, as we shall see later, ensures the existence of a treadmilling
state.

Equilibrium. On taking into account spherical symmetry, and on recalling
(26), we see that the equilibrium equation div σ = 0 has only one non-trivial
scalar consequence:

(σr − σθ) = 0.

Now, by making use of the constitutive equation (20) and of the deﬁnition
0/r2 and
of W (λ) given in (21), and by noting from (14) and (15) that λr = r2
λθ = r/r0, we readily see that

σr − σθ = λr(cid:99)W1(λr, λθ, λθ) − λθ(cid:99)W2(λr, λθ, λθ) =
0/r2, r/r0, r/r0) − r/r0(cid:99)W2(r2

(30)

When applied to the problem analyzed in the present paper, we make the

identiﬁcation

so that the Cauchy stress is given by

λ = λθ = λφ,

σ = σrer ⊗ er + σθ (eθ ⊗ eθ + eφ ⊗ eφ) ,

where, in accordance with (20), the radial and the circumferential stress are
given by, respectively,

σr = λr(cid:99)W1(λr, λθ, λθ) − p,

and σθ = λθ(cid:99)W2(λr, λθ, λθ) − p.

(27)

Therefore, the equilibrium equation (28) takes the form

∂σr
∂r

=

1
r0

W (cid:48)(r/r0).

On integrating (30) with respect to r and on requiring that σr vanishes on
the outer surface Σ1 (i.e., for r = r1) we obtain an explicit expression for the
radial stress ﬁeld in the body

σr(r, t) = W (r/r0) − W (r1(t)/r0).

(31)

The circumferential stress σθ(r, t) can now be determined through (29). In
particular, by making use of (31) and (29), and by recalling that W (1) =

12

W (cid:48)(1) = 0, we can compute the Cauchy stress components at the inner
surface r = r0:

σr(r0, t) = σθ(r0, t) = −W (r1(t)/r0).

(32)

Observe from (32) that, at the inner boundary Σ0,

– the stress is hydrostatic;

– the radial and circumferential stresses are both compressive;

– the stress is, in general, time dependent due to its dependence on the

time varying outer radius r1(t);

– and, as one might expect, the magnitudes of the stress components

increase with the outer radius r1.

Thus material is added to the body (in physical space) at a hydrostatically
stressed state. In the steady (treadmilling) regime the radius r1 is constant,
and so the stress will also remain constant.

As for the circumferential stress at the outer surface, since σr(r1(t), t) = 0,

we have

by (29). The right-hand side of (33) is positive in view of our stipulation that
W (cid:48)(λ) be positive for λ > 1. Therefore the circumferential stress is tensile
at the outer surface while, as noted previously, it is compressive at the inner
surface.

Returning to equations (14) and (15) we observe that on the growth
surface r = r0 incompressibility implies λr = λθ = 1. However this does not
mean that the body is unstressed at r = r0 as is seen from (32).

In summary, the radial velocity ﬁeld v(r, t) in the solid is given by (18)
and the radial stress ﬁeld σr(r, t) is given by (31). These expressions involve
the as yet unknown outer radius r1(t) and the velocity ˙Z0(t) of the material
points at the inner surface r = r0. These functions depend on the accretion
rate, and this in turn depends on both the local concentration of free particles,
and the local stress and energy. This coupled chemo-mechanical process will
be treated in the next sections.

The numerical calculations in later sections will be carried out for a neo-

Hookean material characterized by the strain energy function

3 Conservation of mass.

As mentioned previously in Section 1, the elastic solid and surrounding ﬂuid,
exchange free particles at the surfaces Σ0 and Σ1. In the presence of spherical

14

4321–1–20.20.60.40.81.0symmetry, the free particles diﬀuse in the radially inward direction (due to a
chemical potential gradient as will be discussed in the next section). When
the diﬀusing free particles reach the inner surface Σ0 they are removed from
the ﬂuid and attached to the solid. Thus the incoming free particle ﬂux at
r = r0 is balanced by the rate of accretion of the solid. Similarly at the outer
surface Σ1, the inward ﬂow of free particles from the region outside the solid
body (r > r1) crosses this surface and continues as an inward radial ﬂow
of free particles. However, at r = r1, free particles are being removed from
the solid and added back into the ﬂuid. Thus the free particle ﬂux is not
continuous at r = r1 and its value will change discontinuously (jump) by an
amount equal to the rate of ablation of the solid.

We now formalize the preceding description by making the following ad-

ditional modeling choices:
(A1) the supply of mass added or removed from M is provided by a diﬀu-
sant dispersed in an incompressible ﬂuid that occupies the entire space
outside of Σ0;

(A2) particles can be added to and removed from the material manifold M

only at its boundary ∂M = Γ0 ∪ Γ1.

On account of (A1), we introduce a spatial scalar ﬁeld  and a spatial vector
ﬁeld h, deﬁned everywhere outside Σ0, and representing the density and ﬂux
of diﬀusant, respectively. Granted spherical symmetry, we may assume the
diﬀusant ﬂux to be radial,

(35)
where −h(r, t) is the mass of free particles that crosses a unit area of a
spherical surface of radius r, in the radially inward direction, in unit time.

h = h(r, t)er,

In order to link this ﬂux of free particles to the accretion rate we make

the following hypothesis:
(A3) in order to build-up a unit volume of M, the mass of free particles that

must be converted into solid particles is a positive constant R.

We ﬁrst enforce a balance between the ﬂux of free particles diﬀusing
through the ﬂuid and arriving at Σ0 and the rate at which they are added to
the solid through accretion. The mass of free particles arriving at Σ0 per unit
time is −4πr2
0h(r0, t). Since there are no free particles in the interior of Σ0,
this serves as the sole free particle supply to the material manifold at Γ0. We
next consider the material manifold. Since the outward normal velocity of its

15

boundary Γ0 is − ˙Z0(t) (see Figure 2(b)), the rate at which free particles are
0(− ˙Z0)R; see discussion surrounding (19). Mass
added to M at Γ0 is 4πr2
conservation requires this rate to equal the rate at which diﬀusant is lost
0(− ˙Z0)R.
from the ﬂuid at Σ0 and so we must have −4πr2
This leads to

0h(r0, t) = 4πr2

h(r0, t) = −RV0(t)

(36)

where we have introduced the accretion rate:
V0 := − ˙Z0,

at the inner surface.

(37)

Second we consider the corresponding issue at the outer surface. The
radially inward ﬂux of free particles increases discontinuously from −h(r1+, t)
to −h(r1−, t) as it crosses Σ1. This increase is due to the free-particle supply
resulting from ablation of the material manifold at Γ1. Now consider the
material manifold. Since the outward normal velocity of its boundary Γ1 is
˙Z1(t) (see Figure 2(b)), the rate at which material is removed from M at Γ1
is −4πr2
˙Z1R; see discussion surrounding (19). Mass conservation requires
−4πr2

1h(r1−, t)] − [−4πr2

1h(r1+, t)] which leads to

0

0

˙Z1R = [−4πr2

h(r1+, t) − h(r1−, t) = − (r0/r1)2 RV1(t),

where we have introduced

V1 := ˙Z1.

(38)

(39)

Finally, the following equation will be useful in what follows and so we

record it here: observe from (19), (37) and (39) that

1 ˙r1 = r2
r2

0(V1 + V0),

(40)

where ˙r1(t) is the rate of increase of the radius of the outer surface Σ1 of the
solid.

The pair of equations (36) and (38) characterize the conservation of free
particle mass during the accretive processes at r = r0 and r = r1 and couples
the mechanics problem to the diﬀusion problem. They involve the diﬀusant
ﬂuxes h(r0, t) and h(r1±, t), and the material manifold boundary velocities
V0 and V1. In order to proceed further we need additional information on
the ﬂuxes. Since the diﬀusant ﬂux is driven by a gradient of the chemical
potential, we now consider the role of the chemical potential in the diﬀusive
process.

16

4 Diﬀusion of free particles.

The conservation of free particles requires that the free particle density 
and the free particle ﬂux h obey the balance equation ˙ + div h = 0 away
from ∂B. In the simplest models of diﬀusion, the ﬂux is further assumed to
obey Fick’s law, h = −M∇µ, with the chemical potential µ being related
constitutively to  by an equation of state of the form µ = ϕ(cid:48)() where ϕ is
a free energy function. We shall simplify the analysis here by

(A4) limiting attention from hereon to steady state evolution processes where

all spatial ﬁelds are independent of time.

Since h = h(r)er under steady spherically symmetric conditions, the mass
balance equation simpliﬁes to

div h =

1
r2

∂
∂r

(r2h(r)) = 0.

(41)

Integrating this and enforcing mass balance through the requirements (36)

Next we take the ﬂux of free particles to obey Fick’s law and we allow

(A5) the scalar diﬀusion mobility M in Fick’s law to have diﬀerent (con-
stant) values, M− and M +, in the regions inside and outside the solid
respectively.

Thus we write h = −M∇µ in the explicit form

where we have used the fact that under steady spherically symmetric condi-
tions µ = µ(r). We shall assume that
(A6) µ(r) → µ∞ as r → ∞, with µ∞ a prescribed remote value of the

chemical potential.

(45)

Summarizing the results thus far: we are given the values of the remote
chemical potential µ∞, the inner radius r0, the reference density R and the
mobilities M±. Up to now, we have three equations at our disposal, namely,
(40), (45)1, and (45)2, which involve ﬁve unknown quantities: the chemical
potentials µ0, µ1, the accretion velocities V0, V1, and the outer radius r1. The
extra two equations needed to close the system will come from the kinetics
of accretion at Σ0 and Σ1 which we turn to next.

5 The kinetics of accretion.

In problems from continuum mechanics and materials science involving ac-
cretion of a body in the presence of deformation and mass transport, e.g.
the growth of a thin ﬁlm in contact with a vapor reservoir of atoms, it is
necessary to characterize the kinetics of the accretive prosess. From a ther-
modynamic point of view accretion is in general a non-equilibrium process,
and therefore involves a driving force (which is a measure of the departure
from equilibrium) and a conjugate ﬂux. Following Abeyaratne and Knowles
[1, 2] the appropriate driving force is determined by calculating the dissipa-
tion rate (or more generally the entropy production rate). Thermodynamic
equilibrium corresponds to the vanishing of the driving force (often called the
“Maxwell condition”). One simple model of a kinetic law is a linear relation
between the driving force and the conjugate ﬂux, presumably appropriate
for small departures from equilibrium. For a general discussion of thermody-
namics forces, conjugate ﬂuxes and the kinetics of nonequilibrium processes
the reader is referred to Chapter 14 of Kestin [7] or Chapter 14 of Callen [8].

18

Driving force and linear kinetics. In the present setting, the total dissi-
pation rate is

∆ = external mechanical power

+ inﬂow of chemical energy per unit time
− d
dt

(strain energy).

When body forces vanish, the only external mechanical power that must be
accounted for is expended by the traction applied to the boundary of the
body. Accordingly, we set

external mechanical power =

SnR · V dA.

(46)

(cid:90)

∂M(t)

Here nR is the outward unit normal on the boundary of the material manifold.
With regard to the velocity, it is important to note that the velocity of the
boundary diﬀers from the velocity of a particle that happens to be at the
boundary. The velocity of the boundary V is deﬁned as follows: consider
a time-dependent material point Xb(t) which belongs to ∂M(t) and whose
time derivative ˙Xb is parallel to nR; then ˙Xb = V nR with V the outward
velocity of ∂M(t); we let V = d
dt χ(Xb(t), t) or, equivalently, by the chain
rule,

where we recall that v = ˙χ is the velocity of the material point Xb(t).

V = v + V FnR,

Next we write the external chemical power as the product of the chemical
energy required to convert a unit mass of free particles into bound particles
bounded to the body, multiplied by the rate at which mass is added to the
body. In accordance with this notion, we set

(47)

inﬂow of chemical energy per unit time =

R(µ − µR)V dA,

(48)

(cid:90)

∂M(t)

where we interpret µR as the amount of energy needed to assemble a unit
mass of solid material.

We now can write the total dissipation rate as:

∆ =

∂M(t)

SnR · V dA +

R(µ− µR)V dA− d
dt

∂M(t)

W (F) dV. (49)

M(t)

By making use of standard divergence and transport theorems we rewrite the
dissipation rate in the equivalent form

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

∆ =

∂M(t)

[ SnR · FnR − (W (F) − (µ − µR)R)] V dA.

(50)

19

Therefore in settings where surface accretion is the only nonequilibrium pro-
cess we may identify

f = SnR · FnR − (W (F) − (µ − µR)R)

(51)

with the driving force on the surface of accretion and V as its conjugate
ﬂux. An accretive process is characterized by a kinetic relation between the
ﬂux, the driving force, and possibly other local ﬁelds: V = V (f, . . .). In the
simplest case, when the departure from thermodynamic equilibrium is small,
one has a linear kinetic relation

f = bV

(52)

where the constant b is a positive kinetic modulus. This is to hold at all
points at which accretion occurs.

The paper [33], which focuses on a one-dimensional treadmilling struc-
ture, follows an approach similar to ours in the deduction of the evolution law
governing boundary accretion. In particular, Eq. (5) in that paper is based
on balance between dissipation, mechanical work, and supply of chemical
energy. Alternatively, the equation governing accretion may be arrived at by
making use of the notion of conﬁgurational or material force [10, 19, 21].
Specialization to the problem at hand. At this point we make the
following modeling choices pertaining to the boundary ∂M of the material
manifold:

(A7) we take the kinetic relation to be linear and allow the kinetic moduli

of the two parts Γ0 and Γ1 of the boundary to be diﬀerent; and

(A8) we allow the referential chemical potentials at Γ0 and Γ1 to be diﬀerent.

Accordingly we denote by b0 (> 0), b1 (> 0) and µR,0, µR,1 the respective values
of the kinetic modulus and referential chemical potential at Γ0, Γ1. Thus
we are distinguishing between the energetics and kinetics of the addition of
material at Γ0 and the removal of material at Γ1. It is worth pointing out
that, in the notation used here, the free particles have chemical potential µ0
just before they attach to the body and µR,0 soon after; and likewise they
have chemical potential µ1 soon after they detach from the body and µR,1
just before. Thus, µR,0 − µ0 and µ1 − µR,1 are the respective changes in
chemical energy during accretion and ablation. We interpret the quantity
µR as the energetic cost of adding a unit mass of material to the body, that
is, the cost of accretion. As we shall see below, this extra energetic term
substantially aﬀects the evolution of growth. This point is also discussed in

20

the paper [32], which contains other examples on how the cost of accretion
may be relevant to the kinetics of growth.

In the speciﬁc problem at hand, we recall that the outward unit normal

nR to ∂M is (cf. Figure 2):

(cid:40)−eZ

eZ

nR(X, t) =

for X ∈ Γ0(t),
for X ∈ Γ1(t).

(53)

As encountered previously in (37) and (39), the outward normal velocities of
points of the boundaries Γ0 and Γ1 are V0nR and V1nR. Therefore we take
the kinetic equations at Γ0 and Γ1 to be

f0 = b0V0,

f1 = b1V1,

(54)

where, as we show below, the driving forces, f0 and f1, on the respective
boundaries Γ0 and Γ1 of the material manifold, are

and

(55a)

f0 = (µ0 − µR,0)R − W(cid:0)r1/r0
f1 = (µ1 − µR,1)R − W(cid:0)r1/r0

(cid:1),
(cid:1).

Here W (λ) is the restriction of the strain energy function (cid:99)W (λ1, λ2, λ3) to

(55b)

isochoric equi-biaxial deformations as introduced previously in (21).

It is noteworthy that, even though the same term W (r1/r0) appears in
both (55a) and (55b), it originates from diﬀerent contributions in the general
expression for driving force: in the expression for the driving force f0 on Γ0,
it appears from the ﬁrst term in (51), the term related to stress; see (32).
On the other hand in the expression for the driving force f1 on Γ1, it appears
from the second term in (51) related to the free energy.

Derivation of the expression (55a) for the driving force on Γ0: By (14) and
(16), the principal stretches at Γ0 are λr(r0) = λθ(r0) = 1 and hence

The strain energy at Γ0, (cid:99)W (1, 1, 1), vanishes, and the free energy therefore

= eθ ⊗ eΘ + eφ ⊗ eΦ + er ⊗ eZ.

(56)

F(cid:12)(cid:12)Γ0

contains only a chemical contribution:

Next, from (56) and (53),

ψ|Γ0 = µR,0R.

(FnR)(cid:12)(cid:12)Γ0

= F(cid:12)(cid:12)Γ0

21

(−eZ) = er,

(57)

(58)

and by making use of (32), S = det F σF−T and det F = 1, we ﬁnd that

(FnR · SnR)(cid:12)(cid:12)Γ0

= (er · σer)(cid:12)(cid:12)Σ0

= σr(r0, t) = −W (r1/r0).

(59)

Then substituting (57) and (59) into (51) gives (55a).

Derivation of the expression (55b) for the driving force on Γ1: It is readily seen
from (14)2 and (15) that

and so from (21)

λr(r1) = r2

0/r2
1,

(cid:99)W (λ1, λ2, λ3)(cid:12)(cid:12)Γ1

λθ(r1) = r1/r0,

= W (r1/r0).

(60)

(61)

Since the surface Γ1 is traction free, we have

(FnR · SFnR)(cid:12)(cid:12)Γ1

= (er · σer)(cid:12)(cid:12)Σ1

(62)
again having used S = det F σF−T and det F = 1. Substituting (61) and
(62) into (51) yields (55b).

= σr(r1, t) = 0,

Finally, by substituting the expressions (55a) and (55b) for the driving

forces into the kinetic equations (54) we arrive at the pair of equations

b0V0 = (µ0 − µR,0)R − W (r1/r0) ,
b1V1 = (µ1 − µR,1)R − W (r1/r0) ,

(63a)
(63b)

Remark: Recall that the strain energy function W (λ) deﬁned in (21) and
appearing above is increasing for λ ≥ 1; see (23). Recall also from the
discussion below (55a), (55b) that the W term in (63a) enters via the stress
and so we may conclude that stress always hinders accretion at the inner
surface. On the other hand we observed in that same discussion that the
W term in (63b) enters via the strain energy, not stress, and this shows
that strain energy promotes ablation at the outer surface. Since W ≥ 0 and
V0 > 0 we see from (63a) that necessarily

µ0 > µR,0.

(64)

There is no similar requirement at the outer surface.

In the summary at the end of Section 4 we observed that two more equa-
tions were needed in order to solve the problem stated there. These are
provided by (63a) and (63b) and so we are now in a position to carefully
state the problem of interest and to analyze it. We turn to this next.

6

The treadmilling regime: analysis and re-
sults.

6.1 The system governing treadmilling.

In the treadmilling regime all evolution processes are steady and so it follows
from (44) and (45) that the velocities V0 and V1 are necessarily constant.
Therefore from (54), the driving forces f0 and f1 must also be constant. Not
surprisingly, it now follows from (55a) (or (55b)) and (23) that the outer
radius r1 of the body, which in general is time dependent due to accretion,
remains constant in the treadmilling regime:

It is immediate from (40) that

˙r1 = 0.

V1 = −V0.

(65)

(66)

This too is not surprising since under stationary conditions the addition of
material at Γ0 will be balanced by its removal at Γ1. Observe now from (45)2
that, because of (66),

µ1 = µ∞.

(67)
Equation (44)2 tells us that in the treadmilling regime µ(r) = µ∞ for r ≥ r1,
and therefore that there is no free particle ﬂux outside of the solid body.
This reﬂects the fact that in the treadmilling regime the accretive process
is self-sustaining in the sense that the mass of free particles being attached
to the body at Σ0 is precisely equal to the mass of free particles detaching
from it at Σ1. Since the mobility M + outside the solid no longer aﬀects the
analysis, it is convenient to set

M = M−

(68)

from hereon.

We can now eliminate µ1 and V1 and reduce the problem to solving the

treadmilling system consisting of the three equations

µ∞ − µ0
r1 − r0

r1
r0

,

RV0 = M
b0V0 = (µ0 − µR,0)R − W (r1/r0) ,
b1V0 = −(µ∞ − µR,1)R + W (r1/r0) ,

(69a)

(69b)
(69c)

23

for the remaining unknowns (V0, µ0, r1) with

V0 > 0 and r1 > r0.

(70)

Recall that (69a) follows from Fick’s law combined with balance of mass
relating the free particle ﬂux reaching Σ0 per unit time with the rate of
accretion of M at Γ0. The remaining equations follow from the kinetic laws
at the accretion fronts Γ0, Γ1.

6.2 Results.

In this subsection we state the main analytical results of this study: (i) the
solvability of the system governing treadmilling; and (ii) calculate asymptotic
estimates for the thickness of the solid and the rate of accretion when the
bead radius is either much smaller than or much larger than a characteristic
length. Proofs of these results are given in the next subsection, while several
implications are discussed in Section 7.

It will be useful in what follows to let V∗, V∗∗ and (cid:96)∗ denote the following

characteristic velocity and length scales:

V∗ :=

µR,1 − µR,0

b0 + b1

R,

V∗∗ :=

µR,1 − µ∞

b1

R,

(cid:96)∗ :=

(b0 + b1)M

2
R

. (71)

The terms on the right hand sides of these equations are all known and so
we may consider V∗, V∗∗ and (cid:96)∗ to be given. We will see shortly that the
accretion velocity lies in the range V∗∗ < V0 < V∗ and asymptotic results will
derived when r0/(cid:96)∗ → 0 or ∞.
Proposition 1 (Solvability of the treadmilling system). The treadmilling
system (69) admits a solution (V0, µ0, r1) satisfying V0 > 0 and r1 > r0 if
and only

V∗ > 0

(72)

and

(73)
Moreover, when (72) and (73) hold, this solution is unique. Furthermore,
the accretion velocity V0 in the treadmilling regime satisﬁes

V∗ > V∗∗.

V∗∗ < V0 < V∗.

(74)

24

The functions V0 = V0(η), µ0 = µ0(η) and r1 = r1(η) that solve the
treadmilling system depend continuously on the nondimensional bead radius

η :=

r0
(cid:96)∗

.

(75)

Moreover it can be shown that these functions have ﬁnite limiting values
when η → 0 and ∞. The next three propositions are concerned with the
asymptotic behavior of the functions V0(η) and d(η) = r1(η) − r0 in those
limits, the latter being the thickness

d := r1 − r0

(76)

of the solid. The conditions for treadmilling established in Proposition 1
are assumed to hold and so the existence of a unique solution is taken for
granted.

where we have used (71) and let

ν = r1/r0.

Equation (86a) is obtained by eliminating µ0 and V0 from (69); (86b) is
equivalent to (69c); and (86c) is obtained by adding (69b) and (69c).

The only unknown in equation (86a) is ν. If it can be solved for ν(η) then

(86b) gives V0(η) and (86c) gives µ0(η).

for λ ≥ 1. By making use of (86b) and (86a) we see that the solvability of
the treadmilling problem is equivalent to there being roots V0 > 0, ν > 1 of
the system

V0 = gη(ν),

V0 = h(ν).

(88)

We are now in a position to establish Proposition 1. First, observe from
(87)1 that gη(λ) has the same sign as V∗ for all λ ≥ 1. Since it is required
that V0 > 0, it now follows because of (87)1 and (88)1 that it is necessary
that V∗ > 0.
function gη(λ) is monotonically decreasing for λ ≥ 1 and satisﬁes:

Second, granted V∗ > 0, it can be readily conﬁrmed that the continuous

gη(λ) ≤ gη(1) = V∗ for all λ ≥ 1

and

λ→+∞ gη(λ) = V∗/(1 + η).
lim

Likewise, it is readily seen from the deﬁnition of W (λ) given in (21), together
with (23), that the continuous function h(λ) is monotonically increasing for
λ > 1 and satisﬁes:

h(λ) ≥ h(1) = V∗∗ for all λ ≥ 1

and

λ→+∞ h(λ) = +∞.

lim

It now follows that the equation gη(ν) = h(ν) has no root ν > 1 unless
V∗∗ < V∗ which is a second necessary condition for there to be a solution.

Conversely when V∗ > 0 and V∗∗ < V∗, the foregoing considerations show
that the system (88) has a unique solution V0 > 0 and that it lies in the
range V∗∗ < V0 < V∗. Proposition 1 is thus established. Figure 3 shows
schematically the graphical construction to ﬁnd the solution of the tread-
milling system. The graphs of gη(λ) and h(λ) intersect at only one point,
whose coordinates deliver the solution to system (88).

We now turn to the propositions concerning the behavior of the solution
V0(η), r1(η), µ0(η) in the limits η → 0 and η → ∞. We can anticipate the
results by the following graphical discussion. Observe from (87) that the
function h(λ) does not depend on η but gη(λ) does. First, when η → 0, we
see that gη → V∗ at each ﬁxed λ. Since the point at which the two curves
intersect has coordinates (r1(η)/r0, V0(η)), the schematic Figure 5 informs
us that V0(η) → V∗ in this limit. In the other limit when η → ∞ we see
from (87) that gη(λ) → 0 for λ > 1 with gη(1) = V∗. Thus for a large value
of η, the function gη decreases rapidly from the value V∗ towards the value
V∗/(1 + η) as λ increases, and so the graph of gη has a boundary layer near
λ = 1 as indicated in the schematic plots depicted in Figure 6. Again, since

27

Figure 4: Schematic plots of the functions gη(λ) and h(λ) deﬁned in (87): gη decreases
monotonically from the value gη(1) = V∗ while h increases monotonically from the value
h(1) = V∗∗. As λ → ∞, h becomes unbounded while g converges to V∗/(1 + η) > 0. The
coordinates of the unique point of intersection are (r1/r0, V0). The ﬁgure has been drawn
for the case V∗∗ > 0 though it is possible for V∗∗ to be negative.

the point at which the two curves intersect has coordinates (r0(η/r1, V0(η)),
the ﬁgures indicate that V0(η) → 0 if V∗∗ < 0 and r0(η)/r1 → 1 if V∗∗ > 0.
We now turn to the analysis of these limiting cases. The necessary and
suﬃcient conditions, V∗ > 0, V∗ > V∗∗, for the existence of a unique solution
to the treadmilling problem are assumed to hold. To this eﬀect, we observe
that an application of Dini’s implicit function theorem to equation (86a),
which deﬁnes ν(η) implicitly, ensures that ν(η) is continuous and strictly
decreasing for η ≥ 0.
Proposition 2: (Small bead.) Since ν(η) is continuous, we have:

ν(η) → ν∗ ≥ 1

as

η → 0.

(89)

The limit ν∗ can be identiﬁed by taking the limits of both sides of the equation
(86a), which yields

V∗ = V∗∗ +

W (ν∗),

(90)

an equation that, by a special case of Propoisition 1, is guaranteed to have
a unique solution ν∗ > 1. Equation (86b) together with (90) now gives

and equation (86c) gives

This establishes Proposition 2.

V0(η) → V∗,

µ0(η) → µ∞.

Figure 5: Schematic plots of the functions gη(λ) and h(λ) for a small value of η. As
η → 0 we have gη → V∗ at each λ. Since the coordinates of the unique point of intersection
are (r1(η)/r0, V0(η)), we expect that V0(η) → V∗ in the limit η → 0.

We now turn to the limit η → ∞. Suppose that

ν(η) → ν∗∗ ≥ 1

η → ∞.

as

We see from the denominator of the left hand side of (86a) that we have to
distinguish between the cases ν∗∗ = 1 and ν∗∗ > 1.
Proposition 3: (Large bead. Case V∗∗ ≥ 0.) Since ν(η) is decreasing, and
since ν(η) ≥ 1, we have that ν(η) converges to some ν∗∗ ≥ 1 as η → ∞. The
possibility that ν∗∗ is strictly greater than 1 can be ruled out since, otherwise,
on passing to the limit in (86a) we would obtain 0 = V∗∗ + W (ν∗∗)/b1, which
cannot hold since V∗∗ ≥ 0 and W (λ) > 0 for λ > 0. Thus, we conclude that:
(93)

ν(η) → ν∗∗ = 1

η → ∞.

as

Then equation (86b) together with W (ν(η)) → W (1) = 0 gives

V0(η) → V∗∗.

(94)
Since we need V0 > 0 it follows that this case occurs only if V∗∗ ≥ 0 which is
precisely the condition under which Proposition 3 has been claimed to hold.
Using the limiting value of V0 from (94) in equation (86c) gives

µ0(η) → µ∞ +

As η → ∞ the function gη → 0 at each λ > 0 while gη(1) = V∗. The coordinates of the
unique point of intersection are (r1(η)/r0, V0). Therefore in the case V∗∗ ≥ 0 (left) we
expect that r1(η)/r0 → 0 as η → ∞. In the case V∗∗ < 0 (right), we expect V0(η) → 0 as

This establishes Proposition 3.
Proposition 4: (Large bead. Case V∗∗ < 0.) We now argue that

As in Proposition 3, ν(η) converges monotonically to a limit ν∗∗ ≥ 1. However
since gη is a positive function, we must also have h(ν∗∗) > 0, and this is only
possible if ν∗∗ > 1, since we are in the case V∗∗ < 0 (see Figure 6).

Again, as noted in the preceding subsection, in view of the properties of W ,

condition under which Proposition 4 was stated to hold. Equation (86b) now
tells us that

V0(η) → 0

7 Discussion and summary

(100)

(101)

We now examine various implications of the results of the previous section,
and make some remarks on their place within a larger perspective.

According to Proposition 1, necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the
existence of a unique solution to the treadmilling porblem are that V∗ > 0
and V∗ > V∗∗. These conditions can be written more illuminatingly in terms
of the chemical potentials by using (71) in the respective forms

and

µR,1 > µR,0,

µ∞ > µ∗ :=

b0µR,1 + b1µR,0

b0 + b1

.

(102)

(103)

The former inequality states that the referential chemical potential at the
outer surface must exceed that at the inner surface, while the latter requires
the remote chemical potential µ∞ to exceed a certain “mean chemical poten-
tial” µ∗.

Accretion at the inner surface is limited by both diﬀusion and stress build-
up. The former is characterized by the terms in (69) that involve diﬀerences
in chemical potential; the latter by the terms involving W . It is seen from
(69a) that µ∞ − µ0 increases as d increases (at constant r0, M and V0). This
implies, as one would expect, that the larger the thickness d, the larger is
the chemical potential drop µ∞ − µ0 necessary to support a given accretion
rate V0. We also see from (69b) that the smaller the value of the chemical
potential µ0 at the inner surface, the slower the accretion rate V0 will be (at
the same values of the other terms in (69b)).

The eﬀects of mechanics on the accretion rate are lumped into the last
term of the right-hand side of (69b). When the thickness d increases, so does

31

the ratio r1/r0, and therefore, since W (λ) is an increasing function for λ > 1,
it follows from (69b) that the accretion velocity V0 decreases. As for the
ablation rate at the outer surface, as noted previously, the discussion below
(55a), (55b), shows that the W term in (63b) enters via the strain energy,
not stress, and this shows that strain energy promotes ablation at the outer
surface.

The limiting cases of small and large beads: The respective limiting
values of the ratio r1/r0 when η → 0 and η → ∞ (with V∗∗ < 0), i.e. ν∗ and
ν∗∗, are given by the roots of (78) and (83). In view of (73), the right-hand
side of (78) is positive. Thus, given the properties (23), (24) of W (λ), there
is precisely one root ν∗ > 1 of (78). Similar considerations apply to (83).

Case of a small bead: According to Proposition 2, we may take

(cid:39) ν∗ − 1,

d
r0

(104)

as an approximate formula for the thickness of the solid when r0 << (cid:96)∗.
Here ν∗ > 1 is the unique root (78). Although (78) cannot, in general, be
solved explicitly for ν∗, we can do so if we replace the function W (λ) by its
second-order Taylor expansion at λ = 1. On using the result in (104) we
obtain the following estimate for the thickness in this regime:

(cid:115)

(cid:39)

d

2(µ∞ − µ∗)R

W (cid:48)(cid:48)(1)

,

(105)

which is expected to be accurate when µ∞ − µ∗ is small.

(cid:112)∆(cid:101)µ/Caξ2, where ∆(cid:101)µ is the chemical energy released in the

Equation (105) shows in particular that the thickness d is proportional
to the radius r0. This agrees with the results of [26], whose formula (26)
gives d (cid:39) r0
polymerization process, C is the elasticity modulus of the actin gel, a is the
distance between two actin units in an F-actin chain, and ξ is the average
distance between nucleating proteins on the surface of the bead; this estimate
was obtained by imposing a balance between chemical energy gained and
the elastic energy expended during polymerization. A comparison with our
R ∝ 1/(aξ2) and C (cid:39) W (cid:48)(cid:48)(1).
As can be seen from (69a), (76) and (77), µ0(η) → µ∞ when η → 0.
Because of this, and since (cid:96)∗ ∝ M by (71), the limit η → 0 is associated with
the diﬀusion constant M → ∞ and the chemical potential drop µ∞−µ0 → 0.
In this regime it is the stress build-up that inhibits accretion at the inner

results is straightforward if we identify µ∞ − µ∗ with ∆(cid:101)µ and observe that

surface. We therefore refer to this as the stress-limited regime. Since ν(η) →
ν∗ > 1 when η → 0, the thickness d(η) = (ν(η) − 1)r0, is proportional to r0
in this case, consistent with the analysis in [26].

Case of a large bead: In the case of a large bead, the behavior of the
system depends on whether V∗∗ ≥ 0 (Proposition 3) or V∗∗ < 0 (Proposition
4). In terms of the chemical potentials, these cases corresponds to whether
the referential chemical potential µR,1 at the outer surface of the solid is not
less than or less than the chemical potential µ1(= µ∞) of the ﬂowing free
particles at that location:

µR,1 ≥ µ∞ ⇔ V∗∗ ≥ 0;

µR,1 < µ∞ ⇔ V∗∗ < 0,

see (71).

Subcase η → ∞, µR,1 ≥ µ∞: It follows from(69a), (77) and (78) that
the limiting values of ν(η), V0(η) and µ(η) are all independent of W . In this
regime the stress build-up plays no signiﬁcant role, and what limits accre-
tion is the available supply of free particles ﬂowing from the outer surface.
Following [26], we refer to this as the diﬀusion-limited regime. The estimate
(80) for the thickness in this regime can be written in terms of the chemical
potentials as:

(cid:39) (cid:96)∗

d
r0

µ∞ − µ∗
µR,1 − µ∞

1
η

(106)
Subcase η → ∞, µR,1 < µ∞: This case, which is covered in Proposition

.

4, takes place when η → ∞ with µR,1 < µ∞.

According to Proposition 4, if the radius of the bead tends to inﬁnity, the
thickness of the solid tends to inﬁnity as well, since the ratio ν = r1/r0 tends
to ν∗∗ > 1. To explain this result, we propose the following argument.

When the radius of the bead tends to inﬁnity, mechanical eﬀects become
negligibly small:
indeed, when the layers that comprise the body grow on
a ﬂat surface, they can be pushed away without suﬀering circumferential
stretch. Thus, we may think of an inﬁnitely large bead as the same as a ﬁnite
bead with vanishingly small energy W (λ). Now, we know that treadmilling
can be attained only when V1 is negative. However, the kinetic equation (63b)
tells us that if W (λ) is small and µR,1 < µ∞, then V1 is positive unless the
ratio r1/r0 is very large, that is to say, the body has a very large thickness.
Finally we return to the case of an arbitrary value of η. Figure 7 shows
how the thickness of the solid d varies with the bead radius r0 in the case of
a neo-Hookean material. The solid curve was determined by (numerically)
solving the treadmilling system (69) with the neo-Hookean energy (34). The

33

dashed curve is based on the approximate formula (106) in the diﬀusion-
limited regime. There is good agreement for large values of η. The dotted
straight line is based on the approximate estimation (104) in the stress-
limited regime. The two solutions agree at η = 0.

solving the treadmilling system (69) with the neo-Hookean strain energy (34).

7.1 Summary.

Inspired by experiments on actin motility, we have considered a model prob-
lem which features (surface) accretion of an annular spherical on a rigid
sphere. The process considered has the unusual characteristic that new ma-
terial is added to the solid, not at its outer surface, but rather at its inner
surface where it is in contact with the spherical support. The process of
accretion is sustained by a diﬀusive ﬂow of particles both inside and outside
of the solid, with particles attaching to the solid when they reach the inner
surface. Simultaneously, particles detach from the solid at the outer surface
and are returned to the particle ﬂow. In the treadmilling regime these two
processes are balanced and the region occupied by the solid is time indepen-
dent even though particles continue to attach and detach from the solid at,
respectively, its the inner and outer surface.

In order to distinguish accretion from motion, we found it convenient
to choose an evolving reference conﬁguration that allowed us to label the

34

2.521.510.512340.51.52.53.5030individual material points that comprise the solid, and to keep track of the
addition and removal of material points. This was achieved by the selection
of a four-dimensional reference space.

The accretion rate is determined by three factors: the diﬀerence in the
chemical potential of a particle when it is free and when it is attached to the
solid; the strain energy of the solid; and the radial normal stress. The driving
force for accretion that we derive in a thermodynamically consistent manner
involves all three of these factors. On the assumption of small deviations
from thermodynamical equilibrium we take a linear kinetic relation between
the driving force and the accretion rate.

We have established necessary and suﬃcient conditions under which a
treadmilling state exists, and we have shown that, when those conditions
hold, the solution is unique. Moreover according to our model the build-up of
stress at the inner boundary hinders accretion, whereas at the outer surface,
it is the build-up of strain energy, not stress, that causes the ablation rate
at the outer surface to increase. These results apply to arbitrary uniform,
isotropic, incompressible, elastic materials.

By an asymptotic analysis we have shown that for small beads the thick-
ness of the solid is proportional to the radius of the support and is strongly
aﬀected by the stiﬀness of the solid, whereas for large beads the stiﬀness
of the solid is essentially irrelevant, and the thickness is proportional to a
characteristic length that depends on the parameters that govern diﬀusion
and accretion kinetics.
