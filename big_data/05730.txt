Variational inequalities

for the spectral fractional Laplacian

Roberta Musina∗ and Alexander I. Nazarov†

Abstract

In this paper we study the obstacle problems for the Navier (spectral) fractional

Laplacian (−∆Ω)s of order s ∈ (0, 1), in a bounded domain Ω ⊂ Rn.

1

Introduction

Let Ω be a bounded and Lipschitz domain in Rn, n ≥ 1. Given s ∈ (0, 1), a measurable

function ψ on Ω and f ∈ eH s(Ω)′, we consider the variational inequality

u ∈ K s

ψ ,

h(−∆Ω)s u − f, v − ui ≥ 0 ∀v ∈ K s
ψ .

(PΩ(ψ, f ))

eq:vi

Here (−∆Ω)s is the spectral (or Navier) fractional Laplacian, that is the s-th power of
the standard Laplacian in the sense of spectral theory, and

K s

ψ =nv ∈ eH s(Ω) | v ≥ ψ a.e. on Ω o .

We will always assume that the closed and convex set K s
explicitly stated.

ψ is not empty, also when not

as well. In fact, it is easy to show that any solution u ∈ eH s(Ω) to (2) satisﬁes PΩ(ψ, f ),

see Remark 4.4. The converse needs more care. One of the main motivations of the
present paper was indeed to ﬁnd out mild regularity assumptions on the data, to have
that the solution u to PΩ(ψ, f ) solves the free boundary problem (2).

Problem (2) has been largely investigated in case (−∆Ω)s is replaced by the ”Dirich-

let” Laplacian (−∆)s, that is deﬁned via the Fourier transform by

see Section 6 for details. On this subject, we cite the pioneering paper [24] by Louis E.
Silvestre, [2, 4, 6, 10, 20, 21, 23] and references there-in, with no attempt to provide a
complete list.

As far as we know, the variational inequality PΩ(ψ, f ) and the free boundary prob-
lem (2) has never been discussed before. Actually, the ”Navier” case is more challenging,
because of the dependence of the diﬀerential operator (−∆)s on the domain. This extra
diﬃculty led us to investigate in Section 2 the dependence Ω 7→ (−∆Ω)s. The results
there, and in particular Lemmata 2.2, 2.3 might have an independent interest and could
open new research directions, see Remark 2.4.

In Section 3 we focus our attention on the action of (−∆Ω)s on truncations v 7→ v±.
The results here are essentially used in the remaining part of the paper, as they provide
the needed tools to construct test functions for PΩ(ψ, f ). Once we have developed
the above mentioned tools, we indicate how to modify the arguments in [20] to ﬁnd
out useful equivalent formulations and continuous dependence results for PΩ(ψ, f ), see
Section 4.

Section 5 is entirely dedicated to regularity results. Most of the proofs here follows
the outlines of the proofs in [20]. However here again more attention is needed because

2

of the dependence Ω 7→ (−∆Ω)s; the preliminary results in Section 2 will be crucially
used in the proof of our main regularity result, that is stated in Theorem 5.1.

In the last section we take f = 0 and compare the solution to PΩ(ψ, f ) with the
solution of the corresponding variational inequality with Dirichlet fractional operator
(−∆)s. The main result is stated in Theorem 6.3.

Notation. For a bounded and Lipschitz domain Ω ⊂ Rn we denote by −∆Ω the conventional Dirichlet
Laplacian in Ω, that is the self-adjoint operator in L2(Ω) deﬁned by its quadratic form

h−∆Ωu, ui = k∇uk2
2,

u ∈ H 1

0 (Ω).

We denote by λj, j ≥ 1, the eigenvalues of −∆Ω arranged in a non-decreasing unbounded sequence,

according to their multiplicities. Corresponding eigenfunctions

ϕj ∈ H 1

0 (Ω) ,

−∆ϕj = λjϕj ,

j ≥ 1,

form an orthogonal bases in L2(Ω) and in H 1

0 (Ω), and we assume them orthonormal in L2(Ω).

For u ∈ H 1

0 (Ω) we have

u =

∞Xj=1(cid:16)Z

uϕj(cid:17)ϕj , −∆Ωu =

Next, take s ∈ (0, 1). The “Navier” (or spectral) fractional Laplacian of order s on Ω is deﬁned

by the series (in the sense of distributions)

(−∆Ω)su =

It is known that the domain of the corresponding quadratic form h(−∆Ω)s u, ui is the space

see for instance [18, Lemma 1]. The standard reference for the Sobolev space H s(Rn) is the monograph

eH s(Ω) := {u ∈ H s(Rn) | u ≡ 0 on Rn \ Ω},

It is convenient to regard at eH s(Ω), s ∈ (0, 1], as a subspace of eH s(BR), where BR is an
open ball containing Ωh, so that we have continuous embeddings eH s(Ω) ֒→ eH s(Ωh) ֒→
eH s(BR). In particular, H 1

It is easy to show that the domains Ωh γ-converge to Ω as h → ∞. That is, for

Let us recall some facts from [9, Lemma XI.9.5], see also [12, Theorem 2.3.2] and [3,
Example 2.1]. The γ-convergence of the domains implies that the eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of −∆Ωh converge, respectively, to the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of
−∆Ω. More precisely, it turns out that

provided that eigenfunctions corresponding to multiple eigenvalues are suitably chosen.
Now we start to study the behavior of the fractional Laplacian (−∆Ωh)s as h → ∞.
The next lemma, of independent interest, will be crucially used in the proof of our
regularity results.

L:eige_ueps Lemma 2.2 Let uh ∈ eH s(Ωh) be a bounded sequence in eH s(Ωh) such that uh → u in

L2(BR). Then u ∈ eH s(Ω) and

h(−∆Ω)s u, ui ≤ lim inf

Proof. Clearly, u is the weak limit of the sequence uh in eH s(BR) and uh → u almost
everywhere. Hence u ∈ eH s(Ω). Next, for any integer m ≥ 1 we have that

3 Truncations

Truncation operators play an important role in studying obstacle problems. For mea-
surable functions v, w we put

v ∨ w = max{v, w} ,

v ∧ w = min{v, w} ,

v+ = v ∨ 0 ,

v− = −(v ∧ 0),

so that v = v+ − v− and |v| = v+ + v−. It is well known that v ∨ w ∈ H s(Rn) and
v ∧ w ∈ H s(Rn) if v, w ∈ H s(Rn). In addition it holds that

and i) with a large inequality follows.

Now assume that equality holds in i). We have to show that v + m is nonnegative or
nonpositive. Since equality holds everywhere in (12), then E((wΩ

We infer that (wΩ

(v+m)− ) admits
a unique solution. Whence, (wΩ

Thus iii) holds true, and the lemma is completely proved.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.2 For the Dirichlet fractional Laplacian the inequalities i)–iii) were proved
in [20, Lemma 2.4] with large signs. Arguing as above and using the Caﬀarelli-Silvestre
extension [5] instead of [25] we can get complete “Dirichlet” analog of Lemma 4.1.

R:MP Remark 3.3 Taking m = 0 in Lemma 3.1 we obtain the ”Navier” counterpart of [20,

Lemma 2.1]. The statement iii) in this case can be rewritten as follows: for v ∈ eH s(Ω)

with v+, v− 6= 0

h(−∆Ω)s v+, v−i = h(−∆Ω)s v−, v+i < 0.

Next, we notice that ii) in Lemma 3.1 with m = 0 gives the well known weak maximum
principle for (−∆Ω)s. A strong maximum principle was proved in [7, Lemma 2.4].

Namely, if u ∈ eH s(Ω) \ {0} and (−∆Ω)s u ≥ 0 in Ω then u is bounded away from zero

on every compact set K ⊂ Ω.

We start by recalling the notion of (distributional) supersolution.

Deﬁnition 4.1 A function U ∈ eH s(Ω) is a supersolution for (−∆Ω)s v = f if

h(−∆Ω)s U − f, ϕi ≥ 0

for any ϕ ∈ eH s(Ω), ϕ ≥ 0.

Thanks to the results in the previous section, the arguments in [20, Section 3] can be
easily adapted to cover the problem PΩ(ψ, f ). We start by pointing out some equivalent
formulations for PΩ(ψ, f ). For the proof, argue as for [20, Theorem 3.2].

T:sup Theorem 4.2 Let u ∈ K s

ψ. The following sentences are equivalent.

a) u is the solution to the problem PΩ(ψ, f );

b) u is the smallest supersolution for (−∆Ω)s v = f in the convex set K s

ψ. That is,

U ≥ u almost everywhere in Ω, for any supersolution U ∈ K s
ψ;

c) u is a supersolution for (−∆Ω)s v = f and

h(−∆Ω)s u − f, (v − u)−i = 0

for any v ∈ K s
ψ.

d) h(−∆Ω)s v − f, v − ui ≥ 0 for any v ∈ K s
ψ.

The next corollary is an immediate consequence of a) ⇒ b) in Theorem 4.2.

compare_f Corollary 4.3 Let f1, f2 ∈ eH s(Ω)′ and let ui be the solution to PΩ(ψ, fi), i = 1, 2. If

f1 ≥ f2 in the sense of distributions, then u1 ≥ u2 a.e. in Ω.

R:uniqueness Remark 4.4 Let u ∈ K s

ψ be such that (−∆Ω)s u ≥ f in Ω. Then (−∆Ω)s u − f can
be identiﬁed with a nonnegative Radon measure on Ω. Assume that the support of
this measure is contained in the coincidence set {u = ψ}, so that u solves the free
boundary problem (2). Let v ∈ K s
ψ. Since (v − u)− vanishes on {u = ψ}, we have
h(−∆Ω)s u − f, (v − u)−i = 0. Hence u solves PΩ(ψ, f ) by Theorem 4.2.

Now we can state our continuous dependence results. The proof of the next theorem

is totally similar to the proof of Theorem 4.1 in [20], and we omit it.

T:bounded1 Theorem 4.5 Let ψ1, ψ2 be given obstacles, f ∈ eH s(Ω)′ and let ui be solutions to

PΩ(ψi, f ), i = 1, 2. If ψ1 − ψ2 ∈ L∞(Ω), then the diﬀerence u1 − u2 is bounded, and

i) k(u1 − u2)+k∞ ≤ k(ψ1 − ψ2)+k∞ ,

ii) k(u1 − u2)−k∞ ≤ k(ψ1 − ψ2)−k∞.

In particular, ku1 − u1k∞ ≤ kψ1 − ψ2k∞.

tion of (14), the ﬁrst inequality in (13) follows by the maximum principle in Remark 3.3.
To prove the second inequality in (13) we introduce the functions ωN

Proof. Notice that f ∈ eH s(Ω)′ by Sobolev embedding theorem. Since u is supersolu-
f + ∈ eH s(Ω) via

It has been proved in [20], proof of Corollary 4.2, that ωD

f + ≤ ckf +kp, where the constant

f + ≤ ckf +kp a.e. in Ω.

Now let u1 be the unique solution of PΩ(ψ, f +). We can consider ωN

5 Regularity results

S:regularity1

Let u be the solution to PΩ(ψ, f ). In this Section we provide estimates of the Radon
measure (−∆Ω)s u − f ≥ 0 in Ω and a regularity result for u. The results in Section 2
will be largely used.

Recall that ωf is the solution to the boundary value problem (14).

T:measure Theorem 5.1 Assume that f ∈ eH s(Ω)′ and that f, ψ satisfy the following conditions.

A1) (ψ − ωf )+ ∈ eH s(Ω);

A2) (−∆Ω)s (ψ − ωf )+ − f is a locally ﬁnite signed measure on Ω.

Let u ∈ eH s(Ω) be the solution to PΩ(ψ, f ). Then

0 ≤ (−∆Ω)s u − f ≤ ((−∆Ω)s (ψ − ωf )+ − f )+ in the distributional sense on Ω.

Proof. The ﬁrst step is quite similar to the Dirichlet case ([20, Theorem 1.1]) and is
based on the penalty method by Lewy-Stampacchia [15].

Notice that we can assume f = 0, ψ ∈ eH s(Ω) and ψ ≥ 0 in Ω.
u − ωf ∈ eH s(Ω) and (−∆Ω)s (u − ωf ) ≥ 0, then u − ωf ≥ 0 in Ω by the maximum

principle in Remark 3.3. Thus u − ωf ≥ ψ ∨ ωf − ωf = (ψ − ωf )+ and u − ωf solves
the obstacle problem PΩ((ψ − ωf )+, 0).

In fact, since

In conclusion, we only have to show that

0 ≤ (−∆Ω)s u ≤ ((−∆Ω)s ψ)+ in the distributional sense on Ω,

(15)

eq:ineq

where u solves PΩ(ψ, 0) and ψ is a nonnegative obstacle in eH s(Ω), such that (−∆Ω)s ψ

is a measure on Ω. The ﬁrst inequality in (15) holds by Theorem 4.2.

Now we prove the following claim:

Assume (−∆Ω)s ψ ∈ Lp(Ω) for any p > 1. Then (15) holds.

(16)

eq:step1

We take p ≥ 2n

θε ∈ C ∞(R) such that 0 ≤ θε ≤ 1, and θε(t) = 1 for t ≤ 0, θε(t) = 0 for t ≥ ε. Let

n+2s , that is needed only if n > 2s. Then eH s(Ω) ֒→ Lp′(Ω) and Lp(Ω) ⊂
eH s(Ω)′ by Sobolev embeddings. In particular ((−∆Ω)s ψ)+ ∈ eH s(Ω)′. Take a function
uε ∈ eH s(Ω) be the unique solution to

(−∆Ω)s uε = θε(uε − ψ) ((−∆Ω)s ψ)+ in Ω.

(17)

eq:penalty

11

Notice that (1 − θε(uε − ψ))(ψ − uε)+ = 0 a.e.
in Ω. Therefore, using ii) in Lemma
3.1 with v = ψ − uε and m = 0 one gets (ψ − uε)+ ≡ 0. In particular we infer that
uε ∈ K s

ψ. On the other hand, (−∆Ω)s uε ≥ 0; thus uε ≥ u by b) in Theorem 4.2.

Next, notice that (−∆Ω)s (uε − u) ≤ (−∆Ω)s uε and that θε(uε − ψ)(uε − u − ε)+ = 0
a.e. in Ω. Then again ii) in Lemma 3.1 plainly implies (uε − u − ε)+ ≡ 0. In conclusion,
we have u ≤ uε ≤ u+ε, hence kuε−uk∞ → 0 as h → ∞. Therefore, for any nonnegative
test function ϕ ∈ C ∞

0 (Ω) we have that

h(−∆Ω)s u, ϕi = Z

u (−∆Ω)s ϕ dx =Z

uε (−∆Ω)s ϕ dx + oε(1)

Ω

Ω

= h(−∆Ω)s uε, ϕi + oε(1) ≤ h((−∆Ω)s ψ)+, ϕi + oε(1).

Thus, (−∆Ω)s u ≤ ((−∆Ω)s ψ)+ in the distributional sense in Ω, and (16) is proved.

The second step uses an approximation argument that requires to enlarge the domain
Ω. It needs more care than in the Dirichlet case, because of the dependence of the Navier
quadratic form on the domain. Let Ωh ⊃ Ω, h ≥ 1, be a sequence of uniformly Lipschitz
domains satisfying (8). The convex set

contains K s

Kh(ψ) = {v ∈ eH s(Ωh) | v ≥ ψ a.e. on Rn }

ψ, hence it is not empty. Let uh ∈ eH s(Ωh) be the solution to

h(−∆Ωh)suh, v − uhi ≥ 0

uh ∈ Kh(ψ) ,

∀v ∈ Kh(ψ) .

(PΩh)

eq:eps

We claim that

(−∆Ωh)suh ≤ ((−∆Ω)s ψ)+ in the distributional sense on Ω.

(18)

eq:claim1

Fix h, and approximate ψ with a sequence of smooth obstacles ψk = ψ ∗ ρk, where
0 (Ωh). In addition ψk → ψ in
supp(ρk) ⊂ B 1

. For k large enough we have ψk ∈ C ∞

eH s(BR) as k → ∞, where BR is any ball containing Ωh. Now, let uk

h ∈ eH s(Ωh) be the

eq:vih

Then uk

h → uh in eH s(Ωh) as k → ∞ by Theorem 4.8, and (16) gives

h ≤ ((−∆Ωh)sψk)+ in the distributional sense on Ω.

(−∆Ωh)suk

(19)

eq:eps_h

Next, ((−∆Ωh)sψ)+ ∗ ρk is a nonnegative smooth function, and

((−∆Ωh)sψ)+ ∗ ρk ≥ ((−∆Ωh)sψ) ∗ ρk = (−∆Ωh)sψk.

12

Thus ((−∆Ωh)sψ)+ ∗ ρh ≥ ((−∆Ωh)sψk)+, and (19) implies

(−∆Ωh)suk

h ≤ ((−∆Ωh)sψ)+ ∗ ρk

in the distributional sense on Ω.

Now, as k → ∞ we have that ((−∆Ωh)sψ)+∗ρk → ((−∆Ωh)sψ)+ in the sense of measures,
and (−∆Ωh)suk

h → (−∆Ωh)suh in the sense of distributions. Thus

(−∆Ωh)suh ≤ ((−∆Ωh)sψ)+ in the distributional sense on Ω.

Since ψ ∈ eH s(Ω) is nonnegative, Lemma 2.1 gives ((−∆Ωh)sψ)+ ≤ ((−∆Ω)s ψ)+, and

(18) follows.

The last step is the passage to the limit in (18) as the domains Ωh shrink to Ω. It

makes the main diﬀerence with respect to the Dirichlet case. We notice that u ∈ eH s(Ωh)

and in particular u ∈ Kh(ψ). Therefore, using the variational characterization of uh as
the solution to (PΩh) and Lemma 2.1 we ﬁnd

h(−∆Ωh)suh, uhi ≤ h(−∆Ωh)su, ui ≤ h(−∆Ω)s u, ui .

(20)

eq:uff

Lemma 2.1 gives also h(−∆BR)suh, uhi ≤ h(−∆Ωh)suh, uhi. Thus (20) implies that the

sequence uh is bounded in eH s(BR), and therefore we can assume that uh → ˜u weakly
in eH s(BR). Using Lemma 2.2 and (20) we readily get ˜u ∈ eH s(Ω) and

h(−∆Ω)s ˜u, ˜ui ≤ lim inf
h→∞

h(−∆Ωh)suh, uhi ≤ lim sup
h→∞

h(−∆Ωh)suh, uhi ≤ h(−∆Ω)s u, ui,(21)

that is, h(−∆Ω)s ˜u, ˜ui ≤ h(−∆Ω)s u, ui. On the other hand, uh → ˜u almost everywhere
and uh ≥ ψ on Ω. Thus ˜u ∈ K s
ψ. Using the characterization of u as the unique solution
to the minimization problem (1) (with f ≡ 0), we ﬁrst get ˜u = u. Then we use (21) to

To conclude take any nonnegative function η ∈ C ∞

0 (Ω). Using Ω ⊂ Ωh ⊂ Ωh ⊂ BR
and Lemma 2.1, we see that (−∆BR )sη ≤ (−∆Ωh)sη ≤ (−∆Ω)s η in BR . Thus (−∆Ωh)sη

infer that uh → u in eH s(BR).
is a bounded sequence in L2(BR) ֒→ eH s(BR)′. In addition, recall that uh → u in eH s(BR)
and (−∆Ωh)sη → (−∆Ω)s η weakly in eH s(Ω)′, see Lemma 2.3. Thus, we can use (18) to

estimate

h((−∆Ω)s ψ)+, ηi ≥ h(−∆Ωh)suh, ηi = h(−∆Ωh)sη, uhi = h(−∆Ωh)sη, ui + oh(1)

= h(−∆Ω)s η, ui + oh(1) = h(−∆Ω)s u, ηi + oh(1) .

The proof is complete.

In the next results we adopt ”pointwise” deﬁnitions of the contact set and of the

non-contact set (compare with Deﬁnition 6.1 below for a diﬀerent notion), that is,

{u = ψ} := {x ∈ Ω | u(x) = ψ(x)} ,

{u > ψ} := {x ∈ Ω | u(x) > ψ(x)} .

(22)

eq:set

Clearly, {u = ψ} and {u > ψ} are determined up to negligible sets.

T:regularity Theorem 5.2 Let ψ and f satisfy assumptions of Theorem 5.1 and

A3) ((−∆Ω)s (ψ − ωf )+ − f )+ ∈ Lp

loc(Ω) for some p ∈ [1, ∞].

Let u ∈ eH s(Ω) be the solution to PΩ(ψ, f ). Then the following facts hold.

i) (−∆Ω)s u − f ∈ Lp

loc(Ω);

ii) 0 ≤ (−∆Ω)s u − f ≤ ((−∆Ω)s (ψ − ωf )+ − f )+ a.e. on Ω;

iii) (−∆Ω)s u = f a.e. on {u > ψ}.

In particular, u solves the free boundary problem (2).

Proof. We follow the proof of [20, Theorem 1.1]. Statements i) and ii) hold by Theorem
5.1. Let us prove the last claim. As before, we assume f ≡ 0. Then (−∆Ω)s u ≥ 0. If
u ≡ 0 then iii) is evident. Otherwise the strong maximum principle, see Remark 3.3,
gives u > 0 in Ω. In particular, u ≥ ψ+ and {u > ψ} = {u > ψ+}.

Use c) in Theorem 4.2 with v = ψ+ ∈ eH s(Ω), to get h(−∆Ω)s u, u − ψ+i = 0. Let

0 (Ω) be any nonnegative cut oﬀ function; for m ≥ 1 put gm = (u − ψ+) ∧ m.

ϕ ∈ C ∞
Since (−∆Ω)s u ≥ 0 and u − ψ+ ≥ ϕgm, we have

0 = h(−∆Ω)s u, u − ψ+i ≥ h(−∆Ω)s u, ϕgmi =Z

Ω

(−∆Ω)s u · (ϕgm)dx.

The last equality holds because (−∆Ω)s u ∈ L1
support in Ω. Thanks to the monotone convergence theorem we get

loc(Ω) and ϕgm ∈ L∞(Ω) has compact

m→∞Z

0 ≥ lim

(−∆Ω)s u · ϕgm dx =Z

Ω

((−∆Ω)s u · (u − ψ+))ϕ dx.

Now ((−∆Ω)s u · (u − ψ+))ϕ ≥ 0 a.e. in Ω, that gives ((−∆Ω)s u · (u − ψ+))ϕ = 0 a.e.
in Ω. Since ϕ was arbitrarily chosen, we conclude that (−∆Ω)s u · (u − ψ+) = 0 a.e. in
Ω, and iii) is proved.
(cid:3)

R:regularity Remark 5.3 To obtain better regularity results for u, one can apply the regularity

theory for

(−∆Ω)s u = g ∈ Lp(Ω)

in Ω ,

u ∈ eH s(Ω).

In particular, if p > n

2s , then u is H¨older continuous in Ω, see [11, Corollary 3.5].

We conclude this section by giving a suﬃcient condition for the continuity of u.

T:2 Theorem 5.4 Let ψ ∈ C 0(Ω) be a given obstacle, such that K s

ψ is not empty and ψ ≤ 0

on ∂Ω. Let f ∈ Lp(Ω), with p > n/2s. Then u is continuous on Rn.

Proof. The argument is the same as in [20, Theorem 1.2]. Fix a small ε > 0. We can
assume that ψ − ε ∈ C 0
0 (Rn)
such that ψε

0 (Rn) and ψ − ε ≤ 0 outside Ω. Let ψε

h → ψ − ε uniformly on Rn, as h → ∞.

h be a sequence in C ∞

By Theorem 5.2, the solution uh ∈ eH s(Ω) to PΩ(ψε

h ∈ Lp(Ω)
and therefore uε
h is H¨older continuous, see Remark 5.3. Moreover, the estimates in
h → uε uniformly on Ω, where uε solves PΩ(ψ − ε, f ). In
Theorem 4.5 imply that uε
particular, uε ∈ C 0(Ω). Finally, use again Theorem 4.5 to get that uε → u uniformly,
and conclude the proof.

respectively. Here (−∆)s is the ”Dirichlet” (or restricted) Laplacian, that has been
already introduced in (3).

Problem PD(ψ) has been investigated in [20]. Recall that

(−∆Ω)s uN ≥ 0 ,

(−∆)suD ≥ 0

on Ω

(23)

eq:L_positive

in the sense of distributions, see Theorem 4.2 and [20, Theorem 3.2], so that uN , uD are
nonnegative by the maximum principle, and uN , uD ≥ ψ+. Thus, uN , uD solve problems
PN (ψ+), PD(ψ+), respectively. Hence we can assume without loss of generality that
ψ ≥ 0 a.e. in Ω. Since ψ ≡ 0 easily implies uN ≡ uD ≡ 0, we assume also that ψ 6≡ 0.

15

By the strong maximum principle (see, respectively, [7, Lemma 2.4] and [13, Theorem
2.5]) we have

uN > 0 and uD > 0

on Ω,

(24)

eq:u_positive

in the sense that uN , uD are bounded away from 0 on every compact set K ⊂ Ω.

In this section we need to reﬁne the notion of contact set introduced in (22). We
essentially use an idea due to Lewy and Stampacchia [15, 16], see also [14, Section 6].
We start with some preliminaries.

Def Deﬁnition 6.1 Let v be a nonnegative measurable function on the open set Ω, and let

x ∈ Ω. We say that v(x) > 0 if there exist ρ, ε > 0 such that Bρ(x) ⊆ Ω and

v − ε ≥ 0 almost everywhere in Bρ(x) .

For any measurable function v on Ω we deﬁne

P [v] = { x ∈ Ω | v(x) > 0 }

and we put I[v] = Ω \ P [v]. The set P [v] is clearly open; thus I[v] is closed in Ω.

L:meas1 Lemma 6.2 Let v ≥ 0 be a measurable function on Ω and let K ⊂ P [v] be a compact

set. Then there exists ε0 > 0 such that v − ε0 ≥ 0 a.e. on K.

In particular, v > 0 a.e. in P [v].

If K is not empty, for any x ∈ K there exists a ball Bx about x such that
Proof.
Bx ⊂ Ω and v ≥ εx > 0 on Bx. Since K is compact, we can ﬁnd a ﬁnite number of
points xi ∈ K such that K is covered by the ﬁnite family Bxi. Let ε0 = mini εxi. Then
v ≥ ε0 a.e. on K and the ﬁrst claim is proved.

Now put N = {x ∈ P [v] | v(x) = 0}. By the ﬁrst part of the proof, any compact

set K ⊂ N must have null measure. Thus N is a negligile set.

(cid:3)

By Lemma 6.2 we have the inclusions

P [uN − ψ] ⊆ {uN > ψ} , P [uD − ψ] ⊆ {uD > ψ}.

It might happen that {uN > ψ} and {uD > ψ} have positive measure but P [uN − ψ]
and P [uD − ψ] are empty, see Remark 6.4 below.

T:comparing1 Theorem 6.3 The following facts hold true.

i) (−∆Ω)s uN = 0 on P [uN − ψ] and (−∆)suD = 0 on P [uD − ψ];

16

ii) (−∆Ω)s uD > 0 in the distributional sense on Ω;

iii) uN ≤ uD;

iv) uN < uD on P [uN − ψ];

v) uD is the solution to the obstacle problem PD(uN );

are strict, unless uN ≡ uD.

Proof. Fix any nonnegative ϕ ∈ C ∞

0 (P [uN − ψ]). By Lemma 6.2 we have that
ψ for suﬃciently small t ∈ R. Thus ±th(−∆Ω)s uN , ϕi ≥ 0, that proves i)

To prove ii) use [18, Theorem 1], that gives (−∆Ω)s uD > (−∆)suD ≥ 0 by (23).
By b) in Theorem 4.2, we know that uN is the smallest supersolution to (−∆Ω)s v = 0

in the set K s

ψ. Thus uN ≤ uD by ii), and iii) is proved.

On the open set P [uN − ψ] both uN and uD are smooth by i). Assume by contra-
diction that there exists x ∈ P [uN − ψ] such that (uD − uN )(x) = 0. Then from iii) we
see that

(−∆)s(uD − uN )(x) = C · V.P.Z

But this is impossible, as (−∆)s(uD − uN ) > (−∆)suD − (−∆Ω)s uN = 0 on P [uN − ψ]
by [18, Theorem 1] and i). Claim iv) is proved.

To check v) we use [20, Theorem 3.2], that characterizes uD as the smallest super-
uN by iii), we see that uD
uN and the conclusion follows again

PN (ψ) and PD(ψ), respectively, and from variational formulations of these problems,
see (1) and [20, (1.2)] (with f = 0).

R:example Remark 6.4 Take a smooth function η ∈ eH s(Ω) satisfying (−∆)sη ≥ 0, η > 0 in Ω.

Let κ ⊂ Ω be a compact set, having positive measure but empty interior. Consider the
obstacle ψ = ηχΩ\κ and the solutions uN , uD to PN (ψ), PD(ψ), respectively. Clearly

ψ. But then we have η ≥ uD ≥ uN ≥ ψ = ηχΩ\κ. In particular, uD = uN = ψ on
Ω \ κ. Actually {uD = ψ} = {uN = ψ} = Ω \ κ, because uN , uD are positive in Ω. In
particular the sets {uD > ψ}, {uN > ψ} have positive measure as they coincide with κ,
but P [uN − ψ] = P [uD − ψ] = ∅.

R:true Remark 6.5 Suﬃcient conditions in order to have that P [uN − ψ] is not empty can be
easily obtained. For instance, if ψ vanishes on an open set B ⊂ Ω, then B ⊆ P [uN −ψ],
since uN is positive by the strong maximum principle in [7]. If ψ is continuous on Ω
then uN is continuous as well by Theorem 5.4. Thus either uN ≡ ψ, or P [uN − ψ] =
{uN > ψ} is not empty.
