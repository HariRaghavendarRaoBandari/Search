Abstract

In this paper, we alternately obtain the almost sure uniqueness
of the inﬁnite open cluster in bond percolation in Zd, d ≥ 2, without
requiring the use of ergodicity of translation action. If N denotes the
number of inﬁnite open clusters, we use the Burton-Keane argument
to get N ∈ {0, 1, 2} a.s. and then use a pivotal edges argument to
obtain that N ∈ {0, 1} a.s.

Key words: Almost sure uniqueness, inﬁnite open cluster, percola-
tion.

Introduction

Consider the bond percolation on the edge set F of Zd, where every edge
is independently open with probability p and closed otherwise. Here two
vertices w1 = (w1(x1), ..., w1(xd)) and w2 = (w2(x1), ..., w2(xd)) are said to
be adjacent if |w1(xi) − w2(xi)| = 1 for exactly one 1 ≤ i ≤ d. Adjacent
vertices are joined by an edge. We deﬁne the percolation process on the
state space (Ω, F , Pp), where Ω = {0, 1}F.

A path P in Zd is a sequence of vertices (w1, w2, ..., wt) such that wi is
adjacent to wi+1 for every i. We say P is open if all the edges in P ar open.
A set of vertices C ⊂ Zd is called an open cluster if for every z1, z2 ∈ C, there
is an open path from z1 to z2 containing only vertices of C. Let x ∈ Zd be a
vertex and let C(x) denote the largest open cluster containing x; i.e., the set
of all vertices of Zd that are connected to x by an open path. Thus if x1 and
x2 are distinct vertices, we either have C(x1) = C(x2) or C(x1) ∩ C(x2) = ∅.
In the latter case, we say that C(x1) and C(x2) are disjoint since there is no
open path from x1 to x2.

Let N denote the number of disjoint inﬁnite open clusters. Let θ(p) =
Pp(N ≥ 1) denote the probability that there exists an inﬁnite open cluster
and let

pc = inf{p > 0 : θ(p) > 0}

denote the critical probability. We know 0 < pc < 1 (see Chapter 1, Grim-
mett (1999)). We have the following.

Theorem 1. If p < pc, then Pp(N = 0) = 1 and if p > pc, then
Pp(N = 1) = 1.

Our proof uses a direct combination of Burton-Keane argument and piv-
otal edges argument without using ergodicity of the translation action. For
studies on the inﬁnite cluster using ergodicity, we refer to Bollobas and Ri-
ordan (2006) and Grimmett (1999).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we prove Theorem 1.

2 Proof of Theorem 1

Let N denote the number of disjoint inﬁnite clusters. We ﬁrst see that

Pp(N ≥ 3) = 0.

(1)

For this we use the Burton-Keane argument (Chapter 8, Grimmett (1999))
with only the assumption that Pp(N ≥ 3) > 0. Let Vx denote the event that
x ∈ Zd is a trifurcation (for deﬁnitions, please refer to Chapter 8, Grimmett
(1999)). We have the following Proposition.

Proposition 1. If Pp(N ≥ 3) > 0, then Pp(Vx) > 0.

2

We prove all results at the end. Using Proposition 1 and the tripartition
argument (see argument following Lemma 8.5 of Grimmett (1999)), we obtain
the necessary contradiction to get (1).

It only remains to see that Pp(N = 2) = 0 for all p > pc. Suppose
Pp(N = 2) = γ > 0 for some p > pc. We use a pivotal edge argument to
obtain a contradiction.

Let A = {N = 1}. For ω ∈ Ω, we say that edge e is pivotal for (A, ω) if
11A(ω) 6= 11A(ωe), where ωe is the same as ω with the exception that the state
of the edge e is inverted. Here 11A(.) refers to the indicator function of the
event A. Therefore if e is pivotal for (A, ω), we have that ω0 ∈ {N = 2} and
ω1 ∈ A. Here ω0 is the conﬁguration which agrees with ω outside e and e
is closed and ω1 is the conﬁguration which agrees with ω outside e and e is
open. We have the following Lemma. Let e0 denote the edge from the origin
to the point (1, 0, ..., 0).

Lemma 2. If Pp(Ac) = Pp(N = 2) > 0, we have

Pp(e0 is pivotal for A) = ǫ0(p) > 0

and

Pp ({e0 is pivotal for A} ∩ {N = 2}) = ǫ1(p) > 0

(2)

(3)

for some positive constants ǫ0(p) and ǫ1(p).

We prove Lemma 2 at the end. Let

Xn = Xe∈Bn

11(He)

be the number of pivotal edges in the square Bn :=(cid:2)− n

He is the event that edge e is pivotal for A. From Lemma 2 we have that

2 , n

2(cid:3)d of side n. Here

EXn = ndǫ0(p).

(4)

Thus the expected number of pivotal edges in Bn is large.

To obtain a contradiction, we use (4) to see that Bn has large number of
pivotal edges with high probability and therefore the probability that all of
them are closed is very low. For this, we need the following estimate on the
variance of Xn.

Lemma 3. Fix ǫ > 0. We have that var(Xn) ≤ 3ǫn2d for all n large.

3

We use an approximation procedure to prove the above at the end. Using

Chebychev’s inequality, we have

Pp(|Xn − EXn| > δ) ≤

var(Xn)

δ2

.

Letting Kn = − 10 log n
from (4) and Lemma 3 that

log(1−p) , δ = EXn − Kn and choosing ǫ = βǫ2

0(p), we have

Pp(Xn ≤ Kn) ≤

3βǫ2

0(p)n2d

(ǫ0(p)nd − Kn)2 ≤ 4β

(5)

for all n large. Here β > 0 is arbitrary. Thus Bn has at least Kn pivotal
edges with high probability.

To obtain a contradiction using the large number of pivotal edges in (5),
we need the notion of a maximally pivotal set. Let ω ∈ Ω and P = {e1, ..., ek}
be a ﬁnite collection of edges in Bn. Let ΩP = ΩP (ω) be the set of all
conﬁgurations which agree with ω outside P and at least one of the edge in
P is open. Let ω0 be the conﬁguration that agrees with ω outside P and
all edges in P is closed. We say P is a jointly pivotal set in Bn for (A, ω) if
11A(ω0) = 0 and 11A(ω′) = 1 for all ω′ ∈ ΩP . In other words, A occurs if at
least one of the edges in P is open and does not occur otherwise. Therefore
if ω ∈ {P is jointly pivotal for A} then ω0 ∈ {N = 2} and ω′ ∈ A for all
ω′ ∈ ΩP .

We say that P is a maximally pivotal set in Bn for (A, ω) if P is a jointly
pivotal set in Bn for (A, ω) and if e ∈ Bn is any edge not in P, then P ∪ {e}
is not a jointly pivotal set for (A, ω). We note that if P1 and P2 are two
maximally pivotal sets, then either P1 = P2 or P1 ∩ P2 = ∅. Let P1, ..., Pr be
the all the disjoint maximally pivotal sets in Bn. For each edge e ∈ Bn, we
denote Pe to be the maximally pivotal set associated to edge e and deﬁne it
as follows: If there exists some j such that Pj contains e, then set Pe = Pj;
else Pe = ∅.

For a ﬁxed edge e, the following lemma relates Pe and the number of

pivotal edges.

Lemma 4. The maximally pivotal set satisﬁes the two properties:
(i) If ω ∈ {N = 2}, then either Pe(ω) = ∅ or Pe(ω) = En(ω), the set of
pivotal edges of ω in Bn.
(ii) For any non empty ﬁxed set of edges {e1, ..., ek} in Bn, the event Pe =
{e1, ..., ek} is independent of the state of edges in {e1, ..., ek}.

4

We use the above as follows. Using the notation of Lemma 2, let

G0 = {N = 2} ∩ {e0 is pivotal for A}.

We recall e0 is the edge from the origin to (1, 0, ..., 0). From (5), we have

Pp(G0) = Pp(G0 ∩ {Xn > Kn}) + Pp(G0 ∩ {Xn ≤ Kn})

≤ Pp(G0 ∩ {Xn > Kn}) + Pp({Xn ≤ Kn})
≤ Pp(G0 ∩ {Xn > Kn}) + 4β

(6)

using (5).

To estimate the ﬁrst term in (6), we use the notation of Lemma 4 and
let En denote the set of pivotal edges in Bn. Let Pe0 denote the (random)
maximally pivotal set containing e0 in Bn. We have

Pp(G0 ∩ {Xn > Kn}) = Xk>Kn Xe1,...,ek∈Bn
≤ Xk>Kn Xe1,...,ek∈Bn

Pp({En = {e1, ..., ek}} ∩ G0)

Pp({Pe0 = {e1, ..., ek}} ∩ {N = 2})

(7)

since if G0 occurs then {N = 2} occurs and e0 is pivotal for A. Therefore,
from Lemma 4(i), the set Pe0 is precisely the set of pivotal edges. Now if
{N = 2} occurs, then all the edges in Pe0 are closed and thus from (7), we
have

Pp(G0 ∩ {Xn > Kn}) ≤ Xk>Kn Xe1,...,ek∈Bn

Pp({Pe0 = {e1, ..., ek}} ∩ Le1 ∩ ... ∩ Lek )

where Lei is the event that edge ei is closed.

Using Lemma 4(ii), we have for any ﬁxed set of edges e1, ..., ek, the event
{Pe0 = {e1, ..., ek}} is independent of the state of edges e1, ..., ek. Thus we

Pp(Pe0 = {e1, ..., ek})Pp(Le1 ∩ ... ∩ Lek )

Pp(Pe0 = {e1, ..., ek})(1 − p)k

Pp(#Pe0 = k)(1 − p)k

have

Pp(G0 ∩ {Xn > Kn}) ≤ Xk>Kn Xe1,...,ek∈Bn
= Xk>Kn Xe1,...,ek∈Bn
= Xk>Kn
≤ Xk>Kn

(1 − p)k

≤ C1(1 − p)Kn

=

by our choice of Kn for some positive constant C1, independent of n.

From (6) and the above, we have

Pp(G0) = Pp ({e0 is pivotal for A} ∩ {N = 2}) ≤ 4β +

n10

for all β > 0 and all n large. Fixing β > 0 small and n large, this contra-
dicts (3).

Proof of Proposition 1: For integer m ≥ 1, let Fm is the event that
at least three disjoint inﬁnite open clusters in the bond percolation in Bc
m
intersect ∂Bm. Here ∂Bm refers to the boundary of Bm. We then have Fm
is an increasing sequence of events and that {N ≥ 3} ⊂ ∪m≥1Fm. Thus
limm Pp(Fm) ≥ Pp(N ≥ 3) = ǫ > 0.
Fix L large so that Pp(FL) > ǫ

2 . The event FL depends on the conﬁg-
uration outside BL. We then change the conﬁguration inside BL to obtain
Pp(origin is a trifurcation) = ǫ1 > 0.

Proof of Lemma 2: The proof is analogous to the proof of Proposition 1.
For integer m ≥ 1, as in the proof of Proposition 1, let Fm be the event that
there are at least three disjoint inﬁnite open clusters in the bond percolation
in Bc

m intersect ∂Bm. First we see that

Pp(Fm) = 0

(8)

6

for all integers m. Suppose Pp(Fm) > 0 for some m and let Vm denote the
event that all the bonds in Bm are closed. We then have

Pp(N ≥ 3) ≥ Pp(Fm ∩ Vm) = Pp(Fm)Pp(Vm) > 0.

(9)

The last equality is because the events Fm and Vm are independent. Thus
(9) contradicts (1) and so Pp(Fm) = 0 for all m.

For integer m ≥ 1, let Em be the event that at least two disjoint inﬁnite
open clusters in the bond percolation in Bc
m intersect ∂Bm. Again we have
Em is an increasing sequence of events and that {N ≥ 2} ⊂ ∪m≥1Em. From
(1), we thus have

lim
m

Pp(Em) ≥ Pp(N ≥ 2) = Pp(N = 2).

Fix M large so that Pp(EM ) > γ

2 . From (8), we then have

Pp(EM ∩ F c

M ) >

γ
2

.

The event EM ∩F c
M depends on the conﬁguration outside BM . We then change
the conﬁguration inside BM to obtain Pp(e0 is pivotal for A) = ǫ0 > 0. An
analogous proof holds for (3).

Proof of Lemma 3: We have

var(Xn) = E Xe∈Bn
I1 = E Xe∈Bn

11(He) − Pp(He)!2

(11(He) − Pp(He))2

= I1 + I2

(10)

E(11(He1 ∩ He2)) − Pp(He1)Pp(He2).

I2 = Xe16=e2

where

and

We evaluate I1 and I2 separately.

First,

I1 = Xe∈Bn

Pp(He) − (Pp(He))2 ≤ Xe∈Bn

Pp(He) ≤ nd.

(11)

7

To evaluate I2, we ﬁrst rewrite the sum as

I2 = Xe1∈Bn

I2,1(e1) + I2,2(e1)

(12)

where

and

I2,1(e1) =

Xe2∈B ′

3M (e1)∩Bn\{e1}

Pp(He1 ∩ He2) − Pp(He1)Pp(He2)

I2,2(e1) = Xe2∈Bn\B ′

3M (e1)

Pp(He1 ∩ He2) − Pp(He1)Pp(He2).

In the above, B′
as the centre. The integer M is to be determined later.

3M (e1) is the 3M × 3M box with one of the endvertices of e1

Thus I2,1(e1) contains the contribution of the edges within a 3M × 3M
box centred at e1 and I2,2(e1) contains the rest. We upper bound I2,1(e1)
using Pp(He1 ∩ He2) ≤ 1 and so I2,1(e1) ≤ (3M)d. Thus

I2,1(e1) ≤ (3M)dnd.

(13)

Xe1∈Bn

To estimate I2,2(e1), we let x1 and y1 be the endvertices of e1 and note

that

where

He1 ⊆ VM (e1) ∩ QM (x1) ∩ QM (y1) =: TM (e1),

(14)

QM (x1) = {CM (x1) ∩ ∂B′

M (e1) 6= ∅}, QM (y1) = {CM (y1) ∩ ∂B′

M (e1) 6= ∅}

and VM (e1) denotes the event that e1 is pivotal for {CM (x1) = CM (y1)}. Here
CM (x1) = C(x1) ∩ B′
M (e1) denotes the open cluster of x1 contained in the
square B′
M (e1). Also, each event in the intersection on the right hand side
of (14) decreases with M. Therefore setting A12 = {N = 1} ∪ {N = 2}, we
have TM (e1) ∩ A12 ↓ He1. Fix ǫ > 0 small and integer M = M(ǫ) large so
that

Pp(TM (e1)) = Pp(TM (e1) ∩ A12) ≤ Pp(He1) + ǫ.

(15)

Here we use (1). By translational invariance, we know that the choice of M
does not depend on the edge e1.

8

The crucial point is that for every e2 appearing in the summation I2,2(e1),
M (e2) = ∅ and therefore TM (e1) and TM (e2) are

we have that the B′
independent. Therefore we evaluate I2,2(e1) as

M (e1) ∩ B′

I2,2(e1) = Xe2∈Bn\B ′
≤ Xe2∈Bn\B ′
= Xe2∈Bn\B ′
≤ Xe2∈Bn\B ′
= Xe2∈Bn\B ′

where (17) follows from (16) using (14), (19) follows from (18) using (15) and
(21) follows from (20) by using Pp(He1) + Pp(He2) ≤ 2 and ǫ2 < ǫ.

Using (21) and (13) in (12), we have

I2 ≤ (3M)dnd + Xe1∈Bn

3ǫnd = (3M)dnd + 3ǫn2d

(22)

and together with (11) and (10), we have

var(Xn) ≤ nd + (3M)dnd + 3ǫn2d ≤ 4ǫn2d

(23)

for all large n.

Proof of Lemma 4: (i) By deﬁnition, if ω ∈ {N = 2} and Pe 6= ∅, then
e ∈ Pe and all edges in Pe are closed. Let E = E(ω) denote the set of pivotal
edges and let ΩE be the set of conﬁgurations that that agree with ω outside
E and at least one edge in E is open. By deﬁnition of pivotal edge, we have
ω′ ∈ A for every ω′ ∈ ΩE. So E ⊆ Pe. If any edge f ∈ Pe, then IA(ωf ) = 1
and IA(ω) = 0, where ωf is the conﬁguration that is the same as ω except
that the state of edge f is inverted. Thus f is pivotal for (A, ω) and so f ∈ E .
(ii) Let Pe(ω) = {e1, ..., ek}. Every ω ∈ Ω can be written as (ωi, ωo), where
ωi is the k−tuple denoting the state of the edges (e1, ..., ek) and ωo denotes

9

i, ωo) ∈ A for any ω′

the rest. Fix ω = (ωi, ωo) and let ω′ = (ω′
i, ωo). By deﬁnition, (0, ωo) ∈ Ac
and (ω′
i 6= 0. So {e1, ..., ek} is jointly pivotal in ω′. Suppose
there exists an edge f ∈ Bn such that {e1, ..., ek}∪{f } is jointly pivotal in ω′.
In the state ωf = (0, 1, ω′′
o ), all edges in {e1, ..., ek} are closed and f is open
and the state of the rest of the edges is the same as that of ω. By deﬁnition,
ωf ∈ A. But this necessarily means that f ∈ Pe(ω).
