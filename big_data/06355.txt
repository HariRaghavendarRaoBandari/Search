ABSTRACT

Cosmic rays (CRs) in starburst galaxies produce high energy gamma-rays by colliding with the dense inter-
stellar medium (ISM). Arp 220 is the nearest ultra luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) that has star-formation
at extreme levels, so it has long been predicted to emit high-energy gamma-rays. However, no evidence of
gamma-ray emission was found despite intense efforts of search. Here we report the discovery of high-energy
gamma-ray emission above 200 MeV from Arp 220 at a conﬁdence level of ∼ 6.3σ using 7.5 years of Fermi
Large Area Telescope observations. The gamma-ray emission shows no signiﬁcant variability over the obser-
vation period and it is consistent with the quasi-linear scaling relation between the gamma-ray luminosity and
total infrared luminosity for star-forming galaxies, suggesting that these gamma-rays arise from CR interac-
tions. As the high density medium of Arp 220 makes it an ideal CR calorimeter, the gamma-ray luminosity can
be used to measure the efﬁciency of powering CRs by supernova (SN) remnants given a known supernova rate
in Arp 220. We ﬁnd that this efﬁciency is about 4.2 ± 2.6% for CRs above 1 GeV.

1. INTRODUCTION

Nearby star-forming and starburst galaxies have been iden-
tiﬁed to be GeV to TeV gamma-ray sources (Acero et al.
2009; VERITAS Collaboration et al. 2009; Abdo et al. 2010;
Ackermann et al. 2012). Cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated by
supernova remnants therein interact with the interstellar gas
and produce neutral pions (schematically written as p + p →
π0+ other products), which in turn decay into high-energy
gamma-rays (π0 → γ + γ). High energy gamma-ray emission
is thus a powerful tool to diagnose the non-thermal emission
related with CRs in star-forming galaxies.

Arp 220, at a distance of d = 77 Mpc,

is the nearest
ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) with a total
in-
frared luminosity of (1 - 2) × 1012L⊙ (Sanders et al. 2003;
Gao & Solomon 2004; Rangwala et al. 2011). The system is
a merger of two galaxies and contains two dense nuclei sep-
arated by 350 pc. Both nuclei have high star formation rate
and dense molecular gas. Arp 220 has a molecular gas mass
of 1010M⊙ (Scoville et al. 1997) and a total star formation rate
of 240 ±30M⊙/yr, calculated with the far-infrared luminosity
(Farrah et al. 2003). Radio detection of supernovae suggests a
high rate of 4 ± 2/yr (Smith et al. 1998; Lonsdale et al. 2006;
Parra et al. 2007). Although Arp 220 could contain active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) (Paggi et al. 2013; Teng et al. 2015),
the observed high supernova rate indicates that star formation
provides a substantial fraction of the power radiated by the
nuclei.

As a huge reservoir of molecular gas, the nuclei of Arp
220 should be complete proton calorimeters, i.e. the CR pro-
tons lose all of their energy to secondary pions via collisions
with the gases before escaping (Torres 2004; Thompson et al.

2007; Lacki et al. 2011; Yoast-Hull et al. 2015). Given a high
CR emissivity and a high efﬁciency of converting CR energy
into gamma-rays, Arp 220 was predicted to emit GeV to TeV
gamma-rays (Torres 2004; Lacki et al. 2011; Yoast-Hull et al.
2015). There have been intense efforts to search for GeV
emission from Arp 220 (Lacki et al. 2011; Ackermann et al.
2012; Tang et al. 2014). Tang et al. (2014) obtained an up-
per limit F0.1- 100GeV < 3.5 × 10- 9 ph cm- 2 s- 1 at 95% conﬁ-
dence level by using 68 months of Fermi/LAT data. Arp 220
was also observed by the VERITAS telescopes at TeV ener-
gies for more than 30 hours, but no signiﬁcant excess over the
background is found (Fleischhack et al. 2015). Here we re-
port the detection of GeV emission from Arp 220 using 7.5
years of Fermi/LAT data reprocessed with Pass 8, the newest
event-level analysis, which signiﬁcantly improves the accep-
tance and angular resolution of the instrument6.

We present a description of the analysis and show the re-
sults in §2. Then we discuss the origin of the γ-ray emission
(§3) and use it to constrain the cosmic ray acceleration efﬁ-
ciency (§4). Finally we give the conclusions in §5.

2. DATA ANALYSIS
2.1. Data selection

We choose the Fermi/LAT survey data with P8R2
SOURCE event class from 2008-08-04 to 2016-01-22, and
use the current Fermi science tools version v10r0p5 for data
analysis (Atwood et al. 2009). The maximum zenith angle of
< 90◦ is selected to reduce the Earth Limb emission. The data
are ﬁltered with the recommended cuts (DATA_QUAL > 1)
&& (LAT_CONFIG == 1) && ABS(ROCK_ANGLE)< 52◦.
Photons with energy range between 200 MeV and 100 GeV
are taken into consideration. The region of interest (ROI) is
a circle with a radius of 10◦ centered at the position of Arp
220 (i.e., RA = 233.738◦,Dec = 23.5032◦, J2000). We use
the FRONT+BACK converting photons. The 3FGL sources
(Acero et al. 2015) within 15◦ of the ROI center are in-
cluded in the source model. The galactic diffuse emission

and isotropic emission are modeled with "gll_iem_v06.ﬁts"
and "iso_P8R2_SOURCE_V6_v06.txt" respectively. We also
consider the CLEAN data and binned method to check our
results and no statistical difference is found.

2.2. Spatial and Spectral Analysis

We start with a preliminary unbinned likelihood anal-
ysis on the ROI with the tool gtlike, only including
"gll_iem_v06.ﬁts", "iso_P8R2_SOURCE_V6_v06.txt" and
point sources of 3FGL within 15◦ from the ROI center in the
source model ﬁle. The residual test-statistic (TS) under this
scenario is shown in the left panel of Fig. 1, which shows a
gamma-ray excess around Arp 220. We add one point source
with a power-law spectrum at the local maxima of the TS map
in the source model ﬁle. We re-ﬁt the data and ﬁnd the best-
ﬁt γ-ray emission position with the tool gtﬁndsrc. We then
change the position of the point source to the obtained best-ﬁt
location of γ-ray emission in the source model ﬁle. Repeating
the standard analysis threads and computing the TS map, al-
though getting a signiﬁcantly improved ﬁt, we note that there
is still some residual emission to the northwest of the ROI
center.
In order to explore the high energy emission more
accurately near Arp 220 and reduce the contamination from
nearby background sources, a second point source is added to
the source model based on the residual γ-ray emission. By
utilizing the tool gtﬁndsrc, we optimize the position of these
two point source, namely, P1 (233.677◦,23.5163◦) ± 0.054◦
which is near Arp 220 and P2 (233.239◦,23.8049◦) ± 0.168◦
which locates at a position about 0.5◦ away from Arp 220, as
marked in Fig 1. Next, we re-ﬁt the data with point sources
P1 and P2 in the source model ﬁle, and get a better result with
∆ Likelihood = 8 (i.e. we get a global improved ﬁtting with
signiﬁcance TS = 16), in comparison with that only one point
source is added into the source model ﬁle. The signiﬁcance
of TSP2 = 22 suggests that P2 should be a genuine additional
γ-ray source. The bottom panel in Fig. 1 illustrates that there
is little residual γ-ray emission near the vicinity of Arp 220
region. The source model ﬁle including point source P1 and
P2 will be used in all the subsequent analysis.

We now check possible alternative candidates for P1 and
P2 in the following catalogs: CRATES Flat-Spectrum Ra-
dio Source Catalog (Healey et al. 2007), Veron Catalog of
Quasars & AGN, 13th Edition (Véron-Cetty&Véron 2010)
and Candidate Gamma-Ray Blazar Survey Source Catalog
(Healey et al. 2008). No other sources are found in the vicin-
ity of r95 of P1 except for Arp 220. With only a separation
of 0.058◦ between P1 and Arp 220, it is reasonable to ascribe
the high energy emission from P1 to Arp 220. By contrast,
the separation between P2 and Arp 220 reaches 0.547◦ and
there are four candidates around r95 of P2 in the above three
catalogs: CRATES J153246+234400 (4.902′), a FSRQ with
unknown redshift; SDSS J15323+2345 (9.080′), a QSO with
redshﬁt z = 1.465; SDSS J15337+2358 (14.643′), a Seyfert 1
galaxy with z = 0.067; and 1WGA J1533.8+2356 (15.315′),
an AGN of unknown type located at z = 0.232. Values in
the parentheses are the angular offsets of these sources from
P2. We suspect that the gamma-ray emission from P2 is con-
tributed by one or more of these AGNs.

We assume power-law spectra in the range of 0.2-100 GeV
for both P1 and P2 in the aforementioned best source model
ﬁles. The best-ﬁt photon index for emissions of P1 is Γ1 =
2.35 ± 0.16 with a total ﬂux of F1 = 1.76 ± 0.52 × 10- 9 ph
cm- 2 s- 1. Regarding P2, the photon index is Γ2 = 2.45 ± 0.19

and the total ﬂux is F2 = 1.45 ± 0.52 × 10- 9 ph cm- 2 s- 1. The
corresponding energy ﬂux in 0.2-100 GeV are 1.92 ± 0.43 ×
10- 12 erg cm- 2 s- 1 and 1.39 ± 0.40 × 10- 12 erg cm- 2 s- 1 for
P1 and P2, respectively. The spatial and spectral results of
P1 and P2 are summarized in Table 1. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) of P1 (Arp 220) is shown in Fig. 2. We do
not discuss P2 further in this paper since the topic is on the
gamma-ray emission from Arp 220.

3. ORIGIN OF THE GAMMA-RAY EMISSION FROM ARP 220
Gamma-ray emissions in star-forming galaxies are usually
thought to originate from cosmic ray protons via collision
with the gases inside the galaxies. This may be especially
the case with Arp 220 as it has a high supernova rate and
high gas density. Alternatively, Arp 220 could have hidden
AGNs(Paggi et al. 2013; Teng et al. 2015), which in princi-
ple could give rise to gamma-ray emission as well. CR-
induced gamma-ray emission in a star-forming galaxy is ex-
pected to be stable, while gamma-ray emission induced by
AGNs should be temporally variable (Gasparrini et al. 2015).
Thus, we examine the ﬂux variability of Arp 220 (P1). We
create a set of time bins for the light curve of photons with
energy > 400 MeV. In the ﬁrst trial, the full observation pe-
riod is divided linearly into 5 equal time bins. Each time bin
is ﬁtted by a separate maximum likelihood analysis, resulting
in each bin with detection signiﬁcance TS > 4. We further
check a ﬁner light curve with 12 time bins. The χ2 goodness-
of-ﬁt test is consistent with a constant ﬂux with a reduced χ2
of 0.83 for data points with detection signiﬁcance TS > 1. The
results is shown in Fig 2. None of the two cases show signif-
icant changes in ﬂux over the period of LAT observations 7.
Generally speaking, the temporal behavior of GeV emission
from Arp 220 resembles that of other starburst galaxies, such
as M82 and NGC 253.

Meanwhile, there is a clear positive empirical relation be-
tween the γ-ray luminosity L0.1- 100GeV and total infrared lu-
minosity L8- 1000µm in local group galaxies and nearby star-
forming galaxies8(Ackermann et al. 2012). With a pure sam-
ple of star-forming galaxies, Tang et al. (2014) have drawn a
similar relation and extended the relation to a luminous in-
frared galaxy NGC 2146. The best simple linear ﬁt for nearby
star-forming galaxies excluding Arp 220 gives a relation of

log(cid:18) L0.1- 100GeV

erg s- 1 (cid:19) = α + βlog(cid:18) L8- 1000µm
erg s- 1 (cid:19).

(1)

(see Fig. 3), where α = - 14.98 ± 4.87 and β = 1.24 ± 0.11 are
the intercept and slope respectively. The Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient is 0.98 with a chance probability of p ∼ 10- 4. With
a luminosity of L0.1- 100GeV = 1.78 ± 0.30 × 1042 erg s- 1, Arp
220 is consistent with this quasi-linear relation. It is also con-
sistent with the scaling relation between the gamma-ray lumi-
nosity and radio luminosity found for star-forming galaxies
(Ackermann et al. 2012). The fact that the gamma-ray emis-
sion has no signiﬁcant variability over the observation period
and it is consistent with the above scaling relation suggests

7 The gamma-ray excess indicated by the P7 data in Tang et al. (2014)
locates at a position within r95 of P2, so this excess has nothing to do with
Arp 220 (P1). The source of this gamma-ray excess in Tang et al. (2014) was
likely FSRQ CRATES J 153246+234400, which shows variability.

8 Although the origin of high energy emission of two starbursting Seyfert
2 galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 4945 are not yet deﬁnitely established, lack
of γ-ray variability and the consistent behavior with this correlation favor a
CR origin.

that the gamma-ray emission is likely to arise from CR inter-
actions.

4. MEASURING THE CR ACCELERATION EFFICIENCY

As the ejecta of a SN encounters the ambient ISM, a strong
shock will be generated and a fraction of the kinetic energy of
the ejecta will be transferred into cosmic rays. The gamma-
ray luminosity of a galaxy depends on both the efﬁciency
of converting SN kinetic energy to cosmic rays and the ef-
ﬁciency of converting CR energy to gamma rays (i.e., the
proton-proton collision efﬁciency). Because of the very dense
ISM in Arp 220, it has been widely suggested that Arp 220 is
an ideal proton calorimeter, since the collisional energy loss
time of CR protons is much shorter than the time that CRs
escape out of the galaxy (Lacki et al. 2011; Yoast-Hull et al.
2015). Then its gamma-ray luminosity provides a direct tool
to measure the efﬁciency that SN explosion power goes into
high-energy CRs.

Assuming that SNRs are the sole source of CR protons, and
that a constant fraction (η) of SN kinetic energy is transferred
into CR protons with energy above 1 GeV, the total injected
CR power reads

LCR(> 1GeV) = 1.3 × 1044erg s- 1E51η(cid:18) ΓSN

4 yr- 1(cid:19) ,

(2)

where E is the SN kinetic energy, which is typically 1051erg,
and ΓSN = 4 ± 2/yr is the SN rate obtained by the radio obser-
vations (Smith et al. 1998; Lonsdale et al. 2006; Parra et al.
2007). On the other hand, by assuming that the system
reaches a steady state, one can derive the injected CR power
from the observed gamma-ray luminosity. As leptonic emis-
sion is expected to become increasingly important at lower
energies, contaminating the estimate of the power in CR pro-
tons, we only consider the γ-ray emission above 1 GeV. Then
we have

LCR(> 1GeV) = 3Lγ(> 1GeV)(Γ - 1)β

- 1
π .

(3)

Here the prefactor 3 is due to that only 1/3 of the lost CR
power goes into gamma-rays, as inelastic proton-proton col-
lisions produce both neutral and charged pions. The factor
Γ - 1 arises from the fact that a fraction (Γ - 2)/(Γ - 1) of
the energy of CRs above 1 GeV is transferred to lower en-
ergy CRs, where Γ is the CR spectral index, which is equal
to the photon index of the gamma-ray emission in our case.
Since not all the pionic gamma rays produced by CRs will
have energies above 1 GeV, we need another correction factor
≃ 0.6 (for Γ = - 2.35) to account for this effect (Lacki et al.
βπ

2011). Given that the luminosity of Arp 220 above 1 GeV is
Lγ(> 1GeV) = (0.75 ± 0.28) × 1042 erg s- 1, we can obtain the
CR acceleration efﬁciency from Eqs. 2 and 3, i.e.

η ≃ (4.2 ± 2.6)%E- 1

0.6(cid:19)
51(cid:18) βπ

- 1

- 1(cid:18) ΓSN
4yr- 1(cid:19)

.

(4)

Note that here only the uncertainties in ΓSN and Lγ(> 1GeV)
are taken into consideration to estimate the uncertainty in η.
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that such an efﬁciency
is obtained directly from the gamma-ray observations. The
obtained efﬁciency in Arp 220 is consistent with estimates of
a 3-10% efﬁciency in the Milky Way (Strong et al. 2010) and
a 6% efﬁciency in NGC 253 and M82 (Paglione & Abrahams
2012).

5. CONCLUSIONS

Through analysis of 7.5 years of Fermi/LAT observations,
we ﬁnd high-energy gamma-ray emission above 200 MeV
from Arp 220 with a detection signiﬁcance about 6.3σ. This
is the ﬁrst time detection of GeV emission from an ULIRG.
The reconstructed energy spectrum is best modeled by a sin-
gle power law with photons index Γ = 2.35 ± 0.16 and the in-
tegrated ﬂux in 0.2-100 GeV is F0.2- 100GeV = (1.76 ± 0.52) ×
10- 9 ph cm- 2 s- 1. The fact that no evidence of signiﬁcant
variability is found and that the gamma-ray emission is con-
sistent with some scaling relations for star-forming galaxies
implies that the gamma-ray emission of Arp 220 is likely from
CR-induced diffuse emission. As Arp 220 is an ideal proton
calorimeter, the gamma-ray luminosity can be used to directly
measure the CR acceleration efﬁciency by SNRs, which gives
an efﬁciency of 4.2 ± 2.6% for CRs above 1 GeV.

FIG. 2.— Upper: Fermi/LAT (0.4-100 GeV) light curves of P1 (Arp 220). The blue (cyan) data points indicate the light curve for ﬁve (twelve) time bins. The
red dashed line illustrates the maximum likelihood ﬂux level for the ∼ 7.5 years observations; Bottom: The spectral energy distribution of P1 (Arp 220). Upper
limits of two blue data points are at 95% conﬁdence level. The red dashed line illustrates the best-ﬁt power-law spectral model in 0.2-100 GeV with the unbinned
analysis. The black data point is derived from the integral upper limit ﬂux observed by VERITAS (Fleischhack et al. 2015).

FIG. 3.— Gamma-ray luminosity (0.1-100 GeV) vs. total infrared luminosity (8-1000 µm) for LAT-detected star-forming galaxies and Seyferts. The red solid
line is the best-ﬁt power-law relation for star-forming galaxies only (black ﬁlled circles). Two dotted lines represent its 95% conﬁdence level region around the
best ﬁt. Arp 220, marked with blue ﬁlled circle, lies on the extrapolation of this relation to higher luminosity. The total infrared luminosity data are taken from
Gao & Solomon (2004), and γ-ray luminosities are taken from Ackermann et al. (2012) and Tang et al. (2014).
