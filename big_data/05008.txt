Fractionalised excitations that emerge from a
many body system have revealed rich physics
and concepts, from composite fermions in two-
dimensional electron systems, revealed through
the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect1, to spinons
in antiferromagnetic chains2 and, more recently,
fractionalisation of Dirac electrons in graphene3
and magnetic monopoles in spin ice4. Even more
surprising is the fragmentation of the degrees of
freedom themselves,
leading to coexisting and
a priori independent ground states. This puz-
zling phenomenon was recently put forward in
the context of spin ice, in which the magnetic
moment ﬁeld can fragment, resulting in a dual
ground state consisting of a ﬂuctuating spin liq-
uid, a so-called Coulomb phase5, on top of a
magnetic monopole crystal6. Here we show, by
means of neutron scattering measurements, that
such fragmentation occurs in the spin ice candi-
date Nd2Zr2O7. We observe the spectacular co-
existence of an antiferromagnetic order induced
by the monopole crystallisation and a ﬂuctuat-
ing state with ferromagnetic correlations. Exper-
imentally, this fragmentation manifests itself via
the superposition of magnetic Bragg peaks, char-
acteristic of the ordered phase, and a pinch point
pattern, characteristic of the Coulomb phase.
These results highlight the relevance of the frag-
mentation concept to describe the physics of sys-
tems that are simultaneously ordered and ﬂuctu-
ating.

The physics of spin ice materials is intimately con-
nected with the pyrochlore lattice, made of corner shar-
ing tetrahedra. On the corners of these tetrahedra re-
side rare-earth magnetic moments (cid:126)Ji of size µ, which,
as a consequence of the strong crystal electric ﬁeld, are
constrained to point along their local trigonal axes (cid:126)zi,
and behave like Ising spins. The magnetic interactions
are made of nearest-neighbour exchange J and dipolar

When the eﬀective interaction Jeﬀ = (−J + 5D) /3 is
positive, i.e. when the dipolar term overcomes the an-
tiferromagnetic exchange, a very unusual magnetic state
develops, the spin ice state. The system remains in a
highly correlated but disordered ground state where the
local magnetisation fulﬁlls the so-called “ice rule”: each
tetrahedron has two spins pointing in and two out (see
Figure 1(a)), in close analogy with the rule which con-
trols the hydrogen position in water ice8. The extensive
degeneracy of this ground state results in a residual en-
tropy at low temperature which is well-approximated by
the Pauling entropy for water ice9.

Such highly degenerate states where the organising
principle is dictated by a local constraint belong to the
class of Coulomb phases5,10,11: the constraint (the ice
rule for spin ice), can be interpreted as a divergence
free condition of an emergent gauge ﬁeld. This ﬁeld has
correlations that fall oﬀ with distance like the dipolar
interaction12,13. In reciprocal space, this power-law char-
acter leads to bow tie singularities, called pinch points,
in the magnetic structure factor. They form a key exper-
imental signature of the Coulomb phase physics. They
have been observed by neutron diﬀraction in the spin ice
materials Ho2Ti2O7 and Dy2Ti2O7 , in excellent agree-
ment with theoretical predictions14,15.

Classical excitations above the spin ice manifold are
defects that locally violate the ice rule and so the diver-
gence free condition: by reversing the orientation of a
moment, “three in - one out” and “one in - three out”
conﬁgurations are created (see Figure 1(b)). Consider-
ing the Ising spins as dumbbells with two opposite mag-
netic charges at their extremities, such defects result in a

a magnetic monopole, that give rise to a non-zero diver-
gence of the local magnetisation4.

2 {1, 1, 1, 1} + 1

Recently, theoreticians have introduced the concept
of magnetic moment fragmentation6, whereby the local
magnetic moment ﬁeld fragments into the sum of two
parts, a divergence full and a divergence free part (see
Figure 1(c)): for example, a monopole in the spin conﬁg-
uration m = {1, 1, 1,−1} on a tetrahedron can be written
2 {1, 1, 1,−3}. In this decomposition,
m = 1
the ﬁrst term carries the total magnetic charge of the
monopole. If the monopoles organise as a crystal of al-
ternating magnetic charges, the fragmentation leads to
the superposition of an ordered “all in - all out” conﬁgu-
ration (Figure 1(d)) and of an emergent Coulomb phase
associated with the divergence free contribution (Figure
1(e)).

This monopole

crystallisation occurs when the
monopole density is high enough so that the Coulomb

It thus obeys a di-

and forms a new kind of Coulomb phase. The same ar-
gument can be made for the other magnetic conﬁgurations
m+ = {1, 1,−1, 1} ,{1,−1, 1, 1}, or {−1, 1, 1, 1} (and associ-
ated m−). The divergence full contribution remains identi-
cal while the position of the magenta 3/2 component that

gerprint of the degeneracy.

pseudo spin 1/2 model described by equation 3, with J (cid:48) = 1.2 K and K = −0.55 K. Note that the same dispersion curve is
obtained with a ferro octopolar coupling K = +1.65 K: the sign of the octopolar coupling does not aﬀect the physics of the
spin model. The factor of three between the antiferro and ferro octopolar coeﬃcients is due to the molecular ﬁeld amplitude of
the octopolar phase, the “all in - all-out” molecular ﬁeld being three times larger than the “two in - two out” one.

interaction between monopoles (which originates in the
dipolar interaction between magnetic moments) is min-
imised through charge ordering, while the remaining ﬂuc-
tuating divergence free part provides a gain in entropy.

The necessary conditions for an experimental realisa-
tion of this physics are severe:
in pyrochlore systems,
the fragmentation is expected in the case of strong Ising
anisotropy combined with eﬀective ferromagnetic inter-
actions, and for a speciﬁc ratio between the dipolar and
exchange interactions in order to form the crystal of
monopoles. If fragmentation occurs, the theory predicts
that the magnetic structure factor should exhibit both
Bragg peaks characteristic of the “all in - all out” struc-
ture and a pinch point pattern typical of a Coulomb
phase6.

The pyrochlore system Nd2Zr2O7 is a good candi-
date in the search for such a system. Previous stud-
ies have provided evidence for the strong Ising char-
acter of the Nd3+ ion, and for ferromagnetic interac-
tions, inferred from the positive Curie-Weiss temperature
θCW = 195 mK16. Moreover, Nd2Zr2O7 orders below
TN = 285 mK in an “all in - all out” state carrying a
reduced ordered magnetic moment of about one third of
the total Nd3+ magnetic moment µeﬀ = 2.4 µB
17 (See
Supplementary Information).

To demonstrate that the fragmentation occurs in
it is essential to observe signatures of the

Nd2Zr2O7,

Coulomb phase. To this end, neutron scattering experi-
ments have been carried out as a function of temperature
and magnetic ﬁeld on a large single crystal. As shown in
Figure 2(a), the key point here is that the neutron data
do exhibit at 60 mK arm like features along the (00(cid:96)) and
(hhh) directions, with pinch points at the (002) and (111)
positions, expected in the Coulomb phase6. This pinch
point pattern is observed simultaneously with the “all
in - all out” Bragg peaks17,18 at (220) and (113), which
we interpret as evidence for fragmentation and monopole
crystallisation.

Importantly, this structured neutron scattering signal
appears as a ﬂat mode at ﬁnite energy around Eo =
70 µeV (see Figures 3 top and 4(a) and (b)). In addi-
tion, above this ﬂat mode, collective dispersive excita-
tions stem from the pinch points and not from the anti-
ferromagnetic “all in - all out” wave vectors (see Figure 3
top). They are characterised by a spin gap ∆ ≈ Eo and
reach a maximum energy of about 0.25 meV.

When increasing the temperature, the pinch point pat-
tern and the collective modes persist up to 600 mK, far
above the antiferromagnetic ordering (TN = 285 mK)
(see Supplementary Information). While the energy gap,
and the intensity of these features, decrease as the tem-
perature increases (see Figure 4(a)), the energy range
of the dispersion remains unaﬀected up to 450 mK. This
temperature dependence suggests a scenario in which the

cooling in an “all in - all out” phase at TN, leaving the
Coulomb phase unchanged. The ﬁeld dependence is con-
sistent with this scenario (see Figure 4(b) and (c)): at
an applied ﬁeld of 0.15 T, where magnetisation measure-
ments show that the “all in - all out” state is replaced
by a ﬁeld induced ordered state17, the Coulomb phase
characteristics remain, albeit with less intensity. This
observation further conﬁrms the fragmentation scenario
in which the divergence free and full parts of the magnetic
moment ﬁeld behave independently.

This peculiar spin dynamics, and especially the exis-
tence of dispersive modes, are puzzling in an Ising-like
system. They call for the existence of additional trans-
verse terms in the Hamiltonian given in equation 2. To
address this point, the magnetic moments should not be
considered as Ising variables, but as pseudo spin half σi
spanning the | ↑↓(cid:105) crystalline electric ﬁeld (CEF) doublet
states.

Considering the very peculiar “dipolar-octopolar” na-
ture of the Kramers Nd3+ doublet17,19–21 such trans-
verse terms arise from a coupling between octopolar

those CEF properties, it can be shown using the explicit
wave functions determined in Ref. 17 that the octopole
T = i(J +J +J +−J−J−J−) is the relevant operator since
(cid:104)↑ |T | ↓(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0. Introducing an octopole-octopole coupling
<i,j> κ Ti Tj, where κ denotes the strength of the
octopolar coupling, and projecting it onto the pseudo
spin 1/2 subspace leads to:

where σy,z are the pseudo spin components in the local

gJ = 8/11 and gx = gy = 0, gz = 4.5.
The Hamiltonian parameters J (cid:48) and K can be esti-
mated by ﬁtting the inelastic neutron scattering spectra.
From calculations in the Random Phase Approximation
(RPA)22–25 (see Supplementary Information), it is found
that the bandwidth of the collective modes is related to
J (cid:48) while the shift of the pinch point pattern up to Eo
is induced by the transverse term K. This is reminiscent
of the role of the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction which lifts the “weathervane” ﬂat mode in
kagome systems up to ﬁnite energy26. Such transverse
terms might also be at the origin of the inelastic pattern

The best agreement is obtained for J (cid:48) = 1.2 K and
K = −0.55 K (see Figures 2(b) and 3 bottom). For these
values, the RPA ground state is an ordered octopolar
phase.
It is worth noting that, while this RPA calcu-
lation accounts for the behaviour of the divergence free
part of the magnetic moment, it is unable to capture the
fragmentation mechanism.

We have thus shown that the predicted fragmentation

fragmentation takes place well above TN: at the tem-
perature where the ferromagnetic correlations start to
develop, a Coulomb phase arises in coexistence with a
liquid of monopoles. The latter ﬁnally crystallises upon

process6 exists in the spin ice material Nd2Zr2O7. Be-
low 700 mK, the magnetic moment ﬁeld fragments into
two parts: a divergence full part which crystallises at
TN = 285 mK, and a divergence free part for which
transverse terms induce gapped and dispersive excita-
tions. Our results highlight that the two fragments be-
have independently as a function of ﬁeld and tempera-
ture, which opens the appealing possibility of manipu-
lating them separately.

Indeed,

Beyond the classical fragmentation theory described in
Ref. 6, the importance of transverse terms to describe our
observations emphasises the need for considering quan-
tum eﬀects in further theoretical studies.
in
the classical scheme, the crystallisation occurs when the
energy required to create the assembly of fragmented
monopoles is balanced by the repulsive energy among
them and thus depends on the competition between ex-
change and dipolar interactions.
In the present case,
transverse octopolar couplings might enhance the inter-
actions between monopoles thus promoting their crys-
tallisation. We thus anticipate that our experiment will
pave the way towards a quantum theory of fragmenta-
tion, involving such tranverse terms.

In a broader context, the fragmentation theory relies
on the Helmholtz decomposition of a charged ﬁeld, widely
used to describe continuous ﬂuid media in a large vari-
ety of ﬁelds, from ﬂuid mechanics to robotics28. This
decomposition allows to identify new relevant degrees of
freedom, which could not have been separated otherwise.
Our results in Nd2Zr2O7 point out its applicability to de-
scribe, more generally, localized moment systems where
ﬂuctuating and ordered phases coexist. This might cover
the case of the pyrochlore compound Yb2Ti2O7, a sys-
tem showing a strongly reduced ferromagnetic ordering29
and a peculiar ﬂuctuation spectrum, and whose physics is
likely governed by competing phases25,30. In spin ice, the
Helmholtz decomposition is applied at a microscopic level
on the emergent gauge ﬁeld of the Coulomb phase and
on its charges, the monopoles. Our experimental ﬁndings
give a concrete form to these concepts. The observation
of fragmentation in Nd2Zr2O7 will thus stimulate new
conceptual approaches in physical systems where such

5

emergent ﬁelds exist.

METHODS

Single crystals of Nd2Zr2O7 were grown by the
ﬂoating-zone technique using a four-mirror xenon arc
lamp optical image furnace16,31.
Inelastic neutron scattering experiments were carried out
at the Institute Laue Langevin (ILL, France) on the IN5
disk chopper time of ﬂight spectrometer and operated
with λ = 8.5 ˚A or λ = 6 ˚A. The Nd2Zr2O7 single crys-
tal sample was attached to the cold ﬁnger of a dilution
insert and the ﬁeld was applied along [1 -1 0]. The data
were processed with the Horace software, transforming
the recorded time of ﬂight, sample rotation and scatter-
ing angle into energy transfer and Q-wave-vectors.
The neutron diﬀraction data were taken at the D23 sin-
gle crystal diﬀractometer (CEA-CRG, ILL France) with
a copper monochromator and using λ = 1.28 ˚A. Here the
ﬁeld was applied along the [111] direction. Reﬁnements
were carried out with the Fullprof software suite32.
The magnetic diﬀuse scattering was measured on the D7
diﬀractometer installed at the ILL, with λ = 4.85 ˚A,
using standard polarization analysis technique with the
guiding ﬁeld along the vertical axis [1 -1 0].
Calculations are carried out on the basis of a mean ﬁeld
treatment of a Hamiltonian taking into account the dipo-
lar exchange as well as an octopolar coupling between the
CEF ground doublet states of the Nd3+ ion. This Hamil-
tonian is written in terms of a pseudo spin 1/2 spanning
these states. The spin dynamics is then calculated nu-
merically in the Random Phase Approximation22–25.
More details are provided in the Supplementary Informa-
tion.

I. METHODS

A. Sample preparation

lations, integrating the dynamical response observed at
IN5 up to an energy transfer equal to 3.5 meV.

Single crystals of Nd2Zr2O7 were grown by the
ﬂoating-zone technique using a four-mirror xenon arc
lamp optical image furnace (CSI FZ-T-12000-X VI- VP,
Crystal Systems, Inc., Japan) S1,S2. The growths were
carried out in air at ambient pressure and at growth
speeds in the range 10 - 15 mm/h. The two rods (feed
and seed) were counter-rotated at a rate of 20 - 30 rpm.
The crystals were aligned using a Laue X-ray imaging
system with a Photonic-Science Laue camera.

B. Neutron scattering experiments

Inelastic neutron scattering experiments were carried
out on the IN5 disk chopper time of ﬂight spectrometer
operated by the Institute Laue Langevin (France). Dif-
ferent wavelengths λ = 8.5 ˚A and λ = 6 ˚A were used
depending on the desired energy resolution (about 20
and 40 µeV respectively). The Nd2Zr2O7 single crys-
tal sample was attached to the cold ﬁnger of a dilution
insert, and placed in a vertical magnet with a maxi-
mum ﬁeld of 2.5 T. The sample was mounted in order
to have the (hh0) and (00(cid:96)) reciprocal directions in the
horizontal scattering plane. The ﬁeld was thus applied
along [1 -1 0]. The data were processed with the Ho-
race softwareS3, transforming the recorded time of ﬂight,
sample rotation and scattering angle into energy transfer
and Q-wave-vectors. The oﬀset of the sample rotation
was determined based on the Bragg peaks positions. In
all experiments, the sample was rotated by steps of 1
degree, covering a total range of 130 degrees. The count-
ing time was about 10 minutes per angle value. When
appropriate, the data have been symmetrised.

The neutron diﬀraction data were collected using
the D23 single crystal diﬀractometer (CEA-CRG, ILL
France) operated with a copper monochromator and us-
ing λ = 1.28 ˚A. The sample was mounted on a dilution
stick placed in a 6 T vertical cryomagnet, this vertical di-
rection corresponding to the [111] direction of the crystal.
Reﬁnements were carried out with the Fullprof software
suiteS4.

The magnetic diﬀuse scattering was measured on the
D7 diﬀractometer installed at ILL, with a wavelength
λ = 4.85 ˚A and using standard polarization analysis tech-
nique with the guiding ﬁeld along the vertical axis [1 -1 0]
of the sample. Maps at 10 K have been subtracted from
the low temperature data to eliminate the background.
Those maps are consistent with the IN5 data. Note that
the diﬀraction technique measures instantaneous corre-

II. MAGNETIC STRUCTURE

A series of Bragg peak intensities was collected at
1.5 K and 50 mK and for various ﬁelds applied up to
8 T. At 1.5 K, the data are in agreement with the pub-
lished pyrochlore structure (Fd¯3m space group) with the
48f oxygen positions determined by the parameter x =
0.337 ± 0.002 S2. The magnetic contribution increases
below TN on top of those crystalline peaks. The Full-
prof reﬁnement of the magnetic structure conﬁrms prior
powder diﬀraction resultsS5 and shows that Nd2Zr2O7
orders in the “all in - all-out” (AIAO) structure, see Fig-
ure S1. The reﬁned ordered Nd3+ magnetic moment is
(0.8 ± 0.1)µB.

FIG. S 1.
(Left) Joint reﬁnement of the crystal and magnetic
neutron structure factors at 60 mK. (Right) Crystal reﬁne-
ment at 1.5 K.

It is worth noting that the transition temperature of
the N´eel order depends on the nature of the sample: it is
slightly larger (TN ∼ 400 mK) in the powder samplesS5,S6
than in the single crystal (TN ∼ 285 mK). A similar be-
haviour has been observed in other pyrochlore systems
S7, and was ascribed to the crystalline
such as Yb2Ti2O7
quality of the samples, which is supposed to be better
in polycrystalline samples. In the studies we have per-
formed, despite a diﬀerent N´eel temperature, the mag-
netic properties of the powder sample and single crystal
are similar, especially the existence of a partial ordered
moment. The presence of structural defects might aﬀect
the fragmentation process and thus the ordering temper-
ature. Nevertheless, the scattering pattern characteristic
of ice-like correlations persists up to 600 mK, far above
the N´eel temperature of all samples.

III. TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE

The maps performed on D7 allow to observe both the
spin-ice pattern along with the AIAO Bragg peaks, espe-
cially (220) and (113).

Figure 2 shows the magnetic neutron intensity inte-
grated over a small region around (220) as well as over a
sector delineating the arm along (hhh) (i.e. the direction
of the (111) pinch point), between 35 and 55 degrees.
These data show that the Bragg intensity disappears at
TN, between 300 and 450 mK, while the spin-ice pattern
persists above TN, up to 600 mK and becomes barely
observable only above 750 mK.

Interestingly, the intensity of the arms seems to be
maximum around 300 mK. Further analysis is in progress
to conﬁrm this eﬀect, and understand it.

clearly observed for energies slightly below Eo; indeed,
at Eo, they are blurred by the contribution that arises
from the dispersing branches because of the energy res-
olution. With increasing energy, the top of the band
appears at the (113) and (220)-like Q-positions. Figure
S3 also shows the corresponding calculations carried out
in the model given by Eq. (e) (see below).

V. FIELDS AND HELMHOLTZ

DECOMPOSITION

The decomposition of a vector ﬁeld into divergence
free and divergence full parts is called the Helmholtz
decomposition.
It is very general and is commonly
used in ﬂuid mechanics and electromagnetismS8. More
precisely, it states that a vector ﬁeld (cid:126)V can be written
(cid:126)V = (cid:126)∇ × (cid:126)A − (cid:126)∇ψ where (cid:126)A and ψ are vector and scalar
ﬁelds respectively. As (cid:126)∇.((cid:126)∇ × (cid:126)A) ≡ 0, the ﬁrst term
of this decomposition is divergence free, while the sec-
ond is not, with (cid:126)∇.(cid:126)∇ψ = ∆ψ but is curl free (cid:126)∇× (cid:126)∇ψ ≡ 0.

In the context of Ising spins on the pyrochlore lat-
tice, the spin state of a tetrahedron can be described
by {s1, s2, s3, s4} using the convention si = 1 for
a spin pointing in and −1 for a spin pointing out.
The divergence free condition can be expressed as

(cid:80)

i=1,2,3,4 si = 0.

As a result, the “2 in - 2 out” conﬁgurations of the spin
ice state do not carry any charge and are divergence
(cid:80)
free. A single magnetic excitation creating a magnetic
is charged with(cid:80)
monopole “3 in - 1 out” or “3 in - 1 out” is charged with
i=1,2,3,4 si = ±2, while an “all in - all-out” tetrahedron
In the fragmentation theoryS9, the vector ﬁeld of
(cid:80)
the monopole state is decomposed between an “all in -
all-out” fragmented ﬁeld of half amplitude, giving rise to
i=1,2,3,4 si = ±2 and a divergence free fragment where
the sum of the fragmented components is indeed zero
(for instance 1

i=1,2,3,4 si = ±4.

2 {1, 1, 1,−3}).

The Helmholtz decomposition allows one to “reword”
the problem in terms of new ﬁelds or new variables. De-
pending on the Hamiltonian, diﬀerent regimes can then
be expected, where the fragments would behave inde-
pendently or not. In the classical fragmentation theory
described in Ref. S 9, although the crystallisation de-
pends on the competition between exchange and dipolar
interactions, it is worth noting that the two fragments
are independent.

The present results on Nd2Zr2O7 are consistent with
this picture: when the ﬁrst fragment crystallises (the
AIAO ordering forms), the second fragment keeps ﬂuctu-
ating and is not markedly aﬀected. We also note that a
new and original dynamical response forms: for instance,
antiferromagnetic spin waves that could be naively ex-
pected to emerge from the AIAO Bragg peaks are not

INELASTIC NEUTRON SCATTERING

DATA

The main text of the present paper shows maps as a
function of energy transfer and Q along particular direc-
tions of reciprocal space. For the sake of completeness,
Figure S3 shows constant energy cuts covering the full
bandwidth of the spectrum. Above the inelastic line,
a ﬂat mode appears at around Eo = 70 µeV, with a
structure factor characterised by the pinch point pattern.
Above this mode, collective excitations disperse from the
(111) and (002) Q-positions.

The spin ice pattern and the pinch points are more

the cuts taken at small energies, is articially enhanced because of the energy resolution which integrates part of the inelastic
line.

observed.

The strength of the fragmentation scenario is thus to
reveal underlying degrees of freedom, which are not di-
rectly visible in the microscopic Hamiltonian. We can
thus expect that this theory will be relevant to interpret
experimental phenomena, which could not have been ex-
plained otherwise, like here in Nd2Zr2O7, much beyond
the ﬁeld of frustrated magnetism.

VI. MODEL

The model developed in the main text is based on the
following Hamiltonian for rare earth moments (cid:126)Ji at site
i of the pyrochlore lattice:

Wybourne operators (J = 9/2, gJ = 8/11 for the Nd3+
ion) S10. Ji,j is the exchange tensor, Oi is a generic term

to denote the quadrupolar and octopolar operators, and
κi,j is the coupling constant.

The Bnm coeﬃcients have been determined in Ref. S5
and are reproduced in Table SI. The coeﬃcients of the
ground doublet wave functions | ↑,↓(cid:105) are typical of a
dipolar-octopolar doublet S11,S12 with the general form :

| ↑(cid:105) = (a, 0, 0, b, 0, 0, c, 0, 0, d) ,
| ↓(cid:105) = (d, 0, 0,−c, 0, 0, b, 0, 0,−a)

associated with the normalisation condition a2 + b2 +
c2 + d2 = 1. Using this explicit formulation, it is possible
to show that the projection onto the subspace spanned
by | ↑,↓(cid:105) of most dipolar, quadrupolar and octopolar
operators is zero, with in particular:

Jx = 0,
Jy = 0,
JxJy + JyJx = 0,
JxJz + JzJx = 0,
JyJz + JzJy = 0.

The remaining relevant operators are then

vy = 24(−5(b2 + c2) +

√

21(ac + bd)) ≈ 73.5.

This analysis yields a picture of perfect Ising moments
with g⊥ ≡ 0, gz = 2gJ µ = 4.5. Fluctuations between the
two elements of the doublet are, however, induced by vx
and vy. We note that in the present case vy is very large
while vx is zero.

At this point, it is possible either to deal with the
Hamiltonian given by Eq. (d) or to consider a simpli-
ﬁed model projected onto the ground state doublet, pro-
vided the latter is well protected from the excited CEF
states. This issue was solved in Ref. S 12 taking into
account symmetry considerations. The most general bi-
linear Hamiltonian written in terms of the local compo-
nents of a pseudo spin 1/2 degree of freedom σ is of the
“XYZ” form :
H1/2 =

It is similar to the popular Hamiltonian proposed in the
context of quantum spin ice in Ref. S13,S14, except that
it does not contain the bond dependent terms γij and ξij.
With these results in hand, we can make the connection
with the model of Eq. (d):

where κi,j is the coupling constant between octopoles.
The renormalised couplings of the pseudo spin 1/2 are
then:

J yy = 4v2

Starting from a random conﬁguration for the various ob-
servables, the contribution to HMF at site i (in the unit
cell) is diagonalised in the Hilbert space deﬁned by the
{|Jz(cid:105)} , Jz = −J, ..., J basis vectors (2J +1 vectors). This
yields the energies Ei,n and the wave functions |φi,n(cid:105).
The updated expectation values, (cid:104)Ai(cid:105)(cid:48), at each step of
the iteration procedure, are given by:

These are then used to proceed to site j, and this is re-
peated until convergence. This procedure can be applied
for both models given by both Eq. (d) and Eq. (e).
Figure S4(a) shows the mean ﬁeld phase diagram cal-
culated at zero temperature as a function of J (cid:48) and K for
the model of Eq. (e). It contains an antiferromagnetic
“all in - all out” phase (AIAO), a ferromagnetic “2-in 2-
out” ordered spin ice phase (SI); the “O” preﬁx denotes
non magnetic octopolar phases, either with an “all in - all
out” nature, the octopolar moments on one tetrahedron
being of the same sign (O-AIAO), or of the “SI” nature,
2 octopolar moments being positive, the two others being
negative (O-SI).

The equations of the borders between the mean ﬁeld
phases can be obtained analytically based on the ex-
pressions of the diﬀerent molecular ﬁelds:
in the O-
AIAO, AIAO, O-SI and SI, they are given by −6K(cid:104)σy(cid:105),

being positive, the two others being negative. The magnetic moment is zero in the octopolar phases. The green dot shows the
position of the parameters for Nd2Zr2O7 determined by the comparison between the experimental and calculated spin dynamics.

it is possible to ﬁnd the analytical expressions for the
borders between the diﬀerent phases:
i) between the O-AIAO and AIAO : J (cid:48) = K;
ii) between AIAO and O-SI, J (cid:48) = −K/3;
iii) between O-SI and SI, J (cid:48) = K
iv) and ﬁnally between SI and O-AIAO: J (cid:48) = −3K.
The calculated temperature dependence of the octopolar
moment for J (cid:48) = 1.2 K and K = −0.55 K is shown in
Figure S4(b).

VIII. SPIN DYNAMICS IN THE RPA

APPROXIMATION

Spin dynamics are calculated in the random phase ap-
proximation (RPA). The excitations are constructed on
the basis of the transitions between the mean ﬁeld states
|φi,n(cid:105) of energy Ei,n. In this spirit, the mean ﬁeld Hamil-
tonian is written :
HMF =

Vi,n,m,j,n(cid:48),m(cid:48)|φi,n(cid:105)(cid:104)φi,m||φj,n(cid:48)(cid:105)(cid:104)φj,m(cid:48)|,

Following the generalised susceptibility approach S15–18,
the susceptibility reads:

tion (RPA), it is ﬁrst observed that the existence of an in-
elastic signal can be accounted for only if the parameters
are chosen in the octupolar phases (O-AIAO or O-SI).
The physical reason is that in the magnetic phases, the
ordered pseudo spin 1/2 is along the local z ((cid:104)111(cid:105)) axis.
The transverse excitations thus involve spin components
within the planes perpendicular to these axes. As those
components have a Land´e factor equal to zero, they can-
not be observed with neutron scattering. Conversely, if
the ordered component of the pseudo spin 1/2 is along
the local y axis (i.e. of octopolar nature in our case), the
transverse excitations involve spin components along the
local z axis and thus become visible.

Calculations show empirically that the bandwith of the
collective modes deﬁned relatively to Eo is proportional
to J (cid:48). It is also observed that the shift up to Eo of the
(3K)2 − J (cid:48)2, as
pinch point pattern is proportional to
illustrated in Figure S5. The parameters along with their
error bars can de obtained based upon this analysis. The
best agreement is obtained for J (cid:48) = (1.2 ± 0.025) K and
K(cid:48) = (−0.55 ± 0.025) K.
