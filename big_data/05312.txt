We show that the bulk-boundary correspondence for topological insulators can be modiﬁed in
the presence of non-Hermiticity. We consider a one-dimensional tight-binding model with gain and
loss as well as long-range hopping. The system is described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that
encircles an exceptional point in momentum space. The winding number has a fractional value of
1/2. There is only one dynamically stable zero-energy edge state due to the defectiveness of the
Hamiltonian. This edge state is robust to disorder due to protection by a chiral symmetry. We also
discuss experimental realization with arrays of coupled resonator optical waveguides.

Introduction.— The bulk-boundary correspondence is
a central principle that governs the band structure of
tight-binding models [1, 2].
It says that the bulk of a
lattice is characterized by a topological invariant, whose
value determines the existence of gapless states that are
localized on the edges of the sample. The bulk-boundary
correspondence applies universally to all noninteracting
tight-binding models, which are usually assumed to be
Hermitian, i.e., closed systems. As such, it has been used
to predict edge states in a variety of settings, including
solid state [3, 4], cold atoms [5, 6], photonics [7–9], and
even acoustics [10, 11].

In a one-dimensional tight-binding model, the topolog-
ical invariant is the winding number, which is always an
integer [1, 2]. If the winding number is 0, there are no
edge states. If the winding number is ±1, there will be a
pair of zero-energy edge states (one on the left and one
on the right). As the Hamiltonian is modiﬁed, the edge
states are “topologically protected” because the winding
number changes only when the gap closes.

The bulk-boundary correspondence was developed for
Hermitian systems, as motivated by solid state experi-
ments. However, experiments with photonics are intrinsi-
cally non-Hermitian due to gain and loss, which raises the
question of whether they can display physics beyond the
bulk-boundary correspondence. The general conclusion
so far is that the usual bulk-boundary correspondence
still holds in the presence of non-Hermiticity, although
the spectrum may be complex [12–19].

In this Letter, we show that the bulk-boundary corre-
spondence is modiﬁed in the presence of non-Hermiticity.
We consider a one-dimensional tight-binding model with
gain and loss, motivated by recent experiments with op-
tical waveguides [7–9, 20–23]. First, we show that the
winding number can have a fractional value of 1/2, be-
cause the Brillouin zone is 4π periodic when circling an
exceptional point (a non-Hermitian degeneracy) [24]. An
open chain exhibits a zero-energy eigenvalue, which is
peculiar because it is defective [25]. Although there are
two edge states, only one of them is dynamically stable.
This edge state is protected by a chiral symmetry and
is robust to disorder until the band gap closes. These
new features are due to the fact that a non-Hermitian

matrix can be defective, while a Hermitian matrix is al-
ways diagonalizable [25]. We also discuss experimental
implementation with optical resonators and waveguides.
Model.— To motivate our model, we ﬁrst consider a
simple 2 × 2 non-Hermitian Hamiltonian,

Hk = hxσx +

σz.

(1)

where σx, σz are Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues are de-
generate when (hx, hz) = (±γ/2, 0). Such non-Hermitian
degeneracies are called exceptional points [24]. We vary
the parameters hx, hz so as to encircle an exceptional
point [26]:

hx = v + r cos k,

hz = r sin k,

(2)

where k is an external parameter for now. As k in-
creases, we make a circular trajectory in hx, hz space
[Fig. 1(a)]. When v − r < ±γ/2 < v + r, Hk encircles
the exceptional point at (±γ/2, 0). Without loss of gen-
erality, we assume that r is positive, while v can take any
sign.

Now, we ﬁnd the

tight-binding model whose
momentum-space Hamiltonian is Hk. The tight-binding
model is given by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian H. As
shown in Fig. 1(b), H is a one-dimensional lattice with
long-range hopping as well as gain and loss. To imple-
ment H, the physical system we have in mind is a classi-
cal system of optical resonators with complex amplitudes

so there are a total of 2N sites. Equation (3) is mathe-
matically equivalent to evolving a Schr¨odinger equation
with H [9, 20–23]. γ is the non-Hermitian gain and loss
on the α and β sublattices, respectively. v, r denote the
Hermitian hopping between sites.

Equation (3) is valid when the light ﬁelds are weak,
such that the dynamics are linear. For strong light ﬁelds,
the gain medium saturates, and the dynamics become
nonlinear [27]. We are interested in the linear regime,
when the system is equivalent to a tight-binding model.
Note that an experiment would also have noise [not
shown in Eq. (3)].

H is similar to Hofstader’s model of a particle moving
on a discrete lattice in a magnetic ﬁeld, since the particle
accumulates a phase of π when it goes around a plaquette
[28]. Later on, we discuss how to implement Eq. (3)
experimentally in an array of coupled resonator optical
waveguides [29].

H has two important symmetries. The ﬁrst is chiral
n σy,n, ΓHΓ = −H. So if H
symmetry:
has an eigenvector un with eigenvalue En, then Γun is
also an eigenvector with eigenvalue −En. There is also
parity-time (PT ) symmetry:
n σx,n and
T iT −1 = −i, PT HT −1P−1 = H. This means that the
eigenvalues of H can be real, despite the non-Hermiticity
[30].

Periodic boundary conditions.— For a periodic chain,
the Hamiltonian H is diagonalized in momentum space

letting Γ = (cid:76)

as Hk, given in Eqs. (1)–(2), where k ∈ [0, 2π). The
eigenvalues of Hk are

(cid:18) sin θ/2
(cid:19)

The real part of Ek is gapped when ||v| − r| > γ/2. The
imaginary part is gapped when ||v| + r| < γ/2. Figure 2
shows an example spectrum. The eigenvectors of Hk are

(5)

where tan θ = −(v + r cos k)/(r sin k + iγ/2).

The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Hk are 4π periodic
in k when Hk encircles one exceptional point [24, 31].
This is a well-known feature of non-Hermitian systems
and is due to the square root in Eq. (4) and the half angles
in Eq. (5). After circling once around an exceptional
point, the two eigenvectors exchange values; to come back
to the initial value, one must circle twice.
Now, we calculate the winding number of the eigen-
vectors. We follow the trajectory of (cid:104)σx(cid:105),(cid:104)σz(cid:105) for an
eigenvector as k sweeps through the Brillouin zone and
see whether it winds around the origin [12]. As seen in
Fig. 2(c), the winding number depends on whether Hk
encircles an exceptional point. When Hk does not encir-
cle an exceptional point, the winding number is 0. When
Hk encircles one exceptional point, the eigenvector does
wind around the origin, but k must sweep through 4π
in order to close the trajectory; thus, the winding num-
ber has a fractional value of 1/2 [32]. When Hk encircles
both exceptional points, the winding number is 1. (These
results can be proven analytically.)

To experimentally observe the fractional winding num-
ber, one can modulate the hopping amplitudes in time to
adiabatically sweep through the Brillouin zone (see Sup-
plemental Material for details). An alternative approach
may be to use Bloch oscillations [33].

Since a periodic chain has nontrivial topology, we next
investigate whether there are zero-energy edge states in a
chain with open boundaries. However, there is a problem:
Eq. (4) says that when one exceptional point is encircled,
Ek is gapless in both real and imaginary parts. This
is worrisome because it precludes the existence of zero-
energy edge states, which usually require a band gap.

Open boundary conditions.— Figure 3 shows the spec-
trum for an open chain. There are several remarkable
features of this spectrum:

• A gap opens up in the spectrum’s real part in the
vicinity of v = γ/2, dividing most of the eigenvalues
into two distinct bands [Fig. 3(a)].

• Within the band gap, there is an E = 0 eigenvalue,
which is twofold degenerate but defective [25]. This
eigenvalue is associated with an eigenvector and a
generalized eigenvector. Under time evolution, the
eigenvector dominates over the generalized eigen-
vector, so the latter is unimportant to the long-time
dynamics.

• The eigenvector for E = 0 is localized either on
the left edge (when v > 0) or the right edge (when
v < 0) [see Fig. 3(c)]. The edge state is protected
by chiral symmetry, and it appears when the gap
opens and disappears when the gap closes.

• For |v| ≥ γ/2,

the spectrum is purely real
[Fig. 3(b)], i.e., PT symmetry is preserved, in con-
trast to a periodic chain [30].

Open chain: case of v = γ/2.— We discuss, in detail,
the case of v = γ/2, where H can be solved exactly. We
seek the eigenvalues of H, as well as their algebraic and
geometric multiplicities [25]. It is more convenient to deal
with H 2, which is block upper triangular. It is easy to
show that the characteristic polynomial of H 2 is f (λ) =

λ2(λ − r2)2N−2, which implies that H has eigenvalues
E = 0, r,−r with algebraic multiplicities 2, N − 1, N −
1, respectively. The Jordan normal form indicates that
the geometric multiplicities of all three eigenvalues are 1.
Thus, H is highly defective at v = γ/2. Note that the
eigenvalues are real.

The eigenvector for E = 0 is the edge state

u0 = (i, 1, 0, 0, . . .)T ,

(6)

in the basis α1, β1, α2, β2, . . .. So u0 is localized on the
left-most unit cell. It is its own chiral partner: Γu0 =
−u0. Physically, this state has zero energy because of
destructive interference between the hopping and non-
Hermiticity.

The generalized eigenvector u(cid:48)
0 = u0 [25]:

For v = −γ/2, H can be similarly solved: u0 and u(cid:48)
Open chain: case of v (cid:54)= γ/2.— As v deviates from
γ/2, the bands are no longer degenerate, and the band
gap narrows and eventually closes. There is still a de-
fective E = 0 eigenvalue because it is protected by chi-
ral symmetry [Fig. 3(c)]. However, when the band gap
closes, the E = 0 eigenvalue splits into two distinct eigen-
values that join the upper and lower bands [Fig. 3(a)].

0

Strictly speaking, for ﬁnite N , the E = 0 eigenvalue
is defective only when v = γ/2. However, we ﬁnd nu-
merically that for a range of v around γ/2, H has one
vanishingly small singular value [25], which decreases as
N increases (see Supplemental Material). This indicates

for a range of v.

In the Supplemental Material, we show that the E =
0 eigenvalue is robust to disorder due to protection by
chiral symmetry. The eigenvalue remains at E = 0 until
the disorder is strong enough to close the band gap.

Discussion.— The general time-dependent solution to
Eq. (3) involves the eigenvectors and generalized eigen-
vector of H. Consider the regime when the E = 0 eigen-
value exists and is defective. In this case, the coeﬃcient
of u0 increases linearly in time, while the coeﬃcient of u(cid:48)
0
is independent of time [34]. Thus, as time increases, the
population in the E = 0 subspace is dominated by u0.

In a typical topological insulator, there are a pair of
E = 0 eigenvectors (one on the left and one on the right),
and they are equally important to the dynamics [2]. In
our non-Hermitian model, due to the defectiveness of the
E = 0 eigenvalue, it has one eigenvector and one gen-
eralized eigenvector (both on the same edge). However,
only the eigenvector is present in the long-time-scale dy-
namics. Thus, the generalized eigenvector is dynamically
unstable, and there is only one dynamically stable edge
state. We note that in the Hermitian limit (γ = 0), our
model behaves entirely like a typical topological insula-
tor.

Our non-Hermitian model is highly sensitive to bound-
ary conditions. A periodic chain has a complex spectrum
and a nonzero winding number, while an open chain can
have a real spectrum but has no winding number. An
open chain also has a band gap not present in a periodic
chain. These diﬀerences are because an open chain is
much more defective than a periodic chain.

We note that the Su-Schrieﬀer-Heeger model also has a
single zero-energy state when the number of sites is odd
[35]. Because of the incompleteness of a unit cell, this
state exists even when the gap closes. This state is not de-
fective because the algebraic and geometric multiplicities
are both 1. In contrast, our model’s zero-energy state is
defective and disappears when the gap closes. Our zero-
energy state originates from the non-Hermiticity instead
of the peculiarity of an incomplete unit cell.

Experimental implementation.— Equation (3) can be
implemented with an array of coupled resonator optical
waveguides similar to Ref. [29]. In this setup, each site
is a resonator, and waveguides between resonators allow
photons to hop between sites. One would design an array
of resonators with waveguide connections as in Fig. 1(b).
The phase of a hopping amplitude can be tuned by mak-
ing the corresponding waveguide asymmetric; in this way,
one can engineer the imaginary hopping amplitudes in H.
To avoid cross talk between the diagonal waveguides that
cross each other, one diagonal should be below the other.
In principle, the gain on the α sublattice can be ob-
tained by incorporating a pumped gain medium as in
Ref. [21]. In practice, it is easier to let both sublattices
be lossy but with more loss on the β sublattice [9, 20];

excitation on α1, (a,b) when zero-energy state is present
(v = 0.5γ, r = 0.5γ) and (c,d) when it is absent (v = 1.5γ, r =
0.5γ). (a,c) Population on each unit cell over time, plotted
using color scale. (b,d) Fourier spectrum of α1.

such a passive setup avoids the complication of the gain
medium. The physics is still described by Eq. (3) but on
top of a background of decay.
When |v| ≥ γ/2, H has real eigenvalues, so the evolu-
tion is oscillatory (Fig. 4). It is easy to detect the E = 0
state by exciting the left edge and measuring the fre-
quency spectrum of the subsequent evolution. When the
E = 0 state is present, the spectrum has a peak at zero
frequency [Fig. 4(b)]. When the E = 0 state is absent,
there is no peak at zero frequency [Fig. 4(d)].

Conclusion.— We have shown that non-Hermiticity
breaks the usual bulk-boundary scenario. The new fea-
tures are due to the fact that a non-Hermitian matrix
can be defective, while a Hermitian matrix is always di-
agonalizable.
In the future, it would be interesting to
consider transport properties in the presence of a poten-
tial gradient [33] or scattering properties, especially when
the Brillouin zone is 4π periodic. One should also extend
the model to two dimensions to see whether the Chern
number can be fractional and whether there is still only
one dynamically stable edge state.

Robustness to disorder

6

We now show that the zero-energy edge state is robust
to disorder that preserves chiral symmetry. The E = 0
eigenvalue remains in the spectrum until the disorder is
large enough that the band gap closes. We allow r, v, γ
to be diﬀerent for each unit cell:

H still has chiral symmetry: ΓHΓ = −H where Γ =
n σy,n. We note that the rn in the ﬁrst line of Eq. (8)
can be diﬀerent from the rn in the second line and still
preserve chiral symmetry.

Figure 5(a,b) shows an example spectrum with disor-
der in r: rn = r + d n, where n is a uniform random
variable on [−1, 1], and d is the disorder strength. The
E = 0 eigenvalue is completely robust to disorder in this
case, even when the band gap closes; its eigenvector re-
mains localized on the left-most unit cell. The bands are
aﬀected by disorder, although all eigenvalues stay real.

Figure 5(c,d) shows an example spectrum with disor-
der in v: vn = v + d n. The E = 0 eigenvalue is ro-
bust to disorder until the real gap narrows at d ≈ 0.5,
at which point it splits into two imaginary eigenvalues.
Those eigenvalues undergo exceptional points with other
eigenvalues at d ≈ 1.

Figure 5(e,f) shows an example spectrum with disorder
in γ: γn = γ + d n. The E = 0 eigenvalue is robust to
disorder until the real gap closes at d ≈ 0.4, at which
point the eigenvalue has an exceptional point with other
eigenvalues.

Thus, the E = 0 eigenvalue is robust to disorder as
long as chiral symmetry is preserved and the gap does not
close. (If the disorder did not preserve chiral symmetry,
the eigenvalue would immediately deviate from E = 0 for
small d.)

Experimental detection of fractional winding

The most direct way to see the 4π periodicity of the
eigenvectors is to modulate the hopping amplitudes in
time. We multiply the hopping amplitudes by a phase

This phase modulation can be implemented in an optical
experiment like Ref. [29] by adding a Kerr medium to one

the Brillouin zone. By changing φ adiabatically, one can
directly observe the 4π periodicity of the eigenvectors.
Equations (10) and (11) have been studied in Refs. [26,
31].
For example, suppose the system is initialized in the
uk,− eigenstate with k = 0. Suppose also that v − r <
γ/2 < v + r, so one exceptional point is encircled. Start-
ing from φ = 0, we increase φ in time. When φ = 2π,
the system does not return to the original eigenstate, but
it will be in uk,+. In contrast, if the exceptional point
is not encircled, then the system will return to the orig-
inal eigenstate. In this way, one can clearly see the 4π
periodicity due to the exceptional point.

We note that the switching of the eigenvectors can de-
pend on whether the trajectory around the exceptional
point is clockwise or counter-clockwise [26, 31].

Range of defectiveness

Here, we provide numerical evidence that Eq. (3) of the
main text has a defective E = 0 eigenvalue for a range of
v. Figure 6 shows the smallest and second smallest sin-
gular values of H. For a range of v around ±γ/2, there
is one vanishingly small singular value, and it decreases
as N increases. Thus, for large N , the geometric mul-
tiplicity of the E = 0 eigenvalue is 1 for a range of v.
Since its algebraic multiplicity is 2, the E = 0 eigenvalue
is defective in this range.

of refraction using an external source of light.
In this
way, the phase of a hopping amplitude can be changed
in situ.
