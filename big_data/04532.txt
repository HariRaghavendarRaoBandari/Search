Abstract. We show that the skew-growth function of a dual Artin monoid of
ﬁnite type P has exactly rank(P ) =: l simple real zeros on the interval (0, 1].
The proofs for types Al and Bl are based on an unexpected fact that the skew-
growth functions, up to a trivial factor, are expressed by Jacobi polynomials
due to a Rodrigues type formula in the theory of orthogonal polynomials. The
skew-growth functions for type Dl also satisfy Rodrigues type formulae, but
the relation with Jacobi polynomials is not straightforward, and the proof is
intricate. We show that the smallest root converges to zero as the rank l of all
the above types tend to inﬁnity.

1. Introduction

We study the zero loci of the skew-growth function ([Sa2])1 of a dual Artin monoid
of ﬁnite type ([Be])2. The skew-growth function is identiﬁed with the generating
function of M¨obius invariants (called the characteristic polynomial) of the lattice
of non-crossing partitions ([K, Be, B-W]), and is further shown by several authors
([At, A-T, B-W, Ch]) to be equal to the generating function of dimensions of cones
of the positive part of the cluster fan of Fomin-Zelevinsky ([F-Z1]). We observe
that this combinatorially deﬁned function shows an unexpected strong connection
with orthogonal polynomials. With the help of them, our goal is to show that the
roots of the skew-growth function are simple and lying in the interval (0, 1], and
that the smallest root converges to zero as the rank of the type tends to inﬁnity.

Let us explain the contents. Recall ([B-S]) that an Artin group GM (resp. an
Artin monoid G+
M ) associated with a Coxeter matrix M = (mij )i,j∈I is a group
(resp. monoid) generated by letters i (i ∈ I) and deﬁned by the Artin braid relations:

(1.1)

aiajai · · · = ajaiaj · · ·

(i, j ∈ I)

M → GM is shown to be injective (in particular, G+

where both sides are words of alternating sequences of letters ai and aj of the same
length mij = mji ∈ Z>0 with the initial letters ai and aj, respectively. The natural
morphism G+
M is cancellative)
so that the Artin monoid is regarded as a submonoid of the Artin group. Requiring
more relations aiai = 1 (i ∈ I), we obtain the Coxeter group GM and the quotient
morphism: π : GM → GM (for short, we shall denote π(g) by g for g ∈ GM ).
We call S := {ai | i ∈ I} the simple generator system of the Artin group and
the Artin monoid, and S := {ai | i ∈ I} that of the Coxeter group. The number

1The study of the skew-growth function of a monoid and its zero loci is motivated by the study
of the partition functions associated with the monoid, since the partition functions are given by
certain residue formula at the zero loci of the skew-growth function ([Sa3] §11 Th.6 and §12).

2Dual Artin monoids were introduced by D. Bessis ([Be], c.f. [B-K-L]) under the name dual

braid monoids. For more detailed explanations, see the following part of §1 and Appendix III.

with respect to the word length, we deﬁne the degree homomorphism:

In the present note, we study only the cases when the Coxeter group is of ﬁnite

by GP and also by GP (resp. G+

Actually, the projection π induces a bijection from T to the set T of all reﬂections
(i.e. elements which are conjugate to elements in S) in the Coxeter group GP . It
was shown that the generator system T satisfy quadratic relations

for non-crossing pairs r, s ∈ T and s∗ ∈ T with the relation ¯r · ¯s = ¯s∗ · ¯r (see

Al (l ∈ Z≥1) when the Artin group GAl is a braid group B(l + 1), we modify the
terminology in the present note, and call the monoid Gdual+
a dual Artin monoid
of type P , and regard it as a submonoid of the Artin group GP . By deﬁnition (1.3),
we have deg(t) = 1 for all t ∈ T, and hence the restriction of the degree morphism

For any cancellative monoid M with a degree homomorphism deg : M → R≥0
satisfying an ascending chain condition, we introduced in [Sa2] the concept of a
skew-growth function NM,deg(t) in the Novikov ring Z[[trange(deg)]] (recall Footnote
1 for its motivation). In particular, if the monoid M is a lattice (i.e. M admits a
left or right least common multiple for any ﬁnite subsets of M ), the skew-growth
function is given by a simple formula:

(1.6)

NM,deg(t) = X

J ⊂I

(−1)#J tdeg(lcml(J))

where the index J runs over all ﬁnite subsets of I := M \ {1, M · M } (=the set
of minimal generators of M ). It is easy to see (1 − t) | NM,deg(t), and we set the

reduced skew-growth function: bNM,deg(t) := NM,deg(t)/(1 − t).

Actually, the poset structures on Artin monoids and dual Artin monoids w.r.t.
left (or right) division relations, are known ([B-S], [Be]) to be lattices so that the
formula (1.6) is valid, where the minimal generator system I is S or T, respectively.
Furthermore, these monoids are constructed from a certain ﬁnite pre-monoid [1, ∆]S

and [1, c]T in the Coxeter group (Bessis [Be], see Footnote 3 and Appendix III),
where the poset structure on [1, c]T is called the lattice of non-crossing partitions of
type P ([Be], [B-W]). Then, we observe that the characteristic polynomial (i.e. the
generating function of the M¨obius function of the ﬁnite lattices [1, ∆]S and [1, c]T
([St] (3.39)) coincides with the skew-growth function (1.6) for Artin and dual Artin
monoids, respectively ([C-F, Sa2], see Appendix III, Fact 9.3).

P

Explicit expressions of the skew-growth function for the Artin monoid G+

P are
given by calculating the word length of fundamental elements for all sub-diagrams
of Dynkin diagrams of type P ([A-N],[Sa1]). To obtain an explicit description of the
skew-growth function for the dual Artin monoid Gdual+
, we need more considera-
tions: Chapoton ([Ch]) conjectured a transformation formula from the generating
function of two variables of M¨obius invariants of pairs of elements of the lattice
[1, cP ]T to the two variable generating function of cone-counting of the cluster fan
∆(P ) (Fomin-Zelevinsky [F-Z1]). In particular, the specialization of the Chapoton
formula to one variable is the identity between the generating function of M¨obius
numbers of the lattice [1, cP ]T with the generating function of the cones of the posi-
tive part ∆+(P ) of the fan, and was already shown by Chapoton ([ibid]) (the general
formula was proven by Athanasiadis, Brady and Watt [B-W] [A-B-W] depending
on each of the cases separately, and a case free proof is given by Athanasiadis [At]).
Thus, the kth coeﬃcient of the skew-growth function NGdual+
,deg(t), up to sign, is
equal to the number of k-dimensional cones of the cluster fan ∆+(P ) of type P . In
Tables A and B of Appendix I, we list explicit formulae of skew-growth functions
of dual Artin monoids of ﬁnite type.

Remark 1.2. Conjecture 1. is approved for types Al (1 ≤ l ≤ 30), Bl (2 ≤ l ≤ 30),
Dl (4 ≤ l ≤ 30), E6, E7, E8, F4, G2, H3, H4 and I2(p) (p ≥ 3) by using the
software package Mathematica on the Table A and B in Appendix I.

The goal of the present note is to give aﬃrmative answers to Conjectures 2 and
3. The proof is based on the explicit expressions of the skew-growth functions in
Appendix I, and is divided into three groups:
i) two inﬁnite series of types Al
and Bl, ii) the inﬁnite series of type Dl, and iii) the remaining exceptional types
E6, E7, E8, F4, G2 and non-crystallographic types H3, H4 and I2(p).

Let us give a review of the proof. The third group iii) consists only of types of
bounded ranks so that Conjecture 3 does have no meaning, and the Conjecture 1
and 2 are veriﬁed by direct calculations for each type. Therefore, our main task is
to manage the inﬁnite series with the growing rank l in groups i) and ii).

The key fact to do this is a rather mysterious expression for the skew-growth
functions, which we shall call Rodrigues type formula in analogy with the Rodrigues
formula in orthogonal polynomial theory ([Sz]). Namely, in §2, we show that the
skew-growth functions of rank l is expressed (up to a simple constant factor or linear

combinations) by a polynomial of the form (cid:0) d

dt(cid:1)l+ε1(cid:2)tl+ε2 (1 − t)l+ε3(cid:3) where εi are

some small and ﬁxed “ﬂuctuation” numbers. Its proof is elementary, however the
meaning of the expression, in particular, of the ﬂuctuation numbers, is still unclear.
Then, we show further in §3 that the Rodrigues type formulae lead to recursion
relations of the series of the skew-growth functions. Namely, we obtain 3-term
recursion relations for the series of types Al and Bl, respectively, and 4-term recur-
rence relations for the series of type Dl. In case of types Al and Bl, we may reduce
the proof of recurrence to that of corresponding Jacobi polynomials, but we don’t
know whether such type of reduction is possible for type Dl or not.

Proofs of Conjecture 2 for types Al and Bl are given in §4. A direct proof is
that Jacobi polynomial expressions of the skew-growth functions for the types in §2
imply automatically that Conjecture 2 is true. An alternative approach is that the
recurrence relations in §3 show easily that the series of the skew-growth functions
form a Sturm sequence in the sense of [T] Theorem 4.3. Proof of Conjecture 2
for type Dl is more complicated and is given in §5, where we essentially use the
Rodrigues type formula in §2 but no explicit use of Jacobi polynomials. We do not
know whether there is a proof to reduce the conjecture to Jacobi polynomials.

In §6, we prove Conjecture 3 aﬃrmatively, where the relationship of the skew-
growth functions with Jacobi polynomials given in §2 plays the key role. For series
of types Al and Bl, we have two proofs again. A direct proof is based on the general
fact that the zeros of a series of Jacobi polynomials is dense in the interval (0,1),
implying Conjecture 3. Another alternative proof is based on a sharp approximation

of the distribution of all roots (the “density” is proportional to 1/pt(1 − t)) of the

skew-growth function of type Al and Bl and is given by sandwiching the roots by the
roots of Legendrian polynomials. The proof for the series Dl uses again Rodrigues
type formula in §2, where the functions of type Dl are expressed by those of type
Bl so that the roots of type Dl are sandwiched by the roots of type Bl.

Appendix I gives Tables A and B of skew-growth-functions of dual Artin monoids
of ﬁnite type. Appendix II exhibits ﬁgures of the zeros of the skew-growth functions
for dual Artin monoids of type 20, B20, D20 and E8. In Appendix III, we recall
Bessis’s study of dual Artin monoids, and then identify the skew-growth function
of them with the characteristic polynomial of the non-crossing partition lattice.

FOR DUAL ARTIN MONOIDS.

Remark 1.3. Finally, let us give a rather vague philosophical remark on the present
study. Recall that our starting point was the skew-growth function of a dual Artin
monoid. That is, the starting function is given combinatorially by the enumeration
of the dimensions of cones of a cluster fan. Then, it turns out to be (unexpectedly)
expressed by certain analytic objects such as Jacobi orthogonal polynomials. This
picture resembles mirror symmetry: some enumeration of BPS states are mirror to
some Hodge structure or to period integral theory. Both have the pattern that an
enumeration of some combinatorial objects is transformed to a function of analytic
nature. However, we have no further explanations of this analogy.

2. Rodrigues type formulae and orthogonal polynomials

In this section, for the three inﬁnite series l, Bl and Dl of skew-growth functions,

we show two facts: Rodrigues type formulae (Theorem 2.1).

Theorem 2.1. (Rodrigues type formula) For types l (l ≥ 1), Bl (l ≥ 2) and
Dl (l ≥ 4), we have the formulae:

As an application of the Rodrigues type formulae, we show that the the series of
skew-growth functions for types Al (l ≥ 1), Bl (l ≥ 2) and Dl satisfy either 3-term
or 4-term recurrence relations (Theorem 3.1).

In the present section, we prove, except for types Dl, following Theorem, which

approves Conjecture 2. The proof for types Dl is given in the next section 5.

Proof. Case I: type Al (l ∈ Z≥1) and Bl (l ∈ Z≥1).

This is an immediate consequence of the formulae (2.5) and (2.6), since the

Jacobi polynomials eP (1,1)

Then, we apply the Euclid division algorithm for the pair of polynomials f0 :=

polynomials in t such that fk−1 = fk · qk−1 + fk+1 for k = 1, 2, · · · (where qk−1 is
the quotient and fk+1 is the remainder).

Then, we prove the following fact by direct calculations case by case.

Fact 4.2. i) The degrees of the sequence f0, f1, f2, · · · of polynomials descend one
by one, and fl−1 is a non-zero constant.

ii) The sequence f0(0), f1(0), −f2(0), . . . , −fl−1(0) has constant sign and the se-

quence f0(1), f1(1), −f2(1), . . . , −fl−1(1) has alternating sign.

Applying the Sturm Theorem (see for instance [T] Theorem 3.3), we observe that

f0 has l − 1 distinct roots on the interval (0, 1). Since the polynomial f0 = bNGdual+

is of degree l − 1, all the roots should be simple.

This completes a proof of Theorem 4.1.

ZERO LOCI OF SKEW-GROWTH FUNCTIONS

FOR DUAL ARTIN MONOIDS.

Proof. Recall the Rodrigues type formula (2.3) for type Dl for l ∈ Z≥4. Up to the
factor (1 − t), we consider the factor in the derivatives:

Hl(t)

:= (t2 − t)l−3n(l − 2) − (3l − 4)t + (3l − 4)t2o

so that the following equality holds.

(5.1)

NDl (t) = (−1)l−3

dt(cid:1)l−3(cid:0)(1 − t)Hl(t)(cid:1)

Set H (i)

(t) := di

l

dti Hl(t) for 0 ≤ i ≤ l − 3. Applying i-times the Rolle theorem
to the polynomial Hl(t), we know that H (i)
(t) has at least i number of distinct
(possibly multiple) roots on the interval (0, 1) and that if the number of roots is
exactly equal to i then the function H (i)

(t) changes its sign at the zeros.

(1/2 + t) = (−1)iH (i)

(1/2 − t). Therefore, the set of roots of H (i)

Proof of Lemma 5.2. Since Hl(t) is invariant by the reﬂection t 7→ 1 − t, we
have H (i)
are
symmetric with respect to the reﬂection centered at t = 1/2.
In particular, for
0 < 2L ≤ l − 3, if H (2L)
(1/2) is non zero, then the half of real roots are lying on
the half line (1/2, ∞). If the number of roots on the interval (1/2, 1) were equal
to L (hence 2L roots on (0, 1)), as we saw above by Rolle’s theorem, the sign of
H (2L)
(1/2) should be (−1)l+L−3. However, the following Formula A shows that
it is not the case for some L. That is, H (2L)
(t) has more than L roots on the
interval (1/2, 1). Since deg(H (2L)
) = 2l − 2L − 4 and the multiplicity of the zeros at
t = 0, 1 is l − 3 − 2L, we conclude that the number of roots on the interval (1/2,1)
is bounded by, and, hence is equal to L + 1, and that all roots are simple. Then,
for 2L ≤ i ≤ l − 3, applying i − 2L times Rolle’s theorem to H (2L)
, we see that the
polynomial H (i)
has i + 2 simple roots on the interval (0, 1). Therefore, it remains
only to show the following formula.

6. Proof of Conjecture 3

In this section, we prove the following theorem, which approve Conjecture 3.

Theorem 6.1. For each series of types Pl = Al, Bl, Dl, the smallest zero locus of
NGdual+

(t) monotone decreasingly converge to 0 as the rank l tends to inﬁnity.

Pl

Proof. Let us ﬁx notation: for type Pl = Al, Bl, Dl, let tPl,ν, ν = 1, 2, . . . , l, be the
zeros of NGdual+

(t) in decreasing order (i.e. 1 = tPl,1 > tPl,2 > · · · > tPl,l > 0).

Pl

I. Case for types Al and Bl.

In view of Jacobi polynomial expressions (2.5) and (2.6), up to the ﬁrst root
l−1 and

tPl,1 = 1, the zeros tl,ν and tBl,ν (ν = 2, · · · , l) are equal to the zeros of ˜P (1,1)
˜P (1,0)
l−1 , respectively. Then, the following fact is known (see [Sz] Theorem 3.3.2.).

Fact 6.2. The system {tPl,ν}l

ν=2 alternates with the system {tPl+1,ν}l+1

ν=2, that is,

tPl+1,ν > tPl,ν > tPl+1,ν+1,

(ν = 2, . . . , l).

In particular, this implies that both sequences {tl,l}∞

l=2 are de-
creasing monotonously. On the other hand, recall a fact (see [Sz] Theorem 6.1.2).

l=1 and {tBl,l}∞

Fact 6.3. Let I be sub-interval of [0, 1] of positive measure. Then, if l is suﬃciently
large, there exists at least one 1 < ν ≤ l such that tPl,ν ∈ I.

Applying this Fact to intervals I = [0, ε] for small ε > 0, we complete the proof

of Theorem 6.1. for types Al and Bl. ✷

Let us give an alternative proof of Theorem 6.1 for types Al and Bl by describing
a distributions of all roots. Namely, we show that the density of roots is proportional

to dt/pt(1 − t) (whose precise meaning is given in Fact 6.5) by sandwiching the
roots of types Al and Bl by the roots of shifted Legendre polynomial ePl(t) :=
P (0,0)
l

(2t − 1) (the shifting of Legendre polynomial P (0,0)

(t)).

on shifted Legendre polynomial (c.f. [Sz] 4.5.1, see also §2), we obtain an explicit
expression of the shifted Legendre polynomial for l ∈ Z≥0.

By comparing this expression with the expressions in Table A of Appendix I, we

Proposition 6.6. For type Pl = Al, Bl, the inequalities hold as follows:

1 = tPl,1 > ˜x1 > tPl,2 > · · · > ˜xl−1 > tPl,l > ˜xl > 0.

Proof. We consider 2l − 1 open intervals (t′

This coincides with the coeﬃcient of (−t)k on the left hand side in Table A. (cid:3)

Remark that Fact 5.2. implies the inequlity tBl,l < tBl−1,l−1 ≤ tB2,2 = 1/3 for all
l ≥ 3. Therefore, the second coeﬃcient l+1
2l−1 − t of the formula (6.4) takes positive
values on the interval [0, tBl−1,l−1]. Thanks to (6.4), we have that on the interval
[0, tBl,l] the value NGdual+
(tBl,l) > 0.
On the other hand, since tBl,l < tBl−1,l−1 < tBl,l−1 (recall Fact 6.2), we have
NGdual+
(tBl−1,l−1) < 0. Then, due to intermediate value

9. Appendix III

In the present Appendix, we ﬁrst recall David Bessis’s description [Be] of a dual
Artin monoid Gdual+
and its relationship with the non-crossing partition. Then, we
identify the skew-growth function of the dual Artin monoid with the characteristic
polynomial of the lattice of non-crossing partitions of type P . We use the notation
of §1 freely.

P

Let (GP , S) be a Coxeter system of ﬁnite type P and let T ⊂ GP the set of all
reﬂections as in §1. For an element g ∈ GP , the length lT (g) ∈ Z≥0 is deﬁned as
the minimal length of words expressing g by T . Clearly the length function lT is
subadditive. For g, h ∈ GP , we say g divides h from the left (with respect to T ),
and denote g|l
T h or g ≤T h, if lT (g) + lT (g−1h) = lT (h). Similarly, we say g divides
h from the right and denote g|r
T h or h ≥T g, if lT (g) + lT (hg−1) = lT (h). Since
T , and hence lT , is invariant by conjugation, one has g ≤T g′ ⇔ g′ ≥T g for any
g, g′ ∈ GP . So, we deﬁne for any h ∈ GP the interval

T h} = {g ∈ GP | g|r

T h}.

[1, h]T := {g ∈ GP | g|l

(9.1)
On the interval, a pre-monoid structure3 is deﬁned: namely, for a pair (g, g′) ∈
[1, h]T × [1, h]T a product g · g′ := gg′ is deﬁned in the pre-monoid only when
gg′ ∈ [1, h]T and lT (gg′) = lT (g) + lT (g′). Let M : CpreMonid → CMonid be the left
adjoint functor of the natural embedding CMonoid → CpreMonoid of the category of
monoids to the category of pre-monoids.4 The monoid M ([1, h]T ) is cancellative in
the sense that for m ∈ M ([1, h]T ) and g, g′ ∈ [1, h]T if g · m = g′ · m or m · g = m · g′

3A set A will be called a pre-monoid if the product is deﬁned from a subset of A × A to A
which satisﬁes: i) unitarity: ∃1 ∈ A such that for any g ∈ A, 1g and g1 are deﬁned as g, and ii)
associativity: products gg′ and (gg′)g” are deﬁned if and only if products g′g” and g(g′g”) are
deﬁned and (gg′)g” = g(g′g”) for any g, g′, g” ∈ A (see [Be]).

4Let A be a pre-monoid. Then, M (A) is explicitly given by the monoid generated by elements
of A and deﬁned by the relations g · g′ = gg′ for all g, g′ ∈ A whenever their product is deﬁned
in the pre-monoid A (here we denote by g · g′ also the product of g, g′ in the monoid M (A)).

holds in M ([1, h]T ), then g = g′ holds in [1, h]T (Proof. The assumption implies
¯g ¯m = ¯g′ ¯m or ¯m¯g = ¯m¯g′ holds in GP (here, we denote by ¯m, ¯g and ¯g′ the images in
GP of m, g and g′, respectively), and, therefore g = g′ holds in GP and hence in
[1, h]T . Here, the natural composition: [1, h]T → M ([1, h]T ) → GP is injective).

Since the Coxeter diagram associated with the simple generator system S is a

tree, we have a bipartite decomposition S = L` R (unique up to a transposition
form c = cLcR where cL := Qa∈L a and cR := Qa∈R a. The projection ¯c of c in the

of L and R) such that elements in L (resp. R) are mutually commutative. Then
a Coxeter element c in the Artin monoid G+
P is deﬁned to be the product of the

Coxeter group GP is the Coxeter element in the classical sense. Clearly ¯c is divisible
(in the sense of |T ) by all elements of T so that T ⊂ [1, ¯c]T . We call two reﬂections
r, s ∈ T a non-crossing pair if ¯r¯s ≤T ¯c holds. Then we set s∗ := rsr−1 ∈ T .

Theorem 9.1. (Bessis [Be]). 1. The monoid M ([1, ¯c]T ) is generated by the set T
and deﬁned by the quadratic relations (1.4) for all non crossing pairs r, s ∈ T .

2. Set T := ∪k∈Z(ckSc−k) ⊂ GP . Then the natural projection π : GP → GP
induces a bijection T ≃ T and, further, an isomorphism from the Artin group GP
to the group G(M ([1, ¯c]T )) ≃ (cid:10)T | relations given in 2.(cid:11)gr (see Footnote 4 for G(·)).

Proof. See [Be. 2.1.4, 2.2.2, 2.2.5, 2.3.3].

(cid:3)

The relations (1.4) are called the dual Artin braid relations. We remark that if
a pair r and s is non-crossing, then the pair s and ∗r:= s−1rs is also non-crossing
(since ¯s ∗¯r = ¯r¯s ≤T ¯c). Therefore, s ·∗ r = r · s is also a dual relation. Let us
show that the monoid M ([1, c]T ), which we shall call the dual Artin monoid, is a
submonoid of the Artin group. To see that, we use a distinguished property of the
monoid.

Theorem 9.2. (Bessis [Be]). 1. The pre-monoid [1, ¯c]T is a lattice.

2. M ([1, ¯c]T ) is a lattice, and hence it is a Garside monoid.
3. The dual Artin monoid Gdual+
submonoid of the Artin group GP generated by T.

P

:= M ([1, ¯c]T ) is naturally isomorphic to the

Proof. 1. The original proof by Bessis [Be, Fact 2.3.1] used the classiﬁcation of
ﬁnite reﬂection groups and was shown case by case. A case free proof is given by
[B-W].

2. To show the lattice property of M ([1, ¯c]T ) from that of [1, ¯c]T is formal (see

[B-S,D, Be, Theorem 2.3.2]).

3. It is a general property that a Garside monoid M is embedded into G(M )
(cid:3)

(see [B-S, Be, Theorem 2.3.2]).

Since the lattice [1, ¯c]T , for the case of type Al, coincides with the lattice of
non-crossing partitions (Kreweras [K], Birman-Ko-Lee [B-K-L]), the lattice [1, ¯c]T
for the case of type P is called a non-crossing partition lattice of types P .

We are interested in studying the skew-growth function NGdual+

,deg(t) (1.6) of

the dual Artin monoid with respect to the degree map (1.2). Let us show

Similarly, we denote by G : CM onoid → CGroup the left adjoint functor of the natural embedding
CGroup → CM onoid of the category of groups to the category of monoids.

Fact 9.3. The skew-growth function NGdual+
polynomial χ[1,¯c]T (t) of the non-crossing partition lattice [1, ¯c]T of type P .

,deg(t) coincides with the characteristic

P

Proof. Recall that the characteristic polynomial of a ﬁnite graded poset L with the
minimal element, denoted by ˆ0, is the generating function of the M¨obius function:

χL(t) = Px∈L µ(ˆ0, x)tdeg(x)

([St] (3.39)). Suppose that L carries a pre-monoid structure and that the poset
structure on L is induced from the (left-)divisibility relation of the pre-monoid
structure (eg. [1, ¯c]T and [1, ∆]S, where 1 plays the role of ˆ0) and let I ⊂ L be the
minimal generator system of the pre-monoid. We consider the graded ring Z[[L]] :=
(Z · M (L))ˆ of the monoid M (L). We note also that 1 ∈ M (L) (corresponding to
the minimal element of L) is the only element whose degree is equal to 0.

Inside the algebra Z[[L]], we obtain the monoid theoretic inversion formula :

(cid:0)PJ ⊂I lcm(J)(cid:1) ·(cid:0)Px∈M(L) x(cid:1) = 1.

([Sa2] Cor. 5.4). Applying to this the operator tdeg, and by setting PM(L),deg(t) :=

Px∈M(L) tdeg(x), we obtain the inversion formula PM(L),deg(t) · NM(L),deg(t) = 1.
inversion formula PM(L),deg(t) ·Px∈L µ(ˆ0, x)tdeg(x) = 1. Thus, combining the both

On the other hand, Cartier-Foata theory [C-F] gives the (combinatorial theoretic)

inversion formulae, we conclude the equality χ[1,¯c]T (t) = NGdual+

(t).

Remark 9.4. The equality χ[1,¯c]T (t) = NGdual+

P

(t) implies the explicit formula:

PJ ⊂I,lcml(J)=x(−1)#J = µ(ˆ0, x).

for all x ∈ L. This can be shown directly by induction on deg(x).

(Proof. First, for deg(x) = 0 the statement is true. Next, by induction hypothe-

sis, we have PJ ⊂I,lcml(J)(cid:8)x(−1)#J = Pz(cid:8)x µ(ˆ0, z). On the other hand, we have
PJ ⊂I,lcml(J)≦x(−1)#J = 0. This implies the explicit formula.)
