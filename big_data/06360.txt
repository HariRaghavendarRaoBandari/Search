We show that the phenomenon of neutrino spectral split, which might be observed in the next
galactic supernova neutrino signal, is analogous to the BCS-BEC crossover already observed in ultra
cold atomic gas experiments. Although these two phenomena belong to two very diﬀerent domains
of physics, the propagation of neutrinos from highly interacting inner regions to the vacuum is
reminiscent of the evolution of Cooper pairs between weak and strong interaction regimes. The
Hamiltonians and the corresponding ground states undergo very similar transformations if one
replaces the pair quasispin of the latter with the neutrino isospin of the former.

Introduction. A core-collapse supernova releases 99%
of its energy in the form of neutrinos in the MeV energy
scale [1, 2]. Our basic understanding about these neutri-
nos was conﬁrmed [3, 4] when supernova 1987A exploded
in our neighbor galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud,
and generated 19 neutrino events in Kamiokande [5] and
IBM [6] detectors. The next important breakthrough in
this ﬁeld will be the observation of neutrinos from a su-
pernova explosion in our own galaxy which is estimated
to generate thousands of neutrino events in current neu-
trino detectors [7]. Therefore a future galactic supernova
presents a unique opportunity to test our understanding
of neutrinos. This includes the many-body aspects of ﬂa-
vor transformation [8, 9] which develop via the neutrino-
neutrino (νν) interactions in the supernova [10, 11].

Although neutrino cross sections are extremely small,
their tiny scattering amplitudes can add up coherently
to give rise to a ﬁnite eﬀect when neutrinos propagate
in the presence of a matter background [12]. This is
similar to the refraction of light in matter except that,
since neutrinos can interact with each other via neutral
current, they can also create a self refraction eﬀect on
themselves [11]. Two kinds of diagrams, shown in Fig. 1,
add up coherently in self refraction: (a) the forward scat-
tering diagram in which there is no momentum transfer
between particles and (b) the exchange diagram in which
particles completely swap their momenta [8, 9]. The for-
mer gives rise to an ordinary refraction index through
the optical theorem [12]. The latter can be viewed as a
ﬂavor-exchange diagram between neutrinos and, as such,
it couples the ﬂavor transformation of each neutrino to
the ﬂavor content of the entire neutrino ensemble. This
turns the ﬂavor evolution of neutrinos near the core of a
supernova into a many-body problem [13–18].

The correlations between ﬂavor histories of neutrinos
with diﬀerent energies, which are referred to as collective
neutrino oscillations, have been extensively studied [19–
23] (see e.g. [24] for a review of the literature). Large

array of nonlinear and emergent behavior displayed by
self interacting neutrinos are reminiscent of condensed
matter systems. A formal analogy between collective
neutrino oscillations and BCS pairing model of supercon-
ductivity [25] has recently been pointed out by Pehlivan
et al. [15, 16] and further elaborated in [26]. Besides the
Cooper pairs of electrons in superconductors, BCS pair-
ing is observed in a broad range of many body systems,
including neutron stars and atomic nuclei [27], ultra cold
atomic gases [28, 29] and excitonic condensates in semi-
conductor structures [30–32].

One collective behavior expected to be displayed by
neutrinos emerging from supernova is the spectral split
or spectral swap phenomenon in which neutrinos in dif-
ferent ﬂavor (or mass) eigenstates completely exchange
their spectra around a certain critical energy [22, 24].
In this letter we show that under the mean ﬁeld and
single angle approximations, and in an eﬀective two ﬂa-
vor mixing scenario, the formation of spectral splits also
corresponds to the well known BCS-BEC crossover phe-
nomenon [33, 34]. We illustrate this correspondence in
ultra cold atomic gases which have been used to simulate
other quantum systems [35, 36] and make analogies with
diﬀerent physical phenomena [37–40].

BCS pairs and self interacting neutrinos. The BCS
model describes the superconducting state of weakly in-
teracting Fermions through a coherent superposition of
Cooper pairs. In ultra cold dilute gas systems, the pair-
ing interaction between fermionic atoms is described by

We assume that the atoms can occupy a discrete set of

time-reversed energy levels. The chemical potential µ is
introduced as a Lagrange multiplier to ﬁx the average
particle number. The interactions can be tuned via Fes-
hbach resonances [41] which function as a control knob
for the coupling constant g. The physics is captured by

The components P ± create the exchange diagrams shown
in Fig. 1b while P 0 creates the forward scattering dia-
gram in Fig. 1a. P 0 contributes to the diagonal of Eq. (3)
and plays a similar role to that of an Hartree potential
for fermionic pairs. In the case of neutrinos, P 0 is always
non-zero, and we include it in the deﬁnition of λ in order
to highlight the resemblance between the two systems.

In Eq. (2),
the expectation values are calculated with respect to a
state which satisﬁes the usual mean ﬁeld self-consistency
requirements.

We assume that neutrinos are box quantized in volume
V and therefore occupy a discrete set of energy levels Ek.
The operator aki annihilates a neutrino in the kth energy
level, in the mass eigenstate with mass mi (i = 1, 2) and
ωk = (m2
2)/2Ek is the oscillation frequency for a
neutrino with energy Ek due to this mass diﬀerence. To
be speciﬁc, we assume that m1 > m2 which corresponds
to inverted mass hierarchy. The Lagrange multiplier λ
plays an analogous role to the chemical potential µ in
Eq. (1) [15].
In describing the νν scattering, Fermi 4-

as neutrinos move away from the center of the supernova,
gradually turning oﬀ the νν interactions with decreasing
neutrino density. Here, we adopt an eﬀective two ﬂavor
mixing scenario
ake = cos ϑak1+ sin ϑak2, akµ = sin ϑak1− cos ϑak2, (4)
where the eﬀects of the third ﬂavor and the other back-
ground particles are absorbed in a single mixing angle ϑ
and a single mass squared diﬀerence (see e.g. [14, 42]). In
Eq. (3), νν interactions are treated within the so called

For convenience, we denote both the pair quasispin and
the neutrino isospin with the same symbol but it is always
clear which one is being referred to from the context. In
both cases, components of (cid:126)Jk obey the SU (2) algebra,

Eq. (7) tells us that for a single energy level k, qua-
sispin up and down states correspond to that level being
occupied (|↑↓—(cid:105)) or unoccupied (|—(cid:105)) by a pair, respec-
tively. Levels occupied by unpaired atoms decouple from
the pairing dynamics and are ignored here. In the case of
neutrinos, Eq. (8) tells us that the isospin up and down
states for energy level k correspond to the neutrino oc-
cupying that energy level being in ν2 and ν1 mass eigen-
state, respectively. Therefore, the analogous states are

| ↑↓—(cid:105) ↔ |ν2(cid:105) and |—(cid:105) ↔ |ν1(cid:105).

(11)

Clearly the particle vacuum of the BCS model has no dy-
namics but neither does the neutrino state on the right
hand side of Eq. (11): since all the neutrinos are in mass
eigenstate, this state does not undergo vacuum oscilla-
tions and since all the neutrinos are in the same mass
eigenstate, exchange diagrams shown in Fig. 1b cannot
change this state either. Acting on both states in Eq. (11)

BCS-BEC crossover and spectral splits. The ground
state of the pairing Hamiltonian evolves from weakly
bound Cooper pairs in the BCS limit of weak interactions
to the Bose-Einstein condensation of tightly bound di-
atomic molecules in the limit of strong interactions. This
evolution takes place without a phase transition as the
interaction strength is varied and hence the ground state
can be described by the same variational BCS wave func-
tion throughout the crossover between the BCS and BEC
limits [44, 45]. The theoretical prediction has been exper-
imentally observed in ultra cold atomic systems [46–50].

which annihilate the BCS ground state so that |BCS(cid:105) can
be viewed as a quasiparticle vacuum.

In the weak interaction limit, Eq. (13b) yields
limg→0 θk = (π/2)Θ(F − k) where Θ(x) denotes the
Heaviside step function and limg→0 µ = F is the Fermi
energy. The upper left panel of Fig. 2 shows the
corresponding occupation numbers which follow from
Eqs. (14) in this limit. The particle pairs ﬁll the levels
up to the Fermi energy and the system displays the char-
acteristic distribution of a degenerate ideal Fermi gas.
According to Eq. (13b), the angle θk tends to the same
value for all pairs in the limit of strong interactions, i.e.,
limg→∞ θk = θ. In this limit, |BCS(cid:105) represents a BEC in
the form a coherent state of atomic pairs occupying the
same single-pair quantum state. The upper right panel
of Fig. 2 displays the occupation numbers of particle and
hole pairs, in blue dashed and red dotted lines respec-
tively, which are almost uniform in this limit. The solid
black line shows the number of quasihole pairs equal to
unity because |BCS(cid:105) is the quasiparticle vacuum. The
typical evolution of the chemical potential in the BCS-
BEC crossover from positive values to negative values is
shown in the left panel of Fig. 3 as a function of the in-
verse scattering length, the parameter characterizing the
strength of the pairing interaction.

Here the angle θk is given by the same formula as in
Eq. (13b) with the replacements k → ωk/2, µ → λ/2,
g → G/2 and ∆± → P ±. Eq. (5) determines the
neutrino mean ﬁeld and the Lagrange multiplier λ self-
consistently. Due to the overall sign diﬀerence between
the two Hamiltonians given in Eq. (9), |“BCS”(cid:105) is not the
ground state of the neutrino Hamiltonian, but its highest
energy eigenstate. However, since the energy spectra of
the two Hamiltonians are the same apart from an overall
sign, |“BCS”(cid:105) should also evolve smoothly between strong
and weak interaction regimes without a phase transition
(i.e., with no level crossing).

Using Eq. (6), one can also deﬁne the analogs of the

quasiparticle operators introduced in Eq. (14)
†
†
†
˜ak2=cos θkak2−sin θkak1, ˜a
k1=sin θka

which similarly annihilate the |“BCS”(cid:105) state.

For neutrinos, the limit of strong self interactions is
realized near the core of the supernova. In general, the
ﬂavor composition of neutrinos released from the core
depends on the explosion phase. Here we consider a spe-
cial case in which all neutrinos are released as νe, which
is more relevant for the initial stages of the explosion.
For such a conﬁguration, the solution of the consistency
equations given in Eq. (5) yield limG→∞ θk = ϑ where
ϑ is the neutrino mixing angle introduced in Eq. (4).
This is similar to the BEC regime of the fermion pairs.
Substituting this angle in Eq. (15) and using Eq. (4)
gives |“BCS”(cid:105) = |νe νe νe . . .(cid:105) which conﬁrms the self-
consistency of the state. In this limit, the quasiparticle
operators which annihilate this state become the particle
†
†
operators in ﬂavor basis, i.e., ˜ak2 = akµ and ˜a
k1 = a
ke.
In the lower right panel of Fig. 2, we plot neutrino oc-
cupation numbers associated with the |“BCS”(cid:105) state in
this limit. Note that, although the pairing Hamiltonian
in Eq. (1) describes the atomic pairs at ultra low tem-
peratures, the Hamiltonian in Eq. (3) represents self in-
teractions of neutrinos for any (thermal or non-thermal)
energy distribution. The main features of the analogy
is independent of the neutrino energy distribution. For
illustration, we use a thermal νe distribution with a tem-
perature of 5 MeV which is shown with the solid-black
line. The corresponding ν1 and ν2 occupation numbers
which follow from Eq. (4) are shown with red-dotted and
blue-dashed lines, respectively.

As the neutrinos move away from the core of the su-
pernova, νν interactions are gradually turned oﬀ. In this
limit where limG→0 λ = ωc, the state |“BCS”(cid:105) in Eq. (15)

the adiabatic evolution conditions. This distribution is
plotted in the lower left panel of Fig. 2 and corresponds
to the BCS limit of the fermion pairing. The evolution
of neutrinos from G → ∞ limit to the G → 0 limit (from
right to left in the lower panel of Fig. 2) is a particular
example of a spectral split. This phenomenon was ob-
served in numerical simulations of supernova neutrinos
by various groups (see [24] for a review).

Summary & Conclusions. We showed an analogy
between the neutrino spectral split and the BCS-BEC
crossover phenomenon under certain simplifying assump-
tions. This analogy is most intuitively illustrated us-
ing the BCS model of ultra cold atomic gases. Due to
their mathematically equivalent Hamiltonians, these sys-
tems undergo identical transformations while they evolve
from strong to weak interaction regimes.
In particu-
lar, the Fermi energy of the BCS model and the critical
split frequency of neutrinos play analogous roles. Note
that although the pair quasispin and the neutrino isospin
obey the same algebra, the latter is number conserving
whereas the former is not. As a result, in Eqs. (11-12),
BCS pair states live in a Fock space whereas the neutrino
states live in a regular Hilbert space.

Other quantum many-body systems, in which the rel-
ative strength of kinetic and interaction energies is den-
sity dependent, might also have been considered in lieu of
ultra cold atomic Fermi gases in our discussion. For in-
stance, in the context of excitonic condensates, the BCS-
BEC crossover is driven by density.
In such electronic
systems with long range Coulomb interactions, some-
what counter-intuitively, the low density limit results in
a strongly interacting system. For neutrinos, the self in-
teraction term is density dependent because many scat-
tering amplitudes must coherently superpose to generate
the eﬀect. Thus, unlike the case of excitonic conden-
sates, the relative strength of neutrino self interactions
decreases with density.

In the full three ﬂavor mixing case neutrino isospin
generalizes to an SU (3) operator [16]. There are pairing
scenarios for atomic systems [51, 52] and in QCD [53]
suggesting similar analogies in this case. The insight
gained with direct experimentation in condensed mat-
ter and atomic physics may help us to understand some
aspects of the collective neutrino oscillations in the su-
pernova for which we do not yet have any observation.
These include possible departures from the mean ﬁeld
approximation [15–17, 54, 55], or from adiabaticity [56],
the factors aﬀecting the split frequency [57–59], and pos-
sible instabilities of split behavior [23, 60], some of which
will be subjects of future study.
