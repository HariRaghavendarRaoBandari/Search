EMBEDDING PROPERTIES OF HEREDITARILY JUST

INFINITE PROFINITE WREATH PRODUCTS

BENJAMIN KLOPSCH AND MATTEO VANNACCI

Abstract. We study inﬁnitely iterated wreath products of ﬁnite
permutation groups w.r.t. product actions. In particular, we prove
that, for every non-empty class of ﬁnite simple groups X , there ex-
ists a ﬁnitely generated hereditarily just inﬁnite proﬁnite group W
with composition factors in X such that any countably based proﬁ-
nite group with composition factors in X can be embedded into W .
Additionally we investigate when inﬁnitely iterated wreath prod-
ucts of ﬁnite simple groups w.r.t. product actions are co-Hopﬁan
or non-co-Hopﬁan.

1. Introduction and main results

1.1. Introduction. A proﬁnite group G is just inﬁnite if G is inﬁnite
and every non-trivial closed normal subgroup N Ec G is open in G.
While a complete classiﬁcation of just inﬁnite proﬁnite groups is way
out of reach, there is a natural interest in understanding as much about
their structure as possible. It is known (e.g., see [7, Theorem 3]) that
every just inﬁnite proﬁnite group is either a proﬁnite branch group
or it contains open subgroup isomorphic to the direct product of a
ﬁnite number of copies of a hereditarily just inﬁnite proﬁnite group,
where a proﬁnite group G is called hereditarily just inﬁnite if every
open subgroup H ≤o G is just inﬁnite. While branch groups have been
studied quite extensively (e.g., see [2]) comparatively little is known
about hereditarily just inﬁnite groups.

Well-known families of hereditarily just inﬁnite proﬁnite groups are
supplied by compact open subgroups of simple algebraic groups over
non-archimedean local ﬁelds, such as SLn(Zp) or SLn(Fp[[t]]). In addi-
tion there are some ‘sporadic’ non-linear examples, such as Aut(Fp[[t]])
and certain subgroups thereof; see [3, 1, 5].
In [15, Theorem A],
J. S. Wilson gave the ﬁrst examples of hereditarily just inﬁnite proﬁ-
nite groups that are not virtually pro-p for any prime p. They arise as
certain iterated wreath products of non-abelian ﬁnite simple groups,
and retrospectively the construction is very ﬂexible. In [15, 9, 13] some
embedding, generation and presentation properties of such groups have

been established, but many of their features are not yet fully under-
stood. In passing, we remark that A. Lucchini has used crown-based
powers to manufacture further examples of hereditarily just inﬁnite
proﬁnite groups; see [8]. Interesting new types of hereditarily just inﬁ-
nite pro-p groups were constructed by Ershov and Jaikin in [6].

In this paper we focus on hereditarily just inﬁnite proﬁnite groups
that are obtained as inverse limits of iterated wreath products w.r.t.
product actions. They arise as follows; see Section 2 for a more detailed
description. Let S = (Sk)k∈N∪{0}, with Sk ≤ Sym(Ωk), be a sequence
of ﬁnite transitive permutation groups. The inverse limit

is called the inﬁnitely iterated wreath product of type S w.r.t. product
actions.

By [10, Theorem 6.2] and [9], every inﬁnitely iterated wreath product
w.r.t. product actions W pa(S), based on a sequence S of ﬁnite non-
abelian simple permutation groups, is a ﬁnitely generated hereditarily
just inﬁnite proﬁnite group that is not virtually pro-p for any prime p.

1.2. Main results. The aim of this paper is to study embedding prop-
erties of inﬁnitely iterated wreath product of ﬁnite non-abelian simple
groups w.r.t. product actions. Speciﬁcally, we are interested in embed-
dings of countably based proﬁnite groups with speciﬁed (topological)
composition factors into such wreath products. By [15, Theorem A]
and [9], there exists a ﬁnitely generated hereditarily just inﬁnite proﬁ-
nite group G such that every countably based proﬁnite group can be
embedded into G as a closed subgroup. Our ﬁrst theorem is a re-
ﬁnement of this result to proﬁnite groups with restricted composition
factors. Recall that, by virtue of the Jordan–H¨older Theorem for ﬁnite
groups, every countably based proﬁnite group G has a countable set of
composition factors with well-deﬁned multiplicities; cf. Section 2.

Theorem A. Let S = (Sn)n∈N∪{0} be a sequence of ﬁnite simple groups.
Then every proﬁnite group G that admits a composition series

G = G1 ⊲ G2 ⊲ . . . with factors Gk/Gk+1

∼= Sk, k ∈ N,

embeds as a closed subgroup into the inﬁnitely iterated wreath product
W pa(S) of type S = (Sk)k∈N∪{0} w.r.t. product actions, where each
Sk ≤ Sym(Sk) acts regularly on itself by right multiplication.

HEREDITARILY JUST INFINITE PROFINITE WREATH PRODUCTS

We emphasise that Theorem A includes the possibility of some of the
simple groups Sk being cyclic. Making further adjustments, we con-
struct for any given class of ﬁnite simple groups X an inﬁnitely iterated
wreath product W pa(SX ) with composition factors in X that is ‘ver-
sal’ for embedding countably based proﬁnite group with composition
factors in X .

Corollary B. Let X be a non-empty class of ﬁnite simple groups.
Then there exists a sequence SX = (Sk)k∈N of groups Sk ∈ X , where
each Sk ≤ Sym(Sk) acts regularly on itself by right multiplication, such
that every countably based proﬁnite group with composition factors in X
embeds as a closed subgroup into the inﬁnitely iterated wreath product
W pa(SX ) of type SX .

Our proof of Theorem A relies on an apparently little known con-
struction to embed iterated wreath products w.r.t. imprimitive actions
into iterated wreath products w.r.t. product actions; see Proposition 3.3
and its Corollary 3.4.

Furthermore we are interested in when inﬁnitely iterated wreath
products of ﬁnite simple groups w.r.t. product actions are or fail to
be co-Hopﬁan. Recall that a proﬁnite group G is co-Hopﬁan, if there
exists no proper closed subgroup H (cid:8)c G with H ∼= G. Our descrip-
tion of non-co-Hopﬁan groups relies on the following concept of ‘sub-
embeddings’ for permutation groups; see Deﬁnition 3.2 for a natural
generalisation.

Deﬁnition. We say that a permutation group H ≤ Sym(∆) sub-

γ(δ)ι(h) for all δ ∈ ∆ and h ∈ H. For instance, the permutation group
H = h(1 2)i ≤ Sym(2) sub-embeds into G = h(1 2)(3 4)i ≤ Sym(4) via

embeds into a permutation group G ≤ Sym(Ω) if there exist eH ≤ G
and an eH-invariant subset e∆ ⊆ Ω such that H ≤ Sym(∆) is equivalent
to the induced permutation group eH| e∆ ≤ Sym(e∆): there exist a group
isomorphism ι : H → eH and a bijection γ : ∆ → e∆ such that γ(δh) =
eH = G and e∆ = {1, 2}.

Observe that the relation “sub-embeds” on permutation groups is
transitive. We call a sequence S = (Sk)k∈N of ﬁnite permutation groups
Sk ≤ Sym(Ωk) eventually self-sub-embedding, if there exists n0 ∈ N
such that, for every j ∈ N≥n0, there is at least one (equivalently: there
are inﬁnitely many) k ∈ N>j for which Sj ≤ Sym(Ωj) sub-embeds into
Sk ≤ Sym(Ωk).

We establish the following results.

Theorem C. Let S = (Sk)k∈N be a sequence of non-trivial ﬁnite per-
mutation groups Sk ≤ Sym(Ωk). If S is eventually self-sub-embedding,
then the inﬁnitely iterated wreath product W pa(S) of type S is non-co-
Hopﬁan.

4

BENJAMIN KLOPSCH AND MATTEO VANNACCI

Theorem C applies,

in particular, to constant sequences of ﬁnite
simple groups, but also to the sequence S = (Sk)k∈N of pairwise non-
isomorphic alternating groups Sk = Alt(k + 4) ≤ Sym(k + 4).

For our ﬁnal result, recall that a ﬁnite group S is minimal non-
abelian simple if it is non-abelian simple and every proper subgroup of
S is soluble; such groups were classiﬁed by J. G. Thompson [11, 12]
well before the classiﬁcation of all ﬁnite simple groups.

Corollary D. Let S = (Sk)k∈N be a sequence of ﬁnite transitive per-
mutation groups Sk ≤ Sym(Ωk) that are minimal non-abelian simple.
Then the inﬁnitely iterated wreath product W pa(S) is non-co-Hopﬁan
if and only if S is eventually self-sub-embedding.

Observe that in the setting of the corollary, S is eventually self-sub-

embedding if and only if almost all terms occur inﬁnitely often in S.

To build an explicit example, we recall that the minimal ﬁnite non-
abelian simple groups are: PSL2(2p) for any prime p, PSL2(3p) for any
odd prime p, PSL2(p) where p > 3 and 5 divides p2 + 1, Sz(2p) for any
odd prime p and PSL3(3).

Let (pk)k∈N be any sequence of prime numbers without repeated
terms. Then the inﬁnitely iterated wreath product w.r.t. product
actions of type S = (Sk)k∈N, with Sk = PSL2(2pk) ≤ Sym(2pk + 1)
acting on the projective line over F2pk , is co-Hopﬁan.

2. Preliminaries

In this section we collect some deﬁnitions that provide a more general
context for our main theorems and serve as ingredients for the proofs.

2.1. Iterated wreath products. First we elaborate on the concept of
an inﬁnitely iterated wreath product. Let S = (Sk)k∈N be a sequence
of ﬁnite groups. One can deﬁne, in many ways, a new sequence of

permutation groups bS = (bSk)k∈N, with bSk ≤ Sym(bmk), recursively as
follows: (i) set bS1 = S1 and choose a transitive faithful action of bS1 on
a ﬁnite set bΩ1; (ii) for k ≥ 2, let bSk be the wreath product Sk ≀ bSk−1
w.r.t. the given transitive faithful action of bSk−1 and choose a transitive
faithful action of bSk on a ﬁnite set bΩk. For each k ∈ N, the group
bSk is called a k-fold iterated wreath product of type (S1, . . . , Sk). The
resulting sequence bS constitutes in a natural way an inverse system of
←−bSk an inﬁnitely iterated wreath

ﬁnite groups; we call its inverse limit lim
product of type S.

The inﬁnitely iterated wreath products w.r.t. product actions, dis-
cussed in the introduction, fall into this scheme. We are, in fact, in-
terested also in ﬁnitely iterated wreath products w.r.t. product actions
and in iterated wreath products w.r.t. imprimitive actions. We employ
≀(cid:13) and ≀ to distinguish between wreath products w.r.t.

product actions and imprimitive actions. Using notation that is cho-
sen to ﬁt our later applications, we describe the two constructions as
follows.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let S = (Sk)k∈N∪{0} be a sequence of ﬁnite permuta-
tion groups Sk ≤ Sym(Ωk), and set S ′ = (Sk)k∈N.

2.2. Composition series. Let G be a countably based proﬁnite group.
Recall that every descending sequence G = G1 o≥ G2 o≥ . . . of open

tity element; see [14, Lemma 0.3.1(h)]. A composition series (Gn)n∈N
for G consists of open subnormal subgroups G = G1 ⊲ G2 ⊲ . . . with

subgroups with Tn Gn = 1 forms a neighbourhood basis of the iden-
Tn Gn = 1 and ﬁnite simple composition factors Sn = Gn/Gn+1 for

n ∈ N; we refer to S = (Sn)n∈N as a sequence of composition factors
for G. The Jordan–H¨older Theorem for ﬁnite groups implies that any
two composition series of G are equivalent in the sense that the com-
position factors (up to isomorphism) occur with the same multiplicities
in both series.

3. Embedding theorems

In this section we establish the following basic fact which leads di-

rectly to a proof of Theorem A.

Proposition 3.1. Let S = (Sk)k∈N∪{0} be a sequence of ﬁnite simple
groups, where each Sk ≤ Sym(Sk) forms a permutation group via the
right regular action. Then the inﬁnitely iterated wreath product W ia(S ′)
of type S ′ = (Sk)k∈N w.r.t. imprimitive actions embeds as a closed

subgroup into the inﬁnitely iterated wreath product W pa(S) of type S =
(Sk)k∈N∪{0} w.r.t. product actions.
Proof of Theorem A. Set S ′ = (Sn)n∈N, and let G be a countably based
proﬁnite group that admits S ′ as a sequence of composition factors. Re-
peated applications of [4, Theorem 2.6A] and a standard compactness
argument yield a continuous injective homomorphism

(3.1)

G ֒→ lim
←−
n∈N

W ia(S ′

n) = W ia(S ′).

Proposition 3.1 shows that W ia(S ′) and hence also G embed as closed
subgroups into W pa(S).
(cid:3)

The proof of Proposition 3.1 relies on a construction regarding ﬁnite
wreath products. For any set X let P(X) = {Y | Y ⊆ X} denote the
power set of X, and, for any given cardinal r, we write Pr(X) = {Y ∈
P(X) | |Y | = r}. A permutation group G ≤ Sym(Ω) has a natural
induced permutation action on each Pr(Ω), via Γg = {γg | γ ∈ Γ} for
Γ ⊆ Ω and g ∈ G.

Deﬁnition 3.2. Let H ≤ Sym(∆) and G ≤ Sym(Ω) be permutation
groups. Consider the induced action of G on Pr(Ω) for some cardinal r.
We say that H is P-embedded of degree r in G if there exist

In other words, H ≤ Sym(∆) is P-embedded of degree r in G ≤ Sym(Ω)

◦ a collection e∆ ⊆ Pr(Ω) of pairwise disjoint sets and
◦ a subgroup eH ≤ G such that e∆ is eH-invariant and the action
of eH on e∆ is equivalent to the action of H on ∆.
if there exist an isomorphism ι : H → eH ≤ G and a bijection Γ : ∆ →
e∆ ⊆ Pr(Ω) such that

for δ ∈ ∆ and h ∈ H.

Γ(δh) = Γ(δ)ι(h)

We remark that P-embeddings of degree 1 are essentially the same as
the sub-embeddings described in the introduction.

Proposition 3.3. Let H ≤ Sym(∆), G ≤ Sym(Σ) and S ≤ Sym(Ω)
be non-trivial ﬁnite permutation groups. Suppose that

(3.2)

and

ι : H → eH ≤ G

Γ : ∆ → e∆ ⊆ Pr(Σ)

provide a P-embedding of degree r ≥ 2.

Then the imprimitive wreath product V = S ≀H ≤ Sym(Ω×∆) can be
P-embedded into the primitive wreath product W = S ≀(cid:13) G ≤ Sym(ΩΣ).
More speciﬁcally, writing Φ = Ω × ∆, there is a P-embedding of degree

br ≥ 2 via
such thatbι induces, upon factoring out the base groups on both sides,

Proof. We identify W = S ≀(cid:13) G with A ⋊ G, where A = SΣ denotes the
base group. Elements (sσ)σ ∈ A and g ∈ G operate on ΩΣ by

f (sσ)σ (τ ) = f (τ )sτ

and f g(τ ) = f (τ g−1

)

for f ∈ ΩΣ, τ ∈ Σ.

Similarly we identify V = S ≀ H with B ⋊ H, where B = S∆ denotes
the base group. Elements (sδ)δ ∈ B and h ∈ H operate on Ω × ∆ by

(ω, ε)(sδ)δ = (ωsε, ε) and (ω, ε)h = (ω, εh)

for (ω, ε) ∈ Ω × ∆.

For n = 1, it suﬃces to observe that Sm(1) sub-embeds into the

embedding of Sm(1) into the base group acting on constant functions.

for l ∈ {1, . . . , m(n) − m(n − 1) − 1}. The ﬁnal value for l yields the
requested sub-embedding into W pa(Sm(n)).

Claim (2) follows from the above construction and the compatibility
(cid:3)

assertion built into Lemma 4.2.

The proofs of Corollary B and Theorem C are now immediate.

Proof of Corollary B. Choose representatives X1, X2, . . . for the iso-
morphism types of ﬁnite simple groups in X , and consider the sequence
SX consisting of

X1, X1, X2, X1, X2, X3, . . . , X1, X2 . . . , Xn, . . . .

Then every countably based proﬁnite group with composition factors
in X has a composition series that forms, up to isomorphisms, a sub-
sequence of SX . Now apply Proposition 4.3.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem C. Suppose that S = (Sk)k∈N, with Sk ≤ Sym(Ωk),
is eventually self-sub-embedding. Choose n0 ∈ N and a strictly increas-
ing, but non-identity function m : N>n0 → N>n0 such that

◦ the wreath product W pa(Sn0) of type Sn0 = (S1, . . . , Sn0) acts

on more than 2 points,

◦ for each j ∈ N>n0, the permutation group Sj ≤ Sym(Ωj) sub-

embeds into Sm(j) ≤ Sym(Ωm(j)).

Arguing similarly to the proof of Proposition 4.3 and applying, in ad-
dition, Lemma 4.1 in the induction step, we obtain an embedding of
W pa(S) as a proper closed subgroup into itself.

HEREDITARILY JUST INFINITE PROFINITE WREATH PRODUCTS

11

Theorem C highlights two natural questions. Do there exist inﬁnitely
iterated wreath products of ﬁnite simple groups w.r.t. product actions
that are co-Hopﬁan? To what extent are the hypotheses of Theorem C
irredundant? Corollary D provides positive answers to both questions,
when we restrict ourselves to minimal ﬁnite non-abelian simple groups.

Proof of Corollary D. In view of Theorem C only one implication re-
mains to be shown. Denote by G = W pa(S) the inﬁnitely iterated
wreath product of type S w.r.t. product actions. Here S consists of
minimal ﬁnite non-abelian simple groups Sk ≤ Sym(Ωk), each equipped
with a transitive permutation action. Suppose that for every n0 ∈ N
there exists k ≥ n0 such that Sk ≤ Sym(Ωk) sub-embeds and hence
is equivalent to Sj ≤ Sym(Ωj) for only ﬁnitely many j ∈ N. Suppose
further that H ≤c G with H ∼= G. We need to show that H = G.

Since the action of each Sj on Ωj is transitive, it is easy to see that
the open normal subgroups of G form a descending chain G = N0 ⊇
N1 ⊇ . . ., where

Nl = ker(G → W pa(Sl))

for l ∈ N.

The group H ∼= G has a corresponding chain of open normal subgroups
H = M0 ⊇ M1 ⊇ . . ..

For every n ∈ N we choose m(n) ∈ N such that H ∩ Nn = Mm(n)
∼= HNn/Nn ≤ G/Nn implies
and observe that G/Nm(n)
m(n) ≤ n. Moreover, it is enough to show that m(n) ≥ n, hence
n = m(n), for inﬁnitely many n ∈ N; for this implies HNn = G for
inﬁnitely many n, and thus H = G.

∼= H/Mm(n)

Now, start with any large number n0 ∈ N. By our hypotheses, there

is a k ≥ n0 such that

n = min{j ∈ N | Sk ≤ Sym(Ωk) is not equivalent to Sl ≤ Sym(Ωl)
for any l > j} ∈ N≥n0

is ﬁnite. Clearly, the set of composition factors of Nn is {Sj | j > n}.
In particular, the group Nn does not have any composition factors
isomorphic to Sk.

Set m = m(n) and assume, for a contradiction, that m < n. Then
Nn ≥ H ∩ Nn = Mm ≥ Mn−1. Observe that there exist K Eo Mn−1
such that X = Mn−1/K is isomorphic to Sk. We claim that X is also a
composition factor of Nn. Indeed, by intersecting a composition series
for Nn (possessing exclusively minimal non-abelian simple factors) with
Mn−1 we obtain a subnormal series of Mn−1 with factors that are either
soluble or isomorphic to a composition factor of Nn. This implies that
each composition factor of Mn−1 is either soluble or isomorphic to a
composition factor of Nn. Consequently, X ∼= Sk is isomorphic to a
composition factor of Nn, a contradiction.
