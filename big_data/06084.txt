INTEGRABLE ACTIONS AND QUANTUM SUBGROUPS

PAWE L KASPRZAK, FATEMEH KHOSRAVI, AND PIOTR M. SO LTAN

Abstract. We study homomorphisms of locally compact quantum groups from the point of
view of integrability of the associated action. For a given homomorphism of quantum groups
Π : H → G we introduce quantum groups H/ker Π and im Π corresponding to the classical
quotient by kernel and closure of image. We show that if the action of H on G associated to
Π is integrable then H/ker Π ∼= im Π and characterize such Π. As a particular case we consider
an injective continuous homomorphism Π : H → G between locally compact groups H and G.
Then Π yields an integrable action of H on L∞(G) if and only if its image is closed and Π is a
homeomorphism of H onto im Π.

We also give characterizations of open quantum subgroups and of compact quantum sub-
groups in terms of integrability and show that a closed quantum subgroup always gives rise to an
integrable action. Moreover we prove that quantum subgroups closed in the sense of Woronow-
icz whose associated homomorphism of quantum groups yields an integrable action are closed
in the sense of Vaes.

1. Introduction

The theory of locally compact quantum groups is by now a well established branch of mathe-
matical research. Once the details of the deﬁnition of a locally compact quantum group have been
worked out in a series of papers (cf. e.g. [16, 17, 18]) and a lot of work has been done on examples
of such objects ([20, 32, 36, 21, 26, 31, 30]), a number of deep results of the theory of locally
compact groups have been generalized and analyzed from the point of view of the new theory of
quantum groups ([28, 15, 29]). These papers pointed the way to a more thorough analysis of such
basic concepts as subgroups ([4]) or homomorphisms ([19]) as well as actions ([28], [27, Chapter
2], see also [22]).

In this paper we continue this line of research by analyzing the concept of an integrable action
in the context of homomorphisms of quantum groups. We show that integrability of actions
associated to homomorphisms is deeply connected with the notion of a closed quantum subgroup.
For a homomorphism of quantum groups we introduce and study quantum groups which are non-
commutative analogs of the closure of the image of the homomorphism and the quotient by the
kernel of the homomorphism. Integrability of the associated action is then equivalent to a condition
which can be interpreted as compactness of the kernel and closeness of the image together with a
natural isomorphism of the image with quotient by kernel.

These considerations provide a way to show that the diﬀerence between the two notions of a
closed quantum subgroup analyzed in [4] lies precisely in the integrability of the associated action.
In particular a Woronowicz-closed quantum subgroup (see the end of Section 6 or [4, Section 3])
with its associated action integrable is closed (in the sense of Vaes, see [4]). These results have an
overlap with [5, Proposition 3.12] with also practically the same technique of proof.

We also provide characterization of open and compact quantum subgroups in terms of integra-
bility of certain natural actions associated with them (but not with the homomorphism mapping
the quantum subgroup into the ambient quantum group). The former is then used in other re-
sults on integrability, while the latter is of decidedly diﬀerent nature and is hence placed in the
Appendix.

Our results are also of interest in the case the considered quantum groups are in fact classical
In particular, if H and G are locally compact groups and

locally compact quantum groups.

Π : H → G is an injective continuous homomorphism then the integrability of the associated
action of H on L∞(G) is equivalent to Π being a homeomorphism onto its closed image.

Let us give a more detailed account of the contents of the paper. In Section 2 we collect the main
deﬁnitions and preliminary results about operator algebras and locally compact quantum groups.
We discuss in detail the notions of actions, homomorphisms and closed quantum subgroups of
locally compact quantum groups. We also discuss the notion of the canonical implementation of
an action ([28]) which is one of our crucial tools. Section 3 is devoted to the proof of an integrability
criterion for ergodic actions. This is very much in the spirit of some of the results of [15], but the
type of actions considered is diﬀerent.

In Section 4 we introduce the quantum groups which play the role of closure of the image and
quotient by kernel of a homomorphism of locally compact quantum groups. We also generalize the
latter construction to introduce quotient by the kernel of an action (an example of this construction
already appeared in literature). The short Section 5 sheds light on the canonical implementation of
the action associated to a homomorphism of quantum groups and recalls an integrability criterion
from [28]. Then, in Section 6 all of our main results are obtained.

The Appendix (Section 7) contains discussion of consequences of our results for classical groups
and a theorem characterizing compact quantum subgroups of locally compact quantum groups in
terms of integrability of the canonical action on the homogeneous space. We also recall several
facts about convolutions of various classes of functionals on C∗-algebras and von Neumann alge-
bras associated to a quantum group and prove a few results necessary for the above mentioned
characterization of compact quantum subgroups. Some of these results are also used earlier (in
Section 5).

2. Preliminaries

We will use the language and notation of operator algebras for locally compact quantum groups.
The operator algebraic prerequisites are contained e.g. in [24]. Some notions related to C∗-algebras
like morphisms or multipliers may be found e.g. in [33, 34]. We will also use the concept of an
operator valued weight ([7]) in the context of invariant weights on locally compact quantum groups
([27, 28, 17]). The symbol σ will always denote the ﬂip morphism between tensor product of
operator algebras. Almost all tensor products will be denoted by the symbol ⊗ with the precise
meaning depending on the context. The only exception will be the tensor product of von Neumann
algebras which we will denote by ¯⊗ .

2.1. Locally compact quantum groups. We refer to [16, 17, 18] for fundamentals of the theory
of locally compact quantum groups. Our conventions are those introduced in e.g. [1, 35, 23, 4].
Thus a locally compact quantum group G is described by a von Neumann algebra L∞(G) with
comultiplication ∆G : L∞(G) → L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(G). The right Haar weight on L∞(G) will be
denoted by h with corresponding GNS Hilbert space denoted by L2(G) and associated GNS map
η ([18, Appendix B]). The modular operator and conjugation for h will be denoted by ∇ and J
respectively. We will also denote by L1(G) the space L∞(G)∗ of σ-weakly continuous functionals
on L∞(G). The left Haar weight will be denoted by hL.

The symbols C0(G) and Cu

0(G) will denote the reduced and universal C∗-algebra related to
G. Since C0(G) ⊂ L∞(G) we will use ∆G to also denote the comultiplication on C0(G), so we
have ∆G ∈ Mor(C0(G), C0(G) ⊗ C0(G)), while the comultiplication on Cu
0(G) will be denoted by
0(G) are endowed with much more natural structure. In
∆u
particular there is the scaling group (τt)t∈R and unitary antipode R ([35, 16, 23]).

G. The algebras L∞(G), C0(G) and Cu

The Kac-Takesaki operator or the right regular representation of G is the unitary operator WG

which extends the map

to the level of L2(G) ⊗ L2(G).

η(a) ⊗ η(b) 7−→ (η ⊗ η)(cid:0)∆(a)(1 ⊗ b)(cid:1)

It turns out that WG is a multiplicative unitary operator on L2(G) ⊗ L2(G) and G is the object

related to this multiplicative unitary via the theory developed in [1, 35]. Thus, in particular

◮ L∞(G) =(cid:8)(ω ⊗ id)WG ω ∈ B(L2(G))∗(cid:9)σ-weak closure
The multiplicative unitary gives rise to the dual bG of G which turns out to also be a locally
compact quantum group. In particular there is a right Haar weight bh on L∞(bG), where
The GNS Hilbert space for bh can and will be naturally identiﬁed with L2(G) and in fact W
σ(cid:0)WG ∗(cid:1) and WG ∈ M(C0(bG) ⊗ C0(G)). Moreover, denoting by b∇ and bJ the modular operator
and conjugation related to bh we have

L∞(bG) =(cid:8)(id ⊗ ω)WG ω ∈ B(L2(G))∗(cid:9)σ-weak closure

x ∈ L∞(G),

reducing morphisms ([23, Deﬁnition 35]) then WG = (Λ bG ⊗ ΛG)VV
VVG are WG = (id⊗ΛG)VVG ∈ M(Cu

The results of [14, 23, 19] provide a lift of WG ∈ M(C0(bG) ⊗ C0(G)) to an element VVG ∈
0(bG) ⊗ Cu

0(G), C0(G)) are
G. The “half-lifted” versions of
0(G)).
Let G be a locally compact quantum group and let L ⊂ L∞(G) be a von Neumann subalgebra.
We say that L is a left coideal if ∆G(L) ⊂ L∞(G) ¯⊗ L. If, moreover, L satisﬁes ∆G(L) ⊂ L ¯⊗ L
then we say that L is an invariant subalgebra (this terminology was introduced in [25]). Finally
an invariant subalgebra L such that R(L) = L and τt(L) = L for all t ∈ R is called a Baaj-Vaes
subalgebra. The important Baaj-Vaes theorem ([2, Proposition 10.5]) says that if L ⊂ L∞(G) is a
Baaj-Vaes subalgebra then there exists a locally compact quantum group K such that L = L∞(K)

0(bG))⊗C0(G)) and WG = (Λ bG ⊗id)VVG ∈ M(C0(bG)⊗Cu

0(bG), C0(bG)) and ΛG ∈ Mor(Cu

and ∆K = ∆G(cid:12)(cid:12)L.
If L ⊂ L∞(G) is a left coideal then by [12, Proposition 3.5] the relative commutant L′ ∩ L∞(bG)
is a left coideal in L∞(bG) called the co-dual of L and is denoted by eL. By [12, Theorem 3.9] we
have eeL = L for any left coideal L ⊂ L∞(G).

2.2. Actions of quantum groups. Let H be a locally compact quantum group. A right action of
H on a von Neumann algebra N is an injective normal unital ∗-homomorphism α : N → N ¯⊗ L∞(H)
such that (α ⊗ id) ◦ α = (id ⊗ ∆H) ◦ α. Since most of the time we will only use right actions,
the term “action” will always refer to a right action. Similarly to a right action we deﬁne a left
action of H on N as an injective normal unital ∗-homomorphism β : N → L∞(H) ¯⊗ N such that
(id ⊗ β) ◦ β = (∆H ⊗ id) ◦ β.

Let α : N → N ¯⊗ L∞(H) be a (right) action of H on N. The crossed product of N by (the
action of) H is deﬁned as the von Neumann subalgebra of N ¯⊗ B(L2(H)) generated by α(N) and

1 ¯⊗ L∞(bH). The crossed product will be denoted by the symbol N ⋊α H.

Let us note that there is a simple passage from right to left actions (and conversely). Indeed,
if α : N → N ¯⊗ L∞(H) is a right action of H on N then β = σ ◦ α : N → L∞(H) ¯⊗ N is a left action
of Hop, i.e. the locally compact quantum group H with reversed comultiplication ∆Hop = σ ◦ ∆H.
This allows simple translation of many results about right actions to left actions.

The central notion of this paper is that of an integrable action. The concept of integrability of an
action of a locally compact group was introduced in [3, Deﬁnition 2.6] for locally compact groups.
The deﬁnition can easily be generalized to Kac algebras and locally compact quantum groups as
was done e.g. in [27, Deﬁnition 2.3.4], [28, Deﬁnition 1.4]. Thus an action α : N → N ¯⊗ L∞(H) is
integrable if the set

(2.1)
is σ-weakly dense in N+. Elements of (2.1) are called integrable for α. Similarly an element x ∈ N
is square integrable for α if x∗x is integrable for α. Note that integrability of a right action is
with respect to the left Haar weight. Similarly we say that a left action β : N → L∞(H) ¯⊗ N is
integrable if the set

(cid:8)x ∈ N+ (id ⊗ hL)α(x) ∈ N+(cid:9)

(cid:8)x ∈ N+ (h ⊗ id)β(x) ∈ N+(cid:9)

4

PAWE L KASPRZAK, FATEMEH KHOSRAVI, AND PIOTR M. SO LTAN

is σ-weakly dense in N+.

Let us recall brieﬂy some of the results of [28]. If α : N → N ¯⊗ L∞(H) is an action of H on

N then choosing a n.s.f. weight θ on N one can deﬁne a weight eθ on N ⋊α H ([28, Deﬁnition 3.4
and following remarks]) such that the corresponding GNS Hilbert space is Hθ ⊗ L2(H). Let eJ be

the modular conjugation related to this weight. Then the canonical implementation of α is by
deﬁnition the unitary

Some of the major results of [28] are that

◮ U ∈ B(Hθ) ¯⊗ L∞(H),
◮ (id ⊗ ∆H)U = U12U13,
◮ for x ∈ N we have α(x) = U (x ⊗ 1)U ∗.

U = eJ(Jθ ⊗ bJ).

The last formula says that U implements the action α.

Finally let us introduce two more important classes of actions: an action α : N → N ¯⊗ L∞(H)
of a locally compact quantum group H on a von Neumann algebra N is ergodic if the condition
α(x) = x ⊗ 1 implies that x ∈ C1. The action α is free if the set

generates the von Neumann algebra L∞(H).

(cid:8)(ω ⊗ id)α(x) x ∈ N, ω ∈ N∗(cid:9)

2.3. Homomorphism of quantum groups. Let H and G be locally compact quantum groups.
The notion of a homomorphism from H to G can be described in one of three ways. More precisely
there are natural bijections between the following three sets

◮ the set of bicharacters from H to G, i.e. unitaries V ∈ L∞(bG) ¯⊗ L∞(H) such that

and (∆bG ⊗ id)V = V23V13,

(id ⊗ ∆H)V = V12V13

◮ the set of actions α : L∞(G) → L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H) such that

(∆G ⊗ id) ◦ α = (id ⊗ α) ◦ ∆G

(such actions are called right quantum group homomorphisms, cf. [19, Section 1]),

◮ the set of those π ∈ Mor(Cu

0(G), Cu

0(H)) which satisfy

∆u

H ◦ π = (π ⊗ π) ◦ ∆u

G

(such morphisms are referred to as Hopf ∗-homomorphisms).

Each element of either of the three sets described above represents a homomorphism from H to G.
Thus from now on we will write Π : H → G to denote a homomorphism from H to G and freely use

its three “incarnations”, namely a bicharacter V ∈ L∞(bG) ¯⊗ L∞(H), a right quantum group homo-

morphism α : L∞(G) → L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H) and a Hopf ∗-homomorphism π ∈ Mor(Cu
The relationships between V , α and π representing the same Π are

0(G), Cu

0(H)).

V =(cid:0)id ⊗ (ΛH ◦ π)(cid:1)W G,

α ◦ ΛG = (ΛG ⊗ ΛH) ◦ (id ⊗ π) ◦ ∆u
G

and

α(x) = V (x ⊗ 1)V ∗,

x ∈ L∞(G).

(2.2)

2.4. Closed quantum subgroups and open quantum subgroups. Let G and H be locally
compact quantum groups. Following [29, Deﬁnition 2.5] (cf. [4] and the discussion therein) we
say that a homomorphism of quantum groups Π : H → G identiﬁes H with a closed quantum

subgroup of G if there exists an injective normal ∗-homomorphism γ : L∞(bH) → L∞(bG) such that

the corresponding bicharacter V is given by (γ ⊗ id)WH. Equivalently one can only demand that
γ satisfy ∆bG ◦ γ = (γ ⊗ γ) ◦ ∆bH ([4, Theorem 3.3]).

It follows from [16, Proposition 5.45] that if H is a closed subgroup of G then the image of

L∞(bH) under the injection γ is a Baaj-Vaes subalgebra of L∞(bG). In particular this shows that
there is a bijection between closed quantum subgroups of G and Baaj-Vaes subalgebras of L∞(bG).

INTEGRABLE ACTIONS AND QUANTUM SUBGROUPS

Now let G and H be locally compact quantum groups. According to [9, Deﬁnition 2.2] we
say that H is an open quantum subgroup of G if there is a surjective normal ∗-homomorphism
Θ : L∞(G) → L∞(H) such that ∆H ◦ Θ = (Θ ⊗ Θ) ◦ ∆G. In this case the algebra L∞(H) can be
identiﬁed with a corner of L∞(G) deﬁned by the central support of Θ which we denote by the
symbol 1H. Let us denote the map L∞(H) → 1H L∞(G) ⊂ L∞(G) by ι. The composition ι ◦ Θ is
the conditional expectation

L∞(G) ∋ x 7−→ 1Hx ∈ L∞(G).

By [9, Theorem 3.6] an open quantum subgroup of G is a closed quantum subgroup of G. In

fact the corresponding bicharacter V is (id ⊗ Θ)WG (cf. [9, Remark 3.7]) and the image of L∞(bH)
in L∞(bG) under the corresponding injection is the σ-weak closure of
(cid:8)(id ⊗ ω)(id ⊗ Θ)WG ω ∈ B(L2(H))∗(cid:9).

3. Integrable ergodic actions and open quantum subgroups

In this section we will prove a result on integrability of an action (Proposition 3.2) which will
enable us to give a characterization of open subgroups in terms of existence of certain integrable
elements (Theorem 3.3). This result will in turn become useful in Section 6.

The following lemma is a generalization of [16, Lemma 6.4], cf. also [19, Theorem 2.1]. The

technique of proof is virtually identical to that of proof of [16, Lemma 6.4].

Lemma 3.1. Let α : N → N ¯⊗ L∞(G) be an ergodic action of a locally compact quantum group G
on a von Neumann algebra N. If P ∈ N is a projection such that α(P ) ≤ P ⊗ 1 then P = 0 or
P = 1.

Proof. Since α is an injective map, N can be embedded into N ¯⊗ L∞(G) via this mapping. Viewing
α as this embedding we shall denote it by ι. Using this notation we have

(id ⊗ ∆G) ◦ ι = (id ⊗ ∆G) ◦ α = (α ⊗ id) ◦ α = (ι ⊗ id) ⊗ α

which shows that under the identiﬁcation of N with ι(N) the action α is given by id ⊗ ∆G. In
particular, as α is ergodic, id ⊗ ∆G is ergodic on ι(N). Therefore it is enough to prove the lemma

for (id ⊗ ∆G)(cid:12)(cid:12)ι(N).

Denote ι(P ) by Q. The condition that

(id ⊗ ∆G)(Q) ≤ Q ⊗ 1

means (id ⊗ ∆G)(Q)Q12 = (id ⊗ ∆G)(Q) or

PAWE L KASPRZAK, FATEMEH KHOSRAVI, AND PIOTR M. SO LTAN

Combining (3.1) and (3.4) we ﬁnd that (id ⊗ ∆G)(Q) = Q ⊗ 1, which by ergodicity of (id ⊗ ∆G)
(cid:3)

on N implies that Q = 0 or Q = 1.

The next proposition is very similar to [15, Proposition 6.2]. The diﬀerence is that the action
considered in [15] is the action of a closed quantum subgroup on the ambient quantum group. In
particular it is not ergodic, but has a particularly simple form.

Proposition 3.2. Let α : N → N ¯⊗ L∞(G) be an ergodic action of a locally compact quantum
group G on a von Neumann algebra N+. Then α is integrable if and only if there exists a non-zero
x ∈ N integrable for α.

Proof. Clearly if α is integrable then there are plenty of integrable elements. Assume now that
there exists a non-zero integrable element.

σ-weak closure J is a principal left ideal, i.e. there exists a non-zero projection P ∈ N such that
J = NP .

Let J = (cid:8)x ∈ N x∗x is integrable for α(cid:9). Then J is a non-zero left ideal in N and so its
2(cid:1).
Let x ∈ N+ be integrable for α. Let δ be the modular element for G and let ξ ∈ Dom(cid:0)δ 1

Consider ω ∈ L1(G)+ given by ω(y) = hξ yξi for all y ∈ L∞(G). Using right δ-invariance of hL
we get

and thus it follows that for any y ∈ J we have (id⊗ω)α(y) ∈ J . By continuity for any y ∈ J we have
(id ⊗ ω)α(y) ∈ J. In particular (id ⊗ ω)α(P ) ∈ J and consequently (id ⊗ ω)α(P ) = (id ⊗ ω)α(P )P .
As this is true for separating set of functionals ω, we conclude that α(P )(P ⊗1) = α(P ), i.e. α(P ) ≤
P ⊗ 1. By lemma 3.1 P = 1, so J is σ-weakly dense in N.
(cid:3)

Proposition 3.2 has its obvious analog for left actions (cf. Section 2.2).
Now let G and H be locally compact quantum groups and assume that H is an open subgroup
of G. As mentioned in Section 2.4 H is then also a closed quantum subgroup and the image of

L∞(bH) in L∞(bG) under the corresponding embedding is the σ-weak closure of

(cid:8)(id ⊗ ω)(id ⊗ Θ)WG ω ∈ B(L2(H))∗(cid:9),

where Θ : L∞(G) → L∞(H) is the surjection corresponding to the embedding H ⊂ G.

(3.5)

Let ι : L∞(H) ֒→ L∞(G) be the (non-unital) embedding as in Section 2.4. Now take ω in (3.5)

to be of the form ϑ ◦ ι, where ϑ ∈ B(L2(G))∗. Then

(id ⊗ ω)(cid:0)(id ⊗ Θ)(WG)(cid:1) = (id ⊗ ϑ)(cid:0)(1 ⊗ 1H)WG(cid:1) = (id ⊗ ϑ1H)WG,

where 1H is the central support of Θ and ϑ1H denotes the functional x 7→ ϑ(1Hx).

Now assume that ϑ is a L2-bounded functional on L∞(G). This means that there exists a vector

ξϑ ∈ L2(G) such that

ϑ(x) = hξϑ η(x)i

for all x ∈ Dom(η). It is easy to see that for any c ∈ L∞(G) the functional ϑc is still L2-bounded:

(ϑc)(x) = ϑ(cx) = hξϑ η(cx)i = hξϑ cη(x)i = hc∗ξϑ η(x)i

for all x ∈ Dom(η). It is known ([18, Section 6]) that the set of L2-bounded functionals is norm
dense in L1(G).

Theorem 3.3. Let H be a closed quantum subgroup of G via γ : L∞(bH) ֒→ L∞(bG). Then H is
open in G if and only if there exists a non-zero element x ∈ L∞(bH) such that γ(x) is square-
integrable with respect to the right Haar measure of bG.

INTEGRABLE ACTIONS AND QUANTUM SUBGROUPS

Proof. We can identify L∞(bH) with its image under γ, so L∞(bH) ⊂ L∞(bG). Assume that x ∈
L∞(bH) is non-zero and square integrable for bh. The map ∆bG restricted to L∞(bH) can be viewed
as an ergodic left action α of bG on bH:

β = ∆bG(cid:12)(cid:12)L∞( bH) : L∞(bH) −→ L∞(bG) ¯⊗ L∞(bH)

and the element x∗x is non-zero and integrable for β. By a left analog of Proposition 3.2 β is

guarantees that H is open.

Assume now that H is open. From the discussion preceding the statement of the theorem we

integrable, and by right invariance, bh restricted to L∞(bH) is semiﬁnite. Now [9, Theorem 7.5]
know that the image of L∞(bH) in L∞(bG) is the closure of the set
(cid:8)(id ⊗ ϑ1H)WG ϑ ∈ L1(G)(cid:9).

Since the set of L2-bounded functionals is dense in L1(G), there must exist an L2-bounded ϑ
such that x = (id ⊗ ϑ1H)WG is non-zero. Moreover, we also know that ϑ1H is L2-bounded, so
(cid:3)

Proof. This has practically been proved in Theorem 3.3. To make things more precise, we note

on L∞(bG). Then H is open in G if and only if the right Haar measure of bH is proportional to
bh ◦ γ.
that the condition that the Haar weight on L∞(bH) is proportional to bh ◦ γ is equivalent to bh ◦ γ
being semiﬁnite on L∞(bH). Thus if bh ◦ γ is semiﬁnite then H is open in G by Theorem 3.3.
Conversely if H is open in G then Theorem 3.3 says that there is a non-zero element of γ(cid:0)L∞(bH)(cid:1)
integrable for bh. By right invariance this element is integrable for the ergodic action of bG on
γ(cid:0)L∞(bH)(cid:1) given by ∆bH. Thus by the left analog of Proposition 3.2 this action is integrable, which
again by right invariance means that bh ◦ γ is semiﬁnite.

In terms of integrability of actions the characterization of open quantum subgroups is given by

(cid:3)

the following corollary:

Corollary 3.5. Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups and let H be a closed subgroup

of G with corresponding injection γ : L∞(bH) ֒→ L∞(bG). Then H is open in G if and only if the
left action of bG on γ(cid:0)L∞(bH)(cid:1) given by ∆bG is integrable.

4. Image and kernel of a homomorphism

Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups throughout this section we will be focused

on a homomorphism Π : H → G with corresponding bicharacter V ∈ L∞(bG) ¯⊗ L∞(H) and a

right quantum group homomorphism α : L∞(G) → L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H). We will introduce a closed
quantum subgroup of G and a “quotient” quantum group of H which correspond to the closure of
the image and quotient by the kernel of Π.

4.1. Closure of image of Π. The next proposition is a slightly stronger version of [9, Lemma
1.2].

Proposition 4.1. Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups and let Π : H → G be a

homomorphism of quantum groups with corresponding bicharacter V ∈ L∞(bG) ¯⊗ L∞(H). Let
Then L is a Baaj-Vaes subalgebra of L∞(bG).

Proof. First we note that L is a von Neumann algebra.
Indeed this follows directly from [35,
Theorem 1.6(1)]. To check that L is an invariant subalgebra it is enough to see that for any

ζ ∈ L1(H) and any φ ∈ L1(bG) we have

This we infer from the fact that

(id ⊗ φ)(cid:0)∆bG(cid:0)(id ⊗ ζ)V(cid:1)(cid:1), (φ ⊗ id)(cid:0)∆bG(cid:0)(id ⊗ ζ)V(cid:1)(cid:1) ∈ L.
(id ⊗ φ)(cid:0)∆bG(cid:0)(id ⊗ ζ)V(cid:1)(cid:1) = (id ⊗ φ ⊗ ζ)(V23V13) = (id ⊗ eφ)V,
(φ ⊗ id)(cid:0)∆bG(cid:0)(id ⊗ ζ)V(cid:1)(cid:1) = (φ ⊗ id ⊗ ζ)(V23V13) = (id ⊗ ˘φ)V,

where eφ(y) = (φ ⊗ ζ)(cid:0)V (1 ⊗ y)(cid:1) for all y ∈ L∞(H). Similarly
with ˘φ(y) = (φ ⊗ ζ)(cid:0)(1 ⊗ y)V(cid:1) for all y ∈ L∞(H).

(cid:3)

As mentioned in Section 2.4, a Baaj-Vaes subalgebra L of L∞(bG) deﬁnes a quantum subgroup
K of G by setting bK to be the quantum group associated with L. Thus, using Proposition 4.1 we

can introduce the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 4.2. Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups and let Π : H → G be a
homomorphism of quantum groups. We deﬁne the closed quantum subgroup im Π of G as the

quantum subgroup related to the Baaj-Vaes subalgebra L of L∞(bG) described in Proposition 4.1.

In particular

L∞(cid:0)[

im Π(cid:1) =(cid:8)(id ⊗ ζ)V ζ ∈ L1(H)(cid:9)σ−weak closure

.

4.2. Quotient by kernel of Π. In a manner completely analogous to the one used in the proof
of Proposition 4.1 we obtain also the following result:

Proposition 4.3. Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups and let Π : H → G be a

homomorphism of quantum groups with corresponding bicharacter V ∈ L∞(bG) ¯⊗ L∞(H). Let

R =(cid:8)(φ ⊗ id)V φ ∈ L1(bG)(cid:9)σ−weak closure

.

Then R is a Baaj-Vaes subalgebra of L∞(H).

Deﬁnition 4.4. Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups. Given a homomorphism

group H/ker Π by setting

Π : H → G described by a bicharacter V ∈ L∞(bG) ¯⊗ L∞(H) we deﬁne a locally compact quantum
and ∆H/ker Π = ∆H(cid:12)(cid:12)L∞(H/ker Π).

L∞(H/ker Π) =(cid:8)(φ ⊗ id)V φ ∈ L1(bG)(cid:9)σ−weak closure

Given G, H and Π as in Deﬁnition 4.4 it may happen that the subalgebra L∞(H/ker Π) is all
of L∞(H). In this case we say that H/ker Π = H. Using this language we can rewrite implication
(1) ⇒ (3) of [4, Theorem 3.4] in the following way:

Corollary 4.5. Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups and let Π : H → G be a homo-
morphism of quantum groups. If Π identiﬁes H with a closed subgroup of G then H/ker Π = H.

Remark 4.6. If G and H are locally compact groups and Π : H → G is a continuous homomor-
phism then it is not diﬃcult to see that Deﬁnitions 4.2 and 4.4 yield quantum groups corresponding
to the closure of the image of Π and kernel of Π respectively.

4.3. Quotient by kernel of a quantum group action. Let G and H be locally compact
quantum groups. A homomorphism of quantum groups Π : H → G deﬁnes the quantum group
H/ker Π as in Deﬁnition 4.4. The next theorem shows that this quantum group can be deﬁned
directly from the action α : L∞(G) → L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H) associated to Π.

Theorem 4.7. Let H and G be locally compact quantum groups and let Π : H → G be a homomor-

phism of quantum groups with corresponding bicharacter V ∈ L∞(bG) ¯⊗ L∞(H) and right quantum

group homomorphism α : L∞(G) → L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H). Then

(cid:8)(ω ⊗ id)α(x) x ∈ L∞(G), ω ∈ L1(G)(cid:9)′′

= L∞(H/ker Π).

(4.1)

Proof. Let us denote by M the left hand side of (4.1) and let R be a shorthand for L∞(H/ker Π).
Clearly M is a von Neumann algebra. The next thing to see is that M ⊂ L∞(H) is a left coideal.
To check this take x ∈ L∞(G), ω ∈ L1(G) and ζ ∈ L1(H). We have

(ζ ⊗ id)∆H(cid:0)(ω ⊗ id)α(x)(cid:1) =(cid:0)(cid:2)(ω ⊗ ζ) ◦ α(cid:3) ⊗ id(cid:1)α(x) ∈ M,

so ∆H(cid:0)M(cid:1) ⊂ L∞(H) ¯⊗ M.
Once we know that M is a left coideal in L∞(G), we can consider its co-dual eM (cf. the end of
The co-dual of M consists of those y ∈ L∞(bH) which satisfy uy = yu for all u ∈ M. Thus y ∈ eM

Section 2.1 and [12, Section 3]).

if and only if

V (x ⊗ 1)V ∗(1 ⊗ y) = (1 ⊗ y)V (x ⊗ 1)V ∗,

x ∈ L∞(G)

or, equivalently,

V ∗(1 ⊗ y)V (x ⊗ 1) = (x ⊗ 1)V ∗(1 ⊗ y)V,

x ∈ L∞(G).

This means that V ∗(1 ⊗ y)V ∈ L∞(G)′ ¯⊗ B(L2(H)), but at the same time V ∗(1 ⊗ y)V ∈

L∞(bG) ¯⊗ B(L2(H)). Since L∞(bG) ∩ L∞(G)′ = C1 (this is [18, Proposition 4.7(3)] applied to
bG), we ﬁnd that V ∗(1 ⊗ y)V = 1 ⊗ z for some z ∈ B(L2(H)). This is equivalent to

(1 ⊗ y)V = V (1 ⊗ z)

and slicing the left leg of this equality yields

yu = uz,

u ∈ R.

Since 1 ∈ R, we conclude that y = z, so for y to belong to eM is equivalent to y ∈ L∞(bH) ∩ R′ = eR.
In other words eM = eR and so M = eeM = eeR = R.

In analogy with the way L∞(H/ker Π) is deﬁned in terms of the action of H on G given by the
homomorphism Π in Theorem 4.7 we can deﬁne a similar object for an arbitrary action α of H on
a von Neumann algebra M.

Proposition 4.8. Let M be a von Neumann algebra and let H be a locally compact quantum group.

Let α : M → M ¯⊗ L∞(H) be an action of H on M. Let N0 = (cid:8)(ω ⊗ id)α(x) ω ∈ M∗, x ∈ M(cid:9)′′

Then N0 is an invariant subalgebra of L∞(H).

Proof. The proof is completely analogous to the ﬁrst stage of the proof of Theorem 4.7.

(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 4.9. Let M be a von Neumann algebra and let H be a locally compact quantum group.
Let α : M → M ¯⊗ L∞(H) be an action of H on M. Let N be the smallest Baaj-Vaes subalgebra of
L∞(H) containing the set

We deﬁne the quantum group H/ker α as the locally compact quantum group such that

(cid:8)(ω ⊗ id)α(x) ω ∈ M∗, x ∈ M(cid:9).

and ∆H/ker α = ∆H(cid:12)(cid:12)L∞(H/ker α).

(1) Theorem 4.7 makes it clear that if H and G are locally compact quantum groups and
Π : H → G is a homomorphism of quantum groups with associated right quantum group
morphism (action) α : L∞(G) → L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H) then H/ker α coincides with H/ker Π.
(2) The quantum group of inner automorphisms of a locally compact quantum group deﬁned
in [11, Deﬁnition 3.3] is a special case of the group of the form H/ker α for a certain action
α.

(3) If H is a locally compact group acting on a von Neumann algebra N with corresponding
“quantum action” α : N → N ¯⊗ L∞(H) then the quantum group H/ker α deﬁned in Def-
inition 4.9 corresponds to the quotient of H by the subgroup of all elements which act
trivially on N (cf. Remark 4.6).

The next result shows that if an action α : N → N ¯⊗ L∞(H) of a locally compact quantum group
H on a von Neumann algebra N is integrable, the kernel of α is in some sense small, or rather
compact (cf. [9, Theorem 7.2]).

Proposition 4.11. Let N be a von Neumann algebra and let H be a locally compact quantum
group. Let α : N → N ¯⊗ L∞(H) be an action of H on N. Assume that α is integrable. Then

of N we then have

Proof. Since α is integrable, there exists x ∈ N+ such that (id ⊗ hL)α(x) ∈ N+ and there is a

Thus the element R(cid:0)(cid:0)(ω ⊗ id)α(x)(cid:1) 1
respect to h, so by Theorem 3.3, \H/ker α is an open subgroup of bH.

5. Canonical implementation of right quantum group homomorphism

(cid:3)

In this section we address the problem of determining the canonical implementation ([28] and
Section 2.2) of the action associated to a homomorphism of quantum groups. Let G and H be
locally compact quantum groups and let Π : H → G be a homomorphism of quantum groups. Let
α : L∞(G) → L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H) be the corresponding action of H. In order to deﬁne the canonical
implementation of α one must choose a n.s.f. weight on L∞(G). We choose for this the right Haar
weight h of G.

A way to determine the canonical implementation is then provided by the proof of [28, Propo-
sition 4.3]. In this proposition S. Vaes proves that in case the chosen weight is δ−1-invariant (see
[6, D´eﬁnition 2.7], [28, Deﬁnition 2.3]) the unitary implementation U coincides with a unitary Vθ
deﬁned in [28, Proposition 2.4] (cf. [6, Th´eor`eme 2.9]). A careful examination of the proof of [28,
Proposition 4.3] shows that the claim is established on the basis of several properties of Vθ listed
in [28, Proposition 2.4]. In particular δ−1-invariance of the chosen weight does not play a crucial
role.

In our situation we choose an invariant weight, so [28, Proposition 4.3] is not applicable directly.
Nevertheless we already know that the action α : L∞(G) → L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H) is implemented by
the corresponding bicharacter (see (2.2)). Moreover V has the following properties:

◮ (cid:0)J G ⊗ J
◮ (cid:0)∇G ⊗ ∇
◮ for any ω ∈ L1(H) and any x ∈ Dom(η) we have(cid:0)(id ⊗ ω)V(cid:1)η(x) = η(cid:0)(id ⊗ ω)α(x)(cid:1), where

bH(cid:1)V = V ∗(cid:0)J G ⊗ J
bH(cid:1),
bH(cid:1)V = V(cid:0)∇G ⊗ ∇
bH(cid:1),

η is the GNS map for the right Haar weight of G.

bG ⊗ τ H which
The ﬁrst two properties are consequences of invariance of V under R
we already used in the proof of Proposition 4.1 (cf. [17, Proposition 2.1]). The last property
follows from (7.1) and Proposition 7.4 from the Appendix.
Indeed, using notation introduced
at the beginning of Section 7.2, for ω ∈ L1(H) we set µ = ω ◦ ΛH ◦ π, where π is the Hopf
∗-homomorphism corresponding to Π and ΛH is the reducing morphism for H. Then by (7.1)

bG ⊗ RH and τ

µ ∗ x = (id ⊗ µ)(cid:0)W G(x ⊗ 1)W G∗(cid:1) = (id ⊗ ω)(cid:0)V (x ⊗ 1)V ∗(cid:1) = (id ⊗ ω)(cid:0)α(x)(cid:1)

INTEGRABLE ACTIONS AND QUANTUM SUBGROUPS

(because (cid:0)id ⊗ (ΛH ◦ π)(cid:1)WG = V ) and

by Proposition 7.4.

(cid:0)(id ⊗ ω)V(cid:1)η(x) =(cid:0)(id ⊗ µ)W G(cid:1)η(x) = η(µ ∗ x)

Repeating the steps of [28, Proposition 4.3] with 1 instead of δ−1 we obtain the following:

Theorem 5.1. Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups and let Π : H → G be a homomor-

phisms of quantum groups with corresponding bicharacter V ∈ L∞(bG) ¯⊗ L∞(H) and right quantum

group homomorphism α : L∞(G) → L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H). Then V is the canonical implementation of
α.

Let us also remark that Theorem 5.1 was actually stated and used already in [5, Proof of

Proposition 3.12].

We are now ready to use [28, Theorem 5.3] which characterizes integrability of actions in the
following terms: let α : N → N ¯⊗ L∞(H) be an action of a locally compact quantum group H on a
von Neumann algebra N. Choose a n.s.f. weight θ on N and identify N with its image in B(Hθ).
Furthermore let U ∈ B(Hθ) ¯⊗ L∞(H) be the canonical implementation of α and let N2 be the von
Neumann algebra

Now [28, Theorem 5.3] says that α is integrable if and only if there exists a normal surjective
∗-homomorphism ρ : N ⋊α H → N2 such that

N2 =(cid:0)N ∪(cid:8)(id ⊗ ω)U ω ∈ L1(H)(cid:9)(cid:1)′′

.

◮ ρ(cid:0)α(x)(cid:1) = x for all x ∈ N,
◮ ρ(cid:0)1 ⊗ [(id ⊗ ω)WH](cid:1) = (id ⊗ ω)U for all ω ∈ L1(H).

6. Integrability and quantum subgroups

In this section we will study homomorphisms of quantum groups with the property that the as-
sociated action is integrable. The ﬁrst consequence will be that the kernel of such a homomorphism
is in some sense small and the other that the quotient by the kernel can be canonically identiﬁed
with the closure of the image. To make this more precise let Π : H → G be a homomorphism of

quantum groups with associated bicharacter V ∈ L∞(bG) ¯⊗ L∞(H). We will say that H/ker Π can
be canonically identiﬁed with im Π if there exists an isomorphism χ : L∞(cid:0)im Π(cid:1) → L∞(H/ker Π)

such that

(id ⊗ χ)(Wim Π) = V.

(6.1)

Note that indeed the right leg of V belongs to L∞(H/ker Π), in fact we have

We will write simply H/ker Π ∼= im Π to denote this situation. This will not lead to confusion, as
an isomorphism χ satisfying (6.1) is necessarily unique.

V ∈ L∞(cid:0)[

im Π(cid:1) ¯⊗ L∞(H/ker Π).

Theorem 6.1. Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups and let Π : H → G be a homomor-
phism of quantum groups. Assume that the corresponding right quantum group homomorphism α
is integrable. Then

(1) \H/ker Π is an open subgroup of bH,

(2) H/ker Π ∼= im Π.

Proof. Ad (1). This follows from Proposition 4.11 and Remark 4.10(2).

Ad (2). Let us denote L∞(G) by N, thus α : N → N ¯⊗ L∞(H) and let us, as usual, denote by V
the bicharacter corresponding to Π. The assumption of integrability means that, by [28, Theorem
5.3] and Theorem 5.1, we have a normal surjective ∗-homomorphism ρ : N ⋊α H → N2, where N2

is the von Neumann algebra generated by N and (cid:8)(id ⊗ ω)V ω ∈ L1(H)(cid:9) such that

◮ ρ(cid:0)α(x)(cid:1) = x for all x ∈ N,
◮ ρ(cid:0)1 ⊗ [(id ⊗ ω)WH](cid:1) = (id ⊗ ω)V for all ω ∈ L1(H).

Let eρ denote the map L∞(bH) ∋ y 7→ ρ(1 ⊗ y) ∈ N2. By the second point above and the deﬁnition
of im Π the map eρ has image L∞(cid:0)[

im Π is an open subgroup of bH and, as open subgroups are closed, there exists a unital injective

Theorem 6.2. Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups and let H be a closed quantum
subgroup of G with right quantum group homomorphism α : L∞(G) → L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H) corre-
sponding to the embedding H ֒→ G. Then α is integrable.

As in the proof of Theorem 6.1, we will use the criterion of integrability from [28] mentioned at
the end of Section 5. We will in fact show that if H is a closed subgroup of G and we write N for the
algebra L∞(G) then the algebras N ⋊α H and N2 are isomorphic with the isomorphism satisfying
the requirements of [28, Theorem 5.3]. Theorem 6.2 was proved in [5] by the same technique.

Proof of Theorem 6.2. Let us begin with the remark that if Y = (J ⊗ J)W

bG(J ⊗ J) then Y ∈

Y (u ⊗ 1)Y ∗ = ∆bGop (u),

L∞(G)′ ¯⊗ L∞(bG) and Y implements the opposite comultiplication on L∞(bG):
Indeed, writing bR for the unitary antipode of bG we have
bG(cid:0)bR(u∗) ⊗ 1(cid:1)W
= (J ⊗ J)∆bG(cid:0)bR(u∗)(cid:1)(J ⊗ J)
= (J ⊗ J)(bR ⊗ bR)(cid:0)∆bGop (u∗)(cid:1)(J ⊗ J) = ∆bGop (u).

u ∈ L∞(bG).

Let us write N for the algebra L∞(G). We can now deﬁne a map from N ⋊α H to the algebra N2

Recall that since H is a closed subgroup of G, we have a normal injective unital ∗-homomorphism

which is the von Neumann algebra generated inside B(L2(G)) by N and (cid:8)(id ⊗ ω)V ω ∈ L1(H)(cid:9).
γ : L∞(bH) ֒→ L∞(bG) such that

(γ ⊗ id)WH = V.

For a ∈ N ⋊α H we will consider the element

Y ∗(cid:2)(id ⊗ γ)(V ∗aV )(cid:3)Y.

(6.3)
It is not immediately clear that V ∗aV belongs to the domain of id ⊗ γ, but it follows from the
following computation. We know that elements of the form α(x)(1 ⊗ y) = V (x ⊗ 1)V ∗(1 ⊗ y)

with x ∈ N and y ∈ L∞(bH) span a dense subspace in N ⋊α H ([13, Proposition 2.3]). Taking

a = V (x ⊗ 1)V ∗(1 ⊗ y) in (6.3) yields

Y ∗(cid:2)(id ⊗ γ)(cid:0)(x ⊗ 1)V ∗(1 ⊗ y)V(cid:1)(cid:3)Y = Y ∗(cid:2)(cid:0)(x ⊗ 1)(γ ⊗ γ)(cid:0)WH∗
= Y ∗(cid:2)(x ⊗ 1)(γ ⊗ γ)(cid:0)∆bHop (y)(cid:1)(cid:3)Y
= Y ∗(cid:2)(x ⊗ 1)∆bGop(cid:0)γ(y)(cid:1)(cid:3)Y
= Y ∗(cid:2)(x ⊗ 1)Y(cid:0)γ(y) ⊗ 1(cid:1)Y ∗(cid:3)Y
= Y ∗(cid:2)Y (x ⊗ 1)(cid:0)γ(y) ⊗ 1(cid:1)Y ∗(cid:3)Y
= (x ⊗ 1)(cid:0)γ(y) ⊗ 1(cid:1) = xγ(y) ⊗ 1.

(1 ⊗ y)WH(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:3)Y

Thus there exists a normal injective unital ∗-homomorphism ρ : N ⋊α H → N2 such that

In particular

ρ(cid:0)α(x)(1 ⊗ y)(cid:1) = xγ(y),

x ∈ N, y ∈ L∞(bH).

◮ ρ(cid:0)α(x)(cid:1) = x for x ∈ N,
◮ ρ(cid:0)1 ⊗ [(id ⊗ ω)WH](cid:1) = (id ⊗ ω)V for ω ∈ L1(H).

Clearly N and γ(cid:0)L∞(bH)(cid:1) are both contained in the range of ρ, so ρ must be surjective.

Theorem 6.3. Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups and let Π : H → G be a homomor-
phism of quantum groups with corresponding right quantum group homomorphism α : L∞(G) →
L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H). Assume that

(1) \H/ker Π is an open subgroup of bH,

(2) H/ker Π ∼= im Π.

Then α is integrable.

Proof. As we already noticed in the ﬁrst part of the proof of Theorem 6.1, the image of α is

contained in L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H/ker Π). Now let χ : L∞(cid:0)im Π(cid:1) → L∞(H/ker Π) be as in (6.1) and
let eα = (id ⊗ χ−1) ◦ α. Then eα is an action of im Π on L∞(G) implemented by the bicharacter
(id ⊗ χ−1)V ∈ L∞(bG) ¯⊗ L∞(cid:0)im Π(cid:1). But we know that im Π is a closed subgroup of G via the
corresponding homomorphism of quantum groups, so by Theorem 6.2 the action eα is integrable.

To conclude that α is integrable we note that due to assumption (1) the Haar measure of H/ker Π
is (proportional to) the restriction of the Haar measure of H to L∞(H/ker Π) by Corollary 3.4. (cid:3)

Remark 6.4. Theorems 6.1 and 6.3 provide the following characterization of those homomor-
phisms of quantum groups Π : H → G for which the corresponding right quantum group homo-
morphism α : L∞(G) → L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H) is an integrable action: α is integrable if and only if the
conditions (1) and (2) from Theorem 6.1 hold.

Corollary 6.5. Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups and let Π : H → G be a homomor-
phism of quantum groups with corresponding right quantum group homomorphism α : L∞(G) →
L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H). Assume that α is integrable and free. Then Π identiﬁes H with a closed quantum
subgroup of G.

is all of L∞(H). In
view of Theorem 4.7, this means that L∞(H/ker Π) = L∞(H) (cf. discussion after Deﬁnition 4.4).
Since α is assumed to be integrable, by Theorem 6.1(2), we have H/ker Π ∼= im Π in the sense that

Proof. The freeness of α means that (cid:8)(ω ⊗ id)α(x) x ∈ L∞(G), ω ∈ L1(G)(cid:9)′′

Thus χ can be regarded as an isomorphism L∞(cid:0)im Π(cid:1) → L∞(H) with the property (6.4). Let
im Π(cid:1) such that (bχ ⊗ id)WH =
bχ be the dual of χ. Then bχ is an isomorphism L∞(bH) → L∞(cid:0)[
where bχ is a normal, unital injective ∗-homomorphism. It follows that the bicharacter V identiﬁes

V = (bχ ⊗ id)WH,

H with a closed quantum subgroup of G.

(cid:3)

We now turn our attention to quantum subgroups closed in the sense of Woronowicz ([4, Def-
inition 3.2]). Let us recall that if H and G are locally compact quantum groups and Π : H → G
identiﬁes H with a closed quantum subgroup of G in the sense of Woronowicz if the bicharacter
V associated with Π generates the C∗-algebra C0(H). One of the equivalent formulations of this
condition is that

(cid:3)

is norm dense in C0(H) ([4, Theorem 3.6]). In particular it is then σ-weakly dense in L∞(H). In
what follows we will use the phrase “Woronowicz-closed quantum subgroup” instead of “closed
quantum subgroup in the sense of Woronowicz” in order to make the statements more transparent.

Corollary 6.6. Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups and let Π : H → G be a homo-
morphism of quantum groups which identiﬁes H with a Woronowicz-closed quantum subgroup of
G. If the corresponding right quantum group homomorphism α : L∞(G) → L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H) is
integrable then Π identiﬁes H with a closed quantum subgroup of G.

Proof. It is clear from the remark preceding the corollary that if H is a Woronowicz-closed quantum
subgroup of G then α is free. As it is assumed to be integrable, the fact that it is a closed quantum
subgroup as deﬁned in Section 2.4 follows from Corollary 6.5.
(cid:3)

Remark 6.7.

(1) Corollary 6.6 together with Theorem 6.2 show that closed quantum subgroups are pre-
cisely Woronowicz-closed quantum subgroups with integrable corresponding right quantum
group homomorphism.

(2) This gives as an easy consequence an immediate proof of [4, Theorem 6.1] as any action

of a compact quantum group is integrable.

(3) Finally, Corollary 6.6 is really a characterization of those homomorphisms of quantum
groups Π : H → G which identify H with a closed quantum subgroup of G. Indeed, if H is
a closed quantum subgroup then the action corresponding to Π is free (because a closed
quantum subgroup of G is a Woronowicz-closed quantum subgroup of G, [4, Theorem 3.5])
and it is integrable by Theorem 6.2.

7. Appendix

7.1. Classical case. Let us discuss the results we obtained for locally compact quantum groups
in the special case when the groups involved are in fact classical.
In what follows the symbol
vN(K) will denote the (right) group von Neumann algebra of a locally compact group K.

Thus let G and H be locally compact groups and let Π : H → G be a continuous homomorphism.
The three equivalent descriptions of Π used when dealing with quantum groups take the following
form:

◮ the bicharacter V ∈ L∞(bG) ¯⊗ L∞(H) = vN(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H) ∼= L∞(H, vN(G)) is the repre-

sentation of H on L2(G) by right shifts along the image of Π:

◮ The action α : L∞(G) → L∞(G) ¯⊗ L∞(H) ∼= L∞(G × H) is the pull-back of the natural

right action of H on L∞(G) arising from Π:

so that for f ∈ L∞(G) the function α(f ) ∈ L∞(G × H) is α(f )(g, h) = f(cid:0)gΠ(h)(cid:1).

◮ The Hopf ∗-homomorphism π ∈ Mor(C0(G), C0(H)) is the pre-composition with Π:

g · h = gΠ(h),

g ∈ G, h ∈ H,

Let us ﬁx G, H and Π (so we also have V , α and π). We leave to the reader the veriﬁcation

π(f ) = f ◦ Π,

f ∈ C0(G).

(Vhψ)(g) = ψ(cid:0)gΠ(h)(cid:1),

ψ ∈ L2(G), g ∈ G, h ∈ H.

that

and

(cid:8)(id ⊗ ζ)V ζ ∈ L1(H)(cid:9)σ−weak closure
(cid:8)(φ ⊗ id)V φ ∈ vN(G)∗(cid:9)σ−weak closure

coincide respectively with vN(cid:0)im Π(cid:1) canonically embedded in vN(G) and L∞(H/ker Π) viewed as

a subalgebra of L∞(H) (functions constant on cosets of ker Π).

It is easy to see that the action α is integrable if and only if the set of positive f ∈ L∞(G) such

that the integral

Z

H

f(cid:0) · Π(h)(cid:1)dhL(h)

exists in L∞(G) is σ-weakly dense in L∞(G)+.

Rewriting the results of Section 6 for classical groups we ﬁnd the following:

INTEGRABLE ACTIONS AND QUANTUM SUBGROUPS

15

Theorem 7.1. Let G and H be locally compact groups and let Π : H → G be a continuous
homomorphism. Let α be the action of H on L∞(G) corresponding to Π. Then α is integrable if
and only if

(1) ker Π is compact,
(2) the image of Π is closed and H/ker Π is homeomorphic to im Π.

We leave the details to the reader, but let us only mention that condition (1) of Theorem 7.1 is

equivalent to \H/ker Π being an open quantum subgroup of bH by [9, Theorem 7.2]. In the special

case of an injective morphism we obtain the following corollary:

Corollary 7.2. Let G and H be locally compact groups and let Π : H → G be a continuous
injective homomorphism. Then the image of Π is closed and Π is a homeomorphism onto im Π if
and only if the associated action of H on L∞(G) is integrable.

7.2. Characterization of compact quantum subgroups. In this section we will present a
characterization of compact quantum subgroups somewhat analogous to that of open quantum
subgroups given in Theorem 3.3 (cf. also Corollary 7.5). To that end let us recall from [28,
Deﬁnition 4.1] (see also [12, Lemma 3.11]) that if H and G are locally compact quantum groups

homogeneous space G/H is described by the left coideal L∞(G/H) ⊂ L∞(G) deﬁned as the co-

and H is identiﬁed with a closed subgroup of G via γ : L∞(bH) ֒→ L∞(bG) then the measured
dual of γ(cid:0)L∞(bH)(cid:1) ⊂ L∞(bG) (see Section 2.1).

Theorem 7.3. Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups and let H be a closed quantum
subgroup of G. Then H is compact if and only if there exists a non-zero element x ∈ L∞(G/H)
which is square integrable with respect to the Haar measure of G.

For the proof of Theorem 7.3 we need a few results about convolutions. Let G be a locally
compact quantum group. Then we have Banach algebra structures on spaces of functionals like
L1(G) or Cu
0(G)∗. For the purposes of this section we will denote the (convolution) products on
these spaces respectively by ∗ and ∗ :

ω1 ∗ ω2 = (ω1 ⊗ ω2) ◦ ∆G,
µ1 ∗ µ2 = (µ1 ⊗ µ2) ◦ ∆u
G,

ω1, ω2 ∈ L1(G),
0(G)∗.
µ1, µ2 ∈ Cu

Moreover the adjoint of the reducing morphism ΛG : Cu

0(G)∗. The image of ι is a closed two sided ideal in Cu

0(G) ։ C0(G) ⊂ L∞(G) provides an
0(G)∗ ([14,

we obtain a bounded map L1(G) → L1(G). The adjoint of this map, denoted by L∞(G) ∋ x 7→
µ ∗ x ∈ L∞(G), is σ-weakly continuous and is in fact given by

ω 7−→ ι−1(cid:0)ι(ω) ∗ µ(cid:1)

µ ∗ x = (id ⊗ µ)(cid:0)WG(x ⊗ 1)W G∗(cid:1)

(7.1)

(this follows e.g. from [14, Proof of Proposition 5.3]). In particular for any ω ∈ L1(G) we have

where ω ∗ x is by deﬁnition (id ⊗ ω)∆G(x). Also it is not diﬃcult to check that

ι(ω) ∗ x = ω ∗ x,

ω ∗ (µ ∗ x) = Rµ(ω) ∗ x

(7.2)

for all ω ∈ L1(G), µ ∈ Cu

0(G)∗ and x ∈ L∞(G).

By [10, Lemma 3.4], for µ ∈ Cu

0(G)∗ and x ∈ L∞(G)+ we have

In particular, it follows from the Kadison inequality that if x ∈ L∞(G) is square integrable for h
and µ ∈ Cu

+ then µ ∗ x is also square integrable for h.

0(G)∗

h(µ ∗ x) = µ(1)h(x).

Proposition 7.4. Let G be a locally compact quantum group. Then for µ ∈ Cu
Dom(η)

0(G)∗ and x ∈

η(µ ∗ x) =(cid:0)(id ⊗ µ)(WG)(cid:1)η(x)

Proof. It is enough to prove this for positive µ because both sides of (7.3) are linear in this variable.
Take ω ∈ L1(G). Using [18, Proposition 1.10, formula (1.7)] and [18, Theorem 3.5, formula

(3.6)] we ﬁnd that on one hand

and on the other hand, by (7.2),

In order to analyze the operator (id ⊗ Rµω)(WG) we compute:

η(cid:0)(Rµω) ∗ x(cid:1) = (id ⊗ Rµω)(WG)η(x)

η(cid:0)(Rµω) ∗ x)(cid:1) = η(cid:0)ω ∗ (µ ∗ x)(cid:1) = (id ⊗ ω)(WG)η(µ ∗ x).
(id ⊗ Rµω)(WG) =(cid:0)id ⊗ ι−1(ι(ω) ∗ µ)(cid:1)WG

= (id ⊗ ω)(WG)(id ⊗ µ)(WG).

12

Comparing (7.4) and (7.5) we ﬁnd using (7.6) that

(id ⊗ ω)(WG)η(µ ∗ x) = (id ⊗ ω)(WG)(id ⊗ µ)(W G)η(x).

As operators of the form (id ⊗ ω)(WG) can strongly approximate the identity operator, we have
proved (7.3).
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 7.3. Assume ﬁrst that H is a closed quantum subgroup of G with a non-zero
x ∈ L∞(G/H) square integrable for h.

Thus we have a normal unital and injective ∗-homomorphism γ : L∞(bH) ֒→ L∞(bG), the cor-

responding bicharacter V = (γ ⊗ id)WH and the surjective Hopf ∗-homomorphism π : Cu
Cu

0(G) →

0(H) such that

V = (id ⊗ ΛH)(id ⊗ π)(W G).

Moreover L∞(bH) (now identiﬁed with a subalgebra of L∞(bG)) is the σ-weak closure of
For the purposes of this proof we will identify L∞(bH) with its image in L∞(bG) under γ.

(cid:8)(id ⊗ ω)V ω ∈ B(L2(H))∗(cid:9) =(cid:8)(id ⊗ ω)V ω ∈ L1(H)(cid:9).

Let P ∈ B(L2(G)) be the projection onto the one dimensional subspace spanned by η(x). We

will ﬁrst show that for any ω ∈ L1(H) and y = (id ⊗ ω)V we have

Indeed, let µ = ω ◦ ΛH ◦ π. Then y = (id ⊗ µ)WG, so

yP = ω(1)P.

yη(x) = (id ⊗ µ)WGη(x) = η(µ ∗ x)

by Proposition 7.4.

(7.7)

(7.8)

Now x ∈ L∞(G/H) = L∞(bH)′ ∩ L∞(G), so

µ ∗ x = (id ⊗ µ)(cid:0)WG(x ⊗ 1)W G∗(cid:1)

= (id ⊗ ω)(cid:0)V (x ⊗ 1)V ∗(cid:1)

= (id ⊗ ω)(x ⊗ 1) = ω(1)x,

which in view of (7.8) proves (7.7).

INTEGRABLE ACTIONS AND QUANTUM SUBGROUPS

17

Equality (7.7) for all ω shows that for any y ∈ L∞(bH) the operator yP is proportional to P .
Thus we can deﬁne a σ-weakly continuous functional bε : L∞(bH) → C by
yP = bε(y)P
(it is not diﬃcult to check that bε is in fact a ∗-homomorphism and, in particular, a state).
For y = (id ⊗ ω)V we get bε(y) = ω(1) or, in other words
(bε ⊗ ω)V = ω(1).
(bε ⊗ id)V = 1.

It follows that 1 belongs to C0(H), so H is compact.

Assume now that H is a compact subgroup of G. In [22, Theorem 5.1] a conditional expectation
0(G/H) was deﬁned (see [12, Example 5.3(2)]), but in fact the arguments used there
0(G) → Cu
Cu
show that we also have the conditional expectation on the reduced level: E : C0(G) → C0(G/H)

As this holds for all ω, we ﬁnd that

E(a) = (id ⊗ hH)(cid:0)V (a ⊗ 1)V ∗(cid:1)

where hH is the Haar measure of H. Note that E(a) = µ ∗ a, where µ = hH ◦ ΛH ◦ π (cf. the ﬁrst
part of the proof). By remarks preceding the proof of the theorem we ﬁnd that there are many
non-zero elements of L∞(G/H) which are square integrable for the right Haar measure of G. (cid:3)

One can remark that the character bε constructed in the proof of Theorem 7.3 can easily be
shown to satisfy (bε ⊗ id) ◦ ∆bH = id, so that bε is the counit on L∞(bH).

We end with a re-statement of Theorem 7.3 in terms of integrability (cf. Corollary 3.5).

Corollary 7.5. Let G and H be locally compact quantum groups and let H be a closed quantum
subgroup of G. Then H is compact if and only if the left action of G on G/H given by ∆G is
integrable.
