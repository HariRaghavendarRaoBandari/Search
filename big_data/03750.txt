Luttinger holes with strong Zeemann and spin-orbit interactions in a wire proximity-coupled to
a superconductor is a promising system for observation of Majorana fermions. Earlier treatments
of conﬁned Luttinger holes in wires ignored a mutual transformation of heavy and light holes upon
reﬂection from the heteroboundaries. This eﬀect is crucial for Zeemann and spin-orbit coupling in
the ground subband of holes with several spin-orbit terms linear in momentum. We discuss the
criterion for realizing Majorana modes in charge carrier hole systems. GaAs or InSb hole wires shall
exhibit stronger topological superconducting pairing compared to InSb electron systems in similar
or weaker magnetic ﬁelds.

Quest for Majorana zero modes is an exciting recent
development in physics. Majorana particles are their
own anti-particles that obey non-Abelian statistics and
are promissing for quantum computation[1–3].
In con-
densed matter systems Majorana modes potentially arise
in spinless p-wave superconductors, with candidate sys-
tems under exploration [4]. Several schemes for realizing
Majorana modes generate spinless p-wave superconduc-
tivity in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures
using three ingredients: proximity eﬀects, time reversal
symmetry breaking, and spin-orbit interactions[5–10].

The key problem is optimal conditions for genera-
tion and manipulation of Mayorana fermions, partic-
ularly symmetry and magnitude of spin-orbit interac-
tions. Strong spin-orbit coupling leads to stronger p-
wave pairing [11]. Both electrons and hole systems
were suggested for realizing Majorana modes in hybrid
structures[10, 12, 13]. However, while spin-orbit interac-
tions are relatively well known in electron settings, their
understanding in hole systems is just emerging [14, 15].
Here we present the results on spin-orbit and Zeemann
interactions in hole quantum wells and wires, and discuss
emergence of Majorana modes in hole settings. Spin-
orbit eﬀects in hole wires lead to momentum-dependent
Zeemann ﬁelds in all three spatial directions. Although
the Bogoliubov-De Gennes (BdG) equation cannot have
real solutions in this case, and no choice of the phase of
the superconducting order parameter can decouple real
and imaginary parts of the BdG wavefunctions, zero en-
ergy Majorana mode still exists. The parameter deﬁn-
ing the ability of hybrid systems to show p-type super-
conductivity and Majorana modes is spin-orbit energy
Eso = γ2m, where m is the eﬀective mass and γ is the
spin-orbit constant. While electron γ’s are strong, m’s
are small in InAs and InSb. Our theory shows that Eso
for holes, e.g., in InSb, can be bigger than that for elec-
trons. Furthermore, the hole g-factor can exceed that for
electrons, allowing for smaller magnetic ﬁelds at the same
Zeeman splitting, enhancing the proximity eﬀect. This
makes hole systems a perspective experimental setting.

The treatment of low-dimensional holes is controver-

sial. The majority of authors treats holes like electrons
[12, 16–20]: if the motion of particles is quantized in di-
rection i in a well of width d, their Hamiltonian is solved
by replacing momentum pi by zeros and p2
i by its ex-
pectation value in the ground state, (cid:104) ˆp2
i(cid:105) = (
π
d )2, and
spin-orbit and Zeemann terms are found using perturba-
tion theory. However, this approach for holes is ﬂawed.
It does not account for a mutual transformation of heavy
and light holes upon reﬂection from the heterobound-
aries, Fig.1. Although this eﬀect can be evaluated per-
turbatively by including oﬀ-diagonal terms linear in ki, it
then requires summation of an inﬁnite number of terms,
which are parametrically all the same[15]. An alterna-
tive non-perturbative approach is known since the work
of Nedorezov [21], but is seldom used [15, 22–24]. We
show that in hole wires, this phenomenon strongly af-
fects eﬀective masses, g-factor and spin-orbit constants.

come from admixtures of distant bands and are much
smaller than (5) [14, 28, 29]. We also omit the eﬀect of

Here An = a(a + n − 2), and the asymmetric part of
the potential eF z for − d
2 , due to doping and
external electric ﬁeld, is assumed to be the same for va-
lence and conduction electrons. Distinct oﬀset poten-
tials, Uc for electrons and Uv for holes, result in nonzero
˜ζn = π2ζ(n − 1)(Uc − Uv)/(2d2Uv). For the ground
state, β1 and β3 describe p3 Rashba coupling. The β1-
term has no ζ-contribution and vanishes in spherical ap-
proximation a = 1.
In our approach, the ﬁrst term in

square brackets in (10) arises from the matrix element
(cid:104)±|eF z|∓(cid:105), and accounts for an inﬁnite number of terms
of the same order that arise in a perturbative approach.
Perturbative consideration[30] accounted just for two ex-
cited states and resulted only in (n = 3)-type terms.

The σz-term in Eq.(6) results in skew scattering oﬀ
impurities in the 2D hole gas, but our interest here is
rather such term due to the potential conﬁning the wire.

neglect a small change in 1D mass ∝ d2/w2 due to quartic
terms ∝ p2
y(d/)2, which are omitted in the 2D Hamil-
tonian (6).
In order to ﬁnd α, we consider a model,
in which potentials Uv,e(z, r) are products of functions
that depend only on z and only on x. We take sym-
metric parts of the wire potential for holes and elec-
trons U (s)
θ(x), cor-
respondingly, where θ(x) = −1 at −w/2 < x < w/2 and
θ(x) = 0 otherwise. Then in the presence of the elec-
tric ﬁeld Fx acting on both electrons and holes we obtain
α = 3ζeFx(1 − U (w)
). The results for the constant
α, which turns out to be independent of ˜V , and for the
contribution to β3 arising from (5) are the consequences
of the Ehrenfest theorem on vanishing average gradient
of a potential in conﬁned states.
The ground state in a wire is separated by a sizable gap
from excited states for in-plane and z−direction quanti-
zation. Eq.
(12) fully takes into account physics and
all features of charge carrier holes via the modiﬁed mass,
g-factor and spin-orbit constants. The advantage of this
electron-like Hamiltonian is that methods similar to those
in [9, 31, 32] can be used investigate the Majorana modes.

tions in spin space with respect to z and x axis, (12) can

the proximity eﬀect [26, 33–38]. Assuming holes only in
the ground band of the wire, we write the superconduct-

- states in the ground subband, and ∆eiφ is the pairing
potential. The corresponding BdG Hamiltonian in the
Nambu spinor τ space reads:

HBdG = (

− µ + γσyp)τz + Mz(cosθσz + sinθσy)
(14)

+ ∆cosφτx − ∆sinφτy.

In order to show the existence of Majorana modes, we
prove that there is a non-degenerate solution at E = 0
of the BdG equation HBdGΨ = EΨ [31]. Due to the
particle-hole symmetry, this solution should take the
form Ψ = (ψ, iσyψ∗), where ψ is a two-spinor. We have

[(

+∆eiφiσyψ∗ = 0

(15)

Writing ψ = ψR + iψI and using Eq. (15), we obtain

(17)

Analyzing Majorana modes so far, we followed [31]. How-
ever, we observe from our Eq.(16) that the sign of the
Zeemann term in the Eq. (59) of [31] should be +, not
-. As a result, Eqs.(16) and (17) for ΨI and ΨR cannot
be both decoupled by a unique choice of the order pa-
rameter phase φ, Mzsinθ = ∆sinφ. For such choice, Eq.
(17) will ”decouple”, containing and deﬁning ΨI only,
but Eq.(16) will still connect ΨI and ΨR. Similarly, for
Mzsinθ = −∆sinφ, Eq. (16) will contain and deﬁne ΨR
only, but Eq.(17) will still connect ΨI and ΨR.
We now demonstrate that Majorana zero mode exists
for any of the choices Mzsinθ = λ∆sinφ, where λ = ±1.
The equations for the corresponding functions ψR (λ = 1)
or ψI (λ = −1) are given by (λ = ±1):

correspond to ∆ < Mzsinθ and M 2

arbitrary φ the constraint |∆| > |Mzsinθ| is necessary
for existence of a topological superconductor in proxim-
itized hole wires. If sinθ = 1, i.e. the Zeeman ﬁeld is
aligned with the spin-orbit ﬁeld, the Majorana modes
do not exist. If sinθ = 0, Majorana modes arise if Eq.
(20) is satisﬁed. Furthermore, Majorana modes exist at
Mzsinθ = ±∆sinφ, for ” intermediate” θ. This pre-
cludes the possibility that only sinθ = 0 case, i.e. when
the BdG equations are equivalent to those with real coef-
ﬁcients, gives Majorana modes, while for all other θ these
modes disappear. Thus, there is a critical angle θc (cid:54)= 0
that separates regions of the phase diagram where the
topological superconductivity exists. Our result is that
this critical angle is given by ∆ = Mzsinθc. To see this,
we solve the BdG equation numerically and ﬁnd the en-
ergy spectra and the wavefunctions, Fig.2. We observe
that the Majorana zero mode exists only when both con-
ditions are satisﬁed, and disappears when one of the con-
ditions is not fullﬁlled. The extra constraint means that
the σz-term should not be too large compared to the
Rashba and Dresselhaus terms.
In Fig.3 we show the
ground state BdG energies for diﬀerent ∆ and sinθ.

We suggest that hole wires in GaAs or InSb structures,
in which surface levels are in the forbidden gap and make
proximity eﬀect in p-type structures feasible, are favor-
able for detection of Majorana modes. For w = 80nm

Re[τ ] < 0 for λ = −1, or 1 root with Re[τ ] > 0 and 3
roots with Re[τ ] < 0 for λ = 1. For C0 > 0 there are two
roots with Re[τ ] ≶ 0. Because there are one normaliza-
tion and four boundary conditions, a unique bound state
solution exists on the boundary between the topological
non-trivial phase with C0 = ∆2 +µ2−M 2
z < 0 and a triv-
ial phase with C0 > 0, in much the same way as in [7, 8].
Once ψR/I is found from Eq. (16) or Eq. (17) for a given
choice of φ, ψI/R can be found using the other equation
coupling ψR/I and ψI/R. Normalization of wavefunctions
is achieved using equations that contain only ψR or only
ψI . At E = 0 these ψI/R deﬁne the waveﬁunction of
the Majorana bound state. Then the criterion for the
topological superconductivity in hole wires is

M 2

z > µ2 + ∆2.

(20)

In order to arrive to this result, we used one of the rela-
tions Mzsinθ = ±∆sinφ. As φ can be made arbitrary,
an extra constraint for existence of Majorana modes is

|∆| ≥ |Mzsinθ|.

(21)

Does Majorana mode exist when none of the equations
(16) or (17) can be decoupled? We now show that for

logical and non-topological superconducting order occurs
at H ∼ 0.8T . Then Eso ∼ Mz ∼ 0.2meV , and the lowest
single-hole state is in transition from type Fig1.b to a
type Fig1c, i.e., spin-orbit coupling is somewhat strong
and leads to eﬀective p-pairing.

For a similar InSb wire in InSb/AlInSb structure, at
γ1 = 40.1, γ2 = 18.1, γ3 = 19.2, κ = 17.0, q = 0.5,
P = 9.6eV ˚A, Eg = 0.23eV and [28] δαv = 70 eV ˚A3,
we obtain γ ∼ 250meV ˚A, and g ∼ 90. Due to strain
in this system, we take the wire mass m = 0.04m0 [39]
[according to (7) at zero strain, m = 0.018m0]. Then
Eso ∼ 0.4meV . In proximity with NbN at ∆ ∼ 0.15meV ,
ns = 2×1010cm−2, we obtain that the transition between
topological and non-topological superconductivity in the
InSb hole wire at H ∼ 0.4T .
In this case Mz > Eso,
and the ground state of (13) has single-minimum Fig.1c
shape, which also takes place in an electron InSb wire
[33] with Eso 4 times smaller than here.

Conclusion. We considered charge carrier hole wires
non-perturbatively, including the eﬀect of mutual trans-
formation of heavy and light holes upon reﬂection from
heteroboundaries, and derived the hole g-factor and spin-
orbit interactions. Beyond Majorana context, these re-
sults are important for the ﬁeld of spin-based electronics,
and relevant for gate-induced, lithographically deﬁned
and cleaved edge overgrowth [20] wires, for generation,
manipulation and transmission of spin currents. We con-
sidered a criterion for transition from non-topological to
topological superconducting order in proximity-coupled
hole nanowires, showing that Majorana modes can arise
even if the Bogoliubov-De Gennes equations for real and
imaginary components of the wavefunction cannot be de-
coupled. We evaluated Majorana settings in GaAs and
InSb hole wires, and demonstrated that these systems po-
tentially exhibit considerably stronger p-type proximity-
induced superconducting pairing compared to InSb elec-
tron system in similar magnetic ﬁelds.
