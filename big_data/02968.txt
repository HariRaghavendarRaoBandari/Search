We propose to control light trapping in a large ensemble of cold atoms by an external, static
magnetic ﬁeld. For an appropriate choice of frequency and polarization of the exciting pulse, the ﬁeld
is expected to speed up the ﬂuorescence of a dilute atomic system but can signiﬁcantly slow it down
in a dense ensemble. The slowing down of ﬂuorescence is due to the excitation of spatially localized
collective atomic states that appear only under a strong magnetic ﬁeld and have exponentially long
lifetimes. The control of ﬂuorescence by the magnetic ﬁeld may be of interest for use in future
quantum-information processing devices. It also paves a way towards the experimental observation
of the disorder-induced localization of light in cold atomic systems.

Manipulating quantum states of atomic ensembles
opens interesting possibilities for storage and, potentially,
processing of quantum information [1, 2]. Particularly in-
teresting are long-lived atomic states that can be used to
trap an optical excitation (a photon) for a time τ much
exceeding the lifetime τ0 of the excited state of an isolated
atom. A very eﬃcient way to trap a photon in an atomic
medium is based on the use of the phenomenon of elec-
tromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [3, 4] that is
accompanied by a very slow or even vanishing group ve-
locity of a weak probe pulse in a medium manipulated by
a strong control beam [5, 6]. Another phenomenon that
can substantially delay a photon in an atomic medium
is Dicke subradiance [7, 8].
In contrast to EIT, it is a
linear, single-photon eﬀect relying on the interference of
electromagnetic emissions of diﬀerent atoms adding up
destructively and leading to a slowing down of the decay
of a collective atomic state with time. Recent theoreti-
cal [9, 10] and experimental [11] results suggest that the
lifetime τ of a subradiant state should grow roughly lin-
early with the size R of the atomic system. A larger
τ ∝ R2 can be obtained under conditions of diﬀuse scat-
tering of near-resonant light in relatively dense atomic
clouds [12]. In the present Letter we propose and theo-
retically investigate a diﬀerent mechanism for trapping of
light in an atomic system—a mechanism making use of a
disorder-induced spatial localization of collective atomic
states [13, 14]. The lifetimes of the latter grow exponen-
tially with the sample size R and under realistic condi-
tions, can be many orders of magnitude longer than the
lifetimes of both the subradiant states and the states that
build up in the regime of diﬀuse light scattering. There
is a price to pay, however, since the disorder-induced lo-
calization of light in three dimensions turns out to be
diﬃcult to achieve in any system [15] and even impossi-
ble in an atomic ensemble in the absence of external ﬁelds
[16]. Localized states were predicted to appear only in
dense atomic systems under suﬃciently strong magnetic
ﬁelds [14]. This additional complication can be turned

into advantage because the ﬁeld can be used to tune the
spatial localization of atomic states and their decay with
time thus providing an eﬃcient means of control over the
trapping of light.

We consider an experimentally relevant situation of
a short laser pulse (central frequency ωL, duration τL)
incident on a spherical cloud (radius R, volume V ) of
N two-level atoms located at random positions ri ∈ V
(i = 1, . . . , N ). An atom i has a ground state |gi(cid:105) with
the total angular momentum Jg = 0, an excited state
|ei(cid:105) with Je = 1, a transition frequency ω0, and a natural
lifetime of the excited state τ0 = 1/Γ0. The atoms are
subject to a static, spatially uniform magnetic ﬁeld B
that splits the otherwise triply degenerate excited state
|ei(cid:105) into three substates |eim(cid:105) corresponding to the mag-
netic quantum numbers m = 0, ±1, respectively. The
Hamiltonian of the atomic system interacting with the
free electromagnetic ﬁeld is [14, 17]

The state of the atomic system can be represented in
terms of eigenvectors Ψn of G to which we will therefore
refer as ‘quasi-modes’. The eigenvalues Λn of G yield
the frequencies ωn = ω0 − (Γ0/2)ReΛn and decay rates

In spherical coordinates, kin = {ω/c, 0} and k =

waves, respectively. The unit vector uin determines the
polarization of the incident wave and the vectors u(cid:48)

respond to two possible orthogonal polarization of scat-
tered light.
In the following we will use Eq. (4) aver-
aged over the ensemble of possible atomic conﬁgurations
{ri} to study the average intensity of the time-dependent
ﬂuorescence (cid:104)I(Ω, t)(cid:105). For illustrative purposes, we will
restrict our consideration to rectangular incident pulses
having a central frequency ωL = ω0 + δLΓ0, where δL is
the detuning of the incident light in units of Γ0. However,
similar results are expected for any pulse of well-deﬁned
duration.

When the number density of atoms ρ = N/V is low,
the magnetic ﬁeld speeds up the ﬂuorescence as we show

with Je = 1, m = −1. This is due to the decrease of
the atomic scattering cross-section in the magnetic ﬁeld
[17] and the consequent decrease of the optical thickness
of the cloud. In contrast, at high ρ a dramatic slowing
down of ﬂuorescence is observed at long times for de-
tunings δL (cid:39) −∆ [see Fig. 1(b)]. We explain this result
by the appearance of spatially localized collective atomic

ﬁelds [14]. These localized states have eigenfrequencies
ω (cid:39) ω0 ± ∆Γ0 + Γ0 and very long lifetimes decreasing
exponentially with the sample size R [14]. They domi-
nate (cid:104)I(Ω, t)(cid:105) at long times, when all other states excited
by the incident beam have died out. Analysis of Fig. 1
allows us to conclude that the magnetic ﬁeld impacts
both far- and near-ﬁeld properties of inter-atomic inter-
actions, but its inﬂuence on the near-ﬁeld eﬀects (that

rameters as in Fig. 1(b) but for a much longer exciting pulse

(τL = 103Γ

region.

data as in Fig. 1(b)] and m = 0 (orange dashed line and tri-
angles). The inset shows a sketch of experimental situation

suppress the disorder-induced localization in the absence
of the ﬁeld [16]) is more pronounced.
It is worthwhile
to note that results similar to those presented in Fig. 1
for θ = π/6 and m = −1 were also obtained for other
scattering angles θ as well as for right-handed circular
polarized incident light that excites transitions between
|gi(cid:105) and |eim(cid:105) with m = 1. In the latter case, the slowing
down of ﬂuorescence is observed for δL (cid:39) ∆ instead of
δL (cid:39) −∆ for m = −1 in Fig. 1(b).

The magnetic ﬁeld does not only slow down the ﬂu-
orescence but also modiﬁes the functional form of the
decay of (cid:104)I(Ω, t)(cid:105). Figure 2 shows the inverse of the de-
cay rate Γ(Ω, t) = ∂ ln(cid:104)I(Ω, t)(cid:105)/∂t as a function of time t
for Ω = {π/6, ϕ}. We see that in the absence of the ﬁeld
(∆ = 0) the decay rate Γ is almost independent of time.
This is perfectly consistent with the diﬀuse nature of ra-
diation transport that we have established under such
conditions previously [16, 20].
In contrast, in a strong
magnetic ﬁeld (∆ = 103), 1/Γ grows roughly linearly
with time which is at odds with the diﬀusive picture of
scattering. The growth rate of 1/Γ strongly depends on
the detuning δL of the exciting radiation from the atomic
resonance and reaches a maximum for δL (cid:39) m∆ + 1. It
is precisely the regime in which localized states are ex-
pected to appear in the atomic system [14], which once
again conﬁrms the major role of these states for the slow
decay of ﬂuorescence reported in Fig. 1(b). As follows
from Fig. 2, the magnetic ﬁeld suppresses the ﬂuorescence
decay rate by at least an order of magnitude in an atomic
cloud that contains only as much as N ∼ 103 atoms. A
much stronger eﬀect is expected in larger clouds.

Because localized states are expected to appear only
in the vicinity of resonant frequencies ω = ω0 ± ∆Γ0
corresponding to transitions from the ground state to the

FIG. 4. Short-time dynamics of ﬂuorescence under the same
conditions as in Fig. 1(b). The dashed straight line shows the
fast initial decay due to the superradiance phenomenon, with
the decay rate Γmax (cid:39) 12Γ0 following from Eq. (5).

excited states with m = ±1, but not in the vicinity of ω =
ω0 corresponding to the transition to the state with m =
0 [14], it is interesting to compare the time-dependent
ﬂuorescence for the exciting radiation detuned by δL (cid:39)
±∆ from the atomic resonance with that for δL (cid:39) 0. Such
a comparison shown in Fig. 3 reveals that the ﬂuorescence
decays much slower for δL (cid:39) −∆ than for δL (cid:39) 0. An
experimental observation of such an important diﬀerence
in decay rates may serve as an evidence of the presence
of localized states in the atomic system.
In contrast to the long-time decay, the behavior of
(cid:104)I(Ω, t)(cid:105) at short time scales is not expected to be sen-
sitive to the presence of localized states. However, this
behavior still exhibits a number of interesting features
including the phenomenon of Dicke superradiance [7, 8].
The latter is manifest in a rapid initial decay of (cid:104)I(Ω, t)(cid:105)

4

Γ > 7Γ0 can be found in a wide spectral range around
the resonant detuning δ = −∆ (and also around δ = ∆,
not shown in Fig. 5). These states are responsible for the
rapid initial decay of intensity in Fig. 4. Their wide spec-
tral distribution explains the independence of the initial
decay from the detuning δL of the exiting pulse. Quasi-
modes with intermediate decay rates Γ0 < Γ < 3Γ0 follow
peculiar double-peak distributions with minima in the
vicinity of δ = ±∆. Quantum beatings between states
of this group are at the origin of intensity oscillations in
Fig. 4. Finally, states with extremely low decay rates
Γ < 10−4Γ0 are concentrated around δ (cid:39) ±∆ + 1 and
are spatially localized according to our previous analysis
[14]. These states produce the slow decay of scattered
intensity at long times shown in Figs. 1(b) and 3.

In conclusion, we predict that an external magnetic
ﬁeld should allow for an eﬃcient control of light trapping
in large ensembles of cold atoms. We illustrate this re-
sult by considering the limit of a very strong ﬁeld but
similar conclusions hold in weaker ﬁelds as well. In di-
lute atomic clouds, the ﬁeld is expected to speed up the
ﬂuorescence which can be explained by the decrease of
the scattering crosssection of individual atoms under the
inﬂuence of the ﬁeld. In contrast, the ﬂuorescence of a
dense atomic cloud can be dramatically slowed down by
an external magnetic ﬁeld. Localized quasi-modes made
possible by the ﬁeld can trap photons for extremely long
times thus delaying their exit from the atomic medium.
A suppression of ﬂuorescence rate by at least an order
of magnitude is predicted by our calculations for atomic
ensembles composed of N ∼ 103 atoms; an even stronger
eﬀect is expected for larger N . In contrast, the short-time
decay rate of ﬂuorescence is not sensitive to the appear-
ance of localized states and thus is not modiﬁed by the
magnetic ﬁeld. It is accelerated with respect to the decay
of an isolated atom due to the phenomenon of superra-
diance; an acceleration by a factor of 12 is found in our
calculations, in agreement with expectations from the an-
alytic theory. At intermediate time scales of order of the
natural lifetime of the excited state of an isolated atom,
the intensity of ﬂuorescence develops oscillations that can
be understood as a consequence of quantum beatings be-
tween quasi-modes having red and blue detunings with
respect to the frequency of localized quasi-modes. Our
theoretical results can be readily veriﬁed in the state-
of-the-art experiments and constitute an important step
towards creation of controllable optical elements for fu-
ture photonic devices to be used for quantum information
storage and processing. In addition, they suggest a prac-
tical way of observing the disorder-induced localization
of light expected to take place in dense atomic ensembles
in strong magnetic ﬁelds [14].

frequency ωL of the exciting pulse, at least as long as
ωL remains close to the resonant frequency of one of the
three resonant atomic transitions (m = 0, ±1; only the
results for m = −1 are shown in Fig. 4). This is not sur-
prising because the initial decay of (cid:104)I(Ω, t)(cid:105) is dominated
by quasi-modes with large decay rates Γ that are excited
with very similar weights independent from the frequency
of incident beam and from the magnetic ﬁeld. To esti-
mate the decay rate Γmax of the most rapidly decaying
quasi-modes, we use an equation for the boundary of the
eigenvalue domain of the Green’s matrix G obtained in
the diﬀusion approximation [21, 22]:

tion of Eq. (5) with Λ = iΓmax/Γ0 yields Γmax (cid:39) 12Γ0.
This result shown by a dashed line in Fig. 4 describes
quite well the initial fast decay of scattered intensity. It
is worthnoting, however, that the short-time decay of
(cid:104)I(Ω, t)(cid:105) depends on Ω, with the fastest decay taking
place in forward scattering (θ = 0). Thus, Γmax is a
good estimation but not an exact result. At longer times

pronounced oscillatory behavior that survives ensemble
averaging. Even though these oscillations are already
visible in the absence of external magnetic ﬁeld, they are
largely ampliﬁed by the latter.

A qualitative understanding of diﬀerent regimes of ﬂu-
orescence reported above can be achieved by analyzing
the spectral distribution of quasi-modes of the system
with decay rates Γ = Γ0ImΛ in diﬀerent characteristic
ranges (see Fig. 5). Quasi-modes with large decay rates
