We report on an optimal single-electron charge qubit for a solid-state double quantum dot (DQD)
system and analyse its dynamics under a time-dependent linear detuning, using GPU accelerated
numerical solutions to the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation. The optimal qubit is found to
have basis states deﬁned as the symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of the lowest
energy bonding and anti-bonding states of the DQD at zero bias.
In contrast to charge qubits
deﬁned by the two localised ground states of the uncoupled DQD, this choice of the basis causes the
resulting dynamics to have a maximal overlap with an idealised two-state model. Our optimal qubit
basis states are not localised to a single quantum dot and, as such, initialising the qubit requires a
particular sequence of gate pulses to take the system from an initial ﬁducial state of the DQD to the
logical 0 or 1. We determine this sequence using pulses that incorporate the expected experimental
ﬁnite rise times. We also show how to perform arbitrary single qubit operations on the Bloch sphere
using spin-echo type pulsing, allowing us to obtain any qubit state with at most two single pulses.
Measurement of the optimal qubits is achieved by determining the probability of ﬁnding the electron
in one of the dots.

INTRODUCTION

with an eﬀective Hamiltonian ˆHeﬀ deﬁned by

Solid-state devices are attractive candidates for the im-
plementation of practical quantum computation because
of their high integrability into current industrial produc-
tion lines as well as their cheap processing costs. Ow-
ing to advances in growth and fabrication techniques,
high scalability and long coherence times, signiﬁcant ad-
vances have been made towards the realisation of practi-
cal, scalable qubits in silicon and III-V material-based
quantum dot structures [1–5]. Double quantum dots
(DQDs), which consist of two adjacent tunnel-coupled
quantum wells, oﬀer a way of producing a qubit based
on the charge of a single electron [6, 7]. In these systems,
the qubit basis states are nominally considered to be the
localised ground state wave functions of the uncoupled
quantum dots. Single qubit operations can be achieved
by applying external potentials to surface gates [3, 4] or
nearby electron or hole reservoirs [1, 2]. These pulses
alter the relative energies of the two quantum wells and
the tunnel barrier between them, allowing the qubit to
oscillate between the basis states. Previous experimen-
tal work has realised manipulation of charge qubits in
GaAs/AlGaAs [1, 3, 8, 9] and Si:P [10] devices.

In general, experiments show that the dynamics of
these charge qubits can be modelled approximately using
a two-site localised state model (LSM) which obeys the
Time Dependent Scr¨odinger Equation (TDSE)

Here, ε(t) is the ‘detuning parameter’ which is pulsed
in order to manipulate the charge qubit. The constant
term deﬁnes the energy zero, where EB and EAB are the
energies of the bonding and antibonding states, i.e. the
two lowest energy states, at ε = 0. The parameter ∆
is the ‘hybridisation energy’ between the two localised
states. Ideally, the basis states of this model, labelled ψL
and ψR, should be time-independent and fully localised
on each of the LSM sites. However, for realistic poten-
tials, the states fully localised on one side of a double dot
potential contain contributions from high energy states
which can cause complex intra dot charge oscillations to
occur under charge qubit manipulation [9]. As we will
see, the two lowest eigenstates of the system can be used
as the basis states but since they are delocalised across
the two dots, it is better to use orthogonal linear com-
binations that are localised so that readout of the qubit
state can simply be a measurement of which dot the elec-
tron collapses to after manipulation.

In this paper, we use a generic model eﬀective potential
for a solid-state DQD system to ﬁnd an optimal qubit ba-
sis, which has greatest overlap with the stationary qubits
across a range of detunings (section II). In section III we
show how to initialise a single electron into one of the
qubit basis states and how to perform a set of mutu-
ally orthogonal rotations on the Bloch sphere using ﬁnite
rise-time pulses. In section IV, we provide a way of re-
lating measurement outcomes to qubit superposition co-
eﬃcients. We ﬁnish with the discussion of the results
(section V) and the conclusions (section VI).

2

a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, the z direction is the
growth direction and modulation doping can be used to
create a triangular quantum well in that direction with
subband energies two orders of magnitude larger than ei-
ther ε or ∆. In the y direction, parabolic conﬁnement
with energies an order of magnitude larger than ε or ∆
can be produced either by etching [13], fabricating a thin
gate wrapping the conducting channel [14, 15] or using
split-gates [16]. In order to create a DQD potential in
the x direction, gates [17–20] or etching [13, 21] can also
be used.

The aim is to create a potential VDQD(x, t) that has
two minima separated by a tunnel barrier. A convenient
potential that has this property and is deﬁned by four
parameters z0, z2 and w1, w2 is given by

VDQD(x) =

(3)
This form for VDQD allows us to control both the depth
of the dots and the barrier between them directly, using
the parameters z0 and z2, respectively. For a speciﬁc set
of parameters, this static potential will deﬁne a value for
∆ which is the energy diﬀerence between the bonding
ground state EB and the antibonding ﬁrst excited state
EAB. Detuning is introduced by adding a linear stark
shift of the form

II. OPTIMAL SINGLE-ELECTRON CHARGE

QUBITS

We start by describing a four-parameter model for the
eﬀective potential in a DQD system that allows us to con-
trol both the depth of the dots and the barrier between
them directly whilst also allowing us to apply detuning
as a linear Stark shift. Using this potential, we then de-
ﬁne the optimal DQD qubit basis states being careful
to make sure that the result is deﬁned and accessible to
experimental DQD systems.

A. The double quantum dot potential

The eﬀective potential in an experimental DQD sys-
tem can be found using density functional theory [11, 12]
and will be a complex function of all three spatial coor-
dinates x, y, z. By careful design, the dynamics in two
of the directions y and z can be conﬁned to the lowest
energy subbands so that only the potential in the x di-
rection, VDQD(x, t) needs be considered. For example in

Vbias(x) = Vslope

x
2w2

.

(4)

By comparing the dependences of EB and EAB on Vslope
with the expected dependences from LSM Hamiltonian
we can deﬁne the detuning parameter for VDQD through
a linear relation ε = λVslope with λ being constant. We
ﬁnd this linear relationship holds with an accuracy of one
part in 106 across the range of required values of ε for
single-qubit operations. The total potential is Vtot(x) =
VDQD(x) + Vbias(x) and Fig. 1 (a) shows this potential at
three diﬀerent detunings.

The DQD dynamics under time-dependent detuning

will be given by the TDSE

ˆH(x, t)ψ(x, t) = i ∂
∂t

ψ(x, t)

with

ˆH(x, t) = − 2
2m∗

∂2
∂x2 + VDQD(x) + Vbias(x, t).

(5)

(6)

Time dependence is included in Eq. 5 by varying the
potential slope with time: Vslope(t). An example plot
of the energies of the two lowest instantaneous solutions
(the bonding and antibonding states) as function of Vslope
is shown in Fig. 1 (b).

Analytic solutions to the TDSE in Eq. 6 can only
be found in special cases.
In this paper we solve
Eq. 5 numerically using a GPU-accelerated version of the
staggered-leapfrog method [22, 23] (see App. A, App. B).

Here and throughout the paper we use the parame-
ter values: w1 = 130nm, w2 = 240nm, z0 = 0.865meV,
z2 = 6.92meV so that ∆ = 12µeV, and the linear co-
eﬃcient λ = 0.42254. The values are chosen to be in
agreement with the experiments [1, 24], however, our con-
clusions are applicable to any DQD system and do not
depend on the speciﬁc choice of parameter values. We
have also tested various non-symmetric potentials with
the two dots having diﬀerent sizes, but in all the cases
the general conclusions were the same as for the symmet-
ric potential of Eq. 3.

B. The optimal qubit basis

We denote the optimal qubit basis for the poten-
tial VDQD(x) as the two states ψ0(x) and ψ1(x).
In
order to make measurement of arbitrary qubit states
ψ(x) = αψ0(x) + βψ1(x) as straightforward as possible
these basis states would ideally be maximally localised
in the left and right dots respectively. This is because
experimentally, it is possible to measure the probability
that an electron will tunnel out of a quantum dot and this
probability is in turn proportional to the probability that
the electron is in that dot. Also, in order to avoid com-
plex transient oscillations, the qubit basis states should
be linear combinations of the two lowest instantaneous
eigenstates of the DQD system. For the Hamiltonian in
Eq. 6, the two lowest eigenstates are the instantaneous
ε (x) and ψAB
bonding and anti-bonding states ψB
(x) for
detuning ε. Hence, the qubit basis states will be,

ε

Rε(x) = αεψB
Lε(x) = βεψB

ε (x) + βεψAB
ε (x) − αεψAB
where αε and βε are real variables, α2
is chosen such that the integral

is maximised. Readout would then simply be a matter
of determining which dot the electron wave function col-
lapsed into. However, for a given pulse sequence these
qubit basis states are time-dependent and cannot easily
be compared to qubits with diﬀerent detunings ε. There-
fore, it is preferable to deﬁne a stationary qubit basis, in-
dependent of ε. Optimal basis states of this type should
have the greatest overlap with Rε(x) and Lε(x) for all
detunings. Fig. 2 shows a correlation function D(ε, ε(cid:48))
that will be a minimum when this condition is met:

The detuning range is chosen such that the ﬁdelity

D(ε, ε(cid:48)) = 1−

is always (cid:62) 99% for all values of ε, where, φε(x) =
aεR0(x) + bεL0(x), (aε,bε) is the corresponding bonding
solution to ˆHeﬀ in Eq. 2, and a similar measure is per-
formed for the anti-bonding state. As expected, D(ε, ε(cid:48))
is smallest between states where the diﬀerence in detun-
ings is small. However, as we want to apply large biases
across the double dot system, the best qubit states are
the ones where D(ε, ε(cid:48)) is minimised over the entire do-
main ε − ε(cid:48).

Using this criterion, we ﬁnd that the best choice of
states from which to build the qubits of the system are
the bonding and anti-bonding states at zero detuning.
By parity inversion symmetry when Vbias(x, t) = 0, if
x → −x then R0(x) → L0(x) with ψB

0 (x) and

Therefore, our optimal charge qubits are deﬁned as

These qubits are optimal in the sense that they have
the greatest overlap with the maximally localised states
in Eqs. 7 and 8 across the speciﬁed range of detunings.
These states are not fully localised as the probability den-
sity of ψ0(x) in the left dot is non-zero, and similarly
for ψ1(x) in the right dot (Fig. 3). However, these are
the states which maximise the sum of probabilities (red
colour plot in Fig. 3) and further localisation of the states
would include higher-energy states which would not obey
the ideal LSM Hamiltonian in Eq. 2 which we want to
model.

The qubit we have established here, as a linear com-
bination of bonding and anti-bonding states at zero de-
tuning, is well deﬁned in any DQD system including po-
tentials that are not spatially symmetric. Since, in the
deﬁnition, there is no reference to the underlying eﬀec-
tive potential of the DQD, this qubit is also well deﬁned
for an experimental system.

The qubit states we have chosen ψ0(x) and ψ1(x) form
a static two-state system. Their ideal dynamics is de-
scribed by the TDSE with Hamiltonian ˆHeﬀ in Eq. 2 so
that, in terms of the polar and azimuthal angles on the
Bloch sphere

φeﬀ (x, t) = cos

ψ0(x) + e−iφ(t) sin

(14)
The dynamics of the state under ˆH will be diﬀerent but,
we ﬁnd that owing to the choice of the detuning range
we have made (Sec.
II B), the diﬀerence between the
solutions to Eq. 1 and Eq. 5 is always less than one
percent.

FIG. 4.
(a) Standard and (b) spin-echo pulse types. To
maximise the qubit probability value (before the electron de-
coheres), the measurement point was chosen to be just after
the pulse ends [25].

ε0 and ε1 as this simpliﬁes the dynamics and avoids spu-
rious qubit rotations [26]. For an instantaneously pulsed
Hamiltonian where the detuning ε(t) can be described as
a set of step-functions, R(cid:126)n(ϑ) can be expressed analyti-
cally as a rotation of the qubit state around the axis on
the Bloch sphere which passes through the eigenstates of
H(t(cid:48)) at a rate proportional to the diﬀerence in energy
of these two eigenstates. Such a pulse requires a linear
potential along the axis of the double dot potential, as
in Eq. 6, which is achieved by applying voltages to a set
of metallic surface gates. However, the response of the
electronics to an instantaneous pulse has a ﬁnite band-
width which reduces the response time of the potential
Vslope(t) and introduces a ﬁnite rise time τ (see Fig. 4
(a)). In this case, the step-function decomposition is not
possible and, in general, Eq. 15 must be solved numeri-
cally. If the detuning can be described in terms of linear
ramp functions, then Eq. 15 can be written analytically
as a Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg transition [27–29] but the
resulting expression is a function of parabolic cylinder
functions which does not simplify understanding of the
rotation R(cid:126)n(ϑ). Instead, we solved Eq. 15 numerically us-
ing a GPU-accelerated version of the staggered-leapfrog
method [22, 23] (see App. A, App. B). In our simulations,
we use a value of τ = 90ps which is consistent with the
experiments of Fujisawa et al. [1, 24].

A general qubit operation can be deﬁned as a right-
hand rotation on the Bloch sphere by an angle ϑ around
a direction (cid:126)n. For the Hamiltonian in Eq. 6, this rotation
is given by the solution to the TDSE:

R(cid:126)n(ϑ(t)) = T exp

(15)

where T is the time-ordering operator. We can perform
the rotations by varying the detuning ε. The simplest
way to do this is by pulsing between two diﬀerent values
of the detuning ε0 and ε1 with a pulse duration tp. It is
desirable for the pulse to instantaneously switch between

so that the rotation in Eq. 15 becomes

(18)

A generic feature of qubit rotations with ﬁnite rise
times is that the path of an individual qubit state on
the Bloch sphere during the time-evolution in Eq. 15 is
not the same as the overall rotation given by R(cid:126)n(ϑ) [30].
In fact, as with all solid rotations on a sphere, in or-
der to describe R(cid:126)n(ϑ) we need to evolve three non-linear
points on the sphere in order to reconstruct R(cid:126)n(ϑ): For
√
the Bloch sphere, this means three linearly independent
√
states, which we chose to be ψ0(x), (ψ0(x) + ψ1(x))/
2
and (ψ0(x) + iψ1(x))/

2.

A. State preparation

It is important to be able to initialise a qubit in a well
deﬁned state, preferably ψ0(x) or ψ1(x). For a generic
experiment involving a charge qubit, we would expect
the initial state of the electron to be the ground state of
Eq. 6. This is not one of the qubit states so, in order to
initialise the electron in the qubit state, we need to per-
form a rotation. The exact parameters required for this
procedure will vary for diﬀerent detunings ε, for example,
at certain detunings, the ground state wave function will
be closer to one of the qubit basis states, but the general
procedure reported here is the same.

To rotate the wave function from the initial eigenstate
to the qubit ψ0(x) state, we applied a trapezoidal pulse,
as shown in Fig. 4 (a). We performed a sweep of pulse
lengths tp and detuning amplitudes A = ε and calculated
the distance

S(ψ0, ψ) = 1 −

0(x)ψ(x)dx

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:90) ∞

−∞

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

(16)

between the resultant state ψ(x) and the qubit state
ψ0(x).
For an initial static detuning Vslope(0) =
0.06508meV, corresponding to ε = 27.5µeV we found
that this distance was minimized when tp = 537ps and
A = 11.5µeV with an accuracy of S < 10−5.

In experiment, these parameters can be found by ap-
plying the same pulse to two distinct systems: one ini-
tialised in the ground state, and the other in the ﬁrst
excited state, then performing a sweep over pulse am-
plitudes and lengths and ﬁnding those which maximise
the summed probability of ﬁnding the former state in the
right and the latter one in the left dot, respectively, in
agreement with Fig. 3.

B.

σx rotations

R(cid:126)n(ϑ(t)) = R(cid:126)x(ϑ(t)) = exp

Having prepared the qubit in the state ψ0(x), we will
now demonstrate how to perform a σx rotation through
an angle ϑ on the Bloch sphere. When the response time
of the quantum system is negligible, ie. τ = 0, this rota-
tion is achieved by switching the detuning to zero. For
ε = 0, the Hamiltonian in Eq. 2 takes the form

ˆHeﬀ = − 1
2

∆ σx

(17)

Once the qubit has rotated by the desired angle, the
detuning is returned to its original value. With ﬁnite
rise times, this process translates to a trapezoidal pulse
shape similar to the one used for the state preparation in
Sec. III A.

Signiﬁcantly, the trapezoidal pulse is not able to pro-
duce a pure σx rotation. To show this, we initiated the
qubit in the ψ0(x) state and swept A in the range de-

scribed in Sec. II B and tp from 0 to 1000 ps (enough for
all the rotations to make at least one full circle on the
Bloch sphere). After choosing the values for which the
oscillation amplitude, deﬁned as the diﬀerence between
the maximum and the minimum probabilities of ﬁnding
the qubit in the other state ψ1(x), was the highest, we
used these optimal pulse parameters on the set of three
mutually orthogonal states from Sec. III to map the pulse
to the rotation:

R(cid:126)n(ϑ(t)) = R(cid:126)x(κ(t − 2τ ))R(cid:126)ntrans (ϑtrans),

(19)

where (cid:126)ntrans is the axis of a transient rotation due to the
ﬁnite rise and, for the tunnelling energy and pulse rise
times we have chosen, κ = 0.029 and ϑtrans = π − 0.10.
Importantly, the transient rotation axis (cid:126)ntrans is not
aligned with the σz axis so these rotations do not com-
mute and cannot be translated into a pure σx rotation.
With the trapezoidal pulse, we were therefore unable to
ﬁnd any values of A and tp for which the qubit experi-
enced a pure σx rotation on the Bloch sphere.

The solution, inspired by the spin-echo technique [31],
was to use the modiﬁed pulse shown in Fig. 4 (b). The
counter-detuning, of amplitude ¯A(cid:48), applied at the begin-
ning and end of the pulse was introduced to correct the
transient rotation generated by the ﬁnite rise time. We
swept the parameters A(cid:48), ¯A(cid:48) and measured the oscilla-
tion amplitude as we vary tp. The resulting amplitudes
are shown in Fig. 5. For a high ﬁdelity σx rotation, the
state should oscillate between ψ0(x) and ψ1(x), so that
the amplitude of the oscillation should equal 1. We found
the region with the highest oscillation amplitude and per-
formed more detailed sweeps around it, as shown in Fig.
6. Testing the results on the same set of three mutu-
ally orthogonal states, we were able to generate a qubit
rotation of the form

R(cid:126)n(ϑ(t)) = R(cid:126)x(ϑ0 + κ(cid:48)(t − 4τ ))R(cid:126)z(π),

(20)

where ϑ0 = −1.416 and κ(cid:48) = −0.031 for ¯A(cid:48) = −167.4µeV
and A(cid:48) = 16.5µeV. This represents a σx rotation of angle
ϑ0 + κ(cid:48)(t − 4τ ) together with an additional π rotation
around the σz axis. This additional rotation can be cor-
rected either by performing the qubit operation twice or
by relabelling the qubit states ψ0(x) → ψ0(x), ψ1(x) →
−ψ1(x).

Establishing this type of rotation for an experimental
DQD is straightforward. Using the technique for readout
of the optimal qubit described in Sec. IV we can relate
the measured probability with the qubit coeﬃcients, and
therefore identify values of A(cid:48) and ¯A(cid:48) that give the largest
oscillation amplitude. Once the values of A(cid:48) and ¯A(cid:48) are
determined, the parameters ϑ and κ(cid:48) can be found by
measuring the resulting probability for the shortest pulse
(for tp = 4τ ) and the oscillation frequency, respectively.

C.

σz rotations

We applied a similar procedure to ﬁnd optimal pulse
parameters for performing a σz rotation on the Bloch
sphere. Again, the trapezoidal pulse was not able to gen-
erate a pure σz rotation. To show this, we initialised
the qubit in the ψ0(x) state and performed a parameter
sweep for a trapezoidal pulse with a maximum possible
detuning of Amax = 200µeV, i.e. within the range given
in Fig. 2. Again, transient rotations dominated these
operations and it was not possible to obtain a rotation
where the oscillation amplitude between the qubits was
not less than 25% (a high ﬁdelity σz rotation only intro-
duces a phase diﬀerence, thus there should be no change
in the amplitude). Therefore, we again tried the modiﬁed
pulse from Sec. III B (Fig. 4 (b)) and used the sweep from
Fig. 5, this time focusing on the regions with the low-
est amplitude. As a result, we were able to successfully
ﬁnd a qubit operation where the oscillation amplitude
was small (less than 0.003). Once again, we mapped out
the operation using the set of three mutually orthogonal
eigenstates and found a rotation around the σz axis of
the Bloch sphere with the form:

R(t) = R(cid:126)z(ϑ(cid:48)

0 + κ(cid:48)(cid:48)(t − 4τ )),

(21)

For our system, ϑ(cid:48)
0 = 2.658 and κ(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0.359 with
pulse detunings ¯A = −181.2µeV and A = 177.0µeV.
It is worth noting that, as opposed to standard Ram-
sey interferometry-type experiments, this σz rotation is
achieved using a single pulse without the need for addi-
tional π pulses around the perpendicular (σx) axis [32].

Similarly to the approach discussed in Sec. III B, the
values for A(cid:48) and ¯A(cid:48) can be found by relating the mea-
sured probability with the qubit coeﬃcients, as described
in Sec. IV.

IV. READOUT

In experimental setups, it is the probability of ﬁnding
the electron in one of the dots which is measured rather
than the qubit superposition weighting coeﬃcients. We
can write both qubits deﬁned in Sec.
II B in terms of
their right and left dots parts:

ψ0(x) = f0L(x) + f0R(x)
ψ1(x) = f1L(x) + f1R(x)

(22)
(23)

Because the qubits ψ0(x) and ψ1(x) are orthogonal and
also there is no overlap between any left and right dots

wavefunction parts, we have:

0 =

(cid:90)

f∗
0R(x)f1R(x)dx =

(cid:90)

(24)

The qubits are mirror images of each other, such that
ψ0(x) has the same spatial distribution in the left (right)
dot as ψ1(x) has in the right (left) one. Therefore eq. 24
implies that:

f∗
0L(x)f1L(x)dx =

f∗
0R(x)f1R(x)dx = 0.

(25)

(cid:90)

Any arbitrary state can be written as a linear combina-
tion of the two qubits right and left dot components

(28)

where the integrals P0 and P1 can be obtained experi-
mentally by setting the qubit in the ψ0(x) or ψ1(x) state,
respectively, and measuring the probability of ﬁnding it
in the right dot. Combining eq. 28 with the normalisa-
tion condition for ψ(x):

|α|2 + |β|2 = 1

(29)
we obtain an equation relating |β| to the probability PR
of ﬁnding the particle in the right dot:

|β|2 =

PR − P0
P1 − P0

,

(30)

together with a similar expression for |α|. As a result,
the states ψ0(x) and ψ1(x) deﬁned in Sec. II are not

7

only optimal in terms of overlap with other states, but
they are also the most suitable states for charge-detection
readout as the probability weight of the particle being in
each dot can be directly related to the modulus-squared
of the weighting coeﬃcients of the qubit superposition
|α|2 and |β|2.

V. DISCUSSION

The rotations given in Eqs. 19–21 needed to be cal-
culated using three mutually-orthogonal eigenstates. As
discussed in Sec. IV, the state of a charge qubit can be
read-out by performing measurements of the probability
amplitude for ﬁnding the electron in one of the quantum
dots. However, in order to ﬁnd out which rotation has
been performed on a qubit for a given pulse sequence
requires tomography to be performed on more than one
initial state.

Taking the σx rotation studied in Sec. III B as an ex-
ample, if we initialise the qubit in the ψ0(x) state, then
an ideal rotation will result in the probability amplitude
for ﬁnding the electron in the right dot oscillating be-
tween its smallest and largest values as the length of the
pulse is increased. However, for a pulse with ﬁnite rise
times, a perfect oscillation of the electron from the left to
the right dot does not guarantee that the qubit operation
R(cid:126)n(ϑ) is a rotation around the x axis, ie. (cid:126)n (cid:54)= (cid:126)x.

The ﬁnite rise time induces a transient rotation which
can only be resolved by mapping the rotation completely
using three mutually-orthogonal eigenstates. If varying
a pulse parameter results in the path of the ﬁnal state
tracing out a rotation on the Bloch sphere, then it does
not mean that this is the rotation which the qubit has
experienced.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have described the optimal charge
qubits for a double-quantum dot system and presented
pulse sequences for state preparation and arbitrary qubit
rotation where the experimental response suﬀers from ﬁ-
nite rise times. We showed that, due to hybridisation of
the eigenstates in a double-dot system, the spatial wave
function of the two lowest energy eigenstates cannot be
conﬁned exclusively to the left and the right dot. The
qubits which have the greatest overlap to all other eigen-
states were found to be deﬁned in terms of the two lowest
energy eigenstates when the dots were on resonance. This
allowed us to reduce our model to a two-state system.

We showed that it is possible to prepare the qubit in
such a state when it is initially in the eigenstate of a DQD
with a non-zero detuning. With trapezoidal pulses it was
not possible to perform arbitrary qubit rotations when
the detuning pulses were subject to ﬁnite rise times due to
unwanted transient rotations. Using a pulse inspired by
spin-echo techniques, which included a counter-detuning

to correct the transient rotation, σx and σz rotations of
an arbitrary angle were possible. We also discussed how
the qubit state can be experimentally read-out and how
tomography of the qubit oscillation must be performed
with three mutually-orthogonal eigenstates for this DQD
system.

Appendix A: Iteration method

The system is modelled using an explicit itera-
tive scheme for the one-dimensional time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) with an arbitrary potential
V(x,t):

i ∂ψ(x, t)

∂t

= Hψ =

∂2
∂x2 + V (x, t)

ψ(x, t)

(A1)

(cid:20)−2

2m

(cid:21)

where m is the eﬀective mass. The scheme, which is
based on the ﬁnite diﬀerence method, was described in
details by Maestri et al. for two particles in one dimen-
sion [33] and we adapt it to a single particle. The wave-
function is evaluated on a spatially discretized grid and
at successive, equally separated intervals of time ∆t:

ψ(x, t) = ψ(m∆x, k∆t) ≡ ψk
m,

(A2)

with m, k integer. The spatial part of the method is
derived using Taylor expansion of the wavefunction:

∂2ψ

∆x2

∂x2 (cid:39) ψ(x + ∆x) − 2ψ(x) + ψ(x − ∆x)
(cid:19)

(cid:18) ψm+1 − 2ψm + ψm−1

(cid:34)−2

Therefore, using eq. (A2) and (A3), the right hand side
of eq. (A1) transforms into

(cid:35)

Hψ =

2m

∆x2

+ Vm

ψm.

(A4)

The derivative on the left hand side of eq. (A1) is cal-
culated by writing the exact solution of TDSE and then
taking the diﬀerence between the (k +1)th and (k−1)th
time steps, as suggested by Askar and Cakmak [22]:

Appendix B: GPU acceleration

To improve the accuracy, we follow Visscher’s staggered-
time method [34] and write the wavevector in terms of
its real and imaginary parts: ψk
m. After in-
serting the Hamiltonian from eq. (A4) into eq. (A6) and
rearranging the terms, we obtain a pair of simultaneous
equations, which are iterated over time:

m + ivk

m = uk

(cid:20)(cid:16)
(cid:20)(cid:16)

m = uk−1

where ax =
imaginary parts are calculated at slightly shifted times:
uk ≡ u(t), vk ≡ v(t + ∆t/2).

The method above is stable as long as the following

criterion is satisﬁed:

∆t ≤ 

Emax

(A8)

erations and the total electron probability (cid:80)

with Emax being the largest eigenvalue of the discretised
Hamiltonian [35]. Furthermore, small errors due to ﬁ-
nite computational accuracy do not accumulate with it-
m|2
all m |ψk
is preserved over time, showing no signiﬁcant deviations
from unity.

The scheme described in App. A is computationally
demanding. However, the set of deﬁning equations (A7)
can be parallelised in a straightforward manner: the next
value of an element at position (m) depends only on
its value two steps before and the previous values of its
neighbours at positions (m − 1) and (m + 1). Therefore,
each vector element can be calculated separately and the
whole procedure can be divided into a set of Nx simulta-
neous steps [23].

To further employ parallelism, calculations were trans-
ferred to GPUs, as graphics cards are excellent at ac-
celerating processes involving large numbers of smaller
jobs evaluated concurrently. In this case, these separate
tasks were the calculations for the next vector elements at
each node. Our code was written using OpenCL, which
provides a framework for writing programs that run on
arbitrary GPUs [36]. Comparison tests performed with
a single computer showed a performance improvement
of two orders of magnitude using GPU accelerated code
over CPU code.

[25] In practical implementations, measurement of the prob-
ability is taken at the end of the pulse where decoherence
does not yet aﬀect the amplitude. In our model, there is
no explicit inclusion of coherent mechanisms and so, the
speciﬁc time at which measurement is performed is less
critical.
