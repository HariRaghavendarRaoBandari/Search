Abstract

GRS 1747−312 is a neutron star Low-Mass X-ray Binary in the globular cluster Terzan 6, located
at a distance of 9.5 kpc from the Earth. During its outbursts, periodic eclipses were known to occur.
Observations for the outbursts were performed with Chandra in 2004 and Swift in 2013. XMM-Newton
observed its quiescent state in 2004. In addition, when Suzaku observed it in 2009 as a part of Galactic
center mapping observations, GRS 1747−312 was found to be in a low luminosity state with Lx ∼ 1.2× 1035
erg s−1. All of the observations except for XMM-Newton included the time of the eclipses predicted. We
analyzed archival data of these observations. During the Chandra and Swift observations, we found clear
ﬂux decreases at the expected time of the eclipses. During the Suzaku observation, however, there were
no clear signs for the predicted eclipses. The lapse of the predicted eclipses during the Suzaku observation
can be explained by a contaminant source quite close to GRS 1747−312. When GRS 1747−312 is in the
quiescent state, we observe X-rays from the contaminant source rather than from GRS 1747−312. However,
we have no clear evidence for the contaminant source in our data. The lapse might also be explained by
thick material (NH > 1024 cm−2 ) between the neutron star and the companion star, though the origin of
the thick material is not clear.

Introduction

Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are stellar systems

∼ 1M⊙)

consisting of a compact object and a low-mass (<
companion star. The companion star supplies gas onto
the compact star by Roche-lobe overﬂow. The accret-
ing matter releases the gravitational energy and then
emits X-rays. Many LMXBs exhibit large variability
in X-ray luminosity between 1032 − 1033 erg s−1 (quies-
cent state) and 1037 − 1038 erg s−1 (outburst state). So
far, more than 100 LMXBs have been identiﬁed in the
Galaxy (Liu et al. 2007). Among them, only six are known
to have clear X-ray eclipses: EXO 0748−676 (Wolﬀ et al.
2009), XTE J1710−281 (Jain & Paul 2011), X 1658−298
(Oosterbroek et al. 2001), AX J1745.6−2910 (Maeda et
al. 1996; Kennea & Skinner 1996), 4U 2129+47 (Lin et al.
2009) and GRS 1747−312 (this work). An eclipsing fea-
ture informs us of an accurate orbital period and a strong

limitation on an inclination angle of the system.

GRS 1747−312 is a transient X-ray source ﬁrstly de-
tected in 1990 with ROSAT (Predehl et al. 1991) and
Granat (Pavlinsky et al. 1994). The source is located
at (α, δ)J2000.0 = (267.◦69526, −31.◦27468) or (l, b) =
(358.◦57274, −2.◦16286). The position was determined
with the Chandra HRC-I with an uncertainty of 0.′′4
(in’t Zand et al. 2003). The position is coincident with
Terzan 6, which is a core-collapsed metal-rich globular
cluster (Barbuy et al. 1997). The distance to the cluster
is estimated to be 9.5+3.3
−2.5 kpc from the luminosity level of
the horizontal branch (Kuulkers et al. 2003). The compact
object in GRS 1747−312 is considered to be a neutron
star, since four type-I X-ray bursts from GRS 1747−312
were detected (in’t Zand et al. 2003). Assuming the dis-
tance for Terzan 6, the peak ﬂux of the type-I bursts was
consistent with the ﬂux of a neutron star at the Eddington
luminosity. Thus GRS 1747−312 is thought to belong to

the cluster.
In the HRC-I observation, no other X-ray
sources were detected in the cluster. The detection limit
of the observation was 1.3×10−13 erg cm−2 s−1 (in’t Zand
et al. 2003).
It is known that GRS 1747−312 exhibits recurrent X-
ray outbursts with an interval of about 130–142 days (in’t
Zand et al. 2003). Typical time scale of the decay of
the outbursts was ∼ 18 days. During the outburst,
BeppoSAX and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
observations found periodic eclipses with a duration of
2596 s. The authors claimed that the orbital period is
P = 0.514980303 days. The duration of the eclipse and
the orbital period indicate that the mass of the compan-
ion star is at least 0.1 M⊙ assuming a mass of 1.4 M⊙ for
the neutron star. Based on the typical age of a globular
cluster, the mass of the companion star is thought to be
lower than 0.8 M⊙ (in’t Zand et al. 2000).

An energy spectrum of GRS 1747−312 during the out-
burst obtained with BeppoSAX was investigated in in’t
Zand et al. (2000). No line-like structures were detected
in the energy range between 1 keV and 100 keV. The
spectrum was represented well by a two-component model
consisting of a blackbody and a Comptonized emission;
the blackbody temperature was kT = 1.78 keV, while the
Comptonized component has an electron temperature of
kTe = 5.4 keV, an optical depth of τ = 7.4, and a temper-
ature of seed emission of kTseed = 0.57 keV. The spectral
analysis demonstrated that the absorption column density
was approximately 1022 cm−2, which is consistent with the
value obtained from the interstellar reddening of Terzan 6
(in’t Zand et al. 2000; Predehl & Schmitt 1995).

Previous studies of GRS 1747−312, however, were con-
centrated on the outburst state. Thus the behavior out-
side the outbursts is still unclear. In this paper, we ana-
lyzed archival data of Chandra, XMM-Newton, Suzaku
and Swift to investigate physical properties in various
states. Detailed information on the observations is de-
scribed in section 2. Results on imaging, timing and spec-
tral analysis are reported in section 3. Discussions and
conclusions are given in sections 4 and 5, respectively. In
this paper, the uncertainties are at the 90% conﬁdence
level, while the errors on the data points of spectra, ra-
dial proﬁles, and light curves are at the 1σ level, unless
otherwise stated.

2. Observation and data reduction

2.1. Chandra

Chandra (Weisskopf et al. 2000) has an X-ray tele-
scope named High Resolution Mirror Assembly with an
angular resolution of 0.′′5. The telescope focuses X-rays
onto one of two kinds of instruments, Advanced CCD
Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS; Garmire et al. 2003) or
High Resolution Camera (HRC; Murray et al. 2000).
Chandra is equipped with two grating spectrometers, High
Energy Transmission Grating (HETG; Canizares et al.
2005) and Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG;
Brinkman et al. 2000); the HETG covers the energy range
of 0.4–10 keV and the LETG covers 0.07–0.2 keV.

GRS 1747−312 was observed twice with Chandra on
2000 March 9 (ObsID = 720) and on 2004 March 29
(ObsID = 4551). The observation in 2000 was published
by in’t Zand et al. (2003) to determine the source position
with the HRC. Thus, we focus on the data obtained from
the observation in 2004 hereafter. The observation was
conducted as a Target of Opportunity (ToO) to obtain
the data during the outburst, and it covered the time of
the eclipse (see section 3.2). The log of the observation is
summarized in table 1.

The observation was operated with the ACIS-S in the
Continuous Clocking (CC) mode. The ACIS-S contains
six X-ray CCD chips arranged in a 1 × 6 array, and each
chip has 1024 × 1024 pixels. The ﬁeld of view is 8.′3 ×
50.′6. In the CC mode, two-dimensional images cannot be
obtained, but a high time resolution of 2.85 ms can be
achieved. An energy resolution is 95 eV at 1.49 keV and
150 eV at 5.9 keV. During the observation, the HETG was
inserted between the telescope and the ACIS-S. We only
used the zeroth order image for our analysis.

We analyzed the primary event data processed with

Standard Data Processing pipeline Version DS
8.4 with a software package CIAO version 4.6 and a
relevant calibration database (CALDB version 4.6.1.1).

2.2. XMM-Newton

GRS 1747−312 (a.k.a. 1RXS J175046.5−311632) was
observed with XMM-Newton in 2004 September 28.
XMM-Newton (Jansen et al. 2001) enables us to conduct
imaging spectroscopy in the 0.3–10 keV band, utilizing the
X-ray telescopes (Aschenbach et al. 2000) and the focal
plane detectors called European Photon Imaging Camera
(EPIC). EPIC consists of two types of X-ray CCDs: Metal
Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) CCDs (Turner et al. 2001)
and pn CCDs (Str¨uder et al. 2001). There are two MOS
detectors (MOS1 and MOS2). The EPIC cameras were
operated with the medium ﬁlter in the full-frame mode in
this observation. The total exposure time were 8.2 ks for
pn and 14.3 ks for each MOS detector.

We reprocessed the Observation Data Files provided
by the XMM-Newton Science Archive with epchain and
emchain, using appropriate calibration data. We then
used the Science Analysis Software (SAS, version 13.0)
to make images, light curves and spectra. In order to ex-
cise ﬂaring particle backgrounds mainly caused by parti-
cles such as soft protons, we ﬁltered out the reprocessed
event ﬁles, following the instruction in the XMM data
reduction guide1. We made X-ray light curves of sin-
gle events (PATTERN = 0) in the 10–12 keV band for pn
and above 10 keV for MOS1/2. The events were accumu-
lated from the entire ﬁeld of view of each detector. The
good time intervals were selected so that the count rates
are smaller than 0.4 cts s−1 for pn or 0.35 cts s−1 for
MOS1/2. We found that the observation was little af-
fected by the background ﬂares: the screened live times
for pn and MOS1/2 were 8.2 ks and 14.2 ks, respectively.

In the following analysis, we used the screened event data.
The observation log is summarized in table 1.

with the Photon Counting (PC) mode. The observation
logs are also summarized in table 1.

2.3. Suzaku

GRS 1747−312 was also observed with Suzaku
(Mitsuda et al. 2007) in 2009 September 16. The observa-
tion was performed as a part of the mapping observation
of the Galactic center region. The information on the
Suzaku observation is also given in table 1.

One of the main instruments of Suzaku is the X-ray
Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) consists of four sets of CCD
cameras (XIS0-3) (Koyama et al. 2007). Each CCD
chip is placed on the focal plane of the X-Ray Telescope
(XRT; Serlemitsos et al. 2007). XIS0, 2 and 3 are front-
illuminated (FI) CCDs, while XIS1 is a back-illuminated
(BI) CCD. Since XIS2 suﬀered serious damage, it has not
been usable since 2006 November 9. In this observation,
the XIS was operated in the normal clocking mode with
the Spaced-row Charge Injection (SCI; Uchiyama et al.
2009). Suzaku also has the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD
; Takahashi et al. 2007). The HXD consists of Si-PIN
photo diodes and GSO scintillators. Although the HXD
is a non-imaging detector, the PIN and GSO provide us
X-ray spectra covering the energy ranges of 10–70 keV
and 40–600 keV, respectively. The HXD was operated in
the normal mode in this observation.

We analyzed the cleaned event data processed with
the processing version of 2.4.12.27. In this process,
the data taken at the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) and
low elevation angles of < 5 deg from the night-earth rim
and < 20 deg from the day-earth rim were excluded. The
net exposure time was 45.3 ks for the XIS and 45.6 ks for
the HXD. To analyze the data, we used the software pack-
age HEAsoft version 6.12, and the relevant calibration
database (CALDB). We generated the redistribution ma-
trix ﬁles (RMFs) and ancillary response ﬁles (ARFs) by
xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen (Ishisaki et al. 2007).

2.4. Swift

On 2013 March 11, INTEGRAL/JEM-X (Lund et al.
2003) detected a burst from GRS 1747−312 (Chenevez et
al. 2013). Soon after the detection, Monitor of All-sky
X-ray Image (MAXI; Matsuoka et al. 2009) on board the
International Space Station (ISS) gave a transient alert
on March 112. Subsequently, two ToO observations were
performed with Swift on March 18 and March 24. The
exposure for each observation was ∼ 1 ks. The 2nd obser-
vation was planned to observe the predicted ingress of the
eclipse.

We used Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT) data of these ob-
servations. Swift XRT (Gehrels et al. 2004) consists of an
X-ray telescope and a single X-ray CCD (600× 602 pixel),
which covers the 0.2–10 keV energy band. The CCD
has the same design with that of the EPIC MOS instru-
ments of XMM-Newton. The size of the ﬁeld of view is
23.′6× 23.′6. In these observations, the XRT was operated

2 http://maxi.riken.jp/pipermail/x-ray-star/2013-

March/000210.html

We analyzed the cleaned event data which were gener-
ated by the Swift Data Center (SDC) processing. We used
the HEAsoft version 6.16 to analyze the Swift XRT
data. Also, we used a relevant calibration database (CALDB
Version 1.8).

3. Analysis and results

3.1.

Image

Although only GRS 1747−312 were detected in Terzan
6 during the HRC observation, there may be other tran-
sient X-ray sources in the cluster because of the high num-
ber density of the stellar objects. Thus, in this section, we
analyzed X-ray images of the observations to investigate
whether only GRS 1747−312 is visible or not. Then we
deﬁned source and background regions for the following
light curve and spectral analyses.
3.1.1. Chandra

Since the ACIS was operated in the CC mode, only a
one-dimensional image which is parallel to the long axis
of the ACIS-S can be obtained. A peak of the bright-
ness was seen near the center of the image. Since the
image rotated only by 2.◦4 clockwise from the north di-
rection, we can study the position of the peak only along
the declination axis. A count proﬁle along the declination
axis in the 0.5–10 keV band binned with 0.′′28 is shown in
ﬁgure 1. The origin of the horizontal axis is set to the po-
sition of GRS 1747−312, Dec. = −31.◦27468, given by the
Chandra HRC observation (in’t Zand et al. 2003). We ﬁt-
ted the proﬁle between ±1′′ with a Gaussian function and
found that the peak position is δDec. = +0.′′208± 0.′′001.
Since the 90% uncertainty circle of the Chandra X-ray
absolute position has a radius of 0.′′6 (Weisskopf et al.
2003), the peak position is consistent with the position
of GRS 1747−312. The width of the Gaussian function
was σ = 0.′′353 ± 0.′′001. We simulated a proﬁle of a point
source with MARX (Davis et al.
2012). The width of
a Gaussian function ﬁtted to the simulated proﬁle was
σ = 0.′′358. A possibility of a spatially extended source or
multiple objects is thus rejected. Though we could not
study the image along the right ascension axis, the ob-
served source seems consistent with GRS 1747−312.
In the following analysis, we extracted source photons
from −5′′ to +5′′ in the proﬁle (see ﬁgure 1). Also, back-
ground events were extracted from regions between −25′′
and −15′′ and between +15′′ and +25′′.

3.1.2. XMM-Newton

Figure 2 shows an X-ray image in the 0.5–10 keV band
obtained with the XMM-Newton pn. The image was
smoothed with a Gaussian function of σ = 2 pixels.

We found several sources in all pn, MOS1, and MOS2
images. Seven sources used later for the astrometry of
the Suzaku image are indicated with green circles in ﬁg-
ure 2. We designated them as Sources 1–7 hereafter.
These sources were tagged as point sources by the source
detection tool in the SAS, emldetect. Their positions are
listed in table 2. The statistical error on the Source 1 posi-

tion is 0.′′7, and Source 1 is coincident with GRS 1747−312
within an attitude uncertainty of XMM-Newton (3–4′′)3.
Source 1 can thus be regarded as GRS 1747−312.
We deﬁned a source region as a circle with a radius
of 60′′ centered on GRS 1747−312. The source region is
shown as the white solid circle in ﬁgure 2. A background
region was deﬁned as its surrounding annulus with inner
and outer radii of 100′′ and 130′′. The center of the annu-
lus is the same as that of the circle of the source region.
3.1.3. Suzaku

X-ray images in the 0.5–10 keV band were obtained
with XIS0, 1, and 3. Since an X-ray source at the center
of the images exhibited a burst and a dip-like behavior
in the X-ray light curve as described in section 3.2, we
excluded the durations of the burst and dip to create the
XIS images. The images of XIS0, 1, and 3 were combined,
and binned with 8 × 8 pixels.
All seven sources in table 2 can be seen in the
Suzaku image. We then checked the astrometry between
the Suzaku and XMM-Newton observations using these

sources. We made projection proﬁles of these sources
along the right ascension and declination axes from the
Suzaku image. These proﬁles were ﬁtted with a Gaussian
function plus a constant component to determine the peak
positions. Since Sources 4 and 5 were too faint to ﬁt with
the Gaussian function, we deﬁned the pixel position hav-
ing the largest count as the position of these sources. We
found that the Suzaku positions were shifted on average by
−1.′′1 along the right ascension axis and by +10.′′0 along
the declination axis. We then corrected the coordinates
of the Suzaku image by these amounts. The Suzaku im-
age thus obtained is shown in ﬁgure 3, and the source
positions are listed in table 2.

The Suzaku position of Source 1 is coincident with
GRS 1747−312 within the Suzaku attitude uncertainty
of ∼ 19” (Uchiyama et al. 2008). The radial proﬁle of
Source 1 was ﬁtted with a point spread function extracted
from the Suzaku data of SS Cyg. The proﬁle is consistent

0.5–10 keV band after the coordinate correction as de-
scribed in the text. X-ray events during the burst and dip
were not used. Regions illuminated by the 55Fe calibra-
tion sources were removed. The image was binned with
8 × 8 pixels and then smoothed with a Gaussian function
of σ = 2 bins. The color bar at the bottom of the im-
age is in unit of photons per binned pixel. The solid circle
and the dashed annulus indicate the source and background
regions. Green circles shows the sources listed in table 2.

with the point spread function with χ2/ν = 1.12 (ν = 294),
where ν represents the degree of freedom in the ﬁtting.
Thus Source 1 can be regarded as GRS 1747−312.
Source 5 was located ∼ 3′ away from GRS 1747−312 in
the south-west direction, and we deﬁned a source region as
a circle with a radius of 2.′3 centered on GRS 1747−312 to
avoid the contamination from source 5. The background
events were extracted from an annulus with inner and
outer radii of 4.′27 and 6.′45. Since Sources 2, 6 and 7
were located in the background region, we excluded X-ray
photons within circles with a radius of 0.′78, centered on
these sources. These regions are plotted as dashed circles
in ﬁgure 3.

3.1.4. Swift

Figures 4a and 4b show X-ray images in the 0.5–10 keV
band obtained with the Swift XRT during the 1st and
2nd observations, respectively. The images were binned
with 2 × 2 pixels. Since there was a sudden decrease in
the ﬂux during the 2nd observation (see section 3.2.4), we
ﬁltered out the interval of the low-ﬂux state to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio. In both images, the brightness
peak was located near the center of the ﬁeld of view.

To determine the position of the X-ray source, we
made projection proﬁles along the right ascension and
declination axes, and then ﬁtted the proﬁles with a
Gaussian function. The projection proﬁle of the 1st ob-
servation along the declination axis obtained from the
green rectangular region in ﬁgure 4a is shown in ﬁg-
ure 5. The proﬁle within ±10′′ looks suppressed. The
suppression was also seen in the 2nd observation. This
is because of the pile-up eﬀect, since the X-ray source
was too bright (> 2 cts s−1). Although the proﬁles
were not fully reproduced with a simple Gaussian func-
tion, the Gaussian ﬁttings gave the source position as
(RA, Dec)J2000.0 = (267.◦6964, −31.◦2741) for the 1st ob-
servation and (267.◦6955, −31.◦2748) for the 2nd obser-
vation. These values are coincident with the position of
GRS 1747−312 within the ﬁtting error (∼ 1′′) and posi-
tional uncertainties of Swift (∼ 3′′)4. Hence, we consider
the X-ray source detected with the Swift XRT as GRS
1747−312.
We found an X-ray source at almost the same posi-
tion as GRS 1747−312 even during the low-ﬂux state
in the 2nd observation. However, the statistics were
too poor to do the above analysis. The pixel posi-
tion with the maximum counts was (RA, Dec)J2000.0 =
(267.◦6925,−31.◦2767). There was no signiﬁcant change
of the position from that during the high-ﬂux state.
For the light curves and spectral analyses described in
the following sections, we deﬁned a source region as an
annulus with an outer radius of 1.′5 centered on the po-
sition of GRS 1747−312. A circular region with a radius
of 10′′ was excluded from the source region to remove the
pileup events. A background region was deﬁned as an
annulus with inner and outer radii of 1.′5 and 3.′0. The
center of the annulus was the same as that of the source

GRS 1747−312 was calculated as MJD 52066.259473(5) +

0.514980303(7)n for egress (n is an integer). Based on
the ephemeris, the ingress and egress of eclipse were pre-
dicted at MJD 53094.16016 and 53094.19020 during the
Chandra observation, respectively, which are shown with
the dashed lines in ﬁgure 6. Both of the observed ingress
and egress were coincident with the predicted time within
∼ 10 s. Averaged count rates outside and during the
eclipse were 5.43 ± 0.02 cts s−1 and 0.05 ± 0.01 cts s−1,
respectively. In this estimation, time intervals of 30 s be-
fore and after the ingress and egress were neglected to
exclude the transition phases.

time origin of the plot was MJD 53093.96450. Dashed

shows the background-subtracted light curve where the
bin size is 192 s. The origin of the light curve is
MJD 55090.30904 in TBD. We can see ﬂuctuations of the
count rate in the light curve. Also a remarkable drop and
a burst were seen at around ∼ 57 ks and ∼ 64 ks, respec-
tively. The burst lasted for a few hours. The detailed
analysis and discussion on the burst is reported in Iwai et
al. (2014).

During the drop, the combined count rate of XIS0 + 3
was 0.025± 0.026 cts s−1. We could not observe the start
and end of the drop due to the Earth occultation or the
SAA passage. The upper and lower limits for the duration
of the drop were 8296 s and 1368 s, respectively. Some
dips are reported in in’t Zand et al. (2003). However,
the duration of the dipping activity was ∼ 50 s, which is
quite shorter than that of the drop observed with Suzaku.
The averaged count rate excluding the burst and drop was
0.425 ± 0.005 cts s−1.
During the Suzaku observation, two eclipses were pre-
dicted, from MJD 55090.73879 to 55090.76884 and from
55091.25377 to 55091.28382. The expected times of the
ingresses and egresses are shown with dashed lines in the
zoomed up light curve (ﬁgure 8). Arrows in the ﬁgure
show the predicted intervals of the eclipses. Due to both
the Earth occultation and the SAA passage, only the ﬁrst
288 s and 1464 s of the predicted intervals were observed.
In contrast to the previous researches and our Chandra
result in section 3.2.1, no large decrease in the count
rate was seen during the both predicted eclipses. The
count rates were 0.14± 0.04 cts s−1 in the ﬁrst predicted
eclipse and 0.30± 0.03 cts s−1 in the second one. On the
other hand, the count rate in an interval of 288 s just
before the ﬁrst ingress was 0.25 ± 0.06 cts s−1, and that
of 1464 s just before the second ingress was 0.45 ± 0.03
cts s−1. The count rates during the predicted eclipses are
thus lower than the count rates before the eclipses. The

low count rates might suggest that weak eclipses were ob-
served. However, the average duration of the transition
for ingress was 27.3± 0.8 s, and the mid point of the tran-
sition occurred within +1.8 s/−2.5 s from the predicted
time (in’t Zand et al. 2003). The prediction about the
time of the transition mid point could be aﬀected by the
change of the orbital period and the uncertainty of the or-
˙P /P was estimated to be
bital period. The upper limit of
1×10−16 s−1 at MJD 52066.259477 (in’t Zand et al. 2003).
GRS 1747-312 had completed 5873 revolutions since then,
and the change of the orbital period could aﬀect the pre-
dicted times of the mid points by 3.4 s at most. The uncer-
tainty of the orbital preiod is 7× 10−9 d = 6× 10−4 s (in’t
Zand et al. 2003). After the 5873 revolutions, the accumu-
lation of the uncertainty could change the predicted time
of the mid points by 3.6s at most. Thus the mid point
of the transition should be coincident with the prediction
within +8.8 s/−9.5 s. The Suzaku light curve does not
show these characteristics clearly. Note that the count
rate during the Suzaku observation was highly ﬂuctuated.
Figure 9 shows a histogram of the count rate excluding the
burst, drop, and the durations of the predicted eclipses.
The count rate sometimes became lower than that dur-
ing the interval of the eclipses. Thus the low count rates
during the predicted eclipses can be explained by the ﬂuc-
tuation, though the weak eclipse cannot be fully rejected.

where H and S represent the count rates in the 4–10 keV
and 0.5–4 keV band, respectively. The bin size was ad-
justed so that ∼ 1500 photons in the 0.5–10 keV band
were included in each bin. During the ﬁrst ∼ 30 ks of

small with < 0.1 cts s−1. The count rate then increased
to >
∼ 0.1 cts s−1. On the other hand, the count rate in
the 4–10 keV band was relatively stable. As a result, the
hardness ratio decreased.

We divided the observation time into two intervals, des-
ignated as A and B, with the dotted line in ﬁgure 7. The
time of the drop and the burst was removed from inter-
val B. During interval A, the hardness ratio generally ex-
ceeded 4, while the hardness ratio decreased and then kept
constant at ∼ 3 during interval B.

Figure 10 shows the background-subtracted light curves
in the 0.5–10 keV band of each observation. The curves

are plotted in TDB and binned with 15 s. The time origins
of these curves are MJD 56369.87667 and 56375.09391,
respectively.

During the 1st observation, the light curve had no re-
markable structure. The averaged count rate was 1.85±
0.07 cts s−1. During the 2nd observation, on the other
hand, a sudden decrease in the count rate was seen at
∼ 500 s. The 2nd observation covered the time of the
predicted ingress of the eclipse at MJD 56375.09967 (in’t
Zand et al. 2003), which is shown with the dashed line in
ﬁgure 10. Thus the sudden decrease was coincident with
the expected time of the ingress. Averaged count rates
before and after the decrease were 1.8 ± 0.1 cts s−1 and
0.10 ± 0.03 cts s−1, respectively.

3.3. Spectrum

3.3.1. Chandra

We investigated the spectrum outside the eclipse to
know the properties during the outburst. We extracted
the ACIS spectra from the source and background regions.
Figure 11 (a) shows the background subtracted spectrum
in the 0.5–10 keV band. We binned the spectrum so as to
contain at least 10 photons in each bin.

In the spectrum, no clear line-like features were seen.
Then we tried to describe the spectrum with an absorbed
power-law model, where the ”phabs” model in the spec-
tral ﬁtting package XSPEC (Arnaud 1996) was used for
the absorption model. This model adopts the cross sec-
tions of Balucinska-Church & McCammon (1992) with the
solar abundance of Anders & Grevesse (1989). The re-
sult of the ﬁtting was not acceptable with χ2/ν = 1.49
(ν = 634). Figure 11 (b) shows the residuals between the
data and the best-ﬁtted single power-law model. There
are large residuals below ∼ 3 keV. Neither a blackbody
model (χ2/ν = 8.26) nor a disk blackbody model (Mitsuda
et al. 1984; Makishima et al. 1986) (χ2/ν = 2.47) can de-
scribe the spectrum.

Then we examined several two-components models
which are usually used to represent spectra of LMXBs.
First, we attempted to ﬁt the data with a model which
consists of a disk blackbody component and a blackbody
component from the surface of the neutron star. The re-
sult of the ﬁtting was not acceptable with χ2/ν = 1.25
(ν = 632). Second, we tried a model consisting of a
disk blackbody and a Comptonized emission, assuming
that only the photons from the surface of the neutron
star are Comptonized. We used the ”CompTT” model
in XSPEC (Titarchuk 1994) to describe the Comptonized
emission. In this Comptonization model, a spherical dis-
tribution was assumed for the Comptonizing hot plasma.
This model was not rejected with χ2/ν = 1.15 (ν = 630).
The best-ﬁt parameters were the following: the absorption
column density NH = 1.13± 0.06× 10−22 cm−2, the tem-
perature at the inner disk radius kTin = 1.0+0.2
−0.1 keV, the
temperature of the seed photons for the Comptonization
kTseed = 0.61+0.04
−0.03 keV, the temperature of the electrons
for the Comptonization kTe = 8+7
−2 keV, and the plasma
optical depth τ = 12 ± 2. Then we tested a ”blackbody
in which only the photons from
+ CompTT” model,

the accretion disk are Comptonized. Since the electron
temperature for the Comptonization was not sensitive in
the ﬁtting, we ﬁxed the value to that in the previous
work, kTe = 5.4 keV (in’t Zand et al. 2000). This model
was also not rejected with χ2/ν = 1.11 (ν = 631). The
best-ﬁt parameters are summarized in table 3. We also
checked the model that both of the surface of the neu-
tron star and the accretion disk supply seed photons to
the same Comptonizing hot plasma. Since this model
was also not sensitive to the electron temperature, we
ﬁxed kTe to 5.4 keV. The model was not rejected with
χ2/ν = 1.18 (ν = 630). We obtained the best-ﬁt param-
eters as NH = 0.94 ± 0.03 × 10−22 cm−2, kTseed(disk) =
0.69+0.02
−0.06 keV and
τ < 1.2. Thus the last three models cannot be distin-
guished in terms of the statistics. Since the ”blackbody
+ CompTT” model was applied for the GRS 1747−312
spectrum obtained with BeppoSAX in the 0.5–100 keV
band in in’t Zand et al. (2000), we mainly investigate
the model hereafter. Figures 11 (a) and (c) show the
best-ﬁt model and the residuals between the data and
model, respectively. The absorption column density of
NH = (0.99 ± 0.03) × 1022 cm−2 was slightly lower than
that for Terzan 6, NH = (1.2 ± 0.1) × 1022 cm−2, which
was estimated via interstellar reddening (Barbuy et al.
1997; Predehl & Schmitt 1995).

−0.03 keV, kTseed(neutron star) = 2.28+0.09

Next we studied a spectrum during the eclipse (ﬁg-
ure 12). The spectrum was binned so that each bin has
at least 10 photons. We tried to ﬁt the spectrum with
an absorbed CompTT model. Similar to the ﬁtting for
the spectrum outside the eclipse, the electron tempera-
ture of the CompTT model was ﬁxed to 5.4 keV. The
absorption was also ﬁxed to the value outside the eclipse,
NH = 0.99 × 1022 cm−2. The ﬁtting was acceptable with
χ2/ν = 0.78 (ν = 15). The best-ﬁt model and residuals
are shown in ﬁgure 12, and the best-ﬁt parameters are
summarized in table 3. There were no signiﬁcant changes
in the CompTT parameters, except for the normalization,

gle component models such as a blackbody or power-law
could also describe the spectrum. The ﬂux declined by a
factor of (1.0 ± 0.2) × 10−2 compared to the ﬂux outside
the eclipse.

resented by black, red and green, respectively. The best–
ﬁt blackbody (dashed) + CompTT (dash-dotted) model is
also shown, where the column densities for the two compo-
nents are diﬀerent (see the text). (b) Residuals between the
data and the best-ﬁt single CompTT model. (c) Residuals
between the data and the blackbody + CompTT model.

spectra of XIS0, 1 and 3 were simultaneously ﬁtted with
an absorbed CompTT model. Here we introduced con-
stant factors, by which the normalization of each sensor
was multiplied, to mitigate the uncertainties of the XIS
calibration. The ﬁt was not acceptable with χ2/ν = 1.26
(ν = 187). Signiﬁcant residuals below 2 keV can be seen
in ﬁgure 15 (b). The existence of a soft component is
shown by the Suzaku spectra as well as the Chandra and
XMM-Newton spectra.

Then we tried to ﬁt the Suzaku spectra with the black-
body + CompTT model. We assumed that the elec-
tron temperature of the Comptonization is 5.4 keV as
in the case of the Chandra and XMM-Newton spectra.
If we assumed the same absorption for the two compo-
nents, the ﬁt was acceptable with χ2/ν = 0.98 (ν = 185).
The best-ﬁt parameters of the blackbody component were

−0.01 keV, NH = 7.1+1.4

kT = 0.07+0.02
−1.1 × 1022 cm−2. However,
the lower limit of the bolometric luminosity of the black-
body component was 1.0 × 1039 erg s−1, which is signiﬁ-
cantly larger than the Eddington luminosity for a 1.4M⊙
neutron star, ∼ 3 × 1038 erg s−1.
The model was then modiﬁed so that each component
suﬀers diﬀerent absorption, given by ”phabs1 × blackbody
+ phabs2 × CompTT”. We ﬁxed the column density for
the blackbody component to the Galactic value NH,BB =
1.2× 1022 cm−2, since if we set the absorption to be free,
only an upper limit was obtained. This model can describe
the spectrum with χ2/ν = 0.91 (ν = 185). The results of
the ﬁtting are summarized in ﬁgures 15 (a) and (c) and
table 5.

Secondly, the spectrum of interval B was analyzed. The
spectrum also could not be ﬁtted with a single-component
model such as a blackbody or a CompTT model. Thus
we tried the absorbed blackbody + CompTT model where
the column densities for the two components were diﬀerent
as in the case of interval A. The spectrum of interval B was
well described with this model with χ2/ν = 1.13 (ν = 241).
The results of the ﬁtting are summarized in ﬁgure 16
and table 5. Similar to interval A, the CompTT com-
ponent was strongly absorbed with a column density of
∼ 1023 cm−2.
Finally, we simultaneously ﬁtted the spectra of intervals
A and B with the blackbody + CompTT model. The fact
that both spectra are quite similar to each other above
∼ 5 keV (ﬁgure 14) suggests that both spectrum can be
explained by the same CompTT model, but they require
a diﬀerent blackbody component.
In this case, the ﬁt
was acceptable with χ2/ν = 1.06 (ν = 420). The best-ﬁt
parameters are summarized in table 5.

The absorption column density of NH ∼ 1023 cm−2 was
much higher than the value obtained from the spectrum
during the Type-I burst, 1.46 × 1022 cm−2 (Iwai et al.
2014). Thus we investigated the lower limits of the column
density for several spectral models. When we ﬁtted the
spectrum of interval A with the ”blackbody + CompTT”
model with a free kTe value, a lower limit of the absorption

column density of 7.6×1022 cm−2 was obtained when kTe
was 2.4 keV. We also tested the spectrum model of ”black-
body + blackbody”, then we obtained the lower limit of
NH = 7.8 × 1022 cm−2. Thus we concluded that the ab-
sorption column density during the Suzaku observation
was signiﬁcantly higher than the interstellar absorption,
independent on the spectral ﬁtting models.

We also investigated the HXD PIN spectrum, but the
spectrum turned out to be signiﬁcantly contaminated by
another bright source as described in appendix. Thus the
HXD data are not used in this paper.
3.3.4. Swift

The XRT spectra of the 1st and 2nd observations out-
side the eclipse are shown in ﬁgure 17. To obtain the
spectrum of the 2nd observation, only the data until 30 s
before the predicted ingress were used. The shapes of the
two spectra are quite similar to each other, and we si-
multaneously analyzed the spectra to increase the photon
statistics.

We tried to describe the spectra with the blackbody
+ CompTT model. All parameters except for the nor-
malizations were ﬁxed to the values obtained from the
Chandra analysis (table 3). The ratio between the nor-
malizations of blackbody and of CompTT was ﬁxed to the
value of the Chandra result. The ﬁt was acceptable with
χ2/ν = 1.11 (ν = 50). The observed ﬂux was decreased
from the Chandra ﬂux by a factor of 0.86 ± 0.04 for the
1st observation and 0.69 ± 0.04 for the 2nd observation.
The spectrum during the eclipse has too low statistics
to be studied in detail. If we applied the same model as
that ﬁtted to the spectrum outside the eclipse, the ﬂux in
the 0.5–10 keV band was (5.1± 1.9)× 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1.
This value is lower than that outside the eclipse by a factor
of (1.6 ± 0.6) × 10−2.

4. Discussion

4.1. Long-term variation of the X-ray ﬂux

Figure 18 shows the plot of the observed ﬂux in the 2.0–
10 keV band obtained in the Section 3.3. The BeppoSAX
result (in’t Zand et al. 2000) is also plotted. The ﬂux
outside and during the eclipses are shown separately.

is

We can see that the ﬂux of the outburst phase
outside the eclipses
roughly constant at ∼ 5 ×
10−10 erg cm−2 s−1. The ﬂux during the eclipses is
also constant at ∼ 10−11 erg cm−2 s−1. Thus the ﬂux
during the eclipses is usually ∼ 2 % of that outside the
eclipses. However, when the XMM-Newton observed,
the ﬂux decreased further to 2.7 × 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1.
GRS 1747−312 thus shows large variability even outside
the outburst phase.

4.2. Predicted eclipses and observations

Both of the Chandra and Swift light curves show in-
gresses at the predicted time, MJD 53094.16016 (n =
1996) and MJD 56375.09967 (n = 8367), respectively. In
the Chandra light curve, an egress was also detected at
MJD 53094.19020 (n = 1996). Even during these eclipses,
X-rays were observed. The ratio of the ﬂux compared
to that outside the eclipse was ∼ 2 × 10−2. Such ﬂux de-
tected even during eclipses was reported in other eclipsing
LMXBs; 2.7 ± 1.0 % for X 1658−298 (Oosterbroek et al.
2001) and 5–10 % for EXO 0748−676 (Bonnet-Bidaud et
al. 2001; Homan et al. 2003).
During the Suzaku observation, two eclipses were pre-
dicted from MJD 55090.73879 to MJD 55090.76882 (n =
5873) and from MJD 55091.25378 to MJD 55051.28380
(n = 5874). However, no ﬂux drops were seen during the
predicted times as shown with dashed lines in ﬁgure 8.
One may argue that the time stamped on the Suzaku data
was incorrect. We conﬁrmed that the decrease of the XIS
count rate of unscreened data exactly synchronized with
the SAA passages and Earth occultations which were cal-
culated from the satellite orbit and attitude. We thus
veriﬁed the time stamped on the XIS data, and the van-
ishing of the eclipsing event is not an artifact.

Suzaku observed the sudden drop of the ﬂux at around
60 ks in ﬁgure 7, just before the type-I burst. One may
argue that the orbital phase would have been changed for
some reasons and the drop could be the eclipse. However,
the Swift observation, which was conducted after the
Suzaku observation, conﬁrmed that the eclipse occurred
at the predicted time.
It is reasonable to consider that
the drop of the ﬂux was diﬀerent from the eclipse event.
Even though the ﬂux did not change at the predicted
ingresses, some other properties might change. We then
checked the position of Source 1 during the second pre-
dicted eclipse around 83 ks in ﬁgure 8. The diﬀerence of
the positions between outside and during the eclipse was
(∆α, ∆δ) = (+1.′′4 ± 1.′′0, +0.′′2+1.
−1.′′2). On the other hand,
the root mean square of the ﬂuctuation of the Suzaku
pointing direction during this observation was 8.′′9 along
the right ascension axis, and 5.′′0 along the declination
axis. Thus there was no signiﬁcant deference between the
source positions during and outside the eclipse. We also
checked the spectrum. Figure 19 shows the XIS1 spec-
trum obtained during the predicted second eclipse (ﬁlled
circles) and that after the predicted egress (open circles),
which corresponds to 85–90 ks in ﬁgure 8. We see no sig-
niﬁcant change in the spectra. We found that both spec-
tra can be described by the blackbody + CompTT model
with the same parameters as those listed in the column of
“Independent ﬁt, Interval B” in table 5. Thus neither the
Suzaku image nor spectrum showed a change coincident
with the predicted eclipse.

been observed only during the outburst state. One of
the possibilities to explain the lapse of the clear eclipse

with XIS1. Ratio of the spectrum outside the eclipse to
that during the eclipse is shown in the lower panel.

in the Suzaku observation is that there is a contami-
nant X-ray source quite close to GRS 1747−312. When
GRS 1747−312 is not in the outburst state, observed
X-rays originate in the contaminant source rather than
GRS 1747−312. When GRS 1747−312 is in the outburst
state, we can see the eclipse event, and the remaining
X-ray ﬂux during the eclipse is due to the contaminant
source. This scenario can explain why the X-ray ﬂux dur-
ing the eclipse is close to that observed with Suzaku (ﬁg-
ure 18). Based on the X-ray luminosity function and the
radial proﬁle of surface brightness of 47 Tuc ( Grindlay
et al. 2001; Gebhardt & Fischer 1995), expected number
of X-ray source of > 1035 erg cm−2 s−1 within the core
radius of a globular cluster is ∼ 0.14. Since the core ra-
dius of GRS 1747−312 is 3.′′3, a contaminant source that
cannot be resolved with Suzaku is not so unlikely.
The ﬂux of the contaminant source is mostly around
∼ 10−11 erg cm−2 s−1 (ﬁgure 18), which corresponds to
the luminosity of ∼ 2 × 1035 erg s−1 assuming the dis-
tance of 9.5 kpc. The ﬂux occasionally decreases to a
few hundredths of the usual value as suggested by the
XMM-Newton observation. If the type-I burst observed
with Suzaku (see ﬁgure 7; Iwai et al. 2014) came from the
contaminant source, the contaminant source should be a
neutron star X-ray binary. However, it is also possible
that we saw the superposition of the contaminant source
and the type-I burst occurred at GRS 1747−312.
If this contaminant scenario is correct, the position of
the X-ray source might change during the eclipses. We
made the projection proﬁles of the Chandra image along
the declination axis during and outside the eclipse sepa-
rately. The proﬁles were ﬁtted with a Gaussian function,
and we found no signiﬁcant changes in the peak position
and the width of the Gaussian function. We also examined
the Swift image during the eclipse, and the peak position
is also consistent with GRS 1747−312 though the statis-
tics are poor (see section 3.1.4). Thus we see no signiﬁcant

evidence for the contaminant source in our observational
data. Note, however, that the Chandra observation an-
alyzed in this paper was conducted with the CC mode
and a one-dimensional image was obtained. The other
Chandra HRC-I observation did not cover the predicted
eclipse (in’t Zand et al. 2003). A future Chandra obser-
vation covering the eclipse might be able to detect the
change of the source position.

The lapse of the eclipse during the Suzaku observation
might be explained if direct X-rays from a neutron star
and an accretion disk are perfectly blocked by thick ma-
terial between the companion star and the neutron star
(ﬁgure 20). In this condition, direct emission from near
the neutron star that can be screened by the compan-
ion star cannot be seen. Then we see no change of the
ﬂux and spectrum at the predicted time of the eclipse.
To block the direct X-rays, a column density larger than
NH ≥ 1024 cm−2 is required. However, we saw the X-ray
ﬂux of ∼ 10−11 erg cm−2 s−1 during the Suzaku observa-
tion. We think that the outer parts of the thick material
may have lower column density and the Compton scat-
tered X-rays by the hot corona can penetrate the material.
That is why the hard component of the Suzaku spectrum
suﬀers the heavy absorption of ∼ 1023 cm−2 (table 5). To
explain the soft component, we further assume that the
outer parts of the material is patchy. Then we tried to
ﬁt a partially covered model to the Suzaku spectra. The
CompTT model was assumed, and the “pcfabs” model in
XSPEC was used to represent the partial covering. The
model can be written as ”phabs1 × pcfabs × CompTT”.
The ”pcfabs” is given by

(pcfabs) = f (phabs2) + (1 − f ),

(1)

where f represents the covering fraction. The phabs1
was installed to represent the interstellar absorption and
was ﬁxed to be 1.2 × 1022 cm−2. The parameters of the
CompTT component were assumed to be the same for
both intervals A and B. Similar to the previous analyses,

best-ﬁt parameters are summarized in table 6. The ab-

from interval A to interval B, and this can explain the soft

The partial covering model cannot describe the XMM-

the thick material scenario cannot be adopted to the low-
luminosity state generally.

had a long duration with photospheric radius expan-
sion, which indicate that the peak luminosity reached the
Eddington luminosity (Iwai et al. 2014). Indeed, the bolo-
metric luminosity calculated from the data at the peak
was ∼ 3 × 1038 erg s−1 for 9.5 kpc, which is consistent
with the Eddington luminosity for a 1.4 M⊙ neutron star.

at this moment, deﬁnitely. The thick absorber may be
photo-ionized during the Type-I burst because of its high
luminosity. Then the absorption column density can be
less than that during the persistent state. However, we
found no evidences for such ionization.

As discussed in section 3.2.3,

it cannot be fully re-
jected that weak eclipsing events were observed during the
Suzaku observation. If there was an X-ray corona of which
scale height is larger than the companion star, the X-rays
are not completely blocked by the companion star even
during the interval of the eclipse. In this case, we could
see a part of the corona emission even in the eclipse, and
we would expect a weak eclipsing event. However, when
we assume such a highly extended corona, the steep drop
of the ﬂux during the Suzaku observation is hard to be
explained.

5. Summary

GRS 1747−312 was observed by Chandra in 2004,
XMM-Newton in 2004, Suzaku in 2009 and Swift in 2013.
The Chandra and Swift observations were done during the
outburst. These observations covered the predicted time
of the eclipse, except for the XMM-Newton. This is the
ﬁrst time to study the property of GRS 1747−312 outside
the outburst state.
During the Chandra and Swift observations, the eclipses
were observed at the predicted time. Remaining X-
rays were detected during the eclipses. An averaged 2–
10 keV ﬂux outside the eclipse observed with Chandra

and Swift was ∼ 5× 10−10 erg cm−2 s−1, but it decreased
to ∼ 10−11 erg cm−2 s−1 during the eclipse. This feature
was consistent with the previous research (in’t Zand et
al. 2000) and some other eclipsing LMXBs. During the
Suzaku observation, on the other hand, the eclipse was
not observed. An averaged 2–10 keV ﬂux observed with
Suzaku was ∼ 10−11 erg cm−2 s−1, which was comparable
to the ﬂux during the eclipse. The XMM-Newton ﬂux was
very low at 2.7 × 10−13 erg cm−2 s−1.
These results may suggest that another source is located
quite close to GRS 1747−312. When GRS 1747−312 is
not in the outburst state, the observed X-rays came from
the contaminant source rather than from GRS 1747−312.
However, we did not obtain clear evidence for the contam-
inant source in our data.

The results might be explained by thick material (N >
1024 cm−2) between the neutron star and the companion
star which completely blocked the direct X-rays from the
neutron star. Outer parts of the thick material is less thick
and patchy, and X-rays Compton scattered by hot corona
can penetrate those parts. In fact, the Suzaku spectrum
can be described by the partially covered CompTT model.
The origin of the thick material, however, is not clear.

Appendix. Suzaku HXD spectrum

The PIN count rate was 0.65 cts s−1 in the 15–70 keV
band after the subtraction of the Non X-ray Background.
The count rate of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB)
was negligible. On the other hand, the PIN count rate
estimated from the XIS count rate and spectrum of
GRS 1747−312 was ∼ 0.03 cts s−1. The observed PIN
count rate was thus ∼ 20 times larger. This suggests
contamination by other objects.
We searched other X-ray sources near GRS 1747−312
with the SIMBAD database6.
In the database, there
is an X-ray source, IGR J17511−3057 at (α, δ)J2000.0 =
(267.◦7861, −30.◦9614) (Nowak et al. 2009). The position
is 19.′4 north from the center of the ﬁeld of view of the
PIN. IGR J17511−3057 exhibited an outburst on 2009
September 11 (Baldovin et al. 2009; Markwardt et al.
2009), which was ﬁve days before the Suzaku observation.
The count rate on September 16 of IGR J17511−3057
observed with RXTE was ∼ 70 counts s−1 per a detec-
tor (Proportional Counter Unit; PCU) in the 2–25 keV
band (Riggio et al. 2011). Assuming a power-law spec-
trum with Γ = 2.0, the count rate corresponds to ∼

0.52 cts s−1 of PIN. We thus concluded that the PIN count
rate was dominated by IGR J17511−3057, and we decided
not to use the PIN data for our analysis.
