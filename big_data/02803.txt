A class of minimal submanifolds in spheres

M. Dajczer and Th. Vlachos

Abstract

We introduce a class of minimal submanifolds M n, n ≥ 3, in spheres Sn+2
that are ruled by totally geodesic spheres of dimension n − 2. If simply-connected,
such a submanifold admits a one-parameter associated family of equally ruled
minimal isometric deformations that are genuine. As for compact examples, there
are plenty of them but only for dimensions n = 3 and n = 4. In the ﬁrst case, we
have that M 3 must be a S1-bundle over a minimal torus T 2 in S5 and in the second
case M 4 has to be a S2-bundle over a minimal sphere S2 in S6. In addition, we
provide new examples in relation to the well-known Chern-do Carmo-Kobayashi
problem since taking the torus T 2 to be ﬂat yields a minimal submanifolds M 3 in
S5 with constant scalar curvature.

In several directions, this paper should be considered as a continuation of our work
in [8] where a new class of minimal ruled submanifolds M n of Euclidean space Rn+2,
n ≥ 3, were studied. These submanifolds lay in codimension two and may be metrically
complete regardless the dimension. The rulings are of codimension two in the manifold
whereas the rank, that is, the complement of the index of relative nullity, is ρ = 4
(unless n = 3 = ρ) along an open dense subset. If simply-connected, the submanifolds
admit a S1-parameter family of genuine isometric deformations. Hence, this class of
examples should be seen as a new addition to the possible, local or global, classiﬁcation of
Euclidean submanifolds in codimension two that admit genuine isometric deformations;
see [8] for a discussion of that open problem.

In this paper, we consider a similar construction but for the round sphere as ambient
space. We obtain minimal submanifolds M n in Sn+2, n ≥ 3, with similar properties as
the ones in the Euclidean space. Notice that being ruled now means that the submanifold
carries a foliation by (open subsets of) totally geodesic spheres in Sn+2 of dimension n−2.
If the manifold is simply-connected, by taking the cones in Rn+3 of the components in
the associated family in Sn+2 we obtain a new class of genuinely deformable Euclidean
submanifolds in codimension two but, of course, these are not complete.

New examples of minimal submanifolds in spheres are certainly welcome since the
explicitly known ones are usually quite elaborate and certainly less abundant than in
the Euclidean space. Frequently, they are spheres of constant sectional curvature or
products of them. On the other hand, the submanifolds here introduced can only be
complete, or even compact, for dimensions n = 3 or 4. If compact and according to the
dimension, the submanifold must be topologically either a S1-bundle over S1 × S1 in S5
or a S2-bundle over S2 in S6.

The compact examples in the case of the torus are of particular interest by two
quite diﬀerent reasons. First, if we replace the torus by its universal cover we obtain a
three-dimensional manifold that is not longer compact but has an S1-parameter family
of isometric minimal deformations. But the compact submanifold itself only admits, at
most, a ﬁnite set of isometric minimal deformations. The second reason, has to do with
the well-known Chern-do Carmo-Kobayashi problem [5] that concerns compact minimal
submanifolds of the sphere with constant scalar curvature. We show that if the torus
considered is ﬂat, and these were all parametrically described by Miyaoka [12], then M 3
has constant scalar curvature.

1 The results

This section is devoted to state the results of the paper while proofs are left for the
following one. Up to the last two results, the other theorems in this paper can be seen
as the “spherical version” of the results obtained in [8] for submanifolds in Euclidean
space

Let g : L2 → Sn+2 denote a substantial oriented minimal surface. As already recalled

in [8] the normal bundle NgL of g splits along an open dense subset of L2 as

NgL = N g

1 ⊕ N g

2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ N g

m, m = [(n + 1)/2],

where each subbundle N g
fundamental form αs+1
last one that has rank one if n is odd.

g

s , 1 ≤ s ≤ m, is spanned by the corresponding (s + 1)th-
: T L × · · · × T L → NgL and has rank two except possible the

If L2 is simply-connected, there exists a one-parameter associated family of minimal
isometric immersions. In fact, for each constant θ ∈ S1 = [0, π) consider the parallel
orthogonal tensor ﬁeld

Jθ = cos θI + sin θJ

where I is the identity map and J the complex structure determined by the metric and
orientation. Then, the symmetric section αg(Jθ·, ·) of the bundle Hom(T L × T L, NgL)
satisﬁes the Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci equations with respect to the same induced normal
connection; see [6] for details. Therefore, there exists an isometric minimal immersion

2

gθ : L2 → Sn+2 whose second fundamental form is

αgθ(X, Y ) = φθαg(JθX, Y )

where φθ : NgL → NgθL is the parallel vector bundle isometry that identiﬁes the normal
bundles as well as each normal subbundles N g

for any 1 ≤ s ≤ m.

s with N gθ
s

In the sequel, let g : L2 → Sn+2, n ≥ 2 be a substantial 1-isotropic surface. This
means that g is minimal and that the ellipse of curvature (of ﬁrst order) at any point is
a circle. Let L0 be the open subset of L2 where dim N g
1 (p) = 2. It was shown in [7] that
L2 r L0 consists of isolated points and that the vector bundle N g
1 |L0 smoothly extends
to a plane bundle over L2, that we still denote by N g
1 .

Let π : Λg → L2 denote the vector bundle of rank n−2 whose ﬁbers are the orthogonal
complement in the normal bundle NgL of g of its extended ﬁrst normal bundle N g
1 . Then
Fg : M n → Sn+2 is the submanifold of Sn+2 associated to g constructed by attaching at
each point of the surface g the totally geodesic sphere Sn−2 whose tangent space at that
point is the ﬁber of Λg, that is,

(p, v) ∈ Λg 7→ Fg(p, v) = expg(p) v,

(1)

while dropping the singular points whenever they exist, i.e., points where the induced
metric is singular. By deﬁnition Fg is an (n − 2)-ruled submanifold, that is, there is an
integrable tangent distribution of dimension n − 2 whose leaves are mapped diﬀeomor-
phically by Fg onto open subsets of totally geodesic (n − 2)-spheres of Sn+2.

For simplicity, it is very convenient to do computations in terms of the cone of M n
in Sn+2 ⊂ Rn+3, and then view M n as the intersection of that cone with Sn+2. More
precisely, we consider the map Gg : R × Λg → Rn+3 given by

Gg(s, p, v) = sg(p) + v

(2)

and set SG = {0} ×(cid:0)Λ∗

g(p) r {0}(cid:1) where

g(p) = {(p, v) ∈ Λg : v ⊥ N g
Λ∗

2 (p)}.

In next section, we show that the set of singular points of the metric induced by Gg
consists of the vertex V = (0, p, 0) and the set SG. Set

N n+1 = R × Λg r (V ∪ SG)

and denote G = Gg|N n+1. Thus, we have

M n = {(s, p, v) ∈ R × Λg r SG : s2 + kvk2 = 1}

and Fg = G|M n where M n is endowed with the induced metric. Observe that M n is
complete (respectively, compact) if and only if g is complete (respectively, compact) and
SG is empty. Notice also that SG can only be empty for n = 3, 4.

3

In the sequel, we denote by H the tangent distribution orthogonal to the rulings.
An embedded surface j : L2 → M n is called an integral surface of H if j∗TpL = H(j(p))
at every point p ∈ L2.

Theorem 1. Let g : L2 → Sn+2, n ≥ 3, be a 1-isotropic substantial surface. Then the
associated immersion Fg : M n → Sn+2 is an (n − 2)-ruled minimal submanifold with
rank ρ = 4 (unless n = 3 = ρ) on an open dense subset of M n. Moreover, the integral
surface L2 of H is totally geodesic and unique up to the one obtained by composing with
the antipodal map.

Conversely, let F : M n → Sn+2 be an (n − 2)-ruled minimal immersion with n ≥ 4
and ρ = 4 (unless n = 3 = ρ) on an open dense subset of M n. Assume that H admits a
totally geodesic integral surface j : L2 → M n which is a global cross section to the rulings.
Then the surface g = F ◦ j : L2 → Sn+2 is 1-isotropic and F can be parametrized as Fg.

The existence of genuine deformations is considered in the following result.

Theorem 2. Let g : L2 → Sn+2, n ≥ 3, be a simply-connected 1-isotropic substantial
surface. Then Fg allows a smooth one-parameter family of minimal genuine isometric
deformations Fθ : M n → Sn+2, θ ∈ S1, such that F0 = Fg and each Fθ carries the same
rulings and relative nullity leaves as Fg.

The relation between the second fundamental forms of members of the associated

family is given next, for simplicity, in terms of their cones.

Theorem 3. Let g : L2 → Sn+2, n ≥ 3, be a simply-connected 1-isotropic substantial
surface. Then G allows an associated smooth one-parameter family of minimal genuine
isometric immersions Gθ : N n+1 → Rn+3, θ ∈ S1, such that G0 = G and each Gθ carries
the same rulings and relative nullity leaves as G.

Moreover, there is a parallel vector bundle isometry Ψθ : NGN → NGθN such that

the relation between the second fundamental forms is given by

αGθ (X, Y ) = Ψθ(cid:0)R−θαG(X, Y ) + 2κ sin(θ/2)β(J−θ/2X, Y )(cid:1)

(3)

where Rθ is the rotation of angle θ on NGN that preserves orientation, κ is the radius
of the ellipse of curvature of g and β is the traceless bilinear form deﬁned by (17).

A substantial surface in even codimension g : L2 → Sn+2 is called pseudoholomorphic
when the ellipses of curvature of any order are circles at any point. In odd codimension,
the surface is called isotropic when the ellipses of curvature of any order but for the last
one-dimensional normal subbundle are circles at any point.

If g : L2 → Sn+2 is pseudoholomorphic, then taking a rotation of angle θ ∈ S1 that
preserves orientation in each N g
s , s ≥ 2, induces an intrinsic isometry Sθ on M n. The
next result says that Fg is equivariant with respect to the one-parameter family of
intrinsic isometries Sθ.

4

Theorem 4. If g : L2 → Sn+2 is pseudoholomorphic, then Fg ◦ S−θ is congruent to Fθ
for any θ ∈ S1.

We have that Fg : M 3 → S5 or Fg : M 4 → S6 is compact if and only if L2 is compact
and g is regular. The latter condition means that L0 is empty and that N g
2 has constant
dimension. According to a result of Asperti [1] any compact regular substantial minimal
surface in S5 is a topological torus and in S6 is a topological sphere. For both cases,
In fact, the tori in S5 include the ﬂat ones
there are plenty of 1-isotropic examples.
described parametrically by Miyaoka [12] and those that are holomorphic with respect
to the nearly Kaehler structure of S6 considered in [3], [10] and [11]. Other examples of
1-isotropic surfaces in S5 are the Legendrian surfaces given in [13].

Minimal 2-spheres in spheres have been investigated by Calabi, Barbosa and Chern
among others. From their work, we know that these surfaces must be substantial in
even codimension and pseudoholomorphic. It was then shown by Calabi [4] that any
such surface in S6 is regular if its area is 24π. Then Barbosa [2] proved that the space of
these surfaces is diﬀeomorphic to SO(7, C)/SO(7, R), where SO(7, C) denotes the set
of 7 × 7 complex matrices that satisfy AAt = I and det A = 1.

Concerning the set of genuine minimal isometric deformations of compact submani-

folds constructed from tori we have the following result.

Theorem 5. Let g : L2 → S5 be a regular substantial isotropic surface. Then, the set of
all equally ruled minimal isometric immersions of M 3 into S5 as Fg : M 3 → S5 is ﬁnite
or parametrized by a circle S1. If L2 is compact then the set is necessarily ﬁnite.

As discussed in the introduction the last result is of independent interest.

Theorem 6. Let g be a ﬂat 1-isotropic torus in S5. Then Fg : M 3 → S5 is a compact
minimal submanifold with constant normalized scalar curvature s = −1/3.

2 The proofs

In this section, we provide several proofs for n ≥ 4 but similar arguments take care of
the case n = 3.

First we discussed the set of singular points of Fg.

Proposition 7. Let g : L2 → Sn+2, n ≥ 4, be a substantial oriented minimal surface.
Then, the set of singular points of the map G : R × Λg → Rn+3 given by (2) consists of
V = (0, p, 0) and SG.

Proof: Fix (s0, p0, v0) ∈ R×Λgr{V }. Choose a smooth orthonormal frame {e5, . . . , en+2}
of Λg on a neighborhood U of p0 and set

v0 = Xi≥1

aiei+4(p0).

Consider the projection Π : R×Λg → L2 and parametrize Π−1(U) via the diﬀeomorphism
h : U × Rn−1 → Π−1(U) given by

h(p, s, t1, . . . , tn−2) = (cid:0)s, p,Xi≥1

tiei+4(cid:1).

That (s0, p0, v0) ∈ SG means that there exists a non-zero vector

Z = X + λ0∂/∂s +Xi≥1

λi∂/∂ti ∈ ker(G ◦ h)∗(p0, s0, a1, . . . , an−2)

where X ∈ Tp0L. Thus,

λ0g(p0) + s0g∗(p0)X +Xi≥1

ai∇⊥

X ei+4(p0) +Xi≥1

λiei+4(p0) = 0.

Since Z 6= 0, we obtain that λ0 = 0, s0 = 0, X 6= 0 and

Xi≥1

ai∇⊥

X ei+4(p0) +Xi≥1

λiei+4(p0) = 0.

It follows that

hv0, ∇⊥

Xξi(p0) = 0

for any ξ ∈ N g

1 . We easily conclude that v0 ⊥ N g

2 (p0). The converse is immediate.
In the sequel, we argue for an open set of L2 where all the normal subspaces N g

s ’s of
the substantial oriented minimal surface g : L2 → Sn+2 have constant dimension. Choose
local positively oriented orthonormal frames {e1, e2} in T L and {e3, e4} of N g
1 such that

αg(e1, e1) = κe3 and αg(e1, e2) = µe4

where κ, µ are the semi-axes of the ellipse of curvature. Take a local orthonormal normal
frame {e5, . . . , en+2} such that {e2r+1, e2r+2} is positively oriented spanning N g
r for every
even r. When n = 2m + 1 is odd, then e2m+1 spans the last normal bundle. We refer to
{e1, . . . , en+2} as an adapted frame of g and consider the one-forms

ωij = h ˜∇ei, eji for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n + 2,

6

where ˜∇ denotes the Riemannian connection in the ambient space. Using that

α3
g(e1, e1, e1) + α3

g(e1, e2, e2) = 0

we easily obtain

V = a1e1 + a2e2, W = b1e1 + b2e2, Y = c1e1 + c2e2 and Z = d1e1 + d2e2

the dual vector ﬁelds of ω35, ω36, ω45 and ω46, respectively. Then (4) is equivalent to

and hence

Clearly, we have that G : N n+1 → Rn+3 is an immersion and

T(s,p,v)N = R ⊕ T(p,v)Λg = R ⊕ HG(p, v) ⊕ V(p, v)

where R = span{∂/∂s} and HG is the orthogonal complement of V in T Λg. Moreover,
V denotes the vertical bundle of π : Λg → L2 given by V = ker π∗.

Fixed (p, v) ∈ Λg, let δv be the normal vector ﬁeld deﬁned in a neighborhood of p by

δv(q) = Xj≥5

hv, ej(p)iej(q).

Let βi, 1 ≤ i ≤ 2, be the curves in Λg satisfying βi(0) = (p, v) given by

βi(t) = (ci(t), δv(ci(t)))

where ci(t) is a smooth curve in a neighborhood of p satisfying c′

i(0) = ei(p). Set

Yi = β′

i(0) ∈ T(p,v)Λg, 1 ≤ i ≤ 2.

Let Gi, Hi ∈ C ∞(Λg), 1 ≤ i ≤ 2, be the functions

It is clear that G∗(s, p, v)V = (N g

1 (p))⊥ ⊂ NgL(p) holds up to parallel identiﬁcation
in Rn+3. The vector bundle V can be orthogonally decomposed as V = V 1 ⊕ V 0 where
V 1 denotes the plane bundle determined by

G∗(s, p, v)V 1 = N g

2 (p).

Let {E3, E4} and {E5, . . . , En} be local orthonormal frames of V 1 and V 0, respectively,
such that

Proof: We compute at (s, p, v) ∈ N n+1. Let γ(t) = (s, p, v(t)) be a curve in N n+1 such
that v(0) = v, and thus γ′(0) ∈ V(p, v). We have that

ξ∗γ′(0) = hDv/dt(0), e5(p)ig∗V (p) + hDv/dt(0), e6(p)ig∗W (p),

or equivalently, that

ξ∗γ′(0) = hG∗γ′(0), e5(p)ig∗V (p) + hG∗γ′(0), e6(p)ig∗W (p).

From this we obtain (10). Similarly, we have (11).

To obtain (12) to (15) one has to use Lemma 8 and the Gauss and Weingarten
formulas for g. We only argue for (12) since the proof of the other equations is similar.
We have from (8) and (10) that

ξ∗Xi = ξ∗Yi + Gig∗V + Hig∗W, 1 ≤ i ≤ 2.

In view of (7) and since

ξ ◦ βi(t) = t0

1g∗V (ci(t)) + t0

2g∗W (ci(t)) + se3(ci(t)),

we obtain in terms of the connection in L2 that

We thus have that

(n − 2)-ruled minimal immersion with rank ρ = 4 everywhere, then the tangent bundle
splits as T M = H ⊕ V, where H is orthogonal to the rulings. Moreover, we have that V
splits as V = V 1 ⊕ V 0 with the ﬁbers of V 0 being the relative nullity leaves.

The normal space of the surface g = F ◦ j at x ∈ L2 is given by

NgL(x) = F∗(j(x))V ⊕ NF M(j(x)).

Being j is totally geodesic, we have

αg(X, Y ) = αF (j∗X, j∗Y )

(16)

for all X, Y ∈ T L. This and our assumptions imply that g is minimal.

Let π : Λg → L2 denote the subbundle of the normal bundle of g whose ﬁber at

x ∈ L2 is F∗(j(x))V. We consider the cone CF : R × M n → Rn+3 given by

Observe that

CF (t, p) = tF (p).

CF (t, p) − CF (u(t, p), j(x)) = CF (t, p) − u(t, p)g ◦ π(p) ∈ F∗(j(x))V

for any p ∈ M n, where x = π(p), since p and j(x) belong to the same leaf of V and

u(t, p) = t/hF (p), g ◦ π(p)i.

Since CF maps locally diﬀeomorphically the leaves of V onto aﬃne subspaces, it follows
that the map T : R × M n → R × Λg given by

T (t, p) = (u(t, p), π(p), CF (t, p) − u(t, p)g ◦ π(p))

is a local diﬀeomorphism. Clearly the immersion ˜G = CF ◦ T −1 satisﬁes

˜G(s, x, v) = sg(x) + v,

i.e., ˜G = Gg is of the form (2). Identifying locally R × M n with R × Λg via T , we have
that CF = Gg = G and j is the zero section of Λg, i.e., we have the parametrization
given by (2). The horizontal and the vertical bundles satisfy

G∗(s, p, v)V = (N g

1 (p))⊥ ⊂ NgL(p), G∗(s, p, v)HG ⊂ g∗TpL ⊕ (Λg(p))⊥,

and now (16) yields N g

NGN(s, p, v) ⊂ g∗TpL ⊕ (Λg(p))⊥

Hence λ = 1 since, otherwise, we would have that ω35 = ω36 = ω45 = ω46 = 0, and that
is a contradiction.

We now prove the direct statement. Since Fg = G|M , we obtain that g = Fg ◦ j
where j : L2 → M n is given by j(x) = (±1, x, 0). Clearly, we have that j is an integral
surface of the distribution orthogonal to the rulings that is totally geodesic and a global
cross section to the rulings. Up to uniqueness of the integral surface the proof follows
from Lemma 10.

12

Assume that there exists a second integral surface ˜j : L2 → M n. Set ˜g = Fg ◦ ˜j and

let ˜T : R × M n → R × Λ˜g be the local diﬀeomorphism given by

˜T (t, p) = (˜u(t, p), π(p), CF (p) − ˜u(t, p)˜g ◦ π(p))

where

Then ˜T ◦ T −1 : R × Λg → R × Λ˜g is given by

˜u(t, p) = t/hF (p), ˜g ◦ π(p)i.

˜T ◦ T −1(s, x, v) = (˜s, x, v + sg(x) − ˜s˜g(x)),

where T −1(s, x, v) = (t, p) and ˜s = ˜u(t, p). Hence Λg and Λ˜g can be identiﬁed by parallel
translation. Using that sg(x) − ˜s˜g(x) ∈ Λg(x), we obtain that ˜g = ±g.

The vertical bundle V of the submersion π given by V = ker π∗ can be orthogonally
decomposed as V = V 1 ⊕ V 0 on an open dense subset of L2, where V 1 denotes the
plane bundle determined by N g
2 are subbundles, which
we can assume without loss of generality.
In the sequel, we consider the orthogonal
decomposition of the tangent bundle of N n+1 given by

2 . In fact, this holds if N g

1 and N g

T N = span{∂/∂s} ⊕ HG ⊕ V

where we identify isometrically (and use the same notation) the subbundle V tangent
to the rulings with the corresponding normal subbundle to g. Then, it follows from the
proof that the relative nullity leaves of G are identiﬁed with the ﬁbers of span{∂/∂s}⊕V 0.

Let J denote the endomorphism such that J |HG : HG → HG is the almost complex
structure in HG determined by the orientation and restricted to span{∂/∂s} ⊕ V is the
identity and set

Jθ = cos θI + sin θJ .

Proof of Theorem 3: For each θ ∈ S1 consider the submanifold Gθ : N n+1 → Rn+3
deﬁned by

Gθ(s, p, v) = sgθ(p) + φθv

where φθ : NgL → NgθL is the parallel vector bundle isometry that identiﬁes the normal
subbundles of g and of gθ.

In the sequel, corresponding quantities of Gθ are denoted by the same symbol used
for G marked with θ. That Gθ is isometric to G is immediate. Since the tangent frame
{e1, e2} has been ﬁxed, we have for the adapted frames of gθ that

eθ
3 = φθ ◦ R1

θe3 and eθ

4 = φθ ◦ R1

θe4

where R1

θ is the rotation of angle θ on N g

1 . We complete the adapted frame choosing

eθ
j = φθej,

5 ≤ j ≤ n + 2.

13

Clearly, it holds that ωθ

34 = ω34 and ωθ

ij = ωij for i, j ≥ 5. Moreover,

ωθ
35 = cos θω35 − sin θ ∗ ω35 and ωθ

36 = cos θω36 − sin θ ∗ ω36.

Hence, the dual vector ﬁelds of ωθ

36 and ωθ

36 are given, respectively, by

Thus,

Vθ = J−θV and Wθ = J−θW.

1 = a1 cos θ + a2 sin θ, aθ
aθ
bθ
1 = b1 cos θ + b2 sin θ, bθ

2 = a2 cos θ − a1 sin θ,
2 = b2 cos θ − b1 sin θ.

It follows from (6), (7) and (8) that

By Lemma 8, the normal bundle of Gθ is spanned by

X θ

i = Xi,

i = 1, 2.

ξθ = gθ∗J−θ(t1V + t2W ) + sφθ ◦ R1

θe3,

ηθ = −gθ∗Jπ/2−θ(t1V + t2W ) + sφθ ◦ R1

θe4.

A straightforward computation yields that the map Ψθ : NGN → NGθN given by

Ψθξ = ξθ and Ψθη = ηθ

is a parallel vector bundle isometry. The shape operators of Gθ vanish on V 0 and
restricted to span{∂/∂s} ⊕ HG ⊕ V 1 and with respect to {E1, . . . , En} they are given by

Let Lθ : T N → T N be such that Lθ|span{∂/∂s}⊕V = 0 and Lθ|HG : HG → HG is the

reﬂection given by

Lθ|HG = (cid:20)− sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)
sin(θ/2)(cid:21)

cos(θ/2)

with respect to the tangent frame {E1, E2}. It follows easily that

Ψθξ = ARθξ − 2κ sin(θ/2)Lθ and Aθ

Ψθη = ARθη − 2κ sin(θ/2)J ◦ Lθ.

(17)

and the proof of (3) follows easily.

Finally, that the isometric deformations Gθ of G are genuine is immediate from
Lemma 10 since the shape operators of G have rank four for any normal direction along
an open dense subset of N n+1.

Proof of Theorem 2: Given θ ∈ S1, denote Fθ = Gθ|M where

Gθ(s, p, v) = sgθ(p) + φθv.

That Fg allows a one-parameter family of minimal isometric immersions Fθ : M n → Sn+2,
θ ∈ S1, such that F0 = Fg and each Fθ carries the same ruling and relative nullity leaves
as Fg is a consequence of Proposition 3.

Proof of Theorem 4: It is completely analogous to the proof of Theorem 6 in [8].
Proof of Theorem 5: Let ¯F : M 3 → S5 be a ruled isometric minimal immersion with
the same rulings as Fg and set ¯g = ¯F ◦ j. From the proof of Theorem 1, we have that
the surface ¯g is isometric to g and isotropic. Hence, the set of all minimal isometric
immersions of M 3 into S5 with the same rulings as Fg can be identiﬁed with the set of
all isotropic immersions of L2 into S5. The proof now follows from the results in [9].

Proof of Theorem 6: Using Lemma 8 and Lemma 10, we have that the squared length
of the second fundamental form of G is given by

kαGk2 =

4

Ω4(cid:16)(1 − K)Ω2 + ϕ2

1 + ϕ2

2 + Ω2 Xi=1,2

(h2

i + r2

i + s2

i )(cid:17).

It follows that

kαGk2(s, p, v) =

4

Ω2(cid:16)2 − K + h2

1 + h2

2 +

s2

Ω2 (kV k2 + kW k2 − 1)(cid:17).

(18)

By Corollary 4 in [15] any 1-isotropic torus in S5 is regular, hence M 3 is compact. On
the other hand, we have that g is O(6)-congruent to a holomorphic curve in the nearly
Kaehler sphere S6; see [10] or [15]. Choose local orthonormal frame {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5}
such that

αg(e1, e1) = p1/2e3, αg(e1, e2) = p1/2e4,

15

g(e1, e1, e1) = κ1e5, α3
α3

g(e1, e1, e2) = 0,

where κ1 = p1/2 by Theorem 5 in [15]. Hence, we have that V = e1. From Lemma 6

in [14] we obtain h1 = h2 = 0. Now (18) gives

kαGk2(s, p, v) =

8
Ω2 =

and hence kαF k2 = 8.
