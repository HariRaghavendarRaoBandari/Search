ABSTRACT

Context. The history of the mass assembly of brightest cluster galaxies may be studied by the mapping the stellar populations at
large radial distances from the galaxy centre, where the dynamical times are long and preserve the chemodynamical signatures of the
accretion events.
Aims. To provide extended and robust measurements of the stellar population parameters in NGC 3311, the cD galaxy at the centre of
the Hydra I cluster and out to three eﬀective radius. We wish to characterize the processes that drove the build up of the stellar light
at all these radii.
Methods. We obtained the spectra from several regions in NGC 3311 covering an area of ∼ 3 arcmin2 in the wavelength range
4800 (cid:46) λ(Å) (cid:46) 5800, using the FORS2 spectrograph at the VLT in the MXU masking mode. We measured the equivalent width
of seven absorption-features deﬁned in the Lick/IDS system, that were modelled by single stellar populations to provide luminosity-
weighted ages, metallicities and alpha element abundances.
Results. The trends in the Lick indices and the distribution of the stellar population parameters indicate that the stars of NGC 3311
may be divided in two radial regimes, one within and the another beyond one eﬀective radius, Re = 8.4 kpc, similar to the distinction
between inner galaxy and external halo derived from the NGC 3311 velocity dispersion proﬁle. The inner galaxy (R ≤ Re) is old (age
∼ 14 Gyr), have negative metallicity gradients and positive alpha element gradients. The external halo is also very old, but have a
negative age gradient. The metal and element abundances of the external halo have both a large scatter, indicating that stars from a
variety of satellites with diﬀerent masses have been accreted. The region in the extended halo associated with the oﬀ-centred envelope
at 0◦ < P.A. < 90◦ (Arnaboldi et al. 2012) has higher metallicity with respect to the symmetric external halo.
Conclusions. The diﬀerent stellar populations in the inner galaxy and extended halo reﬂect the dominance of in situ stars in the
former and the accreted origin for the large majority of the stars in the latter. The low value of the velocity dispersion in the inner
galaxy indicates that its stars are bound to the galaxy’s gravitational potential, and the abundances and gradients suggest that the
inner galaxy is formed in an outside-in scenario of merging gas-rich lumps, reminiscent of the ﬁrst phase of galaxy formation. The
external halo has a higher velocity dispersion, it is dynamically hotter than the galaxy and its stars are gravitationally driven by the
cluster’s gravitational potential. The stars in the external halo were removed from their parent galaxies, either disks with truncated
star formation or the outer regions of early-type galaxies. Late mass accretion at large radii is now coming from tidal stripping of
stars from dwarfs and S0 galaxies. These results provide supporting evidence to the recent theoretical models of formation of massive
ellipticals as a two-phase process.

1. Introduction

Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) are the giant early-type
galaxies found at the core of galaxy clusters. BCGs often display
extended, diﬀuse stellar halos, known as cD envelopes, which
are believed to be composed of stars stripped from satellite
galaxies interacting with the cluster’s halo by tidal interactions
and dynamical friction (Gallagher & Ostriker 1972; Dressler
1979). Due to the long relaxation times at large radii, stellar ha-
los are not well-mixed and, therefore, preserve chemodynamical
signatures of the past accretion events which have survived to

present day and can be used to access the history of the galaxy
mass assembly.

The initial processes of galaxy formation through monolithic
collapse do set abundance gradients, which are modiﬁed by the
subsequent history of accretion over time. Initial strong metal-
licity gradients arise naturally in galaxies formed by the collapse
of gas clouds in the monolithic scenario (Larson 1974) or by the
merging of numerous gas rich sub-galaxies (Kobayashi 2004).
The subsequent evolution via major mergers is able to dilute
metallicity gradients by the mixing of stars in the central re-
gions of galaxies (White 1980; Kobayashi 2004), while minor
mergers may form gradients at larger radii by the deposit of stars
with diﬀerent abundances (Villumsen 1983; Hirschmann et al.
2015). Observations in the last decade, such as the population
of compact massive objects at high redshift (van Dokkum et al.

2008; van der Wel et al. 2014) and the evolution of sizes and
concentrations with redshift (Naab et al. 2009), suggest that mas-
sive ellipticals are formed by diﬀerent processes over time in the
two-phase scenario (De Lucia & Blaizot 2007; Oser et al. 2010).
Galaxies are formed at high redshift (z (cid:38) 3) during star for-
mation events triggered by rapid dissipative processes, such as
cold accretion of gas through ﬁlaments (Kereš et al. 2005; Dekel
et al. 2009) or gas-rich major mergers (Robertson et al. 2006),
followed by an extended accretion of stars of smaller galaxies,
usually at large galactic radii.

In the two-phase scenario, stars inhabiting a halo can be di-
vided into two categories according to the sub-halo in which they
have been formed: in situ and accreted. The in situ stars were
formed in the most massive sub-halo of a galaxy during the ﬁrst
phase of galaxy formation, which resulted in stars with relatively
high metallicity, due to their deep gravitational potential that can
retain the metals ejected by supernovae (Tremonti et al. 2004),
and high alpha element abundance due to the rapid time-scales
of star formation (see, e.g., Thomas et al. 2005). The accreted
stars were formed in galaxies with a variety of masses and, con-
sequently, have diﬀerent abundances and ages. Spatially, in situ
stars are centrally concentrated and usually dominate the light in
the central ∼ 5 − 10 kpc of elliptical galaxies, contributing sig-
niﬁcantly to the stellar halo out to ∼ 30 kpc, while the accreted
stars are less centrally concentrated and dominate the light in
the outer regions (Oser et al. 2010; Cooper et al. 2013). From a
dynamical point of view, in situ stars have suﬀered violent re-
laxation processes in the early phases of the galaxy formation,
while the accreted stars may be still unrelaxed, especially at the
largest radii, and thus may exhibit an inhomogeneous spatial dis-
tribution which survived to the present day (Cooper et al. 2015).
The observational test for this model of galaxy formation
relies on the measurement of stellar population parameters in
early-type galaxies out to large radii, but the low surface bright-
ness in these regions makes spectroscopic measurements diﬃ-
cult. Nevertheless, current state-of-the art investigations seem in
agreement with the predictions from the two-phase scenario. In
the case of NGC 4889 in the Coma cluster, Coccato et al. (2010b)
showed that there are diﬀerent populations in the core and halo
consistent with the idea of accreted stars dominating the light at
radii R > 18 kpc. Similarly, diﬀerences between the inner and
outer stellar populations have been found for other cD galax-
ies such as NGC 3311 (Coccato et al. 2011), M49 (Mihos et al.
2013), M87 (Virgo cluster, Montes et al. 2014) and NGC 6166
(Abell 2199, Bender et al. 2015), and even in several non BCGs
(Pastorello et al. 2014). However, these studies provide limited
information about the distribution of the metal abundances and
ages, because they were performed either by photometry, which
has good spatial information but does not provide detailed abun-
dances and ages, or by long-slit spectroscopy, which is limited to
the slit position, but provides abundance and age information in
detail. Ideally we would like to be able to collect the metal abun-
dance and age information over the entire spatial extension of the
galaxy light, for an extensive mapping of its physical properties.
In this work we study the galaxy NGC 3311, the cD of the
Hydra I cluster, in order to provide the ﬁrst bi-dimensional and
large scale view of the stellar population of this system, which
together with the detailed kinematic study (paper II) can shed
further insights in a number of speciﬁc formation scenarios that
have been recently proposed for this system. NGC 3311 has a
radial velocity of ∼3800 km s−1 and a positive velocity disper-
sion proﬁle (Ventimiglia et al. 2010), indicating that its extended
halo is driven by the cluster potential at R > 8 kpc and may be
composed of the debris shredded from satellite galaxies falling

into the cluster’s centre (Coccato et al. 2011). Furthermore, such
rising velocity dispersion proﬁle seems to be asymmetric at large
radii, as observed at diﬀerent position angles (Ventimiglia et al.
2010; Richtler et al. 2011). A scenario of on-going interactions
and extended built-up of the stellar mass is also supported by
the presence of multiple components in the line-of-sight velocity
distribution of the planetary nebulae in NGC 3311 (Ventimiglia
et al. 2011), of substructures and tails in the halo light distri-
bution (Arnaboldi et al. 2012) and by the distribution of dwarf
galaxies around NGC 3311 (Misgeld et al. 2008).

In the accompanying paper on the kinematics of NGC 3311
(Paper II, Hilker et al. in prep.), we focus on the kinematic prop-
erties, discuss the implications for the mass proﬁle of NGC 3311
and explore possible formation histories of the massive star clus-
ters observed by Misgeld et al. (2011). In the current paper, we
present the spatial map of the stellar population parameters, ages
and abundances, out to large radii. The article is organized as
follow. In Section 2 we describe our data set and the methods
of data reduction. In Section 3 we describe the measurements
for the absorption features using Lick indices, and in Section 4
we convert this information into physical parameters of the stel-
lar populations. In Section 5, we discuss the correspondence of
the stellar populations with kinematic and morphological struc-
tures, which are discussed in detail in Section 6. In Section 7 we
discuss our main ﬁndings in line with recent observational and
theoretical works and provide an updated view of the NGC 3311
halo formation based on recent works. Finally, we proceed to an
overview and conclusion of this work in Section 8. We assume a
distance to the core of the Hydra cluster of 50.7 Mpc, calculated
by the Hubble ﬂow considering a radial velocity of 3777 km
s−1 (Struble & Rood 1999) and H0 = 70.5 km s−1 Mpc−1 (Ko-
matsu et al. 2009). The adopted eﬀective radius for NGC 3311 is
Re = 8.4 kpc, which is the mean value of the isophotal analysis
in the V-band from Arnaboldi et al. (2012).

2. Observations and Data Reduction
In this study we explore a new spectroscopic data set for the
Hydra I cluster. The data was observed at the Very Large Tele-
scope (VLT) at Paranal, Chile, using the UT1 8.2m telescope
with the FOcal Reducer/low dispersion Spectrograph 2 (FORS2,
Appenzeller et al. 1998) in the multi-object spectroscopic mode
with the Mask Exchange Unit (MXU), obtained under ESO pro-
gramme ID 088.B-0448B (PI: Richtler).

NGC 3311 spans a large area of the sky, and thus its observa-
tion out to large galactocentric distances requires a ﬁeld-of-view
beyond the area of most integral ﬁeld units available to date. In
order to survey an area of 3×3 arcmin2 around NGC 3311, which
translates into projected distances of ∼ 30 kpc, we sampled re-
gions of the stellar halo devoid of contamination of point sources
with small slits, with typical size of 1"×5", using 6 masks which
sample the stellar halo in shells: cen1, cen2, inn1 inn2, out1 and
out2. We used the grism 1400V with the standard collimator to
obtain a dispersion of 0.25Å pixel−1, which gives a spectral res-
olution of R = 2100 at 5200Å. The exposure times for the ceni
and inni masks covering the central region are 2×1400s, while it
is 6 × 1400s for the outi masks. This observing strategy resulted
in 135 slitlets dedicated to the observation of NGC 3311 and
NGC 3309. The numbers of extracted spectra is smaller though,
because we set a minimum signal-to-noise (S/N) of 10 in our
observations, in order to constrain the stellar population param-
eters. A total of 117 spectra are used in our analysis. They are
indicated by the red slits in Fig. 1.

tures in a given central band amidst two pseudo-continuum side-
bands. This process was carried out as follows.

We obtained the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD)
for each spectrum using the pPXF code (Cappellari & Emsellem
2004) considering four Gauss-Hermite LOSVD moments and
additive polynomials of order 12 in order to compensate for the
variations in the continuum. The adopted stellar templates come
from the Single Stellar Population (SSP) models of the MILES
library (Sánchez-Blázquez et al. 2006), with ages from 1 to 15
Gyr, and metallicities in the range −0.7 ≤[Z/H]≤ 0.2. They are
computed for a Salpeter Initial Mass Function with slope of 1.3.
The template spectra from the MILES library have a resolution
of FWHM=2.5Å, which is slightly larger than that our obser-
vations, FWHM=2.1Å. We then convolved our spectra with a
Gaussian ﬁlter to match the resolution of the MILES stellar li-
brary. In most cases, the best ﬁt was obtained by a linear combi-
nation of a small number of SSPs, but in a few cases a secondary
nebular component was accounted for in the templates, which
included emission lines for Hβ (4861Å), NI (5200Å) and OIII
(4957Å and 5007Å at ﬁxed ratio of 1:3), that is subtracted oﬀ
the observed spectrum, if present. For the measurement of the
Lick indices, we convolve our spectra to match the resolution of
the Lick/IDS system, using Gaussian ﬁlters of varied resolution
according to Worthey & Ottaviani (1997), before measuring the
EWs using a custom Python code.

To correct for the intrinsic broadening of the absorption fea-
tures, we used the ratio of the equivalent widths in the best ﬁt
from pPXF before and after the LOSVD convolution as in Coc-
cato et al. (2010a), using the relation

I(cid:48)

I =

I(cid:48)

where I(cid:48)
0 are the indices measured in the best ﬁt spec-
tra from pPXF with and without the LOSVD convolution, and
Imeas and I are the measured and the corrected indices for the
extracted spectra.

Finally, we also corrected the indices for the instrumental
oﬀsets by the observation of the standard star HD 102070, for
which Lick indices were determined by Schiavon (2007). Al-
though not all indices are determined for HD 102070 in the spec-
tral region of our data set, the relative small value of the correc-
tion in most cases and the good agreement with previous mea-
surements for NGC 3311 from Loubser & Sánchez-Blázquez
(2012) assure us that any systematics are relatively small. Un-
certainties for the Lick indices were estimated by Monte Carlo
simulations with perturbations in the velocity dispersion and the
addition of a bootstrapped noise, based on the residuals of the
pPXF models. In Fig. 2, we show typical examples of the ex-
tracted spectrum in our data set, including the best ﬁt and resid-
uals calculated with pPXF and the position of the Lick indices
bands. In columns 5 to 11 of Table 1 we show the values for the
corrected Lick indices of our extracted spectra.

3.2. Effect of systematic errors due to sky subtraction
Elliptical galaxies usually present large variances in their stel-
lar population properties at large radii, such as observed in
high S/N integral ﬁeld observations from the SAURON survey
(Kuntschner et al. 2006, 2010), and our results show similar
trends. One question is whether varying S/N from the inner re-
gions to large radii may be the primary source of scatter in the
derived stellar population parameters, as function of radius. In

in our sample. The position of the slits is shown as red bars, and the
colours of the polygon, calculated by Voronoi Tessellation, indicate the
S/N ratio according to the scale in the colour bar in the bottom left cor-
ner. Slits with white background were excluded from the analysis due
to their low quality (S/N< 10). Black lines show the V-band contours in
the range from 20 to 23.5 mag arcsec−2 in intervals of 0.5 mag arcsec−2,
from Arnaboldi et al. (2012). The geometry of the polygons is shown
herefater in all the other maps in this study.

The reduction processes for extracting the scientiﬁc spectra,
including bias subtraction, ﬂat ﬁelding correction, and wave-
length calibration, were performed using custom IRAF scripts.
We have used the long-slit spectrum of a spectrophotometric
standard star, HD 102070, to test the eﬀect of the ﬂux calibra-
tion on the Lick indices, which are used for the analysis of the
stellar populations. This test has shown that the median change
in the equivalent width of the indices is of 0.5% and, therefore,
there is no need of ﬂux calibrate our spectra. The spectrum for
sky subtraction of each slit was obtained simultaneously to the
observations at slits in the periphery of the CCD, using the same
x-axis position of the data, which ensured that science and sky
spectra share the same wavelength range and exposure time for
the subtraction. The wavelength range for spectra varies slightly
as a function of the x-axis in the CCD, but in most cases the
interval 4800 (cid:46) λ (Å)(cid:46) 5800 is available. For consistency, we
calculated the signal-to-noise ratio per angstrom (S/N) of each
spectrum in the range 5200 ≤ λ (Å) ≤ 5500, and the distribu-
tion of the S/N is presented by the polygons in Fig. 1. In this
case, and in all the maps shown in this work, we present the
distribution of parameters using these polygons calculated using
Voronoi tessellation and the V-band contours from observations
in Arnaboldi et al. (2012) in order to improve the visualization.

3. Line strength indices
3.1. Equivalent widths of Lick indices
The stellar population properties are studied by the analysis of
spectral absorption features using line-strength indices in the
Lick/IDS system (Worthey 1994; Trager et al. 1998), which con-
sists in calculating the equivalent widths (EW) of absorption fea-

Fig. 2. Examples of the LOSVD ﬁtting process with pPXF in our dataset. The sky subtracted spectra (black) are superposed by the best ﬁt templates
(red) obtained by a combination of SSP spectra from the MILES library (Sánchez-Blázquez et al. 2006), emission lines and an additive polynomial
of order 12, convolved with the line-of-sight velocity distribution with four moments. The best ﬁt emission lines (blue) are subtracted from the
spectra to avoid contamination on top of the absorption features. Residuals from the ﬁts are shown in the bottom (green dots). The Lick indices
are measured at the location of the vertical shades by the measurement of the equivalent width in central bands (dark grey) compared to the level
of the two pseudo continuum side bands (light gray).

order to verify whether this result is related to diﬀerent S/N, we
performed the following test. Since the main source of uncer-
tainty is the sky subtraction, we performed several measurements
of the Lick indices with diﬀerent values of under/over sky sub-
traction at the level of ±1% of the total sky in each spectrum.
This percentage was obtained by a visual inspection of our spec-
tra after the inclusion of this systematic error, which showed that
errors of this magnitude would leave easily recognizable features
resembling the sky spectra in the 2D spectra of low signal-to-
noise spectra (S/N∼ 15).

The result of this test is presented in Fig. A.1, where the dif-
ference of the EW of the indices, δILick, is plotted as a function
of radius. The deviations are calculated using a running standard
deviation, indicated by the grey shaded area. For a typical spec-
trum with S/N∼ 20, the variations of the measured EWs for the
Lick indices are δHβ =0.21 Å(12%), δFe5015 =0.43 Å(25%),
δMg b =0.35 Å(11%), δFe5270 =0.22 Å(18%), δFe5335 =0.30
Å(8%), δFe5406 =0.20 Å(10%) and δFe5709 =0.06 Å(6%). The
same test is also performed for the stellar population parameters,
using the methods described in Section 4, resulting in changes of
δlog Age (years)=0.05 dex, δ[Z/H]=0.48 dex, δ[α/Fe]=0.14 dex
and δ[Fe/H]=0.45 dex (see Fig. A.2). In the following analysis,
we include the results of this test in Figs. 4 and 7, when we com-
pare the dispersion due to systematic eﬀects caused by the sky
subtraction with the scatter of the measured Lick indices and
stellar population parameters.

3.3. Spatial distribution and gradients of the Lick indices

The maps of the values for six measured Lick indices are pre-
sented in Fig. 3, including Hβ, Fe5015, Mg b, Fe5270, Fe5335
and Fe5406. The index Fe5709 is not displayed in the ﬁgure be-
cause it is measured only in a fraction of our spectra, due to
issues with the red continuum for some observational masks, but
it is also used for the modelling of stellar populations whenever
possible. These maps indicate that each index has a particular
pattern, and the central region of NGC 3311 stands out by hav-

Article number, page 4 of 19

ing a relatively weaker Hβ absorption and stronger metal line
indices than the outskirts.

The large scale behavior of the Lick indices can be observed
in Fig. 4, where the Lick indices are displayed as a function
of the projected galactic log-radial distance from the centre of
NGC 3311, in units of eﬀective radius. The results from our mea-
surements are shown as circles of diﬀerent colours according to
the signal-to-noise of the spectra. We also include a comparison
with the long-slit data from the literature including Loubser et al.
(2009), Coccato et al. (2011), and Loubser & Sánchez-Blázquez
(2012). Our indices are not only in good agreement with the lit-
erature, but also complement the data from Loubser & Sánchez-
Blázquez (2012) by extending the radial coverage.

One important characteristic of Fig. 4 is the large scatter in
the external halo, as we already commented in Section 3.2. This
scatter is larger than that caused by the systematic eﬀects of
over/under subtraction of the sky by ±1%, shown in the ﬁgure
by the grey shaded areas. Hence one also expects a large true
scatter in the abundance and age distributions at large radii. Fur-
ther evidence for the intrinsic nature of the scatter at R ∼ Re
and outwards is the signiﬁcant variance of the stellar population
parameters derived for the highest S/N spectra in the data set,
shown by the dark blue circles.

Another important feature of Fig. 4 is the presence of a break
in the radial gradients, from the inner to the outer proﬁles. This
break occurs at about one eﬀective radius (Re = 8.4 kpc), which
is close to the expected transition between the in situ and ac-
creted components according to models (e.g. Cooper et al. 2015).
Therefore, to quantify the mean trends of the Lick indices we di-
vided them into two radial regions, the inner galaxy (R ≤ Re)
and the extended halo (R > Re). In each of these regions, we
measured the radial gradients using the equation

ILick(X) = ILick(0) + ∆ILick · X,
where X = log(R/Re) is the logarithm of the projected galacto-
centric distance R, normalized by the eﬀective radius Re, ILick(X)
are the corrected Lick indices as a function of X, and ∆ILick is the

the presence of an homogeneous inner region, and a large scatter at large radii, for all indices.

Notes. (1) Linear regression coeﬃcients for the Lick indices as function
of radius in the inner galaxy (R ≤ Re), derived according to equation (2),
where ILick(0) indicates the value of the indices at one eﬀective radius
and ∆ILick indicates the gradients. (2) Same as (1) for the external halo

The main result of this section is summarized in Fig. 4. The
distribution of the measured values for the Lick indices in the
inner galaxy are diﬀerent from the distribution of the values of
the same indices in the external halo. The break occurs at R =
Re for all indices. This implies that independent of the stellar
population models that may translate the equivalent widths of
the absorption features into other physically relevant quantities,
there is going to be a break in the stellar population properties
with diﬀerent values for the inner galaxy and the external halo.

4. Stellar populations
We adopted the model from Thomas et al. (2011) to derive
luminosity-weighted stellar population parameters – age, total
metallicity ([Z/H]) and alpha element abundance ([α/Fe]) –,
which are computed using a Salpeter initial stellar mass func-
tion. Also, we estimated the iron abundance using the relation
(Thomas et al. 2003)

calculated gradient. The gradient is determined from a χ2 mini-
mization weighted by the uncertainties of the data points. We do
not remove any outliers, but we implement a geometric selection
by excluding the spectra that are i) very close to NGC 3309 and
ii) on top of HCC 007. The coeﬃcients of the linear regressions

Before we describe in detail the methods to compute the stel-
lar population parameters, we list here distinct features of this
modelling approach. We assume that the single stellar popula-
tion (SSP) approximation is valid locally for each of our spectra,
while we may be observing composite stellar populations (CSP).
Each of the SSP parameters is sensitive to a diﬀerent stellar pop-
ulation, which may or may not be the one dominating the stellar
mass. In our discussion, we are going to use the interpretation
of the stellar population parameters according to Serra & Trager
(2007), which relate SSP-equivalent parameters to CSPs as fol-
lows. Ages are biased towards the age of the youngest stellar
populations, even in cases where they have only a small frac-
tion of the mass, and therefore spectra with very low ages are
not considered to be young, but instead old populations with a
contribution of young stars. In case of the element abundances,
these reﬂect the distribution of the most massive components in
the composite stellar populations and, therefore, approximately
reﬂect the mass-weighted properties.

4.1. Determination of SSP properties using Markov Chains
We used Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC, Markov 1913)
to obtain SSP parameters, θ=(logAge, [Fe/H], [α/Fe]) from the
information contained in the set of Lick indices, D, available for
each spectrum. A complete discussion of the MCMC method
can be obtained elsewhere (e.g., MacKay 2003; Wall & Jenkins
2012), and here we only summarize the main concepts. The idea
is to infer the posterior probability distribution of the parameters
given the data, p(θ|D), using Bayes’ theorem,

p(θ|D) ∝ p(θ)p(D|θ),
(4)
where p(θ) is the prior distribution and p(D|θ) is the likelihood
distribution. We assume that the priors are uniform within the
ranges of the models from Thomas et al. (2011) extrapolated in
metallicity, 0.1 ≤ Age(Gyr)≤ 15, −2.25 ≤ [Z/H] ≤ 0.90 and
−0.3 ≤ [α/Fe] ≤ 0.5, and that the likelihood distributions are
Gaussian functions with standard deviations equal to the uncer-
tainties of the measurements of the Lick indices. The calcula-
tions of the samples were performed with the PyMC package
(Patil et al. 2010) using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with
SSP models linearly interpolated for sub grid resolution.

Fig. 5 illustrates the posterior distribution in two cases. The
panels in the lower left show projections of the parameter space
which indicate that parameters are not independent from each
other. In particular, a small age-metallicity degeneracy is present
(Worthey 1994). However, the relevant statistics are obtained
by the marginalization of the parameters, indicated by the his-
tograms, which already take these eﬀects into account. For sym-
metric posterior distributions, such as the metallicities in both
examples of Fig. 5, we ﬁt a simple Gaussian in order to obtain
the mode and the standard deviation. However, in several cases
the distributions are skewed towards the limits of the models,
such as the ages in Fig. 5, which required a ﬁt of a Generalized
Extreme Value (GEV) function. In these cases, we have used the
mode as relevant statistic, and the uncertainties are calculated by
determining two iso-probability values encompassing the maxi-
mum probabilities for which the posteriori distribution integrals
add up to 68% of the area under the curve, similarly to the 1σ
deviations of a Gaussian distribution.

The results of this analysis are presented in columns 12 to
14 of Table 1. In low S/N regimes, the posterior distributions
become ﬂat due to the larger uncertainties in the Lick indices. To

avoid such unconstrained parameters in the analysis, we have set
a maximum limit of 0.2, 0.7, 0.2 and 0.8 dex in the uncertainties
of log (Age), [α/Fe], [Z/H] and [Fe/H] respectively.

4.2. Spatial distribution and gradients of SSP parameters

In Fig. 6, we present the spatial distribution of the four stellar
population parameters, i.e. log(Age), [Z/H], [α/Fe] and [Fe/H].
As observed in the distribution of Lick indices, the large scale
distribution of the stellar populations is scattered, predominantly
in the outer regions, while the inner galaxy displays a more regu-
lar behaviour. The central region shows rather old ages and super
solar abundances. The external halo is much more diverse, pre-
senting some large scale structures uncorrelated to the isophotes.
However, considering the low spatial resolution of our observa-
tions, the relative small S/N in several of these spectra, and the
expected spread in stellar populations, we consider that most of
the apparent structures may be explained by random ﬂuctuations.
To describe the large-scale distribution, we again recur to
the analysis of the radial trends and their gradients. In Fig. 7,
we plot the stellar population parameter values determined from
this work, in circles with diﬀerent grades of blue according to
their S/N, as function of both the radial distance from the cen-
tre of NGC 3311 and also as a function of the V-band surface
brightness at the location of the slits (left and central panels,
respectively). We also show the stellar population parameters
derived from the observations of Loubser & Sánchez-Blázquez
(2012) and Thomas et al. (2011), as red squares and orange tri-
angles respectively, calculated from their published values of the
Lick indices, using our MCMC approach for consistency. We
also show the central stellar population parameters from Loub-
ser et al. (2009) using a red arrow indicating the published value
in their paper.

There is a considerable scatter in the external halo proper-
ties, similarly to that of the Lick indices plotted in Fig. 4. Once
more, we compare this scatter with the systematic eﬀect of an in-
correct sky subtraction by ±1%, as displayed by the grey shaded
areas. The comparison shows that the observed scatter is larger
than that caused by a systematic eﬀect in the sky subtraction of
±1%. In order to reproduce a scatter similar to the one measured

in the external halo, an error of ∼ 6% is necessary, which is way
larger than any of the residuals in our extracted spectra. There-
fore, we have evidence that the scatter at large radii is an intrinsic
property of the external stellar halo.

Similarly to the method deployed for the Lick indices, we
quantify the radial trends in the stellar population properties us-
ing gradients which are computed separately for the inner galaxy
and the external halo. The separation between these two regions
is set at the projected distance of 1Re from the centre, which
is approximately represented by the isophotal surface bright-
ness level of µv ≈ 22.2 mag arcsec−2. We used equation (2)
to parametrize the gradients; this time we did use two param-
eters for the abscissa, X = {log(R/Re), µv}. For this calculation
of the gradients, we excluded the slits around NGC 3309 and the
three slits covering the dwarf galaxy HCC 007 at the south of
NGC 3311 to avoid contamination. One important remark is that
the stellar population gradients as function of the radius from the
centre of NGC 3311 is our primary diagnostic to characterize the
global variations in stellar population parameters, and as such, is
going to be discussed in detail in the following. We expect the
gradients as function of the local surface brightness values to be
aﬀected by the presence of substructures, as it is the case for
the external halo of NGC 3311 (see Arnaboldi et al. 2012), and
hence have a larger scatter than radial gradients.

5. Correspondence among stellar populations,

surface brightness components and kinematical
structures in the inner galaxy and external halo
of NGC 3311

The presence of a break in the measured Lick indices and the
clearly distinct distribution of the stellar population parameters
for the inner galaxy (R < Re) and the external halo point towards
diﬀerent formation channels for the stars in these two regions.
We derive consistent values for the ages, the total metallicity
and gradients in [α/Fe] and [Fe/H] with very small scatter for
the inner galaxy. The distribution of values derived for the ex-
ternal halo have a very large scatter in comparison. The ﬁndings
for the inner galaxy are consistent with the expectations from

section of each panel. The inner galaxy (R <∼10 kpc) is characterized by homogenous old age, high metallicity and super solar [α/Fe]; the outer

the in situ formation, that maintains gradients from the time of
initial rapid star formation. Diﬀerently, the larger scatter of the
values in the external halo suggests that these stars come from
the debris of gravitationally disrupted galaxies, as suggested by
classical model (Dressler 1979) for the formation of cD halos.
Thus the breaks at 1Re are interpreted as transition from the in
situ to the accreted stellar populations, and are observed in other
giant ellipticals from the MASSIVE survey (Greene et al. 2013,
2015).

In NGC 3311, such a break in the stellar properties of the in-
ner galaxy and the external halo correlates with variations of the
velocity dispersion proﬁle. Within one Re, stars move under the

inﬂuence of the galaxy mass, reaching a σ0 ≈ 160 km s−1 at the
centre. At one Re and slightly larger radii, the line-of-sight (LOS)
velocity dispersion has a positive gradient reaching σ(R) ≈ 400
km s−1 at 30 kpc (Ventimiglia et al. 2010; Richtler et al. 2011,
Paper II). Such an increase in σ(R) with radius indicates that the
stars are progressively driven by the massive external halo as-
sociated with the Hydra I cluster, as mapped by the hot X-ray
emission (Hayakawa et al. 2004).

We now discuss the properties of the external halo of
NGC 3311, deﬁned as the region R > Re. This halo is not ho-
mogeneous, and the presence of additional components can be
physically motivated. Using deep V-band imaging, Arnaboldi

azimuthally-averaged gradients and the large scatter in the outer halo are consistent with the results of accreted stars from a variety of diﬀerent
progenitors.

et al. (2012) showed that the light of NGC 3311 is described
primarily by a single Sérsic function with index n ≈ 10 at all
radii. There is no break or no photometric signature of the two-
component structure expected in a cD galaxy: the cluster domi-
nated halo is not obvious in the photometry. This Sérsic n = 10
component centred on NGC 3311 ﬁts most of the light at all
directions and is responsible for the featureless appearance ob-
served in the panel A of Fig. 8. However, once the symmetric
main component is subtracted oﬀ, Arnaboldi et al. (2012) de-
tected an additional feature in the galaxy light, the oﬀ-centred
envelope, that is located at a projected distance of 18 kpc from
the centre of NGC 3311, towards the North-East direction (panel
B of Fig. 8). At the location of the oﬀ-centred envelope, there is
an excess emission in X-rays (Hayakawa et al. 2004, 2006, see
panel C) and a group of dwarf galaxies are found around this
position, with high relative LOS velocities of ∼ 1000 km s−1

(Misgeld et al. 2008) with respect of the systemic velocity of the
Hydra I cluster. At the optical wavelengths, the oﬀ-centred enve-
lope is fainter than the symmetric main halo, contributing up to
a fraction of ≈ 30% of the light (Coccato et al. 2011; Arnaboldi
et al. 2012).

The oﬀ-centred envelope is also associated with kinemati-
cal signatures. Ventimiglia et al. (2011) showed that the line-of-
sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) of planetary nebulae in the
cluster core around NGC 3311 halo is multi-peaked, with three
distinct components: a broad asymmetric component with ve-
locities of ∼ 3100 km s−1, a blue-shifted north-south elongated
component at ∼ 1800 km s−1 and a red-shifted component at
∼ 5000 km s−1, at the location of the oﬀ-centred envelope. Fur-
thermore Arnaboldi et al. (2012) showed that asymmetric fea-
tures in the velocity dispersion and the LOS velocity proﬁles cor-
relate with the spatial location of the oﬀ-centred envelope. That

is, at the location of the envelope, the LOS velocities (LOSVs)
are redshifted with respect to the centre of NGC 3311 and the
velocity dispersion is larger than at the symmetric location in
the external halo, opposite the galaxy centre. Such features can
be explained by the superposition along the LOS of two distinct
structural components, the Sérsic n=10 halo and the oﬀ-centred
envelope, with diﬀerent LOSVs by ≥ 50 kms−1.

Therefore, the external halo properties may be associated
with two structural components: the “symmetric” Sérsic n = 10
halo, which is found at all azimuthal angles, and the oﬀ-centred
envelope in the North East quadrant. The exact boundaries of
these components are not well deﬁned, hence we adopt a simple
scheme to seek for their signatures in the distribution of the pa-
rameters for the stellar populations. The properties of the stellar
population in the symmetric external halo are derived for R > Re
and 90◦ ≤ PA ≤ 360◦, while the population of the oﬀ-centred
halo is studied in the quadrant at 0◦ < PA < 90◦. As the symmet-

ric halo contributes 70% or even larger fractions to the light at
the location of the oﬀ-centred envelope, we would expect to only
detect small variations in the distributions of the stellar popula-
tion parameters at the location of the oﬀ-centred envelope with
respect to the symmetric halo distribution.

6. Properties of the stellar populations of the stellar

light in NGC 3311

6.1. Stellar populations in the inner galaxy
The stellar population properties of the inner galaxy (R (cid:46) Re)
have well constrained values as indicated by the blue histograms
on the right side of Fig. 7. The radial linear gradients of the
stellar parameters are minor. There are three deviating data
points: one at the position of the dust lane in the central kpc
of NGC 3311 (Arnaboldi et al. 2012), and two in other regions

C. E. Barbosa et al.: The Hydra I cluster core I. Stellar populations in the cD galaxy NGC 3311

further out, see Loubser et al. (2009) and Loubser & Sánchez-
Blázquez (2012),

The stars of the inner galaxy are old, compatible with the
oldest modelled stellar populations (15 Gyr), with no gradient
in age. The total metallicity of the stars is super solar, with a
mild gradient of −0.23±0.18 dex dex−1, while the alpha element
abundance is high at the centre, [α/Fe]≈ 0.2 dex, with a positive
gradient of 0.18 ± 0.06 dex dex−1. The resulting iron abundance
is close to solar with a gradient of −0.16 ± 0.08 dex dex−1.

The very old age of NGC 3311 is expected for BCGs. Oliva-
Altamirano et al. (2015) observed that one-third of their BCG
sample has similarly old stellar populations (age > 12 Gyr),
while Loubser et al. (2009) found that about 50% of the BCGs
have central old stellar populations. The ﬂat age gradient and the
abundance gradients are consistent with the values observed in
BCGs by Oliva-Altamirano et al. (2015).

6.2. Stellar populations in the external halo
The properties of the outer stellar halo of NGC 3311 are con-
siderably diﬀerent from those inferred for the inner galaxy,
as shown in Fig. 7, left and central panels at R (cid:38) Re and
µv (cid:38) 22.2 mag arcsec−2. We detect a shallow age gradient of
∆ log Age = −0.02 ± 0.02 dex dex−1 in the external halo, which
is compatible with the ﬂat gradient in the inner galaxy. The to-
tal metallicity gradient is steeper than that of the inner galaxy,
with ∆[Z/H] = −0.46 ± 0.39 dex dex−1, and an inversion of the
radial trends is observed in the alpha element abundance, with
∆[α/Fe] = −0.20± 0.22 dex dex−1, and in the abundance of iron,
with ∆[Fe/H] = 0.14 ± 0.43 dex dex−1.

In addition to the average radial trends, the clear feature of
the outer stellar halo of NGC 3311 is the considerable larger
scatter of the stellar population parameters. The histograms on
the right side of Fig. 7, show the distribution of stellar popula-
tion properties for the inner galaxy (blue) and outer stellar halo
(gray). The large scatter is present for the SSP parameters of high
S/N (≥ 40) spectra and at a radius of R ∼ 0.6Re = 5.3 kpc, as
indicated by the dark blue circles in the radial plots for [Z/H],
[α/Fe] and [Fe/H] in Fig. 7. Moreover, the width of the distri-
bution of the stellar population parameters is larger than what is
expected from a systematic error in the sky subtraction of ±1%,
as indicated by the grey shaded areas shown around the mean
gradients.

In the histograms on the right side of Fig. 7, the positions of
the mean peak of the distributions and their widths are diﬀerent
in the inner galaxy and external halo. A common characteristic
of these distributions is that their widths for the external halo
are twice as large as those for the inner galaxy. In the case of
the [Z/H] and [α/Fe] distributions, there are multiple peaks for
the external halo. Therefore, contrary to the inner galaxy, which
can be explained by a rapid process of collapse and merger of
gas-rich lumps, the outer stellar halo was most likely built up
by accretion of stars from a variety of progenitors, with diﬀerent
masses and star formation histories.

We now investigate whether there are diﬀerences in the stel-
lar population parameters between the oﬀ-centred envelope and
the rest of the external halo of NGC 3311. Fig. 9 shows the dis-
tribution of the stellar population parameters for the oﬀ-centred
envelope (red) and the rest of the external halo (grey). To deter-
mine the number of peaks that are statistically signiﬁcant in each
case, we have used Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to esti-
mate the number of populations which minimize the Bayesian
Information Criteria (BIC), whose results are summarized in Ta-
ble 5. The [α/Fe] distributions for the oﬀ-centred envelope and

Fig. 9. Distribution of stellar population parameters of the oﬀ-centred

malized, and the number of spectra (N) used in each case is shown in
the legend of each panel. Dashed lines indicate the components of the
GMM analysis, while the arrows indicate the position of the peak of
each component. The oﬀ-centred envelope is responsible for a signiﬁ-
cant shift of the metallicity where it is located, while ages and alpha-
element abundance distributions are similar to those inferred for the
symmetric halo.

symmetric halo are those for which two components are statis-
tically favoured with respect to the single peak distribution. The
distributions for the ages and metallicities can be relatively well
described by single Gaussian functions instead. The GMM mod-
els are shown in Fig. 9 by dashed lines, with arrows indicating
the position of the peak for each component.

We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to statistically
compare the distributions of the stellar population parameters
for the oﬀ-centred envelope and the symmetric halo. The result
of the KS tests indicates that the age and the alpha element abun-
dances of these two components may have been drawn from
the same parent distribution, with probabilities of 78 and 32%
respectively. In both components, stars are predominantly old,
with ages of ∼14 Gyr, compatible with the oldest stellar popu-
lations in the models of Thomas et al. (2011). This old age dis-
tribution extends the results from Coccato et al. (2011) to the
entire halo, and is also supported by the lack of features in the
UV emission from GALEX observations (Gil de Paz et al. 2007).
The age is the only external halo property for which the gradient
is representative of the vast majority of the observed data points.
The distribution of alpha element abundance in the sym-
metric halo and in the oﬀ-centred envelope show similar multi-
modal distributions, modelled as a mixture of two Gaussian com-
ponents. The main contribution to the alpha element abundance
are stars with [α/Fe]≈ 0.4 dex and spread of 0.1 dex, observed in
64% of the cases, while the secondary population has an abun-
dance of [α/Fe]≈ −0.1 dex and spread of 0.15 dex. The expla-
nation for almost identical alpha element abundance at the oﬀ-
centred envelope and in the symmetric halo is that this property
is robust against a contamination of a minor component to the

([Z/H]= −0.34 dex, [α/Fe]=0.50 dex) with the properties of the
dwarf galaxy HCC 026 ([Z/H]= −0.85 dex, [α/Fe]=0.03 dex),
they have noticed that a fraction of 35% in the light is necessary
to decrease the element abundance by only 0.05 dex. There may
be speciﬁc regions in the oﬀ-centred envelope where this frac-
tion may be slightly larger, especially at those regions with the
largest velocity dispersion observed in Paper II but, considering
the total light, the fraction of light at the sub structure should not
exceed 30%, conﬁrming the ﬁndings of Coccato et al. (2011) and
in agreement with the estimates of Arnaboldi et al. (2012).

Diﬀerently from the age and [α/Fe] distributions, the total
metallicity and the iron abundance distributions do diﬀer be-
tween the oﬀ-centred envelope and the symmetric halo. The
probability that these distributions are drawn from the same par-
ent distributions are low, i.e. ∼1% and ∼ 3%, respectively. The
total metallicity distribution of the oﬀ-centred envelope is most
discrepant. The diﬀerence is clearly shown in Fig. 9: the metal-
licity distribution of the stellar populations at the location of
the oﬀ-set envelope is a single peaked distribution centred at
[Z/H]= 0.1 dex and width of 0.33 dex, while the metallicity of
the symmetric halo is a much broader distribution, with mean
value [Z/H]= −0.24 dex and width of 0.64 dex. The stars in the
quadrant where the oﬀ-centred envelope is located have higher
metallicities than most of the stars at the same radii, except for
the stars sampled by spectra extracted in proximity of the gi-
ant companion NGC 3309. A similar result holds for the iron
abundance, with the symmetric halo having [Fe/H]= −0.38 dex
and dispersion of 0.68 dex, while the mean abundances of the
oﬀ-centred envelope is [Fe/H]= −0.12 with a dispersion of 0.41
dex. Since the light at the location of the oﬀ-centred envelope is
given by the superposition of this component and the symmetric
halo, the intrinsic metallicity of the stars in the envelope may be
signiﬁcantly higher than solar.

Our derived stellar population parameters for the external
halo of NGC 3311 are compatible with the previous results from
Coccato et al. (2011), and are similar to the stellar populations
of other cD galaxy halos, such as NGC 4889 in the Coma cluster
(Coccato et al. 2010b) and NGC 6166 in the Abell 2199 cluster
(Bender et al. 2015). These physical properties are also similar
to those inferred for the stellar populations in other BCGs (Spo-
laor et al. 2008) and massive early-type galaxies (Spolaor et al.
2010; Greene et al. 2012, 2013, 2015).

7. Implications for the assembly history of

NGC 3311

Recent cosmological models for the formation of large early-
type galaxies predict that the majority of stars in the external ha-
los originated from satellite galaxies in the so-called two-phase
scenario (e.g. De Lucia & Blaizot 2007; Naab et al. 2009; Oser
et al. 2010; Cooper et al. 2013). In the next sections, we are going
to compare our results with recent modelling of BCGs in order to
relate the inferred distributions of the stellar population parame-
ters with the physical mechanisms involved in the formation of
extended halos of BCGs in clusters.

7.1. The inner galaxy

As presented in the previous sections, the distribution and the
distinct radial gradients of the age, [Z/H], [Fe/H] and [α/Fe]
of the stellar populations in the inner galaxy are consistent
with stars born in situ. According to models of Cooper et al.
(2013), the large fraction of in situ stars in the central regions
of BCGs is expected to occur up to a stellar mass threshold of
M200 (cid:46) 1013M(cid:12), as for more massive galaxies the accreted stars
become increasingly dominant even in their innermost regions
(Cooper et al. 2015). NGC 3311 is very close to this boundary,
with M200 ≈ 0.63M500 = 6.3·1013M(cid:12) (Piﬀaretti et al. 2011), and
our determination of the stellar population parameters show the
presence of in situ and accreted stars in two radial regions, hence
in agreement with the predictions of Cooper et al. (2013).

We can also compare our results with those for other massive
early-type galaxies. The total metallicity gradient of the inner
galaxy in NGC 3311, ∆[Z/H]= −0.23±0.18 dex dex−1, is compa-
rable to the gradients of other BCG galaxies (Oliva-Altamirano
et al. 2015) and non-BCGs (Kuntschner et al. 2010). Positive
[α/Fe] gradients are also common among early-type galaxies
(Kuntschner et al. 2010) and BCGs (Brough et al. 2007) and,
therefore, the mechanisms that set the gradients in BCGs must be
similar to those that form ordinary early-type galaxies. In a sim-
ple, quasi-monolithic scenario, such gradients can be explained
in an outside-in scenario (e.g., Pipino et al. 2006, 2008, 2010).
In this context, early-type galaxies are formed by the merging
of gas-rich lumps which produces an intense star formation, but
with a diﬀerential rate at diﬀerent radii. Star formation in the
outer regions around 1Re is characterized by short time-scales
and strong stellar winds that deplete the iron eﬃciently, whereas
star formation is the core is prolonged and metals, in particular
iron, are kept due to the strong gravitational potential. This pro-
duces positive alpha element gradients and negative total metal-
licity gradients. The abundance gradients of the inner galaxy of
NGC 3311 are compatible with the results of such models con-
sidering a few episodes of dry mergers (Pipino et al. 2010).

7.2. The extended symmetric halo
With reference to the main peak of the alpha element abundance
distribution, see Fig. 9, the extended halo can be described as a
mix of old stars, with metallicities of [Z/H]≈ −0.25 and [α/Fe]≈
0.4, at ﬁrst order. As discussed earlier, the high value for the α
abundance does not imply that all stars were formed in galaxies
with high [α/Fe], as this quantity does not change a lot by the
contamination of less alpha enhanced stars. Still the majority of
the stars in the external halo may have indeed high [α/Fe]. In the
nearby universe, high [α/Fe] stars are those:

1. Stars produced in disky galaxies with truncated star forma-
tion. Greene et al. (2012, 2013) have shown that the metallic-
ity and the alpha element abundance at the outskirts of mas-
sive galaxies are similar to those found in the Milk-Way thick
disk, which is predicted to have been formed in short time-
scales (Chiappini et al. 1997). These disks could have been
destroyed in interactions and mergers very early, as galaxy
encounters at high redshift were much more common than at
the present day universe.
2. Stars from galaxies in compact groups. de la Rosa et al.
(2007) have found that galaxies with σ0 (cid:46) 160 km s−1 in
Hickson Compact Groups have larger [Mg/Fe] and lower
[Z/H] compared to ﬁeld galaxies of similar masses, and pro-
posed that such galaxies may have their otherwise extended
star formation quenched by mergers.

3. Stars in the outskirts of massive early-type galaxies with de-
clining metallicity gradients and ﬂat-to-positive alpha ele-
ment gradients (Coccato et al. 2011). Negative metallicity
gradients extending to the outer radii are found in most early-
type galaxies (e.g. Baes et al. 2007; La Barbera et al. 2012).
Flat and positive [α/Fe] gradients are commonly found in
early-type galaxies at small radii (Kuntschner et al. 2010),
and there is evidence that at least metallicity gradients ex-
tend to larger radii (La Barbera et al. 2012; Pastorello et al.
2014). In other nearby clusters, such as Virgo and Fornax,
declining metallicity gradients and ﬂat alpha element abun-
dances are found in almost all cases (Spolaor et al. 2010), but
there is no such information for the giant ellipticals in the
Hydra I cluster. If those have similar gradients, the central
stellar populations of the Hydra I ellipticals should exhibit
high [Z/H] and [α/Fe], similar to those in the extended halo
of NGC 3311 (Coccato et al. 2011).

All of the above galaxies could have provided stars that are
now found to contribute most of the light of the symmetric ex-
ternal halo. They do not exclude each other necessarily, as they
could have been diﬀerent parts of the same process in a hierarchi-
cal scenario. More importantly, however, is that the high [α/Fe]
indicates star formation happening on short time-scales of ≈ 0.1
Gyr, according to the approximation of Thomas et al. (2005).
We can also estimate the most likely masses of the progenitors
of the stars in the external halo from the metallicity distribution
in Fig. 9. Translating these metallicities into stellar masses ac-
cording to the relations from Gallazzi et al. (2005), the typical
galaxy contributing to the formation of the extended symmetric
halo are Milky Way-like galaxies, including mostly galaxies in
the range ∼ 1010M(cid:12) to ∼ 1012M(cid:12).

The extrapolation of the inner galaxy gradient in [α/Fe]
matches the position of the dominant alpha element abundance
in the external halo, indicating that these stars may have simi-
lar origins. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from Mu-
rante et al. (2007) indeed indicate that most of the diﬀuse halo
is composed of stars liberated from the most massive galaxies

in episodes of major mergers related to the formation of the cD
galaxy, where tidal shocking and stripping of massive galaxies
are able to unbound up to 30% of their stellar mass. In agree-
ment with several predictions from the models of Murante et al.
(2007), semi-analytical models of Contini et al. (2014), includ-
ing disruption of galaxies and tidal interactions, are able to re-
produce both the typical masses of the progenitors in our obser-
vations as well as the typical total metallicities. Therefore, our
observations are in agreement with models in which the assem-
bly of the BCG is directly connected with the formation of the
diﬀuse halo.

The [α/Fe] distribution of the symmetric halo indicates the
presence of a secondary population, with solar and sub-solar α-
abundances. These lower alpha element abundances suggest a
much more extended star formation, ∼15 Gyr, according to the
approximation of Thomas et al. (2005). In this case, there is al-
ready one galaxy in the Hydra I cluster which has similar prop-
erties, the dwarf galaxy HCC 026. This dwarf galaxy has solar
alpha-abundance, [α/Fe]= −0.03±0.05 dex, and low metallicity,
[Z/H]=−0.85 ± 0.03 (Coccato et al. 2011). HCC 026 is part of a
group of dwarf galaxies at the same location of the oﬀ-centred
envelope (Misgeld et al. 2008) and it has strong tidal tails that in-
dicate that this galaxy is being disrupted by the tidal ﬁeld close
to the cluster centre (Arnaboldi et al. 2012). Hence HCC 026 is
the typical object that contributes to the late accretion events that
build up the halo today.

Such solar and sub-solar α abundance populations are in-
ferred from a substantial fraction of the extracted spectra, in
about 40% of the total sample in the external halo. Hence ac-
cretion of stars from disrupted dwarfs or irregular galaxies is an
important channel for the late build-up of the external halo. Very
recent observations of the planetary nebulae in the halo of M87
and the intracluster light in the Virgo core showed that the contri-
bution from Magellanic clouds-like irregular galaxies is respon-
sible for a sizeable fraction of the halo light being added in the
last Gyr to the M87 halo and ICL (Longobardi et al. 2015a,b).
Models from Murante et al. (2007) indicate that low-mass galax-
ies (M∗ < 1010M(cid:12)) may contribute to the formation of the dif-
fuse halo, but numerical issues related to the particle resolution
of low-mass galaxies did not allow them to set proper constraints
on this secondary population.

Our current results for NGC 3311 and the recent ﬁndings for
M87 indicate that it is of importance to study the details of the
late mass accretion, which is responsible for a sizeable fraction
of the chemical composition and kinematics of the halos of mas-
sive nearby galaxies.

7.3. The metallicity distribution of the off-centred envelope
The stellar populations located at the oﬀ-centred envelope show
an enhancement of metals in comparison with the rest of the
symmetric halo, while the alpha element abundance and age dis-
tributions are similar. The strongly peaked metallicity distribu-
tion centred around [Z/H]≈ 0.1 indicates that the stars associated
with the substructure were formed in massive galaxies. Accord-
ing to Murante et al. (2007), massive ellipticals can lose up to
30% of their stars during their merging events with the cD and
these stars would then contribute to the build up of the external
halo. One can then ask how this external high metallicity halo
component acquired an oﬀset and became oﬀ-centred with re-
spect to the high surface brightness, highly concentrated inner
galaxy.

Oﬀ-centred outer components in BGCs are rather frequent:
for a sample of 24 clusters, Gonzalez et al. (2005) showed that a

Article number, page 13 of 19

A&A proofs: manuscript no. main

two-component ﬁt to the light proﬁles of BCGs provides an im-
proved match to the data and that the two photometric compo-
nents are misaligned in 60% of the sample. In the Gonzalez et al.
(2005) sample, the cluster Abell 1651 has a cD galaxy where the
two components have diﬀerent centres, with the outer compo-
nent being oﬀ-centred by 15 kpc linear distance in projection, i.e.
very similar to what is observed for NGC 3311. As observed in
cosmological simulations (e.g. Murante et al. 2007), the highly
radial orbits of the dark halos of massive ellipticals and their
tidal interaction with the cD dark halo may cause a deﬂection of
the central part of the cD from its dark halo, while the outer en-
velopes maintain their orbital directions, thus creating an oﬀset
between core and halo in the cD galaxy. Candidate dark halos re-
sponsible for a tidal interaction with NGC 3311 are the dark halo
associated with the group of infalling dwarfs or the dark halo as-
sociated with NGC 3309. These tidal interactions would then be
similar to what is observed in the Coma cluster core (Gerhard
et al. 2007). Such mechanisms may also explain the gas strip-
ping of NGC 3311 as observed in the X-rays Hayakawa et al.
(2004, 2006), as the mass of the gas is compatible with the mass
of NGC 3311.

8. Summary and conclusions
We performed a spatially extended survey of the stellar popula-
tions in NGC 3311, the brightest galaxy of the Hydra I cluster.
By the analysis of the absorption line equivalent widths using
a Bayesian framework with Monte Carlo Markov Chains, we
probed luminosity-weighted parameters – age, [Z/H], [α/Fe] and
[Fe/H] – out to ∼ 3Re. This enabled the characterisation of the
stellar content of three physically motivated components of this
system: the inner galaxy, the symmetric external halo and the
oﬀ-centred envelope.

The inner stellar halo (R < Re) presents stellar popula-
tions typical of massive early-type galaxies, including old ages,
high metallicities and high alpha element abundances. Similar to
other BCGs, the inner galaxy has a well-deﬁned negative metal-
licity and positive alpha element abundance gradient which can
be explained by a quasi-monolithic scenario involving a few dry
mergers. These gradients and the smaller velocity dispersion of
the inner galaxy are clear indications that the stars in this region
were formed in situ in the early phases of galaxy formation.

The stellar component of the outer symmetric stellar halo
is characterized by a large spread of the stellar parameter val-
ues rather than by clearly deﬁned radial gradients. This region
is characterized also by high velocity dispersions which are in-
dicative that these stars are driven by the cluster’s potential and
are generated by accumulation of tidal debris. While the mean
value of the metallicity distribution in this region indicates sub-
solar abundances, the [α/Fe] distribution of the symmetric halo is
bimodal, with high (∼0.4) and low (∼0) components. The major-
ity of stars in the symmetric halo are generated in galaxies with
a rapid star formation and short time-scales, in agreement with
models for the formation of cD envelopes (e.g. Murante et al.
2004, 2007; Contini et al. 2014). However, a substantial fraction
of stars, about 40%, has a low [α/Fe] value, which indicates that
stars from less massive galaxies are also added to the cD halo.
Their association with dwarf galaxies currently being disrupted
at the position of the oﬀ-set envelope indicate that the growth of
the cD halo is an on-going process, which is fed by late mass
accretion.

Finally, the stellar populations at the position of the oﬀ-
centred envelope, a substructure also observed in photometry,
X-rays and kinematics, indicates that the dark matter halo of an

Article number, page 14 of 19

infalling group may have interacted with the BCG halo, causing
the stripping of gas and stars.

We conclude that massive satellite galaxies in the vicinity of
NGC 3311 merged with the central cD in early times and formed
its symmetric outer halo, while at present time the build up pro-
cess of the extended halo is still on-going, as indicated by the
presence of an infalling group of dwarfs that are adding their
stars to the halo now. Tidal interactions between the dark halos
of the infalling group, of NGC 3309 and NGC 3311 may be re-
sponsible for the stripping of stars and gas in the halo of NGC
3311. Although very challenging from the observational point of
view, the halos of cD galaxies provide important constraints on
the formation and morphological transformation of galaxies in
nearby clusters.
