ADAMS-SPANNE TYPE ESTIMATES FOR CERTAIN

SUBLINEAR OPERATORS AND THEIR COMMUTATORS

GENERATED BY FRACTIONAL INTEGRALS IN

GENERALIZED MORREY SPACES ON HEISENBERG GROUPS

AND SOME APPLICATIONS

F.GURBUZ

Abstract. In this paper we consider the Spanne type boundedness of sublin-
ear operators and prove the Adams type boundedness theorems for these oper-
ators and also give BM O (bounded mean oscillation space) estimates for their
commutators in generalized Morrey spaces on Heisenberg groups. The bound-
edness conditions are formulated in terms of Zygmund type integral inequali-
ties. Based on the properties of the fundamental solution of the sub-Laplacian
on Heisenberg groups, we prove the the boundedness of some Schr¨odinger type
operators and their commutators in generalized Morrey spaces.

1. Introduction

Heisenberg groups appear in quantum physics and many parts of mathematics,
including Fourier analysis, several complex variables, geometry and topology. It is
a remarkable fact that the Heisenberg group, denoted by Hn, arises in two aspects.
On the one hand, it can be realized as the boundary of the unit ball in several
complex variables. On the other hand, an important aspect of the study of the
Heisenberg group is the background of physics, namely, the mathematical ideas
connected with the fundamental notions of quantum mechanics. In other words,
there is its genesis in the context of quantum mechanics which emphasizes its sym-
plectic role in the theory of theta functions and related parts of analysis. Analysis
on the groups is also motivated by their role as the simplest and the most important
model in the general theory of vector ﬁelds satisfying H¨ormander’s condition. Due
to this reason, many interesting works have been devoted to the theory of harmonic
analysis on Hn in [6, 9, 11, 28, 29, 36].

We start with some basic results concerning Heisenberg group in generalized
Morrey spaces and refer the reader to [9, 11, 36] and the references therein for more
details. Let Hn be the 2n+1-dimensional Heisenberg group. That is, Hn = R2n×R,
with multiplication

(x, t) (y, s) = (x + y, t + s + 2 Im (xy)) ,

where xy =

nXj=1

xj yj and Im (xy) =

nXj=1

(xn+j yj − xjyn+j). The inverse element of

g = (x, t) is g−1 = (−x, −t) and we write the identity of Hn as e = (0, 0). The
Heisenberg group is a connected, simply connected nilpotent Lie group. We deﬁne
one-parameter dilations on Hn for r > 0 by the formula

These dilations are group automorphisms and Jacobian determinant is rQ, where
Q = 2n + 2 is the homogeneous dimension of Hn. The homogeneous norm on Hn
is given by the formula

δr (x, t) =(cid:0)rx, r2t(cid:1) .

|g| = |(x, t)| =(cid:16)|x|2 + |t|(cid:17) 1

2

.

This norm satisﬁes the triangle inequality and leads to the left-invariant distance

d (g, h) =(cid:12)(cid:12)g−1h(cid:12)(cid:12). Using this norm, we deﬁne the Heisenberg ball

B (g, r) =(cid:8)h ∈ Hn :(cid:12)(cid:12)g−1h(cid:12)(cid:12) < r(cid:9)

with center g = (x, t) and radius r and denote by BC (g, r) = Hn \ B (g, r) its
complement, and we denote by Br = B (e, r) = {h ∈ Hn : |h| < r} the open ball
centered at e, the identity element of Hn, with radius r. The volume of the ball
B (g, r) is cnrQ, where cn is the volume of the unit ball B1:

cn = |B (e, 1)| =

2πn+ 1

2(cid:1)
2 Γ(cid:0) n
2 (cid:1) .
(n + 1) Γ (n) Γ(cid:0) n+1

Using the coordinates g = (x, t) for points in Hn, we can write the left-invariant
, ∂
∂t at the origin as

vector ﬁelds X1, . . . , X2n, X2n+1 on Hn equal to ∂

These 2n + 1 vector ﬁelds form a basis for the Lie algebra of Hn with the commu-
tation relations

[Xj, Xn+j] = −4X2n+1,

j = 1, . . . , n,

whereas the other commutators vanish (equal to e). The potential and related
topics on the Heisenberg group we consider the sub-Laplacian ∆Hn deﬁned by the
formula

∆Hn = −

2nXj=1

X 2
j

and the gradient ∇Hn is deﬁned as

∇Hn = (X1, . . . , X2n) .

It is known that the sub-Laplacian operator ∆Hn (which is hypoelliptic by
H¨ormander’s theorem [18]) is well known to play the same fundamental role on
Hn as the ordinary does on Rn.

In the study of local properties of solutions to of second order elliptic partial dif-
ferential equations(PDEs), together with weighted Lebesgue spaces, Morrey spaces
Mp,λ (Hn) play an important role, see [12, 20]. They were introduced by Morrey in

ADAMS-SPANNE TYPE ESTIMATES FOR CERTAIN SUBLINEAR OPERATORS

1938 [27]. In recent years there has been an explosion of interest in the study of the
boundedness of operators on Morrey-type spaces. It has been obtained that many
properties of solutions to PDEs are concerned with the boundedness of some oper-
ators on Morrey-type spaces. In fact, better inclusion between Morrey and H¨older
spaces permits to obtain higher regularity of the solutions to diﬀerent elliptic and
parabolic boundary problems. We recall its deﬁnition on a Heisenberg group as

Mp,λ (Hn) =(cid:26)f : kf kMp,λ(Hn) = sup

g∈Hn,r>0

r− λ

p kf kLp(B(g,r)) < ∞(cid:27) ,

where f ∈ Lloc

p (Hn), 0 ≤ λ ≤ Q and 1 ≤ p < ∞.

Note that Mp,0 = Lp(Hn) and Mp,Q = L∞(Hn).

If λ < 0 or λ > Q, then
Mp,λ = Θ, where Θ is the set of all functions equivalent to 0 on Hn . It is known
that Mp,λ(Hn) is an expansion of Lp(Hn).

We also denote by W Mp,λ ≡ W Mp,λ(Hn) the weak Morrey space of all functions

f ∈ W Lloc

p (Hn) for which

kf kW Mp,λ

≡ kf kW Mp,λ(Hn) = sup

g∈Hn,r>0

where W Lp(B(g, r)) denotes the weak Lp-space of measurable functions f for which

Here g∗ denotes the non-increasing rearrangement of a function g.

Note that

W Lp (Hn) = W Lp,0 (Hn) , Mp,λ (Hn) ⊂ W Mp,λ (Hn)

and

kf kW Mp,λ(Hn) ≤ kf kMp,λ(Hn) .

Let |B(g, r)| be the Haar measure of the ball B(g, r). Let f be a given integrable
function on a ball B (g, r) ⊂ G. The fractional maximal function Mαf , 0 ≤ α < Q,
of f is deﬁned by the formula

Mαf (g) = sup

In the case of α = 0, the fractional maximal function Mαf coincides with the

to the fractional integral

In [39], relations between the Riesz potential and the heat kernel on the Heisen-
berg group are studied. The following assertion [[39], Theorem 4.2] yields an ex-
pression for Iα, which allows us to discuss the boundedness of the Riesz potential.

The Riesz potential Iα satisﬁes the estimate [[39], Theorem 4.4]

|Iαf (g)| . T αf (g) ,

which provides a suitable estimate for the Riesz potential on the Heisenberg group.
An early impetus to the study of fractional integrals originated from the problem
of fractional derivation, see e.g. [32]. Besides its contributions to harmonic analysis,
fractional integrals also play an essential role in many other ﬁelds. The H-L Sobolev
inequality about fractional integral is still an indispensable tool to establish time-
space estimates for the heat semigroup of nonlinear evolution equations, for some
of this work, see e.g. [19]. In recent times, the applications to Chaos and Fractal
have become another motivation to study fractional integrals, see e.g.
[22]. It is
well known that, see [9, 36] for example, T α is bounded from Lp (Hn) to Lq (Hn)
for all p > 1 and 1
Hardy-Littlewood Sobolev inequality).

Q > 0, and T α is also of weak type (cid:16)1, Q

Spanne (published by Peetre [33]) and Adams [1] have studied boundedness of
the fractional integral operator T α on Mp,λ (Rn). This result has been reproved by
Chiarenza and Frasca [5]. Using the more general results of Guliyev [13, 14, 15],
it is possible to prove the following generalization of the results of [1, 5, 33] to the
case of the Heisenberg group (see also [26]).

for the boundedness of the operators Mα and T α from Mp,λ (Hn) to Mq,λ (Hn).

(2) If p = 1, then the condition 1 − 1

Q−λ is necessary and suﬃcient for the

boundedness of the operators Mα and T α from M1,λ (Hn) to W Mq,λ (Hn).

If α = Q

Littlewood Sobolev inequality.

We recall that, for 0 < α < Q

Hence Theorem 2 implies the boundedness of the fractional maximal operator

Mα, where υn = |B (e, 1)| is the volume of the unit ball on Hn.

Suppose that Tα, α ∈ (0, Q) represents a linear or a sublinear operator, which

satisﬁes that for any f ∈ L1(Hn) with compact support and x /∈ suppf

|Tαf (g)| ≤ c0Z

where c0 is independent of f and g.

For a locally integrable function b on Hn, suppose that the commutator operator
Tb,α, α ∈ (0, Q) represents a linear or a sublinear operator, which satisﬁes that for
any f ∈ L1(Hn) with compact support and x /∈ suppf

|Tb,αf (g)| ≤ c0Z

Hn

|b(g) − b(h)|

|f (h)|

where c0 is independent of f and g.

We point out that the condition (1.1) in the case of α = 0 has been introduced
by Soria and Weiss in [34]. The condition (1.1) is satisﬁed by many interesting
operators in harmonic analysis, such as fractional maximal operator, fractional
Marcinkiewicz operator, fractional integral operator and so on (see [25], [34] for
details).

Let b be a locally integrable function on Hn, then for 0 < α < Q, we deﬁne
the linear commutator generated by fractional integral operator and b and the
sublinear commutator of the fractional maximal operator as follows, respectively
(see also [25]).

In the ﬁrst part of this work, we prove the Spanne type boundedness of the
sublinear operators Tα, α ∈ (0, Q) satisfying condition (1.1) generated by fractional
integrals from one generalized Morrey space Mp,ϕ1 (Hn) to another Mq,ϕ2 (Hn),
where 1 < p < q < ∞, 1

In the second part of this work, provided that b ∈ BM O (Hn) (bounded mean
oscillation) and Tb,α, α ∈ (0, Q) satisfying condition (1.2) is a sublinear operator,
we ﬁnd the suﬃcient conditions on the pair (ϕ1, ϕ2) which ensures the Spanne type
boundedness of the commutator operators Tb,α from Mp,ϕ1 (Hn) to Mq,ϕ2 (Hn),
where 1 < p < q < ∞, 0 < α < Q
Q . We also ﬁnd the suﬃcient
conditions on ϕ which ensures the Adams type boundedness of the commutator
(Hn) for 1 < p < q < ∞. In all
operators Tb,α from M
the cases the conditions for the boundedness of Tα and Tb,α are given in terms of
Zygmund-type (supremal-type) integral inequalities on (ϕ1, ϕ2) and ϕ which do not
assume any assumption on monotonicity of ϕ1, ϕ2 and ϕ in r. Let L = −∆Hn + V
be a Schr¨odinger operator on Hn, where ∆Hn is the sub-Laplacian.

Finally, as applications we establish the boundedness of some Schr¨odinger type
operators V γ (−∆Hn + V )−β and V γ∇Hn (−∆Hn + V )−β and their commutators
on generalized Morrey spaces related to certain nonnegative potentials V belonging
to the reverse H¨older class B∞ (Hn).

By A . B we mean that A ≤ CB with some positive constant C independent
of appropriate quantities. If A . B and B . A, we write A ≈ B and say that A
and B are equivalent.

2. Generalized Morrey spaces on Heisenberg groups

It is convenient to deﬁne the generalized Morrey spaces on Heisenberg groups as

follows.

Deﬁnition 2. Let ϕ(g, r) be a positive measurable function on Hn × (0, ∞) and
1 ≤ p < ∞. We denote by Mp,ϕ ≡ Mp,ϕ(Hn) the generalized Morrey space, the
space of all functions f ∈ Lloc

p (Hn) with ﬁnite quasinorm

kf kMp,ϕ = sup

g∈Hn,r>0

ϕ(g, r)−1 |B(g, r)|− 1

p kf kLp(B(g,r)).

Also by W Mp,ϕ ≡ W Mp,ϕ(Hn) we denote the weak generalized Morrey space of all
functions f ∈ W Lloc

p (Hn) for which

kf kW Mp,ϕ = sup

g∈Hn,r>0

ϕ(g, r)−1 |B(g, r)|− 1

p kf kW Lp(B(g,r)) < ∞.

According to this deﬁnition, we recover the Morrey space Mp,λ and weak Morrey

In [13, 14, 30, 31] there have been obtained suﬃcient conditions on weights ϕ1
and ϕ2 for the boundedness of the maximal operator M and the singular integral
operators T from Mp,ϕ1 (Hn) to Mp,ϕ2 (Hn). In [30, 31] the following condition has
been imposed on ϕ(g, r):

(2.1)

c−1ϕ(g, r) ≤ ϕ(g, τ ) ≤ c ϕ(g, r),

the condition:

and g ∈ Hn.

In [31] the following statement has been proved.

Theorem 3. Let 1 ≤ p < ∞, 0 < α < Q
Q and the pair ϕ(g, r)
satisﬁes conditions (2.1) and (2.3). Then the operators Mα and T α are bounded
from Mp,ϕ (Hn) to Mq,ϕ (Hn) for p > 1 and from M1,ϕ (Hn) to W Mq,ϕ (Hn) and
for p = 1.

and for p = 1.

In this paper we establish the Spanne type boundedness of sublinear operators
Tα, α ∈ (0, Q) satisfying condition (1.1) generated by fractional integrals and prove
the Adams type boundedness theorems for these operators and also give BM O
(bounded mean oscillation space) estimates for their commutators in generalized
Morrey spaces Mp,ϕ (Hn) on Heisenberg groups Hn. The boundedness conditions
are formulated in terms of Zygmund type integral inequalities. Based on the prop-
erties of the fundamental solution of the sub-Laplacian on Heisenberg groups, we
prove the the boundedness of some Schr¨odinger type operators and their commu-
tators in generalized Morrey spaces.

In this section we give the Spanne type and the Adams type boundedness results

for the operator Tα, respectively.

Lp(Hn) to Lq(Hn) (see, for example, [9]) it follows that:

kTαf1kLq(B) ≤ kTαf1kLq(Hn) ≤ C kf1kLp(Hn) = C kf kLp(2B) ,

where constant C > 0 is independent of f .

In this section we give the Spanne type and the Adams type boundedness results

for the operator Tb,α, respectively..

4.1. Spanne type result. Now to prove the Spanne type boundedness of the
sublinear commutator operator Tb,α, α ∈ (0, Q) satisfying condition (1.2) with b ∈

Let T be a linear operator. For a locally integrable function b on Hn, we deﬁne

the commutator [b, T ] by

[b, T ]f (x) = b(x) T f (x) − T (bf )(x)

for any suitable function f .

Let us recall the deﬁnation of the space of BM O(Hn) (see, for example, [9, 25,

37]).

Deﬁnition 3. Suppose that b ∈ Lloc

BM O(Hn) = {b ∈ Lloc

1 (Hn) : kbk∗ < ∞}.

If one regards two functions whose diﬀerence is a constant as one, then the space

BM O(Hn) is a Banach space with respect to norm k · k∗.

Remark 3. (1) The John-Nirenberg inequality : there are constants C1, C2 > 0,
such that for all b ∈ BM O(Hn) and β > 0

|{g ∈ B : |b(g) − bB| > β}| ≤ C1|B|e−C2β/kbk∗ , ∀B ⊂ Hn.

(2) The John-Nirenberg inequality implies that

where C is independent of b, g, r and τ .

follows that:

5. The generalized Morrey estimates for the Schr¨odinger type

operators V γ (−∆Hn + V )−β and V γ∇Hn (−∆Hn + V )−β

In this section we consider the Schr¨odinger operator −∆Hn +V on Hn, where the
nonnegative potential V belongs to the reverse H¨older class B∞ (Hn). The general-
ized Morrey Mp,ϕ1 (Hn) → Mq,ϕ2 (Hn) estimates for the operators V γ (−∆Hn + V )−β
and V γ∇Hn (−∆Hn + V )−β are obtained.

The investigation of Schr¨odinger operators on the Euclidean space Rn with non-
negative potentials which belong to the reverse H¨older class has attracted attention
of a number of authors (see [7, 35, ?]). Shen [35] has studied the Schr¨odinger oper-
ator −∆ + V , assuming the nonnegative potential V belongs to the reverse H¨older
class Bq (Rn) for q ≥ n
2 and he has proved the Lp boundedness of the operators
(−∆ + V )iγ, ∇2 (−∆ + V )−1, ∇ (−∆ + V )− 1
2 and ∇ (−∆ + V )−1. Kurato and
Sugano have generalized Shen’s results to uniformly elliptic operators in [21]. Sug-
ano [38] also have extended some results of Shen to the operator V γ (−∆ + V )−β,
0 ≤ γ ≤ β ≤ 1 and V γ∇ (−∆ + V )−β, 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1
2 . Later,
Li [23] and Lu [24] have investigated the Schr¨odinger operators in a more general
setting.

2 ≤ β ≤ 1 and β − γ ≥ 1

The main purpose of this section is investigate the generalized Morrey Mp,ϕ1(Hn) →

Mq,ϕ2 (Hn) boundedness of the operators

eT1 = V γ (−∆Hn + V )−β , 0 ≤ γ ≤ β ≤ 1,
eT2 = V γ∇Hn (−∆Hn + V )−β , 0 ≤ γ ≤

Note that the operators V γ (−∆Hn + V )−1 and V

≤ β ≤ 1, β − γ ≥

1
2

.

2 ∇Hn (−∆Hn + V )−1 in [23]

are the special case of eT1, eT2, respectively.
It is worth pointing out that we need to establish pointwise estimates for eT1,
eT2 and their adjoint operators by using the estimates of fundamental solution for

the Schr¨odinger operator on Hn in [23]. And we prove the generalized Morrey
estimates by using Mp,ϕ1 (Hn) → Mq,ϕ2(Hn) boundedness of the fractional maximal
operators.

Let V ≥ 0. We say V ∈ B∞ (Hn), if there exists a constant C > 0 such that

kV kL∞(B) ≤

holds for every ball B in Hn (see [23]).
