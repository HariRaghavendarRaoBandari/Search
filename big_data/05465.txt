New results and improvements in the study of nonparametric exponential and mixture mod-
els are proposed. In particular, diﬀerent equivalent characterizations of maximal exponential
models, in terms of open exponential arcs and Orlicz spaces, are given. Our theoretical results
are supported by several examples and counterexamples and provide an answer to some open
questions in the literature.

model; Orlicz space

1. Introduction

The geometry of statistical models, called Information Geometry, started with a paper
of Radhakrishna Rao [10] and has been described in its modern formulation by Amari
[1, 2] and Amari and Nagaoka [3]. Until the nineties, the theory was developed only in
the parametric case. The ﬁrst rigorous inﬁnite dimensional extension has been formu-
lated by Pistone and Sempi [9]. In this work, the set of (strictly) positive densities has
been endowed with a structure of exponential Banach manifold, using the Orlicz space
associated to an exponentially growing Young function. The geometry of nonparamet-
ric exponential models and its analytical properties in the topology of the exponential
Orlicz space has been also studied in subsequent works, for example, by Gibilisco and
Pistone [5], Pistone and Rogantin [8], Cena and Pistone [4].

In this paper, we develop some ideas contained in Cena and Pistone [4] and we add
several new results and improvements in the study of nonparametric exponential and
mixture models. In particular, a novelty is represented by the introduction in this context
of the time dependence, which could allow to change the perspective from static to
dynamic.

In the exponential framework, the starting point is the notion of maximal exponential
model centered at a given positive density p, introduced by Pistone and Sempi [9]. One

of the main results of Cena and Pistone [4] states that any density belonging to the
maximal exponential model centered at p is connected by an open exponential arc to
p and vice versa (by “open,” we essentially mean that the two densities are not the
extremal points of the arc). In this work, we give a proof of this result, which is at the
same time simpler and more rigorous than the one in Cena and Pistone [4]. Moreover, we
additionally prove that the equality of the maximal exponential models centered at two
(connected) densities p and q is equivalent to the equality of the Orlicz spaces referred to
the same densities. Our achievements highlight the role of the Orlicz spaces in the theory
of nonparametric exponential models and its connection with the divergence between
densities, and thus, with Information Theory. Our theoretical results are supported by
several examples and counterexamples, which provide an answer to some open questions,
ﬁlling some gaps in the literature.

A second part of the work is devoted to the study of open mixture arcs and contains
results which are the counterpart of those obtained for open exponential arcs. More
speciﬁcally, we give the characterization of open mixture models by establishing the
equivalence between the open mixture connection and the boundedness of the densities
ratios q

p and p
q .

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, some basic notions in the theory of
Orlicz spaces are brieﬂy recalled. The deﬁnitions of open mixture and exponential arcs
are given in Section 3. Section 4 contains our main results. More speciﬁcally, the char-
acterizations of exponential and mixture models are dealt with in Section 4.1. Densities
time evolution and some geometric properties of exponential and mixture models, namely
the convexity and the L1 closure, are studied, respectively, in Sections 4.2 and 4.3.

2. Preliminaries on Orlicz spaces

In this section, we recall some known results from the theory of Orlicz spaces, which will
be useful in the sequel. For further details on Orlicz spaces, the reader is referred to Rao
and Ren [11, 12].

Let (X , F , µ) be a ﬁxed measure space. Young functions can be seen as generalizations
of the functions f (x) = |x|a
a , with a > 1, and consequently, Orlicz spaces are generaliza-
tions of the Lebesgue spaces La(µ). Now, we give the deﬁnition of Young function and
of the related Orlicz space.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A Young function Φ is an even, convex function Φ : R → [0, +∞] such
that

(i) Φ(0) = 0,
(ii) limx→∞ Φ(x) = +∞,
(iii) Φ(x) < +∞ in a neighborhood of 0.

The conjugate function Ψ of Φ, is deﬁned as Ψ(y) = supx∈R{xy − Φ(x)}, ∀y ∈ R and
it is itself a Young function. From the deﬁnition of Ψ, the Fenchel–Young inequality

immediately follows:

|xy| ≤ Φ(x) + Ψ(y),

x, y ∈ R.

This inequality is a generalization of the classical Young inequality |xy| ≤ |x|a

with a, b > 0, 1

(1)
a + |y|b

b

a + 1

b = 1, used in the ordinary La(µ) spaces.

Now, let L0 denote the set of all measurable functions u : X → R deﬁned on (X , F , µ).

Deﬁnition 2.2. The Orlicz space LΦ(µ) associated to the Young function Φ is deﬁned
as

LΦ(µ) =(cid:26)u ∈ L0: ∃α > 0 s.t. ZX

Φ(αu) dµ < +∞(cid:27).

(2)

The Orlicz space LΦ(µ) is a vector space. Moreover, one can show that it is a Banach

space when endowed with the Luxembourg norm

kukΦ,µ = inf(cid:26)k > 0: ZX

Φ(cid:18) u

k(cid:19) dµ ≤ 1(cid:27).

(3)

Consider the Orlicz space LΦ(µ) with the Luxembourg norm k · kΦ,µ and denote by

B(0, 1) the open unit ball and by B(0, 1) the closed one. Let us observe that

u ∈ B(0, 1) ⇐⇒ ∃α > 1 s.t. ZX
u ∈ B(0, 1) ⇐⇒ ZX

Φ(u) dµ ≤ 1.

Φ(αu) dµ ≤ 1,

Moreover, the Luxembourg norm is equivalent to the Orlicz norm

NΦ,µ(u) =

v∈LΨ(µ): RX Ψ(v) dµ≤1(cid:26)ZX

sup

|uv| dµ(cid:27),

(4)

where Ψ is the conjugate function of Φ.

It is worth to recall that the same Orlicz space can be related to diﬀerent equivalent

Young functions.

Deﬁnition 2.3. Two Young functions Φ and Φ′ are said to be equivalent if there exists
x0 > 0, and two positive constants c1 < c2 such that, ∀x ≥ x0,

Φ(c1x) ≤ Φ′(x) ≤ Φ(c2x).

In such a case the Orlicz spaces LΦ(µ) and LΦ′

(µ) are equal as sets and have equivalent

norms as Banach spaces.

From now on, we consider a probability space (X , F , µ) and we denote with P the set
of all densities which are positive µ-a.s. Moreover, we use Ep to denote the integral with
respect to p dµ, for each ﬁxed p ∈ P.

4

In the sequel, we use the Young function Φ1(x) = cosh(x) − 1, which is equivalent to

the more commonly used Φ2(x) = e|x| − |x| − 1.

We recall that the conjugate function of Φ1(x) is Ψ1(y) =R y

turn, is equivalent to Ψ2(y) = (1 + |y|) log(1 + |y|) − |y|.

0 sinh−1(t) dt, which, in its

Finally, in order to stress that we are working with densities p ∈ P, we will denote with
LΦ1(p) the Orlicz space associated to Φ1, deﬁned with respect to the measure induced
by p, that is,

LΦ1(p) = {u ∈ L0: ∃α > 0 s.t. Ep(Φ1(αu)) < +∞}.

(5)

It is worth to note that, in order to prove that a random variable u belongs to LΦ1 (p), it
is suﬃcient to check that Ep(eαu) < +∞, with α belonging to an open interval containing
0.

3. Mixture and exponential arcs

In this section, we recall the deﬁnitions of mixture and exponential arcs, and some related
results.

Deﬁnition 3.1. Two densities p, q ∈ P are connected by an open mixture arc if there
exists an open interval I ⊃ [0, 1] such that p(θ) = (1 − θ)p + θq belongs to P , for every
θ ∈ I.

Deﬁnition 3.2. Two densities p, q ∈ P are connected by an open exponential arc if there
exists an open interval I ⊃ [0, 1] such that p(θ) ∝ p(1−θ)qθ belongs to P , for every θ ∈ I.

In the following proposition, we give an equivalent deﬁnition of exponential connection

by arcs.

Proposition 3.3. p, q ∈ P are connected by an open exponential arc iﬀ there exist an
open interval I ⊃ [0, 1] and a random variable u ∈ LΦ1 (p), such that p(θ) ∝ eθup belongs
to P , for every θ ∈ I and p(0) = p, p(1) = q.

Proof. Let us assume that p, q ∈ P are connected by an open exponential arc, that is,

RX p(1−θ)qθ dµ < +∞, for any θ ∈ I. Since
p(1−θ)qθ dµ = Ep(cid:18)(cid:18) q

,

then u ∈ LΦ1 (p). Moreover p(θ) ∝ eθup belongs to P, for every θ ∈ I and p(0) = p, p(1) = q.

The converse follows immediately, observing that q = p(1) ∝ eup, that is, u = log q

c.

The connections by open mixture arcs and by open exponential arcs are equivalence

relations (see Cena and Pistone [4] for the proofs).

In the following, we recall the deﬁnition of the cumulant generating functional and its
properties, in order to introduce the notion of maximal exponential model. In the next
section, the maximal exponential model at p is proved to coincide with the set of all
densities q ∈ P which are connected to p by an open exponential arc.

Let us denote

LΦ1
0 (p) = {u ∈ LΦ1 (p): Ep(u) = 0}.

Deﬁnition 3.4. The cumulant generating functional is the map

Kp : LΦ1

0 (p) −→ [0, +∞],

u 7−→ log Ep(eu).

(6)

Theorem 3.5. The cumulant generating functional Kp satisﬁes the following proper-
ties:

(i) Kp(0) = 0; for each u 6= 0, Kp(u) > 0.
(ii) Kp is convex and lower semicontinuous, moreover its proper domain

dom Kp = {u ∈ LΦ1

0 (p): Kp(u) < +∞}

is a convex set which contains the open unit ball of LΦ1
dom Kp is a nonempty convex set.

For the proof, one can see Pistone and Sempi [9].

Deﬁnition 3.6. For every density p ∈ P , the maximal exponential model at p is

E(p) = {q = eu−Kp(u)p: u ∈

dom Kp} ⊆ P.

Remark 3.7. We have deﬁned Kp on the set LΦ1
guarantee the uniqueness of the representation of q ∈ E(p).

4. Main results on mixture and exponential models

4.1. Characterizations

In the sequel, we use the notation D(qkp) to indicate the Kullback–Leibler divergence of
q · µ with respect to p · µ and we simply refer to it as the divergence of q from p.

We ﬁrst state two results related to Orlicz spaces, which will be used in the sequel.

Their proofs can be found in Cena and Pistone [4].

Proposition 4.1. Let p and q belong to P and let Φ be a Young function.

The Orlicz spaces LΦ(p) and LΦ(q) coincide if and only if their norms are equivalent.

6

M. Santacroce, P. Siri and B. Trivellato

Lemma 4.2. Let p, q ∈ P , then D(qkp) < +∞ ⇐⇒ q

p ∈ LΨ1(p) ⇐⇒ log q

p ∈ L1(q).

From Lemma 4.2, we can prove the following result.

Theorem 4.3. Let p, q ∈ P . If D(qkp) < +∞ then LΦ1(p) ⊆ L1(q).

Proof. Let us consider u ∈ LΦ1(p), i.e. Ep(Φ1(αu)) < +∞ for some α > 0.

Note that, by Lemma 4.2, the hypothesis D(qkp) < +∞ is equivalent to q

p ∈ LΨ1 (p),

i.e. Ep(Ψ1(β q

p )) < +∞ for some β > 0.

Thus, using the Fenchel–Young inequality (1) and taking the expectation, we deduce

that

Remark 4.4. In Theorem 4.3, Ep(Ψ1(β q

< +∞. In fact, Ψ1 is equivalent to Ψ2 and it is easy to check that Ψ2 satisﬁes the
generalized ∆2 condition

Figures 1 and 2 show the geometry described in Theorem 4.3.
The next two results are technical preliminaries to Theorem 4.7. In particular, Propo-

sition 4.6 gives a suﬃcient condition on Orlicz norms in order to have log q

p ∈ L1(p).

Now, the conclusion immediately follows from Lemma 4.5, noting that its result holds
also when the strict inequality q
(cid:3)

p > M is replaced by q

p ≥ M .

The following theorem is an important improvement of Theorem 21 of Cena and Pi-
stone [4]. In particular, the main point is the equivalence between the equality of the
exponential models E(p) and E(q) and the equality of the Orlicz spaces LΦ1 (p) and
LΦ1(q). Moreover, we show that if a density belongs to the maximal exponential model
at p, there exists an open exponential arc connecting the two densities and vice versa.
This result was ﬁrst stated in Theorem 21 of Cena and Pistone [4]. However, the proof
is somehow involved and imprecise in some steps. Here, we give a simpler and rigorous
one.

Theorem 4.7. Let p, q ∈ P . The following statements are equivalent:

(i) q ∈ E(p);
(ii) q is connected to p by an open exponential arc;
(iii) E(p) = E(q);
(iv) LΦ1 (p) = LΦ1 (q);
(v) log q
(vi) q

p ∈ LΦ1 (p) ∩ LΦ1(q);

q ∈ L1+ε(q), for some ε > 0.

p ∈ L1+ε(p) and p

◦

Proof. We ﬁrst show the equivalence of the ﬁrst two statements. If q ∈ E(p), q ∝ eup for
some u ∈
dom Kp is an open convex set, we deduce
that p(θ) ∝ eθup is an open exponential arc containing p and q, for θ in an open interval
I ⊃ [0, 1].

dom Kp and

◦

◦

Vice versa, assume q is connected to p by an open exponential arc p(θ) ∝ eθup with
q = p(1). Since the exponential arc is deﬁned for θ in an open interval I ⊃ [0, 1], we can
always choose θu ∈ dom Kp, with θ > 1. We conclude that q ∈ E(p), by observing that u
is a convex combination of θu and 0 ∈

dom Kp, and thus, it belongs to

dom Kp.

◦

◦

Note that (iii) immediately implies (i). On the other hand, if we assume there exists
an open exponential arc connecting p and q, the equality of the exponential models (iii)
follows from the fact that the connection through open exponential arcs is an equivalence
relation.

The equivalence of the previous statements with (v) is clearly proved in Theorem 21
of [4]. Let us show the equivalence with (iv). (ii) ⇒ (iv) is proved in Theorem 19 of Cena
and Pistone [4].

Conversely,

if we assume LΦ1(p) = LΦ1 (q), by Propositions 4.1 and 4.6,

p ∈
LΦ1(p) = LΦ1 (q). Denoting u = log q
p , one can observe that, for any θ ∈ (−ε, +ε) with
ε > 0, Ep(eθu) < +∞ and Eq(eθu) = Ep(e(1+θ)u) < +∞. Therefore, using also Jensen in-
equality, one concludes that there exists an open exponential arc connecting p and q.

log q

The equivalence between (v) and (vi) easily follows from the deﬁnition of Orlicz
(cid:3)

spaces.

The geometry of Theorem 4.7 is shown in Figure 3.

Corollary 4.8. If q ∈ E(p), then the divergences D(qkp) < +∞ and D(pkq) < +∞.

Proof. The thesis follows from (vi) of Theorem 4.7, taking into account that q
is a suﬃcient condition for D(qkp) < +∞.

p ∈ L1+ε(p)

The converse of this corollary does not hold. In the following, we provide a counterex-
ample, which at the same time, answers to an open question raised by Cena and Pistone
[4].

Counterexample 4.9. Let us denote by X = [0, 1], F = B([0, 1]) and µ the correspond-
ing Lebesgue measure. We consider the trivial density p(x) = 1 and

converges when n(1+ε)
n+1 < 1, that is when nε < 1. Then, for any choice of ε > 0, we can
ﬁnd inﬁnitely many n > 1
ε , such that the integral above does not converge and, as a
consequence, Eµ(q1+ε) = +∞. Therefore, by (vi) of Theorem 4.7, we deduce that q /∈ E(1).
On the other hand, it can be proved that both D(qkp) < +∞ and D(pkq) < +∞ and

this concludes the counterexample.

We prove the last statements in the Appendix.

p : u → u − Eq(u) from LΦ1

Remark 4.10. From a geometric point of view, equality LΦ1(p) = LΦ1(q) in Theorem 4.7
is important. On the one hand, it implies that the exponential transport mapping, or e-
transport, eUq
0 (q) is well deﬁned. On the other hand,
due to Proposition 22 of Cena and Pistone [4], it also implies that LΨ1(p) = q
p LΨ1(q). As
a consequence, the mixture transport mapping, or m-transport, mUq
0 (p)
to LΨ1
0 (q) is well-deﬁned. For details on the applications of nonparametric information
geometry to statistical physics, see Pistone [7].

The next theorem is the counterpart of Theorem 4.7 for open mixture arcs. One of
the equivalences is an improvement of Proposition 15 in Cena and Pistone [4]. In Cena
and Pistone [4], it is shown that densities connected by open mixture arcs have bounded
away from zero ratios. Here, we additionally show the converse implication, giving a
characterization of open mixture models. Moreover, one can see that the key role for
being connected by open mixture either exponential arcs is played by the ratios q
p and
p
q which have to be bounded or integrable in some sense.

Given p ∈ P, we denote by M(p) the set of all densities q ∈ P which are connected to

p by an open mixture arc.

Theorem 4.11. Let p, q ∈ P . The following statements are equivalent:

(i) q ∈ M(p);
(ii) M(p) = M(q);
(iii) q

q ∈ L∞.

p , p

Proof. The equivalence between (i) and (ii) follows since the relation of connection
through open mixture arcs is an equivalence relation.

Now we show that p, q ∈ P are connected by open mixture arcs if and only if

c1 <

q
p

< c2

with 0 < c1 < 1 < c2.

Assume p and q are connected by an open mixture arc that is p(λ) = λq + (1 − λ)p belongs
to P for all λ ∈ (−α, 1 + β) ⊃ [−ε, 1 + ε] with ε > 0. Since p(−ε) and p(1 + ε) ∈ P, it is
easy to see that

ε

1+ε < q

p < 1+ε
ε .

).

Proposition 4.12. Let p, q ∈ P . If p and q are connected by an open mixture arc, then
they are also connected by an open exponential arc.

Proof. The result immediately follows from Theorems 4.7 and 4.11.

(cid:3)

The converse implication does not hold, as the following counterexample shows.

Counterexample 4.13. Consider the family of beta densities p(β) ∝ xβ−1, x ∈ [0, 1],
with β ∈ (0, +∞).

It is easy to see that given two densities p = p(β1) and q = p(β2), β1 < β2, they are
connected by an open exponential arc but they are not connected by an open mixture
arc. In fact, on the one hand the open exponential arc p(θ) ∝ p1−θqθ ∝ x(1−θ)β1+θβ2−1 is
still in the family of beta densities for any θ ∈ (− β1

, +∞) ⊃ [0, 1].

β2−β1

On the other hand, by Theorem 4.11, it does not exist an open mixture arc connecting

p and q, since the ratio q

p ∝ xβ2−β1 is not bounded below by a positive constant.

Remark 4.14. In Proposition 15 of Cena and Pistone [4], by diﬀerent arguments, it
is shown that if p and q are connected by an open mixture arc, then the Orlicz spaces
LΦ(p) and LΦ(q) coincide for any Young function Φ. When Φ = Φ1 the result immediately
follows from Theorems 4.7 and 4.11.

4.2. Exponential models and densities time evolution

In this paragraph, we introduce the time perspective in the study of exponential models.
As far as we are aware, this is the ﬁrst attempt in this direction.

Let us consider a ﬁltration F = {Ft: t ∈ [0, T ]} on the probability space (X , F , µ) such

that F = FT . Let p ∈ P and denote by pt = Eµ(p|Ft).

The following proposition gives a condition for the exponential connection stability of
the restrictions pt over time. From a geometrical point of view, this result means that
divergence ﬁniteness is preserved.

Proposition 4.15. Let t1, t2 ∈ [0, T ], t1 ≤ t2. If pt2 ∈ E(pt1 ) then ps ∈ E(pt1 ), ∀t1 ≤ s <
t2.

Proof. Let t1 ≤ s < t2. From condition (vi) of Theorem 4.7, it is enough to prove
)1+ε) < +∞, starting from the hypothesis that
that Ept1

(( ps

)1+ε) < +∞ and Ept2

)1+ε) < +∞ and Eps (( pt1

)1+ε) < +∞.

(( pt1

Since x1+ε is a convex function, by Jensen inequality we get

Since t1 ≤ s we have Eµ(·|Fs) = Ept1
pt1 in (10), we deduce that

(·|Fs). Then, taking the expectation with respect to

Ept1(cid:18)(cid:18) ps

pt1(cid:19)1+ε(cid:19) ≤ Ept1(cid:18)Ept1

pt1(cid:19)1+ε(cid:19) < +∞.

p1+ε

Since also x−(1+ε) is a convex function, the other condition follows in a similar way. (cid:3)

Remark 4.16. As a consequence of the previous proposition, it is straightforward to
observe that if ps0 /∈ E(pt1 ) for some s0 ≥ t1, then ps /∈ E(pt1 ) ∀s0 ≤ s ≤ T .

From the above proposition, we immediately get the following result.

Corollary 4.17. If p ∈ E(1) then ps ∈ E(1), ∀0 ≤ s < T .

As an application of this corollary, we can use the family of beta densities introduced
in the previous paragraph to give a concrete example of a density belonging to E(1),
along with its restrictions.

Example 4.18. Let us denote by X = [0, 1], F = B([0, 1]) and µ the corresponding
Lebesgue measure. Deﬁne the ﬁltration F = {Ft: t ∈ [0, T ]} on X , by choosing Ft =
σ([0, s]: 0 ≤ s ≤ t). Let p be any density on (X , F , µ). Then, due to the particular choice
of the ﬁltration, the restriction pt = Eµ(p|Ft) can be written as

pt(x) = p(x)1[0,t](x) +

1 − F (t)

1 − t

1(t,1](x),

(11)

where F (t) =R t

0 p(x) dx, ∀t ∈ [0, 1].

It is worth noting that p1 = p and p0 = 1 a.s.
Let us now ﬁx p(x) = βxβ−1, with β > 0. It is easy to ﬁnd an ε > 0 such that

Eµ(p1+ε) =Z 1
Eµ(p−ε) =Z 1

0

0

β1+εx(β−1)(1+ε) dx < +∞,

β−εx(β−1)(−ε) dx < +∞.

So, from (vi) of Theorem 4.7, we can conclude that p ∈ E(1).

With this choice of p, by (11),

pt(x) = βxβ−11[0,t](x) +

1 − tβ
1 − t

1(t,1](x)

∀t ∈ [0, 1],

and we can prove that pt ∈ E(1), in a similar way.

13

In general, the converse of Proposition 4.15 does not hold and below we give a coun-

terexample with t1 = 0 and t2 = 1
2 .

Using the same counterexample, we also deﬁne a density q ∈ E(1) (along with its

restrictions) such that, ∀t ≤ t0, pt = Eµ(q|Ft), for a ﬁxed t0 < 1
2 .

This density is quite similar to the one introduced in Counterexample 4.9 and, in the

same way we can prove that p /∈ E(1).

In order to see wether pt belongs to E(1) or not, we remark that the same convergence
problem arises whenever we integrate the function p1+ε over any interval containing 1
2 .
As a consequence, using the explicit formula (11) for the restriction pt, we can prove that
pt /∈ E(1), ∀t ≥ 1
2 , we can ﬁnd some ε > 0 (depending
on t), such that Eµ(p1+ε
t ) < +∞ is trivially
satisﬁed, so that pt ∈ E(1).
Finally, let us ﬁx t0 < 1

) < +∞. Moreover, the condition Eµ(p−ε

q(x) = p(x)1[0,t0](x) +

1 − F (t0)

1 − tβ
0

βxβ−11(t0,1](x),

with β > 0. This function diﬀers from the restriction pt0 only over (t0, 1], where pt0 is
constant, while q is proportional to a beta density.

Using the arguments above and those in Example 4.18 on beta densities, we conclude
that q ∈ E(1) (and qt ∈ E(1), ∀0 ≤ t < T ). On the other hand, by construction, pt =
Eµ(p|Ft) = Eµ(q|Ft), ∀t ≤ t0.

Remark 4.20. In a similar way, the density deﬁned in Counterexample 4.9 provides
also a counterexample of Corollary 4.17.

4.3. Convexity and L1(µ)-closure

Given p ∈ P, we denote by M(p) the set of all densities q ∈ P which are connected to
p by an open mixture arc. Moreover, let us recall that, by Theorem 4.7, E(p) coincides
with the set of all densities q ∈ P which are connected to p by an open exponential arc.

Proposition 4.21. Let p ∈ P . Then E(p) and M(p) are convex.

Proof. Note that for any q, r ∈ E(p), since E(q) = E(r) = E(p), it is not restrictive to
consider r = p. Suppose q ∈ E(p), and consider p(λ) = λp + (1 − λ)q for any λ ∈ [0, 1]. We
show that p(λ) ∈ E(p) by proving that Eµ(p(λ)θp1−θ) < +∞ for θ ∈ (−ε, 1 + ε).

If θ ∈ (0, 1), it follows by Jensen inequality

Eµ(p(λ)θp1−θ) = Ep(cid:18)(cid:18) p(λ)

p (cid:19)θ(cid:19) ≤ 1.

If θ ∈ (−ε, 0) ∪ (1, 1 + ε), by the convexity of xθ we have

Eµ(p(λ)θp1−θ) = Ep(cid:18)(cid:18) λp + (1 − λ)q

p

(cid:19)θ(cid:19) ≤ λ + (1 − λ)Ep(cid:18)(cid:18) q

p(cid:19)θ(cid:19) < +∞,

where the last inequality is due to q ∈ E(p).

On the other hand, one can easily see that M(p) is convex, since the relation between
open mixture arcs is an equivalence relation and, thus, q ∈ M(p) implies M(p) = M(q). (cid:3)

In the following theorem we prove that the open mixture model M(p) is L1(µ)-dense

in the set of all densities P≥.

Since from Proposition 4.12 M(p) ⊆ E(p), we deduce that E(p) is L1(µ)-dense in P≥.

This result was proved in Imparato and Trivellato [6], Theorem 19.1.

In the proof we use Scheﬀ´e’s theorem and, in particular, that if q, {qn}n≥1 are in P≥

and such that qn → q, as n → +∞, µ-a.e., then qn → q in L1(µ).

We remark that the L1(µ) convergence when restricted to the set of nonnegative den-

sities P≥, is equivalent to the convergence in µ-probability.

Theorem 4.22. For any p ∈ P the open mixture model M(p) is L1(µ)-dense in the
nonnegative densities P≥, that is M(p) = P≥, where the overline denotes the closure in
the L1(µ)-topology.

Proof. We show M(p) = P≥, by checking the double inclusions M(p) ⊆ P≥ and M(p) ⊇
P≥.

New results on mixture and exponential models

15

The ﬁrst is straightforward, since by deﬁnition M(p) ⊆ P and, therefore, M(p) ⊆ P =
P≥. With regard to the second implication, we will start by showing that any simple
density q ∈ P≥ is the µ-a.e. limit of a sequence of densities qn ∈ M(p).

Let us ﬁx a simple density q ∈ P≥ and denote Ω′ = Supp q = {ω: q(ω) > 0} and Ω′′ =

(Ω′)c = {ω: q(ω) = 0}. Moreover, deﬁne the sequence pn by

pn =

1
n

1(p<1/n) + p1(1/n≤p≤n) + n1(p>n),

and note that pn → p pointwise. For n ≥ 1, construct the sequence of densities in P

respectively, by two positive constants:

where an denotes a positive numerical sequence converging to 0 as n → +∞ and cn =
dµ + anP(Ω′′) the normalization constant. As q is a simple density whose support

is Ω′, there exist two positive constants a, A such that a ≤ q(ω) ≤ A if ω ∈ Ω′.

Note that qn ∈ M(p) by Theorem 4.11, since qn

p is bounded from below and above,

min(a/n, an)

cn

qn

max(An, an)

.

In order to check that qn → q, as n → +∞, µ-a.e., it is suﬃcient to prove that cn → 1.
In fact, since p
≤ max(1, p) and the function q max(1, p)1Ω′ ∈ L1(µ), we can apply the
pn
dominated convergence theorem and ﬁnd

lim

n→+∞

cn =ZΩ′

lim

n→+∞

dµ =ZΩ′

q dµ = 1.

Thus, by Scheﬀ´e’s theorem the sequence qn → q in L1(µ).

Since any density P≥ can be written as the limit of simple densities in L1(µ), we have
(cid:3)

proved that M(p) ⊇ P≥. This concludes the proof of the theorem.

The next corollary shows that the positive densities with ﬁnite Kullback–Leibler di-
vergence with respect to any p ∈ P is L1(µ)-dense in the set of all densities P≥. This
corresponds to the choice ϕ(x) = x(log(x))+ in the following result.

Corollary 4.23. Assume ϕ : (0, +∞) → (0, +∞) is a continuous function. Then the set

Pϕ =(cid:26)q ∈ P: Ep(cid:18)ϕ(cid:18) q

p(cid:19)(cid:19) < +∞(cid:27)

is L1(µ)-dense in P≥.

16

M. Santacroce, P. Siri and B. Trivellato

Proof. Let q ∈ P≥. The result immediately follows from Theorem 4.22, since the se-
quence qn ∈ M(p) converging to q in L1(µ) is in Pϕ, that is it satisﬁes Ep(ϕ( qn
p )) < +∞. (cid:3)
