Abstract

The ﬁrst-principle prediction of nanocluster stable structure is often hampered by the exis-
tence of many isomer conﬁgurations with energies close to the ground state. This fact attaches
additional importance to many-electron eﬀects going beyond density functional theory (DFT),
because their contributions may change a subtle energy order of competitive structures. To
analyze this problem, we consider, as an example, the energetics of silicon nanoclusters passi-
vated by hydrogen Si10H2n with 0 ≤ n ≤ 11, the structure of which varies with passivation from
compact to loose-packed, similar to branching polymers. Our calculations performed by the
DFT, hybrid functionals and Hartree-Fock (H-F) methods, as well as by the GW approximation
(GWA), conﬁrm a considerable sensitivity of structure prediction and isomer energy ordering
to many-electron eﬀects and show some results which may be obtained with the methods less
computationally demanding than the GWA.

1 Introduction

The unique properties of semiconductor nanoparticles are highly promising for many applications
such as optoelectronics, nanoelectronics, solar cells, biosensors, etc [1]-[5], so investigations on them
rank among the most burning topics. One of the challenging problems is the atomic structure
of nanoclusters and small nanoparticles, which generally diﬀers a lot from the structure of bulk
samples and varies widely with cluster size and composition. Nanoobject structure strongly aﬀects
its properties. There is a general understanding that variations in the atomic structure of nanoclusters
are conditioned by surface atoms, that contribute to cluster stability less than central atoms. The
minimum of the total energy triggers atom rearrangement being individual for each cluster. Because

the experimental determination of nanocluster structure is still problematic, so the reliable ﬁrst-
principles structure prediction is among the hottest problems of nanocluster physics.

First-principles methods based on density functional theory received general recognition as a
reasonably precise approach available for a wide class of materials. In particular, they are intensively
used in the study of nanoclusters and nanomaterials, including stable structure prediction [6]-[8]. A
relative simplicity of DFT equations and a reasonable accuracy of ground-state properties calculated
allow a detailed consideration of complicated nanoobjects and nanosystems. From a mathematical
point of view, the determination of cluster structure is reduced to a search for the atomic conﬁguration
realizing the global minimum of cluster energy. The search for the global minimum is especially
diﬃcult when a system has many local minima lying slightly above the global one. In this case any
inaccuracy or a small systematic error can distort a subtle energy order of atomic conﬁgurations. Of
course, there is a limit of accuracy, after which further improvements lose their meaning. For instance,
if the energies of isomer and ground-state conﬁgurations are very close Eisomer−Eground ≤ kBTeﬀ ∼ 0.03
eV - 0.04 eV (Teﬀ is the temperature of cluster synthesis or room temperature), both conﬁgurations
have comparable chances to exist and the choice of the ground state is conventional.

In ﬁrst-principles calculations, an evident source of systematic errors is the exchange-correlation
(xc) contribution to the total energy. This contribution varies signiﬁcantly depending on approx-
imation employed for its description from the standard LDA and GGA approximations [9],[10] to
the beyond-DFT methods. The important question of the ﬁrst-principles structure prediction is,
whether errors introduced by an approximated description of exchange and correlations shift the
energies of all competitive conﬁgurations by nearly the same quantity or the shift is individual for
each conﬁguration. In the former case, the prediction of stable cluster structure is not sensitive to
exchange-correlation approximations, while in the latter one a proper description of many-electron
eﬀects is of prime signiﬁcance.

To elucidate this question, we make the total energy calculations of silicon nanoclusters passivated
by hydrogen with formula Si10H2n (0 ≤ n ≤ 11) using diﬀerent xc approximations. According to our
early ﬁrst-principles studies [11],[12] the equilibrium structure of these clusters varies widely from
very compact (Si10) to loose-packed, similar to branching polymers built of SiH2 monomers (Si10H22)
(ﬁgure 1). Characteristic energy diﬀerences between atomic conﬁgurations also vary greatly with
the hydrogen passivation. As an example, in bare Si10 clusters the ﬁrst isomer energy lies at 0.6
eV above the ground state, while in Si10H22 clusters this quantity falls to 0.04 eV. This diversity of
structures and energetics renders the Si10H2n family very suitable to study the eﬀect of exchange-
correlation reﬁnements on cluster structure prediction. The calculations were performed for both
the ground-state and low-energy isomer conﬁgurations using the GGA, hybrid functionals, Hartree-
Fock and GW methods. In all, 31 cluster conﬁgurations corresponding to seven cluster compositions
were calculated, that gave valuable information about the impact of many-electron eﬀects on cluster

structure prediction. It could be mentioned, that hybrid functionals are often considered as a very
accurate approach for nanoclusters description, especially B3LYP (see the works[13]-[17]). On the
other hand these works give no reasons of the validity of such approaches.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 gives the basic formulas and discusses the physical
meaning of approximations relating to many-electron processes. Section 3 considers the details
of computation, while Section 4 checks the precision of our GW calculations using the simplest
molecules and clusters as examples. Section 5 presents the total energies of Si10H2n nanoclusters in
their ground-state and isomer conﬁgurations. These energies were calculated by the GGA, hybrid
functional, Hartree-Fock and GW methods. The discussion of these results reveals the sensitivity of
structure prediction to reﬁnements in the description of electron exchange and correlations.

2 Theory

The total energy of an electron system is given by the DFT expression [9] as:

The ﬁrst term in the right part of (1) (in square brackets) is the kinetic energy (Ekin), where i
and fi are the eigenvalues of the Kohn-Sham equation and their occupation numbers. The following
terms are, respectively, the energy of interaction with external ﬁeld (Eext), the Hartree energy (EH),

3

and the exchange-correlation energy (Exc). The eﬀective potential of the Kohn-Sham equation is
Veﬀ(r) = Vext(r) + VH(r) + Vxc(r), where VH(r) = δEH/δρ(r) and Vxc(r) = δExc/δρ(r). The standard
density functional theory describes the functional Exc[ρ] in a local or semi-local manner. In the DFT
GGA:

EGGA

[ρ] =

drρ(r)xc(ρ(r),∇ρ(r))

whereas the DFT LDA has no dependence on density gradient. The functional (2) assumes that
the density of exchange-correlation energy xc(r) is a function of electron density ρ(r) and its gradient
at the same point r. This approximation is best for metals, as their screened Coulomb interaction is
short-range, that makes xc interaction rather local. In semiconductors and dielectrics the screened
Coulomb interaction decreases very slowly with distance, approximately as e2/(0|r − r(cid:48)|), where 0
is the static dielectric constant. For this reason the use of local and semi-local approximations (the
DFT LDA and GGA) is not well-justiﬁed for dielectric materials.

The Hartree-Fock approximation accounts for a long-range nature of Coulomb interaction exactly,
ignoring, however, its screening. This approximation provides the exact exchange energy in terms of
the density matrix ρ(r, r(cid:48)):

but assumes that the contribution of electron correlations to energy is zero. This inadequacy
is partially compensated by hybrid functionals, which take into account a long-range nature of in-
teraction between electrons and describe approximately contribution from their correlations. The
simplest hybrid functional which realizes this idea [18] is:

xc = αmixEHF + (1 − αmix)EGGA

(4)

This equation can be derived within the framework of the adiabatic connection formalism (see, for
review, [19] and references there in). Its main contributions may be treated as follows. The ﬁrst
term of (4) describes a long-range contribution to exchange energy arising from statically screened
Coulomb interaction between electrons with 0 = 1/αmix. The second term is a short-range exchange
contribution given in a semi-local manner, while the third term represents contribution from electron
correlations, which also is semi-local as is required by a short-range nature of correlations. The
hybrid functional (4) depends only on one free parameter αmix, which is 0.25 (the PBE0 [20],[21]
functional) or is taken around this value.
In most cases the precision of (4) exceeds that of the
LDA and GGA. More sophisticated hybrid functionals B3PW91, B3LYP, HSE [22]-[25] and others,
which are common in the practical use, have three and more parameters that gives them additional
ﬂexibility and higher accuracy in the description of exchange and correlation.

It is frequently assumed (see, as example, [26]) that the eigenfunctions of Dayson’s equation are
nearly identical to those of the Kohn-Sham equation, so Ai,i(cid:48)(E) ≈ Ai(E)δi,i(cid:48). Introducing the density

methods. One of them uses the Luttinger-Ward functional ELW
to the functional of DFT (1). This functional is variational, so Etot resulting from it is accurate
even when an imperfect Green function G is used. The correlation contribution to ELW
is given by
tot
the functional Φc[G], which is reduced in the GWA to the series of ring diagrams corresponding to
the random-phase approximation (RPA). The calculation of this series is not easy for real solids,
particularly for nanoclusters, which hampers the practical use of ELW

tot [G].

The other method employs the Galitskii-Migdal (GM) formula [29],[30] which gives the total
energy of electrons in terms of the electron quasiparticle spectrum. This formula is derived from the
equation of motion for electrons and therefore has no analogs in DFT which is merely a static theory.

The assumption that the Dyson and Kohn-Sham equations have nearly identical eigenfunctions
φi(r) ≈ ψi(r) leads to the equality of their energy contributions Ekin, Eext, and EH. By this means,
a higher precision of Etot in the GWA as compared to DFT is determined by the diﬀerence between

QP − < ψ|Vxc|ψ > +Σ(EDFT

The actual GW computation meets with two involved questions. The ﬁrst one is associated
with the level of the self-consistency in the solution of Dyson’s equation.
In this way G0W0 is
the simplest scheme. G0 is usually picked as the DFT, Hartree-Fock or hybrid functional Green
function, W0(r, r(cid:48), t) = W [G0] and Σ0(r, r(cid:48), t) = iG0(r, r(cid:48), t)W0(r, r(cid:48), t). Quasiparticle (QP) energies
goes from expression EQP = EDFT
QP ). The QP spectrum found at this step is
much more precise than Kohn-Sham’s one. In particular, the HOMO-LUMO gap of semiconductor
nanoobjects calculated in the G0W0 approximation is rather close to the experimental gap, while the
DFT gap is two-three times narrower [32],[33]. Elementary improvement can be obtained by geting
QP − < ψ|Vxc|ψ > +Σ(EQP) and making iterations of the substitutions
QP energies as EQP = EDFT
EQP to Σ for next step until convergence is achieved (self-consistency in the eigenvalues or ev-scGW).
Further improvement can be obtained as follows. As the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction
W(r, r(cid:48), E) is not sensitive to the variations of G, an iterative solution of Dyson’s equation is frequently
obtained with the SEO ΣG(r, r(cid:48), t) = iG(r, r(cid:48), t)W0(r, r(cid:48), t), where only the Green’s function is iterated
to the self-consistency at the ﬁxed W0 (the scGW0). Fully self-consisted scGW is obtained when
Dyson equation is iterated both by G and W. In principle full self-consistency eliminates errors of
the start point calculations and leads to the satisfaction of conservation laws for the total energy,
momentum and particles number.
In works [34, 35, 36] it was noticed that fully self-consisted
GW improves the G0W0 total energy and ionization potentials, signiﬁcantly improving the DFT and
hybrid functional results. However both approximations (G0W0 and GW0) greatly decrease the body
of computation and yet provide precise quasiparticle spectra. It has been observed that sometimes
the simpler G0W0 and GW0 schemes provide even better spectra than the fully self-consistent GW
calculation [37, 38, 39]. This fact is explained by partial cancelation between vertex correction
diagrams and the self-consistency eﬀects [40]. According to (10), exact quasiparticles spectra give
precise total energies. For this reason the present study uses invariably the G0W0 approximation,
while the GW0 is applied only for few simple nanoobjects.

The second involved question is connected with the satellite structure in A(E), which arises
from dynamical interaction between electrons due to plasmon exchange. These plasmon satellites
manifest themselves as the peaks of A(E) positioned at multiples of the plasmon energy below each
quasiparticle level Ei. An often-used method of satellite description is the cumulant expansion, in
which the Green function for an occupied state i is taken as Gi(t) = iexp{−iEit + Ci(t)}, where Ei
is the quasiparticle energy and Ci(t) is the cumulant. This approach precisely reproduces plasmon
satellites in the experimental spectra of electron photoemission [41],[42]. It is noticeable that the

6

gravity center of the spectral density (cid:82) dEA(E) E taken over occupied states remains invariant to

satellite formation [43]. This invariance implies an upward shift of quasiparticle energies, which
balances the formation of low-energy satellite structure. When G0W0 calculation is restricted to the
quasiparticle states (ignoring satellites), this upward shift gives an illusion of decreasing cohesion
[44].

To simply circumvent this diﬃculty, a model spectral function can be employed. The model
describes an electron at the level i, which interacts with a plasmon having the plasma energy Epl.
The spectral function of this model can be done analytically, in terms of Epl and the renormalization
factor Zi [26]. Following this research and assuming that the satellite series is inﬁnite, the total
energy correction to DFT can be given as:

(11)

Here Ei is the quasiparticle energy calculated by the G0W0, N is the total number of electrons
in a nanocluster, and lnZ = Σi fi · lnZi/N, where 0 < Zi ≤ 1. In the homogeneous electron gas two
values Epl and |lnZ| ≈ 1− Z have opposite trends: with the growth of ρ the plasma energy increases
2 , while |lnZ| decreases, approaching zero at ρ → ∞. Because electron density averaged over
as ρ 1
a cluster varies only slightly from one low-energy conﬁguration to other, we expect that the second
term of (11) (the satellite contribution) is nearly invariant to atom rearrangements and aﬀects very
weakly the structures competition. This point is examined closer in Sections 3 and 4.

It is also of interest to examine correlation between nanoclusters’ polarizabilities and energet-
ics. Dielectric properties of the system reﬂect its interaction with external and internal electric
ﬁeld, electron screening, and aﬀect system energy as well. According to the adiabatic connection
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem (ACFDT)[45, 46, 47] the correlation energy can be expressed as:

EC = −

dλ

T r{v[χλ(iω) − χ0(iω)]}

(12)

where λ is dimensionless coupling constant (λ=0 for the case of noninteraction electron system
and λ=1 corresponds to the real physical system), χ is the electron response function, v denotes
Coulomb interaction. It can be seen, that system correlation energy increases when χλ, being neg-
ative, increases its absolute value. In the GWA SEO (6), screened Coulomb W can be rewritten as
−1(q, ω)×v(q) , where −1(q, ω) is an inverse dielectric function, thus in GWA dielectric properties of
the electron system explicitly aﬀect computation results. According to these simple reasons it seems
reasonable to expect, that for nanocluster isomers with deﬁned chemical formula the structures with
greater |χλ(iω)| have, in general, higher total energy and thus they are energetically less favorable.
Although  and χ functions depend on frequency, the static polarizability can be roughly considered
as representing an approximate system dielectric response. Calculation of the static polarizability is

implemented in many DFT packages and is much less time consuming than calculations on the GWA
level. The consideration of the relationship between Si7 and Si10H2n isomers total energies and their
static polarizabilities will be examined in Sections 4 and 5.

3 Computational methods

Our density functional calculations were performed with the DFT GGA xc functional using the
Quantum Espresso (QE) [48] and VASP [49]-[52] codes. The QE calculations were made using PBE
pseudopotential and a plane wave basis set having the cutoﬀ energy of 50 Ry, while VASP’s ones
were done with the Projector Augmented Waves (PAW) basis set having the cutoﬀ energy of 500 eV
with appropriate pseudopotential [53, 54]. Computations were performed for the supercell geometry
with the vacuum layer of 13 Å between nanoobject replicas (section 4 argues this layer choice). The
atomic structure of considered molecules and nanoclusters was found by the QE calculation, in the
process of which the positions of atoms were relaxed until resulting atomic forces became less than
10−4 Ry/Å. In the case of silicon clusters a nontrivial determination of cluster geometry was made
with the evolutionary algorithm realized in the USPEX code [55, 56], as has been described in our
previous publications [11, 12]. Both the Hartree-Fock and hybrid functional (PBE0 and B3LYP)
calculations were performed using the QE code with the parameters described above.

For the GWA calculations two packages were used: BerkeleyGW [57]-[59] and VASP. In both
cases for all calculations the start point were DFT eigenfunctions and eigenvalues calculated in
VASP for the VASP GW0 and in QE for the case of BerkeleyGW G0W0 and ev-scGW calculations.
The VASP GW algorithm performs a direct inversion of the dielectric matrix on a frequency grid.
The BerkeleyGW package can employ both the direct inversion of the dielectric matrix and the
Generalized Plasmon Pole (GPP) model [32] (GPP accelerates calculations and reduces computer
memory demands). The nonuniform frequency grid for the direct inversion of the dielectric matrix in
the VASP computations consisted of 50 points and of 200 points for the BerkeleyGW, the dielectric
matrix was cut oﬀ at 300 eV. In the BerkeleyGW GPP dielectric matrix was cut oﬀ at 6 Ry in the
momentum space. When computing the self-energy operator of the GWA, we performed summation
over all occupied and 600 unoccupied electron states.

GW0 and ev-scGW require notable extra resources, therefore these schemes were applied only for
small nanoobjects – the Li2, N2, ethyl and dimethyl ether molecules. BerkeleyGW dielectric matrix
direct inversion computations were applied only for the study of the plasmon satellites in the ethyl
and dimethyl ether molecules and the Si7 clusters. The GW calculations of Si10H2n clusters were
performed with the BerkeleyGW G0W0 GPP approximation.

In this paper for the nanocluster isomers energy calculations using GM formula we will neglect
plasmonic modiﬁcations in the spectral function. A(ω) will be considered as a number of the quasi-

8

particle peaks. Our calculations show, that plasmon satellites carry about 15% of the valence spectral
function weight in case of Si7 isomers and about 10% in case of dimethyl ether molecule. Thus lnZ
in mentioned cases is about 0.15 and 0.1 respectively (formula 11). For the nanocluster isomers of a
given formula, Epl can be treated similar with high accuracy. In case of the Si7 nanoclusters, shift
of the satellites from QP peaks is the same for all isomers with a precision better than 2%. For the
Si10H2n isomers it means that plasmonic corrections to the relative energy should be less than 0.4 eV.
This estimation is very rough and precision of our calculations for the test cases will be examined in
the next section.

In our work we also perform an analysis of the polarizabilities of the studied silicon nanoclusters.
Polarizability values α were calculated using VASP and averaged over directions. Polarizabilities are
measured in the relative units, where the lowest polarizability among isomers with given formula is
deﬁned as 1. Since total energy of a system is a value determined up to a constant shift and we
were interested only in the relative energies of the nanoobjects under study, further discussion will
be concerned only with energy diﬀerences. All isomer energies will be counted from the ground state
structure.

The data in table 1 show that obtained GW energies tend to modify DFT values towards the
experimental ones, in case of Li2 and N2 dissociation this modiﬁcation is little excessive. GW energies
exhibit better agreement with experiment than DFT results, they are based on. Accurate calculations
of the given systems require large vacuum layer, leading to the dramatic increase of the computation
cost in case of the plane wave basis set. Thus the use of high parameters was restricted, especially to
VASP GW0. PBE0 and B3LYP show rather bad energy values for the systems studied (and the worst
results in case of H-F). For the Li2 and N2 dissociation PBE0 and B3LYP give signiﬁcantly inaccurate
values. In case of the ethyl- dimethyl ether molecules energy diﬀerence, PBE0 gives very good result,
while B3LYP error is noticeably bigger than DFT one. Thus hybrid functional in a few cases may
improve results comparing to DFT, but this seems rather occasional. Summarizing the results of
the table 1 we can say that the used GM GW methods give the values closest to experimental.
Comparison of the BerkeleyGW schemes shows that self-consistency in the eigenvalues improves
results, but G0W0 results are also better than DFT and hybrid functional ones

For the DFT nanocluster and molecular calculations, size of vacuum layer needed to converge is
usually referred to 7-10 angstroms (for the systems with zero electrical charge) [61],[62]. Speciﬁed
value of vacuum layer makes inﬂuence of the system’s copies from other supercells negligible. Because
of the dynamical nature of the xc interaction, GW should be sensitive to the induced dipole-dipole
interactions or dispersion interaction. This interaction could be signiﬁcant at distances of about 10
Å. Besides, in practical applications nanoclusters could be embedded in a matrix and form a periodic
structure, where period value would aﬀect system properties. It is of interest to study the dependence
of the system energetics convergence (in particular within GW approach) on the vacuum layer and
the supercell size.

In case of the 10,5 Å supercell and larger, the structure with the isomer number 1 has the lowest
energy for all numerical schemes. Situation dramatically changes for the 8,5 Å supercell case. DFT
energy sequence remains almost similar and the structure 1 is still the lowest isomer. But in the
GW schemes structure 2 becomes ground state isomer, with energy much lower than other isomers.
System polarizabilities analysis shows, that structure 2 in the 8,5 Å supercell acquires α much

11

less than other structures, that correlates with relative structure stability. Such behaviour can be
associated with the increase in the interaction of the clusters in neighboring supercells. In the case of
B3LYP for the 8,5 Å supercell, structure 2 is also low energy isomer close to the structure 1 (ground
state one). PBE0 scheme mainly represents DFT results. GPP G0W0 and frequency-dependent
scGW0 approaches show identical isomer energy ordering. For the supercells larger than 8,5 Å,
isomers’ polarizabilities have small diﬀerences and do not give noticeable contribution to the energy
ordering of clusters.

Table 2 shows that for the GW approach the increase in the supercell size leads not only to a
monotonous convergence of the relative energies of the isomers. It could be seen, that structures
number 2 and 3 alternately change places on the energy scale when the supercell changes from 8.5 to
10.5 Å, from 10.5 to 13.2 Å, from 13.2 to 18.5 Å. Only for the supercell 18.5 Å this alternation stops
and for 23.8 Å supercell it is possible to say that convergence is achieved. Such behavior indicates a
complex nature of the decrease in screened Coulomb interaction with distance in nanoclusters.

For the supercell more than 13.2 Å (about 9 Å of vacuum layer) supercell size change causes DFT
energies deviations less than 0.2% and less than 1% for the PBE0 and B3LYP. GW relative energies
show slower convergence, the convergence of energy at a level of accuracy within one percent requires
an increase in vacuum layer up to 15 Å. The results show that hybrid functionals vacuum layer to
convergence is half as much again DFT, GW requires vacuum layer that is twice as large as DFT.

Figures 2-5 demonstrate the relative position of energy levels for the Si10, Si10H6, Si10H12, Si10H16,

for the Si10, Si10H6, Si10H16, Si10H22 nanoclusters. Graphs 4 and 5 present DFT PBE, PBE0, B3LYP,
Hartree-Fock and G0W0 calculations for the Si10H12 and Si10H20 isomers. It could be seen, that in
most cases GW isomer energies change their relative ordering comparing to the DFT results. PBE0
energies mainly represent DFT ones. B3LYP and Hartree-Fock calculations exhibit some diﬀerences
from DFT but also give no results consistent to the GW (even on a qualitative level). We also made
PBE0 calculations with diﬀerent mixing constant αmix for the xc term (see formula 4). Computations
with αmix varied from 0 to 1 just reproduce the results close to PBE or H-F and give no conceptually

new results. For the Si10H6 and Si10H12 isomers (ﬁgures 2 and 4) GW ground state structures also
diﬀer from DFT and hybrid functionals. In most cases the energy spread of the isomers in GWA is
expanded comparing to DFT.

Figure 6 presents values of the polarizability α and total energy from DFT and Galitskii-Migdal
G0W0 calculations. Each part on ﬁgure 6 presents results for the isomers with given formula: Si10,
Si10H6, Si10H12, Si10H16, Si10H20 and Si10H22. As can be seen, Si10, Si10H6, Si10H12 and Si10H16 clusters
in GM GWA mainly have lower total energy (more stable) for the isomers with lower α. The DFT
calculations do not exhibit such apparent energy-polarizability correlation. One can note violation
of this rule for the Si10H6 isomers: for the GW energy-polarizability curve structure with α=1 (point
marked as 1) has energy of 0.3 eV higher than structure with α=1.012 (mark 2). Calculations of
the Si10H2n clusters’ dipole moments show, that the structure marked as 1 has dipole moment of 1.2
atomic units, the largest value of all other clusters examined. Other clusters have dipole moments
of 4-100 times less. Apparently such a large dipole moment aﬀects the energy of the structure 1,
decreasing its stability.

The situation for the energy-polarizability correlation changes with the increase in the hydratation
rate. For the Si10H20 and Si10H22 clusters there is no correlation between α and GM total energy
value. This behavior can be explained as follows: for the Si10H2n clusters with n < 9 an inner Si core
can be localized; increasing n we get clusters of loose structure with no inner part (see ﬁgure 1). In
case of Si10H20 and Si10H22 isomers the structure is branched, rather one-dimensional for each branch.
In the works [63, 64] it was pointed out, that in small clusters microscopic dielectric properties at a
few atomic distances away from the surface are almost identical to the bulk ones, whereas surface
is one of the main factors that signiﬁcantly change cluster polarizability. Thus Si10H2n clusters

branched structures do not exhibit such obvious dependency.

6 Conclusions

DFT, hybrid functionals, Hartree-Fock, Galitskii-Migdal GW approximations were applied for the
silicon-hydrogen nanoclusters’ total energy computations. Precision of the methods was tested for
the cases of Li2, N2 molecule dissociation and ethyl-dimethyl ether isomer energy diﬀerence. GM GW
gives the most precise results of all methods examined, introducing a correction for DFT method,
being, in turn, the starting point for the GW computation. GW energy calculations also demonstrate
signiﬁcantly higher sensitivity to the nanocluster environment, requiring vacuum layer to converge
two times more than DFT. Moreover a non-monotonic dependence of the isomers energy distribution
on supercell size was found.

Total energy calculations of the Si7 and Si10H2n isomers show, that correct account of the electron
correlation eﬀects is of great importance in the nanocluster systems with a big variety of structures
close in energy. GWA demonstrates a notable change in the isomers’ energy ordering and gives a
correction to the energy of the order of tenths of eV for the isomers studied, comparing to other meth-
ods applied. Such correction will be signiﬁcant for the energy ranking of the competitive structures
up to a temperature of about a thousand degrees of Kelvin. It was established that standard GGA
and hybrid functional methods may introduce noticeable errors into the total energy calculations for
the nanoclusters consisting of tens of atoms. It is especially important for ground state structures
prediction when isomers have energy diﬀerences of an order of tenths of eV or less.

It was found that, in general, the compact nanoclusters isomers with lower mean polarizability
are more stable. In the branched, loose-packed structures such correlation vanishes. This provides
enough reason to expect that the minimal polarizability principle can be valid criterion for isomer
stability when energy ranking large nanoclusters systems, diﬃcult for GW calculations.
