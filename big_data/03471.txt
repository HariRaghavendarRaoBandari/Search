Abstract

We introduce a discrete 4-dimensional module over the integers
that appears to have maximal symmetry. By adjoining the usual
Minkowski distance, we obtain a discrete 4-dimensional Minkowski
space. Forming universe histories in this space and employing the
standard causal order, the histories become causal sets. These causal
sets increase in size rapidly and describe an inﬂationary period for the
early universe. We next consider the symmetry group G for the mod-
ule. We show that G has order 24 and we construct its group table. In
a sense G is a discrete approximation to the Lorentz group. However,
we note that it contains no boosts and is essentially a rotation group.
Unitary representations of G are constructed. The energy-momentum
space dual to the discrete module is obtained and a quantum formal-
ism is derived. A discrete Fock space is introduced on this structure
and free quantum ﬁelds are considered. Finally, we take the ﬁrst step
in a study of interacting quantum ﬁelds.

Introduction

It is well-known that general relativity and quantum ﬁeld theory are both
plagued by singularities and inﬁnities. This is particularly serious for quan-
tum ﬁeld theory because small distances must be considered there. These
diﬃculties are usually circumvented by methods of inﬁnity cancellations and
re-normalizations but the methods are mathematically suspect. In general
relativity, it is usually just admitted that the theory breaks down and is no
longer applicable at small distance scales. The simplest and possibly only so-
lution to these problems has been known for almost a hundred years [1, 5, 6].
At that time, it was suggested by several researchers that the physical uni-
verse is discrete. They speculated that there exists an elementary length ℓ
and an elementary time t. The likely values of these are the Planck length
ℓ ≈ 10−33cm and the Planck time t ≈ 10−43sec. In this view, spacetime is
composed of discrete, tiny cells of Planck size. This idea was not completely
outrageous because it was already known that energies were composed of
packets which came in multiples of Planck’s constant h and electric charge
came in multiples of the electron charge e.
(The latter was later altered
when quarks were discovered with charges ±1/3 and ±2/3, but the idea is
still the same.) One problem is that, unlike energy and charge, this granular
structure of spacetime has not been experimentally observed. However, some
investigators believe that with ever more sensitive instruments, this discrete
framework will eventually be unveiled.

The main problem with discrete spacetime is that a substantial amount
of symmetry would be lost. In particular, we would lose Lorentz invariance.
Lorentz invariance is not only a pillar of theoretical physics, it has been
experimentally veriﬁed a myriad of times. But it is possible that Lorentz
invariance is only an approximation. There may be a smaller, more fun-
damental symmetry group that is indistinguishable from the Lorentz group
except at very small scales.

This article attempts to construct a reasonable discrete spacetime upon
which a discrete quantum gravity and quantum ﬁeld theory can be built. How
should one proceed with such a construction? Let’s start with 2-dimensional
space and add time later. We could naively begin with a square lattice

a, b ∈ Z.

structure. Basic cells that we call vertices would be placed at b0 = (0, 0),
be1 = (1, 0), be2 = (0, 1) and other vertices would have locations abe1 + bbe2,
In this case, we set Planck’s length ℓ = 1. Now b0 is indeed a
distance 1 from its four nearest neighbors ±be1,±be2. But the distance fromb0

symmetry group for this square lattice is the group of order 4 consisting of
the identity and the three rotations by radian angles π/2, π and 3π/2.

to neighborbe1 +be2 is √2 and this is not a measurable distance which would
have to be a positive integer. Also, be1 and be2 are distance √2 apart. The
we have the basic vertices atb0 = (0, 0),be = (1, 0), bf = (1/2,√3/2) and other
vertices have locations at abe + bbf , a, b ∈ Z. Nowb0 is a distance 1 from its six
nearest neighbors ±be,±bf ,be − bf ,bf −be. We also have the bonus thatbe and
bf as well asbe andbe − bf and others are distance 1 apart. Unfortunately, the
distances frombe to bf −be is √3 which is not elementary length measurable.

The triangular lattice has more symmetry than the square lattice because its
symmetry group has order 6 and consists of the rotations by angles nπ/3,
n = 0, 1, . . . , 5.

We noted that the distances between many lattice vertices in both cases
are not elementary length measurable because they are not integers. In the
ﬁrst case, the distance has the form

However, this is not really a problem because as usual in relativity theory,
we measure distance with the Minkowski metric which is in terms of the
Euclidean distance squared so instead we have

which, of course, are integers. Notice that these two cases are the only ones

with this property. Indeed, suppose thatbg andbh are unit vectors in R2 with
inner productDbg,bhE = cos θ, where 0 < θ ≤ π/2. Then for a, b ∈ Z we have

||abg + bbh||2

2 = a2 ||bg||2

2 + 2abDbg,bhE

2 + b2||bh||2

3

while in the second case

and

||abe1 + bbe2||2 = √a2 + b2
||abe + bbf||2 = √a2 + b2 + ab

2 = a2 + b2

2 = a2 + b2 + ab

||abe1 + bbe2||2
||abe + bbf||2

= a2 + b2 + 2ab cos θ

Notice that the only values of θ for which this is always an integer are

θ = π/3 or π/2.

A similar analysis holds for 3-dimensional space. In this case we have a
cubic or tetrahedral lattice. As in the 2-dimensional case, we shall see that
the latter has certain advantages. Moreover, these are the only two that have
measurable Minkowski distances.

In Section 2 we discuss discrete 3-dimensional space. We ﬁrst construct
the tetrahedral lattice S3 and its corresponding symmetry group G(S3). We
show that G(S3) has order 24 and we exhibit its group table, In Section 3 we
derive 2- and 3-dimensional unitary representations for G(S3).
Section 4 introduces a discrete 4-dimensional module S4 ⊆ R4 that has
maximal symmetry in the sense we previously discussed. Letting ||u||4 be the
usual Minkowski metric, the pair (S4,||·||4) becomes a discrete 4-dimensional
Minkowski space.
In a sense, its symmetry group G(S4) is a discrete ap-
proximation to the Lorentz group. However, we note that G(S4) contains no
boosts and is essentially a discrete rotation group. We next form universe
histories S t−, t = 1, 2, . . ., where t represents a discrete time. Employing the
standard causal order u < v if u0 < v0 and ||u − v||2
4 ≥ 0, S t− becomes a
causal set (causet) [2–4].
The causets S t− increase rapidly in size and describe an inﬂationary pe-
riod for the early universe. During this period, the universe is essentially
ﬂat and gravity does not present itself. Moreover, the causets have a special
property that we call weak covariance. This property states that all paths be-
tween two ﬁxed vertices have the same length. At the end of the inﬂationary
period, the system experiences a phase transition and enters the multiverse
period. During the multiverse period, the universe splits into parts, each
with their own geometry. The various geometries then determine curvatures
and gravity in the constituent universes. Moreover, the causets possess a
stronger property called covariance [2–4].

The structure presented in Section 4 entails a novel phenomenon that is
more fundamental than the constancy of the speed of light c in a vacuum.
The reason that c is the upper speed limit is that c is the only speed that
a particle can attain other than zero. The reason that we observe slower
speeds is that we are measuring average speeds and c is the instantaneous
speed of a particle.

In Section 5 the corresponding energy-momentum space bS4 is obtained

4

and a quantum formalism on bS4 is derived. A discrete Fock space is in-
troduced on bS4 and free quantum ﬁelds are studied. A ﬁrst step toward

interacting quantum ﬁelds is presented in Section 6 and it is mentioned that
this framework may result in a mathematically rigorous quantum ﬁeld theory.

2 Discrete Space

For contrast and comparison, we begin with a discrete space formed from a

(0, 0, 1) be the usual basic vertices and let S 3

We shall not write down the group table for G(S 3

c ) because we want to
proceed to the tetrahedral space lattice which we believe has certain advan-
tages. Let e, f, g be unit vectors in R3 that are distance 1 from each other.
That is,

||e|| = ||f|| = ||g|| = ||e − f|| = ||e − g|| = ||f − g|| = 1

An example of such vectors is

e = (1, 0, 0), f = (1/2,√3/2, 0), g = (1/2, 1/2√3,p2/3)

but the particular form is not needed now. The four vectors (0, e, f, g) are
distance 1 from each other and form the vertices of a tetrahedron with edge
length 1. Notice that

(2.1)

he, fi = he, gi = hf, gi = 1/2

6

so the angle between any two of e, f, g is π/3. As mentioned in Section 1, the
cubic and tetrahedral space lattices are the only regular lattices for which
the distance squared between any two vertices is an integer. The vertices of
this lattice is given by the set

S3 =(cid:8)u ∈ R3 : u = ne + pf + qg, n, p, q ∈ Z(cid:9)

As before S3 is a module over Z. One advantage of S3 over S 3
is that
each u ∈ S3 has 12 nearest neighbors a distance 1 away so we now have 12
directions along which a particle can propagate.

c

Lemma 2.1. (i) The vectors e, f, g are linearly independent and form a
basis for S3.
(i) There are 12 unit vectors in S3 and these are given by
e, f, g, e − f, e − g, f − g and their negatives.
Proof. (i) If ne + pf + qg = 0, taking inner products with e, f and g give

n + 1

2p + q = 0

2p + 1

2q = 1

2 n + p + 1

2q = 1

2 n + 1

Solving these equations simultaneously we have n = p = q = 0 so e, f, g
are linear independent. Since dim R3 = 3, {e, f, g} forms a basis for R3 and
hence a basis for S3. (ii) If u = ne + pf + qg, n, p, q ∈ Z, is a unit vector, we
have that
1 = ||u||2 = n2 + p2 + q2 + np + nq + pq = 1
Hence,

2(cid:2)(n + p)2 + (n + q)2 + (p + q)2(cid:3)

(n + p)2 + (n + q)2 + (p + q)2 = 2

(2.2)

The only way that (2.2) can hold is if two of the terms on the left side of (2.2)
are 1 and the other is 0. This is possible if and only if two of the numbers
n, p, q are 0 and the third is ±1 or if one of the numbers is 1, another is −1
and the third is 0. This gives the 12 possibilities listed above.

A triad is three unit vectors in S3 whose inner products are 1/2. There are
8 triads given by: {e, f, g}, {−e,−f,−g}, {e, e − f, e − g}, {−e, f − e, g − e},
{−g, e − g, f − g}.
{f, f − e, f − g}, {−f, e − f, g − f}, {g, g − e, g − f},
Each triad corresponds to three triples written in cyclic order. For example,
corresponding to triad {e, f, g} we have the triples (e, f, g), (f, g, e), (g, e, f ).
We call (e, f, g) the basic triple. A symmetry on S3 is a linear transforma-
tion T : S3 → S3 that takes triples to triples and has determinant 1. The

7

symmetries are determined by their action on the basic triple. For example
if T e = f , T f = f − e and T g = f − g, then T preserves all triples. For
instance,

T (−g) = g − f

T (e − g) = T e − T g = f − f + g = g
T (f − g) = T f − T g = f − e − f + g = g − e

Hence, T (−g, e − g, f − g) = (g − f, g, g − e).
Since there are 24 triples, we conclude that there are 24 symmetries. The
simplest are the identity I(e, f, g) = (e, f, g) and A(e, f, g) = (f, g, e). We
can write the symmetries relative to the basis {e, f, g} as follows:

We denote the group of symmetries {A, B, . . . , X} by G(S3) There are

c ) and G(S3) both have order 24, they are
diﬀerent groups and we believe that G(S3) is more interesting. The group
table for G(S3) is given by Table 1.
Some of the subgroups of G(S3) are: {I, A, B}, {I, C, D}, {I, E, F},
{I, G, H}, {I, W, J, X}, {I, A, B, U, V, Q}, {A, B, . . . , L}, {I, J}, {I, K}, {I, L},
{I, T}, {I, U}, {I, V }, {I, M}. We can check from Table 1 that M and N
generate G(S3). In fact, any two non-commuting elements from {M, N . . . , X}
are generators. As usual, a linear transformation Z : S3 → S3 is an isometry
if hZu, Zvi = hu, vi for all u, v ∈ S3. It is clear that an isometry with unit
determinant is a symmetry. Conversely, it is easy to check that M and N are
isometries and since M and N generate G(S3), it follows that every element
of G(S3) is an isometry. We conclude that our deﬁnition of a symmetry on
S3 coincides with our original deﬁnition of a symmetry.

3 Unitary Representations

This section constructs unitary representations for the group G(S3). The ma-
trix realizations that we gave for G(S3) were not necessarily unitary because
they were given relative to the nonorthogonal basis {e, f, g}. Since these ma-

trices are isometries, if we represent them in the standard basisbe1 = (1, 0, 0),
be2 = (0, 1, 1), be3 = (0, 0, 1), they will become unitary. Using the concrete

form (2.1) for e, f, g, the two bases are related by

fact, they are orthogonal matrices because they have real entries. Since M

11

and N generate G(S3), it again follows that U(Z) is unitary for all Z ∈ G(S3)
so U is a unitary representation. Since G(S3) and U [G(S3)] are isomorphic
groups, we can and frequently will identify them.
All the matrices in G(S3) have eigenvalues among the numbers ±1, ±i,
e±2πi/3 with possible multiplicities. Of course, their corresponding eigenvec-
tors are diﬀerent, in general. For example, A has eigenvalues 1, e2πi/3, e−2πi/3
with corresponding (unnormalized) eigenvectors (1, 1, 1), (e2πi/3, 1, e−2πi/3),
(e−2πi/3, 1, e2πi/3) relative to the {e, f, g} basis.
It is easy to check that
B, C, . . . , H have the same eigenvalues as A. A new pattern begins with
J which has eigenvalues 1,−1 (multiplicity 2) with corresponding eigenvec-
tors (1,−1,−1), (1,−1, 1), (1, 0, 0). The matrices K, L, M, Q have the same
eigenvalues as J. The matrix M has eigenvalues 1, i,−i and corresponding
eigenvectors (1, 0, 0), (1,−1,−i), (1,−1, i). The other matrices are similar
to those already computed.
We can apply this work to ﬁnd eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the uni-
tary matrices in U [G(S3)]. For example, we have found the eigenvalues
λ1, λ2, λ3 and corresponding eigenvectors u1, u2, u3 for A ∈ G(S3). Now
U(A) = U −1AU so the eigenvalues of U(A) are λj, j = 1, 2, 3 with corre-
sponding eigenvectors U −1uj, j = 1, 2, 3. In particular, the eigenvalues of
U(A) are 1, e2πi/3, e−2πi/3 with corresponding eigenvectors

It is useful to ﬁnd the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the unitary opera-
tors U [G(S3)]. This is because the self-adjoint generator of U(Z), Z ∈ G(S3),
which gives an angular momentum operator can then be derived. For example

if U(A) = eiA′ has generator A′, then the eigenvalues of A′ are 0,−2π/3, 2π/3
and the eigenvectors of A′ are the same as those for U(A).
We now construct a unitary representation of U [G(S3)] on the 2-dimensional
Hilbert space C2. The standard construction goes as follows [7, 8]. For

bA ∈ U [G(S3)], the corresponding unitary matrix on C2 is given by

b

and a, b ∈ C satisfy the following seven equations. In these equations, we
denote a vector u ∈ R3 by its Cartesian coordinates u = (u1, u2, u3).

Technically speaking, R is a projective representation of G(S3) on C2.

14

That is R(Y Z) = ±R(Y )R(Z) in general. However, this is not important
because quantum states are only determined within a scalar multiple of ab-
solute value one. Examples are GH = I but R(G)R(H) = −I and J 2 = I
and R(J)2 = −I.

4 Discrete Spacetime

We have previously considered the space lattice S3. We now adjoin time to
obtain a spacetime lattice. Let d, e, f, g ∈ R be unit vectors satisfying

hd, ei = hd, fi = hd, gi = 0

he, fi = he, gi = hf, gi = 1/2

and

Then

S4 = {td + ne + pf + qg : t, n, p, q ∈ Z}

is a 4-dimensional module over Z with basis {d, e, f, g}. Clearly, S3 is a
3-dimensional submodule of S4. We are mainly concerned with the subset
S +
4 ⊆ S4 of vectors with t ≥ 0. We frequently call these vectors vertices and
consider them to be tiny spacetime cells that may be occupied by a particle.
If u = td + ne + pf + qg, we write u = (t, n, p, q) and use the notation u0 = t,
u1 = n, u2 = p, u3 = q.

We deﬁne the usual norm ||·||3 on S3 by

||ne + pf + qg||2

3 = n2 + p2 + q2 + np + nq + pq

and the indeﬁnite norm ||·||4 on S4 by
||td + ne + pf + qg||2

4 = t2 − ||ne + pf + qg||2

3

We sometimes write ||u||4 = (u0)2 − ||u||2
3 where u = (u1, u2, u3) ∈ R3. Of
course, the spacetime distance between u, v ∈ S4 is ||u − v||4. For t ≥ 0, we
deﬁne

S t =(cid:8)u ∈ S +

4 ≥ 0(cid:9)
4 : u0 = t, ||u||2

with u < w < v, we say that v is a child of u and u is a parent of v and write
u ≺ v. If u ≺ v, we call the edge uv a link from u to v. A path from u to v
is a sequence w1 ≺ w2 ≺ · · · ≺ wn where w1 = u and w2 = v. We call n − 1
the length of this path. In general, there may not be a path from u to v.

Theorem 4.2. (i) There exists a path from u to v if and only if u < v.
(ii) u ≺ v if and only if v0 = u0 + 1 and ||v − u||4 = 0 or 1. (iii) If u < v,
then any two paths from u to v have length v0 − u0.
Proof. (i) If there exists a path from u to v, then u < v by transitivity.
Conversely, suppose u < v. If u ≺ v, the u, v form a path and we are ﬁnished.
If u 6≺ v, then there is a w ∈ C+
0 such that u < w < v. If u ≺ w ≺ v, then
u, w, v form a path. Otherwise, there is a w1 ∈ C+
0 such that u < w1 < w < v
or u < w < w1 < v. Since there are only a ﬁnite number of vertices between
u and v, this process must eventually end and we obtain a path from u to
v. (ii) In Lemma 2.1 we constructed the 12 unit vectors in S3. It will be
convenient to label them by e1 = e, e2 = f, e3 = g, e4 = e− f, e5 = e− g, e6 =
f − g, e7 = −e, e8 = −f, . . . , e12 = g− f We can construct C+

If v0 = u0 + 1 and ||v − u||4 = 0 or 1, then u < v. Suppose there is a w ∈ C+

Conversely, suppose u ≺ v. By our previous construction of C+

(iii) If u < v then u ∈ S t and v ∈ S t′ for t < t′. From (i) there is a path
from u to v and by the construction in (ii), it is clear that every path from
u to v has length t′ − t.

t

t′

Applying Theorem 4.2(iii), all paths from 0 to v have length v0. We then
say that the height of v is v0. We conclude that S t is precisely the set of
vertices with height t and call S t the t-th shell in S
for t ≤ t′. Also, notice
from the construction in Theorem 4.2(ii) that every u ∈ C+
0 has precisely 13
children. We do not know the number of parents a vertex has and it would
be interesting to ﬁnd out. This would be useful in ﬁnding the cardinalities
of S t and S
If a causet P has the property that whenever u, v ∈ P with u < v, then
any two paths from u to v have the same length, we call P weakly covariant.
For a general causet P the height h(v) of v ∈ P is the length of the longest
path terminating at v. We say that P is covariant if h(u) < h(v) implies
that u < v [2–4]. We have shown in previous works that a covariant causet
has a natural weak metric and notions of curvature and geodesics. We have
employed these concepts to develop a discrete quantum gravity [2–4].

which are also unknown.

Lemma 4.3. A covariant causet is weakly covariant.

Proof. Let P be a covariant causet and let v ∈ P with v > 0. Let w1 ≺ w2 ≺
· · · ≺ wn be a path from 0 to v. It follows from covariance that h(wj) = j so
that h(v) = h(wn) = n. We conclude that any path from 0 to v has length
n. Moreover, if u < v, then any path from u to v has length h(v)− h(u).

t

t

Applying Theorem 4.2(iii) we conclude that the causets S

, t > 2, are
weakly covariant and it is easy to check that they are not covariant so the
converse of Lemma 4.3 does not hold. However, S
for t up to some limit t1
(possibly about 300) describes an inﬂationary period in which the universe
histories are essentially ﬂat and gravity has not yet taken eﬀect. After time
t1 most of the spacetime cells have been formed and the system goes into a
multiverse period. During this period, there are myriads of possible universes
which are expanding much more slowly. The universes develop curvatures
which are the cause of gravity. In the multiverse period, the universe histories
become covariant and this is employed to describe curvature [3]. However,
the curvature is local and the universes are essentially ﬂat because most of
the spacetime cells have already been formed.

18

We assume that if a particle moves from u to v, u, v ∈ C+

0 with u < v,
then it traverses a path w1 ≺ w2 ≺ · · · ≺ wn, from u to v where w1 = u,
wn = v. The length of the path is n − 1 = v0 − u0. By Theorem 4.2(ii) the
time interval between wj and wj+1 is 1 unit and the space distance moved is
either 0 or 1 unit. This tells us that the instantaneous speed of a particle is
either 0 or 1. Thus, a particle that is not motionless can move at only one
speed. If we are indeed using Planck units, this speed is the speed of light
c in a vacuum. This fundamental principle is the reason that c is the speed
limit for physical signals. What about objects that we know move slower
than c? They appear to be moving slower that c because we are actually
measuring average speeds in our observations. If a particle propagates from
u to v, we deﬁne its average speed to be sa = ||v − u||3 /(v0 − u0). Of course,
0 ≤ sa ≤ 1 so c is still the speed limit for average speed. Notice that sa can
have various values. For example, if u = 0 and v = 3d + 3e, then sa = 1,
while if u = 0 and v = 3d + 2e − f then sa = 1/√3.
It is interesting to ﬁnd the possible average speeds. Of course, there
are only a ﬁnite number of possibilities for u, v ∈ S
with t ﬁxed. For
simplicity, suppose a particle propagates from 0 to v so that sa = ||v||3 /v0.
For v0 = 1, the only possibilities are sa = 0, 1. For v0 = 2, the possibilities
are sa = 0, 1/2,√2/2,√3/2, 1. For v0 = 3, we have

t

sa = 0, 1/3,√2/3,√3/3, . . . ,√8/√3, 1

But now the pattern ends and there are gaps. For v0 = 4 we have

sa = 0,√3/4,√4/4,√5/4, . . . ,√15/4, 1

For v0 = 5 we obtain

sa = 0, 1/5,√2/5, 2/5,√6/5,√7/5, 3/5,√12/5,√13/5, . . . ,√24/5, 1
We do not know a general formula for possible sa corresponding to v0.

A symmetry on S4 is a linear bijection T : S4 → S4 that preserves the
norm ||·||4 and has unit determinant. A symmetry T is a boost if T d 6= d.
Notice, if T d = d then TS3 = S3 because

0 = hd, ei = hT d, T ei = hd, T ei

so T e ∈ S3 and similarly, T f, T g ∈ S3. Symmetries that are not boosts have
the form 1 ⊕ Z, Z ∈ G(S3). The question that now presents itself is: Are

19

there any boosts? The simplest examples in classical special relativity are
the basic boosts of the form [7, 8]

The transformation T describes a coordinate system moving at the constant
velocity v along the x1 axis. But in our situation, we only have two values
for an instantaneous velocity, v = 0 or 1. In the ﬁrst case, T = I which is
not a boost, while the second case is impossible. Even if other values of v
are allowed (average velocities), it is easy to check that T does not leave S4
invariant.

Theorem 4.4. There are no boosts.

Proof. Suppose T : S4 → S4 is a boost and

T d = t0d + t1e + t2f + t3g
T e = s0d + s1e + s2f + s3g

Then

Hence,

The only combination of cases (4.3), (4.4) with cases (4.6), (4.7) that satisfy
(4.8) are (4.4) and (4.6). Thus,

T e = d + e + f − g

But the same reasoning shows that T f = d + e + f − g. Hence, T e = T f
which contradicts the bijectivity of T .

We conclude from Theorem 4.4 that all symmetries of S4 have the form

1 ⊕ Z, Z ∈ G(S3). We denote this group by G(S4).

5 Discrete Quantum Field Theory

As discussed in the previous section, S4 is the discrete spacetime background
for expanding universe histories during an inﬂationary period. Most of the
spacetime cells are formed and the universe is essentially ﬂat during this
period. Curvatures and gravity do not emerge until later. We now discuss
discrete quantum ﬁeld theory. As usual, this theory only employs special rel-
ativity and the general relativity of gravity is neglected. This assumption is
well-founded because gravitation is extremely weak compared to electromag-
netic and nuclear forces. For this reason we shall take S4 as the underlying
spacetime for our quantum ﬁeld theory.

Let bS4 be a copy of S4 whose elements are labeled by
in Cartesian coordinates. We think of bS4 as being dual to S4 with indeﬁnite

p = (p0, p) = (p0, p1, p2, p3)

inner product

p · x = p0x0 − p1x1 − p2x2 − p3x3

21

where x ∈ S4 is given in Cartesian coordinates. We call p0 the total energy,
p the momentum and
m2 = ||p||2

3 = (p0)2 − (p1)2 − (p2)2 − (p3)2

4 = (p0)2 − ||p||2

the mass squared. We only consider m2 when m2 ≥ 0. We see that m2 can
only have integer values so mass is discrete in this theory. We have not found
a formula for the possible values of m2 as a function of p0 and this would be
of interest to know. We have computed the values of ||p||2
3 up to 49 which
are the following:

||p||2

3 = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 13, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, . . . , 28, 31, 33, 35, . . . , 39, 43, 49

We then obtain the following mass squared values as a function of p0

p0 m2
0 0

1 0, 1

2 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

3 0, 1, 2, . . ., 9

4 0, 3, 4, . . ., 16

5 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, . . ., 25

6 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, . . ., 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24, . . ., 36

7 0, 6, 10, . . ., 14, 16, 18, 21, . . ., 26, 28, 30, 31, 33, 36, . . ., 49

We can identify G(S4) with G(bS4) and when we write Z ∈ G(S4) we mean
Z ∈ G(S4) or Z ∈ G(bS4) whichever is applicable. The set S4×G(S4) becomes

a group with product

(y, Y )(z, Z) = (y + Y z, Y Z)

We think of S4 × G(S4) as a discrete Poincare group. For m2 ≥ 0, the mass
hyperboloid is the set

The basic Hilbert space for this theory is

4 = m2o
Γm =np ∈ bS4 : ||p||2
Hm = L2(Γm) =(f : Γm → C : Xp∈Γm

|f (p)|2 < ∞)

with the usual inner product

hf, gi = Xp∈Γm

f (p)g(p)

Deﬁne the representation V of S4 × G(S4) on Hm by

[V (y, Y )f ] (p) = eip·yf (Y −1p)

To show that V gives a representation, we have

[V (y, Y )V (z, Z)f ] (p) = eip·y [V (z, Z)f ] (Y −1p)

= eip·yeiY −1p·zf (Z −1Y −1p)

= eip·(y+Y z)f(cid:0)(Y Z)−1p(cid:1)

= [V (y + Y z, Y Z)f ] (p)
= [V ((y, Y )(z, Z)) f ] (p)

where the third equality follows from

Y −1p · z = Y Y −1p · Y z = p · Y z
Notice that Z ∈ G(S4) leaves Γm invariant because

It follows that V is a unitary representation. Indeed,

4 = m2

4 = ||p||2

f (p)g(p) = hf, gi

We have the four self-adjoint operators P j, j = 0, 1, 2, 3, on Hm given by

(P jf )(p) = pjf (p). Since

(P 0)2f (p) = (p0)2f (p) =(cid:2)(p1)2 + (p2)2 + (p3)2 + m2(cid:3) f (p)

=(cid:2)(P 1)2 + (P 2)2 + (P 3)2 + m2(cid:3) f (p)

23

we conclude that

(P 0)2 = (P 1)2 + (P 2)2 + (P 3)2 + m2I

The eigenvectors of P 2 are the characteristic functions χp, p ∈ Γm with
eigenvalues pj, j = 0, 1, 2, 3, on the mass hyperboloid.
The space Hm that we have considered until now is the scalar (or spin-
0) mass m Hilbert space. The vector (or spin-1) mass m Hilbert space is
Hm ⊗ C3 with the usual inner product. The representation V1 of S4 × G(S4)
on Hm ⊗ C3 is given by

V1(y, Y )f (p) ⊗ v = eip·yf (Y −1p) ⊗ U(Y −1)v

As before, V1 is a unitary representation. The spin-1/2 mass m Hilbert space
is Hm ⊗ C2 with the usual inner product. The unitary representation V1/2 of
S4 × G(S4) on Hm ⊗ C2 is given by

V1/2(y, Y )f (p) ⊗ v = eip·yf (Y −1p) ⊗ R(Y −1)v
We can continue to form the spin-n/2 mass m Hilbert space

where there are n factors of C2 with the unitary representation

Hm ⊗ C2 ⊗ · · · ⊗ C2

Vn/2(y, Y )f (p) ⊗ v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vn = eip·yf (Y −1p) ⊗ R(Y −1)v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ R(Y −1)vn
We ﬁnally develop a discrete quantum ﬁeld theory. For simplicity, we
shall only consider scalar ﬁelds and the extension to nonzero spins is fairly
straightforward. We ﬁrst form the Hilbert space Hm = ⊕∞

We can consider f ∈ H n
m as a symmetric function of n variables f (p1, . . . , pn),
pj ∈ Γm, j = 1, 2, . . . , n. For x ∈ S4 we construct the ﬁeld operators
φ(x) : Hm → Hm by deﬁning φ(x) : H n+1

we have

where bpj means omit pj. We interpret φ(x) as an operator that annihilates

a mass m particle at the spacetime point x while ψ(x) is an operator that
creates a mass m particle at the spacetime point x. We obtain a unitary
representation of S4 × G(S4) on Hm by deﬁning

We conclude that

Hence, ψ(x) = φ(x)∗.

It is not hard to show that the commutator [φ(x), φ(y)] = 0 for all x, y ∈

S4. Similarly, [ψ(x), ψ(y)] = 0 for all x, y ∈ S4.
Theorem 5.2. For all x, y ∈ S4 we have that

[φ(x), ψ(y)] = Xp∈Γm

Proof. For f (n) ∈ H n

Therefore,

It follows that

for all f ∈ Hm

We also deﬁne the self-adjoint ﬁeld operators ξ(x) = φ(x) + ψ(x) for all

x ∈ S4.
Corollary 5.3. For all x, y ∈ S4 we have that

[ξ(x), ξ(y)] = 2i Xp∈Γm

sin p · (y − x)I

Proof. Since [φ(x), φ(y)] = [ψ(x), ψ(y)] = 0 we have that

[ξ(x), ξ(y)] x = [φ(x), ψ(y)] + [ψ(x), φ(y)]

Applying Theorem 5.2 gives

The quantum ﬁeld theory that we have developed is essentially trivial
because the ﬁelds are free with no interactions. We view this as just the
beginning, and initiate the diﬃcult task of investigating interacting ﬁelds
in the next section.
It is hoped that these initial steps may result in a
mathematically rigorous quantum ﬁeld theory without singularities.

Interacting Quantum Fields

This section provides a simple example of interacting quantum ﬁelds.
If
X(n), n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., are operators on a Hilbert space, we deﬁne the diﬀer-
ence operator ∇X by ∇X(n) = X(n + 1) − X(n). We begin with a simple,
but useful, lemma.

Lemma 6.1. If X(n) and A(n) are operators on the same Hilbert space,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., satisfying ∇X(n) = A(n)X(n), then
X(n) = [I + A(n − 1)] [I + A(n − 2)]· · · [I + A(0)] X(0)

n−1Xj=0

="I +
A(j) +X {A(j1)A(j2) : j1, j2 = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1, j2 < j1}
+X {A(j1)A(j2)A(j3) : j1, j2, j3 = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1, j3 < j2 < j1}
+ · · · + A(n − 1)A(n − 2) · · · A(1)A(0)(cid:21)X(0)

Proof. We have that X(n+1)−X(n) = A(n)X(n) so X(n+1) = [I + A(n)] X(n).
Replacing n + 1 by n we obtain

X(n) = [I + A(n − 1)] X(n − 1) = [I + A(n − 1)] [I + A(n − 2)] X(n − 2)

= · · · = [I + A(n − 1)] [I + A(n − 2)]· · · [I + A(0)] X(0)

The second equality follows by induction.

For x ∈ S4 deﬁne the ﬁeld operators π(x) = φ(x) + φ(x)∗ on the Hilbert
space Hm as discussed in Section 5. Also, let σ(x), x ∈ S4, be similarly
deﬁned ﬁeld operators on the Hilbert space HM , M ≥ 0. We think of π(x)
as describing π-particles of mass m and σ(x) as describing σ-particles of mass
M. The interaction between these two types of particles will be described on
the tensor product H = Hm⊗HM . Central roles are played by two operators
on H. These operators are functions of time x0 = 0, 1, 2, . . ., and are the self-
adjoint interaction Hamiltonian H(x0) and the scattering operator S(x0).
We assume that S(0) = I and that S(x0) satisﬁes the discrete Schr¨odinger’s
equation:

−i∇x0S(x0) = H(x0)S(x0)

28

(6.1)

It is interesting that (6.1) resembles the inclusion-exclusion principle which
is useful in probability and combinatorics theory. In the usual continuum
theory, (6.1) has the form of a very complicated integral involving time-
ordered products. In (6.1) the time-ordering is simpler and results in fewer
terms. Essentially the only experiments available in quantum ﬁeld theory
are scattering experiments and the main objective in quantum ﬁeld theory is
to calculate the ﬁnal scattering operator S = limn→∞ S(n). Unfortunately,
(6.1) cannot usually be solved in closed form to ﬁnd S. The only thing we
can do is use approximations or perturbative techniques. The interaction
Hamiltonian is usually given in terms of the Hamiltonian density K(x) by

H(x0) =X {K(x0, x1, x2, x3) : ||x||4 ≥ 0}

In our particular example, suppose we consider the scattering of two π-
particles interacting with a σ-particle. We take K(x) = gπ2(x) ⊗ σ(x) [8],
where g is the coupling constant. When g is small, not as many terms are
needed for approximations. Assume that the two π-particles initially have
energy-momenta p and q giving rise, after scattering, to two π-particles with
ﬁnal energy-momenta p′ and q′. Instead of writing the initial and ﬁnal states
as |pi ⊗ |qi, |p′i ⊗ |q′i we use the simpler notation |pqi and |p′q′i, respec-
tively. The probability amplitude for the event of interest is hp′q′|S|pqi and
the probability becomes

Applying (6.1), the ﬁrst two terms of hp′q′|S|pqi have the form

|hp′q′|S|pqi|2
hp′q′ | pqi + i X||x||4≥0

hp′q′|K(x)|pqi

Assuming that |pqi 6= |p′q′i, the two vectors are orthogonal so the ﬁrst term is
zero. The second term contains one K(x) and hence only one σ(x) ﬁeld. This

29

applied to |pqi gives 0 for the annihilation part or a state of the form |pq, ri
for the creation part. Since hp′q′ | pq, ri = 0 we again obtain 0. Similarly, any
term with an odd number of K(x) gives 0. The third term is nonzero and is
treated in a similar way. However, there are quite a few possibilities and it
appears that the best way to keep track is to employ Feynman diagrams [8].
We shall leave the details to later works.
