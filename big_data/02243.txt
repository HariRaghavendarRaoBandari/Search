We study the degree to which the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be used to constrain
primordial non-Gaussianity involving one tensor and two scalar ﬂuctuations, focusing on the corre-
lation of one B-mode polarization ﬂuctuation with two temperature ﬂuctuations. In the simplest
models of inﬂation, the tensor-scalar-scalar primordial bispectrum is non-vanishing and is of the
same order in slow-roll parameters as the scalar-scalar-scalar bispectrum. We calculate the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105)
correlation arising from a primordial tensor-scalar-scalar bispectrum, and show that constraints from
an experiment like CMB-Stage IV using this observable are more than an order of magnitude better
than those on the same primordial coupling obtained from temperature measurements alone. We
argue that B-mode non-Gaussianity opens up an as-yet-unexplored window into the early Universe,
demonstrating that signiﬁcant information on primordial physics remains to be harvested from CMB
anisotropies.

INTRODUCTION

Observations of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) and large-scale structure have in recent years
greatly advanced our understanding of the contents and
history of the Universe. Current observational data ﬁt
well with the concordance six-parameter ΛCDM model
[1]. While the excellent agreement between the model
and the data is undoubtedly a triumph of modern cos-
mology, our understanding of the Universe’s initial con-
ditions remains limited, and it is crucial to explore new
observational probes that can deepen our understanding
of the underlying physics.

Within the concordance model, the initial ﬂuctuations
are fully accounted for by primordial density ﬂuctuations,
which are purely Gaussian, adiabatic, and nearly scale
invariant, and can be described by just two parameters,
the amplitude As and the scalar spectral index ns. A
very wide class of early-universe models are capable of
accounting for such primordial ﬂuctuations, and there-
fore these two parameters alone are not greatly informa-
tive. A great deal of eﬀort has therefore been devoted
to searching for signatures of deviations from this simple
picture. Even in the absence of a detected deviation from
the concordance model, upper limits on various observ-
ables greatly help to discriminate among early-universe
models. Particularly interesting observables in this re-
gard include non-adiabaticity [2], running of the scalar
spectral index [3–6], primordial tensor ﬂuctuations [7–
10], and non-Gaussianity [11–13].

The CMB contains cosmological information both in
its temperature and linear polarization. The polariza-
tion ﬁeld can be separated into E-modes and B-modes
which have opposite intrinsic parity. Primordial scalar

ﬂuctuations source temperature ﬂuctuations and E-mode
polarization, while primordial tensors source T , E, and
B ﬂuctuations [7–10].

The CMB temperature power spectrum has recently
been measured to cosmic variance limits up to multi-
pole (cid:96) ≈ 2000 using data from the Planck satellite [2].
Due to the diﬀusion damping of ﬂuctuations on smaller
scales, we do not expect that lower-noise observations
of the CMB will provide signiﬁcantly more cosmologi-
cal information from temperature ﬂuctuations. There is
some additional information which can be gained from
lower-noise measurements of E-mode polarization of the
CMB, though temperature and E-mode ﬂuctuations are
sourced by nearly the same cosmological modes, and
therefore constraints on observables like non-Gaussianity
and the running of the spectral index will not signiﬁ-
cantly improve on the current status with CMB mea-
surements alone [16]. Alternatively, large-scale-structure
observations can provide additional cosmological infor-
mation which could eventually lead to a detection of non-
Gaussianity or running [13]. This will require, however,
overcoming signiﬁcant challenges in the modeling of non-
linearities [13, 17, 18], biasing [19, 20], and complex astro-
physical processes [21–25]. Another potential avenue for
measurements of primordial non-Gaussianities is the to-
mographic mapping of neutral hydrogen at high redshift
with the 21-cm line [26–28]. This will require overcom-
ing daunting observational challenges [29–31], as well as
a detailed modeling of the intrinsic non-linearities of 21-
cm ﬂuctuations [28]. Finally, spatial ﬂuctuations of CMB
spectral distortions can also be used to probe primordial
non-Gaussianities [32–34].

Until recently,

the best constraint on primordial
tensor ﬂuctuations was derived from the measure-
ment of the CMB temperature power spectrum [35,
36].Unfortunately, on large angular scales where the ten-
sor contribution to the temperature power spectrum is
most signiﬁcant, the scalar contribution to the temper-
ature power spectrum is much larger, and constraints
on tensor ﬂuctuations from temperature measurements
alone are hindered by the relatively large cosmic variance

of the temperature ﬂuctuations.

Ongoing and future observations of the CMB will dras-
tically improve the constraints on primordial tensor ﬂuc-
tuations by searching for B-mode polarization on large
angular scales. Several such experiments are currently
underway, with the most recent constraints coming from
the BICEP/Keck experiment [37]. The biggest astro-
physical obstacles in constraining the primordial signal
are the contributions from dust [38, 39] and lensing of E-
modes to B-modes [40]. For the former, we will have to
rely on multi-frequency information to separate the dust
component from the primordial signal. For the latter,
delensing will become crucial for removing lens-induced
ﬂuctuations and requires a high-ﬁdelity lensing map [41].
While the usual searches for non-Gaussianity focus on
the N -point statistics of scalar ﬂuctuations, in this pa-
per we will discuss the relatively unexplored observa-
tional signatures of non-Gaussian correlations involving
tensor ﬂuctuations. Since tensor ﬂuctuations source T ,
E, and B ﬂuctuations, observational searches for bispec-
tra constructed from T and E ﬂuctuations naturally place
constraints on both scalar and tensor non-Gaussianity.
Just as in the case of the power spectrum, the contri-
butions to T and E ﬂuctuations from scalars are much
larger than those of tensors, and so constraints on tensor
non-Gaussianity with these bispectra are relatively weak.
On the other hand, bispectra involving primordial B-
mode ﬂuctuations are sourced by tensor non-Gaussianity
but not by scalar non-Gaussianity, and are therefore ca-
pable of providing a much tighter constraint on tensor
non-Gaussianity. Since observations of B-modes are not
presently cosmic variance-limited, there is a great deal of
room for improvement with future observations of the
CMB polarization. This reasoning strongly motivates
searching for bispectra involving primordial B-modes as
a probe of primordial non-Gaussianity. In this paper, we
explore in detail how the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bispectrum can be used
to constrain tensor non-Gaussianity and thereby give us
insight into the physics of the early universe.

The primordial tensor-scalar-scalar bispectrum is nat-
urally non-vanishing, and in fact is of the same order
in slow-roll parameters as the primordial scalar-scalar-
scalar bispectrum in the simplest models of single-ﬁeld
slow-roll inﬂation [42]. In more general models, the shape
and amplitude of the tensor-scalar-scalar bispectrum can
diﬀer quite signiﬁcantly from those predicted in the sim-
plest models, so observational constraints on this quan-

tity give non-trivial insight into the physics of the early
Universe [43]. The primordial tensor-tensor-scalar and
tensor-tensor-tensor bispectra are also non-vanishing in
single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation, as well as in more gen-
eral models [42–44]. Primordial non-Gaussianity involv-
ing tensors provides a set of observables which are dis-
tinct from and complementary to scalar non-Gaussianity.
Also, just as in the case of scalars [16], there is in prin-
ciple much more information in tensor non-Gaussianity
than in the tensor power spectrum alone.

Despite the diﬀering intrinsic parity of temperature
ﬂuctuations and B-modes, the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bispectrum is non-
vanishing for particular combinations of multipoles. To
be more speciﬁc, under spatial inversion the multipole
coeﬃcients for T , E, and B transform as [45]

(cid:96)(cid:48)m(cid:48)(cid:105) = (cid:104)aB

These properties along with statistical isotropy imply
that (cid:104)aB
(cid:96)(cid:48)m(cid:48)(cid:105) = 0 in a parity-conserving
universe since these quantities change sign under spatial
inversion. On the other hand, we ﬁnd that under spatial
inversion, the bispectrum of interest transforms as
(cid:104)aT
(cid:96)1m1aT
(cid:96)3m3(cid:105),
which therefore must vanish in a parity-conserving uni-
n (cid:96)n = odd (see

The above remarks straightforwardly generalize to all
forms of non-Gaussianity. In a parity-conserving and sta-
tistically isotropic universe, any connected N -point func-
tion constructed from T , E, and B ﬂuctuations contain-
ing an odd number of B-mode ﬂuctuations vanishes for
n (cid:96)n = odd, while those con-
taining an even number of B-mode ﬂuctuations vanish
n (cid:96)n = even. The case of
N = 2 is special since statistical isotropy always implies
that (cid:96)1 + (cid:96)2 = even for two-point statistics.

n (cid:96)n = even but not for(cid:80)

Let us brieﬂy summarize our motivations. Non-
Gaussian CMB statistics involving B-mode ﬂuctuations
are non-vanishing under standard assumptions about the
properties of our Universe. Existing data can be used to
place new constraints on these quantities. Present mea-
surements of B-modes are not cosmic-variance limited, so

the correlation function in multipole space is of the form

upcoming lower-noise CMB polarization data will drasti-
cally improve upon our current capabilities in this regard.
Measurements of these statistics can provide non-trivial
constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity involving ten-
sor ﬂuctuations. Primordial tensor non-Gaussianity is in
general independent of primordial scalar non-Gaussianity
and is therefore a complementary probe of early-universe
physics.

The goal of this paper is to explore the potential of
the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bispectrum as a probe of the primordial Uni-
verse. In Sec. II we discuss the geometric properties of
the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bispectrum. In Sec. III we review the predic-
tions of single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation for the primordial
tensor-scalar-scalar bispectrum and discuss its proper-
ties. We use this result as a template to construct the
(cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bispectrum in the ﬂat-sky limit in Sec. IV. We
then estimate the signal-to-noise ratio of this observable
in Sec. V for current and future experiments. We dis-
cuss the implications and future extensions of our work
in Sec. VI.

II. GEOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE (cid:104)BT T(cid:105)

BISPECTRUM

In this Section we outline the general geometric proper-
ties of the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) correlation function in the ﬂat-sky ap-
proximation. We start by considering properties of cor-
relation functions involving the polarization tensor P ab.

correlation function
(cid:104)T (x1)P ab(x2)(cid:105). Statistical homogeneity implies that
this can only be a function of x12 ≡ x1 − x2. Since
P ab is a symmetric, trace-free tensor, so must be this
correlation function, which must therefore take the form

Similarly, one can show that statistical homogene-
ity and isotropy imply that the three-point function
(cid:104)T ((cid:96)1)T ((cid:96)2)P ab((cid:96)3)(cid:105) takes the form

(cid:104)T ((cid:96)1)T ((cid:96)2)P ab((cid:96)3)(cid:105) = δ(2)((cid:96)1 + (cid:96)2 + (cid:96)3)

where we also used the fact that P ab is symmetric
and trace-free. The symmetry of the three-point func-
tion under interchange of (cid:96)1 and (cid:96)2 moreover imposes
G22((cid:96)1, (cid:96)2, (cid:96)3) = G11((cid:96)2, (cid:96)1, (cid:96)3) and G23((cid:96)1, (cid:96)2, (cid:96)3) =
G13((cid:96)2, (cid:96)1, (cid:96)3).

We emphasize that an implicit underlying assumption
to derive these general results is that the physics govern-
ing temperature and polarization ﬂuctuations is parity-
conserving, both at the level of initial conditions, and for
their subsequent evolution. Explicitly, this implies that
the antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor  cannot appear in
any of the above correlation functions.

B.

Implications for E and B-modes

We recall that in the ﬂat-sky limit, the E- and B-
mode decomposition of the polarization tensor ﬁeld P ab
is obtained as follows [46]

∇2E ≡ ∂a∂bP ab,
∇2B ≡ ac∂c∂bP ab,

(4)
(5)

where repeated indices are summed. While E is a scalar
quantity, B is a pseudo-scalar, or parity-odd observable:
its sign depends on the chosen handedness of the coordi-
nate system. In multipole space, we have

E((cid:96)) ≡ ˆ(cid:96)a ˆ(cid:96)bP ab((cid:96)),
B((cid:96)) ≡ ac ˆ(cid:96)c ˆ(cid:96)bP ab((cid:96)).

Using these equations into Eq. (2), we obtain

(cid:104)T ((cid:96))E((cid:96)(cid:48))(cid:105) = δ(2)((cid:96) + (cid:96)(cid:48))G((cid:96)),
(cid:104)T ((cid:96))B((cid:96)(cid:48))(cid:105) = 0,

Substituting Eq.

where the vanishing of the (cid:104)BT(cid:105) correlation results from
the antisymmetry of .
(3), we see that
(cid:104)T ((cid:96)1)T ((cid:96)2)E((cid:96)3)(cid:105) only depends on the magnitudes (cid:96)i
and on the scalar products between the three multipoles.
The triangle condition (cid:96)1 + (cid:96)2 + (cid:96)3 = 0 implies that the

FIG. 2: Two unique slices showing the primordial tensor-scalar-scalar bispectrum from single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation with k3
representing the wave vector of the tensor. Left: The bispectrum is enhanced when k3 (cid:28) k1 ∼ k2 (top left corner). The
enfolded limit, i.e. k1 + k2 = k3 (bottom left edge), is suppressed, since then all momenta are aligned. Right: When one or
both scalar momenta k1 and k2 are aligned with the tensor momentum k3 (bottom left edge) the spectrum is suppressed as
compared to the equilateral conﬁguration (top right).

scalar product of any two multipoles can be rewritten as
a function of the magnitudes only. We therefore obtain

where the prime indicates that we divided by δ(2)((cid:80) (cid:96)i)

(cid:104)T ((cid:96)1)T ((cid:96)2)E((cid:96)3)(cid:105)(cid:48) = G((cid:96)1, (cid:96)2, (cid:96)3),

(10)

and G is some function of the magnitudes (cid:96)i, symmetric
under exchange of (cid:96)1, (cid:96)2.
Substituting Eq. (7) into Eq. (3), we see that some of
the terms vanish (e.g. the G33 term), but not all of them.
The ﬁnal form of the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) correlation function is
(cid:104)T ((cid:96)1)T ((cid:96)2)B((cid:96)3)(cid:105)(cid:48) = (ˆ(cid:96)1 × ˆ(cid:96)3) H((cid:96)1, (cid:96)2, (cid:96)3)

where ˆ(cid:96)1 × ˆ(cid:96)3 ≡ ac ˆ(cid:96)a
Geometrically, this can be understood as follows. Con-
sider two triangles in multipole space that are mirrored
images of one another in the way shown in Fig. 1. The
magnitudes of all wavenumbers are identical (hence the
scalar products between any two of them). However, the
cross products ˆ(cid:96)1 × ˆ(cid:96)3 and ˆ(cid:96)2 × ˆ(cid:96)3 take on opposite signs
on the two triangles. This implies that the values of the
tree-point function (cid:104)ET T(cid:105) is identical on both triangles,
whereas (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) has the same absolute value but takes a
diﬀerent sign on the two mirrored triangles. A violation
of these symmetry properties would be an indicator for
parity-violating physics [47].

III. PRIMORDIAL BISPECTRUM

In this section, we will review the properties of the
primordial tensor-scalar-scalar bispectrum predicted in
single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation, which were ﬁrst obtained
in Ref. [42]. This model provides an example of tensor
non-Gaussianity in the simplest of inﬂationary models,

which we will use as a template to compute the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105)
bispectrum. For more general models, the primordial
bispectrum will diﬀer from the results presented here,
and modiﬁcations should be made to the template to
address these changes.

Following the work by Maldacena [42], for inﬂation
driven by a single slowly-rolling scalar ﬁeld, the primor-
dial bispectrum of two scalar ﬂuctuations and one tensor
ﬂuctuation is given by

(cid:10)ζ(k1)ζ(k2)h±(k3)(cid:11) = (2π)3F 00±2(k1, k2, k3)

The tensor-scalar-scalar bispectrum has two diﬀerent
squeezed limits: one in which the wavenumber of the
tensor is much smaller than those of the scalars (kh (cid:28)
kζ1 ∼ kζ2), and another in which the wavenumber of one
of the two scalars is much smaller than those of the other
scalar and of the tensor (kζ2 (cid:28) kh ∼ kζ1 ). In the former
case, if the scalar wavenumbers are perpendicular to the
tensor wavenumber the bispectrum is enhanced. Con-
versely, the enfolded limit, when both scalar wavenum-
bers are roughly aligned with the tensor wavenumber the
bispectrum is suppressed by the polarization sum.

We propose a reference deﬁnition of the primordial

tensor-scalar-scalar bispectrum of the form

single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation, I(k1, k2, k3) = I(k1, k2, k3)
and f hζζ
NL = ∗, but these quantities will diﬀer in more
general models.
In the squeezed limit where the tensor wavenumber is
much smaller than the wavenumbers of the scalars, the
properties of the bispectrum in single-ﬁeld slow-roll in-
ﬂation are entirely determined by the fact that the long-
wavelength tensor ﬂuctuation is locally equivalent to an
anisotropic rescaling of coordinates [42]. This tensor con-
sistency condition applies more broadly than the more fa-
miliar scalar consistency condition, since the same logic
will apply to any scalar ﬁeld minimally coupled to grav-
ity, whether or not its energy density drives inﬂation [43].
For this reason, if single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation or some-
thing similar is responsible for the primordial ﬂuctuations
we observe, we are unlikely to gain much insight into the
physics from the squeezed limit of the tensor-scalar-scalar
bispectrum, but it remains interesting to search for devi-
ations from the predictions of the simplest models.

IV.

(cid:104)BT T(cid:105) IN THE FLAT-SKY LIMIT

The full-sky CMB (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bispectrum has been worked
out before in Ref. [48] and using total angular momentum

5

spherical harmonics in Ref. [49]. However, both results
lead to expressions that are not very transparent regard-
ing the symmetries of this correlation function. Here in-
stead, we derive the spectrum in the ﬂat-sky approxima-
tion were these symmetries, which we derived in Sec. II,
are immediately apparent. The results presented here
are accurate as long as we restrict ourselves to scales

our forecasts focus on experiments that will most likely

(cid:104)T T T(cid:105) bispectrum. We see explicitly that the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bispectrum changes sign under the interchange of of the two T multipoles
(cid:96)1 and (cid:96)2 and vanishes when (cid:96)1 = (cid:96)2. The overall amplitude of (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) for our chosen template is almost three orders of
magnitude smaller than the local template (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) bispectrum from scalars.

form Eq. (11), and as a consequence has the symmetry
properties discussed in Sec. II.

We show BT T B

have chosen a particular template for the presentation
here, we emphasize that in principle forecasted bounds
on f hζζ
NL can be obtained for any model that predicts the
coupling of two scalars and a tensor by using the appro-
priate k-dependent shape I(k1, k2, k3). In this paper we
will use the shape of Eq. (14) as an example, but will
not assume a speciﬁc amplitude for f hζζ
NL unless stated
otherwise.

V. CMB FORECASTS

A. Qualitative considerations

Before we compute the signal-to-noise ratio,

let us
make some qualitative estimates. The temperature ﬂuc-
tuation is mostly sourced by primordial scalar ﬂuctua-
tions, while the B-mode polarization is sourced by pri-
mordial tensor ﬂuctuations:

T ∼ ST ζ,
B ∼ SB h.

(24)
(25)

The (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) and (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) three-point functions therefore
have the following ratio:

(cid:104)BT T(cid:105)
(cid:104)T T T(cid:105) ∼

SB
ST

(cid:104)hζζ(cid:105)
(cid:104)ζζζ(cid:105)

.

(26)

We assume that the temperature ﬂuctuation is measured
up to cosmic variance, implying σ2
T(cid:104)ζ 2(cid:105). In
contrast, accounting for instrumental noise, the variance
of the B-mode ﬂuctuation is

T,cv ∼ S2

T = σ2

mordial B-modes and σ2
B,inst is the instrumental noise
(and in practice also contains residual B-modes from
lensing and foregrounds). As a consequence, the ratio
of the variance of the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) estimator to that of the
(cid:104)T T T(cid:105) estimator is

ratio of the signal-to-noise ratio for the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) estimator
to that of the (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) estimator is therefore

Now, while (cid:104)h2(cid:105)/(cid:104)ζ 2(cid:105) = r (cid:28) 1, the ratio of the three-
point functions (cid:104)hζζ(cid:105)/(cid:104)ζζζ(cid:105) is of order O(ε0) in single-
ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation (and not of order √ε as one might
naively expect). We therefore see that in the limit that
the instrumental noise for B is subdominant to cosmic
variance (σ2
B,cv), the expected signal-to-noise
ratio of (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) is larger than that of (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) by a factor
1/√r (cid:29) 1. In the other limit σ2
B,cv, this ratio
saturates to a value independent of r (since σ2
B,cv ∝ r).
Similarly, the advantage of using (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) over (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) to
constrain (cid:104)hζζ(cid:105) is immediately apparent from Eq. (29) by
replacing (cid:104)hζζ(cid:105)/(cid:104)ζζζ(cid:105) → 1, showing that for suﬃciently
low values of r, (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) will always provide a better con-
straint than (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) on (cid:104)hζζ(cid:105) independent of the model.
Therefore, we see that while lower noise measurements
of temperature ﬂuctuations will not lead to signiﬁcant
further improvement of the measurement of primordial
non-Gaussianity from (cid:104)T T T(cid:105), there is a great deal of
room for improvement with (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) as a probe of pri-
mordial physics.

FIG. 4: Top: the B-mode power spectrum computed on the full sky and in the ﬂat-sky, thin-shell, approximation. The ﬂat-sky
approximation holds all the way down to (cid:96) (cid:39) 10. Bottom: the local-type temperature bispectrum in the full sky and ﬂat sky
(thin-shell) for (cid:96)1 = (cid:96)2 = (cid:96)3. There are some diﬀerences on large scales, but for computing the signal-to-noise ratio we do not
expect these to lead to signiﬁcant deviations. Note that for purposes of presentation, the total spectrum is divided by the large
scale analytical limit of the local bispectrum. [51, 52].

B. Quantitative calculation

In the ﬂat-sky approximation the signal-to-noise ratio
is given by the following integral over multipoles (rather
than a discrete sum in the full-sky case) [53]:

where C(cid:96) is the angular power spectrum, and we inte-
grated out the (cid:96)1 direction.

To compute the signal-to-noise ratio, we modiﬁed
CAMB [54, 55] and CLASS [56] to extract the scalar and
polarization source functions. We then computed the
bispectrum using Eq. (22) and the signal-to-noise ratio
using Eq. (30). For consistency we also used the ﬂat-sky
C(cid:96) for our variance estimate. We compared our C(cid:96) to the
full-sky results and found good agreement for (cid:96) (cid:38) 10 as
can be seen in the top panel of Fig. 4. We also show the
diagonal of the (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) ﬂat sky bispectrum versus the full-
sky version in the bottom panel of Fig 4. Unlike Ref. [51],
we ﬁnd good agreement all the way down to (cid:96) ∼ 10− 20.
For purposes of computing the signal-to-noise ratio of the
(cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bispectrum, the small amplitude diﬀerences are
not a concern. That being said, there is potentially a
signiﬁcant contribution to the signal-to-noise ratio in the
lowest-(cid:96) B-modes, given the presence of the reionization
bump at low (cid:96) which is not included due to the approx-
imations we have made here. We will leave the full-sky
computation including these modes for a future study.

All results are obtained using a Planck ﬁducial cos-
mology, kmax = 0.64 Mpc−1 for scalars and kmax = 0.17

Mpc−1 for tensors. We performed calculations to max-
imal multipoles of (cid:96)T,max = 4500 for the T modes
and to (cid:96)B,max = 1000 for the B modes. On small
scales in the temperature, foreground ﬂuctuations such
as the emission from dusty, star-forming galaxies and
thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich eﬀect will reduce the eﬀec-
tive maximal temperature multipole for primordial stud-
ies to about 3000–4000. Given multifrequency data,
these could in principle be removed, leaving the kinetic
Sunyaev-Zel’dovich eﬀect as the dominant foreground on
small scales. Depending on the amplitude of this sig-
nal, this could make the maximal multipole as large as
(cid:96)T,max ∼ 4500 [57]. For simplicity we leave the maximal
temperature multipole as a free parameter in our results.
The bispectra were computed with a sampling of ∆(cid:96) =
20. We have checked the accuracy of our broad bins
(cid:96)max = 256 and ∆(cid:96) = 1 and found that the low resolution
sampling leads to an underestimate of the signal-to-noise
ratio by about a factor of 2, which we have corrected for
in our estimates.

We assume that the noise power spectra in the T and

B measurements are given by

B(SPIDER)×T T (SPT) [58] would be similar to that
the noise levels are
from BICEP/Keck and SPTpol:
lower, but that is oﬀset by the relatively small sky
coverage of BICEP/Keck-SPTpol. We consider two
distinct scenarios, represented by the limiting cases of
Eq. (29): ﬁrst, the case that there is no signal from
primordial tensors where we set C BB
; second,
the B-mode cosmic variance limit for various values of
the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. All bounds are shown as
functions of (cid:96)T max; Fig. 5 shows that multipoles with
(cid:96)B (cid:38) 100 hardly contribute to the ﬁnal bounds. In the
same plot we show how the bounds would change if r
is detected at various levels. If r < 0.001, CMB-S4 will
still be noise limited.

(cid:96)

In single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation, it is predicted that
f hζζ
NL = r/16, and so in the event that cosmological B-
modes are detected, this will provide a consistency check
on the model. As can be seen from Fig. 6, sample vari-
ance prevents us from detecting f hζζ
NL from (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) if
single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation is the source of the ﬂuc-
tuations we observe. A detection of f hζζ
NL would therefore
imply that single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation is not solely re-
sponsible for the observed ﬂuctuations.

NL ∼ O(0.1)f−1/2
sky .

With an experiment like CMB-Stage IV [59] we an-
ticipate that we can constrain f hζζ
It
is remarkable that the potential constraint on primor-
dial non-Gaussianity using (cid:104)BT T(cid:105), which, given a sim-
ilar shape and normalization of the tensor-scalar-scalar
bispectrum and the scalar-scalar-scalar bispectrum, lies
an order of magnitude below the optimal CMB con-
straint on f local
NL . Furthermore, it was shown in Ref. [48]
that the (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) bispectrum could provide constraints on
NL ∼ O(10)f−1/2
f hζζ
sky . The forecasts presented in this pa-
per show that using (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) improves that constraint by
nearly two orders of magnitude if r turns out to be small.
In order to fully exploit the power of (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) one should
consider more general models of the early Universe that
could potentially violate this bound. We will leave this
to future work.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have explored the potential of the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bispec-
trum as probe of the early universe. The odd intrinsic
parity of B-modes gives this bispectrum some properties
which diﬀer from that of the (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) bispectrum, but both
are generically non-vanishing in a parity-conserving uni-

FIG. 5: Density plot showing the concentration of signal-to-
noise ratio in the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bispectrum. The color map on the
bottom left, which uses a linear scale, shows the contribution
to the signal-to-noise ratio as a function of the B multipole
and one of the two T multipoles. The other panels show the
collapsed one-dimensional distributions. The signal is concen-
trated in slices with small (cid:96)B and a wide range of values of (cid:96)T .
We show constraints from several experiments, assuming no
sample variance in the B modes, as well as with the cosmic
variance limit for r = 0.1. The color map corresponds to the
CMB-S4 case.

in Fig. 5. As expected, the signal is concentrated on slices
with (cid:96)B (cid:28) (cid:96)T , and T modes contribute down to very
small scales ((cid:96)T (cid:39) several thousand). For comparison, we
show a similar plot for the (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) bispectrum resulting
from local-type primordial non-Gaussianity in Fig. 7.
To be as general as possible, we will plot the common
variance of f hζζ
NL = 1.
Using Eq. (30) we obtain the forecast for the uncertainty

satellite, such as the proposed LiteBIRD [61], PIXIE [62]
or COrE [63] experiments.

We focused in this work on a template for the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105)
bispectrum motivated by single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation,
which maximizes when large-scale B modes are corre-
lated with small-scale T modes. This shape has some
experimental advantages, since a search for such a bis-
pectrum could be performed,
for instance, by cross-
correlating a map of B-modes on large scales from a cur-
rent or upcoming ground-based CMB experiment with
small-scale T ﬂuctuations, such as those measured with
the Planck satellite. On the other hand, it would be use-
ful to consider other shapes for the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bispectrum,
perhaps motivated by speciﬁc early-universe models.
In this work we have not considered contamination
from dust, systematics, or lensing. Dust is a well-known
contaminant in estimates of the (cid:104)BB(cid:105) power spectrum on
large scales at the frequencies probed with ground-based
experiments. Estimates of the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bispectrum will in
principle be sensitive to correlations between large-scale
dust polarization and small-scale dust intensity; while
this may be less of an issue than in the power spectrum
measure, this needs to be investigated in future work.
Similarly, instrumental systematics which aﬀect the mea-
sure of B on large scales should be decoupled from those
that aﬀect T on small scales, making this analysis less
sensitive to systematics than the (cid:104)BB(cid:105) power spectrum.
Finally, lensing converts E-mode polarization to B-mode
polarization. As with measurements of the (cid:104)BB(cid:105) power
spectrum, delensing to reduce eﬀective noise from lens-
ing needs to be performed when measuring the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105)
bispectrum. In a universe with primordial gravitational
waves, the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bispectrum will also contain a non-
primordial signal on very large scales arising from corre-
lations between B-modes from Thomson scattering after
reionization and the curl mode of CMB lensing, which af-
fects pairs of temperature modes [64]. This is analogous
to the scattered E-mode–lensing correlation induced by
scalars in estimates of the (cid:104)ET T(cid:105) bispectrum [65].
We have focused on the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) correlation function.
However, other combinations sensitive to the coupling
between scalars and tensors will add to the total signal-
to-noise ratio. In particular, (cid:104)BEE(cid:105) and (cid:104)BT E(cid:105) are ex-
pected to have similar constraining power. In addition,
similar to the use of E-modes for the scalar bispectrum
[60], the B and E modes are projected through functions
that have diﬀerent nulls, which improves the mapping
from the primordial space. In summary, the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bis-
pectrum and other non-Gaussian correlations involving
B-modes open up a new window into the early Universe.
Ongoing and future CMB experiments will naturally
make observations which allow us to carry out searches
for and place non-trivial constraints on primordial tensor
non-Gaussianity. While more theoretical work remains to
discover the full value of B-mode non-Gaussianity, this
new set of observables has the potential to be a very rich
set of tools for probing primordial physics.

FIG. 6: Forecasts for ∆f hζζ
NL for various CMB experiments.
The gray bands represent the bounds from a cosmic variance-
limited experiment for a universe with a given value of the
tensor-to-scalar ratio r, where each band diﬀers by one order
of magnitude in r. For example, if we measure r = 0.1 from
(cid:104)BB(cid:105) our constraint is ∆f hζζ

cosmic variance-limited temperature modes up to (cid:96) = 4500.

verse, and are sourced by primordial bispectra which are
predicted to be of the same order in slow-roll parameters
in single-ﬁeld slow-roll inﬂation.

One advantage of the (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) bispectrum is that the
signal suﬀers less from cosmic variance than its (cid:104)T T T(cid:105)
counterpart for constraining the tensor-scalar-scalar bis-
pectrum. Our analysis shows that with this observ-
able it should be possible to constrain the level of non-
NL ∼ O(0.1)f−1/2
Gaussianity to ∆f hζζ
sky . For comparison,
the CMB can only measure the local-type scalar bispec-
trum down to ∆f ζζζ
NL ∼ O(1) [12, 60] and with upcoming
large-scale-structure surveys aimed at constraining non-
Gaussianity using galaxies, ∆f ζζζ
Our analysis was done in the ﬂat-sky limit, valid for
multipoles (cid:96) (cid:38) 10, which suﬃces for ground-based detec-
tors. It will be important to extend this analysis to the
full sky since there is potentially signiﬁcant signal in the
lowest (cid:96) modes, given the presence of the relatively large
B ﬂuctuation from scattering at reionization. This sig-
nal can most likely only be mapped out by a dedicated

NL ∼ 0.2 [13].

In this appendix, we work out the form of the three-point function (cid:104)BT T(cid:105) in the ﬂat-sky approximation. Our
We start by rewriting D = DR + ˜D, where DR ≡ τ0 − τR and ˜D ≡ τR − τ , in the exponential factors of Eqs. (20)
and (21). The Dirac delta function in the primordial three-point function ensures that the DR dependence drops of
the exponential factors. Using Eqs. (20) and (21), we then get the following three-point function

Assuming the kernel F does not vary signiﬁcantly across the width of the last-scattering surface (i.e. speciﬁcally, that
it does not change much as ki varies by a fractional amount ∆τR/τR ∼ 10−2 [50]), we can take it out of the time
(cid:33)
integrals, by setting k||n ≈ (cid:96)n/DR inside F . Using k||n = (cid:96)n/Dn, the Dirac function in Eq. (A2) simpliﬁes to

Because the last equality is only approximate, the bispectrum does not exactly vanish for modes that do not form a
closed triangle; however, it is exponentially suppressed on these conﬁgurations [66].

We can ﬁnd the polarization tensor for an arbitrary direction by performing a standard rotation on each axis of the
polarization tensor. For ˆn = (sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ), the standard rotation matrix S(ˆn) is given by [45]

The polarization sum for k3 = k3(sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ, cos θ) in an arbitrary direction is such that

Due to rotational invariance, we can, without loss of generality, choose k3 to have vanishing y-component. Once we
compute the bispectrum for this choice of k3, all bispectra with general k3 can be obtained by rotation about the
z-axis. For k3 in the xz-plane, the polarization sum gives

Using the triangle condition, and substituting k||i = (kx

G(k1, k2, k3) = (ky

where the last equality arises from the fact that we chose k3 in the xz-plane, implying that (cid:96)y

Finally, we may rewrite (cid:96)y

an expression which is symmetric under exchange of (1 ↔ 2) since (cid:96)2 × (cid:96)3 = −(cid:96)1 × (cid:96)3. The scalar products can be
expressed in terms of magnitudes through 2(cid:96)1 · (cid:96)3 = (cid:96)2
Inserting this expression into Eq. (A5) and then into Eq. (A4) gives the ﬁnal expression for the ﬂat-sky bispectrum,
Eq. (22). Using the property ∆s
2, one can easily show
that the three-point function (A4) is real, as it should. Finally, we also see that it has the same form as that derived
in Eq. (11) from symmetry considerations.
