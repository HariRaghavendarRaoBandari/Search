On Nyquist-Shannon Theorem with one-sided half of sampling

sequence

Nikolai Dokuchaev

Submitted March 14, 2016

Abstract

The classical sampling Nyquist-Shannon-Kotelnikov theorem states that a band-limited con-
tinuous time function can be uniquely recovered without error from a inﬁnite two-sided sampling
series taken with a sufﬁcient frequency. This short note shows that the function can be recovered
from any one-sided semi-inﬁnite half of any oversampling series, with the same boundary for ad-
missible frequencies as in the classical theorem.

Keywords: sampling, Nyquist-Shannon-Kotelnikov Theorem, bandlimitness, missing values,

one-sided sequences.

Introduction

This short note suggest a modiﬁcation of the classical sampling theorem that is also known as
Nyquist-Shannon theorem, Nyquist-Shannon-Kotelnikov theorem, Whittaker-Shannon-Kotelnikov the-

orem, Whittaker-Nyquist-Kotelnikov-Shannon theorem, which is one of the most basic results in the
theory of signal processing and information science. This theorem states that any band-limited func-
tion can be uniquely recovered without error from a inﬁnite two-sided equidistand sampling sequence

taken with sufﬁcient frequency. This result was obtained independently by four authors [19, 10, 9, 13].
Numerous extensions of this theorem were obtained, including the case of nonuniform sampling and

restoration of the signal with mixed samples; see some recent literature review in [1, 16, 17]. In par-
ticular, it is known that a bandlimited function can be recovered without error from a sample if a ﬁnite

number of sample values is unknown. It is also known [7] that the function can be recovered without
error if a inﬁnite subsequence of the sample values located on the same distance is missing, with some

additional constraints on the signal band and frequencies [7]. In this paper, we show that, with the same

boundary for admissible frequencies as for the classical Nyquist-Shannon-Kotelnikov Theorem, any
band-limited function can be uniquely recovered without error from any one-sided semi-inﬁnite half of
any oversampling equidistant sampling series, with the same boundary for admissible frequencies as

in the classical theorem. This means that any one-sided semi-inﬁnite half of equidistand oversampling
series can be deemed redundant: the function still can be restored without error from the remaining

part.

2 Some deﬁnitions

We denote by L2(D) the usual Hilbert space of complex valued square integrable functions x : D → C,
where D is a domain.

For x(·) ∈ L2(R), we denote by X = Fx the function deﬁned on iR as the Fourier transform of

Here i = √−1 is the imaginary unit. For x(·) ∈ L2(R), the Fourier transform X is deﬁned as an
element of L2(iR), i.e. X(i·) ∈ L2(R)).

(R) be the subset of L2(R) consisting of functions x such that x(t) =

(F −1X)(t), where X(iω) ∈ L2(iR) and X(iω) = 0 for |ω| > Ω}.

We denote by Z the set of all integers.

3 The main result

2

Theorem 1 Let Ω > 0 and τ ∈ (0, π/Ω) be given. Let {tk}k∈Z ⊂ R be a sequence such that
tk − tk−1 = τ for all k. For any s ∈ Z, a band-limited function f ∈ LBL,Ω
(R) is uniquely deﬁned by
the values {f (tk)}k≤s.
Remark 1 The value τ = π/Ω is excluded in Theorem 1, meaning that the series {tk} oversamples
f ; this is essential for the proof. This value is allowed in the classical Nyquist-Shannon-Kotelnikov
Theorem with two-sided sampling series that states that f ∈ LBL,Ω
(R) is uniquely deﬁned by the
values {f (tk)}k∈Z if τ ∈ (0, Ω/π].
Remark 2 Theorem 1 considers the left hand half {f (tk)}k≤s of the sampling series; it is convenient
for representation of past historical observations, for instance, for predicting problems. However, the
same statement can be formulated for the right hand half {f (tk)}k≥s of the sampling series.

for any ﬁnite set S, f is uniquely deﬁned by the values

The fact that, for any ﬁnite set S, f ∈ LBL,Ω

(R) is uniquely deﬁned by the values {f (tk)}k∈Z\S,
is known; it was established in [6] by a different method. Theorem 1 extents this result: it shows that
the same is also true for inﬁnite sets S = {t : t > s}, for any given s ∈ Z. It is known that the same
is not true for some other inﬁnite sets. For example, if S = {t2k+1, k ∈ Z} and 2τ > Ω/π, then
f ∈ LBL,Ω
(R) is not uniquely deﬁned by the values {f (tk)}k∈Z\S, since the frequency of the sample
{f (t2k)}k∈Z is lower than is required by the Nyquist-Shannon-Kotelnikov Theorem; see more detailed
analysis in [7].

4 Proofs

It sufﬁces to proof Theorem 1 for s = 0 only; the extension on s 6= 0 is straightforward.

Let us introduce some additional notations ﬁrst.

For W ∈ (0, π), let LW (T) be the set of all mappings X : T → C such that X (cid:0)eiω(cid:1) ∈ L2(−π, π)
and X (cid:0)eiω(cid:1) = 0 for |ω| > W . We will call the the corresponding processes x = Z −1X band-limited.

Here G is such that G(cid:0)eiν(cid:1) = τ −1F (iν/τ ). We used here a change of variables ν = ωτ . Since
F (cid:0)eiν/τ(cid:1) ∈ L2(iR), it follows that G(cid:0)eiν(cid:1) ∈ L2(T). By the assumption that τ < π/Ω, it follows that

5 Discussion and future developments

1. To apply the classical Nyquist-Shannon-Kotelnikov Theorem for the data recovery, one has to
restore the Fourier transform F = Ff from the two-sided sampling series {f (tk)}k∈Z. This
procedure is relatively straightforward. In contrast, application of Theorem 1 for the data recovery

requires to restore Z-transform G(cid:0)eiν(cid:1) = F (iω/τ ) from an one-sided half of the sampling series.

By Lemma 1, this task is feasible; however, it is numerically challenging. Some numerical

algorithms based on projection were suggested in [4] and [5].

2. Some inﬁnite equidistant sets of sampling points that can be redundant for recoverability of the

underlying function were described in [7]. It could be interesting to ﬁnd other inﬁnite sets with
this feature.

3. It could be interesting to investigate if recovery of f suggested in Theorem 1 is robust with respect

to errors in location of the sampling points tk.

4. It is unclear if our approach based on predictability of discrete time processes is applicable to
processes deﬁned on multidimensional lattices. It could be interesting to extend this approach on
process f (t), t ∈ R2, using the setting from [11].
