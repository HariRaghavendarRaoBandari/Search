We describe theoretically the depairing eﬀect of a microwave ﬁeld on diﬀusive s-wave supercon-
ductors. The ground state of the superconductor is altered qualitatively in analogy to the depairing
due to a dc current. In contrast to dc-depairing the density of states acquires, for microwaves with
frequency ω0, steps at multiples of the photon energy ∆ ± nω0 and shows an exponential-like tail
in the subgap regime. We show that this ac-depairing explains the measured frequency shift of a
superconducting resonator at high microwave power and low temperatures.

How is the superconducting state modiﬁed by a cur-
rent, i.e when the condensate is moving? The answer
to this question is well-known for the case of a dc cur-
rent ﬂowing in a superconducting wire. In this case the
Cooper pairs gain a ﬁnite momentum which leads to
the suppression of the superconducting properties of the
wire1. The modulus of the superconducting order param-
eter ∆ is reduced and the sharp BCS singularity near the
gap is smeared. This depairing eﬀect of a current or of
a magnetic ﬁeld was studied theoretically soon after the
creation of the microscopic theory of superconductivity2.
This moving condensate has been called a coherent ex-
cited state generated by the momentum displacement op-

erator ρq = Pn exp(iq · rn) by Anderson3 as part of the

explanation of the Meissner eﬀect from the original from
of the BCS theory. This momentum displacement op-
erator, when applied to the BCS ground state, creates
excited pairs of electrons k1, k2 with momentum pair-
ing k1 + k2 = q instead of zero. A similar momen-
tum displacement q was introduced4–6 in the calcula-
tion of the critical current of a one-dimensional super-
conductor, using the Bogoliubov-De Gennes equations.
This momentum displacement q corresponds to a super-
ﬂuid drift velocity vs = q/m, where m is the electron
mass.
In the Green’s function technique it is possible
to introduce the superﬂuid velocity in a gauge invari-
ant way vs ∝ [∇ϕ − (2e/)A], where ϕ is the phase
of the superconductor. It permits to take into account
an electromagnetic ﬁeld described by the vector poten-
tial A. The equivalence of depairing due to an electric
current and due to a magnetic ﬁeld is well established,

both theoretically7 and experimentally1, using thin and
narrow superconducting wires with a uniform current-
density (thickness and width of the wire much smaller
than the appropriate penetration depth λ). The theory of
depairing by a dc current was reformulated, using the Us-
adel equations8, for diﬀusive ﬁlms with an elastic scatter-
ing length much smaller than the BCS coherence length9.
The results of this theory9 were conﬁrmed experimentally
by Romijn et al10 and by Anthore et al1. At present, the
Usadel equations have become the standard framework
for the theoretical study of diﬀusive superconductors11.

However, a general theory for depairing by a microwave
ﬁeld, a time-dependent vector potential A, has not been
formulated. In current experimental research there are
many cases in which a superconductor is used at very
low temperatures, T /Tc ≪ 1, where the density of quasi-
particles is very low and the response of the supercon-
ductor is dominated by the response of the superﬂuid.
At higher temperatures it is well known that microwave
radiation can be absorbed by quasi-particles, leading to
a non-equilibrium distribution over the energies12. At
very low temperatures there are hardly any quasiparti-
cles and with ω ≪ 2∆ there is not enough energy per
photon to break Cooper-pairs.
In practice it has been
demonstrated that in this regime the microwave power
has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the superconducting state.
For example De Visser et al13,14 have measured for alu-
minium a shift in kinetic inductance and an increase in
the density of quasiparticles as a function of microwave
power at temperatures of 60 mK. This dependence can be
parametrized by labeling it as ’absorbed power’, but the

fundamental question is how the superconducting state
responds to a time-dependent electromagnetic ﬁeld. In
previous works only the limiting case of high tempera-
tures (close to the critical temperature Tc)15 or relatively
low frequency (ω0 ≪ kBT )16 compared to the tempera-
ture were studied. In these cases the coherent properties
of a superconductor (e.g. density of states) changes anal-
ogous to magnetic impurities and a static magnetic ﬁeld.
However, in general it is to be expected that an oscillat-
ing vector-potential would lead to coherent excited pairs
with an oscillating center of mass motion, with a more
substantial modiﬁcation of the density of states. The
change of the energy spectrum of electrons, dressed by
an electromagnetic ﬁeld, is in principle analogous to the
dynamic Stark eﬀect in atom physics17 (and similarly for
a two-dimensional electron gas18). These Floquet-type
states have recently been put forward in the analysis of
the microwave response of superconducting atomic point
contacts19,20. The relevance of the problem for a plain
superconductor is apparent in the case of superconduct-
ing parametric ampliﬁers21 and in the nonlinearity of ki-
netic inductance devices with microwave-readout14,22,23.
Additionally, the eﬀects of direct depairing at these fre-
quencies is also of interest for quantum optics on super-
conducting artiﬁcial quantum systems24,25. In summary,
there is an urgent need for a microscopic theory which
correctly describes the depairing of a conventional super-
conductor by microwave radiation.

We focus on the inﬂuence of high-frequency radia-
tion on a narrow and thin dirty s-wave superconduct-
ing strip using the well-established theory of nonequilib-
rium superconductivity11,26. The thickness and width
are assumed to be much less than the relevant penetra-
tion depth λ, allowing for a uniform current over the
cross-section. The strip is assumed to be long enough in
order to ignore the inﬂuence of the ends of the strip. We
consider the case of a relatively high frequency ω0 of the
microwave radiation:

α ≪ ω0 ≪ 2∆,

(1)

where the parameter α is the same as in the Eliashberg
theory12: α = e2DE2/ω2
0, with e the electron charge,
D the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, and E the amplitude of the
microwave ﬁeld. The left inequality of Eq.1, is known as
the condition for the quantum regime of absorption27–30,
and by analogy we call this regime of depairing the ’quan-
tum regime of depairing’. The right inequality of Eq.1,
points out that it is not possible to excite quasiparticles
directly. Hence, the depairing is only associated with the
reconstruction of the ground state of the superconductor
in the presence of a microwave ﬁeld.

We use the Keldysh-Usadel approach11,26,31 to deter-
mine the response of the superconductor. For details
we refer to the Supplementary Online Material (SOM)32.
Under the condition of Eq.1, the spatially homogeneous
dirty s-wave superconductor can be described by a closed
set of equations containing only the stationary compo-
nents of the Green’s functions and the order parame-

2

ter. The stationary components of the retarded Green’s
functions satisfy in the presence of monochromatic radi-
ation, modeled by a vector-potential A(t) = A cos(ω0t),
the equation

where

The second equation, Eq. 3, constitutes the formal diﬀer-
ence of depairing by an rf current from the case of depair-
ing by a dc current. In Eq. 2 and Eq. 3, GR
0 (E)
and F R
0 (E) are energy (E) dependent station-
ary normal and anomalous components of the supercon-
ducting matrix Green’s function ˆGR(E) in Nambu space.

In the case of depairing by a dc current1, the depairing

where f0 = f0(E) is the stationary component of the
distribution function, ωD the Debye frequency, and λep

In the case of
excitations by microwaves the distribution function is
symmetric in energy, f (E) = f (−E),
only the
longitudinal part fL of the distribution function arises:
sign(E)(1 − 2f (E)) = fL(E)11,26. Because of condition
1, direct excitations of quasiparticles by microwave ﬁeld
is impossible and, because we are focusing on the eﬀects
of ground state rebuilding, below we assume that there
are no quasiparticles excited.

i.e.

This set of equations (Eqs. (2) - (5)) has been solved
numerically. Fig. 1 shows the results for the density of
states, ℜGR
0 (E), for diﬀerent microwave intensities and
frequencies. The black dashed-dotted line in Fig. 1a cor-
responds to the pure BCS case without any depairing,
α = Γ = 0. The black solid line corresponds to depairing
by a dc current with the value of the depairing param-
eter Γ = 0.014∆0, with ∆0 the modulus of the order
parameter at zero temperature without any depairing.
The red curve corresponds to depairing by microwaves for
α = 0.0017∆0, with the photon-energies clearly visible.
To facilitate a quantitative estimate we express the ratio
Γ/∆0 as the ratio of the dc supercurrent j to the crit-
ical pair-breaking current jc with Γ/∆0 ∼= 0.11(j/jc)2.

ing to the photon energy ω0 (Fig 1). These photon-
steps are reminiscent of the photon-assisted tunneling
steps in the quasi-particle current of tunnel junctions ir-
radiated by a microwave signal28,29. In the present case
for a plain superconducting ﬁlm and frequencies, corre-
sponding to the right inequality in Eq. (1), the photon-
structures in the density of states can be interpreted
as a manifestation of Floquet states30 which inevitably
must exist in a superconductor in a microwave signal.
This would naturally arise in the displacement operator

ρq = Pn exp(iq · rn) introduced by Anderson, by re-

placing a time-independent q by q0 cos ωt. Here, this is
accomplished for a diﬀusive superconductor leading to
Eqs. 2 and 3.

Apart from its fundamental interest this theoretical
analysis is relevant for experiments on microwave kinetic
inductance detectors and parametric ampliﬁers based
on superconducting ﬁlms at milliKelvin temperatures,
where the electrodynamic response is dominated by the
superconducting condensate. Typically, the quantity
which is measured is the impedance or the complex con-
ductivity. The conductivity σ(ω) at frequency ω can be
derived from the general formula for the current density
in a diﬀusive superconductor in a straightforward way32:

with σN = 2e2N0D the conductivity of the wire in the
normal state, fL0− = fL0(E − ω0), and N0 the normal
metal density of states at the Fermi level. In deriving Eq.
(6) we ignore higher order terms leading to a modulation
of the conductivity at the doubled signal frequency. Fig.
2a,b shows the real part of conductivity ℜσ(ω), calcu-
lated from Eq. (6) with the same values of the depairing
parameters α, Γ and signal frequencies ω0 as used in Fig.
1b and c, for the densities of states. In Fig. 2a,b one ob-
serves, qualitatively, the same behavior in the real part of
the conductivity ℜσ(ω) as for the densities of states: the
microwave radiation leads to the appearance of anomalies
at ’photon points’ and an exponential-like tail at small
values of ω. In a recent experiment13 a superconducting
resonator of aluminium was measured to determine the
quality factor and the resonant frequency as a function
of applied microwave power.
In the interpretation the
absorption by quasi-particles was included, through the
well-known approach introduced by Eliashberg12. How-
ever, it was found that, at the lowest temperatures, it is
not possible to account for the shift in resonant frequency.
The observed shift was stronger than one would expect
on the basis of the shift in quality-factor, which is domi-
nated by the redistribution of quasi-particles over the en-
ergies. In the present theoretical analysis the new ingre-
dient is the modiﬁcation of the superconducting ground
state in the presence of microwaves. Therefore we fo-
cus on the change of resonant frequency with microwave
power, which is a measure of the change in kinetic induc-

The black dotted line in Panel a corresponds to the pure BCS
case without any depairing α = Γ = 0. The black solid line
corresponds to depairing by a dc current with the value of the
depairing parameter Γ = 0.014∆0. The red curve in Panel a
corresponds to rf depairing with the value of the parameter
α = 0.0017∆. The red, blue and magenta curves in the panels
b) and c) correspond to rf depairing with diﬀerent values of
and for diﬀerent frequencies: the red curve corresponds to
α = 0.0075∆0, ω0 = 0.125∆0, the blue curve corresponds
to α = 0.0075∆0, ω0 = 0.25∆0, and the magenta curve
corresponds to α = 0.0025∆0, ω0 = 0.125∆0. Panel c shows
on a logarithmic scale the presence of the low-lying states,
which are absent for zero or DC current, and steps at multiples
of ω0.

Similarly, for α: α/∆0 ∼= 0.014(j0/jc)2, with j0 the am-
plitude of the rf supercurrent. The DC current and RF
current curves in Fig. 1a corresponds to the same value
of j = 0.25jc. Fig. 1b presents a comparison between
densities of states for diﬀerent values of the depairing pa-
rameter α and diﬀerent frequencies, as indicated in the
ﬁgure.

As is evident from Fig. 1 the depairing due to the rf
signal (red, blue and magenta curves) is very diﬀerent
from the depairing due to a dc current (black curve) al-
though both smear the BCS singularity at E = ∆0 in a
similar way. One striking diﬀerence is that the density
of states, which corresponds to dc depairing, goes to zero
at some value of energy, whereas the densities of states,
which corresponds to rf depairing have exponential-like
tails at small energies (shown in Fig.1c).
In addition,
with rf depairing there are irregularities in the density
of states at equal distance from each other, correspond-

4

ical current to power. w and d are the width and the
thickness of the superconducting strip, respectively. This
conversion was done under the assumption of a uniform
distribution of the supercurrent across the strip.

In Fig. 2d we show, red line, the shift of the resonant
frequency as a function of microwave-power calculated
using Eq. (7). In the same ﬁgure the black squares cor-
respond to the experimental data of De Visser et al13,
determined for a resonant frequency of 5.3 GHz, well
above kT (64 mK) and well below ∆ (2.2 K). We in-
clude the experimental data as black squares, which agree
very well with the theoretical prediction, except at the
highest power. However, in the analysis of the measured
resonance curves the non-linearity in the kinetic induc-
tance was not taken into account. By including the non-
linearity of the kinetic inductance in the analysis of the
measured resonance curves following Swenson et al33 the
black data-points from13 were replaced by the red data
points (Fig. 2d), which agrees very well with the theoret-
ical prediction of Eq. 7 without using ﬁtting parameters.
These results have also implications for the density of
thermal quasiparticles for a given temperature. Obvi-
ously the reconﬁguration of the ground state in the pres-
ence of microwave power reduces the condensation energy
and therefore we expect for a given bath temperature a
rapid increase in their number. The number of excess
quasiparticles Nqp can be measured by further detailed
studies of their ﬂuctuations in a superconducting strip14.
We note that these other observables of the experiment13
(number of quasiparticles, recombination time, quality
factor), which more dominantly depend on f (E) as com-
pared to ∆f /f0, are still dominated by a redistribution of
the quasiparticles due to microwave absorption (Eliash-
berg). In contrast ∆f /f0 is a measure of the Cooper-pair
current.

A direct test of the present theory would be a measure-
ment of the density of states by tunneling. In such an
experiment it would be crucial to couple the microwave
radiation only to the superconducting strip and use a tun-
nel probe across which no electromagnetic ﬁeld would be
present. This requirement is analogous to the require-
ment to measure the distribution or the energy gap di-
rectly to test the theory of microwave-enhanced super-
conductivity. A solution for such an experiment has been
implemented by Horstman and Wolter34,35, which is very
feasible with the current level of technology. Instead of
the nonequilibrium distribution function one should ex-
tract the density of states, similarly to the experiment
for dc pairing carried out by Anthore et al1.

In summary, we have presented a theoretical analysis
of the quantum depairing eﬀect by a microwave ﬁeld for a
long thin strip of a diﬀusive s-wave superconductor. We
have demonstrated that the density of states loses a sharp
peak at the gap energy and acquires features at photon
points ∆ ± nω0. These features in the density of states
can be interpreted as a manifestation of Floquet states30
which inevitably exist in a superconductor, irradiated by
a microwave signal. Also we have shown that the density

indicated in the ﬁgure. (d) The observed shift of the resonant

power of the microwave radiation. Red line shows the shift
of the resonant frequency as a function of the internal power

respond to the data, which were taken by simply taking the
minimum of the resonance as the resonant frequency13. The
red squares correspond to the experimental data13, based on
an improved analysis by taking into account the nonlinearity
of the kinetic inductance.

tance, i.e. the Cooper-pair density, whereas the quality
factor is a measure of the losses due to the quasi-particles.
The kinetic inductance is given by the imaginary part of
the conductance, which is shown in Fig. 2c for a selec-
tion of α and ω0. Substitution of the calculated Green’s
functions into the imaginary part of Eq. (6) gives, for
low values of α (corresponding to the condition (1)), low
temperatures T ≪ Tc and low frequencies ω0 ≪ ∆, a
simple linear relation between α and the shift of kinetic
inductance δLk with respect to its value without rf ﬁeld
Lk:

δLk/Lk ∼= 4.85α/∆0.

(7)

This formula (7) allows us to perform a comparison
between the predictions of the theory and the re-
cent experiment13. To facilitate this comparison, we
rewrite Eq. 7 in the quantities which were measured
in the experiment and the parameters of the resonator:
∆f /f0 ∼= −2.42Pin/P0. Here, Pin is the (internal)
power of the microwave radiation in the resonator, P0 =
0w2d2/(ρ), with Z0 the impedance of the
2πZ0N0∆3
coplanar waveguide, f0 the resonant frequency, and ρ the
normal state resistivity of the superconducting resonator
(Al). P0 is a material parameter which relates the crit-

of states develops an exponential-like tail in the sub-gap
region. Both phenomena are in strong contrast to the
case of depairing by a dc current. We have demonstrated
that the predicted eﬀect is responsible for the shift of the
resonant frequency of Al superconducting resonator by
microwave power as observed in recent experiments13.

The dependence on spatial coordinates, if any, is assumed to be removed due to an appropriate gauge transformation.
Notations are standard, convolutions are

(a ◦ b) (t1, t2) = Z dt′a (t1, t′) b (t′, t2) ,

(A ◦ G) (t1, t2) = A (t1) G (t1, t2) .

Terms containing A, ˘∆ and ˘Σinel describe, correspondingly, the action of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, superconducting
pairing and scattering due to inelastic interactions.

Eq. (8) contains two equations with a diﬀerent physical meaning: an equation for the retarded Green’s function
ˆGR (and the hermitian conjugated equation for the advanced Green’s function ˆGA) which allows to ﬁnd spectral
quantities, and a kinetic equation which allows to ﬁnd the distribution function of quasiparticles.

Besides the Usadel equation the Green’s functions obey the normalization condition:

The retarded part of the Usadel equation (8) reads

One can see that it does not contain the distribution function explicitly. The latter aﬀects the solution of (10) only via
order parameter ˆ∆ which depends on the distribution function and on ˆGR via the self-consistency equation. Corre-
sponding normalization condition is ˆGR◦ ˆGR = ˆ1δ (t1 − t2). In the following evaluations, superscript R will be omitted.

Rewriting the Usadel equation for discrete real frequencies.
For evaluation, it is useful to transit from the two-temporal representation for Green’s functions to the two-energy

representation, which is introduced via Fourier transformation

a (E, E − ω) = Z dt1dt2 exp (iEt1 − i (E − ω) t2) a (t1, t2) .

In this representation, convolutions read:

7

(a ◦ b) (E, E − ω) = Z dω′

2π

a (E, E − ω′) b (E − ω′, E − ω) ,

(A ◦ G) (E, E − ω) = Z dω′

2π

A (ω′) G (E − ω′, E − ω) ,

(G ◦ A) (E, E − ω) = Z dω′

2π

G (E, E − ω′) A (ω − ω′) ≡ Z dω′

2π

G (E, E − ω + ω′) A (ω′) ,

Here A(ω) is the Fourier transform of A(t),

∂t1 → −iE, ∂t2 → i (E − ω) .

A (ω) = Z dt exp (iωt) A (t) .

First we consider terms in the retarded Usadel equation that contain A. For compactness, some coeﬃcients will be
omitted while evaluating and restored later, when required. Substituting the expressions for convolutions and treating

them as (cid:16)A ◦ ˆG ◦ A ◦ ˆG(cid:17) = (cid:16)A ◦ ˆG(cid:17) ◦(cid:16)A ◦ ˆG(cid:17) etc., one can see that they are

To make the physical meaning more explicit, one can transit to frequency-energy representation using the rule

G (E, E − ω) = Gω (E − ω/2) ,

where the argument in brackets has a meaning of energy and the argument in subscript has a meaning of frequency,
which is the Fourier-conjugate of time. (Note that the energy is a half-sum of “front” and “rear” energies and the
frequency is their diﬀerence).

Shifting the energy argument by +ω/2, one rewrites the above-written terms in frequency-energy representation as

The case of monochromatic ﬁeld.
Till the moment, the evaluations were simply rewriting of initial expressions from the retarded Usadel equations
in useful representations. Now let us use the assumption that the ﬁeld is monochromatic with a frequency ω0:
A (ω) = 2πδ (ω − ω0) A+ + 2πδ (ω + ω0) A−. From the periodicity of the ﬁeld, it follows that Green’s functions and
other frequency-dependent quantities can be expanded in harmonics of ω0:

The terms with A now become

where indexes s1,2 runs over ±1 and Ek ≡ E + kω0/2.

One sees that the equation for harmonics is a set of linked equations at every n. There also exists an equal
number of equations emerging from the normalization condition ˆG ◦ ˆG = ˆδ (t1 − t2), whose form in frequency-energy
representation is

In scalar form, the Usadel equation and normalization condition are

Green’s functions at nonzero frequencies emerge only if the ﬁeld is nonzero and tend to 0 continuously with the
decrease of the ﬁeld, so one can expand Gn by powers of A. From the ”conservation of frequency” (frequencies at
the left- and right-hand sides of all equalities should be equal), it follows that the main term in the series for Gn is
at least An. On the other hand, because A is a vector and G a scalar, and there is no other vector except A in the
problem, series for G can contain only even powers of A. So it is obvious that Gn with odd n vanish. Thus one should
keep only terms with even indexes of the Green’s functions in the above-written expressions.

Equations (11) and (12) or (13) and (14), being supplemented by the self-consistency equation for ˆ∆, form a
complete set describing the problem. The set is redundant: upper and lower equations in (13) and (14) contain
identical information (below this will be demonstrated explicitly for a particular case), expect the case n = 0 when
left-hand sides of upper equation (13) and lower equation (14) are identically zeros.

§2. Closed Usadel equation for time-averaged Green functions.
To obtain a closed equation for the harmonic at zero frequency, one can consider the amplitude of the vector-

potential A as a small parameter and, keeping only terms not greater than A2, obtain for n = 0

(cid:16)A ◦ ˆG ◦ A ◦ ˆG(cid:17)0

(cid:16) ˆG ◦ A ◦ ˆG ◦ A(cid:17)0

(E) ≈ A+ ˆG0 (E−2) A− ˆG0 (E) + A− ˆG0 (E+2) A+ ˆG0 (E) ,

(E) ≈ ˆG0 (E) A+ ˆG0 (E−2) A− + ˆG0 (E) A− ˆG0 (E+2) A+,

where ˆG0 ≡ ˆG0 (E), ˆG0± ≡ ˆG0 (E±2) = ˆG0 (E ± ω0) and α ≡ e2DA+A−, and the normalization condition

ˆG2

0 = ˆ1.

(15)

(16)

One can see that the equations are closed with respect to G0. This is due to the fact that, for n = 0, all the terms
containing Gm6=0, both in the Usadel equation (11) and in the normalization condition (12), are at least of 4-th order
in A.

In scalar form, the equations can be obtained by substituting

ˆG0 = (cid:18) G0

These are the equations we work with in the main text.

Validity criterion of closed equations for the zero-frequency harmonic.
To use closed equations for zero-frequency harmonic ˆG0, one should ﬁnd a criterion of smallness of A. A natural
way to do this is to ﬁnd ˆG2 keeping only ∝ A0 and ∝ A2 terms in (11) and (12) and then see at which A the condition
ˆG2 ≪ ˆG0 holds. To ﬁnd ˆG2, one should solve the Usadel equation at n = 2, which with accuracy up to terms ∝ A2 is:

α+(cid:16)ˆτ3 ˆG0 ˆτ3 ˆG0− − ˆG0+ ˆτ3 ˆG0 ˆτ3(cid:17) − iEhˆτ3, ˆG2i − iω0nˆτ3, ˆG2o − ih ˆ∆0, ˆG2i − i(cid:16) ˆ∆2 ˆG0− − ˆG0+ ˆ∆2(cid:17) = 0,

(19)

10

where ˆG0 is written in zero’th order accuracy in A, i.e. it is a solution of the Usadel equation (15) with α = 0, and
α+ ≡ e2DA2
+ (it can diﬀer from α only by a phase factor). In scalar form, this results in two linear equations with
respect to G2, F2 ( ˆG2 = G2 ˆτ3 + F2iˆτ2):

−2iω0G2 = −α+ (G0 (G0− − G0+) + F0 (F0− − F0+)) + i∆2 (F0− − F0+) ,

−2iEF2 − 2i∆0G2 = −α+ (G0 (F0− + F0+) + F0 (G0− + G0+)) + i∆2 (G0− + G0+) .

(20)

The ﬁrst equation is the component of matrix equation (19) proportional to ˆ1 and the second one is that proportional
to ˆτ3. (Two other components are identically zero). The normalization condition for n = 2 with terms up to ∝ A2
reads

(largest neglected terms are ∝ A6) or in a scalar form

ˆG2 ˆG0− + ˆG0+ ˆG2 = 0,

(G0− + G0+) G2 − (F0− + F0+) F2 = 0,
(F0− − F0+) G2 − (G0− − G0+) F2 = 0.

(21)

The determinant of the system is zero as one can prove using the normalization condition for n = 0 (18), so the
equations are identical. The two equations (20) are also identical: dividing the second of them on the ﬁrst, using
normalization condition (21), and rearranging terms, one obtains the equality

E (F0− − F0+) + ∆0 (G0− + G0+) − ω0 (F0− + F0+) = 0

which is nothing except the diﬀerence of two Usadel equation for zero frequency (in zero’th order in A), written for
energies E ± ω0. Thus one can choose, for instance, ﬁrsts of the equations (20) and (21) and solve the obtained system
to ﬁnd G2 and F2. The solution is

G2 = −α+(G0(G0−−G0+)+F0(F0−−F0+))+i∆2(F0−−F0+)

−2iω0
F2 = G0−+G0+
F0−+F0+

G2.

,

(22)

To ﬁnd when the condition of smallness of G2 is fulﬁlled, note that diﬀerences G0− − G0+, F0− − F0+ are of order

unity and to have G2, F2 ≪ G0, F0, one requires

α ≪ ω0.

§3. Expressions for some observable quantities.
Zero’th order harmonics Green’s functions G0, F0 have the sense of time-averaged Green’s functions. Time-averaged
values of spectral quantities which are linear in the Green’s functions, can be calculated simply by replacing G, F to
G0, F0 in corresponding formulas. For instance, the time-averaged density of states is N (E) = N0ℜG0.

For the (linear) conductivity at frequency ω, one obtains

σ(ω) =
