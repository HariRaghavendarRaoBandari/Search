Abstract

An alternative stochastic model for the fundamental diagram of traﬃc ﬂow with minimal number of parameters is proposed. The
key features of the model lie in its “catastrophic” potential function as well as in its stochastic nature, which makes it possible to
describe the main features of the ﬂow-concentration relation. In particular, the inverse-λ shape as well as the wide scattering of
congested traﬃc data are both reproduced. In our model, the scattering of the data is attributed to the noise terms introduced in
the stochastic diﬀerential equations. The inverse-λ shape and the associated sudden jump of physical quantities arise, on the other
hand, due to the existence of two simultaneous stable traﬃc ﬂow states and/or to the eﬀect of stochastic noises on the stability of
the system. The model parameters are calibrated and compared qualitatively with the data.

1. Introduction

Owing to its implication to transport theory and hydrodynamics, traﬃc ﬂow modeling has long
attracted the attention of physicists (For reviews, see for example (Treiber and Kesting, 2012;
Kerner, 2009; Prigogine and Herman, 1971; Pedersen and et.al., 2011; Hoogendoorn and Bovy,
2001; Maerivoet and Moor, 2005)). In macroscopic models (Lighthill and Whitham, 1955; Edie,

1960; Greenberg, 1959; Kerner and Konhauser, 1993; Karlsen, 1995; Helbing, 1995; Kerner and Konhauser
1994; Helbing, 1996; Zhang, 2001), the system is treated as a continuous ﬂuid and its individ-
ual constituent parts are not distinguished. Therefore, many methods of the conventional hy-
drodynamics thus can be directly borrowed into the investigation of traﬃc ﬂow. The micro-
scopic approach, on the other hand, tackles the space-time behavior of each individual vehicle
as well as their interactions at the most detailed level. Owing to its mathematical complex-
ity, approximations are usually introduced in order to obtain asymptotic solutions or to make
the problem less computationally expensive. The car-following (Pipes, 1953; Gazis et al., 1959;
Alvarez and Casado, 1990; A.K. and Santiago, 1990; Zhang and Kim, 2005; Mu and Yamamoto,
2013; Chen et al., 2012; Li and Ouyang, 2011), optimal velocity (Bando et al., 1995; Komatsu and ichi Sasa
1995; Treiber et al., 2000) and the cellular automaton models (Nagel and Schreckenberg, 1992a;
Eisenblatter et al., 1998; Rickert et al., 1996; Nagel and Schreckenberg, 1992b; Schadschneider and Schreck
1993) can be viewed as microscopic approaches.
In some particular cases (Greenberg, 1959;
Gazis et al., 1959), these approaches were shown to be equivalent in reproducing the fundamental
diagram of traﬃc ﬂow. A mesoscopic model (Prigogine and Andrews, 1960; Prigogine and Herman,
1971; Paveri-Fontana, 1975; Nelson, 1995) lies between the microscopic and the macroscopic ap-
proaches. The model does not attempt to distinguish nor trace individual vehicles. Instead, it treats
traﬃc ﬂow in terms of vehicle distribution densities as continuous functions of time, spatial coor-
dinates and velocities. Most mesoscopic models are derived from kinetic theory. In the same way
as hydrodynamics can be obtained through the Boltzmann equation (Grad, 1949; Chapman et al.,
1991; Groot, 1980), the mesoscopic model for traﬃc ﬂow has also been used to obtain the corre-
sponding macroscopic equations (Helbing, 1995, 1996). These eﬀorts thus provide a sound theo-
retical foundation for macroscopic models besides heuristic arguments and lax analogies between
traﬃc ﬂow and ordinary ﬂuids.

One important empirical measurement is the so called “fundamental diagram” of traﬃc ﬂow.
It is plotted in terms of vehicle ﬂow q as a function of vehicle density k: Empirical observa-
tions which have been accumulated on highways in diﬀerent countries for nearly 8 decades (see
for instance ref.(Pedersen and et.al., 2011; Kerner and Rehborn, 1996; Daganzo, 2002; Cassidy,
1998b)) indicate the following characteristics: (1) Usually the ﬂow-concentration curve is divided
into two diﬀerent regions of lower and higher vehicle density respectively, which correspond to
“free” and “congested” ﬂow. (2) The maximum of the ﬂow occurs at the junction between free
and congested region, it features an inverse-λ shape (Edie, 1961; Drake and Schofer, 1967; Payne,
1984; Hall et al., 1992) accompanying with capacity drop (Banks, 1990, 1991; Hall, 1991). (3)
Congested ﬂow in general presents a broader scattering of the data points on the ﬂow-concentration
plane, in comparison to that of the free ﬂow. In other word, the free ﬂow and congested ﬂow
are understood as two distinct phases (or traﬃc states), the variance of ﬂow for free traﬃc ﬂow
is relatively small, it increases as the vehicle density increases, until the phase transition takes
place, where the system becomes unstable or chaotic indicating the onset of traﬃc congestion. (4)
However, If one divides the empirically observed data into stationary and non-stationary traﬃc
conditions, it is shown (Cassidy, 1998a; Munoz, 2003; Cassidy and Mauch, 2001) that the result-
ing fundamental diagram is continuous and scatter-free when one is only interested in the average
values of sustained periods of nearly stationary traﬃc conditions. Concerning the last point, some

intriguing details are worth mentioning. The above scatterplot in question describes the average
properties of prolonged periods (∼ 10 min) of near-stationary traﬃc states. It exhibits a well-
deﬁned relation between ﬂow and concentration, which does not show evidence of discontinuities.
In fact, the scatterplot obtained from the near-stationary data is shown to be very diﬀerent from
that obtained by simply collecting consecutive time intervals of ﬁxed duration. The latter includes
the information of non-stationary states, which mostly capture the scattering feature of the data
points and usually fall beneath the former curve. In particular, if one plots the ﬂow and concen-
tration data measured over smaller aggregation interval (∼ 2 min), both the discontinuity and the
scattering nature of the data reappear. While the discontinuity measures the diﬀerence between
free and congested traﬃc states, the observed scatter is associated to the non-stationary transitions
between the two traﬃc states. Therefore, a part of the observed complexity in the fundamental
diagram could be understood as a result of mixing (averaging) traﬃc data from stationary and
non-stationary traﬃc conditions. In this sense, it seems that the observed inverse-λ shape and dis-
continuity in the fundamental diagram is not a characteristic of traﬃc, but rather a characteristic
of traﬃc data aggregation.

On the other hand, even under stationary traﬃc conditions, certain degree of residual scatter al-
ways persists. They are, for the most part, statistical in nature. The cause of such uncertainty can be
attributed to heterogeneous drivers (Windover and J., 2001) and lane changes (Laval and Daganzo,
2006) among others. Also, when the fundamental diagram is obtained by using smaller aggrega-
tion interval, it may carry the information on the intrinsically non-stationary state or the dynamics
of transitions between diﬀerent traﬃc states. These non-stationary states can be either determin-
istic or stochastic. In literature, many parsimonious models were developed in their eﬀorts to un-
derstand the underlying dynamics. These traﬃc conditions are understood to be closely connected
to the instability of the equation of motion (Kerner and Konhauser, 1993; Bando et al., 1995;
Ben-Naim et al., 1994; Komatsu and ichi Sasa, 1995; Treiber et al., 2000), or to phase transitions
(bifurcations) in the system (Arnold, 1994; Hall, 1987; Kerner, 2009; Eisenblatter et al., 1998).
The corresponding scatter of the data can be either attributed to the (transient) temporal evolution
of the dynamical system (such as stop-and-go wave (Kerner and Konhauser, 1993, 1994; Lee et al.,
1998, 1999; Treiber et al., 1999; Helbing et al., 1999; Daganzo et al., 1999)), or to the “synchro-
nized ﬂow” deﬁned in the three phase traﬃc theory (Kerner, 2004a; Kerner and Klenov, 2006).
From an empirical viewpoint, the uncertainties observed in the data can be always expressed
in terms of the variance of the fundamental diagram, which has become an intriguing topic in
the recent years (Castillo and Benitez, 1995; Cassidy, 1998b; Treiber and Helbing, 2003; Li et al.,
2012; Kerner, 2004b; Nelson and Sopasakis, 1998). To study such uncertainties, methodologies
involving stochastic modeling have aroused much attention, either from macroscopic viewpoint
(Boel and Mihaylova, 2006; Jabari and Liu, 2012; Sumalee et al., 2011; Wang and Papageorgiou,
2005), from microscopic models (Wagner, 2011; Huang et al., 2001; Dailey and Cathey, 2002;
Nagel and Schreckenberg, 1992a; Schadschneider and Schreckenberg, 1993; Sopasakis and Katsoulakis,
2006) or from phenomenological approaches (Wang et al., 2006; Ngoduy, 2011; Brilon et al.,
2005).

The present work involves an attempt to study the uncertainties in the fundamental diagram
from the viewpoint of stochastic noises. It is also intended to address the discontinuous feature

4

of the fundamental diagram. We make use of the stochastic diﬀerential equations (SDE) to model
the system with stochastic noises. Our claim is that the sudden jump can be either explained by
the existence of two simultaneously local stable stationary solutions implied by the non-linear
nature of the model, or can be understood in terms of the modiﬁed stability of the system due
to the stochastic noises. In what follows, we ﬁrstly present two simpliﬁed deterministic models
characterized by the “fold” and “cusp” catastrophe potential functions. Both of the two models
lead to two diﬀerent traﬃc phases, and the latter one is accompanied with the inverse-λ shape
at the transition point. Secondly, the stochastic nature is implemented to the “fold” catastrophe
model. We investigate the variance of the ﬂow and study numerically the stability of the solutions
of the SDE, and show how the appearance of the discontinuity of the fundamental diagram is
again obtained. Our model is then compared qualitatively to the data from I-80 freeway collected
under the NGSIM program; it is shown that both the fundamental diagram and its variance are
reasonably reproduced. Conclusion remarks and perspectives are given by the end of the paper.

2. Mesoscopic catastrophe models

2.1. A “fold catastrophe” model

In this section, we will ﬁrst introduce a simple non-linear mesoscopic model with minimal
number of parameters which provides analytic solution for two traﬃc states, namely, free ﬂow
state and congested ﬂow state. We also show this model is equivalent to a fold catastrophe model.
In a recent study (Siqueira et al., 2016), a mesoscopic traﬃc model was proposed to study the
fundamental diagram and its uncertainties. However, for the most part, in that work one only
considers linear cases so that stationary solutions must also be globally stable in order to have
physical interpretations. It is widely known that traﬃc congestion is caused by the instability of
the system; therefore it is essential to generalize the model into the non-linear domain. Following
our recent studies (Siqueira et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2015), let us consider a section of one-lane
highway of length L and with two speed states v1 < v2. Also one assumes that the total vehicle
number N is conserved. The equation of motion (EoM) of the model is essentially a simpliﬁed
transport equation given by

dn1
dt
dn2
dt

= −c1n1 + c2n1n2
1
= −c2n2n1

Nmax − N

Nmax − N
+ c1n1

(1)

where ni (i = 1, 2) is the occupation number of corresponding velocity state vi and Nmax is maximal
congestion number owing to ﬁnite vehicle size. So kmax = Nmax/L is the corresponding maximal
vehicle density leading to complete congestion. The physical contents of the equation and of
the coeﬃcients are the following. The transition rate of n1 is determined by the r.h.s. of the
equation consisting of a loss term and a gain term. The loss term c1n1 is simply proportional to
the occupation number since cautious slow drivers leave this state at a ﬁx rate. In addition of
being proportional to n2, the gain term must be also proportional to n1, since slow drivers force
the fast ones to slow down to their velocities. The extra constant factor
Nmax−N takes the total

congestion into account as explained below. It is easy to show that Eq.(1) guarantees the total
vehicle conservation N = n1 + n2 and hence there is only one degree of freedom. Therefore one
may simply consider the following equation in terms of n1.

dn1
dt ≡ f (n1) = −c1n1 + c2n1

N − n1
Nmax − N

Its stationary solution n∗ is given by setting the r.h.s. of the above equation to zero:

− c1n1 + c2n1

and one obtains

N − n1
Nmax − N

n∗f = 0

or

n∗g = N −

These solutions are stable against small deviations if the stability criterion (Qian et al., 2015)

where kc = Nc/L and qc = kcv2. The fundamental diagram in this case is a continuous curve made
up of two straight lines with inclinations v2 and v1 − c1
(v2 − v1). A schematic fundamental diagram
for v1 = 0.0 is shown in the left panel of Fig.1. One sees that the ﬂow arises linearly in the free
ﬂow phase N < Nc and hits its peak at N = Nc, then system switches to the second stationary
solution while the ﬂow drops linearly until it vanishes while attaining k = kmax. Let it be noted that
these solutions are exact.

Nc < N ≤ Nmax

It is not diﬃcult to show that the above simple model is equivalent to a “fold catastrophe” model,
with the minima of its potential function being the same as the roots of Eq.(3). The fold potential
function is a third order polynomial:

were adopted v1 = 0, v2 = c1 = Nmax = 1, c2 = 3. Left: The fundamental diagram without stochastic noises. Right:
The corresponding fundamental diagram when stochastic noises are considered.

2.2. A “cusp catastrophe” model

Though the above model is simple enough and shows some important characteristics of traﬃc
ﬂow. It does not intrinsically contain coexistence of local stable stationary solutions owing to its
simplicity. As a result, this model does not display the inverse-λ shape in the fundamental diagram.
As we are about to show in the following, that the ﬂow-concentration realtion may possess such
feature if one replaces c1 in the loss term in (1) by

c′1(n1) =

c1

a + n1

.

(11)

Observe that c′1 increases much more rapidly for low values of n1(n1 ≪ a) than for high ones (n1 ≫
a), in fact it tends to saturate for such values which renders a loss term practically independent of
n1. In this case the number of fast or of slow drivers does not aﬀect the rate at which slow drivers
accelerate and one can indeed associate this behavior to a free ﬂow regime. We claim that this
loss term c′1 reﬂects the reluctance of the cautious slow drivers to accelerate: since it changes
signiﬁcantly from the constant rate only for low values of n1, that is, when the number of n2 of
fast drivers is high enough to convince the slow ones to change their velocity. Mathematically
speaking, it turns our model into a third order non-linear one.

Now the stationary solutions are given by the roots of

f (n∗) =

c1n∗
a + n∗ − c2n∗(N − n∗) = 0

the stability criterion is

c1a

+ c2(N − 2c2n∗) < 0.

One root is again n∗f = 0 and it is stable if

h(n) = −n3 + (1 − x)n2 + (x − λ2)n = 0

(17)
where λ = √b/N. For N′ < N < ¯N which is equivalent to √x < λ < (1 + x)/2, the null solution
is stable, that is, h′(0) < 0 and the non-null solutions are positive. So h(n) has the shape shown
in Fig.2.a. We are led to conclude that n∗+ is stable, since h′(n∗+/N) is necessarily negative. On the
other hand, for N > ¯N > N′(λ < √x < (1 + x)/2), the null solution is unstable and n∗
is negative,
−
which renders n∗+ stable, as can be seen in Fig.2.b

From these considerations one can conclude that the ﬂux q increases linearly with k as

q = kv2

(18)
provided N < ¯N. As N increases past ¯N the null solution is no more stable and q suﬀers a sudden
jump since for N > ¯N the ﬂux is given by

Fig. 3. Schematic fundamental diagram from the The third order non-linear model where trivial parametrization were
adopted. The results are obtained by using v1 = 0,v2 = 1,x = 1/16 and b = 0.25.

On the other hand, as N decreases from large values of N (N > ¯N), the ﬂux is given by (19) as
long as N > N′. At N = N′ q jumps to kv2. It is worth noticing that the jumps occurs for diﬀerent
values of N as long as x < 1 (N < a), since ¯N = N′ and there is no discontinuity in the q behavior
for x = 1. This behavior is the direct cause of the sudden jump of ﬂow capacity and inverse-
“lambda” shape at the transition point in the fundamental diagram, the coexistence of locally
stable stationary states also potentially leads to the phenomenon of hysteresis. The corresponding
fundamental diagram is depicted in the right panel of Fig.3. One can see that the parameter x (or a)
is crucial for our analysis since it dictates both the extent of the gaps and the distance between N′
and ¯N. We note that the points on the calculated fundamental diagrams correspond to stationary
states.

We close this section by mentioning that the above third order non-linear approach is equivalent
to the “cusp catastrophe” model, with the minima of the potential function of the model corre-
sponding to the roots of the three-folded function h(n) deﬁned in Eq.(17). It is straightforward to
show that locally stable physical states are the minima of the following potential function, which
is a fourth order polynomial

3. A stochastic “fold catastrophe” model

Up to this point, we have not considered the eﬀect of stochastic transition terms. The physical
content of these transitions is closely related to the stochastic nature of traﬃc system and therefore
may partly provide a mathematical implementation for the “scattering nature” of fundamental
diagram. In addition, as we are about to show in this section, the introduction of stochastic noises
may modify the stability of stationary solution of the “fold catastrophe” model. As a result, the
fundamental diagram is aﬀected. It becomes discontinuous and an inverse-λ shape appears near
the maximum of the ﬂow. In our approach, the stochastic noises are studied by making use of

SDE. Let us introduce stochastic noises into the above “fold catastrophe” model as following

dn1 = −c1n1 + c2n1n2
dn2 = −c2n2n1
Nmax − N

Nmax − N! dt − √c1n1dB1 + r c2n1n2

where B1 and B2 are independent Brownian motions and Itˆo formulas (Oksendal, 2010) are as-
sumed. The square roots imply that the noises have the same order of magnitude as those of
deterministic transitions (Oksendal, 2010; Allen, 2007; Bulut and Allen, 2013).

Fig. 4. Schematic variance of the fundamental diagram of the “fold catastrophe” model. In the calculation, one uses
the same trivial parameters in Fig.1 v1 = 0, v2 = c1 = Nmax = L = 1, c2 = 3. In the left panel, the curves show the
variances determined by Eq.(28); in the right panel, stochastic stability of the solutions are considered, the congested
ﬂow state shrinks while free ﬂow state extends to ks. The location of ks is illustrative.

To evaluate the expected value, it is mathematically rigorous to ignore the stochastic transition
terms, when the coeﬃcient of the stochastic transition term si j √n j ∈ V (see Theorem 3.2.1 of
(Oksendal, 2010), this is satisﬁed for most well behaved functions). One is then left to determine
whether these stationary solutions are indeed stochastically stable. However, to the best of our
knowledge, to obtain any analytic result on the stability of SDE is not an easy task (Arnold et al.,
1983; Kwiecinska, 1999; Mao, 1999; Scheutzow, 1993).
In Appedix I, we show analytically
that for N < Nc, the free ﬂow solution in Eq.(9) for deterministic equation (Eq.(1)) is indeed
stable for the corresponding SDE (Eq.(21)). For other value of N, numerical studies is carried
out to determine the stability of the stable solutions. The results are presented in Appendix II.
It turns out that the SDE possesses diﬀerent stability properties comparing to the corresponding
deterministic EoM. It is found that the free ﬂow solution is stochastically stable within the range
0 < N < Ns where the value Ns is numerically found to be bigger than Nc. When N ≥ Ns,
the system dwells around a quasi-stationary solution Grasman and van Herwaarden (1999) for a
very long period until it eventually evolves to the absorbing boundary. Therefore, we interpret the
region Ns < N < Nmax in our model as the congested ﬂow.

For stable solution, one calculates the variance of expected value following the standard proce-

We note that the appearance of Ns breaks the continuity of the fundamental diagram. The free
ﬂow solution does not stops at Nc (where it intersects with the congested ﬂow solution at point
“A” in the left panel of Fig.1) but continues until Ns. Correspondingly, the congested ﬂow solution
appears as a quasi-stationary solution only when the concentrations is bigger than Ns, which causes
a gap, ∆q = q f ree(Ns) − qcongested(Ns), at Ns, as can be inferred from Eq.(9).
In Fig.4, we present the schematic results of the variation of the fundamental diagram by using
the same parameters as those in Fig.1. It is shown that the variance was zero in the free ﬂow phase
due to fact that E[n1] = 0. Then the variance increases when the system enters congested phase (as

Fig. 5. Fit of the model together with the data from I-80 freeway collected under the NGSIM program. The blue
lines are the ﬁt for the average ﬂow while the dotted red lines enclose its standard deviation. The scatterplot is
from ref.(Jin, 2010). The ﬁt was obtained by using the following parameters: kmax = 850, v1 = 0.37, v2 = 6, L =
10.0, c1/c2 = 0.35. The left panel shows the ﬁt for the deterministic “fold catastrophe” model, the right panel presents

an unstable solution at ﬁrst when Nc < N < Ns). It reaches the maximum and eventually decreases
to zero when the complete congestion occurs, as seen from Eq.(28). A qualitative comparison
to the data is shown in Fig.5. As shown in the left panel of Fig.5, for the deterministic “fold
catastrophe” model, the maximum of the ﬂow occurs at N = Nc which corresponds to the tip of
the triangle of the left panel of Fig.5. In this case, the average of the ﬂow is reasonably described by
the model. The introduction of the stochastic version of the model helps to describe the scattering
feature of the data, as presented in the right panel of Fig.4.
It is observed that the calculated
variance is not able to reproduce the scattering of the data close to the transition region. We
understand this is due to the interplay between two states (namely, homogeneous free ﬂow and
homogeneous congested ﬂow, which are both locally stable states in the deterministic version
of the model) of the EoM Eq.(1) and the stochastic noise which triggers the transitions among
them. Since our model does not explicitly deal with such temporal evolution, it lies beyond our
present scope. On the other hand, one observes that the standard deviation of the data at the
congested phase is well described by the model, as it ﬁrst increases than decreases. Moreover,
another important feature of the model is worth discussing. As shown numerically in Appendix
II, stochastic transitions do modify the stability of the corresponding deterministic EoM Eq.(1).
It is found that the free ﬂow state stretches beyond the point of Nc, meanwhile the homogeneous
congested ﬂow phase shrinks and starts only at N = Ns > Nc. A small vertical gap consequently
appears below the maximum of the ﬂow, and therefore an inverse-λ shape is formed in the right
plot of Fig.5. Interestingly enough, we want to emphasize that the above inverse-λ shape would not
appear at all, if one only considers stationary traﬃc states. This is because that the stationary traﬃc
state implies the situation where the strength of the stochastic noises is much suppressed; or in the
extreme condition, one considers that the model reduces to its deterministic version. In the latter
case, the stable free ﬂow occurs only within the range N < Nc, and the corresponding fundamental
diagram restores to be continuous as shown in the left panel of Fig.5. As the authors understand,
this feature of the model is in good agreement of the observed characteristic of the fundamental
diagram, and in particular, it is in consistent with the feature (4) when the measurements are done
for stationary traﬃc states without much ﬂuctuation.

To summarize, in this work we investigate two versions of non-linear transport models for the
traﬃc ﬂow as well as the eﬀect of stochastic transition terms. The two models are closely con-
nected to the well-known “catastrophe model” of traﬃc ﬂow. For both approaches, a thorough

12

W.-L. Qian et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 00 (2017) 000–000

discussion of their stability properties, especially in the deterministic case, is facilitated by the
models’ simplicity. In our approach, the inverse-λ shape and the associated sudden jump of phys-
ical quantities are understood to be associated to the existence of two simultaneous stable traﬃc
ﬂow states and/or to the eﬀect of stochastic transition terms on the stability of the model. In the
latter case, the capacity drop is dynamic and it depends on the strength of the stochastic noise
terms. The scattering feature of the data is attributed to the noise terms and agrees qualitatively
with the data.

4. Appendix I: stability of the SDE for N < Nc

Here we show that the free ﬂow solution x(0, t) ≡ n1(0, t) = 0 of the Eq.(1) is stochastically
stable (Deﬁnition 2.1) by using Theorem 2.2 of Chapter 4 of the reference (Mao, 2007). The
outline of the proof is as follows. To show that the solution x(t) ≡ 0 is stable for a stochastic
equation

dx(t) = f (x(t), t)dt + g(x(t), t)dB

one needs to ﬁnd a positive-deﬁnite function V(x, t) ∈ C2,1(S h × [t0, ∞); R+) such that LV(x, t) ≤ 0.
Here V(x, t) corresponds to the Lyapunov function of an ordinary diﬀerential equation, which
measures the “distance” of a small perturbation from the equilibrium solution; and

L =

2Xi, j

[g(x, t)gT (x, t)]i, j

is a diﬀerential operator. LV(x, t) bears the interpretation of time derivative of the distance V.
Besides, for the theorem to be valid, one needs f (0, t) = g(0, t) = 0, which is readily to be satisﬁed
by the equation of n1

dn1 = −c1n1 + c2n1(N − n1)

Nmax − N! dt − √c1n1dB1 + rc2n1(N − n1)
Nmax − N

(29)

Now let us take V(x, t) = x. It is straightforward to show that V is indeed positive deﬁnite and

LV(x, t) = −c1x + c2x(N − x)

Nmax − N

It is straightforward to show that the condition LV ≤ 0 implies N < Nc, with Nc deﬁned in Eq.(7).
5. Appendix II: numerical study of the stability of the SDE

In this Appendix, we numerically study the stability of the expected value as well as the variance
of the free ﬂow and congested ﬂow solutions of Eq.(1) according to their deﬁnitions. The equation
for free ﬂow is Eq.(29). One may also write down the equation for the congested ﬂow

d ˜n1 = c1 ˜n1 − c2 ˜n1(N + ˜n1)

Nmax − N! dt − qc1(˜n1 + n∗g)dB1 + sc2(˜n1 + n∗g)(N − (˜n1 − n∗g))

13

where one makes use of n1 → ˜n1 = n1 − n∗g, such that ˜n1 = 0 corresponds to the congested ﬂow
solution and the stochastic stablity can be veriﬁed according to its deﬁnition. We note that the
above equation is not symmetric in comparison to Eq.(29), since the former has ˜f (0, t) = 0 and
˜g(0, t) , 0. The parameter space of the system is one-dimensional, therefore it is suﬃcient to
present the numerical results of the evolution of free ﬂow as shown in Fig.6 below.

Fig. 6. Numerical study of the stability of the SDE for the free ﬂow and the congested ﬂow. The calculations are carried
out using the same parameters of the ﬁt shown in Fig.5, one has Nc = 2204. The plots show the temporal evolution of
small perturbations (n1(0) = 100) for diﬀerent road concentrations k = N/L. Each plot illustrates (in diﬀerent colors)
several of many numerical simulations carried out. Top left: temporal evolution for small perturbations for the free
ﬂow state with N = 1000 < Nc; Top right: the same as the top left plot but with N = Nc; Bottom left: the same as
the top left plot but with Nc < N = 2214 < Ns = 2360, all the three plots show that numerically n1(t → +∞) = 0,
therefore the solution is stochastically stable as long as N < Ns; Bottom right: the same as the top left plot but with
N = 5204 > Ns, it shows that the system evolves to a quasi-stationary state as n1 → n∗g.

Fig.6 shows that both the expected value and variance of the free ﬂow is stochastically stable
(approaches zero) when N < Nc as proven in Appendix I. However, the range of stable free ﬂow
actually reaches beyond Nc. In fact, free ﬂow is stable when N < Ns with Ns > Nc. When N > Ns,
the system evolves towards the equilibrium n1 = n∗g (Eq.(5)) and stay in its neighborhood for a
very long period of time before it eventually evolves to the absorbing boundary. It is noted that

14

W.-L. Qian et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 00 (2017) 000–000

such temporal evolution is stochastic in nature and therefore not periodic, it is known as a quasi-
stationary solution according to Grasman and van Herwaarden (1999). Since n∗g corresponds to
the congested ﬂow state in the deterministic “fold catastrophe” model, we therefore identify this
solution as the congested ﬂow state. Numerically one ﬁnds ks = kc + 15.5 ± 0.5.
