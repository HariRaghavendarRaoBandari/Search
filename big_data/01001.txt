The medium-long term frequency stability of the integrating sphere cold atom clock was improved.
During the clock operation, Rb atoms were cooled and manipulated using cooling light diﬀusely
reﬂected by the inner surface of a microwave cavity in the clock. This light heated the cavity and
caused a frequency drift from the resonant frequency of the cavity. Power ﬂuctuations of the cooling
light led to atomic density variations in the cavity’s central area, which increased the clock frequency
instability through a cavity pulling eﬀect. We overcame these limitations with appropriate solutions.
A frequency stability of 3.5 × 10−15 was achieved when the integrating time τ increased to 2 × 104
s.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The atomic frequency standards have been rapidly de-
veloped in the past three decades for applications in
space navigation, telecommunication, and timekeeping.
In most cases, a portable and stable atom clock is re-
quired. Researchers have proposed several schemes for
compact atom clocks and attempted to ensure the sta-
bility of the atomic clocks for a long operation time. A
frequency instability of 3.2 × 10−15 was determined using
HORACE when the integration time was 2×104 s, which
shows a good control of system noises [1]. The pulsed
optically pumped (POP) clock developed at INRIM has
an instability of 5 × 10−15 at a 4000 s integration time
[2]. The clock based on the intracavity sample of cold Cs
atoms proposed by Mller et al. achieved a frequency sta-
bility of 5.0 × 10−13τ −1/2 and shows a good performance
after 104 s [3].

The integrating sphere cold atom clock (ISCAC) [4] is
a kind of compact atomic clock that uses diﬀuse laser
cooling
[5–7] and the POP [8] operating scheme to
achieve a good frequency stability with a small volume
and weight. Compared with a vapor cell POP atomic
clock, the ISCAC has less atomic collision frequency
shifts and less sensitivity to the temperature ﬂuctuations
making it easier to achieve a better frequency stability for
a long operation time. Unlike other compact cold atom
clocks, ISCAC uses a microwave cavity to diﬀusely reﬂect
cooling light and cools atoms without a quartz chamber
in it [4]. This scheme can eliminate the inﬂuence of the
quartz chamber on the microwave resonant frequency in
the microwave cavity.
In addition, the all-metal struc-
ture of the clock is more robust and convenient for space
applications. However, the cooling-light heating eﬀect
on the microwave cavity is considerable and the resonant
frequency shift of the microwave cavity should be com-

pensated. The distribution of the cold atoms in the mi-
crowave cavity is determined by the injection scheme of
the cooling lights and the corresponding intensities [9].
Therefore, in our system, stable cooling lights are neces-
sary for decreasing the cavity pulling eﬀect [10], which
is the main limiting factor of the long-term frequency
stability.

In this paper, we present the medium-long term fre-
quency stability of ISCAC achieved recently and analyze
factors that have a large impact on the frequency stabil-
ity. The heating eﬀect on the microwave cavity owing
to the cooling lights and the necessity of stabilizing the
power of the cooling lights are studied. Section II brieﬂy
introduces the experimental setup and the operating time
sequence of the ISCAC. Section III presents the factors
limiting of the clock frequency stability and the solutions
to overcome these limitations. The results of the study of
the clock frequency stabilities are presented in this sec-
tion as well. The ﬁnal section presents the conclusion
and scope of improving the long-term frequency stability
of the clock further on.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND TIME

SEQUENCE

The ISCAC is operated using the POP conﬁguration,
which involves a diﬀuse laser cooling process before the
optical pumping [4]. In the cooling stage, 87Rb atoms
were cooled to below 100 µK [11] in isotropic cool-
ing light, which is diﬀusely reﬂected by the inner sur-
face of the microwave cavity. Then, the atoms were
pumped into the 52S1/2, |F = 1i state of the 87Rb D2
line with a short pumping light pulse in preparation for
the Ramsey microwave interrogation process. Fig. 1
shows the atomic levels of the 87Rb D2 line and the
optical and microwave ﬁelds used during the operation.
Finally, the atoms that experienced a clock transition
52S1/2|F = 2, mF = 0i → 52S1/2|F = 2, mF = 0i were
detected using a standing wave probe light after the sec-
ond Ramsey pulse. Acousto-optic modulators (AOM)

light to avoid optical frequency shifts of the clock tran-
sition. Fig. 2 shows the time sequence of the clock. We
discarded the second pumping pulse, which was used for
normalizing the probe light power ﬂuctuation during the
detection period [4], because the power lock of the probe
light was used instead. In addition, the cycle time with-
out the second pumping pulse was shortened to 88 ms,
which reduces the eﬀect of the microwave noise (Dick ef-
fect) and simpliﬁes the time sequence. Fig. 3 shows the
Ramsey fringes obtained with this time sequence.

III. DISCUSSIONS AND RESULTS

There are many factors that aﬀect the clock frequency
stability. Typically, the shot noise contribution to the
frequency stability can be evaluated theoretically using
the signal to noise ratio (RSN ) and quality factor (Qa)

of the atomic resonance line [12]. The Dick eﬀect con-
tribution to frequency stability can be evaluated with
the frequency noise spectrum of the LO and the duty
cycle of the microwave interrogation process
[13]. For
the ISCAC, the Dick eﬀect contribution decreased from
3.3 × 10−13τ −1/2 to 2.4 × 10−13τ −1/2 after adjusting
the time sequence. However, there are other factors,
such as temperature ﬂuctuations of the microwave cavity
and variation in the biased magnetic ﬁeld, that limit on
the medium-long term frequency stability. Therefore, to
achieve better clock frequency stability, several physical
and technical problems have to be solved.

Laser Power(mW)

Temperature stability is a very important factor that
aﬀects the stability of an atomic clock because many
physical characteristics of the clock devices are temper-
ature dependent. For the ISCAC, because the resonant
frequency of the cylindrical microwave cavity is suscep-
tible to temperature variations, we implemented a two
stage temperature control loop to stabilize the microwave
cavity temperature. However, this measure is not enough
to ensure temperature stabilization, especially after a
long period of operation . Owing to the special cool-
ing scheme of the ISCAC, the cooling light, which has
a total power about 200 mW was directly reﬂected by
the microwave cavity with the inner diameter and height
of 57 mm in each cycle. The laser heating eﬀect on the
microwave cavity is not negligible. Fig. 5 shows the re-
lationship between the injected laser power and the mi-
crowave cavity resonant frequency. When we adjust the
resonant frequency, the detuning caused by the heating
eﬀect must be considered and compensated by the tem-
perature control loop. In addition, the cold atom distri-
bution in the microwave cavity is largely determined by
the cooling light
[9]. Power ﬂuctuations in the cooling
lights will transfer to the instabilities of the cold atoms in
the microwave cavity. The ﬂuctuations in the number of
cold atoms will further degrade the clock frequency sta-

bility according to the model for estimating the cavity
frequency pulling eﬀect of an atomic fountain [10]:

where Q and Vmode are the TE011 mode quality factor
and mode volume,respectively. ωc/2π is the cavity eigen-
mode resonance frequency and ωa is the clock transi-
tion energy. Ni is the number of cold atoms that have
experienced the microwave interrogation process.In our
case, cavity pulling eﬀect is a dominant factor to af-
fect the medium-long term stability because the whole
stage of Ramsey interrogation is carried on in the mi-
crowave cavity [14]. Therefore, the intensity stability of
cooling light has a larger impact on the clock frequency
stability than other schemes of cold atom clocks. An
active power stabilization loop was required to decrease
the cooling light ﬂuctuations. After this servo loop was
implemented, the temperature stability of the microwave
cavity was found to not be a restrictive factor aﬀecting
the clock frequency stability. The temperature stability
of the microwave cavity during the experiment is shown
in Fig. 6. The temperature sensitivity of the microwave
cavity resonant frequency was 113.5 KHz/◦C , which was
calibrated in a vacuum environment before the installa-
tion [15]. Then the relative resonant frequency variation
δνc/νc was less than 2.0 × 10−8 and the contribution to
the clock frequency instability of the microwave cavity
temperature ﬂuctuations is at the level of 2.6 × 10−16.

The quantization magnetic ﬁeld (C-ﬁeld) is driven by two
low noise current sources. Fig. 7 shows the measured
stability of the current source. the second-order Zeeman
shift of the clock frequency can be estimated using the
equation shown below [12]:

where K0 = 575.14×108Hz/T 2,B is the biased magnetic
ﬁeld intensity and ˆz is the unit factor of the quantization
axis. To reduce the eﬀect of the second-order Zeeman
shift on the clock frequency stability, we reduced the the
C-ﬁeld intensity to 3.1 mG. In this situation, the second-
order Zeeman shift was 5.5 × 10−6Hz and the clock in-
stability degraded to 3.2 × 10−17 when the average time
increased to 2 × 104 s, which can be ignored for the sys-
tem.

Typically, the frequency stability of the ISCAC is mea-

shows two sets of frequency stability results of the clock
with diﬀerent experimental conditions. The Allan devia-
tion (black triangles) result is measured without locking

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We reported the improvement on the medium-long
term frequency stability of the ISCAC . The systematic
factors that aﬀect the clock medium-long term frequency
stability are discussed and their limitations on the clock
frequency stability were reduced by improving the exper-
imental conditions. In addition, the laser heating eﬀect
on the microwave cavity and the eﬀect of the cooling
laser power ﬂuctuations were studied and restrained by
employing appropriate solutions. The clock frequency
stability reached less than 10−15 when τ >4000 s and
3.5 × 10−15 at 2 × 104s. A new microwave synthesizer of
low phase noise and small volume is in the development
to decrease the noise and instability of the microwave in-
terrogation pulses. Meanwhile, further investigation on
improving the clock long-term frequency stability perfor-
mance will be conducted to determine the requirements
for practical applications.
