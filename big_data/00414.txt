ABSTRACT

Transit and radial velocity observations indicate a dearth of sub-Jupiter–mass planets on short-
period orbits, outlined roughly by two oppositely sloped lines in the period–mass plane. We interpret
this feature in terms of high-eccentricity migration of planets that arrive in the vicinity of the Roche
limit, where their orbits are tidally circularized, long after the dispersal of their natal disk. We
demonstrate that the two distinct segments of the boundary are a direct consequence of the diﬀerent
slopes of the empirical mass–radius relation for small and large planets, and show that this relation
also ﬁxes the mass coordinate of the intersection point. The period coordinate of this point, as well as
the detailed shape of the lower boundary, can be reproduced with a plausible choice of a key parameter
in the underlying migration model. The detailed shape of the upper boundary, on the other hand, is
determined by the post-circularization tidal exchange of angular momentum with the star and can be
reproduced with a stellar tidal quality factor Q′

1. INTRODUCTION

As has been known for some time now, radial-velocity
surveys of exoplanets exhibit an abrupt drop in the num-
ber of hot Jupiters (HJs) for orbital periods Porb .
3 days (e.g., Cumming et al. 2008), corresponding to
a pileup of such planets near Porb = 3 days (e.g.,
Gaudi et al. 2005) and their paucity at shorter peri-
ods (e.g., Zucker & Mazeh 2002).
(We deﬁne HJs as
planets that have masses in the range Mp ∼ 0.3–3 MJ,
where MJ is Jupiter’s mass, and periods Porb . 10 days.)
Planet candidates identiﬁed by transit measurements
exhibit a similar sharp drop in the number count be-
low Porb ∼ 3–4 days for objects with radii Rp & 4 R⊕
(e.g., Howard et al. 2012; Fressin et al. 2013). One in-
terpretation of these results invokes planet–planet scat-
tering events that place one of the interacting planets
on a highly eccentric orbit: that planet thereby attains
a small pericenter distance, where its orbit is circular-
ized through tidal interaction with the host star (e.g.,
Ford & Rasio 2006). In this picture, the shortest possible
pericenter distance is given by the Roche limit aR, where
the planet starts to be tidally disrupted, and the planet’s
resulting circular radius must therefore exceed ∼ 2 aR
(where the factor of 2 follows from conservation of orbital
angular momentum). A planet can also be placed on a
highly eccentric orbit by a more gradual process such as
Kozai (e.g., Wu & Murray 2003; Fabrycky & Tremaine
2007) or secular (e.g., Wu & Lithwick 2011; Petrovich
2015a) migration. An alternative interpretation at-
tributes the scarcity of high-Mp planets on short-period
orbits to tidal exchange of angular momentum with the
star, which causes close-in giant planets to spiral inward
and get ingested by their host (e.g., Jackson et al. 2009;
Teitler & K¨onigl 2014).

As data continued to accumulate, more details have
emerged about the structure of the planet distribution
at low values of Porb. In particular, Szab´o & Kiss (2011)
considered the (Porb, Mp) plane and identiﬁed a region

(deﬁned by Porb < 2.5 days and Mp between 0.02 and
0.8 MJ) with a pronounced dearth of planets, which they
termed the “sub-Jupiter desert.”1 They noted that this
region has both an upper boundary, consisting of HJs,
and a lower boundary, consisting of close-in super-Earths
(SEs), but is devoid of hot Neptunes. Similar identi-
ﬁcations were made by Beaug´e & Nesvorn´y (2013) and
by Mazeh et al. (2016) (with the latter authors approxi-
mating the boundary by two intersecting straight lines in
the (log Porb, log Mp) plane), and it is generally accepted
that this feature is not the result of some observational
bias.2 However, the origin of the desert is still being de-
bated (e.g., Szab´o & Kiss 2011; Ben´ıtez-Llambay et al.
2011; Beaug´e & Nesvorn´y 2013; Kurokawa & Nakamoto
2014; Batygin et al. 2016; Mazeh et al. 2016).
In one
proposed scenario (Kurokawa & Nakamoto 2014), the
desert is attributed to the evaporation of close-in giant
planets by the stellar radiation ﬁeld, followed by Roche-
lobe overﬂow. However, this picture also implies the com-
plete loss of the gaseous envelopes of the less massive SEs,
which is inconsistent with the fact that the inferred radii
of the planets near the lower boundary of the desert are
generally well in excess of 1.6 R⊕ and are thus unlikely
to be purely rocky (see Rogers 2015). In an alternative
scenario (Valsecchi et al. 2014, 2015), HJs arrive at the
Roche limit and undergo rapid mass loss through Roche-
lobe overﬂow, with photoevaporation further contribut-
ing to the removal of their envelopes. It was proposed
that this mechanism could convert HJs into SEs, but it is
not obvious that the resulting low-mass planet distribu-

1 As discussed in that paper as well as in the other studies of
this topic that we cite, a complementary description of the sub-
Jovian desert can be given in the (Porb, Rp) plane. However, in
view of the degeneracy of the Mp(Rp) relation for large planets
(see Equation (1) below), we consider only the (Porb, Mp) plane
in this work.

In fact, several planets are known to lie inside the nominal
desert, although so far all such planets are located near the desert’s
edges (e.g., Col´on et al. 2015).

tion would be consistent with the observed shape of the
desert’s lower boundary. Yet another possibility is that
the desert arises from the in-situ formation of HJs by gas
accretion onto SE cores (Boley et al. 2016; Batygin et al.
2016). However, this picture also faces various challenges
(e.g., Inamdar & Schlichting 2015).

In this Letter we propose that the boundary of the
desert reﬂects the locus of the innermost circularized or-
bits of planets that arrived in the vicinity of the host star
through planet-planet scattering, Kozai migration (aris-
ing from an interaction with either a stellar or a plane-
tary companion), or a secular process long after the pro-
toplanetary disk had dispersed. As was already pointed
out by Ford & Rasio (2006), the Roche limit aR (which is
taken to be the distance of closest approach for a planet
arriving via either scattering or Kozai migration) is a
function of both Rp and Mp (for a given host mass M∗),
and it can therefore be expressed (using the appropriate
mass–radius relation) as a function of Mp. A similar ex-
pression can be written down for the expected distance
of closest approach in the secular chaos scenario. Using
an empirical Rp(Mp) relation, we demonstrate that this
picture can account for the basic shape of the desert’s
boundary, with its oppositely sloped upper and lower
segments. We further show that the detailed structure
of the boundary can be qualitatively reproduced when
one also takes into account the orbital evolution induced
in close-in planets by their tidal interaction with the host
star. These results on the behavior of late-arriving close-
in planets complement recent inferences about the evo-
lution of an earlier generation of HJs that had migrated
though the natal disk (Matsakos & K¨onigl 2015).

2. MODELING APPROACH

Since most of the planets in the vicinity of the desert’s
boundary are inferred to have low eccentricities (e < 0.1;
see Figure 1 below), we focus on scenarios in which plan-
ets are placed on high-eccentricity orbits that are cir-
cularized by internal tidal dissipation after the planets
arrive in the vicinity of the host star. For any given
system, we label by tarr the time at which the planet
under consideration arrives at the stellar vicinity with
orbital eccentricity e0. After arrival, its orbit is circular-
ized to a radius ac (where its orbital period is Porb) on a
timescale τc ∝ Q′
p is the planet’s
tidal quality factor (e.g., Matsumura et al. 2010a). Plan-
ets along the lower boundary of the desert have low values
of Rp, which has the eﬀect of increasing τc. However, the
smallest such planets would be mostly rocky and would
thus also have low values of Q′
p (e.g., Goldreich & Soter
1966), so their orbits might still be circularized over the
planets’ typical ages (tage & 1 Gyr).
In this work we
relate Rp and Mp through the empirical relation ob-
tained by Weiss et al. (2013). They divided their sam-
ple into small and large planets (superscripts S and L,
respectively), separated at Mp ≈ 150 M⊕, and wrote
down power-law relationships that we further approxi-
mate here by adopting the median incident ﬂux of the
data set (F = 8.6 × 108 erg s−1 cm−2) and rounding to
the ﬁrst decimal ﬁgure in each exponent:

τd ∼ [(Q′

Matsumura et al. 2010a). Given that τd ∝ 1/Mp, the
planets on the lower boundary of the desert are hardly
aﬀected by this interaction; however, the initial period
distribution of the circularized orbits of large planets is
measurably modiﬁed.

2.1. Initial Locus of Innermost Planets with

Circularized Orbits

The post-circularization locus in the (Porb, Mp) plane
of the lowest-Porb planets can be obtained for both the
planet–planet scattering and Kozai migration cases from
the expression for the Roche limit (RL),

aR = q (M∗/Mp)1/3 Rp ,

(2)

where the precise value of the coeﬃcient q depends on
the planet’s structural and orbital characteristics. Two
of the most frequently cited estimates are q = 2.16
(Paczy´nski 1971) and q = 2.7 (Guillochon et al. 2011),
but there are indications that its value in real systems
could be higher (up to ∼ 3.6–3.8; Valsecchi & Rasio
2014; Petrovich 2015b). As it turns out, the interpre-
tation of the sub-Jovian desert in terms of the Roche
limit also favors a comparatively large value for q (≃ 3.5;
see Section 3). Under the assumption that e0 ≈ 1, the
circularization radius is ≃ 2 aR and thus can be written
as

ac,RL ≈ 0.03 (cid:16) q

3(cid:17)(cid:18) M∗

M⊙(cid:19)1/3(cid:18) Mp

MJ(cid:19)−1/3(cid:18) Rp

RJ(cid:19) AU .

(3)
In the secular chaos (SC) model, the circularization
radius was estimated by Wu & Lithwick (2011) as twice
the pericenter distance obtained by equating the preces-
sion rate of a planet’s longitude of pericenter—due to a
secular interaction with another planet located farther
out—with the orbit-averaged precession rate due to the
tidal quadrupole induced on the planet by the star. This
yields

ac,SC ≈ 0.03(cid:18) α

where Mpert is the mass of the perturbing planet and
α is the ratio of the semimajor axes of the two planets.
For the sake of simplicity, we henceforth ﬁx α at its nor-
malization value and treat Mpert as the relevant model
parameter.3

By combining Equations (1), (3), and (4), and using

It is seen that in both cases the inferred boundary has a
negatively sloped upper branch and a positively sloped
lower branch. This basic property of the observed sub-
Jovian desert is a generic feature of our proposed inter-
pretation, arising from the diﬀerent slopes in the empir-
ical Rp(Mp) relation for large and small planets.

2.2. Eﬀect of Tidally Induced Orbital Evolution

We calculate this eﬀect following the procedure out-
lined in Matsakos & K¨onigl (2015). We perform Monte
Carlo simulations for a population of 30,000 plane-
tary systems, assuming solar-type hosts (M∗ = M⊙,
R∗ = R⊙) with initial rotation periods distributed uni-
formly in the range 5–10 days, and drawing ages in
the range 1–8 Gyr from the empirical distribution of
∗ = 106
Walkowicz & Basri (2013). We also adopt Q′
(see Section 3). The values of Porb and Rp are chosen
from the observationally inferred distributions presented
in Youdin (2011), with Mp deduced from the Rp(Mp)
compilation of Weiss et al. (2013) (using their inferred
power-law ﬁt for small planets but accounting for the
observed scatter in both radius and mass for those with
Mp & 150 M⊕).4 We further assume a random distribu-
tion for the initial angle between the stellar spin and the
orbital plane, and that the distribution of planet arrival
times is uniform in log tarr (see Section 4). These choices
are summarized in Table 1.

For each system, we integrate the evolution equations
for the stellar and orbital angular momenta, taking into
account the eﬀects of equilibrium tides and of magnetic
braking. We assume that all orbits in a multi-planet sys-
tem remain coplanar, but we neglect planet–planet in-
teractions. We carry out the calculations for each of the
two distributions obtained in Section 2.1, removing from
consideration any planet drawn with an initial semima-
jor axis that is less than ac,RL (Equation (3)) or ac,SC
(Equation (4)). Given that we do not include systems
with tage ≤ 1 Gyr in our population counts, our pre-

4 The adopted distributions of Porb and Rp are in the form of
a single power law and thus do not capture the detailed behavior
of planets in this region of the period–mass plane. However, since
our focus is on the shape of the desert’s boundary and not on
reproducing the observed density of planets, we do not consider
more elaborate distributions.

dicted distributions do not reveal the possible presence
of close-in giant planets that arrive at the stellar vicin-
ity by migration through the natal disk. The contribu-
tion of such early-arriving planets to the observed num-
ber count is, however, small due to their relatively rapid
tidal ingestion by the star. Nevertheless, as was noted
by Matsakos & K¨onigl (2015), these HJs could have a
strong inﬂuence on the observed distribution of the an-
gle between the stellar spin and the orbital plane. Based
on that work, we take account of this eﬀect by including,
at time t = 0, a “stranded HJ” (SHJ) characterized by
MSHJ = 0.6 MJ, RSHJ = RJ, and PSHJ = 2 days in (ran-
domly selected) 50% of the modeled systems. A giant
planet of this type would undergo tidal ingestion by a
G-type star on a timescale of ∼ 0.7 Gyr.

3. RESULTS

Figure 1 presents the predicted distributions in the
(Porb, log Mp) plane for the RL and SC models. For
the RL model we also plot the relation obtained from
combining Equations (1) and (3) for three values of the
parameter q,5 whereas for the SC model we show the cor-
responding relation obtained from Equations (1) and (4)
for three values of Mpert.6 It is seen that each of these
scenarios can reproduce the observed shape of the sub-
Jovian desert’s boundary quite well. The initial circular-
ization locus accounts for the basic “bird’s beak” conﬁgu-
ration of the boundary, but only the shape of its low-mass
segment (along which orbital evolution eﬀects are negli-
gible) and the location of the vertex (where the upper
and lower segments intersect) are preserved in the ﬁnal
distribution. The mass coordinate of the vertex is ﬁxed
by the transition point (Mp ≈ 150 M⊕) of the empirical
mass–radius relation and is independent of the details of
the underlying planet migration model; the fact that it
matches the observations so accurately is a strong indica-
tion that this aspect of the small/large planets dichotomy
plays a key role in determining the desert’s shape. On
the other hand, the plots in the left panels of Figure 1
demonstrate that the period coordinate of the vertex is
sensitive to the value of the relevant model parameter. In
each case, however, the inferred best-ﬁt value has a plau-
sible magnitude. In the RL picture, the comparatively
large indicated value of q (≃ 3.5) is consistent with other
recent determinations (e.g., Valsecchi & Rasio 2014, who
derived the initial locations of HJs detected inside the
Roche limit; and Petrovich 2015b, who investigated the
formation of HJs by Kozai migration).
In the case of
secular chaos, the inference that Mpert ≈ Mp is also em-
inently reasonable. For Jupiter-mass planets, the exci-
tation of secular interactions would be much weaker if
the companion planet’s mass were measurably less than
that of the innermost planet (e.g., Wu & Lithwick 2011),
whereas for SE planets, comparable-mass objects are the
most frequent companions and are thus the most likely
to act as perturbers. Note that the value of the model
parameter (q or Mpert) also aﬀects the predicted shape of

5 The values 2.16 and 2.70 represent the estimates listed in
Section 2.1, whereas q = 3.46 corresponds to our best ﬁt to the
desert’s shape.

6 In deriving these relations, we use the power-law scalings listed
in Equation (1) for small and large planets, and divide the two
populations at the value of Mp (≃ 150 M⊕) given in Weiss et al.
(2013).

the innermost circularized orbits (applicable to planets arriving at the stellar vicinity through either scattering or Kozai migration), whereas
the bottom panels correspond to the secular migration model. For each of these two cases, the left and right panels show, respectively,
the initial distribution of planets on circular orbits and the ﬁnal distribution obtained by calculating the eﬀect of tidally induced orbital
evolution. The initial planet distribution in the left panels was obtained by sampling empirical distributions of the orbital period, planetary
radius, and system age as well as the adopted arrival-time distribution and the empirical Rp(Mp) relation (see Table 1). Analytic predictions
for the inner edge of this distribution are also shown in each case in the left panel for several values of the relevant model parameter. The
data shown in the right panels are for all conﬁrmed planets listed in exolanets.org (Han et al. 2014) as of 2015 December 16, and are

the lower branch of the desert’s boundary, which further
constrains the choice of the best match.

The shape of the upper boundary is largely indepen-
dent of the details of the initial distribution of high-
mass planets, and is determined mainly by the ensu-
ing orbital evolution. It is well reproduced—in the con-
text of the equilibrium tidal interaction model that we
∗ ∼ 106,
employ—with a stellar tidal quality factor Q′
which is consistent with previous inferences from mod-
eling the Porb distribution of HJs (e.g., Teitler & K¨onigl
2014; Essick & Weinberg 2016).
It is noteworthy that
the two alternative models originally proposed to explain
the spatial distribution of HJs—circularization of highly
eccentric orbits and tidal exchange of angular momen-
tum with the star—are both found to be relevant in the
context of the current interpretation when the detailed
distribution in the (Porb, Mp) plane is taken into account.

4. DISCUSSION

Our proposed interpretation of the sub-Jovian desert’s
shape—that it is a natural consequence of the orbital
circularization of planets that arrive at the stellar vicin-
ity on high-eccentricity orbits and of their subsequent
tidal angular-momentum exchange with the star—is con-
sistent with the ﬁnding that the eccentricity distri-
bution of giant planets broadens with increasing pe-
riod (e.g., Winn & Fabrycky 2015) and with the evi-
dence for ongoing orbital evolution of the innermost
HJs (e.g., Valsecchi & Rasio 2014; Teitler & K¨onigl 2014;
Essick & Weinberg 2016). The latter result, in turn, sup-
ports the view that the observed HJs are mostly late-
arriving planets rather than the product of migration in
the protoplanetary disk. The high-eccentricity migra-
tion scenario, in which the ingoing planet is placed on a
high-e0 orbit through gravitational interaction with one
or more massive bodies (other planets or a binary star),
is consistent with the indicated high occurrence rate of
planetary and stellar companions in systems that harbor
HJs (e.g. Knutson et al. 2014; Ngo et al. 2015). We con-
sidered three possible pathways to such an outcome—
planet-planet scattering, Kozai migration, and secular
drift—and inferred that in principle they could all play
a role. However, a more detailed examination is required
to determine the actual contribution of each of these pro-
cesses. One pertinent question is whether the inﬂuence
of the process extends to late times; for example, sec-
ular chaos is inherently a long-lasting interaction, for
which the expected distribution of arrival times is ap-
proximately uniform in log tarr (Y. Lithwick, personal
communication), whereas scattering likely only plays a
role at early times (. 108 yr; e.g., Chatterjee et al. 2008;
Juri´c & Tremaine 2008). Another relevant question con-
cerns the rate of eccentricity growth in the high-e migra-

tion model; for example, Wu & Lithwick (2011) argued
that the observed ∼ 3-day pileup of HJs is more likely
to have been caused by a slow process such as Kozai or
secular migration than by sudden scattering events (see
also Nagasawa et al. 2008). Further studies are needed
to fully address this issue.

One attractive feature of the proposed interpretation
is that it can simultaneously reproduce both the up-
per and the lower segments of the desert’s boundary.
An alternative possibility for the low-mass branch is
that it arises from the in-situ formation of close-in SEs
(Mazeh et al. 2016), which has been recently explored
in the literature (e.g., Lee & Chiang 2016). However,
arguments have also been given in favor of formation at
larger distances (up to a few AU) and subsequent inward
migration (e.g., Schlichting 2014; Inamdar & Schlichting
2015). Our model for the sub-Jovian desert is consistent
with the latter picture.

The scenario considered in this work, which involves
late-arriving planets, complements the SHJs model pre-
sented in Matsakos & K¨onigl (2015), which is concerned
with early-arriving HJs. That model explains the good
alignment exhibited by a signiﬁcant fraction of HJs
around cool (G type) stars—as well as the good align-
ment inferred for more distant planets around such
stars—vs.
the broad range of obliquities exhibited by
HJs around hot (F type) stars. As we noted in Sec-
tion 2, the earlier population of HJs would not aﬀect the
observed properties of the sub-Jovian desert because of
the relatively short SHJ ingestion time. However, consis-
tency with the SHJs scenario requires the orbital plane
of any late-arriving planet to roughly coincide with that
of the natal disk. This additional constraint on the high-
eccentricity migration model need not, however, be too
diﬃcult to fulﬁll. For example, Matsumura et al. (2010b)
found that only ∼ 15% of planets in a 3-planet system
that emerges out of a gas disk have orbital inclinations
> 10◦, and Lithwick & Wu (2014) discovered that, even
if larger initial inclinations are allowed, 60% of the HJs
formed through secular migration involving a 3-planet
system have projected obliquities < 10◦. Furthermore,
Petrovich (2015a) demonstrated the feasibility of pro-
ducing HJs through coplanar high-e migration (a secular
process involving 2 planets).

We are grateful to Tsevi Mazeh for alerting us to the
“bird’s beak” shape of the sub-Jovian desert’s boundary.
We thank him as well as Dan Fabrycky, Yoram Lith-
wick, Leslie Rogers, and the referee for helpful input.
