ABSTRACT

The crystalline silicates features are mainly reﬂected in infrared bands. The

Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) collected numerous spectra of various ob-

jects and provided a big database to investigate crystalline silicates in a wide

range of astronomical environments. We apply the manifold ranking algorithm

to perform a systematic search for the spectra with crystalline silicates features

in the Spitzer IRS Enhanced Products available.

In total, 868 spectra of 790

sources are found to show the features of crystalline silicate. These objects

are cross-matched with the SIMBAD database as well as with the Large Sky

Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST)/DR2. The aver-

age spectrum of young stellar objects show a variety of features dominated either

by forsterite or enstatite or neither, while the average spectrum of evolved objects

consistently present dominant features of forsterite in AGB, OH/IR, post-AGB

and planetary nebulae. They are identiﬁed optically as early-type stars, evolved

stars, galaxies and so on. In addition, the strength of spectral features in typical

silicate complexes is calculated. The results are available through CDS for the

astronomical community to further study crystalline silicate.

Introduction

In the interstellar space silicates get modiﬁed, destroyed and potentially reformed,

they play an important role in the cosmic life cycle of matter. As an important component

of circumstellar and interstellar dust, silicates provide information about the size of grains

and the chemical composition of dust. Their mid-infrared spectral features can help us

to get the information about the density and thermal structure of circumstellar disks and

envelopes (see Henning 2010).

All the earlier observations showed that the feature bands of silicates are broad and

smooth around 9.7µm and 18µm (see Molster & Kemper 2005) respectively. Dorschner et al.

(1995) used laboratory data to identify the carrier of these features to be amorphous olivine

silicates. Later, the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and the Spitzer Space Telescope

obtained a lot of infrared spectra with high sensitivity and high resolution, which opened a

new window for us to identify and investigate the spectral features of crystalline silicates.

Molster et al. (2002a,b,c) systematically studied the spectral features of crystalline silicate

and diversiﬁed them into 7 distinct complexes using the ISO/SWS (Short Wavelength

Spectrometer) and LWS (Long Wavelength Spectrometer) spectra, which are called the

10µm (7-13µm), 18µm (15-20µm,), 23µm (22-25.5µm,), 28µm (26.5-31.5µm), 33µm

(31.5-37.5µm), 40µm (38-44.5µm) and 69µm (50-72µm) complex respectively.

Crystalline silicates have been identiﬁed in various scales (solar system, stars, galaxies

and quasars), such as comet, protoplanetary disk of Herbig Ae/Be stars and T Tauri stars,

debris disks around the main sequence stars (Li & Greenberg 1998), circumstellar envelopes

in post-main sequence stars (Water et al. 1996; Sylvester et al. 1999; Molster et al. 2002a;

Jiang et al. 2013), very bright infrared galaxies (Markwick-Kemper et al. 2007; Spoon et al.

2006), quasars (Markwick-Kemper et al. 2007; Aller et al. 2012; Xie et al. 2014), etc.

In this work, we present a systematic search for the spectra with features of crystalline

– 4 –

silicates from the Spitzer IRS Enhanced Products (Houck et al. 2004). In Section 2, a

brief description is presented about the Spitzer IRS Enhanced Products (Houck et al.

2004). The method we used is manifold ranking (MR) algorithm ﬁrstly proposed by

Zhou et al. (2004a,b), which will be described in Section 3.1. The selected objects with

crystalline silicate features are cross identiﬁed with the SIMBAD database as well as with

the LAMOST optical spectroscopy in Section 3.3.

2. Data description

Spectra taken by the InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS) (Houck et al. 2004) on the Spitzer

space telescope (Werner et al. 2004) are now publicly available. These spectra are produced

using the bksub.tbl products from SL and LL modules of ﬁnal SSC pipeline, version 18.18.

From the IRS data archive, we found a collection of 16986 low-resolution spectra. The

spectra are merged by 4 slits which are SL2 (5.21∼7.56µm), SL1 (7.57∼14.28µm), LL2

(14.29∼20.66µm) and LL1 (20.67∼38.00µm). As crystalline silicates have no features in

the SL2 band, we choose the spectra which include all the other three bands SL1, LL2 and

LL1 so that the object has a continuous spectrum from about 7.5µm to 38µm. In this way,

ﬁve of the seven infrared complexes of crystalline silicates are covered, i.e. the 10, 18, 23,

28 and 33µm complexes. Consequently, 9711 spectra are picked up. Fig. 1 shows the S/N

distribution of these 9711 spectra for the three IRS slits respectively. In order to reduce the

noise, median ﬁltering is applied. The main idea of median ﬁltering is to run through the

spectrum pixel by pixel, replacing each pixel with the median of neighboring pixels. Here

we use median ﬁltering with a width of 5 pixels which means each pixel is replaced with

the median of 5 neighboring pixels. Because the spectral features of silicate dust, even of

crystalline silicate, are much wider than the atomic and ionic lines, they are not aﬀected by

the median ﬁltering. Fig. 2 compares the spectrum before and after the median ﬁltering

and proves its eﬃciency in depressing the high-frequency noise and spikes.

3. Search for spectra with crystalline silicates features

3.1. Method and result

Considering a sample set X = {x1, · · · , xq, xq+1, · · · , xn}, the ﬁrst q units are labelled

and belong to the same class (here are the known spectra with crystalline silicate features),

and the rest are unlabelled (here are 9711 spectra from the Spitzer IRS). Our task is to

retrieve the units similar to the labelled ones. In general, the labelled sample is much smaller

compared with the whole sample, namely q << n. Manifold ranking (MR) (Zhou et al.

2004a,b) can rank the unlabelled units according to their similarity to the labelled and

improve the results by using the relationship between unlabelled and labelled units.

Let F : X −→ R denotes a ranking function which assigns to each unit xi a ranking

value Fi. Let Y = [Y1, . . . , Yn]T , in which Yi = 1 if xi is a labelled unit, and Yi = 0 otherwise.

The procedure of MR is as follows:

1. Construct the weighted graph G = (X, W ) by using a kNN (k Nearest Neighbor)

graph, where W is a symmetric adjacency matrix. Wij represents similarity between

unit xi and xj and is deﬁned by:

Wij =




−d2(xi,xj )

2σ2

xi,xj are connected and i 6= j

(1)

others

e

0

where d(xi, xj) is the distance between xi and xj, here we use the Euclidean distance,

and σ is a constant that controls the strength of the weight.

2. Form the matrix S = D−1/2W D−1/2, where D is a diagonal matrix with its

(i,i)-element equals to the sum of the i-th row of W.

– 6 –

3. Iterate F (t + 1) = αSF (t) + (1 − α)Y until convergence, where α is a parameter in

(0,1). The intuitive description of this step is that all the units spread their scores to

the nearby units via the weighted graph.

4. Let F ∗ = F (t), sort F ∗ in descending order and return index rank.

The basis of the labelled sample for MR is the 38 Spitzer/IRS spectra that have

crystalline silicate features from Jones et al. (2012), which is a relatively large sample and

also taken by Spitzer /IRS. Our mission is to retrieve the spectrum which has crystalline

silicate features similar to the labelled samples. It should be noted that 28 of the 38 Jones’s

sources are within the 9711 spectra, which means some duplication. As an example, Fig. 3

shows one of the spectra, with prominent emission at the complexes of crystalline silicates.

Before the MR algorithm is performed, the median-ﬁltered spectrum is normalized by

Minimum-Maximum standardization using following formula:

spi =

spi − min(sp)

max(sp) − min(sp)

(2)

where spi is the i-th pixel of the spectrum sp, so that the maximum is normalized to unique

for the convenience of calculation.

In order to verify the completeness and stability of MR, we test the result by varying

the number of labelled units. We randomly select a given number n of spectra with

crystalline silicates features from the 38 sources to compose the labelled sample, while

the non-selected spectra with crystalline silicates features and all the 9711 spectra from

Spitzer /IRS consist the unlabelled sample. We vary the number n of labelled units in {1,

10, 19, 28, 37}. Then we use MR to get the ranking list. We use n to denote the number

of labelled units, R@k to denote what fraction of the 38 known spectra with crystalline

silicates features are retrieved within the top k ranking spectra and NI@k to denote m/k

where m is the number of intersection within the top k ranking spectra between diﬀerent n.

– 7 –

The test results of diﬀerent n are displayed in Fig. 4. From the left ﬁgure, it can be

seen that the non-selected spectra with crystalline silicates’ features are found within top

900 ranking when n=10, 19, 28 and 37, while 97% non-selected spectra are found within

top 1300 ranking when n=1. Meanwhile, the right ﬁgure tells that the ranking list is stable

against the change of the number of labelled samples when n ≥19.

The top 2000 ranking samples are selected for ﬁnal eye-checking. 868 spectra are found

to show crystalline silicates features (see Table 1). From Table 1 we can see the spectrum

has higher probability with crystalline silicates features when its ranking is higher, and

we can hardly ﬁnd any spectra with crystalline silicates features when their rankings are

behind 2000. The spectra of the sources ranking at 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 are

displayed in Fig. 5. The S/N distribution of these 868 spectra in Fig. 6 indicates that most

of the sources have S/N > 10 in the SL1 and LL2 bands (∼ 7 − 21µm), much better than

the average of primordial 9711 sample objects.

3.2.

Intensity of the spectral features of crystalline silicates

We consider that the observed ﬂux is contributed by dust continuum (Fcont), and dust

spectral features from both amorphous silicate (Famo) and crystalline silicate (Fcrys):

Fobs = Fcont + Famo + Fcrys

(3)

For each spectrum, we ﬁrst modeled the dust continuum by ﬁtting a piecewise polynomial

of degree 3 to anchor points. Following the analysis of Watson et al. (2009), we selected

the following anchor points: 7.57-7.94, 13.02-13.50, 30.16-32.19, and 35.07-35.92µm which

are not aﬀected by solid-state emission features. After the continuum is subtracted, the

amorphous silicate features around 10µm and 18µm are ﬁtted by:

Famo(ν) ∼ B(Tamo, ν) × Qamo(ν)

(4)

– 8 –

where B(Tamo, ν) is a blackbody radiation at the temperature Tamo, and Qamo(ν) is the

absorption eﬃciency of amorphous silicate. The absorption eﬃciency of amorphous silicate

is based on the optical constants of Ossenkopf et al. (1992) assuming the dust to be spherical

with radii a = 0.1µm, following the numerals of Jiang et al. (2013). The temperature of

amorphous silicate is adjusted in the range of 40-1200 K at an interval of 10 K to achieve

the best ﬁtting. The residual after subtracting the dust continuum and the spectral features

of amorphous silicate is taken to be the spectral features of crystalline silicate. Fig. 7 shows

an example. It can be seen that the amorphous silicate features take a priority over the

crystalline silicate since ﬁtting the amorphous spectral features are maximized to match the

spectrum after the continuum is subtracted. This ﬁtting may under-estimate the intensity

of the spectral features of crystalline silicate, which means we are obtaining a lower limit of

the intensity ratio of crystalline to amorphous silicate’s features in the following.

The intensity of crystalline silicate bands is measured in order to understand their

properties in relation to stellar parameters. Here the equivalent widths of the 10, 18, 23, 28

and 33µm features, Weq is deﬁned as:

Weq = X

λ

Fcrys
Fcont

△λ

(5)

The wavelength interval of each feature agrees with that deﬁned by Molster et al. (2002a)

and described in Section 1.

The signiﬁcance level of the crystalline silicate is calculated in each band as

where Fcrys is crystalline silicate ﬂux and σcrys is the uncertainty in the measured ﬂux,

S/U =

Fcrys
σcrys

Fcrys = X

λ

(Fobs − Fcont − Famo)∆λ

crys = X
σ2

λ

((Xfac ∗ (Fcont + Famo))2 + σ2)∆λ2

(6)

(7)

(8)

– 9 –

where σ is statistical uncertainty in each resolved element of the spectra, and Xfac is the

uncertainty in the determination of the underlying continuum and amorphous silicate,

which we conservatively assumed to be 10% (Xfac = 0.1). The value of Xfac is the same

as that adopted by Mittal et al. (2015) since we both deal with the Spitzer /IRS

spectrum and determine the continuum in a similar way. In addition, some

experiments are carried out by choosing the neighbouring points of default

anchor points for the determination of continuum and amorphous silicate’s

features. It is found the scattering of the dust continuum and amorphous

silicate features are both less than 0.1. The results of signiﬁcance level in each band

are listed in Table 4.

We also calculate the crystallinity which can provide a quantitative measure of the

percentage of crystalline silicate and deﬁned as

Crystallinity =

Pλ Fcrys∆λ

Pλ Fcrys∆λ + Pλ Famo∆λ

(9)

The results of crystallinity are listed in Table 4. Considering that amorphous silicate can

contribute to the continuum emission, a lower limit of crystallinity deﬁned by ﬂux ratio is

also calculated as:

The results are in Table 4.

Crystallinity min = Pλ Fcrys∆λ
Pλ Fobs∆λ

(10)

3.3.

Identiﬁcation in the SIMBAD and LAMOST/DR2 databases

The 868 spectra are cross identiﬁed with the SIMBAD database to learn the types of

sources and the results are presented in Table 5. Removing duplicate sources, there are 790

sources whose classiﬁcation is summarized in Table 6. Many of the sources are in the early

stage of evolution, including the Orion-type variables, T Tauri stars, pre-main sequence

– 10 –

stars, Herbig Ae/Be stars, FU Ori type. The second most popular class is in the late stage

of evolution. They are mostly the low-mass evolved stars such as AGB stars, OH/IR stars,

post-AGB stars or proto-planetary nebulae, and planetary nebulae, as well as carbon stars

and S-type stars. At the same time, the massive stars in late stage of evolution are also

present, such as red and blue supergiants. The detection of crystalline silicate has been

reported widely in the early and late stage of stellar evolution. In addition, crystalline

silicate emission is found in diﬀerent types of variables, such as nova, BY Dra type, RR

Lyr type, delta Sct type, and several types of long-period pulsating variables. Many types

have only one object in our identiﬁed sample of crystalline silicate emitters. Conﬁrmation

of these types of objects needs more serious investigation.

The average spectrum is calculated for the types which have more than ﬁve objects by

a weighted mean according to the ﬂux intensity. It should be noted that the objects can

be generally divided into two major classes, i.e. the young stellar objects and the evolved

stars, even though the SIMBAD types are various. The young stellar objects may include

all the types in the early stage of evolution, such as pre-main sequence star and proto-star,

while pre-main sequence star may include the low-mass T Tau-type star (which can also

be Orion-type variable) and massive Herbig Ae/Be star. On the other hand, AGB star,

OH/IR star, post-AGB star, planetary nebula etc. are all in the late evolutionary stage

of low-mass star. The variable stars (semi-regular, long-period, Mira-type) are overlapped

with the evolved stars. As shown in Fig. 8, we divided the objects into four major classes:

young stellar objects, evolved stars, variable stars and other types. In the ﬁnal, the average

spectra of all young stellar objects and all evolved stars are compared in Fig. 8 (e). It can

be seen that the young stellar objects generally have colder continuum than evolved stars.

In respect to the spectral features of crystalline silicate, the evolved stars have wider feature

around 10µm, and show a more evident peak at about 11.2µm. In comparison with the

absorption coeﬃcient of typical crystalline silicates – forsterite and enstatite, such proﬁle

– 11 –

points to a richer amount of forsterite in the evolved stars than in young stellar objects.

Consistently, the features at 20µm and 24µm of forsterite are also prominent. Nevertheless,

it should be noted that the young stellar objects exhibit diversity among sub-types: T

Tau-type stars have a raised red wing like evolved stars, Herbig Ae/Be star have a raised

blue wing, while the Orion-type variables show a ﬂat top around 10µm. Such distinction

between T Tau-type stars and Herbig Ae/Be stars is diﬀerent from previous studies. It was

believed that the spectra of T Tau-type stars in the 10µm range trace the warm inner disk

and thus show more enstatite features (e.g. Bouwman et al. 2008) while Herbig Ae/Be stars

trace the cold outer disk and thus more forsterite features (e.g. Juhasz et al. 2010). Our

average spectra show a contrary tendency. A possible reason for this discrepancy is

that the average spectrum may be aﬀected by the dust continuum. Removing

the dust continuum emission, we can see that the T Tau-type stars show the

features dominated by enstatite and the Herbig Ae/Be stars show the features

dominated by forsterite in the 10µm range as can be seen in Fig. 8 (f). This

is then consistent with previous conclusion. On the other hand, the evolved stars

conform to the average spectrum. AGB stars, OH/IR stars, post-AGB stars and planetary

nebulae all point to a raised red wing of the 10µm feature, indicating the dominant role of

forsterite. This consistent scenario implies similar condition for crystallization of silicate

dust in the circumstellar envelope of evolved stars. One exception is the RV Tau-type

variables which shows no dominance of spectral features of forsterite. As RV Tau-type stars

are usually post-AGB stars in a binary system, there may be disk-like structure to inﬂuence

the composition of crystalline silicate.

The identiﬁed sample is also cross matched with the LAMOST/DR2 catalog resulting

in 91 identiﬁcations. As LAMOST is an optical spectroscopic survey, the objects are

classiﬁed spectroscopically, with their types listed in Table 7 and the summary of spectral

types in Table 8. Very interestingly, 83 of 91 (i.e. 91%) sources have strong Hα emission

– 12 –

line. The Hα emission is usually associated with circumstellar disk or envelope in early-type

stars or chromospheric activity in late-type dwarf stars. Whether the condition to excite

the Hα emission is related to the crystallization of silicate deserves further investigation.

From this high percentage of Hα emission occurrence in the LAMOST identiﬁed sample,

there should be some connection between these two phenomena. The types span the stellar

classes M-, K-, G-, F- and A-type, and one white dwarf and one quasar. A careful check

conﬁrmed the spectral classiﬁcation, except the white dwarf identiﬁcation. On the other

hand, 3 stars have strong Hα absorption line. Fig. 9 shows one optical LAMOST spectrum

with the Hα emission line.

4. Summary

We performed a systematic search for objects with spectral features of crystalline

silicate in the Spitzer /IRS enhanced products using the manifold ranking method. The

primary results of our study are as follows.

1. We identiﬁed 790 sources whose IRS spectrum presents the crystalline silicates’

features.

2. The equivalent widths of the 10, 18, 23, 28 and 33µm features of each spectrum are

calculated to characterize the strengths of crystalline silicates features.

3. The sources with crystalline silicates are cross-identiﬁed in the SIMBAD database for

the type of each object. The average spectrum is calculated for the types with more

than ﬁve objects. It is found that the average spectrum of young stellar objects shows

a variety with the features dominated either by enstatite or by forsterite, while the

evolved stars all show dominance of the spectral features of forsterite in AGB, OH/IR

stars, post-AGB stars and planetary nebulae.

– 13 –

4. The crystalline silicate stars are cross-identiﬁed with the LAMOST spectroscopy

which results in 91 optically identiﬁed objects. It is found that 83 (91%)of them show

Hα emission line.
