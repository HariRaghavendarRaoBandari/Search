Introduction

Parallel mean curvature tori in real four-dimensional space forms are tori with constant
mean curvature(cmc) that lie on a totally geodesic hypersurface or an umbilical hyper-
surface of the ambient space, as proved independently by Hoﬀman [15], Chen [4], Yau
[24]. The study of such cmc tori in real three-dimensional space forms is a topic in the
theory of submanifolds (see, for example, Wente [23], Abresch [1], Pinkall and Sterling
[20], Bobenko [3], and Andrews and Li [2]). In the above-mentioned studies, parallel mean
curvature tori in the complex two-plane C2 are classiﬁed by identifying C2 with real Eu-
clidean four-space. In this paper, we study such tori in non-ﬂat two-dimensional complex
space forms. The main result of this paper tells us that the non-ﬂat case is much simpler
than the ﬂat one. In fact, Theorem 4.4 of this paper states that a non-zero parallel mean
curvature torus in a non-ﬂat two-dimensional complex space form is ﬂat and totally real.
Then, in Theorem 4.5, applying a result of Ohnita [19] or Urbano [22], we explicitly deter-
mine parallel mean curvature tori in the complex projective plane CP 2 and the complex
hyperbolic plane CH 2, endowed with their canonical structures of Kaehler surfaces.

We remark that parallel mean curvature spheres in CP 2 and CH 2 have been classiﬁed
by Hirakawa [14] and Fetcu [9]. Additional studies regarding parallel mean curvature
surfaces in various ambient spaces that are neither real nor complex space forms can be
found in Torralbo and Urbano [21], Fetcu and Rosenberg [10, 11, 12], and Ferreira and
Tribuzy [8].

In this paper, we ﬁrst study the local structure of a parallel mean curvature surface in
a two-dimensional complex space form using diﬀerent methods from those in our previous
works [16, 17]. The new ingredient in this paper is Lemma 2.4, which proves the existence
of special isothermal coordinates ﬁtting to the geometry of a parallel mean curvature

vector. Then, we determine explicitly the second fundamental form of the surface for
these coordinates. By coupling these results with generalised Hopf diﬀerentials found in
Ogata [18] and Fetcu [9], we prove our main results, Theorems 4.4 and 4.5.

2 Preliminaries

Let M [4ρ] be a complex two-dimensional complex space form with constant holomor-
phic sectional curvature 4ρ. Furthermore, let M be an oriented and connected real two-
dimensional Riemannian manifold with Gaussian curvature K and x : M −→ M [4ρ] be
an isometric immersion, with Kaehler angle α such that the mean curvature vector H is
nonzero and parallel for the normal connection on the normal bundle of the immersion.
We remark that the case with H = 0 has been studied in Chern and Wolfson [5] and
Eschenburg, Guadalupe, and Tribuzy [7].

Let M0 = {p ∈ M | x is neither holomorphic nor anti-holomorphic at p}. M0 is an
open dense subset of M. Because all of the calculations and formulas on M0 presented
in Ogata [18] are valid until page 400, according to the remark in Hirakawa [14], there
exists a local ﬁeld of unitary coframes {w1, w2} on M0 such that, by restricting it to x,
the Riemannian metric ds2 on M0 can be written as ds2 = φ ¯φ, where φ = cos α/2 · ω1 +
sin α/2· ¯ω2 . Let a and c be the complex valued functions on M0 that determine the second
fundamental form of x. Then, the Kaehler angle α and the complex 1-form φ satisfy

where (2.3) is the Gauss equation, (2.4) and (2.5) are the Codazzi-Mainardi equations,
and (2.6) is the Ricci equation of x.

Remark 2.1. (1) We remark sin α 6= 0 on M0.
(2) The unitary coframes {w1, w2} used in (2.1) ∼ (2.5) are uniquely determined up
to the orientations of both M[4ρ] and M0 (see [18]), hence the complex one-form φ on M0
is unique up to its sign and conjugacy.

Let us take an isothermal coordinate for the Riemannian metric φ ¯φ on M0 that makes

M0 a Riemann surface with a local complex coordinate z, and put

We will use the following facts that were proved in Ogata [18] and Fetcu [9].

Φ1 = (8ba − 3ρ sin2 α)φ2, Φ2 = ¯cφ2.

3

Lemma 2.2. The quadratic forms Φ1 and Φ2 on M0 are holomorphic.

For completeness, we will present a proof of Lemma 2.2. The quadratic forms Q and

Q′ on M in Fetcu [9] are written in our terminology as

(2.7)

Q = (8b(¯c + a) − 3ρ sin2 α)φ2, Q′ = (8b(¯c − a) + 3ρ sin2 α)φ2.

Let φ = λdz (λ 6= 0). By using (2.1) ∼ (2.5), we see that

d(λ2(8b(¯c + a) − 3ρ sin2 α)) ∧ φ = 0, d(λ2(8b(¯c − a) + 3ρ sin2 α)) ∧ φ = 0,

showing that both forms of (2.7) are holomorphic on M0. By taking both the addition
and the subtraction of the two forms of (2.7), we proved Lemma 2.2.

The local structure of the immersion satisfying a = ¯a on M0 has been determined in
Kenmotsu and Zhou [16] and Kenmotsu [17]. We remark that the classiﬁcation table of
those surfaces can also be found in Hirakawa [14]. By applying these results, we obtain
the following lemma.

Lemma 2.3. Let ρ 6= 0 and let x : M −→ M[4ρ] be an isometric immersion with a
non-zero parallel mean curvature vector. If a = ¯a on M0, then either K ≡ 0 on M and x
is totally real, or K ≤ −2b2 on M and x is not totally real.

Proof. If x is totally real, then α = π/2, so K = 0 on M0 by (2.1) and (2.3). By the
continuity of K, we have also K = 0 on M0 = M. Suppose that x is not totally real.
When ρ 6= 0, we have that ρ = −3b2 [16, 17], and by Theorem 2.1 (iii) in Hirakawa [14]
we have K ≤ −2b2. In fact, we see K = constant = −2b2 on M0 if α is constant, and
K = −2(2(a + b)2 + b2) ≤ −2b2 on M0 if α is not constant. By the continuity of K, we
proved Lemma 2.3.

From this point on, we will study an immersion satisfying dα 6= 0 and a 6= ¯a at a point
of M0. An immersion x is called a general type if it satisﬁes these two conditions on M0.
We proved in [17] that if x is of a general type, then a is a function of α, say a = a(α),

The following Lemma plays a fundamental role in this paper.

4

Lemma 2.4. Suppose that x is of a general type. Then, there is a coordinate trans-
formation w = w(z) on the Riemann surface M0 such that in φ = µdw, µ is a complex
valued function of the single real variable (w + ¯w)/2.

Proof. By (2.9), we have that αz ¯z/αz − F (α)α¯z = 0, which implies that the function
log αz −R F (α)dα is holomorphic for z. Hence, there exists a holomorphic function G(z)
such that αz = G(z) exp(R F (α)dα). We set w = R G(z)dz. Then, it follows from (2.1)

that φ = λdz = αz/(a(α) + b)dz = µdw, where we set

(2.11)

µ =

exp(cid:0)R F (α)dα(cid:1)

a(α) + b

.

We remark that µ is a complex valued function of α. Now, we prove that α is a function
of u, say α = α(u), where we set w = u + iv, (u, v ∈ R). In fact, by (2.1) and (2.11) we
can see that

(2.12)

dα = (a + b)µdw + (¯a + b)¯µd ¯w = 2 exp(cid:18)Z F (α)dα(cid:19) du,

because F (α) is real valued, which proves Lemma 2.4.

We note that the Kaehler angle α and the complex valued function µ are now functions
of a single real variable u for coordinates (u, v). It follows from (2.8), (2.10), and (2.11)
that

We can determine c as follows.

Lemma 2.5. Suppose that x is of a general type. Then, there is a real number k1 such

that

e−ik1v.

Proof. Set a(α) + b = |a(α) + b| exp iθ(α) and c = |c| exp iν(u, v), where θ(α) and
ν(u, v) are real valued functions of α and u and v respectively. By (2.11), the absolute
value and the argument of µ are functions of α and −θ(α) (mod 2π), respectively. Hence,
we have that

µ2¯c = |µ|2(α)|c|(α) exp i(−2θ(α) − ν(u, v)).

We note that θ = θ(α(u)) is a function of u only. Hence, the absolute value of µ2¯c is a
function of u only. Together with Lemma 2.2, this implies that

By the second equation above, we see that ν(u, v) = −2θ(α(u))+φ(v) for some real valued
function φ of v. By inserting this to the ﬁrst equation, we ﬁnd that there is a real number
k1 satisfying

(2.15)

d

du (cid:0)log(cid:0)|µ|2|c|(α(u)(cid:1)(cid:1) = k1, φ′(v) = −k1.

5

By the second formula of (2.15), we have that ν(u, v) = −2θ(α(u)) − k1v + k2 for some
k2 ∈ R. Because c is deﬁned up to a complex factor of norm 1, we may assume that
k2 = 0. Then, by the fact that (¯a + b)/(a + b) = exp(−2iθ), Lemma 2.5 is proved.

The constant k1 admits the following expression.

Lemma 2.6. Suppose that x is of a general type. Then, we have

(2.16)

2k1 = ρµ(cid:0)8|a|2 + 9b(a + ¯a) sin2 α − 8b2 + 18b2 sin2 α(cid:1)

(¯a + b)(cid:0)|a|2 + ρ/2(−2 + 3 sin2 α)(cid:1)

cot α.

Proof. By the ﬁrst equation of (2.15) and (2.6), we have

k1 =

It follows from (2.8), (2.11), (2.12), and (2.13) that (2.16) holds, proving Lemma 2.6.

Lemma 2.2 can be sharpened for the case of a general type.

Lemma 2.7. Suppose that x is of a general type. Then, there exist some constants

c1, c2 ∈ C such that
(2.17)

µ2(8ba − 3ρ sin2 α) = c1, µ2¯c = c2ek1ω.

Proof. By Lemma 2.2, µ2(8ba − 3ρ sin2 α) is a holomorphic function for ω. Since we
know µ = µ(α), a = a(α) and α = α(u), this is a function of u only, which implies the
ﬁrst formula of (2.17). By (2.11) and (2.14), the argument of µ2¯c is k1v and by the ﬁrst
formula of (2.15), its absolute value is c2ek1u, which proves Lemma 2.7.

3 The case with k1 = 0

In this section, we study the case with k1 = 0. The main result of this section is used to
prove the main theorems of this paper. Let us recall assumptions to be applied in this
section. These are that ρ 6= 0, a + b 6= 0, c 6= 0, sin α 6= 0, and k1 = 0.

By (2.16), we have

(3.1)

8|a(α)|2 + 9b(a(α) + a(α)) sin2 α − 8b2 + 18b2 sin2 α = 0.

By taking the derivative of (3.1) for α and using (2.8), we have that (ρ + 3b2)(|a(α)|2−
b2) = 0. If |a(α)|2 = b2 on M0, then we have by (3.1) that a(α) + a(α) = −2b, and so
(a(α) + b)(a(α) + b) = 0 on M0, which contradicts the assumptions applied in this section.
Hence, we have that

(3.2)

ρ = −3b2.

By considering (2.14) with k1 = 0, we note that c is a function of u only, because α = α(u).
In order to determine a(α) explicitly, we set

(3.3)

w =

a(α) − b
a(α) + b

.

(1 − w)2(1 − ¯w) sin α cos α = 0,

and 18 sin2 α + (8 − 9 sin2 α)(w + ¯w) = 0, respectively. Hence, the real part of w is
uniquely determined, and the imaginary part of w, say y(α), satisﬁes the ﬁrst order
ordinary diﬀerential equation

The solution of (3.4) is given by

(3.5)

y2(α) =

8c1

(8 − 9 sin2 α)(−c1 + sin2 α) ≥ 0,

(c1 ∈ R),

where the integral constant c1 satisﬁes c1 6= 0 and 8 − 9c1 6= 0. In fact, if c1 = 0, then
y(α) identically vanishes, hence a = ¯a on M0, which contradicts the assumption a 6= ¯a.
If 8 − 9c1 = 0, then y2 < 0, giving a contradiction. Since the right hand of (3.5) is
non-negative, it holds that

(3.6)

(cid:26) 0 < c1 < sin2 α < 8

9, or 8
9 < sin2 α ≤ 1, for c1 < 0.

8

9 < sin2 α < c1, for c1 > 0,

Later, we will use the explicit formula of a. By (3.3) and (3.5), the real part of a(α),
ℜa(α), is given by

(−16c1 + (8 + 27c1) sin2 α − 18 sin4 α)

ℜa(α) =

8 − 9c1

and also, the imaginary part of a(α), ℑa(α), is given by, when c1 > 0,

(3.8)

ℑa(α) =

(8 − 9 sin2 α)p(8 − 9 sin2 α)(−c1 + sin2 α)

sin2 α

,

b√c1

√2(8 − 9c1)
b√c2

and when c1 < 0, setting c2 = −c1 > 0,

(3.9)

ℑa(α) =

√2(8 + 9c2)

(9 sin2 α − 8)p(9 sin2 α − 8)(c2 + sin2 α)

sin2 α

,

where sin α satisﬁes (3.6). We note that by (3.5), (3.8) and (3.9), those intervals in (3.6)
are the maximal ones of sin2 α on which ℑa(α) does not vanish. We compute the Gaussian
curvature of M0 as follows: B (3.1) and (3.3), we have

|a(α)|2 = b2 1 + (w + ¯w) + |w|2

1 − (w + ¯w) + |w|2 , w = −

9 sin2 α
8 − 9 sin2 α

+ iy(α)

By these formulas above, (2.3) and (3.5), we have

(3.10)

K = −2b2

(8 − 9c1) (cid:16)(cid:0)9 sin2 α − 8(cid:1)2

+ (8 − 9c1)(cid:17) ,

which proves the following Lemma 3.1

7

Lemma 3.1. If 8 − 9c1 > 0, then the Gaussian curvature K is upper bounded by a

negative constant on M0, that is, it holds that K ≤ −2b2 < 0 on M .

Hence, we have proved part of the following theorem
Theorem 3.2. Let ρ 6= 0, and let x : M −→ M [4ρ] be an isometric immersion
with a non-zero parallel mean curvature vector of a general type. If k1 = 0, then ρ =
−3b2, and the ﬁrst and second fundamental forms of x are explicitly determined by
(2.11), (2.14), (3.7), (3.8), (3.9), and a real number c1. In particular, the Gaussian cur-
vature K is bounded above by −2b2 when 8 − 9c1 > 0. Conversely, for b > 0, there is a
one-parameter family of parallel mean curvature immersions of a general type with k1 = 0
from a simply connected domain D in R2 into M [−12b2], with |H| = 2b.

Proof of the converse: For given b > 0 and c1 ∈ R, we can ﬁnd a simply connected
domain D with coordinates (u, v), a real valued function α = α(u), complex valued
functions a = a(α) and c = c(α), and a complex one form φ on D, by considering (3.3),
(3.5), and (2.14) with k1 = 0. Then, we can prove that these functions satisfy the structure
equations (2.1) ∼ (2.6), and that c1 is the parameter of the family. We omit a detailed
computation of the proof, because the converse is not used in this paper.

Remark 3.3. The case with k1 6= 0 remains to be studied. This will be addressed in

future work, because the study of this case is not necessary for the present paper.

4 Parallel mean curvature tori

In this section, we suppose that M is homeomorphic to a torus, and we denote it by T2.
Let T2
0 = {p ∈ T2 | x is neither holomorphic nor anti-holomorphic at p}. First, we study
the case of a = ¯a on T2
0.

Lemma 4.1. Let ρ 6= 0 and let x : T2 −→ M [4ρ] be an isometric immersion with a
0. Then,

non-zero parallel mean curvature vector. Suppose that x satisﬁes a = ¯a on T2
K = 0 on T2 and x is totally real.

presents a contradiction by the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, proving Lemma 4.1.

Proof. By Lemma 2.3, if x is not totally real, then K ≤ −2b2 on T2. However this
From now on, we suppose that a 6= ¯a at some point of T2
0. In particular, we have
8ba − 3ρ sin2 α 6= 0 at the point of T2
0, hence by Lemma 2.7 c1 6= 0 and Φ1 is a non-zero
quadratic form on T2
0, hence Q − Q′ is a non-zero holomorphic quadratic form on T2 by
2.7 and Fetcu [9]. By Riemann-Roch’s Theorem, the dimension of the vector space over
C of holomorphic quadratic forms on a torus is one, and Q − Q′ is a base of the vector
space. Hence, the holomporphic quadratic form Q + Q′ on T2 is a constant multiple of
Q − Q′. By Lemma 2.7, we have
(4.1)

µ2¯c = constant, and k1 = 0.

By taking the ratio of the two formulas of (2.17), we have that for some γ(6= 0) ∈ C,
(4.2)

on T2
0.

8ba − 3ρ sin2 α − bγ¯c = 0

We have

0. We take the absolute

0, then |γ|2 = 2(8 − 9c1) > 0.

Then, by (3.2) and (4.2) we have that 8a(α) + 9b sin2 α = γ¯c on T2
value of the formula above and then we use (2.6) and (3.1) to get

4b(8 − 9 sin2 α)2 = |γ|2(−9 sin2 αℜa(α) + 16b − 27b sin2 α),

and by (3.7) we get (8 − 9 sin2 α)2(|γ|2 − 2(8 − 9c1)) = 0. If |γ|2 − 2(8 − 9c1) 6= 0, then
8 − 9 sin2 α = 0 on T2, which implies α = constant on T2, so a = ¯a on T2
0, giving a
contradiction. We proved Lemma 4.2.

Lemma 4.3. It holds that a = ¯a on T2
0.
Proof. Let U = {p ∈ T2

0 | a 6= ¯a at p}. Suppose that U is non-empty. We note
that, by Theorem 3.2 and Lemma 4.2, K is upper bounded by a negative constant on
U. If U = T2
0, then we have a contradiction by the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem. From now
on, we consider the case that there is a point p0 ∈ T2
0 with a = ¯a at p0. For c1 > 0, by
(3.8), ℑa tends to zero if and only if sin2 α tends to c1 or 8/9. Therefore, for the case of
c1 > 0, (c1, 8/9) is the maximal interval of sin2 α satisfying a 6= ¯a. For the case of c1 < 0,
the similar consideration proves that (8/9, 1) is the maximal interval of sin2 α satisfying
a 6= ¯a. We have 0 < sin2 α(p0) ≤ c1 or 8/9 ≤ sin2 α(p0). If sin2 α(p0) < c1, then there is
an open neighborhood W of p0 such that sin2 α < c1 on W . Since we have a = ¯a on W ,
it holds that K ≤ −2b2 at p0 by Lemma 2.3. For the case of 8/9 < sin2 α(p0), the similar
consideration as before implies also K ≤ −2b2 on the point of a = ¯a. Therefore, for those
points p ∈ T2
0 satisfying a(p) = ¯a(p), K is also upper bounded by a negative constant.
We proved that K is upper bounded above by a negative constant on both sets U and
T2
0 \ U, which contradicts the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem by taking the integral of K over
T2. Hence, we proved Lemma 4.3.
By Lemmas 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, we proved the following main result of this paper:
Theorem 4.4. Let ρ 6= 0, and let x : T2 −→ M[4ρ] be an isometric immersion with
a non-zero parallel mean curvature vector. Then, the Gaussian curvature of T2 vanishes
identically and x is totally real.

Let CP n and CH n be the complex projective space and complex hyperbolic space,
respectively, endowed with Kaehler metrics of constant holomorphic sectional curvature.
In Ohnita [19], and also independently in Urbano [22], n-dimensional totally real sub-
manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature in CP n and CH n have been classiﬁed
in the context of the theory of symmetric spaces. For the ﬂat case, these immersions
are explicitly described in Dajczer and Tojeiro [6] when the ambient space is CP n, and
Hirakawa [13] when the ambient space is CH 2. By combining Theorem 4.4 with those
results, we determined tori with non-zero parallel mean curvature in two-dimensional
non-ﬂat complex space forms. For completeness, we state the following as a theorem

Theorem 4.5. Let T2 be a real two-dimensional compact orientable Riemannian man-
ifold with genus one. Then, an isometric immersion from T2 into CP 2 or CH 2 has a
non-zero parallel mean curvature vector if and only if the image is a totally real ﬂat torus
in CP 2 or CH 2, respectively.
