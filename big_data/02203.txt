Abstract

NMSSM has enough ingredients to explain the diphoton excess at 750 GeV: singlet-like
(pseudo) scalar (a) s and higgsinos as heavy vector-like fermions. We consider the production
of the 750 GeV singlet-like pseudo scalar a from a decay of the doublet-like pseudo scalar A,
and the subsequent decay of a into two photons via higgsino loop. We demonstrate that this
cascade decay of the NMSSM Higgs bosons can explain the diphoton excess in the 13 TeV data
consistently with the absence of a signiﬁcant excess in the 8 TeV data.

1 Introduction

Recently ATLAS and CMS have reported excesses in the diphoton mass distribution around
mγγ (cid:39) 750 GeV in their 13 TeV data [1, 2]. The local signiﬁcance assuming narrow width is
∼ 3.6 σ for ATLAS and ∼ 2.6 σ for CMS. Fitting the excess with a narrow resonance around
750 GeV yields the cross section times branching ratio of σ13TeV · BRγγ (cid:39) 2.5 ÷ 8 fb at 1 σ.
On the other hand, in 8 TeV data ATLAS and CMS did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant excesses in this
region [3, 4], although CMS found a slight excess at mγγ (cid:39) 750 GeV. The most stringent limit
comes from the CMS search [4] and σ8TeV · BRγγ < 1.32 fb (95 % CL).

The possible interpretation and implications of the excess has been intensively studied.
Most such studies introduce new particles to account for the excess without asking about their
UV origin, and interpretation within the known models in particular Minimal Supersymmetric
Starndard Model (MSSM) and Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) is
rare.1 In this paper we study the possibility to explain the diphoton excess within the framework
of NMSSM without introducing additional particles.

One of the most straightforward interpretations of the excess is to consider a 750 GeV
resonance, X, decaying to two photons: αβ → X → γγ, where α, β are the initial state
partons.
If the initial partons are gluons, ab = gg, the 8 TeV CMS limit mentioned above
translates to σ13TeV · BRγγ < 6.4 fb, leading to a slight tension with the 13 TeV best ﬁt value
2.5 ÷ 8 fb. This tension is relaxed if the initial partons are b-quarks, αβ = b¯b. If the model
is renormalizable, X → γγ suggests the existence of vector-like fermions (or scalars) coupled
to X [9–54], which generate the eﬀective operator XF µνFµν( ˜Fµν). Such fermions should be
heavier than mX/2 (cid:39) 375 GeV, otherwise the diphoton rate is strongly suppressed because
X predominantly decays into the vector-like fermions on shell. Similar argument strongly
disfavours the possibility to identify X as the heavy higgs bosons in the MSSM or 2HDM,
because in such models X predominantly decays into t¯t and/or b¯b [55].

Another possibility is to consider the production of X from a decay of a heavy resonance
Yr associated with another particle Yd: αβ → Yr → YdX, X → γγ [9, 56, 57]. This topology
has two advantages. First, the mass of Yr has to be larger than mX (cid:39) 750 GeV, and the 13
TeV production cross section of Yr is more enhanced with respect to the 8 TeV cross section,
compared to the previous topology, relaxing the tension between 8 and 13 TeV data. Second,
BR(X → γγ) is independent of the production cross section of the resonance. This is not
the case for the previous topology, because a large production cross section leads to a large
rate of the inverse decay process X → αβ, which suppresses BR(X → γγ). This topology
can be relatively easily realised in the NMSSM by identifying Yr = A, Yd = s and X = a:
αβ → A → sa, a → γγ, as shown in Fig. 1, where A is the doublet-like pseudo scalar and (a)
s is the singlet-like (pseudo) scalar. The Yd = h is disfavoured because non-zero Aha coupling
requires doublet-singlet mixing in the pseudo-scalar sector (Aa mixing), suppressing a → γγ
branching ratio. In our scenario, s predominantly decays into b¯b through a mixing with H.

Figure 1: An NMSSM Higgs boson cascade decay contributing to the diphoton excess. The α and β
denote the initial state partons. If (α, β) = (b¯b), one also expects extra b jets in the forward region.

Although the current data would not have enough sensitivity to discriminate these extra jets
from other jets with QCD origin, this scenario can be tested by looking at these b-jets in the
future analysis.

The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we demonstrate our scenario in a simpliﬁed
framework in which the mixing between singlet and doublet states are ignored. In section 3
we consider how our scenario can be realised in the NMSSM taking the eﬀect of mixing into
account. We conclude this paper in section 4.

2 Interpretation with pure states

We ﬁrst discuss our scenario in a simpliﬁed framework where the resonance A is pure doublet
state and the lightest CP even and odd Higgs bosons, s and a, are exclusively originated from
the singlet ﬁeld S. In order to explain the diphoton excess, the cross section and branching
ratios should satisfy

(σ · BR)signal

13TeV ≡ σ13TeV(pp → A) · BR(A → sa) · BR(a → γγ) = 2.5 ÷ 8 fb ,

at 1 σ level. On the other hand, the 8 TeV CMS 95 % CL limit [4] reads

(σ · BR)signal

8TeV ≡ σ8TeV(pp → A) · BR(A → sa) · BR(a → γγ) < 1.32 fb .

The cross sections are calculated using SusHi v.1.5.0 [58–65]. As can be seen, the

It can be as large as 400 (200) fb for tan β = 50 (30) at mA ∼ 850 GeV. The cross section

enhances from 8 TeV to 13 TeV by factor of 5 for gg and 6.7 for b¯b initial states. We impose

forbidden.

|gAsa|/(246 GeV). At a ﬁxed gAsa, BR(A → sa) is maximised around tan β ∼ 7. This is because
the decay rate of A → f ¯f is minimised in this region. For small ( <∼ 2) and large ( >∼ 30) tan β,
|gAsa|/(246 GeV) >∼ 1.5 is required to have BR(A → sa) >∼ 0.3.
We focus on the process in which a decays to two photons through higgsino loop. If a is
pure singlet and the gauginos are decoupled, BR(a → γγ) does not depend on the higgsino
mass nor the a˜h+˜h− coupling, and is entirely determined by quantum numbers of higgsinos.
The branching ratios are given as
BR(a → W +W −) ≈ 0.65, BR(a → ZZ) ≈ 0.23, BR(a → γZ) ≈ 0.05, BR(a → γγ) ≈ 0.07.
(6)
We now combine the cross section and branching ratios to see if the model can ﬁt the 13
TeV excess consistently with the 8 TeV limit. The result is summarised in Fig. 4. The blue
region represents 1 σ favoured region by the 13 TeV excess, 2.5 < (σ · BR)signal
13TeV/fb < 8, whilst
the grey region is disfavoured at 95 %CL by the 8 TeV constraint, (σ · BR)signal
8TeV > 1.32 fb. We
also show the 1 σ favoured region by a small excess observed in the CMS 8 TeV data by the
green regions, 0.3 < (σ · BR)signal
8TeV /fb < 1. Some part of the blue and green regions overlap
(dark green). As can be seen, there exist two favoured regions, (a) small ( <∼ 2) tan β region
and (b) large ( >∼ 20) tan β region. This is because the production cross section, pp → A, is
maximised for these two regions. In the small tan β region gg → A via the top-quark loop
dominates the production processes, whereas b¯b → A is dominant in the large tan β region.
The enhancement in the cross section compensates the slight suppression in BR(A → sa) (see
Fig. 3). For moderate tan β, the signal event rate cannot be large enough due to the small
cross section even for |gAsa|/(246 GeV) >∼ 1.5 where the BR(A → sa) is already saturated
BR(A → sa) ∼ 1 and increasing gAsa further does not help to enhance the signal rate. As can

be seen, both favoured regions require relatively large gAsa coupling. For large and small tan β
regions, the 1 σ region requires |gAsa|/(246 GeV) >∼ 1 and 2, respectively.
In this simpliﬁed framework, the dominant decay mode of s becomes s → γγ because other
gauge boson ﬁnal states are not kinematically allowed. This will cause a strong tension with the
fact that ATLAS and CMS did not observe extra photons other than the diphoton excess with
mγγ (cid:39) 750 GeV. However, this problem can be easily circumvented by introducing a mixing
between s and H. With this mixing s will dominantly decay into b¯b.

In the previous section we have shown that |gAsa/vSM| >∼ 1 (2) is required for tan β >∼ 20
( <∼ 2) (See Fig. 4.). Clearly, one needs the product |λκ| >∼ 1(2) for large (small) tan β to
explain the excess. Such large values of λ and/or κ indicates the Landau pole at the scale µUV
much below the GUT scale. In Fig. 5 we show the constraint from the Landau pole. If our
topology is responsible for the observed diphoton excess, this indicates the existence of the UV
cut-oﬀ typically of the order of 100 TeV.

Those mixings must respect various phenomenological constraints, such as the e+e− → Z∗ →
Zs (s → b¯b) process from the LEP and the property of the 125 GeV Higgs boson measured at
the LHC. The LEP limit on the e+e− → Z∗ → Zs (s → b¯b) process for the 65 GeV scalar gives
<∼ 0.37 · BR(s → b¯b) [68], where BR(s → b¯b) depends in principle on H-s
the bound sin 2θhs
mixing and tan β [69]. The measurement for the SM-like Higgs boson at the LHC also gives
the constraints on the mixing angles. The deviation of the coupling to the gauge bosons is now
constrained up to ∼ 20 % at 95 % CL [70,71]. This translates into the constraint on the mixing
angles as sin 2θHh, sin 2θhs

<∼ 0.4 independently from the H-s mixing.

Clearly, the values of the Higgs boson masses and the constraints on the mixing angles would
select some regions of the NMSSM parameter space. However, the complexity of the NMSSM

9

Higgs potential and the lack of knowledge on the exact forms of radiative corrections make a
full quantitative analysis of our scenario very challenging and premature. We note that some of
the radiative correction terms are proportional to the 3rd power of λ or κ and can be as large

as the tree level terms for |λ|, |κ| >∼ 1 [72]. The 2-loop corrections may also be large in this

region. Merely for the illustration purpose, we attempt to ﬁnd the NMSSM parameters that
satisfy the above conditions using approximate forms of the 1-loop radiative corrections. For
large λ and κ, neglecting the corrections proportional to the gauge and Yukawa couplings, the
leading terms of the radiative corrections to the oﬀ-diagonal mass matrix elements are given by

For mH = mA = 850 GeV, ms = 65 GeV and µ = 375 GeV, demanding sin 2θAa = 0 = M 2

there are several solutions. For instance, for tan β = 20 and |gAsa| = 1 we found λ = 0.72,
κ = −1.72, Aλ = 1.53 TeV, µ(cid:48) = 1.66 TeV, sin 2θHs = −0.95, sin 2θHh = 0.002. Also,
for tan β = 2 and |gAsa| = 2 we found λ = −κ = 1.4, Aλ = 0.39 TeV, µ(cid:48) = 0.57 TeV,
sin 2θHs = −0.32, sin 2θHh = 0.07. The Hh mixing is always small. The above numbers
illustrate the expected order of magnitude for the soft mass parameters and indicate that this
scenario will be ﬁne-tuned at the level of 1 per mille.

4 Conclusions
We demonstrate that the plain NMSSM can explain the observed diphoton excess at mγγ (cid:39) 750
GeV as a decay of a single particle into two photons at the price of a relatively low UV cut-oﬀ
(around 100 TeV) and of a certain ﬁne tuning of the parameters. The mechanism behind this
scenario is production of a doublet-like pseudo scalar A, decaying into a singlet-like pseudo
scalar a, which subsequently decays via the vector-like higgsino loop into two photons. The
predicted width of a is very small, much below the experimental resolution. The two-photon
signal should be associated with b-quark jets coming from the decay A → as, with s decaying
dominantly into a pair of b quarks. The pseudo scalar a decays also into other channels with
the branching ratios given by Eq. (6).

The topology proposed in this paper is the only one that can explain the 750 GeV excess in

10

the plain NMSSM due to a single particle decay. Another possibility for the NMSSM, recently
proposed, is to explain the observed signal by the decays of two light pseudo scalars, to two
collimated photons each. The latter interpretation could explain a broad peak at 750 GeV, if
conﬁrmed experimentally. The width of the signal will give a crucial discrimination between
diﬀerent proposed interpretations, in particular between perturbative and non-perturbative
scenarios.
