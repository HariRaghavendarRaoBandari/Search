PT symmetry, that is, a combined parity and time-reversal symmetry is a key milestone for
non-Hermite systems exhibiting entirely real eigenenergy.
In the present work, motivated by a
recent experiment, we study PT symmetry of the time-evolution operator of non-unitary quantum
walks. We present the explicit deﬁnition of PT symmetry by employing a concept of symmetry
time frames. We provide a necessary and suﬃcient condition so that the time-evolution operator
of non-unitary quantum walks retains PT symmetry even when parameters of the model depend
on position.
It is also shown that there exist extra symmetries embedded in the time-evolution
operator. Applying these results, we clarify that the non-unitary quantum walk in the experiment
does have PT symmetry.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum mechanics requires that, in a closed system,
physical observables be represented by Hermitian opera-
tors. The Hamiltonian of the system is no exception to
this rule. However, the closed system is an ideal con-
cept and, rigorously speaking, almost systems in the real
world, except a whole universe, should have ﬂow of en-
ergy and particles to outer environments, which makes
the Hamiltonian of the inner system non-Hermitian. Fur-
thermore, it is widely accepted to phenomenologically
include non-Hermite eﬀects into Hamiltonians when we
treat eﬀects of ampliﬁcation and dissipation, namely,
gain and loss,
in open systems. For example, non-
Hermitian Hamiltonians are employed to describe the ra-
dioactive decay[1], the depinning of ﬂux lines in type-II
superconductors[2], and so on[3]. In general, such a non-
Hermitian Hamiltonian has complex eigenenergy which
makes systematic controls of the dynamics diﬃcult.

In 1998, however, Bender and Boettcher clariﬁed that a
broad class of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can have en-
tirely real eigenenergy if the system possesses a combined
parity symmetry and time-reversal symmetry (TRS),
that is, PT symmetry[4–6]. If the Hamiltonian possesses
PT symmetry and its eigenstates are also eigenstates
of the PT symmetry operator, then, this is a suﬃcient
condition for the eigenenergy being real. Applying this
property, moreover, PT symmetry in the non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian provides a procedure to selectively induce
complex eigenenergy for speciﬁc eigenstates[7–9]. For
systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with
PT symmetry, a large number of novel phenomena,
which can not be observed in Hermitian systems, have
been predicted theoretically. For example, the system
with PT symmetric periodic structures can act as unidi-
rectional invisible media[10, 11], edge states having com-
plex eigenenergy emerge[12, 13], Bloch oscillations with
unique features occur[14], and others[15–22]. These re-
sults open a way to engineer non-Hermite systems to
utilize as novel platforms of applications. The system
with PT symmetry has been realized in optics by us-

ing coupled optical waveguides with ﬁne tuned complex
refractive index[23, 24]. It has been also demonstrated
that coupled microcavity resonators realize PT symmet-
ric systems[25, 26]. Recently, the mode-selective lasing
by utilizing PT symmetry has been realized based on
microring resonators[27, 28]. However, due to diﬃculty
to handle gain and loss eﬀects, the experimental systems
are limited to a small number of elements.

In contrast, there is a unique way to experimentally
perform large scale PT symmetric systems with high tun-
ability, that is, the discrete-time quantum walk[29, 30].
The discrete-time quantum walk (quantum walk,
in
short) is the model recently attracting attention as ver-
satile platforms for quantum computations and quan-
tum simulators. The quantum walk describes quan-
tum dynamics of particles by a time-evolution opera-
tor,
instead of a Hamiltonian. The quantum walks
have been realized in various experimental setups, such
as cold atoms[31], trapped ions[32, 33], and optical
systems[34–38]. Since quantum walks enable high tun-
ability of the system setup, various phenomena which
require delicate setups have been observed, such as An-
derson localization[39, 40], scattering with positive- and
negative-mass pulses[41], emergence of edge states which
stem from topological phases[42], and so on.

Remarkably, in 2012, a quantum walk by optical-ﬁbre
loops, where additional optical ampliﬁers make it pos-
sible to control the eﬀects of gain and loss was exper-
imentally implemented[43]. Due to gain and loss, the
time-evolution operator of this quantum walk becomes
non-unitary, which can be considered that the eﬀective
Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian. Nevertheless, it has been
shown that the system has entirely real (quasi-)energy
in proper setups. Furthermore, interesting phenomena
peculiar to PT symmetry, such as unidirectional invis-
ible transport[43], extraordinary Bloch oscillations[43],
optical solitons[44, 45], have been observed. These re-
sults provide convincing evidence that the system pos-
sesses PT symmetry. However, PT symmetry and the
PT symmetry operator have not yet been directly iden-
tiﬁed from the time-evolution operator itself, since the

deﬁnition of PT symmetry on the time-evolution opera-
tor has not been established so far. It is an urgent and
important task to identify the explicit deﬁnition of PT
symmetry for further developments.
In the present work, we provide the explicit deﬁni-
tion of the PT symmetry operator and identify that the
time evolution operator of the non-unitary quantum walk
in the experiment has, indeed, PT symmetry. This is
archived for the ﬁrst time by employing a concept of sym-
metry time frames[46] which has been developed in the
recent study of topological phases of quantum walks[46–
50]. We also show that the time-evolution operator of the
non-unitary quantum walk has extra symmetries. Fur-
thermore, we provide the necessary and suﬃcient condi-
tions for PT and other symmetries of the time-evolution
operator even when parameters of the model are position
dependent. Taking account of these results, we present
inhomogeneous non-unitary quantum walk with PT sym-
metry.
This paper is organized as follows. We deﬁne the time-
evolution operator of the non-unitary quantum walk in
Sec.
II. Section III is devoted to present how to de-
ﬁne and identify PT symmetry and extra symmetries
of the time-evolution operator of the non-unitary quan-
tum walk. This is our main result of the present work.
In Sec. IV, as applications of the result obtained in the
previous section, we identify PT symmetry of the time-
evolution operator of the non-unitary quantum walk in
the experiment[43] and, further, demonstrate a PT sym-
metric inhomogeneous non-unitary quantum walk. The
summary and discussions are given in Sec. V.

FIG. 1. (Color online) (a)Experimental setup. Optical pulses
corresponding to walkers go around in two optical-ﬁbre loops
with diﬀerent circumferences, and they are split into two at
the connected point (shown by a rectangle) corresponding to
coin operators. After a single cycle, pulses are delayed or
advanced in time due to the diﬀerence of lengths of two ﬁbre
loops, corresponding to shift operators. The time-evolution of
the single time-step is composed of the following two substeps.
At the former half of the step, amplitudes of pulses passing
through the long (short) loop are ampliﬁed (dumped) and, at
the latter half of the step, vice verse. (b)Translation from the
above description to the standard schematic view of the 1D
two-step quantum walk. When a pulse passes the long (short)
loop and it is delayed (advanced) in time, this is interpreted
as that the walker ”shifts to right (left)”.

Figure 1 shows the schematic view of the experimental
setup of the non-unitary quantum walk implemented by
the two optical-ﬁbre loops in Ref. [43]. As explained in
the caption, the system is interpreted as one-dimensional
(1D) two-step quantum walks. Motivated by the exper-
iment, we deﬁne a time-evolution operator of the non-
unitary quantum walk with gain and loss in more gen-
eral fashion. At ﬁrst, we introduce the time-evolution
operator of the 1D two-step unitary quantum walk, and
then extend it to the non-unitary one. We introduce the
basis of the walker’s 1D position space |ni and internal
states |Li = (1, 0)T ,|Ri = (0, 1)T where the subscript
T denotes the transpose. The symbols L, R represent
walker’s internal states, say, left mover and right mover
components, respectively. The time-evolution operator
of the two-step unitary quantum walk Uu is deﬁned as

Uu = S C(θ2) S C(θ1).

Since ˜C(θi,n) acts on the internal states of walkers, the
coin operator C(θi) mixes the walker’s internal states.
The shift operator S changes the position of walkers de-
pending on the internal states. Note that, in the present
work, we follow a rule that an operator with a tilde (˜)
on the top acts on space of internal states of walkers.

With an initial state |ψ(0)i, the wave function after t

time step is described as

|ψ(t)i = U t|ψ(0)i = Xn,σ=L,R

ψn,σ(t)|ni ⊗ |σi.

From the eigenvalue equation, we deﬁne the quasi-energy
ε as

U|Ψλi = λ|Ψλi, λ = e−iε,

Here, the coin operator C(θi=1,2) and the shift operator
S are standard elemental operators of quantum walks

where |Ψλi is the eigenvector with the eigenvalue λ. For
the unitary quantum walk, λ should satisfy |λ| = 1 and
then ε should be real with 2π periodicity.

III. PT AND EXTRA SYMMETRIES OF THE

NON-UNITARY QUANTUM WALK

In this section, we identify various symmetries embed-
ded in the time-evolution operator of the non-unitary
quantum walk in Eq. (3). Among them, our main tar-
get is PT symmetry, which can restrict the quasi-energy
of the non-unitary quantum walk to real number. To
begin with, let us summarize argument on PT symme-
try of Hamiltonians[4].
In order to deﬁne PT symme-
try, we consider parity symmetry and TRS at ﬁrst. For
a system described by a (Hermitian or non-Hermitian)
Hamiltonian H, it is required that the Hamiltonian sat-
isﬁes following relations to retain parity symmetry and
TRS:

(6)

PHP −1 = H,
T HT −1 = H,

(7)
respectively. Here, the parity symmetry operator P,
which ﬂips the sign of position from n to −n, is a uni-
tary operator and does not include complex conjugate
K. The TRS operator T , which inverts the direction of
time from t to −t, is an anti-unitary operator including
K. By combing Eqs. (6) and (7), PT symmetry of the
Hamiltonian is deﬁned as

(PT )H(PT )−1 = H,

(8)
where the combined symmetry operator PT is the anti-
unitary operator.
When the Hamiltonian satisﬁes both Eqs. (6) and (7),
the relation for PT symmetry (8) is automatically satis-
ﬁed. However, even when the Hamiltonian have neither
parity symmetry [Eq. (6)] nor TRS [Eq. (7)], it could
satisfy Eq. (8) to establish PT symmetry. This recover-
ing of PT symmetry becomes much important in the
case of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, since one of the
standard ways to phenomenologically include eﬀects of
gain and loss is adding non-Hermite imaginary potential
terms into a Hermitian Hamiltonian, which prevents to
retain TRS in Eq. (7) due to complex conjugation K. In
addition to the presence of PT symmetry of the non-
Hermitian Hamiltonian, we demand that eigenvectors of
the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian are also eigenvectors of
the PT symmetry operator,

H|Ψλi = Eλ|Ψλi, PT |Ψλi = eiδ|Ψλi,

(9)

FIG. 2. (Color online) An example of the one time step of
time evolutions described by the time-evolution operator U
with the initial state |ψ(0)i = |0, Li. The left (right) mover
components are depicted as waves in dashed (solid) curves.
At each time step, on a site n, the left (right) mover compo-
nent ψn,L(R)(t) is varied to the linear combination of ψn,L(t)
and ψn,R(t) by the coin operator C(θi). Then, left mover
components ψn,L(t) move to left and right mover components
ψn,R(t) move to right by the shift operator S. During walkers
change their positions, they are aﬀected by gain or loss of the
amplitude and phase modulation, that is, ψn,σ(t) increase or
decrease by the factor gi,σ(n) by the gain/loss operator Gi,
and earn the phase φi,σ(n) by the phase operator Φi.

The unitary quantum walk described by Uu can be

extended to the non-unitary one described by

U = S G2 Φ2 C(θ2) S G1 Φ1 C(θ1).

(3)

Here, we introduce additional elemental operators; the
gain/loss operator Gi and the phase operator Φi deﬁned
as

Gi =Xn
Φi =Xn

|nihn| ⊗ ˜Gi,n, ˜Gi,n =(cid:18) gi,L(n)
|nihn| ⊗ ˜Φi,n, ˜Φi,n =(cid:18) eiφi,L(n)

0

0

0

gi,R(n)(cid:19) ,
eiφi,R(n) (cid:19) ,

0

(4)

(5)

respectively. The gain/loss operator Gi multiplies the
wave function amplitude ψn,σ(t) by the factor gi,σ(n). If
gi,σ(n) 6= 1, then Gi and U become non-unitary opera-
tors. The phase operator Φi adds the phase φi,σ(n) to
that of the wave function amplitude ψn,σ(t). The time-
evolution of a walker described by U is schematically ex-
plained in Fig. 2. Thereby, the time-evolution operator
of the non-unitary quantum walk contains three kinds of
n dependent parameters, θi(n), gi,σ(n), and φi,σ(n). The
setup in the experiment in Ref. [43] is realized with the
parameters in Eq. (39), as we discuss in Sec. IV.

where the phase δ is a real number. Satisfying both con-
ditions Eqs. (8) and (9) establishes the suﬃcient condi-
tion that the eigenenergy Eλ is kept to be a real number
even for the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Hereafter, we
apply the above argument to the time-evolution operator
of non-unitary quantum walks.

A. Symmetries in homogeneous systems

For simplicity, at ﬁrst, we assume the homogeneous
non-unitary quantum walk in which all parameters have

no position n dependences, so that we can treat operators
in momentum space by applying the Fourier transforma-
tion.

In the homogeneous systems, the operators, C(θi), Gi,
and Φi, are diagonal in the momentum representation,
and we can drop the subscript n from ˜C(θi,n), ˜Gi,n, and
˜Φi,n. For further simpliﬁcation, we assume

˜G2 = ˜G−1

1 = ˜G =(cid:18) eγ
˜Φ2 = ˜Φ1 = ˜Φ =(cid:18) eiφ

of ˜G2 = ˜G−1
is motivated by the setup of the
1
experiment[43] as shown in Eqs. (39b) and (39c).] By
using the Pauli matrix σ1, the coin operator is also writ-
ten as

We remark that, while ηk is always real, ξk becomes imag-
inary when d2
3. Figure 3 shows the quasi-energy
as a function of k with speciﬁc parameters for exam-
ples. We see that the quasi-energy becomes entirely real
even for the ﬁnite γ (non-unitary time-evolution opera-
tor). Note that this is not accidental, but occurs in wide
parameter regions as long as the absolute value of the
right hand side in Eq. (15) does not exceed one, which is
consistent with the condition to keep ξk real. This result
suggests the presence of PT symmetry, as Ref. [43] has
shown. In addition, from Eq. (15), we also understand
that the quasi-energy becomes symmetric with respect to
ε = 0. Indeed, these properties can be understood from
symmetries embedded in the non-unitary time-evolution
operator in Eq. (14).

˜C(θi) =(cid:18) cos[θi] i sin[θi]

cos[θi] (cid:19) = eiθiσ1 .

i sin[θi]

(12)

We introduce the parity symmetry and TRS operators,
P and T , in the position and momentum representations
as follows;

With the Fourier transformation, the shift operator in
Eq. (2) can be rewritten as

S =Xk

|kihk| ⊗ ˜S(k), ˜S(k) =(cid:18) e+ik

0

0

e−ik (cid:19) = eikσ3 ,

(13)

where k stands for the wave number. Accordingly, the
time-evolution operator U in Eq. (3) in the momentum
representation is written down as

U =Xk

|kihk| ⊗ ˜U (k),

˜U (k) = ˜S(k) ˜G ˜Φ ˜C(θ2) ˜S(k) ˜G−1 ˜Φ ˜C(θ1).

(14a)

(14b)

By solving the eigenvalue problem, the quasi-energy of

the time-evolution operator in Eq. (14b) is derived as

cos(±εk) = cos θ1 cos θ2 cos 2(k + φ) − sin θ1 sin θ2 cosh(2γ),

(15)

and the corresponding eigenvector is

P =Xn
T =Xn

|−nihn| ⊗ ˜P =Xk
|nihn| ⊗ ˜T =Xk

|−kihk| ⊗ ˜P,
|−kihk| ⊗ ˜T ,

(17)

(18)

where ˜P and ˜T act on internal space of the time-evolution
operator. We understand that the parity symmetry oper-
ator P ﬂips the sign of momentum k because the operator
P changes the position n to −n and the TRS operator
T also ﬂips the sign of k since the operator T is an anti-
unitary operator including a complex conjugate K.
Then, we convert Eqs. (6)-(8) for the Hamiltonian into
those for the time-evolution operator in Eq. (14). By
using the relation between the time-evolution operator
and the eﬀective Hamiltonian: U = e−iH , We derive
relations for parity-symmetry, TRS, and PT symmetry
as

PUP −1 = U,
T UT −1 = U −1,
(PT )U (PT )−1 = U −1.

where

cos 2ξk =p1 − (d2/|dk|)2,
d1 = sin θ1 cos θ2 cos 2(k + φ) + cos θ1 sin θ2 cosh(2γ),
d2 = − sin θ2 sinh(±2γ),
d3 = − cos θ2 sin 2(k + φ).

sin 2ξk = d2/|dk|,

(16)

By substituting Eqs. (17) and (18) into the above rela-
tions, we obtain

˜P ˜U (k) ˜P −1 = ˜U (−k),
˜T ˜U (k) ˜T −1 = ˜U −1(−k),
( ˜P ˜T ) ˜U (k)( ˜P ˜T )−1 = ˜U −1(+k),

(19)

(20)

(21)

respectively.

In order to identify symmetries, we need to examine
whether the time-evolution operator of the non-unitary
quantum walk in Eq. (14b) satisﬁes the above relations.

straightforwardly obtain relations for the same elemental
operators by comparing left and right hand sides of Eq.
(19) by substituting Eq. (14b), e.g., ˜P ˜S(k) ˜P −1 = ˜S(−k),
˜P ˜G ˜P −1 = ˜G, and etc. On the other hand, for TRS
and PT symmetry, there appear the inverse operators
of the time-evolution operator in the right hand side of
Eqs. (20) and (21), which invert the time order of el-
emental operators and then prevent us from deriving
the one to one correspondence for the same elemental
operators.
Indeed, according to recent work on sym-
metries which are important to topological phases of
quantum walks, it has become clear that the presence
of the inverse of time-evolution operators in symmetry

5

relations prevents us from straightforwardly identifying
the symmetries. To overcome this diﬃculty, a concept
of symmetry time f rame has been introduced[46]. The
symmetry time frame requires a redeﬁnition of the time-
evolution operator by shifting the origin of time so that
the time-evolution operator exhibits symmetric order of
elemental operators in the time direction. In the case of
˜U (k) in Eq. (14b), the redeﬁned time-evolution operator
˜U ′(k) ﬁtted in the symmetric time frame is written down
as

˜U ′(k) = ˜C(θ1/2) ˜S(k) ˜Φ ˜G ˜C(θ2) ˜G−1 ˜Φ ˜S(k) ˜C(θ1/2),

(22)

2 σ1 ˜U (k)e−i θ1

which we can obtain by the unitary transformation;
˜U ′(k) = ei θ1
2 σ1 . Here, we use the commu-
tative property between operators ˜G, ˜S(k), and ˜Φ as
they are described by exponentials of σ3. By substituting
˜U ′(k) in Eq. (22) into Eqs. (19)-(21), we obtain condi-
tions for elemental operators ˜C(θi), ˜G, ˜S(k), and ˜Φ to
retain each symmetry. For example, in the case of TRS,
we obtain the following two equations from left and right
hand sides of Eq. (20) by substituting Eq. (22):

LHS = [ ˜T ˜C(θ1/2) ˜T −1][ ˜T ˜S(k) ˜T −1][ ˜T ˜Φ ˜T −1][ ˜T ˜G ˜T −1]··· ,
RHS = [ ˜C −1(θ1/2)][ ˜S−1(−k)][ ˜Φ−1][ ˜G]··· .
Comparing two equations, we obtain conditions for the
elemental operators, such as, ˜T ˜C(θ1) ˜T −1 = ˜C −1(θ1),
and so on. We summarize conditions on all elemental
operators for various symmetries in Table I. Using Ta-
ble I, we discuss symmetries of the time-evolution opera-
tor by starting from the unitary case, then including the
gain/loss and phase operators step by step.

In the case γ = φ = 0: In this case, the time-evolution
operator ˜U ′(k) describes the unitary quantum walk and
we consider conditions only on ˜C(θi) and ˜S(k) in Table I.
From the anti-commutation relations of Pauli matrices,
we identify that ˜U ′(k) satisﬁes parity symmetry and TRS
with the following symmetry operators:
˜P = σ1, ˜T = σ1K.

(23)

Therefore, by combing the two symmetry operators in
Eq. (23), the PT symmetry operator is determined as
(24)

˜P ˜T = σ0K,

where σ0 = diag(1, 1), and ˜U ′(k) also possesses PT sym-
metry.
In the case γ 6= 0 and φ = 0: The ﬁnite γ makes ˜U ′(k)
the non-unitary time-evolution operator and we should
consider the additional condition on the gain/loss oper-
ator ˜G as well as those on ˜C(θi) and ˜S(k) in Table I.
Since conditions on ˜G for parity symmetry and TRS by
symmetry operators in Eq.
(23) are not satisﬁed, the
time-evolution operator ˜U ′(k) has neither parity symme-
try nor TRS. However, when we consider PT symmetry,

the condition ( ˜P ˜T ) ˜G( ˜P ˜T )−1 = ˜G with ˜P ˜T in Eq. (24) is
satisﬁed. Therefore, we identify PT symmetry and con-
ﬁrm that the non-unitary time-evolution operator ˜U ′(k)
(with φ = 0) preserves PT symmetry.
In the case γ 6= 0 and φ 6= 0: Now, the condition
on the phase operator in Table I is also maintained to
retain PT symmetry. We easily conﬁrm the condition
( ˜P ˜T ) ˜Φ( ˜P ˜T )−1 = ˜Φ∗ with ˜P ˜T in Eq.
(24). Thereby,
we conclude that, nevertheless individual parity symme-
try and TRS are broken in the non-unitary quantum
walk with the phase operator in the homogeneous sys-
tem, there presents PT symmetry.
We recall that the suﬃcient condition for quasi-energy
being real requires the other condition, namely, the eigen-
vector of the non-unitary time-evolution operator is also
one of the PT symmetry operator. To check this, apply-
ing the unitary transformation ei(θ1/2)σ1 to the eigenvec-
tor of ˜U (k) in Eq. (16), the eigenvector of ˜U ′(k) ﬁtted
in the symmetry time frame is described as |Ψ′
k,±i =
ei(θ1/2)σ1|Ψk,±i. Then, we can straightforwardly conﬁrm
the equation,

˜P ˜T |Ψ′

as long as ξk is real (then εk is also real). Therefore,
we conﬁrm that the entirely real quasi-energy in Eq.
(15) originates to PT symmetry of the non-unitary time-
evolution operator.

2.

extra symmetries

The time-evolution operator of the non-unitary quan-
tum walk in Eq. (22) can posses extra symmetries. Here,
we discuss such symmetries which are intensively stud-
ied for topological phases of the quantum walk[42, 46–
50]. These extra symmetries are chiral symmetry and
particle-hole symmetry (PHS) deﬁned for a Hamiltonian
H as

Deﬁning the symmetry operators as

Γ =Xn
Ξ =Xn

|nihn| ⊗ ˜Γ =Xk
|nihn| ⊗ ˜Ξ =Xk

|kihk| ⊗ ˜Γ,
|−kihk| ⊗ ˜Ξ,

we derive relations to retain chiral symmetry and PHS:

˜Γ ˜U (k) ˜Γ−1 = ˜U −1(+k),
˜Ξ ˜U (k) ˜Ξ−1 = ˜U (−k).

(27)

(28)

Substituting Eq. (22) into Eqs. (27) and (28), we again
obtain conditions on the elemental operators to retain
chiral symmetry and PHS as shown in Table I. Due to
2π periodicity of the quasi-energy, if the time-evolution
operator satisﬁes Eq. (27) and/or (28), the quasi-energy
appears symmetric with respect to ε = 0 and π.

In the case γ = φ = 0: At ﬁrst, we focus on condi-
tions on the coin and shift operators in the case of chiral
symmetry in Table I for this unitary quantum walk. We
ﬁnd that, with the symmetry operator ˜Γ = iσ2, chiral
symmetry is retained. It is known that if TRS and chiral
symmetry are presented, PHS is simultaneously retained
with the symmetry operator ˜Ξ = ˜Γ ˜T . In summary, by
using

˜Γ = iσ2, ˜Ξ = σ3K,

(29)

the unitary time-evolution operator ˜U ′(k) has extra sym-
metries, chiral symmetry and PHS.
In the case γ 6= 0 and φ = 0:

In order to retain
chiral symmetry and PHS for this non-unitary quan-
tum walk, the gain/loss operator ˜G should be unchanged
(X ˜GX −1 = ˜G) when X = ˜Γ or ˜Ξ in Eq. (29) is acted on.
We understand that X = ˜Ξ keeps ˜G as is, while X = ˜Γ
does not. Thereby, only PHS survives after including
gain and loss eﬀect. However, we can introduce a new
symmetry combined with parity and chiral symmetries,

(PΓ) U (PΓ)−1 = U −1,

Γ H Γ−1 = −H,
Ξ H Ξ−1 = −H,

(25)

(26)

that we call parity-chiral symmetry (PCS). Taking ac-
count of Eqs.
(19) and (27), we derive the symmetry
relation for PCS

respectively. The chiral symmetry operator Γ is a unitary
operator, while the PHS operator Ξ is an anti-unitary
one. These two symmetries guarantee that the system
has a pair of eigenstates with opposite sign of eigenval-
ues if the eigenvalue is real. Accordingly, eigenenergy
appears symmetric with respect to zero energy. Follow-
ing the same procedure with before, we convert Eqs. (25)
and (26) to symmetry relations for the time-evolution op-
erator:

Γ U Γ−1 = U −1,
Ξ U Ξ−1 = U.

( ˜P ˜Γ) ˜U (k) ( ˜P ˜Γ)−1 = ˜U −1(−k),

(30)

and then obtain conditions on each elemental operator as
listed in Table I. We note that PCS also guarantees the
symmetric behavior of the quasi-energy with respect to
ε = 0 and π. From Eqs. (23) and (29), the parity-chiral
symmetry operator becomes

˜P ˜Γ = σ3,

(31)

(we ignore an unimportant minus sign). With the above
symmetry operator ˜P ˜Γ, we conﬁrm that ˜U ′(k) possesses
PCS, and the symmetric property of the quasi-energy is
guaranteed by PHS and PCS.

TABLE I. A list of conditions for elemental operators so that the time-evolution operator ˜U ′(k) satisﬁes parity, time-reversal,
and PT , chiral, particle-hole, and parity-chiral symmetries. The ﬁrst column indicates each symmetry and the second column
represents the symmetry operators X = ˜P, ˜T , ˜P ˜T , ˜Γ, ˜Ξ and ˜P ˜Γ, and the third column Xu shows speciﬁc forms of symmetry
operators which are derived from the unitary time-evolution operator with γ = φ = 0. The forth to seventh columns show
conditions for the elemental operators to satisfy each symmetry. This table in this part should be read, i.e., in order to satisfy
parity symmetry the coin operator should satisfy ˜P ˜C(θi) ˜P −1 = ˜C(θi). The yes or no, next to each condition explains the
condition is satisﬁed or not, respectively, with the symmetry operator Xu. Note that ˜C(θi) = eiθiσ1 , ˜S(k) = eikσ3 , ˜G = eγσ3 ,
and ˜Φ = eiφσ3 . We use the following relations; ˜C −1(θi) = ˜C(−θi), ˜S−1(k) = ˜S(−k), ˜S−1(−k) = ˜S(+k), and ˜Φ−1 = ˜Φ∗.

In the case γ 6= 0 and φ 6= 0: Finally, we consider
the non-unitary quantum walk with ﬁnite phases whose
quasi-energy is given in Eq. (15). To retain PHS and
PCS, the phase operator should satisfy ˜Ξ ˜Φ˜Ξ−1 = ˜Φ and
( ˜P ˜Γ) ˜Φ( ˜P ˜Γ)−1 = ˜Φ∗, respectively. However, both con-
ditions are not satisﬁed with the symmetry operators in
Eqs. (29) and (31). Thereby, the ﬁnite γ and φ break
all symmetries which guarantee a pair of eigenstates with
the opposite quasi-energy.

While the above result implies that a pair of quasi-
energy in Eq. (15) does not originate to symmetry, we
can still ﬁnd out contributions of symmetry by introduc-
ing a modiﬁed version of parity symmetry deﬁned be-
low. Because of translation symmetry in the homoge-
neous system, we re-express the time-evolution operator
in Eq. (22) by including the phase operator into the shift
operator as
˜U ′(k) = ˜C(θ1/2) ˜S(k + φ) ˜G ˜C(θ2) ˜G−1 ˜S(k + φ) ˜C(θ1/2).
(32)

Next, we introduce the modiﬁed parity symmetry oper-
ator with phase modulations deﬁned as

e−i2φn|−nihn| ⊗ ˜Pφ =Xk

|−k − 2φihk| ⊗ ˜Pφ.
Pφ =Xn
By combing the modiﬁed parity symmetry operator
Pφ and chiral symmetry operator Γ, the condition on
the shift operator ˜S(k + φ) to retain modiﬁed PCS,
( ˜Pφ ˜Γ) ˜U ′(k)( ˜Pφ ˜Γ)−1 = ˜U ′−1(−k − 2φ), becomes
( ˜Pφ ˜Γ) ˜S(k + φ)( ˜Pφ ˜Γ)−1 = ˜S(k + φ).

which is satisﬁed by the symmetry operator ˜Pφ ˜Γ = σ3.
Note that conditions for ˜C(θi) and ˜G to retain modiﬁed
PCS are the same with those of PCS, since both operators
are k independent. Thereby, we identify that a pair of
quasi-energy in Eq. (15) originates from modiﬁed PCS.

B. Symmetries in inhomogeneous systems

Next, we consider PT symmetry, PHS, and PCS of the
time-evolution operator of the non-unitary quantum walk
in Eq. (3) with position dependent parameters. There-
fore, we need to consider the time-evolution operator in
the position representation. Taking the symmetry op-
erators for internal space in Eqs.
(24), (29), and (31)
into account, those in the position representation are de-
scribed as

PT =Xn
Ξ =Xn
PΓ =Xn

|−n + qihn| ⊗ σ0K,

|nihn| ⊗ σ3K,

|−n + qihn| ⊗ σ3,

(33a)

(33b)

(33c)

where the index q is introduced to determine the ori-
gin of the space reﬂection point (see Fig. 4) because we
treat lattice systems. By using the symmetry operators
in Eqs. (33a)-(33c), each symmetry deﬁned for the time-
evolution operator in the position representation becomes

(PT )U (PT )−1 = U −1,

ΞU Ξ−1 = U,

(PΓ)U (PΓ)−1 = U −1.

(34a)

(34b)

(34c)

Equations (33) and (34) guarantee that if two of the
above three symmetries are conﬁrmed, there also exists
the other symmetry which is derived by combining the
conﬁrmed two symmetries. Even in the position repre-
sentation, we need to use the time-evolution operator ﬁt-
ted into the symmetry time frame written as

U ′ = C(θ1/2) S G2 Φ2 C(θ2) S G1 Φ1 C(θ1/2).

(35)

8

that, while the conditions Eq. (37) guarantee that the
time-evolution operator has PT symmetry, they do not
guarantee that eigenvectors of the time-evolution opera-
tor are those of the PT symmetry operator.
In the same way, we can obtain conditions to preserve
PCS and PHS for the time-evolution operator in inhomo-
geneous systems. We ﬁnd that PCS is maintained under
the following conditions:

θi(n) = θi(−n + q),
g1,L(n) = [g2,L(−n + q + 1)]−1,
g1,R(n) = [g2,R(−n + q − 1)]−1,
φ1,L(n) = −φ2,L(−n + q + 1),
φ1,R(n) = −φ2,R(−n + q − 1).

(38a)

(38b)

(38c)
(38d)
(38e)

Comparing the above conditions, Eq. (38), with those
for PT symmetry in Eq. (37), we understand that, while
Eqs. (38a)-(38c) are the same with Eqs. (37a)-(37c),
the conditions on phases φi,σ(n) to retain PT symme-
try and PCS cannot be simultaneously satisﬁed unless
φi,σ(n) = 0. This gives another conclusion that PHS
is retained only if φi,σ(n) = 0 since PHS can be de-
ﬁned as the combination of PT symmetry and PCS,
Ξ = (PT ) (PΓ). By combining Eqs. (37) and (38), we
also understand that there is no constraint on θi(n) and
gi,σ(n) to retain PHS.

IV. APPLICATIONS

Finally, we apply results to retain various symme-
tries obtained in Sec. III into speciﬁc models of non-
unitary quantum walks. At ﬁrst, we identify sym-
metries of the non-unitary quantum walk realized in
the experiment[43]. For the next example, we demon-
strate that,
for an inhomogeneous non-unitary quan-
tum walk where four distinct spatial region exists, the
time-evolution operator possesses PT symmetry and the
quasi-energy becomes entirely real.

A. Symmetries satisﬁed in the experiment

Here, we directly identify symmetries of the non-
unitary quantum walk realized in the experiment[43]
from the time-evolution operator. The time-evolution
operator in the experiment, Uex, is given by Eq. (3) by
assigning the following parameters:

θ1(n) = θ2(n) = π/4,

g1,L(n) = [g2,L(n)]−1 = e+γ0,
g1,R(n) = [g2,R(n)]−1 = e−γ0,
φ1,L(n) = φ2,L(n) = 0,

(39a)

(39b)

(39c)
(39d)

φ1,R(n) = φ2,R(n) =( −φ0 for mod(n + 3, 4) = 1, 2,

+φ0 for mod(n + 3, 4) = 3, 0.

(39e)

FIG. 4. (Color online) The diﬀerence of the reﬂection points
of the parity symmetry operator. When q = 0, the reﬂection
point is on the site n = 0. When q = ±1, the reﬂection point
is between sites n = 0 and n = ±1.

As shown in Sec. III A, when parameters of the coin,
gain/loss, and phase operators are position independent,
conditions to retain each symmetry are reduced to condi-
tions to the elemental operators as summarized in Table
I. This simpliﬁcation is based on the fact that all of the
operators ˜G, ˜S(k), and ˜Φ are described by exponentials
of σ3, and then they are commutative. However, when
the parameters depend on position, the shift operator S
is not commutative with gain/loss operator Gi and phase
operator Φi. Thus, we need to consider conditions for op-
erators SGiΦi as a whole. For example, the condition to
retain PT symmetry for the time-evolution operator is
(35) into Eq.
derived as follows. By substituting Eq.
(34a), the left and right hand sides become
LHS = [(PT ) C(θ1/2) (PT )−1] [(PT ) SG2Φ2 (PT )−1]··· ,
RHS = [C −1(θ1/2)] [(SG1Φ1)−1]··· ,
respectively. By comparing these two equations, we ob-
tain the conditions to retain PT symmetry for the time-
evolution operator of the non-unitary quantum walk in
inhomogeneous systems as

(PT )C(θi)(PT )−1 = C −1(θi),

(PT )(SGiΦi)(PT )−1 = (SGjΦj)−1,

(36a)

(36b)

where i, j = 1, 2 and i 6= j. From Eq. (36), we obtain
conditions imposed on each position dependent parame-
ter to retain PT symmetry as

θi(n) = θi(−n + q),
g1,L(n) = [g2,L(−n + q + 1)]−1,
g1,R(n) = [g2,R(−n + q − 1)]−1,
φ1,L(n) = φ2,L(−n + q + 1),
φ1,R(n) = φ2,R(−n + q − 1).

(37a)

(37b)

(37c)
(37d)
(37e)

We ﬁnd that, on one hand, the parameter θi(n) of the
coin operator is uncorrelated in time direction, which
means that, θ1(n) and θ2(n) can be determined inde-
pendently. On the other hand, parameters of gain/loss
and phase operators have strict restrictions in time direc-
tion as well as in position space. We should also remind

In both cases, quasi-energy exists being
symmetric with respect to ε = 0.

The quasi-energy of this time-evolution operator becomes

where

fk(γ0, φ0) =

[ cosh(4γ0)(cos2 φ0 − 1)
− 3 cos2 φ0 + 4 + cos k].

Regarding PT symmetry, we can conﬁrm that all param-
eters in Eq. (39) satisfy conditions in Eq. (37) to retain
PT symmetry, especially, by choosing q = −1 for φi,L(n)
which only depends on the position. Therefore, we can
identify PT symmetry of the non-unitary time-evolution
operator Uex with the symmetry operator in Eq. (33a).
From Eq. (40) and Fig. 5, we expect that the time-
evolution operator Uex also has PHS and PCS because
there appear pairs with the opposite quasi-energy ±ε.
However, as shown in Sec. III B, the ﬁnite φi,σ(n) pre-
vents PHS and PCS. This problem is solved by introduc-
ing a modiﬁed PHS operator with a position shift by r
as

Ξr =Xn

|n + rihn| ⊗ σ3K

(41)

By using the modiﬁed PHS operator Ξr, the condition on
the phase parameter to satisfy ΞrU Ξ−1
r = U is derived
as

φi,σ(n) = −φi,σ(n + r).

(42)

Inputting r = 2, we conﬁrm that the phase parameter
in Eq.
(42). Therefore, the time-
evolution operator Uex also preserves modiﬁed PHS.

(39e) satisﬁes Eq.

B. Non-unitary quantum walks with four distinct

regions

Although we can construct various time-evolution op-
erators of non-unitary quantum walks in inhomogeneous
systems with PT symmetry by employing the conditions
in Eq. (37), keeping real number of the quasi-energy re-
quires the additional condition that eigenstates of the
time-evolution operator are those of the PT symmetry
operator. Since it is our empirical fact that the addi-
tional condition is often broken in systems with strongly
position dependent parameters, here we treat a rather
moderate inhomogeneous non-unitary quantum walk as
shown in Fig. 6 (a). This system has four distinct spa-
tial regions with diﬀerent parameters by combinations of
LA/B and L+/− where each region are deﬁned as

LA : − L/2 ≤ n ≤ L/2,
LB : n ≤ −L/2 − 1, n ≥ L/2 + 1,
L+ : n ≥ 0,
L− : n ≤ −1.

Taking account of Eq. (37) with q = 0, we choose param-
eters of the elemental operators as follows for instance:

+π/6

n ∈ LA,
n ∈ LB,
n ∈ LA,
n ∈ LB,

θ1(n) =( +π/4
−π/8
θ2(n) =( −π/3
g1,L(n) = [g2,L(−n + 1)]−1 =( 1.1
g1,R(n) = [g2,R(−n + 1)]−1 =( 1.2
φ1,L(n) = φ2,L(−n + 1) =( π/4
φ1,R(n) = φ2,R(−n + 1) =( −π/3
−π/6

We emphasize that θi(n) is symmetric with respect to the
origin of position space, while gi,σ(n) and φi,σ(n) are not.
We also remark that the ﬁrst (second) gain/loss operator
G1(2) only ampliﬁes (dumps) wave function amplitudes
of both left and right mover components as shown in Fig.
6 (b), in contrast to the experimental setup in Fig. 1 (a).
We numerically calculate eigenvalues of the time-
evolution operator U assigned the above parameters by
imposing periodic boundary conditions to both ends L−1
and −L with L = 128. As shown in Fig. 7 we clearly see
that all eigenvalues stay on a unit circle in a complex
plain, which indicates that the quasienergy is entirely
real. Furthermore, eigenvalues are not symmetric with
respect to ε = 0, π, because the position dependent phase
parameters φi,σ(n) break both PHS and PCS.

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We have explicitly deﬁned the PT symmetry opera-
tor for the time evolution operator of the non-unitary
quantum walk given in Eq. (3), and identiﬁed necessary
and suﬃcient conditions, Eq. (37), on position depen-
dent parameters of the elemental operators to retain PT
symmetry. Taking account of the conditions, we have
succeeded to clarify the presence of PT symmetry of the
non-unitary quantum walk realized in the experiment by
using optical-ﬁbre loops[43] from the time-evolution op-
erator. This has been accomplished for the ﬁrst time by
employing the concept of the symmetry time frame which
had been developed in the recent work on topological
phases of quantum walks[42]. At the same time, we have
also studied extra symmetries embedded in the time evo-
lution operator of the non-unitary quantum walk, such as
chiral symmetry, PHS, PCS, and so on. We have demon-
strated in Sec. IV B that the inhomogeneous non-unitary
quantum walk which has PT symmetry and even pos-
sesses entirely real quasienergy is possible.

We believe that the result obtained in the present
work stimulates further developments on PT symmetry
of non-unitary time-evolution operators which has not
yet been studied enough, compared with non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians. Also, the conditions Eq. (37) would
strongly support the experiment by using the optical-
ﬁbre loops[43] as the versatile platform for studying phe-
nomena originating to PT symmetry. Besides this, al-
though we have focused on the optical-ﬁbre setup in the
present work, our result can be straightforwardly applied
to other setups of the quantum walk. Furthermore, we
can easily generalize our theory to the non-unitary quan-
tum walk only with dissipation, which would be much
easier to realized in various experimental setups. In ad-
dition, since we have shown that the non-unitary quan-
tum walk can retain important symmetries to establish
topological phases, it would be interesting to study topo-
logical phases and corresponding edge states of the non-
unitary quantum walk, which we will report on elsewhere.
An important open problem is to identify a generalized
condition to retain real quasi-energy of the non-unitary
quantum walk. According to progresses on PT symme-
try of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, it is already known
that the argument on PT symmetry can be generalized
as, if a Hamiltonian H satisﬁes a pseudo-Hermiticity con-
dition ηHη−1 = H † with a positive operator η which may
not be related to parity symmetry, eigenenergy could be-
come real[51, 52]. Indeed, we observed possibly relating
phenomena in our non-unitary quantum walk setup be-
cause quasi-energy becomes entirely real even when θ1(n)
is completely random in position space. This suggests a
possibility to retain real quasi-energy of the non-unitary
time-evolution operator without strong constraint on the
position space. We leave this issue as a future work.
