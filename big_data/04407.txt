We propose an engineering of the optical properties of GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells using AlAs
and InAs monolayer insertions. A quantitative study of the eﬀects of the monolayer position and the
well thickness on the interband and intersubband transitions, based on the extended-basis sp3d5s∗
tight-binding model, is presented. The eﬀect of insertion on the interband transitions is compared
with existing experimental data. As for intersubband transitions, we show that in a GaAs/AlGaAs
quantum well including two AlAs and one InAs insertions, a three level {e1, e2, e3} system where
the transition energy e3 − e2 is lower and the transition energy e2 − e1 larger than the longitudinal
optical phonon energy (36 meV) can be engineered together with a e3 − e2 transition energy widely
tunable through the TeraHertz range.

INTRODUCTION

Semiconductor quantum wells (QW) are the building
blocks of a large number of opto-electronic devices. Inter-
band transitions in QWs have been used in devices such
QW lasers, modulators and detectors while intersub-
band (ISB) transitions have allowed engineering of quan-
tum cascade lasers and QW infrared photodetectors1.
Due to unlimited choice in terms of width and mate-
rial combinations, these structures can be used in opto-
electronic applications covering a wide spectral range.
Moreover, diﬀerent techniques to tune the opto-electronic
properties of QWs have been proposed such as strain
engineering2, doping3,4, or monolayer insertion5–7. The
latter have been used successfully for tailoring the in-
terband transitions and their Stark shift in electro-
absorption modulators8 by simply changing the position
of the insertion within the well.

More recently, strong eﬀort has been devoted to ex-
tending the range of ISB applications to the terahertz
(THz) range9. Although asymmetric semiconductor QW
structures can be used as laser sources of controllable
THz radiation, whatever the active region design, intrin-
sic non-radiative recombination processes are generally
faster than the radiative lifetime of excited states, which
hinders the population inversion between subbands10.
QWs based on GaAs and AlAs are particularly inter-
esting for intersubband applications thanks to the close
lattice constants which guarantees small epitaxial stress
and allows the thick epilayers needed in QCL devices. In
existing THz QCLs, the lifetime of the lower laser state
is determined by the tunneling electron extraction time
into the collector/injector and do not display a strong
temperature dependence. Conversely, the lifetime of the
upper laser state strongly increases when increasing the
temperature. This is a major limitation, preventing these

QCLs from lasing at high temperature 11–14. The design
of new active region where the lifetime of both upper and
lower laser states have the same temperature dependency
would represent an important step toward THz laser de-
vice operating at room temperature.

For a quantitative modeling of such structures, dif-
ferent approaches may be considered. First principle
calculations cannot be used, due to the large size of
relevant systems (several hundred atom supercells) and
their limited precision for excited states representation.
Conversely, empirical-parameter models, such as the k.p
or envelope-function theory (EFT)15,16 or atomistic ap-
proaches like the empirical pseudopotential17 and tight-
binding (TB) methods, are suitable for this purpose.
While EFT is still the most widely used technique, its
applicability to the sub-nm scale (like monolayer inser-
tions) is questionable. Conversely, atomistic approaches
have no methodological limitation in handling the case
of ultrathin layers and chemical discontinuities. In par-
ticular, the TB method and its extended basis sp3d5s∗
model have been shown to provide a description of the
band structure with sub-meV precision throughout the
Brillouin zone of the binary semiconductors as well as
their heterostructures18,19.

In this work, we present a quantitative study of the ef-
fects of an inserted AlAs monolayer on the interband and
intersubband transitions in a GaAs/GaAlAs QW. The re-
sults for interband transitions are compared to existing
experimental data. A large tunability of transition ener-
gies and dipole moments between electron subbands are
demonstrated in the THz window as function of the in-
sert position. We also show that a new functionality, the
fast depopulation of intermediate state by LO-phonons
in a 3-level scheme can be engineered. The paper is or-
ganized as follows:
in sec. II, we describe the consid-
ered structure and the simulation model. In sec. III and

sec. IV, we present and discuss the eﬀects of the insert
position on the transition energies and the optical dipole
momentum of the interband and intersubband transitions
respectively, before we conclude in sec. V.

II. SYSTEM OF INTEREST AND METHODS

In the present study, we consider a (001)-oriented
(GaAs)n/(AlGaAs)m superlattice structure where n and
m are the numbers of the molecular monolayers (ML)
of GaAs and GaAlAs respectively. The basic unper-
turbed structure studied in this work consists in a GaAs
well with ∼15 nm width (52 ML), alternating with
Al0.3Ga0.7As barriers grown on a GaAs (001) substrate.
The barrier is thick enough to ensure that the tunnel
coupling between adjacent wells be negligible. The al-
loyed barrier is modeled using virtual crystal approxi-
mation (VCA) where the TB parameters of the virtual
crystal are arithmetic means of the constituent material
parameters weighted to their concentrations. The unper-
turbed system is characterized by the D2d point group
symmetry and interband transitions obey a parity selec-
tion rule with a largely dominant δn = 0 contribution.
Unless perfectly centered, the AlAs monolayer insertion
reduces the symmetry level to C2v and breaks the parity
selection rule. When the well contains an even number
of monolayers, this holds for any position of the insert
since the latter will always be surrounded by GaAs lay-
ers of slightly diﬀerent thicknesses, e.g. at best 26 ML
and 25 ML respectively for a 52 ML QW. Conversely,
for a QW with odd ML number, the insert can be per-
fectly centered and in this particular case the potential
inserted QW retains the D2d point group symmetry. Fi-
nally, it is noteworthy that in addition to breaking the
parity selection rule, C2v symmetry allows for in-plane
optical polarization anisotropy, that is particularly visi-
ble in the narrow spectral range between the e1-hh1 and
e1-lh1 transitions20,21.
The electronic structure of the superlattices is com-
puted using the extended basis sp3d5s∗ TB model based
on Jancu et al parameters18. This parametrization has
shown to allow excellent full-band representation of bulk
semiconductors and a good transferability to quantum
heterostructures18,19. The supercell is built by trans-
lating the standard cubic zinc-blende cell in the z di-
rection. Each cubic cell contains two molecular ML.
So,
for a (GaAs)n/(AlGaAs)m superlattice structure
we have (n + m)/2 cubic cells containing eight atoms
each.
In the spds* TB model, each atom contributes
with twenty orbitals, so the system is represented by a
80(n + m) × 80(n + m) Hamiltonian matrix. For each
atom, the 20 × 20 intra-atomic Hamiltonian matrix is
an average of the intra-atomic Hamiltonians in the up
to four bulk compounds it composes with its four near-
est neighbors. The lattice mismatch between AlAs and
GaAs is neglected. However, in the case of InAs inser-
tions, a relaxation of the structure is performed using

2

Keating valence force ﬁeld (VFF) model.22. Modeling
of a single InAs ML in a GaAs matrix compares satis-
factorily with experiments23,24. We used a GaAs/AlAs
and InAs/GaAs valence band oﬀsets (VBOs) of 0.56 eV
and 0.4 eV respectively. In order to calculate the opti-
cal properties of the superlattices, we have coupled the
TB Hamiltonian to an electromagnetic ﬁeld, following
the approach described in refs.25. This coupling model
produces bulk semiconductor dielectric function in good
agreement with experimental results and accurately ac-
counts for QW optical absorption spectra, in particular
interface-induced optical anisotropy26.

III.

INTERBAND TRANSITIONS

We ﬁrstly focus on the interband transitions energies
and the corresponding dipole matrix elements. Calcu-
lations of electronic band structure of the systems de-
scribed in the previous section are performed with vary-
ing the AlAs monolayer position from the left barrier to
the center of the well. Figure 1 shows the optical transi-
tions energies calculated using our tight binding model,
compared with envelope function approximation (EFA)
and experimental data5,6 obtained from low tempera-
ture photoluminescence, excitation and photo-reﬂectance
spectra. The transition energies were calculated at the
center of the Brillouin zone (Γ-point) and labelled accord-
ing to the dominant bulk-state component of initial and
ﬁnal states: conduction (e), heavy-hole (hh) and light-
hole (lh). As can be seen from the ﬁgure 1, the TB cal-
culation agrees with experiment within experimental un-
certainties. In particular, the predicted reduction of the
hh1-lh1 splitting for an insert at the mid-well is clearly
observed in PLE data of Ref. 5. The EFA results6 are also
given in the ﬁgure for comparison. Despite the still rea-
sonable agreement of these results with experience, one
should keep in mind that there is no theoretical ground
for modeling an AlAs ML insertion by 3 ˚A of bulk AlAs
material, using standard EFT continuity relations. It can
be observed that the blueshift of the e1-hh1 and e1-lh1
transitions is maximal when the ML is localized at mid-
well (∼7.5 nm or 26 MLs). In contrast, the maxima of
the e2-hh2 and e2-lh2 transitions occur when the insert
is located at about the quarter of the well (∼3.75 nm).
A qualitative explanation of these observations can be
obtained from a ﬁrst-order perturbation approach where
the insert act as a delta-like repulsive perturbation on
the original QW states. Indeed, as it can be seen on the
ﬁgure 2(a), the largest amplitudes of the unperturbed e1,
lh1 and hh1 ground-state wave functions are located at
the mid-well, whereas the maxima corresponding to e2
and hh2 are located at the quarter of the QW. When
the insert is localized at mid-well (Fig. 2(b)), the eﬀect
of the perturbation is important for hh1, lh1 and e1 and
nearly zero for hh2, lh2 and e2. Conversely, when the
AlAs ML is located at the quarter of the well (∼3.75 nm,
Fig. 2(c)), all the states (hh1, lh1, e1, e2 and hh2) are

3

ity selection rule (∆n even), with a strongly dominant
∆n = 0 contribution. The results shown in Fig. 3(a)
clearly obey this selection rule. However, the insertion
of the AlAs ML breaks the symmetry and thus several
parity-forbidden transitions appear in the spectrum, such
as e1-hh2,e2-lh1, e1-lh2, e2-hh3 and e3-hh2. Only the last
two transitions actually have enough oscillator strength
to be visible in Fig. 3 (b, c). This symmetry breaking
occurs even for the sample (b) where the insert is placed
at the 26th ML. Indeed, as stated in sec. II, since the
well contains an even number of MLs, replacing the 26th
GaAs ML by an AlAs ML create a slightly non-symmetric
structure. This also can be conﬁrmed by the results in
Fig. 2(b) where the wave functions of ground hole and
electron states are not symmetric in respect to the AlAs
ML. Yet, despite the huge asymmetry of the wavefunc-
tions in the potential-inserted quantum well, the parity-
forbidden ∆n = 1 transitions remain quite weak and the
parity-allowed transitions nearly retain their original os-
cillator strength. This reﬂects the fact that, unlike in the
situation of a biased QW, the conduction and valence
band potentials remain “homomorph”, whatever the po-
sition of the insert is: valence and conduction eigenstates
become strongly asymmetric, but they remain similar to
each other. Since diﬀerent eigenstates within a given
band are necessarily orthogonal, the interband overlaps
still obey an approximate ∆n = 0 selection rule.

In order to validate our modeling, we have compared
our computational results to those provided by photore-
ﬂectance (PR) spectroscopy6, which is a well known tech-
nique commonly used to investigate the optical properties
of QWs over a large energy range. The multi quantum-
well structures were grown by a conventional solid-source
molecular beam epitaxy5. The samples consist of se-
quences of six ∼15 nm thick GaAs wells separated by a
∼8.5 nm thick Al0.3Ga0.7As barrier. A single AlAs mono-
layer has been inserted at diﬀerent positions inside the
well. The optical transitions energies were determined
at low temperature (10 K), from the reﬂectivity mea-
surements. Figure 3(d) shows the diﬀerential reﬂectivity
data obtained in the case of the reference sample (with-
out monolayer insertion) and in the case of the samples
containing one AlAs monolayer inserted inside the well,
respectively at the middle (Fig. 3(e)) and at the quar-
ter (Fig. 3(f)) of the QW. The experimental spectra are
dominated by the easily identiﬁed e1-hh1 excitonic tran-
sition and all the other peaks can be precisely assigned
by comparison with the present modeling.

INTERSUBBAND TRANSITIONS

The intersubband transitions in GaAs/GaAlAs QWs
have attracted much attention during the last decades,
due to their use as active region of quantum cascade
lasers and infrared detectors. Sources of terahertz (THz)
emitters are investigated for their various applications in
imaging and wireless communications. The lasers can op-

strongly aﬀected by the perturbing potential. Yet, the
calculated charge densities (Fig. 2(b, c)) evidence that
the AlAs monolayer act as a strong perturbation that
signiﬁcantly aﬀects the wavefunctions, hence the pertur-
bative framework is unable to account quantitatively for
the results. In this sense, the AlAs ML cannot be consid-
ered as a “probe” of the unperturbed QW eigenstates.

Next, we calculate the dipole matrix elements corre-
sponding to the interband transitions. Figure 3 shows
the squared dipole transition elements (EP in eV) for
three diﬀerent samples: (a) the unperturbed well, (b) the
insert placed at the center of the well and (c) the insert
placed at ∼3.75nm from the barrier. In the framework
of the envelope-function theory15, the optical transitions
for a symmetric QW (like the sample (a)) obey a par-

.

GaAs/Ga0.7Al0.3As QW (see Fig. 4.a). We note that the
e1-e2 transition energy is minimum when the ML is at
the mid-well, then it increases to reach a maximum value
when the ML is at a certain position between the barrier
and the mid-well before it decreases again. In contrast,
the e2-e3 transition energy is maximum when the AlAs
ML is at the mid-well and has a minimum value for a
ML position located between the barrier and the mid-
well. This can be explained by a perturbative analysis
of the wavefunctions of e1, e2 and e3 states of the unper-
turbed QW (cf. Fig. 2.b). Indeed, the AlAs ML insertion
acts like a repulsive potential that shifts up all electron
state energies. However, since at the mid-well both e1
and e3 wave functions are maximal while e2 wave func-
tion is minimal, the ML shifts up the e1 and e3 energies
more than the e2 energy, and thus increases the e2-e3
transition energy and reduces the e1-e2 transition energy
with respect to the unperturbed QW transition energies.
Similarly, when the ML is inserted close to the third of
the QW, it has a higher eﬀect on the e2 state energy
and a negligible eﬀect on the e3 state energy. The later
conﬁguration, i. e. when the ML is at the 14th ML, is
more interesting since the e2-e3 transition energy is lower
than the e1-e2 one. However, the e2-e3 transition energy
is still larger than the LO phonon energy, and so fur-
ther engineering (see below) is needed. Figure 4.b shows
the dependence of the optical matrix element and the
oscillator strength of the e1-e2 and e2-e3 transitions on
the insert position. It is clear that both transitions are
still optically active wherever the ML insertion is placed.
Moreover, the oscillator strengths of both transitions is
not drastically aﬀected by the insertion. These results are
encouraging to perform further engineering of the optical
properties through the insertion of multiple MLs.

In order

to obtain a smaller value for the e2-
transition energy, we consider a 52 ML thick
e3
GaAs/Ga0.7Al0.3As QW with two AlAs ML insertion.
Inspired with the previous results the two ML are placed
at the 14th and the 39th ML, respectively. The transition
energies calculated for this structure are: e1-e2=63 meV
and e2-e3=40 meV, while the corresponding oscillator
strength are 24.70 and 41.64, respectively. The e2-e3
transition energy is closer to the LO phonon energy, but
still larger. Further engineering can be done by inserting

sions between the ﬁrst and second excited states. Our TB
model was demonstrated to give an accurate modeling of
intersubband properties (dipole moment and energy) in
strained quantum wells27,28. After corroborating our re-
sults for AlAs and InAs MLs insertion by comparison to
experimental results of interband transitions in the pre-
vious section and in Ref. 7, respectively, we investigate
here the possibility of engineering a three level system
e1, e2, e3 where the e2-e3 transition energy is lower and
the e1-e2 transition energy larger than the LO phonon
energy (36 meV). In a ﬁrst step, we consider the eﬀects
of one AlAs ML insertion on the intersubband transition
energies and optical matrix element of a 52 ML thick

thermore, the large value of the e1-e2 transition energy
allows for further tuning of the structure by changing
the QW thickness, the barrier composition or the MLs
position.

Finally, we investigate the possibility of tuning the e1-
e2 transition energy by modifying the well thickness and
the ML positions. Table I summarize the results for a
selection of diﬀerent structure conﬁgurations. We show
here that the e2-e3 transition energy can be tuned to
cover all the energies below the LO phonon energy and its
oscillator strength stay in the same order of magnitude as
in the unperturbed QW while the e1-e2 transition energy
is kept far above 36meV. These results indicate that the
insert-based engineering technique is promising for the
realization of THz laser at room temperature.

V. CONCLUSION

an extra InAs ML near the QW center. Indeed, the InAs
ML acts like an attractive potential and so reduces the e1
and e3 energies while leaving e2 unchanged. Hence the
InAs ML insertion further reduces the e2-e3 transition
energy and increases the e1-e2 transition energy.

Next, we consider a 52 ML thick GaAs/Ga0.7Al0.3As
QW with two AlAs and one InAs MLs inserted at the
14th, the 39th and the 26th MLs respectively. The cal-
culated transition energies are: e1-e2=125 meV and e2-
e3=25 meV, while the corresponding oscillator strength
are 17.68 and 32.99, respectively. This structure is very
promising to achieve THz generation at room tempera-
ture since the e2-e3 transition energy is lower and the
e1-e2 transition energy is higher than the LO phonon en-
ergy, while the oscillator strength of the e2-e3 transition
is only 34% smaller than the oscillator strength of the
corresponding transition in the unperturbed QW. Fur-

We have studied the eﬀects of AlAs monolayer in-
sertion inside a GaAs/GaAlAs quantum well and how
the variation of the monolayer position and the well
width aﬀect the interband and intersubband transition
properties by mean of the sp3d5s∗ tight-binding model.
Firstly, we validated the theoretical results of the inter-
band transitions by comparing to the diﬀerential reﬂec-
tivity measurement. Then we investigated the intersub-
band transition properties and the possibility of a three
electron states system where the upper transition energy
is smaller and the lower transition energy larger than
the LO phonon energy. We demonstrated that this kind
of system can be obtained by three ML insertions, two
AlAs and one InAs MLs. We also show that the up-
per transition energy can be widely tuned below the LO
phonon energy while the lower transition is always far
above 36 meV.
