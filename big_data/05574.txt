Theoretical interpretation of a spin-two diphoton excess

Ver´onica Sanz1

(Dated: March 18, 2016)

A spin-two resonance would have couplings to the SM, suppressed via higher-dimensional opera-
tors. Therefore, a sizeable cross-section would indicate that the scale of additional new phenomena
cannot be too far above the 750 GeV mark. Below I present some theoretical arguments to place
the resonance in a wider framework: a manifestation of new extra-dimensions, or a glueball of a new
strong sector. In each case, I identify some conditions the UV theory must satisfy to accommodate
other experimental bounds. Based on those, I draw correlations with associated phenomena we
expect to ﬁnd in future searches.

INTRODUCTION

As I write this note, ATLAS and CMS collaborations
are presenting their results on the diphoton excess at
Moriond, an update from the December results [1]. Both
collaborations re-analyzed their data in terms of two hy-
pothesis, spin-zero and -two new resonances. ATLAS ob-
tains a local signiﬁcance of about 3.5σ in both cases, and
explores the compatibility of the data with the Run1.
CMS combines Run1 and Run2, ﬁnding a local signiﬁ-
cance of about 3.4σ in both cases. Finally, both experi-
ments quote a global signiﬁcance in the range of 1 to 2σ,
although these numbers neglect the important fact that
both collaborations see the excess in the same region.
Obviously, we should be cautious and wait for more data
to increase (or decrease) the global signiﬁcance of this
excess, most likely during the late summer conferences.
In the meantime we are going to entertain a few ideas
as to the origin of this excess. Any hint for new physics
is exciting news for us, but a spin-two resonance would
be particularly surprising, as it is not the type of new
physics most people would consider at ﬁrst. To help in
understanding this result from a theoretical perspective,
I am going to place this resonance into a wider perspec-
tive, and provide some guidance on other phenomena we
would then expect to observe.

stems from momentum conservation in the decay. Ass-
suming then Lorentz invariance is preserved by X, inter-
actions cannot come from a renormalizable term in the
Lagrangian. Indeed, the lowest order one can write an
X-SM -SM interaction term is via dimension-ﬁve oper-
ators. With the further assumption that the resonance
interactions preserve CP, one can for example write terms
involving photons and gluons such as

Lint ⊃ −

One could also consider a CP odd spin-two case, but
for simplicity I will continue the discussion with the CP
even option. Note that there would be strong constraints
from couplings of the resonance to light fermions in the
CP-odd case [5]. At any rate, the conclusion that this
resonance interacts via higher-dimensional operators is
valid in both the CP-odd and -even cases.

The upshot of this discussion is that X must inter-
act via non-renormalizable operators, characterized by a
scale of new phenomena Λ. And, although X’s interac-
tions are power suppressed, the signal rate in diphotons is
relatively strong. This leads to the interesting conclusion
that Λ cannot be too far from the TeV scale. Indeed, this
can be understood by looking at the gluon fusion rate to
diphoton at LHC13 [6],

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

Let us

start by setting

a model-independent
parametrization of a spin-two resonance, which I de-
note by Xµν . The propagation of X is described by the
Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian [3]. It describes a massive spin-
two ﬁeld via a rank-two symmetric and traceless tensor,
i.e.Xµν = Xνµ and X µ
µ = 0, which satisﬁes a positive-
energy condition ∂µX µν = 0. The form of the kinetic
term is not particularly revealing, and can be found else-
where, e.g.

[4].

σ(pp → X → γγ) = 8.6pb (cgcγ)2(cid:18) 3TeV

Λ (cid:19)4 (cid:18) GeV

ΓX (cid:19) ,

(2)

where ΓX is the width of the resonance.

So far this discussion has been kept in a model-
independent fashion, but we expect new phenomena not
far from the mass of X. To understand the origin of
the interactions, and draw new predictions, we need to
plunge into possible UV completions of the resonance.

A KALUZA-KLEIN GRAVITON?

We also know that the resonance interacts. The in-
teraction is likely to conserve Lorentz invariance, as one
can see a bump in the diphoton invariant mass, which

An obvious candidate for a massive spin-two resonance
near the TeV scale is a Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton. This

is the interpretation used by the experimental collabora-
tions.

If this were to be correct, it would imply the discovery
of new dimensions of space. Indeed, a massive KK gravi-
ton is the smoking gun of extra-dimensions, or isn’t it? In
fact, it has been shown that Lorentz and CP invariance
ensures that any spin-two resonance exhibits the same
coupling to two SM particles as a KK-graviton [5].

This result, which ﬁts nicely with the notion of holog-
raphy, means that a future discovery of particle X is not
necessarily a signature of extra-dimensions nor the door
to the realm of low-energy quantum gravity.

In my opinion, there are two facts which could suggest
that X is not a signature of extra-dimensions, or that
these extra-dimensions are not as plain vanilla as we have
viewed them so far.

The ﬁrst concern regards the eﬀects of quantum grav-
ity, as they are regulated by the same scale Λ which de-
termines the couplings of the KK-graviton to SM par-
ticles. With cg,γ . O(1), Λ is about 3-5 TeV and one
expects black holes around the same scale, likely quan-
tum black holes [7]. Current limits from Run1 LHC8
on these states [8] are right in this region of multi-TeV,
which is both a promising prospect for Run2 studies, and
a possible way to falsify the KK-graviton hypothesis.

The other issue with the KK-graviton interpretation
is the relation between the mass of a spin-two resonance
and KK-vectors in extra-dimensions V . It is well known
that in AdS warped extra-dimensions, the context used
by CMS to interpret X, there is a gap between the spin-
one and -two KK excitations, mX = 1.5 mV . One would
then expect a spin-one resonances below the mass of X
at about 500 GeVs, which somehow evaded detection.

Hiding such a light vector resonance is a non-trivial
task, as the KK excitations of SM gauge bosons induce
anomalous couplings [9] and can be searched for directly
in the Z ′ and W ′ type of searches []. In the following I am
going to assume that, wherever these vector resonances
are, they are above the mass of X.

To wit, ﬂipping the gap between X and V is quite
challenging. Let us start by trying to remove the vector
resonances, localizing the gauge ﬁelds within the extra-
dimension. Universality of gauge couplings indicates that
the fermions are then either localized on the same posi-
tion or have ﬂat proﬁles. In either case, exchange of the
X particle would lead to sizeable four-fermion interac-
tions [10–12].

Instead of localizing bulk gauge ﬁelds, one could ex-
plore the gap between the vector and tensor KK modes
in non-trivial geometries for the extra-dimensions. For
example, let us consider factorizable metrics of the form

ds2 = w(z)2 (ηµν dxµdxν −Xi,j

dzidzj) .

(3)

Following the techniques in [13], one can obtain a sum
rule involving the masses of KK towers as a function of

the spin [14], which have the typical form

1
M 2
s

≈ Z dzZ z

dy(cid:18) w(z)

w(y)(cid:19)2s−1

.

(4)

As the warping w is positive and monotonically decreas-
ing, one typically reaches the conclusion that even for
non-AdS, yet factorizable, metrics

mV < mX .

(5)

Obviously, the extra-dimensional bag of tricks is richer
than brane localization or warping. For example, one
can try to revert this splitting using localized kinetic or
mass terms [15–18]. Finding such conﬁgurations would
be very interesting.

A GLUEBALL OF NEW STRONG

INTERACTIONS

In the previous section we have seen that the inter-
pretation of X as a signature of extra-dimensions would
need some model-building eﬀorts to be consistent with
the absence of excesses in searches for black holes and
spin-one resonances. Whereas one could argue that the
modelling of quantum black holes suﬀers from our lack of
understanding of a full theory of quantum gravity, hiding
a Z ′ or W ′ at 500 GeV seems rather more daunting.

Focusing then on the issue of the splitting between the
vector and tensor resonances, let us discuss it in the con-
text of a strongly coupled theory. Assume there is a new
strongly coupled sector at the TeV scale, and X is the
ﬁrst signature of this new sector we have discovered, a
spin-two glueball akin to f2 resonance in QCD. Should we
expect a diﬀerent ordering of spin-one and spin-two res-
onances in this theory? At this point, some readers may
jump to say: ”Obviously, the answer is no. Strongly in-
teracting sectors must have a gravitational dual”. There-
fore, the statement that simple gravitational set-ups ex-
hibit vector resonances lighter than tensors surely means
the 4D dual must follow the same trend.

That is indeed the case in most known theories, includ-
ing QCD. In QCD, the lightest spin-two resonance f2 is
heavier than the ρ meson, the lightest spin-one resonance.
One can qualitatively understand this fact using the tech-
niques developed by Jaﬀe, Johnson and Ryzak [19]. In
their work, they identiﬁed the lowest-lying states of a
strongly coupled sector using colourless, local operators
and classifying them by their canonical dimension.

This conjecture, although simplistic and full of caveats,
does connect with ideas of constituent models, where
operators of higher dimension require more excitations.
Nevertheless, note that their arguments, outlined below,
do not account for the eﬀect in the spectrum of other
interactions besides the strong sector, and for the possi-
bility of overlapping states.

Using this dimensional analysis, one can identify the
quantum numbers of the lightest mesons in the theory,
namely spin and CP, or J CP , by decomposing each oper-
ator into irreducible representations of angular momen-
tum, parity and charge. Further information can be ob-
tained by using a mean ﬁeld mode analysis. Generically,
one gets

• In theories involving massless quarks as con-
stituents, the simplest (lowest-dimension) interpo-
lating ﬁelds are dimension-three terms of the form
¯qΓq, where Γ is any Dirac matrix leading to a colour
singlet combination. These operators lead to states
with quantum numbers

J P C = 0−+ and 1−−

(6)

• On the other hand, the gauge interactions them-

selves can produce mesons, or glueballs.
case, the lowest-dimension interpolating operator
is dimension-four, T r Gµν Gαβ, leading to states of
quantum numbers

J P C = 0++ and 2++ .

(7)

Let us leave the scalar mesons aside for a moment. In
QCD-like theories (theories with chiral symmetries), one
would then expect the vector resonances to be lighter
than the tensors, as their interpolating operators are
of lower dimension (dimension-three vs dimension-four).
This is indeed the case in QCD, and lattice simulations
of QCD-like theories do seem to fulﬁll this expectation.
Coming back to the scalar mesons, these may not ap-
pear in the spectrum as narrow resonances and hence
evade detection. Such a mechanism has been proposed
for the case of the σ meson in QCD.

Summing up this discussion, the identiﬁcation of the
X resonance with a spin-two glueball and the absence of
a lighter spin-one meson seem to indicate a speciﬁc type
of strongly coupled sector, namely

X is the lowest-lying resonance of a conﬁning gauge

theory, with no constituent massless fermions.

Based on the statement above, one should look for new
scalar resonances (possibly broader) and a nearby heavier
spin-two excitation [19], which may likely have decays via
the lighter X.

THE CONNECTION WITH THE HIGGS

If X is a bound state of a new strong force, we are faced
with the question: ”Who ordered this sector to conﬁne at
around the electroweak scale?” In other words, can the

3

conﬁnement dynamics Λ ∼ mX be related to electroweak
symmetry breaking and hence the Higgs?

Were the Higgs related to the dynamics at Λ, one would
then suspect the Higgs to be a pseudo-Goldstone boson.
Therefore, this new sector should exhibit a global sym-
metry broken by the new strong sector, leading to the
Higgs boson at lower energies.

At ﬁrst sight, this does not look like a promising spec-
ulation. As we mentioned before, our candidate the-
ory should not have light constituent fermions, otherwise
spin-one bound states would dominate the phenomenol-
ogy.

Moreover, accommodating a pattern of breaking lead-
ing to at least four Goldstone bosons and some amount
of custodial symmetry seems like a tall order for a theory
without chiral symmetries in the usual (QCD-like) sense.
Despite all these diﬃculties, it seems that one can de-
vise theories with massive fermions and global symme-
tries which, after conﬁnement at Λc, produce a set of
Goldstones and no light fermion bound states. Examples
of such models are under investigation [20].

Finally, it would be interesting to investigate this pat-
tern of breaking in the context of the richer structure
of supersymmetric theories, and of non-supersymmetric
holographic duals of the pure glue theory.

SUMMARY

In this note, I have discussed the properties of a pos-
sible new spin-two resonance X and how these indicate
quite speciﬁc types of UV completions.

For example, were X to be a manifestation of new
dimensions of space, it could indicate a non-trivial local-
ization of SM particles in the extra-dimension.
In the
interpretation of X as a glueball of new strong dynam-
ics, the UV theory would seem to be a (mostly) pure-glue
conﬁning theory.

Additionally, it would be terribly unnatural for a res-
onance to show up at the TeV scale, and have no links
to electroweak symmetry breaking. In the text, I have
argued that this connection may not be straightforward,
and may well require new thinking in terms of extra-
dimensional set-ups or strongly coupled theories. In par-
ticular, achieving a spectrum of a Composite Higgs with
a nearby X and no vector resonances, may need some
creative thinking on our side as model-builders.

Needless to say, if the existence of a spin-two X were
conﬁrmed, it would signal the urgent need for new non-
perturbative techniques and the lattice exploration of
non-QCD-like theories. Yet, we would certainly have to
wait until more data is collected to proclaim a new era
for particle physics, and even more data would be nec-
essary to proclaim the discovery of new dimensions of
space-time, or of a new force with its own peculiar dy-
namics.
