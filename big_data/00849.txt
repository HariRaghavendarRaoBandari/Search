Abstract. The classical Vaidya metric is transformed to the special diagonal
coordinates in the case of the linear mass function allowing rather easy treatment.
Using these coordinates, we elaborate the maximum analytic extension of the Vaidya
metric with a linear growth of the black hole mass and construct the corresponding
Carter-Penrose diagrams for diﬀerent speciﬁc cases. The derived global geometry
seemingly is valid also for a more general behavior of the black hole mass in the
Vaidya metric.

1. Introduction

The unique nonstationary solution of the Einstein equations, derived by Prahalad
Chunnilal Vaidya [1, 2, 3], has a very simple form

ds2 =(cid:20)1 −

2Gm(z)

c2r

(cid:21) dz2 + 2dzdr − r2dΩ2,

(1)

where dΩ2 = dθ2 + sin2 θdϕ2 is a line element on the 2-dimensional unit sphere. The
Vaidya metric describes the photon sphere or black hole with a varying mass m(z) due
to the radial inﬂux at z = −v (or outﬂux at z = u) of null particles [4]. Here u is
the advanced time null coordinate and, correspondingly, v is the retarded time null
coordinate. This solution is usually expressed either in the (v, r)– or (u, r)–coordinates.
Later, the Vaidya problem was explored also in the double-null (v, u)-coordinates [5].

In particular,

The Vaidya metric is popular for very diﬀerent astrophysical and theoretical
applications.
it is used for description of evaporating black holes
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The other popular application of Vaidya solution is for the
physically reasonable modeling of the relativistic astrophysical objects and cosmological
scenarios with radially directed outgoing or ingoing radiation [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].
This metric is also relevant to the problems of the gravitational collapse, internal black
hole structure and formation of naked singularities [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,
30, 31, 32, 33, 34].

On maximal analytical extension of the Vaidya metric

The original Vaidya metric is geodesically incomplete. For better understanding
the physical meaning of the Vaydya solution it is important to construct its analytic
extension. This extension was done by W. Israel [35] in a rather general form for the
global geometry of eternal spacetime with the inﬁnite stairs of the Vaidya black-holes
and white-holes. Some other approaches for the construction of analytic extension for
the Vaidya metric use the combinations of physically reasonable particular subregions
[8, 36] and/or the speciﬁc black hole mass functions [20, 37, 38].

The fruitfull methods for analytic investigations of the Vaidya metric are the using
of the double-null coordinates [5] and the linear mass function m(z) [6]. In this paper
we have found the transformation of Vaidya metric (1) to the new diagonal coordinates,
which permit the simple analytical solution for all metric functions in the special case of
linear growth of the black hole mass m(z). Our crucial ansatz for ﬁnding the maximal
analytic extension of the Vaidya metric is in using of the linear black hole mass function,
m(z) = −αz + m0, dm/dz = −α = const, where parameter α > 0 is the mass accretion
or emission rate. By using this ansatz, we can to solve our problem analytically. The
Vaidya metric with a linear mass function was extensively investigated earlier by many
authors in diﬀerent aspects [6, 7, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43].

The use of speciﬁc new coordinates allowed us to reveal the global structure of
spacetime for Vaidya problem with the linear growth of the black hole mass m(z). Exact
solutions for radial photon geodesics provided the main tool for this study. As a result,
the global geometry (with physical restriction m > 0) global geometry was constructed
and the corresponding conformal Carter-Penrose diagram was drown. Note that some
speciﬁc properties of the Vaidya metric in the diagonal coordinates were explored in [4]
without derivation of the corresponding metric functions.

In the Section 2 we explain in details the method of transformation between the
used coordinates. Section 3 is devoted to the detailed construction of the corresponding
Carter-Penrose diagrams. Everywhere, except for the Figures, we put G = c = 1.

2. Transformation to new coordinates

For the detailed investigation of the Vaidya metric with the linear growth of the black
hole mass m(z) it would be useful transform the Vaidya metric (1) to the orthogonal
frame with some new coordinates, respectively, η and y:

(2)

ds2 = f0(η, y)dη2 −

dη2

f1(η, y) − r2(cid:0)dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2(cid:1) ,

with two principal metric functions f0(η, y) and f1(η, y). Note, that the exact
transformation to diagonal coordinates in the general case of the Vaidya metric is still
unknown [4].

Let us ﬁnd the transformation between coordinates (v, r) and (η, y), i. e., from
metric (1) to (2). The ﬁrst new variable η will be deﬁned later, and for the second
new variable we choose y = 1 − 2Gm(z)/r. By diﬀerentiation with respect to r in the

Putting the relations in the two-dimensional part of the metric (1), we derive the system
of three equations for functions f0, f1 and z(η, y):

(1 − y)(y2 − y + 4α)

Inserting here the expression for f1 from (19), we obtain the diﬀerential equation for
the function z(η, y):

.

(9)

Now, multiplying the both parts of this equation by dm/dz = −α, we come to the
equation, which is possible to integrate directly:

It is very helpful that the solution of equation (10) is factorized, m = C(η)Φ(y), with

(1 − y)(y2 − y + 4α)(cid:21) > 0.

As a further step, by diﬀerentiating the equation (3) with radius r, ﬁnd the expression
for derivative

Here the roots of a square trinomial in the nominator y2 − y + 2α equals

(1 + √1 − 8α).

At the same time, the roots a square trinomial y2 − y + 4α in the integrand in Eq. (11)
are

(1 − √1 − 16α),

y4 =

(1 + √1 − 16α).

(14)

If all these roots are real, they are the special points requiring further investigation.
Note, that 0 < y1 < y3 ≤ 1/2 ≤ y4 < y2 < 1.

By redeﬁnition of time variable η it is always possible to make C,η = const.
Then, for the continuous transition to the Schwarzschild limit α → 0 it should be
C(η) = αη + C0 , with C0 = const.

Thus, we get the requested solution in quadratures for the Vaidya metric (2) in the
coordinate frame (η, y) with a linear black hole mass function m(z) = −αz + m0. Note,
that we found the explicit dependence of all metric functions in (2) on coordinates η
and y, not a parametric ones. The integral in (11) depends on the relation α R 1/16.
There are three essentially distinguished cases: (1) the powerful accretion at α > 1/16,
(3) transient case at α = 1/16 and (3) weak accretion at α < 1/16. We consider below
these cases separately in details by using the ﬁnal formulas:

3. Construction of the global geometries

Our aim is to construct for these 3 cases the corresponding conformal Carter-Penrose
diagrams for the corresponding global geometries.

We deﬁne the invariant

Y = γiky,iy,k = −f1 =

1
4m2 (1 − y)3(y2 − y + 4α).

(19)

We will call the spacetime regions with Y < 0 the “R∗-regions”, and the spacetime
regions with Y > 0 the “T ∗-regions”, respectively. In the R∗- η — is the time coordinate
and y — is a space coordinate, within the T ∗-regions, on the contrary, η — is a space
coordinate, y — is a time coordinate.

The physical condition m > 0 provides the restrictions y < 1 and C(η) > 0. We

remind also that Φ > 0 by deﬁnition.

It is interesting to note that the described metric is reduced to the simple form by

conformal transformation

ds2 =

C 2
α2

Φ2

From such a representation it is easily to ﬁnd for the radial null geodesics:

(1 − y)(cid:8)(y2 − 2y + 4α)(cid:2)(d log Φ)2) − (d log C)2(cid:3)(cid:9) − r2dΩ2.(20)

C = A Φ±1, A = const.

(21)

In the case of the accretion the upper sign (+) corresponds to the outgoing null rays,
the lower one (−) – to the ingoing null rays. And vise verse for the emission Vaidya
metric.

Taking into account the diagonal form (20), we draw the Carter-Penrose diagrams

in the coordinates log C and log Φ(y) under the following arctan-type transformation

t = arctan [log C + log Φ(y)] − arctan [log C − log Φ(y)]
x = arctan [log C + log Φ(y)] + arctan [log C − log Φ(y)] ,

(22)

with the corresponding shifts and axes exchanges (as needed).

3.1. Powerful accretion at α > 1/16

We start from the simplest case of the powerful accretion when the accretion rate
α > 1/16. Then, Y > 0, and, therefore, everywhere in the T ∗-region.
In this case
the integration in Eq. (11) gives us

α > 1/8.

The behavior of the function Φ is qualitatively the same in the whole range of
α > 1/16. It is shown in Fig. 1. However, the dependence of the radius on y, i.e. the
function r(y), is diﬀerent in the intervals 1/16 < 1/8 < α, α = 1/8 and 1/16 < α < 1/8.
According to the Eqs. (12) and (13), if α > 1/8, the radius is monotonically increasing
function of y (from r = 0 at y = ∞, to r = ∞ at y = 1). We will name this case by
the super-power accretion. Then, if α = 1/8, there appears the point of inﬂection
at y1 = y2 = 1/2. Finally,
if 1/16 < α < 1/8, one has the local maximum at

y = y1 = (1 − √1 − 8α)/2 and the local minimum at y = y2 = (1 + √1 − 8α)/2. We

will call this case the “just-powerfull” accretion. The corresponding curves are shown
in Figs. 1, 2. Consequently, the curves of constant radii, r = const, will be diﬀerent
on the Carter-Penrose conformal diagrams, shown in Figs. 3, 4, 5. Note also that the
curves y = y1, y = y2 (and, of course, y = y1 = y2 = 1/2) are spacelike.

It is well known that the arbitrary two-dimensional spacetime is conformally
ﬂat. The Carter-Penrose conformal diagram for the complete two-dimensional ﬂat
(Minkowski) spacetime is the square with four null inﬁnities as the boundaries. The
four-dimensional ﬂat (Minkowskian) spacetime written in the spherical coordinates,
can be represented, for ﬁxed angles, by the triangle with two null inﬁnities and the
timelike (vertical) line r = 0. When a spherically symmetric spacetime is curved, in
its diﬀerent parts the corresponding conformal factors can be diﬀerent. Beside the
“natural” boundaries such as r = 0 and inﬁnities, there may exist also the various types
of horizons (null, timelike or spacelike ones) manifesting the margins of diagram for
the spherically symmetric spacetime will consists of some set of triangles and squares
separated by common boundaries.

In the case of the Vaidya metric we impose the additional physical constraint: the
total mass should be non-negative, m ≥ 0. Because of this the physical spacetime may
appear to be geodesically incomplete.

Let us start to construct the boundaries of the Carter-Penrose conformal diagram

in the case of powerfull accretion, α > 1/16. We have

Φ =

2(cid:19)(cid:21). (27)
First of all, since, by deﬁnition, Φ(y) ≤ 0, our physical constraint m ≥ 0 leads to the
inequalities C ≥ 0, y ≤ 1.
It follows from r ≥ 0, that −∞ < y < 1. Thus, the
boundaries are y = −∞ and y = 1. It is easily seen, that for the powerful accretion,
α > 1/16, everywhere Y ≥ 0, i.e., inside the boundaries we have the so called T ∗-region,

Figure 3. Carter-Penrose diagram for the global geometry of the Vaidya metric in
the case of a “super-powerful” linear accretion with α > 1/8. The boundaries are
the horizontal space-line wavy like y = −∞ (in black) corresponding to the curvature
singularity at zero radius, r = 0, and two null lines y = 1 (in blue), one of them being
the past null inﬁnity with r = ∞ (it goes in the direction of the advanced time =
constant retarded time) while the other corresponds to the marginal initial accretion
ray with zero mass, m = 0 (it goes in the direction of the retarded time = constant
advanced time). It is assumed that the time coordinate runs from down to up, and the
spatial coordinate — from left to right. Everywhere inside is the T ∗-region, i. e., the
temporal coordinate is (−y) running from y = −∞ at the top of the Figure to y = 1
at the boundaries (the spacelike surfaces y = const are shown by red dashed curves),
and the spatial coordinate is η (the corresponding timelike surfaces C(η) = const are
shown by blue dashed curves). The dotted green curves represent the levels of constant
radii, r = const, they start from the null line y = 1 (where m = 0) and end at the
right-up corner of the diagram at y = −∞. On the way, they cross the spacelike
line y = 0 that serves as the apparent horizon and separates the spacetime region
where surfaces r = const are timelike (y > 0) from that ones where they are spacelike
(y < 0). Evidently, the spacetime on the diagram is not geodesically complete because
we imposed the physically reasonable condition of the non-negativity of the running
black hole mass, m ≥ 0 (remember, that y = 1 − 2Gm/r).

where the curves y = const are spacelike (actually, it is (−y) that plays the role of time,
which is supposed to run from down to up), and the curves η = const or C(η) = const
are timelike. Then, we see that the boundary y = −∞ (r = 0) is spacelike and singular
(because the invariant Y → +∞ at y → 1). On the ﬁrst sight, the boundaries at
y = 1 are null. However, because of C(η) and Φ(y) in the denominator of Y , one needs
more careful investigation. To do this, we will make use of two congruences of null
geodesics, ingoing and outgoing ones. Consider, ﬁrst, the ingoing rays (the real rays of
the accretion) for which m = C(η)Φ(y) = const, as it should be. They start from y = 1,

On maximal analytical extension of the Vaidya metric

where

(28)

(29)

and ﬁnally encounter the spacelike singularity at r = 0. We see that, indeed, the
boundary is the past null inﬁnity (y = 1, r = ∞). The value of m along this boundary
goes from m = 0 to m = ∞, while Φ(y) = 0 and C(η) = ∞.

The nature of the second boundary y = 1 is a little bit more subtle. Consider the
other congruence of null geodesics, for which C(η) = const · Φ(y). They start from
y = 1, where for y → 1

m ∝ (1 − y),
r = const,

Y ∝ (1 − y).

(30)

(31)

(32)

Therefore, this boundary y = 1 is null, and along it Φ(y) = 0, C(η) = 0, m = 0, and r
is running from r = 0 to r = ∞. Therefore, it is no more the inﬁnity, but serves as the
margin null ray that starts the accretion. Evidently, such a spacetime is not geodesically
complete. And, now vide: (κoιτ α ≡look) at Figs. 3, 4, 5.

m,r = 0, and the second, where y = 1, m = 0, and running radii 0 < r < ∞. The past
null inﬁnity, where y = 1, r = ∞ remains the same. But there appears the future null
inﬁnity, where y = 1/2 with both mass and radius are inﬁnite, m,r = ∞.

The triangle is constructed by the spacelike (horizontal) singular line y = −∞ (as

other is the margin null ray with m = 0 and r = 0 that starts the accretion. There is a
subtle when dealing with the double horizon. The matter is that Φ(1/2 − 0) = 0, and
Φ(1/2−0) = ∞. This problem can be resolved by considering (again) the accretion rays
with CΦ = m = const. We see that C(η) = ∞ at y(1/2− 0), and this is just the end of
the spatial (η!) coordinate range in the triangle. At y(1/2 + 0) we have C(η) = 0, and
this is just the beginning of new spatial (η!) coordinate range in the square. For the
marginal ray with m = 0 along y = 1/2 both C and Φ are zero. The divergence of the
invariant Y should not confuse us since the point y = 1/2 is the coordinate singularity
(the metric determinant is zero there). Evidently, such a spacetime is not geodesically
complete. And now, look at Fig. 7 for the corresponding Carter-Penrose conformal
diagram for the transient case between “powerful” and “weak” accretion, α = 1/16.

3.3. Weak accretion at α < 1/16

In this case the double horizon is splitted in two at y = y3 = (1 − √1 − 16α)/2 and
y = y4 = (1 + √1 − 16α)/2. The very appearance of these “new horizons” is due to the

fact that we consider here the unbounded accretion which inﬁnitely growing the black
hole mass. The function Φ(y) takes now the form

Φ =p1 − y |y − y3|y3/[2(y4−y3)] |y − y4|−y4/[2(y4−y3)],

Figure 9. Carter-Penrose diagram for Vaidya metric in the case of “weak” accretion,
Gα < 1/16. The global geometry is now the most complex. The double horizon

is splitted into two, the event horizon at y = y3 = (1 − √1 − 16Gα)/2 and the
cosmological horizon at y = y4 = (1 + √1 − 16Gα)/2 (note that y1 < y3 < y4 < y2).
In between,
One has the T ∗-regions for −∞ < y < y3 and for y4 < y < 1.
y3 < y < y4, there lies the R∗-region where η is the time coordinate, where y is the
spatial coordinate. The ﬁrst of the T ∗-regions is bounded by the spacelike curvature
singularity y = −∞, r = 0, the marginal null ray where y = y3, and both mass and
radius are zero, m, r = 0, and by the event horizon y = y3. The R∗-region is bounded
by two horizons, y = y3 and y = y4, by the marginal null ray y = y3, m = 0, r = 0,
and by the future null inﬁnity, where y = y4, m = ∞, r = ∞. The second T ∗-region
is bounded by the cosmological horizon y = y4, the marginal null ray y = y1 with zero
mass, m = 0 and running radii, 0 < r < ∞, by the past null inﬁnity with y = 1, r = ∞
and running mass, 0 < m < ∞, and, ﬁnally, by the future null inﬁnity where y = y4
and both mass and radius are inﬁnite, m, r = ∞.

The global geometry is more sophisticated. The Carter-Penrose conformal diagram
consists of one triangle and two squares. The structure of the triangle boundaries
remains exactly the same (except that now y < 1/2), and we have there the T ∗-region
(with η = const timelike and y = const spacelike). But there appears also the R∗-
region (absent before), with η = const spacelike and y = const timelike inside the

square, boundaries of which are the “new horizons” y = y3 and y = y4. The left hand
side boundary consists of two branches, upper and lower, both at y = y3. The latter is
just the “ﬁrst” null accretion ray with m = 0, C(η) = 0, Φ = 0 and r = 0, while the
upper one, with C = ∞, Φ = 0, is the event horizon matching (and separating) the
R∗-region and the inner T ∗-region (y < y3). The right hand side boundary also consists
of two branches, both at y = y4. The upper one is just the “last” accretion ray with
r = ∞, m = ∞, C(η) = ∞ and Φ = ∞ – this is the future null inﬁnity, while the
lower one is the cosmological horizon matching (and separating) the R∗-region and the
outer T ∗-region (y3 ≤ y4 ≤ 1). The second square (y4 ≤ y ≤ 1) has the same structure
as before, except that now y4 > 1/2. Evidently, such a spacetime is not geodesically
complete. See Fig. 9 for the corresponding Carter-Penrose diagram for Vaidya metric
in the case of “weak” accretion, Gα < 1/16.

4. Conclusion

For exploring of the global geometry for Vaidya problem with a linear growth of the
mass function we found the appropriate coordinate transformation from usual Vaidya
metric to the diagonal one. The advantage of this linear model is the possibility for
ﬁnding of all metric functions and photons geodesics in the exact analytical forms.
This coordinate transformation is useful for construction of the Carter-Penrose conform
diagrams for the corresponding maximum analytic extension of the Vaidya metric with
a linear growth of the black hole mass in the diﬀerent cases, depending on the value
of the energy accretion rate. The corresponding level lines for the temporal and space
coordinates, photons geodesics were deﬁned for these diagrams as well as the lines
r = const. The constructed Carter-Penrose diagrams contain quite diﬀerent spacetime
regions, separated by horizons and marginal lines of coordinate systems. The spacetime
on the constructed diagrams geodesically incomplete because we imposed the physically
reasonable condition of the non-negativity of the running black hole mass, m ≥ 0.
