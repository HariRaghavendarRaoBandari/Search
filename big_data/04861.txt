We detect in real time inter-dot tunneling events in a weakly coupled two electron double quantum
dot in GaAs. At Ô¨Ånite magnetic Ô¨Åelds, we observe two characteristic tunneling times, Td and
Tb, belonging to, respectively, a direct and a blocked (spin-Ô¨Çip-assisted) tunneling. The latter
corresponds to lifting of a Pauli spin blockade and the tunneling times ratio Œ∑ = Tb/Td characterizes
the blockade eÔ¨Éciency. We Ô¨Ånd pronounced changes in the behavior of Œ∑ upon increasing the
magnetic Ô¨Åeld, with Œ∑ increasing, saturating and increasing again. We explain this behavior as
due to the crossover of the dominant blockade lifting mechanism from the hyperÔ¨Åne to spin-orbit
interactions and due to a change in the contribution of the charge decoherence.

Electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots are
promising resources for quantum information processing
[1, 2]. Laterally gated dots [5] are especially attractive
due to the Ô¨Çexibility and scalability [4] of their design,
and the possibility to electrically initialize [5], manipu-
late [6, 7], and measure [8, 9] the slowly relaxing [10, 11]
spin states. Pauli spin blockade (PSB) [12] plays a crucial
role in electrical manipulations. PSB is established when
the conservation of spin blocks a transition from an ex-
cited state, where two electrons in two dots have parallel
spins, to the ground state, where they form a singlet in
one dot. The spin can thus be detected by a local charge
sensor as the presence or absence of a charge transition
[13, 14]. The blockade is lifted by spin Ô¨Çips, limiting the
readout Ô¨Ådelities [15, 16], as well as manipulations and
preparations of quantum states.[17, 18]

In GaAs quantum dots, there are two important
sources of electron spin Ô¨Çips:
the spin-orbit coupling,
and the hyperÔ¨Åne interaction with spins of atomic nu-
clei. Respectively, they dominate the spin relaxation time
T1[19, 20] and decoherence time T2 [21‚Äì23]. Apart from
causing detrimental eÔ¨Äects, both of these can be utilized
in quantum state manipulation as a means of coupling of
the electrical control Ô¨Åelds to spins [24‚Äì27]. It is known
that the relative importance of these two eÔ¨Äects changes
with magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength and orientation [18, 28, 29].
By resolving the direct and spin-Ô¨Çip-assisted inter-dot
tunneling, here we investigate experimentally the limit
these factors impose on the eÔ¨Äectiveness of PSB. We Ô¨Ånd
a crossover in their dominance upon changing the mag-
netic Ô¨Åeld strength, which is fully consistent with our
theory. Our results give guidance on how to increase the

PSB eÔ¨Äectiveness with importance for spin readout ap-
plications.

Our device is a gate deÔ¨Åned lateral double quantum
dot (DQD), Fig. 1(a), weakly tunnel-coupled and iso-
lated from reservoirs, with lead-dot tunneling rates of
order Hz, and the inter-dot tunneling rate of order kHz.
In this regime, where tunnel coupling energies are much
smaller than orbital or charging energies, the two elec-
tron conÔ¨Ågurations span a basis of Ô¨Åve states [30, 31]:
one (02) charge state, the singlet S(02), and four (11)
charge states, the two spin polarized triplets T¬±(11), the
unpolarized triplet T0(11), and the singlet S(11). Here
by (NLNR) we denote the left and right dot occupancies
as NL and NR, respectively. Since the exchange energy
splitting among the (11) charge states is negligible, the
four (11) states are degenerate and, in general, energet-

tween totally mixed spin states in (11) and the S(02) state.
In (b), spin polarized (11) states are energetically split by a
Ô¨Ånite Ô¨Åeld and blocked in the (11) state, having a longer time
to tunnel into the S(02) state.

ically separated from the S(02) state by the detuning
energy ‚àÜ. The nearby charge sensor can discriminate
diÔ¨Äerent charge states [32]. Using gates L and R, we
tune the dot close to the (11)-(02) degeneracy, ‚àÜ ‚âà 0,
by balancing the time averaged occupations of the two
charge conÔ¨Ågurations, and measure the sensor current
Isensor. With the inter-dot tunneling time set above the
time resolution of the sensor, we monitor in this way the
dot charge conÔ¨Åguration in real time.

Figure 2(a) shows random (thermally excited) switch-
ing of charge conÔ¨Ågurations [33] at zero magnetic Ô¨Åeld.
The histogram of (11) to (02) tunneling times plotted
on the upper left panel of Fig. 3 shows that the tunnel-
ing is described by a single time constant T , with the
probability that no tunneling occurs for time Œ¥t being
exp(‚àíŒ¥t/T ). Despite diÔ¨Äerent spin conÔ¨Ågurations of the
(11) states, a single tunneling rate into the (02) singlet
is expected due to the hyperÔ¨Åne Ô¨Åeld of nuclear spins.
Indeed, if described as a Zeeman term of a slowly Ô¨Çuc-
tuating classical magnetic Ô¨Åeld located in the left(right)
dot BL(R)
[34], these quasi-static random Ô¨Åelds in general
couple all Ô¨Åve states. Though the couplings between the
(11) and (02) states are negligible, they are appreciable
among the (11) states (see below). As a consequence, no
matter in which (11) spin state the system starts, within
a few nanoseconds it contains the S(11) state with an
amplitude of order 1 from where it can tunnel to S(02).
As a result, within our time resolution, all (11) states
tunnel out with the same rate and there is no PSB.

The charge switching behavior is diÔ¨Äerent at a large
enough external magnetic Ô¨Åeld B, see Fig. 2(b) for B‚ä• =
1.5 T. In addition to the fast switching as in Fig. 2(a),

state residing time for diÔ¨Äerent in-plane magnetic Ô¨Åelds. Lines
show the Ô¨Åtted linear trend for zero Ô¨Åeld and at short, Td, and
long, Tb, times for Ô¨Ånite Ô¨Åelds (see SM for details of the Ô¨Åtting
procedure).

there are long intervals where the system remains in a
(11) state. This is the Pauli spin blockade: once B > BN ,
the Zeeman energy oÔ¨Äset of the polarized triplets sup-
presses their hyperÔ¨Åne induced admixture with S(11) and
by that their tunneling to S(02). Since T0(11) still mixes
fast with S(11), we expect to see two tunneling times, Tb
for spin-Ô¨Çip-assisted tunneling of spin polarized states,
and Td for direct tunneling of spin unpolarized states.
The two processes are sketched on Fig 1(b), and the his-
tograms plotted in Fig. 3 indeed show bi-exponential dis-
tributions for B|| ‚â• 100 mT.

We have investigated this PSB manifestation as a func-
tion of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld strength. In search for generic
features, we measured for various sample cooldowns,
which can change the shape of the dot, and for both
in-plane and perpendicular magnetic Ô¨Åelds, by which we
isolate the strong orbital eÔ¨Äects of the latter. Due to the
inÔ¨Çuence of the AlGaAs barriers [2], the g-factor is small,
|g‚ä•| < 0.12 for an out-of-plane magnetic Ô¨Åeld, and, as we
Ô¨Ånd from the analysis below, about Ô¨Åve times smaller for
in-plane Ô¨Åelds. (These small values make it easier to an-
alyze the behavior of the rates at small Zeeman energies,
which are pushed to higher magnetic Ô¨Åelds by the small
g-factors.) Because of variations in the measurement con-
ditions, there is little systematic dependence of the tun-
neling times taken individually (see Fig. S2 in Ref. [36]).
This is mostly due to the exponential sensitivity of the
S(11)‚àí S(02) tunneling matrix element œÑ , which is hard
to keep constant during the re-alignement of the states‚Äô
energies required in the measurement course. However,
in plotting the ratio Œ∑ = Tb/Td as in Fig. 4, œÑ drops out
and a clear trend emerges.

From zero to moderate external Ô¨Åelds, Œ∑ behaves as ex-

Ô¨Åeld becomes larger than the nuclear Ô¨Åeld. Here it grows
as Œ∑ ‚àù (B/BN )2, as is well known [20] and can be un-
derstood from a simple perturbation theory (see below).
At higher Ô¨Åelds, however, we Ô¨Ånd that the growth stops
and Œ∑ saturates. This is not completely unnatural, as it
suggests that the PSB eÔ¨Äectiveness is limited by some
process, expected to be eventually the case. However,
moving to even higher Ô¨Åelds, Œ∑ increases again [37]. This
is, however, completely surprising, as it implies that the
limitation disappears.
It is also at odds with the gen-
eral behavior of the spin (inelastic) relaxation time T1
between Zeeman split states, which is known to decrease
with the magnetic Ô¨Åeld (as B‚àí5) as was predicted in the-
ory and conÔ¨Årmed experimentally [10, 19].

To understand this peculiar behavior, it is necessary to
consider several ingredients. To this end, we consider a
Hamiltonian comprising the part deÔ¨Åning the double dot
H0, and the interactions with the external, hyperÔ¨Åne,
and spin-orbit Ô¨Åelds [38, 39]:

H = H0 + HZ + Hnuc + Hso.

(1)

With details in Ref. 36, H0 consists of the electron kinetic
energy, conÔ¨Ånement potential, and Coulomb interaction
and deÔ¨Ånes the Hilbert space as described above, with
the (11) states detuned from S(02) by ‚àÜ and the two
singlets tunnel coupled by œÑ ‚â° (cid:104)S(11)|H0|S(02)(cid:105). The
spin-polarized triplets are oÔ¨Äset by the Zeeman energy
¬±|g¬µBB|, which for our g-factors corresponds to 7 ¬µeV
for B‚ä• = 1 T and 0.7 ¬µeV for B|| = 1 T. A typical
matrix element of Hnuc within the (11) subspace is of
order 0.1 ¬µeV. Finally, assuming Hso contains the linear-
in-momentum Dresselhaus and Rashba terms, the only
non-zero matrix elements are

Here, Œªso is an eÔ¨Äective spin-orbit length, a combination
of the Dresselhaus and Rashba coeÔ¨Écients, and d is half
of the interdot distance, which we estimate to be 130 nm
from typical values of Td [36].

The system dynamics is given by the equation for its

density matrix œÅ,

superpositions of all four (11) states. In this basis, the
remaining oÔ¨Ä-diagonal matrix elements are the tunneling
terms

The last term is due to charge noise, usually dominated
by Ô¨Çuctuating electric Ô¨Åelds of phonons, gate potentials,
impurities, and the charge sensor current.
It leads to
a fast decay of charge superpositions, with the decoher-
ence rate Œì, typically several GHz [40]. Denoting a (11)
state as X, and S(02) as S, the charge decoherence is de-
scribed by (L[œÅ])XS = ‚àíŒìœÅXS, a form independent of the
(11) subspace basis. We use this invariance to simplify
Eq. (3) by choosing basis states |X(cid:105) in which H is diag-
onal within the (11) subspace. Because of the hyperÔ¨Åne

We Ô¨Åt this model to the data on Fig. 4 by averaging

tribution with zero mean value and dispersion B2

Œì, and the spin-orbit length Œªso are Ô¨Åtting parameters.
To take into account the limited accuracy of the detun-
ing and the voltage jitter present in real experiments, we
average over ‚àÜ ‚àà (cid:104)0, 12(cid:105) ¬µeV, a range corresponding to
the electron temperature [41]. However, the inÔ¨Çuence of
‚àÜ on the data Ô¨Åt in Fig. 4 is relatively minor. On the
contrary, BN , Œì, and Œªso have a profound inÔ¨Çuence and
the energy scales connected to these key quantum dot
spin qubit parameters can be directly read oÔ¨Ä from the
magnetic Ô¨Åeld dependence of Œ∑, as we now explain.

Let us Ô¨Årst assume the detuning is zero, and the hyper-
Ô¨Åne Ô¨Åelds are Ô¨Åxed. Using Eqs. (4)‚Äì(6) we get the ratio
of tunneling times of two (11) states X(11) ‚Üî S(02),

Take Ô¨Årst B = 0. As already explained, the hyperÔ¨Åne
Ô¨Åelds fully mix the (11) subspace, so that each eigen-
state typically contains the same amount of admixture
of S(11). Because in addition the Zeeman energy of hy-
perÔ¨Åne Ô¨Åelds is negligible compared to Œì, the ratio in
Eq. (7) is 1. Once B (cid:29) BN , the singlet admixture
into the Zeeman split triplets is small, |(cid:104)X|S(11)(cid:105)|2 ‚àù
N /B2. The remaining two states, typically equally
B2
mixed S(11) and T0(11), have |(cid:104)Y |S(11)(cid:105)|2 ‚àº 1/2. This
gives two tunneling times with the ratio proportional to
B2/B2
N .

The plateau terminating the growth of Œ∑ at higher
Ô¨Åelds (around 0.1 T for B‚ä•) can be understood as the
spin-orbit taking over the hyperÔ¨Åne Ô¨Åeld in the matrix
element in Eq. (4). Indeed, whereas the latter is indepen-
‚àö
dent of B, the former grows linearly, see Eq. (2). This
equation also gives the spin-orbit length as Œªso ‚àº 2d
2Œ∑
with Œ∑ the ratio on the plateau.

Increasing the magnetic Ô¨Åeld further (beyond 1 T for
B‚ä•), Œ∑ starts to grow again in Fig. 4. This can be still
reconciled with Eq. (7), as due to the Ô¨Årst fraction on
its right hand side. Namely, once the Zeeman energy
becomes larger than the decoherence, the spectral overlap
of spin-polarized (11) states and S(02) drops compared to
spin-unpolarized (11) states. The Zeeman energy where
Œ∑ starts increasing for the second time gives therefore the
charge decoherence rate Œì.

The three energy scales extracted visually as just de-
scribed from the slope changes of Œ∑ give the values of
parameters BN , Œªso, and Œì within a factor of order one.
We found that the best way to nail down these factors
quantitatively is straightforward numerics. Namely, for
given values of hyperÔ¨Åne Ô¨Åelds, we diagonalize the 4 √ó 4
Hamiltonian in the (11) subspace numerically, and calcu-
late the rates according to Eq. (5). We average these over
typically 106 hyperÔ¨Åne Ô¨Åelds random conÔ¨Ågurations. Be-
cause we cannot distinguish experimentally all four rates,

4

we deÔ¨Åne in our numerics the ‚Äúblocked(direct)‚Äù rate as
the average of the Ô¨Årst(last) two rates ordered by their
magnitudes.
In this way, we obtain the solid lines in Fig. 4 using
|g|¬µBN = 1.7 ¬µeV, Œì = 7 GHz, and Œªso = 1.1 ¬µm for the
out-of-plane Ô¨Åeld, and Œªso = 1.5 ¬µm for the in-plane Ô¨Åeld.
From the value of BN , we can infer the number of nuclei
within the dot volume [42], N = (AI(I + 1)/g¬µBB)2 ‚âà
1.2 √ó 105, using A = 90 ¬µeV, and I = 3/2. All ex-
tracted values are typical for gated dots in GaAs, that
is N [43], the charge decoherence rate [44, 45], and spin-
orbit lengths [10, 46]. We note that the diÔ¨Äerent values of
the eÔ¨Äective spin-orbit length Ô¨Åtted for in-plane and out-
of-plane magnetic Ô¨Åelds are consistent with directional
anisotropies of Œªso [47], observed in dot spectra [18], and
spin relaxation [48].

We also considered alternative explanations, examin-
ing inelastic (11) to (02) transitions due to a non-dipolar
electric noise, inelastic (T1) transitions within the (11)
subspace, and lifting the spin-blockade by cotunneling.
As none of these can be naturally reconciled with the
data, we give these details only in Ref. [36].

We conclude by suggesting how to increase the PSB ef-
fectiveness. The spin-orbit eÔ¨Äects should be minimized,
what can be achieved by orienting the magnetic Ô¨Åeld
along certain in-plane directions [49], speciÔ¨Åed by set-
ting Œª‚àí1
so = 0 in Eq. (S23) in Ref. [36]. We predict that
the quadratic growth Œ∑ ‚àº B2 will then extend to much
higher Ô¨Åelds and increase to B4 once the Zeeman energy
becomes larger than the charge decoherence rate. Finally,
these properties are to a large extent independent of the
value of the interdot tunneling, increase of which should
therefore boost both direct and blocked rates while pre-
serving their ratio.

Supplemental Information

Here we give details on device characteristics, addi-
tional measurements, and the derivation of formulae. In
Sec. I we give additional information on the device, com-
ment on the g-factor anisotropy, and spontaneous (in-
elastic) spin Ô¨Çip by phonon emission. In Sec. II we show
measurement data demonstrating Pauli spin blockade in
a conÔ¨Åguration where there is a voltage bias across the
dot. In Sec. III we describe the Ô¨Åtting procedure used
to extract the two tunneling times Tb and Td, resulting
in the bi-exponential Ô¨Åts shown in Fig. 3 of the main
text. The rest contains details on the theory. In Sec. IV
we give the explicit form of the two electron double dot
Hamiltonian, the restricted Hilbert space, and the corre-
sponding matrix elements of the hyperÔ¨Åne and spin-orbit
interactions. In Sec. V we derive Eq. (5). In Sec. VI we
comment on alternative explanations of the data we con-
sidered.

I. Additional information on the device

Experimental details

Single electrons are captured by conÔ¨Åning a two-
dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formed in an Al-
GaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs double heterostructure quantum
well with a GaAs width of 7.3 nm for small electron g-
factor. The 2DEG has a carrier density of 2.1 √ó 1011
cm‚àí2, and a mobility of 1.0 √ó 105 cm2/Vs. The upper
(lower) barrier is 95 nm (100 nm) Al0.34Ga0.66As. The
top 65 nm in the upper barrier is doped by Si. The device
is placed in a dilution refrigerator at a base temperature
of 25 mK. The double dot charge conÔ¨Åguration is moni-
tored by measuring a charge sensor current using a room
temperature current ampliÔ¨Åer with a rise-time of 100 ¬µs.

g-factor anisotropy

In Fig. 4 of the main text, the dependence of Œ∑ = Tb/Td
on the magnetic Ô¨Åeld magnitude B shows three crossovers
in the trend. The values of B for these crossovers dif-
fer for in-plane and perpendicular orientation of the Ô¨Åeld
due to the g-factor anisotropy, since the Zeeman energy,
which determines the energy scale of the crossover Ô¨Åelds,
is proportional to the g-factor. The g-factor is reduced
compared to that of the bulk due to the small thickness
of the GaAs layer and Al content of the barriers in our
heterostructure [S1].
The g-factor of the 2DEG used in this work, |g‚ä•| =
0.12, was measured in a perpendicular magnetic Ô¨Åeld us-
ing an electron spin resonance technique [S2]. The ratio

(cid:12)(cid:12)g‚ä•/g||(cid:12)(cid:12) = 5 extracted from the Ô¨Åtted data of Fig. 4 re-
sults in(cid:12)(cid:12)g||(cid:12)(cid:12) = 0.024, which is consistent with the g-factor

anisotropy found in Ref. [S1] and with the fact that the
g-factor of a 2DEG and a dot are comparable, concluded
in Ref. [S2].

EÔ¨Äect of spontaneous phonon emission (inelastic

tunneling)

The electron spin relaxation rate due to spontaneous
phonon emission is known to grow with the magnetic
Ô¨Åeld magnitude. We do not see such an eÔ¨Äect in our
data, observing only an increase of Œ∑ with the Ô¨Åeld mag-
nitude. Also, as we analyze in detail in Sec. VI, such an
inelastic transition within the (11) subspace [for example
T‚àí(11) ‚Üí S(11)] is expected to result in a histogram of
tunneling times qualitatively diÔ¨Äerent from our observa-
tions (being non-linear at long times, see Fig. S3, versus
linear at long times as seen in Fig. 3 of the main text).

The absence of this eÔ¨Äect is most probably due to the
corresponding relaxation time being too long. This, in
turn, is due to the small g-factor in our sample. Based
on the previous works [S3, S4], we estimate the spin in-
elastic relaxation time for the highest Ô¨Åelds we used to
be of the order of seconds. This is much smaller than the
longest inter-dot tunneling times that we observe (and
model as elastic tunnelings), of the order of 100 ms. One
expects that the eÔ¨Äects of inelastic transitions would be-
come appreciable in Œ∑ making the g-factor larger, and/or
the inter-dot tunneling smaller.

II. Pauli spin blockade in a charge diagram

Here we show the charge diagram demonstrating the
Pauli spin blockade in a weak tunnel coupling regime.
To obtain it, we tuned both interdot and dot-lead tun-
neling rates to the order of kHz, applied a voltage of
1.4 mV across the dot, and swept through the displayed
range in gate voltages VL and VR. At zero magnetic Ô¨Åeld
the charge stability diagram shows typical Ô¨Ånite bias tri-
angles, Fig. S5(a), where electrons sequentially tunnel
through the DQD [S5]. The number of tunneling events
per pixel is of the order of one, since the gate voltage
sweep rate is comparable to the tunneling rates. Un-
der such conditions, charge tunneling is observed as a
noisy signal in the diagram. At Ô¨Ånite magnetic Ô¨Åeld, a
trapezoidal region of blocked current is developed at the
base of the triangles, Fig. S5(b), a hallmark of Pauli spin
blockade [S6]. It reÔ¨Çects the trapping of the system in a
polarized triplet state, where the electron cannot transit
across the double dot without a spin Ô¨Çip, corresponding
to blocked tunneling sketched on Fig. 1(b).

7

error of the extracted times Tb/d, deÔ¨Åned by the stan-
dard conÔ¨Ådence interval 95%, was below 1 % therefore,
to make the error bars visible on Fig. 4 we multiplied
them by a factor of 50. This means that the error from
the Ô¨Åtting is negligible compared to other errors (such as
the potential drift due to the 1/f noise, the measurement
errors due to noise in the charge sensor, etc.).

The extracted individual tunneling times, Tb and Td,
have less systematic dependence (Figs. S6(a) and S6(b)
taken for in- and out-of-plane B, respectively), compared
to Fig. 4 where their ratios are plotted. The Ô¨Çuctua-
tions of individual tunneling times are caused by Ô¨Çuctu-
ations of the inter-dot tunnel coupling, in turn due to
the inÔ¨Çuence of implementing changes in B, from delib-
erately changing gate voltages for other purposes in a
related experiment,[S7, S8] from the limited precision in
setting the detuning ‚àÜ to zero, and‚Äîprobably the most
importantly‚Äîfrom the drift of local voltages due to the
1/f noise (it takes approximately 10 minutes to gather
data for a single point in Fig. 4). Except for ‚àÜ, the
above mentioned noise eÔ¨Äects do not appreciably inÔ¨Çu-
ence the ratio Œ∑, since there the inter-dot tunnel coupling
cancels out. The detuning is important if it, accidentally,
matches the Zeeman energy, at which value the S(02)
anti-crosses with T+(11). This lifts the PSB of this spin-
polarized state, and results in a relatively sharp dip in Œ∑.
We took this eÔ¨Äect into account by averaging over a dis-
tribution of ‚àÜ, as described in the main text. A diÔ¨Äerent
probability distribution of ‚àÜ, or its changes in the mea-
surement course, might be the reason for the discrepancy
with the Ô¨Åt, and also for the remaining Ô¨Çuctuations in Œ∑,
which are much larger than the error bars obtained from
the histogram Ô¨Åtting. Particularly, an accidental degen-
eracy of S(02) and T+(11) might be the reason for the
dip and large Ô¨Çuctuations of Œ∑ around B‚ä• ‚âà 1 T.

III. Bi-exponential Ô¨Åtting

We extract the two (blocked and direct) tunneling
times by Ô¨Åtting to a bi-exponential distribution in the
following way. For each value of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld (one
point in Fig. 4) we collect a set of N , typically 103 to
104, individual (11) to (02) tunneling times (such a set is
plotted as a histogram in Fig. 3). We order the tunneling
times in the set in ascending order, labeling them by in-
teger index i = 1, . . . , N , so that ti < ti+1. We deÔ¨Åne the
cumulative probability function Pdata(ti) = i/N , which
describes the probability that no tunneling occurred un-
til time t as 1 ‚àí P (t). In the model where the tunneling
from (11) to (02) proceeds with a rate dependent on the
(11) state (blocked or non-blocked, with initial occupa-
tion probabilities pb and pd, respectively) we have

1 ‚àí Pmodel(t) = pbe‚àít/Tb + pde‚àít/Td ,

(S8)

a sum of two exponential decays weighted by their prob-
abilities. Assuming the system spends an equal amount
of time in the blocked and unblocked conÔ¨Ågurations, we
would have pbTb = 1/Tb + 1/Td, and pdTd = 1/Tb + 1/Td.
However, to allow for possible imbalance and oÔ¨Äset, we
keep all four parameters pb, pd, Tb, and Td as Ô¨Åtting pa-
rameters. The Ô¨Åt means we Ô¨Ånd the values of these pa-
rameters which minimize the following sum

N(cid:88)

i=1

where n is typically set to 0.5‚àº1.5. The value n = 1 cor-
responds to the standard least square Ô¨Åtting of the dis-
crete set of P (ti), whereas we found it useful to introduce
diÔ¨Äerent values of n to weight tunneling times according
to their density. This improves the Ô¨Åt at longer times
where we have fewer tunneling events, without the neces-
sity for Ô¨Åtting from a data histogram, which we found less
robust to extract the slower tunneling rate. The Ô¨Åtting

This form is better suited for a perturbative treat-
ment of the spin-orbit eÔ¨Äects, as was demonstrated in
Refs. [S11, S12]. We note that the transformation leaves
the statistics of the random nuclear Ô¨Åelds unchanged to
all orders of d/Œª, as a local rotation of a quantization axis
is irrelevant for unpolarized spins (only the correlators of
distant spins are diÔ¨Äerent in the original and transformed
frame [S13]).

To calculate the matrix elements of the eÔ¨Äective form
of the spin-orbit interaction, Eq. (S25), we will use the in-
version symmetries of the functions in Eq. (S16). Namely,
in the coordinate system where the x(cid:48) axis is aligned with
d, and y(cid:48) is perpendicular to it, these functions transform

Ix(cid:48)Œ®R(r) = Œ®‚àó

basis functions we consider are

Matrix elements of the spin-orbit interaction

To obtain the spin-orbit interaction matrix elements,
we Ô¨Årst unitarily transform the total Hamiltonian [S9,
S10]

H ‚Üí U‚Ä†(r1)U‚Ä†(r2)HU (r1)U (r2),

(S22)

with a unitary representing a position dependent spin
rotation

expressed through the crystallographic coordinates x, y,
and the spin-orbit lengths Œª. In the leading order of the
small quantity d/Œª, the only eÔ¨Äect of the transformation
is to express the spin-orbit interaction in terms of the
position, rather than momentum, operator. That means,
the transformed Hamiltonian has the same form as the
one in Eq. (1), if the spin-orbit integration is replaced by

so = g¬µb (B √ó nso) ¬∑ œÉ.

(S25)

(cid:19)

This gives Eq. (2) upon identifying

(cid:104)R|x(cid:48)|R(cid:105) = d = ‚àí(cid:104)L|x(cid:48)|L(cid:105),

(S28)

so that the orbital eÔ¨Äects of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld are absent,
apart from a small renormalization of the inter-dot over-
lap ‚Ñ¶, which cancels in Œ∑ anyway. Using this result gives
that the only non-zero matrix element of the eÔ¨Äective
spin-orbit interaction, Eq. (S25), within the subspace of
states in Eq. (S18) is (up to an overall phase coming from
the phase convention of the spinors | ‚Üë(cid:105), | ‚Üì(cid:105))

the derivation of Eq. (2).

V. Derivation of Eq. (5)

As described in the main text, since the form of the
superoperator L in Eq. (3) is invariant to basis changes

within the (11) sector, we choose a basis that diagonal-
izes the Hamiltonian in this sector. This diagonaliza-
tion results in a set of states X, that are deÔ¨Åned by
P (11)HP (11)X = EX P (11)X, with P (11) the projec-
tor on the (11) subspace. It also results in oÔ¨Ä-diagonal
elements given in Eq. (4), which we treat perturbatively.
Assuming that initially the system is in such a state X,
we can neglect all other X(cid:48) states in the lowest order of
the time dependent perturbation theory, since the system
cannot make a direct tunneling X ‚Üí X(cid:48), as there is no
matrix element connecting these states. The only possi-
ble tunneling is to S(02), the rate of which is described
by a 2 by 2 time dependent Hamiltonian

Assuming that the system is initially in state X, and

bation, in the leading order of a time dependent pertur-
bation theory we get

VI. Alternative explanations

We also considered alternative explanations for the be-
havior of the observed rates. First of all, one might imag-
ine that once the blocked tunneling becomes too slow,
some other mechanism, unrelated to hyperÔ¨Åne or spin-
orbit interactions and thus to the magnetic Ô¨Åeld, takes
over in the electron spin relaxation. However, cotunnel-
ing, as the only realistic candidate for such a process we
are aware of, is expected to result in rates well below the
dot-lead rate of 1 Hz which we measured in our dot. Fur-
ther, the data of Fig. S6(b) show that the value of the
blocked tunneling time is not correlated at all with the
appearance and disappearance of the plateau in the ratio
of the rates.

Second, we can extend our model to incorporate in-
elastic tunnelings by adding a noise term, e.g., as a time
dependent eE(r, t)¬∑ r, into Eq. (1). It results in a contri-
bution to the last term in Eq. (5), through the spectral
density E2
XS(œâ), which is in general of a diÔ¨Äerent func-
XS(œâ) ‚àù Œ¥(œâ). Before
tional form than the considered H 2
doing any quantitative estimates, we note that to explain
the plateau in the ratio of the rates, the spectral den-
sity E2
XS(œâ) would have to be quadratic (assuming the
decoherence is low enough such that the Lorentzian de-
nominators cancel). We do not deem this to be a proba-
ble explanation, since neither of the electric noise sources
which are considered relevant for spin relaxation has such
spectral density. Namely, the spectral density of phonons
is cubic (piezoelectric) or œâ5 (deformation potential), the
1/f noise is inversely proportional to œâ and the shot and
thermal noise are frequency independent.
In addition,
the dipolar moment of the Ô¨Çuctuating electric Ô¨Åeld does
not couple S(11) and S(02). It only contributes to the de-
coherence, which our model already takes into account.
We expect the sub-dominant (beyond the dipole) mo-
ments of the noise Ô¨Åelds to be very small.

Third, we examined the possibility that such additional
noise induces inelastic transitions within the (11) sector.
A blocked triplet T¬±(11) in such a scenario Ô¨Årst decays
to the S(11) and only then tunnels to S(02), instead of
making a spin-Ô¨Çip-assisted tunneling directly to S(02).
However, as derived in detail in the following subsec-
tion, we Ô¨Ånd that this leads to a decay described by
pX (t) ‚âà exp(‚àít2/2TdT1), which we could clearly dis-
tinguish from an exponential decay pX (t) = exp(‚àít/Tb)
which we observe for blocked tunnelings.

Inelastic transitions within the (11) sector

If we assume that the principal value term is negligible,
the transition rate from state X to S given in Eq. (5),
follows as ‚àÇtPS(t) from Eq. (S35), with the charge de-
coherence rate given as the spectral density of energy
Ô¨Çuctuations at zero frequency, Eq. (S37).

To examine the eÔ¨Äects of inelastic transitions, we con-
sider a rate equations model for three states, a polarized
triplet denoted as X, and the two singlets, S(11) and
S(02). The corresponding occupation probabilities are
denoted as pX , p11, and p02, respectively. They evolve

would decay to S(11) before it could be observed as be-
ing blocked. For times W (cid:28) 1/t (cid:28) Œ≥ we then get from
the previous equations the result stated in the main text

P11(t) ‚âà exp(cid:0)‚àíW Œ≥t2/2(cid:1) .

(S42)

The histograms of (11) residing times on Fig. 3 cor-
respond to the probability that the tunneling happens
within some interval. According to the previous analysis
the number of observed tunnelings within (t, t + Œ¥t) is
given by

Nb(t, t + Œ¥t) = N0P11(t)Œ≥(cid:0)1 ‚àí exp(‚àíW t)(cid:1)Œ¥t.

This is to be compared with the initial state of the
system in an unblocked (11) state. This situation is de-
scribed by Eqs. (S38) with the state X never occupied
and thus disregarded from considerations. An analogous
calculation gives

, we can simulate a histogram plot assuming,
for illustration, (cid:104)Td(cid:105) = (cid:104)Tb(cid:105)/20, a typical ratio we ob-
serve on the plateau. We get the data plotted on Fig. S7.
Comparing with Fig. 3, it demonstrates that we can ex-
clude the possibility of inelastic transitions being relevant
in our experiment.

FIG. S7. (color online). Histogram simulation. Black solid
(red dashed) line gives the contribution from the blocked (di-
rect) tunneling using Eq. (S45) [Eq. (S43)]. We assumed that
(cid:104)Td(cid:105) = (cid:104)Tb(cid:105)/20, and the time average probability for the sys-
tem to be in a blocked and non-blocked conÔ¨Ågurations is the
same.

according to

‚àÇtpX = ‚àíW pX ,
‚àÇtp11 = W pX + Œ≥(p02 ‚àí p11),
‚àÇtp02 = Œ≥(p11 ‚àí p02).

(S38a)

(S38b)

(S38c)

Our minimal model therefore includes a decay of the
triplet state into S(11) with relaxation rate W = 1/T1
and an unbiased equilibration of the two singlets with
the rate Œ≥, corresponding to the direct inter-dot tunneling
Œ≥ = 1/Td. Let us assume that at time t the S(02) was not
occupied, p02(t) = 0. For time interval Œ¥t short enough,
Œ¥t W, Œ¥t Œ≥ (cid:28) 1, Eqs. (S38) are solved by

(S39a)

pX (t + Œ¥t) = pX (t) exp(‚àíW Œ¥t),
p02(t + Œ¥t) = Œ≥Œ¥t[1 ‚àí pX (t)],

(S39b)
and the normalization p11 = 1 ‚àí p02 ‚àí pX , valid at all
times exactly.

Now we supplement this evolution by an assumption
that the detector measures the system repeatedly with
a rate (bandwidth) 1/Œ¥t, projecting it between (02) and
(11) subspaces. Assuming the system started in (11) sub-
space, the probability that no tunneling is observed up
to time t, P11(t), is governed by the equation
Œ¥P11(t + Œ¥t) = ‚àíP11(t)Œ≥[1 ‚àí pX (t)]Œ¥t,

(S40)
which can be solved, assuming again Œ¥t W, Œ¥t Œ≥ (cid:28) 1, and
the initial condition being the state X occupied, pX (0) =
1, to give

P11(t) = exp
