Abstract

Between the beginning of its full-scale scientiﬁc operations in 2007 and 2012, the VERITAS Cherenkov
telescope array observed more than 130 blazars; of these, 26 were detected as very-high-energy (VHE; E>100
GeV) γ-ray sources. In this work, we present the analysis results of a sample of 114 undetected objects. The
observations constitute a total live-time of ∼ 570 hours. The sample includes several unidentiﬁed Fermi-Large
Area Telescope (LAT) sources (located at high Galactic latitude) as well as all the sources from the second
Fermi-LAT catalog which are contained within the ﬁeld of view of the VERITAS observations. We have also
performed optical spectroscopy measurements in order to estimate the redshift of some of these blazars that do
not have a spectroscopic distance estimate. We present new optical spectra from the Kast instrument on the
Shane telescope at the Lick observatory for 18 blazars included in this work, which allowed for the successful
measurement or constraint on the redshift of four of them. For each of the blazars included in our sample we
provide the ﬂux upper limit in the VERITAS energy band. We also study the properties of the signiﬁcance
distributions and we present the result of a stacked analysis of the data-set, which shows a 4 σ excess.

1. INTRODUCTION

The current generation of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov
telescopes (IACTs), sensitive to very-high-energy (VHE;
E>100 GeV) γ-ray photons, has signiﬁcantly increased our
knowledge of blazars. They represent by far the class of
objects which dominates the VHE extragalactic sky. Among
the 66 extragalactic VHE sources currently detected,1 about
90% of them are blazars.

In the framework of the uniﬁed model of active galactic
nuclei (AGN), blazars are radio-loud AGN, characterized by
a pair of relativistic jets of plasma emitted along the polar
axis of the super-massive black-hole powering the system,
aligned along the line of sight of the observer (see Urry &
Padovani 1995). The observational properties of blazars
include a spectral energy distribution (SED) characterized by
a non-thermal continuum from radio to γ-rays, extreme tem-
poral variability and strong polarization. These properties can
be explained by considering that the emission from the jet,
enhanced by relativistic effects, dominates the SED (Angel
& Stockman 1980). Spectroscopic measurements in optical
and UV reveal that two distinct sub-classes of blazars exist:
BL Lac objects, characterized by a featureless optical/UV
spectrum, and ﬂat-spectrum radio-quasars (FSRQs), which
show instead broad emission lines. The traditional division
between the two classes of objects is an equivalent width of
the emission lines equal to 5 ˚A (see Stickel et al. 1991). The
two sub-classes are also characterized by different luminosity
and redshift distributions.
The FSRQs are on average
brighter and located at higher redshifts (see e.g. Padovani
1992; Massaro et al. 2009). In the uniﬁed AGN model, this
dichotomy is associated with a similar dichotomy seen in
radio-galaxies. FSRQs are considered the blazar version of
FR II radio-galaxies (Fanaroff & Riley 1974), while BL Lac
objects correspond to FR I (Urry & Padovani 1995).

is associated,

Two broad non-thermal components characterize blazar
SEDs. The ﬁrst, peaking between millimeter and X-rays,
is attributed to synchrotron emission by a population of
electrons/positrons in the blazar jet. The second, peaking
in γ-rays,
in leptonic models, with inverse
Compton scattering between the same leptons and their
own synchrotron emission (synchtron-self-Compton model,
SSC, Konigl 1981), or an external photon ﬁeld, such as
the emission from the dusty torus, the accretion disc or the
broad-line-region (see Sikora et al. 1994). Alternatively, in
hadronic scenarios, the second SED component is attributed
to synchrotron emission by protons, or by secondary particles
produced in p-γ interactions (Mücke & Protheroe 2001). The
position of the ﬁrst peak is used to further classify BL Lac
objects into low and high-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects
(LBL/HBL), depending on whether the peak frequency
is located in infrared/optical or UV/X-rays, respectively.
The transition between LBL and HBL is smooth, and a
population of intermediate-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects
exists as well (IBL, with 1014 Hz < νsyn < 1015 Hz, see
Laurent-Muehleisen et al. 1998). While BL Lac objects

present a variety of synchrotron peak frequencies, FSRQs
are almost all characterized by a low-frequency peak. This
classiﬁcation can be seen as a more recent version of the
older classiﬁcation (see e.g. Padovani & Giommi 1995b) of
blazars into radio-selected objects (RBLs, which are more
likely FSRQs and LBLs) and X-ray-selected objects (XBLs,
which are more likely HBLs)2.

The measurement of blazar spectral properties at VHE is
important not only to characterize the blazar emission itself,
but also to indirectly study the extragalactic background-light
(EBL) in the infrared and visible bands due to the absorption
that it causes on VHE photons via e± pair-production, (see
Salamon & Stecker 1998). VHE observations can also be
used to put limits on the strength of the intergalactic magnetic
ﬁeld according to the non-detection of the emission from
the cascade triggered by the interaction of the pairs with the
cosmic-microwave-background (see e.g. Taylor et al. 2011).

Even though the detection and the measurement of the
VHE spectrum of a blazar is of paramount importance for
the comprehension of the physics of relativistic jets in AGN
and for cosmological studies, a non-detection in the VHE
regime can also be extremely useful.
It can constrain the
source emission model, especially when the ﬂux upper-limit
is signiﬁcantly lower than the extrapolation of the Fermi-LAT
(Atwood et al. 2009) measurement in high-energy γ-rays
(HE; 100 MeV<E<100 GeV) up to VHE, implying the
presence of a spectral cut-off.
It can also constrain the
variability properties of the source at VHE if the blazar has
been previously detected or is detected at a later time during a
higher ﬂux state. Additionally, for the upcoming Cherenkov
Telescope Array (CTA, Actis et al. 2011), it will be useful to
have the information from all past observations performed by
the current generation of IACTs, in order to make predictions
for expected outcomes (see e.g. Sol et al. 2013).

All three major IACTs (H.E.S.S., MAGIC and VERI-
TAS) have published upper-limits on blazar VHE emission,
including more than 70 sources in their lists (Aharonian
et al. 2005, 2008b; Aleksi´c et al. 2011a; Aliu et al. 2012;
Abramowski et al. 2014). Past IACTs, such as CAT, HEGRA
and Whipple, have also presented the results from undetected
blazars (Piron 2000; Aharonian et al. 2004; Falcone et al.
2004; Horan et al. 2004), though their limits have in general
been superseded by the current
instruments. At higher
energies, upper limits on blazars have also been estimated
using the air-shower technique with Milagro (Williams 2005).

The study of blazars is complicated by the uncertainty in
their redshifts. In fact, the almost featureless spectra of BL
Lac objects imply that a redshift estimate can be obtained
only via absorption features from the host galaxy or clouds
in the intergalactic medium, or via molecular emission lines
(see Fumagalli et al. 2012), or via a less precise photometric
estimate (comparing the luminosity of the host galaxy to
samples of giant elliptical galaxies).
If the blazar belongs
to a group of galaxies, its redshift can also be estimated by
studying the non-active companions (see Muriel et al. 2015).
2 The classiﬁcation of BL Lac objects as LBL/IBL/HBL is sometimes re-
placed by LSP/ISP/HSP (low/intermediate/high-synchrotron-peaked blazars,
see Abdo et al. 2010b), making explicit reference to the synchrotron origin
of the ﬁrst component of the SED. For BL Lac objects, the two triplets of
acronyms can be considered as synonyms.

Upper limits from ﬁve years of VERITAS blazar observations

3

For VHE studies, the knowledge of the redshift of the blazar
is very important, because the absorption by the EBL in-
creases with the distance of the object. Currently, the farthest
detected VHE blazar is the gravitationally-lensed quasar S3
0218+357 (Mirzoyan 2014b) at z = 0.944, closely followed
by the FSRQ PKS 1441+25 (Ahnen et al. 2015; Abeysekara
et al. 2015) at z = 0.939, while the farthest, persistent (i.e.
detected not only during episodic ﬂaring activity) VHE
blazar is PKS 1424+240 (z > 0.61, see Acciari et al. 2010;
Furniss et al. 2013; Archambault et al. 2014). To improve
the constraints on the distance of some VHE candidates, new
redshift estimates obtained with the Kast spectrograph at Lick
Observatory (see Section 2 and Appendix A) are presented
together with the VHE upper limits from VERITAS.

In this paper we present the results of the analysis of most
of the non-detected blazars observed by VERITAS from
2007 (the beginning of full-scale scientiﬁc operations) to
August 2012 (before the upgrade of the VERITAS array, see
Kieda 2013). VERITAS upper limits on six VHE candidates
were presented by Aliu et al. (2012). The sample also
includes several unidentiﬁed Fermi-LAT objects (located at
high Galactic latitude, and most probably associated with
unidentiﬁed AGN, see Ackermann et al. 2012a; Mirabal et al.
2012; Doert & Errando 2014).

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we provide
the details of the properties of the sample and the source
selection;
the details of the VERITAS data analysis and
results are provided in Section 3; a stacked analysis of the
data is presented in Section 4, studying the full data-set as
well as sub-data-sets deﬁned by redshifts and blazar classes;
the conclusions are in Section 5.

2. THE SAMPLE AND NEW REDSHIFT ESTIMATES
Blazars targeted by VERITAS as VHE source candidates
were selected according to a variety of criteria. Early source
selections were based on blazar X-ray or radio catalogs,
while more recent candidates have also been selected on the
basis of their Fermi-LAT spectral characteristics (Abdo et al.
2009a, 2010a; Nolan et al. 2012) or on their association with
clusters of HE γ-rays (see Archambault et al. 2013). The
target list includes:

• all the nearby (z < 0.3) HBL/IBL recommended as po-
tential VHE emitters by Stecker et al. (1996); Perlman
(2000) and Costamante & Ghisellini (2002)

• the X-ray brightest nearby (z < 0.3) HBL in the Seden-
tary (Giommi et al. 2005) and ROXA (Turriziani et al.
2007) surveys

• four distant (z > 0.3) BL Lac objects recommended
by Costamante & Ghisellini (2002) and Costamante
(2007)

• all nearby (z < 0.3) blazars detected by EGRET

(Mukherjee 2001)

• several FSRQs recommended as potential VHE emit-

ters by Perlman (2000) and Padovani et al. (2002)

• two high-frequency-peaked FSRQs (B2 0321+33 and
Mrk 1218, see Perlman 2000; Falcone et al. 2004),

which have also been classiﬁed as Seyfert-1 galaxies
(see Osterbrock & Dahari 1983; Abdo et al. 2009b)

• the brightest Fermi-LAT sources after extrapolation
into the VERITAS energy band (Abdo et al. 2009a,

similar

In addition, several targets have been observed by VER-
ITAS only as targets of opportunity (ToO), following ﬂare
alerts by multi-wavelength partners (see Errando 2011).

The sources included in our sample are listed in Table 1
(for sources without VHE detection, 82 targets) and Table
2 (for known VHE emitters, detected by other instruments,
or by VERITAS after 2012 and during ﬂaring activity, 11
targets). Sources are listed in order of increasing Right
Ascension (R.A.). For every target, we indicate the name, the
coordinates (R.A. and Dec, in J2000), the catalog redshift z,
the blazar class, the VERITAS dead-time corrected exposure
(see Section 3),
the average zenith angle of VERITAS
observations, the dates of VERITAS observations (in MJD)
and on which basis the source was selected as a VHE can-
didate. Names and coordinates are taken from the SIMBAD
database.3 The references for the redshift estimates (and their
uncertainties) and the blazar class are provided in the table
notes. For every source, the archival SED from the ASDC
SED Builder tool4 has been visually inspected.
It is used
to classify all BL Lac objects marked as HBLs. The total
number of hours of VERITAS data analyzed is about 570,
which represents about 60% of a single VERITAS yearly
observing season, i.e. about one tenth of all good quality
VERITAS data taken from 2007 to 2012.

The ﬁeld-of-view (FoV) of the VERITAS telescope array
is about 3.5◦ and for every observation there is a chance that,
in addition to the targeted blazar, other γ-ray sources are
contained within the FoV. For every target included in our
sample we checked if other known γ-ray sources (included
in the 2-year Fermi-LAT catalog, 2FGL, see Nolan et al.
2012) were present in the FoV. Twenty-one 2FGL sources
were indirectly observed by VERITAS through proximity to
the blazar of interest, and are listed in Table 3. We indicate
as well the counterpart name (from the 2FGL catalog), the
coordinates (R.A. and Dec) of the counterpart, the redshift
and the blazar sub-class (if known). The majority of these
additional 2FGL sources are AGN without classiﬁcation.

2.1. New redshift measurements

In order to measure the distance of some γ-ray blazars, we
observed 18 of the VERITAS targets using the dual-arm Kast
spectrograph at the Cassegrain focus of the Shane telescope
at Lick Observatory. For all the observations presented here,
the instrument was conﬁgured with the 600/4310 grism
on the blue arm, and the 600/7500 grating on the red arm,
the D55 dichroic, and a 2(cid:48)(cid:48) slit. The dichroic crossover

4 http://tools.asdc.asi.it/SED/

4
creates an instrumental gap located at ∼5500 ˚A and affects
approximately 200 ˚A of the spectrum. In the spectroscopic
ﬁgures A1 - A6 (Appendix A), this gap is shown on each
spectrum. While the absolute ﬂuxes are shown in the plots,
the ﬂux calibration is the least certain aspect of the spectra.
In several spectra there is a gap in ﬂux across the dichroic;
this is purely the result of calibrations and is not intrinsic
to the AGN. The wavelength coverage is from ∼3450 ˚A to
∼8000 ˚A, but tellurics and fringing mask features above
6850 ˚A. We do not show this contaminated portion in the
spectra. The targets, observation dates and exposures are
summarized in Table A1. The corresponding standard star
and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) are also included in this
table. The data were reduced following standard techniques
with the Low-Redux pipeline5. Each spectrum was inspected
visually for absorption or emission features. Features are
noted in the spectral plots, Figures A1 - A6, and in Table
A1. For 14 of the sources observed, there are no spectral
features that allow redshift measurements or redshift limits.
By deﬁnition, BL Lac objects have no or weak spectral lines,
so this high rate of non-detections is somewhat expected.
Below are the sources for which features were found that
allow for redshift determinations (see Figure A1):

• RGB J0250+172

Observations of the source were obtained on August
15, 2010 (UT) and resulted in the detection of galac-
tic features at z = 0.243. We detected Ca II (H, equiv-
alent width (EW) = 870 ± 160 m ˚A; K, EW = 1340 ±
190 m ˚A), G band (EW = 650 ± 180 m ˚A) and Mg I
(EW = 530± 120 m ˚A) absorption.
In the literature, Bauer et al. (2000) quotes a redshift
of z=1.10 for RGB J0250+172; however, there is no
information on spectroscopic lines provided within the
reference. Nilsson et al. (2003) presents optical images
of BL Lac objects, including RGB J0250+172. They
ﬁnd that the object is clearly resolved and state that
z = 1.10 is too high because it results in a host galaxy
that is exceedingly bright (MR < −29.0). Based on
ﬁts to the observed light proﬁle, a redshift estimate
of z = 0.25 is provided, which is similar to the value
measured within this work.

• 1ES 1118+424

Observations of the source were obtained on Febru-
ary 14, 2013 (UT) and resulted in the detection of
galactic features at z = 0.230. We detected Ca II (H,
EW = 11500± 1500 m ˚A; K, EW = 13000± 1700 m ˚A),
G band (EW = 3790 ± 862 m ˚A), Ca I (EW = 1208 ±
199 m ˚A) and Mg I (EW = 2896± 254 m ˚A) absorption
lines.
In the literature,
the redshift for 1ES 1118+424 is
quoted as z = 0.124 from a private communication
(see Falomo & Kotilainen 1999). However, Falomo &
Kotilainen (1999) derive a lower limit of z > 0.5 based
on images taken using the Nordic Optical Telescope,
where the source is unresolved. They simulate an

5 http://www.ucolick.org/~xavier/LowRedux/

elliptical host galaxy with MR = −23.8 and an effective
radius of 10 kpc to determine the lowest redshift
at which it would not be resolved. These galactic
parameters are what they ﬁnd from other BL Lac
objects in their study, and they note that assuming a
less luminous and smaller host galaxy would result in
a lower redshift estimate.

• RBS 1366 (=1E 1415+25.9)

Observations of the source obtained on May 30, 2014
(UT) resulted in the detection of galactic features at z =
0.237. We detected Ca II (H, EW = 1300± 130 m ˚A; K,
EW = 1570± 140 m ˚A), G band (EW = 210± 160 m ˚A),
Ca I (EW = 710 ± 64 m ˚A) and Mg I (EW = 1900 ±
100 m ˚A) absorption.
Halpern et al. (1986) also measure a redshift of
z = 0.237 based on Ca II, G band, Fe I, Mg I and
Na absorption. This source displays the signiﬁcant
variability associated with BL Lac objects.
The
spectrum taken in 2013 has a lower overall ﬂux than
the spectrum taken in 2014 (see Table A1), indicating
that the source might have been in different ﬂux states.

• 1ES 2321+419

Observations of the source obtained on October 28,
2014 (UT) resulted in the detection of absorption fea-
tures at z = 0.267. We detected Ca II (H, EW = 260±
47 m ˚A; K, EW = 180 ± 52 m ˚A) and Mg II (2796 ˚A,
EW = 740± 83 m ˚A; 2803 ˚A, EW = 510± 67 m ˚A) ab-
sorption. Because the Ca II absorption is narrow, and
there are no other galactic features, only a lower limit
can be set on the redshift of the source. Additionally,
there is potentially Mg II absorption at a higher red-
shift, z = 0.346.
In the literature, Falomo & Kotilainen (1999) derive
a lower limit for this source of z > 0.45 using the
same technique as for 1ES 1118+424. While our
value is not inconsistent, it is considerably lower than
that placed based on assumptions about the host galaxy.

3. VERITAS OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS
The VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Tele-
scope Array System) telescope array is composed of four
IACTs of 12-m diameter each, located at the Fred Lawrence
Whipple Observatory, on the slopes of Mount Hopkins, in
southern Arizona (31◦ 40(cid:48) N, 110◦ 57(cid:48) W). Each telescope
has a segmented mirror which focuses light onto a camera
composed of 499 photomultipliers located at
the focal
plane. The instrument FoV is 3.5◦. For further details on the
VERITAS instrument see Holder et al. (2006); Holder (2011).

The telescopes measure the faint Cherenkov light induced
by the electromagnetic showers triggered by the interaction
of the γ-ray photons with the Earth atmosphere. Similar
cascades triggered by cosmic rays are also detected by
VERITAS, and can be rejected by applying speciﬁc cuts on

d See Tables 1 and 2 for information on the exposure and the zenith angle of the observations.

The results presented in this paper have been obtained using
a set of γ-hadron separation cuts speciﬁcally optimized for
the detection of soft spectrum sources (differential spectrum
parametrized by a power-law function dN/dE = N(E/E0)−Γ
with Γ = 3.5). The spectral index assumed is in line with the
typical value of Γ observed for VHE blazars (see ¸Sentürk
et al. 2013).

All the observations presented in this paper were made us-
ing the ‘wobble’ observing strategy (Fomin et al. 1994). Here,
the telescopes point 0.5◦ away from the target, alternatively
in each of the four cardinal directions, to enable background
estimation from the same ﬁeld of view. This procedure
ensures a similar acceptance for both the source (ON) and
the background (OFF) regions. Regions overlapping bright
stars are excluded from background estimates. The ratio of
the ON over the OFF region size deﬁnes the background
normalization parameter α. The dead time of the telescope
array is explicitly calculated and is approximately 10% for the
observations described here. The exposure values provided
in Table 1 are all corrected for dead time, and represent the
effective live-time of VERITAS observations.

The VERITAS observations here have an average length of
twenty minutes (referred to as a run), before switching targets
or wobble directions. For quality assurance all the runs
with a length lower than ten minutes were excluded, often
being associated with technical problems, resulting in the
early termination of the run. Additionally, all observations
characterized by non-optimal weather conditions or malfunc-
tioning hardware were excluded from the run selection. On
certain occasions one of the VERITAS telescopes can be non-
operational due to technical problems; all the runs analyzed
in this paper have at least three telescopes in operation. Runs
with all four telescopes in operation represent the bulk (92%)
of the data.

In the standard conﬁguration, VERITAS observations are
not performed under bright-moonlight conditions (Moon
illumination > 35% of full Moon). Since 2012, the VERITAS
collaboration has started a new observing program in order
to extend the duty cycle of the observatory and perform
observations also under bright moonlight (Archambault et al.
2015). None of the data presented in this paper were taken
under bright moonlight conditions. Observations performed
under moderate moonlight (Moon illumination < 35%) are
included, and analyzed in the same manner as dark-time
observations, with appropriate instrument response functions
to account for the increased night-sky background.

The signiﬁcance at the source location is computed using
Equation 17 in Li & Ma (1983). The upper limit on the VHE
ﬂux is estimated according to Rolke et al. (2005) at the 99%
conﬁdence level. It is ﬁrst calculated assuming three different
values of the spectral index (Γ = 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5) in order to
estimate the decorrelation energy Edec (the energy at which
the upper limit estimate depends the least on the spectral
index). The upper limit is then recomputed at the reference
energy Edec assuming a spectral index Γ = 3.5. The threshold
of the analysis (which depends mainly on the zenith angle
of the observations) is also calculated. For every source we
veriﬁed that, not only the overall signiﬁcance is lower than 5
standard deviations (σ), but that no ﬂares have been detected,
i.e.
that none of the sources was detected at more than 4σ
during any single run.

For sources which are detected by Fermi-LAT (76% of
the sample),
the ﬂux is extrapolated into the VERITAS
energy band, taking into account the absorption from the
EBL using the model by Franceschini et al. (2008), which is
in agreement with the most recent observational constraints
(Abramowski et al. 2013b). The extrapolated ﬂux is then
compared to the VERITAS upper limit.
If the VERITAS
measurement is lower than the extrapolation, it means that

10

an additional cut-off should be present in the γ-ray compo-
nent between the Fermi-LAT and the VERITAS energy bands.

The results of the analysis are reported in Tables 4 and 5
(for known VHE sources) and 6 (for 2FGL sources in the
VERITAS ﬁeld of view). For every target, we provide the
signiﬁcance, the number of ON and OFF counts, the value of
the α parameter (ratio of the ON over OFF region size), the
threshold of the analysis Eth, the decorrelation energy Edec,
the differential ﬂux upper limit at Edec, the integral ﬂux upper
limit (above Eth, provided in Crab units, following Hillas
et al. 1998)6, the ratio between the VERITAS differential
upper limit and the extrapolation of the Fermi-LAT detection
(ΦHE, evaluated at Edec). Note that the values of the decorre-
lation and threshold energies are provided with three decimal
values to ease any extrapolation to other energy bands, but
they are known only to the second decimal value.

All the results presented in this paper have been cross-
checked using a separate analysis, which provided consistent
results for the single upper limit values, signiﬁcance distribu-
tions (Section 3.2) and stacked analysis (Section 4).

3.1. Notes on individual sources

Among the blazars targeted by VERITAS between 2007
and 2012, eleven of them were later identiﬁed as VHE emit-
ters. They are listed in Table 2. The VERITAS upper lim-
its are useful in these cases to constrain the properties of the
VHE emission during low-ﬂux states, as well as the variabil-
ity properties of the source. The discussion of these blazar
observations, in order of R.A., follows:
• 1ES 0033+595 (HBL, z = 0.086 :)

VHE emission from 1ES 0033+595 was discovered by
MAGIC (Aleksi´c et al. 2015a). The ﬂux, measured
from 24 hours of observations taken from August to
October 2009, is 0.9% Crab above 290 GeV7. The ob-
served spectral index during the MAGIC observations
is 3.8 ± 0.7. The VERITAS upper limit (5.4% Crab
above 290 GeV) is fully consistent with the MAGIC
measurement. The VHE variability of the source has
been demonstrated by more recent VERITAS observa-
tions, which detected a bright VHE ﬂare (with inte-
gral ﬂux higher than 10% Crab) from the source during
September 2013, with simultaneous X-ray and ultravi-
olet coverage by Swift (Benbow 2015). A paper pre-
senting the results of this multi-wavelength campaign
is currently in preparation.

• RGB J0152+017 (HBL, z = 0.08)

This source has been known as a VHE emitter since

6 The best-ﬁt of the VHE emission from the Crab Nebula as measured
with the Whipple 10-m telescope and presented in Hillas et al. (1998) is a
power-law function with index Γ = 2.49 and normalization K = 3.2× 10−11
cm-2s-1TeV-1 at 1 TeV. The integral upper limits are computed from the dif-
ferential ones and provided here as a reference. They can easily be recom-
puted for different values of Eth, or for other deﬁnitions of the Crab unit.
For example, using as a reference the MAGIC spectrum of the Crab nebula
(Aleksi´c et al. 2015b), the Crab unit above 200 GeV is 74% of the Whipple
Crab unit above the same threshold.

7 In order to ease the comparison between the results from different in-
struments, the integral ﬂuxes provided in this section have been recomputed
above the VERITAS threshold, when the spectral information is available,
and are expressed in Crab units as deﬁned in Hillas et al. (1998).

2008 (Aharonian et al. 2008a), when it was detected by
H.E.S.S. at a ﬂux of 2.6% Crab above 240 GeV, dur-
ing 15 hours of observation. VERITAS observed the
blazar in three different seasons: 2007-2008 (covering
the H.E.S.S. period), 2010-2011 and 2011-2012. The
VERITAS upper limit (3.6% Crab above 240 GeV) is
fully consistent with the H.E.S.S. detection.

• RGB J0847+115 (HBL, z = 0.198)

VHE emission from this blazar was announced by
MAGIC in 2014, at a ﬂux corresponding to 2.5% Crab
above 200 GeV (Mirzoyan 2014c). No spectral infor-
mation is currently available, but the MAGIC collabo-
ration reported a preliminary classiﬁcation of the source
as an extreme-HBL, with synchrotron peak-frequency
in hard-X-rays, and inverse-Compton peak-frequency
at TeV energies. Evidence of VHE and optical variabil-
ity was also claimed by MAGIC. The VERITAS upper
limit (2.0% of the Crab Nebula ﬂux above 180 GeV)
is marginally consistent with the preliminary ﬂux esti-
mate by MAGIC, and could be related to variability of
the VHE emission.

• RX J1136.5+6737 (HBL, z = 0.134)

The MAGIC collaboration recently reported the detec-
tion of this source at a ﬂux of 1.5% Crab above 200
GeV, in 20 hours of observations between January and
April 2014 (Mirzoyan 2014a). No spectral information
is available at the present time. The VERITAS upper
limit (5.2% Crab above 290 GeV) is fully consistent
with the preliminary ﬂux estimate by MAGIC.

• PKS 1222+216 (FSRQ, z = 0.432)

VHE emission from this FSRQ was detected by
MAGIC in 2010 at a ﬂux of the order of the Crab
Nebula ﬂux (Aleksi´c et al. 2011b). The detection of
this VHE ﬂare is of paramount importance for blazar
physics:
the rapid variability, and the fact that VHE
photons can escape the bright photon ﬁeld present in
FSRQs was used to put constraints on the location of
the γ-ray emitting region in blazars. The VERITAS
non-detection constrains the low-ﬂux state at a level of
2.2% Crab above 180 GeV.
During May 2014, PKS 1222+216 underwent another
γ-ray ﬂare, and VERITAS detected VHE emission at a
ﬂux of 3% Crab (Holder 2014a). A paper describing the
VERITAS detection in 2014 is currently in preparation.

• 3C 279 (FSRQ, z = 0.536)

This quasar is the ﬁrst of its class detected as a VHE
emitter (Albert et al. 2008). VERITAS observations
during 2011 were triggered by ﬂaring activity observed
at lower wavelengths (optical, X-rays and HE γ-rays).
The same ﬂare triggered observations with the MAGIC
telescopes (Aleksi´c et al. 2014c), which resulted as well
in no VHE detection (ﬂux upper limit equal to 1.7%
Crab above 260 GeV). The VERITAS ﬂux upper limit
(2.1% Crab above 260 GeV) is similar to the one mea-
sured with the MAGIC telescopes.
• PKS 1510-089 (FSRQ, z = 0.361)

Two VHE ﬂares from this quasar have been reported so
far: the ﬁrst during March-April 2009, seen by H.E.S.S.
(around 0.6% of the Crab Nebula ﬂux above 260 GeV,

Upper limits from ﬁve years of VERITAS blazar observations

see Abramowski et al. 2013a), the second during Febru-
ary 2012, seen by MAGIC (around 1% of the Crab
Nebula ﬂux above 260 GeV, see Aleksi´c et al. 2014b).
The VERITAS observations presented in this paper are
quasi-simultaneous with both ﬂares (see Table 2 for de-
tails). For the 2009 ﬂare, VERITAS observations were
taken a few days before the VHE ﬂare seen by H.E.S.S..
For the 2012 ﬂare, VERITAS observations were taken
every night from February 19 to February 27, cover-
ing the Fermi-LAT ﬂare. The VERITAS upper limit is
2.9% of the Crab Nebula ﬂux above 260 GeV.

• RGB J1725+118 (HBL, z > 0.35)

The discovery of VHE emission from this blazar was
recently reported by MAGIC (Cortina 2013) at a ﬂux of
2% Crab above 140 GeV during observations in May
2013 triggered by an elevated optical state. No spec-
tral information is available at the present time. The
VERITAS upper limit (3.2% Crab above 200 GeV) is
consistent with the MAGIC measurement.

• 0FGL J2001.0+4352 (HBL, z = 0.18 :)

Early results from Fermi-LAT indicated that this source
was a good candidate for IACTs, in particular due to its
hard GeV spectrum (Abdo et al. 2009a). The MAGIC
collaboration detected the source at a ﬂux of ∼ 10%
Crab during a single night (1.4 hours on July 16, 2010,
see Aleksi´c et al. 2014a). The VERITAS upper limit
clearly indicates that this blazar is variable at VHE, and
that its baseline ﬂux is below 5.2% Crab above 200
GeV.

• RGB J2243+203 (HBL, z > 0.39)

VHE emission from this source was detected by VERI-
TAS during December 2014, following a trigger from
a high Fermi-LAT ﬂux (Holder 2014b; Abeysekara
2015). Preliminary analysis indicates that the ﬂux from
the ﬂaring blazar was at ∼ 4% Crab above 180 GeV.
The upper limits computed from 2009 observations in-
dicate that the VHE emission from this source is vari-
able, being signiﬁcantly lower (2.1% Crab above 170
GeV) than the 2014 detection.
• B3 2247+381 (HBL, z = 0.119)

This source was detected by MAGIC in 14 hours of
observations from September to October 2010, at a
ﬂux of 2.2% Crab above 170 GeV (Aleksi´c et al.
2012). The MAGIC observations were triggered by a
high optical state, and there is evidence of variability
in the simultaneous X-ray light curve. VERITAS
observations do not cover the MAGIC detection, nor
the high optical ﬂux state measured by the Tuorla
observatory. The non-detection by VERITAS (ﬂux
upper limit equal
to 1.8% Crab above 170 GeV)
constrains the low-state ﬂux of this blazar to be lower
than the MAGIC detection, suggesting that it may have
been related to a VHE high-ﬂux state.

In addition to these known VHE emitters, we discuss a few

other targets with noteworthy histories:
• 1ES 0037+405 (HBL, z unknown)

VERITAS observations of this target were taken as
a self-triggered ToO. During observations of the An-
dromeda galaxy (M31, see Bird 2015), a 4σ hotspot

coincident with this blazar was observed in the recon-
structed sky-map. However, further observations did
not conﬁrm the hotspot, and the cumulative signiﬁcance
is 1.5σ in 36 hours.

• OJ 287 (LBL, z = 0.306)

This blazar is one of the most studied objects of its kind
due to a clear periodicity in its optical lightcurve, with
a period of about twelve years. The VERITAS observa-
tions presented in this work cover the last active phase
in Fall 2007 (from December 4, 2007 to January 1,
2008), with additional observations during 2010. The
VHE upper limits are comparable to the ones measured
with the MAGIC telescopes and presented by Seta et al.
(2009).

• 1FGL J1323.1+2942 (FSRQ, z unknown) and

RX J1326.2+2933 (HBL, z = 0.431)
Although the angular distance between the two sources
is only 43(cid:48), they are not the same blazar. VERITAS
can resolve the two objects, and they have been targeted
by VERITAS independently (see last column of Table
1). Since they are well within the VERITAS FoV, the
exposures on these two objects have been merged into
a single dataset.

• B2 0912+29 (HBL, z = 0.36)

This blazar shows the highest signiﬁcance in our
dataset (3.5σ in 11.7 hours). This excess was con-
ﬁrmed at the same signiﬁcance level by the cross-check
analysis chain. Further observations were taken during
the 2013 and 2014 observing seasons, but the initial
excess did not increase. While VHE blazars are known
to be variable, and one could interpret the lack of a
detection in 2013-2014 as due to variability, we also
note that the probability of a 3.5σ excess reduces to
only 2.0σ when 103 trials (the sources from Tables 1
and 3) are taken into account, and it is thus not enough
to make any claim.

3.2. Signiﬁcance distributions

In Fig. 1 we present the distribution of the signiﬁcances
for all the sources presented in our work. Given that the
blazar population at VHE is not homogeneous (see the
Introduction), and depends on both the blazar sub-class
(which is correlated with the energy of the high-energy SED
peak) and the blazar redshift (which implies a different level
of EBL absorption), signiﬁcance distributions are produced
as a function of these two parameters. For the redshift
division (left plot of Fig. 1), redshifts lower or higher than 0.6
were considered, along with unknown redshift. Concerning
the division of blazar sub-classes (right plot of Fig. 1), the
sources were categorized as HBLs, IBLs/LBLs/FSRQs, and
blazars of unknown type. The Gaussian distribution expected
from a sample with average ˆX = 0 and σ = 1 is overlaid
on the signiﬁcance distribution. A ﬁt of the histogram
with a Gaussian function instead yields ˆX = 0.3 ± 0.1 and
σ = 1.2± 0.1.

4. STACKED ANALYSIS

Motivated by the skew in the signiﬁcance distribution and
in order to study if there is any evidence of emission from a
population of blazars below the VERITAS sensitivity level,
a stacked analysis of the data-set is performed. For every
source the γ-ray excess (ON - α OFF) and its uncertainty
(the excess divided by the signiﬁcance) are calculated. We
then compute the sum of the excesses, and its uncertainty
(the square root of the sum of the squared uncertainties),
whose ratio provides the signiﬁcance of the stacked excess.
Sources known as VHE emitters are excluded from the
stacked analysis, which only includes sources listed in Tables
1 and 3.

The stacked analysis indicates that there is evidence of
VHE emission at a level of 4.0σ, corresponding to an excess
of 1990 γ-rays. The same study is then performed for
sub-samples of the overall data-set. The majority of the
excess (3.0σ) comes from nearby (z < 0.6) HBLs. On the
other hand, the stacked analysis including only non-HBL
sources located at an unknown distance or z > 0.6 results in a
stacked signiﬁcance of 1.1σ. However, because nearby HBLs
are considered the most likely VHE candidates, there are
more of them and they often have deeper exposures. So this
study has more sensitivity to the nearby HBLs. Indeed, the
VERITAS exposure on HBLs located at z < 0.6 is about 196
hours. By assuming that the 4.0σ stacked excess comes from
a constant signal from all sources in 570 hours, one would
expect a 2.3σ excess in 196 hours. The excess from the
z < 0.6 HBLs is thus compatible with this expectation, and it
is not possible to claim that the stacked excess is dominated
by a particular blazar population.

The MAGIC collaboration has also reported evidence
for VHE emission from a stacked sample of IBL/HBL
sources (Aleksi´c et al. 2011a), detecting a signal at a
signiﬁcance level of 4.9σ from an exposure of 394 hours.
The following sources
included in the present work
are also part of the MAGIC sample:
1ES 0120+340,
1RXS J044127.8+150455, 1ES 0927+500, 1ES 1028+511,
RX J1117.1+2014, RX 1136.5+6737, and RBS 1366. The
four sources with the highest signiﬁcance in the MAGIC
publication (1ES 0033+595, 1ES 1011+496, B2 1215+30,
and 1ES 1741+196) were, notably, later conﬁrmed as VHE
emitters, either during ﬂaring activity, or by increasing the
integration time.

5. CONCLUSIONS

The results from the analysis of the observations of
non-detected blazars targeted by VERITAS from 2007 to
2012 have been presented. In addition, γ-ray sources from
the 2FGL catalog which were within the ﬁeld of view of
these VERITAS observations were included in this study.
For all the 114 sources included in this data-set we provided
the VERITAS upper limit at VHE. Given that the redshift
estimate of blazars is particularly important for VHE extra-
galactic astronomy, due to the γ-ray absorption on the EBL,
we also presented the results from optical spectroscopy of 18
of these targets, determining the redshift for three of them,
and providing a lower limit for the redshift of one of the

sources.

We have presented the results from a stacked analysis of
the data-set, showing that there is some evidence of signal
with a signiﬁcance level of 4σ.

In the near future, the sensitivity of VHE astronomy will
be signiﬁcantly increased thanks to the Cherenkov Telescope
Array (CTA), which will be capable of detecting sources
with VHE ﬂuxes of the order of 0.001 Crab units, about a
factor of ten better than current IACTs (Actis et al. 2011).
Among the scientiﬁc goals of CTA, an important endeavor
will be to increase the number of known VHE blazars in
order to perform population studies. Among the VERITAS
targets presented in this work, the sources with the highest
signiﬁcance could be considered as primary candidates for
observations with CTA, which may be able to detect many
of them on the basis of the extrapolation of their Fermi-LAT
spectra to higher energies. The non-detection of a number of
later detected VHE blazars emphasizes the variable nature
of these sources, highlighting the importance of monitoring
observations in order to increase the likelihood of catching
the sources at detectable VHE states.

APPENDIX

A. NEW REDSHIFT ESTIMATES

In this appendix, we present optical spectra of 18 blazars taken at Lick Observatory in an attempt to spectroscopically measure
their redshift. The sources selected for spectroscopy were selected independently from the sources selected in the main text, so
the overlap is not complete. The spectra we show were taken between August, 2010 and October, 2014. During the observations
at Lick we often observed the same source more than once. Duplicate observations are noted in Table A1, but we only show one
spectrum per source in the ﬁgures. Four of these spectra (shown in Figure A1) have host galaxy features which allow an accurate
redshift determination, and are discussed in the main text.

b This is the average signal to noise per pixel. The ﬁrst number is for the blue side CCD, between 3500 and 5400 A. The second number is for the red side
CCD, between 5700 and 6800 Angstroms
cSeveral targets have spectra from multiple nights. Only one spectrum per target is shown; this column indicates the corresponding ﬁgure, if applicable.
