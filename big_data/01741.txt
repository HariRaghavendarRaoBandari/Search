ABSTRACT

With the velocity vector and temperature of the pristine interstellar neutral (ISN) He re-
cently obtained with high precision from a coordinated analysis summarized by McComas et al.
(2015a), we analyzed the IBEX observations of neutral He left out from this analysis. These
observations were collected during the ISN observation seasons 2010—2014 and cover the re-
gion in the Earth’s orbit where the Warm Breeze persists. We used the same simulation model
and a very similar parameter ﬁtting method to that used for the analysis of ISN He. We ap-
proximated the parent population of the Warm Breeze in front of the heliosphere with a homo-
geneous Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function and found a temperature of ∼ 9 500 K, an
inﬂow speed of 11.3 km s−1, and an inﬂow longitude and latitude in the J2000 ecliptic coordi-
nates 251.6◦, 12.0◦. The abundance of the Warm Breeze relative to the interstellar neutral He
is 5.7% and the Mach number is 1.97. The newly found inﬂow direction of the Warm Breeze,
the inﬂow directions of ISN H and ISN He, and the direction to the center of IBEX Ribbon
are almost perfectly co-planar, and this plane coincides within relatively narrow statistical un-
certainties with the plane ﬁtted only to the inﬂow directions of ISN He, ISN H, and the Warm
Breeze. This co-planarity lends support to the hypothesis that the Warm Breeze is the secondary
population of ISN He and that the center of the Ribbon coincides with the direction of the local
interstellar magnetic ﬁeld. The common plane for the direction of inﬂow of ISN gas, ISN H, the
Warm Breeze, and the local interstellar magnetic ﬁeld is given by the normal direction: ecliptic
longitude 349.7◦ ± 0.6◦ and latitude 35.7◦ ± 0.6 in the J2000 coordinates, with the correlation
coeﬃcient of 0.85.

Introduction

Observations of neutral gas by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX, McComas et al. 2009b) pro-
vide important insight into the physical state and processes operating in the interstellar matter in front of
the heliosphere. So far, IBEX has observed interstellar hydrogen, helium, oxygen, neon, and deuterium
(M¨obius et al. 2009b; Bochsler et al. 2012; Saul et al. 2012; Park et al. 2014, 2015; Rodr´ıguez Moreno et al.
2013).

Based on IBEX observations, Kubiak et al. (2014) discovered a previously unknown population of
neutral helium in the heliosphere, which they dubbed the Warm Breeze (WB). This population is most
visible in the portion of Earth’s orbit just before the region where interstellar neutral helium (ISN He) is
observed. Based on analysis of data collected by IBEX over a single season of ISN gas observations, they
reported that the source of WB can be reasonably approximated by a homogeneous Maxwell-Boltzmann
population of neutral He gas in a region ∼ 150 AU in front of the heliosphere and determined the best ﬁtting
temperature TWB, inﬂow direction (ecliptic longitude λWB and latitude βWB), speed vWB, and abundance
ξWB relative to the primary ISN He within relatively broad uncertainties: λWB = 240◦ ± 10◦, βWB = 11◦ +7◦
,
−3◦
vWB = 11 ± 4 km s−1, TWB = 15 000+6000
−8000 K, and ξWB = 0.07 ± 0.03. They also pointed out that the ﬁt
quality obtained was not satisfactory as indicated by a large reduced chi square value of ∼ 4 and reported
that the signal for some IBEX spin angles depended heavily on a hypothetic threshold in the sensitivity of
the IBEX-Lo instrument to low-energy neutral He atoms.

One of the most important conclusions suggested by Kubiak et al. (2014) is that the Warm Breeze
may be the secondary population of the ISN He gas. The secondary population of heliospheric neutrals is
created in the outer heliosheath, where the originally unperturbed ﬂow of interstellar plasma is deﬂected
to ﬂow past the heliopause, which is an impenetrable obstacle for interstellar plasma ions. On the other
hand, the neutral component of ISN gas is collisionless on spatial scales comparable to the size of the
heliosphere and it is not subject to electromagnetic forces governing the plasma, so it continues its bulk
motion almost without modiﬁcations. This causes decoupling of the ionized and neutral component ﬂows.
The ionized component is compressed and heated while ﬂowing past the heliosphere, which enhances charge
exchange collisions between the perturbed plasma and pristine neutral ﬂows. As a result, some ions that
belonged to interstellar plasma become neutralized, and some atoms from the neutral component become
ionized and picked up by the plasma ﬂow. Since resonant charge exchange reactions operate practically
without momentum exchange between the collision partners, the new population of neutralized interstellar
ions inherits the local parameters of the ambient plasma, which are diﬀerent from the parameters of the
unperturbed interstellar gas, and continue ﬂowing away from their birth location, decoupled from the parent
plasma. Some of those atoms enter the heliosphere, where they are subject to gravitational acceleration and
ionization. Since the ionization losses in He atoms are relatively small (Bzowski et al. 2013), an appreciable
fraction of the secondary He atoms penetrate into the Earth’s orbit, where they are measured by IBEX.

This mechanism of creation of the heliospheric secondary neutral population has been anticipated the-
oretically for quite a while (Baranov et al. 1981; Baranov & Malama 1993). The secondary population of
ISN H has been believed to exist based on many observations carried out using various techniques (see

– 3 –

Katushkina et al. (2015) for a recent review), but – to our knowledge – has not previously been unam-
biguously resolved from the primary population. The secondary He population had been believed to be of
negligible abundance (M¨uller & Zank 2004) because the reaction assumed to be responsible for its creation:
He+ + H → He + H+ has a very low cross section (Barnett et al. 1990), in contrast to similar interactions
with oxygen ions. However, Bzowski et al. (2012) pointed out that the cross section for the charge exchange
reaction between neutral He atoms and He+ ions is comparable to the large cross section for the charge
exchange between H atoms and protons, and because of the relatively high abundance of He+ ions in the
interstellar gas near the heliosphere (Frisch & Slavin 2003) appreciable amounts of the secondary He atoms
should be produced in the outer heliosheath.

If the Warm Breeze is indeed the secondary population of ISN He, then it provides information about
the physical state of interstellar matter in the outer heliosheath because it can be clearly separated from
the primary population. Based on analysis of the secondary population one can infer the temperature, ﬂow
speed, and the deﬂection angle of the ﬂow direction of the secondary component due to the deformation
of the heliosphere from axial symmetry by the action of the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld (ISMF). It was sug-
gested by Lallement et al. (2005) and found from diﬀerent heliospheric models (e.g., Izmodenov et al. 2005;
Pogorelov et al. 2008) that the secondary population of heliospheric neutrals should have a ﬂow velocity
vector in the plane formed by the inﬂow direction of the unperturbed interstellar matter and the unperturbed
vector of ISMF. Thus, if we are able to determine the inﬂow direction of the secondary component of the
ISN gas, then, with the inﬂow vector of the unperturbed interstellar gas available (Witte 2004; Bzowski et al.
2014, 2015; Leonard et al. 2015; McComas et al. 2015b,a; Schwadron et al. 2015a; Wood et al. 2015), we
can also determine the plane in which the ISMF vector is expected to be. Constraining the ISMF vec-
tor reduces the number of unknown parameters which hamper heliospheric studies using large simula-
tion codes, like the Moscow Monte Carlo model (Izmodenov & Alexashov 2015), the Huntsville model
(Pogorelov et al. 2009), or the University Michigan/Boston University model (Opher et al. 2006).

If, on the other hand, the Warm Breeze is not the secondary population of ISN He, then an even more
compelling question appears: what is its nature and origin. Answering these questions is only possible by a
more thorough analysis of the available data, which is the topic of this article. We analyze the Warm Breeze
observations carried out by IBEX out during the ISN observation seasons from 2010 through 2014 and
derive its temperature, abundance, and inﬂow velocity vector. Based on those parameters and their relation
to other heliospheric observables, we discuss possible sources for this population.

2. Observations and data selection

The strategy of ISN observations by IBEX has been presented by M¨obius et al. (2009a); M¨obius et al.
(2012), and M¨obius et al. (2015b). The details the most relevant for the present analysis are discussed in
Section 2 in Swaczyna et al. (2015); here we only point out the most important aspects.

IBEX is a sun-pointing spinning spacecraft (McComas et al. 2009b) on a highly elongated elliptical
orbit around the Earth (McComas et al. 2011), and the IBEX-Lo time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer, used for

for the analysis. The format of the ﬁgure is similar to that of Figure 1 in Bzowski et al. (2015). The gray
regions mark the individual good times intervals. The orange bars mark the beginning and the purple bars the
end of the High-Altitude Science Operations (HASO) intervals, when the IBEX measurements were actually
carried out. The thick black labels mark individual orbits (or orbital arcs, in the 2012—2014 seasons). The
red numbers (in the middle row) mark the fraction of HASO intervals occupied by the good time intervals
for a given orbit. In the lower row, the approximate longitudes of the spacecraft during a given orbit are
marked (actually, it is the Earth longitude averaged over the ISN good times for an orbit). They can be used
to identify an approximate correspondence between orbits from diﬀerent seasons. The lower horizontal axes
are scaled in the Earth’s ecliptic longitude and the upper horizontal axes are scaled in days of the calendar
year (note that new year begins during each individual Warm Breeze observation season.)

– 5 –

the ISN atom observations (Fuselier et al. 2009), scans a great circle on the sky perpendicular to the spin
axis. The instrument has eight logarithmically spaced energy channels of wide acceptance (∆E/E ≃ 0.7),
which are sequentially switched during operation. ISN atoms are observed over a few month interval around
the beginning of each calendar year, when the spacecraft together with the Earth move toward the ISN ﬂow,
thus increasing the relative speed (and energy) of the atoms and consequently their ﬂux and the eﬃciency of
their detection. As a result of this observation geometry, the relative energy of neutral He atoms varies during
the observation season and also as a function of the spacecraft spin angle. Neutral atoms enter the instrument
through a collimator and hit a specially prepared carbon conversion surface, which retains a very thin layer
of absorbed material which is mostly water. Some of the species measured by IBEX-Lo can be identiﬁed
directly because on hitting the conversion surface they form negative ions, which are then extracted by an
electric ﬁeld, accelerated, and analyzed by the electrostatic analyzer. Noble gases like He and Ne, however,
do not form stable negative ions and therefore can be observed only indirectly. When these neutrals hit the
conversion surface, they sputter a cloud of negative C, O, and H ions Wurz et al. (2008), which are collected
by the electrostatic analyzer and registered by the time-of-ﬂight spectrometer. Species identiﬁcation is
carried out on ground, by analysis of the proportions between the time-of-ﬂight signals of the sputtered C,
H, and O atoms. Details of the measurement process and data ﬂow are presented by M¨obius et al. (2015b,a),
and details of the species identiﬁcation by Park et al. (2014, 2015). The sputtering products have energies
lower than the energy of the incident atom. The energy spectrum of the sputtering products is relatively ﬂat
between 0 eV and a drop oﬀ at an energy a little lower than the energy of the incoming neutral atom. In
addition, there is a ﬁnite minimum energy for an incoming atom to sputter, which we refer to as the energy
threshold for sputtering. Therefore, the sputtering products are registered in all energy channels between
the lowest channel and the channel with the energy acceptance corresponding to the energy of the incoming
atom. The most abundant species among the sputtering products of He is hydrogen. H ions sputtered by He
are observed mostly in IBEX-Lo energy channels 1 through 3. Without further analysis of the proportions
of the H− signal to the signal from the simultaneously registered C− and O− ions, the H− ions sputtered by
incident He atoms are indistinguishable from those produced by the incoming H atoms.

The Warm Breeze is most visible from mid-November to the end of January each year. In this portion
of the Earth’s orbit, the Warm Breeze signal observed by IBEX is relatively little aﬀected by the primary
population of ISN He (Kubiak et al. 2014; Sok´oł et al. 2015b), and its signal is only slightly modiﬁed by
the magnetospheric foreground, if data selection is carried out carefully (Galli et al. 2014; Galli et al. 2015).
In the present analysis, we used observations from this portion of the Earth’s orbit. To maintain as much
year-to-year repeatability of the observation conditions as possible, we adopted a common criterion for the
orbit selection: we chose the IBEX orbits with the spin axis pointing within the range of ecliptic longitudes
(235◦, 295◦), i.e., from mid-November of the year preceding the given season year to the end of January.
This choice eﬀectively included all orbits where the Warm Breeze signal is clearly visible and by design it
ends at the beginning of the range chosen by Bzowski et al. (2015) for the analysis of the primary ISN He.
The data used were collected during the IBEX ISN gas observation campaigns from 2010—2014, because
the commissioning of the spacecraft during the 2009 IBEX ISN season was completed too late to observe the
Breeze. We use the Histogram-Binned data product, corrected where needed for the instrument throughput
reduction (M¨obius et al. 2015b; Swaczyna et al. 2015), and take the Golden Triples events, i.e., we only take

– 6 –

those events with three time-of-ﬂight measurements that are almost certainly due to H− ions. The data are
binned into 60 equal-width bins covering the full 360◦ range of IBEX spin angles. A connection between
the IBEX spin angles and the absolute directions in the sky for individual orbits is presented in Figure 2 in
Sok´oł et al. (2015b) (see also the transformation matrix given in Equation (22) in Sok´oł et al. (2015a), and
the spin axis orientation in Swaczyna et al. (2015).)

Selection of data from individual orbits was carried out using the same criteria as for the ISN He ob-
servations reported by Bzowski et al. (2015), Leonard et al. (2015), McComas et al. (2015b), M¨obius et al.
(2015b), Schwadron et al. (2015a), and Swaczyna et al. (2015). A summary of this coordinated analysis is
given by McComas et al. (2015a). In brief, these criteria rejected the data intervals with synchronization
issues, with known magnetospheric contamination, and with excessive signals observed in other IBEX en-
ergy channels. Details of good times selection were presented by Fuselier et al. (2014), Galli et al. (2014)
and Galli et al. (2015), as well as Leonard et al. (2015) and M¨obius et al. (2015b). The good times intervals
used in our analysis are presented in Figure 1.

The ﬁnal step in our data selection was choosing the spin angle range. The Warm Breeze signal is
visible in energy channels 1, 2, and 3, but the signals for individual energy channels diﬀer from each other
(Figure 2). These diﬀerences are most likely due to diﬀerent energy sensitivities of IBEX-Lo in diﬀerent
energy channels. On one hand, the absolute levels of the signal vary from one energy channel to another, and
on the other, the fall oﬀ in the wings of the signal seems to start at the spin angles that depend on the energy
of the incoming atom. In principle, such diﬀerences are expected, as shown by modeling by Kubiak et al.
(2014) and Sok´oł et al. (2015b) and observed in the measurements by Galli et al. (2015). The signal falls
oﬀ for those spin angles where atoms with lower energies enter the instrument, but for each orbit there is
an interval of spin angles where the ﬂux does not depend on the adopted energy threshold regardless of the
magnitude of the latter within all reasonably expected values.

A potentially important diﬀerence between our simulations and the actual measurement process is that
while the simulation calculates the ﬂux of neutral He atoms hitting the instrument and its collimation by the
IBEX-Lo collimator (Sok´oł et al. 2015a), it does does not emulate any processes related to the conversion
of the He atom ﬂux into the count rate of the H− ions that IBEX-Lo registers other than a sharp cutoﬀ at the
lower end of the energy spectrum of the incoming atoms. The He atoms hitting the instrument predominantly
have kinetic energies much larger than the boundaries of the three lowest energy channels of IBEX-Lo, and
the sputtered H− ions are expected to have a roughly ﬂat energy spectrum in the energy range corresponding
to the energy ranges of at least IBEX energy channel 1 and 2 (see Figure 1 in M¨obius et al. (2012) and
Saul et al. (2012)). Therefore it is expected that even though the absolute magnitudes of the count rates
measured in channels 1 and 2 may systematically diﬀer, the shapes of the signal as a function of spin angle
should be very similar. Departures may suggest that some of the signal is not due to sputtering by He
atoms (e.g., a local foreground) or that the spectrum of the sputtering products is not ﬂat, e.g., because of
a ﬁnite energy threshold for the sputtering. Therefore we chose the spin angle range where the count rates
in energy channels 1 and 2 tracked each other well (i.e., we rejected the parts where the signal started to
precipitously fall oﬀ, as expected for a ﬁnite energy threshold, see Figures 8 and 9 in Kubiak et al. (2014),
and Figure 10 in Sok´oł et al. (2015b)). Another consideration was ﬁnding a common spin angle range for all

Fig. 2.— Count rates observed in four orbits from the Warm Breeze observation season 2010 as a function
of spin angle. Unlike in Figure 4, no background and ISN He subtraction has been done. Each dot represents
the good-times averaged count rate for an individual 6-degree pixel. The colors symbolize diﬀerent IBEX-
Lo energy steps: red – channel 1, green – channel 2 (used in the ﬁtting), blue – channel 3. The vertical
bars mark the interval of spin angles selected for the baseline ﬁtting. The interval shown is from spin angle
180◦ to 354◦, i.e., the wider interval used in the complementary ﬁt (see text). The four orbits are chosen as
illustrative examples out of the eight orbits from this observation season used in the analysis. Note that the
count rate variations with the spin angle for energy channels 1 and 2 are similar to each other while energy
channel 3 features clear deviations from the other two channels. The behavior of the data from the other
observation seasons is similar.

– 8 –

orbits included in this study. This was important because on one hand we suspect the data may still contain
some remnant foreground, and on the other hand the width of the signal in the spin angle space narrows
towards later orbits. Maintaining identical numbers of data points for all orbits guarantees that no orbit is
statistically biasing the results because of the number dominance of data points it contributes to the global
sample. These considerations resulted in adoption of data from energy channel 2 from the spin angle range
from 216◦ to 318◦, i.e., 18 data points per orbit. The data selected are shown in the upper panes of the panels
in Figures 4.

In principle, we could have chosen energy channel 1 instead of 2. However, as shown by Saul et al.
(2012), energy channel 1 in the ISN orbit range contains an appreciable contribution from ISN H, with
channel 2 aﬀected much less (see also Schwadron et al. 2013; Katushkina et al. 2015). This component is
not expected in the orbits from the Warm Breeze range (however, see the Discussion later in the text), but
to infer the abundance of the Warm Breeze we must use the scaling factors between the simulated ﬂux and
the measured count rate, obtained for ISN He for each observation season. These factors were found in the
ﬁtting of the ISN He parameters by Bzowski et al. (2015), who used data from energy channel 2.

To test the robustness of our results, we also used data from an extended and narrowed spin angle
ranges: 204◦—330◦ and 228◦—306◦, respectively, and additionally, the spin angle range covering the entire
ram hemisphere: 180◦—354◦. In the two extended ranges, we do expect some dependence of the signal on
the sputtering threshold and therefore throughout the simulations we adopted a value for this threshold equal
to 38 eV, consistent with the results of the analysis by Galli et al. (2015).

3. Analysis

In this section we present the analysis process. We start with a presentation of the physical model
for the Warm Breeze phenomenon we adopted, the preparation of the data selected in the previous section
for parameter ﬁtting, and the aspects of the measurement process that aﬀect the data measurement uncer-
tainty and correlations between individual data points. Then we discuss the method of parameter ﬁtting
and assessing their uncertainties, with the correlations between the parameters presented. We also discuss
the residuals and their implications. Finally, we present additional tests of the robustness of the results and
derive the uncertainties and correlations of the Warm Breeze parameters.

3.1. The physical model, uncertainty system, and data preparation

The analysis was carried out using the method, data uncertainties, and data correlation system presented
in detail by Swaczyna et al. (2015) These aspects of the analysis are similar to those in the determination
of the inﬂow parameters of the primary ISN He population by Bzowski et al. (2015). All of the data used
had been corrected for the throughput reduction in the instrument interface, following the scheme presented
in detail by Swaczyna et al. (2015), except for the data from the 2013 and 2014 seasons, for which the
correction is not needed owing to an on-board software change. The magnitudes of the correction and their

– 9 –

uncertainties were calculated based on the actually measured data1.

The uncertainty system used in the calculation of the data covariance matrix includes the statistical un-
certainty of the Poisson counting process (uncorrelated between the data points), the background (assumed
to be constant for all data points and thus correlating them), the uncertainty of the spin axis (which correlates
points from individual orbits), the uncertainty of the IBEX-Lo boresight orientation with respect to the spin
axis (identical for all orbits, it correlates all data points), and the uncertainty of the throughput correction.
The closing element of the uncertainty system is the uncertainty of the primary ISN He model, which was
adopted as obtained from the analysis of ISN He by Bzowski et al. (2015). Before ﬁtting, we subtracted the
simulated signal from the ISN He primary population from the data. Also subtracted was the constant level
of the ubiquitous background, adopted after Galli et al. (2014) at (8.9± 1.0)· 10−3 cts s−1 for the observation
seasons 2010—2012 and to (4.2 ± 0.5) · 10−3 for the 2013 and 2014 seasons, i.e., after the PAC voltage
reduction (M¨obius et al. 2015a), identically as was done by Bzowski et al. (2015). The ISN He signal was
calculated precisely for the actual observation conditions and using the yearly scaling factors that were ﬁtted
by Bzowski et al. (2015) together with the ISN He inﬂow parameters. This was needed to exactly reproduce
the observed count rates.

The ISN He signal subtracted from the data and the signal from the Warm Breeze were simulated using
the latest version of the Warsaw Test Particle Model, presented in detail by Sok´oł et al. (2015a) with the time-
dependent photoionization rate from Sok´oł & Bzowski (2014). The physical model of the neutral He gas
observed by IBEX is a superposition of a neutral He ﬂux at the Earth’s orbit originating from two Maxwell-
Boltzmann populations of neutral He atoms in front of the heliosphere: the primary ISN He population, with
the temperature and inﬂow velocity vector in the source region as reported by Bzowski et al. (2015) for the
ﬁt to the ISN He data from all seasons (λISN = 255.75◦, βISN = 5.16◦, vISN = 25.76 km s−1, TISN = 7440 K),
and another Maxwell-Boltzmann population, corresponding to the Warm Breeze, with the parameters being
sought. These latter parameters include a temperature TWB, a velocity vector (vWB, λWB, βWB), and an
abundance ξWB relative to the primary ISN He population. In the actual ﬁtting, the temperature was replaced
with the mean square of the thermal velocity, deﬁned as vT,WB = √3kBTWB/mHe. The parameters of both
populations were assumed to be homogeneous in the source region in front of the heliosphere, and the
distance to the source (i.e., the distance of tracking the test atoms in the model) was set to 150 AU from the
Sun. Discussion of the reasons for this choice of the source distance and of its very small inﬂuence on the
results for the ISN He gas can be found in McComas et al. (2015a) and Sok´oł et al. (2015a). The relatively
small tracking distance for the Warm Breeze population, which places the source region just beyond the
heliopause, is especially reasonable for the hypothesis that the Warm Breeze is the secondary component
of ISN gas that would be formed at roughly such a distance, but the parameter values we have obtained are
very little sensitive to this choice. We assumed that the velocity vector and temperature of the Warm Breeze
in the source region do not change with time, but – because some measurement aspects varied between the

1For some ISN orbits in the 2011 and 2012 seasons, the precise value of the correction could not be calculated due to a special
observation mode of the instrument, as explained by M¨obius et al. (2015a), and an average value was used instead, but for the data
used here in the Warm Breeze parameter ﬁtting, no such approximate measures had been needed.

– 10 –

observation seasons, as explained in detail by Bzowski et al. (2015) – we allowed the abundance parameter
to vary from year to year, i.e., we adopted ﬁve free abundance parameters, used for the ﬁve yearly data
subsets. Hence the total number of ﬁt parameters was equal to 9. The abundance parameters were ﬁtted
analytically, as described by Sok´oł et al. (2015a), and were not part of the parameter grid discussed below.

3.2. Parameter ﬁtting

The Warm Breeze parameter ﬁtting was carried out in a two-step process. In the ﬁrst step, we used a
simpliﬁed ﬁtting to approximately determine the parameter correlation line for the solution. This was done
using a method similar to the method employed by Kubiak et al. (2014) in the Warm Breeze discovery paper.
In this method, a simpliﬁed uncertainty system was used, including only the statistical uncertainty of the
signal and the uncertainty of the background. The ﬁts were carried out to the data with the background and
the model of the ISN He population subtracted. They were performed for two spin angle ranges: 222◦—312◦
and 186◦—354◦.

Subsequently, with the approximate parameter correlation lines established and an approximate best-
ﬁt solution found, we deﬁned a regular grid of parameters in the four-dimensional (4D) parameter space
to carry out the calculations needed to obtain the data correlation matrix, as described by Swaczyna et al.
(2015). Based on the simpliﬁed ﬁtting, we selected the range of ecliptic longitudes between 237◦ and 259◦
with a step ∆λ = 2◦. For the remaining parameters, we decided to adopt the following steps of the grid:
∆β = 0.5◦, ∆vT = 0.5 km s−1and ∆v = 0.5 km s−1, and for each ecliptic longitude of the original grid we
selected a point (β0, vT0, v0) that was nearest to the minimum χ2 for this longitude and had coordinates being
integer multiples of the planned step of the grid. The grid nodes were constructed so that for each longitude,
we found points (β0 + nβ ∆β, vT0 + nvT ∆vT, v0 + nv ∆nv) such that for integer values of nβ, nvT, nv the condition

vT + n2
v < 4.5 was fulﬁlled. Thus we end up with a total of 4668 grid nodes around the expected
correlation line.

With the parameter grid deﬁned, we carried out simulations of the Warm Breeze ﬂux observed by IBEX
with the parameters from the grid nodes. The simulations were carried out for the entire range of spin angles
from the upwind hemisphere, so that we were able to select the spin angle range for the parameter ﬁtting
relatively easily. Then, for a selected spin angle range, we compared the simulations with the data using
the data covariance matrix and found the best-ﬁt parameters with their covariance matrix as proposed by
Swaczyna et al. (2015). Based on this, we calculated the parameter uncertainties and correlations. In addi-
tion to the baseline ﬁt, we performed additional test ﬁts for the full ram hemisphere and for two additional
spin angle ranges, one narrower by four data points per orbit, and another one for a spin angle range wider
by four data points. This was done to test the robustness of the results. Results of the ﬁtting are listed in
Table 1.

3.3. Results and discussion

Fitting the parameters brought the best-ﬁt solution λWB = 251.573◦, βWB = 11.954◦, vWB = 11.284 km s−1,
vT,WB = 7.659 km s−1. The temperature is thus TWB = 9475 K and the Mach number of the ﬂow MWB =
1.97. The abundances obtained for individual seasons were (5.72 ± 0.29, 6.00 ± 0.30, 5.79 ± 0.29, 5.63 ±
0.30, 5.21 ± 0.28) · 10−2. The resulting abundance, calculated as a weighted arithmetic mean value of
the abundances obtained for individual seasons, is ξWB = 5.66 · 10−2. The parameters form a “tube” in
parameter space, similarly as it was found in the case of IBEX observations of the ISN He population. The
covariance matrix of the solution is the following:

and illustrated in Figure 3. The strongest correlation, 0.935, exists between the inﬂow speed and thermal
velocity. The weakest correlation is for the parameter pairs including the inﬂow latitude (see the second
row in the correlation matrix). The inﬂow longitude is relatively strongly anticorrelated with the thermal
velocity, and also with the inﬂow speed due to the strong correlation of the latter with the inﬂow speed. A
similar pattern of correlations was observed by Bzowski et al. (2015) for ISN He. Projections of the 4D
correlation line and of the grid points on 2D subspaces are presented in Figure 3. The content and format of
this ﬁgure is very similar to the format of Figure 5 for the primary ISN He ﬂow in Bzowski et al. (2015).

The minimum chi square value obtained from the ﬁtting is equal to χ2

min = 1821.80 for the number of
degrees of freedom Ndof = 963, which suggests that the ﬁt quality is unsatisfactory because the minimum chi
square obtained is much greater than the statistically expected value, equal to Ndof ± √2Ndof = 963 ± 43.9.

As discussed by Swaczyna et al. (2015), a situation where the minimum chi square signiﬁcantly exceeds
the statistically expected value is not unusual in physics and astrophysics. The possible reasons include
underestimated data uncertainties, inadequate/incomplete interpretation model, or an additional signal in
the data not accounted for in the analysis. Such a situation was also encountered by Bzowski et al. (2015),
who decided to adopt a procedure of scaling up the uncertainties by multiplying them by the square root
of reduced chi square, i.e., by qχ2
min/Ndof. This uncertainty scaling was suggested, among others, by
Olive et al. (2014). In our case, χ2
min/Ndof ≃ 1.9, so the uncertainties should be multiplied by a factor of
∼ 1.4. We perform this scaling again here and list the results as the parameter uncertainties in Table 1, but

we refrain from adopting these uncertainties as the ﬁnal for our parameters because of the reasons explained
later in this section.

Similarly as for the primary ISN population (Bzowski et al. 2012; Bzowski et al. 2015; McComas et al.
2012), the correlation between the parameters results in a very elongated, deep minimum of chi square in
parameter space. The blue lines in Figure 3 illustrate the isocontours for the chi square value equal to
χ2
min + 6.2 · 1.9, corresponding to the region of a 2σ uncertainty, scaled by the minimum reduced chi square
value to acknowledge the uncertainty scaling descibed previously. All chi square values outside the regions
marked by the blue contours in Figure 3 are larger.

The direct cause of the high value of minimum chi square can be inferred from inspection of Fig-
ure 4. While the best-ﬁt model generally reproduces the observed signal quite well, two intervals of ecliptic
longitudes can be identiﬁed where the best-ﬁt solution systematically deviates from the data. The most
conspicuous of them begins at λ ≃ 95◦ (orbit 59 and the equivalent ones from the subsequent seasons, cf.
also Figure 1). Approximately six data points near the center of the spin angle range in those orbits show
an excess of the data over the model, which systematically increases with the increasing Earth longitude,
even though the normalized residuals do not look that bad in this region because of the large uncertainties
of the data there. The remaining data points from these orbits do not show any systematic deviations. While
the statistics in this interval is the best during an individual observation season (relatively large count num-
bers registered), the uncertainty is large because the signal in this region has a large contribution from the
primary ISN He population, which is practically absent in the data collected in the earlier portion of the
Earth’s orbit. An application of the uncertainty system from Swaczyna et al. (2015) results in the relatively
large uncertainties in the count rate left for ﬁtting the Warm Breeze after subtraction of the primary ISN He
model.

Another region where the residuals are relatively large is the Earth longitude range below ∼ 75◦ (orbits
56 and the earlier ones, as well as their equivalents in the following seasons). In this region, the residuals are
also predominantly positive, especially in the 2010—2012 seasons, but the statistics of the observed atoms
is the lowest in the sample. This excess of the signal over the model can be understood based on analysis by
Galli et al. (2014), who suggested that remnants of the magnetospheric foreground may persist in this region,
despite all the ﬁltering procedures applied. An argument in favor of this hypothesis may be a reduction of
this phenomenon in the data from 2013 and 2014, i.e., after the reduction of the post-acceleration voltage
(M¨obius et al. 2015b)2. The magnetospheric contamination is believed to be mostly due to H atoms (the
dominant ENAs emitted by the magnetosphere), and their energy seems to mostly be in energy channels
1 and 2. The helium atoms from the Warm Breeze are more energetic. The reduction in the PAC voltage
resulted in a decrease in the sensitivity of IBEX-Lo, and the reduction seems to be stronger for the atoms
with lower energies. Hence a likely hypothesis to explain the residuals behavior is the disappearance of the
magnetospheric foreground in the data because the instrument became less sensitive to this component.

2Note that the vertical scales in the upper and middle panes of the yearly panels in Figure 4 are adjusted to follow the actual

amplitude of the signal, which is reduced in 2013 and 2014.

for the spin angle range 216◦—318◦. Note that none of the data points from the 2009 season were used
for ﬁtting the Warm Breeze parameters. The spin angle range used by Bzowski et al. (2015) for the ISN
He analysis is 252◦—282◦, which corresponds to the center six points for orbits 14 through 19 and their
equivalents from the later seasons. The data points are arranged in the increasing order of their respective
spin angles, the subsets corresponding to individual orbits are partitioned by the vertical bars. The vertical
axis is scaled in counts per second. The cyan line represents the model of the primary ISN He, the green
line the model of the Warm Breeze, and the red line corresponds to the sum of the latter two components.
The blue symbols represent the measured count rates (with the constant background subtracted) and their
uncertainties. The lower panel presents the ratio of the ﬂux due to the Warm Breeze to the ﬂux due to ISN
He for the 2011 season. For the other seasons, details of this ratio are diﬀerent, but the general behavior

Fig. 6.— Comparison of the data and the full model including the primary ISN He and the Warm Breeze,
for the orbits from the 2012—2014 ISN observation seasons used by Bzowski et al. (2015) to ﬁt the ISN
He parameters (orbit # ≥ 153b, ≥ 193a, and ≥ 233b for the three seasons, respectively) and for the orbits
used now in the Warm Breeze ﬁtting, for the spin angle range 216◦—318◦. The color and symbol code is
identical to that in Figure 5. Note the consistently lower levels of the signal in 2013 and 2014 because of the
reduction in the PAC voltage introduced after the 2012 ISN season.

– 17 –

Another hypothesis, which is complementary to the former one, is that the residual is due to ISN H.
Saul et al. (2012) and Schwadron et al. (2013) pointed out that the core of the ISN H contribution to the
signal observed in the lowest energy channels of IBEX-Lo is observed in orbit 23 and the corresponding
ones during the solar minimum epoch, and that this signal fades during the epoch of high solar activity
due to an increased level of the repulsive solar radiation pressure. However, an analysis by Kubiak et al.
(2013) suggests that a non-zero ﬂux from ISN H (calculated as a superposition of the primary and secondary
populations) is expected throughout the entire ISN observation season (see their Figure 3) and that maximum
intensity of this signal for orbits 55 through 58 should be only a little lower than that of the primary ISN He.
The ISN H ﬂux for these orbits is expected to be at a level of a few times 10−4 of the signal expected for ISN
He at the seasonal peak intensity, i.e., at a level comparable to the level of the signal from ISN He. The latter
one for these orbits, as seen in the lower panel of Figure 5, is at a level of 0.01 of the Warm Breeze signal.
This makes the hypothetical contribution from the ISN H to the residuals of our present model of the Warm
Breeze of a similar order of magnitude to what we actually observe. Furthermore, Kubiak et al. (2013)
predict an appreciable reduction of the ISN H ﬂux during the times of high solar activity, and indeed, the
residuals that we obtained for the seasons of high solar activity are lower for this portion of the Earth’s orbit.
This topic certainly deserves further studies, because, on one hand, calculations by Kubiak et al. (2013)
were carried out with the assumptions similar to those made by Katushkina et al. (2015), and on the other
hand, Katushkina et al. (2015) showed, using a very sophisticated model of ISN H, that these assumptions
lead to a simulated signal very diﬀerent from the signal actually observed for the orbit where the ISN H ﬂux
maximum is expected. To narrow this gap, these authors had to signiﬁcantly modify the radiation pressure
used in the simulations. The consequences of this modiﬁcation for the ISN H ﬂux expected on the orbits
we discuss now, i.e., 54—57 and the equivalent from the other seasons are unknown. However, further
investigation of this aspect is beyond the scope of our paper.

Following the same argument, the excess of the data above the simulation at the large longitude at the
end of the data set is likely due to the primary ISN He atoms. In this case, despite the reduction of the PAC
voltage and the increased level of solar activity, the excess has not disappeared, so very likely this excess
is due to He atoms, not H atoms. A non-perfect reproduction of the ISN He population in our analysis
can, in fact, be expected based on the insight provided by Bzowski et al. (2015). They pointed out that the
parameters of the ISN He model they had obtained may be biased due to an imprecise knowledge of the
Warm Breeze parameters. These parameters were imprecise, as was suggested by these authors, and as can
be seen from our present analysis. On the other hand, statistically speaking, the only evidence for this excess
is the visible correlation between the positive absolute residuals for the Earth longitudes larger than ∼ 90◦,
since the magnitude of the normalized residuals is not signiﬁcantly larger than in the remaining portion of
the data.

The agreement between the data and the model of the neutral He signal is good even for the orbits that
were not used in the Warm Breeze ﬁtting. This is illustrated in Figures 5 and 6. Even though the ISN He
model was ﬁtted only to the six center points for each of the orbits used by Bzowski et al. (2015), and the
Warm Breeze ﬁtting did not use the data from these orbits at all, the agreement between the data and the
sum of the ISN He and Warm Breeze populations is evident and most of the small deviations seem to be

– 18 –

random. They typically occur at the boundaries of the spin angle range, where a contribution from the local
foreground may still be present. Inspection of the lower panel of Figure 5, which shows the ratio of the
Warm Breeze ﬂux to the ISN He ﬂux, reveals the balance between the two populations in diﬀerent orbits
and diﬀerent spin angles, and conﬁrms the choice of data by M¨obius et al. (2015a), Leonard et al. (2015),
Swaczyna et al. (2015), Schwadron et al. (2015a), and Bzowski et al. (2015) for their analyses of the primary
ISN He ﬂow: the data they used contain relatively little contribution from the Warm Breeze. Simultaneously,
it can be seen that a small remnant contribution was still present, as suspected by Bzowski et al. (2015) and
M¨obius et al. (2015a).

A more fundamental reason of the high value of the chi square minimum may be a weakness of the
adopted model for the parent population. We approximate this population with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distri-
bution function with spatially homogenous parameters. But if the Warm Breeze is the secondary population
of ISN He, created in the outer heliosheath, then this approximation is certainly not perfect and we expect
signiﬁcant spatial gradients in the ﬂow speed, direction, and temperature of the parent gas. Therefore the
parameters we derive in our analysis must be regarded as a kind of mean values, spatially averaged over the
source region of the Warm Breeze population. We speculate that such spatial gradients of the parent plasma
parameters could be responsible for some systematic departures of the simulated signal from the data and
thus for the high value of the minimum chi square found.

To check the robustness of the solution, we reviewed the ﬁt results for the additional spin angle ranges
mentioned earlier (see Table 1). The two wider ranges included the portions of the data where the signal is
expected to depend on the non-zero energy threshold of the sensitivity of IBEX-Lo, reported by Galli et al.
(2015) to be at least ∼ 20 eV. It is evident that the ﬁt parameters react to the change in the spin angle range
adopted for the analysis. The absolute magnitude of the changes is larger than the uncertainties of the ﬁtting,
even after scaling them up. This is not surprising, since broadening the range of spin angles includes some
data points aﬀected by the uncertain sensitivity of the instrument to low-energy atoms. Relatively, the largest
changes are seen in the temperature. Not surprisingly, the reduced chi square minimum, which is a measure
of departure of the model from the data per degree of freedom, is larger when we include these additional
data and is the lowest for the case we have selected as the baseline, which supports our choice.

We conclude from this test that the formal uncertainty estimates are too optimistic even after scaling
them up to accommodate the high minimum chi square value. Therefore, in addition to the uncertainties
resulting from the scaled-up covariance matrix, we also include uncertainties related to the poorly known
drop in sensitivity for low energies. These additional uncertainties are estimated as the mean absolute values
of the diﬀerences between the result of the baseline case and the cases listed in the ﬁrst and third row in
Table 1: ∆λWB = 0.9◦, ∆βWB = 0.6◦, ∆vWB = 0.6 km s−1, ∆TWB = 1 600 K, ∆MWB = 0.05, and
∆ξWB = 0.007.

Narrowing the uncertainty of the Warm Breeze parameters will be possible after the sensitivity of
the IBEX-Lo detector to He atoms with low energies is better understood. This requires carrying out a
post-calibration on the spare version of the instrument, which is planned in the near future. With this
additional calibration, we will hopefully be able to extend the data range into the spin angle regions aﬀected

– 19 –

by the decreasing instrument sensitivity for lower-energy atoms and to use data from two or hopefully
three energy channels, which will further improve the statistics. For now, we adopt the uncertainty of the
Warm Breeze inﬂow parameters listed in row 2 in Table 1, additionally broadened by ∆λWB, ∆βWB, ∆vWB,
∆TWB, ∆MWB, and ∆ξWB, respectively: λWB = (251.57 ± 0.50 ± 0.9)◦, βWB = (11.95 ± 0.30 ± 0.6)◦, vWB =
(11.28±0.48±0.7) km s−1, ξWB = (5.7±0.4±0.7)·10−2. The temperature is TWB = (9.48±0.92±1.6)·103 K
and the Mach number MWB = 1.97 ± 0.04 ± 0.05. The correlations between the uncertainties listed as the
ﬁrst ones are described by Equation 2.

The uncertainty range obtained in the present analysis of ﬁve IBEX Warm Breeze observation seasons
marginally overlaps with the uncertainty range provided by Kubiak et al. (2014) based on their analysis of
the 2010 WB observation season alone. The most likely values obtained now diﬀer in the longitude by
∼ +11◦ and in the temperature by ∼ −5500 K, with the remaining parameters changed very little. The
reasons for these diﬀerences are most likely 1) the improved data selection we adopted here compared to
that by Kubiak et al. (2014), 2) using by those authors a much less precise version of the model of the ISN
He population than currently available (they used the ISN He parameters from Bzowski et al. (2012)), and
3) the fact that the data set used in the present study was larger by a factor of ﬁve because now we have
data from ﬁve observation seasons, not just one. Additionally, whereas Kubiak et al. (2014) used the data
from the entire observation season, including the portion where the contribution from the primary ISN He
population dominates, here we used solely the portion of the data not used by Bzowski et al. (2015) to ﬁt
the primary ISN He parameters.

Implications

Based on the insight gathered from this study, with all the uncertainties quantiﬁed, we can now propose

a ﬁrm interpretation of the Warm Breeze. This interpretation is based on two indirect pieces of evidence.

The ﬁrst of piece of evidence is the magnitude of the deﬂection of the Warm Breeze inﬂow direction
from the inﬂow of the primary ISN He inﬂow. Taking as the basis the ISN He direction obtained recently

energy, being the second and third from the top). The purple cross is the average direction for energy
channels 2—4, with error bars. The blue line is the great circle ﬁtted to the directions of the Ribbon center,
ISN He, ISN H, and the Warm Breeze (see Table 2).

by Bzowski et al. (2015), who used a very similar ﬁtting method to the method used here, we obtain the
deﬂection of the Warm Breeze from the primary ISN He equal to 7.9◦. Such a deﬂection, as well as the
temperature and inﬂow speed of the Warm Breeze, are similar to the respective quantities predicted for the
secondary ISN He by Kubiak et al. (2014) (see their Figure 11) based on simulations that were carried out
using the Moscow Monte Carlo model of the heliosphere (Izmodenov & Alexashov 2015) with interstellar
parameters assumed very close to the parameters currently considered to be the most accurate (Bzowski et al.
2015; Schwadron et al. 2015a; McComas et al. 2015a).

The other piece of evidence is the observation that the IBEX Ribbon center (Funsten et al. 2013) and
the directions of inﬂow of ISN He primary population (Bzowski et al. 2015), ISN H (i.e., a superposition of
the primary and secondary populations, Lallement et al. 2005, 2010), and of the Warm Breeze that we have
found now are coplanar.

We ﬁtted a great circle on the sky to these four directions, using the uncertainty systems from Bzowski et al.

(2015) and the present paper, the Ribbon center and its errors given by Funsten et al. (2013): (λRibbon =
219.2◦±1.3◦, βRibbon = 39.9◦±2.3◦) and the ISN H inﬂow direction and its uncertainty given by Lallement et al.
(2010): (λISNH = 252.5◦ ± 0.7◦, βISNH = 8.9◦ ± 0.5◦). The ﬁtted great circle is deﬁned by its normal direction
in the J2000 heliocentric ecliptic coordinates, equal to (λ = 349◦ ± 0.6◦, β = 35.7◦ ± 2.1◦). This circle is
plotted in Figure 7. The minimum chi square for this ﬁt is equal to 3.59, while the statistically expected
value is equal to 4.0 ± 2.8, which implies an excellent ﬁt. As can be seen in Figure 7, the great circle goes
through the uncertainty ranges of all four points used in the ﬁt. It is evident from this ﬁgure that even if
we adopted the WB inﬂow direction obtained from the ﬁts to the wider ranges of spin angles instead of the
one we have actually used, the resulting great circle would still go through the uncertainty ranges of all the
points used in the ﬁts, so the co-planarity conclusion would still hold.

The inﬂow directions of the ISN He and the Warm Breeze form the so-called Helium Deﬂection Plane
(HeDP), with the normal vector listed in the ﬁrst row of Table 2. This plane coincides within the uncertainties
with the Hydrogen Deﬂection Plane (HDP), originally suggested by Lallement et al. (2005) and listed in the
second row of Table 2 for the ISN He direction from Bzowski et al. (2015), very similar to the derivation by
Witte (2004).

As discussed in the Introduction, this planar alignment of ISN He, ISN H, and the Warm Breeze and of
the center of the Ribbon can be naturally explained if the ISMF direction is the direction to the center of the
Ribbon and — simultaneously — the Warm Breeze is the secondary population of ISN He. Then the Warm
Breeze direction is expected to be coplanar with a plane determined by the directions of the local ISMF and
the ISN He inﬂow. To test the robustness of this hypothesis against evidence given by the available data,
we calculated the normal directions to the plane ﬁtted to the ISN He inﬂow directions from Bzowski et al.
(2015) and various combinations of ISN H, Ribbon Center, and the Warm Breeze direction obtained here.
The results are collected in Table 2. They all agree with each other within their respective uncertainties,
which supports the hypothesis that the Warm Breeze is the secondary population of ISN He and the Ribbon
center coincides with the ISMF direction.

Adopting this hypothesis, we suggest that the so-called B − V plane, i.e., the plane including the ISMF

– 22 –

vector and the ﬂow vector of interstellar matter is the plane obtained from ﬁtting the directions of the Ribbon
center and inﬂow directions of ISN He, ISN H, and the Warm Breeze. The normal vector to this plane is
given by the J2000 ecliptic coordinates λBV = 349.70◦ ± 0.56◦, βBV = 35.72◦ ± 2.06◦, with the correlation
coeﬃcient equal to 0.82, as listed in the sixth row in Table 2.

The idea that the deﬂection of the secondary components of ISN neutrals from the inﬂow direction of
the unperturbed ISN gas is in the plane deﬁned by the velocity vector of the unperturbed ISN gas and the
vector of ISMF results from heliospheric models including the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld and both excluding
(e.g., Izmodenov et al. 2005) and including the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld (Pogorelov et al. 2008). The
inﬂow direction of ISN H obtained by Lallement et al. (2010) is in fact a superposition of the inﬂow direc-
tions of the primary and secondary populations of ISN H, which are expected to be of comparable densities
both in the heliospheric interface and within a few AU from the Sun (Katushkina et al. 2015), where the
signal observed by SWAN/SOHO and analyzed by Lallement et al. (2005) is formed. Thus also the ISN H
direction is expected to be coplanar with the plane determined by the Ribbon center and the ISN He inﬂow
direction.

There are essentially two proposed physical mechanisms that create a Ribbon centered on the interstel-
lar magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁrst of these concepts, proposed by McComas et al. (2009a) and ﬁrst quantiﬁed by
Heerikhuisen et al. (2010), involves the neutral solar wind (i.e., ENAs produced via charge exchange from
solar wind protons), which travels out beyond the heliopause and forms a pickup ring after ionization. The
mechanism requires that the pickup ring remains stable for long periods (months to years), allowing the
pickup ring particles to undergo charge-exchange and generate neutrals. Provided that the neutral particles
are produced along the locus where the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld is roughly perpendicular to the radial
direction (B · r ≃ 0), some of these neutrals are directed back toward the Sun and can be observed by IBEX.

Several new lines of evidence also suggest that the Ribbon center is the direction of ISMF. Schwadron et al.

(2015b) used Voyager 1 observations beyond the heliopause to show that the observed magnetic ﬁeld steadily
rotates, consistently with the undraping of the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld as Voyager 1 moves further out to-
ward the pristine interstellar magnetic ﬁeld. When the rotation is projected out into the pristine interstellar
medium, it is found that the Voyager 1 ﬁeld direction converges with the center of the IBEX Ribbon. This
draping eﬀect was further modeled by Zirnstein et al. (2015, 2016) and produces the Ribbon centers close to
those observed by IBEX. These authors (Zirnstein et al. 2016) found that the direction to the Ribbon center
as a function of energy change relatively little and remain in the B − V plane.

The second line of evidence, indicating consistency between the center of the IBEX Ribbon and ISMF,
is found from observations of TeV cosmic rays (Schwadron et al. 2014).
In this case, the streaming of
cosmic rays determined from TeV cosmic ray anisotropies appears to roughly align with the direction of
ISMF determined from the Ribbon center.

The third line of evidence that the IBEX Ribbon center is the direction of ISMF is the consistency
of this direction with the interstellar ﬁeld direction obtained from locally polarized starlight (Frisch et al.
2015). This implies that the ordering of the interstellar ﬁeld persists over much larger spatial scales than that
of the heliosphere.

5. Summary and conclusions

We have analyzed observations of neutral He atoms collected by IBEX-Lo in energy channel 2 during
the ISN observation seasons 2010—2014 to estimate the Mach number, temperature, the inﬂow direction
and speed, and the abundance of the Warm Breeze discovered by Kubiak et al. (2014). We used data col-
lected in the portion of the Earth’s orbit that had been excluded from the analysis of the ISN He parame-
ters by Bzowski et al. (2015); Leonard et al. (2015); McComas et al. (2015b,a); M¨obius et al. (2015b), and
Schwadron et al. (2015a). We assumed that the observed signal is a superposition of signals due to two
Maxwell-Boltzmann populations of neutral He in front of the heliosphere: the primary ISN He population
with the parameters known from Bzowski et al. (2015), and the Warm Breeze population with the parameters
we sought to ﬁt. We used a parameter ﬁtting method very similar to the method presented by Swaczyna et al.
(2015) and carried out simulations using the Warsaw Test Particle Model, presented by Sok´oł et al. (2015a),
with the time-dependent ionization losses based on the helium ionization history from Sok´oł & Bzowski
(2014).

We found that the Warm Breeze parameter values obtained directly from the ﬁtting procedure are
highly correlated, similarly as it was found by Bzowski et al. (2015) for the ISN He parameters, and that
the minimum chi square value signiﬁcantly exceeds the expected value. We also found that the ﬁt results
show some dependence on the data choice because for some spin angles, the observed ﬂux is sensitive to
the drop in the sensitivity of the IBEX-Lo instrument to low-energy He atoms, found by Galli et al. (2015)
and Sok´oł et al. (2015b). This additional uncertainty aﬀects mostly the inﬂow direction and temperature of
the Warm Breeze, and is larger than the formal parameter uncertainties obtained from the covariance matrix
of the ﬁt. With this additional uncertainty included, the Warm Breeze inﬂow direction in the J2000 ecliptic
coordinates is (251.57 ± 0.50 ± 0.9)◦, βWB = (11.95 ± 0.30 ± 0.6)◦, vWB = (11.28 ± 0.48 ± 0.7) km s−1.
The abundance relative to the primary ISN He is ξWB = (5.7 ± 0.4 ± 0.7) · 10−2, the temperature TWB =
(9.48± 0.92± 1.6)· 103 K and the Mach number MWB = 1.97± 0.04± 0.05, with the correlations between the
uncertainties that are listed as the ﬁrst ones described by Equation 2; the uncertainties listed as the second
entries reﬂect the uncertainty of the instrument sensitivity. The Warm Breeze parameters obtained in the
original derivation by Kubiak et al. (2014) marginally agree with the presently obtained (i.e., the error bars
overlap), but the uncertainty obtained now is much smaller.

With the new, more precise direction of the Warm Breeze and with the direction of inﬂow of ISN He
obtained by Bzowski et al. (2014, 2015); Leonard et al. (2015); McComas et al. (2015b,a); Schwadron et al.
(2015a), and Wood et al. (2015) from IBEX and Ulysses observations we ﬁnd that these directions are
coplanar, within their respective uncertainty ranges. The plane ﬁtted to these four directions is in statis-
tical agreement with a plane containing the directions of inﬂow of ISN He and the center of the IBEX
Ribbon, as well as the plane ﬁtted to the directions of ISN He, ISN H from Lallement et al. (2010), as
well as the plane ﬁtted to the directions of ISN He and WB. Thus the results obtained in this paper
for the Warm Breeze, in the papers by Lallement et al. (2005) and Lallement et al. (2010) for ISN H, by
Funsten et al. (2013) for the Ribbon center, and by Bzowski et al. (2014, 2015); Leonard et al. (2015);
McComas et al. (2015b,a); M¨obius et al. (2015a); Schwadron et al. (2015a); Wood et al. (2015); and Witte
(2004) for ISN He are consistent with the hypothesis that the Warm Breeze is the secondary compo-

– 24 –

nent of ISN He (Bzowski et al. 2012; Kubiak et al. 2014) and the hypothesis by McComas et al. (2009a),
Schwadron et al. (2009) and Heerikhuisen et al. (2010) that the direction of the local interstellar magnetic
ﬁeld coincides with the IBEX Ribbon center. This B − V plane is given by its normal direction in the J2000
ecliptic coordinates λBV = 349.70◦ ± 0.56◦, βBV = 35.72◦ ± 2.07◦, with the correlation coeﬃcient of 0.85.
