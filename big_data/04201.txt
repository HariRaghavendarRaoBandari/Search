SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF

LIMITING CARLEMAN WEIGHTS

PABLO ANGULO-ARDOY, DANIEL FARACO, AND LUIS GUIJARRO

Abstract. In [1], we found some necessary conditions for a Riemann-
ian manifold to admit a local limiting Carleman weight (LCW), based
upon the Cotton-York tensor in dimension 3 and the Weyl tensor in
dimension 4. In this paper, we ﬁnd further necessary conditions for the
existence of local LCWs that are often suﬃcient. For a manifold of di-
mension 3 or 4, we classify the possible Cotton-York, or Weyl tensors,
and provide a mechanism to ﬁnd out whether the manifold admits local
LCW for each type of tensor. In particular, we show that a product of
two surfaces admits a LCW if and only if at least one of the two surfaces
is of revolution. This provides an example of a manifold satisfying the
eigenﬂag condition of [1] but not admitting LCW .

1. Introduction

Since the 1987 foundational paper of Sylvester and Uhlmann [14] (for
more recent results see [5, 9, 10]), the only eﬀective strategy to solve the
Calder´on inverse problem, has been based on the existence of Complex Geo-
metric Optic solutions, CGO for short. In the Riemannian setting, it was
discovered in [6] that CGO solutions depend on the existence of so called
limiting Carleman weights. The existence of such functions was shown to
be a problem in conformal geometry:

Theorem 1.1 ([6, Theorem 1.2]). If (M, g) is a open manifold having a
limiting Carleman weight, then some conformal multiple of the metric g,
called ˜g ∈ [g], admits a parallel unit vector ﬁeld. For simply connected
manifolds, the converse is true.

For further developments see [3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13]. To avoid the simply
connected hypothesis, we will focus on existence of a local LCW at a point
p, which is a LCW deﬁned on some neighborhood of p.

Since this condition relates to the conformal class, the paper [1] studied
such condition in terms of the classical tensors of conformal geometry, i.e,
the Weyl and Cotton tensors (see section 2 in [1] for the basics on algebraic

curvature operators and bivectors over a real vector space V ; we will stick
to the notation from that paper). In [1] we introduced the following notion:

Deﬁnition 1.2 ([1]). Let W be a Weyl tensor in S2(Λ2V ). We say that W
satisﬁes the eigenﬂag condition if and only if there is a vector v ∈ V such
that W (v ∧ v⊥) ⊂ v ∧ v⊥.

By examining the Weyl tensor of metrics with an R-factor, we obtained

in [1] the following obstruction for the existence of LCW’s.

Theorem 1.3 ([1]). Let (M, g) be a Riemannian manifold of dimension
n > 4. Assume that a metric ˜g ∈ [g] admits a parallel vector ﬁeld. Then
In particular, for
for any p ∈ M , Wp satisﬁes the eigenﬂag condition.
any p ∈ M , Wp ∈ S2(Λ2(T ∗p M )) has at least n − 1 linearly independent
eigenvectors which are simple.

In dimension 3, the obstruction was described in terms of the Cotton-York

tensor CY .
Theorem 1.4 ([1]). Let n = 3. If a metric ˜g ∈ [g] admits a parallel vector
ﬁeld, then for any p ∈ M , there is a tangent vector v ∈ TpM such that

CYp(v, v) = CYp(w1, w2) = 0

for any pair of vectors w1, w2 ∈ v⊥.

Both theorems only gave necessary conditions for the existence of LCW’s.
The results of the current paper study whether the converse to the above
results hold. Speciﬁcally, we provide suﬃcient conditions for the existence
of limiting Carleman weights, and thus CGO solutions, and develop them
in detail in dimensions three and four.

For 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds, the results in this paper and in [1]
can answer whether the manifold admits a limiting Carleman weight, and
identify them if they exist, except for some corner cases that may require
some ad hoc work. We show in section 7 how to deal with these cases.

The proof of our results combines a more precise analysis of the algebraic
structure of the Weyl and Cotton tensor and an analysis of how distributions
in T M get aﬀected by conformal changes in the metric. With a slight abuse
of notation we deﬁne
Deﬁnition 1.5. D ⊂ T M is a conformal factor of a metric g if it is a
smooth distribution of constant rank, such that a conformal multiple of g is
a product metric with D and D⊥ tangent to the factors.

We prove that for a concrete distribution D, the behaviour of the Lie
derivatives or of the Covariant derivatives characterises conformal factors
(see our Theorem 2.4 ). Thus if for a metric (M, g) there are a ﬁnite number
of eigenﬂag conditions the combination of this result for distributions of rank
1 and theorems 1.3 and 1.4 answers the question of the existence of LCW

In this way we can analyse all three dimensional manifolds.

Theorem 1.6. Let (M, g) be a 3-dimensional manifold, and p ∈ M a given
point.

(1) If det CYp 6= 0, or there is a sequence of points pk converging to p
such that det CYpk 6= 0, there are no local LCWs at p
(2) If there is a neighborhood U of p where CY 6= 0 but det CY = 0,
then U admits a LCW if and only if one of the two one-dimensional
distributions of eigenﬂag directions for CY satisﬁes one of the equiv-
alent conditions in Theorem 2.4

(3) If there is a neighborhood U of p where CY |U ≡ 0, then the metric
is conformally ﬂat in U , and it admits the same LCWs as a subset
of R3.

The four dimensional case is contained in the following Theorem; the

deﬁnition of the types of Weyl tensors is deferred to Lemma 1.9.
Theorem 1.7. Let (M, g) be a 4-dimensional manifold and p ∈ M .

tensors of type A converging to p, there are not local LCWs at p.

• If W is of type A at p, or there is a sequence of points with Weyl
• If W is of type B at all points in a neighborhood of p, then M admits
a local LCW at p if and only if at least one of the four 1-dimensional
distributions deﬁned by eigenﬂags as in Lemma 1.9 satisﬁes the hy-
pothesis of Theorem 2.4.

• If W is of type C at all points in a neighborhood of p, and the two
complementary distributions of eigenﬂag directions satisfy the hy-
pothesis of Theorem 2.4, then M is locally conformal to a product of
surfaces, and it admits a local LCW if and only if at least one of the
two integral factors is a surface of revolution.

• If W is of type D at all points in a neighborhood of p, then it is
locally conformally ﬂat at p, and admits the same LCWs as a subset
of R4.

To write a concrete example of a manifold with an eigenﬂag vector ﬁeld,
but without any local LCW (showing that the necessary condition from
theorem 1.3 is not suﬃcient) recall that an ellipsoid in R3 is scalene if its
three axis have diﬀerent lengths.
Theorem 1.8. Let (M, g) = (S1, g1) × (S2, g2) where S1 and S2 are two
scalene ellipsoids with the metric induced by R3. Then any open subset of
(M, g) satisﬁes the eigenﬂag condition but does not admit any LCW.

The paper starts in Section 2 by considering a metric that becomes a
product after a conformal change. The 3-dimensional case is examined in
Section 3. Here Theorem 1.4 says that there are only a ﬁnite number of di-
rections than can be factors of a product after conformal change; we analyze
them by means of Theorem 2.4. This will provide a proof of Theorem 1.6.
Section 4 classiﬁes the possible algebraic Weyl tensors that may arise in a
4-dimensional manifold in terms of its eigenﬂag directions and eigenspaces.
This allows us to identify all the eigenﬂag directions.

Lemma 1.9. The algebraic Weyl operators W in a vector space of dimen-
sion 4 fall into one of the following types:
A: W has no eigenﬂag directions.
B: W has at least one eigenﬂag direction and three diﬀerent eigenspaces of
dimension 2. In this case, W has exactly four eigenﬂag directions.
C: W has at least one eigenﬂag direction and two eigenspaces with dimen-
In this case, the eigenﬂag directions for W

sions four and two.
consist of the union of two orthogonal 2-planes.

D: W is null. All directions are eigenﬂag.

We use this information in Section 5; as explained above, Theorem 2.4
suﬃces to deal with case B. In Section 6, we give an interesting example
where three of the four eigenﬂag directions are conformal factors. This is a
manifold with three LCWs with orthogonal level sets, that is not conformal
to a product of surfaces.

We start Section 5 by proving that product metrics of surfaces have Weyl
operators of Types C and D; then we show that if such a product of surfaces
admits a LCW and its Weyl operator is of type C (not the trivial conformally
ﬂat case), we can choose coordinates where the metric assumes a specially
nice form. As a result, we are able to prove

Theorem 1.10. Let (S1, g1) and (S2, g2) be open subsets of R2 with Rie-
mannian metrics. Assume that the Weyl operator of the product metric does
not vanish at any point. The following are equivalent:

• (S1, g1) is locally isometric to a surface of revolution
• (S1, g1) has a non-trivial Killing vector ﬁeld
• (S1 × S2, g1 × g2) admits a LCW that is everywhere tangent to the

ﬁrst factor

Hence Theorem 1.8 is a corollary of this, as scalene ellipsoids are not
surfaces of revolution and their product satisfy the condition on the Weyl
operator.

We are left with the case where a manifold may have a Weyl tensor of type
C, but not be conformal to a product of surfaces. Therefore in principle there
are many candidates to be one dimensional conformal factors. In section 7,
we show that this is indeed possible, and show to deal with this situation in
an speciﬁc example and explain how to proceed in general.

Finally, we would like to point out that, in principle, a similar analysis
might be conducted in higher dimensions though satisfying the eigenﬂag
condition is more rare (see [1, Theorem 6.1] for a quantitative statement in
this regard), and the analysis is bound to become much more complicated.

2. Criteria for a conformal product

Suppose we are given a Riemannian manifold (M, g) with a vector dis-
tribution D ⊂ T M such that both D and its orthogonal complement D⊥
are integrable. The main result of this section establishes criteria that will

SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF LCWS

5

assure that M is locally conformal to a product metric with D and D⊥
tangent to the factors. In order to state them, we will need some notation.

The orthogonal splitting T M = D ⊕ D⊥ induces bundle projections

PD : T M → D, PD⊥ : T M → D⊥;

we will alternatively denote by X D and X⊥ to the components of a vector
ﬁeld under the above splitting.

Given a metric tensor g in M , we denote by gD and g⊥ the restrictions

of g to D and D⊥ respectively, that is

gD(X, Y ) := g(PD(X), PD(y)),

g⊥(X, Y ) := g(PD⊥(X), PD⊥ (y)).

It is clear that

g(X, Y ) = gD(X, Y ) + g⊥(X, Y ).

for any pair of vector ﬁelds X, Y .

Lemma 2.1. Assume D, D⊥ are integrable distributions of dimensions d
and n − d respectively. Then for any point p ∈ M , there is a coordinate
chart (U, φ) with φ = (x1, . . . , xn) such that

(1) φ(p) = 0, φ(U ) = (−1, 1)n;
(2) the integral manifolds for D in U are given by equations

(xd+1, . . . , xn) = (ad+1, . . . , an);

(3) the integral manifolds for D⊥ in U are given by equations

(x1, . . . , xd) = (a1, . . . , ad).

Proof. Frobenius theorem gives us charts (U1, φ1) and (U2, φ2), with φ1 =
(y1, . . . , yn), φ2 = (z1, . . . , zn), φ1(p) = φ2(p) = 0, and such that the in-
tegral submanifolds for D and D⊥ are given respectively by the equations
(yd+1, . . . , yn) = (bd+1, . . . , bn) and (z1, . . . , zd) = (cd+1, . . . , cn) for constants
bi, cj. The map φ = (z1, . . . , zd, yd+1, . . . , yn), deﬁned in a neighborhood U
of p, is a local diﬀeomorphism at p with φ(p) = 0, thus it deﬁnes a coor-
dinate chart in some neighborhood of p. Taking a smaller neighborhood if
needed, and with the help of a linear change of coordinates in Rn, we can
assume that its image is (−1, 1)n as required.
(cid:3)

It is clear from the Lemma that, if N and N⊥ are the integral manifolds
for D and D⊥ through p in U , then U is diﬀeomorphic to N × N⊥. The aim
of this section is to ﬁnd conditions on a metric g in U such that (φ−1)∗g is
conformal to a product metric on N × N⊥. In order to do this, we need to
introduce the following 1–form Φ in M :

(1)

Φ(X) := Trg (cid:18) 1

dLX ⊥gD +

1

n − dLX D g⊥(cid:19)

6

P.ANGULO-ARDOY, D. FARACO AND L. GUIJARRO

Although the Lie derivative of some tensor T , X → LXT , is not tensorial in
X, we have that

(2) Lf X ⊥gD(Y, Z) = fLX ⊥gD(Y, Z) − gD(Y f X⊥, Z) − gD(Y, Zf X⊥) =
= fLX ⊥gD(Y, Z)

and similarly for LX D g⊥, so Φ is eﬀectively a 1-form.
Deﬁnition 2.2. A distribution D is said to be umbilical if there exists a
vector ﬁeld H ∈ D⊥, called the mean curvature vector ﬁeld of D, such that
for X, Y ∈ D and Z ∈ D⊥ it holds that
(3)

h∇XY, Zi = hX, Y ihZ, Hi

The relation of umbilicity to LCWs was already noted in [6].

Remark 2.3. If D is an arbitrary smooth distribution, then we can deﬁne
the second fundamental form of the distribution

II(X, Y ) = PD⊥(∇X Y )

where PD⊥ is the projection onto D⊥ and X, Y , are vector ﬁelds tangent
to D. It is easy to check that the distribution is integrable if and only this
form is symmetric, and in particular, an umbilical distribution is integrable.

Theorem 2.4. Let (M, g) be a Riemannian metric, and D, D⊥ integrable
distributions as above.

The following are equivalent:

(1) g is locally conformal to the product of the metric restricted to an
integral leave of D and the metric restricted to an integral leave of
D⊥;

(2) the Lie derivative of gD with respect to any vector ﬁeld in D⊥ is a
multiple of gD, the Lie derivative of g⊥ with respect to any vector
ﬁeld in D is a multiple of g⊥, and the 1-form Φ is closed;

(3) the distributions D and D⊥ are umbilic and, if H1 and H2 are the
respective mean curvature vector ﬁelds, H1 + H2 is a gradient vector
ﬁeld for the metric g.

Proof. (1) =⇒ (2) Let ˜g = eαg be a product metric of two metrics on the
leaves of D and D⊥. Using the chart (U, φ), there are symmetric tensors in
U such that ˜g is written as

˜g = (cid:18) eαg1

eαg2 (cid:19)

where the ﬁrst block does not depend on the coordinates of the second factor
and vice versa. This is equivalent to

LX ⊥(eαg1) = LX D (eαg2) = 0,

SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF LCWS

7

and also to

LX ⊥(g1) = −X⊥(α)g1
LX D (g2) = −X D(α)g2

Thus the ﬁrst part of (2) is immediate, and the second follows because

Φ(X) = −X(α) = −dα(X).

(2) =⇒ (1) D is integrable since, for X, Y ∈ D and Z ∈ D⊥:

g⊥([X, Y ], Z) = −(LXg⊥)(Y, Z) + X(g⊥(Y, Z)) − g⊥(Y, [X, Z])

= −cg⊥(Y, Z)
= 0

where we are using that LXg⊥ = cg⊥ for some function c. The integrability
of D⊥ is proved similarly.
U is simply connected, thus Φ being closed yields some function α such
that Φ = −dα. For an arbitrary vector ﬁeld X, the hypothesis in part (2)
gives some function c such that LX ⊥gD = cgD; taking traces in both sides,
and using that the dimension of D is d, we get that

c =

1
d

Trg(cid:0)LX ⊥gD(cid:1) = Φ(X⊥) = −dα(X⊥) = −X⊥(α),

thus LX ⊥gD +X⊥(α) = 0, and a simple computation yields LX ⊥(eαgD) = 0.
A similar procedure gives us LX D (eαg⊥) = 0, so the metric ˜g = eαg is a
product of two metrics on the leaves of D and D⊥.
(1) =⇒ (3) Let ˜g = eαg be a product of two metrics on the leaves of D
and D⊥ as before. A simple formula relates the Levi-Civita connections of
g and ˜g:

∇XY = ˜∇XY + g(X, Y )U − g(X, U )Y − g(Y, U )X

(4)
where U = −∇α. Thus for X, Y ∈ D and Z, W ∈ D⊥,
g(∇X Y, Z) = g(X, Y )g(U, Z)

so the projection of U onto D⊥ is the mean curvature of D and vice versa.
It follows that H1 + H2 = U , which is a gradient.

(3) =⇒ (1) Suppose H1 + H2 = −∇α, and deﬁne ˜g = e−αg. Equation

(4) shows that

g( ˜∇X Y, Z) = 0
g( ˜∇Z W, X) = 0

for X, Y ∈ D and Z, W ∈ D⊥.
It follows from equation (2.2) that umbilic distributions are integrable,
so by Lemma 2.1, we can ﬁnd a coordinate basis adapted simultaneously to

8

P.ANGULO-ARDOY, D. FARACO AND L. GUIJARRO

D and D⊥, i.e. {∂1, . . . , ∂d} span D and {∂d+1, . . . , ∂n} span D⊥. Then for
i ∈ {1 . . . d}, j, k ∈ {d + 1 . . . n}:

∂i˜gjk = ∂i(˜g(∂j, ∂k))

= ˜g( ˜∇∂i∂j, ∂k) + ˜g(∂j, ˜∇∂i∂k)
= −˜g( ˜∇∂j ∂i, ∂k) − ˜g(∂j, ˜∇∂k ∂i) − ˜g([∂i, ∂j], ∂k) − ˜g([∂i, ∂k], ∂j )
= −∂j(˜g(∂i, ∂k)) + ˜g(∂i, ˜∇∂j ∂k) − ∂k(˜g(∂i, ∂j )) + ˜g(∂i, ˜∇∂k ∂j)
= 0

so ˜g is a product metric.

(cid:3)

Related conditions can be found in the literature. For example, [15] in-
vestigates the case of warped products. However we have preferred to keep
our criteria as simple as possible.

3. Conformal factors in dimension three

This section combines the results of the previous section with an examina-
tion of the Cotton-York tensor of a metric g to describe when a 3-dimensional
manifold has a LCW. We refer the reader to [1] for some background on the
Cotton-York tensor. Recall that the space of algebraic Cotton-York tensors
at some given point p ∈ M coincides with the space of traceless symmetric
operators in TpM .

Deﬁnition 3.1. An eigenﬂag direction of a traceless symmetric oper-
ator in a three-dimensional euclidean space V is a one-dimensional vector
subspace L such that for any v ∈ L and w1, w2 ∈ L⊥, we have

CYp(v, v) = CYp(w1, w2) = 0

Suppose we are given a metric g in M ; Theorem 1.6 in [1] shows that
if a conformal metric ˜g admits a parallel vector ﬁeld, the subspace L that
generates is an eigenﬂag direction of the Cotton-York tensor of g at each
point of M .

We start by classifying the possible algebraic Cotton-York tensors in terms

of their eigenﬂag directions.

Lemma 3.2. An algebraic Cotton-York tensor CY falls into one of the
following categories:

• Every direction in V is eigenﬂag for CY; this agrees with the case
• There are exactly two eigenﬂag directions for CY; this agrees with
• There are not eigenﬂag directions; this is equivalent to the case

the case when CY is not null and det(CY) = 0.

when CY is null.

det(CY) 6= 0.

Proof. Lemma 5.1 in [1] shows that det(CY) = 0 if and only if CY has an
eigenﬂag direction, so assume that L is an eigenﬂag direction for CY. If v

SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF LCWS

9

is a unit vector along L, and {v, w1, w2} is an orthonormal basis of V , the
matrix of CY is given by

0 a b
a 0 0
b 0 0







(see Lemma 1.7 in [1]).

A further rotation with axis L changes the matrix of CY to the form

0 c 0
c 0 0
0 0 0







If CY is not zero, the null directions for this symmetric operator is the union
of the planes {x = 0} and {y = 0}. Thus only the orthogonals to those two
planes can be eigenﬂag directions.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.6. In the ﬁrst case, the metric is conformally ﬂat; in the
second it follows from Lemma 3.2 and Theorem 2.4.
(cid:3)

4. Classification of algebraic Weyl tensors of 4-manifolds

We would like to carry out a similar analysis for 4-dimensional manifolds
to the one we did in Section 3; however, the extra dimension brings out a
higher complexity, even at the level of algebraic Weyl operators. So in this
section, we will start by classifying such operators with respect to the size
of their set of eigenﬂag directions.

Proof of Lemma 1.9. Let W be a Weyl operator with an eigenﬂag direction
L = hvi. The operator W|hv∧v⊥i is symmetric, and diagonalizes in an or-
thonormal basis v ∧ e2, v ∧ e3, v ∧ e4. Deﬁne e1 = v, and eij = ei ∧ ej. It
follows from the properties of the Weyl operator that e23, e24 and e34 are
eigenvectors of W with the same eigenvalues as e14, e13, e12 respectively (see
the proof of Theorem 6.1 in [1]). Thus W diagonalizes as

(5)

W =

λ12

λ13

λ14









λ12

λ13

λ14

Recall that W is traceless, so λ12 + λ13 + λ14 = 0. If the three numbers
λ12, λ13, λ14 are diﬀerent, the operator has exactly three eigenspaces, each of
dimension 2. If two numbers coincide, there is one eigenspace of dimension
4 and a second eigenspace of dimension 2. Finally, the remaining possibility

10

P.ANGULO-ARDOY, D. FARACO AND L. GUIJARRO

is that the Weyl operator vanishes. This will account for the diﬀerent possi-
bilities in the statement of the Theorem, once we have related them to the
eigenﬂags. We will do this case by case.

Three diﬀerent eigenvalues. Suppose λ12 6= λ13 6= λ14; then the
eigenspace for λ12 is the set of bivectors of the form ae12 + be34, a, b ∈ R.
The Pl¨ucker relations imply that such bivector is simple only when ab = 0.
In other words, the only simple bivectors in the eigenspace for λ12 are the
multiples of either e12 or of e34. Changing i, j we get that every simple
eigenvector of W is a multiple of some eij, and consequently each one of the
ei’s is an eigenﬂag direction.

Suppose v were a vector spanning a diﬀerent eigenﬂag direction. Then
v ∧ v⊥ would be an eigenspace of W consisting of simple bivectors, so there
should be three orthogonal unit vectors wk ∈ v⊥ such that v ∧ wk are eigen-
vectors for W .
It follows that v ∧ w1 = eij for some i, j, which implies
that v, w1 ∈ span(ei, ej), and we can assume without lost of generality that
i = 1, j = 2. Then w2 ∈ (v, w1)⊥ = span(e3, e4), and v ∧ w2 can only be a
coordinate 2-plane if v = e1 or v = e2.
Two diﬀerent eigenvalues. Suppose λ12 = λ13 6= λ14. Let v = ae2+be3

be any vector in span(e2, e3). Then
v ∧ e1 = −ae12 − be13,

v ∧ e4 = ae24 + be34,

are eigenvectors of eigenvalue λ12, while

v ∧ (−be2 + ae3) = (ae2 + be3) ∧ (−be2 + ae3) = (a2 + b2)e23

is an eigenbivector of eigenvalue λ14. Therefore v ∧ v⊥ is an invariant sub-
space, and v is an eigenﬂag direction. A similar argument applies to any
vector in span(e1, e4) to show that it is an eigenﬂag direction, hence we only
need to prove that there are no additional eigenﬂag directions.

A general bivector in the λ12-eigenspace has the form ae12 + be34 + ce13 +

de24, and it is simple when

ab − cd = 0

This equation deﬁnes a 3-dimensional quadric in a 4 dimensional space,
and does not contain any linear space of dimension 3. If v is an eigenﬂag
direction, v ∧ v⊥ is an invariant subspace, and the restriction of W to v ∧ v⊥
diagonalizes in subspaces of the eigenspaces for W . Thus, v ∧ v⊥ must
intersect the eigenspace associated to λ14. The intersection is spanned by a
bivector v ∧ w, for some w ∈ v⊥, but the only simple eigenbivectors in the
eigenspace associated to λ14 are e14 and e23. If v∧ w = e14, this implies that
v ∈ span(e1, e4), while v ∧ w = e23 implies v ∈ span(e2, e3).

5. Conformal factors in dimension four

A 4-dimensional manifold may be conformal to a product in two diﬀerent
ways: a product R × N , with N a 3-dimensional manifold, or as a product
of two surfaces. Since we are going to use the Weyl tensor to distinguish

SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF LCWS

11

between the two cases, we will start by computing the Weyl operator of a
product of two surfaces.

Lemma 5.1. Let M1 and M2 be two Riemannian surfaces.

(1) The Weyl operator of M1 × M2 has type C or D at any point.
(2) It has type D at every point if and only if both surfaces have constant

curvature s1 and s2, and s1 + s2 = 0.

(3) If it has type C at a point p, then the two planes of eigenﬂag direc-
tions of Wp of Lemma 1.9 are the distributions tangent to the factors
M1 and M2 at p.

Proof. Taking isothermal coordinates (t, x) on M1 and (y, z) on M2, the
product metric is written as

g = 

We are now ready to distinguish those metric products of surfaces that

admit, simultaneously, a LCW.

Lemma 5.2. Let (M, g) be a product of surfaces that admits a limiting
Carleman weight ϕ. Let p ∈ M with Wp 6= 0; then there are coordinates
(t, x, y, z) around p in which g is written as

(cid:3)

g = 


eK(y,z)

eK(y,z)




for some functions J = J(x), K = K(y, z).

Proof. Since Wp 6= 0, Lemma 5.1 implies that W is of type C in some
neighborhood of p, and the set of eigenﬂag directions for the Weyl tensor of
g and ˜g is the union of the two planes h∂t, ∂xi and h∂y, ∂zi.
ture M1 × M2, as in the proof of Lemma 5.1.

Choose some coordinate system (t, x, y, z) adapted to the product struc-

Let ˜g be the rescaled metric

˜g = |∇ϕ|2g.

Lemmas 3.10 and 3.11 in [12] give that the vector ﬁeld A = ˜∇ϕ is a parallel
vector ﬁeld for ˜g. Theorem 1.3 in [1] shows that hAi must be an eigenﬂag
direction.
Without loss of generality, we will assume that A is in h∂t, ∂xi at every

point, hence there are functions α, β such that

A = α∂t + β∂x.

It follows from the deﬁnition of parallel vector ﬁeld that ∆, the distribu-
tion orthogonal to A, is integrable (see the proof of lemma 3.12 in page 57
of [12]). It is clear that

∆ = h −β∂t + α∂x, ∂y, ∂z i .

Denote B := −β∂t + α∂x; the integrability condition implies that

[B, ∂y] = (∂yβ)∂t − (∂yα)∂x ∈ ∆

and therefore [B, ∂y] must be in the B direction, i.e, [B, ∂y] = λ1B for some
function λ1; thus

Looking at [B, ∂z], we get

∂yβ = −λ1 · β,

∂yα = −λ1 · α

∂zβ = −λ2 · β,

∂zα = −λ2 · α

SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF LCWS

13

Next, observe that any integral submanifold of ∆ is foliated by surfaces
tangent to h∂y, ∂zi; since A is a parallel vector ﬁeld, its integral curves are
given by geodesics. Therefore, if we consider the maps

φ(t0,x0)(u, v, w) = exp(t0,x0,v,w) (uA) ,

we see that for each (t0, x0), the vector ﬁelds ∂u, ∂v, ∂w are mapped by the
diﬀerential of φ(t0,x0) to A, ∂y and ∂z, and therefore

[A, ∂y] = [A, ∂z] = 0.

On the other hand, writing A = α∂t + β∂x, we would get

[A, ∂y] = −(∂yα)∂t − (∂yβ)∂x,

[A, ∂z] = −(∂zα)∂t − (∂zβ)∂x.

The consequence of this is that λ1 = λ2 = 0, and every Lie bracket between
elements in the basis {A, B, ∂y, ∂z} vanishes, and hence they form a coor-
dinate basis for some set of coordinates about p. We will keep on denoting
them (t, x, y, z), although only the last two would coincide with the former.
The ﬁrst two, (t, x), will still, however, parametrize the ﬁrst factor of the
product structure of M . In this chart, ˜g is written as

˜g = 


b(t, x, y, z)

b(t, x, y, z)




(9)

where b is actually h(y, z)|∇ϕ|2(t, x, y, z).

Because A is parallel, it follows from Koszul formula

(10) 2g(∇X Y, Z) = ∂X (g(Y, Z)) + ∂Y (g(X, Z)) − ∂Z (g(X, Y ))

+ g([X, Y ], Z) − g([X, Z], Y ) − g([Y, Z], X),

that b does not depend on t (taking X = A, Y = Z = ∂y).

The metric ˜g is conformal to a product where the factors are tangent to
∂y be a unit vector in the

h∂t, ∂xi >= hA, Bi and h∂y, ∂zi. Let ˆ∂y = 1√b
direction of ∂y. We compute the Weyl operator in the basis

A ∧ B, A ∧ ˆ∂y, A ∧ ˆ∂z,

ˆ∂y ∧ ˆ∂z, B ∧ ˆ∂z, B ∧ ˆ∂y.

As mentioned in the proof of Lemma 5.1, if the metric is a product of
surfaces tangent to h∂1, ∂2i and h∂3, ∂4i, the oﬀ-diagonal elements in the
corresponding basis of Λ2(TpM ) must vanish at every p. Thus:

bbxy = bxby
bbxz = bxbz

Integrating the ﬁrst equation we get:
by

=

log(bx) = log(b) + C(x, z)

bx
b

= eC(x,z)

log(b) = D(x, z) + E(y, z)

and similarly, integrating the second, we get log(b) = F (x, y) + G(y, z).
Deﬁne r = log(b), and observe that rxy = rxz = 0, which in turn yields
rx = H(x), or r(x, y, z) = −J(x) + K(y, z).

Thus, in the basis {A, B, ∂y, ∂z}, the metric ˜g is written as

˜g = 

Undoing the change from g to ˜g shows that the matrix for g is as claimed
in the statement of the Theorem.
(cid:3)

We can now proceed with the proof of Theorem 1.10

Proof of Theorem 1.10. Assume S1 × S2 has a LCW tangent to the ﬁrst
factor; Lemma 5.2 shows that there are coordinates in S1 such that g1 can
be written in the form:

(11)

g = (cid:18) eJ(x)

eJ(x) (cid:19)

Clearly such a metric has ∂t as a Killing ﬁeld.

Assume now (S1, g1) has a Killing ﬁeld. Since in dimension two, any
Killing ﬁeld can be completed to a coordinate chart, we can assume that
there are coordinates where g1 is written as before. It is then clear that after
a change of coordinates of the form (t, x) → (t, λ(x)), with λ′(x) = eJ(x)/2,
the matrix of g becomes

g = (cid:18) e−J(x)

1 (cid:19)

which is a piece of a surface of revolution.

Finally, if (S1, g1) is a surface of revolution, take a chart as above; undoing
the change of coordinates (t, x) → (t, λ(x)) get a chart in the product where

SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF LCWS

15

the metric g1×g2 takes the expression appearing in Lemma 5.2. Multiplying
by the conformal factor e−J(x) shows that there is a LCW along ∂t.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.7. The main result of [1] shows that if Wp has type A,
there cannot be LCWs around p. Clearly, the same thing happens if p is in
the closure of the set of points with Type A Weyl operators.

If p has a neighborhood where every point has a Type C Weyl operator,
Lemma 1.9 shows that there are two orthogonal distributions D and D⊥;
the hypothesis of the Theorem assure that there is a conformal change such
that a neighborhood of p is isometric to a product of surfaces; since one of
them has a Killing ﬁeld, there is a LCW.

The case of a Type B neighborhood is similarly done. Finally, if W
vanishes in a neighborhood of p, the manifold would be conformally ﬂat
around p.
(cid:3)

6. A metric with Weyl tensor of constant type B, three of

the four eigenflag directions are conformal factors

Lemma 1.9 has an interesting consequence: if a manifold admits a LCW,
then it has at least four vector ﬁelds of eigenﬂag directions. In general, only
one of them will really correspond to a conformal factor. Theorem 6.1 below
shows a less usual case of a manifold with Weyl tensor of constant type B
that is conformal to a product along three of the four eigenﬂag directions.

at all points in an open set, but which is not conformal to a product. After
that, we show how to ﬁnd out all its LCWs.

The proof of 1.9 shows that the two 2-planes distributions of eigenﬂag
vectors are spanned by {∂t, ∂x} and {∂y, ∂z}. We deduce from Lemma 5.1
that our manifold can only be conformal to a product of two dimensional
manifolds tangent to the planes h∂t, ∂xi and h∂y, ∂zi.
However, Theorem 2.4 implies that if our metric were conformal to a
product metric, the distribution h∂y, ∂zi would be umbilical. But in that
case, it follows from Deﬁnition 2.2 that the following two numbers should
be the same

(15)

g(∇ ˆ∂y
g(∇ ˆ∂z

ˆ∂y, ∂x) = − 3
2x ,
ˆ∂z, ∂x) = 1

and we conclude that the metric is not conformal to a product metric.

Thus, the metric in the above Theorem is not covered by our Theorem 1.7.
It is obvious that ∂t is a parallel vector ﬁeld, while ∂y and ∂z are unit
1
parallel vector ﬁelds for the conformal metrics
x3 g and xg, respectively.
Thus, according to Theorem 1.1, the coordinate functions t, y and z are
LCWs.

In order to check if h∂xi is a conformal factor, we want to apply our
Theorem 2.4. The second fundamental form of {∂x}⊥ in the orthonormal

which is not a multiple of the identity. This means that {∂x}⊥ is not um-
bilical, and we deduce that h∂xi is not a conformal factor.
The analysis of the Weyl tensor shows that any possible conformal factor
must be contained in either h∂t, ∂xi or h∂y, ∂zi. Let us push Theorem 2.4 a
little bit further to ﬁnd all of them.

Let X be a unit vector ﬁeld in h∂t, ∂xi. X can be written in the form

X = cos(α)∂t + sin(α)∂x

for a real valued function α : M → R.
If X spans a conformal factor for some α, then hXi⊥ is an umbilical
distribution. X ∈ h∂t, ∂xi implies h∂y, ∂zi ⊂ hXi⊥, so in particular the form

Z → g(∇Z Z, X)

for Z ∈ h∂y, ∂zi must be a multiple of the identity. This tensor can be
written as a linear combination

g(∇Z Z, X) = cos(α)g(∇Z Z, ∂t) + sin(α)g(∇Z Z, ∂x)

but we notice that the ﬁrst summand is zero

Z → g(∇Z Z, ∂t) = 0

and we saw in (15) that the matrix of Z → g(∇Z Z, ∂x) in the orthonormal
basis { ˆ∂y, ˆ∂z} is not a multiple of the identity. Thus, the only combination
of them that produces a multiple of the identity is cos(α) = 1, sin(α) = 0.
The same trick will not help us decide whether there are conformal factors

of dimension 1 contained in h∂y, ∂zi. Instead, we deﬁne

Z = cos(α) ˆ∂y + sin(α) ˆ∂z

and compute the second fundamental form of Z⊥ in the basis

∂t,

∂x, − sin(α) ˆ∂y + cos(α) ˆ∂z.

We remark that for some choices of α the distribution Z⊥ is not integrable,
which is why the matrix

is not always symmetric. If Z⊥ is umbilical for some choice of α, then the
above matrix must be a multiple of the identity, and hence it would vanish
identically. In particular, −2 cos(α) sin(α) is zero, and since α is continuous,
we only have two choices: Z = ˆ∂y and Z = ˆ∂z.

(cid:3)

Remark 7.2. The above example, shows how even if the analysis of the
Weyl tensor yields an inﬁnite number of candidates to be one dimensional
conformal factors, a use of Theorem 2.4 allows to rule out the fake ones.
Notice that in this example, it happened that for the false candidates, Z⊥
was not umbilical. In the rare event (we do not know of any example) that

SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF LCWS

for false candidates Z⊥ was umbilical, the conditions on H1 + H2 being
a gradient ﬁeld would rule out those eigenﬂags directions not arising from
LCW.
