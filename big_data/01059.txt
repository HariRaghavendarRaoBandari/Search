Abstract

We consider the input/output-stability of linear time-invariant single-input/single-
output systems in terms of singularities of the transfer function F(s) in Laplace domain.
The approach is based on complex analysis. A fairly general class of transfer functions
F(s) is considered which can roughly be characterized by two properties: (1) F(s) is
meromorphic with a ﬁnite number of poles in the open right half plane and (2), on the
imaginary axes, F(s) may have at most a ﬁnite number of poles and branch points. For
this class of systems, a complete and thorough characterization of BIBO stability in
terms of the singularities in the closed right half-plane is developed where no necessity
arises to diﬀerentiate between commensurate and incommensurate orders of branch
points as often done in literature. A necessary and suﬃcient condition for BIBO
stability is derived which mainly relies on the asymptotic expansion of the impulse
response f(t). The second main result is the generalization of the well-known Nyquist
citerion for testing closed-loop stability in terms of the open-loop frequency response
locus to the class of systems under consideration which is gained by applying Cauchy’s
argument principle.

1 Introduction

Non rational transfer functions arise in various context: spatially distributed systems de-
scribed by partial diﬀerential equations [Sch81, Fra74, Deu12] or, more general, inﬁnite-
dimensional systems [CZ95], or systems with one or more dead-time elements, e.g.
re-
tarded quasi-polynomial (RQ) meromorphic functions [PZV08], or in fractional calculus

1

[Pet08, Mat96, Mat98]. The approach to these systems usually relies on the powerful methods
of functional analysis, and stability questions are formulated in terms of spectral properties
of operators between Banach or Hilbert spaces.

The present contribution focuses on an approach based on complex analysis for charac-
terizing input/output-stability of linear time-invariant single-input/single-output systems in
terms of singularities of the transfer function F (s) in Laplace domain. A fairly general class
of transfer functions is considered which can roughly be characterized by two properties:
(1) F (s) is meromorphic with a ﬁnite number of poles in the open right half plane (cid:60)s > 0
and (2), on the imaginary axes, F (s) may have at most a ﬁnite number of poles and branch
points. A correct description is given in section 4.
For this class of systems, a complete and thorough characterization of BIBO stability in
terms of the singularities in the closed right half-plane (cid:60)s ≥ 0 is developed where no necessity
arises to diﬀerentiate between commensurate and incommensurate orders of branch points
as often done in literature, cf. e.g. [Mat98, Pet08]. A necessary and suﬃcient condition for
BIBO stability is derived which mainly relies on the asymptotic expansion of the impulse
response f (t) = L−1{F (s)} [Doe74]. This result extends the stability conditions reported
in [Mat98] and diﬀers from that in [Pet08]. The second main result is the generalization of
the well-known Nyquist citerion for testing closed-loop stability in terms of the open-loop
frequency response locus to the class of systems under consideration which is gained by
applying Cauchy’s argument principle.
The paper is organized as follows:

in section 2 some stability deﬁnitions are reported
together with their relation to the impulse response. Section 3 gives an introduction to
isolated singularities, especially branch points and analytic continuation which forms the
important background for the subsequent sections and the complete contribution. In section
4, the assumptions on the open-loop systems under consideration are formulated and the
fundamental stability criterion is extended to this class of systems. In section 5 it is shown
that, under the same assumptions to the open-loop system, the extended criterion also holds
for the closed-loop systems. In section 6 the Nyquist criterion for testing closed-loop stability
is extended to the class of irrational transfer functions considered here, and in section 7 the
results are summarized.

2 Stability

We consider linear, time-invariant (LTI) SISO systems whose input-output behavior is de-
scribed by the convolution integral

(cid:90)

y(t) =

g(t − τ )u(τ )dτ .

u(t), y(t) denote input and output signal, respectively, with u(t) = y(t) = 0 for t < 0, and
the convolution kernel g(t) represents the impulse response of the system. We assume that

2

the system is causal which implies that also g(t) = 0 for t < 0. Then the convolution integral
results in

y(t) = g(t) ∗ u(t) =

g(t − τ )u(τ )dτ .

(1)

If g(t), u(t) grow at most exponentially as t → ∞, i.e. there exist constants M, α > 0 such
that |g(t)| ,|u(t)| ≤ M e−αt, then the Laplace integrals

t(cid:90)

τ =0

∞(cid:90)

G(s) = L{g(t)} =

g(t)e−stdt , U (s) = L{u(t)} =

t=0

t=0

exist and converge absolutely for (cid:60)s ≥ α. G(s), U (s) are bounded there and holomorphic
for (cid:60)s > α allowing the convolution integral (1) to be mapped to Y (s) = G(s) · U (s) with
Y (s) absolutely converging for (cid:60)s ≥ α as well [Doe74].
For LTI systems, stability is most commonly deﬁned as BIBO stability. A system is called
BIBO stable if |u(t)| < mu implies |y(t)| < Mu with constants mu, Mu depending on u(t).
Sometimes also a stability deﬁnition is used considering the asymptotic behavior of the step
response: a system is called ‘step response stable’, in short SR stable, if the system’s step
response

has a ﬁnite limit for t → ∞. SR stability is equivalent to (simple) convergence of the integral
of g(t):

t(cid:90)

τ =0

h(t) =

g(τ )dτ

SR stable ⇔ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ∞(cid:90)
∞(cid:90)

t=0

BIBO stable ⇔

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < ∞ ,

g(t)dt

|g(t)| dt < ∞ ,

(2)

(3)

whereas the stronger BIBO stability is equivalent to absolute convergence

for details see, e.g. [F¨ol13], or other textbooks. In [CZ95], exponential stability is considered.
We call a system β-exponentially stable where β ≤ 0 is any non-positive real number if there
exist positive constants M and a with a > −β such that

t=0

|g(t)| ≤ M e−at ,

∀t ≥ 0 .

3

If β = 0, we simply say the system is exponentially stable. Again, there is an equivalent
necessary condition in terms of an integral of the impulse response, which is also suﬃcient
if g(t) is bounded:

β-exponentially stable ⇔

|g(t)| e−β1tdt < ∞ for some β1 < β ,

(4)

∞(cid:90)

t=0

and

|g(t)| ≤ M < ∞ .

The proof is easy and given in the appendix. Thus, exponential stability (β = 0) implies
BIBO stability.

As an example, we consider a system with (bounded) impulse response g(t) = (t + 1)−3/2
√
which is clearly BIBO stable but not exponentially stable. It can be shown that the corre-
sponding transfer function G(s) has an asymptotic expansion G(s) ∼ 2 − 2
πs as s → 0
and thus has a branch point in s = 0. In the next example, let

stable. The transfer function has logarithmic branch points at s = ±jω.

0 g(t)dt = 1 and thus SR stable, but not BIBO

For ﬁnite-dimensional systems, where the transfer function G(s) is a proper rational func-
tion of s, these 3 stability deﬁnitions are equivalent, and the fundamental stability criterion
holds: Necessary and suﬃcient for stability is that all poles of G(s) have negative real parts.
The fundamental stability criterion has early been extended to some classes of non-rational
transfer functions, e.g.
in [F¨ol67] to SR-stability of closed-loop systems whose open-loop
transfer functions consist of a strictly proper rational transfer function Go(s) and a dead-
time element e−T s with T ≥ 0.

Below, we will extend the fundamental stability criterion in the sense of BIBO stability
to a wider class of LTI systems with non-rational transfer functions and analyse the role of
the singularities of G(s) with special regard to branch points.

3 Isolated Singularities

In the literature on complex analysis, isolated singular points are not treated uniformly with
respect to branch points. A frequently used deﬁnition is that given a function F (s) which

4

is holomorphic in some open region D ⊂ C except in s0 ∈ D, then s0 is called an isolated
singular point of F (s). According to this deﬁnition, there exist exactly three kinds of isolated
singular points: removable singular points, poles, and essential singularities [RS02], whereas
branch points do not belong to isolated singularities.
In our contribution, we follow W. I. Smirnov [Smi64] who deﬁnes isolated singularities via
the analytic continuation of holomorphic function elements. Starting from some point a ∈ C
where F (s) is holomorphic, this function element is extended along a curve L (cf. ﬁg. 1). If
the analytic continuation is possible up to some point b exclusively and not beyond, then b
is a singular point of F (s) for the analytic continuation along L.

Figure 1: Isolated singularity (b) and analytic continuation from a along L

Now a circle K is drawn around b and the section cb of L lying inside K is considered.
If a circle K exists such that the function elements starting in the points of section cb can
be analytically continued along every curve inside K, but not hitting b then b is called an
isolated singular point of F (s) for the curve L.

Either the analytic continuation along all curves in K with the same start and end point
yield the same function element - then we call F (s) single-valued or unambiguous - or there
will result diﬀerent function elements - then we call F (s) multi-valued or ambiguous.
If
F (s) is single-valued, then it is holomorphic in the whole interior of K except b and can be
developed in a series around b. The point b is - with respect to the analytic continuation
along L - either a removable singularity, or a pole, or an essential singularity.

If the analytic continuations in K are multi-valued, then b is a branch point, and either
a ﬁnite number m or inﬁnitely many diﬀerent function elements exist. In the former case,
b is called branch point of order m − 1, in the latter b is a branch point of inﬁnite order.
Subsequently, we will term branch points of ﬁnite order algebraic branch points.
For algebraic branch points of order m − 1, Smirnov introduces a Riemann surface where
√
F (s) can be unambiguously deﬁned (possibly except b) and developed in a Laurent series
with respect to the argument m

this kind of algebraic branch point is called ”regular-type branch point” and it holds F (s =

If the number of negative exponents in (5) is ﬁnite, the branch point is called
”polar-type branch point”. Finally, if the number of negative exponents is inﬁnite, this is
called ”essentially-singular-type branch point”, cf. [Smi64].
We extend our considerations to a more general class of functions including also inﬁnite-
order branch points of the type (s− b)κ with κ ∈ R. Instead of a Laurent series, the function
F (s) is now expressed near b by an asymptotic expansion. According to the notation used
in [Doe74], we develop F (s) in a sequence of comparison functions cν(s − b)κν , ν = 0, 1, . . .
which represent F (s) with increasing accuracy:

asymptotic expansion which is symbolically expressed by ”≈”:

Analogous to algebraic branch points, if κ0 ≥ 0, i.e. equation (7) does not contain any

branch point. Branch points with an inﬁnite number of negative exponents are excluded
from our consideration.

We conclude this section with some remarks:

1. From a mathematical point of view, if s = a is a removable singularity of F (s), it
is reasonable to deﬁne F (a) = lims→a F (s); by this, F (s) becomes regular in s = a,
like in the last example. In context of control issues, however, this could stand for
cancellation of singularities and should be handled with care. Nevertheless, below we
will exclude removable singularities from our consideration.

2. Subsequently, we also exclude essential and logarithmic singularities and restrict our-
selves to functions of the type (7). The asymptotic expansion (7) can also be used
to represent F (s) in the neighborhood of algebraic branch points of regular and polar
type (κν ∈ Q) or poles (κν ∈ Z), then yielding the respective Laurent series.

3. In the presence of branch points, functions are multi-valued. Unambiguity is achieved
on a Riemann surface with several (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) leaves.
In general, the exis-
√
tence of singularities depends on the path taken for analytic continuation, cf. example
s + 2)−1 above, and one might ask which leaf has to be chosen. In our context,
(
however, it will always be uniquely determined which leaf has to be taken since F (s)
represents the transfer function of a technical system. Applying Laplace transform
to the (uniquely deﬁned) impulse response f (t) yields unique F (s) in some right half
plane where analytic continuation can start from.

4 Open-loop stability

We consider the open-loop system shown in ﬁg. 2 on the left. fo(t) denotes the impulse
response and Fo(s) = L{fo(t)} the corresponding transfer function. The aim is to formulate
a necessary and suﬃcient condition for BIBO stability in terms of singularities of Fo(s).
Since closed-loop stability will be considered in the next section, we aim to characterize the
class of transfer functions under consideration in a way that also the closed-loop transfer
function Fcl(s) = Fo(s)

1+Fo(s) (cf. ﬁg. 2 on the right) belongs to this class.

Figure 2: Open-loop and closed-loop system

For the open-loop system, we meet the following assumptions (A1 ... A3).

A1: There is some α ≥ 0 such that

∞(cid:90)

|fo(t)| e−αtdt < ∞ .

(8)

t=0

Thus, Fo(s) = L{fo(t)} exists in the half-plane (cid:60)s ≥ α and is absolutely convergent there
permitting the description of the transfer behavior in the frequency domain. Furthermore,
Fo(s) is bounded for (cid:60)s ≥ α and holomorphic for (cid:60)s > α ([Doe74]).

Now, an open region D is deﬁned which is bounded to the left by a ”hooked angle” H
2 < ψ < π)

with center in s = 0, circular arc with radius r > 0 and half opening angle ψ ( π
as shown in ﬁg. 3 a).

A2:

In D, Fo(s) is assumed to be meromorphic with possible exception of a ﬁnite number
of regular or polar branch points bi on the imaginary axis together with their corre-
sponding cuts (parallels to the negative real axis). In the neighborhood of the branch
points, Fo(s) has the asymptotic expansion

A2 implies that in every bounded region within D, Fo(s) has at most a ﬁnite number of
branch points and cuts, as well as a ﬁnite number of poles, but no further singular points.
In general, meromorphic functions can have poles which accumulate at inﬁnity. But this is
excluded by A3: Since Fo(s) → 0 for s → ∞ in D, there exists a radius R > 0 such that
Fo(s) is holomorphic for |s| > R, s ∈ D. This region of holomorphy is denoted by B and
depicted in ﬁg. 3 b) as the shaded area. Thus, by A2 and A3, Fo(s) has at most a ﬁnite
number of branch points and cuts, and a ﬁnite number of poles within entire D.

Now, we give a generalization of the fundamental stability criterion for systems satisfying

the assumptions A1, A2, A3:

A linear time-invariant system of convolution type (1) with impulse
response fo(t) satisfying assumptions A1, A2, A3 is BIBO stable if
and only if all singular points of Fo(s) lie in the left half plane (cid:60)s < 0
with possible exception of a ﬁnite number of regular branch points on
the imaginary axis.

integrable and Fo(s) is holomorphic in (cid:60)s > 0 and bounded in (cid:60)s ≥ 0 [Doe74]. Thus the
closed half plane (cid:60)s ≥ 0 is devoid of poles. On the imaginary axis, there could be branch
points with 0 ≤ κi 0 < κi 1 < . . ., i.e. regular branch points.
2. Suﬃciency. For proving the suﬃcient part, we assume that all singular points of Fo(s)
lie in the left half plane (cid:60)s < 0 whereas on the imaginary axis we admit a ﬁnite number of
regular branch points bi = jωi, i = 1, 2, . . . with asymptotic expansions according to (9) and
κi ν ≥ 0. We have to show that this implies fo(t) to be absolutely integrable.

We choose the closed contour shown in ﬁg. 4 which is completely contained in region D

from ﬁg. 3. The contour consists of 4 parts:
(1) s = a + j y, ds = j dy, −Ω ≤ y ≤ Ω, (a ≥ α lying in the half plane of absolute

convergence of F0(s), cf. A1),

(2) s = x + j Ω, ds = dx, a ≥ x ≥ 0, and s = Ω ej ϕ, ds = j s dϕ, π/2 ≤ ϕ ≤ ˜ψ, (Ω

suﬃciently large),
the curve W of inclined rays (π/2 < ˜ψ ≤ ψ, small arcs circumventing branch points to
the right and parts of imaginary axis in between,

(3)

(4) s = Ω ej ϕ, ds = j s dϕ, − ˜ψ ≤ ϕ ≤ −π/2, and s = x − jΩ, ds = dx, 0 ≤ x ≤ a.

Since, by assumption, Fo(s) is holomorphic on the contour and inside, the integral of

Fo(s) es t where t > 0 yields

(cid:90)

Fo(s) es tds = 0 .

(1)+(2)+(3)+(4)

For Ω → ∞, the integrals along (2) and (4) tend to zero due to assumption A3, cf. [Doe74],
thus the integrals along (1) and (3) sum up to zero. Using the inversion formula of Laplace
transform, we obtain

fo(t) =

For the integral on the right, theorem 37.2 in [Doe74] applies. According to this theo-
rem, the asymptotic behaviour of the original function fo(t) as t → ∞ is represented by
superposition of the asymptotic expansions

The asymptotic behavior of fo(t) is dominated by the term with smallest exponent κi ν
contributing to (13). Due to (14), nonnegative integer values of κi ν have to be excluded
since they do not contribute to (13). Thus the dominant term is given by the minimum
{κi ν | κi ν /∈ N0}. Since by assumption, all κi ν
value of all non-integer exponents: κ∗ = min
are ≥ 0, it holds that κ∗ > 0. Finally we obtain for the impulse response

fo(t) =

and conclude that fo(t) is absolutely integrable over (0,∞) and thus BIBO stable. Hence
the proof is complete.

5 Closed-loop stability

In this section we consider BIBO stability of the closed-loop system depicted in ﬁg. 2 on the
right and show that the stability criterion derived in the last section is also applicable to the

11

0Hssa(1)(2)(3)(4)Wjjclosed-loop system. Therefore, we ﬁrst show that the closed-loop behavior is also described
by a transfer function in Laplace domain and secondly that the closed-loop transfer function
satisﬁes the assumptions (A1) to (A3) if the open-loop transfer function does.
We start with deﬁning the class L1,α of functions which, when multiplied by e−αt, are
Lebesgue integrable in the interval (0,∞) (with α ≥ 0). L1,α is a Banach space under the
norm

∞(cid:90)

(cid:107)f(cid:107)1,α :=

|f (t)| e−αt dt .

For the open-loop system in ﬁg. 2 where y(t) = fo(t)∗u(t), condition (8) now reads fo ∈ L1,α.
It is easily proven that for input signals u ∈ L1,α, also the output y belongs to L1,α. Thus we
can interprete the open-loop system as a linear operator A : L1,α → L1,α which is bounded
under the norm (cid:107)A(cid:107) = (cid:107)fo(cid:107)1,α.

0

Now we turn to the closed-loop system shown in ﬁg. 2 on the right. The time-domain

representation of the input/output behavior reads

y(t) = fo(t) ∗(cid:0)w(t) − y(t)(cid:1)

y = A (w − y) .

or

With the identity operator I, this can be converted into

(cid:0)I + A(cid:1) y = A w .

Then, the corresponding Neumann series(cid:80)∞

Due to (10), for fo(t) given, we can choose α suﬃciently large such that (cid:107)A(cid:107) = (cid:107)fo(cid:107)1,α < 1.
ν=0(−A)ν is uniformly convergent and I + A has

a bounded inverse, cf. e.g. [Heu92]. Thus,

y =(cid:0)I + A(cid:1)−1A w ∈ L1,α with (cid:107)(I + A)−1A(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)A(cid:107)

We can conclude that the Laplace integral Y (s) = (cid:82) ∞

t=0 y(t)e−stdt is absolutely convergent
for (cid:60)s ≥ α and the closed-loop system can be represented in Laplace domain by the transfer
function

1 − (cid:107)A(cid:107) .

Fcl(s) =

Fo(s)

A)−1A(cid:107), the norm of fcl(t) is bounded, thus (cid:82) ∞

and in time domain by the impulse response fcl(t) = L−1{Fcl(s)}. Since (cid:107)fcl(cid:107)1,α = (cid:107)(I +
|fcl(t)| e−αt dt < ∞ and by this we have

shown that A1 also holds for the closed-loop system.

Next we have to prove, that the assumptions A2 and A3 apply to Fcl(s). For proving A3

Next we turn to A2. Fo(s) was assumed to be meromorphic in the open region D with
exception of branch points on the imaginary axis and the corresponding cuts. Fcl(s) being
the quotient of two meromorphic functions is itself meromorphic in the same region.

It remains to consider the behavior of Fcl(s) in the neighborhood of branch points of Fo(s).
For simplicity, subsequently we will write b, cν, κν instead of bi, ci ν, κi ν. According to (9),
Fo(s) is represented by its asymptotic expansion

where κ0 < κ1 < . . . and cν (cid:54)= 0. If only the ﬁrst term is interesting, we write short

It should be mentioned, that the ”1” in the denominator of (17) has to be treated with care
since it depends on κ0 which term is dominant. Below, this will be illuminated in detail
diﬀerentiating 4 cases with diﬀerent values of κ0 and c0.

Case 2: κ0 = 0 and c0 (cid:54)= −1

(Fo(s) has a regular branch point in s = b)

13

Case 3: κ0 = 0 and c0 = −1

Here we need the ﬁrst two terms in Fo(s):

(Fo(s) has a regular branch point in s = b)

Fo(s) = c0(s − b)κ0 + c1(s − b)κ1(cid:0)1 + o(1)(cid:1) = −1 + c1(s − b)κ1(cid:0)1 + o(1)(cid:1)

where κ1 > κ0 = 0. For Fcl(s) we obtain

−1 + c1(s − b)κ1(cid:0)1 + o(1)(cid:1)
1 − 1 + c1(s − b)κ1(cid:0)1 + o(1)(cid:1) = − 1
c0(s − b)κ0(cid:0)1 + o(1)(cid:1)
1 + c0(s − b)κ0(cid:0)1 + o(1)(cid:1) = c0(s − b)κ0(cid:0)1 + o(1)(cid:1) .

Fcl(s) =

Case 4: κ0 > 0

In case 1, Fo(s) has a polar branch point, and in cases 2, 3, and 4 regular branch points
whereas Fcl(s) has a polar branch point in case 3 and regular ones else. Summarized we have
shown that the closed-loop transfer function belongs to the same class of transfer functions
satisfying the assumptions A1, A2, A3 and by this we can conclude that also the stability
criterion (11) applies to the closed-loop system.

6 Nyquist criterion

In this section, we extend the well-known Nyquist criterion to the class of open-loop transfer
functions characterized by A1, A2, A3 from section 4. As usual, the fundament for the
Nyquist criterion is Cauchy’s argument principle which can be found in most textbooks on
complex analysis, e.g. [Smi64]. First, we deﬁne the closed contour Γ shown in ﬁg. 5 a).
It consists of a semi-circle with (large) radius R and the section of the imaginary axis
between −jR and jR. If the open-loop or closed-loop transfer functions have singular points
(poles or branch points) on the imaginary axis, these are circumvented by small semi-circles
C with radius . The radius R is chosen suﬃciently large such that the outer region
|s| ≥ R , (cid:60)s ≥ 0 does not contain poles or branchpoints of Fo(s) or Fcl(s).  is chosen
suﬃciently small such that the interiors of the semi-circles, except their centers, do not
contain further singularities. In the interior of Γ, Fo(s) and Fcl(s) are meromorphic. Then
we can apply Cauchy’s argument principle:

(cid:90)

Γ

ds = 2π j(cid:0)P − Z(cid:1)

F (cid:48)
o(s)

1 + Fo(s)

(18)

where P and Z denote the numbers of poles and zeros of 1 + Fo(s) in the right half-plane
(cid:60)s > 0 (RHP), respectively (multiplicities are to be accounted for). (Since we integrate
clockwise, the sign on the right-hand side of (18) diﬀers from the usual formulation).

14

Figure 5: Nyquist contour

The poles of 1 + Fo(s) coincide with the poles of Fo(s), whereas the zeros of 1 + Fo(s) are
the poles of the closed-loop transfer function Fcl(s). We denote the number of RHP poles of
Fo by Po,+ and the number of RHP poles of Fcl by Pcl,+. Then, equation (18) reads

(cid:90)

ds = 2π j(cid:0)Po,+ − Pcl,+

(cid:1) .

F (cid:48)
o(s)

The integrand has the antiderivative log(cid:0)1 + Fo(s)(cid:1) = ln|1 + Fo(s)| + j 1 + Fo(s) and

1 + Fo(s)

Γ

we obtain the value of the integral by determining the increase of the antiderivative when
travelling along Γ. After one encirclement, the real part ln|1 + Fo(s)| ends in the same value
when starting thus it doesn’t contribute. Now let R → ∞. Since Fo(s) → 0 as |s| → ∞,
on the semi-circle the argument 1 + Fo(s) → 0 and the integral has to be taken along the
curve Γj shown in ﬁg. 5 b). If we denote the increase of argument along Γj by the symbol

(cid:1) .

(20)

In the last step, we consider the increase of argument along Γj if the radii of the semi-
circles tends to zero:  → 0. As shown in the appendix, for s = a being a pole of Fo(s)
with multiplicity k > 0, the increase of argument ∆a is −k π.
If s = a is pole of Fcl(s)
with multiplicity k > 0, ∆a = +k π. If s = a is a polar branch point of Fo with dominant

κ0 = 0, c0 = −1, the closed-loop systems has a polar branch point with dominant exponent
−κ1 < 0 and the increase of argument is ∆a = κ1 π. In the remaining cases of imaginary
branch points the increase of argument tends to zero as  → 0.

We combine these particular results by introducing the numbers Po,j and Pcl,j of poles
of Fo(s) and of Fcl(s) on the imaginary axis, respectively. For polar branch points on the
imaginary axis, we deﬁne equivalent (nonnegative) numbers by 2

Bo,j := − (cid:88)

Bcl,j :=

Equation (23) admits an interpretation in terms of the Nyquist plot:

the Nyquist plot z = Fo(jω) (cf. ﬁg. 6) as ω varies on the punctured j-axis (the singularities
being removed) from −∞ to ∞.

The relation (23) applies independently of any stability considerations. But due to the
generalized stability criterion (11), the closed-loop system is BIBO stable if and only if the
the closed-loop systems has no poles in (cid:60)s ≥ 0
numbers Pcl,+, Pcl,j, Bcl,j are zero, i.e.

(cid:1). If, conversely,

(cid:1) holds,

then equation (23) is only satisﬁed if 2Pcl,+ + Pcl,j + Bcl,j = 0. Since Pcl,+, Pcl,j and Bcl,j
are nonnegative, this implies Pcl,+ = Pcl,j = Bcl,j = 0, thus the closed-loop system is BIBO
stable.
1Thus, in a sense, −κ0 can be interpreted as ”multiplicity” of the polar branch point.
2In a similar manner Bo,j, Bcl,j can be interpreted as ”total number” of polar branch points including their

”muliplicities”.

16

Figure 6: Ray from z = −1 to the current point on the Nyquist plot

Now we can formulate the generalized Nyquist citerion:

Assuming the open-loop system to have a transfer function Fo(s) sat-
isfying the assumptions A1, A2, A3. The total number of poles of
Fo(s) in the right half plane and on the j-axis is Po,+ and Po,j, re-
spectively. Furthermore, the ”total number” of polar branch points on
the j-axis according to (21) is Bo,j. Then, the closed-loop system is
stable if and only if the change of argument of the ray pointing from
z = −1 to the current point z = Fo(j ω) on the Nyquist plot, as ω
varies on the punctured j-axis from −∞ to ∞, equals

ω=−∞ 1 + Fo(jω) = π(cid:0)2Po,+ + Po,j + Bo,j

+∞
∆•

(cid:1) .

(24)

It should be noted that in literature when the open loop system has poles on the imaginary
axis, the limit  → 0 is often not performed. Instead, semi-circles with small, but ﬁnite radius
 to the left-hand side of the singularities are considered (in that case, the Nyquist plot is a
ﬁnite closed curve). For branch points on the imaginary axis, however, this procedure does
not work, since integration along semi-circles on the left-hand side would cross the cuts and
thus is not allowed. If, on the other hand, the change of argument along ﬁnite semi-circles
on the right-hand side is considered, (20) reveals no information on potential singularities
inside the semi-circle.

For illustration, we consider an example where the open-loop transfer function is

Fo(s) =

K

s3/2 (s + 1)

with K > 0 .

Fo(s) has a pole in s = −1 and a polar branch point in s = 0 with κ0 = −3/2, thus
Po,+ = Po,j = 0, Bo,j = 3/2. The Nyquist plot is shown in ﬁg. 7; it intersects the negative

7 Conclusion

In this contribution, we considered linear, time-invariant SISO systems with non-rational
transfer function from a perspective of complex analysis and singularities of the transfer
function. We derived generalized criteria for BIBO stability and for the Nyquist test for
closed-loop stability in terms of singularities with special focus on branch points on the
imaginary axis. The class of transfer functions under consideration comprises systems with
dead-time, retarded quasi-polynomial (RQ) meromorphic functions, fractional-order systems
and the IO behavior of many systems with spatially distributed parameters. In context of
BIBO stability, our approach makes a distinction between commensurate and incommensu-
rate orders of branch points obsolete. Some limiting assumptions were made: for example we
did not yet consider systems with impulse response containing distributions like in [CZ95],
and we excluded certain kinds of branch points like logarithms. This will be the focus of
future work as well as a comparison of our approach to those of [Pet08] and [Mat98].

Proof of the increase of argument of imaginary singular points

The Nyquist criterion derived in section 6, makes use of the increase of argument when
integrating along the semi-circles as shown in ﬁg. 5 c). When calculating these values we
have to diﬀerentiate between poles and the 4 kinds of branch points as already considered
at the end of section 5.
ds = j  ej ϕdϕ = j (s − a)dϕ with −π/2 ≤ ϕ ≤ π/2.

On the semi-circle with center a and radius  shown in ﬁg. 5 c), s = a +  ej ϕ and

If s = a is a pole of Fo(s) with multiplicity k > 0, then near a,

a similar manner

Thus, the integral along the semi-circle yields

If Fo(s) has a regular branch point in s = a with κ0 = 0 and c0 (cid:54)= −1,then
