We perform neutrino radiation-hydrodynamics simulations for the merger of asymmetric binary
neutron stars in numerical relativity. Neutron stars are modeled by soft and moderately stiﬀ ﬁnite-
temperature equations of state (EOS). We ﬁnd that the properties of the dynamical ejecta such
as the total mass, neutron richness proﬁle, and speciﬁc entropy proﬁle depend on the mass ratio
of the binary systems for a given EOS in a unique manner. For the soft EOS (SFHo), the total
ejecta mass depends weakly on the mass ratio, but the average of electron number per baryon (Ye)
and speciﬁc entropy (s) of the ejecta decreases signiﬁcantly with the increase of the degree of mass
asymmetry. For the stiﬀ EOS (DD2), with the increase of the mass asymmetry degree, the total
ejecta mass signiﬁcantly increases while the average of Ye and s moderately decreases. We ﬁnd again
that only for the soft EOS (SFHo), the total ejecta mass exceeds 0.01M(cid:12) irrespective of the mass
ratio chosen in this paper. The ejecta have a variety of electron number per baryon with its average
approximately between Ye ∼ 0.2 and ∼ 0.3 irrespective of the EOS employed, which is well-suited
for the production of the r-process heavy elements (second and third peaks), although its averaged
value decreases with the increase of the degree of mass asymmetry.

INTRODUCTION

The merger of binary neutron stars is one of the
most promising sources of gravitational waves for ground-
based advanced detectors, such as advanced LIGO, ad-
vanced VIRGO, and KAGRA [1]. Among them, ad-
vanced LIGO already started the ﬁrst observational run
and has achieved the ﬁrst direct detection of gravitational
waves, which were emitted from a binary-black-hole
merger [2]. We should expect that these gravitational-
wave detectors will also detect the signals of gravita-
tional waves from binary-neutron-star mergers in a few
years, because the latest statistical studies suggest that
these gravitational-wave detectors will observe gravita-
tional waves from merger events as frequently as ∼ 1–
100/yr if the designed sensitivity is achieved [3–5].

Binary-neutron-star mergers are also attracting atten-
tion as one of the major nucleosynthesis sites of heavy el-
ements produced by the rapid neutron capture process (r-
process) [6], because a signiﬁcant fraction of the neutron-
rich matter is likely to be ejected during the merger
(see Ref. [7] for the pioneering work). Associated with
the production of the neutron-rich heavy elements in the
matter ejected during the merger, a strong electromag-
netic emission could be accompanied by the radioactive
decay of the r-process heavy elements [8–10]. This will
be an electromagnetic counterpart of gravitational waves
from binary-neutron-star mergers and its detection could
be used to verify the binary-neutron-star-merger scenario
for the r-process nucleosynthesis. This hypothesis is en-
couraged in particular by the observation of an infrared
transient event associated with a short-hard gamma-ray

burst, GRB 130603B [11]. These facts strongly encour-
age the community of gravitational-wave astronomy to
theoretically explore the mass ejection mechanisms, the
r-process nucleosynthesis in the ejecta, and associated
electromagnetic emission in the mergers of binary neu-
tron stars.

For the quantitative study of these topics, we have
to clarify the merger process, subsequent mass ejection,
physical condition of the ejecta, nucleosynthesis and sub-
sequent decay of the heavy elements in the ejecta, and
electromagnetic emission from the ejecta. For these is-
sues, a numerical-relativity simulation, taking into ac-
count the detailed microphysical processes and neutrino
radiation transfer, is the unique approach. In our previ-
ous paper [12], we reported our ﬁrst numerical-relativity
results for these issues focusing only on the equal-mass
binaries. We found that the total mass of the dynami-
cally ejected matter during the merger depends strongly
on the equations of state (EOS) we employed, while the
ejecta components have a wide variety of electron number
per baryon (denoted by Ye) between ≈ 0.05 and ≈ 0.5 ir-
respective of the EOS employed (see also Refs. [13–16]).
The broad Ye distribution is well-suited for explaining
the abundance patterns for the r-process heavy elements
with the mass number larger than ∼ 90 in the solar sys-
tem and ultra metal-poor stars [17].

In this article, we extend our previous study focus-
ing on the merger of asymmetric binary neutron stars:
We will report our latest numerical results for unequal-
mass binary systems of typical neutron-star mass (be-
tween 1.25 and 1.45M(cid:12)) for a soft (SFHo) EOS [18] and
a moderately stiﬀ (DD2) EOS [19]. We will show that

the physical properties of the merger ejecta depend on
the degree of the mass asymmetry of the system: The
ejecta mass varies with the mass ratio for a ﬁxed value of
the binary total mass, and the averaged value of Ye de-
creases with the increase of the mass asymmetry degree,
although Ye is always broadly distributed irrespective of
the mass ratio.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we brieﬂy
review the formulation and numerical schemes employed
in our numerical-relativity simulation, and also summa-
rize the EOS we employ. In Sec. III, we present numer-
ical results focusing on the dynamical mass ejection and
properties of the merger remnants. Section IV is devoted
to a summary. Throughout this paper, c and G denote
the speed of light and the gravitational constant, respec-
tively.

II. METHOD, EOS, INITIAL MODELS, AND

GRID SETUP.

We

solve Einstein’s

equation by a puncture-
Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura formalism as be-
fore [12, 20, 21]. The fourth-order ﬁnite-diﬀerencing
scheme is applied to discretize the ﬁeld equations except
for the advection terms for which the lop-sided scheme
is employed. The radiation hydrodynamics equations are
solved in the same manner as in Ref. [12]: Neutrino ra-
diation transfer is computed in a leakage scheme [22] in-
terpolating Thorne’s moment formalism with a closure
relation for a free-streaming component [23, 24]. For neu-
trino heating, which could induce a neutrino-driven wind
from the merger remnant, absorption on free nucleons is
taken into account.

We employ a soft (SFHo) [18] and a moderately stiﬀ
(DD2) [19] EOS for the nuclear-matter EOS, which have
been derived recently by Hempel and his collaborators.
For these EOS, the predicted maximum mass for spher-
ical neutron stars is 2.06M(cid:12) and 2.42M(cid:12), respectively,
and larger than the largest accurately-measured mass of
neutron stars, ≈ 2.0M(cid:12) [25]. The radius of neutron stars
with mass 1.35M(cid:12) for them is R1.35 = 11.9 km (SFHo
EOS) and 13.2 km (DD2 EOS), respectively. These radii
depend very weakly on the mass as long as it is in a
typical neutron-star mass range between 1.2 and 1.5M(cid:12).
Thus, we refer to an EOS with R1.35 ≤ 12 km like SFHo
EOS as soft EOS. The stellar radius plays a key role for
determining the merger remnant and the properties of
the dynamical ejecta as we already described in our pre-
vious paper [12].

In numerical simulations, we have to follow the ejecta
with the typical velocity 0.2c, which expand to > 103 km
in ∼ 20 ms. To follow the ejecta motion as well as to
resolve neutron stars and merger remnants, we employ
a ﬁxed mesh-reﬁnement algorithm. As in our previous
work [12], we prepare 9 reﬁnement levels with the vary-
ing grid spacing as ∆xl = 29−l∆x9 (l = 1, 2,··· , 9) and
all the reﬁnement levels have the same coordinate ori-

2

gin. Here, ∆xl is the grid spacing for the l-th level in
Cartesian coordinates. For each level, the computational
domain covers the region [−N ∆xl, N ∆xl] for x- and y-
directions, and [0, N ∆xl] for z-direction (the reﬂection
symmetry with respect to the orbital plane located at
z = 0 is imposed). In the high-resolution run, we assign
N = 285, ∆x9 = 150 m (for the SFHo EOS) or 160 m
(for the DD2 EOS), and utilize ≈ 7, 000 CPUs on the K
computer. Thus the location of outer boundaries along
each axis is L (cid:38) 104 km and matter ejected from the cen-
tral region never escape from the computational domain
in our simulation time (cid:46) 60 ms. To check whether the
numerical results depend only weakly on the grid resolu-
tion, we also performed lower-resolution simulations for
several models. For this case, N = 160 and ∆x9 = 250 m
(for the SFHo EOS) or 270 m (for the DD2 EOS) and
we conﬁrm a reasonable convergence. We note that since
good convergence is found for the models shown in Ta-
ble I, we do not perform the low-resolution runs for all
the models. In the following, the ﬁgures are plotted using
the results by the high-resolution runs.

Choice of the ﬂoor density, which has to be put in
a dilute-density or vacuum region outside the neutron
stars and merger remnant when using the conservative
form of hydrodynamics in numerical simulations, is one
of the crucial artiﬁcial points for accurately exploring the
mass ejection during the merger process. In this study,
we set the ﬂoor density to be 1.67 × 104 g/cm3. The
ﬂoor values of Ye and temperature are 0.47 and 0.1 MeV,
respectively. For this case, the artiﬁcial ﬂoor does not
aﬀect the quantitative results of the mass ejection for ∼
30 ms after the onset of the merger. In our experiments,
we also performed simulations with the ﬂoor density 2 ×
105 g/cm3.
In this case, the inertia of the atmosphere
is too high to follow the ejecta motion accurately: The
eﬀect of the atmosphere appeared on the ejecta at ∼
In particular for
10 ms after the onset of the merger.
the case that the ejecta mass is small ((cid:46) 10−3M(cid:12)), this
artiﬁcial eﬀect is serious: For example, the ejecta mass
steeply decreases with time for such a low-mass ejecta
case because the ejecta are decelerated signiﬁcantly. We
ﬁnd that it is necessary to reduce the ﬂoor density much
below 105 g/cm3 to follow the ejecta for suﬃciently long
time until the ejecta motion approximately relaxes to a
free expansion stage 1.

We consider binary neutron stars with each mass be-
tween 1.25M(cid:12) and 1.45M(cid:12) ﬁxing the total mass to be
2.7M(cid:12). Neutron stars observed in compact binary sys-
tems typically have the mass ratio between 0.9 and 1.0,
and each mass in the range 1.23–1.45M(cid:12) [26]. Thus,

1 Our numerical results for the ejecta mass is much larger than
those by Ref. [13] in which simulations are also performed using
the SFHo and DD2 equations of state. We speculate that one
of the reasons for this would be that our ﬂoor density is much
smaller than that in Ref. [13] which employs 5 × 105 g/cm3. See
Sec. III B for another reason.

our choice reasonably reﬂects the observational fact. The
initial orbital separation is chosen so that the orbital an-
gular velocity, Ω, satisﬁes Gm0Ω/c3 = 0.028 where m0
denotes the total mass, i.e., m1 + m2 = 2.7M(cid:12), and
m1 and m2(≤ m1) are the mass of each neutron star in
isolation. Table I lists the key parameters of our mod-
els and simulation setup. We deﬁne the mass ratio by
q := m2/m1(≤ 1).

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

A. Summary of the merger process

For all the models we employ in our simulations, a
massive neutron star (MNS) is ﬁrst formed after the onset
of the merger as expected from our previous results [12,
27] (see also our earlier papers [28]). The MNS are long-
lived in the sense that their lifetime is much longer than
their dynamical time scale and rotation period (cid:46) 1 ms.
The subsequent evolution of the MNS depends on the
equations of state employed.
For the models with the SFHo EOS, the MNS with
mass (cid:38) 2.6M(cid:12) is hypermassive (see Refs. [29, 30] for the
deﬁnition of the hypermassive neutron star) because the
maximum mass of spherical and rigidly rotating cold neu-
tron stars is only ≈ 2.06M(cid:12) and ≈ 2.45M(cid:12), respectively,
which are smaller than the remnant MNS mass. As a
result, the MNS collapses to a black hole at ∼ 10 ms af-
ter the onset of the merger irrespective of the mass ratio
after the angular momentum inside the MNS is redis-
tributed by the gravitational torque associated with the
non-axial symmetric matter distribution or is dissipated
by the gravitational-wave emission.

The mass and dimensionless spin parameter of the

formed black holes are ≈ 2.6M(cid:12) and ∼ 0.65–0.70, re-
spectively, and the remnant black holes are surrounded
by a torus with mass ∼ 0.05–0.1M(cid:12) and with their typ-
ical extent in the orbital plane ∼ 100 km (see Table I
and Sec. III C for more details). Such a compact torus
would be subsequently evolved by a magneto-viscous pro-
cess with the typical lifetime τv ∼ (αvΩ)−1 where αv is
the so-called α-parameter for viscous hydrodynamics and
τv ∼ 102 ms (αv/10−2)−1 for Ω = O(103 rad/s) (see, e.g.,
Ref. [31]). Thus, for a plausible value of αv ∼ 0.01, this
system is a candidate for the central engine of short-hard
gamma-ray bursts with the duration less than one sec-
ond, like GRB 130603B [11] (see also Sec. III E).
For the DD2 case, any of the formed MNS does not
collapse to a black hole in our simulation time ∼ 50 ms.
This is reasonable because the maximum mass of spher-
ical and rigidly rotating cold neutron stars for the DD2
EOS is high, i.e., ≈ 2.42M(cid:12) and 2.8M(cid:12), respectively, and
hence, the formed hot MNS with mass ∼ 2.6M(cid:12) are not
hypermassive and cannot collapse to a black hole before a
substantial fraction of the angular momentum and ther-
mal energy are dissipated or carried away, respectively,
by some angular-momentum transport processes and the
neutrino emission (for which the cooling time scale is
longer than 1 s; e.g., Refs. [21, 27]). The hot remnant
MNS would be long-lived with their lifetime longer than
a few seconds and could be a strong emitter of neutrinos,
which can modify the chemical property of the ejecta via
the neutrino irradiation process (see Sec. III C).

We specify the matter as the ejecta if the lower time
component of the ﬂuid four velocity, ut, is smaller than
−1 as before [12]. We note that this condition agrees
approximately with the condition hut < −1 where h is
the speciﬁc enthalpy. The reason for this is that h is close
to unity for the ejecta components moving far from the
merger remnant located in the central region. In Table I,
we also summarize the total rest mass, the averaged value
of Ye, and the averaged velocity of the ejecta, Vej, all of
which are measured at t − tM−6 ≈ 30 ms. Here, Vej is

deﬁned by(cid:112)2Ekin/Mej where Ekin is total kinetic energy

of the ejecta.

Figure 1 illustrates that the ejecta mass depends
strongly on the EOS employed, as already described in
Ref. [12]: For the smaller value of R1.35, the ejecta mass
is larger (see also Ref. [13]). Figure 1 also shows that for
the models with the SFHo EOS, the ejecta mass depends
weakly on the binary mass asymmetry, while for those
with the DD2 EOS, it increases steeply with the increase
of the degree of the binary mass asymmetry. As already
described in our study of Ref. [32] in which piecewise
polytropic EOS is employed, this is due to the fact that

there are two major dynamical mass ejection mechanisms
(see also Ref. [33]): shock heating and tidal interaction
(i.e., tidal torque exerted by elongated two neutron stars
and highly non-axisymmetric merger remnants). For the
equal-mass or slightly asymmetric case, the shock heat-
ing is the primary player of the dynamical mass ejection
for neutron stars with soft EOS like the SFHo EOS, while
the tidal torque is the primary player for binary neutron
stars with stiﬀ EOS like the DD2 EOS.

The shock heating eﬃciency during the merger phase
decreases with the increase of the binary asymmetry de-
gree because the smaller-mass neutron star in such asym-
metric systems is tidally elongated just prior to the onset
of the merger, avoiding the coherent collision with the
heavier companion at the merger. Thus, for the models
with the SFHo EOS, the shock heating eﬀect is weakened
with the increase of the binary asymmetry degree while
the importance of the tidal eﬀect is enhanced. As a result
of this change in the dynamical mass ejection mechanism,
the ejecta mass slightly decreases with the change of q
from unity to a smaller value to ∼ 0.9. However, with
the further decrease of q (i.e., with the further increase
of the degree of the mass asymmetry), the ejecta mass
increases because the enhanced tidal eﬀect dominates the
reduced shock heating eﬀect.

On the other hand, for the DD2 models the tidal inter-
action is always the primary mechanism for the dynam-
ical mass ejection. The importance of the tidal eﬀect is
further enhanced with the increase of the mass asymme-
try degree for this EOS, monotonically increasing the dy-
namical ejecta mass. Thus, for signiﬁcantly asymmetric

binaries, the typical ejecta mass would approach 10−2M(cid:12)
irrespective of the EOS employed. We note that the total
ejecta mass depends only weakly on the grid resolution
as listed in Table I.

As shown in Fig. 1, the ejecta mass increases with time
for the ﬁrst ∼ 10 ms after the onset of the merger. This is
in particular observed for the SFHo models with q (cid:38) 0.9
and all the DD2 models. This indicates that we have to
follow the ejecta motion at least for ≈ 10 ms after the
onset of the merger. In a recent simulation of Ref. [13],

they estimated the properties of the ejecta at (cid:46) 5 ms after
the onset of the merger, perhaps because of their small
computational domain employed (L = 750 km). How-
ever, the ejecta mass would still increase with time in
such an early phase. This could be one of the reasons
that our results for the ejecta mass are much larger than
theirs. Figure 1 also shows that the average of Ye still
signiﬁcantly varies with time for the ﬁrst ∼ 5 ms after
the onset of the merger. This also shows that it would
be necessary to determine the properties of the ejecta at

the SFHo EOS (left) and the DD2 EOS (right), respectively (note that the scales in the vertical axis are diﬀerent among the
plots). For heavy neutrinos, the contribution from only one heavy species is plotted. The vertical dashed lines in the left panel
shows the time at the formation of a remnant black hole. We note that the relatively high heavy-neutrino luminosity for the
SFHo models before the collapse to the remnant black holes reﬂects the fact that the temperature of remnant MNS is higher
and the pair-process neutrino emission is more active than those for the DD2 model.

(cid:38) 10 ms after the onset of the merger (if the average of
Ye is estimated at ∼ 5 ms after the onset of the merger as
in Ref. [13], the average of Ye could be underestimated).
Irrespective of the EOS and mass ratios, the averaged
ejecta velocity is in the range between 0.15c and 0.25c,
as found in Refs. [12, 16, 32]. As we already pointed out
in Ref. [32], the ejecta velocity is higher for softer EOS
and this shows that the shock heating eﬀect enhances the
ejecta velocity. On the other hand, the ejecta velocity
depends only weakly on the mass ratio (as long as it
is in the range 0.85 < q ≤ 1), although it is slightly
increased for signiﬁcantly asymmetric binaries like 1.25–
1.45M(cid:12) models.

As described earlier in this section, shock heating and
tidal interaction are two major dynamical mass ejection
mechanisms. By the tidal torque, the matter tends to be
ejected near the orbital plane because the tidal-force vec-
tor primarily points to the direction in this plane. On the
other hand, by the shock heating, the matter is ejected
in a quasi-spherical manner like in supernova explosion.
Because both eﬀects play a role, the dynamical ejecta
usually have a spheroidal morphology [32].

For the SFHo models, the shock heating plays a pri-
mary role for the equal-mass or slightly asymmetric case,
and hence, the dynamical ejecta in this case have a quasi-
spherical morphology. However,
for the signiﬁcantly
asymmetric case, e.g., with q ∼ 0.85, the tidal eﬀect be-
comes appreciable, as already mentioned, and hence, the
anisotropy of the dynamical ejecta is enhanced. On the
other hand, for the DD2 models, the tidal torque always
plays a primary role for the dynamical mass ejection.

Thus, with the increase of the binary asymmetry degree,
this property is further enhanced, and the anisotropy of
the dynamical ejecta morphology is increased. Here, we
note that the degree of the anisotropy is correlated with
the neutron-richness of the dynamical ejecta because (i)
the tidally ejected components are less subject to the
thermal weak-interaction reprocess associated with the
shock heating preserving the neutron-rich nature of the
original neutron-star matter and (ii) the neutrino irra-
diation is less subject to the matter near the equatorial
plane than that near the polar region (see the discussion
in Sec. III C).

Six panels of Fig. 2 display the proﬁles of the electron
number per baryon, Ye, (left side of each panel) and spe-
ciﬁc entropy, s, (right side of each panel) of the ejecta
on the x-y and x-z planes for the SFHo (top panels)
and DD2 (lower panels) models. For the SFHo and DD2
models, the snapshots at t− tM−6 ≈ 13 ms and 10 ms are
plotted, respectively. The left, middle, and right panels
display the results for 1.35-1.35M(cid:12), 1.30-1.40M(cid:12), and
1.25-1.45M(cid:12), respectively. This ﬁgure shows a clear de-
pendence of the properties of the dynamical ejecta on the
binary asymmetry degree and on the EOS employed as
follows:
(I) For the SFHo models, the speciﬁc entropy of the ejecta
decreases steeply with the increase of the binary asym-
metry degree in particular near the orbital plane. This
is due to the fact that the eﬀect of the shock heating at
the onset of the merger, which contributes a lot to the
dynamical mass ejection, becomes weak with the increase
of the binary asymmetry degree.

nent with low values of Ye increases with the increase of
the binary asymmetry degree: For the equal-mass case,
the ejecta with Ye (cid:38) 0.2 are the primary components
while for the 1.25–1.45M(cid:12) model, those with Ye (cid:46) 0.2
are primary (in particular for the components near the
orbital plane). This is due to the following fact: For a
high temperature environment, e−e+ pair-creation is en-
hanced, and consequently, the positron capture reaction,
n + e+ → p + ¯νe, eﬃciently proceeds in neutron-rich mat-
ter, resulting in the increase of Ye. With the increase of
the binary asymmetry degree, the shock heating eﬀect
becomes less important and the temperature for a sub-
stantial fraction of the dynamical ejecta is decreased. As
a result, the positron production and resulting positron
capture are suppressed. Hence, the neutron richness is
preserved to be relatively high (the value of Ye is pre-
served to be low).
(III) For the DD2 models, the eﬀect associated with the
binary asymmetry found for the SFHo model is not very
remarkable: The typical values of Ye and speciﬁc entropy
depend mildly on the binary asymmetry degree, although
we still observe a monotonic decrease of these values (see,
e.g., Fig. 1). This weak dependence is due to the fact that
the ejecta are composed primarily of tidally-ejected mat-
ter irrespective of the mass ratio, as already mentioned.

C. Neutrino irradiation

For the DD2 models, the remnant massive neutron
stars are long-lived, while for the SFHo models, the rem-
nants collapse to a black hole in ∼ 10 ms after the onset of
the merger. Therefore, a high-luminosity neutrino emis-
sion is continued for a long time scale from the remnant
of the DD2 models, while the strong emission continues
only brieﬂy for the SFHo models (see Fig. 3). As a re-
sult, a long-term neutrino-irradiation eﬀect [12, 34, 36–
38] plays an important role for heating up the ejecta and
for increasing the value of Ye (see Fig. 1), in particular
in the region above the remnant MNS pole (see Fig. 2)
in the DD2 model.

As we pointed out in Ref. [12], the reason for the in-
crease of Ye by the neutrino irradiation is as follows: The
luminosity of electron neutrinos emitted from the rem-
nant hot MNS is quite high as shown in Fig. 3. In such an
environment, neutrino capture processes, n+νe → p+e−
and p + ¯νe → n + e+, are activated in the matter sur-
rounding the MNS. By the balance of these reactions, the
fractions of neutrons and protons are determined and the
equilibrium value of Ye will be given by (e.g., Ref. [39]),

and L¯νe denote the luminosity of νe and ¯νe, respectively.

For the DD2 models, (cid:104)νe(cid:105) ≈ 10 MeV, (cid:104)¯νe(cid:105) ≈ 15 MeV,
and L¯νe/Lνe ≈ 1.0–1.3, and consequently, the equilib-
rium value is Ye ≈ 0.45–0.5. Due to the neutrino irradi-
ation, the neutron richness of the originally neutron-rich
matter with Ye (cid:46) 0.1 is decreased (the average of Ye is
increased) towards the equilibrium value.

However, this neutrino irradiation eﬀect depends on
the binary asymmetry because, as Fig. 3 shows, the neu-
trino luminosity decreases with the increase of the bi-
nary asymmetry degree (this is in particular seen clearly
among the DD2 models). A time scale for the increase
of the average Ye may be estimated approximately as

where r is the coordinate radius, σνen and σ ¯νep are the
cross-sections of the νe absorption on neutrons and ¯νe
on protons, respectively. Here, we set (cid:104)νe(cid:105) = 10 MeV,
(cid:104)¯νe(cid:105) = 15 MeV, Lνe = L¯νe = Lν, Xn = 1 − (cid:104)Ye(cid:105), and
Xp = (cid:104)Ye(cid:105) with (cid:104)Ye(cid:105) = 0.2. Thus, for the asymmetric
binaries for which Lν is smaller than that for the equal-
mass binary, the time scale to increase Ye by the neutrino
irradiation is longer, as found in Fig. 1: It shows that the
rate for the long-term increase in (cid:104)Ye(cid:105) is smaller for the
more asymmetric binary models.

By this neutrino irradiation, the ejecta mass is also in-
creased (see Fig. 1). This is in particular the case for
the DD2 models with the equal-mass or weakly asym-
metric systems, for which the remnant MNS is long-lived
and a long-term increase of the ejecta component is ob-
served. For the SFHo models, the MNS is hypermassive
and collapses to a black hole in ∼ 10 ms after the onset
of the merger, reducing the neutrino luminosity. Thus,
the eﬀect of the neutrino irradiation is less important
irrespective of the binary asymmetry degree.

D. Mass distribution of Ye

The eﬀect of the binary asymmetry is also reﬂected
in the mass distribution of Ye in an appreciable manner
in particular for the SFHo models. Figure 4 shows his-
tograms for the ejecta mass fraction as a function of Ye at
t − tM−6 ≈ 25 ms, at which the total (dynamical) ejecta
mass and the averaged value of Ye approximately settle
to relaxed values.

For the equal-mass or slightly asymmetric cases with
the SFHo EOS, the ejecta typically have high values of
the speciﬁc entropy due to strong shock heating at the
onset of the merger (see Fig. 2). As a result of this high
value (i.e., the high value of temperature), e−e+ pair-
creation is enhanced and subsequently positron capture,
n + e+ → p + ¯νe, eﬃciently proceeds, resulting in the
increase of (cid:104)Ye(cid:105). Because the shock heating eﬀect for the
SFHo models is more signiﬁcant than that for the DD2

8

high and also neutrinos escape eﬃciently from the torus
because the optical depth is small.

On the other hand, for the SFHo-125-145 model (also
for the SFHo-130-140 model), the torus mass and maxi-
mum density are higher than those for the SFHo-135-135
model. In this case the maximum density is higher than
∼ 1012 g/cm3, the electron degeneracy is higher than that
for the SFHo-135-135 model, and a part of neutrinos is
trapped. Then, the β-equilibrium among neutrons, pro-
tons, electron, and neutrinos as n + νe ↔ p + e− and
p + ¯νe ↔ n + e+ is approximately satisﬁed. Since the
electron degeneracy is high, the resulting value of Ye is
lower than that for the SFHo-135-135 model.
Irrespective of the binary mass asymmetry, the result-
ing compact torus has high temperature ∼ 10 MeV and is
cooled dominantly by the neutrino emission. Hence the
torus is the neutrino-dominated accretion torus. The or-
der of magnitude for the neutrino luminosity (for νe and
¯νe) is 1052 ergs/s (see Fig. 3). Thus, the pair annihilation
of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos to the electron-positron
pair, which is not taken into account in our present sim-
ulation, would be activated and could modify the dy-
namics of the merger remnants (e.g., Refs. [40, 41]). In
addition, the system has a low density region above the
black-hole pole. Such a system satisﬁes the conditions
for the central engine of short-hard gamma-ray bursts.

Massive tori will be subsequently evolved by magne-
tohydrodynamics (MHD) or viscous processes in real-
ity: Angular momentum inside the tori will be redis-
tributed and associated with this eﬀect, matter in the
tori will be heated up. Then, the geometrical thickness
of the tori will be increased, and possibly, an outﬂow that
ejects the matter from the outer part of the tori could be
launched [31, 35–38]. The total rest mass of the ejected
matter could reach 10% of the initial torus mass, accord-
ing to the previous studies. This suggests that the ejecta
with mass of the order 0.01M(cid:12) could follow the dynam-
ical mass ejection. We need to explore this process in
our future study. On the other hand, the luminosity of
neutrinos emitted is not as high as that by the remnant
MNS. Thus, neutrino irradiation would not be as impor-
tant as the MHD/viscous eﬀect for the mass ejection in
the black hole-torus system.

For the DD2 models, the ﬁnal outcome is a MNS sur-
rounded by a massive torus as displayed in Fig. 5. Al-
though the central object is diﬀerent from a black hole,
the surrounding matter distribution and velocity proﬁle
(close to the Keplerian motion) are similar to those for
the SFHo models. Because the density of the MNS and
torus is higher than the torus surrounding the black hole
found in the SFHo models, the low value of Ye caused by
the electron degeneracy is clearly observed in the DD2
models. As in the torus surrounding black holes, the
torus around the MNS would be subject to the MHD or
viscous eﬀects [38], and hence, it is natural to expect a
substantial fraction of mass ejection from the surround-
ing matter. Because the MNS is long-lived for the DD2
models, it is also natural to expect that the neutrino ir-

respectively. The data at t − tM−6 ≈ 25 ms are employed.

models, the averaged value of Ye for the ejecta of the
SFHo models is higher than that of the DD2 models for
the equal-mass or slightly asymmetric cases (see Fig. 1).
On the other hand, in the presence of appreciable bi-
nary asymmetry, not only the shock heating but also the
tidal eﬀect become important in the dynamical mass ejec-
tion even for the SFHo models. As a result, the fraction
of matter with low values of Ye is increased. This is
clearly observed in Fig. 4, which shows that the value of
Ye at the peak gradually shifts to the lower-value side
and in particular for the 1.25–1.45M(cid:12) model, the peak
Ye value is smaller than 0.2 both for the SFHo and DD2
models. However, even in such appreciably asymmet-
ric cases, the dynamical ejecta have a broad distribu-
tion in Ye. This is the universal qualitative feature and
well-suited for producing a variety of r-process heavy el-
ements [17].

E. Properties of the merger remnant

We brieﬂy touch on the properties of the merger rem-
nants located around the central region because the torus
around the central merger remnant could be the origin of
the further long-term mass ejection (e.g., Refs. [35–37]).
For the SFHo models, the outcome for t−tM−6
(cid:38) 15 ms is
a rotating black hole surrounded by a massive torus irre-
spective of the mass ratio, as displayed in Fig. 5. For the
SFHo-135-135 model, the torus mass is ≈ 0.05M(cid:12) and
its maximum density is less than 1012 g/cm3. For such
relatively low density, the electron degeneracy is not very

DD2-125-145h (bottom right) at 30 ms after the onset of the merger. The ﬁlled circles (in black or white) in the top panels
denote the inside of black holes.

radiation to the surrounding matter plays an important
role for inducing long-term mass ejection.

In the DD2 models, the torus mass and torus extent
for the asymmetric binaries are larger than that for the
equal-mass one as in the SFHo models. This shows
that the binary asymmetry increases not only the dy-
namical ejecta mass but also the torus mass. This sug-
gests that the mass of the matter ejected by subsequent
MHD/viscous eﬀect would be also enhanced in the asym-
metric models.

The outer part of the torus surrounding the central ob-
ject, that is most subject to the mass ejection from the
torus, is in general hot and the value of Ye is not very
small ((cid:38) 0.35). This suggests that the ejecta would not
be very neutron-rich and less subject to producing the
heavy r-process elements, although they could be sub-
ject to producing relatively light r-process elements. Ex-
ploring the torus-originated components of the ejecta in a
self-consistent study from the merger simulation through-
out the subsequent remnant evolution will be an impor-
tant issue to fully understand the mass ejection mecha-
nism in the binary-neutron-star merger event. We plan
to explore this issue in our future work.

It is interesting to point out that for the DD2 models,
the density in the region above the MNS pole is as low as
(cid:46) 107 g/cm3 for t − tM−6
(cid:38) 20 ms. Since the luminosity
of electron neutrinos and anti-neutrinos emitted from the
remnant MNS is high, ∼ 1053 ergs/s, for the DD2 models,
the νe ¯νe pair annihilation would be active near the MNS.
According to a simple order of magnitude estimate, the
pair annihilation luminosity is given by (e.g., Refs. [40,
42])

pair annihilation is enhanced. This luminosity is high
enough for launching short-hard gamma-ray bursts like
GRB 130603B even for the case that the merger rem-
nant is surrounded by dynamical ejecta, as demonstrated
in Ref. [43]. Because the density of the polar region in the
vicinity of the MNS is low, high speciﬁc entropy would
be achieved in the presence of the νe ¯νe pair annihila-
tion. This suggests that a strong outﬂow or a jet may
be launched from this system. If a suﬃciently high spe-
ciﬁc entropy is achieved, a relativistic jet responsible for
a short-hard gamma-ray burst could be indeed launched
even from the remnant MNS. Including the νe ¯νe pair an-
nihilation in our simulation will be an important next
step.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We have reported our latest numerical results of neu-
trino radiation hydrodynamics simulations for binary-
neutron-star mergers in general relativity, focusing on
the dynamical mass ejection from the merger of asym-
metric binary neutron stars with typical mass for each
neutron star (1.25–1.45M(cid:12)) and with two representative
ﬁnite-temperature EOS. The following is the summary of
our ﬁnding:

1. The dynamical ejecta mass depends weakly on the
mass ratio for the SFHo (soft-EOS) models. The
reason for this is that while the dynamical mass
ejection from equal-mass or nearly equal-mass sys-
tem is induced primarily by shock heating and this
eﬀect becomes weak with the increase of the de-
gree of the binary asymmetry, the tidal eﬀect com-
pensates the weakened shock-heating eﬀect for the
mass ejection in the asymmetric systems.

2. The dynamical ejecta mass depends signiﬁcantly on
the binary asymmetry degree for the DD2 (moder-
ately stiﬀ-EOS) models; it is ≈ 2× 10−3M(cid:12) for the
equal-mass case while it is ≈ 5 × 10−3M(cid:12) for the
1.25–1.45M(cid:12) model. The reason for this is that
the tidal torque, which plays a major role for the
dynamical mass ejection in this EOS, is simply en-
hanced.

3. The averaged value of Ye decreases appreciably
with the increase of the degree of the binary asym-
metry irrespective of the EOS employed, and the
peak value of Ye becomes less than 0.2 for the 1.25–
1.45M(cid:12) models.

4. Ye of the ejecta has a broad mass distribution be-
tween ≈ 0.05 and ≈ 0.5 irrespective of the EOS
and mass ratios. This property is well-suited for
producing a variety of r-process heavy elements as
illustrated in Refs. [16, 17].

5. The neutrino irradiation eﬀect to the dynamical
ejecta, which is clearly found for the DD2 mod-
els, becomes weak as the binary asymmetry degree
increases. The reason for this is that binary asym-
metry reduces the shock heating eﬃciency at the
onset of the merger, and as a result, the tempera-
ture of the remnant MNS is decreased, reducing the
luminosity of the neutrino emission from the MNS.

In our previous paper [12], we found for the equal-
mass binary merger that the total ejecta mass is larger
for softer EOS. It exceeds 0.01M(cid:12) only for the case
that R1.35 (cid:46) 12 km and it is of the order 10−3M(cid:12) for
R1.35 > 13 km. For the case that the ejecta mass might
be of the order 10−3M(cid:12), it would be too small to explain
the total mass of r-process heavy elements (the so-called
second and third-peaks elements) in our galaxy, unless

the galactic merger rate of binary neutron stars is un-
expectedly high [44] or some other ejection mechanisms
such as the disk wind are present. Our present simula-
tions show that the ejecta mass can be increased in the
presence of an appreciable mass asymmetry of the binary
systems even for the case that R1.35 = 13.2 km. This sug-
gests that even if the EOS is not very soft, the observed
total mass of the r-process heavy elements in our galaxy
may be explained in the presence of a substantial frac-
tion of the asymmetric merger events. Here, we stress
that even from such asymmetric systems, neutron-rich
matter with a variety of Ye could be ejected.
Nevertheless, if a large fraction of the asymmetric bi-
nary merger has a mass ratio of q (cid:46) 0.9, the averaged
value of Ye would be small (cid:46) 0.2 even if the EOS is soft.
In such case, although a substantial amount of the heavy
r-process elements around the second and third peaks
could be produced, the light elements around the ﬁrst
peak would not be signiﬁcantly produced [16, 17]. If this
scenario is the case, we have to rely on other components
such as disk-wind components [35, 37], which can be pro-
duced in the merger remnant for a time scale longer than
the dynamical one.

As we mentioned above, the r-process elements are
likely to be produced in the neutron-rich ejecta. Be-
cause most of the produced r-elements are unstable, they
subsequently decay and the released energy will be the
source for an electromagnetic signal, in particular in the
near-infrared optical band [9, 10]. Our present study in-
dicates that irrespective of the EOS and mass ratios, the
ejecta mass is larger than 10−3M(cid:12). Under this condition,
the expected observed magnitude in the near-infrared op-
tical bands is smaller than 24 magnitude for an event
at 100 Mpc from the earth. Such an event can be ob-
served by Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) of the Subaru tele-
scope with one-minute-duration observation [45]. Since
HSC (in operation now) can simultaneously observe a
ﬁeld of ≈ 1.75 deg2, a wide ﬁeld of ∼ 100 deg2 can be
surveyed in one night by it. Even if the position de-
termination by gravitational-wave detectors is not very
good (e.g., Ref. [46]), this wide-ﬁeld observation will en-
able us to ﬁnd a counterpart of the gravitational-wave
events. These facts indicate that this radio-actively pow-

11

ered electromagnetic signal is the promising electromag-
netic counterpart of binary-neutron-star mergers even for
the gravitational-wave observation with a small number
of detectors (by which the accuracy of the position de-
termination is not very high).

Light curves for this emission have been calculated for
the dynamical ejecta [9, 10], based on the numerical re-
sults for it. Only in the presence of the dynamical ejecta,
the luminosity simply decreases with time in a power-law
manner after the peak luminosity is reached in 1–10 days
after the merger (the peak time depends on the wave
length). Here, in the presence of disk-wind components,
we will have two diﬀerent types of the sources and hence
the electromagnetic signals from the ejecta will be signif-
icantly modiﬁed [47].

For the observation of the electromagnetic counter-
parts, we need a reliable theoretical prediction for the
light curves. This is in particular the case for search-
ing the electromagnetic counterparts of short duration.
For this issue, we have to take into account all the possi-
ble components other than the dynamical ejecta like the
disk-wind components. We plan to explore this issue in
the subsequent work.
