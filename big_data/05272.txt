Abstract

Expanding upon [arXiv:1404.4472, 1511.06079], we provide further detailed analysis of Ba˜nados
geometries, the most general solutions to the AdS3 Einstein gravity with Brown-Henneaux
boundary conditions. We analyze in some detail the causal, horizon and boundary struc-
ture, and geodesic motion on these geometries, as well as the two class of symplectic charges
one can associate with these geometries: charges associated with the exact symmetries and
the Virasoro charges. We elaborate further the one-to-one relation between representations
of two copies of Virasoro group (Virasoro coadjoint orbits) and Ba˜nados geometries. We
discuss that the information about the Ba˜nados goemetries fall into two categories: “orbit
invariant” information and “Virasoro hairs”. The former are geometric quantities while the
latter are speciﬁed by the non-local surface integrals. We elaborate on multi-BTZ geometries
which have some number of disconnected pieces at the horizon bifurcation curve. We study
multi-BTZ black hole thermodynamics and discuss that the thermodynamic quantities are
orbit invariants. We also comment on the implications of our analysis for a 2d CFT dual
which could possibly be dual to AdS3 Einstein gravity.

Introduction

Three dimensional gravity has very interesting features and has been long viewed as a testing
ground for ideas in semiclassical and quantum gravity [1]. 3d Einstein gravity on ﬂat (or AdS3,
dS3) backgrounds do not have propagating degrees of freedom and all solutions to these theories

1

are locally ﬂat (or AdS3, dS3). Nevertheless, it is well known that they admit nontrivial solutions
[2], including black holes [3]. One can in fact classify all the solutions to these theories with
prescribed boundary conditions. In this paper we will focus on the AdS3 gravity case and analyze
family of locally AdS3 geometries with Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions [4].

These solutions, the Ba˜nados geometries, which were ﬁrst discussed in [5], are speciﬁed by two
arbitrary periodic functions L+ = L+(x+) and L− = L−(x−), L±(x±+2π) = L±(x±). Although all
Ba˜nados geometries are locally AdS3 and locally diﬀeomorphic to each others, it is now established
that these geometries are physically distinct, as one can specify them with quasi-local, conserved
surface charges, see [6]. This latter is also reﬂected in the fact that there are no everywhere smooth
coordinate transformations which respect the periodicity in x± and can bring theses geometries
to global or Poincar´e patch AdS3 [6].

In fact, one can distinguish two kinds of such conserved charges: those associated with exact
symmetries (Killing symmetries) of the Ba˜nados solutions and those which are in the family of
symplectic symmetries.1 See [6, 7] for a detailed discussion on the concepts and the terminology.

If we denote the generators of the exact symmetries by J± and those of symplectic symmetries
by Ln, ¯Ln, one can show that the latter form two (left and right) copies of Virasoro algebras at
Brown-Henneaux central charge c [4] and that J± commute with each other and also with all Ln, ¯Ln
[6]. Since these two sets are commuting, one may hence label the geometries by J± as well as the
Virasoro charges. As discussed in [6] (see also [8, 9]) one may then classify Ba˜nados geometries by
the product of representations of the two, left and right, Virasoro groups, the Virasoro coadjoint
orbits [10, 11]. Each Virasoro orbit is generically labelled by an integer and a continuous real
number2 and then “states” in a given orbit are fully speciﬁed once we also give their Virasoro
charges, the “Virasoro hairs”. The goal of this paper is to elaborate further on the results of [6, 12]
and on the one-to-one relation between two copies of Virasoro orbits and Ba˜nados geometries.

The picture we depict here will correct and complete the one given in [12]: The informa-
tion about Ba˜nados geometries available to local observables of the usual classical GR, the
geometric notions such as geodesic length, causal and boundary structure and the black hole
(thermo)dynamics quantities like surface gravity and horizon angular velocity, entropy, are “orbit
invariant quantities”. That is, all geometries which fall into the same orbit share these properties,
regardless of their “Virasoro hair”. On the other hand, the information about the Virasoro hair
are semiclassical, in the sense that they are of the form of surface non-local (“quasi-local”) charges;
the Virasoro charges may be viewed as the “hair” on classical geometries which all have the same
mass, angular momentum and causal structure. Given this picture, one may then hope to obtain
a full quantum description upon quantization of Virasoro coadjoint orbits. We shall provide some
discussions on the latter point in the end, a thorough analysis is left to upcoming works.

To this end, in section 2 we analyze geometric aspects of Ba˜nados solutions. This includes
reviewing their Killing vectors [12], analyzing the horizon and boundary structure of these geome-
tries and geodesic motion on these geometries. In section 3, we analyze charges associated with

1Note that the notion of symplectic symmetries extend the notion of asymptotic symmetries discussed in [4], in
the sense that the charges are not only deﬁned at the AdS3 boundary, but also on any codimension two, compact,
spacelike curve in the bulk.

2As we will discuss in detail in section 4, these two labels are not enough to uniquely specify the orbit and we

need to also specify the type of the orbit.

Ba˜nados metrics. In section 4, we give a review of Virasoro coadjoint orbits and their classiﬁca-
tion. Also in this section, we discuss the 3d Ba˜nados geometry associated with Virasoro coadjoint
orbits. The last section is devoted to a summary and outlook. In an appendix we have given
details of special, but important cases, the geometries corresponding to Virasoro coadjoint orbits
with constant character representative.

2 Ba˜nados geometries and their causal structure

In this paper we focus on the most general solutions to the AdS3 Einstein gravity equations,

Rµν = −

2
ℓ2 gµν ,

(2.1)

with Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions [4]. These solutions are all locally AdS3 with local
sl(2, R)× sl(2, R) isometries. The Ba˜nados solutions in the Feﬀerman-Graham gauge [13] is given
by [5]

ds2 = ℓ2 dr2

r2 − (rdx+ −

ℓ2
r

L−dx−)(rdx− −

ℓ2
r

L+dx+) ,

(2.2)

where L+ = L+(x+) and L− = L−(x−) are arbitrary smooth, periodic functions, L±(x± + 2π) =
L±(x±).
In this work we assume that x± ∈ [0, 2π] and parametrize two circles. The x±, r
coordinate system used in (2.2) will be called Ba˜nados coordinate system, or Ba˜nados gauge.
Similar solution in other gauges, e.g.
in the Gaussian null coordinates (also called BMS gauge)
has been constructed and analyzed [6, 14]. For metrics (2.2),

det g = −

ℓ2
4r6 (r4 − r4

0)2,

0 ≡ ℓ4L+L−.
r4

(2.3)

We note that r2 can in principle assume negative values and in principle r2 ∈ R. However, at
large r, the metrics (2.2) take the form

ds2 ≈ ℓ2 dr2

r2 − r2dx+dx−,

and without loss of generality one may choose x± = τ ± ϕ, where ϕ ∈ [0, 2π] is a spacelike circle
while τ is a timelike coordinate. This is in accord with the fact that causal boundary of the
geometry is (part of) the cylinder parametrized by x±. With this choice, to avoid appearance of
Closed Timelike Curves (CTC), at least in large r region, we need to take r2 to be positive in this
region; i.e. r2 cannot become too negative. Moreover, as we will argue the allowed range of r2
covers the geometry twice. As a rough argument for the latter, note that if r4
0 > 0 then in r2 ≪ 1
region the metric essentially takes the same form as r2 ≫ 1 region. We shall discuss range of r
and other coordinates further in the later sections. The BTZ black hole family [3], corresponds to
special case of constant positive L±. We have discussed cases with constant L± in the Appendix.

2.1 Diﬀeomorphisms preserving the Ba˜nados gauge

The geometries (2.2) are written in a speciﬁc coordinate system, the Ba˜nados gauge. This co-
ordinate system, extends the Feﬀerman-Graham coordinates (which are usually deﬁned near the

3

boundary at large r), to arbitrary r. The Ba˜nados gauge is hence deﬁned by the “gauge ﬁxing
conditions”

grr =

1
r2 ,

gr+ = gr− = 0.

(2.4)

One may then ask what is the “residual” diﬀeomorphisms which preserve the Ba˜nados gauge.
This question was explored and answered in [6]:

χ[ǫ+, ǫ−] = χr∂r + χ+∂+ + χ−∂−,

where ǫ± = ǫ±(x±) are two arbitrary, periodic functions, i.e. ǫ±(x±) = ǫ±(x± + 2π) and prime
denotes derivative with respect to the argument.

Although χ diﬀeomorphisms keep the form of metric invariant, they generically shift functions

2.2 Killing vectors of Ba˜nados geometries

Killing vectors ζ, with Lζg = 0, should have the form (2.5) but for speciﬁc ǫ’s satisfying δζL± = 0.
We will denote the corresponding ǫ’s by K±. Therefore, Killing vectors are of the form [12]

ζ[K+, K−] = ζ r∂r + ζ +∂+ + ζ −∂−,

(2.7b)

(2.8)

Since the notion of Killing vector is a local one, every solutions to (2.8) generate a Killing vector,
regardless of the fact that the corresponding K± are periodic or not. The above third order equa-
tions have six linearly independent solutions. These solutions constitute the six local isometries of
Ba˜nados geometries which satisfy sl(2, R) × sl(2, R) algebra, as expected, recalling that Ba˜nados
geometries are locally AdS3 [12]. K±(x±) functions which solve (2.8) are not necessarily periodic.
Therefore, not all of the associated six Killing vector ﬁeld are “globally deﬁned”.

It was noted in [12] that (2.8) may be solved through a second order Schrodinger type equation:

If the two linearly independent solutions to the above are denoted as ψ1, ψ2 and φ1, φ2, then it is
easy to verify that

ψ′′ − L+ ψ = 0 ,

φ′′ − L− φ = 0.

Recalling that L± are periodic smooth functions, Floquet theorem implies that [12, 15]

ψ1 = eβ+x+
φ1 = eβ−x−

ψ2 = e−β+x+

(2.11)

where Pi, Qi are periodic smooth functions and β± are two constants built from L±. In general
β± are two complex numbers and without loss of generality we can take Re(β±) ≥ 0. Discussions
of [15] reveals that, although Pi, Qi are generically 4π periodic, P1P2 and Q1Q2, and hence com-
binations like ψ1ψ2, ψ1/ψ2, ψ′
2/ψ2 which have geometric meaning, are all 2π periodic.
Therefore, in general case with Re(β±) 6= 0, only two of the six Killings, those generated by
+, K 0
K 0

−, are periodic. Hereafter, we will use the notation

1/ψ1 and ψ′

K+ = ψ1ψ2 ,

K− = φ1φ2 ,

(2.12)

for the functions generating the two periodic global Killing vectors which will be denoted by ζ+ and
ζ−. In other words, the Ba˜nados geometries in general have U(1)+ × U(1)− compact isometries.3
The above construction makes it clear that solutions to (2.9), and hence solutions to (2.8), are
implicit functions of L±, i.e. K+ = K+(L+(x+)), K− = K−(L−(x−)). In particular, we note that
K± are only functions of L± and not their derivatives L′

±.

2.3 Horizon and asymptotic boundary behavior

Any linear combination of the two global Killing vector ﬁelds ζ± is also a Killing vector. One may
easily check that with the normalization (2.10) and (2.12), |ζ+|2 = |ζ−|2 = ℓ2/4, while ζ+ · ζ− 6= 0
is a nontrivial function. There is a certain combination of the two Killings which are normal to
each other:

The norm of these vectors are given as

ζH± ≡ ζ+ ± ζ− .

3There are special Re(β+) and/or Re(β−) = 0 cases where more Killings are periodic. These cases may have
four or six global Killings. The latter happens only for global AdS3 with L± = −1/4, β± = 0 where we have
Sl(2, R) × Sl(2, R) global isometry.

(2.17)

Note: Although most of the statements in this subsection is also true for generic β± (cf. (2.11)),
in sections 2 and 3, we will be assuming that β± are real-valued.

2.3.1 Killing horizons and bifurcation surfaces

At the surfaces where the Killing vectors ζH±
either of the four codimension one surfaces Hασ,

become null we have Killing horizons. Explicitly,

ασ, α = 1, 2, σ = +,−,
deﬁne a null surface along the corresponding null Killing vector [12].

Hασ :

r2 = r2

(2.18)

We will show below these are generically (not always) Killing horizons with a bifurcation curve
which we specify. Moreover, we argue that, when they exist, these Killing horizons are either
event horizon (outer horizon) or Cauchy horizon (inner horizon); if the event horizon is generated
by ζH±
. Then Hα± null surfaces for α = 1, 2 correspond to
two branches of the event horizon and vice-versa, and the inner and outer bifurcation curves are
H1± ∩ H2±, and are given by the equation r2 = r2

, the inner horizon is generated by ζH∓

1± = r2

2±.

To ensure existence of horizons and whether they are inner or outer horizon, we need to analyze
the signs, zeros and inﬁnities of r2
α± and |ζH±|2. We note that range of r coordinate can contain
r2 < 0 regions. Nonetheless, as discussed, to avoid CTC’s, r2 cannot be too negative. The
condition for existence of horizons cannot be met in all of the x± ∈ [0, 2π] region, we are forced
to cut some parts (due to CTC). Moreover, since in general ψ and φ have zeros, the horizon and
boundary regions are not simply connected and will generically have some disconnected patches.
Another point we will discuss below is that the allowed range for r2 gives a double cover of
spacetime. This latter may be seen very explicitly in the appendix for the BTZ case of constant,
positive L±. The analysis of causal structure will be quite diﬀerent for constant or nonconstant
cases and they need to be discussed separately.

Case I: constant L±. This case is the more studied and better understood case, e.g. see [12, 6]
and references therein. For the case where L± ≥ 0 we have BTZ black holes. This case will be
discussed in some detail in the Appendix. For the BTZ case, as is well-known [3], we generically
have a (bifurcate) simply connected horizon which is a circle.

Case II: generic L± case. Unlike Case I, in this case ψ and φ functions can have roots and
zeros. Here and below unless mentioned explicitly, we will be considering nonconstant generic L±
cases. Before starting the analysis, we note the facts that, as implied by (2.9) and (2.10),

• ψ1, ψ2 are smooth functions and can only have simple roots.

1, ψ′

2 are also smooth and can only have simple roots.

• ψ′
• Number of simple roots of ψ1 in x+ ∈ [0, 2π] is equal to the number of roots of ψ2 in the
2 have the same

same range. Let us denote this number by n+. One may show that ψ′
number of roots.

• Between any two root of ψ1 (ψ2), there is a root of ψ2 (ψ1), and similarly for their derivatives.
• If roots of ψ2, ψ′
4,i, i = 1,· · · , n+, we have
2,i < x+
1,i+1. Note that we are using normalization (2.10).

• Let us focus on the ith roots, i.e. the Ia,i, a = 1, 2, 3, 4 regions. One can always choose the

On the existence of horizons. The horizons, if exist, should be at the roots of |ζH±|2. To
distinguish which one is the inner horizon and which one the outer, we need to study the sign of
r2
α± functions. Given the above analysis on the roots and signs of ψ, φ’s, we learn that r2

How to build full 4n+ × 4n− tables. We note that, as discussed above, if in general functions
ψ and φ have respectively n+ and n− zeros, then the above tables, instead of being 5 × 5 should
have 4n+ × 4n− = 16n+n− regions. The way to build these bigger tables from those given here
is simply copying the above tables n− times on the rows, identifying the last and ﬁrst columns in
each copy; and copying n+ times the columns and then identifying the last and ﬁrst rows in each
copy.4 In the end, we should also identify the ﬁrst row and the last row, and the ﬁrst column and
the last column. This last identiﬁcation is to implement the 2π periodicity of Π and r2
α± functions.
We also note that the tables here are denoting x± ∈ [0, 2π]. These tables are hence, in fact,

depictions of the AdS3 boundary.

We stress that this equation is true for all four choices of roots of |ζH±|. However, to read the
physical surface gravity and determining its sign, we need to ﬁx the normalization of the Killing
vectors.

Fixing the normalization of Killings.
It is well known that in order to read the horizon
kinematical properties, like horizon angular velocity and surface gravity, one needs to choose an
appropriate normalization for the corresponding Killing vectors. In particular, we are interested
in ﬁnding the horizon properties associated with the outer horizon, the horizon causally connected
to the AdS3 boundary. The Killing vector generating this outer (event) horizon should remain

(which is at u = v = 0). In the usual terminology Σ+ is the bifurcation curve. Similarly to H1+
and H2+, Σ+ is not necessarily simply connected and may have some disconnected pieces. Below
we discuss some properties of the bifurcation curve Σ+:

1. The Killing vector ﬁeld which generates the horizon vanishes at Σ+. In the region we are

discussing the horizon is generated by ζH+

and

This may be checked by a straightforward computation at Σ+ = H1+ ∩ H2+. To this end, it
is useful to note that at Σ+:

a curve of ﬁnite length,

AH = 2πℓ(β+ + β−),

(2.35)

One may readily see that Σ− has the same “length” as above.

7. Bifurcation curve Σ has (n+ + 1)(n− + 1) disconnected pieces. The bifurcation curves
Σ+, as parametrized by Φ+ coordinate (2.32), consist of some disconnected pieces. To
distinguish the disconnected pieces, we should check where the equations deﬁning Σ+ (2.29)
have solutions and also where Φ is real-valued. Given the information in our tables, we
learn that Σ+ has the same number of disconnected pieces as the Hα+. Considering the
outer (event) horizons generated by ζH+
, the bifurcation curve of the event horizon has
(n+ + 1)(n− + 1) disconnected pieces.

Inner horizons. Associated with any event horizon there is, generically, an inner horizon. The
region “inside” the inner horizon region is bounded between the inner horizon (which is where we
have a null Killing vector ﬁeld) and the region we develop a CTC. Inside this region the horizon
generating Killing vector should remain time-like. When the event horizon is generated by ζH±
the inner (Cauchy) horizon is generated by ζH∓

Summary of subsection: We argued that the two Killing vectors ζH±
which are everywhere
orthogonal, can become null on some diﬀerent patches of spacetime. These null surfaces can
intersect the boundary in diﬀerent places. As discussed boundary and horizon, in general, have
(n++1)(n−+1) disconnected pieces. When the outer horizon is generated by ζH±
the corresponding
inner horizon is generated by ζH∓
. Regardless of which ζ producing the horizon, the coordinate
spanning the bifurcation curve of the event horizon is Φ+ and that of the inner horizon is Φ−.
The length of the event horizon is always 2πℓR+

H and that of inner horizon is 2πℓR−
H.

6Note that if the event horizon is generated by ζH

, one should revisit the deﬁnition of X ± (2.24), by taking
either of X − or X + to minus themselves. In this way the coordinate covering the event horizon will always keep
the form Φ+. As we will discuss, Φ− will be the coordinate on the inner horizon.

2.4 Geodesic motion on generic Ba˜nados geometries

To gain a better intuition about the Ba˜nados geometries we present a brief analysis of geodesic
motion on these backgrounds. Similar study has been performed for constant L± case, cases which
include BTZ black holes, in the literature. For clarity and completeness we have presented those
analysis in the Appendix. Here, we give a discussion for generic L± functions.

As discussed any Ba˜nados geometry generically has two global Killing vectors ζ± and four local
ones, altogether we have six Killing vectors which form sl(2, R) × sl(2, R) algebra. We may use
these facts to construct the geodesics. Let us consider the geodesic velocity vector vµ = dxµ/ds,
where s is the aﬃne parameter on the geodesic. The velocity along Killing vectors is a constant
of motion. Therefore, P±,

are constants of motion. Having two constants of motion, we can completely solve for the velocity
vector using the fact that

P± = v · ζH±

,

(2.36)

v2 = σ,

σ = −1, 0, +1 resepctively for time-like, null and space-like geodesics.

(2.37)

To write out the above equation explicitly, let us deﬁne an orthogonal basis, ζH±

and η, with

(2.38)

What will be important in our further discussions in sections 4 and 5 is that Z 2, P± are diﬀeomor-
phism invariant quantities. Therefore, geodesic observers can only probe a part of the information
encoded in the functions L± which specify the geometric properties of the background.

2.5 Summary of Ba˜nados geometries and outlook of the section

We argued that in general, irrespective of the details of functions L±, Ba˜nados metrics (2.2) have
U(1)+ × U(1)− global isometries. The corresponding Killing vectors may be constructed through
the solutions to the Hill’s equations (2.9), ψ and φ functions. In general, for nonconstant L± cases,
can vanish at four surfaces given in (2.15). As discussed two
norm of Killing vector ﬁelds ζH±
of these four surfaces provide outer (event) bifurcate horizon while the other two, the bifurcate
inner Killing horizon. The Ba˜nados coordinate system, once the range r2 < 0 is also included,
covers the regions outside the outer horizon (all the way to the boundary) and the inside the inner
horizon (all the way to the CTC region). It does not necessarily cover the (whole) region between
the two horizons. Moreover, as discussed, in the allowed region for r2, it provides a double cover
of the part of spacetime in covers.

As discussed in some detail, in the x± ∈ [0, 2π] range horizons intersect the boundary in
(n+ + 1)(n− + 1) distinct regions, where n+, n− are respectively number of zeros of ψ and φ
functions. Moreover, we showed that the inner and outer bifurcation curves Σ± also have the
same number of disconnected pieces. The surface gravity κ, angular velocity ΩH and length AH
of the outer horizon is given in terms of the Floquet indices of the ψ and φ solutions, β±, as

(2.43)

There is a closely related construction for multi-BTZ geometries due to Brill [16]. This con-
struction is based on the fact that constant time slice for AdS3 has the line element ds2 =
(dz2 + dx2)/z2 which is nothing but a 2d hyperboloid H 2. The latter may also be viewed as
the Poincar´e disk. It is well known that one may construct all 2d surfaces of genus g ≥ 2 from
orbifolds of H 2, by making identiﬁcations on it with a discrete subgroup of its sl(2, R) isometry.
It is then argued that if we add back the time direction, the 3d geometry we obtain in this way
is a black hole geometry with multi-sector horizon and boundary. In a diﬀerent terminology, one
may cut through the maximally extended multi-BTZ geometry at the constant time slice passing
through the horizon. In this way, one observes that the multi-BTZ geometry is indeed a wormhole
with g number of handles [17, 18].

One may also try to draw causal diagram (Penrose diagram) of the Ba˜nados geometries of
generic n±. In drawing the Penrose diagram we usually suppress a spacelike compact direction
(here the one along Φ+ or Φ− coordinates). Our discussions in this section reveals that the Penrose
diagrams for generic n± are essentially the same as those of usual BTZ geometries discussed in
[3]. The only diﬀerence is that we need to repeat the same structure of horizons (n+ + 1)(n− + 1)
times in the vertical column. Since it is not going to be more illuminating we will not show the
explicit ﬁgure here.

In the “Brill’s diagrams” [16], the construction is based upon time-direction suppressed 3d
geometry. In our tables, we discuss the x± while suppressing radial direction r and in Penrose
diagram we are suppressing the “compact Φ” direction. In a sense these three are complementary
to each other. Making a thorough comparison and working out the details of connection between
our multi-sector geometries and those of Brill is postponed to upcoming works.

3 Ba˜nados geometries and the associated conserved charges

As was discussed in [6], to a given Ba˜nados geometry one may associate two kind of charges,
the Virasoro charges and charges associated to Killing vectors ζ±. It was shown in [6] that the
usual Lee-Wald [19] or Barnich-Brandt [20] symplectic structure vanishes on-shell for Ba˜nados
geometries and hence within the covariant phase space method (see e.g. [7] for a review) one can
deﬁne symplectic symmetries. That is, the surface charges could be deﬁned by integration on a
space-like one-dimensional curve everywhere in the geometry and not necessarily at the boundary.

It was argued in [7] that sympelctic symmetries as deﬁned above, may be in either of the two
groups: The generator of the symmetry could be an exact symmetry, in our setting a Killing
vector, or it can be a nontrivial diﬀeomorphism which is not an exact symmetry. The former
may hence be called “Symplectic Exact Symmetry” (SES) and the latter “Symplectic Non-exact
Symmetry” (SNS). In our example the SNS are generated by diﬀeomorphisms along the χ vector
ﬁeld (2.5) and the SES are generated by the Killings ζ± (2.7) [6].

In this section we give the expression for charges associated with SNS and SES. The ﬁrst part
of this section is essentially a review of [6]. However, the second part is a completion of [6] along
the analysis of [7].

3.1 Charges associated with Symplectic Non-exact Symmetries (SNS)

In the covariant phase space method, we ﬁrst deﬁne charge variations associated with ﬁeld varia-
tions/perturbations generated by a vector ﬁeld, e.g. χ, and then integrate these charge variations
over a given path in the phase space to deﬁne the charge itself. The integrability condition,
which is checked to hold in our case [6], then guarantees that the charges do not depend on the
integration path in the phase space.

For the Ba˜nados geometry with L± functions, if we denote the charges associated with χ[ǫ+ =
einx+, ǫ− = 0] and χ[ǫ+ = 0, ǫ− = einx−] (cf. (2.5)) respectively by Ln, ¯Ln, their explicit form is [6]

Ln[g] =

ℓ

8πGI dx+L+(x+)einx+

,

¯Ln[g] =

ℓ

8πGI dx−L−(x−)einx−

.

(3.1)

These charges form two Virasoro algebras at the Brown-Henneaux central charge:

[Ln, Lm] = (n − m)Ln+m +

[Ln, ¯Lm] = 0,

(3.2)

(3.3)

where G is the 3d Newton constant. Note that unlike the usual Brown-Henneaux case [4], (1) our
charges are deﬁned everywhere and not just close to the boundary; (2) the charges are deﬁned
around an arbitrary Ba˜nados solution and not just AdS3 (in Poincar´e patch). This latter brings two
interesting features: ﬁrst, the charges are associated with each Ba˜nados geometry and second, the
charges become ﬁeld dependent, their expression explicitly depends on the background functions
L±. Therefore, to obtain the algebra of charges one needs to consider an “adjusted bracket” which

16

includes the change made the background functions when computing charge variations; see [6] for
detailed discussions and analysis.

3.2 Charges associated with Symplectic Exact Symmetries (SES)

In [6] (see [7] as well) it has been argued that one can associate following conserved charges to
U(1)± Killing vectors of the geometry (2.2)

and

δL± =

∂L±
∂β±

δβ±.

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

The numeric coeﬃcients 2β± in (3.5) is twice the Floquet index (2.11) and has been added recalling
the discussions around (2.24) in section 2.3.2.

Using (2.9) and (2.10) we learn that

K0

+δL+ = 2β+ (ψ2δψ′′

2 δψ1) = 2β+ (ψ2δψ′

1 − ψ′′

1 − ψ′

2δψ1)′ ,

(3.7)

and similarly for the right-movers (the case labelled by minus index). In the above prime denotes
derivative w.r.t. the argument x± and δ denotes variations w.r.t. the Floquet index β±. Therefore,

δJ+ =

δJ− =

(3.8)

One may now use the Floquet form (2.11) and the normalization condition (2.10) to further
simplify the above:

1 − ψ′

2δψ1(cid:3)2π

To get the charges J± we need to integrate over δJ± on path in the β± space, i.e.

where β±0 is a reference point which has zero J±. As we will discuss in the next section two
standard choices are β2
±0 = 0 when
the reference point is chosen as AdS3 in Poincar´e patch (massless BTZ).

±0 = −1/4 (when J± are measured w.r.t. global AdS3) or β2

The very important point discussed in [6] is that the J± charges above commute with the

Virasoro generators Ln, ¯Ln,

[J±, Ln] = [J±, ¯Ln] = 0,

∀n ∈ Z.

(3.11)

Also, in this case the normalization factor 2β± is the inverse of the temperature in the left and
right moving sectors, τ± = 1/(2β±).

3.3 Entropy, the ﬁrst law and Smarr relation for Ba˜nados geometries

As in the standard Wald formulation [21] the charge associated with the outer (event) Killing
horizon is S/2π where S is the black hole entropy. In our case the charge associated with the
Killing horizon generating vector ﬁelds ζH±

is [6]

δS

Using the discussions of the previous subsection we learn that:

τ± =

.

(3.12)

(3.13)

Note that δ in the above denotes variation in the Floquet indices β±. Here τ± is the inverse
temperature associated with the left and right sectors. The above is nothing but the ﬁrst law for a
generic Ba˜nados geometry. One can integrate (3.12) in the parameter space, over β± parameters,
to obtain the Smarr relation for Ba˜nados geometries

One may also compute the conserved charge associated with the inner horizon generating Killing

This conserved charge may be written in terms of the other two conserved charges J±. In particular

4 Virasoro coadjoint orbits and their associated geometries

It is well known that Virasoro algebra

[Ln, Lm] = (n − m)Ln+m +

c
12

n(n2 − 1)δn+m,

(4.1)

is associated with the algebra of inﬁnitesimal diﬀermorphisms on a circle, dif f (S1). That is,

x → x + ξ(x),

ξ(x + 2π) = ξ(x),

(4.2)

where [ξ(x)∂x, ρ(x)∂x] produces the Witt algebra, the Virasoro algebra without the central term.
The Virasoro group, on the other hand, is associated with ﬁnite orientation-preserving coordinate
transformations on the circle Dif f (S1) which is generated through

x → h(x),

h(x + 2π) = h(x) + 2π,

h′ > 0.

(4.3)

Being inﬁnite dimensional, representations of the Virasoro group, the corresponding “Virasoro
multiplets”, are also inﬁnite dimensional. These representations are usually called Virasoro coad-
joint orbits. The elements in the Virasoro orbits are of course speciﬁed by periodic functions on
the circle. However, given an arbitrary function f (x) on S1 there are elements in Dif f (S1) under
which f does not change. One may then use this fact to distinguish functions (elements) which
belong to the same or diﬀerent orbits. Explicitly, let us recall that from the form of algebra (4.1)
under the transformation (4.2),

δξf = ξ′′′ − 4f ξ′ − 2f ′ξ,

(4.4)

where the third order derivative appears due to the presence of the central term. 8 Therefore, all
the functions in the same orbit are generated by the solutions to δξf = 0, the stabilizer equation
[10, 22]:

The orbits associated with function f (x), Of are then [10, 22, 23]

ξ′′′ − 4f ξ′ − 2f ′ξ = 0.

Of = Dif f (S1)/Tξ[f ],

(4.5)

(4.6)

where Tξ[f ] is the subgroup of Dif f (S1) generated through the periodic solution(s) to stabilizer
equation (4.5); note that only periodic ξ(x) can be “exponentiated” to give an element of the Vi-
rasoro group. So, the problem of classiﬁcation of Virasoro coadjoint orbits reduces to classifying
periodic solutions of the stabilizer equation (4.5). This classiﬁcation is well established and stan-
dard references on the topic are [10, 22, 23], however, we will use the method based on SL(2, R)
monodromy discussed in [11] and follow its notations.

Before moving further, we make the ﬁrst remarkable correspondence between the analysis of
orbits and the Ba˜nados geometries: the stabilizer equation (4.5) is exactly the same equation which
appeared in the analysis of Killing vectors of Ba˜nados metrics and the group Tξ[f ] is nothing but
the group of global isometries of Ba˜nados metrics with a given f .

8As is implied by the AdS/CFT correspondence the δξf is how the energy momentum tensor of a 2d CFT, f ,

transforms under conformal transformations.

19

The rest of the analysis of solutions to (4.5) goes as discussed in the previous section, through

the Hill’s equation

(4.7)
where x ∈ [0, 2π] parametrize a circle of unit radius. It is straightforward to check that upon
the coordinate transformation in Virasoro group (4.3), the pair (ψ(x), f (x)) in (4.7) transform to
( ˜ψ(x), ˜f (x)) where [11]

f (x + 2π) = f (x) ,

ψ′′ − f (x)ψ = 0,

f (x) → ˜f (x) = h′2 (f (h(x)) − S(h; x)) ,

ψ → ˜ψ(x) =

where S(h; x) is the Schwartz derivative

ψ(h(x)) ,

S(h; x) =

h′′′
2h′3 −

3h′′2
4h′4 .

(4.8)

(4.9)

Each coadjoint orbit will hence be speciﬁed by a “representative character f (x),” the ψ and the
corresponding “conformal descendents” (constructed through (4.8)). The “little group” Tξ[f ] by
which we mod out the Dif f (S1), is generically generated by ψ1ψ2, where ψi are the two linearly
independent solutions to Hill’s equation (4.7) in the Floquet form (2.11). However, in special case
of f = −n2/4, n ∈ Z Hill’s equation has three periodic solutions (with 2π/n periodicity). In these
cases Tξ[f ] is n-fold cover of P LS(2, R), P LS(n)(2, R) [11].9

As reviwed in [11], one can recognize two general class of such coadjoint orbits: those with a

constant representative and the other with x-dependent representative.

4.1 Constant representative coadjoint orbits

There are four class of such orbits:

• Exceptional orbits En, with representative:

Some comments about constant representative orbits are in order:

(4.13)

(4.14)

1. For all of the above orbits the Floquet index is either a real number (for hyperbolic orbits

B0(b)) or a pure imaginary number for exceptional or elliptic orbits Cν.

2. The exceptional case En is special as it has two Floquet forms, as written in (4.10) and

(4.11). The Floquet index in these two cases is either zero or in.

3. The parabolic case is also special in the sense that the corresponding ψ’s are not in strict
Floquet form, the ψ1 is “quasi-periodic”, ψ1(x + 4π) = ψ1(x) + 2ψ2(x). The generator of
“periodic” Killing is ψ2

2 (instead of ψ1ψ2).

4. The b = 0 hyperbolic orbit overlaps with the n = 0 exceptional orbit and both have f = 0.

However, this is still diﬀerent from the parabolic orbit P +

0 which again has f = 0.

5. Note that the above functions are for the “representative” of the orbit. A generic element
in the orbit may be constructed from these upon the action (4.8) with (4.3). For generic
element in the orbit, hence, the function f is not a constant.

4.2 Non-constant representative coadjoint orbits

There are two such orbits, parabolic ones P ±

n and hyperbolic ones Bn(b):

• Parabolic orbits P ±

As one can explicitly see, ψ’s are not in standard Floquet form, and as the parabolic orbit

ψ1(x + 4π) = ψ1(x) ± 2ψ2(x).

ψn=1,b/n(nx).

(4.19)

Moreover, one may check that fn,b + n2/4 is not a positive deﬁnite function.

Some comments and points about the nonconstant representatives are in order:

1. The n = 0 hyperbolic and parabolic orbits cannot be obtained from the above nonconstant

representative orbits by setting n = 0.

2. The character function fn of the above orbits is a function with 2π/n periodicity.

3. The function fn for nonconstant representatives can become negative. Integral of fn + 1/4
which is often called “energy” [11] has a negative value, except for the P −
1 orbit. For
hyperbolic orbits this “energy” is unbounded from below (as a fucntions of b). One may show
that this “energy” does not have deﬁnite sign either, for the descendents of the representative.

4. As the equations above indicate, the representative element of n > 1 orbits may be expressed
through n = 1 ones though with replacing x with nx. In particular, for the hyperbolic ones
one should also replace b parameter with b/n.

5. A generic element in these orbits can be obtained from the above “representatives” upon
the action (4.8) with (4.3). For generic element of the orbit then the character function f
or ψ’s are just 4π periodic (and not 4π/n).

6. One may readily see that the hyperbolic orbits Bn(b) and the exceptional orbits En overlap

at b = 0.

7. n is in fact determining the number of zeros of ψ functions in [0, 2π] range.

22

4.3 Orbit invariant quantities

As discussed, a Virasoro coadjoint orbit is speciﬁed by a representative function and a character,
ψ, f , and then elements in the orbit, the descendents, are constructed from this upon the action
(4.8). So, each orbit consists of inﬁnitely many (countable though, because h(x) is a periodic
function) functions/states. Since we build the orbit from the representative, one would expect
that the parameters specifying the representative functions should be readable from any element
in the orbit (and not just the representative of the orbit). Explicitly, there should be some “orbit
invariant” charges and quantities.

In section 3, we have in fact laid the basic ground for specifying these charges and quantities:
any element in an orbit is speciﬁed by two kind of charges: the Virasoro charges (speciﬁed by
combination of Virasoro generators Ln’s, Π{nk}L−nk) and the J charges, which specify the rep-
resentative. These two charges commute with each other. Our construction of the J charges in
section 3.2 makes it explicit that this charge is an orbit invariant quantity.

Now that we have discussed the orbit classiﬁcation, we can be more explicit about these charges.
As we see in general any orbit is speciﬁed by a discrete integer label n and/or a continuous label
b (for hyperbolic orbits) and ν (for elliptic orbits). By construction, the charge J can only be
associated with the continuous label on the orbit. The reason is that the method discussed in
[7], which reviewed and used in section 3.2, is suited for computing charge variations within a
given class of solutions with exact symmetry. This means that within a class of given orbits,
e.g. the hyperbolic orbit with a given n, the orbits may be uniquely speciﬁed by the continuous
label. This continuous parameter is related to the conserved charge J, as given in (3.9). We note
that the parameter β which speciﬁes the charge J is the Floquet index deﬁned as exp(4πβ) =
ψ1(x + 4π)/ψ1(x). With this deﬁnition, and recalling (4.8), one immediately sees that β is orbit
invariant, because

e4πβ =

˜ψ(x + 4π)

˜ψ(x)

ψ(h(x + 4π))/√h′

ψ(h(x))/√h′

=

=

ψ(x + 4π)

ψ(x)

.

(4.20)

The discrete label on the orbits is also an orbit invariant quantity. This index is given by the
number of zeros of ψ1 or ψ2 functions in the [0, 2π] range. To see the orbit invariance of this label,
we recall (4.8) which states that the ψ function of any two states in the same orbit are related to
the representative element as

˜ψ(x) =

ψ(h(x)),

h(x + 2π) = h(x) + 2π,

h′ > 0.

(4.21)

1

ph(x)

The above clearly shows that number of zeros of ˜ψ and ψ are the same. We note that the X ±
coordinate deﬁne in (2.24) are also orbit invariant.

Unlike the continuous label, the Floquet index, there is no “Noether-type” conserved charges
associated with the discrete label n. There are however, topological charges (invariants) related
to it.

23

4.4 Ba˜nados geometries/Virasoro orbits correspondence

With the discussions and analysis of earlier sections, we are now ready to match the Virasoro orbits
on the left and right sectors and the Ba˜nados geometries. A discussion on this was presented in
section 4 of [6] our main addition to that list is the cases involving generic hyperbolic orbits.10
In general, depending on L+ and L− functions the Ba˜nados geometry will be in O+ ⊗ O− orbit,
where O± denote the orbits associated with left and right sectors. Here we will mainly consider
cases where the left and right sectors are both from the same class of orbits. Some of the “mixed
cases” has been discussed in the Appendix.

We note that geometries in the same orbits, the descendents, are related to each other by a
speciﬁc class of diﬀeomorphisms generated by vector ﬁeld χ (2.5). Therefore, the geometries in
the same orbit, besides the orbit invariant quantities we discussed in previous subsection, share
the same causal, boundary and horizon structure and have the same geodesics distances between
any two point in the geometries in the same orbit.

Constant representative cases

• En+⊗En− orbits. These are geometries which are descendents of n±-fold covers of AdS3 with
P LS(n+)(2, R)×P LS(n−)(2, R) isometry. We note that this is the symmetry (isometry) group
of the representative of the orbit and the “descendents” generically have only U(1)+× U(1)−
global isometry. Note that while the representatives have L± = −n2
±/4, geometries in this
family do not generically have a constant character function L±. Geometries in this orbit
are horizon-free and their global and boundary structure is like N-fold cover of AdS3 (see
the Appendix for more details). The global AdS3 is the representative element of the n± = 1
orbit.

• C(ν+) ⊗ C(ν−) orbits include geometries which are descendents of particles of given mass
and angular momentum on the N-fold covers of AdS3 (see the Appendix). These geometries
do not have horizon and are not black holes.

• B0(b+) ⊗ B0(b−) orbits. These geometries include BTZ black holes and their (conformal)
descendents. We stress that all the geometries in this class (with a given b±) have the same
J± charges. Unlike the usual lore, as we have discussed the correct charge assignment to
these geometries is J± with the “energy” in the left and right sectors and not L0 and ¯L0. As
reviewed in the Appendix, the geometry corresponding to the representative of the orbit, has
constant, positive L±, is the usual BTZ geometry. The other geometries descending from
this constant L ones, are uniquely speciﬁed by their Virasoro charges, “Virasoro hairs”, while
sharing the same causal, boundary and horizon, structure as their BTZ parent geometry. All
these geometries have the same horizon area, surface gravity and horizon angular velocity.
In this sense they may be viewed as “microstates” of the representative element, which is a
BTZ black hole.

10Similar analysis and the geometric picture associated with the BMS group has also been discussed in some

papers, e.g. [24].

24

• P +

0 ⊗ P +
0 orbit. The representative of this orbit corresponds to null-selfdual AdS3 orbifold
[25] and the other states in this orbit have J± = 0. This geometries may be obtained in the
near horizon limit of geometry in the orbit of massless BTZ black holes [26]. The global
isometry group in this class is SL(2, R)× SL(2, R), where the two U(1) factors in SL(2, R)’s
can be noncompact.

• P +

0 ⊗ B0(b) orbits. The representative of these geometries is AdS3 selfdual orbifold [27]. Ge-
ometries in this class of orbits are not black holes (do not have event horizon). Nonetheless,
they may be obtained as the near horizon limit of extremal BTZ [6, 28]. The geometries
in this class have four global Killing vectors, forming an SL(2, R) × U(1) isometry group.
Nonetheless, the U(1) ∈ SL(2, R) is noncompact [6].11
0 ⊗ C(ν) orbits with 0 < ν < 1. These orbits show “chiral particles” (those with equal
mass and angular momentum) on AdS3 and their descendents.

• P +

Geometry of hyperbolic orbits, Bn+(b+) ⊗ Bn−(b−). As it stems from the discussions of
section 3, these are geometries which in general have inner and outer horizons and their boundary
has some disconnected pieces. As a general, but rough, picture one may consider an N-fold cover
of AdS3 and perform the same construction of BTZ black holes [3] on each patch of this N-fold
cover, such that all the geometries have the same horizon temperatures τ±. The horizon and
boundary contains an N-fold copy and when one starts from a given patch on the boundary, s/he
can only access a speciﬁc patch of the horizon (and the geometry). This is the picture we have for
multi-BTZ black holes in Brill’s construction [16]. In the Euclidean version the boundary is a 2d
surface with (n+ + 1)(n− + 1)-handles. Irrespective of which patch at the boundary we look into
the bulk, one would see exactly the same geometry, with the same mass and angular momentum.

As we discussed, one can associate positive, deﬁnite charges J± to these geometries, while the
integral of the character fn,b (which has been called “energy” in the literature, e.g. see [11]) is
not necessarily positive, deﬁnite. We also note that for these orbits generic n and n = 1 cases
are related as (4.19). This, together with the relation for the entropy (3.14), may suggest that
diﬀerent patches of the horizon, while at the same temperature, carry an equal portion of the
entropy, and that each patch has its own “ﬁrst law” (3.13).

5 Concluding remarks and outlook

In this work we elaborated further on the Ba˜nados geometries. This work was a continuation of
[12] and [6]. Below we provide a quick summary and a general picture arising from our analysis.

1. Diﬀerent probes can access diﬀerent kind of information from the geometry. The “classical”
probes, like geodesics, have only access to “classical, geometric” information. These geo-
metric information are “orbit invariant” and include geodesic distances, charges associated

11We comment that geometries in the E1⊗B0(b) orbits, too, have four global Killings forming an SL(2, R)×U (1)

isometry group, where the two U (1)’s here are compact. These geometries are not black holes either.

25

with the exact Killing symmetries J±, causal and boundary structure. Classical observers
are blind to Virasoro charges, “Virasoro hair”.

2. The Virasoro charges are semi-classical ones, they are given by “surface integrals,” integrals
over codimension two spacelike curves (that is, integrals over one-dimensional curves in our
3d case). This information is not available to local classical probes.

3. There is a one-to-one relation between two copies of Virasoro coadjoint orbits and Ba˜nados
geometries, which are speciﬁed by two general holomorphic functions. All geometries in the
same orbit share the same “geometric” information, while they can be distinguished by their
“Virasoro hairs”. The geometric information are orbit invariant.

4. It is possible that at the level of the geometry we have extra requirements like absence of

CTCs, which needs to be considered.

5. Both the charges associated with exact symmetries J± and the Virasoro hairs are “symplectic
charges” [6, 7]. That is, these charges may be deﬁned by integration over any spacelike
compact curve in the 3d spacetime; this curve need not be at the boundary of the space or
at its horizon.

6. Our analysis suggests the following general picture: diﬀerent geometries which are diﬀeo-
morphic to each other share the same “geometric information”. This is what we learn in
the standard GR courses. However, there could be a measure-zero set of diﬀeomorphisms
producing semi-classically diﬀerent geometries, they may be distinguished by their other
surface charges, “semi-classical hairs”. The states sharing the same classical geometric in-
formation fall into orbits of the semi-classical symmetry algebra. This symmetry algebra is a
symplectic symmetry of the phase space constituted from diﬀeomorphic but distinguishable,
geometries. If the geometry we are dealing with is a black hole, then the geometries which
share the same geometric information may be viewed as “hairs” on this black hole. This,
we hope, provides a handle on the black hole microstate problem. We have established this
picture for AdS3 case. Similar ideas have been worked through for near horizon extremal
geometries [29]. We think this picture should be more general and applicable to any black
hole. This picture ﬁts well with the recent ideas and analysis [30]. We hope to provide
further evidence for this picture in more general settings.

7. Although we worked in a speciﬁc gauge, the Ba˜nados coordinate system, we believe the
above picture is gauge independent. First explicit steps in this direction was taken in [6],
where it was shown that similar results hold in the Gaussian null cordinates (also known as
the BMS gauge).

8. At a perhaps more technical level, Ba˜nados geometries form a phase space. Elements in this
phase space are classiﬁed by the Virasoro coadjoint orbits. One may hence use this picture
to perform quantization of AdS3 gravity. We hope this viewpoint can shed further light on
the question of AdS3 gravity quantization, e.g. see [31, 32] and references therein.

A More on constant representative orbits and their geometries

In this appendix we give more detailed discussions and computations on the constant L± geome-
tries and the associated orbits. This class includes BTZ black holes and conic spaces (particles on
AdS3).

A.1 More on geometry of constant L± cases

We discussed in section 4, there are four class of solutions to the Hill’s equation with a constant
representative which are elliptic orbits, exceptional orbits and zeroth of parabolic and hyperbolic
orbits. This gives totally 10 classes of geometry solutions. Four of them are correspond to the left
and right sector are in the same monodromy class and other corresponding to the mixed orbits.
The number of global Killing vector can be two, four or six. Two general Killing vectors are ∂+
and ∂−. Assuming two linearly independent combinations of these two Killing vectors denotes by
ζ± = ∂+ ± k∂− (with a real non-zero k). The norm of these vectors is given by
ζ+ · ζ− = ℓ2(L+ − k2L−) .

(r2 ∓ ℓ2kL−)(kr2 ∓ ℓ2L+)

|ζ±|2 = ∓

(A.1)

r2

,

Depending on the relative signs of L+ and L−, one can distinguish diﬀerent possibilities. When
L+ and L− have opposite signs, the inner product does not vanish anywhere, while |ζ±| vanish at
points, r2 = ± ℓ2L+
k , r2 = ±kℓ2L−. When they have similar relative sign, we may take k2 = L+

ζ+ · ζ− = 0,

therefore r2 = ±ℓ2√L+L− is potentially the position of the bifurcate horizon.

When L± are constant, we can use the coordinate transformation

In this coordinate system, (A.2) takes the form

|ζ±|2 = ∓(cid:18) ρ+ + ρ−

(A.5)

(A.6)

(A.7)

As we see for generic L± with arbitrary signs, ρ± need not be real-valued, and we hence need to
consider the three cases of L± > 0, L± < 0 and L+L− < 0 separately.

L+, L− > 0, the BTZ case.
In this case both ρ± are real-valued and are denoting the horizon
radii. As (A.6) shows, ρ+ (ρ−) is the radius of the outer (inner) horizons. The event horizon is
generated by ζH, where

The surface gravity is given by

ζH = ∂t + Ω∂ϕ,

Ω =

To avoid the CTC we need to limit ρ2 to ρ2 > 0 region.

The conserved charges J± are related to mass and angular momentum of BTZ black hole as in
(3.11). In this case the appropriate choice for β±0 is zero, so that the massless BTZ has vanishing
mass and angular momentum.

L+, L− < 0, the conic spaces.
± are negative and hence there are no Killing
horizons (|ζ±| = 0) in the region which there are no CTC. These geometries are hence horizon-free
and are not black holes. These correspond to particles on AdS3 (the spaces with conical defects)
[2]. These particles are speciﬁed by mass M and angular momentum J,

In this case ρ2

To write out metric explicitly, we may introduce ˜ρ2

form as (A.4) with

To avoid the existence of CTC we must restrict ourselves to ρ2 > 0 region which is corresponding
to

r2 > 0,

r2 /∈ (ℓ2|L−|, ℓ2|L+|) .

(A.10)

L+L− < 0, the mixed case. Without loss of generality we may choose L+ > 0, L− < 0. In this
case ρ± turn out to be complex conjugate of each others and metric is given by (A.4) with

solve ˙y±.

Null geodesies. Combining (A.14) and (A.13) for the null geodesy give us ¨ρ = 0, which gives

Null and time-like geodesies of BTZ black holes

Next let us consider a BTZ black hole, i.e constant non-zero L±s. Noting that in this case we have
only two global Killing vectors ∂±. Using the fact that K.v = const. where K is a Killing vector
and v is the velocity vector we get following equations

r4 + ℓ2L+L−

(A.20)

Therefore we can read ˙r for the null and time like geodesies.

A.2 More on geometries of constant representative orbits

As discussed in section 4 Ba˜nados geometries can be put in one-to-one relation with Virasoro
coadjoint orbits on the left and right sectors. Here we discuss geometries corresponding to orbits
of constant representative in more details.

Similar constant orbits. As we discussed geometric properties, such as horizon and causal
structure of all the solutions in the same orbit are the same. We will hence only focus on geometry
of the representative element of the orbit.

• En+ ⊗ En− orbits: In this case the representative element has L± = − n2
4 with integer n±.
n+ = n− = 1 corresponds to the global AdS3 geometry. For general n± once again we get
6 global Killing vectors. However the periodicities of Killing vectors are 2π
If we scale
n±
coordinates with the least common multiple of n+ and n− as follows

.

±

r → Nr,

x± → N −1x±,

N = lcm(n+, n−),

(A.21)

the metric turns out to be

(A.22)

where ν± = n±
N .

30

When n+ = n− = N, ν± = 1 and we get n-fold cover of AdS3. Explicitly if we perform
coordinate transformation (A.3), we arrive at the following metric

ds2 = −

ρ2 + ℓ2

ℓ2

dt2 + ℓ2 dρ2

ρ2 + ℓ2 + ρ2dϕ2,

ϕ ∈ [0, 2πN] .

(A.23)

For general n+ 6= n− it is clear that ν± < 1, and the metric is like (A.4) with (A.5),

ρ2
± = −

ℓ2
4

(ν+ ± ν−)2, ϕ ∈ [0, 2πN] .

(A.24)

This metric is representing particles on N-fold cover of AdS3, see below.
• C(ν+) ⊗ C(ν−) orbits: When L± = − ν 2
4 are negative constants with non-integer ν, the
corresponding geometry is a particle in AdS3, if ν± < 1. As discussed in appendix A.1
geometry does not have event horizon.

±

When one or both of ν± are larger than one, we can rewrite the metric as described for
En+ ⊗ En− case above, with

ρ2

(˜ν+ ± ˜ν−)2,

˜ν± =

N = lcm([ν−], [ν+]) .

(A.25)

As we see ˜ν± < 1.

• P +

• B0(b+) ⊗ B0(b−) orbits: When both of L± are constant positive (L± = b2

± > 0) the
corresponding geometry is a BTZ black hole. This solutions is discussed in appendix A.1 in
details.
0 ⊗ P +
0 orbits: The zeroth order of the parabolic orbit has L = 0. This can also happen
in the constant hyperbolic orbits with zero character. The corresponding geometry with
L± = 0 in the parabolic sector is the null self-dual orbifold [25]. The solution is identical
to the near horizon limit of massless BTZ black hole solution [26]. One should note that
solutions to the Hill’s equation in this case do not have the Floquet form and to construct
the global Killing vectors we use only the constant solution. We comment that for the cases
with parabolic orbit P +
0 we have the possibility of having one or three global Killing vectors
for each left or right sector. When we have three Killing vectors U(1) ∈ SL(2, R) isometry
is not compact.

Mixed constant orbits. There are six possible combination of the left and right sectors with
diﬀerent constant orbits.

• En ⊗ P +

0 orbits: The geometry admits four Killing vectors with periodic generators. The
geometry associated with the representative of the orbit in this case has the form (A.4) with

F (ρ) =

(ρ2 + ℓ2)2

ℓ2ρ2

, N ϕ =

ℓ
ρ2 , ϕ ∈ [0, 2πn] .

(A.26)

• B0(b) ⊗ C(ν) orbits: The corresponding geometry admits only two Killing vectors ∂+ and

∂−.The metric of the representative element takes general form (A.4) with (A.11).

• B0(b) ⊗ En orbits: This geometry has four periodic Killing vectors, three of them with
n . The metric for the representative element takes general form (A.4) with (A.11)

period 2π
with now L+ = b2, L− = −n2/4.

• B0(b)⊗ P +

0 orbits: In this case the metric of the representative corresponds to the self dual
orbifold of AdS3 [27]. A generic element in this orbit can be obtained as the near horizon
limit of geometry corresponding to B0(b) ⊗ B0(b), extremal BTZ black hole orbit [28].

• C(ν) ⊗ En orbits: The corresponding geometry admits four Killing vectors, three of them
n . The geometries correspond to chiral particles (those with equal mass and

have period 2π
spin) on N-fold (N = lcm(n, [ν]) cover of AdS3.

• C(ν) ⊗ P +

Poincar´e patch.

0 orbits: The representative geometry corresponds to chiral particle on AdS3 in
