Abstract

We consider how QCD axions produced by the misalignment mechanism could form galactic dark matter halos. We
recall that stationary, gravitationally stable axion ﬁeld conﬁgurations have the size of an asteroid with masses of
order 10−13M(cid:12) (because gradient pressure is insuﬃcient to support a larger object). We call such ﬁeld conﬁgurations
“drops”. We explore whether rotating drops could be larger, and ﬁnd that their mass could increase by a factor
∼ 10. Remarkably this mass is comparable to the mass of miniclusters generated from misalignment axions in the
scenario where the axion is born after inﬂation. We speculate that misalignment axions today are in the form of
drops, contributing to dark matter like a distribution of asteroids (and not as a coherent oscillating background
ﬁeld). We consider some observational signatures of the drops, which seem consistent with a galactic halo made of
axion dark matter.

Introduction

The QCD axion [1, 2] is a motivated, minimal and very curious dark matter candidate. It originally appeared [3]
in Peccei and Quinn’s solution to the strong CP problem [4], as the pseudo-goldstone boson of a global, anomalous
UPQ(1) symmetry. In “invisible” axion models [5, 6] which agree with observations, heavy new scalars and/or fermions
are introduced, and the UPQ(1) is spontaneously broken at a high scale fPQ ∼ 109 → 1011 GeV, so that the only
new particle at accessible energies is the light, feebly-coupled axion. And despite that the axion and neutrino have
comparable masses, the axion is a cold dark matter candidate, due to its non-thermal production in cosmology.

There are two production mechanisms for axion cold dark matter, in the case where the Peccei-Quinn phase
transition occurs after inﬂation. Both occur around the QCD phase transition, when the axion mass turns on. The
“misalignment mechanism” [7, 8], produces an oscillating classical axion ﬁeld, and the decay of the string network
produces a distribution of cold axion modes. The classical ﬁeld, produced by the misalignment mechanism, will be
called “the axion ﬁeld” in the following. This may be what some authors refer to as a Bose Einstein Condensate, how-
ever, the literature is confusing because other authors discuss whether the misalignment axions could “gravitationally
thermalise”, as a prerequisite to forming a Bose Einstein Condensate.

In this paper, we focus on the axion ﬁeld, despite that most axion dark matter may be produced by strings [9, 10].
As pointed out by Sikivie [11], dark matter composed of an axion ﬁeld is diﬀerent from WIMPs. The T ij elements
(pressures) of the stress-energy tensor are diﬀerent, and the axion ﬁeld is single-valued, whereas WIMPs are described
by a phase space distribution. The diﬀerence is intuitive and clear during late-time structure formation: particles
(described by phase space) fall into a gravitational well, rise up the other side, fall back, and so on. Indeed the whole
population of particles does this simultaneously, interacting only via gravity in the usual CDM approximation. This
can be modelled via N-body simulations. The axion ﬁeld, being single-valued, is like a ﬂuid, so its velocity must
remain single-valued as it falls in, possibly leading to shocks and turbulence.

The original aim of this project was to address the question “How to make the halo of Andromeda (or any other
galaxy) with the QCD axion ﬁeld?”. This is both a dynamical question, about the evolution of axion dark matter
from the QCD phase transition until today, and a “stationary” question, about the axion ﬁeld conﬁguration in the
galaxy over the past several billion years. Sections 2 and 3 address the “stationary” part of the question. We give
approximate solutions of the equations of motion of the axion and Newtonian gravity, and call these self-gravitating
solutions “drops”. Such solutions have been studied for a wide range of parameters, in the literature for “Bose
stars” [12, 13] and galactic halos [14, 15]. They are discussed very completely by Rindler-Daller and Shapiro (RDS) [14]
and Chavanis, Chavanis and Delﬁni [15], where can be found extensive references. As pointed out by Barranco and

Bernal [16], and noticed by several authors [14, 15], the mass and size of QCD axion drops is M ∼ 10−13M(cid:12) and
R ∼ 100 km, which is small compared to Andromeda (M ∼ 1012M(cid:12), R ∼ 100 kpc)1. Chavanis [15] showed that the
negative self-interaction of QCD axions gives an upper bound of this order on the size of a non-rotating drop. We
allow our drops to rotate, and ﬁnd by analytic estimates (section 2) as well as numerical solutions of the relevant
equations (section 3) that rotating drops can be about one order of magnitude more massive.
Section 4 reviews the history of the Universe in the scenario where the Peccei-Quinn phase transition occurs after
inﬂation. Hogan and Rees [17] noticed that in this scenario, there are O(1) ﬂuctuations in the energy density of the
axion ﬁeld on the scale of the horizon at the QCD phase transition. The mass of these ﬂuctuations, referred to as
“miniclusters” can be comparable or larger than the axion drop mass. So we use the virial theorem to hypothesize that,
when miniclusters gravitationally collapse, the larger ones fragment into axion drops. (The collapse of miniclusters
should be addressed numerically, which we hope to do shortly.) If this is the case, then the axion ﬁeld dark matter
in the Universe today would be in the form of axion drops, which would behave as WIMPs [16]. In particuliar, this
implies that in the neighbourhood of the sun, any coherently oscillating background axion ﬁeld is small, and is not
determined by the dark matter density, with possibly severe implications for axion dark matter searches [18].

Section 5 reviews the constraints on dark matter in the form of axion drops, which are within the mass range of
“macro dark matter”, studied in [19]. We summarize in section 6. In the appendix we provide a derivation of the
non-relativistic ﬁeld equations coupled to Newtonian gravity, starting from the general relativistic action of a real
scalar ﬁeld.

2 The axion “drop”: a stable gravitationally bound conﬁguration

The aim of this section is to identify stable conﬁgurations of the QCD axion ﬁeld, in the presence of self-interactions
and Newtonian gravity. We refer to these conﬁgurations as “drops”2. This question has been widely studied [14, 15,
16, 20, 21]; our new contribution is to allow the drops to rotate. We review analytic estimates for the mass and radius
of the drops, as a function of the various microscopic and/or external parameters (m, fPQ, mPl,...), which imply that
the drops ressemble asteroids. The purpose of the analytic estimates is to understand how the mass and radius of the
drops scale; so the estimates only need to be of the right order of magnitude.

The drops may rotate, but we neglect time-variation of the radial density proﬁle. This means that our drop is
not allowed a “breathing mode”, which could be compatible with long-term stability; we suppose that this would not
signiﬁcantly change the parameters we are interested in.

the numerical simulations of Kawasaki, Saikawa and Sekiguchi [10] (hereafter KSS) suggest that this gives the correct
dark matter abundance. fPQ is the breaking scale of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, here taken to be ﬁxed in terms of
the axion mass by eqn (2). The potential (1) is therefore a one-parameter potential determined by m.

Bose Einstein condensation of cold atoms to galaxy halos made of m ∼ 10−20 eV bosons. A useful review about this
equation is [26].

The dynamics of the axion ﬁeld coupled to gravity can be obtained from T µν

;ν = 0, or from the Klein Gordon
equation. The axion T µν is parametrised by the axion energy density ρ and ﬂuid three-velocity (cid:126)v, which are more
intuitive variables for Large-Scale-Structure (LSS) than the ﬁeld. The transformation between these two parametrisa-
tions is discussed in the works of Chavanis[15] and Rindler-Daller and Shapiro (RDS) [14]. The stress-energy tensor
for the non-relativistic axion ﬁeld, in cartesian coordinates for ﬂat space-time (Newtonian gravity can be added later
by hand), is

From the Euler equation, one can already see that a stationary solution (neglecting rotation, so setting the left
side of Euler to zero) should balance the outwards gradient pressure represented by the ﬁrst term, against the inwards
gravitational and self-interaction pressures. The self-interaction pressure is inwards because the density decreases with
r, so ∂rρ < 0. An estimate for the mass M and radius R of an axion drop can be obtained by replacing ∇ → 1/R,
ρ → M/R3 on the right-hand-side of the Euler equation, and solving the resulting quadratic equation for R:

This exhibits an upper bound on the drop mass, as found by Chavanis, as well as the usual “virial” relation between
the radius and mass of an object supported against gravity by pressure. Below we will use the virial theorem to obtain
a more reliable equation, but this already indicates the parametric dependence of the mass and radius of the drop.
Notice that the maximum drop mass ∝ 1/m2, so lighter axions can form larger drops. Solving for R at the maximum
mass M ∼ 10−14M(cid:12), gives R ∼ 100 km.

More sophisticated estimates are obtained, for instance, by Chavanis or RDS, by guessing a functional form for
ρ((cid:126)r), and minimising the energy functional that gives the GP equation. RDS consider bosons of variable mass and

positive self-interaction (which provide an outward pressure, helpful in obtaining cores for galactic halos), and ﬁnd
rotating ﬁeld conﬁgurations which could be galactic halos for bosons of mass m ∼ 10−20 eV. Chavanis considers
variable masses and self-interactions of either sign, and looks for non-rotating solutions. For a QCD axion (negative
self-interaction), and a non-rotating drop, Chavanis found a maximum mass of 10mPlfPQ/m, by minimising an energy
functional with an exponential ansatz for the radial proﬁle of the density.

Estimates similiar to eqn (11) can be obtained using the virial theorem.

We assume in this paper, following RDS, that a rotating axion drop should also satisfy the virial condition eqn (13).
We consider rotating drops of axion ﬁeld, and estimate whether the rotation could allow them to be signiﬁcantly more
massive than the estimate of eqn (11). To obtain an ansatz for the rotating drop, notice the ressemblance between
the (non-linear) GP equation and the (linear) Schrodinger equation for the Hydrogen atom, the latter having well-
known solutions in terms of spherical harmonics. It is convenient to start from the axion ﬁeld, rather than ρ and (cid:126)v,
because the phase of the ﬁeld should be continuous, and this condition is less simple to impose on ρ and (cid:126)v. Following
Tkachev [28], we suppose the rotating axion drop has the functional form in radial coordinates

3. Asteroids in our solar system can have masses and radii comparable to the non-rotating axion drops, and tend
to have rotation periods ∼ 6 hours. However, their formation history diﬀers from that of axion drops, so it is
unclear whether this is a relevant analogy. The equatorial rotation frequency of a drop described by eqn (15),
evaluated at the radius rc, would be ω (cid:39) l/(r2

c m) (cid:39) 6l/day, which suggests that low l values are realistic.

4. With the ansatz of eqn (15), the parameter l describes two distinct physical aspects of the drop: its rotation,
and also its ﬂattening into a disk. However, we allow this degeneracy, because we only consider l values of order
a few, due to the previous point.

We see that the gravitational and self-interaction energies grow as

disk for large l (as a result of our ansatz (16)), so the density is larger to stay at constant mass. The kinetic energy
grows quadratically with l, both because the drop has angular momentum, and because of the gradient in θ. Solving

which, for l = 0, reproduces the parametric dependence of the estimates obtained from the Euler equation in eqn (11).
However, the constants are unreliable, because Chavanis obtained a maximum mass of ∼ 10−13 M(cid:12) with an exponential
ansatz for the radial density proﬁle of a spherically symmetric solution. So we suppose the upper bound is

For l ∼ few, which corresponds to the rotation rates of asteroids, the maximum mass of the drop can grow by an order
of magnitude or so. This behaviour is conﬁrmed by the numerical calculations presented in the next section.
The upper bound on the size of the drop arises because the self-interaction energy of the QCD axion is negative
(equivalently, it exerts an inwards force, like gravity): if the mass M inside a volume ∼ R3 is to high, the gradients
cannot compensate the self-interaction energy. However, the QCD axion has a cosine potential, see eqn (1), and not the
unbounded-below −|g||φ|4 potential used to compute Esi. So one can wonder whether the maximum mass is an artifact
of expanding the potential. It seems no: a more correct version of the potential, in the non-relativistic approximation

Considering the GP equation at large radii and requiring that R(r) decreases exponentially we ﬁnd that ˜E should be

the electron. We ﬁnd this analogy useful, despite that, in our classical ﬁeld theory, the energy is a volume integral

Our procedure is now as follows: We set ˜V (cid:48)

and |E| (cid:28) m, which justiﬁes the nonrelativistic treatment.
N (0) = 0 and pick some values for ˜R(0) and ˜VN (0). Then we search for
˜R(cid:48)(0) by a shooting method, such that for the solution ˜R, ˜R(cid:48) and ˜V (cid:48)
N go to zero at large ˜r. If a solution is found we
can then calculate the corresponding total mass ˜M , the radius containing 99% of the mass, ˜r99, and ˜E. In Fig. 1 we
show the behaviour of the total mass of the drop, ˜M , for the cases l = 0, 1, 2, 3. Beyond the point where the curves
stop we could not ﬁnd any solution with physical boundary conditions, indicating the existence of a maximal possible
mass. When we try to extend the curves beyond the maximal mass, the solutions diverge at large radii. In Fig. 2 (left
panel) we show the radial proﬁles for the maximal mass for each l value. For those solutions we required zero nodes
of ˜R(r).
For l > 0 physically interesting solutions have vanishing wave function at the centre, since the angular momentum
term in the GP equation diverges as r → 0 for ﬁnite R(0). For the numerics, we ﬁx ˜R at 0.01 for l = 1 and at 10−4

˜R(cid:48)(0) in order to obtain a physically interesting solution, converging at large radii. For l = 0, ˜R(0) is non-zero and we
have to scan also over this parameter, in addition to ˜VN (0) and ˜R(cid:48)(0).

Our results for the l = 0 case are in qualitative agreement with ﬁgs. 4 and 5 from [21]. However, sofar we could
not ﬁnd solutions with smaller ˜r99 as the one corresponding to the maximal mass (cf. ﬁg. 4 of [21]) or equivalently
larger ˜R(0) (cf. ﬁg. 1 of [30]). Note that to search for l = 0 solutions we have restricted the derivative ˜R(cid:48)(0) to be
small (the condition we impose is | ˜R(cid:48)(0)| < ˜R(0)). If we allow for large derivatives at small radii solutions are found
for diﬀerent combinations of ˜R(0) and ˜VN (0). Those allow also for slightly larger total masses, although qualitatively
the behaviour is similar to the shown solutions.
We ﬁnd that the solutions for l > 0 are more massive than in the l = 0 case by about a factor 3 for l = 1, a factor
5 for l = 2, and a factor 8 for l = 3, but the size increases only slightly, from ˜r99 ≈ 5 to 7. Restricting to solutions
with zero nodes we did not ﬁnd any solution for l ≥ 4.

In Fig. 3 we show solutions with 1 to 6 nodes for the case with l = 1. We observe that signiﬁcantly larger masses
can be obtained for multi-node solutions. Fig. 2 (right panel) shows three examples for the wave function with l = 1
and 3, 4, and 5 nodes. For all three examples the total mass is approximately ˜M ≈ 40. We have also searched for
multi-node solutions with higher values of l. As in the zero-node case, we have not found physical solutions for l ≥ 4.

The results of our numerical study of the GPP system can be summarized as follows.

1. We recover the well known result from the literature that for the “ground state” with zero nodes and l = 0 there

is a maximal possible mass, let’s call this maximal mass of the ground state ˜M max

an upper bound on the angular momentum of the drop. It deserves further study.

In this paper we have not considered the question of stability of solutions against small perturbations. Ref. [31]
has found that for the non-interacting and non-rotating case, only the ground-state with zero-nodes is stable, whereas
solutions with nodes are unstable with respect to oscillations, see also [13]. We leave the stability analysis of multi-l
and multi-node solutions for the QCD axion case for future investigations. This question needs to be addressed as
well within the dynamical framework of the formation of the axion drops.

4 From the QCD phase transition till today

4.1 Estimating the minicluster mass

We suppose that the Peccei-Quinn phase transition occurs after inﬂation, leaving a massless axion ﬁeld which is
random from one horizon-volume to the next, a network of cosmic strings, and no domain walls. Shortly before the
QCD phase transition, the axion mass is expected to turn on, generating the potential (1). This leads to two axion
contributions to dark matter:

1. It causes the network of cosmic strings to decay. This process is simulated numerically [9, 32, 33]; the recent
results of KSS [10] give two comparable contributions to axion dark matter. From the Peccei Quinn phase
transition until the axion mass turns on, the string network radiates axions with p ∼ H. Then domain walls
form between the strings, separating regions of ±a, and subsequently this wall-string network decays away to
axions with p ∼ m(T ) ∼ H.

2. The axion ﬁeld, random in each horizon-volume, is likely to be misaligned with respect to the minimum of the
potential, so will roll down and oscillate. The initial magnitude of the ﬁeld, averaged over many horizons, is
πfPQ/

3. The oscillations redshift like cold dark matter [7, 8, 34].

√

Combining these contributions to axion dark matter, KSS [10] obtained an appropriate relic density for m ∼
10−4 eV. Only ∼ 25% of this CDM is due to the misalignment ﬁeld, the remainder is in the incoherent distribution of
axion modes produced by strings.

In this paper, we are interested in the misalignment axion ﬁeld, which can have two types of density ﬂuctuations.
It inherits the large-scale adiabatic density ﬂuctuations present in radiation, which will later grow into the observed
Large Scale Structure. More interesting for us, are the short-distance, isocurvature “miniclusters”, originally discussed
by Hogan and Rees [17], and extensively studied by Kolb and Tkachev [35]. These arise because the axion ﬁeld is
random, from one horizon to the next, as the axion mass turns on before the QCD PT. This gives O(1) density
ﬂuctuations on the QCD horizon scale, which are frozen in the expanding radiation until matter-radiation equality,
then decouple from the Hubble expansion and collapse.

We want to estimate the mass of a minicluster. This will depend on the coherence length and energy density of
the axion ﬁeld, evaluated as the axion mass turns on. The temperature dependence of the axion mass is equivalent
to the topological susceptibility χ(T ) of the QCD plasma, which has been widely studied. Here we consider three
possible behaviours for m2(T ) prior to the QCD phase transition.
In the interacting instanton liquid of [36], the
temperature-dependent axion mass can be written

(38)

with ΛQCD = 400 MeV, and where c = 4 × 10−4, n = 6.68. (The zero-temperature mass is obtained for n = 0,
c = 4 × 10−2, and m(T ) should stop growing when it reaches the zero-temperature mass.) The instanton liquid
gives a less-steep turn-on than dilute instanton gas estimates [37, 34], and is the parametrisation used by KSS [10] to
estimate that m ∼ 10−4 eV gives the correct relic density of axion CDM today. A recent lattice-based estimate [22]
suggests that the axion mass could turn on more slowly, with c (cid:39) 3× 10−3, n (cid:39) 2, whereas the lattice-based analysis of
Kitano and Yamada [38] explored the possibility that the axion mass turns on exponentially at the critical temperature
Tc (cid:39) 150 MeV.

Once the axion mass reaches its zero temperature value m, the minicluster mass can be estimated as

Mmini ∼ Vosc m(T = 0) nosc E ,

(39)

PQ(cid:104)θ2

i (cid:105) ≈ m(Tosc)f 2

where Tosc is the temperature when m(Tosc) = 3H(Tosc), Vosc and nosc are the volume of the horizon and the comoving
axion number density at that moment, and E is an enhancement factor which takes into account that the axion ﬁeld
is inhomogeneous so starts to oscillate at diﬀerent times in diﬀerent horizons. We take Vosc ∼ 1/[8H 3(Tosc)] and
nosc ∼ m(Tosc)f 2
PQπ2/3. It is reasonable to take the minicluster volume to be Vosc, because recall
that the ﬁeld was initially random on much smaller scales, and is smoothed to the horizon-scale by the dynamics of a
massless scalar ﬁeld. The enhancement factor E arises because, in horizons where a ∼ πfPQ, the axion potential does
not have a m2a2 form, and the beginning of oscillations (with the associated 1/R3 red-shifting of the energy density)
is delayed. Several studies [37, 39, 34] have estimated E ∼ 2 → 8 by numerically solving the equations of motion7.
However it is unclear in these analyses, whether the ﬁeld gradients are included in the equations of motion. The
gradients are explicitly included in the analysis [35], who ﬁnd that the axion ﬁeld could remain trapped at a ∼ πfPQ
while the temperature dropped by an order of magnitude. However, the a ∼ πfPQ conﬁgurations of this analysis may
correspond to the domain walls that form between strings, after the axions get a mass, and whose decay is studied by
KSS [10]. We take E = 8. (This may be large, but other authors take the horizon volume to be V = 1/H 3. We have
EV = 1/H 3.) This leads to

Mmini ∼ π2mf 2
PQ
H 2(Tosc)

.

(40)

With the parameters corresponding to the interacting instanton liquid of [36], and fPQ (cid:39) 6 × 1010 GeV as found

by KSS, we ﬁnd the axion starts to oscillate around T ∼ 1 → 2 GeV, giving

Mmini ∼ 3 × 10−13M(cid:12) .

(41)

This is similar to the value found in [45], but smaller than the original estimate of Hogan and Rees [17], whose
miniclusters formed at T = 100 MeV in a CDM-dominated Universe.
In the case of the more gradual turn-on of
the axion mass advocated in [22], the axion starts to oscillate sooner (Tosc ∼ few GeV), so the miniclusters could be
an order of magnitude smaller. If the axion mass turns on exponentially at the QCD phase transition, as discussed
in [38], then it is possible that the axion would contribute to much CDM. Requiring that the observed dark matter
density is due to axions in this scenario, the axion could start to oscillate at T ∼ ΛQCD, giving miniclusters an order
of magnitude or so larger.

Interestingly, Mmini of eqn (41) is not so diﬀerent from the maximum mass of a stable drop estimated in eqn (22).
This appears to be an accident: the maximum mass of a drop is determined by balancing the kinetic pressure against
the gravitational and self-interaction forces — whereas the mass of a minicluster is determined by the volume of the
horizon when the axion starts to oscillate. To see why these are similar, recall that the axion starts to oscillate when
3H(Tosc) ∼ m(Tosc). Replacing 25mfPQ ∼ Λ2

where the last estimate used n/2 = 3.34, for which the last fraction is ∼ 50. The estimates of the minicluster and
drop masses, given in eqns (41) and (22), are both very uncertain. In both cases, formation is a dynamical process
which should generate a spectrum of masses. So we take these estimates to have an uncertainty of at least an order of
magnitude, and conclude that the average minicluster mass could be of order the maximum drop mass, or a hundred
times larger.

4.2

Speculations on how to make Andromeda

We can now speculate on how axion dark matter could make the Andromeda galaxy, in the case where the Peccei-Quinn
phase transition occurs after inﬂation.

After the QCD phase transition, there are two contributions to axion dark matter: the misalignment ﬁeld, and
the incoherent distribution of modes produced by strings. It is convenient to refer to this phase space distribution of
modes as “particles”, to distinguish it from the misalignment ﬁeld (distributions of classical waves evolve in a way very

7Notice that E is the enhancement in the density of overdense regions, whereas often the enhancement in the average density is given.

similar to distributions of particles [40]). Once the axion mass has settled to its zero-temperature value, the particles
are non-relativistic, with velocity ∼ H(ΛQCD)/m ∼ 10−5c (for m = 10−4 eV). Despite their small mass, these particles
should be suﬃciently “cold” to virialise and form a galactic halo of particles with v ∼ 0.001c.

There are two types of density perturbations that can arise in the ﬁeld and in the particles. On large scales,
they both inherited from the surrounding radiation, the scale-free, adiabatic density ﬂuctuations produced during
inﬂation. Then, due to the dynamics at the QCD phase transition, the ﬁeld has O(1) density ﬂuctuations on the QCD

horizon scale (∼ 0.03 pc today), which give a white noise spectrum (δM/M ∼(cid:112)Mmini/M ) of density ﬂuctuations

on small scales. These are the miniclusters. The particles might also have a similar small-scale spectrum. These
density ﬂuctuations are frozen into the radiation plasma until they dominate the radiation density (see e.g. [41]). At
matter-radiation equality, the large-scale ﬂuctuation which will eventually become Andromeda, which has an initial
amplitude δρ/ρ <∼ 10−4, can start to grow. Meanwhile, the short-distance O(1) inhomogeneities, such as miniclusters,
decouple from the Hubble ﬂow and collapse.

We now focus on the smale-scale inhomogeneities in the ﬁeld. A realistic and accurate calculation of minicluster
formation would give a spectrum: the number density of miniclusters as a function of their mass. Those with mass
less than the maximum allowed for drops should initially collapse to axion drops. Hogan and Rees [17] speculate
that miniclusters undergo hierarchical clustering, however it is unclear to us how this would occur: do small drops
amalgamate to form larger drops, or do the drops cluster like dark matter particles?

In the case that a minicluster exceeds the maximum drop mass, the virial theorem suggests that the miniclusters
fragment into stable drops. The point is that the virial condition implies that the (negative) gravitational energy gained
in collapse should be compensated by kinetic energy, so one can anticipate that the minicluster fragments into smaller
ﬁeld conﬁgurations, in the presence of steep ﬁeld gradients. This would of course require numerical veriﬁcation. The
alternative is that the minicluster collapses to a black hole. However, it is often argued that O(1) density ﬂuctuations
should be of horizon-scale in order to collapse to black holes [42], which is not the case for miniclusters.

In this paper, we do not consider small-scale inhomogeneities in the density of axions produced by strings. The
string network is very inhomogeneous, but decays to relativistic axion particles [10], which become non-relativistic as
the temperature-dependent axion mass increases towards its zero-temperature value. The degree to which the particle
density becomes smooth by free-streaming, prior to the axions becoming non-relativistic, is unclear (to us). Kolb and
Tkachev explored this question [45], using a dilute instanton gas approximation for m(T ), and argue that the axions
from strings also have O(1) density ﬂuctuations on the QCD horizon scale. This corresponds to the original analysis
of Hogan and Rees [17], where the miniclusters were assumed to be composed of axion particles. Hogan and Rees
estimate that the cores of miniclusters could survive the hierarchical merging of miniclusters and the galaxy formation
process, but that a signiﬁcant fraction of axion particles would be thrown oﬀ, and would today contribute a smooth
halo density of axion particles, as could for instance be detected by axion dark matter search experiments such as
ADMX [18].

On the other hand, if a signiﬁcant fraction of axion dark matter is in the form of drops, this would reduce the signal
in direct detection. Denoting the mass fraction of axion drops to the smooth halo component by fdrop, we expect a
number density of drops with mass 10−13 M(cid:12) of order fdrop × 10−44 cm−3, which implies about fdrop × 10−5 drops
in a volume of (1 AU)3 and a drop ﬂux on Earth of fdrop × 10−34 cm−2 s−1. (We have assumed a local dark matter
density of 0.4 GeV cm−3 and a drop velocity in the galactic halo of 10−3 c.) Hence, ADMX would see only the smooth
component of the halo, which will be reduced by a factor (1 − fdrop).

5 Observational bounds

The observational signatures of “macroscopic” dark matter objects, with masses from grams to several solar masses
were recently compiled in [19]. The case of primordial black holes is reviewed in [43]; while black holes created
with M <∼ 10−18M(cid:12) would evaporate in the lifetime of the Universe, there is a window [44] 10−13M(cid:12) <∼ MP BH <∼
10−9M(cid:12) where they could constitute the dark matter (the lower bound is from femtolensing, the upper bound from
microlensing). This window is interesting, because in the case that large miniclusters collapsed to black holes, they
would be in this allowed range. Kolb and Tkachev [45] discussed the sensitivity of femto- and pico-lensing experiments
axion miniclusters. Zurek etal [46] consider astrophysical eﬀects of miniclusters in the wide range of 10−12 → 104 M(cid:12).
Here we suppose that axion ﬁeld dark matter is in the form of drops, with M <∼ 10−13 → 10−12M(cid:12) and review the
femtolensing bound. Other possible constraints are listed.

11

5.1 Femtolensing

Micro-lensing is the familiar idea of watching nearby stars (e.g. in the LMC), in the hope of observing an increase in
their light due to a compact halo object crossing the line of sight. Femtolensing [47] uses Gamma Ray Bursters (GRBs)
as sources, which are at cosmological distances, and most of which only last for a few seconds. The lensing objects
are therefore distributed in intervening galaxies and intergalactic space. And rather than looking for an ampliﬁcation
in light signal, one looks for the interference between light that took two diﬀerent paths round the lensing object: the
time delay between the two paths is the same for photons of diﬀerent energies, so one looks for oscillations in the
energy spectrum of GRBs.
Femtolensing is an idea of Gould [47], that lensing by dark objects with 10−16M(cid:12) <∼ M <∼ 10−13M(cid:12) could give
interference patterns in the energy spectrum of GRBs. A bound based on BATSE data [48], could exclude Ω ∼ 0.2 for
the mass range 10−16 → 10−13M(cid:12), and these authors also estimated picolensing bounds, and found a 1 σ sensitivity
to Ω ∼ 1 of compact objects in the mass range 10−12.5M(cid:12) → 10−9M(cid:12). In a careful and dedicated analysis of FERMI
data, Barnacka etal [49] focussed on GRBs at measured redshift, and were able to exclude Ω > 0.03 in compact objects
of mass between 5× 10−17 → 5× 10−15M(cid:12), which is somewhat below the maximum drop mass estimated in eqn (22).
The exclusion of [49] assumes that the GRB can be treated as point source. Otherwise, various photons emitted by
the GRB could have diﬀerent time delays in their paths around the lens (because they come from diﬀerent locations
on the source), and the oscillations in the intensity-summed-over-photons could be washed out [47]. The GRB can
be treated as point source provided that its “size”, projected onto the lens plane, is smaller than the Einstein radius

rE = 2(cid:112)GN M (DOLDLS/DOS), where the distances D are between Observer, Source and Lens. It is unclear, from

the estimates in [49], that this condition is satisﬁed (such doubts were expressed in [50]). Furthermore, the GRB size
estimates in [51] are one or two orders of magnitude larger than those in [49]. It would be helpful if the status of these
constraints was conﬁrmed by expert authors.

5.2 Other constraints?

Axion drops as dark matter could have many other observable consequences, due to their interactions with the CMB,
magnetic ﬁelds, or other astrophysical objects, due to their passage in our local area, and so on. Some possibilities are
listed here. Questions which arise, for some of these constraints, are whether the drop accretes baryons (see e.g. [46]),
and how it interacts with photons (discussed in [52]).

1. Carr and Sakkelariadou [53] considered dynamical constraints on compact objects, which could disrupt the
structures we see. They expect that compact objects in the mass range 10−18 → 10−11M(cid:12) could ressemble
comets. From the non-observation of interstellar comets in the past 300 years, they impose that no compact
objects (CO) passed through a disk of radius one earth-sun distance (astronomical unit= AU) in 300 years,
which implies, following [54]:

M >

ΩCO
ΩDM

10−13M(cid:12) .

(42)

So for drop masses >∼ few ×10−14M(cid:12), this observation does not pose a constraint. Whether there is a bound on
smaller drops would require study, to determine whether they shine like baryonic comets.

2. There are constraints on DM-photon interactions from CMB observations, for instance as given in [55] — it
would be interesting to understand if these apply to axion drops? In [19], it is argued that macroscopic compact
objects have a geometric cross-section with photons, and can be subject to the same “collisional damping” (Silk
damping) constraints as particle dark matter. Whether this is the case for drops might depend on whether they
accumulate baryons.

3. Do the drops evaporate due to self-interactions?

The rate at which four axions from the condensate (ﬁeld) could evaporate into two particles with energy ∼ 2m
is estimated8 in [8] as ∼ m3a6/f 4
PQ. For a/fPQ ∼ fPQ/mPl, as obtained in the axion drop, this evaporation
timescale is much longer than the age of the Universe.
The decay of axion drops due to emission of real axions because of the the self-interaction term via a 3a → a
process has been studied in [56]. This process becomes kinematically allowed when the whole axion drop balances
momentum. It has been found that if conﬁgurations close to the maximal possible total mass of the drop are

considered, the decay becomes relevant for axion masses around (cid:46) 10−8 eV, but should be unimportant for
m ∼ 10−4 eV, as implied by fPQ ∼ 1011 GeV.
Axion particles in the galactic halo (originally produced by string decay), could scatter axions out of the drops.
The rate for this process was estimated in [57] to be ∼ nam2/f 4
PQ × fBE, where fBE is a Bose enhancement
factor that accounts for the high occupation number of the axion particles, which can locally be estimated as
fBE ∼ 0.3 GeV/(m4v3cm3) ∼ 1020 (for v ∼ 0.001c the local virial velocity). The fraction of axions scattered out
of drops in the age of the Universe τU is therefore ∼ (mfBE/mPl) (cid:28) 1.

4. One can ask what happens if a drop meets an ordinary star, a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole.
Collisions of axion drops with white dwarfs and neutron stars [58] have been proposed as a source for GRBs, as
well as to explain other anomalies. However the energy released in the collision of a drop with a neutron star is
controversial [30] (as is also the case for the interactions of primordial black holes with neutron stars [50, 59, 60]).

5. The “explosion” of axion drops was recently proposed as a possible source for Fast Radio Bursts [61].

Summary

Dark matter composed of the QCD axion can be produced either by the misalignment mechanism, giving rise to an
axion ﬁeld, or by the decay of strings, which produces a distribution of axion modes/particles. We consider stable axion
ﬁeld conﬁgurations, held together by gravity and self-interactions, and conﬁrm that they have typical dimensions of
100 km and a mass scale M ∼ 10−13M(cid:12) ∼ 10−7M⊕ ∼ 1017 kg. The maximum mass of the drop arises from balancing
the inward gravity and self-interaction pressures against kinetic gradient pressure.

We allowed the axion drops to rotate, and found that the maximum mass can increase by about an order of
magnitude. This result is estimated analytically in section 2 using the virial theorem, and obtained in section 3 from
numerical solutions of the classical ﬁeld equations. In both cases we have assumed that the axion ﬁeld in the drop is
proportional to a single spherical harmonic Y l
m(ϑ, ϕ). In realistic situations one may expect that the ﬁeld is a general
m. Nevertheless, our simpliﬁed ansatz indicates that modestly rotating drops (l (cid:46) few)
linear combination of several Y l
may be somewhat heavier than non-rotating conﬁgurations.

In this work, we looked for stable solutions, but did not study the dynamical process of drop formation (which
would depend on the earlier cosmological evolution). Nonetheless, in section 4, we speculate on how axion drops could
arise if the Peccei-Quinn phase transition occurs after inﬂation. In this scenario, the misalignment axions are only a
component of the dark matter, and have O(1) inhomogeneities on the horizon scale of the QCD phase transition which
are refered to as miniclusters. The estimated mass of miniclusters is slightly larger than the maximum mass of stable
axion drops, so we envisage that the miniclusters could fragment into drops. On the other hand, if the Peccei-Quinn
phase transition occurs before inﬂation, then the misalignment axions compose all the axion dark matter, but there
are no miniclusters, and it is an open question whether large-scale density ﬂuctuations would fragment on small scales
into drops.

In section 5, we reviewed observational constraints on dark matter in the form of asteroid sized objects, and it
appears that dark matter halos made of axion drops could be consistent with observations. Interesting constraints
close to the relevant mass range are obtained by femtolensing. Several other potential constraints depend whether
axion drops accrete baryons, which we did not study.

It is interesting to speculate on the implications of axion drops for direct detection experiments, such as ADMX [18].
Recall that in the cosmological scenario where the Peccei-Quinn phase transition occurs after inﬂation, current nu-
merical simulations [10] suggest that ∼ 75% of axion dark matter is composed of particles produced by strings. As
reviewed at the end of section 4.2, these axion particles could provide a smooth halo component, as searched for by
ADMX. However, the dark matter fraction stored in drops would be hidden from axion direct detection experiments.

gµν and the ﬁeld a one obtaines the coupled Klein-Gordon and Einstein equations. Here we are going to derive the
non-relativistic limit, where all velocities are small compared to c and energies small compared to m. We follow closely

ﬁeld a in terms of a complex non-relativistic ﬁeld φ as in eqn (3). The non-relativistic approximation assumes that φ
varies only slowly on time scales 1/m:

and all factors containg exponentials e±imt average to zero when integrated over t in the action. Note that with the
ansatz for φ from eqn (23) the above approximation just means E (cid:28) m, which has been conﬁrmed to hold for our
