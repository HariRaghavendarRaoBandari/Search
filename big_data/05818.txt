Boundedly ﬁnite measures:

Separation and convergence by an algebra of functions

Wolfgang L¨ohr1, Thomas Rippl2,3

March 21, 2016

Abstract

We prove general results about separation and weak#-convergence of boundedly ﬁnite
measures on separable metric spaces and Souslin spaces. More precisely, we consider an
algebra of bounded real-valued, or more generally a ∗-algebra F of bounded complex-valued
functions and give conditions for it to be separating or weak#-convergence determining for
those boundedly ﬁnite measures that integrate all functions in F . For separation, it is suﬃcient
if F separates points, vanishes nowhere, and either consists of only countably many measurable
functions, or of arbitrarily many continuous functions. For convergence determining, it is
suﬃcient if F induces the topology of the underlying space, and every bounded set A admits
a function in F with values bounded away from zero on A.

Introduction

Boundedly ﬁnite measures play an increasingly important role in probability theory. Classical
examples are Itˆo excursion measures, or L´evy measures, which we will come back to in a moment.
But they also appear in very recent research as speed measures of Brownian motions on R-trees
[AEW13, ALW15] or population density measures for spatial Fleming-Viot processes [GSW15].
Convergence of metric measure spaces with boundedly ﬁnite measures has been analysed with a
view towards probabilistic applications in [ALW16].

For the purpose of illustration, we quickly recall the situation for L´evy measures of inﬁnitely
divisible random variables. A real-valued random variable X is called inﬁnitely divisible if, for any
n ∈ , we can write X d= X1,n + · · · + Xn,n for an i.i.d. sequence of random variables (Xi,n)1≤i≤n.
A famous theorem by L´evy and Khintchine states that in that case the Fourier transform of the
random variable has a very explicit form:

(1) − log E(cid:2)exp(−iuX)(cid:3) = iub +

where b ∈ R, c ≥ 0 and µ is a measure on R \ {0} satisfying RR\{0} 1 ∧ |y|2 µ(dy) < ∞, see

Theorem 8.1 of [Sat99]. Let us look at the measure µ, called L´evy measure. The obvious questions
are: (a) is the L´evy measure unique?1 (b) If we have a sequence of inﬁnitely divisible random
variables, do their L´evy measures converge and in which sense? L´evy measures are not necessarily
ﬁnite measures, but are required to be ﬁnite on any set which is not close to the origin 0. This
motivates to consider measures which are ﬁnite on a certain class of sets. Daley and Vere-Jones
used Appendix A2.6 in [DVJ03] to present a framework for such questions which they call boundedly
ﬁnite measures, because the measures are assumed to be ﬁnite on bounded sets. The space of these
measures is equipped with weak#-convergence, deﬁned as convergence of integrals over bounded
continuous functions with bounded support (see Section 2 for deﬁnitions). Some extensions are
given in [HL06] and [LRR14]. L´evy measures ﬁt into this framework if we change the Euclidean
metric on R \ {0} such that 0 is sent inﬁnitely far away, an idea also used in [BP06].

How does one prove weak convergence µn

w−→ µ of probability measures on a topological space

X in situations where it is not feasible to show convergence ofR f dµn for all bounded continuous

f ∈ Cb(X) directly? One possibility is to ﬁnd a class F ⊆ Cb(X) of suﬃciently “nice” functions,
which is still rich enough to be convergence determining, i.e.

Z f dµn →Z f dµ ∀ f ∈ F

=⇒ µn

w−→ µ.

This approach has proven to be particularly fruitful if the topology on X itself is deﬁned in terms
of a class of functions. A classical example for such a topology is the weak (weak-∗) topology on
(the dual of) a Banach space. A more modern one is the Gromov-weak topology on the space of
metric measure spaces, which is induced both by a complete metric and by a class of functions
called polynomials (see [GPW09]). That polynomials do not only induce the topology but are
even convergence determining was shown with some eﬀort in [DGP11]. But it also follows directly
from a general result due to Le Cam, as pointed out in [L¨oh13]. Le Cam’s theorem goes back to
[LC57] and states that on a completely regular Hausdorﬀ space X, a set of functions F ⊆ Cb(X) is
convergence determining for Radon probability measures if it is multiplicatively closed and induces
the topology of X. The proof can be found in [HJ77, Proposition 4.1]. A version of Le Cam’s
theorem for separable metric spaces dropping the “Radon” assumption on the probability measures
is given in [BK10]. This version was used extensively for the construction of a tree-valued pruning
process in [LVW15].

Our main goal is to extend Le Cam’s result to the case of boundedly ﬁnite measures and
weak#-convergence and, because convergence determining is sometimes too much to ask for, to
obtain (weaker) suﬃcient conditions for F to at least separate boundedly ﬁnite measures. A
separating class of functions can also be used to prove weak (or weak#) convergence if tightness
is known by other methods. In particular, our results allow to give an answer on the question
of uniqueness and convergence of µ in (1) within a general framework. More importantly, they
will ﬁnd applications in future work about spaces of metric measure spaces and R-trees such as
in the upcoming paper [GGR] which was a driving motivation for the present article. The results
will hopefully also facilitate the analysis of spatial population models on unbounded spaces with
inﬁnite total population size such as the one in [GSW15], and of other models appearing in modern
areas of probability theory.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give our main results about
convergence determining (Theorem 2.3) and separating (Theorem 2.7 and Corollary 2.8) classes of
functions for boundedly ﬁnite measures. In Section 3, we illustrate in four examples how our results
can be applied. There, we consider L´evy measures, excursion theory and mass fragmentations.

2 Separation and convergence of boundedly ﬁnite measures

Let (X, d) be a separable metric space, endowed with the Borel σ-ﬁeld induced by d. By Cb(X),
we denote the set of bounded continuous functions on the metric space (X, d) with values in C.
For real-valued functions we write Cb(X; R). Note that Cb(X; R) ⊆ Cb(X).

1this question has an aﬃrmative answer with a neat proof in [BCR76] Theorem 3.7

Deﬁnition 2.1 (Boundedly ﬁnite measures and weak#-convergence). The set of boundedly ﬁnite
measures M#(X) on X w.r.t. d is given as

M#(X) = {µ ∈ M(X) | µ(A) < ∞ for all d-bounded, measurable A ⊆ X} .

w#

A sequence (µn)n∈ in M#(X) is said to be weak#-convergent to µ ∈ M#(X), denoted by
µn
♦

−−→ µ, ifR f dµn →R f, dµ holds for all f ∈ Cb(X; R) with d-bounded support.

Remark 2.2 (Weak#-convergence versus vague convergence). If (X, d) is a Heine-Borel space, i.e.
every closed, bounded set is compact, then M#(X) coincides with the set of Radon measures on
X, and weak#-convergence with vague convergence. For a general separable metric space, however,
M#(X) is a subset of the Radon measures and weak#-convergence is a potentially much stronger
convergence than vague convergence.
♣

Consider a set F of measurable, C-valued functions on X and deﬁne

MF (X) =nµ ∈ M(X)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Z |f (x)| µ(dx) < ∞ ∀ f ∈ Fo, M#

Theorem 2.3 (Convergence determining for boundedly ﬁnite measures). Let (X, d) be a separable
metric space and F ⊂ Cb(X). Assume that

F (X) = M#(X) ∩ MF (X).

(T.1) F is multiplicatively closed and closed under complex conjugation.

(T.2) F induces the topology of X.

(T.3) For every bounded set A ⊂ X there exists f ∈ F and δ > 0 with inf x∈A |f (x)| > δ.

Then F is weak#-convergence determining for measures in M#

F (X), i.e.

µ, µn ∈ M#

F (X),Z f dµn →Z f dµ ∀ f ∈ F

=⇒ µn

w#
−−→ µ.

Remark 2.4.

1. (T.1) and (T.2) are classical assumptions for these kind of theorems, see
Proposition 4.1 in [HJ77]. Something like (T.3) is necessary to replace the ﬁxed total mass in
the weak convergence of probabilities. At least, we have to ensure that F “vanishes nowhere”,
because if there was x ∈ X with f (x) = 0 for all f ∈ F , then F could not even separate a · δx
for diﬀerent a ≥ 0. For the purpose of separation of measures, we can do with this weaker
requirement S.3 in Theorem 2.7 below. We do not know, however, if it would be enough for
Theorem 2.3.

2. For real-valued functions, the part “closed under complex conjugation” is always satisﬁed. ♣

For the proof, we embed everything in the Hilbert cube H, a technique going back to Urysohn’s
work on metrisation and also used in [BK10]. Recall that

H = [0, 1], with product topology.

Denote the uniform norm on Cb(H; R) by k·k := k·k∞. For 0 < δ < 1, we consider the subspace

Hδ :=(cid:8)x = (xn)n∈ ∈ H(cid:12)(cid:12) x1 ≥ δ(cid:9)

and use the following variant of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem.

Deﬁnition 2.5 (P, P0). Let P ⊆ Cb(H; R) be the set of polynomials on H (i.e. functions depending
on ﬁnitely many coordinates and an algebraic multivariate polynomial in these coordinates). Let
♦

P0 :=(cid:8)p ∈ P(cid:12)(cid:12) p(x) = 0 ∀ x = (xn)n∈ ∈ H with x1 = 0(cid:9).

Lemma 2.6 (Stone-Weierstrass variant). Let g : H → [0, 1] be continuous with supp g ⊂ Hδ for
some δ > 0. Then, for every ε > 0 there exists a polynomial pε ∈ P0 such that

|g(x) − pε(x)| ≤ εx1 ∀ x = (xn)n∈ ∈ H.

Proof. For x = (xn)n∈ ∈ H deﬁne

˜g(x) :=(x−1

0

1 g(x)

if x1 > 0,
if x1 = 0.

Then ˜g ∈ Cb(H; R) and we can use the Stone-Weierstrass theorem. So, for ε > 0 we ﬁnd ˜pε ∈ P
such that

|˜g(x) − ˜pε(x)| < ε ∀x ∈ H.

Deﬁne pε(x) := x1 ˜pε(x), x ∈ H. Then pε ∈ P0 and we get for any a ∈ (0, 1] the estimate

sup

x∈H, x1=a

a−1|g(x) − pε(x)| = sup

x∈H, x1=a

|˜g(y) − ˜pε(y)| < ε.

That is what we needed to show, as the case x1 = 0 is trivial.
Proof of Theorem 2.3. Step 1. It is enough to consider functions with values in [0, 1]: First, F may

of f , respectively. Because F is closed under complex conjugation due to (T.1), the conditions
(T.1), (T.2) and (T.3) are also satisﬁed for F ′ instead of F . Thus we may assume F to consist of

be replaced by F ′ :=(cid:8)ℜ(f ), ℑ(f )(cid:12)(cid:12) f ∈ F(cid:9), where ℜ(f ) and ℑ(f ) are the real and imaginary parts
real-valued functions. Second, F may be replaced by F ′ := {f 2 | f ∈ F }∪(cid:8)f 2(kf k∞ −f )(cid:12)(cid:12) f ∈ F(cid:9),

which is contained in the vector space generated by F and easily seen to satisfy the prerequisites
of the theorem provided that F does. Because F ′ maps to R+, we can assume, by normalisation,
that the elements of F map into [0, 1].

Step 2. By Assumption (T.2), F induces the topology of X. Because X is a separable, metric
space, it has a countable basis, and thus we can choose a countable subfamily of F that still induces
the topology of X. That is, there exists f1, f2, . . . ∈ F with 0 ≤ fm ≤ 1, such that (fm)m∈ induces
the topology of X. Then ι : X → H, x 7→ (fm(x))m∈ is a topological embedding of X into H.
Identifying X with ι(X), we assume w.l.o.g. X ⊆ H and fn to be the (restriction of the) nth
coordinate projection. In particular, being an algebra, the linear span of F contains P0 (deﬁned
in Deﬁnition 2.5).
Step 3. Let µn, µ ∈ M#

F (X) with

(2)

Z f dµn →Z f dµ ∀ f ∈ F .

For the claimed weak#-convergence, it is enough to show R g dµn →R g dµ for all g : X → [0, 1]

which have d-bounded support and are uniformly continuous with respect to some uniform structure
inducing the topology of X (by the Portmanteau theorem, Theorem 2.1 in [LRR14]). We take the
uniform structure inherited from H and ﬁx such a g. By Assumption (T.3), there is f ∈ F and
δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ supp(g) we have |f (x)| > δ. We may assume w.l.o.g. that f = f1 (if not,
we deﬁne f ′
m is still an embedding and
g uniformly continuous w.r.t. the new, stronger uniformity). Then supp(g) ⊆ Hδ. Furthermore,
since g is uniformly continuous, it can be extended continuously to the closure of X in H, and by
the Tietze extension theorem to a continuous function from H to [0, 1] with support in Hδ. We
denote the extension again by g. We also identify µn and µ with their natural extensions to H.
Step 4. g satisﬁes the assumptions of Lemma 2.6. For ε > 0, choose pε ∈ P0 ⊆ span(F ) as in the
lemma. Because µn(f1) → µ(f1), we have M := supn∈ µn(f1) < ∞ and obtain for all n ∈ 

m+1 = fm and observe that ι′ deﬁned with these f ′

1 = f , f ′

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Z pε − g dµn(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ZH

εx1 µn(dx) = εZ f1 dµn ≤ εM.

Because µn(pε) → µ(pε) by (2), we conclude for every ε > 0

lim sup
n→∞

|µn(g) − µ(g)| ≤ lim sup
n→∞

|µn(pε) − µ(pε)| + |µn(pε − g)| + |µ(pε − g)| ≤ 2εM.

Because ε is arbitrary, the claimed convergence follows.

It is desirable to have a result which separates two boundedly ﬁnite measures but requires
less than the previous theorem. While “boundedly ﬁnite” is essential for the deﬁnition of weak#-
convergence, we can drop this assumption for the purpose of separation and work with MF instead
of M#
F . We can also relax the metrisability assumption on the space X, but do need some
topological assumption. Recall that a Hausdorﬀ topological space X is, by deﬁnition, a Souslin
space if there exists a Polish space Y and a continuous surjective map from Y onto X. Note that
a Souslin space is separable but need not be metrisable. An example is a separable Banach space
in its weak topology, which is clearly Souslin but not metrisable. Conversely, not every separable
metrisable space is Souslin. In the case of a Souslin space X, and a countable family of functions
F , we can drop the topological assumptions on F from the prerequisites of Theorem 2.3 and still
obtain the weaker conclusion that F is separating for measures in MF . More precisely, we have

Theorem 2.7 (Separation of boundedly ﬁnite measures with measurable functions). Let X be
a Souslin space (e.g. a Polish space), and F a countable set of bounded, measurable C-valued
functions. Assume that

(S.1) F is multiplicatively closed and closed under complex conjugation.

(S.2) F separates points of X.

(S.3) F vanishes nowhere, i.e. for every x ∈ X there exists an fx ∈ F with fx(x) 6= 0.

Then F is separating for measures in MF (X), i.e.

(3)

µ1, µ2 ∈ MF (X),Z f dµ1 =Z f dµ2 ∀ f ∈ F

=⇒ µ1 = µ2.

Proof. Assume that µ1, µ2 ∈ MF (X) are such that R f dµ1 = R f dµ2 holds for all f ∈ F . We

have to show µ1 = µ2. Enumerate F = {fn | n ∈ }. Using Step 1 from the proof of Theorem 2.3,
we may (and do) assume that fn takes values in [0, 1] for all n ∈ . We proceed in two steps: ﬁrst
we show that (3) holds if we assume that instead of (S.3) the following stronger condition holds,

(S.3†) f1(x) 6= 0 for all x ∈ X.

In the second step, we reduce the general case to the one where (S.3†) holds.

Step 1. Assume that (S.3†) holds and deﬁne ι : X → H, x 7→(cid:0)fn(x)(cid:1)n∈

. Then ι is measurable
and injective by assumption (S.2). Because X is a Souslin space, it is an analytic measurable
space ([Coh80, Proposition 8.6.13]) and so is Y := ι(X) ([Coh80, Corollary 8.6.9]). By [Coh80,
Proposition 8.6.2], ι is a Borel isomorphism onto Y , i.e. ι−1 : Y → X is measurable. Therefore,

(4)

µ1 = µ2 ⇐⇒ µ1 ◦ ι−1 = µ2 ◦ ι−1.

Because of (S.3†), every x = (xn)n∈ ∈ Y satisﬁes x1 6= 0. We deﬁne the metric

r(x, y) := |x−1

1 − y−1

1 | +Xn∈

2−n|xn − yn| ∧ 1,

x, y ∈ Y,

which induces on Y the topology inhereted as a subspace of H. Let G := {f ◦ ι−1 | f ∈ F }. We
show that (Y, r) and G satisfy the prerequisites of Theorem 2.3.

G satisﬁes (T.1) because F does by assumption. By construction of ι, G coincides with the set
of restrictions of coordinate projections to Y . Therefore, G induces the topology of Y , i.e. (T.2)
is satisﬁed. An r-bounded set A in Y satisﬁes δ := inf x∈A |x1| > 0, and (T.3) is satisﬁed with
f = f1 ◦ ι−1. Thus we can apply Theorem 2.3 and obtain that G is weak#-convergence determining
and a fortiori separating for measures in M#

G (Y ).

If µ1, µ2 ∈ MF (X), then they integrate f1, and ˆµi := µi ◦ ι−1, i = 1, 2, are boundedly ﬁnite

measures on (Y, r). Thus obviously ˆµi ∈ M#
Step 2. Now consider the general case, where (S.3†) does not necessarily hold. Deﬁne

G (Y ) and the claim of the theorem follows with (4).

and let F ′ be the set of ﬁnite products of elements of F ∪ {f0}. Then F ′ is a countable set of
measurable functions satisfying (S.1), (S.2) and, because F vanishes nowhere, also (S.3†) (with f1
replaced by f0 ∈ F ′). Hence, by Step 1, F ′ is separating for measures in MF ′(X).

According to the monotone convergence theorem, we have

Z f0 dµ1 =Z f0 dµ2 ≤ 1.

Because every element of F ′ is dominated by an element of F ∪ {f0} (recall that elements of F ′
map to [0, 1]), this implies µ1, µ2 ∈ MF ′(X). Moreover, dominated convergence yields

Z g dµ1 =Z g dµ2 ∀g ∈ F ′,

which implies µ1 = µ2 by Step 1.

In the case of continuous functions, we can drop the countability of F .

Corollary 2.8 (Separation of boundedly ﬁnite measures with continuous functions). Let X be
a Souslin space (e.g. a Polish space), and F ⊆ Cb(X). Assume (S.1), (S.2), and (S.3) from
Theorem 2.7. Then F is separating for measures in MF (X), i.e. (3) holds.

Proof. For x ∈ X, let fx be as in (S.3). There is an open neighbourhood Ux of x with fx(y) 6= 0
for all y ∈ Ux. Because every Souslin space is Lindel¨of (the Lindel¨of property is preserved by
continuous maps), (Ux)x∈X has a countable sub-cover. Hence there exists a countable sub-family
F1 of F satisfying (S.3).

Similarly, for x, y ∈ X let fxy ∈ F be such that fxy(x) 6= fxy(y). Then there is an open
neighbourhood Uxy of (x, y) in X 2 with fxy(u) 6= fxy(v) for all (u, v) ∈ Ux,y. Because X 2 is
also Souslin and hence Lindel¨of, we ﬁnd a countable sub-family F2 of F satisfying (S.2). Let F ′
be the closure of F1 ∪ F2 under multiplication and complex conjugation. Then F ′ satisﬁes the
prerequisites of Theorem 2.7 and the conclusion follows.

Hence C and b are unique.

(6) Fu(x) := exp(iutx) − 1,

ψu(x) := iutx1|x|≤1,

Gu(x) := Fu(x) − ψu(x), x ∈ R

D

and consider the following two classes of functions, where span denotes the linear span:

G := span{Gu | u ∈ R

D},

F := span{Fu · Fv | u, v ∈ R

D}.

Then with (5) and the uniqueness of b and C from Step 1, we have R G dµ1 = R G dµ2 for all

G ∈ G. Now observe that, using linearity of u 7→ ψu(x) for every x ∈ R

D,

Fu · Fv = Fu+v − Fu − Fv = Gu+v − Gu − Gv ∈ G

∀u, v ∈ R

D.

Hence, F is multiplicatively closed (by the ﬁrst equality) and F ⊆ G. In particular, (S.1) holds,

Z f dµ1 =Z f dµ2

∀f ∈ F ,

and µ1, µ2 ∈ M#
and (S.2) and (S.3) are easily veriﬁed. Thus µ1 = µ2 follows from Corollary 2.8.

F , because functions from G are integrable. Furthermore, F is contained in Cb(X)

Now we show the convergence result.

Step 3. First, Ψn(u) = log E[exp(iutZn)] → Ψ(u) pointwise since x 7→ exp(iutx) is a bounded
continuous function.

Step 4. Recall that for the L´evy-triple (b, C, µ) the linear part b depends on the choice of the

w#
−−→ µ we may choose any
compensation function ψu, but C and µ do not. So in order to show µn
(admissible) ψu we like. Replace ψu in (6) by ˆψu(x) = iutxh(x) for a C1-function h : R
D → R with
h(0) = 1 and compact support. Then the argument from above still works: F is multiplicatively
closed and F ⊂ Cb(X), so (T.1) holds.

Moreover, Assumption (T.2) holds by the fact that Fu(xn) → Fu(x) ⇔ exp(iutxn) → exp(iutx)
D. The latter is nothing else than the convergence of the characteristic function of

for all u ∈ R
the measures δ(xn) to δ(x). But this implies that xn → x in R

D, so (T.2) holds.

3.2 Example 2: L´evy-Khintchine formula on Mf (E)

Let E be a Polish space and Mf (E) denote the ﬁnite measures on E. Suppose that Z takes
values in ﬁnite measures on E (E = {1, . . . , D} is a special case of Example 1 if we restrict

3 EXAMPLES

8

to nonnegative random variables there) and that Z is inﬁnitely divisible. Then, under the as-
sumption that E[Z(E)] < ∞, Theorem 6.1 of [Kal83] states that there exists b ∈ Mf (E) and
µ ∈ M#(Mf (E) \ {0}) such that

(7) L(φ) := − log E[exp(−hφ, Zi)] = hφ, bi +Z 1 − exp(−hφ, νi) µ(dν), φ ∈ Cb(cid:0)E, [0, ∞)(cid:1),
where the set Cb(cid:0)E, [0, ∞)(cid:1) denotes the nonnegative, bounded, continuous functions on E. We use

the metric space (X, d) = (Mf (E) \ {0}, d) with

d(ν, ν′) = dProhorov(ν, ν′) + |ν(E)−1 − ν′(E)−1|

for the deﬁnition of M#(X). The uniqueness of the pair (b, µ) in the L´evy-Khintchine formula in
(7) can be shown with our methodology.

Proposition 3.3. The pair (b, µ) ∈ Mf (E) × M#(Mf (E) \ {0}) in (7) is unique.
Proof. Step 1. First, b can be identiﬁed via hb, φi = limm→∞
Step 2. To identify µ we want to use Corollary 2.8. Since (X, d) is a Polish space it is also a
Souslin space. Deﬁne for φ ∈ Cb(E, [0, ∞)) the function Fφ : X → [0, 1] via

1
m L(mφ).

Fφ(ν) = 1 − exp(−hφ, νi), ν ∈ X.

The linear span of functions of this kind is deﬁned

F := span{Fφ | φ ∈ Cb(E, [0, ∞))}.

Then it is easy to see that F ⊂ Cb(X).
Step 3. Now we want to verify the remaining conditions of Corollary 2.8. (S.1) holds since F
are real-valued functions and Fφ · Fψ = Fφ+ψ − Fφ − Fψ for φ, ψ ∈ Cb(E, [0, ∞)). (S.2) and (S.3)
trivially hold. So we can apply the corollary and deduce the uniqueness of µ.

Remark 3.4. The previous proof also works with Theorem 2.3 and thus allows to deduce a result
on the convergence of the characteristics for sequences of inﬁnitely divisible random measures. ♣

3.3 Example 3: Excursion measure of Brownian motion

Let Px ∈ M1(cid:0)C(R+, R)(cid:1) be the law of a 1-dimensional Brownian motion started in x ∈ R and

denote the canonical process by (Bt)t≥0. Let T0 := inf{t > 0 : Bt = 0} be the ﬁrst hitting time
of the origin 0. It is a folklore fact that the measure µn := nP1/n((Bt∧T0 )t≥0 ∈ ·) converges, as
n → ∞, to the Itˆo excursion measure µexc of the reﬂected Brownian motion (|Bt|)t≥0. There are
several ways to deﬁne µexc. We use the characterisation given in Theorem XII.4.2 of [RY99] (where
µexc = 2n+ for n+ used in [RY99]) as deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 3.5 (Brownian excursion measure µexc). Let X ′ := C(R+; R+) be equipped with the
topology of uniform convergence on compacta. For r > 0, let νr ∈ M1(X ′) be the law of a
3-dimensional Bessel bridge of length r. Deﬁne

µexc :=ZR+

νr κ(r) dr

for

κ(r) := (2πr3)−1/2.

Then the σ-ﬁnite measure µexc on X ′ is called Brownian excursion measure.

♦

Since µexc is obviously not a ﬁnite measure, we have to be more precise about what we mean
by convergence of µn to µexc. In Theorem 1 of [Hut09] it is shown (for a more general class of

diﬀusions) that R F dµn →R F dµ holds for every F ∈ Cb(X ′) with the property that there is an

ε > 0 with F (e) = 0 whenever kek∞ < ε. This looks very much like weak#-convergence where the
zero function is sent inﬁnitely far away. This is, however, not precisely the case, because the map
e 7→ kek∞ is not continuous w.r.t. uniform convergence on compacta.

In this subsection we give a setup, where we can apply Theorem 2.3 to obtain a weak#-
w#
−−→ µexc. To this end, we have to modify the topology on (a subspace of) X ′

convergence µn

3 EXAMPLES

in two ways. First, we weaken uniform convergence on compacta to convergence in Lebesgue
measure, because the latter is induced by “nice” functions and therefore much easier to handle in
our framework. This, of course, substantially weakens our result, which will essentially (but not
precisely) be weaker than the one in [Hut09]. Second, we strengthen the topology (and therefore
our result) a bit by requiring convergence of excursion lengths for the convergence of excursions.
This allows us to send the zero function inﬁnitely far away by a continuous function.

Deﬁnition 3.6 (Our excursion space). Deﬁne the excursion length ζ : X ′ → [0, ∞] by

ζ(e) = sup{t > 0 | e(t) 6= 0} ∪ {0},

the space of excursions X := ζ−1(cid:0)(0, ∞)(cid:1), and the metric

d(e, ˆe) =(cid:16)Z ∞

0

|e(t) − ˆe(t)| ∧ 1 dt(cid:17) ∧ 1 +(cid:12)(cid:12)ζ(e)−1 − ζ(ˆe)−1(cid:12)(cid:12)

on X.

♦

The topology induced by d on X is the Meyer-Zheng topology (or pseudo-path topology)

introduced in [MZ84] plus convergence of excursion lengths as we show in Lemma 3.8.

Deﬁnition 3.7 (Meyer-Zheng topology). Let λ be the probability measure on R+ with Lebesgue-
density t 7→ e−t, and en, e : R+ → R+ measurable. Then en is said to converge to e in Meyer-Zheng
topology if the image measures of λ under en converge weakly to the one under e.
♦

Lemma 3.8 (The topology induced by d). Let en, e ∈ X. Then the following are equivalent:

1. en → e with respect to d.

2. en converges to e in Lebesgue-measure, and ζ(en) → ζ(e).

3. en converges to e in Meyer-Zheng topology, and ζ(en) → ζ(e).

In particular, (X, d) is a separable metric space.

Proof. For the “in particular” note that separability of convergence in Lebesgue-measure is well-
known and carries over to d-convergence by the ﬁrst equivalence.

1⇔2: Since ζ(e) ∈ (0, ∞) for all e ∈ X, we have that (cid:12)(cid:12)ζ(e)−1 − ζ(ˆe)−1(cid:12)(cid:12) → 0 is equivalent to
It is well-known that dLeb(e, ˆe) = R |e(t) − ˆe(t)| ∧ 1 dt induces convergence in

ζ(en) → ζ(e).
Lebesgue-measure (e.g. [Bog07, Exercise 4.7.61]), so the same is true for dLeb ∧ 1.
3⇔2: In [MZ84, Lemma 1] it is shown that Meyer-Zheng topology coincides with convergence in
λ-measure. Now ζ(en) → ζ(e) implies M := supn∈ ζ(en) < ∞, and λ is equivalent to Lebesgue-
measure on [0, M ].

Theorem 3.9 (Brownian excursion measure). Let (X, d) be the excursion space introduced in

Deﬁnition 3.6, µexc the Brownian excursion measure, and bB = (bBt)t≥0 Brownian motion killed in

0. In M#(X),

Deﬁnition 3.10 (F ). Let F be the multiplicative closure of F ′.

Lemma 3.11. F is weak#-convergence determining for measures in M#

F (X).

Proof. F obviously satisﬁes (T.1) and (T.3). Indeed, F is multiplicatively closed by deﬁnition, and
A ⊆ X is d-bounded if and only if inf e∈A ζ(e) > 0. Once we have shown (T.2), i.e. that F induces
the same topology as d, the claim follows from Theorem 2.3. To this end, note that ζ(en) → ζ(e)
is necessary for both d- and F -convergence, and recall that under this condition, by Lemma 3.8,
d-convergence is equivalent to

3.4 Example 4: Mass fragmentations

Consider the set

S↓ =ns = (s1, s2, . . . ) ∈ [0, 1](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Xi≥1

si ≤ 1, s1 ≥ s2 ≥ s3 ≥ · · · ≥ 0o

of decreasing sequences (s1, s2, . . . ) with sum less than 1. This set is used to model (mass) frag-
mentation processes. A perfect introduction to the topic is given in Bertoin’s book [Ber06]. In
his Section 2.1, the set S↓ is introduced and endowed with the topology of pointwise convergence.
Our goal is to present two sets of real-valued convergence-determining functions on S↓, namely

G1 =nS↓ ∋ s = (s1, s2, . . . ) 7→ Gp(s) =Xi≥1
G2 =nS↓ ∋ s = (s1, s2, . . . ) 7→ Hα(s) =Xi≥1

sp

i (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) p ∈ o,
(1 − e−αsi )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) α > 0o.

Theorem 3.12. The sets G1 and G2 are convergence-determining on S↓ in the sense that for
s(n), s ∈ S↓, n ∈  the following holds for j = 1, 2:

G(s(n)) n→∞−−−−→ G(s) ∀G ∈ Gj

=⇒ s(n) n→∞−−−−→ s.

Before we give the proof, we relate the set S↓ to boundedly ﬁnite measures. Therefore, let

Consider the mapping

X = (0, 1] with metric d(x, y) =(cid:12)(cid:12)x−1 − y−1(cid:12)(cid:12).
Φ :(S↓

Lemma 3.13. The mapping Φ is a homeomorphism from S↓ to Φ(S↓).
Proof. Step 1. The mapping Φ is injective: For s ∈ S↓, all si, i ≥ 1 can be easily reconstructed.
Step 2. The mapping Φ is continuous: Let s(n), s ∈ S↓ with s(n) → s. If A is a bounded set in X
w.r.t. d with Φ(s)(∂A) = 0, then it is clear that Φ(s(n))(A) → Φ(s)(A) and we can use Proposition
A.2.6.II (d) in [DVJ03].
Step 3. The mapping Φ−1|Φ(S↓) is continuous: Suppose Φ(s(n)) w#
z 6∈ {si | i ∈ }. Then we have Φ(s(n))|[z,1]
s on those coordinates that lie in [z, 1]. Since we may choose z arbitrarily small, this suﬃces.

−−→ Φ(s). Fix z ∈ (0, 1) with
w
−→ Φ(s)|[z,1]. But this implies convergence of s(n) to

3 EXAMPLES

Proof of Theorem 3.12. We only provide the proof for G1, since the other proof is similar.
Step 1. Note that we can write

Thus, G(s(n)) → G(s) ∀G ∈ G1 can be written as

Gp(s) =Z xp Φ(s)(dx), p ∈ .
Z xp Φ(s(n))(dx) →Z xp Φ(s)(dx), p ∈ .

We use Theorem 2.3 to show that Φ(s(n)) w#
−−→ Φ(s) and this suﬃces for s(n) → s by Lemma 3.13.
Step 2. Of course (X, d) as before Lemma 3.13 is a separable metric space. Moreover, the class
F = span{x 7→ xp | p ∈ } ⊂ Cb(X) of polynomials without constant term on X satisﬁes the
prerequisites of Theorem 2.3, which is easy to check. Finally, Φ(s) ∈ M#
F (X) for all s ∈ S↓ since
for all p ∈ :

Z xp Φ(s)(dx) ≤Z x Φ(s)(dx) =Xi≥1

si ≤ 1 < ∞.

Thus, Theorem 2.3 applies and yields the claim.

Remark 3.14. Note that G1 6⊂ C(S↓):
G1(s(n)) = 1 6→ 0 = G1(0).

for si(n) = n−1

11≤i≤n, i ∈ , we have s(n) → 0, but
♣

The stronger statement than Theorem 3.12 including the continuity holds on the subset of

decreasing sequences summing up to 1.
Corollary 3.15. On the subset S↓
the topology of pointwise convergence.

1 = {s ∈ S↓ |Pi≥1 si = 1}, the set of functions G1 generates

Proof. First, the subset is a Polish space with the relative topology since it is a Gδ-subset of S↓.

Let s(n), s ∈ S↓

1 , n ∈ .

Step 1. First suppose that s(n) → s as n → ∞. We can use an approximation argument to get

G(s(n)) → G(s) for all G ∈ G1: Let ε > 0. Fix z > 0 s.t.Pi≥1 si1si≤z < ε and si 6= z for all i ≥ 1.

By Proposition A.2.6.II (d) from [DVJ03] and our Proposition 3.13, we may choose n so large that
Φ(s(n))|[z,1] and Φ(s)|[z,1] are very close in the following sense:

Use that in the following equation

si(n)q

sup

q∈{1,p}(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Xi≥1
Gp(s(n)) =Xi≥1

1si(n)>z −Xi≥1

1si(n)≤z.

Once we establish that the last term is small, we see that Gp(s(n)) → Gp(s). But the last term is
bounded by:

si(n)p

Xi≥1

1si(n)≤z ≤Xi≥1

si(n)1si(n)≤z = 1 −Xi≥1

Note that it was crucial to know thatPi≥1 si = 1 in the last proof.

Step 2. The converse direction was established in Theorem 3.12.

si(n)1si(n)>z ≤ 1 − (1 − ε) = ε.

Remark 3.16. An application in a similar spirit is given in [GGR], where X is the set of ultrametric
measure spaces with diameter in [0, 2h) for certain h > 0. Any ultrametric measure space with
diameter in [0, 2h] can be written as a boundedly ﬁnite measure on X (in a unique way similar to
♣
a prime factorization). This relation can be used for a result analogous to Corollary 3.15.
