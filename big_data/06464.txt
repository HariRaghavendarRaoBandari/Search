A NOTE ON CENTRAL SUBALGEBRAS OF COMPACT

QUANTUM GROUPS

MAHMOOD ALAGHMANDAN AND JASON CRANN

Abstract. We investigate quantum group generalizations of various results
from Fourier analysis on compact groups. In particular, we characterize the
ﬁxed points of the conjugation actions on L2(G), and use these characteriza-
tions to partially answer an open question of Woronowicz [14]. At the level of
L1(G), we show that the center Z(L1(G)) is precisely the closed linear span
of the characters for a large class of compact quantum groups, including arbi-
trary compact Kac algebras. In the latter setting, we show, in addition, that
Z(L1(G)) is a completely complemented Z(L1(G))-submodule of L1(G).

1. Introduction

As in the group setting, irreducible characters play a signiﬁcant role in harmonic
analysis on compact quantum groups [1, 3, 4, 14].
In this note, we investigate
the relationship between the irreducible characters of compact quantum groups G
and the central subalgebras of the Banach algebras L2(G) and L1(G). Contrary
to the group setting, for general G there are potentially two distinct conjugation
actions on L2(G). We characterize their ﬁxed points as the closed linear span of the
characters and quantum characters, respectively, the latter being equal to the center
Z(L2(G)). We then use these characterizations to establish the density of characters
in ZC(G) := {x ∈ C(G) | Γ(x) = ΣΓ(x)}, thereby partially answering an open
question Woronowicz (see [14, Proposition 5.11]), generalizing the partial solution
of Lemeux in the Kac setting [9, Theorem 1.4]. For any compact quantum group
whose dual has the central almost completely positive approximation property in
the sense of [4, Deﬁniton 3], we show that Z(L1(G)) is the closed linear span of
the characters. We establish the same result for arbitrary compact Kac algebras
by showing that Z(L1(G)) is a completely complemented Z(L1(G))-submodule of
L1(G).

2. Compact quantum groups

A locally compact quantum group is a quadruple G = (L∞(G), Γ, ϕ, ψ), where
L∞(G) is a Hopf-von Neumann algebra with a co-associative co-multiplication
Γ : L∞(G) → L∞(G)⊗L∞(G), and ϕ and ψ are ﬁxed (normal faithful semiﬁ-
nite) left and right Haar weights on L∞(G), respectively [7, 8]. For every lo-
cally compact quantum group G there exists a left fundamental unitary opera-
tor W on L2(G, ϕ) ⊗ L2(G, ϕ) and a right fundamental unitary operator V on
L2(G, ψ) ⊗ L2(G, ψ) implementing the co-multiplication Γ via

Γ(x) = W ∗(1 ⊗ x)W = V (x ⊗ 1)V ∗,

x ∈ L∞(G).

Both unitaries satisfy the pentagonal relation; that is,

(2.1)

W12W13W23 = W23W12

and

V12V13V23 = V23V12.

At the level of the Hilbert spaces,
W ∗Λϕ⊗ϕ(x ⊗ y) = Λϕ⊗ϕ(Γ(y)(x ⊗ 1)) and V Λψ⊗ψ(a ⊗ b) = Λψ⊗ψ(Γ(a)(1 ⊗ b))
for x, y ∈ Nϕ and a, b ∈ Nψ. By [8, Proposition 2.11], we may identify L2(G, ϕ)
and L2(G, ψ), so we will simply use L2(G) for this Hilbert space throughout the
paper. The reduced quantum group C∗-algebra of L∞(G) is deﬁned as

C0(G) := {(id ⊗ ω)(W ) | ω ∈ T (L2(G))}

k·k

.

We say that G is compact if C0(G) is a unital C∗-algebra, in which case we denote
C0(G) by C(G). For compact quantum groups it follows that ϕ is ﬁnite and right
invariant. In particular, ϕ = ψ.

We let R and (τt)t∈R denote the unitary antipode and scaling group of G, re-

spectively. The unitary antipode satisﬁes

(2.2)

(R ⊗ R) ◦ Γ = Σ ◦ Γ ◦ R.

The antipode of G is S = Rτ− i
whose domain we denote by D(S).

, and is a closed densely deﬁned operator on L∞(G),

Let L1(G) denote the predual of L∞(G). Then the pre-adjoint of Γ induces an

associative completely contractive multiplication on L1(G), deﬁned by

⋆ : L1(G)b⊗L1(G) ∋ f ⊗ g 7→ f ⋆ g = Γ∗(f ⊗ g) ∈ L1(G).

There is a canonical L1(G)-bimodule structure on L∞(G), given by

hf ⋆ x, gi = hx, g ⋆ f i and hx ⋆ f, gi = hx, f ⋆ gi,

x ∈ L∞(G), f, g ∈ L1(G).

We say that G is co-amenable if L1(G) has a bounded left (equivalently, right or
two-sided) approximate identity (cf. [2, Theorem 3.1]).

Let L1

∗(G) be the subspace of L1(G) deﬁned by

L1

∗(G) = {f ∈ L1(G) : ∃ g ∈ L1(G)

s.t.

g(x) = f ∗ ◦ S(x) ∀x ∈ D(S)},

where f ∗(x) = f (x∗), x ∈ L∞(G). It is known from [13, §1.13] that L1
subalgebra of L1(G). There is an involution on L1
that L1

∗(G) is a dense
∗(G) given by f o = f ∗ ◦ S, such
∗(G) becomes a Banach *-algebra under the norm kf k∗ = max{kf k, kf ok}.
A unitary co-representation of G is a unitary U ∈ L∞(G)⊗B(H) satisfying
(Γ⊗id)(U ) = U13U23. Every unitary co-representation gives rise to a representation
of L1(G) via

L1(G) ∋ f 7→ (f ⊗ id)(U ) ∈ B(H).

In particular, the left fundamental unitary W gives rise to the left regular repre-
sentation λ : L1(G) → B(L2(G)) deﬁned by λ(f ) = (f ⊗ id)(W ), f ∈ L1(G), which
is an injective, completely contractive homomorphism from L1(G) into B(L2(G)).

Then L∞(bG) := {λ(f ) : f ∈ L1(G)}′′ is the von Neumann algebra associated
with the dual quantum group bG of G. When G is compact with normalized Haar

state ϕ, the following holds [14]: every irreducible co-representation uα is ﬁnite-
dimensional and is unitarily equivalent to a sub-representation of W , and every
unitary co-representation of G can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible
representations. We let Irr(G) := {uα} denote a complete set of representatives
of irreducible co-representations of G which are pairwise inequivalent. Slicing by

Then Iϕ is a dense left ideal in L1(G) containing L∞(G) · ϕ such that for every
f ∈ Iϕ, there exists a unique a(f ) ∈ L2(G) satisfying ha(f ), Λϕ(x)i = hf, x∗i
for all x ∈ L∞(G).
It is known that
Λϕ(x) ⊗ Λϕ(y) 7→ a((x · ϕ) ⋆ (y · ϕ)) yields the canonical Banach algebra structure on
L2(G) and that there exists a contractive homomorphic injection b : L2(G) → L1(G)
satisfying b(a(f )) = f for all f ∈ Iϕ.

If x ∈ L∞(G), then a(x · ϕ) = Λϕ(x).

As in the case of compact groups, the irreducible characters of G play an impor-

tant role in the harmonic analysis. For α ∈ Irr(G), we let

be the quantum character of α. The characters (as well as the quantum characters)
satisfy the decomposition relations:

N γ

αβχγ,

where N γ
αβ is the multiplicity of γ in the tensor product representation α ⊗ β (see
[11, Proposition 1.4.3]). It follows that χα = χα∗

α ∈ Irr(G)} is a C∗-subalgebra of C(G). Letting ϕα
q ·ϕ be the L1(G) elements
q := χα
corresponding to the quantum characters of G, it follows from the orthogonality
relations that

By weak* density of A in L∞(G) it follows that alg{ϕα
q | α ∈ Irr(G)} is a closed
ideal in Z(L1(G)), the center of L1(G). Below we establish the reverse inclusion
for a large class of compact quantum groups.

From the Peter–Weyl relations one easily sees that

hΛϕ(χα), Λϕ(χβ)i = δαβ = hΛϕ(χα

q ), Λϕ(χβ

q )i, α, β ∈ Irr(G),

so spatially, there is no diﬀerence between the subspaces of L2(G) generated by
{Λϕ(χα)} and {Λϕ(χα
q )}. The multiplicative structure of these spaces is quite
diﬀerent, however, as we now investigate.

3. Central Subalgebras

Let G be a compact quantum group, and let β2 : L1(G) → B(L2(G)) be the

conjugate representation of G, deﬁned by

β2(f ) = (f ⊗ id)(W (1 ⊗ U ∗)W (1 ⊗ U )),

f ∈ L1(G),

where U = bJ J, and J and bJ are the conjugate linear isometries arising from the
GNS constructions of ϕ and bϕ, respectively. One can easily verify that

W (1 ⊗ U ∗)W (1 ⊗ U ) ∈ L∞(G)⊗B(L2(G))

is a unitary co-representation of G, so that β2 is indeed a homomorphism. Let
ZL2(G) denote the set of ﬁxed vectors under β2, i.e., those ξ ∈ L2(G) satisfying
β2(f )ξ = hf, 1iξ for all f ∈ L1(G). We call ZL2(G) the space of central vectors of
L2(G), and in what follows we study its connection to the center Z(L2(G)). We
begin with a few lemmas.

Lemma 3.1. Let G be a compact quantum group. Then for x ∈ A,

β2(ϕ)Λϕ(x) =

This establishes the ﬁrst formula. The second follows from the general relation

veriﬁed.

Lemma 3.2. Let G be a compact quantum group, and x ∈ A. Then x · ϕ ∈ L1
with (x · ϕ)o = S(x)∗ · ϕ.

Proof. First note that ϕ = ϕ ◦ S on D(S). Then for y ∈ D(S) we have

hS(x)∗ · ϕ, yi = ϕ(yS(x)∗) = ϕ(S(x)y∗) = ϕ(S(x)S(S(y)∗))

= ϕ(S(S(y)∗x)) = ϕ(S(y)∗x) = hx · ϕ, S(y)∗i.

Thus, x · ϕ ∈ L1

∗(G) with (x · ϕ)o = S(x)∗ · ϕ.

Lemma 3.3 implies that β2(ϕ) is a self-adjoint idempotent, so β2(ϕ) is the orthog-

β2(ϕ)Λϕ(χα) = Λϕ(χα) for all α ∈ Irr(G) so that span{Λϕ(χα) | α ∈ Irr(G)} ⊆
ZL2(G). Conversely, if ξ ∈ ZL2(G) and hξ, Λϕ(χα)i = 0 for all α, then

precisely Z(L2(G)). Thus, for non-Kac compact quantum groups, the conjugation
representations β2 and β′
2 distinguish the central vectors from the center of the
Banach algebra L2(G).

At the level of C(G), we now show that ZC(G) = {x ∈ C(G) | Γ(x) = ΣΓ(x)} is
precisely the closed linear span of the characters, which partially answers an open
question of Woronowicz (see [14, Proposition 5.11]).

Theorem 3.7. Let G be a compact quantum group. Then

ZC(G) = span{χα | α ∈ Irr(G)}.

Proof. The inclusion span{χα | α ∈ Irr(G)} ⊆ ZC(G) is clear. Let x ∈ ZC(G).
Then for any y ∈ L∞(G)

hβ2(ϕ)Λϕ(x), Λϕ(y∗)i = hW σV σΛϕ⊗ϕ(1 ⊗ x), Λϕ⊗ϕ(1 ⊗ y∗)i

= hΛϕ(x), Λϕ(y∗)i.

It follows that β2(ϕ)Λϕ(x) = Λϕ(x). Hence Λϕ(ZC(G)) ⊆ ZL2(G) by Proposition
3.4, and ZL2(G) = Λϕ(ZC(G))

, as the reverse inclusion is clear.

Note that equations (2.3) and (2.5) entail the traciality of ϕ on the C∗-algebra
In particular, the map ZL2(G) ∋ Λϕ(x) 7→ Λϕ(x∗) ∈
span{χα | α ∈ Irr(G)}.
ZL2(G) is an isometry. Given, x, y ∈ ZC(G), take sequences (xn) and (yn) in
span{χα | α ∈ Irr(G)} such that Λϕ(xn) → Λϕ(x) and Λϕ(yn) → Λϕ(y). Then

Thus, ϕ is a faithful trace on ZC(G), so there is a unique conditional expectation
E : ZC(G) → span{χα | α ∈ Irr(G)} satisfying Λϕ(E(x)) = β2(ϕ)Λϕ(x) = Λϕ(x),
x ∈ ZC(G). Then E(x) = x, and ZC(G) ⊆ span{χα | α ∈ Irr(G)}.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.8. For a compact quantum group G, let Cu(G) be its corresponding
universal C∗-algebra (see [6] for details). There is a universal co-multiplication
Γu : Cu(G) → Cu(G) ⊗min Cu(G) satisfying (π ⊗ π) ◦ Γu = Γ ◦ π, where π : Cu(G) →
C(G) is the canonical quotient map. This gives rise to a universal compact quantum
group structure on Cu(G). In particular, there is a ∗-algebra Au of universal matrix
coeﬃcients which is dense in Cu(G), and there are universal characters χα
u ∈ Cu(G)
satisfying π(χα
u ) = χα, α ∈ Irr(G). In [14], Woronowicz asks whether ZCu(G) ∩ Au
is dense in ZCu(G) = {xu ∈ Cu(G) | Γu(xu) = ΣΓu(xu)}. Theorem 3.7 therefore
answers this question, in the aﬃrmative, for all co-amenable compact quantum
groups, i.e., those for which Cu(G) = C(G) (see [2, Theorem 3.1]). This generalizes
the partial result of Lemeux in the co-amenable Kac setting [9, Theorem 1.4].

For compact groups G, the proof that Z(L1(G)) is the closed linear span of
the characters utilizes a central bounded approximate identity (BAI) for L1(G).
A similar argument applies for any compact quantum group G for which L1(G)
has a BAI (fi) in span{ϕα
q | α ∈ Irr(G)}, which is bounded in the completely
bounded multiplier norm, i.e., the maps L1(G) ∋ g 7→ fi ⋆ g ∈ L1(G) are uniformly
completely bounded. Any G whose dual has the central almost completely positive
approximation property (ACPAP) in the sense of [4, Deﬁniton 3] has this property.
Thus,

(3.3)

Z(L1(G)) = span{ϕα

q | α ∈ Irr(G)}

for any compact G with the central ACPAP. By [4, Theorem 25], this includes
SUq(2), q ∈ [−1, 0) ∪ (0, 1], as well as any free orthogonal and unitary quantum
groups O+
F , for any parameter matrix F ∈ GL(n, C) (see [4, §1.4,§4.2], for
instance). We conjecture that (3.3) is valid for arbitrary compact G, and we now
provide support for the conjecture by showing that it holds for arbitrary compact
Kac algebras. In turn, we generalize a result of Mosak [10, Proposition 1.5 (i)].

F and U +

Theorem 3.9. Let G be a compact Kac algebra. Then β2(ϕ) : L2(G) → L2(G)
extends to a completely contractive projection β1 : L1(G) → Z(L1(G)) satisfying

β1(f ⋆ g) = f ⋆ β1(g),

f ∈ Z(L1(G)), g ∈ L1(G).

Proof. The argument in [12, Lemma 3.2] shows that the map Φ : L∞(G)⊗L∞(G) →
L∞(G) given by

Φ(X) = (ωΛϕ(1) ⊗ id)W ∗(U ∗ ⊗ 1)X(U ⊗ 1)W, X ∈ L∞(G)⊗L∞(G)

is a normal, unital, completely positive left inverse to Γ satisfying Γ ◦ Φ = (Φ ⊗

id)(id ⊗ Γ). Moreover, since W ∈ L∞(G)⊗L∞(bG) and U Λϕ(1) = Λϕ(1), we have

ϕ(Φ(x ⊗ y)) = (ωΛϕ(1) ⊗ ϕ)((U ∗xU ⊗ 1)W ∗(1 ⊗ y)W ) = ϕ(x)ϕ(y)

for all x, y ∈ L∞(G). By normality it follows that ϕ ⊗ ϕ = ϕ ◦ Φ = ϕ ⊗ ϕ ◦ Γ ◦ Φ,
so that Γ ◦ Φ is a normal conditional expectation onto Γ(L∞(G)) preserving ϕ ⊗ ϕ.
By Lemma 3.1, the map b ◦ β2(ϕ) ◦ a : Iϕ → L1(G) satisﬁes b ◦ β2(ϕ) ◦ a(x · ϕ) =
i=1 xi ⊗ yi. Recalling that ϕ is

Pn
i=1(yi · ϕ) ⋆ (xi · ϕ) for x ∈ A, where Γ(x) = Pn

invariant under the unitary antipode, for y ∈ L∞(G) we have

hb ◦ β2(ϕ) ◦ a(x · ϕ), yi =

=

h(yi · ϕ) ⋆ (xi · ϕ), yi =

nX

i=1

h(yi · ϕ) ⊗ (xi · ϕ), Γ(y)i

ϕ ⊗ ϕ(Γ(y)(yi ⊗ xi)) = ϕ ⊗ ϕ(Γ(y)ΣΓ(x))

= ϕ ⊗ ϕ(Γ(R(x))(R ⊗ R)(Γ(y)))

= ϕ ⊗ ϕ(Γ ◦ Φ(Γ(R(x))(R ⊗ R)(Γ(y))))

= ϕ ⊗ ϕ(Γ(R(x))Γ ◦ Φ((R ⊗ R)(Γ(y))))

= ϕ ⊗ ϕ(Γ(R(x)Φ((R ⊗ R)(Γ(y)))))

= ϕ(R(x)Φ((R ⊗ R)(Γ(y))))

= ϕ(R(Φ((R ⊗ R)(Γ(y))))x)

= hx · ϕ, R ◦ Φ ◦ (R ⊗ R) ◦ Γ(y)i.

Since the span{x · ϕ | x ∈ A} is dense in L1(G), it follows that the map b ◦ β2(ϕ) ◦ a
has a completely contractive extension to a map β1 : L1(G) → L1(G) whose adjoint
1 (y) = R ◦ Φ ◦ (R ⊗ R) ◦ Γ(y) for y ∈ L∞(G).
1 : L∞(G) → L∞(G) is given by β∗
β∗
Moreover, since β2(ϕ)a(x·ϕ) = ab(β2(ϕ)a(x·ϕ)) for x ∈ A, and β2(ϕ) is idempotent,
we have

β1(x · ϕ) = bβ2(ϕ)β2(ϕ)a(x · ϕ) = bβ2(ϕ)a ◦ bβ2(ϕ)a(x · ϕ) = β1 ◦ β1(x · ϕ)

which, by density, implies that β1 is also idempotent.

To establish the module property, ﬁx g ∈ L1(G) and f ∈ Z(L1(G)). Then

R ⊗ R(Γ(f ⋆ x)) = R ⊗ R(Γ((id ⊗ f )Γ(x)))

= R ⊗ R((id ⊗ id ⊗ f )(Γ ⊗ id)(Γ(x)))

= (id ⊗ id ⊗ f )((R ⊗ R)(Γ ⊗ id)(Γ(x))

= (id ⊗ id ⊗ f )(ΣΓ ⊗ id)(R ⊗ id)(Γ(x))
= (id ⊗ id ⊗ R∗(f ))(ΣΓ ⊗ id)(R ⊗ R)(Γ(x))
= (id ⊗ id ⊗ R∗(f ))(ΣΓ ⊗ id)(ΣΓ(R(x)))
= (id ⊗ id ⊗ R∗(f ))(id ⊗ ΣΓ)(ΣΓ(R(x)))

(equation (2.2))

(co-associativity)

= (id ⊗ id ⊗ R∗(f ))(id ⊗ Γ)(ΣΓ(R(x)))

(f ∈ Z(L1(G))).

MAHMOOD ALAGHMANDAN AND JASON CRANN

Applying the map Φ, we obtain

Φ(R ⊗ R(Γ(f ⋆ x))) = (id ⊗ R∗(f ))(Φ ⊗ id)(id ⊗ Γ)(ΣΓ(R(x)))

= (id ⊗ R∗(f ))Γ(Φ(ΣΓ(R(x))))
= (id ⊗ R∗(f ))Γ(Φ(R ⊗ R(Γ(x))))
= R∗(f ) ⋆ Φ(R ⊗ R(Γ(x))).

Therefore

R ◦ Φ ◦ (R ⊗ R) ◦ Γ(f ⋆ x) = R ◦ Φ ◦ (R ⊗ R) ◦ Γ(x) ⋆ f = f ⋆ R ◦ Φ ◦ (R ⊗ R) ◦ Γ(x)

as f is central. The pre-adjoint of the above relation yields the desired module
property.

Now, let f ∈ L1(G). Taking a sequence (Λϕ(xn)) in L2(G) such that b(Λϕ(xn))

converges to f , it follows that β1(b(Λϕ(xn))) converges to β1(f ). But β1(b(Λϕ(xn))) =
b(β2(ϕ)Λϕ(xn)) ∈ b(Z(L2(G))), so that β1(f ) ∈ b(Z(L2(G))), which, by Proposi-
tion 3.5, is contained in span{ϕα | α ∈ Irr(G)} ⊆ Z(L1(G)).

Conversely, let f ∈ Z(L1(G)). By Proposition 3.4 we have β1(ϕα) = ϕα for all

α ∈ Irr(G), so the module property of β1 entails

β1(f ) ⋆ ϕα = β1(f ⋆ ϕα) = f ⋆ β1(ϕα) = f ⋆ ϕα, α ∈ Irr(G).

Hence, by Lemma 3.3, for every ξ ∈ L2(G),

λ(f )ξ = X

dαλ(f ⋆ ϕα)ξ = X

α∈Irr(G)

α∈Irr(G)

dαλ(β1(f ) ⋆ ϕα)ξ = λ(β1(f ))ξ.

By injectivity of λ we then get f = β1(f ) so that Z(L1(G)) = β1(L1(G)).

(cid:3)

The following corollary is immediate from the proof of Theorem 3.9.

Corollary 3.10. Let G be a compact Kac algebra. Then

Z(L1(G)) = span{ϕα | α ∈ Irr(G)}.
