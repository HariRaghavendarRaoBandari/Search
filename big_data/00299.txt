Surprises in numerical expressions of physical constants

Ariel Amir, Mikhail Lemeshko, Tadashi Tokieda

Abstract

In science, as in life, ‘surprises’ can be adequately appreciated only in the presence of
In physics, theories sometimes express the values
a null model, what we expect a priori.
of dimensionless physical constants as combinations of mathematical constants like π or e.
The inverse problem also arises, whereby the measured value of a physical constant admits
a ‘surprisingly’ simple approximation in terms of well-known mathematical constants. Can
we estimate the probability for this to be a mere coincidence, rather than an inkling of some
theory? We answer the question in the most naive form.

How do we react to the observation that the ratio of the proton mass to the electron mass equals

6π5? This was the content of [3], reprinted here in full.

The parvum opus breathed new life into the ancient ﬁeld of applied numerology in fundamental
physics (e.g. [5], [6], [4]; see also an interesting paper [1]), besides adding a 3rd Lenz to the history
of physics (after Heinrich, of induced currents, and Wilhelm, of the conserved vector). As of 2015
the most exact value of the proton-to-electron mass ratio is 1836.15267245(75) according to the
National Institute of Standards and Technology [7], which still coincides with 6π5 = 1836.1181···
to 5 signiﬁcant ﬁgures. How surprising is it that a dimensionless physical constant coincides to such
an accuracy with a simple expression built up from well-known mathematical constants?

Occasionally, a coincidence is no mere ﬂuke, but rather signals a consequence of some (perhaps
as yet undiscovered) theory. At absolute temperature T , a black body has total emissive power
σT 4, with

σ = 40.802624638··· × k4

(the Stefan-Boltzmann law). The combination of Boltzmann’s constant k, Planck’s constant h,
the speed of light c is imposed by dimensional analysis. But who ordered the funny prefactor? It
coincides with 2π5/15 to 7 ﬁgures [7]. On this occasion, there turns out to be a theory due to
Planck, and the apparent coincidence is a theorem:

The question is, how can we distinguish when a signiﬁcant-looking expression for a physical
constant is a ﬂuke, versus when it signals something? Surely the ﬁrst step is to ﬁgure out the
probability that it is a ﬂuke.

Let us adopt a naive model. We call a d-digit number a number of the form

z1z2 ··· zd−1 . zd

i.e. with d − 1 digits in its integer part followed by 1 digit after the decimal point. Thus, 1836.1
is a 5-digit number. We regard an expression Z as a simple expression built up from well-known
mathematical constants when it is of the form

Z = g(f (A, B), C).

We can build 6π5 as g(f (A, B), C) by taking f (x, y) = xy, g(x, y) = x× y, and A = π, B = 5, C = 6.
We generated all expressions Z of the form (*) and, for each d, 1 (cid:54) d (cid:54) 6, counted the proportion

(probability) they occupy in the set of all d-digit numbers.

Figure 1: Histogram of log of all possible expressions generated by (*).

The histogram of Fig. 1 shows the distribution of loge Z. It bears a resemblance to a normal
distribution, which suggests that Z itself has a log-normal distribution. Log-normal distributions
govern the product of many independent positive random variables. Our A, B, C are not quite

we may deem it plausible that a log-normalesque behavior emerges from (*). Some of the deviations
from log-normal are imputable to our having allowed subtraction, division, exponentiation, etc.:
the sharp peak at 0 was caused by these operations which, compared with multiplication, tend to
overproduce e0 = 1; they may also cause Z to be negative, in which case we just shrugged and
plotted Re loge Z. Furthermore, we tested the distribution of the leading digits in our data set:
it followed closely Benford’s law, where z (1 (cid:54) z (cid:54) 9) appears with frequency proportional to
log(z + 1) − log z, e.g. 1 appeared as the leading digit in about 35% of the values of Z and 9 in
about 5%. Benford’s law holds for the leading digits if the log data distribute uniformly across
many orders of magnitude, which is consistent with the log-normal scenario.

The graph of Fig. 2 shows the probability that a randomly chosen d-digit number coincides to
all its digits with one of the values of Z, as we increase d = 1, . . . , 6. The probability begins at 100%
for d = 1, 2, hovers around 86% for d = 3, and tails oﬀ for d > 4. The tail makes heuristic sense.
The number of possible expressions allowed by (*) is 143 × 72 = 105.1···. Therefore d = 5 would give
an upper bound for the 100% coverage if all these expressions were distinct and ﬁtted within the
correct magnitude range. But as witnessed by Fig. 1, Z ≈ 105−1 or equivalently loge Z ≈ 9.2···
is already in the tail of the distribution. In other words, the majority of values of Z overlap and
squeeze into the range of 4 digits, leaving 5- and 6-digit numbers uncovered. More diligently, we
tally about 2000 occurrences between loge 104−1 = 6.9··· and loge 105−1, so that the probability

We ﬁnd that the a priori probability for a 5-digit number like 1836.1 is only 1.2%. So [3] should
surprise us, at least mildly. Conversely, a simple mathematical expression that gives a 3- or 4-digit
dimensionless physical constant need not get us excited.

Expanding the reserve of mathematical constants dramatically raises the coverage; so does it-
erating operations more times. For instance, when we bring in constants named after a bevy of
mathematicians as in [9], the coverage for 5-digit numbers rises to 42%. Nowadays some physicists
use an online tool [10] that mines an immense reserve of constants, in order to solve the inverse
problem of matching the simplest mathematical expression against a given numerical value. How-
ever, it demands a very high-precision knowledge of the constants, and when we input 1836.1, the
tool overlooked 6π5 and returned much more complicated ‘solutions’ such as Y0( 151

10×107 is an even better approximation,
especially in a leap year when the coincidence persists to 5 ﬁgures. Of course, these examples are
disappointing because the numbers depend on the human unit of ‘second’ (whereas ‘day’ and ‘year’
are natural units). See [8] for additional examples.

A dual issue is addressed by the familiar puzzle of the type ‘Can we make n (some number
thrown oﬀ as a challenge) by using just three 2s?’ This particular puzzle has a universal solution,
often attributed to von Neumann [2]: every integer n can be written

x stands for x1/2, though if we denote log2 by lg
The solution milks the notational accident that
as computer scientists do, then we can erase 2 from the base of logarithm and so compensate for
the appearance of 2 in the iterated powers, again getting away with just three 2s.

All three authors contributed equally little to the present study.
