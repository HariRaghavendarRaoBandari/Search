Abstract

There are many viable combinations of texture zeros in lepton mass matrices. We propose an economical

and stable mass texture. Analytical and numerical results on mixing parameters and the eﬀective mass of

neutrinos are obtained. These results satisfy new constraints from neutrinos oscillation experiments and

cosmological observations. Our proposition reveals that in the complex forest of neutrinos mixing models,

a simple and robust one is still possible.

INTRODUCTION

Neutrinos oscillation is one of most mysterious phenomena in particle physics, which reveals
that neutrinos are massive and mixing structure of them are nontrivial. However, how to interpret
the origin of masses and special mixing pattern of neutrinos is still an open question. As useful
phenomenological scenarios, special textures of lepton mass matrices and corresponding ﬂavor
groups are introduced to predict mixing parameters of neutrinos. In particular, lepton mass matri-
ces with texture zeros [1–8] or structures alike [9–12] are widely employed in mixing models of
neutrinos, which can be realized in Abelian or non-Abelian ﬂavor groups, see Refs [13–15] for ex-
ample. As an important progress, the recent Ref[16] has performed a complete survey of possible
combinations of texture zeros in mass matrices of charged leptons and Majorana or Dirac neutri-
nos. There are so many types of possible mass matrices with texture zeros that we don’t know
what is the true texture chosen by nature. In order to evaluate importance of classes of texture ze-
ros, we propose two criteria: First, the mass matrices with texture zeros should be as economical
as possible; Second, predictions of texture-zeros models should be stable under perturbations of
mass matrices. We consider that an economical model of texture zeros can give clear dependences
of observables on parameters of lepton mass matrices. And texture-zeros models with robust pre-
dictions are more sustainable, because they can react to the progress of neutrinos experiments by
introduction small modiﬁcations or perturbations.

In this letter, we propose a special combination of texture zeros of leptons mass matrices with
an economical and stable structure. The mass matrix of charged leptons is Hermitian with Fritzsch
texture [17–19], i.e.,

where Cl is real and Al, Bl are complex parameters. And the mass matrix of Majorana neutrinos
with one zero, i.e.,

where a is complex and b, c are real parameters. As for Ml, because of its special structure,
resorting to a diagonal phase matrix, it can be transformed to a real symmetric matrix with three
parameters determined by masses of charged leptons. So it can be diagonalized by a matrix with

a simple analytical expression. As for Mν, it is magic, which predicts a trimaximal mixing pattern
(TM2) [20] if the mass matrix of charged leptons is diagonal. The structure of Mν is characterised
by the ratio b/c. So it can be diagonalized by a matrix with one real parameter. Furthermore, if
a is a real parameter, Mν would be more economical. However, in this case, ranges of mixing
parameters would be smaller. So we introduce a as a complex parameter in this paper.

In following sections, the analytical expression of the lepton mixing matrix is given. Numerical
predictions of the mixing parameters are obtained by scanning parameter space of mass matrices.
Stabilities of these predictions are examined by introduction of random perturbations that break
texture zeros of lepton mass matrices. Finally, a summary is presented.

II. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

In this section, we consider the analytical expression of mixing matrix and dependence of

observables on parameters in lepton mass matrices.

l )i2(Oν)2 je−i(φ j/2+β) + (O+

l )i3(Oν)3 je−iφ j/2.

(15)

Obviously, φ js are just relevant to Majorana phases of the mixing matrix.

B. Dependence of observables on parameters in lepton mass matrices

The mixing angles of leptons can be obtained from comparison of expression of Ui j in Eq. 15

with the form of U in the standard parametrization in Eq. 3 and Eq. 4. In detail, for θ13,

sin θ13 = |U13| = |(O+

l )11(Oν)13e−iα + (O+

l )12(Oν)23e−iβ + (O+

l )13(Oν)33|.

(16)

Because Ol is dependent on masses of charged leptons that are determined by experiments very
well, θ13 in fact is dependent on three real eﬀective mass parameter: α, β, and xν. The same
observation can also hold for θ23, θ13 and δ. Therefore, three mixing angles and Dirac CP violating
phase are not independent to each.

As for masses of neutrinos, i.e.,

√

m1 = |a −

b2 − bc + c2|, m2 = |a + b + c|, m3 = |a +

√
b2 − bc + c2|,

(17)

they are dependent on four real parameters of Mν. And the eﬀective mass of neutrinoless double-
beta decay, i.e.,

mee = m1U2
11

+ m2U2
12

+ m3U2
13,

(18)

is dependent on all 6 real parameters in Ml and Mν.

III. PREDICTIONS OF LEPTON MASS MATRICES AND THEIR STABILITIES

A. Predictions of lepton mass matrices

We take masses of charged leptons from Particle Data Group [24]:

me = 0.51 MeV, mµ = 105.658 MeV, mτ = 1776.86 MeV.

(19)

Then using the Mixing-Parameters-Tools package [25, 26] , we scan 6 real parameters in lepton
mass matrices, i.e., arg[Al], arg[Bl], arg[a], |a|, b, c. The numerical results are shown in Fig. 1,
including predictions for mixing angles (θ13, θ12, θ23), Dirac CP violating phase δ, mass ratios

(m1/m2, m2/m3), the mass of the lightest neutrino m1, sum of masses of neutrinos(cid:80) mi, the eﬀec-

tive mass of neutrinoless double-beta decay mee. Some comments are given as follows:
• Diﬀerent from the case where both of mass matrices of charged leptons and neutrinos are of
the form of Fritzsch texture [27], the octant of θ23 is uncertain in our case.
• Because of the strong mass hierarchy of charged leptons, the range of the Dirac CP violating
phase δ is narrow, i.e. , 0◦ ± 50◦ or 180◦ ± 50◦.
• The the upper limit of the mass of the lightest neutrino is small, i.e., about 23.5 meV. So is that
of the eﬀective mass of double-beta decay i.e., about 24 meV. Accordingly, the rate of neutrinoless
double-beta decay may be too small to detect in the present stage [29].
•
The mass ordering of neutrinos is normal. And the hierarchy of them is not strong. so the
upper limit of the sum of masses of neutrinos is also small, i.e. approximating 102 meV, which

satisﬁes new stringent constrains from cosmological observations, e.g.,(cid:80) mi < 146 meV at the 2σ

level in Ref. [30].

noless double-beta decay mee. Here the unit of angles is degree.

B. Stabilities of predictions under perturbations breaking zeros

The above predictions are obtained on the basis of the special combinations of texture zeros of
leptons mass matrices. In order to examine stabilities of these predictions, we introduce pertur-
bations that break zeros in the mass matrices. For charged leptons, the perturbation is proposed

IV. SUMMARY

There are many viable combinations of texture zeros in lepton mass matrices. According to
the criteria that the structure of leptons mass matrices should be economical and the prediction
of them should be robust, a special combination of texture zeros of mass matrices is proposed.
The analytical expression of lepton mixing matrix is obtained, which shows clear dependence of a
observable on model parameters. By scanning of parameter-space of mass matrices of leptons, nu-
merical predictions for mixing angles, Dirac CP violating phase, and masses and eﬀective masses
of neutrinos are given. These results satisfy constraints from neutrinos oscillation experiments and
those from new cosmological observations. These results are also stable under perturbations that

break zeros in mass matrices. So, in the complex forest of neutrinos mixing models, a simple and
robust one is still possible.
