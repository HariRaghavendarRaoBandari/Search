SUPERHARMONICITY OF LOGARITHM OF JACOBIAN OF

HARMONIC MAPPINGS BETWEEN SURFACES

DAVID KALAJ

ABSTRACT. We prove that the logarithm of the Jacobian of a sense preserving
harmonic mapping between surfaces is superharmonic, provided that the Gauss-
ian curvature of the image domain is non-negative.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. Harmonic mappings between Riemann surfaces. Let (N , σ) and (M, ρ)
be Riemann surfaces with smooth conformal metrics σ and ρ, respectively. If a
mapping f : (N , σ) → (M, ρ) is C 2, then f is said to be harmonic (or ρ-harmonic)
if
(1.1)
where z and w are the local parameters on M and N respectively (see [5]). Also
f satisﬁes (1.1) if and only if f is C 1 and its Hopf differential
(1.2)
is a holomorphic quadratic differential on N. It follows from (1.2), that (i) every
holomorphic mapping is harmonic and (ii) the composition of a harmonic mapping
and a holomorphic mapping is harmonic.

fzz + (log ρ2)w ◦ f · fz f¯z = 0,

Ψ = ρ2 ◦ f · fzf¯z

From now on, we will assume that M is parameterized by a complex domain Ω.
Let Ω be a domain in C and ρ be a conformal metric in Ω. The Gaussian curvature
of a double diferentiable metric ρ is given by

Kρ = −

2∆ log ρ

.

Let h be a solution of (1.1).
Let

mapping then

and

∆σ log |∂σh|2 = K1 − K2J σ
h

∆σ log | ¯∂σh|2 = K1 + K2J σ
h .

Here K1 is the Gaussian curvature of σ and K2 is the Gaussian curvature of ρ.

For our approach it will be useful to use the following direct corollary of Bochner’

formulas.

Corollary 1.2. If h is a harmonic mapping then

and

∆ log |∂h|2 = −K2Jh

∆ log | ¯∂h|2 = K2Jh.

Proposition 1.3. [10, p. 10-11] The functions |∂h| and | ¯∂u| are identically zero
or they have the isolated zeros with well deﬁned orders.

Let us conclude this introduction with the following observation concerning har-

monic maps.

For g : M 7→ N the energy integral is deﬁned by

(1.3)

Eρ[g] = ZM

(|∂σg|2 + | ¯∂σg|2)dVσ,

where ∂σg, and ¯∂σg are the partial derivatives taken with respect to the metrics ̺
and σ, and dVσ is the volume element on (M, σ). Assume that energy integral of
h is bounded. Then h is harmonic if and only if h is a critical point of the corre-
sponding functional where the homotopy class of h is the range of this functional.
For this deﬁnition and some important properties of harmonic maps see [10].

2. BACKGROUND AND STATEMENT OF THE MAIN RESULT

Manojlovi´c in [8] proved that a sense preserving Euclidean harmonic mapping
between two planar domains has superharmonic logarithm of Jacobian and used
this fact to prove the minimum principle for the Jacobian of Euclidean harmonic
mappings between planar domains. This fact has been used previously by the au-
thor in [6, p. 8], but here was not treated the superharmonicity of the logarithm of
Jacobian. This fact has been re-discovered by Iwaniec and Onninen in [2] and gen-
eralized by Iwaniec, Koski and Onninen in [3]. The aim of this note is to obtain a
similar results for the class of harmonic mappings between Riemann surfaces with
certain curvature conditions. We prove the following theorem

Theorem 2.1. If h is ρ-harmonic mapping between Riemann surfaces (D, σ) and
(Ω, ρ) such that the Gauss curvature of ρ is K2 and J = Jh = ρ2(h(z))(|hz |2 −
|h¯z|2) is the jacobian then

(2.1)

where

B = hz ¯z¯hz + h¯z¯hzz,

Dh = |∂h|2 + | ¯∂h|2.

In particular − log Ju is subharmonic, if h is a sense-preserving homeomorphism
and K2 ≥ 0.

Proof. In the sequel we make use of the formula

(2.2)

or what is the same

(2.3)

∆ log R =

R∆R − |∇R|2

R2

,

∆R =

|∇R|2

R

+ R∆ log R.

Here ∇R = (Rx, Ry) is the Euclidean gradient of a differentiable non-vanishing
real function R. Let J = Ju. Then by Bochner’s formula and the formula (2.2) for
|∂h|2 and | ¯∂h|2 we obtain

∆J = ∆|∂h|2 − ∆| ¯∂h|2

= |∂h|−2|∇|∂h|2|2 − | ¯∂h|−2|∇| ¯∂h|2|2 − K2JhDh,

where

Thus

Dh = |∂h|2 + | ¯∂h|2.

∆J = 4|∇|∂h||2 − 4|∇| ¯∂h||2 − K2JhDh.

Hence

J 2∆ log J = J∆J − |∇J|2

= J(4|∇|∂h||2 − 4|∇| ¯∂h||2 − K2JhDh) − |∇J|2.

On the sequel we use the formulas

|hz|2 = hz¯h¯z, and,

|h¯z|2 = h¯z ¯hz

and for a real function R the formula

|∇R| = 2|Rz|.

Since

we obtain that

which yields

J = |∂h|2 − |∂¯h|2 = ρ2(|hz|2 − |h¯z|2),

|∇J|2 = 4|Jz|2 = 4|(cid:0)ρ2(|hz|2 − |h¯z|2)(cid:1)z |2

and

|∇J|2 = 4|ρ2(cid:0)hzz¯h¯z + hz¯hz ¯z − hz ¯z¯hz − h¯z¯hzz(cid:1) + 2ρρz(|hz|2 − |h¯z|2)|2

After some easy manipulations we arrive at the equation

(2.4) |∇J|2 − J∆J = K2J 2Dh + 4ρ4 |hz|2

|h¯z|2 |B|2 + 4ρ4 |h¯z|2

|hz|2 |A|2 − 8ρ4ℜ(A ¯B)

where

and

A = hzz¯h¯z + ¯hz ¯zhz

B = hz ¯z¯hz + h¯z¯hzz.

From (2.4) and formula (2.2) we obtain (2.1) for the points on the domain where
∂h and ¯∂h does not vanish.

But Proposition 1.3 says that the isolated zeros of |∂h| and | ¯∂h| are isolated, and

thus (2.1) is valid except for a set of isolated points of D.

It remains to observe that

|h¯z|

+ 2(|A||B| − ℜ(A ¯B)) ≥ 0.

Since log Jh is continuous, we conclude that − log Ju is subharmonic under the
constraint K2 ≥ 0.
(cid:3)

Since a harmonic homeomorphism has the non-vanishing Jacobian (see e.g. [9]
or [1]), we know that log Ju is well deﬁned. By maximum principle for subhar-
monic functions we obtain

Corollary 2.2. Assume that h is a homeomorphism between surfaces (D, σ) and
(S, ρ) and let γ ⊂ D be a Jordan curve surrounding a domain Ω ⊂ D. Assume
further that the curvature of S is non-negative. Then

min{Ju(z) : z ∈ Ω ∪ γ} = min
z∈γ

Ju(z).

Corollary 2.3. Let h be as in Theorem 2.1 and let J 0
of h. Let r(x, y) = |h(x, y)| and assume that ρ is rotationally symmetric. Then

h be the Euclidean Jacobian

J 2 (cid:18) |hz|2

h = |hz|2 + |h¯z|2.

Proof. Since J = ρ2J 0, and

we obtain that

−∆ log J = −∆ log ρ2 − ∆ log J 0,

−∆ log J 0 = ∆ log ρ2 − ∆ log J 0.

So from (2.1) we obtain

For rotationally symmetric metric ρ(z) = ρ(r), where r = |z|, we have

K2 = −

∆ log ρ(r)2

ρ(r)2

= −

2(cid:0)ρ(r)ρ′′(r) − ρ′(r)2 + ρ(r)ρ′(r)/r(cid:1)

ρ(r)4

.

ρ(r)ρ′′(r) − ρ′(r)2 = −ρ(r)ρ′(r)/r + ρ(r)4K2/(−2)

Now if r(x, y) = |h(x, y)| we obtain

∆ log ρ(r)2 =

2(cid:0)(ρρ′′ − (ρ′)2)|∇r|2 + ρρ′∆r(cid:1)

ρ2

Thus

Hence

∆ log ρ(r)2 = (cid:16)(− 2ρρ′
