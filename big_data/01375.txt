Abstract. This article is concerned with the existence of nonnegative weak
solutions to a particular fourth-order partial diﬀerential equation: it is a formal
gradient ﬂow with respect to a generalized Wasserstein transportation distance
with nonlinear mobility. The corresponding free energy functional is referred
to as generalized Fisher information functional since it is obtained by au-
todissipation of another energy functional which generates the heat ﬂow as its
gradient ﬂow with respect to the aforementioned distance. Our main results
are twofold: For mobility functions satisfying a certain regularity condition,
we show the existence of weak solutions by construction with the well-known
minimizing movement scheme for gradient ﬂows. Furthermore, we extend these
results to a more general class of mobility functions: a weak solution can be
obtained by approximation with weak solutions of the problem with regularized
mobility.

This work is concerned with the existence of nonnegative weak solutions u :

where the admissible set C is a suitable subclass of curves (us, ws)s∈[0,1] satisfying
the continuity equation ∂sus = −div ws on [0, 1] × Ω and the initial and terminal
conditions us|s=0 = u0, us|s=1 = u1. We refer to [5, 9] (see also [4, 17]) for more
details concerning the deﬁnition and properties of Wm.
Before stating our assumptions on the mobility function m, let us consider the
linear case m = id. Then, it is well-known [2] that Wm coincides (up to a scal-
ing factor depending on the value of U ) with the classical L2-Wasserstein distance
W2 for probability measures on Ω. Using techniques from optimal transportation
theory (see, for instance, [16]), various equations of the form (1) for m = id have
been interpreted as gradient systems with respect to W2. The speciﬁc gradient ﬂow
structure often allows for the analysis of the well-posedness of the underlying evolu-
tion equation as well as for the study of the qualitative behaviour of the associated
gradient ﬂow solutions [7, 14]. A powerful tool for those investigations is provided
(6) below), a metric version
by the so-called minimizing movement scheme (cf.
of the implicit Euler scheme, which is used for the construction of a time-discrete
approximative gradient ﬂow. Even in very general situations, this approach can
be of use (see, for example, [1] for an abstract description or [3, 17] in the context
of coupled systems). A certain class of equations of the form (1) already has suc-
cessfully been proved to be well-posed by Lisini, Matthes and Savar´e [10] using its
variational structure in spaces w.r.t. the distance Wm. This work aims at a further
extension.

In their seminal paper [7] on the variational formulation of the Fokker-Planck

equation, Jordan, Kinderlehrer and Otto rigorously interpreted the heat equation

∂tu = ∆u

as W2-gradient ﬂow of Boltzmann’s entropy

H(u) =ZΩ

u log u dx.

Boltzmann’s entropy H shares an important property [13]: it is 0-convex along (gen-
eralized) geodesics with respect to the Wasserstein distance W2 and thus generates
a 0-contractive gradient ﬂow (in the sense of Ambrosio, Gigli and Savar´e [1]) along
which H descreases most. The corresponding dissipation of H over time is given by
the so-called Fisher information functional

F (u) =ZΩ
4|∇√u|2 dx.
∂tu = div(cid:18)u∇(cid:18) ∆√u
√u (cid:19)(cid:19)

Formally, F induces the (fourth-order) Derrida-Lebowitz-Speer-Spohn equation

as W2-gradient ﬂow. A thorough analysis of the relationship between H, F and
their corresponding evolution equations has been done by Gianazza, Savar´e and
Toscani [6], later generalized by Matthes, McCann and Savar´e [12] to more general
energy functionals in the Wasserstein framework. Even if the Fisher information

GENERALIZED FISHER INFORMATION

functional F does not admit a convexity condition along geodesics w.r.t. W2,
results on existence and convergence to equilibrium can be deduced using the fact
that F = |∂H|2, i.e., being the squared Wasserstein slope of Boltzmann’s entropy
H. The main aim of this work is to extend this speciﬁc connection to nonlinear
mobility functions m and the generalized Wasserstein distance Wm.
However, in this case, the structure of the slope w.r.t. Wm is not known explic-
itly. Moreover, convexity along geodesics in this space is a very rare property (cf.
[4, 17]), with the following exception: It is known that the heat entropy functional

H(u) =ZΩ

h(u(x)) dx, with h′′(z)m(z) = 1 for all z,

is 0-convex along geodesics w.r.t. Wm and generates the heat ﬂow as its
0-contractive gradient ﬂow. Formally, the dissipation of H along its own gradi-
ent ﬂow, i.e., its autodissipation, reads as

formation functional associated to the mobility m. For linear mobility, functionals
of the form (5) for other choices of f have already been studied in [11].

We impose the additional constraint u(t, x) ≤ S, where S > 0 either is a ﬁxed
real number or equal to +∞. The speciﬁc value of S is determined by the structure
of the mobility function m which is assumed to satisfy the following.

m ∈ C2((0, S)); m(z) > 0 and m′′(z) ≤ 0 for all z ∈ (0, S);
m(0) = 0, and, if S < ∞, m(S) = 0.

(M)

For mobilities satisfying (M), one can deﬁne the distance Wm via formula (4) on
the space

X :=(cid:26)u ∈ L1(Ω) : 0 ≤ u ≤ S a.e. in Ω,ZΩ

u dx = U(cid:27) ,

where U > 0 is a ﬁxed given number, see [5, 9]. In this work, we use some of the
topological properties of the metric space (X, Wm). The respective statements are
omitted here for the sake of brevity.

sup

z∈(0,S)

(−m′′(z)m(z)) < ∞.

(M-LSC)

In particular, mobilities satisfying (M-LSC) are Lipschitz continuous. In order to
also cover the framework of non-LSC mobilities, we will later require the following
on the strength of the singularities of m′ at the boundary of (0, S), if m does not
fulﬁll (M-LSC):

m′(z)2f (z) = 0,

In particular, (M-S) is met by the paradigmatic examples m(z) = zβ for β ∈ ( 2

Our proof of existence of solutions to (1) with F deﬁned as in (5) and mobilities
satisfying (M) and (M-LSC) relies on the formal gradient structure of equation (1).
We use the time-discrete minimizing movement scheme for the construction of weak
solutions in the space X: given a step size τ > 0, deﬁne a sequence (un
τ )n≥0 in X
recursively via

With the sequence (un

τ )n≥0 from (6), we deﬁne a time-discrete function

uτ : [0,∞) × Ω → [0,∞] via piecewise constant interpolation:
if t ∈ ((n − 1)τ, nτ ] for some n ≥ 1;

uτ (t) := un
τ

uτ (0) := u0.

(7)

The resulting main theorem on the limit behaviour of (uτ )τ >0 in the continuous

time limit τ ց 0 is as follows.
Theorem 1.1 (Existence for Lipschitz mobilities). Assume that (M) and (M-LSC)
hold, and if S = ∞, let (M-PG) be satisﬁed. Let an initial condition u0 ∈ X with
F (u0) < ∞ be given.
Then, for each step size τ > 0, a time-discrete function uτ : [0,∞) → X can
be constructed via the minimizing movement scheme (6)& (7). Moreover, for each
vanishing sequence τk → 0 of step sizes, there exists a (non-relabelled) subsequence
and a limit function u : [0,∞) → X such that the following is true for arbitrary
T > 0:
(a) u ∈ C1/2([0, T ]; (X, Wm)) ∩ L∞([0, T ]; Lp(Ω)) for some p > 1; and

f (u) ∈ L∞([0, T ]; H 1(Ω)) ∩ L2([0, T ]; H 2(Ω)).

(b) uτk converges to u as k → ∞ strongly in Lp([0, T ]; Lp(Ω)) and pointwise with
respect to t ∈ [0, T ] in (X, Wm). f (uτk) converges to f (u) as k → ∞ strongly
in L2([0, T ]; H 1(Ω)) and weakly in L2([0, T ]; H 2(Ω)).

map t 7→ F (u(t)) is almost everywhere equal to a nonincreasing function.

Notice that due to the non-convexity of the problem, we do not obtain unique-
ness of solutions. The study of qualitative properties of u with respect to (large)
time is postponed to future research.

Our second main theorem extends the result to mobilities m which are not Lip-
schitz continuous. We obtain a weak solution to (1) no longer by approximation
via the minimizing movement scheme (6), but as a limit of solutions of (1) for mo-
bilities mδ which are close to m and satisfy (M-LSC), as δ → 0. Speciﬁcally, we
approximate m by mδ as in [10]:

Let δ ∈ (0, δ) and δ > 0 suﬃciently small.
If S < ∞, deﬁne

mδ(z) := m(cid:18) zδ,1 − zδ,2

S

z − zδ,1(cid:19) − δ,

where zδ,1 < zδ,2 are the two solutions of m(z) = δ.
If S = ∞, deﬁne

mδ(z) := m(z + zδ) − δ,

where zδ is the unique solution of m(z) = δ.

(8)

(9)

Since mδ is constructed in such a way that (M-LSC) is fulﬁlled, there exists a
weak solution uδ to (1) with initial condition u0 (which is assumed to be independent
of δ and such that Fδ(u0) < ∞), in the sense of Theorem 1.1, for each δ. To indicate
the dependence of F on m, we e.g. write fδ and Fδ when mδ is considered in place
of m. Analysing the limit behaviour of the family (uδ)δ>0 as δ ց 0, we ﬁnd that
the properties of uδ carry over to the limit:

Theorem 1.2 (Existence for non-Lipschitz mobilities). Assume that m satisﬁes
(M), (M-S), and if S = ∞, also (M-PG), and deﬁne mδ for δ ∈ (0, δ) and suﬃ-
ciently small δ as in (8)/ (9). Let an initial condition u0 ∈ X with Fδ(u0) < ∞
be given and denote by uδ a weak solution to (1) with mδ in place of m and initial
condition u0 in the sense of Theorem 1.1, for each δ ∈ (0, δ). Then, there exists a
vanishing sequence δk → 0 and a map u : [0,∞) → X such that for the sequence
(uδk )k∈N and the limit u, one has
(a) u ∈ C1/2([0, T ]; (X, Wm)) ∩ L∞([0, T ]; Lp(Ω)) for some p > 1; and
f (u) ∈ L∞([0, T ]; H 1(Ω)) ∩ L2([0, T ]; H 2(Ω)).
(b) uδk converges to u as k → ∞ strongly in Lp([0, T ]; Lp(Ω)) and pointwise with
respect to t ∈ [0, T ] in (X, Wm). fδk (uδk ) converges to f (u) as k → ∞ strongly
in L2([0, T ]; H 1(Ω)) and weakly in L2([0, T ]; H 2(Ω)).

The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 is concerned with the proof of The-
orem 1.1. We ﬁrst study the discrete curves obtained by the minimizing movement
scheme in Section 2.1 before passing to the continuous time limit in Section 2.2. In
Section 3, we show Theorem 1.2. Properties of the approximation with Lipschitz
mobilities are investigated in Section 3.1, its convergence in Section 3.2

2. Lipschitz mobility functions

In this section, we prove Theorem 1.1. In advance of studying the properties of
the scheme (6)&(7), we ﬁrst prove an auxiliary result on the relationship between
F and H. To this end, we make the following speciﬁc choice of the integrand h of
H (compare with [10]):

For some ﬁxed s0 ∈ (0, S), set h(z) :=Z z

for z ∈ (0, S).
Note that the following statement does not require condition (M-LSC).
Lemma 2.1 (Estimate on H). Assume that m satisﬁes (M), and, if S = ∞,
also (M-PG). Then, there exist C > 0 and q ≥ 1 such that for all u ∈ X with
f (u) ∈ H 1(Ω), one has

behaviour of h as z ց 0: for z < s0, one has

So, if S < ∞, h is a bounded function. Hence, as f is increasing, we have

To prove the additional regularity property (17), we apply the ﬂow interchange
technique from [12], using the heat entropy H as 0-convex auxiliary functional. The
relevant symbolic calculations are already contained in the proof of [11, Prop. 7.3]
where a functional of similar form has been studied: here, it is suﬃcient to show
that

f ′′(z)2 ≥ 3

and the claim follows by assumption (M) on the mobility m.

The ﬁrst estimate in (c) is an immediate consequence of the energy estimate (15)

Using the ﬁrst estimate and the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality, the above

With the techniques from [10, 11], one deduces an approximate weak formulation
of equation (1) satisﬁed by the discrete curve uτ . The cornerstone of the derivation
again is the ﬂow interchange lemma [12, Thm. 3.2]. This time, the auxiliary
functional is the regularized potential energy

where β > 0 and φ ∈ C∞(Ω) with ∂ν φ = 0 on ∂Ω are given: it is known [10, 17]
under the assumptions (M) and (M-LSC) on m that V induces a κβ-contractive
gradient ﬂow on (X, Wm), for κβ = − C
β with a ﬁxed constant C > 0. For the sake
of brevity, we skip the calculations here and directly state the result:

2.2. Passage to the continuous time limit. The remainder of this section is
concerned with the passage to the continuous time limit τ ց 0.
In particular,
we show that the passage to the limit inside (18) yields the time-continuous weak
formulation of (1), completing the proof of Theorem 1.1. In order to obtain conver-
gence in a strong sense, we make use of the following extension of the Aubin-Lions
compactness lemma.

Theorem 2.3 (Extension of the Aubin-Lions lemma [15, Thm. 2]). Let Y be a Ba-
nach space and A : Y → [0,∞] be lower semicontinuous and have relatively compact
sublevels in Y. Let furthermore W : Y × Y → [0,∞] be lower semicontinuous and

such that W(u,eu) = 0 for u,eu ∈ Dom(A) implies u =eu.

Let (Uk)k∈N be a sequence of measurable functions Uk : (0, T ) → Y. If

then there exists a subsequence that converges in measure w.r.t. t ∈ (0, T ) to a limit
U : (0, T ) → Y.
Proof of Theorem 1.1: Let a vanishing sequence (τk)k∈N of step sizes be given and
deﬁne the corresponding sequence of discrete solutions (uτk ) via (6)&(7). Thanks to
the a priori
there exists a map
u ∈ C1/2([0, T ]; (X, Wm)) ∩ L∞([0, T ]; Lp(Ω)) such that uτk converges (on a non-
relabelled subsequence) to u both weakly in Lp([0, T ]; Lp(Ω)) (as a consequence of
the Banach-Alaoglu theorem) as well as in (X, Wm) pointwise w.r.t. t ∈ [0, T ] (as a
consequence of the topological properties of the distance Wm and a reﬁned version
of the Arzel`a-Ascoli theorem [1, Prop. 3.3.1]).

from Proposition 1(a)–(c),

estimates

Furthermore, Proposition 1(c) and the Banach-Alaoglu theorem yield the exis-
tence of v ∈ L2([0, T ]; H 2(Ω)) such that f (uτk) converges weakly to v in
L2([0, T ]; H 2(Ω)), possibly extracting another subsequence. We now prove that
f (uτk) → f (u) strongly in L2([0, T ]; L2(Ω)) for u = f −1◦v. By a standard interpola-
tion inequality, the desired strong convergence of f (uτk) → f (u) in L2([0, T ]; H 1(Ω))
then follows. Strong convergence of uτk to u in Lp([0, T ]; Lp(Ω)) (on a subsequence)
is achieved by essentially the same technique as in [17, 11] applying Theorem 2.3
for the admissible choices Y := Lp(Ω) (with p > 1 from Proposition 1(c)),

and

otherwise.

We refer to [11] for the details. A rather straightforward application of Vitali’s
convergence theorem subsequently yields the strong convergence of f (uτk ) → f (u)
in L2([0, T ]; L2(Ω)).
Obviously, this convergence property shows in combination with (15) the claimed
convergence and monotonicity of the energy F in Theorem 1.1(c). To prove that
the limit u indeed is a weak solution to (1), we verify that for all φ ∈ C∞(Ω) with
∂ν φ = 0 on ∂Ω and all η ∈ C∞
c ((0,∞)) ∩ C([0,∞)), the following continuous weak
formulation holds:

0 =Z ∞
0 ZΩ

(−∂tηφu + ηf ′(u)∆f (u) [∇m(u) · ∇φ + m(u)∆φ]) dx dt.
We set βk := √τk in the discrete weak formulation (18). Then, as (H(un

Since ητk → η uniformly and ∆f (uτk ) ⇀ ∆f (u) weakly in L2([0, T ]; L2(Ω)), it
suﬃces to prove that ∇pm(uτk ) → ∇pm(u) strongly in L2([0, T ]; L2(Ω)), in view
of Poincar´e’s inequality. Using the deﬁnition of f and writing g := f −1 (which exists
by strict monotonicity, recall that m(z) > 0 for z ∈ (0, S)), this is equivalent to

proving that ∇g′(vτk ) converges to ∇g′(v) strongly in L2([0, T ]; L2(Ω)) for v := f (u)
and vτk := f (uτk ), since one has

Since m satisﬁes (M) and (M-LSC), m′ ◦ g is continuous and bounded. Due to the
strong convergence of vτk to v in L2([0, T ]; H 1(Ω)) and Vitali’s theorem, (∇vτk )k∈N
is uniformly integrable in L2([0, T ]× Ω). Without restruction, we may assume that
vτk to v almost everywhere on [0, T ] × Ω. Hence, another application of Vitali’s
theorem yields the asserted strong convergence of 1

3. Non-Lipschitz mobility functions

In this section, we consider mobility functions which do not satisfy (M-LSC),
but can be approximated in a suitable way by LSC mobilities, see (8)&(9). Our
strategy of proof for Theorem 1.2 is as follows: ﬁrst, we demonstrate that the a priori
estimates from Proposition 1 are uniform w.r.t. the approximation parameter δ > 0
when considering a family (uδ)δ∈(0,δ) of weak solutions to (1) with initial condition
u0 (independent of δ) for mδ in place of m (in the sense of Theorem 1.1). This will
allow us to pass to the limit δ ց 0 in the weak formulation (19) of (1) for mδ to
obtain the sought-for weak formulation of (1) for m.

3.1. A priori estimates. This section is devoted to the derivation of the necessary
a priori estimates on the family (uδ)δ∈(0,δ) introduced above. For deﬁniteness,
notice that at each ﬁxed u ∈ X and for all 0 < δ0 ≤ δ1 ≤ δ, one has

since m(z) ≥ mδ0(z) ≥ mδ1 (z) for all z ∈ (0, S) (see [10]). Hence,

Fδ(u0) ≤ Fδ(u0),

so the condition Fδ(u0) < ∞ and Theorem 1.1 provide the existence of (uδ)δ∈(0,δ).
Lemma 3.1 (A priori estimates). Let a suﬃciently small δ > 0 be given and let
(uδ)δ∈(0,δ) be a family of weak solutions to (1) for mδ in place of m with initial
condition u0 (in the sense of Theorem 1.1). Then, for all δ ∈ (0, δ) and all T > 0:
(a) Fδ(uδ(t)) ≤ Fδ(u0) for all t ∈ [0, T ],

(b) Wm(uδ(s), uδ(t)) ≤p2Fδ(u0)|s − t| for all s, t ∈ [0, T ],

(c) kfδ(uδ)kL∞([0,T ];H 1) ≤ C,
(d) kfδ(uδ)kL2([0,T ];H 2) ≤ C,
(e) kuδkL∞([0,T ];Lp) ≤ C,
for some p > 1 and C > 0 independent of δ.

Proof. For part (a), we obtain by Theorem 1.1(c):

Fδ(uδ(t)) ≤ Fδ(u0) ≤ Fδ(u0) < ∞ for all t ∈ [0, T ].

Consequently, (b) immediately follows from the H¨older estimate for uδ in (X, Wmδ )

(recall (16) and Theorem 1.1(b)) and the monotonicity Wm(u,eu) ≤ Wmδ (u,eu)
for each u,eu ∈ X. The claims (c)–(e) are a consequence of (a) and the respective

estimates of Proposition 1(c) the proof of which does not rely on condition (M-LSC).
(cid:3)

3.2. Convergence. In this section, we prove Theorem 1.2. As a preparation, we
show

Lemma 3.2 (Local uniform convergence). Let a vanishing sequence (δk)k∈N in
(0, δ) be given and denote, for each k, gδk := f −1
. The following statements hold:
δk
(a) If S = ∞, there exists a (non-relabelled) subsequence on which the sequence

(Gδk )k∈N, deﬁned by

Gδk : [0,∞) → R, Gδk (w) := m′

δk (gδk (w))√w,

converges locally uniformly to the continuous map

G : [0,∞) → R, G(w) := m′(g(w))√w for w > 0, G(0) := 0.

(b) If S < ∞, there exists a (non-relabelled) subsequence on which the sequence

converges uniformly to the continuous map

eGδk : [0, f (S)] → R,

(eGδk )k∈N, deﬁned by
eG : [0, f (S)] → R,

eGδk (w) := m′

δk (gδk (w))pw(fδk (S) − w),
eG(w) := m′(g(w))pw(f (S) − w) for w ∈ (0, f (S)),
eG(0) := 0,

eG(f (S)) := 0.

Proof. At ﬁrst, we prove—for arbitrary S—that (gδk )k∈N converges (on a suitable
subsequence) locally uniformly on [0, S) to g := f −1. Indeed, using the monotonicity
mδk ≤ m on [0, S) and (20), we obtain the diﬀerential estimate

δk (w) =r 1

2

mδk (gδk (w)) ≤r 1

2

0 ≤ g′

m(gδk (w)) ≤ C(gδk (w) + 1),

where the constant C > 0 does not depend on k. Using Gronwall’s lemma, we
deduce that gδk , and consequently also g′
, is k-uniformly bounded on compact
δk
subsets of [0, S). The application of the Arzel`a-Ascoli theorem yields the desired
local uniform convergence.

Consider the case S = ∞. Using the monotonicity properties (see [10] again)

in combination with the concavity of m, we ﬁnd that for all w > 0:

δk (z) ≤ m′(z) and g(w) ≥ gδk (w)
m′
δk (g(w))√w ≤ Gδk (w) ≤ m′(gδk (w))√w.

Clearly, Gδk (w) → G(w) if w > 0. Moreover, this property also extends to w = 0 by
existence of the limit as w ց 0, cf. condition (M-S), and G is continuous. Observe
(g(w))√w)k∈N and (m′(gδk (w))√w)k∈N are monotonic in k at each ﬁxed
that (m′
δk
w > 0. Invoking Dini’s theorem and a diagonal argument, we deduce the claimed
local uniform convergence of Gδk to G, extracting a certain subsequence.

Consider now the case S < ∞. Fix 0 < ez0 < ez1 < S such that m′(ez0) > 0
and m′(ez1) < 0, and deﬁne ew0 = f (ez0), ew1 = f (ez1). We distinguish the cases
w ∈ [0,ew0], w ∈ [ew0,ew1] and w ∈ [ew1, f (S)]. Clearly, by smoothness of m and
mδk , the claim is true for w ∈ [ew0,ew1]. For the case w ∈ [0,ew0], we argue similarly

as above; recall that fδk (S) ↓ f (S) and observe that (22) also holds in the case at
hand:

m′

δk (g(w))pw(f (S) − w) ≤ eGδk (w) ≤ m′(gδk (w))pw(fδk (S) − w).

δk

(g(w))pw(f (S) − w))k∈N and
Again, eGδk (w) → eG(w) if w ≥ 0, and (m′
(m′(gδk (w))pw(fδk (S) − w))k∈N are monotonic, so proceed as above. For the re-
maining case w ∈ [ew1, f (S)], we have:
|eGδk (w)| ≤ |m′(gδk (w))|pw(fδk (S) − w) ≤ |eG(w)|s fδk (S) − w
f (S) − w ≤ 2|eG(w)|,
ε > 0 a ew ≥ ew1 such that |eGδk (w) − eG(w)| ≤ 2|eG(w)| < ε for all w ∈ [ew, f (S)]
convergence of eGδk (w) to eG(w) on [ew1,ew] yields the claim.

and suﬃciently large k ∈ N. Combining this with the—again obvious—uniform

provided that k is suﬃciently large. Consequently, by (M-S), there exists for each

Now, we are in position to complete the proof of Theorem 1.2.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.2: In complete analogy to the proof of Theorem 1.1 from Sec-
tion 2.2, one deduces the existence of a limit map u : [0,∞) → X such that,
on a suitable subsequence of the vanishing sequence (δk)k∈N in (0, δ), the claims
(a)–(c) in Theorem 1.2 are true. It remains to show that the limit u satisﬁes the
weak formulation (19), given that uδk satisﬁes (19) for mδk and fδk in place of
m and f , respectively. As before, the proof is complete if, extracting a further

subsequence, ∇pmδk (uδk ) → ∇pm(u) strongly in L2([0, T ]; L2(Ω)). Again, in-
troducing the inverse functions gδk := f −1
and g := f −1, we have to verify that
δk
m′(gδk (vδk ))∇vδk → m′(g(v))∇v strongly in L2([0, T ]; L2(Ω)), for v := f (u) and
vδk := fδk (uδk ) (recall (20)&(21)).

We ﬁrst consider the case S = ∞ and observe that

m′(gδk (vδk ))∇vδk = 2Gδk (vδk )∇√vδk

a.e. on [0, T ] × Ω.

By Lemma 3.2 and since, without restriction, ∇vδk → ∇v pointwise almost every-
where on [0, T ] × Ω, we obtain that

2Gδk (vδk )∇√vδk → 2G(v)∇√v = m′(g(v))∇v

pointwise almost everywhere on [0, T ]×Ω. Furthermore, using (M-S) and (M) yields
Gδk (vδk ) ≤ C(√w + 1) for some k-independent constant C > 0. Hence, for each

14

measurable set A ⊂ [0, T ] × Ω, one has for suﬃciently large k that

where we used the well-known Lions-Villani estimate on square roots [8] (see [10,
Lemma A.1] for a formulation in the framework at hand) in the last step. Since
(vδk )k∈N is L2-uniformly integrable (by Vitali’s theorem), the former estimate also
yields L2-uniform integrability of (2Gδk (vδk )∇√vδk )k∈N as vδk is k-uniformly
bounded in L2([0, T ]; H 2(Ω)). Applying Vitali’s theorem once again gives
m′(gδk (vδk ))∇vδk → m′(g(v))∇v strongly in L2([0, T ]; L2(Ω)), extracting a sub-
sequence if necessary.

Consider the remaining case S < ∞ and notice that

m′(gδk (vδk ))∇vδk =

2

fδk (S)eGδk (vδk )h∇√vδk + ∇pfδk (S) − vδki

almost everywhere on [0, T ] × Ω. Thanks to Lemma 3.2, one has

for some eC′ > 0 which does not depend on k. Applying Vitali’s theorem as in the
former case yields the asserted strong convergence m′(gδk (vδk ))∇vδk → m′(g(v))∇v
in L2([0, T ]; L2(Ω)).
All in all, we have proved that u = f (v) satisﬁes the weak formulation (19) of
(cid:3)

(1), so the proof of Theorem 1.2 is ﬁnished.
