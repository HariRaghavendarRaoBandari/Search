Generalizations of polylogarithms for Feynman integrals

Abstract

In this talk, we discuss recent progress in the application of generalizations of polylog-
arithms in the symbolic computation of multi-loop integrals. We brieﬂy review the Maple
program MPL which supports a certain approach for the computation of Feynman integrals
in terms of multiple polylogarithms. Furthermore we discuss elliptic generalizations of poly-
logarithms which have shown to be useful in the computation of the massive two-loop sunrise
integral.

1 Motivation: Multiple polylogarithms and Feynman integrals

Classical polylogarithms Lin are obtained as a generalization of the logarithm function

Li1(z) = − ln(1 − z) =

, |z| < 1,

zj
j

by allowing for higher integer powers of the summation variable in the denominator:

These functions can be expressed in terms of integrals. For the dilogarithm, Leibniz [54] already
found the identity

Lin(z) =

jn , |z| < 1.

Li2(z) = −

ln(1 − x).

If we write all integrations on the right-hand side of this equation explicitly, we obtain an iterated
integral

suﬃces to construct the classical polylogarithms.

Generalizations of polylogarithms can be obtained by either generalizing the terms in the
sum representation or by extending the set of diﬀerential 1-forms. In both ways, one arrives at
multiple polylogarithms. They are deﬁned as the series [44, 45]

and they can be expressed in terms of iterated integrals known as hyperlogarithms [61, 52, 53].
These are obtained from diﬀerential 1-forms of the set

Some powerful methods and computer programs for the analytical computation of Feynman
integrals rely on either the sum representation or on an integral representation of multiple po-
lylogarithms. In section 2 we review the computer program MPL which supports an approach
based on iterated integrals. For Feynman integrals which can not be expressed in terms of mul-
tiple polylogarithms, we are in search of alternatives. In section 3 we brieﬂy recall the concept of
elliptic functions and in section 4 we discuss an elliptic generalization of polylogarithms which
arises from the computation of the massive sunrise integral.

Iterated integrals and the program MPL

As an alternative to hyperlogarithms, we consider a class of iterated integrals over diﬀerential
1-forms in the set

ΩMPL =

where

In order to obtain a framework of well-deﬁned functions of the k variables x1, ..., xk, we construct
only iterated integrals which are homotopy invariant. In general, an iterated integral admits this
property, if and only if it satisﬁes the condition [40]

where the operator D is deﬁned by

D [ω1|...|ωm] = 0

m(cid:88)
(cid:20) dx3

i=1

D [ω1|...|ωm] =

[ω1|...|ωi−1|dωi|ωi+1|...ωm] +

[ω1|...|ωi−1|ωi ∧ ωi+1|...|ωm].

For example, among the two integrals

(cid:21)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) d (x2x3)

x2x3 − 1

, I2 =

(cid:21)

x2x3 − 1

,

I1 =

(cid:20) dx3

only I1 is homotopy invariant while I2 fails eq. 6. For any number of variables k, we can apply
algorithms described in [22, 23] to construct a basis of all homotopy invariant iterated integrals
over 1-forms in ΩMPL. Together with certain boundary conditions at a tangential basepoint (see
[23]), this construction provides a Q-vectorspace V (ΩMPL) of functions, including the class of
multiple polylogarithms.

MPL [21] is a Maple program for computations with this class of functions. Its main algo-
rithms [23] rely on the mathematical theory developed in [31]. One of the main purposes of the
program is the computation of deﬁnite integrals of the type

where f ∈ V (ΩMPL) , q is some arbitrary polynomial in xn, all aj ∈ N and all pj are polynomials
of the type of eq. 5. For example, the program computes analytically

Such integrals appear in various contexts. Examples are given in [34, 21, 23].

The other main purpose of the program MPL is the analytical computation of a certain class
of scalar Feynman integrals. For some Feynman graph G, consider the D-dimensional, scalar

the sum of all νi, Λ is a set of kinematical invariants and masses and H = 1 −(cid:80)

where N is the number of edges of G, νi are integer powers of the Feynman propagators, ν is
i∈S xi for some
choice of S ⊆ {1, ..., N}. The terms U and F are the Symanzik polynomials in the Feynman
parameters x1, ..., xN (see e.g. [25]). Applying the methods of [58, 56, 35] we can expand such a
possibly divergent integral as a Laurent series in a parameter  of dimensional regularisation,

∞(cid:88)

j=−2L

I =

Ijj,

such that the integrals Ij are ﬁnite. The integrands of these Ij will involve Symanzik polynomials
of G and of related graphs.

In general, Symanzik polynomials are more complicated than the polynomials of eq. 5. The-
refore, the computation involves some additional steps. Before each integration, MPL attempts
to express the integrand in the form of eq. 8 by an appropriate change of variables. Then the
integral is computed and the result is mapped back to Feynman parameters, as a preparation of
the next integration. In order for all Feynman parameters to be integrated out in this way, the
(Symanzik) polynomials in the original integrand have to satisfy the condition of linear reducibi-
lity as discussed in [32, 33, 60]. This and two further conditions can be checked by the program.
If they are satisﬁed, the integral can be computed automatically with MPL. Examples are given
in [21] and in a manual obtained with the program.

A similar approach is followed by Panzer’s program HyperInt [59], based on hyperlogarithms,
which is publicly available as well, and related methods are applied by programs discussed in
[1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 30].

What if a given Feynman integral does not satisfy the criterion of linear reducibility? In some
cases, this problem is just an artefact of the parametrization and after some clever change of
variables, the above approach can still be applied1. However, there are as well Feynman integrals,
which can not be expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms, no matter which parameters
or classes of iterated integrals we try to apply. For such Feynman integrals, we have to turn to
other frameworks of functions. The given success with multiple polylogarithms suggests to give
further generalizations of polylogarithms a try.

3 Elliptic generalizations
Let us recall the basic concept of an elliptic function. In the complex plane of a variable x ∈ C
we consider the lattice L = Z + τZ, where τ ∈ C with Im(τ ) > 0 (the points in ﬁg. 1). A function
f (x) is called elliptic with respect to L if

f (x) = f (x + λ) for λ ∈ L.

(10)

It makes sense to consider such a function f only in one cell of the lattice (the grey area in ﬁg.
1), as its behaviour in all other cells are just copies. If τ is the quotient of two periods ψ1, ψ2 of
an elliptic curve E, this cell of the lattice is isomorphic to E and we can consider f as a function
on the elliptic curve.

Now we introduce a change of variables, considering the function f(cid:48)(z) of z ∈ C(cid:63) given by

f(cid:48)(cid:0)e2πix(cid:1) = f (x) .

Clearly, if f is elliptic with respect to L, then with respect to the new variable z, eq. 10 implies

(11)
Now there is a simple idea for the construction of such elliptic functions. If f(cid:48)(z) can be

f(cid:48) (z) = f(cid:48) (z · q) where q = e2πiλ for λ ∈ L.

deﬁned with the help of some other function g(z) as

(cid:88)

n∈Z

f(cid:48)(z) =

g (z · qn) ,

it satisﬁes eq. 11 by construction.

This concept can be applied to deﬁne elliptic generalizations of polylogarithms. A ﬁrst ver-
sion of an elliptic dilogarithm was deﬁned in [17] for the single-valued Bloch-Wigner dilogarithm.

1An example for such a case is the graph found to be irreducible in [24] and later computed in [48, 58].

Later the concept was generalized in various directions (see [66, 15, 55, 43]). Let us refer partic-
ularly to [36] where elliptic polylogarithms of the form

Em(z) =

unLim (z · qn)

(12)

(cid:88)

n∈Z

with a damping factor u are considered and where the concept is furthermore generalized to
establish multiple elliptic polylogarithms.

In the following section, a related class of functions appears in the context of a Feynman

integral.

(cid:17)

is a Feynman integral which can not be expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms. This
integral was extensively considered in the literature [11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 27, 39, 37, 38, 46, 47,
51, 62, 63, 65, 64, 26, 50, 41, 42]. In a recent computation of the case D = 2 and equal masses,
m1 = m2 = m3, for the ﬁrst time an elliptic polylogarithm was applied explicitly to express
a Feynman integral [20]. Here we discuss further cases of the sunrise integral where elliptic
generalizations of polylogarithms arise.

At ﬁrst, let us consider the integral with three diﬀerent particle masses as Laurent series at

two and around four dimensions:

S(2 − 2, t) = S(0)(2, t) + S(1)(2, t) + O(cid:0)2(cid:1) ,

S(4 − 2, t) = S(−2)(4, t)−2 + S(−1)(4, t)−1 + S(0)(4, t) + O().

(13)
(14)

Here we have used t = p2. We begin with the result for exactly D = 2 dimensions, S(0)(2, t).
In this case, the Feynman parametric representation (eq. 9) of the sunrise integral only involves
the second Symanzik polynomial

F = −x1x2x3t +(cid:0)x1m2

1 + x2m2

2 + x3m2

(cid:1) (x1x2 + x2x3 + x1x3)

whose zero-set intersects the integration domain at three points P1, P2, P3. Together with each
possible choice of one of these points as the origin, this zero-set deﬁnes an elliptic curve.

In [7] the following functions are introduced:

Notice that these deﬁnitions are related to the basic ideas recalled in section 3 but slightly diﬀer2
from the functions of eq. 12. By use of the diﬀerential equation of second order [57] for S(0)(2, t),
we obtain

Here ψ1 and ψ2 are periods of the elliptic curve deﬁned by F, which are given by complete elliptic
integrals of the ﬁrst kind [6]. The three arguments wi(q), i = 1, 2, 3, are directly related to the
three intersection points P1, P2, P3 (see [7]).

While all terms in eq. 17 can be nicely related to the underlying elliptic curve, the situation
becomes considerably more complicated for the higher coeﬃcients of eqs. 13 and 14. Here the
integrands under consideration depend on both Symanzik polynomials. However, the functions
deﬁned in eqs. 15 and 16 remain to be useful. Generalizing this concept, we furthermore introduce
the multi-variable functions [10]

(18)

By use of this set-up of functions, the coeﬃcients S(1)(2, t) and S(0)(4, t) are computed in [8].
Furthermore it is shown in [10], that in the case of equal masses, every higher coeﬃcient of the
two-dimensional case S(2−2, t) can be expressed in terms of these functions as well. This result
includes an explicit algorithm for the computation of these coeﬃcients.

We want to point out that other elliptic generalizations of polylogarithms recently found
further applications to the two- and the three-loop sunrise graph [18, 19] and to integrals arising
in string theory [49, 28, 29].

5 Conclusions

With their double nature as nested sums and iterated integrals, multiple polylogarithms provide
a very useful framework for the computation of Feynman integrals. The Maple program MPL
serves for the computation of a certain class of Feynman integrals in terms of these functions.
The program is publicly available and supports computations with a class of iterated integrals,
which arise in other contexts as well.

The massive two-loop sunrise integral is a Feynman integral which can not be expressed in
terms of multiple polylogarithms. For the computation of various cases of this integral, a class of
elliptic generalizations of polylogarithms has shown to be useful. These and other appearances
of elliptic generalizations give rise to the hope, that when we have to leave the realm of multiple
polylogarithms, we might not have to dispense with all of its advantages.
