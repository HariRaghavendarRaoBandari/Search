It was proved by Hoeﬀding in 1963 that a real random variable X conﬁned to [a, b]

satisﬁes E eX−E X ≤ e(b−a)2/8. We generalise this to complex random variables.

Abstract

Introduction

A celebrated concentration inequality of Hoeﬀding relies on the following bound.
Lemma 1.1 ([4]). Let X be a real random variable such that a ≤ X ≤ b. Then

1 ≤ E eX−E X ≤ e(b−a)2/8.

Given the hundreds of references to this inequality in the literature, we believe that
a similarly tight bound for complex random variables may also have application. Indeed,
our ongoing investigation of complex martingales related to multidimensional asymptotics
encounters such a need. Our aim, therefore, is to ﬁnd a complex analogue of Lemma 1.1.

There are several possible complex replacements for the real bounds a ≤ X ≤ b. A natural
choice would be to conﬁne Z to a disk of given radius, but we will use the weaker condition
that the support of Z has bounded diameter. This measure of spread naturally arises in
the study of separately Lipschitz functions [2], also called functions satisfying the bounded
diﬀerence condition [1]. For a complex random variable Z, deﬁne the diameter of Z to be

diam Z = inf(cid:8)c ∈ R | P (|Z1 − Z2| > c) = 0(cid:9),

(1.1)

where Z1, Z2 are independent copies of Z,

with the inﬁmum of an empty set taken to be ∞.

Since Hoeﬀding’s bound states that E eX−E X is concentrated near 1, the natural complex
analogue is to bound the distance of E eZ−E Z from 1. This is the nature of our main theorem.
Theorem 1.1. Let Z be a complex random variable with diam Z ≤ d. Then

|E eZ−E Z − 1| ≤ ed2/8 − 1.

Since |Z − E Z| ≤ α implies diam Z ≤ 2α, Theorem 1.1 has a simple consequence, which
is a complex version of an inequality used many times in proving Azuma-type inequalities.
Corollary 1.1. Let Z be a complex random variable with |Z − E Z| ≤ α a.s.. Then

|E eZ−E Z − 1| ≤ eα2/2 − 1.

Note that in both the theorem and its corollary, distrubutions supported on {−1, +1}

are enough to show that the constants (respectively 1

8 and 1

2) cannot be reduced.

Corollary 1.1 and weaker versions of Theorem 1.1 can be proved by simpler means. For
example, the referee noted that Corollary 1.1 (which implies Theorem 1.1 with constant 1
2
instead of 1
8) can be proved by representing complex numbers by real matrices and applying
result of Tropp [8, Lemmas 7.6–7].

Hoeﬀding actually found the best possible bound on eX−E X in the real case, as we recall
in the next section. In Section 2.1 we show that for d ≤ 3.12 the same tighter bound holds
in the complex case too, making use of a lemma that only random variables with support of
at most three points need to be considered. Then in Section 2.2 we complete the proof of
Theorem 1.1 for all d.

2 Results

Hoeﬀding’s paper [4] used the convexity of the exponential function to ﬁnd the tightest
possible bound in the real case. For d > 0, consider the random variable Xd supported on
{0, d} with

P (Xd = d) =

ed − 1 − d

Lemma 2.1. Let X be a real random variable such that a ≤ X ≤ b. Then

|E eX−E X − 1| ≤ G(b − a) ≤ e(b−a)2/8 − 1,

where the ﬁrst inequality holds with equality if and only if X = Xb−a + a almost surely.

2.1 The complex case: tight bound for small diameter

Let Z1, . . . , Zn be complex random variables and let c1, . . . , cn be nonnegative real numbers
with c1 + ··· + cn = 1. Deﬁne the mixture Z = Mixc1,...,cn(Z1, . . . , Zn) by

P (Z ∈ A) =

ck P (Zk ∈ A)

n(cid:88)

k=1

for every measurable set A ⊆ C. A standard property of mixtures is that

E F(cid:0)Mixc1,...,cn(Z1, . . . , Zn)(cid:1) =

n(cid:88)

cj E F (Zj)

(2.1)

for any measurable function F : C → C for which the expectations exist.

Let Zd be the class of all complex random variables Z with E Z = 0 and diam Z ≤ d, and
d be the subclass of Zd consisting of those variables supported on at most k points.

let Z (k)
Lemma 2.2. Let F : {z ∈ C | |z| ≤ d} → C be continuous. Then

j=1

sup
Z∈Zd

|E F (Z)| = sup
Z∈Z (3)

d

|E F (Z)|.

Proof. This is an example of the “Carath´eodory Principle”, see for example [3, 6, 7]. Since
we didn’t ﬁnd a statement in the literature that exactly matches our needs, we outline the
proof.

First, by a simple induction, any Z ∈ Zd with ﬁnite support can be written as a mixture
of members of Z (3)
d . This is true because, for any ﬁnite set of points in C having the origin
in its convex hull, there is a subset of three or fewer points having the origin in its convex
hull. By (2.1), this implies that the lemma holds when Z has ﬁnite support.

For more arbitrary Z ∈ Zd, we can use the continuity of F to show that for any ε > 0
there is Z(cid:48) ∈ Zd of ﬁnite support such that E Z(cid:48) = 0 and |E F (Z) − E F (Z(cid:48))| ≤ ε. Allowing
ε to tend to 0 completes the proof.

We now return to Hoeﬀding’s bound using Lemma 2.2 for F (z) = ez − 1. Obviously
|E eZ−E Z − 1| = 0 if Z is constant, so we need to consider the cases of 2-point and 3-point
supports. Since a random variable supported on 3 collinear points is a mixture of two random
variables supported on 2 points, in the case of 3 points only the non-collinear case needs to
be considered.

d , then |E eZ − 1| ≤ G(d).

Lemma 2.3. If Z ∈ Z (2)
Proof. The case of real Z is treated in Lemma 2.1. More generally, since E Z = 0, Z = eiθX
where X is real. Since E X = 0, there are x, x(cid:48) ≥ 0 such that X has support −x with
probability x(cid:48)/(x + x(cid:48)) and x(cid:48) with probability x/(x + x(cid:48)). For any odd k we can calculate
that

E X k =

xk

1 + ρ

(ρk − ρ), where ρ = x(cid:48)/x.

This shows that either X or −X has only nonnegative moments. By adding π to θ if
necessary, we assume that the former holds. Now, recalling that E Z = E X = 0, we can
calculate

E X k = E eX − 1,

which implies that |E eZ − 1| ≤ G(d) by the real case.

The case of a support of three points is considerably more diﬃcult. To begin, deﬁne

d0 = sup{d ∈ R | (cid:60) E eZ ≥ 0 for all Z ∈ Zd}.

Since (cid:60)ez ≥ 0 for |z| ≤ π/2 we see that d0 ≥ π/2. The actual value is almost twice as large.
Lemma 2.4. d0 ≈ 3.120491233.
Proof. By applying Lemma 2.2 to F (z) = ed − (cid:60)z, we see that only supports of two points
or three non-collinear points need to be considered.
For supports of two points, we have by deﬁnition

(cid:60)(cid:0)xe(cid:96)(1−x)eiθ + (1 − x)e−(cid:96)xeiθ(cid:1).

inf{(cid:60) E eZ | Z ∈ Z (2)

d } =

inf

(cid:96)∈[0,d],x∈[0,1],θ∈[−π,π]

There appears to be no closed form for the inﬁmum. However, careful numerical computation
shows that the inﬁmum crosses 0 at d = d2 ≈ 3.120491233, which occurs when (cid:96) = d,
x ≈ 0.636527202 and θ ≈ 1.9198934984.

If d0 < d2, there is some d < d0 such that
0 < inf{(cid:60) E eZ | Z ∈ Z (3)

d }.
d } < inf{(cid:60) E eZ | Z ∈ Z (2)

By the compactness of Z (3)

same support, but mean at x + iy (thus Z = Z0,0). As is well known, x, y determine the
probabilities at z1, z2, z3 linearly, so for some complex constants A, B, C we have

E eZ(x,y)−E Z(x,y) − 1 = e−x−iy(Ax + By + C) − 1

= C − 1 + (A − C)x + (B − iC)y + O(x2 + y2),

(2.2)

valid whenever x + iy lies in the convex hull of {z1, z2, z3}.

In order for Z to be a local minimum for the real part, the coeﬃcients of x and y in (2.2)
must be purely imaginary. Therefore, for some v, w ∈ R, A = C + iv and B = iC + iw.
Substituting in these values and writing C = c0 + ic1 we ﬁnd

where

R =

E(cid:60)eZ(x,y)−(x+iy) = c0 + [x, y]R[x, y]T + O(|x|3 + |y|3),

The smallest eigenvalue of R is 1
c0 > 0. Thus (x, y) = (0, 0) is not a local minimum for E(cid:60) eZ(x,y)−E Z(x,y), contrary to our
assumption. This proves that d0 = d2.
Theorem 2.1. If diam Z = d ≤ d0, then |E eZ − 1| ≤ G(d).

d

Proof. We can rely on continuity to assume that d < d0.
By Lemma 2.2 with F (z) = ez − 1, we have supZ∈Zd

|E eZ − 1|, and
by compactness the supremum is achieved for some Z ∈ Z (3)
d . We ﬁrst show that no such
local maximum occurs when the support consists of 3 non-collinear points, implying that it
occurs in Z (2)

|E eZ − 1| = supZ∈Z (3)

d . By Lemma 2.3, this will complete the proof.

So, suppose that the maximum value of |E eZ − 1| for Z ∈ Z (3)

d where the support of Z
consists of three non-collinear points. Let Z(x,y) be the random variable with the same
support as Z, but mean at x + iy. As in the proof of Lemma 2.4, (2.2) holds. Since we are
assuming this to be a local maximum for |E eZ − 1|, A − C and B − iC must be orthogonal
to C − 1, i.e. real multiples of i(C − 1). That is, for some v, w ∈ R, A = C + iv(C − 1) and
B = iC + iw(C − 1). Substituting in these values, writing C = c0 + ic1 for c0, c1 ∈ R, and
deﬁning ∆ = |C − 1| we can expand

(cid:12)(cid:12)E eZ(x,y)−E Z(x,y) − 1(cid:12)(cid:12)2 = |C − 1|2 + [x, y]Q[x, y]T + O(|x|3 + |y|3),

(cid:35)

.

where

Q =

∆v2 + c0 − c2
∆vw − c1

1 − c2

0

∆vw − c1
∆w2 + c0 − 1

We now show that Q cannot be negative semideﬁnite. If ∆ = 0 then E eZ − 1 = 0, which
is clearly not a maximum, so assume ∆ > 0. The trace of Q is ∆(v2 + w2 − 1), which is

5

determinant of Q is ∆(cid:0)−w2c2

impossible for a negative semideﬁnite matrix if v2 + w2 > 1, so assume v2 + w2 ≤ 1. The

0 − (1− v2 − w2)c0 − (v − wc1)2(cid:1), which is negative (since d < d0

implies c0 > 0), which is also impossible for a negative semideﬁnite matrix. Therefore, there
is no local maximum here and the proof is complete.

We have no reason to believe that Theorem 2.1 requires the condition d ≤ d0, and expect
that it is true for all d. However, the same proof is insuﬃcient since it is possible for local
maxima to occur for supports of three points. However, we can now complete the proof of
Theorem 1.1 for all d.

2.2 Proof of Theorem 1.1

We need two technical bounds whose uninteresting proofs are omitted, and a standard result
on planar sets.
Lemma 2.5. For t ≥ 3 we have

G(t) + 1 ≤ 0.9 et2/8 .

(cid:112)G(2t) + 1 ≤ 1.65 et2/8

Lemma 2.6. Let Z be a bounded complex random variable. Then Z is almost surely conﬁned
to some closed disk of radius 1√

diam Z.

3

Proof. This follows from a standard result on convex sets, see [5, Thm. 12.3] for example.
An equilateral triangle shows that the constant cannot be reduced.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. For d ≤ 3, the theorem follows from Theorem 2.1, so we can assume
that d ≥ 3.

By Lemma 2.6, there is some a ∈ C such that |Z − a| ≤ 1√

on |E ZeZ|. First we argue that

where we used Lemma 2.1 to bound E e2(cid:60)Z, and (2.4).

Taking the average of (2.5) and (2.6), we have

ded2/8(cid:0)0.45 + 0.825αβ + 0.825(cid:112)(1 − α2)(1 − β2)(cid:1)

|E ZeZ| ≤ 1√

We can now complete the proof. We have

E eZ − 1 = E e3Z/d − 1 +

E ZesZ ds.

Since diam(3Z/d) ≤ 3, we have by Theorem 2.1 that |E e3Z/d − 1| ≤ e32/8 − 1, and since we
are assuming that d ≥ 3, (2.7) gives that |E ZeZ| ≤ 1

|E eZ − 1| ≤ e32/8 − 1 +

In conclusion, we note some questions that we have not answered. Our prediction that
Theorem 2.1 holds for all d is one of them. We can also ask for an exact description of the
