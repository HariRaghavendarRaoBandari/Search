Abstract. The next generation of atomic frequency standards based on an ensemble of neutral
atoms or a single-ion will provide very stringent tests in metrology, applied and fundamental
physics requiring a new step in very precise control of external systematic corrections.
In
the proceedings of the 8th Symposium on Frequency Standards and Metrology, we present a
generalization of the recent Hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy with separated oscillating ﬁelds using
composites pulses in order to suppress ﬁeld frequency shifts induced by the interrogation laser
itself. Sequences of laser pulses including speciﬁc selection of phases, frequency detunings
and durations are elaborated to generate spectroscopic signals with a strong reduction of the
light-shift perturbation by oﬀ resonant states. New optical clocks based on weakly allowed or
completely forbidden transitions in atoms, ions, molecules and nuclei will beneﬁt from these
generalized Ramsey schemes to reach relative accuracies well below the 10−18 level.

1. Introduction
The story of very high precision laser pulsed spectroscopy has started in 1930 with the atomic and
molecular beam resonance method invented by I.I. Rabi to improve the resolution of frequency
measurements [1]. Under a quasi-resonant irradiation, a quantum two-level system can undergo
coherent Rabi oscillations.
In this case, the initial two-level occupation probabilities can be
inverted by a so-called π pulse with an adequate selection of laser ﬁeld frequency and pulse
duration. By scanning the frequency of the irradiation around the exact resonance, a narrow
spectroscopic resonance is observed that can be used to realize a very precise discriminator
stabilizing a local frequency oscillator to the atomic or molecular transition. To improve even
further the frequency resolution, N.F. Ramsey has proposed to replace the single oscillatory
ﬁeld by a double microwave excitation pulse with π/2 pulses separated by a free evolution time
[2] as schematized in Fig. 1. The main advantage of the two-pulse Ramsey spectroscopy is to
reduce the probing electromagnetic ﬁeld perturbation on the atomic transition itself which has
drastically impacted the time and frequency metrology with microwave atomic clocks since the
1950s [3].

Figure 1. (color online). Quantum system with a narrow |gi ↔ |ei clock transition probed
by a single laser pulse excitation. The unperturbed clock detuning is introduced by δ and
the Rabi frequency is Ω. The usual pulse area is deﬁned by the product Ωτ . Rabi and Ramsey
spectroscopy are two laser probing techniques generating a frequency discriminator for an atomic
clock. The full width at half maximum is deﬁned by δν1/2.

Optical frequency-standards are today actively developed to replace microwave transitions by
very narrow optical resonances in single ion, fermionic and bosonic alkaline-earth atoms [4]. Very
long storage time of Doppler and recoil free quantum particles have been achieved using laser
cooling techniques and the level of 10−18 relative accuracy will be probably almost achieved in
the near future [5]. As an example, the lattice fermionic clock requires now a very precise control
of atomic interactions to cancel some systematic frequency shifts below the relative 10−17 level of
accuracy [6, 7]. Light-shifts represent a non negligeable issue for clocks based on bosonic neutral
atoms with forbidden dipole transitions activated by mixing static magnetic ﬁeld with a single
laser [8, 9], for clocks with magic-wave induced transition in even isotopes [10] or with a E1-M1
two-photon laser excitation [11, 12, 13]. Because these important issues have to be addressed for
bosons, we present in these proceedings a generalization of the Ramsey spectroscopy to reduce
at a very low level of correction the light-shift induced by the probing laser itself on the atomic
resonance.

2. Clock frequency shift in a generalized Ramsey two-pulse spectroscopy
In a Ramsey laser spectroscopy deﬁned by two pulses with eﬀective area θl (l = i,k), the single
Rabi’s π pulse interaction zone is splitting into two very short π/2 pulses with duration τ
separated by a free evolution time T. The atoms spend a much shorter time in the presence
of the external electromagnetic ﬁelds minimizing inhomogeneities which may reduce precision
in determining the transition frequency. When we consider a light-shift eﬀect during the laser
pulses, Ramsey spectroscopy renormalizes the light perturbation by the factor τ /T . If Ramsey
fringes are largely shifted by oﬀ-resonant states, an additional laser frequency step may be
applied to rectify the anticipated shift, thus requiring a redeﬁnition of frequency detunings as

δl = δ + ∆l. The uncompensated residual contribution ∆l present during pulses leads to a net
clock frequency-shift of the central fringe expressed as:

δν = −

Φ(δ → 0, ∆l)

2πT

(1)

where Φ(δ → 0, ∆l) is the zero order phase-shift aﬀecting the central fringe when the unperturbed
clock detuning δ between the laser frequency and the atomic transition is closed to zero. If we
simply consider the extension of the two-pulse conﬁguration, as in the initial Hyper-Ramsey
scheme with diﬀerent pulse areas [14], we found the global phase-shift expression as [13]:

ΦHR = arctan" δi

tan θi + δk

l . The uncompensated part of the
residual light-shift correction becomes proportional to the laser pulse area and is reduced to usual

1 − δiδk
where the eﬀective area is θl = ωlτl/2 and ωl =qδ2
Ramsey phase-shift ΦR = 2 arctan(cid:2) ∆
and δi = δk ≡ ∆. Such a linear dependence with π/2 pulses versus the uncompensated part of
the light perturbation is shown by the solid blue line in Fig. 2. The frequency shift response is
usually observed in microwave atomic clocks using Ramsey spectroscopy [3]. More importantly,
there is another pulse conﬁguration which was never studied by Ramsey to strongly reduce the
frequency-shift induced by the laser probe itself. By selecting in Eq. 2 eﬀective pulse areas such

that θi = θ and θk = 3θ taking for example a pulse duration τ three times longer during the
ﬁnal pulse, we observe a nonlinear clock frequency-shift of the central Ramsey fringe versus the
residual correction ∆ shown by the solid black line in Fig. 2. The non standard reduction of the
residual light-shift perturbation is produced by a combination of pulse areas θ ∼ π/4 (Ωτ = π/2)
and θ ∼ 3π/4 (Ωτ = 3π/2) in Eq. 2. The linear dependence of the clock frequency shift on small
variations of the light-shifts is totally removed except for a residual cubic correction originated
by the phase of Eq. 2. However, a relative pulse area modiﬁcation by ±10% is still aﬀecting the
result if it is not well compensated.

3. Generalized Hyper-Ramsey clock frequency shift with composite laser pulses
Generalization of the Ramsey scheme from the original two-pulse conﬁguration [2] to more
complex ones including additional intermediate pulses permits to reduce shifts and broadening
due to inhomogeneous excitation conditions or shifts that are the result of the excitation itself
[15, 16]. Sequence of three excitation pulses θl (l = i,j,k) shown in Fig. 3(a) with suitably selected
frequency δl and phase steps ϕl have been introduced in order to reduce the light-shift and to
eﬃciently suppress the sensitivity of the spectroscopic signal to variations of the probe light
intensity [14, 17]. These new schemes, based on the Generalized Hyper-Ramsey (GHR) resonance
reported in Fig. 3(b), have been tested experimentally for few clock transitions as the ultra-
narrow electric octupole transition in the 171Yb+ clock [18]. Composite pulses inspired by NMR
techniques are used to compensate simultaneously for noise decoherence, pulse area ﬂuctuation
and residual frequency oﬀset due to the applied laser ﬁeld itself. The ﬁrst or the second pulse
of the usual Ramsey sequence can be separated in two or more contiguous sections which yield
to new eﬃcient probing protocols with more degrees of freedom to minimize resonance shifts.

The key point is to establish some eﬃcient quantum control protocols which compensate for
frequency-shift. Moreover the quantum control protocols have to be robust to small change in
pulse area while achieving a highly contrasted population transfer between the targeted states
[14, 17]. By imposing speciﬁc pulse areas in Eq. 3 as θi = θk = θ (Ωτ = π/2) and θj = 2θ
(Ωτ = π) while ﬁxing laser ﬁeld phases at ϕi = ϕk = 0 and ϕj = π (Ω → −Ω) during
the intermediate pulse, a very good compensation of the ±10% relative pulse area variation is
demonstrated as reported in Fig. 4.
It seems that combinations of generalized Hyper-Ramsey spectral resonances including
some phase-step controls and diﬀerent pulse durations may demonstrate in the future their
capacity to eliminate systematic corrections including potential biases or higher-order light-shift
contributions from the probe laser. The next generation of optical clocks based on weakly allowed
or completely forbidden transitions in atoms, ions, molecules and nuclei will beneﬁt from these

Generalized Hyper-Ramsey resonance with separated oscillating ﬁelds has also been extended
to bosonic three-levels systems using optical stimulated Raman transitions [13] and some recent
modiﬁed Hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy schemes based on various phase-step modulations of laser
pulses have been proposed to completely eliminate the light-shift in optical clocks [19, 20, 21].
