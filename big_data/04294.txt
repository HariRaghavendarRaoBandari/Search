NGC 5195 IN M51: FEEDBACK ‘BURPS’ AFTER A MASSIVE MEAL?

Draft version March 15, 2016

ABSTRACT

We describe a double-arc-like X-ray structure lying ∼15 − 30′′ (∼0.8-1.7 kpc) south of the NGC 5195
nucleus visible in the merged exposures of long Chandra pointings of M51. The curvature and orientation
of the arcs argues for a nuclear origin. The arcs are radially separated by ∼15′′(∼1 kpc), but are rotated
relative to each other by ∼30◦. From an archival image, we ﬁnd a slender Hα-emitting region just outside
the outer edge of the outer X-ray arc, suggesting that the X-ray-emitting gas plowed up and displaced
the Hα-emitting material from the galaxy core. Star formation may have commenced in that arc. Hα
emission is present at the inner arc, but appears more complex in structure. In contrast to an explosion
expected to be azimuthally symmetric, the X-ray arcs suggest a focused outﬂow. We interpret the arcs
as episodic outbursts from the central super-massive black hole (SMBH). We conclude that NGC 5195
represents the nearest galaxy exhibiting on-going, large-scale outﬂows of gas, in particular, two episodes
of a focused outburst of the SMBH. The arcs represent a clear demonstration of feedback.

introduction

Through both observations and simulations, signiﬁcant
progress has been made in understanding the role of su-
permassive black holes in galaxy evolution.
It is now
widely accepted that at high redshifts, galaxies undergo
an active period of gas cooling, star formation and rapid
black hole growth through radiatively eﬃcient accretion.
This quasar phase is generally followed by radiatively
ineﬃcient accretion of material onto the SMBH, with
the energy from the SMBH primarily released mechani-
cally through radio-emitting jets that can inﬂate bubbles
in the hot atmospheres that surround massive elliptical
galaxies (Churazov 2005; for recent reviews, see Fabian
(2012), hereafter F12; or King & Pounds (2015), hereafter
KP2015). While many examples of AGN outbursts from
SMBHs in massive elliptical galaxies have been found from
Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, in this paper we
present the ﬁrst evidence for episodic outbursts from the
central black hole in the nearby (8 Mpc), relatively low-
mass early-type galaxy NGC 5195. NGC 5195 (M51B),
along with the grand-design spiral NGC 5194 (M51A),
form the Messier 51 interacting system.

Much of the attention given to M51 focuses on the spi-
ral NGC 5194. The less-photogenic companion NGC 5195
is variously typed as an SB0-1, Irregular, or LINER (e.g.,
NED.ipac.caltech.edu, de Vaucouleurs, et al. 1991). The
nucleus of NGC 5195 is detected in every wavelength from
X-rays to radio. NGC 5195 tends to receive less attention
because of the signiﬁcant dust component that is suﬃ-
ciently dense to virtually hide the nature of the galaxy
(Van Dyk 1987).

Here we describe an X-ray-bright, double-arc extended
structure lying ∼15 − 30′′ south of the nucleus of NGC
5195 that is visible in deep Chandra observations of M51
(PI K. Kuntz). We interpret the double-arc structure to

originate from episodic outﬂows which have ‘snow-plowed’
Hα-emitting material,
from the galaxy’s core. Given
the cosmologically recent interaction of NGC 5195 and
NGC 5194, estimated to have occurred 50-100 Myr ago
(Salo & Laurikainen 2000), the structure immediately sug-
gests a reaction to the forced feeding of the SMBH in NGC
5195.

Estimates of the distance to M51 range from 7.9 Mpc,
derived from the expanding photospheres method for
core-collapse supernovae (Bose & Kumar 2014), to 8.4
Mpc, based on the planetary nebula luminosity function
(Feldmeier et al. 1997). We adopt a distance to M51 of 8
Mpc.

2. data and analysis

2.1. Data Preparation

The Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer
(ACIS) observations of M51 used in this study were ob-
tained from the Chandra archive and are listed in Table 1.
Seven long pointings were obtained in Faint mode and to-
tal ∼760.2 ksec. Three observations, totaling 84 ksec, were
obtained in Very Faint mode and are discussed in §2.2
below. We do not analyze two observations: a short 2-
ksec observation obtained in Faint mode (ObsID 414) and
a ∼10 ksec observation (ObsID 12562) obtained in Very
Faint mode in which NGC 5195 falls in the gap between
the ACIS-I and ACIS-S CCDs. These observations are not
included in our analysis as they add little or no signal.

Data preparations were all carried out using the Chan-
dra Interactive Analysis of Observations (CIAO) software
package and followed the recommended processing. Each
ObsID was examined for times of high particle back-
ground. Although no such periods were found, short time
intervals were trimmed at the start and end to eliminate
possible residuals; the trimmed times sum to <0.1% of

the total exposure. Gain calibrations were checked and
found to match. The data were energy-ﬁltered to include
only events between 0.4 and 8 keV. Given the multiple
pointings, the absolute positions of a given ObsID may
diﬀer slightly from the others. Consequently, we arbitrar-
ily adopted ObsID 13814 (the longest exposure) as our
reference. The CIAO task merge obs was used to place
all frames into a common reference, construct exposure
maps for each observation, and merge the exposure maps
and event ﬁles to build a ﬂux image.

Point sources above a ﬂux of ≈5×10−16 erg s−1 cm−2
(corresponding luminosity at the distance of M51 is
≈4×1036 erg s−1) were ﬁltered out from all subsequent
analyses. This limit means that the seven bright
sources seen in the ﬁeld are all ﬁltered from the
data. Five of the sources are too distant to have
any impact on the spectra or proﬁles of the arcs.
A 6th source lies too far west of the western edge
of the inner arc to have any impact – the source
is ∼15” W of the edge while the 90% encircled en-
ergy radius at its position is ∼4”. The 7th point
source sits just S of the nucleus on the east edge
of the inner arc. Again, the 90% encircled energy
radius of ≈4 arcsec, while contaminating some of
the arc emission, remains small relative to the to-
tal size of the inner arc. Consequently, the western
half of the arc is uncontaminated by point source
emission.

2.2. X-ray Imaging

The overall ﬁeld is shown in Figure 1(a). The nuclei
of NGC 5194 and NGC 5195 are labeled ‘A’ and ‘B,’ re-
spectively. NGC 5194 is nearly centered in the ﬁeld, so
the majority of the galaxy is covered by the image. Also
visible is the X-ray emission from a prominent spiral arm
lying between the nuclei (discussed in Vega et al. (2016)).
The nucleus of NGC 5195 lies just inside the ACIS ﬁeld
of the merged F-mode exposures (Figure 1). In all subse-
quent discussion, the two X-ray arcs are labeled as ‘inner,’
to describe the one closest to the nucleus of NGC 5195, and
‘outer’. Point sources at the east end of both the inner and
outer arcs are removed from the analysis of the spectrum
and ﬂux of the respective arc as mentioned previously.

The arcs are separated from the nucleus by ∼780 (∼15′′)
and 1700 pc (∼30′′), respectively (Table 2). The two arcs
have broadly comparable curvature: the inner arc spans
∼50-60 degrees (position angles ∼180-240 degrees mea-
sured Eastward from North), while the outer arc spans
∼40-50 degrees (position angles ∼160-210 degrees). The
curvatures are consistent with an origin at or near the
SMBH. The outer arc is approximately centered on a line
joining the nuclei of NGC 5195 and NGC 5194, but the in-
ner arc is centered on a line rotated ∼30 degrees counter-
clockwise from the NGC 5194/5195 line. Note also that
the inner arc is brighter than the outer arc by about a
factor of two (§2.4.3), consistent with expanding gas. The
curvature, coupled with the inner vs outer brightnesses,
suggests a nuclear outburst or similar expulsion of matter
with the emission becoming fainter as the gas expands.
The presence of the two arcs suggests two episodes of
SMBH-driven outﬂows. We discuss other possibilities to
explain this structure later in this section.

While we can measure the length and width of each
arc, the thickness thick is unknown. We adopt a thick-
ness of 100 thick100 pc at the front edge of the outer arc
– a speciﬁc thickness at the outer edge leads to a con-
stant opening angle. If the arcs were a very broad angular
hemispheric ‘fan’, signiﬁcant X-ray emission would exist
between the arc and the nucleus, but we do not detect such
emission. Instead, we detect emission that is length- and
width-restricted. The width restriction implies an episode;
the length restriction implies an angular constriction in a
ﬂow with unknown depth or thickness. An explosion is
expected to be azimuthally symmetric, but the arcs to the
south are not, appearing instead to be two episodes of a
‘focused’ outﬂow.

The 85-ksec ACIS VF mode data are shown in Fig-
ure 1(c). The data provide a glimpse north of the NGC
5195 nucleus; a ‘glimpse’ because the signal-to-noise in the
ACIS VF observation is low. X-ray structure exists to the
North, however, it does not appear to be arc-like, but in-
stead V- or fan-shaped with the point of the V toward the
SMBH. If the density to the north decreases suﬃciently
quickly, a bubble expanding northward could open, possi-
bly leading to a V- or fan-shaped structure.

Are there alternative explanations at this point? One
could interpret the structure as weak point source(s) plus
diﬀuse emission. However, this structure is not consistent
with blended point sources, even for the Chandra point
spread function ∼4′ oﬀ-axis. We note, however, that our
PSF analysis applies only to sources above ≈100 counts
as fainter ones are inseparable from the diﬀuse emission
at this oﬀ-axis angle. A deﬁnitive analysis requires an on-
axis observation. Another possibility is induced star
formation within the arcs; we discuss this inter-
pretation in §2.5 after presenting observations in
other wavelengths.

A similarly-shaped, fan-like structure also appears to
the north in a continuum-subtracted Hα image of NGC
5195 presented in Kaisin & Karachentsev (2008) and the
Hα image from Hoopes et al. (2001). We discuss the Hα
image in §2.5.

2.3. Surface Brightness Proﬁles of the X-ray Arcs

Figure 2 displays the surface brightness proﬁles across
both X-ray arcs. Each proﬁle was built by extracting
counts using an azimuthally-constrained annular region
similar to that shown in Figure 1(b), but with a larger
number of annuli.

The proﬁles were extracted by matching angular an-
nuli to the shape of the outer edge, then dividing the
region interior to that edge into 20 segments identically
shaped. Leaving aside the detector background, there are
two source backgrounds to consider: the real cosmic back-
ground well-away from M51, and the diﬀuse background
of NGC 5195. The counts in radial bins lying outside
the outer edges of the arcs represent the galaxy back-
ground. The inner arc borders closely on the outer arc.
Consequently the background radial bin of the inner arc
is shorter to avoid overlap with the outer arc. Finally, the
cosmic background was adopted as a large region WSW
of NGC 5195 and suﬃciently separated (∼2.5 arcmin)
to avoid any contamination from point sources or diﬀuse
emission from the galaxy.

The surface brightness proﬁles are similar in shape: rel-
atively ﬂat as a function of radius out to the outside edge,
then dropping quickly to the level of the ISM. That be-
havior describes a shock. The large oﬀ-axis angle means
the point spread function is broad at this location (50%
encircled energy width of the PSF ∼2-2.5 arcsec; Chan-
dra Proposers Guide). Consequently, the arcs are blurred;
to ascertain their shape more accurately will require an
on-axis observation.

2.4. Spectral Fitting

We extract spectra from the two arcs as well
as the nucleus for the purpose of comparing their
temperatures and absorption properties.

2.4.1. Overall Spectral Fitting

We adopted the CCD S7 blank-sky background repro-
jected onto the reference frame of NGC 5195. We used
the blank background because (i) M51 essentially covers
the back-illuminated CCD S7, reducing the area available
for an on-chip background; and (ii) possible Si ﬂuores-
cence within the instrument must be assessed to deter-
mine whether Si emission is present in the source spectra.
We followed the CXC-deﬁned analysis thread to reproject
that background into the reference frame of the merged
observation, a procedure based on Hickox & Markevitch
(2006). We also matched the particle backgrounds, using
events in the 10-12 keV range, of the M51 and blank-sky
observations as described in the Hickox & Markevitch anal-
ysis. Finally, we veriﬁed the normalization by extracting
a background spectrum from the corners of CCD S7. The
corner spectrum has lower signal-to-noise, but does verify
that the reprojected data match the observed background.
The spectra for the overall diﬀuse emission and the back-
grounds were extracted using the regions shown in Fig-
ure 1(b). The extraction region for the nucleus was a cir-
cle centered on the nucleus of radius 9 arc secs. Detected
point sources were removed from the source regions using
excluded regions corresponding to >97% of the on-axis
point spread function (Chandra Proposer’s Guide). Re-
sponse matrices and eﬀective area ﬁles were built for each
source and background region. The data were binned to
15 counts per bin leading to ≈225 channels in the diﬀuse
spectra, of which ≈80 cover the 0.4-2 keV band, and ≈480
channels in the nuclear spectrum of which ≈180 cover the
0.4-2 keV band.

The source + background and background spectra were
ﬁt simultaneously, ensuring the best measure of the ﬂux
for the source. We used XSPEC package v12.8 (Arnaud
1996) and the C statistic (Cash 1979). We adopted a power
law for the background model with several gaussians to
mimic small ﬂuorescence features in the spectrum. Once
the model parameters were ﬁt, we ﬁxed all except the nor-
malizations for a simultaneous ﬁt of the source + back-
ground and background spectra. We describe the nuclear
spectrum ﬁrst because we must refer to it when discussing
the spectra of the arcs.

2.4.2. Nucleus Spectrum and Luminosity

For the nucleus, we adopted an absorbed power law typ-
ical of AGN and included an optically-thin gas model (de-
scribed in §2.4.3 below) because our extraction region in-
cludes some surrounding gas. We tested the signiﬁcance of

3

the gas component: a pure power law model signiﬁcantly
fails to ﬁt the data, while the combined components do.

The column density was a free parameter with a ﬁtted
value of ∼1.5×1021 cm−2. This value is in close agreement
with the value implied by the column density of K I mea-
sured by Ritchey & Wallerstein (2015). The observed lu-
minosity of the nucleus in the 0.5-2 keV band is ∼3.3×1038
ergs s−1 (unabsorbed LX ). This value indicates that the
NGC 5195 SMBH must be in a radiatively ineﬃcient state
(see §3).

2.4.3. X-ray Arc Spectra and Luminosities

For the X-ray arc spectra, we adopted an absorbed,
optically-thin thermal gas model with variable abundances
(vapec in XSPEC). We adopted a power-law compo-
nent to ﬁt any residual nuclear or un-removed X-
ray binary emission in the arc spectra. We also
adopted a ﬁxed value for the index (1.6; Gilfanov
2004). The resulting ﬁt yields an upper limit on
the presence of a power law component in both
arcs. All of the ﬁtted model parameters are listed in
Table 3.
Initial, fully-unconstrained ﬁts to the spectra
showed repeated consistency for the arcs’ temperatures,
normalizations, and abundance values, but not for the col-
umn densities.

We initially ﬁxed the column density at a value of
2.1×1020 cm−2, the Galactic column in the direction of
NGC 5195 from Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011). We did
so because an unconstrained ﬁt did not converge
on a ﬁxed value of the column. Once we reached
a ’best-ﬁt’ state, we also explored ﬁts with the
column densities of the arcs ﬁxed between the
Galactic column and the nuclear value. The tem-
peratures, abundances, and model normalizations
are consistent with any value between the known
Galactic column and the ﬁtted nuclear column (0.2
to 1.6×1021 cm−2). To undertake a proper ﬁt for
the column density will require either (i) additional
X-ray data; (ii) an on-axis observation; or (iii) ad-
ditional constraints (such as a measured value for
the reddening, EB −V ).

The initial ﬁts were also done for temperature and nor-
malization with abundances ﬁxed at solar (= 1.0). Then
each abundance in turn was ﬁt. Abundance values that
were consistent with 1.0 were ﬁxed at 1.0. Once the abun-
dances were determined, a ﬁnal ﬁt was done with tempera-
ture, normalization, and any non-solar abundances as free
parameters. Errors at the 90% level on each parameter
were then determined.

We found the gas temperatures for the two arcs diﬀer,
with the outer arc cooler (0.41+0.06
−0.03 keV) than the inner
arc (0.65+0.04
−0.03 keV) (Figure 3) – the outer arc has had a
longer time to expand and to cool, as well as plowing into
more material that enhances the cooling. The ﬁtted model
normalizations also support one’s visual impression that
the outer arc is fainter – they diﬀer by a factor of ≈1.5
with the outer arc having a smaller normalization. The
0.5-2 keV luminosities calculated from the ﬁtted models
are L38∼1.5 (outer) and L38∼2.3 (inner) in 1038 erg/sec
units.

The nucleus and both arcs exhibit Ne enhanced rela-
tive to a solar value. While the arc values are higher,

4

within the errors, they are consistent with the nuclear
value. However, both arcs also exhibit enhanced values
for Mg of 2.5-3.5 times solar. Additionally, the inner arc
has an enhanced value for oxygen of 3.3 (Table 3). That
the arcs exhibit enhanced O and Mg abundances suggests
the outﬂow has swept up material from prior phases of
stellar mass loss. The enhanced Ne found in the nucleus
and the arcs could indicate some nucleosynthetic process-
ing occurred before the gas was expelled.

2.5. Multi-wavelength Observations

The X-ray observations are more easily interpreted if
placed in context with the emission from other wave-
lengths. The position of the NGC 5195 nucleus is suf-
ﬁciently well-determined, in spite of its near CCD-edge
position, that it and the arc structures may be compared
with images at other wavebands. The nuclear source cor-
responds within a few arc seconds to the positions of the
nuclear source in the data sets from the Swift UVOT, DSS2
(blue), WISE 6µ, and VLA FIRST images (Figure 4).

Most other wavelengths reveal little structure at the lo-
cation of the arcs, particularly if the band is a continuum
or has a wide wavelength coverage. Necessarily, that state-
ment depends on the degree to which the images in other
bands provide suﬃcient dynamic range in the area of the
sky where the arcs are located (e.g., WISE 6µ image has
insuﬃcient resolution to discern; DSS2 is over-exposed in
the same region).

However, three images are intriguing. First, the 6 cm
VLA image (Figure 4) shows a broad arc SE of the nu-
cleus of NGC 5195 at approximately the distance of the
outer X-ray arc. The breadth of the radio arc is likely tied
to the resolution of the conﬁguration used (VLA conﬁgu-
ration ‘D’) for the observation. Second, the Swift UVOT
image (Figure 4) exhibits a structure to the north of NGC
5195 at a distance from the nucleus comparable to the dis-
tance between the nucleus and the inner arc. The UVOT
structure resembles a single broad arc, suggesting a pos-
sible symmetric expulsion of matter. That interpretation
leaves a puzzle: why are there two X-ray-visible arcs to
the South and a single UV-visible arc to the North?

The third interesting image is Hα (Hoopes et al. 2001;
retrieved from the NASA Extragalactic Database; Fig-
ures 4, 5). A slender Hα arc and a second, less well-
deﬁned structure are visible near the regions of the X-ray
arcs. The slender Hα arc lies outside the outer X-ray arc,
implying ‘snow-plowed,’ or swept-up material by the ex-
panding plasma driven by the AGN outﬂow. Based on a
single spectrum obtained in 1998 with the spectrograph’s
slit lying approximately across the Hα arc (their ‘slit 4’),
Hoopes & Walterbos (2003) conclude that the spectral be-
havior is indicative of an expanding structure or outﬂow,
but that ‘the mechanism for such an outﬂow is unclear.’
The same authors also note that this region exhibits high
[N II]/Hα, [S II]/Hα, and [O III]/Hβ, with values higher
than in the diﬀuse gas elsewhere in the galaxy. Those
emission lines are indicative of shocked emission.

The presence of the Hα emission plus the shock
indicators support an interpretation of the X-ray
arcs as resulting from shocks driving the Hα emis-
sion outward. Earlier, we raised the possibility
that the arcs originate from collision-induced star

formation. We interpret the shape of the Hα emis-
sion and its location immediately outside the outer
X-ray arc as support for the outgoing blast wave
interpretation, rather than in situ collision-induced
star formation activity.

to
date either demonstrate a glancing collision with
NGC 5195 passing by on a hyperbolic trajec-
tory (Toomre & Toomre 1972), or that there have
been multiple encounters with the two galaxies
in high-eccentricity orbits
(Salo & Laurikainen
2000). None of the simulations we have seen to
date have been done with suﬃcient resolution to
investigate detailed gas motions.

The outer Hα arc is ≈1660 pc in length (Table 2). Along
the length of the arc, the width is ≈5′′ or ≈200 parsecs.
Measured velocities ranged from 500-600 km s−1. This arc
also exhibits what appear to be two or three small H II
regions, suggesting the outer arc has plowed suﬃcient ma-
terial to trigger star formation.

3. discussion

The X-ray arcs represent a clear case of feedback from
the SMBH: it almost certainly cannot be a coincidence
that the arcs arise in a galaxy that is known to possess a
SMBH and has undergone at least one interaction with a
nearby galaxy in the past ≈108 years. In that, the obser-
vations presented here for NGC 5195 appear broadly to
match observations of outﬂows observed in other systems,
as we describe at the end of this section.

Large-scale AGN feedback plays essential roles in galaxy
evolution. In the initial quasar phase, there is very rapid
growth of the central black hole through radiatively eﬃ-
cient accretion, along with active star formation. Nuclear
winds driven by the quasar or, in the case of ULIRGS, by
starbursts, can signiﬁcantly remove gas from galaxy cores,
thus quenching nuclear star formation, leading to radia-
tively ineﬃcient accretion (For a recent review of quasar
feedback, see KP2015.). At the present epoch, central
SMBHs are generally not in a quasar mode, but instead are
radiatively faint, releasing the energy they produce from
accretion kinetically through jets. These AGN outbursts
can reheat cooling gas, thus truncating star formation and
the growth of the SMBH.

AGN feedback is often observed through the cavities
and shocks produced by SMBH outbursts in the hot X-
ray atmospheres of massive early-type galaxies, groups and
clusters. However the mass of NGC 5195, estimated to be
one tenth to half the mass of its companion NGC 5194
(Smith et al. 1990; Howard & Byrd 1990), is in the range
from a few 1010M⊙ ˙m to 1011M⊙ ˙m and is too low to grav-
itationally bind hot X-ray emitting gas. Instead we have
argued that the X-ray and Hα arcs near the nucleus of
NGC 5195 are likely produced by episodic outbursts from
the central SMBH that shock-heat cool gas in the galaxy
core to X-ray emitting temperatures.

For those less familiar with the literature on feedback,
we direct readers to three recent reviews, each with a
slightly diﬀerent view of feedback: from the viewpoint of

clusters and massive galaxies (F12), from luminous AGN
(KP2015), and from outﬂows caused by starbursts in low-
mass galaxies (Erb 2015).

3.1. Estimates of Physical Quantities

The data at present are limited, so many of the estimates
must be order-of-magnitude. There are also a number of
quantities that cross-feed into the estimates. As we want
to avoid creating confusion in the reader’s mind, the over-
all path is as follows: determine the mass of the SMBH,
then LEdd, then an age estimate for the outbursts from the
velocities, followed by a density estimate, which leads to
the mass of the arcs, followed by an estimate of the cooling
time of the arcs.

From the velocity dispersion σ of 124.8 km s−1 for
NGC 5195 (Ho et al. 2009), the MBH − σ relation yields
MBH∼3.8×107M⊙ (M7 = 3.8), assuming σα = σ4.4
(Ferrarese & Merritt 2000, Gebhardt et al. 2000). The
Eddington luminosity for NGC 5195 is

LEdd = 4πGcM/κ≈1.3×1045(MBH/107M⊙)

where κ = electron scattering opacity; with values inserted
for NGC 5195, we have LEdd = 4.9×1045 ergs s−1 com-
pared to the observed 0.5-2 keV luminosity of ∼5×1038
ergs s−1 (§2.4.2). To reiterate, that value means the
NGC 5195 SMBH is in a radiatively ineﬃcient state of
Lobs = f LEdd with f ∼10−7.

A measure of the velocities of the arcs could lead to
their estimated age. Unfortunately, the velocities of the
arcs and their surroundings likely have not been measured.
The velocity measured from the Hoopes et al. (2001) Hα
spectrum, ∼500 − 600 km s−1, was obtained from a long-
slit spectrograph and represents an average over a range
of velocities (§2.5). The velocity of NGC 5195 itself is
∼470 km s−1 (NED). With uncertainties included, these
two values are comparable. Further, if the gas is conﬁned
to the interaction plane, then any measured velocity is a
projection into our line-of-sight. Absent a good measure
of the projection angle, measured velocities have a wide
range.

Can limits on the velocity of the arcs be set or in-
ferred? Hoopes et al. (2001) measured line ratios from op-
tical spectra from which they inferred that the ratios are
consistent with a shock velocity of “several hundred kilo-
meters per second.” Additionally, a lower limit on the arcs’
motion is set by considering the time from the interaction
of NGC 5195 and NGC 5194 based on models: ∼50-100
Myr (Salo & Laurikainen 2000). Given the present posi-
tions of the arcs, this leads to velocities of ∼8 − 15 (inner)
and ∼17 − 35 (outer) km/sec. However, velocities this
low would not generate shock emission consistent with the
Hoopes et al. (2001) values.

If we instead assume that “several hundred” translates
to ≈300 km/sec, then the arcs require ∼2.5×106 (inner)
and ∼5.6×106 (outer) years to reach their current posi-
tions and the episodes are separated by ≈3×106 years.
Adopting the deﬁnition of terminal velocity from King
(2010) (equation 37 in that paper), and assuming this
value is the velocity of the arcs, then with σ200 = 0.624,
the terminal speed is ve∼875σ2/3
200 km s−1≈620 km s−1 (We
note that the ≈300−600 km s−1 range ﬁts within the simu-
lations of Salo & Laurikainen (2000).). This value leads to

5

dynamical ages of ∼1.2×106 (inner) and ∼2.7×106 (outer)
years. The episodes are then separated by ≈1.5×106 years.
Consequently, if we assume the interaction actually oc-
curred ≈50 MYr ago, then the observed feedback took
some time to develop, with the arcs emerging over the
past ≈106−7 years.

One signiﬁcant question then arises: what was
the material doing for ≈40 MYr, the time between
the interaction of NGC 5195 with NGC 5194 and
the outbursts? The answer could be “infalling”:
if we assume material started from rest and was
located ≈1500 pc distant (approximately the cur-
rent separation of the arm of NGC 5194 from the
nucleus of NGC 5195), then ≈65 MYr must elapse
before the gas reaches the nucleus. With an arbi-
trary initial speed of 100 km s−1, that time would
be reduced to ≈15 MYr. Absent additional con-
straints, this estimate may be the best we can do.
We now move to estimating gas densities with the goal
of calculating masses and cooling times for the arcs to com-
pare with the dynamical age estimate. The Hα (Figure 5)
arc provides one route to the matter density. The ﬂux
in the line emission, integrated over a rectangular region
matching the Hα arc, and again adopting a thickness = 100
thick100 pc, leads to a volume V of 1.3 thick100 ×1063 cm3.
Assuming the Lyman H lines are optically thick (‘Case B’
recombination) then L = nΛV and adopting an emissivity
Λ of 2.59×10−13 cm3 s−1 (Osterbrock & Ferland 2005, ta-
ble 2.1), leads to a number density of ∼5/thick100 cm−3 or
a mass estimate of ≈4×106 M⊙. That value is mid-range
for typical interstellar molecular clouds (Murray 2011).

A second estimate of the number density in the X-ray

arcs follows from the X-ray vapec model normalization:

normalization =

10−14

(4π(DA(1 + z))2 Z ne np dV

(Arnaud 1996). Assuming ne = np, z = 0.002, DA = 8
d8 Mpc, and using the volume V as deﬁned in the prior
paragraph, then ne≈0.06(0.09)thick−1
100 cm−3 for the outer
(inner) arc. The mass in each of the X-ray-emitting arcs is
then ≈5.5×104M⊙ (5.7 (outer) and 5.3 (inner)) or about
1% of the Hα arc.

Given the mass disparity, can the X-ray arcs be push-
ing the Hα arc? Assuming the gas in the X-ray and
the Hα arcs may be described by the ideal gas law, then
the pressures for the Hα, outer, and inner X-ray arcs are
3.5×10−12, 1.9×10−11, and 4.3×10−11 dyn cm−2, respec-
tively. The X-ray arcs then have about a factor of 5-12
times higher pressure than the Hα arc, driving material
outwards. The total kinetic energy of the X-ray arcs is
≈2×1053 ergs.

A second check on our mass estimates is possible. If the
outer arc swept clear the gas in the halo along that vector,
then the mass in the second arc is an approximate measure
of the rate of accumulation. We acknowledge that the sec-
ond arc is not moving through precisely the same space,
but the question remains: is it possible to sweep up the ob-
served mass? Above, we estimated the mass in the second
arc as ≈5.3×104 M⊙ and the interval between episodes
as ≈1.3×106 years. Those values lead to an accumulation
rate of ≈4×10−2 M⊙ yr−1. Magorrian et al. (1998) de-
veloped a bulge mass-SMBH mass relation with updates
by McConnell & Ma (2013) and Belﬁori et al. (2012) and

6

environmental dependencies explored by McGee (2013).
The value of σ100 and the SMBH mass yield an estimated
bulge mass / SMBH mass ratio of ≈1000, or a bulge mass
of ≈2 − 4×1010 M⊙
5. If we assume most of that mass is
composed of ≤1M⊙ stars given the color of NGC 5195,
then some of those stars will have evolved oﬀ the main
sequence to at least the asymptotic giant branch (AGB).
AGB stars have typical mass loss rates of ≈10−8 M⊙ yr−1
(De Beck et al. 2010). If just 0.1% are AGB stars, then the
mass available per year is ≈10−1 M⊙, more than suﬃcient
to provide the swept-up mass observed. As a by-product,
we would expect sector-to-sector diﬀerences in gas density
and metals in these regions, a potential test of the overall
interpretation described in this paper.

With densities in hand, we can estimate the cooling time
for comparison with the dynamical time. We use Fig-
ure 1 of Gehrels & Williams (1993) which displays, for an
optically-thin gas with solar abundances, the cooling curve
as a function of temperature for several processes (two-
photon, recombination, bremsstrahlung, and line emis-
sion). For the measured temperatures of the arcs of ∼0.4
and 0.65 keV, line emission dominates the cooling (the
next largest contributor, bremsstrahlung emission, con-
tributes ≤10%). The cooling time is deﬁned as

tcool = (3/2)kT /(neΛ(T ))

where Λ(T ) is the cooling function. With values inserted,
we obtain an estimated cooling time of ≈1−1.6×107 yr for
the X-ray arcs. This estimated cooling time is about an
order-of-magnitude larger than the dynamical time. We
then expect X-ray spectra should be dominated by line
emission, a prediction that could be checked using Hitomi
(Takahashi et al. 2014).

To summarize, we can place a crude limit on the age of
the arcs (∼1 − 3×106 yrs) that is an order-of-magnitude
lower than the cooling time for the arcs based on crude
estimates of their velocities. Estimated densities (≈0.1 − 5
cm−3) lead to the masses of the arcs, which combined with
the arcs’ velocities (adopted as ∼600 km s−1), carry suﬃ-
cient momentum to sweep up the Hα arc. The estimated
densities are supported by an estimate of the normal stel-
lar mass loss within the galaxy’s nuclear volume over the
lifetime of the arcs.

3.2. Additional Future Constraints on Source

Parameters?

3.2.1. Transition Radius from Momentum- to

Energy-driven Flow?

With regard to AGN feedback, we can estimate the ra-
dius of transition from momentum- to energy-driven ﬂow
(KP2015):

Rcrit∼500 M 1/2

8

σ200 pc.

Assuming their approach is valid for NGC 5195, the crit-
ical radius is ≈230 pc or ≈5.8′′ at the adopted distance
of M51. For comparison, the sphere of inﬂuence for the
SMBH is

The X-ray arcs both lie outside of this critical radius and,
within the context of KP2015, both arcs would fall into the
energy-driven regime. Rcrit could easily be constrained
with current-generation telescopes provided the extreme
luminosity contrast of the nucleus vs its surroundings is
overcome.

3.2.2. Another Burst?

Is there evidence of a third episode of feedback? If high-
resolution spectroscopy of the nucleus of NGC 5195 reveals
high-velocity absorption lines, then a third episode would
be underway. We would expect any possible third episode
to be weaker in the sense of lower mass in the outﬂowing
material because the time interval between the cur-
rent burst is less than the time between the two
outbursts.

3.2.3. Star Formation?

Inspecting the Hα image reveals two or three knots
of emission (depending upon one’s deﬁnition of ’knot’),
strongly suggesting the development, perhaps the initial
development, of H II regions surrounding star formation.
Given the pressure and densities involved, the expanding
X-ray arcs should create the conditions for star formation
through the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. If conﬁrmed, this
region in NGC 5195 would be a clear case of triggered
star formation. Veriﬁcation that stars are forming in the
plowed material will require additional optical or infrared
observations centered on the knots. Estimates of the ages
of the star-forming complexes would aid in constraining
the scenario described in this paper. In addition, careful
inspection of the sectors along which the arcs have trav-
elled in comparison to other sectors may provide a measure
of the degree to which cold gas has been removed by the
action of the expanding arcs, thereby establishing at least
one timeline for galaxy evolution.

3.2.4. Azimuthally-limited Arcs?

That each arc is limited azimuthally may suggest an in-
terpretation that the arcs are more similar to a bubble.
That interpretation could also argue for the North-South
diﬀerences: bubbles present on the South side of the nu-
cleus need not also appear on the North side. However, a
bubble implies a slow vertical rise, hence unlikely to lead
a shock or to X-ray emission6

Alternatively, King & Pringle (2006) describe a ‘chaotic
accretion’ scenario in which the orientation of the accre-
tion disk changes after an accretion episode. This scenario
is used to describe SMBH growth at high redshift. Perhaps
NGC 5195 is a local analog of events that took place at
high redshift. The chaotic accretion scenario leads to mo-
mentum feedback that is isotropic over long times. That
suggests that over short times, feedback eﬀects need not
be isotropic. While we do not have any constraints on the
orientation of an accretion disk in NGC 5195, a question
immediately arises from the observed arcs – do their posi-
tions and separations constrain our understanding of the
accretion episodes or the interactions of the galaxies in any

Rinf ∼

∼9pc≈0′′.2.

5 We note that this relation has a two orders-of-magnitude range for any given SMBH mass, but the range is not critical for our purposes: our
intent in using the relation at this time is plausibility, not accuracy.
6 Bubbles do have X-ray-emitting rims because as they rise, they can sweep up hot gas in a galaxy’s halo (Finoguenov et al. 2008). The NGC
5195 halo does not appear to be hot, hence we would not expect to see hot, rimmed bubbles.

fundamental way? At this moment, we do not have an an-
swer, but such a question calls for additional simulations
of the interactions.

3.2.5. Similar Objects?

Are there similar objects to NGC 5195? Locally, there
appear to be very few – one recent object may be NGC
660 (Argo et al. 2015). It is described as an ‘unremarkable
starburst’ with a ‘polar-ring morphology and a LINER-
type nucleus.’
It has an estimated SMBH mass of log
MBH = 7.35M⊙ and an Eddington ratio of 10−6. Both
values are similar to the NGC 5195 values.
Interest-
ingly, Argo et al. (2015) infer that a ﬂare occurred be-
tween 2008 and 2012. We suggest NGC 5195 lies at
an intermediate stage between a ﬂare in the SMBH and
rings and bubbles observed in the outskirts of an AGN
or intercluster medium. That the arcs originate with a
SMBH, are cooling, and appear to be moving at high ve-
locity, raises a possible third scenario7 that some of the
high-velocity clouds observed in the Milky Way’s halo
(Wakker & van Woerden 1997) originate in a similar man-
ner.

How do the NGC 5195 arcs ﬁt into the overall developing
picture of feedback? Several objects studied with Chandra
have been shown to illustrate bubbles and outﬂows: arm-
like shocked outﬂows in the halo of NGC 4636 (Jones et al.
2002); bubbles near the center of M84 (Finoguenov et al.
2008); outﬂows in the E galaxy NGC 4552 (M89) in the
Virgo cluster (Machacek et al. 2006) and in the center of
the NGC 5846 group (Machacek et al. 2011). The diﬀer-
ence between NGC 5195 and these objects is perhaps the
diﬀerence between a relatively steady inﬂux of matter ver-
sus the transient inﬂux to the SMBH in NGC 5195 result-
ing from the interaction with NGC 5194. That comment
suggests that other interacting galaxies should exhibit sim-
ilar reactions provided the interaction has occurred rela-
tively recently.

4. summary

From X-ray and Hα images, we ﬁnd two X-ray arcs on
the south side ∼15′′ − 30′′ from the nucleus of NGC 5195;
Hα arc lies just outside of the outer X-ray arc. The results
for NGC 5195 are important for at least three reasons: (i)
they demonstrate dynamical and active feedback; (ii) they

7

may illustrate an example of triggered star formation; and
(iii) the arcs are a ‘snapshot’ intermediate in the evolution
between winds detected in the X-ray spectra of nuclei of
AGN and the large-scale ﬁlaments and bubbles observed
in the hot atmospheres of many massive galaxies as well
as in groups and clusters.

NGC 5195 is important for another reason: it is an ex-
ample, perhaps the only one detected to date, where at
least four critical clocks are evolving simultaneously: one
clock started with the interaction between NGC 5194 and
NGC 5195; a second started with the star formation trig-
gered by the interaction; a third started with the reaction
of the SMBH to the accreted material from the interaction;
and the last clock commenced with the episodic nature of
the response of the SMBH – given an accretion pulse, how
long before the response? The rates at which the clocks
advance are not well-known, but NGC 5195 presents per-
haps the nearest opportunity to at least constrain some or
all of those rates. Knowledge of such rates may be impor-
tant for studies of the early universe.

Additional observations of NGC 5195 are necessary in-
cluding: (i) a deep Chandra observation north of NGC
5195 will ascertain the outﬂow symmetry to test the ex-
pectation of isotropic outﬂows; (ii) Hα velocities of both
of the arcs and their surroundings, using an integral ﬁeld
spectrometer, will pin down motions of the blast waves and
provide improved estimates of the mass of swept-up mate-
rial; (iii) estimates of the ages of star clusters that appear
to be forming in the swept-up material will further con-
strain the timeline; (iv) observations at wavelengths that
peer through the dust may provide additional insights in-
terior to the arcs, e.g., molecular outﬂows; (v) observations
that look at the dust can determine whether it is optically
thick (as noted in KP2015); (vi) polarization observations
that resolve ﬁeld behavior may illuminate the interaction
of the magnetic ﬁeld with the blast waves; and (vii) VLA
observations using the A conﬁguration, or VLBI, can study
the radio emission in greater detail. Given the dynamic
nature of the arcs, high-resolution observations should be
repeated on a moderate time frame to probe possible time
dependence.

used in the spectral ﬁts was 0.4 - 2.4 keV. Error values represent the 90% contour.

Fig. 1.— (a) Chandra images of NGC 5195 from the merged long observations of M51 (PI K. Kuntz). North is up and east is left for all
frames; the scale bar on the right side of the ﬁgure is 1 arcmin in length. The nuclei of NGC 5194 (A) and NGC 5195 (B) are labeled, as is
an X-ray-emitting spiral arm lying midway between the nuclei (Vega et al. 2016). The image shows events between 0.4 and 8 keV, binned by
a factor of 2, exposure-corrected but without background subtraction.

Fig. 1.— (b) an expanded view of (a) with the two arcs south of the nucleus, as well as the nucleus, indicated. The image is un-binned
but zoomed by a factor of 2. The other dark objects are X-ray point sources either near the nucleus or in the background. The dashed line
indicates the approximate edge of the CCD. The black-and-white inset shows four (red arcs) of the twenty regions used to determine the
radial proﬁle.

Fig. 1.— (c) Comparison of the summed ∼700 ksec Faint mode data (right) with the ∼790 ksec merged Faint + Very Faint mode data
(left). North is up, East is left. Absent the longer exposure, the Very Faint mode data would be diﬃcult to interpret. However, in the context
of the long Faint mode exposures, the faint emission North of the nucleus in this image may suggest symmetric expulsion of matter. The
dashed line in the right image indicates the approximate edge of the CCD.

Fig. 2.— Radial proﬁles of both arcs. The counts were extracted in angular annuli using a region similar to that shown in Figure 1(b) but
using 20 annuli. The radius is the mid-point of an annulus and is deﬁned as the radial distance from the nucleus. The position of the nucleus
is adopted as deﬁned in Table 2. The data were at full resolution, so each pixel is 0′′
.5. The inner arc partially overlaps the outer arc
near position angle ∼180 degrees; the background region for the inner arc is consequently shorter in azimuth than the region for the outer
arc.

North is up and East is left in all frames. The size of each frame is identical and ∼54 arc sec on a side. The contours represent the X-ray
diﬀuse arcs with contours drawn at 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, and 20 counts. The Hα frame is expanded in Figure 5. Note that the outer X-ray arc
overlays a broad arc-like feature in the VLA 6 cm observation.

Fig. 5.— The Hα image of NGC 5195 with contours of X-ray emission (blue) overlaid from Figure 4. The contours are as described in
Figure 4. North is up and East is left. The scale bar on the right side is 1 arc minute in length. The short bars approximately in the middle
of the upper and left sides of the box point toward the nucleus of NGC 5195, indicated by a small, red cross. The line of Hα lumps directly
east of NGC 5195 are H II regions on the end of the arm of NGC 5194, the nucleus of which lies nearly due south of NGC 5195.
