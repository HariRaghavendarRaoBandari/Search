Blow-ups in generalized K¨ahler geometry

Abstract

We continue the study of blow-ups in generalized complex geometry with the blow-up theory
for generalized K¨ahler manifolds. The natural candidates for submanifolds to be blown-up
are those which are generalized Poisson for one of the two generalized complex structures and
can be blown up in a generalized complex manner. We show that the bi-Hermitian structure
underlying the generalized K¨ahler pair lifts to a degenerate bi-Hermitian structure on this
blow-up. Then, using a deformation procedure based on potentials in K¨ahler geometry, we
identify two concrete situations in which one can deform the degenerate structure on the
blow-up into a non-degenerate one. We end with an investigation of generalized K¨ahler Lie
groups and give a concrete example on (S1)n × (S3)m, for n + m even.

Introduction

Generalized K¨ahler geometry was born in 1984 when Gates, Hull and Roˆcek [10] discovered
new supersymmetric sigma-models in physics, whose background geometry could be relaxed
from K¨ahler to generalized K¨ahler. At that time it appeared in the guise of bi-Hermitian
geometry; pairs of complex structures (I+, I−) compatible with a common metric g, satis-
fying an additional integrability equation. Bi-Hermitian geometry then gained interest from
mathematicians and some theory was developed, notably in dimension four. For instance,
a classiﬁcation of four–manifolds carrying two compatible complex structures (I+, I−) with
I+ (cid:54)= ±I− has been obtained in the cases where the metric is anti-self-dual (Pontecorvo [19])
and where the ﬁrst Betti number is even (Apostolov, Gauduchon and Grantcharov [1]).

Around 2003 generalized K¨ahler geometry appeared in a diﬀerent formulation out of the
work of Gualtieri [14], in the context of generalized complex geometry. Generalized geometry
is centered on the idea of replacing the tangent bundle of a manifold by the sum of its tangent
and cotangent bundle. This creates enough room for merging both complex and symplectic

structures into one object called a generalized complex structure. Just as a K¨ahler manifold
consists out of a complex and a symplectic structure which are compatible, a generalized
K¨ahler manifold is deﬁned by a compatible pair of generalized complex structures. Gualtieri
showed that generalized K¨ahler geometry is equivalent to bi-Hermitian geometry, providing
an interesting new point of view on the latter and resulting in new advances in the theory.
For instance, a reduction theory became available for generalized K¨ahler structures, with ap-
plications to moduli spaces of instantons (Hitchin [15]; Burzstyn, Cavalcanti, Gualtieri [5],
[6]). Another example is the deformation theorem of Goto [11], which states that on a com-
pact manifold, a deformation of one of the two structures in a generalized K¨ahler pair can be
coupled to a deformation of the second, provided the second is of a special type (“generalized
Calabi-Yau”). This theorem can be applied to compact K¨ahler manifolds with a holomorphic
Poisson structure, giving an important class of examples.

Despite all these developments the study of generalized K¨ahler manifolds remains diﬃcult,
and examples where the underlying manifold does not support a K¨ahler structure are scarce.
Noteworthy examples of the latter include even dimensional compact Lie groups (Gualtieri
[13]) and some speciﬁc solvmanifolds (Fino, Tomassini [9]).

In this paper we will be concerned with the blow-up theory of generalized K¨ahler mani-
folds. Blow-ups in generalized complex geometry were studied in [7] and [3], leading to the
following conclusions. There are two types of generalized complex submanifolds that are suit-
able for blowing up; generalized Poisson submanifolds and generalized Poisson transversals.
The former look complex in transverse directions and, under an additional hypothesis on the
Lie algebra induced on the conormal bundle, such submanifolds admit a (canonical) blow-up.
Generalized Poisson transversals are symplectic in transverse directions and admit a global
normal form, which implies the existence of a (non-canonical) blow-up.
In a generalized
K¨ahler manifold a generalized Poisson submanifold for one of the structures is automati-
cally a generalized Poisson transversal for the other, just as a complex manifold of a K¨ahler
manifold is automatically symplectic. The main question of this paper is then whether such
submanifolds admit a generalized K¨ahler blow-up. The case of a point in a four–dimensional
manifold has been investigated in [8], and we will adapt the techniques employed there to
higher dimensional submanifolds. We obtain two situations where a blow-up exists. The ﬁrst
is when the Lie algebra structure on the conormal bundle is Abelian, which geometrically
means that the exceptional divisor of the blow-up is again generalized Poisson. The second
situation is when the submanifold in question is contained in a Poisson divisor for one of the
two complex structures in the bi-Hermitian picture. This will be the case for instance when
the structure for which Y is generalized Poisson is generically symplectic. We end the paper
with an explicit investigation of generalized K¨ahler structures on even dimensional compact
Lie groups. We show that a maximal torus, which can be taken generalized Poisson for a
suitably chosen generalized K¨ahler structure, can be blown up in a generalized complex way
if and only if the Lie group equals (S1)n × (S3)m, with n + m even. There is then no further
constraint to blow-up the generalized K¨ahler structure.

Organization: The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we lay out the basic ingredients
from generalized complex and generalized K¨ahler geometry. For a more detailed explanation
including proofs we refer to [14] and [13]. In Section 3 we discuss a deformation procedure
for bi-Hermitian structures for which the metric is possibly degenerate. This part is based on
[16] and [8]. Then, in Section 4 we show that the bi-Hermitian structure lifts to a degenerate
structure on the blow-up and, under additional hypotheses, apply the deformation procedure
from Section 3 to obtain a generalized K¨ahler blow-up. Finally, in Section 5 we investigate
submanifolds of generalized K¨ahler Lie groups that are suitable for blowing up.

2 Generalized geometry

2.1 Generalized complex geometry

Let M be a real 2n-dimensional manifold and H a closed real 3–form. In generalized geometry
the tangent bundle is replaced by TM := T M ⊕ T ∗M . It is endowed with a natural pairing

(cid:104)X + ξ, Y + η(cid:105) :=

1
2

(ξ(Y ) + η(X))

and a bracket on its space of sections called the Courant bracket:

(cid:74)X + ξ, Y + η(cid:75) := [X, Y ] + LX (η) − ιY dξ − ιY ιX H.

It satisﬁes the Jacobi identity but is not skew-symmetric.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A generalized complex structure on (M, H) is a complex structure J on TM
which is orthogonal with respect to (cid:104),(cid:105) and whose (+i)–eigenbundle L ⊂ TMC is involutive1.
A Lagrangian, involutive subbundle L ⊂ TMC is also called a Dirac structure, and generalized
complex structures correspond in a one-to-one fashion with Dirac structures L satisfying the
additional non-degeneracy condition L ∩ L = 0.
Example 2.2. The main examples come from complex and symplectic geometry:

are generalized complex structures, with associated Dirac structures LI = T 0,1 ⊕ (T ∗)1,0 and
Lω = (1 − iω)T . Another important example is provided by a holomorphic Poisson structure
(I, σ). If Q is the real part of σ, then

(cid:18)−I

4IQ
I∗

J(I,σ) =

(2.2)

is generalized complex and L(I,σ) = T 0,1 ⊕ (1 + σ)(T ∗)1,0. In these examples H = 0.
Dirac structures can conveniently be described in terms of diﬀerential forms. There is a
natural action of the Cliﬀord algebra of (TM,(cid:104),(cid:105)) on forms given by

(X + ξ) · ρ = ιX ρ + ξ ∧ ρ,

giving an identiﬁcation between the space of diﬀerential forms and the space of spinors for
Cl(TM,(cid:104),(cid:105)). A line subbundle K ⊂ Λ•T ∗MC gives rise to an isotropic subbundle L ⊂ TMC
by taking the annihilator

L = {X + ξ ∈ TMC|(X + ξ) · K = 0}.

This yields to a one-to-one correspondence between Dirac structures L ⊂ TMC, and complex
line bundles K ⊂ Λ•T ∗MC which satisfy the following two conditions. Firstly, K has to be
generated by pure spinors, i.e. forms ρ which at each point x admit a decomposition

ρx = eB+iω ∧ Ω

(2.3)

where B + iω is a 2–form and Ω is decomposable. This condition is equivalent to L being of
maximal rank. Secondly, if ρ is a local section of K there should exist X + ξ ∈ Γ(TMC) with

dH ρ = (X + ξ) · ρ.

This condition amounts to the involutivity of L. The condition L ∩ ¯L = 0 can then be
expressed in spinor language using the Chevalley pairing: If ρ ∈ Γ(K) is non-vanishing then

L ∩ ¯L = 0 ⇐⇒ (ρ, ¯ρ)Ch := (ρ ∧ ¯ρT )top (cid:54)= 0.

1A subbundle of TM is called involutive if its space of sections is closed with respect to the Courant bracket.

3

Here the superscript T stands for transposition, acting on a degree l–form by (β1 . . . βl)T =
βl . . . β1, and the subscript top stands for the highest degree component. If ρ is given by (2.3)
at a particular point x then this condition becomes

ωn−k ∧ Ω ∧ ¯Ω (cid:54)= 0,

(2.4)

where k := deg(Ω). The line bundle K associated to a generalized complex structure is
called the canonical line bundle, and the integer k appearing in (2.4) is called the type at x.
Structures of type 0 and n are called symplectic, respectively complex2. Another description
of the type is as follows. Every generalized complex structure naturally induces a Poisson
structure given by the composition

πJ : T

∗

M (cid:44)→ TM

J−→ TM (cid:16) T M.

(2.5)

The conormal bundle to the leaves, i.e. the kernel of πJ , is given by the complex distribution

νJ := T

∗

M ∩ J T

∗

M.

In general νJ might be singular, for its complex dimension may jump in even steps from one
point to the next.
Intuitively, one can think of generalized complex structures as Poisson
structures with transverse complex structures, and the type at a point x equals the number
of complex directions, i.e.

typex(J ) = dimC(νJ )x =

1
2

corankR(πJ )x.

Since generalized geometry mixes covariant and contravariant tensors the notion of morphism
requires some care.

Deﬁnition 2.3. A generalized map between (M1, H1) and (M2, H2) is a pair Φ := (ϕ, B),
where ϕ : M1 → M2 is a smooth map and B ∈ Ω2(M1) satisﬁes ϕ∗H2 = H1 + dB.
We will often abbreviate (ϕ, 0) by ϕ and drop the preﬁx “generalized”. An important role is
played by B-ﬁeld transformations, maps of the form3 (Id,−B) =: eB∗ . They act on TM via

eB∗ : X + ξ (cid:55)→ X + ξ − ιX B.

(2.6)
Given u ∈ Γ(TM ) we denote by ad(u) : Γ(TM ) → Γ(TM ) the adjoint action with respect to
the Courant bracket. This inﬁnitesimal symmetry has a ﬂow, i.e. a family of isomorphisms

ψt : TM → TM with d/dt(ψt(v)) = −(cid:74)u, ψt(v)(cid:75). If u = X + ξ and ϕt is the ﬂow of X then
where Bt :=(cid:82) t

r(dξ + ιX H)dr. A map Φ = (ϕ, B) gives rise to a correspondence: we say

that X + ξ is Φ-related to Y + η, and write X + ξ ∼Φ Y + η, if

0 ϕ∗

ψt = (ϕt)∗ ◦ e

−Bt∗

.

ϕ∗X = Y, ξ = ϕ

η − ιX B.

Deﬁnition 2.4. A map Φ : (M1, H1,J1) → (M2, H2,J2) is called generalized holomorphic if
for every X +ξ ∈ TM1 and Y +η ∈ TM2 with X +ξ ∼Φ Y +η, we have J1(X +ξ) ∼Φ J2(Y +η).
If Φ is in addition invertible we call it an isomorphism.
Remark 2.5. It follows immediately from the deﬁnition that ϕ is a Poisson map, i.e. ϕ∗πJ1 =
πJ2 . This is quite restrictive, for example if the target is symplectic then ϕ has to be a
submersion. In the complex category we recover the usual notion of holomorphic maps.
In case ϕ is a diﬀeomorphism a more concrete description in terms of spinors can be given.
If Ki is the canonical bundle for Ji, Φ being an isomorphism amounts to

K1 = eB ∧ ϕ

K2.

We can now state the analogue of the Newlander-Nirenberg and Darboux Theorems in gen-
eralized complex geometry.

Theorem 2.6 ([2]). Let (M, H,J ) be a generalized complex manifold. If x ∈ M is a point
where J has type k, then a neighborhood of x is isomorphic to a neighborhood of (0, 0) in

(R2n−2k, ωst) × (Ck, σ) := (R2n−2k × Ck,Jωst × J(i,σ))

(2.8)

where ωst is the standard symplectic form, σ is a holomorphic Poisson structure which vanishes
at 0, and Jωst and J(i,σ) are deﬁned in Example 2.2.
To blow up submanifolds we need an appropriate notion of generalized complex submanifold.
The deﬁnition that we will use generalizes complex and symplectic submanifolds, as those are
the submanifolds that are known to admit a blow up in their respective categories (there is
for instance no blow-up available for (co-)isotropic submanifolds of a symplectic manifold).
Let Φ = (ϕ, B) be a map and L2 a Dirac structure on (M2, H2). We deﬁne the backward
image of L2 along Φ by

BΦ(L2) := {X + ϕ
∗

ξ − ιX B| ϕ∗X + ξ ∈ L2}.

(2.9)

This is a Dirac structure on (M1, H1), provided it is a smooth vector bundle. A suﬃcient
condition for this is that ker(dϕ∗) ∩ ϕ∗L is of constant rank. More information can be found
in [4].
Deﬁnition 2.7. A generalized complex submanifold is a submanifold i : Y (cid:44)→ (M, H,J )
such that Bi(L) is generalized complex, i.e. is smooth and Bi(L) ∩ Bi(L) = 0.
Remark 2.8. A suﬃcient condition for smoothness is that N∗Y ∩ J N∗Y is of constant rank.
Moreover, the second condition is equivalent to J N∗Y ∩(N∗Y )⊥ ⊂ N∗Y . In complex or sym-
plectic manifolds we recover the usual notion of complex respectively symplectic submanifolds.
Also, a point is always a generalized complex submanifold. Note that if M is symplectic, i is
generalized holomorphic if and only if Y is an open subset.

2.2 Generalized K¨ahler geometry

Generalized complex structures were introduced with the purpose of unifying complex and
symplectic structures into one framework. On a K¨ahler manifold we have both a complex and
a symplectic structure which are compatible with each other. Here is the generalized version.

Deﬁnition 2.9. A generalized K¨ahler structure on M is a pair of commuting generalized
complex structures (J1,J2), such that G := −J1J2 deﬁnes a generalized metric, i.e.

(u, v) (cid:55)→ (cid:104)Gu, v(cid:105) = (cid:104)J1u,J2v(cid:105)

is a positive deﬁnite metric on TM .
Example 2.10. A natural example is given by an ordinary K¨ahler manifold (M, I, ω). Deﬁne
J1 := JI and J2 := −Jω, which commute because I is compatible with ω, and

(cid:18)0

g

G =

(cid:19)

g−1
0

is indeed positive, where g := −ωI is the associated K¨ahler metric.
Since G2 = 1, TM decomposes into its (±1)–eigenspaces V+ and V−, on which the pairing
restricts to a positive, respectively negative deﬁnite form. So choosing a generalized metric
amounts to choosing a reduction of structure groups for TM from O(2n, 2n) to O(2n)×O(2n).
The restriction of J1 induces a complex structure on V±, leading to decompositions

As J2 equals ±J1 on V±, we obtain

(V±)C = V 1,0± ⊕ V 0,1± .

L1 = V 1,0

+ ⊕ V 1,0− ,

L2 = V 1,0

+ ⊕ V 0,1− .

(2.10)
Because V± does not intersect the isotropics T M and T ∗M , the projection V± → T M is an
isomorphism and we can write V± as the graph of a map a± : T M → T ∗M . If we decompose
a+ = g+b where g is symmetric and b is skew, then positivity of (cid:104),(cid:105)|V+ implies that g is positive
deﬁnite, while orthogonality of V+ and V− implies a− = −g + b. Transporting the complex

5

structure given by J1 on V± to T M we obtain two almost complex structures I± on M , both
compatible with g. Such a tuple (g, b, I+, I−) will be called an almost4 bi-Hermitian structure.
The above construction can then be reversed, giving a bijection between almost bi-Hermitian
structures (g, b, I+, I−) and almost generalized K¨ahler structures (J1,J2). Integrability can
be expressed as follows.
Proposition 2.11 ([12, Theorem 6.28]). Let (J1,J2) be an almost generalized K¨ahler struc-
ture and (g, b, I+, I−) the associated almost bi-Hermitian structure. Then the following are
equivalent:

i) (J1,J2) is generalized K¨ahler.
ii) I± are both integrable and ±dc±ω± = H − db, where ω± = gI± and dc± = i( ¯∂± − ∂±).
iii) I± are both integrable and ∇±I± = 0, where ∇± := ∇ ∓ 1

2 g−1(H − db) and ∇ is the

Levi-Cevita connection associated to g.

An explicit relation between (J1,J2) and (g, b, I±) is given by

It follows that πJ1 + πJ2 is invertible and, using a little bit of linear algebra, this implies that

type(J1) + type(J2) ≤ n.

One can also relate the parity of the types of J1 and J2 to the orientations of I±. In general,
on a 2n–dimensional manifold, type(J1) = n mod 2 if and only if I+ and I− induce the same
orientation, while type(J2) = n mod 2 if and only if I+ and −I− induce the same orientations.
Remark 2.12.

1 If (J1,J2) is generalized K¨ahler then so is (J2,J1), with the same generalized metric G.
So when considering e.g. a generalized Poisson submanifold (c.f. Section 4.1) for one of
the two structures, we may as well assume this to be J1.

2 We can always gauge away the two-form b by a transformation of the form (2.6), at the
expense of modifying H by H − db. In what follows we will often implicitly assume this
has been done, and we will refer to the tuple (g, I±, H) as the bi-Hermitian structure.
The diﬃcult feature of bi-Hermitian geometry lies in the fact that I+ and I− do not commute
in general. Therefore, standard techniques in complex geometry, such as decomposition of
forms into types, become diﬃcult as they can be performed only for one of the two complex
structures at a time. This failure of commutativity suggests that important information about
the generalized K¨ahler structure is contained in the tensor

Q := − 1

[I+, I−]g

−1 : T

M → T M.

(2.13)

Since Q is skew-symmetric we can regard it as a bivector, and it was observed in [1] in the
4–dimensional case and in [15] in the general case, that Q is Poisson. In fact, it turns out to
be the real part of two holomorphic Poisson structures
σ± := Q − iI±Q.

(2.14)

One can prove this directly in local coordinates using the integrability conditions (see [15]),
or in the following more abstract way (see [13]). If L1 is a Dirac structure on (M, H1) and L2
a Dirac structure on (M, H2), we can form their Baer-sum on (M, H1 + H2) via
L1 (cid:2) L2 := Bi(L1 × L2) = {X + ξ + η|X + ξ ∈ L1, X + η ∈ L2},

4The adjective “almost” refers to a structure without assuming any integrability conditions. The appropriate

integrability conditions in this case are given by Proposition 2.11 ii).

6

where i = (i, 0) : (M, H1 + H2) → (M, H1) × (M, H2) denotes the diagonal map, and the
backward image is deﬁned in (2.9). A suﬃcient condition for L1 (cid:2) L2 to be smooth is that
L1 ∩ L2 ∩ T ∗M is of constant rank. Note that there is a natural map L1 ×T M L2 → L1 (cid:2) L2
given by (X +ξ, X +η) (cid:55)→ X +ξ +η, which is an isomorphism if and only if L1∩L2∩T ∗M = 0.
The latter condition also ensures that for spinors ρ1, ρ2 for L1, L2, the product ρ1 ∧ ρ2 does
not vanish and forms a spinor for L1 (cid:2) L2.
Observe that T M , considered as Dirac structure on (M, 0), acts as a two-sided identity
with respect to the Baer-sum operation, i.e. L (cid:2) T M = L = T M (cid:2) L. There is also an inverse
for each Dirac structure L on (M, H), given by LT := {X + ξ|X − ξ ∈ L} on (M,−H), which
satisﬁes L (cid:2) LT = LT (cid:2) L = T M . If L comes from a generalized complex structure, a quick
computation shows that

L (cid:2) ¯LT = {− i

πJ ).

This is one way to see that πJ is integrable. In a similar spirit we have the following propo-
sition which follows from the results in [13], and we give a proof for completeness.
Proposition 2.13. Let (J1,J2) be a generalized K¨ahler structure with associated Dirac struc-
tures L1, L2, and let (g, I±, H) be the corresponding bi-Hermitian structure. Then

Then (2.15) and (2.16) are decompositions of σ+(ξ) in T 0,1
respectively. Writing ζ := 4(ξ − P+ ¯P−ξ + P−ξ) and η := −4P+ ¯P−ξ − 4 ¯P−ξ we have

Lemma 2.14. ker([I+, I−]) = ker(I+ + I−) ⊕ ker(I+ − I−).

7

Proof. Clearly ker(I+ + I−) ∩ ker(I+ − I−) = 0, and using

[I+, I−] = (I+ − I−)(I+ + I−) = −(I+ + I−)(I+ − I−)

we see that ker([I+, I−]) ⊃ ker(I+ + I−) ⊕ ker(I+ − I−). As both I± anti-commute with
[I+, I−], they preserve ker([I+, I−]). On this subspace I+ and I− commute with each other
and so they admit a simultaneous eigenspace decomposition, all of whose eigenvalues are ±i.
The result follows.
In particular, we have ker(Q) = ker(πJ1 ) ⊕ ker(πJ2 )

3 A ﬂow of bi-Hermitian structures

In the process of blowing up generalized K¨ahler manifolds one encounters metrics which degen-
erate along the exceptional divisor. To deal with this we introduce a deformation procedure
to ﬂow a degenerate structure into a non-degenerate one. The idea behind this ﬂow already
appears in [16] where it was used to describe new examples of generalized K¨ahler manifolds,
and it was subsequently used in [8] for the blow-up procedure. The following deﬁnition is
intended to capture the situation encountered in the blow-up.
Deﬁnition 3.1. A degenerate bi-Hermitian structure on M is a tuple (g, I+, I−, H), where g
is a symmetric bilinear form, I± are complex structures and H is a closed 3–form, such that
i) g is positive on M\E, where E ⊂ M is a closed and nowhere dense submanifold, on

which T M⊥ has constant rank.

ii) I± are compatible with g and satisfy the integrability condition ±dc±ω± = H.
2 [I+, I−]g−1, deﬁned on M\E, extends smoothly over M .
iii) The bivector Q := − 1
Since the structure is bi-Hermitian on a dense set, it follows that Qg = − 1
2 [I+, I−] holds
everywhere and that σ± := Q − iI±Q is holomorphic Poisson with respect to I±. To deﬁne
the ﬂow, we need the following extra ingredient.
Deﬁnition 3.2. A potential for I+ (respectively I−) is a closed 1–form α deﬁned on an open
dense set, such that Xα := Q(α) and dc
Remark 3.3. The terminology originates from the situation where α = −df for a densely
deﬁned function f , which is usually referred to as the potential. Although this is the situation
in which we are interested, we state the results in this section for general closed 1–forms.
Let α be a potential for I+. Denote by ϕt the ﬂow of Xα and deﬁne closed 2-forms

forms a bi-Hermitian structure for suﬃciently small t > 0.

Proof. It is clear that gt is symmetric, I±,t are integrable and that Ht is closed for all t. By
construction gt is compatible with I−,t = I−. Let us show that gt is a metric for suﬃciently
+α) ⊂ V
small t > 0. Choose a relatively compact open neighborhood V of E in M with supp(dc
and pick a δ1 > 0 and a relatively compact open set W with ϕt(V ) ⊂ W for all t ≤ δ1. By
t = 0 on M\W for t ≤ δ1 and so gt = g is non-degenerate there. Writing
construction F +
gt = g + ht, then as t goes to 0, ht/t converges to ˙h0 which by assumption is positive on
T M⊥. For small  > 0, g +  ˙h0 is positive on T M|E and therefore also on T M|U for U ⊂ W
a small enough neighborhood of E. Hence the same is true for g + ht/t, and therefore also

8

for tg/ + ht, provided t > 0 is close to zero. If in addition t ≤  then tg/ + ht ≤ g + ht = gt
since g ≥ 0. In conclusion, there exist a neighborhood U of E in W and a δ2 > 0 such that
gt is positive on U for all 0 < t ≤ δ2. Since W\U is compact and g0 = g is non-degenerate on
M\E there is a δ3 > 0 such that gt is positive on W\U for 0 ≤ t ≤ δ3. Consequently, gt is a
metric for 0 < t ≤ min(δ1, δ2, δ3).
As already observed above, gt is compatible with I−,t for all t. Moreover, since any closed
2–form F on a complex manifold satisﬁes

dcF 1,1 = id(F 2,0 − F 0,2),

we obtain

Hence all that is left to verify is that I+,t is also compatible with gt and that dc
+,tω+,t = Ht.
In contrast with the I−,t case this is not immediately obvious, the reason being that the ﬂow
seems to treat I+ and I− on an unequal footing. However, we will now show that if we pull
back (3.1) by ϕt, we obtain a similar ﬂow but with the roles of I+ and I− interchanged. We
begin by giving an alternative formula for I+,t.

careful since we do not know whether F
is smooth. We can apply the above argument on
the open dense set where α is smooth, if we keep the time parameter small. In particular, we
conclude that LXα I− = Qdc−α holds on the dense set where α is deﬁned. Since Xα is smooth,

we learn that Qdc−α, and therefore also QG
t , are smooth. The statement for I−
then follows because it holds at t = 0, and because both sides have equal time derivatives.

deﬁned in Proposition 2.11, which are deﬁned on the open set M\E where g is a metric.

Proof. We will verify these expressions on the intersection of M\E with the open dense set
where α is deﬁned. Since the left-hand sides of both equations are smooth, this shows that
the right-hand sides have smooth extensions over all of M .
As both sides of (3.2) are symmetric, it suﬃces to evaluate them on a pair (Y, Y ). Using

for potentials for I−. In that case we need I∗
Remark 3.9 ([16]). Theorem 3.4 is stated for metrics which are almost everywhere non-
degenerate. It can however, also be applied to the following situation where g is identically
zero. Suppose (M, I) is a compact complex manifold and σ a holomorphic Poisson structure
with real part Q. Setting g = 0, I± = I and H = 0, this is a degenerate bi-Hermitian structure
in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.1, except for the fact that the degeneracy set E = M is no longer
nowhere dense. Still, Lemma 3.5 only used that Q is the real part of holomorphic Poisson
structures σ± while Lemma 3.6 is trivially true in this case (both sides of both equations are
zero). Hence Theorem 3.4 still applies in this case, and all we need is a potential α such that
−dcα is positive on M . To that end, suppose that D ⊂ M is a divisor which is Poisson for σ
and which in addition is positive, i.e. the line bundle OX (D) is positive. Let s ∈ Γ(OX (D))
be a holomorphic section which vanishes to ﬁrst order along D and choose a Hermitian metric
h on OX (D) such that iRh is positive, where Rh is the curvature of the unitary connection
induced by h. Then α := −d log |s| is a potential with the desired properties, for −dcα = iRh
is smooth and positive, while Q(α) is smooth because D is Poisson (c.f. the proof of Theorem
4.5(i)). The deformation procedure then gives us a bi-Hermitian structure where I+ and I−
are no longer equal. In [16] this was applied to ﬁnd examples of generalized K¨ahler structures
on Del Pezzo surfaces, which are complex surfaces whose anticanonical bundle is positive.

4 Blowing up submanifolds

4.1 Blow-ups in generalized complex geometry

We brieﬂy summarize the results on blowing up submanifolds in generalized complex geometry
as treated in [3]. The most general notion of blowing up a submanifold Y ⊂ M involves the
notion of holomorphic ideal; an ideal IY ⊂ C∞(M ) of complex valued smooth functions with
Y as its zero set, and which is locally around a point in Y generated by functions z1, . . . , zl
that form a submersion to Cl. The blow-up π : ˜M → M of Y in M is then deﬁned by the
following universal property: for any map f : X → M for which f∗IY is a divisor8 there is a
unique factorization of f through π. It is shown in [3] that for every holomorphic ideal there
exists a (canonical) blow-up.
There are two kinds of generalized complex submanifolds9 that admit a blow-up. Firstly,
we have the generalized Poisson submanifolds, by deﬁnition these are the submanifolds Y ⊂
M with J N∗Y = N∗Y , and they behave in a complex manner in normal directions.
It
turns out that these submanifolds inherit a canonical holomorphic ideal from the generalized
complex structure, and so there is a canonical (diﬀerentiable) blow-up. This is however not

8By deﬁnition this is an ideal with nowhere dense zero set and which locally is generated by a single function.
9See Deﬁnition 2.7 for the notion of generalized complex submanifold. Also, by convention all our submanifolds

are closed in M .

11

automatically generalized complex. To phrase the precise condition, observe that a generalized
Poisson submanifold is in particular Poisson for πJ , and so N∗Y inherits a ﬁberwise Lie
algebra structure. Concretely, if α, β ∈ N∗

y Y and X ∈ TyM , we have

[α, β](X) = (L(cid:101)X πJ )(α, β),

where (cid:101)X is an arbitrary local extension of X. This Lie bracket turns out to be complex

linear, where the complex structure on N∗Y is given by the restriction of J . We call N∗Y
degenerate if the bundle map

∗

Y → Sym2(N

Λ3N

Y )

∗

vanishes. Here both the exterior and symmetric algebra are taken over C, which is well-deﬁned
since N∗Y is complex. Note that degeneracy is really a property of Lie algebras, and N∗Y
being degenerate means that all its ﬁbers are. Another description of degeneracy for a Lie
algebra is that the bracket of any two elements lies in the plane spanned by them. Then,
the diﬀerentiable blow-up of Y in M admits a generalized complex structure for which the
blow-down map is holomorphic if and only if N∗Y is degenerate.

The second class of submanifolds is formed by the generalized Poisson transversals, deﬁned
by the condition J N∗Y ∩ (N∗Y )⊥ = 0. They behave symplectically in normal directions
and admit a global neighborhood theorem. If in addition Y is compact, using the neighbor-
hood theorem one can construct a (non-canonical) generalized complex blow-up. To put this
blow-up in the context of holomorphic ideals, observe that a submanifold Y equipped with
a complex structure on its normal bundle inherits many holomorphic ideals by taking the
canonical ideal of ﬁberwise linear functions on the manifold N Y , and transporting it into M
using a tubular neighborhood. Then the blow-up of a generalized Poisson transversal can be
regarded as the blow-up with respect to such an ideal. Since it is non-canonical, the ideal
description is not really useful in this context.
On a generalized K¨ahler manifold the two types of submanifolds are related as follows.
Lemma 4.1. Let (M,J1,J2) be a generalized K¨ahler manifold. A submanifold Y ⊂ M
which is generalized Poisson for J1 is a generalized Poisson transversal for J2.

Proof. By the generalized K¨ahler condition we have

(cid:104)J1α,J2α(cid:105) > 0 ∀α ∈ N

∗

Y.
So if J1N∗Y = N∗Y , then obviously J2N∗Y ∩ (N∗Y )⊥ = 0.
In particular, if Y is a generalized Poisson submanifold for J1 such that N∗Y is degenerate,
then Y can be blown up for both J1 and J2, albeit in diﬀerent manners. It sounds reasonable
to expect that there will be a generalized K¨ahler blow-up for Y in M . Although a complete
answer is still lacking, in the next sections we will give some extra suﬃcient conditions that
will guarantee the existence of a generalized K¨ahler blow-up.
The strategy will be the following: Given a Y ⊂ (M,J1,J2) as above, we blow it up for J1
and then show that the bi-Hermitian structure lifts to a degenerate bi-Hermitian structure on
the blow-up. Then, under additional hypotheses we apply the ﬂow procedure of the previous
section which makes the structure non-degenerate, and the result will be the desired blow-up.

4.2 Lifting the bi-Hermitian structure
Let Y ⊂ (M,J1,J2) be a generalized Poisson transversal for J1. Associated to (J1,J2) there
is the pair of holomorphic Poisson structures (I±, σ±) deﬁned in (2.14), whose real parts
equal Q. We want to show that (I±, σ±) all lift to the generalized complex blow-up of Y with
respect to J1. To that end we will ﬁrst prove that σ± lifts to the blow-up of Y with respect
to I±, and then show that the three diﬀerent blow-ups coincide.
±N∗Y = N∗Y
−|N∗Y . Consequently, Y is a complex Poisson submanifold for both (I±, σ±).
and I∗
Lemma 4.2. N∗Y is degenerate for πJ1 if and only if it is degenerate for Q.

From (2.11) it follows that Y is generalized Poisson for J1 if and only if I∗

y Y , where ˜α, ˜β are smooth local extensions of α and β. Abstractly, if (g, [, ]) is a
Lie algebra and A : g → g a linear map such that [u, v]A := [Au, v] is again a Lie bracket10,
then degeneracy of [, ] implies that for [, ]A as well. To prove this, we need to show that
[x, y]A ∈ C · x + C · y for all x, y ∈ g.
It suﬃces to verify this for x, y that are linearly
independent. Since [, ] is degenerate, there are λ, µ ∈ C with [x, y]A = [Ax, y] = λAx + µy.
Since [, ]A is skew, we have [Ax, y] = [Ax, x + y], and so there are λ(cid:48), µ(cid:48) ∈ C with [x, y]A =
λ(cid:48)Ax + µ(cid:48)(x + y). Comparing both equations, we see that either Ax ∈ C · x + C · y and hence
also [Ax, y] ∈ C · x + C · y, or [Ax, y] = λAx. Running the same argument with x and y
interchanged we see that either [Ax, y] ∈ C · x + C · y, or [Ax, y] = µAy for some µ ∈ C. If
[Ax, y] is nonzero, Ax is proportional to Ay and so [Ax, y] = 0 by skew symmetry of [, ]A, a
contradiction. Hence, [x, y]A ∈ C · x + C · y ∀x, y ∈ g, and so [, ]A is degenerate.

By a result of Polishchuk [18] it follows that Y can be blown up for both (I±, σ±). Let us
denote by ˜M the blow-up with respect to J1 and by ˜M± the blow-up with respect to I±.
Lemma 4.3. The blow-ups ˜M , ˜M+ and ˜M− all coincide.

Proof. As discussed in Section 4.1 and more precisely explained in [3], the blow-up ˜M is
constructed from a holomorphic ideal IY,J1 that Y inherits from J1, while the blow-ups ˜M±
use the natural holomorphic ideals IY,I± that Y inherits from being a complex submanifold
of (M, I±). It thus suﬃces to show that these three ideals coincide, which turns out to be
true up to a conjugation, i.e. IY,J1 = IY,I± . This is not a problem, for the blow-up of a
conjugate ideal is given by the same manifold but with conjugate divisor. Pick a local chart
(R2n−2k, ωst) × (Ck, σ) for J1 as provided by Theorem 2.6, in which Y necessarily looks like
W×Z where W ⊂ R2n−2k is open and Z ⊂ Ck is holomorphic Poisson. If (x, z) are coordinates
on this chart in which Y = {z1, . . . , zl = 0}, it is shown in [3] that the ideal (cid:104)z1, . . . , zl(cid:105) is
independent of the choice of local chart, so they glue together to form (by deﬁnition) the ideal
IY,J1 . Let us verify that IY,J1 = IY,I+ , the case of I− being similar. Pick a holomorphic chart
for I+ with coordinates ui so that Y is given by {u1, . . . , ul = 0} and so IY,I+ = (cid:104)u1, . . . , ul(cid:105).
As is proven for instance in [17], we can verify IY,J1 ⊂ IY,I+ merely by looking at Taylor
series, i.e. we need to show that

where ef is some rescaling. One can prove (4.3) by induction on m and by applying appropriate
Lie derivatives to (4.4). For precise details on this part of the argument we refer to the proof
of Proposition 2.6 in [3], which is almost identical. Hence IY,J1 ⊂ IY,I+ , and since both are
holomorphic ideals for Y , we obtain IY,J1 = IY,I+ , which is what we needed to show.

4.3 Flowing towards a non-degenerate structure
Let Y ⊂ (M,J1,J2) be a generalized Poisson transversal for J1 with degenerate normal
bundle, and denote by π : ˜M → M the corresponding blow-up. By Lemma 4.2 we know
that the complex structures I± lift to ˜M , and together with π∗g, π∗H and the lift of Q
they form a degenerate bi-Hermitian structure on ˜M . The metric degenerates along the
exceptional divisor E = π−1(Y ), and T ˜M⊥ equals the vertical tangent bundle of the ﬁbration

10In fact as the argument shows, the Jacobi identity plays no role here. Hence this is really a statement about

skew-symmetric brackets.

π : E ∼= P(N Y ) → Y . In order to apply the deformation procedure from Section 3 we need
a suitable potential11 f . This will be based on the following idea (see also [8]). Consider
M and ˜M as complex manifolds with respect to either I+ or I−, and E as a divisor on
˜M with associated holomorphic line bundle O ˜M (−E). Recall that a Hermitian metric on a
holomorphic line bundle induces a unitary connection, whose curvature Rh is of type (1, 1).
Lemma 4.4. If U is any neighborhood of E in ˜M , there exists a metric h on O ˜M (−E) such
that iRh is supported in U and restricts to a positive (1, 1)–form on T ˜M⊥.
Proof. On E we have the tautological line bundle OE(−1) ⊂ π∗N Y whose ﬁber over a point
l ∈ E = P(N Y ) is the corresponding line in N Y . If we equip N Y with a Hermitian metric
then this induces one on OE(−1) and therefore also on OE(1) := OE(−1)∗. Denote the latter
by h(cid:48) and its curvature by Rh(cid:48) . If we set Ey := π−1(y) = P(NyY ) for y ∈ Y , then iRh(cid:48)|Ey
equals (a multiple of) the Fubini-Study form12 on P(NyY ). Now O ˜M (−E)|E ∼= N∗E, the
conormal bundle of E in ˜M , which in turn equals OE(1). We can extend the metric h(cid:48) on
OE(1) to a metric on O ˜M (−E) as follows. Forgetting about the holomorphic structure for
a moment, pick a tubular neighborhood p : V → E with V ⊂ U , and use it to identify
O ˜M (−E)|V ∼= p∗OE(1). Equip O ˜M (−E)|V with the metric p∗h(cid:48) with curvature p∗Rh(cid:48) , which
has the same restriction to all the Ey’s as Rh(cid:48) does. On the complement of E the bundle
O ˜M (−E) is trivial so can be given a ﬂat metric h(cid:48)(cid:48). We let h be equal to h(cid:48)(cid:48) on ˜M\U , p∗h(cid:48) on
a neighborhood of E in V and a suitable interpolation in between. Clearly Rh is compactly
supported in U and iRh|Ey is positive.
It is a well-known fact that if s is any meromorphic section of O ˜M (−E) which is not iden-
tically zero, then iRh = −ddc log |s|. So f := − log |s| is a good candidate for a potential.
Unfortunately, we can not always guarantee smoothness of the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld Q(df ).
The theorem below gives two situations where Q(df ) can be controlled.
Theorem 4.5. Let (M,J1,J2) be a generalized K¨ahler manifold and Y a compact generalized
Poisson submanifold for J1 whose conormal bundle is degenerate. Then if one of the following
conditions holds, the blow-up ˜M with respect to J1 has a generalized K¨ahler structure.

) is Abelian.

i) (N∗Y, [, ]πJ1
ii) Y ⊂ D, where D is a compact Poisson divisor in M with respect to (I+, σ+) or (I−, σ−).
Moreover, in situation i) the generalized K¨ahler structure on the blow-up agrees with the
original structure on the complement of a neighborhood of the exceptional divisor. In situation
ii) the same is true, if we make the additional assumption that OM (D)|Y is trivial. In that
case it is also not necessary to assume that D is compact.

Proof. i): Consider M as a complex manifold with respect to, say, I+. From (4.2) we see
that [, ]Q is Abelian on N∗Y and therefore E ⊂ ˜M is a Poisson submanifold for the lift of
Q. Consider the potential f = − log |s|, where s is a meromorphic section of O ˜M (−E) with
a simple pole along E, and the norm is taken with respect to a metric as in Lemma 4.4. We
claim that Q(df ) extends smoothly to the whole of ˜M . To see this, let x ∈ E and let e be a
local holomorphic section of O ˜M (−E) with e(x) (cid:54)= 0. Then s = 1

Theorem 3.4 we need that (I∗
on Ey is induced from NyY under the isomorphism Ey = P(NyY ). Since Y is generalized
Poisson, both I+ and I− coincide on N Y and preserve it. So Ey is a complex submanifold of
˜M with respect to both I+ and I−, with the same induced complex structure. In particular
+f|Ey is positive. So Theorem 3.4 applies and we obtain a generalized

by the choice of metric in Lemma 4.4 (so in particular can be arbitrarily small).
ii): Let ˜D denote the proper transform13 of D on the blow-up ˜M .
In terms of divisors,
˜D = π∗D−kE for some k ∈ Z>0 and so O ˜M ( ˜D) = O ˜M (−kE)⊗π∗OM (D). Equip O ˜M (−kE) =
O ˜M (−E)⊗k with the metric h⊗k, where h is a metric on O ˜M (−E) as in Lemma 4.4. If h(cid:48) is any
metric on OM (D), the metric h⊗k ⊗ π∗h(cid:48) on O ˜M ( ˜D) satisﬁes iRh⊗k⊗π∗h(cid:48) = ikRh + iπ∗Rh(cid:48) ,
which is positive on T ˜M⊥ since π∗Rh(cid:48) vanishes there. Let s be a holomorphic section of
O ˜M ( ˜D) with a simple zero along ˜D, and deﬁne f := − log |s|. Then ddcf = ikRh + iπ∗Rh(cid:48)
is smooth on ˜M and positive on T ˜M⊥, while the same argument as in i) shows that Q(df )
is smooth, using the fact that ˜D is Poisson. So again Theorem 3.4 applies, but this time the
structure is perturbed along ˜D as well so we can not contain the deformation to a neighborhood
of E. If however we know that OM (D)|Y is trivial, then we can choose h(cid:48) above to be ﬂat
+f = ikRh around E. If s(cid:48) is a section of O ˜M (kE) with a zero of order k
around Y and so ddc
along E and O ˜M (kE) is equipped with the metric dual to h⊗k, we can deﬁne f(cid:48) := −ρ·log |s(cid:48)|,
where ρ is a function which is 0 near E and 1 outside of a neighborhood of E. Then f + f(cid:48) still
has the property that Q(df ) is smooth but in addition satisﬁes ddc(f + f(cid:48)) = 0 on an annulus
around E. We then apply the deformation procedure only on a neighborhood of E, keeping
it ﬁxed on an annulus around it, and then glue the result back to the original structure.

Remark 4.6. i): Suppose that M is a K¨ahler manifold, seen as a generalized K¨ahler mani-
fold as in Example 2.10, and Y is a complex submanifold regarded as a generalized Poisson
submanifold for J1. Then, since πJ1 = 0, N∗Y is Abelian and we are in situation i) of the
Theorem. Equation (3.1) that deﬁnes the ﬂow reduces in this equation to simply adding ddcf
to the symplectic form, and this is how one usually produces a K¨ahler metric on the blow-up.
ii): Let us clarify why we need OM (D)|Y to be trivial if we want to contain the deformation to
a neighborhood of E in situation ii). In the ﬁrst part of the proof we are ﬂowing the structure
by the 2–form ikRh + iπ∗Rh(cid:48) , and in the second part we want to cancel this on an annulus
around E by ddcf(cid:48), where f(cid:48) is a smooth function. In particular we need ikRh + iπ∗Rh(cid:48) to be
exact on the annulus, which is automatic for ikRh since O ˜M (kE)| ˜M\E is trivial. For π∗Rh(cid:48)
to be exact, we need Rh(cid:48) to be exact14 around Y , which amounts to OM (D)|Y being trivial
around Y .
Although condition ii) of the theorem is clear as it is stated, it is unclear whether it has any
applications. For that reason we state the following
Corollary 4.7. Let (M,J1,J2) be generalized K¨ahler with J1 generically of symplectic type
and Y a compact generalized Poisson submanifold for J1 with degenerate normal bundle and
which is contained in the type change locus15 of J1. Then the blow-up is generalized K¨ahler.
Proof. Let X1 be the type change locus for J1.
In a local chart of the form (2.8), X1 is
given by the vanishing of the holomorphic function σk/2 and as such is either empty or a
codimension 1 analytic subset of Cn. We assume X1 (cid:54)= ∅, otherwise the statement is vacuous.
Let D(cid:48) ⊂ M denote the Poisson subvariety of points where Q does not assume its maximal
rank on M . By Lemma 2.14 and Equation (2.12) we have

ker(Q) = ker(I

+ − I
∗

−) ⊕ ker(I
∗

∗
+ + I

−) = ker(πJ1 ) ⊕ ker(πJ2 ).
∗

Consequently, D(cid:48) = X1 ∪ X2, where Xi is the set of points where πJi is not of maximal rank
(or equivalently, where Ji is not of minimal type). Let D be the union of the codimension
1 components of D(cid:48). Then D is also a Poisson subvariety which a priori could be empty,
but we claim that X1 ⊂ D.
Indeed, if x ∈ X1\D, then a neighborhood U of x in X1 is
disjoint from D. However, since U is given by the vanishing of a holomorphic function (for a
complex structure which need not coincide with either I±), an open dense set in U is a smooth
submanifold of M of real dimension 2n − 2. But U ⊂ D(cid:48) , and a real 2n − 2 dimensional
submanifold of a complex manifold can not be contained in a ﬁnite union of analytic subsets
of complex codimension bigger than 1. So indeed X1 ⊂ D and Theorem 4.5 ii) applies.

13By deﬁnition this is the closure of π−1(D)\E in ˜M .
14As Y has complex codimension 2 or bigger (otherwise the blow-up is trivial), the Gysin sequence shows that
15Since J1 is generically symplectic, for Y to be generalized Poisson it has to be either an open set in the

the second degree cohomology of an annulus around Y agrees with that of Y itself.

symplectic locus or fully contained in the type change locus. In the former case there is nothing to blow up.

15

A special case of this corollary is when Y is a point and M is 4–dimensional. This situation
was considered in [8], where it was assumed that the type change locus was smooth at the
point in question. Note that if the type change locus is not smooth at this point, we are in
situation i) of Theorem 4.5 and we can still blow it up.
Remark 4.8. In [11] Goto proved that every compact K¨ahler manifold with a holomorphic
Poisson structure σ has a generalized K¨ahler structure, where J1 is given by the Poisson
deformation of the complex structure and J2 is a suitable deformation of the symplectic
structure. If Y is a complex Poisson submanifold for σ whose conormal bundle is degenerate,
then σ lifts to the complex blow-up of Y , which has a K¨ahler metric of its own(cf. Remark
4.6 i)). Applying Goto’s theorem again, we see that the blow-up is again generalized K¨ahler
and the blow-down map is generalized holomorphic with respect to J1. This example shows
that Theorem 4.5 is not optimal in its assumptions. However, the proof of Goto’s theorem
relies on the use of Green’s operators for ﬁnding the right deformation of J2, and as such is
non-local. In fact, since the K¨ahler metric on the blow-up diﬀers from the original metric
on a neighborhood of the exceptional divisor, there is a-priori nothing we can say about the
relation between J2 on the blow-up and on the original manifold, even far away from the
exceptional divisor. As such, it is not clear how to connect this example with the techniques
used to prove Theorem 4.5.

5 An example: compact Lie groups

One source of examples of generalized K¨ahler manifolds is provided by Lie theory.

Proposition 5.1 ([13]). Let G be an even dimensional compact Lie group. Then G has a
generalized K¨ahler structure.

In order to ﬁnd suitable submanifolds to blow up, we need to understand these generalized
K¨ahler structures in some detail. Let G be any Lie group. An element ξ ∈ g deﬁnes left and
right invariant vector ﬁelds ξL
g := deRg(ξ), and we have [ξL, ηL] = [ξ, η]L,
[ξR, ηR] = −[ξ, η]R. These two trivializations of T G deﬁne connections ∇±, characterized by
∇+ξL = 0 = ∇−ξR for ξ ∈ g. Their torsion is given by
−

g := deLg(ξ) and ξR

T +(ξL, ηL) = −[ξ, η]L,

T

(ξR, ηR) = [ξ, η]R.

Suppose now that G is compact and let (cid:104),(cid:105) be a metric on g which is invariant under the adjoint
action. In particular, its left and right invariant extensions over G coincide and we denote this
common extension by the same symbol (cid:104),(cid:105). The 3–form on g deﬁned by H(ξ, η, ζ) := (cid:104)[ξ, η], ζ(cid:105)
is also invariant under the adjoint action and so extends to a bi-invariant 3–form on G. From
the Jacobi identity it follows that H is closed16 and we have (cid:104)T ±(X, Y ), Z(cid:105) = ∓H(X, Y, Z),
so ∇± coincide with the connections deﬁned in Proposition 2.11.
Since G is compact it is automatically reductive, i.e. its Lie algebra splits as g = a ⊕ g(cid:48),
with a Abelian and g(cid:48) semi-simple. Let t be a maximal Cartan subalgebra of g(cid:48) and g(cid:48)C =
α the associated root space decomposition. Since G is compact the roots are
contained in it ⊂ t∗C, hence they come in pairs ±α and we have g(cid:48)
−α. Consequently,
dim(g(cid:48)) and dim(t) have the same parity and since g is even dimensional it follows that a⊕ t is
even dimensional. Now choose a decomposition R = R−∪R+ into positive and negative roots,
so that in particular −R+ = R−. We deﬁne a complex structure I on g by the decomposition
gC = g1,0 ⊕ g0,1, where

tC ⊕(cid:80)

α = g(cid:48)

α∈R g(cid:48)

g1,0 = (a ⊕ t)1,0 ⊕ (cid:88)

(cid:48)
g
α,

α∈R+

and (a ⊕ t)1,0 is deﬁned with respect to an arbitrary but ﬁxed complex structure on a ⊕ t,
compatible with (cid:104),(cid:105). By invariance of the metric, gα is orthogonal to gβ unless α = −β,
hence I is compatible with (cid:104),(cid:105). Since the sum of two positive roots is again positive it follows
that [g1,0, g1,0] ⊂ g1,0, so the complex structures I+ and I−, which are deﬁned by the left
respectively right invariant extensions of I over G, are integrable. Since they are constant in

16In fact, since H is constant in both trivializations it is parallel with respect to both ∇± and therefore also for

their aﬃne combination ∇ := 1

2 (∇+ + ∇−), which is nothing but the Levi-Cevita connection for (cid:104), (cid:105).

16

the two respective trivializations, we have ∇±I± = 0, so (G,(cid:104),(cid:105), I±, H) is generalized K¨ahler
by Proposition 2.11.
Next we look for generalized Poisson submanifolds for J1. A natural candidate is given
by the complex locus of J1, i.e. the set of points where I+ = I− (see (2.11)). For g ∈ G we
have (I+)g = (Lg)∗I and (I−)g = (Rg)∗I, so that (I+)g = (I−)g if and only if Ad(g)∗I = I.
This condition deﬁnes a subgroup of G whose Lie algebra is given by

{ξ ∈ g| [ad(ξ), I] = 0 ⇔ [ξ, g1,0] ⊂ g1,0}.

One readily veriﬁes that this algebra coincides with a ⊕ t, hence the connected component
of the complex locus that contains the identity equals the connected subgroup T whose Lie
algebra is a ⊕ t. Thus T , or any complex submanifold Y ⊂ T for that matter, is a generalized
Poisson submanifold of (G,J1). To blow up Y in G with respect to J1, we need to understand
the induced Lie algebra structure on N∗Y . Since Y ⊂ T , we have an inclusion of Lie algebras

itself. The only root systems satisfying this are products of A1, corresponding to the Lie
group SU (2). In conclusion, in order to blow up T in G with respect to J1, we need G to be
of the form G = (S1)n × (S3)m for n + m even, with T = (S1)n × (S1)m. We then still have
some residual freedom in choosing the complex submanifold Y ⊂ T . Instead of determining
precisely all Y for which (5.2) becomes degenerate let us give an easy example. If m is even
we can take the complex structure I on g to be a product complex structure, i.e. we can

17

assume that I preserves the decomposition a ⊕ t. Then if Y is of the form Y (cid:48) × (S1)m with
Y (cid:48) ⊂ (S1)n a complex submanifold, (5.2) vanishes on N∗Y , because all roots vanish on aC. If
m is odd, we can choose the complex structure to be a product on (S1)n−1 × (S1 × (S3)m).
Then if Y = Y (cid:48) × (S1)1+m with Y (cid:48) ⊂ (S1)n−1 complex, (5.2) again vanishes on N∗Y . Note
that since in all these cases N∗Y is Abelian, Theorem 4.5 i) applies and we obtain
Theorem 5.2. Let G = (S1)n × (S3)m, where n + m is even, and let T = (S1)n × (S1)m ⊂ G
be a maximal torus. Equip G with a generalized K¨ahler structure as above for which T is
generalized Poisson. If either

i) m is even and Y = Y (cid:48) × (S1)m with Y (cid:48) ⊂ (S1)n complex,

or
ii) m is odd and Y = Y (cid:48) × (S1)m+1 with Y (cid:48) ⊂ (S1)n−1 complex,
then Y can be blown up to a generalized K¨ahler manifold.
