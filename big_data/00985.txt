Abstract

We report on a new concept of cloaking objects in diﬀusive light regime using the paradigm of the

scattering cancellation and mantle cloaking techniques. We show numerically that an object can

be made completely invisible to diﬀusive photon density waves, by tailoring the diﬀusivity constant

of the spherical shell enclosing the object. This means that photons’ ﬂow outside the object and

the cloak made of these spherical shells behaves as if the object were not present. Diﬀusive light

invisibility may open new vistas in hiding hot spots in infrared thermography or tissue imaging.

INTRODUCTION

Invisibility cloaks that were introduced ten years ago1–4 are undoubtedly the most pop-

ular application of artiﬁcial materials5, since they oﬀer an unprecedented control over light

trajectories2.

In order to make objects invisible to electromagnetic radiation, numerous

methods have been suggested in the past few years. The ﬁrst attempt can be traced back

to Kerker and his consideration of core-shell dielectric bodies. He noted forty years ago that

in the static regime, some combinations of dielectric functions lead to cancellation of the

scattering cross-section of coated ellipsoidal and spherical inclusions6,7. Al`u and Engheta

further investigated the scattering cancellation technique and have shown that the use of

plasmonic materials can lead to invisibility via the polarizability engineering of the coating

shell8–10. This technique has the advantage of being robust10 and experimentally realizable11.

It has also many applications in sensing12 or imaging13. Variants of this technique have been

also investigated, e.g. by using plasmonic nano particles for optical cloaking14,15 or mantle

covers16,17. Diﬀerent methods based on homogenization have been also shown to lead to

broadband cloaking of electromagnetic waves18,19.

In the same vein, the scattering cancellation technique has been successfully adapted

to other kinds of waves.

In fact, Chen et al. have shown that spherical objects can be

made invisible to acoustic pressure waves by coating them with ultra-thin tailored shells

with properly designed acoustic impedance20,21. The same technique has shown its potential

even for the scalar elasticity domain (thin-plates), where waves obey the fourth order scalar

biharmonic equation22, or thermal waves23.

In this work, we consider the propagation of diﬀuse photon density waves (DPDW). These

describe the propagation of light waves in a highly scattering medium, i.e. a turbid medium

such as human body tissues, cloud or milk24.

In this case, photons experience multiple

scattering phenomenon before being absorbed by the medium or escaping it. Even though,

the individual photons follow random paths, macroscopically, they behave like a photon

density wave, described by a Helmholtz-like diﬀerential equation and experiencing usual

wave phenomena such as refraction25 scattering26, or even cloaking based on transformation

optics27,28. We will propose thus to analyze the scattering of DPDW from core-shell struc-

tures and derive the conditions of scattering cancellation and resonant scattering regimes.

The latter scenario may have promising applications in medical tissue imaging29 by rendering

objects more visible or improving the capabilities of HAMR technology30.

II. DISPERSION RELATION OF DIFFUSE PHOTON DENSITY WAVES

Using the ﬁrst principle of thermodynamics in a closed system, one can show that (in

the absence of radiation and convection) the photon number density Φ(r) or the photons
ﬂuence obeys the relation ∇ · j + ∂Φ/∂t + υµaΦ + υς = 0. Here, j, υ, µa, ς, and Φ represent
the photon current density (photons ﬂow per unit surface per unit time), the speed of light

in the diﬀusive medium, the absorption coeﬃcient, the source of photons, and the photons

ﬂuence ﬁeld, respectively. Using Fick’s ﬁrst law, i.e. the linear and instantaneous relation
j = −D∇φ, one can derive that

approximation µa (cid:28) µ(cid:48)
s is called the P1 approximation31–33 and is necessary to have the
simpliﬁed form of Eq. (1). Assuming a piecewise constant diﬀusivity, the equation for Φ
becomes in the time harmonic regime (e−iωt)

a complex pseudo-wavenumber κ related to the frequency through the dispersion relation
κ2 = (iω−υµa)/D. Using the parameters of water, i.e. a diﬀusivity D0 = 1.75×106 m2/s and
a lifetime of the photons 1/(υ0µa,0) = 30×10−9s, with the subscript 0 denoting the surround-
ing medium properties, the dispersion relation of photons is shown in Fig. 1(b). In particular,

one can notice that the real part (cid:60)(κ0) tends asymptotical to the limit(cid:112)υ0µa,0/D0 when

the frequency goes to zero, and is much higher than the imaginary part, due to absorption.

At higher frequencies (ω >> υ0µa,0), the real and imaginary parts are equal [since κ2

0 is

purely imaginary, as can be seen from the low frequency regime in Fig. 1(b)].

III. SCATTERING CANCELLATION MODELING FOR DPDW

In this section, we assume that generation of macroscopic waves (DPDW) from sinu-

soidally modulated point sources in a turbid medium is possible25,34. These are spherical

waves that propagate outwards from the point source, and are incident on a core-shell

(spherical) structure, as schematized in Fig. 1(a). The scattering (and absorbing) object

(properties are indexed with subscript 1) is coated with a cloaking shell of tailored parame-

ters (properties are indexed with subscript 2). It can be shown (as generally done for other

kinds of waves8) that the ﬂuence (or photons density) Φ can be found by constructing a

general solution in the diﬀerent domains [0, 1 and 2 as shown in Fig. 1(a)] and applying

the convenient boundary conditions. Without loss of generality, we assume the origin of the

spherical coordinates to coincide with the center of the core-shell.

A. Heterogeneous scatterers

Let us consider to begin, heterogeneous scattering objects, i.e. with ﬁnite values for

D1 and υ1µa,1. Outside the structure (region 0), the general solution is the well-known

superposition of incident and scattered waves, i.e. Φ0 = Φinc + Φscat, where

r and rs denote the positions of the detector and the source, respectively, and r< and r> is
the smaller and larger of r and rs, respectively. The ∗ denotes the complex conjugate. The
wave scattered from the structure can be expressed as

Inside the core (i.e. r ≤ r1), the solution is

Inside the cloaking shell (i.e. r1 < r ≤ r2), the solution is

are spherical Bessel functions of the ﬁrst, second kind and the Hankel

denote the complex wave numbers in the diﬀerent regions of space (i.e. regions 0, 1, and

2, respectively). The coeﬃcients of the developments (al,m, bl,m, cl,m, and sl,m) can be
determined using the following assumptions: (i) Φ is ﬁnite for r (cid:54)= rs. (ii) When r → ∞,
Φ0 tends asymptotically to a spherically outgoing wave. (iii) The normal component of the

ﬂux is continuous, that is D1∂Φ1/∂r = D2∂Φ2/∂r and D2∂Φ2/∂r = D0∂Φ0/∂r for r = r1
and r = r2, respectively. (iv) Φ is continuous, i.e. Φ1(r1) = Φ2(r1) and Φ2(r2) = Φ0(r2).

Without loss of generality, and to simplify the calculations, we assume that the source is
located on the z-axis (i.e. θs = π and φs = 0). This means that the terms for which m (cid:54)= 0
are identically zero. These boundary conditions yield, therefore, the diﬀerent coeﬃcients.
In particular, the scattering coeﬃcients sl can be re-expressed as sl = −ψl/ (ψl + iχl). Here
ψl and χl are given by the complex-valued determinants

(9)

In the limit of small scatterers (long diﬀusion length κ0r1,2 (cid:28) 1), only few scattering orders
contribute to the SCS. Here, we assume that the ﬁrst two orders (l = 0 for the monopole, and

l = 1 for the dipole mode, unlike in the electromagnetic case, where the ﬁrst dominant mode
is the dipole one) are signiﬁcant. In this scenario, one has σscat ≈ 4π/(|κ0|2) (|s0|2 + 3|s1|2).
Consequently, canceling these two modes, i.e. ψ0 = 0 and ψ1 = 0, will ensure that σscat ≈ 0,
and the diﬀusive scattering from the object will be suppressed. Namely, the SCT conditions

on the parameters of the cloaking shell D2, υ2µa,2, and r2 are

υ2µa,2 − υ1µa,1

(D0 − D2)(D1 + 2D2)
(D1 − D2)(D0 + 2D2)

= γ3, for ψ1 = 0,

(11)

with γ = r1/r2. The monopole SCT condition in Eq. (10), depends on the product of the

photons’ velocity and the absorption coeﬃcient of the shell, and the ratio of radii of the

object and the shell γ. Likewise, the condition in Eq. (11) depends only on the diﬀusivity

coeﬃcient of the shell and γ. By enforcing these two conditions, the total scattering from

the spherical object can be suppressed in the limit of small scatterers.

space, we can approximate the scattering coeﬃcient using the leading terms in the Bessel

that the condition that ensures that ψ1 = 0 (to the leading order) can be given

C. Ultra-thin invisibility shells: mantle cloaking

It has been recently shown that a patterned metasurface can produce signiﬁcant cloaking

eﬃciency using simpler and thinner geometries16,20,21. The setup of the scattering problem

is identical to what was discussed earlier, except that the scattering reduction is achieved

here by a 3D surface, instead of a thick shell. Our aim in the following is to show the

possibility of drastically reducing the scattering from spherical heterogeneities by properly

tailoring the surface impedance. There are two boundary conditions that should be satisﬁed

at the surface of both spherical obstacle (on r = r1) and the cloak (r = r2). Across the

7

boundary r = r1, we have the same conditions as in sub-section 3.1 (i.e. continuity of Φ
and the normal component of its ﬂux Di∂Φi/∂r. On the boundary of the mantle cloak,

however, we have to consider the diﬀusive surface impedance which implies a jump of the

normal component of the ﬂux. And the boundary condition becomes

The lth spherical scattering order can be suppressed provided that the following deter-

where η = iω/(ZdD0κ0αl) is a dimensionless function that accounts for the diﬀusive surface

impedance. In the limit of large wavelengths, the spherical Bessel functions can be simpliﬁed

This clearly demonstrates that by properly choosing the diﬀusive surface reactance (Xd), it

is possible, in the quasistatic limit, to suppress the few dominant scattering multipoles.

IV. NUMERICAL MODELING

A.

Ideal cloaking parameters

The monopole SCT condition of Eq. (10), depends merely on the product of the speed of

light and the absorption coeﬃcient of the cloaking shell, and the ratio of radii γ. Similarly,

the condition of Eq. (11) depends only on the scattering coeﬃcient of the cloaking shell and γ.

s,1 and the ratio γ. (d) Scattering coeﬃcient

By enforcing these two conditions, one is able to cancel the total scattering from the spherical

object, in the limit of small scatterers (dilute limit). It can be seen from Figs. 2(a)-2(c), the

numerical solutions to Eqs. (10), (11), where the variation of the absorption coeﬃcient µa,2
and the scattering coeﬃcient µ(cid:48)
s,2 were plotted as function of the aspect ratio of obstacle to
shell radius γ and µa,1 and µ(cid:48)
s,2, respectively. For the ﬁrst case, given in Fig. 2(a), solution
of Eq. (10), one can see that the absorption coeﬃcient of the shell (µa,2), given here in

logarithmic scale, takes positive and negative values, depending on γ and the absorption

of the object. The red thick line represents the curve obeying the equation γ3µa,1/µa,0 =

1, meaning that µa,2 = 0. The absorption coeﬃcient takes thus negative (respectively

in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c), solutions of Eq. (11), it can be seen that the required scattering
coeﬃcient of the shell µ(cid:48)
s,2 needs to be either positive [Fig. 2(b)] or negative [Fig. 2(c)], for
varying γ and µ(cid:48)
s,1, in order to satisfy Eq. (11) that has two solutions. However, for a small
perfectly absorbing object, the scattering coeﬃcient of the shell depends only on the ratio
γ and is always positive, varying from µ(cid:48)

s,0 to values close to zero, following Eq. (16).

B. Canceling the SCS

Let us consider in this sub-section two particular scenarios, where scattering of DPDW

from spherical heterogeneities is analyzed. The background, i.e.
turbid medium has a
s,0 = 6cm−1 and an absorption coeﬃcient µa,0 = 0.023cm−1 (the P1
scattering coeﬃcient µ(cid:48)
approximation is largely valid here). Two kinds of heterogeneities are considered here: a scat-
tering object and an absorbing object. For the ﬁrst kind (scattering), we have µ(cid:48)
s,1 = 15cm−1
s,0 and µa,1 = 0.15cm−1. The
and µa,1 = µa,0. For the latter (absorbing), we have µ(cid:48)
radii of both objects are r1 = 1.2cm. The design turbid medium wavenumber is cho-

s,1 = µ(cid:48)

10

(a) (b) sen as κ0r1 = 0.5. These two spheres are then coated with an invisibility shell of radius
r2 = 1.125r1 = 1.35cm, and designed scattering and absorption coeﬃcients µ(cid:48)
s,2 and µa,2,
respectively. We then compute the scattering cross-section of the total structure, using

Eq. (9), and normalize it with respect to the SCS of the respective bare objects. The re-

sulting σscat are plotted (in logarithmic scale) in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) for the scattering and
absorbing objects, respectively. By varying µ(cid:48)
s,2 and µa,2 of the shell, we can observe that
there are regions (dark) corresponding to huge scattering reduction, whereas light (white)

regions correspond to increased scattering from the structure. For the scattering object
[Fig. 3(a)], values of µ(cid:48)
s,2 between 1.5 and 3.75 and µa,2 between 0.01 and 0.045 are ideal for
DPDW scattering cancellation (black spot). In particular, the minimum of σscat is obtained

for the coordinates (2.1, 0.028) that ﬁts very well with the predictions of Eqs. (10), and (11).
For the absorbing object [Fig. 3(b)], values of µ(cid:48)
and -0.28 are ideal for DPDW scattering cancellation (black spot).

s,2 between 1 and 15 and µa,2 between -0.15

In particular, the minimum of σscat is obtained for the coordinates (7, -0.25) that ﬁts

as well with the predictions of Eqs. (10), and (11). By comparing Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), we
can notice also that in the ﬁrst case, sensitivity to µ(cid:48)
s,2 is more evident, since the object is
of scattering nature, whereas in the latter scenario, we can notice more sensitivity to µa,2.

This can be clearly seen from the shape of the spots (elongated in the y and x directions,

respectively). It is interesting to obtain, from numerical simulations, taking into account

many scattering orders, huge scattering reduction, sensibly around the same coordinates,

with values of almost -45 dB. The quasistatic analysis, considered in our contribution, shows

the importance of considering the eﬀect of both the scattering and absorption coeﬃcients of

the shell.

C. Far-ﬁeld SCS

To further illustrate the capability of the proposed SCT cloaks for DPDW, far-ﬁeld scat-

tering patterns are shown in Figs. 4(a)-4(d). These plot the scattering amplitude in polar
coordinates, in the x − y plane [due to the symmetry of the structure as can be seen in
Fig. 1(a)]. The bare scattering and absorbing far-ﬁelds are given in Figs. 4(a) and 4(c),

respectively, and signiﬁcant scattering can be noticed. The cloaked structures, using the

optimal parameters deduced from Fig. 3 are given for comparison in Figs. 4(b) and 4(d),

11

respectively. These plots show that both types of heterogeneities can be made almost unde-

tectable at all angles.

D. Mantle cloaking

wavenumber κ0r1 of the mantle cloak [schematized in Fig. 5(a)] for two radii of the mantle

the surface reactance Xd does not vary with frequency (this may be a good approximation

around a range of wavenumbers around κ0r1). The uncloaked scenario (long-dashed line)

and an uncloaked particle of radius r = r2 is also drawn for a fair comparison. It is evident

that an excellent scattering reduction can be achieved over a large range of frequencies for

both cases. Figures 5(c), 5(d) map of the amplitude of the DPDW diﬀusing at a time instant

When it is surrounded by the cloak, both forward and backward

scattering are nearly vanished, with not too much diﬀerence between the DPDW diﬀusing

in homogeneous medium and the wave bent by the cloak. This reduction of scattering is

achieved thanks to the proper choice of the surface diﬀusive impedance (reactance), which

restores almost uniform amplitude all around the cloak.

V. SUMMARY

To conclude, we have studied analytically and numerically cloaking mechanism based

on the scattering cancellation technique in the context of diﬀuse photon density waves. In

particular, we have shown that both a cloaking shell with convenient diﬀusivity and photon

lifetime or mantle shell with tailored impedance, can drastically reduce the scattering from

a spherical obstacle. We believe that our results help making the cloaking theory one step

closer to its practical realization for diﬀusive light. This mechanism can also be used to build

noninvasive medical imaging devices (e.g., ultrasound imaging) with moderately broadband

features.

Finally, Our analysis of the light diﬀusion equation carried out in this paper has unveiled

some new mathematical and physical features of DPDW cloaking, unseen in the context of

heat diﬀusion, but also in acoustic, optical or mechanical waves. Geometric transform based

designs of light diﬀusion cloaks should thus lead to a whole new range of exciting eﬀects

that would require speciﬁc theoretical, numerical and experimental investigation.
