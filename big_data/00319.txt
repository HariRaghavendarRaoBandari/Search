NAKAMAYE’S THEOREM ON COMPLEX MANIFOLDS

VALENTINO TOSATTI

Abstract. We discuss Nakamaye’s Theorem and its recent extension
to compact complex manifolds, together with some applications.

1. Introduction

Nakamaye’s Theorem [44] characterizes the augmented base locus of a nef
and big line bundle on a smooth projective variety over C as the union of all
subvarieties where the restriction of the line bundle is not big (the so-called
null locus of the bundle). While this result was originally motivated by
applications to diophantine approximation problems [46], it has become an
extremely useful tool in a variety of settings. Many generalizations of this
result are known, including the cases of singular varieties, of R-divisors, and
of other ground ﬁelds [2, 9, 13, 29, 45]. This article discusses a transcendental
generalization of Nakamaye’s Theorem, which deals with (1, 1) classes on
compact complex manifolds, and was obtained recently by Collins and the
author [16]. The techniques we used are analytic, and thus also give a new
proof of Nakamaye’s original statement, and its generalization to R-divisors.
We start in section 2 by giving a brief introduction to transcendental
techniques in algebraic/analytic geometry, focusing on the basic results and
deﬁnitions that we will need later, and explaining how these relate to their
algebraic counterparts. In particular, we explain a result of Boucksom [3]
which gives a transcendental characterization of the augmented base locus
of an R-divisor. Nakamaye’s Theorem and its generalization to complex
manifolds are stated in section 3. Section 4 contains several applications
of this result, including new proofs (and generalizations) of theorems by
Demailly-P˘aun [24], Fujita-Zariski [33, 64], Takayama [53], a discussion of
Seshadri constants for (1, 1) classes, and applications to the K¨ahler-Ricci
ﬂow and to Ricci-ﬂat Calabi-Yau metrics. Lastly, in section 5 we give a
detailed outline of the proof of the main theorem.

While the techniques we use are analytic, and most of the results are
stated for general compact complex manifolds, we have strived to make this
article accessible to algebraic geometers, by providing the algebraic coun-
terparts (or special cases) of the analytic results which are proved. It is our
hope that this will make these ideas known to a wider audience.

2. Basic results

Throughout this paper, X will denote a compact complex manifold (unless
otherwise stated), of complex dimension n. We will denote by ω a given
Hermitian metric on X.

2.1. (1,1) classes. Let α be a closed real (1, 1) form on X, and denote by
[α] its class in the (ﬁnite-dimensional) Bott-Chern cohomology group

H 1,1(X, R) = {d-closed real (1, 1) forms}
{√−1∂∂f | f ∈ C ∞(X, R)}

.

We will call [α] simply a (1, 1) class. If L → X is a holomorphic line bundle,
and h is a smooth Hermitian metric on L, then its curvature form is given
locally by

√−1

2π

Rh = −

∂∂ log h.

This deﬁnes a global closed real (1, 1) form on X, and if h′ is another metric
on L then the ratio h
h′ is a globally deﬁned smooth positive function, and
we have

Rh − Rh′ = −

√−1

2π

∂∂ log

h
h′ .

This shows that there is a well-deﬁned class c1(L) := [Rh] ∈ H 1,1(X, R).
We will say that two holomorphic line bundles L, L′ on X are numerically
equivalent if c1(L) = c1(L′).

The real vector subspace of H 1,1(X, R) spanned by all classes of the form
c1(L) as L varies among all holomorphic line bundles on X deﬁnes the real
N´eron-Severi group N 1(X, R) ⊂ H 1,1(X, R), which is in general a strictly
smaller subspace, and (1, 1) classes which are outside of it are usually referred
to as transcendental.

2.2. Positivity notions. We now introduce several basic notions of posi-
tivity for (1, 1) classes, which generalize the corresponding notions for line
bundles over projective manifolds.

Let [α] be a (1, 1) class on a compact complex manifold X, where α is a

closed real (1, 1) form. We deﬁne the following positivity notions:

NAKAMAYE’S THEOREM ON COMPLEX MANIFOLDS

3

X, for some ε > 0.

• [α] is K¨ahler if it contains a representative which is a K¨ahler form,
i.e. if there is a smooth function ϕ such that α + √−1∂∂ϕ > εω on
• [α] is nef if for every ε > 0 there is a smooth function ϕε such that
α + √−1∂∂ϕε > −εω holds on X.
if there exists an L1
• [α] is big if it contains a K¨ahler current, i.e.
upper-semicontinuous (usc) function ϕ : X → R ∪ {−∞} such that
α + √−1∂∂ϕ > εω holds weakly as currents on X, for some ε > 0.
• [α] is pseudoeﬀective if it contains a closed positive current, i.e.
if there exists an L1 usc function ϕ : X → R ∪ {−∞} such that
α + √−1∂∂ϕ > 0 holds weakly as currents.
Clearly every K¨ahler class is nef and big, and every big class is pseudoef-
fective. Also, using weak compactness of currents in a ﬁxed class, it is easy
to see that every nef class is pseudoeﬀective (and there are in general no
other implications among these notions).

As shown by Demailly [21, Proposition 4.2], if X is projective and if [α] =
c1(L) for a holomorphic line bundle L, then these notions are equivalent to
their algebraic counterparts. More precisely:

theorem)

all large m)

• c1(L) is K¨ahler iﬀ L is ample (this is just the Kodaira embedding
• c1(L) is nef iﬀ L is nef (i.e. (L · C) > 0 for all curves C ⊂ X)
• c1(L) is big iﬀ L is big (i.e. h0(X, Lm) > cmn for some c > 0 and
• c1(L) is pseudoeﬀective iﬀ L is pseudoeﬀective (i.e. c1(L) lies in the
closed cone in N 1(X, R) generated by classes of eﬀective R-divisors)
In particular, all of these notions are numerical. Furthermore, these equiv-
alences extend immediately to the case when we replace L by an R-divisor
D.

The following result of Demailly-P˘aun [24, Theorem 2.12] will be crucial:

Theorem 2.1 (Demailly-P˘aun [24]). Let X be a compact complex manifold
in Fujiki’s class C and [α] a (1, 1) class which is nef and satisﬁes

ZX

αn > 0.

Then [α] is big.

Recall here that X being in Fujiki’s class C [32] means that there exists a
modiﬁcation µ : ˜X → X, obtained as a composition of blowups with smooth
centers, such that ˜X is a compact K¨ahler manifold.
When X is projective and [α] = c1(L), Theorem 2.1 is just a simple
consequence of Riemann-Roch, see [42, Theorem 2.2.16]. In general, this re-
sult uses the “mass concentration” technique for Monge-Amp`ere equations,
which was pioneered by Demailly [22]. A simpler proof of Theorem 2.1 was
recently obtained by Chiose [14] (see also [57] for an exposition of this and
related topics).

VALENTINO TOSATTI

We close this subsection with a remark about closed positive currents. If

T = α + √−1∂∂ϕ > 0 is such a current on X, where ϕ is L1 usc, and µ :
˜X → X is a holomorphic map such whose image is not contained in the locus
{ϕ = −∞}, then we can deﬁne a pullback current µ∗T = µ∗α+√−1∂∂(µ∗ϕ),
where µ∗ϕ = ϕ◦ µ, and this will still be closed positive on ˜X. In particular,
if ι : V → X is the inclusion of a submanifold, which is not contained in
{ϕ = −∞}, then we will write T|V := ι∗T .
On the other hand, if f : X → Y is any holomorphic map, the push-
forward current f∗T (deﬁned as usual by duality, using the pullback map
f ∗ on diﬀerential forms) is also a closed positive current on Y .
If f is a
modiﬁcation, then we have that f∗f ∗ acts as the identity on closed positive
currents (and on smooth forms). From this it follows easily that in this case
if T is a K¨ahler current on X then f∗T is a K¨ahler current on Y .

2.3. Base loci. Let L be a holomorphic line bundle over a compact complex
manifold X. The base locus of L is deﬁned as

Bs(L) = \s∈H 0(X,L)

{s = 0}.

This is a closed analytic subvariety of X. The stable base locus of L is the
closed analytic subvariety deﬁned by

B(L) = \m>1

Bs(Lm).

By the local Noetherian property of analytic subsets, there exists m > 1
such that B(L) = Bs(Lm).
In general these loci also carry the structure
of complex analytic subspaces of X (or subschemes if X is projective), but
we will not make use of it, and when considering analytic subvarieties we
always disregard this extra structure.

We can also deﬁne the stable base locus B(D) for D a Q-divisor, as the
intersection of the base loci of mD over all m > 1 such that mD is an
integral divisor, and hence deﬁnes a line bundle.

In general the stable base locus is not a numerical invariant, in the sense
that there exist line bundles with the same ﬁrst Chern class but with diﬀerent
stable base loci, see e.g.
[42, Example 10.3.3]. To get around this issue,
Nakamaye [44] introduced the augmented base locus of a line bundle L over
a projective manifold, deﬁned by

B+(L) = \ε∈Q>0

B(L − εA),

where A is any ﬁxed ample line bundle over X, and L − εA is regarded as
a Q-divisor. This is clearly a closed analytic subvariety of X, and it is easy
to see that it is independent of the choice of A, and that it is a numerical
invariant. A systematic study of augmented base loci was initiated in [28],
which also contains the proofs of these assertions.

NAKAMAYE’S THEOREM ON COMPLEX MANIFOLDS

5

It is also easy to extend this deﬁnition to R-divisors, by setting

B+(D) =\A

B(D − A),

where D is an R-divisor and the intersection is over all ample R-divisors A
such that D − A is a Q-divisor. This deﬁnition agrees with the previous one
when D is an integral divisor (see [28]).
Apart from being a numerical invariant of the R-divisor D, the augmented
base locus B+(D) has several useful properties. For example, B+(D) 6= X
iﬀ D is big, and B+(D) = ∅ iﬀ D is ample (see again [28]). If L is a line
bundle, then the complement of B+(L) is the largest Zariski open subset
such that for all large and divisible m the Kodaira map

X\B(L) → PH 0(X, Lm),

deﬁned by sections in H 0(X, Lm) is an isomorphism onto its image (see [7,
Theorem A]).

2.4. The non-K¨ahler locus. In the previous subsection we deﬁned the
augmented base locus of an R-divisor on a projective manifold. Following
Boucksom [5], we now generalize this to an arbitrary (1, 1) class [α] on a
compact complex manifold X, by deﬁning the non-K¨ahler locus EnK(α) of
[α].

If [α] is not big then we simply set EnK(α) = X, while if [α] is big (i.e.

it contains K¨ahler currents) we set

EnK(α) = \T ∈[α]

Sing(T ),

where the intersection ranges over all K¨ahler currents T = α + √−1∂∂ϕ in
the class [α], and we have deﬁned Sing(T ) to be the complement of the set
of points x ∈ X such that ϕ is smooth near x. Boucksom observed in [5,
Theorem 3.17] that in fact there exists a K¨ahler current T in [α] with

EnK (α) = Sing(T ).

Furthermore, Demailly’s fundamental regularization theorem for currents

[20] implies that we may assume that T = α + √−1∂∂ϕ has analytic sin-
gularities, which means that there exist a coherent ideal sheaf I ⊂ OX and
c ∈ R>0, such that for every x ∈ X there exist an open neighborhood U of
x, ﬁnitely many generators {fj} of I over U and a continuous function h on
U such that

ϕ = c logXj

|fj|2 + h,

holds on U . In particular, for such a current T we have that Sing(T ) is a
closed analytic subvariety of X (which is the underlying set of the analytic
subspace of X deﬁned by I). Therefore, EnK(α) is always a closed analytic
subvariety. We record this result as a theorem:

6

VALENTINO TOSATTI

Theorem 2.2 (Boucksom [5]). Let X be a compact complex manifold and
[α] a big (1, 1) class. Then there exists a K¨ahler current on X in the class
[α] with analytic singularities precisely along the analytic set EnK(α).

This implies that if [α] is a big (1, 1) class, given any point x 6∈ EnK(α)
we can ﬁnd a global K¨ahler current T on X in the class [α] which is in fact
a smooth K¨ahler metric in a neighborhood of x. In particular, we see that
EnK(α) = ∅ iﬀ [α] is a K¨ahler class.
The connection with the algebraic setting is then provided by the following
result, essentially due to Boucksom [3, Corollary 2.2.8]. We reproduce here
the proof given in [16, Proposition 2.4].

Theorem 2.3 (Boucksom [3]). Let X be a projective manifold, and D an
R-divisor on X. Then

B+(D) = EnK(c1(D)).

Proof. As we recalled earlier, we have that D is big iﬀ c1(D) is big. Therefore
if D is not big then we have B+(D) = EnK (c1(D)) = X, and so we may
assume that D is big.

First we show that EnK(c1(D)) ⊂ B+(D). If x 6∈ B+(D) then by deﬁnition
there exists an ample R-divisor A such that D − A is a Q-divisor and its
stable base locus does not contain x. Therefore there is m > 1 such that
m(D−A) is the divisor of a line bundle L and there is a section s ∈ H 0(X, L)
with s(x) 6= 0. Complete it to a basis {s = s1, s2, . . . , sN} of H 0(X, L), and
ﬁx a smooth Hermitian metric h on L with curvature form Rh. Then

T = Rh +

√−1

is a closed positive current in c1(L), with analytic singularities and which
is smooth near x. If ω is a K¨ahler metric in the class c1(A), then 1
m T + ω
is then a K¨ahler current on X in c1(D) which is smooth near x, and so
x 6∈ EnK(c1(D)).
To see the reverse inclusion, assume x 6∈ EnK(c1(D)) so that by Theorem
2.2 we can ﬁnd a K¨ahler current T in the class c1(D) with analytic singular-
ities which is smooth in a coordinate patch U containing x. We can ﬁnd an
ample line bundle A and a small δ′ > 0 such that D−δ′A is a Q-divisor. If ω
is a K¨ahler metric in c1(A), then there exists 0 < δ < δ′ with δ′ − δ ∈ Q and
such that T − δω is still a K¨ahler current. Then D − δA is a big Q-divisor.
Let θ be a smooth cutoﬀ function supported in U and identically 1 near x,
and let

˜T = T − δω + ε√−1∂∂(θ log |z − x|2),

where ε > 0 is chosen small enough so that ˜T is a K¨ahler current in c1(D −
δA). By construction, the Lelong number ν( ˜T , x) is equal to ε, and ˜T
is smooth on U\{x}. Let γ be a smooth representative of c1(KX ), and
let ˜Tm = m ˜T − γ. For m suﬃciently large, ˜Tm is a K¨ahler current in
c1(m(D − δA) − KX ), which is smooth on U\{x} and with Lelong number

NAKAMAYE’S THEOREM ON COMPLEX MANIFOLDS

7

ν( ˜Tm, x) = mε.
If m is suﬃciently divisible, then m(D − δA) − KX is
the divisor of a holomorphic line bundle Lm, which is big. Applying [21,
Corollary 3.3] (which is an application of H¨ormander’s L2 estimates for ∂)
we see that if we choose m large so that mε > 1, then H 0(X, KX + Lm) =
H 0(X, m(D − δA)) generates 0-jets at x. Hence, there is a global section of
m(D − δA) which does not vanish at x, and so x 6∈ B+(D).

(cid:3)

The following result is well-known (see e.g.

[16, Lemma 3.1], and [29,

Proposition 1.1] in the algebraic case).

Proposition 2.4. Let X be a compact complex manifold and [α] a real (1, 1)
class. Then EnK(α) does not have any isolated points.

In particular, this property holds for the augmented base locus B+(L)
for any line bundle L on a projective manifold.
In fact, it also holds for
the stable base locus B(L), but this is a much deeper result of Zariski [64],
which we will present below in subsection 4.2.

α + A√−1∂∂|z|2 > ω,

lytic singularities along EnK (α), which exists by Theorem 2.2. In particular,

Proof. Recall that EnK(α) = X iﬀ [α] is not big. Therefore we may assume
that [α] is big. Assume that x is an isolated point in EnK(α), and choose a
chart U centered at x with coordinates {z1, . . . , zn} such that U ∩ EnK(α) =
{x}. Choose a constant A > 0 suﬃciently large so that
on U . Choose K = α +√−1∂∂ϕ a K¨ahler current in the class [α] with ana-
ϕ is smooth on U\{x} and ϕ(x) = −∞. If gmax denotes a regularized max-
is equal to ϕ near ∂U and equal to A|z|2 − C near x. Hence ψ is smooth
on U , and it glues to ϕ on X\U to give a global function ψ with analytic
singularities so that α + √−1∂∂ψ is a K¨ahler current on X in the class [α]
with analytic singularities and smooth near x. Hence x 6∈ EnK (α), which is
a contradiction.

imum function (see [23, I.5.18]), then we can choose a large constant C > 0
so that the function on U

ψ := gmax(ϕ, A|z|2 − C),

(cid:3)

For later applications, we need one more property of the non-K¨ahler locus,

which was observed in [6, Proposition 2.3] in the algebraic setting.
Proposition 2.5. Let µ : ˜X → X be a modiﬁcation between compact com-
plex manifolds. If [α] is a (1, 1) class on X then

where Exc(µ) is the exceptional locus of µ.

EnK(µ∗α) = µ−1(EnK (α)) ∪ Exc(µ),

Proof. Since the pushforward of a K¨ahler current is also a K¨ahler current,
we see that if [α] is not big then µ∗[α] is not big either. As remarked earlier,
[α] is not big iﬀ EnK(α) = X, and therefore we may assume that [α] is big.

8

VALENTINO TOSATTI

We may also assume that Exc(µ) 6= ∅, otherwise µ is a biholomorphism and
the result is obvious.
First, let x 6∈ EnK(µ∗α) so there exists a K¨ahler current T = µ∗α +
√−1∂∂ϕ which is smooth near x. If x ∈ Exc(µ), Zariski’s main theorem
implies that there exists an irreducible component E of the ﬁber µ−1(µ(x))
which is positive dimensional. Using embedded resolution of singularities,
we may assume that E is smooth. Then T can be restricted to E since T is
smooth near x, and we have

T|E = (µ∗α + √−1∂∂ϕ)|E = √−1∂∂(ϕ|E ) > ε˜ω|E,

for some ε > 0 and Hermitian metric ˜ω on ˜X. Hence ϕ|E is strictly plurisub-
harmonic, but since E is compact and connected ϕ|E must be constant,
which is a contradiction.
Therefore x 6∈ Exc(µ), and so µ is an isomorphism near x. Hence µ∗T is a
K¨ahler current on X in the class [α] which is smooth near µ(x), i.e. µ(x) 6∈
EnK(α). We have thus proved that µ−1(EnK(α)) ∪ Exc(µ) ⊂ EnK(µ∗α).
Assume conversely that x 6∈ µ−1(EnK (α)) ∪ Exc(µ). First, let us assume
that µ is a composition of blowups with smooth centers. Then µ is an
isomorphism near x and there is a K¨ahler current T on X in the class [α]
which is smooth near µ(x). Then µ∗T is a closed positive current on ˜X in
the class µ∗[α] which is smooth near x, and which satisﬁes µ∗T > εµ∗ω as
currents on ˜X, where ω is a Hermitian metric on X and ε > 0.

We now perturb µ∗T in its class to make it a K¨ahler current. More
speciﬁcally, we claim that there is an L1 usc function f , smooth near x,

such that µ∗ω + √−1∂∂f is a K¨ahler current on ˜X. Consider ﬁrst the case

when µ is the blowup of X along a smooth submanifold, with exceptional
divisor E. Then it is well-known (see e.g. [24, Lemma 3.5]) that we can ﬁnd
δ > 0 and a smooth closed real (1, 1) form η on ˜X, in the same cohomology
class as the current of integration [E], such that µ∗ω − δη is a K¨ahler metric
on ˜X. Writing η = [E] − √−1∂∂h for some L1 usc function h, smooth oﬀ
E, we have that

(2.1)

µ∗ω + δ√−1∂∂h = µ∗ω − δη + δ[E] > µ∗ω − δη,

is a K¨ahler current. So in this case the claim is proved, with f = δh. The
general case when µ is a composition of blowups with smooth centers follows
similarly.

It follows that µ∗T + ε√−1∂∂f > εµ∗ω + ε√−1∂∂f is a K¨ahler current
on ˜X, in the class µ∗[α], which is smooth near x. Therefore, x 6∈ EnK (µ∗α),
as desired.
Lastly, we consider the case when µ is a general modiﬁcation. By resolving
the indeterminacies of the bimeromorphic map µ−1 : X 99K ˜X, we obtain
a modiﬁcation ν : Y → X, which is a composition of blowups with smooth
centers, and a holomorphic map µ′ : Y → ˜X such that µ ◦ µ′ = ν, and ν is
an isomorphism outside µ(Exc(µ)), so in particular near µ(x). The map µ′
is bimeromorphic, and it is an isomorphism near x because x 6∈ Exc(µ). We

NAKAMAYE’S THEOREM ON COMPLEX MANIFOLDS

also have µ(x) 6∈ EnK (α) by assumption. If y ∈ Y is the preimage of µ(x)
under the local isomorphism ν, then there is a K¨ahler current T on X in the
class [α] which is smooth near µ(x), and then ν ∗T is a closed positive current
on Y in the class ν ∗[α] which is smooth near y and satisﬁes ν ∗T > εν ∗ω as
currents on Y , where ω is a Hermitian metric on X and ε > 0. Since ν is a
composition of blowups with smooth centers, our previous argument shows
that there is a K¨ahler current ˜T on Y in the class ν ∗[α] which is smooth near
˜T is a K¨ahler current on ˜X in the class µ′
∗µ′∗µ∗[α] =
y. Then µ′
µ∗[α], smooth near x, i.e. x 6∈ EnK(µ∗α), as required.

3. The main theorem

3.1. The null locus. Let X be a projective manifold and L a nef line bundle
over X. As mentioned earlier, c1(L) is nef, in the sense that for every ε > 0

there exists a smooth function ϕε such that Rh + √−1∂∂ϕε > −εω on X,

where ω is a K¨ahler metric on X, h is any ﬁxed smooth Hermitian metric
on L and Rh is its curvature form (which represents c1(L)). In particular,
if V ⊂ X is a positive-dimensional irreducible analytic subvariety of X then
we have

(3.1)

c1(L)dim V =ZV
(V · Ldim V ) =ZV
(Rh + √−1∂∂ϕε)dim V
ε→0ZV
(Rh + √−1∂∂ϕε + εω)dim V > 0,

= lim

which is a result of Kleiman [41] (which however was used in [21] to show that
c1(L) is nef). Here the integrals of forms over V are really improper integrals
over the regular part of V , and the fact that these are ﬁnite, together with
the justiﬁcation of Stokes’ Theorem, is a classical result of Lelong (see e.g.
[34]).

Following Nakamaye [44] and Keel [40] we deﬁne the null locus of L to be

Null(L) = [(V ·Ldim V )=0

V,

where the union is over all irreducible positive-dimensional analytic subva-
rieties V ⊂ X with (V · Ldim V ) = 0. This is clearly a numerical invariant
of L, and it is in fact a closed analytic subvariety of X, although this is not
entirely obvious. Clearly, if L is ample then Null(L) = ∅, and the converse
is also true thanks to the Nakai-Moishezon ampleness criterion (see e.g. [42,
Theorem 1.2.23]).

We have that Null(L) 6= X iﬀ (X · Ln) > 0, and since L is nef, this is true
iﬀ L is big (using Riemann-Roch, see [42, Theorem 2.2.16]). More generally,
Null(L) is just the union of all irreducible subvarieties V such that L|V is
not big.
As we have just seen, Null(L) satisﬁes the same basic properties as B+(L),
and both measure the failure of ampleness of L. Nakamaye’s striking obser-
vation is that in fact these two loci coincide, and this is the content of:

10

3.2. Nakamaye’s Theorem.

Theorem 3.1 (Nakamaye [44]). Let X be a projective manifold and L a nef
and big line bundle over X. Then

B+(L) = Null(L).

Of course this theorem is still true if L is nef but not big, in which case

B+(L) = Null(L) = X.

Clearly Nakamaye’s Theorem also holds when L is replaced by a Q-divisor
In fact it also holds for nef R-divisors, as shown by Ein-Lazarsfeld-

D.
Mustat¸˘a-Nakamaye-Popa [29, Corollary 5.6].

There are many further generalizations of this theorem, including the case

of positive characteristic [13], the case when X is singular [9, 2].

We consider here its generalization to (1, 1) classes on complex manifolds.
Let [α] be a nef (1, 1) class on a compact complex manifold X.
If the
manifold is K¨ahler, and if V ⊂ X is any irreducible analytic subvariety then
the same argument as in (3.1) shows that

If the manifold is not K¨ahler, it is not clear whether (3.2) holds. But if we
assume that [α] is nef and big, then the existence of a big (1, 1) class implies
that X is in class C by [24, Theorem 3.4]. Furthermore, every irreducible
analytic subvariety V ⊂ X is in class C as well [32, Lemma 4.6]. Taking a
K¨ahler modiﬁcation of V we conclude as above that (3.2) holds.
Motivated by this, we deﬁne the null locus of a nef and big class [α] on a

compact complex manifold to be

Null(α) = [RV αdim V =0

V,

which is consistent with the algebraic deﬁnition if [α] = c1(L). The main
theorem of [16] is then the following:

Theorem 3.2 (Collins-T. [16]). Let X be a compact complex manifold and
[α] a nef and big (1, 1) class on X. Then

(3.3)

EnK(α) = Null(α).

Using Theorem 2.3, we immediately see that Theorem 3.2 implies Naka-
maye’s Theorem 3.1, and this gives a new, analytic proof of that result (as
well as its extension to R-divisors [29]).

4. Applications

In this section we give some applications of Theorem 3.2 to various related
topics. Further applications of Theorem 3.2 to the Minimal Model Program
for K¨ahler manifolds as well as to Zariski decompositions, we which did not
include for the sake of conciseness, can be found in [10, 12, 25, 39].

for all positive-dimensional irreducible analytic subvarieties V ⊂ X. Then
the K¨ahler cone of X is one of the connected components of P.

Furthermore, if X is a projective manifold, then it is not hard to see
that in fact the K¨ahler cone equals P. This is a vast generalization of the
Nakai-Moishezon ampleness criterion for line bundles (see e.g. [42, Theorem
1.2.23]).
Proof. Clearly every K¨ahler class is in P, and the K¨ahler cone is open and
convex, hence connected, and so it suﬃces to show that it is closed inside P.
It follows easily from the deﬁnition that (1, 1) classes in the closure of the
K¨ahler cone are nef (and conversely). Assume then that [α] is a nef (1, 1)
class which is also in P. In particular,

4.1. The Demailly-P˘aun Theorem.

Theorem 4.1 (Demailly-P˘aun [24]). Let X be a compact K¨ahler manifold,
and let P ⊂ H 1,1(X, R) be the cone of (1, 1) classes [α] which satisfy

ZV

αdim V > 0,

and so Theorem 2.1 shows that [α] is big, and by assumption Null(α) = ∅.
By Theorem 3.2 we have that EnK(α) = ∅, i.e.
[α] is a K¨ahler class, as
required.
(cid:3)

Note that Theorem 4.1 (or Theorem 3.2) also shows that if [α] is a nef
class on a compact K¨ahler manifold then Null(α) = ∅ iﬀ [α] is K¨ahler, a fact
that we will use later.
An extension of Theorem 4.1 to the case when X is a singular compact
K¨ahler analytic space, embedded in a smooth ambient manifold, was recently
obtained in [17], also as an application of Theorem 3.2.

4.2. The Fujita-Zariski Theorem. Following a strategy suggested by M.
P˘aun (which was communicated to the author by R. Lazarsfeld), we give an
analytic proof of a well-known theorem of Fujita [33, Theorem 1.10] (see also
[27] for another algebraic proof), and its extension to complex manifolds.

Theorem 4.2. Let X be a compact complex manifold and L a holomorphic
line bundle. If the restriction of L to its base locus Bs(L) is ample, then L
is semiample (i.e. Lm is base point free for some m > 1).

As an immediate corollary, we obtain a generalization of a classical theo-

rem of Zariski [64]:

Corollary 4.3. Let X be a compact complex manifold and L a holomorphic
line bundle. If the base locus of L is a ﬁnite set, then L is semiample.

Following the argument of [29, Proposition 1.1], we also obtain (compare

with Proposition 2.4):

Corollary 4.4. Let X be a compact complex manifold and D a Q-divisor.
Then the stable base locus B(D) does not have isolated points.

Proof. Let x be an isolated point of B(D), and choose m > 1 large so that
B(D) = Bs(mD) and mD is the divisor of a line bundle L. Take a resolution
µ : ˜X → X of Bs(L)\{x}, as a complex analytic subspace of X, so that
µ∗L = M + F with F eﬀective and with Bs(M ) = {µ−1(x)}. By Corollary
4.3, M is semiample so M ℓ is base point free for some ℓ > 1, which implies
that x is not in the base locus of ℓmD, a contradiction.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 4.2. Since we are trying to show that L is semiample, up
to replacing L with Lm for m large, we may assume that Bs(L) = B(L).
Our goal is to show by contradiction that B(L) = ∅. We can clearly assume
that B(L) 6= X.
Fix a smooth closed real (1, 1) form α on X in the class c1(L), which is
the curvature of a smooth Hermitian metric h on L. Write B(L) = ∪N
j=1Zj
for the decomposition into irreducible components. For each j, since L|Zj is
ample, by [24, Proposition 3.3 (i)] there exists an open neighborhood Uj of
Zj in X and a smooth real-valued function ϕj such that α+√−1∂∂ϕj > 0 on
Uj. Then the gluing lemma [47, Lemme, p.419] gives us a smooth function
j=1Uj (a neighborhood of B(L) in X) with α + √−1∂∂ϕ > 0 on
ϕ on U = ∪N
U .
Choose s1, . . . , sℓ ∈ H 0(X, L), such that {s1 = ··· = sℓ = 0} = B(L). Let

gmax(ϕ − A, ψ),

coincides with ψ in a neighborhood of ∂U and is smooth everywhere on U
(since it agrees with ϕ in a neighborhood of B(L)). Therefore if we let Ψ

c1(L) is nef), and since α + √−1∂∂Ψ > 0 at at least one point of X, it
follows from Siu [51] (see also [19]) that X is Moishezon (hence in class C)
and that L is big.
Let then x be any point in B(L), and V any irreducible positive-dimensional

subvariety of X which passes through x. Then

which is smooth near x. If µ : ˜X → X is a resolution of the singularities of
T , obtained as a composition of blowups with smooth centers, then ˜X is pro-
jective (see e.g. [24, Remark 3.6]) and µ is an isomorphism near x. Thanks
to Proposition 2.5, we have EnK(c1(µ∗L)) = µ−1(EnK (c1(L)))∪Exc(µ), and
so µ−1(x) 6∈ EnK(c1(µ∗L)). Since ˜X is projective, by Theorem 2.3 we have

EnK(c1(µ∗L)) = B+(µ∗L) ⊃ B(µ∗L),

and so µ−1(x) 6∈ B(µ∗L) and hence x 6∈ B(L), which is a contradiction.

4.3. A local ampleness criterion. The following is a transcendental gen-
eralization of a local ampleness criterion of Takayama [53, Proposition 2.1],
with the extra assumption that the class be nef:

Theorem 4.5. Let X be a compact complex manifold and [α] a nef and big
(1, 1) class. Let T > 0 be a closed positive current in the class α which is a
smooth K¨ahler metric on a nonempty open set U ⊂ X. Then we have that
U ∩ EnK(α) = ∅.

Such a result (in the projective case) was used to obtain quasi-projectivity

criteria in [43, Theorem 6.1] and [50, Theorem 6].
Proof. Given any x ∈ U let V be any irreducible subvariety of X which
passes through V , and say dim V = k. Let µ : ˜X → X be an embedded
resolution of singularities of V ⊂ X, so that µ is a composition of blowups
with smooth centers, it is an isomorphism at the generic point of V , and
the proper transform ˜V of V is smooth. The class µ∗[α] is nef and big and
satisﬁes

and by a theorem of by Boucksom [4, Theorem 4.1] this equals the volume
of the class [µ∗α| ˜V ], which is deﬁned as

(µ∗α)k,

ZV

αk =Z ˜V
S>0Z ˜V

ac,

where the supremum is over all closed positive currents S in this class, and
Sac denotes the absolutely continuous part of S (see [4] for details). Observe
that µ∗T is a closed positive current in the class µ∗[α] which is a smooth
semipositive (1, 1) form on the open set µ−1(U ), and in fact a K¨ahler metric
on the open subset µ−1(U )\Exc(µ). Therefore (µ∗T )| ˜V is a K¨ahler metric
on a nonempty open subset of ˜V (where of course it equals its absolutely
continuous part), and therefore

ZV

αk >Z ˜V

((µ∗T )| ˜V )k

Since V is arbitrary, we conclude that x 6∈ Null(α), and so it follows from
Theorem 3.2 that x 6∈ EnK(α), as required.

4.4. Seshadri constants. These were introduced by Demailly [22] to mea-
sure the local positivity of line bundles. Further properties of these invari-
ants can be found for example in [1, 22, 42].

Let [α] be a nef (1, 1) class on a compact K¨ahler manifold. We deﬁne its

Seshadri constant at a point x ∈ X to be

ε(α, x) = sup{λ > 0 | µ∗[α] − λ[E] is nef},

where µ : ˜X → X is the blowup of X at x, and E = µ−1(x) is the exceptional
divisor.
It is natural to ask what are the points x ∈ X where ε(α, x) vanishes.
This is answered by the following result, which also contains the extension
of [42, Proposition 5.1.9] in our transcendental situation:

Theorem 4.6. Let X be a compact K¨ahler manifold, [α] a nef (1, 1) class
and x ∈ X. Then we have
(4.2)
if and only if
and furthermore for all x ∈ X we have

x ∈ EnK(α) = Null(α),

ε(α, x) = 0

where the minimum runs over all positive-dimensional irreducible analytic
subvarieties V containing x, and multxV denotes the multiplicity of V at x.
Proof. First we show that for all x ∈ X we have

To this end, let V be any positive-dimensional irreducible subvariety through
x, let µ : ˜X → X be the blowup of x, let ˜V be the proper transform of V
through µ, and let k = dim V > 0. If λ > 0 is such that µ∗[α] − λ[E] is nef
then
0 6Z ˜V
αk − λkmultxV,
using the fact that multxV = −(−1)kR ˜V [E]k thanks to [42, Lemma 5.1.10].

This proves (4.4), which also clearly shows that if x ∈ Null(α) then ε(α, x) =
0.
Conversely if x 6∈ Null(α) = EnK (α) (using Theorem 3.2), then there is
a K¨ahler current T ∈ [α] with analytic singularities which is smooth near
x, and satisﬁes T = α + √−1∂∂ψ > δω on X for some δ > 0. Also,
since [α] is nef, for every ε > 0 there is a smooth function ρε such that
α + √−1∂∂ρε > −εω on X. Now since [E]|E ∼= OCPn−1(−1), there is a
smooth closed real (1, 1) form η on ˜X which is cohomologous to [E], is
supported on a neighborhood U of E, and such that µ∗ω − γη is a K¨ahler

ε > 0 choose a large constant Cε > 0 such that

[24, Lemma 3.5]). For every

˜ρε := gmax(ρε − Cε, ψ),

is a smooth function on X which agrees with ψ in a neighborhood of x which

contains µ(U ). We have α +√−1∂∂ ˜ρε > −εω on X and α +√−1∂∂ ˜ρε > δω

on µ(U ). Therefore on U we have

µ∗α − δγη + √−1∂∂(µ∗ ˜ρε) > 0,

while on ˜X\U we have
µ∗α − δγη + √−1∂∂(µ∗ ˜ρε) = µ∗α + √−1∂∂(µ∗ ˜ρε) > −εµ∗ω > −Cε˜ω,

where ˜ω is a ﬁxed K¨ahler metric on ˜X, with µ∗ω 6 C ˜ω. This shows that
µ∗[α] − δγ[E] is nef, and so ε(α, x) > γδ > 0. We obtain that (4.2) holds,
and therefore also (4.3) in the case when x ∈ Null(α).
It remains to show that (4.3) holds if x 6∈ Null(α), and so ε(α, x) > 0.
By deﬁnition we have that µ∗[α]− ε(α, x)[E] is nef but not K¨ahler (because
the K¨ahler cone is open), so by Theorem 4.1 there is a positive-dimensional
irreducible analytic subvariety ˜V ⊂ ˜X with

If ˜V ⊂ E then −[E]| ˜V ∼= OCPn−1(1)| ˜V which is ample, and so we would

a contradiction.

Therefore we must have that ˜V intersects E but is not contained in it, and
so V = µ(V ) is an irreducible k-dimensional subvariety of X which passes
through x and (4.5) gives

4.5. The K¨ahler-Ricci ﬂow. We brieﬂy discuss an application of Theorem
3.2 to the study of the K¨ahler-Ricci ﬂow (see for example [58] for a detailed
exposition). Let (X, ω0) be a compact K¨ahler manifold, and let ω(t) be a
family of K¨ahler metrics on X which solve the K¨ahler-Ricci ﬂow equation

(4.6)

∂
∂t

ω(t) = −Ric(ω(t)), ω(0) = ω0,

for t ∈ [0, T ), where 0 < T < ∞ is the maximal existence time, which we
assume is ﬁnite. Here Ric(ω(t)) is the Ricci curvature form of ω(t) which
equals Rh(t) where h(t) is the metric on K ∗
X induced by det g(t). It is known
that the maximal existence time T is ﬁnite if and only if c1(KX ) is not
nef [54, 62]. At time T a ﬁnite-time singularity forms, and the metrics
ω(t) cannot converge everywhere smoothly to a limiting K¨ahler metric on
X. The cohomology classes [ω(t)] however do converge to the limiting class
[α] = [ω0] + T c1(KX ), which is nef but not K¨ahler.

Deﬁne the singularity formation set Σ of this ﬂow to be equal to the

complement of

{x ∈ X | ∃U ∋ x open, ∃ωT K¨ahler metric on U s.t. ω(t)
A conjecture of Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf [31] states that Σ should be an
analytic subvariety of X. This was proved in [16], and more precisely we
have

→ ωT as t → T −}.

C∞(U )

Theorem 4.7 (Collins-T. [16]). For any ﬁnite-time singularity of the K¨ahler-
Ricci ﬂow we have that

In other words, Σ equals the union of all analytic subvarieties whose
volume shrinks to zero as t approaches T . In particular Σ = X happens
In this case, we expect that X admits a Fano
ﬁbration onto a lower-dimensional normal compact K¨ahler space Y , and
this was proved recently by Zhang and the author [61] when n 6 3.

if and only if RX αn = 0.

Theorem 3.2 is used crucially in the proof of Theorem 4.7 to produce
suitable barrier functions (with analytic singularities along Null(α)), which
are used to prove that the metrics ω(t) have a smooth limit on every compact
set in X\Null(α).
see e.g. [59, 60] and references therein.

The case when the maximal existence time T is inﬁnite is quite diﬀerent,

4.6. Degenerations of Calabi-Yau metrics. Let now X be a compact
K¨ahler manifold with c1(KX ) = 0 in H 1,1(X, R) (equivalently, KX is torsion
in Pic(X)). We will call such a manifold Calabi-Yau. By Yau’s Theorem
[63], every K¨ahler class on X contains a unique representative which is a
Ricci-ﬂat K¨ahler metric, i.e. a K¨ahler metric ω with Ric(ω) ≡ 0.
Let now [α] be nef and big, and let [αt] be a path of K¨ahler classes
(0 < t 6 1) which converge to [α] as t → 0. By Yau’s Theorem, for every
t > 0 there is a unique Ricci-ﬂat K¨ahler metric ωt in the class [αt], and the

NAKAMAYE’S THEOREM ON COMPLEX MANIFOLDS

17

question we would like to address is what is the behavior of these metrics
as t → 0.
Theorem 4.8. In this setup there is an incomplete Ricci-ﬂat K¨ahler metric
ω0 on X\Null(α) (which depends only on [α] and not on the path [αt]), such
that

ωt → ω0

as

t → 0,

smoothly on compact subsets of X\Null(α). Furthermore, (X, ωt) converge
in the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ topology (i.e. as metric spaces) to the metric com-
pletion of (X\Null(α), ω0).

Again Theorem 3.2 is used to construct barrier functions and prove es-
timates on the metrics ωt. Theorem 4.8 was proved in [16] building upon
earlier work in [55, 49, 30, 8]. When [α] is a rational class, it follows that
X is projective and the base-point-free theorem gives a birational morphism
f : X → Y onto a singular Calabi-Yau variety with at worst canonical sin-
gularities, with Exc(f ) = Null(α), and then ω0 can be thought of as the
pullback of a singular Ricci-ﬂat metric on Y as constructed in [30]. In this
case it follows from [52] (see also [26]) that the Gromov-Hausdorﬀ limit as
above is in fact homeomorphic to Y .

The case when [α] is nef but not big has also been widely studied, and
in this case (assuming that [α] is the pullback of a K¨ahler metric from the
base of a ﬁber space) the Ricci-ﬂat metrics collapse in the limit to a lower-
dimensional space, see [37, 56, 35, 36, 38, 59].

5. Ideas from the proof

In this section we describe the proof of Theorem 3.2. The easy part is

showing that

Null(α) ⊂ EnK (α).

This was observed already in [11, Theorem 2.2], which we roughly follow
here. If this was not the case, we could ﬁnd a point x ∈ Null(α) which is not
in EnK(α), and so there is a K¨ahler current T = α + √−1∂∂ψ > δω on X,
(δ > 0) with analytic singularities, and which is smooth near x. Let V be
any positive-dimensional irreducible analytic subvariety of X which passes
through x, and let k = dim V . As explained in subsection 3.2, since X is
in class C, so is V , and so we can take a resolution µ : ˜V → V obtained
as a composition of blowups with smooth centers, where ˜V is a compact
K¨ahler manifold. Furthermore, regarding the ﬁrst center of blowups as a
submanifold of X, blowing it up inside X and repeating, we obtain an
extension of the map µ to µ : ˜X → X where ˜X is a compact complex
manifold which contains ˜V as a submanifold. From this it is clear that
µ∗α| ˜V deﬁnes a smooth closed real (1, 1) form on ˜V , whose class [µ∗α| ˜V ] is
nef, and so for every ε > 0 we can ﬁnd a smooth function ϕε on ˜V such
that µ∗α| ˜V + √−1∂∂ϕε > −ε˜ω on ˜V , where ˜ω is a K¨ahler metric on ˜V .

Also, the current µ∗T can be restricted to ˜V , and exactly as in (2.1) we

18

VALENTINO TOSATTI

obtain an L1 usc function ψ′ on ˜X (not identically −∞ on ˜V ) such that
T ′ := µ∗T + √−1∂∂ψ′ is a K¨ahler current on ˜X, and it satisﬁes T ′| ˜V
> δ′ ˜ω
for some δ′ > 0. Then we have
(µ∗α + ε˜ω)k =Z ˜V

for any closed smooth real (n − 1, n − 1) form γ. Iterating this argument,
we obtain

(µ∗α + ε˜ω)k > δ′kZ ˜V

and letting ε → 0 we ﬁnally get

ZV

αk =Z ˜V

(µ∗α)k = lim

using that

and since V was arbitrary this shows that x 6∈ Null(α), a contradiction.

The reverse inclusion

is much harder to prove, and we will give an outline of the argument, refer-
ring to [16] for full details.

EnK(α) ⊂ Null(α),

We again argue by contradiction, so suppose we had a point x ∈ EnK(α)
which is not in Null(α). Let V be an irreducible component of EnK(α) that
passes through x. Thanks to Proposition 2.4, V is a positive-dimensional ir-
reducible analytic subvariety, say dim V = k. Using an embedded resolution
of singularities, it is not hard to see [16, p.1180] that we can assume without
loss of generality that V is smooth, so it is a compact complex manifold, in
class C. The class [α|V ] is nef, and since x 6∈ Null(α) it satisﬁes

˜ωk,

˜ωk > 0,

ZV

αk > 0.

Therefore [α|V ] is big by Theorem 2.1, and so it contains a K¨ahler current
T = α|V +√−1∂∂ϕ > δω|V , δ > 0, where we may assume that the function
ϕ on V has analytic singularities deﬁned by a coherent ideal sheaf I on V .
By Theorem 2.2 we also have a K¨ahler current K = α + √−1∂∂ψ on X,
with analytic singularities along EnK (α), so in particular ψ|V ≡ −∞.
current ˜T = α + √−1∂∂ ˜ϕ on X in the class [α] such that ˜ϕ|V is smooth on

The goal now is to use T , together with K, to produce a global K¨ahler

NAKAMAYE’S THEOREM ON COMPLEX MANIFOLDS

19

a Zariski open subset of V . This is exactly the content of [16, Theorem 3.2].
Once we achieve this, it follows that applying Demailly’s regularization [20]
to ˜T produces a K¨ahler current with analytic singularities which is smooth
at the generic point of V , contradicting the fact that V is a component of
EnK(α).

For the sake of clarity, let us ﬁrst see how to construct ˜T in the case when
n = 2. In this case V is a compact Riemann surface, and [α|V ] is nef and
big, which in fact implies that [α|V ] is a K¨ahler class. Indeed EnK(α|V ) is
an analytic subvariety of V , hence a ﬁnite set of points, but we know from
Proposition 2.4 that there cannot be any such points. We then choose ω
a K¨ahler metric on V in the class [α|V ], which will now play the role of
the K¨ahler current T above. Since V is a smooth submanifold of X it is
elementary to ﬁnd an extension of ω, still denoted by ω, to a K¨ahler form
on a neighborhood U of V in X, which is of the form ω = α + √−1∂∂ρ on
U , for a smooth function ρ. Since the global function ψ equals −∞ on V ,
there is a large constant C such that ρ − C < ψ in a neighborhood of ∂U .
We can then set

and we have that ˜ϕ is now globally deﬁned, satisﬁes that ˜T = α+√−1∂∂ ˜ϕ is
a K¨ahler current on X, and ˜ϕ|V equals ρ|V which is smooth. This completes
the proof when n = 2.
It should be now clear what the diﬃculties are in extending this argument
when n > 2. The K¨ahler current T that we have produced on V will in
general have singularities, and it is not clear anymore how to produce an
extension to a neighborhood U of V in X. Furthermore, even if we could
produce this extension, it would still have singularities and so the simple
gluing in (5.1) would not work to produce a global K¨ahler current.

To deal with the extension problem, the ﬁrst observation is that in fact
it is enough to achieve an extension on some bimeromorphic model of X
(which roughly speaking corresponds to ﬁnding an extension to a “pinched
neighborhood” of V inside X, cf. the discussion in [15]). This is because if
µ : ˜X → X is a sequence of smooth blowups, which is an isomorphism at
the generic point of V , then if we can achieve our extension and gluing goal
on ˜X, we can then simply push forward the resulting K¨ahler current from
˜X to X.

The advantage of working on a blowup is that, by resolving the ideal
sheaf I deﬁning the singularities of the K¨ahler current T on V , we obtain a
modiﬁcation µ : ˜X → X as above, such that µ∗T has analytic singularities
described by E ∩ ˜V , where ˜V is the proper transform of V and E is an
eﬀective R-divisor on ˜X whose support has simple normal crossings, and
also has normal crossings with ˜V . Explicitly, this means that there is an
open cover {Wj}16j6N of ˜V by coordinate charts for ˜X, such that on each Wj
there are coordinates (z1, . . . , zn) such that ˜V ∩Wj = {z1 = ··· = zn−k = 0},

and with Supp(E) ∩ Wj = {zi1 ··· zip = 0}, where n − k < i1, . . . , ip 6 n,
and on ˜V ∩ Wj we have

(5.2)

µ∗ϕ = c log Yk

|zik|2αik! + hj ,

where c, αik ∈ R>0, and hj is a continuous function on Wj. As in (2.1), after
adding a small correction term to µ∗ϕ, which is singular only along E ∩ ˜V ,
we obtain a function ϕ′ with analytic singularities so that µ∗α + √−1∂∂ϕ′
deﬁnes a K¨ahler current on ˜V . If on Wj we write z = (z1, . . . , zn−k), z′ =
(zn−k+1, . . . , zn), then we can extend ϕ′ to a function ϕj on Wj by setting

ϕj(z, z′) = ϕ′(0, z′) + A|z|2,

analytic singularities).

Next, we would like to patch together these functions ϕj to a function

for A > 0 large, so that µ∗α + √−1∂∂ϕj is a K¨ahler current on Wj (with
deﬁned on U :=Sj Wj, which is an open neighborhood of ˜V . If the functions

ϕj were continuous, this would follow immediately from a well-known gluing
procedure of Richberg [48]. The key point is that on each nontrivial overlap
Wj ∩ Wk the diﬀerence ϕj − ϕk is in fact continuous, because the analytic
singularities of both ϕj and ϕk are of exactly the same type, along the
divisor E ∩ Wj ∩ Wk, as in (5.2). This is all that is needed for the Richberg
gluing argument to go through, and we thus obtain a function ρ on U , with
analytic singularities described by E ∩ U , such that µ∗α + √−1∂∂ρ is a
of X, we proceed to the gluing step. The pullback µ∗K = µ∗α+√−1∂∂(µ∗ψ)
only along E) so that we obtain a global K¨ahler current µ∗α + √−1∂∂ψ′ >
δ′ ˜ω on ˜X, with analytic singularities along µ−1(EnK(α)) ∪ Exc(µ) ⊃ ˜V . In
order for ψ′ to glue to ρ, we ﬁrst add a small correction term to ρ, which
is singular along the closure of µ−1(EnK (α))\ ˜V , to obtain a K¨ahler current
µ∗α + √−1∂∂ρ′ on U with analytic singularities wherever ψ′ is singular,
except along ˜V .
on ˜X such that µ∗α + √−1∂∂ϕε > −εδ′ ˜ω, so that

Since the class [µ∗α] is nef, for every ε > 0 there is a smooth function ϕε

can also be modiﬁed by adding a small correction term to it (which is singular

K¨ahler current on U .

Now that we have achieved our desired extension, albeit on some blowup

µ∗α + √−1∂∂(cid:0)εψ′ + (1 − ε)ϕε(cid:1) > ε2δ′ ˜ω > 0,
is still a K¨ahler current, whose singularities have been attenuated. Choosing
ε > 0 suﬃciently small, it is not hard to show that there are a neighborhood
˜U of ˜V in ˜X, with ˜U ⊂ U , and a constant C > 0 such that

εψ′ + (1 − ε)ϕε > ρ′ − C,

NAKAMAYE’S THEOREM ON COMPLEX MANIFOLDS

on a neighborhood of ∂ ˜U . We can then set

(5.3)

˜ϕ =(cid:26) max(ρ′ − C, εψ′ + (1 − ε)ϕε),

εψ′ + (1 − ε)ϕε

on ˜U
on ˜X\ ˜U ,

and we have that ˜ϕ is now globally deﬁned, satisﬁes that ˜T = µ∗α+√−1∂∂ ˜ϕ
is a K¨ahler current on ˜X, and ˜ϕ| ˜V equals ρ′| ˜V − C which is smooth at the
generic point of ˜V . This completes the proof of Theorem 3.2.

We conclude this article by noting that a reﬁnement of the extension and
gluing techniques that we just presented allowed Collins and the author [15]
to prove the following extension theorem for K¨ahler currents:
Theorem 5.1. Let (X, ω) be a compact K¨ahler manifold and V ⊂ X a
submanifold. If T is a K¨ahler current on V with analytic singularities in
the class [ω|V ] then T extends to a global K¨ahler current on X in the class
[ω].

It is expected that this extension result should hold more generally when
V is an analytic subvariety and T is just a closed positive current in the class
[ω|V ] (in which case T should extend to a global closed positive current).
This was proved by Coman-Guedj-Zeriahi [18] when X is projective and [ω]
is a rational class, using rather diﬀerent techniques.
