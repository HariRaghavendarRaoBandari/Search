Abstract

We prove the isoperimetric Euler–Lagrange and DuBois–Reymond type optimality condi-
tions and we obtain a nonsmooth extension of Noether’s symmetry theorem for isoperimetric
variational problems with delayed arguments. The result is proved to be valid in the class
of Lipschitz functions, as long as the delayed isoperimetric Euler–Lagrange extremals are
restricted to those that satisfy the isoperimetric DuBois–Reymond necessary optimality con-
dition. The important case of delayed optimal control problems is considered as well.

Introduction

The concept of symmetry plays an important role in science and engineering. Symmetries are de-
scribed by transformations, which result in the same object after the transformations are carried
out. They are described mathematically by parameter groups of transformations [13, 21]. Their
importance, as recognized by Noether in 1918 [24], is connected with the existence of conserva-
tion laws that can be used to reduce the order of the Euler–Lagrange diﬀerential equations [9].
Noether’s symmetry theorem is nowadays recognized as one of the most beautiful results of the
calculus of variations and optimal control [5,20], and becomes one of the most important theorems
for physics in the 20th century. Since the seminal work of Emmy Noether it is well know that all
conservations laws in mechanics, e.g., conservation of energy or conservation of momentum, are
directly related to the invariance of the action under a family of transformations.

Within the years, this theorem has been studied by many authors and generalized in diﬀerent
directions: see [1, 6–8, 15, 22, 23, 27] and references therein. In particular, in a recent paper [10],
Noether’s theorem was formulated for variational problems with delayed arguments. The result is
important because problems with delays play a crucial role in the modeling of real-life phenomena
in various ﬁelds of applications [4, 12, 14]. In order to prove Noether’s theorem with delays, it was

assumed that admissible functions are C2-smooth and that Noether’s conserved quantity holds
along all C2-extremals of the Euler–Lagrange equations with time delay [10].

One of the oldest and interesting class of variational problems, with applications in several
ﬁelds, are the isoperimetric problems [30].
Isoperimetric in mathematical physics has roots in
the Queen Dido problem of the calculus of variations, and has recently been subject to several
investigations. Here we extent the Noether’s theorem with delays for variational problems.

The text is organized as follows. In Section 2 the fundamental problem of variational calculus
with delayed arguments is formulated and a short review of the results for C2-smooth admissible
functions is given. The main contributions of the paper appear in Sections 3: we prove the isoperi-
metric Euler–Lagrange and DuBois–Reymond type optimality conditions (Theorem 10 and The-
orem 14, respectively), an isoperimetric Noether symmetry theorem with time delay for Lipschitz
functions (Theorem 18) and an isoperimetric weak Pontryagin maximum principle (Theorem 23).

2 Preliminaries

In this section we review some necessary results on the calculus of variations with time delay. For
more on variational problems with delayed arguments we refer the reader to [2, 3, 14, 16, 18, 19, 26].

The fundamental problem consists of minimizing a functional

J τ [q(·)] =Z t2

t1

L (t, q(t), ˙q(t), q(t − τ ), ˙q(t − τ )) dt

subject to boundary conditions

q(t) = δ(t) for t ∈ [t1 − τ, t1] and q(t2) = qt2 .

(1)

(2)

We assume that the Lagrangian L : [t1, t2] × R4 → R, is a C2-function with respect to all its
arguments, the admissible functions q(·) are C2-smooth, t1 < t2 are ﬁxed in R, τ is a given positive
real number such that τ < t2 − t1, and δ is a given piecewise smooth function on [t1 − τ, t1].
Throughout the text, ∂iL denotes the partial derivative of L with respect to its ith argument,
i = 1, . . . , 5. For convenience of notation, we introduce the operator [·]τ deﬁned by

[q]τ (t) = (t, q(t), ˙q(t), q(t − τ ), ˙q(t − τ )).

The next theorem gives a necessary optimality condition of Euler–Lagrange type for (1)–(2).
Theorem 1 (Euler–Lagrange equations with time delay [16]). If q(·) ∈ C2 is a minimizer for
problem (1)–(2), then q(·) satisﬁes the following Euler–Lagrange equations with time delay:

( d

dt {∂3L[q]τ (t) + ∂5L[q]τ (t + τ )} = ∂2L[q]τ (t) + ∂4L[q]τ (t + τ ),
d
dt ∂3L[q]τ (t) = ∂2L[q]τ (t),

t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2.

t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ,

(3)

Deﬁnition 2 (Extremals). The solutions q(·) of the Euler–Lagrange equations (3) with time delay
are called extremals.

Deﬁnition 3 (Invariance of (1)). Consider the following s-parameter group of inﬁnitesimal trans-
formations:

(¯t = t + sη(t, q) + o(s) ,

¯q(t) = q(t) + sξ(t, q) + o(s),

(4)

where η ∈ C1(R2) and ξ ∈ C1(R2). Functional (1) is said to be invariant under (4) if

,

q(t − τ ) + sξ(t − τ, q(t − τ )) + o(s),

for any subinterval I ⊆ [t1, t2].

˙q(t − τ ) + s ˙ξ(t − τ, q(t − τ ))

1 + s ˙η(t − τ, q(t − τ )) ! (1 + s ˙η(t, q(t)))dt(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s=0

Deﬁnition 4 (Constant of motion/conservation law with time delay). We say that a quantity
C(t, t + τ, q(t), q(t − τ ), q(t + τ ), ˙q(t), ˙q(t − τ ), ˙q(t + τ )) is a constant of motion with time delay τ if

d
dt

C(t, t + τ, q(t), q(t − τ ), q(t + τ ), ˙q(t), ˙q(t − τ ), ˙q(t + τ )) = 0

(5)

along all the extremals q(·) (cf. Deﬁnition 2). The equality (5) is then a conservation law with
time delay.

Next theorem extends the DuBois–Reymond necessary optimality condition to problems of the

calculus of variations with time delay.

Theorem 5 (DuBois–Reymond necessary conditions with time delay [10]). If q(·) ∈ C2 is an
extremal of functional (1) subject to (2) such that

∂4L[q]τ (t + τ ) · ˙q(t) + ∂5L[q]τ (t + τ ) · ¨q(t) = 0

for all t ∈ [t1 − τ, t2 − τ ], then it satisﬁes the following conditions:

( d

dt {L[q]τ (t) − ˙q(t) · (∂3L[q]τ (t) + ∂5L[q]τ (t + τ ))} = ∂1L[q]τ (t),
d
t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2 .
dt {L[q]τ (t) − ˙q(t) · ∂3L[q]τ (t)} = ∂1L[q]τ (t),

t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ,

(6)

Remark 6. If we assume that admissible functions in problem (1)–(2) are Lipschitz continuous,
then one can show that the DuBois–Reymond necessary conditions with time delay (21) are still
valid (cf. [11]).

Theorem 7 establishes an extension of Noether’s theorem to problems of the calculus of varia-

tions with time delay.

Theorem 7 (Noether’s symmetry theorem with time delay [10]). If functional (1) is invariant
in the sense of Deﬁnition 3 such that

∂4L[q]τ (t + τ ) · ˙q(t) + ∂5L[q]τ (t + τ ) · ¨q(t) = 0

and , then the quantity C(t, t + τ, q(t), q(t − τ ), q(t + τ ), ˙q(t), ˙q(t − τ ), ˙q(t + τ )) deﬁned by

(∂3L[q]τ (t) + ∂5L[q]τ (t + τ )) · ξ(t, q(t))

for t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ and by

+(cid:16)L[q]τ (t) − ˙q(t) · (∂3L[q]τ (t) + ∂5L[q]τ (t + τ ))(cid:17)η(t, q(t))

∂3L[q]τ (t) · ξ(t, q(t)) +(cid:16)L[q]τ (t) − ˙q(t) · ∂3L[q]τ (t)(cid:17)η(t, q(t))

for t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2 , is a constant of motion with time delay (cf. Deﬁnition 4).

3 Main results

We prove some important results for isoperimetric variational problems with time delay: a gener-
alized isoperimetric Euler–Lagrange necessary optimality condition (Theorem 10), a isoperimetric
DuBois–Reymond necessary optimality condition (Theorem 14) and a Noether’s ﬁrst theorem
for isoperimetric variational problems with time delay (Theorem 18).
In section 3.4 we adopt
the Hamiltonian formalism to prove the weak Pontryagin maximum principle for more general
isoperimetric action-like optimal control problems.

3.1

Isoperimetric Euler–Lagrange equations with time delay

We begin by deﬁning the isoperimetric variational problem under consideration.

Problem 1. (The isoperimetric variational problem with time delay) The isoperimetric problem
of the calculus of variations consists to ﬁnd the stationary functions of the functional (1), subject
to isoperimetric equality constraints

I τ [q(·)] =Z t2

t1

g[q]τ (t)dt = l,

l ∈ Rk ,

(9)

and boundary conditions (2).

We assume that l is a speciﬁed real constant and (t, s, y, u, v) 7→ g(t, s, y, u, v) are assumed to

be functions of class C2.

Theorem 1 motivates the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 8. An admissible function q(·) ∈ C2 is an extremal for problem (9)–(2) if it satisﬁes
the following Euler–Lagrange equations with time delay:

( d

dt {∂3g[q]τ (t) + ∂5g[q]τ (t + τ )} = ∂2g[q]τ (t) + ∂4g[q]τ (t + τ ),
d
dt ∂3g[q]τ (t) = ∂2g[q]τ (t),

t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2.

t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ,

(10)

The arguments of the calculus of variations assert that by using the Lagrange multiplier rule,

Problem 1 is equivalent to the following augmented problem [13, §12.1]: to minimize

F [q, λ]τ (t)dt

t1

J τ [q(·), λ] =Z t2
:=Z t2

t1

[L[q]τ (t) − λ · g[q]τ (t)] dt

subject to (2), where [q, λ]τ (t) = (t, q(t), ˙q(t), q(t − τ ), ˙q(t − τ ), λ).

The augmented Lagrangian

F := L − λ · g,

λ ∈ Rk, has an important role in our study.

(11)

(12)

The notion of extremizer (a local minimizer or a local maximizer) can be found in [13]. Ex-

tremizers can be classiﬁed as normal or abnormal.

Deﬁnition 9. An extremizer of Problem 1 that does not satisfy (10) is said to be a normal
extremizer; otherwise (i.e., if it satisﬁes (10) for all t ∈ [t1, t2]), is said to be abnormal.

The following theorem gives a necessary condition for q(·) to be a solution of Problem 1 under

the assumption that q(·) is a normal extremizer.

Theorem 10. If q(·) ∈ C2 ([t1 − τ, t2]) is a normal extremizer to Problem 1, then it satisﬁes the
following isoperimetric Euler–Lagrange equation with time delay:

d
dt {∂3F [q, λ]τ (t) + ∂5F [q, λ]τ (t + τ )}
= ∂2F [q, λ]τ (t) + ∂4F [q, λ]τ (t + τ ),
d
dt ∂3F [q, λ]τ (t) = ∂2F [q, λ]τ (t),

t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2 ,

t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ,

(13)

t ∈ [t1, t2], where F is the augmented Lagrangian (12) associated with Problem 1.

Proof. Consider neighboring functions of the form

ˆq(t) = q(t) + ǫ1h1(t) + ǫ2h2(t),

(14)

where for each i ∈ {1, 2} ǫi is a suﬃciently small parameter, hi are assumed to be functions of
class C2 ([t1 − τ, t2]), hi(t) = 0 for t ∈ [t1 − τ, t1] and hi(t2) = hi(t2 − τ ) = 0.

First we will show that (14) has a subset of admissible functions for the variational isoperimetric

problem with time delay. Consider the quantity

I τ [ˆq(·)] =Z t2

t1

g(t, ˆq(t), ˙ˆq(t), ˆq(t − τ ), ˙ˆq(t − τ ))dt.

Then we can regard I τ [ˆq(·)] as a function of ǫ1 and ǫ2. Deﬁne ˆI(ǫ1, ǫ2) = I τ [ˆq(·)] − l. Thus,

ˆI(0, 0) = 0.

(15)

On the other hand, we have

∂ ˆI

∂ǫ2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(0,0)

=Z t2
t1 h∂2g[q]τ (t) · h2(t) + ∂3g[q]τ (t) · ˙h2(t)i dt
+Z t2
t1 h∂4g[q]τ (t) · h2(t − τ ) + ∂5g[q]τ (t) · ˙h2(t − τ )i dt .

Using the change of variable t = s + τ in the second integral and recalling that h2 is null in

[t1 − τ, t1], we obtain that

∂ ˆI

∂ǫ2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(0,0)

h∂4g[q]τ (t + τ ) · h2(t) + ∂5g[q]τ (t + τ ) · ˙h2(t)i dt .

(16)

Applying integration by parts and since equation (16) holds for all admissible variations h2

such that h2 = 0 for all t ∈ [t2 − τ, t2] , we get

∂ ˆI

∂ǫ2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(0,0)

Now, if we restrict ourselves to those admissible variations h2 such that h2 = 0 for all t ∈

[t1, t2 − τ ] , we obtain

=Z t2

∂ ˆI

∂ǫ2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(0,0)

Since q(·) is not a extremal for problem (9)–(2), by the fundamental lemma of the calculus of

variations (see, e.g., [30]), there exists a function h2 such that

6= 0.

(17)

Using (15) and (17), the implicit function theorem asserts that there exists a function ǫ2(·), deﬁned
in a neighborhood of zero, such that ˆI(ǫ1, ǫ2(ǫ1)) = 0. Consider the real function ˆJ(ǫ1, ǫ2) =
J τ [ˆq(·)]. By hypothesis, ˆJ has minimum (or maximum) at (0, 0) subject to the constraint ˆI(0, 0) =

∂ ˆI

0, and we have proved that ∇ ˆI(0, 0) 6= 0. Then, we can appeal to the Lagrange multiplier rule
(see, e.g., [30, p. 77]) to assert the existence of a number λ such that ∇( ˆJ (0, 0) − λ · ˆI(0, 0)) = 0.

(19)

Since equations (18) and (19) hold for any function h1, from the fundamental lemma of the

calculus of variations (see, e.g., [12]), we obtain equations (13).

Remark 11. If one extends the set of admissible functions in Problem 1 to the class of Lipschitz
continuous functions, then the Euler–Lagrange equations (13) remain valid (cf. [11]).

Deﬁnition 12 (Isoperimetrc extremals with time delay). The solutions q(·) ∈ C2 ([t1 − τ, t2]) of
the Euler–Lagrange equations (13) are called isoperimetric extremals with time delay.

Remark 13. Note that if there is no time delay, that is, if τ = 0, then Problem 1 reduces to the
classical isoperimetric variational problem:

3.2 The DuBois-Reymond necessary condition

The following theorem gives a generalization of the DuBois–Reymond necessary condition for
classical variational problems [4] and generalizes the Dubois–Reymond necessary condition for
isoperimetric variational problems with time delay of [11].

Theorem 14 (Isoperimetric DuBois–Reymond necessary condition with time delay). If q(·) is an
isoperimetric extremals with time delay such that

∂4F [q]τ (t + τ ) · ˙q(t) + ∂5F [q]τ (t + τ ) · ¨q(t) = 0

for all t ∈ [t1 − τ, t2 − τ ], then it satisﬁes the following conditions:

d
dt

{F [q]τ (t) − ˙q(t) · (∂3F [q]τ (t) + ∂5F [q]τ (t + τ ))} = ∂1F [q]τ (t)

for t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ , and

d
dt

{F [q]τ (t) − ˙q(t) · ∂3F [q]τ (t)} = ∂1F [q]τ (t)

(20)

(21)

(22)

for t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2, where F is deﬁned in (12).

Proof. We only prove the theorem in the interval t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ (the proof is similar in the
interval t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2). We derive equation (21) as follows:

Let an arbitrary x ∈ [t1, t2 − τ ] . Note that

Z x

[F [q]τ (t) − ˙q(t) · (∂3F [q]τ (t) + ∂5F [q]τ (t + τ ))] dt

− ∂5 (L[q]τ (t + τ ) + λ · g[q]τ (t + τ )) · ¨q(t)

{∂3 (L[q]τ (t) + λ · g[q]τ (t)) + ∂5 (L[q]τ (t + τ ) + λ · g[q]τ (t + τ ))} · ˙q(t)idt

(23)

−

d
dt

+Z x

t1

+∂5 (L[q]τ (t) + λ · g[q]τ (t)) · ¨q(t − τ )] dt.

Observe that, by hypothesis (20), the last integral of (23) is null and by substituting the Euler–
Lagrange equation with time delay (13), the equation (23) becomes

[F [q]τ (t) − ˙q(t) · (∂3F [q]τ (t) + ∂5F [q]τ (t + τ ))] dt

t1 (cid:16)∂1 (L[q]τ (t) + λ · g[q]τ (t))

=Z x
− [∂4 (L[q]τ (t) + λ · g[q]τ (t)) · ˙q(t) + ∂5 (L[q]τ (t + τ ) + λ · g[q]τ (t + τ )) · ¨q(t)](cid:17)dt.

Using hypothesis (20) in the right hand side of the last equation, we conclude that

(24)

We ﬁnally obtain (21) by the arbitrariness x ∈ [t1, t2 − τ ] .

Remark 15. If we assume that admissible functions in Problem 1 are Lipschitz continuous, then
one can show that the DuBois–Reymond necessary conditions with time delay (21)–(22) are still
valid (cf. [11]).

3.3 Variational isoperimetric Noether’s conservation laws with time de-

lay

In [11] the authors remark that when one extends Noether’s theorem to the biggest class for which
one can derive the Euler–Lagrange equations, i.e., for Lipschitz continuous functions, then one
can ﬁnd Lipschitz Euler–Lagrange extremals that fail to satisfy the Noether conserved quantity
established in [10]. They show that to formulate Noether’s theorem with time delays for nonsmooth
functions, it is enough to restrict the set of delayed Euler–Lagrange extremals to those that satisfy
the delayed DuBois–Reymond condition.

The notion of invariance given in Deﬁnition 3 can be extended up to an exact diﬀerential.

Deﬁnition 16 (Invariance up to a gauge-term). We say that functional (11) is invariant under
the s-parameter group of inﬁnitesimal transformations (4) up to the gauge-term Φ if

(11) is invariant up to Φ in the sense of Deﬁnition 16 such that satisfy the condition (20), then

satisfying both (13) and (21)-(22), i.e., along any Lipschitz Euler–Lagrange extremal that is also
a Lipschitz DuBois–Reymond extremal.

Proof. We prove the theorem in the interval t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ . The proof is similar for the interval
t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2. Noether’s constant of motion with time delay (30) follows by using in the interval
t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ the DuBois–Reymond condition with time delay (21) and the Euler–Lagrange
equation with time delay (13) into the necessary condition of invariance (26):

given as

F = ( ˙q(t) + ˙q(t − τ ))3 − λ ( ˙q + ˙q(t − 1))2 .

From Theorem 10 (see Remark 11), one obtains that any solution to problem (33)-(34) must satisfy

3h( ˙q + ˙q(t − 1))2 + ( ˙q(t + 1) + ˙q(t))2i − 2λ (2 ˙q(t) + ˙q(t − 1) + ˙q(t + 1)) = c1,

3 ( ˙q + ˙q(t − 1))2 − 2λ ( ˙q(t) + ˙q(t − 1)) = c2,

(37)
where c1 and c2 are constants. Because problem (33)–(34) is autonomous, we have invariance,
in the sense of Deﬁnition 16, with η ≡ 1 and ξ ≡ 0. Simple calculations show that isoperimet-
ric Noether’s constant of motion with time delay (30)–(31) coincides with the DuBois–Reymond
condition (21)–(22):

Isoperimetric optimal control with time delay

Theorem 18 gives a Lagrangian formulation of isoperimetric Noether’s principle to the time delay
setting. Now we give a Hamiltonian formulation to prove an isoperimetric weak Pontryagin max-
imum principle for the more general isoperimetric problems of optimal control with time delay
(Theorem 23).

The isoperimetric optimal control problem with time delay is deﬁned in Lagrange form as

follows: to minimize

I τ [q(·), u(·)] =Z t2

t1

L (t, q(t), u(t), q(t − τ ), u(t − τ )) dt

and initial condition

g (t, q(t), u(t), q(t − τ ), u(t − τ )) dt = l, l ∈ k

(41)

(42)

(43)

q(t) = δ(t),

(44)
where q(·) ∈ C1 ([t1 − τ, t2]), u(·) ∈ C0 ([t1 − τ, t2]), the funcions L, g : [t1, t2]× R4 and the velocity
vector ϕ : [t1, t2] × R4 → R are assumed to be C1-functions with respect to all their arguments,
t1 < t2 are ﬁxed in R, and τ is a given positive real number such that τ < t2 − t1. As before, we
assume that δ is a given piecewise smooth function.

t ∈ [t1 − τ, t1],

Remark 20. In the particular case when ϕ(t, q, u, qτ , uτ ) = u, problem (41)–(44) is reduced to
the Problem 1.

Notation. We introduce the operators [·, ·]τ and [·, ·, ·]τ deﬁned by

where q(·) ∈ C1 ([t1 − τ, t2]) and u(·) ∈ C0 ([t1 − τ, t2]); and

[q, u]τ (t) = (t, q(t), u(t), q(t − τ ), u(t − τ )) ,

[q, u, p, λ]τ (t) = (t, q(t), u(t), q(t − τ ), u(t − τ ), p(t), λ) ,

where q(·) ∈ C1 ([t1 − τ, t2]), p(·) ∈ C1 ([t1, t2]), u(·) ∈ C0 ([t1 − τ, t2]) and λ ∈ R.

Deﬁnition 21. The delayed diﬀerential control system (42) is called an isoperimetric control
system with time delay.

Deﬁnition 22. (Isoperimetric process with time delay) An admissible pair (q(·), u(·)) that sat-
isﬁes the isoperimetric control system (42) and the isoperimetric constraints (43) is said to be a
isoperimetric process with time delay.

Theorem 23. (Isoperimetric Weak Pontryagin maximum principle) If (q(·), u(·)) is a minimizer
of (41)–(44), then there exists a covector function p(·) ∈ C1 ([t1, t2]) such that for all t ∈ [t1 − τ, t2]
the following conditions hold:

• the isoperimetric Hamiltonian systems with time delay

( ˙q(t) = ∂6H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t)

˙p(t) = −∂2H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t) − ∂4H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t + τ )

for t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ , and

for t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2;

( ˙q(t) = ∂6H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t)

˙p(t) = −∂2H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t)

11

(45)

(46)

• the isoperimetric stationary conditions with time delay

∂3H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t) + ∂5H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t + τ ) = 0

for t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ , and

for t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2,

∂3H[q, u, p]τ (t) = 0

where the isoperimetric Hamiltonian H is deﬁned by

(47)

(48)

H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t) = L[q, u]τ (t) − λ · g[q, u]τ (t) + p(t) · ϕ[q, u]τ (t).

(49)

Proof. We prove the theorem only in the interval t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ (the reasoning is similar in the
interval t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2). Minimizing (41) subject to (42)–(44) is equivalent, by the Lagrange
multiplier rule, to minimize

I τ [q(·), u(·), p(·), λ] =Z t2

t1

[H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t) − p(t) · ˙q(t)] dt

(50)

with H given by (49). Theorem 23 follows by applying the isoperimetric Euler–Lagrange optimality
condition (13) to the equivalent functional (50):

d
dt (L ˙q[q, u, p, λ]τ (t) + L ˙qτ [q, u, p, λ]τ (t + τ ))

0 = − ˙q(t) + ∂6H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t),

⇔ 


where L[q, u, p, λ]τ (t) = H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t) − p(t) · ˙q(t) , Lζ denotes the partial derivative of L with
respect to ζ argument and ζτ = ζ(t − τ ) .

Deﬁnition 24. A triplet (q(·), u(·), p(·)) satisfying the conditions of Theorem 23 is called an
isopereimetric Pontryagin extremal with time delay.

Remark 25. The ﬁrst equation in the Hamiltonian system (45) and (46) is nothing but the control
system with time delay ˙q(t) = ϕ[q, u]τ (t) given by (42).

Remark 26. In classical mechanics, p is called the generalized momentum. In the language of
optimal control [25], p is known as the adjoint variable.

Remark 27. In the particular case when ϕ[q, u, p, λ]τ = u, Theorem 23 reduces to Theorem 10.
We verify this here in the interval t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 − τ , the procedure being similar for the interval
t2 − τ ≤ t ≤ t2. The stationary condition with time delay (47) gives p(t) = −∂3F [q]τ (t) −
∂5F [q]τ (t + τ ) and the second equation in the Hamiltonian system with time delay (45) gives
˙p(t) = −∂2F [q]τ (t) − ∂4F [q]τ (t + τ ). Comparing both equalities, one obtains the ﬁrst Euler–
Lagrange equation with time delay in (13). In other words, isoperimetric Pontryagin extremals
with time delay (Deﬁnition 24) are a generalization of the normal Euler–Lagrange extremals with
time delay (Deﬁnition 9).

In classical optimal control the DuBois–Reymond necessary optimality condition is generalized
to the equality dH
[25]. Next, we extend Theorem 14 (the DuBois–Reymond necessary
condition with time delay) to the more general isoperimetric optimal control setting with time
delay.

Theorem 28. If a triplet (q(·), u(·), p(·)) with q(·) ∈ C1 ([t1 − τ, t2]), p(·) ∈ C1 ([t1, t2]), and
u(·) ∈ C1 ([t1 − τ, t2]) is an isoperimetric Pontryagin extremal with time delay such that

∂4H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t + τ ) · ˙q(t) + ∂5H[q, u, p, λ]τ (t + τ ) · ˙u(t) = 0

and by performing a linear change of variables t = ν + τ in the last integral of (53) and using the
conditions (51), equation (53) becomes

We obtain condition (52) by substituting (45) and (47) into the ﬁrst integral, and substituting
(46) and (48) into the second integral of (54).

4 Conclusions and Open Questions

The isoperimetric problems are a mathematical area of a currently strong research, with numerous
applications in physics and engineering. The theory of conservation law in variational calculus
with delay systems was recently initiated in [10], with the proof of delayed Noetrher’s theorem.
In this paper we go a step further: we prove an isoperimetric Noether’s theorem with time delay.
The isoperimetric variational theory with time delay is in its childhood so that much remains to
be done. This is particularly true in the area of isoperimetric optimal control with time delay, where
the results are rare. Here, an isoperimetric Hamiltonian formulation with time delay is obtained.
To the best of the author’s knowledge, there is no general formulation of an isoperimetric version
of Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle. Then, with an isoperimetric notion of Pontryagin extremal,
one can try to extend the present results to the more general context of isoperimetric optimal
control with time delay.
