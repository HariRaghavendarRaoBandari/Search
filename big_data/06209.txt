A right triangular billiard system is equivalent to the system of two colliding particles conﬁned in
a one-dimensional box. In spite of their seeming simplicity, no deﬁnite conclusion has been drawn so
far concerning their ergodic properties. To answer this question, we transform the dynamics of the
right triangular billiard system to a piecewise map and analytically prove the broken ergodicity. The
mechanism leading to the broken ergodicity is discussed, and some numerical evidence corroborating
our conclusion is provided.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The conventional hypothesis used in statistical me-
chanics is that the time average of a system is equal to
its ensemble average in the limit of long measurement
time t because of its ergodicity. However, if a system
has a lot of metastable states, its phase trajectories may
be trapped in some subset of its total phase space for
long times. Consequently, the real behaviors often diﬀer
from the predictions based on the usual Gibbs formalism.
Though abundant related research results have been ob-
tained, studies on the dynamical and thermal properties
of these nonergodic systems still largely rely on intuition
and simple pictures of the phase spaces due to the lack
of a real theory [1], which stimulates interest in the er-
godic properties of variant disordered systems such as
glass systems [2, 3] and random walk models [4].

Another class of model systems whose ergodic prop-
erties have been studied for a long time are polygonal
billiards [5]. A remarkable theorem of Ref. [6] shows
that the one-parameter family of directional ﬂows f t
θ are
uniquely ergodic for Lebesgue almost all θ ∈ [0, 2π). In
particular, this theorem says that the directional billiard
ﬂow of a rational polygon, namely, all of its vertex angles
are rational multiples of π, is ergodic for almost every
direction. Ref. [7] lists some open problems of polygonal
billiard dynamics, including how to give an explicit ex-
ample of an irrational but nonergodic polygonal billiard.
As a relatively simple polygonal billiard, the right tri-
angular billiard has been studied extensively on its er-
godic properties. On one hand, it is generally acknowl-
edged that the billiard ﬂow in a rational right triangle,
namely, the acute angles of a right triangle are rational
multiples of π, is nonergodic [8]. On the other hand,
we know much less about the irrational cases. It is well
known that a right triangular billiard is equivalent to the
system of two hard particles colliding with each other and
the walls in a one-dimensional box [9]. Some researchers

have already investigated the ergodic properties of both
models, but did not get a deﬁnitive conclusion: while
some previous studies announced that for some special
parameters the former model is ergodic [10], there is nu-
merical evidence suggested that the latter model is not
[11, 12]. However, since these two models are equivalent,
their ergodic properties must be identical.

Moreover, a prevailing opinion is that nonergodic
Hamiltonian systems usually display a very complicated
and intricate structure of stable island in the phase space
among a sea of chaotic trajectories [13]. However, the
right triangular billiard does not belong to this situation.
So if it is nonergodic, it may shed light to the study of
ﬁnding other nonergodic mechanisms without the pres-
ence of divided phase space.

This paper provides an easier-to-manipulate method to
study right triangular billiard than that previous studies
used. By this method, we prove that the billiard ﬂow is
nonergodic due to localization in the velocity direction of
the particle. Besides, we give an explanation to the con-
tradiction between previous studies, and answer another
open question listed in Ref. [7].

Due to singularities in the billiard ﬂow, the phase tra-
jectories are discontinuous. Based on our understanding
of this fact, we transform the original model into a two-
dimensional piecewise map in Sec. II. Then we focus on
the map instead of the original model, all of whose impor-
tant properties are retained in the map. Some of these
properties, which are explored with the help of symbolic
sequence analysis in Sec. III, play a key role in the proof
of the broken ergodicity in Sec. IV. After that, the mech-
anism leads to ergodicity breaking will be discussed in
Sec. V. We also make extended discussions in Sec. VI.

II. THE MODELS

A right triangular billiard system describes the mo-
tion of a particle reﬂecting from the sides elastically in
a right triangle. The only control parameter of the sys-
tem is the acute angle α ∈ (0, π/2). To describe the
state of the particle at an arbitrary moment, i.e. to pin
down a point in the whole phase space, we need three

variables: two represent its position and one represents
its velocity-direction. The speed is a constant because all
collisions are elastic. However, if we focus on the instants
the particle collides with the hypotenuse, the two posi-
tion variables collapse to one variable x, i.e. the location
where the particle collides with the hypotenuse. We ﬁx
the length of the hypotenuse to be unity and set the α
vertex point to be the origin, then we have x ∈ [0, 1].
The velocity-direction variable is represented as the re-
bound angle θ ∈ (0, π) measured as Fig. 1 shows.
In
other words, we use two variables θ and x to make a
Poincar´e section of the phase space.

FIG. 1: A particle moves in a right triangular billiard whose
hypotenuse has unit length. The collisions between the par-
ticle and the sides are all elastic. The motion in the ﬁgure
from leaving xi to colliding with the hypotenuse at xi+1 is
denoted by a letter R, whose mapping formula for θ and x
can be derived using the law of sines.

The dynamics of the original model can be reduced to
a simpler form. Between two consecutive collisions with
the hypotenuse, there are three possible events. If we ﬁx
the xi value and vary θi from 0 to 2π, these three events
will appear in the following order: (1)only one collision
with the opposite side of α, (2)two collisions with both
legs respectively, (3)only one collision with the adjacent
side of α. Motived on this fact, we separate the mo-
tion of the particle at every instant right after it collides
with the hypotenuse, and denote the combination of a
collision with the hypotenuse and the followed event by
L, M , and R, respectively. In other words, every letter
represents one collision with the hypotenuse plus one or
two collisions with the legs. For example, as illustrated
in Fig. 1, a letter R represents the motion starts from
the instant right after the particle collides with the hy-
potenuse, through a collision with the adjacent side of
α, to the next collision with the hypotenuse. Using the
relation of the angels and the law of sines, we have

FIG. 2: (Color online) The forward iteration regions L, M ,
and R are partitioned by solid black lines. The backward iter-
ation regions R−1, M−1, and L−1 are partitioned by dashed
blue lines. The forward and backward iteration regions are
symmetric with respect to the dotted line ϑ = a/2.

This piecewise map describes the evolution rules on the
Poincar´e section, so it is equivalent to the dynamics of
right triangular billiard. As shown in Fig. 2, in light of
these equations we can partition the ϑ-x plane into three
forward regions correspond to L, M , and R, respectively.
A phase point is mapped to its next image according to
which region it belongs to. Performing the same pro-
cedure for its images, we can obtain its inﬁnite forward
symbolic sequence made of letter L, M , and R. A typical
inﬁnite forward sequence may be written as •P1P2P3 · · · ,
where • denotes the present state and Pi represents an L,
M , or R [14]. The points correspond to this inﬁnite for-
ward sequence belong to P1 region, then they are mapped
to P2 region following P1 part of Eq. (3), etc.

A symmetry of the original model is in the parameter
space: if we observe Fig. 1 from behind the paper, then

the parameter α becomes α′ = π/2 − α, and θ′ = π − θ,
x′ = 1−x. The corresponding symmetry of the piecewise
map appears as a′ = −a, ϑ′ = −ϑ, and x′ = 1 − x. This
means the system with parameter a is equivalent to that
with parameter −a. So it is suﬃcient to study only cases
with a ∈ (−2, 0](corresponding to α ∈ [π/4, π/2)) or
a ∈ [0, 2)(corresponding to α ∈ (0, π/4]).

The formulas of backward iteration can be derived

Likewise, we can partition the ϑ-x plane into three
backward regions correspond to R−1, M −1, and L−1,
respectively. A typical inﬁnite backward sequence may
be written as · · · Q3Q2Q1•, where Qi represents a R−1,
M −1, or L−1 and Q1 iteration happened most recently.
Generally speaking, a phase point one-to-one corresponds
to a bi-inﬁnite sequence · · · Q3Q2Q1 • P1P2P3(if exists).
In the following, we use the word “sequence” while its
length is ﬁnite unless otherwise indicated.

III. SEVERAL IMPORTANT PROPERTIES

Above we reduce the dynamics of the original model
to a two-dimensional map on the ϑ-x plane, which is a
Poincar´e section of the phase space. If the original model
is ergodic, the trajectories of the map must be dense on
the ϑ-x plane. Otherwise, the ergodicity of the model is
broken.

For the sake of convenience, if a sequence contains an
even number of M , we call it an even sequence; otherwise
we call it an odd sequence. Below we consider only even

be the diﬀerence between the total number of S in odd
position (right after the 2k-th M, k = 0, 1, 2, · · · ) and in
even positions (right before the 2k-th M, k = 0, 1, 2, · · · ).

sequences ﬁrst. Denoting by S a letter L or R, we let en
For example, en(SSM SM ) = 1, and en(M SSSM ) = −3.
Below we will show that this diﬀerenceen is an important

property of a sequence. In Eq. (3), though which map
the phase point will follow is partly depend on the x

3

values, the evolution formulas for ϑ do not request exact
x values, so we can calculate ϑN according to only ϑ0
and the sequence P1 · · · PN . Therefore, it is convenient
to use ϑN = P1 · · · PNϑ0 to record this relation, where
ϑN is the ϑ value of (ϑ0, x0)’ Nth image. Then we have

SMSϑ = Mϑ = a − ϑ
MMϑ = ϑ.

(5)

Eq. (5) provides two rules, based on which we can cal-
culate whether two sequences have identical eﬀect on the
ϑ variable. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that the eﬀect of an even
sequence on the ϑ variable depends only on its diﬀerence

mentioned above for example. SSMSMϑ0 = Sϑ0, and
MSSSMϑ0 = S−3S3MS3Mϑ0 = S−3ϑ0. Therefore, the
ϑ value of the image after an even sequence P1 · · · PN is

en , i.e. equals to that of sequence S en. Take the sequences
a function of ϑ0 and en, which can be denoted by

(6)

Θ(ϑ0, en) = Senϑ0,

On the x part, to simplify the notation, it is convenient
to use xN = P1 · · · PNx0 to record the evolution of x
values following a sequence P1 · · · PN , where xN is the x
value of (ϑ0, x0)’ Nth image. Here we omit the ϑ part of
the coordinate for convenience, but this does not mean
the evolution of x is independent with ϑ. Actually, when
we calculate the xi+1 in practice, we must take ϑi into
consideration. But since the ϑi can be derived from ϑ0
and the sequence, this omission is reasonable. Using such
notations, given an inﬁnitesimal perturbation d(x0) in
the x direction, we have

|d(Sx0)| =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

d(x0)

ϑ0

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

|d(SMSx0)| = |d(Mx0)| = |d(x0)| .

(7)

Here we assume that an inﬁnitesimal perturbation does
not change the forward sequence. Likewise, we can use
Eq. (7) to calculate the eﬀect of an even sequence on the
images with a tiny perturbation in the x direction. We
ﬁnd that the eﬀect of an even sequence on the perturba-

the stretch rate in the x direction is also a function of ϑ0

to that of sequence S en. For example, |d(SSMSMx0)| =

tion of image depends only on its diﬀerenceen , i.e. equals
|d(Sx0)|, and |d(MSSSMx0)| = (cid:12)(cid:12)d(S−3x0)(cid:12)(cid:12). Therefore,
and en, which can be denoted by
Ω(ϑ0, en) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

These two functions are the keys to proving the broken
ergodicity. The next thing we need to do is to derive
their expressions by introducing an intermediate variable.

We will prove the broken ergodicity of all right trian-
gular billiards in this section. To begin with, let us see
how to connect the ergodic property with symbolic se-
quences. On one hand, cases of rational π/α are easy
to deal with. Eq. (16) indicates that with ﬁxed ϑ0, ϑN

is either Θ(ϑ0, en) or a − Θ(ϑ0, en). Since Θ(ϑ0, en) is a
periodic function with period π/(2α) on en, if π/α is ra-

tional, the images of all points on line ϑ = ϑ0 can take
only a ﬁnite number of ϑ values, which results in broken
ergodicity. An equivalent result was suggested by Artuso
et al. in Ref. [8].

On the other hand, to solve the problem of irrational
cases, which is the main purpose of this paper, some more
complicated analysis is needed. Arbitrarily choose an
initial point (ϑ0, x0) with irrational π/α, we are able to
calculate how many diﬀerent ϑ values its ﬁrst N images
can take according to the ﬁrst N letters of its forward

sequence. There exists an upper limit 2(enmax −enmin + 1)
for this number, where enmax (respectively enmin) is the
maximum (respectively the minimum) of en the sequence

ever took. A trajectory which is dense in the phase space
must take inﬁnite number of ϑ values.

Therefore, the broken ergodicity of the model will be
proved if we show that the upper limit of almost every
initial point remains ﬁnite while N → +∞. Motivated

be a pre-image or an element of E(ϑ0, en); (2)E(ϑ0, en) is
a subset of E(ϑ0, en′) for en/en′ > 1 since en is further from
0 than en′ is.

mapped to Θ(ϑ0, em) before ever returning to ϑ0, it belongs to
E(ϑ0, em). Similarly, p3 belongs to E(ϑ0, en). On the contrary,
p1 is mapped back to line ϑ = ϑ0 before it is ever mapped
to line ϑ = Θ(ϑ0, en) or ϑ = a − Θ(ϑ0, en), so it belongs to
A(ϑ0, en) but not to E(ϑ0, en).

than the measure of E(ϑ0, fn2), and thus is smaller than

ing to the property (1) of E(ϑ0, en), any point belongs to
A(ϑ0, en) is either a pre-image or an element of E(ϑ0, en).

Therefore, A(ϑ0, ±∞) has measure zero as well, because
a point has only a countable number of pre-images. We
have thus proved that almost every point with ﬁxed ini-
tial ϑ0 can take only a ﬁnite number of diﬀerent ϑ values

Finally, we can construct a subset of the phase plane
to prove the broken ergodicity. Choose a small ξ, then

set of the phase plane may result from the inﬁnity of the
ϑ-x plane. To resolve this doubt, we rewrite the result
gotten before the ﬁnal step as “almost every point with
ﬁxed initial θ0 can take only a ﬁnite number of diﬀerent θ
values no matter how many iterations have been taken”,
then perform the ﬁnal step in θ-x plane, where iterations
keep the length in the θ direction and the whole phase
plane is ﬁnite. The same conclusion can be obtained.

V. THE MECHANISM

The interdependence between the ϑ of the image and
the stretch rate in the x direction restricts the number
of diﬀerent ϑ values a trajectory can take, thus the sys-
tem is nonergodic. Next we explain the mechanism of
the ergodicity breaking. If one observes a symbolic se-
quence of an arbitrary trajectory, he could ﬁnd many

sequence fragments whose en = 0. According to Eq. (5),

the ϑ value of the phase point before such a fragment
and that after the same fragment are equal or symmetric
with the respect to line ϑ = a/2. In other words, these
“ineﬃcient”sequence fragments make the images mean-
der within several ϑ values for long times. The lengths
of these sequence fragments we ever observed vary from
only several letters to 105 or even more letters, implying
that such phenomena appear in various time scales.

up to 4-M -level, i.e., points belong to the same small region
share a common string which includes four M letters. High-
level partition lines are steeper than low-level partition lines.

Several special properties are responsible for these “in-
eﬃcient”sequence fragments. One of these properties is
about the scopes of the partition lines in the phase plane.
The phase plane can be partitioned into diﬀerent regions.
Points belong to the same region share a common string
at the beginning of their inﬁnite sequences. Of course,
while we increase the length of the common string, part of
these points will not satisfy this condition, and a big re-
gion can be partitioned into several smaller regions. Par-
tition lines are the boundaries of the regions, so they can
be classiﬁed to diﬀerent levels. In practice, we can obtain
these partition lines by backward iterating the LM and
M R partition lines, which are two straight-line segments.

Since R−1, M−1 and L−1 all map a line segment to an-
other line segment, the partition lines in the phase plane
are all straight-line segments. Fig. 4 shows some low-level
partition lines in the M region. One can see that as the
levels of partition lines increase, the scopes of the par-
tition lines increase either. This feature results in that
the phase plane is partitioned into many slender almost-
vertical regions, and thus increases the average length of
common strings two nearby points with the same ϑ value
share. In other words, when a point is mapped to the
same ϑ and changes a bit on x, it is very likely to re-
peat part of the sequence it just followed. We call this
phenomenon “repeated motions”.

Another property contributes to the broken ergodicity
is the symmetry between the forward iteration and the
backward iteration. By comparing Eqs. (3) and (4), it
is easy to see the forward and backward iterations are
symmetric with respect to the line ϑ = a/2, as illustrated
in Fig 2. In other words, if point (ϑ, x) corresponds to bi-
inﬁnite sequence · · · Q3Q2Q1 • P1P2P3 · · · , its symmetric
point (a − ϑ, x) corresponds to · · · P3P2P1 • Q1Q2Q3 · · · .
Actually, this symmetry is the time reversal symmetry in
the original model, and two reﬂection symmetric points
correspond to the same state of the particle but viewed
in two opposite time directions.

This reﬂection symmetry generates “retraced motions”
in symbolic sequences. An M iteration brings ϑ to a − ϑ,
which is equal to reﬂecting about line ϑ = a/2. Consider
an initial point (a−ϑ, 1+a−ϑ−x) which is in M region,
i.e., it corresponds to a bi-inﬁnite sequence · · · Q2Q1 •
M P1P2 · · · , then its symmetric point (ϑ, 1 + a − ϑ −
x) corresponds to · · · P2P1M • Q1Q2 · · · . Meanwhile, a
forward iteration will map the point (a − ϑ, 1 + a − ϑ − x)
to (ϑ, x) and bring its sequence to · · · Q2Q1M • P1P2 · · · .
Notice that the symmetric point (ϑ, 1 + a − ϑ − x) and
the image (ϑ, x) have equal ϑ value, their sequences tend
to share a long common string. In general, the smaller
the distance |1 + a − ϑ − 2x| is, the longer their common
string is. Assume the ﬁrst k letters in the two sequences
are identical, then we have Pi = Qi for i ≤ k. Look
at this result in · · · Q2Q1M • P1P2 · · · , the sequence of
(ϑ, x), it means that when the trajectory meet the M ,

it retraces k iterations in the sequence, and bring the en

of the sequence back to k iterations ago. We call this
phenomenon “retraced motions”.

It is easy to see that both repeated motions and re-
traced motions generate many symbolic fragments whose

en = 0, thus keep the en values the same with and with-

out these symbolic fragments.
In addition, these two
kinds of motions work synergistically. A retraced mo-
tion is very likely to trigger a repeated motion, and a
repeated motion replicates the retraced motions in its
arrange. Besides, both kinds of motions occur in vari-
ous time scales. Several short-time motions construct a
long-time motion, then several such long-time motions
construct an even longer-time one, etc. The time scale
of the motions heavily depend on |1 + a − ϑ − 2x| or
|x − x′|. As the number of iterations increases, there are

more phase points whose coordinate values make one of
the distances very tiny. As a result, longer and longer-
time motions appear in the sequence, and the waiting
time to take a new ϑ value increases fast.

VI. DISCUSSION

Let K ∗ be the number of diﬀerent ϑ values a trajec-
tory has taken up to N iterations. We evolve an ensemble
of trajectories with the same initial ϑ0 but with random
initial x0 in the interval [0, 1] in order to explore the de-
pendence of K ∗ on N . The result is shown in Fig. 5.
The main outcome is that despite some ﬂuctuations K ∗
increases about linearly with ln N as N ≤ 1010. This
numerical evidence suggests that the iteration time N
requested to take K ∗ diﬀerent ϑ values increases expo-
nentially with K ∗, thus strongly conﬁrms our conclusion
that a trajectory will visit only a small fraction of the
allowed ϑ values in any meaningful time scale.

Our proof is in nice agreement with previous numerical
studies [11, 12]. In addition, the main result of Ref. [15],
namely, the trajectory of almost every initial point with
ϑ0 ∈ {±1, a/2} in an arbitrary right triangular billiard
is periodic, can be viewed as a special case of our con-
clusion. However, as mentioned in Sec. I, there is a con-
tradiction between previous studies that need to be ex-
plained. In Ref. [10], Vorobets proved that if the num-
bers αi/π admit a certain super-exponentially fast ra-
tional approximation, where αi are the vertex angles of
the polygon, then the billiard ﬂow has identical ergodic
properties with that in the rational polygons. In partic-
ular, he suggested that with some kind of weak irrational
α, the right triangular billiard ﬂow is ergodic based on
the ergodicity of rational polygonal billiards. But ratio-
nal right triangular billiard ﬂow is, unlike that in general
polygons, not ergodic [8]. Therefore, his suggestion is
incorrect, which explains the contradiction.

Our proof shows that irrational right triangular bil-
liard is an explicit example of irrational but nonergodic
polygonal billiards, thus provide an answer to an open
question listed in Ref. [7].
In addition, though general
polygonal billiards are believed to be ergodic, isosceles
triangular and rhombic billiards, whose dynamics are ex-
actly equivalent to that of right triangular billiard, are
two additional examples.

Right triangular billiard system has been studied for

decades [15–18]. Previous studies explored the properties
of the trajectories mainly using diagram methods, which
might create confusion in some cases. On contrast, our
method based on the piecewise map is much easier to
manipulate and verify. For example, one can easily exam
whether a special combination of collisions exists, or the
exact angle of the particle after a big number of certain
collisions. We think it will become a powerful tool for
further related study.
