This work is devoted to analyze the relation between the thermodynamic properties of a conﬁned
ﬂuid and the shape of its conﬁning vessel. Recently, new insights in this topic were found through the
study of cluster integrals for inhomogeneous ﬂuids, that revealed the dependence on the vessel shape
of the low density behavior of the system. Here, the statistical mechanics and thermodynamics of
ﬂuids conﬁned in wedges or by edges is revisited, focusing on their cluster integrals. In particular,
the well known hard sphere ﬂuid, which was not studied in this framework so far, is analyzed
under conﬁnement and its thermodynamic properties are analytically studied up to order two in the
density. Furthermore, the analysis is extended to the conﬁnement produced by a corrugated wall.
These results rely on the obtained analytic expression for the second cluster integral of the conﬁned
hard sphere system as a function of the opening dihedral angle 0 < β < 2π. It enables a uniﬁed
approach to both wedges and edges.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The thermodynamic properties of ﬂuids are inﬂuenced
by the geometry of either the vessel or substrate, which
constrain the spatial region where the molecules of the
systems move. Several eﬀorts are continuously devoted
to reach a detailed description of the response of ﬂuids
to some of the simplest geometrical constraints, includ-
ing the conﬁnement in pores with slit, cylindrical and
spherical shapes, as well as the case of ﬂuids in contact
with planar and curved walls. Even more, the behav-
ior of ﬂuids adsorbed in wedges, at edges,[1–4] and geo-
metrically structured surfaces was the subject of several
studies during the last decade.[5–7] The interest on con-
ﬁned inhomogeneous ﬂuids covers a wide range of com-
plexity and particles size, which starts at the simplest
one-atom per molecule (e.g. the noble gases) and goes
up to proteins, polymers (including DNA molecules) and
large colloids.[8–12]

The simplest model for the interaction potential be-
tween particles is based on of hard spheres (HS), which
reproduce the excluded volume eﬀect between particles.
This framework was applied not only to the study simple
ﬂuids, but also, to model the interaction between col-
loids. The HS model is so signiﬁcant that colloidal parti-
cles were synthesized to mimic this interaction.[13, 14]
Furthermore, recent simulations of conﬁned HS have
contributed with new interesting insights to the glass
transition.[15] Even more, the simplicity of HS make
them suitable for theoretical development.[16] Thus, sev-
eral approximate theories based on diﬀerent kind of per-
turbative approaches, for example mean ﬁeld, density
functional and diﬀerent type of series expansions, adopt
HS as the reference system to study more realist models
of ﬂuids.[17, 18] Given its simplicity, the HS system is

∗ iurrutia@cnea.gov.ar

particularly useful to elucidate the relationship between
the geometrical conﬁnement of a ﬂuid and its thermo-
dynamic properties.[19] Despite of its relevance and sim-
plicity, the exact or quasi-exact analytic results about the
HS homogeneous-ﬂuids are really scare. In the last years,
some analytic expressions for the thermodynamic prop-
erties of geometrically conﬁned HS ﬂuid were obtained
by analyzing the shape dependence of the low-order clus-
ter integral. In this framework, it was studied the ﬂuid
conﬁned by spherical[19–21], cylindrical, spheroidal and
box-shaped, surfaces.[22]

In this work I analyze the statistical mechanical and
thermodynamic properties of a ﬂuid conﬁned by edges
and wedges on the basis of the representation of its
grand potential in powers of the activity. In Sec. II the
edge/wedge conﬁnement is discussed and the functional
dependence of the cluster integral on the measures of the
edge/wedge is described. The Sec. III is dedicated to re-
visit the thermodynamics of the ﬂuid in an edge/wedge
conﬁnement, emphasizing the necessity of refer the prop-
erties of the system to a particular choice of the reference
region. This approach is used in Sec. V to analyze the HS
system. Sec. IV is devoted to obtain the analytic expres-
sion of the angle-dependent second cluster integral for
the HS ﬂuid covering the complete angular range which
includes both edges and wedges. In Sec. V the resulting
second cluster integral is used to derive analytic expres-
sions for the thermodynamic properties (pressure, surface
tension, line tension, surface- and linear- adsorptions) of
the conﬁned HS ﬂuid up to order two in density. The new
expressions for the line-tension and the line-adsorption
show the dependence with the opening dihedral angle.
Finally, the low density behavior of the HS ﬂuid in con-
tact with a corrugated wall is studied. The Sec. VI is
devoted to the ﬁnal remarks.

A in light-gray (green) particles are free to move while the

the opening angle both light-gray (green) and white regions
have dihedral shape. The dihedral shape of A determines that
both Figs. a and b are straight-edge type conﬁnements.

II. CLUSTER INTEGRALS FOR A FLUID

CONFINED BY WEDGES

Let a system of HS particles with diameter σ conﬁned
by a hard external potential φ (r) to either an edge or
wedge (dihedral) shape region A. Trough current work
the open dihedron geometrical shape will be simply re-
ferred to as dihedron. For this system at temperature T
it was recently shown that the i-th cluster integral, τi,
takes the linear form[19, 23]

τi/i! = biV − aiA + ciL .

(1)

Here the dihedron A is characterized by its volume V , its
surface area A, the length of its edge L and the opening
dihedral angle between faces, β (inner to the ﬂuid). The
volume coeﬃcients bi are the well known Mayer’s cluster
integrals for homogeneous systems and the area coeﬃ-
cients ai are related to those introduced by Bellemans
for a ﬂuid adsorbed on an inﬁnite wall.[24, 25] The ﬁrst
cluster integral is τ1 = b1V with b1 = 1, while the rest of
coeﬃcients (i > 1) bi and ai are independent of β. For
the well known HS ﬂuid, several bi and ai were evaluated
(for i = 2, 3, 4, 5 see Ref.
[19]). Finally, regarding the
functions ci (β) they are still unknown even at the lowest
non-trivial order i = 2.

In next sections two diﬀerent types of edge/wedge con-
ﬁnement will be analyzed. The dihedron A, displayed
in Fig. 1, corresponds to the region available for the
center of each particle. This straight-edge conﬁnement
is deﬁned by the Boltzmann factor exp [−φ (r) /kT ] =
Θ(cid:0)|r − C|(cid:1), being k the Boltzmann constant, Θ(cid:0)x(cid:1) the
Heaviside function [Θ(cid:0)x(cid:1) = 1 if x > 0 and zero other-
wise], C = A \ R3 the complement dihedral region, and
|r − C| the shortest distance between r and C. A diﬀerent
type of conﬁnement is deﬁned by the Boltzmann factor
exp [−φ (r) /kT ] = Θ(cid:0)|r − C| − σ
2(cid:1) with C the solid dihe-
dral region and σ
2 the minimum solid-particle distance.
This last case is drawn in Fig. 2 where C is dark and
the forbidden region between A and C is shown in white.
From a comparison between Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 one notes
that region A is a dihedron not only in Figs. 1 a and

while Fig. b corresponds to the case β > π. Dashed circles

ticles lying near the edge. The arrows show characteristic

to a rounded-edge conﬁnement.

b, but also in Fig. 2 a. Therefore, the case represented
in Fig. 2a also corresponds to a straight-edge conﬁne-
ment. On the contrary, the region A shown in Fig. 2b
is not a dihedron because A has a curved end-of-ﬂuid
surface. This situation corresponds to a rounded-edge
conﬁnement. Since Eq.
(1) was originally derived for
straight-edges, its extension to include the rounded-edge
case is presented in Sec. IV B. Note that the above dis-
cussion regarding diﬀerent type of edge/wedge conﬁne-
ments essentially concerns to the conﬁning potential but
not with the inter-particles potential.

III. THERMODYNAMICS OF A FLUID IN A

EDGE/WEDGE CONFINEMENT

To analyze the thermodynamic properties of the sys-
tems presented in Figs. 1 and 2 it is necessary to adopt a
reference region (RR) R. It should be underlined that for
studying inhomogeneous ﬂuids is crucial to clearly estab-
lish the adopted R, which ﬁxes the position and shape
of the surface of tension, ∂R. This issue is as fundamen-
tal as to clearly establish the system of reference in the
study of a mechanical system. In this work it is adopted
the density based RR (d-RR), i.e. the region where the
one-body density distribution is non-null. This is in fact
the region A shown in Figs. 1 and 2.
Let us consider a ﬂuid conﬁned by a hard wall edge
at ﬁxed T and chemical potential µ.
Its grand po-
tential taken with regard to the d-RR with measures
M = (V, A, L) is given by

Ω = −P V + γA + T L .

(2)

Here, P is the pressure, γ is the wall-ﬂuid surface tension
(or excess surface free-energy), and T is the edge-ﬂuid

line-tension (or excess line free-energy). Naturally, the
Mayer series of the grand potential of the system is given
by

Ω
kT

τi

zi ,

(3)

where z = Λ−3 exp(µ/kT ) is the activity of the ﬂuid and
Λ the de Broglies length. It is generally accepted that
Eq. (3) is rigorous as long as condensation is excluded
(see p.131 of the book of Hill[23]). Here it is suﬃcient
to assume that it converges for 0 < z < R (for some
R > 0). Since both Eqs. (1) and (2) are linear in the
measures M , therefore, Eq. (3) gives the power series in z
representation of the intensive thermodynamic properties
P , γ and T . The mean number of particles in the system
is N = − z

∂Ω
∂z , and thus one obtain

(4)

(5)

here, ΓA is the excess adsorption per unit area (of the
boundary of A) and ΓL is the excess adsorption per unit
length. Again, linear relations (1, 4) and the power series
in z shown in (5) enable us to obtain the power series of
the densities ρ(z), ΓA(z), and ΓL(z). A linear decompo-
sition, similar to that found for Ω and N , is also obtained
for the ﬂuctuation σ 2
∂z . This pro-
vides the power series in z for each term in σ 2
N that scales
with V , A and L. Further, standard methods enable to
transform the power series in z to power series in ρ.[23]
Notably, from the Eqs.
(2) to (4) and the thermody-
namic deﬁnition of N [see expression above Eq. (4)] one
can deduce the Gibbs adsorption equation for the sur-
face adsorption ΓA = −∂γ/∂µ and also its analogous,
the Gibbs adsorption equation for the linear adsorption

N ≡ (cid:10)N 2(cid:11) − N 2 = z ∂N

ΓL = −∂T /∂µ .

(6)

The conﬁnement of the systems drawn in Fig. 1 is
purely characterized by the region A where the density
distribution could be non-null. For this type of conﬁne-
ment the unique simple choice for RR is A itself. On the
other hand, even when the systems shown in Fig. 2 can
also be analyzed under the same density-based R other
RR could be adopted. The relation between the thermo-
dynamic properties obtained under diﬀerent choices of R
will be studied in a forthcoming paper. It is worthwhile
to note that by adopting the density-based R, the sys-
tems depicted in Fig. 1a and Fig. 2a are identical, and
thus, they have identical properties.

a system more general than the HS, in which a pair of
particles interact through the potential ψ (r) with ﬁnite
range ξ [ψ(r > ξ) = 0]. For this case, the Eq. (1) also
holds.[26] The Mayer’s function of the ﬂuid conﬁned in a
region A is f (r) = exp [−ψ (r) /kT ] − 1 while its second
cluster integral reads[23]

τ2 = ˆA

f (r12) dr1dr2 ,

(7)

with r1, r2 the position of each particle of the pair and
r12 the distance between them. Given that A has one
edge with inner-dihedral angle β (see Figs. 1 and 2a),
the coeﬃcient c2 (β) is given by[26]

2c2 (β) = −2ˆD1

where r(2) is in the plane orthogonal to the edge direction
while g1(x) and g2(x) are partial integrals of f (r12). For
the case 0 < β < π/2, the integration domains are

D1 = I ∪ II ∪ III ,
D2 = I ∪ II .

(9)
(10)

Regions I, II and III are shown in Fig. 3. The continu-
ous line shows the boundary of the region A, ∂A, which
is deﬁned by two planar faces. Parallel to each face, at
a distance ξ, there is a plane plot with dashed line. A
particle placed at r ∈ A in the region between dashed
and continuous parallel lines is surrounded by an sphere
with radii ξ that lies partially outside of A. This sphere
separates the interacting region from the non-interacting
region.

From here on the analysis will only concern to the HS
system and for simplicity I ﬁxed the hard repulsion dis-
tance σ = ξ = 1. For this system the volume and area
coeﬃcients of τ2 are: b2 = −2π/3 and a2 = −π/8. At
present, the value of c2 (β) is only known for two angles

being c2(π/2) = −1/15 and c2(3π/2) = −1/15.[22] In ad-
dition, it is expected that c2 (β → π) = 0 due to the edge
vanishes. Turning to Eq. (7), for HS f (x) = −Θ (1 − x).
By ﬁxing r1, f ((cid:12)(cid:12)r1 − r2(cid:12)(cid:12)) determines the so-called ex-
clusion unit sphere (centered at r1) for which f (r12) is
non-null. Concerning to the functions g1 (r) and g2 (r),
they measure the volume of the portion of the exclusion
unit sphere centered at r that lies outside of A when r
is near to ∂A. Table I summarizes the diﬀerent shapes
that the outer portion of the exclusion sphere can take.
There, f (e) is the number of faces (edges) intersected by
the unit sphere, j is an extra label for f = 2, and for each
j corresponds a diﬀerent gf,j (r) function. Given r and a
face of A, I deﬁne the x as the normal coordinate of r
relative to this face and positive in the inward direction.
Thus, g1 (x) is the volume of that part of the unit ball
that lies in the semi-space with negative coordinate; i.e.,
if x > 1 then g1 (x) = 0, if −1 ≤ x ≤ 1 then
π (2 + x) (1 − x)2 ,

g1 (x) =

(11)

while for the case x < −1 g1 (x) = 4π/3. On the other
side, given a position r and a pair of intersecting faces
that ﬁx the coordinates x and x′, g2(cid:0)r(2)(cid:1) is the volume
g2(cid:0)r(2)(cid:1) is equal to zero, 4π/3, g1 (x) or g1 (x′). For the

of the unit ball that lies in the region where at least
one of these coordinates is negative. In the simple cases

less trivial cases and assuming that x, x′ > 0 one has

g2,3 = h(cid:0)r(2)(cid:1)

if j = 1 ,
if j = 2 ,
if j = 3, β ≤ π ,
if j = 3, β > π .

(12)
Here, h(r(2)) is the intersecting volume between the unit
ball and the dihedron, that lies in the region where both
coordinates are negatives. To make further progress I
analyze the case 0 < β < π
2 for which h(cid:0)r(2)(cid:1) = v (r, θ) +
v (r, β − θ), with r and θ the polar coordinates. An ex-
plicit expression for v was obtained by Rowlinson.[27]
After taking into account trigonometric identities in Eq.
(2.8) of Ref.[27], the following expression for v is obtained

Figure 4. Exclusion sphere of radius σ near the edge of A
for r in region II. The outer region of the sphere with vol-
ume v (r, θ) is in lighter gray (pink) while that with volume
v (r, β − θ) is dark (red).

Fig. 4 shows the exclusion sphere (dashed circle) near the
edge for the case f = 2 and j = 3 (0 < β < π
2 ) with r in
the region II. There, the outer regions of the sphere with
volumes v (r, θ) and v (r, β − θ) are also presented. If r is
in the region II then g2 = g2,3 (as is the case of Fig. 4).
On the other hand, if r is in the region I then g2 = g2,1.
Taking into account Eq.

(10), the integral of g2(cid:0)r(2)(cid:1)
over D2 reduces to 2´I∪II g1 (x) dr(2)− 2´II v (r, θ) dr(2).

Using this expression and Eq. (9) to transform Eq. (8)
one found

c2 (β) = −ˆIII

g1 (x) dr

(14)

The integral over region III gives π cot (β) /15. On the
other hand, to solve the integral over region II one intro-

duces the change of integration variable r → √1 − s2 to
obtain (1 − β cot β) /15. Finally one found (for 0 < β ≤
π/2)

c2 (β) = −

[1 + (π − β) cot β] .

(15)

In principle, the procedure can be reproduced for each
of the ranges π/2 < β ≤ π, π < β ≤ 3π/2, and 3π/2 <
β < 2π, but the expressions for v become more complex,
the domains of integration change, and the integral of v
becomes harder to solve. Thus, an alternative approach
to analyze the range π/2 < β < 2π is presented below
(see Sec. IV A). Here I advance the result: the Eq. (15)
applies to the complete range 0 < β < 2π.

A. Other ranges of beta

With the aim of circumvent the integral on v, I will
use a statistical-based analysis. Let us consider a region
U of the space, composed by the disjoint union of re-
gions A and B. If one drops a particle randomly in U the
probability of ﬁnding it in A (PA) or in B (PB) relate by

Figure 5. Picture showing the statistical-based approach to
relate the edge term of τ2 (A) with that of τ2 (B). Dihedral
region B, with opening angle β′, is in white. For the region
A (green) with β < π/2, the term c2 (β) is given in Eq. (15).
Subﬁgure a is for the case of supplementary angles β + β′ = π
2 < β′ < π, while Subﬁgure b is for the case of add-full
with π
angles β + β′ = 2π with π < β′ < 2π.

Let us consider a pair of (distinguishable) particles la-
beled as particle-1 and particle-2, randomly dropped in
U. I will focus on the case where particles form a cluster
(i.e., they lie at a distance r < 1) and introduce PXY
which is the probability that particle-1 lies in the region
X while the particle-2 lies in the region Y. Thus, for the
case of a pair of clustered particles one found the follow-
ing relations

1 = PAA + PBB + 2PAB ,

PAA = PAU − PAB ,
PBB = PBU − PBA ,

(17)
(18)
(19)

with PAB = PBA. Each of these probabilities is related
to the volume of the coordinates phase space that corre-
sponds to a cluster integral by the expression

PXY = τXY/τUU .

(20)

Here τXY is the second cluster integral with the restric-
tion that particle-1 is in X while particle-2 is in Y (with
τXY = τYX). Thus, any of the Eqs. (17) to (19) can be
translated to a relation between cluster integrals.

Let the region U be the semi-space S that is partitioned
in two wedge-shaped regions labelled A and B with di-
hedral angles β and β′ = π − β (with 0 < β < π
2 ),
respectively, as it is indicated in Fig. 5a. Based on Eqs.
(17) and (20), the cluster integral τ2 for the system con-
strained to diﬀerent regions are related one to each other.
Thus, one ﬁnds

τSS = τAA + τBB + 2τAB ,

(21)

and from Eq. (1)

τSS = 2b2VS − 2a2A ,
τAA = 2b2VS

τBB = 2b2VS

β
π − 2a2A + 2c2 (β) L ,
β′
π − 2a2A + 2c2 (β′) L ,

(22)

(23)

(24)

where VS is the volume of the semi-space, A is the area
of the inﬁnite plane, and L is the length of the straight
line. Eqs. (21, 22, 23) and (24) imply that τAB should

5

be a linear function in VS, A and L. In fact, by equating
term by term in Eq. (21) it is obtained

τAB = −a2A + 2cmix (β) L ,

(25)

with cmix (β) = 1
2 [c2 (β) + c2 (β′)] which is symmetric
in the angles, i.e. c2mix (β) = c2mix (β′). On the same
basis, Eqs. (18) and (19) are equivalent to

τAA = τAS − τAB ,
τBB = τBS − τAB ,

(26)
(27)

which shows that τAS and τBS are both linear in VS, A
and L. Moreover, by combining the Eqs. (26, 27) and
(21) one found

τSS = τAS + τBS .

(28)

Finally, one introduces 2caux (β) and 2caux (β′) as the L
coeﬃcients in τAS and τBS, respectively. Therefore, Eq.
(28) shows that caux is antisymmetric in the angles, i.e.
caux (β′) = −caux (β). It is clear that if caux (β) is known
one can obtain caux (β′), cmix (β) and also c2 (β′). An in-
teresting point is that τAS [related to caux (β)] is simpler
to solve than any of the integrals τBB, τAB or τBS [related
to c2 (β′), cmix (β) and caux (β′), respectively] because in
τAS the particle-2 is basically unconstrained while the
particle-1 is constrained to A and thus the analysis done
II can be used. Utilizing an
in the ﬁrst part of Sec.
[26] to obtain
approach similar to that adopted in Ref.
Eq. (1), it is found τAS = 2b2VS
π − a2A + 2caux (β) L
with caux (β) = 1
2 ´III g1 (z) dr(2) [see Eq. (14)]. There-
fore, caux (β) = π
30 cot β and cmix (β) = c2 (β) for
all the range 0 < β < π. Even more, c2 (β′) =
− 1
15 [1 − (π − β′) cot β′]. This is exactly the same ex-
pression given in Eq. (15), i.e., we have shown that Eq.
(15) applies in the extended domain 0 < β < π.

β

The same approach enable us to study the case π <
β < 2π. In Figure 5b it is shown the partition of the real
space U in two dihedrons with inner angles β and β′ =
2π − β, respectively. The Eqs. (17) to (21), that relate
probabilities and cluster integrals in diﬀerent regions are
still valid with the label S replaced by label U, and

τUU = 2b2V ,

(29)

where V is the volume of the complete space. Thus,
following the same procedure described above one notes
that Eqs. (23) to (28) still apply, by changing VS by V
and 1/π by 1/2π, while A and L remain unchanged. By
combining Eqs. (26) and (27) one obtains

τBB = τBU + τAA − τAU .

(30)

In this case τAU = 2b2V β
implies c2 (β′) = c2 (β). Therefore,

2π and τBU = 2b2V β ′

2π , which

c2 (β) = −

1
15

[1 + (π − β) cot β] ,

(31)

is ﬁnally valid for all the range 0 < β < 2π.

6, it is shown c2 (β) for the straight- and rounded-edge,
conﬁnements. The expression for the straight-edge con-
ﬁnement, taken from Eq. (31), is plotted in continuous
line. One observes that this c2 (β) is non-positive, is sym-
metric around β = π, has smooth (analytic) behavior at
β ≈ π where c2 is zero, and diverges for both β → 0 and
β → 2π. The results obtained in Sec. IV B for c2(β) of
the rounded-edge conﬁnement are also included in Fig.
6. There, two diﬀerent ﬂavors of the density based ref-
erence region are presented. In dashed line it is shown
d1-RR while dotted line refers to d2-RR [Eqs. (36) and
(38), respectively]. All the curves reach the zero value at
vanishing edge/wedge with β = π.

B. The rounded-edge

Here, I analyze the eﬀect on the HS ﬂuid produced by
a solid dihedron that repel the core of each particle. Fig.
2 shows the edge of a solid dihedron with β < π and with
β > π (Figs. 2a and 2b, respectively). There, the dark
region constitutes the solid wall, in white is the excluded
region induced on the HS ﬂuid by the wall (forbidden for
the particles center), and in lighter gray (green) is the
In Fig.
available region for the center of particles, A.
2a one can observe that the dihedral walls induce near
the edge a ﬂuid-ﬁlled region A with dihedral shape, and
therefore, the c2 obtained above in Sec.
IV A applies.
On the contrary, in Fig. 2b the solid dihedron induces a
curved end-of-ﬂuid interface region with cylindrical shape
and radius 1/2. For this type of cylindrical-shape bound-
ary of A it is necessary to analyze the decomposition of
the cluster integrals. Following the procedure described
in Ref.[26] and focusing on the HS ﬂuid, in a ﬁrst step
one separates the integral domain A over bulk and skin
regions (this last in the neighborhood of ∂A). On a sec-
ond step the planar faces domains are separated from
that in the near-edge region of A. Note that under this

approach the surface area A in Eqs. (1, 2) and (5) is the
area of the planar region of ∂A.
For the case of a rounded-edge conﬁnement depicted
in Fig. 2b the overall procedure leave us again with the
expression given in Eq. (8), but now, g2 is the volume of
that part of the exclusion sphere outside of A when the
intersection of the sphere with ∂A is non-planar. More-
over, the domains are given in terms of regions II, II ′
and IV by

D1 = II ,
D2 = II ∪ II ′ ∪ IV .

These regions are shown in Fig. 7. Unfortunately, the
involved integrals are not analytically solvable. I found

double integrals to obtain

In Fig. 8a and b the nearly-linear

In Fig. 8b the exact dependence G = 8
45 (β − π) is also
plotted. A small deviation of c2(β) from the linear be-
havior is caused by Q, which is shown in Fig. 8c with the
abscissa axes augmented in a factor 102. I ﬁt the points
using an exponential form with two adjusting parameters
and ﬁnd Q = 0.007125 {1 − exp [−2.74 (β − π)]}, which
is included in Fig. 8c. Therefore, the result for β > π is

c2(β) =

(36)

which is shown in dashed-line in Fig. 8a. This expression
describes with high precision the results of numerical in-
tegration. For comparison, Eq. (36) is also plotted in
Fig. 6 using a dashed line. The two main diﬀerences
with respect to Eq. (31) are: its positiveness and its ﬁ-
nite value attained in the limit β → 2π. This approach,

that focus in the surface area of the planar part of ∂A,
is appointed as d1-RR.
To further analyze the obtained c2 (β) in d1-RR one
can write the edge term of τ2/2 emphasizing its de-
pendence on the area of the cylindrical surface Acyl =
(β − π) 1

c2(β) L = −a2,cylAcyl + Q L ,

(37)

with the coeﬃcient for the cylindrical surface area,
a2,cyl = − 16
45 = −0.3555. One observes that the behavior
of c2(β) × L is driven by its linearity with the surface
area, which resembles the area dependence of τ2 and has
the same sign. Alternatively, Eq. (37) suggest that one
may adopt a slightly diﬀerent RR by focusing on the to-
tal surface area of ∂A. Once the contribution −a2Acyl is
added (and subtracted) to τ2 one obtains

c2(β) = (cid:18) 8

(38)

that is designated by d2-RR. Note that under this ap-
proach the surface area A in Eqs. (1, 2, 5) is the total area
of ∂A that complains both, the planar and cylindrical
surfaces. It is interesting to highlight that Eq. (36) and
Eq. (38) describe the rounded-edge conﬁnement shown
in Fig. 2b. The diﬀerence lies in the adopted dissection
of ∂A.

V. RESULTS

Turning to the thermodynamic properties of the HS
system conﬁned by a single edge/wedge, they can be ex-
panded as power series in z and then as power series in
ρ. From here on, I truncate all the series to second order
and thus terms of order O(z3) and O(ρ3) are depreciated.
Taking into account the known values of b2 and a2, one
ﬁnds for the low density regime:

P/kT = ρ + ρ22π/3 ,

γ/kT = −ρ2π/8 and ΓA = ρ2π/4 .

(39)

These expressions correspond to the known expansions,
of the pressure of a bulk HS ﬂuid, of the ﬂuid-wall surface
tension, and of the ﬂuid-wall surface adsorption (when a
HS ﬂuid is conﬁned by a planar hard-wall ), respectively.
Furthermore, the correspondence between the obtained
series for P , γ and ΓA, and the known series expansions
also apply when higher order terms in z and ρ are con-
sidered. Therefore, Eq. (39) helps to deﬁne accurately
the meaning of the intensive magnitudes introduced in
Eqs. (2) and (4). The line-thermodynamic properties of
the HS ﬂuid conﬁned by an edge/wedge are
T /kT = −c2ρ2 and ΓL = 2c2ρ2 .

(40)

From simple inspection of Eqs. (39) and Eq. (40), one
notes that γ/kT (T /kT ) is minus one half of ΓA (ΓL).

2π. Continuous lines (with ﬁlled symbols) show results for the
straight-edge conﬁnement while dashed and dotted lines cor-
respond to rounded-edge (d1-RR and d2-RR, respectively).

It is interesting to note that using the Gibbs adsorption
equations [see Eq. (6)] up to terms of order z2 one ﬁnds

γ/kT = −ΓA/2 and T /kT = −ΓL/2 .

(41)

Therefore, these remarkable relations (that holds up to
terms of order ρ2) does not only apply to the HS ﬂuid, but
also, to any ﬂuid conﬁned by hard-wall edges and wedges.
In fact, as long as τi were given by Eq. (1), the relations
in Eq.
(41) should be also valid for planar walls and
wedges that interact with the particles trow a less trivial
external potential φ (r) than the inﬁnite repulsion. The
adsorption equations given in Eq. (41) are very similar
to the ideal gas equation of state P/kT = ρ in several
aspects. In particular, they are simple relations between
free-energy densities, number densities and temperature,
i.e. they are simple equations of state of the adsorbed
gas. These ideal-adsorption equations include terms up
to order ρ2, terms of the same order are not included in
the pressure of the ideal gas.

In Fig.

9 the density dependence of line tension
(scaled with temperature) and line-adsorption for several
edges/wedges with β < π, are shown (see Figs. 1a and
2a). Diﬀerent curves correspond to four diﬀerent angles.
There, the line tension curves are positive but line ad-
sorption ones are negatives. The curves for larger values
of β are near to the zero ordinate axis, which corresponds
to the limiting case β = π of an edge that vanishes in an
inﬁnite planar wall. On the contrary, in the limit β → 0
both T /kT and ΓL diverge (not shown in the Figure)
because c2(β) diverges. This can be rationalized as the
impossibility of attaining the dimensional crossover to
the hard disc system with Eq.
(36) because an extra
non-analytic term should appears in the case of β → 0.
This was previously veriﬁed for the HS system under con-
ﬁnement in box-shaped cavities.[22] Note that, no matter
the value of β (in the range 0 < β < π) the HS system
apparently desorbs from the edge/wedge region (it has a
negative adsorption). This unexpected behavior comes

from the direct analysis of the pure line-adsorption term
ΓL given in Eq. (4). I will return to this point at the end
of this section.

Fig. 10 presents the behavior of line-adsorption with
density for diﬀerent edges/wedges that correspond to
β > π.
In the inset, the details of a region near the
horizontal axis is shown. Straight lines correspond to the
straight-edge conﬁnement (see Fig. 1b) while discontin-
uous lines correspond to the rounded-edge case (see Fig.
2b). The dashed and dotted lines correspond to the dif-
ferent criteria adopted for the dissection of ∂A, d1-RR
and d2-RR, respectively. I wish to note some interesting
features of Fig. 10 that follows from the obtained c2 (β)
results (see Fig. 6). First, one observes that for a ﬁxed
β (and considering d1-RR), the pure line-adsorption on
straight- and rounded-edges are very diﬀerent (they have
opposite sign). Second, for the rounded-edge the line-
adsorption obtained using d1-RR diﬀers strongly from
that obtained by using d2-RR. Thus, based on these is-
sues one concludes that straight-edges behaves very dif-
ferent to rounded-edges, and also, that given a ﬁxed phys-
ical constraint the adoption of diﬀerent RRs may produce
strongly diﬀerent results. A third noticeable character-
istic is that straight-edges show apparent desorption for
any (nontrivial) dihedral angle. A comparison between
Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 shows that this apparent desorption is
symmetric around β = π, i.e. ΓL(π−∆β) = ΓL(π +∆β).
Turning to Fig. 10, one notes that in all cases the
curves for smaller values of β are nearer to the zero ordi-
nate axis (which gives the limiting planar-wall case β = π
of a vanishing edge). The other interesting limit for ΓL
is β → 2π. There, the curve for the rounded-edge does
not diverge, but ΓL for the straight-edge diverges (not
shown in the ﬁgure) because c2(β) [see Eq. (8)] diverges
too. This can be rationalized again by recognizing that
Eq. (36) is unsuitable to analyze the conﬁnement pro-
duced by a vanishing straight-wedge, because an extra

non-analytic term should appear in the case of β → 2π.
In this limit of the straight-edge case, the available re-
gion for the ﬂuid A becomes the complete space with
volume V (in fact one should subtract half plane, that
has zero volume measure), and thus, the homogeneous
system result τ2 = 2b2V should be recovered. In Fig. 11
the dependence of line-tension with density for diﬀerent
edges/wedges with π < β ≤ 2π, is shown. The inset
shows a detail of a region near the axis. One notes that
for the straight-edge conﬁnement the line tension (i.e. the
line component of the Grand free-energy) monotonically
increases with increasing β (from β = π) and diverges
for all densities at β → 2π because this limit can not be
described by Eq. (8). The reasons of this behavior are
the same discussed in the case of Fig. 10. Other features
observed in Fig. 11 follow the characteristics noted for
the curves in Fig. 10. Perhaps, the most interesting re-
sult about T is not in the plotted curves in Fig. 11 but
on the existence of the analytic expression for T , in fact,
it enable us to give the analytic expression of the grand
free energy Ω (β, ρ) up to order ρ2.

The unexpected apparent desorption and symmetry of
ΓL for system conﬁned by a straight-edge, and the strong
dependence of ΓL on the adopted RR for system conﬁned
by a rounded-edge, both suggest an alternative approach
to analyze the adsorption produced by edges and wedges.
I realize that a more meaningful deﬁnition of edge/wedge
adsorption that considers ﬁnite volumes and sets as ref-
erence the planar wall is possible. Thus, I introduce the
mean excess of adsorbed density

∆ρ = N (r)/V (r) − ρ .

(42)

where N (r) is the mean number of particles in a suitably
selected region with volume V (r) and thickness r. A
similar approach enable us to introduce the mean excess
of free-energy density

∆ω = Ω(r)/V (r) + P ,

(43)

here Ω(r) is the free-energy of the N (r) particles in V (r).
Both ∆ρ and ∆ω quantify the local behavior of the HS

system in the neighborhood of the apex. The analytic
expressions of the mean excess densities ∆ρ and ∆ω for
the straight-edge and for the rounded-edge are deduced
in the Appendix A. Both, ∆ρ and ∆ω are proportional
to ρ2 (terms of higher order are not considered in current
work). Under the adopted truncation of terms O(ρ3) the
distance between ∂A and the zone of the spatial den-
sity distribution where it attains its bulk value ρ is 1,
thus, I ﬁxed r = 1.
It is convenient to introduce the
relative mean excess values of the adsorbed density and
free-energy density,

∆ρrel =

and ∆ωrel =

,

(44)

respectively. One can note some properties of ∆ρrel and
∆ωrel: they are independent of the number density ρ and
only depend on β, their analytic expressions are the same
i.e. ∆ρrel = ∆ωrel, and if the d2-RR is adopted (in place
of d1-RR) the expressions for ∆ρrel and ∆ωrel remain
unmodiﬁed. An important diﬀerence between ∆ρrel and
∆ωrel is the sign of the denominator in Eq. (44). Given
that ∆ρwall > 0 it follows that ∆ρrel > 0 ⇔ ∆ρ > 0.
On the contrary, ∆ωwall < 0 and thus it follows that
∆ωrel > 0 ⇔ ∆ω < 0. This implies that a maximum in
∆ωrel indicates a minimum in ∆ω. In Fig. 12 the relative
magnitudes ∆ρrel and ∆ωrel are plotted. Continuous line
shows the result for the straight-edge conﬁnement [see
Eq. (A3)] while the dot-dashed line corresponds to the
rounded-edge. Note that, the symmetry found in c2(β),
ΓL and T /kT for the straight-edge [c2(β) = c2(2π − β)
for 0 < β < π] disappears in ∆ρrel and ∆ωrel. The
curves show that in the neighborhood of a very acute
edge (0 < β . 0.091π) the HS gas desorbs, as it also
happens for the gas near a solid wedge (β > π). In the
intermediate range 0.091π . β < π that includes acute
and obtuse edges the HS gas adsorbs, with a peak of
maximum adsorption at β ≈ 0.17π with ∆ρrel ≈ 3.2. All
these trends agree with that found in Ref. [30], where the

single bulk density ρ = 0.7016 (which is not a small den-
sity because ﬂuid-solid transition is at ρ ≈ 1) was studied
using free-energy density functional theory (DFT). Be-
sides, the local mean density of free-energy relative to the
planar-wall condition follows exactly the same behavior
that shows ∆ρrel, which implies a minimum of mean ex-
cess of free-energy density ∆ω at β ≈ 0.17π. The results
presented in Fig. 12 slightly depend on the details of the
adopted region V (r) and on the adopted value of r. Al-
though, the discussed general trends remain unmodiﬁed.
As an indication of this feature, the values obtained using
a diﬀerent deﬁnition of V (r) are shown with a small cir-
cle (the maximum) and a small square (the rounded-edge
value for β = 2π). More details are given in Appendix
A.

A. Adsorbed HS gas on a Corrugated wall

The results shown in Fig. 12 motivated the study
of a more complex geometrical conﬁnement than edges
and wedges. Here, I analyze the properties of the HS
gas on contact with a corrugated wall in the low density
regime, by focusing in the total adsorption and surface
free-energy of the system. Adsorption is an easy measur-
able magnitude accessible through experiments, through
a variety of simulations techniques (molecular dynamics
and MonteCarlo) and also using DFT. On the other hand,
the surface free-energy density is not simple to measure
in experiments but it can be approximately evaluated
by DFT. Together, they provide a variety of quantitative
and high-precision tests between diﬀerent approaches. In
Fig. 13 a draw of the system with its principal lengths
is shown and a single HS particle is included. There, l is
the distance between cups and D is the depth. Lengths
a, b, and d are used to calculate the relevant areas in
Appendix B. This complex-shape conﬁnement includes
rounded-edges as that shown in Fig. 2b. In the analysis
it is adopted the d1-RR point of view. Given a planar
wall of area A0, the number of adsorbed particles per
unit area is simply NA/A0 = ΓA. For a corrugated wall
scratched on the planar wall one deﬁnes the eﬀective ad-

respectively, are both independent of ρ. Also, they are
identical i.e. Γrel = γrel. In Fig. 14 Γrel and γrel are
presented as functions of β and D. In the limit of van-
ishing edge (β → π) they go, naturally, to one. On the
contrary, for very small dihedral angles curves show that
the system desorbs from the corrugated wall (Γrel < 1)
and consistently the relative surface density of free energy
also becomes smaller than one. In the intermediate an-
gular range the relative adsorption (and the relative free
energy) has a peak which becomes more and more pro-
nounced and goes to smaller values of β as D increase.
A cutoﬀ on the conﬁdence of the plotted curves is in-
troduced through the use of stars and triangles. Stars

show the smaller value of β (for each D) beyond that
the ridge and the groove become so nearer that their
interference could be noted (it was estimated using the
condition b > 1). This interference becomes relevant for
corrugated walls with short spatial periodicity length l.
In such case an extra interference term ∆c2 that cou-
ples ridge and groove contributions should be considered.
This term should compensate the divergence of c2 (β) for
very small angles (β → 0). Plotted triangles mark the
smaller value of β (for each D) beyond that one expects
that ∆c2 becomes the relevant term (it was estimated
using the condition b > 0). The evaluation of ∆c2 is
beyond the scope of present work.

VI. FINAL REMARKS

In this work the thermodynamic properties of the con-
ﬁned HS ﬂuid, which is a relevant reference system for
both simple and colloidal ﬂuids, was studied. The HS
ﬂuid was conﬁned in wedges and by edges, and analyzed
in the framework of the activity series expansion for the
grand free energy. The coeﬃcients of these series are the
inhomogeneous version of the Mayer’s cluster integrals,
which decompose linearly in terms of its volume, surface
area, and edges length components. Two diﬀerent type
of edge/wedge conﬁnement were analyzed: the straight-
edge and the rounded-edge.

On the basis of this non-standard approach and using
analytic grounds it was studied in the low density regime
the dependence of the linear-thermodynamic properties
on the dihedral angle. This analysis was done after ob-
taining the functional dependence of the second cluster
integral, τ2, with the dihedral angle for the complete
range 0 < β < 2π and for both types of edges.
In
particular, the second cluster edge component c2(β) was
obtained by applying analytic and numerical integration
schemes, and a statistical-based analysis.

The exact expression for c2(β) was derived in the case
where the center of each particle lies in a straight-edge re-
gion. In addition, accurate analytic expressions for c2(β)
were found in the case of a hard-wall wedge that in-
duce a rounded-edge conﬁnement (π < β < 2π). The
up to present unknown c2(β) allows to obtain the pure
line-tension and line-adsorption of a single edge/wedge
in terms of density power series up to order two. The an-
alytic approach to the edge/wedge conﬁned HS system
was extended to evaluate the mean excess of, adsorbed
density and free-energy density in the neighborhood of
the edge, relative to the planar wall. Both properties ex-
hibit an interesting peak at β ≈ π/6 that corresponds to
a maximum of adsorption and minimum of free-energy.
Furthermore, formulas were also extended to analyze the
HS system conﬁned by a corrugated wall. In this case,
it was observed an interesting non-trivial behavior of the
eﬀective adsorption and eﬀective surface free-energy that
develop an extremum as function of the dihedral angle
and the depth of the corrugation.

Notably, the obtained results for HS are absolute in
the sense that they do not involve any assumption about
approximate equations of state for the bulk system, and
thus, they constitute reference values for the validation
and development of more accurate approximate theories
for inhomogeneous ﬂuid. Further, the expressions found
for c2 of HS suggest that the system of square well parti-
cles may be also studied by a direct extension of the de-
veloped scheme. Finally, concerning the HS system, both
the statistical-based and the MonteCarlo approaches that
were implemented to evaluate c2 are promising to extend
the studies to c3 and c4 (third and fourth cluster inte-
grals).

Appendix A: Mean excess densities ∆ρ and ∆ω for a

single edge/wedge

To obtain the analytic expressions of ∆ρ and ∆ω one
should choose a small and simple region around the apex.
For this region with thickness r one assumes that Ω (r)
and N (r) have a linear form like those given in Eqs. (2,
4), in terms of measures V (r), A (r) and L. Therefore
one ﬁnds

For the straight-edge the adopted region is that part
of a cylinder with radius r and axis on the edge that
intersects A, as can be observed in Fig. 15 ﬁrst row.
Thus, A(r)/V (r) = 4
βr2 . For the
rounded-edge I adopt d1-RR and take the region with
volume V (r) described in Fig. 7 as region II + II ′ + IV
(with depth r in place of σ). Therefore, V (r) =

2 r2i and A (r) = L2r. Note

that the truncated low order density expansion was not
yet introduced in Eqs. (A1, A2). Now, one replaces in
Eq. (A1) [Eq. (A2)] ΓA and ΓL (γ and T ) with the ex-
act expressions up to order ρ2 taken from Eqs. (39, 40).
To ﬁx the value of r one relates it with the range of the
inhomogeneous density proﬁle consistent with the order
ρ2 truncation, i.e. σ. In principle it would be r & σ but
for simplicity It is adopted r = σ. For the straight-edge
one obtains the simple analytic expression

13. The area of the planar wall surface of reference is
A0 = l ∗ Ln where n is the number of grooves separated
by a distance l that will be considered and Ltot = Ln.
This planar wall is transformed to a corrugated wall by
scratching. For the corrugated wall I adopt the d1-RR
[see Eq. (36)] and thus the relevant area A is the area
of the planar part of the gas-wall interface. In terms of
the lengths shown in Fig. 13 it is obtained: A = 2b ∗ Ln
with b = d − a, a = σ cot (β/2), d = D sec (β/2) and
l = 2D tan (β/2). Rearranging these identities one ﬁnds

[c2 is given in Eq. (15)] which is plotted in Fig. 14.

The above adopted region around the apex of the edge
or wedge, is not the unique possible choice. A more subtle
analysis shows that the following more complex alterna-
tive, which modiﬁes V (r) (but not the area A (r) = L2r),
may be better. For the case of a straight-edge the regions
are shown in Fig. 15 second row. One ﬁnds the volume
deﬁnition: If 0 < β < π/2 then V (r) = Lr2 tan (β/2),
if π/2 < β < π then V (r) = Lr2 [2 − cot (β/2)], while
if π < β < 2π then V (r) = Lr2 [2 + β/2]. On the
rounded-edge case, one adopts a region akin that de-
picted in Fig. 7 as region II + II ′ + IV but with II
and II ′ replaced by squares with sides of length r.
It

gives V (r) = Lh β−π

The characteristic lengths used to develop explicit for-

L(cid:17) /γA, in each

case. Note that σ is here related to the external con-
ﬁning potential, it is the minimum enabled distance be-
tween the center of the particle and the substrate. Nat-
urally, for the HS ﬂuid σ is also the pair collision dis-
tance. The two points of view unify when one calls σ
as the particle diameter. Finally, for the HS up to order
ρ2 it is yrel = 8 [c2 (β) + c2 (2π − β)] /π with c2 (β) and
c2 (2π − β) taken from Eqs. (15, 36). This implies that
Xrel becomes independent of ρ.
If the d2-RR is adopted in place of d1-RR, the relevant
area for the corrugated wall turns to be A/Ln = 2b +
σ (π − β) /2 [see Eq.
(38)]. Furthermore, yrel changes
because c2 (2π − β) is that of Eq. (38). These changes
do not modify Xrel and thus Fig. 14 also shows those
results found under the adoption of d2-RR.
