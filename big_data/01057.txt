Amplitude Function of Asymptotic
Correlations Along Charged Wall in
Coulomb Fluids

Received: / Accepted:

Abstract In classical semi-inﬁnite Coulomb ﬂuids, two-point correlation
functions exhibit a slow inverse-power law decay along a uniformly charged
wall. In this work, we concentrate on the corresponding amplitude function
which depends on the distances of the two points from the wall. Recently [L.
ˇSamaj, J. Stat. Phys. 161, 227 (2015)], applying a technique of anticommut-
ing variables to a 2D system of charged rectilinear wall with “counter-ions
only”, we derived a relation between the amplitude function and the den-
sity proﬁle which holds for any temperature. In this paper, using the M¨obius
conformal transformation of particle coordinates in a disc, a new relation be-
tween the amplitude function and the density proﬁle is found for that model.
This enables us to prove, at any temperature, the factorization property of
the amplitude function in point distances from the wall and to express it in
terms of the density proﬁle. Presupposing the factorization property of the
amplitude function and using speciﬁc sum rules for semi-inﬁnite geometries, a
relation between the amplitude function of the charge-charge structure func-
tion and the charge proﬁle is derived for many-component Coulomb ﬂuids in
any dimension.

1 Introduction

The topic of interest in this paper is the equilibrium statistical mechan-
ics of classical Coulomb ﬂuids which consist in mobile charges and perhaps
ﬁxed surface or volume charge densities, the system as a whole being elec-
troneutral. The charged entities interact by the Coulomb potential whose

form depends on the manifold in which the system is formulated. For an in-
ﬁnite d-dimensional Euclidean space, the electrostatic potential v at a point
r ∈ Rd, induced by a unit charge at the origin 0, is the solution of the Poisson
equation
(1.1)

∆v(r) = −sdδ(r),

where sd is the surface area of the unit sphere in d dimensions: s2 = 2π, s3 =
4π, etc. This d-dimensional deﬁnition of the Coulomb potential maintains
generic properties of “real” 3D Coulomb systems with v(r) = 1/r, r = |r|.
In 2D, the solution of (1.1), subject to the boundary condition ∇v(r) → 0 as
r → ∞, reads as v(r) = − ln(r/L) where the scale L is free. For d ≥ 3, we
have v(r) = 1/rd−2.
In standard “dense” Coulomb ﬂuids like the one-component plasma (jel-
lium with a neutralizing bulk background) and the two-component plasma
(Coulomb gas of ± charges), the number of mobile charges is proportional
to the volume of the conﬁning domain. Such systems exhibit good screening
properties and their bulk two-point correlations have a short-ranged decay.
There exist many exact sum rules which relate the particle one-body and
two-body densities, in the bulk, semi-inﬁnite and ﬁnite geometries, see re-
view [20].

In “sparse” Coulomb systems of charged macromolecule surfaces, the
number of identical mobile charges (coined as counter-ions) is proportional
to the charged surface boundary from which they are released [3,10,21].
The high-temperature (weak-coupling) limit is described by the Poisson-
Boltzmann (PB) theory [1] and by its systematic improvement via the loop
expansion [2,22,24]. The low-temperature (strong-coupling) limit is more
controversial, the single-particle picture of counter-ions in the linear surface-
charge potential appears in the leading strong-coupling order, see e.g. [5,18,
19,23,29]. In spite of the fact that sparse Coulomb ﬂuids have poor screening
properties, the standard sum rules hold in semi-inﬁnite and ﬁnite geometries
[31,32,33].

In semi-inﬁnite geometry of an electric double layer, the screening cloud
around a particle sitting near hard wall is asymmetric and therefore two-point
correlations decay slowly as an inverse-power law along the wall [11,12,35].
The corresponding amplitude function, which depends on the distances of the
two points from the wall, satisﬁes a sum rule [12,15,28]. A relation between
the amplitude function and the dipole moment was found in Ref. [16]. The
contribution of the long-ranged charge-charge correlations along a domain
boundary, together with a bulk contribution, explains the dependence of
the dielectric susceptibility tensor on the shape of the conﬁning domain, in
the thermodynamic limit, as required by macroscopic electrostatics [6,7,8].
Interestingly, in all exactly solvable cases the amplitude function factorizes
itself in the two point distances from the wall.

In a recent paper about 2D charged rectilinear wall with counter-ions only
[33], we used a technique of anticommuting variables [25] to derive a relation
between the amplitude function and the density proﬁle which holds for any
coupling (temperature) of the ﬂuid regime. Moreover, using the M¨obius con-
formal transformation of particle coordinates in the partition function for a
disc geometry, an exact formula for the dielectric susceptibility tensor was

3

derived. Since this tensor contains also long-ranged correlations along the
wall, it is likely that a more detailed exploration of the M¨obius conformal
transformation might reveal another relation between the amplitude function
and the density proﬁle which is complementary to the one derived in Ref.
[33].

In this paper, using the formalism of anticommuting variables, we repeat
the M¨obius conformal transformation of particle coordinates on the level of
the partition function and one-body density (Sect. 2). In this way, we derive
a new relation between the amplitude function and the density proﬁle (Sect.
3). This enables us to prove the factorization property of the amplitude
function for any temperature, at least for the simpliﬁed 2D model of the
charged line with counter-ions only. The amplitude function is subsequently
expressed locally in terms of the density proﬁle. In Sect. 4, a relation of
our result to the sum rule obtained by Blum et al. [4] enables us to extend
the analysis to one-component jellium. The generalization of the formalism
to charge-charge structure function of many-component Coulomb ﬂuids in
any dimension is presented in Sect. 5. Here, presupposing the factorization
property of the amplitude function, its explicit relation to the charge density
proﬁle is established. A short recapitulation and conclusions are drawn in
Sect. 6.

2 2D charged rectilinear wall with counter-ions only

We consider a system of N identical pointlike particles of elementary charge
−e conﬁned to a 2D domain D of points r = (x, y). The system is studied
within the canonical ensemble at the inverse temperature β = 1/(kBT ). The
particle interaction part of the energy reads −e2PN
(i<j)=1 ln|ri − rj|, where
the free length scale L is set to unity. The one-body Boltzmann factor w(r) =
exp[−βu(r)] involves all external potentials (e.g. due to a neutralizing bulk
or surface background) acting on particles. Introducing the coupling constant
Γ ≡ 2γ = βe2, the partition function is given by
Y(i<j)=1

where we omit irrelevant constant prefactors.

The one-body density of particles at point r ∈ D is deﬁned by

N

n(r) = hˆn(r)i,

ˆn(r) =

δ(r − ri),

(2.2)

Xi=1

where ˆn(r) is the microscopic density of particles and h···i denotes the sta-
tistical average over canonical ensemble. The corresponding averaged charge
density is simply ρ(r) = −en(r). At two-particle level, one introduces the
two-body densities

n2(r, r′) =* N
X(i6=j)=1

δ(r − ri)δ(r′ − rj)+ .

(2.3)

The one-body and two-body densities can be obtained from the partition
function (2.1) in the standard way as the functional derivatives:

(2.4)

(2.5)

The two-body densities n2(r, r′) decouple to the product of densities n(r)
and n(r′) at asymptotically large distances |r−r′| → ∞. Therefore it is useful
to introduce the (truncated) Ursell functions

(2.6)
which vanish at |r − r′| → ∞. For one-component systems of particles of
charge −e, the charge-charge structure function is deﬁned as

U (r, r′) = n2(r, r′) − n(r)n(r′)

S(r, r′) = e2 [hˆn(r)ˆn(r′)i − n(r)n(r′)]
= e2 [U (r, r′) + n(r)δ(r − r′)] .

(2.7)

The structure and Ursell functions diﬀer from one another by a term which
is nonzero only if the two points merge, i.e.

U (r, r′) =

S(r, r′)

e2

if r 6= r′.

(2.8)

For any ﬁnite or inﬁnite domain D, the structure function satisﬁes the zeroth-
moment sum rule [20]

d2r′ S(r, r′) = 0.

2.1 Formalism of anticommuting variables

The formalism of anticommuting variables for 2D one-component plasmas has
been introduced in Ref. [25] and developed further in Refs. [26,27,30,31,32].
For γ a positive integer, the partition function (2.1) can be expressed in terms
of two sets of anticommuting variables {ξ(α)
i } each with γ components
(α = 1, . . . , γ), deﬁned on a discrete chain of N sites i = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1, as

Next we consider the disc domain D = {r,|r| ≤ R} with a constant

of the electroneutrality ﬁxes the number of counter-ions with charge −e to
N = 2πRσ. For this model, we have w(z, ¯z) ≡ w(r) = 1 [33] and

2.2 Conformal transformation

We consider the particles with complex coordinates (z, ¯z) inside the disc
domain D = {(z, ¯z), z ¯z ≤ R2}. The M¨obius conformal transformation

z′ =

z + Ra
1 + z¯a
R

,

z =

z′ − Ra
1 − z ′¯a

R

(2.19)

6

(with a free complex parameter a such that a¯a 6= 1) transforms the parti-
cle coordinates in the disc domain D to another domain D′ deﬁned by the
inequality

(R2 − z′¯z′)(1 − a¯a) ≥ 0.

(2.20)

If a is chosen such that a¯a < 1, the original disc domain D is mapped onto
itself, D′ = D. Note that a = 0 corresponds to the identity transformation.

2.2.1 Partition function

n(z, ¯z)dzd¯z = na(z′, ¯z′)dz′d¯z′.

(2.30)

Note that this relation, when integrated over the disk domain D, ensures the
conservation of the total number of particles under the conformal transfor-
mation. Equivalently,

3 Derivation of sum rules

In this part, we use the above exact relations between the original and trans-
formed partition functions and particle densities to derive certain sum rules.

8

3.1 Partition function

We start with the equality of the original and transformed partition func-
tions, see Eqs. (2.28) and (2.29). First we expand the transformed interaction
matrix (2.27) in linear a, ¯a and quadratic a¯a terms:

(3.1)
where wi are the original interaction strengths (2.15). The corresponding
expansion of the transformed action (2.26) around the original action (2.16)
reads as

Inserting this expansion into Eq. (2.29) and expanding the exponential in a,

This sum rule has already been derived in connection with the calculation
of the dielectric susceptibility tensor, see Eq. (6.10) of Ref. [33]. The same
equality holds for the truncated correlator hˆn(r)ˆn(r′)i − n(r)n(r′) since

In the density relation (2.33), we expand up to terms linear in a and ¯a the
transformed coordinates

z′ = z + Ra −

This equation can be checked on two exactly solvable 2D cases of the
present counter-ion system [33]. The PB Γ → 0 limit yields f (x, x′) of the

At Γ = 2, we have f (x, x′) of the short-range form [13,31]

It is easy to verify that both exact solutions fulﬁll our Eq. (3.21).

3.3 Properties of the amplitude f -function

Now we aim at showing fundamental properties of the f -functions following
from Eq. (3.21).

It is known that in 2D the function f (x, x′) obeys the sum rule [12,15,

Applying the integration operation R ∞

.

Taking x = 0 in (3.21) and using the symmetry f (x, x′) = f (x′, x), the
f -function with both points at the x = x′ = 0 boundary is given by

f (0, 0) = −2Γ σ2.

(3.26)

As a check, the exactly solvable Γ → 0 limit (3.22) and Γ = 2 case (3.23)
satisfy this relation.
The function f (x, x′) is assumed to be an analytic holomorphic function
of its arguments. Therefore, when deriving both sides of the relation (3.21)
with respect to x, one can interchange the integration and derivation [34] to
obtain

(3.27)

The two Eqs. (3.21) and (3.27) can be fulﬁlled simultaneously only if

∂f (x, x′)

∂x

= h(x)f (x, x′)

with some unknown function h(x). Equivalently,

∂
∂x

ln [−f (x, x′)] = h(x).

(3.28)

(3.29)

12

Taking into account the symmetry relation f (x, x′) = f (x′, x), this PDE has
the unique solution

ln [−f (x, x′)] =Z dx h(x) +Z dx′ h(x′).

Consequently, the function f (x, x′) factorizes as follows

f (x, x′) = −g(x)g(x′),

g(x) = exp(cid:20)Z dx h(x)(cid:21) .

(3.30)

(3.31)

The factorization property of f (x, x′), seen in the Γ → 0 limit (3.22) and at
Γ = 2 (3.23), thus extends to any value of Γ .
Due to the factorization property, the density proﬁle n(x) determines the

function f (x, x′) as follows

f (x, x′) = −

where we used the integration by parts for x∂n(x)/∂x, the known fact that
n(x) goes to 0 faster than 1/x as x → ∞ and the electroneutrality condition.

4 Another approach to one-component systems

4.1 Counter-ions only

There exists an alternative way how to derive in the 2D case with counter-
ions only the important relation (3.19). In 2D, the coupling constant Γ = βe2
is dimensionless. The particle density n has dimension [length]−2 and the
surface charge density σ has dimension [length]−1, so one can write

n(x; σ) = σ2t(σx),

(4.1)

where t is an unknown function. For this scaling form of the density proﬁle,
we obtain the equality

σ

∂n(x)

∂σ

= 2σ2t(σx) + σ3xt′(σx) = 2n(x) + x

∂n(x)

.

(4.2)

Blum et al. [4] derived a sum rule which relates the variation of the particle
density n(x) with respect to the surface charge density to the dipole moment
seen by a ﬁxed particle. In 2D, the sum rule reads as

With the aid of the relations (3.18) and (4.2), we recover Eq. (3.19).

We can go to higher dimensions d within the present approach. The d-

We cannot prove in general the factorization property (3.31) of the func-
tion f (x, x′) in dimensions d ≥ 3 since we miss a relation like the 2D one
(3.20) derived for any temperature in Ref. [33]. Let us suppose that the fac-
torization property takes place, i.e. f (x, x′) = −g(x)g(x′), and apply the
present formalism to obtain g(x). The generalization of the 2D sum rule
(3.24) to any dimension d reads as

i.e. for every distance x from the wall the function g(x) is expressible locally in

consistent since the integration of Eq. (4.10) over x from 0 to ∞ reduces to
(4.9) due to the electroneutrality condition R ∞

4.2 Jellium model

The relation (4.10) in fact holds for an arbitrary one-component system
whose f (x, x′)-function factorizes into −g(x)g(x′). Here, we present the jel-
lium model of mobile pointlike particles with charge −e immersed in a homo-
geneous (bulk) background of density n0 and charge density en0. The system
is constrained to the d-dimensional Euclidean half-space of points r = (x, y)
with y = (y1, . . . , yd−1), the coordinates yi ∈ (−∞,∞) and x ≥ 0. There is a
plane charged by a constant surface charge density σe at x = 0. The density
proﬁle n(x) and the function f (x, x′) were calculated exactly in two cases.

The high-temperature Debye-H¨uckel (linearized PB) theory in d dimen-

sions [11] yields the density proﬁle

n(x, σ) = n(x, σ = 0) + σκe−κx,

(4.12)

where κ =psdβe2n0 is the inverse Debye length. The asymptotic |y| = y →

With regard to the equality ∂n(x)/∂σ = κe−κx, it is easy to verify that this
g-function satisﬁes Eq. (4.10).

The other exactly solvable case is the 2D jellium at coupling Γ = 2. The

5 A generalization to many-component Coulomb systems

Now let us consider a general Coulomb system which consists of s species of
particles α = 1, . . . , s with the corresponding charges qαe (qα is the valence
and e the elementary charge), plus perhaps a ﬁxed background of density
n0 and charge density ρ0 = en0. As before, the particles are constrained
to the d-dimensional Euclidean half-space of points r = (x, y) with x ≥ 0.
There is a plane charged by a constant surface charge density σe at x =
0. The microscopic density of particles of species α is given by ˆnα(r) =

Pi δα,αiδ(r−ri), where i indexes the charged particles. The total microscopic
charge density reads as ˆρ(r) = ρ0 +Pα qαeˆnα(r). For the present geometry,
the averaged charge density depends only on the x-coordinate, ρ(x) = hˆρ(r)i.
The charge-charge structure function, deﬁned by

(5.1)
depends on coordinates x, x′ and on the lateral distance y = |y − r′|,
S(x, x′; y). The asymptotic large-y behavior is of the form

S(r, r′) ≡ hˆρ(r)ˆρ(r′)i − hˆρ(r)ihˆρ(r′)i,

S(x, x′; y) ≃y→∞

For the previous one-component system of particles with charge −e, F (x, x′)
is related to f (x, x′) by F (x, x′) = e2f (x, x′). The counterpart of the one-

5.1 Exactly solvable cases

In the Debye-H¨uckel high-temperature limit [11], the charge density proﬁle
takes the form

ρ(x, σ) = ρ(x, σ = 0) − eσκe−κx,

(5.9)

The asymptotic amplitude function F (x, x′) was found in the form

αnα is the multi-component inverse Debye length.

Since ∂ρ(x)/∂(σe) = −κe−κx, it is trivial to verify that this G-function
satisﬁes Eq. (5.8).
Another exactly solvable case is the 2D two-component plasma (Coulomb
gas) of ±e charges at coupling Γ = 2 [9,14]. The density proﬁles of ±e
particles read as

6 Conclusion

This paper was motivated by the previous one [33] where, using the technique
of anticommuting variables for a 2D model of the charged wall with counter-
ions only, a new relation was found between the amplitude function f (x, x′)
(with x′ = 0) of the asymptotic decay of two-body densities along the wall
and the particle density proﬁle n(x), see Eq. (3.20). Here in Sect. 2, using
the M¨obius conformal transformation of particle coordinates on the level of
one-body density for the same model, the complementary relation (3.19) was
derived. The combination of the two exact relations enabled us to prove the
factorization property f (x, x′) = −g(x)g(x′) and to express g(x) in terms of
the density proﬁle.
For more-complicated many-component Coulomb ﬂuids in any dimension,
it is necessary to concentrate on the charge-charge structure function (5.1)
with the asymptotic behavior (5.2) and to look on the relation between the
amplitude function F (x, x′) and the charge density proﬁle ρ(x). In all exactly
solvable cases which are available in the high-temperature limit and at the
2D free-fermion coupling, the amplitude function F (x, x′) factorizes. There is
no proof of the factorization property of the amplitude function at any tem-
perature. In general, the statistical independence of two particles at asymp-
totically large distances is reﬂected by the nullity of the truncated correlation
functions. In our semi-inﬁnite problem, the distance between two particles
goes to inﬁnity along the wall, y → ∞, but the distances of the particles from
the wall x, x′ are ﬁnite. One can intuitively argue that the limit y → ∞ auto-
matically decouples the subspaces x and x′ which is behind the factorization
property of the amplitude function. Presupposing F (x, x′) = −G(x)G(x′) for
any Coulomb ﬂuid, the combination of two sum rules (5.4) and (5.5) permits
us to express G(x) in terms of the charge density proﬁle ρ(x), see Eq. (5.8).
As concerns future perspective, it would be desirable to ﬁnd simpliﬁed
models or new methods to prove the factorization property of the amplitude
function for more general Coulomb ﬂuids. A better comprehension of the form
of the amplitude function might clarify the form of the dielectric susceptibility
tensor for an arbitrarily shaped domain.
