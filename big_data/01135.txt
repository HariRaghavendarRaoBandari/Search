Abstract. Tropical Nevanlinna theory studies value distribution of contin-
uous piecewise linear functions of a real variable. In this paper, we use the
reasoning from tropical Nevanlinna theory to present tropical counterparts
of some classical complex results related to Fermat type equations, Hayman
conjecture and Br¨uck conjecture.

1. Introduction

Tropical Nevanlinna theory may be understood as a cross-road between tropical
mathematics and the classical Nevanlinna theory, see [16] for a general background
of tropical mathematics and [7], [11] and [12] for the tropical setting of the Nevan-
linna theory. Indeed, tropical Nevanlinna theory provides the ﬂexibility of applying
complex analysis methods to considering real functions. Recall that Halburd and
Southall [7] described continuous piecewise linear functions on R with one-side inte-
ger derivatives as tropical meromorphic functions, and established tropical versions
of the ﬁrst main theorem and the lemma on the logarithmic derivative. Laine and
Tohge [12] then showed that tropical Nevanlinna theory also holds to piecewise
linear functions with arbitrary real slopes, and obtained a tropical version of the
second main theorem.

Tropical Nevanlinna theory actually opens up possibilities for further investiga-
tions on value distribution and uniqueness theory of tropical meromorphic func-
tions.
In this paper, we shall consider tropical meromorphic solutions y(x) to
discrete equations of type

qXj=0

njy(x + j) = 1,

where the coeﬃcients nj are integers and q = 1, 2, 3. These considerations present,
in some sense, tropical variants of some classical complex analysis topics such as
Fermat type equations, a conjecture proposed to Hayman, and Br¨uck conjecture
type results. For the convenience of the reader, we shortly describe the respec-
tive complex analysis background before proceeding to the corresponding tropical
reasoning.

Recall that we are considering, throughout, a max-plus semi-ring endowing R ∪

{−∞} with tropical addition

and tropical multiplication

x ⊕ y := max(x, y)

x ⊗ y := x + y.

We also use x ⊘ y := x − y and x⊗α = αx, for α ∈ R. The identity element 0◦
for tropical addition is 0◦ = −∞ and the identity element 1◦ for multiplication is
1◦ = 0. Such a structure is not a ring, for not all elements have tropical additive
inverses.

Assume that the reader is familiar with the basic notations and results of the
tropical Nevanlinna theory, see e.g. [11] and [12]. However, for the convenience of
the reader, we recall here the following basic notations.

Deﬁnition 1.1. [7] Let f (x) be a tropical meromorphic function and

(1.1)

ωf (x0) = lim
ε→0+

[f ′(x0 + ε) − f ′(x0 − ε)].

If ωf (x0) > 0, then x0 is called the root (zero) of f (x) with multiplicity ωf (x0). If
ωf (x0) < 0, then x0 is called the pole of f (x) with multiplicity −ωf (x0).

The tropical proximity function for tropical meromorphic functions is deﬁned as

(1.2)

m(r, f ) :=

1

2(cid:0)f +(r) + f +(−r)(cid:1) ,

where f +(r) := max{f (x), 0} for x ∈ R. The tropical counting function for poles
in (−r, r) is deﬁned as

(1.3)

N (r, f ) :=

1

2Z r

n(t, f )dt =

1

2 X|bν |<r

τf (bν)(r − |bν|),

0

where n(t, f ) is the number of distinct poles of f in the interval (−r, r), each pole
multiplied by its multiplicity τf . The tropical characteristic function T (r, f ) :=
m(r, f ) + N (r, f ). Following the usual classical notation, deﬁne the order of f (x)
as

and the hyper-order of f (x) by

ρ(f ) := lim sup

r→∞

log T (r, f )

,

log r

ρ2(f ) := lim sup
r→∞

log log T (r, f )

log r

.

In this paper, we typically need to work with tropical 1-periodic meromorphic
functions Π(x) and with tropical exponential functions. Concerning 1-periodic func-
tions, recall their representation in terms of the sawtooth functions

π(a,b)(x) :=

1

a + b

see [11], Theorem 6.7.

min{a(x − [x]), −b((x − [x]) − 1)},

a, b > 0,

In what follows, we frequently shorten the notations by using the notations

Π(x), Πj (x),eΠ(x),bΠ(x) etc. for tropical meromorphic functions of period 1, possi-

bly meaning diﬀerent functions at diﬀerent occasions. In particular, such notations
may be used to point out several independent 1-periodic functions are to be con-
sidered simultaneously. We can also write Π(x) + Π(x) = Π(x), cΠ(x) = Π(x),

TROPICAL VARIANTS OF SOME COMPLEX ANALYSIS RESULTS

3

etc. We also use the notation Ξ(x) to denote tropical meromorphic functions that
are 2-periodic and anti-1-periodic, again possibly meaning diﬀerent functions at
diﬀerent occasions.

Concerning tropical exponential functions, recall ﬁrst their deﬁnitions, see [11],

Section 1.2.4:

eα(x) := α[x](x − [x]) +

[x]−1Xj=−∞

αj = α[x](cid:18)x − [x] +

1

α − 1(cid:19) ,

where |α| > 1 is a real number. In this case, eα(x) is strictly increasing, and eα(x)
is a tropical entire function, since it has no poles. If then |β| < 1, β 6= 0, we deﬁne

eβ(x) :=

∞Xj=[x]

βj − β[x](x − [x]) = β[x](cid:18) 1

1 − β

− x + [x](cid:19) .

If 0 < β < 1, eβ(x) is a tropical entire function as well. However, if β < −1, then
eβ(x) is tropical meromorphic, but not tropical entire. For more details concerning
tropical exponential functions, see [11], Section 1.2.4.
In particular, note that
tropical exponentials y(x) := eα(x) satisfy the equation y(x + 1) = y(x)⊗α(=
αy(x)), for all α 6= 0, 1.

2. Fermat type equations in the tropical setting

The classical Fermat last theorem that equation xn + yn = 1 has no non-
trivial rational solutions, when n ≥ 3, had been proved, after three centuries, by
Wiles in [19], see also [17].

Considering x, y in xn + yn = 1 as elements in function ﬁelds, we land at looking
equations that may be called as Fermat type functional equations. As to meromor-
phic solutions to the most simple case

(2.1)

f (z)n + g(z)n = 1,

it is known that (2.1) has no transcendental meromorphic solutions when n ≥ 4,
while for n = 2, 3 such meromorphic solutions are easy to ﬁnd.

As to meromorphic solutions of the more general case

(2.2)

f (z)n + g(z)n + h(z)n = 1,

it is known that meromorphic solutions f, g, h may be found for n ≤ 6, see [5], [6],
and the references therein, while for n ≥ 9 no such meromorphic solutions exist.
This non-existence result has been proved by Hayman in [9], where a detailed
presentation for the more general situation

(2.3)

nXj=1

fj(z)k = 1

is to be found. Observe that the cases n = 7, 8 remain open for (2.2).

We now proceed to considering certain Fermat type functional equations in the
tropical setting. Concerning the most simple case (2.1), one clearly gets two corre-
sponding tropical equations, namely

(2.4)

and

(2.5)

f (x)⊗k ⊕ g(x)⊗k = 1

f (x)⊗k ⊗ g(x)⊗k = 1,

4

K. LIU, I. LAINE, AND K. TOHGE

asking in both case possible tropical meromorphic solutions f and g, provided that
k is a natural number. However, as we are treating tropical meromorphic functions
with real slopes, it would be natural to consider

(2.6)

and

(2.7)

f (x)⊗α ⊕ g(x)⊗β = 1

f (x)⊗α ⊗ g(x)⊗β = 1,

where α, β are real numbers.

Before proceeding, recall that tropical polynomials are tropical meromorphic
functions that admit ﬁnitely many roots and no poles. Equivalently, tropical poly-
nomials may be represented in the form

(2.8) f (x) =

nMi=0

(ai⊗x⊗si ) = an⊗x⊗sn ⊕an−1⊗x⊗sn−1 ⊕· · ·⊕a1⊗x⊗s1 ⊕a0⊗x⊗s0 ,

where the coeﬃcients ai are constants and si are real numbers, i = 0, 1, 2, · · · , n
and s0 < s1 < · · · < sn. Evaluating tropical polynomials in the classical notation
results in

(2.9)

f (x) = max{an + snx, an−1 + sn−1x, · · · , a1 + s1x, a0 + s0x}.

More generally, tropical meromorphic functions that admit no poles, may be

called as tropical entire functions, and they have a series expansion
(2.10)

(an ⊗x⊗sn ) = a0 ⊗x⊗s0 ⊕a1 ⊗x⊗s1 ⊕· · ·⊕an−1 ⊗x⊗sn−1 ⊕an ⊗x⊗sn · · · ,

∞Mn=0

f (x) =

that is,

(2.11)

f (x) = max

{an + snx},

n∈Z+∪{0}

where the exponents sn are real numbers and s0 < s1 < · · · < sn < · · · , see [11,
Chapter 2].

Remark 2.1. To start with, observe that equation

f (x)⊗k ⊕ g(x)⊗k = 1,

where k is a natural number, admits no non-constant tropical entire solutions. In-
deed, suppose that one of f, g, say f , is non-constant.
If f now has no slope
discontinuities, then kf (x) > 1 for some points x with |x| large enough, a contra-
diction. Let then x0 be a slope discontinuity of f , and consider the slopes sj0−1
and sj0 on both sides of x0. Since f has no poles, we have sj0 − sj0−1 > 0. If
sj0 > 0, then kf (x) ≥ kf (x0) + sj0(x − x0) for all x > x0, hence kf (x) > 1 for all
x large enough, a contradiction. If then sj0 ≤ 0, we have sj0−1 < 0, and we have
kf (x) ≥ kf (x0) + sj0−1(x − x0) for all x < x0, and so kf (x) > 1 for all x with
|x| large enough, again a contradiction. On the other hand, tropical meromorphic,
non-entire solutions are immediate to ﬁnd. As a trivial example, take k = 1. Then
f (x) := min(1, −x + 2) and g(x) := min(1, x) are solutions to f (x) ⊕ g(x) = 1.

The reasoning used in the remark above applies to prove the following more

general case.

Theorem 2.2. There are no non-constant tropical entire functions f1, . . . , fn that
satisfy

(2.12)

nMj=1

fj(z)⊗αj = 1,

where the exponents α1, . . . , αn all are positive.

Proof. Applying the reasoning in used in the preceding remark, it is immediate to
see that a contradiction readily follows whenever one of the functions f1, . . . , fn is
tropical entire and non-constant.
(cid:3)

Remark 2.3. Of course, the same result follows whenever the exponents α1, . . . , αn
all are negative. However, if there are diﬀerent signs among the exponents α1, . . . , αn,
the claim obviously fails. Take, e.g., f (x) = 1
β ) with
α > 0, β < 0. Then we have f (x)⊗α ⊕ g(x)⊗β = 1. Observe that −g(x) is not a
tropical entire function.

α and g(x) = 1

β ⊕ (x ⊗ 1

Remark 2.4. Again, it is immediate to observe that equation (2.12) always admits
non-trivial tropical meromorphic solutions. Suppose again, for simplicity, that the
exponents α1, . . . , αn all are positive. Taking now f1 := 1
min(1, −x + 2), f2 :=
α1
1
α2

min(1, x) and max(f3, . . . , fn) ≤ min(f1, f2), a solution f1, . . . , fn is at hand.

We next proceed to considering tropical meromorphic solutions to equation

(2.13)

f (x)⊗α ⊗ g(x)⊗β = 1

with real exponents α, β.
It is trivial to ﬁnd f , g satisfying (2.13) for any α, β.
Indeed, we may take, for example, f (x) = x ⊗ 1
β . However,
ﬁnding expressions for general solutions seems to be more complicated, and we are
restricting ourselves to considering equations that may be called tropical diﬀerence
Fermat type functional equations. Such an equation corresponding to (2.13) is

α and g(x) = x⊗− α

(2.14)

f (x)⊗α ⊗ f (x + 1)⊗β = 1,

where α, β are real numbers, hence

(2.15)

αf (x) + βf (x + 1) = 1.

The key parts of this paper are then treating similar equations

(2.16)

with s = 2 and s = 3.

sXj=0

njf (x + j) = 1

The remaining of the paper is now being organized as follows. In Section 3 we
collect a number of propositions that are either needed in the subsequent consid-
erations, or might appear useful in future considerations. In Section 4, equation
(2.16), i.e. the case s = 1, is shortly treated, while the next Section 5 is devoted
to considering tropical diﬀerence Fermat type equations (2.16) with s = 2. Section
6 is then treating, partially, the case s = 3. The last two sections are describing
tropical counterparts to the Hayman conjecture from complex analysis (Section 7)
and the Br¨uck conjecture (Section 8).

3. Preliminary propositions

We start this section by recalling the following theorem, see [11], Theorem 7.3
and Theorem 7.4 (and making use of the identity ec(x + 1) = cec(x)). Observe that
this version is formulated for our subsequent needs.

Theorem 3.1. The equation

(3.1)

y(x + 1) = y(x)⊗c

with c ∈ R\{0} admits non-constant tropical meromorphic solutions on R of hyper-
order ρ2(f ) < 1 if and only if c = ±1. Moreover, if f (x) is a non-constant tropical
meromorphic solution to (3.1), then the following representations follow:

(1) If c = 1, then f (x) is 1-periodic. Hence,

f (x) = Π(x).

(2) If c = −1, then f (x) is 2-periodic, anti-1-periodic. Hence

f (x) = Ξ(x).

(3) If c 6= ±1, then all solutions of (3.1) are ﬁnite linear combinations of tropical

exponentials of type f (x) = ec(x − b), where b ∈ [0, 1).

combinations Pq

Remark 3.2. In what follows, we use the notation Lb(ec(x − b)) for ﬁnite linear
j=1 βjec(x − bj), where c is ﬁxed and b = {b1, . . . , bq} ⊂ [0, 1). In
particular, if A is a constant, then Lb(Aec(x − b)) = Lb(ec(x − b)), since, ec(x +
1 − b) = cec(x − b), Lb(ec(x + 1 − b)) = Lb(ec(x − b)).

Proposition 3.3. All tropical meromorphic solutions to

f (x + 1) − f (x) = c,

c ∈ R,

are of the form f (x) = Π(x) + cx.

Remark 3.4. As for the trivial proof of this proposition, see [11], p. 157.

In what follows, we use the notation Π0 for 1-periodic tropical meromorphic

functions that satisfy Π0(0) = 0.

Proposition 3.5. All tropical meromorphic solutions to

(3.2)

take the form

(3.3)

where

(3.4)

f (x + 1) − f (x) = Π0(x),

f (x) = Π(x) + Φ(x, Π0)

Φ(x, Π0) := [x]Π0(x).

Proof. It is straightforward to see that Φ(x + 1, Π0) − Φ(x, Π0) = Π0(x). There-
fore, Φ(x, Π0) is a special solution to (3.2). It remains to verify that Φ(x, Π0) is
continuous and piecewise linear; this is immediate. On the other hand, if F (x)
is an arbitrary solution to (3.2), then it is trivial to see that F (x) − Φ(x, Π0) is
1-periodic.

Corollary 3.6. All tropical meromorphic solutions to

(3.5)

f (x + 1) − f (x) = Π(x),

where Π is 1-periodic tropical meromorphic such that Π(0) = d, take the form

(3.6)

where

(3.7)

f (x) = eΠ(x) + Φ(x, Π) + dx

Φ(x, Π) := [x](Π(x) − d).

Remark 3.7. Observe that Remark 7.2 in [11] fails by Proposition 3.5. Note that
xΠ0(x) satisﬁes equation (3.2), and therefore, g(x) := xΠ0(x) − (Φ(x, Π0)) is 1-
periodic. However, xΠ0(x) is not tropical meromorphic by its non-linearity, hence
g(x) is not tropical meromorphic as well. Moreover, we remark here that Theorem
7.7 in [11] becomes incomplete, see Theorem 5.1(1) below.

As an illustration, see the graph of Φ(x, Π0) in Fig 1, when Π0(x) = π(1,1)(x).

Proposition 3.8. All tropical meromorphic solutions to

(3.8)

f (x + 1) − f (x) = Φ(x, Π0),

with the 1-periodic function Φ(x, Π0) := [x]Π0(x) deﬁned as in Proposition 3.5, take
the form

Θ(x, Π0) := (1 +

)Π0(x).

Proof. This is an elementary computation.

(cid:3)

To illustrate the situation, look at the graph of Θ(x, Π0) in Fig 2, with Π0(x) =

π(1,1)(x) again.

Corollary 3.9. All tropical meromorphic solutions to

(3.11)

f (x + 1) − f (x) = Φ(x, Π)

with the 1-periodic function Φ(x, Π) := [x](Π(x) − Π(0)) deﬁned as in Corollary
3.6, take the form

meromorphic functions such that Ξ0(0) = 0. We now proceed to prove

(3.18)

satisfy

(3.19)

f (x + 1) + f (x) = Ξ0(x)

f (x) = Ξ(x) − [x]Ξ0(x).

Proof. Elementary computation again veriﬁes that −[x]Ξ0(x) is a special solution
to (3.18). Moreover, if F (x) is an arbitrary solution to (3.18), it is an easy exercise
to see that F (x) + [x]Ξ0(x) is an anti-1-periodic, 2-periodic tropical meromorphic
function.

As for the general case eΞ(x) of anti-1-periodic, 2-periodic tropical meromorphic
exists x0 such that eΞ(x0) = 0. Therefore, we obtain
f (x + 1) + f (x) = eΞ(x),
f (x) = Ξ(x) − [x − x0]eΞ(x).

such that eΞ(x0) = 0, take the form
Proof. Deﬁning fΞ0(x) := eΞ(x + x0) and g(x) := f (x + x0), equation (3.20) takes

g(x + 1) + g(x) = fΞ0(x),

hence

g(x) = Ξ(x) − [x]fΞ0(x) = Ξ(x) − [x]eΞ(x + x0),

f (x + 1) + f (x) = Π(x),

where Π(x) is tropical meromorphic and 1-periodic, are of the form f (x) = Ξ(x) +

Proof. Clearly, the solutions to f (x + 1) + f (x) = 0 are 2-periodic, anti-1-periodic

Proposition 3.17. Provided a 6= α, all tropical meromorphic solutions to

f (x + 1) − af (x) = eα(x)

Proof. To determine the special solution of the form Keα(x), it is suﬃcient to
substitute this into f (x + 1) − af (x) = eα(x), and recall that eα(x + 1) = αeα(x).
Moreover, if F (x) is an arbitrary tropical meromorphic solution to f (x+1)−af (x) =
eα(x), then an elementary computation shows that G(x) := F (x) − 1
α−a eα(x) sat-
isﬁes G(x + 1) − aG(x) = 0.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.18. Clearly, all tropical meromorphic solutions to

f (x + 1) − af (x) = Aeα(x)

with a constant multiplier A are of the form f (x) = G(x) + A

α−a eα(x).

Proposition 3.19. Provided that |α| 6= 1, and that α < 0, then all tropical mero-
morphic solutions to

f (x + 1) − αf (x) = eα(x)

are of the form f (x) = Lb(eα(x − b)) + 1

α [x − x0]eα(x), where eα(x0) = 0.

Proof. It is an easy observation to see that [x − x0]eα(x) is tropical meromorphic.
What remains is a trivial computation.

1−α ∈ (0, 1) in this propo-
sition. Indeed, all roots of the tropical exponential eα(x) form the set x0 + Z. If
now x1, x2 ∈ x0 + Z, then their diﬀerence is a solution to f (x + 1) − αf (x) = 0 as
one may immediately see.

Remark 3.21. It remains open whether equation f (x + 1) − αf (x) = eα(x) admits
tropical meromorphic solutions, if |α| 6= 1, and α > 0.
Indeed, if f is such a
solution, then f (x + 2) − 2αf (x + 1) + α2f (x) = 0. By Theorem 5.1(4), f (x) ∈
Lb(eα(x − b)) are solutions to f (x + 2) − 2αf (x + 1) + α2f (x) = 0, but not to
f (x + 1) − αf (x) = eα(x). Existence of tropical meromorphic solutions of diﬀerent
type to f (x + 2) − 2αf (x + 1) + α2f (x) = 0 remains open, see Remark 5.2.

We next deﬁne a special tropical meromorphic function Ψ(x) as follows:

(3.22)

Ψ(x) :=

j=0 max(0, x − j) , x ≥ 1,
j=0 max(0, x − j) , 0 ≤ x < 1,

j=[x] max(0, −x + j) , x < 0.

The idea to apply such a tropical meromorphic function goes back to Tohge, see
[18], p. 133. The importance of this function becomes immediately clear below.
For practical computations, Ψ(x) may be represented as follows:

(3.23)

Ψ(x) = ([x] + 1)x −

1
2

[x]([x] + 1).

It is an elementary computation to see that these two representations for Ψ(x) are
identical. As for the graph of Ψ(x) for x ∈ [−3, 3], see Fig 4.

Proposition 3.22. The tropical meromorphic function Ψ(x) is tropical entire of
order ρ(Ψ) = 2 and satisﬁes the diﬀerence equation Ψ(x) − Ψ(x − 1) = x.

Proof. It is immediate to verify that Ψ(x) satisﬁes the asserted diﬀerence equation.
Indeed,

Ψ(x) − Ψ(x − 1) = ([x] + 1)x −

1
2

[x]([x] + 1) − ([x](x − 1) −

1
2

[x]([x] − 1)) = x.

Next we see that Ψ(x) is a continuous piecewise linear function: Suppose that
0 < ε < 1. Then

Ψ([x] + ε) = ([x] + 1)([x] + ε) −

1
2

[x]([x] + 1) → ([x] + 1)[x] −

2

[x]([x] − 1) → [x][x] −

1
2

[x]([x] − 1);

the limits are equal as one may readily check. The diﬀerence of the slopes around
each integer, say [x], equals to [x] + 1 − [x] = 1, hence Ψ(x) has no poles, being
a tropical entire function. By elementary computation from T (r, Ψ) = m(r, Ψ) =
2 (([r] + 1)r − 1
1
2 [−r]([−r] + 1)), it readily follows
that ρ(Ψ) = 2, completing the proof.

Proposition 3.23. All tropical meromorphic solutions to

f (x + 1) − f (x) = cx,

c ∈ R

are of the form f (x) = Π(x) + c(Ψ(x) − x).

Proof. It is, again, straightforward to verify that f (x) = c(Ψ(x) − x) is a special
solution by substituting and making use of the identity Ψ(x+ 1)− Ψ(x) = x+ 1. (cid:3)

Proposition 3.24. All tropical meromorphic solutions to

f (x + 1) − f (x) = Ψ(x)
are of the form f (x) = Π(x) + Υ(x), where Υ(x) := 1

Proof. Recalling the deﬁnition of Ψ in (3.23), this is a straightforward computation.

4. Tropical difference Fermat type equations with two terms

In this short section, we solve equation (2.15):

βf (x + 1) + αf (x) = 1

for tropical meromorphic solutions:

Theorem 4.1. The tropical meromorphic solutions of (2.15) satisfy:
(i) If α = β, then f (x) = Ξ(x) + 1
2β ,
(ii) if α = −β, then f (x) = Π(x) + 1
(iii) if α 6= ±β, then f (x) = Lb(e− α

β x,
(x − b)) + 1

α+β .

β

Proof. If α = β, then (2.15) takes the form

f (x + 1) + f (x) =

1
β

.

The claim now follows from Proposition 3.16.

If α = −β, then f (x+1)−f (x) = 1

β , and an immediate application of Proposition

3.3 proves the claim.

As for the general case α 6= ±β, we may rewrite (2.15) as

f (x + 1) +

α
β

f (x) = 1.

Now, the general solution Lb(e− α

β f (x) = 0 follows from Theorem 3.1. Finally, a special constant solution 1

β f (x) = 1 is nothing but a trivial observation.

5. Tropical difference Fermat type equations with three terms

We next proceed to considering tropical diﬀerence Fermat type functional equa-

tions with three terms, such as

(5.1)

y(x)⊗n ⊗ y(x + 1)⊗m ⊗ y(x + 2)⊗p = 1.

In the classical notation, we have

(5.2)

ny(x) + my(x + 1) + py(x + 2) = 1.

First observe that if n = 0 or p = 0, (5.2) reduces back to the preceding section.
However, if m = 0, we have ny(x) + py(x + 2) = 1, and this needs to be considered
separately, whenever n + p 6= 0, see below.

TROPICAL VARIANTS OF SOME COMPLEX ANALYSIS RESULTS

5.1. The case n + m + p = 0. If n + m + p = 0, then equation (5.2) takes the form

(5.3)

F (x + 1) −

n
p

F (x) =

1
p

by setting F (x) = y(x + 1) − y(x).

If now n = p, then, by Proposition 3.3,

F (x) = Π(x) +

1
p

x.

Recalling then Proposition 3.5 and Proposition 3.23, we conclude that all tropical
meromorphic solutions to (5.2) may be written in the form

(5.4)

y(x) = eΠ(x) + Φ(x, Π) + Φ(0, Π)x +

1
p

(Ψ(x) − x).

If next n = −p, then we have m = 0. Reversed, if m = 0, then n = −p. In this

case,

F (x + 1) + F (x) =

1
p

,

hence F (x) = y(x + 1) − y(x) = Ξ(x) + 1
Proposition 3.14 and Proposition 3.23, we obtain

2p by Proposition 3.16. Relying now on

y(x) = Π(x) −

2

Ξ(x) +

2p

x.

It remains to consider the case n 6= ±p. By Theorem 4.1, we obtain

F (x) = Lb(en/p(x − b)) +

1

p − n

.

Therefore, by linearity and Proposition 3.17, all tropical meromorphic solutions to
(5.2) now take the form

(5.5)

y(x) = Π(x) +

p

n − p

Lb(en/p(x − b)) +

p − n

x.

5.2. The case n + m + p 6= 0. Deﬁne F (x) := y(x) −
the form

n+m+p . Thus, (5.2) takes

(5.6)

nF (x) + mF (x + 1) + pF (x + 2) = 0,

and all solutions to (5.2) follow as soon as all solutions to (5.6) have been obtained.
Writing now c := − m

p and d := n

p , (5.6) may be written as
F (x + 1) − cF (x) + dF (x − 1) = 0.

(5.7)

Ideas to solving (5.7) can be found in [12] and in [11], where the case d = 1 has been
treated. However, by Proposition 3.5 and Proposition 3.8 above, the statements in
Theorem 7.7 and Theorem 7.8 in [11] are incomplete. It had been pointed out in
[12] that a similar method could be used to solving (5.7) for arbitrary real numbers
d 6= 0, 1. Due to the incomplete reasoning in [11], we prove the following theorem
in detail.

Theorem 5.1. Tropical meromorphic solutions F of equation (5.7) exist as follows:
(1) If c = 2, d = 1, then all tropical meromorphic solutions F to (5.7) are
linear combinations of Π(x), of L(x) ≡ x and all tropical meromorphic functions
Φ(x, Π0) := [x]Π0(x), where Π0 is an arbitrary tropical meromorphic function that
is 1-periodic and satisﬁes Π0(0) = 0.

14

K. LIU, I. LAINE, AND K. TOHGE

(2) If c = −2, d = 1, then all tropical meromorphic solutions F to (5.7) are
linear combinations of tropical meromorphic functions that are either 2-periodic
and anti-1-periodic, or of type F (x) = [x − x0]Ξ(x), where x0 ∈ R is arbitrary Ξ is
an arbitrary 2-periodic, anti-1-periodic meromorphic function such that Ξ(x0) = 0.
(3) If c2 − 4d = 0, d 6= 0, 1, and c < 0, then all tropical meromorphic solutions to
(5.7) are either linear combinations of functions of type F (x) = Lb(ec/2(x − b)), or
linear combinations of functions of type (2) F (x) = [x − b0]Lb(ec/2(x − b)), where
ec/2(b0 − b) = 0.

(4) If c2 − 4d = 0, d 6= 0, 1, and c > 0, then all tropical meromorphic functions

of type F (x) = Lb(ec/2(x − b)) are solutions to (5.7).

(5) If c2 −4d > 0, d 6= 0, 1, then all tropical meromorphic solutions F to (5.7) are
linear combinations of functions that are either in Lb(eα(x− b)) or in Lb(eβ(x− b)),
where α, β are the roots of λ2 − cλ + d = 0.

Remark 5.2. (1) In Theorem 5.1(4), it remains open to us, whether the solutions
described therein are indeed all tropical meromorphic solutions to (5.7).

(2) Observe that the case c2 − 4d < 0 remains open, if d 6= 1, compare to [11], p.
165. Following the ideas in [11], see also [12], for the case d = 1, natural candidates
for solutions to (5.7) in the case d 6= 1 might be

F1(x) = r[x] cos(θ[x])(x − [x]) + r[x] cos(θ[x])(cos θ − 1) + sin(θ[x]) sin θ

2(1 − cos θ)

and

F2(x) = r[x] sin(θ[x])(x − [x]) + r[x] sin(θ[x])(cos θ − 1) + cos(θ[x]) sin θ

2(1 − cos θ)

,

,

where r2 = d 6= 1, c = 2r cos θ, θ ∈ (0, π). However, it is straightforward to see
that r[x] is discontinuous at integers, whenever d 6= 1, hence F1(x), F2(x) are not
tropical meromorphic.

it is elementary to verify that Π(x) and L(x) are,
Proof. To prove Case (1),
separately, solutions to (5.7) as well as Φ(x, Π0) for an arbitrary Π0. On the
other hand, is f (x) is an arbitrary non-vanishing tropical meromorphic solution
to (5.7), that is not 1-periodic, we anyway have f (x + 1) − f (x) = f (x) − f (x − 1).
Hence, Π0(x) := f (x) − f (x − 1) is non-vanishing and 1-periodic, meaning that
f (x) = Φ(x, Π0) + Π0(0)x by Proposition 3.5.

As to Case (2), it is immediate to verify that all 2-periodic, anti-1-periodic trop-
ical meromorphic functions are solutions to (5.7) as well as tropical meromorphic
solutions of type F (x) = [x − x0]Ξ(x) such that Ξ(x0) = 0. Moreover, if F is an
arbitrary solution, then we may write (5.7) in the form

F (x + 1) + F (x) = −(F (x) + F (x − 1)).

If now T (x) := F (x) + F (x − 1) vanishes, then F has to be 2-periodic and anti-1-
periodic. Otherwise, T is 2-periodic, anti-1-periodic, and F has to be of the asserted
form by Proposition 3.13.

We next proceed to prove Case (3). Since c2 − 4d = 0 and d 6= 1, then c

2 (6= 1) is

the root of λ2 − cλ + d = 0. Equation (5.7) can be stated as

(5.8)

F (x + 1) −

c
2

F (x) =

c

(F (x) −

Denoting T (x) := F (x) − c
If T vanishes, then

F (x) −

c
2

F (x − 1) = 0,

2 F (x − 1), we see that T (x) satisﬁes T (x + 1) = c

2 T (x).

meaning that F (x) must be of type F (x) = Lb(ec/2(x − b)). Otherwise, T (x) has
to be of type Lb(ec/2(x − b)) as well and we may write

(5.9)

F (x) −

).

To determine a point b0,j where e c
(b0,j − bj) = 0, we may take b0,j so that 0 ≤
b0,j − xj < 1. Then [b0,j − bj] = 0, and we get b0,j = bj − 2
c−2 .
It is now a
straightforward computation to verify that F (x) := [x − b0,j]e c
(x − bj) is tropical
meromorphic and satisﬁes equation (5.7). A similar reasoning may be used to treat
the case −2 < c < 0.

2

Case (4) is nothing else than a straightforward computation.
As to Case (5), it is again straightforward to verify the all functions mentioned
in the claim are solutions to (5.7). To see that an arbitrary solution to (5.7) is a
linear combination of functions in the claim, it is suﬃcient to refer to the proof of
[11], Theorem 7.9, the reasoning therein carries over verbatim.

6. Tropical difference Fermat type functional equations with four

terms

We proceed to considering tropical diﬀerence Fermat type functional equations

with four terms, such as

(6.1)

y(x)⊗n ⊗ y(x + 1)⊗m ⊗ y(x + 2)⊗p ⊗ y(x + 3)⊗q = 1,

where n, m, p, q are non-zero real numbers. Using classical notations, equation (6.1)
equals to

(6.2)

ny(x) + my(x + 1) + py(x + 2) + qy(x + 3) = 1.

The considerations can be divided in two parts, assuming that either n + m +

p + q = 0, or n + m + p + q 6= 0.

6.1. The case n + m + p + q = 0. This subsection splits in two parts, assuming
that either 3n + 2m + p = 0 or that 3n + 2m + p 6= 0. Before proceeding, observe
that our assumption n, m, p, q 6= 0 actually could be deleted. Indeed, if n = 0, or
if q = 0, then (6.2) returns back to the considerations in the preceding section. If
then m = 0, resp. p = 0, then denoting g(x) := y(x + 2) − y(x + 3), (6.2) reduces
to (n + p)g(x) + ng(x − 1) + ng(x − 2) = 1, resp. to (n + m)g(x) + (n + m)g(x −
1) + ng(x − 2) = 1, and we may again proceed by the arguments in the preceding
sections.

Theorem 6.1. If n + m + p + q = 0 and 3n + 2m + p = 0, then the following
conclusions hold for tropical meromorphic solutions y(x) of equation (6.2):

(6.3)

(n + m + p)g(x) + (n + m)g(x − 1) + ng(x − 2) = 1

and, making use of the assumption that 3n + 2m + p = 0, further

(6.4)

(n + m)(g(x − 1) − g(x)) + n(g(x − 2) − g(x)) = 1.

Denoting now H(x) := g(x − 1) − g(x), we obtain

(6.5)

(2n + m)H(x) + nH(x − 1) = 1.

We now proceed to considering the subcases separately (observing ﬁrst that if

2n + m = 0, then q = 0, contradicting our assumptions):

(1) In the case 2n + m = n, we have n = −m and equation (6.5) takes the form

H(x) + H(x − 1) =

resulting in H(x) = Ξ(x) + 1

g(x + 1) − g(x) = −

(6.6)

y(x) − y(x + 1) + y(x + 2) − y(x + 3) =

n

.

Setting G(x) := y(x) + y(x + 2), (6.6) turns into G(x + 1) − G(x) = − 1

n . Thus,
G(x) = Π(x) − 1
n x. It is now easy to solve this
equation termwise to obtain y(x) = Ξ(x) + Π(x)
2n . The claim now follows
by changing the notation. It remains to assume that n 6= ±p. Equation now (6.2)
reduces to

n x, hence y(x + 2) + y(x) = Π(x) − 1
2 − 1

2n x + 1

(6.7)

ny(x) − ny(x + 1) + py(x + 2) − py(x + 3) = 1.

By setting F (x) := ny(x) + py(x + 2), we get F (x + 1) − F (x) = −1. Thus

F (x) = py(x + 2) + ny(x) = Π(x) − x.

By an easy modiﬁcation of Theorem 3.1 and of Proposition 3.16, we have y(x) =
Lb(e−n/p( x
(n+p)2 , where x1, . . . , xK are the slope discontinuities
of f (x) in the interval [0, 1). The claim again follows by a slight change of notation.
For the rest of this proof, we have n + m + p 6= 0 and n + m 6= 0. Thus (6.3)

This implies that 3n + 2m + p = 0, a contradiction.

Denoting, as before, g(x) := y(x + 2) − y(x + 3), and further, H(x) := g(x) − 1

we obtain

H(x + 1) + 2H(x) + H(x − 1) = 0.

Recalling now Theorem 5.1, we have

g(x) = y(x + 2) − y(x + 3) = eΞ(x) + [x − x0]Ξ(x) +

where Ξ(x0) = 0. Therefore, f (x) = −y(x + 2) satisﬁes

where ξ1, ξ2, ξ3 are not equal to 0, 1. Let

(6.13)

= F (x + 1) − ξ1F (x) − ξ2[F (x) − ξ1F (x − 1)].

Then the equation (6.11) equals to

(6.14)

G(x + 1) = ξ3G(x).

The considerations are now divided in two cases, ξ3 6= −1 and ξ3 = −1.

Case 1. If ξ3 6= −1, denote ﬁrst H(x) := F (x) − ξ1F (x − 1). From (6.13) and

(6.14), we have

(6.15)

H(x + 1) − ξ2H(x) = G(x) = Lb(eξ3 (x − b)).

The necessary reasoning for this case is now to be carried through in a number of
subcases, depending on possible relatiions between the roots ξ1, ξ2, ξ3.

Case 2. If ξ3 = −1, then from (6.13) and (6.14), we now obtain

(6.16)

H(x + 1) − ξ2H(x) = G(x) = Ξ(x).

Again, a number of subcases are to be treated separately.

7. Hayman conjecture in tropical setting

In this section, we proceed to presenting tropical versions on the Hayman con-

jecture [8], recalled as follows:
Hayman conjecture. Let f be a transcendental meromorphic function and n ≥ 1.
Then f nf ′ − 1 has inﬁnitely many zeros.

Actually, Hayman proved the claim for n ≥ 3, and Mues [15] for n = 2. The
ﬁnal case n = 1 has been proved, later on, by Clunie [4] for transcendental en-
tire functions, Bergweiler and Eremenko [1], Chen and Fang [3] for transcendental
meromorphic functions.

TROPICAL VARIANTS OF SOME COMPLEX ANALYSIS RESULTS

21

Laine and Yang [13], Theorem 2, proposed a diﬀerence analogue to the Hayman

conjecture, proving
Theorem A. Let f be a transcendental entire function of ﬁnite order and a be a
non-zero constant. If n ≥ 2, then f (z)nf (z + c) − a has inﬁnitely many zeros.

Liu and Yang [14], Theorem 1.4, also proved a related result on the value distri-

bution of diﬀerence polynomials.
Theorem B. Let f be a transcendental entire function of ﬁnite order and a be a
non-zero constant. If n ≥ 2, then f (z)n[f (z + c) − f (z)] − a has inﬁnitely many
zeros.

We now consider tropical versions of the Hayman conjecture. In fact, we consider
values of f (x)⊗α ⊗ f (x + c) for diﬀerent α. This problem can be expressed as
the problem of the existence of tropical meromorphic solutions of ultra-discrete
equations of type f (x)⊗α ⊗ f (x + c) = b(x). We also can consider equations of type
f (x)⊗α⊗[f (x+c)⊘f (x)] = b(x), i.e. of equations of type f (x)⊗α−1⊗f (x+c) = b(x).

As our ﬁrst observation, we have

Lemma 7.1. If f (x) is a non-linear tropical entire function and α > 0, then
f (x)⊗α ⊗ f (x + c) is tropical entire as well.

Proof. Suppose G(x) := f (x)⊗α ⊗ f (x + c) = αf (x) + f (x + c) has a pole at x0,
say. If f (x) has no root at x0, then f must have a pole at x0 + c, contradicting the
fact that f has no poles. If then αf (x) has a root at x0, then −αf (x) has a pole
at x0, hence f (x + c) = G(x) − αf (x) has a pole at x0, a contradiction again. (cid:3)

Theorem 7.2. If f (x) is a non-linear tropical entire function and α > 0, then
f (x)⊗α ⊗ f (x + c) must have at least one root.

Proof. By the preceding lemma, G(x) := f (x)⊗α ⊗ f (x + c) = αf (x) + f (x + c) is
tropical entire. Assume that f (x)⊗α ⊗ f (x + c) has no roots. Then G(x) should be
a linear function px + q, thus

(7.1)

αf (x) + f (x + c) = px + q,

where p and q are constants. Since f (x) is non-linear tropical entire function, which
implies that αf (x) has at least one root, say at x0. But then x0 is a pole of f (x+ c),
a contradiction.
(cid:3)

We now state a partial tropical counterpart to the Hayman conjecture:

Theorem 7.3. If f (x) is a tropical transcendental entire function and if α > 0,
then f (x)⊗α ⊗ f (x + c) must have inﬁnitely many roots.

Proof. By Lemma 7.1, G(x) := f (x)⊗α⊗f (x+c) is tropical entire. If it has, contrary
to the assertion, ﬁnitely many roots only, then G(x) is a tropical polynomial. Let
x1, . . . xn be its roots. If αf (x) has a root at x such that xj < x < xj+1, then G(x)
is linear around x, hence f must have a pole at x + j, a contradiction. Therefore,
the only possible roots of f are at {x1, . . . , xn, x1 + c, . . . , xn + c}, implying that f is
a tropical polynomial, contradicting the assumption that f is transcendental. (cid:3)

Remark 7.4. If α < 0, the conclusion of Theorem 7.3 is not true. For example, if
α = −2, then the tropical exponential function e2(x) satisﬁes e2(x+1)−2e2(x) = 0.
This implies that e2(x)⊗(−2) ⊗ e2(x + 1) = e2(x + 1) − 2e2(x) has no roots.

Theorem 7.5. If f (x) is a tropical transcendental meromorphic function with
hyper-order ρ2(f ) < 1 and α 6= ±1, then f (x)⊗α ⊗ f (x + c) cannot be a linear
function.

Proof. Let f (x) be a tropical meromorphic function. Assume that

f (x)⊗α ⊗ f (x + c) = ax + b,
1+α x + b

(7.2)
where a, b are constants. Obviously, f0(x) = a
(1+α)2 is a solution of
(7.2). All tropical meromorphic functions of (7.2) can be represented as the sum
of f0(x) and the tropical meromorphic solutions of g(x)⊗α ⊗ g(x + c) = 0. By [12,
Theorem 9.1], g(x)⊗α ⊗ g(x + c) = 0 has no non-constant tropical meromorphic
solutions of hyper-order ρ2(f ) < 1. But then f = f0 + g is a tropical polynomial,
contradicting the assumption that f is transcendental.
(cid:3)

1+α − ac

Remark 7.6. The following two examples to show that if α = ±1, Theorem 7.5 is
not true.

Example 1. If α = 1, Theorem 7.5 is not true. This can be seen by the following
example, due to Chen 1. Deﬁne πa(x) = max{(1 − a)([x] − x), a([−x] − (−x))} for
0 ≤ a < 1, see the graphs below for a = 0.5. From these graphs, we observe that
πa(x) + πa(x − 0.5) ≡ −1 is a constant. By an easy calculation, we see that the
order of ρ(πa(x)) = 2, hence the hyper-order ρ2(πa(x)) = 0.

Figure 5. πa(x), a = 0.5

Figure 6. πa(x − 0.5), a = 0.5

Example 2. The counter-example when α = −1 can be from Ψ(x) in Proposition
3.22 with modiﬁcations. Deﬁne

We see that F (x) is a continuous piecewise linear function, hence F (x) is a tropical
meromorphic function of ρ2(f ) = 0 and satisﬁes F (x)−F (x−q) = x, which implies
that F (x)⊗(−1) ⊗ F (x − q) = −x.

8. Br¨uck conjecture in the tropical setting

In this ﬁnal section, we add some remarks on the tropical counterpart to the

Br¨uck conjecture [2], originally formulated as follows:
Conjecture. If f is a non-constant entire function with hyper-order ρ2(f ) < +∞,
where ρ2(f ) is not a positive integer, and if f and f ′ share one ﬁnite value a CM,
then

f ′(z) − a
f (z) − a

= c

for some constant c 6= 0.

Recently, using diﬀerence analogues of logarithmic derivative lemma, Heittokan-

gas et al [10] proved a diﬀerence result related to the Br¨uck conjecture:
Theorem C[10, Theorem 2.1]. Let f be a transcendental meromorphic function
with ﬁnite order ρ(f ) < 2, and let c ∈ C. If f (z) and f (z + c) share the value a ∈ C
and ∞ CM, then

f (z + c) − a

f (z) − a

= τ

for some constants τ .

As a tropical counterpart to the preceding Theorem C, we prove

Theorem 8.1. Let f (x) be a tropical entire function, a ∈ R be ﬁxed and sup-
pose that max(f (x + 1), a) and max(f (x), a) have the same roots with the same
multiplicity for all x ∈ R. Then three alternatives may appear, namely either

f (x) = Π(x) + Bx

for all x close enough to −∞, or

f (x) = Π(x) + Bx

for all x close enough to +∞, or

f (x) = AΨ(x) + Π(x) + (B − A)x

for all x such that |x| is large enough. Here A, B are real constants, Π(x) is a
tropical 1-periodic function and Ψ(x) is as deﬁned in (3.23).

Proof. By [11], Proposition 6.5, (max(f (x + 1), a)) ⊘ (max(f (x), a)) is linear, hence

(8.1)

max(f (x + 1), a) = max(f (x), a) + Ax + B

for some real constants A, B. As f (x) is tropical entire, it cannot be upper bounded.
Suppose ﬁrst that either limx→−∞ f (x) ∈ R ∪ {−∞} or limx→+∞ f (x) ∈ R ∪
{−∞}. If we now have x → +∞, then it is immediate to conclude from (8.1) that
A = 0. Letting then x be close enough to −∞, (8.1) takes the form

f (x + 1) = f (x) + B.

Solving this implies f (x) = Π(x) + Bx. Similar reasoning applies the case of
limx→−∞ f (x) ∈ R ∪ {−∞}.

It remains to consider the case when |f (x)| → +∞ as x → ±∞. Suppose ﬁrst

x → +∞. Letting x be large enough so that (8.1) takes the form

f (x + 1) = f (x) + Ax + B.

An immediate solution to this equation is f (x) = AΨ(x) + Π(x) + (B − A)x for all
x large enough. The corresponding case when x → −∞ is immediate.
(cid:3)

Remark 8.2. The corresponding considerations for f (x) being tropical meromor-
phic and non-entire are apparently more complicated, to be treated elsewhere.
