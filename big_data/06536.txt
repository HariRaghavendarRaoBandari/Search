Abstract

A novel technique for measuring the mass of the top quark that uses only the kine-
matic properties of its charged decay products is presented. Top quark pair events
with ﬁnal states with one or two charged leptons and hadronic jets are selected from
the data set of 8 TeV proton-proton collisions, corresponding to an integrated lumi-
nosity of 19.7 fb−1. By reconstructing secondary vertices inside the selected jets and
computing the invariant mass of the system formed by the secondary vertex and an
isolated lepton, an observable is constructed that is sensitive to the top quark mass
that is expected to be robust against the energy scale of hadronic jets. The main the-
oretical systematic uncertainties, concerning the modeling of the fragmentation and
hadronization of b quarks and the reconstruction of secondary vertices from the de-
cays of b hadrons, are studied. A top quark mass of 173.68 ± 0.20 (stat)+1.58−0.97 (syst) GeV
is measured. The overall systematic uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in
the b quark fragmentation and the modeling of kinematic properties of the top quark.

1 Introduction
The top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle and as such has a privileged interac-
tion with the Higgs boson. Its mass, mt, is hence an important input to global ﬁts of electroweak
parameters together with measurements of the W boson and Higgs boson masses, and serves
as an important cross-check of the consistency of the standard model (SM). Moreover, by com-
paring precision electroweak measurements and theoretical predictions, a precisely measured
mt can place strong constraints on contributions from physics beyond the SM. The top quark is
the only colored particle that decays before forming a color-neutral state through hadronization
and thus presents a unique opportunity to directly probe the properties of color charges.

Direct determinations of the mass of the top quark have been carried out with ever-increasing
precision since it was discovered at the Tevatron by the CDF and D0 experiments [1, 2]. More
recently, the most precise measurements reconstruct top quarks in hadronic decays and cal-
ibrate the energy of hadronic jets in-situ, using constraints from the reconstructed W boson
mass [3–5]. Other analyses exploit the purity of leptonic top quark decays and constrain the
neutrino momenta analytically [5, 6]. All four experiments where the top quark mass is be-
ing studied (ATLAS, CDF, CMS, and D0) have combined their results in a world average [7].
A recent combination of measurements at 7 and 8 TeV by the CMS experiment yields the best
determination of the top quark mass to date, with a result of 172.44 ± 0.48 GeV, i.e. reaching a
precision of 0.28% [8].

The most precise top quark mass measurements are systematically limited by experimental
uncertainties related to the calibration of reconstructed jet energies and their resolution, with
other important uncertainties concerning the modeling of the fragmentation and hadronization
of bottom quarks. To improve further the precision of the value of the top quark mass and
our understanding of the modeling of top quark decays, the development and application of
alternative and complementary methods is essential. Complementarity to “standard” methods
can be gained by using observables with reduced sensitivity to certain sources of systematic
uncertainties, such as the b hadron decay length [9–11] or kinematic properties of leptons [12],
or by extracting the mass from endpoints of kinematic distributions [13] or from the production
cross section [14].

This paper describes a measurement performed with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC
that minimizes the sensitivity to experimental systematic uncertainties such as jet energy scale.
This is achieved by constructing a mass-dependent observable that uses only the individually-
measured momenta of charged decay products (tracks) of the top quark. The mass of the top
quark is estimated by measuring the invariant mass of a charged lepton from the W boson de-
cay and the tracks used in the reconstruction of a secondary vertex (SV) resulting from the long
lifetime of b hadrons. The dependence of the observable on the top quark mass is calibrated us-
ing simulated Monte Carlo (MC) events. This approach is similar to a proposed measurement
using the invariant mass of leptons and reconstructed J/ψ mesons [15], but requires a lower
integrated luminosity to become sensitive.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the experiment, the collected and simu-
lated data, and the event reconstruction and selection; Section 3 describes control region studies
of b quark fragmentation and secondary vertex reconstruction; Section 4 describes the measure-
ment of the top quark mass and the assigned systematic uncertainties; and Section 5 concludes
and gives an outlook of prospects in the ongoing LHC run.

2 Experimental setup
2.1 The CMS detector

2 Experimental setup

The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6 m internal diam-
eter, providing a magnetic ﬁeld of 3.8 T. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and
strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scin-
tillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. The
tracker has a track-ﬁnding efﬁciency of more than 99% for muons with transverse momentum
pT > 1 GeV and pseudorapidity |η| < 2.5. The ECAL is a ﬁne-grained hermetic calorimeter
with quasi-projective geometry, and is segmented in the barrel region of |η| < 1.48 and in two
endcaps that extend up to |η| < 3.0. The HCAL barrel and endcaps similarly cover the region
|η| < 3.0. In addition to the barrel and endcap detectors, CMS has extensive forward calorime-
try. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors which are embedded in the ﬂux-return
yoke outside of the solenoid. A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a
deﬁnition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in
Ref. [16].

2.2 Data and simulation

√

This analysis makes use of a large sample of top quark pair, tt, event candidates with either
one or two isolated charged leptons (electrons or muons) in the ﬁnal state. In the semileptonic
(only one lepton) case, at least four reconstructed hadronic jets are required, whereas in the
dilepton case at least two jets are required. Events are selected from the data sample acquired in
s = 8 TeV by the CMS experiment
proton-proton (pp) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of
throughout 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb−1.
At that energy the predicted tt cross section in pp collisions, computed at the next-to-next-to-
leading-order (NNLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and including corrections and next-
to-next-to-leading-logarithmic resummation accuracy [17], is 245.8+8.7−10.6 pb for a top quark mass
of 173 GeV, where the uncertainty covers missing higher orders in the calculation as well as
variations of the parton distribution functions (PDFs). Signal tt events are simulated with the
leading-order (LO) MADGRAPH (v5.1.3.30) generator [18] matched to LO PYTHIA (v6.426) [19]
for parton showering and fragmentation. The τ lepton decays are simulated with the TAUOLA
package (v27.121.5) [20]. The LO CTEQ6L1 PDF set [21] and the Z2* underlying event tune [22]
are used in the generation. The Z2* tune is derived from the Z1 tune [23], which uses the
CTEQ5L PDF set, whereas Z2* adopts CTEQ6L. Matrix elements describing up to three partons
in addition to the tt pair are included in the generator used to produce the simulated signal
samples, and the MLM prescription [24] is used for matching of matrix-element jets to parton
showers. Following the generator chain, the response of the CMS detector is simulated using
GEANT4 (v.9.4p03) for both signal and background samples [25].

The most relevant background for the semileptonic channel is the production of a W boson
in association with hadronic jets. This background is modeled with MADGRAPH and nor-
malized to a total cross section of 36.3 nb, computed with FEWZ (v3.1) [26] at NNLO. Multijet
QCD processes are also relevant and studied in simulations using PYTHIA. Single top quark
processes are modeled with POWHEG (v1.0, r1380) [27–31] with the CTEQ6M PDF set and nor-
malized to the cross sections of 22.2, 86.1, and 5.6 pb for the tW, t, and s production channels,
respectively [32]. Charged-lepton production from Drell–Yan (DY) processes is modeled with
MADGRAPH for dilepton invariant masses above 10 GeV and is normalized to a cross section
of 4.4 nb, computed with FEWZ [33, 34]. The production of WW, WZ, and ZZ pairs is modeled
with PYTHIA and normalized to cross sections of 54.8, 33.2, and 17.7 pb, respectively, computed

2.3 Event reconstruction and selection

3

at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy using MCFM (v6.6) [35].

All simulated samples include the effects of pileup, i.e. multiple pp collisions in the same and
neighboring beam crossings (within 50 ns) as the generated hard interaction. The distribution
of the number of pileup events in simulation matches that in the data and has an average of
about 21 interactions per bunch crossing.

2.3 Event reconstruction and selection

The event selection is designed to identify the tt ﬁnal state in the semileptonic and dileptonic
channels. Single-lepton triggers are used to collect the data samples for the semileptonic chan-
nels with a minimum pT of 27 for electrons and 24 GeV for muons. In the dilepton channel
double-lepton triggers are required with a minimum pT of 17 and 8 GeV for the leading and
sub-leading leptons, respectively. In both cases isolation and identiﬁcation criteria are required
at the trigger level.

√

The events are reconstructed using a particle-ﬂow (PF) algorithm that optimally combines the
information from all subdetectors to reconstruct and identify all individual particles in the
event [36, 37].
In addition, improved electron and muon reconstruction, identiﬁcation and
calibration algorithms have been employed as described in [38, 39]. Electron candidates are
required to have pT > 30 GeV and to be in the ﬁducial region of the detector, i.e. |η| ≤ 2.4.
Muon candidates are selected with pT > 26 GeV and |η| ≤ 2.1.
In the dilepton channel these requirements are relaxed to pT > 20 GeV and |η| ≤ 2.4 for all
lepton candidates. The track associated with each lepton candidate is required to have an im-
pact parameter compatible with prompt production. A particle-based relative isolation is com-
puted for each lepton and is corrected on an event-by-event basis for contributions from pileup
events. The scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all reconstructed particle candidates—
except for the leptons themselves—within a cone of size ∆R =
(∆η)2 + (∆φ)2 < 0.3 (< 0.4
for muons) built around the lepton direction must be less than 10% of the electron pT and less
than 12% of the muon pT. In the dilepton channels, the electron isolation threshold is relaxed
to less than 15%. Events in the semileptonic channel are required to have exactly one selected
lepton, with a veto on additional leptons. In the dilepton channel, at least two selected leptons
are required.
Jets are reconstructed using the anti-kT algorithm with a distance parameter of 0.5 and taking
PF candidates as input to the clustering [40]. The jet momentum is deﬁned as the vectorial sum
of all particle momenta associated to the jet and is determined from the simulation to be within
5–10% of the generated jet momentum at particle level over the whole pT range and detector
acceptance. An offset correction is applied to take into account the extra energy clustered into
the jets due to pileup, following the procedure described in Refs. [41, 42].
Jet energy scale
corrections are derived from the simulation and are cross-checked with in-situ measurements
of the energy balance in dijet and photon+jet events. The selected jets are required to have a
corrected pT greater than 30 GeV and |η| ≤ 2.5. Jets within ∆R = 0.4 of any selected lepton are
rejected. The magnitude of the vectorial sum of the transverse momenta of all PF candidates
reconstructed in the event is used as an estimator of the energy imbalance in the transverse
plane, Emiss
For each jet, the charged PF candidates used in the clustering are given as input to an adaptive
vertex ﬁtter algorithm to reconstruct secondary vertices [43]. Secondary vertex candidates that
share 65% or more of their tracks with the primary vertex (deﬁned as the vertex with highest
T of its associated tracks) or that have a ﬂight direction outside a ∆R = 0.5 cone around
∑ p2

.

the jet momentum are rejected. Furthermore, if the radial distance from the primary vertex is
greater than 2.5 cm, candidates with an invariant mass consistent with that of a K0, or higher
than 6.5 GeV, are rejected (assuming each decay particle to have the rest mass of a charged π).

Secondary vertices are used together with track-based lifetime information in a multivariate
algorithm to provide a discriminant for jets originating from the hadronization of a b quark
(“b jets”) [44]. The chosen threshold on the discriminant output value has an efﬁciency for
selecting a genuine b jet of about 60%, while the probability to misidentify a light-ﬂavor jet as
a b jet is about 1.5%. Jets passing this selection are referred to as b-tagged.

Events in the three dilepton channels (eµ, ee, and µµ) are selected with at least two jets, of
which at least one is required to have a reconstructed secondary vertex. The dilepton invariant
mass is required to be greater than 20 GeV to remove low-mass QCD resonances. To suppress
contributions from DY production in the ee and µµ channels, the dilepton mass is further re-
quired to differ by at least 15 GeV from the Z boson mass (91 GeV), and Emiss
> 40 GeV is
required. In the two semileptonic channels, events are selected with at least four jets, of which
at least one has a reconstructed secondary vertex and one more has either another secondary
vertex or is b-tagged.

Table 1 shows the number of selected data events in the ﬁve channels and the purity of events

transverse decay length, Lxy, between the secondary vertex reconstructed from charged-particle
tracks inside the jets selected for this analysis and the primary vertex of each event. Good agree-
ment is observed between data and expectations based on mt = 172.5 GeV. The background
expectations are obtained from the simulation, except for the multijet background which is
determined from a control region in the data, as described in Section 4.2.

3 Analysis of b quark fragmentation in data
The crucial objects used in this measurement are the charged leptons from a W boson decay and
the charged decay products of a b hadron, forming a reconstructed secondary vertex. While
the reconstruction of leptons is well-controlled in the experiment, the modeling of hadroniza-
tion of the colored decay products of the top quark is subject to theoretical uncertainties. These
uncertainties affect the kinematic properties of the produced tracks, as well as their ﬂavor com-
position and multiplicity.

The parton-to-hadron momentum transfer in the hadronization of b quarks—referred to in
the following as b quark fragmentation—has been measured before in e+e− collisions by the
ALEPH, DELPHI, OPAL, and SLD Collaborations [45–49] , and in pp collisions by the CDF
Collaboration [50]. However, no measurement at the LHC has been published so far.

In this section, two complementary studies are presented that attempt to constrain the uncer-
tainties from the modeling of b quark fragmentation, which are expected to be the main con-
tributors to the ﬁnal uncertainty in this top quark mass measurement. These studies constitute
a ﬁrst step towards measuring the b quark fragmentation using tt events, but, as will become
clear, the 2012 LHC data do not provide the necessary statistical precision, and signiﬁcant con-
straints on the b quark fragmentation will be possible only with future data.

In this study we compare the PYTHIA Z2* tune, used by the CMS experiment at 8 TeV [22] with
an updated version which includes the e+e− data to improve the description of the fragmen-
tation. Without the inclusion of this data, the default Z2* b quark fragmentation function is
found to be too soft. The rb parameter in PYTHIA (PARJ(47)) can be optimized to ﬁt the e+e−
data using the PROFESSOR tool [51], resulting in a value of 0.591+0.216
−0.274. In contrast, the default
central value used in Z2* is 1.0 [52]. In this analysis, the improved tune using the rb central
value of 0.591 (and variations within the uncertainty band) is denoted as Z2* LEP rb (Z2* LEP
±) and is used to calibrate the measurement and evaluate the systematic uncertainty associ-
rb
ated with the calibration. For completeness, we also include other alternatives of the Z2* tune
using the Peterson and Lund parameterizations [19]. All the considered PYTHIA tunes use the
so-called Lund string fragmentation model [53]. The impact on the measurement of mt when
using the alternative cluster model [54, 55] is discussed in Section 4.3.1.

3.1 Secondary vertex properties in Z+jets and tt events
Events with a leptonically-decaying Z boson recoiling against hadronic jets provide an inde-
pendent and low-background sample to study the properties of secondary vertices. Candidate
Z events are selected by requiring two opposite-sign leptons with an invariant mass compati-
ble with the Z boson mass within 15 GeV. To minimize effects from mismodeling of kinematic
properties of the Z boson, events are reweighted such that the predicted pT(Z) distribution re-
ﬂects the one observed in the data. Furthermore, events are required to have a leading jet with
pT > 30 GeV that is spatially separated from the Z boson candidate.
The ﬂavor of jets with reconstructed secondary vertices in such events changes with increasing
number of tracks associated with the vertex. From simulation, we expect vertices with two
tracks to predominantly correspond to jets from light and c quarks, with the fraction of jets
from b quarks increasing to above 90% for vertices with ﬁve or more tracks.

Several observables of secondary vertex kinematic properties are investigated for their sensi-
tivity to modeling of b quark fragmentation. Of those, the highest sensitivity is achieved when
studying the ratio of SV transverse momentum—i.e. the transverse component of the vecto-
rial sum of all charged particle momenta used in the reconstruction of the vertex—to the total

transverse momentum of the jet carried by charged particles,

Fch =

pT(SV)
| ∑ch (cid:126)pT|.

Effects arising from mismodeling of the overall kinematic properties of the event are canceled,
to ﬁrst approximation, by studying the ratio of the two momenta, in which the secondary vertex
serves as a proxy for the b hadron and the charged particles represent the full momentum of
the initial b quark. Note that this observable is not sensitive to variations in the jet energy
scale, as it makes use only of the charged constituents of the selected jets. The observed and
predicted distributions for Fch in Z+jets events are shown in Fig. 2 (top), separately for vertices
with three, four, and ﬁve tracks. For each plot the average of the distribution in the data is
compared to the MC prediction using different b fragmentation tunes. The data appear to favor
softer fragmentation shapes such as the Z2* and Peterson tunes. However, in this selection a
signiﬁcant fraction of the selected jets stems from the hadronization of light and charm quarks
which are not changed by the event reweighting procedure used to compare the different tunes.
Likewise, the Z2* LEP rb tune only affects the simulated fragmentation of b quarks and was
obtained using data from LEP enriched in jets from b quark hadronizations, and hence is not
expected to correctly describe charm and light quark fragmentation.

charged component of the jet with three, four, and ﬁve tracks (from left to right) in Z+jets

LEP rb fragmentation tune. In each plot, the top panels compare the average of the distribution
measured in data and its statistical uncertainty (shaded area) with that expected from differ-
ent choices of the b quark fragmentation function in PYTHIA. For Z2* LEP rb, the error bar

mass extraction, the selected jets are expected to contain a signiﬁcantly larger fraction of b
quarks. From simulation, we expect a negligible dependence of Fch on the kinematic prop-
erties and mass of the top quarks, making this distribution appropriate to compare different
fragmentation models. The equivalent distributions of secondary vertex properties in tt events
are shown in Fig. 2 (bottom).

The observed distributions in this signal selection are generally well described by the central
(Z2* LEP rb) tune, but the comparison of the mean values of Fch—as shown in the top panels of
the plots—reveals differences between the various fragmentation shapes. Unlike in the Z+jets
data, the Z2* tune shows the largest deviation with respect to the tt data among the studied
variations, whereas the Z2* LEP rb fragmentation shape is in better agreement. Furthermore,
the hard and soft variations of Z2* LEP rb, corresponding to one standard deviation variations
of the rb parameter, provide a bracketing that encloses or approaches the data. The Z2* LEP
rb tune is therefore used as the nominal b quark fragmentation shape in the following analy-
sis, with the shape variations used to estimate systematic uncertainties in the top quark mass
measurement.

3.2 Inclusive charm mesons in tt events
Kinematic properties of inclusively reconstructed charmed mesons inside b jets from top quark
decays are expected to be sensitive to the modeling of b quark fragmentation. We limit the
study to meson decays with large branching fractions and high expected signal-to-background
ratios: J/ψ → µ+µ−, D0 → K−
π+ in semileptonic B decays, and inclusive D∗(2010)+ → D0π+,
with D0 → K−
Top quark pair signal events are selected as described above, but with the requirement of at
least one b-tagged jet replacing that of the presence of a reconstructed secondary vertex. In
the dilepton channels the b tagging algorithm output threshold is relaxed, as the expected
background is lower. All ﬁve leptonic decay channels of the tt state are considered, as discussed
above. To gather as much data as possible, both b jets in each event are considered, selected by
their tagging discriminant value and their transverse momentum. All charged PF candidates
used in the jet clustering are used to reconstruct mesons, with particle identiﬁcation restricted
to distinguishing electrons and muons from charged hadrons.

Candidates for J/ψ mesons are reconstructed by requiring two opposite-sign muon candidates
among the charged jet constituents, and ﬁtting their invariant mass in the range of 2.5–3.4 GeV,
as shown in Fig. 3. The distribution is modeled with the sum of two Gaussian functions for the
J/ψ signal and a falling exponential for the combinatorial backgrounds.
Neutral charm mesons, D0, are produced in the majority of b hadron decays, and are recon-
structed via their decay to a K− and π+. To reduce combinatorial backgrounds they are selected
together with a soft lepton from a semileptonic b hadron decay, whose charge determines the
respective ﬂavor of the two hadron tracks. All opposite-sign permutations of the three leading
charged constituents of the jet are considered for K and π candidates and no additional ver-
tex reconstruction is attempted. The Kπ invariant mass is then ﬁtted between 1.7 and 2.0 GeV,
using a Crystal Ball [56] shape for the signal and an exponential for the combinatorial back-
grounds, as shown in Fig. 3.
A large fraction of D0 mesons is produced in the decays of intermediate excited charmed
hadron states, such as the D∗(2010)+, which can be reconstructed by considering the differ-
ence in invariant mass between the three-track (Kππ) and the two-track (Kπ) systems, where a
soft pion is emitted in the D∗(2010)+ → D0π+ decay. The D0 mesons are reconstructed among

8

the three leading tracks as described in the previous paragraph, and selected in a mass window
of 50 MeV around the nominal D0 mass. A third track of the same charge as the π candidate
from the D0 decay is then added, and the mass difference is ﬁtted in a range of 140–170 MeV,
as shown in Fig. 3. The shape of the mass difference showing the D∗(2010)+ resonance is mod-
eled using a sum of two Gaussian functions for the signal and a threshold function for the
combinatorial backgrounds.

The position of the ﬁtted invariant mass peaks—reconstructed purely in the silicon tracker—
agree with the expected meson rest masses within about 0.05% for the D0 and D∗(2010)+, in-
dicating that the pion and kaon momentum scales are very well described. The observed J/ψ
meson mass, reconstructed using muons, agrees with the expectation [57] within about 0.3%,
well within the muon momentum scale uncertainty.

Figure 3: Fits to the invariant mass peaks of the three considered charmed mesons in tt events
in the data, as described in the text: J/ψ (left), D0 (middle), and D∗(2010)+ (right).

The ﬁtted signal and background distributions are then used to extract the kinematic properties
of the reconstructed mesons using the sPlot technique [58], where a discriminating observable
(in this case the invariant mass of the candidates) is used to separate the signal and background
contributions to the distribution of an observable of interest. The same method is applied to
simulated events with different generator tunes and a range of different b quark fragmenta-
tion functions, and the results are compared with data. Among several investigated kinematic
properties of the charm meson candidates, the fraction of transverse momentum relative to the
charged component of the jet momentum shows the highest sensitivity to variations in the b
quark fragmentation shape. The results are displayed in Fig. 4.

The reconstructed mesons are observed to carry about 50–60% of the overall charged jet mo-
mentum. These results are in good agreement with the predictions obtained from simulated
tt events for the central fragmentation function choice and corresponding variations. The con-
clusions from the study of secondary vertex properties in the previous section are conﬁrmed
by the charm meson properties, with the Z2* LEP rb fragmentation showing better agreement
with the data than the nominal Z2* shape, albeit with a large statistical uncertainty.

The numbers of meson candidates observed in the data are reproduced within about 10% when
PYTHIA with the Z2* tune is used in the parton shower and hadronization, whereas HER-

4 Top quark mass measurement
Observables that are dependent on the top quark mass are constructed using the kinematic
properties of the decay products of the top quark. The choice of observable is a compromise
between sensitivity to the mass on the one hand and susceptibility to systematic uncertainties
on the other hand. The most precise measurements to date have approached this trade-off by
fully reconstructing the top quark from three jets in hadronic decays, heavily relying on precise
calibrations of the reconstructed jet energies. In the analysis presented here, a different ap-
proach is used that sacriﬁces some sensitivity to minimize the reliance on detector calibrations.
This exposes the result to uncertainties in the modeling of top quark decays and b hadroni-
zation, but has reduced experimental uncertainties. The analysis will therefore immediately
beneﬁt from a future improvement of our understanding of these effects.

4.1 Observable and measurement strategy

The observable exploited in this analysis is built from the measured properties of the charged
lepton from the W boson decay and the charged constituents of a hadronic jet compatible with
originating from a common secondary vertex. The invariant mass of the secondary vertex-
lepton system, msvl, then serves as a proxy for the top quark mass. The msvl variable shows
a strong dependence on the mass of the top quark despite not accounting for the neutrino
from the W boson decay or from semileptonic b hadron decays, nor for neutral products of the
b quark hadronization. Using only charged particles and well-modeled leptons reduces the
main experimental uncertainties to acceptance effects.

For each selected event, all possible combinations of leptons and secondary vertices—up to
four per event—are taken into account in the measurement. Hence, by construction, the same
number of correct and wrong combinations (i.e. pairing the lepton with the vertex associated
with the other top quark decay) enter the analysis. In simulation, in about 11% of cases the
selected vertex could not be attributed to the decay products of either b quarks and is most
likely spurious, either from a light quark from a hadronic W boson decay, or from a gluon or
light quark from initial-state radiation.
Figure 5 shows the observed msvl distribution for a combination of all ﬁve channels, compared
to simulated distributions at three different generated top quark mass values.

Figure 5: Lepton-SV invariant mass distribution for a combination of all ﬁve channels, for
a simulation of three different top quark mass values (166.5, 172.5, and 178.5 GeV), and the
observed data distribution. Note that all possible lepton-vertex combinations for each event
enter the distribution.

The shape of the msvl observable depends considerably on the number of tracks associated
with the secondary vertex, shifting to higher values as more tracks are included. The analysis
is therefore carried out in three exclusive track multiplicity categories of exactly three, four, or
ﬁve tracks. Vertices with only two tracks show an increased level of backgrounds and reduced
sensitivity to mt and are therefore excluded from the analysis. Furthermore, when evaluat-
ing systematic uncertainties, the results from the individual categories are assigned weights
corresponding to the observed event yields in each, to absorb any mismodeling of the ver-
tex multiplicity distribution in simulated events. Hence the analysis is carried out in ﬁfteen
mutually exclusive categories—three track multiplicities and ﬁve lepton ﬂavor channels—and
combined to yield the ﬁnal result.

4.2 Signal and background modeling
The observed msvl distributions in each category are ﬁtted with a combination of six individual
components:

– “correct” pairings for the tt signal where leptons and vertices are matched to the

same top quark decay;

– “wrong” pairings for the tt signal where leptons and vertices are matched to the

opposite top quark decay products;

– “unmatched” pairings for the tt signal where leptons are paired with vertices that
cannot be matched to a b quark hadronization, i.e. either from a hadronic W boson
decay or from initial- or ﬁnal-state radiation;

– “correct” pairings for the single top quark signal;
– “unmatched” pairings for the single top quark signal, where there can be no “wrong”

pairs in the sense of the above;

– leptons and vertices from background processes.

Among those, the “correct” pairings both for tt and single top quarks, and the “wrong” pairings
in the tt signal carry information about the top quark mass and are parametrized as a function

of mt. The relative fractions of correct, wrong, and unmatched pairings for both tt and single
top quarks and their dependence on mt are determined from simulated events. Furthermore,
the relative contributions of tt and single top quark events are calculated using the top quark
mass-dependent theoretical predictions of the production cross sections at NNLO for tt, and
single top quark t channel as well as tW channel. The overall combined signal strength of tt
and single top quark signal is left ﬂoating in the ﬁnal ﬁt, together with mt.
The background contribution is a combination of different processes, depending on the chan-
nel, with dominant contributions from DY+jets in the dilepton channels, and W+jets and QCD
multijet processes in the semileptonic channels. The overall background yields are ﬁxed to the
predictions from simulation, with the exception of QCD multijets, the normalization of which
is determined from a ﬁt to the Emiss
distribution in the data, and DY+jets, which is normalized
in a data control sample selecting dilepton pairs compatible with a Z boson decay. The total
(statistical plus systematic) uncertainty in the normalization of the QCD multijets and DY+jets
backgrounds is about 30%.

the theoretical prediction; θbkg is a Gaussian penalty for a correction of the background yield;
and ﬁnally µ is the overall signal strength of top quark events, determined in the ﬁt.
The parameters of each of the f i
k templates and their possible mt dependence is determined
in a ﬁt to msvl distributions of simulated events in the corresponding category and pairing
classiﬁcation. The combined background template is built from ﬁts to dedicated samples of
simulated events of the corresponding processes, weighted by the expected event yields. The
shape for QCD multijet processes is determined from a control sample of nonisolated leptons
in the data and normalized using a ﬁt to the Emiss
distribution. For correct and wrong pairings
in tt and for correct pairings in single top quark events, the ﬁt is done for a range of generated
top quark mass points in the range 163.5–181.5 GeV, from which a linear dependence of the
parameters on mt is extracted. The msvl distributions for unmatched pairings and background
events do not depend on mt. Each distribution is ﬁtted with the sum of an asymmetric Gaussian
(Gasym) and a Gamma distribution (Γ), of which four of the six total parameters are found to
provide sensitivity to the top quark mass:

(cid:0)msvl|µ(mt), σL(mt), σR(mt)(cid:1) + (1 − λ) Γ(cid:0)msvl|γ, β, ν(mt)(cid:1).

The shape parameters are the mean of the Gaussian peak (µ), the left and right width parame-
ters of the Gaussian (σL and σR), the shape parameter of the Gamma distribution (γ), its scale
(β), and its shift (ν). Of these, all but γ and β show some usable sensitivity to the top quark
mass.

Figs. 6 and 7 for the dilepton and semileptonic channels, respectively.

The ﬁnal results for the top quark mass are then extracted by performing a binned maximum-

correction of the expected background yields (G), with a ﬁxed width of 30%, corresponding
to the uncertainty in the background normalization. Finally, the combined likelihood is max-
imized to obtain the ﬁnal mt result. The analysis has been developed using simulated events,
without performing the ﬁnal ﬁt on the data until the full measurement procedure had been
validated.

The method is calibrated separately in each channel and track multiplicity bin before combin-
ing them by running pseudo-experiments for each generated top quark mass point and cal-
culating a linear calibration function from the respective extracted mass points. Pseudo-data
are generated from the combined expected shape of the top quark signals and the mixture of
backgrounds with the number of generated events taken from a Poisson distribution around
the expected number of events in each category. The post-calibration mass difference is below
100 MeV for the entire range of generated mt values, well within the statistical uncertainty of
the overall measurement of 200 MeV.

4.3 Systematic uncertainties
The size of the systematic uncertainties is evaluated from their impact on the msvl shape and its
propagation to the extracted mt value in the combined ﬁt. Modiﬁed pseudo-data are generated
for each variation of the signal shape at the central mass point of 172.5 GeV, and the difference
between the mass extracted from the modiﬁed data and the nominal ﬁt is quoted as the sys-
tematic uncertainty. The individual sources of systematic uncertainties and the determination
of the shape variation are described in the following. The ﬁnal systematic uncertainties are
summarized in Table 2.

• Choice of renormalization and factorization scales: The factorization and renor-
malization scales used in the signal simulation are set to a common value, Q, deﬁned
by Q2 = m2
, where the sum runs over all extra partons in the event.
Two alternative data sets with a variation µR = µF = 2Q or Q/2 are used to estimate
the systematic effect from the choice of scales. These variations are observed to pro-
vide a conservative envelope of the additional jet multiplicity observed in data [61].
The scale choice for single top quark t and tW channels has a smaller effect on the
measurement because the production happens through an electroweak interaction
and because single top quark events only make up about 5% of the total yield. Ded-
icated single top quark data samples with µF and µR varied by a factor 2 or 1/2 are
generated and used to estimate the effect.
• Matrix element to parton shower matching scale: The choice of the threshold in the
event generation at which additional radiation is produced by the PYTHIA shower-
ing instead of matrix element calculations in MADGRAPH is expected to have a small
impact on the shape of msvl, affecting mostly the “unmatched” lepton-SV pairings,
which constitute only about 5% of the total. Variations of this threshold are further-
more observed to have small impact on the kinematic properties of extra jets [61].
The effect is estimated using dedicated samples with the nominal threshold (20 GeV)
varied up and down by a factor of 2.
• Single top quark fraction: The overall signal shapes in each category are con-
structed from tt events and events from single top quark production, with their rel-
ative fractions ﬁxed to the expectation from theory. Because of a relative difference
in their respective shapes, a deviation in this fraction can have an impact on the ﬁnal

rically in both up and down directions for the total uncertainty calculation.

mass measurement. The effect is estimated by repeating the ﬁts with the relative
fraction of single top quark events in the signal shape varied by ±20%. The size
of the variation reﬂects the experimental uncertainty in the overall cross section of
single top quark production [62, 63].
• Single top quark interference: Interference between tt pair production and single
top quark production in the tW channel at next-to-leading order in QCD is resolved
in the tW signal generation by removing all doubly-resonant diagrams in the calcu-

lation [64–66]. A different scheme for the resolution of the diagram interference can
be deﬁned where a gauge-invariant subtraction term modiﬁes the tW cross section
to cancel the contributions from tt. Samples using the second scheme are generated
and compared and the difference is quoted as a systematic uncertainty [64, 67].
• Parton distribution functions: Uncertainties from the modeling of parton momen-
tum distributions inside the incoming protons are evaluated using the diagonalized
uncertainty sources of the CT10 PDF set [21]. Each source is used to derive event-by-
event weights, which are then applied to obtain a variation of the signal msvl shape.
The maximal difference with respect to the nominal signal sample is quoted as the
systematic uncertainty.
• Top quark pT modeling: Measurements of the differential tt production cross sec-
tion reveal an observed top quark pT spectrum that is softer than what is predicted
from simulation [68]. The difference between the unfolded data and the simulation
based on MADGRAPH is parametrized and can be used to calculate event-by-event
weights correcting the spectrum. This reweighting is not applied when calibrating
the measurement, as it introduces a dependence on the true top quark mass. The
impact of the full difference between the predicted spectrum used in the calibration
(at mt=172.5 GeV) and the data-corrected spectrum is estimated by comparing the
result from reweighted pseudo-data to the nominal value. The difference is then
added as a one-sided systematic uncertainty in the extracted mass value. The effect
of the reweighting on the simulated msvl shape for correct and wrong lepton-vertex
pairings is shown in Fig. 8.
• Top quark decay width: The decay width of the top quark has been experimen-
tally determined with a precision of about 10% [69]. A dedicated sample with an
increased width is used to estimate the impact on the mass measurement, and the
difference is quoted as an uncertainty.
• b quark fragmentation: A variation in the momentum transfer from b quark to
b hadron has a direct impact in the msvl distribution, and correspondingly, the un-
certainty from the used b quark fragmentation function on the extracted top quark
mass is expected to be signiﬁcant. As shown in Section 3, the average momentum
transfer in the nominal PYTHIA Z2* tune is found to be signiﬁcantly softer than that
seen in tt events in the data, whereas the Z2* LEP rb variation that follows a frag-
mentation function measured at LEP is in better agreement. Its soft and hard vari-
ations provide one standard deviation variations of the shape parameters, and are
used to estimate the systematic uncertainty. Variations of the msvl shape for the cen-
tral Z2* LEP rb fragmentation function, its soft and hard variations, as well as the
nominal Z2* fragmentation are shown in Fig. 8. The impact of the choice of b quark
fragmentation function on the extracted top quark mass is shown in Fig. 9. To ﬁrst
order the measured mt value depends only on the average momentum transfer, as
indicated by the linear dependence on (cid:104)pT(B)/pT(b)(cid:105). The extracted mass changes
by about 0.61 GeV for each percent of change in the average momentum transfer.
• Semileptonic B meson branching fractions: The effect of the uncertainties in
semileptonic b hadron branching fractions is estimated by varying the fraction of
b jets containing neutrinos down by 0.45% and up by 0.77%, covering the uncertain-
ties in the experimentally measured semileptonic branching fractions of B0 and B±
mesons [57].
• b hadron composition: The PYTHIA Z2* tune produces an average composition of
about 40% B0, 40% B±, 12% Bs, and 8% heavier b hadron states in the hadronization

4 Top quark mass measurement

of b quarks. An improved version of this tune that takes into account hadron multi-
plicity measurements [57] is used to estimate the uncertainty due to the composition
of b hadrons in the b jets.
• Hadronization model cross-check: To test for additional uncertainties arising from
the usage of the Lund string hadronization model in PYTHIA [53] in the default sim-
ulation, additional cross-checks are performed with alternative hadronization mod-
els as used in HERWIG. However, an inclusive comparison of the two parton shower
and hadronization frameworks entangles various different effects in an incoherent
and nontransparent manner and includes uncertainties that are already evaluated
in dedicated studies in more sound ways. The inclusive PYTHIA-HERWIG difference
is therefore not included as a systematic uncertainty. Evaluating whether there are
indeed additional sources of uncertainty arising when comparing different hadron-
ization models requires a comparison without changing the parton shower model,
the hard-scattering simulation, or the b quark fragmentation functions. Such a check
is possible in the SHERPA 2.1.0 framework [70], which permits a pT-ordered parton
shower model to be used, interfaced with a cluster hadronization model as used in
HERWIG or with the Lund string model of PYTHIA. The change in hadronization
model entails a difference in hadron ﬂavor multiplicities, with the cluster model
tending to yield more heavy Bc mesons and Λb baryons. Restricting the study to the
dominant production of B0 and B± mesons reveals a different b quark fragmenta-
tion function shape between the two models. As the uncertainty from this effect is
already covered by a more extreme variation in the dedicated b quark fragmenta-
tion uncertainty, the distributions are reweighted to a common b parton to b hadron
momentum transfer distribution to remove any difference in fragmentation shapes.
The resulting lepton + b jet invariant mass distributions for cluster and Lund string
fragmentation are found to be in very good agreement and do not warrant any ad-
ditional uncertainty in the top quark mass measurement.
• Underlying event and color reconnection: Effects from the modeling of the proton
collision remnants and multiparton interactions (the underlying event) and from the
color connection of the b quark fragmentation products to the rest of the event (color
reconnection) are estimated using dedicated samples with variations of the Perugia
11 (P11) underlying event tunes [71]. Two variations, one with altered multiparton
interactions and one based on the Tevatron data are used to evaluate the effect of the
underlying event modeling. A separate sample, in which color reconnection effects
are not simulated, is used to gauge the impact from the modeling of this effect. In
both cases, the full difference of the results obtained on the modiﬁed samples and
the case of using pseudo-data from the central P11 tune are quoted as the systematic
uncertainty.
• Matrix element generator: The default Born-level matrix element generator, MAD-
GRAPH, is substituted by a POWHEG simulation based on the heavy-quark pair pro-
duction (hvq) model [72] at NLO accuracy for tt production and at leading order
for the top quark decays.
In both cases, the matrix element generators are inter-
faced with PYTHIA for parton showering. The difference, propagated to the mass
measurement, is reported as a systematic uncertainty.
Furthermore, the effect of including NLO corrections in the modeling of the top
quark decay is studied using the parton-level MCFM program [35, 73]. Since no frag-
mentation or parton shower evolution is included in the simulation and therefore
the actual impact on the mass measurement is uncertain, the result is only reported

4.3 Systematic uncertainties

here but not included as a systematic uncertainty. By reweighting the mass of the
lepton-b-jet system generated by MADGRAPH to the differential cross sections pre-
dicted by MCFM, with and without applying NLO corrections to the top quark decay,
a +1.29 GeV shift in the calibrated mass in the eµ channel is observed.
• Modeling of the associated production of tt with heavy ﬂavors: While the simu-
lation is observed to describe the shape of the different distributions for tt +heavy
ﬂavors well (most notably tt +bb), these predictions tend to underestimate the to-
tal cross section [61, 74]. To evaluate the impact on the measurement, the nominal
simulation is compared to the one obtained after reweighting the contribution from
extra b jets in the simulation by the data-to-theory scale factor measured in [61]. A
symmetric variation of the expected extra heavy-ﬂavor content is used to estimate
this uncertainty.

4.3.2 Experimental uncertainties

T

• Jet energy scale and jet energy resolution: By design, the reconstructed jet energy
does not affect the msvl observable. However jet momenta are used in the event se-
lection and therefore variations of the jet energy have an effect on the event yields
that enter the bins of the msvl distributions. The effects are estimated by rescaling the
reconstructed jet energies depending on pT and η before performing the event selec-
tion. The effect of jet energy resolution on the measured distributions is estimated
by inﬂating or deﬂating the resolution within the measured uncertainties and prop-
agating the effects to the ﬁnal distributions. The varied msvl distributions are used
to generate pseudo-data, and the full differences to the nominal sample are quoted
as the systematic uncertainties.
• Unclustered energy: The missing transverse energy is used only in the event selec-
tion for the ee and µµ channels to suppress events containing neutrinoless Z boson
decays. Since the DY yield is normalized from a dedicated data control region, the
effect from the Emiss
resolution is expected to be small. It is estimated by varying the
calculation by ±10% and
amount of energy that is not clustered into jets in the Emiss
studying its impact on the observed msvl distributions.
• Lepton momentum scale: The reconstructed lepton momenta directly affect the msvl
spectrum. The uncertainty in the measured energy scale for electrons depends on pT
and η and varies between about 0.6% in the central barrel region and about 1.5%
in the forward region [38]. The muon momentum scale is known within an uncer-
tainty of about 0.2% [39]. Varying the scales up and down within their measured
uncertainties—as a function of pT and η for electrons—produces a shift in the msvl
distribution that is propagated to the ﬁnal mass measurement and quoted as a sys-
tematic uncertainty.
• Lepton selection efﬁciency: Similar to the jet energy scales, the requirements ap-
plied when selecting lepton candidates for the analysis affect the event yields in the
msvl distributions and can cause a slight change in the extracted top quark mass. The
measured electron and muon selection efﬁciencies are varied within their uncertain-
ties and the difference is quoted as a systematic uncertainty.
• b tagging efﬁciency and mistag rate: The tt event selection relies on the use of a
b tagging algorithm to select jets originating from the hadronization of a b quark.
The impact on msvl from the uncertainties in the signal and background efﬁciencies
of this algorithm are estimated by varying the efﬁciencies within their measured
uncertainties and propagating the effect to the ﬁnal result.

5 Summary and prospects

• Pileup: The effect of additional concurrent p p interactions on the measured preci-
sion is estimated by varying the cross section for inelastic p p collisions used in the
pileup generation by ±5%, and propagating the difference to the extracted mt result.
• Secondary-vertex track multiplicity: The distribution of the number of tracks as-
signed to secondary vertices is not well described by simulation, as has been ob-
served in several processes involving b quarks. Generally, the data shows about 5–
10% fewer tracks than the simulation. As the analysis is carried out in exclusive bins
of track multiplicity to minimize the impact of this issue, it only enters as a second-
order effect when combining the results from different bins, as the individual bins
would be assigned slightly different weights in simulation. This is corrected for by
reweighting each bin content by the yield observed in the data, and the impact of
this reweighting on the ﬁnal result is quoted as a remaining systematic uncertainty.
• Secondary-vertex mass modeling: A discrepancy between the observed secondary
vertex mass (i.e. the invariant mass of the tracks used to reconstruct the vertex) and
the one predicted in the simulation is observed. The effect is propagated in the
msvl shape by weighting the simulated events to reﬂect the observed distributions in
each bin of track multiplicity, and the resulting shift in the extracted top quark mass
is quoted as a systematic uncertainty.
• Background normalization: Processes not involving top quarks constitute about
5% of the overall selected events and their combined yield is allowed to ﬂoat within
about 30% in the ﬁt. The normalization of the main background processes is further-
more determined in dedicated control samples in the data. To estimate the uncer-
tainty in the result stemming from the uncertainty in the background normalization,
the expected yields of backgrounds are varied within their uncertainties, and the re-
sulting change in the msvl shape is propagated to the ﬁnal result. These variations
are observed to have a negligible impact on the measurement as they are absorbed
by upward/downward variations of the background yields in the ﬁt.

4.4 Results

The top quark mass is measured from the invariant mass distribution of leptons and recon-
structed secondary vertices from b hadron decays using only charged particles. After calibrat-
ing the measurement with simulated events, a value of

mt = 173.68 ± 0.20(stat) +1.58−0.97(syst) GeV

is obtained from the data, with a combined uncertainty of +1.59−0.99 GeV. The overall systematic
uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the b quark fragmentation and the modeling
of kinematic properties of top quarks with minimal sensitivity to experimental uncertainties.
Figure 10 shows the combined result as well as the values obtained separately for the ﬁve
lepton channels and the three track multiplicity bins. The observed trend as a function of the
track multiplicity is compatible with the results obtained regarding the modeling of the relative
momentum of secondary vertices inside jets, as discussed in Section 3.

5 Summary and prospects
A novel measurement of the top quark mass has been presented, using an observable that relies
entirely on the reconstruction of charged particles. It shows minimal sensitivity to experimen-
tal sources of uncertainty. The ﬁnal result yields a value of mt = 173.68+1.59−0.99 GeV, equivalent

to a precision of well below one percent. The overall uncertainty is dominated by the b quark
fragmentation modeling uncertainty of +1.00/−0.54 GeV and the uncertainty in the modeling
of the top quark pT of +0.82 GeV. Experimental uncertainties related to the understanding of jet
energy scales only affect the event acceptance and are therefore virtually irrelevant to the ﬁnal
result. Studies of the b quark fragmentation with reconstructed secondary vertices and inclu-
sively reconstructed charm quark mesons are used to select the central b quark fragmentation
shape and to validate the systematic uncertainty.

With the signiﬁcantly larger data sets becoming available for analysis from the current 13 TeV
run of the LHC, this method could be extended to constrain the b quark fragmentation, using
the properties of the secondary vertices or charmed mesons, while measuring the top quark
mass. This is expected to lead to a signiﬁcant reduction of the overall uncertainty. Furthermore,
theoretical uncertainties related to kinematic properties of top quarks and scale choices in QCD
calculations are expected to decrease with the next generation of Monte Carlo event generators.

Finally, this result is complementary to standard measurements relying on kinematic properties
of jets. The precision of such analyses is typically limited by the uncertainty from the modeling
of hadronization effects, inﬂuencing the understanding of the jet energy scale, while not much
affected by the choice of b quark fragmentation model and the modeling of top quark kine-
matic properties. Therefore, a combination of this result with standard measurements could
optimally beneﬁt from independent sources of systematic uncertainties.
