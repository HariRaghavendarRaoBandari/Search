Unlike dry granular materials, a dense granular suspension like cornstarch in water can strongly
resist extensional ﬂows. At low extension rates, such a suspension behaves like a viscous ﬂuid, but
rapid extension results in a response where stresses far exceed the predictions of lubrication hydro-
dynamics and capillarity. To understand this remarkable mechanical response, we experimentally
measure the normal force imparted by a large bulk of the suspension on a plate moving vertically
upward at a controlled velocity. We observe that above a velocity threshold, the peak force increases
by orders of magnitude. Using fast ultrasound imaging we map out the local velocity proﬁles in-
side the suspension which reveal the formation of a growing jammed region under rapid extension.
This region interacts with the rigid boundaries of the container through strong velocity gradients,
suggesting a direct connection to the recently proposed shear-jamming mechanism.

Dense suspensions of hard particles in a simple liq-
uid have the remarkably ability to transform from ﬂuid
to solid-like behavior when stressed. One well-known
trigger for this solidiﬁcation can be impact on the sur-
face of such ﬂuid [1], but perhaps even more intriguing
is that solidiﬁcation can also be observed under suﬃ-
ciently fast extension [2–4]. Recent work has shown that
impact-activated solidiﬁcation (IAS) is a dynamic phe-
nomenon connected to a rapidly propagating jamming
front [1, 5, 6]. Here we consider the question whether
similar jamming fronts also are responsible for solidiﬁca-
tion under extension.

As jamming fronts propagate into the bulk of a sus-
pension, starting from the place at the suspension sur-
face where strain was applied, they convert ﬂuid material
ahead of them into solid-like material in their wake. If
such fronts are indeed created also under extension, then
a situation would have to exist that at ﬁrst glance appears
quite counterintuitive: When the suspension surface is
pulled upward, the front would need to move downward
rather than propagating in the direction of the applied
strain, as for IAS.

In this Letter we investigate the transient jamming dy-
namics of a large volume of suspension under extensional
ﬂow. We report the ﬁrst observation of propagating jam-
ming fronts under rapid extension. These fronts form
the leading edge of a solid-like region that grows into the
bulk of the suspension at a rate faster than the exten-
sion rate. Mapping out the ﬂow ﬁeld in the interior of
the suspension with high-speed ultrasound imaging, we
explicitly show that the fronts coincide with strong, lo-
calized shear. This suggests that the concept of shear
jamming, originally developed for dry granular materi-
als [7–9] but recently also identiﬁed as relevant for dense
suspensions [5, 6] applies here as well.

When a front reaches the nearest rigid boundary of
the container, the upward pulling force sharply increases,
concomitant with a rapid slowing down of the entire ve-

locity ﬁeld inside the suspension. The observed peak
stress can reach ≈ 70 kPa (Fig. 1) transiently. Such
value is much higher than reported previously for com-
paratively small cylindrical volumes under extension [2].
It is incompatible with explanations based on hydrody-
namic lubrication between suspended particles [10] and
also signiﬁcantly exceeds capillary stresses due to menisci
at the suspension surface [11]. Instead, such high values
of peak stress can be explained by a model that treats
the jammed region as a fully saturated porous medium
and considers the stress required to displace interstitial
liquid relative to the grains.

Our experiments use a prototypical suspension, corn-
starch in water. Cornstarch particles have irregular
shapes and range in size from 5µm to 20µm [12]. Sus-
pensions are prepared by slowly adding cornstarch pow-
der (Ingredion) for volume fractions ranging from φ =
0.50 - 0.54, in a density matched (ρ = 1.6 × 103 kg/m3)
solution of water, cesium chloride (CsCl) and glycerol.
By varying the glycerol content, we can tune the solvent
viscosity. Here, the solvent viscosity ranges from η = 10
mPa s to 63 mPa s.

To study the force response under extension, we use
a rheometer (MCR 301, Anton Paar). Unless otherwise
speciﬁed, we use a circular plate of diameter 25 mm con-
nected to the rheometer head through a rod (Fig. 1a).
For a typical measurement, the plate is ﬁrst placed on
the surface of the suspension and the normal force (FN )
is measured on the plate as it is pulled upward at con-
stant velocity v (Fig. 1b) controlled through a feedback
mechanism. The variation of FN as a function of time is
shown for two diﬀerent pulling velocities in Fig. 1c for φ
= 0.52. We see a sharp rise in force for a pulling velocity
of 8 mm/s, when the peak stress can reach ≈ 70 kPa.
The peak stress is limited by the adhesion strength be-
tween the suspension and the plate [see Supplementary
Information (S.I.)]. For v = 0.5 mm/s, the peak force
remains orders of magnitude lower. For granular suspen-

Here, the mass m(t) = V (t)ρ, where V (t) is the volume
of the jammed region pulled out of the bulk and ρ is the
density of the suspension. V (t) can be estimated from
geometry (Fig. 2):

V (t) ≈ π[h(t) + δh(t)]

[r(t)2 + R(t)2 + r(t)R(t)],

(2)

where r(t) and R(t) are the top and bottom radii of
the frustum as determined from the tangent drawn at
the middle of the curved surface of the frustum in the
vertical plane (Fig. 2a), h(t) is the height of the plate
measured from the rheometer data, and δh(t) gives the
surface depression estimated geometrically from volume
conservations (S.I.). To good approximation, the top ra-
dius is independent of time, r(t) ≈ 0.8rp (rp: top plate
radius). For the range of pulling velocities we use, the
term m(t)g >> v · d[m(t)]/dt, thus, FN (t) ∼ m(t)g.

We compare the force calculated from the above model
with the measured force in Fig. 2b. We ﬁnd very good
agreement at early times, demonstrating that the initial
force evolution is dominated by the growing mass of the
jammed region outside the bulk of the suspension. To
explain the sharp rise in force under extension, we as-
sume that, similar to the case of impact, the jamming
front grows in all directions, including downward into the
bulk (Fig. 1b), although the part that is growing inside
the bulk cannot be seen optically because of the opaque
nature of the suspension. As with IAS, the rapid rise in
force then corresponds to the jamming front reaching the
container bottom (or a side wall) [1, 5].

To test these assumptions, we map out the force re-
sponse by varying the initial depth h0 of the suspension
(Fig. 2c) for v = 8 mm/s. The critical plate displace-
ment (hc) at which force starts to rise sharply, increases
as we increase h0. Such delayed force rise with increasing
suspension depth is consistent with a jamming front that
propagates roughly at a constant velocity, similar to the
case of impact [1, 5, 13]. Estimating the ratio of front
to plate velocities, k = vf
v , given by k = 1 + h0/hc for
diﬀerent h0 values, we ﬁnd an average k = 6.5 ± 0.7 (φ
= 0.52), indicating that the jamming front travels much
faster than the pulling plate. This feature has also been
observed under impact [1, 5, 13]. For a given h0, the
critical velocity (vc) for sharp rise in force decreases as a
function of increasing volume fraction (Fig. 2d).

To understand the correlation between the observed
force response and system dynamics, to visualize the jam-
ming fronts, and to further explore connections to jam-
ming under impact, we use fast ultrasound imaging (Ve-
rasonics Vantage 128, at up to 1,000 frames per second).
This allows us to map out the ﬂow proﬁle by tracking
the scattering from small air bubbles inside the suspen-
sion by using particle imaging velocimetry (PIV). In the
ultrasound imaging set-up, the transducer is mounted un-
derneath the suspension, facing upward to image a verti-
cal slice in the same plane as the axis of the pulling plate.

tion of growing jamming front (brown colored region) under

(c) Normal force and stress as a function of time
for two pulling velocities. For v = 8 mm/s, cases of weaker
(black squares) and stronger (red circles) adhesion between
plate and suspension are shown, φ = 0.52, ηs =63 mPa s.

sions showing discontinuous shear thickening (DST), the
maximum stress scale is provided by the conﬁning capil-
lary pressure at the suspension-air interface [10]. For our
experiments, the observed peak stresses are much higher
than the predicted capillary stresses (< 1 kPa) [11]. Fur-
thermore, covering the surface with solvent to suppress
the capillary eﬀects results in essentially the same exten-
sional stress response, indicating that the static capillary
stress is not controlling the maximum stress (S.I.). We
ﬁrst focus on the part of the suspension that is pulled
out and above the bulk. To track the shape of this part,
we use high speed video camera (Phantom V12, Vision
Research). Typical images are shown in the inset of Fig.
2a. For lower pulling velocities (v < 3 mm/s in this
experiment; data not shown, but see S.I. Movie 2) the
system behaves like a highly viscous liquid: under exten-
sion its contact line retracts towards the center of the
plate and the suspension gradually ﬂows back into the
container. For v >4 mm/s, the contact line of the sus-
pension with the plate remains pinned and only detaches
after the rapid increase in force. This results in the for-
mation of a jammed region whose shape we approximate
by a truncated cone (Fig. 1b), which grows with time
and maintains its shape under gravity (S.I. Movie1). To-
gether with the high peak stress mentioned earlier, this
is clear signature of a solid-like jammed state, because no
ﬂuid can maintain such shape under gravity.

Next, we calculate the instantaneous gravitational
force on this jammed region having mass m(t) moving
upward with a constant velocity v. The normal force on
the plate is given by Newton’s second law:

FN (t) = d[m(t)v]/dt + m(t)g = vdm(t)/dt + m(t)g (1)

Instead of using a rheometer, in these experiments a lin-

plate has 10 mm diameter. The PIV analysis window
has size 36 mm×20 mm (S.I.) with a spatial resolution of
1.5 mm×1.5 mm. In Fig. 3a-d we show the velocity ﬁelds

the jammed region observed under impact [5]. In Fig. 3e-
h, we show the same velocity proﬁles as in Fig. 3a-d but
now with color indicating the radial velocity (−vr) com-
ponent. We ﬁnd that the maximum of |vr| is localized
near the edge of the jammed region and, as this region
grows with time, the magnitude of vr increases. We map
out the time evolution of vertical (vz) and radial (−vr)
velocity proﬁles as a function of depth (z) in Fig. 3i
and Fig. 3k, respectively, up to the point beyond which
the entire velocity ﬁeld within the PIV window suddenly
slows down. At early times, when the front just starts
to grow, the slope (gradient) of the velocity close to the
bottom boundary of the container (larger values of z) re-
mains negligible compared to that near the plate (smaller
values of z), but at later times the gradient near the con-
tainer boundary gradually becomes stronger. In contrast,
for slow pulling velocities, where the normal force does
not show any rise, the velocity gradient close to the rigid
boundaries of the container remains negligible compared
to that close to the moving plate at all times (S.I.).

The space-time evolution of the vertical velocity gradi-
ent dvz
dz shows that a strong negative gradient localized at
the front boundary (the region inside the black dashed-
lines in Fig. 3j), which gradually approaches the bottom
wall of the container. We can estimate the radial veloc-
ity gradient −δvr
δz along the vertical line that contains the
maximum of |vr| (dashed vertical lines in Fig. 3e-h). The
time evolution of −δvr
(Fig. 3l), also shows a strong neg-
ative gradient approaching the bottom wall as a function
of time.

The accumulation of a large shear rate at the front im-
plies that the suspension can generate signiﬁcant stresses,
large enough to drive it into a solid-like jammed state.
We can see this explicitly also in a separate experiment,
where the same suspension is subjected to a steady-state
shear ramp in a parallel plate rheometer (Fig.
3m).
At shear rates of ∼ 4 − 5s−1, corresponding to those
at the front, the suspension behavior changes abruptly
and the suspension enters a state where homogeneous
ﬂow is no longer possible and steady shearing initiates
solid-like failure modes, such as partial detachment of the
sample from the plate, slippage and formation of cracks
(the maximum stress achievable with a transiently shear
jammed state cannot be probed with steady state driving
because of these failure modes; the measured values [open
symbols in Fig. 3m] thus underestimate this stress).

The similarity between force response of dense suspen-
sion under impact [1, 5, 13] and extension sheds light
on the jamming mechanism.
In particular, it strongly
supports the notion of jamming induced by shear [8, 9].
In our case, shear enters into the problem in a non-
trivial way:
localized strong shear at the boundary be-
tween the moving and the (still) unperturbed portion of
the suspension gives rise to a growing jammed region
through shear-induced network formation between par-

4

ticles [9, 14, 15]. The particles experience local stress
levels suﬃciently high to be pushed into frictional con-
tacts, thereby breaching the lubrication barrier between
them [16]. This stress is enabled by the inertia of the
unperturbed suspension ahead of the front.
Inside the
bulk of the suspension, therefore, the ﬂow ﬁeld is essen-
tially the same as under impact, but with the direction of
ﬂow reversed. When the jammed region reaches the con-
tainer boundary, strong squeeze ﬂow gives rise to strong
shear that slows down the entire ﬂow ﬁeld due to shear
jamming and gives rise to a solid-like contact network of
particles extending from the bottom of the container to
the top plate. Just before the detachment, the plate con-
tinues to move at a constant velocity and for maintaining
continuity it tends to draw the solvent into the jammed
network of particles. This is seen by a sudden change in
surface texture of the frustum (from shiny to matte) just
before the detachment (S.I.).

We estimate the average steady state pressure ∆P (or
stress σ) at the top plate to suck the solvent (viscosity ηs)
through this jammed, porous medium, using a modiﬁed
Kozeny - Carman relationship [17, 18]

(see S.I.) where the sphericity parameter Ξ is of order
unity, vs is the solvent velocity, approximated by v, and a
the particle diameter. We get a typical estimate for stress
on the top plate σ ≈ 3 MPa (S.I.). However, this theo-
retical upper limit cannot be reached in practice because
of other physical eﬀects. In particular, the lower stress
along the rim, due to the reduced path length, leads to
breakage of the solvent layer at the rim before the max-
imum stress is reached. This can give rise to a dynamic
delamination leading to eventual full detachment. While
the exact mechanism remains to be explored, we believe
that the competition between the dynamic delamination
process and steady state solvent drainage sets the value
of peak stress observed in our experiments. This is cor-
roborated by the observation that the peak stresses scale
linearly with v and ηs (see S.I.).

One very interesting question for future studies will be
whether the dynamic jamming behavior observed here
for non-Brownian suspensions will extend into the regime
of dense colloidal systems, where the particles undergo
Brownian motion. A recent computational study by Mari
et al. [19] suggests that features such as the importance
of frictional particle contacts should carry over. This
would satisfy a key requirement for observing shear jam-
ming over a sizable range in packing fractions [9]. Smith
et al.
[3] indeed observed jamming in colloidal systems
under extension where brittle fracture happens at the
neck region rather than at the top plate. However, how
jamming fronts propagate and a dynamic shear jammed
state is established and maintained in the presence of
Brownian motion remains to be explored.
