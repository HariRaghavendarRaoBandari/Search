Abstract

Topological semimetals (TSMs) including Weyl semimetals and nodal-line semimetals are ex-

pected to open the next frontier of condensed matter and materials science. Although the ﬁrst

inversion breaking Weyl semimetal was recently discovered in TaAs, its magnetic counterparts, i.e.,

the time-reversal breaking Weyl and nodal line semimetals, remain elusive. They are predicted to

exhibit exotic properties distinct from the inversion breaking TSMs including TaAs. In this paper,

we identify the magnetic topological semimetal state in the ferromagnetic half-metal compounds

Co2TiX (X=Si, Ge, or Sn) with Curie temperatures higher than 350 K. Our ﬁrst-principles band

structure calculations show that, in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, Co2TiX features three topo-

logical nodal lines. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling gives rise to Weyl nodes, whose momentum

space locations can be controlled as a function of the magnetization direction. Our results not

only open the door for the experimental realization of topological semimetal states in magnetic

materials at room temperatures, but also suggest potential applications such as unusual anomalous

Hall eﬀects in engineered monolayers of the Co2TiX compounds at high temperatures.

3

Topological semimetals (TSM) are electronic strong spin-orbit metals/semimetals whose

Fermi surfaces arise from crossings between conduction and valence bands, which cannot

be avoided due to nontrivial topology [1–3]. Such new states of topological matter have

recently attracted worldwide interest because they may realize particles that remain elusive

in high energy physics, exhibit quantum anomalies, host new topological surface states such

as the Fermi arc and the drumhead surface states, and show exotic transport and spectro-

scopic behaviors arising from the novel bulk and surface topological band structures [4–16].

Among the proposed TSM states, two of the most exciting ones are the Weyl semimetal

[6, 7, 17–20] and the nodal line semimetal states [21–25]. While the Fermi surface of a Weyl

semimetal consists of isolated 0D points in k space, i.e., the Weyl nodes, the Fermi surface

of a nodal-line semimetal is a 1D closed loop, i.e., the nodal line winding in 3D momen-

tum space. Although the ﬁrst inversion breaking Weyl semimetal was recently discovered in

TaAs[6, 7, 17], the time-reversal breaking Weyl and nodal line semimetals remain elusive.

The time-reversal breaking (magnetic) Weyl and nodal line TSM states are predicted to show

exotic properties beyond the inversion-breaking TSMs such as TaAs. Firstly, ferromagnetic

materials usually have considerable electron-electron interaction. Hence, a magnetic TSM is

a promising platform to study the interplay between the TSM state and electronic correla-

tion, which may potentially lead to new correlated topological phases [4, 26, 27]. Secondly,

magnetic Weyl semimetals show the anomalous Hall eﬀect [28, 29], i.e., Hall-like conductiv-

ity without an external magnetic ﬁeld. When making such a magnetic Weyl semiemtal into

2D (monolayer), the anomalous Hall conductance may be quantized. To date, the quantum

anomalous Hall eﬀect has only been observed in magnetically doped topological insulator

thin ﬁlm samples such as Crx(BiySb1−y)2−xTe3 [30], which required ultra-low (mK) temper-

atures. By contrast, monolayer samples of magnetic Weyl semiemtals, which are natural

ferromagnets, may realize the quantum anomalous Hall eﬀect at signiﬁcantly higher tem-

peratures, and therefore make this novel phenomena relevant in actual applications [28].

Thirdly, the superconducting proximity eﬀect of a magnetic Weyl semimetal is predicted to

show topological Weyl superconductivity [31]. In such an exotic topological superconductor,

the superconducting gap has point nodes, which are Weyl nodes, and the Weyl nodes are

connected by Majorana Fermi arcs on the surface.

Despite interest, to date, magnetic topological semimetals remain experimentally elu-

sive. One main diﬃculty is that ferromagnetic semimetals, regardless of its topological triv-

4

ial/nontrivial nature, are rare in nature. The existing proposed magnetic TSM materials,

such as the pyrochlore iridates and HgCr2Se4 [4, 28] have relatively low magnetic transition

temperatures that are much lower than the room temperature. This fact not only hinders

the experimental conﬁrmation but also makes the predicted TSM state inaccessible in actual

applications. Here, we present our identiﬁcation of the room-temperature topological Weyl

and nodal line semimetal states in half-metallic Co2TiX.

A half-metal is a type of ferromagnet that acts as a conductor to electrons of one spin, but

as an insulator or semiconductor to those of the opposite spin. The half metallicity suggests it

as a promising candidate for the TSM state because both the Weyl semimetal and nodal-line

semimetal states require crossings between two singly degenerate (spin polarized) bands.In

this paper, we explore the possible existence of the TSM state in the half-metallic full Heusler

compounds. The half-metallicity in full Heusler compounds including Co2MnSi, Co2MnGe,

Co2FeAl0.5Si0.5, and Co2TiX (X=Si, Ge, or Sn) has been a well-known phenomenon in both

theory and experiments [32–44]. We focus on the Co2TiX (X=Si, Ge, or Sn).

Electronic band structures were calculated within the density functional theory (DFT)

[45] framework with the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, using the VASP (Vienna

Ab Initio Simulation Package) [46, 47]. The generalized gradient approximation was used

to describe the exchange-correlation eﬀects [48]. We used a kinetic energy cut-oﬀ of 500

eV and a 16×16×16-centered k-mesh to sample the primitive bulk Brillouin zone (BZ). In

order to compute the bulk band structures, we used the experimental lattice constants [32],
a = 5.770 ˚A, a = 5.830 ˚A, and 5.997 ˚A for Co2TiSi, Co2TiGe and Co2TiSn, respectively. The

spin-orbit coupling was employed in the electronic structure calculations as implemented in

the VASP.

Co2TiX crystalizes in a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice with the space group Fm¯3m

(Fig. 1(a)). Previous magnetic (SQUID) measurements clearly established the ferromagnetic

groundstate in these compounds. The relevant symmetries are the 3 mirror planes, M

x

(kx = 0), M

y (ky = 0), M

z (kz = 0), and three C4 rotation axes, kx, ky and kz.The Curie

temperatures are 380 K for Co2TiSi, and Co2TiGe and 355 K for Co2TiSn. Figure 1(c-

e) show the calculated spin-resolved density of states (DOS). We clearly see that, for all

three compounds, the band structure is fully gapped at the Fermi level for one spin, i.e.,

the minority spin, whereas it is metallic for the other spin, i.e., the majority spin. This

demonstrates the half-metallic groundstate of Co2TiX, consistent with previous theoretical

5

and experimental studies [32, 33, 38, 41].

Figure 2 shows the ﬁrst-principles calculated band structure along high-symmetry lines in

the absence of spin-orbit coupling. For the band structures of the minority spin (Figs. 2(a-c)),

we obtain a minority spin band gap of about 0.5 eV, which is in agreement with previous spin-

resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements [33]. On the other hand, the majority

spin band structures (Figs. 2(d-f)) show clear band crossings between the conduction and

valence bands along the Γ −X and Γ −K directions. Furthermore, additional band crossings

between the majority and minority spins (highlighted by the black circles in Figs. 2(g-i)) are

identiﬁed as we overlay the band structures of the two spins.

In order to understand the momentum space conﬁguration of the band crossings without

spin-orbit coupling, we calculate the band structure at all k points throughout the bulk BZ.

Figure 3(a) shows the band crossings in the ﬁrst BZ. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that the crossings

within the majority spin band structure form three nodal lines around the Γ point on the

kx = 0, ky = 0, and kz = 0 planes. Figures 3(c) show the energy dispersions along kx, ky,

and kz directions that cut across a k point on the kz = 0 nodal line as noted by the black dot

in Fig. 3(a). We see that the two bands disperse linearly away from the crossing point along

the radial (kx) direction. On the other hand, the dispersion becomes quadratic along the

tangential direction. These dispersions conﬁrm the existence of nodal lines. The two crossing

bands have opposite mirror eigenvalues, conﬁrming these nodal rings in the majority spin

channels are protected by mirror symmetry. We now consider the band crossings between

bands of opposite spins. Since the bands of opposite spins do not hybridize without spin-

orbit coupling, the crossings between them occur at all k points inside several 2D closed

surfaces in the BZ. Speciﬁcally, at the kz = 0 plane, the band crossing between opposite

spins form four solid areas as shown by the black ellipses in Fig. 3(d).

In Figure 4, we show the band structure after the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. In the

presence of spin-orbit coupling, the symmetry of the system and the electronic structures

depend on the magnetization direction. We have calculated the free energy of the system

with the magnetization direction along the (001), (110), and (111) directions. Our results

show that the diﬀerence of the free energy along diﬀerent magnetization directions is below

0.1 meV, which is beyond the resolution of DFT, suggesting that the system’s magnetization

direction can be controlled by an external magnetic ﬁeld. We present systematic calculation

results with the (001) magnetization. With the magnetization along the (001) direction and

6

in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, only the M

z mirror symmetry and the C4z rotational

symmetry are preserved. Hence we expect only the nodal line on the kz = 0 plane to survive.

Indeed, we found that this is the case as shown in Figs. 4(a,b). Near the kx and ky axes,

the nodal line is formed by bands of the same (majority) spin and is indicted by red color.

By contrast, along the kx = ky and kx = −ky axes (45◦), the crossing happens between

opposite spins and is denoted by black color. Since spin is not a good quantum number

in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, hence the above description is approximate. On the

other hand, the other two nodal-lines on the kx = 0 and ky = 0 planes are gapped out as

the respective mirror symmetries are broken by the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling and the

(001) magnetization. As a result, we expect Weyl nodes to emerge. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd

three-types of Weyl nodes, noted as W 1

001, W 2

001, and W 3

001 in Figs. 4(a-c), respectively, where

the subscript denotes the magnetization direction. The W 1

001 are located on the kz axis and

they are quadratic double Weyl nodes with chiral charge of ±2. The W 2

001, and W 3

001 are

at arbitrary k points in the BZ and are single Weyl nodes with chiral charge of ±1. The

energy and momentum space locations of the Weyl nodes are shown in Table I. Fig. 4(d)

shows the energy dispersion away from the W 1

001 Weyl node. The quadratic W 1

001 Weyl nodes

are protected by the C4z rotational symmetry. Indeed, we see that the two bands disperse

linearly along the kz direction but quadratically along the kx, ky directions. Finally, we

brieﬂy discuss the band structure with a (110) magnetization as the groundstate. Fig. 4(e)

shows a comparison between band structures with either a (001) or (110) magnetization

direction. It can be seen that the two band structures are very similar, which is consistent

with our conclusion that the free energy values with diﬀerent magnetization directions are

quite close to each other. We highlight the area enclosed by the orange box, which is the

band structure along the (110) (the kx

− ky = 0 and kz = 0) direction. While the band

structure with (001) magnetization shows an avoided crossing, i.e., a gap, inside the orange

box, the band structure with (110) magnetization shows a band crossing. In this case, the

three mirror symmetries (M

x, M

y and M

z) and the three C4 rotational symmetries (C4x,

C4y, and C4z) are broken. The preserved symmetries are the Mirror symmetry M

xy (the

mirror plane normal to the (110) direction), the C2 rotational symmetry along the (110)

direction, and the inversion symmetry. Therefore all the nodal rings will gap out. We note

that the band crossing along (110) direction is protected as the two bands have the opposite

eigenvalues of the C2 rotational symmetry. We have checked the chiral charge by calculating

7

the Berry ﬂux through a 2D closed surface in k space enclosing this crossing point and

found that it is indeed a Weyl node. We note that this Weyl node, W 1

110, does not exist

in the band structure with the (001) magnetization but arise with the (110) magnetization.

This fact suggests a novel possibility that the number, the momentum space location, and

other properties of the Weyl nodes in the Co2TiX system can be engineered by tuning the

magnetization direction.

In conclusion, we have identiﬁed the magnetic topological Weyl and nodal line semimetal

states in the ferromagnetic half-metal compounds Co2TiX (X=Si, Ge, or Sn) with Curie

temperatures higher than 350 K. Our results pave the way for realizing topologically pro-

tected emergent properties in magnetic semimetals at room temperatures, highlighting the

potential for electronics and spintronics applications in the Co2TiX-based compounds.

FIG. 1: Crystal structure and density of states of the Co2TiX compounds.

(a) The

face-centered cubic structure of the Co2TiX Heusler compounds. The Co, Ti and X (X=Si, Ge,

Sn) atoms are represented by the green, yellow, and blue balls, respectively. (b) The ﬁrst bulk

Brillouin zone. High symmetry points are marked. (c-e) Calculated spin-resolved density of states

(DOS) of Co2TiX without spin-orbit coupling.

FIG. 2: Spin-resolved band structure and ferromagnetic half-metallic ground states in

Co2TiX. (a-c) The calculated bulk band structures of the majority spin of the Co2TiSi, Co2TiGe,

and Co2TiSn, respectively. (d-f) Same as panels (a-c) but for the minority spin. (g-i) The band

structures of both spins.

FIG. 3: The topological nodal-lines in Co2TiX in the absence spin-orbit coupling. (a)

The nodal-lines in k

x-k

y-k

z space formed by the band crossings within the majority band structure.

(b) The band structure in E-k

x-k

y space containing the nodal-line on the k

z = 0 plane. On k

z=0

plane, the bulk valence and conduction bands dip into with each other and form a energy-dependent

nodal-line (the red line). (c) The energy dispersions along k

x (left panel), k

y (middle panel), and

z (left panel) directions away from the crossing point surrounded by the black circle in panel (a).

FIG. 4: Weyl nodes and nodal-lines in Co2TiX in the presence of spin-orbit coupling.

(a) Band crossings in the ﬁrst BZ. There are one nodal line on k

z=0 plane and three types of Weyl

nodes (shown by the dots) in the ﬁrst BZ. The white and black colors denote the chiral charge of

the Weyl nodes. (b) The projection of the band crossings on the (001) top surface. The projected

Weyl nodes are shown by the yellow dots, all of which have a projected chiral charge of 0 as two

Weyl nodes of opposite chiralities are projected onto the same point on the (001) surface. The

nodal line in panels (a,b) is shown by the solid lines which are in two colors (red and black). The

red segments denote the band crossings formed by two bands of the same (majority) spin whereas

the black ones are formed by bands of opposite spins. (c) The projection of the band crossings

on the (010) side surface. (d) The energy dispersions along k

x/k

y (left panel) and k

z (righ panel)

directions of W 1

001 Weyl cone. The quadratic touching of two bands along k

x/k

y direction proves

that the chiral charge of the Weyl cone is ±2. (e) A comparison of the band structures of Co2TiX

with a (001) or (110) magnetization direction. The number and momentum space locations of the

Weyl nodes critically depend on the magnetization directions. (f) The zoom-in view of the area

indicated by the orange box in panel (e). Unlike the case in the (001) magnetization, the band

crossing remains intact with the (110) magnetization, and therefore becomes a Weyl node, the

W 1

110.
