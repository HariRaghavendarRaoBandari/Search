Analyticity and criticality results for the eigenvalues of the

biharmonic operator

Davide Buoso∗

Abstract: We consider the eigenvalues of the biharmonic operator subject to several homo-
geneous boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, Navier, Steklov). We show that simple
eigenvalues and elementary symmetric functions of multiple eigenvalues are real analytic, and
provide Hadamard-type formulas for the corresponding shape derivatives. After recalling the
known results in shape optimization, we prove that balls are always critical domains under
volume constraint.

Keywords: biharmonic operator; boundary value problems; Steklov; plates; eigenvalues; per-
turbations; Hadamard formulas; isovolumetric perturbations; shape criticality.

1 Introduction

In this paper we consider eigenvalue problems for the biharmonic operator subject to several
homogeneous boundary conditions in bounded domains Ω in RN , N ≥ 2. Note that such
problems arise in the study of vibrating plates within the so-called Kirchhoﬀ-Love model (see
e.g., [43]). In particular, we consider the following equation

∆2u − τ ∆u = λu, in Ω,

(1)

where τ is a non-negative constant related to the lateral tension of the plate. As for the
boundary conditions, we are interested in Dirichlet boundary conditions

u =

∂u
∂ν

= 0 on ∂Ω,

which are related to clamped plates, Navier boundary conditions

u = (1 − σ)

∂2u
∂ν2 + σ∆u = 0 on ∂Ω,

which are related to hinged plates, and Neumann boundary conditions

which are related to free plates. Note that σ denotes the Poisson ratio of the material, typically
0 ≤ σ ≤ 0.5. We recall that the conditions (4) have been known for long time only in dimension
N = 2 (see e.g., [28, 47]), while the general case ﬁrst appeared in [21] (see also [22]). We recall
here that, given a vector function f , its tangential component is deﬁned as f∂Ω = f − (f · ν)ν,
and the tangential divergence operator is div∂Ωf = divf − ∂f

∂ν · ν.

We also consider Steklov-type problems for the biharmonic operator. Note that the ﬁrst

one to appear was the following

∆2u = 0,
u = 0,
∆u = λ ∂u
∂ν ,

in Ω,
on ∂Ω,

and it was introduced in [32]. Problem (5) has proved itself to be quite strange with respect
to other Laplacian-related eigenvalue problem, at least concerning shape optimization results.
In fact, diﬀerently from the classical Steklov problem where the interesting problem is the
maximization of eigenvalues under volume constraint, here one searches for minimizers and,
strikingly, the ball is not the optimal shape for the ﬁrst eigenvalue (at least in dimension
N = 2), as shown in [33]. Nevertheless, in [7] the authors can prove that, among all convex
domain of ﬁxed measure there exists a minimizer, but nothing is known about the optimal
shape, or if the convexity assumption can be relaxed. We also refer to [2, 5, 6] for other results
on problem (5).

Another Steklov problem for the biharmonic operator which has appeared very recently in

[15] (see also [16]) is the following

in Ω,
on ∂Ω,

(6)

∆2u − τ ∆u = 0,
∂ 2u
∂ν 2 = 0,
∂ν − ∂∆u
τ ∂u




∂ν − div∂Ω(cid:0)νtD2u(cid:1)∂Ω = λu, on ∂Ω.

In contrast with problem (5), problem (6) presents several spectral features resembling those
of the Steklov-Laplacian. As shown in [15], problem (6) can be viewed as a limiting Neumann
problem via mass concentration arguments (cf. [38]), and moreover, for any ﬁxed τ > 0, the
maximizer of the ﬁrst positive eigenvalue among all bounded smooth domains is the ball.

In this paper we are interested in analyticity properties of the eigenvalues of problems (1)-
(6). This type of analysis was ﬁrst done by Lamberti and Lanza de Cristoforis in [35], where
they study regularity properties of the elementary symmetric functions of the eigenvalues of the
Laplace operator subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. Note that in general, when dealing
with eigenvalues splitting from a multiple eigenvalue, bifurcation phenomena may occur, and the
use of symmetric functions of the eigenvalues permits to bypass such situations. The techniques
in [35] were later used to treat other types of boundary conditions (see [34, 37]) and even other
operators (see [9, 13, 14]). As for the biharmonic operator, this kind of analysis has been already
carried out in several speciﬁc cases, see [11, 12, 15, 16]. Our aim here is to treat those cases
altogether in order to give a general overview.

After proving that the elementary symmetric functions of the eigenvalues are analytic upon
domain perturbations, we compute their shape diﬀerential. Following the lines of [36], by means
of the Lagrange Multiplier Theorem, we can show that the ball is a critical domain under volume
constraint for any of the elementary symmetric functions of the eigenvalues of problems (1)-(6).
We observe that, regarding problem (5), such a result was already obtained in [7] but only for

2

the ﬁrst eigenvalue. We remark that the question of criticality of domains is strictly related
with shape optimization problems, where the minimizing (resp. maximizing) domain has to
be found in a class of ﬁxed volume ones. This type of problems for the eigenvalues of the
biharmonic operator have been solved only in very speciﬁc cases, the optimal domain for the
ﬁrst eigenvalue being the ball (see [3, 15, 21, 22, 39]). As we have said above, for problem (5)
the ball has been proved not to be the minimizer, nevertheless it still is a critical domain (cf.
Theorem 6).

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to some preliminaries. In Section
3 we examine the problem of shape diﬀerentiability of the eigenvalues. We consider problem
(10) in φ(Ω) and pull it back to Ω, where φ belongs to a suitable class of diﬀeomorphisms. We
also derive Hadamard-type formulas for the elementary symmetric functions of the eigenvalues.
In Section 4 we consider the problem of ﬁnding critical points for such functions under volume
constraint. We provide a characterization for the critical domains, and show that, for all the
problems considered, balls are critical domains for all the elementary symmetric functions of
the eigenvalues. Finally, in Section 5 we prove some technical results.

2 Preliminaries

Let N ∈ N, N ≥ 2, and let Ω be a bounded open set in RN of class C1. By H k(Ω), k ∈ N,
we denote the Sobolev space of functions in L2(Ω) with derivatives up to order k in L2(Ω), and
0 (Ω) we denote the closure in H k(Ω) of the space of C∞-functions with compact support
by H k
in Ω.

Let also τ ≥ 0, − 1

N −1 < σ < 1. We consider the following bilinear form on H 2(Ω)

P = (1 − σ)M + σB + τ L,

(7)

where

and

M [u][v] = ZΩ

D2u : D2vdx, B[u][v] = ZΩ
L[u][v] = ZΩ

∇u · ∇vdx,

∆u∆vdx,

for any u, v ∈ H 2(Ω), where we denote by D2u : D2v the Frobenius product D2u : D2v =

i,j=1

PN

∂ 2u

∂ 2v

∂xi∂xj

∂xi∂xj

. We also consider the following bilinear forms on H 2(Ω)

J1[u][v] = ZΩ

uvdx, J2[u][v] = Z∂Ω

∂u
∂ν

∂v
∂ν

dσ, J3[u][v] = Z∂Ω

uvdσ,

for any u, v ∈ H 2(Ω), where we denote by ν the unit outer normal vector to ∂Ω, and by dσ the
area element.

Using this notation, problems (1)-(4) can be stated in the following weak form

P [u][v] = λJ1[u][v], ∀v ∈ V (Ω),

where V (Ω) is either H 2
0 (Ω) (for the Navier
problem), or H 2(Ω) (for the Neumann problem). Here and in the sequel the bilinear forms
deﬁned on V (Ω) will be understood also as linear operators acting from V (Ω) to its dual.

0 (Ω) (for the Dirichlet problem), or H 2(Ω) ∩ H 1

3

As for Steklov-type problems, we shall consider their generalizations according to the deﬁ-

nition of P . In particular, regarding problem (5), we consider the following generalization




whose weak formulation is

∆2u − τ ∆u = 0,
u = 0,
(1 − σ) ∂ 2 u

∂ν 2 + σ∆u = λ ∂u

in Ω,
on ∂Ω,
∂ν , on ∂Ω,

P [u][v] = λJ2[u][v], ∀v ∈ H 2(Ω) ∩ H 1

0 (Ω).

We also consider the following generalization of problem (6)

∆2u − τ ∆u = 0,
(1 − σ) ∂ 2u
∂ν − ∂∆u
τ ∂u




whose weak formulation is

∂ν 2 + σ∆u = 0,
∂ν − (1 − σ)div∂Ω(cid:0)νtD2u(cid:1)∂Ω = λu, on ∂Ω,

in Ω,
on ∂Ω,

(8)

(9)

P [u][v] = λJ3[u][v], ∀v ∈ H 2(Ω).

Using a uniﬁed notation, we can therefore write all the problems we are considering as

P [u][v] = λJi[u][v], ∀v ∈ V (Ω),

(10)

where:

• for the Dirichlet problem (1), (2) we set i = 1, V (Ω) = H 2

0 (Ω);

• for the Navier problem (1), (3) we set i = 1, V (Ω) = H 2(Ω) ∩ H 1

0 (Ω);

• for the Neumann problem (1), (4) we set i = 1, V (Ω) = H 2(Ω);

• for the Steklov problem (8) we set i = 2, V (Ω) = H 2(Ω) ∩ H 1

0 (Ω);

• for the Steklov problem (9) we set i = 3, V (Ω) = H 2(Ω).

It is clear that both the Neumann problem (1), (4) and the Steklov problem (9) have non-
trivial kernel. In particular, if τ > 0 then both kernels are given by the constant functions, while
if τ = 0 the kernels have dimension N + 1 including also the coordinate functions x1, . . . , xN
(cf. [15, Theorem 3.8]). For this reason, we will restrict our attention to the case τ > 0 and
consider instead V (Ω) = H 2(Ω)/R for problems (1), (4) and (9) (the case τ = 0 being similar).
With this choice of the space V (Ω), it is possible to show that the bilinear form P deﬁnes
a scalar product on V (Ω) which is equivalent to the standard one. We shall therefore consider
V (Ω) as endowed with such a scalar product.

It is easily seen that P , considered as an operator acting from V (Ω) to its dual, is a linear

homeomorphism. In particular, we can deﬁne

Ti = P (−1) ◦ Ji,

(11)

for i = 1, 2, 3. We have the following

4

Theorem 1. Let − 1
N −1 < σ < 1, τ > 0. Let Ω be a bounded domain in RN of class C1. The
operator Ti deﬁned in (11) is a non-negative compact selfadjoint operator on the Hilbert space
V (Ω). Its spectrum is discrete and consists of a decreasing sequence of positive eigenvalues of
ﬁnite multiplicity converging to zero. Moreover, the equation Tiu = µu is satisﬁed for some
u ∈ V (Ω), µ > 0 if and only if equation (10) is satisﬁed with 0 6= λ = µ−1 for any v ∈ V (Ω).
In particular, the eigenvalues of problem (10) can be arranged in a diverging sequence

0 < λ1[Ω] ≤ λ2[Ω] ≤ · · · ≤ λk[Ω] ≤ · · · ,

where all the eigenvalues are repeated according to their multiplicity, and the following varia-
tional characterization holds

λk[Ω] = min

E≤V (Ω)
dim E=k

max
u∈E

Ji[u][u]6=0

P [u][u]
Ji[u][u]

.

Proof. For the selfadjointness, it suﬃces to observe that

< Ti[u], v >=< P (−1) ◦ Ji[u], v >= P [P (−1) ◦ Ji[u]][v] = Ji[u][v],

for any u, v ∈ V (Ω). For the compactness, just observe that the operator Ji is compact. The
remaining statements are straightforward.

Remark 2. As we have said in Section 1, in applications 0 ≤ σ ≤ 0.5. However, there are
examples of materials with high or negative Poisson ratio, namely (N = 2)

−1 < σ < 1.

In general dimension we choose − 1
inequality

N −1 < σ < 1. This is due to the fact that, thanks to the

|D2u|2 ≥

1
N

(∆u)2 ∀u ∈ H 2(Ω),

then, for σ in that range, the operator P turns out to be coercive. We also remark that, following
the arguments in [15, Section 3], the Steklov problem (9) can be seen as a limiting Neumann
problem of the type (1), (4) with a mass distribution concentrating to the boundary.

We note that problem (5) is obtained for σ = 1, which is out of our range. Under some
additional regularity assumptions, for instance Ω ∈ C2 (see e.g., [7] for general conditions),
then the operator becomes coercive and all the results here and in the sequel apply as well.
The same remains true also for the Navier problem (1), (3), which for σ = 1 reads

(cid:26) ∆2u − τ ∆u = λu,

u = ∆u = 0,

in Ω,
on ∂Ω,

which has been extensively studied in the case τ = 0 (we refer to [4, 27, 41, 45] and the references
therein).

The situation is instead completely diﬀerent in the case of Neumann boundary conditions

with σ = 1, namely

(cid:26) ∆2u − τ ∆u = λu,

∆u = ∂∆u

∂ν = 0,

in Ω,
on ∂Ω.

(12)

It is easy to see that problem (12) has an inﬁnite dimensional kernel since all harmonic func-
tions belong to the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue λ = 0. In particular, the boundary
conditions do not satisfy the complementing conditions, see [1, 27]. We refer to [42] for consid-
erations on the spectrum of problem (12).

3 Analyticity of the eigenvalues and Hadamard formulas

The study of the dependence of the eigenvalues of elliptic operators on the domain has
nowadays become a classical problem in the ﬁeld of perturbation theory. Shape continuity
of the eigenvalues has been known for long time ([23]), and can also be improved to H¨older
or Lipschitz continuity using stability estimates as in [8, 17, 18, 19, 20]. However, while the
continuity holds for all the eigenvalues, only the simple ones enjoy an analytic dependence
(see e.g., [30]). On the other hand, when the eigenvalue is multiple, bifurcation phenomena
occur, so that, if the perturbation is parametrized by one real variable, then the eigenvalues
are described by suitable analytic branches (cf. [44, Theorem 1]). Unfortunately, if the family
of perturbations is not parametrized by one real variable, one cannot expect the eigenvalues to
split into analytic branches anymore. In this case, the use of elementary symmetric functions
of the eigenvalues (see [35, 37]) has the advantage of bypassing splitting phenomena, in fact
such functions turn out to be analytic.

To this end, we shall consider problem (10) in a family of open sets parametrized by suitable

diﬀeomorphisms φ deﬁned on a bounded open set Ω in RN of class C1. Namely, we set

AΩ = (cid:26)φ ∈ C2(Ω ; RN ) :

|φ(x1) − φ(x2)|

|x1 − x2|

> 0(cid:27),

inf

x1,x2∈Ω

x16=x2

where C2(Ω ; RN ) denotes the space of all functions from Ω to RN of class C2. Note that
if φ ∈ AΩ then φ is injective, Lipschitz continuous and inf Ω |det∇φ| > 0. Moreover, φ(Ω)
is a bounded open set of class C1 and the inverse map φ(−1) belongs to Aφ(Ω). Thus it is
natural to consider problem (10) on φ(Ω) and study the dependence of λk[φ(Ω)] on φ ∈ AΩ.
To do so, we endow the space C2(Ω ; RN ) with its usual norm. Note that AΩ is an open set in
C2(Ω ; RN ), see [35, Lemma 3.11]. Thus, it makes sense to study diﬀerentiability and analyticity
properties of the maps φ 7→ λk[φ(Ω)] deﬁned for φ ∈ AΩ. For simplicity, we write λk[φ] instead
of λk[φ(Ω)]. We ﬁx a ﬁnite set of indexes F ⊂ N and we consider those maps φ ∈ AΩ for
which the eigenvalues with indexes in F do not coincide with eigenvalues with indexes not in
F ; namely we set

AF,Ω = {φ ∈ AΩ : λk[φ] 6= λl[φ], ∀ k ∈ F, l ∈ N \ F } .

It is also convenient to consider those maps φ ∈ AF,Ω such that all the eigenvalues with index
in F coincide and set

ΘF,Ω = {φ ∈ AF,Ω : λk1 [φ] = λk2 [φ], ∀ k1, k2 ∈ F } .

For φ ∈ AF,Ω, the elementary symmetric functions of the eigenvalues with index in F are

deﬁned by

ΛF,s[φ] = Xk1,...,ks∈F

k1<···<ks

λk1 [φ] · · · λks [φ],

s = 1, . . . , |F |.

We have the following

Theorem 3. Let Ω be a bounded open set in RN of class C1, τ > 0, − 1
N −1 < σ < 1, and F be
a ﬁnite set in N. The set AF,Ω is open in AΩ, and the real-valued maps ΛF,s are real-analytic
on AF,Ω, for all s = 1, . . . , |F |. Moreover, if ˜φ ∈ ΘF,Ω is such that the eigenvalues λk[ ˜φ] assume
the common value λF [ ˜φ] for all k ∈ F , and ˜φ(Ω) is of class C4 then the Fr´echet diﬀerential of
the map ΛF,s at the point ˜φ is delivered by the formula

associated with λF [ ˜φ] (the orthonormality being taken with respect to (7)), and:

• G(v) = −(cid:16) ∂ 2v

where by K we denote the mean curvature of ∂ ˜φ(Ω).

Proof. For the proof of the ﬁrst part of the theorem we refer to [11, Theorem 3.1] (see also [35]).
Concerning formula (13), we start by recalling that, for φ ∈ AΩ, we have that the pull-back of
the operator M is deﬁned by

M [u][v] = ZΩ

D2(u ◦ φ−1) : D2(v ◦ φ−1)| det Dφ|dx,

for any u, v ∈ V (Ω), and similarly also for B, L, P, Ji and Ti. We have

d|φ= ˜φΛF,s[ψ] = −λs+1

F [ ˜φ](cid:18)|F | − 1

s − 1 (cid:19)Xl∈F

P ˜φhd|φ= ˜φTi,φ[ψ][ul]ihuli

for all ψ ∈ C2( ¯Ω ; RN ) (cf. [35, proof of Theorem 3.38]), where ul = vl ◦ ˜φ for all l ∈ F . Note
also that by standard regularity theory (see e.g., [27, Theorem 2.20]) vl ∈ H 4( ˜φ(Ω)) for all
l ∈ F .

By standard calculus we have

P ˜φhd|φ= ˜φTi,φ[ψ][ul]ihuli = d|φ= ˜φJi,φ[ψ][ul][ul] − λ−1

F [ ˜φ]d|φ= ˜φPφ[ψ][ul][ul].

Applying Lemmas 7 and 8, we obtain formula (13).

7

We note that formula (13) for the Dirichlet problem was already obtained in [40] using
diﬀerent techniques, but only for simple eigenvalues. We also remark that some of the speciﬁc
cases of formula (13) were already obtained in [11, 12, 14, 15, 16]. In particular, in [12] it was
derived a diﬀerent formula for the Navier problem, which was later shown to be equivalent to
the one proposed here (see [8, 14]).

4 Shape optimization and isovolumetric perturbations

Important shape optimization problems for the eigenvalues of elliptic operators were already
addressed in [43], where the author claims that among all bounded domains in R2 of given area,
the ball minimizes the ﬁrst eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian and Bilaplacian, namely

λ1(Ω) ≥ λ1(Ω∗),

(14)

where Ω∗ is a ball with |Ω| = |Ω∗|. He does not provide any proof of inequality (14), claiming
it trivial for physical evidence. The actual proof of inequality (14), in the case of the Dirichlet
Laplacian, is due to Faber [26] and Krahn [31], and was then followed by similar inequalities
for the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator subject to other boundary conditions. We refer to
[29] for an extensive discussion on the topic.

On the other hand, in the case of the biharmonic operator inequality (14) is instead still
an open problem and is known as the Rayleigh conjecture.
It has been proved only in low
dimension, namely N = 2, 3, by Nadirashvili [39] and Ashbaugh and Benguria [3] improving
an argument due to Talenti [46]. Unfortunately, such an argument does not seem to work in
higher dimension. Regarding other boundary conditions, similar inequalities have been derived
for the Neumann problem (1), (4) and for the Steklov problem (6), also in quantitative form
(see [10, 15, 16, 21, 22]), showing that in such cases the ball is actually the maximizer. The
Steklov problem (5) is instead the only one in which the ball has been shown not to be the
optimizer for the ﬁrst eigenvalue (cf. [33]).

Here we consider the following shape optimization problems for the symmetric functions of

the eigenvalues

min

V [φ]=const

ΛF,s[φ]

or

max

V [φ]=const

ΛF,s[φ],

(15)

where V is the real valued function deﬁned on AΩ which takes φ ∈ AΩ to V [φ] = |φ(Ω)|. Note
that if ˜φ ∈ AΩ is a minimizer or maximizer in (15) then ˜φ is a critical domain transformation
for the map φ 7→ ΛF,s[φ] subject to volume constraint, i.e.,

Ker d|φ= ˜φV ⊂ Ker d|φ= ˜φΛF,s.

The following theorem provides a characterization of all critical domain transformations φ

(see also [11, 12, 13, 15, 36]).

Theorem 4. Let Ω be a bounded open set in RN of class C1, and F be a ﬁnite subset of N.
Assume that ˜φ ∈ ΘF,Ω is such that ˜φ(Ω) is of class C4 and that the eigenvalues λj [ ˜φ] have the
common value λF [ ˜φ] for all j ∈ F . Let {vl}l∈F be an orthornormal basis in V ( ˜φ(Ω)) of the
eigenspace corresponding to λF [ ˜φ] (the orthonormality being taken with respect to (7)). Then

8

˜φ is a critical domain transformation for any of the functions ΛF,s, s = 1, . . . , |F |, with volume
constraint if and only if there exists c ∈ R such that

|F |

Xl=1

G(vl) = c, on ∂ ˜φ(Ω).

(16)

Proof. The proof is a straightforward application of Lagrange Multipliers Theorem combined
with formula (13).

As we have said, balls play a relevant role in the shape optimization of the eigenvalues of
the Laplace and biharmonic operators. Hence we need to analyze in more details the behavior
of the eigenfunctions on balls. We have the following result (cf. [15, Lemma 4.22]).

Theorem 5. Let B be a ball in RN centered at zero, and let λ be an eigenvalue of problem
(10) in B. Let F be the subset of N of all j such that the j-th eigenvalue of problem (10) in
B coincides with λ. Let v1, . . . , v|F | be an orthonormal basis of the eigenspace associated with
the eigenvalue λ, where the orthonormality is taken with respect to the scalar product in V (B).

Proof. First of all, note that by standard regularity theory (see e.g., [1, 27]), the functions
vj ∈ C∞(B) for all j ∈ F .

Let ON (R) denote the group of orthogonal linear transformations in RN . Since the operators
P and Ji, i = 1, 2, 3 are invariant under rotations, then vk ◦ R, where R ∈ ON (R), is still an
eigenfunction with eigenvalue λ; moreover, {vj ◦R : j = 1, . . . , |F |} is another orthonormal basis
for the eigenspace associate with λ. Since both {vj : j = 1, . . . , |F |} and {vj ◦ R : j = 1, . . . , |F |}
are orthonormal bases, then there exists A[R] ∈ ON (R) with matrix (Aij [R])i,j=1,...,|F | such that

This implies that

For rotation invariant operators such as the Laplace or the biharmonic operator, it is easy
to show that any eigenfunction associated with a simple eigenvalue is radial. Theorem 5 tells
us that, when dealing with a multiple eigenvalue, we cannot consider the eigenfunctions alone,
but we have to consider the whole eigenspace. In particular, this is very useful when coupled
with condition (16).
Theorem 6. Let Ω be a domain in RN of class C1. Let ˜φ ∈ AΩ be such that ˜φ(Ω) is a ball. Let
˜λ be an eigenvalue of problem (10) in ˜φ(Ω), and let F be the set of j ∈ N such that λj [ ˜φ] = ˜λ.
Then ˜φ is a critical point ΛF,s under volume constraint, for all s = 1, . . . , |F |.

Proof. Thanks to Theorem 5, it remains to prove that, for problems (1), (3) and (8), the
function

In general, balls are expected to be the extremizer of problems of the type (15) only when
the ﬁrst eigenvalue is involved (see e.g., [29]), and even in this case problem (5) shows up as
a counterexample. Nevertheless, thanks to Theorem 6, we know that balls still are critical
domains for all the eigenvalues. It also would be interesting to characterize the family of open
sets ˜φ(Ω) such that condition (16) is satisﬁed. The only result in this direction is due to
Dalmasso [24], who proved that the ball is the only domain satisfying condition (16) for the
ﬁrst eigenvalue of the biharmonic operator subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions under the
additional hypotesis that the ﬁrst eigenfunction does not change sign.

5 Some technical lemmas

In this section we prove two lemmas that has been used in the proof of Theorem 3.

Lemma 7. Let Ω be a bounded domain in RN of class C1, and let ˜φ ∈ A2
Ω be such that ˜φ(Ω)
is of class C2. Let u1, u2 ∈ H 2(Ω) be such that v1 = u1 ◦ ˜φ−1, v2 = u2 ◦ ˜φ−1 ∈ H 4( ˜φ(Ω)). Then

Proof. First of all, we observe that the proof of (18) and of (20) can be done following that of
[15, Lemma 4.4] (we also refer to [8, Lemmas 2.4 and 2.6]). As for (19), we have (see also [8,
Lemma 2.5])

(21)

and we note that, by the equality

h(cid:16)d|φ= ˜φ (det∇φ) [ψ](cid:17) ◦ ˜φ(−1)i det∇ ˜φ(−1) = div(cid:16)ψ ◦ ˜φ(−1)(cid:17) ,
