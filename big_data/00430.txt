Abstract

We establish in this article spreading properties for the solutions of equations of
the type ∂tu − a(x)∂xxu − q(x)∂xu = f (x, u), where a, q, f are only assumed to be
uniformly continuous and bounded in x, the nonlinearity f is of monostable KPP
type between two steady states 0 and 1 and the initial datum is compactly sup-
ported. Using homogenization techniques, we construct two speeds w ≤ w such that
limt→+∞ sup0≤x≤wt |u(t, x)−1| = 0 for all w ∈ (0, w) and limt→+∞ supx≥wt |u(t, x)| = 0
for all w > w. These speeds are characterized in terms of two new notions of generalized
principal eigenvalues for linear elliptic operators in unbounded domains. In particu-
lar, we derive the exact spreading speed when the coeﬃcients are random stationary
ergodic, almost periodic or asymptotically almost periodic (where w = w).

Introduction

In the present paper, we investigate the large time behaviour of the solutions of the Cauchy
problem:

(cid:26) ∂tu − a(x)∂xxu − q(x)∂xu = f (x, u)

u(0, x) = u0(x)

in
for all

(0,∞) × R,
x ∈ R.

(1)

where the coeﬃcients a, q and f are assumed to be uniformly continuous and bounded in
x, with inf x∈R a(x) > 0, the constants 0 and 1 are steady states of (1) and the reaction
term f is supposed to be monostable between 0 and 1. This will be made more precise
later in a general framework. A typical example of nonlinearity satisfying our hypotheses
is f (x, s) = c(x)s(1 − s) with c bounded and inf R c > 0. We consider compactly supported
initial data u0 with 0 ≤ u0 ≤ 1 and u0 6≡ 0.
We underline that we do not make any other structural assumption in general on the
dependence in x of the coeﬃcients, such as periodicity, almost periodicity or ergodicity for
examples. The results we present is this paper are true for general heterogeneous coeﬃcients.
We only investigate here the one-dimensional and time-independent case. The multidi-
mensional and space-time heterogeneous framework requires a much more involved analysis
and will be investigated in our forthcoming work [8].

Equation (1) is indeed a heterogeneous generalization of the classical homogeneous equa-

tion

(2)
where f (0) = f (1) = 0 and f (s) > 0 if s ∈ (0, 1). In the case where f ′(s) ≤ f ′(0) for all
s ∈ (0, 1), this equation is called the Fisher-KPP equation (from Fisher [14] and Kolmogorov,
Petrovsky and Piskunov [18]). It is a fundamental equation in models of genetics, ecology,
chemistry or combustion.

∂tu − ∂xxu = f (u),

A central question in these models is to determine precisely how the steady state 1 invades
the unstable one 0. In the homogeneous framework, Aronson and Weinberger [1] solved this
question. They proved that if lim inf s→0+ f (s)/s1+2/N > 0, then there exists w∗ > 0 such
that

(cid:26) for all w ∈ (0, w∗),

for all w > w∗,

limt→+∞ supx∈[0,wt)
limt→+∞ supx≥wt

|u(t, x) − 1| = 0,
= 0.
|u(t, x)|

(3)

Naturally, a similar result holds for x ≤ 0. An immediate corollary of (3) is that
limt→+∞ u(t, x + wt) = 0 if w > w∗ and limt→+∞ u(t, x + wt) = 1 if 0 ≤ w < w∗ lo-
cally in x ∈ R. Thus, at large times an observer moving with speed w ≥ 0 will only see
the stable steady state 1 if w < w∗ and the unstable steady state 0 if w > w∗. We refer to
these results as spreading properties and we call the speed w∗ the spreading speed. It can
be proved that w∗ is the minimal speed of travelling waves solutions, deﬁned in [1, 14, 18].
If the nonlinear term f is of KPP type, that is, if f (s) ≤ f ′(0)s for all s ∈ (0, 1), then
properties for the general heterogeneous equation (1).

the spreading speed is explicitely given by w∗ = 2pf ′(0). Our goal is to prove spreading

Berestycki, Hamel and Nadirashvili [4, 6] investigated spreading properties in higher di-
mension for the homogeneous equation in general unbounded domains such as spirals, inﬁnite

2

combs or cusps, with Neumann boundary conditions. In such media, it is not always possible
to prove the existence of an exact spreading speed and several examples are constructed in
[6] where the spreading speed is inﬁnite or null. Although our present problem is diﬀerent
from that of [6], we expect to observe similar phenomena. As in [6], we are thus led to
introduce two speeds:

w∗ := sup{w ≥ 0,
w∗ := inf{w ≥ 0,

limt→+∞ sup0≤x≤wt
limt→+∞ supx≥wt

|u(t, x) − 1| = 0 },
= 0 }.

|u(t, x)|

(4)

We call these quantities respectively the lower and upper spreading speeds. To characterize
exactly w∗ and w∗ in general is still an open problem. The aim of the present paper is to
get accurate estimates on w∗ and w∗. That is, we want to construct w (resp. w) as large
as possible (resp. as small as possible) such that limt→+∞ sup0≤x≤wt |u(t, x) − 1| = 0 for all
w ∈ (0, w) (resp.
limt→+∞ supx≥wt |u(t, x)| = 0 for all w > w). In other words, we want to
ﬁnd w and w as close as possible such that

w ≤ w∗ ≤ w∗ ≤ w.

We underline that the speeds w∗ and w∗ are not necessarily equal: there might exist some
speeds w ∈ (w∗, w∗) such that the ω−limit set of t 7→ u(t, x + wt) is [0, 1] for all x ∈ R. An
explicit example has been investigated by Garnier, Giletti and the second author [17]. When
w∗ = w∗, we say that there exists an exact spreading speed. One of our aim is to identify
classes of equations for which there exists an exact spreading speed and to compute it.

In order to estimate w∗ and w∗, we will ﬁrst recall some known spreading properties for
some classes of heterogeneous equations. A more precise and comprehensive review of known
results on this topic will be given in our forthcoming work [8]. Here, we just mention the
cases of periodic or compactly supported spatial heterogeneities, which help to understand
our main result. We will also discuss the important class of random stationary ergodic
coeﬃcients in Section 2.4 below.

Consider ﬁrst a compactly supported heterogeneity: a ≡ 1, q ≡ 0 and

f (x, s) =(cid:0)b0 − b(x)(cid:1)s(1 − s) with b0 > 0,
Then it easily follows from Theorem 1.5 of [3] that w∗ ≥ 2√b0. It is also easy to check that
w∗ ≤ 2√b0 since f (x, s) ≤ b0s(1 − s). Thus

b smooth and compactly supported.

b ≥ 0,

w∗ = w∗ = 2pb0

in this case. This example shows that only what happens at inﬁnity matters to determine
w∗ and w∗.

Next, consider the case where all the coeﬃcients a, q and f are periodic in x. A function
h = h(x) is called L−periodic if h(x) = h(x + L) for all x ∈ R. The period L > 0 will
It has been proved using various approaches that the spreading

property (3) still holds in this case [3, 15, 16, 29]. When f is of KPP type, that is, when
f (x, s) ≤ f ′
s(x, 0)s for all (x, s) ∈ R × [0, 1], it is possible to characterize w∗ in terms of

3

periodic principal eigenvalues. In this framework, one often speaks of pulled fronts since the
propagation speed is determined by the linearization near the unstable steady state u ≡ 0.
Let now describe the eigenvalues that come up in the characterization of the spreading speed.

Let  L the elliptic operator associated with the linearized equation near 0:

 Lφ := a(x)φ′′ + q(x)φ′ + f ′

s(x, 0)φ,

and Lpφ := e−px L(epxφ) for all p ∈ R. Note that Lp has periodic coeﬃcients. Hence, we
know from the Krein-Rutman theory that it admits a periodic principal eigenvalue kper

The characterization of the spreading speed w∗ proved in [3, 15, 16, 29] then reads

This speed is also known to be the minimal speed of pulsating travelling waves [5].

Going back to the general case, from these examples we see that in order to ﬁnd sharp

estimates of w∗ and w∗, we need to take into account two aspects.
• Only the behaviour of the operator for large x should matter.
• This behaviour should be characterized through some notion of “principal eigenvalue”

of the linearized elliptic operator near u = 0.

2 Statement of the results

2.1 Hypotheses

We shall assume throughout the paper that a, q and f (·, s) are uniformly continuous and uni-
formly bounded with respect to x ∈ R, uniformly in s ∈ [0, 1]. The function f : R×[0, 1] → R
is of class C1+γ with respect to s, uniformly in x ∈ R, with β > 0 and 0 < γ < 1. We also
assume that for all x ∈ R:

f (x, 0) = f (x, 1) = 0 and inf
x∈R

f (x, s) > 0 if s ∈ (0, 1).

Thus, 0 and 1 are steady states of (1). Here, we consider nonlinear terms of KPP type:

f (x, s) ≤ f ′

s(x, 0)s for all (x, s) ∈ R × [0, 1].

(7)

(8)

The diﬀusion coeﬃcient a is supposed to be uniformly positive:
require the following condition:

inf x∈R a(x) > 0. We also

lim inf

|x|→+∞(cid:16)4f ′

s(x, 0)a(x) − q(x)2(cid:17) > 0.

4

(9)

This last condition implies, in a sense, that the problem is of monostable (or Fisher-KPP)
nature. Indeed, if u0 is a non-null initial datum such that 0 ≤ u0 ≤ 1, then by (7) and (9)
the solution u = u(t, x) of (1) converges to 1 as t → +∞ locally in x ∈ R [3, 7]. In other
words, 0 is an unstable steady state whereas the steady state 1 is globally attractive. Note
that if q ≡ 0 and f (x, u) = c(x)u(1 − u), with inf R c(x) > 0, then hypotheses (7), (8) and
(9) are satisﬁed.
These assumptions actually correspond to more general situations with heteroge-
nous steady states p− = p−(x) and p+ = p+(x) instead of 0 and 1.
Indeed, un-
der the conditions inf R(p+ − p−) > 0 and p+ − p− bounded, the change of variables
states into an equation with steady states 0 and 1. Thus there is no loss of generality in
assuming p− ≡ 0 and p+ ≡ 1 as soon as inf R(p+ − p−) > 0 and p+ − p− is bounded.

eu(t, x) =(cid:0)u(t, x) − p−(x)(cid:1)/(cid:0)p+(x) − p−(x)(cid:1) reduces the equation with heterogeneous steady

2.2 The main tool: generalized principal eigenvalues

In order to estimate w∗ and w∗, we know that one should characterize the heterogeneity
of the coeﬃcients through some notion of principal eigenvalues associated with the elliptic
operators deﬁned for all φ ∈ C2(R) and p ∈ R by
s(x, 0)φ

 Lφ := a(x)φ′′ + q(x)φ′ + f ′

and Lpφ := e−px L(cid:0)epxφ(cid:1).

These operators are associated with the linearization near the unstable steady state 0 of
equation (1). As a, q and f are just assumed to be uniformly continuous and bounded, with
no other assumption such as periodicity for example, these operators are not compact and
thus classical eigenvalues do not exist in general. In order to overcome this diﬃculty, we
need to introduce a generalized notion of principal eigenvalues.

Deﬁnition 2.1 The generalized principal eigenvalues associated with operator Lp in
the interval (R,∞) ⊂ R, with R ∈ {−∞} ∪ R, are:

λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) := sup(cid:8)λ | ∃φ ∈ AR such that Lpφ ≥ λφ in (R,∞)(cid:9),
λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) := inf(cid:8)λ | ∃φ ∈ AR such that Lpφ ≤ λφ in (R,∞)(cid:9),

where if R ∈ R, AR is the set of admissible test-functions over (R,∞):

and A−∞ is the set of admissible test-functions over R:

ln φ(x) = 0 (cid:9),
ln φ(x) = 0(cid:9).

Similar quantities have been introduced by Berestycki, Nirenberg and Varadhan [9] for
multidimensional bounded domains with a non-smooth boundary and by Berestycki, Hamel
and Rossi in [7] in unbounded domains (see also [10, 11]). These quantities are involved in
the statement of many properties of parabolic and elliptic equations in unbounded domains,
such as maximum principles, existence and uniqueness results [7, 10, 11]. The main diﬀerence
1
with [7, 9, 10, 11] is that here we impose limx→+∞
x ln φ(x) = 0 instead of asking some bounds
from above or below on the test-functions. This milder constraint on the test-functions was
motivated by the class of random stationary ergodic coeﬃcients, for which one can almost
surely construct eigenfunctions that are unbounded but satisfy limx→+∞

1
x ln φ(x) = 0.

Although Deﬁnition 2.1 is quite simple, these generalized principal eigenvalues are uneasy
to handle. Several properties of these quantities will be proved in Section 3. Let only mention
here the following result, which proves that if there exists a positive eigenvalue in AR, then
the two generalized principal eigenvalues correspond to the classical notion. This property
will be used several times in the sequel to prove spreading properties in periodic, almost
periodic and random stationary ergodic media.

Proposition 2.2 Let p ∈ R. Assume that there exist λ ∈ R, R ∈ {−∞} ∪ R and φ ∈ AR
such that Lpφ = λφ in (R,∞). Then,

λ = λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) = λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1).

2.3 Statement of the results
In order to construct w and w as precisely as possible such that w ≤ w∗ ≤ w∗ ≤ w, we
know that only the heterogeneity of the coeﬃcients for large x matters. Let thus deﬁne for
all p ∈ R:

H(p) := lim

R→+∞

λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) and H(p) := lim

R→+∞

λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1).

(14)

Note that these limits are well-deﬁned since one can easily prove that R 7→ λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1)
is nonincreasing and R 7→ λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) is nondecreasing. The properties of H and H are

gathered in the next Proposition.

Proposition 2.3 The functions H and H are locally Lipschitz-continuous. Moreover, there
exist C ≥ c > 0 such that for all p ∈ R : c(1 + |p|2) ≤ H(p) ≤ H(p) ≤ C(1 + |p|2).

We are now in position to deﬁne our speeds w and w:

w := min
p>0

H(−p)

p

and w := min
p>0

H(−p)

p

.

(15)

Our main result is the following.

Theorem 2.1 Take u0 a measurable and compactly supported function such that 0 ≤ u0 ≤ 1,
u0 6≡ 0 and let u the solution of the associated Cauchy problem (1). One has

6

1. for all w > w, limt→+∞ supx≥wt |u(t, x)| = 0,
2. for all w ∈ [0, w), limt→+∞ sup0≤x≤wt |u(t, x) − 1| = 0.
In other words, one has w ≤ w∗ ≤ w∗ ≤ w.

In order to check the optimality of our
constructions of w and w, we will now prove that all the previously known results can be
derived from Theorem 2.1. Moreover, we will show that w = w in various types of media for
which no spreading properties have been proved before.

It is not always true that w = w since this would imply w∗ = w∗, that is, the existence of
an exact spreading speed. But we know from [17] that w∗ < w∗ for some classes of equations.
Theorem 2.1 would be completely optimal if one was able to prove that w = w∗ and w = w∗
are always satisﬁed, for example by proving that t 7→ u(t, wt) does not converge as t → +∞
for all w ∈ (w, w). We leave this question as an open problem.
If Theorem 2.1 was not
optimal, then the next step would be the improvement of the deﬁnitions of our estimates
w and w in order to increase w and to decrease w. In particular, we do not know whether
our choice of the set of admissible test-functions AR is optimal or not. Maybe taking into
account more general behaviours of the test-functions at inﬁnity could give more accurate
estimates on the spreading speeds.

2.4 Derivation of earlier results

This Section is devoted to some applications of Theorem 2.1. In particular, we are interested
in situations where w = w. We ﬁrst prove that when the heterogeneity is homogeneous,
periodic, compactly supported or random stationary ergodic, we recover the known spreading
properties. Then, we show in the next section how to derive new results when the coeﬃcients
are almost periodic or asymptotically almost periodic. We also mention the class of slowly
oscillating coeﬃcients, treated in [17].

Homogeneous coeﬃcients

Assume ﬁrst that the coeﬃcients are homogeneous, that is, a, q and f do not depend on x.
Take a ≡ 1 and q ≡ 0 in order to simplify the computations. In this case  Lφ = φ′′ + f ′(0)φ
and Lpφ = φ′′ + 2pφ′ + (p2 + f ′(0))φ. It immediatly follows from Proposition 2.2 that, taking

φ ≡ 1 as a test-function, λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) = λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) = p2 +f ′(0) for all R ∈ R. Hence,
for all p ∈ R. We conclude that w = w = 2pf ′(0). This is consistent with Aronson and

H(p) = H(p) = p2 + f ′(0)

Weinberger’s result [1].

Periodic coeﬃcients

Assume now that the coeﬃcients are periodic. The existence of an exact spreading speed is
already known in this case [3, 15, 16, 29]. We now explain how one can derive this classical
result from Theorem 2.1.

7

We know that the operator Lp admits a unique periodic principal eigenvalue kper

p deﬁned
by (5), associated with a periodic principal eigenfunction φ. As φ is periodic, continuous and
positive, it is bounded and has a positive inﬁmum. Thus φ ∈ AR for all R ∈ R and Propo-
for
all p ∈ R and

sition 2.2 gives λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) = λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) = kper

. This gives H(p) = H(p) = kper

p

−p

,

w = w = min
p>0

which is consistent with [3, 15, 16, 29].

Compactly supported heterogeneity

Assume now that f ′
s(x, 0) = b0 + b(x) for all x ∈ R, where b0 > 0 and b is a compactly
supported and continuous function. Assume that a ≡ 1 and q ≡ 0 in order to sim-
plify the presentation. Assume that b(x) = 0 for all |x| ≥ r. Then for all R > r and
φ ∈ AR, one has Lpφ = φ′′ + 2pφ′ + (p2 + b0)φ in (R,∞). Thus, Proposition 2.2 gives

λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) = λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) = p2 + b0. Hence H(p) = H(p) = p2 + b0 and

w = w = w∗ = w∗ = 2pb0.

This is consistent with the result we derived from [3] in the Introduction and even slightly
more general since we make no negativity assumption on b.

A generalization of the notion of waves has recently been given by the ﬁrst author and
Hamel [2]. One can wonder if the speeds w∗ and w∗ can be viewed as the minimal speed of
existence of waves, as in the homogeneous or periodic cases. In fact, it has been proved by
Nolen, Roquejoﬀre, Ryzhik and Zlatos [24] that one can construct some compactly supported
heterogeneities such that the associated equation admits no generalized transition waves.
Hence, for such heterogeneities, spreading properties hold with speed w∗ = w∗ = 2√b0 but
generalized transition waves do not exist.

Random stationary ergodic coeﬃcients

We now consider a probability space (Ø, P,F ) and we assume that the reaction rate
f : (x, ω, s) ∈ R × Ø × [0, 1] → R and the diﬀusion term a : (x, ω) ∈ R × Ø → (0,∞)
are random variables. We assume that q ≡ a′, that is, equation (1) is in the divergence
form. We suppose that a(·, ω), a′(·, ω), 1/a(·, ω), f (·, ω, s) and f ′
s(·, ω, 0) are almost surely
uniformly continuous and bounded with respect to x uniformly in s, that f is of class C1+γ
with respect to s uniformly in x, that f (x, ω, s) ≤ f ′
s(x, ω, 0)s for all (x, ω, s) ∈ R× Ø× [0, 1].
The functions f ′
s(·,·, 0) and a are assumed to be random stationary ergodic. This last hy-
pothesis means that there exists a group (πx)x∈R of measure-preserving transformations such
that a(x + y, ω) = a(x, πyω) and f ′
s(x, πyω, 0) for all (x, y, ω) ∈ R × R × Ø
and if πxA = A for all x ∈ R and for a given A ∈ F , then P(A) = 0 or 1. This hypothesis
heuristically means that the statistical properties of the medium does not depend on the
place where one observes it.

s(x + y, ω, 0) = f ′

We expect to compute the speeds w and w for almost every ω ∈ Ø. Such a result is already
known when the full nonlinearity f (and not only its derivative near u = 0) is a random

8

stationary ergodic function since the pioneering work of Freidlin and Gartner [16]. They
proved that for almost every ω ∈ Ø, one has w∗ = w∗ and that this exact spreading speed
can be computed using a family of Lyapounov exponents associated with the linearization
of the equation near u = 0. This result has been generalized by Nolen and Xin to various
types of space-time random stationary ergodic equations [25, 26, 27].

Our aim is to check that it is possible to derive w = w almost surely from Theorem
2.1 and to ﬁnd a characterization of the exact spreading speed that involves the generalized
principal eigenvalues. The linearized operator now depends on the event ω and we write for
all ω ∈ Ø, p ∈ R and φ ∈ C2(R):

Lω

p φ :=(cid:0)a(x, ω)φ′(cid:1)′

+ 2pa(x, ω)φ′ +(cid:0)p2a(x, ω) + pa′(x, ω) + f ′

s(x, ω)(cid:1)φ.

ω

We associate with these operators two Hamiltonians H ω , H
wω and wω through (15).

(16)

through (14) and two speeds

Proposition 2.4 Under the hypotheses stated above, there exists a measurable set Ø0, with
P(Ø0) = 1, such that for all ω ∈ Ø0:

wω = wω = min
p>0

λ1(Lω
−p, R)
p

= min
p>0

λ1(Lω
−p, R)
p

(17)

and this quantity does not depend on ω ∈ Ø0.

Hence, the identity wω = wω, which was already known [15, 16], can be derived from
Theorem 2.1. Moreover, we obtain a new characterization of this exact spreading speed
involving generalized principal eigenvalues instead the Lyapounov exponents used in [15, 16].
The proof of Proposition 2.4 relies on the equality of the generalized principal eigenvalues.

Theorem 2.2 There exists a measurable set Ø0, with P(Ø0) = 1, such that for all p ∈ R
and ω ∈ Ø0:

λ1(Lω

and this quantity does not depend on ω ∈ Ø0.

2.5 Applications to further frameworks and new results

We have shown in the previous Section how to recover all the previously known results on
spreading properties using Theorem 2.1. We will now apply Theorem 2.1 to equations for
which no characterization of the exact spreading speed was available up to now.

Almost periodic coeﬃcients

We will use Bochner’s deﬁnition of almost periodic functions:

Deﬁnition 2.5 [12] A function g : R → R is almost periodic with respect to x ∈ R if
from any sequence (xn)n∈N in R one can extract a subsequence (xnk)k∈N such that g(xnk + x)
converges uniformly in x ∈ R.

This proposition is established here as a corollary of the following Theorem about gen-

eralized principal eigenvalues, which is new and of independent interest.

Theorem 2.4 Consider a function c : R → R. Assume that a, q and c are almost periodic.
Let  Lφ = a(x)φ′′ + q(x)φ′ + c(x)φ. Then one has λ1(L, R) = λ1(L, R).

It has been shown by Papanicolaou and Varadhan [28] that almost periodic functions
can be considered as random stationary ergodic ones, with an appropriate probability space
(Ø,F , P). Roughly speaking, Ø is the closure for the uniform convergence of all the trans-
lations of the almost periodic coeﬃcients (see [28] for a precise construction). Thus, one
could try to apply Theorem 2.2 in order to derive Theorem 2.4. However, one would then
get a result for almost every ω ∈ Ø, meaning that this ﬁrst step may only give the result
for a translation at inﬁnity of the coeﬃcients. But then, even if such a translation is a
good approximation of the original coeﬃcients thanks to the almost periodicity, as we are
investigating large-time behaviours, it is not clear how to control such a behaviour using
this approximation. If only the reaction term f depends on x, then we believe that it is
possible to construct appropriate sub and supersolutions and to recover the existence of an
exact spreading speed using these arguments. But if the diﬀusion term a and the advection
term q depend on x, it seems that some additional and rather involved arguments should be
provided to derive the result not only for a translation at inﬁnity of the operator L but for
 L itself.
We use here a direct approach to prove Theorem 2.4. Namely, we construct appropriate

test-functions by using a result of Lions and Souganidis [20].

Asymptotically almost periodic coeﬃcients

When the coeﬃcients converge to almost periodic functions at inﬁnity, it is still possible to
prove that w = w. We underline that this result is completely new: the class of asymptoti-
cally almost periodic coeﬃcients has never been investigated before.

Proposition 2.6 Assume that there exist almost periodic functions a∗, q∗ and c∗ such that

where  L∗φ = a∗(x)φ′′ + q∗(x)φ′ + c∗(x)φ and L∗

Slowly oscilatting coeﬃcients

Lastly, let us mention that the method developed in the present paper has been used by
Garnier, Giletti and the second author [17] to investigate the case where a ≡ 1, q ≡ 0 and
f ′
s(x, 0) = µ0(φ(x)), with µ0 a periodic function and φ a smooth increasing function such
that φ′(x) → 0 as x → +∞. If φ increases suﬃciently fast, then these authors proved that
w∗ = w∗∗ and it is possible to compute this speed. We refer to [17] for a precise deﬁnition

of “suﬃciently fast”. An example of such a φ is φ(x) =(cid:0) ln(1 + |x|)(cid:1)α, α > 1. This result is
φ increases slowly(cid:0)for example, when φ(x) =(cid:0) ln(1 + |x|)(cid:1)α, α ∈ (0, 1)(cid:1), then it was proved

proved by constructing appropriate test-functions in the deﬁnition of the generalized principal
eigenvalues (10). As in the random stationary ergodic setting, it is necessary to consider test-
functions which are not necessarily bounded but satisfy 1
x ln φ(x) → 0 as |x| → +∞. When
in [17] that w∗ = 2√minR µ0 and w∗ = 2√maxR µ0, which provides an example of coeﬃcients
for which w∗ < w∗.

3 Properties of the generalized principal eigenvalues

The aim of this Section is to state some basic properties of the generalized principal eigen-
values and to prove Proposition 2.3. In all the Section, we ﬁx an operator  L deﬁned for all
φ ∈ C2 by

 Lφ := a(x)φ′′ + q(x)φ′ + c(x)φ,

where a, q and c are given continuous and uniformly continuous functions over R and
inf x∈R a(x) > 0. We do not require the coeﬃcients to be uniformly continuous in this
Section.

3.1 Comparison between λ1 and λ1

We begin with an inequality between λ1 and λ1.

Proposition 3.1 For all R ∈ {−∞} ∪ R, one has

λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1) ≥ λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1).

This comparison result may seem very close to Theorem 1.7 in [11]. It is not: the test-
functions we use here are very diﬀerent from that of [11], which were assumed to be either
bounded or of positive inﬁmum and to satisfy some boundary condition in x = R. Here,
1
our condition limx→+∞
x ln φ(x) = 0 is milder since φ could be unbounded and thus the
maximum principle of Deﬁnition 1.5 in [11] does not apply. Moreover, we do not impose any
condition at x = R and thus we have no a priori comparison on the test-functions involved
in the deﬁnitions of λ1 and λ1. We thus need to use a diﬀerent method to prove the result,
which relies on the following technical Lemma.

Lemma 3.2 For all R ∈ R, there exists no function z ∈ C2(cid:0)(R,∞)(cid:1)∩C1(cid:0)[R,∞)(cid:1) such that

x ln z(x) = 0, z > 0 in [R,∞) and

limx→+∞

1

− a(x)z′′ − q(x)z′ ≥ εz in (R,∞), with ε > 0.

(21)

Proof. Assume by translation that R = 0 in order to enlight the notations.

First case: z′(0) < 0. Let zκ(x) = eκxz(x) for all x > 0, where κ ∈(cid:0)0,−z′(0)/z(0)(cid:1) will be

chosen later. This function satisﬁes

− a(x)z′′

κ −(cid:0)q(x) − 2κa(x)(cid:1)z′

κ ≥(cid:0)ε − κq(x) − κ2a(x)(cid:1)zκ > 0 in (0,∞),

(22)

If x0 = 0, then z′

x ln z(x) = 0, this inﬁmum is reached at some x0 ≥ 0.

taking κ small enough. Let m := inf x∈[0,∞) zκ(x). As limx→+∞ zκ(x) = +∞ since
If x0 > 0, then a con-
limx→+∞
κ(0) = z′(0) + κz(0) ≥ 0, which is also a
tradiction follows from (22).
contradiction since our choice of κ gives z′(0) + κz(0) < 0.
z′(0) ≥ 0. Let zκ(x) = eκxz(x) for κ > 0 small enough so that
Second case:
ε − κq(x) − κ2a(x) > 0 for all x ∈ R. Equation (22) yields that zκ has no local mini-
mum. Hence, as limx→+∞ zκ(x) = +∞, the function zκ is nondecreasing. Letting κ → 0,
this gives z′(x) ≥ 0 for all x > 0. It follows from (21) that
− z′′ + Qz′ ≥ δz in (0,∞),
where δ := ε/ sup(0,∞) a and Q = max{kq/ak∞, 2√δ + 1}.

(23)

Let wh the unique solution of

h + Qw′

−w′′

h = δwh in (0, h), wh(0) = z(0), wh(h) = z(h).

This function is explicitly given by

wh = Aher−x + Bher+x

12

where r± = 1

2(cid:0)Q ±pQ2 − 4δ(cid:1) > 0 and

Ah =

z(h)e−r+h − z(0)
e(r−−r+)h − 1

and Bh = z(0) − Ah.

1

As limx→+∞
limh→+∞ Ah = z(0) and limh→+∞ Bh = 0.

x ln z(x) = 0 and r+ > r− > 0, one has z(h)e−r+h → 0 as h → +∞ and thus
Let σ := inf x∈[0,h],wh(x)6=0 z(x)/wh(x). This quantity is well-deﬁned since z is continuous
and positive. Assume by contradiction that σ < 1. Then one has z ≥ σwh in [0, h] and there
exists x0 ∈ [0, h] such that z(x0) = σwh(x0). As z(0) = wh(0), z(h) = wh(h) and σ < 1, one
has x0 ∈ (0, h). Thus, the function ζ := z − σwh is nonnegative and vanishes at the interior
point x0 ∈ (0, h). As it satisﬁes −ζ ′′ + Qζ ′ ≥ δζ, the strong elliptic maximum principle
implies ζ ≡ 0. This is a contradiction since ζ(0) = (1 − σ)z(0) > 0. Hence σ = 1, which
means that z ≥ wh in (0, h).

Letting h → +∞, we eventually get

which contradicts limx→+∞

1
x ln z(x) = 0.

(cid:3)

z(x) ≥ z(0)er−x for all x > 0,

Proof of Proposition 3.1. Assume by contradiction that λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1) > λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1),

where R ∈ R. Then there exist λ ∈ R and ε > 0 such that

λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1) > λ > λ − ε > λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1).

This yields that there exist φ, ψ ∈ AR such that  Lφ ≤ (λ − ε)φ and  Lψ ≥ λψ in (R,∞).
limx→+∞

Deﬁne z = φ/ψ. Then z ∈ C2(cid:0)(R,∞)(cid:1) ∩ C1(cid:0)[R,∞)(cid:1) is positive over [R,∞) and satisﬁes

1
x ln z(x) = 0. Moreover, one can easily check that z satisﬁes

a(x)z′′ +(cid:16)q(x) + 2a(x)

ψ′(x)

ψ(x)(cid:17)z′ ≤ −εz in (R,∞).

As ψ′/ψ ∈ L∞(cid:0)(R,∞)(cid:1) since ψ ∈ AR, Lemma 3.2 applies and gives a contradiction.

If R = −∞, one has for all r ∈ R,

λ1( L, R) ≤ λ1(cid:0) L, (r,∞)(cid:1) ≤ λ1(cid:0) L, (r,∞)(cid:1) ≤ λ1( L, R).

(cid:3)

3.2 Continuity with respect to the coeﬃcients

We now prove that the generalized principal eigenvalues are continuous with respect to the
coeﬃcients q and c. It is easy to see that λ1 and λ1 are Lipschitz-continuous with respect
to the zeroth order term of  L using the maximum principle. We improve this property here
and prove that it is also locally Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the ﬁrst order term.

Proposition 3.3 Consider two operators  L and  L′ deﬁned for all φ ∈ C2 by

 Lφ = a(x)φ′′ + q(x)φ′ + c(x)φ,
 L′φ = a(x)φ′′ + r(x)φ′ + d(x)φ,

where a, q, r, c and d are continuous and uniformly bounded functions over R and inf R a > 0.
Then, for all R ∈ R, the following inequalities hold

Remark: It is an open problem to prove that the generalized principal eigenvalues are
continuous with respect to the diﬀusion coeﬃcient a.

Let δ = kq − rk∞ and ε = kc − dk∞.

Proof. We use the same type of argument as in the proof of Proposition 5.1 in
For all constant M, one has
[9].

λ1( L+M, (R,∞)) = λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1)+M. Thus, adding a suﬃciently large M, one can assume
that c and d are positive functions and that λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1) > 0 and λ1( L′, (R,∞)) > 0.

Take κ > 0. There exists a function φ ∈ AR and

 Lφ = a(x)φ′′ + q(x)φ′ + c(x)φ ≥(cid:16)λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1) − κ(cid:17)φ in (R,∞).

Consider any α > 1 and deﬁne ψ = φα. One has ψ > 0 and limx→+∞

3.3 Comparison with the classical notion of eigenvalue

Proof of Proposition 2.2. As φ ∈ AR, one can take φ as a test-function in the deﬁnition
of λ1 and λ1, which gives

λ ≤ λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1) and λ ≥ λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1).

On the other hand, Proposition 3.1 yields λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1) ≤ λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1). This gives the

conclusion.

(cid:3)

3.4 Properties of H and H

We now gather all the previous results to prove Proposition 2.3.
Proof of Proposition 2.3. Recall that, for all p ∈ R,

Lpφ = e−px L(epxφ) = a(x)φ′′ +(cid:0)2pa(x) + q(x)(cid:1)φ′ +(cid:0)a(x)p2 + q(x)p + f ′

Proposition 3.3 and (24) give the local Lipschitz-continuity of H and H with respect to p.
Proposition 3.1 gives H ≥ H.

For all p ∈ R and R > 0, the inﬁmum of the zeroth order term of Lp over (R,∞) is

s(x, 0)(cid:1)φ.

(24)

s(x, 0)(cid:1). Thus, taking a constant test-

bounded from below by inf x>R(cid:0)a(x)p2 + q(x)p + f ′

function in the deﬁnition of λ1, one gets
λ1(Lp, (R,∞)) ≥ inf

Taking the inﬁmum over p ∈ R of this inequality, one gets

s(x, 0)(cid:1).
inf p∈R λ1(Lp, (R,∞)) ≥ inf x>R inf p∈R(cid:0)a(x)p2 + q(x)p + f ′
s(x, 0) − q(x)2/4a(x)(cid:1).
s(x, 0) − q(x)2/4a(x)(cid:1) > 0.

Hence, combining these two inequalities, one can ﬁnd a constant c > 0 such that for all

The other inequality is obtained in a similar way.

4 Proof of the spreading property

4.1 The convergence for w > w

We start with the proof of the convergence limt→+∞ supx≥wt u(t, x) = 0 for all w > w, which
is the easiest part.

Proof of Part 1. of Theorem 2.1. Take w > w. The deﬁnition (15) of w yields that

there exist p > 0 and R > 0 such that λ1(cid:0)L−p, (R,∞)(cid:1) < wp. Hence, there exist δ ∈ (0, wp)

and φ ∈ AR such that

(27)
Up to multiplication of φ by a positive constant, one can assume that φ(x)e−px ≥ u0(x) for
all x ∈ R and that φ(R)e−pR > 1 for all t > 0. Deﬁne

epx L(e−pxφ) ≤ (wp − δ)φ in (R,∞).

u(t, x) :=(cid:26)

1

min{1, φ(x)e−px+(wp−δ)t}

if
if

x ≤ R,
x > R.

This function is clearly continuous since φ(R)e−pR+(wp−δ)t ≥ φ(R)e−pR > 1 for all t ≥ 0.

Take now (t, x) ∈ (0,∞) × R such that u(t, x) < 1. As x > R, it follows from (27) that
∂tu − a(x)∂xxu − q(x)∂xu − f ′

s(x, 0)u =(cid:16) −  L(e−pxφ) + (wp − δ)e−pxφ(cid:17)e(wp−δ)t ≥ 0.

Hence, as the constant function 1 is a supersolution of the Cauchy problem (1), u is a weak su-
persolution of the Cauchy problem. The parabolic maximum principle yields u(t, x) ≥ u(t, x)
for all (t, x) ∈ (0,∞) × R. It follows from limx→+∞

x ln φ(x) = 0 that

as t → +∞.

4.2 The rescaled equation

In order to prove the convergence for w ∈ (0, w) in Theorem 2.1, we will ﬁrst determine
the limit of vε(t, x) := u(t/ε, x/ε) as ε → 0 by using homogenization techniques. To do
so, we follow the ideas developed by Majda and Souganidis in [22], which are based on
the half-limits method. There is indeed a deep link between homogenization problems and
spreading properties for reaction-diﬀusion equations. This link will be discussed in details in
our forthcoming work [8]. We also refer to [21] for a detailed discussion on homogenization
problems and on the existence of approximate correctors, a notion which is close to that of
generalized principal eigenvalues.

In the present framework, we need to overcome several new diﬃculties when trying to

apply the ideas of [22] due to the general heterogeneity of the coeﬃcients.

16

• First, classical eigenfunctions of the linearized operators Lp do not exist in general. In
[22], these eigenfunctions play the role of correctors. Here, the deﬁnitions of H and H
only give sub and super-correctors. As we use the half-limits method, this diﬃculty is
overcame by using these sub and super-correctors to prove that the half-limits are sub
and supersolutions of some Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Thus the generalized principal
eigenvalues are well-ﬁtted to our approach.

• Next, the initial datum becomes vε(0, x) = u0(x/ε), which depends on ε and converges
to 0 if x 6= 0 and to 1 if x = 0 when ε → 0. This singularity at x = 0 creates new
diﬃculties since no comparison results exist, as far as we know, for the limit equation
(34) on the phase Z∗. We will overcome this diﬃculty by getting estimates on the
phase Z∗ by hand.

• Lastly, we want to prove that only what happens in (R,∞) with large R plays a role

in the computations of H and H.

The authors are indebted to Jimmy Garnier and Thomas Giletti for a careful reading

and useful comments on this proof.

The proof starts as in [22]. Deﬁne

and let

Zε(t, x) := ε ln vε(t, x)

Z∗(t, x) := lim inf

(s,y)→(t,x),ε→0

Zε(s, y).

(28)

(29)

Our aim is to check that Z∗ is a supersolution of some Hamilton-Jacobi equation to be
determined.

The following Lemma ensures that the function Z∗ takes ﬁnite values for all t > 0, x > 0.

Lemma 4.1 The family (Zε)ε>0 satisﬁes the following properties:

i) For all t > 0, one has Z∗(t, 0) = 0.
ii) For all compact set Q ⊂ (0,∞) × R, there exist a constant C = C(Q) and ε0 = ε0(Q)

such that |Zε(t, x)| ≤ C for all 0 < ε < ε0 and (t, x) ∈ Q.

Proof.
i) We know from [3] that, as (9) is satisﬁed, there exists c > 0 such that

lim
t→+∞

inf
|x|≤ct

u(t, x) = 1.

Fix t0 > 0 such that inf |x|≤ct u(t, x) ≥ 1/2 for all t ≥ t0. Consider now t > 0 and a sequence
(sn, yn) ∈ R+ × RN such that sn → t and yn → 0 as n → +∞. Thus |yn|/sn ≤ c and
sn/ε ≥ t0 when n is large and ε is small. This yields

0 ≥ Z ε(sn, yn) = ε ln u(sn/ε, yn/ε) ≥ ε ln

inf

|x|≤csn/ε

u(sn/ε, x) ≥ −ε ln 2 → 0 as ε → 0.

Thus Z∗(t, 0) = 0.

17

ii) First, the Krylov-Safonov-Harnack inequality [19] yields that for any R ≤ 2, there

exists a constant C > 0, such that

∀|y| ≤ R/2,

∀s > 0,

u(s + R2, 0) ≤ Cu(s + 2R2, y).

Iterating this inequality, one gets for all N ∈ N\{0}:

∀|y| ≤ NR/2,

u(NR2, 0) ≤ C N u(2NR2, y).

(30)

Let now derive the local boundedness of Z∗ from this inequality. Take T > τ > 0, ρ > 0,
0) for

0)] the integer part of t/(2εR2

t ∈ (τ, T ) and |x| ≤ ρ. Let R0 := τ /8ρ and Nε := [t/(2εR2
deﬁnition of the integer part. Let y = x/ε. One has

any ε ∈ (0, 1). Deﬁne Rε :=pt/(2εNε). It is easily noticed that limε→0+ Rε = R0 using the

|y| = |x|
ε ≤

ρ
ε

=

τ
8εR0 ≤

τ

4εRε

for ε small enough, from which we get |y| ≤ NεRε/2 since t ≥ τ and NεR2
construction. Hence, we can apply inequality (30), which gives:

ε = t/2ε by

u(cid:0)t/(2ε), 0(cid:1) = u(NεR2

As Zε(t, x) = ε ln u(t/ε, x/ε), we get

ε, 0) ≤ C Nεu(2NεR2

ε, y) = C Nεu(t/ε, x/ε).

Zε(t/2, 0) ≤ εNε ln C + Zε(t, x).

(31)

Moreover, we know that

Hence, there exist ε0 > 0 and a constant, that we still denote C, such that for all ε ∈ (0, ε0),
t ∈ [τ, T ] and |x| ≤ ρ, one has

|Zε(t, x)| = −Zε(t, x) ≤ C − Zε(t/2, 0).

Step i) yields that limε→0+ Zε(t/2, 0) = 0 locally uniformly in t ∈ (τ, T ), which ends the
proof.

(cid:3)

The link between Z∗ and the convergence of vε as ε → 0 is given by the following Lemma:

Lemma 4.2 One has

lim inf

ε→0

vε(t, x) > 0 for all (t, x) ∈ int{Z∗ = 0}.

(32)

18

Proof. Fix (t0, x0) ∈ int{Z∗ = 0}. As u(t, x) → 1 as t → +∞ locally in x, one has
vε(t, 0) → 1 as ε → 0 for all t > 0. We thus assume that x0 6= 0. One has Z ε(t, x) → 0 as
ε → 0 uniformly in the neighborhood of (t0, x0). Deﬁne

φ(t, x) = −|x − x0|2 − |t − t0|2.

As Z∗ = 0 in the neighbourhood of (t0, x0) and φ is nonpositive, the function Zε − φ reaches
a minimum at a point (tε, xε), with (tε, xε) → (t0, x0) as ε → 0. Thus, the equation on Zε
(see (33) below) gives

∂tφ − εa∂xxφ − a(xε/ε)(∂xφ)2 − q(xε/ε)∂xφ − (vε)−1f (xε/ε, vε) ≥ 0,

where the derivatives of φ and vε are evaluated at (tε, xε). An explicit computation of the
left-hand side gives

(vε)−1f (xε/ε, vε(tε, xε)) ≤ o(1) at xε as ε → 0.

As f is of class C1+γ with respect to s uniformly in x, there exists C > 0 such that for all
(x, u) ∈ R × [0, 1],

f (x, u) ≥ f ′

s(x, 0)u − Cu1+γ.

This gives

Hypothesis (9) together with x0 > 0 give

ε→0

f ′
s(xε/ε, 0) > 0.

Thus lim inf ε→0 vε(tε, xε) > 0.

Next, the deﬁnition of (tε, xε) yields

Zε(t0, x0) = Zε(t0, x0) − ψ(t0, x0) ≥ Zε(tε, xε) − ψ(tε, xε) ≥ Zε(tε, xε).

It follows from the deﬁnition of Zε that

ε ln u(t0/ε, x0/ε) = ε ln vε(t0, x0) ≥ ε ln u(tε/ε, xε/ε) = ε ln vε(tε, xε).

Hence, vε(t0, x0) ≥ vε(tε, xε) and one gets lim inf ε→0 vε(t0, x0) > 0.

4.3 The equation on Z∗
In order to identify the set int{Z∗ = 0}, we prove in this Section that Z∗ is a supersolution
of some ﬁrst order Hamilton-Jacobi equation. As u satisﬁes (1), the deﬁnition of Zε yields
for all ε > 0:

∂tZε − εa(x/ε)∂xxZε − a(x/ε)(cid:0)∂xZε(cid:1)2 − q(x/ε)∂xZε =

Proposition 4.3 The function Z∗ is a lower semi-continuous viscosity solution of

(cid:26) max{∂tZ∗ − H(∂xZ∗), Z∗} ≥ 0 in (0,∞) × (0,∞),

Z∗(t, 0) = 0 for all t > 0.

Proof. As Z∗ ≤ 0 since u ≤ 1, we need to prove that

∂tZ∗ − H(∂xZ∗) ≥ 0 in {Z∗ < 0}.

(34)

(35)

Fix a smooth test function φ and assume that Z∗− φ admits a strict minimum at some point
(t0, x0) ∈ (0,∞)× (0,∞) over the ball Br := {(t, x) ∈ (0,∞)× (0,∞),|t− t0| +|x− x0| ≤ r},
with Z∗(t0, x0) < 0. Deﬁne p = ∂xφ(t0, x0). If we manage to prove that for all µ > 0,

∂tφ(t0, x0) − H(p) ≥ −µ,

then letting µ → 0+ would imply that Z∗ is a viscosity subsolution of (35).

Fix R > 0 and consider a function ψ ∈ AR such that(cid:16)Lp − λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1)(cid:17)ψ ≥ −µψ.

Let w = ln ψ, this function satisﬁes over (R,∞):

− a(x)(cid:0)w′′ + (w′ + p)2(cid:1) − q(x)(cid:0)w′ + p(cid:1) ≤ f ′

s(x, 0) − λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) + µ.

Moreover, one has εw(x/ε) → 0 as ε → 0 locally in x ∈ (R,∞).
The deﬁnition of Z∗ yields that there exist a sequence of positive numbers (εn)n and a
sequence (sn, yn)n in Br such that εn → 0, sn → t0, yn → x0 and Zεn(sn, yn) → Z∗(t0, x0) as
n → +∞. For all n, let (tn, xn) ∈ Br such that the function

(36)

Zεn − φ − εnw(·/εn) reaches a minimum at (tn, xn) over Br.

(37)

As the sequence (tn, xn)n lies in Br one can assume, up to extraction, that it converges in
Br. Let (T0, X0) its limit. For all n and for all (t, x) ∈ Br, one has

Zεn(t, x) − φ(t, x) − εnw(x/εn) ≥ Zεn(tn, xn) − φ(tn, xn) − εnw(xn/εn).

(38)

Taking t = sn, x = yn and letting n → +∞, the deﬁnition of Z∗ yields that,

Z∗(t0, x0) − φ(t0, x0) ≥ Z∗(T0, X0) − φ(T0, X0) for all (t, x) ∈ Br.

Hence, as Z∗ − φ reaches a strict local minimum at (t0, x0) over the ball Br, one gets
(T0, X0) = (t0, x0). We have thus proved that

Zεn(tn, xn) → Z∗(t0, x0),
(tn, xn) → (t0, x0) as n → +∞,
Zεn − φ − εnw(·/εn) reaches a local minimum at (tn, xn).

(39)

As x0 > 0, one has xn/εn → +∞. Take n large enough such that xn/εn > R. As

Zεn −(cid:0)φ + εnw( ·

εn

)(cid:1) reaches a local minimum in (tn, xn), we get:

∂tφ − ∂tZεn − εna(xn/εn)(∂xxφ + ε−1
−a(xn/εn)(∂xφ + ∂xw − ∂xZεn)2 − q(xn/εn)(∂xφ + ∂xw − ∂xZεn) ≥ 0,

n ∂xxw − ∂xxZεn)

(40)

20

where the derivatives of φ and Zεn are evaluated at (tn, xn) and the derivatives of w are
evaluated at xn/εn. Using the equation (33) satisﬁed by Zε, we get

∂tφ − a(xn/εn)(εn∂xxφ + ∂xxw) − a(xn/εn)(∂xφ + ∂xw)2 − q(xn/εn)(∂xφ + ∂xw)
≥ 1

f (xn/εn, vεn).

vεn

(41)

As Zεn(tn, xn) → Z∗(t0, x0) < 0, one has
vεn(tn, xn) = exp[ε−1

n Zεn(tn, xn)] → 0 as n → +∞

and thus the right-hand side of equation (41) is equivalent to f ′
(36), we deduce

s(xn/εn, 0) as n → +∞. Using

∂tφ − λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) ≥ −µ + εna(xn/εn)∂xxφ + q(xn/εn)(∂xφ − p)

−kak∞(∂xφ − p)2 − 2kak∞|∂xφ − p||∂xw + p| + o(1),

where the derivatives of φ are evaluated at (tn, xn). We remind to the reader that
p = ∂xφ(t0, x0). Hence, letting n → +∞ and µ → 0, this leads to

Finally, letting R → +∞ , one has

∂tφ(t0, x0) − λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) ≥ 0.

max{∂tZ∗ − H(∂xZ∗), Z∗} ≥ 0 in (0,∞) × (0,∞)

in the sense of viscosity solutions.

(42)

(cid:3)

4.4 A lower bound on Z∗
We now derive from equation (34) an estimate on Z∗.
Lemma 4.4 One has Z∗(t, x) ≥ min{−tH ⋆(−x/t), 0} for all (t, x) ∈ (0,∞)× (0,∞), where
H ⋆ is the convex conjugate of H.

We remind to the reader that the convex conjugate of function H is deﬁned by

H ⋆(q) = supp∈R(cid:0)pq − H(p)(cid:1).

Proof. Deﬁne U(t, x) := −t−1Z∗(t,−tx) for all t, x > 0. Take t, x > 0 such that
Z∗(t,−tx) < 0, then we get from Proposition 4.3:

∂tU(t, x) =

On the other hand, the deﬁnition (29) of Z∗ yields Z∗(αt, αx) = αZ∗(t, x) for all
(t, x) ∈ (0,∞) × (0,∞) and α > 0. Hence, U(t, x) = −Z∗(1,−x) and in particular,
∂tU(t, x) = 0 in the sense of viscosity solutions for all (t, x) such that Z∗(t,−tx) < 0. It
follows from (44) that U(t, x) ≤ H ⋆(x). Hence, if Z∗(t, x) < 0, then:
If Z∗(t, x) ≥ 0, then Z∗(t, x) ≥ min{−tH ⋆(cid:0) − x/t(cid:1), 0} is also satisﬁed.

Z∗(t, x) = −tU(t,−x/t) ≥ −tH ⋆(−x/t) ≥ min{−tH ⋆(cid:0) − x/t(cid:1), 0}.

(cid:3)

4.5 Conclusion of the proof

Proof of Part 2. of Theorem 2.1. Consider w ∈ (0, w). Then one has H(−p) > (1+ε)pw
for all p > 0 and for some ε > 0. As H(0) > 0 and H is continuous from Proposition 2.3,
there exists δ > 0 such that H(−p) > pw + δ for all p > 0, which means that −H ⋆(−w) > 0.
Lemma 4.4 and the continuity of H ⋆ yield that for all x > 0 close to w and t > 0 close to 1,
one has

Z∗(t, x) ≥ min{−tH ⋆(−x/t), 0} = 0.

Hence, (1, w) ∈ int{Z∗ = 0}. It follows from Lemma 4.2 that
u(1/ε, x/ε) = lim inf
t→+∞

vε(1, w) = lim inf

ε→0

ε→0

u(t, wt) > 0.

As limt→+∞ u(t, x) = 1 locally in x,
it follows from Theorems 1.3 and 1.6 of [3] that
limt→+∞ sup0≤x≤w′t |u(t, x) − 1| = 0 for all w′ ∈ (0, w). This concludes the proof since w
is arbitrarily close to w.

5 Application: random stationary ergodic coeﬃcients

introduced in
We will need in this Section another notion of principal eigenvalue,
[7, 9].
Consider for the moment any (deterministic) second order elliptic operator
 Lφ = a(x)φ′′ + q(x)φ′ + c(x)φ, where a, q and c are continuous and uniformly bounded
functions over R and inf R a > 0. For all non-empty open interval I ⊂ R, let
 Lφ ≤ λφ in I}. (45)
Λ1( L, I) := inf{λ,
This deﬁnition seems close to Deﬁnition 2.1 except that we do not impose any condition
on the limit of 1
x ln φ(x) as x → +∞ and that we require φ = 0 on the boundary of I,
which indeed makes a big diﬀerence. It is known [9] that if I is bounded, then Λ1( L, I) is
the Dirichlet principal eigenvalue associated with  L. The properties of Λ1( L, I) when I is
unbounded have been investigated in [7, 10, 11], where it was proved in particular that

∃φ ∈ C2(I)∩C0(I), φ > 0 in I, φ = 0 in ∂I,

Λ1( L, R) = lim

Let now turn back to random stationary ergodic coeﬃcients and consider the operators
Lω
p as in the statement of Theorem 2.2 for all ω ∈ Ø and p ∈ R. Theorem 2.2 will be derived
from the following new result, combined with Proposition 2.2 and Lemma 5.1.

Theorem 5.1 There exists a measurable set Ø1, with P(Ø1) = 1, such that for all p ∈ R
and ø ∈ Ø1:

1. one has λ1(Lω

p , R) = λ1(Lω

p , R) > Λ1( Lω, R), then there exists φ ∈ A−∞ such that Lω

Note that part 2. of the result is only true for λ1(Lω

might hold for some p near 0.

p , R) > Λ1( Lω, R). We will prove in
p , R) ≥ Λ1( Lω, R) for all p ∈ R and ω ∈ Ø, but the equality
The existence of classical eigenfunctions (called “exact correctors” in the homogenization
literature) is an open problem in the general framework of nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equa-
tion (see [21]). Davini and Siconolﬁ [13] have proved the existence of exact correctors for ﬁrst
order random stationary ergodic Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The framework of Theorem 5.1
is diﬀerent since we consider here a second order linear equation, which is a particular second
order Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Hence our result gives a second class of equations which
admit exact correctors. Note that Davini and Siconolﬁ prove the existence of exact correctors
as soon as a quantity which plays the role of an eigenvalue is above a given critical treshold,
which corresponds to our constraint λ1(Lω

p , R) > Λ1( Lω, R).

Proof of Theorem 5.1. 1. It has been proved by Nolen [23] when a ≡ 1 and extended
by Zlatos [30] to general a’s that there exists a measurable set Ø1, with P(Ø1) = 1, and
a real number γ > 0 such that for all ω ∈ Ø1 and γ > γ, there exists a unique positive
u = u(·, ω; γ) ∈ C2(R) which solves

+ f ′

s(x, ω, 0)u = γu in R,

u(0, ω; γ) = 1,

lim

x→+∞

u(x, ω; γ) = 0,

(48)

(cid:0)a(x, ω)u′(cid:1)′

while no solution of this equation exists if γ < γ. Moreover, for all γ > γ and ω ∈ Ø1, the
limit

µ(γ) := lim

x→±∞

−1
x

ln u(x, ω; γ)

exists and is positive.

The function µ does not depend on ω ∈ Ø1, it is increasing, concave and converges to
+∞ as γ tends to +∞. Moreover, the quantity γ does not depend on ω too and one has
γ = Λ1( Lω, R) for almost every ø. This implies in particular that Λ1( Lω, R) is a deterministic
quantity.

2. As µ is increasing and nonnegative, the limit ρR := limγ→γ+ µ(γ) ≥ 0 exists. The

function µ admits an inverse k : (ρR,∞) →(cid:0)γ,∞(cid:1). For all p > ρR, take γ = k(p), consider

the solution u of (48) and let φ(x) := u(x)epx for all x ∈ R. This function satisﬁes

−pφ = epx Lω(e−pxφ) = epx Lωu = γepxu = k(p)φ over R.

Moreover, one has φ > 0 in R and it follows from the Harnack inequality and elliptic

regularity that φ′/φ ∈ L∞(R). We know that

1
x

ln φ(x) =

1

ln u(x) + p → −µ(γ) + p = 0 as x → ±∞.

Hence, φ ∈ A−∞ almost surely and it follows from Proposition 2.2 that

∀ω ∈ Ø1,

∀p > ρR,

λ1(Lω

−p, R) = λ1(Lω

−p, R) = k(p).

(49)

Moreover, as ρR = limγ→γ+ µ(γ) and as p 7→ λ1(Lω
for all ω ∈ Ø, one has

−p, R) and p 7→ λ1(Lω

−p, R) are continuous

∀ω ∈ Ø1,

λ1(Lω

−ρR, R) = λ1(Lω

−ρR, R) = γ = Λ1( Lω, R).

Similarly, one can prove the existence of ρL ≤ 0 such that, up to some neglectable
modiﬁcation of Ø1, for all p < ρL and ω ∈ Ø1, there exists a solution φ ∈ A−∞ and
m(p) > Λ1( Lω, R) of Lω

−pφ = m(p)φ. It follows that

∀ω ∈ Ø1,∀p < ρL, λ1(Lω

−p, R) = λ1(Lω

−p, R) = m(p) and λ1(Lω

−ρL, R) = λ1(Lω

−ρL, R) = Λ1( Lω, R).

(50)
Lastly, the same arguments as in the proof of Proposition 5.1.v of [11] yield that

p 7→ λ1(Lω

p , R) is convex. It follows that

∀p ∈ [ρL, ρR],
−p, R) > Λ1( Lω, R) implies p < ρL or p > ρR and the conclusion follows.

−p, R) ≤ Λ1( Lω, R).

−p, R) ≤ λ1(Lω

In other words, the eigenelements are random stationary ergodic in (y, ω).

2. Next, consider for all ω ∈ Ø the elliptic equation:

s(x, ω, 0)(cid:1)u − u2 over R.

It is easy to check that for all (y, ω) ∈ R × Ø, the function

follows from (53) that R(y + z, ω) = R(y, τzω) for all (y, z, ω) ∈ R × R × Ø.

s(x, ω, 0)(cid:1) is a supersolution of this equation.
Obviously, u := supx∈R(cid:0)p2a(x, ω) + pa′(x, ω) + f ′
On the other hand, for all (y, ω) ∈ R × Ø, as limR→+∞ Λ1(cid:0) Lω, BR(y)(cid:1) = γ for all y ∈ R
and γ > 0, there exists R(y, ω) > 0 such that Λ1(cid:0) Lω, BR(y,ω)(y)(cid:1) = γ/2. Moreover, as
R 7→ Λ1(cid:0) Lω, BR(y)(cid:1) is increasing (see [7] for example), R(y, ω) is uniquely deﬁned and it
u(x) = u(x, y, ω) :=
is a subsolution of equation (54). Moreover, one has u(x) ≤ Λ1(cid:0)Lω, BR(y,ω)(y)(cid:1) ≤ γ ≤ u. The

last inequality is obtained just by taking φ(x) = epx as a test-function in the deﬁnition (45)
of γ = Λ1( Lω, R). Hence, there exists a minimal solution u = u(x, ω) of equation (54) in the
class of all the solutions satisfying u(x, 0, ω) ≤ u(x, ω) ≤ u for all (x, ω) ∈ R × Ø.
Take y ∈ R and let v(x, ω) := u(x + y, τ−yω) for all (x, ω) ∈ R × Ø. The stationarity
of the coeﬃcients yields that v is a solution of (54). Moreover, it follows from (53) that v
satisﬁes

(x, y, ω) ∈ R × R × Ø. It immediatly follows that
for all

u(x, τyω) = u(x + y, ω)

(55)

(x, y, ω) ∈ R × R × Ø.

3. The Harnack inequality and elliptic regularity imply that x 7→ (cid:0)u′/u(cid:1)(x, ω) is a
bounded function over R for all ω ∈ Ø. As, (cid:0)u′/u(cid:1)(x + y, ω) = (cid:0)u′/u(cid:1)(x, τyω) for all

(x, y, ω) ∈ R× R× Ø, the Birkhoﬀ ergodic theorem yields that there exists a measurable set
Ø2 ⊂ Ø such that P(Ø2) = 1 and for all ω ∈ Ø2:

x 7→

Moreover, the limits at +∞ and −∞ are equal and do not depend on ω ∈ Ø2. But as

u(x, ω) ≤ u for all (x, ω), these limits are necessarily zero: lim|x|→+∞
ω ∈ Ø2. Hence, u(·, ω) ∈ A−∞ for all ω ∈ Ø2. As Lω

Proof of Theorem 2.2. Let Ø0 := Ø1 ∩ Ø2 and deﬁne ρR ≥ 0 ≥ ρL, k(p) and m(p) as in

−p, R) ≤ Λ1( Lω, R) if p ∈ [ρL, ρR].

λ1(Lω

−p, R) = λ1(Lω

−p, R) = Λ1( Lω, R) if p ∈ [ρL, ρR] for all ω ∈ Ø0.

6 Application: almost periodic coeﬃcients

We prove in this section Theorems 2.3 and 2.4 and Proposition 2.6.

Proof of Theorem 2.4. The proof relies on a result from Lions and Souganidis [20],
who proved the existence of approximate correctors in the framework of homogenization of
Hamilton-Jacobi equations with almost periodic coeﬃcients. Hence, this proof illustrates the
strong link between the notion of generalized principal eigenvalues used in the present paper
and the notion of approximate correctors, which is used by the homogenization community.
We will discuss precisely this link, and more generally we will clarify how one can use
homogenization techniques to obtain spreading properties, in a forthcoming paper [8].

Consider the sequence of equations

a(x)u′′

ε + a(x)(u′

ε)2 + q(x)u′

ε + f ′

s(x, 0) = εuε in R.

(56)

s(·, 0) is uniformly bounded, the constants Mε = kf ′

As f ′
s(·, 0)kL∞(R)/ε and −Mε are respec-
tively super and subsolutions of (56). It follows from the Perron’s method that there exists
a unique solution uε ∈ C2(R) of equation (56) such that −Mε ≤ uε ≤ Mε. In particular, the
family (εuε)ε>0 is uniformly bounded over R.
For all ε > 0, as uε is bounded, it follows from (56) and classical elliptic regularity
ε reaches a local extremum at x0 ∈ R. Then

ε is bounded. Assume that u′

estimates that u′
(56) gives

from which we easily derive a bound on u′
between the cases where u′
it is not, we conclude that the family (u′
follows from (56) that (u′′

ε(x0) which does not depend on ε. Distinguishing
ε reaches its maximum, where it is monotonic at inﬁnity and where
ε)ε>0 is uniformly bounded over R. It immediatly

ε)ε>0 is also uniformly bounded over R.

Next, it has been proved by Lions and Souganidis (see Lemma 3.3 in [20]) that, as the
coeﬃcients are almost periodic, (εuε)ε>0 converges uniformly in x ∈ R as ε tends to 0. Let
λ its limit. Take δ > 0 and ε > 0 small enough such that εuε(x) ≥ λ − δ for all x ∈ R.
Deﬁne φ := euε. One has φ ∈ W 1,∞(R) ∩ C2(R), inf R φ > 0 and φ′/φ = u′
ε ∈ L∞(R). Hence,
φ ∈ A−∞. Moreover, φ satisﬁes

 Lφ = εuεφ ≥ (λ − δ)φ in R.

Hence, one has λ1( L, R) ≥ λ − δ for all δ > 0 and thus λ1( L, R) ≥ λ. Similarly, one can
prove that λ1( L, R× R) ≤ λ. As λ1( L, R × R) ≥ λ1( L, R × RN ), this gives the conclusion. (cid:3)
Proof of Theorem 2.3. Theorem 2.4 and (24) give λ1(Lp, R) = λ1(Lp, R) for all
Thus, using similar arguments as for homogeneous coeﬃcients, one gets
p ∈ R.
H(p) = H(p) = λ1(Lp, R). This concludes the proof.
(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 2.6. As L∗
2.4 gives λ1(L∗

p, R) = λ1(L∗

p, R). This implies for all R > 0:

p is associated with almost periodic coeﬃcients, Theorem

If only q and f ′

s(·, 0) were almost periodic at inﬁnity, that is, if a ≡ a∗, then Proposition

3.3 and the convergence (19) would imply

λ1(L∗

p, R) = λ1(cid:0)L∗
λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) − λ1(cid:0)L∗

p, (R,∞)).

p, (R,∞)(cid:1) = λ1(L∗
p, (R,∞)(cid:1) → 0 as R → +∞
λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) = λ1(L∗

R→+∞

and a similar convergence for λ1. We would then be able to conclude that

lim

R→+∞

λ1(Lp, (R,∞)) = lim

p, R).

(57)

If a 6≡ a∗, then one cannot apply Proposition 3.3 and an additional argument is needed.
As q∗ and c∗ are arbitrary, we assume that p = 0 with no loss of generality in order to
simplify the notations. As in the proof of Proposition 2.4, deﬁne (uε)ε>0 by

a∗(x)u′′

ε + a∗(x)(u′

ε)2 + q∗(x)u′

ε + c∗(x) = εuε in R.

(58)

27

We know that there exists a constant C > 1 such that

ku′′

εk∞ + ku′

εk∞ + kεuεk∞ ≤ C for all ε > 0,

and the proof of Proposition 2.4 yields that (εuε(x))ε>0 converges to a limit λ as ε → 0
uniformly with respect to x ∈ R, where λ = λ1( L∗, R). Take δ > 0 and ε > 0 small enough
so that |εuε(x) − λ| ≤ δ for all x ∈ R and R large enough so that

sup

x>R(cid:0)|a∗(x) − a(x)| + |q∗(x) − q(x)| + |c∗(x) − f ′

s(x, 0)|(cid:1) ≤

δ

C(1 + C)

.

Deﬁne φε := euε. One has φ′

ε = u′

εφε and φ′′

ε = u′′

εφε + (u′

ε)2φε. Hence, this function satisﬁes

a∗(x)φ′′

ε + q∗(x)φ′

ε + c∗(x)φε = εuεφε

in R.

For all x > R, we thus compute

a(x)φ′′

ε + q(x)φ′

ε + f ′

s(x, 0)φε

≥ a∗(x)φ′′

ε + q∗(x)φ′

ε + c∗(x)φε

≥ (λ − 2δ)φε(x).

ε(x) + supx>R |c∗(x) − f ′

ε(x) + supx>R |q∗(x) − q(x)|φ′

s(x, 0)|φε(x)(cid:1)
−(cid:0) supx>R |a∗(x) − a(x)|φ′′
≥ εuε(x)φε(x) − C(1 + C) supx>R(cid:0)|a∗(x) − a(x)| + |q∗(x) − q(x)| + |c∗(x) − f ′
s(x, 0)|(cid:1)φε(x)
Hence, using φε as a test-function in the deﬁnition of λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1), we conclude that
for any δ > 0, there exists some R such that λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1) ≥ λ − 2δ. Hence,
limR→+∞ λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1) ≥ λ. Similarly, one can prove that limR→+∞ λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1) ≤ λ.

Hence,

lim

R→+∞

λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1) = lim

R→+∞

λ1(cid:0) L, (R,∞)(cid:1) = λ.

Moreover, we know from the proof of Proposition 2.4 that λ = λ1( L∗, R) = λ1( L∗, R). As q∗
and c∗ are abritrary almost periodic functions, we derive from (24):

lim

R→+∞

λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) = lim

R→+∞

λ1(cid:0)Lp, (R,∞)(cid:1) = λ1(L∗

p, R) = λ1(L∗

p, R)

that is, H(p) = H(p) = λ1(L∗

p, R) for all p ∈ R. The conclusion immediatly follows.
