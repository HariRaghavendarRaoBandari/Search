Various statistical tests have been developed for testing the equality of means in matched
pairs with missing values. However, most existing methods are commonly based on certain
distributional assumptions such as normality, 0-symmetry or homoscedasticity of the data.
The aim of this paper is to develop a statistical test that is robust against deviations from
such assumptions and also leads to valid inference in case of heteroscedasticity or skewed
distributions. This is achieved by applying a novel randomization approach. The resulting
test procedure is not only shown to be asymptotically correct but is also ﬁnitely exact if the
distribution of the data is invariant with respect to the considered randomization group. Its
small sample performance is further studied in an extensive simulation study and compared
to existing methods. Finally, an illustrative data example is analyzed.

Keywords: Missing Values; Permutation Tests; Randomization Tests; Student’s t-test; Welch
test.

1 Motivation and introduction

Matched pairs designs are concerned with scientiﬁc experiments in which subjects are observed
repeatedly under two different treatments or time points. Testing equality of means of such
data, where some of the components are randomly missing is a problem usually encountered
in practice. In previous years, several statistical methods have been proposed for dealing with
this issue. Here, the most simplest suggestion is to only work with the completely observed
pairs and to carry out the well-known paired t-test. The main problem of this approach is that it
discards all information from the incomplete observations. This will typically lead to a power
loss. Moreover, the test can only be applied when the data are assumed to be missing completely
at random; see the monograph of Little and Rubin [2014] for an introduction and discussion on
the different missingness mechanisms. One possibility to overcome this problem might be to
apply multiple-imputation techniques, see e.g. Verbeke and Molenberghs [2009]. However
these techniques often require large sample sizes for being correct, see e.g. the discussion in
Akritas et al. [2002]. Other possibilities that use all observed information in the matched pairs
design (but not more) include the statistical tests proposed in Lin and Stivers [1974], Ekbohm
[1976], Bhoj [1978], Looney and Jones [2003], Kim et al. [2005], and Samawi and Vogel
[2014]. All of these tests, however, rely on speciﬁc model assumptions such as symmetry or
even bivariate normality. Especially the latter is typically not met in practice but crucial for
relatively small sample sizes. If these speciﬁc assumptions are not met the corresponding tests
might possess possibly inﬂated type-I error control.

Therefore, the aim of the present paper is to provide a statistical test for partially paired
data which does not require any parametric assumptions, possesses nice small and large sam-
ple properties and (only) uses all observed information. This is achieved by applying a novel
studentized randomization approach to a weighted test statistic involving both, the paired t-test
as well as the Welch test statistic. The resulting randomization test combines recent ﬁndings
on studentized permutation tests for complete observations in unpaired and paired designs, see
Janssen [1997], Janssen [1999a], Janssen [1999b], Neubert and Brunner [2007], Pauly [2011],
Konietschke and Pauly [2012], Omelka and Pauly [2012], Chung and Romano [2013], DiCiccio
and Romano [2015], Pauly et al. [2015] and Chung and Romano [2016]. The application of the
studentized randomization approach to incomplete data is original to the present paper.

To formulate the concrete testing problem, let us consider a general matched pairs design

given by i.i.d random vectors

,

Xj =

(1.1)
with mean vector E(X1) = µ = (µ1, µ2)(cid:48) ∈ R2 and an arbitrary covariance matrix Cov(X1) =
Σ > 0. Within Model (1.1) we now like to test the null hypothesis H0 : {µ1 = µ2}. Here, some
of the random vectors components might be missing completely at random as described in the
next section.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the statistical model for in-
complete paired data and a weighted test statistic. A permutation test based on this statistic
is introduced in Section 3, where also its theoretical properties are explained. We review the
existing methods for incomplete paired data in Section 4 to choose adequate competitors to in-
vestigate together with our novel procedure in extensive simulations given in Section 5. Finally,
a real data example is considered in Section 6. All proofs are shifted to the Appendix.

2 Statistical model, hypotheses and statistics

When some of the components of the matched pairs are missing completely at random, we may
sort the data into complete and incomplete observed random vectors and rewrite Model (1.1)
with independent random variables as

Moreover, the complete pairs (X (c)
unstructured covariance matrix Σ > 0. Thus, the observations are missing completely at ran-
dom. At the end of Section 3 we comment on how to relax these model assumptions to the case
where the incomplete observations are only assumed to be independent.

In the setting (2.1), we like to use all the available data to test the null hypotheses H0 :
{µ1 = µ2} against the one-sided alternative {µ1 > µ2} or the two-sided alternative {µ1 (cid:54)= µ2}.
For ease of convenience, we below focus on the one-sided case and note that two-sided tests
can be obtained similarly by, for example, taking absolute values.
To motivate our test statistic, we ﬁrst consider the most extreme situations. In a completely
observed case with n1 = n, the matched pairs would typically be inferred with the usual paired
t-test type statistic

where a ∈ [0, 1] can be used to weight the inference drawn from the complete pairs. We
suggest to use a = 2n1/(n + n1) or a = n1/n to cover the usually applied methods in the two
extreme cases n1 = n and n1 = 0. The asymptotic null distribution of T as min(n1, n2, n3) →
∞ is stated below. The asymptotic framework is, e.g., reasonable when assuming that each
component is missing at random with a certain probability p ∈ (0, 1).
THEOREM 2.1 Suppose that n2/(n2 + n3) → κ ∈ (0, 1) as min(n1, n2, n3) → ∞ then we have
under H0 : µ1 = µ2

|P (T ≤ x) − Φ(x)| → 0,

sup
x∈R

(2.5)

where Φ denotes the cdf of N (0, 1).

From this a consistent asymptotic level α test is given by ϕ = 1{T > z1−α} for testing
the one-sided case {µ1 ≤ µ2} vs {µ1 > µ2} and similar in the two-sided case, see also Samawi
and Vogel [2014]. Here z1−α denotes the (1 − α)-quantile of the standard normal distribution,
α ∈ (0, 1). However, large sample sizes of the incomplete paired data are necessary to get
an accurate approximation of this test statistic.
In particular, if the sample size is small or
the underlying distribution shows deviation from symmetry, the test will in general not keep the
preassigned type-I error level accurately, see the simulation study in Section 5 below. Therefore,
we suggest a novel permutation approach in the next section that is not only asymptotically valid
but also ﬁnitely exact under certain assumptions.

3 The permutation procedures

Previous to our work, permutation techniques have been applied to the incomplete pairs design
by Maritz [1995] and Yu et al. [2012]. However, these methods have the drawback that certain
distributional assumptions such as 0-symmetry and equal variances or sample sizes are needed

4

to obtain a (at least asymptotically) valid level α test.

To overcome this issue, we propose a different permutation test that has the ﬁnite sam-
ple exactness property under similar invariance assumptions but is also (asymptotically) robust
against deviations such as heteroscedasticity or underlying skewed distributions, i.e. valid for
our general model (2.1). The procedure is based on separate results about studentized permu-
tation tests for the paired and unpaired case. For example, in the classical matched pairs case
with n1 = n Janssen [1999b] and Konietschke and Pauly [2014] have already recommended
(based on theoretical results and extensive simulation studies) a studentized permutation test in
the paired t-test, where the components of each pair are randomly permuted. In comparison, in
the general Behrens-Fisher set-up with n2 + n3 = n, Janssen [1997]; Janssen and Pauls [2003]
as well as Janssen [2005] proposed a studentized permutation test in the Welch-type statistic T2
that is based on randomly permuting the pooled sample, see also Chung and Romano [2013]
as well as Pauly et al. [2015] for recent generalizations of this approach to multiple samples
and general factorial designs. These studentized permutation procedures have also been imple-
mented in R and SAS, see Placzek et al. [2014] as well as the R package GFD.

Jointly applying the ideas of both approaches we propose a permutation test that is based
on the weighted test statistic T as follows: First, we randomly permute the components of each
complete observation resulting in

where τi, i = 1, . . . , n1, are uniformly distributed on the symmetric group S2 (i.e. are ran-
dom permutations of (1, 2)) and independent of X = (X (c), X (i)). Second, for the incom-
plete observations, we randomly permute the pooled incomplete sample (Z1, . . . , Zn2+n3) =
(X (i)
2n3) by means of a random permutation π that is uniformly dis-
tributed on Sn2+n3 and independent of all other variables resulting in

Finally, we approximate the null distribution of T by the conditional distribution of the permu-
1 − aT2(X (i)
π ). The
tation version of the test statistic Tp = T (X (c)
validity of this approach is proven below, where ’ p−→’ denotes convergence in probability.
THEOREM 3.1 Suppose that n2/(n2 + n3) → κ ∈ (0, 1) as min(n1, n2, n3) → ∞ then we have
(3.2)
Moreover, choosing cp(α) as (1 − α)-quantile of the permutation distribution of Tp given the
data, the test ϕp = 1{T > cp(α)} + γp1{T = cp(α)} is consistent and of asymptotic level α
for testing H0 against one-sided alternatives {µ1 > µ2}. Moreover, in the special case that D1
is 0-symmetric and X (i)

|P (Tp ≤ x|X) − Φ(x)|

11 has the same distribution as X (i)

By inverting the above one-sided test, we can also construct one–sided conﬁdence interval

REMARK 3.1 [Relaxing the Model Assumptions] If the data is only missing at random, the
i.i.d. assumptions of the incompletely observed ﬁrst and second components, respectively, in
model (2.1) might be violated. However, the above permutation approach can still be valid
in such a situation. To accept this consider the relaxed model, where the incomplete com-
ponents (X (i)
1k )k and (X (i)
2(cid:96) )(cid:96) are independent of X (c) and assumed to be (row-wise) indepen-
dent and inﬁnitesimal with mean µ1 (ﬁrst component) and µ2 (second component), respec-

positive asymptotic variance it then follows from results of Janssen and Pauls [2003] and
Janssen [2005] that the convergences (3.2) and T d→ N (0, 1) still hold under the null hy-
pothesis. Thus, the proposed randomization procedure remains an asymptotic exact level α
test. Moreover, skipping the assumption of mean equality, i.e. E(X (i)
s1 ) may
hold for s = 1, 2, r = 1, . . . , ns+1, the procedure is even valid for testing the null hypothe-

4 Alternative approaches

In this subsection, we brieﬂy review the existing literature to select possible competitors for
our subsequent simulation study. Several methods that (only) deal with all available data in the
incomplete matched pairs design have been suggested. However, most of the available proce-
dures are based on speciﬁc assumptions such as normality, 0-symmetry or homoscedasticity of
the data. We can summarize the most commonly used methods as follows:

(a) Tests based on modiﬁed maximum likelihood estimators (cf., e.g., Lin and Stivers [1974],

Ekbohm [1976, 1981], Woolson et al. [1976], or Hamdan et al. [1978]).

(b) Tests based on simple mean difference estimator (see, e.g., Lin and Stivers [1974], Ekbohm

[1976], Bhoj [1989], Looney and Jones [2003], or Uddin and Hasan [2015]).

6

(c) Weighted linear and nonlinear combination tests (cf., e.g., Bhoj [1978, 1984, 1991], Kim

et al. [2005], or Samawi and Vogel [2014]).

(d) Resampling and more speciﬁc randomization methods (see, e.g., Maritz [1995] and Yu et al.

[2012]).

For ease of presentation, it is not possible to compare our suggested approach with all these
procedures. Also, none of them is free from distributional assumptions and at the same time
robust against deviations such as heteroscedasticity and skewed distributions. Therefore, we
selected a few procedures for the comparisons in our simulation study below. First, the test
statistic proposed by Lin and Stivers [1974] has been chosen. It is a studentized mean difference
statistic given by

normality of the data, and thus proposed to approximate the distribution of TLS by a tn−4-
distribution with n − 4 degrees of freedom. In extensive simulation studies (e.g. Dunu [1994],
and Bhoj [1989, 1991]), it turned out that the TLS maintained the type-I error rate quite ac-
curately under homoscedasticity. Moreover, it was found to possess a much better power be-
haviour in case of data with low correlation than the following competitors: The paired t-test
only depending on the complete observations, the independent two-sample t-test only depend-
ing on the incomplete cases, the test by [Hamdan et al., 1978] based on a modiﬁed maximum
likelihood estimator and the weighted convex combination test given in [Bhoj, 1991].

et al. [2012].

(n1, n2, n3) ∈ (10, 10, 10) (left) and (30, 10, 10) (right) and different covariance matrices Σ1 (a)
and Σ2 (b).

Finally, we selected the asymptotic test T of Section 2 as it was recommended by a simula-
tion study in Samawi and Vogel [2014] in favor of their suggested pooled t-test and the corrected
z-test [Looney and Jones, 2003]. A similar conclusion was drawn by Guo and Yuan [2015] who
also found out in an extensive simulation study that T controls the type-I error rate quite accu-
rate in case of moderate sample sizes.

Other tests as the corrected z-test by Looney and Jones [2003] or the pooled t-test by Samawi
and Vogel [2014] have not been included since they also showed worse performances for small
sample sizes in other simulation studies, see e.g. Samawi and Vogel [2014], Guo and Yuan
[2015] and Uddin and Hasan [2015]. We thus restricted our simulation study to comparing the
small sample behavior of our suggested test with the three competitors from above.

5 Monte-Carlo simulations

In this Section, we investigate the ﬁnite sample behavior of our suggested permutation test
and the chosen competing procedures as described in Section 4 in extensive simulations. As
major assessment criteria all procedures were studied with respect to (i) maintaining the preas-
signed type-I error level under the null hypothesis and (ii) their powers to detect certain alter-
natives. The observations were generated using four symmetric and skewed bivariate distribu-

Here, the standardized random errors εij, i = 1, 2, were generated by εij = Yij−E(Yi1)

Similarly, the incomplete observations were generated as X (i)
2j = σi ˜εij + µi, where ˜εij are in-
dependent copies of the εij and the scaling factors are σ1 = 1 and σ2 ∈ {1,
2} depend-
ing on the choice of covariance matrix. Moreover, the following sample sizes (n1, n2, n3) ∈
{(10, 10, 10), (30, 10, 10)} were considered and the nominal signiﬁcance level was taken as
α = 0.05. Under the null hypothesis, we set µ1 = µ2 = 0. To also evaluate the empirical
power, the second samples were shifted by adding a shift µ2 = δ ∈ {0, 0.5, 1}. The choice
of δ = 0 corresponds to the analysis of the empirical level of signiﬁcance. All simulations
were operated by means of the R computing environment, version 3.2.2 [R Core Team, 2015]
and each setting was based on 10, 000 simulation runs and B = 1, 000 permutations runs. The
algorithm for the computation of the p-value of our suggested permutation test is as follows:

ing procedures also failed to control the type-I error rate for the underlying sample sizes. More
speciﬁc, in the case of homoscedasticity, data with low correlation (|ρ| ≤ 0.5), and exponential
distribution our suggested Tp still results in an accurate test decision and also performs better
when the number of complete pairs is increased.

In contrast, the competing tests do not control the type-I error level constantly under het-
eroscedasticity or even under homoscedasticity in the two considered cases of sample sizes. It
can also be seen from Figure 1 that the weighted test T is rather liberal in the case of small
number of complete pairs and less liberal for larger number of complete pairs. This behavior of
the test does not depend on the homoscedasticity assumption. Moreover, the test that is based
on the simple mean difference estimator TLS controls type-I rate in the case of equal variances
under all the simulation settings except for the skewed exponential distribution. However, it is
very liberal in the case of heteroscedasticity and its behavior is much worse for larger number
of complete pairs. Finally, the test t3 tends to result in a liberal decision in the case of small
number of complete pairs and vice versa it is nearly exact level α in case of a larger number of
complete pairs; especially under homoscedasticity.

Due to the rather liberal
behavior of the test based on TLS and the asymptotic test based on T , their power functions
are not really comparable to the others. Therefore, we restrict our power simulation study to
the analysis of Tp and t3. Moreover, since their type-I error rate control is rather similar for
(n1, n2, n3) ∈ (30, 10, 10) we only consider the unbalanced case. Figure 2 shows the power of
both methods for highly correlated data involving homoscedastic as well as heteroscedastic set-
tings. It can be easily seen that our suggested studentized permutation test Tp has a larger power
under all studied settings. However, both tests yielded an almost similar power behavior when
equal variances and symmetric distributions are present. In all other cases (heteroscedasticity or
asymmetric distributions) the power of t3 is considerably smaller. Note, that the power functions
are not really comparable under the exponential distribution due to their rather liberal behavior
and we have only included it for illustration and completeness. In the power simulations for all
the other considered situations (not shown here) both tests performed nearly similar.

6 Analysis of the data example

The Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS) as proposed by Karnofsky [1949], is an im-
portant assessment tool for functional impairment. This scale can be used for determining the
prognosis of individual patients or for comparing effectiveness of several therapies. The score
ranges from 0 to 100. The lower the KPS score, the lower the probability of survival.
A clinical study by Hermann and Looney [2001] has been performed to assess the functional
status of hospice patients during their last seven days of life and to discover and examine the
different interventions that have been implemented to treat the patients symptoms. Their study
consists of 100 hospice patients. KPS scores were used to assess the functional status of the
patients on the day before they died and their last day of life resulting in paired data. These pairs
were not complete. For example, there were a total of n1 = 9 complete pairs and two unpaired
samples for the patients who were only observed on their day before they died or their last day
of life of sizes n2 = 28 and n3 = 23 respectively. The data was published in Rempala and
Looney [2006]. We applied all considered testing methods Tp, T , TLS, and t3 to detect the null
hypothesis of equality of means of the KPS scores on the day before they died and on the last
day of their life (H0 : {µ1 = µ2}) against the one-sided alternative {µ1 > µ2} or the two-sided
alternative {µ1 (cid:54)= µ2}. The results are summarized in Table 1.

All four tests provided in Table 1 reject the null hypothesis and indicate that the mean values
of KPS score on the last day and on the day before they died are signiﬁcantly different (two sided
p-value < 0.05). In particular, their KPS score on the day before they died was signiﬁcantly
greater than their score on the last day of life (right-sided p-value < 0.05).

7 Conclusions and discussion

The problem of incomplete paired data occurs frequently in practice. In this work, we have
provided a novel randomization test that is not based on any parametric assumptions and uses
all the observed data of the matched pairs design. It was shown to be asymptotic valid and
even ﬁnitely exact if certain invariance properties are met. For the asymptotic considerations,
ideas of Janssen [1997], Janssen [1999a], Janssen [1999b], Neubert and Brunner [2007], Pauly
[2011], Konietschke and Pauly [2012], Omelka and Pauly [2012], Chung and Romano [2013],
DiCiccio and Romano [2015], Pauly et al. [2015] and Chung and Romano [2016] on studentized
permutation tests for paired and unpaired two-sample problems were combined. In addition, the
theoretical asymptotic ﬁndings were also applied to bioequivalence problems and to construct
one- and two-sided conﬁdence interval for the two sample mean difference.

In an extensive simulation study, the advantageous theoretical properties of the randomiza-
tion test were underpinned. There it was seen that our novel test possess nice small sample
properties and particularly improves the small sample behavior of the asymptotic test based on
the same weighted test statistic T . In particular, the simulations also indicated that our random-
ization test is robust in terms of error control against heteroscedasticity or skewed distributions
in most considered situations. Only in the case of the exponential distribution with rather large
correlations its behaviour was rather liberal for small sample sizes. In this setting, however, the
other considered competing procedures (Samawi and Vogel [2014], Kim et al. [2005], and Lin
and Stivers [1974]) also failed to control the type-I error rate.

To sum up, its simulation results together with the ﬁnite exactness property under invariance
and its asymptotic correctness make the new permutation procedure recommendable in practice.

Appendix

Proof of Theorem 2.1:
It follows from the central limit theorem and Slutzky that we have convergence in distribution

T1(X (c))

d−→ N (0, 1)

as well as T2(X (i))

d−→ N (0, 1).

Since T1(X (c)) and T2(X (i)) are independent, it follows that

√

aT1(X (c)) +

√

1 − aT2(X (i))

d−→ N (0, a + 1 − a) = N (0, 1).

The stated result thus follows from Polya’s Theorem.

2

Proof of Theorem 3.1:
From the results given in Janssen [1999b] and Konietschke and Pauly [2014] it follows under
the given assumptions that

τ ) ≤ x|X (c)) − Φ(x)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)P (T1(X (c)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)P (T2(X (i)

sup
x∈R

sup
x∈R

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) p→ 0.
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) p→ 0.

Similarly, the resuls from [Janssen, 2005], see also [Pauly et al., 2015], show that

π ) ≤ x|X (i)) − Φ(x)

(7.1)

Since π and τj, j = 1, . . . , n1, are independent the weak convergence result follows from a
conditional Slutzky Theorem, see e.g. Chung and Romano [2013] or Pauly [2009]. From this
an application of Lemma 1 in Janssen and Pauls [2003] proves the consistency and asymptotic
exactness of the permutation test. The ﬁnite exactness under the given invariance assumptions
follows from classical theory on randomization tests, see e.g. Lehmann and Romano [2006] or
Janssen and V¨olker [2007].
2

Proof of Remark 3.1:
First, T d→ N (0, 1) follows from Raikov’s Theorem. Thus, to accept the stated results we only
have to argue that (7.1) also holds for the more general model under the stated assumptions. But
this follows from Theorem 4.1 in Janssen [2005] by applying Lemma 7 in Janssen and Pauls
[2003], see also the comments in Example 5(c) of the ﬁrst paper.
