Abstract

We consider the observable eﬀects of CP-violating anomalous W W h and ZZh interactions
arising from gauge invariant dimension-6 operators at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with
the purpose of distinguishing them from not only the standard model eﬀects but also those of
CP-even anomalous interactions of similar nature. The postulation of a gauge invariant origin
makes various couplings of this kind interrelated. The updated constraints from the LHC as
well as limits from neutron and electron dipole moments are used in selecting the benchmark
interaction strengths. We use some asymmetry parameters that have no contribution from
standard or CP-even anomalous interactions. Parton showering and detector level simulation
is included to make our analysis as realistic as possible. On the whole, we conclude that
gauge invariant interaction of strength ≥ 40/TeV2 can be successfully isolated using integrated
luminosities in the 1.5-3.0 ab−1 range.

Introduction

As results from the high energy run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) start arriving, interest
in probing any non-standard behavior of the scalar with mass around 125-126 GeV [1, 2] remains
ever-alive. To keep the ﬂame on, departure from the pattern of its interactions as laid down in
the standard model (SM) is still allowed, though not imperatively, by the (7+8) TeV data. On
the other hand, issues ranging from the naturalness of the Higgs mass to the question of vacuum

stability continue to nudge theorists even after Higgs discovery. Therefore, it is both legitimate
and well-motivated to enquire if the high energy run can reveal some non-standard interactions
of the particle which, in all fairness, can be called ‘a Higgs boson’. Some such investigations in
relation to CP-violating V V h(V = W ±, Z) couplings are reported here.

A rather general approach is to consider eﬀective interactions of the Higgs, without committing
oneself to any speciﬁc theoretical model. In this spirit, many studies have been taken place over the
years, probing higher-dimensional W W h and ZZh interactions, often taking them in isolation and
predicting observable phenomena in terms of the new operators [3–56]. It is, however, worthwhile
to obtain these interactions in terms of gauge invariant higher-dimensional operators [57–62]. This
is primarily because these operators can arise, if at all, by integrating out hitherto unseen new
physics, and such physics, ruling above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale, must by default
be SU (2)L × U (1)Y invariant. Also, the W W h, ZZh, γγh and γZh interaction terms ensuing
from such gauge invariant operators are correlated, and this correlation percolates into observed
phenomena involving Higgs production as well as decay. A detailed inventory as well as a large mass
of work already exists on CP-even operators of this kind and their constraints and consequences.
Systematic studies on their CP-odd counterparts are relatively sparse, and perhaps less exhaustive.
However, the very observation of the baryon asymmetry in the universe strongly suggests some
source of CP-violation over and above what is manifested in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
scheme of the SM. A bottom-up investigation of CP-odd couplings of the recently discovered
scalar is therefore as well-founded as one on their CP-even counterparts.

In general, there are ﬁve each of CP-even and-odd operators of dimension-6 involving V V h
interactions. Coeﬃcients of the latter are subject to rather strong constraints from the limits
on the electric dipole moments (EDM) of the neutron and the electron, in addition to global
ﬁts of collider data (including those from the LHC) that constrains the CP-even operators as
well. Arguably the most detailed study of these constraints on the CP-violating operators were
presented in the reference [63]. It is, however, possible to generalize the study even further. First,
the constraints from EDM are rather tight on individual operators which tend to get very strongly
correlated if there are two or three of them present at a time. On the other hand, taking all ﬁve
of them together relaxes such correlations considerably, and one can end up with large values of
the eﬀective V V h couplings that potentially contribute to collider observables. Moreover, once
we introduce the gauge invariant eﬀective interaction terms, the simultaneous existence of several
of them is the general expectation, unless some speciﬁc symmetries are invoked to forbid some of
them. Secondly, global ﬁts of collider data can yield less stringent constraints if CP-odd and-even
operators are all present simultaneously, mainly due the sheer proliferation of parameters (which
nonetheless should be there in the general eﬀective theory). On the other hand, it is only natural to
expect operators of both kinds of a given dimensionality to exist, in the absence of any forbidding
principle.

To further elaborate on the second issue mentioned above, we need to identify some observables,
mostly deﬁned in terms of asymmetries, which subtract out the eﬀect of CP-even operators, while
keeping substantial separation between the CP-odd ones with the standard model predictions
including their uncertainties. This is accomplished in the present work, allowing in principle the
existence of all CP-odd and-even gauge invariant dimension-6 operators. The points we emphasize
in particular are as follows:

• Constraints from collider as well as EDM limits are listed in terms of the eﬀective V V h

couplings, though they can arise from all possible operators at the same time.

• The contributions of the CP-even operators to the suggested asymmetries at the LHC lie
within the 1σ error-bars of the SM, while the CP-odd ones are shown to lead to values that

2

steer clear of these error-bars over extended regions of the parameter space.

• The prediction of observable asymmetries is based on detailed event generation, including
showering, jet formation and detector simulation, thus leading to realistic estimates of what
can be observed.

• Our ‘realistic’ predictions of CP-violating asymmetries and suppression of the eﬀects of CP-
even operators are presented for various luminosities, giving an idea of the luminosity required
to obtain useful conclusions.

• Correlated interactions arising due to the gauge-invariant nature of the parent operators
are always taken into account, taking, for example, the γZh and γγh couplings arising
concomitantly from the dimension-6 operators (and thus competing favorably with their
loop-induced SM counterparts).

A resume of the CP-odd dimension-6 operators as well as their current limits is given in section
2. Some observable quantities, studied phenomenologically in earlier works, which receive contri-
butions from CP-odd as well as CP-even operators, are discussed in section 3, establishing that
they cannot be suﬃcient and conclusive to elicit presence of the CP-odd operators. The observ-
ables that perform this task successfully, and the contribution to them from CP-odd and CP-even
interactions, are discussed in section 4. We summarize and conclude in section 5.

2 CP-odd anomalous couplings and their constraints

The independent set of CP-violating gauge-Higgs operators of dimension-6 that we have considered
in our analysis [63] is listed below :

˜OW =

˜OBB =

˜OBW =

˜fW
Λ2 (DµΦ)† ˆ˜W µν(Dν Φ);

˜OB =

˜OW W =

˜fB
Λ2 (DµΦ)† ˆ˜Bµν(Dν Φ);
˜fW W
Λ2 Φ† ˆ˜W µν ˆWµνΦ;

These operators give rise to the CP-odd V V h interaction vertices of following form,

˜LV V h =

Λ2

˜CV V h [ǫµναβkα

(2)

where V = W, Z, γ. The coeﬃcients ˜CV V h denote the eﬀective coupling strengths of CP-odd V V h
couplings and, are listed in Table 1. The V V h interaction vertices arising from corresponding
CP-even operators are derived in Ref. [62].

Our aim in the present work is to include scenarios where both CP-odd and-even operators are

present, and to discriminate between them via appropriately deﬁned asymmetry parameters.

We demonstrate this by turning on the CP-even operator,

OW W =

fW W
Λ2 Φ† ˆW µν ˆWµν Φ,

which contributes to all the V V h vertices. The additional interaction terms thus playing a role

in our analysis have the following form [62]

which are similar to the corresponding CP-odd couplings receiving contributions from ˜OW W oper-
ator.

In [63] we derived limits on the parameters of the CP-odd operators using the collider data
(from LEP and LHC) and measurements of electron and neutron EDMs. These limits were obtained
taking mainly two parameters (2P) and three parameters (3P) nonzero at a time. The limits on
parameters were further used to constrain the eﬀective CP-odd VVh couplings which are listed in
Table 2.

As has been already stated, these constraints can get relaxed when we keep all ﬁve CP-violating
operators to be non-zero at the same time, and also include at least some of their CP-conserving
counterparts. Such enlargement of the allowed region of the parameter space occurs through
cancellation of contributions to EDM’s, and also via a larger number of coeﬃcients being varied
in marginalized global ﬁts of the LHC data.

In the following section we present some kinematic distributions in the context of W W h cou-
pling and compare the eﬀects of CP-violating operators with those of the SM and the CP-conserving
ones.

3 Some kinematic distributions with CP-even and CP-odd oper-

ators : W W h Coupling

In any elementary particle scattering process, the size and shape of certain kinematic distributions
involving leptons and jets can change non-trivially with respect to the purely standard model
prediction in the presence of both CP-odd and-even higher dimensional operators. Some of these
have been studied mostly in purely phenomenological formulations, i.e. without working in terms
of gauge invariant dimension-6 operators ( [8, 11, 12, 19, 28, 31, 32, 34, 38, 39]). We look for a process

where the anomalous V V h coupling enters both at the production and decay vertices, namely
the Higgs associated production with a W -boson, followed by its decay in the W W ∗ mode. We
consider only the same-sign dilepton ﬁnal state, where only one of the W ’s coming from the
Higgs decays into leptons. The kinematic distributions we focus on were explored earlier in, for
example, reference [19]. However, this was mostly at the parton level, while we include the eﬀects
of hadronisation, showering and ﬁnite detector resolution.

We consider pp → hℓν, h → W W ∗ → ℓνjj with ℓ = e, µ and j stands for light quark jets.
Events with jet pairs having large invariant mass (> 500 GeV) and with ∆ηjj > 2.8 [64] are left
out, so as to avoid contamination by the vector boson fusion mechanism. The analysis is done for
√s(pp) = 14 TeV.

Here we compare distributions in ∆pT and cosine of the angle between the same-sign dileptons
in the ﬁnal state for the SM, CP-even and CP-odd W W h couplings. One of these leptons comes
from Higgs decay while the other has its source in the decay of the associated W produced in the
hard scattering. Note that the variable ∆pT = pT (ℓ1) − pT (ℓ2), where ℓ1 and ℓ2 are the hardest
and second hardest leptons respectively. To simulate the CP-even W W h vertex, we choose the
benchmark value fW W = −3.0 [65] while for the CP-odd vertex we take ˜fB = 30.0 and ˜fW = 31.26.
Both of these benchmarks are consistent with existing constraints [63,65]. These values correspond
to CW W h = 6.0 and ˜CW W h = −31.26. Throughout our analysis we consider Mh = 126 GeV. We
implement the anomalous couplings in Madgraph [66] using the package FeynRules [67]. The cross
sections are calculated using nn23lo1 [68] parton distribution functions with default settings for
renormalization and factorization scales. While the parton level events are generated in Madgraph,
the Pythia [69] switch is turned on to incorporate showering, hadronisation and initial and ﬁ-
nal state radiation (ISR/FSR) eﬀects. The HEP ﬁle obtained from this interfacing is passed to
Delphes-3.1.2 [70] which gives a ROOT [71] ﬁle as output. We use the anti-kt algorithm in
Delphes with a cone size of 0.6 to form the jets. The ROOT ﬁle thus obtained is fed to the
analysis code to generate the distributions. The detection eﬃciency is guided by Delphes once we
impose the following criteria to select our events:

5

1. Lepton rapidity : |η| < 2.5
2. Minimum transverse momenta of the hardest and second hardest leptons : pT (ℓ1) > 40 GeV

and pT (ℓ2) > 30 GeV respectively.

3. Missing transverse energy:   ET > 30 GeV.

The SM cross section for the signal satisfying the above selection cuts is about 0.22 fb. The
above cuts suppress the background from b¯b pairs followed by b − ¯b oscillation. The t¯t background
via charm decay is also taken care of by the lepton hardness cut.

same sign dileptons) and ∆pT respectively. Fig. 1 shows the plots of the cosθ distributions in l+l+

for three cases, namely (1) SM (2) SM + CP-even V V h couplings (labeled SM+CP-even) and
(3) SM + CP-odd V V h couplings (labeled SM+CP-odd). The left (1a) and the right (1b) panels
show the ℓ+ℓ+ and ℓ−ℓ− distributions respectively. One can conclude from the distributions for
both ℓ+ℓ+ and ℓ−ℓ− that when the CP-odd operators are turned on, the back-to-back dileptons
are more favored, in contrast to the behavior with the SM and the CP-even anomalous operators.
Similar plots are presented for ∆pT in Fig. 2. One can see from the ﬁgure that, in the case with
non-vanishing CP-odd couplings, the normalized distribution in the high ∆pT region is relatively
strengthened as compared to the SM or the CP-even cases.

On the whole, some distinction of the CP-violating interaction is expected in the back-to-back
region for the leptons, which, correspond to a rather small number of events. Similarly, the tail
of the ∆pT distribution oﬀers a discrimination. However, it is not clear as to how well-separated
these distributions are, once statistical ﬂuctuation of the SM rates are taken into account. There
is always the chance of diﬀerence with CP-even anomalous interaction signatures being obliterated
through such ﬂuctuations. Keeping these in mind, we consider in the next section some observables
where, ideally, neither the SM couplings nor the CP-even anomalous interactions can contribute at
all.

4

Isolating the eﬀect of CP-odd couplings

To isolate the eﬀects of CP-violating high scale physics from the CP-conserving part of the eﬀective
Lagrangian, we need to construct observables which do not receive contributions in the presence of
CP-even operators alone. More precisely, one is looking here for asymmetries, constructed out of
such observables, which are unlikely to be faked by the SM or other CP-even operators via statistical
ﬂuctuation and/or detector eﬀects. We quantitatively establish such characteristics of the chosen
observables after a realistic simulation.

The observables we thus focus on are required to be not just CP-odd but also ˆT -odd 1. This
additional requirement stems from the fact that, if the observable is CP-odd and ˆT -even, apparent
CP-violating eﬀects can be triggered by the presence of absorptive phases in the amplitude [72],
which do not reverse signs upon charge conjugation. Since, in contrast, the eﬀective Lagrangian
parameters considered in this study are all real, we require the observables to be CP-odd and
ˆT -odd.

4.1 Signal and backgrounds
With the above considerations in view, we take up the analysis of the process, pp → ZH → ℓ+ℓ−b¯b
with ℓ = e, µ. We consider the decay of Higgs to b¯b ﬁnal state to ensure suﬃcient event rates. The
ﬁnal state is required to have two opposite sign leptons and exactly two b-tagged jets. The proton-
proton collisions are simulated at the center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. In presence of dimension-6
operators, this process also receives contribution from a tree-level diagram involving γZh vertex,
which is not present in the SM. Thus there is an interference of the two s−channel diagrams
involving the ZZh and γZh vertices at the amplitude level. This is because the same gauge-Higgs
operators that give rise to the anomalous CZZh coupling also give rise to the CγZh interaction 1.
We start with following basic cuts on the transverse momentum, rapidity and separation of
leptons (ℓ) and jets (J), where J = j, b; j being the light quark jets and b corresponds to the
b-induced jets.

1 ˆT is the naive time reversal transformation that ﬂips the sign of the particle spin and momenta, without changing

the initial or ﬁnal states.

7

1. pTJ,ℓ > 20 GeV and |ηJ,ℓ| < 2.5 : We demand that our ﬁnal state leptons and jets should lie

in the central rapidity region each with a minimum transverse momentum of 20 GeV.

2. ∆RJ J,J ℓ > 0.4 : We demand that both the jets should be well separated from each other as

well as from leptons.

3. ∆Rℓℓ > 0.2 : There will be suﬃciently large opening angle between the two leptons.

The SM cross section for the signal after the generation level cuts is 12.4 fb. We pass the HEP ﬁle
generated through Madgraph interfaced with Pythia into Delphes-3.1.2. The anti-kt algorithm
is used to construct jets and b-tagged jets are identiﬁed with a cone radius of 0.6. We use pT
dependent tagging eﬃciency for b-jets, namely, 0.7-0.5 for pT in the range 20-500 GeV. We also
use a mis-tagging eﬃciency of 0.001 for light jets and a pT dependent mis-tagging eﬃciency for
c-induced jets, which varies from 0.14-0.08 for 20 < pT < 500 GeV.

The major background to the signal comes from the following SM processes:

1. pp → b¯b ℓ+ℓ− (QCD)
2. pp → t¯t → b¯b ℓ+ℓ− ν ¯ν
3. pp → jj ℓ+ℓ− (QCD)
4. pp → Z ℓ+ℓ− → b¯b ℓ+ℓ− (EW)
To suppress the above sources of the background, we employ the following additional selection

cuts :

1. pTJ > 50 GeV

2. 105< MJ J < 130 GeV

3. |Mll − MZ| < 15 GeV
4. The pT of the reconstructed Z boson is taken to be > 150 GeV

The asymmetrical cut on the invariant mass of the two b-tagged jets (MJ J ) in the ﬁnal state around
the peak ( approximately 116 GeV) is helpful in suppressing backgrounds from pp → b¯b ℓ+ℓ− and
pp → Z ℓ+ℓ− → b¯b ℓ+ℓ− processes. We have taken such a window for the invariant mass of the two
b-tagged jets because owing to the eﬀects of hadronisation and showering, the peak of the invariant
mass distribution shifts from Mh to about 116 GeV. Thus we gain in terms of signal events by
choosing such an invariant mass cut. Further, requiring exactly two b-tagged jets in the ﬁnal state
signiﬁcantly reduces the background coming from pp → jj ℓ+ℓ−.
In order to suppress the t¯t backgrounds, use has been made of the fact that our signal events
are hermetic in the ideal situation. In contrast, similar ﬁnal states from the t¯t background will be
necessarily associated with missing-ET . Thus we propose to distinguish the signal by demanding
  ET < 20 GeV [36]. Moreover, no missing-pT pointing centrally is ensured by choosing |✁η| > 2.5,
where ✁η stands for the polar direction of the transverse momentum imbalance.

8

4.2 Observables

Next, we discuss two CP-odd, ˆT -odd quantities used in the rest of the analysis to isolate the
eﬀect of CP-odd couplings from the CP-even ones. These observables are constructed using the
3-momentum information of the ﬁnal state particles. The ﬁrst one , also discussed in Refs. [35, 36]
is given by,

O1 =

(~p+ × ~p−). ˆz
|~p+ × ~p−|

sign[(~p+ − ~p−). ˆz]

(6)

Here ~p+ and ~p− are the 3-momenta of ℓ+ and ℓ− respectively, and ˆz is the unit vector along the
incoming quark(or anti-quark) direction or the collision axis. The factor sign[(~p+ − ~p−). ˆz] is
the sign of the diﬀerence of the momentum projections of the outgoing leptons along the ˆz axis.
Since the dot product with the ˆz unit vector occurs twice in the deﬁnition of the observable, the
observable is rendered independent of the choice of the direction of the incoming quark momentum.
This is important in the context of LHC, as there is ambiguity associated with the momentum
direction of the initial quark with respect to which proton it is from. The deﬁnition of O1 removes
this ambiguity and makes it uniquely measurable.
The second observable that we consider uses pj1 and pj2, the three-momenta of the two b-tagged

jets in addition to the oppositely signed leptons in the ﬁnal state and is given as:

O2 =

((~pj1 + ~pj2) × (~p+ − ~p−)). ˆz
|(~pj1 + ~pj2) × (~p+ − ~p−)|

sign[(~p+ − ~p−). ˆz],

(7)

These observables are CP-odd and ˆT -odd, and thus generated from the dispersive part of the
amplitude. It should also be noted that, since the in-state partons from the two colliding proton
beams do not always carry equal momenta, the lab frame and the center of mass (cm) frame for
the colliding partons are in general diﬀerent. Thus, except for the cm frame i.e. when the two
initial partons come with the same x-value, where ~pj1 + ~pj2 + ~p+ + ~p− = 0, the observables O1
and O2 are distinct. Also, due to the showering eﬀects, an exact momentum balance between the
ﬁnal state b-jets and leptons does not hold true.The diﬀerence in the observables is evident from
their distributions. By deﬁnition, each of them ranges from -1.0 to +1.0.

The distinguishability of the CP-odd operators is quantiﬁed more eﬀectively in terms of the

asymmetries Ai deﬁned as:

Ai =

σ(Oi > 0) − σ(Oi < 0)
σ(Oi > 0) + σ(Oi < 0)

(8)

We show in Figs. 3 and 4 histograms of the diﬀerential cross section distributions corresponding
to observables O1 and O2 respectively. In both the ﬁgures, to tune in the CP-even Lagrangian,
we have taken the benchmark value fW W = −3.0 which corresponds to CZZh = 4.62 and CγZh
= 2.53. As for the CP-odd terms, we take the benchmark point as ˜fB = ˜fW = −30.77 such
that ˜CZZh = 40.0 and ˜CγZh = 0.0 (1). The histograms in the two ﬁgures are indicative of the
induced asymmetry in the distributions for both O1 and O2 when the CP-violating coupling is
turned on. It is important to note that unlike total rates and other CP-even observables which
depend on CP-odd couplings quadratically, a comparison of distributions from second and third
panel conﬁrms that these observables have linear dependence on ˜CZZh coupling in the numerator
of the expression for the asymmetry 8. The qualitative features of the histograms remain similar
when the ˜CγZh coupling is also taken to be non-zero and interference eﬀects of both ˜CZZh and
˜CγZh couplings are considered.

4.3 Asymmetries vs couplings

To assess the possibility of seeing the signatures of CP-violating physics in isolation, we need to
calculate the statistical signiﬁcance at which one can establish the existence of non-vanishing asym-
metry over and above the CP-conserving eﬀects coming from the SM background. If NS is the
number of signal events and NB the number of background events, then the observed asymmetry
Aobs
, corresponding to observable Oi at the detector is related to the theoretical asymmetry in the
signal distribution i.e. Ai, given in Eq. (8) by the following relation:

i

The statistical error in the observed asymmetry is given by,

i = Ai(cid:16) NS
Aobs

NS + NB

(cid:17)

∆Aobs

i =

1

√NS + NB

=

√N

,

(9)

(10)

where N = NS + NB is the total number of signal and background events. Using the above

information, the signiﬁcance S, associated with an observed asymmetry is given by [39],

S = Aobs

i

√N = Ai

and 3 ab−1, plotted for varying ˜CZZh. The benchmark points are chosen such that ˜CγZh = 0.0.

With this in mind, we plot the variation of the asymmetry against the value of the coupling
parameter ˜CZZh as shown in Figures 5 to 8. Figures 5 and 6 show the variation of asymmetry
for observables O1 and O2 respectively. For both of them we vary ˜CZZh keeping ˜CγZh = 0.0,
wheres Figures 7 and 8 show the asymmetry plots for the same observables, although this time
we ﬁx the ˜CγZh coupling at 1.5. For each of the Figures 5 to 8 we present the error bars on
the asymmetries for the various benchmark points. We have not included any speciﬁc values of
systematic uncertainties which can in principle change the asymmetries by a few percent.
Our calculations yield near vanishing asymmetry for SM and CP-even cases, which are consistent
with zero within 0.5σ for the chosen integrated luminosities. Looking at Figures 5 to 8 one can
infer that the statistical signiﬁcance improves as we go from a luminosity reach of 1 ab−1 to 3 ab−1.
For example, in Fig.5, we see that for ˜CZZh = 40.0, the sensitivity improves from 2σ to about 4σ
in going from 1 ab−1 to 3 ab−1. Another important feature to notice is that the asymmetry does
not monotonically increase as we increase the magnitude of the coupling parameter. This is due
to the fact that for higher values of couplings, the higher order terms, i.e. beyond the interference
term linear in ˜CZZh, become inﬂuential. This is corroborated by the marginal decrease in the
asymmetry curve beyond ˜CZZh = 40.0 in Figures 5 and 6. The analysis done here agrees at the
parton level to the work presented in [36], but once we fold in the ISR/FSR and detector eﬀects,
the statistical signiﬁcance gets lowered in comparison to what one gets for the parton level analysis.

5 Summary and Conclusions

We have looked for experimentally realizing the eﬀects of CP-violating operators that arise from
gauge-invariant dimension-6 V V h couplings. Values of the couplings consistent with electric dipole
moments as well as global ﬁts of the LHC data are taken. We have studied higgstrahlung processes
(pp → V h) in presence of both CP-even and CP-odd couplings. We have included eﬀects of parton
showers and also factored in detector simulation, to make our estimates as realistic as possible.
The presence of non vanishing asymmetries over and above the statistical errors is seen as the
litmus test for testing the presence of CP-violating new physics. To this end, we have shown that
for SM and CP-conserving dimension-6 operators, observables which are both CP and ˆT odd do
not yield any asymmetry in their kinematic distributions. But the presence of CP-violating gauge-
Higgs operators is seen to give rise to non-vanishing asymmetries for such observables, thus clearly
demarcating the presence of CP-violating high scale physics. We have been able to show that for
a benchmark value of ˜CZZh = 40.0, asymmetry can be established at about 4σ level with 3 ab−1
in the 14 TeV run of the LHC.
