ABSTRACT

We construct a class of quadratic gauge invariant actions for extended string ﬁelds
deﬁned on the tensor product of open superstring state space for multiple open
string Neveu-Schwarz (NS) sectors with or without one Ramond (R) sector. The
basic idea is the same as for the bosonic extended string ﬁeld theory developed by
the authors [1]. The theory for NSn sector and NSn−1-R sector contains general
n-th rank tensor ﬁelds and (n− 1)-th rank spinor-tensor ﬁelds in the massless
spectrum respectively.
In principle, consistent gauge invariant actions for any
generic type of 10-dimensional massive or massless tensor or spinor-tensor ﬁelds
can be extracted from the theory. We discuss some simple examples of bosonic
and fermionic massless actions.

Introduction

In the previous paper [1], the authors constructed an extended string ﬁeld theory (ESFT)

which describes massless higher spin ﬁelds accompanied with a tower of massive ﬁelds, in

hoping that it may give a possible ultraviolet completion of the higher spin gauge theory.

There the key ingredient is a tensor product of open string state space which naturally gives

higher spin ﬁelds at a massless level provided with the proper restriction of the states as an
extension of the L0 − ¯L0 = 0 condition for the closed string. Although the interaction is still
to be studied, both the gauge-invariant and the gauge-ﬁxed free actions of the various types

of higher rank tensor ﬁelds are systematically extracted from the quadratic action of ESFT.

In the present paper, we extend the above mentioned construction to include fermionic

ﬁelds i.e. higher rank spinor-tensor ﬁelds as well as bosonic pure tensor ﬁelds, especially

in a supersymmetric way. Thus we use the NSR formalism with GSO projection to setup

building blocks of open string state space. For the sake of brevity we only consider the

simplest supersymmetric case where the tensor product space consists of only two sectors,
namely NS⊗· · ·⊗NS and NS⊗· · ·⊗NS⊗R sectors, so that the resultant theory has N = 1
supersymmetry.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we brieﬂy review the free covariant

open superstring ﬁeld theory for NS and R sectors. We then show that the ‘a-gauges,’ which

is a class of covariant gauge ﬁxing conditions valid for bosonic string ﬁeld theory [2, 3], can be

extended to the superstring ﬁeld theory in both sectors. In the main section 3, we construct
free extended string ﬁeld theory for NSn and NSn−1-R sectors and discuss the properties of
the actions. Massless spectrum of these sectors generally includes higher-spin ﬁelds since it
is given by the n-th rank tensor ﬁeld and the (n− 1)-th rank spinor-tensor ﬁeld respectively.
We see that the basic structure of the actions for NSn and NSn−1-R sectors does not depend
on n. We then explicitly see the massless part of the actions and give some examples of gauge

invariant actions for several types of tensor or spinor-tensor ﬁelds. We close the section by

giving some comments. In the ﬁnal section 4, we give summary and some discussions. In

Appendix A, we summarize the basic properties of open superstring states and operators.

2 Quadratic action of superstring ﬁeld theory in NS

and R sectors

In this section, we ﬁrst recall the quadratic action of covariant open superstring ﬁeld theory

in NS and R sectors. We then see how the a-gauges [2, 3] can be extended to the gauge

invariant action in NS and R sectors.

2.1 State space and the gauge invariant action

The state spaces for NS and R sectors we use have the form

H(NS) = ˜F (NS) + c0 ˜F (NS),

H(R) = ˜F (R) + (γ0 + c0 ˜G0) ˜F (R).

(1)

Here the spaces ˜F (NS) and ˜F (R) consist of states with arbitrary number of non-zero modes
of matter (α, ψ) and ghost (b, c, β, γ) oscillators operated respectively on the ghost number

1 ground states

|0, p;↓;−1iNS ( = |0, pi ⊗ | ↓i ⊗ | − 1i ),
2i ). (2)
For the R sector, we use the constrained space H(R) following the formulation developed in
refs.[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Note that we choose the picture number −1 for the NS sector and − 1
2 for
the R sector as in ref. [9]. That is, the ground states | − 1i and | − 1

2iR ( = |0, p, ai ⊗ | ↓i ⊗ | − 1

|0, p, a;↓;− 1

2i satisfy

βr| − 1i = γr| − 1i = 0

(for r > 0),

βn| − 1

2i = 0 (for n ≥ 0),

γn| − 1

2i = 0 (for n > 0).

(3)

(4)

The number of independent matter ground states |0, p, ai (a = 1,· · · , 32) for the R sector
is 2D/2 = 32 which is equivalent to the dimension of 10-dimensional spinor. We regard the
operation of the fermion zero mode ˜ψ0

µ (= √2ψ0

µ) on |0, p, ai as

˜ψ0

µ|0, p, ai = |0, p, biΓµ

ba

(5)

ba denotes the 10-dimensional gamma matrix. In particular, for the operator ˜γ11

where Γµ
deﬁned by the product of all the ˜ψ0

9 · · · ˜ψ0
µ’s as ˜γ11 ≡ ˜ψ0
˜γ11|0, p, ai = |0, p, biΓ11

ba

0, the relation

(6)

holds for Γ11 = Γ0 · · · Γ9. We set that |0, p, ai is Grassmann even (or odd) if ˜γ11 = 1 (or
˜γ11 = −1). We introduce the projection operators

PL =

1

2(cid:0)1 + ˜γ11(cid:1) ,

PR =

1

2(cid:0)1 − ˜γ11(cid:1)

(7)

which respectively extract the ˜γ11 = ±1 component from the ground states {|0, p, ai}. We
often use the notation representing the ground state with ˜γ11 = ±1 as

|0, p, a : Li ≡ PL|0, p, a;↓;− 1
2i,

|0, p, a : Ri ≡ PR|0, p, a;↓;− 1
2i.
Note that |0, p, a : Li and |0, p, a : Ri are Grassmann odd and even respectively.

(8)

2

On the spaces H(NS) and H(R), BRST operators QNS and QR are deﬁned respectively.

They are divided by ghost zero modes as

QNS = ˜Q + c0L0 + b0M,
QR = ˜Q + c0L0 + b0M + γ0 ˜G0 + β0N − γ0

2b0.

(9)

(10)

The deﬁnition of ˜G0, ˜Q, M, and N with other details of the matter and ghost operators are
given in Appendix A.

String ﬁelds ΦNS and ˆΨR are expanded by the ghost number 1 string states within the
spaces H(NS) and H(R). For each state, we assign a tensor or spinor-tensor ﬁeld of appropriate
Grassmann property so that the string ﬁelds become Grassmann even in total, that is, all
ﬁelds within ΦNS are Grassmann even and those within ˆΨR are Grassmann odd. For future
convenience, we separate those string ﬁelds into two parts and represent

ΦNS = φ + c0ω,

ˆΨR = ψ + (γ0 + c0 ˜G0)χ

(11)

where φ, ω ∈ ˜F (NS) and ψ, χ ∈ ˜F (R). We also have to take into account the GSO projec-
tion [10] which is deﬁned by the G-parity operators

GNS = (−1)FNS,

GR = ˜γ11(−1)FR

where

FNS = Xr≥ 1
Xn=1

FR =

2
∞

(ψ−r · ψr + β−rγr − γ−rβr) − 1,

(ψ−n · ψn + β−nγn − γ−nβn) + γ0β0.

(12)

(13)

(14)

After performing the GSO projection and truncating the string ﬁelds to satisfy GNS,R = 1,
the gauge invariant action for each sector is written as

SR =

SNS =

2 hΦNS|QNSΦNSi ,
where hΦ| = (|Φi)† and h ˆΨR| = h ˆΨR| ˜ψ0
0 and δ′(γ0) = [δ(γ0), β0]. Details of Hermitian
conjugation and inner products are given in Appendix A. If we use the notation |·ii instead
of |·i as in eq.(A.40), in terms of the inner product notation hh·|| · ||·ii given by eqs.(A.34)-
(A.37), the gauge invariant action for each sector is rewritten as

Here we have used the decomposition of QNS,R:

QNS = ˜Q + c0L0 + b0M,
QR = ˜Q + c0L0 + b0M + γ0 ˜G0 + β0N − γ0

2b0.

Each action SNS or SR is invariant under the gauge transformation

δΦNS = QNSΛ,

δ ˆΨR = QR ˆΛ.

(18)

(19)

(20)

Here Λ ∈ HNS and ˆΛ ∈ HR are ghost number 0 string ﬁelds with GNS,R = 1. Note that
the gauge transformation is consistent with the GSO projection since [GNS,R, QNS,R] = 0 is
satisﬁed. By expressing the gauge parameter ﬁelds as Λ = λ + c0ρ and ˆΛ = λ + (γ0 + c0 ˜G0)ξ,
the gauge transformation is also rewritten as

NS:

R:

δφ = ˜Qλ + Mρ,

δψ = ˜Qλ +

2

δω = L0λ − ˜Qρ,

( ˜G0M + M ˜G0)ξ,

δχ = ˜G0λ + ˜Qξ.

(21)

(22)

Note that the NS action is divided into two local gauge invariant parts SNS = Smin

NS +
Sauxiliary
consistently as in the case of bosonic theory [2, 3] whereas the action SR does not
NS
have such decomposition. Note also that the sum SNS + SR has N = 1 supersymmetry in
D = 10 [11, 12] and the explicit form of the supersymmetry transformation is given e.g., in

[4]. We will see the explicit form of the transformation for the massless part of the action in

the next subsection.

2.2 Massless action and the supersymmetry transformation

We now explicitly see the properties of massless part of the action for later convenience.
From now on, we ﬁx α′ = 1. Massless ﬁelds are given by string states of level Nlevel = 1
2 for
NS sector and Nlevel = 0 for R sector. Thus the corresponding string ﬁelds in the form of
eq.(11) after GSO projection are

for R sector. Here the two ﬁelds Aµ and C in the NS sector are Grassmann even real ﬁelds
while ζa in the R sector is Grassmann odd left-handed real spinor ﬁeld. The action for each

sector can be given by substituting the above φm2=0 and ωm2=0 into SNS, and ψm2=0 (with
χm2=0 = 0) into SR. The result in the space-time representation is obtained after replacing

δǫAµ = ¯ǫΓµζ,

δǫC = 0,

δǫζ = i∂/AµΓµǫ − iCǫ.

(31)

where ǫ is a left-handed real spinor ﬁeld.

2.3 Gauge ﬁxing: extension of the a-gauges

We brieﬂy comment on the gauge ﬁxing problems for each sector by concentrating on the

possible extension of a-gauge conditions, a class of covariant gauges, introduced by the

present authors for the bosonic string ﬁeld theory in refs.[2, 3].

5

In the NS sector, since the structure of the state space and the BRST operator with

respect to ghost zero modes is similar to that of bosonic string theory, the a-gauge condi-

tions [2, 3] for the bosonic string ﬁeld theory can be applied to the action SNS straightfor-
wardly. That is, the gauge invariance of the action SNS is ﬁxed by the condition

a ˜Qφ + Mω = 0

(32)

for an arbitrary real parameter a (6= 1). For a = 0 and a = ∞, the condition respectively
corresponds to the Feynman-Siegel gauge and the Landau gauge. The gauge-ﬁxed action

can be constructed by introducing the string ﬁelds with all the ghost numbers as in the case

of bosonic string ﬁeld theory.

In the R sector, on the other hand, direct extension of the a-gauges for bosonic theory to

the action SR cannot be performed since the contributions from the superghost zero modes
γ0 and β0 should be taken into account. For example, the condition such as a ˜Qψ+M ˜G0χ = 0
does not completely ﬁx the gauge invariance of SR. We can however show that the modiﬁed
condition

a( ˜Qψ − Nχ) + M ˜G0χ = 0

(33)

for arbitrary a (6= 1) completely ﬁxes the gauge invariance for SR. We regard this class of
gauge conditions as the (modiﬁed) a-gauge for the R-sector. For a = 0, the condition is
reduced to χ = 0 and it coincides with the Feynman-Siegel gauge. For a = ∞, unlike the
bosonic or NS case, the condition does not have a particular property.

3 Construction of extended superstring ﬁeld theory

3.1 NSn sector

We construct the quadratic action of the extended string ﬁeld theory for NSn sector. This
can be accomplished by applying the similar procedure used for constructing the extended

bosonic string ﬁeld theory [1] since the state spaces for both theories have the same structure

with respect to the ghost zero modes. We ﬁrst provide the direct product space of n distinct

open string state spaces for NS sector as

HNSn(p) = H(1)

(NS)(p) ⊗ · · · ⊗ H(n)

(NS)(p)

and impose the condition on |fiNSn ∈ HNSn(p) as

(b(i)
0 − b(j)

0 )|fiNSn = 0,

6

(L(i)

0 − L(j)

0 )|fiNSn = 0

(34)

(35)

level = 0 since the operator L(i)

for i, j = 1,· · · , n. The latter equation of (35) is equivalent to the level matching condition
N (i)
level− N (j)
is written by using the level counting operator N (i)
level
as L(i)
2 . Here, ℓ is introduced as a scale factor instead of α′ of the case
of string theory n = 1 or 2. In the following, we ﬁx ℓ = √2 and αµ

0 = ℓ2p2/2 + N (i)

level − 1

0 = √2pµ.

We can construct the consistent extended string ﬁeld theory on the restricted space
H′
NSn (⊂ HNSn) which is spanned by states satisfying the condition (35). This space can be
divided into two parts

NSn = ˜FNSn + ˜c0 ˜FNSn

(41)

holds and the projection operators like Pk, Wk and Sk deﬁned for the bosonic extended
string ﬁeld theory [1] can also be deﬁned for our NSn sector theory. These operators play an
important role in constructing the gauge ﬁxed action for the a-gauges.

where O is an arbitrary operator consisting of matter and ghost oscillators without b0 and ˜c0.
Note that we can assume (−1)|O| = 1 since the left-hand side of eq.(44) vanishes otherwise.

The extended string ﬁeld ΦNSn for NSn sector is expanded by all states |f k(p)i ∈ H

If we divide the extended string ﬁeld as

ΦNSn = φ + ˜c0ω

(47)

(48)

according to the division eq.(36) and use the notation given in eq.(44) by replacing |φi → |φii
and |ωi → |ωii as in the case of n = 1 open string case, the action is represented by

1

SNSn = −

2(cid:16)(cid:10)(cid:10)φ||L0||φ(cid:11)(cid:11) −(cid:10)(cid:10)φ|| ˜Q||ω(cid:11)(cid:11) −(cid:10)(cid:10)ω|| ˜Q||φ(cid:11)(cid:11) −(cid:10)(cid:10)ω||M||ω(cid:11)(cid:11)(cid:17)
which is exactly the same form as the action for open NS sector eq.(16). Note that we regard
that the Grassmann parity of |φii and |ωii is (−1)n and (−1)n−1 respectively.

(49)

For D = 10, this action is invariant under the gauge transformation

δΦNSn = QNSnΛNSn

(50)

where ΛNSn is the ghost number Ng = n − 1 string ﬁeld which is expanded by ﬁelds in
H

with Ng = n − 1. The transformation can be rewritten in terms of φ and χ as

′(+,··· ,+)
NSn

δφ = ˜Qλ + Mρ,

δω = L0λ − ˜Qρ,

(51)

8

where ΛNSn = λ + ˜c0ρ. We see that the structure of the action and the gauge invariance is
parallel to that of bosonic string ﬁeld theory in NS sector. Thus, gauge-ﬁxing procedures

eﬀective for open string ﬁeld theory for NS sector can also be applied to our theory.

As in the case of bosonic theory, the action can be divided into two gauge invariant part:

can be decoupled
from the physical action Smin
NSn if we only deal with the quadratic action. However, if we
consider the supersymmetric action by combining with the fermionic action SNSn−1-R given
in the next subsection, the auxiliary ﬁelds in Sauxiliary
are necessary for representing the
supersymmetry transformation in a simple manner as in the case of n = 1 given in eq.(31).

3.2 NSn−1-R sector

We now construct the extended string ﬁeld theory for NSn−1-R sector. We provide the n−1
copies of the state space of NS sector and a state space of R sector and take the direct

product as

HNSn−1-R(p) = H(1)

(NS)(p) ⊗ · · · ⊗ H(n−1)

(NS) (p) ⊗ H(R)(p).

Then, we impose the condition on |fiNSn−1-R ∈ HNSn−1-R(p) as

(b(i)

(L(i)

For the spinor ﬁeld with totally anti-symmetric tensor indices φ[µ1···µn−1], the gauge invari-
ant action is not simple enough compared to that for bosonic totally antisymmetric tensor
ﬁeld B[µ1···µn] whose minimal Lagrangian is given by the form L ∼ Hµ1···µn+1H µ1···µn+1 by the
ﬁeld strength H of B. In fact, gauge invariant action for φ[µ1···µn−1] should contain the se-
quence of lower rank spinor-tensor ﬁelds φ′
(n−1,1)ii part, and
[µ1···µn−4], · · · from the |χm2=0
χ[µ1···µn−2], χ′
(n−1,1)ii part. Thus, the corresponding action includes
n− 2 kinds of lower rank fermionic ﬁelds other than the original φ[µ1···µn−1] ﬁeld in total. This
diﬀerence of properties between bosonic and fermionic actions results from the fact that the

[µ1···µn−5], · · · from the |ψm2=0

[µ1···µn−3], φ′′

bosonic action can be divided into two gauge invariant parts as eq.(52) while the fermionic

action does not have such a consistent decomposition. For example, the action for the 2nd
rank spinor-tensor ﬁeld φ[µν] includes two more ﬁelds φ′ and χµ. It can be calculated from
NS2-R action Sm2=0

NS2-R and the result is

Note that φµν and φ′ are the left-handed (Γ11 = 1) and χ is the right-handed (Γ11 = −1) real
fermionic ﬁelds. Similarly, in Sm2=0
NSn−1-R, all the ﬁelds belonging to |ψm2=0ii and |χm2=0ii are
left-handed and right-handed respectively. The above action Sm2=0
NS2-R,asym is invariant under
the gauge transformation

δφµν = 2∂[µλν],

δφ′ = ∂µλµ − /∂ξ,

δχµ = −/∂λµ + ∂µξ.

(89)

For any other general (n−1)-th rank mixed-symmetric spinor-tensor ﬁeld, we can similarly
extract the consistent gauge invariant action from the total action Sm2=0
NSn−1-R. Note that such
gauge invariant actions are classiﬁed by Young diagrams of n− 1 boxes as in the case of
tensor ﬁelds in the bosonic extended string ﬁeld theory [1].

3.4 Some comments

We give some comments on the actions SNSn and SNSn−1-R we have constructed above. The
basic structure of these actions does not depend on n and the properties of these actions are

parallel to those for n = 1 open superstring actions in NS and R sectors. For example, all the
ﬁelds in SNSn and SNSn−1-R are respectively bosonic and fermionic ﬁelds, and the action SNSn
can be divided into two consistent gauge invariant parts, minimal action part and auxiliary
ﬁelds part, while SNSn−1-R cannot. Also, no-ghost theorem is trivial from the structure of
the BRST operator in D = 10 and the physical degrees of freedom can be easily obtained

by counting the right-cone degrees of freedom.

On the other hand, concrete physical spectrum depends on n. For example, the number
of physical degrees of freedom of massless spectrum for both NSn and NSn−1-R sectors is
8n which is respectively described by the n-th rank tensor ﬁeld Aˆµ1···ˆµn and the n-th rank
left-handed real spinor-tensor ﬁeld φˆa
ˆµ1···ˆµn−1 where ˆµi represents the D − 2(= 8) transverse
degrees of freedom and ˆa the physical 8 degrees of freedom for the spinor index. Note that
the equations of motion for NSn−1-R sector reduce the number of spinor indices by half and
thus the number of massless degrees of freedom for both sectors coincides with each other.

There is also the inﬁnite tower of massive ﬁelds for both sectors and the number of physical

degrees of freedom also coincides with each other. This is natural since the total action
Sn = SNSn + SNSn−1-R should have N = 1 spacetime supersymmetry in D = 10. For n = 1,
this is reduced to the usual supersymmetry for open superstring theory. For n = 2, this
symmetry between NS-NS and NS-R sectors is a part of N = 2 supersymmetry of closed
superstring theory which is realized by including R-NS and R-R sectors in addition to the
two sectors. For general n, if we include all 2n sectors consisting of totally n NS and R parts
in addition to NSn and NSn−1-R sectors, we might be able to construct the theory with

15

N = n supersymmetry.

As to the construction of general sectors including more than two R parts, it is diﬃcult to

obtain an appropriate gauge invariant action in a straightforward way. For example, even for

the R-R sector, it is known that we cannot construct the consistent gauge invariant action
from the string ﬁeld on the tensor product of two state spaces H(R) ⊗H(R) with (or without)
simple restriction such as L0 − ¯L0 = 0 used for NS-NS or NS-R [5, 13]. In general, it is
possible to construct a consistent action by choosing a state space other than H(R) ⊗ H(R).
One example is given in ref.[13] where a certain gauge invariant action is constructed based
on an asymmetrically chosen state space of the form H′

We comment on the extension to general spacetime dimensions D 6= 10. As we have
seen above, since the BRST operator is nilpotent on general massless states for any D, the

(R) ⊗ H′′

(R).

massless part of the action is consistently applied for general D. For fermionic massless part
of the action Sm2=0
NSn−1-R, however, we have to be careful about the type of spinors when we
apply the action to a particular spacetime dimensions other than D = 10. For example, for

D = 4, the left-handed real spinor-tensor ﬁelds (φ, ω and χ) appearing in the action eq.(85)

should be interpreted as general Weyl (or Majorana) spinors. The similar reinterpretation

is needed when we apply the actions to general D.

4 Summary and discussion

We have constructed the consistent quadratic gauge invariant actions for extended super-
string ﬁeld theory for NSn and NSn−1-R sectors. The corresponding actions SNSn and
SNSn−1-R are extensions of those for NS and R sectors of open superstring ﬁeld theory. The
massless spectrum of the theories for NSn and NSn−1-R sectors in general includes higher-spin
gauge ﬁelds represented by general n-th rank tensor ﬁelds and spinor-tensor ﬁelds respec-

tively. From the actions, we are able to extract general quadratic gauge invariant actions for

any type of tensor or spinor-tensor ﬁelds.

For massless ﬁelds, the actions for n-th rank tensor ﬁelds or spinor-tensor ﬁelds are

classiﬁed by Young diagrams of n boxes. The simplest examples are the actions eqs.(77)

and (85) which are respectively for totally symmetric tensor and spinor-tensor ﬁelds. For

a general mixed-symmetric tensor or spinor-tensor ﬁeld represented by a certain Young

diagram, we can obtain the explicit form of the action by extracting the corresponding part
from SNSn or SNSn−1-R and calculating the inner products of extended string states. The
actions for bosonic ﬁelds are the same as the ones obtained from the bosonic extended string

ﬁeld theory given in ref.[3] except for the space-time dimensions. For fermionic ﬁelds, the

16

structure of the actions are more complicated than that for bosonic ﬁelds as we have seen in

the example of massless anti-symmetric ﬁeld in the previous section.

Note that there have been various attempts of constructing consistent actions or ﬁeld

equations for general higher-spin ﬁelds in ﬂat spacetime (e.g., [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]).

From the perspective of constructing a consistent gauge invariant action for general higher-

spin ﬁeld represented by an unconstrained (spinor-)tensor ﬁeld in ﬂat spacetime, our method

has certain advantages since the gauge invariance and the no-ghost theorem are trivial and

covariant gauge ﬁxing is straightforward. Note also that the actions for massless ﬁelds can

also be obtained from the tensionless limit of open superstring ﬁeld theory for NS or R sector.

Since we have successfully constructed the free extended superstring ﬁeld theories as well

as the bosonic ones, our next task is to see whether we could also construct the consistent

interaction terms. For this purpose, we would like to analyze the structure of the known

interaction terms for open and closed string ﬁeld theory and study whether it is possible

to extend them to the n > 2 case. This should be a challenging task since we do not even

know what is the physical objects represented by the theories for n > 2. On the contrary,

we may take more algebraic approach such as A∞/L∞. We would like to tackle the problem
for the simpler bosonic extended string ﬁeld theory by using the gauge invariance structure

as a hint.

Commutation relations for these operators are

Ghost number operator and the SU(1,1) algebra Ghost number operator Ng deﬁned

Thus the ground states given by eqs.(2) have ghost number Ng = 1. The operator ˆNg counts
the ghost number of the ghost non-zero mode part. We can check the relations

[ ˆNg, ˜Q] = ˜Q,

[ ˆNg, M] = 2M,

[ ˆNg, N] = 2N.

Inner products

rules:

Inner product for spaces H(NS) and H(R) we use is given by the following

h0, p′|0, pi = (2π)Dδ(D)(p − p′),

NS:

h−1| − 1i = 1,

h↓ |c0| ↓i = h0|c−1c0c1|0i = 1,
R:

h− 1

2|δ(γ0)| − 1

2i = 1.

Thus,

for NS and

NSh0, p′;↓;−1|c0|0, p;↓;−1iNS = (2π)Dδ(D)(p − p′)

h0, p′, a′ : L|c0δ(γ0)|0, p, a : Li = (2π)Dδ(D)(p − p′)δaa′
h0, p′, a′ : R|c0δ(γ0)|0, p, a : Ri = −(2π)Dδ(D)(p − p′)δaa′

(A.27)

(A.28)

(A.29)

(A.30)

(A.31)

for R. Here |0, p, a : Li = PL|0, p, a;↓;− 1
2i as is deﬁned
in eq.(8). Note that the minus sign of the right-hand side of (A.31) is due to the fact that
PR|0, p, ai is Grassmann odd.

2i and |0, p, a : Ri = PR|0, p, a;↓;− 1

For two states |f (p)i(= Of|0, p;↓;−1iNS) and |g(p′)i(= Og|0, p;↓;−1iNS) in the NS sec-

tor, we deﬁne the inner product as

hg(p′)|f (p)i = NSh0, p′;↓;−1|Og

†Of|0, p;↓;−1iNS,

(A.32)

20

which can be calculated by commutation relations for operators and the deﬁnition of inner

product for ground state (A.29). We can deﬁne the inner product for any two states in the

R sector in a similar manner. Note that in the R sector, when constructing the quadratic
action, we use hf| ≡ hf| ˜ψ0
0 instead of just taking the Hermitian conjugate as hf|. For a
string ﬁeld which is given by the inﬁnite sum of string states with the corresponding ﬁelds,
the relation between |Φi and hΦ| is

|Φi(= Φ) =Z dDp

(2π)D Xi

|fi(p)iφfi(p),

hΦ| =Z dDp

(2π)D Xi

φ∗
fi(−p)hfi(p)|.

(A.33)

For convenience, we often use another notation of inner product which does not include

c0,±1 nor γ0 given by the right-hand side of the following equations:

NSh0, p′;↓;−1|Oc0|0, p;↓;−1iNS ≡ hh0, p′||O||0, pii,
h0, p′, a′ : L|Oc0δ(γ0)|0, p, a : Li ≡ hh0, p′a′||O||0, p, aii,
h0, p′, a′ : R|Oc0δ(γ0)|0, p, a : Ri ≡ −hh0, p′, a′||O||0, p, aii

(A.34)

(A.35)

(A.36)

where O is an arbitrary operator consisting only of matter and ghost oscillators without
ghost zero modes and

hh0, p′||1||0, pii = (2π)Dδ(D)(p − p′),
The right-hand sides of above three equations (A.34)-(A.36) vanish when (−1)|O| = −1 if O
consists only if matter and ghost oscillators. For the R sector, eqs.(A.35) and (A.36) can be

hh0, p′, a′||1||0, p, aii = (2π)Dδ(D)(p − p′)δa,a′.

(A.37)

rewritten as a united form

h0, p′, a′ : L(R)|Oc0δ(γ0)˜γ11|0, p, a : L(R)i ≡ hh0, p′a′||O||0, p, aii

(A.38)

and we use this new notation only for the GSO projected state space. Note also that
the essence of the above relations for both sectors is the relation h0, p′|c−1Oc0c1|0, pi ≡
hh0, p′||O||0, pii, i.e., the new notation of inner product corresponds to deﬁning another state
space spanned by states |f (p)ii instead of original |f (p)i. In concrete, for a state

|f (p)i = Of|0, p;↓;−1iNS

or

|f (p)i = Of|0, p, a : L(R)i,

(A.39)

|f (p)ii is deﬁned as

|f (p)ii = (−1)|Of |Of|0, pii

or

|f (p)ii = (−1)|Of |Of|0, p, aii

(A.40)

21

where |0, pii (or |0, p, aii ) is regarded as a new ground state satisfying bn|0, pii = cn|0, pii = 0
for n > 0. For example, the NS string ﬁeld ΦNS = φ + c0ω can be expanded by

φ (= |φi) = Z dDp
ω (= |ωi) = Z dDp

(2π)D Xi
(2π)D Xi

Ofi|0, p;↓;−1iNSφfi(p),

O′
gi|0, p;↓;−1iNSωgi(p)

where (−1)|Ofi | = −1 and (−1)|O′

gi

| = 1. Then, if we write

then the inner product can be expressed as

|φii = −Z dDp
(2π)D Xi
|ωii = Z dDp
(2π)D Xi
O′
gi|0, piiωgi(p),

Ofi|0, piiφfi(p),

hω|c0M · |ωi = hhω|| · ||ωii.

(A.41)

(A.42)

(A.43)

(A.44)

(A.45)

(A.46)

Note that we apply the new notation of inner product in the right-hand side of eqs.(A.45)

and (A.46). The minus sign in the right-hand side of the former equation (A.45) comes from

the relation

h0, p′|c−1O†

f ′c0Of c1|0, pi = −h0, p′|c−1O†

f ′Of c0c1|0, pi = −hh0, p′||O†

f ′Of||0, pii

(A.47)

since (−1)|Of | = (−1)|Of ′ | = −1.

Supersymmetry transformation for massless ﬁelds Supersymmetry transformation

can be constructed by the fermion emission vertex W (z) [11, 12]. The explicit form of the

transformation for the action SNS + SR is given in ref.[4] as
