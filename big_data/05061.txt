Abstract

In this article we oﬀer the interpretation of the fermionic T-duality of the type II
superstring theory in double space. We generalize the idea of double space doubling
the fermionic sector of the superspace.
In such doubled space fermionic T-duality
is repersented as permutation of the fermionic coordinates θα and ¯θα with the cor-
responding fermionic T-dual ones, ϑα and ¯ϑα, respectively. Demanding that T-dual
transformation law has the same form as inital one, we obtain the known form of the
fermionic T-dual NS-R i R-R background ﬁelds. Fermionic T-dual NS-NS background
ﬁelds are obtained under some assumptions. We conclude that only symmetric part
of R-R ﬁeld strength and symmetric part of its fermionic T-dual contribute to the
fermionic T-duality transformation of dilaton ﬁeld and analyze the dilaton ﬁeld in
fermionic double space. As a model we use the ghost free action of type II superstring
in pure spinor formulation in approximation of constant background ﬁelds up to the
quadratic terms.

Introduction

Two theories T-dual to one another can be viewed as being physically identical [1, 2].
T-duality presents an important tool which shows the equivalence of diﬀerent geometries
and topologies. The useful T-duality procedure was ﬁrst introduced by Buscher [3].

Until recently only T-duality along bosonic coordinates has been considered. Analyzing
the gluon scattering amplitudes in N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory, a new kind of T-
dual symmetry, fermionic T-duality, was discovered [4, 5]. Mathematically, fermionic

T-duality is realized within the same procedure as bosonic one, except that dualization
is performed along fermionic variables. So, it can be considered as a generalization of
Buscher T-duality. Fermionic T-duality consists in certain non-local redeﬁnitions of the
fermionic variables of the superstring mapping a supersymmetric background to another
supersymmetric background. In Refs.[4, 5] it was shown fermionic T-duality maps gluon
scattering amplitudes in the original theory to Wilson loops in the dual one. Relation
between fermionic T-duality and open string noncommutativity was considered in Ref.[6].
Mathematical realization of T-duality is given by Buscher T-dualization procedure [3],
which is considered as standard one. There are also other frameworks in which we can
represent T-dualization which should agree with the Buscher procedure. It is double space
formalism which was the subject of the articles about twenty years ago [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
Double space is spanned by coordinates Z M = (xµ yµ)T (µ = 0, 1, 2, . . . , D − 1), where xµ
and yµ are the coordinates of the D-dimensional initial and T-dual space-time, respectively.
Interest for this subject emerged recently with papers [12, 13, 14, 15, 16], where T-duality
along some subset of d coordinates is considered as O(d, d) symmetry transformation and
[17, 18], where it is considered as permutation of d initial with corresponding d T-dual
coordinates.

In this article we use the idea of double space in order to interpret fermionic T-duality.
The fermionic T-duality assumes dualization along fermionic coordinates. So, we are go-
ing to double fermionic sector of superspace adding to the coordinates θα and ¯θα their
fermionic T-duals, ϑα and ¯ϑα, where index α counts independent real components of the
spinors, α = 1, 2, . . . , 16. Rewriting T-dual transformation laws in terms of the double co-
ordinates, ΘA = (θα, ϑα) and ¯ΘA = (¯θα, ¯ϑα), we deﬁne the ”fermionic generalized metric”
FAB and the generalized currents ¯J+A and J−A. The permutation matrix T A
B exchnges
¯θα and θα with their T-dual partners, ¯ϑα and ϑα, respectively. From the requirement
B ¯ΘB, have the same
that fermionic T-dual coordinates, ⋆ΘA = T A
transformation law as initial ones, ΘA and ¯ΘA, we obtain the expressions for fermionic
T-dual generalized metric, ⋆FAB = (T F T )AB, and T-dual currents, ⋆ ¯J+A = TA
B ¯J+B and
⋆J−A = TA
B J−B, in terms of the initial ones. These expressions produce the expression
for fermionic T-dual NS-R ﬁelds and R-R ﬁeld strength. Expressions for fermionic T-dual
metric and Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld are obtained separatly under some assumptions. We con-
clude that only symmetric part of R-R ﬁeld strength, F αβ
2 (F αβ +F βα), and symmetric
part of its fermionic T-dual, ⋆F s
2 (⋆Fαβ + ⋆Fβα), give contribution to the dilaton ﬁeld
transformation under fermionic T-duality. We also investigate the dilaton ﬁeld in double
space.

2 Type II superstring and fermionic T-duality

In this section we will introduce the action of type II superstring theory in pure spinor
formulation and perform fermionic T-duality [4, 5, 6] using fermionic analogue of Buscher
rules [3].

2.1 Action

The action of type II superstring theory in pure spinor formulation up to the quadratic
terms, neglecting ghost terms [21, 22, 23, 19, 20], is of the form

παP αβ ¯πβ(cid:21) ,

where the world sheet Σ is parameterized by ξm = (ξ0 = τ , ξ1 = σ) and ∂± = ∂τ ± ∂σ.
Bosonic part of superspace is spanned by coordinates xµ (µ = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9), while the
fermionic one is spanned by θα and ¯θα (α = 1, 2, . . . , 16). The variables πα and ¯πα are
canonically conjugated momenta to θα and ¯θα, respectively. All spinors are Majorana-
Weyl ones, which means that each of them has 16 independent real components. We
introduce the ﬁeld combination

Π±µν = Bµν ±

1
2

Gµν ,

(2.2)

Φ

where Gµν is metric tensor and Bµν is Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld. The R-R background ﬁeld
has a form P αβ = e
2 F αβ, where F αβ is R-R ﬁeld strength and Φ is dilaton ﬁeld. Here
we use the world-sheet metric gαβ in conformal gauge gαβ = e2F (τ,σ)ηαβ, where ηαβ is 2
dimensional ﬂat metric. Scalar curvature with respect to the world-sheet metric is denoted
by R(2). All background ﬁelds are constant.

Here we work both with type IIA and type IIB superstring theory. The diﬀerence
is in the chirality of NS-R background ﬁelds and content of R-R sector. In NS-R sector
there are two gravitino ﬁelds Ψα
µ which are Majorana-Weyl spinors of the opposite
chirality in type IIA and same chirality in type IIB theory. The same feature stands for
the pairs of spinors (θα, ¯θα) and (πα, ¯πα). The R-R ﬁeld strength F αβ is expressed in
terms of the antisymmetric tensors F(k) = Fµ1µ2...µk [1]

is basis of completely antisymmetrized product of gamma matrices and C is charge con-
jugation operator. For more technical details regarding gamma matrices see the ﬁrst
reference in [1].

R-R ﬁeld strength satisﬁes the chirality condition Γ11F = ±F Γ11, where Γ11 is a
product of gamma matrices in D = 10 dimensional space-time. The sign + corresponds
to type IIA while sign − corresponds to type IIB superstring theory. Consequently, type
IIA theory contains only even rank tensors F(k), while type IIB contains only odd rank
tensors. For type IIA the independent tensors are F(0), F(2) and F(4), while independent
tensors for type IIB are F(1), F(3) and self-dual part of F(5).

The fermionic part of the action (2.1) has the form of the ﬁrst order theory. We
want to eliminate the fermionic momenta and work with the action expressed in terms of
coordinates and their derivatives. So, on the equations of motion for fermionic momenta
πα and ¯πα,

2.2 Fixing the chiral gauge invariance

In the above action θα appears only in the form ∂−θα and ¯θα in the form ∂+ ¯θα. This
means that the theory has a local symmetry

δθα = εα(σ+) ,

δ ¯θα = ¯εα(σ−) ,

(σ± = τ ± σ) .

(2.7)

We will treat this symmetry within BRST formalism. The corresponding BRST transfor-
mations are

sθα = cα(σ+) ,

s¯θα = ¯cα(σ−) ,

(2.8)

where for each gauge parameter εα(σ+) and ¯εα(σ−) we introduced the ghost ﬁelds cα(σ+)
and ¯cα(σ−), respectively. Here s is BRST nilpotent operator.

To ﬁx gauge freedom we introduce gauge fermion with ghost number −1

where ααβ is arbitrary non singular matrix, ¯Cα and Cα are antighost ﬁelds, while b+α and
¯b−α are Nakanishi-Lautrup auxillary ﬁelds which satisfy

sCα = b+α ,

s ¯Cα = ¯b−α ,

sb+α = 0 s¯b−α = 0 .

(2.10)

BRST transformation of gauge fermion Ψ produces the gauge ﬁxed and Fadeev-Popov
action

κ

(2.11)

The Fadeev-Popov action is decoupled from the rest and, consequently, it can be omitted
in further analysis. On the equations of motion for b-ﬁelds

b+α = −(α−1)αβ∂+θα ,

¯b−α = −∂− ¯θβ(α−1)βα ,

(2.12)

we obtain the ﬁnal form of the BRST gauge ﬁxed action

(2.13)

2.3 Fermionic T-duality

We will perform fermionic T-duality using fermionic version of Buscher procedure similarly
to Refs.[6] where we worked without chiral gauge ﬁxing. After introducing Sgf the action
still has a global shift symmetry in θα and ¯θα directions. We introduce gauge ﬁelds vα
±
and ¯vα

∂±θα → D±θα ≡ ∂±θα + vα
± ,

∂± ¯θα → D± ¯θα ≡ ∂± ¯θα + ¯vα
± .

(2.14)

In order to make the ﬁelds vα

(ﬁrst relations of (2.19) and (2.20)), we would have only constraints on the T-dual vari-
ables, ∂− ¯ϑα = 0 and ∂+ϑα = 0. Consequently, integration over vα

singular and we would loose the part of T-dual transformations (2.29) and (2.31).

3 Fermionic T-dualization in fermionic double space

In this section we will extend the meaning of the double space. We will introduce dou-
ble fermionic space adding to the fermionic coorinates, θα and ¯θα, the fermionic T-dual
ones, ϑα and ¯ϑα. Then we will show that fermionic T-dualization can be represented as
permutation of the appropriate fermionic coordinates and their T-dual partners.

3.1 Transformation laws in fermionic double space

In the same way as the double bosonic coordinates were introduced [7, 17, 18], we double
both fermionic coordinate as

ΘA =  θα

ϑα ! ,

¯ΘA =  ¯θα

¯ϑα ! .

(3.1)

Each double coordinate has 32 real components. In terms of the double fermionic coordi-
nates the transformation laws, (2.28)-(2.31), can be rewritten in the form

∂−ΘA ∼= −ΩAB(cid:2)FBC ∂−ΘC + J−B(cid:3) ,

∂+ΘA ∼= −ΩABABC ∂+ΘC ,

∂+ ¯ΘA ∼=(cid:2)∂+ ¯ΘC FCB + ¯J+B(cid:3) ΩBA ,

∂− ¯ΘA ∼= ∂− ¯ΘC ACBΩBA ,

FAB is bosonic variable but we put the name fermionic because it appears in the case of
fermionic T-duality.

The double currents, ¯J+A and J−A, are fermionic variables of the form

¯J+A =  ( ¯ΨP −1)µα∂+xµ

where identity matrix is 16 × 16. By straightforward calculation we can prove the relations

Ω2 = 1 ,

Consistency of the transforation laws (3.2) produces

(ΩF)2 = 1 , J− = FΩJ− ,

¯J+ = − ¯J+ΩF .

(3.8)

(3.9)

3.2 Double action

It is well known that equations of motion of initial theory are Bianchi identities in T-dual
picture and vice versa. As a consequence of the identities

∂+∂−ΘA − ∂−∂+ΘA = 0 ,

∂+∂− ¯ΘA − ∂−∂+ ¯ΘA = 0 ,

(3.10)

known as Bianchi identities, and relations (3.2) and (3.3), we obtain the consistency con-
ditions

∂+(FAB∂−ΘB + J−A) − ∂−(AAB∂+ΘB) = 0 ,
∂−(∂+ ¯ΘBFBA + ¯J+A) − ∂+(∂− ¯ΘBABA) = 0 .

The equations (3.11) and (3.12) are equations of motion of the following action

where L(x) is arbitrary functional of the bosonic coordinates.

3.3 Fermionic T-dualization of type II superstring theory as permuta-

tion of fermionic coordinates in double space

In order to exchange θα with ϑα and ¯θ with ¯ϑα, let us introduce the permutation matrix

T A

B =  0 1

1 0 ! ,

so that double T-dual coordinates are

⋆ΘA = T A

BΘB ,

⋆ ¯ΘA = T A

B ¯ΘB .

(3.14)

(3.15)

We demand that T-dual transformation laws for double T-dual coordinates ⋆ΘA and

⋆ ¯ΘA have the same form as for initial ones ΘA and ¯ΘA (3.2) and (3.3)

∂−

⋆ΘA ∼= −ΩAB(cid:2)⋆FBC ∂−

⋆ΘC + ⋆J−B(cid:3) ,

(3.16)
(3.17)
Then the fermionic T-dual ”generalized metric” ⋆FAB and T-dual currents, ⋆ ¯J+A and
⋆J−A, with the help of (3.15) and (3.2), can be expressed in terms of initial ones

⋆ΘA ∼= −ΩAB ⋆ABC ∂+

⋆ ¯J+A = TA

⋆J−A = TA

B J−B .

(3.18)

The matrix AAB transforms as

⋆AAB = TA

C ACDT D

B = (A−1)AB .

(3.19)

Note that, as well as bosonic case, double space action (3.13) has global symmetry under
transformations (3.15) if the conditions (3.18) are satisﬁed.

From the ﬁrst relation in (3.18) we obtain the form of the fermionic T-dual R-R

background ﬁeld

⋆Pαβ = (P −1)αβ ,

(3.20)

while from the second and third equation we obtain the form of the fermionic T-dual NS-R
background ﬁelds

⋆Ψαµ = (P −1)αβΨβ
µ ,

⋆ ¯Ψαµ = − ¯Ψβ

µ(P −1)βα .

The non singular matrix ααβ transforms as

(⋆α)αβ = (α−1)αβ .

(3.21)

(3.22)

The expressions (3.20)-(3.22) are in full agreement with the relations (2.24) and (2.25)
obtained by the standard fermionic Buscher procedure. Consequently, we showed that
permutation of fermionic coordinates deﬁned in (3.14) and (3.15) completely reproduces
fermionic T-dual R-R and NS-R background ﬁelds.

2 Ψα

µ(P −1)αβΨβ

The expression Π+µν + 1
ν appears in the action (2.6) coupled with ∂±xµ,
along which we do not T-dualize.
It is an analogue of ij-term of Refs.[12, 13] where
xi coordinates are not T-dualized, and αβ-term in [24] where fermionic directions are
undualized.

Taking into account the form of the doubled action (3.13) we suppose that term L(x)

has the form

L(x) = 2∂+xµ (Π+µν + ⋆Π+µν ) ∂−xν ≡ L + ⋆L ,

(3.23)

where Π+µν is deﬁned in (2.2) and ⋆Π+µν is fermionic T-dual which we are going to ﬁnd.
This term should be invariant under T-dual transformation

⋆L = L + ∆L .

(3.24)

Using the fact that two successive T-dualization are identity transformation, we obtain

Combining last two relations we get

L = ⋆L + ⋆∆L .

⋆∆L = −∆L .

If ∆L = 2∂+xµ∆µν ∂−xν, we obtain the condition for ∆µν

⋆∆µν = − ∆µν .

(3.25)

(3.26)

(3.27)

Using the relations (2.24) and (2.25) we realize that, up to multiplication constant,

combination

satisﬁes the condition (3.27). So, we conclude that

∆µν = ¯Ψα

µ(P −1)αβΨβ
ν ,

⋆Π+µν = Π+µν + c ¯Ψα

µ(P −1)αβΨβ
ν ,

(3.28)

(3.29)

where c is an arbitrary constant. For c = 1
2 we obtain the relations (2.27). So, in double
space formulation the fermionic T-dual NS-NS background ﬁelds can be obtained up to
an arbitrary constant under assumption that two successive T-dualizations produce initial
action.

4 Dilaton ﬁeld in double fermionic space

Dilaton ﬁeld transformation under fermionic T-duality is considered [4]. Here we will
discuss some new features of dilaton transformation under fermionic T-duality as well as
the dilaton ﬁeld in fermionic double space.

Because the dilaton transformation has quantum origin we start with the path integral

for the gauge ﬁxed action given in Eq.(2.17)

Z =Z d¯vα

+d¯vα

−dvα

+dvα

−d ¯ϑαdϑαei Sf ix(v±,¯v±,∂±ϑ,∂± ¯ϑ) .

(4.1)

For constant background case, after integration over the fermionic gauge ﬁelds ¯vα
we obtain the generating functional Z in the form

± and vα
±,

Z =Z d ¯ϑαdϑα det(cid:2)(P −1α−1)αβ(cid:3)ei ⋆S(ϑ, ¯ϑ) ,

(4.2)

where ⋆S(ϑ, ¯ϑ) is T-dual action given in Eq.(2.21). We are able to perform such integration
thank to the facts that we ﬁxed the gauge in subsection 2.2.

Note that here we multiplied with determinants of P −1 and α−1 because we integrate
±. We can choose that det α = 1, and the generating

± and ¯vα

over Grassman ﬁelds vα
functional gets the form

Z =Z d ¯ϑαdϑα det(cid:2)(P −1)αβ(cid:3)ei ⋆S(ϑ, ¯ϑ) .

This produces the fermionic T-dual transformation of dilaton ﬁeld

⋆Φ = Φ + ln det(cid:2)(P −1)αβ(cid:3) = Φ − ln det P αβ .

Let us calculate det P αβ using the expression

(P P −1

It is obvious that two successive T-dualizations act as identity transformation

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

We can conclude that only symmetric parts of the R-R ﬁeld strengths give contribution
to the transformation of dilaton ﬁeld under fermionic T-duality. In type IIA superstring
theory R-R ﬁeld strength F αβ contains thensors F A
µνρλ, while in type IIB
F αβ contains F B
µνρλω. Using the conventions for gamma
matrices from the appendix of the ﬁrst reference in [1] (see Appendix A), we conclude
that symmetric part of F αβ in type IIA contains scalar F A
µν , while
in type IIB superstring theory it contains 1-rank F B

F B

Let us write the path integral for double action (3.13)

Zdouble =Z dΘAd ¯ΘAeiSdouble(Θ, ¯Θ) .

(4.16)

Because det F = 1 and det A = 1 we obtain that dilaton ﬁeld in double space is invariant
under fermionic T-duality. Consequently, a new dilaton should be introduced (see [17, 18]),
invariant under T-duality transformations. Because of the relation (4.15) we deﬁne the
T-duality invariant dilaton as

Φinv =

5 Concluding remarks

In this article we considered the fermionic T-duality of the type II superstring theory using
the double space approach. We used the action of the type II superstring theory in pure
spinor formulation neglecting ghost terms and keeping all terms up to the quadratic ones
which means that all background ﬁelds are constant.

Using equations of motion with respect to the fermionic momenta πα and ¯πα we elim-
inate them from the action. We obtained the action expressed in terms of the derivatives
∂±xµ, ∂−θα and ∂+ ¯θα, where θα and ¯θα are fermionic coordinates. Because θα appears
in the action in the form ∂−θα and ¯θα in the form ∂+ ¯θα, there is a local chiral gauge
symmetry with parameters depending on σ± = τ ± σ. We ﬁxed this gauge invariance
using BRST approach.

Using the Buscher approach we performed fermionic T-duality procedure and obtained
It is obvious that two successive
they are equivalent to the identity

the form of the fermionic T-dual background ﬁelds.
fermionic T-dualization produces initial theory i.e.
transformation.

In the central point of the article we generalize the idea of double space and show
that fermionic T-duality can be represented as permutation in fermionic double space. In
the bosonic case double space spanned by coordinates Z M = (xµ, yµ) can be obtained
adding T-dual coordinates yµ to the initial ones xµ. Using analogy with the bosonic case
we introduced double fermionic space doubling the initial coordinates θα and ¯θα with
their fermionic T-duals, ϑα and ¯ϑα. Double fermionic space is spanned by the coordinates
ΘA = (θα, ϑα) and ¯ΘA = (¯θα, ¯ϑα).

T-dual transformation laws and their inverse ones are rewritten in fermionic double
space by single relation introducing the fermionic generalized metric FAB and currents J−A
and ¯J+A. Demanding that transformation laws for fermionic T-dual double coordinates,
B ¯ΘB, are of the same form as those for ΘA and ¯ΘA,
⋆ΘA = T A
we obtained fermionic T-dual generalized metric ⋆FAB and currents ⋆J−A and ⋆ ¯J+A.
These transformations act as symmetry transformations of the double action (3.13). They
produce the form of the fermionic T-dual NS-R and R-R background ﬁelds which are in
full accordance with the results obtained by standard Buscher procedure.

BΘB and ⋆ ¯ΘA = T A

The expressions for T-dual metric ⋆Gµν and Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld ⋆Bµν cannot be found
from double space formalism because they do not appear in the T-dual transformation
laws. These expressions, up tp arbitrary constant, are obtained assuming that two suc-
cessive T-dualization act as identity transformation.

We considered transformation of dilaton ﬁeld under fermionic T-duality. We derived
the transformation law for dilaton ﬁeld and concluded that just symmetric parts of R-R
ﬁeld strengths, F αβ
αβ, aﬀected the dilaton transformation law. This means that in
the case of type IIA scalar and 2-rank tensor have inﬂuence on the dilaton transformation,

and ⋆F s

while in the case of type IIB 1-rank tensor and self-dual part of 5-rank tensor take that
role.

Therefore, we extended T-dualization in double space to the fermionic case. We proved
that permutation of fermionic coordinates with corresponding T-dual ones in double space
is equivalent to the fermionic T-duality along initial coordinates θα and ¯θα.

A Gamma matrices

In the appendix of the ﬁrst reference of [1] one speciﬁc representation of gamma matrices
is given. Here we will calculate the transopsitions of basis matrices (CΓ(k))αβ for k =
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, where C is charge conjugation operator.

The charge conjugation operator is antisymmetric matrix, C T = −C, and it acts on

gamma matrices as

Now we have

CΓµC −1 = −(Γµ)T .

(CΓµ)T = (Γµ)T C T = −(Γµ)T C = CΓµC −1C = CΓµ ,

(CΓµΓν)T = CΓµΓν =⇒ (CΓ[µν])T = CΓ[µν] ,

(CΓµΓνΓρ)T = −CΓµΓνΓρ =⇒ (CΓ[µνρ])T = −CΓ[µνρ] ,

(CΓµΓνΓρΓλ)T = −CΓµΓνΓρΓλ =⇒ (CΓ[µνρλ])T = −CΓ[µνρλ] ,

(CΓµΓνΓρΓλΓω)T = CΓµΓνΓρΓλΓω =⇒ (CΓ[µνρλω])T = CΓ[µνρλω] .
