Using numerical simulations of two-photon electronic absorption with femtosecond pulses in Na2
we show that:
i) it is possible to avoid the characteristic saturation or dumped Rabi oscillations
in the yield of absorption by time-delaying the laser pulses; ii) it is possible to accelerate the onset
of adiabatic passage by using the vibrational coherence starting in a wave packet; and iii) it is
possible to prepare the initial wave packet in order to achieve full state-selective transitions with
broadband pulses. The ﬁndings can be used, for instance, to achieve ultrafast adiabatic passage by
light-induced potentials and understand its intrinsic robustness.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Many technological and chemical processes rely on
electronic absorption:
spectroscopic methods, photo-
physical events, laser-triggered reactions, to name a few.
The design of linear or nonlinear laser processes that in-
crease the yield of electronic absorption or make it more
robust against control parameters or experimental uncer-
tainties is a key drive in the ﬁeld of Quantum Control[1–
4]. One particular family of methods that has received
considerable attention is adiabatic passage[5–7].

In adiabatic passage, population inversion between two
quantum states can be achieved independently of the
precise peak amplitude or pulse duration of the ﬁeld,
provided that the pulse area, that is, the accumulated
interaction energy (integrated over time) is suﬃciently
large. Typically, adiabatic passage can be achieved using
chirped pulses[8–11], although transformed-limited (i.e.
Gaussian) pulses can be used as well in multiphoton pro-
cesses. This is the case in the well known Stimulated
Raman Adiabatic passage or STIRAP scheme[5–7], as
well as in the strong-ﬁeld scheme of Adiabatic Passage
by Light-Induced Potentials or APLIP.[12–20].

Both STIRAP and APLIP were proposed (and in the
STIRAP case the scheme has been implemented) using
relatively long pulses, such that a single vibrational state
is clearly resolved and selected during the adiabatic tran-
sition. This makes the transition relatively slow and the
whole scheme more diﬃcult to implement in the labo-
ratory, as the coherence of the interaction must be pre-
served and other possible competing processes have to
be decoupled. This is particularly important when the
pulses are strong, as in APLIP. APLIP is a very interest-
ing and incredibly robust laser scheme which, however,
demands the use of very strong pulses, such that other
unwanted transitions (e.g. ionization) usually dominate
over the selected APLIP process. The realization of ul-
trafast adiabatic passage using femtosecond pulses would
naturally enhance the applicability of the schemes and
the likelihood of implementing APLIP in the laboratory.
However, using femtosecond pulses, such that the pro-
cess occurs during the natural time-scale of the vibra-
tional motion, poses other challenges, that were recently
recognized. A typical example is resonant one-photon

FIG. 1: Sketch of the model showing the electronic potentials.
First we study one-photon electronic absorption to the ﬁrst
(A) electronic band using femtosecond pulses tuned to the
v(cid:48) = 7 vibrational level (Franck-Condon transition). Then we
analyze non-resonant two-photon absorption to the B band
using two pulses tuned to the v(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0 vibrational level. The
pulses are either blue- or red-detuned from the A band. We
optimize the yield of absorption starting from an initial wave
packet (ψ(0)) instead of the ground vibrational level.

absorption between electronic states of molecules using
femtosecond pulses. If the pulses are not too short that
the nuclear positions are ﬁxed, and not too intense that
the potentials are completely distorted by the ﬁeld, the
absorption is highly suppressed[21, 22]. This is a generic
behavior of systems with a dense structure of couplings
(that is, without very restrictive selections rules) excited
by ﬁelds whose spectral width is larger than the energy
spacing of the levels. Then the initial quantum states
are relatively protected from resonant transitions from
other manifolds. Only very speciﬁc states allow popula-
tion transfer avoiding the decoupling between the man-
ifolds, induced by Autler-Townes splittings between the
unpopulated levels[23–25]. Such states allow fast parallel
transfer of population between the manifolds[21, 22].

In this work we will analyze what happens for

v’ = 0v = 7Bε1+ε2ψ(0)ε1XAnon-resonant two-photon transitions using strong ﬁelds,
where many assumptions used to prove the decoupling
of the electronic excitation do not operate. In particu-
lar, the potential energy surface of the molecule can be
severely deformed in the presence of the ﬁelds, gener-
ating light-induced potentials[26–29]. Then, the energy
eigenstates of the ﬁeld-free Hamiltonian are not a very
useful basis to follow the dynamics of the system. Hence,
we will study the dynamics in the position representa-
tion, solving the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
(TDSE) numerically on a grid, using the Split-operator
method[30]. As a particular example, we will analyze
one- and two-photon excitation of the A and B electronic
bands in Na2. The recently developed Geometrical Op-
timization (GeOp) scheme[31] will then be used to opti-
mize the initial state, starting in a wave packet, in order
to maximize the yield of absorption at the lowest possible
pulse intensities, using the initial vibrational coherence
to exploit parallel transfer[22].

Our goal is to understand the necessary conditions
for inversion of the electronic populations (high yields
of electronic absorption) and, secondly, for vibrational
state-selective transitions, using strong pulses of increas-
ingly shorter duration. In particular we want to under-
stand if the use of time-delayed pulse sequences which
are needed in adiabatic passage, poses an additional ad-
vantage or disadvantage with respect to the decoupling
of electronic absorption. On the other hand, even for
pulses with bandwidth smaller than the vibrational en-
ergy spacing, the population transfer can occur below the
onset of adiabaticity, reducing the yields of (selective or
overall) absorption. For such study we will analyze the
performance of APLIP with ultrashort pulses, using the
GeOp procedure.

The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows: In
section 2 we will summarize the GeOp procedure applied
to our problem and we will revisit the case of ultrafast
electronic absorption in resonant conditions. The non-
resonant case is analyzed in section 3, where we focus on
the decisive role of the pulse sequence. In section 4 we
study vibrational-state selective APLIP with ultrashort
laser pulses and section 5 is the conclusions.

II. GEOMETRICAL OPTIMIZATION

As a numerical example, we will study one- and two-
photon absorption in Na2, between the X, A and B
states, shown in Fig.1. Throughout this work we will
assume the Condon limit, µXA(r) = µAB(r) = 1. Here
we review the application of the GeOp procedure[31],
applied to wave packet calculations. Using the Born-
Oppenheimer approximation, we will follow the dynam-
ics of nuclear wave packets ψX,A,B, starting in Ψ(0) =
(ψ0
X , 0, 0), the system ground state. We will use the up-
per case notation (Ψ) for the three-component (vector)
nuclear wave function. To simplify the notation, when-
ever there is only one component diﬀerent from zero (or if

when we start from a wave packet with Nc components (vi-
brational levels) instead of a single level. The amplitudes and
phases of such wave packet are found by GeOp.

X = (ψ0

we are only interested in a single component) we will use
the same subscripts for the full wave functions as for the
components, Ψ0
X , 0, 0), if no confusion is possible.
Formally, the solution of the TDSE can be written as
Ψ(T ) = U(T, 0;E(t))Ψ(0), where U is the time evolution
operator. In the simplest GeOp procedure, we maximize
the yield of the process for a ﬁxed pulse E(t) optimizing
the initial wave function, Ψopt(0) = (ψopt
X , 0, 0) = Ψopt
with restrictions. Typically we require it to be a superpo-
sition of a small number of vibrational eigenstates of the
ground electronic state ψopt
X . Maximizing
the overall yield of absorption χ to e.g. the ﬁrst elec-
tronic band A, requires ﬁnding the highest eigenvalue of
the reduced yield operator Fred[31], with matrix elements

Although we are interested in two-photon processes,
for consistency, Fig.2 shows the results of the maximum
eigenvalue (optimal yield) for the electronic absorption to
the A state using a 650 nm 40 fs full-width half-maximum
(fwhm) Gaussian pulse as a function of the peak ampli-
tude, when the initial state can be a superposition of
the ﬁrst Nc vibrational eigenstates of the ground poten-
tial.
(With Nc = 1 the dynamics is not optimized.)
For the chosen frequency the laser is resonant to the
v = 7 ← v(cid:48) = 0 transition, but ∼ 8 vibrational lev-
els can participate in the dynamics. These results are
similar to those previously obtained[21, 22] but we are
now using wave packet calculations and assume the Con-
don limit. As expected, the available (within the pulse
bandwidth) initially unpopulated vibrational states in-
duce the decoupling between the electronic states. The
absorption yield however can be ramped up by optimiz-
ing the initial state using its vibrational coherences, with

fact is that the optimization supersedes the pulse area
theorem[7], such that the characteristic Rabi oscillations
can be dumped. Obviously the solution is not robust in
the adiabatic sense. For each pulse intensity a diﬀerent
optimal wave function must be found.

We have shown that for very long pulses the GeOp pro-
cedure cannot yield much better results. On the other
hand, for very short pulses GeOp is also not needed. If
the pulse duration τ is so short that there is no vibra-
tional motion involved in the transition, then ψA(τ ) ≈
ψX (0). Since the ψj
X (for diﬀerent j) are orthogonal,
the matrix Fred is practically diagonal, that is, the ini-
tial state (and in fact, whatever vibrational eigenstate)
decouples the Raman transition and hence avoids the
Autler-Townes eﬀect on the electronic absorption. This
is the regime where we can speak of vertical transitions.

III. NON-RESONANT TWO-PHOTON

EXCITATION

We now turn our attention to non-resonant two-photon
excitation of the B state. Fig.3 show the results for dif-
ferent pulse sequences using 40 fs fwhm Gaussian pulses.
The frequencies of the pulses are chosen such that the
ﬁrst transition is red-detuned with respect to the reso-
nant excitation of the A band, using 868 nm and 710 nm
pulses. The dynamics is solved using the rotating wave
approximation[7, 29], although for large intensities the
approximation is not really valid. In addition, the prob-
ability of ionization is neglected. Here we are interested
in the qualitative aspects of the process.

Consider ﬁrst two-photon absorption using coincident
pulses, shown in Fig.3(a). As in the results for the one-
photon resonant transition, the yield of absorption is
dumped by Rabi oscillations, and it can again be im-
proved by using the vibrational coherences optimizing
the initial state. The main diﬀerence with respect to the
results shown in Fig.2 is that the Rabi oscillations are
faster, since the eﬀective coupling (the Rabi frequency)
depends with the square of the ﬁeld amplitude, that is,
with the ﬁeld intensity. On the other hand the eﬀect of
the vibrational coherence is quite noteworthy and opti-
mizing the amplitudes and phases of the ﬁrst three vibra-
tional components is typically enough to achieve almost
full population inversion.

However, the dynamics is completely diﬀerent when
we use time-delayed pulse sequences. For the results in
Fig.3(b) and (c) the time-delay is set to 20 fs. In Fig.3(b)
the pulse coupling the X and A electronic states, E1(t),
precedes the pulse coupling the A and B states, E2(t),
whereas for the results in Fig.3(c) the opposite order,
with E2(t) preceding E1(t) is chosen. The ﬁrst pulse se-
quences is sometimes called in intuitive order while the
second is considered counter-intuitive. Interestingly, the
dynamics proceeds now adiabatically and there are no
Rabi oscillations (or very attenuated) in both pulse se-

FIG. 3: Yield of absorption in the B band as a function of
the peak amplitude of the two 40 fs laser pulses. In (a) we
use coincident pulses, in (b) and (c) the second pulse is 20 fs
delayed with respect to the ﬁrst pulse. The ﬁrst pulse is red-
detuned from the A band to avoid its excitation. In (c) the
dotted lines correspond to choosing ω1 detuned to the blue
of the A band. The yield increases when the initial state is
an optimized wave packet with Nc components (vibrational
levels) instead of a single level. However, for the time-delayed
sequences the eﬀect is small and mainly reduces the laser-
intensity threshold at which population inversion occurs.

quences. The time-delayed pulses exert an eﬀect similar
to an eﬀective chirp, facilitating the adiabatic passage
of the population, regardless of the dynamic decoupling
induced by the initially unpopulated levels within the
pulse bandwidth. The transition, however, is not state-
selective. The initial state can be optimized accelerating
the onset of full adiabatic passage, that is, the eﬀective
Rabi frequency becomes larger when the appropriate vi-
brational coherences are used.

Regarding the order of the sequence, the adiabaticity
is better preserved using the intuitive sequence. How-
ever, this is due to the choice of pulse frequencies. It is
well known that adiabatic passage can proceed through a
light-induced potential using a counter-intuitive sequence
if the frequencies are chosen such that ω1 is tuned to the
blue of the ﬁrst electronic band. This is the basis of
the APLIP process. In Fig.3(c) we show the results for
this case (dotted lines), using pulses of 566 and 1259 nm
wavelengths (for λ1 and λ2, respectively).

with respect to the total time propagation T .

IV. TOWARD ULTRAFAST SELECTIVE APLIP

We have shown that two-photon transitions with time-
delayed pulses and in particular APLIP are intrinsically
protected against Autler-Townes decoupling. We have
optimized the initial state preparing particular superpo-
sitions of vibrational levels to accelerate the onset of the
adiabatic passage. However, the transition is not state-
selective. Can we use the GeOp procedure to achieve
ultrafast selective APLIP?

In Fig.4 we show the yield of selective excitation of the
Ψ0
B state using the GeOp method [Eq.(2)] with pulses
of increasing duration using the APLIP pulse sequence
with peak ﬁeld amplitudes E0 = 0.01 a.u. and the previ-
ous wavelengths. The time-delay is set as half the fwhm.
Using pulses longer than 1 ps the APLIP scheme is se-
lective. Although for all cases considered here there is
electronic population inversion, excited vibrational lev-
els are increasingly populated using shorter pulses. For
durations of 100 fs the selective yield is practically zero.
However, starting in optimized superpositions states one
can recover the full state-selective population transfer.
The number of vibrational levels of the X electronic state
that must be included in the optimal initial wave function
must increase as the pulses become shorter.

In order to understand the optimization mechanism
one must consider the source of adiabaticity in the trans-
fer. In APLIP the initial wave function is propagated on
a light-induced potential (LIP) that connects the ground
state with the second excited electronic state. During the
process the wave packet must remain in the bottom of the
LIP, that is, it must be the ground vibrational instanta-
neous eigenstate of the LIP. This requires the process to
be quasi-static. Changes in the LIP must be done so
slow as to allow the wave function to adapt, in a Born-
Oppenheimer way. If the pulses are short, the changes
in the LIP impart a momentum on the wave function
inducing vibrational excitation.
In Fig.5 we show the
evolution of the average momentum of the system wave

ing the initial state (dashed lines) and for the optimal initial

function (cid:104)Ψ(t)|p|Ψ(cid:105) ≡ (cid:104)p(t)(cid:105). The selective transfer can
only be regained when the initial wave packet has an ini-
tial (opposite) momentum (cid:104)p(0)(cid:105) that compensates the
eﬀect of the ﬁeld on the wave function.

The time-symmetry that is apparent in Fig.5 can also
be observed in the dynamics in the position representa-
tion shown in Fig.6, where we use 100 fs (fwhm) pulses
with E0 = 0.01 a.u. Allowing for enough vibrational
states in the initial optimized wave function, the GeOp
procedure essentially provides the same initial solution
as that obtained by propagating backwards in time the
target wave function, Ψopt

V. CONCLUSIONS

The vibrational coherence plays an important role in
accelerating electronic absorption. Hence, preparing an
initial wave packet opens the gate to new schemes of

In this work we
use the recently proposed GeOp procedure to obtain
the optimal parameters of the initial wave packet. This
is essential in resonant one-photon transitions, as the
Autler-Townes splittings considerably reduce the yield
of absorption. However, by using time-delayed pulse se-
quences the yield of non-resonant two-photon absorption
is already protected from the Autler-Townes splittings.
Time-delayed pulse sequences possess an inherent robust-
ness that make two-photon transitions particularly inter-
esting for quantum control of population transfer. How-
ever, an initial wave packet can still be used to reduce
the onset of adiabatic passage, making population inver-
sion possible with weaker or shorter ﬁelds, which pose
additional advantages to the experimental implementa-
tion of such schemes. This is particularly the case in
APLIP. We have shown that one can prepare ultrafast-

5

APLIP scenarios with ultrashort pulses and moreover,
the APLIP process can be state-selective provided that
the initial wave packet overlaps a suﬃciently large num-
ber of vibrational levels.
