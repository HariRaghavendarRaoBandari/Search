Abstract

Given a ﬁnite point set P ⊂ Rd, we call a multiset A a one-sided weak ε-approximant for P

(with respect to convex sets), if |P ∩ C|/|P | − |A ∩ C|/|A| ≤ ε for every convex set C.

We show that, in contrast with the usual (two-sided) weak ε-approximants, for every set P ⊂ Rd

there exists a one-sided weak ε-approximant of size bounded by a function of ε and d.

Introduction

A common theme in mathematics is approximation of large, complicated objects by smaller, simpler
objects. This paper proposes a new notion of approximation in combinatorial geometry, which we call
one-sided ε-approximants. It is a notion of approximation that is in strength between ε-approximants
and ε-nets. We recall these two notions ﬁrst.
Let P ⊂ Rd be a ﬁnite set, and F ⊂ 2Rd

a family of sets in Rd. In applications, the family F is
usually a geometrically natural family, such as the family of all halfspaces, the family of all simplices,
or the family of all convex sets. A ﬁnite set A ⊂ Rd is called an ε-approximant for P with respect to
F if

|P |

|A|

for all C ∈ F.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ ε

The notion of an ε-approximant was introduced by Vapnik and Chervonenkis [V ˇC71] in the context of
statistical learning theory. They associated to each family F a number VC-dim(F) ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . . , ∞},
which has become known as VC dimension, and proved that if VC-dim(F) < ∞, then every set P
admits an ε-approximant A of size |A| ≤ CVC-dim(F )ε−2, a bound which does not depend on the size
of P . The ε-approximants that they constructed had the additional property that A ⊂ P . Following
tradition, we say that A is a strong ε-approximant if A ⊂ P . The bound has been improved to

|A| ≤ CVC-dim(F )ε−2+2/(VC-dim(F )+1) (see [Mat95, Theorem 1.2] and [Mat99, Exercise 5.2.7]) which is
optimal [Ale90].

In a geometric context, Haussler and Welzl [HW87] introduced ε-nets. With P and F as above,

a set N is called an ε-net for P with respect to F if

|C ∩ P |

|P |

> ε =⇒ C ∩ N 6= ∅

for all C ∈ F.

An ε-approximant is an ε-net, but not conversely. While an ε-net is a weaker notion of approx-
imation,
its advantage over an ε-approximant is that every set P admits an ε-net of size only
CVC-dim(F )ε−1 log ε−1, which is smaller than the bound for the ε-approximants. The ε-nets con-
structed by Haussler and Welzl are also strong, i.e., they satisfy N ⊂ P .

Most geometrically important families F have a bounded VC dimension. A notable exception is
the family Fconv of all convex sets. Indeed, it is easy to see that a set of n points in convex position
does not admit any strong ε-net of size smaller than (1 − ε)n with respect to Fconv. Alon, B´ar´any
F¨uredi, and Kleitman [ABFK92] showed that for every P ⊂ Rd there exists a (weak) ε-net of size
bounded solely by a function of ε and d. No extension of their result to ε-approximants is possible.

Proposition 1. If P ⊂ R2 is a set of n points in convex position, then every ε-approximant with
respect to Fconv has size at least n( 1

4 − ε/2).

Proof. Let p1, p . . . , pn be the enumeration of the vertices of P in clockwise order along the convex
hull of P . For i = 1, . . . , ⌊(n − 1)/2⌋ write Ti for the triangle p2i−1, p2i, p2i+1. Suppose A ⊂ R2 is
an ε-approximant for P . Let I def= {i : Ti ∩ A = ∅}. Note that |I| ≥ n/2 − 2|A| − 1 since each
point of A lies in at most two triangles. Deﬁne S def= {p1, p3, p5, . . . } to be the odd-numbered points,
and let S′ def= S ∪ {p2i : i ∈ I}. Let C def= conv S and C ′ def= conv S′. Then C ∩ A = C ′ ∩ A, but
|C ′ ∩ P |/|P | − |C ∩ P |/|P | = |I|/|P | > ε if |A| < |P |( 1

4 − ε/2).

In light of Proposition 1, we introduce a new concept. A multiset1 A is a one-sided ε-approximant

for P with respect to the family F if

|C ∩ P |

|P |

−

|C ∩ A|

|A|

≤ ε

for all C ∈ F.

In other words, if C ∈ F, then C might contain many more points of A than expected, but never
much fewer. It is clear that an ε-approximant is a one-sided ε-approximant, and that a one-sided
ε-approximant is an ε-net.

Our main result shows that allowing one-sided errors is enough to sidestep the pessimistic Propo-

sition 1.

Theorem 2. Let P ⊂ Rd be a ﬁnite set, and let ε ∈ (0, 1] be a real number. Then P admits a
one-sided ε-approximant with respect to Fconv of size at most g(ε, d), for some g that depends only on
ε and on d.

1In this paper we allow A to be a multiset. While the results of this paper continue to hold if we require A to be a

set, the proofs become more technical. We sketch the necessary changes in the ﬁnal section.

Unfortunately, due to the use of a geometric Ramsey theorem, our bound on g is very weak:

for some constant c > 1 that depends only on d, where the tower function is given by tw1(x) def= x and
twi+1

def= 2twi(x). We believe this bound to be very far from sharp.

g(ε, d) ≤ twd(cid:0)ε−c(cid:1)

In the rest of the paper we omit the words “with respect to Fconv” when referring to one-sided

approximants.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we recall some basic geometric deﬁnitions, and
collect some auxiliary results. In Section 3 we recall a simple bound on hypergraph Tur´an numbers.
The proof of Theorem 2 is contained in Sections 4 and 5 — the two sections contain combinatorial
and geometric parts of the argument respectively. The paper concludes with several remarks and
open problems.

2 Geometric preliminaries

The convex hull of a point set P is denoted conv P , and its aﬃne hull is denoted ahull P .

Tverberg’s theorem (see, e.g., [Mat02, p. 200]) asserts any set Q ⊂ Rd of (s − 1)(d + 1) + 1
points can be partitioned into s pairwise disjoint subsets whose convex hulls intersect. We denote by
Tvers(Q) an arbitrary point in such an intersection. A special case of Tverberg’s theorem is the case
s = 2, which is due to Radon [Rad21]. In that case, if Q is in general position (no d + 1 points are
aﬃnely dependent), then the partition is unique and Tver2(Q) is also unique.

A (geometric) predicate of arity k is a property that a k-tuple of points p1, . . . , pk might or might
not satisfy. A predicate is semialgebraic if it is a Boolean combination of expressions of the form
f (p1, . . . , pk) ≥ 0, where the f ’s are polynomials. Predicates that depend on the sign of a single
polynomial are especially useful, we call then polynomial predicates. For brevity we will identify
polynomial predicates with the underlying polynomials.

An important polynomial predicate is the orientation of a (d + 1)-tuple of points in Rd. The

orientation of p0, . . . , pd ∈ Rd is the polynomial

orient(p0, . . . , pd) def= det"p0

1

· · ·
· · ·

pd

1# .

We have orient(p0, . . . , pd) = 0 if and only if the points are aﬃnely dependent.

2.1 Orientation-homogeneous sequences

We will call a sequence of points in Rd orientation-homogeneous if all its (d + 1)-tuples have the
same nonzero orientation. It is well known that every orientation-homogeneous sequence is in convex
position, and that the convex hull of such a sequence is combinatorially equivalent to a cyclic polytope
(see, e.g., [Zie95] for background).

3

Let P = (p1, . . . , pn) be an orientation-homogeneous sequence. For a set I = {i1 < · · · < im},
def= (pi1, . . . , pim). If |I| = d, then the d points PI span
deﬁne the subsequence of P indexed by I by PI
def= ahull PI in Rd. It is simple to tell to which side of HI a point pj ∈ P \ PI belongs:
a hyperplane HI
The index set I partitions [n] \ I into d + 1 intervals (some of which might be empty). The side of HI
to which pj belongs depends only on the parity of the interval number to which pj belongs. In other
words, pj is on one side if j ∈ (−∞, i1) ∪ (i2, i3) ∪ · · · , and on the other side if j ∈ (i1, i2) ∪ (i3, i4) ∪ · · · .
Hence, two points pj and pj′ with j < j′ lie on the same side of HI if and only if [j, j′] ∩ I is of even
size.

Of particular interest to us are sets I of size d + 2. We deﬁne, for such a set I = {i1 < i2 < · · · <

id+2}, a partition I = Iodd ∪ Ieven, where Iodd

def= {i1, i3, . . . } and Ieven

def= {i2, i4, . . . }.

Lemma 3. If P is orientation-homogeneous and |I| = d + 2, then the convex sets conv PIodd and
conv PIeven intersect.

Proof. Indeed, suppose they are disjoint, and hence there exists a hyperplane H that separates PIodd
from PIeven . Then H can be perturbed into a hyperplane H ′ that goes through some d points of PI ,
i.e., H ′ = HJ for some J ⊂ I, |J| = d. The set PI\J consists of two points, say pi, pi′ with i < i′, and
they belong to the same part of the partition P = PIodd ∪ PIeven precisely when [i, i′] ∩ J is of odd
size. This is in contradiction with the criterion for HJ to separate pi from pi′.

By Ramsey’s theorem, there is a number OTd(n) such that each sequence of OTd(n) points in
general position contains an orientation-homogeneous subsequence of length n. The growth rate of
OTd(n) is known quite precisely: For all d ≥ 2 we have twd(c′
dn) ≤ OTd(n) ≤ twd(cdn) for positive
constants c′
d < cd. The upper bound is due to Suk [Suk14], and the lower bound is due to Eli´aˇs,
Matouˇsek, Rold´an-Pensado and Safernov´a [EMRPS14].

2.2 Point selection

The following lemma is a minor variation on Lemma 2.2 from [AKN+08]:

Lemma 4. Let s def= ⌊d/2⌋+1, and let D def= (s−1)(d+1)+1. Let (p1, p2, . . . , p2D+1) be an orientation-
homogeneous sequence of 2D + 1 points in Rd. Let Q = {p2, p4, . . . , p2D} and R = {p1, p3, . . . , p2D+1}
(so |Q| = D and |R| = D + 1). Then Tvers(Q) ∈ conv(R).

Proof. Let x def= Tvers(Q). If x /∈ conv(R), then there exists a hyperplane H separating x from R.
There must be at least s points of Q on the same side of H as x (at least one from each part in the
Tverberg partition). Let Q′ be any s of these points. Pick any set R′ ⊂ R of ⌈d/2⌉ + 1 points that
interleaves Q′. By Lemma 3, the sets conv(Q′) and conv(R′) intersect, contradicting the fact that
that H separates Q′ from R.

2.3 A regularity lemma for semialgebraic predicates

We shall use a regularity lemma of Fox–Pach–Suk [FPS15], which is a quantitative improvement over
the prior version due to Fox–Gromov–Laﬀorgue–Naor–Pach [FGL+12]. The improvement is due to
the use of the eﬃcient cuttings of Chazelle–Friedman [CF90] and Clarkson [Cla88].

Consider a polynomial f ∈ R[~x1, . . . , ~xk], where each ~xi is a vector of d indeterminates. The degree
of f in ~xi is the degree of f as a polynomial in ~xi while regarding ~xj for i 6= j as constants. We say
that f is of complexity at most D if it is of degree at most D in each of ~x1, . . . , ~xk.

Lemma 5 (Theorem 1.3 in [FPS15]). For any k, d, t, D ∈ N there exists a constant c = c(k, d, t, D) > 0
with the following property. Let 0 < γ < 1/2, let P ⊂ Rd be a ﬁnite multiset, and let f1, . . . , ft ∈
R[~x1, . . . , ~xk] be t polynomials of complexity at most D each. Then there exists a partition P =
P1 ∪ · · · ∪ PM of P into at most M ≤ (1/γ)c parts, and a small set E ⊂ [M ]k of “exceptional”
k-tuples, satisfying the following:

1. The exceptions are few: E ≤ γM k,

2. Almost all k-tuples are regular: whenever (i1, . . . , ik) /∈ E and p1 ∈ Pi1 , . . . , pk ∈ Pik , then the

sign of

fj(p1, . . . , pk)

depends only on j and on the tuple (i1, . . . , ik) but not on the actual choice of the points
p1, . . . , pk. (Note that the elements i1, . . . , ik of the tuple need not be distinct nor in increasing
order.)

3. The partition is an equipartition: For all i, j the cardinalities of Pi and of Pj diﬀer by at most

one.

(The statement appearing in [FPS15] is slightly diﬀerent: In part (2) instead of claiming that
the signs of all fj are constant, the original merely states that an arbitrary ﬁxed Boolean formula
in signs of fj is constant. However, their proof actually establishes the stronger statement above.
Alternatively, one may reﬁne the partition P by iterative application of the original statement to each
fj in turn. The only minor drawback is that instead of a true equipartition one would then obtain a
partition whose parts diﬀer by as much as t, the number of polynomials.)

The main point of Lemma 5 is that the number M of parts is independent of |P | (otherwise we
could trivially partition P into parts of size 1). The price for this independence is the small set E
which indexes “irregular” tuples.

Invoking Lemma 5 with the orientation predicate, we obtain the following result, which is what

we actually need:

Corollary 6. For each d there exists a constant c = c(d) > 0 with the following property. Let
0 < γ < 1/2, and let P ⊂ Rd be a ﬁnite point set in general position. Then there exists a partition

P = P1 ∪ · · · ∪ PM of P into M parts, with 1/γ ≤ M ≤ 2(1/γ)c, and a small hypergraph H ⊂(cid:0)[M ]
d+1(cid:1)

of “exceptional” (d + 1)-sets, satisfying the following:

5

d+1(cid:1),
1. |H| ≤ γ(cid:0) M
2. Whenever {i0, i1, . . . , id} ∈ (cid:0)[M ]

d+1(cid:1) \ H and p0 ∈ Pi0 , p1 ∈ Pi1, . . . , pd ∈ Pid, then the sign of

orient(p0, p1, . . . , pd) depends only on the tuple (i0, . . . , id) but not on the actual choice of the
points p0, . . . , pd. (The sign of orient obviously does depend on the permutation of the elements
i0, . . . , id.)

3. For all i, j the cardinalities of Pi and of Pj diﬀer by at most one.

Proof. If |P | ≤ 2(1/γ)c, then simply partition P into parts of size 1. So, assume |P | ≥ 2(1/γ)c. We
def= orient. We obtain a partition of P into M ≤ (1/γ)c parts, each
apply Lemma 5 with t def= 1 and f1
of size at least 2, and a set E ⊂ [M ]d+1 of size at most γM d+1.

We now show that all tuples (i0, . . . , id) ∈ [M ]d+1 that contain repeated elements must belong to
E. Indeed, consider one such tuple, and say ij = ij′. Since the part Pij has at least two elements, say
p and q, swapping p and q causes orient to ﬂip its nonzero sign (recall that P is in general position).
Hence, the tuple (i0, . . . , id) is not regular.

This consideration implies the lower bound for M : We have γM d+1 ≥ |E| ≥ M d+1−(d+1)!(cid:0) M

M d+1 − M d(M − 1) = M d, and hence M ≥ 1/γ.

d+1(cid:1) ≥

Finally, we let H consist of all tuples in E whose elements are pairwise distinct (this deﬁnition
makes sense since, in our case, E is invariant under permutations). Since E contains all the tuples
with repeated elements, it can contain at most a γ-fraction of the remaining tuples. Therefore, the
same is true for H.

3

Independent sets in hypergraphs

We will also need the following bound on hypergraph Tur´an numbers. We give a simple probabilistic
proof based on [AS00, Theorem 3.2.1], though a stronger bound can be found in [dC83].

Lemma 7. Let r ≥ 2, and suppose H is an r-uniform hypergraph on n vertices with βnr edges, where
n ≥ 1

2 β−1/(r−1). Then H contains an independent set on at least 1

4 β−1/(r−1) vertices.

Proof. Let p def= β−1/(r−1)/(2n). Note that p ≤ 1 by the assumption on n. Let S ⊆ V (H) be a random
set where Pr[v ∈ S] = p for each v ∈ V (H) independently. Then the expected number of edges spanned
by S is prβnr. For each edge in S we may remove one vertex to obtain an independent set. Hence, H
contains an independent set of size at least E[I] = pn − prβnr ≥ 1

2 β−1/(r−1) − 1

2r β1−r/(r−1)/nr · nr.

4

Interval chains

We will reduce the geometric problem of constructing one-sided ε-approximants to a combinatorial
problem about interval chains. Let [i, j] denote the interval of integers {i, i + 1, . . . , j}. We still write

6

[t] for {1, 2, . . . , t}. An interval chain of size k (also called k-chain) is a sequence of k consecutive,
disjoint, nonempty intervals

I def= [a1, a2 − 1][a2, a3 − 1] · · · [ak, ak+1 − 1],

where 1 ≤ a1 < a2 < · · · < aD+1 ≤ t + 1. Interval chains were introduced by Condon and Saks [CS04].
They were subsequently used by Alon, Kaplan, Nivasch, Sharir and Smorodinsky [AKN+08] and by
Bukh, Matouˇsek, Nivasch [BMN11] to obtain bounds for weak ε-nets for orientation-homogeneous
point sets.

A D-tuple of integers (x1, . . . xD) is said to stab a k-chain I if each xi lies in a diﬀerent interval

of I.

The problem considered in [AKN+08] was to build, for given D, k, and t, a small-sized family F
of D-tuples that stab all k-chains in [t]. Phrased diﬀerently, for each interval chain I with at least k
intervals, there should be at least one D-tuple in F that stabs I.

In contrast, here we will consider the following problem: Given D, ε, and t, we want to build
a small-sized family (multiset) F of D-tuples such that, for each interval chain I in [t], if αt is the
number of intervals in I, then at least an (α − ε)-fraction of the D-tuples in F stab I. We call such
an F an ε-approximating family.

Our construction of ε-approximating families is similar to the statement of the regularity lemma for
words, due to Axenovich, Person and Puzynina [APP13]. The lemma, which was also independently
discovered by Feige, Koren and Tennenholtz [FKT14] under the name of ‘local repetition lemma’,
can be used directly to construct ε-approximating families. Doing so yields a family whose size is
exponential in 1/ε. In contrast, we avoid using the full strength of the regularity lemma and obtain
a construction of polynomial size.

Lemma 8. Suppose D ≥ 2 and 0 < ε < 1. Let K def= ⌈D ln(2/ε)⌉ and t def= m(D − 1)K for some integer
m ≥ 4/ε. Then there exists an ε-approximating family F of D-tuples in [t], of size |F| ≤ DDε−D ln Dt.

Proof. The argument is more conveniently phrased in the “dual” setting, in which D-tuples become
(D − 1)-interval chains and ℓ-interval chains become (ℓ + 1)-tuples in the natural way. Then a (D − 1)-
chain C “stabs” a tuple T if T contains points on both sides of C, as was as inside each interval of
C.

For each k = 0, 1, . . . , K − 1, we partition [t] into disjoint intervals of length (D − 1)k, by letting

Bk,i
disjoint (D − 1)-chains, by letting

def= (cid:2)(i − 1)(D − 1)k + 1, i(D − 1)k(cid:3) for 1 ≤ i ≤ t/(D − 1)k. Then we group these intervals into

Fk

def= {Bk,i(D−1)+1 · · · Bk,(i+1)(D−1) : 1 ≤ i ≤ t/(D − 1)k+1}.

We call each Fk a layer. Note that each chain in Fk ﬁts exactly in an interval of layer k + 1.
Then we deﬁne the multiset F by taking wk copies of Fk for each 0 ≤ k ≤ K − 1, where

wk

def= DK−k−1(D − 1)2k+1.

7

Hence, letting W def= DK−1t, E def= (D−1)/D, we have |F| =PK−1

by the choice of K,

W (D − 1) < |F| < W D ≤ DDε−D ln Dt.

k=0 wk|Fk| = W D(1−EK). Therefore,

Let J be a subset of [t], and let αt be the size of J. We claim that at least an (α − ε)-fraction of

the chains in F stab J.

Call a (D−1)-chain C ∈ F empty if J does not intersect any interval of C, and occupied otherwise.
If C is occupied, then call it fully occupied if J intersects all intervals of C, and partially occupied
otherwise.

For each 0 ≤ k ≤ K − 1, let βk denote the fraction of chains of Fk that are occupied by J, and

let γk ≤ βk denote the fraction of chains of Fk that are partially occupied by J.

Claim 1. For each k we have βk ≥ α + (γ0 + · · · + γk)/(D − 1).

j be the set of occupied chains of Fj, and let F ′′

j covers a γj-fraction of [t]. From each chain C ∈ F ′′

Proof. For each layer j, Let F ′
j be the set of those
that are only partially occupied. Hence, F ′′
j choose
an empty interval, and let Bj be the union of these empty intervals. Hence, Bj covers a (γj/(D − 1))-
fraction of [t]. Furthermore, since each chain in F ′′
j contains a point of J, the sets B0, . . . , Bk must be
pairwise disjoint, as well as disjoint from J, and their union U def= B0 ∪ · · · Bk ∪ J must be completely
contained in the union of F ′
[t], and the claim follows.

k covers at least an(cid:0)α + (γ0 + · · · + γk)/(D − 1)(cid:1)-fraction of

k. Hence, F ′

j ⊂ F ′

Let us now derive a lower bound on the number of fully occupied chains in F. By some tedious

calculations we obtain:

(βk − γk)wk|Fk| ≥

where the upper bound forP γk was obtained from Claim 1.

Finally, note that in each layer Fk there are at most two fully occupied chains that do not stab

J. Since |Fk| ≥ m ≥ 4/ε, the said chains constitute at most an (ε/2)-fraction of F.

5 Construction of the one-sided approximants

In this section we prove Theorem 2.

Let s and D be as in Lemma 4. Then let t be as small as possible to satisfy the condition of

Lemma 8 with ε/2 in place of ε (so t is polynomial in 1/ε). Then deﬁne

u def= ⌈4/ε⌉,

n0

def= tu,

N def= OTd(n0),

β def= (4N )−d,

γ def= β(ε/5)d+1;

(1)

where the function OTd(n0) is deﬁned at the end of Section 2.1. Invoking Lemma 8, let F be an
(ε/2)-approximating family of D-tuples in [t], of size F ≤ DD(2/ε)D ln Dt.

Let P ⊂ Rd be a given ﬁnite point set, and let n def= |P |. We will construct a one-sided ε-approx-
imant multiset A for P . If n ≤ 40/(εγc) for the constant c of Corollary 6, then simply let A def= P .
Hence, assume n ≥ 40/(εγc). In this case, our multiset A will consist of Tverberg points of certain
D-tuples of points of P .

We start by invoking Corollary 6 on P and the parameter γ given in (1). We obtain a partition
of P into 1/γ ≤ M ≤ 2(1/γ)c almost-equal-sized parts P1, . . . , PM , and a corresponding hypergraph

H ⊆(cid:0)[M ]

d+1(cid:1) of size |H| ≤ γ(cid:0) M
d+1(cid:1).

We make all parts have exactly the same size by discarding at most one point from each part.
Hence we discard at most M ≤ 2(1/γ)c points. Since n ≥ 40/(εγc), we discarded at most an (ε/20)-
fraction of the points of P . By a slight abuse of notation, we denote the new parts by the same
names P1, . . . , PM . We will consider P1, . . . , PM as an ordered sequence (where the order was chosen
arbitrarily).

from the parts. We will now repeatedly “ﬁsh out” equal-length orientation-homogeneous subsequences

Let bP = (p1, . . . , pM ), where pi ∈ Pi for all i, be an arbitrarily chosen sequence of representatives
from bP , until there are too few points left to continue the process. For this purpose, let bP1
def= bP , and
let i ← 1. Repeat the following: If(cid:12)(cid:12)bPi(cid:12)(cid:12) < εM/5 then stop. Otherwise, bPi is large enough so that the
number of edges of H spanned by bPi is at most

|H| ≤ γ(cid:18) M

d + 1(cid:19) ≤ γM d+1 = β(εM/5)d+1 ≤ β(cid:12)(cid:12)bPi(cid:12)(cid:12)d+1.

increase i by 1, and return to the beginning of the loop.

In view of M ≥ 1/γ, we also have εM/5 ≥ (5/ε)d/β ≥ 1

2 β−1/d. Hence, we can apply Lemma 7 on bPi
with r = d + 1. We conclude that bPi has an independent set of size N . By the deﬁnition of N , that
def= bPi \ Si,
independent set has an orientation-homogeneous subsequence Si of length n0. Let bPi+1
m ≤ M/n0, and a leftover sequence S∗ def= bPm+1 of size at most εM/5. From each Si we will now

At the end of this process, we get orientation-homogeneous sequences S1, S2, . . . , Sm for some

construct a multiset Ai of Tverberg points; their union will be our desired multiset A.

So ﬁx i, and denote Si = (q0, q1, q2, . . . , qn0−1). Let vj

def= (v1, . . . , vt). For each j = 1, . . . , t, deﬁne the block bj

def= q(j−1)u for all 1 ≤ j ≤ t. We will
def=

call the elements vj separators. Let v

(q(j−1)u+1, . . . , qju−1), which contains the elements of Si between separators vj and vj+1. Let

Bj

def= [pk∈bj

Pk

be the union of all the parts that correspond to points of block bj.

To each D-tuple x = (x1, . . . , xD) ∈ F, associate the D-tuple of separators Qx

def= {vx1, . . . , vxD }.

Then deﬁne the multiset

Ai

def= {Tvers(Qx) : x ∈ F}.

Lemma 9. Let C ⊆ Rd be a convex set. Take the set of indices J def= {j : Bj ∩ C 6= ∅}. List the
elements of J in increasing order as J = {j1, j2 . . . , jℓ}. Let I be the (ℓ − 1)-interval chain:

I def= [j1 + 1, j2][j2 + 1, j3] · · · [jℓ−1 + 1, jℓ].

Then, if the D-tuple x ∈ F stabs I, then C contains the corresponding Tverberg point Tvers(Qx).

q < · · · < xD ≤ j′

Proof. Suppose x = (x1, . . . , xD) stabs I. Then there exists a subset J ′ def= (j′
D) ⊂ J such that
0 < x1 ≤ j′

D. For each j ∈ J there is a part P (j) whose representative point
p(j) belongs to the block bj, and such that C contains some point p′(j) ∈ P (j). The sequence of
representatives p(j′
D), being a subsequence of Si, is orientation-homogeneous.
Therefore, by regularity, and since Si avoids the hypergraph H, the sequence p′(j′
1), . . . ,
vxD , p′(j′

D) is also orientation-homogeneous. Therefore, by Lemma 4, we have

as desired.

def=Spj∈Si

Let Si

Pj be the union of all the parts whose representative points belong to Si.

Corollary 10. Let C ⊆ Rd be a convex set, and let α be the fraction of the points of Si contained
in C. Then C contains at least an (α − 3ε/4)-fraction of the points of Ai.

Proof. Since |v| = t ≤ εn0/4, and since all the parts P1, . . . , PM have equal size, the set C meets at
least an (α − ε/4)-fraction of the sets Bj. The desired conclusion follows from Lemma 9 since F is
(ε/2)-approximating.

Finally, let

A def=

With some patience, we can use (1) and the bound OTd(n) ≤ twd(cdn) mentioned above to obtain

Note that at most (ε/20)n+(ε/5)n = εn/4 points of P were either discarded in making P1, . . . , PM

α-fraction of the points of P , and an αi-fraction of the points of Si for each i, then avgi αi ≥ α − ε/4.

By Corollary 10, C contains at least an (αi − 3ε/4)-fraction of the points of Ai. Hence, averaging

again, C contains an (α − ε)-fraction of the points of A.

This concludes the proof of Theorem 2 for the case when P is in general position.

If P = {p1, . . . , pn} is not in general position, take an arbitrarily small continuous perturbation
P (t) def= {p1(t), . . . , pn(t)} such that P (0) = P and P (t) is in general position for all 0 < t ≤ 1. For

each t > 0 we apply the above argument on P (t); we get a family I(t) ⊂(cid:0) [n]

A(t) def= {Tvers(P (t)I ) : I ∈ I(t)} is a one-sided ε-approximant for P (t). Since P is ﬁnite, there are
only a ﬁnitely many possible values for I(t), so one of them occurs inﬁnitely often for t = t1, t2, t3, . . .
with lim ti = 0. Then, by a standard argument, the limit multiset limi→∞ A(ti) exists and is a
one-sided ε-approximant for P .

6 Problems and remarks

• The main problem is to prove reasonable upper bounds on g(ε, d). The only known lower bound
on g(ε, d) is of the form cd(1/ε) logd−1(1/ε). It is a consequence of the lower bounds on the size
of weak ε-nets [BMN11] and the fact that every one-sided ε-approximant is an ε-net.

• Much smaller one-sided approximants can be constructed if P is orientation-homogeneous: We
apply the same construction that was applied individual sets Si in Section 5 to the set P (with
u def= |P |/t instead of u = n0/t), obtaining one-sided ε-approximants of size polynomial in 1/ε.
While this bound is much better than the general bound on g(ε, d) from Theorem 2, it is still
far from the known bounds for ε-nets: Every orientation-homogeneous set admits an ε-net of
in Rd for d ≥ 3, where α is

size only O(cid:0)ε−1α(ε−1)(cid:1) in the plane and of size only ε−12α(ε−1)O(1)

the inverse Ackermann function [AKN+08].

• The diagonal of the stretched grid is a speciﬁc orientation-homogeneous sequence considered
in [BMN10] and in [BMN11]. Denote it D. The authors in [BMN11] obtained a lower bound
for ε-nets for D from the lower bound for the interval chains problem considered in [AKN+08].
Similarly, a lower bound for the interval chains problem discussed in Section 4 would yield a
lower bound for ε-approximants for D.

• In Theorem 2 it is possible to assure that the one-sided approximant A is a genuine set rather
than a multiset. It is easy to do so if P is in general position, as we may simply perturb each point
of A slightly. In general, we cannot ensure that each sequence Si is orientation-homogeneous,
but we can ensure that each Si is orientation-homogeneous inside the aﬃne subspace ahull Si.

That can be done by using Ramsey’s theorem to extract subsequences of bP that lie in a proper

aﬃne subspace, and then using the induction on the dimension. We can then perturb the points
of Ai within ahull Si. The rest of the argument remains the same.
