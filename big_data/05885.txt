ABSTRACT

NGC 2264-C is a high-mass protocluster where several star-formation events
are known to have occurred. To investigate whether past protostellar activity has
left a chemical imprint in this region, we mapped it in SiO(J = 2 − 1), a shock
tracer, and several other molecular lines with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope. Our
observations show the presence of a complex network of protostellar outﬂows. The
strongest SiO emission lies beyond a radius of ∼ 0.1 pc with respect to the center
of the clump, and is characterized by broad (> 10 km s−1) lines and abundances
of ∼ 1.4× 10−8 with respect to H2. Interestingly, SiO appears relatively depleted
(χSiO ∼ 4 × 10−9) within this radius, despite it being aﬀected by molecular
outﬂow activity. We attribute this to fast condensation of SiO back onto dust
grains and/or rapid gas-phase destruction of SiO, favored by the high density
present in this area (> 106 cm−3). Finally, we identify a peripheral, narrow-line
(∼ 2 km s−1) component, where SiO has an abundance of a few times 10−11.
After considering diﬀerent options, we conclude that this weak emission may
be tracing protostellar shocks from the star formation episode that preceded
the current one, which have decelerated over time and eventually resulted in
SiO being largely depleted/destroyed. Alternatively, a population of unresolved
low-mass protostars may be responsible for the narrow SiO emission. High-
angular resolution observations are necessary to distinguish between these two
possibilities and thus understand the role of SiO as a chemical tracer of past
star-formation episodes in massive protoclusters.

Introduction

1.1. High-mass star and cluster formation

There is substantial evidence that most stars in our Galaxy form in clustered environ-
ments rather than in isolation (e.g. Lada & Lada 2003). These populated environments, or
protoclusters, are excellent laboratories to study a variety of physical and chemical processes,
such as cloud fragmentation and feedback from young (proto-)stars on their surroundings
(see Krumholz et al. 2014 for a review). Moreover, high-mass stars (M(cid:63) > 8 M(cid:12)) tend to
form in dense clusters. The study of protoclusters is therefore essential if we aim to investi-
gate the dominant star-formation mode in our Galaxy and, in particular, the formation of
high-mass stars, which still poses some major questions.

One of such major questions is how a massive molecular core can evolve without frag-
menting into smaller cores. Some solutions have been proposed, such as radiative feed-
back or heating from a ﬁrst generation of low-mass (proto-)stars (Krumholz et al. 2007,
Krumholz & McKee 2008, Longmore et al. 2011). If this is the case, an episode of low-mass
star formation should precede the formation of massive stars. This implies that the molecu-
lar cloud hosting such a protocluster should resist global gravitational collapse long enough
to allow the formation of more than one generation of protostars. In short, some forces must
be present that counterbalance gravity on protocluster scales (∼ 1 pc) for several free-fall
times.

Turbulent motions within molecular clouds may provide an eﬀective source of energy act-
ing against gravity. In particular, protostellar feedback has been proposed to be a potentially
dominant source of turbulence replenishment in active protoclusters. Li & Nakamura (2006)
performed 3D magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of cluster formation, and found that the
initial cloud turbulence is quickly replaced by motions generated by outﬂows, thus keeping
the cloud stable against gravitational collapse long after the initial turbulence has dissipated.
Other theoretical and observational studies that followed lend further support to this ﬁnding
(e.g. Nakamura & Li 2007, Stanke & Williams 2007, Matzner 2007, Nakamura et al. 2011).
In the present study, we target an active high-mass protocluster where such a scenario may
be taking place: NGC 2264-C.

– 3 –

1.2. The target: NGC 2264-C

NGC 2264C is a molecular clump located at a distance of 740 pc (Kamezaki et al. 2014),
known to be surrounded by a large cluster of pre-main-sequence stars (e.g. Sung et al. 1997,
Rebull et al. 2002, Sung et al. 2008). It contains multiple dense cores amounting to a total
mass of 1650 M(cid:12) (Peretto et al. 2006), and very complex CO line wing components from
multiple molecular outﬂows (Maury et al. 2009). At the geometrical center of the clump lies
the most massive molecular core in this site, CMM3 (50 M(cid:12)), which is thought to be the
precursor of a high-mass star. Saruwatari et al. (2011) proposed it to be a very young massive
protostellar candidate based on the discovery of a compact CO outﬂow with a dynamical
age of a few hundred years. More recently, Watanabe et al. (2015) reported further evidence
of the core’s youth based on its chemical composition, which displays high abundances of
deuterated molecules and carbon chains relative to those measured in Orion KL, and low
abundances of complex organic molecules.

In summary, there is considerable evidence suggesting that NGC 2264C has experienced
more than one episode of star formation, with one of the latest potentially being that of a
massive star. This region therefore appears to be a clear case where low-mass star formation
precedes high-mass star formation, and where protostellar outﬂows may have provided the
necessary amount of turbulence to avoid fast cloud collapse.

1.3. SiO, a tracer of protostellar activity

Protostellar outﬂow activity may leave a molecular trace on its host cloud that might
take a long time to erase completely. Our goal here is to assess whether SiO can be used
as such a tracer in NGC 2264C. If so, it could provide an astrochemical means to evaluate
the presence of old protostellar activity and past star-formation episodes in other high-mass
star-formation sites hosting very young massive cores.

The choice of SiO for this study relies on its association with shocks, in particular
those originating from protostellar outﬂows (e.g. Gueth et al. 1998, Codella et al. 2007,
Tafalla et al. 2015). Indeed, the abundance of SiO in the gas phase can be enhanced by sev-
eral orders of magnitude in protostellar shocks due to sputtering of Si atoms from grains or
direct vaporisation of SiO from grain mantles (e.g. Gusdorf et al. 2008, Guillet et al. 2009,
Anderl et al. 2013). Since the SiO depletion time back onto the grains, as well as the time
scale for its gas-phase destruction, is quite fast in protostellar regions (typically ∼ 104 years;
Bergin et al. 1998, Pineau des Forˆets et al. 1997), this molecule should be enhanced prefer-
entially close to shocks and should therefore be associated with high velocities. However,

– 4 –

a typically extended, narrow-line component has also been detected in a number of star-
forming regions. This may be associated to past high-velocity shocks that have decelerated
with time, and that have not yet suﬀered complete depletion (e.g. Codella et al. 1999),
although other explanations are possible, such as low-velocity shocks caused by large-scale
ﬂow collisions during global collapse or by dynamical interaction of two clouds, for instance
(Jim´enez-Serra et al. 2010, Sanhueza et al. 2013).

With all the above in mind, we have mapped NGC 2264C in SiO(J = 2 − 1) and other
molecular tracers with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. The observations are described in
Sect. 2. Maps and spectra are presented in Sect. 3, and a quantitative analysis is provided
in Sect. 4. We discuss our results in Sect. 5 and conclude in Sect. 6.

2. Observations

We obtained maps of NGC 2264-C in SiO(J = 2 − 1), CH3OH(20 − 10 A+), and
H13CO+(J = 1− 0) with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory
(NRO) in 2009 March (SiO) and 2011 April - May (CH3OH and H13CO+). The side-band-
separating (2SB) mixer receiver T100H/V was used as a frontend with typical system noise
temperature of 160 – 360 K and 160 – 270 K for the SiO and the CH3OH/H13CO+ observa-
tions, respectively. The beam size of the Nobeyama 45 m telescope was 19(cid:48)(cid:48) at 86 GHz. The
main beam eﬃciency (ηmb) was 42%. The backends used were the accousto-optical radio
spectrometers AOS-H, whose bandwidth and frequency resolution were 40 MHz and 37 kHz,
respectively. The position switch method was employed with an oﬀ position of (R.A. oﬀset,
Dec. oﬀset) = (+2(cid:48), +30(cid:48)). The intensity scale was calibrated to the antenna temperature
(T ∗
A) scale by the chopper-wheel method and its accuracy is estimated to be 20 %. The
telescope pointing was checked every hour by observing the SiO maser source GX Mon. The
pointing accuracy is conﬁrmed to be better than 5(cid:48)(cid:48). The mapped area is about 4.2(cid:48) × 4.2(cid:48)
centered at (R.A., Dec.) = (06h41m12.3s, +09◦29(cid:48)12(cid:48)(cid:48)) with a grid spacing of 19(cid:48)(cid:48). At the
central 1.4(cid:48) × 1.6(cid:48) of the SiO map, the grid spacing is a nyquist grid of 9.5(cid:48)(cid:48).

The data were reduced using the software package NEWSTAR, developed by NRO.
After subtracting the baseline via 1st order polynomial ﬁtting, ﬁnal spectra were obtained
for each position in the map. The T ∗
A scale was converted to the main-beam brightness
temperature (Tmb) scale by Tmb = T ∗

A/ηmb.

We observed CO(J = 1 − 0) in 2012 March with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope. The
T100H/V receiver was used as front end with a typical system noise temperature of 250 –
280 K. The resulting beam size of the NRO 45 m telescope was 15(cid:48)(cid:48) at 115 GHz. The main

– 5 –

beam eﬃciency (ηmb) was 33 %. The backends used were the SAM45 auto-correlators, whose
bandwidth and frequency resolution were 125 MHz and 30.52 kHz, respectively. The on-
the-ﬂy mapping method (Sawada et al. 2008) was employed to cover a 3(cid:48) × 4(cid:48) area centered
at (R.A., Dec.) = (06h41m12.3s, +09◦29(cid:48)12(cid:48)(cid:48)), with the oﬀ position being (R.A. oﬀset, Dec.
oﬀset) = (+2(cid:48), +30(cid:48)). In order to reduce the noise derived from scanning eﬀects, we obtained
two CO maps with two diﬀerent orthogonal scanning directions and combined them in the
data reduction procedure. The intensity scale was calibrated to the T ∗
A scale by the chopper-
wheel method. The T ∗

pointing accuracy is better than 5(cid:48)(cid:48) based on observations of the SiO maser source GX Mon.

A scale was converted to the Tmb scale using Tmb = T ∗

The data were reduced using the software package NOSTAR (Sawada et al. 2008), de-
veloped by NRO. After subtracting the baseline via 1st order polynomial ﬁtting, the data
were re-sampled with a grid size of 6(cid:48)(cid:48) and integrated. In the re-sampling procedure, the
angular resolution was broadened to ∼ 19.5(cid:48)(cid:48).

The observed molecular transitions are listed in Table 1, along with their properties.

The average systemic velocity of NGC 2264-C is 7.5 km s−1.

3.1.

Integrated maps and spectra

Figure 1 presents the integrated SiO(J = 2 − 1) map of NGC 2264-C (color scale),
obtained by integrating the emission of each velocity channel with a signal-to-noise (S/N)
ratio above or equal to 5 in the channel map. Overlaid on the map are the corresponding
spectra at each oﬀset position observed. Analogous maps are shown in the lower panels of
Fig. 1 for H13CO+(J = 1 − 0) and CH3OH(20 − 10 A+) (hereafter H13CO+ and CH3OH,
respectively).

Columns 2 and 3 in Table 2 list the velocity ranges used to obtain the integrated maps
and the resulting RMS noise. Note the wide velocity range of SiO emission relative to that of
H13CO+, which indicates a clear association of the former with high-velocity gas. In the case
of CH3OH, due to blending with two other methanol lines, we employed the same velocity
range as for H13CO+. This includes only the central velocity channels and excludes the
emission from the line wings.

A ﬁrst glance at the SiO, H13CO+, and CH3OH maps immediately reveals how diﬀerently
these three molecules trace the region. While H13CO+ mostly traces the central area of
NGC 2264-C, where the gas is denser (see Peretto et al. 2006), SiO primarily emits in a more

integrated maps (color scale). The velocity ranges used to obtain the maps are [–

Black circles mark the positions of the millimeter cores identiﬁed by Peretto et al. (2006,

peripheral area and appears relatively depleted at the center. CH3OH, on the other hand, is
enhanced both at the center and at the periphery. This suggests that, in this source, CH3OH
traces both dense gas (as H13CO+) and shocked regions (as SiO).

3.2. Three SiO components

In order to understand the spatial distribution and nature of the SiO emission in
NGC 2264-C, we examined both its line intensity and width, relative to those of H13CO+.
To this aim, Fig. 2 presents two images: the SiO-to-H13CO+ integrated map (left), and the
SiO-to-H13CO+ moment 2 –or line width– map (right). The former was obtained using the
same velocity interval for both SiO and H13CO+ (∆Vctr in Table 2), while for the latter we
used the entire velocity ranges with emission above 5σ (∆Vtot in Table 2). The plotted area
comprises all the positions where the emission of SiO exceeds a S/N of 3. Within this area,
the S/N of the H13CO+ emission always exceeds 15.

Figure 1 and 2 (left) clearly show how the strongest SiO emission is oﬀset with respect
to the massive molecular core CMM3 at the center of NGC 2264-C, thus tracing a relatively
peripheral area of the molecular clump. From Fig. 2 (right), one notices that the width of the
SiO line also tends to be broad in this area, more than twice that of H13CO+. This region is
thus characterized by high-velocity shocks that are likely the result of a complex network of
protostellar outﬂows within NGC 2264-C. Close to CMM3, the SiO line emission is weaker
but nevertheless broad, also suggesting the presence of high-velocity shocks. Finally, further
out with respect to the enhanced SiO emission region, there is an area where SiO lines are
both relatively weak and narrow, especially towards the north and north-west. Indeed, the
line width of SiO in this external area is comparable to that of H13CO+. Thus, overall, we
can distinguish three diﬀerent SiO components:

• Broad-line SiO component (hereafter broad or B): it comprises the area where the
emission of SiO is most prominent. The SiO lines have full-widths at zero power
(FWZP) between 20 and 40 km s−1. This component is spatially oﬀset with respect
to the center of the molecular clump, which, together with the high-velocity SiO line
wings associated with it, indicates the presence of a circumcluster shocked region due
to protostellar activity within the molecular clump.

• Central SiO component (hereafter central or C): it lies at the center of the clump,
around the molecular cores CMM3 and CMM13, where the gas is densest according to
Peretto et al. (2006). It is characterized by weaker SiO emission than the broad com-
ponent, but it also displays high-velocity line wings suggestive of protostellar outﬂows,

of NGC 2264-C, and it exhibits weak and narrow (∼ 2 km s−1) SiO lines relative to
H13CO+.

For reference, Fig. 3 shows sample spectra for each of the three diﬀerent components,
extracted at the positions indicated in the ﬁgure caption and labelled in Fig. 2 (B4, C1,

positions representative of each of the three SiO components, whose molecular spectra are
used in Sect. 4 to derive their respective molecular column densities and abundances. Some
of these coincide with molecular cores identiﬁed by Peretto et al. (2006, 2007). For example,
CMM3 and CMM13 are two of the selected positions representing the central component.

3.3. Outﬂow maps

High-velocity SiO emission is widely present across ∼ 0.5 pc in NGC 2264-C. This is
strongly supportive of a large amount of protostellar outﬂow activity, as reported by Maury
et al. (2009) from CO(J = 2 − 1) observations. We have obtained SiO(J = 2 − 1) and
CO(J = 1 − 0) outﬂow maps by integrating the blue- and red-shifted high-velocity emission
of the lines. These are presented in Fig. 4.

Since CH3OH is blended with other methanol lines, an outﬂow assessment from this
molecular tracer is unreliable. Nevertheless, a qualitative analysis of the unblended blue-
and red-shifted line wings from the two E-state transitions of CH3OH (see the spectra in
Fig. 3) shows that they are not as prominent as those of SiO, which span more than 10 km s−1
from the ambient velocities. The outﬂow maps using the unblended line wings of methanol
show a similar distribution to that of SiO (Fig. 4). However, since this emission arises from
two lines that are not considered in the analysis below, we do not present the maps here. For
CO(J = 1 − 0), the line wings are not so extended either, but this is most likely due to the
much lower sensitivity –by a factor 10– of the observations for this molecule (see Table 1).

The outﬂow maps in Fig. 4 show how the spatial distribution of the blue- and red-
shifted high-velocity emission is rather complex. The blue-shifted emission is dominant
towards the east of the clump, while the red-shifted emission concentrates mostly towards the
west. Unfortunately, the angular resolution of our observations does not allow us to clearly
separate the individual molecular outﬂows and associate them to particular molecular cores.
The maps rather show a tangled circumcluster shock network. Despite this, hints of the very
collimated molecular outﬂow deﬁned by Maury et al. (2009) as ﬂows F1 (red-shifted; north
of CMM13) and F2 (blue-shifted; south of CMM13), are evident in our CO outﬂow map.
It should be noticed that the CO emission may be moderately optically thick even at the
high-velocity wings (see Sect. 4.2).

4. Derivation of column densities and abundances

In order to evaluate the nature of the diﬀerent SiO components identiﬁed in Sect. 3.2,
we provide here an estimate of molecular column densities and abundances at each selected
position (Table 3).

maps start at 5σ and increase by steps of 3σ, while for the CO maps they start at 25σ and
increase by steps of 5σ (see Table 2). Black circles mark the positions of the cores identiﬁed

4.1. Column density of the narrow component

Under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the total column

density of a given molecule, N , is described by Boltzmann’s equation as:

N =

Nu
gu

Q(Tex)e

− Eu
kTex

(1)

where Nu, gu, Tex, Q(Tex), Eu, and k are, respectively, the column density of the upper
energy-state, its degeneracy, the excitation temperature describing the level populations, the
partition function at a given Tex, the energy of the upper state, and Boltzmann’s constant.

The column density of the upper-energy state is given by:

(cid:90)

coeﬃcient for spontaneous emission, Planck’s constant, and the velocity-integrated optical
depth of the molecular line, respectively. With only one observed transition per molecule,
we have no means to constrain Tex. We therefore adopt three diﬀerent values: Tex = 10, 20,
and 40 K. For each of these, and for each molecular tracer, we have estimated the integrated
optical depth as the discrete summation of the optical depth at each velocity channel, n, of

constant width δv: (cid:88)

Table 3 lists the velocity ranges used to integrate the emission and obtain the column
density of SiO, CH3OH, and H13CO+ in the six positions selected to represent the narrow
component. These ranges comprise the velocity channels where the emission of H13CO+,
which displays no high-velocity wings, exceeds 3σ. In the case of CMM1, the emission is
double peaked, and hence a wide velocity range is measured.

The resulting column densities for each of the three adopted values of Tex are presented
in Table 4. Since the central velocities of CO(J = 1 − 0) correspond to heavily self-absorbed

– 17 –

emission in most of the mapped area, we do not consider them here. Instead, we will analyse
the emission of the CO high-velocity line wings in Sect. 4.2.

4.2. Column density of the broad and central components

Following an analogous procedure to that described in Sect. 4.1, we derived the SiO and
CO column densities at each selected position of the broad and central components, which
trace high-velocity molecular gas from the protocluster activity. For CO, we integrated the
line emission only at the blue- and red-shifted line wings, as indicated in column 3 of Table 3.
The velocity ranges used in the integration were determined by comparing the CO line with
the H13CO+ line and following the same approach described in L´opez-Sepulcre et al. (2009):
we deﬁned the low-velocity limits where the line intensity of H13CO+ falls below 2σ, and
the high-velocity limits where the line intensity of the two outﬂow tracers falls below 2σ.
For SiO, we provide two estimates of the column density: one that includes only the blue-
and red-shifted line wings (NSiO (blue) and NSiO (red)), as in the case of CO, and one that
includes the total column density of SiO integrated across the entire velocity range where
the emission exceeds 2σ (NSiO (tot)).

The resulting column densities, again adopting Tex = 10, 20, and 40 K, are listed in
Table 5. We note that, while the SiO emission is mostly optically thin across the whole
velocity range, that of CO is moderately optically thick even in the high-velocity wings.
The velocity-averaged optical depth in the CO wings ranges between 0.04 and 3.9 depending
on the oﬀset position and the excitation temperature adopted, with typical values of 0.12
(Tex = 40 K) and 0.9 (Tex = 10 K). These optical depths are taken into account in the
derivation of column densities, as detailed in Sect. 4.1.

4.3. Molecular abundances

Finally, we estimated the SiO abundance at each selected position. For the narrow
component, we adopted a ﬁxed HCO+ abundance across the region of 5 × 10−9 with respect
to H2. While this may introduce some uncertainty in the abundance derivation, several
studies show that the abundance of HCO+ does not vary signiﬁcantly from this value bewteen
outﬂows and dense cores (see S´anchez-Monge et al. 2013 and references therein). Since we
observed the 13C isotopologue of HCO+, we adopted 12C/13C = 60, as in Watanabe et al.
(2015). With these assumptions, the derived SiO abundances are on the order of a few times
10−11 for the narrow component. The values are reported in column 6 of Table 4.

Estimates of the CH3OH abundance are also provided in column 7 of Table 4 for the
narrow component. The methanol abundance associated with the high-velocity gas cannot
be reliably determined due to line blending with two other transitions of the same species,
as mentioned earlier.

Since H13CO+ displays no detectable extended line wings, we cannot use this tracer to
determine the SiO abundance of the high-velocity gas for the broad and central components.
Instead, we have used the column densities obtained for the extended wings of the CO lines,
by adopting a CO abundance of 10−4 with respect to H2. The SiO abundances derived in
this manner are listed in columns 8 and 9 of Table 5, for the blue- and red-shifted line wings,
respectively. They are on the order of 10−9−10−8, with the central component having smaller
abundances than the broad component by a factor 2 − 3. For cosistency, we also derived
a lower limit to the SiO abundance using a 2σ upper limit on the H13CO+ column density
at high velocities. The resulting values are on the order of 10−9 or smaller, and therefore
consistent with the abundances obtained using the CO column densities.

Table 6 summarizes, for each component, the mean column densities and abundances
of the sample of selected positions in Fig. 2, along with their standard deviations. For the
broad and central components, two SiO column density estimates are provided, as explained
in Sect. 4.2: one that considers only the high-velocity gas, B and C, and one that considers
the total amount of gas including ambient and high velocities, B (tot) and C (tot). For the
undetected line wings of H13CO+, a 2σ upper limit is provided.

Several points can be extracted from this table. First, while the narrow component
shows little dispersion in the SiO and H13CO+ column densities, resulting in a low dispersion
of the mean SiO abundance, the broad component has a more scattered range of SiO and
CO column densities, which results in a large dispersion of the mean SiO abundance. The
central component has a low scatter in the SiO column density values, but a high one for
CO, which yields a large dispersion for the mean SiO abundance. Second, the abundances

– 21 –

of SiO and CH3OH vary by less than a factor 2 from Tex = 10 K to Tex = 40 K. The column
densities diﬀer by a factor lower than 2 for all the molecules except CH3OH, for which the
diﬀerence rises up to a factor 4. Finally and most importantly, the abundance of SiO in the
narrow component is more than two orders of magnitude lower than that in the central and
broad components. In addition, the central component appears less abundant in SiO than
the broad component by an average factor of 2.

5. Discussion

In the present section, we discuss the narrow, broad, and central components on the

basis of our results and those reported in the literature.

5.1. Central SiO depletion

Figure 5 shows the total column densities of SiO, H13CO+, and CH3OH, derived as-
suming Tex = 10 K for each selected position in Table 3, and plotted as a function of radial
distance from CMM3, i.e. roughly the center of the clump. The plots for Tex = 20 and 40 K
are very similar qualitatively. The SiO plot clearly highlights the three distinct components
that we identiﬁed in Sect. 3.2. If we concentrate on the shortest radial distances, it is evident
that the column density is almost a factor 3 lower within a radius of 25(cid:48)(cid:48) (0.09 pc) from the
center than at larger distances up to about 60(cid:48)(cid:48) (0.22 pc), where the strongest SiO emission
can be seen in Fig. 11. This decrease in the amount of gaseous SiO towards the center of the
protocluster contrasts with the column density proﬁle of H13CO+, which peaks at the center
and gradually decreases with increasing radial distance.

Therefore, it appears that the central area of NGC 2264-C has a relative depletion of
SiO despite it showing signs of protostellar-outﬂow activity, as acknowledged from (i) the
high-velocity wings present in the SiO line proﬁles and (ii) the CO outﬂow maps reported
by Maury et al. (2009). Depletion of gaseous SiO may occur through freeze-out back onto
dust grains, which has a reported timescale of ∼ 104 years (Bergin et al. 1998). It may also
be destroyed via a neutral-neutral reaction with OH, yielding SiO2, which has no activation
barrier. This reaction is slow, with a rate constant of 2 × 10−12 cm3 s−1 (KIDA database2,

of a compact outﬂow driven by this source (Saruwatari et al. 2011).

Wakelam et al. 2012), but it is expected to be eﬀective in outﬂow regions due to the enhanced
abundances of OH in shocks (see e.g. Ceccarelli et al. 1998, Goicoechea et al. 2006, where
OH abundances of ∼ 10−6 are measured). The reported timescale of this reaction is also
on the order of 104 years (Pineau des Forˆets et al. 1997). However, both in the case of SiO
depletion onto dust grains and of SiO gas-phase destruction, the quoted time scales assume a
gas volume density of 105 cm−3. The density around the center of NGC 2264-C is calculated
to be higher than 106 cm−3 and as high as 108 cm−3 (see Fig. 9 in Peretto et al. 2006). In these
high density conditions, the depletion of gaseous SiO is expected to be much faster, as fast
as a few hundred years. We may thus be seeing the result of partial destruction/depletion
of SiO in this central region.

An analogous behavior has been reported in e.g.

the low-mass protostar NGC 1333
IRAS 2A, where SiO emission becomes weaker very close to the driving source due to the
enhanced density (Jørgensen et al. 2004). However, the radial distances involved in that
case are on the order of 103 AU and they concern an individual protostar, while in our case
we measure a radial distance two orders of magnitude larger: it is a protocluster rather than
a protostar eﬀect.

Methanol (CH3OH), on the other hand, does not show evidence of central depletion in
Fig. 5. However, it should be kept in mind that, for this molecule, we have only integrated
the emission at the central line velocities to obtain its column density. The values in this
plot should be thus taken as lower limits and are subject to larger errors than the other
two molecules. The column densities derived for the narrow (N) component are most likely
closer to the actual values than those of the central (C) and broad (B) components, since
the line widths are narrower and thus less line ﬂux has been missed in the calculation.
Nevertheless, this plot, as well as the CH3OH map in Fig. 1, indicates that this molecule’s
emission is relatively stronger at the center than SiO. Therefore, CH3OH does not suﬀer
the same kind of partial depletion as SiO in the inner region of the protocluster. This may
be due to the higher degree of volatility of CH3OH and the high temperatures close to the
presumed hot core within CMM3 (Watanabe et al. 2015), which favor the direct vaporisation
of methanol from grain mantles through heating.
Indeed, methanol will be signiﬁcantly
sublimated from the mantles at temperatures above 85 K (Brown & Bolina 2007). CH3OH
may also be released into the gas as a result of protostellar shocks, but depletion back onto
dust grains would not occur as rapidly as for SiO, especially if temperatures are not very
low (e.g. Yanagida et al. 2014).

5.2. Narrow SiO emission: A tracer of a previous star formation episode?
The top panel in Fig. 5 shows clearly how, beyond a radial oﬀset of 80(cid:48)(cid:48) (i.e. ∼ 0.3 pc)
from the center, the total SiO column density decreases drastically by one order of magnitude.
The change is even more pronounced in terms of abundance, where the diﬀerence is of
more than two orders of magnitude with respect to the broad component (see Table 6). As
discussed above, the SiO lines are also much narrower here, with average Full Widths at
Half Maximum (F W HM ) of 2 km s−1 and no detectable high-velocity wings. This kind
of SiO line proﬁle has been reported in several other star-forming regions (e.g. Leﬂoch et
al. 1998, Hatchell et al. 2001, Jim´enez-Serra et al. 2010, Duarte-Cabral et al. 2014). As in the
present work, all these studies report an SiO abundance with respect to H2 around 10−11 −
10−10 for such a low-velocity component, i.e. much lower than the abundances typically
associated with fast outﬂow shocks (10−9 − 10−7; e.g. Bachiller & P´erez-Guti´errez 1997,
S´anchez-Monge et al. 2013, this work). The abundances associated with this narrow SiO
emission are, however, higher than those found in dark clouds ((cid:46) 10−12; Ziurys et al. 1989,
Requena-Torres et al. 2007). Therefore, something must be causing this slight enhancement
of gaseous SiO.

A possible explanation for this low-velocity SiO component, ﬁrst proposed by Leﬂoch
et al. (1998) and Codella et al. (1999), is that this emission traces old protostellar outﬂow
shocks, which have decelerated and become signiﬁcantly depleted in SiO over time. Codella
et al. estimated the deceleration timescale to be on the order of 104 years, the same time
scale in which SiO would have been largely depleted back onto dust grains and/or destroyed
in the gas phase via reactions with OH. This scenario is consistent with both the narrow
SiO line proﬁle and the relatively low SiO abundance.

To evaluate whether this could be the case in NGC 2264-C, we consider both the spatial
distribution of the narrow SiO emission in Figs. 1 and 2, and the dynamical age of the molec-
ular outﬂows identiﬁed by Maury et al. (2009). The narrow SiO component is distributed
mostly near the northern and eastern edges of the protocluster, suﬃciently close to the tips of
several CO outﬂows identiﬁed by Maury et al. These CO outﬂows have reported dynamical
ages of ∼ 104 years. Therefore, it is possible that the narrow SiO emission is tracing older
shocks from such molecular outﬂows, which have decelerated to ambient velocities. At the
radial distance where the low-velocity component is located, the average gas density is on
the order of 105 cm−3 (Peretto et al. 2006), thus consistent also with a depletion timescale
of about 104 years (Bergin et al. 1998). However, as can be seen in Fig. 5, the radial change
in column density is rather sudden from the broad to the narrow component positions, and
the abundance decrease is even steeper. One would expect a more gradual gradient if the
low-velocity SiO emission were due to the ageing of the molecular outﬂow as it travels further

– 25 –

away from its driving source.

An alternative explanation for such a drastic spatial change in the SiO abundance is
the following. NGC 2264-C is known to have experienced more than one episode of star
formation.
It might be possible that the narrow SiO emission seen in this region has its
origin in the star formation episode that preceded the one that is currently taking place. If
this is so, the astrochemical remnants of that previous episode would have been replaced by
those of the current protostellar activity everywhere but in the most external areas of the
protocluster, where contamination from current outﬂows is less important. It is not obvious
to unambiguously identify such a stellar population, as it may be deeply embedded in the gas
and thus undetectable/unresolvable at the angular resolution of our observations. Further-
more, the known young stars detected in infrared (IR) studies (Lada et al. 1993), may be the
result of an even earlier star formation episode (their ages are 105− 106 years), and a K-band
source is also known to reside close to CMM3 (Schreyer et al. 1997, 2003). These evolved
sources are thus unlikely to be responsible for the narrow SiO component detected. Per-
haps the previous star-formation episode is related to the B2-type Zero-Age Main Sequence
(ZAMS) star, IRS1, to the north-west of NGC 2264-C (Allen 1972, Thompson et al. 1998).
This high-mass star opens up a cavity that is 0.1 pc in diameter, and it is surrounded by
a shell of molecular gas that contains the cores CMM5, CMM10, CMM11, and CMM12,
which are believed to be the result of star formation triggered by IRS1. While this is merely
a speculation, IRS1 might be part of the stellar population that formed before the younger
cores at the center and east of the protocluster. Indeed, a large fraction of the narrow SiO
emission is located to the north and west of IRS1.

5.3. Other possible origins of the narrow SiO emission

We have discussed above how the narrow SiO emission we detect may be tracing a
previous episode of star formation in NGC 2264-C. In this section we explore alternative
explanations. For instance, Jim´enez-Serra et al. (2010) proposed that such narrow SiO lines
could be produced by low-velocity shocks due to large-scale ﬂow collisions during global cloud
collapse. The authors argued that shock velocities of ∼ 12 km s−1 could account for the SiO
gas abundances of about 10−11 observed in the infrared-dark cloud (IRDC) G35.39–00.33.
This scenario is favoured also by Duarte-Cabral et al. (2014), who performed interferometric
observations of SiO(J = 2 − 1) in the high-mass star-forming complex Cygnus X. They
proposed an evolutionary picture in which the earliest stages of protocluster formation are
characterised by extended low-velocity SiO emission that traces shocks from the large-scale
collapse of material onto them. At later stages, when star formation becomes more active and

– 26 –

single massive protostars are formed, the SiO luminosity is largely dominated by powerful
outﬂows, and the weaker narrow component shows the last remnants of the initial collapse.
If this is the case for NGC 2264-C, we could be witnessing the later evolutionary stages
mentioned by Duarte-Cabral et al., where the multiple outﬂows present dominate the SiO
emission, and the last hints of large-scale collapse can only be seen at the outskirts of the
region in the form of narrow and weak SiO lines.

Peretto et al. (2006) found that NGC 2264-C is indeed undergoing global infall along
the axis connecting CMM2, CMM3, and CMM4. However, they measure an infall velocity of
1.3 km s−1, rather small to produce the observed amounts of narrow SiO emission according
to Jim´enez-Serra et al. (2010). Furthermore, most of the narrow SiO emisison is concentrated
towards the north of the clump, a direction that is almost perpendicular to that reported
for the global infall by Peretto et al. (2006).

The northern narrow SiO emission might instead be caused by low-velocity shocks due
to the interaction of NGC 2264-C with NGC 2264-D, which lies about 1 pc north (see Fig. 1 in
Peretto et al. 2006), an option that was considered to be likely in the IRDC G28.23–00.19 by
Sanhueza et al. (2013). In NGC 2264-C, however, this may not be the most likely possibility,
since the line-of-sight velocity diﬀerence between the two clumps is 2 km s−1, and there is no
clear evidence of cloud-cloud collision between NGC 2264-C and D in the dynamical analysis
reported by Peretto et al. (2006, 2007).

In summary, the velocities involved in and around NGC 2264-C seem to be insuﬃcient
to produce the observed amounts of SiO in low-velocity shocks due only to global collapse
or cloud-cloud interaction. However, if there is some excess of silicon in the gas phase,
especially if it is in the form of SiO, lower-velocity shocks (< 10 km s−1) can eﬃciently produce
or maintain the observed amounts of gas-phase SiO (Nguyen-Lu’o’ng et al. 2013, Duarte-
Cabral et al. 2014). As suggested in Sect. 5.2, SiO is likely enhanced in NGC 2264-C as a
result of earlier high-velocity protostellar shocks. This implies that large-scale low-velocity
shocks in this region can only play a role if such SiO remnants from previous protostellar
activity are present, which lends support to the scenario that we discussed in Sect. 5.2.

Alternatively, as ﬁrst proposed by Jim´enez-Serra et al. (2010), the low-velocity SiO com-
ponent could be tracing an unresolved population of low-mass protostars. The beam dilution
of the single-dish observations would cause the SiO high-velocity wings to be undetected.
We can estimate whether a typical low-mass protostellar outﬂow might have the line wings
of SiO(J = 2 − 1) undetected at the distance of NGC 2264-C and at the angular resolution
of our single-dish observations. The high-velocity SiO wings observed in SVS 13 by Leﬂoch
et al. (1998), for instance, have intensities between 0.1 and 0.5 K in main-beam temperature
units for a beam size of 24(cid:48)(cid:48) (i.e. 5600 AU at a distance of 235 pc; Hirota et al. 2008). As-

– 27 –

suming that the low-mass outﬂow ﬁlls such a beam size (as inferred from the maps presented
in Leﬂoch et al. 1998), and extrapolating it to the distance of NGC 2264-C, this corresponds
to a size of ∼ 7.5(cid:48)(cid:48). At an angular resolution of 20(cid:48)(cid:48), the same SiO wings would have a
beam-diluted intensity of 25–125 mK, indeed undetectable or just barely detectable at the
sensitivity of our observations (see Table 1). Taking into account that the outﬂow driven by
SVS 13 is rather powerful and that weaker –and more compact– outﬂows may be present,
this is therefore a plausible alternative explanation for the narrow SiO emission.

Based on the diﬀerent arguments exposed, we favor the scenario of old protostellar ac-
tivity from a previous star formation episode or, alternatively, a population of unresolved
low-mass protostars, to explain the narrow SiO emission detected in NGC 2264-C. Disentan-
gling between these possibilities would clearly beneﬁt from high-angular resolution maps, as
well as more SiO transitions to better constrain the properties of the SiO-emitting gas.

6. Conclusions

In order to study the role of SiO as a tracer of old protostellar shocks in large pro-
toclusters, we have used the Nobeyama 45 m telescope to map the high-mass protocluster
NGC 2264-C in SiO(J = 2 − 1), as well as H13CO+(J = 1 − 0), CO(J = 1 − 0), and
CH3OH(20 − 10 A+), to further constrain the column densities and molecular abundances
across the protocluster. Our main results can be summarized as follows.

1. A complex and tangled network of molecular outﬂows is present in this region that
spans ∼ 0.5 pc in size, as evidenced from the spatial distribution of the high-velocity
line-wing emission of CO, SiO, and, to a lower extent, CH3OH.

2. We are able to identify three distinct SiO components in NGC 2264-C: (i) a broad com-
ponent that is spatially oﬀset with respect to the center of the protocluster, character-
ized by strong SiO emission and high-velocity wings indicative of protostellar outﬂow
activity; (ii) a central component within the inner 0.2 pc of the molecular clump (i.e.
around the massive molecular core CMM3), where the gas is densest, characterized by
weaker SiO emission than in the broad component, but nevertheless exhibiting high-
velocity wings suggestive of outﬂows; (iii) a narrow component, at the periphery of
the region, where SiO lines are relatively weak and narrow.

3. While the column densities of H13CO+ and CH3OH are enhanced at the center of
NGC 2264-C, SiO appears relatively depleted in this area, with column densities that
are a factor 2 to 3 lower than in the more external, broad SiO component. At the

– 28 –

high densities associated with the center of the protocluster, SiO destruction/depletion
onto dust grains may occur in timescales of only 102 − 103 years. As a result, SiO
appears relatively depleted despite the high outﬂow activity present. Beyond a radius of
∼ 0.1 pc from the center, where the gas density is relatively lower, SiO depletion occurs
in much longer timescales (∼ 104 years), which explains the stronger SiO emission of
the broad component.

4. The SiO abundance with respect to H2 associated with the peripheral narrow compo-
nent in NGC 2264-C is ∼ 4× 10−11, i.e. more than two orders of magnitude lower than
those associated with the broad and central components (∼ 1.4× 10−8 and ∼ 4× 10−9,
respectively). Such a low abundance of SiO is nevertheless higher than that associated
with dark clouds ((cid:46) 10−12).

5. We propose that the narrow SiO component may be tracing the remnants of the star
formation event that preceded the current one in NGC 2264-C. If this is the case,
the narrow SiO line emission would be providing astrochemical evidence that more
than one star-formation episode occurred in this region. Alternatively, an unresolved
population of low-mass protostars could be responsible for the narrow SiO emission,
where the non-detection of high-velocity wings would be due to beam dilution eﬀects
of the single-dish observations. Distinguishing between these two possibilities requires
high-angular resolution mapping with interferometers.

6. Based on the low large-scale infall velocities associated with NGC 2264-C (∼ 1.4 km s−1),
it is unlikely that low-velocity shocks from global collapse are responsible for the nar-
row SiO emission in this source. Similarly, low-velocity shocks due to cloud-cloud col-
lapse can hardly justify the observed narrow SiO emission, since the projected velocity
diﬀerence between NGC 2264-C and NGC 2264-D is of ∼ 2 km s−1. However, these pos-
sibilities should not be completely discarded before obtaining larger maps and, ideally,
multiple SiO transitions to better constrain the properties of the SiO-emitting gas.

Following the results of the present study, the role of SiO as a tracer of past star-
formation events should be further tested in this and other high-mass protocluster regions.

aThe values given are the mean of all the selected positions for each component, and its
standard deviation. For CH3OH and H13CO+, only the narrow component is considered, while
for CO only the broad and central components are taken into account (see text).

bColumn densities for B (tot) and C (tot) refer to those integrated across the whole velocity
range of the emission line. Column densities for B and C refer to those of the blue- and
red-shifted high-velocity emission (see text).
