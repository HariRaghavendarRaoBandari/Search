Abstract

In the present paper, we study the defocusing complex short pulse
(CSP) equations both geometrically and algebraically. From the ge-
ometric point of view, we establish the link of the motions of space
curves in Minkowski space to the defocusing CSP equations via deﬁn-
ing reciprocal (hodograph) transformation. The Lax pair is con-
structed naturally for the defocusing CSP equation.
In the second
part of the paper, we derive the the focusing CSP equation from the
single-component extended KP hierarchy by the reduction method.
As a by-product, the N -dark soliton solution in the form of determi-
nants for these equations is provided.

Introduction

Recently, a complex short pulse (CSP) equation [1]

qxt + q +

1

2 (cid:0)|q|2qx(cid:1)x = 0 ,

was proposed as an improvement for the short pulse (SP) equation

uxt = u +

1

6 (cid:0)u3(cid:1)xx ,

(1)

(2)

proposed by Sch¨afer and Wayne [2] to describe the propagation of ultra-short
optical pulses in nonlinear media. In contrast with a real-valued function for
u = u(x, t) in Eq.(2), q = q(x, t) in Eq. (1) is a complex-valued function.
Since the complex-valued function can contain the information of both am-
plitude and phase, it is more appropriate for the description of the optical
waves [3]. We have conﬁrmed this by ﬁnding the pfaﬃan-type multi-soliton
solutions with physical interpretation [1]. In contrast with no physical inter-
pretation for one-soliton solution (loop soliton) to the SP equation [4, 5], the
one-soliton solution for the CSP equation is an envelope soliton with a few op-
tical cycles. The CSP equation is mathematically related to a two-component
short pulse (2-SP) equation proposed by Dimakis & M¨uller-Hoissen [6] and
Matsuno [7] independently. If we take u = Re(q) and v = Im(q), then the
2-SP equation in [6, 7] becomes the CSP equation. We have showed that
the complex short pulse can be derived from the motion of space curves and
provide an alternative multi-soliton solution in terms of determinant based
on the KP hierarchy reduction technique [8]. The multi-breather and higher
order rogue wave solutions to the CSP equation were constructed by the
Darboux transformation method in [9]. Furthermore, we have constructed
integrable semi-discrete CSP equation and apply it as a self-adaptive mov-
ing mesh method for the numerical simulations of the CSP equation [10]. It
should be pointed out that the CSP equation and its soliton solution were
also investigated recently in [11].

The complex short pulse equation can be viewed as an analogue of the
nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation in the ultra-short regime when the
width of optical pulse is of the order 10−15s. It is well known that the NLS
equation describes the evolution of slowly varying wave packets waves in
weakly nonlinear dispersive media under quasi-monochromatic assumption,
which has been very successful in many applications such as nonlinear optics
and water waves [3, 12, 13, 14]. However, as the width of optical pulse is
in the order of femtosecond (10−15 s), then the width of spectrum of this
ultra-short pulses is approximately of the order 1015s−1, the monochromatic

2

assumption to derive the NLS equation is not valid [15]. Description of ultra-
short processes requires a modiﬁcation of standard slow varying envelope
models based on the NLS equation. That is the motivation for the study of
the short pulse equation, the complex short pulse equation and their coupled
models.

Since the NLS equation has the focusing and defocusing cases, which ad-
mits the bright and dark type soliton solutions, respectively. It is natural that
the complex short pulse equation can also have the focusing and defocusing
type, which may be proposed as

qxt + q +

1
2

σ(cid:0)|q|2qx(cid:1)x = 0 ,

where σ = 1 represents the focusing case, and σ = −1 stands for the defo-
cusing case. It turns out that this is indeed the case. Same as the focusing
CSP equation discussed in [1, 8], the defocusing CSP equation can also occur
in nonlinear optics when ultra-short pulses propagate in a nonlinear media
of defocusing type [16].

In the present paper, we attempt to study the defocusing CSP equation

(3)

(4)

qxt + q −

both geometrically and algebraically. The goal is twofold. The one is to in-
vestigate the connection between the motion of space curves with defocusing
CSP equation. The other is to ﬁnd out how these equations are reduced from
the general KP hierarchy and to construct their N-soliton solutions. The re-
mainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we establish the
connection between the motions of space curves with the defocusing equation
in Minkowski space. The Lax pair is constructed geometrically to assure the
integrability of the defocusing CSP equation. In section 3, starting from a
set of bilinear equations for single-component extended KP hierarchy, as well
as their tau functions, we deduce the defocusing CSP equations by the KP
hierarchy reduction method. Meanwhile, as a by-product, the N-dark soli-
ton solution is obtained. Section 4 is devoted to the comments and further
topics.

2 The link of the defocusing complex short
pulse equation with the motion of space
curves in Minkowski space

It has attracted much attention for the study of the connections between
the motion of curves and the soliton equations in the past [17, 18, 19, 20].

3

We have constructed the connection of the focusing CSP equation with the
motion of space curves [8]. In this section, we attempt to establish a link
of the defocusing CSP equation (4) to the motion of space curves. Firstly
Notice that the CSP equation (3) can be rewritten by

(p1 + σ|qx|2)t +

σ(|q|2p1 + σ|qx|2)x = 0 ,

1
2

so that we can deﬁne a hodograph (reciprocal) transformation

dy = ρ−1dx −

1
2

σρ−1|q|2dt,

ds = −dt,

(5)

(6)

where ρ−1 = p1 + σ|qx|2. By doing so, one can obtain the diﬀerential con-

version formula between (x, t) and (y, s)

∂x = ρ−1∂y

∂t = −∂s +

1
2

σρ−1|q|2∂y .

Therefore, the CSP equation (3) is converted into

while the convertive form of the CSP

qys = ρq ,

ρs +

2

σ(|q|2)y = 0 .

(7)

(8)

(9)

We remark here that equations (8)–(9) constitute a coupled nonlinear system.
When σ = 1, the system is called the generalized coupled dispersionless (CD)
equation, which has been studied in [21] and related references. For some
reason, when σ = −1, the system (8)–(9) was overlooked in the past and its
soliton solution has not been studied yet. In what follows, we will reformulate
the system (8)–(9) with σ = −1 geometrically in order to make clear the
geometric interpretation of the defocusing CSP equation.

It was pointed out in [10] that the generalized coupled dispersionless
equation is linked to the focusing CSP equation by a reciprocal (hodograph)
transformation, by which the Lax pair of the focusing CSP equation was
established. In [8], both the generalized coupled dispersionless equation and
the focusing CSP equation were interpreted as the motion of space curve
in Euclidean space. In what follows, we proceed to the formulation of the
geometric interpretation for the defocusing CSP equation. To this end, we
need to use the Darboux frame of γ(s) in Minkowski space with standard
metric <, >= dx2

The compatibility conditions Tsy = Tys, etc imply a more general class of

κn,s = βy − κgγ + τrα ,

τr,s = γy + ε1ε2(κgβ − κnα) .

(15)

(16)

(17)

For the standard metric used in the present paper, we have ε1 = ε2 = 1,
ε3 = −1. Therefore, combining Eq. (16) with Eq. (17), we have

(τr + iκn)s = (γ + iβ)y + iα(τr + iκn) − iκg(γ + iβ) .

(18)

If we let

τr + iκn = cqy ,
κg = cρ ,
γ + iβ = iq , α = −c−1 ,

then Eq. (18) becomes

On the other hand, since

from Eq. (17). Eqs. (21)–(22) are the coupled nonlinear systems (8)–(9)
with σ = −1. Thus the link of the complex coupled dispersionless (CCD)
system of defocusing type to the motion of space curves is established.

by setting c = −2λ−1. The above Lax pair is consistence with the one used
for constructing the Darboux transformation of the defocusing complex CD
equation [16].
The reciprocal (hodograph) link between the complex CD equation and the
CSP equation can be deﬁned geometrically. Letting c = 1 and

qy′(y′, s′)dy′ = Z y

(τr(y′, s′) + iκn(y′, s′)) dy′ ,

(31)

which implies that the integration of the torsion along the arc length remains
the new spatial variable x, while the integration of the geodesic curvature and
the normal curvature stands for the real and imaginary part of the dependent
variable q. It can be easily shown that

3 Reduction from the extended KP hierarchy

3.1 Bilinearizations of the defocusing CCD and CSP

equations

The bilinearizations of the defocusing CCD and CSP equation are established
by the following propositions.

Proposition 1. By means of the dependent variable transformations

q =

g
f

ei(y−s) ,

ρ = 1 − 2(log f )ys ,

(35)

the defocusing CCD equations (21)–(22) are transformed in to the following
bilinear equations for the tau functions f and g

(DyDs + iDs − iDy)g · f = 0 ,

Proof. Substituting the second dependent variable transformation, Eq. (22)
is simply

f 2 (cid:19)y

Integrating once in y and setting the integration constant to be 1, we then
have

which is exactly the bilinear equation (37). On the other hand, Eq. (21) is
converted into

f(cid:19)s

Referring to a bilinear identity

DyDsg · f

f(cid:19)ys

we then have the bilinear equation (36).

Proposition 2. By means of the dependent variable transformation

and the reciprocal (hodograph) transformation

x = y +

s − 2(log f )s ,

t = −s ,

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

the defocusing CSP equation (4) shares the same bilinear equations (36)–(37).

8

Proof. From the hodograph transformation and bilinear equations, we could
have

∂x
∂y

= 1 − 2(log f )ys = ρ ,

and

which implies

∂x

Thus, the defocusing CSP equation is derived from the defocusing CCD
equation based on the discussion in previous section.

3.2 Bilinear equations for the extended KP hierarchy

tau functions for extended KP hierarchy with negative ﬂows

where

with

Here pi, ¯pj, ξi0, ¯ξj0, a are constants. Based on the Sato theory for the
KP hierarchy [23, 24, 25], the above tau functions satisfy a set of bilinear
equations

(cid:18) 1

Dx1Dx−1 − 1(cid:19) τnk · τnk = −τn+1,kτn−1,k ,

(aDta − 1)τn+1,k · τnk = −τn+1,k−1τn,k+1 ,

(Dx1(aDta − 1) − 2a) τn+1,k · τnk = (Dx1 − 2a)τn+1,k−1 · τn,k+1 .

(43)

(44)

(45)

The proof is given below by referring to the Grammian technique [22, 26]. It
is easily shown that mnk

Applying the Jacobi identity of determinants to the bordered determinants
(46)–(48), the above three bilinear equations are satisﬁed.

3.3 Reduction to the complex CD equation and the

complex SP equation

In the following, we brieﬂy show the reduction process of reducing bilin-
ear equations of extended KP hierarchy (43)–(45) to the bilinear equation
(36)–(37). Firstly, we start with dimension reduction by noting that the
determinant expression of τnk,

δij +

τnk = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

1

pi + ¯pj

10

ϕnk
i ψnk

j (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)1≤i,j≤N

can be alternatively expressed by

τnk = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

δij +

1

pi + ¯pj

ϕnk
i ψnk

,

i (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)1≤i,j≤N

by dividing j-th column by ψnk
j
i, j ≤ N. By taking

and multiplying i-th row by ψnk

i

¯pj =

1
pj

,

a = i,

we can easily check that τnk satisﬁes the reduction conditions

∂x1τnk = ∂x−1τnk ,

τn−1,k+2 = τnk .

Therefore the bilinear equation (43) is reduced to

(cid:18) 1

x1 − 1(cid:19) τnk · τnk = −τn+1,kτn−1,k.

for 1 ≤

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

Moreover, by referring to the bilinear equations (44)–(45) and the reduction
conditions (50)–(51), we have

(Dx1(aDta−1)−2a)τn+1,k·τnk = −2aτn+1,k−1·τn+1,k−1 = 2a(aDta−1)τn+1,k·τnk ,

i.e.,

(Dx1(Dta + i) − 2iDta)τn+1,k · τnk = 0 .

(54)

Next, we proceed to the reduction of complex conjugate, which turns out to
be very simple. Speciﬁcally, by taking |pi| = 1 and ¯ξj0 = ξ∗
j0, where ∗ means
complex conjugate, we have ¯pi = p∗

i and

τ ∗
n0 = τ−n,0 .

Due to the relation (50), x−1 = 0 becomes a dummy variable. Therefore, we
have

τn0 = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

with

In summary, by deﬁning

(56)

Finally, by setting ta = y, 2x1 = s, the above bilinear equations coincide
with the bilinear equations (36)–(37). Therefore, the reduction process is
complete. In summary, we provide the determinant solution to the defocusing
CSP equation by the following theorem.

In the last, we list one- and two-dark soliton solutions to the defocusing
CSP equation (4). By taking p1 = e−i(ϕ1+π/2) and N = 1 in (58), we have
the tau functions for one-dark soliton solution,

f = 1 + e2η1,

g = 1 + e2(η1−iϕ1) ,

The collision process of two-dark soliton with ϕ1 = π/2 and ϕ2 = 2π/3 is
displayed in Fig. 2. We remark that, same as the defocusing NLS equation,
the collision of two-dark solitons to the defocusing CSP equation is always
elastic. The analysis is similar to the one for the NLS equation, so it is
omitted here.

4 Comments and further topics

In [16], a defocusing CSP equation was derived from physical context in non-
linear optics as an analogue of the NLS equation in ultra-short pulse regime.

Figure 2: Two-dark soliton solution at t = −30, 0, 30 with ϕ1 = π/2, ϕ2 =
2π/3.

In the present paper, we ﬁrstly established a link between the defocusing CSP
equation and the motion of space curves in Minkowski space. Therefore, the
Lax pair is constructed geometrically.

Secondly, starting from a set of bilinear equations, along with their tau
functions, of a single-component extended KP hierarchy, we derive the defo-
cusing CSP equation based on the KP-hierarchy reduction method. Mean-
while, its multi-soliton solutions is provided in determinant form.

Even though we have recently constructed various solutions including
bright, dark, breather and rogue wave solutions to the the focusing and
defocusing CSP equation [1, 8, 16, 27] including the work in the present paper.
However, it will be more interesting to investigate all kinds of solutions to the
coupled complex short pulse equation, especially the one of mixed focusing
and defocusing nonlinearity, in the future.

Finally, although integrable discretizations of the real short pulse equation
and its multi-component generalizations were recently constructed [10, 28, 29,
30, 31], how to understand and reconstruct the integrable discretizations of
the focusing and defocusing CSP equation geometrically and algebraically
remains a topic to be explored in the future.
