Abstract

In this paper we introduce a new algebraic method in tilings. Combining
this method with Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz we obtain a necessary condition
for tiling n-space by translates of a cluster of cubes. Further, the polyno-
mial method will enable us to show that if there exists a tiling of n-space
by translates of a cluster V of prime size then there is a lattice tiling by
V as well. Finally, we provide supporting evidence for a conjecture that
each tiling by translates of a prime size cluster V is lattice if V generates
n-space.

1 Introduction

A cluster in Rn is the union of unit cubes centered at integer points with their
sides parallel to coordinate axis; we note that a cluster does not have to be
connected. This paper is devoted to tilings of Rn by translates of a cluster.

An interest in tilings of Rn by cubes goes back to a conjecture raised by
Minkowski [11] in 1904; the conjecture stemmed from his work on geometry of
numbers and quadratic forms.

Conjecture 1 (Minkowski). Each lattice tiling of Rn by cubes contains twins,
a pair of cubes that share whole n − 1 dimensional face.
Minkowski’s conjecture was settled in the aﬃrmative in 1941 by Haj´os [3] who in-
troduced in that paper a powerful algebraic method called “splitting of groups.”
We note that although a cluster is a very special type of a tile, it provides a
simplest known counterexample to part (b) of the 18th problem of Hilbert:

Problem 2. If congruent copies of a polyhedron P tile R3, is there a group of
motions so that copies of P under this group tile R3?

1

In other words, the second part of the problem asks whether there exists a
polyhedron, which tiles 3-dimensional Euclidean space but does not admit an
isohedral (tile-transitive) tiling. It is shown in [1] that there is a periodic tiling
of R2 by a cluster depicted in Fig.1, but no isohedral tiling of R2 exists.

Fig.1.

In this paper we deal only with face-to-face (=regular) tilings of Rn by a
cluster C. It is not diﬃcult to see that such a tilings can be seen as a tiling of
Zn by translates of a subset V comprising centers of cubes in C. Thus, from
now on, by a tile we will mean a set V ⊂ Zn. Throughout the paper we assume
that 0 ∈ V , and we deal exclusively with tilings T of Zn by translates of V ; i.e.,

T = {V + l; l ∈ L}.

As 0 ∈ V , we will identify each tile V + l in T with l. A tiling T is termed
periodic (lattice), if L is periodic (lattice). Since Zn is a group, the fact that V
tiles Zn can be expressed as

Zn = V + L,

meaning that each element of Zn can be written in a unique way as the sum of
an element in V and an element of L, and also as
|(−V + x) ∩ L| = 1

for each x ∈ Zn.
research is oriented towards solving several long-standing conjectures.

In the area of tilings of Zn by translates of a set V most

Conjecture 3 (Lagarias-Wang 1996, [10]). If V tiles Zn, then V admits a
periodic tiling.

It is easy to see that the conjecture is true in the 1-dimensional case, but it is
still open even for n = 2. It is known though that, for n = 2, the conjecture is
true for polyominoes, cf. [1], i.e., if the corresponding cluster of cubes in R2 is
connected. Moreover, Szegedy [14] proved the conjecture in the case when V is
of a prime size. Further, Nivat [12] conjectured, that if V satisﬁes a complexity
assumption, then each tiling of Z2 by V is periodic. We note that the famous
Keller’s conjecture [9] saying that each tiling of Rn by cubes contains a pair of
twin cubes was proved to be false for all n ≥ 8, but it is still open for n = 7.

Our research has been motivated by two conjectures stated below. The ﬁrst
of them is likely the most famous conjecture in the area of error-correcting Lee
codes:

2

Conjecture 4 (Golomb-Welch 1969, [2]). The Lee sphere

Sn,r = {x ∈ Zn : |x1| + ··· + |xn| ≤ r}

does not tile Zn for n ≥ 3 and r ≥ 2.
Although there is a sizable literature on the topic, the conjecture is far from
being solved.

The n-cross is a cluster in Rn comprising 2n + 1 cubes, a central one and
its reﬂections in all faces. Thus, {0,±e1, . . . ,±en} is the set of centers of cubes
in the n-cross in Zn. It is known, see [5], that if 2n + 1 is not a prime then
there are uncountably many non-congruent tilings of Zn by the n-cross. It was
conjectured there that:

Conjecture 5. If 2n + 1 is a prime then, up to a congruence, there is only one
tiling of Zn by n-cross.

We believe, if true, the conjecture goes against our intuition that says: The
higher the dimension, the more freedom we get. The conjecture has been proved
for n = 2, 3 in [5] and for n = 5 in [7]. Thus, there is a unique tiling of Zn by
crosses for n = 2, 3, there are uncountably many tilings of Z4 by crosses, but in
Z5 there is again a unique tiling by crosses.

To attack these two conjecture we ﬁrst describe a new algebraic method,
so-called “polynomial method” that will enable us to prove some general results
on tiling Zn by translates of a cluster. We note that a similar method has been
independently developed and used in [8], where the authors focus on Nivat’s
conjecture. Szegedy [14] proved, using a new algebraic technique based on
quasigroups, that if a tile V is of a prime size then each tiling of Zn by translates
of V is periodic. The polynomial method provides a diﬀerent proof of this result:
Theorem 6. Let V ⊂ Zn, and T be a tiling of Zn by translates of V . If |V | = q
is prime, then q(v − w) is a period of T for any v, w ∈ V .
Further, applying Hilbert Nullstellensatz, we provide a necessary condition for
the existence of a tiling Zn by translates of a generic (arbitrary) set V . With
this in hand we prove that if V = {0, v1, . . . , vq−1} is of a prime size q and
{v1, . . . , vq−1} generate Zn then there is a tiling of Zn by translates of V if and
only if there is a lattice tiling of Zn by V . We conjecture a much stronger result:
Conjecture 7. Let V = {0, v1, . . . , vq−1} ⊂ Zn of a prime size q tiles Zn by
translates, and {v1, . . . , vq−1} generate Zn. Then there is a unique tiling, up to
a congruency, of Zn by V and this tiling is lattice.

Clearly, if true, the above conjecture would imply Conjecture 5. To provide
supporting evidence we prove the above conjecture for all primes ≤ 7.

2 Polynomial Method

First we describe Polynomial Method that represents our main tool when tack-
ling various tilings problems. Then we state results that, in our opinion, are of
interest on their own, but also constitute an important ingredient in the proofs
of main theorems of this paper.

Let T = {V + l; l ∈ L} be a tiling of Zn by translates of V . We deﬁne a
n ] is the commutative
n , such that, for every

linear map TT : Z[x±1
ring of Laurent polynomials generated by x±1
(a1, . . . , an) ∈ Zn,

n ] → Z, where Z[x±1

1 , . . . , x±1

1 , . . . , x±1

1 , . . . , x±1

TT (xa1

1 ··· xan

n ) =(1 if (a1,··· , an) ∈ L

0 otherwise.

If the tiling T will be clear from the context we will drop the subscript and write
simply T . We note that T is uniquely determined as the monomials xa1
1 ··· xan
n
form a basis of the ring. Let QV ∈ Z[x±1
n ] be a polynomial associated
with V , where

1 , . . . , x±1

QV (x1, . . . , xn) = X(a1,...,an)∈(−V )

xa1
1 ··· xan
n .

Then for any monomial xm1

1

··· xmn
n ,

T (xm1

1

··· xmn

n QV ) = X(a1,...,an)∈(−V )

|{(a1 + m1, . . . , an + mn)} ∩ L|

= |(−V + (m1, . . . , mn)) ∩ L| = 1.

Since the map T is linear and any polynomial is a linear combination of mono-
mials, we can immediately extend this equality to

T (P QV ) = P (1, . . . , 1)

for any polynomial P ∈ Z[x±1

1 , . . . , x±1
n ].

In what follows we will present results on tilings of Zn by translates of a
set V ⊂ Zn. Most of these results will be proved by utilizing properties of the
linear map T and the polynomial QV . We have termed this approach Polynomial
Method.

We start with a technical statement:

Theorem 8. Let T be a tiling of Zn by translates of V , and let a be an integer
relatively prime to |V |. Then, for any polynomial P ∈ Z[x±1
n ], we have

1 , . . . , x±1

T (P QV (xa

1, . . . , xa

n)) = P (1, . . . , 1).

4

Proof. This statement follows directly from the two lemmas given below since a
can be represented as a product of primes not dividing |V | and possibly −1.
Lemma 9. Let p = 1, or p be a prime which does not divide |V |. Then

T (P QV (xp

1, . . . , xp

n)) = P (1, . . . , 1)

for any polynomial P ∈ Z[x±1
Proof. Since the map T is linear, it is suﬃcient to prove that T (M Q(xp
1 for any monomial M . We have

1 , . . . , x±1
n ].

1, . . . , xp

n)) =

T (M QV (xp

1, . . . , xp

n)) ≡ T (M Qp

V ) = T (M Qp−1

V QV )

= (QV (1, . . . , 1))p−1 = |V |p−1 ≡ 1

(mod p)

since T (RQV ) = R(1, . . . , 1) for any polynomial R. Thus T (M QV (xp
1 for all monomials M .

1, . . . , xp

n)) ≥

We also have

T (M QV (xp

1, . . . , xp

n)QV ) = Xv∈V
≥ Xv∈V

T (M · xv1

1 = |V |

(1)

while on the other hand,

T (M QV (xp

1, . . . , xp

n)QV ) = QV (1p, . . . , 1p) = |V |.

It follows that the equality holds for every term in (1). For some ﬁxed v ∈ V ,
we have T (M · xv1
n)) = 1 for every monomial M . Therefore
T (M Q(xp
1, . . . , xp

1 ··· xvn
n)) = 1 for every monomial M .

n · Q(xp

Lemma 10.

T (P QV (x−1

1 , . . . , x−1

n )) = P (1, . . . , 1)

for any polynomial P ∈ Z[x±1
Proof. Again, it is suﬃcient to prove it for monomials. We ﬁrst prove

1 , . . . , x±1

T (M QV (x−1

n )) ≤ 1

for some distinct v, u ∈ (−V ). Then letting M ′ = M x−v1−u1
get
1 ··· xun

which contradicts the original property of QV . Thus T (M QV (x−1

Consider M QV (x−1
QV (1, . . . , 1) = |V | and

1 , . . . , x−1

n )QV ) =

T (M QV (x−1

1 = |V |,

all terms must attain equality. It follows that T (M QV (x−1

1 , . . . , x−1

Corollary 11. Let T = {V + l; l ∈ L} be a tiling of Zn by translates of V , and
let a be an integer relatively prime to |V | or a = −1. Then Ta = {aV + l; l ∈ L}
is a tiling of Zn by translates of a ”blow-up” tile aV = {av; v ∈ V }.
Proof. Set S = aV . Then

QS(x1, . . . , xn) = X(v1,...,vn)∈(−V )

xav1

By the above theorem,

··· xavn

n = QV (xa

1, . . . , xa

n).

T (M QS) = T (M QV (xa

1, . . . , xa
for any monomial M . Thus, for any x ∈ Zn,

n)) = M (1, . . . , 1) = 1

that is, Ta = {aV + l; l ∈ L} is a tiling of Zn by translates of aV .

|(−S + x) ∩ L| = 1,

The following corollary can be found in [14]. We provide here a short proof

of this result.
Corollary 12. Let T = {V + l; l ∈ L} be a tiling of Zn by translates of V , and
let a be an integer relatively prime to |V |. Then l + a(v − w) /∈ L for each l ∈ L
and v, w ∈ V .
Proof. By Corollary 11, Ta = {aV + l; l ∈ L} is a tiling of Zn by translates of
aV , hence Zn = aV + L. Assume that l + a(v − w) ∈ L. Then

l + av = aw + [l + a(v − w)] but also
l + av = av + l;

that is, l + av ∈ Zn would be covered by two distinct tiles of Ta.

3 A Necessary Condition for the Existence of a

Tiling

The main goal of this section is to present a necessary condition for the existence
of a tiling of Zn by translates of a generic (arbitrary) tile V . To the best of our
knowledge this is the ﬁrst condition of its type. We start by recalling a famous
theorem of Hilbert [4] that will be applied in the proof of this condition.
Theorem 13 (Nullstellensatz). Let J be an ideal in C[x1, . . . , xn], and S ⊂ Cn.
Denote by V(J) the set of all common zeros of polynomials in J, and by I(S)
the set of all polynomials in C[x1, . . . , xn] that vanish at all elements of S. Then

I(V(J)) = √J = {f ∈ C[x1, . . . , xn] : f n ∈ J for some n ≥ 1}.

The following statement is the main theorem of this section.
Theorem 14. Let V ⊂ Zn be a tile. Then there is a tiling of Zn by translates
of V only if there exist (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ (C \ {0})n such that QV (xa
n) = 0
simultaneously for all a relatively prime to |V |.
Proof. To prove the theorem we show that if there is no (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ (C\{0})n
such that QV (xa
n) = 0 simultaneously for all a relatively prime to |V |
then there is no tiling of Zn by translates of V .

1, . . . , xa

1, . . . , xa

We start with an auxiliary statement:

1 , . . . , x±1

(∗) Let {fi}i∈I ⊂ C[x±1
n ] be a set of Laurent polynomials
such that there exists no (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ (C\{0})n with fi(x1, . . . , xn) =
0 simultaneously for i ∈ I. Then there exist Laurent polynomials
p1, . . . , pk and indices i1, . . . , ik ∈ I such that
fi1 p1 + ··· + fik pk = 1.

Indeed, for each i ∈ I, consider a suﬃciently large integer ni which makes
(x1 ··· xn)ni−1fi ∈ C[x1, . . . , xn]; if fi ∈ C[x1, . . . , xn], then we simply set gi =
(x1 ··· xn)1fi. Then gi = (x1 ··· xn)ni fi is not only a polynomial, but also
a multiple of x1 ··· xn. Consider the ideal J ⊂ C[x1, . . . , xn] generated by the
polynomials gi. By the condition, there is no x ∈ (C\{0})n that makes gi(x) = 0
for all i ∈ I. On the other hand, gi(x) = 0 if any one of x1, . . . , xn is zero since
the polynomial is a multiple of x1 ··· xn. Thus it follows that
V(J) = {(x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Cn : x1x2 ··· xn = 0}
and therefore, by Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz, x1 ··· xn ∈ I(V(J)) = √J; i.e., there
exists a positive integer m for which (x1 ··· xn)m ∈ J.

Let q1, . . . , qk and i1, . . . , ik be the polynomials and indices which make

(x1 ··· xn)m = gi1q1 + ··· + gik qk

= (x1 ··· xn)ni1 fi1 q1 + ··· + (x1 ··· xn)nik fik qk.

7

Then dividing both sides by (x1 ··· xn)m, we get
+ ··· + fik

1 = fi1

q1

(x1 ··· xn)m−ni1

qk

(x1 ··· xn)m−nik

.

The proof of (∗) is complete.

We are ready to prove the theorem. Assume that there is no (x1, . . . , xn) ∈
(C\{0})n such that QV (xa
n) = 0 simultaneously for all a relatively prime
to |V |. By (∗), we obtain Laurent polynomials P1, . . . , Pt and integers a1, . . . , at
relatively prime with |V | for which

1, . . . , xa

P1Q(xa1

1 , . . . , xa1

n ) + ··· + PtQ(xat

1 , . . . , xat

n ) = 1.

Replacing all x1, . . . , xn with 1, we get

(2)

(3)

P1(1, . . . , 1) + ··· + Pt(1, . . . , 1) = 1/|V |.

Suppose that there exists a tiling of Zn be translates of V . By (2), we have, for
any monomial M ,

T (M ) = T (M (P1Q(xa1
= T (M P1Q(xa1
= P1(1, . . . , 1) + ··· + Pt(1, . . . , 1) = 1/|V |,

n ) + ··· + PtQ(xat
n )) + ··· + T (M PtQ(xat

1 , . . . , xa1
1 , . . . , xa1

1 , . . . , xat

n )))

1 , . . . , xat
(by Theorem 8)

n ))

with respect to (3). Because this diﬀers from 0 and 1, we arrive at a contradic-
tion.

Remark 15. To demonstrate that the above condition is only a necessary one,
consider a tile V given in Fig.2. We have QV (x, y) = 1 + x + y + x2y, and
x = 1, y = −1 is a common root of QV (x, y) and of QV (x3, y3). That is,
there is a non-zero common root of QV (xa, ya) for each a relatively prime to
4, although there is no tiling of Z2 by V . However, we will prove in the next
section that this condition is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for tiles of a
prime size.

Fig.2.

One of the main strength of the above theorem is that it is not limited by a
special size or by a special shape of the tile. On the other hand, it is very
diﬃcult to see whether the system has a common root if the size of the tile is
composite. Therefore, it will require additional research to enable one to apply
this theorem toward the Golomb-Welch conjuncture. On the other hand, this
theorem enables us to prove, see the next section, that there is a tiling of Zn by
translates of a prime size tile V if and only if there is a lattice tiling by V .

8

4 Tiles of a Prime Size

Using Polynomial Method, we show that if V is a tile of a prime size then each
tiling of Zn by translates of V is periodic, and that the existence of a tiling of
Zn by V guarantees the existence of a lattice tiling.
Theorem 16. Let V ⊂ Zn be a tile, and T be a tiling of Zn by translates of V .
If |V | = q is prime, then q(v − w) is a period of T for any v, w ∈ V .
Remark 17. As mentioned in the introduction, Szegedy [14] proved the state-
ment by using a new technique based on loops. Another proof of the above
statement, using similar ideas, can be found in [8].

Proof. Consider any monomial M . We have

T (M QV (xq

1, . . . , xq

n)) ≡ T (M Qq

V ) = T (M Qq−1

V QV )

= (QV (1, . . . , 1))q−1 = qq−1 ≡ 0 (mod q)

since T (RQV ) = R(1, . . . , 1) for any polynomial R. On the other hand, by
deﬁnition

T (M QV (xq

1, . . . , xq

n)) = X(a1,...,an)∈(V )

T (M x−qa1

1

··· x−qan

n

).

Since the sum of |V | = q terms, each of which are either 0 or 1, is a multiple of q,
we conclude that every term must be either simultaneously 0 or simultaneously
1. Hence for any v = (v1, . . . , vn) and w = (w1, . . . , wn) in V ,

T (M x−qv1

1

··· x−qvn

n

) = T (M x−qw1

1

··· x−qwn

n

) = 0 or 1.

It follows that for any x ∈ Zn, the point x is in L if and only if x + q(v − w) is
in L. Therefore q(v − w) is a period of T .

To prove a main result of this section we ﬁrst state a necessary and suﬃcient
condition, in terms of a homomorphism, for the existence of a lattice tiling of
Zn by translates of V . We will use this condition in the proof of the following
theorem.

Theorem 18 ([6]). Let V be a subset of Zn. Then there is a lattice tiling
T of Zn by V if and only if there is an Abelian group G of order |V | and a
homomorphism φ : Zn → G so that the restriction of φ to V is a bijection.
Now we are ready to show that the existence of a tiling guarantees the existence
of a lattice one. We point out that the same statement in the language of
Abelian groups, is given, with only a hint on the proof, in [14].
Theorem 19. Let V = {0, v1, . . . , vq−1} ⊂ Zn be a prime size tile, and suppose
that {v1, . . . , vq−1} generate Zn. Then there exists a tiling of Zn by translates
of V if and only if there is a lattice tiling of Zn by translates of V .

9

Proof. We assume that there exists a tiling and prove that there exists a lattice
tiling. From Theorem 14, we see that there exists a common nonzero solution to
QV (xa
n) = 0, where a ranges over all integers not divisible by q. Let the
terms of QV be the monomials m1, . . . , mq, where m1 = 1. If (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Cn
is a common root, then for the corresponding values of m1, . . . , mq ∈ C, we have

1, . . . , xa

ma
1 + ··· + ma

q = 0

for all a = 1, 2, . . . , q − 1.

Because it can be inductively deduced that the elementary symmetric poly-

nomials

Xi1<···<it

mi1 ··· mit = 0

for 1 ≤ t < q, we get that m1, . . . , mq ∈ C are roots of a polynomial which is of
the form

(X − m1)··· (X − mq) =

q

Xt=0

(−1)tX q−t Xi1<···<it

mi1 ··· mit = X q − c.

Because m1 = 1, the constant is c = 1, and thus m1, . . . , mq is a permutation
of 1, ζ, . . . , ζq−1 where ζ = e2πi/q.

Note that since {v1, . . . , vq−1} generate Zn, each of x1, . . . , xn can be rep-
resented as a product of powers of m1, . . . , mq. This implies that the values
x1, . . . , xn ∈ C are also powers of ζ. Let xi = ζai for each i. From the fact that
the values of m1, . . . , mq ∈ C is a permutation of 1, ζ, . . . , ζq−1, it follows that
the restriction of the homomorphism φ : Zn → Z/qZ deﬁned by

(k1, . . . , kn) 7→ a1k1 + ··· + ankn

restricted to V is a bijection. Applying Theorem 18 ﬁnishes the proof.

5 A Conjecture on Lattice Tilings

It was proved in the previous section that the existence of a tiling of Zn by a
prime size tile V guarantees the existence of a lattice tiling of Zn. In this section
we focus on with Conjecture 7 which claims that a much stronger statement is
true.
Conjecture 20. If V = {0, v1, . . . , vq−1} ⊂ Zn is of a prime size q and
{v1, . . . , vq−1} generate Zn then each tiling of Zn by V is a lattice tiling.
The following example exhibits that the condition: “{v1, . . . , vq−1} generates
Zn” cannot be replaced by a weaker assumption that V is an n-dimensional tile.

10

Example 21. If V = {0, e1, . . . , eq−2, 2eq−1} ⊂ Zq−1, then the tiling

T = {x : 2 | xq−1 and q | x · (1, 2, . . . , q − 1);
or 2 ∤ xq−1 and q | x · (q − 1, . . . , 2, 1)}

is not lattice.

First we show a rather surprising results that to prove this conjecture one
can conﬁne himself/herself to a speciﬁc tile. Later, to provide a supporting
evidence, we show that the conjecture is true for all primes q ≤ 7.
Theorem 22. Let q be a prime. If each tiling of Zq−1 by the semi-cross Vq−1 =
{0, e1, . . . , eq−1} is lattice, then each tiling of Zn by a tile V = {0, v1, . . . , vq−1},
where {v1, . . . , vq−1} generate Zn, is a lattice tiling as well.
Proof. Let T = {V +l, l ∈ L} be a tiling of Zn by a tile V = {v0, v1, . . . , vq−1} ⊂
Zn of a prime size q such that {v1, . . . , vq−1} generate Zn. We show that T
induces a tiling T0 of Zq−1 by the semi-cross Vq−1.

Let φ : Zq−1 → Zn be a homomorphism deﬁned by

(x1, . . . , xq−1) 7→

xivi.

q−1

Xi=1

Because of the condition that {v1, . . . , vq−1} generate Zn, the homomorphism
φ is surjective.

Let

T0 = φ−1(T ) =(cid:26)(x1, . . . , xq−1) ∈ Zq−1 :

xivi ∈ T(cid:27).

q−1

Since exactly one of x, x + v1, . . . , x + vq−1 is contained in T for each x ∈ Zn,
exactly one of x, x + e1, . . . , x + eq−1 is contained in T0 for each x ∈ Zq−1. Thus
T0 is actually a tiling of Zq−1 by V0 = {0, e1, . . . , eq−1}.

Because φ is surjective, the image is φ(T0) = T . If T0 is a subgroup of Zq−1,
then T also becomes a subgroup of Zn. Thus, it is suﬃcient to show that T0 is
always a lattice tiling.

The following conjecture is equivalent to Conjecture 20.

Conjecture 23. Let V = {0, v1, . . . , vq−1} ⊂ Zn of a prime size q tiles Zn by
translates, and {v1, . . . , vq−1} generate Zn. Then there is a unique tiling, up to
a congruency, of Zn by V and this tiling is lattice.

11

Indeed, if there were two non-congruent lattice tilings of Zn by V, then
the induced tilings of Zq−1 by semi-crosses would be non-congruent as well.
However, by Theorem 18, all lattice tilings of Zq−1 by semi-cross are congruent.

To provide supporting evidence we show that:

Theorem 24. Let V = {0, v1, . . . , vq−1} be a tile of a prime size q ≤ 7 such
that {v1, . . . , vq−1} generate Zn. Then each tiling of Zn by V is lattice.
To facilitate our discussion we introduce new notions and notation, and state
several auxiliary results. Let T = {Vq−1 + l; l ∈ L} be a tiling of Zq−1 by semi-
crosses. We use terminology of coding theory; that is, the elements of Zq−1 will
be called words and the elements of L, the centers of semi-crosses in T , will be
called codewords.

1 , . . . , mαs

By a word of type [mα1

s ] we mean a word having α1 coordinates
equal to m1, . . . , αs coordinates equal to ms, the other coordinates equal to
zero. Let W, Z be words, and the word Z − W is of type [mα1
s ]. Then
Z will be called a word of type [mα1
s ] with respect to W . For W = O,
we simplify the language and call Z shortly a word of type [mα1
1 , . . . , mαs
s ].
Further, we will say that a word V is covered by a codeword W if V belongs to
the semi-cross centered at W . Finally, two words A, B coincide in t coordinates,
if they have the same value in t non-zero coordinates.

The following theorem constitutes a crucial tool for proving the main result

It is possible to prove a much more general statement than the above theorem;
we skip the proof here as it is quite long and involved, and we do not need the
statement in what follows.
Theorem 26. Let T be a tiling of Zp−1 by semi-crosses, where p is a prime.
Then, for any m1, . . . , mt and α1, . . . , αt, there are constants C and C ′ depend-
ing only on mi’s and αi’s such that the number of codewords of type [mα1

is C if O is a codeword, otherwise it is C ′.

Now we state several corollaries of Theorem 25.

p ((cid:0)p−1
Corollary 27. Let W be a codeword. Then there are 1
k (cid:1) + (p − 1)(−1)k)
codewords of type [1k], and also of type [−1k] with respect to W .
Proof. It suﬃces to consider the “shifted” tiling TW = {Vq−1 + l, l ∈ L − W},
and {Vq−1 + l, l ∈ −L}, a reﬂection of tiling T }.
Corollary 28. For any m, k ≤ q− 1, the number of codewords of type [mk] with
respect to W , equals the number of codewords of type [1k] with respect to W .

xim

k

1 xim

2 ··· xim

Proof. It is suﬃcient to prove the statement only for W = O. To determine
the number of codewords of type [mk] we need to calculate T (e(m)
), where
e(m)
. Thus, e(1)
k = ek as deﬁned above. It is not
diﬃcult to see that after substituting yi = xm
i one can apply verbatim the proof
of Theorem 25.

k = Pi1<···<ik
Substituting k = q − 1, we get:
Corollary 29. For each word W , W is a codeword if and only if W±(1, 1, . . . , 1)
is a codeword as well.

k

Applying Corollary 12 we have

Corollary 30. Let W be a codeword. Then, for any a ≤ q − 1, there is no
codeword of type [a1] and of type [a1,−a1] with respect to W .
Finally,

Corollary 31. Let W be a codeword. Then there are n = q−1

where I = (1, 1, . . . , 1).

Proof. By Theorem 25, n = q−1
2 . To see the other part of the statement it
suﬃces to note that if two words Ui − W and Ui − W coincided in a coordinate
then the semi-crosses centered at Ui and Uj would not be disjoint.

Proof of Theorem 24. By Theorem 22 it is suﬃcient to prove that each tiling of
Zq−1 by translates of V = {0, e1, . . . , eq−1} is lattice. We start by introducing
additional notation and notions. We denote by I the word (1, 1, . . . , 1). For a
word W = (a1, a2, a3, . . . , aq−1), by π(W ) we mean the word obtained by the
shift of coordinates of W , i.e., π(W ) = (a2, a3, . . . , aq−1, a1); further we put
hWi := {W, π(W ), π2(W ), . . . , πq−2(W )}, the set of all shifts of W .

14

q = 2. Trivially, each tiling of Z1 by the tile V1 = {0, e1} is lattice.
q = 3. By Corollary 29, for all integers n, nI is a codeword, and from periodicity
of L, if W is a codeword then W + 3ne1 is a codeword as well. Thus, L contains
a lattice F generated by I and 3e1. However, F = L as

In what follows, there will be several statements formulated for a general
codeword W but we will prove them all without loss of generality only for
W = O. Further, we point out, that with respect to a cyclic property, it suﬃces
to prove statements given below only for one codeword from a set hV i.
q = 5. Let W be a codeword. By Corollary 31, there are two codewords A, B of
type [12], A + B = I, and two codewords C, D of type [−12], C + D = −I, with
respect to W ; we denote them by U +
2 (W ), respectively. To simplify
the proof, we assume without loss of generality that U +
2 (O) = h(1, 0, 1, 0)i.
There are 6 words of type [12], each of them covered by a codeword either of
type [12] or of type [12,−1]. Hence, as there are 2 codewords of type [12], there
have to be 4 codewords of type [12,−1], we denote them by U +
3 (W ); the same is
true for codewords of type [−12, 1], they will be denoted U −
3 (W ). The following
straightforward claim will be applied repeatedly in the proof.

2 (W ) and U −

2 (W ) determines uniquely the other codeword
3 (W ),
3 (W ). The same is true for the

2 (W ), and one codeword in U +

2 (W ). In addition, codewords in U +

Claim 1. Each codeword in U +
in U +
determine uniquely the other codewords in U +
“−” part.
For example, if U +
U +
3 (O) = h(1, 1, 0,−1)i. Thus, one codeword in U +
way the set U +
3 (O).
Claim 2. Let W be a codeword. Then, for each A ∈ U +

2 (O) = h(1, 0, 1, 0)i, then we have U +

2 (W ),

3 (O) = h(1, 1,−1, 0)i or
3 (O) determines in a unique

U +
2 (W + A) = U +

2 (W ).

Proof of Claim 2. Let W = O without loss of generality. As I is a codeword, it
means that (0, 1, 0, 1) ∈ U +
2 (O).
Further, since h(1, 0, 1, 0)i − I = −h(1, 0, 1, 0)i are codewords, we get

2 ((1, 0, 1, 0)), and therefore U +

2 ((1, 0, 1, 0)) = U +

which implies

2 (O) = −U +
U −

2 (O),

U −
2 (W + A) = U −

2 (W ), for any codeword A ∈ U −

2 (W ).

It follows that U +

2 (W ).

3 (O).

Then, by a straightforward induction, tiling T contains a lattice generated by
h(1, 0, 1, 0)i. Now we will show that T contains a lattice generated by h(1, 0, 1, 0)i
and any codeword in U +
3 (O) = −U +
Claim 3. U −

3 (O) = h(1, 1,−1, 0)i, and U −

Proof of Claim 4. Let W = O. Assume without loss of generality that U +
3 (O) =
h(1, 1,−1, 0)i. It is suﬃcient to notice that B + C − I is a codeword for each
B ∈ h(1, 0, 1, 0)i, and C ∈ h(1, 1,−1, 0)i.

3 (W ).

2 (W ) = h(1, 0, 1, 0)i. Then U +

In view of Claim 3, Claim 4 is true also for the “−” part.
Claim 5. Let U +

Proof of Claim 5. Assume that U +

out loss of generality that U +
3 ((1, 1,−1, 0)) =
h(1, 1, 0,−1)i. Then (1, 1,−1, 0) + (0,−1, 1, 1) = (1, 0, 0, 1) would be a code-
word, a contradiction since U +

3 (O) for an A ∈ U +
3 (O) = h(1, 1,−1, 0)i, and U +
2 (W ) = h(1, 0, 1, 0)i.

3 (W + A) = U +

3 (A) 6= U +

3 (W ) for any

As above, by Claim 3, Claim 5 is true also for the “−” part. Assume without
loss of generality that h(1, 1,−1, 0)i are codewords. Let n, m, k be integers.
By Claim 2, W = n(1, 0, 1, 0) + m(0, 1, 0, 1) is a codeword, and U ±
2 (W ) =
±h(1, 0, 1, 0)i. By Claim 4 and Claim 5, and a straightforward induction, W +
k(1, 1,−1, 0) is a codeword. Finally, taking into account that T is periodic with
5e1, we have that T contains a lattice R generated by h(1, 0, 1, 0)i, (1, 1,−1, 0),
and 5e1. The determinant of the matrix whose rows are the given four vectors
equals ±5, thus R contains all codewords of T . The proof for q = 5 is complete.
q = 7. By Theorem 25, for each codeword W there are 3 codewords of type [12]
and 2 codewords of type [13] with respect to W ; we denote these codewords by
U2(W ) and U3(W ), respectively.

16

Lemma 32. Let W be a codeword. Then

XV ∈U2(W )

V = XZ∈U3(W )

Z = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1).

Proof of Lemma. Let W = O. The statement is obvious for U2(W ). To show
it for U3(W ), we need in fact to prove that the two codewords Z1 and Z2 of
type [13] do not coincide in any coordinate. Z1 and Z2 cannot coincide in two
coordinates, otherwise the two semi-crosses centered at Z1 and Z2 would have
a non-empty intersection. So assume by contradiction that Z1 and Z2 coincide
in exactly one coordinate. Let, without loss of generality, Z1 = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)
and Z2 = (1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1). Now we show that

Claim 6. For each codeword W there are

codewords has the i-th coordinate equal to 0;

(i) 3 codewords of type [14]; for each 1 ≤ i ≤ 6, exactly one of the three
(ii) 6 codewords of type [14,−11] with respect to W . No two of these code-

words coincide in the coordinate whose value is −1.

Proof of Claim 6. Let W = 0.

(i) There is no codeword of type [15]. So all 6 words of this type are covered

by the codewords of type [14], the statement follows.

(ii) There are 15 words of type [14]; 3 of them are codewords, 6 of them
are covered by codewords of type [13] (regardless of in how many coordi-
nates Z1 and Z2 might coincide). Thus the remaining 6 words have to be
covered by codewords of type [14,−11]. Clearly, each codeword of type
[14,−11] covers only one word of type [14], thus there are 6 codewords of
type [14,−11]. Two semi-crosses centered at codewords of type [14,−11]
coinciding in the coordinate whose value is −1 would have a non-empty
intersection.

Now we are ready to ﬁnish the proof of our lemma. Let Z be a codeword of
type [14] whose second coordinate equals 0. The three codewords Z, Z1, and
Z2 cover all 5 words of type [14] whose second coordinate equals to 0. However,
by Claim 6, there is a codeword W of type [14,−11] whose second coordinate
equals −1. Clearly, W also covers a word of type [14] whose second coordinate
is 0, a contradiction. The proof is complete.

We note that any codeword of type [13] coincides with each codeword of
type [12] in precisely one coordinate. We will assume without loss of generality
that U2(O) = h(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)i, and U3(O) = h(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)i. Also we set,
B1 = (1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0), and B2 = π(B1), B3 = π2(B2).

Claim 7. Let W be a codeword. Then U2(W + A) = U2(W ) for all A ∈
In particular, the 3 codewords of type [14] are h(0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1)i, and
U2(W ).
the 3 codewords of type [22] are 2 · U2(O) = h(2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0)i. Further, tiling T
contains a lattice generated by codewords h(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)i.

17

Proof of Claim 7. Let W = O. To prove the statement it suﬃces to show that
the 3 codewords of type [14] are h(0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1)i.

By Corollary 28, there are 3 codewords of type [22]. We show that these
codewords are 2 · h(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)i = h(2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0)i. Assume that there is
codeword W of type [22] such that W /∈ h(2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0)i. Let V be a codeword of
type [12,−1] such that V and 1
2 W coincide in two coordinates. Then W −V = Z
is of type [13]. Hence, Z ∈ U3(V ), and Z ′ = I − Z ∈ U3(V ) as well. Thus,
V + Z ′ is a codeword, and it is of type [15,−1]. This is a contradiction as I is
a codeword. Therefore, Bi ∈ U2(Bi), i = 1, 2, 3. Let C2, C3 be the other two
codewords in U2(B1). Then C2 + C3 = (0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1) and B1 + Ci, i = 2, 3,
are codewords of type [14]. By Claim 6, (0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1) has to be a codeword.
However, this means that B2 ∈ U2(B3), and therefore also B1 ∈ U2(B3); that
is, U2(B3) = U2(O). By the same argument we get U2(Bi) = U2(O) for i = 2, 3.
But then (1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1) is a codeword, a contradiction. The proof of the ﬁrst
part is complete. Clearly, as U2(B1) = U2(O), h(1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0)i are the three
codewords of type [14]. The ﬁnal part of the proof follows by a straightforward
induction.

Let U2(W ) = h(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)i, and U3(W ) = h(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)i. Then the
three codewords of type [14] are h(1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0)i. Further, the 6 codewords of
type [14,−11] with respect to W are either h(1, 1, 1, 1,−1, 0)i, or h(1, 1, 1, 1, 0,−1)i.
We denote these codewords by U4(W ).
Claim 8. Let W be a codeword, U2(W ) = h(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)i, and U3(W ) =
h(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)i. If U4(W ) = h(1, 1, 1, 1,−1, 0)i, then the 6 codewords of type
[13,−1] are h(1, 1, 1, 0, 0,−1)i, and the 12 codewords of type [12,−11] are h(1, 1, 0,−1, 0, 0)i,
and h(1,−1, 1, 0, 0, 0)i. If U4(W ) = h(1, 1, 1, 1, 0,−1)i, then the 6 codewords of
type [13,−1] are h(1, 1, 1,−1, 0, 0)i, and the 12 codewords of type [12,−11] are
h(1, 1, 0, 0,−1, 0)i, and h(1,−1, 1, 0, 0, 0)i.
Proof of Claim 8. Let W = O. The six words of type [14] that are covered
by codewords of type [14,−1] are h(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0)i. By Claim 6, the codewords
of type [14,−1] are either h(1, 1, 1, 1,−1, 0)i or h(1, 1, 1, 1, 0,−1)i. Assume the
former case. The six words of type [13] that are covered by codewords of type
[13,−1] are h(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)i. Thus, the codewords of type [13,−1] have to be
h(1, 1, 1, 0, 0,−1)i, otherwise the semi-crosses centered at h(1, 1, 1, 1,−1, 0)i and
at codewords of type [13,−1] would not be disjoint. Finally, the 12 words
of type [12] covered by codewords of type [12,−1] are h(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)i and
h(1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)i. Because of codewords h(1, 1, 1, 0, 0,−1)i, the codewords cover-
ing words h(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)i and h(1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0)i are the codewords h(1, 1, x, y, 0, 0)i
and h(1, z, 1, v, w, 0)i, where one of x, y is −1 and the other equals 0, also one
of z, v, w equals −1, the other two are 0’s. With respect to (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0), it is
w = 0. If x = −1, then semi-crosses h(1, 1, x, y, 0, 0)i and h(1, z, 1, v, 0, 0)i would
intersect. For the same reason it is impossible to have y = v = −1. Using the
same ideas one can show the other part of the claim for the latter case.

18

Claim 9. If W is a codeword described in Claim 8, then −W is a codeword as
well.

Proof of Claim 9. We know that if W is a codeword then W ± I as also a
codeword. Hence,

h(1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0)i − I = −h(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)i = −U2(W )

are codewords. Further,

U3(W ) − I = −h(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)i = −U3(W )

are codewords as well. Applying Claim 8 to −U2(W ) and −U3(W ) we need
only to show that if h(1, 1, 1, 1,−1, 0)i (h(1, 1, 1, 1, 0,−1)i) are codewords, then
−h(1, 1, 1, 1,−1, 0)i, (−h(1, 1, 1, 1, 0,−1)i) are again codewords. Assume by con-
tradiction that h(1, 1, 1, 1,−1, 0)i and −h(1, 1, 1, 1, 0,−1)i are codewords. Then,
by Claim 8, h(1, 1, 1, 0, 0,−1)i and h(−1,−1,−1, 1, 0, 0)i are codewords as well.
Set Z = (1, 1, 1, 0, 0,−1), and U = (−1,−1, 1, 0, 0,−1). Then Z−U = (2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0)
is a codeword of type [22] with respect to U . This in turn implies, see Claim 7,
that (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) is a codeword of type [12] with respect to U , that is, U +
(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0,−1) is a codeword. However, this contradicts
Corollary 29. The proof is complete.

Claim 10. U3(W + B) = U3(W ) for all B ∈ U2(W ), and U2(W + B) = U2(W )
for all B ∈ U3(W ).
Proof of Claim 10. Let W = O. It suﬃces to note that for each U ∈ h(1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)i,
and each Z ∈ h(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)i, U + Z − I is a codeword.

Claim 11. U3(W + B) = U3(W ) for all B ∈ U3(W ).
Proof of Claim 11. Let W = O. Assume by contradiction that U3(B) 6= U3(O).
Then there is C in U3(B) such that B4 = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0) coincides with C only
in one coordinate. This in turn implies that B4 + C − I is of type [1,−1], a
contradiction.

By Claim 8, 10, and 11 we have that the tiling T contains a lattice generated
by h(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)i and (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0).
Claim 12. Let W be a codeword. Then U2(W + B) = U2(W ), U3(W + B) =
U2(W ), and U4(W + B) = U4(W ) for all B ∈ U4(W ).
Proof of Claim 12. As this proof uses the same techniques as presented above
we leave it for the reader.

With Claim 12 in hands we know that T contains a lattice generated by
h(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)i, (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0), and a vector from U4(W ), say either (1, 1, 1, 1,−1, 0)
or (1, 1, 1, 1, 0,−1). In addition, T is periodic with 7e1. The determinant of a
matrix whose rows are these 7 vectors is ±7; that is, the lattice contains all
codewords of T .

As an immediate consequence of Theorem 18 we get:

Corollary 33. let V = {0, v1, . . . , vq−1} ⊂ Zn of a prime size q ≤ 7 tiles Zn
by translates, and {v1, . . . , vq−1} generate Zn. Then there is a unique tiling, up
to a congruency, of Znby V and this tiling is lattice. In particular, for a prime
q ≤ 7, there is a unique tiling, up to a congruency, of Zq−1 by semi-crosses.
Remark 34. We note that a computer aided proof that there is only one tiling
of Z4 by semi-crosses is provided in [13] without relating the result to other tiles
of size 5.

We note that in the proof of the above theorem we have not used explicitly the
fact that q is a prime. We believe that the property distinguishing tilings by
semi-crosses of prime size from tilings by semi-crosses of composite size is that
of being cyclic. We recall that a tiling T = {V + l; l ∈ L} is called cyclic if, for
each codeword l,

l ∈ L ⇒ hli ⊂ L ;

that is, if for any codeword, also all its shifts are codewords. In this regard, at

the very end of the paper we show that:

Claim 35. For each prime q > 2, there is a cyclic tiling of Zq−1 by semi-crosses.

Proof. For a primitive element t of the multiplicative group Z∗
homomorphism φ : Zq−1 → Zq by

q we deﬁne a

φ(ei) = ti−1 for i = 1, . . . , q − 1.

Then T = {Vq−1 + l; l ∈ L = ker(φ)} is a lattice tiling of Zq−1 by semi-crosses.
Let a = (a1, . . . , aq−1) ∈ L. Then

a1t0 + a2t1 + ··· + aq−1tq−2 ≡ 0 (mod q)

Multiplying the congruence by tk yields

a1t0+k + a2t1+k + ··· + aq−1tq−2+k ≡ 0 (mod q);

that is πk(a), the shift of a by k to the right, is a codeword as well.
