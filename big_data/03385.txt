Abstract:
New physics beyond the standard model (SM) can be formulated via dimension-6 eﬀective
operators, whose coeﬃcients (cutoﬀs) characterize the scales of new physics. We study the
probe of new physics scales from the electroweak precision observables (EWPO) and the
Higgs observables (HO) at the future e+e− Higgs Factory (such as CEPC). To optimize
constraints of new physics from all available observables, we establish a scheme-independent
approach. With this formulation, we treat the SM electroweak parameters and the coef-
ﬁcients of dimension-6 operators on equal footing, which can be ﬁtted simultaneously by
the same χ2 function. As deviations from the SM are generally small, we can expand the
new physics parameters up to linear order and perform an analytical χ2 ﬁt to derive the
potential reach of the new physics scales. We ﬁnd that the HO (from both Higgs produnc-
tion and decay rates) can probe the new physics scales up to 10 TeV (and to 40 TeV for the
case of gluon-involved operator Og), and including the EWPO can further push the limit
up to 35 TeV. From this prospect, we demonstrate that the Z-pole measurements in the
early phase of a Higgs Factory can be as important as the Higgs observables. These indirect
probes of new physics scales at the Higgs Factory can mainly cover the energy range to be
explored by the next generation hadron colliders of pp (50 − 100 TeV), such as the SPPC
and FCC-hh.

Introduction

The LHC discovery [1] of a light Higgs boson h(125GeV) [2] has completed the particle
spectrum of the standard model (SM) of particle physics. This culminates the searches
that lasted for decades [3]. Although the new physics has not yet been established so
far, there are already strong motivations for going beyond the SM, including the observed
neutrino oscillations and cosmic baryon asymmetry, and evidences for the dark matter and
inﬂation. Since 2012, the particle physics has come to a turning point at which the precision
Higgs measurements have become an important task for seeking clues to the new physics
discovery [4].

We should stress that the SM is not merely a collection of various observed particles
(fermions and bosons). The completion of the SM particle spectrum does not mean the
completion of the SM itself until all SM interaction forces could be ﬁrmly measured. In
fact, the SM consists of three fundamental gauge forces as its key ingredients, the elec-
tromagnetic force, the weak force, and the strong force, which are mediated by the spin-1
gauge bosons, the photon (Aµ), the weak bosons (W ±
µ), respec-
tively. Furthermore, the spin-0 Higgs boson h(125GeV) is not merely another particle in

µ), and the gluons (Ga

the SM, because it joins three types of fundamental forces: (i) the gauge forces mediated
by the spin-1 weak gauge bosons (W, Z); (ii) the Yukawa forces with fermions mediated by
the spin-0 Higgs boson h; (iii) and the cubic and quartic Higgs self-interactions1 h3 and
h4 . Among these, the type-(ii) and type-(iii) are new forces solely mediated by the Higgs
boson itself.2 They are largely untested so far, and provide the most likely places to encode
new physics beyond the SM. Even for the type-(i) force, the LHC could only measure the
hW W and hZZ couplings down to 20% level. It should be stressed that the discovery of the
SM is not complete until all three types of Higgs-involved forces are fully tested by direct
measurements.

The existence of such a spin-0 Higgs boson h(125GeV) is truly profound. This is
because h is responsible for mass-generations for all SM particles, the spin-1 weak gauge

bosons and the spin- 1
Note that the observed unnaturally large hierarchies among the quark and lepton masses
correspond to the same hierarchies among the Higgs Yukawa couplings. Except that the
top quark Yukawa coupling is naturally around yt (cid:39) 1 , all other Yukawa couplings are
unnaturally small and thus call for new physics. The upper bounds on the new physics scales
associated with all SM fermion mass-generations vary within the range of 3.5 − 107 TeV,
from the top quark to the electron [6]. This range of scales are mainly beyond the reach of
the LHC. The Higgs boson h also generates a physical mass Mh for itself via its type-(iii)
self-interaction force after spontaneous symmetry breaking, but this mass is not protected
against radiative corrections, causing the naturalness problem [7]. Furthermore, this Higgs
boson could serve as the inﬂaton to drive the required exponential expansion of the early
universe [8], and may also be connected to dark matter [9]. But, the SM Higgs potential
suﬀers instability at scales well below the Planck mass [10] and calls for new physics at or
beyond the TeV scale [11].

The above physics considerations strongly motivate the next generation high energy
colliders beyond the LHC. Because of the profound implications of the newly discovered
light Higgs boson h(125GeV),
it is natural to ﬁrst precisely measure its properties at an
e+e− Higgs factory and ﬁnd compelling clues to the new physics. There are three major
proposals on the market, the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) [12], the Future
Circular Collider (FCC-ee) [13], and the International Linear Collider (ILC) [14]. All three
proposed colliders can run at
s = 250 GeV by producing Higgs boson via Higgsstrahlung
(e+e−→ Zh) and W W fusion (e+e−→ ν ¯νh). By measuring decay products of the ﬁnal state
Z boson in the Higgsstrahlung process, the Higgs signal can be extracted with the aid of
recoil mass reconstruction technique [15]. This allows model-independent measurement of
Higgs decay branching fractions down to percentage level. The CEPC runs at the collision
energy of 250GeV with 5 ab−1 integrated luminosity can produce about 1 million Higgs
bosons. With these, most Higgs decay channels can be precisely measured with sizable
events. Hence, such a Higgs factory will be an ideal place to probe the new physics deviations

√

1Note that only the spin-0 Higgs boson can have strict self-interaction force, while other particles (such
as the spin-1 Non-Abelian gauge bosons or the spin-2 gravitons) cannot, because any interaction vertex of
these spin-1 or spin-2 particles always involves diﬀerent charges or helicities, and thus there is no spin-1 or
spin-2 identical particles strictly interact with themselves [5].

2No other gauge bosons or fermions have these features (cf. also footnote-1). Such a spin-0 scalar Higgs
boson holds a truly unique position in the structure of the SM, and is far from being fully tested and
understood. In this sense, we could fairly regard, the Higgs boson itself is new physics.

3The masses of active neutrinos can be naturally generated via seesaw mechanism after including the

right-handed singlet neutrinos, which still invokes Yukawa interactions with the Higgs boson.

via Higgs production and decays, as well as other precision measurements.4

In this work, we will study the probe of new physics scales at the e+e− Higgs Factory,
with CEPC as a concrete example. We parametrize the new physics associated with the
light Higgs boson h(125GeV) via model-independent dimension-6 eﬀective operators, which
involve the SM Higgs doublet H. We will establish a scheme-independent approach to
optimize the constraints of new physics from all available observables, including both the
electroweak precision observables (EWPO) and the Higgs observables (HO). With this
formulation, we treat the SM electroweak parameters and the coeﬃcients of dimension-6
operators on equal footing for a combined analysis, which can be ﬁtted simultaneously by the
same χ2 function. Since deviations from the SM are generally small, we can expand the new
physics parameters up to linear order and perform an analytical χ2 ﬁt to derive the potential
reach of the new physics scales. We will demonstrate that the Z-pole measurements in the
early phase of a Higgs Factory can be as important as the Higgs observables. Some aspects
of the eﬀects of these operators on Higgsstrahlung production were studied before for e+e−
colliders at various energies and with diﬀerent focuses [18], which usually did not cover
a complete list of these operators, and also did not consider the interplay with precision
observables. A recent paper [19] studied the probe of these operators at a Higgs factory
in the Z-scheme by taking the three most precisely measured electrowaek observables (the
ﬁne structure constant α, the Fermi constant GF , and the Z boson mass MZ) as ﬁxed
inputs. The extended studies considered the existing electroweak precision observables at
LEP [20], and the measurements at a future Higgs Factory [21]. But a full investigation of
the combined analysis of all the HO and EWPO would be highly beneﬁcial.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we ﬁrst establish a scheme-independent
approach with linear expansion, which puts both dimension-6 operators and electroweak
parameters on equal footing for ﬁtting the data. The Sec. 3 analyzes the CP-conserving
dimension-6 eﬀective operators that involve the SM Higgs doublet H, and summarizes
their eﬀects on the ﬁeld redeﬁnition, particle masses, and interaction vertices, along with
Appendix A on kinetic mixing of gauge bosons. With these, in Sec. 4, we analyze the Higgs
and precision observables to deduce the reach of new physics scales that can be probed
at the e+e− Higgs factory. Finally, we conclude in Sec. 5. We present our method of the
analytic linear χ2 ﬁt in Appendix B. As an application of this analytical method, we present
the precision reach of measuring the SM Higgs couplings at the CEPC in Appendix C.

2 Scheme-Independent Approach for Precision Observables

The electroweak sector of SM contains three basic parameters, the SU (2)L gauge coupling
g , the U (1)Y gauge coupling g(cid:48), and the Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV) v. They
can be determined by the existing precision tests, especially the four most precisely mea-
sured observables: the Z boson mass MZ, the W boson mass MW , the Fermi constant GF ,
and the ﬁne structure constant α . Fixing the electroweak (EW) parameters (g, g(cid:48), v) needs
only three observables as inputs. In common practice, one usually adopts either Z-scheme
(MZ, GF , α) or W -scheme (MZ, MW , α) to ﬁx the values of (g, g(cid:48), v). Picking up which
scheme is thus a matter of choice. In addition, the numerical analysis with this approach
could only implement the central values of these electroweak observables without including
4Probing the Higgs self-interactions is much harder at such a Higgs factory [16]. But the Higgs self-
coupling can be measured via Higgs pair productions to good precision [17] at the future circular hadron
colliders pp(100TeV) [12][13].

the associated uncertainties. This means, some information from experimental measure-
ments is discarded and the outcome turns out to be scheme-dependent.
In the present
study, we try to incorporate all precision observables, so we can realize more sensitive
probe of the new physics scales of the dimension-6 operators by using all the information
available from experiments. The improvement of this new method is minor for the current
precision data, but will become signiﬁcant for analyzing the future precision measurements
at the Higgs factory.

Our new strategy is to employ all the precision observables, including both their central
values and uncertainties, to constrain the independent EW parameters (g, g(cid:48), v). The values
of (g, g(cid:48), v) are determined by ﬁtting the data altogether with eﬀective operator coeﬃcients,
rather than being expressed as functions of central values of 3 input parameters chosen for
the Z-scheme or W -scheme.
In this way, we can utlize all the most precisely measured
precision EW observables (MZ, MW , GF , α) altogether with any other relevant observables
in our χ2 ﬁt. We no longer need to invoke the concept of scheme or input parameters. Our
analysis only involves model (ﬁtting) parameters and experimental data. The basic EW
parameters and the coupling coeﬃcients [cf. (3.1)] can be treated equally as the ﬁtting
parameters. This will just add three more ﬁtting parameters, but all precision observables
can be equally used to constrain the dimension-6 operators.

An observable contains the SM contribution, expressed in terms of the EW parameters,
plus the corrections from new physics. When ﬁtting experimental measurements, the SM
contribution and new physics contribution vary simultaneously. So long as the precision
measurements are included, the EW parameters are constrained with small uncertainties.
On the other hand, the new physics contribution is expected to be small. Thus, it is well
justiﬁed that both the EW parameters and the eﬀective operator coeﬃcients have only
small shifts from their reference values. We can expand observables as linear combinations
of the shifts. In consequence, we can perform analytic χ2 ﬁt as elaborated in B.

To implement the two features above, we treat all model-parameters (EW parameter
and eﬀective operator coeﬃcients) on equal footing and make analytic χ2 ﬁt for small
variations. We lay out the procedure as follows. First, we split each EW parameter as a
sum of the reference value, acting as starting point for the χ2 ﬁt, and the shift from it,

f (sm) ≡ f (r) + δf (cid:39) f (r)

,

(2.1)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

δf

where f (sm) is the SM prediction, f (r) the reference value, and δf the shift between them.
Any observable X can then be expanded in a similar way,

X ≡ X(cid:74)f (sm)(cid:75) + δX = X(cid:74)f (r)(cid:75) + X(cid:48)(cid:74)f(cid:75)δf + δX ≡ X (r) + (cid:102)δX,

where X(cid:74)f(cid:75) is a functional form of the observable in terms of the EW parameters, while the
value f (r) of the EW parameters, the observable also has a reference value X (r)≡ X(cid:74)f (r)(cid:75) .

new physics contribution (which can arise from the relevant dimension-6 operators [22, 23]
for instance) and SM loop corrections are included in δX . Corresponding to the reference

(2.2)

Its shift from reference value is then combined into

(cid:102)δX ≡ X(cid:48)(cid:74)f(cid:75)δf + δX ,
where X(cid:48)(cid:74)f(cid:75) is a functional derivative with respect to f .

(2.3)

For the present study, we use (MZ, GF , α) as EW ﬁtting parameters which are equiv-
alent to using (g, g(cid:48), v), but have the beneﬁt of being direct physical observables. Each of
them contains a shift from its reference value,

The quantities (δMZ, δGF , δα) are the diﬀerences between the SM prediction and reference
value. Note that the SM prediction can be at either tree-level or loop-level, depending
on whether the loop-level correction needs to be taken into consideration. In either case,
the dependence on the electroweak parameter shifts remains the same since the SM loop
contribution is a constant term which can be added to the tree-level SM prediction. We
will give an explicit example for the case of W boson mass in Sec. 4.1, which justiﬁes that
(2.4) applies to either tree-level or loop-level analysis.

In principle, the reference point can take any value. This arbitrariness is then compen-
sated by the corresponding shift parameter, so their combination is not aﬀected. Nev-
ertheless, for our linear expansion and thus the analytic χ2 ﬁt to work, the reference
point should be close to the best-ﬁt value which is around the experimental central value.
When the reference value is ﬁxed to the experimental central value and if no parameter

is allowed to be freely adjusted, the shift quantity (cid:102)δX would vanish. For our choice of
vanishing ((cid:93)δMZ, (cid:103)δGF , (cid:102)δα) will reduce our scheme-independent approach to the commonly

(MZ, GF , α) as ﬁtting parameter, the three corresponding experimental constraints for

used Z-scheme.

3 New Physics from Dimension-6 Eﬀective Operators

The new physics eﬀects beyond the SM can be generally parametrized by the dimension-6
eﬀective operators [22, 23],

(cid:88)

(3.1)

If these new physics eﬀects are associated with Higgs boson, we expect a set of gauge-
invariant dimension-6 operators will appear in the low energy eﬀective theory, as summa-
rized in Table 1. We expect the associated cutoﬀ scale Λ/|cj| 1
2 to be around TeV scale or not
s = 240−250 GeV
far above it. Since the physical processes at an e+e− Higgs factory with
have energy scales well below the TeV scale, we see that the eﬀective Lagrangian (3.1) pro-
vides a perfectly valid low energy formulation of the new physics eﬀects.

is the coeﬃcient of dimension-6 four-fermion operator itself), and consequently the other ob-
servables through parameter shift. If the underlying UV theory is known, these coeﬃcients
could be expressed in terms of the model parameters in principle. For the present study, we
follow the model-independent eﬀective theory approach and assume that the dimension-6
operators are independent of each other. We will use experimental measurements to esti-
mate the potential reach of indirectly probing the new physics scale Λ/|cj| 1
2 at the Higgs
factory (cf. Sec. 4). In this section, we ﬁrst analyze the contributions of these dimension-6
operators to the relevant Feynman vertices and physical observables.

3.1 New Physics via Kinetic Terms and Mass Terms

Before drawing Feynman diagrams and computing the relevant Higgs production cross
sections and decay width, it is necessary to check whether all the involved propagators take
the canonical form. If not, we need to make proper ﬁeld redeﬁnitions as summarized in
Appendix A. Such redeﬁnitions will modify the relevant mass terms and interaction vertices.
With the dimension-6 operators in Table 1, the kinetic terms of fermions remain the same
while boson ﬁelds, the Higgs ﬁeld h and the gauge bosons (W ±, Z0, A0), are aﬀected.

3.1.1 Higgs Field h
The operator OH in Table 1 could contribute a nonzero correction to the kinetic term of
the Higgs ﬁeld. Redeﬁning the Higgs ﬁeld,

h →

(3.2)

will absorb the deviation from the canonical form. It applies to every h that appears in
the Lagrangian and leads to a rescaling factor for any interaction vertex involving Higgs
ﬁeld(s). Each Higgs ﬁeld h receives a rescaling factor Zh, and Higgs mass term receives a
h.

3.1.3 Neutral Gauge Bosons

The case of neutral gauge bosons is a little bit more complicated since both kinetic term
and mass term are 2 × 2 matrices. From the dimension-6 operators (OW W ,OBB,OW B)
in Table 1, we derive corrections to the kinetic term, I∂2 → K∂2 ≡ (I + δK), with the
explicit form of δK given in (A.12). The neutral Z and A gauge bosons need to be not only
redeﬁned but also diagonalized as we elaborate in Appendix A.2,

(δZA, δZZ, δZX ) can be read oﬀ from (3.5). Note that kinetic mixing can introduce not
only ﬁeld redeﬁnition (δZA, δZZ) to both A and Z, but also equal correction δZX to the
left- and right-handed currents of the Z boson from the electromagnetic current as shown
in the last line.

3.2 New Physics via Interaction Vertices

The new physics parameters of the dimension-6 operators can aﬀect the interaction vertices
in three ways. First, they can give direct contributions to the existing vertex, sometimes
with a diﬀerent tensor structure such as the case of ZZh coupling. Second, the ﬁeld
redeﬁnition can introduce an overall rescaling factor of the relevant vertex that contains
the corresponding ﬁeld. Finally, the shifts of electroweak parameters from their reference
values can aﬀect the existing vertex through zeroth order correlations.
In addition, the
dimension-6 operators may introduce some new vertices, such as the trilinear vertex AZh,
and other quartic interactions Zhψ ¯ψ and W h(cid:96)ν .

hand, the second term comes from the ﬁeld redeﬁnition of the Z gauge boson, rendering it
proportional to the SM prediction of gL and gR, respectively. Finally, from the zeroth-order
coupling, extra correction can appear through parameter shift. Here we show the correction
to the coupling with charged leptons,

4 Probing New Physics Scales of Dimension-6 Operators

The dimension-6 operators in Table 1 can contribute to a wide range of physical observables,
including the electroweak precision observables (EWPO) and the Higgs observables (HO)
at Higgs Factory. Using the scheme-independent approach, we can utilize all of them to
constrain the dimension-6 operators. Both the EWPO and HO are sensitive probes of new
physics at high energy [20, 21, 24]. In Sec. 4.1 and Sec. 4.2, we ﬁrst derive the contributions
of dimension-6 operators to precision observables (α, GF , MZ, MW ) and Higgs observables
(among which two production cross sections σ(Zh) and σ(hν ¯ν) together with all decay
branching fractions can be measured). Then, we use these results, supplemented by the
existing precision measurements, to estimate the new physics scales that can be probed at
the CEPC in Sec. 4.3. We show the CEPC probe of these new physics scales can reach

– 11 –

up to 10 TeV. We continue to elaborate the role of precision observables in Sec. 4.4, and
demonstrate that the much more precisely measured (α, GF , MZ) eﬀectively ﬁx the three
EW parameters (g, g(cid:48), v), while the less precisely known MW helps to enhance the new
physics scale limit. The situation changes if MW can achieve comparable precision with
MZ at Higgs Factory as demonstrated in Sec. 4.5. We include more precision observables
at Z-pole running of the e+e− Higgs Factory in Sec. 4.6, and demonstrate that the limit on
the new physics scale can be further pushed up to around 30 TeV.

4.1 New Physics Contributions to Precision Observables

The existing best electroweak measurements include the weak gauge boson masses (MW , MZ),
the ﬁne-structure constant α, and the Fermi constant GF . Since they have already been
measured experimentally, it is necessary to consider both their central values and uncertain-
ties. To achieve this, we will include the SM loop-corrections (which are of the same order
as the dimension-6 operators) altogether. In this subsection, we ﬁrst show how the four pre-
cision observables (α, GF , MZ, MW ) are aﬀected by dimension-6 operators via their linear
combination and by the SM one-loop corrections via a constant term. Since we have four
observables versus three electroweak parameters, only one observable (MW ) will receive ex-
plicit SM loop correction if the other three (α, GF , MZ) are used to ﬁx the renormalization
conditions.

4.1.1 Fine-Structure Constant

The ﬁne-structure constant rescales by the photon ﬁeld redeﬁnition (3.5b), δα/α = 2δZA.
In addition, the parameter shift can also induce a correction. Altogether we have,

(4.1)

where ΛTeV ≡ Λ/TeV is the cutoﬀ scale in unit of TeV. Since the measurement of the
ﬁne-structure constant α is much more precise than any other observables, ﬁtting data

eﬀectively gives (cid:102)δα (cid:39) 0 . In this sense, the parameter shift δα is always connected to the

dimension-6 operator coeﬃcients. Nevertheless, we keep it free at the moment, to give a
general expression.

4.1.2 Fermi Constant
The Fermi constant is modiﬁed by the operators O(3)
LL in Table 1, where the latter
LL − c(3)
contributes a contact four-fermion vertex. Thus, we have δGF /GF = 2(v2/Λ2)(c(3)
L ) .
On the other hand, the eﬀect of the W ﬁeld redeﬁnition (3.3) is cancelled by the correction
(3.4) to its mass. Including the parameter shift, we deduce the total eﬀect,

4.1.3 Weak Gauge Boson Masses MW and MZ

Eqs.(3.4) and (3.6). Including the parameter shifts, we derive the total contributions,

for W and Z boson masses, respectively.

To make a consistent ﬁt with the existing data, it is necessary to included the SM ra-
diative corrections. The coeﬃcients of dimension-6 operators belong to the next-to-leading
(NLO) order. Up to the linear order of these NLO coeﬃcients, their contributions are in-
dependent of the SM loop corrections. Hence, the radiative correction can be computed
fully within the SM without involving new ultraviolet divergence. Among the four observ-
ables (α, GF , MZ, MW ), three of them can be used to ﬁx the renormalization conditions,
while the remaining one receives a constant correction term. For convenience, we follow
the convention in [25] by imposing renormalization conditions on the SM predictions of
(α, GF , MZ). Then, up to two-loop level, the W mass becomes [25],

(4.4)

The contribution of radiative corrections is included in ∆r , which is a function of elec-
troweak parameters, (α, GF , MZ), as well as Higgs mass Mh and the top quark mass Mt .
Since ∆r is already suppressed by loop factors, the eﬀect of varying its arguments is fairly
small and negligible up to the linear order. So ∆r can be treated as a constant. For
convenience, we deﬁne, ∆r ≡ ∆r1 + ∆r2, with ∆r1 (∆r2) denoting one-loop (two-loop)
contributions. For Mh = 125 GeV, the values of ∆r1 and ∆r2 can be inferred from the
Table 1 of [25], ∆r1 = 290.24×10−4 and ∆r2 = 72.99×10−4. The parameters (α, GF , MZ)
have been precisely measured, with precision much better than 10−4, while the radiative
corrections ∆r1 (cid:39) 4∆r2 = O(10−2). So it is a reasonable approximation to expand the
corrected W boson mass (4.4) up to the linear order of δα, δGF , δMZ, ∆r2, and the second
order of ∆r1,

The dependence on the shifts of electroweak parameters remains the same as in Eq. (3.4).
This is a general feature for any observables. Loop corrections do not change the dependence
on the shifts of electroweak parameters up to the linear order, and only contribute as
a constant term to the observables. By setting the reference values be the experimental
central values [30], α(r) = 7.2973525698×10−3, G(r)
Z =
91.1876 GeV, the W boson mass is predicted as MW = 80.385 GeV, which equals the
current experimental central value [30].

F = 1.1663787×10−5GeV−2, and M (r)

Two remarks are in order. First, in the above discussion we have imposed the renor-
malization conditions on (α, GF , MZ). But one is free to choose any other renormalization
conditions. The diﬀerence caused by using diﬀerent sets of renormalization conditions only

– 13 –

appears at higher order and thus can be ignored at the linear order analysis. Second, since
the dependence on parameter shifts (δα, δGF , δMZ) remains the same as going from tree-
level to one-loop level and the loop corrections only contribute a constant term, all the
expansions derived earlier will continue to hold.

4.2 New Physics Contributions to Higgs Observables at e+e− Colliders
At future e+e− colliders (such as the CEPC [12], FCC-ee [13], and ILC [14]), both produc-
tions and decays of the Higgs boson can be systematically studied. The Higgs boson with
mass Mh = 125 GeV is an ideal case for precision measurement of Higgs decay.
If Mh
would be either lighter or heavier than 125 GeV, the branching fractions would decrease
very fast for some decay channels ( h → W W, ZZ when h is too light, or h → γγ, gg, f ¯f
when h is too heavy). With 106 Higgs bosons to be collected at the CEPC, the Higgs
decay into all gauge bosons and fermions (b, c, τ, µ) can be measured. Both production
and decay rates can help to measure the Higgs coupling with other SM particles. The pro-
jected precision of measuring the SM Higgs couplings can be extracted as we will elaborate
in Appendix C. In this subsection, we derive the corrections to these processes from new
physics as parametrized by the dimension-6 operators in Table 1.

4.2.1 Higgsstrahlung: e+e−→ Zh
The Higgsstrahlung process e+e−→ Zh is the major production mode of the Higgs boson
s = 240 − 250 GeV. Its key
h (125GeV) at the Higgs Factory with center-of-mass energy
advantage is using the recoil mass distribution to make inclusive measurements, regardless
of what ﬁnal-states the Higgs boson decays into. The Higgs event rate can reach about 106
at CEPC (250 GeV) with an integrated luminosity of 5ab−1 [29]. From naive expectation,
this cross section could be measured to a precision level about δN/N ≈ 1/
N = 0.1% .
The recent CEPC detector simulations [12] give the estimated sensitivity, δσ/σ (cid:39) 0.51%,
at 68%C.L.

Figure 1. Feynman diagrams for the Higgsstrahlung process e+e− → Zh , which include contri-
butions of the dimension-6 operators in Table 1.

In Fig. 1, we summarize the relevant Feynman diagrams for e+e− → Zh production,
which include possible contributions of the dimension-6 operators in Table 1. Note that
only the ﬁrst diagram (a) has visible contributions, while other diagrams are negligible
due to the tiny Higgs-electron Yukawa coupling. This means that the Higgsstrahlung is
mainly mediated by s-channel gauge boson Zµ or Aµ. The new physics contributions come
from corrections to vertices Zψ ¯ψ (cf. Sec. 3.2.1), ZZh and AZh (cf. Sec. 3.2.2), as well
as Zhψ ¯ψ (cf. Sec. 3.2.3). Among these, the ﬁrst does not introduce new topology since it

contributes an overall factor δ(g2
R) to the SM cross section. This kind of contribution,
including ﬁeld redeﬁnitions which can contribute to the exiting vertices Zψ ¯ψ and ZZh, can
be treated as a simple rescaling. The others will either modify the tensor structure of the
existing vertex or introduce new vertex. We have systematically derived these contributions
for the present study. Since the ﬁnal state consists of only the on-shell particles Zh, we
can present the results in analytical form. We express the total cross section as a linear
combination of the SM contribution and the corrections of dimension-6 operators,

Comparing the above with the Eq.(3.10) of Ref. [19], we can see that our coeﬃcient
cT is much larger, due to the fact that we use scheme-independent approach instead of the
Z-scheme. The essential diﬀerence between these two approaches is due to the fact that in
result from our scheme-independent approach, we can simply set (cid:102)δα in (4.1), (cid:103)δGF in (4.2),
the Z-scheme, (α, GF , MZ) are ﬁxed to the measured values. To reproduce the Z-scheme
and (cid:93)δMZ in (4.3b) to be zero. In this way, the parameter shifts (δα, δGF , δMZ) can be
expressed in terms of dimension-6 operator coeﬃcients. Then, implement these expressions
of the parameter shifts into (4.7). After these operations, the coeﬃcient of cT becomes
−0.0397, and agrees well with the value −0.04 in Ref. [19].5

4.2.2 WW Fusion: e+e−→ ν ¯νh at 250 GeV and 350 GeV

The next production mode at the Higgs Factory is the W W fusion process as depicted in
Fig. 2. Since the cross section σ(ν ¯νh) at
s = 250 GeV is about 1/30 of σ(Zh) [29], the
σ(ν ¯νh) can be measured to a precision of 2.8% at the CEPC [12]. Although not as precise
as the cross section σ(Zh) of the Higgsstrahlung process, it can provide complementary
constraint on the Higgs coupling with W gauge bosons.

√

The new physics contributions can be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst kind is
the contribution to the vertex W W h with fusion topology, as studied in Sec. 3.2.2, which
shares the same Feynman diagram Fig. 2(a) as the SM contribution. Corresponding to the
coeﬃcients (cW

4.2.3 Higgs Decay into Z Boson Pair

For Higgs decay into the Z boson pair, at least one of them must be oﬀ-shell. The decay
width can be computed via the corresponding three-body decay process, h → ZZ∗ → Zf ¯f .
In addition, the double oﬀ-shell process h → Z∗Z∗ still contributes 25% of the partial width
and thus should be included via the four-body decay process, h → Z∗Z∗ → f1
¯f2 . We
compute the new physics contributions to the Higgs partial width by using FeynRules [26]
and MadGraph5 [27]. With these, we derive the following expression,

The CEPC detector simulations [12] show that this decay branching fraction can be mea-

4.2.4 Higgs Decay into W Boson Pair
The analysis of this process is similar to that of h → ZZ . We use FeynRules [26] and Mad-
Graph5 [27] to numerically compute the new physics contributions to h → W W ∗, W ∗W ∗
with 3-body and 4-body ﬁnal states. Altogether, we derive the contributions of the relevant

The branching fraction of h → W W can be measured with to 1.5% accuracy at the
CEPC [12]. Note that this channel is measured with better precision than h → ZZ . This
is because W is lighter than Z, and hence the W W channel has much larger branching
fraction than the ZZ channel. This diﬀerence in decay rates leads to diﬀerent precisions
which are mainly dominated by statistical ﬂuctuations.

4.2.5 Other Decay Channels

The remaining Higgs decay channels can be divided into two major classes: one with
fermionic decay products and the other with massless gauge bosons (photons or gluons).
The ﬁrst class occurs at tree-level, while the second class arises from one-loop level. Both
receive contributions from the Higgs ﬁeld redeﬁnition (3.2),

which is the only contribution to fermionic decays. The vertex f ¯f h comes from Yukawa
interaction which ﬂips chirality and is not aﬀected by either the dimension-6 operators
Table 1 or the EW parameters mentioned earlier. On the other hand, the decay into photons
has extra contributions. For fermion loop, it is aﬀected by the photon ﬁeld redeﬁnition
(3.5b) only. For bosonic W -loop, the new physics eﬀects come from W -mass correction (3.4)
and the photon ﬁeld redeﬁnition (3.5b). Note that the corrections of W -ﬁeld redeﬁnition to
the vertex and mass should cancel with each other. Since the EW parameters are involved
in bosonic decay, their shifts (δα, δGF , δMZ) should also appear. Note that h → gg only
has fermionic contributions.

Furthermore, dimension-6 operators induce direct coupling of the Higgs ﬁeld h with
photons or gluons, as shown in Eqs. (3.23) and (3.24), respectively. Thus, we derive the
following hAA and hgg couplings,

for ΓAA and Γgg , respectively. We note that the coeﬃcients of the last terms in both
(4.16a) and (4.16b) come from the interference between the SM prediction (4.15) and the
contribution (4.14) by dimension-6 operators. Although the SM predictions of h → gg
and h → γγ arise from loop-level and are expected to be of the same order as that of
dimension-6 operators, it is well justiﬁed to make expansion up to the linear terms of cg

– 18 –

and (cW W , cW B, cBB). This is because the current LHC data constrain the deviations from
the SM predictions within about 20% [28], and the future Higgs factory sensitivities to such
deviations are even much smaller (Table 2 in Sec. 4.3 and Fig. 5 in Appendix C). Hence, the
dimension-6 contributions can be well treated as small perturbations up to the linear order.

4.3 Probing the New Physics Scales at Higgs Factory

As discussed in Sec. 4.1 and Sec. 4.2, the dimension-6 eﬀective operators can modify both
EW precision observables (EWPO) and Higgs observables (HO). The EWPO have been
precisely measured at the LEP and Tevatron with high precision, while the HO can be
measured at the future Higgs factory under planning. Currently, there are three major
candidates of Higgs factory, CEPC [12], FCC-ee [13], and ILC [14], which can run at the
collision energies around 240 − 250 GeV. They can measure the Higgs production cross
sections and decay branching fractions with precisions at percentage level. This provides
important means to indirectly probe the scales of new physics. In the following, we study
how the EWPO and HO can probe the new physics scales via eﬀective dimension-6 operators
and the interplay with each other.

For convenience, we ﬁrst summarize the inputs for our analysis in Table 2. Since the
EWPO have already been measured, we list both their central values and relative errors.
These four observables are the most precisely measured ones. Especially, the ﬁne-structure
constant α is measured with unprecedented precision of δα/α = 3.29×10−10, much bet-
ter than all the others. According to its expression (4.1), one degrees of freedom can
be eﬀectively eliminated. This is also true for the Fermi constant GF , whose precision
δGF /GF = 5.14×10−7 is just next to that of α .

branching fraction is given by Brj ≡ Γj/Γ, where Γ ≡ (cid:80)

For the Higgs observables, Table 2 summarizes the estimated precisions at the CEPC
[12]. The production cross sections and branching fractions are independent of each other.
Nevertheless, the decay widths (4.11)-(4.12) for Higgs decays into ZZ and W W bosons
cannot be directly used to compare with the branching fraction precisions in Table 2. The
decay width for a speciﬁc channel competes with all other channels, so its corresponding
k Γk is the total decay width.
Each partial width can be expressed as Γj ≡ Γ(r)
j (1 + δΓj/Γj) with δΓj denoting the
deviation from the reference point. When expanded to linear order, the decay branching
fraction becomes,

The corrections to Higgs partial width aﬀect not only its own branching fraction, but also
all the others. Eq.(4.17) shows that for the branching ratio Brj, the contribution due to its
own channel is modulated by 1− Br(r)
, while other channels by the corresponding Br(r)
k .
Since the reference value is around the SM prediction, Br(r)
, the modulation is
essentially controlled by the SM predictions. In this way, the precision measurements of
branching fractions at CEPC will constrain the new physics scales via δΓj term and δΓk
term.

The observables in Table 2 can be used to constrain the electroweak parameters (δα, δGF , δMZ)

and the coeﬃcients of dimension-6 operators simultaneously. This can be achieved by the

Table 2. Inputs used to constrain the new physics scales of dimension-6 operators. The electroweak
precision observables in the ﬁrst four rows are taken from PDG [30], and the estimated precisions
of Higgs measurements are given by the CEPC detector simulations [12]. For the W W fusion cross
section σ[ν ¯νh]350GeV at
s = 350 GeV, we adopt the FCC-ee (TLEP) estimation [13] for illustra-
tion. For the “Measurements" entry, the number inside the parentheses stands for experimental
uncertainty.

where the theoretical predictions are functions of the ﬁtting parameters. The χ2 function
reaches its minimal value at the best ﬁt values of (δα, δGF , δMZ) and ci/Λ2. Using the
linear χ2 ﬁtting method shown in Appendix B, we can perform this ﬁt analytically. As
usual, for simplicity, we will consider only one dimension-6 eﬀective operator to be nonzero
during each ﬁt, and turn oﬀ the others. Thus, each ﬁt will deal with only four ﬁtting
parameters, (δα, δGF , δMZ) and one dimension-6 coeﬃcient ci/Λ2 .

In Fig. 3, we present the lower limit6 on the new physics scale of each dimension-6
operator by combining the existing electroweak precision measurements and future Higgs
√
measurements at the CEPC with
s = 250 GeV. We see that it can probe the new physics
scales up to about 12 TeV for O(3)
L at 95% C.L.
For the operators listed in Table 1, (OT , O(3)

L , OL,R, Og) are among the ﬁrst group
to be sensitively probed. Roughly speaking, they can be probed up to the new physics scales
(8−10) TeV. The second group consists (OH, OW W , OBB, OW B, OHW , O(3)
Lq ), which can be
probed up to the scales (2− 5) TeV. The others operators, (OHB, OLq, ORu, ORd), cannot
be probed above the 1 TeV scale. We note that the strong constraint on OT mainly comes
from the W boson mass MW . Including electroweak precision observables can signiﬁcantly

improve the probe of new physics scales, as we will fully elaborate in following Sec. 4.4 and
Sec. 4.5. The remaining constraints come from measuring the Higgs production and decay
rates, most of which is provided by the Higgsstrahlung process. For the gluonic operator
Og, its constraint is mainly given by the branching fraction of h → gg which is the only
relevant channel here. Although this is not the major Higgs decay channel, with the SM
prediction Br[gg] = 7.4%, it can put severe constraint on the scale of Og, as high as about
40 TeV (cf. Fig. 3). Since in the SM the Higgs coupling with gluons arises at one-loop level
and the dimension-6 operator Og contributes this coupling at tree-level, so the scale of Og
has to be high enough to suppress the deviation from the SM loop prediction.

LL, O(3)

Note that Fig. 3 contains more fermionic operators than listed in Table 1 since quark
and lepton can provide diﬀerent contributions. For a speciﬁc operator, we assume the
same operator coeﬃcient for the three generations of fermions. Consequently, each of the
operators involving left-handed fermions, (O(3)
L , OL), has two copies, one for leptons
and the other for quarks (with extra subscript “q”). On the other hand, the operator OR
that contains the right-handed fermions has three copies, one for charged leptons and the
other two for quarks (with subscripts “u” for up- and “d ” for down-type quarks). We can
see that leptonic operators are generally better constrained than those of quarks, since the
former can enter the most precisely measured Higgsstrahlung process, and the latter can
only be constrained by Higgs decays into W W and ZZ with limited branching ratios and
statistics. Although the Higgs decay mode h → b¯b has the largest branching fraction, it is
not connected to the fermionic operators shown in Table 1.

For clarity, in Table 3, we further present the numerical limits of Fig. 3 at both 95%
and 5σ conﬁdence levels. The 95% limit corresponds to the exclusion reach, while 5σ limits

gives the discovery reach. Since the results are obtained after reducing to one-dimensional
Gaussian distribution by marginalization (see Appendix B for detail), the value of the 5σ
reach on the new physics scale equals 39% of the corresponding 95% conﬁdence limit.
Note that these results are obtained with all Higgs observables to be measured at
√
s = 250 GeV. If the collision energy is upgraded to 350 GeV, the cross section of the W W
fusion process for Higgs production will increase signiﬁcantly. This can help to enhance
the sensitivity to the scale of OH by about 10%, as will be shown in the ﬁrst column of
Table 6, while the others remain the same.

4.4 Combining with Electroweak Precision Observables

For comparison, we note that the Z-scheme is adopted in the recent studies [19] and
[21], where the latter also invokes the W mass measurement at a Higgs factory. In this
scheme, not all the electroweak parameters, especially the most precisely measured ones
(α, GF , MZ), were included in their analysis. After incorporating the electroweak preci-
sion measurements, including also MW , the reach of new physics scales [21] becomes higher
than the one with the σ(Zh) constraints alone [19]. Although the MW measurement is
also used in [21], its interplay with MZ could not be studied within the Z-scheme. In this
subsection, we ﬁrst study the role of electroweak precision observables (EWPO) with the
current data [30]. We will further analyze the interplay of including a signiﬁcantly improved
MW measurement in Sec. 4.5.

Among the existing EWPO, the most precisely measured observables are α, GF , and
MZ, in the order of their relative uncertainties, as shown in Table 2. Even the least pre-
cise one, MZ, is much better measured than the other mass MW by about one order of
magnitude. This hierarchical structure in the relative uncertainties makes it appropriate to
treat (α, GF , MZ) as inputs to ﬁx the electroweak parameters (g, g(cid:48), v), and implement the
MW measurement into the ﬁt. As we discussed in Sec. 4.2.1, this is equivalent to setting

((cid:102)δα, (cid:103)δGF , (cid:93)δMZ) = 0 , from which (δα, δGF , δMZ) can be solved in terms of dimension-6

operator contributions. With these extra constraints (which is exactly the deﬁnition of
Z-scheme) implemented into (4.3a), we derive the W mass correction as,

In Table 4, the ﬁrst two rows are essentially Z-scheme approach with (α, GF , MZ) ﬁxed.
Here we see whether including the current MW measurement or not leads to signiﬁcant
diﬀerence. The change appears in the probed new physics scales of the four operators OT ,
OW B, O(3)
L , which are involved in the Z-scheme correction (4.19). For them, the
most signiﬁcant changes come from OT and OW B, since the reaches of the corresponding
new physics scales are enhanced by about a factor of 5 and 3, respectively. It shows that
for OT , the probe of its new physics scale is enhanced from 2.01 TeV to 10.6 TeV once MW
measurement is included. Setting the most precisely measured observables (α, GF , MZ) be
their experimental central values is equivalent to ﬁxing the electroweak observables. This
justiﬁes the Z-scheme approach when the precisions of (α, GF , MZ) are much higher than
the others. In Sec. 4.5, we will further analyze how the situation changes when the precisions
of MZ and MW measurements become comparable with each other.

4.5 Enhanced Sensitivity from CEPC Measurements of W/Z Masses

Lepton colliders such as the CEPC, FCC-ee and ILC can also make Z-pole measurements,
which are necessary for calibrations at the initial stage of running the machine. To make
full use of the Z-pole running, we can utilize the Z-pole data to further enhance the indirect
probe of new physics scales. The most signiﬁcant improvements include the weak boson
masses MZ and MW , as shown in Table 5 for the CEPC.
In comparison with the existing precision data shown in the ﬁrst block of Table 2, we
see that the uncertainties of MZ and MW can be further improved by a factor of 2 − 4

and 3 − 5, respectively. Since the constraints from current precision measurements are
already rather sensitive, we can expect more signiﬁcant enhancements by imposing the
CEPC measurements. A rough estimate leads us to expect that the sensitivity to new
physics scales could be doubled for operators OT and OL, reaching about 20 TeV.

In Table 6, we quantitatively analyze the impacts of imposing the Z-pole measurements
of MZ and MW at the CEPC. In the following analysis, we implement the relative errors
8.25×10−6 for MZ and 3.7×10−5 for MW as an illustration. Here, we see that the relative
errors of MZ and MW become comparable with each other. Including MZ alone makes
no signiﬁcant improvement. As we demonstrated in Table 4 and the related discussions,
the eﬀect of inputting the precision data MZ is to ﬁx one of the three electroweak pa-
rameters. Adding a better measurement of MZ would not change this picture, except to
further enhance it. On the other hand, imposing the CEPC measurement of MW alone can
signiﬁcantly improve the reach of new physics scales. This increases the sensitivities to the
scales of OT , OW B, OL, and O(3)
LL by about a factor of two, as shown in the third row of Ta-
ble 6. This result is consistent with what we have observed in Table 4. A new point is that
further imposing the CEPC measurement of MZ, after imposing MW , can introduce extra
improvement, although adding the CEPC measurement of MZ alone cannot. It demon-
strates the fact that when the precisions of MZ and MW are comparable with each other,
it is no longer appropriate to just pick up the three observables to ﬁx the three electroweak
variables. In other words, Z-scheme is a good approximation when the relative errors of
(α, GF , MZ) are all much smaller than the others. This appears no longer the case at future
lepton colliders. Here, we use the projected CEPC sensitivities to MZ and MW [12, 32] as
an illustration, and we have demonstrated that the present scheme-independent approach
is a more general-purpose method. In the conventional Z-scheme, MZ is commonly ﬁxed
to the experimental central value, so that the above improvement is impossible.

4.6 Enhancement from Z-Pole Observables at CEPC

In addition to the mass measurements of W and Z, CEPC can also measure the Z boson
lineshape at the Z-pole,
s = MZ . Currently, there are six observables that have been
simulated at CEPC [12, 32]. For convenience, we summarize them in Table 7, in the order
of their relative precisions.

In comparison with the existing measurements of LEP [30], CEPC can improve the
accuracy by at least one order of magnitude. The relative errors of the projected CEPC
measurements range from 1.8×10−3 to 10−4 as shown in Table 7. Although these relative
errors appear larger than those of the mass measurements for Z and W bosons, they are
still much smaller than the Higgs observables listed in Table 2. The most sensitive Higgs
observable at the CEPC is the production cross section σ(Zh) , which can be measured
to the precision of 0.51% . We can expect a much more improved constraint on the new
physics scales by using the Z-pole observables.

For this analysis, we derive the linearly expanded expressions for the new physics
contributions to the observables shown in Table 7. We use the analytical formulae of these
observables given in [33]. The new physics enters these observables through the parameter
shifts of the involved vertices between the Z boson and fermions. Since the deviations from
the SM predictions should be reasonably small, we can expand the parameter shifts up to
the linear order. For convenience, we present the expanded expressions as follows,

We see that these observables involve almost all dimension-6 operators in Table 1, except
the pure-Higgs operator OH and the gluon operator Og . The bosonic operators OT ,
OW W , OBB, and OW B can enter through the ﬁeld redeﬁnitions and mass shifts. Only the
operators OHB and OHW are not involved.

In Table 8, we present the sensitivity reaches by including the Z-pole observables sum-
marized in Table 7. The n-th row corresponds to the constraint from the (Z, W ) mass
measurements, the Higgs observables, and the existing EWPO, plus the ﬁrst n observables
in Table 7. The diﬀerence between the (n)-th and (n+1)-th rows represents the eﬀect of
the n-th Z-pole observable in Table 7. It is striking to see that the new physics scale can be
probed by Z-pole measurements to as high as 35 TeV for O(3)
L . This is another factor-2 en-
hancement over that of only including (Z, W ) mass measurements in Table 6. The relative

operators OW B, O(3)
LL, and OL also receive signiﬁcantly enhanced constraints. In contrast,
the operator OBB is not signiﬁcantly improved since its contribution to Z-pole observables
is highly suppressed. We present the ﬁnal results in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4 demonstrates that the Z-pole measurements are even more sensitive than the
Higgs observables for indirectly constraining the new physics scales of eﬀective dimension-
6 operators. This is mainly because of the huge event number that can be produced at
the Z-pole resonance. We see that running the future e+e− collider at Z-pole is beyond
the technical purpose of the machine calibration. Our study shows that it is worth of
running the collider at Z-pole for a longer time. Or, after running the Higgs factory at
Higgsstrahlung energy (240 − 250 GeV), it is invaluable to return to the Z-pole running for
a period and thus ensure the no-lose probe of new physics.

5 Conclusions

The LHC Higgs discovery in 2012 led particle physics to a turning point at which the
precision Higgs measurements have become an important task for seeking clues to the new
physics discovery. A future Higgs factory (like the proposed e+e− colliders CEPC, FCC-ee,
and ILC) can provide such precision Higgs measurements.

In this work, we studied the new physics scales that a future Higgs factory can probe via
general dimension-6 operators involving the observed Higgs boson (Table 1). Our analysis
utilizes the existing electroweak precision observables (EWPO), as well as the Higgs observ-
ables and precision measurements at the CEPC. The conventional scheme-dependent anal-
ysis usually ﬁxes the three electroweak parameters (g, g(cid:48), v) with three high precision elec-
troweak observables (α, GF , MZ) in the Z-scheme or (α, MW , MZ) in the W -scheme, while

In contrast, we developed a scheme-independent
approach to incorporate full experimental information (including both central values and
uncertainties) of the EWPO in section 2. With this approach, the electroweak parameters
and the new physics scales of dimension-6 operators can be ﬁtted simultaneously by the
same χ2 function.

The advantage of our scheme-independent approach is made clear when the precisions
of Z and W mass measurements become comparable at the Higgs factory (cf. Table 6). Since
new physics deviations from the SM are fairly small, as already constrained by the LHC
data, the analytical expansion up to their linear order holds well (section 3). Accordingly, we
performed the analytic linear χ2 ﬁt in Appendix B, which is physically intuitive, numerically
fast, and can be straightforwardly generalized to include any number of observables and
ﬁtting parameters for the analysis. In section 4, we demonstrated that including the existing
EWPO together with future Higgs measurements can probe the new physics scales up to
10 TeV (and to 40 TeV for the gluon-involved operator Og) at 95% C.L., as shown in Fig. 3
and Table 3. We found that including the CEPC precision measurements can further lift
the reach up to 35 TeV (Fig. 4 and Table 8). We note that this physics reach does cover the
energy range to be probed by the future hadron colliders of pp(50-100) TeV [12, 13] running
in the same circular tunnel. Hence, the precision probe at the Higgs factory can provide an
important guideline for the future new physics discoveries at the SPPC or FCC-hh. Our
study shows that the Higgs factory can probe the new physics of the Higgs sector much
more sensitively than what the LHC could achieve [34].

The Z-pole running of the e+e− collider is required by the machine calibration at its
initial stage.
In section 4.6, we further demonstrated that Z-pole measurements of the
CEPC can provide even stronger indirect probe of the new physics scales than the Higgs
observables measured at the Higgs factory (250GeV). This motivates a longer Z-pole running
to ensure the no-lose probe of new physics deviations from the SM, complementary to the
Higgs factory via the Zh production.

A Kinetic Mixing of Gauge Bosons

The dimension-6 operators can make nontrivial corrections to both the mass matrices and
the kinetic terms of gauge bosons. The situation is much simpler for charged weak bosons
W ± which have only one mass eigenstate and thus no extra mixing in the SM eﬀective
ﬁeld theory (SMEFT). On the other hand, the situation for neutral gauge bosons are more
involved since mixing between the photon A and the Z boson can arise from either loop
corrections or new physics beyond the SM. Both kinetic mixing and mass diagonalization
may appear. It is necessary to ﬁrst transform their kinetic terms into the canonical forms
and mass matrix into the diagonal form before deriving Feynman rules and computing

physical processes. Here, we provide a general formalism within the SMEFT and describe
how to deal with the corrections from dimension-6 operators up to the linear order.

A.2 Neutral Gauge Bosons

For neutral gauge bosons, both A and Z are involved. The kinetic mixing and mass terms
are hence 2× 2 matrices. Nontrivial mixing eﬀects can appear in both parts. We ﬁrst
generally parametrize the correlated propagator as,

D(q2) =

q2K − M2 ,

(A.3)

where both kinetic coeﬃcient matrix K and the mass matrix M need to be diagonalized,
SKS−1 ≡ T and RM2R−1 ≡ D2, with T and D denoting the diagonal kinetic matrix and
diagonal mass matrix, respectively. Then, we can ﬁrst diagonalize the kinetic term as,

D(q2) =

for generality, kinetic mixing can be parametrized as, K ≡ I + δK, where δK is a 2 × 2
symmetric matrix whose explicit form will be given at the end of this section. A general
feature is that its matrix elements (δK11, δK12, δK22) belong to the linear order in terms
of dimension-6 operator coeﬃcients. This leads to a sizable mixing of order O(1),

which is a summation of individual constraints. In the above, we use Oth
to denote the
the experimental measurement, and ∆Oj the associated un-
theoretical prediction, Oexp
certainty. The theoretical prediction is a function of model parameters. Here, we will just
use the κj rescaling of the Higgs coupling with the SM particles to ﬁt experimental data
(as to be elaborated in Appendix C), for an illustration. The deviation from the SM is
then parametrized as δκj ≡ κj − 1 , which are small numbers. When expanded to the
linear term of δκj, the χ2 function can be expressed as a quadratic function with matrix
manipulations,

In general, diﬀerent ﬁtting parameters are correlated with each other through the co-
eﬃcient matrix A and hence can aﬀect each other. To obtain the precision of a speciﬁc
ﬁtting parameter, we need to marginalize over the others. This can be done as a series of
iterative reductions from higher-dimensional χ2 function to lower one, each time reducing
the number of ﬁtting parameters by 1. During this process, the χ2 function can still be ex-
pressed with the quadratic form (B.5) in the ﬁtting parameter basis while the n-dimensional

error matrix Σ can be reduced to (n − 1)-dimensional (cid:101)Σ by integrating out one degree of

freedom, say the k-th branching ratio,

The hat means that the corresponding variable has been integrated out. With quadratic
χ2, this is an integration of Gaussian distribution that can be done analytically to produce
(B.6). The same procedure should be carried out until there is only one degree of freedom
left, say, the (cid:96)-th anomalous coupling. The only element of the 1-dimensional error matrix

is then its uncertainty, ∆(δκ(cid:96)) ≡(cid:113)(cid:101)Σ(cid:96)(cid:96) . To deduce the precision of all ﬁtting parameters,

we need to run over all possible values of (cid:96) and make the reduction for each case. This
analytic χ2 ﬁtting technique, along with other extensions, will be delivered in a general
purpose package BSMﬁtter [31].

C Higgs Coupling Precision Tests at CEPC

For an illustration, we apply the analytical linear χ2 ﬁtting method described in Appendix B
to extract the projected precisions of the CEPC Higgs measurements for constraining the
Higgs couplings with other SM particles. The Higgs couplings to other SM particles can
hii ≡ κi , where the possible
be deﬁned relative to their SM values by rescaling, ghii/gsm
deviation κi − 1 denotes the anomalous Higgs couplings. The CEPC Higgs observables
shown in Table 2 are then modiﬁed by the rescaling factors κi accordingly.
The cross sections of Higgsstrahlung and W W fusion processes are scaled by the Higgs
couplings with Z and W gauge bosons as δσ(Zh)/σ(Zh) (cid:39) 2δκZ and δσ(ννh)/σ(ννh) (cid:39)
2δκW . On the other hand, each partial decay width of h → ii scales as, Γhii/Γsm
hii =
i . For the exotic decay channels which are not present in the SM, such as the invisible
κ2
decays, we can parametrize its contribution as a fraction of the total SM Higgs decay
tot = Br(inv) ≡ δκinv, which is relatively small deviation in principle. Each
width, Γinv/Γsm

branching ratio Bri
is a ratio between the individual decay width and total width, and
is thus a function of all scaling factors {κi}, Since so far the SM ﬁts LHC data quite well
and the CEPC measurements can be rather precise, we expect that the relative deviations
from the SM are signiﬁcantly below one, |κi − 1| (cid:28) 1 . We thus deﬁne, κi ≡ 1 + δκi, with
|δκi| (cid:28) 1. Thus, we may expand the branching fractions up to the linear order of δκi ,

smaller eﬀect on its own, but larger on the others.

Applying our analytical χ2 ﬁtting method (Appendix B) together with the relative
uncertainties of Higgs production cross sections and branching fractions from Table 2, we
extract the sensitivities of CEPC measurements to the SM Higgs couplings as shown in
Table 9. All the anomalous Higgs couplings have precisions at 1% level, except that κγ
and κµ have larger uncertainties. This is because the branching fractions, Br(γγ) and
Br(µ¯µ), are too small according to the SM predictions [37]. As shown in Table 2, their
values are well below 1%. Since roughly 1 million Higgs particles can be produced at
CEPC [12], the decay into photon or muon can collect less than 104 events. The statistical
ﬂuctuation is thus larger than 1%. A realistic estimate gives 9% and 17%, respectively,
including both statistical and systematic uncertainties. On the contrary, the ZZh Higgs

Higgsstrahlung production cross section σ(Zh). This inclusive production rate has larger
event rate than any individual decay channel. Without σ(Zh), the precision on κZ is also
at percentage level. The same thing applies to κW , which can be constrained by the W W
fusion production rate σ(ννh), leading to roughly a factor of

2 improvement.

√

For comparison, we further present a ﬁt with Br(µ¯µ) and κµ removed in the third
column of Table 9. We note that the precision of measuring other anomalous couplings
are not aﬀected at all. This is because the branching fraction of this channel is very
small in the ﬁrst place. As explained below Eq. (C.2), the correlation is proportional to
the corresponding SM prediction Brsm
. Hence, it is rather weakly correlated with other
j
channels. We present the result of these two ﬁts in Fig. 5.

Besides the precision limits on Higgs couplings at the CEPC (250 GeV, 5 ab−1), we
also show the bounds on Higgs couplings from the LHC (14 TeV, 300 fb−1) and the HL-
LHC (14 TeV, 3 ab−1) [35], in Table 9, for comparison. It is clear that the CEPC (250 GeV,
5 ab−1) can signiﬁcantly improve the precision of Higgs coupling measurements. In addition,
many decay channels cannot be probed at the LHC. For instance, the LHC has no sensitivity
to the hc¯c coupling [35], as well as hµ¯µ coupling. But, they can be measured at the CEPC
instead. The total decay width of the SM Higgs with 125 GeV mass is about 4 MeV, which is
far below the LHC sensitivity. It is hard to make a direct measurement at the LHC without
model assumptions.
In Table 9, we also show the projected limits of the ILC (250 GeV,
250 fb−1) and ILC (500 GeV, 500 fb−1) for comparison [35]. It shows that the ILC running
at 500 GeV could have better sensitivities to the hW W and hb¯b couplings than the CEPC.
