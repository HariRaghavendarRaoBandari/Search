We investigate a simple setup in which the ATLAS & CMS diphoton excess around 750 GeV
is originated from a scalar state s decaying into two light pseudo-Goldstones a, each of which
subsequently decaying into a pair of collimated photons, misidentiﬁed as a single photon.
In a
minimal context of spontaneous symmetry breaking, we show that coupling the complex scalar ﬁeld
Φ = s + ia to a dark matter candidate, also responsible of generating its mass, allows for the correct
relic density in a large region of the parameter space, while not being excluded by direct or indirect
detection experiments. Moreover, the relic abundance condition naturally leads to a relatively large
width for the resonant ﬁeld s.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Recently ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] have reported excess
in the diphoton mass distribution around 750 GeV in
their 13 TeV data at the level of 5 − 10 fb which can be
interpreted as a (pseudo)scalar resonance with a (rela-
tively) large width. ATLAS has analyzed 3.2 fb−1 of data
and observed the local signiﬁcance of 3.9σ for an excess
peaked at 750 GeV whereas CMS, using 2.5 fb−1 of data,
has reported a local signiﬁcance of 2.6σ for an excess
peaked at 760 GeV. The global signiﬁcance is reduced
to 2.0σ and 1.2σ for ATLAS and CMS, respectively.
These announcements have initiated a large amount of
works on the subject [3], trying to ﬁt the data in eﬀec-
tive frameworks [4], featuring loop induced (typically by
new vector-like, with respect to the SM, fermions) cou-
plings of the resonance with gluons and photons which
are described by dimension 5 operators of the form:

scale at which new dynamics appears, which is typically
of the order of the mass of new fermions entering in the
loop to generate the eﬀective potential in Eq.(1). How-
ever, it was quickly realized that, in presence of only
couplings with gluons and photons, in order to obtain
a production cross-section ∼ O(10fb) and at the same
time a rather large decay width of the resonance, i.e.
Γs/ms ∼ 5 − 6%, large values of the coupling CGG of
the resonance with gluons would be needed. This possi-
bility is, however, in contrast with current observations

from dijet searches gg → s → gg at ATLAS [5], impos-
ing CGG (cid:46) 0.1. Similarly, high values of the coupling
CBB are disfavored, given the additional constraint com-
ing from additional production through photon fusion [6].

A possible solution is to increase the width of the 750
GeV resonance by adding new possible ﬁnals state. An
intriguing possibility is represented by the case in which
the additional width is provided by the decay into dark
matter pairs. Along this lines the authors of [7, 8] have
considered a coupling of the resonance with a fermionic
(Dirac or Majorana) dark matter candidate:

L1 = L0 + gχs ¯χχ + mχ ¯χχ,

(2)

However, all the studies converged to show that in this
case, direct detection (in the case of a scalar resonance)
or indirect detection (in the case of a pseudo-scalar res-
onance), strongly constraint dark matter masses up to
values of the order of 1 TeV, due to the relatively large
CGG and CBB couplings, respectively. By further com-
bining these limits with the constraints from monojet [8],
gg → χχg, the light dark matter region, mχ (cid:46) 375 GeV,
appears, in particular, excluded.

An interesting alternative has been proposed by [9–12],
consisting in the possibility that the diphoton produc-
tion process pp → s → γγ can be mimicked by a pro-
cess of the form pp → s → aa → 4γ where a is a light
pseudoscalar decaying to two collimated photons. In this
scenario a sensitive contribution to the decay width of
a scalar would come from the decay process s → aa.
This possibility has been investigated for instance in [12],
where the saa coupling is generated by the breaking of a
Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. However a large enough
coupling to achieve a width of 40 GeV of the s → aa
decay is rather unnatural since it would require a small
PQ scale of the order of 300 GeV so that the presence
of an invisible branching fraction has been nevertheless
invoked, although the new ﬁnal states have not been iden-
tiﬁed with dark matter candidates. Similarly extensive

studies has been performed in the case of the NMSSM
[13]. In this class of models the LHC signal can be re-
produced only for masses of the order of 100 MeV of a
light CP-odd Higgs since otherwise its branching ratio to
photon would be too much suppressed with respect to
the SM fermion branching fraction.

In this work, we will combine the two preceding ap-
proaches in the context of a simple model featuring spon-
taneously broken symmetry. The coupling saa is indeed
induced, after spontaneous symmetry breaking, by a clas-
sical potential term |Φ|4 = |(s + ia)|4, thus resulting pro-
portional to the quartic coupling. The complex ﬁeld Φ is
also coupled to a fermionic dark matter state χ, whose
mass is dynamically generated.

We will show that in the case the decay width of the
s is dominated by the aa channel, the diphoton excess
can be obtained for values of CGG well below the di-
jet constraint. As a by product the low values of CGG
strongly relax constraints from monojet and direct dark
matter searches while is still possible to comply with the
WMAP/PLANCK [14, 15] favored values of the dark
matter relic density.

For what regards the WMAP/PLANCK constraints,
three regions of the parameters space are open:
the
electroweak-scale dark matter (mχ (cid:39) 100 GeV), a heav-
ier window ((cid:38) 400 GeV) and a very light case (keV dark
matter). In all these windows, we checked that the di-
rect and indirect detection limits are respected, still al-
lowing a relatively large width of the scalar, exchanged
as a mediator. Our results are summarized in the ﬁnal
plot where we have shown the points respecting all the
relevant LHC constraints and giving, at the same time,
the correct relic abundance for the dark matter.

The paper is organized as follows. After a summary of
the model in the ﬁrst section, we will brieﬂy review un-
der which conditions the process pp → s → aa → 4γ
can mimic the diphoton signal. We will then derive the
parameter space allowed by ATLAS/CMS analysis, and
show that the diphoton signal can remain compatible
with a large width of s. We then introduce the dark mat-
ter candidate and compute its relic abundance, evaluat-
ing the parameter space respecting at the same time the
ATLAS/CMS excess and WMAP/PLANCK constraint.
We then conclude.

II. THE MODEL

Adding a standard model singlet fermion (Majorana or
Dirac like) with Eq.(1) is straightforward. The La-
grangian can then be written as:

If one ﬁxed the mass of the
scalar ms, all the physics is then completely determined
by a set of 5 parameters (CGG, CBB, λΦ, ma, mχ). If
one further wants to ﬁt at the same time, the width of s,
the diphoton cross section and the relic abundance, one
is left with only two free parameters. The model is then
very predictive.

III. THE LHC ANALYSIS

A. Condition to mimic a diphoton process

The decay of a substantially light pseudoscalar can pro-
duce highly collimated photons (dubbed as “photon
jets”) which can be potentially misidentiﬁed as a sin-
gle photon. The minimal condition to realize this kind
of scenario is that the opening angle ∆φ ∼ 2
γ , with the
boost factor γ, given by γ = ms
, of the two photons
emitted in the a → γγ is below the angular resolution of
2ma
the ATLAS and CMS detectors which is of the order of 20
mrad [16]. This condition provides the upper bound on
the mass of the pseudoscalar ma (cid:46) 2 GeV [9, 17, 18]. At
the same time, a very high boost typically corresponds to
an enhanced decay length of the pseudoscalar. In order
to mimic the LHC diphoton signal the decay should occur
before the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), which is
at a distance of the order of 1 m from the collision point.
A minimal requirement is then set on the decay length of

a, l = βγ/Γa (cid:28) 1 m, where βγ =(cid:112)γ2 − 1 and Γa repre-

sents the total decay width for a. This kind of constraint
is mostly relevant for values of ma, below approximately
three times the mass of the pion, such that only the decay
of a into two photons is actually accessible3. As a conse-
quence the decay length is expressed, only as function of
ma and CBB, as:

(cid:16) ms

750 GeV

l ≈ 7.3 cm

with Γs as the total width of scalar s. By requiring that
this does not exceed 1 m one obtains the following lower

2 By gauge invariance, of course, the coupling CBB induces as
well couplings with ZZ and Zγ. We have not explicitly reported
them since they have a marginal impact in our analysis.

3 It can be seen that an eventual invisible branching fraction would
be negligible, given the suppression of the dark matter coupling
at low dark matter masses.

(9)

We remark that this should be regarded as a conservative
bound. As argued in [11], for example, displaced decays
of the pseudoscalar, corresponding to l ∼ 1−10 cm, might
already be distinguishable from the prompt decay into
two isolated photons of a 750 GeV resonance.

We have reported in Fig.1 a sample plot, reporting the
allowed values of ma, according to the one of CBB, which
determines the decay rate into photons. This plot is
made for a ﬁxed value of CGG and of λΦ, correspond-
ing to a width of the scalar ﬁeld s, Γs =40 GeV. The
parameter region corresponding to the gray area, rep-
resenting l > 1 m, and substantially corresponding to
ma (cid:46) 200 MeV ,is disfavored. For reference we have also
reported the line, in the (ma, CBB) plane, corresponding
to l = 10 cm. We also show the only moderate impact of
the said limits (represented in Fig.(1) by the red region),
extensively reported e.g. in [19], from direct searches of
a light pseudoscalar in beam-dump and ﬁxed target ex-
periments.

As will be clariﬁed at the end of this section, the process
pp → s → γγ is also possible in our model since s is
coupled to two photons through the same coupling CBB
as a. We have then represented (in green) in Fig.(1) the
region where4 σ2γ ≡ σ(pp → s → γγ) > σ4γ ≡ σ(pp →
s → aa → 4γ).

mental searches of the somewhat similar h → aa → 4γ
process, with h being the SM Higgs boson, can discrimi-
nate, through suitably deﬁned calorimeter variables, iso-
lated photons from the ones coming from π0 decays.
Given the similarity between the π0 → γγ and a → γγ
processes, it is conceivable to adopt these variables to re-
duce the probability of faking single photon signals [20].

4

We ﬁnally remark that the allowed parameter space can
be constrained even further by considering the diﬀerent
conversion rate, i.e., the probability of the interaction of
a photon within the calorimeter to produce a e+e− pair,
between 2γ and 4γ events. A detailed investigation of
this possibility has been performed in Ref. [9].

B. Dijet constraints

The couplings CGG and CBB are constrained, in general,
by the requirement of the relative absence of additional
signals, e.g., dijets, Zγ or ZZ, compared to the diphoton
one. In our scenario the strongest constraint comes from
the dijet searches.
We have imposed that σ(pp → s → jj) < 11 pb, at 8
TeV center-of-mass energy [21].

In the Br(a → γγ) = 1 regime the corresponding

cross-section is given by:

FIG. 2. Range of masses allowed for ma in the (ma, CBB) plane
for diﬀerent values of the total width of s, ensuring a decay before
the calorimeter while still being suﬃciently collimated to mimic a
diphoton signal.

We have then redetermined, in Fig.2 the allowed param-
eter space in the (ma, CBB) plane, for four values of λΦ,
ranging from 0.35 to 4, and for CGG = 10−3, giving Γs
varying between 4 to 60 GeV, by using the treatment
illustrated in [12]. The upper limit on ma is lowered
to 500 − 600 MeV based on the similar considerations a
slightly weaker limit of 800 MeV has been found in [11]).
Interestingly, most of the allowed parameter space now
lies below the threshold, represented by approximately
three times the value of the pion mass, above which
hadronic decays become accessible for the pseudoscalar.
As a consequence, in this regime, Br(a → γγ) = 1 irre-
spective of the values of CBB and CGG. As will be clari-
ﬁed in the next section, this will lead to a rather predic-
tive scenario. For this reason we will refer to this region of
the parameter space for most of the analytical estimates
presented in this work. In the absence of a dedicated ex-
perimental study, we have nevertheless included, in the
numerical computations, the region m3π0 ≤ ma ≤ 2 GeV.

resonances decaying into Zγ or ZZ. On should intend Fig.1 just

process gg → s → aa → 4γ represented in Fig.3 is given
by

σgg→4γ =

Γ(s → gg)Br(s → aa)[Br(a → γγ)]2 IGG,
(11)
with IGG being the integral over the PDF (cid:39) 3400 (we
have included the next-to leading order scaling factor in
the deﬁnition of IGG). For the numerical analysis we
have used the MSTW2008NLO PDF [22]. The desired
signal could be also induced by the photon fusion [23]
process γγ → s → aa → 4γ. For simplicity we will focus
in our study on the gluon fusion process.
One can get a very simple expression for Br(s → aa) for
ma (cid:46) 500 MeV, i.e., below the three pion mass threshold.

considering the photon fusion regime. We ﬁnally notice
that the dijet limit, CGG (cid:46) 0.1 implies that the total de-
cay width of the scalar ﬁeld is mostly determined by the
s → aa process. This allows us to trade, in the analytical
expressions considered in this section, the free parameter
λΦ with the physical observable Γs.
Although it does not directly enter in the expression of
the production cross-section, the coupling CBB is not un-
constrained. Indeed the production of two single photons
from the decay of the scalar resonance s is nevertheless
possible. While deriving Eq.(14) we are implicitly re-
quiring that the rate of the latter process is enough sup-
pressed. This is achieved whether Γ(s→γγ)
Γ(s→aa) (cid:28) 1, which
implies CBB (cid:28) 0.65. We also remind again that depend-
ing on ma, CBB has a lower bound (see Fig. 1) from the
requirement of a pseudoscalar decaying before the ECAL.
A good ﬁt of the production cross-section could also be
obtained for ma (cid:38) 500 MeV with a sizable branching
fraction of a into the hadronic channels. In such a case
the cross-section is obtained by multiplying Eq.(14) by

IV. THE ANALYSIS IMPLEMENTING THE

DARK SECTOR

Once one couples the dark matter to the ﬁeld Φ through
Eq.(6), one can compute the relic abundance of χ as a
function of CGG and λΦ for diﬀerent mχ and check if
there exists parameter space compatible with the AT-
LAS/CMS observations of the diphoton excess. The re-
sult is presented in Fig.(4) where we have plotted the
parameter space allowed by the three constraints pro-
duction cross section, Γs and relic abundance- in the (λφ,
CGG) plane. We see that for any value of the dark mat-
ter mass from 200 GeV to 700 GeV, there exist values
of CGG which give a resonant production cross-section of
O(1− 10 fb) together with 4 GeV <∼ Γs <∼ 60 GeV while

still respecting PLANCK constraints. We will study the
diﬀerent regimes in detail in the following sections.

A. mχ (cid:46) 375 GeV

For ma < mχ (cid:46) ms/2 the dark matter can annihilate
into γγ, gg and aa, as well as into Zγ and ZZ, whether
kinematically open (these latter are anyway suppressed
in setup considered in this work).

Indeed, one can see the possibility to
obtain a relatively large cross section, O(1 − 10 fb), for
a large width of s (∼ 5% ms) and low values of CGG re-
specting the dijet constraints. This comes normally from
the fact that a large λΦ coupling is responsible for the
large width of s and of the large production cross sec-
tion without requiring high values of CGG, CBB. Notice
that the expressions (Eqs.(13)-(14)) do not include con-
tribution from an invisible branching fraction of s. This
happens because it is always suppressed with respect to
the s → aa decay since gχ ∝ mχ
(when ms ∼ mχ the
invisible branching fraction is, of course, phase space sup-
pressed). Similarly we have not included the decay chan-
nels related to CBB, i.e., s → γγ,→ Zγ,→ ZZ since
they are suppressed at least by a factor of 8/c2

tially excluded by the FERMI searches of monochromatic
gamma-ray signals [25], which give a limit as strong as
10−(29÷30) for dark matter masses below ∼ 100 GeV.
Even if the aa channel gives rise to a p-wave velocity
suppressed cross-section (by CP arguments),
it is the
dominant annihilation process at the decoupling time. It
proceeds mostly through the s-channel exchange of the
scalar s as depicted in the Fig.(5). It can be estimated

We show in Figs. (4) and (6) result of the complete nu-
merical analysis, performed precisely by determining the
dark matter annihilation cross sections and its relic den-
sity through the package Micromegas [26]. We notice
that the correct relic density can be achieved, through
the latter annihilation channel, at dark matter masses
of the order of 200 − 300 GeV and for Γs = 10 − 50
GeV while still ﬁtting the ATLAS/CMS diphoton data.
We also notice the typical pole eﬀect, i.e., when mχ ap-
proaches ms/2, the width needs to be narrow to avoid
the under-abundance due to thermal broadening eﬀect
[27]. On the other hand, being velocity suppressed, this
channel cannot account for any indirect detection signal
as it will be discussed in section IV D.

The γγ and gg channels mostly originate from s-channel

to achieve the correct relic abundance through the s-wave
channel due to the constraints on σgg→4γ and CBB (cid:46) 0.1
for the gg and γγ ﬁnal states, respectively. Moreover,
the gluon channel is also constrained by the dijet con-
straint, Eq.(10), and, to a lesser extent and only for
ma ≥ 500 MeV , by the FERMI searches of gamma-
rays from DSph [24]. On the other hand, the contri-

which is not velocity suppressed. The concerned cross-

In this case the dominant contribution to the dark matter

As can be seen these cross-sections are very far from
the thermally favored value, ∼ O(10−26) cm3s−1, such
that the validity itself of the WIMP paradigm becomes
questionable. We thus apply the conventional rule-of-
thumb of comparing the dark matter annihilation rate
Γann = (cid:104)σv(cid:105)nχ,eq with the Hubble expansion rate, both
evaluated at temperatures of the order of the dark mat-
ter mass. Considering for reference the γγ annihilation

For values of the model parameters compatible with
the LHC signal we have that for dark matter masses be-
low 100 MeV, annihilations become ineﬃcient while the
dark matter is still relativistic and that the ratio Γann

drops very steeply as long as the dark matter mass is
further reduced. The dark matter could be neverthe-
less kept into thermal equilibrium by the decay process

As evident, in the case of Γs/ms ∼ 5% the cross-section
exceeds the thermally favored value and leads, conse-
quently, to an overabundant dark matter. This is also
reﬂected from Fig.(6) the correct relic density is achieved,
for mχ > 375 GeV, only for decay widths below 15 GeV.

cesses occur below the temperature of the QCD phase transition,
of the order of 200 MeV, and then the hadronic annihilation
channel is not accessible.

We thus notice that the a ↔ χχ process is rather eﬃ-
cient and keep the dark matter in equilibrium unless the
dark matter mass is of the order of 1 keV (or even below)
for Γs/ms > 2%. Remembering that dark matter masses
below the keV are excluded by structure formation, we
conclude that light dark matter is coupled to the primor-
dial thermal bath until T ∼ ma when it occurs relativistic

where g∗,S(Td) represents the number of relativistic de-
grees of freedom at the temperature Td of decoupling of
the dark matter while geﬀ is the number of internal de-
grees of freedom of the dark matter itself. The correct
relic density could be achieved for mχ ∼ 100eV, incon-
sistently with the conditions stated above. For viable
values of the mass, i.e. (cid:38) O(keV), the dark matter is
overabundant. For Γs/ms < 2%, on the contrary, there
is a small window of masses, mχ ∼ 1 − 10 keV for which
the dark matter cannot get into thermal equilibrium in
the Early Universe. In this case the dark matter is pro-
duced through freeze-in by the decay of the pseudoscalar.
Its relic density is given by:

If the dark matter is not in thermal equilibrium, the
decay s → χχ gives also rise to freeze-in production
[28], however its contribution is suppressed with re-
spect Eq.(24) (it is indeed given by Eq.(24) replacing
ma → ms). As can be seen, the correct dark matter relic
density requires a very small width of the scalar ﬁeld, i.e.
(cid:46) 1%, or masses of the pseudoscalar of the order of 2
GeV.

The analytical expressions reported above have been val-
idated by solving a system of coupled Boltzmann equa-
tions tracking the abundance of the dark matter itself

FIG. 8. Evolution of the abundance of the s, a and χ ﬁelds, as
determined by the numerical solution of a system of Boltzmann
equations in the very light dark matter regime. The two panels
refer to the two values of the dark matter mass of 2 and 50 keV.
As evident from the comparison with the dark matter equilibrium
distribution (dotted orange line), for the lightest mass the dark
matter is not capable of getting into thermal equilibrium and it
is produced through freeze-in. In the 50 keV case the dark mat-
ter instead goes into thermal equilibrium and decouples while still
relativistic.

as well as the ones of the scalar ﬁeld s and of the pseu-
doscalar ﬁeld a.

Two examples of the numerical solution of this system are
shown in ﬁgure ref (8). Here two values of the dark mat-
ter have been considered, respectively 2 keV (left panel)
and 50 keV (right panel). In the light dark matter case,
we notice that the dark matter abundance is always well
below the equilibrium one (dotted orange6 curve). It is
produced at temperatures of the order of the mass of
the pseudoscalar ma, as expected for the freeze-in mech-
anism, and the numerical value of its abundance, as de-

of the order of 100 MeV, hence corresponding to x ∼ O(10).

termined by the solution of the system of equations, is
in very good agreement with the theoretical prediction
stated in Eq.(24). We also notice that, for the chosen
assignation of the parameters, the dark matter abun-
dance matches the experimental expectation. On the
contrary, for the heavier value of the mass, the dark mat-
ter abundance perfectly tracks the thermal equilibrium
function until, again, temperatures of the order of the
mass ma of the pseudoscalar and then remains constant
conﬁrming the prediction of a relativistic decoupling. In-
teresting signatures of such scenario would be the inter-
pretation of the 3.5 keV monochromatic signal recently
observed in diﬀerent clusters of galaxies [29].

D. Dark Matter Detection

One of the main characteristic of the proposed scenario,
with respect to the direct diphoton production from a
750 GeV resonance, is the fact that the expected produc-
tion cross-section is obtained for sensitively lower values
of the CGG and CBB couplings. As already mentioned
in the introduction, this potentially implies weaker limits
from dark matter searches. For what regards dark matter
direct detection the most relevant interactions are, sim-
ilarly to Refs. [7, 8], Spin Independent (SI) interactions,
originated by the exchange of the scalar ﬁeld s. The SI
cross-section can be written, in our scenario, as:

correct relic density for the same two values of Γs while the blue
and green dashed lines represent the minimal value of CBB, in the
low ma regime, which guarantee a decay of the pseudoscalar before
the calorimeter.

and results well be low the current limits by LUX [30],
given the very small value of CGG. By a similar argument
on gets that also the monojet production cross-section
is extremely suppressed so that also the corresponding
bound is not eﬀective.

On the contrary, a potential impact, is still retained by
Indirect dark matter searches. At the moment, the most
eﬀective constraint is the one coming from FERMI and
HESS searches of gamma-ray lines which can probe even
rather low values of CBB. Although this might not di-
rectly aﬀect the LHC production cross-section one has to
check that, in the low ma regime, values of CBB compat-
ible with the decay within the detector are allowed.

This check is shown in Fig.(9) where we have re-
ported the excluded regions by FERMI/HESS, in the
plane (mχ, CBB) for the minimal and maximal values,
of respectively 4 and 60 GeV, of Γs considered in this
work. This limits are compared with the minimal values
of CBB, as allowed by the analysis shown in Fig.(2), cor-
responding to the two values of Γs. For reference we have
also reported the isocontours of the correct relic density.

case the s-wave annihilation χχ → sa gives a character-
istic signal represented by a wide gamma-ray box [31]7
which can be probed by in the next future by CTA [32].

while still allowed by accelerator constraints, (8 TeV
searches of dijets, Zγ, ZZ, decay length of the pseu-
doscalar a below 1 meter) and dark matter detection
limits discussed in the previous section. We can clearly
distinguish three regions in the ﬁgure: in the low mass re-
gion (mχ (cid:46) 300 GeV), the relic abundance is dominated
by the p-wave (velocity suppressed) annihilation channel
χχ → s → aa (Fig.5). In this case a large width (above
∼ 20 GeV) is necessary to compensate the velocity sup-
pression eﬀect and avoid overabundance of dark matter
In a second region 300 (cid:46) mχ (cid:46) 400,
in the Universe.
the correct abundance is obtained through the pole re-
gion of the same diagram. In this case, narrow width of s
(below 10 GeV) is necessary to avoid underabundance of
dark matter. Finally, in the last region (mχ (cid:38) 400 GeV),
the t-channel (s-wave) annihilation depicted in Fig.(7)
determine the relic abundance of χ. As the ﬁnal state sa
has an odd parity, there is no velocity suppression and a
moderate width (of the order of 10 GeV) is then needed
to respect the WMAP/PLANCK constraint.

It is also interesting to notice on Fig.(11) that if the fu-
ture ATLAS/CMS analysis determine more precisely the
value of the width Γs, it will become possible to deduce
the dark matter mass respecting the cosmological con-
straint. If the large width scenario is conﬁrmed, an elec-
troweak mass (∼ 200 GeV) will be favored.
Before moving to the conclusion we just brieﬂy comment
on some theoretical aspects relative to our scenario. Our
work has substantially phenomenological purposes and
we have then not referred to any particular setup for the
origin of the couplings CGG and CBB. As pointed for
example in [12, 33], the extra matter needed to gener-
ate, at the loop level, the CGG, CBB couplings aﬀects the
running of the gauge couplings, driving them towards the
non-perturbative regime already at energy scales of few
TeV, thus disfavoring too much high values of these cou-
plings. Similarly to [12], we then remark that the low

FIG. 11. Summary plot representing the points respecting at the
same time the LHC and cosmological constraints in the plane (mχ,
Γs)

values, with respect to the case of a resonance decay-
ing into isolated photons, of CGG, CBB needed to ﬁt the
LHC excess, relax also theoretical constraints, besides
the experimental ones. In scenarios like the one consid-
ered in this work, a strong impact is still retained by the
RGE running of the quartic coupling λΦ. In view of this
the higher values of λΦ considered here, corresponding
to Γs ∼ 40 − 60 GeV, might result in tension with con-
straints from theoretical consistency. On the other hand
we remark that, except for values of mχ of the order of
200 GeV, phenomenological constraints favor values of
Γs below 15 GeV, which correspond to values λΦ ∼ 1
which allow to maintain a safe theoretical framework at
least at energy scales relevant for the phenomenological
analysis.

V. CONCLUSION

We have considered in this note the possibility that the
diphoton signal is in reality produced through the de-
cay of two light pseudo-scalars into two pairs of highly
collimated photons, indistinguishable from isolated pho-
tons. We have shown that, in a spontaneous symmetry
breaking framework, once one couple the scalar sector
to the dark matter, can re-open a large range of dark
matter masses compatible with all present experimental
constraints.

is narrow and is sensitive to searches of gamma-ray lines. We
have included the corresponding constraint in the parameter scan
