Cd(Se,Te) Quantum Dots (QD) in ZnSe barrier typically exhibit a very high spectral density,
which precludes investigation of single dot photoluminescence. We design, grow and study individual
Cd(Se,Te)/ZnSe QDs of low spectral density of emission lines achieved by implementation of a Mn-
assisted epitaxial growth. We ﬁnd an unusually large variation of exciton-biexciton energy diﬀerence
(3 meV ≤ ∆EX−XX ≤ 26 meV) and of exciton radiative recombination rate in the statistics of
QDs. We observe a strong correlation between the exciton-biexciton energy diﬀerence, exciton
recombination rate, splitting between dark and bright exciton, and additionally the exciton ﬁne
structure splitting δ1 and Landé factor. Above results indicate that values of the δ1 and of the
Landé factor in the studied QDs are dictated primarily by the electron and hole respective spatial
shift and wavefunctions overlap, which vary from dot to dot due to a diﬀerent degree of localization
of electrons and holes in, respectively, CdSe and CdTe rich QD regions.

INTRODUCTION

Three dimensional quantum conﬁnement of electrons
(e) and holes (h), such as in a semiconductor Quantum
Dot (QD) potential, results in a variety of eﬀects result-
ing from a discrete energy levels structure and an in-
creased overlap between the e and h. Typically, a QD
and a surrounding barrier are made of materials shar-
ing a common cation, to recall example of InAs/GaAs,
CdTe/ZnTe or CdSe/ZnSe QDs. The QDs for which the
QD and the barrier materials have no common atom are
by far less investigated, despite of several advantages they
oﬀer. In the case of such QDs with type-I conﬁnement
one should mention here larger band oﬀsets providing
higher conﬁning potentials for both, e and h. Such mixed
structures may lead also to type-II conﬁnement, with a
decreased wavefunction overlap of the conﬁned e and
h. Such increased e-h spatial separation and resulting
enhancement of conﬁned carriers lifetimes is highly at-
tractive for studies of magnetic polaron in semimagnetic
QDs1,2 or Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect,3 as well as for imple-
mentation of QDs in photovoltaic devices4–6. The inter-
mediate case between type-I and type-II conﬁnement, as
in the present study, oﬀers a chance of investigation of the
impact of e and h wavefunctions overlap on properties of
excitonic QDs emission.

In the present work, we design, produce and study in-
dividual Cd(Se,Te) QDs embedded in ZnSe barrier. Any
composition gradient within the Cd(Se,Te) QD volume
results in a decreased spatial overlap of wavefunctions of
the e and h, due to localization of the e and h in regions,
which are richer, respectively, in CdTe and CdSe (see Fig-
ure 1 providing a scheme of respective band alignments).
We implement a Mn-assisted epitaxial growth, which
allows us to obtain a very low spectral density of the
QDs, which enables us to study emission of single QDs.
We ﬁnd a wide distribution of exciton (X) and biexciton

(XX) emission energy diﬀerence (3 meV ≤ ∆EX−XX ≤
26 meV). A large scatter is found also for the X lifetime
(280 - 620 ps). A statistics collected on several QDs in-
dicates that the ∆EX−XX is strongly correlated with the
X lifetime and a bright-dark exciton splitting δ0, both
quantities being a direct measure of e-h wavefunctions
overlap.7–9 In addition, we establish that the ∆EX−XX is
strongly correlated with such QD emission properties as
the magnitude of the X ﬁne structure exchange splitting
δ1 and Landé-factor. This indicates a way for a straight-
forward identiﬁcation of QDs with properties desired for
a given implementation10,11 without a need of in-depth
studies, like emission dynamics or magnetophotolumines-
cence. The reported distinct dependence of the X ﬁne
structure splittings and Landé factor on a degree of e-h
wavefunction overlap has been rarely observed in II-VI
QD systems so far, despite that it was well established in
the case of III-V low dimensional heterostructures12–15.
Here, we beneﬁt from the fact that, in contrary to the
case of typical binary II-VI QD systems, the e-h separa-
tion changes signiﬁcantly from QD to QD, enabling us to
perform a systematic study.

II. EXPERIMENT

For micro-Photoluminescence (µ-PL) studies the sam-
ple is placed in a pumped helium cryostat (temperature
down to T = 1.5 K) equipped with a superconducting
split coil magnet. A magnetic ﬁeld of up to B = 10 T is
applied either in Faraday (~k k ~B) or Voigt (~k ⊥ ~B) con-
ﬁguration. The magnetic ﬁeld is perpendicular or parallel
to the sample surface in this two respective cases. The
QDs emission is excited above the barrier bandgap ei-
ther in a continuous-wave mode at Eexc = 3.06 eV (λexc
= 405 nm) or in a pulsed mode (100 fs pulse duration,
75 MHz repetition rate) at 3.26 eV (λexc = 380 nm). The

2

assembled mode out of atomic layers of Se, Cd, Te, Cd,
and Se (each one for time of 15 sec) consecutively de-
posited at temperature of the substrate set to 335 ◦C.
An approximately monolayer thick CdSe layer (aC dSe =
0.608 nm) inserted between CdTe layer and ZnSe dimin-
ishes the strain resulting from the CdTe and the ZnSe
lattice mismatch.29,30 A small ﬂux of the Mn ions assists
deposition of the Te layer. The QD layer is covered with
a 80 nm thick ZnSe cap. A reference sample, for which
no Mn ions are introduced is also grown under the same
conditions.

The presence of Mn induces a signiﬁcant decrease of
spectral density of QD emission lines (see Fig. 2). A spa-
tial density of emitting QDs estimated from µ-PL spectra
drops from 2000/µm2 in the case of the reference sam-
ple down to 100/µm2 in the case of the sample produced
by the Mn-assited growth. The reduction of QD density
for over an order of magnitude results most likely from a
reduced mobility of adatoms on the sample surface dur-
ing the QD nucleation when the Mn atoms are present.35
The energy of QDs emission lowered with respect to the
reference sample case (Fig. 2) suggests that the presence
of Mn induces also an increased QD size. A qualitatively
similar, strong eﬀect of Mn incorporation on the surface
morphology and plastic relaxation has been recently re-
ported on also for (Al,Ga)N/GaN heterostructures.36

The HAADF micrographs conﬁrm the presence of a
QD layer in the studied structures (see Fig. 3a)). Chem-
ical analysis involving the EDX spectroscopy reveals an
expected decrease of the signal related to Zn (Fig. 3b)
and an increase of the signal related to Cd (Fig. 3c)) in
the QD layer. Not complete vanishing of the signal re-
lated to the Zn in the QD layer (Fig. 3b)) is understood
when taking into account that the specimen thickness
(100 nm) is larger than an individual QD diameter. In
such a case signals from both, the Cd(Se,Te) QDs and
the ZnSe barrier, contribute to the EDX spectra in the
QD layer spatial region.

In the time-integrated
measurement the signal is detected using a CCD camera
coupled to a 0.75 m spectrometer (50 µeV of overall spec-
tral resolution). Linear and circular polarizations of the
signal are resolved. In the time-resolved µ-PL measure-
ments, the signal is detected by a Hamamatsu Photonics
C5680 streak camera with 5 ps temporal resolution.

The

transmission electron microscope
(STEM) micrographs of the samples are obtained in
high-angle annular dark ﬁeld detector using FEI Tecnai
Osiris instrument. The analysis is carried out at an
acceleration voltage of 200 keV and point resolution
of ∼1.36 Å. In order to determine the concentration
of Zn, Se, Te and Cd in the structure cross-section,
a local chemical analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) is performed on the 100 nm thick
specimen. The TEM specimen is prepared using the
classical method of mechanical polishing followed by ion
milling down to electron transparency.

III. CD(SE,TE)/ZNSE QUANTUM DOTS

PRODUCED BY A MN-ASSISTED EPITAXIAL

GROWTH

So far, mixed, Se and Te based, QDs were achieved pri-
marily by a colloidal synthesis19–25. However, integration
of such colloidal QDs into operational devices might be
challenging. It should be easier in the case of epitaxially
grown structures, which oﬀer also a feasibility of p- and
n- type doping. On the other hand, strain resulting from
a very large lattice mismatch26–30 between CdTe (aCdTe
= 0.648 nm) and ZnSe (aZnSe = 0.567 nm) (above 14%)
leads to a high spatial density of QDs combining these
two compounds. This has precluded spectroscopy of in-
dividual QDs in such mixed type systems so far.2,3,29–34
Cd(Se,Te)/ZnSe QDs presented in this letter are grown
by molecular beam epitaxy on a 1 µm thick ZnSe buﬀer
deposited on a GaAs substrate. They form in a self-

Figure 3d) shows the vertically integrated EDX signal

presence of the Se and Te atoms in the QDs layer. The
average tellurium content in the QDs is determined to
xTe = 0.22 ± 0.03 using a procedure described in the
Appendix. Note that the Mn concentration is too low to
be detected by the chemical analysis.

IV. RESULTS

A.

Impact of e-h wavefunctions overlap on

conﬁned exciton dynamics and isotropic part of e-h

exchange interaction

A temporal evolution of the emission spectrum of a se-
lected Cd(Se,Te)/ZnSe QD following the excitation pulse
is presented in an image acquired by the streak camera
(Fig. 4a)). Excitonic transitions shown are identiﬁed as
the recombination of the X and XX conﬁned in the same
QD.37 A doublet of lines evidenced in the case of both,
the X and XX, reﬂects a ﬁne structure exchange split-
ting δ1 characteristic for a neutral exciton conﬁned in an
anisotropic QD.9,38

Emission lifetime at the energy of the X and XX
transitions is determined by ﬁtting of a monoexponen-
tial decay curve to the emission intensity at respective
cross-sections of the streak camera image (see Fig. 4a)).
The X lifetime determined for the selected QD equals
to 450 ps.
In the QD statistics, the X lifetime ranges
from 620 ps, which is rather long for II-VI epitaxial
QDs, down to 280 ps,
in consistency with the previ-
ous reports on CdSe/ZnSe QDs.39 The resulting decay
rates ΓX determined as an inverse of the lifetime are
plotted against the X-XX energy diﬀerence ∆EX−XX in
Fig. 4b).
It is seen that the ΓX signiﬁcantly increases
with the increasing ∆EX−XX. We note that the biexci-
ton decay time of 120 ps corresponds to the decay rate
(ΓXX) around 9 ns−1, that is up to 6 times faster than

the ΓX, much more than observed previously for the pure
CdSe/ZnSe QDs.39,40 The ΓXX only slightly increases
with the ∆EX−XX (not shown).

In order to asses factors governing the X lifetime, we
determine the bright-dark exciton splitting δ0 resulting
from isotropic component of the e-h exchange interac-
tion. The δ0 has been shown to be a direct measure of the
e-h wavefunctions overlap.8,9,41 To determine the δ0 we
brighten the dark exciton state Xd by application of the
magnetic ﬁeld in a direction parallel to the sample plane
(see the inset to Fig. 4c)).42 We trace the energy position
of the Xd as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld and we de-
termine its energy in the limit of zero magnetic ﬁeld by
extrapolation. Values of the δ0 of the order of 1 meV are
found, as expected for II-VI QDs.38,39,43 We ﬁnd that the
δ0 increases with the increasing ∆EX−XX (see Fig. 4c)).
Comparison of Figs. 4b) and c) reveals a high degree of
correlation between the exciton radiative decay rate and
the δ0. This conﬁrms that: (i) dominating contribution
to the δ0 comes from a short-range component of the e-
h exchange interaction within the exciton, in agreement
with previous theoretical considerations,8,9,41,42 (ii) the
X decay in the studied QDs is governed by a radiative
recombination, while non-radiative processes are negligi-
ble.

A large range of variation of the ∆EX−XX, ΓX and δ0
suggests that the e-h spatial separation changes strongly
from dot to dot. The increase of the exciton radiative
decay rate and of the δ0 with the increasing ∆EX−XX al-
lows us to treat the ∆EX−XX as an estimate of the degree
of e-h wavefunctions overlap in the further discussion.
Time integrated measurements presented in Sec. IV B
shed more light on optical properties of the studied QDs.

coming from the sample produced by the Mn-assited
growth. The emission lines are identiﬁed as the X
and XX recombination.37 The energy diﬀerence ∆EX−XX
amounts to 2.99 meV and 20.38 meV in the case of the
QD1 and the QD2, respectively. As discussed in the pre-
vious Section, the ∆EX−XX acts as a measure of the e-
h wavefunction overlap. Thus, the QD1 and QD2 rep-
resent two extreme cases of a "small" and "large" e-h
overlap, respectively. Note that the QD1 exhibits much
lower intensity as compared to the QD2, as expected for a
QD with a decreased exciton oscillator strength resulting
from a decreased e-h overlap.42,44

The spectra of the XX and X transitions from the QD1
and the QD2 plotted as a function of a detected linear
polarization angle reveal two linearly polarized orthogo-
nal components (see panels c-f) in the Fig. 5). An exact
antiphase of two components of the X doublet with re-
spect to the XX doublet conﬁrms that the transitions
indeed originate from the same QD.37 The ﬁne structure
splitting δ1 for the X and XX from the QD1 amounts to
0.61 meV. In the case of the QD2, much smaller δ1 equal
to 0.07 meV is found.

1 + (gµBB)2, where E0 represent transition energy
at B = 0 T, δ1 is the X ﬁne-structure splitting, while
g and µB represent parallel excitonic Landé factor and
Bohr magneton, respectively. The g-factor determined
from the ﬁt equals to 1.61 for the QD2, which is quite typ-
ical value for CdSe/ZnSe QDs. In contrast, the g = 0.95

found for the QD1 is atypically small as for the QD based
on any selenium or tellurium compound. The parameters
describing the X emission determined in this Subsection
for the QD1 and QD2 suggest that in the studied QDs
the δ1 decreases, while the g increases with the increasing
∆EX−XX. The results obtained on a statistics of around
twenty QDs are discussed in the next Subsection.

C. Discussion

The values of the excitonic Landé factor and the δ1 de-
termined for a number of Cd(Se,Te)/ZnSe QDs are plot-
ted against the ∆EX−XX in Fig. 6a). The values for typ-
ical, binary type CdTe/ZnTe and CdSe/ZnSe QDs are
also presented for a reference (after Ref. 45).

A striking property of the studied QDs is that the
∆EX−XX covers a very wide energy range from 3 meV
to 25 meV (see Fig. 4 and Fig. 6). In the case of CdSe
or CdTe based QDs the ∆EX−XX exhibits typically a low
scatter and remains in a relatively narrow range of 20-
25 meV38–40,43,45–48 or 12-15 meV44–46,49,50, respectively.
Hence, the ∆EX−XX in our case spans from values typ-
ical for the CdSe/ZnSe QDs, through values typical for
the CdTe/ZnTe QDs, down to much lower values, which
were not observed before for the CdSe or the CdTe based
QDs systems and which would not be expected for the
Cd(Se,Te)/ZnSe QDs if they were homogeneous in a vol-
ume. The strongly reduced values of the ∆EX−XX mean
that the e and h wavefunctions are separated in space
much more than in pure CdSe or CdTe based QDs. It
results most likely from a localization of the electrons
in CdSe and the holes in CdTe rich regions (see Fig. 1)
present in the QD volume. We link the presence of such

respectively.

regions to the QD layer growth procedure (Sec. III),
namely the formation of the QDs out of the deposited
consecutively CdSe and CdTe layers. A possible strain
would widen the CdTe bandgap and narrow the ZnSe
bandgap, even further enhancing the carrier localization
eﬀects.21

Moreover, the Fig. 6 reveals a clear increase of the ex-
citonic Landé factor and a decrease of the δ1 with the
increasing ∆EX−XX. Such dependencies have not been
reported for epitaxial II-VI QDs so far. As it is seen in
Fig. 6a), the g-factor attains the value as small as 0.95 for
the QD characterized by the ∆EX−XX = 2.99 meV. At the
ﬁrst sight it is surprising, since typical g-factors of CdSe
and CdTe QDs are both equal or larger than 1.6, what
would result in the g-factor value exceeding 1.6 for a QD
made of fully mixed (Cd,Se)Te. This is apparently not
the case, which gives a hint that the decreased ∆EX−XX
indeed reﬂects the increased e-h separation resulting from
a presence of CdTe and CdSe rich regions in the studied
QDs. For the Cd(Se,Te)/ZnSe QDs with large values of
the ∆EX−XX, the excitonic g-factor is approximately the
same as for the pure CdSe/ZnSe QDs (see Fig. 6a)), that
is around 1.6.38,43 The increase of the parallel Landé fac-
tor with the decreasing size of the conﬁning potential in
the growth direction, was previously observed in the case

of QWs51,52 and arsenide based QDs13,14,53,54, as well as
colloidal PbS nanocrystals.55 The eﬀect was attributed
to a quenching of the orbital momentum of a heavy hole
when the hole wavefunction undergoes squeezing in the
direction parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld.54

The δ1 varies with the increasing ∆EX−XX from around
1 meV, the value larger than for reference CdSe/ZnSe or
CdTe/ZnTe QDs, down to the values below 0.06 meV (see
Fig. 6b)). It has been shown previously that a dominant
contribution to the δ1 comes from the long-range compo-
nent of the e-h exchange interaction.7–9,41 The magnitude
of the δ1, similarly as the magnitude of the short-range
component, have been shown to increase with a decreas-
ing QD size (thus with the increasing e-h overlap).7–9,41
Thus, in the presently studied QDs, one should expect
enhancement of the δ1 with the ∆EX−XX. This is, how-
ever, not the case, what indicates that in the studied
QDs, not just the overall e and h wavefunctions over-
lap, but speciﬁcally the anisotropy of the exciton wave-
function in the QD plane provides a main contribution
to the δ1. A decrease of δ1 with a decreasing QD size
was previously observed in the case of epitaxially grown
InAs/GaAs QDs12,56 and attributed to the dominating
inﬂuence of piezoelectricity or heavy hole-light hole sub-
bands mixing eﬀects.
In our case, the increase of the

biexciton energy diﬀerence ∆EX−XX. Respective values for
CdSe/ZnSe and CdTe/ZnTe QDs are also shown for a refer-
ence (after Ref. 45).

δ1 is correlated rather with the increasing Te content in
the Cd(Se,Te)/ZnSe QDs, which translates into a larger
respective spatial shift of the e and h in the QD plane.
We note that for the Cd(Se,Te)/ZnSe QDs with large
values of the ∆EX−XX not only the g-factor, but also the
ﬁne structure splitting δ1 (0.1 - 0.3 meV) matches the
one of the pure CdSe/ZnSe QDs38,43 (see Fig. 6b)). This
points toward binary type QD composition in the case
of these QDs. This results most likely from an eﬃcient
substitution of Te atoms by Se atoms during the QD
growth, due to a much higher sticking coeﬃcient of the
Se atoms as compared to the Te atoms.57,58

No systematic dependence of a diamagnetic coeﬃcient
γ on the ∆EX−XX is found (not shown). The γ is typ-
ically related to a span of the e and h wavefunctions in
the QD plane. Thus, we state the e-h wavefunctions over-
lap varies from dot to dot mainly in the sample growth
direction.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated systematically the impact of the
electron-hole separation on optical properties of individ-
ual Cd(Se,Te)/ZnSe quantum dots. The reduced spec-
tral density of QD emission lines obtained thanks to the
Mn-assisted epitaxial growth has provided us an access
to individual QDs emission. A statistics involving several
individual QDs is collected. We have found that there ex-
ists a high degree of correlation between quantities being
a direct measure of the e-h wavefunctions overlap, such
as the exciton radiative decay rate and the bright-dark
exciton splitting δ0, with the exciton-biexciton energy
diﬀerence ∆EX−XX. The ∆EX−XX varies signiﬁcantly

6

from dot to dot, i.e., it changes from values typical for
CdSe/ZnSe QDs and CdTe/ZnTe QDs, down to values
as small as 3 meV, which were not reported previously
for either of the two binary type systems. We attribute
the wide distribution of the ∆EX−XX to a wide range of
variation of the studied QDs composition and inhomo-
geneity aﬀecting the e-h wavefunctions overlap. In par-
ticular, the strongly reduced ∆EX−XX points toward a
presence of the CdTe and CdSe rich regions in the stud-
ied QDs, which localize electron and hole, respectively,
and account for an increased e-h separation.

Moreover, in contrary to a simple expectation, the
Cd(Se,Te)/ZnSe QDs g-factor is smaller than g-factors
found previously in case of both, CdSe/ZnSe QDs and
CdTe/ZnTe, binary type QD systems. Additionally, a
distinct and so far not observed for II-VI QDs, depen-
dencies of the g-factor and of the ﬁne structure exchange
splitting δ1 on the ∆EX−XX are found. The g-factor
increases, while the δ1 decreases with the increasing
∆EX−XX, that is with the increasing e-h wavefunctions
overlap.

Since an ability of selection of QDs with precisely de-
ﬁned emission properties is a prerequisite for QDs practi-
cal implementations, the demonstrated parametrization
of the g-factor or the δ1 by the ∆EX−XX in the studied
QDs provides a perspective for overcoming of the limits
related to a scatter of the g-factor and the δ1 values ob-
served typically in the QDs ensemble. At the same time,
further eﬀorts for obtaining QDs with a degree of sepa-
ration of conﬁned carriers controlled on the production
stage are still desired.

Appendix

Determination of the average molar density x of the Te
atoms in the Cd(Se,Te) QDs bases on relative changes of

7

of Zn and Se signal in the QDs layer. As evidenced in
Fig. 3d), showing the vertically integrated EDX signal for
of Zn, Se, Cd, Te, and Mn as a function of the distance
from the QDs plane, this is, however, not the case. The
diﬀerent relative decrease of the Zn and Se signal in the
QDs layer conﬁrms the presence of the Se atoms in the
QDs. Since a number of the Cd anions in the Cd(Se,Te)
QDs is equal to the sum of the, substituting each other,
Te and Se cations, the ratio of a relative decrease ∆ISe
of the Se signal to a relative decrease ∆IZn of the Zn
signal (substituted by Cd) gives the ratio of the Te to Cd
atom densities, thus the average molar density x of the
Te atoms in the Cd(Se,Te) QDs:

x =

∆ISe
∆IZn

We note that the EDX signal detection sensitivity de-
pends in unknown way on a given element. As a result,
the absolute values of EDX signal for each element are
also not known. It is known, however, that the signals
for Se and Zn in the ZnSe barrier region attain their
maximum values. These values serve as a reference in
determination of relative changes of the EDX signal in
the QD layer for respective elements.

FIG. 7: Determination of average Te content in the Cd(Se,Te)
QDs: the ratio of the Te to Cd atom densities, that is the
average molar density x of the Te in the Cd(Se,Te) QDs is set
by the ratio of a relative decrease ∆ISe of the EDX signal of
Se to a relative decrease ∆IZn of the EDX signal of Zn (which
is substituted by Cd).

a vertically integrated EDX signal. Formation of pure
CdTe QDs would result in equal relative (with respect to
the maximum determined for the barrier layer) decrease
