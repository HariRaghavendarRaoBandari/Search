Abstract

Entangling two remote quantum systems which never interact directly is an essential primitive in

quantum information science. In quantum optics, remote entanglement experiments[1–3] provides

one approach[4] for loophole-free tests of quantum non-locality[5, 6] and form the basis for the

modular architecture of quantum computing[7]. In these experiments, the two qubits, Alice and

Bob, are each ﬁrst entangled with a traveling photon. Subsequently, the two photons paths inter-

fere on a beam-splitter before being directed to single-photon detectors. Such concurrent remote

entanglement protocols using discrete Fock states can be made robust to photon losses[8], unlike

schemes that rely on continuous variable states[9, 10]. This robustness arises from heralding the

entanglement on the detection of events which can be selected for their unambiguity. However, ef-

ﬁciently detecting single photons is challenging in the domain of superconducting quantum circuits

because of the low energy of microwave quanta. Here, we report the realization of a novel mi-

crowave photon detector implemented in the circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) framework

of superconducting quantum information, and the demonstration, with this detector, of a robust

form of concurrent remote entanglement. Our experiment opens the way for the implementation

of the modular architecture of quantum computation with superconducting qubits.

The concept of a photon, the quantum of excitation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, was

introduced by Planck and Einstein to explain black-body radiation spectrum[11] and the

photoelectric eﬀect[12]. However, experiments that would deﬁnitively prove the existence of

optical photons were only understood[13, 14] and realized[15] much later in the 20th century.

Although there is no reason to doubt that microwave photons would behave diﬀerently

than their optical counterparts, revealing and manipulating them is much more challenging

because their energies are 4 to 5 orders of magnitude lower. Cavity-QED, and later on

circuit-QED, have established the reality of stationary quantum microwave excitations of a

superconducting resonator by strongly coupling them to Rydberg[16] and superconducting

artiﬁcial atoms[17]. The production of traveling microwave photons was then indirectly

demonstrated using linear ampliﬁers to measure the state of the radiation[18–20]. However,

while there have been proposals and implementations of single ﬂying microwave photon

detectors[21–23], controlling and employing the single-photon nature of microwave radiation

is still an open challenge. Here, we present such a detector using a superconducting 3D

transmon qubit[24], a promising candidate system for a scalable quantum computer. We

operate this artiﬁcial atom in a regime that directly exploits the properties of single photons

and carry over to the microwave domain the remote entanglement experiments performed

in quantum optics.

In the absence of single microwave photon detectors, the only form of remote entangle-

ment realized so far with superconducting qubits has been through the use of continuous

variable coherent states as the ﬂying information carriers[25]. While such states can be eﬃ-

ciently processed by quantum-limited linear parametric ampliﬁers[26, 27] readily available at

microwave frequencies, a disadvantage of this protocol is its sensitivity to losses in the paths

of the ﬂying states. In contrast, remote entanglement using ﬂying single photons is robust

to these losses because there are protocols where the detection of photons is uniquely linked

to the production of a pure entangled state[8, 28]. This feature is particularly important

for generating entanglement between two distant stationary qubits, a crucial element of the

modular architecture of quantum computation[7] and the proposed quantum internet[29].

Furthermore, in order to scale up the modular architecture to many modules, a concur-

rent protocol with a strong on/oﬀ ratio is required, a problem not addressed by previously

demonstrated sequential methods[25]. Thus, in the implementation of the modular archi-

tecture with superconducting qubits, demonstrating a robust form of concurrent remote

2

entanglement is a vital step.

The experiment, housed in a dilution refrigerator below 20 mK, consists of two super-

conducting transmon qubits (see Fig. 1A), referred to as Alice and Bob, in separate 3D
cavities[24]. The cavities have nearly identical resonance frequencies ωg
ωg

A/2π = 7.6314 GHz,
B/2π = 7.6316 GHz and bandwidths κA/2π = 1.2 MHz, κB/2π = 0.9 MHz. Their strongly
coupled output ports are connected by microwave coaxial cables to the two input ports of a
180◦ hybrid, the microwave equivalent of a 50/50 beamsplitter. One of the output ports of
the hybrid is connected to a microwave single photon detector which is realized by a third,
purposely detuned (ωg

D/2π = 7.6222 GHz), 3D cavity also containing a transmon. The other
output port of the hybrid is terminated in a 50 Ω load. To ensure signal ﬂow as shown by the

arrows in Fig. 1A, microwave isolators/circulators (not shown, see experimental schematic

in Methods) are inserted into the lines connecting each qubit to the hybrid. These provide

robust isolation between modules and connect the system output to readout electronics.

To entangle the remote qubits, ﬂying microwave single photon states are used as car-

riers of quantum information according to the protocol proposed in [8]. As outlined in

Fig. 1B, the remote entanglement protocol begins by initializing both qubit-cavity systems
(|g(cid:105) + |e(cid:105))⊗|0(cid:105), the state on the equator of the Bloch sphere with no photons in their re-
in 1√
spective cavities. Through a controlled-NOT (CNOT)-like operation, whose implementation

2

is detailed later in the text, the qubits are now entangled with ﬂying single photons where
(|g0(cid:105) + |e1(cid:105)). The joint state of all stationary
the state of each qubit-photon pair becomes 1√
2 (|gg(cid:105)|00(cid:105) + |O+(cid:105)|o+(cid:105) + |O−(cid:105)|o−(cid:105) + |ee(cid:105)|11(cid:105))
and ﬂying qubits can be expressed as |ψ(cid:105)1 = 1
(|ge(cid:105) ± |eg(cid:105)) represent the odd Bell states of the Alice and Bob qubits
where |O±(cid:105) = 1√
and |o±(cid:105) = 1√
(|10(cid:105) ± |01(cid:105)) represent the odd Bell states of ﬂying single photons in Alice’s
and Bob’s channels, respectively. The photons interfere on the 180◦ hybrid whose action,
−3π(a†b−ab†)/4. This
analogous to that of a beam-splitter, is described by the unitary UBS = e
maps |o+(cid:105) → |10(cid:105) (|o−(cid:105) → |01(cid:105)), taking the two ﬂying odd Bell states to a single photon
in the Alice or Bob branch of the system. This operation erases the which-path informa-

2

tion of the photons and produces Hong-Ou-Mandel interference[15]. After the hybrid, the
total system state is |ψ(cid:105)2 = 1
this point, the photons in the Alice channel enter the detector which distinguishes between

|ee(cid:105) (|02(cid:105) − |20(cid:105))

(cid:16)|gg(cid:105)|00(cid:105) + |O+(cid:105)|10(cid:105) + |O−(cid:105)|01(cid:105) + 1√

detecting a photon, a ‘click’, or detecting nothing, called ‘no click’. Ideally, by heralding
on only single photon detection events, the |O+(cid:105) is selected out from all the other states.

However, losses in the system between the qubits and the detector and the inability of
the detector to distinguish between |1(cid:105) and |2(cid:105) instead result in the mixed density matrix
3 = N |O+(cid:105)(cid:104)O+| + (1 − N)|ee(cid:105)(cid:104)ee| when the detector goes click. Here, the normaliza-
ρclick
tion constant N depends on loss in the system and the characteristics of the detector. In

particular, it depends on the probabilities with which it maps the input ﬂying photon states,
|1(cid:105) and |2(cid:105), to an outcome of click. Another crucial assumption in ρclick
has no dark counts, i.e. never clicks when it receives |0(cid:105). A fuller version of ρclick
including
dark counts is given in the Methods. Thus, at this stage, the qubits are in the state |O+(cid:105)
with probability N and we would like to remove the undesired |ee(cid:105) state.

is that the detector

To achieve this, a Ry(π) pulse is applied on both Alice and Bob followed by a second round

of entangling the qubits with ﬂying photons, interfering them on the hybrid and detecting
them. The π-pulse takes |ee(cid:105) → |gg(cid:105); consequently, in the second round, the unwanted
state is mapped onto |gg(cid:105)|00(cid:105), and thus it can be selected out by detecting a photon. On
the other hand, |O+(cid:105) is mapped onto a mixture of |O+(cid:105)|10(cid:105) and |O−(cid:105)|01(cid:105). Conditioning
on measuring clicks in two consecutive rounds of the protocol results in the odd Bell state
= |O+(cid:105). A result of this dual conditioning is that loss in the system only reduces
|ψ(cid:105)click, click
the success probability of the protocol and not the ﬁdelity of the generated entangled state.

6

Replacing the cold 50 Ω load with a second detector would increase the success probability
by a factor of 4 and allows for the generation of both the |O+(cid:105) and |O−(cid:105) states depending
on whether the same or diﬀerent detectors go click on each round, respectively. Since it

does not improve the ﬁdelity of entanglement, we omitted the second detector to reduce the

hardware in the dilution fridge and simplify the microwave control electronics.

Successfully realizing this protocol required simultaneously: (1) implementing the gener-

ation of single photon Fock states which are entangled with the stationary qubits and (2)

detecting the subsequent single photon states. Furthermore, the frequencies and temporal

envelopes of the photons arising from each cavity had to be controlled to ensure that the

detector cannot distinguish between them.

The ﬁrst ingredient, previously termed a CNOT-like operation, actually maps an arbitrary
qubit state α|g0(cid:105) + β |e0(cid:105), where α and β are arbitrary complex coeﬃcients, onto the joint
qubit-ﬂying photon state α|g0(cid:105) + β |e1(cid:105) (this operation is not a unitary in the manifold
{|g0(cid:105) ,|g1(cid:105) ,|e0(cid:105) ,|e1(cid:105)} because it takes |e1(cid:105) to |f 1(cid:105); however, this has no eﬀects on the
protocol since the cavity always starts in |0(cid:105)). This is done by exploiting |f(cid:105), the second

4

excited state of the transmon qubit[30], as well as the two-photon transition |f 0(cid:105) ↔ |e1(cid:105)[31,
32]. As shown in Fig. 2A, starting with the qubit in α|g(cid:105) + β |e(cid:105), the operation is realized by
ef , taking the qubit to α|g(cid:105) + β |f(cid:105), and then applying a π-pulse
ﬁrst applying a π-pulse at ω0
on the |f 0(cid:105) ↔ |e1(cid:105) with two sideband tones (ωQSB, ωCSB). This maps the qubit state onto
the joint qubit-intra-cavity state, α|g0(cid:105) + β |e1(cid:105). Finally, the photon state leaks out of the
cavity, becoming a ﬂying state that is entangled with the qubit. As a result, the traveling

photon has the frequency ωe

B) and a decaying exponential temporal waveform with the
decay constant κA (κB). The indistinguishability of the photons, then, was achieved in this

A (ωe

experiment by the nearly identical frequencies and bandwidths of the Alice and Bob cavities

(as given above and in Methods). Note that although all the photons need to be at the same

frequency, there is no requirement here for the qubits to be identical.

The second ingredient, microwave single photon detection, is the novel technical compo-

nent of our demonstration. Physically, this detector is another transmon-3D cavity system

like Alice and Bob. The strongly coupled port of the cavity is the detector input port. In the

strong dispersive regime where the qubit is operated (χD/2π = 3 MHz, κD/2π = 1 MHz), we

can selectively π-pulse the qubit conditioned on the presence of one intra-cavity photon[17],

mapping the ﬂying photon onto the state of the detector qubit. To operate this system as a
detector of single ﬂying photons, we tuned the cavity frequency ωg

D = 7.6222 GHz close to
A and ωe
ωe
B and matched the linewidths of all three cavities. This condition ensured that the
detector eﬃciency is maximized. The incident single photons from Alice and Bob will excite
the detector cavity ∼ 50% of the time (see Methods) since their decaying exponential tem-
poral waveforms are not mode-matched to the cavity. Thus, the selective π-pulse excites the

qubit only if a photon was received, with the length and timing of this pulse determining the

detector eﬃciency (see Methods). Once the photon leaks back out, a conventional cQED

dispersive readout of the qubit state[33] completes the quantum non-demolition (QND)

photon detection process. Measuring the qubit in the excited state corresponds to a photon
detection event (click). Finally, the detector is reset by returning the qubit to |g(cid:105) with an
un-selective π-pulse.

This microwave photon detector satisﬁes three important criteria in an architecture that

is easily integrated with current state-of-the art cQED experiments. First, the detector has
a reasonable eﬃciency, η ≈ 0.5, since about half of all incident photons enter the detector.
Second, this detector has low dark counts (the probability of the detector reporting a click

5

even when no photon entered the detector) Pd < 0.01, limited by the frequency selectivity

of the π-pulse. Finally, it has a short re-arm time of 450 ns determined by how long it

takes to empty the cavity and reset the qubit. We discuss avenues to further improving this

detector in the Methods section of the paper. Nevertheless, as we show below, the detector

performance is suﬃcient for generating remote entanglement.

As a preliminary step towards the realization of the full remote entanglement protocol,

we demonstrate in Fig. 2B and C signatures of entanglement between the Alice qubit and

its corresponding traveling photon state by showing that the CNOT-like operation maps
α|g0(cid:105) + β |e0(cid:105) to α|g0(cid:105) + β |e1(cid:105) (for data on the Bob qubit and simulations, see Methods).
We ﬁrst show that the relative weights of |g(cid:105) and |e(cid:105) were correctly mapped by initializing
the qubit in cos (θ/2)|g(cid:105) + sin (θ/2)|e(cid:105), followed by a π pulse on the ω0
A,ef and sideband
pulses for a varying time TSB (see Fig. 2A, right). The selective π-pulse on the detector

was a 480 ns Gaussian pulse (σ = 120 ns) and was timed such that the center of the

Gaussian coincides with the end of the sideband pulse. Finally, we measured the probability
of detecting a photon in the detector, Pclick, and the Alice polarization, (cid:104)ZA(cid:105). As shown in
Fig. 2B (black dashed line), a π-pulse on the |f 0(cid:105) ↔ |e1(cid:105) transition occurs for TSB = 254 ns
when the probability of detecting a photon, Pclick is maximized. On the other hand, for

shorter sideband pulse lengths, no photons are generated and Pclick = 0. Moreover, the

observed increase in Pclick with θ conﬁrms that the relative weight of the superposition state
between |g(cid:105) and |e(cid:105) is mapped onto |g0(cid:105) and |e1(cid:105) (Fig. 2B, left). We also conﬁrm that this
process does not destroy the qubit state by observing that the ﬁnal value of (cid:104)ZA(cid:105) agrees
with the initial preparation angle θ (Fig. 2B, right).

Furthermore, in Fig. 2C, we show that this operation also maps the phase of α|g(cid:105) + β |e(cid:105)
onto α|g0(cid:105) + β |e1(cid:105). Directly measuring the phase of |e1(cid:105) relative to |g0(cid:105) is not possible in
this experiment since the detector only detects the presence or absence of a photon. Instead,
the Alice qubit was ﬁrst prepared on the equator of the Bloch sphere in 1√

(cid:0)|g(cid:105) + eiφ |e(cid:105)(cid:1),

2

the CNOT-like operation was either performed or not and ﬁnally both Pclick, and the qubit
equatorial Bloch vector components, (cid:104)XA(cid:105) and (cid:104)YA(cid:105), were measured. When no photon is
generated, Pclick = 0 as expected and (cid:104)XA(cid:105) and (cid:104)YA(cid:105) oscillate with the preparation phase φ
(Fig. 2C, top). However, when the operation is performed, a photon is generated and thus

Pclick is now non-zero. Since, the preparation phase φ is now mapped onto the entangled

state, the measurement of the photon, either by the detector or some other loss in the system,

6

results in the unconditional dephasing of the qubit, (cid:104)XA(cid:105) ,(cid:104)YA(cid:105) = 0 (Fig. 2B, bottom).

Having demonstrated qubit-photon entanglement, we next perform the full remote en-

tanglement protocol. The ﬁnal two-qubit density matrix was measured in the Pauli basis

with joint tomography (see Methods) conditioned on detecting two clicks. For an arbi-
trary Bell state, the only non-zero Pauli components are (cid:104)ZZ(cid:105), (cid:104)XX(cid:105), (cid:104)Y Y (cid:105), (cid:104)XY (cid:105) and
(cid:104)Y Z(cid:105), which are displayed in Fig. 3. We ﬁrst demonstrate that the protocol entangles the
(|g(cid:105) + |e(cid:105)), Alice
qubits only when they start in the correct state. With Bob initialized in 1√
was prepared in cos (θ/2)|g(cid:105) + sin (θ/2)|e(cid:105). Entanglement is maximized for θ = π/2 (see
Fig. 3A dotted line), with extremal values for (cid:104)XX(cid:105), (cid:104)Y Y (cid:105), (cid:104)XY (cid:105) and (cid:104)Y X(cid:105), and with
the expected negative (cid:104)ZZ(cid:105) indicating a state of odd parity. On the other hand, for θ = 0
(θ = π), the ﬁnal two-qubit state should be the separable state |eg(cid:105) (|ge(cid:105)) as indicated by
(cid:104)XX(cid:105) = (cid:104)Y Y (cid:105) = (cid:104)XY (cid:105) = (cid:104)Y X(cid:105) = 0 and (cid:104)ZZ(cid:105) < 0. We attribute the deviation of (cid:104)ZZ(cid:105)
from −1 to the dark counts in the detector and the ﬁnite T1’s of the two qubits.

2

Next, we show that when both qubits are initialized along the equator of the Bloch sphere,
(|g(cid:105) + |e(cid:105)) with Bob

remote entanglement is always generated. Alice was now prepared in 1√
prepared in 1√

(cid:0)|g(cid:105) + eiφ |e(cid:105)(cid:1). In this case, the ﬁnal state should be 1√

2

(cid:0)|ge(cid:105) + ei(φ+φoﬀ) |eg(cid:105)(cid:1),

2

where φoﬀ is an arbitrary oﬀset phase included to account for frequency oﬀsets and path

length diﬀerences between the two ﬂying photons. This Bell state is witnessed by the
tomography results in Fig. 3B, where (cid:104)ZZ(cid:105) is constant and negative while the other four
displayed Pauli components follow the expected sinusoidal behavior. From the ﬁts to the

data, we extract φoﬀ = 3π/10.

The complete density matrix, ρmeas, is shown in Fig. 4 (left) in the Pauli basis for φ given
by the dotted line in Fig. 3B, where the ﬁdelity F = Tr (ρmeas |O+(cid:105)(cid:104)O+|) is maximum. The
theoretically calculated density matrix, (Fig. 4, right), includes the eﬀects of the coherence

times of the Alice and Bob qubits, T2Bell, the imperfections of the detector and the imper-

fections in the joint tomography (see Methods). As expected, most of the state information

lies in the two-qubit Pauli components rather than the single-qubit ones. The measured
ﬁdelity F = 0.53± 0.01 and concurrence C = 0.1± 0.01[34] exceed the entanglement thresh-
old. When accounting for systematic errors in tomography (see Methods), we obtain the
corrected ﬁdelity Fcorr = 0.57 ± 0.01. This ﬁdelity can be understood as a result of various
imperfections in the entanglement generation protocol: (1) decoherence of the two qubits
which limits the ﬁdelity to FT2Bell and (2) imperfections of the detector which are character-

7

ized by Fdet. From the measured value of T2Bell = 6 µs and the protocol time, Tseq = 2.5 µs,
∼= 0.8. The inﬁdelity associated with the imperfect detector is characterized
we expect FT2Bell
by the dark count ratio Pd/Pclick, which is the fraction of detection events that are reported

as clicks even though no actual photon was sent. In this experiment, Pd/Pclick = 0.05, pri-

marily limited by the ﬁnite selectivity of the detection pulse and the imperfect readout of

∼= 0.9. A theoretical model incorporating these two
the detector qubit, which results in Fdet
imperfections was used to calculate an expected ﬁdelity Fthy = 0.76 (see Methods). The

remaining inﬁdelity is a result of sources that are harder to characterize and will need to be

explored in further work, like, for instance, the imperfections of the CNOT-like operation

and the distinguishability of the photons. Nevertheless, the current results clearly establish

the viability of this protocol and, by extension, the modular architecture for superconducting

qubits.

Another ﬁgure of merit for this experiment is the entanglement generation rate which is

determined by the repetition rate, Trep = 21 µs, and the success probability of the experi-

ment. The latter is determined by the product of state initialization via post-selection (57%)

and the detector click probability in the ﬁrst (8%) and second (9%) rounds respectively lead-

ing to an overall success probability of 0.4%. The corresponding generation rate of about
200 s−1 is orders of magnitude faster than similar experiments performed with nitrogen-
vacancy centers in diamond (2 × 10−3 s−1)[3], neutral atoms (9 × 10−3 s−1)[2] or trapped
ion systems (4.5 s−1)[35]. We note, however, that our generation rate does not yet cross the
threshold for fault tolerance[7, 35] though there are many prospects for enhancement.

Improvements in generation rate and ﬁdelity are possible with readily available upgrades

to the hardware and software of our experiment. Firstly, a factor of 4 increase in success

can be achieved by installing the omitted second detector. Secondly, shaping the generated

photons and detection pulse to mode match the ﬂying photons to the detector would in-

crease the detection eﬃciency by at least 50% and hence multiply the generation rate by at

least a factor of 2. Moreover, this would reduce both the dark count fraction and the distin-

guishability of the traveling photons which would directly beneﬁt the entanglement ﬁdelity

by bringing Fdet closer to unity. Thirdly, an order of magnitude better coherence times for

the two qubits have been demonstrated in similar 3D qubit-cavity systems[36], which should
readily carry over to this experiment and improve FT2Bell. Finally, the overall throughput of
the experiment can be increased by an order of magnitude by the use of real-time feedback

8

capabilities that have been recently demonstrated for superconducting qubits[37, 38].

In this work, we have demonstrated, in a single experiment, the set of tools that had

been previously the exclusive privilege of quantum optics experiments: the availability of

ﬂying microwave single photon sources and detectors together with the spatial and tempo-

ral control of traveling photons to make them indistinguishable. With these tools, we have

realized two-photon interference of microwave photons and the generation of loss-tolerant

entanglement between distant superconducting qubits with concurrent measurements. The

protocol speed and prospects for improving ﬁdelity make this a very promising implementa-

tion for remote entanglement and the distribution of quantum information with microwave

ﬂying photons. Thus, this experiment opens for superconducting qubits the new prospect

of modular quantum information.

Figure 1 | Experiment and protocol schematic for remote entanglement of
transmon qubits using ﬂying single microwave photons. A) Two superconducting

3D transmon qubits, Alice and Bob, are connected by coaxial cables to the two input ports of

the microwave equivalent of a 50/50 beam-splitter. One of the output ports of the splitter is

connected to a microwave single photon detector also realized by a 3D transmon qubit. The

other port of the splitter is terminated in a cold 50 Ω load. B) Quantum circuit diagram of

the remote entanglement protocol, with the states of the quantum system at various steps.

action UBS erases their which-path information. Following a π-pulse on Alice and Bob, the

CNOT-like operation and beam-splitter steps are repeated to remove contributions of the
unwanted |ee(cid:105) state. Detecting two photon clicks in a pair of consecutive rounds heralds the
|O+(cid:105) = 1√

(|ge(cid:105) + |eg(cid:105)) Bell state of Alice and Bob.

The colors denote transitions which are driven to perform the CNOT-like operation and

ﬂying single photon detection. The Alice qubit is prepared in an arbitrary initial state by
the pulse Rge

by a pair of sideband pulses. The sideband pulses are applied at ωQSB, detuned by ∆ from
ωef , and ωCSB, detuned by ∆ from ωe

π-pulse is applied to the detector qubit at ω1
