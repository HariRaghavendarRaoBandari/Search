Abstract

We report on the ﬁrst observation of stationary light pulses and narrowband light storage inside a

hollow-core photonic crystal ﬁber. Laser-cooled atoms were ﬁrst loaded into the ﬁber core providing

strong light-matter coupling. Light pulses were then stored in a collective atomic excitation using

a single control laser beam. By applying a second counterpropagating control beam, a light pulse

could be brought to a standstill. Our work paves the way towards the creation of strongly-correlated

many-body systems with photons and applications in the ﬁeld of quantum information processing.

Introduction.—Achieving strong coupling of light and matter is a long pursued goal in the

ﬁeld of quantum optics. Not only does it allow for large linear light storage eﬃciencies [1],

e.g., using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [2–4] or a gradient-echo technique

[5, 6]. It also sets the ground for quantum nonlinear optics (NLO), where strong interactions

between individual photons can be mediated via coupling through the medium [7]. This

would, e.g., enable all-optical quantum networks [8], the creation of strongly-correlated light-

matter systems [9–11], single-photon switches [12], or the simulation of relativistic theories

with photons [13].

Strong NLO interactions at the single-photon level have already been demonstrated, e.g.,

using long-range atom-atom interactions [14–17] or placing atoms into high-ﬁnesse cavities

[18, 19]. However, NLO interactions as proposed in [9–13] using atomic ensembles coupled

to one-dimensional (1D) waveguides are still waiting for their experimental realization. The

ﬁrst requirement for their successful realization is strong light-matter coupling. The coupling

strength of light to an ensemble of Natom atoms for linear interactions, such as light storage
in a collective atomic excitation, is determined by the optical depth OD =− ln T , with the
resonant transmission T [1]. For nonlinear interactions the simultaneous interaction of an

atom with multiple photons is required. Here, the relevant quantity is the OD per atom
OD∗=OD/Natom≈σa/Aw, i.e., the probability of an atom (absorption cross section σa) to
interact with a photon of the guided mode (mode area Aw) [7]. Impressive results have been

achieved with atoms coupled to photonic nanowaveguides [20, 21] and nanoﬁbers [22, 23].

On the other hand, hollow-core photonic crystal ﬁbers (HCPCFs) loaded with atoms [24–27]
allow for larger ODs at the expense of a smaller OD∗ due to a larger mode area [24, 27–29].
The second requirement for the realization of the aforementioned experiments is the creation

of stationary light pulses (SLPs), i.e., light pulses with a quasi-stationary envelope [30],

based on EIT with a Kerr-type nonlinearity [12, 31, 32] (see Fig. 1). Without the coupling
to state |4(cid:105) the Λ-type system shown in Fig. 1(a) gives rise to EIT [2]. Due to quantum
interference the strong control ﬁeld renders an opaque medium transparent for the weak

(copropagating) probe ﬁeld near two-photon resonance at ∆p=∆c. Dark-state polaritons

(DSPs) [33] are formed whose group velocity can be controlled by the Rabi frequency Ωc

of the control [34]. By adiabatically switching oﬀ the control while the DSPs are created,

the probe ﬁeld is mapped onto a non-propagating long-lived collective atomic excitation. It

can be retrieved by reapplying the control. This is termed light storage and retrieval [35]

2

and has led, e.g., to impressive light storage times [36]. As no light is present inside the

medium during the storage period, NLO interactions are not possible. However, when a

second counterpropagating control beam is added (see Fig. 1(b)) while the DSPs propagate

through the medium, an all-optical cavity is created. The DSPs are eﬀectively stopped with

a non-vanishing photonic component and a quasi-stationary envelope [30, 37], i.e., light

pulses are trapped without a physical cavity. Although the envelope is quasi-stationary, the

DSPs within the pulse still jitter back and forth with ﬁnite group velocity. With a Kerr-
type coupling to a state |4(cid:105) being present this results in (in)elastic collisions of the DSPs,
depending on the magnitude of the detunings ∆p,k [12]. Thus, NLO interactions using SLPs

become possible [38, 39].

Towards the goal of implementing eﬃcient ﬁber-based linear and NLO interactions at the

quantum level, in our work we present now the experimental implementation of narrowband

EIT in a cold 1D ensemble with large optical depth up to OD=400 (i.e. two orders of mag-

nitude larger than in previous experiments [40]), the ﬁrst demonstration of light storage and

retrieval, and the ﬁrst observation of SLPs in a HCPCF loaded with cold atoms. We com-

pare our results to elaborated numerical simulations. Finally we discuss strategies towards

future applications.

Experiment.—A schematic overview of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2(a).

We loaded laser-cooled 87Rb atoms from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) into the core of
a vertically aligned HCPCF (HC-800-02, NKT Photonics, core diameter ∼7 µm) [28] at a
rate of 0.76 Hz. A nearly Gaussian-shaped red-detuned far-oﬀ-resonant trap (FORT) [41]
(trap depth ∼5 mK inside the HCPCF) prevented collisions of the cold atoms with the
room-temperature ﬁber wall, allowing for guiding and tight conﬁnement of the atoms. The

repumper beam of the MOT. For a 5 mK deep FORT a temperature around 450 µK of

the atoms inside the HCPCF can be expected. However, due to an unresolved heating
mechanism, the temperature varied day by day between 350 µK≤Θ≤1.1 mK [27, 28]. To
avoid inhomogeneous broadening by the deep FORT, we modulated the trap depth with
an on-oﬀ ratio of ≥14 dB and ωmod=2π×250 kHz. This provided up to 50 measurement
periods τmeas≤3 µs each, with insigniﬁcant losses and one-photon transition shifts <0.2Γ
(Γ=2π×6.07 MHz is the excited state linewidth).

We implemented the Λ scheme for EIT as shown in Fig. 1(b) with |1(cid:105)=|52S1/2, F =1(cid:105),
|2(cid:105)=|52S1/2, F =2(cid:105), and |3(cid:105)=|52P3/2, F (cid:48)=1(cid:105). With these couplings EIT is achieved for all
possible transitions between Zeeman levels for an arbitrary polarization of the laser ﬁelds

due to the birefringence typical for HCPCFs [42, 43]. Two external-cavity diode lasers,

locked [44] with a relative bandwidth of 8 kHz during an integration period of 3.5 s provided

the probe and control ﬁelds. Magnetic stray ﬁelds were compensated by a 3D magnetic

oﬀset ﬁeld which had to be adjusted slightly day by day.

The weak probe ﬁeld (3.5 pW ≤ Pp ≤ 700 pW) was ﬁltered from the much stronger
and exactly collinear forward control ﬁeld (50 nW ≤ Pc ≤ 1.9 µW) after the HCPCF for
detection with a photon counter (PerkinElmer, SPCM AQRH-12) by a monolithic etalon

[45] combined with polarization and spatial ﬁltering [27]. The detection eﬃciency of the

probe was 10 % and the relative attenuation of the control was 64 dB. We always kept the
probe power low enough to fulﬁll Ωp(cid:28)Ωc and to have much smaller densities of the probe
photons than the atoms, as required for DSP propagation [34]. We counted the output

pulses of the SPCM either directly with a counterboard (NI, PCI-6602) or with a digital

storage oscilloscope (Agilent, DSO1014A) followed by software analysis. For further details

on the experimental setup we refer the reader to [28] and the Supplemental Material at the

end of this document.

Simulations.— In order to compare our measurements to theoretical predictions and to

characterize our setup we set up several numerical simulations. Due to the changing elliptical

light polarization inside the HCPCF and a potentially small remaining magnetic ﬁeld, we

chose to model our experiments assuming an isotropic polarization using eﬀective dipole

moments [see Eqn. (43) in [47]] in all simulations. We extended the theoretical models

typically used to simulate the transmission through a ﬁber loaded with atoms [27] and pulse

propagation in a medium driven by EIT with counterpropagating control ﬁelds [48–50] to
incorporate the oﬀ-resonant states |52P3/2, F (cid:48)=0,2,3(cid:105). This is necessary as for OD(cid:38)130 the
resonances of the D2 line start to overlap. Also, inhomogeneous broadening of the two-

photon resonance due to the radially inhomogeneous control ﬁelds Ωc(r) and the atomic

density proﬁle n(r) determined by the FORT potential and the temperature Θ [41] have to

be considered. The transmission is then given by

with the measured mode ﬁeld 1/e radius σpc of the probe/control beams, the normalized probe

ﬁeld proﬁle Ωp(r) and the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution p(v) for the temperature Θ. The

absorption coeﬃcient α(∆p) was taken from [51] and adjusted to the current coupling scheme
while state |52P3/2, F (cid:48)=3(cid:105) was adiabatically eliminated (see Supplemental Material at the
end of this document for further details). We assumed the ground state decoherence rate

γ21=γttb to be dominated by transit-time broadening [52]. Only the number of atoms Natom

inside the HCPCF and Θ were free parameters. The other parameters were initially chosen

according to the measurements and were then allowed to be changed within the experimental

uncertainties to best reproduce the measured data.

A comparison of the transmission spectra for homogeneous and inhomogeneous laser

ﬁelds and medium, respectively, shows that the inhomogeneities can be included in the (ho-

mogeneous) 1D simulation by using eﬀective control Rabi frequencies Ωeﬀ
c = βΩc and an
additional decoherence rate γinh∝Ω2
c, Θ2 due to inhomogeneous broadening. For the values
of Θ and Ωc used in our experiment we have γinh>γttb. Although this allows one in general
to discuss the experimental data in terms of EIT window width ∆ωEIT = (Ωeﬀ
OD
compared to the decoherence rate γ21≈γinh, things are more complicated due to incoher-
ent absorption by state |52P3/2, F (cid:48)=0(cid:105) in our multi-level system. For simulating the pulse
propagation through the medium under EIT conditions we either used a convolution of the

√

probe pulse and the spectral transmission function T (∆p, Θ) in 3D, or we solved the 1D

Maxwell-Bloch equations [49, 50] using Ωeﬀ

c and γinh [46]. The latter method was also used

to simulate light storage and SLPs.

Results & Discussion.— Figure 2(b) shows the transmission through the HCPCF as a

function of probe laser detuning for two diﬀerent ODs. Each data point corresponds to

Navg=50 averages measured during a gate time of τg=680 ns. In the absence of EIT the

medium can be rendered highly opaque over a broad frequency range depending on the num-

ber of atoms loaded into the ﬁber. By switching on the control beam during the measurement

for the same conditions, the typical transmission window of EIT appears [Fig. 2(c)]. The

detuning ∆+

c >0 was here adjusted to compensate the two-photon ac Stark shift. The tem-
perature of the medium was Θ=500(100) µK [γttb=0.008(1)Γ] according to the simulations.
This is in agreement with the expected lower temperature limit for the ∼5 mK deep FORT.
Whereas we observed almost complete transmission for a moderate OD (black squares), the

maximum transmission reaches only 25 % for a high OD (red circles). According to our
simulation, 30 % of the absorption are due to incoherent absorption by state |52P3/2, F (cid:48)=0(cid:105)
which is not coupled by the control due to selection rules. We therefore chose OD(cid:46)140 for
all following experiments to avoid a resonance overlap.

Using the steep dispersion within the EIT transparency window, the group velocity vg of a

probe pulse can be signiﬁcantly reduced as compared to the vacuum value c [2]. As the pulse

is simultaneously spatially compressed by vg/c, it can be stored eﬃciently inside a medium

Γ OD/Ω2

c [34]. With the experimentally determined Ωc (measuring the transmitted power
and considering the losses of the optics) this allows one to determine the OD independently

from the transmission spectra. Both results agree well within the experimental uncertainties.

In Fig. 3(a) we show the delays of an incident probe pulse (black squares) for constant Ω+

c and
varying OD (Navg=1250, τg=60 ns). The delay increases linearly with the OD in accordance

with the theoretical expectation (see inset). The probe pulse can be delayed by more than

one pulse length, i.e., it can be compressed such that it completely ﬁts inside the medium.

We note that only by including the radially inhomogeneous proﬁles Ωp,c(r) and n(r), the

simulations show good agreement with the measurements for realistic parameters.

By adiabatically switching oﬀ the control ﬁeld while the probe pulse is inside the medium,

we can now map the probe pulse onto a collective atomic excitation [2, 35]. Switching on

the same control ﬁeld after a certain storage time leads to a retrieval of the probe ﬁeld

into its original direction. Figure 3(b) shows the incident probe pulse (black squares),

the delayed pulse without storage (orange circles), and the retrieved pulses for diﬀerent

storage times ∆τ (blue triangles, red diamonds and green stars; Navg=1250, τg=60 ns).

The probe pulse is attenuated by 63 % as it moves through the medium (orange circles).

This attenuation cannot be solely attributed to decoherence by transit-time broadening, but

requires the inclusion of inhomogeneous broadening [γinh=0.015(1)Γ] by the control while
c (t)(cid:54)=0 in the eﬀective 1D simulation. Once the pulse is temporarily stored [Ω+
Ω+
c (t)=0], it
decays exponentially (black dashed line) with a decoherence rate γ21=0.009(1)Γ dominated

by transit-time broadening (γttb=0.008Γ) for a temperature of 450(50) µK. We note that

this exponential decay was achieved after careful suppression of the stray magnetic ﬁeld

[53]. Before, collapses and revivals as in [54] were observed. The eﬃciency, deﬁned as
output/input pulse area, is η=23(5) % for 0.6 µs of storage. This is about 2× (8×) larger
than for similar measurements performed with nanoﬁbers [54, 55] (with similar decoherence

rates) due to the larger OD but also larger inhomogeneous broadening. As shown in [56]

in free space, the light storage period could be signiﬁcantly extended also inside a HCPCF,

thereby combining large storage eﬃciency and period for future quantum networks.

Finally, we turn to the creation of SLPs. Figure 3(c) shows the transmission of an

incident probe pulse (black squares) through the HCPCF when driven under slow light and

SLP conditions (Navg=250, τg=100 ns). As before, Ω+

c was ﬁrst adjusted (with Ω−

c =0) to ﬁt

Then the counterpropagating control

(red dashed line) was applied as the probe pulse was inside the medium. During the time

when the medium is driven by the two counterpropagating control ﬁelds the transmission

through the ﬁber is signiﬁcantly suppressed (red diamonds). Switching oﬀ the backward

control ﬁeld again, retrieves the remaining coherence, i.e., a light pulse from the medium

(see Fig. 3(c) inset). The retrieval eﬃciency is η=2.8(6) % and occurs at times where there

should not be anymore coherence left inside the medium for a continuously propagating

pulse. This is the typical signature of SLPs at moderate ODs when the probe pulse just ﬁts
c (t)(cid:54)=0 can be explained
inside the medium [30, 37]. The transmitted light detected when Ω±

This is also conﬁrmed by the numerical simulation (red solid line). As the two-photon
Doppler shifts (k±
c )v were smaller than ∆ωEIT, we applied a relative detuning (∆+
c -
∆−
c )=3.5Γ>∆ωEIT=2.9Γ to avoid excitation of coherences suppressing the SLPs [37, 49, 50].
For ∆−
c no pulse could be retrieved, as expected for a cold medium [37]. Due to the
ground state frequency diﬀerence of ∆ω21=2π×6.835 GHz and the exact 1D alignment of
all laser beams a phase mismatch is present which must be compensated by a two-photon
detuning δpm=−∆ω21vg/c [48]. If δpm(cid:38)∆ωEIT this leads to strong attenuation of the SLPs.
This eﬀect becomes negligible for media of large OD and correspondingly large group delays,

however, it has to be considered in our experiment. Therefore, we set the detunings ∆+
p,c

such that an eﬀective negative two-photon detuning within the EIT window width was

realized (taking into account the ac Stark shifts by the control). Without an initial two-

photon detuning, no SLPs could be observed. Unlike for phase-matched conditions [37],
we obtained the largest retrieval eﬃciency for Ω−

simulations for our parameters with comparable δpm, ∆ωEIT, and pulse bandwidth ∆ωp.

The simulations show that the ratio Ω−
Our explanation for this is as follows: The phase mismatch is relevant only for excitation

of the backward propagating ﬁeld [46]. When not all frequencies of the probe pulse can

be phase matched, the resulting suppression of the backward propagating ﬁeld has to be
c to achieve an eﬀective SLP. As ∆ωp, δpm(cid:28)∆ωEIT
compensated by a stronger coupling Ω−
good phase matching for all probe frequencies becomes possible and SLPs are formed again

for balanced coupling.

Outlook.— In view of the goal of achieving eﬃcient light storage and NLO interactions at

9

the single-photon limit the following steps have to be taken. (i) The relative extinction ratio
of probe and control beams must be improved by ∼20 dB to reach the interesting single-
photon regime. This is technically feasible by improved polarization ﬁltering as shown for a

similar ﬁlter [45]. (ii) Incoherent (oﬀ-resonant) absorption must be suppressed to allow for

larger ODs and hence larger light storage and SLP eﬃciencies. This can be achieved by using

the D1 instead of the D2 line with a fewer number of excited states and the approx. 5-fold

larger hyperﬁne splitting [47]. (iii) Inhomogeneous broadening by the control itself must be
reduced to maintain the condition ∆ωEIT(cid:29)γ21 also at larger ODs. Cooling the atoms inside
the 1D FORT, as, e.g., demonstrated in [57, 58], will reduce decoherence, inhomogeneous

broadening, and heating-induced losses, resulting in larger probe transmission, ODs, and

longer averaging times. Collisional thermalization in 3D will be possible at our present
atomic densities of 1012 cm−3 [28] resulting in temperatures well below the Doppler limit
[58].

In conclusion, we demonstrated the creation of SLPs and narrowband light storage using

EIT inside a HCPCF for the ﬁrst time. Good agreement between numerical simulations

and the experiments was found when considering the radially inhomogeneous laser beams

and atomic density inside the ﬁber. The light storage eﬃciency was limited to around
23(5) % at a decoherence rate of γ21=2π×64 kHz dominated by transit-time broadening.
The minimum number of photons per pulse was ∼70. The OD per atom was OD∗=0.0037(6)
for the transition used, in agreement with previous results. We discussed several strategies

for improving the experiment towards the goal of reaching linear and NLO interactions at the

single-photon regime. Our work therefore paves the way towards a multitude of experiments

requiring strong light-matter interactions in the ﬁeld of quantum and nonlinear optics.

FIG. 4 (color online). Level scheme of 87Rb used for the simulation of transmission and propagation.

We consider the level scheme corresponding to the D2 line of 87Rb with degenerate Zeeman levels shown

driven by two strong counterpropagating control ﬁelds of Rabi frequencies Ω±

and substitute these into the Bloch equations (4)-(7). After substitution we obtain an inﬁnite series of

truncated for a suitable n > nmax determined by the temperature of the medium or the relative detuning
|ζ| [2, 3]. While nmax = 0 for a room-temperature medium, this approximation can also be done for cold
atoms when the relative detunings of the counterpropagating control ﬁelds or the corresponding Doppler

We note that the time-dependent Stark shift ∆S is included in the detunings ∆±

c and the Doppler

shifts ±kvatom are included in the detunings ∆±

p,c. An average over the thermal velocity distribution for

17

given temperature Θ can therefore be taken [2, 3]. The ground state decoherence rate γ21 = γttb + γinh is

determined by transit-time broadening γttb (depending on the temperature Θ of the atoms inside the ﬁber)

[6], and an eﬀective contribution γinh due to the inhomogeneous broadening by the spatially varying control

beams and atomic density (see Sec. I C). We neglect the contribution of the relative linewidth γlock of the
probe and control beams, since γlock (cid:28) γ21. To further account for the radially inhomogeneous distributions
of atomic density and Rabi frequencies, we also use eﬀective Rabi frequencies Ωeﬀ = βΩ determined from

simulated transmission spectra (see Sec.I C). We then numerically solve Eqns. (12)-(16) to simulate slow

light, light storage and retrieval, and SLPs with nmax=3.

C. EIT transmission spectra

We calculate transmission spectra T (∆+

cally eliminated) under EIT conditions with a single control ﬁeld Ω+

p,c ≡ 0 and
p,c = Ωp,c in the equations above. The Hamiltonian and the Bloch equations are therefore

c as follows. We set Ω−

p,c = ∆−

we substitute Ω+
the same as in the previous section, however, with all couplings in the −z direction set to 0.

For obtaining the stationary transmission, we derive the stationary solution of Eqns. (4)-(7), using the
ij = 0 for all (i, j) (cid:54)= (1, 1) as before. From here we obtain the

same initial conditions ρ(0)

with OD = n0 σatom L where n0 is the atomic density, σatom is the absorption cross section, and L is the

length of the medium.

To include the radially inhomogeneous Rabi frequencies Ω(r) and atomic density n(r) depending on the

radial distance r from the ﬁber axis, we obtain the transmission through the ﬁber with cylindrical symmetry
as follows. The Rabi frequencies Ωp,c(r) = Ωp,c(0) exp (−r2/σ2
pc) with the measured mode ﬁeld 1/e radius
of the intensity σpc of the probe/control beams simply replaces the constant Rabi frequencies in Eqn. (17).
The radial atomic density distribution is n(r) = n0 exp (−r2/σ2
a), with the 1/e radius σa as determined by
the temperature Θ of the atoms inside the FORT potential of known depth [7].

The transmission through the inhomogeneous medium inside the ﬁber is then given by

with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution p(vatom) for the temperature Θ.

The parameters β and γinh that include the eﬀect of the inhomogeneities and are used for solving the

Maxwell-Bloch equations (see Sec. I B) are determined by comparing the results of Eqns. (18) and (19) for

the homogeneous/inhomogeneous cases with β and γinh included in the homogeneous transmission function.

We then adjust β and γinh for all other parameters being identical, until the transmission of both spectra

is the same within <1 %. As β and γinh depend on the temperature Θ and the control Rabi frequencies,

they are determined for each of them individually in the range of our experimental parameters.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Fiber loading procedure – We ﬁrst loaded about N0 = 107 rubidium atoms into a standard vapor

cell magneto-optical trap (MOT) with rectangular coil geometry [8]. After a loading period of 1 s we

transferred the atom cloud down towards the tip of a vertically oriented hollow-core photonic crystal ﬁber
(HCPCF, HC-800-02, NKT Photonics), located ∼5.5 mm away from the center of the MOT, by shifting the
magnetic zero point of the MOT with an oﬀset magnetic ﬁeld. Simultaneously, we compressed the cloud

by ramping up the current in the quadrupole coils of the MOT to achieve a gradient of 15 G/cm. To avoid

density-limiting light-assisted collisions near the HCPCF, we used the so-called dark spot technique [9] to

create a dark funnel for the atoms [10]. While the atom cloud was held above the ﬁber tip they could fall

into a near Gaussian-shaped red-detuned far-oﬀ-resonant trap (FORT) [7] located inside the HCPCF. The

FORT was realized by coupling radiation at a wavelength of 855 nm and a power of 270 mW (corresponding
to a trap depth of ∼5 mK) into the HCPCF. The FORT therefore prevented collisions of the laser-cooled
rubidium atoms with the room-temperature ﬁber wall, allowing for guiding and a tight conﬁnement of the

atoms. With this setup, we were able to load up to 2.5 % of the atoms into the HCPCF, resulting in an

OD of up to 1000 [10]. The total number of atoms Natom loaded into the ﬁber could be controlled by the
power of the repumper beam tuned to the transition |1(cid:105) → |5(cid:105) which forms the dark funnel. The loading
process of the HCPCF was repeated every 1.3 s. For further experimental details on the loading procedure

we refer the reader to [10].

Detection of the atoms inside the ﬁber – To guarantee interaction with only the atoms inside the HCPCF

during any of the here presented experiments, we switched oﬀ the magnetic ﬁeld of the MOT 14 ms earlier

and pumped the region above the ﬁber continuously with the repumper beam (tuned to the transition
|1(cid:105) → |5(cid:105)) with a power of 600 µW and a diameter of 2 mm (1/e2) once the ﬁber was loaded. The atoms
inside the HCPCF were optically pumped into state |F =1(cid:105) by the control laser.

Fast FORT modulation – The FORT was modulated by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) placed

between the diode laser and the tapered ampliﬁer of our MOPA system [10]. Although the 90–20 % fall

time was 170 ns, the rf power of the AOM driver oscillator would decay with a time constant of 260 ns (1/e)

19

thereafter leading to non-negligible ac Stark shifts during the measurements within the short measurement
periods of τmeas ≤ 3 µs. This eﬀect was qualitatively observed for diﬀerent commercial and home-built
drivers. To overcome this problem we used an additional fast absorptive switch (MiniCircuits, ZYSWA-2-

50DR) between oscillator and ampliﬁer of the AOM driver. The resulting 90–10 % fall- and risetime was
then 95 ns with a suppression of ≥ 14 dB of the FORT during the measurements. This is suﬃcient to reduce
the trap depth to < 225 µK, which is below the temperature of the atoms, and to an ac Stark shift of less
than 0.2 Γ of the transition |2(cid:105) → |3(cid:105).

Magnetic shielding – Although the central part of the HCPCF was shielded from magnetic stray ﬁelds

by a layer of µ-metal, the regions within around 2 cm from the ﬁber tips were not shielded. We therefore

observed an eﬀect of the (decaying) quadrupole ﬁeld of the MOT on the light storage eﬃciency by showing a

beating of the retrieval eﬃciency [11, 12]. This eﬀect could however be compensated by applying a suitable

3D magnetic oﬀset ﬁeld following the procedure in [11]. This oﬀset ﬁeld had to be adjusted slightly day by

day.

Light Polarization – Probe and control laser beams were launched with linear orthogonal polarizations

into the HCPCF. Due to the typical birefringence of HCPCFs [13] and non-perfect input coupling [14] the
light ﬁelds were elliptically polarized inside the ﬁber (degree of linear polarization ∼90 % after the ﬁber).
For the chosen coupling scheme, however, EIT conditions for all possible Zeeman transitions are achieved.

Probe detection – In order to separate the weak probe ﬁeld (3.5 pW ≤ Pprobe ≤ 700 pW) from the
much stronger and exactly collinear forward control ﬁeld (50 nW ≤ Pcontrol ≤ 1.7 µW) after the HCPCF
for detection with a photon counter (PerkinElmer, SPCM AQRH-12), we proceeded as follows. First, the

light exiting the ﬁber was passing a polarization beam splitter. Then the light was spatially ﬁltered by

a single-mode ﬁber [15]. Finally we used a combination of a monolithic etalon, polarization ﬁlter and a

second spatial ﬁlter [16] by coupling the light into a single-mode ﬁber leading to the photon counter. This

led to a detection eﬃciency of 10 % for the probe and a relative extinction ratio of 64 dB for the control beam.
