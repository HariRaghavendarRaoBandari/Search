In simple colloidal suspensions, clusters are various multimers that result from colloid self-association and
exist in equilibrium with monomers.There are two types of potentials that are known to produce clusters: a)
potentials that result from the competition between short-range attraction and long-range repulsion and are
characterized by a global minimum and a repulsive tail and b) purely repulsive potentials which have a soft
shoulder. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate in this work that potentials with a local minimum and
a repulsive tail, not belonging to either of the known types, are also capable of generating clusters. A detailed
comparative analysis shows that the new type of cluster-forming potential serves as a bridge between the other
two. The new clusters are expanded in shape and their assembly is driven by entropy, like in the purely repulsive
systems but only at low density. At high density, clusters are collapsed and stabilized by energy, in common with
the systems with competing attractive and repulsive interactions.

1. Introduction

The term “clusters” refers to a large variety of objects that range in size from small multimers to
mesoscopic domains [1] and arise as a consequence of monomer self-association in a large variety of soft
materials [2]. Most often, clusters are discussed in reference to colloidal suspensions [3], where they exist
in equilibrium with monomers, but they were also reported for proteins [4], synthetic clays [5] and metal
nanoparticles [6]. Equilibrium clusters become the dominant species in the solution at appropriate ther-
modynamic conditions. They may also arise transiently, as a consequence of arrested phase transition [7].
As a particular case of the self-assembly process, cluster formation is of key interest to basic research,
in particular condensed matter physics. Additionally, it also has appreciable practical applications, for
instance as a drug-delivery vehicle [8]. Clusters are capable of signiﬁcantly altering the mechanical prop-
erties of aqueous solutions in which they assemble. This is the case, for instance, of solutions containing
monoclonal antibodies, a known biopharmaceutical, which experience a considerable viscosity increase
if clusters are present [9]. It is imperative, therefore, to develop a basic understanding of the principles
underlying the formation of clusters, in order to use these systems successfully for therapeutic purposes.
Historically, it seems, the possibility of clusters emerging spontaneously in a homogeneous ﬂuid was
ﬁrst raised within the concept of competing interactions. When discussing phase transitions in systems
interacting via attractive potentials, Lebowitz and Penrose [10] asked about the effect of an additional
repulsive part in the potential, whose range is longer than that of the attractive part. Their conclusion
was that the liquid formed as a result of the normal ﬁrst-order gas-liquid transition due to the attraction
among particles would break into ﬁnite-size droplets whose size is large compared to the size of the col-
loid but small compared to the range of the repulsion. Over the past forty years, this scenario was seen to

play out in a variety of systems, interacting by a variety of potentials. Kendrick et al. [11] considered a sys-
tem of colloids interacting via repulsive Coulomb and attractive van der Waals forces and concluded that
as a result of the competition between these two interactions, the critical point between the low density
liquid phase and the high-density liquid phase is ‘preempted by a ﬁnite wave vector critical point’ [11]. As
a result of the new phase transition, macrophases with inhomogeneous density distributions are formed.
The same idea of competition between short-range attractive and long-range repulsive forces (SALR) in
simple ﬂuids was later researched by Sear et al. [12, 13] in the context of colloids lying on the air-water
interface. Analytic mean-ﬁeld theory [13] and computer simulations [12] indicated that, indeed, instead
of the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), colloids form various patterned (modulated) phases, includ-
ing ﬁnite-size clusters. In many respects, these were similar to the patterns created by the competition
between repulsion and attraction and described previously for complex ﬂuids [14, 15]. Further progress
was made with the work of Groenewold and Kegel [16] who showed how an elaborated model describ-
ing the amount of charge on a colloidal surface may lead to the stabilization of clusters of large size.
Since that publication, a large amount of work on SALR clusters has followed (see references [17, 18]
and references therein) focusing mainly on how the LLPS line is broken/modiﬁed by the presence of the
repulsion in the potential. A sophisticated and accurate self-consistent Ornstein-Zernike approximation
(SCOZA) within the integral-equation theory of the liquid state was used by the group of Reatto [19, 20]
to delineate the line in the phase diagram separating the homogeneous ﬂuid phase from the cluster ﬂuid
phase, or the so-called λ-line. The SCOZA predictions were later compared to the results of a density-
functional theory [21] and simulation [22]. A partial list of other topics that have been covered includes:
a) the effect of the attraction range [23, 24], b) the height of the barrier [25], and c) the role of the tail in
the potential [26–30].

The second class of systems for which clusters have been reported are colloids interacting via repul-
sive potentials with a soft shoulder [2]. Stell and Hemmer pointed out in a seminal work [31] that due
to the additional length scale, one set by the size of the colloid and the other by the size of the shoulder,
such potentials possess very unusual properties. In addition to the usual gas-liquid transition ending in
a critical point, for instance, potentials with shoulders may exhibit a liquid-liquid transition, which also
ends in a critical point. There have been numerous follow-up studies that focused on the speciﬁc details
of the new phase transitions as well as on whether or not this model is capable of explaining the thermo-
dynamic anomalies of liquid water [32–36]. It was not until the work of Klein et al. [37] that clusters were
made the speciﬁc subject of such studies. Using analytical theory and computer simulations, colloids in-
teracting via a hard-core and soft shoulder (HCSS) potentials were seen in this work to form spherical
clusters (or clumps) in the ﬂuid phase. At low temperature, clusters were observed to freeze into cluster
crystals, cluster glasses and a number of polycrystalline materials [37]. In a later study for the same po-
tential but in 2D, Norizoe and Kawakatsu [38, 39] also reported clusters that are string-like or extended
in shape. Extended, chain-like clusters were also observed by Camp [40] for a continuous repulsive po-
tential with a shoulder (different from that of HCSS); the shoulder was determined to be responsible for
the emergence of the clusters. In addition to clusters, HCSS are capable of forming a variety of other
ordered phases at low temperature. Malescio and Pellicane [41] reported a regular striped phase while
Glaser et al. [42] discovered cluster crystals and cluster ﬂuids in MC simulations. Cluster ﬂuids were also
reported by Mladek et al. [43], lanes by Fornleitner and Kahl [44], and lamella, hexagonal-columnar and
body-center cubic phases, as well as the associated inverse structures by Shin et al. [45]. Dotera et al. [46]
describe various quasicrystalline structures that are formed in 2D at low temperature.

It should be noted that many of the properties displayed by the cluster-forming colloids with repulsive
interactions actually do not require the presence of the hard core. Likos et al. [47] considered a number
of potentials bound at the origin, including the ﬂat portion of the HCSS lacking the hard core, and in-
troduced a criterion for determining if a system with such potential should experience a micro-phase
separation into a lattice state where multiple colloids occupy the same lattice site. This criterion was later
successfully tested in computer simulations [48], which indeed uncovered cluster crystals. Repulsive [3, 7]
as well as attractive [49] colloids were seen to form clusters in laboratory experiments.

In this work we demonstrate by computer simulations that potentials that do not belong to either of
the classes mentioned above are also capable of forming equilibrium clusters. Speciﬁcally, we consider
the potentials that, instead of the global minimum as in the SALR scheme, display a local minimum that
has a positive energy and is separated from the longer-distance, zero-energy states by a ﬁnite barrier.

13605-2

Equilibrium clusters

Unlike in the SALR scheme, however, potentials with local attractive minima and long-range repulsion
(LALR) lack the energy incentive for the particles to self-associate. LALR model shares with the HCSS
potential the global repulsive character and soft shoulder. Experimentally, such potentials may arise as
a result of incomplete cancellation between the attractive and repulsive terms. Theoretically, potentials
with local minima are little studied. Batten et al. [50] showed that such potentials have unique ground-
state conﬁgurations, including kagome and honeycomb crystals, and stripes. Liu et al. [51] also examined
ground-state conﬁgurations of a LALR system conﬁned to a plane. Neither of these papers focused on
clusters. To the best of our knowledge, this subject has never been studied.

A comparative analysis of clusters formed by systems of all three schemes, LALR, SALR and HCSS,
indicates that the LALR serves as a bridge between the other two. Like in the HCCS model, LALR po-
tentials induce entropy-driven expanded clusters but only at low overall system density and for small
cluster sizes. With an increase in the density, the LALR system, like its SALR counterpart, leads to energy
driven clusters of large size. The dual identity of the LALR model is also revealed in its temperature be-
havior. Small clusters of this system are stabilized by temperature, like in the HCSS, but larger clusters
are destabilized, in common with the SALR.

2. Methods

The shape of the model potential considered in this work is inspired by the inter-molecular potential
of aqueous solutions of lysozyme. Using structural functions available from scattering experiments for
this protein, effective potentials were derived in our prior work (data not published) for a number of
pH values. For pH 2, the potential was seen to possess a local minimum at short distances followed by
a repulsive term decaying to zero at longer distances. To reﬂect these features, the following analytical
function was considered:

The shape of the potential is determined by a set of six basic parameters, σH, σA , ǫw , ǫb , δǫ and κ. A hard-
core wall is placed at σH. The short-range (SA) part of the potential contains a minimum (either local or
global) located between σH and σA . The minimum is triangular in shape. Its energy is deﬁned by ǫw while
the depth is given by δǫ. The long-range part (LR), deﬁned by distances greater than σA is either missing
or given by the Yukawa potential characterized by the inverse decay length κ. The SA and LR parts meet at
r = σA where the energy is ǫb . The schematic of the model potential is shown in ﬁgure 1 together with its
experimental prototype. Depending on the choice of parameters, the potential may represent a number
of soft-matter systems. Throughout this article, we use σA as the unit of distance and ǫb as the unit of
energy. The hard-core diameter is set at σH = σA /3. The remaining three parameters are varied to achieve
the following ﬁve representative shapes: 1) Hard-core soft-shoulder (HCSS) potential studied extensively
previously in 2- and 3-D [38, 39, 41, 42, 52], 2) Hard-core long-range repulsion potential (HCLR), which,
to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied yet in this speciﬁc form, but similar potentials were
considered in the past [40, 53], 3) short-range attraction and long-range repulsion potential (SALR), which
was also studied extensively but in a different form [2, 53, 54] , 4) local attraction soft-shoulder (LASS)
potential, which has a minimum but no long-range tail and 5) local attractive minimum and long-range
repulsion (LALR) potential. The last two potentials are considered here for the ﬁrst time. The summary
of all the employed parameters is shown in table 1.

All systems were studied using the standard Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) method [55]. For a quick
scan in the phase space, simulation boxes with 216 particles were considered at 6 values of the total
density. The densities ranged from 0.17 to 1.69 in reduced units. A number of temperatures were inves-
tigated, depending on the needs of each system, as discussed in the main text. Temperature is reported

truncation distance rc = 2σA was used. Tests were performed with longer rc to make sure that the results
are not affected by this parameter. Additionally, simulations with larger boxes containing 5832 particles
were conducted for select thermodynamic points in order to extract cluster statistics. The maximum dis-
placement of particles in the MC moves was adjusted to achieve 30% success rate. All simulations were
run for more than 1×106 MC steps and tests were performed to make sure that the reported results are
converged.

To quantify the process of self-association, all the recorded conformations were clustered. The stan-
dard clustering algorithm was used which assigns a particle to the given cluster if its separation from any
particle in the cluster is less than a cut-off distance Rc. For the cut-off, the diameter of the soft-shoulder
σA was used.

In order to characterize the progress of clusterization, a ratio x of the number of particles in
monomeric state to the total number of particles was analyzed. Conﬁgurations saved in simulations were
used to construct a distribution P (x) as a function of density and other thermodynamic parameters. The
distribution function yields the free energy proﬁle ∆F (x) = −kBT log P (x), where kB is the Boltzmann
constant and T is the temperature, which has a minimum at the most likely value of x. Function ∆F (x)
measures the free energy difference between conformations with two different values of parameter x,
for instance 0 and 1, in which case it reports the full cost/beneﬁt of converting the system at the given
thermodynamic point into clusters. The free energy can be decomposed into internal energy and entropy
contributions using the standard thermodynamic relationship ∆F (x) = ∆U (x) − T ∆S(x). The unknown
functions ∆U (x) and −T ∆S(x) can be determined if the temperature dependence of ∆F (x) is available.

Equilibrium clusters

First, numerical differentiation of ∆F (x) can yield −T ∆S(x) (ignoring the entropy dependence on tem-
perature in the numerical algorithm) and then entropy and free energy can be combined to produce
internal energy. This method is commonly used in literature to monitor the progress of various biochem-
ical reactions (see for instance reference [56] and references therein). In the analysis of the free energy
proﬁles, the small size of the simulation box was not seen to affect the conclusions of the work.

ture. As an illustration, ﬁgure 2 (a) shows P (s), the ratio of particles engaged in clusters of size s to the
total number of particles in the simulation box observed for the HCSS model at a reduced temperature
T = 0.62. At low density ρ = 0.17 (shown in units of σ−3
A ), the majority of all particles are monomers. As
the density is increased, the proportion of monomers drops at the beneﬁt of dimers, trimers and other
multimers. At 0.34 < ρ < 0.6, the population of monomers drops below 0.5, at which point the system be-
comes dominated by clusters. Clusterization continues for higher densities, and at ρ = 1.01, the number
of monomers drops below the number of particles involved in dimers. At still higher densities, ρ > 1.35,
the system undergoes a percolation transition, above which only a single cluster encompassing the entire
simulation box survives. Figure 2 (b) shows P (s) recorded for different systems at the density just below
the percolation threshold. While all curves demonstrate a majority cluster population, two speciﬁc fea-
tures stand out. First, the SALR simulations show a strong preference for cluster size of ∼10 monomers.
All other systems populate a wide spectrum of sizes with only a small population maximum for dimers
and trimers. Second, in the limit of large s, the data of HCSS simulations demonstrate a clear power-law
dependence, P (s) ∼ 1/sn . The observed exponent of n = 1.2 is in excellent agreement with the prediction
of the random percolation limit [39] [note that the usual cluster-size distribution function n(s) is related
to the distribution function used here as n(s) = P (s)/s]. In all other systems, P (s) decays faster.

3.2. Cluster statistics critically depends on the type of the potential

All the studied systems populate the clusters that differ widely in size and shape. Radius of gyration
Rg(s) is used to characterize how the size of a cluster depends on the number of particles it contains.
The most interesting dependence is observed for the SALR potential. Figure 3 shows Rg(s) for this model
recorded for several values of the total density of the solution ρ. At low densities, the radius of gyration
is a monotonous function of the number of particles. Starting at ρ = 0.68, it begins to develop a plateau,

signaling the onset of a conﬁgurational change. At ρ = 1.01, Rg remains unchanged for 3 < s < 19 and
then jumps twofold for s > 23. It is easy to ﬁgure out what happens at the transition point by examining
the shape of the clusters. Representative clusters for s = 19, which is just before the transition, and s = 24,
which is immediately after it, are shown in ﬁgure 3 (a). The smaller, or primary, clusters form dense and
almost spherical clumps of particles. The larger clusters are made of two (or more) such clumps joined
together. Thus, cluster formation is driven by hierarchical supramolecular assembly: small clusters are
assembled at initial stages and later on serve as building blocks for larger clusters. This scenario explains
the sudden increase in Rg(s) at a certain transition value sc.

The unusual cluster statistics can be rationalized from the standpoint of equilibrium thermodynam-
ics. In common with other SALR potentials [53, 57], the ground-state (GS) conﬁguration of the current
model is a 1D Bernal spiral. The energy of the spiral is a monotonously decreasing function of s that con-
tinues to decline until all available monomers are absorbed onto the cluster. At zero and suﬃciently low
temperature, the spiral is the only observable conformation. At ﬁnite temperatures, however, this picture
changes dramatically. The entropy that is lost by the monomers during the assembly process becomes im-
portant. The lowest free energy is achieved through a combination of both internal energy and entropy.
The balance between energy and entropy contributions dictates the size of the primary cluster sc. The loss
of energy due to the fracturing of the ground state is compensated for by the gain in the entropy arising
from the translational freedom of the resulting clusters. As the density of the solution increases (volume
is lowered), the entropic gain decreases. So will do the associated loss of energy. As a consequence, the GS
conformation will break into a smaller number of pieces. This means that the size of the primary cluster
should go up with density. This is exactly what one sees in ﬁgure 3 (a) after comparing Rg(s) for ρ = 0.68
and 1.01.

The statistics of all other systems are similar to one another and can be described as those of a polydis-
perse mixture of clusters of different sizes and shapes. As in the case of SALR, the size of the clusters also
decreases with the increase of density but this effect is much less pronounced. No non-trivial behavior is
seen. A detailed comparison of Rg(s) obtained for different systems [considered at the same densities as
in ﬁgure 2 (b)] is presented in ﬁgure 3 (b). The plateau in the SALR curve is seen again. Moreover, it is
possible to discern the scaling statistics for large clusters. In that limit, the radius of gyration has a power-
law dependence Rg(s) ∼ sn with n = 0.46, which is independent of the density. This exponent is close to
n = 0.5 observed for ideal, or Gaussian, polymer chains which lack the excluded volume interactions.
The Gaussian model mechanism may be applied to the assembly of large colloidal clusters. Although the
primary clusters do have the excluded volume, they are allowed to inter-penetrate via the exchange of
particles. Thus, from the statistical point of view, they act as zero-size particles. For the same reason, SALR
clusters do not experience compression from the environment, as do HCSS clusters, and remain swollen
compared to maximally compact states.

The statistics of other systems in the large-cluster limit are governed by n = 0.33, which corresponds
to a maximally compact object. This observation is illustrated in ﬁgure 3 (b) for HCSS potential. For the

13605-6

Equilibrium clusters

same system in the limit of small s, the radius of gyration scales as Rg ∼ sm , where m = 1.13. Note that for
the linear arrangement of the smallest clusters, dimer and trimer, the exponent m = 1.2. Therefore, HCSS
behaves as a linear chain for small s. This is in agreement with the prior work on this system [39], which
also shows that the linear scaling persists to large clusters for a speciﬁc choice of potential parameters
(different from those of the present work). HCLR, LASS and LALR potentials also exhibit almost a linear
scaling but with the exponent that is system-speciﬁc. In common with the HCSS model, clusters formed
by these potentials experience a cross-over from a linear regime for small clusters to a collapsed chain for
large clusters. The transition is gradual and takes place over two orders of magnitude. This behavior is in
sharp contrast to the SALR model and can be explained by the speciﬁc character of the HCSS interaction.
Although the formation of clusters in this model is driven by entropy (see below), the speciﬁc shape of
different clusters of the same size is also inﬂuenced by energy. Since the interaction is purely repulsive,
particles within a cluster will choose to reside as far from their neighbors as possible. This results in
linear conformations for small clusters, which minimize the overlap between constituent particles. For
larger clusters, the minimal overlap can be achieved in string-like but bended conformations, similarly to
those observed in the self-avoiding polymers. Like in the polymers, colloidal clusters should experience
an entropic collapse with the pertinent exponent of the radius of gyration of m = 0.591, or approximately
3/5 as predicted by Flory [58]. The fact that the observed exponent 0.33 is lower indicates that large clus-
ters experience additional compression from the environment, which may only result from the repulsive
interactions of clusters with other species in the solution, both clusters and monomers alike. These the-
oretical arguments lead us to the conclusion that the speciﬁc details of the cross-over will depend on a)
the extent of the soft shoulder in the potential, which governs how much linear chains gain in energy
compared to the collapsed ones and b) the strength of the repulsive tail, which determines how strongly
various colloidal species repel each other, thus inducing cluster collapse.

4. Discussion

4.1. Two classes of cluster-forming systems use different assembly mechanisms

Our simulations clearly demonstrate that all of the studied systems form equilibrium clusters. In view
of this ﬁnding, the relevant question to ask is: ‘Why does that happen? What are the pertinent mecha-
nisms?’. Perhaps the simplest to explain is the mechanism of the SALR model. By design, this potential
favors association of particles by providing a negative potential energy to conﬁgurations with close sep-
aration among particles. Clusters of different topologies represent a ground-state conﬁguration of SALR
potentials [2, 57], including the one studied here. Thus, for these systems, cluster assembly is expected
to be driven by internal energy. To quantify this assessment, it makes sense to analyze the free energy
proﬁle of the clusterization reaction as a function of a certain order parameter. Since we are interested
in the transition into the cluster state in general, not into a speciﬁc type of cluster, it is most convenient
to monitor the number of particles in the monomeric state as a progress variable. To make a compari-
son between systems of different sizes easier, the number of monomers will be normalized by the total
number of particles, producing a ratio of monomers 0 < x < 1. Conformations with no clusters have x = 1
while those lacking monomers (complete transformation into clusters) are characterized by x = 0. Inter-
nal energy, ∆U (x), and entropy, −T ∆S(x), can be computed for each x (see ‘Methods’ section) to elucidate
the role of these functions in the cluster formation. Figure 4 (a) shows ∆U (x) and −T ∆S(x) obtained for
the SALR model at ρ = 0.68. As predicted above, the cluster formation is driven by energy and opposed
by entropy. The two curves combined yield a minimum of free energy at about x = 0.015.

The same analysis was repeated for the HCSS potential. Note that this model in 2D, given the appro-
priate choice of parameters, forms ordered conﬁgurations in the ground and low-energy states [59] as
well as quasi-crystals [46] . Thus, one may expect the remnants of ordered structures to survive at ﬁnite
temperature, giving rise to clusters stabilized by energy [42]. Figure 4 (b), depicting ∆U (x) and −T ∆S(x)
demonstrates that this expectation is not justiﬁed. Clusters are stabilized entirely by entropy and destabi-
lized by energy. The two systems, SALR and HCSS, differ dramatically in their cluster formation scenarios.
While clusters in SALR tend to stay intact due to the mutual attraction, clusters in the HCSS model use
a different mechanism. Namely, particles at distances σH < r < σA experience no force and move freely

about each other. Particles in the monomeric state experience no force either, since the potential is zero
for r > σA. Therefore, clusters stay together because the volume created by joining the soft-shoulder re-
gions of all constituent particles is greater than the volume available to them in the monomeric state (at a
distance r > σA from any other monomer or cluster). This point is illustrated in ﬁgure 5. For a monomeric
particle, the moment of joining an existing cluster is accompanied by an increase in energy as well as by
an increase in entropy. As long as the entropy wins, particles spend the majority of their time in cluster
conﬁgurations. Note that these clusters will have a very short residence time of the order of the duration
of binary collisions. They will also rapidly disintegrate in the event of an increase in the available volume.
Cluster formation in HCRL and LASS models is driven by the same mechanism as in the HCSS model.
Adding a repulsive tail to the potential, as in HCLR, changes the appearance of −T ∆S(x): at small x it

particle, denoted by black circle, has the choice of either to: a) remain monomeric, in which case it is
allowed to explore white-colored space, or b) join a cluster, in which case it is allowed to explore light-
gray space. Dark gray space indicates hard-core areas which are not accessible to the particle. Clusters
become stable when the volume of the light-gray area exceeds that of the white area.

begins to disfavor clusters, see ﬁgure 4 (d). However, the destabilizing effect of energy is unaffected. An
additional minimum in the soft shoulder, as in LASS, decreases the destabilizing effect of energy, compare
ﬁgure 4 (c) and (b), but not to the extent of reversing its role. Cluster formation of both systems is driven
by entropy.

4.2. The model with local minimum exhibits a dual identity

The model with the local minimum and repulsive tail stands out from the rest of the studied systems.
Figure 6 shows its energy and entropy evaluated at two different densities, ρ = 0.34 and ρ = 0.68. At a
lower density, the mechanism is as in the HCSS system with the entropy stabilizing the clusters. For a
higher density, the mechanism changes and becomes similar to that of the SALR potential, where the in-
ternal energy drives the assembly of clusters. The transformation is not complete as entropy still favors
the clusters at high density instead of disfavoring them, as in the SALR potential. Nevertheless, the re-
versal of the energy role is quite remarkable. This is not seen in any other potential and indicates that
the process of cluster formation in the systems interacting via potentials with local minima can be ex-
traordinarily complex. It takes the presence of both monomers and small clusters in such systems for the
clusterization to be driven by energy. Any theory that aims at predicting the cluster distribution quanti-
tatively should be capable of capturing that effect. That means a proper description of monomer/cluster
mixture, including the association/dissociation balance, across a wide range of densities. It is not clear
which of the currently available liquid-state theories would be capable of accomplishing this task.

Figure 6. The same as ﬁgure 4, but for the potential with local minimum and repulsive tail, LALR. Both
entropy- and energy driven mechanisms of cluster formation are present, depending on the total density
of the solution.

The split identity of the LALR model is also evident in its temperature behavior. Since the assembly of
clusters in the HCSS potential is entropic in nature, it should be enhanced by temperature. The opposite is
true for the SALR model, where clusters should become less stable at higher temperature. Figure 7, show-
ing the fraction of monomers as a function of temperature and density for different models, conﬁrms
this conjecture. Different symbols in this ﬁgure represent different systems, broken lines correspond to a
high temperature of 0.62 while solid lines stand for the low temperature of 0.21. For the HCSS model, the
population of monomers at the lower temperature is higher than the population at a higher temperature,
the solid line is above the broken line, at all densities, indicating that cluster formation is enhanced by
temperature. For the SALR model, the broken line is above the solid line, which is the evidence that tem-
perature hinders the formation of clusters. For the LALR potential, the broken line is above the solid line
for ρ < 0.68 and vice versa for higher densities. Thus, this model exhibits the features characteristic of
both classes of cluster-forming colloids. The entropy-driven mechanism dominates at low densities while
the energy-driven mechanism — at high densities.

5. Conclusions

There are two known types of cluster-forming colloids: a) those that interact via purely repulsive po-
tential with a soft shoulder and, possibly, a tail, and b) those that are characterized by a potential with
the global attractive well at short distances followed by a repulsive tail at long distances. By adding an
attractive term to the otherwise repulsive potential, it is easy to transform the potentials of the ﬁrst type
into the potentials of the second type. Thus, it may seem obvious that systems of the two types exhibit
similar properties, in particular the capability of forming clusters. However, there is one caveat with this
argument. Extrapolating properties of one system based on the results of another system makes sense
only if the two are suﬃciently similar so that perturbation theory can be used. This is clearly not the case
for the cluster-forming colloids. Repulsive and attractive potentials exhibit completely different struc-
tural, dynamic and phase behaviors. Take, for instance, the gas-liquid transition in attractive colloids that
is missing in the repulsive colloids. The differences also extend to the clusters of these systems. While
attractive potentials form compact clusters of speciﬁc size, the repulsive potentials lead to extended,
polydisperse multimers. There is only a limited amount of information that can be learned about one
system by extrapolating the properties of the other. Simulations remain the most reliable and accurate
tool in the studies of a new or unknown potential. Simulations played a key role in this work, helping us
to reveal that a repulsive potential with a local minimum shares certain properties with both other types
of cluster-forming potentials. The clusters it populates are similar to those of purely repulsive potentials,
while the energy-driven mechanism is similar to the attractive potentials.

Our results were obtained for a speciﬁc shape of the potential with a local minimum. How general
they are with respect to other systems remains to be seen. Of particular interest here would be to con-
sider square-well potentials which have been studied extensively in the literature in regard to phase
transitions. Also, of interest would be to examine the behavior of continuous potentials, like those that
can be constructed with the help of two Yukawa functions.

Рiвноважнi кластери в розчинах колоїдiв, що взаємодiють
через потенцiал з локальним мiнiмумом

В простих колоїдних розчинах кластерами називаються мультимери, що виникають внаслiдок асоцiацiї
мономерiв i спiвiснують з ними в динамiчнiй рiвновазi. Iснують два типи потенцiалiв, що ведуть до утво-
рення кластерiв: а) потенцiали з глобальним мiнiмумом, що можуть виникнути, зокрема, внаслiдок не-
повної компенсацiї притягальної взаємодiї на коротких вiдстанях та вiдштовхувальної взаємодiї на довгих
вiдстанях, б) повнiстю вiдштовхувальнi взаємодiї, якi демонструють м’яке “плече”. За допомогою комп’ю-
терних симуляцiй в данiй роботi показано, що потенцiали з локальним мiнiмумом i вiдштовхувальним
хвостом теж мають здатнiсть утворювати рiвноважнi кластери. Хоча вони не належать до жодного з пе-
релiчених вище класiв, аналiз показує, що такi потенцiали мають з ними певнi спiльнi характеристики.
При малiй густинi колоїдiв кластери, утворенi новими потенцiалами, видовженi подiбно до кластерiв в
суто вiдштовхувальних системах. При великiй густинi, новi кластери компактнi, як це спостерiгається в
системах з глобальним потенцiальним мiнiмумом. Отже, новi потенцiали слугують тим мiстком, який по-
єднує два вiдомi класи потенцiалiв, що ведуть до утворення кластерiв в колоїдних розчинах.
