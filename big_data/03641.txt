THE EQUIVALENCE OF WEAK AND VERY WEAK

SUPERSOLUTIONS TO THE POROUS MEDIUM EQUATION

PEKKA LEHTEL ¨A AND TEEMU LUKKARI

Abstract. We prove that various notions of supersolutions to the porous
medium equation are equivalent under suitable conditions. More spesiﬁ-
cally, we consider weak supersolutions, very weak supersolutions, and m-
superporous functions deﬁned via a comparison principle. The proofs are
based on comparison principles and a Schwarz type alternating method,
which are also interesting in their own right. Along the way, we show that
Perron solutions with merely continuous boundary values are continuous up
to the parabolic boundary of a suﬃciently smooth space-time cylinder.

1. Introduction

Our aim is to clarify and extend the connections between various notions of

solutions and supersolutions to the porous medium equation

(1.1)

ut − ∆um = 0 in ΩT = Ω × (0, T ).

We treat both the case of prescribed boundary values and the purely local
notions, and restrict our attention to the degenerate case m > 1. For the
basic theory of the equation and numerous further references, we refer to the
monographs [9], [19], [20] and [21].

There are at least two natural ways to deﬁne solutions to (1.1). Weak
solutions are deﬁned by multiplying the equation by a suitable test function
and integrating by parts once. In this deﬁnition, the function um is assumed
to be in a parabolic Sobolev space. In the case of the boundary value problem,
the boundary values are interpreted in a Sobolev sense. The chief attraction
of this notion is that a weak solution itself is an admissible test function after
a molliﬁcation in the time direction, which leads to natural energy estimates.
On the other hand, we may integrate by parts twice in the space variable,
thus relaxing the regularity assumptions for solutions. This leads to very weak
solutions, a notion which makes sense under the minimal assumptions that
u and um are integrable. The boundary values are taken into account via
including the appropriate integrals over the lateral boundary and at the initial
time. One of the advantages of the very weak solutions is their stability under

convergence. Weak and very weak solutions with ﬁxed boundary values turn
out to be the same. This result is probably known to experts, at least when
the boundary values are suﬃciently regular.

It is important to understand not only the solutions, but also supersolutions.
Supersolutions arise naturally in obstacle problems [2, 4] and problems with
measure data [3, 18]. Furthermore, supersolutions connect the equation to
potential theory, providing important tools such as the Perron method [13].
In the classical theory they also play a central role in the study of boundary
regularity, removability of sets and other ﬁne properties.

There are again various ways to deﬁne supersolutions. Weak and very weak

supersolutions (Deﬁnition 4.1 and Deﬁnition 4.2) satisfy the inequality

∂u
∂t

− ∆um ≥ 0,

the rigorous interpretation being analoguous to the concepts of weak and very
weak solutions. Another way is to use a comparison principle: supersolutions
are lower semicontinuous functions which satisfy a parabolic comparison prin-
ciple with respect to continuous weak solutions. We call these supersolutions
m-superporous functions (Deﬁnition 5.1). This is one of the ways to deﬁne
superharmonic functions in classical potential theory, and it is amenable to
generalization to nonlinear equations. In the case of the PME, the basic prop-
erties of this class of supersolutions have been established in [11]; see also
[12]. Several nice properties follow immetedially from the deﬁnition of m-
superporous functions. For instance, it is easy to see that the minimum of two
m-superporous functions is also m-superporous. Moreover, the m-superporous
functions form a closed class under increasing convergence.

A natural question is whether the diﬀerent classes of supersolutions are
equivalent. The similar problem is well understood in the case of p-Laplace
type equations, see [14, 17]. However, the question is more challenging for
the porous medium equation. For example, the boundary values cannot be
perturbed in the standard way, because constants cannot be added to solutions.
Further diﬃculties arise when trying to incorporate the very weak notions to
the arguments. Therefore new methods have to be developed.

Our main result is the equivalence of the above classes of supersolutions

under suitable conditions:

Theorem 1.1. The following properties are equivalent for continuous, non-
negative functions u.

(1) u is a weak supersolution,
(2) u is a very weak supersolution,
(3) u is m-superporous.

For completeness we also address the question of equivalence of the classes of
solutions, as it is diﬃcult to ﬁnd a reference where this matter is treated thor-
oughly. Along the way, we obtain that Perron solutions with merely continuous

THE EQUIVALENCE OF SUPERSOLUTIONS

boundary values are continuous up to the parabolic boundary of a suﬃciently
smooth space-time cylinder, thus complementing the results of [13].

The natural situation for Theorem 1.1 would be to consider locally bounded
lower semicontinuous functions.
Indeed, lower semicontinuity is the natural
regularity of weak supersolutions, see [1], and local boundedness is deﬁnitely
necessary. Further, the equivalence of weak supersolutions and m-superporous
functions under these weaker assumptions has been established in [11]. Our
contribution is including very weak supersolutions to the theory. The necessity
of boundedness can be seen by considering the Barenblatt solution

Bm(x, t) =


where

t−λ(cid:16)C − λ(m−1)

t2λ/n(cid:17)1/(m−1)

,

t > 0,

t ≤ 0,

λ =

n(m − 1) + 2

.

The Barenblatt solution Bm is an unbounded m-superporous function, but its
gradient fails to be square integrable in any neighbourhood of the origin, and
thus Bm is not a weak supersolution.

It is unclear whether the classes are the same, if one only assumes lower
semicontinuity. The crucial point where continuity is used is to show that very
weak supersolutions are also very weak supersolutions with boundary values
given by the function itself. This is needed for proving the comparison principle
for very weak supersolutions. Further, there are other challenges already in the
continuous case. Therefore we ﬁnd the continuity assumption reasonable. Note
that equivalence holds for solutions without assuming continuity: nonnegative
very weak solutions turn out to be continuous after a redeﬁnition on a set of
zero measure, by [8].

Yet another way to deﬁne supersolutions is viscosity supersolutions, see [5,
6]. This notion uses pointwise touching test functions. In this paper we focus
on the previously mentioned classes of supersolutions. A very interesting open
question is whether viscosity supersolutions are equivalent to the other notions
of supersolutions as well. The answer is known to aﬃrmative for equations
similar to the p-Laplacian by [10], so one would expect the same result to hold
for the PME as well.

2. Weak solutions

Throughout the work we use the following notation. We work in space-time
cylinders ΩT = Ω × (0, T ) ⊂ Rn+1, where Ω ⊂ Rn is a bounded domain, such
that ∂Ω is suﬃciently nice, for example smooth or Lipschitz. We denote the
lateral boundary of ΩT by ΣT = ∂Ω × [0, T ] and the parabolic boundary by
∂pΩT = Ω×{0}∪ΣT . For U ⋐ Ω, we denote Ut1,t2 = U ×(t1, t2). The parabolic
boundary of Ut1,t2 is deﬁned as ∂pUt1,t2 = U × {t1} ∪ ∂U × [t1, t2].

We consider the solutions to the boundary value problem

(2.1)

ut − ∆um = 0 on ΩT ,
u(x, 0) = u0(x),
um = g
on ΣT ,




where u0 is in H 1(Ω) and g is a continuous function deﬁned in ΩT such that
g ∈ L2(0, T ; H 1(Ω)). Further, we require that the initial and lateral boundary
values are compatible in the sense that the function ϕ : ∂pΩT → R deﬁned by

ϕ(x, t) =(g(x, t)1/m,

u0(x),

(x, t) ∈ ΣT ,
(x, t) ∈ Ω × {0}

is continuous. For simplicity, we will assume that g and u0 are non-negative
and thus the solutions will be non-negative as well by the comparison principle,
which will be proved in section 3. Hence we may assume that the solutions
are always non-negative.

Deﬁnition 2.1. We say u is a local weak solution to (1.1) if um ∈ L2
and u satisﬁes the equality

loc(0, T ; H 1

loc(Ω))

(−uϕt + ∇um · ∇ϕ) dx dt = 0

ZΩT

for any ϕ ∈ C ∞

0 (ΩT ).

A function u is a weak solution to the boundary value problem (2.1), if

um ∈ L2(0, T ; H 1(Ω)), um − g ∈ L2(0, T ; H 1

0 (Ω)), and

ZΩT

(−uϕt + ∇um · ∇ϕ) dx dt =ZΩ

u0(x)ϕ(x, 0) dx

for all smooth test functions ϕ with compact support in space, vanishing at
the time t = T .

We will show that the boundary value problem (2.1) has at most one weak

solution. This follows by using a clever test function devised by Ole˘ınik.

Lemma 2.2. Weak solutions to the boundary value problem (2.1) are unique.

Proof. The proof is a standard application of the Ole˘ınik test function

ϕ =(R T

0 otherwise.

if 0 ≤ t < T,

For a detailed proof, we refer to [19, Theorem 5.3].

3. Very weak solutions

In this section we consider another natural class of generalized solutions,

very weak solutions. This concept is deﬁned as follows.

THE EQUIVALENCE OF SUPERSOLUTIONS

Deﬁnition 3.1. We say u ∈ L1
um ∈ L1

loc(ΩT ) and u satisﬁes the equality

loc(ΩT ) is a local very weak solution to (1.1) if

(um∆η + uηt) dx dt = 0

ZΩT

for any η ∈ C ∞

0 (ΩT ).

A function u ∈ L1(ΩT ) is a very weak solution to the boundary value problem

(2.1), if um ∈ L1(ΩT ) and

ZΩT

(um∆η + uηt) dx dt +ZΩ

u0(x)η(x, 0) dx =ZΣT

g∂νη dS dt

for all smooth η vanishing on ΣT and at time t = T . Note that the test
functions η are not required to have compact support in ΩT .

We prove the comparison principle for the very weak solutions to the bound-
ary value problem (2.1). That is, if u and v are very weak solutions to (2.1)
such that u ≥ v on ∂pΩT and um, vm ∈ L2(ΩT ), then u ≥ v in ΩT . In fact,
we only need to assume u is a very weak supersolution and v is a very weak
subsolution, see Lemma 4.4. First, we present a technical lemma, which will
be used in proving the comparison principles for very weak solutions and very
weak supersolutions. The idea is, that in both cases the proof can be reduced
to using the following lemma.

Lemma 3.2. Let u, v ∈ L2(ΩT ) and suppose um, vm ∈ L2(ΩT ). If

ZΩT (cid:0)(vm − um)∆ϕ + (v − u)ϕt(cid:1) dx dt ≥ 0

for every smooth ϕ vanishing on ΣT , then u ≥ v in ΩT .

The proof of this lemma can be found in [19, Theorem 6.5]. Next, we will
show that the comparison principle for very weak solutions follows from this
lemma.

Lemma 3.3. Let u, v ∈ L2(ΩT ) be very weak solutions to the boundary value
problem (2.1) with boundary and initial data g, u0 and h, v0 respectively. Sup-
pose that um, vm ∈ L2(ΩT ). If u0 ≥ v0 in Ω and g ≥ h on ΣT , then u ≥ v in
ΩT .

Proof. By the deﬁnition of very weak solutions,

Now suppose ϕ ≥ 0 in ΩT . Since u0 ≥ v0 on Ω, we see that

(v0 − u0)ϕ dx ≤ 0.

ZΩ

The function ϕ vanishes on the lateral boundary ΣT , so ∂νϕ ≤ 0, and since
g ≥ h on ΣT , we have

(h − g)∂νϕ dS dt ≥ 0.

ZΣT

Using the estimates above, we conclude

ZΩT (cid:0)(vm − um)∆ϕ + (v − u)ϕt(cid:1) dx dt ≥ 0.

Now we may apply Lemma 3.2 to conclude the proof.

using Lemma 3.3.

We use the following lemma from [13] to bypass the fact that we may not add
constants to solutions. We will present the proof for the reader’s convenience.

Lemma 3.5. Suppose g is a continuous, non-negative function in ΩT , such
that g ∈ L2(0, T ; H 1(Ω)) and suppose u0 ∈ H 1(Ω) is non-negative. Let ε ∈
(0, 1). Denote by gε = g + ε and u0,ε = u0 + ε. Let u and uε be a weak solutions
to (2.1) with boundary and initial data g, u0 and gε, u0,ε respectively. Then

(uε − u)(um

ε − um) dx dt ≤ ε|ΩT |(M + 1) + ε|ΩT |(M + 1)m,

ZΩT

where M = max{supΩT g, supΩ u0}.
Proof. Since u and uε are weak solutions, the equalities

ZΩT (cid:0) − uϕt + ∇um · ∇ϕ(cid:1) dx dt =ZΩ
ZΩT (cid:0) − uεϕt + ∇um

For proving the equivalence of local weak and very weak supersolutions,
we need to consider solutions to the boundary value problem (2.1) when the
functions u0 and g are only assumed to be continuous.
In such a case, the
previous interpretation of the boundary and initial conditions is no longer
available, so we use the notion of Perron solutions [13] instead. Perron solutions
are weak solutions in the interior, but the question whether they attain the
correct boundary values was left open in [13]. Next we show that this is
indeed the case in suﬃciently smooth cylinders, by using a barrier argument.
This justiﬁes calling the Perron solution the solution to the boundary value
problem (2.1).

In order to construct a suitable lower barrier, we need to show the existence
of signed solutions to the boundary value problem with smooth boundary
values. This will be done in the next lemma. The proof follows the ideas
outlined in Chapter 5 of [19].

Lemma 3.6. Let ΩT = Ω × (0, T ), where Ω ⊂ Rn is a bounded domain. Let
g be a smooth function deﬁned in a neighbourhood of ΣT and let u0 ∈ C ∞(Ω).
Then there exists a weak solution to the boundary value problem

ut − ∆(|u|m−1u) = 0 on ΩT ,
u(x, 0) = u0(x),
um = g
on ΣT ,




Proof. Let φ(s) = |s|m−1s. Deﬁne a smooth function φ1 such that

φ1(s) =(φ(s)

cs

for |s| ≥ 1,
for |s| ≤ 1
2,

φ1 is convex for s ≥ 0 and φ1(−s) = −φ1(s). Now deﬁne φn(s) = n−mφ1(ns),
where n = 1, 2, . . .. Then φn(s) = φ(s) for |s| ≥ 1
n(s) > 0 for every s ∈
R. Moreover φn → φ uniformly on compact sets. We consider the approximate
problem

n and φ′

(3.3)

ut − ∆φn(u) = 0 on ΩT ,
u(x, 0) = u0(x),
φ(u) = g

on ΣT .




By the quasilinear regularity theory (see [15]), there exists a smooth solution
un to (3.3). Moreover, by the maximum principle we have

−N ≤ un(x, t) ≤ M in ΩT ,

where N = max{sup(−u0), sup(−g)} and M = max{sup(u0), sup(g)}. We
multiply the equation (un)t − ∆φn(un) = 0 by a test function φn(un) − g ∈
L2(0, T ; H 1

0 (Ω)) and integrate by parts to get

ZΩT

(un)t(φn(un) − g) dx dt +ZΩT

Thus ∇φn(un) is uniformly bounded in L2(ΩT ). In order to control the time
derivative (φn(un))t, we multiply the equation (un)t − ∆φn(un) = 0 by the test
function ζ(t)(φn(un) − g)t, where ζ(t) is a smooth cut-oﬀ function, such that
0 ≤ ζ ≤ 1, ζ(t) = 1 for t ∈ (ε, T − ε), and ζ(0) = ζ(T ) = 0. Integrating by

Since un is bounded, φ′

n(un) ≤ C for some C. Thus by (3.7), we get

Hence, φn(un)t is uniformly bounded in L2(Ω × (ε, T − ε)).
In conclusion,
φn(un) is uniformly bounded in H 1(Ω × (ε, T − ε)). By compactness, there
exists a subsequence φnj (unj ) → w ∈ L2(Ω × (ε, T − ε)) almost everywhere. It
follows that w ∈ L2((0, T ), H 1(Ω)). The sequence unj is uniformly bounded,
so it converges to some u almost everywhere (taking a subsequence, if neces-
sary) and φnj (unj ) → φ(u) almost everywhere. Therefore w = φ(u) almost
everywhere. Since un is a classical solution to (3.3), it satisﬁes

By weak compactness, ∇φn(un) → ∇φ(u) weakly, thus showing that indeed u
is a weak solution to the problem.
(cid:3)

We are now ready to show that Perron solutions attain the correct boundary

values in the classical sense.

Lemma 3.7. Let the functions g ∈ C(ΩT ) and u0 ∈ C(Ω) be non-negative
and compatible. Then the Perron solution to the boundary value problem (2.1)
attains the correct boundary values continuously.

Proof. We will show the claim by a barrier type argument. To simplify notation
we write

ϕ(x, t) =(g(x, t)1/m,

u0(x),

(x, t) ∈ ΣT ,
(x, t) ∈ Ω × {0}.

Fix ξ ∈ ∂pΩT and take ε > 0. We will show that there exists a supersolution
v+ ∈ Uϕ, such that limz→ξ v+(z) = ϕ(ξ) + ε and a subsolution v− ∈ Lϕ, such
that limz→ξ v−(z) = ϕ(ξ) − ε. Here Uϕ and Lϕ denote the upper and lower
Perron classes respectively.

The upper barrier v+ can be constructed by solving the boundary value
problem (2.1) with boundary values ϕ + ε. A continuous solution exists by the
quasilinear theory, as described in the proof of the previous lemma. Moreover
v+ is continuous up to the boundary by [22]. In order to construct the lower
barrier v−, we will consider a small neighbourhood E of ξ. Let f be a smooth
function, such that f (ξ) = ϕ(ξ) − ε and f = −k on ∂p(E ∩ ΩT ) outside a
neighbourhood of ξ. By Lemma 3.6, there exists a weak solution ˜v in E ∩ ΩT
with boundary values f . We extend ˜v to the whole ΩT by deﬁning

v− =(max{˜v, −k} in E ∩ ΩT ,

in ΩT \ E.

−k

By choosing k large enough, we have v− ∈ Lϕ and v− = ˜v in E ∩ ΩT . Again,
the continuity of v− up to the boundary is provided by [22].

By the deﬁnition of the Perron solution, v− ≤ u ≤ v+ and thus

u(z) ≤ lim sup

u(z) ≤ ϕ(ξ) + ε.

Since this holds for every ε > 0, we conclude that limz→ξ u(z) = ϕ(ξ).

We are now ready to prove the ﬁrst of the main results, the equivalence of the
diﬀerent notions of solutions to the boundary value problem. We emphasize the
fact that the boundary and initial values are only assumed to be continuous.

Theorem 3.8. Let u be the Perron solution and v a very weak solution to the
boundary value problem

on ΩT ,

ut − ∆um = 0
u(x, 0) = u0(x),
um = g
on ΣT ,

with continuous, compatible boundary values u0 and g. If vm ∈ L2(ΩT ), then
u = v.

Proof. The claim follows from the comparison principle for very weak solutions
(Lemma 3.3) as soon as we show that the Perron solution u is also a very weak
solution to the boundary value problem. For smooth boundary values, this
follows by Green’s formula from the fact that the Perron solution also attains
the correct boundary values in the Sobolev sense, see Theorem 5.8 in [13].

It remains to reduce the general case to the smooth case. We do this by an

approximation argument. Deﬁne as before

ϕ(x, t) =(g(x, t)1/m,

u0(x),

(x, t) ∈ ΣT ,
(x, t) ∈ Ω × {0},

extend ϕ continuously to the whole space and choose smooth functions ϕj
converging to ϕ uniformly and such that

ϕj ≤ ϕ ≤ ϕj + 1/j.

Further, let uj and vj be the Perron solutions with boundary values ϕj and
ϕj + 1/j, respectively. Since uj ≤ u and

u − uj ≤ vj − uj → 0

as j → ∞ by Lemma 3.5, we have that uj → u pointwise in ΩT . Now uj
is a very weak solution to the boundary value problem with boundary values
given by ϕj, and passing to the limit j → ∞ in the very weak formulation for
uj shows that u is a very weak solution to the boundary value problem with
boundary values given by ϕ.
(cid:3)

The previous theorem together with the continuity result in [8] implies the

equivalence of local weak and very weak solutions.

Corollary 3.9. A nonnegative function u is a local very weak solution to the
PME if and only if u is a local weak solution to the PME.

Proof. By [8], local very weak solutions are continuous in the interior of ΩT .
Thus, following the proof of Lemma 4.3 below, we may show that local very
weak solutions are solutions to the boundary value problem (2.1) in space-time
cylinders Bt1,t2
⋐ ΩT where the base is a ball, with boundary values deﬁned
by the function itself. Therefore the result follows from Theorem 3.8 and the
fact that being a weak solution is a local property.
(cid:3)

4. Supersolutions

In this section, we turn our attention to supersolutions. The deﬁnitions of
weak supersolutions and very weak supersolutions are analogous to those of
weak solutions and very weak solutions.

THE EQUIVALENCE OF SUPERSOLUTIONS

Deﬁnition 4.1. A function u ∈ L2

loc(0, T ; H 1
loc(Ω))

loc(Ω)) is a (local) weak superso-

ZΩT (cid:0) − uϕt + ∇um · ∇ϕ(cid:1) dx dt ≥ 0

for all non-negative, compactly supported smooth test functions ϕ.

As in the case of weak solutions, it is natural to consider also very weak

supersolutions.

Deﬁnition 4.2. A function u ∈ L1
to (1.1), if um ∈ L1

loc(ΩT ) and

loc(ΩT ) is a (local) very weak supersolution

ZΩT (cid:0) − uϕt − um∆ϕ(cid:1) dx dt ≥ 0

for all non-negative, compactly supported smooth test functions ϕ.

As the ﬁrst step in relating the various classes of supersolutions we will
show that continuous very weak supersolutions can be seen as supersolutions
to the boundary value problem in a space-time cylinder, whose base is a ball,
with boundary values deﬁned by the function itself. The known argument for
solutions (see e.g. [9]) carries over to supersolutions without serious diﬃculties.
However, the continuity assumption is essential in the proof.

Lemma 4.3. Let u be a non-negative, continuous very weak supersolution
in ΩT . Then for any Br × (t1, t2) ⋐ ΩT , u is a very weak supersolution in

Br × (t1, t2) with boundary values u(cid:12)(cid:12)∂pBr×(t1,t2)

.

Proof. Let η be a smooth function in Br × (t1, t2) vanishing on ∂Br × (t1, t2).
For ε ∈ (0, r) and θ ∈ [0, ε) let Ψεθ be the radial, continuous function satisfying

Ψεθ(ρ) =(1 for 0 ≤ ρ ≤ r − ε,

0 for ρ ≥ r − θ,

and

∆Ψεθ(x) =

From now on, we will assume that n > 2 for simplicity. A similar reasoning
can be carried out also in the cases n = 1, 2. We observe that

The next step is to show that continuous very weak supersolutions satisfy
the comparison principle with continuous very weak solutions in the special
case where we look at a cylinder whose base is a ball. Since weak solutions
are also very weak solutions, this lemma is the key to showing that continuous
very weak supersolutions are indeed m-superporous functions in the sense of
Deﬁnition 5.1 below.

Lemma 4.4. Let u be a continuous very weak supersolution and let v be a
continuous very weak solution in ΩT . Let Ut1,t2 = Br × [t1, t2] ⋐ ΩT . Then if
u ≥ v on ∂pUt1,t2, then u ≥ v in Ut1,t2.

Proof. Since u is a continuous very weak supersolution, Lemma 4.3 gives

In fact, we could have assumed v is only a very weak subsolution to get the
same inequality. Now we are at similar situation as in (3.1) with inequality
instead of equality. However, the same reasoning still applies, and thus we
may use Lemma 3.2 to conclude that u ≥ v in Ut1,t2. Note that u and v are
continuous functions and thus u, v, um, vm ∈ L2(Ut1,t2) so the assumptions of
Lemma 3.3 hold for u and v.
(cid:3)

THE EQUIVALENCE OF SUPERSOLUTIONS

17

The following lemma extends the comparison property to ﬁnite unions of
space-time cylinders whose bases are balls. We utilize a Schwarz type alter-
nating method. The proof is delicate since we need to work around the fact
that constants cannot be added to solutions.

Lemma 4.5. Let Bi ⊂ Rn, i = 1, . . . , N be a collection of balls and let Ui =
Bi ×(t1, t2). Set K = ∪N
i=1Ui. Suppose that u satisﬁes the comparison principle
for cylinders whose base is a ball in a neighbourhood of K. That is, if h is a
continuous weak solution such that h ≤ u on ∂pU , where U is a cylinder whose
base is a ball, then h ≤ u in U .

Then the comparison principle for u holds also in K. That is, if h is a
solution of the PME in K, which is continuous up to the boundary of K, then
h ≤ u on ∂pK implies h ≤ u in K.

Proof. Let δ > 0. Take ϕ ∈ C ∞(K) ∩ C(K) such that

ϕ ≤ u in K ∪ ∂pK,

h − δ ≤ ϕ on ∂pK.

Let Ψ0 be a continuous weak subsolution to the PME in K satisfying

Ψ0 = ϕ on ∂pK,
Ψ0 ≤ ϕ in K.

Such a subsolution can be constructed by the arguments leading to Theorem
2.6 of [4]. We want to construct an increasing sequence of continuous weak
subsolutions vk such that vk → w, where w is a continuous weak solution. Set
v0 = Ψ0. For 1 ≤ i ≤ N and j ≥ 0 we deﬁne the functions recursively by

vN j+i =(˜vN j+i−1

vN j+i−1

in Ui,
in K \ Ui,

where ˜vN j+i−1 is the continuous weak solution in Ui with boundary values
vN j+i−1 on ∂pUi. Existence and continuity of ˜vN j+i−1 are provided by [13].
Thus vk is a continuous weak subsolution for each k.

We want to show that the sequence vk converges to a continuous weak so-
lution. Since vN j+i−1 is a continuous weak subsolution in Ui and vN j+i is a
continuous weak solution in Ui, we may use the comparison principle for sub-
solutions in Ui. By construction, vN j+i−1 and vN j+i coincide on ∂pUi and thus
vN j+i−1 ≤ vN j+i in Ui. Hence vk is an increasing sequence.

The function v0 has been chosen in such a way, that v0 ≤ ϕ ≤ u in K.
Suppose vN j+i−1 ≤ u in K. Now vN j+i ≤ u on ∂pUi by construction and
therefore since u satisﬁes the comparison principle in U by assumption, vN j+i ≤
u in Ui. It follows by induction, that vk ≤ u in K for all k. Now vk is bounded
and increasing and thus vk → w ≤ u for some w in K.

Weak solutions are locally H¨older continuous (see [7]), so for each z ∈ K,
there are iz ∈ N and rz > 0 such that B(z, rz) ⊂ Uiz and vN j+iz is H¨older
continuous in B(z, rz) for every j. Therefore the subsequence vN j+iz converges

18

LEHTEL ¨A AND LUKKARI

to a continuous function in B(z, rz). Since vk → w, we conclude that w is
continuous in K. To show the continuity of w up to the boundary, let hϕ
be the continuous weak solution in K, with boundary values ϕ on ∂pK. By
construction v0 ≤ w and by the comparison principle w ≤ hϕ in K ∪∂pK. Since
v0 = hϕ on ∂pK and v0, hϕ are continuous, we conclude that w is continuous
in K ∪ ∂pK.

Finally, we need to show that w is indeed a continuous weak solution in K.
It suﬃces to show that w is a continuous weak solution in U ρ
i = Bi0 ×(t1, t2 −ρ)
for every 1 ≤ i0 ≤ N and ρ > 0. The sequence vk is increasing, each vk is
continuous in K and w is continuous in K ∪ ∂pK. Therefore vk → w uniformly
in K ∩ {t ≤ t2 − ρ}. Thus for every ε > 0 there is jε such that for j ≥ jε, we
have

|w − vN j+i0| < ε
Let w′ be a continuous weak solution in U ρ
Now

in U ρ
i0.

i0 with boundary values w on ∂pU ρ
i0.

vN j+i0 ≤ w′ + ε,

and w′ ≤ vN j+i0 + ε on ∂pU ρ
i0.

Let wε be the continuous weak solution in U ρ
i0 and let vε be the continuous weak solution in U ρ

i0 with boundary values w′+ε on
i0 with boundary values
i0. Then by the comparison principle for weak solutions

∂pU ρ
vN j+i0 + ε on ∂pU ρ
vN j+i0 ≤ wε and w′ ≤ vε in U ρ

i0. Since

|w′ − vN j+i0| = (w′ − vN j+i0)+ + (vN j+i0 − w′)+

≤ (wε − vN j+i0) + (vε − w′),

we may use Lemma 3.5 to conclude |vN j+i0 − w′| → 0 uniformly in U ρ
to a subsequence, if necessary). Therefore we may assume

i0 (passing

vN j+i0 − ε ≤ w′ ≤ vN j+i0 + ε

in U ρ
i0.

Now

|w − w′| ≤ |w − vN j+i0| + |vN j+i0 − w′| < 2ε

in U ρ
i0.

Letting ε → 0 shows that w′ = w and thus w is a continuous weak solution
in U ρ
i0. Denote by wδ the continuous weak solution in K with boundary values
ϕ + δ on ∂pK. Then wδ ≥ h on ∂pK and thus by comparison principle for the
continuous weak solutions, the inequality holds in K. Therefore
δ − wm).

0 ≤ (h − w)+(hm − wm)+ ≤ (wδ − w)(wm

Lemma 3.5 gives us

0 ≤ZK

(h − w)+(hm − wm)+ dx dt ≤ZK

(wδ − w)(wm

δ − wm) dx dt

≤ δ|K|(sup ϕ + 1) + δ|K|(sup ϕ + 1)m.

Since this holds for any δ > 0, letting δ → 0 shows that h ≤ w in K. On the
other hand, w ≤ u by construction and thus h ≤ u as we wanted.
(cid:3)

THE EQUIVALENCE OF SUPERSOLUTIONS

5. m-superporous functions

Another important class of supersolutions is the class of m-superporous func-
tions, deﬁned in terms of a comparison principle with respect to continuous
weak solutions. This class is analoguous to superharmonic functions in classical
potential theory, where the deﬁnition is due to Riesz.

Deﬁnition 5.1. A function u : ΩT → [0, ∞] is m-superporous, if

(1) u is lower semicontinuous,
(2) u is ﬁnite in a dense subset of ΩT , and
(3) the following parabolic comparison principle holds: Let Ut1,t2

⋐ ΩT ,
and let h be a weak solution to the PME which is continuous in Ut1,t2.
Then, if h ≤ u on ∂pUt1,t2, h ≤ u also in Ut1,t2.

Our aim in this section is to is to connect m-superporous functions to the
notions of weak and very weak supersolutions, i.e. to prove Theorem 1.1. The
ﬁrst step is the next lemma, which shows that continuous very weak supersolu-
tions are m-superporous. This is essentially a consequence of Lemma 4.5, but
some care is again required due to the fact that constants may not be added
to solutions.

Lemma 5.2. Let u be a continuous very weak supersolution to (1.1) in ΩT .
Then u is m-superporous.

Proof. Let Ut1,t2
⋐ ΩT and let h be a continuous weak solution such that h ≤ u
on ∂pUt1,t2. We want to show, that h ≤ u in Ut1,t2. Take ε > 0 and deﬁne the
set

D = {(x, t) ∈ Ut1,t2 : h ≥ u + ε}.

Now D is compact and by the assumption D ⊂ U × [t1, t2]. Thus D has a
ﬁnite covering

K = ∪N

i=1Bi × [t1, t2],

where Bi are balls, such that Bi ⊂ U. Since D ⊂ K, we have ∂pK ⊂ Ut1,t2 \ D
and therefore h < u + ε on ∂pK. Let uε be the continuous weak solution with
boundary values u + ε on ∂pK. Then by the comparison principle h ≤ uεin K.
By Lemma 4.4 and Lemma 4.5, u satisﬁes the comparison principle in K and
thus u ≤ uε in K. Now

0 ≤ (h − u)+(hm − um)+ ≤ (uε − u)(um

ε − um)

and so by Lemma 3.5

0 ≤ZK

(h − u)+(hm − um)+ dx dt ≤ZK

(uε − u)(um

ε − um) dx dt

≤ ε|K|(sup u + 1) + ε|K|(sup u + 1)m.

By construction of the set D, we have h ≤ u + ε in Ut1,t2 \ D. Thus letting
ε → 0 shows that h ≤ u in Ut1,t2. We conclude that u is m-superporous in
ΩT .
(cid:3)

20

LEHTEL ¨A AND LUKKARI

The other nontrivial fact needed for Theorem 1.1 is that locally bounded
m-superporous functions are weak supersolutions. For this purpose, we next
present a Caccioppoli type estimate for the weak supersolutions.

Lemma 5.3. Let um ∈ L2(0, T ; H 1(Ω)) be a weak supersolution, such that
u ≤ M in ΩT for some M > 0. Then

ZΩT

ζ 2|∇um|2 dx dt ≤ 16M 2mT ZΩ

|∇ζ|2 dx + 4M m+1ZΩ

ζ 2 dx,

for every non-negative ζ ∈ C ∞

0 (Ω). Note that ζ depends only on x.

Proof. Formally, we use the test function ϕ = (M m − um)ζ 2 in the deﬁnition of
weak supersolutions. However, since no regularity for u is assumed in the time
variable, we need to use a time-regularized inequality to avoid the appearance
of the possibly nonexistent quantity ut. The proof is then just a straightforward
computation. For the details, we refer to [11, Lemma 2.15].
(cid:3)

The next step is to show that locally bounded m-superporous functions are
weak supersolutions. The idea of the proof is from [16]: one approximates a
given m-superporous function pointwise by solutions to the obstacle problem.
The approximants are weak supersolutions, so the claim then follows from the
Caccioppoli estimate. For the PME, this argument has been carried out in
[11].

Lemma 5.4. Let u be a locally bounded m-superporous function in ΩT . Then
u is a weak supersolution in ΩT .

Proof. We give the main points of the argument, referring to the proof of
Theorem 3.2 in [11] for the full details. Since u is lower semicontinuous, there
exists a sequence of functions ψk ∈ C ∞(ΩT ), such that

ψi < ψi+1

for every i,

and limk→∞ ψk(x, t) = u(x, t) for every (x, t) ∈ ΩT . Without loss of generality,
we may consider a set Qt1,t2
⋐ ΩT . For each k, let uk be the solution to the
obstacle problem with obstacle function ψk. By Theorem 2.6 in [4], a solution
uk exist, such that

uk = ψk on ∂pQt1,t2,
uk ≥ ψk in Qt1,t2 and
um
k ∈ L2(t1, t2; H 1(Q)).

Moreover, uk is a continuous weak supersolution in Qt1,t2, and a weak solution
in the open set {uk > ψk}. The latter fact and the comparison principle of
Remark 3.4 imply that

u1 ≤ u2 ≤ . . .
and
uk ≤ u for every k.

THE EQUIVALENCE OF SUPERSOLUTIONS

21

Now we have uk → u due to the inequalities

ψk ≤ uk ≤ u;

recall that limk→∞ ψk(x, t) = u(x, t).

Finally, the fact that u is indeed a weak supersolution to the porous medium
equation follows from the Caccioppoli estimate (Lemma 5.3) and weak com-
pactness.
(cid:3)

We now have everything we need to prove the second main result.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let u be a continuous weak supersolution in ΩT . By
the deﬁnition of weak derivatives, it is clear that u is also a very weak superso-
lution. Let then u be a continuous very weak supersolution. The comparison
property with respect to continuous weak solutions for any space-time cylinder
⋐ ΩT is the content of Lemma 5.2. Thus continuous very weak superso-
Ut1,t2
lutions are m-superporous. Finally, a continuous m-superporous function u is
locally bounded, and hence a weak supersolution by Lemma 5.4.
