Optimization and small-amplitude analysis of

Purcell’s three-link microswimmer model

Oren Wiezel and Yizhar Or ∗

April 5, 2016

Abstract

This work studies the motion of Purcell’s three-link microswimmer in
viscous ﬂow, by using perturbation expansion of its dynamics under small-
amplitude strokes. Explicit leading-order expressions and next-order cor-
rection terms for the displacement of the swimmer are obtained for the
cases of a square or circular gait in the plane of joint angles. The cor-
rection terms demonstrate the reversal in movement direction for large
stroke amplitudes, which has previously only been shown numerically. In
addition, asymptotic expressions for Lighthill’s energetic eﬃciency are ob-
tained for both gaits. These approximations enable calculating optimal
stroke amplitudes and swimmer’s geometry (i.e. ratio of links’ lengths)
for maximizing either net displacement or Lighthill’s eﬃciency.

Introduction

The study of micron-size swimmers dynamics has in recent years become a highly
active research area and has possible implications on understanding the motion
of swimming microorganisms and biological infections [1, 2]. The considerable
advances made in the ﬁeld of micro and nano-technology have promoted the
possibility of manufacturing miniature robotic devices that operate in these
small scales[3, 4, 5]. Such mini-robots may have many applications in medicine,
performing medical procedures in a minimally invasive way and delivering drugs
with high precision [6, 7, 8]. All this requires an understanding of swimming
dynamics at the low Reynolds number regime.

Reynolds number represents the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous
ones. When dealing in microﬂuidics, where the characteristic lengths are ex-
tremely small, hydrodynamic forces are typically governed by very low Reynolds
numbers (Re (cid:28) 1) [9]. The result of this is that the strategy of motion in this
regime needs to be drastically diﬀerent than the familiar motion of larger organ-
isms, such as ﬁsh, that rely on imparting momentum to the surrounding ﬂuid. In

his famous lecture [10], Purcell introduced the ”Scallop theorem” which states
that a swimmer that changes its shape and then changes back to the original
shape by reversing the same sequence will return to the point it started its
motion with no regard to the speed in which any part of the motion is made.
Any reciprocal motion of the swimmer will result in zero net translation. There
are several ways of overcoming the scallop theorem and generating net motion
in a low Reynolds regime. One of them is continuously performing a unidirec-
tional rigid body motion such as a rotating corkscrew. In this way there is no
reciprocal motion and the result is generation of net motion of the swimmer.
This is precisely the method used by the ”Escherichia coli” bacteria to propel
itself [11]. Another way for overcoming the scallop theorem is by making a non-
reciprocal periodic shape change, which will be henceforth called a ”gait”. The
simplest version of such a swimmer, known as ”Purcell’s 3-link swimmer” (Fig-
ure 1), was suggested by Purcell in [10] and can be seen as a simpliﬁed version
of the travelling wave ”Taylor sheet” [12] in two dimensions which is discretized
to have only two degrees of freedom. Purcell’s swimmer is comprised of three
rigid links connected by two rotary joints (see ﬁgure 1). Purcell indicated that
this swimmer could propel itself along a straight line by alternately rotating its
front and back links in a non-reciprocal way (Square gait. Figure 2a). Through
symmetry considerations alone, it can be shown that the three link swimmer
will move along the x axis when using the shape changes suggested by Purcell.
Purcell claimed that determining the direction of net motion (i.e.
forward or
backward) is trivial and left it as ”an exercise for the student”. Only 26 years
later, Becker et al [13] obtained an explicit formulation for the dynamics of this
microswimmer and showed that the direction of net motion actually depends
on the stroke amplitude of joint angles. Speciﬁcally, for small amplitudes the
swimmer will move in one direction but for larger amplitudes the swimmer will
move in the opposite direction. Additionally, [13] studied Lighthill’s energetic
eﬃciency, which is roughly equivalent to the maximal mean speed achievable
under a given mean expenditure of mechanical power. It is worth noting that
both [10] and [13] considered only the case where the joint angles rotate alter-
nately, creating a square gait, and did not study other possible periodic shape
change, such as the circular gait (Figure 2b), at which the two joint angles
oscillate sinusoidally with a quarter-period phase shift.

Some previous works have examined Purcell’s swimmer from diﬀerent prospec-

tives. In [14] Gutman and Or analyze the symmetries of Purcell’s swimmer, de-
rive conditions on gaits that result in movement along the swimmer’s principal
directions, and present motion experiments of a macro-scale robotic swimmer in
a highly viscous ﬂuid. Hatton et al [15] utilize tools of diﬀerential geometry in
order to obtain geometric visualization of performance measures in shape space
(plane), that helps in obtaining optimal gaits. Tam and Hosoi [16], through
numerical computation only, found gaits that achieve optimal translation dur-
ing a period as well as energetically optimal gaits. They also found the optimal
geometry of the swimmer, i. e. ratio between the swimmer’s links lengths, for
these two optimality criteria, again only through numeric calculations.

Aside from numerical computations, another useful approach is obtaining

approximate explicit expressions by using asymptotic analysis.

In microswimmers, this approach dates back to the analysis of Taylor [12],
who showed that the swimming speed of Taylor’s sheet scales quadratically with
the wave’s amplitude at leading order. In [17], this concept was employed on
analysis of self-propulsion of spherical swimmers performing a squirming motion.
For the shape-changing three-link swimmer, one has to utilize the method of
perturbation expansion [18] under the assumption of small stroke amplitudes.
This method was used in [13] for obtaining leading-order expressions for the
motion of Purcell’s swimmer and ﬁnding its optimal geometry.
In the work
[19], leading order expressions were derived using a similar approach and then
used to ﬁnd optimal geometry of the swimmer for the square gait, and for
derivation of an optimal polygonal gait under small joint angles. Interestingly,
there are diﬀerences in the results found in [13], [16] and [19] in terms of the
swimmer’s optimal geometry. Recently, perturbation expansion has become
a more common tool for analysis of simple microswimmers motion in various
cases such as a three-link swimmer with a passive elastic joint [20], a two-

actuated helix [22].

The goal of this work is to introduce a systematic method for analyzing the
dynamics of Purcell’s three link swimmer using perturbation expansion and to
exploit this method to perform optimizations on the swimmer geometry and
stroke amplitude. The main new contributions of this work compared to previ-
ous literature are: a. Formulation of leading-order expression for the displace-
ment under the circular gait (Figure 2b). b. Derivation of the next-order cor-
rections terms for the displacement under both square and circular gaits, which
explicitly show the reversal in movement direction ﬁrst found in [13], as well
as obtaining an approximation for the optimal stroke amplitude. c. Obtaining
leading-order expressions for Lighthill’s energetic eﬃciency of the two presented
gaits and also a next-order term for the square gait, as well as using these expres-
sions to perform optimization of the swimmer’s geometry and stroke amplitude
for maximal eﬃciency. d. Resolving the previously unexplained diﬀerences
between the ﬁndings in [19],[16] and [13] regarding the optimal geometry.

The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents Purcell’s three-
link swimmer model and its equations of motion, the two gaits in question and
the concept of Lighthill’s energetic eﬃciency. Section 3 focuses on perturbation
expansion, and presents a systematic way for deriving the net displacement of
the swimmer in the form of a power series for any gait, and the ﬁrst two terms
are found explicitly for the square and circular ones. The optimal geometry
and stroke amplitude for maximal displacement are also found. This section
also includes the use of perturbation expansion to ﬁnd the period time under
constant joint torque for the square gait, and under constant power for both
square and circular gaits. In section 4 the previous results are used in order
to obtain the leading-order terms of the energetic eﬃciency of the two gaits, as
well as next-order term for the square gait. Optimal geometry and amplitude
are then found for maximal eﬃciency. Finally, section 5 oﬀers our conclusions,
indicating possible future extensions and consequences.

2 Problem formulation

In this section we introduce Purcell’s swimmer model, formulate its dynamic
equations of motion, deﬁne the square and circular gaits and ﬁnally, review the
concept of Lighthill’s energetic eﬃciency. The swimmer in question consists of
three thin rigid links with lengths l0, l1, l2, with l1 = l2 , l = l0 + l1 + l2 and
η = l0
l . The links are connected by two rotary joints whose angles are denoted
by φ1 and φ2 (see ﬁgure 1). The shape of the swimmer will be described by
these two angles φ = (φ1, φ2)T . It is assumed that the swimmer’s motion is
conﬁned to x − y plane. The planar position and orientation of the center link
are denoted by q = (x, y, θ)T . The swimmer is submerged in an unbounded
ﬂuid domain whose motion is governed by Stokes equations under low Reynolds
number [9]. The velocity of the ith link is described by the linear velocity of its
center vi and the link’s angular velocity ωi , which are augmented in the vector

4

Vi = (vi, ωi) ∈ R3. Similarly, let Vb = (vb, ωb) denote the linear and angular
velocities of a body-ﬁxed reference frame. In addition, we deﬁne the indicator
matrix Iij, such that Iij = ±1 if the location of the ith link with respect to
the body frame is aﬀected by the jth joint, with the sign determined by the
direction of the joint axis. Iij = 0 if the jth joint does not aﬀect the ith link.
The internal torques (moments) acting on the joints are denoted by τ1 and τ2.

2.1 Formulation of equations of motion

The kinematic relation between body velocity, joints velocities and links veloc-
ities is given by:

vi = vb + ωbz × (ri − r0) +

where ri is the position of the center of the ith link and bj is the position of the
jth joint. In matrix form, the velocity Vi is related to the body velocity ˙q and
shape velocity ˙φ through:

Vi = Ti(q, φ) ˙q + Ei(q, φ) ˙φ.

The matrices Ti(q, φ) and Ei(q, φ) for i = 0, 1, 2 are given by:

Where α0 = θ, α1 = φ1 − θ, and α2 = θ + φ2 are the absolute orientation angles

viscous drag force fi and torque mi on the ith slender link under planar motion
are proportional to its linear and angular velocities. Thus, we can write the
expression for the drag force and torque exerted on each link:

Where ti = (cos αi, sin αi)T is a unit vector in the axial direction of the ith link
and ni = (− sin αi, cos αi)T is a unit vector in the normal direction. The resis-
tance coeﬃcients for the normal and axial directions are cn = 2ct = 4πµ/log(lc/a)
where µ is the dynamic viscosity of the ﬂuid, a is the radius of the links and
lc is a characteristic length. Since the ratio of the link’s length to its radius is
assumed to be very large, the diﬀerence in the resistance coeﬃcients between
the links is very small and will be neglected. It is also assumed that eﬀects of
hydrodynamic interaction between the links are negligible. Denoting the vector
of forces and torques on the ith link as Fi = (fi, mi) the relation (4) can be
written in matrix form

Since there are no external boundary conditions in the unbounded ﬂuid domain,
the swimmer’s velocity ˙q expressed in body-ﬁxed reference frame is independent
of the position q and thus (11) can be written as (cf. [14]):

Next, we compute the actuation torques acting at the joints, which are de-

kinematic chain ending at the jth joint, these torque are balanced by hydrody-
namic forces and torques fi and mi, giving rise to the following relation:

(20)

The resulting dynamic equations in (11) and (20)are strongly nonlinear. Nev-
ertheless, they can be expanded by assuming small-amplitude changes of the
angles about φ = 0, as explained in Section 3.

2.2 Periodic Gaits

This work considers time-periodic inputs of shape changes φ(t), called gaits,
which represent closed loops in the plane of joint angles.
In particular, we
focus on two speciﬁc possible gaits, square and circular (Figure 2), that are
presented here with ε as a scaling factor of the stroke amplitude, which will
later be assumed small. The time function of the relative angles between the
links can be written as φi(t) = εsi(t) , where si represents the “unscaled” shape
trajectory. Let us also deﬁne the vector s = (s1, s2)T . For the cases of square
and circular gaits, the joint angles can be written as:

Since the equation of motion (11) is time invariant, the net motion is indepen-
dent of time parametrization of the gait. Here, time parametrization of the gaits
was chosen arbitrarily so that the period times are T = 8 for the square gait
and T = 2π for the circular one. The net displacement in the x direction of one

full period will be denoted X and is calculated through X =(cid:82) T

swimming speed is denoted by V = X/T .

2.3 Mechanical power and Eﬃciency

The energetic eﬃciency of a stroke can be deﬁned in a several diﬀerent ways,
cf.
[24]. First, we write an expression for the power exerted by the swimmer.
The mechanical power dissipated by the ﬂuid’s viscous drag forces and torques
on all three links is,

FT

i Vi =

i RiVi.

(23)

P = − 2(cid:88)

On the other hand, the mechanical power expended internally by the actuation
torques is

T
P = τ T ˙φ = ˙φ

W ˙φ.

(24)

(cid:82) T

These last two expressions are equivalent, which can be proven using the re-
lations (19) and (20). The total work can be calculated from here by W =
0 P (t)dt. However, there is no sense in trying to minimize the total work for
a given gait, since moving slower along the gait’s trajecotry will result in less
power and so, less work for the same net displacement which is time-invariant.
Following previous works [13, 16], we use an energetic eﬃciency criterion similar
to that deﬁned by Lighthill in [25] which is the ratio of average power ¯P = W
T
exerted by the swimmer to the power needed to drag the swimmer as a rigid
body at the same mean speed:

ξ =

V 2
¯P

=

X 2
¯P T 2

.

(25)

This deﬁnition is non-unique for a given trajectory φ(σ(t)) and by varying the
gait’s time parametrization σ(t) the average power changes as well. Neverthe-
less, a known result from [13] proves that minimal average power ¯P for a given
gait is obtained by choosing a time parametrization σ(t) for which the instanta-
neous power P (t) is kept constant. Using this particular time parametrization
(which is unique up to multiplying by a positive factor) maximizes the energetic
eﬃciency ξ for a given gait, and this eﬃciency is uniquely determined for any
gait trajectory.

The period time T under a constant mechanical power P = Po can be
found using the following derivation. Consider the gait φ(σ) = φ(σ(t)) where
σ ∈ [σ0, σ1] is a geometric parameter along the gait’s trajectory and σ(t) is its
time parametrization. Using (23), the instantaneous power P (t) can be written
as

(σ)(cid:1) ˙σ2 where, φ

The period time of a gait under constant mechanical power P = Po is thus
obtained as

Substituting (28) into the expression for Lighthill’s eﬃciency (25) under a con-
stant power ¯P = Po, it is clear that the Po cancels out and so the calculations
can be done for Po = 1 without loss of generality. Thus, Lighthill’s eﬃciency of
a gait φ(σ) is uniquely given as:

ξ =

where Tp now denotes the period time under constant power of Po = 1, as given
in (28).

3 Perturbation expansion of the dynamics

In order to ﬁnd the leading-order expressions for the swimmer’s motion us-
ing perturbation expansion [18], the dynamics of the swimmer are expanded
as powers series of the stroke amplitude ε. First, expressions for the instanta-
neous velocities of a swimmer will be derived, followed by solutions for the net
translation over a period for each gait.

3.1 Expansion of swimmer displacement

The position and orientation of the swimmer are now expanded into power series
in ε as:

q(t) = εq(1)(t) + ε2q(2)(t) + ε3q(3)(t) + . . .

And for each coordinate:

x(t) = εx(1)(t) + ε2x(2)(t) + ε3 x(3)(t) + . . .

y(t) = εy(1)(t) + ε2y(2)(t) + ε3 y(3)(t) + . . .

(30)

(31)

(32)

θ(t) = εθ(1)(t) + ε2θ(2)(t) + ε3 θ(3)(t) + . . .

(33)
As mentioned, from the matrix D(θ) in eq. (13) it can be seen that ˙θ is inde-
pendent of θ , and thus, the ODE for θ can be written as:

Explicit expressions for the derivatives are given in appendix A. The ﬁrst-order
derivatives at the origin are zero since G31, G32 are even functions in (φ1, φ2)
and so ˙θ(2) = 0 in (38), implying that θ(2)(t) = 0 is zero (under zero initial
conditions). Now, using the expression for θ(t) we can calculate expansions of
the net motion q(t). First, we expand the matrices in (13) as:

Explicit expressions for the derivatives of elements of G are given in Appendix
A. Due to symmetry of the swimmer and of the gaits, it is known that there
will only be net translation along x direction, which is the axis of the center
link, while rotation and translation in y direction are cancelled out [14]. Thus,
expansions of net displacement X for speciﬁc gaits are calculated next.

3.2 Gait-speciﬁc expressions of the displacement

Once the series expansion for the instantaneous velocities of the swimmer is
derived, it is possible to obtain the net displacement X over a period for a
speciﬁc gait via integration. The following theorem summarizes the results for
the square and circular gaits:

Theorem 3.1. For a symmetric, three linked ”Purcell swimmer” performing a
square or circular gait with amplitude ε, the leading-order term and next-order
correction for the displacement X over one full stroke in the direction of x axis
are given as follows. For the square gait given in (21):

X =

ηl(1 − η)3(η + 3)ε2

− 1
192

ηl(1 − η)3(η7 + 3η6 − 10η5 − 22η4 + 29η3 + 95η2 + 44η + 20)ε4

+ O(ε6).

(43)

For the circular gait given in (22):

X =

ηl(1 − η)3(η + 3)ε2

π
16
− π
1024

ηl(1 − η)3(η7 + 3η6 − 10η5 − 22η4 + 29η3 + 95η2 + 44η + 20)ε4

+ O(ε6).

(44)

It can easily be seen that the leading order term of X is quadratic in ε and
that the next-order corrections are of opposite sign to the leading-order terms,
which indicates the reversal in the direction of the translation at larger stroke
amplitudes and the existence of an optimal amplitude that achieves maximal
displacement.

Proof. To ﬁnd the displacement, we ﬁrst integrate each of eq. (37),(38),(39)
after substituting the gait si(t), square (21) or circular (22). This gives the
rotation angle θ(t), which is substituted into (42) for obtaining the velocities
˙x(t). Next, the velocities are integrated in order to obtain the displacement and
rotation of the swimmer, as detailed next.

Square gait: For the square gait, we focus on the ﬁrst quarter of period,
t ∈ [0, 2] only, and the rest of the period will be obtained later by symmetry

where the second-order term of θ(t) is identically zero. Substituting into (42),

8 ηl(η + 1)(η − 1)2,

(46)
Integrating over 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 then gives the net translation in x for a quarter
gait. Due to symmetries of the swimmer and the gait, this net translation is
the same for every quarter of the gait, while motions in both y and θ cancel
out [14]. Thus, multiplying by 4 the result for the quarter gait gives the full
cycle net translations in x as given in (43). Higher order terms can be derived
similarly, though writing the solution becomes more complicated since higher
order expansions of θ(t) have to be calculated for integration of higher order
terms of X. Finally, note that, a leading-order term for displacement under the
square gait is found in [19] using Lie brackets, and the results are identical to
those given here.

As mentioned, the 2nd order expression for θ(t) is identically zero. The velocity

order terms in ˙x are identically zero.

amplitude ε for (a) Square gait, (b) Circular gait. Solid curves - numerical
integration. Dashed curves - O(ε2) approximation. Dash-dotted curves - O(ε2)
approximation.

As a demonstration of the utility of Theorem 3.1, Figure 3 shows plots of
the displacement X vs. stroke amplitude ε with link ratio of η = 1/3 for both
gaits (a - square, b - circular). The solid curves are obtained from numerical
integration of the nonlinear equations of motion (11), whereas the dashed and
dash-dotted curves are O(ε2) and O(ε4) approximations, respectively. While
the O(ε2)-approximation is monotonic in ε and works only for small stroke
amplitudes, the O(ε4)-approximation with next-order correction captures the
reversal in the direction of the displacement for intermediate amplitudes, though
there is an increasing deviation from the numerical values for larger amplitudes.

3.3 Optimal geometry and stroke amplitude for maximal

displacement

First, we discuss the dependence of net displacement X on the swimmer’s geo-
metric ratio η and derive its optimal values for both gaits, based on equations
(43) and (44). As a demonstration, plots of X vs. η under the square gait are
shown in Figures 4(a) and 4(b) for stroke amplitudes of ε = π/4 and ε = π/2,
respectively. It can be seen that the O(ε2) approximation (dashed) has a larger
deviation from the exact value obtained by numerical integration (solid curves),
compared to that of the O(ε4) approximation (dash-dotted), where the devia-
tions are further increased for larger amplitudes ε. Nevertheless, in all cases it is
obvious that the displacement X vanishes at extreme cases of η → 0 or η → 1,
where either the middle link or side links vanish, and that an optimal value of
η exists that maximizes the displacement X.

We now obtain approximations of the optimal value of η based on the leading-

order O(ε2) terms in (43) and (44).

leading-order expressions for both square and circular gaits are identical up
to multiplication by a constant:

X = Cηl(1 − η)3(η + 3)ε2 + O(ε4),

(49)

4 for the square gait and C = π

with constant C = 1
16 for the circular gait. An
important observation is that this relation is fairly general. That is, for any
small-amplitude gait and any swimmer’s dynamics with the same structure (i.e.
not necessarily assuming resistive force theory), the leading-order term of X can
always be decomposed into a function of swimmer’s geometry multiplied by a
function of the gait’s unscaled trajectory. This key statement is summarized in
the following theorem:

Theorem 3.2. Consider a swimmer with two shape variables whose dynamics
can be written in the form of equation (13), under a small-amplitude gait φ(t) =
εs(t). The leading-order approximation of the swimmer’s displacement X over
one period can be written in the form: X (2) = C(s) · f (η), where C(s) depends
on the shape of the unscaled trajectory and f (η) depends on the swimmer’s
geometric structure.

The theorem, whose proof is detailed in Appendix B, implies that based on
leading order approximation, the optimal geometry is independent of the gait’s
shape. For our particular swimmer model, the geometry-dependent function
f (η) is given in (49). As expected, for the cases of η = 0 and η = 1 the net
displacement vanishes, and the the optimal value of η is easily obtained as η∗ =
−5 + 2
= 0.2649, which results in maximal displacement of X∗ = 0.0859ε2
5
for the square gait and X∗ = 0.0675ε2 for the circular gait. The value of η∗ is

in [13]. This disagreement, which originates from diﬀerences in deﬁnitions and
scaling, is discussed in the sequel.

Next, we use both O(ε2) and O(ε4) terms in (43) and (44) in order to obtain
both optimal ratio η and amplitude ε for the two gaits. The displacement over
one cycle of each gait has the following form:

X = f2(η)ε2 − f4(η)ε4 + O(ε6)

(50)

Where f2 and f4 are given by
f2(η) = C2ηl(1 − η)3(η + 3)
f4(η) = C4ηl(1 − η)3(η7 + 3η6 − 10η5 − 22η4 + 29η3 + 95η2 + 44η + 20)

The polynomials f2(η) and f4(η) are the same for both gaits. However, this is
not true for all gaits. For example, it can be shown that for an elliptical gait,
f4(η) is a diﬀerent polynomial. For a given value of η (50) implies that the
optimal amplitude ε∗ for maximal displacement is given by

(cid:115)

ε∗ =

f2(η)
2f4(η)

.

(51)

(52)

Substituting into (50) one obtains the optimal displacement as

X∗ =

f2(η)
4f4(η)

This implies the existence of an optimal combination of link ratio η and ampli-
tude ε that achieve a global maximum of the displacement. Diﬀerentiating (52)
with respect to η, the optimal value is obtained by ﬁnding the roots of a 9th
order polynomial in η. Since the expression for X∗ in (52) is the same for both
square and circular gaits up to a multiplicative constant, the optimal geome-
try for both gaits is obtained as η∗ = 0.1784. Substituting into (51), optimal
amplitudes ε and displacements X are obtained for each gait as:

ε∗
sqr = 1.568rad = 89.8◦ X∗ = 0.0967
ε∗
cir = 1.810rad = 103.7◦ X = 0.1012

(53)

(54)

Numerically calculating the optimal geometry η and stroke amplitude ε using
MATLAB’s function fmincon gives the following results:

16

Square gait:

Circular gait:

η∗ = 0.2284,
η∗ = 0.2218,

ε∗ = 1.434rad = 82.16◦ X∗ = 0.0905
ε∗ = 1.702rad = 97.57◦ X∗ = 0.0973

The optimal amplitude ε∗ based on O(ε4) approximation is quite close to the
exact value obtained numerically. On the other hand, the large diﬀerence in η∗
can be explained by the large deviation in X for ε ≈ π/2, as seen in Fig. 4(b).
The ﬁgure also shows that the O(ε4) expression for X overestimates the exact
value.

3.4 Comparison to optimal geometry obtained by Becker

et al

As mentioned above, the work of Becker et al [13] obtained a diﬀerent value
of optimal geometry η. The explanation for this diﬀerence is twofold: ﬁrst,
[13] considered maximization of the mean forward velocity under a constant
torque at the joint rather than net displacement. Second, [13] scaled swimming
distance by the side link’s length l1 rather than the total length l.

We now show that by adopting the deﬁnitions of [13] and using our leading-
order expressions in Theorem 3.1, one obtains optimal geometry that agrees
with [13]. First, we consider the case where a constant torque is applied on
the rotating joint in each part of the square gait. The relation between the
joint torques and the joint velocities is given in (16). For the ﬁrst quarter of
the square gait we have that ˙φ1 = 0 and so the second row of (16) is reduced
˙φ2, with Wij the elements of W(φ) deﬁned in (19). Assuming
to τ2 = W22
a constant torque of τ2(t) = τo at the joint for the ﬁrst quarter cycle of the
square gait, we can derive a leading-order expression for the time it would take
to complete the quarter gait and then multiply by four in order to obtain:

(56)

From (56), the optimal geometry that maximizes the leading-order mean veloc-
ity V (1) is obtained as η∗ = 0.646, which is fundamentally diﬀerent from the
optimal geometry for maximal displacement X obtained above.

Becker et al [13] also used a diﬀerent deﬁnition of geometric ratio, denoted
here as ηb = l0/l1. That is, the length is normalized by that of the side links.

Substituting the transformation (57), it can be shown that these expressions
agree with our derivations in (55),(56), and also with our leading order ex-
pression for net displacement X = Vτ Tτ as given in (43). From (59), optimal
geometry for maximizing Vτ has been obtained in [13] as η∗
b = 0.54, which cor-
responds to η = 0.213. The diﬀerence from the optimal value of η = 0.646
obtained by maximizing Vτ in (56) is now due to the fact that (56) is scaled by
l while (59) is scaled by l1.

3.5 Period time under constant power

We now compute series expansions for the period time Tp under constant power
P0 = 1 as formulated in (28), for both square and circular gaits. These ex-
pressions are used in the next section for obtaining approximate expressions of
Lighthill’s energetic eﬃciency according to equation (29). The period time is
expanded into a power series as

Tp = εT (1)

p + ε2T (2)

p + ε3T (3)

p + . . . .

(60)

Explicit expressions for the diﬀerent terms T (i)
depend on the choice of the
p
gait. For the square and circular gaits, these expressions are summarized in the
following theorem.

Theorem 3.3. For a symmetric, three linked ”Purcell swimmer” performing a
square or circular gait with amplitude ε, the period times of one full stroke with
constant power of Po = 1 exerted by the joints are expanded as follows.

The function E(·) in (62) denotes a complete elliptic integral of the second

kind, whose deﬁnition is reviewed in appendix C.

Proof. For each gait trajectory we deﬁne a new parametrization as φ(σ). The
time-parametrization σ(t) that keeps constant power along the gait satisﬁes (27),
and the period time is then calculated by expansion of (28). For the square gait,
as before, we consider only a quarter of the gait and then multiply by four due
to symmetry. Parametrization for the ﬁrst quarter of the gait is

φ1 = ε,
φ2 = −σ,
σ ∈ [−ε, ε].

˙φ1 = 0
˙φ2 = − ˙σ

Using this in equation (28) with F (σ) = W22(φ(σ)) and Po = 1 yields

Which gives the expansion in (61).

For the circular gait, only ﬁrst-order expression for the period time is ob-
tained, due to complexity of the expressions. The parametrization used for this
gait is

φ1 = ε cos(σ),
φ2 = ε sin(σ),
σ ∈ [−π/4, π/4].

In order to validate the expansions of Tp in (61) and (62), Figure 5 plots
the O(ε) and O(ε3) approximations of Tp as a function of stroke amplitude ε,
compared to the exact value of Tp obtained by numerical integration of (28),
for both gaits (a - square, b - circular) under equal links length, η = 1/3. It
can be seen that for small amplitudes, the period time Tp indeed scales linearly
with ε and that for intermediate values of ε the O(ε3) correction term slightly
improves the approximation accuracy (square gait only).

Using the expressions found in (61),(62) for the period times under constant
power, along with previous results of net displacement (43),(44), we now calcu-
late several approximations of Lighthill’s energetic eﬃciency ξ using (29). Then
we obtain optimal values of length ratio η and stroke amplitude ε for maximal

Explicit approximations for the eﬃciency ξ under square and circular gaits, are

integration is plotted in solid curve. While the O(ε2) approximation grows
monotonically with ε, adding the next-order correction of O(ε4) also captures
a local maximum in the eﬃciency, which is obtained at an intermediate stroke
amplitude of ε ≈ 1. Nevertheless, this approximation of ξ becomes negative for
larger values of ε, which is nonphysical according to the deﬁnition of ξ in (29).
A more reasonable approximation is obtained by plugging the O(ε4) and O(ε3)
approximations for X and Tp, respectively, into (29). With a slight abuse of
notation, this approximation is denoted here as O(ε4/3), and is given by

A plot of this approximation is overlayed as a dotted line in Figure 6a. It can
be seen that the O(ε4/3) approximation is always positive, and more accurately
follows the exact value of ξ for moderate stroke amplitudes, while the O(ε4)
approximation achieves smaller errors for small ε (diﬀerences are not visible in
the plot). Finally, it can be seen from the plot that the exact value of ξ attains
a global maximum value at ε ≈ 3, where the direction of swimming is reversed.
This second maximum is not captured by any of the approximate expressions
mentioned above. Nevertheless, as already mentioned in [13], this maximum
at large strokes where the joint angles approach ±π is often impractical, due
to possible collisions between the links. Moreover, resistive force theory which
assumes negligible hydrodynamic interaction between the links is no longer valid
in this range [26]. Thus, we focus here on approximations of the ﬁrst maximum
of ξ which is attained at moderate amplitudes, as discussed next.

Eﬃciency optimization - square gait: We now use the approximations of
Lighthill’s energetic eﬃciency in order to obtain optimal values of both length
ratio η and stroke amplitude ε. Using only the leading-order approximation of
the eﬃciency in (73) gives an optimal length ratio of η∗ = 0.327. Taking also the
next-order correction term into account and implementing the same calculation
steps shown above in section 33.3, the optimal geometry and amplitude are
obtained as:

η∗ = 0.2853

ε∗ = 0.908rad = 52◦ξ = 0.5838

(76)

Using O(ε(4/3)) approximation, the optimal geometry and amplitude are ob-
tained by solving a system of two polynomial equations as:

η∗ = 0.2754

ε∗ = 1.1038rad = 63.2◦

ξ = 0.7294

(77)

Finally, numerical calculation of ξ under the square gait and conducting opti-
mization using MATLAB’s function fmincon gives optimal values of:

η∗ = 0.2879

ε∗ = 1.133rad = 64.9◦

ξ = 0.7709

Figure 6b shows a plot the approximations of ξ as a function of η for a large
amplitude of ε = 1, compared to the exact computation of ξ obtained numeri-
cally. While there are large discrepancies in the value of the eﬃciency ξ (best
captured by the O(ε4/3) approximation), all approximations predict optimal
values around η ≈ 0.3.

4.2 Circular gait

For the circular gait, the constant-power period time Tp has been approximated
only to ﬁrst order O(ε) in (62). Using (44), the expansion of Lighthill’s eﬃciency
in (72) can thus be obtained only to leading order, as:

ξ = ε2

shown in solid curves. As before, the leading-order O(ε2) approximation does
not capture the optimum with respect to amplitude but both approximations
capture optimum with respect to η.

Eﬃciency optimization - circular gait: Using the leading-order approxi-
mation for ξ in (79) and numerically searching for maximum with respect to η,
optimal geometry is obtained as η∗ = 0.3139, with an eﬃciency of ξ(2) = 1.5565.
Using the O(ε4/1) approximation in (80), optimal values of both ε and η are
obtained numerically as:

η∗ = 0.2379

ε∗ = 1.3821rad = 79.2◦

ξ = 1.22.

(81)

Finally, numerical calculation of ξ under the circular gait conducting optimiza-
tion using MATLAB’s fmincon function give optimal values of:

η∗ = 0.2684

ε∗ = 1.3747rad = 78.8◦

ξ = 1.2777.

(82)

Again, the O(ε4/1) expression in (80) achieves a reasonable approximation of
the optimum, as also seen from Figures 7a and 7b.
An important observation is that even in leading order O(ε2) approximation
of Lighthill’s energetic eﬃciency ξ, the optimal geometry η∗ for maximizing ξ
actually depends on the shape of the chosen gait trajectory. This can clearly
be seen in the diﬀerent dependence of ξ(2) on η in (73) and (79). This is
a substantial diﬀerence from the case of maximizing displacement X, where
dependence of the leading-order approximation in η is independent of the gait’s
shape, as manifested in Theorem 3.2.

In this work we have analyzed the motion of the three-link ”Purcell swimmer”.
We provided a systematic method for deriving an expansion of the velocities of
the swimmer and presented leading order expressions and next-order corrections
for the net displacement over one period in the cases of a square and circular
gait. Examination of the correction terms conﬁrms that there is a reversal in the
direction of the net displacement at high amplitudes, a result which has previ-
ously only been shown numerically. The gait amplitude and swimmer geometry
that optimize the displacement over one period were approximated using the
ﬁrst two terms in the expansion. Additionally, by writing asymptotic expres-
sions for the period time under constant power expenditure, we were able to
write, for the ﬁrst time, leading-order term for the energetic eﬃciency of the
square and circular gaits as well as a next-order correction term for the square
gait. Once again, we used the obtained expressions in order to ﬁnd the energet-
ically optimal gait amplitude and swimmer geometry. The results demonstrate
the utility of perturbation methods for obtaining approximate explicit expres-
sions for nonlinear dynamics of locomotion systems, which enable analysis and
optimization of their performance.

We now brieﬂy discuss some limitations of this work and list possible di-
rections for future extension of the research. First, the optimization conducted
on the gaits in this work was limited to varying the amplitude of predeﬁned
shape trajectories and did not address the possibility of other gaits which may
have better performance. By utilizing tools of optimal control with the leading
order expressions for the swimmer velocities, optimal gaits can be found that
will maximize the displacement or energetic eﬃciency, similar to those obtained
numerically in [16]. Second, experiments conducted on a macro-scale swimmer
prototype in a highly viscous ﬂuid [14] have recently demonstrated the symme-
try properties of Purcell’s swimmer performing certain symmetric gaits. Similar
experiments can be done to verify some results from this paper, e.g. the depen-
dency of net displacement on swimmer geometry and gait amplitude. Finally,
in many practical situations the actuation of robotic swimmers will likely be by
applying torques at the joints rather than prescribing the joint angles directly
[27]. This calls for the formulation of an asymptotic expansion of the relation
between the joint torques and the joint angles.

Appendix B: Leading-order dependency on η

Here we prove that the leading-order expression for the x displacement of any
periodic gait can be decomposed into the product of two parts, one depending
only on the swimmer’s geometry and the other depending only on the shape of
gait trajectory. The result of this is that to leading order, the displacement of
a given swimmer is the same for any gait up to a constant, and so we can ﬁnd
a swimmer geometry which optimizes the displacement for all gaits.

Theorem 3.2. Consider a swimmer with two shape variables whose dynamics
can be written in the form of equation (13), under a small-amplitude gait φ(t) =
εs(t). The leading-order approximation of the swimmer’s displacement X over
one period can be written in the form: X (2) = C(s) · f (η), where C(s) depends
on the shape of the unscaled trajectory and f (η) depends on the swimmer’s
geometric structure.
