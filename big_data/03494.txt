ABSTRACT

Taking advantage of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe82, we have explored the spatial
distribution of ultra diﬀuse galaxies (UDGs) within an area of 8×8 Mpc2 centered around
the galaxy cluster Abell 168 (z=0.045). This intermediate massive cluster (σ=550 km/s) is
surrounded by a complex large scale structure, rich in ﬁlaments and groups. This allows us
to probe the large scale distribution of UDGs and address the question whether the infalling
structures fed the cluster with new UDGs. We ﬁnd that UDGs are located within the large
scale structures that comprise the Abell 168 overdensity. Approximately 42% of the UDGs
analysed inhabit the cluster region: ∼7±3% in the core and ∼35±7% in the outskirts whereas
the remaining UDGs are found outside the main overdensity: ∼19±5% in groups and ∼40% in
ﬁlaments. UDGs structural properties gradually change from the lowest to the densest regions
with a decrease of their stellar mass by a factor of ∼1.5, an increase of their S´ersic index n by a
factor of ∼1.25 and a decrease in their axis ratio (b/a) by a factor of ∼1.13. This transformation
supports the idea that UDGs probably form outside clusters and are later on accreted towards
the cluster’s central regions, where they are ﬁnally destroyed by disruption. Finally, the spatial
distribution of the UDGs is very similar to the one found for dwarf galaxies but signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from the distribution of galaxies like the Milky Way, suggesting that UDGs could be
bona ﬁde dwarfs and not failed L⋆ galaxies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Following pioneering work by Impey et al. (1988), Bothun et al.
(1991) and Dalcanton et al. (1997), a number of recent works
(e.g. van Dokkum et al. 2015; Koda et al. 2015; Mihos et al. 2015;
van der Burg et al. 2016), using deep imaging of nearby clusters,
have focused their attention on a type of low mass (107-108 M⊙),
low surface brightness (24<µg(0)<26 mag arcsec−2) and extended
size (1.5<re<4.5 kpc) galaxies. These objects have been named
ultra-diﬀuse galaxies (UDGs). UDGs have been found mostly in
galaxy clusters. However, it is unclear whether this is just a bias
due to the strategy used to detect these objects. Due to their ex-
treme low surface brightness, obtaining a spectroscopic redshift of
these galaxies is very time consuming and their ”redshifts” have
been guessed by their proximity to a high density region. In fact,
of the two UDGs conﬁrmed spectroscopically (van Dokkum et al.
2015; Martinez-Delgado et al. 2016), one is in Coma and the other
one is in a much lower density environment. Moreover, there are
also known a small number of large, low surface brightness galax-

ies in the ﬁeld (Dalcanton et al. 1997; Burkholder et al. 2001).
Nonetheless, despite the observational bias towards galaxy clusters,
the fact that the number of UDGs increases with cluster richness
(van der Burg et al. 2016), with almost doubling the population of
known galaxies in Coma (Koda et al. 2015) to barely adding a few
candidates in Fornax (Mu˜noz et al. 2015) suggests that the environ-
mental density could play a role on the origin of the UDGs.

From the theoretical point of view, Yozin & Bekki (2015) have
shown that a scenario in which UDGs are satellites of a cluster, hav-
ing infall early at z∼2 and quenching their further growth, is able to
reproduce the structural properties of these objects. Interestingly,
one of the predictions of this scenario is that UDGs should not
survive close to the center of the clusters as tides exerted by the
cluster mass within that region will prune the infalling UDGs. This
seems to be in agreement with the ﬁndings of van der Burg et al.
(2016). For all the above reasons, it is clear that understanding
in which environments UDGs are originally formed, i.e. whether
they have been formed in-situ in the clusters or whether they have
been accreted through infalling substructures (group, ﬁlaments) is
fundamental to disentangle the origin of these mysterious galax-
ies. Another key feature to understand better the ultimate nature

of the UDGs is to compare their spatial distribution with two dif-
ferent families of galaxies: dwarf versus L⋆. According to some
authors, UDGs could be understood as failed L⋆ galaxies (e.g.
van Dokkum et al. 2015) whereas for others, UDGs are regular
dwarf galaxies (e.g. Beasley et al. 2016) inhabiting high-spin ha-
los (Amorisco & Loeb 2016). Addressing which spatial distribu-
tion UDGs resemble most can add extra light on the origin of these
galaxies.

In this paper, we explore the distribution and properties of
the population of UDGs in and around the Abell 168 galaxy
cluster (z=0.045). Abell 168 is a cluster with a richness II-
III (BM classiﬁcation) located at R.A.(2000)=01h15m12.0s and
Dec (2000)=+00d19m48s. This cluster has a velocity disper-
sion of σ=550 km/s and a dynamical mass Mdyn=5.2×1014 M⊙
(Yang et al. 2004). The large scale structure surrounding this clus-
ter is especially attractive to explore in which environments UDGs
are born. In fact, around Abell 168 we can ﬁnd many ﬁlaments and
galaxy groups, as well as a number of low density regions. Partic-
ularly important for the work we want to conduct here, our large
scale structure is fully embedded within the deep Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) Stripe82. This means that we have very deep pho-
tometry in 3 SDSS bands (g=25.2 mag, r=24.7 mag, i=24.3 mag;
3σ point sources). This implies having an extra ﬁlter compared to
previous UDG works in other clusters. We will show that this extra
ﬁlter is key to clean our galaxy sample from background contami-
nants. This will allow us to select UDG candidates at the redshift of
the cluster but signiﬁcantly further away from its center. To charac-
terize in great detail the large scale structure around Abell 168, we
use the deep spectroscopic coverage of this ﬁeld produced by the
SDSS survey in this area of the Stripe82. In this paper, we explore
a ﬁeld of view of 2.5×2.5 degrees, equivalent to 8×8 Mpc around
this cluster.

The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes
the data used. We explain how UDGs were identiﬁed in Section
3. The structural properties of the UDG sample is detailed in Sec-
tion 4 and their spatial distribution is indicated in Section 5. The
analysis of the eﬀect of the local environment on the structural and
color properties of the UDGs are described in Section 6. Section
7 address a potential link between UDGs and regular dwarf galax-
ies. Finally, Section 8 presents a discussion of the results whereas
Section 9 summarize our main ﬁndings. Throughout this paper, we
adopt the following cosmology Ωm=0.3, ΩΛ=0.7 and H0=70 km
s−1 Mpc−1. At the redshift of Abell Cluster 168, the spatial scale is
0.885 kpc/′′. We use the AB-magnitude system in this work.

2 DATA

The images used in this paper were obtained from The IAC Stripe
82 Legacy Survey1 (Fliri & Trujillo 2016). The IAC Stripe 82
Legacy Survey consists on a new deep co-adds of data taken within
Stripe 82 of the SDSS, especially stacked to reach the faintest sur-
face brightness limits of this data set (r∼28.5 mag/arcsec2 is the av-
erage surface brightness limit 3σ obtained in 10×10 arcsec boxes).
The Stripe82 covers a 2.5 degree wide region along the celestial
equator (-50◦< R.A. < 60 ◦, -1.25 ◦< Dec. < 1.25 ◦) with a total of
275 square degrees. The pixel scale of the imaging is 0.396′′. This
region of the sky has been imaged repeatedly approximately 80
times in all the ﬁve SDSS ﬁlters (u, g, r, i and z). The IAC project

provides the imaging dataset in 0.5×0.5 degrees blocks. We cre-
ated a ﬁnal mosaic of 2.5×2.5 degrees using SWarp2 (Bertin et al.
2002) centered approximately at the coordinates of the Abell 168
cluster (R.A.=18.8◦, Dec.=0.33◦). The limiting surface brightness
of the entire region was measured in each 0.5×0.5 degrees block.
We found that the surface brightness depth across the whole area is
rather homogeneous, with a mean depth at the 3σ level (in 10×10
arcsec boxes) of 29.2, 28.7 and 28.2 mag arcsec−2 in the g, r and i
ﬁlters respectively.

3 IDENTIFICATION

The goal of this paper is to ﬁnd UDGs in and around Abell 168. To
this aim we ran SExtractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) on the entire
mosaic. SExtractor ran in the above 3 ﬁlters plus another ﬁlter pro-
vided by the IAC project ”r-deep” which is the combination of g, r
and i. As we are interested in detecting extended sources with very
low surface brightness, we put a detection threshold in all the bands
of 1σ and a minimum area of 25 pixels (i.e. 4 arcsec2 or 3 kpc2 at
the cluster redshift). With these settings, SExtractor found a total
of 331891 sources in the r-deep ﬁlter. We further reduced our list
of galaxies by requesting that the sources were identiﬁed in all the
above bands and had simultaneously a stellarity (CLASS STAR)
below 0.15 in all ﬁlters (to avoid selecting point-like objects).

The next selection criteria was based on the photometric color
(MAG AUTO) of the sources. We conservatively select the follow-
ing ranges: 0<g-r<1.2, 0<g-i<1.7 and -0.2<r-i<0.7. These color
intervals are broader than the expected color values for the galaxy
population (red and blue) at the cluster redshift (as we will show
later). After all these selection criteria we are left with 75666 galax-
ies.

Identifying UDGs requires a measurement of the size and
surface brightness of the galaxies. For this reason, we ran on all
the preselected galaxies the IMFIT code (Erwin 2015). We used
a S´ersic model (Sersic 1968) to extract the structural parameters
of our sources. Input parameters for the ﬁtting as coordinates of
the source, position angle and eﬀective radius are provided using
the output parameters from the previous SExtractor run. IMFIT ran
over the g, r and i ﬁlters. For each individual ﬁtting we masked
all the pixels of nearby sources detected by SExtractor. The S´ersic
models were convolved with the PSF of the images. These PSFs
are provided by the IAC Stripe82 Legacy Survey for each individ-
ual block.

The structural parameters obtained from the S´ersic ﬁt are: po-
sition angle, ellipticity, S´ersic index n, eﬀective radius re and total
magnitude in each ﬁlter. We tried up to three slightly diﬀerent in-
put parameters in each individual ﬁtting for ensuring robustness on
the output structural parameters of IMFIT. In the vast majority of
the cases the diﬀerence in the IMFIT results is negligible, but to
be consistent we use the mean values of the outputs. We compare
the magnitude and eﬀective radius values from IMFIT and SEx-
tractor as a quality check of the ﬁtting process and we obtain a very
good correlation between both magnitudes and a reasonable good
correlation for the eﬀective radius (see Fig. A1 in the Appendix).
SExtractor eﬀective radius does not account by the PSF eﬀect, so
it is expected that their values are always slightly larger than the
ones obtained by the IMFIT code, particularly for the most compact
sources. Those objects which showed large magnitude diﬀerences

to their colors.

(>1 mag) between IMFIT and SExtractor were ﬂagged and visu-
ally inspected. These objects represent a tiny fraction of the total
number of ﬁtted sources (∼0.5% in g band). They are usually ar-
tifacts of the image, interacting galaxies, very bright galaxies with
multiple pieces detected by SExtractor, bad ﬁts of the IMFIT code,
etc. We do not further considered these objects in the analysis.

3.1 Selection of UDGs

Following previous works in the literature, the selection of UDGs
in our ﬁeld is based on the size and surface brightness of the
galaxies. We use the structural parameters (magnitude, eﬀective
radius, n and ellipticity) provided by IMFIT to do our ﬁnal cut.
The magnitudes of the galaxies were corrected by the dust ex-
tinction of our Galaxy. Across the ﬁeld of view, the dust extinc-
tion is relatively homogeneous and we select the following correc-
tions: 0.098, 0.068 and 0.051 mag for the g, r and i ﬁlters respec-
tively (Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011). In addition, we corrected by
the (1 + z)4 cosmological dimming, which at the cluster redshift is
0.19 mag/arcsec2.

Assuming that UDGs are well described by an exponential
light distribution, van Dokkum et al. (2015) use the following cri-
teria to select them: µg(0)>24 mag/arcsec2 and semimajor eﬀective
radius re >1.5 kpc. Koda et al. (2015), analyzing a large number
of UDG candidates, show that their S´ersic index n distribution
peaks towards slightly lower values than n=1 (see their Fig. 4).
They also ﬁnd that their axis ratio distribution has a broad shape
with a maximum around 0.75. To be conservative and account for
a generous distribution of the structural parameters of the UDGs,
in this paper we use the following criteria:

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

(i) µg(0)>23.8 mag/arcsec2 after correction by cosmological
dimming and dust extinction. µg(0) is obtained using a S´ersic model
with n free. Note that if the dust extinction were not taken into ac-
count nor the cosmological dimming, our selection criteria selects
objects with µg,observed(0)>24.1 mag/arcsec2.

(ii) Circularized Re>1.25 kpc. Taking into account the typical
axis ratio measured for these objects, this is equivalent to select
galaxies with semimajor eﬀective radius re&1.5 kpc.

After applying these criteria we get 148 UDG candidates. All
these candidates were visually inspected in order to eliminate arti-
facts misclassiﬁed as real UDGs. Examples of incorrectly detected
UDGs are: groups of sources detected as a single object by SEx-
tractor or mergers of galaxies. To visually discard some of these
contaminants, we took advantage of color stamps created by the
combination of g, r and i ﬁlters. After this visual inspection we are
left with 102 galaxies.

The next step is to select the UDG galaxies that are at the
distance of the Abell 168 structure and its surrounding. Lacking
spectroscopic redshifts for our faint sources, the approach we have
followed is to study the distribution of the colors of the galaxies
that have spectroscopic redshifts in the ﬁeld compatible with being
at the cluster redshift (i.e. z=0.045). In particular, we have selected
all the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts 0.04<z<0.05 (i.e. those
compatible with being within 3σ the velocity distribution of the
Abell 168 cluster). The color-magnitude and color-color map for
these sources is presented in Fig. 1 as blue stars. The limiting ap-
parent magnitude in this ﬁeld for having spectroscopic redshift is
g∼19 mag. As it can be seen, the galaxies with spectroscopic red-
shifts have a broad distribution in color, ranging from red galaxies
deﬁning a clear red sequence to objects following a blue cloud.
The individual error in magnitude for each of the sources is key to

characterize the broadening of the color distribution3, particularly
in the color-color maps. We have used the magnitude determina-
tion for each of our spectroscopic sources using regular SDSS data
(that data is ∼2 mag shallower than Stripe82). On doing this, we
have (for the faintest galaxy with spectroscopic redshift) an uncer-
tainty in the color-color map that is pretty close to the one we get
for the ∼2 mag fainter UDGs using Stripe82 data.

The ﬁnal action is to separate galaxies compatible with having
the same color distribution as the spectroscopic sample. We require
our ﬁnal candidates to be simultaneously within the color distribu-
tions of the spectroscopic sample in the color-color map shown in
Fig. 1. To do this, we estimate the distance of each of our UDGs
candidates in the 2D color space (g-r,r-i) to the third nearest galaxy
with spectroscopy. We select the third nearest object to have a much

robust estimation than just using the ﬁrst. We ask for the 3rd ob-
ject to be nor further away than 0.1 mag in this color-color plane.
Those UDGs satisfying this restriction are shown with red sym-
bols, those with colors not compatible with the spectroscopic sam-
ple with green dots. Our ﬁnal sample of UDGs compatible with
being at the redshift of Abell 168 consists of 74 objects. A repre-
senative sample of these UDGs is shown in Fig.2. The sample of
diﬀuse galaxies with colors incompatible with being at the clus-
ter distance is 28. This implies a typical contamination level for
surveys like ours that have not this extra color of ∼30%. The aver-
age colors of the contaminant galaxies are: < g − r >=0.60±0.06
and < r − i >=0.28±0.05. Despite we have used a third ﬁlter to
clean our sample of contaminants, it is clear that still we should
have a level of contamination due to foreground and background
objects. Not having spectroscopic redshifts to estimate accurately
how much this contamination could be, we guess that it should not
be very high as the vast majority of our UDGs are spatially dis-
tributed following the large scale structure in the ﬁeld traced by the
galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts.

4 STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF THE UDG SAMPLE

Once the sample of UDGs compatible with being at the redshift of
cluster Abell 168 is selected, we explore the distribution of their
structural properties (see Table B1). This is shown in Fig. 3. We
show in that ﬁgure, for each ﬁlter, the distribution of the S´ersic in-
dex n, the axis ratio, the circularized eﬀective radius Re and the
average surface brightness <µe>. The distribution of all the struc-
tural properties is quite similar in all the bands (see Fig. A2), ex-
cept as expected for <µe> which changes due to the colors of the
UDGs. As it has been found in previous works (e.g. Koda et al.
2015; van der Burg et al. 2016) the S´ersic indeces n of the UDGs
are slightly below 1, with a peak around 0.7 (< ng >=0.63,
< nr >=0.72 and < ni >=0.72). Interestingly, almost none of the
UDGs has n>1.5. Also, the axis ratio of these objects is around 0.7,
suggesting an spheroidal shape. Moreover, the number of objects
with circularized eﬀective radius larger than 1.5 kpc declines very
fast.

The apparent g-band magnitude of the UDGs in our cluster
area is 20.5<g<22.5 mag. This implies having an absolute magni-
tude of -16.Mg.-14 mag. To put our UDGs in context with the rest
of the galaxies in the Abell 168 area, we show in Fig. 4 the size ver-
sus the absolute g-band magnitude for all the galaxies in the ﬁeld
of view at the redshift of the cluster. Galaxies with spectroscopic
redshifts are shown with blue stars. We have also included galax-
ies with photometric redshifts (purple dots) using the catalog from
Reis et al. (2012). A galaxy with photometric redshift is plotted if
its redshift is compatible within being at the redshift of the cluster.
We have selected those that are less than 3σ (with σ the photomet-
ric redshift error) away from z=0.045 and with photometric redshift
less than 0.15. For the UDGs in our sample is not realistic to use the
photometric redshift from Reis et al. (2012). The reason is that the
UDGs are signiﬁcantly more fainter (in terms of surface brightness)

Galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts are shown with blue stars, whereas
galaxies with photometric redshifts are shown with purple dots. The UDGs
are plotted with red hexagons. The approximate value for the FHWM of
the images is 1 arcsec. In the ﬁgure we plot with an horizontal dashed line
the value of FWHM/2 which is equivalent to 0.45 kpc at the redshift of the
cluster. The inclined dashed lines indicate equal average surface brightness.

than the more compact galaxies with the same absolute magnitude.
This produces a very large uncertainty at measuring their photo-
metric redshifts.

As it has been found previously (see e.g. Koda et al. 2015;
Mu˜noz et al. 2015), Fig. 4 shows that there is a region where galax-

ies considered as ”normal” dwarfs and UDGs overlap. This is re-
lated to the criteria used for selecting UDGs which uses the central
surface brightness (a quantity that it is not directly measured but
extrapolated from the S´ersic ﬁt to the surface brightness distribu-
tion of the galaxies). The apparent relation between the size of the
UDGs and their absolute magnitude (found here and in previous
works) is an artifact produced by the limiting surface brightness of
the surveys.

Finally, we quantify the stellar mass distribution of our UDG
galaxies. To conduct such estimation we take advantage of our
color measurements. In particular, we use g-r to determine the
mass-to-light ratio in r-band (M/L)r. We follow the recipe by
Bell et al.
(2003). We have used a Kroupa (2001) Initial Mass
Function (IMF). The stellar mass distribution of our galaxies is
shown in Fig. 5. The stellar mass distribution of our UDGs peaks
around 108 M⊙, similar to previous works using surveys with sim-
ilar depths (see e.g. van der Burg et al. 2016). As a comparison we
show the stellar mass distribution of the galaxies with spectroscopic
redshift 0.04<z<0.05.

5 SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF UDGS IN THE LARGE

SCALE STRUCTURE

The goal of this paper is to explore how UDGs are spatially dis-
tributed in a large variety of environments. Once the ﬁnal sam-
ple of UDGs are selected, we can probe whether they preferen-
tially inhabit a particular region of the large scale structure sur-
rounding Abell Cluster 168. We show the spatial distribution of
the UDGs and the galaxies with spectroscopic redshift compati-
ble with being at the cluster distance in Fig. 6. The size of the
area shown is limited by the declination width of the Stripe82 sur-
vey (2.5◦). In the R.A. direction we have expanded the area shown
by 0.25◦in each side to illustrate how the large scale structure in
that direction is continued. This is illustrated with a darker blue
color. The blue stars are the galaxies with spectroscopic redshift at
0.04<z<0.05. Large blue stars correspond to the dominant galax-
ies in each prominent substructure: UGC00797 (R.A.=18.73996,
Dec.=0.43081 z=0.04482), UGC00842 (R.A.=19.72338 Dec.=-
1.00199 z=0.04526) and UGC00753 (R.A.=18.01924 Dec.=-
0.24512 z=0.04420). These galaxies are shown in Fig. 7. Red
hexagons are the UDGs. To enhance the visibility of the large scale
structure in Fig. 6 we have estimated the density distribution of
the galaxies with spectroscopic redshift at 0.04<z<0.05 using a bin

size of 0.1◦×0.1◦. Then, we have smoothed the histogram to ease
the visualization.

The most prominent structure, located a little above the cen-
tral part of the plot, is the Abell Cluster 168. This cluster is not
fully relaxed, with an overdensity of galaxies slightly oﬀset from
the position of the main galaxy UGC00797 (Yang et al. 2004). The
whole central structure has a radius of ∼1.5 Mpc. The other two
most conspicuous structures are the fossil group centered around
the galaxy UGC00842 (Lopes de Oliveira et al. 2010) (bottom left
corner of the ﬁgure) and the group around UGC00753. There are
another substructures which are ﬁlamentary-like, also a big empty
region in the bottom right part of the image. The most remarkable
result is that UDGs trace the large scale structure of spectroscopic
galaxies. In the next section, we quantify this result more precisely.

6 THE ENVIRONMENT OF UDGS

We characterize the environment around each UDG by determining
the average distance to its ﬁrst ﬁve neighbors with stellar masses
>109.5 M⊙: <r5>. The mass limit is chosen motivated by the stellar
mass distribution shape of the galaxies with spectroscopy in Fig. 5,
which suggests that the spectroscopic sample is complete for stel-
lar masses above this value (see also Fig. 4 in Cebri´an & Trujillo
2014). In addition, we take the average distance to the closest 5
neighbors to have a robust estimation (i.e. not strongly aﬀected by
shot noise) of the typical distance to the neighbor galaxies. We as-
sume that both the UDGs and the galaxies with spectroscopic red-
shifts are all at the same comoving radial distance (i.e. z=0.045).
The result of our analysis is shown in Fig. 8. For comparison, we
also show the local density distribution of all the galaxies with spec-
troscopic redshift in the cluster (i.e. also including the ones with
<109.5 M⊙) and its surrounding large scale structure. To contextu-
alize the meaning of our local densities, we also show with vertical
lines the range in density found for spectroscopic galaxies placed
in the core (R<0.5 Mpc) of the Abell Cluster 168 (R.A.=18.85,
Dec=0.25) and the cluster outskirts (within an annulus of 0.5<R<2
Mpc). We also show the density range for galaxies located in the
groups surrounding UGC00753 and UGC00842 (R<1 Mpc) and
the galaxies in the ﬁlaments (i.e. those galaxies not located in the
Abell Cluster nor in the groups).

Around 60% of the galaxies with spectroscopic redshift
0.04<z<0.05 are located in regions with density as the inner R=0.5
Mpc of the Abell cluster 168. The UDGs are distributed in our ﬁeld
of view as follows: 7±3% in the cluster core region, 35±7% in the
outskirt of the cluster, 19±5% in the two main groups and 39±7%
in the ﬁlaments. Most of the UDGs are located in environments
with low densities. The number densities of UDGs in each of the
structures are: 6±3 Mpc−2 in the cluster core, 2.2±0.4 Mpc−2 in the
cluster outskirts, 2.2±0.5 Mpc−2 in the main groups surrounding
the cluster and 0.6±0.1 Mpc−2 in the ﬁlaments. The contribution in
stellar mass of the UDGs to the total stellar mass above 3×109 M⊙
in each substructure are: ∼0.06% in the cluster core, ∼0.17% in the
outskirt of the cluster, ∼0.13% in the two main groups and ∼0.37%
in the ﬁlaments. The contribution of UDGs to the total stellar mass
in the cluster is ∼0.23%, a number in good agreement to the one re-
ported by van der Burg et al. (2016), 0.2%. In the next section, we
explore whether the environment of the galaxies aﬀect their struc-
tural and color properties. Exploring this is key to disentangling the
origin and evolution of UDGs.

6.1 Structural properties of UDGs as a function of their

environment

If UDGs are progressively infalling to the cluster center, it would be
expected that during such process their structural properties could
be modiﬁed until they become disrupted (Yozin & Bekki 2015). We
explore whether there is any hint of such a transformational process
in our UDGs. Fig. 9 shows the structural properties of the UDGs
and the rest of the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in our sam-
ple versus their local density.

To explore any trend between the structural parameters and
local density, we separate our sample of UDGs in two groups with
similar number of galaxies: those with < r5 > <0.45 Mpc and those
with < r5 > >0.45 Mpc. In Table 1 we show the results of this
exercise. We do not ﬁnd any relevant eﬀect on the Re as a function
of the local environment and only a marginal trend towards fainter

Our results remain unchanged if we concentrate our attention
to the most extreme UDGs in our sample (i.e. those having Re>1.5
kpc and µg(0)>24.3 mag/arcsec2, a total of 23 objects, see Fig. 4).
By the most extreme UDGs we mean those that depart more signiﬁ-
cantly from the bulk of the dwarf population at the same brightness.

6.2 Color of UDGs as a function of their environment

the color distribution
In this section, we explore whether
of
the UDGs depend on the environment where they live.
van Dokkum et al. (2015) ﬁnd an average color of <g-i>=0.8±0.1.
This color is in close agreement with our ﬁnding here 0.73±0.03
(r.m.s.=0.24). According to van Dokkum et al. (2015), this color
can be either reproduced by a stellar population with 7 Gyr and
[Fe/H]=-1.4 or a population with 4 Gyr and [Fe/H]=-0.8. In both

cases, this corresponds to galaxies signiﬁcantly younger than the
most massive galaxies of the cluster. Similarly, van der Burg et al.
(2016) ﬁnd a typical color of g-r=0.6 (we ﬁnd <g-r>=0.51±0.02
with r.m.s.=0.17) which implies an age of 2 Gyr assuming so-
lar metallicity or 6 Gyr with [Fe/H]=-0.7. Our average color val-
ues are compatible also with relatively modest ages: 5.6 Gyr
([Fe/H]=-1.3) or 2 Gyr ([Fe/H]=-0.7) unless an extremely low
metallicity [Fe/H]=-1.7 is considered which would imply ∼12.5
Gyr (Vazdekis et al. 2015). It is worth noting that if we were not
corrected by the contaminants, the average colors would be slightly
redder: <g-r>0.53±0.02 and <r-i>0.24±0.02. Finally, if we focus
on the most extreme UDGs, we ﬁnd: <g-r>0.49±0.02 and <r-
i>0.20±0.02, very similar to the colors we have for the total sample.

We can now take a look to the color distribution of the UDGs
as a function to their local density as characterized by the average

the colors and spatial distribution of UDGs are similar to the
dwarf (1<M⋆<3×109M⊙) galaxies with spectroscopic redshift in
our area4. For these galaxies we ﬁnd the following colors: <g-
r>=0.48±0.02 and <r-i>=0.25±0.01, very similar to the colors we
get for the UDGs. Their spatial distribution is also compatible to
the UDGs. We ﬁnd 9±5% in the cluster core region, 34±9% in
the outskirts of the cluster, 17±6% in the two main groups and
40±9% in the ﬁlaments. On doing exactly the same analysis but for
galaxies with ∼5×1010M⊙ (i.e. Milky-Way like objects), we ﬁnd:
<g-r>=0.79±0.02 and <r-i>=0.38±0.01 and the following number
densities: 25±6% in the cluster core region, 37±7% in the outskirt
of the cluster, 16±5% in the two main groups and 22±6% in the
ﬁlaments. In other words, L⋆ galaxies are much redder than UDGs
and also they are distributed very diﬀerently. The similar color and
spatial distribution of UDGs with dwarf galaxies and their discrep-
ancy with more massive galaxies seems to favor an scenario where
UDGs are more likely bona ﬁde dwarfs than failed L⋆. We expand
about this idea in the Discussion section.

distance to their 5 closest neighbors < r5 > (see Fig. 10). Accord-
ing to that Figure, the colors of UDGs are rather independent of
their local density. We have repeated the same analysis done for the
structural parameters to quantify this statement (see Table 1). An-
other interesting aspect is that UDGs are signiﬁcantly bluer (∼0.3
mag in g-r and ∼0.2 in r-i) than the massive galaxies located in the
densest region of the large scale structure. The vast majority of the
UDGs have colors consistent with the dwarf galaxies in the large
scale structure at the cluster distance.

7 UDGS AND DWARF GALAXIES

The global distribution of the UDGs in the large scale structure
shown in Fig. 6 as well as the relationship between their color
and local density are suggestive of a scenario where UDGs are
not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, as a population, from dwarf galaxies
with stellar masses 109 M⊙. In fact, we have explored whether

4 Ideally, we would like to perform this analysis with dwarf galaxies with
lower masses, i.e. closer to the UDGs ones, however, the very scarce number
of spectroscopic objects with such low mass prevent us from conducting this
task. For this reason, we have made the compromise of exploring the spatial
distribution of 109 M⊙ dwarfs.

8 DISCUSSION

Within the standard galaxy formation scheme, very diﬀuse galax-
ies are expected to form in low initial density ﬂuctuations
(Fall & Efstathiou 1980; Mo et al. 1998) having blue colors, a large
amount of gas and disk-like shapes (McGaugh & Bothun 1994).
Moreover, these objects are not supposed to exist in high-density
environments as the eﬀect of tides will easily disrupted them
(Dekel & Silk 1986; Rosenbaum et al. 2009; Galaz et al. 2011).
However, UDGs are numerous in clusters, and the more mas-
sive the cluster the more abundantly they can be found (e.g.
van der Burg et al. 2016). There are two possible scenarios to ex-
plain these ﬁndings:

• First scenario. UDGs are a population connected to cluster en-
vironment and they are born and survive in these dense regions
since they are embedded in very massive (Milky-Way like) dark
matter halos. Only in the very inner regions of the clusters they will
be disrupted due to tidal eﬀects. They should be common, however,
in the outer regions of clusters.

• Second scenario. UDGs are regular dwarf galaxies that have
been formed in the lowest density regions of the large scale struc-
ture. They have dark matter halos typical of dwarf galaxies. That
means that, if they are accreted to clusters and/or groups central
regions, they can survive within them but farther away from the
densest regions compared to the scenario one. Once they reach the
peripherical regions of the densest structures, unless they have a
radial orbit towards the central regions, they can survive for long
time in the outer parts as they are weakly inﬂuenced by dynamical
friction (Smith et al. 2010, 2015).

Let’s explore whether the current observational evidences sup-
port any of the above scenarios. The strongest observational evi-
dence disfavoring that UDGs are failed L⋆ galaxies is the one by
Beasley et al. (2016). These authors ﬁnd that VCC1287, an UDG
in the Virgo Cluster, has a dark matter halo of ∼8×1010 M⊙. This
is more than a factor of 10 smaller than the ones expected for L⋆
galaxies (& 1012 M⊙). However, this result is just based on one sin-
gle galaxy and VCC1287 is a particularly low mass (∼3×107 M⊙)
UDG (i.e. a factor of ∼3 less massive than most of the UDG pop-
ulation explored so far ∼108 M⊙). Assuming that in this range of
masses, Mhalo will scale proportionality to M⋆, the Beasley et al.
(2016) result will still disfavor the idea that UDGs with M⋆∼108
M⊙ are failed L⋆. This is because the mass of its dark matter halo
would be yet oﬀ by a factor of 3. It is clear then that we need ur-
gently to estimate the dark matter masses of more UDGs. In the
meantime, we can evaluate the outcomes of the other observational
results.

A good test to support or disfavor any of the above scenarios
is to explore the spatial distribution of UDGs. This test is based on
the following two assumptions: a) the sizes of galaxies are a direct
manifestation of the spin parameter of its halo (Mo et al. 1998) and
b) the spin distribution is not strongly dependent on environment
(Amorisco & Loeb 2016). From assumption number one it follows
that UDGs can be either regular dwarfs with high-spin halos or L⋆
with average spin halos. From assumption number two, the spa-
tial distribution of UDGs will resemble the ones of the dark matter
haloes where they are embedded. Consequently, we have explored
in this paper which spatial distribution UDGs resemble most: L⋆
galaxies or the ones by regular dwarfs? In previous sections, we
have shown that UDGs share the same spatial distributions and col-
ors than regular dwarf galaxies with stellar mass 109 M⊙, while
they disagree with the distribution of more massive (L⋆ like) ob-

jects. Consequently, this could suggest that we can make the as-
sociation that UDGs are more likely dwarf galaxies than failed L⋆
objects.

Following a similar argument, Amorisco & Loeb (2016) make
the prediction: ”Under the assumption that the spin distribution is
not strongly dependent on environment and that these extended
disks are capable of forming stars in a similar way when in isola-
tion, our model suggests that an abundant tail of extended galaxies
should be ubiquitous in both clusters and in the ﬁeld”. This is in fact
what we see in this paper: UDGs are not a phenomenon exclusively
linked to clusters of galaxies. Note that previously reported UDGs
(with the exception of DGSAT I by Martinez-Delgado et al. 2016)
have been found in dense (i.e. cluster environments). However, we
ﬁnd UDGs are very common outside the clusters, in the large scale
ﬁlamentary structure that surround them (∼40%).

Both UDGs and L⋆ galaxies are found with the same propor-
tion (∼35%) in the outskirts of the Abell Cluster 168. However,
they strongly diﬀer in the inner core region of the cluster (25% L⋆
vs 7% UDGs) as well as in the ﬁlamentary structure (22% L⋆ vs
39% UDGs). This again supports the idea that UDGs are not failed
L⋆ galaxies as they are scarce in the regions where the tides are
strong on these objects. If they were sharing the same type of dark
matter halos they should better withstand the harsh conditions of
the cluster’s core.

A ﬁnal question we want to address is the following: Do we
have any evidence favoring the formation of UDGs outside clusters
and being later on accreted to the cluster periphery? If this were the
case, this would be another hint that the second proposed scenario
is more likely than the ﬁrst one. Clusters of galaxies are very active
locations within the large scale structure of the Universe, with sig-
niﬁcant continuous accretion of other galaxies by infall of minor
substructures happening with high frequency (e.g. Fakhouri et al.
2010). For this reason, UDGs formed outside Abell 168 have to in-
fall to the cluster sometime. This being the case, both the structural
and color properties of UDGs should reﬂect a gradual change in
their values as we approach to the densest regions. Yozin & Bekki
(2015) suggest that UDGs undergoing tidal ﬁelds should show a
decrease on their stellar mass, a ﬂattening of their structure (i.e. a
decrease of their axis ratio) and a decline in their surface bright-
ness. According to Fig. 9 and Table 1 there are a lower stellar mass
(by a factor of ∼1.5), a marginal fainter average surface brightness
(∼0.2 mag), a larger S´ersic index n (a factor of ∼1.25) and a lower
axis ratio (by a factor of ∼1.13) of the UDGs located in the densest
regions compared to the galaxies in most isolated places. Similarly,
Amorisco & Loeb (2016) predicts: ”It can be expected that the iso-
lated counterparts of cluster UDGs should have more clearly disky
morphologies, and not appear as red and quenched”. In this work,
we do not ﬁnd any clear hint neither in color nor in axis ratio to
support this conclusion5. Summarizing, while the structural prop-
erties of our galaxies show a qualitative agreement with the ideas of
UDGs transformation at infalling into the cluster environment, we
do not ﬁnd any obvious relation between the color of the UDGs as
a function their local density. In particular, there is not an obvious
trend towards redder colors (i.e. older ages) in the central region of
both the cluster and the largest groups. Nonetheless, the scatter in

5 It is worth noting that our selection criteria for selecting UDGs could
be biased against disk-like galaxies for two reasons: it is based on circular
Re (i.e. it avoids selecting the most inclined galaxies) and it is based on
central surface brightness (again that means that inclined projections are
disfavored).

colors shown in Fig. 10 is large as the result of the very faint surface
brightness distribution of these objects. A larger number of clusters
and deeper photometry than the one produced by Stripe82 would
be required to address in more detail this important question.

9 SUMMARY

In this paper we have explored the properties of UDGs inhabiting
the Abell Cluster 168 (z=0.045) and its rich surrounding large scale
structure. This work represents an important step forward to under-
standing in which environments UDGs are born and it allows us
to address in more detail the ultimate nature of the UDGs: regu-
lar dwarf galaxies inhabiting high-spin halos or failed L⋆ galaxies?
The main conclusions of this observational work can be summa-
rized as follows:

• UDGs are found over the whole scale structure. They are
distributed as follows: 7±3% in the cluster’s core and 19±5% in
groups. We have 35±7% in the outskirts of the clusters and 39±7%
in the ﬁlaments. The number densities of UDGs in each of the sub-
structures are: 6±3 Mpc−2 in the cluster core, 2.2±0.4 Mpc−2 in the
cluster outskirts, 2.2±0.5 Mpc−2 in the main groups surrounding
the cluster and 0.6±0.1 Mpc−2 in the ﬁlaments.

• Their spatial distribution is almost identical to the one found
for regular (∼109 M⊙) dwarf galaxies but signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from the ones of L⋆ objects. Under the assumption that the spin
distribution is not strongly dependent on the environment this can
be understood as favoring the idea that UDGs are dwarf galaxies
inhabiting high-spin halos.

• There is a gradual transformation of some of the structural
properties of UDGs with the local density where they are located.
From the lowest to the highest density we ﬁnd: their stellar mass
decrease by a factor of ∼1.5, their S´ersic index n increase by a fac-
tor of ∼1.25 and their axis ratio (b/a) decrease by a factor of ∼1.13.
This transformation is in qualitative agreement with the idea that
UDGs probably form outside the clusters and are later on accreted
through the infall of groups and ﬁlaments towards the cluster’s cen-
tral regions where they are ﬁnally destroyed by disruption.

• We do not ﬁnd a strong change in the colors of the UDGs
with the local density. UDGs colors (<(g-r)>=0.51±0.02 and <(r-
i)>=0.22±0.02) are compatible with the colors of dwarf galaxies.
These values can be interpreted as typical of ages between 2 to 6
Gyr depending on the assumed metallicity.

Figure A1. Size and apparent magnitude comparison between SExtractor
and IMFIT.

APPENDIX A: ROBUSTNESS OF THE STRUCTURAL
PARAMETERS

In this section we compare the structural properties, apparent mag-
nitude and eﬀective radius provided by IMFIT and SExtractor for
the whole set of galaxies in our ﬁeld. This comparison is done for
those objects that satisfy the SExtractor detection criteria and the
primordial color cut explained in Section 3. Our results are shown
in Fig. A1.

There is a very nice agreement in all the ﬁlters related to the
global apparent magnitude of the objects. At the magnitude limit
where most of the UDGs are (20.5<g<22.5 mag), the r.m.s. be-
tween SExtractor and IMFIT is around 0.1 mag. In relation to the
eﬀective radius along the semimajor axis, re, we ﬁnd that there is
a nice 1:1 relation for those galaxies larger than the typical seeing
of the Stripe82 data (∼1 arcsec). This is as expected, as SExtractor
does not take into account the seeing of the data when estimating
re. For this reason, their re is overestimated. The typical re of the
UDGs in our image is ∼2 arcsec. At these values, the r.m.s. in the
size estimation between both codes 10%.

In addition, we have checked the robustness of the structural
parameters for our UDGs comparing the sizes and S´ersic indeces
among the diﬀerent ﬁlters used. The result of this comparison is
shown in Fig. A2. We do ﬁnd a nice agreement between these struc-
tural parameters independently of the ﬁlter used. As expected the
eﬀective radius along the semimajor axis re is estimated more pre-
cisely than the S´ersic index.

Figure A2. Robustness of the structural parameters re and n obtained with
IMFIT for the set of UDGs explored in this work. The size and shape of the
UDGs are compared between the diﬀerent ﬁlters: g, r and i.

Table B1: Position and structural properties of the selected UDG candidates in
the area surrounding Abell Cluster 168. The structural parameters were derived
using IMFIT (Erwin 2015). The central surface brightness has been derived using
the circularized eﬀective radius Re. In the table, the eﬀective radius provided re
is the value along the semimajor axis.
