Vector meson production in ultra-peripheral pA and AA collisions at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) are very sensitive to Parton Distribution Functions (PDF) as well as to their leading-
order, next-to-leading-order, and medium corrections. This process is a complimentary tool to
explore the eﬀects of diﬀerent PDFs in particle production in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus
central collisions. Existing and forthcoming data available, e.g., from ALICE and CMS, may be
√
used in conjunction with our theoretical predictions to constrain the PDFs. We make predictions for
sN N = 2.76 TeV
rapidity distributions and for cross sections of J/ψ , ψ(2S) and Υ production at
sN N = 5 TeV. We use the second energy as representative for the Run 2 of PbPb collisions
and
at the LHC.

INTRODUCTION

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has made
seminal contributions to particle, nuclear and atomic
physics, contributing with numerous scientiﬁc discover-
ies and tests of fundamental theoretical predictions in the
physical sciences (see, e.g., Refs.
[1, 2]). Proton-proton
(pp) proton-nucleus (pA) and nucleus-nucleus (AA) col-
lisions produced in heavy ion accelerators such as the
GSI facility in Germany, the RHIC facility in the U.S.
and at the LHC in Switzerland have been looking for
particles predicted by the standard model (SM) [3–5],
as well as new particles, beyond the SM, such as su-
persymmetric particles [6–8], and for extra-dimensions
[9–12]. AA collisions have also been used to probe a
phase-transition of nuclear matter, from a hadronic to
a quark-gluon phase [13–15]. For example, charmonium
states, such as the J/ψ particles, are commonly used as
probes of the strongly interacting matter occurring in
relativistic heavy ion collisions. Due to their small size
(< 1 fm) and relatively large binding energy (hundreds
of MeV) they are considered ideal probes of the phase
transtion to a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The produc-
tion of charmonium states has been predicted [16] to
be suppressed and is considered a good signature of the
QGP. This has indeed been observed at the RHIC accel-
erator at Brookhaven, and at the CERN SPS and LHC
[17–23].

Hadron accelerators at CERN and elsewhere have also
been used for studies of photo-nuclear and photon-photon
physics induced in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions
(UPC), i.e., relativistic collisions without nuclear con-
tact [24]. It has long been realized that the strong elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds produced during a short time in such
accelerators can used to probe new phenomena in atomic,
nuclear and particle physics [25]. For example, the dou-
ble giant dipole resonance (DGDR), a giant resonance
(GR) excited on top of another GR was produced at the

GSI facility in 1993 by means of UPCs with heavy ions
[26, 27]. In 1996, the ﬁrst production of anti-hydrogen
atoms in the laboratory was carried out using UPCs in
CERN [28], followed by another experiment in Fermi-
lab [29]. More recently, UPCs have been used to study
gluon distributions in nuclei via the production of vector
mesons, such as J/ψ production in recent experiments at
the LHC [30–54]. This opened another opportunity to
study the manifestation of sub-nucleon degrees of free-
dom not only in dense QGP matter, but also in inter-
actions of quasi-real photons with partonic distributions
within the nuclei. Such studies are complementary and
greatly enhance our understanding of the strong interac-
tion and of QCD in general.

The basic idea of UPCs is that the strong electromag-
netic ﬁelds of a relativistic heavy ion due to the Lorentz
contraction give rise to hard (high energy) photons that
will further react with the proton or nucleus moving in
the opposite direction in the collider. Such peripheral
collisions give rise to numerous physical phenomena of
interest for nuclear and particle physics such as the study
of radiative meson widths, photo-production of exotic
mesons, and ultimately the tests of parton distribution
functions. Many theoretical publications on UPCs have
appeared in the last two decades, followed by a good
number of experiments at the GSI, RHIC and the LHC.
An incomplete list of related works is listed in Refs. [24–
57]

A recent study [58] has shown that the experimen-
tal data on J/ψ production in ultraperipheral collisions
at the LHC cannot be reproduced by means of produc-
tion, rescattering, and destruction of J/ψ’s with hadrons
alone, without the account of subnucleonic degrees of
freedom. UPC data are good probes of PDFs at small
momentum fraction x and momentum transfers Q2 up to
a few GeV2 for J/ψ production and up to a few tens of
GeV2 for Υ production. In this article we explore the de-
tails of the rapidity distributions and total cross sections

for J/ψ, ψ(2S) and Υ production at the LHC using sub-
nucleonic degres of freedom as with some of the previous
published works, e.g., Refs.
[30, 33, 34]. Our goal is to
test how several PDFs fare against experimental veriﬁca-
tion. In this work we have extended the study performed
in Refs. [33, 34, 59] to account for tests of parton distri-
bution functions at the LHC, also including other PDFs
and making predictions for the J/ψ, Υ(1s), and ψ(2S).
In section 2 we make a short review of the reaction
mechanism adopted for the description of particle pro-
duction in UPCs. In section 3 we summarize the main
physics in each of the PDFs adopted in this work.
In
section 4 we present our experimental results, comparing
them with the few existing experimental data and mak-
ing predictions for future experiments. Our conclusions
are spelled out in section 5.

REACTION MECHANISM

Peripheral heavy ion collisions have been reviewed in
previous publications [25, 55, 56]. In particular, the ap-
propriate reaction mechanism to use in UPC as a probe
of gluon distribution functions has been described in Ref.
[30] and used as a standard method in other publications
(e.g., see Refs.
[33, 34]). Here we summarize the main
equations that have been used in our calculations with
some small modiﬁcations from previous works.

The cross section for the production of a vector meson
V in UPC between heavy ions (AA collisions) is given by

σAA→V = 2

σγA→V (ω) ,

(1)

where ω is the (virtual) photon energy, σγA→V (ω) is the
photoproduction cross section and N (ω) are the virtual
photon numbers [25]. The factor of 2 accounts for the
production of mesons in the target and in the projectile,
which are equal in magnitude. At a given collision impact
parameter b the virtual photon ﬂux is given by (we use

with ξ = ωb/γ, where Z is the nuclear charge, γ is the
Lorentz contraction factor, and K0 and K1 are modiﬁed
Bessel functions. The exponential factor accounts for the
probability that both ions survive in the collision, with
the proﬁle function T (b) given by

Bessel function. For pA → V processes one just replaces
[ ˜ρA(q)]2 −→ ˜ρp(q) ˜ρA(q) in Eq. (3), where ˜ρp(q) now is
the proton form factor.

The virtual photon numbers entering Eq. 1 are ob-
tained by the integral of n(ω, b) over all impact parame-
ters, also accounting for photon polarization eﬀects (for
more details, see Refs. [60, 61]),

where CA is the cross sectional area of the nucleus which
can be obtained from its matter density distribution as a
function of the intrinsic coordinate, ρA(r). In this equa-
tion we have introduced a modiﬁcation of the method
used in Refs. [60, 61] which treats nuclei as hard spheres,
and we introduce a proper description of the matter dif-
fusiveness in the nucleus. This is important because the
most eﬀective collisions for vector meson production oc-
cur when the nuclei ﬂy by very close to each other, i.e.,
in “grazing” collisions. In our method there is no need to
introduce a cutoﬀ impact parameter. The meson is ex-
pected to be produced with transverse polarization due
to helicity conservation of a quasi-real photon [60, 61].
For the rapidity distributions, dσA(p)A→V /dy, we use
the formalism of Refs.
[30, 33], so that the kinematical
relation dσ/dy = ωdσ/dω is used and the corresponding
distributions become

dσpA→V

dy

N A(ω)σγp→V (ω)

where ωl (ωl ∝ e−y) and ωr (ωr ∝ ey) denote photons
arising from A and from p, respectively, with nuclei as-
sumed to come from the left and protons from the right
of the observer. This equation takes care of the asymme-
try in the number of photons incident on the proton and
on the nucleus, respectively. For AA collisions,

and the rapidity distributions are obviously symmetric
about mid-rapidity, y = 0 because the left and right
photon ﬂuxes are identical and the second term in this
equation yields a mirror image distribution of the ﬁrst
term as a function of the photon energy in the labora-
tory, ω. The rapidity y is is given by y = ln(2ω/MV ) =
ln(W 2
γp/2γLmN MV ), where mN is the nucleon mass,
sγp is the invariant c.m. energy of the photon-
Wγp =
proton system, and γL is the laboratory Lorentz factor
of the nucleus.

√

In Fock space, the UPC produced photon can ﬂuctuate
leading to the interaction of either bare photons with
the nucleus or of a partonic component of the photon
with the nucleus [62–64]. Thus, the cross section for the
production of a vector meson in UPC entering Eq. (1)
can be written as the sum of resolved and unresolved
photon ﬂuctuations, i.e.,

σγA→V (ω) = σγA→V

unres (ω) + σγA→V

res

(ω).

(7)

To calculate the resolved photoproduction cross section
one needs the partonic distributions of light quarks and
gluons in the photons, and in the nuclei as well [65]. A
detailed study of the contribution of resolved photons for
the production of free q ¯q-pairs in UPCs was done in Refs.
[34, 65]. Although the resolved component is a higher-
order process, it was shown in Ref.
[34] that the con-
tributions of the resolved photon are not negligible, e.g.,
at the level of about 10% for the production of c¯c pairs
and 20% for b¯b pairs. However, the resolved component
contribution to the production of bound states in UPCs
is negligible and therefore we will only consider here the
contributions of “bare” unresolved photons interacting
with gluon distributions in the nuclei via photon-gluon
fusion.

According to Refs. [66–71] the cross sections for photo-
production of vector mesons to lowest-order is given by

where, α is the ﬁne-structure constant, MV is the vec-

γp is the momentum frac-
tion carried by the gluons (Bjorken variable), gp(x, Q2) is
the proton gluon distribution at the momentum transfer
¯Q2 = (MV /2)2, Γee is the meson leptonic decay width,
and αs( ¯Q2) is the strong coupling constant calculated at
the average momentum transfer ¯Q2. The relation be-
tween the Bjorken x variable and rapidity is given by
x = (MV /2ωL)e−y, where ωL is the photon energy in
the laboratory reference frame.

The function RA(x, Q2) accounts for the nuclear
medium eﬀects on the modiﬁcation of the gluon distri-
bution. For nuclei, the integral in the last term includes
the integration over the momentum transfer of the nu-
clear form factor F (t) with the minimum momentum
transfer given by tmin = (M 2
V /4ωγL)2, appropriate for
narrow resonances. For photo-production on protons, we
use the second option in Eq. (8) with b = 4.5 GeV−2 be-
ing the slope parameter of the proton form factor. The
formalism described in this paragraph is reminiscent of
that introduced in Ref.
[30], with the assumption that
the forward scattering amplitude determines the photo-
production by means of the optical theorem, whereas the
elastic momentum transfer is determined by the nucleus

spatial matter distribution. The photoproduction of vec-
tor mesons in UPCs depends signiﬁcantly more on the
medium eﬀects for PbPb collisions than for pPb colli-
sions. We thus focus our study on PbPb collisions which
have been studied experimentally at the LHC at the en-
sN N = 5 TeV. We notice
ergies
that the energy 2.76 TeV is the equivalent to the 7 TeV
run for pp but with PbPb collisions at the LHC. The 5
TeV run is the pPb run for a proton beam energy of 8
TeV. These are both Run 1 at the LHC. The equivalent
PbPb runs for Run 2 are: (a) for 13 TeV the pp collisions
occur at 5.125 TeV and the 14 TeV pp collisions equiva-
sN N = 5 TeV as
lent occurs at 5.52 TeV. Here we use
representative of PbPb collisions for Run 2 at the LHC.

PARTON DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS AND

MEDIUM CORRECTIONS

The PDFs we use in our calculations are scale depen-
dent functions of momentum fraction for partonic degree
of freedom in the initial state hadron. The spin direction
of the quarks is not considered separately and the PDFs
quantify the probability densities for ﬁnding a parton
with momentum fraction x (Bjorken variable) at a mo-
mentum transfer Q2 in the hadron (here, the proton or
nucleus). Usually, these densities increase with increas-
ing Q2 at low x and decrease with Q2 at high x. For a
ﬁxed low value of Q2 the valence quarks are dominant
in the nucleon, whereas at large Q2 values, the q ¯q-pairs
(sea quarks) increase with a low momentum fraction x.
These quarks and anti-quarks are responsible for only
about half of the nucleon momentum, with the other half
of its momentum being carried by the gluons. The gluon
PDF also increases with increasing Q2 and is the most
relevant part in our calculations (for a review, see, e.g.,
Ref. [72]).

Parton Distribution Functions result from the applica-
tion of an appropriate factorization theorem [73]. Fac-
torization separates the long distance low-scale interac-
tions from the short-distance interaction. The latter can
be calculated in perturbative Quantum Chromodynam-
ics (pQCD) using the property of asymptotic freedom
[74, 75]. At high Q2, the strong interaction coupling
αS(Q2) (cid:28) 1 and the interaction can be written as an
expansion in this parameter with the leading order (LO)
term proportional to αS, the next-to-leading (NLO) term
proportional to α2
S, and so on. This approach, however,
fails to describe the low Q2 dynamics where αS(Q2) ∼ 1.
The low-scale interactions are non-perturbative ob-
jects and cannot be predicted with current techniques.
Rather, the PDFs are obtained from phenomenological
ﬁts to abundant experimental data, mostly Deep Inelas-
tic Scattering (DIS) of leptons on nucleons and nuclei.
Typical work in this direction has been published in sev-

improved the determination of gluon distributions, but
large uncertainties at both low and high x are still found
in the context of medium corrections and nuclear mass
dependence [90–92]. The UPC data from the LHC shows
that theoretical calculations using LO and NLO correc-
tions in the PDFs can provide useful constraints on the
small-x dependence of gA(x, Q2) [33, 34, 59].

Several PDFs have been used as input in theoretical
calculations of meson production in UPCs. For example,
in Ref.
[30] relatively old versions of the PDFs from
[62, 85, 93–96] were used. It was shown that the
Refs.
photo-nuclear vector meson cross sections using the EKS
[85] parametrization are about 1.25 larger than that with
the AG [96] parametrization, while the GRV [94] yields
a factor 2.4 larger than the EKS prediction. A similar
tendency was found for vector meson production and c¯c
pairs in UPCs in lead-lead collisions at the LHC. Medium
eﬀects through the inclusion of the function RA(x, Q2) in
Eq. (8) were found to be relevant. The same formalism
elaborated in Ref. [30] was later adopted in Ref. [31] to
study color transparency eﬀects in the production of J/ψ
mesons in UPCs. Their calculations yield a bump-shape
rapidity distribution with a suppression at mid-rapidity
by a factor of about 6 due to the color transparency eﬀect
[31].

The medium eﬀects included in RA(x, Q2) are usually
separated into a few regimes: (a) for x < 0.04, it is de-
noted shadowing, because the nuclear PDFs are smaller
than the corresponding distributions for free protons,
meaning that RA < 1; (b) antishadowing, occurs as an
enhancement (RA > 1) in the range 0.04 < x < 0.3;
(c) the EMC eﬀect occurs in the region 0.3 < x < 0.8
with a depletion of the nuclear PDF; and ﬁnally (d) for
x > 0.8 one has the region of Fermi motion with an-
other enhancement of the nuclear PDFs [84, 97–99]. The
medium modiﬁcation of the gluon distributions in Pb, us-
ing RA(x, Q2 = M 2
J/ψ/4), from the EPS08, EPS09, and
HKN07 cases is shown in Figure 1 of Ref. [34], which will
be used for the interpretation of some of our numerical
results.

A renewed interest on using UPCs to test PDFs
surged with new experimental interest at the LHC. In
Ref. [33] an investigation of the medium eﬀects encoded
in RA(x, Q2) was published using the MSTW08 [79],
EPS08, EPS09 [90, 91] and HKN07 [89] PDFs. The par-
ton distributions from Ref. [79] (MSTW08) have the ad-
vantage of including free nucleon PDFs to which nuclear
modiﬁcations have been included, but they also contain
separately nuclear PDFs.
[34, 59] these PDFs
were studied further with RA(x, Q2) calculated at the
factorization scale Q2 = (MJ/ψ/2)2, used in the elastic
photoproduction cross sections for the J/ψ meson. For
MSTW08 no nuclear eﬀects (RA = 1) are assumed ini-
tially, while in HKN07 a weak gluon shadowing prevails
with no antishadowing and EMC eﬀects, but with Fermi
motion included. EPS09 has a rather strong shadow-

and Tevatron colliders.

The largest amount of data used to extract PDFs
comes from deeply inelastic scattering (DIS), Drell-Yan,
and direct jet production processes. Gluons, being elec-
trically neutral, are not directly probed in DIS and their
distributions are inferred from the momentum sum rules
and the QCD evolution of the PDFs. In the case of nu-
clei, there are much fewer data than for the free pro-
ton, which makes it interesting to deduce medium eﬀects
in nuclei and their dependence on their masses. Since
this mass dependence is not well known, medium cor-
rections published in the literature tend to vary wildly,
and eﬀects such as shadowing and antishadowing diﬀer
signiﬁcantly in magnitude [84–89]. These diﬀerences in
medium corrections are particularly visible at low Q2.
The ﬁrst global ﬁts adopted mainly DIS and DY lepton
pair production and only later other hadronic processes
such as particle production in nucleus-nucleus collisions
have been included. These global ﬁts have obviously

ter, with ρ0 being the central density, normalized so that

the nuclear surface diﬀuseness is given by a. For 208Pb
the parameters R = 1.2A1/3 fm, and a = 0.549 fm repro-
duce quite well the experimental data of electron-nucleus

√

√

sN N = 2.76 TeV and

We now discuss the rapidity distributions for J/ψ pro-
duction at
sN N = 5 TeV with
PDFs including medium corrections for Pb + Pb col-
lisions. The J/ψ is the ﬁrst excited state of c¯c bound
states, usually called “charmonium”. It has the second-
smallest rest mass of the charmonia, J P C = 1−−, a life-
time of 7.2 × 10−21 s, and a leptonic decay width of
Γee = 5.55 keV [101]. For the parton distributions we
use the CJ12 [103], CT14 [104], and the nCTEQ15 [102]
releases. The last one already accounts for medium cor-
rections and will be treated without the addition of alter-
native modiﬁcations. The CJ12 distribution will be mod-
iﬁed with medium corrections, RA(x, Q2), as deﬁned in
Eq. (8). These corrections include the nDS [86], HKN07
[89] and EPS08, EPS09 [90, 91]. For the last case, we use
in fact only the updated version, i.e., EPS09, except in
one case of illustrative value (bottom panel of Figure 2).
Initially, we do not include medium corrections for the
√
CJ12 [103], and CT14 [104] releases. Our results for
sN N = 2.76 TeV are shown in the upper panel of Figure
1. For the MSTW08 [79] we use the leading order (LO)
and include Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO) corrections in
the meson photo-production cross section through a phe-
nomenological multiplicative factor ζV = 1/3.5. As ex-
plained in Ref. [33], this factor is found by adjusting the
meson photoproduction data on protons calculated the-
oretically, σγp→V , with experimental data from HERA.
The excellent agreement with the experimental data is
attested in Figure 2 of Ref.
[33]. Additional details on
the origins of this higher-order correction factor are given
in Ref.
[33]. The dependence of the cross section on
the square of the gluon distribution implies that exclu-
sive vector meson production is a highly sensitive probe
of gluon modiﬁcations in nuclei. Higher order correc-
tions tend to decrease the rapidity distributions at mid-
rapidity. The UPC photo-production cross section for
the MSTW08LO distribution far exceeds the others and
is multiplied by a factor 1/3 to better facilitate visual-
ization in Figure 1. It is also narrower than the photo-
production cross sections obtained with the other PDFs.
The CJ12 distribution is also much smaller than for the
CT14 set. At this point, we were not able to include the

fect. But medium eﬀects are strongest in EPS08. These
ﬁndings have been conﬁrmed by means of our newest
calculations presented in this paper. We have introduced
some modiﬁcations in the way one calculates the number
of equivalent photons and also included additional PDFs
which can be used as predictions of the higher energy
runs at the LHC.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

√

The results of our calculations for vector meson pro-
duction of J/ψ(1S) (MV = 3.096 GeV), Υ(1S) (MV =
9.46 GeV), and ψ(2S) (MV = 3.686 GeV) in UPCs will
now be discussed. We choose two energies available at
the LHC,
sN N = 2.76 and 5 TeV. As mentioned ear-
lier, the second energy will be used as representative of
the Run 2 for PbPb collisions at the LHC. We start our
reporting with J/ψ production, for which experimental
data is available [37–41].
In later sections we will re-
port similar calculations for the corresponding cases of
the other two mesons. While ψ(2S) is also a charmo-
nium state, Υ(1S) is a b¯b bound state.

included in Run 2 at the LHC. This is relevant for pre-
dictive purposes. Two obvious outcomes are observed:
(a) the increase in the total cross sections, and (b) the
wider rapidity distributions. The virtual photon spec-
trum now contains photons with higher energies, leading
to a larger probability for the production of the J/ψ.
They are also more abundantly produced closer to the
beam rapidities and ﬂatten out at mid-rapidity. At mid-
rapidities (y = 0), the contribution from gluon shadowing
is largest and it decreases so that around y = 3 it is over-
taken by anti-shadowing eﬀects. At even higher rapidities
y > 5 anti-shadowing also loses its importance and the
distribution is dominated by EMC and Fermi motion ef-
fects. This correlation between the rapidity distribution
and the gluon distribution eﬀects in the momentum frac-
tion space x was also reported in Ref. [33]. The regions
of inﬂuence of shadowing and anti-shadowing eﬀects are
highlighted in the upper part of Figure 1.
It becomes
evident that this process is an excellent probe of shadow-
ing eﬀects in the gluon distribution functions. Since the
process depends quadratically on the gluon distributions
the rapidity distributions and total J/ψ production cross
sections is strongly suppressed by shadowing eﬀects even
for the weak shadowing present in the HKN07 case.

In Figure 2 we show our results for the rapidity dis-
√
tributions of J/ψ production in UPCs at the LHC for
sN N = 2.76 TeV using the EPS09, nDS and HKN07
medium corrections on the CT14 distributions. Also
shown are the results using the newest nCTEQ15 dis-
tributions. Here our calculations have been modiﬁed so
that the upper ﬁgure displays only the coherent part J/ψ
production in UPCs at the LHC using the MSTW08 par-
ton distribution function. The data are from Ref.
[38].
In this case, and only for the MSTW08 set, we have
constrained our calculation to coherent photoproduction,
i.e., when the photon acts on the whole nucleus. This ef-
fectively modiﬁes the integrals in Eqs. (1-8) to J/ψ by
contributions satisfying the condition that transverse mo-
menta be of the order of a few hundreds of MeV/c. With
such a restriction, the photon does not lead to nuclear
breakup when the J/ψ is produced. For larger trans-
verse momenta the photon couples to a single nucleon
and nuclear breakup can occur. The separation between
coherent and incoherent photoproduction is introduced
here in order to compare to the experiments which have
been set to avoid incoherent photoproduction, character-
ized by large transverse momentum transfers [38].

The deﬁnition of coherent and incoherent collisions
adopted in Ref. [38] assumes that the limiting transverse
momentum is pT < 200 MeV/c for coherent process and
pT > 200 MeV/c for incoherent processes, based in detec-
tion cuts introduced in the J/ψ → µ+µ− decay channel.
In in the J/ψ → e+e− decay channel, experimentalists
have adopted the limiting value of pT < 300 MeV/c and
pT > 300 MeV/c, respectively. For more details, see Ref.
[38]. Theoretically, the separation of coherent and in-

eﬀects of errors in the PDFs on the photo-production
cross sections, which might help us understand the ori-
gins of these diﬀerences. Also, the MSTW08LO distribu-
tion is used as our standard set for the free proton PDF
while the CT14 set is taken as our standard of the higher-
order corrections in the nuclear parton distributions. The
large spread of the results of the values of the rapidity
distributions and total cross sections is due to a lack of
data in the low-x region producing large uncertainties in
the parton distributions. Our results for the MSTW08
data set are somewhat diﬀerent than those reported in
Refs. [33, 34, 59] due to the diﬀerent treatment we have
introduced to calculate the virtual photon numbers.

The NLO corrections modify the results with the
MSTW08 distributions dramatically (by a factor of
1/3.5), but still do not bring it in line with the other
distributions which also include higher-order eﬀects. As
discussed in the previous section, free nucleon PDFs in-
clude valence and sea quarks which are probed by elec-
trons, e.g., in HERA. As is evident from Eq. (8), the
UPCs probe the gluon distribution component of the
PDFs through the gluon-fusion mechanism, which might
lead to free q ¯q-pairs and bound states in the form of vec-
tor mesons. It is thus expected that high-order correc-
tions, which include an increasing number of gluon-loop
diagrams, would have a more discriminative eﬀect of the
photon-gluon fusion mechanism in UPCs. An obvious
problem for interpretation of the calculations is that the
rapidity distributions are obtained by an integration over
the momentum fraction x and it is thus not so straight-
forward to judge the several modiﬁcations of the PDFs
in diﬀerent regions of the x space. We also note that the
factorization scale of MV /2 ∼ 1 GeV lies in the lower
bottom of all PDFs considered here, which have Q2 val-
ues running from this energy and up.

In the lower part of Figure 1 we show the results for

more eﬀectively using the intranuclear cascade model of
Ref.
[58] which allows for the determination of the full
four-momentum of the produced particle. Based on this
model, the rapidity distribution for coherent processes
using the MSTW08 distribution indicates that the form
of the rapidity distribution does not change appreciably,
except that their magnitude is eﬀectively reduced by a
factor of 0.5 [106]. Using this reduction factor in our
calculations, we get the solid curve in bottom panel of
Figure 2 for the MSTW08 distribution. The experimen-
tal data are well reproduced with the MSTW08 set with
the inclusion of the EPS09 medium corrections. At mid-
rapidity, the experimental data in Ref. [38] yields a com-
bined weighted average for the di-muon and di-electron
decay channels of dσcoherent/dy = 2.38+0.34−0.24 mb, whereas
our calculation yields 2.42 mb. Our results also agree
with those obtained in Refs.
[33, 34] for the same dis-
tribution set and medium corrections, if the reduction
factor of 0.5 is also applied to their calculations. Due
to a stronger gluon shadowing in the EPS08, it appre-
ciably underestimates the rapidity distribution and cross
sections by about a factor of two. The HKN07 and nDS
parametrizations seem to contain too little gluon shad-
owing. As mentioned in Ref. [38], PDF sets which do not
include gluon shadowing are incompatible with the mea-
sured results for J/ψ vector meson production in UPCs
at the LHC.

It is worthwhile mentioning at this point that, except
for the results presented in the bottom panel of Fig-
ure 2, all other results of our calculation are displayed
without the separation between coherent and incoherent
processes, i.e., both processes are weighted in with our
integrals running over all possible momenta. As a last
comment on the results presented in Figure 2 we notice
that, being wider than the MSTW08 distributions (also
evident in Figure 1), the CJ12 and CT14 would only
marginally reproduce the experimental data of [38] at
the rapidities y ∼ −3 and y ∼ 3.

√

In Figure 3 we show the rapidity distributions for J/ψ
sN N = 5 TeV
production in UPCs at the LHC with
using the EPS09, nDS and HKN07 medium corrections
on CT14 distributions. Also shown are the results using
nCTEQ15 distributions. We observe an increase in the
total cross sections, and wider rapidity distributions due
to the increase in the collision energy and the presence
of harder photons in the equivalent photon spectrum. In
contrast to the MSTW08 distributions all others PDFs
consistently yield similar widths for dσ/dy, as also ob-
served in Figures 1 and 2. However, they display diﬀerent
shadowing eﬀects, as emphasized by the spread of about
a factor of 2 of dσ/dy at mid-rapidities.

In Table I we present the cross sections for J/ψ pro-
duction in UPCs at the LHC for two laboratory energies
and several parton distributions. Results obtained with
medium corrections are included separately. We observe

sizable diﬀerences among the diﬀerent PDF sets. The ef-
fects of shadowing in the gluon distribution functions and
their contribution to the total photo-production cross
sections are the same as those discussed for the case of
the rapidity distributions. As shadowing eﬀects are re-
sponsible for reducing the rapidity distributions in the
range −3 < y < 3, where dσ/dy are largest, the total
cross sections are also aﬀected accordingly.

It is worthwhile at this point to discuss a severe prob-
lem with the determination of the most appropriate PDF
set to reproduce data from UPCs at the LHC. To make
this point explicit, we show in Figure 4 the longitudinal
momentum x times the PDF for the gluon with errors at
Q = MJ/ψ/2 for MSTW08 [79], CJ12 [103], CT14 [104],

the several PDF sets without taking into account the er-
rors in the individual sets. As we see in Figure 4, the

duction in UPCs at the LHC. Had we included these
errors, there would be a substantial overlap of the results
presented in Figures 1-3 and also in the following ﬁgures
for ψ(2S) and Υ production. In particular, it would be
hard to determine the best PDF set reproducing the data
from Ref. [38], as shown in Figure 2.

Besides the increase of the mass leading to a reduc-
tion of the magnitude of the cross sections, also due the
smaller magnitude of the leptonic decay width, Γee =
2.37 keV for the ψ(2S), there is an evident spread of
the cross sections for the diﬀerent parton distributions.
This can be seen in Table II where we present our cross
sections for ψ(2S) production in UPCs at the LHC for
two laboratory energies and several parton distributions.
Results obtained with medium corrections are included
separately. We observe some diﬀerences among the dif-
ferent PDF sets, but mainly in the magnitude of the cross
sections.

The variations of our results for the several PDFs and
medium corrections shown in Figures 5-7 and in Table II
are due to the sensitivity of the calculations on the meson
mass in the integration over the diﬀerent regions of the
parton momentum fraction x. As an example, the sen-
sitivity (or lack thereof) of the cross sections to medium
corrections can be inferred by using the free MSTW08
and the medium-corrected MSTW08+nDS. For the J/ψ
sN N = 5 TeV,
production at
the reduction due to shadowing eﬀects are 13% and 30%
respectively, while for ψ(2S) production the reductions
amount to 12% and 15%. Therefore, at least the total
cross sections seem to globally probe shadowing and anti-
shadowing eﬀects in a distinguishable way for J/ψ and
ψ(2S) at higher bombarding energies.

of the Υ has as the overall eﬀect of reducing the width
of the rapidity distributions with the contribution from
shadowing eﬀects being limited to −2 < y < 2. As we
noticed for ψ(2S) production, the impact of the larger
mass of the Υ modiﬁes the momentum fraction x content
probed by the square of the gluon distribution, through
the dσ/dy dependence on [xgA(x)]2, leading to a reduc-
tion of the shadowing eﬀects probed in the rapidity scale.
But, most importantly, the larger value of the ξ variable
in the virtual photon spectrum leads to a much larger
reduction of the cross sections. The relative size of σ
and dσ/dy obtained with each PDF vary appreciably for
the three mesons and also for diﬀerent energies. Thus, a
better scrutiny of parton distribution functions could be
achieved in future experiments by measuring UPCs.

tor mesons J/ψ, ψ(2S) and Υ(1S) in ultra-peripheral col-
lisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. We have

because the cross sections decrease by 3 orders of mag-
nitude to a much larger vector meson mass. But also
the rapidity distributions become much narrower in this
case.

The quadratic dependence of the elastic photoproduc-
tion on gluon distributions and their medium modiﬁca-
tions do allow for a serious probe for the diﬀerent parton
distribution functions. The discrimination of shadowing
eﬀects can manifest through cross sections diﬀering by
factors as large as 10 for the diﬀerent PDFs we have con-
sidered. We hope that the Run 2 of PbPb collisions at
the LHC will allow to better constrain medium modiﬁca-
tions of gluon distribution and the consequent magnitude
of shadowing eﬀects.

Theoretical models still lack the inclusion of ﬁnal state
breakup of vector mesons, which seems to be evidenced
in Ref. [38]. As claimed in Ref. [58], where cascade simu-
lations have been carried out, only a small fraction of the
produced J/ψ leave the nucleus, emphasizing the impor-
tance of ﬁnal state interactions in vector meson produc-
tion in UPCs. Such eﬀects would be better investigated
if additional nuclei could be used in the collider. It is also
worthwhile mentioning that the role of resolved photon
partonic distributions still demands additional theoreti-
cal work. Finally, the PDF sets display appreciable un-
certainties as a function of the momentum fraction x.
The experimental data on UPCs at the LHC for rapidity
distributions and total cross sections of vector meson pro-
duction introduces an additional tool to constrain PDF
distributions, although an assessment of the role of the
errors in the x-dependence of the PDFs deserves a better
scrutiny. Work in this direction is in progress.

mentary to those exploring PDFs to predict the outcome
of particle production in central collisions between rela-
tivistic heavy ion collisions. In this work we have only
considered direct photo-production in UPCs, although it
is known that the resolved photon components also play
a sizable role [34]. The EPS09 model, which includes a
coherent partonic energy loss, still seems to be the best
ﬁt to the experimentally available data on J/ψ produc-
tion [38]. We have also utilized a larger number of parton
distribution functions than have been considered so far,
such as the META, CT14, nDS and nCTEQ15 PDFs,
with or without medium corrections.

The total cross sections as well as the rapidity distri-
butions are appreciably sensitive to shadowing at mid-
rapidities and a rather insensitive to antishadowing at
very forward and very backward rapidities. Because of
their small diﬀerence in mass there are not many notice-
able diﬀerences in their sensitivity to gluon distributions
for the cross sections and rapidity distributions in J/ψ
and ψ(2S) production. But there is a drop of the cross
section by a factor of 3 or larger, due to the reduction
in the gluon PDF and the reduced number of virtual
photons for the larger vector meson mass. The situa-
tion changes dramatically for the case of Υ production
