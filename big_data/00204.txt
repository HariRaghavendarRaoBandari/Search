IGNACE ARISTIDE MINLEND

Abstract. Let (M, g) be a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension N ≥ 2. We
prove existence in (M, g) of a family (Ωε)ε∈(0,ε0) of self-Cheeger sets. The domains Ωε
are perturbations of geodesic balls of radius ε centered at p ∈ M, and in particular,
if p0 is a non-degenerate critical point of the scalar curvature of g, then the family
(∂Ωε)ε∈(0,ε0) constitutes a smooth foliation of a neighborhood of p0.

1. Introduction

Given a measurable set A in a compact Riemannian manifold (M, g), the perimeter

P (A) of A in M is deﬁned (see for instance [12]) by

P (A) := sup(cid:26)ZA

divg(ξ) dvg : ξ ∈ C 1(M), |ξ| ≤ 1(cid:27) ,

where dvg is the Riemannian volume element. We recall that if A is Lipschitz, P (A) is
the (N − 1)-dimensional Riemannian volume of ∂A.

Let Ω be an open set in (M, g) with smooth boundary. The Cheeger constant h(Ω)

of Ω is deﬁned by

h(Ω) := inf
A

P (A)
|A|

,

(1.1)

where the domain A varies over all measurable subsets of Ω with ﬁnite perimeter and
|A| is the N-dimensional Riemannian volume of A.

Any set F in Ω which realizes the inﬁmum (1.1) is called a Cheeger set in Ω.

If
Ω is a minimizer for (1.1), we say that Ω is self-Cheeger. If Ω is the only set which
attains h(Ω), we say that Ω is uniquely self-Cheeger. We refer the reader to [1] and [?]
for an introductory survey on the Cheeger problem and to [2] for the deﬁnition of the

Cheeger constant on a manifold. Some isoperimetric estimates are also given in [4]
and [8]. Cheeger constants appear in geometric problems, modeling of land slides and
in image processing, see [3] and [6]. The main result of this paper is the following.

Theorem 1.1. Any compact Riemannian manifold (M, g) of dimension N ≥ 2 admits
a family of uniquely self-Cheeger sets (Ωε)ε∈(0,ε0) with

h(Ωε) =

N
ε

for all

ε ∈ (0, ε0).

Moreover, if p0 is a non-degenerate critical point of the scalar curvature s of g, then
the family (∂Ωε)ε∈(0,ε0) constitutes a smooth foliation of a neighborhood of p0.

The result of Theorem 1.1 relies on the following theorem due to M.M. Fall and the

author in [5].

Theorem 1.2. Let (M, g) be a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension N ≥ 2.
There exists ε0 > 0 such that for all ε ∈ (0, ε0), there exist a smooth domain Ωε and a
function uε ∈ C 2(Ωε) such that

(1.2)

In particular if p0 is a non-degenerate critical point of the scalar curvature s of g, then
the family (∂Ωε)ε∈(0,ε0) constitutes a smooth foliation of a neighborhood of p0.

The domains Ωε in Theorem 1.2 are perturbations of geodesic balls Bg

at p with radius ε. Indeed, we have that Ωε = (1 + vp,ε)Bg
satisfying

ε (p), with vp,ε : ∂Bg

ε (p) centered
ε (p) → R

||vp,ε||C 2,α(∂Bg

ε (p)) ≤ cε2,

(1.3)

where the constant c is independent on ε.

From the result of Micheletti and Pistoia in [9], it is known that for a generic metric
on a manifold, all critical points of the scalar curvature are non-degenerate. The
result of Theorem 1.1 then implies that for a generic metric g′, a neighborhood of any
critical point of the scalar curvature can be foliated by a family (∂Ωε)ε∈(0,ε0), where
Ωε is uniquely self-Cheeger with Cheeger constant equal to N/ε. This can be seen
as the analogue of Ye’s result in [14], where he proved that around a non-degenerate
critical point of the scalar curvature function in a Riemannian manifold, there exists
a unique regular foliation by constant mean curvature spheres. We emphasize that
the enclosures of hypersurfaces constructed by Ye are not necessarily self-Cheeger sets.
Indeed, as we will show in Remark 2.1 (below), this is the case if the Ricci curvature
is negative semi-deﬁnite and the scalar curvature is negative at p. Here p can be a
non-degenarate critical point of the scalar curvature.

2. Proof of Theorem 1.1

To proof Theorem 1.1, we shall show that the domain Ωε in Theorem 1.2 is the

unique Cheeger set in itself.

Denote by rp(·) := distg(p, ·) the Riemannian geodesic distance function to p. We

recall that for all ε ∈ (0, ε0), the solution uε to (1.2) is given (see [5, Section 3]) by

uε(q) =

p(q)

ε2 − r2
2N

+ ε4wε(q)

for all

q ∈ Ωε,

(2.1)

where

||wε||C 2(M) ≤ c

and c is a positive constant independent on ε. We recall the Bochner’s formula (see
[13]): for all u ∈ C 3(M),

∆g|∇u|2

g = 2|Hessg(u)|2 + 2h∇u, ∇(∆gu)ig + 2Ricg(∇u, ∇u),

(2.2)

where Ricg is the Ricci curvature of g, Hessg(u) stands for the Hessian of u and we have
denoted |A|2 = tr(AAt) for a bilinear form A. By the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality,

We claim that

|Hessg(u)|2 ≥

|∇uε|g <

in Ωε.

(2.3)

(2.4)

Indeed, deﬁne for all q ∈ Ωε, the function Pε(q) := |∇uε(q)|2
there exists a positive constant C depending only on M such that

g. Since M is compact,

This together with (2.2), (2.3) and the fact that −∆guε = 1 in Ωε yield

Ricg(∇uε(q), ∇uε(q)) ≥ −C|∇uε(q)|2
g.

From (2.1) and using |∇rp(·)|g = 1, we get

|∇uε(q)|2

g ≤ cε2,

(2.5)

(2.6)

where c is a positive constant only depending on M. Finally (2.5) and (2.6) allow to
obtain

∆gPε ≥

in Ωε,

where C is a positive constant only depending on M. We then conclude that for ε
small enough, ∆gPε > 0 in Ωε. Thus Pε attains its maximum only on ∂Ωε by the strong
maximum principle. Since Pε ≡ ε2

N 2 on ∂Ωε by (1.2), the claim follows.

Let A ⊂ Ωε be a Lipschitz set. Then integrating (1.2) on A and applying the claim

together with the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, we get

|A| = −Z∂A

metric g. Integrating (1.2) on Ωε and using (2.7) gives

for all measurable subset A ⊂ Ωε with ﬁnite perimeter.

We conclude with the smoothness of Ωε that Ωε is self-Cheeger with Cheeger constant
equal to N/ε. To see that Ωε is uniquely Cheeger, we notice that if A is a Cheeger set
in Ωε with A 6= Ωε, then we have a strict inequality in (2.7) by (2.4) and hence

which is a contradiction. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Remark 2.1. In [10], Pacard and Xu generalized the result of Ye proving existence
of a family (S♭
p,ρ)ρ∈(0,ρ0) of CMC hypersurfaces in the case where the scalar curvature
has degenerate critical points. We note that Ye’s CMC hypersurfaces are of the form
pρ,ρ, where distg(p0, pρ) ≤ cρ2 for some non-degenerate critical point p0 of the scalar

S♭

p,ρ is not a self-Cheeger set if Ricg ≤ 0 and s < 0 at p.
Let us assume that B♭

p,ρ is a self-Cheeger set, then by Corollary 1.1 in [10] we ﬁnd

p,ρ is parameterized by

G(x) := expp(cid:18)ρ(1 − wp,ρ(x))x(cid:19),

x ∈ SN −1 ⊂ TpM.
