Local modes caused by defects play a signiﬁcant role in the thermal transport properties of
thermoelectrics. Of particular interest are charge-neutral defects that suppress thermal conductivity,
without signiﬁcantly reducing electrical transport. Here we report a temperature dependent Raman
study, that identiﬁes such a mode in a standard thermoelectric material, Bi2Te2Se. One of the
modes observed, whose origin has been debated for decades, was shown mostly likely to be an
antisite defect induced local mode. The anomalous temperature independent broadening of the
local mode is ascribed to the random arrangement of Se atoms. The temperature renormalization
of all modes are well explained by an anharmonic model–Klemens’s model.

The family of compounds, Bi2Te3−xSex have been
studied for decades as good thermoelectrics.[1] In binary
compounds like Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, the small defect for-
mation energies and band gaps often result in relatively
large carrier densities, leading the bulk conductance to
dominate over the surface conductance.[2] A transition
from p-type to n-type behavior in the Bi2Te3−xSex solid
solution was reported decades ago.[3, 4] Further stud-
ies have revealed that when x is close to 1, namely
Bi2Te2Se, the crystal structure is ordered.[2] The order-
ing was suggested to produce the dramatic reduction in
defect density.[5] However, surprisingly it has been known
that Bi2Te2Se contains a single extra mode, the origin
of which remains a mystery and was suspected to be a
local mode.[6] It is known that local modes play an im-
portant role in lowering the thermal conductivity of ma-
terials. Especially for thermoelectric clathrates[7] and
skutterudites,[8] intentionally induced local modes (rat-
tling modes) can cause the glassy behavior in phonon
transport, while producing little, if any eﬀect on the elec-
tronic properties namely phonon-glass electron-crystal.
Raman spectroscopy, owing to non-destructive to sam-
ples and quick access to phonon modes, has been widely
used for characterization of materials for decades. More-
over, combined with temperature dependence Raman
scattering can be used to probe phonon dynamics,[9–12]
as well as defects and defects induced local modes.[13–15]
While there have been many studies on Bi2Te3−xSex us-
ing Raman spectroscopy,[6, 16] a high spectral resolution
broad temperature range dependent study is still lacking.
In this paper, we present a Raman study of Bi2Te2Se
over the temperature range from 10 K to 290 K. Four
modes were observed in the whole temperature range.

Three of them are assigned as A1
g modes.[6]
The extra mode, the origin of which is controversial, is
shown most likely to be an antisite defects induced lo-
cal mode. The anomalous broadness of the local mode
is qualitatively understood through a simulation of di-
atomic chains. The temperature dependence of all four
phonon modes are well explained by anharmonic phonon-
phonon interactions.

The Bi2Te2Se single crystal was grown with special
techniques to suppress carrier-concentration. Detailed
growth procedure and characterizations are described in
previously published works.[2, 17, 18] As the preparation
for measurements, Bi2Te2Se sample was freshly cleaved
and quickly placed inside a sample chamber. The temper-
ature dependence was achieved via an automated closed-
cycle cryostation manufactured by Montana Instrument,
Inc. The Raman spectra were taken in a backscatter-
ing conﬁguration with a home-built Raman microscope.
A linear polarized 532nm solid state laser was used as
the excitation source. Two diﬀractive Notch Filters were
used to reject Rayleigh scattering. This also allows us to
observe both Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman shifts. The
laser spot size was 1 µm in diameter. The laser power
was kept as low as 40 µW to avoid laser-induced heat-
ing. This was checked at 10 K by monitoring the anti-
Stokes signal as the laser power was reduced. Once the
anti-Stokes signal disappeared, the power was cut an ad-
ditional 50%. More details about the instruments can
be found in elsewhere.[19–22]

Bi2Te2Se is of a quintuple layer structure TeI -Bi-SeII -
Bi-TeI (see FIG. 1a).[2] From group theory analysis, the
space group of Bi2Te2Se is R-3m (No.166). The point
group is D3d. There are four inequivalent irreducible rep-
resentations in the D3d point group. They are Ag, Eg,
Au and Eu respectively. Raman-active modes are 2Ag +
2Eg. As established in previous experiments, the lowest
energy mode in the Bi2Te3−xSex is typically below 50
cm−1 which is below our low energy cut-oﬀ.[23–25] As a

result, in our spectral range we expect to observe three
phonon peaks from the zone center modes in the Raman
spectra of Bi2Te2Se.

The spectra of Bi2Te2Se taken at 290 K and 10 K un-
der XX conﬁguration (collinear polarized) are shown in
FIG. 1b. We can see the Bi2Te2Se spectra consists of
two isolated peaks at lower frequencies, and two peaks at
higher energies which overlap. To quantitatively evaluate
the overlapped features, the Raman spectra of Bi2Te2Se
were ﬁtted with Four Voigt functions (more details about
Voigt function are given later). From the ﬁt, the frequen-
cies of the four features are: 65.12 cm−1, 109.1cm−1,
145.0 cm−1 and 154.6 cm−1 at 10 K, in good agreement
with those found by Akrap et al..[26] However, the line-
width in our spectra are much narrower, perhaps due to
the higher quality of our crystal. In FIG. 2, we also show
the Raman spectra of Bi2Te2Se under XY (crossed po-
larized) conﬁguration at room temperature.
It is clear
that all the modes except the one located at 109.1cm−1

vanish in XY conﬁguration which is consistent with the
literature[6]. The ﬁrst two modes plus the mode of high-
est energy have been assigned as A1
g modes
according to the literature.[6] However, there is no con-
sensus on the assignment of the mode at 145.0 cm−1,
which we denote as V1 for convenience. Akrap et al.
noted that a very weak mode seen in their IR conduc-
tivity spectra was very close to the V1 mode. From this
the authors concluded that the appearance of this mode
in Raman scattering is probably due to the activation of
A2u mode by disorder and symmetry breaking. Given the
similar energy and temperature induced broadening of
phonon linewidth from 10 K to 290 K ( 3 cm−1 broaden-
ing for V1 mode, and 3.6 cm−1 for A2
g mode), one would
expect a similar temperature independent broadening at
low temperature. However as described below we found
that upon cooling to 10 K, the A2
g mode becomes much
narrower, as is typically observed, while the V1 mode
remains considerably broad. Perhaps more problematic,
disorder or symmetry-breaking induced IR modes in Ra-
man spectra are typically very weak[27] and cannot be
as strong as ordinary Raman modes (especially when one
compares the V1 mode to the A2
g mode at room temper-
ature).

Richter et al.[6] also observed this mode and suspected
it to be a splitting of the A2
g mode resulting from the lo-
cal change in bonds between the diﬀerent chalcogenide
layers (ie. Se in the middle of the quintuple versus Te
in the outer layers). However, these measurements were
performed at room temperature and thus could not tell
whether this was indeed a local mode. Defects could
also enable non-zone center phonons to appear in the
Raman spectra, as is typically seen in graphite (i.e. the
D-band). This mechanism can generate a broad Raman
proﬁle due to the participation of multiple modes.[28]
This phenomenon is usually related to electronic reso-
nance eﬀect. Nonetheless, this possibility also seems un-
likely, when comparing Bi2Te2Se to Bi2Te3. Speciﬁcally
Bi2Te3 has of a large density of BiT e antisite defects that

generally lead to its heavy p-type doping.[2, 29]. Consid-
ering the high similarity in both electronic and phonon
structure between Bi2Te3 and Bi2Te2Se , one should also
observe a “V1-like” mode in Bi2Te3.[25] Nonetheless de-
spite extensive Raman measurements by various groups,
the V1 mode has only been observed in samples with Se
doping.[6, 30]

The comparison with Bi2Te3 suggests we carefully con-
sider the role of Se in generating this new Raman mode.
In theory, Se enters the SeII site and not the TeI site.
Nonetheless scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) stud-
ies have established several types of defects.[29] They are
adatoms remnant from the cleavage process, TeI -SeII an-
tisites, TeI -Bi antisites and SeI -Bi antisites respectively.
A further study using X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) showed
in Bi2Te2Se 8.5% of SeII atoms are replaced by Te and
4.17 % of TeI atoms are substituted by Se. The site oc-
cupancy factor of Bi is 1.[2] Therefore, the Se-Te antisite
is the major defect in Bi2Te2Se. A point defect, such as
the Te-Se antisite, can cause a local mode that vibrates
at its own frequency with a considerably broad line-
width.[15] Such local modes have been observed in many
semiconductors like Ge-Si alloys[31], CdSe0.985S0.015,[32],
BaySr1−yF2,[33] SryCa1−yF2[33] and so on. A similar
temperature dependence of the line-width has been ob-
served in Iodine intercalated Bi2Sr2CuO6.[34] There I+

line narrows (19 cm−1 to 16 cm−1) from room tempera-
ture to 30 K but remains considerably broad very similar
to our observation (14.4 cm−1 to 11.7 cm−1). Besides,
the intensity of a defect mode can be strong and compa-
rable to other phonon modes as were observed in GaN
and Co-doped ZnO ﬁlms.[35, 36] Thus, it is very likely
the V1 mode is a local mode caused by the point defect
Te-Se antisite.

To gain more quantitative insights, we focus on the
temperature dependent Raman spectra of Bi2Te2Se over
the whole temperature range (shown in FIG. 3). We ﬁt
the Raman spectra with Voigt proﬁle functions,

V (x, σ, Ω, Γ) =

G(x(cid:48), σ)L(x − x(cid:48), Ω, Γ)dx(cid:48)

which is the convolution of a Gaussian and a Lorentzian.
The Gaussian is employed to account for the instrumental
resolution and the Lorentzian represents a phonon mode.
The half width σ of the Gaussian was determined by the
instrumental resolution, which is 1.8 cm−1 in our system.
The extracted temperature dependent phonon shifts Ω
and line-widths Γ are shown in FIG. 4.

From the plot, we can see that all phonon modes
sharpen and harden as the temperature is decreased.
This naturally results from the anharmonic phonon-
phonon interaction which leads to a renormalization of
phonon shifts and line-widths. To analyze the temper-
ature dependent behavior, Klemens’s model was used,
which is only an approximation to the phonon-phonon in-
teraction, but widely used to interpret anharmonicity.[16,
37] In this model, an optical phonon is assumed to decay
into two phonons with opposite momentum while the “co-

alescence” process where a phonon and a second phonon
fuse into a third phonon is neglected, because it requires
an existing population of phonons, which are very small
at low temperatures.[38] Klemens’s model reads,[39]

Ω(ω, T ) = Ω0 + C[2nB(ω0/2) + 1]
Γ(ω, T ) = Γ0 + A[2nB(ω0/2) + 1]

where Γ0 can be interpreted as the contribution from the
crystalline disorder, Ω0 is the harmonic phonon shift, nB
is the Bose-Einstein function, and A and C are the co-
eﬃcients representing three-phonon (cubic) interaction.
The resulting ﬁts are also shown in FIG. 4. Judging for
all the ﬁgures, we can see that the model works very well.
The complete ﬁt parameters including errors are listed in
Table I. Among all the modes, the temperature indepen-
dent Γ0 is dramatically larger for the V1 mode, almost
three times that of the A2
g mode. However, the A and
C follow the trend of increasing as a function of phonon
frequency.

To qualitatively explain this, we employed statistical
analysis, which was used to handle disordered eﬀects.[40]
We can think of Bi2Te2Se crystal as constituted of many
atomic chains. Raman modes in Bi2Te2Se only involve
Bi and TeI sites,[6] thus, a perfect chain consists of Bi
and Te atoms one after the other. Since our sample has
defects, some Te atoms will be randomly replaced by Se

were checked as well no qualitative diﬀerence was found.
Thus our observation that the V1 mode contains a much
larger Γ0 than the other phonon modes is consistent with
a mode originating from local defects.

Up to now, we have only discussed the broadening
from temperature independent participation of many lo-
cal modes. For the temperature dependent anharmonic
coupling, it has been shown that local modes can couple
to lower energy modes as has already been observed in the
skutterudites[41], clathrates[7] and other materials.[15]
As the simulation shows, all the local modes are very
close in energy. Therefore, one expects these modes to
follow the same temperature dependence it is driven by
Bose-Einstein statistics with nearly identical energies.[15]
Consequently, even though the V1 mode proﬁle in theory
consists of many modes, these modes broaden and soften
with the same pace as the temperature rises. Thus, the
temperature dependent behavior of the V1 mode can still
be explained by Klemens’s model.

After clarifying the origin of the anomalous line-width
of the V1 mode, we focus on the anharmonic behavior.
Comparing the amplitude of ‘A’ and ‘C’ among the four
modes, we ﬁnd that they monotonically increase with
mode energy. This is because the anharmonic coeﬃcients
are determined by the phonon joint density of states,

JD(ω) =(cid:80) δ(ω − ω1 − ω2). Here ω1 and ω2 are the en-

ergies of the two phonons that the phonon ω decays into.
JD(ω) normally is a monotonically increasing function
of ω. Thus the anharmonic coeﬃcients are likely to be
a monotonically increasing function of ω which is consis-
tent with the ﬁt results.

In summary, we performed temperature dependent Ra-
man scattering measurement on Bi2Te2Se. Four modes
were observed in the entire temperature range. Three of
them were assigned as the zone center modes. The extra
mode (V1) was shown most likely to be an antisite de-
fects induced local mode. The anomalous broadness of
the local mode was clariﬁed through an simple model of
diatomic chains. The temperature dependence of the four
modes were explained by an anharmonic phonon-phonon
interaction model.
Inelastic Neutron scattering studies
on Bi2Te2Se are clearly called for to help elucidate the
true nature of this mode and its role in other properties
of the material such as thermal transport. Work at the

atoms. The energies of the local modes in these chains
have much larger dependence on the conﬁguration of Se
atoms in the chain than that of a normal phonon mode.
Consequently, the observed spectra consists of many lo-
cal modes with slightly diﬀerent frequencies, resulting in
much larger broadening than normal phonon modes.

To test the validity of above statements, a simple
model adopted from the literature[15] was used to cal-
culate the vibrational modes of a one dimensional cir-
cular diatomic chain. The original chain consists of 48
atoms of two types atoms (a,b) with the conﬁguration
...a − b − a − b.... The mass of atom a (b) was set to
2.58 (4). The force constant was set to be 1. To sim-
ulate the local modes, two atoms a were replaced by a
“defect” atom c with mass 1.57. The masses were chosen
based on the real mass ratio of Te (a), Bi (b) and Se (c)
atoms. The number of the “defect” atom c was chosen
to represent 4.17% disorder obtained by XRD. Since two
atoms are replaced, there will be two local modes in the
chain. Twenty trials were run and for each trial two sites
of atom a were randomly chosen to be replaced by atom
c. The results of two local modes as well as a non-local
mode (phonon mode) are shown in FIG. 5 We can see
from the plot, although among diﬀerent trials, both local
modes and the phonon mode are very close in energy,
the variation in energy of the local modes is much larger
than that of the phonon mode. The other phonon modes
