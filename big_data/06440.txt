Ideal graphene antidot lattices can show promising band gap behavior (i.e., EG (cid:39) 500 meV) under
carefully speciﬁed conditions. However, for the structures studied so far this behavior is critically
dependent on superlattice geometry and is not robust against experimentally realistic disorders.
Here we study a square array of triangular antidots with zigzag edge geometries and show that their
band gap behavior qualitatively diﬀers from the standard behavior which is exhibited, e.g, by square
arrays of armchair-edged triangles. In the spin unpolarized case, zigzag-edged antidots give rise to
large band gaps which are stable both for diﬀerent superlattice geometries and in the presence of
strong disorder. The inclusion of spin polarization within a mean-ﬁeld Hubbard approach gives rise
to a large overall magnetic moment at each antidot due to the sublattice imbalance imposed by
the triangular geometry. The band gap sizes are reduced compared to the unpolarized case, but a
strong half-metallic behavior arises from the formation of spin-split dispersive states near the Fermi
energy. This behavior is also found to be robust in the presence of strong disorder. Our results
highlight the possibilities of using triangular perforations in graphene to open electronic band gaps
in systems with experimentally realistic levels of disorder, and furthermore, of exploiting the strong
spin dependence of the system for spintronic applications.

INTRODUCTION

Two-dimensional materials continually gain interest
and achieve huge advances towards industrial realization
in a number of ﬁelds, particularly electronics and spin-
tronics. Graphene is the most studied material within the
two-dimensional family1 due to unique properties such
as high electron mobilities2 above 105 cm V−1 s−1, gate-
tunable carrier concentration3, and predicted long spin-
relaxation lengths4 of several µm. These studies have led
to substantial eﬀorts in fabricating and processing clean
graphene systems5 as well as pushing the limits of nanos-
tructuring e.g. by high-resolution lithography.6,7 To real-
ize graphene-based electronics and in particular transis-
tors, opening a band-gap has been one of the main drivers
of both theoretical and experimental work. Many stud-
ies propose using structural modiﬁcations of graphene
systems, such as nanoribbons8, or superlattice structures
imposed by periodic gating9,10 or strain,11,12 to achieve a
band gap. More recent attempts have considered chemi-
cal modiﬁcation through absorption or substitution.13,14
Periodic perforation of graphene sheets to form so-called
graphene antidot lattices (GAL), or nanomeshes, is of
particular interest since theoretical predictions suggest
the possibility of obtaining sizable band gaps.15,16 Sev-
eral groups have realized these structures in the lab.17,18
Band gaps induced in nanostructured graphene are how-
ever very sensitive to disorder and defects.19 Current fab-
rication methods will inevitably yield systems with a sig-
niﬁcant degree of disorder. A clear experimental signa-
ture of minibands and -gaps has yet been elusive. In the
magnetic and spintronic areas, the possibility of making
graphene magnetic or realizing graphene-based spintron-
ics has also attracted a lot of attention.4 It has been

predicted that pristine graphene exhibits uniquely long
spin-relaxations times4 ∼ 1 µs, although to date experi-
ments20–22 still ﬁnd relaxation times at least two orders
of magnitudes lower; reasons for this are still under de-
bate. Inducing magnetic ordering, or at least magnetic
moments, is desirable in order to achieve tunable mag-
netism useful for magnetic information storage or spin-
manipulation devices. There have been many works, the-
oretical and experimental, studying magnetic moments
induced by vacancy defects23–26, adatoms23,26,27, sub-
strate coupling and molecular doping28. Nanostructured
graphene is also predicted to display signiﬁcant spin po-
larization at certain extended edges, namely those with
a zigzag (zz) geometry.29 Recent experimental ﬁndings
also support the prospect of magnetic zz-edges even with
a reasonable amount of edge-roughness observed.30–32

In this work, we propose using superlattices of trian-
gular shaped GALs with entirely zz-edges to gain largely
spin polarized nanostructures, as conﬁrmed by previous
ab initio studies.33,34 Even before spin polarization is
considered, we show through our tight-binding study how
these lattices form extremely robust band gaps. When
the eﬀects of spin are included, a similarly robust half-
metallicity is displayed near the Fermi level, allowing
for only either spin up or down states at a particular
energy.
In contrast to the half-metallic behavior pre-
dicted for nanoribbon devices29, triangular antidots nat-
urally exhibit half-metallicity without the need for dif-
ﬁcult side-gates and transverse electrical ﬁelds. We en-
visage that triangular antidots could be fabricated, for
example, through lithography using patterned hexagonal
boron-nitride as a mask. Hexagonal boron-nitride nat-
urally etches into triangular-holes due to the diﬀerent
etch rates of the two species i.e. boron and nitrogen.35

formed potential is nonzero at the Dirac points of pris-
tine graphene.39 From hereon this criterion is referred to
as the periodic modulation rule, PMR. For rectangular
superlattices, due to the lattice orientation chosen, the
electronic behavior depends critically on the X spacing.
All antidot lattices for which X = 3p where p = 1, 2, 3, ...
are semiconducting, while all other antidot lattices de-
pend on the particular antidot.39 Embedding the same
triangles into rectangular superlattices of diﬀerent na-
ture allows us to identify properties which arise due to
the triangles themselves. The triangular antidots we con-
sider are aligned to have either zz-edges shown in Fig. 1
or ac-edges (not shown). The latter ac-edged triangles
are rotated by 30◦ with respect to those in Fig. 1 and
the side length is scaled diﬀerently for the two orienta-
√
tions. L corresponds to a side length of La for the zigzag
case and (L

3a) for the armchair case.

Spin polarization at single-point defects, as well as that
at zz-edges, is usually interpreted via Lieb’s theorem.40
The theorem states that the total ground state magnetic
moment of a half-ﬁlled bipartite lattice is given by the
sublattice imbalance, M = µB|NA − NB| ≡ µB∆N ,
where NA and NB are the are the number of sites be-
longing to each sublattice. Creating a zz-triangle, such
as that in Fig. 1,
involves removing a diﬀerent num-
ber of sites from the two sublattices and results in edge
atoms belonging only to a single sublattice; with the ori-
entation shown in Fig. 1 this is sublattice B. Accord-
ingly, zz-triangles form nonzero total magnetic moments,
in full compliance with Lieb’s theorem.33,34 Rotating
the antidot 180◦ ﬂips the triangle orientation and also
swaps the edge sublattice. Thus the relative edge sub-
lattices of two adjacent triangular antidots can be deter-
mined by a quick visual inspection. The ac-triangle has
both sublattices present at the edge and is not expected
to exhibit spin polarization.36 We examine both the
{X, Y, L} = {24, 15, (5zz/3ac)} and {25, 15, (5zz/3ac)}
geometries; i.e. two geometries diﬀering by a along the
x-direction and with either zz- or ac-edged triangular per-
forations; we later focus on the {25, 15, 5zz} superlattice
with the zz-triangle displayed in Fig. 1. The side lengths
of the zz- and ac-edged triangles are similar for these ge-
ometries. The two triangle orientations are compared to
show the fundamental diﬀerences between zz-edged tri-
angular antidots and other antidot families represented
by the ac-edged cases.

Kinks or chirality within triangle edges may form dur-
ing fabrication, but it is likely that they will still dis-
play a magnetic signature, albeit reduced, in accordance
with theory for chiral graphene nanoribbons36. Our ﬁnd-
ings suggest a realistic path towards fabricating realistic
spin polarized graphene nanostructures which could act
as components in graphene-based spintronic devices.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
The system geometries and electronic and spin polariza-
tion models are described in Section II. Then we present
our results in Section III, ﬁrst considering several rep-
resentative geometries in Section III A of both zz-edged
and armchair(ac)-edged triangles without spin polariza-
tion. Next we focus on a single zz-edged antidot lattice
and include spin-interaction in Section III B. Finally we
consider the robustness of our results by extending the
tight-binding description in Section III C and by consid-
ering the eﬀect of positional disorder in Section III D. In
Section IV, we discuss our ﬁndings and other important
considerations.

II. GEOMETRY AND MODEL

Consider rectangular arrays of triangular antidots as
shown schematically in Fig. 1. Speciﬁc geometries are
denoted using {X, Y, Lgeo} where X and Y represent the
inter-antidot spacings in the two in-plane directions, L
is the side length of the triangular antidot and the index
geo = ac or zz denotes the edge geometry of the triangles.
X and Y take integer values and the associated antidot
separations are Xa and
3Y a respectively, where the
graphene lattice constant a = 2.46 ˚A. The rectangular
superlattice makes for an ideal testbed for antidot lattices
as the electronic properties change qualitatively when the
lattice dimensions are varied, e.g. a semiconducting su-
perlattice can become metallic and vice versa by changing
the dimensions by just one lattice constant.15,37–39 Any
periodic potential imposed onto graphene, for example
an antidot lattice, forms a band gap if the Fourier trans-

III. RESULTS

A. Unpolarized antidots with diﬀerent lattice

geometries

We ﬁrst consider periodic structures of zz- or ac-
triangular antidots in the U = 0 case. The bandstruc-
tures of zz and ac-triangular antidots, together with their
total density of states and that projected onto sublattice
B, are shown in Fig. 2. The zz cases, shown in Fig. 1a
and Fig. 1b for the {24, 15, 5zz} and {25, 15, 5zz} ge-
ometries respectively, reveal both sizable band gaps and
dispersionless midgap states. These midgap states have a
degeneracy equal to the sublattice imbalance ∆N , which
here is equal to L = 5. The appearance of such states can
be understood from the behavior of single atom vacan-
cies and zigzag edged nanoribbons as follows. Graphene
vacancies, which create a local sublattice imbalance, are
known to form states which are localized on the majority
sublattice sites surrounding the vacancy and which have
a very narrow energy spectrum.44 Zigzag-edged graphene
nanoribbons have equivalent numbers of atoms on each
sublattice, but have a local sublattice imbalance near ei-
ther edge. This leads to ribbon edge states, localized
entirely on the edge sublattice, which decay exponen-
tially into the ribbon.41,45 A ﬁnite ribbon width means
that states from either edge overlap near the ribbon cen-
ter. Decreasing the ribbon width deforms the low en-
ergy bandstructure continuously from dispersionless edge
states to states with a ﬁnite occupation of both sublat-
tices near the ribbon center which supports dispersion.
Thus the proximity of multiple edges associated with op-
posite sublattices prevents the formation of completely
dispersionless edge states. We note that such states can
also become dispersive if higher order hopping parame-
ters are included, as we will discuss later. In the case of
the zz-edged triangles within the NN approximation, all
the edges belong to the same sublattice and the states
remain completely dispersionless.

The other characteristic of zz-edged triangular antidot
lattices apparent from Fig. 1a and b is the formation of
large electronic band gaps surrounding the dispersionless
midgap states. Superlattices in graphene are convention-
ally expected to open electronic band gaps according to
the PMR, and this only occurs in rectangular lattices for
cases when X = 3p. This rule is obeyed by the ac-edged
cases shown in Fig. 1c and d where the {24, 15, 3ac} dis-
plays a band gap and the {25, 15, 3ac} is metallic, as pre-
dicted for these superlattice geometries. The zz-triangle
lattices both display large band gaps regardless of the
superlattice geometry, which indicates that a diﬀerent
mechanism is underlying the band gap formation in these
systems.

This hypothesis is supported by examining the band
gap magnitudes of triangular antidot lattices. Peder-
sen et al. demonstrated that a scaling behavior Egap ∝
XY was followed by many gapped graphene anti-

The inclusion of t2 results in a band-center shift, which
we compensate for by adding a uniform on-site shift so
that the Fermi energy lies at E = 0. Electron-electron
interactions and the resulting spin polarization are in-
cluded via spin-dependent on-site energy terms found
from a self-consistent solution of the Hubbard model

agreement with full ab initio calculations for nanoribbon
systems.42,43 The self-consistent Hubbard calculations
are initiated with an antiferromagnetic guess, mi = ±c,
with opposite signs used for the two sublattices A and B,
and then iterated to convergence.

FIG. 3. Unpolarized band gaps for various geometries as X,
Y , and L are varied. The zigzag (blue) and armchair (green)
triangle geometries are divided into groups where the super-
lattice is expected to display semiconducting (sc, ﬁlled) or
metallic (m, hollow) behavior. For a rectangular superlattice
this distinction depends solely on the value of X.

dot lattices15, where Nrem and Ntot are, respectively, the
number of atoms removed to form an antidot and the to-
tal number of atoms in the superlattice unit cell before
the antidot atoms are removed. In Fig. 3, a linear behav-
ior is clearly noted for those ac-edged systems with super-
lattices predicting semiconducting behavior (ﬁlled green
squares) whereas those for metallic superlattices (hollow
green squares) have zero band gap in almost all cases.
We associate the breakdown of this trend for metallic
systems with large L
XY to the fact that additional band
gap behavior is now induced by small constrictions be-
tween large antidots in small unit cells. The zz-triangles
are meanwhile consistently gapped (blue circles), irre-
spective of the behavior predicted by superlattice argu-
ments. The band gap magnitude has an approximately
linear dependence on L
XY , but the slope is much greater
than the ac case. The presence of zz-edges is not enough
to explain the robust band gaps, as other nanostructures
with extended zz-edges are reported to follow expected
antidot lattice behavior.16,39,46 The zz-hexagonal antidot
lattice, for example, shows a much smaller band gap in
the unpolarized case than what we report here.16 How-
ever, for zz-hexagons each sublattice has three associated
zz-edges so that in total |NA − NB| = 0. This suggests
that the large band gap present in the zz-triangle cases
is due to the sublattice imbalance introduced when each
antidot has zz-edges belonging to only a single sublattice.

The sublattice-projected densities of states (DOS) for
zz-triangle lattices in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b show that each
sublattice contributes equally to the DOS at all ener-
gies except at the E = 0 edge states which reside only
on the B sublattice. However the local density of states
(LDOS), shown in Fig. 4, reveals a more complex pic-
ture. The edge state localization is clear in Fig. 4a where
the LDOS is mapped at E = 0 by circles whose radius
is proportional to the LDOS at that site. White and
black circles are used for sites on the A and B sublattices
respectively, and we note that only large black circles
near the triangle edges are found for this energy. Despite

(b) at the energy E = 0.1|t|. A white (black) circle is placed
on every site on the A (B) sublattice and its radius is scaled

a dashed red line. For clarity, the radii in (a) are reduced by
a factor of 10 relative to those in (b).

the overall DOS sublattice balance at other energies, the
LDOS distributes inhomogeneously around the triangles.
This is shown in Fig. 4b for the conduction band energy
E = 0.1|t|, where we note that the B sublattice contri-
bution to the DOS is now spread throughout most of
the unit cell, but is signiﬁcantly larger near the triangle
edges. The A sublattice has a vanishing LDOS in this
region and its DOS contribution is mostly at sites mid-
way between neighboring antidots. The dispersion of the
states at this energy is due to the large regions where
both sublattices have a signiﬁcant occupation. However,
the diﬀerent electron distributions for the A and B sub-
lattices suggest a very diﬀerent eﬀective scattering po-
tential for the diﬀerent sublattices. zz-triangles thus act
in a similar manner to a mass term, i.e. a staggered
on-site potential, with a diﬀerent on-site potential for
each sublattice. Such a term opens band gaps in other
systems where sublattice symmetry is broken, for exam-
ple, by doping.47,48 We therefore propose that the mech-
anism driving band gap formation in zz-edged systems is
the geometrical sublattice imbalance and not the PMR
usually behind band gaps in graphene antidot lattices.
Importantly, this suggests that band gap behavior in zz-
triangles should be stable against geometrical variations
as long as the sublattice imbalance is maintained. Since
the geometry of the antidot lattice plays a minor minor
role, one may expect that lattices made of triangular zz-
edged antidots are robust against disorder, as we proceed
to show.

B. Eﬀect of spin polarization

A nonzero Hubbard-interaction (U = 1.33|t|) leads to
spin dependence in zz-edged triangle systems through the
formation of magnetic moments mi. The self-consistent
solution to the Hubbard model using the {25, 15, 5zz} ge-
ometry is shown in Fig. 5. Diﬀerent superlattice and tri-

FIG. 5. The magnetic moments surrounding a triangle in
the {25, 15, 5zz} geometry. Spin up (mi > 0, red) and spin
down (mi < 0,blue) moments are represented by circles whose
radii are scaled by |mi| at each site. The largest spin up
(mi = 0.31) and spin down (mi = −0.06) moments are lo-
cated respectively on an edge and on a site immediately next
to the edge. The moments throughout the structure are anti-
ferromagnetic i.e. the sign of a moment is directly correlated
to the sublattice on which it resides.

that that M =(cid:80)

angle dimensions always yield a similar pattern, namely
a distribution with antiferromagnetic alignment between
moments on the diﬀerent sublattices. The magnitude
of the moments is maximum at the zz-edges, decreases
slightly towards the corners of the triangles, and quickly
decays perpendicular to the zz-edges. Similar moment
distributions have been reported in ab initio studies
of triangular perforations33. Triangles with large side
lengths have long segments with approximately constant
magnetic moments with a maximum mi ∼ 0.31µB. Only
below L < 5 do these constant-moment segments vanish
and the maximum moment decreases. All the geome-
tries considered are consistent with Lieb’s theorem such
i miµB = µB∆N ≡ µBL. The trian-
gle corners are geometrically similar to the kinks arising
in chiral graphene nanoribbons, which display a similar
drop in moment values.36 The magnetic moment proﬁle
is found to be almost completely independent of the su-
perlattice geometry, suggesting that nearby triangles do
not inﬂuence each other unless they are very near.
The spin-split band structure of the {25, 15, 5zz} sys-
tem is shown in Fig. 6a, together with the spin up (red)
and spin down (blue) DOS in Fig. 6b. As before, the
lighter regions show the total DOS and the darker regions
show its projection onto the edge sublattice. There are
a number of key diﬀerences from the unpolarized band
structure of the same geometry system in Fig. 2b com-
pared to the spin polarized bandstructure in Fig. 6a. The
ﬁve-fold degenerate dispersionless bands are no longer
present at zero energy and the band gap is considerably
reduced by the presence of dispersive bands at the en-
ergies E = ±0.02|t|. These bands have opposite spin
orientations on either side of E = 0, as do the ﬁve
low-dispersive non-degenerate bands in the energy range
(±)0.1|t| → 0.15|t|. To examine the formation of this
bandstructure the Hubbard-interaction U is varied from a
low U = 0.2|t| to U = 1.33|t| in Fig. 6c, left to right. The
band structures in these panels correspond to the region

shown by the dashed box in Fig. 6a. We denote three low
energy spin down bands V, VI, and VII at low Hubbard-
interaction strength U = 0.2|t|, the ﬁfth through seventh
lowest energy spin down bands in this region. In the un-
polarized bandstructure, band V corresponds to one of
the ﬁve-fold degenerate dispersionless bands whereas VI
and VII form the conduction bands. The V, VI, and VII
bands are labeled both at the left- and right-most panels
for clarity. These panels reveal how the formerly degen-
erate and dispersionless bands undergo diﬀerent degrees
of spin splitting, and that the highest of these (V) ini-
tially (left) appears below both bands VI and VII and
ﬁnally (right) appears above said bands. The LDOS at
E = 0.155|t|, corresponding to band V and shown in
Fig. 7a, is localized almost entirely on magnetic edge-
sites, consistent with a large degree of spin splitting.
Meanwhile, the LDOS of the spin polarized conduction
bands at E = 0.02|t| shown in Fig. 7b is mostly localized
near the triangle corners which have smaller magnetic
moments, consistent with a small degree of spin split-
ting. Further, the dispersion of the conduction bands
is shown to emerge due to a non-zero occupation of the
A sublattice as shown in Fig. 7b.
In the unpolarized
case bands VI and VII deﬁne the conduction band edge,
but as U increases (see Fig. 6c), the spin-down versions
ﬂatten and increase in energy, whereas the spin up ver-
sions broaden and decrease slightly in energy. We noted
earlier that the unpolarized cases displayed LDOS contri-
butions from both sublattices, which overlapped to form
dispersive conduction bands. When spin polarized, this

distribution is quite diﬀerent for each spin. The LDOS
of the spin down band shown in Fig. 7c is localized al-
most entirely on B sublattice sites near the center of the
zz-edge sections, which leads to a ﬂattening of the dis-
persion and an upwards energy shift. Conversely, the
LDOS of the spin up bands shown in Fig. 7d is localized
both on the B sublattice near the antidot corners and on
sites from both sublattices further away from the trian-
gle. The more homogeneous distribution of the spin up
bands leads to further broadening and a weaker down-
wards shift from spin-splitting.

The band gaps for spin polarized zz-triangles are shown
for a range of geometries in Fig. 8, where we note a
decrease of approximately one order of magnitude com-
pared to the unpolarized cases. In fact, the gaps of semi-
conducting ac-triangles are larger than those for polar-
ized zz-triangles. However, spin polarized zz-edged anti-
dots display another interesting feature. The dispersive
states surrounding the band gap are completely spin po-
larized, so that a spin-selective half-metallicity can be
induced by small EF shifts applied using a back gate.
This suggests that such geometries may be employed in
a range of spintronic components to ﬁlter spins of diﬀer-
ent orientations.

Many of the features we have described in both unpo-
larized and polarized zz-triangles depend on inhomoge-
neous electron distributions and in particular signiﬁcant

is important to determine if such features are artifacts
of the NN model we employ for our calculations, and
whether they are robust in the face of disorder. The
latter point is of interest as many eﬀects induced by su-
perlattices tend to vanish at any realistic disorder.19 We
now brieﬂy address both issues.

Eﬀect of higher order hopping terms

Within the NN model, states which occupy only a sin-
gle sublattice appear completely dispersionless. In com-
parison, a 3NN model enables intra-sublattice coupling
by the inclusion of the 2NN terms, and the parametriza-
tion we use has been shown to accurately describe zz-
nanoribbons.41 For the unpolarized case, we note that the
introduction of these additional hopping terms leads to
an energy splitting of the previously degenerate midgap
states, see Fig. 9a and b. This leads to a shift of the
Fermi energy relative to the bulk valence and conduc-
tion bands in order to satisfy half-ﬁlling, increasing the
electron-hole asymmetry already introduced by the 2NN
hoppings. Furthermore, the NN-model band gap can be
identiﬁed in the 3NN band structure between the energies
E = −0.025|t| and E = 0.1|t|, but is now slightly smaller
and more importantly contains multiple midgap states.
In particular a dispersive channel opens at E ∼ 0.05|t|,
similar to that seen near zz-ribbon edges when a 3NN
model is employed.49 Disregarding these midgap states,
the 3NN band gap between E = −0.025|t| and E = 0.1|t|
scales similarly to the NN model when varying the sys-
tem dimensions. The emergence of dispersive states in
the band gap could of course limit the applicability of
these systems. However we note that in many cases they
have either very little dispersion, or are spaced far enough
apart in energy, so as to still oﬀer reasonable band gap
or transport gap behaviors.

Considering the polarized case, the band structures
and DOS in Fig. 9c and d are remarkably similar despite
the large changes we have discussed in their associated
unpolarized versions. The most signiﬁcant change now
between NN and 3NN models is the expected (minor)
electron-hole asymmetry. Notably the system remains
half metallic with spin-dependent dispersive states close
to the Fermi level. The excellent agreement between NN
and 3NN models in this case can be understood by the
fact that the features introduced by the additional 3NN
terms in the unpolarized case, namely dispersion and
splitting of the midgap states, also result independently
from the inclusion of the spin-dependent potentials. We
note that the 3NN model, both with and without spin po-
larization, also agrees qualitatively with previous ab ini-
tio calculations, which display similar band structures.33
Although the 3NN model serves to correct the missing
inter-sublattice interaction, it appears that the most im-
portant behavior in polarized systems is captured by the
lower order NN model.

D. Robustness against disorder

One of the major obstacles in inducing band gaps us-
ing graphene antidots is that the large gaps predicted in
atomically precise systems are extremely fragile in the
presence of even mild geometrical disorders.19 The gap
mechanism for usual antidot arrays, namely the PMR,

relies on pristine conditions and regular antidot spacing.
We have shown that zz-edged triangular antidots behave
very diﬀerently from other antidots, and that their be-
havior arises from the breaking of sublattice symmetries
around individual antidots. We further demonstrated
that these eﬀects were independent of the superlattice
geometry, which suggests also that they should be more
stable in the face of disorder. While a full-ﬂedged dis-
order analysis is beyond the scope of the present paper,
we highlight the essential eﬀects by examining a 4 × 4
geometrically disordered array of antidots in a repeated
superlattice. The triangle centers are shifted relative to
each other within this unit cell, as shown for zz-triangles

ΓXMX0ΓΓXMX0Γ(a)(b)(c)ΓXMX0Γ−0.2−0.100.10.2E/|t|ΓXMX0Γ(d)(e)ΓXMX0ΓΓXMX0Γ(a)(b)(c)in Fig. 10a and ac-triangles in Fig. 11a. The same size
triangles as before are considered, but for computational
eﬃciency we use smaller {X = 15, Y = 9} “blocks”
to compose the supercell, essentially cutting down on
the amount of pristine graphene between perforations.
Note that this superlattice geometry is predicted to con-
tain a band gap according to the PMR.39 Pristine band
structures calculated within the 4 × 4 framework are
shown for unpolarized and polarized {15, 9, 5zz} systems
in Fig. 10b and d respectively, and for the (unpolarized)
{15, 9, 3ac} system in Fig. 11b. All calculations here were
performed within the 3NN model. We note that larger
gaps are present in all cases due to the reduced X and
Y values, and that signiﬁcant folding of the bands has
occurred due to the larger supercell. However the same
qualitative behavior for zz-edges from Fig. 9b and ac-
edges from Fig. 2c is evident. Despite the strong disorder
introduced by shifting the zz-triangle center positions, as
shown in Fig. 10a, there is no qualitative change in either
the polarized or unpolarized band structures, Fig. 10c
and e respectively. The gapped regions in the unpolar-
ized case, Fig. 10c, are only partially quenched due to a
small energy spreading of states. The polarized bands,
Fig. 10e, show even less variance relative to the ordered
case. The DOS of the disordered case in Fig. 10c and
e conﬁrms that the sizable band gap and half metallic
behavior are robust against severe geometric disorder.
In contrast, similar levels of disorder quench the gap al-
most entirely for ac-edged triangles, as demonstrated in
Fig. 11c. This is consistent with results for other disor-
dered antidot systems whose band gap emerges from the
PMR.19

IV. CONCLUSION

8

We have discussed the electronic properties of triangu-
lar antidots systems in graphene sheets, with a particular
focus on zigzag edged geometries whose geometry breaks
the symmetry between graphene’s two sublattices. To
shed light on the possibility of magnetic states at such
edges, we have analyzed such systems in both spin po-
larized and unpolarized cases. We demonstrate that un-
spinpolarized lattices of triangular zz-edged antidots dis-
play a more robust band gap formation than their ac-
edged counterparts. Unlike traditional antidot systems
in graphene, gap-opening occurs regardless of superlat-
tice geometry and is far more robust against geometric
disorders. We conclude that these unique features are
caused by a gap-opening mechanism related to sublattice-
symmetry breaking, and are not due to the conventional
superlattice geometry mechanisms which are sensitive to
experimentally unavoidable imperfections in lattice spac-
ings. zz-edged systems become half-metallic over wide
energy ranges when spin polarization is included, with
a high degree of spin selectivity achievable by gating.
This behavior is due to the emergence of dispersive spin-
dependent states within the band gap of the unpolarized
case. The half-metallic behavior is also found to survive
signiﬁcant geometric disorder in the superlattice. These
ﬁndings suggest a robust path to realize devices based
on nanostructured graphene with robust band gaps. Fur-
ther, devices with half-metallic and spin-selective prop-
erties appear feasible.
