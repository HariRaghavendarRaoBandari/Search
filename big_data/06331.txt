ABSTRACT

We modify upon the algorithm we proposed before in (Aghamousa & Shaﬁeloo 2015)
on time delay estimation of the strong lens systems incorporating weighted cross correla-
tion, deﬁning two tuning parameters in the analysis and optimizing the method (deriving
its parameters) by trading oﬀ between the bias and variance using many Monte Carlo
simulations. We apply our proposed method on the light curves of the lensed quasar
SDSS J1001+5027 since this system has been well studied by other groups to compare
our results with their ﬁndings. In this work we propose two estimators namely “mean”
and “mirror” estimators and we show that these two estimators should result to con-
sistent and accurate estimations. Our mirror estimator results to −117.1+1.6−1.0 days time
delay for this system and our mean estimator results to −119.8+1.8−0.8 days using Monte
Carlo simulations to estimate the uncertainties. These two estimations are very much
consistent with results of the other groups, however, the small discrepancy between
these estimations hints towards some possible minor systematics in the data or inac-
curate estimation of the uncertainties of the data epochs. Using simulations provided
by (Rathna Kumar et al. 2013), where they account for some possible systematics in
the simulations, we got larger error bars on the estimated time delays while the mean
estimated values remained unchanged.

Introduction

Cosmology has moved towards becoming a precision science in last few decades by having
access to diﬀerent variety of data from various sources. Strong gravitational lensing systems contain

– 2 –

precocious information that can be used to estimate the expansion history of the universe (Linder
2004; Suyu et al. 2013). In a strong gravitational lensing system the light rays of a source quasar
propagate toward us experiencing the gravitation of a lensing galaxy along the diﬀerent optical
paths which result in multiple images. The light curves associated with these images show time
lags due to diﬀerences in optical paths and the gravitational potential of the lensing galaxy (Refsdal
1964; Kochanek 2002; Treu 2010). These information can be used to measure cosmological distances
through so-called time delay estimation. An accurate time delay estimation in combination with
a proper modeling of the lens galaxy can lead to an independent measurement of the Hubble
parameter (Suyu et al. 2009; Suyu et al. 2013). Using strong lens systems we can reconstruct
the expansion history of the universe in a complementary approach in comparison to the way we
measure the expansion history using standardized candles and rulers (using supernova data or
baryon acoustic oscillation) (Linder 2004, 2011; Suyu et al. 2012). To obtain this goal, we need
precise and accurate estimation of the time-delays (Tewes et al. 2013a,b; Hojjati & Linder 2014;
Aghamousa & Shaﬁeloo 2015) as well as a realistic modeling of the lensing systems (Oguri 2007;
Suyu et al. 2009, 2010; Fadely et al. 2010).

In this paper we present an improved version of our previous time delay estimation algorithm
that was proposed in (Aghamousa & Shaﬁeloo 2015) and was shown to be reliable in the Time
Delay Challenge (TDC) (Liao et al. 2015), applying it on a real data sample. In this new algorithm
we enhance the accuracy and precision of the estimator by using the error-sensitive weighted cross
correlation in the analysis (rather than simple cross-correlation) and implementing some additional
statistical criteria such as minimizing the Mean Squared Error in the calibration process. Using
these additional tools we oﬀer two time delay estimators with capability of tuning for a particular
data through simulations along with a sophisticated procedure of error estimation. Through the
simulation we show that both estimators are accurate and consistent.

We apply this algorithm on doubly lensed quasar SDSS J1001+5027 (Oguri et al. 2005)
which is one of strong lens systems monitored in a long term by COSMOGRAIL collaboration
(http://www.cosmograil.org) and results in two light curves of images which are publicly available
1 (Rathna Kumar et al. 2013). The COSMOGRAIL project has gathered light curves of tens of
lensed quasars and proposed several techniques for estimating the associated time delays. For this
particular system (SDSS J1001+5027) they have presented time delay measurements using ﬁve
diﬀerent techniques including three techniques introduced by (Tewes et al. 2013a), one by (Hojjati
et al. 2013) and a new algorithm by the collaboration authors. Considering the fact that the lensed
quasar SDSS J1001+5027 is the most well studied system in the literature we decided to focus
analyzing this system to compare our results with other existing ones.

In this paper we try to do various analysis in order to test reliability of the estimations con-
sidering systematics or artifacts in diﬀerent segments of the data. Our results show consistency
with the results obtained by other groups but we also present that the error analysis for the time

delay estimation for a realistic system like the one we studied in this work can be very tricky and
complicated.

In the following we ﬁrst describe the light curves data of SDSS J1001+5027 system (Section 2).
Next in Section 3 we start elaborating the methodology of our analysis which contains smooth-
ing method (Section 3.1), weighted cross-correlation (Section 3.2). We continue with explanation
of time delay estimation procedure (Section 3.3) and optimization of time delay estimators (Sec-
tion 3.4). It ends with a pedagogical elaboration of error estimation (Section 3.5). We present and
discuss the results of the analysis in Section 4 and ﬁnally we conclude this paper in Section 5.

2. Data

The SDSS J1001+5027 is a doubly lensed quasar at z=1.838 (α2000 = 10 : 01 : 28.61, δ2000 =
+50 : 27 : 56.90) (Oguri et al. 2005). The COSMOGRAIL collaboration monitored this system
for nearly six years through three diﬀerent telescopes (Rathna Kumar et al. 2013) and ﬁnally they
combined and corrected the light curves from these observations providing with a pair of light curves
for 443 independent epochs. Figure 1 illustrates the light curves A (red points) and B (blue points).
The time epochs of light curves are not equispaced and also have six gaps with the length more
than 70 days. These gaps divide the light curves in seven diﬀerent segments of data. In addition
each data light curve has diﬀerent error in diﬀerent epoch of time (this relates to an improvement
in our algorithm in this work). In the next Section we will elaborate on our improved time delay
estimation algorithm which considers all of these characteristics of the data.

3. Methodology

In principle the time delay between two light curves of a strong lens system can be estimated
by simply comparing them with each other looking at particular features in the data that are
shifted in time with respect to each other. However observations have generally some limitations
due to diﬀerent practical issues so it is not so trivial to ﬁnd such features in the light curves and
measure the time delay in a straightforward way. Hence algorithms should be designed in a way
to consider important characteristics of the data to get a reliable estimation.
In this work we
adopt and modify the algorithm proposed in (Aghamousa & Shaﬁeloo 2015) for our analysis which
consists of a smoothing method and cross-correlation to ﬁnd the time lag between light curves.
Here we use the similar smoothing method to obtain the smooth light curves but then we make
some important modiﬁcations in the method in computing the cross-correlation and also in error
estimation. We employ weighted cross-correlation that is error-sensitive and this is an important
characteristic since the actual data has diﬀerent uncertainties for diﬀerent data epoch. We also use
extensive Monte Carlo simulations to calibrate our estimators and derive the uncertainty proﬁle of
the time delays.

3.1. Smoothing method

We choose the same smoothing methodology used in (Aghamousa & Shaﬁeloo 2015) that was
proposed by (Shaﬁeloo et al. 2006; Shaﬁeloo 2007; Shaﬁeloo & Clarkson 2010) and (Shaﬁeloo 2012).
This method estimates the smooth light curve As(t) at the time t by an iterative algorithm:

where

As(t) = Ag(t) + N (t)

(cid:21)

σ2
d(ti)

The procedure starts with an initial guess model Ag(t) = Ag0(t) and then the ﬁrst smooth curve
As1(t) = As(t) will be obtained through Equation 1 where Ad(ti) and σd(ti) are the ith data point
and uncertainty in light curve data and ∆ is smoothing width. N (t) is the normalization factor
which is calculated via Equation 2. The new smooth ﬁt As2(t) is obtained in the next iteration by
substituting Ag(t) = As1(t) in Equation 1. The procedure can be continued to higher iterations.
While the ﬁnal result is almost independent of the initial guess model Ag0(t) (Shaﬁeloo 2007), the
smoothing width, ∆, plays important role in controlling the smoothness of the ﬁt. In other words,
the smoothing width determines the smallest size of the ﬁne structure in the data which appears in
the ﬁnal smooth ﬁt. In Section 3.4 we will show how we obtain the optimum ∆ value as a tuning
parameter of time delay estimators through Monte Carlo simulations. We should note that the
smooth ﬁt has dependency on the number of iterations ni as well but there is a mild degeneracy
between width of smoothing and ni so by ﬁxing one of them (preferably ni) we can calibrate the
other one to ﬁnd the optimum combination (Shaﬁeloo 2007). In this work we ﬁx ni = 3 similar to
(Aghamousa & Shaﬁeloo 2015) and treat it as a ﬁxed parameter in the analysis.

3.2. Weighted cross-correlation

Using cross-correlation we can measure correlation coeﬃcients between the two time series
(light curves) corresponding to diﬀerent time lags. The best time lag value can be obtained corre-
sponding to maximum correlation coeﬃcient (Peterson 2001). Traditionally cross-correlation uses
Pearson correlation coeﬃcient, ρ, which reﬂects the linear dependency by a value between −1 to
+1 (Wasserman 2004). In practice the sample correlation coeﬃcient, rxy is employed to estimate

the ρxy,

where xi, yi, (i = 1, 2, .., n) are data samples (from two light curves in our case of study) with
sample means ¯x and ¯y (Peterson 2001).
In above equation all of the sample data points have
the equal contribution in correlation coeﬃcient while the importance of the data epochs could
diﬀer depending on their uncertainties. To improve our analysis, we utilize the sample weighted
correlation coeﬃcient which estimates the correlation coeﬃcient with assigning the weights wi to
the sample data elements. The sample weighted correlation coeﬃcient is given by

can be normalized to one,

wi = 1 (da Costa 2011). In Section 3.3 we show how we include the

error of the data in time delay analysis by using Equation 4 with normalized weight equivalent to
inverse of the variance of the data.

i=1

In implementing cross-correlation in our analysis we should note two more important issues. As
we discussed previously in (Aghamousa & Shaﬁeloo 2015), correlation coeﬃcient is invariant under
linear transformation of variables (Wasserman 2004) and this property helps to tackle possible
microlensing eﬀects on data segments which we discuss in more details in Section 3.3. Another
important issue in using cross-correlation in our case of study is about the number of data points
involved in calculations (overlapped region between the two light curves). Obviously estimated
correlation coeﬃcients coming from less number of data epochs result to lower credibility. We will
consider this fact in order to increase the reliability of the time delay estimation in our analysis.

3.3. Time delay estimation

We utilize the smoothing method introduced in Section 3.1 to obtain the smooth ﬁts As, Bs
corresponding to light curves A and B respectively for a speciﬁc ∆ value (Figure 1). Since there
are no data in the gaps between the data segments we ignore the smooth ﬁt in gap regions and
only consider the smooth ﬁts corresponding to data segments.

To compare the light curves we calculate the weighted cross-correlation (Equation 4) of one light

– 7 –

curve with the smooth ﬁt of the another one. To include the error of the data we choose the weight
terms wi equal to inverse variance of data points i.e. wi = 1/σ2
i (σi is the associated error of ith
data point)2. Therefore for each data segment we can compute the weighted correlation coeﬃcient
versus time lag (Figure 2; plots 1 and 2). Then we calculate the average correlation coeﬃcient by
adding correlation coeﬃcients corresponding to each time lag (from all data segments) and divide
it by the number of segments. The maximum average correlation will be corresponded to our best
time delay estimation (Figure 2; plots 3 and 4). In this work we follow (Aghamousa & Shaﬁeloo
2015) in assigning 0.6 as an acceptance limit for the value of the correlation coeﬃcient. In other
words, if the maximum average correlation coeﬃcient become less than 0.6 we consider our method
disqualiﬁed to attain a reliable time delay estimation for the case of study. The acceptance limit of
0.6 was suggested in (Aghamousa & Shaﬁeloo 2015) after analyzing many simulated data samples
with the criteria of having zero outliers in time delay estimation.

Applying this procedure on the light curve data A, B and corresponding smooth ﬁts As, Bs
leads to two average correlation curves versus time lag. One is obtained by comparing B light
curve data and As smooth ﬁt and the second one from A light curve data and Bs smooth ﬁt
which yield to two best time lag values ˜∆tAsB and ˜∆tBsA that are illustrated in Figure 2, plots 3
and 4 respectively. Theoretically both average correlation curves must show the similar trend of
correlation coeﬃcient values but in opposite direction with respect to time delay axes such that the
best time lag values ˜∆tAsB and ˜∆tBsA should have close absolute values with opposite sign3.

Using these results we propose two diﬀerent procedures/estimators for the time delay estima-
tion. The mean time delay estimator takes simply the mean value of | ˜∆tAsB| and | ˜∆tBsA| as the
estimated time delay.

| ˜∆tAsB| + | ˜∆tBsA|

where ˜∆t

AB is the mean time delay estimation which has the sign same as ˜∆tAsB.

The similar trends in both average correlation curves lead us to an alternative estimator. We
add the average correlation curves considering the inverse time axis and divide the result by 2
to obtain an overall average correlation versus time. We call this estimator as mirror time delay
estimator, ˜∆t

of light curves A and B.

We have mentioned the number of data points involved in correlation coeﬃcient calculation
determines the reliability of the correlation estimation. In other words we cannot trust the esti-
mated correlation coeﬃcient corresponding to very few number of data points in overlapped region.
Therefore, in order to ensure the reliability of our results we consider a cut-oﬀ criterion ncut such
that the estimated correlation coeﬃcients yielded from less than ncut data points would be omitted

from the analysis. We try to estimate a reliable range of ncut using simulations. All considered, we
have two time delay estimators (mean and mirror time delay estimators), with dependency on two
parameters: smoothing width ∆ and number of data points ncut. These two tuning parameters can
aﬀect the performance of the estimators and for each set of data we should ﬁnd their optimal range
of values using simulations. For this purpose in the next section we use Monte Carlo simulations
along with implementation of a well known statistical merit condition to ﬁnd the optimum range
of these tuning parameters.

Apart from discussed statistical issues, microlensing is another concern in time delay estimation
which can cause distortion in the light curves data. In our analysis the light curves are compared
in segments of data where we considered microlensing eﬀect can be assumed as the linear distortion
in diﬀerent segments. This is very important point in our approach since the correlation coeﬃcient
is unchanged under linear transformation (Section 3.2). TDC1 blind analysis conﬁrmed this point
(analysis of the rung 4 of the data). With these in mind, we expect microlensing can not aﬀect our
time delay analysis in our case of study and this is an important advantage in this methodology.

3.4. Optimum time delay estimator

The functionalities of time delay estimators introduced in previous section depend on ∆ and
ncut values. The eﬃciency of proposed estimators can be increased by tuning these parameters.
The optimum estimator is the one that performs with highest eﬃciency. The Mean Squared Error
(MSE) is a well known statistical merit function which can gauge the quality of particular estimator.
Statistically the MSE measures the average squared distance between (unknown) true value and
estimated value. The MSE of an estimator, ˆθ , is deﬁned as:

MSE = E(ˆθ − θ)2

(6)

where θ is true value which is going to be estimated. Evidently the estimator with lower MSE can
oﬀer closer estimation to true value in average and hence owns higher eﬃciency. Furthermore, it
can be easily shown that the MSE is equal to sum of squared bias and variance of corresponding
estimator, ˆθ:

(7)
where Bias(ˆθ) = E(ˆθ) − θ and Var(ˆθ) = E(ˆθ − E(ˆθ))2. We can interpret that the minimum MSE
makes an appropriate balance between bias and variance of associated estimator (bias variance
trade-oﬀ ) which implies a promising estimator (Wasserman 2004).

MSE = Bias2(ˆθ) + Var(ˆθ)

In our time delay analysis, θ and ˆθ corresponds to true and estimated time delay respectively.
While dealing with real data true time delay is unknown, a Monte Carlo simulation based on an
assumed ﬁducial time delay can be employed to obtain the distribution of time delay estimations
to derive the corresponding MSE value through Equation 6. In doing so, we are able to choose the
optimum time delay estimator and tune its parameters to infer the best time delay estimation.

delay estimation. The blue dashed lines in plots 3, 4 and 5 indicate the correlation value equals to

To generate a pair of simulated light curve data for a doubly strong lens system we ﬁrst employ
a simple Monte Carlo simulation procedure. We assume a smooth ﬁt as the true light curve and
then add the Gaussian noise according to error of the data to obtain the simulated light curve
Asim. To obtain the second simulated light curve Bsim, we move the smooth light curve in time
axes equal to assumed time delay and repeat the previous step to generate corresponding simulated
data. In Section 2 we mentioned the SDSS J1001+5027 light curves suﬀer from gaps in the data.
This causes the large uncertainty in the smooth ﬁt between the data segment regions such that the
corresponding continuous smooth ﬁt cannot be trusted to be used in the simulation. Therefore we
need a well sampled light curve data with suﬃciently small time intervals to use its corresponding
smooth ﬁt as the true light curve in simulation. To overcome this issue we employ one of the
synthetic strong lens light curve data from Time Delay Challenge I (TDC0) (Dobler et al. 2015).
The simulated light curves in one of the categories of data (rung 0) in this challenge are generated
in equispaced time epoch with one day interval. We select the light curves labeled by pair 4 in this
category which is similar to SDSS J1001+5027 light curves data and take associated smooth ﬁt as
the true ﬁt in simulation. We generate 300 pairs of simulated light curves data Asim, Bsim, with
true time delay ∆tAsimBsim = −120 days using the actual error of SDSS J1001+5027 light curves
at same time epochs. The assumption of -120 days for true time delay comes from applying our
TDC algorithm on SDSS J1001+5027 data. We should emphasize here that all simulated data in
our analysis would have the characteristics of the real SDSS J1001+5027 data (we used the same
time spacing of data epochs and error characteristics) and we used TDC0 sample just to come up
with a realistic true quasar light curve.

We apply the mean and mirror time delay estimators on simulated light curves data with
smoothing width ∆ = 8, 14, 20 days and diﬀerent values of ncut. Figure 3 illustrates the calculated
MSE values for both estimators in diﬀerent ∆ and ncut values. We can see in the range of ncut = 16
to 44, both estimators for the ∆ = 8 days show approximately a robust ﬂat region of minimum
MSE values. Despite the fact that the higher value of ncut increases the accuracy of correlation
coeﬃcient (Section 3.3), it reduces the inferential information by excluding more parts of data
segments. To this end we choose ncut = 16, the lowest value associated to minimum MSE region
in Figure 3. Ultimately the optimum mirror and mean estimators have been selected by common
tuning parameter values ∆ = 8 and ncut = 16. From our simulations we can obtain the distribution
of both estimators (Figure 4; upper panels) and we can see the both estimators show similar
statistical characteristics.

For comprehensiveness we have also employed the simulations provided by (Rathna Kumar
et al. 2013) for the SDSS J1001+5027 system since they have claimed considering various possible
systematics in the data (and hence in their simulations). These simulated light curves are generated
with diﬀerent assumed true time delays from −135.6 to −105.2 days. We repeat the previous
procedure and calculate the MSE values through Equation 6. The optimum mirror and mean
estimators occur both with ∆ = 8 and ncut = 4. Figure 4 (lower panels) depicts the distribution of
both estimators subtracting estimated time delays with respect to true time delays for the range

between −114.0 to −125.0 days.

In Section 4 we use these results to study the time delay estimation of SDSS J1001+5027

lensed system.

3.5. Error estimation

The error estimation denotes the assessment of uncertainty of an estimation. For a point
estimation like our case of study this error would be reported with an interval around the estimate
ˆθ±eu
, (where el, eu > 0). This interval which is associated with a probability ψ% is well known as
conﬁdence interval. It implies if we repeat the experiment then associated interval (a, b) captures
the true value θ in ψ% of times. It means

el

P(a ≤ θ ≤ b) ≡ ψ%

(8)
where a = ˆθ− el and b = ˆθ + eu. Usually the conﬁdence interval (a, b) is constructed such that each
wing around the ˆθ is equivalent to probability of ψ
2 %. The 68% conﬁdence interval (1-σ error bar)
for an unbiased estimator with Normal distribution would have the simple form of

However, in general to establish the ψ% conﬁdence interval for a biased estimator with a non-
Gaussian distribution we consider the expected value E(ˆθ) and an interval around it such that each
2 % of probability. Therefore corresponding estimation ˆθ occurs in this interval
side contributes ψ
with ψ% chance by deﬁnition. It means

P(cid:16)E(ˆθ) − d1 ≤ ˆθ ≤ E(ˆθ) + d2

(cid:17) ≡ ψ%

where d1, d2 > 0. By subtracting the true value and slightly manipulation we have

P(cid:16)
P(cid:16)ˆθ − d2 − (E(ˆθ) − θ) ≤ θ ≤ ˆθ + d1 − (E(ˆθ) − θ)

(E(ˆθn) − θ) − d1 ≤ ˆθn − θ ≤ (E(ˆθn) − θ) + d2

(cid:17) ≡ ψ%
(cid:17) ≡ ψ%

(11)
The last equation introduces the ψ% conﬁdence interval (a, b), where a = ˆθ − d2 − Bias(ˆθ), b =
ˆθ + d1 − Bias(ˆθ) and Bias(ˆθ) = E(ˆθ) − θ. Equivalently it presents the error of estimation in the
form of ˆθ±eu

where el = d2 + Bias(ˆθ) and eu = d1 − Bias(ˆθ).

We can see the error depends on bias term Bias(ˆθ) = E(ˆθ)− θ and d1, d2 which are determined
by distribution of estimator. In our time delay analysis through the simulations we are able to
obtain the distribution of the time delay estimators and their associated bias values. This leads to
a proper error estimation for the derived time delay. It is worth noting that although a symmetric

Using our simulations the mirror and mean estimators with ∆ = 8 and ncut = 16 have been
selected as the optimum time delay estimators (Section 3.4). Applying both estimators on lensed
quasar SDSS J1001+5027 light curve data (Section 3.3) and following error estimation procedure
explained in Section 3.5 by using distributions of estimators (Figure 4; upper panels) result in
AB = −119.8+1.8−0.8 days. This slight inconsistency can hints to-
˜∆t
ward some small possible systematics in part of the data (where our simple Monte Carlo simulations
could not account for) or alternatively we may have inaccurate error estimation of the data epochs.
On the other hand we have seen the simulated light curves by (Rathna Kumar et al. 2013) result
the optimum mirror and mean estimators with ∆ = 8 and ncut = 4 (Section 3.4). Applying them on
lensed quasar SDSS J1001+5027 light curve data (Section 3.3) and using similar procedure of error

As we see using simulated light curves by (Rathna Kumar et al. 2013) increases the error bars
of estimations mostly in negative side. This somehow reﬂects the fact that time delay estimation
of the strong lens systems can be very tricky and one has to consider many details and unknowns
in the analysis. This also show the importance of applying various algorithms on the data to check
consistency of the results. This disparity in estimations can be seen from other eﬀorts in time
delay estimation of lensed quasar SDSS J1001+5027 using diﬀerent algorithms. Figure 5 illustrates
the mirror and mean time delay estimations in comparison with ﬁve other time delay estimations
reported by (Rathna Kumar et al. 2013). We can categorized the time delay estimations using
diﬀerent algorithms around two values of −120 and −117 days which are in agreement with our
estimations. These results show the need of increasing the quality of data to have more accurate
results.

We should report here that we did some additional detailed analysis to ﬁnd out if a particular
segment of the data can be responsible for this discrepancy. We subtracted diﬀerent segments from
the data (one segment at each time) and we repeated the analysis to see the eﬀect of diﬀerent
segments on our estimated time delay values. We noticed that the second, forth and ﬁfth seg-
ments4 have the biggest contributions to our results, cutting either of them changing the estimated
values considerably. Other segments had limited eﬀects on the estimated time delays. However,
considering all these, the discrepancy between the time delay estimations from mirror and mean

estimators persisted even by using only second, forth and ﬁfth segments of the data with exactly
same values for the time delay (-117.1 and -119.8 days). One can move forward to have some more
detailed analysis in this direction concentrating on diﬀerent segments of the data individually and
look for possible systematics, however, we expect this to be beyond the scope of this work and we
leave it for future analysis.

5. Conclusion

In this paper we present an algorithm for time delay analysis of strong lensed systems applying
it on doubly lensed quasar SDSS J1001+5027. This algorithm is a modiﬁcation of our previous for-
malism introduced in (Aghamousa & Shaﬁeloo 2015) which is mainly based on iterative smoothing
and cross-correlation. Using smoothing method we obtained the smoothed light curves As, Bs of
corresponding A, B light curves having one tuning parameter ∆ (width of smoothing). We compare
then the light curves in segments by calculating weighted cross-correlation between A and Bs and
also between B and As for diﬀerent time delays. We made two improvements at this stage of the
analysis. First we utilized the weighted correlation for including the error of the data epochs and
second by deﬁning the second tuning parameter ncut we try to exclude unreliable correlation coef-
ﬁcient values calculated coming from low number of data points for a range of time delays. Finally
we have two sets of correlation coeﬃcients from comparing segments of the data and corresponding
smoothed ﬁts for each time delay. Averaging correlation values from the data segments provides
two similar trends of correlation coeﬃcient values versus time delay in opposite directions.

Having these, we propose two time delay estimators, mean and mirror estimators, that have
dependency on tuning parameters ∆ and ncut. To tune our parameters we try to minimize the
Mean Squared Error (MSE). The minimum MSE oﬀers optimum estimator by making a balance
between associated bias and variance. Using Monte Carlo simulation enables us to calculate the
MSE of estimators for diﬀerent ∆ and ncut values. For this purpose we use two diﬀerent sets of
simulated light curves. First we use simple Monte Carlo simulation based on assumed true light
curves which results the optimum mirror and mean estimators with ∆ = 8 and ncut = 16. The
other set of simulated light curves generated by (Rathna Kumar et al. 2013) results the optimum
mirror and mean estimators with ∆ = 8 and ncut = 4. In addition we elaborated a pedagogical
explanation for error estimation based on statistical characteristics of employed estimator.

data epochs. Using simulations provided by (Rathna Kumar et al. 2013) we got the same mean
estimated values (as we got using simple Monte Carlo simulations) while the uncertainties of the
estimations increased. While we got larger error bars on our estimated time delay values from our

two estimators using (Rathna Kumar et al. 2013) simulations, these two estimators show better
consistency with each other in this case (better overlap of the results). We can somehow conclude
from all these that the simulated data provided by (Rathna Kumar et al. 2013) can be a better rep-
resentation of the actual data in comparison with simple Monte Carldo simulations. The variation
in the estimated time delay for this case of study is also reﬂected in the results of other techniques
used by diﬀerent groups. We expect that increasing the quality of the light curves will deﬁnitely
results in more consistent time delay estimations that can be essential for application in cosmology.
