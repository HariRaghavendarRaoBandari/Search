THE GALOIS COACTION ON φ4 PERIODS

ERIK PANZER AND OLIVER SCHNETZ

Abstract. We report on calculations of Feynman periods of primitive log-
divergent φ4 graphs up to eleven loops. The structure of φ4 periods is described
by a series of conjectures. In particular, we discuss the possibility that φ4
periods are a comodule under the Galois coaction. Finally, we compare the
results with the periods of primitive log-divergent non-φ4 graphs up to eight
loops and ﬁnd remarkable diﬀerences to φ4 periods. Explicit results for all
periods we could compute are provided in ancillary ﬁles.

1. Introduction

1.1. Feynman periods. Let G be a connected graph. The graph polynomial of G
is deﬁned by associating a variable xe to every edge e of G and setting (see [6, 14])
(1.1)

ΨG(x) := X

Y

xe,

T span. tree

e /∈T

where the sum is over all spanning trees T of G. We say that G is a φ4 graph when
all its vertices have degree at most four. Moreover, a graph G is called primitive
log-divergent if

NG = 2hG and
Nγ > 2hγ

for all non-empty strict subgraphs γ of G,

(1.2)

where hγ denotes the number of loops (ﬁrst Betti number) and Nγ the number of
edges in a graph γ. Whenever condition (1.2) holds, the Feynman period of the
graph G (not necessarily φ4) is deﬁned by the convergent integral [4, 43, 56]

In this way, P deﬁnes a map from the set of primitive log-divergent graphs to positive
real numbers. In φ4 quantum ﬁeld theory these numbers are renormalization scheme
independent contributions to the β-function [38]. Let

(cid:8)P(G): G primitive log-divergent and φ4(cid:9) ⊆

Pφ4 := linQ
Plog := linQ {P(G): G primitive log-divergent} ⊂ P

denote the Q-vector spaces spanned by primitive log-divergent periods. They are
subspaces of the Q-algebra P of periods in the sense of Kontsevich and Zagier [40].1
We obtain ﬁnite-dimensional subspaces if we restrict the loop order of the graphs,

P•,≤n := linQ {P(G): h1(G) ≤ n}

for φ4 graphs or general primitive log-divergent graphs G, respectively.

1Periods are those numbers which can be written as integrals of rational functions over domains

deﬁned by polynomial inequalities (with all coeﬃcients in Q).

Figure 1. The zig-zag graphs with ﬁve and with six loops.

The ﬁrst systematic study of φ4 periods (up to seven loops) was done with exact
numerical methods in 1995 by D. Broadhurst and D. Kreimer [11, 12]. Later, this
method was extended to eight loops [51].

The only all order result in φ4 theory is that periods of the zig-zag graphs (see

Figure 1) are rational multiples of the Riemann zeta function at odd integers.
Theorem 1.1 (F. Brown and O. Schnetz [24], conjectured in [11]). For every
integer n ≥ 3, the period of the zig-zag graph Zn is given by

P(Zn) = 4 (2n − 2)!
n!(n − 1)!

(1.4)

The zig-zag periods are the only known φ4 periods which are rational multiples of
values of the Riemann zeta function at integer argument. A large class of φ4 periods
(but not all φ4 periods) evaluate to multiple zeta values (MZVs), i.e. rational linear
combinations of the integer-indexed (d, n1, . . . , nd ∈ N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}) nested sums
(1.5)

ζ(n) = ζ(nd, . . . , n2, n1) := X

with nd ≥ 2.

We refer to d as the depth of the sum while n1 + n2 + . . . + nd is called its weight.
The sums (1.5) obey many Q-linear relations and span the Q-algebra2

(1.6)

Z = linQ {ζ(nd, . . . , n1): nd ≥ 2}
of MZVs. Conjecturally, MZVs are graded by the weight.

Feynman periods, and Pφ4 in particular, are interesting because they are very
sparse and appear to be constrained in several non-trivial ways. For example, no
Feynman graph is known to evaluate to the simplest zeta value of all:
Conjecture 1.2. ζ(2) is not a φ4 period: ζ(2) /∈ Pφ4.3

Similarly, no products of the form ζ(2)ζ(2n + 1) are expected in Pφ4. It thus
appears that Z ∩ Pφ4 is a small subspace of Z. Below we will also report on results
for Feynman periods which (conjecturally) do not belong to Z, but still obey highly
non-trivial constraints. The aim of this article is to oﬀer an explanation of these
phenomena (see Conjecture 1.3).
1.2. Galois theory for periods. The most remarkable property of periods is that
there should exist a Galois theory of periods [1], extending the classical Galois theory
of algebraic numbers to the bigger space P. This construction rests on standard, but
very diﬃcult transcendence conjectures.4 To bypass this problem, one can deﬁne
a Q-algebra P m of motivic periods, which are enriched avatars of period integrals

2There exist two weight-homogeneous product formulas in Z, see [37] for example.
3In fact, we expect ζ(2) /∈ Plog and even more generally, that ζ(2) /∈ P0,0 in Section 1.3.
4For example, π and the numbers ζ(2n + 1) are expected to be algebraically independent over

the rationals, but ζ(3) is the only odd Riemann zeta value which is known to be irrational [2].

THE GALOIS COACTION ON φ4 PERIODS

∆: P m −→ P dr ⊗ P m

like (1.3), see [20]. It comes with a surjective homomorphism per: P m −→ P whose
injectivity is the remaining conjecture. The powerful gain is a well-deﬁned coaction
(1.7)
which turns P m into a comodule over the Hopf algebra P dr of de Rham periods [20].
The Galois group is dual to P dr and so (1.7) encodes the action of this group on
P m. For the motivic multiple zeta values ζ m(n) deﬁned in [15] this coaction can be
computed explicitly, see (2.3). The interpretation of the examples (n ≥ 1)
∆ζ m(2) = 1⊗ ζ m(2)
and ∆ζ m(2n + 1) = ζ dr(2n + 1)⊗ 1 + 1⊗ ζ m(2n + 1) (1.8)
is that this action is trivial on ζ m(2), but ζ m(2n + 1) has 1 as a (non-trivial) Galois
conjugate. We remove the trivial term 1 ⊗ x from ∆x in the reduced coaction

∆0x = ∆x − 1 ⊗ x,

(1.9)
such that ∆0ζ m(2) = 0 and ∆0ζ m(2n+1) = ζ dr(2n+1)⊗1. The main subject of this
article is to study the coaction on P m
φ4, motivic versions of Feynman periods (see
Section 1.3). Surprisingly, the entirety of our data supports the following conjecture.
Conjecture 1.3. The Galois coaction closes on φ4 periods:

∆: P m

φ4 −→ P dr ⊗ P m
φ4 ,

(Scenario 1)
which means that all Galois conjugates of a φ4 period are also φ4 periods. Also, the
data is consistent with a grading by loop number, if one allows for non-φ4 graphs:
(Scenario 2)
). Therefore
the zig-zag series from Theorem 1.1 is trivially consistent with both scenarios.
However, we already obtain strong constraints on P m
φ4 if we assume Conjecture 1.2:
Because ζ dr(2n + 1) 6= 0 and

By (1.8) the only non-trivial conjugate of odd zeta values is 1 = P(

Our data rules out the possibility ∆0 : P m

Scenario 1 implies that ζ m(2)ζ m(2n + 1) /∈ P m
φ4 for every n ≥ 1. In Section 1.5
we give striking examples of non-MZV φ4 periods that obey the highly restrictive
Conjecture 1.3. In Table 4 we show the Galois conjugates of all known φ4 periods
with ≤ 8 loops, expressed as linear combinations of φ4 periods. MapleTM readable
ﬁles with all known data are attached to this article, see Section 6.5 The labeling of
periods refers to these ﬁles and is consistent with [51].
φ4,≤n−1, because some
8-loop periods, like P8,17, have Galois conjugates which are not in Pφ4,≤7 but require
the 8-loop period P8,16 (see Table 4). Similarly, ∆0 : P m
log,≤n−1 is
excluded by (5.6).
1.3. Motivic Feynman periods. A construction of motivic Feynman periods goes
back to [4, 14] and was considerably generalized in [19]. To a graph G one can
associate a ﬁnite dimensional Q-vector space P m(G), see [19, in particular section 9],
which consists of (motivic versions of) all integrals of the form

where k ≥ 1 is an integer and q(x) ∈ Z[x1, . . . , xNG−1] can be any polynomial such
that the integral converges. In this setting, the coaction conjecture is proven:6

(1.10), see [19] for details on these non-global periods.

7A restriction to φ4 graphs and/or primitive log-divergent graphs is insigniﬁcant here, because
every graph is a minor of some primitive log-divergent φ4 graph [14, Lemma 11] and the spaces
P m(G) are minor monotone (this is not trivial; the proof in [14, Proposition 37] is not motivic).

φ4 are the same.

∆: P m(G) −→ P dr ⊗ P m(G),

(1.11)
in other words, the Galois group acts on P m(G). Following the notation of [19], we
write P m0,0 for the space spanned by all P m(G) for any7 graph G. Then (1.11) partly
explains Conjecture 1.3 because surprisingly, experiments suggest that at low loop
orders P m0,0 and P m

However, this situation changes at high loop orders: At eight loops we have
non-φ4
periods of non-φ4 graphs (e.g. P
8,218 ) which are not expected
in φ4. More evidence comes from the c2-invariant which seems strongly constrained
for φ4 periods (see Section 1.4). In general, we expect that P m

hence also in P m0,0. Regretfully, we have so far no information about how P m
log relates
to P m0,0 (except for inclusion).
1.4. The c2-invariant. Since (1.1) is deﬁned over the integers, it deﬁnes an aﬃne
scheme of ﬁnite type over Spec Z which is called the graph hypersurface XG ⊂ ANG.
For any ﬁeld k, we can therefore consider the zero locus XG(k) of ΨG in kNG. Using
the ﬁnite ﬁelds k ∼= Fq of order q, this determines the point-counting function

[XG]: q 7→ [XG]q := #XG(Fq) ∈ N0

(1.12)
as a map from the set of prime powers q = pn to non-negative integers. Inspired by
the occurrence of MZVs in Pφ4, Kontsevich rised the question if [XG] is a polynomial
in q [39]. While for graphs with at most 13 edges this is true [52, 54], it is known that
[XG] is of general type [3] and fails to be polynomial even for φ4 graphs [23, 30, 52].
For every graph with at least three vertices, [XG]q is divisible by q2 [52]. This

suggests
Deﬁnition 1.4. Let G have at least three vertices. The c2-invariant [52] associates

to G an inﬁnite sequence inQ

q=pn Z/qZ by

c2(G)q := [XG]q/q2 mod q.

(1.13)
By experiment [52] it is expected that for many graphs the c2-invariant is the
most complicated part of the point-counting function [XG]. Recent work [21, 22, 52]
showed that it captures some information about the period (1.3); in particular it is
conjectured in [22] that graphs with identical period have the same c2-invariant.

Following [3], one might expect c2-invariants of graphs to be arbitrarily compli-
cated. Experiments up to ten loops in [23], however, suggest that c2-invariants of
φ4 graphs are very restricted; in small dimensions we see only few geometries:
1.4.1. quasi-constants. Many c2-invariants count points on zero-dimensional varieties.
In this case they are called quasi-constant because there exist an m ∈ N and a
unique c ∈ Z such that c2(G)pnm ≡ c mod pnm for all n ∈ N and all but ﬁnitely
many primes p. We only know cases when c = 0 and c = −1. In fact, so far only ﬁve
quasi-constant c2-invariants were found in φ4 theory: The constants 0,−1 and the

primitive roots of unity in Fq:

if gcd(N, q) > 1, and
otherwise.

(1.14)

We say that a graph G has weight drop if c2(G) ≡ 0 mod q for all q. This property
is linked to the weight of its period: In the case that P(G) is an MZV, its weight is
at most 2hG − 3. If G has weight drop then it is conjectured (and proved in some
cases [25]) that P(G) has at most weight 2hG − 4.
The c2-invariant −1 indicates an MZV period of pure maximum weight (Con-
jecture 5.12) whereas the periods of quasi-constant c2 = −zN are MPLs of pure
maximum weight at Nth roots of unity by Conjectures 5.14 and 5.16.

1.4.2. modular forms. In φ4 theory, non-quasi-constant c2-invariants seem to come
from geometries of dimensions greater than or equal to two. Only three two-
dimensional geometries are found in φ4 theory up to ten loops. These are of K3
type and modular with respect to modular forms of weight and level (3,7), (3,8),
and (3,12) [22, 23].

The number of geometries of φ4 c2-invariants seem to increase with the dimension.
The ﬁrst non-modular varieties are expected at nine loops and four dimensions [23].
The c2-invariant is (at least for small primes p) known for all φ4 periods up to ten
loops and all non-φ4 periods up to nine loops [23].

With present technology, periods of graphs with non-quasi-constant c2-invariant
cannot be calculated. Hence, all periods we consider in this article come from graphs
with quasi-constant c2.
1.5. Results. In the subsequent analysis of φ4 periods we assume the standard
transcendence conjecture that per: P m −→ P is an isomorphism. This means that
we compute the real numbers P(G) ∈ P analytically in terms of, say, real MZVs and
subsequently apply the coaction formula (2.3) for motivic MZVs (see Remark 4.1).8
We succeeded in calculating all 17 φ4 periods up to seven loops and 23 out of at
most 31 φ4 periods at eight loops. Beyond eight loops we were still able to calculate
an increasing number of periods which however are out-counted by the quickly
increasing number of all φ4 periods: At nine loops we know 47 out of at most 134
periods, at ten loops we know 88 out of at most 846 periods and at eleven loops we
know 125 out of at most 6300 periods. The list of non-φ4 periods is also complete
up to seven loops. At eight loops it was possible to calculate most non-φ4 periods.
One long sought-after period is P7,11 in the nomenclature of [51] (see Figure 2; we
use the name P7,11 for the graph as well as for its period). It is the ﬁrst (conjectured)
non-MZV φ4 period. It can be expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms (MPLs)
at sixth roots of unity. To make the coaction easily visible, we express our results
in a suitable f-alphabet of non-commutative words, a construction which we will
recall in Section 2.4. It allows us to represent periods with abstract words (elements

8This is well-deﬁned only conjecturally, because there could be additional relations between
MZVs which are not shared by motivic MZVs, making the replacement ζ(n) 7→ ζm(n) ambiguous.

in a tensor algebra) such that the coaction simply becomes deconcatenation. For
example, motivic MZVs correspond to words in letters of odd weight ≥ 3, see [16]:
(1.15)
Deligne gave bases for MPLs at Nth roots of unity in the cases N ∈ {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}
in [28] (see Section 2.3) which lead to f-alphabets for these periods. These have
additional letters (compared to MZVs).

Z m ∼= Qhf3, f5,···i ⊗ Q[π2].

Because many φ4 periods (in particular all of loop order at most six) are MZVs
it is convenient to use an f-alphabet in which the subspace of MZVs is spanned
by the pre-images of words in letters of odd weight greater than or equal to three.
Deligne’s original basis does not have this property. We prove in Theorem 3.7 that
taking real parts if the weight plus the depth of the basis element is even and i×
imaginary parts otherwise leads to a basis that embeds MZVs in the natural way.

Note that the f-alphabet is not fully canonical, see e.g. (5.8) for an alternative
representation. The presence of large numerators and denominators reﬂects a certain
lack of economy of the modiﬁed Deligne basis for expressing Feynman periods (the
coeﬃcients are even larger in the f-alphabet with respect to Deligne’s original basis).
The construction of a better adapted basis is discussed in [10].

So, for all known periods Scenario 2 is true. For Scenario 1 we miss Q12,5 in the
space of known φ4 periods. Assuming Scenario 1 and combining all conjectures on
the structure of φ4 periods (see Section 5) we can localize Q12,5 in the period of a
single ten loop graph: P10,425, see Conjecture 5.18. Regretfully, the period of this
graph cannot yet be calculated. Scenario 1 holds for all known graphs of at most
eight loops. This is explicit in Table 4 at the end of this article. Text ﬁles with all
known data are attached to this article and also described in Section 6.
Conjecturally, we know all mixed-Tate periods in Pφ4 up to weight 11, see

Section 5.6. Assuming Scenario 1 we ﬁnd the dimensions shown in Table 1.

In Section 5 we give a series of conjectures on the structure of Pφ4. By counter-
examples we prove that some of these conjectures are false in Plog. This gives a
remarkable diﬀerence between Pφ4 and Plog. We conclude that there possibly exists
a structure which is only present in Pφ4. Mathematically it is not yet clear what
mechanism distinguishes φ4 periods from periods of all graphs. Finally we discuss
potential counter-examples to Conjecture 1.3 in Sections 5.10 and 5.11.

As the coaction theorem, Eq. (1.11), for general Feynman periods also applies
to Feynman periods with masses and momenta [19], our ﬁndings related to the
β-function of φ4 give hope that one might ﬁnd similarly remarkable structures in
other physical observables, such as g − 2.

2. Iterated integrals and multiple zeta values

2.1. Iterated integrals. In [27] Chen developed a theory of iterated path inte-
gration on general manifolds. Here, we need only the elementary one-dimensional
case of a punctured sphere C \ Σ for some ﬁnite set Σ ⊂ C. Fix a weight n ∈ N,
a path γ : [0, 1] −→ C \ Σ from a0 = γ(0) to an+1 = γ(1) and diﬀerential forms
ωi(z) := dz/(z − ai) with ai ∈ Σ for i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}. Then, the iterated integral of
the word an. . . a1 (considering Σ as an alphabet) along γ is deﬁned by
γ∗ωn(tn) ∧ . . . ∧ γ∗ω1(t1),

(2.1)
where the integration simplex is endowed with the standard orientation and γ∗ωi is
the pullback of ωi along γ. Iterated path integrals have the following properties:

I(an+1, an . . . a1, a0)γ =

1>tn>···>t1>0

Z

I0: I(a1, a0)γ = 1 (by deﬁnition).
I1: I(an+1, w, a0)γ depends only on the homotopy class of γ.
I2: I(a0, w, a0)γ = 0 for the constant path γ(t) = a0 and non-empty words w.
I3: Path reversal: For the reversed path γ−1(t) = γ(1 − t),

I(an+1, an . . . a1, a0)γ−1 = (−1)nI(a0, a1 . . . an, an+1)γ.

9The weight is only a ﬁltration on P m, but becomes a grading in this very special case of
polylogarithms. Note that our weights are half the Hodge-theoretic weights; see [20] for details.

I6: Chain rule: Every Möbius transformation f maps a word w by pull-back
of the diﬀerential forms ωi to a linear combination f∗w of words in the
alphabet f−1(Σ ∪ {∞}) \ {∞}. The iterated integral transforms as

I(f(an+1), w, f(a0))f(γ) = I(an+1, f∗w, a0)γ,

where the iterated integral on the right hand side is linearly extended to
linear combination of words.

Although by deﬁnition one assumes a0, an+1 /∈ Σ, it is possible by a limiting
procedure to deﬁne iterated integrals for the singular cases a0, an+1 ∈ Σ. See [44]
for a detailed discussion of iterated integrals in this special setup.
We only consider straight paths. Due to I1 we suppress the subscript γ. As a
special case we obtain the multiple polylogarithms (MPLs) from [35] in the form

By (1.5), iterated integrals over the letters Σ = {0, 1} are MZVs. In this article
we also need MPLs at other roots of unity. In particular, we consider the three-letter
alphabet Σ = {0, 1, exp(2πi/N)} for N ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}. In the case of alternating
sums N = 2 a basis was ﬁrst conjectured by D. Broadhurst [7]. The more general
case was treated by P. Deligne in [28].

2.2. Motivic iterated integrals. One can deﬁne motivic iterated integrals I m(a)
which share the above axioms and evaluate to the ordinary iterated integrals under
per (I m(a)) = I(a), see [15, 18, 33] for details. While questions of transcendentality
and Q-linear independence are extremely hard for ordinary iterated integrals, they
are (for some geometries) perfectly understood and proven in the motivic setup.
In particular, it is only possible to prove dimension formulae like Corollary 2.2 for
motivic objects. Moreover, strictly speaking, the coaction exists only for motivic
iterated integrals. In order to get a well-deﬁned push-forward to a coaction on
ordinary iterated integrals, we need the conjectured injectivity of the evaluation
map per. In the following we (tacitly) work with motivic iterated integrals.

A formula for the Galois coaction on (motivic) iterated integrals was found by A.

where the sum is over indices satisfying i0 = 0 and ik+1 = n + 1. On the left hand
side of the tensor product, I dr(. . .) is the image of the projection of I(. . .) onto the
factor algebra of iterated integrals modulo the ideal generated by 2πi.10
2.3. The Deligne basis. In [15] F. Brown proves that MZVs in 2s and 3s form a
basis of (motivic) MZVs (the Hoﬀman basis). In 1996 D. Broadhurst conjectured a
basis for alternating sums [7]. This conjecture was ﬁrst proved by P. Deligne [28],
who also considers MPLs at some other roots of unity (for alternative proofs based
on (2.3), see C. Glanois [33]). For N ∈ {2, 3, 4, 6} let us deﬁne the alphabets XN by

{1, 3, 5, 7, . . .}

Theorem 2.1 (P. Deligne [28]). Let N ∈ {2, 3, 4, 6}, ξN = exp(2πi/N), and ZN be
the Q-algebra generated by motivic iterated integrals in the letters {0, 1, ξN}. Let
νN be 2 if N = 2 and 1 otherwise. Then, the algebra ZN is freely generated by the

words [48]. Therefore, ZN is isomorphic to linQ[(2πi)νN ] X∗
By counting the words in each weight, we obtain the following dimensions:
Corollary 2.2. Let dN,n be the dimension of the subspaces of ZN at weight n.
If N ∈ {2, 6} then dN,n is the Fibonacci sequence dN,n+2 = dN,n+1 + dN,n with
dN,0 = dN,1 = 1. If N ∈ {3, 4} then dN,n = 2n.
Remark 2.3. In fact, Deligne proved more: If N ∈ {2, 3, 4}, then ZN already
particular, ZN is closed under complex conjugation (this also holds for N = 6):

N , k = 0, . . . , N − 1(cid:9). In

ZN = ReZN ⊕ i Im ZN = (ZN ∩ R) ⊕ (ZN ∩ iR).

(2.5)
Furthermore, Deligne showed that the basis DN is optimal with respect to the depth
ﬁltration: If we set the depth of 2πi to zero, then any x ∈ ZN which is a linear
combination of iterated integrals of depth ≤ d (at most d letters are non-zero) can
be written in terms of the basis DN using words of total depth ≤ d.

10It is not clear if this picture of de Rham periods generalizes to more complicated Feynman
graphs. According to [20, Section 4.3], such a representation via a projection of motivic periods
works only for separated graphs [19, Section 9.2]. It is yet unknown which graphs have this property.

∼= UN are isomorphic as graded comodules, i.e. the weight gradings
Crucially, ZN
are compatible and the formula (2.3) for the coaction on ZN simpliﬁes to (2.9) on
UN. This is the reason why we present all results in the f-alphabet. The Galois
conjugates, relevant for Conjecture 1.3, are easy to read oﬀ in UN.
An explicit construction of such an isomorphism ψB : ZN −→ UN depends on
the choice of an algebra basis B of ZN and is explained in detail in [16]. In short,
the construction goes as follows: First note that ψB should be multiplicative, so
we only need to specify ψB(b) for basis elements b ∈ B. We always assume that B
contains (2πi)νN and set ψB((2πi)νN ) = (2πi)νN , i.e. ψB is linear over Q[(2πi)νN ].
Furthermore, for each weight n ∈ XN there should be precisely one primitive basis
element bn ∈ B of this weight. It is mapped to ψB(bn) := f N
n . By primitive we
mean (cid:56)∆0 bn = 0 for the twice reduced coaction (compare with (1.9))

N −→ Z dr

(cid:56)∆0 x := ∆x − 1 ⊗ x − xdr ⊗ 1,

N (or UN −→ U dr

(2.10)
where x 7→ xdr denotes the projection Z m
N ) onto the quotient
by (2πi)νN . Finally, the image ψB(b) of all remaining (non-primitive) basis elements
is recursively determined by the requirement that (cid:56)∆0 ψB(b) = (ψB ⊗ ψB) (cid:56)∆0 b. This
ﬁxes ψB(b) up to an element of the kernel (2πi)nQ ⊕ f N
n Q of (cid:56)∆0 if b has weight n.
The convention is that the coeﬃcients of (2πi)n and f N
n in ψB(b) are zero.
For an arbitrary period x ∈ ZN, its image ψB(x) ∈ UN can be computed by
the decomposition algorithm from [16]. It exploits the same recursion via (cid:56)∆0 and
determines the coeﬃcients of the primitives by an exact numeric algorithm. This
method is very eﬃcient and we used a computer implementation which is part of
the program [50].

Let us illustrate the procedure in the case of MZVs (N = 1) where we choose for
B the basis given in the MZV-datamine [5]. This basis contains all odd Riemann
zeta values, ζ(2n + 1) ∈ B, which are primitive by (1.8) and hence mapped to
ψB(ζ(2n + 1)) = f2n+1. The ﬁrst non-primitive basis element is ζ(5, 3) ∈ B. Using
(2.3) we ﬁnd (cid:56)∆0 ζ(5, 3) = −5ζ dr(5) ⊗ ζ(3). Applying ψ to this equation shows

ERIK PANZER AND OLIVER SCHNETZ

12
that ψ(ζ(5, 3)) = −5f5f3 (the constraint from (cid:56)∆0 alone would allow us to add any
rational multiple of (2πi)8, but the convention is not to do so).
To lighten notation we identify elements of the f-alphabets UN with their preim-
ages in ZN, e.g. in (1.16)–(1.19) and in Section 5. The dependence on the basis B is
thereby suppressed (only N can be read-oﬀ from the f-alphabet); our convention is
to use the datamine for MZVs, Deligne’s basis for N = 2 and a modiﬁed Deligne basis
(see Theorem 3.7 and (3.8)) for the cases N ≥ 3. These bases are very convenient as
we will discuss in detail in Section 3. In Table 2 we show the diﬀerent f-alphabet
expressions ψB(ζ(3)) and ψB(ζ(5, 3)) for various bases B.
Remark 2.4. Although for N > 1 the alphabets FN of the f-alphabet and XN
of Deligne’s basis are essentially the same, the isomorphism ψ drastically changes
the formula for the coaction and is hence a non-trivial map. An expression for
periods in terms of multiple polylogarithms (Deligne’s basis) can in fact become
very lengthy even in cases where the f-alphabet seems relatively simple (compare
[44, Equation (5.1.10)] with (1.16)).
2.5. The derivation δm. For some practical applications the coaction is unnecces-
sarily complicated. In the f-alphabet it is clear that we obtain the same information
on a word w by clipping oﬀ its leftmost letter [16].
Deﬁnition 2.5. For N ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 6} and m ∈ N the linear map δm : UN −→ UN
is deﬁned as follows: Given any element w(2πi)kνN of UN (w ∈ F ∗
N, k ∈ N0), set
m u begins with f N

(cid:0)w(2πi)kνN(cid:1) :=

m , and

(2.11)

δm

if w = f N
otherwise.

By (2.8), the map δ is a derivation for the shuﬄe product
δm(v x w) = (δmv) x w + v x (δmw).

(2.12)
By slight abuse of notation we also write δm for the analogous derivation on U dr as
well as for ψ−1 ◦ δm ◦ ψ acting on ZN and on Z dr
N .
Note that the map δm : ZN −→ ZN depends on the choice of an algebra basis in
ZN. A formula that reduces the calculation of δm on weight n iterated integrals
(n > m) to lower weights has signiﬁcantly less terms than the full coaction (2.3):

3. The parity basis

For all N ∈ {2, 3, 4, 6}, the Q-algebra Z of MZVs is a natural sub-algebra of
ZN. This becomes particularily important in φ4 theory where all periods up to six
loops are MZVs. In the f-alphabet MZVs are described by the letters F1 of odd
weight greater than or equal to three (1.15). Consistently, letters of these weights
exist in the f-alphabet of ZN for all N ∈ {2, 3, 4, 6}. It is natural to ask if we can
ﬁnd algebra bases BN for ZN such that under ψB, words in odd letters f N2n+1 with
n ≥ 1 in combination with even powers of 2πi correspond to MZVs: ψ−1
(U) = Z
for U ⊂ UN.

is not an MZV. Conversely, MZVs are mapped to expressions which include odd
powers of 2πi and even weight letters (see Table 2).
One way to obtain the desired natural embedding U ⊂ UN as the image under
ψBN of Z ⊂ ZN is to choose a basis BN which contains an algebra basis of Z, e.g.
the datamine basis. However, it is very diﬃcult to explicitly write down suitable
generators of ZN viewed as an algebra over Z. This problem of Galois descents is
studied in [32, 33], but only for N = 2 an explicit algebra basis for Z in ZN has
been given. Here, we take a diﬀerent approach to achieve the desired embedding
U ⊂ UN: We exploit the parity under complex conjugation z 7→ z∗. Let us ﬁrst
review the situation in depth one:
Lemma 3.1. For n, N ∈ N and every N th root of unity ξNsuch that (n, ξN) 6=
(1, 1), either the real- or the imaginary part of Lin(ξN) is a rational multiple of
(2πi)n:

Lin(ξN) + (−1)n Lin(ξ∗

Lin(−x) + (−1)n Lin(−1/x) = −(2πi)n

Proof. This is a special case of the inversion formula [42, Equation (7.20)],

where the Bernoulli polynomials Bn(x) are deﬁned by text
and
log denotes the principle branch of the logarithm. (An inductive proof is to verify
that both sides deﬁne functions fn(x) that solve x∂xfn(x) = fn−1(x) and to check
the limits n = 1 and x = −1.)

For example, setting x = ξ6 and N = 2 we ﬁnd 21−n Lin(ξ3) = Lin(ξ∗
3) + Lin(ξ6)
which implies the last two equations from the previous ones (see also [42, Equations
(cid:3)
(7.43) and (7.47)]).

This observation shows that in depth one we have a very simple embedding of
MZVs into ZN by taking the real parts of Lin(ξN). In order to generalize these
results to arbitrary depths, we introduce a ‘parity’ operation.
Deﬁnition 3.3. Let X ⊂ Z be an alphabet of integers and QhXi the Q vector
space spanned by words with letters in X. We deﬁne

(3.3)
for words nd . . . n1 in X∗ and extend this parity map linearly to all of QhXi. An
element w ∈ QhXi has even (odd) parity if w = w (w = −w).

nd . . . n1 := (−1)nd+...+n1+dnd . . . n1

The following parity conjecture for MZVs was proved in [17, 37, 55]:

Theorem 3.4. If the word nd . . . n1 has odd parity (and nd ≥ 2), then ζ(nd, . . . , n1)
is a rational linear combination of MZVs of depth < d:

ζ(nd, . . . , n1) ≡ 0 mod D≤d−1Z if nd + . . . + n1 + d is odd.

(cid:8)ζ k(2)ζ(nr, . . . , n1): r ≤ d(cid:9),

Here, we deﬁne the depth ﬁltration as D≤dZ := linQ

in particular, note that ζ(2) has zero depth. In fact, Theorem 3.4 also holds for
multiple polylogarithms at arbitrary roots of unity [47]. However, for the purpose
of this paper we only need the following very special case, for which we will give a
self-contained proof:
Proposition 3.5 (Generalized parity). For N ∈ {2, 3, 4, 6} let D≤dZN denote the
subspace of ZN spanned by all (2πi)kνN Lim(ξN) with depth(m) ≤ d (νN is 2 for
N = 2 and 1 otherwise). Then

Lin(ξ∗

N) − Lin(ξN) ≡ 0 mod D≤d−1ZN

(3.4)

holds for arbitrary words n ∈ N∗ (where we extend Li• by linearity).
Proof. We use (2.2). With I4 we split the integration path at 1, such that

This already implies ψ(b∗) = ψ(b), because the kernel of (cid:56)∆0 is spanned by powers
of 2πi and the letters FN, all of which occur with coeﬃcient zero in both ψ(b) and
ψ(b∗) by the construction of ψ (note b∗ = ±b). Hence, Equation (3.6) holds for all
x ∈ B. Because parity is a homomorphism for the shuﬄe product, v x w = v x w,
Equation (3.6) extends to all x ∈ ZN.
For (3.7) it suﬃces to show that ψ(Z) ⊆ U. Then, the claim follows by comparing
dimensions of given weights. We again proceed by induction over weight. The
weights 0 and 1 are trivial. Let x ∈ Z have weight n ≥ 2. The reduced coaction (cid:56)∆0
closes on MZVs. By induction we have (cid:56)∆0 ψ(x) = (ψ ⊗ ψ)((cid:56)∆0 x) ∈ U dr ⊗ U, where
U dr is spanned by words in letters of odd weight ≥ 3. Therefore x ∈ p + U for
n ⊕ Q(2πi)n. Because x is real we obtain
some primitive p of weight n, i.e. p ∈ Qf N
from (3.6) that p = p. If n is even this implies p ∈ Q(2πi)n ∈ U. If n is odd then
p ∈ Qf N
(cid:3)
Remark 3.8. Using the coaction and Lemma 3.2 we obtain the inclusions Z ⊂
Z2 ⊂ Z4 and Z ⊂ Z6 ⊂ Z3. The second part of the proof of Theorem 3.7 extends to
3(Z6) = U6 ⊂ U3 means that elements of U3 represent numbers in

Remark 3.9. Feynman periods (1.3) are deﬁned over Q, see (1.1). But when
N ∈ {3, 6}, numbers in ZN with odd parity are imaginary and not deﬁned over Q.
So instead of e.g. 2πi, we should consider a rational multiple of

4. Methods

For a long time it was not known how to calculate Feynman periods. Now we
have several methods at hand which, when combined, suﬃce to compute all periods
up to seven loops, most graphs with eight loops and several graphs with nine, ten,
or eleven loops. The method has four building blocks:

(1) parametric integration,
(2) graphical functions,
(3) generalized single-valued hyperlogarithms and
(4) the decomposition algorithm.

Parametric integration was developed by F. Brown [13, 14] and implemented by
the ﬁrst author [44, 46]. Graphical functions were deﬁned in [53]. The theory
of generalized single-valued hyperlogarithms is presently developed by the second
author [49] (ﬁrst examples are in [26]). The decomposition algorithm was suggested
by F. Brown [16] and implemented by the second author [50].

THE GALOIS COACTION ON φ4 PERIODS

17

For most periods we need all four building blocks in the following order: Firstly,
calculate a graphical function of low weight by parametric integration (using the
representation given in [34]). Secondly, derive diﬀerential equations for graphical
functions of higher weights. Thirdly, solve the diﬀerential equations by single-valued
integration in the space of generalized single-valued hyperlogarithms. Fourthly, use
the decomposition algorithm to reduce the result to a basis of ZN.
For many graphs a subset of the building blocks suﬃce: Lots of periods (like the
zig-zag series) can be calculated with the theory of graphical functions alone [24].
On the other hand, P7,11 (see Figure 2) was calculated in terms of iterated integrals
using parametric integration alone [44, Section 5.1.3]. The result was evaluated to
5 000 signiﬁcant digits and the rational coeﬃcients for its representation in the parity
basis D0
6 where provided by PSLQ [31], exhausting 3 000 digits. Note that assuming
Scenario 1 leads to an ansatz of the type (1.16) where the f 6
n are calculated by the
decomposition algorithm. So in practice, the constraints from Conjecture 1.3 vastly
reduce the dimension of the Q-vector space which (conjecturally) must contain
the period. In the case of P7,11 this means that PSLQ needed only 400 digits to
identify the rational coeﬃcients in (1.16). Explicit representations of P7,11 in terms
of iterated integrals are given in [44, Equation (5.1.10)], the attached ﬁles and most
beautifully and concisely in [10].
Remark 4.1. F. Brown recently deﬁned motivic Feynman periods I m
G for (1.3)

such that per(I m
Conjecture 1.3.12 The coaction is well-deﬁned on I m
G, which opens up the possibility
to avoid transcendence conjectures by working with motivic amplitudes throughout.
However, our methods are currently only analytic. For example, we only know13

9 ζ(9) + 8[ζ(3)]3 = per(cid:0) 1063

9 ζ m(9) + 8[ζ m(3)]3(cid:1)

(cid:17) = P6,2 = 1063

from [51] and compute the coaction of P6,2 via the right-hand side and (2.3),
assuming the (conjectural) injectivity of per. This applies to all of our results. One
could avoid this conjecture if one could show I m
9 ζ m(9) + 8[ζ m(3)]3 directly.
Some of our methods (parametric and single-valued integration) should in principle
admit a lift to the motivic level, but this would require considerable eﬀorts and it is
not clear how far this can be pushed in practice (considering that even the geometry
of very simple graphs like Zn is only partially understood [21, 29]).

Other methods, most notably the completion from Theorem 5.2, seem to be
extremely diﬃcult to understand motivically (not even the c2-invariant is known to
adhere to completion, see Conjecture 5.7).

P6,2 = 1063

5. The structure of φ4 periods

5.1. Completion. One of the fundamental properties of φ4 periods is their invari-
ance under completion.
Deﬁnition 5.1. Let G be a φ4 graph. Then, the completion G of G is the 4-regular
graph (every vertex has four edges) that is obtained from G by adding a vertex 0∞0
and four edges from vertices which have less than four edges to ∞ (see Figure 3).

12In our case of mass- and momentum free Feynman integrals, the underlying geometric

construction goes back to [4].

13We denote with P6,2 both the corresponding graph G and its period P (G).

Theorem 5.2 (Deﬁnition and Theorem 2.2 in [51]). Let G be the completion of a
primitive log-divergent φ4 graph G and v1, v2 arbitrary vertices of G. Then G \ v1
and G \ v2 are primitive log-divergent φ4 graphs with equal period,

(5.1)
A completed graph G hence represents an equivalence class of φ4 graphs with

equal period. We deﬁne P(G) := P(cid:0)G \ v(cid:1) for any vertex v of G. One can also

deﬁne completion for non-φ4 graphs if one introduces edges with negative weights.
5.2. The product identity. There exists a product formula for completed φ4
graphs. If a completed primitive φ4 graph G can be split by removing three vertices,
it is called reducible and its period factorizes (see Figure 4).
Theorem 5.3 (Theorem 2.1 in [51]). Every reducible completed primitive φ4 graph
G is the gluing of two completed primitive φ4 graphs G1 and G2 on triangle faces
followed by the removal of the triangle edges. Its period is the product

P(G) = P(G1)P(G2).

reducible graphs have weight drop.

(5.2)
Moreover, note that hG = hG1 +hG2 −1. Because the weight of P(G) is ≤ 2hG−3,
By the product identity it is clear that the Z-span of periods of completed graphs
with at least two edge-disjoint triangles forms a ring. Up to seven loops the only
graph which does not have two edge-disjoint triangles is the complete bipartite
graph K4,4. The period of K4,4 was conjectured in [11] and is now proven (P6,4 in
[51]). It is possible to express P(K4,4) as integer linear combination of periods of
graphs with at least two edge-disjoint triangles:

(5.3)
Hence, the ring generated by φ4 periods up to seven loops is contained in the Z-span
of all φ4 periods. It seems unlikely that similar equations will exist for the φ4 periods

P(K4,4) = 12P4P3 − 16P6,3.

THE GALOIS COACTION ON φ4 PERIODS

of the eight loop graphs without triangles and with modular c2-invariants. Still, the
following questions remain open:
Question 5.4. Do φ4 periods span a ring over Z? Is Pφ4 a Q-algebra?

Note that the coaction is a homomorphism with respect to multiplication, ∆(xy) =
∆(x)∆(y), thus if we assume a positive answer to the second question it is suﬃcient
to test Conjeceture 1.3 on irreducible graphs. In the case of generalized Feynman
periods P0,0, the multiplicative structure is already proven:
Theorem 5.5 ([19, Proposition 7.9]). P m0,0 is a Q-algebra.
5.3. c2-conjectures. The c2-invariant of any connected graph with at least three
vertices was deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1.4. It is conjectured that the c2-invariant is an
invariant of the period of the graph:
Conjecture 5.6 (Conjecture 5 in [22]). If P(G1) = P(G2) for two primitive
log-divergent graphs G1 and G2, then c2(G1) = c2(G2).

A weaker version of Conjecture 5.6 is the following ‘completion conjecture’.

Conjecture 5.7 (Conjecture 4 in [22]). Graphs with identical completion have
identical c2.

By slight abuse of notation we deﬁne the c2-invariant of a completed primitive
graph G as the c2-invariant of G\ v for any vertex v in G (assuming Conjecture 5.7).
In the subsequent sections we will see how the c2-invariants of primitive log-divergent
graphs aﬀect the period. The c2-invariants of primitive log-divergent φ4 graphs up
to ten loops are contained in the attached ﬁles.
5.4. The ancestor. Consider the situation that two triangles in a graph G meet
in an edge e. A double triangle reduction of G replaces a vertex of e by a crossing
such that a single triangle emerges, see Figure 5.

=⇒

Figure 5. Double triangle reduction: Replace the joint vertex
of two attached triangles by a crossing. Vertices v and w are not
allowed to be identical.

Theorem 5.8 (Propositions 2.2–2.4 in [51]). Any maximum sequence of product
reductions (see Figure 4) and double triangle reductions (see Figure 5) of a completed
primitive φ4 graph leads to the same graph which has completed primitive components.
Deﬁnition 5.9 (Assuming Conjecture 5.7). The graph (possibly with several com-
ponents) that is obtained from a completed primitive φ4 graph G by a maximum
sequence of product reductions and double triangle reductions is the ‘ancestor’ anc(G)
of G. The graph G is a ‘descendant’ of anc(G). The product of the periods of the

graph G, its completion G, the period P(G), the ancestor anc(G)

components of anc(G) is the period P of anc(G). Let G = G \ v for any vertex v in
G. If P(anc(G)) ∈ ZN[ξN] for some N (we say P(anc(G)) is mixed Tate) then the
‘weight drop’ of anc(G) is 2hG − 3 minus the maximum weight of P(anc(G)). The
c2-invariant of anc(G) is zero if anc(G) has more than one component. Otherwise
it is the c2-invariant of anc(G) \ v for any vertex v in anc(G).
Remark 5.10. The ancestor is (conjecturally) a reﬁnement of the c2-invariant:
For any primitive log-divergent graph G the c2-invariant equals the c2-invariant of
the ancestor of its completion G in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.9,

(5.4)
Assuming Conjecture 5.7, this follows from [22, Corollary 34] and [25, Proposi-
tion 36]. A proof of (5.4) which is independent of Conjecture 5.7 is still missing.

c2(G) = c2(anc(G)).

The ancestor predicts the maximum weight of a φ4 period:

Conjecture 5.11. Assume P(G) is mixed Tate for a primitive log-divergent φ4
graph G with completion G. Then, the weight drop of anc(G) exists14 and it equals
the weight drop of P(G), i.e. it equals 2hG − 3 minus the maximum weight of P(G).
Note that two graphs with equal period may have diﬀerent ancestors. The
relations between the graph, its completion, the period, the ancestor and the c2-
invariant is depicted in Figure 6. Going down the diagram reduces the number of
objects at a given loop order. Note that the existence of a c2-invariant for completed
graphs and the relation to the period are conjectural. The ancestors of all φ4 graphs
up to eleven loops are contained in the attached ﬁles.
5.5. c2-invariant −1. It is conjectured in [23] that primitive log-divergent φ4 graphs
have c2-invariant −1 if and only if their ancestor is the complete graph with ﬁve
vertices K5 (= P3 in [51]). Their periods are conjectured to be MZVs:
Conjecture 5.12. If G is a primitive log-divergent graph with c2-invariant −1,
then P(G) is an MZV of weight 2hG − 3.

Up to eight loops the periods of all graphs with c2-invariant −1 are known.
14This means P (anc(G)) ∈ ZN [ξN ] for some N, according to our Deﬁnition 5.9. However, a
weight ﬁltration exists on all Feynman periods [19], so Conjecture 5.11 could be formulated without
this restriction to such periods which evaluate to multiple polylogarithms.

Figure 7. The ladder L8 = P8,16 provides the weight 10 transcen-
dental Q10 in [51]. The ladder L10 = P10,425 conjecturally provides
the weight 12 transcendental Q12,5 (see Section 5.10).

5.6. c2-invariant 0. Graphs with c2-invariant 0 are weight drop graphs (by deﬁni-
tion). If a weight drop graph G has a period in ZN for some N then it is conjectured
that the weight of P(G) is ≤ 2hG − 4. More precisely, the results in φ4 theory are
consistent with the following conjecture:
Conjecture 5.13. Let G be a primitive log-divergent φ4 graph with c2-invariant 0.
If P(G) is mixed Tate, then either P(G) is of pure weight 2hG − 4 or P(G) mixes
(some) weights between hG + 2 and 2hG − 5.

The majority of graphs with known period have c2-invariants 0 or −1. The ﬁrst
graphs with double weight drop are triple products of the (completed) graph K5.
They have seven loops and period (6ζ(3))3. The ﬁrst non-product graph with double
weight drop is the eight loop graph L8 = P8,16 which mixes weights 10 and 11 (see
Figure 7). It provides the weight 10 MZV transcendental Q10 in [51]. Note that Q10
is absent at seven loops. Because Q10ζ(3) appears in several eight loop φ4 periods
the existence of P8,16 is vital for δ3 to close on φ4 periods (in Scenario 1). We see
this fact by the appearance of P8,16 in the right column of Table 4 at the end of
this article.
Note that by the above conjecture, φ4 periods in some ZN of weight ≤ 11 can
only appear in Pφ4,≤7 or in multiple weight drop graphs up to nine loops. Because
Pφ4,≤7 is known and, assuming Conjecture 5.11, all multiple weight drop φ4 periods
of at most nine loops are known, we conjecture that we know all mixed-Tate φ4
transcendentals up to weight 11 (see Table 1). Conjecturally, they are generated by
(products of) the Riemann zeta values ζ(3), ζ(5), ζ(7), ζ(9), ζ(11) and the MZVs

3 Im Z6
given in (1.16).
Assuming Scenarios 1 and 2 the alternating sums (Z2) of smallest weight have to
appear in weight drop graphs: Assume G is a primitive log-divergent φ4 graph of
maximum weight 2hG − 3 and P(G) is minimal in Z2 \ Z. Consider the f-alphabet
expression ψD2(G) for P(G). By Theorem 3.7 it must contain a word w with the
letter f 2
1 , we get a contradiction: P(G) would
have a non-MZV Galois conjugate δnP(G) ∈ Z2 \ Z (δnw contains the letter f 2
1 )
of lower weight. This contradicts the minimality of P(G), because δnP(G) ∈ Pφ4
by Scenario 1. Therefore n = 1 and δ1P(G) 6= 0. The weight of δ1P(G) is 2hG − 4,
but Scenario 2 implies δ1P(G) ∈ Plog,≤hG−1 which has maximum weight 2hG − 5.
This observation is consistent with the known data: The ﬁrst alternating sum is
Q12,4 (1.17) with weight 12 in the double weight drop nine loop period P9,36 = P9,75.
The single weight drop period P9,108 = P9,111 is an alternating sum of weight 14.
Assuming Scenario 1 the alternating sum Q12,5 (1.18) is expected in the triple weight

non-φ4 weight drop graphs with eight loops (e.g. in P
Conjecture 5.13 is false for non-φ4 graphs. There exist primitive log-divergent
non-φ4 graphs G which mix all weights from 6 to 2hG − 4 (e.g. the seven loop
graph P
). In general, compared to non-φ4 periods, φ4 periods very rarely mix
weights.
5.7. c2-invariant −z2. We were able to calculate ten φ4 periods of seven, eight,
and nine loops with c2-invariant −z2 (see e.g. [51] for P7,8 and [8, 9, 45] for P7,9).
Conjecture 5.14. If G is a primitive log-divergent graph with c2-invariant −z2,
then P(G) ∈ Z2 of weight 2hG − 3.

Rather frequently, periods of such graphs are actually MZVs. These cases include
all graphs with known period and c2-invariant −z2 with ≤ 8 loops; in particular
P7,8 and P7,9. A possible explanation for this very late appearance of alternating
sums (compared to sixth roots of unity, which appear starting at 7 loops) follows
from Scenarios 1 and 2 as we discussed in the previous subsection.
Conjecture 5.15 (Assuming Scenario 2). Let N ∈ {2, 3, 4} and G be a primitive
log-divergent φ4 graph with period P(G) ∈ ZN[ξN] with maximum weight 2hG − 3.
Then δ1P(G) = 0, where δ1 is the derivation with respect to the weight one letter

N of Corollary 3.6.

Assuming Scenarios 1, 2 and full knowledge of the mixed-Tate φ4 transcendentals
of weight ≤ 11 (see Section 5.6), we expect the ﬁrst non-MZV alternating sum
among graphs with c2-invariant −z2 at nine loops, weight 15. Then, δ3 can give
a Q-linear combination of Q12,4, (1.17), Q12,5, (1.18), and the weight 12 MZVs in

3((Z3 \ Z6) ∩ iR).

In a certain sense it is a general property that Z3 conversions produce smaller
numbers than Z6 conversions. We do not think that it hints to a more fundamental
connection between Pφ4 and Z3. Even (much) smaller numerators and denominators
are found in a basis given in [10].
5.9. c2-invariant −z4. There exist one φ4 graph at eight loops (P8,40) and three φ4
graphs at ten loops with c2-invariant −z4 [23]. Analogously to the case of c2 = −z3
our method is expected to produce maximum weight periods in i(Z4 ∩ iR) which are
never in Z2. Therefore it is suﬃcient to test if a period is in principle accessible by
our method without performing the actual calculations to conjecture new elements
in Pφ4. However, our method fails for all four φ4 graphs with c2-invariant −z4 up
to loop order ten. Interestingly, it works (in principle) for some non-φ4 graphs of
nine loops with c2-invariant −z4. So we can only conjecture new elements in the
larger space Plog of all primitive log-divergent periods.
5.10. Scenario 1 and the ladder L10. By (5.5) Scenario 1 requires Q12,5 ∈ Pφ4.
Conjecture 5.13 restricts the set of possible periods to ten loops, Q12,5 ∈ Pφ4,≤10.
All φ4 weight drop periods are known up to eight loops. This rules out the possibility
that Q12,5 is in a single weight drop φ4 period at eight loops. Because the periods of
all weight drop φ4 ancestors are known up to nine loops we can use Conjecture 5.11
to identify the graphs with multiple weight drop. The periods of these graphs are
known up to nine loops. Hence, Q12,5 can only exist in a ten loop graph. The only
unknown ten loop weight drop ancestor is P10,1139. Because all known weight drop
ancestors only had single weight drop we conjecture that Q12,5 is not in P10,1139.
The multiple weight drop φ4 ten loop periods are known with the exception of
P10,47 and L10 = P10,425. From a partial calculation we have strong evidence that
P10,47 mixes weights 14 and 15. Conjecturally, the only possible source for Q12,5 is
therefore L10.

The graph L10 belongs to the family of ladder graphs L2n for n ≥ 3 (see Figure 7)
. For n ≥ 4 these are the unique smallest
which have ancestor anc(L2n) = K n−1
non-product graphs with this ancestor. The graph L8 = P8,16 mixes weights 10
and 11 and it is the only source of Q10 which is demanded, similarly to (5.5), by
Scenario 1. Extrapolating from the cases 2n = 6 (L6 = P6,3) and 2n = 8 we
conjecture that for n ≥ 3 the period L2n mixes weights 2n + 2 to 3n − 1.
Conjecture 5.18 (Assuming Scenario 1, Conjectures 5.11, 5.13). The period L10 =
P10,425 mixes weights 12 to 14. For the weight 12 part of L10 we have

W12L10 ∈ QQ12,4 + Q

×Q12,5 + W12Pφ4,≤8.

Unfortunately, none of our currently available tools allows us to calculate L10.
5.11. Beyond multiple polylogarithms. With our methods we can only compute
periods which can be expressed as linear combinations of multiple polylogarithms
with algebraic coeﬃcients and arguments. These are periods of mixed Tate motives
and enjoy extra structure as compared to periods in general [20], including:

• They have a well-deﬁned grading by integer weights in our MZV-inspired
• The coaction acts unipotently, saying that all Galois conjugates of such a

counting (which equal half the weights from Hodge theory).

period x, except for x itself, have lower weight than x.

For general periods, the weight is merely a ﬁltration and we should expect to see
half-integer weights. Furthermore, a period can have several Galois conjugates of
the same weight (from the action of the reductive part of the Galois group).

Not a single non-mixed Tate φ4 period has so far been computed, but they are
known to occur starting from 8 loops in graphs with modular c2-invariants [21, 22].
Concretely, there are four 8 loop φ4 periods with modular c2-invariants (P8,37, P8,38,
P8,39 and P8,41 [23]), and for P8,37 it is known that the framing given by the period
(1.3) is not of mixed Tate type [21].
Furthermore, the non-mixed Tate contribution of P8,37 has weight 12. In fact, a
non-mixed Tate contribution to a period P(G) necessarily has weight below 2hG − 3.
It is not excluded that the other 8-loop periods with modular c2-invariant contribute
non-mixed Tate periods to Pφ4 in even smaller weights. This is the reason why we
had to restrict our statements about W≤11Pφ4 in Section 5.6 and Table 1 to the
mixed-Tate subspace.
In view of the possibility to ﬁnd several weight 12 Galois conjugates of P8,37, it
is unclear if our Conjecture 1.3 can persist beyond the mixed Tate frontier, but we
have no means to probe this realm for the time being.

6. Data

Two text ﬁles are attached to this article: Periods and PeriodsNonPhi4. These
ﬁles contain Maple readable lists of φ4 periods up to eleven loops and non-φ4 periods
up to eight loops, respectively. The data-structure in Periods is:

Period(cid:2)loop order, number(cid:3) :=(cid:2)list of graph edges, period in the f-alphabet,

period as multiple polylogarithms, numerical value to 100 digits,

c2-invariant, ancestor, size of the automorphism group(cid:3)

Note that we list completed graphs which we introduced in Deﬁnition 5.1.
In
particular, an ‘-loop primitive log-divergent φ4 graph G has a 4-regular completion

THE GALOIS COACTION ON φ4 PERIODS

25

G with ‘ + 3 loops. For example, the entry Period[3, 1] for the only 3-loop period
P3, known as the wheel with 3 spokes, starts with the edge-list

[{1, 2},{1, 3},{1, 4},{1, 5},{2, 3},{2, 4},{2, 5},{3, 4},{3, 5},{4, 5}]

of the complete graph K5. The only non-MZVs among our results are polylogarithms
at 2nd and 6th roots of unity. The corresponding f-alphabet expressions refer to
Deligne’s basis (N = 2) and the parity basis D0
6 of Corollary 3.6.15 In order to be
absolutely clear and avoid any confusion, we also express all known periods explicitly
in terms of multiple polylogarithms (2.2). For non-MZVs, these are represented as

where ξ ∈(cid:8)−1, e±iπ/3(cid:9) is a corresponding root of unity. If the period of some graph

zeta[[ξ, nr], nr−1, . . . , n2, n1] := Linr,...,n1(ξ)

is unknown, the corresponding three entries in the table are marked with FAIL.

In PeriodsNonPhi4 graphs which are not in φ4 are stored with the ﬁrst ﬁve

entries of the above list.

In the following table we demonstrate that the known φ4 periods up to 8 loops
obey the coaction conjecture. For this we express the inﬁnitesimal coaction in terms
of φ4 periods.
