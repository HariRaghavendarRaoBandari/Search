SEMICLASSICAL SOBOLEV CONSTANTS FOR THE

ELECTRO-MAGNETIC ROBIN LAPLACIAN

S. FOURNAIS, L. LE TREUST, N. RAYMOND, AND J. VAN SCHAFTINGEN

Abstract. This paper is devoted to the asymptotic analysis of the optimal Sobolev
constants in the semiclassical limit and in any dimension. We combine semiclassical
arguments and concentration-compactness estimates to tackle the case when an
electro-magnetic ﬁeld is added as well as a smooth boundary carrying a Robin
condition. As a byproduct of the semiclassical strategy, we also get exponentially
weighted localization estimates of the minimizers.

1. Introduction

1.1. Description of the problem. The aim of this work is to investigate optimal
Sobolev constants under an electro-magnetic ﬁeld and in a domain with a smooth
boundary. We want especially to investigate the behavior of these constants in the
semiclassical limit.
1.1.1. Geometric context. Before describing our main results, we describe the geo-
metric context of this paper.
For d ≥ 2, we consider an open, bounded and simply connected set Ω ⊂ Rd
with smooth boundary. We also introduce the smooth electro-magnetic potential
(V, A) ∈ C∞(Ω, R × Rd) and the variable Robin coeﬃcient γ ∈ C∞(∂Ω, R). We let
G = (Ω, Id, V, A, γ) where Id stands for the standard Euclidean metric.
Deﬁnition 1.1. For notational convenience, we will constantly consider quintuples
gathering the Robin electro-magnetic geometry G = (U, R, V, A, c) where

i. U is a smooth open set,
ii. R is a Riemannian metric on U,
iii. the electric potential V belongs to C∞(U , R),
iv. the magnetic vector potential A belongs to C∞(U , Rd),
v. the Robin coeﬃcient c belongs to C∞(∂U, R).
If Φ : U0 → U is a local chart near the boundary, then we introduce the pull-back
geometry

Φ∗G = (U0, (dΦ)TR(dΦ), V ◦ Φ, (dΦ)T ◦ A ◦ Φ, γ ◦ Φ) .

We recall that the “magnetic ﬁeld” is the 2-form deﬁned as the exterior derivative

B = dA = d

Aj dxj

 ,

 dX

j=1

2cX

b d

k=1

Tr+ B =

βk .

where A is identiﬁed with a 1-form thanks to the Euclidean duality. The 2-form B may
be identiﬁed with the skew-symmetric matrix, called “magnetic matrix”, (Bk‘)1≤k,‘≤d
where Bk‘ = ∂kA‘ − ∂‘Ak. It is well known that the non-zero eigenvalues of the matrix
B are in the form (±iβk)1≤k≤b d
2c, βk > 0 and that 0 is always an eigenvalue in odd
dimension. This allows to deﬁne

In particular, if Tr+ B = 0, then B = 0.
Deﬁnition 1.2. We will say that the geometry G is homogeneous when (V, B, c) is
constant and when U is the whole space or a half-space, equipped with the Euclidean
metric R = Id. We will also say that a geometry is Euclidean when R = Id. In this
case, we will also use the notation G = (Rd, Id, V, A, 0), where A is a linear potential
associated with B.

1.1.2. Minimization problem. We now introduce the minimization problem under
consideration in this paper.

QG,h(ψ) =

∂U

Here, dσ is the surface measure on the boundary ∂U.

1.1.3. Homogeneity. Let us heuristically explain where the diﬀerent powers of h come
from. Let us introduce the temporary semiclassical parameter . We consider the
initial quadratic form:
(1.3)

|(−ia∇ + bA)ψ|2 + cV |ψ|2 dx + d

γ|ψ|2 dσ(x) .

Z

Z

After a semiclassical local zoom, we would like to get an homogeneous quadratic
form. It is suﬃcient to derive these appropriate powers “locally”, that is in the case
of a homogeneous geometry (and Ω being replaced for instance by the half-space U):

(1.4)

|(−ia∇ + bA)ψ|2 + cV|ψ|2 dx + d

c|ψ|2 dσ(x) .

∂Ω

∂U

U

Let us determine the a, b, c, d that lead to non-trivial situations.

First, we may always reduce the investigation to a = 1 by multiplying the quadratic
form by an appropriate power of . Then, we would like that, up to a semiclassical
zoom, all the diﬀerent quantities play on the same scale (if not, this would mean
that an eﬀect could be neglected). Thus, we let x = ηy with η 6= 0 and consider
the rescaled quadratic form

|(−i1−η∇ + b+ηA)ψ|2 + cV|ψ|2 dy + d−η

c|ψ|2 dσ(y) .

In order to balance all the electro-magnetic eﬀects, we choose c = 2− 2η = 2b + 2η =
d − η. We get

b = c − 1 ,

d = 1 + c
2 ,

η = 1 − c
2 .

Note that η 6= 0 means that c 6= 2 and that c = 2 corresponds then to a homogeneous
problem (which is not semiclassical!).

Therefore, coming back to (1.3), this leads to

|(−i∇ + c−1A)ψ|2 + cV |ψ|2 dx + 1+ c

2

γ|ψ|2 dσ(x) .

Now, if c − 1 > 1, this quadratic form is locally a perturbation of the one of −2∆
(with Neumann condition) and thus the Robin-electro-magnetic geometry can be

forgotten. Thus, if we are interested in geometric eﬀects, we only have to consider
c < 2. In this case, we write

2−2c

and we can consider h = 2−c as new semiclassical parameter. We get the powers
appearing in (1.2).
1.1.4. Basic properties. We can already make some elementary observations that we
will constantly use.

We ﬁrst recall the diamagnetic inequality (see for example [27, Theorem 7.21], [13,

Theorem 2.1.1]):

∀ψ ∈ H1

A(U) ,

k∇|ψ|k2

L2(U) ≤ k(−i∇ + A)ψk2

L2(U) .

This inequality implies that |ψ| ∈ H1(U) and we get, thanks to the classical trace
theorem, that its trace is well-deﬁned as an element of H 1
2 (∂U); thus QG,h is well-
deﬁned on H1
A(U). Another important property of the magnetic Laplacian is the
gauge invariance (see for example [27, §7.21]):
(1.5)
∀ϕ ∈ C∞(U),
Gϕ = (U, R, V, A + ∇ϕ, c) .
Let us already notice that it is not clear whether the inﬁmum (1.1) actually exists
when U is unbounded. Nevertheless, if V and c are non-negative, its existence is
obvious. In any case, when this inﬁmum exists and is a minimum, the corresponding
minimizers satisfy, in the sense of distributions, the following nonlinear focusing
equation

QG,h(eiϕ/hψ) = QGϕ,h(ψ),

with

(1.6)
where we assumed that kψkLp(U) = 1 and where n is the inward unit normal to the
boundary. By multiplying ψ by an appropriate constant, we therefore have a solution
(for p > 2) of the following stationary Schrödinger nonlinear equation

2cψ, on ∂U ,

(−ih∇ + A)ψ · n = −ih

 (−ih∇ + A)2ψ + hVψ = λ(G, h, p)|ψ|p−2ψ ,
 (−ih∇ + A)2Ψ + hVΨ = |Ψ|p−2Ψ ,

(−ih∇ + A)Ψ · n = −ih

2cΨ, on ∂U .

As a byproduct of our investigation, we will get the existence of non-trivial solutions
of (1.7) (solitons) that are localized (in the semiclassical limit) near the minima
of a concentration function describing the local nonlinear electro-magnetic Robin
geometry.
1.1.5. Mathematical context and motivations. The aim of this paper is to estimate
the optimal Sobolev constant λ(G, h, p) under generic assumptions on the geometry.
In the linear case, i.e. when p = 2, this problem has now a long history, especially
in two and three dimensions in the case of Neumann boundary conditions and V = 0.
The investigation of the lowest eigenvalue of the semiclassical magnetic Laplacian
can be motivated by the theory of superconductivity and the study of the third
critical ﬁeld in the Ginzburg-Landau theory. The reader may consult the book
by Fournais and Helﬀer [13] or the one by Raymond [33] for an introduction to
these topics. In this linear and purely magnetic framework, it appears that the
microlocalization of the eigenfunctions is strongly related to the asymptotics of the

5

lowest eigenvalue. This fact was noticed, for instance, in the papers by Helﬀer and
Morame [18, 19] where numerous techniques have been developed to analyze the
magnetic Laplacian and its eigenfunctions. Even more recently in [16, 34, 17], in
cases without boundary, subtle localization properties of the magnetic eigenfunctions
have played a fundamental role in the semiclassical spectral theory (and we will
meet again this aspect in the nonlinear context). In cases with boundaries, the
Robin condition is physically motivated by inhomogeneous superconductors (see
for instance the linear and nonlinear contributions by Kachmar [21, 22, 23, 20]): in
this context, the Robin condition is sometimes called “de Gennes condition”. In the
linear framework many recent contributions have also been made to investigate the
semiclassical curvature eﬀects with Robin condition (see for instance [11, 31, 24] and
also [15] in the case with symmetries).

In the nonlinear case p > 2, the theory does not seem as developed as in the linear
case, especially when a magnetic ﬁeld and a boundary are added. In the seminal
paper [10] and in the concentration-compactness spirit, it is proved that λ(G, 1, p)
is attained when G = (Rd, Id, 0, A, 0), when B is constant and non-zero and when
p is subcritical. In [8], the authors have analyzed the semiclassical situation and
obtained, up to subsequence extraction of the semiclassical parameter, the one term
asymptotics of λ(G, h, p) with the geometry G = (Ω, Id, V, A, +∞), when Ω bounded
and Tr+ B + V does not vanish. The idea in [8] was to use a semiclassical blow up
argument near each point x ∈ Ω and compare with nonlinear models with constant
electro-magnetic ﬁeld (Vx, Bx). In particular the minimizers are essentially localized
near the minima of the concentration function Ω 3 x 7→ λ((Rd, Id, Vx, Ax, 0), 1, p),
where Ax is a linear potential associated with the constant ﬁeld Bx (see also [2] where
some properties of the concentration function are discussed). As we mentioned above,
the localization properties of the magnetic eigenfunctions are strongly connected to
the eigenvalue asymptotics and this phenomenon is expected to be even stronger in
the nonlinear framework.

The present paper aims at extending the theory developed in [14] (in two dimensions
without boundary) by investigating the eﬀect of a smooth boundary carrying a Robin
condition, in any dimension. For that purpose, we will decouple the semiclassical linear
methods (described in [13, Part I]) and the concentration-compactness arguments.
By doing so we will derive a quantitative remainder in the semiclassical asymptotics
of λ(G, h, p) as well as quantitative localization estimates of the minimizers.
1.2. Assumptions and main results. We can now state our main assumptions
and results. Let us ﬁrst explain in which framework our problem is well-posed.
Lemma 1.3. The quadratic form QG,h is bounded from below and deﬁnes a self-
adjoint operator LG,h with compact resolvent whose domain is
ψ ∈ H1(Ω) : ((−ih∇ + A)2 + hV )ψ ∈ L2(Ω)

Dom (LG,h) =n

2 γ(x)ψ(x), x ∈ ∂Ωo

and (−ih∇ + A)ψ · n(x) = −ih
In particular, λ(G, h, 2) coincides with its lowest eigenvalue.
Remark 1.4. We recall that Ω is bounded and that V and A are smooth on Ω.
Therefore, if ψ ∈ H1(Ω) and ((−ih∇ + A)2 + hV )ψ ∈ L2(Ω), then ψ ∈ H2(Ω) so that
the Robin boundary condition is well-deﬁned by a classical trace theorem.

We will provide a suﬃcient condition, for the geometry G, that ensures that the
L2 norm is controlled by QG,h in the semiclassical limit h → 0. This condition will
be related to models with homogeneous geometry. Let us recall that, for all x0 ∈ Ω,
the vector potential, deﬁned in a convex neighborhood of x0,

satisﬁes, in this neighborhood,

We will meet the following homogeneous Euclidean geometries:
i. if x0 ∈ Ω, we consider Gx0 = (x0 + Rd, Id, V (x0),AL
x0, 0),
ii. if x0 ∈ ∂Ω, we consider Gx0 = (x0 + Tx0(∂Ω) + R+n(x0), Id, V (x0),AL
where Tx0(∂Ω) is the linear tangent space of ∂Ω at x0.
Let us now state our main assumption which is of spectral nature: we assume that

x0(x0) = 0

x0, γ(x0)),

the 2-eigenvalue is not degenerate.
Assumption 1.5. We assume that
i. Ω 3 x 7→ λ(Gx, 1, 2) = Tr+ B(x) + V (x) does not vanish,
ii. ∂Ω 3 x 7→ λ(Gx, 1, 2) is bounded from below by a positive constant.
We will provide suﬃcient conditions under which Assumption 1.5 is satisﬁed in
Section 6.2. Before presenting our main result, let us state a proposition that ensures
that the inﬁmum (1.1) is actually well-deﬁned and a minimum.
Proposition 1.6. There exist h0, C > 0 such that, for all h ∈ (0, h0), we have

λ(G, h, 2) ≥ h inf
x∈Ω

λ(Gx, 1, 2) − Ch

and, under Assumption 1.5, the inﬁmum (1.1) for G = G is a minimum.

We can transform Assumption 1.5 (related to the positivity of the spectrum) into
a semi-continuity property of the p-eigenvalue which will play a crucial role in our
investigation. This semi-continuity will be derived from a concentration-compactness
analysis and used when estimating the Sobolev constants from above.
Proposition 1.7. Under Assumption 1.5, the function x 7→ λ(Gx, 1, p) is lower
semi-continuous on Ω for p ∈ (2, 2∗).

Our main theorem is the following accurate estimate of the optimal Sobolev
constant with electro-magnetic ﬁeld and Robin condition on the boundary, in the
semiclassical limit.
Theorem 1.8. Let p ∈ (2, 2∗). Under Assumption 1.5, there exist h0 > 0, C > 0
such that, for all h ∈ (0, h0),

By Proposition 1.7, we may consider the set M ⊂ Ω of the minimizers of the
concentration function x 7→ λ(Gx, 1, p). In relation with the estimate of Theorem 1.8,
we can deduce the following (exponential) decay estimate of the minimizers away
from M.
Theorem 1.9. Let p ∈ (2, 2∗). Under Assumption 1.5, for all ε > 0 we deﬁne

R ≥ 1, the dilated domain ΩR = R Ω. In this section, we consider V = 1, A = 0,

1.3.2. Shrinking waveguides. It turns out that the strategies and methods of this
paper can be applied to partially semiclassical situations. Such limits appear for
example in nanophysics when a strong anisotropic conﬁnement is imposed or in the
context of quantum waveguides with small cross section. The reader may consult
[12, 9, 6] in relation with the spectral analysis of waveguides (or [25] in presence of
magnetic ﬁelds). The partially semiclassical limits are also of crucial importance in
the spectral analysis of problems with magnetic ﬁelds (see [4] and the book [33]).
Nevertheless, we do not aim here at being the most general as possible on this topics
and we will focus on the elementary example of bidimensional tubes shrinking in
their normal direction. We can notice here that such a situation was also considered
by del Pino and Felmer to investigate the Sobolev constants (see [7]). The result
below may be considered as a more quantitative version (in two dimensions) of their
result.
Let us consider a smooth and simple curve Γ in R2 and a variable height a : R →
[a0, a1], with a0 > 0. We assume that a admits a maximum (not attained at inﬁnity)
and that a0 ∈ L∞(R). We let

∀(s, t) ∈ R × (−1, 1) = Σ,

Φh(s, t) = Γ(s) + hta(s)n(s) .

We deﬁne the tube Σh = Φh(Σ) and we assume that Σh does not overlap itself, i.e.
that Φh is injective. Assuming in addition that the curvature is bounded, Φh is a
smooth diﬀeomorphism as soon as h is small enough. For p ∈ [2, +∞), we introduce

λDir(Σh, p) = λ((Σh, Id, 0, 0, +∞), 1, p) = inf

where Mε denotes here a ε-neighborhood of the set of the maxima of a.
1.4. Organization of the paper. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
is devoted to the investigation of the Sobolev constants when the geometry is
homogeneous (see Theorem 2.1). Under the condition that the boundary Sobolev
constant is strictly less than the interior constant, we prove that the boundary
constant is attained. Note that, in Section 2.7, we investigate the special one-
dimensional case of the half-axis with Robin condition and that we derive a condition
for the existence of the minimizers. In Section 3, we prove the ﬁrst estimates towards
the upper bound of Theorem 1.8. In Section 4 we introduce sliding partitions of
the unity compatible with a quantum localization formula and establish the lower
bound of Theorem 1.8. In Section 5, by combining the results of Sections 3 and 4,
we derive accurate Lp-localization estimates of the minimizers (Proposition 5.1) and
convert it into the exponential estimate of Theorem 1.9. In Section 6, we prove

9

Proposition 1.7 (and, with Propositions 3.1 and 3.3, this ends the proof of the upper
bound of Theorem 1.8). In Section 6, we also provide suﬃcient conditions under which
Assumption 1.5 is satisﬁed. Finally, Section 7 is devoted to the waveguide framework
and we establish Proposition 1.11. To conclude, we provide some perspectives in
Section 8.

2. Boundary Sobolev constants with homogeneous geometry

2.1. A ﬁrst result. The main goal of this section is to prove the following theorem by
using a variant of the concentration-compactness method (see the classical references
[28, 29, 36, 38], or the notes by Lewin [26]).
Theorem 2.1. Let us consider p ∈ (2, 2∗). We have the following two existence
results.
i. If G is a homogeneous geometry with U = Rd and such that λ(G, 1, 2) is positive,

then the inﬁmum λ(G, 1, p) is attained.

ii. If G is a homogeneous geometry with U being an half-space and such that λ(G, 1, 2)

is positive and

(2.1)

λ(G, 1, p) < λ(G, 1, p) ,

then the inﬁmum λ(G, 1, p) is attained.

Moreover, the condition (2.1) is always satisﬁed (for a given electro-magnetic ﬁeld)
as soon as γ ∈ (−∞, c0) with c0 > 0 small enough.
Remark 2.2. We will only prove Theorem 2.1 (ii). The proof of point (i) in Theorem 2.1
(which is related to the case when Ω = Rd) is simpler and can be adapted from the
proofs in [10] (see also [8]). The proof of Theorem 2.1 (ii) will take up the following
subsections. The proof of the last statement of the Theorem is given in Subsection 2.6
below.
Remark 2.3. The main diﬃculty in the proof of these results comes from the lack of
compactness due to the action of the non-compact group of translations. Indeed, for
any ψ ∈ H1
A(U) and any x0 ∈ Rd if U = Rd or x0 ∈ Rd−1 × {0} if U = Rd+ we can
deﬁne the magnetic translation

τx0ψ(x) = e−iA(x0)·xψ(x − x0)

which satisﬁes

QG,1(ψ) = QG,1(τx0ψ)

and

kψkLp = kτx0ψkLp .

Since the minimization problem λ(G, h, p) is translation invariant, we always have:

λ(G, h, p) = inf

By Remark 2.3, (τxj ψj)j≥0 is also a minimizing sequence, (xj)j≥0 being any sequence

We overcome this diﬃculty thanks to the concentration-compactness principle.

Our proof is divided in three steps. We show that :

(1) (ψj)j≥0 is uniformly bounded in H1
(2) up to magnetic translation and up to extraction ψj * ψ 6= 0 weakly in
(3) ψj → ψ strongly in H1

Proposition 2.4. Under the assumptions of Theorem 2.1 (ii) there exists C > 0
such that for all ψ ∈ H1
L2(Rd+) + k∇|ψ|k2

L2(Rd+) ≤ kψk2

L2(Rd+) + k(−i∇ + A)ψk2

Therefore,

λ(G, 1, p) > 0

(cid:19)

A(Rd+)
and any minimizing sequence (ψj)j≥1 (normalized in Lp) is bounded in H1
whereas (|ψj|)j≥1 is bounded in H1(Rd+). Moreover, we can assume that for all j ≥ 1,
(2.3)

kψjk2

L2(Rd+) ≤ 2λ(G, 1, p)
λ(G, 1, 2) .

In order to estimate the boundary term, we will need the following two lemmas.
Lemma 2.5. There exists C > 0 such that, for all ε > 0 and ψ ∈ H1(Rd+), we have

L2(Rd+) + Cε−1kψk2
Proof. The proof is based on the elementary trace estimate:

L2(Rd−1×{0}) ≤ εk∇ψk2

kψk2

L2(Rd+) .

∃C > 0,

∀ψ ∈ H1(Rd

kψk2

L2(Rd×{0}) ≤ Ckψk2

that may be proved by density and partial integration. Then, for all ϕ ∈ H1(Rd−1

and ρ > 0, we let ψρ(x) = ϕ(ρx). This easily leads to

kϕk2

L2(Rd−1×{0}) ≤ C

L2(Rd+) + ρ−1kϕk2

L2(Rd+)

,

and we choose ρ = C−1ε.
Lemma 2.6. There exists C > 0 such that for all ε > 0 and all ψ ∈ H1(Rd+),
L2(Rd+) .

QG,1(ψ) ≥ (1 − Cε|γ|)k(−i∇ + A)ψjk2

L2(Rd+) + (V − C|γ|ε−1)kψk2

Proof. It is a consequence of the diamagnetic inequality:

∀ψ ∈ H1

A(Rd

k∇|ψ|k2

L2(Rd+) ≤ k(−i∇ + A)ψk2

L2(Rd+) ,

and of Lemma 2.5.

We can now deduce Proposition 2.4.

Proof. By point (i) of assumption 1.5, we have that λ(G, 1, 2) > 0 so that

L2(Rd+) ≤ kψk2

L2(Rd+) + k(−i∇ + A)ψk2

Finally, we deduce thanks to Sobolev’s injections that

λ(G, 1, p) > 0 for any p ∈ [2, 2∗]

(cid:3)
and the conclusion follows.
2.3. Excluding the boundary vanishing. We now focus on the following propo-
sition (see [29, Lemma I.1], [38, Lemma 1.21], [30, Lemma 2.3], [37]).
Proposition 2.7. Let us consider R > 0 and consider the paving near the boundary

Let us now come back to our minimization sequence (ψj)j≥1 (that satisﬁes (2.2),

Lq(ΣR) ≤ S2kψk2

by deﬁnition).
Proposition 2.8. We take q = p. There exists R > 0, a subsequence extraction and
mR > 0 such that

H1(ΣR)M q−2

R (ψ) .

∀j ≥ 1,

MR(ψj) ≥ mR > 0 .

Moreover, we get
(2.4)
If we let

∃(kj)j≥1 ∈ Zd−1 × {0},

∀j ≥ 1,

kψjkLp(Ωkj ,R) ≥ mR .

ϕj(x) := e−iA(Rkj)·xψj(x − Rkj) ,

then (ϕj)j≥1 is a minimizing sequence that, up to a subsequence extraction, weakly
converges to some ϕ 6= 0 in H1
A(Rd+) equipped either with the sesquilinear form BG,1
associated with QG,1 or the standard scalar product.

12

S. FOURNAIS, L. LE TREUST, N. RAYMOND, AND J. VAN SCHAFTINGEN

Proof. Let us analyze the ﬁrst part of the statement. Let us assume by contradiction
that, for all R,

By applying Proposition 2.7 to ψ = |ψj| and using Proposition 2.4, we infer that

j→+∞ MR(ψj) = 0.
lim

(2.5)

j→+∞kψjkLp(ΣR) = 0 .
lim

This means that we are in the “boundary vanishing” situation.
Let us now introduce a partition of unity to distinguish between a neighborhood
of the boundary and the interior. There exists C > 0 such that for all R ≥ 1 and
two smooth functions on R+ (depending only on the transversal variable xd), χ1,R,
χ2,R such that

1,R + χ2
χ2

2,R = 1 ,

1,R|2 + |χ0

1,R|2 ≤ CR−2 ,

and where χ1,R is a smooth and compactly supported function being 1 for |xd| ≤ R
2
and 0 for |xd| ≥ R. A well-known localization formula gives
k,Rψjk2

QG,1(χk,Rψj) − kχ0

It follows that, using (2.3),

QG,1(ψj) = X
QG,1(ψj) ≥ X

k=1,2

QG,1(χk,Rψj) − 2CR−2 λ(G, 1, p)

By a support consideration, we get

Lp(Rd+) ,
so that there exists C > 0 such that, for all j ≥ 1 and R ≥ 1,

QG,1(χ2,Rψj) ≥ λ(G, 1, p)kχ2,Rψjk2

QG,1(ψj) ≥ λ(G, 1, p)kχ2,Rψjk2

Lp(Rd+) − 2CR−2 λ(G, 1, p)
λ(G, 1, 2) .

Thanks to (2.5), we deduce that
j→+∞kχ1,Rψjk2
lim

Lp(Rd+) = 0 ,

so that, with the Lp-normalization of ψj,

λ(G, 1, p) ≥ λ(G, 1, p) − 2CR−2 λ(G, 1, p)
λ(G, 1, 2) .

Finally, we reach a contradiction to (2.1) by choosing R large enough. Therefore,
the ﬁrst part of the statement is now proved.

sequence comes from the gauge invariance presented in Remark 2.3.

Then, (2.4) follows by deﬁnition of MR. The fact that (ϕj)j≥1 is still a minimizing
By a simple translation, we have that, for all j ≥ 1,

kϕjkLp(Ω0,R) ≥ mR .

Since (ϕj)j≥0 may be assumed (by the Banach-Alaoglu Theorem) to converge weakly
(and pointwise) in H1

A(Rd+) to ϕ and by compact embedding:

kϕkLp(Ω0,R) ≥ mR > 0 .

(cid:3)

13

2.4. Excluding the dichotomy.
Proposition 2.9. The function ϕ of Proposition 2.8 satisﬁes kϕkLp(Rd+) = 1.
Proof. By the Fatou lemma, we have α := kϕkp

Lp(Rd+) ∈ (0, 1].

We introduce δj = ϕj − ϕ for j ≥ 1. The sequence (δj)j≥1 weakly converges to
A(Rd+) equipped with the sesquilinear form BG,1 associated with QG,1. Thus

0 in H1
BG,1(δj, ϕ) → 0. We have

QG,1(ϕj) = QG,1(δj) + QG,1(ϕ) + 2ReBG,1(δj, ϕ) .

In other words, we can write
(2.6)
with εj → 0.

(2.7)

kϕj − ϕkp

QG,1(ϕj) = QG,1(δj) + QG,1(ϕ) + εj ,

We must prove that the Lp norm also splits into two parts:

Lp(Rd+) + kϕkp
Lp(Rd+) − kϕjkp
(cid:18)

QG,1(ϕj) ≥ λ(G, 1, p)

Let us temporarily assume that (2.7) holds. Thanks to (2.6), and using (2.7),

Since (ϕj)j≥1 is a minimizing sequence, we get

But we have λ(G, 1, p) > 0 so that

(1 − α) 2

p + α

p ≤ 1 , with α ∈ (0, 1] .

Since p > 2 and by strict convexity, we must have α = 1. Therefore we conclude that
kϕkLp(Rd+) = 1. This ﬁnishes the proof of the proposition, modulo the proof of (2.7).
For that purpose we write

˜εj :=

|ϕj − ϕ|p − |ϕj|p + |ϕ|p dx .

Let us prove that the sequence (|ϕj − ϕ|p − |ϕj|p)j≥1 is equi-integrable on Rd+. There
exists C(p) > 0 such that,

For R > 0, by the Hölder inequality, we get

This proves the equi-integrability. Now the embedding H1(B(0, R)) ⊂ Lp(B(0, R))
is compact so that the sequence (ϕj)j≥1 strongly converges to ϕ in Lp(B(0, R)) and

thus, for j ≥ j(R, ε), (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Proof of Theorem 2.1 (ii). To ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 2.1 (ii), it remains to
notice that

λ(G, 1, p) = lim inf

j→+∞ QG,1(ϕj) ≥ QG,1(ϕ) ≥ λ(G, 1, p)kϕk2

Lp(Rd+) = λ(G, 1, p) ,

and thus ϕ is a minimizer.

(cid:3)

2.5. Exponential estimates. When the minimizers exist, they satisfy decay esti-
mates of Agmon type.
Proposition 2.10. If G is a homogeneous geometry with λ(G, 1, 2) > 0 and if the
inﬁmum (1.1) is attained, then, for all minimizer ψ, there exists α > 0 such that

eα|x|ψ ∈ L2(U) ,

QG,h(eα|x|ψ) < +∞ .

Proof. We only consider the case U = Rd+. Let us consider a minimizer ψ0 and
the nonlinear potential VNL = −λ(G, 1, p)|ψ0|p−2. We have VNL ∈ L p
p−2 (U). The
corresponding quadratic form is deﬁned on the space H1

This proves that QG,1,NL is bounded from below on H1
A(U) and thus deﬁnes a self-
adjoint operator LG,1,NL. The function ψ0 belongs to the domain of this operator and

15

satisﬁes LG,1,NLψ0 = 0. Now, the exponential decay will be established if we prove
that
(2.10) ∃C > 0 ,∀ε > 0 ,∃R > 0 ,∀ψ ∈ H1

A(U) ,

supp (ψ) ⊂ (cid:123)B(0, R) =⇒ QG,1,NL(ψ) ≥ (1 − Cε)QG,1(ψ) − Cεkψk2

L2(U) .

Indeed, this implies that, for all ψ ∈ H1

A(U) with supp (ψ) ⊂ (cid:123)B(0, R),

QG,1,NL(ψ) ≥ (1 − C0ε)λ(G, 1, 2)kψk2

L2(U) .

From this we can deduce, by using Persson’s theorem (see [32]), that we have
inf spess(LG,1,NL) ≥ λ(G, 1, 2) > 0 and the conclusion follows by using the Agmon-
Persson estimates (see [1] or for instance [33, Proof of Proposition 10.10]). From the
proof of these estimates, we may even ﬁnd an α > 0 common to all the minimizers ψ.
Therefore, let us explain where (2.10) comes from. For that purpose, we come
back to (5.3) with ε = 1 and we notice that, for all R ≥ 0 and ψ ∈ H1
A(U) such that
supp (ψ) ⊂ (cid:123)B(0, R),

Since VNL ∈ L p
goes to zero when R goes to inﬁnity. Then,
from (2.8) (and again Lemma 2.5 with the diamagnetic inequality to control the
(cid:3)
boundary term), we deduce (2.10).
2.6. A suﬃcient condition for boundary attraction. This section is devoted
to the proof of the last part of Theorem 2.1.
Proposition 2.11. If G is a homogeneous geometry with U being a half-space and
with ﬁxed (V, A), then there exists c0 > 0, such that for c ∈ (−∞, c0), we have

λ(G, 1, p) < λ(G, 1, p) .

Proof. Let us ﬁrst prove the inequality in the case G = (Rd+, Id, V, A, 0). Let u0 ∈
A(Rd) be a minimizer of λ(G, 1, p) given by point (i) Theorem 2.1 such that
H1
ku0kLp(Rd) = 1. Up to a translation in the ed = (0, . . . , 0, 1) direction and up to the
symmetry x 7→ −x, we can assume that

Thus, we are left with the case c 6= 0. Let us remark that

c 7→ λ(G, 1, p)

16

S. FOURNAIS, L. LE TREUST, N. RAYMOND, AND J. VAN SCHAFTINGEN

is a non-negative, concave and non-decreasing function of c since it is a inﬁmum of
non-negative, aﬃne and non-decreasing functions. Hence, we get the result provided
that λ(G, 1, p) ≤ λ(G, 1, p) for any c > 0. To do so, we build a sequence made of
magnetic translated of u0 in the ed direction that are multiplied by a cut-oﬀ function
so as to vanish on Rd−1 × {0}.
(cid:3)

2.7. Study of a one-dimensional model. In the last section, we have seen that
the existence of the minimizers in presence of a Robin boundary is ensured if the
Robin parameter is not too large. Actually, in dimension one (without electric or
magnetic ﬁeld), we can prove that, above a certain intensity, the minimizers do not
exist (as we will see in the following lines).
We are interested in the map c 7→ λ((R+, Id, 1, 0, c), 1, p). The goal is to get a good
understanding of the phenomena occurring, studying the simplest case when the
concentration-compactness principle is not needed. Indeed, we look for a real-valued
solution of the following ordinary diﬀerential equation problem:



−u00 + u = λ|u|p−2u

in R+,

u0(0) = cu(0),

kukLp(R+) = 1,

where λ = λ((R+, Id, 1, 0, c), 1, p), u ∈ H1(R+, R), p > 2 and c ∈ R. We get the
following result.
Proposition 2.12. The system (2.11) has a unique solution for c ∈ (−1, 1) and no
solution for |c| ≥ 1. Moreover, we have
(i) λ((R+, Id, 1, 0, c), 1, 2) > 0 if and only if c > −1,
(ii) λ((R+, Id, 1, 0, c), 1, p) < λ((R, Id, 1, 0, 0), 1, p) for all c ∈ (−1, 1),
(iii) λ((R+, Id, 1, 0, c), 1, p) = λ((R, Id, 1, 0, 0), 1, p) for all c ≥ 1.
We split our study into two steps:
i. Study of the Cauchy problem (2.11) with λ = 1 and c ∈ R ﬁxed but without the

ii. Study of the dependence of the solutions of (2.11) to describe the behavior of

restriction kukLp(R+) = 1.
the function c 7→ λ((R+, Id, 1, 0, c), 1, p).

2.7.1. First step. Let us remark that up to the change of unknown u (cid:32) uλ
system (2.11) without the constraint on the integral is equivalent to

1
p−2 , the

Obviously, we are only interested in nontrivial solutions of (2.12) so that without
loss of generality, we can assume that u(0) > 0. This is a Hamiltonian system

As a consequence, we immediately get that ∂rH(u(r), v(r)) = 0. Let us notice that
H is coercive:

limk(u,v)k→+∞ H(u, v) = +∞ ,

so that all solutions of (2.12) are global. Moreover, since we are looking for a solution

u ∈ H1(R+, R) i.e. such thatZ

(|u|2 + |v|2) dr < +∞ ,

R+

the initial condition has to satisfy H(u(0), v(0)) = 0. This follows from the continuity
of H since for any E 6= 0, there exists R > 0 such that
H−1({E}) ∩ B(0, R) = ∅

where B(0, R) is the open euclidian ball of radius R centered in (0, 0).

Thus, we obtain the following lemma.

Lemma 2.13. We have:
(i) for |c| ≥ 1, there is no nontrivial solution of (2.12),
(ii) for |c| < 1, there is a unique u0
c > 0 such that H(u0

c) = 0, the associated
solution (uc, vc) tends to (0, 0) at inﬁnity and satisﬁes uc(r) > 0 for all r ≥ 0.

Moreover, (0, 0) is the unique critical point of H−1({0}) and the conclusion follows
(cid:3)
from the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem.

Let us study now the decay at inﬁnity of uc and vc for |c| < 1.

Lemma 2.14. Let c ∈ (−1, 1). Then, (uc, vc) decays exponentially at inﬁnity and
uc belongs to H1(R+, R).

The quantity Tc,c0 > 0 is well-deﬁned from the proof of Lemma 2.14. By the
uniqueness of the solution in the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem, we get that

since H(uc, vc)(Tc,c0) = 0 and vc(Tc,c0) = c0uc(Tc,c0). This ensures that

(uc, vc)(· + Tc,c0) = (uc0, vc0)(·)

Lp(R+) ≥ λ((R+, Id, 1, 0, c), 1, p).

Lemma 2.15 ensures that c 7→ λc is strictly increasing. It remains to study the
limiting behavior of λc at ±1.
Lemma 2.16. We have

λc = λ((R, Id, 1, 0, 0), 1, p)

and

lim
c→1

so that, for all c ∈ (−1, 1),

lim
c→−1

λc = 0 ,

λc = λ((R+, Id, 1, 0, c), 1, p) .

19

Proof. Let us denote by

Tc := Tc,0 = inf{r > 0 : arctan(vc(r)/uc(r)) < 0} .

By the Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem, we get that

(uc, vc)(r + Tc) = (u, u0)(r) for all r ∈ [−Tc, +∞)

where (u, v) is the solution of

−u00 + u = |u|p−2u on R

such that u(0) = u0
Theorem 2.1 ensures that

0 and u0(0) = 0 with u0

0 given by Lemma 2.13. Let us remark that

since (0, 0) is an equilibrium of (2.12). The same ideas give that

lim

λc = 0 .

Finally, Theorem 2.1 and Lemma 2.15 allow us to conclude.
Let us end this section with the proof of Proposition 2.12.

(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 2.12. The ﬁrst point follows from a standard spectral analysis
(for negative c there exists only one eigenvalue below the essential spectrum that is
1 − c2). The second point follows from Lemmas 2.15 and 2.16. The third point is an
(cid:3)
immediate consequence of the ﬁrst point, Lemma 2.13 and Theorem 2.1.

3. Upper bounds of λ(G, h, p)

The upper bound in Theorem 1.8 will be proved by inserting appropriate test
functions in the Sobolev quotient: either functions localized inside the domain, or
functions localized near the boundary. Of course, the case related to the boundary is
slightly more delicate and involves a local straightening of the boundary. Anyway,
after an appropriate rescaling, we will locally see the appearence of the concentration
function x 7→ λ(Gx, 1, p). Thus, we will have to select a minimal point of this function.
The existence of such a point x0 ∈ Ω is ensured by Proposition 1.7 which we will
prove in Section 5.
Depending on whether x0 ∈ Ω or x0 ∈ ∂Ω, this section is divided into two parts

and devoted to the proof of Propositions 3.1 and 3.3.

3.1. Interior estimate. Here is the estimate related to the interior contribution.
Proposition 3.1. Let x0 ∈ Ω. There exists h0 > 0, C > 0 such that, for all
h ∈ (0, h0),

Proof. Let us consider a smooth cutoﬀ function 0 ≤ χ0 ≤ 1 being 1 in B(x0, ε0) and
being zero away from B (x0, 2ε0). It follows from (1.8), (1.9) and (1.10) that there

3.2. Boundary estimate.
3.2.1. The electro-magnetic Robin Laplacian near the boundary. Let us describe the
geometry near the boundary of Ω. Since ∂Ω is smooth, we may consider a covering
(B(X‘, r))1≤‘≤N of ∂Ω such that the following holds. For each ‘ ∈ {1,··· , N}, there
exists a smooth parametrization Φ‘ : U‘ × (0, t‘) → Ω ∩ B(X‘, r), where U‘ ⊂ Rd−1 is
an open set with 0 ∈ U‘ and Φ‘(0, 0) = X‘.
Tx0(∂Ω) = (dΦ‘)y0 (Rd−1 × {0}) ,

x0 = Φ‘(y0) , y0 = (s0, 0) .

For x0 ∈ ∂Ω, we have

(cid:3)

We also recall that the metric induced by Φ‘ is in the form

G‘ = (dΦ‘)T dΦ‘ ,

and we let

|G‘| = det G‘,

g‘(s) = G‘(s, 0) ,

|g‘| = det g‘ .

Then, we shall discuss the expression of our Laplacian in these coordinates. If ψ is
supported in Ω∩B(X‘, r), we may use the change of variables x = Φ‘(s, t) and we get

Proof. Let us recall that we always have

λ(Gx0, 1, p) ≤ λ(Gx0, 1, p).

Let us consider ﬁrst the case of the strict inequality as in Theorem 2.1. Using the

where ˜Ψ0 belongs to S(Rd−1 × R+) and χ0 is a smooth cutoﬀ function such that
0 ≤ χ0 ≤ 1, being 1 in B(y0, ε0) and being zero away from B (y0, 2ε0). The parameter
ε0 is such that supp ˜ψh ⊂ U‘ × (0, t‘) and ϕ0 satisﬁes (3.1). With the same kind of
computations as previously (see Proposition 3.1), we get

Then, it remains to use the change of variable of Lemma 3.2 and take

where Ψ0 is a minimizer associated with λ(Gx0, 1, p).
λ(Gx0, 1, p) = λ(Gx0, 1, p)

a smooth cutoﬀ function such that 0 ≤ χ0 ≤ 1, being 1 in B(0, ε0) and being zero

5.2. Application to the exponential estimates. Now, Proposition 5.1 gives an
a priori control of the nonlinear potential −λ(G, h, p)|ψh|p−2 away from the minimal
set M. Therefore, in this region, we are essentially reduced to a perturbation of a
linear equation and we may establish decay estimates à la Agmon.

Proposition 5.2. For all ε > 0, ρ ∈(cid:16)0, 1

In other words, the nonlinear potential is a perturbation of the linear part in the

Let us now introduce our exponential weight. We consider a smooth cutoﬀ function

QNLG,h(eχh−ρdist(x,M)ψh) − Ch2−2ρkeχh−ρdist(x,M)ψhk2

L2(Ω) ≤ 0 ;

all the norms are ﬁnite in view of the boundedness of the domain Ω. Now we want
to distinguish between the region close to M and far from M. Thus we introduce
2 = 1 such that supp (χ2) ⊂ (cid:123)Mε.

Using again the localization formula, we deduce that

Thus we have

Now, we come back with this information to (5.4) to deduce that

QNLG,h(χ2eχh−ρdist(x,M)ψh) ≤ Ckψhk2

L2(Ω) ,

and then, from (5.3), we get

QG,h(χ2eχh−ρdist(x,M)ψh) ≤ Ch2−2ρkψhk2

L2(Ω) ≤ ˜Ch2−2ρkψhk2

Lp(Ω) , .

From the rough estimate QG,h(ψh) = λ(G, h, p) ≤ C and the localization formula, we
get

QG,h(χ1eχh−ρdist(x,M)ψh) = QG,h(χ1ψh) ≤ Ckψhk2

Lp(Ω) .

By using again the localization formula, we have

QG,h(eχh−ρdist(x,M)ψh) ≤ Ckψhk2

and thus

keχh−ρdist(x,M)ψhkLp(Ω) ≤ Ch−γkψkLp(Ω) ,

for some γ > 0. The conclusion easily follows.

6. Continuity estimates

In this section, we discuss diﬀerent kinds of continuity results.

6.1. Continuity. The following proposition (jointly with Propositions 3.1 and 3.3)
implies the upper bound announced in Theorem 1.8.
Proposition 6.1. Here we consider a constant geometry Gx with x ∈ Ω and let
p ∈ (2, 2∗). We have the following continuity properties.
(i) The function x 7→ λ(Gx, 1, p) is continuous on Ω.
(ii) The function x 7→ λ(Gx, 1, p) is continuous on ∂Ω.
(iii) The function x 7→ λ(Gx, 1, p) is lower semi-continuous on Ω.
Proof. Let us consider (i). This is a consequence of the results in [2, 8]. Actually the
reader may also adapt the forthcoming proof of (ii) to get the continuity.
Let us now prove (ii). Without loss of generality, we may assume that Ω = Rd+.
Indeed we can simply use a rotation (smooth with respect to x) and a change of
gauge to rotate the problem from the aﬃne tangent space to the tangent vector
space.
Let us consider a point x∗ ∈ ∂Ω and a sequence (xn)n∈N ⊂ ∂Ω such that xn → x∗
when n goes to inﬁnity. The proof is divided into two steps. First, it is rather easy
to get

λ(Gxn, 1, p) ≤ λ(Gx∗, 1, p) ,

for xn → x∗ ∈ ∂Ω ,

by using a minimizer associated with λ(Gx∗, 1, p) as test function. Then, we shall
establish

lim sup
n→+∞

n→+∞ λ(Gxn, 1, p) ≥ λ(Gx∗, 1, p) ,
lim inf

for xn → x∗ ∈ ∂Ω .

This last inequality is slightly more subtle and uses the concentration-compactness
strategy.

32

S. FOURNAIS, L. LE TREUST, N. RAYMOND, AND J. VAN SCHAFTINGEN

To simplify the notation, we denote QGxn ,1 = Qn and

λ(Gxn, 1, p) =: λ+
n ,
λ(Gxn, 1, p) =: λn ,

n→+∞ λ+

n→+∞ λn =: λ∗ .

Let ψn be an Lp-normalized function such that.

Qn(ψn) = εn + λ+

n

with limn→+∞ εn = 0. We notice that by the positivity property (ii) in Assumption 1.5,
(ψn) is bounded in L2(Rd+) and H1
loc(Rd+). By diamagnetism and Sobolev embedding,
we infer that (|ψn|) is also bounded in H1(Rd+). We are left with concentration-
compactness type arguments.
(a) Let us deal with the boundary vanishing.

Assume ﬁrst that for all R > 0
lim
n→+∞ MR(ψn) = 0.
By Proposition 2.7, we have that for all R > 0
n→+∞kψnkLp(ΣR) = 0

Let us consider a quadratic partition of the unity

χ2
R,1 + χ2

R,2 = 1 ,

with supp χR,1 supported in a neighborhood of the boundary of size R and such
that

k∇χR,1kL∞ ≤ C
R

.

For n ≥ 1, we have, by the usual localization formula (and the fact that (ψn) is
bounded in L2),

Qn(ψn) ≥ Qn(˜χR,1ψn) + Qn(˜χR,2ψn) − C

R2 ≥ Qn(˜χR,2ψn) − C
R2 .

Therefore, it follows that

Lp(Rd) − C
We take the limit n → +∞ and then R → +∞,

n ≥ λnkχR,2ψnk2

n ≥ lim
This is the result that we want to prove.

n→+∞ λ+

n→+∞ λn = λ∗ ≥ λ+∗ .

(b) Let us now exclude the dichotomy. We consider the case when there exists R0 > 0
such that MR0(ψn) does not go to 0. Up to extraction and magnetic translations
parallel to ∂Rd+, we may assume that (ψn)n≥1 weakly converges in H1
loc(Rd+) and
in Lq(Rd+) to some ψ∗ 6= 0 for all q ∈ [2, 2∗].
Assume by contradiction that α := kψ∗kp
Lp(Rd+) < 1. Let us again consider a

quadratic partition of the unity
˜χ2
R,1 + ˜χ2

R,2 = 1 ,

with supp ˜χR,1 ⊂ D(0, R) such that k∇χR,1kL∞ ≤ C
as previously, we have,

In particular, we get

(c) Finally we consider the pre-compact case. We obtain then that (ψn) converges

strongly to ψ∗ in Lp(Rd+). We also start with the localization formula

Qn(ψn) ≥ Qn(˜χR,1ψn) − C
R2 .

By the weak convergence in H1

6.2. Suﬃcient conditions. In this section, we discuss some suﬃcient conditions
which ensure that Assumption 1.5 can be satisﬁed. These conditions are based on
the following non-degeneracy result.
Proposition 6.2. The bottom of the spectrum λ(B) of the Neumann Laplacian with
constant magnetic ﬁeld on L2(Rd+) satisﬁes

and Bk is a vector belonging to Rd−1 and B⊥ is an skew-symmetric matrix of size
d − 1. The constant Θ0 ∈ (0, 1) (sometimes called de Gennes constant, see for
instance [13, Chapter 4]) is the bottom of the spectrum of the Neumann magnetic
Laplacian on R2

It is clear that we may ﬁnd a rotation that sends Bk onto kBkk2ed−1 and we may
assume that Bkd = 0 for 1 ≤ k ≤ d − 2. We notice that

Therefore, there is no more dependence on yd−1. We may notice that, by deﬁnition,

In the same way, dropping the term in Dyd and canceling the term ˜Bd d−1yd by a

6.3. The Dirichlet case. In this section we discuss the existence of the minimizers
when Ω = Rd+, V = 0, B is uniform, non-zero and when the boundary carries the
Dirichlet condition.
Proposition 6.4. Here d ≥ 3. Let us consider λ = λ((Rd+, Id, 0, A, +∞), p, 1) with
A ∈ L(Rd) such that dA is not zero. Then λ is not attained. Moreover, if we let
λ = λ((Rd, Id, 0, A, 0), p, 1), then λ = λ.
Proof. We recall that we always have λ ≤ λ.
Indeed λ is a minimum and any
it is suﬃcient to translate any
associated minimizer has an exponential decay:
minimizer to inﬁnity and use a cutoﬀ function.
We next claim that λ ≥ λ. Indeed, if ϕ is a test function for the problem in Rd+, we
extend ϕ by zero and denote by ϕ ∈ H1(Rd) its extension. We use ϕ as test function
for the quadratic form on Rd and get λ ≤ λ.
0(Ω) with kψkLp(Ω) = 1. Let
ψ ∈ H1(Rd) be the extension of ψ by 0. Therefore ψ is a minimizer associated with
λ and it vanishes on a non-empty open set. It also satisﬁes the elliptic equation (the
associated Euler-Lagrange equation):

Let us assume that λ is attained for a function ψ ∈ H1

7.2. Estimate of the normalized Sobolev quotient. We are now in position to
use the strategy developed in this paper on QΣ,a,h. Note here that we have a partially
semiclassical problem. First, we have to establish an upper bound for the Sobolev
quotient. For that purpose, we must freeze the height a to the maximal height amax,
attained at some point smax. We will need the following lemma.
Lemma 7.2. The Sobolev constant λDir(Σ, p) is attained. Any corresponding mini-
mizer has an exponential decay.
Proof. Once the Sobolev is attained, it is rather clear that the minimizers have an
exponential decay (see the proof of Proposition 2.10). The fact that the inﬁmum
is attained is a consequence of a concentration-compactness investigation along the
s-axis: we are in the compactness case modulo translations parallel to the s-axis. (cid:3)

8. Some perspectives

39

In this last section, we discuss some perspectives and open problems. There are
many possible directions to extend our investigation and we only select a few of them
in the next lines.

Firstly, it would be quite interesting to analyze the case of domains with cor-
ners. In the semiclassical regime, the strategy developed in [3] (for the case p = 2
and Neumann condition; see also [5] where the same strategy is used in the non-
magnetic Robin case) could likely apply to get semiclassical upper bounds (as in
Theorem 1.8). Nevertheless several modiﬁcations should be made (in particular
about the considerations involving a separation of variables or the Fourier transform).
The semi-continuity (see Proposition 1.7) in the Robin case and/or in dimension
higher than three does not seem to be obvious. For p = 2, it is only known for
the Neumann case with pure magnetic ﬁeld in two and three dimensions (see [3]).
For p > 2, one should perform a concentration-compactness investigation along the
singular chains. For the lower bound, the adaptations should be easier (with a change
of the localization scale near the conical singularities). Even in the case without
magnetic ﬁeld, it would be quite interesting to analyze the p-eigenvalue λ(G, 1, p)
when G = (U, Id, 1, 0, c) and where U is a dihedral. It seems that the question to
know if λ(G, 1, p) is attained is open (and the answer should strongly depend on c as
we guess from Proposition 2.12).

Secondly, the waveguide situation could be extended to general partially semi-
classical problems. For instance, one could ﬁrst consider a partially semiclassical
and pure electric interaction in Rd. Many inhomogeneous situations lead to this
kind of limit (especially in the case with magnetic ﬁeld as we see in [4]). In the
waveguides framework, the description of curvature eﬀects on the asymptotics of
p-eigenvalues seems to be an open area (for p = 2, it is known to play a role in the
lower order terms). In the case of waveguides of uniform width, we do not even know
if the energy of the nonlinear groundstate is strictly less than the nonlinear energy at
inﬁnity. These curvature eﬀects on the p-eigenvalues in magnetic/Robin situations
would be interesting as well, especially if we imagine that the non-linearity (p > 2)
ampliﬁes the localization properties of the linear groundstates.
