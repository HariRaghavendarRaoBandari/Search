Decompositions and bang-bang properties

Abstract

Two kinds of important optimal control problems for linear controlled systems
are minimal time control problems and minimal norm control problems. A minimal
time control problem is to ask for a control (which takes values in a control constraint
set in a control space) driving the corresponding solution of a controlled system from
an initial state y0 to a target set in the shortest time, while a minimal norm control
problem is to ask for a control which has the minimal norm among all controls
driving the corresponding solutions of a controlled system from an initial state y0 to
a target set at ﬁxed ending time T . In this paper, we focus on the case that target
sets are the origin of state spaces, control constraint sets are closed balls B(0, M )
in control spaces (centered at the origin and of radius M > 0) and controls are L∞
functions. The bang-bang property for a minimal time control problem means that
any minimal time control, as a function of time, point-wisely takes its value at the
boundary of B(0, M ), while the bang-bang property for a minimal norm control
problem means that each minimal norm control, as a function of time, point-wisely
takes the minimal norm.

This paper studies the bang-bang properties for the above-mentioned two kinds
of problems from a new perspective. The motivation of this study is as follows:
For a given controlled system, a minimal time control problem depends only on
(M, y0), while a minimal norm control problem depends only on (T, y0). When a
controlled system reads: y′(t) = Ay(t) + Bu(t), with (A, B) in Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0}),
an interesting phenomenon related to the bang-bang properties is as follows: The
product space consisting of all pairs (M, y0) can be divided into two disjoint parts so
that when (M, y0) is in one part, the corresponding minimal time control problem

has the bang-bang property; when (M, y0) is in another part, the corresponding
minimal time control problem has no any solution. The same can be said about
the product space consisting of all pairs (T, y0), as well as minimal norm control
problems. We call such decompositions as the BBP decompositions for minimal
time control problems and minimal norm control problems, respectively. Though
they can be easily derived from the Kalman controllability decomposition to the pair
of matrices (A, B), it seems for us that they are new. A natural question is how
to extend the above-mentioned BBP decompositions to the inﬁnitely dimensional
setting where state and control spaces are two real Hilbert spaces, A is a generator
of a C0-semigroup on the state space and B is a linear operator from the control
space to the state space.

The purpose of this paper is to build up the BBP decompositions in the in-
ﬁnitely dimensional setting. The main diﬃculty to get such extension is the lack
of the Kalman controllability decomposition in the inﬁnitely dimensional setting.
Our ﬁrst key to overcome this diﬃculty is to ﬁnd two properties held by any pair of
matrices (A, B) in Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0}) so that they have the following functional-
ities: First, with the aid of these properties, we can prove the BBP decompositions
in ﬁnitely dimensional setting, without using the Kalman controllability decompo-
sition; Second, these properties can be easily stated in the inﬁnitely dimensional
setting.

By assuming the above-mentioned two properties in the inﬁnitely dimensional
setting, we divide the product space of (T, y0) (or (M, y0)) into four disjoint parts,
with the aid of several functions and an aﬃliated minimal norm problem. For
minimal norm control problems, the ﬁrst part consists of those pairs (T, y0) so that
the corresponding minimal norm problems have no any solution. The second part
consists of those pairs (T, y0) so that the corresponding minimal norm problems hold
the bang-bang property and the null control is not their minimal norm control. The
third part consists of those pairs (T, y0) so that the corresponding minimal norm
problems hold the bang-bang property and the null control is their unique minimal
norm control. The last part is a curve segment γ1 in the product space of (T, y0).
For minimal time control problems, the ﬁrst part consists of those pairs (M, y0) so
that the corresponding minimal time control problems have no any solution. The
second part consists of those pairs (M, y0) so that the corresponding minimal time
control problems hold the bang-bang property. The third part consists of those pairs
(M, y0) so that the corresponding minimal time control problems have inﬁnitely
many diﬀerent minimal time controls and do not have the bang-bang property. The
last part is a curve segment γ2 in the product space of (M, y0). The aforementioned
two curve segments γ1 and γ2 are crucial parts for us in the following sense: First,
we are not sure if these curve segments are empty; Second, when (T, y0) ∈ γ1 (or
(M, y0) ∈ γ2), we know that the corresponding minimal norm (or minimal time)
control problem has a solution, but we are not sure if it has the bang-bang property.

Introduction

1.1 Motivation

Two kinds of important optimal control problems for linear controlled systems are minimal
time control problems and minimal norm control problems. A minimal time control
problem is to ask for a control (taking values from a control constraint set which is, in
general, a closed and bounded subset in a control space) which drives the corresponding
solution of a controlled system from an initial state to a target set in the shortest time,
while a minimal norm control problem is to ask for a control which has the minimal norm
among all controls that drive the corresponding solutions of a controlled systems from an
initial state to a target set at ﬁxed ending time. Several important issues on minimal time
(or minimal norm) control problems are as follows: The Pontryagin maximum principle
of minimal time (or minimal norm) controls (see, for instance, [8, 19, 22, 24, 46]); The
existence of minimal time ( or minimal norm) controls (see, for instance, [3, 23, 34]);
Their connections with controllabilities (see, for instance [4, 13, 30]); Numerical analyses
on minimal time (or minimal norm) controls (see, for instance, [12, 14, 27, 37, 45]); And
the bang-bang property of minimal time (or minimal norm) controls (see, for instance,
[6, 18, 19, 22, 25, 26, 28, 31, 33, 36, 40, 42, 43, 44, 47, 49]).

In this paper, we concern the bang-bang properties for these two kinds of problems in
the case that both state and control spaces are real Hilbert spaces, controlled systems are
linear and time-invariant, target sets are the origin of state spaces, control constraint sets
are closed balls in control spaces (centered at the origin) and controls are L∞ functions.
The bang-bang property for a minimal time control problem means that any minimal
time control, as a function of time, point-wisely takes its value at the boundary of the
control constraint set, while the bang-bang property for a minimal norm control problem
means that each minimal norm control, as a function of time, point-wisely takes the
minimal norm. The signiﬁcance of the bang-bang property for minimal time control
problems can be explained from the following aspects: (i) Mathematically, the bang-bang
property means that each minimizer of a functional (from [0, ∞) to a bounded and closed
subset in a Hilbert space) point-wisely takes value on the boundary of this subset. (ii)
From application point of view, the bang-bang property means that each minimal time
control takes the most advantage of possible control actions. For instance, controls always

4

have bounds which are designed by peoples. The bigger bounds are designed, the more
costs peoples pay.
If the bang-bang property holds for a minimal time problem, then
the designed bound for controls will not be wasted at almost each time. (iii) The bang-
bang property is powerful in the studies of minimal time control problems. For instance,
in many cases, the uniqueness of minimal time controls follows from this property; in
some cases, this property can help people to do more dedicate numerical analyses on
minimal time controls (see, for instance, [14, 37]). We can also explain the signiﬁcance
of the bang-bang property for minimal norm control problems from both mathematical
and application points of view.
In most literatures on the bang-bang property for the
minimal time (or minimal norm) control problems, peoples mainly concern about: (i) For
a given problem, whether the bang-bang property holds; (ii) Applications of the bang-
bang property (see, for instance, [6, 18, 19, 22, 25, 26, 28, 31, 33, 36, 40, 42, 43, 44, 47, 49]
and the references therein).

In this paper, we study the bang-bang properties of the minimal time control problems
and the minimal norm control problems from a diﬀerent perspective. The motivation of
this study is as follows: Two typical minimal time and minimal norm control problems
in the ﬁnitely dimensional setting are as follows: Let Rn and Rm (with n, m ≥ 1) be the
state space and the control space. Let (A, B) be a pair of matrices in Rn×n ×(Rn×m \{0}).
Given M > 0 and y0 ∈ Rn \ {0}, consider the minimal time control problem:

(T P)M,y0

T (M, y0) , {ˆt > 0 : ∃ u ∈ UM s.t. y(ˆt; y0, u) = 0},

(1.1)

where

UM , {u : R+ , [0, ∞) → Rm measurable : kukL∞(R+;Rm) ≤ M},

(1.2)

and y(·; y0, u) is the solution to the equation:

y′(t) = Ay(t) + Bu(t), t > 0; y(0) = y0.

(1.3)

Given y0 ∈ Rn \ {0} and T ∈ (0, ∞), consider the minimal norm control problem:

(N P)T,y0

N (T, y0) , inf{kvkL∞(0,T ;Rm)

: ˆy(T ; y0, v) = 0},

(1.4)

where v ∈ L∞(0, T ; Rm) and ˆy(·; y0, v) is the solution to the equation:

y′(t) = Ay(t) + Bv(t), 0 < t ≤ T ; y(0) = y0.

(1.5)

In the problem (T P)M,y0, T (M, y0) is called the minimal time; ˆu ∈ UM is called an
admissible control if y(ˆt; y0, ˆu) = 0 for some ˆt ∈ (0, ∞); u∗ ∈ UM is called a minimal
time control if y(T (M, y0); y0, u∗) = 0 and u∗ = 0 over (0, T (M, y0)). We say that the

5

problem (T P)M,y0 has the bang-bang property if any minimal time control u∗ veriﬁes

that ku∗(t)kRm = M for a.e. t ∈(cid:0)0, T (M, y0)(cid:1). When (T P)M,y0 has no any admissible

control, we agree that it does not hold the bang-bang property and T (M, y0) = ∞. In the
problem (N P)T,y0, N (T, y0) is called the minimal norm; ˆv ∈ L∞(0, T ; Rm) is called an
admissible control if ˆy(T ; y0, ˆv) = 0; v∗ ∈ L∞(0, T ; Rm) is called a minimal norm control
if kv∗kL∞(0,T ;Rm) = N (T, y0) and ˆy(T ; y0, v∗) = 0. We say that the problem (N P)T,y0 has
the bang-bang property if any minimal norm control v∗ veriﬁes that kv∗(t)kRm = N (T, y0)
for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ). When (N P)T,y0 has no any admissible control, we agree that it does
not hold the bang-bang property and N (T, y0) = ∞.

When (A, B) is ﬁxed in Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0}), the problem (T P)M,y0 depends only on

the pair (M, y0) which belongs to the product space:

and the problem (N P)T,y0 depends only on the pair (T, y0) which belongs to the space:

X1 ,(cid:8)(M, y0) : 0 < M < ∞, y0 ∈ Rn \ {0}(cid:9);
X2 ,(cid:8)(T, y0) : 0 < T < ∞, y0 ∈ Rn \ {0}(cid:9).

(1.6)

(1.7)

By applying the Kalman controllability decomposition to the pair (A, B) (see, for instance,
Lemma 3.3.3 and Lemma 3.3.4 in [38]), we can easily divide the space X1 into two disjoint
parts so that when (M, y0) is in one part, the corresponding (T P)M,y0 has the bang-
bang property; when (M, y0) is in another part, the corresponding (T P)M,y0 has no any
admissible control (which implies that it does not hold the bang-bang property). The same
can be said about the space X2. We call such decompositions as the BBP decompositions
for (T P)M,y0 and (N P)T,y0, respectively. The exact BBP decompositions for the above
two problems are the following (P1) and (P2):

(P1)

• When (M, y0) ∈ Dbbp, (T P)M,y0 has the bang-bang property;
• When (M, y0) ∈ X1 \ Dbbp, (T P)M,y0 has no admissible control.

(1.8)

Here,

N (T, y0)(cid:9),

(1.9)

R , B + AB + · · · + AnB, with B , {Bx ∈ Rn : x ∈ Rm}.

(1.10)

(P2)

• When (T, y0) ∈ X2,1, (N P)T,y0 has the bang-bang property;
• When (T, y0) ∈ X2,2, (N P)T,y0 has no admissible control,

(1.11)

6

where X2,1 , (0, ∞) × (R \ {0}) and X2,2 , (0, ∞) × (Rn \ R). (Notice that both Dbbp
and R \ {0} are not empty. These are proved in Appendix A, see (8.14) and (8.1).)

The proofs of (P1) and (P2), via the Kalman controllability decomposition, are given
in Appendix A. Though the proofs are quite simple, such BBP decompositions seem to
be new. (At least we do not ﬁnd them in any published literature.) A natural question
is how to extend the above-mentioned BBP decompositions to the inﬁnitely dimensional
setting where state and control spaces are two real Hilbert spaces, A is a generator of a
C0-semigroup on the state space and B is a linear operator from the control space to the
state space. The purpose of this paper is to build up such BBP decompositions in the
inﬁnitely dimensional setting. The main diﬃculty to get such extension is the lack of the
Kalman controllability decomposition in the inﬁnitely dimensional setting.

Our ﬁrst key to overcome this diﬃculty is to ﬁnd two properties held by any pair of
matrices (A, B) in Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0}) so that they have the following functionalities: (i)
With the aid of these properties, we can get the decompositions (P1) and (P2), without
using the Kalman controllability decomposition; (ii) These properties can be easily stated
in the inﬁnitely dimensional setting. The ﬁrst one is a kind of unique continuation property
from measurable set for functions: B∗eA∗(T −·)z, with T > 0 and z ∈ Rn. This property
follows immediately from the analyticity of the function t → B∗
1(T −t), t ∈ R, in the
In our inﬁnitely dimensional setting, it is the assumption
ﬁnitely dimensional setting.
(H2) given in the next subsection. The second property is quite hidden: For all t and
T , with 0 < t < T < ∞, and u ∈ L2(0, T ; Rm), with supp u ⊂ (0, t), there is vu ∈
L∞(0, T ; Rm), with supp v ⊂ (t, T ), so that ˆy(T ; 0, u) = ˆy(T ; 0, vu), where ˆy(·; 0, u) and
ˆy(·; 0, vu) denote the solutions of (1.5) with the same initial datum 0 and controls u and vu,
respectively.
(Proposition 8.2 in Appendix B proves that each pair of matrices (A, B) in
Rn×n×(Rn×m\{0}) holds this property.) The assumption (H1) given in the next subsection
is exactly the same version of the second property in our ﬁnitely dimensional setting.
About (H1), two facts are given in order: First, for a pair (A, B) in the ﬁnitely dimensional
setting, it may happen that the above-mentioned second property holds but (A, B) is not
controllable. Second, even in the inﬁnitely dimensional setting, the null controllability of
(A, B) implies that the above-mentioned second property (see Proposition 6.5).

1.2 Problems and assumptions

Let us ﬁrst introduce the minimal time and the minimal norm control problems studied in
this paper. Let X be a real Hilbert space (which is our state space), with its inner product
h·, ·iX and its norm k · kX. Let A : D(A) ⊂ X → X be a state operator which generates
a C0-semigroup {S(t)}t∈R+ on X. Write U for another real Hilbert space (which is our
control space), with its inner product h·, ·iU and its norm k · kU . Let B ∈ L(U, X−1) be a
nontrivial control operator (i.e., B 6= 0), where X−1 , D(A∗)′ is the dual of D(A∗) with

7

respect to the pivot space X. Throughout this paper, we assume that B is an admissible
control operator for {S(t)}t∈R+ (see Section 4.2 in [39]), i.e., for each ˆt ∈ (0, ∞), there is
a positive constant C1(ˆt), depending on ˆt, so that

(cid:13)(cid:13)Z ˆt

0

S−1(ˆt − τ )Bu(τ ) dτ(cid:13)(cid:13)X ≤ C1(ˆt)kukL2(0,ˆt;U ) for all u ∈ L2

loc(R+; U),

(1.12)

where {S−1(t)}t∈R+ denotes the extension of {S(t)}t∈R+ on X−1. In the ﬁnitely dimen-
sional setting where X = Rn, U = Rm, A ∈ Rn×n and B ∈ Rn×m \ {0}, (1.12) holds
automatically.

Two controlled equations studied in this paper are as follows:

y′(t) = Ay(t) + Bu(t), t > 0; y(0) = y0;

y′(t) = Ay(t) + Bv(t), 0 < t ≤ T ; y(0) = y0.

(1.13)

(1.14)

Here, y0 ∈ X, T > 0, controls u and v are taken from L∞(R+; U) and L∞(0, T ; U),
respectively. For each T > 0, y0 ∈ X and v ∈ L2(0, T ; U), a solution of the equation
(1.14) is deﬁned to be a function ˆy(·; y0, v) ∈ C([0, T ]; X) satisfying that when z ∈ D(A∗),

hˆy(t; y0, v), ziX − hy0, S∗(t)ziX =Z t

0

hv(s), B∗S∗(t − s)ziU ds, ∀ t ∈ [0, T ].

(1.15)

One can easily see from Lemma 2.2 that the deﬁnition of ˆy(·; y0, v) is the same as the
deﬁnition of a solution to (1.14) in [5, Deﬁnition 2.36]. Thus, it follows from [5, Theorem
2.37] and Lemma 2.2 that the equation (1.14) is well-posed. For each y0 ∈ X and u ∈
L∞(R+; U), a solution of the equation (1.13) is deﬁned to be a function y(·; y0, u) ∈
C(R+; X) so that for each T > 0, y(·; y0, u)|[0,T ] (the restriction of y(·; y0, u) over [0, T ])
is the solution to (1.14) with v = u|(0,T ]. Consequently, the system (1.13) is well-posed.
Besides, by Proposition 2.1, one can check the following two facts: First, for each y0 ∈ X
and u ∈ L∞(R+; U), the solution y(·; y0, u) to the system (1.13) satisﬁes that

y(t; y0, u) = S(t)y0 +Z t

0

S−1(t − τ )Bu(τ ) dτ, 0 ≤ t < ∞.

(1.16)

Second, if for some y0 ∈ X and u ∈ L∞(R+; U), a function y(·) ∈ C(R+; X) equals to the
right hand side of (1.16) point-wisely, then y(·) = y(·; y0, u) over R+.

For each pair (M, y0) ∈ (0, ∞) × (X \ {0}), we deﬁne a minimal time control problem:

(T P )M,y0

T (M, y0) , inf(cid:8)ˆt ∈ (0, ∞) : ∃ u ∈ U M s.t. y(ˆt; y0, u) = 0(cid:9),

8

(1.17)

where

(NP )T,y0

U M ,(cid:8)u : R+ → U strongly measurable : ku(t)kU ≤ M a.e. t ∈ R+(cid:9).

In the problem (T P )M,y0, the minimal time, an admissible control and a minimal time
control can be deﬁned in the same manners as in (T P)M,y0 (see (1.1)). We say that the
problem (T P )M,y0 has the bang-bang property if any minimal time control u∗ veriﬁes that

we agree that it does not hold the bang-bang property and T (M, y0) = ∞.

For each pair (T, y0) ∈ (0, ∞) × X \ {0}, we deﬁne a minimal norm control problem:

ku∗(t)kU = M for a.e. t ∈(cid:0)0, T (M, y0)(cid:1). When (T P )M,y0 has no any admissible control,
: v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) s.t. ˆy(T ; y0, v) = 0(cid:9).(1.18)

N(T, y0) , inf(cid:8)kvkL∞(0,T ;U )

In the problem (NP )T,y0, the minimal norm, an admissible control and a minimal norm
control can be deﬁned in the same ways as in (N P)T,y0 (see (1.4)). We say that the
problem (NP )T,y0 has the bang-bang property if any minimal norm control v∗ veriﬁes
that kv∗(t)kU = N(T, y0) for a.e.
t ∈ (0, T ). When (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible
control, we agree that it does not hold the bang-bang property and N(T, y0) = ∞.

We say that (A, B) has the L∞-null controllability if for any T > 0 and y0 ∈ X, there
is v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) so that ˆy(T ; y0, v) = 0. We say that the semigroup {S(t)}t∈R+ has
the backward uniqueness property if S(T )y0 = 0 ⇒ y0 = 0.
In our inﬁnitely setting,
we assume neither the L∞-null controllability nor the backward uniqueness property. To
make up the lack of these properties, we deﬁne the following two functions T 0(·) and T 1(·)
(which play important roles in our study):

T 0(y0) , inf(cid:8)ˆt ∈ R+ : ∃ u ∈ L∞(R+; U) s.t. y(ˆt; y0, u) = 0(cid:9) , y0 ∈ X;

T 1(y0) , inf(cid:8)ˆt ∈ R+ : S(ˆt)y0 = 0(cid:9) , y0 ∈ X.

(1.19)

(1.20)

When the set on the right hand side of (1.19) is empty for some y0, we let T 0(y0) , ∞.
The same can be said about T 1(y0).

Remark 1.1. (i) The pair (A, B) has the L∞-null controllability if and only if for each
y0 ∈ X, T 0(y0) = 0.
(ii) Though many controlled systems, such as internally or boundary controlled heat equa-
tions, hold the L∞-null controllability, there are some controlled systems having no the
L∞-null controllability. Among them, it may happen that T 0(y0) ∈ (0, ∞) for some y0 ∈ X
(see Remark 7.12).
(iii) The semigroup {S(t)}t∈R+ has the backward uniqueness property if and only if for
each y0 ∈ X \ {0}, T 1(y0) = ∞.

9

(iv) Though many semigroups governed by PDEs, such as heat equations and wave equa-
tions, hold the backward uniqueness property, there are some semigroups governed by
PDEs having no this property. Among them, it may happen that T 1(y0) < ∞ for all
y0 ∈ X. A transport equation over a ﬁnite interval is one of such examples.

From (1.18), we see that for each y0 ∈ X \ {0}, T → N(T, y0) deﬁnes a function
over (0, ∞). Since the quantities N(T 0(y0), y0) and N(T 1(y0), y0) will appear frequently,
T 0(·) may take values 0 and ∞, and T 1(·) may take value ∞, it is necessary for us to
give deﬁnitions for N(∞, y0) and N(0, y0). For this purpose, we notice that for each
y0 ∈ X\{0}, T → N(T, y0) is a decreasing function from (0, ∞) to [0, ∞]. (This can be
easily obtained from (1.18), see also (i) of Lemma 3.2 for the detailed proof.) Thus, we
can extend this function over [0, ∞] in the following manner:

N(∞, y0) , lim
t→∞

N(t, y0) and N(0, y0) , lim
t→0+

N(t, y0), y0 ∈ X \ {0}.

(1.21)

As mentioned in Subsection 1.1, we impose two assumptions on (A, B) as follows:

(H1) There is p0 ∈ [2, ∞) so that Ap0(T, ˆt) ⊂ A∞(T, ˆt) for all T , ˆt, with 0 < ˆt < T < ∞,
where

Ap0(T, ˆt) ,nˆy(T ; 0, u) : u ∈ Lp0(0, T ; U), with u|(ˆt,T ) = 0o;
A∞(T, ˆt) ,nˆy(T ; 0, v) : v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U), with v|(0,ˆt) = 0o.

(H2) If there is T ∈ (0, ∞), a subset E ⊂ (0, T ) of positive measure and a function f ∈ YT
so that f = 0 over E, then f ≡ 0 over (0, T ). Here,

YT , X

k·kL1(0,T ;U )
T

, with the L1(0, T ; U)-norm,

(1.22)

where

XT , {B∗S∗(T − ·)z|(0,T )

: z ∈ D(A∗)}, with the L1(0, T ; U)-norm.

(1.23)

Remark 1.2. (i) The assumption (H1) says roughly that the functionality of a control
supported on (0, ˆt) can be replaced by that of a control supported on (ˆt, T ). The assump-
tion (H2) says, in plain language, that any function in YT has some unique continuation
property from measurable sets.
(ii) We do not know if every function in YT can be expressed as B∗ϕ with ϕ a solution of
the adjoint equation over (0, T ), even in the case that B ∈ L(U, X). However, if (A, B) has
the L∞-null controllability, then the above-mentioned expression holds (see Remark 6.7).
(iii) Each pair (A, B) in Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0}) (with n, m ≥ 1) satisﬁes both (H1) and
(H2) (see Proposition 8.2 in Appendix B).

10

Our studies on the BBP decompositions are based on the assumptions (H1) and (H2).
However, our main results can be improved, if instead of (H1) and (H2), we impose the
following stronger assumptions (H3) and (H4):
(H3) The pair (A∗, B∗) is L1-observable over each interval (or simply L1-observable), i.e.,
for each T ∈ (0, ∞), there exists a positive constant C1(T ) so that

kS∗(T )zkX ≤ C1(T )Z T

0

kB∗S∗(T − t)zkU dt for all z ∈ D(A∗).

(1.24)

(H4) If z ∈ X satisﬁes that ]B∗S∗(T −·)z = 0 over E for some T ∈ (0, ∞) and some subset
E ⊂ (0, T ) of positive measure, then ]B∗S∗(T − ·)z ≡ 0 over (0, T ). Here, ]B∗S∗(T − ·) is
the natural extension of B∗S∗(T − ·) over X. (It will be explained in the next remark.)

Remark 1.3. (i) The function ]B∗S∗(T − ·) in (H4) is deﬁned in the following manner:
Since B ∈ L(U, X−1) is an admissible control operator for {S(t)}t∈R+, it follows from
Lemma 2.2 that B∗ is an admissible observation operator for {S∗(t)}t∈R+, i.e., for each
T ∈ (0, ∞), there exists a C(T ) > 0 so that

Z T

0

kB∗S∗(T − τ )zk2

U dτ ≤ C(T )kzk2

X for all z ∈ D(A∗).

(Indeed, [39, Theorem 4.4.3] proves that B ∈ L(U, X−1) is an admissible control operator
for {S(t)}t∈R+ if and only if B∗ is an admissible observation operator for {S∗(t)}t∈R+ in
the case where X and U are complex Hilbert spaces.) Thus, for each T ∈ (0, ∞), the
operator B∗S∗(T − ·) : D(A∗) → L2(0, T ; U) can be uniquely extended to a linear bounded
operator ]B∗S∗(T − ·) from X to L2(0, T ; U). More precisely, for each z ∈ X,

]B∗S∗(T − ·)z , lim
n→∞

B∗S∗(T − ·)zn in L2(0, T ; U),

(1.25)

where {zn} ⊂ D(A∗), with limn→∞ zn = z in X.
(ii) The condition (H3) is an L1-observability estimate for the pair (A∗, B∗), which is
equivalent to the L∞-null controllability for the pair (A, B). (See Proposition 6.4.)
(iii) The condition (H4) is a kind of unique continuation property of the dual equation
over (0, T ) for each T ∈ (0, ∞).
(iv) The condition (H1) can be implied by (H3) (see Proposition 6.5). However, (H1)
may hold when (H3) does not stand. For instance, when X = Rn and U = Rm (with
n, m ∈ N+), any pair (A, B) ∈ Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0}) satisﬁes not only the condition
(H1) but also the condition (H2) (see Proposition 8.2 in Appendix B). On the other
hand, it is well known that (A, B) is L∞-null controllable if and only if it is controllable,
and the later holds if and only if (A, B) satisﬁes the Kalman rank condition. Thus any

11

(A, B) ∈ Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0}) that does not satisfy the Kalman rank condition has the
property (H1) but does not hold the property (H3).
(v) The condition (H2) can be derived from (H3) and (H4) (see Proposition 6.6).

1.3 Main results

The main results of this paper concern with the BBP decompositions for (T P )M,y0 and
(NP )T,y0. To state them, we notice that the domain W of the pairs (T, y0) for (NP )T,y0
and the domain V of the pairs (M, y0) for (T P )M,y0 are the following spaces:

and

W =(cid:8)(T, y0) : 0 < T < ∞, y0 ∈ X \ {0}(cid:9),
V =(cid:8)(M, y0) : 0 < M < ∞, y0 ∈ X \ {0}(cid:9).

The main results of this paper are presented in the following two theorems:

Theorem 1.4. Let W be given by (1.26). Let W1,j (j = 1, 2), W2,j (j = 1, 2, 3, 4), and
W3,j (j = 1, 2, 3, 4) be given by (1.28), (1.30) and (1.32), respectively. Then the following
conclusions are true:
(i) The set W is the disjoint union of the above mentioned subsets Wi,j.
(ii) For each (T, y0) ∈ W1,2 ∪ W2,4 ∪ W3,3, (NP )T,y0 has the bang-bang property and the
null control is its unique minimal norm control.
(iii) Suppose that (H1) and (H2) hold. Then for each (T, y0) ∈ W2,3 ∪ W3,2, (NP )T,y0 has
the bang-bang property and the null control is not a minimal norm control to this problem.
(iv) For each (T, y0) ∈ W1,1 ∪ W2,1 ∪ W3,1 ∪ W3,4, (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible control
and does not hold the bang-bang property.
(v) For each (T, y0) ∈ W2,2, (NP )T,y0 has at least one minimal norm control.

13

Theorem 1.5. Let V be given by (1.27). Let V1, V2,j (j = 1, 2, 3, 4) and V3,j (j = 1, 2, 3)
be given by (1.34), (1.35) and (1.37), respectively. Then the following conclusions are
true:
(i) The set V is the disjoint union of V1 and the above mentioned subsets Vi,j.
(ii) Suppose that (H1) and (H2) hold. Then for each (M, y0) ∈ V2,2 ∪ V3,2, (T P )M,y0 has
the bang-bang property.
(iii) Suppose that (H1) holds. Then for each (M, y0) ∈ V2,4, (T P )M,y0 has inﬁnitely many
diﬀerent minimal time controls (not including the null control), and does not hold the
bang-bang property.
(iv) Suppose that (H1) holds. Then for each (M, y0) ∈ V1, (T P )M,y0 has inﬁnitely many
diﬀerent minimal time controls (including the null control), and does not hold the bang-
bang property.
(v) For each (M, y0) ∈ V3,3, (T P )M,y0 has no any admissible control and does not hold
the bang-bang property. If assume that (H1) holds, then for each (M, y0) ∈ V2,1 ∪ V3,1,
(T P )M,y0 has no any admissible control and does not hold the bang-bang property.
(vi) For each (M, y0) ∈ V2,3, (T P )M,y0 has at least one minimal time control.

Figure 1: The BBP decomposition for (NP )T,y0

Remark 1.6. To make the BBP decomposition for (NP )T,y0 (i.e., the decomposition of
W given by Theorem 1.4) understood better, a draft is given in Figure 1. We explain it
as follows: The abscissa axis denotes the set X \ {0}, while the ordinates axis denotes the
set of time variables T > 0. Each pi (with i = 1, 2, 3, 4) on the abscissa axis is a “point”
of the set X \ {0}.

In ﬁgure 1, some notations are explained as follows:

14

• (p1, p2] denotes the set: {y0 ∈ X \ {0} : N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0}.

• (p2, p3) denotes the set: {y0 ∈ X \ {0} : 0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞}.

• [p3, p4) denotes the set: {y0 ∈ X \ {0} : N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞, T 0(y0) < ∞}.

• [p4, ∞) denotes the set: {y0 ∈ X \ {0} : N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞, T 0(y0) = ∞}.

• The two curves above the abscissa axis (from the left to the right) respectively denote
y0 ∈

y0 ∈ X \ {0} and y0 → T 0(y0),

the graph of the functions: y0 → T 1(y0),
X \ {0}. These two curves coincide over (p1, p2].

Let W1,j (j = 1, 2), W2,j (j = 1, 2, 3, 4), and W3,j (j = 1, 2, 3, 4) be given by (1.28), (1.30)
and (1.32), respectively. Then we conclude that

• The set W1,1 is the region {(T, y0) : y0 ∈ (p1, p2], 0 < T < T 0(y0)};

• The set W1,2 is the region {(T, y0) : y0 ∈ (p1, p2], T 0(y0) ≤ T < ∞};

• The set W2,1 is the region {(T, y0) : y0 ∈ (p2, p3), 0 < T < T 0(y0)};

• The set W2,2 is the region {(T, y0) : y0 ∈ (p2, p3), T = T 0(y0)};

• The set W2,3 is the region {(T, y0) : y0 ∈ (p2, p3), T 0(y0) < T < T 1(y0)};

• The set W2,4 is the region {(T, y0) : y0 ∈ (p2, p3), T 1(y0) ≤ T < ∞};

• The set W3,1 is the region {(T, y0) : y0 ∈ [p3, p4), 0 < T ≤ T 0(y0)};

• The set W3,2 is the region {(T, y0) : y0 ∈ [p3, p4), T 0(y0) < T < T 1(y0)};

• The set W3,3 is the region {(T, y0) : y0 ∈ [p3, p4), T 1(y0) ≤ T < ∞};

• The set W3,4 is the region {(T, y0) : y0 ∈ [p4, ∞), 0 < T < ∞};

• When {S(t)}t∈R+ has the backward uniqueness property, we have that T 1(y0) = ∞
for all y0 ∈ X \ {0}. In this case, the curve: {(y0, T 1(y0)) : y0 ∈ X \ {0}} will not
appear in Figure 1; W1,1 ∪ W1,2 ∪ W2,4 ∪ W3,3 = ∅ (see (iv) of Lemma 3.4).

To make the BBP decomposition for (T P )M,y0 (i.e., the decomposition of V given by
Theorem 1.5) understood better, a draft is given in Figure 2. We explain this ﬁgure as
follows: The abscissa axis denotes the set X \ {0}, while the ordinates axis denotes the
variables M > 0. Each pi, with i = 1, 2, 3, 4, on the abscissa axis is a “point” of the set
X \ {0}.

In ﬁgure 2, some notations are given in order.

• [p4, ∞) denotes the set: {y0 ∈ X \ {0} : N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞, T 0(y0) = ∞}.

• The two curves above the abscissa axis (denoted by F0 and F1 from the left to the
right) respectively denote the graphs of the functions: y0 → N(T 0(y0), y0), y0 ∈
X \ {0} and y0 → N(T 1(y0), y0), y0 ∈ X \ {0}. These two curves are identically
zero over (p1, p2].

Let V1, V2,j (j = 1, 2, 3, 4), and V3,j (j = 1, 2, 3) be given by (1.34), (1.35) and (1.37),
respectively. Then we have the following conclusions:

• The set V1 is the region {(M, y0) : y0 ∈ (p1, p2], 0 < M < ∞};

• The set V2,1 is the region {(M, y0) : y0 ∈ (p2, p3), 0 < M ≤ F1(y0)};

• The set V2,3 is the region {(M, y0) : y0 ∈ (p2, p3), M = F0(y0), M 6= F1(y0)};

• The set V2,4 is the region {(M, y0) : y0 ∈ (p2, p3), F0(y0) < M < ∞};

• The set V3,1 is the region {(M, y0) : y0 ∈ [p3, p4), 0 < M ≤ F1(y0)};

• The set V3,3 is the region {(M, y0) : y0 ∈ [p4, ∞), 0 < M < ∞}.

Remark 1.7. (i) The decomposition given by Theorem 1.4 is comparable with the decom-
position (P2) in Subsection 1.1, except for the part W2,2, which is indeed the following
“curve” in the product space W:

γ1 ,(cid:8)(T 0(y0), y0) ∈ W : 0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞(cid:9).

(1.39)

It is a critical curve in the following sense: First, we do not know if it is empty. Second,
when (T, y0) ∈ γ1, we know the corresponding (NP )T,y0 has at least one minimal norm
control, but we are not sure if it has the bang-bang property. It deserves to mention that
when (A, B) is L∞-null controllable, this curve is empty (see Theorem 1.9).

(ii) The decomposition given by Theorem 1.5 is comparable with the decomposition
(P1) in Subsection 1.1, except for the part V2,3, which is indeed the following “curve” in
the product space V:

γ2 ,(cid:26)(cid:0)N(T 0(y0), y0), y0(cid:1) ∈ V :

0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞,

N(T 0(y0), y0) 6= N(T 1(y0), y0) (cid:27) .

(1.40)

It is a critical curve in the BBP decomposition for (T P )M,y0 in the following sense: First,
we do not know if it is empty. Second, when (M, y0) ∈ γ2, we know the corresponding
(T P )M,y0 has a minimal time control, but we are not sure if it has the bang-bang property.
It deserves to mention that when (A, B) is L∞-null controllable, this curve is empty (see
Theorem 1.9).

Remark 1.8. In the ﬁnitely dimensional setting where (A, B) is a pair in Rn×n ×(Rn×m \
{0}), (with n, m ∈ N+), the BBP decompositions for (T P )M,y0 and (NP )T,y0, obtained in
Theorem 1.4 and Theorem 1.5, are exactly the same as (P1) and (P2) in Subsection 1.1.
This is proved in Appendix C (see Proposition 8.5).

Under the assumptions (H3) and (H4), the main results obtained in Theorem 1.4 and

Theorem 1.5 can be improved as follows:

Theorem 1.9. Let W and W3,j (j = 2, 3) be given by (1.26) and (1.32), respectively.
Let V and V3,j (j = 1, 2) be given by (1.27) and (1.37), respectively. Then the following
conclusions are true:
(i) Suppose that (H3) holds. Then

W = W3,2 ∪ W3,3 and V = V3,1 ∪ V3,2.

(1.41)

17

In particular,

γ1 = W2,2 = ∅ and γ2 = V2,3 = ∅.

(1.42)

where γ1, γ2, W2,2 and V2,3 are given respectively by (1.39), (1.40), (1.30) and (1.35).
(ii) Suppose that (H3) holds. Then for each (M, y0) ∈ V3,1, (T P )M,y0 has no any admis-
sible control and does not hold the bang-bang property. If further assume that (H4) holds,
then for each (M, y0) ∈ V3,2, (T P )M,y0 has the bang-bang property.
(iii) For each (T, y0) ∈ W3,3, the null control is the unique minimal norm control to
(NP )T,y0 and this problem has the bang-bang property. If further assume that (H3) and
(H4) hold, then for each (T, y0) ∈ W3,2, (NP )T,y0 has the bang-bang property and the null
control is not a minimal norm control to this problem.

1.4 The ideas to get the main results

The main diﬃculty to get the BBP decompositions of (T P )M,y0 and (NP )T,y0 is the lack
of the Kalman controllability decomposition. The ﬁrst key to overcome this diﬃculty is to
ﬁnd assumptions (H1) and (H2). Then with the aid of functions T 0(·), T 1(·) and N(·, y0),
we get the conclusions (i) in both Theorem 1.4 and Theorem 1.5. In the decomposition of
W, the part W2,2 = γ1 is a critical curve for us; the studies for the problem (NP )T,y0, with
(T, y0) ∈ W2,3∪W3,2, are not easy for us; when (T, y0) is in the rest parts, it is easy to prove
the corresponding conclusions in Theorem 1.4 for (NP )T,y0, through using properties of
functions T 0(·), T 1(·) and N(·, y0). The proof of the corresponding conclusion in Theorem
1.4 for (NP )T,y0, with (T, y0) ∈ W2,3 ∪ W3,2, is mainly based on a maximum principle
for (NP )T,y0, as well as (H2). To get the maximum principle, we build up the following
aﬃliated minimal norm problems:

(NP )yT

kyT kRT

, inf(cid:8)kvkL∞(0,T ;U )

: ˆy(T ; 0, v) = yT(cid:9),

where T ∈ (0, ∞) and yT is in the reachable subspace

(1.43)

(1.44)

RT ,(cid:8)ˆy(T ; 0, v) : v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U)(cid:9).

(In the problem (NP )yT , we can deﬁne the minimal norm, an admissible control, a minimal
norm control and the bang-bang property in the similar manner as in (NP )T,y0 (see (1.18)).
By the connection between (NP )yT and (NP )T,y0 built up in Proposition 2.13, we realized
that the maximum principle for (NP )T,y0 can be derived from a maximum principle for
(NP )yT . Though we are not able to get a maximum principle of (NP )yT for all yT ∈ RT ,
we get a maximum principle for (NP )yT , with yT in the subspace:

R0
T

,(cid:8)ˆy(T ; 0, v) : v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U), lim

s→T

18

kvkL∞(s,T ;U ) = 0(cid:9), T ∈ (0, ∞).

(1.45)

More precisely, we obtain that if (H1) holds, then for each yT ∈ R0
vector f ∗ ∈ YT \ {0} so that each minimal norm control v∗ to (NP )yT veriﬁes that

T \ {0}, there exists a

hv∗(t), f ∗(t)iU =

max

kwkU ≤kyT kRT

hw, f ∗(t)iU a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).

(1.46)

(This is exactly Theorem 5.1.) About (1.46), we would like to mention two facts: First, it
is not the standard Pontryagin maximum principle, since we are not sure if the function
f ∗ in (1.46) can be expressed as B∗ϕ with ϕ a solution of the adjoint equation, even in
the case that B ∈ L(U, X). Second, the proof of (1.46) is the most diﬃcult part in this
paper. It is based on two representation theorems (Theorem 2.3 and Theorem 2.8). From
(1.46) and the connection between (NP )yT and (NP )T,y0 built up in Proposition 2.13, we
get the maximum principle for (NP )T,y0, with (T, y0) ∈ W2,3 ∪ W3,2, which along with
(H2), yields that when (T, y0) ∈ W2,3 ∪ W3,2, (NP )T,y0 has the bang-bang property.

Regarding the decomposition of V, the part V2,3 = γ2 is a critical curve for us; the
studies for the problem (T P )M,y0, with (M, y0) ∈ V2,2 ∪ V3,2, are not easy for us; when
(M, y0) is in the rest parts, it is easy to prove the corresponding conclusions in Theorem
1.5 for (T P )M,y0, through using properties of functions T 0(·), T 1(·) and N(·, y0), as well
as the assumption (H1). The proof of the corresponding conclusion in Theorem 1.5 for
(T P )M,y0, with (M, y0) ∈ V2,2∪V3,2, is mainly based on a maximum principle for (T P )M,y0,
as well as (H2). This maximum principle follows from the above-mentioned maximum
principle for (NP )T,y0, with (T, y0) ∈ W2,3 ∪ W3,2, as well as the connection between
(T P )M,y0 and (NP )T,y0 built up in Lemma 5.4.

Remark 1.10. The reason to cause curves γ1 and γ2 to be critical is that in general, we
do not know if (NP )yT , with yT ∈ RT \ R0
T , has the maximum principle (1.46), under the
assumption (H1).

1.5 More about the bang-bang properties

To the best of our knowledge, there are two ways to derive the bang-bang property for
minimal time control problems governed by linear evolution systems, in general. The ﬁrst
one is the use of the L∞-null controllability from measurable sets. In [6, Section 2.1], H.
O. Fattorini studied the minimal time control problem for the abstract system:

y′(t) = Ay(t) + u(t), t > 0,

(1.47)

with A generating a C0-semigroup in a Banach space. This corresponds to (1.13) with
U = X and B = IdX (the identity operator on a Banach space X). By a constructive
method, he proved that the reachable sets of (1.47) have the following property: For
any subset E ⊂ (0, ∞) of positive measure, RT,E = RT for a.e. T ∈ E, where RT,E ,

19

{y(T ; 0, χEu) : u ∈ L∞(R+; U)}. From this property, he proved the bang-bang property
by a contradiction argument.
In [28], V. Mizel and T. Seidman pointed out that the
bang-bang property of minimal time control problems for linear time-invariant evolution
systems can be derived by the L∞-null controllability from measurable sets.
Indeed,
by this controllability and by a translation invariance which holds only for time invariant
systems, one can use a contradiction argument to prove the bang-bang property. However,
it seems for us that this way does not work for the case where controlled systems are
time-varying. In [43], the authors proved the bang-bang property of minimal time control
problems for some very special time-varying heat equations. To our best knowledge,
how to study the bang-bang property of minimal time control problems for general time-
varying systems is still a quite open problem. For studies on the L∞-null controllability
from measurable sets, we would like to mention the literatures [1, 28, 31, 32, 33, 40, 44, 48]
and the references therein.

The second way is the use of the Pontryagin maximum principle and the unique
continuation property from measurable sets in time. The key is to derive the Pontryagin
maximum principle. We would like to mention that the Pontryagin maximum principle
may not hold for some cases (see Example 1.4 on Page 132 in [20]).
In [6, Chapter
2], H. O. Fattorini studied the Pontryagin maximum principle for both minimal time and
minimal norm control problems, with an initial state ζ and a target state ¯y, for the system
(1.47). He ﬁrst proved the property that for each T > 0, D(A) is continuously embedded
into RT . Then, with the aid of this property, he divided the dual space of RT into the
regular part and the singular part. After that, he proved that if ¯y − S(T ∗)ζ ∈ D(A), then
¯y − S(T ∗)ζ and BRT ∗ (0, 1) can be separated by a hyperplane (in RT ∗), with a regular
normal vector. (Here, T ∗ is the minimal time, BRT ∗ (0, 1) is the closed unit ball in RT ∗
and the controls for the minimal time control problem are within L∞-norm not larger
than 1.) Finally, with the help of the aforementioned separating property, he obtained
the Pontryagin maximum principle. By the second way, one might get the bang-bang
property of minimal time control problems for the linear time-varying evolution systems
which hold some unique continuation property.

For the minimal norm control problems governed by linear time-varying evolution
systems, the L∞-null controllability from measurable sets implies the bang-bang property.
Though the paper [31] proves this only for heat equations with time-varying lower terms,
the method in [31] works for general linear time-varying evolution systems.

About studies on minimal time and minimal norm control problems, we would like to
mention the literatures [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,
28, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50] and the references therein.
The rest part of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 studies some properties
on the subspaces RT and R0
T . Section 3 shows some properties of functions N(·, y0), T 0(·)
and T 1(·). Section 4 studies the existence of minimal time and minimal norm controls.

Section 5 studies maximum principles and bang-bang properties. Section 6 proves the
main results. Section 7 gives some applications. Section 8 provides several appendixes.

2 Properties on attainable subspaces

In this section, we mainly study the properties on the subspaces RT and R0
T given by (1.44)
and (1.45), respectively. These properties mainly help us to get a maximum principle for
the aﬃliated minimal norm problem (NP )yT , with yT ∈ R0
T . The later is the base in the
proofs of (iii) of Theorem 1.4 and (ii) of Theorem 1.5.

2.1 The ﬁrst representation theorem

In this subsection, we will present a representation theorem on the space Y ∗
T which is the
dual space of YT (deﬁned by (1.22)). This theorem was built up for heat equations in [43,
(i) of Theorem 1.4]. To prove it, we need the following two results: Proposition 2.1 and
Lemma 2.2. Very similar versions of these two results are given in [5, Section 2.3.1]. For
the sake of the completeness of the paper, we give their proofs in Appendix D.

Proposition 2.1. The following equality is valid:

(cid:10)Z T

0

S−1(T − t)Bv(t) dt, z(cid:11)X =Z T

0

hv(t), B∗S∗(T − t)ziU dt

(2.1)

for all T ∈ (0, ∞), v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) and z ∈ D(A∗).

Lemma 2.2. For each T ∈ (0, ∞), there exists a positive constant C(T ) so that

Z T

kB∗S∗(T − τ )zk2

U dτ ≤ C(T )kzk2

X for all z ∈ D(A∗).

(2.2)

Theorem 2.3. For each T ∈ (0, ∞), there is a linear isomorphism ΦT from RT to Y ∗
T
so that for all yT ∈ RT and f ∈ YT ,

hyT , f iRT ,YT

, hΦT (yT ), f iY ∗

T ,YT =Z T

0

hv(t), f (t)iU dt,

(2.3)

where v is any admissible control to (NP )yT .

21

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a T ∈ (0, ∞). It follows from (2.2) that

B∗S∗(T − ·)z ∈ L1(0, T ; U) for each z ∈ D(A∗).

For each yT ∈ RT , deﬁne the following set of admissible controls to (NP )yT :

U yT
ad

, {v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) : ˆy(T ; 0, v) = yT }.

(2.4)

(2.5)

Observe from (1.44) and (2.5) that U yT
for each yT ∈ RT and each v ∈ U yT
each yT ∈ RT , z ∈ D(A∗) and each v ∈ U yT
ad ,

ad 6= ∅ for each yT ∈ RT , and that yT = ˆy(T ; 0, v)
ad . These, along with (1.15) and (2.4), yields that for

hyT , ziX = Z T

0

hv(t), B∗S∗(T − t)ziU dt

≤ kv(·)kL∞(0,T ;U )kB∗S∗(T − ·)zkL1(0,T ;U ).

(2.6)

Arbitrarily ﬁx a yT ∈ RT and then ﬁx a v1 ∈ U yT

ad . Then we deﬁne a map FyT : XT → R

in the following manner:

FyT(cid:0)B∗S∗(T − ·)z|(0,T )(cid:1) , Z T

0

hv1(t), B∗S∗(T − t)ziU dt for each z ∈ D(A∗), (2.7)

T

keFyT kY ∗

where XT is given by (1.23). Because of the ﬁrst equality in (2.6), we see from (2.7) that
the deﬁnition of FyT is independent of the choice of v1 ∈ U yT
ad . Thus it is well-deﬁned.
From (2.7), the inequality in (2.6) and (1.22), we ﬁnd that FyT can be uniquely extended
≤ kvkL∞(0,T ;U ) for all
ad . Since yT ∈ RT was arbitrarily ﬁxed, the above estimate, along with (1.43),

T . Furthermore, we have that keFyT kY ∗

to be an element eFyT ∈ Y ∗

v ∈ U yT
yields that

T

≤ inf{kvkL∞(0,T ;U )

: v ∈ U yT

ad } = kyT kRT for all yT ∈ RT .

(2.8)

We now deﬁne a map ΦT : RT −→ Y ∗

T in the following manner:

ΦT (yT ) = eFyT for each yT ∈ RT .

It is clear that ΦT is well deﬁned and linear. We claim that ΦT is surjective. Arbitrar-
ily take g ∈ Y ∗
T . Since YT ⊂ L1(0, T ; U) (see (1.22)), according to the Hahn-Banach

theorem, there exists a eg ∈ (cid:0)L1(0, T ; U)(cid:1)∗
that kegkL(L1(0,T ;U );R) = kgkY ∗

so that eg(ψ) = g(ψ) for all ψ ∈ YT ; and so
. Then by the Riesz representation theorem, there is bv in

L∞(0, T ; U) so that

T

(2.11)

Write ˆyT , ˆy(T ; 0,bv). Then ˆv ∈ U ˆyT

We now show that ΦT is injective. Let yT ∈ RT satisfy that eFyT = 0 in Y ∗

T , which, along with (2.9), shows that ΦT is surjective.
T . Then by
(2.7) and (2.6), we ﬁnd that hyT , ziX = 0 for all z ∈ D(A∗). Since D(A∗) is dense in X,
the above yields that yT = 0, which implies that ΦT is injective.

We next show that ΦT preserves norms. Let g ∈ Y ∗

T , where ˆyT = ˆy(T ; 0, ˆv), with ˆv ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) satisfying (2.10) and (2.11). This, along
Y ∗

T . Then we have that g = eFˆyT in

with (1.43) yields that kˆyT kRT ≤ keFˆyT kY ∗

T

Finally, (2.3) follows from (2.9), (2.7) and (1.22). This ends the proof of this theorem.

Remark 2.4. Since Y ∗
(RT , k · kRT ) is complete.

T is complete, it follows from Theorem 2.3 that the normed space

This subsection mainly presents a representation theorem on (R0

deﬁned by (1.22)). For this purpose, we need three lemmas.

T (deﬁned by (1.45)). This theorem gives an important property of YT (which is

Lemma 2.5. The following propositions are equivalent:
(i) The condition (H1) holds.
(ii) There is a p1 ∈ [2, ∞) so that for each T ∈ (0, ∞), each u ∈ Lp1(0, T ; U) and each
t ∈ (0, T ), there exists a control v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) satisfying that

ˆy(T ; 0, χ(t,T )v) = ˆy(T ; 0, χ(0,t)u) and kvkL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ C1kukLp1 (0,T ;U )

for some C1 , C1(T, t) > 0 (independent of u).
(iii) There is a p2 ∈ (1, 2] so that when 0 < t < T < ∞,

kgkLp2 (0,t;U ) ≤ C2kgkL1(t,T ;U ) for all g ∈ YT

for some C2 , C2(T, t) > 0 (independent of g).

Furthermore, when one of the above three propositions is valid, the constants p0 (given
in (H1)), p1 and p2 (given in (ii) and (iii), respectively) can be chosen so that p0 = p1 =
p2/(p2 − 1).

23

Proof. Our proof is organized by several steps as follows:
Step 1. To show that (i) ⇒ (ii)

Suppose that (H1) holds for some p0 ∈ [2, ∞). Let T and t satisfy that 0 < t < T < ∞.

Deﬁne two maps as follows:

L1 : Y , Lp0(0, T ; U) → X, L1(u) = ˆy(T ; 0, χ(0,t)u), u ∈ Y ;

L2 : Z , L∞(0, T ; U) → X, L2(v) = ˆy(T ; 0, χ(t,T )v), v ∈ Z.

By (1.16), we have that

ˆy(T ; 0, χ(0,t)u) =Z T
ˆy(T ; 0, χ(t,T )v) =Z T

0

0

S−1(T − τ )Bχ(0,t)(τ )u(τ ) dτ ;

S−1(T − τ )Bχ(t,T )(τ )v(τ ) dτ.

These, together with (1.12), indicate that both L1 and L2 are bounded. Moreover, by
(H1), we ﬁnd that

Range L1 ⊂ Range L2.

(2.12)

kπ(v)k bZ = inf(cid:8)kwkZ : w ∈ v + Ker L2(cid:9) for each v ∈ Z.

Let π : Z → bZ , Z/Ker L2 be the quotient map. Then π is surjective and it stands that
Deﬁne a map bL2 : bZ → X in the following manner:
One can easily check that bL2 is well deﬁned, linear and bounded. By (2.12) and (2.14),
we see that Range L1 ⊂ RangebL2. Thus, given u ∈ Y , there is a unique π(vu) ∈ bZ so
We now deﬁne another map T : Y → bZ by

L1(u) =bL2(π(vu)).

bL2(π(v)) = L2(v),

π(v) ∈ bZ.

T (u) = π(vu) for each u ∈ Y.

that

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

One can easily check that T is well deﬁned and linear. We next use the closed graph
theorem to show that T is bounded. For this purpose, we let {un} ⊂ Y satisfy that

un → u0

in Y and T (un) → h0

24

in bZ, as n → ∞.

Because L1 and bL2 are bounded, we ﬁnd from (2.16) and (2.15) that

L1(un) = L1u0.

bL2h0 = lim

n→∞bL2(T (un)) = lim

n→∞bL2(π(vun)) = lim

n→∞

This, together with (2.16), indicates that h0 = T (u0). Then by the closed graph theorem,
we see that T is bounded. Thus, by (2.16), there exists a C , C(T, t) > 0 so that

kπ(vu)k bZ = kT (u)k bZ ≤ CkukY for each u ∈ Y.

(2.17)

Meanwhile, it follows from (2.13) that for each v ∈ Z, there is a v′ ∈ v + Ker L2 so that
kv′kZ ≤ 2kπ(v)k bZ. Thus, by (2.15), (2.14) and (2.17), we ﬁnd that for each u ∈ Y , there
is a v′
ukZ ≤ 2CkukY . Hence, by the deﬁnitions of L1
and L2, we obtain (ii), with C1 = 2C and p1 = p0.

u ∈ Z so that L1(u) = L2(v′

u) and kv′

Step 2. To show that (ii) ⇒ (iii)

Suppose that (ii) holds for some p1 ∈ [2, ∞). Arbitrarily ﬁx T and t, with 0 < t <

T < ∞. Then for each u ∈ Lp1(0, T ; U), there is a control vu ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) so that

ˆy(T ; 0, χ(0,t)u) = ˆy(T ; 0, χ(t,T )vu) and kvukL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ C1kukLp1 (0,T ;U ),

where C1 , C1(T, t) is given by (ii). These, along with (1.15), yield that for each z ∈

1 and C2 = C1.

Suppose that (iii) holds for some p2 ∈ (1, 2]. Let p′

1/p2 + 1/p′
subspace of L1(t, T ; U):

Since B∗S∗(T −·)z|(0,T ) ∈ YT for all z ∈ D(A∗), it follows from (iii) that L3 is well deﬁned.

Since D(A∗) is dense in X, the above leads to (H1), with p0 = p′

From the proofs in Step 1-Step 3, we ﬁnd that p0, p1 and p2 can be chosen so that

p0 = p1 = p2/(p2 − 1), provided that one of the propositions (i)-(iii) holds.

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of this lemma.

26

Lemma 2.6. Let T ∈ (0, ∞). The following conclusions are true:
(i) If f ∈ YT , then f |(0,S) ∈ YS for each S ∈ (0, T ).
(ii) Suppose that (H1) holds. If f ∈ L1(0, T ; U) and f |(0,S) ∈ YS for each S ∈ (0, T ), then
f ∈ YT .

Proof. (i) Let f ∈ YT . Then by (1.22), there exists a subsequence {wn} ⊂ D(A∗) so that

B∗S∗(T − ·)wn → f (·) in L1(0, T ; U).

(2.21)

Arbitrarily ﬁx an S ∈ (0, T ). Since S∗(T − S)wn ∈ D(A∗) for all n, by making use of
(1.22) again, we ﬁnd that

B∗S∗(T − ·)wn|(0,S) = B∗S∗(S − ·)(cid:0)S∗(T − S)wn(cid:1)|(0,S) ∈ YS.

Since YS is closed in L1(0, S; U), the above, as well as (2.21), yields that f |(0,S) ∈ YS.

(ii) Suppose that (H1) holds. We organize the proof by the following steps:

(−1, s) so that

Step 1. To show that for each s ∈ (0, ∞) and gs ∈ Ys, there is a unique functionegs over
Let 0 < s < ∞ and gs ∈ Ys. We ﬁrst show the existence of suchegs. For this purpose,

egs(τ ) = gs(τ ) for all τ ∈ (0, s),

and egs(· − 1) ∈ Ys+1

we deﬁne the following subspace:

(2.22)

Xs ,(cid:8)gz(·) ∈ L1(0, s; U) : z ∈ D(A∗)(cid:9),

where gz(·) , B∗S∗(s−·)z over (0, s). Then deﬁne a map Fs : Xs → Ys+1 in the following
manner: For each z ∈ D(A∗),

(Fsgz) (τ ) , B∗S∗(s + 1 − τ )z, τ ∈ (0, s + 1).

From (2.23), we ﬁnd that for each z ∈ D(A∗),

(Fsgz)(τ + 1) = gz(τ ), τ ∈ (0, s).

(2.23)

(2.24)

Meanwhile, by (H1) and Lemma 2.5, we have the assertion (iii) of Lemma 2.5, which,
together with (2.23), yields that when z ∈ D(A∗),

(cid:13)(cid:13)Fs(cid:0)B∗S∗(s − ·)z|(0,s)(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:13)L1(0,s+1;U )

system). Hence, Fs is linear and bounded from Xs to Ys+1. Since Xs is dense in Ys (see

(1.22)), Fs can be uniquely extended to be a linear and bounded operatorfFs from Ys to

Ys+1. This, along with (2.24), yields that

(egs −bgs)(τ ) = 0 for all τ ∈ (0, s)

(2.27)

and

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.28)

(2.29)

From (2.27), we see that

(egs −bgs)(· − 1) ∈ Ys+1.

By (H1) and Lemma 2.5, we have (iii) of Lemma 2.5. This, along with (2.28), yields that

(egs −bgs)(τ − 1) = 0 for all τ ∈ (1, s + 1).

k(egs −bgs)(· − 1)kLp2 (0,1;U ) ≤ C2k(egs −bgs)(· − 1)kL1(1,s+1;U ),

where p2 and C2 are given by (iii) of Lemma 2.5. This, together with (2.29), implies

that (egs −bgs)(· − 1) = 0 over (0, s + 1). Hence, we have thategs(·) =bgs(·) over (−1, s).
This shows the uniqueness of suchegs(·) that satisﬁes (2.22). We call the aboveegs(·) the

Y -extension of gs(·).
Step 2. To show that f ∈ YT , when f ∈ L1(0, T ; U) and f |(0,S) ∈ YS for each S ∈ (0, T )

Let f ∈ L1(0, T ; U) satisfy that f |(0,S) ∈ YS for each S ∈ (0, T ). Given S ∈ (0, T ),
we write fS for the Y -extension of f |(0,S) over (−1, S) (see the conclusion of Step 1). We
claim that

fS1 = fS2 over (−1, 0), when 0 < S1 < S2 < T.

Here is the argument: on one hand, we let

¯f (τ ) , fS2(τ − 1), τ ∈ (0, S2 + 1).

(2.30)

28

By (2.30) and the deﬁnition of fS2 (see (2.22)), we ﬁnd that ¯f ∈ YS2+1. This, as well as
(i) in this lemma, yields that

(2.31)
By making use of (2.30) again, we see that ¯f|(0,S1+1)(τ ) = fS2|(−1,S1)(τ − 1) for each τ ∈
(0, S1 + 1). This, along with (2.31), indicates that

¯f |(0,S1+1) ∈ YS1+1.

fS2|(−1,S1)(· − 1) ∈ YS1+1.

(2.32)

Meanwhile, since fS2 = f over (0, S2), we have that fS2|(−1,S1)(τ ) = f |(0,S1)(τ ) for all
τ ∈ (0, S1). This, along with (2.32), indicates that fS2|(−1,S1)(·) is the Y -extension of
f |(0,S1)(·) over (−1, S1).

On the other hand, fS1 is also the Y -extension of f |(0,S1)(·) over (−1, S1). By the
uniqueness of the Y -extension, we see that fS1 = fS2|(−1,S1) over (−1, S1), which leads to
that fS1 = fS2 over (−1, 0). This ends the proof of the above claim.

Now we arbitrarily ﬁx an S0 ∈ (0, T ). Deﬁne a function ˆf : (−1, T ) → U by setting

ˆf (·) = f (·) over (0, T ); ˆf (·) = fS0(·) over

(−1, 0].

Because of the above-mentioned claim, we ﬁnd that

ˆf is independent of the choice of S0.

(2.33)

(2.34)

It is clear that ˆf ∈ L1(−1, T ; U). Take a sequence {Tk} ⊂ (0, T ) so that Tk ր T . Then
we see from the ﬁrst equality in (2.33) that

ˆf (· + Tk − T )|(0,T ) → ˆf (·) |(0,T )= f (·)

in L1(0, T ; U),

as k → ∞.

(2.35)

Meanwhile, for each k, since fTk(· − 1) ∈ YTk+1 (see (2.22)), by (1.22), there exists a
sequence {wk,n} ⊂ D(A∗) so that

Z Tk+1

0

kB∗S∗(Tk + 1 − t)wk,n − fTk(t − 1)kU dt → 0, as n → ∞.

Since fTk = ˆf over (−1, Tk) for each k (see (2.34) and (2.33)), the above yields that for
all k, with Tk + 1 ≥ T ,

kB∗S∗(Tk + 1 − t)wk,n − ˆf (t − 1)kU dt → 0, as n → ∞,

Tk+1−T

Z Tk+1
Z T

0

which implies that for all k, with Tk + 1 ≥ T ,

kB∗S∗(T − t)wk,n − ˆf (t + Tk − T )kU dt → 0, as n → ∞.

29

This, along with (1.22), indicates that

ˆf (· + Tk − T )|(0,T ) ∈ YT for all k with Tk + 1 ≥ T.

Since YT is closed in L1(0, T ; U), the above, together with (2.35), implies that f ∈ YT .

In summary, we complete the proof of this lemma.

Lemma 2.7. Let T ∈ (0, ∞). If f ∈ L1(0, T ; U) satisﬁes that

Z T

0

then f ∈ YT .

hf (t), u(t)iU dt = 0 for all u ∈(cid:8)v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) : ˆy(T ; 0, v) = 0(cid:9),

(2.36)

Proof. By contradiction, we suppose that for some T ∈ (0, ∞), there were a function
f ∈ L1(0, T ; U), with the property (2.36), so that f 6∈ YT . Then, by the Hahn-Banach

(2.37)

theorem, we could ﬁnd a functionbu ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) so that

second assertion in (2.37), leads to a contradiction. This ends the proof.

the ﬁrst assertion in (2.37), we ﬁnd that ˆy(T ; 0,bu) = 0, which, along with (2.36) and the

The following result is a representation theorem on (R0

T )∗, which plays an important

role in our study.

Theorem 2.8. Suppose that (H1) holds. Then for each T ∈ (0, ∞), there is a linear
isomorphism ΨT from YT to (R0

where v is any admissible control to (NP )yT .

Proof. Let 0 < T < ∞. Recall that R0
T , with the norm k · kRT , is a subspace of RT
(see (1.44) and (1.45)). According to Theorem 2.3, each g ∈ YT deﬁnes a linear bounded

functional bFg over R0

T (i.e., bFg ∈ (R0

T )∗), via

bFg(yT ) , hg, yT iYT ,RT , yT ∈ R0

(2.39)

where h·, ·iYT ,RT is given by (2.3). Then we deﬁne a map ΨT from YT to (R0

T )∗ by

ΨT (g) , bFg, g ∈ YT .

(2.40)

One can easily check that ΨT is linear. The rest of the proof is organized by three steps.
Step 1. To show that kgkYT = kΨT (g)kRT for all g ∈ R0
T

Let g ∈ YT be given. On one hand, from (2.39), we see that

so that

kgkL1(0,S;U ) = hg, ˆuSiL1(0,S;U ),L∞(0,S;U ) and kˆuSkL∞(0,S;U ) = 1.

(2.42)

Write euS for the zero extension of ˆuS over (0, T ). Then it follows from (1.45) that
ˆy(T ; 0,euS) ∈ R0

T . Now, by (2.42), (2.3), (2.39) and (1.43), one can directly check that

kgkL1(0,S;U ) = hg,euSiL1(0,T ;U ),L∞(0,T ;U ) = hg, ˆy(T ; 0,euS)iYT ,RT

which yields that kgkYT = kgkL1(0,T ;U ) ≤ kbFgk(R0

Step 2. To show that ΨT is surjective

Let ˆf ∈ (R0

T )∗. We aim to ﬁnd a ˆg ∈ YT so that

ˆf = ΨT (ˆg) in (R0

T )∗.

(2.43)

In what follows, for each u ∈ L∞(0, S; U), with S ∈ (0, T ), we denote by eu the zero
extension of u over (0, T ). Then it follows from (1.45) that ˆy(T ; 0,eu) ∈ R0

for each S ∈ (0, T ), a map G ˆf ,S from L∞(0, S; U) to R by setting

(2.44)

|G ˆf ,S(u)| ≤ k ˆf k(R0

T )∗kˆy(T ; 0,eu)kRT for each u ∈ L∞(0, S; U).

31

(2.45)

Arbitrarily ﬁx an S ∈ (0, T ). By (H1) and Lemma 2.5, we have (ii) of Lemma 2.5.
Thus, there exists a C1(T, S) > 0 so that for each u ∈ L∞(0, S; U), there is a control
ˆvu ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) verifying that

ˆy(T ; 0,eu) = ˆy(T ; 0, χ(S,T )ˆvu) and kˆvukL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ C1(T, S)keukLp1 (0,T ;U )

for some p1 ∈ [2, ∞). From the ﬁrst assertion in (2.46) and (1.43), we ﬁnd that

(2.46)

which, together with the second assertion in (2.46), indicates that

kˆy(T ; 0,eu)kRT ≤ kˆvukL∞(0,T ;U ),

This, as well as (2.45), yields that for each S ∈ (0, T ),

kˆy(T ; 0,eu)kRT ≤ C1(T, S)keukLp1 (0,S;U ) for all u ∈ L∞(0, S; U).

|G ˆf ,S(u)| ≤ C1(T, S)k ˆf k(R0

T )∗kukLp1 (0,S;U ) for all u ∈ L∞(0, S; U).

(2.47)

By (2.47) and the Hahn-Banach theorem, we can uniquely extend G ˆf ,S to be an element

in(cid:0)Lp1(0, S; U)(cid:1)∗

|G ˆf ,S(u)| ≤ C1(T, S)k ˆfk(R0

T )∗kukLp1 (0,S;U ) for all u ∈ Lp1(0, S; U).

(2.48)

From (2.48), using the Riesz representation theorem, we ﬁnd that for each S ∈ (0, T ),
there exists a gS ∈ Lp′

1(0, S; U), with 1/p1 + 1/p′

1 = 1, so that

G ˆf ,S(u) =Z S

0

hgS(t), u(t)iU dt for all u ∈ Lp1(0, S; U).

(2.49)

Next, arbitrarily ﬁx an S ∈ (0, T ). Then take v ∈ L∞(0, S; U) so that ˆy(T ; 0,ev) = 0.
(Here,ev is the zero extension of v over (0, T ).) By (2.49) and (2.44), we see that

hgS(t), v(t)iU dt = G ˆf ,S(v) = 0.

Z S

0

This, along with Lemma 2.7, yields that

gS ∈ YS

for each S ∈ (0, T ).

(2.50)

Meanwhile, from (2.49), (2.45) and (1.43), one can easily check that for each u ∈ L∞(0, S; U),

(2.51)

We now deﬁne a function ˆg : (0, T ) → U in the following manner: For each S ∈ (0, T ),

ˆg(t) , gS(t) for all t ∈ (0, S).

(2.52)

The map ˆg is well deﬁned on (0, T ). In fact, when 0 < S1 < S2 < T , it follows from (2.49)
and (2.44) that for each u ∈ L∞(0, S1; U),

which implies that gS1(·) = gS2(·) over (0, S1). So one can check from (2.52) that ˆg is well
deﬁned. By (2.52) and (2.51), we see that

Since (H1) was assumed, from (2.53), (2.52), (2.50) and (ii) of Lemma 2.6, we ﬁnd that

kˆgkL1(0,T ;U ) ≤ k ˆf k(R0

T )∗.

(2.53)

ˆg ∈ YT and kˆgkYT ≤ k ˆf k(R0

By (2.44), (2.49) and (2.52), we deduce that for each S ∈ (0, T ),

yT = ˆy(T ; 0, uyT ) and lim

From these and (1.43), one can check that

which implies that

= kˆy(T ; 0, χ(S,T )uyT )kRT ≤ kuyT kL∞(S,T ;U ) → 0, as S → T,

ˆy(T ; 0, χ(0,S)uyT ) → yT in RT , as S → T.

Notice that ˆy(T ; 0, χ(0,S)uyT ) ∈ R0
the dominated convergence theorem, we ﬁnd that for each yT ∈ R0

which, together with (2.40), leads to (2.43). So ΨT is surjective.

Step 3. To show the second equality in (2.38)

The second equality in (2.38) follows from (2.40), (2.39) and (2.3) (in Theorem 2.3).

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of this theorem.

Remark 2.9. We do not know whether R0

T is a closed subspace of RT in general.

Corollary 2.10. Suppose that (H1) holds. Then for each T ∈ (0, ∞), BYT (the closed
unit ball in YT ) is compact in the topology σ(YT , R0

T ) (i.e., weak star compact).

Proof. By Theorem 2.8, we have that YT = (R0
BYT is compact in the topology σ(YT , R0

T ). This ends the proof.

T )∗. Then by the Banach-Alaoglu theorem,

2.3 Further studies on attainable subspaces

The following Lemma presents the non-triviality of the subspaces YT and R0
T , with T ∈
(0, ∞). (Consequently, RT is also non trivial.) Here, we will use the assumption that the
control operator B is non-trivial.

Lemma 2.11. Let 0 < T < ∞. Then the sets YT \ {0} and R0

T \ {0} are nonempty.

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a T ∈ (0, ∞). We ﬁrst show that YT \ {0} 6= ∅. Seeking for a
contradiction, we suppose that YT \ {0} = ∅. Since XT ⊂ YT (see (1.22)), we could derive
from (1.23) that for each z ∈ D(A∗), B∗S∗(T −·)z = 0 over (0, T ). Since {S∗(t)|D(A∗)}t∈R+
is a C0-semigroup on D(A∗) and B∗ ∈ L(D(A∗), U), the above yields that for each t ∈

34

[0, T ] and each z ∈ D(A∗), B∗S∗(T − t)z = 0. Taking t = T in above equality leads
to that B∗z = 0 for all z ∈ D(A∗), i.e., B∗ = 0, which contradicts the assumption that
B 6= 0. Thus we have proved that YT \ {0} 6= ∅.

We next verify that the set R0

T \ {0} is nonempty. By contradiction, suppose that it

was not true. Then we would have that

R0

T \ {0} = ∅,

i.e., R0

T = {0}.

(2.57)

Arbitrarily ﬁx an ε ∈ (0, T ). We ﬁnd from (1.45) that ˆy(T ; 0,ev) ∈ R0
L∞(0, ε; U), where ev denotes the zero extension of v over (0, T ). This, together with

(2.57) and (1.15), yields that for all z ∈ D(A∗) and v ∈ L∞(0, ε; U),

T for all v ∈

Z T

0

hB∗S∗(T − t)z,ev(t)iU dt = hz, ˆy(T ; 0,ev)iX = 0.

From the above, we ﬁnd that for each z ∈ D(A∗), B∗S∗(T − ·)z = 0 over (0, ε). Since ε
was arbitrarily taken from (0, T ), the above indicates that B∗S∗(T − ·)z = 0 over (0, T ),
for each z ∈ D(A∗). From this and (1.23), we ﬁnd that XT = {0}, which, along with
(1.22), indicates that YT = {0}. This leads to a contradiction, since we have proved that
YT \ {0} 6= ∅. Therefore, R0

T \ {0} 6= ∅. Thus, we end the proof of this lemma.

The next result presents an expression on the norm k · kRT .

Proposition 2.12. Let 0 < T < ∞. Write

ˆZT ,(cid:8)z ∈ D(A∗) : B∗S∗(T − ·)z 6= 0 in L1(0, T ; U)(cid:9).

Then it stands that

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx T ∈ (0, ∞). First of all, we notice that ˆZT 6= ∅. Indeed, if it was
not true, then by (1.23), we would have that XT = {0}, which, along with (1.22), yields
that YT = {0}. This contradicts Lemma 2.11. So we have proved that ˆZT 6= ∅.
T . It is clear that

To this end, we arbitrarily take yT ∈ RT and then ﬁx v ∈ U yT
by (2.5) that U yT
is a sequence {zn} in D(A∗) so that

ad . (Since yT ∈ RT , it follows
ad 6= ∅.) On one hand, given f ∈ YT \ {0}, it follows by (1.22) that there

B∗S∗(T − ·)zn → f (·) in L1(0, T ; U).

Since f 6= 0, we see from (2.61) that when n is large enough,

B∗S∗(T − ·)zn 6= 0 in L1(0, T ; U),

i.e., zn ∈ ˆZT .

(2.61)

(2.62)

(2.66)

Finally, (2.60) follows from (2.63) and (2.66). This, along with (2.59), proves (2.58).

We end the proof of this proposition.

The following proposition is about the relation between (NP )yT and (NP )T,y0 with

yT = −S(T )y0.

Proposition 2.13. Let y0 ∈ X and T ∈ (0, ∞) satisfy that −S(T )y0 ∈ RT . Then the
following conclusions are valid:
(i) Any admissible control to (NP )yT (with yT , −S(T )y0) is an admissible control to
(NP )T,y0. And the reverse is also true.
(ii) k − S(T )y0kRT = N(T, y0).
(iii) Any minimal norm control to (NP )yT (with yT = −S(T )y0) is a minimal norm
control to (NP )T,y0. And the reverse is also true.

Proof. (i) Let ˆv be an admissible control to (NP )yT , with yT , −S(T )y0. Then it follows
from (1.43) that ˆy(T ; 0, ˆv) = −S(T )y0, which yields that ˆy(T ; y0, ˆv) = 0. This, along with
(1.18), implies that ˆv is an admissible control to (NP )T,y0.

Conversely,

if ev is an admissible control to (NP )T,y0, then by (1.18), we see that
ˆy(T ; y0,ev) = 0, which yields that ˆy(T ; 0,ev) = −S(T )y0. This, along with (1.43), indicates
thatev is an admissible control to (NP )yT , with yT = −S(T )y0.

(ii) By (1.18) and (1.43), one can directly check that N(T, y0) = k − S(T )y0kRT .
(iii) Let v∗ be a minimal norm control to (NP )yT , with yT = −S(T )y0. Then by (i)

of this proposition, v∗ is an admissible control to (NP )T,y0, i.e.,

ˆy(T ; y0, v∗) = 0.

(2.67)

Meanwhile, by the optimality of v∗, we have that kv∗kL∞(0,T ;U ) = k − S(T )y0kRT , which,
along with (ii) of this proposition, shows that

kv∗kL∞(0,T ;U ) = N(T, y0).

(2.68)

By (2.67) and (2.68), we see that v∗ is a minimal norm control to (NP )T,y0.

Similarly, we can show the reverse. Thus, we ﬁnish the proof of this proposition.

Corollary 2.14. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy that T 0(y0) < ∞. Write

ˆZT ,(cid:8)z ∈ D(A∗) : B∗S∗(T − ·)z 6= 0 in L1(0, T ; U)(cid:9), 0 < T < ∞.

Then for each T ∈(cid:0)T 0(y0), ∞(cid:1),

N(T, y0) = sup

(2.69)

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx T ∈ (cid:0)T 0(y0), ∞(cid:1). At the start of the proof of Proposition 2.12,

we already proved that ˆZs 6= ∅ for each s ∈ (0, ∞). Since T > T 0(y0), by (1.19),
there exists a control u ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) so that ˆy(T ; y0, u) = 0. This, along with (1.44),
yields that −S(T )y0 = ˆy(T ; 0, u) ∈ RT , which, together with (ii) of Proposition 2.13 and
Proposition 2.12, leads to (2.69). We end the proof.

Proof. Let 0 < T < ∞. We ﬁrst prove that

(2.70)

Let yT ∈ BRT . From (1.43), there exists a sequence {vk} so that for all k ∈ N+,

yT = ˆy(T ; 0, vk) and kyT kRT ≤ kvkkL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ kyT kRT + 1/k.

(2.71)

For each k ∈ N+, we set

λk ,

kyT kRT

kyT kRT + 1/k

and uk , χ(0,T −1/k)λkvk.

It is clear that

kukkL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ kyT kRT ≤ 1 for all k ∈ N+.

From (1.45), (2.72), (1.43) and (2.73), we can easily check that

ˆy(T ; 0, uk) ∈ BR0

T

for all k ∈ N+.

38

(2.72)

(2.73)

(2.74)

Meanwhile, from (2.71), (2.3) and (2.72), we ﬁnd that for each f ∈ YT ,

(cid:10)ˆy(T ; 0, uk) − yT , f(cid:11)RT ,YT

= (cid:10)ˆy(T ; 0, uk − vk), f(cid:11)RT ,YT
= Z T

0 (cid:10)uk(t) − vk(t), f (t)(cid:11)U dt → 0, as k → ∞.

This, along with (2.74), yields that yT ∈ B
BRT , the above leads (2.70).

We next show that

σ(RT ,YT )

BRT ⊇ B

(2.75)

For this purpose, we let yT ∈ RT and {yn} ⊂ BR0

T

so that

yn → yT in the topology σ(RT , YT ), as n → ∞.

Since RT = Y ∗

T (see Theorem 2.3), we ﬁnd that

yn → yT in the weak star topology, as n → ∞.

Hence,

kyT kRT ≤ lim inf
n→∞

kynkRT ≤ 1,

which yields that yT ∈ BRT . This proves (2.75).

Finally, it follows from (2.70) and (2.75) that BRT = B

. This ends the proof.

The following lemma mainly shows that the reachable subspaces RT and R0

T are

independent of T ∈ (0, ∞), provided that the condition (H1) holds.

Proposition 2.16. Suppose that (H1) holds. Let 0 < T1 < T2 < ∞. Then the following
conclusions are valid:
(i) The spaces RT1 and RT2 are same, and the norms k · kRT1
(ii) The spaces R0

and k · kRT2

are equivalent.

T1 and R0

T2 are same.

Proof. Suppose that (H1) holds. Arbitrarily ﬁx 0 < T1 < T2 < ∞. We will prove the
conclusions (i)-(ii) one by one.

(i) Arbitrarily ﬁx yT1 ∈ RT1 and k ∈ N+. Then by (1.44) and (1.43), there exists a

control uyT1

∈ L∞(0, T1; U) so that

yT1 = ˆy(T1; 0, uyT1

) and kuyT1

kL∞(0,T1;U ) ≤ kyT1kRT1

+ 1/k.

(t − T2 + T1),

t ∈ (0, T2 − T1],
t ∈ (T2 − T1, T2).

(2.77)

Then from (1.16), the ﬁrst equality in (2.76) and (2.77), one can easily check that yT1 =
), which, along with (1.44), (1.43), (2.77) and the second inequality in (2.76),
ˆy(T2; 0, ˆuyT1
≤ kyT1kRT1
yields that yT1 ∈ RT2 and kyT1kRT2
+ 1/k. Since k was arbitrarily taken from
N+, the above implies that for each yT1 ∈ RT1,

yT1 ∈ RT2 and kyT1kRT2

≤ kyT1kRT1

.

(2.78)

Conversely, arbitrarily ﬁx yT2 ∈ RT2 and k ∈ N+. Then by (1.44) and (1.43), there

exists a control uyT2

∈ L∞(0, T2; U) so that

yT2 = ˆy(T2; 0, uyT2

) and kuyT2

kL∞(0,T2;U ) ≤ kyT2kRT2

+ 1/k.

(2.79)

By (H1), we can apply Lemma 2.5 to get the conclusion (ii) of Lemma 2.5 with some
∈ Lp1(0, T2; U), it follows from (ii) of Lemma 2.5
p1 ∈ [2, ∞). Because χ(0,T2−T1)uyT2

and

(2.81)

Then, by the ﬁrst assertion in (2.79) and (2.80), one can directly check that yT2 =

where C1 , C1(T2, T2 − T1) is given by (ii) of Lemma 2.5. Deﬁne a controlev(·) by setting
ˆy(T1; 0,ev), which, together with (1.44), (1.43), (2.81) and the inequality in (2.79), in-

(t + T2 − T1) + ˆv(t + T2 − T1), t ∈ (0, T1).

ev(t) , uyT2

dicates that

yT2 ∈ RT1 and kyT2kRT1

≤ (1 + C1(T2)1/p1)(cid:0)kyT1kRT2

+ 1/k(cid:1).

Since k was arbitrarily taken from N+, the above implies that for each yT2 ∈ RT2,

yT2 ∈ RT1 and kyT2kRT1

≤ (1 + C1(T2)1/p1)kyT2kRT2

.

(2.82)

Now, the conclusion (i) follows from (2.78) and (2.82).

(ii) By a very similar way as that used in the proof of the conclusion (i), we can show

that R0

T1 = R0

T2.

In summary, we end the proof of this proposition.

3 Properties of several functions

This section presents some properties on functions N(·, y0) (with y0 ∈ X \ {0}), T 0(·) and
T 1(·), which are deﬁned by (1.18), (1.19) and (1.20), respectively. The decompositions of
W and V (given in (i) of Theorem 1.4 and (i) of Theorem 1.5, respectively) are based on
these properties. We begin with the following Lemma 3.1. Since the exactly same result
as that in this lemma was not found by us in literatures (but the proof for the similar
result to Lemma 3.1 can be found in, for instance, [7, Lemma 1.1]), we give its proof in
Appendix E, for the sake of the completeness of the paper.

Lemma 3.1. Let {Tn}∞

n=1 ⊂ [0, ∞) and {un}∞

n=1 ⊂ L2(R+; U) satisfy that

for some bT ∈ [0, ∞) and ˆu ∈ L2(R+; U). Then for each y0 ∈ X,

Tn → bT and un → ˆu weakly in L2(R+; U), as n → ∞
y(Tn; y0, un) → y(bT ; y0, ˆu) weakly in X, as n → ∞.

The next lemma concerns the monotonicity of the function N(·, y0).

(3.1)

(3.2)

Lemma 3.2. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0}. Then the following conclusions are true:
(i) The function N(·, y0) is decreasing from (0, ∞) to [0, ∞].
(ii) The function N(·, y0), when extended over [0, ∞] via (1.21), is decreasing from [0, ∞]
to [0, ∞].

Proof. (i) We ﬁrst show that N(·, y0) is decreasing over (0, ∞). For this purpose, let T1
and T2 satisfy that 0 < T1 < T2 < ∞. There are only two possibilities on N(T1, y0):
either N(T1, y0) = ∞ or N(T1, y0) < ∞.

In the case that N(T1, y0) = ∞, it is obvious that N(T1, y0) ≥ N(T2, y0). In the case
that N(T1, y0) < ∞, we arbitrarily ﬁx a ε > 0. It follows from (1.18) that there exists

zero extension of vε over (0, T2). Then from the above, we ﬁnd that

a control vε so that ˆy(T1; y0, vε) = 0 and kvεkL∞(0,T1;U ) ≤ N(T1, y0) + ε. Writeevε for the
From the ﬁrst equality in (3.3), it follows that evε is an admissible control to (NP )T2,y0.

ˆy(T2; y0,evε) = 0 and kevεkL∞(0,T2;U ) = kvεkL∞(0,T1;U ) ≤ N(T1, y0) + ε.

This, along with the optimality of N(T2, y0) and the second assertion in (3.3), yields that

(3.3)

Since ε was arbitrarily taken, the above leads to the following inequality in this case:
N(T1, y0) ≥ N(T2, y0). Hence, the function N(·, y0) is decreasing over (0, ∞).

N(T2, y0) ≤ kevεkL∞(0,T2;U ) ≤ N(T1, y0) + ε.

41

Next, by (1.18), we see that 0 ≤ N(T, y0) ≤ ∞ for all T ∈ (0, ∞). Thus, the conclusion

(i) of this lemma has been proved.

(ii) The conclusion (ii) follows from the conclusion (i) of this lemma and (1.21).
In summary, we end the proof of this lemma.

The following two lemmas concern with some relations among N(·, y0), T 0(·) and T 1(·).

N(T 1(y0), y0) = N(∞, y0).

Lemma 3.3. Let y0 ∈ X\{0}. Then the following conclusions are true:

(i) T 0(y0) ≤ T 1(y0). (ii) T 1(y0) > 0. (iii) N(T, y0) > 0 for all T ∈ (cid:0)0, T 1(y0)(cid:1). (iv)
N(0, y0) = ∞. (v) If T 1(y0) < ∞, then N(T, y0) = 0 for all T ∈ (cid:2)T 1(y0), ∞(cid:3). (vi)
we assume, by contradiction, that T 0(y0) > T 1(y0). Fix a T ∈ (cid:0)T 1(y0), T 0(y0)(cid:1). Then

Proof. (i) There are only two possibilities on T 0(y0): either T 0(y0) = 0 or T 0(y0) > 0. In
the case that T 0(y0) = 0, it is clear that T 0(y0) ≤ T 1(y0). In the case when T 0(y0) > 0,

by (1.19), we would have that for all u ∈ L∞(0, T ; U), ˆy(T ; y0, u) 6= 0; and by (1.20),
we would have that ˆy(T ; y0, 0) = S(T )y0 = 0. These lead to a contradiction. Hence,
T 0(y0) ≤ T 1(y0).

(ii) By contradiction, suppose that T 1(y0) = 0. Then by (1.20), we could have that
for each ˆt > 0, S(ˆt)y0 = 0, which yields that y0 = limt→0+ S(t)y0 = 0. This leads to a
contradiction, since we assumed that y0 ∈ X \ {0}. Hence, T 1(y0) > 0.

(iii) By contradiction, suppose that N(T0, y0) = 0 for some T0 ∈(cid:0)0, T 1(y0)(cid:1). Then by

(1.18), there would be a sequence {vn} in L∞(0, T0; U) so that

ˆy(T0; y0, vn) = 0 for all n ∈ N+; and kvnkL∞(0,T0;U ) → 0, as n → ∞.

From these and Lemma 3.1, we ﬁnd that S(T0)y0 = ˆy(T0; y0, 0) = 0. From the above and

(1.20), we see that T 1(y0) ≤ T0, which leads to a contradiction, since T0 ∈ (cid:0)0, T 1(y0)(cid:1).
Hence, N(T, y0) > 0 for all T ∈(cid:0)0, T 1(y0)(cid:1).

(iv) By contradiction, suppose that N(0, y0) < ∞. Then by (ii) of Lemma 3.2, we

could ﬁnd a sequence {Tn} ⊂ R+ so that

Tn ց 0, as n → ∞

(3.4)

and

(3.5)
By (3.5) and (1.18), we see that for each n ∈ N+, (NP )Tn,y0 has an admissible control

N(Tn, y0) ≤ N(0, y0) < ∞ for all n ∈ N+.

n ∈ N+. Then we have that

un so that kunkL∞(0,Tn;U ) ≤ N(0, y0) + 1. Write eun for the zero extension of un over R+,

y(Tn; y0,eun) = 0 for all n ∈ N+

42

(3.6)

and

From (3.4) and (3.7), we see that

keunkL∞(R+;U ) = kunkL∞(0,Tn;U ) ≤ N(0, y0) + 1 for all n ∈ N+.

From (3.4), (3.8) and Lemma 3.1, we ﬁnd that

χ(0,Tn)eun → 0 strongly in L2(R+; U) as n → ∞.
y(Tn; y0, χ(0,Tn)eun) → y(0; y0, 0) = y0 weakly in X,

This, along with (3.6), yields that y0 = 0, which leads to a contradiction, since it was
assumed that y0 ∈ X \ {0}. So we have proved that N(0, y0) = ∞.

as n → ∞.

(v) Assume that T 1(y0) < ∞. We ﬁrst claim that

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

N(T, y0) = 0 for each T ∈(cid:2)T 1(y0), ∞(cid:1).

By contradiction, we suppose that N(T1, y0) 6= 0 for some T1 ∈ [T 1(y0), ∞). Then we
would have that ˆy(T1; y0, 0) 6= 0, i.e., S(T1)y0 6= 0. By the continuity of the function
t → S(t)y0 at T1, there is a δ > 0 so that S(T1 + δ)y0 6= 0, which implies that for each
t ∈ [0, T1 + δ], S(t)y0 6= 0. This, together with (1.20), implies that

T1 + δ ≤ T 1(y0).

(3.10)

However, we had that T1 ≥ T 1(y0) and δ > 0. These contradict (3.10). So (3.9) is proved.
Next, we see from the ﬁrst equality in (1.21) and (3.9) that N(∞, y0) = 0. This,

together with (3.9), proves the conclusion (v).

(vi) There are only two possibilities on T 1(y0): either T 1(y0) = ∞ or T 1(y0) < ∞. In
the case when T 1(y0) = ∞, it is clear that N(T 1(y0), y0) = N(∞, y0). In the case that
T 1(y0) < ∞, we see from (v) in this lemma that

N(T 1(y0), y0) = 0 = N(∞, y0).

(3.11)

This implies that N(T 1(y0), y0) = N(∞, y0) in this case.

In summary, we end the proof of this lemma.

Lemma 3.4. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0}. Then the following conclusions are true:
(i) If N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞, then either T 0(y0) < T 1(y0) or T 0(y0) = T 1(y0) = ∞.
(ii) If T 0(y0) = ∞, then N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞.
(iii) If 0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞, then T 0(y0) < T 1(y0).
(iv) N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0 if and only if T 0(y0) = T 1(y0) < ∞.
(v) If T 0(y0) < ∞, then N(T 1(y0), y0) < ∞.

43

Proof. (i) By contradiction, we suppose that the conclusion (i) was not true. Then, by
(i) of Lemma 3.3, we would have that

N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞ and T 0(y0) = T 1(y0) < ∞.

(3.12)

The second conclusion in (3.12), along with (v) of Lemma 3.3, yields that N(T 0(y0), y0) =
N(T 1(y0), y0) = 0. This contradicts the ﬁrst equality in (3.12). So the conclusion (i) is
true.

(ii) Assume that T 0(y0) = ∞. Then we ﬁnd from (1.19) that when T ∈ (0, ∞),
ˆy(T ; y0, u) 6= 0 for all u ∈ L∞(0, T ; U). Thus, for each T ∈ (0, ∞), (NP )T,y0 has no any
admissible control. So we have that N(T, y0) = ∞ for all T ∈ (0, ∞). Since T 0(y0) = ∞,
the above, as well as the ﬁrst equality in (1.21), indicates that

N(T 0(y0), y0) = N(∞, y0) = lim
T →∞

N(T, y0) = ∞.

This ends the proof of the conclusion (ii).

(iii) Assume that 0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞. Suppose, by contradiction, that the conclu-

sion (iii) was not true. Then, by (i) of Lemma 3.3, we would have that

0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞ and T 0(y0) = T 1(y0).

(3.13)

These, along with (ii) of this lemma, yield that T 1(y0) = T 0(y0) < ∞. Then by (v) of
Lemma 3.3, we see that N(T 0(y0), y0) = N(T 1(y0), y0) = 0, which contradicts the ﬁrst
conclusion in (3.13). Hence, the conclusion (iii) is true.

(iv) We ﬁrst show that

T 0(y0) = T 1(y0) < ∞ ⇒ N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0.

(3.14)

Suppose that the assertion on left side of (3.14) holds. Then by (v) of Lemma 3.3, we see
that N(T 0(y0), y0) = N(T 1(y0), y0) = 0, which leads to the equality on the right side of
(3.14).

We next show that

N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0 ⇒ T 0(y0) = T 1(y0).

(3.15)

By contradiction, we suppose that (3.15) did not hold. Then by (i) of Lemma 3.3, we
would have that

N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0 and T 0(y0) < T 1(y0).

(3.16)

In the case that T 0(y0) = 0, we ﬁnd from (iv) of Lemma 3.3 that N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞,
which contradicts the ﬁrst equality in (3.16). In the case that T 0(y0) > 0, we see from

44

the second inequality of (3.16) and (iii) of Lemma 3.3 that N(T 0(y0), y0) > 0, which
contradicts the ﬁrst equality in (3.16). Hence, (3.15) is true.

Finally, the conclusion (iv) follows from (3.14) and (3.15).
(v) Assume that T 0(y0) < ∞. There are only two possibilities on T 1(y0): either
T 1(y0) < ∞ or T 1(y0) = ∞. In the ﬁrst the case that T 1(y0) < ∞, we can apply the
conclusion (v) of Lemma 3.3 to ﬁnd that N(T 1(y0), y0) = 0 < ∞. Hence, the conclusion
(v) holds in the ﬁrst case. We now consider the second case that T 1(y0) = ∞. Because

T 0(y0) < ∞, we can take ˆt ∈(cid:0)T 0(y0), ∞(cid:1). Then by (1.19), we ﬁnd that ˆy(ˆt; y0, ˆu) = 0

for some ˆu ∈ L∞(0, ˆt; U). This shows that ˆu is an admissible control to (NP )ˆt,y0, from
which, we see that

N(ˆt, y0) < ∞.

(3.17)

Because T 1(y0) = ∞, it follows from (ii) of Lemma 3.2 and (3.17) that

N(T 1(y0), y0) = N(∞, y0) ≤ N(ˆt, y0) < ∞.

Hence, the conclusion (v) of this Lemma holds in the second case.

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of this lemma.

Remark 3.5. (i) Let y0 ∈ X \ {0}. From the above lemma, we have the following
two observations: (a) T 0(y0) < T 1(y0) if and only if either 0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞
or N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞ and T 0(y0) < ∞; (b) T 0(y0) = T 1(y0) if and only if either
N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0 or N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞ and T 0(y0) = ∞.

(ii) From the above two observations and the deﬁnitions of W2,3, W3,2, V2,2 and V3,2

(see (1.30), (1.32), (1.35) and (1.37), respectively), one can easily ﬁnd that

W2,3 ∪ W3,2 = {(T, y0) ∈ W : T 0(y0) < T < T 1(y0)}

and

V2,2 ∪ V3,2 = {(M, y0) ∈ V : N(T 1(y0), y0) < M < N(T 0(y0), y0)}.

The next Proposition 3.6 presents the strict monotonicity and the continuity for the

function N(·, y0) over(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1). These properties will help us to build up a connec-

tion between minimal time control problems and minimal norm control problems. This
connection plays an important role in the studies of the maximum principle for (T P )M,y0.
We would like to mention what follows: The properties in Proposition 3.6 was proved in
[46] for the internally controlled heat equation, with the aid of the bang-bang property
and the L∞-null controllability. Here, we have neither the bang-bang property nor the
L∞-null controllability. We prove it under a weaker condition (H1).

45

Proposition 3.6. Suppose that (H1) holds. Let y0 ∈ X \{0} satisfy that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0).
Then the following conclusions are true:

(i) The function N(·, y0) is continuous and strictly decreasing from(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1) onto
(cid:0)N(T 1(y0), y0), N(T 0(y0), y0)(cid:1).
(ii) When T ∈(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1),

N(t1, y0) > N(T, y0) > N(t2, y0) for all t1, t2 with 0 ≤ t1 < T < t2 ≤ ∞.

(3.18)

Proof. (i) Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X \ {0} so that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0). From (iii) of Lemma 3.3
and Corollary 2.14, we see that

(3.19)

0 < N(T, y0) < ∞ for all T ∈(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1).

We organize the rest of the proof by the following three steps:

Step 1. To show that the function N(·, y0) is strictly decreasing over(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1)

Arbitrarily ﬁx two numbers T1 and T2 so that T 0(y0) < T1 < T2 < T 1(y0). Because
(H1) holds, we can apply Lemma 2.5 to get the conclusion (ii) of Lemma 2.5. Let p1 ∈
[2, ∞) and C1 , C1(T2, T1) be given by (ii) of Lemma 2.5. Then by (3.19), there is a
δ > 0 so that

λ ,

N(T1, y0) + δ

∈ (0, 1) and C1λT 1/p1

1 ≤

N(T1, y0) − δ
N(T1, y0) + δ

.

(3.20)

Meanwhile, by (3.19), we have that N(T1, y0) < ∞. This, along with (1.18), yields that
there exists an admissible control v1 to (NP )T1,y0 so that

ˆy(T1; y0, v1) = 0 and kv1kL∞(0,T1;U ) ≤ N(T1, y0) + δ.

(3.21)

a control v2 ∈ L∞(0, T2; U) so that

Writeev1 for the zero extension of v1 over (0, T2). According to (ii) of Lemma 2.5, there is

(3.22)

(3.23)

(3.24)

and so that

We now deﬁne another control:

ˆy(T2; 0, χ(0,T1)λev1) = ˆy(T2; 0, χ(T1,T2)v2)
kv2kL∞(0,T2;U ) ≤ C1kλev1kLp1 (0,T2;U ) ≤ C1λT 1/p1
v3(t) , χ(0,T1)(t)(1 − λ)ev1(t) + χ(T1,T2)(t)v2(t), t ∈ (0, T2).

kv1kL∞(0,T1;U ).

1

From (3.24), (3.22) and the ﬁrst equality in (3.21), one can easily check that ˆy(T2; y0, v3) =
S(T2 − T1)ˆy(T1; y0, v1) = 0, which implies that v3 is an admissible control to (NP )T2,y0.
This, together with the deﬁnition of N(T2, y0) (see (1.18)) and (3.24), implies that

N(T2, y0) ≤ kv3kL∞(0,T2;U ) ≤ max(cid:8)(1 − λ)kv1kL∞(0,T1;U ), kv2kL∞(0,T2;U )(cid:9).

46

From this, (3.21), (3.23) and (3.20), after some simple computations, we deduce that

N(T2, y0) ≤ maxn(1 − λ)(cid:0)N(T1, y0) + δ(cid:1), C1λT 1/p1

= N(T1, y0) − δ < N(T1, y0).

1

(cid:0)N(T1, y0) + δ(cid:1)o

So N(·, y0) is strictly decreasing over(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1).

Step 2. To show that

N(T, y0) ≤ lim inf
t∈A, t→T

N(T, y0) for all T ∈ A ,(cid:2)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1)
Arbitrarily ﬁx a T0 ∈(cid:2)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1). Then arbitrarily take a sequence:

Tn = T0.

{Tn}∞

n=1 ⊂(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1), with lim

n→∞

To show (3.25), it suﬃces to prove that

N(T0, y0) ≤ lim inf
n→∞

N(Tn, y0).

(3.25)

(3.26)

(3.27)

By contradiction, we suppose that lim inf n→∞ N(Tn, y0) < N(T0, y0). Then there would
be a subsequence {Tnk}∞

k=1 of {Tn}∞

n=1 so that

lim
k→∞

N(Tnk , y0) = lim inf
n→∞

N(Tn, y0) < N(T0, y0).

Thus there is a positive constant C so that

N(Tnk, y0) < C < ∞ for all k ≥ 1.

(3.28)

(3.29)

It is clear that 0 < Tnk < ∞ (see (3.26)) for each k ∈ N+. This, along with (1.18) and
(3.29), yields that for each k ∈ N+, there is a control unk ∈ L∞(0, Tnk; U) so that

ˆy(Tnk ; y0, unk) = 0 and kunkkL∞(0,Tnk ;U ) < N(Tnk , y0) + 1/k.

(3.30)

k=1 and a control v0 ∈ L∞(R+; U) so that

For each k ∈ N+, we leteunk be the zero extension of unk over R+. From (3.30) and (3.29),
it follows that {eunk}∞
k=1 is bounded in L∞(R+; U). Then there is a subsequence {eunkl
of {eunk}∞
eunkl
eunkl

→ v0 weakly star in L∞(R+; U), as l → ∞,

→ v0 weakly in L2(R+; U), as l → ∞.

which implies that

(3.31)

}∞
l=1

47

Because liml→∞ Tnkl

= T0, the above convergence, together with Lemma 3.1, yields that

which, along with the ﬁrst equality in (3.30), implies that

y(Tnkl

; y0,eunkl

) → y(T0; y0, v0) weakly in X, as l → ∞,

y(T0; y0, v0) = 0.

(3.32)

Since y0 ∈ X \ {0} and T0 < T 1(y0), the equality (3.32) indicates that 0 < T0 < ∞.
Therefore, the problem (NP )T0,y0 makes sense. From (3.32), we know that v0|(0,T0) is an
admissible control to (NP )T0,y0. This, along with (1.18), (3.31) and the second inequality
in (3.30), yields that

N(T0, y0) ≤ kv0kL∞(0,T0;U ) ≤ lim inf
l→∞

kL∞(R+;U ) ≤ lim inf
l→∞

N(Tnkl

, y0),

which contradicts (3.28). Thus, (3.27) is true. This ends the proof of (3.25).
Step 3. To show that

keunkl

(3.33)

N(T, y0) ≥ lim sup
t∈B, t→T

N(T, y0) for all T ∈ B ,(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:3)

Arbitrarily ﬁx a T0 ∈ (cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:3). We aim to show that (3.33) holds for T = T0.

There are only two possibilities on T0: either T0 = ∞ or T0 < ∞. In the case that T0 = ∞,
(3.33), with T = T0, follows directly from the ﬁrst equality in (1.21).

The key of this step is to prove that

N(T0, y0) ≥ lim sup

t→T0

N(t, y0), when T0 < ∞.

(3.34)

To this end, we arbitrarily take {Tn}∞
According to Corollary 2.14, there is a sequence {zn}∞

n=1 in(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1) so that limn→∞ Tn = T0 < ∞.

n=1 ⊂ D(A∗) so that for each n ≥ 1,

kB∗S∗(Tn − ·)znkL1(0,Tn;U ) = 1

(3.35)

and

N(Tn, y0) − 1/n ≤ hS(Tn)y0, zniX ≤ N(Tn, y0).

(3.36)

Arbitrarily ﬁx a sequence:

The rest of the proof of this step is divided into three parts as follows:

{tk}∞

k=1 ⊂(cid:0)T 0(y0), T0(cid:1) with tk ր T0.

(3.37)

48

Part 3.1. To prove that there is a subsequence {nl}∞
that for each k ∈ N+,

l=1 in N+ and a function g ∈ BYT0

so

B∗S∗(Tnl − ·)znl → g weakly in L1(0, tk; U), as l → ∞

(3.38)

For each n, we deﬁne a function ψn over (0, T0) in the following manner:

ψn(t) =(cid:26) B∗S∗(Tn − t)zn,

0,

t ∈(cid:0)0, min{Tn, T0}(cid:1),
t ∈(cid:2) min{Tn, T0}, T0(cid:1).

For each k ∈ N+, since tk < T0 (see (3.37)) and limn→∞ Tn = T0, we see that there is
N(k) ∈ N+ so that tk < min{Tn, T0}, when n ≥ N(k). Since zn ∈ D(A∗) for all n, we
have that for each k ∈ N+, S∗(Tn − tk)zn ∈ D(A∗), when n ≥ N(k). Then by (1.22), we
ﬁnd that when k ∈ N+ and n ≥ N(k),

ψn |(0,tk)= B∗S∗(Tn − ·)zn |(0,tk)= B∗S∗(tk − ·)(cid:0)S∗(Tn − tk)zn(cid:1) |(0,tk)∈ Ytk.

This, along with (3.35), yields that for each k ∈ N+, ψn |(0,tk)∈ BYtk
, when n ≥ N(k).
From this, (H1) and Corollary 2.10 (with T = tk), we see that for each k ∈ N+, there is
a function gk ∈ BYtk

and a subsequence {ψkn}∞

n=1 so that

(3.39)

n=1 ⊂ {ψ(k−1)n}∞

and so that

ψkn |(0,tk)→ gk in the topology σ(Ytk, R0

From these and the diagonal law, the subsequence {ψnn}∞
each k ∈ N+,

n=1 of {ψn}∞

n=1 satisﬁes that for

ψnn |(0,tk)→ gk in the topology σ(Ytk , R0

Arbitrarily ﬁx a k ∈ N+ and then arbitrarily take uk ∈ Uk where

Since uk is an admissible control to (NP )ytk , with ytk
2.8 and (3.42) to get that for each k and each uk ∈ Uk,

We next claim that

(3.43)

gj = gj′ over [0, tj] for all j, j′ ∈ N+ with j < j′.

(3.44)

(3.43), indicates that

For this purpose, we arbitrarily ﬁx j, j′ ∈ N+ so that j < j′. Let uj ∈ Uj. Write euj for
the zero extension of uj over (0, tj′). It follows from (3.41) thateuj ∈ Uj′. This, along with
Z tj

Since uj was arbitrarily taken from Uj (see (3.41)), the above leads to (3.44).

Now, deﬁne g(·) : (0, T0) → U by

g(t) , gk(t), t ∈ (0, tk],

for each k ∈ N+.

(3.45)

From (3.44), we see that g is well deﬁned. By (3.43) and (3.45), we ﬁnd that for each
k ∈ N+ and each uk+1 ∈ Uk+1,

Z tk+1

hψnn(t), uk+1(t)iU dt →Z tk+1

(3.46)

Given a vk ∈ L∞(0, tk; U), letevk be the zero extension of vk over (0, tk+1). Thenevk ∈ Uk+1.
Replacing uk+1 byevk in (3.46), we obtain that for each k ∈ N+ and each vk ∈ L∞(0, tk; U),

hg(t), vk(t)iU dt, as n → ∞,

Z tk

0

hψnn(t), vk(t)iU dt →Z tk

from which, it follows that for each k ∈ N+,

ψnn → g weakly in L1(0, tk; U), as n → ∞.

(3.47)

for each k ∈ N+, by (3.45) and (i)
We now prove that g ∈ BYT0
of Lemma 2.6, we deduce that g|(0,s) ∈ Ys for all s ∈ (0, T0) and that kgkL1(0,T0;U ) ≤ 1.

. Indeed, since gk ∈ BYtk

50

From these, as well as (H1) and (ii) of Lemma 2.6, we see that g ∈ BYT0
with (3.47), leads to the conclusion of Part 3.1.
Part 3.2. To show that the subsequence {nl}∞

l=1, obtained in Part 3.1, satisﬁes that

. This, together

hS(Tnl)y0, znliX → hS(T0)y0, giRT0 ,YT0

, as l → ∞

(3.48)

Recall (3.37) for {tk}∞
k=1. Since t1 > T 0(y0), we see from (1.19) that there is an u1 ∈
L∞(R+; U) so that 0 = y(t1; y0, χ(0,t1)u1), from which, it follows from (1.16) that for each
T ≥ t1,

0 = ˆy(T ; y0, χ(0,t1)u1|(0,T )) = S(T )y0 +Z T

0

S−1(T − τ )Bχ(0,t1)(τ )u1(τ ) dτ.

(3.49)

Because liml→∞ Tnl = T0 > t1, there exists an N0 > 0 so that Tnl ≥ t1 for all l ≥ N0.
This, along with (3.49) (with T = Tnl) and (1.15), yields that for each l ≥ N0,

hS(Tnl)y0, znliX = −Z t1

0 (cid:10)χ(0,t1)(τ )u1(τ ), B∗S∗(Tnl − τ )znl(cid:11)U dτ,

which, together with (3.38) (where k = 2), implies that

hS(Tnl)y0, znliX = −Z t1

lim
l→∞

0 (cid:10)χ(0,t1)(τ )u1(τ ), g(τ )(cid:11)U dτ.

Meanwhile, since T0 > t1, it follows by (1.44) and (3.49) (where T = T0) that

S(T0)y0 ∈ RT0.

(3.50)

(3.51)

By (3.49), we know that −χ(0,t1)u1|(0,T0) is an admissible control to (NP )yT0 , with yT0
S(T0)y0. Thus, it follows from (3.51) and (2.3) that

,

hS(T0)y0, giRT0 ,YT0

= −Z t1

0 (cid:10)χ(0,t1)(τ )u1(τ ), g(τ )(cid:11)U dτ.

This, along with (3.50), yields (3.48).

Part 3.3. To show (3.34)

It is clear that T 0(y0) < T0 < ∞. Then by (3.51) and (ii) of Proposition 2.13, we see

that

N(T0, y0) = k − S(T0)y0kRT0

.

(3.52)

51

From (3.51) and (2.3), we ﬁnd that

k − S(T0)y0kRT0

kgkYT0

≥ hS(T0)y0, giRT0 ,YT0

.

This, along with (3.52), implies that

N(T0, y0)kgkYT0

≥ hS(T0)y0, giRT0 ,YT0

.

(3.53)

Since g ∈ BYT0
yields that

(see Part 3.1), we have that kgkYT0

≤ 1. This, as well as (3.53) and (3.48),

N(T0, y0) ≥ N(T0, y0)kgkYT0

≥ lim
l→∞

hS(Tnl)y0, znliX.

(3.54)

From (3.54) and (3.36), we obtain that N(T0, y0) ≥ liml→∞ N(Tnl, y0). Since the function
N(·, y0) is decreasing (see (ii) of Lemma 3.2), the above leads to (3.34) (in the case that
T0 < ∞).

In summary, we conclude that (3.33) holds. This ends the proof of Step 3.

Now, from Lemma 3.2 and the conclusions in Step 2 and Step 3, we see that the

This, along with the conclusion in Step 1, proves the conclusion (i) of Proposition 3.6.

function N(·, y0) is continuous from(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1) onto(cid:0)N(T 1(y0), y0), N(T 0(y0), y0)(cid:1).
(ii) Fix a y0 ∈ X \ {0} so that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0). Let T ∈ (cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1) and

0 ≤ s1 < T < s2 ≤ ∞. Choose two numbers s′

1 and s′

2 so that

1 < T < s′

2 < s2.

(3.55)

1, s′
s′

2 ∈(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1) and s1 < s′

Because N(·, y0) is strictly decreasing over(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1) (see the conclusion (i) in this

proposition), it follows from (3.55) that

N(s′

1, y0) > N(T, y0) > N(s′

2, y0).

(3.56)

Since N(·, y0) is decreasing over [0, ∞] (see (ii) of Lemma 3.2), it follows by (3.55) and
(3.56) that

N(s1, y0) ≥ N(s′

1, y0) > N(T, y0) > N(s′

2, y0) ≥ N(s2, y0),

which leads to (3.18). The conclusion (ii) is proved.

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of Proposition 3.6.

52

Corollary 3.7. Suppose that (H1) holds. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0).
Then the following conclusions are valid:

(i) When M ∈(cid:0)N(T 1(y0), y0), N(T 0(y0), y0)(cid:1),
(ii) When T ∈(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1),

T 0(y0) < T (M, y0) < T 1(y0) and M = N(T (M, y0), y0).

(3.57)

(3.58)

N(T 1(y0), y0) < N(T, y0) < N(T 0(y0), y0) and T = T (N(T, y0), y0).

Proof. (i) Let y0 ∈ X \ {0}, with T 0(y0) < T 1(y0). Then by (H1), we can apply (i) of
Proposition 3.6 to see that N(T 1(y0), y0) < N(T 0(y0), y0). Let

According to (i) of Proposition 3.6, there is ˆT so that

M ∈(cid:0)N(T 1(y0), y0), N(T 0(y0), y0)(cid:1).

T 0(y0) < ˆT < T 1(y0) and M = N( ˆT , y0).

To prove (3.57), it suﬃces to show that

ˆT = T (M, y0).

(3.59)

(3.60)

(3.61)

By contradiction, suppose that (3.61) were not true. Then we would have that either
ˆT < T (M, y0) or ˆT > T (M, y0). In the case that ˆT < T (M, y0), we ﬁrst observe from
(3.60) and (3.59) that N( ˆT , y0) = M < N(T 0(y0), y0) ≤ ∞. Thus, it follows from (1.18)
that for each n ≥ 1, there is a control vn so that

and

kvnkL∞(0, ˆT ;U ) ≤ N( ˆT , y0) + 1/n < ∞

ˆy( ˆT ; y0, vn) = 0.

(3.62)

(3.63)

n=1, still denoted in the same manner,

Write evn for the zero extension of vn over R+, n ∈ N+. From (3.62), we see that on a
subsequence of {evn}∞
It is clear thatevn converges to v0 weakly in L2(R+; U). Then by Lemma 3.1 and (3.63),

evn → v0 weakly star in L∞(R+; U), as n → ∞.

(3.64)

(3.65)

we ﬁnd that

y( ˆT ; y0, v0) = 0.

Meanwhile, from (3.64), (3.62) and (3.60), we have that

kv0kL∞(R+;U ) ≤ lim inf
n→∞

kevnkL∞(R+;U ) ≤ N( ˆT , y0) = M.

53

(3.66)

From (3.65) and (3.66), we see that v0 is an admissible control to (T P )M,y0. Then by
(1.17), we see that ˆT ≥ T (M, y0), which leads to a contradiction, since we are in the case
that ˆT < T (M, y0).

In the case when ˆT > T (M, y0), we have that T (M, y0) < ∞. This, along with (1.17),

yields that for each n ≥ 1, there is a control un ∈ U M and a number Tn so that

T (M, y0) ≤ Tn ≤ T (M, y0) + 1/n < ∞;

kunkL∞(R+;U ) ≤ M and y(Tn; y0, un) = 0.

(3.67)

(3.68)

Since y0 ∈ X \ {0}, these imply that 0 < Tn < ∞ for all n ≥ 1. From this and the second
equality in (3.68), it follows that for each n, un|(0,Tn) is an admissible control to (NP )Tn,y0.
This, along with the ﬁrst inequality in (3.68) and the deﬁnition of N(Tn, y0) (see (1.18)),
yields that for each n, M ≥ kunkL∞(R+;U ) ≥ N(Tn, y0), which, together with the second
equality in (3.60), implies that

N( ˆT , y0) ≥ N(Tn, y0) for each n.

(3.69)

Since (H1) holds and ˆT ∈(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1), we see from (3.18) and (3.69) that for each

n ∈ N+, Tn ≥ ˆT which, together with (3.67), indicates that T (M, y0) ≥ ˆT . This leads to
a contradiction, because we are in the case that ˆT > T (M, y0). Thus, the conclusion (i)
of this corollary is true.

(ii) Let y0 ∈ X \ {0}, with T 0(y0) < T 1(y0). Arbitrarily ﬁx T ∈ (T 0(y0), T 1(y0). Since
(H1) holds, we can use the conclusion (i) of Proposition 3.6 to see the T satisﬁes the ﬁrst
inequality in (3.58). Then by this and (3.57) (where M = N(T, y0)), we ﬁnd that

T 0(y0) < T (N(T, y0), y0) < T 1(y0) and N(T, y0) = N(cid:0)T (N(T, y0), y0), y0(cid:1).

Since N(·, y0) is strictly decreasing over(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1) (see (i) of Proposition 3.6) and
because T ∈(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1), it follows from (3.70) that T satisﬁes the second equality

(3.70)

in (3.58).

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of this corollary.

We can have the following property on T (M, y0), without assuming (H1). (Compare

it with the conclusion (i) of Corollary 3.7.)

Proposition 3.8. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0}. Then T 0(y0) ≤ T (M, y0) ≤ T 1(y0) for each M ∈
(0, ∞).

Proof. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} and M ∈ (0, ∞). We ﬁrst show that

T (M, y0) ≥ T 0(y0).

(3.71)

54

By contradiction, suppose that T (M, y0) < T 0(y0). Then by (1.17), there would be

ˆt ∈(cid:2)T (M, y0), T 0(y0)(cid:1) and u1 ∈ U M so that y(ˆt; y0, u1) = 0. This contradicts the deﬁnition

of T 0(y0) (see (1.19)). So we have proved (3.71).

We next show that

T (M, y0) ≤ T 1(y0).

(3.72)

By contradiction, suppose that T 1(y0) < T (M, y0). Then by (ii) of Lemma 3.3, we would
have that 0 < T 1(y0) < ∞. By this and (1.18), we ﬁnd that the problem (NP )T 1(y0),y0
makes sense. Since T 1(y0) < ∞, it follows from (v) of Lemma 3.3 that N(T 1(y0), y0) = 0.
From this and (1.18), we see that there exists a control v1 to (NP )T 1(y0),y0 so that

ˆy(T 1(y0); y0, v1) = 0 and kv1kL∞(0,T 1(y0);U ) < M.

(3.73)

Letev1 be the zero extension of v1 over R+. Then from (3.73), it follows that
From (3.74), we see that ev1 is an admissible control to (T P )M,y0. Then, from the ﬁrst

equation in (3.74) and (1.17), we see that T (M, y0) ≤ T 1(y0), which leads to a contradic-
tion. Hence, (3.72) is true.

y(T 1(y0); y0,ev1) = 0 and kev1kL∞(R+;U ) < M.

(3.74)

Finally, by (3.71) and (3.72), we end the proof of Proposition 3.8.

4 Existence of minimal time and minimal norm con-

trols

In this section, we present the existence of minimal time and minimal norm controls
for (T P )M,y0 and (NP )T,y0, and the non-existence of admissible controls for (T P )M,y0
and (NP )T,y0 for all possible cases. These properties play import roles in the proofs of
Theorem 1.4 and Theorem 1.5. We also study the existence of minimal norm controls for
aﬃliated minimal norm problems (NP )yT , with yT ∈ RT (given by (1.43) and (1.44)).
Such existence will be used in the studies of a maximum principle for (NP )yT , with
y0 ∈ R0
T (given by (1.45)). The later is the base of the studies of maximum principles,
as well as the bang-bang properties for (T P )M,y0 and (NP )T,y0. The ﬁrst theorem in this
section concerns with the existence of minimal norm controls to the problem (NP )yT .

Theorem 4.1. Let T ∈ (0, ∞). The following conclusions are true:
(i) For each yT ∈ RT , (NP )yT has at least one minimal norm control.
(ii) The null control is the unique minimal norm control to (NP )yT , with yT = 0 in RT .

55

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a T ∈ (0, ∞). We are going to show the conclusions (i)-(ii) one by
one.

(i) Let yT ∈ RT be arbitrarily given. According to the deﬁnitions of the problem
(NP )yT and the subspace RT (see (1.43) and (1.44)), (NP )yT has at least one admissible
control. Thus there is a minimization sequence {vn}∞
n=1 ⊂ L∞(0, T ; U) for (NP )yT so that
(4.1)

ˆy(T ; 0, vn) = yT for all n ∈ N+

and

From (4.2), we ﬁnd that there is a subsequence of {vn}∞
and a control v0 ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) so that

kvnkL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ kyT kRT + 1/n for all n ∈ N+.

(4.2)
n=1, denoted in the same manner,

vn → v0 weakly star in L∞(0, T ; U), as n → ∞.

From (4.3), Lemma 3.1 and (4.1), we see that

This, along with (1.43), (4.3) and (4.2), yields that

ˆy(T ; 0, v0) = yT .

(4.3)

(4.4)

kyT kRT ≤ kv0kL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ lim inf
n→∞

kvnkL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ kyT kRT ,

from which, it follows that

(4.5)
By (4.4) and (4.5), we ﬁnd that v0 is a minimal norm control to (NP )yT . This ends the
proof of the conclusion (i).

kyT kRT = kv0kL∞(0,T ;U ).

(ii) By (1.16), we see that ˆy(T ; 0, 0) = 0. Meanwhile, since k · kRT is a norm (see
(1.43)), we ﬁnd that k0kRT = 0. Therefore, we see that when yT = 0, the null control is a
minimal norm control to (NP )yT and that the minimal norm of (NP )yT is 0. The latter
shows that (NP )yT , with yT = 0, has no non-zero minimal norm control. Thus, the null
control is the unique minimal norm control to (NP )yT , with yT = 0.

In summary, we complete the proof of this theorem.

We now present the following lemma which will be used in the studies on the existence

of minimal norm controls to (NP )T,y0 and minimal time controls to (T P )M,y0.

Lemma 4.2. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0}, T ∈ (0, ∞) and M ∈ (0, ∞). Then the following
conclusions are true:
(i) If (NP )T,y0 has an admissible control, then it has at least one minimal norm control.
(ii) If (T P )M,y0 has an admissible control, then it has at least one minimal time control.
(iii) If N(T, y0) < ∞, then (NP )T,y0 has at least one minimal norm control.
(iv) If N(T, y0) = 0, then the null control is the unique minimal norm control to (NP )T,y0.
(v) If N(T, y0) = ∞, then (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible control.

56

Proof. (i) Suppose that (NP )T,y0 has an admissible control. Then it has a minimization
sequence {vn}∞

n=1 ⊂ L∞(0, T ; U) so that

ˆy(T ; y0, vn) = 0 for all n ∈ N+

and

kvnkL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ N(T, y0) + 1/n for all n ∈ N+.

(4.6)

(4.7)

By (4.7), we see that there is a subsequence of {vn}∞
a control v0 ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) so that

n=1, denoted in the same manner, and

vn → v0 weakly star in L∞(0, T ; U), as n → ∞.

From (4.8), Lemma 3.1 and (4.6), we ﬁnd that

This, together with (1.18), (4.8) and (4.7), yields that

ˆy(T ; y0, v0) = 0.

(4.8)

(4.9)

N(T, y0) ≤ kv0kL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ lim inf
n→∞

kvnkL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ N(T, y0).

Hence, we have that

By (4.9) and (4.10), we ﬁnd that v0 is a minimal norm control to (NP )T,y0.

N(T, y0) = kv0kL∞(0,T ;U ).

(4.10)

(ii) Suppose that (T P )M,y0 has an admissible control. Then there are two sequences
n=1 ⊂ L∞(R+; U) and {Tn}∞

n=1 ⊂ R+ so that

{un}∞

and

y(Tn; y0, un) = 0 for all n ∈ N+,

Tn ց T (M, y0), as n → ∞

kunkL∞(R+;U ) ≤ M for all n ∈ N+.

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

By (4.13), we see that there are a subsequence of {un}∞
manner, and an u0 ∈ L∞(R+; U) so that

n=1, still denoted in the same

un → u0 weakly star in L∞(R+; U), as n → ∞.

(4.14)

From (4.12), (4.14), Lemma 3.1 and (4.11), it follows that

y(cid:0)T (M, y0); y0, u0(cid:1) = 0.

57

(4.15)

Meanwhile, it follows from (4.14) and (4.13) that

ku0kL∞(R+;U ) ≤ lim inf
n→∞

kunkL∞(R+;U ) ≤ M.

(4.16)

By (4.15) and (4.16), we see that u0 is a minimal time control to (T P )M,y0.

(iii) Suppose that N(T, y0) < ∞. Then it follows by (1.18) that (NP )T,y0 has an
admissible control. Thus, by (i) of this lemma, we ﬁnd that (NP )T,y0 has at least one
minimal norm control.

(iv) Suppose that N(T, y0) = 0. On one hand, by the conclusion (iii) in this lemma,
we see that (NP )T,y0 has at least one minimal norm control. On the other hand, if v∗ is
a minimal norm control to (NP )T,y0, then we have that

kv∗kL∞(0,T ;U ) = N(T, y0) = 0,

which yields that v∗ = 0. Hence, the null control is the unique minimal norm control to
(NP )T,y0.
(v) Assume that N(T, y0) = ∞. By contradiction, suppose that (NP )T,y0 had an admis-
sible control v∗ ∈ L∞(0, T ; U). Then, by (1.18), we would have that

∞ = N(T, y0) ≤ kv∗kL∞(0,T ;U ) < ∞.

This leads to a contradiction. Hence, (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible control.

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of this lemma.

The next theorem concerns with the existence of minimal norm controls to the problem

(NP )T,y0, in the case when T 0(y0) < ∞.

Theorem 4.3. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy that T 0(y0) < ∞. Then the following conclusions
are true:
(i) If T 0(y0) < T < ∞, then (NP )T,y0 has at least one minimal norm control.
(ii) If T 0(y0) > 0 and 0 < T < T 0(y0), then (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible control.
(iii) If 0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞, then

T 0(y0) > 0

(4.17)

and (NP )T 0(y0),y0 has at least one minimal norm control.
(iv) If N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0, then (4.17) holds and the null control is the unique minimal
norm control to the problem (NP )T 0(y0),y0.
(v) If N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞ and T 0(y0) > 0, then (NP )T 0(y0),y0 has no any admissible
control.
(vi) If T 0(y0) = 0, then the problem (NP )T 0(y0),y0 does not make sense.

58

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X \ {0} so that

T 0(y0) < ∞.

(4.18)

(i) Suppose that

Then by (1.19) and (4.19), there are a ˆt ∈(cid:0)T 0(y0), T(cid:1) and an ˆu ∈ L∞(0, ˆt; U) so that

ˆy(ˆt; y0, ˆu) = 0.

T 0(y0) < T < ∞.

(4.19)

(4.20)

Extend ˆu over (0, T ) by setting it to be zero over [ˆt, T ). Denote the extension in the same
manner. Then we see from (4.20) that ˆy(T ; y0, ˆu) = 0, from which, it follows that ˆu is an
admissible control to (NP )T,y0. This, along with (i) of Lemma 4.2, yields that (NP )T,y0
has at least one minimal norm control.

(ii) Suppose that

T 0(y0) > 0 and 0 < T < T 0(y0).

(4.21)

Then it follows from (1.19) and (4.21) that (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible control.

(iii) Assume that

0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞.

(4.22)

We ﬁrst show (4.17). By contradiction, suppose that (4.17) were not true. Then we would
have that T 0(y0) = 0. This, along with (iv) in Lemma 3.3, yields that

N(T 0(y0), y0) = N(0, y0) = ∞,

which contradicts (4.22). Hence, we have proved (4.17). Next, it follows from (4.17) and
(4.18) that 0 < T 0(y0) < ∞. This shows that the problem (NP )T 0(y0),y0 makes sense.
(Notice that in the deﬁnition of (NP )T,y0, it is required that 0 < T < ∞, see (1.18).)
Finally, by (4.22), we can apply (iii) of Lemma 4.2 to ﬁnd that (NP )T 0(y0),y0 has at least
one minimal norm control.

(iv) Suppose that

N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0.

(4.23)

We ﬁrst show that (4.17) stands in this case. By contradiction, suppose that (4.17) were
not true. Then we would have that T 0(y0) = 0. This, together with (iv) in Lemma 3.3,
indicates that

N(T 0(y0), y0) = N(0, y0) = ∞,

which contradicts (4.23). So (4.17) in this case. Next, by (4.17) and (4.18), we see that
0 < T 0(y0) < ∞. Hence, the problem (NP )T 0(y0),y0 makes sense. Finally, by (4.23), we
can apply (iv) of Lemma 4.2 to ﬁnd that the null control is the unique minimal norm
control to (NP )T 0(y0),y0.

59

(v) Suppose that

N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞ and T 0(y0) > 0.

(4.24)

Then it follows from the second inequality in (4.24) and (4.18) that 0 < T 0(y0) < ∞.
Hence, the problem (NP )T 0(y0),y0 makes sense. Finally, by the ﬁrst equality in (4.24), we
can apply (v) of Lemma 4.2 to ﬁnd that (NP )T 0(y0),y0 has no any admissible control.

(vi) Suppose that T 0(y0) = 0. Then the problem (NP )T 0(y0),y0 does not make sense,

since in the deﬁnition of (NP )T,y0, it is required that T ∈ (0, ∞) (see (1.18)).

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 4.3.

The following theorem concerns with the existence of minimal time controls to (T P )M,y0

and minimal norm controls to (NP )T,y0, in the case that T 0(y0) = ∞.

Theorem 4.4. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy that T 0(y0) = ∞. Then the following conclusions
are true:
(i) For each M ∈ (0, ∞), (T P )M,y0 does not have any admissible control.
(ii) For each T ∈ (0, ∞), (NP )T,y0 does not have any admissible control.

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X \ {0} so that T 0(y0) = ∞. First of all, since T 0(y0) = ∞,
it follows from (1.19) that for each T ∈ (0, ∞),

ˆy(T ; y0, u) 6= 0 for all u ∈ L∞(0, T ; U).

(4.25)

We next show the conclusions (i)-(ii) one by one.

(i) By contradiction, suppose that for some ˆM ∈ (0, ∞), (T P ) ˆM,y0 had an admissible
control ˆu. Then we would have that y(ˆt; y0, ˆu) = 0 for some ˆt ∈ (0, ∞), which contradicts
(4.25). So for each M ∈ (0, ∞), (T P )M,y0 has no any admissible control.

(ii) By contradiction, we suppose that for some ˆT ∈ (0, ∞), (NP ) ˆT ,y0 had an admissible
control ˆv. Then we would have that ˆy( ˆT ; y0, ˆv) = 0, which contradicts (4.25). So for each
T ∈ (0, ∞), (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible control.

Thus we complete the proof of this theorem.

The following theorem concerns with the existence of minimal time controls to (T P )M,y0,

in the case when T 0(y0) < ∞.

Theorem 4.5. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy that T 0(y0) < ∞. Then it holds that

N(T 1(y0), y0) < ∞.

(4.26)

Furthermore, the following conclusions are true:
(i) If N(T 1(y0), y0) < M < ∞, then (T P )M,y0 has at least one minimal time control.

60

(ii) If N(T 1(y0), y0) > 0 and 0 < M < N(T 1(y0), y0), then (T P )M,y0 has no any admissible
control.
(iii) Suppose that (H1) holds. If M0 , N(T 1(y0), y0) > 0, then (T P )M0,y0 has no any
admissible control.

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X \ {0} so that T 0(y0) < ∞. Then (4.26) follows from (v)
of Lemma 3.4. Next, we are going to show conclusions (i)-(iii) one by one.

(i) Let M ∈ (N(T 1(y0), y0), ∞). Then by (vi) of Lemma 3.3, we see that

∞ > M > N(T 1(y0), y0) = N(∞, y0).

(4.27)

Since T 0(y0) < ∞, it follows from (4.27) and the ﬁrst equality in (1.21) that there is a
number T1 so that

T 0(y0) < T1 < ∞ and N(T1, y0) < M < ∞.

(4.28)

By the ﬁrst conclusion in (4.28), we can apply (i) of Theorem 4.3 to ﬁnd that (NP )T1,y0
has a minimal norm control v∗. Hence we have that

ˆy(T1; y0, v∗) = 0 and kv∗kL∞(0,T1;U ) = N(T1, y0).

(4.29)

Writeev∗ for the zero extension of v∗ over R+. Then it follows from (4.29) and (4.28) that
These imply thatev∗ is an admissible control to (T P )M,y0. Then by (ii) of Lemma 4.2, we

y(T1; y0,ev∗) = 0 and kev∗kL∞(R+;U ) = N(T1, y0) < M < ∞.

ﬁnd that (T P )M,y0 has at least one minimal time control.

(ii) Assume that

N(T 1(y0), y0) > 0 and 0 < M < N(T 1(y0), y0).

(4.30)

We aim to show that (T P )M,y0 has no any admissible control. By contradiction, suppose
that (T P )M,y0 had an admissible control. Then according to (ii) of Lemma 4.2, (T P )M,y0
would have a minimal time control u∗

1. Hence, it holds that

T (M, y0) < ∞, ku∗

1kL∞(R+;U ) ≤ M and y(T (M, y0); y0, u∗

1) = 0.

Since y0 ∈ X \ {0}, from the third and the ﬁrst conclusions in (4.31), we see that

0 < T (M, y0) < ∞.

(4.31)

(4.32)

Write ˆu∗

1 for the restriction of u∗

1 over(cid:0)0, T (M, y0)(cid:1). Then it follows from (4.31) that

1kL∞(0,T (M,y0);U ) ≤ M

kˆu∗

(4.33)

61

and

ˆy(T (M, y0); y0, ˆu∗

1) = 0.

(4.34)

By (4.32), the problem (NP )T (M,y0),y0 makes sense (see (1.18)). Then by (4.34), we ﬁnd
that ˆu∗
1 is an admissible control to (NP )T (M,y0),y0. This, along with the deﬁnition of
N(T (M, y0), y0) (see (1.18)) and (4.33), yields that

N(T (M, y0), y0) ≤ kˆu∗

1kL∞(0,T (M,y0);U ) ≤ M,

which, together with the second inequality in (4.30), indicates that

N(T (M, y0), y0) < N(T 1(y0), y0).

From (4.35), (ii) of Lemma 3.2 and the ﬁrst inequality in (4.31), it follows that

T 1(y0) < T (M, y0) < ∞.

(4.35)

(4.36)

By (4.36), we can apply (v) of Lemma 3.3 to get that N(T 1(y0), y0) = 0, which contradicts
the ﬁrst inequality in (4.30). Hence, (T P )M,y0 has no any admissible control in this case.

(iii) Suppose that (H1) holds. And assume that

M0 , N(T 1(y0), y0) > 0.

(4.37)

Then by (4.37) and (4.26), it follows that 0 < M0 < ∞. Hence, the problem (T P )M0,y0
makes sense. (It is required that 0 < M0 < ∞ in the deﬁnition of (T P )M0,y0, see (1.17).)
We aim to show that (T P )M0,y0 has no any admissible control. By contradiction,
suppose that it had an admissible control. Then we could apply (ii) of Lemma 4.2 to get
a minimal time control u∗

2 for (T P )M0,y0. Hence, we have that

T (M0, y0) < ∞, ku∗

2kL∞(R+;U ) ≤ M0 and y(T (M0, y0); y0, u∗

2) = 0.

Since y0 ∈ X \ {0}, from the third and the ﬁrst assertions in (4.38), we see that

0 < T (M0, y0) < ∞.

(4.38)

(4.39)

Write ˆu∗

2 for the restriction of u∗

2 over(cid:0)0, T (M0, y0)(cid:1). Then it follows from (4.38) that

2kL∞(0,T (M0,y0);U ) ≤ M0

kˆu∗

(4.40)

and

ˆy(T (M0, y0); y0, ˆu∗

2) = 0.

(4.41)

62

By (4.39), the problem (NP )T (M0,y0),y0 makes sense. Then from (4.41), we ﬁnd that ˆu∗
2 is an
admissible control to (NP )T (M0,y0),y0. This, along with the deﬁnition of N(T (M0, y0), y0)
(see (1.18)), (4.40) and (4.37), yields that

N(T (M0, y0), y0) ≤ kˆu∗

2kL∞(0,T (M0,y0);U ) ≤ M0 = N(T 1(y0), y0).

(4.42)

By (4.42) and (vi) of Lemma 3.3, we ﬁnd that

N(T (M0, y0), y0) ≤ N(T 1(y0), y0) = N(∞, y0).

(4.43)

Next, we will use (4.43) to prove that T 1(y0) < ∞. When this is proved, we can
apply (v) of Lemma 3.3 to get that N(T 1(y0), y0) = 0, which contradicts (4.37). Hence,
(T P )M0,y0 has no any admissible control in this case.

The remainder is to show that T 1(y0) < ∞. By contradiction, suppose that it were not
true. Then we would have that T 1(y0) = ∞. Since we are in the case that T 0(y0) < ∞,
it holds that

T 0(y0) < ∞ = T 1(y0).

(4.44)

By the ﬁrst inequality in (4.38) and (4.44), we can ﬁnd a number bT so that
is strictly decreasing over (cid:0)T 0(y0), ∞(cid:1). This, together with (4.45) and the ﬁrst equality

max{T 0(y0), T (M0, y0)} < bT < ∞.

Meanwhile, by (H1) and (4.44), we can apply (i) of Proposition 3.6 to ﬁnd that N(·, y0)

in (1.21), yields that

(4.45)

(4.46)

N(bT , y0) > N(∞, y0).

Since N(·, y0) is decreasing over [0, ∞] (see (ii) of Lemma 3.2), we ﬁnd from the ﬁrst
inequality in (4.45) and (4.46) that

This contradicts (4.43). Hence, we have proved that T 1(y0) < ∞. This ends the proof of
the conclusion (iii) of this theorem.

N(T (M0, y0), y0) ≥ N(bT , y0) > N(∞, y0).

In summary, we complete the proof of this theorem.

Theorem 4.3, Theorem 4.4 and Theorem 4.5 contain results on the existence of minimal
time controls and minimal norm controls and the non-existence of admissible controls of
(T P )M,y0 and (NP )T,y0 for all possible cases. In order to use them in the proof of our
BBP decomposition theorems better, we need several corollaries as follows:

63

Corollary 4.6. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0). Then the following
conclusions are true:
(i) If T 0(y0) > 0 and 0 < T < T 0(y0), then (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible control.
(ii) If T 1(y0) < ∞ and T 1(y0) ≤ T < ∞, then the null control is the unique minimal
norm control to (NP )T,y0.

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X \ {0} so that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0). Then, we have that

T 0(y0) < ∞ and T 1(y0) > 0.

We will prove the conclusions (i)-(ii) one by one.

(i) Suppose that

T 0(y0) > 0 and 0 < T < T 0(y0).

(4.47)

(4.48)

Then we see that T ∈ (0, ∞). Thus, the problem (NP )T,y0 makes sense. Furthermore,
since T 0(y0) < ∞ (see (4.47)), by (4.48), we can apply (ii) of Theorem 4.3 to ﬁnd that
(NP )T,y0 has no any admissible control.

(ii) Suppose that

T 1(y0) < ∞ and T 1(y0) ≤ T < ∞.

By (4.49) and (v) of Lemma 3.3, we ﬁnd that

N(T, y0) = 0.

(4.49)

(4.50)

Meanwhile, from (4.49) and the second inequality in (4.47), it follows that T ∈ (0, ∞).
Hence, we ﬁnd from (iv) of Lemma 4.2 and (4.50) that the null control is the unique
minimal norm control to (NP )T,y0.

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of this corollary.

Corollary 4.7. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy that T 0(y0) = T 1(y0). Then it holds that
T 0(y0) > 0. Furthermore, the following conclusions are true:
(i) If 0 < T < T 0(y0), then (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible control.
(ii) If T 0(y0) < ∞ and T 0(y0) ≤ T < ∞, then the null control is the unique minimal
norm control to (NP )T,y0.

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X \ {0} so that T 0(y0) = T 1(y0). Then by (ii) of Lemma 3.3,
we have that

T 0(y0) > 0.

(4.51)

Next, we will show the conclusions (i)-(ii) one by one.

64

(i) Suppose that

0 < T < T 0(y0).

(4.52)

In the case that T 0(y0) < ∞, by (4.51) and (4.52), we can apply (ii) of Theorem 4.3
to ﬁnd that (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible control in this situation. In the case that
T 0(y0) = ∞, we can apply (ii) of Theorem 4.4 to ﬁnd that (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible
control in this situation. Hence, (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible control.

(ii) Suppose that

T 0(y0) < ∞ and T 0(y0) ≤ T < ∞.

(4.53)

Since we are in the case that T 0(y0) = T 1(y0), it follows from (4.53) that T 1(y0) ≤ T < ∞.
Then by (v) of Lemma 3.3, we ﬁnd that

N(T, y0) = 0.

(4.54)

Meanwhile, it follows from (4.51) and (4.53) that 0 < T < ∞. By this and (4.54), we can
apply (iv) of Lemma 4.2 to see that the null control is the unique minimal norm control
to (NP )T,y0.

In summary, we end the proof of this corollary.

Corollary 4.8. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy that

T 0(y0) < T 1(y0) and N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞.

Then it holds that

0 < N(T 0(y0), y0).

Furthermore, the following conclusions are true:
(i) It holds that

(4.55)

(4.56)

(4.57)

T (M, y0) = T 0(y0) ∈ (0, ∞) for each M ∈(cid:2)N(T 0(y0), y0), ∞(cid:1).

u∗|(0,T 0(y0)) (the restriction of u∗ over (0, T 0(y0))) is a minimal norm control to (NP )T 0(y0),y0.

(ii) For each M ∈ (cid:2)N(T 0(y0), y0), ∞(cid:1), (T P )M,y0 has a minimal time control u∗ so that
(iii) For each M ∈(cid:2)N(T 0(y0), y0), ∞(cid:1), the null control is not a minimal time control to

(T P )M,y0.

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfying (4.55). We ﬁrst prove (4.56). By contra-
diction, suppose that it were not true. Then we would have that N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0. By
this and (iv) of Lemma 3.4, we ﬁnd that T 0(y0) = T 1(y0) < ∞, which contradicts the
ﬁrst inequality in (4.55). So (4.56) stands.

65

Next, we are going to show conclusions (i)-(iii) one by one.
(i) We ﬁrst show that

0 < T 0(y0) < ∞.

(4.58)

Indeed, by the ﬁrst inequality in (4.55), we see that T 0(y0) < ∞. Then by the second
inequality in (4.55) and by (iii) and (iv) of Theorem 4.3, we ﬁnd that T 0(y0) > 0. Hence,
(4.58) stands.

We next show (4.57). From (4.58), we see that the problem (NP )T 0(y0),y0 makes sense.
Since T 0(y0) < ∞ (see (4.58)), by the second inequality in (4.55), we can apply (iii) and
(iv) of Theorem 4.3 to ﬁnd that (NP )T 0(y0),y0 has a minimal norm control v∗. From this,
we have that

ˆy(T 0(y0); y0, v∗) = 0 and kv∗kL∞(0,T 0(y0);U ) = N(T 0(y0), y0).

(4.59)

Write ˆv∗ for the zero extension of v∗ over R+. Then by (4.59), it follows that

and

y(T 0(y0); y0, ˆv∗) = 0

kˆv∗kL∞(R+;U ) = N(T 0(y0), y0) ≤ M for each M ∈(cid:2)N(T 0(y0), y0), ∞(cid:1).

(4.60)

(4.61)

Arbitrarily ﬁx M ∈ (cid:2)N(T 0(y0), y0), ∞(cid:1).

It follows from (4.56) that 0 < M < ∞. So
the problem (T P )M,y0 makes sense.
(In the deﬁnition of (T P )M,y0, it is required that
M ∈ (0, ∞), see (1.17).) Since 0 < T 0(y0) < ∞ (see (4.58)), from (4.60) and (4.61), it
follows that ˆv∗ is an admissible control to (T P )M,y0. This, along with (1.17) and (4.60),
indicates that

T (M, y0) ≤ T 0(y0).

Meanwhile, since M ∈(cid:2)N(T 0(y0), y0), ∞(cid:1), it follows from Proposition 3.8 that

T (M, y0) ≥ T 0(y0).

(4.62)

(4.63)

By (4.62) and (4.63), we see that T (M, y0) = T 0(y0). This, along with (4.58), leads to
(4.57).

(ii) Arbitrarily ﬁx an M ∈(cid:2)N(T 0(y0), y0), ∞(cid:1). Let v∗ and ˆv∗ be given in the proof of

the conclusion (i) of this corollary (see (4.59) and (4.60), respectively). Write u∗ , ˆv∗. It
is clear that

u∗|(0,T 0(y0)) = v∗.

(4.64)

66

Then by (4.57), (4.60) and (4.61), we see that

y(T (M, y0); y0, u∗) = 0 and ku∗kL∞(R+;U ) ≤ M.

control to (NP )T 0(y0),y0.

These yield that u∗ is a minimal time control to (T P )M,y0. Meanwhile, it follows by (4.59)
and (4.64) that u∗|(0,T 0(y0)) is a minimal norm control to (NP )T 0(y0),y0. Hence, in this case,

(T P )M,y0 has a minimal time control whose restriction over(cid:0)0, T 0(y0)(cid:1) is a minimal norm
(T P )M0,y0 for some M0 ∈(cid:2)N(T 0(y0), y0), ∞(cid:1). Then by (4.57), we would have that

(iii) By contradiction, suppose that the null control were a minimal time control to

S(cid:0)T 0(y0)(cid:1)y0 = y(T 0(y0); y0, 0) = y(T (M0, y0); y0, 0) = 0.

This, along with (1.20), implies that T 1(y0) ≤ T 0(y0), which contradicts the ﬁrst equality
in (4.55). Hence, the conclusion (iii) is true.

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of this corollary.

Corollary 4.9. Suppose that (H1) holds. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy that

T 0(y0) < T 1(y0) and N(T 1(y0), y0) > 0.

Then the following conclusions are true:
(i) It holds that

N(T 1(y0), y0) < ∞.

(4.65)

(4.66)

(ii) For each M ∈(cid:0)0, N(T 1(y0), y0)(cid:3), (T P )M,y0 has no any admissible control.

Proof. Suppose that (H1) holds. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy (4.65). We will show the
conclusions (i)-(ii) one by one.

(i) We observe from the ﬁrst inequality in (4.65) that T 0(y0) < ∞. Then (4.66) follows

from (4.26).

(ii) Arbitrarily ﬁx an M so that

0 < M ≤ N(T 1(y0), y0).

(4.67)

By (4.66) and (4.67), we see that M ∈ (0, ∞). Thus the problem (T P )M,y0 makes sense.
Then, by (H1) and (4.67), we can apply (ii) and (iii) of Theorem 4.5 to ﬁnd that (T P )M,y0
has no any admissible control.

Thus, we ﬁnish the proof of this corollary.

67

Corollary 4.10. Suppose that

T 0(y0) = T 1(y0) = ∞.

(4.68)

Then for each M ∈ (0, ∞), (T P )M,y0 does not have any admissible control.

Proof. Suppose that (4.68) holds. Then we can apply (i) of Theorem 4.4 to ﬁnd that
for each M ∈ (0, ∞), (T P )M,y0 has no admissible control. This ends the proof this
corollary.

Corollary 4.11. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy that

T 0(y0) = T 1(y0) < ∞.

(4.69)

Then the following conclusions are true:
(i) It holds that

T (M, y0) = T 0(y0) ∈ (0, ∞) for all M ∈ (0, ∞).

(4.70)

(ii) For each M ∈ (0, ∞), the null control is a minimal time control to (T P )M,y0.

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X \ {0} so that (4.69) holds. We now show the conclusions
(i)-(ii) one by one.

(i) By (ii) of Lemma 3.3 and the ﬁrst inequality in (4.69), we have that T 0(y0) =

T 1(y0) > 0. This, together with the second inequality in (4.69), yields that

0 < T 0(y0) < ∞.

(4.71)

Meanwhile, by Proposition 3.8 , we ﬁnd that

T 0(y0) ≤ T (M, y0) ≤ T 1(y0) for all M ∈ (0, ∞).

From the above and the ﬁrst equality in (4.69), we ﬁnd that T (M, y0) = T 0(y0) for all
M ∈ (0, ∞), which, along with (4.71), leads to (4.70).

(ii) Because of (4.69), we can apply (iv) of Lemma 3.4 to get that N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0.
Since T 0(y0) < ∞ (see (4.69)), the above, along with (iv) of Theorem 4.3, implies that
the null control is the unique minimal norm control to (NP )T 0(y0),y0. Thus, we have that
y(T 0(y0); y0, 0) = 0, which, together with (4.70), shows that y(T (M, y0); y0, 0) = 0 for all
M ∈ (0, ∞). Form this, we see that the null control is a minimal time control to each
(T P )M,y0 with M ∈ (0, ∞).

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of this corollary.

5 Maximum principles and bang-bang properties

In this section, we derive maximum principles for (NP )T,y0, with (T, y0) ∈ W2,3 ∪ W3,2,
and (T P )M,y0, with (M, y0) ∈ V2,2 ∪ V3,2, under the assumption (H1). Here, W2,3, W3,2,
V2,2 and V3,2 are given by (1.30), (1.32), (1.35) and (1.37), respectively. Then we prove
the bang-bang properties for these problems under assumptions (H1) and (H2). The key
to obtain the above-mentioned results is a maximum principle for aﬃliated minimal norm
problem (NP )yT , with yT ∈ R0
T . Recall (1.43) for the deﬁnitions of (NP )yT and kyT kRT ;
(1.44) for the deﬁnition of RT ; (1.45) for the deﬁnition of R0
T ; (1.19) for the deﬁnition of
T 0(y0); (1.20) for the deﬁnition of T 1(y0); and (1.21) for the deﬁnitions of N(0, y0) and
N(∞, y0).

5.1 Maximum principle for aﬃliated problem

This subsection presents a maximum principle of (NP )yT , with yT ∈ R0

respectively BRT(cid:0)0, kyT kRT(cid:1) and BR0

T(cid:0)0, kyT kRT(cid:1) for the closed balls in RT and R0

T \ {0}. Write
T , cen-
tered at the origin and of radius kyT kRT . The way to build up the maximum principle
of (NP )yT , with yT ∈ R0
T \ {0}, is as follows: First, with the aid of Theorem 2.8, we use
(0, kyT kRT ) in the space
the Hahn-Banach separation theorem to separate yT from BR0
T by a hyperplane with a normal vector f ∗ ∈ YT . Then, with the help of Theorem 2.3,
R0
Theorem 2.8, and Proposition 2.15, we prove that the above-mentioned f ∗ also sepa-
rates yT from BRT (0, kyT kRT ) in the space RT . Finally, we apply Theorem 2.3 to the
aforementioned separation in RT to get the maximum principle for (NP )yT .

T

Theorem 5.1. Suppose that (H1) holds. Let T ∈ (0, ∞). Then for each yT ∈ R0
there is an f ∗ ∈ YT \ {0} so that each minimal norm control v∗ to (NP )yT veriﬁes that

T \ {0},

hv∗(t), f ∗(t)iU =

max

kwkU ≤kyT kRT

hw, f ∗(t)iU for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).

(5.1)

Proof. First of all, we notice that R0
Arbitrarily ﬁx a T ∈ (0, ∞) and then ﬁx a yT ∈ R0
several steps.
Step 1. To ﬁnd a vector f ∗ ∈ YT \ {0} separating yT from B0
sense that

T \ {0} 6= ∅ for all T ∈ (0, ∞) (see Lemma 2.11).
T \ {0}. We organize the proof by

T

= hf ∗, yT iYT ,R0

T

(5.2)

Since yT 6= 0 in R0

T , BR0

T

(0, kyT kRT ) is a non-degenerating closed ball in R0

we can apply the Hahn-Banach separation theorem in the space R0

T . Thus,
T to ﬁnd a vector

T

≤ hη0, yT i(R0

T )∗,R0

T

for each zT ∈ BR0

T

(0, kyT kRT ).

Since yT ∈ BR0

T

(0, kyT kRT ), the above yields that

(0,kyT kRT )

zT ∈BR0
T

T )∗,R0

T

= hη0, yT i(R0

T )∗,R0

(5.3)

Meanwhile, because (H1) holds, we can apply Theorem 2.8 to ﬁnd a vector f ∗ ∈ YT so
that

hf ∗, zT iYT ,R0

T

= hη0, zT i(R0

T )∗,R0

T

for all zT ∈ R0

T ; and kf ∗kYT = kη0k(R0

T )∗.

(5.4)

Now, (5.2) follows from (5.3) and (5.4). Besides, since η0 6= 0 in (R0
the second equality in (5.4) that f ∗ 6= 0 in YT .
Step 2. To show that f ∗ given in Step 1 also separates yT from BRT (0, kyT kRT ) in RT in
the sense that

T )∗, it follows from

We ﬁrst claim that

sup

zT ∈BRT (0,kyT kRT )

hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT = hyT , f ∗iRT ,YT

hf ∗, zT iYT ,R0

T

= hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT for all zT ∈ R0
T .

(5.5)

(5.6)

In fact, for each zT ∈ R0
T , it follows from (i) of Theorem 4.1 that (NP )zT has a minimal
norm control vzT . Then by Theorem 2.3 and Theorem 2.8 (more precisely, by (2.3) and
(2.38)), we have that

hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT =Z T

0

These lead to (5.6).

We next claim that

hvzT (t), f ∗(t)iU dt and hf ∗, zT iYT ,R0

T

=Z T

0

hf ∗(t), vzT (t)iU dt.

(0,kyT kRT )

zT ∈BR0

T

hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT =

sup

hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT .

zT ∈BRT (0,kyT kRT )

(5.7)

Indeed, on one hand, since

we have that

BR0

T

(0, kyT kRT ) ⊆ BRT (0, kyT kRT ),

sup
(0,kyT kRT )

zT ∈BR0
T

hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT ≤

sup

zT ∈BRT (0,kyT kRT )

hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT .

(5.8)

70

On the other hand, it follows from Proposition 2.15 that for each zT ∈ BRT (0, kyT kRT ),
there is a sequence {zT,n}∞

(0, kyT kRT ) so that

n=1 in BR0

T

zT,n → zT in σ(RT , YT ), as n → ∞,

which yields that

hzT,n, f ∗iRT ,YT → hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT , as n → ∞.

From this, one can easily check that

sup
(0,kyT kRT )

zT ∈BR0
T

hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT ≥

sup

zT ∈BRT (0,kyT kRT )

hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT .

(5.9)

By (5.8) and (5.9), (5.7) follows at once.

Finally, (5.5) follows from (5.2), (5.6) and (5.7) at once.

Step 3. To derive from (5.5) that

kvkL∞ (0,T ;U )≤kyT kRTZ T

sup

0

hv(t), f ∗(t)iU dt =Z T

0

hv∗(t), f ∗(t)iU dt,

(5.10)

for any minimal norm control v∗ to (NP )yT

First, according to Theorem 2.3 (more precisely, see (2.3)), any minimal norm control

v∗ to (NP )yT (the existence of v∗ is guaranteed by Theorem 4.1) satisﬁes that

hyT , f ∗iRT ,YT =Z T

0

hv∗(t), f ∗(t)iU dt.

We next claim that

kvkL∞ (0,T ;U )≤kyT kRTZ T

sup

0

hv(t), f ∗(t)iU dt =

sup

hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT .

zT ∈BRT (0,kyT kRT )

(5.11)

(5.12)

In fact, on one hand, arbitrarily ﬁx a v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) so that kvkL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ kyT kRT .
Then we ﬁnd from (1.43) that

kˆy(T ; 0, v)kRT ≤ kvkL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ kyT kRT .

(5.13)

Meanwhile, since the above-mentioned v is an admissible control to the problem (NP )zT ,
with zT , ˆy(T ; 0, v), we see from Theorem 2.3 (more precisely, from (2.3)) that

Z T

0

hv(t), f ∗(t)iU dt = hˆy(T ; 0, v), f ∗iRT ,YT .

(5.14)

71

hv(t), f ∗(t)iU dt = hˆy(T ; 0, v), f ∗iRT ,YT ≤

sup

zT ∈BRT (0,kyT kRT )

hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT ,

From (5.14) and (5.13), it follows that

which leads to that

0

Z T
kvkL∞ (0,T ;U )≤kyT kRTZ T

sup

0

hv(t), f ∗(t)iU dt ≤

sup

hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT .

zT ∈BRT (0,kyT kRT )

(5.15)

On the other hand, arbitrarily ﬁx a zT ∈ BRT (0, kyT kRT ). According to Theorem 4.1,
(NP )zT has a minimal norm control v∗

zT satisfying that

zT = ˆy(T ; 0, v∗

zT ) and kv∗

zT kL∞(0,T ;U ) = kzT kRT ≤ kyT kRT .

Then, by (2.3), we ﬁnd that

hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT =Z T

0

From this, we see that

hvzT (t), f ∗(t)iU dt ≤

kvkL∞ (0,T ;U )≤kyT kRTZ T

sup

0

hv(t), f ∗(t)iU dt.

sup

zT ∈BRT (0,kyT kRT )

hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT ≤

kvkL∞ (0,T ;U )≤kyT kRTZ T

sup

0

hv(t), f ∗(t)iU dt.

(5.16)

By (5.15) and (5.16), we obtain (5.12).

Finally, (5.10) follows from (5.5), (5.11) and (5.12) at once.

Step 4. To get (5.1) by dropping the integral in (5.10)

Arbitrarily ﬁx a minimal norm control v∗ to (NP )yT . Since f ∗ ∈ L1(0, T ; U) and

yT 6= 0 in RT , we have that

kf ∗kL1(0,T ;U ) =

sup

kvkL∞ (0,T ;U )≤kyT kRT

hf ∗, viL1(0,T ;U ),L∞(0,T ;U )

kyT kRT

,

which, together with (5.10), yields that

Z T

0

kyT kRT kf ∗(t)kU dt =Z T

0

hv∗(t), f ∗(t)iU dt.

(5.17)

Meanwhile, since v∗ is a minimal norm control to (NP )yT , kv∗kL∞(0,T ;U ) = kyT kRT . This
yields that kv∗(t)kU ≤ kyT kRT for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ). Hence, we have that

hv∗(t), f ∗(t)iU ≤ kyT kRT kf ∗(t)kU for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).

(5.18)

72

From (5.18) and (5.17), we ﬁnd that

hv∗(t), f ∗(t)iU = kyT kRT kf ∗(t)kU for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).

(5.19)

Meanwhile, we have that

kyT kRT kf ∗(t)kU =

max

kwkU ≤kyT kRT

hw, f ∗(t)iU for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).

(5.20)

From (5.19) and (5.20), we are led to (5.1).

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of this theorem.

Remark 5.2. (i) We would like to mention that (5.1) is not a standard Pontryagin
maximum principle, since we are not sure if f ∗ can be expressed as B∗ϕ with ϕ a solution
of the adjoint equation over (0, T ), even in the case that B ∈ L(U, X).
(ii) It is natural to ask if we can directly apply the Hahn-Banach separation theorem to
separate {yT } from BRT (0, kyT kRT ) in the state space X? By our understanding, the
answer seems to be negative in general. However, if we have that

BRT(cid:0)0, kyT kRT(cid:1)o 6= ∅,

where BRT(cid:0)0, kyT kRT(cid:1)o is the interior of the set BRT(cid:0)0, kyT kRT(cid:1) in the space:

k·kX , with the norm k · kX,

(5.21)

(5.22)

eX , span RT

then the answer to the above question is positive.

Indeed, we ﬁrst notice that eX is a
closed subspace of X. Next, since {yT } lies at the boundary of BRT(cid:0)0, kyT kRT(cid:1), by the
assumption (5.21), we can apply the Hahn-Banach separation theorem in the space eX to
separate {yT } from BRT(cid:0)0, kyT kRT(cid:1) via a normal vector η∗ ∈ X \ {0}, i.e.,

hzT , η∗iX ≤ hyT , η∗iX for all zT ∈ BRT(cid:0)0, kyT kRT(cid:1).

Meanwhile, from the ﬁrst assertion in (2.6), (2.3) and (1.25), one can easily check that

hzT , ηiX = hzT , ]B∗S∗(T − ·)ηiRT ,YT for all zT ∈ RT and η ∈ X.

This, along with (5.22), yields that

sup

zT ∈BRT (0,kyT kRT )

hzT , f ∗iRT ,YT = hyT , f ∗iRT ,YT ,

73

where f ∗(·) , ]B∗S∗(T −·)η∗. Then by the similar arguments as those used in (5.5)-(5.20),
we can obtain the standard Pontryagin maximum principle.

Unfortunately, the condition (5.21) does not hold in general.

In fact, consider the

that this map is surjective. By the open mapping theorem, we ﬁnd that iRT is isomorphic

inclusion map iRT : (RT , k · kRT ) ֒→ eX(⊂ X). If (5.21) holds, then one can easily show
from (RT , k · kRT ) to (eX, k · kX ). Hence, RT (= eX) is closed in X and norms k · kRT and

k · kX are equivalent. However, these fail for general controlled system (A, B), such as
the internally controlled heat equations. (It is well known that the reachable subspace at
time T for the internally controlled heat equations over Ω × (0, T ) is not closed in L2(Ω),
where Ω ⊂ Rn is an open bounded domain of C 2.)

5.2 Maximum principles for minimal norm and time controls

We ﬁrst present a maximum principle for (NP )T,y0, with (T, y0) ∈ W2,3 ∪ W3,2 in next
Theorem 5.3. We would like to mention two facts as follows: First, it is not obvious, at
the ﬁrst sight, that the region of pairs (T, y0) described in Theorem 5.3, is the same as
W2,3 ∪ W3,2. However, from (ii) of Remark 3.5, we know that they are the same. Second,
the proof of Theorem 5.3 is based on Theorem 5.1 and the connection between (NP )yT
and (NP )T,y0 built up in Proposition 2.13.

Theorem 5.3. Suppose that (H1) holds. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0).

Then for each T ∈(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1), there is an f ∗ ∈ YT \ {0} so that every minimal norm

control v∗ to (NP )T,y0 satisﬁes that

hv∗(t), f ∗(t)iU =

max

hw, f ∗(t)iU for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).

kwkU ≤N (T,y0)

(5.23)

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X \ {0} so that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0), and then ﬁx a T ∈

ˆyT , −S(T )y0.

(5.24)

(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1). Write

First, we claim that

ˆyT ∈ R0

T \ {0}.

(5.25)

In fact, since T > T 0(y0), it follows from (1.19) that there is a ˆt ∈ (cid:2)T 0(y0), T(cid:1) so that
ˆy(ˆt; y0, ˆv) = 0 for some ˆv ∈ L∞(0, ˆt; U). Write ev for the zero extension of ˆv over (0, T ).
It is clear that ˆy(T ; y0,ev) = 0 and lims→T kevkL∞(s,T ;U ) = 0. These, together with (1.16),

(1.45) and (1.44), yield that

− S(T )y0 =Z T

0

S−1(T − t)Bev(t) dt = ˆy(T ; 0,ev) ∈ R0

74

T ⊂ RT .

(5.26)

By (5.24) and (5.26), we can apply (ii) of Proposition 2.13 to get that

kˆyT kRT = k − S(T )y0kRT = N(T, y0).

(5.27)

Meanwhile, since T ∈(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1) ⊆(cid:0)0, T 1(y0)(cid:1), we can apply (iii) of Lemma 3.3 to

ﬁnd that

N(T, y0) > 0.

(5.28)

From (5.27) and (5.28), we obtain that S(T )y0 6= 0 in RT , which along with (5.26), leads
to (5.25).

Next, by (H1) and (5.25), we can apply Theorem 5.1 (where yT = ˆyT is given by

(5.24)) to ﬁnd an f ∗ ∈ YT \ {0} so that for each minimal norm control ˆv∗ to (NP )ˆyT ,

hˆv∗(t), f ∗(t)iU =

max

kwkU ≤kˆyT kRT

hw, f ∗(t)iU for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).

(5.29)

Finally, we arbitrarily ﬁx a minimal norm control v∗ to (NP )T,y0. (The existence of
v∗ is guaranteed by (i) of Theorem 4.3, since T ∈ (T 0(y0), T 1(y0)).) Because of (5.26),
we can apply (iii) of Proposition 2.13 to see that v∗ is also a minimal norm control to
(NP )ˆyT . This, together with (5.29) and (5.27), indicates that v∗ satisﬁes (5.23) with f ∗
given by (5.29). This ends the proof of this theorem.

To get the maximum principle for (T P )M,y0, we need the following lemma.

Lemma 5.4. Suppose that (H1) holds. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0}, with T 0(y0) < T 1(y0). Then it
holds that

N(T 1(y0), y0) < N(T 0(y0), y0).

(5.30)

Furthermore, the following conclusions are true:

then u∗|(0,T (M,y0)) (the restriction of u∗ over (0, T (M, y0))) is a minimal norm control to
(NP )T (M,y0),y0.

(i) If M ∈(cid:0)N(T 1(y0), y0), N(T 0(y0), y0)(cid:1) and u∗ is a minimal time control to (T P )M,y0,
(ii) If T ∈(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1) and v∗ is a minimal norm control to (NP )T,y0, then the zero

extension of v∗ over R+ is a minimal time control to (T P )N (T,y0),y0.

Proof. Since (H1) holds, we can apply (i) of Proposition 3.6 to get (5.30). Next we will
prove the conclusions (i)-(ii) one by one.

(i) Arbitrarily ﬁx an M so that

N(T 1(y0), y0) < M < N(T 0(y0), y0).

(5.31)

75

Suppose that u∗ is a minimal time control to (T P )M,y0.
(Since T 0(y0) < T 1(y0), the
existence of u∗ is guaranteed by (i) of Theorem 4.5, as well as (5.31).) Then we have that

ku∗kL∞(R+;U ) ≤ M and y(T (M, y0); y0, u∗) = 0.

(5.32)

Meanwhile, since T 0(y0) < T 1(y0), by using (H1), we can apply (i) of Corollary 3.7 to see
that

(5.33)
By (5.32) and (5.33), we see that the problem (NP )T (M,y0),y0 makes sense, and ﬁnd that

T (M, y0) ∈ (0, ∞) and M = N(T (M, y0), y0).

ku∗|(0,T (M,y0))kL∞(0,T (M,y0);U ) ≤ N(T (M, y0), y0)

(5.34)

and

ˆy(T (M, y0); y0, u∗|(0,T (M,y0))) = 0.

(5.35)
From (5.34), (5.35) and (1.18), it follows that u∗|(0,T (M,y0)) is a minimal norm control to
the problem (NP )T (M,y0),y0.
(ii) Arbitrarily ﬁx a T so that

Suppose that v∗ is a minimal norm control to (NP )T,y0. ( The existence of v∗ is guaranteed

T 0(y0) < T < T 1(y0).

(5.36)

Then we have that

by (i) of Theorem 4.3, because of (5.36).) Writeev∗ for the zero extension of v∗ over R+.

(5.37)

(5.38)

Meanwhile, by (H1) and (5.36), we can apply (ii) of Corollary 3.7 to ﬁnd that

y(T ; y0,ev∗) = 0 and kev∗kL∞(R+;U ) ≤ N(T, y0).

N(T, y0) ∈ (0, ∞) and T = T (N(T, y0), y0).

From (5.37) and (5.38), it follows that the problem (T P )N (T,y0),y0 makes sense and that

y(cid:0)T (N(T, y0), y0); y0,ev∗(cid:1) = 0 and kev∗kL∞(R+;U ) ≤ N(T, y0).

These imply thatev∗ is a minimal time control to (T P )N (T,y0),y0.

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of this lemma.

Now, we will present a maximum principle for (T P )M,y0, with (M, y0) ∈ V2,2 ∪ V3,2
in next Theorem 5.5. Two facts deserve to be mentioned: First, it is not obvious, at
the ﬁrst sight, that the region of pairs (M, y0) described in Theorem 5.5, is the same as
V2,2 ∪V3,2. However, from (ii) of Remark 3.5 and the deﬁnitions of V2,2 and V3,2 (see (1.35)
and (1.37)), we can easily verify that they are the same. Second, the proof of Theorem 5.5
is based on Theorem 5.3 and the connections between (NP )T,y0 and (T P )M,y0 built up in
Corollary 3.7 and Lemma 5.4.

76

Theorem 5.5. Suppose that (H1) holds. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0).
Then

N(T 1(y0), y0) < N(T 0(y0), y0).

Furthermore, for each M ∈(cid:0)N(T 1(y0), y0), N(T 0(y0), y0)(cid:1), the following conclusions are

true:
(i) It holds that

T 0(y0) < T (M, y0) < T 1(y0).

(5.39)

(ii) There is a vector f ∗ ∈ YT (M,y0) \ {0} so that each minimal time control u∗ to (T P )M,y0
satisﬁes that

hu∗(t), f ∗(t)iU = max
kwkU ≤M

hw, f ∗(t)iU for a.e. t ∈(cid:0)0, T (M, y0)(cid:1).

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X \ {0} so that

T 0(y0) < T 1(y0).

By (H1) and (5.41), we can see from (5.30) that

N(T 1(y0), y0) < N(T 0(y0), y0).

Arbitrarily ﬁx a number M so that

N(T 1(y0), y0) < M < N(T 0(y0), y0).

(5.40)

(5.41)

(5.42)

(5.43)

We now are going to show the conclusions (i)-(ii) in this theorem one by one.
(i) By (H1) and (5.41), we can apply (i) of Corollary 3.7 (more precisely, apply (3.57))

to get both (5.39) and the fact that

M = N(T (M, y0), y0).

(5.44)

(ii) By (H1), (5.41) and (5.39), we can apply Theorem 5.3 to get a vector f ∗ ∈

YT (M,y0) \ {0} so that every minimal norm control v∗ to (NP )T (M,y0),y0 satisﬁes that

hv∗(t), f ∗(t)iU =

max

kwkU ≤N (T (M,y0),y0)

hw, f ∗(t)iU for a.e. t ∈(cid:0)0, T (M, y0)(cid:1).

(5.45)

Next, we suppose that u∗ is a minimal time control to (T P )M,y0. (The existence of u∗
is guaranteed by (i) of Theorem 4.5, because of (5.41) and (5.43).) Then by (H1), (5.41)
and (5.43), we can use (i) of Lemma 5.4 to see that u∗|(0,T (M,y0)) is a minimal norm control
to (NP )T (M,y0),y0. This, along with (5.45) and (5.44), leads to (5.40).

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of this theorem.

5.3 Bang-bang properties of minimal time and norm controls

In this section, we will present the bang-bang properties for (NP )T,y0, with (T, y0) ∈
W2,3 ∪ W3,2, and (T P )M,y0, with (M, y0) ∈ V2,2 ∪ V3,2, under the assumptions (H1) and
(H2). Their proof are based on Theorem 5.3 and Theorem 5.5.
Theorem 5.6. Suppose that (H1) and (H2) hold. Let y0 ∈ X\{0} satisfy that T 0(y0) <

T 1(y0). Then for each T ∈(cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1), (NP )T,y0 has the bang-bang property.
Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx y0 ∈ X\{0} so that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0). Let T ∈ (cid:0)T 0(y0), T 1(y0)(cid:1).

Then according to (i) of Theorem 4.3, (NP )T,y0 has at least one minimal norm control.
Arbitrarily ﬁx a minimal norm control v∗ to this problem. By (H1), we can apply Theorem
5.3 to ﬁnd a vector f ∗ ∈ YT \ {0} so that

hv∗(t), f ∗(t)iU =

max

kwkU ≤N (T,y0)

hw, f ∗(t)iU for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).

(5.46)

Meanwhile, since f ∗ 6= 0 in YT , we can derive from (H2) that f ∗(t) 6= 0 for a.e. t ∈ (0, T ).
This, along with (5.46), yields that kv∗(t)kU = N(T, y0) for a.e.
t ∈ (0, T ). Hence,
(NP )T,y0 has the bang-bang property. We end the proof of this theorem.

Theorem 5.7. Suppose that (H1) holds. Let y0 ∈ X\{0} satisfy that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0).
Then N(T 1(y0), y0) < N(T 0(y0), y0). If further assume that (H2) holds, then for each

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X \ {0} so that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0). By (H1), we can apply
(i) of Proposition 3.6 to ﬁnd that N(T 1(y0), y0) < N(T 0(y0), y0). Arbitrarily ﬁx an M ∈

M ∈(cid:0)N(T 1(y0), y0), N(T 0(y0), y0)(cid:1), (T P )M,y0 has the bang-bang property.
(cid:0)N(T 1(y0), y0), N(T 0(y0), y0)(cid:1). Then we can use (i) of Theorem 4.5 to ﬁnd that (T P )M,y0

has at least one minimal time control. Next, we arbitrarily ﬁx a minimal time control
u∗ to (T P )M,y0. Then by (H1), we can apply (ii) of Theorem 5.5 to ﬁnd a vector f ∗ in
YT (M,y0) \ {0} so that

hu∗(t), f ∗(t)iU = max
kwkU ≤M

hw, f ∗(t)iU for a.e. t ∈(cid:0)0, T (M, y0)(cid:1).

Meanwhile, since f ∗ 6= 0 in YT (M,y0), it follows from (H2) that

This, along with (5.47), yields that

f ∗(t) 6= 0 for a.e. t ∈(cid:0)0, T (M, y0)(cid:1).
ku∗(t)kU = M for a.e. t ∈(cid:0)0, T (M, y0)(cid:1).

Thus, (T P )M,y0 has at least one minimal time control and each minimal time control u∗
to this problem satisﬁes (5.48). Hence, (T P )M,y0 has the bang-bang property. this ends
the proof of this theorem.

6 Proofs of main results

This section is devoted to prove the main theorems of this paper. They are Theorem 1.4,
Theorem 1.5 and Theorem 1.9.

6.1 Some preliminaries

Before proving the main theorems of this paper, we introduce the two theorems (The-
orem 6.2 and Theorem 6.3), which concern with the conclusions (iii) and (iv) in Theo-
rem 1.5. The proofs of these two theorems are based on the next Lemma 6.1.

Lemma 6.1. Suppose that (H1) holds. Let

OT ,(cid:8)u ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) : ˆy(T ; 0, u) = 0(cid:9), with T ∈ (0, ∞).

Then OT is a closed and inﬁnitely dimensional subspace in L∞(0, T ; U).

Proof. Let 0 < T < ∞. It is clear that OT is a closed subspace in L∞(0, T ; U). It remains
to show that OT is of inﬁnite dimension. To this end, we deﬁne

Ot1,t2

,(cid:8)u ∈ OT : supp(u) ⊂ (t1, t2)(cid:9), 0 < t1 < t2 < T .

The rest of the proof is organized by two steps.

(6.1)

Step 1. To show that when 0 < t1 < t2 < T , Ot1,t2 is a closed subspace of OT with

dim Ot1,t2 ≥ 1

Deﬁne

YT,t1,t2

, {f ∈ L1(0, T ; U) : f |(t1,t2) = g|(t1,t2) for some g ∈ Yt2}.

(6.2)

We claim that

YT,t1,t2 is a closed proper subspace in L1(0, T ; U).

(6.3)

To this end, we ﬁrst show that YT,t1,t2 is closed in L1(0, T ; U). For this purpose, let
{fn}∞

n=1 ⊂ YT,t1,t2 satisfy that

Since {fn}∞
n ≥ 1, fn = gn over (t1, t2). This, as well as (6.4), yields that

n=1 ⊂ YT,t1,t2, from (6.2), there exists a sequence {gn}∞

fn → bf in L1(0, T ; U), as n → ∞.

(6.4)

n=1 ⊂ Yt2 so that for all

gn → bf in L1(t1, t2; U) as n → ∞.

79

(6.5)

Meanwhile, by (H1), we can use Lemma 2.5 to get the conclusion (iii) in Lemma 2.5.
This, as well as (6.5), indicates that {gn}∞
n=1 is a Cauchy sequence in L1(0, t2; U). Since
Yt2 is closed in L1(0, t2; U) (see (1.22)), we have that gn converges to a function ˆg in Yt2.

This, along with (6.5), shows that bf = ˆg over (t1, t2), which, combined with (6.2), implies
that bf ∈ YT,t1,t2. Hence, the subspace YT,t1,t2 is closed in L1(0, T ; U).

We next show that YT,t1,t2 is a proper subspace of L1(0, T ; U). In fact, for each f ∈

YT,t1,t2, we obtain from (6.2) and (iii) of Lemma 2.5 that there is p2 > 1 so that

f |(t1,s) ∈ Lp2(t1, s; U)

for all s ∈ (t1, t2).

(6.6)

However, it is clear that not every function in L1(0, T ; U) holds the property (6.6). Hence,
YT,t1,t2 is strictly contained in L1(0, T ; U). This ﬁnishes the proof of (6.3).

(which is L∞(0, T ; U)) so that

Now by (6.3), there is an h ∈ L1(0, T ; U) \ YT,t1,t2. Since YT,t1,t2 is closed subspace of
L1(0, T ; U), we can apply the Hahn-Banach separation theorem to ﬁnd a function uh in

huh(t), f (t)iU dt <Z T

(cid:0)L1(0, T ; U)(cid:1)∗
0 =Z T
For each g ∈ L1(cid:0)(0, t1) ∪ (t2, T ); U(cid:1), leteg(·) be the zero extension of g over (0, T ). Clearly,
it follows from (6.2) thateg ∈ YT,t1,t2. Then by the ﬁrst equality in (6.7), we ﬁnd that

huh(t), h(t)iU dt for all f ∈ YT,t1,t2.

(6.7)

0

0

0 =Z T

0

huh(t),eg(t)iU dt for all g ∈ L1(cid:0)(0, t1) ∪ (t2, T ); U(cid:1).

This yields that

uh = 0 over (0, t1) ∪ (t2, T ).

(6.8)

Meanwhile, for each z ∈ D(A∗), we deﬁne ψz : (0, T ) → U by

ψz(t) =(cid:26) B∗S∗(t2 − t)z,

0,

t ∈ (t1, t2),
t ∈ (0, t1] ∪ [t2, T ).

It follows from (6.2) and (1.22) that for all z ∈ D(A∗), ψz ∈ YT,t1,t2. Then we see from
(1.15), (6.8) and the ﬁrst equality in (6.7) that for each z ∈ D(A∗),

hˆy(t2; 0, uh), ziX = Z t2
= Z T

0

0

80

huh(t), B∗S∗(t2 − t)ziU dt

huh(t), ψz(t)iU dt = 0.

Since D(A∗) is dense in X, the above, as well as (6.8), yields that

ˆy(T ; 0, uh) = ˆy(t2; 0, uh) = 0,

which leads to that uh ∈ OT . This, along with (6.1) and (6.8), implies that uh ∈ Ot1,t2.

Finally, we see from the second equality in (6.7) that uh 6= 0 in L∞(0, T ; U). Hence,

we have that dim Ot1,t2 ≥ 1.

Step 2. To show that dim OT = +∞

By the conclusion in Step 1, we ﬁnd that

{0} 6= OT /2k+1,T /2k ⊂ OT for all k ∈ N+.

From (6.1), we see that

OT /2i+1,T /2i ∩ OT /2j+1,T /2j = {0} for all i, j ∈ N+, with i 6= j.

Take a sequence {uk} so that for each k ∈ N+, uk ∈ OT /2k+1,T /2k . Arbitrarily take a
ﬁnite subsequence {ukn}N
n=1 αnukn = 0.
Since for each k, the support of uk belongs to (T /2k+1, T /2k), we can easily derive from
the above equality that αn = 0 for all n ∈ {1, · · · , N}. So uk1, uk2, · · · , ukN are linearly
independent. Thus, we conclude that dim OT = ∞.

n=1 ⊂ R be so thatPN

n=1 from {uk}∞

k=1. Let {αn}N

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of this lemma.

Theorem 6.2. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy that

T 0(y0) < T 1(y0) and N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞.

Suppose that (H1) holds and that

N(T 0(y0), y0) < M < ∞.

(6.9)

(6.10)

Then (T P )M,y0 has inﬁnitely many diﬀerent minimal time controls so that among them,
any ﬁnite number of controls are linearly independent in L∞(R+; U).

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X \ {0} so that (6.9) holds. Then ﬁx an M so that (6.10)
holds. By (6.9) and (6.10), we can use (i) and (ii) of Corollary 4.8 to see that

T 0(y0) = T (M, y0) ∈ (0, ∞),

(6.11)

and to ﬁnd a minimal time control u∗ so that v∗ , u∗|(0,T 0(y0)) is a minimal norm control
to (NP )T 0(y0),y0. The latter, along with (6.11) and (6.10), yields that

y(T (M, y0); y0, u∗) = y(T 0(y0); y0, u∗) = ˆy(T 0(y0); y0, v∗) = 0

(6.12)

81

and

ku∗kL∞(0,T (M,y0);U ) = kv∗kL∞(0,T 0(y0);U ) = N(T 0(y0), y0) < M.

(6.13)

Next, since 0 < T 0(y0) < ∞ (see (6.11)), by (H1), we can use Lemma 6.1 to ﬁnd a

sequence {uk}∞

k=1 ⊂ L∞(0, T 0(y0); U) so that

ˆy(T 0(y0); 0, uk) = 0 for all k ∈ N+,

(6.14)

and so that any ﬁnite number of elements in {uk}∞
k=1 are linearly independent in the space
L∞(0, T 0(y0); U). Write ˆuk, k = 1, 2, · · · , for the zero extension of uk over R+. Then any
ﬁnite number of elements in {ˆuk}∞
k=1 are linearly independent in L∞(R+; U). Arbitrarily
ﬁx a k ∈ N+. It follows from (6.11) and (6.14) that

y(T (M, y0); 0, ˆuk) = 0.

Because of (6.10), we can take εk > 0 so that

εkkˆukkL∞(R+;U ) < M − N(T 0(y0), y0).

Deﬁne a control u∗

k as follows:

u∗
k

, εk ˆuk + χ(0,T (M,y0))u∗ over R+.

This, along with (6.12) and (6.15), yields that

(6.17)

y(T (M, y0); y0, u∗

k) = y(T (M, y0); y0, u∗) + εky(T (M, y0); 0, ˆuk) = 0.

(6.18)

At same time, it follows from (6.17), (6.16) and (6.13) that

ku∗

kkL∞(R+;U ) < M.

(6.19)

Since k was arbitrarily taken from N+, by (6.18) and (6.19), {u∗
minimal time controls to (T P )M,y0. (Each u∗

k is not a bang-bang control, see (6.19).)

k=1 is a sequence of

NXj=1

αjεkj ˆukj +(cid:16) NXj=1

αj(cid:17)χ(0,T (M,y0))u∗ = 0.

(6.22)

Since ˆuk1, . . . , ˆukN are linearly independent, we see from (6.22) that, to show (6.21), it
suﬃces to prove that

αj = 0.

NXj=1

By contradiction, suppose that (6.23) were not true. Then we would have

αj 6= 0.

NXj=1

(6.23)

(6.24)

By (6.24) and (6.22), we know that χ(0,T (M,y0))u∗ is a linear combination of ˆuk1, · · · , ˆukN .
This, along with (6.11) and (6.15), yields that

y(T 0(y0); 0, u∗) = y(T (M, y0); 0, u∗) = 0,

(6.25)

which, together with (6.12), implies that

y(T 0(y0); y0, 0) = y(T 0(y0); y0, u∗) − y(T 0(y0); 0, u∗) = 0.

Notice that T 0(y0) ∈ (0, ∞) (see (6.11)). So the problem (NP )T 0(y0),y0 is well deﬁned.
Then by (1.18) and (6.26), we see that N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0. By this, we can use (iv) of
Lemma 3.4 to ﬁnd that T 0(y0) = T 1(y0), which contradicts (6.9). So (6.23) is true and
then any ﬁnite number of controls in {u∗
k=1 are linearly independent in L∞(R+; U). We
end the proof of this theorem.

Theorem 6.3. Suppose that (H1) holds. Let y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisfy that

T 0(y0) = T 1(y0) < ∞.

(6.27)

Then for each M ∈ (0, ∞), (T P )M,y0 has inﬁnitely many diﬀerent minimal time controls
so that among them, any ﬁnite number of controls are linearly independent in L∞(R+; U).

83

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X \ {0} so that (6.27) holds. Let M ∈ (0, ∞). Then by
(6.27), we can use Corollary 4.11 to see that

0 < T 1(y0) = T (M, y0) = T 0(y0) < ∞

and to ﬁnd that the null control is a minimal time control to (T P )M,y0, i.e.,

y(T (M, y0); y0, 0) = 0.

(6.28)

(6.29)

Meanwhile, since 0 < T 0(y0) < ∞ (see (6.28)), by (H1), we can use Lemma 6.1 to ﬁnd

a sequence {uk}∞

k=1 ⊂ L∞(0, T 0(y0); U) so that

ˆy(T 0(y0); 0, uk) = 0 for all k ∈ N+,

(6.30)

and so that any ﬁnite number of elements in {uk}∞
k=1 are linearly independent in the space
L∞(0, T 0(y0); U). Write ˆuk, k = 1, 2, · · · , for the zero extension of uk over R+. Then any
ﬁnite number of elements in {ˆuk}∞
k=1 are linearly independent in L∞(R+; U). Arbitrarily
ﬁx a k ∈ N+. It follows from (6.28) and (6.30) that

y(T (M, y0); 0, ˆuk) = 0.

Since M > 0, we can take εk > 0 so that

Next, we deﬁne a control u∗

k in the following manner:

εkkˆukkL∞(R+;U ) < M.

u∗

, εk ˆuk over R+.

Then by (6.33), (6.29) and (6.31), we ﬁnd that

(6.31)

(6.32)

(6.33)

y(T (M, y0); y0, u∗

k) = y(T (M, y0); y0, 0) + εky(T (M, y0); 0, ˆuk) = 0.

(6.34)

Meanwhile, by (6.33) and (6.32), we see that

ku∗

kkL∞(R+;U ) < M.

(6.35)

Since k was arbitrarily taken from N+, it follows by (6.34) and (6.35) that for each k ∈ N+,
u∗
k is a minimal time control to (T P )M,y0 and has no the bang-bang property.

Finally, we will show that any ﬁnite number of controls in {u∗

k=1 are linearly inde-
pendent in L∞(R+; U). Here is the argument: Suppose that there are a ﬁnite subsequence
{u∗

k=1 and a sequence {αj}N

j=1 of {u∗

j=1 ⊂ R so that

αju∗

kj = 0.

NXj=1

84

(6.36)

Then we will have that

αj = 0 for each j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N}.

Indeed, by (6.36) and (6.33), it follows that

αjεkj ˆukj = 0.

NXj=1

(6.37)

(6.38)

Since ˆuk1, . . . , ˆukN are linearly independent, we ﬁnd that for each j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N},
αjεkj = 0. Because {εkj }N
j=1 ⊂ (0, ∞), we see that (6.37) holds. So any ﬁnite number of
controls in {u∗

k=1 are linearly independent in L∞(R+; U). This ends the proof.

6.2 Proofs of the main theorems

We begin with the proof of Theorem 1.4, which gives the BBP decomposition for (NP )T,y0.

Proof of Theorem 1.4. (i) First of all, we observe from (1.26) and (1.28)-(1.33) that

W = W1 ∪ W2 ∪ W3,

W1 = W1,1 ∪ W1,2,

W2 = W2,1 ∪ W2,2 ∪ W2,3 ∪ W2,4,

and

W3 = W3,1 ∪ W3,2 ∪ W3,3 ∪ W3,4.

To prove the conclusion (i), it suﬃces to show that

and

W =(cid:0) ∪2

j=1 W1,j(cid:1) ∪(cid:0) ∪4

j=1 W2,j(cid:1) ∪(cid:0) ∪4

j=1 W3,j(cid:1)

Wi,j ∩ Wi′,j′ = ∅, when (i, j) 6= (i′, j′).

(6.39)

(6.40)

(6.41)

(6.42)

(6.43)

(6.44)

The equality (6.43) follows from (6.39), (6.40), (6.41) and (6.42) at once. To show (6.44),
three observations are given in order: First, from (1.29), (1.31) and (1.33), we see that
W1, W2 and W3 are pairwise disjoint; Second, from (1.28), it follows that W1,1 and W1,2
are disjoint; Third, by (1.30) and (1.32), we see respectively that all W2,j, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are

85

pairwise disjoint, and that all W3,j, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are pairwise disjoint. The above three
observations, together with (6.40), (6.41) and (6.42), leads to (6.44). Thus, we end the
proof of the conclusion (i).

(ii) First, we let (T, y0) ∈ W1,2. Then by the deﬁnitions of W1,2 and W1 (see (1.28)

and (1.29), respectively), we have that

T 0(y0) ≤ T < ∞ and N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0.

(6.45)

By the last equation in (6.45), we can use (iv) of Lemma 3.4 to obtain that T 0(y0) =
T 1(y0) < ∞. From this and the ﬁrst inequality in (6.45), we can apply (ii) of Corollary
4.7 to see that the null control is the unique minimal norm control to (NP )T,y0. This,
along with (1.18), yields that N(T, y0) = 0. Hence, (NP )T,y0 has the bang-bang property.
Next, we let (T, y0) ∈ W2,4. Then by the deﬁnitions of W2,4 and W2 (see (1.30) and

(1.31), respectively), we have that

T 1(y0) ≤ T < ∞ and 0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞.

(6.46)

By the last equation in (6.46), we can apply the conclusion (iii) in Lemma 3.4 to obtain
that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0). From this and the ﬁrst inequality in (6.46), we can apply (ii) of
Corollary 4.6 to see that the null control is the unique minimal norm control to (NP )T,y0.
This, along with (1.18), yields that N(T, y0) = 0. Hence, (NP )T,y0 has the bang-bang
property.

Finally, we let (T, y0) ∈ W3,3. Then by the deﬁnitions of W3,3 and W3 (see (1.32) and

(1.33), respectively), we have that

T 1(y0) ≤ T < ∞ and N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞.

(6.47)

By (6.47), we can use (i) of Lemma 3.4 to obtain that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0). From this and
the ﬁrst inequality in (6.47), we can apply (ii) of Corollary 4.6 to see that the null control
is the unique minimal norm control to (NP )T,y0. This, along with (1.18), yields that
N(T, y0) = 0. Hence, (NP )T,y0 has the bang-bang property. This ends the proof of the
conclusion (ii).

(iii) First, we let (T, y0) ∈ W2,3. Then by the deﬁnition of W2,3 (see (1.30)), we
have that T 0(y0) < T < T 1(y0). From this and and the assumptions (H1)-(H2), we can
apply Theorem 5.6 to ﬁnd that (NP )T,y0 has the bang-bang property. The remainder is
to show that the null control is not a minimal norm control to (NP )T,y0. In fact, since
T 0(y0) < T < T 1(y0), it follows from (iii) of Lemma 3.3 that N(T, y0) > 0, from which,
we see that the null control is not a minimal norm control to (NP )T,y0.

Next, we let (T, y0) ∈ W3,2. By the deﬁnition of W3,2 (see (1.32)), we ﬁnd that T ∈
(T 0(y0), T 1(y0)). Then by the same way as that used for the above case that (T, y0) ∈ W2,3,

86

we see that (NP )T,y0 has the bang-bang property and the null control is not its minimal
norm control. This ends the proof of the conclusion (iii).

(iv) First we let (T, y0) ∈ W1,1. Then by the deﬁnitions of W1,1 and W1 (see (1.28)

and (1.29), respectively), we have that

0 < T < T 0(y0) and N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0.

(6.48)

From the last equation in (6.48), we can apply (iv) of Lemma 3.4 to see that T 0(y0) =
T 1(y0) < ∞. This, together with the ﬁrst inequality in (6.48), yields that

T 0(y0) = T 1(y0) and T ∈(cid:0)0, T 0(y0)(cid:1).

(6.49)

From (6.49), we can use (i) of Corollary 4.7 to ﬁnd that (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible
control and so does not hold the bang-bang property.

Next we let (T, y0) ∈ W2,1. Then by the deﬁnitions of W2,1 and W2 (see (1.30) and

(1.31), respectively), we have that

0 < T < T 0(y0) and 0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞.

(6.50)

By the second inequality in (6.50), we can use (iii) of Lemma 3.4 to get that T 0(y0) <
T 1(y0). This, along with the ﬁrst inequality in (6.50), yields that

0 < T 0(y0) < T 1(y0) and 0 < T < T 0(y0).

(6.51)

From (6.51), we can use (i) of Corollary 4.6 to get that (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible
control and so does not hold bang-bang property.

We now let (T, y0) ∈ W3,1. Then by the deﬁnitions of W3,1 and W3 (see (1.32) and

(1.33), respectively), we see that

T 0(y0) < ∞, 0 < T ≤ T 0(y0) and N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞.

(6.52)

By the ﬁrst inequality and the last equality in (6.52), we can use (i) of Lemma 3.4 to ﬁnd
that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0). This, together with (6.52), indicates that

0 < T 0(y0) < T 1(y0), 0 < T ≤ T 0(y0) and N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞.

(6.53)

In the case that T = T 0(y0), from the ﬁrst inequality in (6.53), we can use (i) of Corollary
4.6 to see that (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible control and so does not have the bang-bang
property. In the case when T < T 0(y0), from the last equality in (6.53), we can apply (v)
of Theorem 4.3 to ﬁnd that (NP )T,y0 has no any admissible control and so does not have
the bang-bang property.

87

Finally, we let (T, y0) ∈ W3,4. Then by the deﬁnitions of W3,4 and W3 (see (1.32) and

(1.33), respectively), we have that

0 < T < ∞, T 0(y0) = ∞ and N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞.

(6.54)

By the last two equalities in (6.54), we can use (i) of Lemma 3.4 to see that T 0(y0) =
T 1(y0) = ∞, which, along with the ﬁrst inequality in (6.54), yields that T 0(y0) = T 1(y0)
and 0 < T < T 0(y0). From these, we can apply (i) of Corollary 4.7 to ﬁnd that (NP )T,y0
has no any admissible control and so does not hold the bang-bang property. This ends
the proof of the conclusion (iv).

(v) Let (T, y0) ∈ W2,2. Then by the deﬁnitions of W2,2 and W2 (see (1.30) and (1.31),
respectively), we see that 0 < T = T 0(y0) < ∞ and 0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞. From
these, we can use (iii) of Theorem 4.3 to see that (NP )T,y0 has at least one minimal norm
control. This ends the proof of the conclusion (v).

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 1.4.

Next, we prove Theorem 1.5, which gives the BBP decompositions for (T P )M,y0.

Proof of Theorem 1.5. (i) First of all, we observe from (1.27) and (1.34)-(1.38) that

V = V1 ∪ V2 ∪ V3,

V2 = V2,1 ∪ V2,2 ∪ V2,3 ∪ V2,4,

and

To show the conclusion (i), it suﬃces to verify that

V3 = V3,1 ∪ V3,2 ∪ V3,3.

V = V1 ∪ (∪4

j=1V2,j) ∪ (∪3

j=1V3,j)

and

V1 ∩ Vi,j = ∅, Vi′,j′ ∩ Vi′′,j′′ = ∅ when (i′, j′) 6= (i′′, j′′).

(6.55)

(6.56)

(6.57)

(6.58)

(6.59)

First of all, the equality (6.58) follows from (6.55), (6.56) and (6.57) at once. To prove
(6.59), three observations are given in order: First, from (1.34), (1.36) and (1.38), we
see that V1, V2 and V3 are pairwise disjoint. Second, from (1.35), we ﬁnd that all V2,j,
j = 1, 2, 3, 4, are pairwise disjoint. Third, from (1.37), we ﬁnd that all V3,j, j = 1, 2, 3,
are pairwise disjoint. The above three observations, along with (6.56) and (6.57), yield
(6.59). Thus, we end the proof of the conclusion (i).

88

(ii) First we let (M, y0) ∈ V2,2. By the deﬁnitions of V2,2 and V2 (see (1.35) and (1.36)),

we have that

N(T 1(y0), y0) < M < N(T 0(y0), y0) and 0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞.

(6.60)

By the second inequality in (6.60), we can use (iii) of Lemma 3.4 to see that T 0(y0) <
T 1(y0). By this, the ﬁrst inequality in (6.60) and the assumptions (H1)-(H2), we can
apply Theorem 5.7 to see that (T P )M,y0 has the bang-bang property.

Next, we let (M, y0) ∈ V3,2. By the deﬁnitions of V3,2 and V3 (see (1.37) and (1.38)),

we ﬁnd that

T 0(y0) < ∞ and N(T 1(y0), y0) < M < ∞ = N(T 0(y0), y0).

(6.61)

From (6.61), we can use (i) of Lemma 3.4 to get that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0). By this, the second
conclusion in (6.61) and the assumptions (H1) and (H2), we can apply Theorem 5.7 to
see that (T P )M,y0 has the bang-bang property. This ends the proof of the conclusion (ii).
(iii) Let (M, y0) ∈ V2,4. By the deﬁnitions of V2,4 and V2 (see (1.35) and (1.36)), we

ﬁnd that

N(T 0(y0), y0) < M < ∞ and 0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞.

(6.62)

From the second inequality in (6.62), we can use (iii) of Lemma 3.4 to see that

T 0(y0) < T 1(y0).

(6.63)

By (6.63) and (6.62), we can use (i) and (ii) of Corollary 4.8 to ﬁnd respectively that

T (M, y0) = T 0(y0) ∈ (0, ∞),

(6.64)

and that (T P )M,y0 has a minimal time control u∗ so that u∗|(0,T 0(y0)) is a minimal norm
control to (NP )T 0(y0),y0. The later, together with (6.64) and the ﬁrst inequality in (6.62),
indicates that

ku∗kL∞(0,T (M,y0);U ) = ku∗kL∞(0,T 0(y0);U ) = N(T 0(y0), y0) < M.

This implies that (T P )M,y0 does not hold the bang-bang property.

Meanwhile, according to (iii) of Corollary 4.8, the null control is not a minimal time

control to (T P )M,y0.

The remainder is to show that (T P )M,y0 has inﬁnitely many diﬀerent minimal time
controls. Fortunately, this follows from Theorem 6.2, since we already have (6.63), (6.62)
and (H1). This ends the proof of the conclusion (iii).

(iv) Let (M, y0) ∈ V1. By the deﬁnition of V1 (see (1.34)), we ﬁnd that

N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0 < M < ∞.

(6.65)

89

Since N(T 0(y0), y0) = 0, it follows from (iv) of Lemma 3.4 that

T 0(y0) = T 1(y0) < ∞.

(6.66)

By (6.66) and (6.65), we can use (ii) of Corollary 4.11 to see that the null control is a
minimal time control to (T P )M,y0. From this, we see that (T P )M,y0 does not hold the
bang-bang property, since M > 0.

The remainder is to show that (T P )M,y0 has inﬁnitely many diﬀerent minimal time
controls. Fortunately, this follows from Theorem 6.3, since we already have (6.66) and
(H1). This ends the proof of the conclusion (iv).

(v) First, we let (M, y0) ∈ V3,3. Then by the deﬁnitions of V3,3 and V3 (see (1.37) and

(1.38)), we ﬁnd that

T 0(y0) = ∞ and N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞.

(6.67)

From (6.67), we can use (i) of Lemma 3.4 to see that T 0(y0) = T 1(y0) = ∞. By this, we
can apply Corollary 4.10 to ﬁnd that (T P )M,y0 has no any admissible control and so does
not hold the bang-bang property.

Next, we let (M, y0) ∈ V2,1. By the deﬁnitions of V2,1 and V2 (see (1.35) and (1.36)),

we have that

0 < M ≤ N(T 1(y0), y0) and 0 < N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞.

(6.68)

By the second inequality in (6.68), we can use (iii) of Lemma 3.4 to see that T 0(y0) <
T 1(y0). From this, the ﬁrst inequality in (6.68) and the assumption (H1), we can apply
(ii) of Corollary 4.9 to ﬁnd that (T P )M,y0 has no any admissible control and so does not
hold the bang-bang property.

Finally, we let (M, y0) ∈ V3,1. By the deﬁnitions of V3,1 and V3 (see (1.37) and (1.38)),

we have that

T 0(y0) < ∞, 0 < M ≤ N(T 1(y0), y0) and N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞.

(6.69)

By the last equality and the ﬁrst inequality in (6.69), we can use (i) of Lemma 3.4 to
get that T 0(y0) < T 1(y0). From this, the second inequality in (6.69) and the assumption
(H1), we can use (ii) of Corollary 4.9 to ﬁnd that (T P )M,y0 has no any admissible control
and so does not hold the bang-bang property. This ends the proof of the conclusion (v).
(vi) Let (T, y0) ∈ V2,3. Then by the deﬁnitions of V2,3 and V2 (see (1.35) and (1.36)),
we see that 0 < M = N(T 0(y0), y0) < ∞. This, along with (iii) of Lemma 3.4, yields that
T 0(y0) < T 1(y0) and N(T 0(y0), y0) = M < ∞. From these, we can use (ii) of Corollary
4.8 to ﬁnd that (T P )M,y0 has at least one minimal time control. This ends the proof of
the conclusion (vi).

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 1.5.

90

We end this section with proving Theorem 1.9. To do it, we need three propositions.
The ﬁrst one is the following Proposition 6.4. It presents some equivalent conditions for
the L∞-null controllability of (A, B). Though there have been many literatures on such
issue, we do not ﬁnd the exactly same version of Proposition 6.4 in literatures. For the
sake of the completeness of the paper, we provide the detailed proof in Appendix F.

Proposition 6.4. The following conclusions are equivalent:
(i) The pair (A∗, B∗) is L1-observable, i.e., the condition (H3) holds, i.e., for each T ∈
(0, ∞), there exists a positive constant C1(T ) so that

kS∗(T )zkX ≤ C1(T )Z T

0

kB∗S∗(T − t)zkU dt for all z ∈ D(A∗).

(6.70)

(ii) The pair (A, B) has the L∞-null controllability with a cost, i.e., for each T ∈ (0, ∞),
there is a positive constant C2(T ) so that for each y0 ∈ X, there exists a control v ∈
L∞(0, T ; U) satisfying that

ˆy(T ; y0, v) = 0 and kvkL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ C2(T )ky0kX.

(6.71)

(iii) The pair (A, B) is L∞-null controllable, i.e., for each T ∈ (0, ∞) and each y0 ∈ X,
there exists a control v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) so that ˆy(T ; y0, v) = 0.

Furthermore, when one of the above three conclusions is valid, the constants C1(T ) in

(6.70) and C2(T ) in (6.71) can be taken as the same number.

The next two propositions concern some connections among assumptions (H1)-(H4).

Proposition 6.5. Suppose that (H3) holds. Then (H1) is true.

Proof. Suppose that (H3) holds. Arbitrarily ﬁx T and t so that 0 < t < T < ∞. Then
by (H3), there exists a positive number C1(T − t) (depending on (T − t)) so that

which implies that

kB∗S∗(T − t − s)zkU ds for all z ∈ D(A∗),

kB∗S∗(T − s)zkU ds for all z ∈ D(A∗).

0

kS∗(T − t)zk ≤ C1(T − t)Z T −t
kS∗(T − t)zk ≤ C1(T − t)Z T
kB∗S∗(T − ·)zkL2(0,t;U ) = (cid:13)(cid:13)B∗S∗(t − ·)(cid:0)S∗(T − t)z(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:13)L2(0,t;U )

t

This, together with (2.2), yields that for each z ∈ D(A∗),

≤ pC(t)kS∗(T − t)zkX
≤ pC(t)C1(T − t)kB∗S∗(T − ·)zkL1(t,T ;U ),

91

where C(t) is given by (2.2). Then by the deﬁnition of YT (see (1.22)), the above yields
that

kgkL2(0,t;U ) ≤pC1(t)C(T − t)kgkL1(t,T ;U ) for all g ∈ YT .

Notice that (6.72) is exactly the statement (iii) in Lemma 2.5, where p2 = 2. Thus we can
apply Lemma 2.5 to get the conclusion (i) of Lemma 2.5 which is exactly the condition
(H1). Hence, (H1) follows from (H3). This ends the proof of this proposition.

(6.72)

Proposition 6.6. Suppose that (H3) and (H4) are true. Then (H2) holds.

Proof. Let T ∈ (0, ∞). Suppose that f ∈ YT satisﬁes that

f = 0 over E,

(6.73)

where the subset E ⊂ (0, T ) is of positive measure. We are going to use (H3) and (H4)
to show that

f = 0 over (0, T ).

(6.74)

When this is done, we obtain (H2) from (H3) and (H4).

The rest is to show (6.74). By (1.22), there exists a sequence {zn} ⊂ D(A∗) so that

B∗S∗(T − ·)zn → f (·) in L1(0, T ; U), as n → ∞.

(6.75)

In particular, {B∗S∗(T − ·)zn} is a Cauchy sequence in L1(0, T ; U). Take a sequence
{Tk} ⊂ (0, T ) so that Tk ր T . Then by (H3), we ﬁnd that for each k, {S∗(T − Tk)zn} is
a Cauchy sequence in X. Hence, for each k, there is a ˆzk ∈ X so that

S∗(T − Tk)zn → ˆzk strongly in X, as n → ∞.

(6.76)

By (6.76) and (2.2), we see that for each k, {B∗S∗(T − ·)zn} is a Cauchy sequence in
L2(0, Tk; U). This, along with (6.76) and (1.25), indicates that for each k,

B∗S∗(T − ·)zn → ]B∗S∗(Tk − ·)ˆzk in L2(0, Tk; U), as n → ∞.

(6.77)

By (6.75) and (6.77), we ﬁnd that for each k,

f (·) = ]B∗S∗(Tk − ·)ˆzk over (0, Tk).

(6.78)

Since Tk ր T , we see that for each k large enough, Ek , E ∩ (0, Tk) has a positive
measure. Then from (6.78) and (6.73), we observe that for each k large enough,

]B∗S∗(Tk − ·)ˆzk = 0 over Ek.

92

This, along with (H4), yields that for all k large enough,

]B∗S∗(Tk − ·)ˆzk = 0 over (0, Tk).

(6.79)

Now, (6.74) follows from (6.78) and (6.79). This ends the proof.

Remark 6.7. Since YT is the completion of the space XT in the norm k · kL1(0,T ;U ) (see
(1.22)), it is hard to characterize elements of YT in general. However, when the assump-
tion (H3) holds, we have that YT = YT , where

YT ,nf ∈ L1(0, T ; U) : ∀ t ∈ (0, T ), ∃ zt ∈ X s.t. f (·)|(0,t) = ]B∗S∗(t − ·)zto.

Indeed, on one hand, by (H3), we get (6.78), from which, it follows that YT ⊂ YT . On
the other hand, from (H1) and (ii) of Lemma 2.6, we ﬁnd that YT ⊂ YT . (Notice that
(H1) is ensured by (H3), see Proposition 6.5.) For time varying systems, we do not know
if these two spaces are the same in general. (In the proof of Lemma 2.6, we used the
time-invariance of the system.)

We now are on the position to show Theorem 1.9.

Proof of Theorem 1.9. (i) We ﬁrst claim that

T 0(y0) = 0 and N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞ for all y0 ∈ X \ {0}.

(6.80)

Indeed, by (H3), we can use Proposition 6.4 to get the L∞-null controllability for (A, B),
which, along with the deﬁnition of T 0(·) (see (1.19)), yields the ﬁrst equality in (6.80).
This, together with (iv) of Lemma 3.3, leads to the second equality in (6.80).

We next claim that

W = W3,2 ∪ W3,3.

(6.81)

In fact, by the second equality in (6.80) and the deﬁnition of W1 and W2 (see (1.29) and
(1.31)), we ﬁnd that W1 ∪ W2 = ∅. Meanwhile, by the ﬁrst equality in (6.80) and the
deﬁnitions of W3,1 and W3,4 (see (1.32)), we ﬁnd that W3,1 ∪ W3,4 = ∅. These, along with
(i) of Theorem 1.4, lead to (6.81).

We then claim that

V = V3,1 ∪ V3,2.

(6.82)

Indeed, by the second equality in (6.80) and the deﬁnitions of V1 and V2 (see (1.34) and
(1.36)), we see that V1 ∪ V2 = ∅. Meanwhile, the ﬁrst equality in (6.80) and the deﬁnition
of V3,3 (see (1.37)), we ﬁnd that V3,3 = ∅. These, along with (i) of Theorem 1.5, lead to
(6.82).

93

Now, (1.41) follows from (6.81) and (6.82) at once.
Finally, we verify (1.42). On one hand, by the deﬁnitions of γ1 and W2,2 (see (1.39)
and (1.30)), we see that γ1 = W2,2. On the other hand, from (i) of Lemma 3.3 and (ii) of
Lemma 3.2, it follows that

N(T 0(y0), y0) ≥ N(T 1(y0), y0) for all y0 ∈ X \ {0}.

Then by the deﬁnitions of γ2 and V2,3 (see (1.40) and (1.35)), one can directly check that
γ2 = V2,3. Since we already knew that W2 = ∅, V2 = ∅, W2,2 ⊂ W2 and V2,3 ⊂ V2, (1.42)
follows at once. Thus we end the proof of the conclusion (i) of Theorem 1.9.

(ii) Since (H3) and (H4) hold, we ﬁnd from Proposition 6.5 and Proposition 6.6 that
both (H1) and (H2) hold. Then by the conclusions (ii) and (v) of Theorem 1.5, as well
as the second equality in (1.41), we get the conclusion (ii) of Theorem 1.9.

(iii) By (H3) and (H4), we can use Proposition 6.5 and Proposition 6.6 to get (H1)
and (H2). Then by (ii) and (iii) of Theorem 1.4, as well as the ﬁrst equality in (1.41), we
are led to the conclusion (iii) of Theorem 1.9.

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 1.9.

7 Applications

Two applications of the main theorems of this paper will be given in this section. The ﬁrst
one is an application of Theorem 1.9, while the second one is an application of Theorem
1.4, Theorem 1.5.

7.1 Application to boundary controlled heat equations

In this subsection, we will use Theorem 1.9 to study the BBP decompositions for minimal
time and minimal norm control problems for boundary controlled heat equations. We
begin with introducing the controlled equations. Let Ω ⊂ Rn, n ≥ 1, be a bounded
domain with a smooth boundary ∂Ω. Let Γ be a nonempty open subset of ∂Ω. Consider
the following two controlled equations:

∂ty − ∆y = 0
y = u
y = 0
y(0) = y0

in Ω × (0, ∞),
on Γ × (0, ∞),
on
in Ω

(∂Ω \ Γ) × (0, ∞),

and



∂ty − ∆y = 0
y = v
y = 0
y(0) = y0

in Ω × (0, T ),
on Γ × (0, T ),
on
in Ω.

(∂Ω \ Γ) × (0, T ),

(7.2)

Here, y0 ∈ H −1(Ω), 0 < T < ∞, u ∈ L∞(R+; L2(Γ)) and v ∈ L∞(0, T ; L2(Γ)). Write
y1(·; y0, u) and ˆy1(·; y0, v) for the solutions of (7.1) and (7.2), respectively.

We will put the above systems in our framework where X , H −1(Ω), U , L2(Γ),
A , A1 and B , B1. Here, A1 = ∆, with D(A1) = H 1
0 (Ω), and B1 is deﬁned in the
following manner: Let D : L2(∂Ω) → L2(Ω) be deﬁned by Dv , fv, for all v ∈ L2(∂Ω),
where fv solves the equation

(−∆f = 0

f = v

in Ω,
on ∂Ω.

(7.3)

Then let B1 , −∆D. We regard L2(Γ) as a subspace of L2(∂Ω). Let X−1 , (D(A∗

1) with respect to the pivot space X.

1))′ be

0(Ω) for the complexiﬁcations of H −1(Ω) and H 1

To prove that the above X, U and (A1, B1) are in our framework, we will use some
results in [39] where both state and control spaces are assumed to be complex Hilbert
spaces. Thus, we will consider the complexiﬁcations of our spaces. Write H−1(Ω) and
0 (Ω), respectively. Write X , H−1(Ω)
H1
and U , L2(Γ; C). Let A1 , ∆, with D(A1) = H1
0(Ω). Deﬁne D : L2(∂Ω; C) →
L2(Ω; C) given by Dw = gw, for all w ∈ L2(∂Ω; C), where gw solves (7.3) with v = w.
Then let B1 , −∆D. The space L2(Γ; C) is regarded as a subspace of L2(∂Ω; C). Let
X−1 , (D(A∗
1) with respect to the pivot space X . Then, from [39,
Proposition 10.7.1], it follows that A1 generates a C0-semigroup {S1(t)}t∈R+ over H−1(Ω);
B1 ∈ L(U; X−1) \ {0} is an admissible control operator for the semigroup {S1(t)}t∈R+.

1))′ be the dual of D(A∗

Several observations are given in order: First, A1|D(A1) = A1 and B1|L2(Γ) = B1;
Second, {S1(t)|X}t∈R+ is a C0-semigroup over H −1(Ω), with its generator A1; Third,
B1 ∈ L(U, X−1) \ {0} is an admissible control operator for the semigroup {S1(t)|X}t∈R+.
From these observations, we see that if S1(t) , S1(t)|X, t ∈ R+, then the systems (7.1)
and (7.2) can be rewritten respectively as

y′(t) = A1y(t) + B1u(t), t > 0; y(0) = y0;

y′(t) = A1y(t) + B1v(t), 0 < t ≤ T ; y(0) = y0.

The corresponding two optimal control problems are as follows: The ﬁrst one is the
minimal time control problem (T P )M,y0

, with y0 ∈ H −1(Ω) \ {0} and M ∈ (0, ∞):

1

T1(M, y0) , {ˆt > 0 : ∃ u ∈ U M
1

s.t. y1(ˆt; y0, u) = 0},

95

where

U M
1

, {u ∈ L∞(R+, L2(Γ)) : ku(t)kL2(Γ) ≤ M a.e. t ∈ R+}.

The second one is the minimal norm control problem (NP )T,y0
and T ∈ (0, ∞)) as follows:

1

, (with y0 ∈ H −1(Ω) \ {0}

N1(T, y0) , inf{kvkL∞(0,T ;L2(Γ))

: ˆy1(T ; y0, v) = 0}.

Lemma 7.1. The conditions (H3) and (H4) hold for the pair (A1, B1). Furthermore,
N1(T 1(y0), y0) = 0 for each y0 ∈ H −1(Ω) \ {0}, where T 1(y0) is given by (1.20) where
{S(t)}t∈R+ is replaced by {S1(t)}t∈R+.

Proof. First, the condition (H3) follows from Proposition 6.4 and the L∞-null boundary
controllability of the heat equation (see, for instance, subsection 3.2.1 in [44]).

Next, we prove that (H4) holds for (A1, B1). For this purpose, let 0 < T < ∞ and

E ⊂ (0, T ) be a measurable subset of positive measure. Then ﬁx a ˆz ∈ X so that

]B∗
1S∗

1(T − ·)ˆz = 0 over E,

(7.4)

where ]B∗
1S∗
show that

1(T − ·)ˆz is given by (1.25). We will use the real analyticity of {S1(t)}t∈R to

]B∗
1S∗

1(T − ·)ˆz = 0 over (0, T ).

(7.5)

Indeed, from subsection 3.2.1 in [44], it follows that the semigroup {S1(t)}t∈R+ can be
extended to an analytic semigroup. Thus, the semigroup {S∗
1 (t)}t∈R+ is also analytic.
Then by [29, Theorem 5.2 in Chapter 2], we ﬁnd that

S∗
1 (·) is real analytic over (0, ∞); and kS∗

1 (t)kL(X ,D(A∗

where the constant bC is independent of t > 0. Since S1(·)|X = S1(·) over R+, we have

1 (·) over R+, which, along with (7.6), implies that

1 (·)|X = S∗

that S∗

S∗
1(·) is real analytic over (0, ∞); and kS∗

1(t)kL(X,D(A∗

1)) ≤ bC/t, t > 0,

1)) ≤ bC/t, t > 0.

(7.6)

(7.7)

Arbitrarily ﬁx an ε ∈ (0, T ) so that

|E ∩ (0, T − ε)| > 0.

(7.8)

Let {zn} ⊂ D(A∗
the second conclusion in (7.7) that when n goes to ∞,

1) so that limn→∞ zn = ˆz in X. Because B1 ∈ L(D(A∗

1), U), we ﬁnd from

1(·)ˆzkL2(ε,T ;U ) = kB∗

1S∗

1 (· − ε)S∗

1(ε)(zn − ˆz)kL2(ε,T ;U ) → 0.

96

This, along with (1.25), yields that

]B∗
1S∗

1S∗

1(T − ·)ˆz over (0, T − ε),
which, together with the ﬁrst conclusion in (7.7), shows that ]B∗
1S∗
over (0, T − ε). Then, by (7.8) and (7.4), we see that

1(T − ·)ˆz = B∗

1(T − ·)ˆz is real analytic

]B∗
1S∗

1 (T − ·)ˆz = 0 over (0, T − ε).

Sending ε → 0 in the above leads to (7.5). Hence, (H4) holds for (A1, B1).

Finally, we will prove that

N1(T 1(y0), y0) = 0 for all y0 ∈ H −1(Ω) \ {0}.

(7.9)

According to (vi) of Lemma 3.3, (7.9) is equivalent to that

N1(∞, y0) = 0 for all y0 ∈ H −1(Ω) \ {0}.

(7.10)
To prove (7.10), we arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ H −1(Ω) \ {0} and then ﬁx a ˆt ∈ (0, ∞). Notice
that the semigroup {S1(t)}t≥0 has the following property: there exist C > 0 and δ > 0,
independent of ˆt, so that

kS1(ˆt)y0kH −1(Ω) ≤ Ce−δˆtky0kH −1(Ω).

(7.11)

Meanwhile, according to the L∞-null controllability of the boundary controlled heat equa-
tion, there exist a positive constant C ′ (independent of ˆt) and a control uˆt ∈ L∞(0, 1; L2(Γ))
so that

ˆy1(1; S1(ˆt)y0, uˆt) = 0 and kuˆtkL∞(0,1;L2(Γ)) ≤ C ′kS1(ˆt)y0kH −1(Ω).

(7.12)

Deﬁne another control

vˆt(τ ) =(0,

uˆt(τ − ˆt),

τ ∈ (0, ˆt],
τ ∈ (ˆt, ˆt + 1).

From this and (7.12), we ﬁnd that

ˆy1(ˆt + 1; y0, vˆt) = ˆy1(1; S1(ˆt)y0, uˆt) = 0;

kvˆtkL∞(0,ˆt+1;L2(Γ)) = kuˆtkL∞(0,1;L2(Γ)) ≤ C ′kS1(ˆt)y0kH −1(Ω).
These, along with the optimality of N1(ˆt + 1, y0) and (7.11), yield that

N1(ˆt + 1, y0) ≤ kvˆtkL∞(0,ˆt+1;L2(Γ)) ≤ C ′kS1(ˆt)y0kH −1(Ω) ≤ C ′Ce−δˆtky0kH −1(Ω).

By this and the ﬁrst equality in (1.21), we obtain (7.10). Hence, (7.9) has been proved.
This ends the proof of this lemma.

The BBP decompositions for (A1, B1) are presented in the following Theorem 7.2:

Theorem 7.2. Let W, W3,2, V and V3,2 be respectively given by (1.26), (1.32), (1.27)
and (1.37), where (A, B) = (A1, B1). Then the following conclusions are true:
(i) W = W3,2 and V = V3,2.
(ii) For each (M, y0) ∈ (0, ∞) × (H −1(Ω) \ {0}), the problem (T P )M,y0
property.
(iii) For each (T, y0) ∈ (0, ∞) × (H −1(Ω) \ {0}), the problem (NP )T,y0
property and the null control is not a minimal norm control to this problem.

Proof. (i) By Lemma 7.1, we see that (H3) and (H4) holds for (A1, B1). Then we can use
Theorem 1.9 to ﬁnd that

W = W3,2 ∪ W3,3 and V = V3,1 ∪ V3,2.

(7.13)

On one hand, by the backward uniqueness property for {S1(t)}t∈R+, we have that T 1(y0) =
∞ for all y0 ∈ X\{0}. On the other hand, by Lemma 7.1, we also have that N1(T 1(y0), y0) =
0 for all y0 ∈ H −1(Ω) \ {0}. These, along with the deﬁnitions of W3,3 and V3,1 (see (1.32)
(1.37)), yield that W3,3 = ∅ and V3,1 = ∅ in this case. From this and (7.13), we get the
conclusion (i) of this theorem.

(ii) Notice that V = (0, ∞) × (H −1(Ω) \ {0}) in this case. (For the deﬁnition of V,
see (1.27).) Then by the second equality in the conclusion (i) of this theorem and the
assumptions (H3) and (H4), we can apply (ii) of Theorem 1.9 to get the conclusion (ii) of
this theorem.

(iii) Notice that W = (0, ∞) × (H −1(Ω) \ {0}) in this case. (For the deﬁnition of
W, see (1.26)) Then by the ﬁrst equality in the conclusion (i) of this theorem and the
assumptions (H3) and (H4), we can apply (iii) of Theorem 1.9 to get the conclusion (iii)
of this theorem.

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of this theorem.

Remark 7.3. (i) From Theorem 7.2, we see that the BBP decomposition for (NP )T,y0
has only one part which is W = (0, ∞) × (H −1(Ω) \ {0}) and that for each (T, y0) in
W, the corresponding (NP )T,y0
has the bang-bang property. The reason to cause such
decomposition is that (A1, B1) is L∞-null controllable. The same can be said about the
BBP decomposition for (NP )T,y0 built up in Theorem 1.9.

(ii) From Theorem 7.2, we see that the BBP decomposition for (T P )M,y0

has only one
part which is V = (0, ∞)×(H −1(Ω)\{0}) and that for each (M, y0) in V, the corresponding
(T P )M,y0
has the bang-bang property. The reasons to cause such decomposition are that
(A1, B1) is L∞-null controllable and N1(T 1(y0), y0) = 0 for all y0 ∈ (0, ∞)×(H −1(Ω)\{0}).

(Compare this BBP decomposition with the BBP decomposition (P1) given by (1.8).) The
above-mentioned second property (i.e., N1(T 1(y0), y0) = 0 for all y0 ∈ (0, ∞) × (H −1(Ω) \
{0})) holds, because solutions of the controlled system (governed by (A1, B1)), with the
null control, tend to zero as time goes to inﬁnity.

7.2 Application to some special controlled evolution systems

In this subsection, we will use Theorem 1.4 and Theorem 1.5 to study the BBP decom-
positions for minimal time and minimal norm control problems in a special setting. The
controlled system in this setting is taken from [15].

Let X and U be two real separable Hilbert spaces. Let A , A2 and B , B2, where
A2 and B2 are deﬁned in the following manner: Arbitrarily ﬁx a Riesz basis {φj}j≥1 in X
and a biorthogonal sequence {ψj}j≥1 of the aforementioned Riesz basis. Take a sequence
Λ , {λj}j≥1 ⊂ R+ so that

0 < λ1 < λ2 < · · · < λj < · · · ; and Σj≥11/λj < ∞.

2) with respect to the pivot space X). Then let

One can directly check the following facts: First, the operator A2 generates a C0-

semigroup {S2(t)}t∈R+ over X; Second, the semigroup {S2(t)}t∈R+ has the expression:

S2(t)x =

∞Xj=1

xje−λjtφj, t ≥ 0,

for each x =

Third, the dual semigroup {S∗

ˆxje−λj tψj, t ≥ 0,

for each x =

∞Xj=1

xjφj ∈ X.

(7.16)

ˆxjψj ∈ X.

(7.17)

In this setting, the systems (1.13) and (1.14) read respectively as follows:

y′(t) = A2y(t) + B2u(t), t > 0; y(0) = y0;

(7.18)

99

y′(t) = A2y(t) + B2v(t), 0 < t ≤ T ; y(0) = y0.

(7.19)

Here, y0 ∈ X, 0 < T < ∞, u ∈ L∞(R+; U) and v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U). Write y2(·; y0, u) and
ˆy2(·; y0, v) for the solutions of (7.18) and (7.19), respectively. There are many controlled
PDEs governed by (A2, B2), we refer the readers to [15], [16] and [17].

For each y0 ∈ X \ {0} and each M ∈ (0, ∞), we consider the minimal time control

problem:

where

(T P )M,y0

T2(M, y0) , inf{ˆt > 0 : ∃ u ∈ U M

s.t. y(ˆt; y0, u) = 0},

, {u ∈ L∞(R+; U) : ku(t)kU ≤ M a.e. t ∈ R+}.

For each y0 ∈ X \ {0} and each T ∈ (0, ∞), we consider the minimal norm control
problem:

(NP )T,y0

2

N2(T, y0) , inf{kvkL∞(0,T ;U )

: ˆy2(T ; y0, v) = 0}.

We will prove that (A2, B2) satisﬁes (H1) and (H2). To do this, we need three lemmas.
The ﬁrst one is very similar to [17, Lemma 4.6]. We will give its proof in Appendix G of
this paper. To state it, we deﬁne

Here, p|(0,T ) denotes the restriction of p on (0, T ).

Notice that each element in P eU is a vector-valued function, with its domain C and its

(7.24)

where, Sε,θ0 and P eU are deﬁned by (7.21) and (7.23), respectively, and f |(0,T ) denotes the
restriction of f on (0, T ).

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx f ∈ P eU . Then by (7.23), there is N ∈ N+ and {cj}N

(independent of f and v) so that

|hf (z), vi eU | ≤ C1(θ0, ε, T )e−C2(θ0)Re zZ T
Since for each z ∈ Sε,θ0, the above inequality holds for all v ∈ eU , we ﬁnd that for each

Since f was arbitrarily taken from P eU , the above inequality leads to (7.24). This ends
the proof of this lemma.

With the aid of Lemma 7.5, we obtain the third lemma which will play a key role in

the proof of the conclusion that (H1) and (H2) hold for (A2, B2).

Lemma 7.6. Let θ0 ∈ (0, π
(which is deﬁned by (1.22) with (A∗, B∗) being replaced by (A∗

2 ). Then for each T ∈ (0, ∞), each ε ∈ (0, T ) and each f ∈ YT

(7.26)

Proof. Let θ0 ∈ (0, π

First of all, since {ψj}j≥1 is a biorthogonal sequence of the Riesz basis {φj}j≥1 in X, it
follows by (7.15) that each element w ∈ D(A∗

kgN|Sε,θ0

kL∞(Sε,θ0 ; eU) ≤ C1(θ0, ε, ε)kgN|(0,ε)kL1(0,ε; eU),

102

where C1(θ0, ε, ε) is given by (7.24). Since for each t ∈ R+, we have that gN (t) ∈ U (see
(7.31) and (7.29)), the above inequality can be rewritten as:

kgN|Sε,θ0

kL∞(Sε,θ0 ; eU) ≤ C1(θ0, ε, ε)kgN|(0,ε)kL1(0,ε;U ),

(7.34)
N =1 is a Cauchy sequence in L1(0, ε; U). From this and (7.33), we can

by (7.35) and (7.34), we can pass to the limit for N → ∞ in (7.33) to see that the above

We claim that

First, by (7.31), we see that for each N ∈ N+, the function gN |Sε,θ0

egε,f : Sε,θ0 → eU is continuous and weakly analytic over Sε,θ0.

gN |Sε,θ0

along with (7.35), yields that the functionegε,f is continuous over Sε,θ0, and that
Next, we prove the weak analyticity of the functionegε,f . Arbitrarily ﬁx a v ∈ eU . By

(7.37), we ﬁnd that

Meanwhile, by (7.31), we see that for each N ∈ N+, the function z → hgN|Sε,θ0

We now show that the above function egε,f satisﬁes (7.25). Indeed, by (7.21), we see

that (ε, T ) ⊂ Sε,θ0. This, together with (7.37), yields that

Proposition 7.7. The condition (H1), with p0 = 2, and the condition (H2) hold for
(A2, B2).

2, B∗

Proof. From Lemma 2.5, we see that in order to show the condition (H1) (with p0 = 2)
for (A2, B2), it suﬃces to prove the property (iii) in Lemma 2.5 (with p2 = 2) for (A2, B2).
To prove the later, we arbitrarily ﬁx ˆt and T so that 0 < ˆt < T < ∞. Let f ∈ YT , which
is deﬁned by (1.22) with (A∗, B∗) being replaced by (A∗
2). Then by Lemma 7.6 (where
ε = T − ˆt), we see that f satisﬁes (7.25) and (7.26) (with ε = T − ˆt) for some continuous
2 ). By (7.25), one can

and weakly analytic functionegε,f : Sε,θ0 → eU with some θ0 ∈ (0, π

easily check that

kegε,f (·)kL∞(Sε,θ0 ; eU ) ≥ kegε,f|(ε,T )(·)kL∞(ε,T ; eU) ≥ kegε,f|(ε,T )(T − ·)kL∞(0,ˆt; eU )

= kf (·)kL∞(0,ˆt;U ) ≥ ˆt−1/2kf (·)kL2(0,ˆt;U ).

This, along with (7.26) (where ε = T − ˆt), yields that

kf kL2(0,ˆt;U ) ≤ ˆt1/2C1(θ0, ε, ε)kf kL1(ˆt,T ;U )

, C(T, ˆt, θ0)kf kL1(ˆt,T ;U ),

which leads to the property (iii) in Lemma 2.5 (with p2 = 2) for (A2, B2). Hence, (H1)
with p0 = 2 holds for (A2, B2).

We next show that (H2) holds for (A2, B2). Arbitrarily ﬁx T ∈ (0, ∞). Assume that

there is f ∈ YT and a subset E ⊂ (0, T ) with a positive measure so that

We will show that

f = 0 over E.

f = 0 over (0, T ).

In fact, since |E| > 0, we can arbitrarily take ε ∈ (0, |E|). It is clear that

|E ∩ (0, T − ε)| ≥ |E| − ε > 0.

(7.41)

(7.42)

(7.43)

Since f ∈ YT , by Lemma 7.6, we see that f satisﬁes (7.25) and (7.26) for some continuous
2 ). Then by (7.25) and

and weakly analytic functionegε,f : Sε,θ0 → eU with some θ0 ∈ (0, π
the weak analyticity of egε,f , we ﬁnd that for each v ∈ U, the function t → hf (t), viU is

real analytic on (0, T − ε). This, along with (7.41) and (7.43), yields that for each v ∈ U,

hf (t), viU = 0 for each t ∈ (0, T − ε).

Sending ε → 0 in the above leads to (7.42). Hence, (H2) holds for (A2, B2). This ends
the proof.

To get the BBP decompositions for (T P )M,y0

and (NP )T,y0

, we also need the following

lemma:

Lemma 7.8. Let functions T 0(·) and T 1(·) be given respectively by (1.19) and (1.20)
where (A, B) = (A2, B2). Then the following conclusions are true:
(i) For each y0 ∈ X \ {0}, T 1(y0) = ∞.
(ii) If y0 ∈ X \ {0} satisﬁes that T 0(y0) < ∞, then N2(T 1(y0), y0) = 0.

Proof. (i) By contradiction, suppose that T 1(y0) < ∞ for some y0 ∈ X \ {0}. Then from
(1.20), we see that

Arbitrarily ﬁx a w0 ∈ X. Then we see from (7.44) that

S2(T )y0 = 0 for each T ∈(cid:0)T 1(y0), ∞(cid:1).
hS2(T )y0, w0iX = 0 for each T ∈(cid:0)T 1(y0), ∞(cid:1).

Since {ψj}j≥1 is a biorthogonal sequence of the Riesz basis {φj}j≥1 in X, we can write y0
and w0 in the following manner:

y0 =

(7.47)

hS2(t)y0, w0iX =

(7.48)

Since λk > 0 for all k ≥ 1, and because the function z →PN

k=1 e−λkzy0,kw0,k (N ∈ N+) is
analytic over C+, it follows from (7.48) and (7.47) that the function t → hS2(t)y0, wiX is
real analytic over (0, ∞). This, along with (7.45), yields that hS2(T )y0, w0iX = 0 for each
T ∈ (0, ∞). Because w0 was arbitrarily taken from X, we conclude from the above that
S2(T )y0 = 0 for each T ∈ (0, ∞). This implies that y0 = limT →0+ S2(T )y0 = 0, which
contradicts the assumption that y0 ∈ X \ {0}. Hence, T 1(y0) = ∞.

(7.54)

These, together with (7.22), yield that there exist two positive constants C1 and C2,
independent of w, so that for each s ∈ (2ˆt, ∞),

|hS2(s)y0, wiX| = (cid:12)(cid:12)g1(cid:0)(s − ˆt) + ˆt(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C1e−C2(s−ˆt)Z ˆt

This, along with (vi) of Lemma 3.3, yields that the conclusion (ii) is true.

In summary, we end the proof of Lemma 7.8.

The BBP decompositions for (A2, B2) are presented in the following Theorem 7.9.

Theorem 7.9. Let W, W2,j (j = 1, 2, 3), W3,j (j = 1, 2, 4), V, V2,j (j = 2, 3, 4) and V3,j
(j = 2, 3) be respectively given by (1.26), (1.30), (1.32), (1.27), (1.35) and (1.37) where
(A, B) = (A2, B2). Then the following conclusions are valid:

108

(i) The set W is the disjoint union of the above mentioned subsets Wi,j, and V is the
disjoint union of the above mentioned subsets Vi,j.
(ii) For each (T, y0) ∈ W2,1 ∪ W3,1 ∪ W3,4, (NP )T,y0

does not hold the bang-bang property; For each (T, y0) ∈ W2,3 ∪ W3,2, (NP )T,y0

For each (T, y0) ∈ W2,2, (NP )T,y0
(iii) For each (M, y0) ∈ V3,3, (T P )M,y0
has no any admissible control and does not hold the

has the bang-bang property;
For each (M, y0) ∈ V2,4, (T P )M,y0
has inﬁnitely many diﬀerent minimal time controls (not
including the null control), and does not hold the bang-bang property; For each (M, y0) ∈

has at least one minimal time control.

Proof. By Proposition 7.7, we see that (H1) and (H2) hold for (A2, B2). Thus, all con-
clusions in Theorem 1.4 and Theorem 1.5 are true. From these conclusions, we see that
to prove this theorem, it suﬃces to show that

W1,1 ∪ W1,2 ∪ W2,4 ∪ W3,3 = ∅; V1 ∪ V2,1 ∪ V3,1 = ∅.

(7.59)

Here, W1,j (j = 1, 2), W2,4, W3,3, V1, V2,1 and V3,1 are respectively given by (1.28), (1.30),
(1.32), (1.34), (1.35) and (1.37), where (A, B) = (A2, B2).

To show (7.59), we use Lemma 7.8 to get that

T 1(y0) = ∞ and N2(T 1(y0), y0) = 0 for all y0 ∈ X \ {0}.

(7.60)

By the ﬁrst equality in (7.60) and (iv) of Lemma 3.4, we deduce that

N2(T 0(y0), y0) > 0 for all y0 ∈ X \ {0}.

(7.61)

We now show the ﬁrst equality in (7.59). On one hand, by the deﬁnitions of W1,j
(j = 1, 2) (see (1.28)), we ﬁnd from (7.61) that W1,1 ∪ W1,2 is empty. On the other hand,
by contradiction, suppose that W2,4 ∪ W3,3 were not empty. Then there would be a pair
( ˆT , ˆy0) ∈ W2,4 ∪ W3,3. Hence, by the deﬁnitions of W2,4 ∪ W3,3 (see (1.30) and (1.32)), it
follows that

T 1(ˆy0) ≤ ˆT < ∞,

which contradicts the ﬁrst equality in (7.60). So W2,4 ∪ W3,3 is empty. Thus, we have
proved the ﬁrst equality in (7.59).

Finally, we prove the second equality in (7.59). On one hand, by the deﬁnitions of V1
(see (1.34)), we ﬁnd from (7.61) that V1 is empty. On the other hand, by contradiction,

109

suppose that V2,1 ∪ V3,1 were not empty. Then there would be a pair ( ˆM , ˆy0) ∈ V2,1 ∪ V3,1.
So by the deﬁnitions of V2,1 ∪ V3,1 (see (1.35) and (1.37)), it follows that

0 < ˆM ≤ N2(T 1(ˆy0), ˆy0),

which contradicts the second equality in (7.60). Therefore, V2,1 ∪ V3,1 is empty. Thus, we
have proved the second equality in (7.59).

In summary, we end the proof of this theorem.

We end this subsection with presenting such phenomenon that for some pairs (A2, B2),
the corresponding function T 0(·) (given by (1.19) with (A, B) being replaced by (A2, B2))
has the following property: T 0(y0) ∈ (0, ∞) for some y0 ∈ X. To see it, some preliminaries
are needed. First we notice that the operator A2 depends on the choices of {φj}j≥1,
{ψj}j≥1 and Λ; the operator B2 can be arbitrarily taken from L(U, X−1) \ {0}. For each
pair (A2, B2), we deﬁne

T2(A2, B2) , inf{T ∈ (0, ∞) : (A2, B2) has the L2-null controllability at T }. (7.62)

(By the L2-null controllability at T for (A2, B2), we mean that for each y0 ∈ X, there is
a control v ∈ L2(0, T ; U) so that ˆy2(T ; y0, v) = 0.) Sometimes, we will use T2 to denote
T2(A2, B2), if there is no risk causing any confusion. It is proved in [15] and [17] that
T2 ∈ (0, ∞) for some pairs (A2, B2). One such example (taken from [17]) is as follows:

Example 7.10. Consider the following controlled system

∂ty − ∂xxy = δx0v
y(0, ·) = y(π, ·) = 0 in (0, ∞),
y(·, 0) ∈ L2(0, π).

in (0, π) × (0, ∞),



One can directly check that this example can be put into the framework (A2, B2). Ac-
cording to Corollary 6.4 and Theorem 6.5 in [17], there are many x0 ∈ (0, π) so that the
corresponding T2 ∈ (0, ∞).

In the current paper, controls are taken from L∞ spaces. Thus, we deﬁne for each pair
(A2, B2),

T∞(A2, B2) , inf{T ∈ (0, ∞) : (A2, B2) has the L∞-null controllability at T }. (7.63)

Also, we simply use T∞ to denote T∞(A2, B2), if there is no risk to cause any confusion.

Lemma 7.11. For each pair (A2, B2), the corresponding T2 and T∞ (deﬁned by (7.62)
and (7.63), respectively) are the same.

110

Proof. It suﬃces to show that

(7.64)
By contradiction, suppose that it was not true. Then there would be two numbers ˆt and
ˆt′ so that

T∞ ≤ T2.

T2 < ˆt < ˆt′ < T∞.

(7.65)

Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X. According to the deﬁnition of T2, there exists a control u ∈
L2(0, ˆt; U) so that

ˆy2(ˆt; y0, u) = 0.

(7.66)

(A2, B2) satisﬁes the condition (H1) with p0 = 2. Thus, we apply (H1), where p0 = 2

Write eu for the zero extension of u over (0, ˆt′). According to Proposition 7.7, the pair
and T = ˆt′ and t = ˆt, to ﬁnd a control vu ∈ L∞(0, ˆt′; U) so that ˆy2(ˆt′; 0,eu) = ˆy2(ˆt′; 0, vu),

which implies that

This, along with (7.66), yields that

ˆy2(ˆt′; y0,eu) = ˆy2(ˆt′; y0, 0) + ˆy2(ˆt′; 0,eu) = ˆy2(ˆt′; y0, vu).

ˆy2(ˆt′; y0, vu) = S2(ˆt′ − ˆt)ˆy2(ˆt; y0, u) = 0.

Since y0 was arbitrarily taken from X, the above implies that the pair (A2, B2) has L∞-
null controllability at time ˆt′. By this and the deﬁnition of T∞, we deduce that T∞ ≤ ˆt′,
which contradicts (7.65). So (7.64) holds. We end the proof of this lemma.

Remark 7.12. There are systems (under the framework (A2, B2)) so that 0 < T∞ < ∞
(see Example 7.10 and Lemma 7.11). With the aid of this, we can prove that for some pair
(A2, B2), the corresponding function T 0(·), deﬁned by (1.19), satisﬁes that T 0(y0) ∈ (0, ∞)
for some y0 ∈ X.

Here is the argument: Suppose that for some (A2, B2),

0 < T∞(A2, B2) = T∞ < ∞.

(7.67)

On one hand, by the ﬁrst inequality in (7.67) and the deﬁnition of T∞, we can ﬁnd
T ∈ (0, T∞) so that the pair (A2, B2) is not L∞-null controllable. Thus there is ˆy0 ∈ X
so that for any v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U), ˆy2(T ; ˆy0, v) 6= 0. Then by the deﬁnition of T 0(ˆy0) (see
(1.19)), we see that T ≤ T 0(ˆy0), which leads to that T 0(ˆy0) > 0.

On the other hand, by the last inequality in (7.67) and the deﬁnition of T∞, we can
ﬁnd ˆT ∈ (T∞, ∞) so that the pair (A2, B2) is the L∞-null controllable at ˆT . Thus, for
each y0 ∈ X there is a control v ∈ L∞(0, ˆT ; U) so that ˆy( ˆT ; y0, v) = 0. This, along with
the deﬁnition of T 0(y0) (see (1.19)), yields that T0(y0) ≤ ˆT < ∞ for all y0 ∈ X.

In summary, we conclude that T 0(ˆy0) ∈ (0, ∞).

8 Appendix

8.1 Appendix A

In Appendix A, we will use the Kalman controllability decomposition to prove the follow-
ing Proposition:

Proposition 8.1. For each pair of matrices (A, B) in Rn×n×(Rn×m\{0}) (with n, m ≥ 1),
the corresponding decompositions (P1) and (P2) (given by (1.8) and (1.11), respectively)
hold.

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx (A, B) ∈ Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0}). Let R be given by (1.10). Since
B 6= 0, we have that

p , dim R > 0 and R \ {0} 6= ∅.

(8.1)

We now recall the Kalman controllability decomposition of (A, B) (see, for instance,
Lemma 3.3.3 and Lemma 3.3.4 in [38]): There exist K ∈ GL(n), A1 ∈ Rp×p, A2 ∈
Rp×(n−p), A3 ∈ R(n−p)×(n−p) and B1 ∈ Rp×m so that

K −1AK =(cid:18) A1 A2

0 A3 (cid:19) and K −1B =(cid:18) B1
0 (cid:19) ,

where the pair (A1, B1) is controllable, which is equivalent to

rank (B1, A1B1, · · · , Ap

1B1) = p.

(8.2)

(8.3)

Notice that when p = n, the decomposition is trivial. In this case, A1 = A, B1 = B and
A2 and A3 are not there.

We organize the proof by two steps as follows:

Step 1. The proof of (P2)

For each z0 ∈ Rn \ {0} and T ∈ (0, ∞), we deﬁne an aﬃliated minimal norm control

problem:

(N P)T,z0

K

NK(T, z0) , inf{kvkL∞(0,T ;Rm)

: ˆz(T ; z0, v) = 0},

(8.4)

where ˆz(·; z0, v) is the solution to the equation:

z′(t) =(cid:18) A1 A2

0 A3 (cid:19) z(t) +(cid:18) B1

0 (cid:19) v(t), 0 < t ≤ T,

(8.5)



z(0) = z0.

By the invertibility of K, one can easily show that when z0 = K −1y0, the problems
(N P)T,y0 and (N P)T,z0
K (given by (1.4) and (8.4), respectively) are equivalent, i.e., either

112

they have the same minimal norm controls or both of them have no any admissible control.
From (1.10), (8.2) and (8.3), it follows that

R = span (B, AB, · · · , AnB) = span K(cid:18) B1, A1B1, · · · , An

0

1 B1

(cid:19) = K(eRp),

(8.6)

where the span of a matrix denotes the subspace generated by all columns of the matrix,

and eRp is the following subspace:
By (8.1), we see that eRp \ {0} 6= ∅. From the equivalence of (N P)T,y0 and (N P)T,z0

K (with
z0 = K −1y0), (8.6) and (1.11), we see that to prove (P2), it suﬃces to show the following
BBP decomposition for (N P)T,z0
K :

eRp ,(cid:8)(z1, z2, · · · , zn) ∈ Rn : zp+1 = · · · = zn = 0(cid:9).

(8.7)

(Q2)

To show the ﬁrst conclusion in (Q2), we let

• For each (T, z0) ∈ (0, ∞) × (eRp \ {0}), (N P)T,z0
• For each (T, z0) ∈ (0, ∞) × (Rn \eRp), (N P)T,z0
(T, z0) ∈ (0, ∞) × (eRp \ {0}).

K has the bang-bang property.
K has no admissible control.

(8.8)

Write z0,1 for the ﬁrst p components of z0. Since z0 ∈ eRp, it follows that z0 = (z0,1, 0), if

p < n; and z0 = z0,1, if p = n. Thus, for each v ∈ L∞(0, T ; Rm), the solution ˆz(·; z0, v) of
the equation (8.5) satisﬁes that

ˆz(t; z0, v) =(cid:26) (cid:0)ˆz1(t; z0,1, v), 0(cid:1) for all t ∈ [0, T ], when p < n,

ˆz1(t; z0,1, v) for all t ∈ [0, T ], when p = n,

where ˆz1(·; z0,1, v) solves the following equation:

z′
1(t) = A1z1(t) + B1v(t), 0 < t ≤ T ; z1(0) = z0,1.

This, along with the controllability of (A1, B1) (which follows from (8.3), see, for instance,
Theorem 3 on Page 89 in [38]), indicates that (N P)T,z0
K has an admissible control. Then
by a standard way (see for instance [7, Lemma 1.1]), we can deduce that (N P)T,z0
K has a
minimal norm control.

Meanwhile, according to the Pontryagin maximum principle for (N P)T,z0

(see, for
instance, [6, Theorem 1.1.1]), there is η1 in Rp \ {0} so that each minimal norm control

is empty. Thus, we can assume, without loss of generality, that p < n. Arbitrarily ﬁx

has measure zero. From this and (8.9), we see that (N P)T,z0
So the ﬁrst conclusion in (Q2) is true.

1(T −t)η1 = 0(cid:9)
is real analytic over R, it follows from (8.3) that the set(cid:8)t ∈ (0, T ) : B∗
To verify the second conclusion in (Q2), we ﬁrst notice that when p = n, Rn \eRp
(T, z0) ∈ (0, ∞) × (Rn \eRp). Then from the equation (8.5), we see that any control v

has no any inﬂuence to the last (n − p) components of the solution ˆz(·; z0, v). Thus, for
each control v in L∞(0, T ; Rm), the solution ˆz(·; z0, v) of the equation (8.5) satisﬁes that
ˆz(T ; z0, v) 6= 0. Hence, (N P)T,z0
K has no any admissible control. This proves the second
conclusion in (Q2). Hence, the decomposition (Q2) holds. Consequently, (P2) is true.
Step 2. The proof of (P1)

For each z0 ∈ Rn \ {0} and M ∈ (0, ∞), we deﬁne an aﬃliated minimal time control

problem:

(T P)M,z0

K

TK(M, z0) , {ˆt > 0 : ∃ u ∈ UM s.t. z(ˆt; z0, u) = 0},

(8.11)



K

Two observations are given in order: First, by the invertibility of K, one can easily see
that the problems (T P)M,y0 and (T P)M,z0
(given by (1.1) and (8.10), respectively) are
equivalent, i.e., either they have the same minimal time controls or both of them have no
any admissible control. Second, from (1.4), one can easily check that when y0 ∈ R \ {0},
the function N (·, y0) has the properties: it is decreasing over (0, ∞); for each T ∈ (0, ∞),
N (T, y0) ∈ (0, ∞). Hence, for each y0 ∈ R \ {0}, limT →∞ N (T, y0) exists and is a ﬁnite
and non-negative number. Meanwhile, by the equivalence between (N P)T,y0 and (N P)T,z0
(with z0 = K −1y0), it follows that for each T > 0, N (T, y0) = NK(T, z0). These imply
that

N (T, y0) = lim

NK(T, z0) < ∞ when z0 = K −1y0 and y0 ∈ R \ {0}.

(8.12)

From the above-mentioned two observations, as well as (8.6) and (1.8), we ﬁnd that to
prove (P1), it suﬃces to show the following BBP decomposition for (T P)M,z0
K :

(Q1)

• For each (M, z0) ∈ DK

• For each (M, z0) ∈(cid:0)(0, ∞) × (Rn \ {0})(cid:1) \ DK

Before proving the decomposition (Q1), we observe that by the ﬁrst conclusion in (Q2),
we can use the same way used in the proof of [43, Proposition 4.4] to get the following

conclusion: When z0 ∈eRp \ {0},

(T P)M,z0

K

has a minimal time control ⇐⇒ ∞ > M > lim
T →∞

NK(T, z0).

(8.15)

To show the ﬁrst conclusion in (Q1), we let (M, z0) ∈ DK

bbp. Then, it follows from

(8.15) and (8.13) that (T P)M,z0

K

has at least one minimal time control.

when p < n; while z0 = z0,1 when p = n. Then by (8.11), we can easily check that

Write z0,1 for the ﬁrst p components of z0. Since z0 ∈eRp, it follows that z0 = (z0,1, 0)

z(t; z0, v) =(cid:26) (cid:0)z1(t; z0,1, u), 0(cid:1) for all t ≥ 0, when p < n,

z1(t; z0,1, u) for all t ≥ 0, when p = n,

where z1(·; z0,1, u) solves the following equation:

z′
1(t) = A1z1(t) + B1u(t), 0 < t < ∞, z1(0) = z0,1.

From this, we can use the Pontryagin maximum principle for (T P)M,z0
(see, for instance,
[6, Theorem 1.1.1]) to ﬁnd η2 ∈ Rp \ {0} so that each minimal time control u∗ to (T P)M,z0

(8.16), yields that (T P)M,z0

(M, z0) ∈(cid:0)(0, ∞) × (Rn \ {0})(cid:1) \ DK

(8.17)

Then, there are only two possibilities on the pair (M, z0) as follows: First, (M, z0) veriﬁes

that z0 ∈eRp \ {0} and 0 < M ≤ limT →∞ NK(T, z0); Second, (M, z0) ∈ (0, ∞) × (Rn \eRp).

In the ﬁrst case, it follows from (8.15) that (T P)M,z0
has no any admissible control. In
the second case, we have that p < n and the last (n − p) components of z0 are not all
zero. Then by (8.11), we ﬁnd that z(T ; z0, u) 6= 0 for all u ∈ L∞(R+; Rm) and T ∈ (0, ∞).
This implies that (T P)M,z0
has no any admissible control. Hence, the second conclusion
in (Q1) is also true. So the BBP decomposition (Q1) holds. Consequently, (P1) stands.
In summary, we end the proof of (P1) and (P2), through using the Kalman controlla-

bility decomposition.

8.2 Appendix B

In Appendix B, we will show that each pair of matrices (A, B) in Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0})
(with n, m ≥ 1) holds the properties (H1) and (H2).

Proposition 8.2. Any pair of matrices (A, B) ∈ Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0}) (with n, m ≥ 1)
satisﬁes (H1) (with p0 = 2) and (H2).

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx (A, B) ∈ Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0}). We organize the proof by two steps.
In Step 1, we show that (H1) (with p0 = 2) holds for the pair (A, B). For this purpose,
we will show that (A, B) satisﬁes the conclusion (iii) of Lemma 2.5 (with p2 = 2). When
the later is done, it follows from Lemma 2.5 that (H1) (with p0 = 2) holds for the pair
(A, B).

The remainder of this step is to show that (iii) of Lemma 2.5 (with p2 = 2) holds for

the pair (A, B). Arbitrarily ﬁx 0 < t < T < ∞. Deﬁne the following two spaces:

O1 , {B∗eA∗(T −·)z|(0,t) ∈ L2(0, t; Rm) : z ∈ Rn}, with the norm k · kL2(0,t;Rm),

and

O2 , {B∗eA∗(T −·)z|(t,T ) ∈ L1(t, T ; Rm) : z ∈ Rn}, with the norm k · kL1(t,T ;Rm).

It is clear that they are ﬁnitely dimensional spaces. Then deﬁne a map F : O2 → O1 by
setting

F(cid:0)B∗eA∗(T −·)z|(t,T )(cid:1) , B∗eA∗(T −·)z|(0,t)

for each z ∈ Rn.

(8.18)

By the analyticity of the function t 7→ B∗eA∗t, t ∈ R, one can easily check that the map
F is well deﬁned. It is clear that F is linear (from the ﬁnitely dimensional space O2 to

116

the ﬁnitely dimensional space O1). Thus, F is bounded. Then it follows by (8.18) that
there is a positive constant C(T, t) so that

kB∗eA∗(T −·)zkL2(0,t;Rm) ≤ C(T, t)kB∗eA∗(T −·)zkL1(t,T ;Rm) for each z ∈ Rn.

This, along with the deﬁnition of YT (see (1.22)), yields that

kgkL2(0,t;Rm) ≤ C(T, t)kgkL1(t,T ;Rm) for each g ∈ YT ,

which leads to the conclusion (iii) of Lemma 2.5 (with p2 = 2).

In Step 2, we will prove that (H2) holds for the pair (A, B). To this end, we ﬁrst show
that (H4) holds for the pair (A, B). In the ﬁnitely dimensional setting, we have that for
each z ∈ Rn and each T > 0, the function ]B∗S∗(T − ·)z (deﬁned by (1.25)) is the same as
B∗eA∗(T −·) over [0, T ]. From this and the analyticity of the function t 7→ B∗eA∗t, t ∈ R,
one can easily check that (H4) holds for the pair (A, B). Next, we claim that for each
T ∈ (0, ∞), the space XT (deﬁned by (1.23)) is the same as YT . In fact, it follows from
(1.23) that for each T > 0, XT is a ﬁnitely dimensional subspace in L1(0, T ; Rm). Thus,
for each T > 0, XT is closed in L1(0, T ; Rm). Then we ﬁnd from (1.22) that XT = YT
for all T ∈ (0, ∞). From this, it follows that the conditions (H4) and (H2) are the same.
Therefore, (H2) holds for the pair (A, B). This ends the proof of this proposition.

8.3 Appendix C

In Appendix C, we will explain that the BBP decompositions (P1) and (P2) (given by
(1.8) and (1.11), respectively) are consequences of Theorem 1.4 and Theorem 1.5. To see
these, we need one lemma. In the proof of this lemma, the following well known result
(see, for instance, [38, Section 3.3, Chapetr 3]) is used.

Lemma 8.3. Let (A, B) ∈ Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0}) (with n, m ≥ 1). Let RT and R0
T (with
T > 0) be given respectively by (1.44) and (1.45). Let R be given by (1.10). Deﬁne the
following subspace

CT , {y0 ∈ Rn : ∃ v ∈ L∞(0, T ; Rm) s.t. ˆy1(T ; y0, v) = 0}, T > 0,

(8.19)

where ˆy1(·; y0, v) denotes the solution of (1.5). Then it holds that

The following lemma concern some special properties on the functions T 0(·) and T 1(·)

(deﬁned respectively by (1.19) and (1.20)).

CT = bR = RT = R0

T for all T > 0.

117

Lemma 8.4. Let (A, B) ∈ Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0}). Let R be given by (1.10). Then the
functions T 0(·) and T 1(·) (deﬁned respectively by (1.19) and (1.20)) have the following
properties:
(i) For each y0 ∈ R, T 0(y0) = 0, while for each y0 ∈ Rn \ R, T 0(y0) = ∞.
(ii) For each y0 ∈ Rn \ {0}, N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞.
(iii) For each y0 ∈ Rn \ {0}, T 1(y0) = ∞.
(iv) For each y0 ∈ R \ {0}, N(T 1(y0), y0) < ∞.

Proof. (i) We ﬁrst prove that T 0(y0) = 0 for each y0 ∈ R. Arbitrarily ﬁx y0 ∈ R and
ˆt ∈ (0, ∞). According to Lemma 8.3, there is v ∈ L∞(0, ˆt; Rm) so that ˆy1(ˆt; y0, v) = 0
From this and the deﬁnition of T 0(y0) (see (1.19)), we deduce that T 0(y0) ≤ ˆt. Since ˆt
was arbitrarily taken from (0, ∞), it follows that T 0(y0) = 0.

Next, we verify that T 0(y0) = ∞ for each y0 ∈ Rn \ R. By contradiction, suppose that
T 0(ˆy0) < ∞ for some ˆy0 ∈ Rn \ R. Then from the deﬁnition of T 0(ˆy0) (see (1.19)), there

would be ˆt′ ∈(cid:0)T 0(ˆy0), ∞(cid:1) and ˆv ∈ L∞(0, ˆt′; Rm) so that ˆy1(ˆt′; ˆy0, ˆv) = 0. This, along with

the deﬁnition of Cˆt′ (given by (8.19) with T = ˆt′), implies that ˆy0 ∈ Cˆt′. Then by Lemma
8.3, we ﬁnd that ˆy0 ∈ R, which contradicts the assumption that ˆy0 ∈ Rn \ R. This ends
the proof of the conclusion (i).

(ii) Let y0 ∈ Rn \ {0}. There are only two possibilities on y0: either y0 ∈ R \ {0} or
y0 ∈ Rn \ R. In the case that y0 ∈ R \ {0}, we see from (i) of this lemma that T 0(y0) = 0.
Then by (iv) of Lemma 3.3, we have that N(T 0(y0), y0) = N(0, y0) = ∞. In the case that
y0 ∈ Rn \ R, we ﬁnd from (i) of this lemma that T 0(y0) = ∞. Then by (ii) of Lemma 3.4,
it follows that N(T 0(y0), y0) = ∞.

(iii) Let y0 ∈ Rn \ {0}. Since {eAt}t∈R+ has the backward uniqueness property, we ﬁnd

from the deﬁnition of T 1(y0) (see (1.20)) that the conclusion (iii) holds.

(iv) Let y0 ∈ R \ {0}. Then it follows by the conclusion (i) of this lemma that

T 0(y0) = 0. This, along with (v) of Lemma 3.4, yields that N(T 1(y0), y0) < ∞.

In summary, we ﬁnish the proof of this lemma.

Proposition 8.5. For each pair (A, B) in Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0}) (with n, m ≥ 1), the
BBP decompositions (P1) and (P2) (given respectively by (1.8) and (1.11)), are the con-
sequences of Theorem 1.4 and Theorem 1.5 respectively.

Proof. Arbitrarily ﬁx a pair (A, B) in Rn×n × (Rn×m \ {0}). By Proposition 8.2, (A, B)
satisﬁes (H1) and (H2). Then all conclusions in Theorem 1.4 and Theorem 1.5 hold. By
(i)-(iii) of Lemma 8.4, (vi) of Lemma 3.3, the ﬁrst conclusion in Theorem 1.4 and the ﬁrst
conclusion in Theorem 1.5, we can easily check that

W = W3,2 ∪ W3,4, V = V3,1 ∪ V3,2 ∪ V3,3;

118

W3,2 = R \ {0}, W3,4 = Rn \ R, V3,2 = Dbbp, V3,1 ∪ V3,3 = X1 \ Dbbp.

(Here, R, Dbbp and X1 are respectively given by (1.10), (1.9) and (1.6)). These, along
with the conclusions (iii) and (iv) in Theorem 1.4 and the conclusions (ii) and (v) in
Theorem 1.5, yields that the BBP decompositions (P1) and (P2) holds for the pair (A, B).
This ends the proof.

8.4 Appendix D

In Appendix D, we provide the proofs of Proposition 2.1 and Lemma 2.2, respectively.

Proof of Proposition 2.1. Arbitrarily ﬁx T ∈ (0, ∞), v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) and z ∈ D(A∗).
Since X−1 is the dual of D(A∗) with respect to the pivot space X, we have that

Because S−1(T − ·)Bv(·) ∈ L1(0, T ; X−1), we have that

0

S−1(T − t)Bv(t) dt, z(cid:11)X =(cid:10)Z T
(cid:10)Z T
(cid:10)Z T
S−1(T − t)Bv(t) dt, z(cid:11)X−1,D(A∗) =Z T

We next claim that

S−1(T − t)Bv(t) dt, z(cid:11)X−1,D(A∗).

(8.21)

0

(S−1)∗(T − t)z = S∗(T − t)z in D(A∗),

for all t ∈ [0, T ].

(8.22)

Indeed, since {S−1(t)}t∈R+ is the extension of {S(t)}t∈R+ on X−1, and because X−1 is the
dual of D(A∗) with respect to the pivot space X , we ﬁnd that for each s ≥ 0 and w ∈ X,

hS∗

−1(s)z, wiD(A∗),X−1 = hz, S−1(s)wiD(A∗),X−1 = hz, S(s)wiD(A∗),X−1

= hz, S(s)wiX = hS∗(s)z, wiX = hS∗(s)z, wiD(A∗),X−1.

Since X is dense in X−1, the above implies that for all s ≥ 0 and ˆw ∈ X−1,

hS∗

−1(s)z, ˆwiD(A∗),X−1 = hS∗(s)z, ˆwiD(A∗),X−1.

This leads to (8.22). From (8.22), we ﬁnd that

Z T

0

hS−1(T − t)Bv(t), ziX−1,D(A∗) dt =Z T

0

hv(t), B∗S∗(T − t)ziX−1,D(A∗) dt.

(8.23)

Now, (2.1) follows from (8.20), (8.21) and (8.23) immediately. This ends the proof of

Proposition 2.1.

119

Proof of Lemma 2.2. Arbitrarily ﬁx 0 < T < ∞ and z ∈ D(A∗). Then it follows from
(2.1) that

which, along with (1.12), leads to (2.2). This ends the proof of Lemma 2.2.

8.5 Appendix E

In Appendix E, we give the proof of Lemma 3.1.

Proof of Lemma 3.1. Suppose that (3.1) holds for some {Tn}∞
n=1
and ˆu in L2(R+; U). Arbitrarily ﬁx a y0 ∈ X. We will prove (3.2) by two steps as follows.
Step 1. To show that there is a positive constant C so that

n=1, bT in [0, ∞), some {un}∞

ky(Tn; y0, un)kX ≤ C for all n

(8.24)

We ﬁrst claim that there is a positive constant C1 so that for each s ∈ (0,bT + 1) and

each us ∈ L2(0, s; U),

(8.25)

0

(cid:13)(cid:13)Z s
vus,s(t) =( 0,

S−1(s − τ )Bus(τ ) dτ(cid:13)(cid:13)X ≤ C1kuskL2(0,s;U ).
To this end, we arbitrarily ﬁx s ∈ (0,bT + 1) and us ∈ L2(0, s; U). Let
t ∈ (0,bT + 1 − s],
t ∈ (bT + 1 − s,bT + 1).

Then, we have that kvus,skL2(0, bT +1;U ) = kuskL2(0,s;U ) and

us(t + s − bT − 1),

These, along with (1.12), yield that

0

Z bT +1
S−1(bT + 1 − τ )Bvus,s(τ ) dτ =Z s
(cid:13)(cid:13)Z s
S−1(s − τ )Bus(τ ) dτ(cid:13)(cid:13)X = (cid:13)(cid:13)Z bT +1

S−1(s − τ )Bus(τ ) dτ.

S−1(bT + 1 − τ )Bvus,s(τ ) dτ(cid:13)(cid:13)X

120

where C1 , C1(bT + 1) is given by (1.12). Hence, (8.25) is true.

Next, it follows from (1.16) that

y(Tn; y0, un) = S(Tn)y0 +Z Tn

0

S−1(Tn − t)Bun(t) dt for all n ∈ N+.

(8.26)

Because of the ﬁrst convergence in (3.1), we can assume, without loss of generality, that

ψz

(8.27)

0≤t≤ bT +1

Step 2. To show (3.2)

the following manners:

ky(Tn; y0, un)kX ≤ sup

kS(t)kL(X,X)ky0kX + C1kunkL2(0,Tn;U ) for all n.

Tn ≤ bT + 1 for all n. This, along with (8.25) and (8.26), yields that
Meanwhile, it follows from the second convergence in (3.1) that there is a bC > 0 so that
kunkL2(R+;U ) ≤ bC for all n, which, along with (8.27), implies (8.24).
n(·) and bψz(·) over (−1,bT + 1) in

Arbitrarily ﬁx a z ∈ D(A∗). Deﬁne two functions ψz

n(t) , B∗S∗(Tn − t)z for all t ∈ (−1, Tn];

n(t) , 0 for all t ∈ (Tn,bT + 1) and ψz
bψz(t) , 0 for all t ∈ (bT ,bT + 1) and bψz(t) , B∗S∗(bT − t)z for all t ∈ (−1,bT ].
We claim that for a.e. t ∈ (−1,bT + 1),
In fact, by the ﬁrst convergence in (3.1), we see that for each t ∈ (bT ,bT + 1), there
is N1(t) ≥ 1 so that t ∈ (Tn,bT + 1) for all n ≥ N1(t). Thus, we see that for each
t ∈ (bT ,bT + 1),
Meanwhile, given t ∈ (−1,bT ), there is N2(t) ≥ 1 so that t ∈ (−1, Tn) for all n ≥ N2(t).

n(t) − bψz(t) = 0 for all n ≥ N1(t).

n(t) = bψz(t) in U.

This yields that for each n ≥ N2(t),

lim
n→∞

(8.29)

(8.28)

n(t) − bψz(t)kU ≤ kB∗kL(D(A∗),U )(cid:16)kS∗(Tn − t)z − S∗(bT − t)zkX

+kS∗(Tn − t)A∗z − S∗(bT − t)A∗zkX(cid:17).

(Here, we used that B∗ ∈ L(D(A∗), U).) Since {S∗(t)}t∈R+ is a C0-semigroup in X, it

follows from (8.30) that for each t ∈ (−1,bT ), ψz

with (8.29), leads to (8.28).

n(t) → bψz(t) in U, as n → ∞. This, along

(8.30)

ψz

ψz

121

Next, since B∗ ∈ L(D(A∗), U) and 0 ≤ Tn ≤ bT + 1, n ∈ N+, one can easily check that
for all n ∈ N+ and t ∈ (−1,bT + 1),

n(t)kU ≤ kB∗kL(D(A∗),U ) max

kS∗(s)kL(X,X)kzkD(A∗).

(8.31)

kψz

0≤s≤ bT +2

By (8.28) and (8.31), we can use the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem to get
that ψz
each z ∈ D(A∗),

n → bψz in L2(−1,bT + 1; U), as n → ∞. This, along with (1.15), yields that for

hy(Tn; y0, un), ziX → hy(bT ; y0, ˆu), ziX , as n → ∞.

Since D(A∗) is dense in X, (3.2) follows from (8.32) at once. This ends the proof of
Lemma 3.1.

(8.32)

8.6 Appendix F

In Appendix F, we provide the proof of Proposition 6.4.

Proof of Proposition 6.4 . We divide the proof into the following several steps.

Step 1. To show that (i)⇒(ii)

Suppose that (i) holds. Let T ∈ (0, ∞) and let C1(T ) be given by (6.70). Arbitrarily
ﬁx y0 ∈ X. Deﬁne a map FT,y0 : XT → R (where XT is given by (1.23)) in the following
manner:

FT,y0(cid:0)B∗S∗(T − ·)z|(0,T )(cid:1) = hy0, S∗(T )ziX for each z ∈ D(A∗).

We ﬁrst claim that FT,y0 is well deﬁned. In fact, if

(8.33)

z1, z2 ∈ D(A∗) s.t. B∗S∗(T − ·)z1 = B∗S∗(T − ·)z2 over (0, T ),

then by (6.70), it follows that S∗(T )z1 = S∗(T )z2 in X. Hence, FT,y0 is well deﬁned.
Besides, one can easily check that FT,y0 is linear. By (6.70), we can also ﬁnd that

(cid:12)(cid:12)FT,y0(cid:0)B∗S∗(T − ·)z|(0,T )(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C1(T )ky0kXkB∗S∗(T − ·)zkL1(0,T ;U ) for all z ∈ D(A∗).

From this, we see that

kFT,y0kL(XT ,R) ≤ C1(T )ky0kX.

(8.34)

Since XT is a subspace of L1(0, T ; U) (see (1.22)), we can apply the Hahn-Banach theorem

to ﬁnd a functional eFT,y0 ∈ (L1(0, T ; U))∗ so that

kFT,y0kL(XT ,R) = keFT,y0k(L1(0,T ;U ))∗ and FT,y0(g) = eFT,y0(g) for all g ∈ XT .

122

From these, we can apply the Riesz representation theorem to ﬁnd a function v ∈
L∞(0, T ; U) so that

and so that

kFT,y0kL(XT ,R) = kvkL∞(0,T ;U )

FT,y0(g) =Z T

0

hg(t), v(t)iU dt for all g ∈ XT .

(8.35)

(8.36)

From (8.33), (8.36), (1.23) and (2.1) in Proposition 2.1, we see that for each z ∈ D(A∗),

hS(T )y0, ziX = FT,y0(cid:0)B∗S∗(T − ·)z|(0,T )(cid:1) =Z T
S−1(T − t)Bv(t) dt, z(cid:11)X.

= (cid:10)Z T

0

hv(t), B∗S∗(T − t)z(cid:11)U dt

0

This, along with (1.16), indicates that hˆy(T ; y0, −v), ziX = 0 for all z ∈ D(A∗). Since
D(A∗) is dense in X, the above leads to that ˆy(T ; y0, −v) = 0. Meanwhile, it follows from
(8.35) and (8.34) that kvkL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ C1(T )ky0kX . From these, (6.71) (with C2(T ) =
C1(T )) follows at once.

Step 2. To prove that (ii)⇒(i)

Suppose that (ii) holds. Let T ∈ (0, ∞) and let C2(T ) be given by (ii). Arbitrarily ﬁx

y0 ∈ X. By (ii), there is v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) so that

ˆy(T ; y0, v) = 0 and kvkL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ C2(T )ky0kX.

(8.37)

By the ﬁrst equality in (8.37) and (1.15), we ﬁnd that

hy0, S∗(T )ziX = −Z T

0

hv(t), B∗S∗(T − t)ziU dt for all z ∈ D(A∗).

This, along with the second inequality in (8.37), yields that

hy0, S∗(T )ziX ≤ C2(T )ky0kXkB∗S∗(T − ·)zkL1(0,T ;U ) for all z ∈ D(A∗).

Since y0 was arbitrarily taken from X, the above implies that

kS∗(T )zkX = sup

y0∈X\{0}

hy0, S∗(T )ziX

ky0kX

≤ C2(T )kB∗S∗(T − ·)zkL1(0,T ;U ) for all z ∈ D(A∗),

which leads to (6.70) with C1(T ) = C2(T ).

Step 3. To show that (ii)⇔(iii)

123

It is clear that (ii)⇒(iii). We now show the reverse. Suppose that (iii) holds. Let

T ∈ (0, ∞). Deﬁne a linear operator GT : L∞(0, T ; U) → X by setting

GT (v) =Z T

0

S−1(T − t)Bv(t) dt for each v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U).

(8.38)

Then it follows from (1.12) that GT is bounded. By (iii), we know that for each y0 ∈ X,
there is v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) so that ˆy(T ; y0, v) = 0. This, along with (1.16), yields that

0 = S(T )y0 +Z T

0

S−1(T − t)Bv(t) dt.

From (8.38) and (8.39), we see that

Range S(T ) ⊂ Range GT .

(8.39)

(8.40)

Write QT for the quotient space of L∞(0, T ; U) with respect to Ker GT , i.e.,

QT , L∞(0, T ; U)/Ker GT .

Let πT : L∞(0, T ; U) → QT be the quotient map. Then πT is surjective and it holds that

kπT (v)kQT = inf(cid:8)kwkL∞(0,T ;U )

: w ∈ v + Ker GT(cid:9) for each v ∈ L∞(0, T ; U).

Deﬁne a map ˆGT : QT → X in the following manner:

ˆGT (πT (v)) = GT (v) for each πT (v) ∈ QT .

(8.41)

(8.42)

One can easily check that ˆGT is linear and bounded. By (8.42) and (8.40), we see that ˆGT
is injective and that

Range S(T ) ⊂ Range ˆGT .

From these, we ﬁnd that given y0 ∈ X, there is a unique πT (vy0) ∈ QT so that

We next deﬁne another map TT : X → QT by

S(T )y0 = ˆGT(cid:0)πT (vy0)(cid:1).

TT (y0) = πT (vy0) for each y0 ∈ X.

(8.43)

(8.44)

One can easily check that TT is well deﬁned and linear. We will use the closed graph
theorem to show that TT is bounded. For this purpose, we let {yn} ⊂ X satisfy that

yn → ˆy in X and TT (yn) → ˆh in QT , as n → ∞.

(8.45)

124

Because ˆGT and S(T ) are linear and bounded, it follows from (8.45), (8.44) and (8.43)
that

ˆGT (ˆh) = lim
n→∞

S(T )yn = S(T )ˆy.

(8.46)

ˆGT(cid:0)TT (yn)(cid:1) = lim

n→∞

ˆGT(cid:0)πT (vyn)(cid:1) = lim

n→∞

Meanwhile, by (8.43) and (8.44), we ﬁnd that S(T )ˆy = ˆGT(cid:0)πT (vˆy)(cid:1) = ˆGT(cid:0)TT (ˆy)(cid:1). This,
together with (8.46), yields that ˆGT (ˆh) = ˆGT(cid:0)TT (ˆy)(cid:1), which, together with the injectivity

of ˆGT , indicates that ˆh = TT (ˆy). So the graph of TT is closed. Now we can apply the
closed graph theorem to see that TT is bounded. Hence, there is a constant C(T ) > 0 so
that kTT (y0)kQT ≤ C(T )ky0kX for all y0 ∈ X. This, along with (8.44), indicates that

kπT (vy0)kQT ≤ C(T )ky0kX for each y0 ∈ X.

Meanwhile, by (8.41), we see that for each y0 ∈ X, there is v′

y0 so that

v′
y0 ∈ vy0 + Ker GT and kv′

y0kL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ 2kπT (vy0)kQT .

(8.47)

(8.48)

From (8.43), (8.42), (8.48) and (8.47) , we ﬁnd that for each y0 ∈ X, there is a control

v′
y0 ∈ L∞(0, T ; U) so that

S(T )y0 = GT (v′

y0) and kv′

y0kL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ 2C(T )ky0kX.

(8.49)

Then by (1.16), (8.38) and (8.49), we see that for each y0 ∈ X, there is a control v′
L∞(0, T ; U) so that

y0 ∈

ˆy(T ; y0, −v′

y0) = 0 and kv′

y0kL∞(0,T ;U ) ≤ 2C(T )ky0kX.

These lead to (6.71) with C2(T ) = 2C(T ).

Step 4. About the constants C1(T ) and C2(T )

From the proofs in Step 1-Step 3, we ﬁnd that the constants C1(T ) in (6.70) and C2(T )
in (6.71) can be taken as the same number, provided that one of the conclusions (i)-(iii)
holds.

In summary, we end the proof of this proposition.

8.7 Appendix G

In Appendix G, we provide the proof of Lemma 7.4.

(8.51)

(Notice that in [17], λj was a complex number, while in the current case, we take it as a
real number. So λj = λj in the current case. To avoid the inconformity, we still use the
notation λj.) Since W (λk) = 0 for each k ≥ 1, and because of (7.14) and (8.50), we can
select a subsequence from {rn}∞
n=1 (denoted in the same manner,) having two properties
as follows: First, {λj}∞
n=1 = ∅. Second, for each n ∈ N+, the set

j=1T{rn}∞

Gn , {z = reiθ

: rn < |z| < rn+1, |θ| < θ0}

contains at least an element of Λ , {λj}∞
W (·), as well as their properties, will be used later.

j=1. The sequence {Gn}n≥1 and the function

Let J be a function deﬁned by

J(λ) =

W (λ)
(1 + λ)2 , λ ∈ C+.

For each j ≥ 1, deﬁne a function Jj by

Jj(λ) =

J(λ)

J ′(λj)(λ − λj)

, λ ∈ C+.

(8.52)

(8.53)

According to [17, Theorem 4.1] (see also the proof of [17, Theorem 4.1]), there exists a
biorthogonal family {qj}j≥1 to {e−λjt} in L2(R+; C) so that the Laplace transform of ¯qj
is Jj for each j ∈ N+.

To prove the desired inequality (7.22), we will build up two inequalities for p ∈ P.

The ﬁrst one reads: For each ε > 0, there is C(θ0, ε) > 0 so that for each p ∈ P,

|p(z)| ≤ C(θ0, ε)e− 1

8 |λ1| cos θ0Re zkpkL1(R+;C) for all z ∈ Sε,θ0,

(8.54)

where Sε,θ0 is given by (7.21). The second one reads: For each T ∈ (0, ∞), there exists
C , C(T ) > 0 so that

kpkL1(R+;C) ≤ CkpkL1(0,T ;C) for all p ∈ P.

(8.55)

126

We now show (8.54). Let p ∈ P. By (7.20), we can express p in the following manner:

p(z) =

NXj=1

cje−λj z, z ∈ C+, with N ∈ N+ and {cj}N

j=1 ⊂ C.

(8.56)

Since each {Gn}n≥1 contains at least an element of Λ , {λj}∞
m , m(N) ∈ N+ so that {λj}N

k=1 Gk. This, along with (8.56), yields that

j=1 and λj ր ∞, there is an

j=1 ⊂Sm
mXk=1 Xλj∈Gk

p(z) =

cje−λjz ,

gk(z), z ∈ C+.

(8.57)

mXk=1

Meanwhile, since {qj}∞
(8.56) that

j=1 is a biorthogonal family to {e−λjt} in L2(R+; C), it follows from

From this and (8.57), we have that for each k ∈ {1, · · · , m},

cj =Z ∞
gk(z) =Z ∞

p(t)qj(t) dt, with 1 ≤ j ≤ N.

p(t)(cid:16) Xλj∈Gk

qj(t)e−λj z(cid:17) dt, z ∈ C+.

This yields that for each k ∈ {1, · · · , m} and each z ∈ C+,

|gk(z)| ≤ kp(·)kL1(R+;C)kGk(·, z)kL∞(R+;C).

where

Gk(t, z) , Xλj ∈Gk

qj(t)e−λj z,

t ∈ R+.

(8.58)

(8.59)

Arbitrarily ﬁx a k ∈ {1, · · · , m}. Since for each j ∈ N+, the Laplace transform of ¯qj is
Jj, we see that for each z ∈ C+, the Laplace transform of Gk(t, z) is given by

Z ∞

0

Gk(t, z)e−λt dt = Xλj∈Gk

Jj(λ)e−λjz, λ ∈ C+,

(8.60)

Since qj(t) = 0 for all t < 0 and j ∈ N+, we see from (8.59) that for each z ∈ C+,
Gk(t, z) = 0 for all t < 0. This, along with (8.60), yields that for each z ∈ C+, the

127

function τ →Pλj∈Gk

inverse Fourier transform, we see that for each z ∈ C+,

Jj(iτ )e−λj z, τ ∈ R, is the Fourier transform of Gk(·, z). Then by the

Meanwhile, by (8.52), (8.51) and (7.20), we ﬁnd that each λj is a simple root of J. Thus,

Starting from (8.64), using the same way as that used in the proof of estimating (4.12) in
[17, Lemma 4.6] (see [17, Pages 2113-2115]), we can get the inequality (8.54).

Now we prove the second inequality (8.55). By contradiction, suppose that it were

not true. Then there would be a T > 0 and a sequence {pn}∞

n=1 ⊂ P so that

kpnkL1(R+;C) = 1 and kpnkL1(0,T ;C) < 1/n for each n ≥ 1.

Arbitrarily ﬁx ε0 ∈ (0, T /2). Then choose a s0 ∈ (T, ∞) so that

where C(θ0, ε0) is given by (8.54). From (8.54), we ﬁnd that for all m, n ∈ N+,

This, along with (8.66), implies that for all m, n ∈ N+,

(8.67)

Two observations are given in order: First, by (8.54) and the ﬁrst equality in (8.65), we
ﬁnd that {kpnkC(Sε0 ,θ0 ,C)}∞
n=1 is bounded. Second, each pn (with n ∈ N+) is analytic over
Sε0,θ0. From these observations, we can use the Montel theorem to ﬁnd a subsequence
{pnk}∞

n=1 and an analytic function ˆp over Sε0,θ0 so that

k=1 of {pn}∞

pnk → ˆp uniformly on each compact set of Sε0,θ0, as k → ∞.

(8.68)

Since 0 < 2ε0 < T < s0, it follows from (8.68) and the second inequality in (8.65) that

pnk → 0 in L1(0, T ; C) and pnk → ˆp in L1(T, s0; C), as k → ∞.

These, along with (8.67), (8.68) and the ﬁrst equality in (8.65), indicates that

kˆpkL1(T,∞;C) = 1 and kˆpkL1(2ε0,T ;C) = 0.

(8.69)

Since ˆp is analytic over Sε0,θ0, from the second assertion in (8.69), we get that ˆp ≡ 0 over
Sε0,θ0. This contradicts the ﬁrst assertion in (8.69). So (8.55) is true.

Finally, the desired inequality (7.22) follows from (8.54) and (8.55) at once. This ends

the proof of Lemma 7.4.
