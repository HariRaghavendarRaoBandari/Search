Abstract

We investigate wave mixing eﬀects in a phononic crystal that couples the wave

dynamics of two channels – primary and control ones – via a variable stiﬀness

mechanism. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the wave trans-

mission in the primary channel can be manipulated by the control channel’s

signal. We show that the application of control waves allows the selection of

a speciﬁc mode through the primary channel. We also demonstrate that the

mixing of two wave modes is possible whereby a modulation eﬀect is observed.

A detailed study of the design parameters is also carried out to optimize the

switching capabilities of the proposed system. Finally, we verify that the system

can fulﬁll both switching and ampliﬁcation functionalities, potentially enabling

the realization of an acoustic transistor.

1. Introduction

Phononic crystals (PCs) are deﬁned as periodic elastic lattices that can trans-

mit or block a selected range of mechanical vibrations (i.e., phonons) [1, 2, 3,

4, 5, 6]. Wave propagation in PCs has been a subject of intense study for

the past several years [7, 8, 9, 10]. Particularly, the controllability and tun-

ability of PCs has gained signiﬁcant interest given the potential of acoustic

devices that are counterparts of electrical/optical ﬂow control devices [11, 12].

For example, researchers have shown controllable vibration mitigation and wave

attenuation in PCs by tuning their local resonances [5, 13, 14]. Such locally-

resonant PCs are often called acoustic/mechanical metamaterials. Recent stud-

ies have also demonstrated the feasibility of wave manipulation [12, 15, 16],

mixing [17, 18, 19], and energy localization [16, 20, 21, 22] by leveraging the

tunable properties of PCs.

Many studies have focused on the investigation of tunable wave propagation

in PCs in a static manner (e.g., by changing mass [23], stiﬀness [18, 24], and

other pre-determined mechanical properties [25]). The more challenging prob-

lem is to manipulate wave propagation in situ in a dynamical manner. Only a

limited number of studies have been conducted to explore the dynamic control of

wave modes in the realm of PCs. Vakakis et al. investigated the coupling inter-

actions of mechanical waves in nonlinear lattices via a targeted energy transfer

concept [16, 20]. Also, wave mixing eﬀects have been explored in the settings of

birefringent phononic crystals [26], granular wave guides [27], and anharmonic

oscillator ladders [28]. In the majority of these systems, lattices (or particles)

are interconnected with each other via ﬁxed linear or nonlinear springs without

considering the possibility of varying the systems’ stiﬀness. Variable stiﬀness

may oﬀer an enhanced degree of freedom in manipulating mechanical waves.

Traditionally, variable stiﬀness mechanisms have been widely used for engi-

neering applications, such as vibration isolation systems (VIS) [29, 30], robotics

[31, 32], and rehabilitation devices [33]. Only recently have researchers adopted

2

variable stiﬀness mechanisms for the manipulations of mechanical waves in PCs.

Bergamini et al. attempted to integrate active components in PCs to adjust fre-

quency band structures adaptively [25]. Li et al. leveraged helical structures to

realize variable inter-lattice stiﬀness [18], which, in turn, lead to the dynamical

tunability of frequency band structures. In these systems, however, the stiﬀness

parameters of the PCs are altered by external sources and are not controlled

dynamically by the application of mechanical waves.

In the present study we investigate wave dynamics in a PC that is capable

of controlling one wave mode via another in a dynamical manner. This system

is composed of primary and control wave channels, which are interlinked with

each other via a variable stiﬀness mechanism. We ﬁrst develop a theoretical

model to characterize the wave dispersion of the primary channel in relation to

the control waves. As a result, we ﬁnd that the variable stiﬀness mechanism

enables a selective transmission of two diﬀerent wave modes through the primary

channel, and to a further extent, a wave modulation eﬀect. We show that these

characteristics can be tuned by the excitation frequency, magnitude, and phase

of the control wave relative to the primary one. We also verify phenomena such

as mode selection, modulation, and ﬁltering by numerical simulations of the

relevant discrete particle model. Lastly, we assess the feasibility of using the

proposed PC system with a variable stiﬀness mechanism for the realization of

acoustic transistors. We conﬁrm that the system can theoretically present both

switching and ampliﬁcation eﬀects, such that the transmission eﬃciency in the

primary channel can be easily manipulated by the control waves. We conclude

the manuscript with a brief summary of ﬁndings and a discussion of possible

future directions.

2. Theoretical Model of Coupled Phononic Crystals With Variable

Stiﬀness

A conceptual illustration of a coupled PC via a variable stiﬀness mechanism

is shown in Fig. 1. The PC exhibits two wave transmission channels: a primary

wave coupling.

and a control route, which are represented herein by two displacement parame-

ters un and θn, respectively, for the n-th particle (see Fig. 1a). Note that in this

system, the inter-lattice stiﬀness in one channel is aﬀected by the displacement

ﬁelds of the other channel. Figure 1b shows a prototypical system to be inves-

tigated in this study, where there exists a variable stiﬀness mechanism between

the axial and torsional directions. Given a generalized interaction of particles
under a power law, we can express inter-particle forces as Fu ∼ δp and Fθ ∼ αs,
where Fu and Fθ are the axial and torsional force, and δ and α are the axial and

torsional displacements, respectively. p and s are the power-law factors that

determine the force relationship (e.g., p = s =1 for a linear relationship). Based

on this, the equations of motion of this system can be expressed as follows:

M ¨un = ka,(θn−1−θn)[δ0 + un−1 − un]p − ka,(θn−θn−1)[δ0 + un − un+1]p,
I ¨θn = kθ,(un−1−un)[α0 + θn−1 − θn]s − kθ,(un−un−1)[α0 + θn − θn+1]s. (1)

Here, M and I represent the inertia of each particle in axial and tangential

directions, and δ0 and α0 denote the axial and torsional displacements under

static equilibrium, respectively. Note that the two equations above are coupled
since the axial stiﬀness ka,(θn−1−θn) is aﬀected by torsional displacements θn−1−
θn, while the torsional stiﬀness kθ,(un−1−un) is aﬀected by axial displacements
un−1 − un. Therefore, upon the dynamic perturbations applied to the control

4

channel, the stiﬀness along the primary direction ka,(θn−1−θn) will vary, which
in turn aﬀects the propagation of the primary waves. While this work focuses

on the theoretical and numerical investigations of such coupled systems, this

variable stiﬀness system can be realized in various settings. These examples

include compliant mechanisms [31, 32, 33], cylindrical Hertzian contacts [18, 19],

and Kresling origami [34].

In this study, we assume that the stiﬀness parameters in the primary and

control channels are governed by a power-law relationship, similar to the form

of aforementioned force-displacement relationship. Mathematically, this can be
expressed as ka,(θn−1−θn) = Ka(α0 + θn−1 − θn)r and kθ,(un−1−un) = Kθ(δ0 +
un−1 − un)q, where Ka and Kθ are axial and torsional constants, and r and q
are nonlinear factors, respectively. This power-law approximation is plausible,

since dynamic expressions of variable stiﬀness mechanisms can be ﬁt with a

power-law in a local domain of the PC’s vibrational motions. For example,

one may consider a chain of buckled beam elements that connect masses and

support coupled axial and lateral (tangential) motions [35, 36]. Similarly, if

we consider a chain of PC composed of spherical or cylindrical particles under

the Hertz-Mindlin contact law, the contact stiﬀness becomes a function of the

relative angular displacements between neighboring cells deﬁned by the elliptic

integrals [38, 37]. We provide the details of these two prototypical systems in

Appendix.

Under the power-law approximation, Eq.(1) becomes,

M ¨un = Ka[δ0 + un−1 − un]p[α0 + θn−1 − θn]r −
Ka[δ0 + un − un+1]p[α0 + θn − θn+1]r,
I ¨θn = Kθ[δ0 + un−1 − un]q[α0 + θn−1 − θn]s −
Kθ[δ0 + un − un+1]q[α0 + θn − θn+1]s.

(2)

While we solve this nonlinear equation directly in the numerical simulations that

will follow, for our theoretical analysis, we further simplify Eq. (2). For this, we
postulate that small perturbations are applied to the system (i.e, |un−1 − un| (cid:28)

5

δ0 and |θn−1 − θn| (cid:28) α0) and expand and linearize the power terms in (2). As
a result, we obtain the following linearized equations of motion:

(4)

This equation set indeed indicates the coupled mechanisms of the torsional and

axial motions. We should note in passing here that a related system of two-ﬁeld

couplings has been proposed recently as an example of an all-phononic digital

transistor [28]. While the above work presented an amplifying eﬀect due to the

nonlinearity based band-gap transmission mechanism, our studies focus on the

controllability aspect of the system enabled even at the linear level through the

crosstalking between diﬀerent wave modes. In the following sections, we will

systematically investigate wave mode mixing eﬀects in this coupled system.

3. Analytical and Numerical Results of Wave Mixing Eﬀects

3.1. Observation of wave mixing mechanisms

To analyze the coupling of the axial and torsional wave modes, we consider

the plane wave ansatz in the form of the Fourier mode. Mathematically, we

can express ˆun = (cid:101)U ej(ωt+kn) and ˆθn = (cid:101)Θej(ωt+kn), where j =

√−1, (cid:101)U and (cid:101)Θ

are complex variables denoting the amplitude of axial and torsional waves, and

ω and k representing the angular frequency and wavevector, respectively. By

The left panels of (b-c) represent the surface map showing the relative position of each particle

as color intensity with respect to space (horizontal axis) and time (vertical axis) up on the

step excitation input. The group velocities calculated directly from the slope on the analytic

dispersions in (a) were denoted as red (for primary channel) and black (for control channel)

arrows. The right panels of (b-c) show the spatial wave proﬁles at t = 1 ms. The coupled PC

shows that the incident waves propagate with two distinct group velocities (denoted as red

and black arrows on the surface map) in the primary as well as control channels.

7

substituting these expressions into Eq. (4), we obtain the following equations:

Ω(k)2(cid:101)U = 2[(cid:101)U + u(cid:101)Θ][1 − cos(k)],
Ω(k)2(cid:101)Θ = 2[θ(cid:101)U + ρ(cid:101)Θ][1 − cos(k)].

We introduce the non-dimensionalized angular frequency Ω(k)2 = ω(k)2
ω2
a

and

seek nontrivial solutions of the above equations. As a result, we obtain the

following dispersion relationship:

L,H = [(1 + ρ) ±(cid:112)(1 − ρ)2 + 4uθ][1 − cos(k)].

Ω(k)2

(6)

This expression represents two dispersion wave modes, denoted by subscripts

L and H for the lower and higher branches, respectively. These results are

similar to the ones obtained in [28], cf. their Eq. (3). Note that if u = θ = 0,

this dispersion relationship is reduced to a decoupled conﬁguration between

primary and control channels, where the dynamics of the system is described

by two independent dispersion relations.

As we introduce non-zero u and θ, the landscape of the dispersion rela-

tionship starts to be altered. Particularly, the upper cut-oﬀ frequencies of the

higher and lower dispersion branches become functions of the degree of coupling

represented by u and θ:

(cid:113)
2(1 + ρ) − 2(cid:112)(1 − ρ)2 + 4uθ,
(cid:113)
2(1 + ρ) + 2(cid:112)(1 − ρ)2 + 4uθ.

ΩC,L =

ΩC,H =

(5)

(7)

As an example, we show in Fig. 2a the shifted locations of such cutoﬀ frequencies

in the case that ρ = 1.5, u = 1, and θ = 0.5.

The two wave modes in this study are fundamentally diﬀerent from the classi-

cal notion of acoustic and optical modes that can yield a frequency bandgap; our

system generates two wave modes that pass through the origin of the frequency-

wavenumber domain (see Fig. 2a). This implies that the higher branch in our

system encompasses the lower one, and is thereby capable of generating mixed-

mode waves under excitations.

8

To study mixed-mode waves, we conduct numerical simulations of the cou-

pled system and observe propagation of waves in the spatial domain. We specif-

ically consider a coupled PC with 100 particles in each channel and solve Eq. (2)

directly using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta time integration scheme [39]. Figures

2b-c show the spatio-temporal map (left panel) of propagating waves and their

spatial proﬁle at t = 1 ms (right panel) in terms of the relative displacements
(i.e., ˆun − ˆun−1 in Fig. 2b and ˆθn − ˆθn−1 in Fig. 2c). Upon the application of a
simultaneous step force inputs Fu,in and Fθ,in to the system (Fθ,in = 0.5Fu,in is

used in this simulation), we ﬁnd two wave modes propagating in each channel.

The group velocities calculated directly from the analytical dispersion curves

in Fig. 2a (i.e., the slopes at the ﬁrst wave number k = 2π

N , where N = 100)
are in agreement with the speed of the wave packets denoted by red (for higher

mode) and black (for lower mode) arrows in Figs. 2b and 2c. As one can infer

from Fig. 2a, the faster mode corresponds to the higher mode, while the slower,

trailing mode represent the lower mode (see the arrows in Fig. 2b-c). As shown

in the surface maps plotted in the left panels of Fig. 2b-c, we can clearly dis-

tinguish the two simultaneous group velocities in both primary- and control-

channels. Therefore, by the simple onset of the coupling coeﬃcients (i.e., u

and θ), we ﬁnd that the wave dispersion in the primary channel starts to be

aﬀected by the control signal, and vice versa.

3.2. Manipulation of primary wave via control wave

Now that we veriﬁed the eﬀect of wave mixing, the next question is whether

we can manipulate the transmission properties of the primary waves via the

control waves; notice that which one is the primary and which is the control

ﬁeld in our setting is a matter of choice (that can be modiﬁed at will; hence it

is by convention that we make the choice utilized herein). Speciﬁcally, we are

interested in selectively choosing a speciﬁc wave mode in the primary channel

by the application of control waves. To investigate this, we revisit Eq. (5) and

rewrite it in terms of the relative amplitude of the control input with respect to

9

the primary input:

][1 − cos(k)],

Ω(k)2 = 2[θ

Ω(k)2 = 2[1 + u

(cid:101)U(cid:101)Θ
We are now interested in calculating (cid:101)Θ(cid:101)U
By making the two equations in Eq. (8) equal, we obtain two solutions of (cid:101)Θ(cid:101)U

signal on the primary one.

as:

(cid:101)Θ(cid:101)U

(ρ − 1) ±(cid:112)(1 − ρ)2 + 4uθ

(cid:101)Θ(cid:101)U L,H

Since (cid:101)U and (cid:101)Θ are the amplitude of the primary (axial) and control (torsional)

2u

(9)

=

waves based on our convention, they are directly related to the primary and

control force inputs, Fu,in and Fθ,in. That is, in our linear setting, if we excite
the system with the excitation amplitude ratio Fθ,in
Fu,in

identical to (cid:101)Θ(cid:101)U L

, we will

trigger the onset of the lower-mode wave propagation, i.e., Ω(k)L. On the other
hand, when we choose Fθ,in
Fu,in

to be equal to (cid:101)Θ(cid:101)U H

, the wave propagation through

the primary PC follows the higher mode, Ω(k)H .

To demonstrate this, we again solve (2) directly by means of numerical sim-

ulations, considering the case of ρ = 1.5, u = 1, and θ = 0.5, which was shown

to exhibit a coupling mechanism between the primary and control channels in

the previous section (Figs. 2b and 2c). According to Eq. (9), these system

parameters lead to ((cid:101)Θ(cid:101)U

)L = −0.5 and ((cid:101)Θ(cid:101)U

)H = 1. Note that ((cid:101)Θ(cid:101)U

)L should be

negative, which means that the control input Fθ,in should have a π-phase shift

relative to the primary input Fu,in. In Fig. 3, we plot the spatio-temporal maps

(top panel) and spatial proﬁles (at t = 1 ms, bottom panel) of incident waves

propagating through the primary PC as we choose the control input to be one

of these two characteristic solutions. As predicted, we observe the propagation
= −0.5 (Figs. 3a and 3c). If we
of the lower mode only, when we impose Fθ,in
Fu,in
apply Fθ,in
= 1, we ﬁnd the primary channel propagates the higher mode of the
Fu,in

dispersive waves only (Figs. 3b and 3d). In both panels of Figs. 3c and 3d, the

insets show the spatial proﬁle of the control signals. From this simulation, it is

evident that the wave mixing eﬀect in this coupled channel enables us to select a

speciﬁc mode of wave propagation. Also, note the diﬀerence of the propagating

waves’ speed between the two cases (depicted red and black arrows on Figs. 3a

and 3b).

3.3. Switching and modulation eﬀects

Now we investigate the feasibility of modulating and switching output me-

chanical waves using the PC with a variable stiﬀness mechanism. For this, we

ﬁrst examine the frequency responses of the system by exciting each channel

with a chirp signal with a broadband frequency spectrum. We consider three
= −0.5 for the lower
cases of the control- to primary-wave ratios: (i) Fθ,in
Fu,in
mode transmission; (ii) Fθ,in
= 0.5 for the transmission of both lower and
Fu,in
higher modes; and (iii) Fθ,in
Fu,in

= 1 for the higher mode transmission.

three diﬀerent control inputs: (a)

Fθ,in
Fu,in

= −0.5, (b)

Fθ,in
Fu,in

= 0.5, and (c)

Fθ,in
Fu,in

= 1. The

PSD proﬁles of the transmitted force as a function of frequencies are plotted in (d-f) for the

corresponding three excitation conditions. The cutoﬀ frequencies of the higher and lower

modes (ΩC,L and ΩC,H ) are indicated by the dashed lines.

Figure 4a-c shows the power spectral density (PSD) of the mechanical waves

12

transmitted through the primary channel for the three cases. We obtain these

plots by conducting a two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) of the

particles’ velocities in the time and space domains. In the ﬁrst case when we
= −0.5, we observe the dominant presence of the
excite the system with Fθ,in
Fu,in
lower mode (Fig. 4a). This is consistent with the result of the system’s mode

selection capability discussed in the previous section. Similarly, we can also

characterize the frequency response of the system by calculating the force ratio
of the transmitted wave relative to the input wave ( Fu,out
Fu,in

, see Fig. 1 for these

parameters). As a result, we ﬁnd the lower pass band (0 < Ω < ΩC,L) exhibits

much higher PSD compared to that of the higher pass band (ΩC,L < Ω < ΩC,H )

(see Fig. 4d). This again conﬁrms the system’s capability of selective wave

transmission. The peak in the upper frequency band is generated due to the

intrinsic nonlinearity of the system, since the numerical simulations are based

on the nonlinear equation (Eq. (2)).

If we gradually increase the control input, we start to observe the onset of

the higher mode. For example, we see the existence of the two modes clearly
when Fθ,in
Fu,in

= 0.5 (Fig. 4b). The corresponding PSD of the transmitted force

also shows the presence of both modes as shown in Fig. 4e. As we increase

the control wave further to the magnitude and phase identical to that of the
primary wave (i.e., Fθ,in
Fu,in

= 1), we witness that the higher mode takes over

the lower mode as shown in Fig. 4c. In terms of the relative eﬃciency of the

transmitted wave, we ﬁnd a single low pass band that covers the frequency range

from 0 to ΩC,H (Fig. 4f). Note that the dispersion relationship obtained from

the 2D-FFT agrees well with the analytical dispersion curves in the previous

section (compare Fig. 2b with Figs. 4a-c presented here). During the transition

between the lower- to the higher-mode wave propagation, we witness that the

transmission eﬃciency in the frequency range of ΩC,L < Ω < ΩC,H increases

gradually. This translates into the switching capability of the system, which

controls the transmission eﬃciency of waves in the primary channel by the

application of the control waves.

As presented in Fig. 4, there are two frequency domains of interest in the

13

presented PC system with the variable stiﬀness mechanism, which are 0 < Ω <

ΩC,L and ΩC,L < Ω < ΩC,H . To see how the coupled PC responds in these

two frequency domains, we conduct another set of numerical simulations using

harmonic excitations applied to the system. Speciﬁcally, we excite the system

with a single harmonic function at two diﬀerent frequencies: Ωe,L and Ωe,H .

These two frequencies belong to the frequency domains, 0 < Ωe,L < ΩC,L and

ΩC,L < Ωe,H < ΩC,H , targeting to capture the harmonic response of the system

in these two distinct bands (See Fig. 5).

Figures 5a-5c show the harmonic responses of the system at Ωe,L under
= −0.5, 0.5, and 1, respectively. The left panel shows
the frequency-wavenumber response of the system, while the right panel shows
= −0.5, we
captured images of particles’ displacements in space. When Fθ,in
Fu,in
observe an oscillatory pattern of the particles in the space domain, whose wave-

14

length corresponds to the lower branch of the dispersion relationship (denoted

by λL in Fig. 5a). We observe a similar oscillatory wave in space, if we excite
the system at Ωe,L and Fθ,in
Fu,in
wave in the higher mode, as indicated by k = 2π
λH

= 1 (Fig. 5c). This corresponds to the dispersive

in the surface map of Fig. 5c.

In the transition regime between the two cases, however, we ﬁnd an interesting
phenomenon. As shown in Fig. 5b when Fθ,in
Fu,in

= 0.5, the wave propagation

through the primary channel shows a modulation eﬀect between the higher and

lower modes. As shown in the spatial wave proﬁle in the right panel of Fig. 5b,

this modulation eﬀect generates signals composed of two wavelengths, which

are denoted as λL− and λL+. These wavelengths satisfy λL− < λL < λL+
(compare the length of the arrows for λL−, λL, and λL+ shown in right panel of

Fig. 5b). This is due to the mixing of the higher and lower wave modes, which

is realized through this variable stiﬀness mechanism between the primary and

control channels. This is the one of intriguing features of the coupled PC that

can be exploited for engineering applications. As we expect from Eq. (8), the
wavelength of the modulated signal depends on the control input, Fθ,in
Fu,in

, and

further discussion on this can be found in Appendix B.

We also test the dynamics of the system under the excitation at Ωe,H as

shown in Figs. 5d-5f. Since there exists only one possible wave mode in this

channel is signiﬁcantly attenuated in the frequency domain (Fig. 5d). The inset

of the right panel in Fig. 5d shows drastic attenuation of the incident wave in

the form of evanescent waves. While we demonstrated the wave attenuation

in a single frequency, we see that such attenuation can be achieved in broad

band frequencies in the range of ΩC,L < Ωe,H < ΩC,H . This can distinguish our

system with other active vibration control methods, which typically target single

or narrow-band noise and vibration [5, 23]. As we increase the control input
further to Fθ,in
Fu,in

= 0.5 and 1, we observe the transmission of waves, corresponding

to the higher mode of dispersive waves (Figs. 5e and f). Note that a similar

eﬀect of selective wave ﬁltering has been discussed recently in a weakly nonlinear

15

phononic system [28].

4. Design Parameters of the Coupled Phononic Crystal

Now we investigate the evolution of the two dispersion modes under various

conditions of coupling between primary (axial) and control (torsional) waves.

For this, we examine the eﬀect of coupling parameters u, θ, and ρ on the cutoﬀ

frequencies of the higher and lower dispersion branches. Since u and θ play

an identical role mathematically (see Eq. (7)), we assess the response of cut-oﬀ

frequencies as a function of u and ρ only (Fig. 6). The three surface maps in

Figs. 6a-c represent the cases when θ = 0, 0.5, and 1.5.

Figure 6: Surface maps of the two cut-oﬀ frequencies, ΩC,L and ΩC,H , as a function of u

and ρ. We consider three diﬀerent conditions: (a) θ = 0, (b) θ = 0.5, and (c) θ = 1.5.

When θ = 0 (Fig. 6a), the two dispersion curves appear with Ω(k)2 =
2[1 − cos(k)] and Ω(k)2 = 2ρ[1 − cos(k)] according to Eq. (6). Here, we ﬁnd
that the two cut-oﬀ frequencies of these dispersive wave modes depend only on

ρ, without showing any dependence on u (Fig. 6a). It should be noted that

while the cut-oﬀ frequencies are not aﬀected by u, the transmission eﬃciency

in the primary channel are aﬀected by the control signal. This is evident by the

fact that u is placed in the denominator of the eﬃciency expression in Eq. (9).

In contrast, we ﬁnd that the control signal is not aﬀected by the primary wave

mode when θ = 0 (see the equation of motion in Eq. (4)). As we increase θ

from zero, the landscape of dispersive relationship starts to show its dependence

on u, skewing the surface map of the two cut-oﬀ frequencies, ΩC,L and ΩC,H as

16

shown in Fig. 6b-c. Interestingly, we also observe some regions where a certain

combination of ρ and u yields no or only a single cutoﬀ frequency. These regions
are deﬁned by two boundaries, u < − 1

5. Acoustic Transistor via the Coupled Phononic Crystal

In this section, we investigate the wave transmission property and the cor-

responding wave mixing eﬀect of the proposed system. We compare the char-

acteristic of the system’s response with that of the conventional transistor, to

assess its feasibility as an acoustic transistor (AT). As discussed in Section 4

and shown in Fig. 4, the coupled PC with a variable stiﬀness mechanism is

capable of controlling transmission eﬃciency of the primary channel’s signals

in the frequency domain between the higher and lower cut-oﬀ frequencies (i.e.,

ΩC,L < Ω < ΩC,H ). When we excite this system with a frequency in this do-

main, the transmission eﬃciency through the primary channel can be altered in

relation to the control signal applied to the system.

Figure 7a shows an example of the AT eﬀect when we use ρ = 1.5, u = 1,

and θ = 0.078. The x -axis denotes the control force relative to the primary

wave’s force amplitude, while the y-axis represents the transmission eﬃciency in

the primary channel, also relative to the primary wave’s amplitude. To obtain
this curve, the normalized amplitude of output signal Fu,out

1,θ = 0.078. The solid vertical line corresponds to the oﬀ state, in which the signal in the pri-

mary channel is not transmitted. The dashed vertical line corresponds to zero control input.
Transmission in this case is still possible. The red 45◦ line indicates that the control input
amplitude and transmission amplitude are identical. Thus, transmission amplitude above this

line corresponds to ampliﬁcation. (b) Change of system’s characteristic curves as we vary

u = 1, 2, and 3. The inset shows the magniﬁed view of the curves near the zero transmission

we ﬁnd that the transmission can be blocked by imposing the control input

Fu,in
this phenomenon is consistent with what we found in previous sections. As we

(see the vertical solid line). This corresponds to oﬀ status, and

change the control input from this oﬀ state, the transmission eﬃciency of the

primary channel gradually increases. This corresponds to the on state of the

AT.

Interestingly, we note that at zero control input, we still have a portion of

mechanical waves transmitted through the system (vertical dashed line in Fig.

7a).

In the narrow region between this zero control input and the oﬀ states

(i.e., the region between the two vertical lines), the increase of control signal

towards the negative direction (i.e., π phase diﬀerence between primary and

control waves) reduces the eﬃciency of the primary channel’s output. This is

in contrast to the increasing trend of the transmission eﬃciency described in

the previous paragraph. Farther past this zone towards the negative x -axis, the

increase of the control wave’s magnitude results in the enhancement of the wave

transmission in the primary channel.

The plot in Fig. 7a is similar to the characteristic curve of conventional

bipolar junction transistor (BJT) [40]. While the current iCE from the collector

(C) to emitter (E) is controlled by the electric potential vBE (voltage diﬀerence

between base and emitter) in the electrical transistor, the proposed AT system
deals with the control Fθ,in

by choosing the operating point on this characteristic curve in a way similar

(acoustic counter part of iCE). That is, we can control the wave output

(acoustic counter part of vBE) and the force output

to the electrical transistor. However, the main diﬀerence of the characteristic

)L to turn the AT oﬀ completely (again, it transmits the wave with

Lastly, we show that the characteristic curve can be altered by employing

diﬀerent sets of design parameters. While there exists a variety of choices in

terms of the design parameters as discussed in the previous section, we present

a simple example in Fig. 7b, when we vary u = 1, 2, and 3. When we have

19

ρ = 0.5 and θ = 0.078, the turn oﬀ point moves towards left in the x -axis as

we introduce a larger u (see the inset of Fig. 7b). The slope of the curves also

changes as we adopt diﬀerent u. This is plausible, since u determines how

much the dynamics in the control channel aﬀects the wave transmission in the

primary channel. Thus, we observe a steeper curve as we introduce a higher u.

In this section, we numerically demonstrated that the PC system investi-

gated in this study is capable of manipulating the primary channel’s transmis-

sion eﬃciency through the control wave, which corresponds to the switching

function of conventional transistors. Another key feature of such conventional

transistors is an ampliﬁcation function, which enables manipulating a large-

amplitude output signal using a small-amplitude control signal. The system

proposed in this study meets this requirement in certain regimes. For instance,

the slanted lines in Figs. 7a and 7b show the lines that denote the same mag-

nitude between Fθ,in and Fu,out. We observe that the system in Fig. 7a does

not meet this ampliﬁcation requirement, while the ones in Fig. 7b successfully

produce output waves’ amplitude larger than that of the control wave. Thus,

we numerically verify that the PC system equipped with a variable stiﬀness

mechanism can be potentially exploited to be used as a mechanical counterpart

of transistor systems.

6. Conclusions and Future Challenges

In this study we proposed a coupled phononic crystal (PC) with a variable

stiﬀness mechanism and investigated its wave dynamics via analytical and nu-

merical approaches. The focus was placed on the mixing eﬀect of mechanical

waves propagating along primary and control channels. We veriﬁed that this

wave mixing eﬀect enables not only the control over the transmission eﬃciency

of propagating waves, but also selective transmission of speciﬁc wave modes

and eventually wave modulation eﬀect. To the further extent, we showed the

feasibility of realizing acoustic transistors, which fulﬁll both switching and am-

pliﬁcation functionalities, using the proposed phononic system.

20

This article proposed a number of possibilities within the study of PCs and

can serve as a guide for several other avenues for future study. Some of these

potential future directions include the role of nonlinearity and the study of the

additional structures that are made possible due to nonlinearity, such as travel-

ing wave and breather solutions [28]. Importantly, it should be mentioned that

relevant mechanisms may be considerably richer in higher dimensional settings,

where the corresponding dispersion relation may enable intriguing possibilities

(including a dependence on the direction or angle of propagation). Moreover,

the interplay of nonlinearity with dimensionality may be of interest, as the ex-

istence properties of nonlinear states relevant to the present setting may be

drastically diﬀerent in higher dimensions [41]. Additionally, the extension to

non-homogeneous systems would make a natural future direction. Finally, the

experimental veriﬁcation of the system remains an open problem, but that is

within reach given the state-of-art of PCs, which includes granular crystals [42],

origami [43], and truss structures [44]. Such studies will be reported on in future

publications.

Examples of coupled PCs with a variable stiﬀness mechanism

Lumped masses connected with buckled beam elements can exhibit a variable

stiﬀness mechanism (see Fig. 8a). Here we consider a beam whose middle portion

is rigid, while both ends can be buckled [35] (Fig. 8a). If we simplify the system

also plot those relations with power-law ﬁt, Ka(∆u)p(∆θ)r (Ka = 1.591 × 108,

and r = 0.726) as surface maps in Fig. 8b-c. Here we used kT = 1 × 107 N/deg,
L = 0.5 m, and R = 0.2 m. As we described in Section 2, these ﬁtted data

demonstrate that this post-buckled system can exhibit the variable stiﬀness

mechanism in the form of a power-law.

arranged cylindrical particles, which are in contact with each other via the Hertzian contact

The ﬁtted curve with power-law approximations is also plotted in blue dots. Insets show the

geometrical conﬁgurations of the helicoidal phononic crystal in side and front views.

Another system that can exhibit the variable stiﬀness mechanism is a heli-

coidal phononic crystal (HPC), where the contact stiﬀness in the axial direction

is given as a function of the relative angle between neighboring cells as below [18]:

Here, Y represents the Young’s modulus of HPC and ν the Poisson ratio.

K(e) and E(e) are the complete elliptic integrals of the ﬁrst and second kinds,

respectively, and e = (cid:112)1 − [cos ∆θ/(1 + cos ∆θ)]4/3 is the eccentricity of the

elliptical contact area between two cylindrical particles. By using Y = 72 GPa

and ν = 0.17, we ﬁnd that the elliptic integral forms can be ﬁt with the power
law approximation, ka,(θn−1−θn) = Ka(θn−1 − θn)r = 1.04× 108(θn−1 − θn)−0.55
as plotted in blue dots in Fig. 9. When we consider the HPC connected with

linear torsional springs as depicted in the second inset in Fig. 9, we can simply

describe the torsional stiﬀness, kθ,(un−1−un) = Kθ. In this case, p, q, r and s in
Eq. (2) can be determined to be p = 1.5, q = 0, r = −0.55 and s = 1 using the
parameters used in this example. Note that we have zero q, since in this HPC,

torsional waves aﬀect the axial waves, but not vice versa.

Controllability of output wavelength via control frequency

diﬀerent control inputs; Fθ,in

= 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9. We plot the spatio-temporal

maps of the particles’ displacements in Fig. 10a-10c. The bottom panels in Fig.
10 show the corresponding spatial wave proﬁle at t = 40 ms. When Fθ,in

(Fig. 10a), the two wavelengths are very close to λL (the diﬀerence between
two wavelengths, λL− and λL+ is small). However, when inspecting the wave

propagation in time and space domain, we can distinguish two diﬀerent group

velocities denoted as vg− (red arrow in Fig. 10a) and vg+ (blue arrow). The

∂Ω(k)

slopes of these arrows are calculated from the analytic dispersion in Eq. (5) (i.e.,

larger, as depicted in Fig. 10b. Further increase of the control input makes the

wavelength λL− approach zero and λL+ approach λH , as shown in Fig. 10c.

In brief, our simulation reveals that as we increase the control input from the
lower mode solution Fθ,in

of modulated signals by simple manipulation of the control input.

Existence of non-trivial cutoﬀ frequencies

To investigate the design parameters of the coupled phononic crystal, we

plotted surface maps of the system’s frequencies as a function of design pa-

rameters in Section 4. To ease visualization, these maps can be plotted in a

planar space, see Fig. 11 for θ = 0.5. The higher and lower cutoﬀ frequencies

(i.e., ΩC,L and ΩC,H ) of the system are illustrated in Fig. 11a and 11b, respec-

tively. We ﬁnd that the highlighted zones are bounded by the aforementioned
characteristic equations (u = − 1

(1 − ρ)2 and u = ρ

). We also see that

two non-trivial cutoﬀ frequencies.

depending on the combination of ρ and u, we have three distinctive regions:

(Zone I) non-existence of cutoﬀ frequency, where the primary wave is not al-

lowed to transmit; (Zone II) existence of a single cutoﬀ frequency, where only

the higher mode can be supported, and (Zone III) existence of two distinctive

cutoﬀ frequencies, where both higher and lower modes are supported (see Fig.

11). Note that the particular case that we discussed in Section 3 (i.e., ρ = 1.5,

u = 1 and θ = 0.5) belongs to the Zone III, where we can selectively choose

and manipulate the eﬃciency of the two modes.
