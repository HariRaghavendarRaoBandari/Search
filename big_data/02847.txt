The 6S1/2 − 5D5/2 electric quadrupole transition is
investigated in Cesium vapor at room temperature
via nonlinear Doppler-free 6P-6S-5D three-level spec-
troscopy. Frequency-resolved studies of individual E2
hyperﬁne lines allow one to analyze optical pumping
dynamics, polarization selection rules and line intensi-
ties. It opens the way to studies of transfer of light or-
bital angular momentum to atoms, and the inﬂuence of
metamaterials on E2 line spectra. © 2016 Optical Society of

tra and resolve the hyperﬁne lines of the 6S1/2 − 5D3/2 E2 tran-
sition. Recent studies include Doppler-free 5p-6p transitions in
Rubidium [10] and magnetic-ﬁeld-mixing of forbidden hyper-
ﬁne transitions of Cs D2 line [11]. Another well-explored ap-
proach to study the internal structure of highly-excited D lev-
els of alkalis and measure their energy makes use of Doppler-
free two-photon spectroscopy [12, 13]. In this letter we analyze
Doppler-free hyperﬁne spectral lines of the Cs 6S1/2 − 5D5/2
E2 transition, as observed via three-level Raman-type nonlin-
ear spectroscopy [14–16] on the 6P-6S-5D coupled system. We
investigate polarization properties and optical pumping pro-
cesses responsible for the E2 spectral line intensities, demon-
strating the important role played by transit time relaxation.
This work should pave the way to investigate such speciﬁc
properties as transfer of non-zero e.m. orbital angular momen-
tum to atomic systems [17, 18], vapor-surface physics [7, 8] and
atomic gas combined with nanostructured interface [19–21].

With the appearance of laser sources, nonlinear Doppler-free
Laser Spectroscopy (DFLS) has undergone a very fast develop-
ment.
It has been utilized for atomic and molecular spectral
analyses, collisional studies in the vapor phase and investiga-
tion of fundamental processes [1, 2]. Up to now, in atomic
physics, DFLS has been mainly performed by using laser
sources resonant for electric-dipole (E1) s. Dipole-forbidden
transitions, particularly electric quadrupole (E2) transitions, are
important in new avenues of atomic physics for fundamen-
tal studies like parity violation [3] or devising of ultra-high-
accuracy optical clocks [4–6]. Spectroscopic studies of E2 transi-
tions in vapors are generally hindered by Doppler-broadening,
and in most cases averaged over the internal structure of the
E2 transition (e.g. hyperﬁne multiplets) [7, 8]. A noteworthy
exception is the early work by Weber and Sansonetti [9] who
performed resonantly enhanced stepwise excitation to high ly-
ing states of Cesium, using the 5D3/2 level as the intermediates
state. In this way, they have been able to get Doppler-free spec-

To investigate Doppler-free spectroscopic characteristics on
an E2 transition, we address the 6S1/2 → 6D5/2 transition
of Cesium at λ = 685 nm (Fig. 1). This E2 line has a tran-
sition rate of γ5D−6S = 2π · 3.5 Hz [8]. Considering solely
ﬂuorescence decay, the saturation intensity behaves like Is =
2π2
5D = 2π · 124 kHz is the ﬂu-
3λ3 ¯hc
orescence rate of 5D5/2 state which almost exclusively comes
from the 5D5/2 → 6P3/2 E1 line at 3.5 µm [22]. The 685 nm
laser has an output power of 11 mW and a minimum beam
waist around ω0 = 125 µm. So the maximum laser intensity
attainable is I ≈ 40 Wcm−2 which should be above the satura-
tion intensity of the transition. However one should note that
the transit time broadening, added to radiative relaxation, in-
creases the total relaxation rate of the 5D5/2 state by more than
a factor of 2, and thus Is by a factor of ∼ 8. To monitor Doppler-
free lines at 685 nm, we have adopted a pump-probe three-level
spectroscopy approach [14, 15] in which population changes
induced in the 6S1/2 ground state by a 685 nm laser are mon-
itored on the 6S1/2 → 6P3/2 line transmission at λ = 852 nm

(Fig. 1). The radiative linewidth of the 852 nm transition is
γ6P−6S = 2π · 5.23 MHz. As it corresponds to the fastest charac-
teristic time of the system, this linewidth imposes the ultimate
spectral resolution on the E2 transition resonances. Taking into
account the difference in wavenumbers between wavelengths
at 685 nm and at 852 nm, we ﬁnd an ultimate spectral resolu-
tion on the E2 transition resonances of 852/685 × γ6P−6S ≈
2π · 6.6 MHz[14, 15]. Hence, our pump/probe spectroscopy
technique would not give information on the bare linewidth of
the E2 transition but it is able to resolve the hyperﬁne structure
of the transition.

The schematic of the experiment setup is depicted in ﬁgure 2.
The 852 nm External Cavity Diode Laser (ECDL) is frequency
locked onto one of the hyperﬁne transition of the 6S1/2 → 6P3/2
line, thanks to a saturated absorption side-experiment per-
formed on an auxiliary room-temperature Cs Vapor cell (cell 1
of Fig. 2). We also address the 685 nm transition using an ECDL.

Fig. 3. Fluorescence spectrum at 852 nm (dashed red curve)
where only the 685 nm laser beam is present. The solid blue
curve is a ﬁt composed of ﬁve Gaussian proﬁles (red curves).
The dashed vertical lines correspond to the relative position of
the hyperﬁne structure. The origin of the frequency is taken at
the F = 4 → F = 6 resonance.

The 685 nm laser beam is amplitude-modulated at 18 kHz us-
ing an Acousto-Optic Modulator (AOM) operating at 80 MHz.
It is focused and counter propagates with the similarly focused
852 nm laser beam inside a 5 cm long room-temperature main
Cs vapor cell. Inside this cell, the 852 nm peak laser intensity is
2 mW/cm2, i.e. below saturation intensity. The 18 kHz modu-
lation amplitude, induced on the 852 nm transmission via three-
level saturation spectroscopy, is then extracted using a lock-in
ampliﬁer. These transmission spectra are recorded as functions
of the frequency of the 685 nm laser. The 685 nm frequency,
scanned over the Doppler proﬁle is monitored by collecting the
ﬂuorescence at 852 nm in a second auxiliary vapor cell operated
at temperature, T = 55 ◦C (Cell 2 in Fig. 2). The 685 nm fre-
quency scale is calibrated by comparing the ﬂuorescence spec-
tra obtained with zeroth and ﬁrst order AOM diffracted beams.
With only the 685 nm light, the ﬂuorescence signal at 852 nm
comes from the radiative cascade 5D5/2 → 6P3/2 → 6S1/2. An
example of a ﬂuorescence spectrum is shown in Fig. 3. The
685 nm laser is tuned from the F = 4 hyperﬁne ground state.
Thus according to the selection rules of a quadrupole transition,
the F = 4 → F′ = 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 lines can be observed. Those
transitions are not resolved in Doppler spectroscopy due to the
small hyperﬁne splitting of the 5D5/2 state. However the asym-
metry of the ﬂuorescence spectrum is a clear signature of the
presence of several transitions. Moreover, we calculate the tran-
sitions relative intensities, based only on the E2 absorption line
strengths (J, F → J′, F′)[23]:

with I = 7/2. We now place a Gaussian proﬁle for each hyper-
ﬁne transition at its correct relative frequency separation (see
Fig. 3) with a relative weight, given by Eq. (1). Using a global
frequency shift and an identical width for the Gaussians as the
two free ﬁtting parameters, we are able to recover the experi-
mental proﬁle of the ﬂuorescence signal at 852 nm with an ex-
cellent agreement.

Figures 4 and 5 shows two typical Doppler-free pump-probe
spectra. Here the 852 nm laser is frequency locked to the
6S1/2(F = 4) → 6P3/2(F′ = 5) transition whereas the 685 nm
laser is scanned across either the 6S1/2(F = 4) to 5D5/2(F′)

These experimental spectra call for some remarks concerning se-
lection rules, amplitudes, sideband resonances and linewidths.

(i). The 685 nm light couples the hyperﬁne transitions satis-
fying the quadrupole transition selection rules, i.e. −2 ≤
∆F ≤ 2. In ﬁgure 4, excitation spectra on the F = 4 →
F′ = 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 lines are indeed observed. Since the
lasers at 685 nm and 852 nm are sharing the same F = 4
ground state, the signal is revealed mainly through opti-
cal de-pumping of this state. Thus the transmission sig-
nal at 852 nm will be in-phase with the 18 kHz modula-
tion leading to a positive, i.e. emission-like spectrum, as
seen in ﬁgure 4. On the contrary, if the lasers are not
sharing the same ground state, the transmission signal at
852 nm will originate in an optical re-pumping scheme and
be out-of-phase with the 18 kHz modulation leading to a
negative, i.e. absorption-like spectrum. This situation is
illustrated on ﬁgure 5. Here the optical pumping from
the ground state F = 3 to the ground state F = 4 is
done through a 685 nm absorption event followed by a
5D5/2 → 6P3/2 → 6S1/2 radiative cascade event. Both
events have the same −2 ≤ ∆F ≤ 2 selection rules. Thus
only the four F = 3 → F′ = 2, 3, 4 & 5 lines of the E2 transi-
tion are observed, whereas the F = 3 → F′ = 1 transition
is missing since it cannot decay back to the 6S1/2 F = 4
state.

(ii). The different line intensities depend on the hyperﬁne lev-
els involved in the optical pumping process, and eventu-
ally on the relative polarizations of the 685 nm and 852 nm
lasers. However, one should note that due to fast tran-
sit time in the beam, the 852 nm irradiation does not in-
duce optical pumping between magnetic sublevels in the
ground state. Also, for a F = 4 → 5 transition, a linearly

the 6S1/2(F = 3) to 5D5/2(F′ = 2–5) transitions. We use the
same notation as in Fig. 4

polarized irradiation is nearly equivalent to an isotropic
light probe. This explains why the spectra are similar for
parallel and perpendicular polarizations, as seen in ﬁgs 4
and 5. One may thus calculate the line intensities, based
only on SQ
FF′ (Eq. (1)), and E1 emission line strengths (for
both 5D → 6P and 6P → 6S as given by:

is a re-pumping ratio which takes into account the transit
relaxation rate, described phenomenologically by an expo-
nential decay rate γt. This transit relaxation is mainly effec-
tive in the long-lived 5D state. By increasing the 5D relax-
ation rate, it diminishes the re-pumping back to the ground
state (second term in Eq. (3)). The transit relaxation rate
may be approximated roughly by γt ∼< v⊥ > /w0. With
the transverse mean thermal velocity across the laser beam,
< v⊥ >≈ 170 ms−1, and the beam waist, w0 ≈ 125 µm,
we predict α ≈ 0.4. This is a quite approximate prediction
because transit time broadening is mainly governed by a
Gaussian probability distribution. If F1 = F2 (same hyper-
ﬁne ground state), the line intensity depends on both de-
population and re-population pumping, as well as on the
transit time relaxation. As shown in ﬁgure 4, a very good
match is obtained for α = 0.56 ± 0.02 (i.e. γt = 0.8γse

value not far from the rough estimate above. Note the ma-
jor role of transit broadening. In its absence (α = 1), the
repopulation in the F = 4 ground state [after E2 excitation
to the 5D5/2(F = 6) level] should exactly cancel the de-
population pumping (inside the close three-level system,
F = 4 − 6 − 5 − 4). The observation of the F = 6 resonance
(Fig. 4) is a direct evidence for the transit time inﬂuence re-
sponsible for losses in the optical pumping process. On the
other hand, for the F1 6= F2 cross resonances (Fig. 5), there
is no similar effect. Only the overall spectrum amplitude
will depend on α.

(iii). Small amplitudes transmission peaks, appearing on the
red side of the main resonances (Figs. 3–5) are sideband
resonances. They correspond to the 6S1/2(F = 4) →
6P3/2(F = 4) transition resonantly excited for a non-
zero atomic velocity group[14, 15]. Taking into account
the different Doppler shifts, we ﬁnd a frequency shift be-
tween the two sets of resonances of ~k685/~k852 × ∆5−4 =
−312 MHz,where ∆5−4 = 251 MHz is the F = 5 − F = 4
hyperﬁne splitting of the 6P3/2 excited state. Since the laser
beams are counter propagating, the sidebands lie on the
red side of the resonances. With co-propagating beams, the
shift would be on the blue side of the main resonances.

(iv). The ultimate resonance linewidth is ∼ 6.6 MHz. The ex-
perimental linewidths are larger, about 15 MHz. The extra
broadening may be due to the 852 nm power broadening,
collisions and the 685 nm laser jitter.

In conclusion, we have observed Doppler-free spectral lines
on the Cs 6S1/2 − 5D5/2 transition and analyzed some of their
properties, like selection rules and saturation intensities. This
work paves the way for further investigations like the gen-
eral polarization characteristics of E2 absorption, or the inﬂu-
ence of near-ﬁeld surface potentials on E2 line emission. An-
gular momentum conservation in matter-light interaction in-
volves photon spin only in Gaussian light beams. In the work
presented here, one thus expects to induce ∆M = ±1 transi-
tions in E2 absorption at 685 nm. If instead one uses focused
Laguerre-Gauss (LG) beams, one expects that orbital angular
momentum of light can be absorbed and thus produce ∆M =
0, ±1, ±2 transitions[17, 18]. These could be observed via E2
Zeeman transitions in applied magnetic ﬁelds. E2 transitions
can be monitored in zero-electric-ﬁeld regions of LG beams and
should allow one to map their spatial intensity distributions[18].
Another prospect lies in the analysis of atom-metamaterial hy-
brid systems. Engineering of atom-surface interactions in such
hybrid devices have been recently demonstrated by monitor-
ing the atom response on E1 transitions[24]. Similar work on
E2 transitions will allow exploring e.m. ﬁeld gradients in the
vicinity of metamaterials.
