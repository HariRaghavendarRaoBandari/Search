Introduction

To begin, we consider a motivating question.

“Given a stratiﬁed map f : Y → X, how are the path components of f−1(x) organized?”

Informally speaking, a map is stratiﬁed if it is proper and there is a partition S of X into
manifolds so that over each manifold S ∈ S the map f−1(S) → S is a ﬁber bundle.

One perspective on this question uses the open sets of X to deﬁne a functor(cid:98)F : Open(X) →
prototypical example of a cosheaf of sets. The assumption that f is stratiﬁed endows(cid:98)F with

Set that assigns to each open U the set π0(f−1(U)) of path components. This functor
satisﬁes a gluing axiom reminiscent of the usual van Kampen theorem, which makes it the

a strong property called constructibility.
Robert MacPherson observed that paths in X can be used to organize π0(f−1(x)). A path
from x to x(cid:48) lying entirely in a single stratum S ∈ S induces an isomorphism π0(f−1(x)) →
π0(f−1(x(cid:48))). Suppose x(cid:48) lies in a stratum on the frontier of S. MacPherson noticed that a
path from x to x(cid:48) that leaves one stratum only by entering into a lower-dimensional stratum
deﬁnes a map π0(f−1(x)) → π0(f−1(x(cid:48))). Such paths are called entrance paths and this map
between components is invariant under certain homotopic perturbations. One then thinks of
this data as a functor F : Ent(X, S) → Set from the entrance path category Ent(X, S) whose
objects are points of X and whose morphisms are certain homotopy classes of entrance paths.
One of the results of this paper is a proof that these two perspectives are equivalent.
This equivalence is a consequence of a more general result, which we call the Classiﬁcation
Theorem for Constructible Cosheaves (Theorem 2). The purpose of this paper is to provide
a concise and self-contained proof of this theorem. This requires two novel deﬁnitions:

• A constructible cosheaf over a stratiﬁed space (X, S) is usually deﬁned as a functor

(cid:98)F : Open(X) → Ω that satisﬁes a gluing axiom and that restricts to a local system over
each stratum. To restrict a cosheaf to a stratum is to pull-back(cid:98)F along the inclusion of
the associated map(cid:98)F(V) →(cid:98)F(U) is an isomorphism. By our Classiﬁcation Theorem,
the restriction of(cid:98)F to a stratum S is equivalent to a representation of the fundamental

that stratum and then cosheaﬁfy, which is not a straightforward process. Our deﬁnition
(Deﬁnition 8) bypasses this process by asking that for certain pairs of open sets V ⊆ U,

groupoid of S. Our deﬁnition of a constructible cosheaf implies the usual deﬁnition.

• The exit path category, which is the opposite of the entrance path category, appears
in the dissertation work of Treumann [5]. He deﬁnes an equivalence of entrance paths
from x to x(cid:48) as a one-parameter family of entrance paths from x to x(cid:48) satisfying a
certain tameness condition. We describe this condition as a ﬁnite number of elementary
operations (Deﬁnition 15) where each operation shortcuts an entrance path by skipping
past at most one stratum.

In pursuit of our main theorem, we prove a van Kampen theorem (Theorem 1) for the
entrance path category. We conclude with a classiﬁcation theorem for stratiﬁed coverings
(Theorem 3).

Since Treumann, similar equivalences in the setting of higher categories have appeared;
see Lurie [3] and Ayala/Francis/Tanaka [1]. Indeed, the deﬁnitions we provide here naturally
generalize to higher categories but this is not our goal. Our goal is to provide deﬁnitions and
proofs that are understandable by anyone with a basic knowledge of point-set topology and
category theory. We note that Woolf [6] provides a classiﬁcation of covering spaces similar
to our own but his results are stated for homotopically stratiﬁed spaces and do not yield the
general classiﬁcation theorem we provide.

2 Stratiﬁed Spaces

C(L) = L × [0,∞)/ ∼

where

Deﬁnition 1: Given a topological space L, an open cone on L is

We write(cid:2)((cid:96), t)(cid:3) for the equivalence class of ((cid:96), t). Denote the cone point(cid:2)((cid:96), 0)(cid:3) by (cid:63).

((cid:96), 0) ∼ ((cid:96)(cid:48), 0) ∀(cid:96), (cid:96)(cid:48) ∈ L.

Deﬁnition 2 (Goresky and MacPherson [2]): An n-dimensional topological stratiﬁed

space X is a ﬁltration

∅ = X−1 ⊂ X0 ⊂ X2 ⊂ ··· Xn = X

of a Hausdorﬀ space X by closed subspaces such that for each d and each point x ∈ Xd −Xd−1
there is an open neighborhood Ux ⊂ X of x, a compact (n − d − 1)-dimensional topological
stratiﬁed space Lx, and a ﬁltration preserving homeomorphism

hx : Rd × C(Lx) → Ux

2

taking (0, (cid:63)) to x. Any such Ux is called a basic open. A connected component of Xd −Xd−1
is called a d-dimensional stratum.

It will be convenient to write a topological stratiﬁed space as a tuple (X, S) where S is
its set of strata. For an open set U ⊆ X, we write (U, SU) for the topological stratiﬁed space
that is the restriction of (X, S) to U.

By restricting the homeomorphism hx to

(cid:12)(cid:16)
v,(cid:2)(p, t)(cid:3)(cid:17) ∈ Rd × C(Lx)

(cid:13)
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ||v|| < r and t < r

,

we have a basic open Ux(r) ⊂ X for every r > 0. Thus the poset of basic opens Basic(X, S)
is a basis for the topology on X.
Deﬁnition 3: Given a basic open Ux ∈ Basic(X, S), its associated stratum is the stratum
containing x. This is the unique lowest dimensional stratum of S intersecting U.

Suppose a basic open Ux is associated to a stratum S ∈ S. Then Ux can be viewed as a
basic open neighborhood of every point x(cid:48) ∈ S ∩ Ux. Thus we drop the subscript and write
U ∈ Basic(X, S).

Deﬁnition 4: A basic covering of (X, S) is a subposet C ⊆ Basic(X, S) such that(cid:83)

C∈C C =

X and every ﬁnite intersection of sets in C is a union of sets in C.
Deﬁnition 5: A stratum-preserving map f : (Y, T ) → (X, S) is a continuous map
f : Y → X such that for every T ∈ T , there exists an S ∈ S where f(T ) ⊆ S.
Deﬁnition 6: Let Strat be the category of topological stratiﬁed spaces and stratum-

preserving maps.

Henceforth all maps between stratiﬁed spaces are stratum-preserving.

Deﬁnition 7: A reﬁnement of (X, S) is stratiﬁed space (X, T ) such that each stratum in
S is a union of strata in T .

The underlying space of a simplicial complex is naturally stratiﬁed by its open simplices.
A subdivision of a simplicial complex is a reﬁnement of this stratiﬁed space. In this way,
a simplicial map is a stratum-preserving map with extra structure. The following technical
lemma will be useful in proving Proposition 1 and Theorem 2.

Lemma 1: [4, Theorem 15.4] Let Z be a triangulable compact space and O an open
covering. Then there is a triangulation T of Z such that every simplex in T lies in an
element of O.

3 Constructible Cosheaves

Fix a topological stratiﬁed space (X, S) and a category Ω. We require that Ω have coﬁltered
limits and arbitrary colimits. For example Ω could be Set or Vec, which are bi-complete
categories. Let Open(X) be the poset of all open sets, ordered by inclusion.

• (Gluing) For each open set U ⊆ X and each basic covering C of (U, SU), the universal

For an open set U containing x, let(cid:98)F(x ∈ U) :(cid:98)F(x) →(cid:98)F(U) be the canonical morphism
the map(cid:98)F(x ∈ U) is an isomorphism.

cosheaves valued in Ω and whose morphisms are natural transformations.

to all open sets containing x.

Remark 1: An S-constructible sheaf is a functor from the opposite of Open(X) satis-
fying dual versions of the two axioms.

4 Entrance Paths
Fix a topological stratiﬁed space (X, S). Let I = [0, 1].

Deﬁnition 11: An entrance path is a map α :(cid:0)I, T(cid:1) → (X, S) such that the dimension
convenient to write (I, T ) as(cid:0)I, {0, . . . , 1}(cid:1) where {0, . . . , 1} ⊂ T is the set of 0-strata. The

concatenation of α followed by β where β(0) = α(1) is a new entrance path β ∗ α.
Deﬁnition 12: A reparametrization of an entrance path α is an entrance path α ◦ φ,
where φ : I → I is a continuous map such that φ(0) = 0, φ(1) = 1, and t (cid:54) s implies
φ(t) (cid:54) φ(s). Note α ◦ φ is homotopic to α by φs(t) = (1 − s)φ(t) + st.

Let ∆ be the 2-simplex [v0v1v2] stratiﬁed by its vertices, edges, and face.

Deﬁnition 13: An elementary homotopy from an entrance path α : (cid:0)I, {0, 1/2, 1}(cid:1) →
(X, S) to an entrance path β :(cid:0)I, {0, 1}(cid:1) → (X, S), written α ⇒ β, is a commutative diagram

• ˜α and ˜β are simplicial maps given by ˜α(cid:0)[0, 1/2](cid:1) = [v0v1], ˜α(cid:0)[1/2, 1](cid:1) = [v1v2], and
˜β(cid:0)[0, 1](cid:1) = [v0v2]; and

(X, S),

• there is a basic open neighborhood U2 of h(v2) such that h(∆) ⊂ U2.
Note if α ⇒ β, then α(0) = β(0) and α(1) = β(1). An elementary homotopy is a
shortcutting operation. The sequence of strata visited by α is at most one longer than the
sequence visited by β.

Deﬁnition 14: We say two entrance paths α and β are elementarily related, written
α (cid:10) β, if there are reparametrizations α◦φα and β◦φβ and compositions α◦φα = α3∗α2∗α1
and β ◦ φβ = β3 ∗ β2 ∗ β1 such that α1 = β1, α2 ⇒ β2 or β2 ⇒ α2, and α3 = β3.

Figure 1: An equivalence of entrance paths is a ﬁnite number of elementary relations.

Deﬁnition 15: We say two entrance paths α and β are equivalent, written α ≈ β, if
there a ﬁnite number of elementary relations

See Figure 1.

Note ≈ is an equivalence relation on the set of all entrance paths.

Deﬁnition 16: The entrance path category Ent(X, S) has points x ∈ X as its objects
and equivalence classes of entrance paths as its morphisms.

Proposition 1: Suppose X is a manifold and S consists of a single stratum, namely the
entire manifold X. Then Ent(X, S) is equivalent to the fundamental groupoid of X.

Proof. Recall the fundamental groupoid has points as objects and homotopy classes of paths
as morphisms. Thus any path is an entrance path and vice versa. Moreover, any two
equivalent entrance paths are homotopic by deﬁnition of an equivalence. It remains to be
seen that every homotopy H : I2 → X that is constant on Hs(0) and Hs(1) is an equivalence
of entrance paths. A cover of X by open balls (i.e. basic opens) lifts to an open cover O of
I2. By Lemma 1, there is a triangulation of I2 such that each triangle maps to an open ball
in the covering. Thus H0 and H1 are equivalent entrance paths.

Remark 2: We call the opposite of the entrance path category the exit path category.

5 Van Kampen

Let Cat be the category of small categories. Recall Cat has colimits.
Deﬁnition 17: Let Ent : Strat → Cat be the functor that assigns to each (X, S) the
entrance path category Ent(X, S) and to each stratiﬁed map f : (Y, T ) → (X, S) the induced
functor Ent(f) : Ent(Y, T ) → Ent(X, S).
Theorem 1 (Van Kampen): For each topological stratiﬁed space (X, S) and for each basic
covering A ⊆ Basic(X, S), the universal functor

The set of functors {Fi} is a co-cone to the diagram Ent|A in Cat. Let

that, for each Ai ∈ A, the following diagram commutes:

This then completes the proof.
Suppose a point x ∈ X lies in Ai ∈ A. Then we must specify Q(x) = Gi(x). However, x
may belong to a second Aj ∈ A. By deﬁnition of a basic covering, there is an Ak ∈ A such
that x ∈ Ak and Ak ⊆ Ai ∩ Aj. By commutativity of Ent|A, Gi(x) = Gj(x).
Consider an entrance path α. Suppose α lies in Ai, for some Ai ∈ A. Then we must
specify Q(α) = Gi(α). However, α may belong to a second Aj ∈ A. By the same reason as
above, Gi(α) = Gj(α). Suppose α does not lie in any element of A. Then, by compactness
of I, α decomposes into a ﬁnite concatenation

α = αn ∗ ··· ∗ α1,

where each αk is an entrance path that lies in some element of A. Deﬁne

Q(α) = Q(αn) ◦ ··· ◦ Q(α1).

We check Q sends equivalence classes of entrance paths to equivalence classes of entrance
paths. It suﬃces to check that whenever α ⇒ β, Q(α) = Q(β). The map h that appears
in Deﬁnition 13 pulls-back A to an open cover B of ∆. By Lemma 1, there is a reﬁnement
∆(cid:48) with the following property: For each triangle σ ∈ ∆(cid:48), there is a B ∈ B such that σ ⊂ B.
Thus Q(α) = Q(β) by a ﬁnite number of elementary relations and each elementary homotopy
happens inside an element of A.

Proof. We construct two functors

6 Classiﬁcation

Let(cid:2)Ent(X, S), Ω(cid:3) be the category of functors F : Ent(X, S) → Ω.
Theorem 2 (Classiﬁcation): CshΩ(X, S) is equivalent to(cid:2)Ent(X, S), Ω(cid:3).
I : CshΩ(X, S) →(cid:2)Ent(X, S), Ω(cid:3)
J :(cid:2)Ent(X, S), Ω(cid:3) → CshΩ(X, S)
naturally isomorphic to the identity functor on(cid:2)Ent(X, S), Ω(cid:3).
We start with I. On objects x ∈ Ent(X, Strat), deﬁne I((cid:98)F)(x) =(cid:98)F(x). By Deﬁnition 15, it

such that J ◦ I is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor on CshΩ(X, S) and I ◦ J is

suﬃces to deﬁne I on an elementary homotopy. Recall Deﬁnition 13. Deﬁne the morphisms

I((cid:98)F)(α) :(cid:98)F(α(0)) →(cid:98)F(α(1))
/(cid:98)F(U2)
(cid:98)F(α(0)) =(cid:98)F(β(0))
(cid:98)F(α(0)∈U2) /

and I((cid:98)F)(α) :(cid:98)F(β(0)) →(cid:98)F(β(1))
/(cid:98)F(α(1)) =(cid:98)F(β(1)).

(cid:98)F−1(α(1)∈U2)

as the following composition

Now we turn to J, which assigns to each F and each U ⊆ X the object

J(F)(U) = colim (F ◦ Ent)(U, SU).

The gluing axiom follows from van Kampen. In more detail, note that for an open set U ⊆ X
and any basic covering A of (U, SU) we have, by Theorem 1,

colim J(F)|A = colim(cid:2)colim (F ◦ Ent)(A, SA)(cid:3)

∼= colim (F ◦ Ent)(X, S).

A∈A

Now we prove constructibility. Suppose V ⊆ U are two basic opens associated to a stratum
S ∈ S. Then there is an entrance path from each x ∈ U to each x(cid:48) ∈ V ∩ S. This implies a
universal morphism in the opposite direction J(F)(U) → J(F)(V). Thus J(F)(V ⊆ U) is an
(cid:9)
isomorphism.
that for each(cid:98)F and each open set U, the set of morphisms
We now describe the co-unit  : J ◦ I → idCshΩ(X,S) and prove it is an isomorphism. Note
co-cone to I((cid:98)F)|Ent(U,SU) and hence deﬁnes a universal morphism
is a
If U is a basic open then we can prove that ((cid:98)F)(U) is an isomorphism. Note that if U
is associated to a stratum S, then for every x ∈ U ∩ S we have an isomorphism I((cid:98)F)(x) =
(cid:98)F(x) → (cid:98)F(U), which, following the constructibility argument above, gives us a backwards

((cid:98)F)(U) : J ◦ I((cid:98)F)(U) = colim I((cid:98)F)|Ent(U,SU) →(cid:98)F(U).

(cid:8)(cid:98)F(x ∈ U) :(cid:98)F(x) →(cid:98)F(U)

universal morphism that induces the desired isomorphism. Now since J is a left adjoint, it
commutes with colimits and so proving the isomorphism for basic opens proves that it is an
isomorphism on arbitrary opens. Hence  is a natural isomorphism.
The unit η : id[Ent(X,S),Ω] → I ◦ J is also provided by universal properties. Given a
functor F : Ent(X, S) → Ω and a point x ∈ X, we have the universal morphism F(x) →
limU(cid:51)x{J(F)(U)}. However, the canonical morphism limU(cid:51)xJ(F)(U) → J(F)(Ux) is an iso-
morphism for any basic open Ux. Since J(F)(Ux) = colim (F ◦ Ent)(Ux, SUx) it suﬃces to
describe F(x) as a co-cone over (F ◦ Ent)(Ux, SUx). Note that the conical structure of Ux
provides an entrance path from every object in Ent(Ux, SUx) to x, which shows that F(x) is
a co-cone over (F ◦ Ent)(Ux, SUx), thereby completing the proof.
Remark 3: The classiﬁcation theorem dualizes to an equivalence between S-constructible
sheaves and functors from the exit path category.

7 Stratiﬁed Coverings

Now we describe how for Ω = Set a constructible cosheaf is equivalent to a stratiﬁed covering.
Deﬁnition 18: A stratum-preserving map f : (Y, T ) → (X, S) is a stratiﬁed covering of
(X, S) if the following holds:

8

• For each stratum S ∈ S, either the pre-image f−1(S) is empty or the restriction f|S :

f−1(S) → S of f is a covering space.

• If f takes T ∈ T to S ∈ S and there is an S(cid:48) ∈ S such that S(cid:48) ⊂ S, then there is a

T (cid:48) ∈ T such that T (cid:48) ⊂ T and f takes T (cid:48) to S(cid:48).

Deﬁnition 19: A morphism from a stratiﬁed covering f : (Y, T ) → (X, S) to a stratiﬁed
covering f(cid:48) : (Y (cid:48), T (cid:48)) → (X, S) is a stratum preserving map µ : (Y, T ) → (Y (cid:48), T (cid:48)) such that
f = f(cid:48) ◦ µ.
Deﬁnition 20: Let Cov(X, S) be the category of stratiﬁed coverings of (X, S).

One thinks of an S-constructible cosheaf (cid:98)F : Open(X) → Set as a stratiﬁed covering
f : (Y, T ) → (X, S). Each ﬁber f−1(x) is the costalk(cid:98)F(x) and each(cid:98)F(U) is π0(f−1(U)).

Theorem 3: Cov(X, S) is equivalent to CshSet(X, S).

Proof. We construct two functors

I : Cov(X, S) → CshSet(X, S)
J : CshSet(X, S) → Cov(X, S)

such that J ◦ I is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor on Cov(X, S) and I ◦ J is

naturally isomorphic to the identity functor on(cid:2)Ent(X, S), Set(cid:3).

We start with I. The functor I follows by letting I(f)(U) be the set of path connected
components of f−1(U). To see the gluing axiom, if Y is the union of open subsets Y1 and Y2,
then

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

π0(Y) ∼= colim

π0(Y1) ← π0(Y1 ∩ Y2) → π0(Y2)

.

To see constructibility, consider a basic open U of x in S. By the second property of a
stratiﬁed covering, every path component of f−1(U) has a non-empty intersection with a
unique path component of f−1(x). Thus the map π0(f−1(x)) → π0(f−1(U)) induced by
inclusion has a natural inverse.
We now assign a topology to Y. For x ∈ X, Ux ⊆ X a basic open neighborhood of x, and

We now turn to J. Fix a cosheaf(cid:98)F. Let Y =(cid:83)
y ∈(cid:98)F(x), let

The composition J◦ I preserves the ﬁbers of a stratiﬁed covering and I◦ J preserves each

set of path connected components. The two natural isomorphisms follow.

Corollary 1: Cov(X, S) is equivalent to(cid:2)Ent(X, S), Set(cid:3).

When S is a single stratum, namely all of X, Theorem 3 restricts to the classical classiﬁ-

cation of coverings spaces over a manifold.
