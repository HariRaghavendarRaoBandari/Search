We discuss a possible interpretation of the 750 GeV diphoton resonance, recently re-
ported at the LHC, within a class of Pati-Salam models with gauge coupling uniﬁcation.
The uniﬁcation is imposed by the underlying non-commutative geometry (NCG), which
in these models is extended to a left-right symmetric completion of the Standard Model
(SM). Within such uniﬁed Pati-Salam models the Higgs content is restrictively deter-
mined from the underlying NCG, instead of being arbitrarily selected as in canonical,
non-uniﬁed, Pati-Salam models. We show that the observed cross sections involving the
750 GeV diphoton resonance could be realized through a SM singlet scalar ﬁeld accompa-
nied by colored scalars, present in these uniﬁed models. In view of this result we discuss
the underlying rigidity of these models in the NCG framework and the wider implications
of the NCG approach for physics beyond the SM.

1. Introduction

After the discovery of the Higgs boson, the obvious burning question of particle
physics is: what lies beyond the completed physics of the Standard Model (SM)?
For many years, theoretical extensions of the SM have been driven by the hard
lessons learned (and perhaps prejudices acquired) in the context of eﬀective ﬁeld
theory, the underlying language of the SM. In these discussions, which include super-
symmetry, technicolor, and extra dimensions, among many others, the theoretical
motivations were rooted in deep questions such as the hierarchy problem, or the idea
of grand uniﬁcation (GUT).a More recently, growing attention has been devoted to
the underlying non-commutative geometry (NCG) of the Standard Model,b with

implications for its natural left-right symmetric completion, as discussed in Refs. 4
and 5. In the NCG framework, the SM itself harbors a GUT-like structure, and
its natural completion appears to be a GUT-like uniﬁed Pati-Salam model. The
question is: are there any hints for this uniﬁed Pati-Salam NCG framework in the
observed world, as opposed to the canonical non-restricted Pati-Salam models?1, 6–9c
Recently, ATLAS13 and CMS14 have both reported a resonance in the dipho-
ton channel with an invariant mass around 750 GeV. The local signiﬁcances were
respectively 3.6σ and 2.6σ, assuming a narrow width resonance. These signals may
be the ﬁrst hint associated with the long-anticipated physics beyond the SM. The
95% CL cross section upper limit around 750 GeV set by ATLAS (CMS) is roughly
10± 2.8 fb (6.5± 3.5 fb) using 3.2 fb−1 (2.6 fb−1) of data at
s = 13 TeV, assuming
the resonance is a scalar produced through gluon-gluon fusion. When the width of
the resonance is allowed to vary, a maximum local signiﬁcance of 3.9σ is attained
by ATLAS at a width of 45 GeV. On the other hand, the local signiﬁcance attains
its maximum for a narrow width resonance in the CMS results. Therefore, at this
stage, given these preliminary analyses, it is diﬃcult to infer conclusively whether
the width of the resonance is wide or narrow.15

√

In this letter, we discuss a possible identiﬁcation of this resonance with SM-
singlet scalars in the NCG motivated uniﬁed Pati-Salam models.4, 5 A plausible
and economical way to realize the LHC diphoton signal in the uniﬁed Pati-Salam
context is to couple this SM-singlet scalar to gluons and photons via loops of colored
scalars, as recently discussed in Ref. 16 in the context of SO(10) GUT, cf. Fig. 1. The
NCG models we consider have either an SU (2)R triplet ∆R(1, 3, 10), or an SU (2)R
dimensions of the G224 = SU (2)L × SU (2)R × SU (4)C irreducible representations.
The SM-singlet scalar S, which we identify with the 750 GeV resonance, is assumed
to be the excitation of the electrically neutral component ∆0
R1 of ∆R(1, 3, 10), or
R1 (or
R1) is also the ﬁeld that breaks the gauge symmetry of the Pati-Salam model

doublet (cid:101)∆R(1, 2, 4) in their scalar content, where the three numbers refer to the
that of (cid:101)∆R(1, 2, 4) (denoted as (cid:101)∆0
(cid:101)∆0

R1), depending on the model considered. ∆0

750 GeV diphoton excess in uniﬁed Pati-Salam models from NCG 3

to that of the SM, by acquiring a vacuum expectation value (VEV) at the scale
MC where G224 breaks to G213 = SU (2)L × U (1)Y × SU (3)C of the SM. A color-

triplet components of ∆R(1, 3, 10) (or (cid:101)∆R(1, 2, 4)) is assumed to survive down to low

energies (TeV-scale) to take on the role of the χ-ﬁeld in Fig. 1. This is but one way
that one could embed the 750 GeV diphoton resonance into the NCG Pati-Salam
framework, and we use this as a demonstrative example.

While this identiﬁcation itself is fairly straightforward, and it can already be
inferred from the similar SO(10) analysis of Ref. 16 that the cross section and width
can be made to come out in the right ballpark, the question is whether the assumed
symmetry breaking and scalar survival scenario can actually be realized in the NCG
Pati-Salam models, given the gauge-coupling-uniﬁcation requirement and restricted
scalar content which limits our ability to adjust the renormalization group running
of those couplings. Indeed, we have demonstrated in Ref. 10 that realizing a 2 TeV
WR, which had been suggested by the LHC data,17–22 in the same NCG models was
highly non-trivial due to the uniﬁcation requirement applying conﬂicting pressure
on the symmetry breaking scales. Thus, we subject our scenarios to renormalization
group equation (RGE) analyses to check their feasibilities.

The main message of this letter is that even though the 750 GeV diphoton reso-
nance can be accommodated within the NCG motivated uniﬁed Pati-Salam models,
the price one has to pay is a certain amount of ﬁne tuning in the sector involving
the necessary colored scalars. This is somewhat similar to the main message of
Ref. 10, and points to the underlying rigidity of the NCG framework. However, this
conclusion is based on eﬀective-ﬁeld-theory reasoning, which could fail in the NCG
framework due to the possible mixing between the short-distance and long-distance
physics as discussed in our previous work.10–12

This letter is organized as follows. In section 2, we present the list of the NCG
based uniﬁed Pati-Salam models that are analyzed, and discuss how the 750 GeV
diphoton resonance could be explained within their framework. In section 3, we
address the question of whether the uniﬁcation of gauge couplings can be achieved
naturally in those models. We conclude in section 4 with an outlook on the rigid
phenomenological aspects of the NCG framework. In the process, we follow the
technology discussed in our previous paper10 to which we refer the reader for further
technical details.

2. Diphoton resonance in NCG based uniﬁed Pati-Salam models

In this section, we list the three uniﬁed Pati-Salam models proposed by Chamsed-
dine, Connes, and van Suijlekom in Refs. 4 and 5, and specify how we ﬁt the diphoton
resonance into their particle content. These model emerge from an underlying NCG,
which is an extension of the NCG of the SM to that of left-right symmetric models.
The three versions diﬀer in the scalar sector content, and the unbroken symmetry
structure as listed in Table 1. We use the following notation for the symmetries:

G224D = SU (2)L ⊗ SU (2)R ⊗ SU (4)C ⊗ D ,

of an SO(10) based Pati-Salam model studied in Ref. 16, below its uniﬁcation scale
where the SO(10) had broken to G224. The scalars φ(2, 2, 1), ∆R(1, 3, 10), Σ(1, 1, 15)
are respectively obtained from the SO(10) multiplets 10 (or 120), 126, and 210.
The 210 also includes a (1, 1, 1) representation, whose VEV breaks SO(10) down
to G224.23

As in our previous paper10 we will not attempt to review the NCG foundations
of these models or to justify their derivation, but simply look at their consequences
from a purely phenomenological viewpoint in the light of the possible 750 GeV
diphoton resonance. The distinguishing feature of NCG motivated versions of the
SM2, 3 as well as its Pati-Salam completion discussed here is that they come with
GUT-like coupling uniﬁcation conditions, due to the underlying spectral action
having only one overall coupling. This is not the case for the canonical Pati-Salam
constructions found in the literature.1, 6–9

G224 to G213 is assumed for the sake of simplicityd, and also due to our experience in
Ref. 10 telling us that introducing multi-step breaking does not necessarily facilitate
the grafting of the NCG models to the SM at low energies.
In the SO(10) model of Ref. 16, the 750 GeV resonance S was identiﬁed with
the excitation of the charge neutral component ∆0
R3 of ∆R(1, 3, 10), which acquires
a VEV breaking G2213 down to G213 at MR = 5 TeV, and only one of the colored
(1,−4/3, 3), was assumed to survive below this breaking.
components, χ = ∆
This is the exact same identiﬁcation as in models B and C, except the assumed
symmetry breaking pattern is diﬀerent. Since S is a singlet under the SM gauge
group G213, it cannot directly couple to gluons or photons. The coupling is induced
by χ-loops as shown in Fig. 1. Assuming a coupling between S and χ of the form

R3

κMRSχ†χ ,

MR = 5 TeV ,

(2)
where κ is a dimensionless parameter, and Mχ > MS /2 so that S does not decay
into a χ pair, it has been shown in Ref. 16 that the LHC signal can be reproduced for
a wide range of (κ, Mχ) values around κ = O(1) and Mχ = O(1 TeV). Thus, without
repeating the analysis we conclude that our NCG models can also reproduce the
LHC signal provided a similar coupling exists between S and χ, and the assumed
particle content allows the required uniﬁcation of gauge couplings at a high scale.

3. Uniﬁcation of the couplings

As discussed in the introduction, the uniﬁcation of couplings in the NCG based Pati-
Salam models imposes non-trivial requirements on the symmetry breaking scales,
given that the scalar content of each model is restricted and cannot be changed
at will. In this section, we discuss whether the uniﬁcation of the couplings can be
achieved in the NCG based Pati-Salam models with the assumed particle content
and scalar survival assumptions. In contrast to our work in Ref. 10, we assume direct
breaking of G224 to G213 at a single scale MC, between the uniﬁcation scale MU and
the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) scale MZ. Between the scales MC and
(1,−4/3, 3)
MZ, in addition to the usual SM particle content we have the χ = ∆
ﬁeld contributing to the RGE, which we assume is the only colored scalar to survive
below MC, and possess a mass of around a TeV. The 750 GeV scalar S is an SM
singlet and consequently does not contribute to the RG running of the SM gauge
couplings.

The RG coeﬃcients, ai, diﬀer depending on the particle content in each energy
interval, changing every time symmetry breaking occurs. We will distinguish the ai’s
in diﬀerent intervals with the corresponding roman numeral superscript, cf. Eq. (4).
Together with the matching and boundary conditions of Eqs. (5), (6), (7), 1-loop
RG running leads to the following conditions on the symmetry breaking scales MU

Thus, once the RG coeﬃcients in each interval are speciﬁed, the scales MU and

meaningful, however, MU must stay below the Planck scale, and αU must be in the
perturbative regime.

3.3. Results

The particle content and the RG coeﬃcients for the three models in the two energy
intervals are listed in Tables. 3, 4, and 5. As stated above, though S survives in the
energy interval I, being an SM singlet, it does not contribute to the RG coeﬃcients.
The values of MU , MC, and αU obtained using the formalism above are listed in
Table. 6. The running of the gauge couplings for the three models are shown in
Figure 2.

We see that for all three models, MU is below the Planck scale and αU is per-
turbative, as are all the gauge coupling during their course of running. The value of
the symmetry breaking scale MC is high in the 1010∼13GeV range, suggesting that
providing S and χ = ∆
(1,−4/3, 3) with TeV scale masses, and the TeV scale
coupling κMRSχ†χ between them would involve ﬁne tuning.

4. Discussion

In this letter, we have discussed a possible interpretation of the 750 GeV diphoton
resonance in the framework of uniﬁed Pati-Salam models derived in the context
of a left-right symmetric extension of non-commutative geometry (NCG) of the
Standard Model (SM). Our framework is a grand uniﬁed version of Pati-Salam
models, within which the corresponding Higgs content is restrictively determined
(or uniquely determined for each model) from the underlying non-commutative

geometry. This should be contrasted to the regular Pati-Salam models, discussed in
the literature, in which the corresponding Higgs context is arbitrarily selected.

In this note, we have argued that the observed cross sections involving the 750
GeV diphoton resonance could be realized through a SM singlet scalar ﬁeld and
colored scalars in the NCG of uniﬁed Pati-Salam models. However the color scalars
are light and thus ﬁne tuned from the usual eﬀective ﬁeld theory point of view.
This indicates a certain rigidity of the NCG approach to the Standard Model and
its natural completion in the context of the uniﬁed Pati-Salam models. As already
emphasized, this conclusion is based on the eﬀective ﬁeld theory reasoning, which
might fail in the NCG framewrok due to the possible mixing between the short-
distance and long-distance physics as we have discussed in our previous papers
Ref. 10, as well as Refs. 11, 12. In this paper we have discussed three diﬀerent
scenarios and their implications for the physics beyond the Standard Model. We

have concentrated on the purely phenomenological aspects of the NCG uniﬁed Pati-
Salam models without relying on their deep mathematical structure or various novel
physics aspects that go beyond the eﬀective ﬁeld theory framework.

We believe that the discussion presented in this note gives extra evidence to the
underlying phenomenological rigidity of the NCG approach towards understanding
of the origins of the Standard Model and the physics beyond the Standard Model.
However, this phenomenological rigidity might be the price one has to pay for the
non-commutative nature of the approach, and it might be indicative of a possibly
exciting relation to the non-particle sector of high energy physics, that is to be
found in the context of the underlying quantum structure of space and time.
