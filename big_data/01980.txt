We investigate opinion formation against authority in an authoritarian society composed of agents with dif-
ferent levels of authority. We explore a (symbolically) “right” opinion, held by lower-ranking, obedient, less
authoritative people, spreading in an environment of a “wrong” opinion held by authoritative leaders. The men-
tal picture would be that of a corrupt society where the ruled people revolts against authority, but it could be
argued to hold in more general situations. In our model, agents can change their opinion depending on the rel-
ative authority to their neighbors and their own conﬁdence level. In addition, with a certain probability, agents
can override the authority to take the right opinion of a neighbor. Based on analytic derivation and numerical
simulations, we observe that both the network structure and heterogeneity in authority, and their correlation
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the possibility of the right opinion to spread in the population. In particular, the right opinion
is suppressed when the authority distribution is very heterogeneous and there is a positive correlation between
the authority and number of neighbors of people. Except for such extreme cases, the spreading of the right
opinion from the obedient agents takes place when there exist a tendency to override the authority to take the
right opinion, but it can take a long time depending on the model parameters. We argue that the underlying
social structure of agents sets the time scale of reaching consensus, based on the analysis of the underlying
social relations.

INTRODUCTION

How much an opinion against a ﬁrmly established author-
ity can spread in a population is an important estimate of the
population’s adaptability [1], in particular, when there exists a
strong heterogeneity in the distribution of inﬂuential power re-
garding opinion formation. In a wide view on opinion forma-
tion processes, it has been studied to reveal the hidden mecha-
nisms of a collective opinion formation on social networks [2].
There have been various opinion formation models, includ-
ing the voter model [3–6], majority rule model [7], bounded
conﬁdence model [8], and Sznajd model [9]. Many opinion
formation models have focused on the eﬀect of the hetero-
geneity in network structure for the ability to reach a global
consensus [10], and considered heterogeneous distributions
of personal characteristics—gender, age, job, economic level,
personal interests and so on [11, 12], as those two characteris-
tics are important for opinion dynamics on networks [13, 14].
However, most opinion formation models mix the concept of
heterogeneity in the individual level with structural hetero-
geneity even though structural and individual heterogeneity
can be independent to each other [15, 16]. Previous studies
derive the personal heterogeneity in inﬂuential power from
the structural heterogeneity such as the number of neighbors
(degree) [10] or PageRank [17, 18]. There have been other at-
tempts to highlight heterogeneity in individual attributes [19–
21]. However, it is also diﬀerent from overall authority dis-
persion, despite their eﬀorts to understand the emergence of
the non-inﬂuential agents’ opinion spreading. Thus, we are
still in the lack of understanding the transmission of opinions
held by non-inﬂuential agents, grounded on the heterogeneity
in both network-structural properties and inﬂuential power or

authority. From this necessity, in this paper, we investigate
the following questions: when a population is composed of
diﬀerent levels of authority of agents, how can an opinion of
obedient agents with less inﬂuential power be spread to the
whole population? How do the structure and authority collec-
tively contribute to the spreading process?

To answer these questions, we introduce a stylized opinion
formation model in a population with ﬁxed authority scores
assigned to its agents, who are connected via networks [22].
We assume heterogeneously distributed authority scores as-
signed to the agents, each of whom additionally has two char-
acteristics: an acceptance probability of right opinion and a
conﬁdence level. The acceptance probability of right opin-
ion is characterized by the parameter hinted by the experi-
ment of Milgram [23], explaining the probability against an
authoritative person’s immoral opinion. An authority compar-
ison, which agents apply on the decision process [24], occurs
as well. As an illustrative case, we assume a corrupt popu-
lation where authoritative agents have a “wrong” opinion on
a certain issue, to investigate the opinion spreading process
smeared from the obedient agents’ “right” opinion. Of course,
the notion of wrong and right opinions is purely for the sake of
argument and used as the binary alternatives in our mechanis-
tic model. It is possible to understand the result as a trend of
the opinion transmission from the obedient agents with a cer-
tain level of adherence in their opinion. We show the crucial
role of the correlation between network structure and author-
ity, via intrinsic social relations generated from the authority
comparison process. Moreover, we suggest the possibility of
the existence of a speciﬁc group which is important for pre-
serving the obedient agents’ opinion and eventually emanat-
ing it to the entire population in the most corrupt case charac-
terized with the completely bipolar initial opinions.

case of power-law distribution. The set of authority scores
is denoted as {si} for agents i ∈ {0, 1,··· , N − 1} and is go-
ing to be correlated with the agents’ degree in diﬀerent lev-
els. We assign the authority scores for each agent extracted
also from the power-law distribution form p(s) ∼ s−γ, where
the smaller γ results in more heterogeneous authority distri-
butions. We focus on the two cases γ = 2 and 3, as γ = 2 is
an important threshold for the consensus behavior that will be
presented in Sec. III. Therefore, we have two sets of power-
law distributed values: degrees {ki} characterized by the ex-
ponent λ and authority scores {si} characterized by the expo-
nent γ. We assume that the authority score and the degree can
be correlated or independent to each other. As representative
cases, we take three types of correlations: positive, zero (un-
correlated), and negative correlations. For instance, the posi-
tive correlation implies that agents with higher authority have
larger amount of network resource. To adjust the correlation
in practice, we sort both {si} and {ki} from the smallest to the
largest and match the indices of the sorted {si} with the sorted
{ki} in their exact order (i.e., the rank-based correlations = 1).
The negative correlation is achieved by the opposite way of
ordering, i.e., matching the indices using the ascending order
for {si} and the descending order for {ki}. The uncorrelated
case corresponds to the random matching.
For the sake of simplicity in our model, we assume the de-
gree and authority scores ({ki} and {si}) are not changed over
time, i.e., we assume that the time scale of opinion spread-
ing is much faster than that of the structural change of the
population. As a dynamic opinion variable, each agent i has
the time-dependent binary opinion σi(t) ∈ {0, 1} at each time
t, where we consider 1 as the “right” and 0 as the “wrong”
opinion as our convention. In our study, we assign the right
(wrong) opinion to the bottom (top) half of agents in terms of
authority, respectively, to simulate the most corrupt popula-
tion. At each time step, we randomly select a node denoted
as i and one of its neighbors j chosen randomly. With the
acceptance probability of right opinion p, agent i checks if j
has the right opinion [σ j(t) = 1]. If so, i follows j’s opinion
[σi(t + 1) = 1], regardless of i’s present opinion [σi(t)] and
the authority comparison process. Otherwise, agent i com-
pares his/her own authority with agent j’s and decides whether
agent i follows agent j’s opinion or not. The criterion is cal-
culated by their authority and the conﬁdence level α.
It is
described with q as following:

q(si, s j; α) ≡ αsi − (1 − α)s j .

(1)
If q(si, s j; α) ≥ 0, i keeps its opinion [σi(t + 1) = σi(t)].
Otherwise, agent i feels obliged to follow agent j’s opinion
[σi(t + 1) = σ j(t)]. Thus, large values of α represent stronger

FIG. 1. Snapshots of the time evolution of the model. The inte-
ger numbers inside the nodes indicate the relative rank i for author-
ity, where the larger values correspond to higher authority, which
are used as node indices in our description. The colors (red versus
green) of nodes represent their opinion, where red for right (σi = 1)
and green for wrong (σi = 0) opinions. The real numbers out-
side the nodes indicate the real authority scores si. Nodes com-
pare their authority scores by Eq. (1). For instance, node 1 chooses
node 9 for comparison (the blue edge—the same process occurs at
node 3 choosing node 7 for comparison), and takes node 9’s opinion
(σ1 = 1 → 0 and σ3 = 1 → 0) at t = 1, naturally because node 9 has
higher authority than node 1. At t = 2, node 8 chooses node 4, then
with the acceptance probability of right opinion p, regardless of their
authority scores, node 8 takes the right (σ4 = 1) opinion of node 4
(σ8 = 0 → 1).

II. MODEL

We construct a network composed of N agents as the nodes
(thus we use the terms “agent” and “node” interchangeably in
this paper), and the edges represent the relationship through
which the authority comparison and the opinion spreading oc-
cur. For network generation, we mainly use the unweighted
and undirected scale-free network (SFN) without self-loop
and multiple edges, from the conﬁguration model [25], along
with the fully connected network model to simulate the well-
mixed population.
In case of the conﬁguration model, we
generate the degree distribution following the power-law form
p(k) ∼ k−λ which yields a degree sequence {ki} for nodes or
agents i ∈ {0, 1,··· , N − 1}. We control the heterogeneity
in degree by adjusting the λ value, where the smaller λ re-
sults in more heterogeneous degree distributions. There is no
eﬀect of structural heterogeneity in the fully connected net-
work obviously and it is expected to follow the mean-ﬁeld
approach in Sec. III. We assume each agent as a subordinate
follower who is willing to follow opinions of agents with rel-
atively high authority. The comparison occurs in the network
structure that displays the interactions via the network edges.
Each agent has two global intrinsic parameters representing
individual characteristics:
the conﬁdence parameter α, and
the acceptance probability of right opinion p controlling the
probability to follow the neighbor with the correct opinion.

To express the heterogeneous authority, we generate ran-
dom numbers extracted from a power-law distribution with
the minimum value of unity, inspired by the distribution of
wealth and income, which are representatives of authority. It
is known to follow the Pareto distribution [26], the special

ﬁdence on it. Table I summarizes the rule. We believe that
the rule captures an essential psychological property revealed
by the experiment of Milgram [23]—the existence of a neigh-
bor taking the right decision is enough to drastically increase
agents’ adherence towards right opinion against the immoral
authority, even if a person alone is hard to ﬁnd such a strong
motivation to go against the authority.

III. ANALYTIC DERIVATION ON THE STABILITY

CONDITION

In this section, we derive the stability condition for the
steady state of opinions. At time t, agent i [with the authority
score si and opinion σi(t)] interacts with its random neighbor
j [with s j and σ j(t)]. Then, the agent i’s opinion at time t + 1
is determined as Table I. Assume that all of the agents are sta-
tistically equivalent and the neighbors are chosen uniformly at
random (well-mixed population). If we denote the fraction of
agents with the opinion 1 at time t as m(t), the probability of
σi(t) = 1 and that of σ j(t) = 1 are also m(t) = (cid:104)σi(t)(cid:105), where
the angular bracket denotes the agent-and-ensemble-averaged
quantity. According to Table I, with the shorthand notation
q ≡ q(si, s j; α) in Eq. (1), the probability of σi(t + 1) = 1, or
equivalently the average opinion of i is

(cid:104)σi(t + 1)(cid:105) = pm + p(1 − m)mPr[q ≥ 0] + (1 − p)m{m + (1 − Pr[q ≥ 0] − m(1 − Pr[q ≥ 0])} + (1 − p)(1 − m)mPr[q ≥ 0] ,

(2)

where we assume the independence of the current opinion and
(static) authority and Pr[q ≥ 0] denotes the probability that
the inequality q ≥ 0 holds. Rearranging all of the terms and
imposing the steady state condition (cid:104)σi(t + 1)(cid:105) = (cid:104)σi(t)(cid:105) = m,
we obtain

pmPr[q ≥ 0] = pm2Pr[q ≥ 0] ,

(3)

where replacing the instantaneous opinions σi(t) and σi(t + 1)
with the averaged opinions (cid:104)σi(t)(cid:105) = m(t) and (cid:104)σi(t + 1)(cid:105) =
m(t + 1) corresponds to our mean-ﬁeld assumption. There-
fore, for p > 0 and Pr[q ≥ 0] > 0, m = 0 or 1 (in practice,
due to the intrinsic asymmetry between 0 and 1 for p > 0, the
simulation results almost always converge to m = 1, as pre-
sented in Sec. IV), and the steady-state with 0 < m < 1 is only
possible for Pr[q ≥ 0] = 0 or p = 0.
Let us consider the explcit form of Pr[q ≥ 0]. We give the
power-law form of the authority distribution p(s) = (γ− 1)s−γ
as we mentioned in previous section, if we take smin = 1 [for
the proper normalization

When α = 1/2, Eq. (9) also gives Pr[q ≥ 0] = 1/2, a
continuation in Eq. (9). Another limiting case is α = 1, where
Pr[q ≥ 0] = 1 (agent i always beats agent j). Figure 2(a)
shows the functional form of Pr[q ≥ 0] given by Eq. (9). If
we substitute Pr[q ≥ 0] in Eq. (9) into Eq. (3), as we usually
consider γ > 1, the steady-state with 0 < m < 1 is possible for
α = 0 or p = 0, which explains the L-shaped non-transmission
region in the simulation results presented in Sec. IV.

In case of the SFN with the perfectly positive correlation
between the degree and authority, i.e., the case that the au-
thority and degree coincide, p(s j) = (γ − 1)s
should be re-
placed with p(s j) = (γ − 2)s1−γ

ing a neighbor will be proportional to the neighbor’s authority

One can also check the continuation in Eq. (10) at α = 1/2.
Figure 2(b) shows the functional form of Pr[q ≥ 0] given by
Eq. (10). The stability condition for 0 < m < 1 requiring
α = 0 or p = 0, therefore, is not aﬀected by the correlated
network, as long as γ > 2. For γ ≤ 2, things get tricky as the
distribution p(s j) itself cannot be properly normalized (so we
will need an extra cutoﬀ like an exponential tail). For instance,
as γ → 2+, Pr[q ≥ 0] → 0 according to Eq. (10) [γ = 2.01 in
Fig. 2(b)], implying that the 0 < m < 1 stable state is possible
for any α(< 1) and p values. This illustrates the situation that
spreading of the right opinion can be severely suppressed by
the dominating hubs (with large degree and authority at the
same time).
For the negative correlation, let us consider the case si ∝
−1−γ
1/ki where ki is the degree of node i. Then, p(s j) = γs
j
(the probability of being chosen as one’s neighbor is inversely
proportional to the neighbor’s authority), which gives

In this case, Pr[q ≥ 0] > 1/2 for α = 1/2, implying that
“your neighbor is weaker than you” (the “inverse” friendship
paradox) [15, 16]. Figure 2(c) shows the functional form of
Pr[q ≥ 0] given by Eq. (11). Unlike the positive correlation
case, Pr[q ≥ 0] = 0 only at α = 0 as γ > 1, so the stability
condition is the same as the uncorrelated network case (α = 0
or p = 0 for the 0 < m < 1 stability). Possible ﬁnite-size
eﬀects will be more severe for α (cid:28) 1 with large γ, where the
α value small enough to make Pr[q ≥ 0] (cid:39) 0, which is indeed
observable from the results in Sec. IV: wider boundary straps

on the horizontal axes. The assumption si ∝ 1/ki is techni-
cally diﬀerent from our negative correlation case in Sec. II,
where we just use the inverse order between {si} and {ki}, but
we believe that the stability condition will be the same, based
on the robustness of the condition from the uncorrelated to
inversely correlated cases described in this section.

the fraction of agents with the right opinion [σν;i(t) = 1], as
σν;i(t) ∈ {0, 1}. If the opinions in the network do not change
for the tc consecutive time steps, we consider that the popu-
lation reaches a steady state and record the time to reach the
steady state τs (this is distinguished from the consensus time
τ when there is no active edges connecting the agents with
diﬀerent opinions for the ﬁrst time, i.e., the system reaches an
absorbing state). The average opinion mν(t) over the agents is

The realizations that reach consensus are divided into the right

the fraction of the former is denoted as fR.

We numerically investigate the eﬀect of the degree dis-
tribution p(k) and heterogeneous authority with the individ-

ual characteristics (the conﬁdence level α and the acceptance
probability of right opinion p) for the transmission of the right
opinion of agents with low authority in SFN. We ﬁrst study the
eﬀect of the heterogeneity represented by γ in the whole per-
sonal characteristic parameter space (p ∈ [0, 1], α ∈ [0, 1]).
As described in Sec. II, we compare γ = 2 and 3 cases for
the diﬀerent heterogeneity, with the no, positive, and negative
correlations between {ki} and {si}. Figure 4 shows the results.
For our simulation, the number of agents N = 100, n = 5000,
and tc = 50 (in the unit of Monte Carlo steps), unless other-
wise stated, for each (p, α) parameter combination.

A. Phase separation and consensus time

Figure 3 shows the result of the fully connected network
case where only the authority heterogeneity matters, where
the L-shaped boundary is consistent with our mean-ﬁeld cal-
culation in Sec. III, as expected. Again, as remarked in
Sec. III, even if both m = 0 and m = 1 absorbing states are
possible, due to the intrinsic asymmetry favoring m = 1 for
p > 0, one can see that it is extremely likely that the system
converges to the m = 1 absorbing state, not the other one. The
results of γ = 2 and γ = 3 (remember that the γ exponent
controls the heterogeneity of the authority, not the network
structure) describe the boundary on the axis even though the
non-transmission of the right opinion (= 1) area in γ = 3 is
larger than the γ = 2 case. This ﬁnite-size eﬀect is also antici-
pated from the discussion in Sec. III; a more severe ﬁnite-size
eﬀect characterized by the wider boundary straps on the hori-
zontal axis for γ = 3 is expected from the functional form of
Pr[q ≥ 0] plotted in Fig. 2(a), where the larger γ values induce
more rapid decreasing Pr[q ≥ 0] as α → 0.
For the SFN cases, we set the degree distribution exponent
λ [in p(k) ∼ k−λ] equal to the authority heterogeneity expo-
nent γ [in p(s) ∼ s−γ], to compare with the analytic result in
Sec. III. In other words, the γ value controls the heterogene-
ity in both authority and degree distribution with the same
functional form. We generate {si} for the authority and the
degree sequence {ki} drawn from the same power-law form
p(s) ∼ s−γ and p(k) ∼ k−γ, respectively, with the minimum
values of smin = 1 for authority and kmin = 2 for the degree se-
quence to ensure the connectivity. As described in Sec. II, we
sort both the authority scores and the degree sequence. Then,
we match them in the exact order for the positive correlation.
For the uncorrelated case, we randomly match {si} and {ki},
and we match them in the inverse order in the negative corre-
lation case. The SFN results from the uncorrelated and neg-
atively correlated cases shown in Figs. 4(a), (b), (d), and (e)
also match well with our analytic derivation in Sec. III. The
L-shaped phase boundary is clearly shown, as our derivation
predicts. The negative correlation case also shows similar L-
shaped boundary [Figs. 4(a) and (d)], but the average opinion
values are about twice as large as the uncorrelated case, or the
sharper boundary than the uncorrelated case. Similar to the
fully connected case discussed in the previous paragraph, the
wider boundary straps on the horizontal axes for γ = 3 with
the uncorrelated and negatively correlated cases is expected

6
from the functional form of Pr[q ≥ 0], shown in Figs. 2(a) and
(c).

The successful transmission (i.e., the right opinion prevails)
area increases with the increase of γ only in the positive cor-
relation case [Figs. 4(c) and (f)] because of the stability of
0 < m < 1 for γ = 2 as we have shown analytically in Sec. III,
while the tendency is the opposite for the negatively corre-
lated and uncorrelated cases due to the wider boundary straps
near the horizontal axis as discussed. Larger γ values imply
more homogeneous degree distributions or the reduction of
the hub eﬀect. The increase of the heterogeneity in the degree
distribution can increase the transmission of the right opin-
ion because agents with low authority have a larger chance to
deliver their opinion via their larger degree values in the nega-
tively correlated case. In short, the heterogeneity in the degree
distribution enlarges the successful transmission area, and in
turn, provides much larger probability to the right opinion in
the uncorrelated and negatively correlated cases.

A diﬀerent pattern arises in the positive correlation case—
see Figs. 4(c) and (f). There are boundary curves diﬀerent
from the L-shape, which makes the nontrivial amount of non-
transmission area of the right opinion (0 < m < 1). Two dif-
ferent personal characteristics play diﬀerent roles in diﬀerent
heterogeneity structures in terms of the authority and degree
distribution, i.e., p plays a crucial role for severe heterogene-
ity, while α does for more homogeneous structure. When the
structure is severely heterogeneous (γ = 2), m is close to zero
in small p region (p (cid:46) 0.5) even when α is large. In contrast,
the transmission region is considerably larger for small p at
γ = 3. We can deduce the crucial role of the conﬁdence level
α of individuals in the positive correlation condition, and the
case γ = 2 [Fig. 4(c)] coincides with our derivation in Sec. III
where the nontrivial stable solution 0 < m < 1 is possible. We
believe that the deviation from the analytic derivation (that
predicts the L-shape even for the positive correlation case) for
the γ = 3 is a ﬁnite-size eﬀect. From this result, we conclude
that the conﬁdence level α plays a salient role with increased
homogeneity, and a small change in the acceptance probabil-
ity of right opinion p yields dramatic diﬀerences in severely
heterogeneous structures.

We present the analysis on the consensus time τ for the pos-
itive correlation, as the positive correlation case is prevalent
in our society [15, 16]. The consensus time for opinion dy-
namics is an important parameter to investigate the temporal
scale of the consensus process in details and its divergence
signiﬁes the dynamic phase transition [27]. We average the
consensus time over n = 500 independent simulations. The
consensus time τ shown in Fig. 5 describes an opportunity
cost for the transmission of the right opinion: a larger trans-
mission probability requires longer consensus time. Appar-
ently, there is a conﬁdence level αmax with which the simula-
tion takes the longest consensus time τ, depending on the p
values and system heterogeneity. As shown in Figs. 5(a) and
(c), τ has the clear maximum point for small p < 0.5. The
maximum point is located at αmax = 0.6 for γ = 2, slightly
larger than αmax = 0.5 at γ = 3. Figures 5(b) and (d) describe
another side of the consensus. The fraction of right consensus
fR at consensus time(τ), deﬁned in Sec. II for α > αmax), is

The results are from 500 independent realizations in diﬀerent heterogeneity (γ = 2 and 3) with the positive correlation. For γ = 2, we present
(a) τ and (b) fR. We present the γ = 3 result in panels (c) τ and (d) fR. The lines are the guide to the eyes. The symbols are located at the mean

close to unity in larger α than maximum α (αmax, for γ = 2,
αmax = 0.6, for γ = 3, αmax = 0.5). Each structure shares this
same tendency even though γ = 2 requires larger α values and
varies more in fR for small p < 0.5. In short, the transmis-
sion of the opinion of agents with low authority takes more
time (large τ) and requires higher conﬁdence level (large α),
for the case of scant sense of the acceptace of right opinion
(small p) and large heterogeneity (small γ).

B.

Internal dynamics of opinion transmission

So far, we have presented the eﬀects of heterogeneity in
structural characteristics. In particular, the conﬁdence param-

eter α plays a signiﬁcant role for τ and fR with the small p.
In this subsection, we investigate more detailed opinion trans-
mission dynamics in terms of the maximum consensus time
and subgroups of agents. For that purpose, we explore the
underlying structure of comparison process happening in the
network. We claim that the large τ values are in fact caused
by the social ties representing the comparison processes in
Eq. (1), illustrated in Fig. 6. Although the substrate network
constructed at the initial stage of the model is undirected, the
agent relations for the comparison process have an intrinsic
directionality. Consider nodes 2 and 5 in Fig. 6(a). The au-
thority scores are s2 = 1.28 and s5 = 1.83, respectively. As
q(s2, s5; α = 0.3) < 0 and q(s5, s2; α = 0.3) < 0 from Eq. (1),
the opinion can spread in both directions (node 2 → node 5

and node 5 → node 2) for α = 0.3, represented as a bidirec-
tional edge between the two nodes in Fig. 6(b). In contrast,
q(s2, s5; α = 0.6) > 0 and q(s5, s2; α = 0.6) > 0, so no opin-
ion transmission can occur between the two nodes in any di-
rection for α = 0.6, represented as the absence of an edge
between the two nodes in Fig. 6(c). A unidirectional relation
is also possible. When we consider nodes 1 with s1 = 1.06
and 6 with s6 = 2.29 in Fig. 6(a), q(s1, s6; α = 0.3) > 0 and
q(s6, s1; α = 0.3) > 0, which corresponds to the social struc-
ture for α = 0.3 [Fig. 6(b)]. However, as q(s1, s6; α = 0.6) < 0
and q(s6, s1; α = 0.6) > 0, only (node 6 → node 1) remains
for α = 0.6 [Fig. 6(b)].

The structural change in dynamics is characterized by the
analysis on the connected components. As one can see from
the connected components in Figs. 6(b) versus (c), an impor-
tant transition analogous to the percolation transition occurs
somewhere in between. In that example, node 2 becomes iso-
lated from the giant component (GC) for the transmission net-
work (for simplicity, we neglect the directionality for the con-
nected component analysis), so there is no way to change its
opinion through the comparison process, which is main dy-
namics, and it is possible only for choosing the right opinion
regardless of the authority comparison with the parameter p.
Therefore, we suggest that such a qualitative change in the
social structure explains the consensus time depending on α.
In other words, the intrinsic asymmetry in our model yields
such asymmetric social relations. Depending on α, signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent social structures emerge. In practice, we take
the fraction of GC S GC = NGC/N (where NGC is the number
of agents belonging to the giant component) as the level of
separation in social structure—see Figs. 5(a) and (c). We ﬁnd
that αmax is located near the transition point of the GC size.

C. Opinion spreading behavior for diﬀerent authority level

As we have shown in the previous subsection, the con-
nected component analysis from the relative authority high-
lights its importance in opinion spreading in our model. In

8

this subsection, we observe the evolution of opinion for each
authority group. To elaborate on diﬀerent authority groups,
we observe the average opinion mi(t) for each authority index
i ∈ {0, 1,··· , N−1} (sorted as larger numbers represent higher
authority, for natural notational convenience in this section)
as a function of time. Interestingly, there are certain authority
groups that “protect” the right opinion for a long time—see
Figs. 7(a) and (b). We present the result with a low level of
the acceptance probability of right opinion p = 0.1, because
the large p values screen the eﬀect of diﬀerence in rank i. For
the comparison of diﬀerent levels of transmission, we choose
α = 0.3 and 0.8 for γ = 2, α = 0.3 and 0.6 for γ = 3, based on
the result shown in Fig. 5. Compared to the suppressed cases
(the wrong opinion prevails) shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d), there
are speciﬁc groups to keep the right opinion for the right con-
sensus cases shown in Figs. 7(a) and (b). To be more speciﬁc,
the agents around i = 20 and 40 for γ = 2 and those around
i = 30 for γ = 3 play such a role of “reservoir” for the opinion
transmission. Those groups start to recover the right opinion
faster, and it seems that they are primers for the transmission
of the right opinion to outside.

To identify the role of those groups further, we illustrate
the snapshots of opinion formation for the γ = 3 case in
Fig. 8. Figure 8(a) displays the initial condition of the fol-
lowship structure described in Sec. IV B with α = 0.6. The
lower authority group from i = 0 to 49 has the right opinion
and the other half from i = 50 to 99 has the wrong opinion.
The wrong opinion quickly spreads out through the network
in short time (t < 102)—see Fig. 8(b). However, the left-
over nodes with the right opinion can keep the right opinion
because they have a rare chance to be invaded by the higher
authority nodes with the wrong opinion, in the social struc-
ture discussed in Sec. IV B. As keeping their opinion, ﬁnally,
the nodes with the right opinion have an opportunity to de-
liver their right opinion from a certain time step. Once the
right opinion is delivered to the high authority node as shown
in Fig. 8(c), it diﬀuses through a large degree and strong in-
ﬂuential impact, as shown in Figs. 8(d), (e), and (f). For the
network with strong hierarchical tendency with α = 0.6, com-
pared to the α = 0.3 case, the right opinion is rapidly trans-
mitted to the whole network right after it is delivered to high
authority nodes.

In general, the low authority nodes are aﬀected by the high
authority nodes. However, the social structures [such as the
one in Fig. 8 for α = 0.6 (p = 0.1, γ = 3)] include some “iso-
lated” nodes from the main GC with the right opinion. Addi-
tionally, the nodes in the speciﬁc opinion reservoir group have
relatively large chance to be isolated. It is represented as fs for
both γ (Fig. 9). Only if the isolated nodes keep the right opin-
ion, the right opinion can survive for a long time. Besides, the
opinion reservoir nodes can use their original undirected links,
connected to both low and high authority nodes, to spread out
their right opinion by p. In this way, they play the role of the
reservoir for the right opinion. When the protected opinion by
the opinion reservoir group is the right one, the low authority
agents’ right opinion can spread in the entire population even
for the case of a low acceptance probability p. Our results
again show that the conﬁdence level of one’s own opinion is

important. Moreover, we have found that the comparison pro-
cess can eﬀectively generate zealous groups by heterogeneous
authority, even though agents have the same principle for the
decision of an opinion.

We emphasize that one has to be careful about the interpre-
tation of the result reported in this subsection, as it is likely
that the existence of such a speciﬁc group is related to our
particular choice of initial opinion distribution: the wrong and
right opinions are strictly divided by the authority scores. In
Figs. 7(a) and (b), vertically correlated patterns seem to be
smeared from the opinion dichotomy in the very beginning
indeed.

D. Eﬀect of the initial opinion distribution and system size

Finally, we remark on the eﬀect of the initial opinion distri-
bution in our model, as our “corrupt population” model might
be seen as too extreme a case to draw conclusions. However,
one can already see that the stability condition discussed in
Sec. III is derived regardless of the initial opinion distribution,

and we indeed check that randomly distributed initial opinions
(each agent’s opinion is randomly chosen regardless of the au-
thority scores) do not change our numerical results such as the
phase diagram in Fig. 4. In fact, our original initial condition
where the most authoritative agents have the wrong opinion
is the harshest condition for opinion spreading from obedient
agents, so our conclusion that any nonzero values of p and α
yield the eventual takeover (for most cases) of the right opin-
ion of obedient agents would hold in milder conditions, e.g.,
randomly distributed initial opinions. One particular result
that does depend on the initial condition indeed is the exis-
tence of the opinion reservoir group discussed in Secs. IV B
and IV C, as we discover that the randomly distributed ini-
tial opinions wipe out such authority-based speciﬁc opinion
groups. Although the main results presented in this paper are
mostly from N = 100, we check that the results hold for larger
system sizes up to about ten times as large as that. Therefore,
we believe that the results reported in this paper are intact for
even larger system sizes, combined with our analytic argu-
ment.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

We have introduced a stylized opinion formation model to
understand the transmission of the low authority agents’ opin-
ion by setting an independent individual attributes such as the
conﬁdence level, the acceptance probability of right opinion,
authority, and structural characteristics, in a population with
dichotomous opinions. We have demonstrated how the level
of heterogeneity in network structure and authority, and their
correlation patterns aﬀect the transmission probability. We
have conﬁrmed the crucial role of the conﬁdence level for the
transmission even for the case of the scarce sense of the ac-
ceptance probability of the right opinion. Even the slightly
increased conﬁdence level can cause the dramatic increase of
the possibility in prevalence of the opinion from agents with
low authority.

In addition, speciﬁc authority groups can play a vital role to
protect the right opinion and spread it, in the case of the most
corrupt population we have examined. Only if the groups, de-
noted as the opinion reservoir, have the right opinion from the
agents with less authority, a population has a large chance for
the transmission of the opinion of less authority. The opin-
ion reservoir groups are generated by the comparison pro-

11

cess in heterogeneous authority distribution. It gives us a hint
for a generation of zealots which have studied intensively for
the role of heterogeneous node characteristics [28–30]. Even
though our binary opinion model is highly simpliﬁed one, we
believe that the conclusion from our study will hold for more
general cases. If a population has a will to hear low authority
agents’ opinion, there is a chance for the opinion to be deliv-
ered to entire population. Moreover, if the conﬁdence of each
agent is higher than a certain level, the transmission could oc-
curs through the speciﬁc opinion reservoir group. The future
work may include more realistic network structures such as
the networks with communities. As communities are meso-
scopic units of our society, we can see how the community
structure makes a change for opinion spreading in an authori-
tarian population.
