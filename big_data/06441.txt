Which small reaction networks are multistationary?

Badal Joshi and Anne Shiu

March 21, 2016

Abstract

Reaction networks taken with mass-action kinetics arise in many settings, from epidemiology
to population biology to systems of chemical reactions. Bistable reaction networks are posited
to underlie biochemical switches, which motivates the following question: which reaction net-
works have the capacity for multiple steady states? Mathematically, this asks: among certain
parametrized families of polynomial systems, which admit multiple positive roots? No complete
answer is known. This work analyzes the smallest networks, those with only a few chemical
species or reactions. We completely answer the question of multistationarity and, in some cases,
multistability too, thereby extending related work of Boros. Our results highlight the role played
by the Newton polytope of a network (the convex hull of the reactant vectors). Also, our work
is motivated by recent results that explain how a given network’s capacity for multistationarity
arises from that of certain related networks which are typically smaller. Hence, we are interested
in classifying small multistationary networks, and our work forms a ﬁrst step in this direction.

Introduction

Many dynamical systems that arise in applications admit multiple steady states, and yet the
following question is open:

Question 1.1. When taken with mass-action kinetics, which reaction networks have the capacity
for two or more steady states?

Mathematically, Question 1.1 asks: among certain parametrized families of polynomial systems,
which of them admit multiple positive solutions? This question remains open, even as related
questions have been resolved. For instance, Banaji and Pantea proved that, when taken with
certain power-law kinetics, a network that contains all inﬂows/outﬂows has the capacity for two
or more steady states if and only if its non-ﬂow subnetwork is “accordant” [2, Corollary 4.26].
Question 1.1 is the ﬁrst step toward classifying bistable networks, which are thought to
underlie biochemical switches. Much prior work has analyzed bistability in speciﬁc networks
arising in systems biology (e.g., [5, 16, 21, 22, 23, 36, 37]), but we would also like to develop
theory that applies to general families of networks. Here we succeed in obtaining such results.
Speciﬁcally, the aim of the present work is to completely answer Question 1.1 for small
networks, those with only 1 chemical species or up to 2 chemical reactions (each of which is
possibly reversible). Moreover, deciding multistationarity for these networks will be immediate
from inspecting their “reaction diagrams” (which depict, for instance, the reaction A → B as
an arrow from (1, 0) to (0, 1)). Here we informally summarize some of our main results:

Theorem 1.2 (Informal). Let G be a reaction network with exactly r reactions and s species.

1. If s = 1, then G is nondegenerately multistationary if and only if G has a subnetwork of

the form “→←→” (e.g., 0 → A ← 2A, 3A → 4A) or “←→←”.

1

2. If r = 1, then G is not multistationary. If r = 2, then G is nondegenerately multistationary
if and only if for some choice of species i and j, the projection of the reaction diagram to
the (i, j)-plane has one of the following zigzag forms (depicted also is the rectangle whose
diagonal joins the two reactants):

and, if only one such pair (i, j) exists, then the slope of the marked diagonal is not −1.

For a precise statement of Theorem 1.2, see Theorems 3.7 and 5.2.

In addition to taking a step toward answering Question 1.1, our goal of cataloging small
multistationary networks is motivated by recent results on how a given network’s capacity for
multistationarity arises from that of certain smaller networks. Here is one such “lifting” result,
stated informally:
if N is a subnetwork of G and both networks contain all possible inﬂow
and outﬂow reactions, then if N is multistationary then G is too. Therefore, we would like a
catalogue of small multistationary networks against which the networks N can be checked.

We began such a catalogue for those networks containing all inﬂows and outﬂows in [29],
and then for general networks in [30]. The present work adds to this second list. Speciﬁcally,
we ﬁnd new embedding-minimal multistationary networks (embedded networks are obtained by
removing species, as we saw earlier, and/or reactions; see Section 2.4):

Theorem 1.3. Among all networks G that have exactly 1 species or that are subnetworks of a

multistationary ones are precisely the following:

2-reversible-reaction network (i.e., {y → y′} ⊆ G ⊆ {y ⇆ y′, ey ⇆ey′}), the embedding-minimal

1. the 1-species networks of the form “→←→” or “←→←”,

2. the 2-species, 2-reaction networks whose reaction diagram has one of the following forms:

and the slope of the marked diagonal is not −1, and

3. the 3-species networks for which there are two pairs of species, denoted {i1, j1} and {i2, j2},
such that (for k = 1, 2) the projection of the reaction diagram to the (ik, jk)-plane has one
of the following forms:

and the slope of the marked diagonal equals −1.

Theorem 1.3 summarizes Corollaries 3.12, 4.11, 5.6, 5.11, and 5.16.

Although we are the ﬁrst to propose a catalogue of small multistationary networks, there
are some related analyses of small networks. Horn initiated the investigation of small chemical
reaction networks by enumerating networks that consist of a few “short complexes” (at-most-
bimolecular) [24, 25]. Networks that consist of at most three short complexes do not admit
multiple steady states. Deckard et al. enumerated networks (with certain restrictions) with few
reactions and species. Sampling from this enumeration, Pantea and Craciun [33] estimated the
percentage of small networks (containing all inﬂows/outﬂows) for which the injectivity criterion
of Craciun and Feinberg [7] precludes multistationarity. Wilhelm and Heinrich found and ana-
lyzed the smallest networks admitting bistability or Hopf bifurcations [38, 39, 40]; see also [35].
In earlier work, the present authors analyzed the smallest multistationary networks that are
mass-preserving [34], and also those that contain all inﬂows/outﬂows plus one or two non-ﬂow
reactions involving at-most-bimolecular chemical complexes [27, 29].

Another related work is a recent paper of Boros [4], which our work uses and extends.
Boros used Feinberg’s deﬁciency one algorithm to classify small multistationary networks, more
speciﬁcally, certain ‘regular’ networks with only one species or up to two reactions (possibly

2

reversible and allowing ﬂow reactions as well). Boros considered only regular networks because
the deﬁciency one algorithm applies to those ones only. Our work analyzes many of the same
networks, without requiring them to be regular. Moreover, like Boros, we elucidate the precise
conditions for multistationarity, but also go beyond, to ascertain nondegenerate multistationar-
ity and bistability as well. For instance, we will see that networks with only two reactions and
two species may admit up to two nondegenerate steady states, but only one is stable (Theo-
rem 4.8). Additionally, compared to Boros’s, our criteria for multistationarity are simpler, and
we also interpret them geometrically via reaction diagrams (as in the above theorems).

In addition to applying Boros’s results, we also rely on existing criteria from chemical re-
action network theory [12, 26] (speciﬁcally, deﬁciency theory) that can preclude or guarantee
multistationarity for certain classes of networks. Indeed, these criteria can be viewed as the ﬁrst
partial answers to Question 1.1. For a survey, see [30].

Besides using standard criteria from chemical reaction network theory, we also employ con-
cepts (e.g., Newton polytopes) and basic results (e.g., Descartes’ rule of signs) from real al-
gebraic geometry. This is unsurprising: Question 1.1 and related problems are algebraic in
nature [10, 20], and criteria for real root counting are in terms of signs [3]. Accordingly, criteria
for deciding multistationarity based on sign conditions have a long history [2, 13, 31].

In particular, we highlight the role of Newton polytopes and their geometric relationships
to the reaction vectors of a network. The Newton polytope (or “reactant polytope”) we are
interested in is the convex hull of the reactant (source) vectors. For instance, for the network
{A + 2B → 3B, 3A + B → 4A}, the polytope is the marked diagonal of the rectangle below:

3B

A + 2B

3A + B

4A

As an example, the above reaction diagram does not match any of the four forms depicted in
Theorem 1.2 (part 2), so we immediately conclude that the network is not multistationary.

For readers already familiar with real algebraic geometry, it is no surprise that these ge-
ometric objects appear in our analyses. Additionally, for someone familiar with the ideas in
Craciun’s recent proof of (and others’ prior partial results toward) the so-called global attractor
conjecture [1, 6, 8, 18, 32], it is well known that analyzing the Netwon polytope of a network
elucidates some aspects of the long-term dynamics and can be used to determine whether the
network always admits at least one positive steady state. What is new here is our use of the
geometric objects to determine whether a network admits more than one positive steady state.
Our work is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces chemical reaction networks and the
dynamical systems they deﬁne. Section 3 completes the simplest cases: when a network has only
one species or only one reaction. There we also show the following: letting r denote the number
of reactions and s the number of species, the nondegenerately multistationary networks always
satisfy the inequality r + s ≥ 4. Section 4 treats the next case: networks with two reactions and
two species, and then Section 5 extends these results to arbitrary networks with two reactions,
each of which is possibly reversible. Finally, a discussion appears in Section 6.

2 Background

In this section we recall how a chemical reaction network gives rise to a dynamical system.

We begin with an example of a chemical reaction: A + B → 3A + C.

In this reaction,
one unit of chemical species A and one of B react to form three units of A and one of C.
The reactant A + B and the product 3A + C are called complexes. The concentrations of
the three species, denoted by xA, xB, and xC , change in time as the reaction occurs. Under
the assumption of mass-action kinetics, species A and B react at a rate proportional to the

3

product of their concentrations, where the proportionality constant is the reaction rate constant
κ. Noting that the reaction yields a net change of two units in the amount of A, we obtain the
diﬀerential equation d
dt xB = −κxAxB and
d
dt xC = κxAxB. A chemical reaction network consists of ﬁnitely many reactions (Deﬁnition 2.1).
The mass-action diﬀerential equations that a network deﬁnes consist of a sum of the monomial
contributions from the reactants of each chemical reaction in the network (see (2)).

dt xA = 2κxAxB, and the other two arise similarly: d

2.1 Chemical reaction systems

We now provide precise deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A chemical reaction network G = (S, C, R) consists of three ﬁnite sets:

1. a set of chemical species S = {A1, A2, . . . , As},
2. a set C = {y1, y2, . . . , yp} of complexes (ﬁnite nonnegative-integer combinations of the

species), and

3. a set of reactions, which are ordered pairs of the complexes, excluding the diagonal pairs:

R ⊆ (C × C) \ {(y, y) | y ∈ C}.

A subnetwork of a network G = (S, C, R) is a network G′ = (S′, C′, R′) with R′ ⊆ R.

In this work, p, s, and r denote the numbers of complexes, species, and reactions, respectively.
We may view a network as a directed graph: the nodes are complexes, and the edges corre-
spond to reactions. A linkage class is a connected component of the directed graph: complexes y
and y′ are in the same linkage class if there is a sequence of complexes (y0 := y, y1, . . . , yn := y′)
such that yi → yi+1 or yi+1 → yi is a reaction for all 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. A network is weakly re-
versible if every connected component is strongly connected, i.e., every reaction is part of a
directed cycle of reactions. A reaction yi → yj is reversible if its reverse reaction yj → yi is also
in R; such a pair is depicted by yi ⇋ yj.

Writing the i-th complex as yi1A1 + yi2A2 + · · · + yisAs (where yij ∈ Z≥0 for j = 1, 2, . . . , s),

we introduce the following monomial:

xyi

:= xyi1

1 xyi2

2

· · · xyis

s

.

For example, the two complexes in the reaction A + B → 3A + C considered earlier give rise to
the monomials xAxB and x3
AxC , which determine the vectors y1 = (1, 1, 0) and y2 = (3, 0, 1).
These vectors deﬁne the rows of a p × s-matrix of nonnegative integers, which we denote by
Y = (yij). Next, the unknowns x1, x2, . . . , xs represent the concentrations of the s species in
the network, and we regard them as functions xi(t) of time t.

For a reaction yi → yj from the i-th complex to the j-th complex, the reaction vector
yj − yi encodes the net change in each species that results when the reaction takes place. The
stoichiometric matrix Γ is the s × r matrix whose k-th column is the reaction vector of the k-th
reaction i.e., it is the vector yj − yi if k indexes the reaction yi → yj.

We associate to each reaction a positive parameter κij, the rate constant of the reaction. In
this article, we will treat the rate constants κij as positive unknowns in order to analyze the
entire family of dynamical systems that arise from a given network as the κij ’s vary.

The choice of kinetics is encoded by a locally Lipschitz function R : Rs

≥0 → Rr that encodes
the reaction rates of the r reactions as functions of the s species concentrations. The reaction
kinetics system deﬁned by a reaction network G and reaction rate function R is given by the
following system of ODEs:

dx
dt

= Γ · R(x) .

(1)

For mass-action kinetics, which is the setting of this paper, the coordinates of R are Rk(x) =
κij xyi, if k indexes the reaction yi → yj. A chemical reaction system refers to the dynamical
system (1) arising from a speciﬁc chemical reaction network (S, C, R) and a choice of rate

4

parameters (κ∗
>0 (recall that r denotes the number of reactions) where the reaction rate
function R is that of mass-action kinetics. Speciﬁcally, the mass-action ODEs are the following:

ij) ∈ Rr

dx
dt

=

Xyi→yj is in R

κij xyi(yj − yi) =:

fκ(x) .

(2)

The stoichiometric subspace is the vector subspace of Rs spanned by the reaction vectors

yj − yi, and we will denote this space by S:

S := R{yj − yi | yi → yj is in R} .

(3)

Note that S = im(Γ), where Γ is the stoichiometric matrix. For the network consisting of the
single reaction A + B → 3A + C, we have y2 − y1 = (2, −1, 1), which spans S for this network.
dt in (1) lies in S for all time t. In fact, a trajectory x(t) beginning at

Note that the vector dx

a positive vector x(0) = x0 ∈ Rs

>0 remains in the following stoichiometric compatibility class:

for all positive time. In other words, P is forward-invariant with respect to the dynamics (1).

P := (x0 + S) ∩ Rs

≥0

(4)

2.2 Steady states

A steady state of a reaction kinetics system is a nonnegative concentration vector x∗ ∈ Rs
≥0 at
which the ODEs (1) vanish: fκ(x∗) = 0. A steady state x∗ is nondegenerate if Im (dfκ(x∗)) = S.
(Here, dfκ(x∗) is the Jacobian matrix of fκ at x∗.) A nondegenerate steady state is exponentially
stable if each of the σ := dim(S) nonzero eigenvalues of dfκ(x∗) has negative real part. This
work focuses on counting positive steady states x∗ ∈ Rs

>0.

Deﬁnition 2.2.

1. A reaction kinetics system (1) is multistationary (or admits multiple pos-
itive steady states) if there exists a stoichiometric compatibility class (4) with two or more
positive steady states. Similarly, a reaction kinetics system is nondegenerately multista-
tionary (respectively, multistable) if it admits two or more nondegenerate (respectively,
exponentially stable) positive steady states in some stoichiometric compatibility class (4).

2. Under mass-action kinetics (2), a network may admit multiple positive steady states for
all, some, or no choices of positive rate constants κij; if such rate constants exist, then
the network itself has the capacity for multistationarity or, for short, is multistationary.
Analogously, a network can be nondegenerately multistationary or multistable.

3. A network admits k positive steady states if there exists a choice of positive rate constants
so that the resulting mass-action system has exactly k positive steady states in some
stoichiometric compatibility class. Similarly, a network may admit k nondegenerate positive
steady states or admit k exponentially stable positive steady states.1

4. The maximum number of positive steady states of a network G is

cappos(G) := max{k ∈ Z≥0 ∪ ∞ | G admits k positive steady states} .

The maximum number of nondegenerate positive steady states of a network G is

capnondeg(G) := max{k ∈ Z≥0 ∪ ∞ | G admits k nondegenerate positive steady states} ,

which we also call the the capacity of G. Analogously, G has a maximum number of
exponentially stable positive steady states, denoted by capexp-stab(G).

1We allow k = ∞, by which we mean inﬁnitely many steady states of the corresponding type.

5

Note that a network G is multistationary (respectively, nondegenerately multistationary or
multistable) if and only if cappos(G) > 1 (repectively, capnondeg(G) > 1 or capexp-stab(G) > 1 ).
Stable steady states are nondegenerate, so the following inequalities hold for all networks G:

cappos(G) ≥ capnondeg(G) ≥ capexp-stab(G) .

It is natural to ask under what hypotheses do these inequalities become equality:

Conjecture 2.3 (Nondegeneracy conjecture). If cappos(G) < ∞, then cappos(G) = capnondeg(G).

The results in this work are consistent with Conjecture 2.3, but we can not prove it in
general. The following example demonstrates why the cappos(G) < ∞ assumption is necessary.

Example 2.4 (Inﬁnitely many degenerate steady states). Let G denote the simple network
0 ← A → 2A.
If the two rate constants are equal, then every positive value xA > 0 is a
degenerate steady state (so, cappos(G) = ∞), whereas when the two rate constants are not
equal, then the resulting system admits no positive steady states (so, capnondeg(G) = 0).

For a more interesting example, consider the following network:

G′ = {A + B → 0 ,

2A → 3A + B} .

The mass-action ODEs are:

dxA
dt

=

dxB
dt

= − kxAxB + lx2

A ,

so the compatibility classes are P = {(a, a + T ) ∈ R2
≥0}, where T ∈ R. Thus, the positive steady
states come from the positive roots of 0 = −k(xA + T ) + lxA = (−k + l)xA − kT . So, if k 6= l,
there is at most 1 positive steady state (arising from x∗
A = kT /(l − k), if l > k). On the other
hand, if k = l, then no positive steady states exist if T 6= 0, whereas the entire compatibility class
consists of steady states if T = 0. Thus, G′ admits inﬁnitely many degenerate positive steady
states (so, cappos(G′) = ∞), but at most 1 nondegenerate one (so, capnondeg(G′) = 1). We will
recover this result later (part 3b of Theorem 4.8); see Example 4.10.

Now we can state a shorter version of Question 1.1: which reaction networks are multistation-
ary? As mentioned in the introduction, this question is diﬃcult in general: assessing whether
a given network is multistationary means determining if the parametrized family of polynomial
systems arising from the mass-action ODEs (1) ever admits two or more positive solutions.

We also pose the following related questions, because in applications we are most interested

in the steady states that we can observe:

Question 2.5. Which reaction networks are nondegenerately multistationary?

Question 2.6. Which reaction networks are multistable?

Other authors have posed such questions (e.g., [2, 12]). Nevertheless, here we give the ﬁrst
complete answer for the smallest networks: those with one reaction or one species (Section 3),
two reactions and two species (Section 4), and two (possibly reversible) reactions (Section 5).

Now we recall a well-known fact2: the networks that admit positive steady states are the
consistent ones. A network is consistent if its reaction vectors are positively linearly dependent.

Lemma 2.7. Let G be a network. Then cappos(G) ≥ 1 if and only if G is consistent.

Lemma 2.7 implies that if a two-reaction network admits positive steady states, then its
reaction vectors are negative scalar multiples of each other (we will state this in Lemma 4.1).
For instance, {A + D → B + D, 2A + D → C + D} from [2, Example 10] is not multistationary.
One important subclass of consistent networks is formed by the weakly reversible networks.
In fact, Deng et al. showed that weakly reversible networks admit positive steady states (in
every stoichiometric compatibility class, for all choices of rate constants) [9].

2For instance, see [15, Remark 2.1] or [2, Lemma D.2].

2.3 The deﬁciency of a chemical reaction network

The deﬁciency δ of a reaction network is an important invariant. To deﬁne it, recall that p
denotes the number of complexes of a network, and let l denote the number of linkage classes
(connected components). For most networks in this work, each linkage class contains a unique
terminal strong linkage class, i.e. a maximal strongly connected subgraph in which there are
no reactions from a complex in the subgraph to a complex outside the subgraph. In this case,
Feinberg showed that the deﬁciency of the network can be computed in the following way:

δ := p − l − dim(S) ,

(5)

where S denotes the stoichiometric subspace (3). The deﬁciency of a reaction network is non-
negative because it can be interpreted as the dimension of a certain linear subspace [11].

The foremost results in deﬁciency theory are the following, which are due to Feinberg [13]:

Lemma 2.8 (Deﬁciency zero theorem). Deﬁciency-zero networks are not multistationary:

1. Every zero-deﬁciency network that is weakly reversible admits a unique positive steady
state in every stoichiometric compatibility class (for any choice of rate constants), and
this steady state is locally asymptotically stable.

2. Every zero-deﬁciency network that is not weakly reversible admits no positive steady states

(for any choice of rate constants).

Lemma 2.9 (Deﬁciency one theorem). Consider a network G with linkage classes G1, G2, . . . ,
Gl. Let δ denote the deﬁciency of G, and let δi denote the deﬁciency of Gi. Assume that:

1. each Gi has only one terminal strong linkage class (this holds if Gi is weakly reversible),
2. δi ≤ 1 for all i = 1, 2, . . . , l, and
3. δ1 + δ2 + · · · + δl = δ.

Then G is not multistationary: every resulting mass-action system admits either 0 positive
steady states or exactly 1 in every stoichiometric compatibility class.

2.4 Minimal multistationary networks

We now recall the deﬁnition of “embedding” and how this notion is useful for assessing multista-
tionarity. Embedded networks were introduced by the authors in [28]. The embedding relation
generalizes the subnetwork relation – a subnetwork N is obtained from a reaction network G
by removing a subset of reactions (that is, setting some of the reaction rates to 0), while an
embedded network is obtained by removing a subset of reactions and/or species. For instance,
removing the species B from the reaction A + B → A + C results in the reaction A → A + C.

Deﬁnition 2.10. Given a set of reactions R and a set of species S, the restriction of R to S,
denoted R|S, is the subset of R remaining after performing the following steps: (1) set to 0
the stoichiometric coeﬃcients of all species not in S, and then (2) discard any trivial reactions

(reactions of the formP miAi →P pjAj, i.e., when the source complex equals the product).

Deﬁnition 2.11. The embedded network N of a network G = (S, C, R) obtained by removing
the set of reactions {y → y′} ⊆ R and the set of species {Xi} ⊆ S is

N =(cid:16)S|C|RN

, C|RN , RN := (R \ {y → y′}) |S\{Xi}(cid:17) .

If N is embedded in G, then under some hypotheses, capnondeg(N ) ≤ capnondeg(G) (see the
survey [30, §4]). One such result, due to Joshi and Shiu [29, Theorem 3.1],“lifts” steady states
from a subnetwork to a larger network if they share the same stoichiometric subspace:

Lemma 2.12. Let N be a subnetwork of a reaction network G which has the same stoichiometric
subspace as G. Then capnondeg(N ) ≤ capnondeg(G) and capexp-stab(N ) ≤ capexp-stab(G).

7

This motivates the search for the minimal multistationary networks:

Deﬁnition 2.13.

1. A network is an embedding-minimal multistationary network if, with
respect to the embedded network relation, it is minimal among all networks that admit
multiple nondegenerate positive steady states.

2. An embedding-minimal multistable network is minimal with respect to the embedded net-

work relation among all networks that admit multiple stable positive steady states.

The embedding-minimal multistationary networks previously discovered are (1) certain net-
works with 1 or 2 species and all inﬂow/outﬂow reactions [30, Theorem 6.1], and (2) some
“sequestration” networks [30, Theorem 6.11]3. One of our contributions here is to add to this
list of known embedding-minimal multistationary networks (Theorem 1.3).

3 Networks with only one reaction or only one species

Theorem 3.7 in this section answers Questions 1.1 and 2.5–2.6 for two easy cases: when there is
only one reaction or one species. As a preview to the theorem, we now give some examples.

Example 3.1. For the network consisting of the single reaction A + B → 2A, the mass-action
ODEs (2) are

dxA
dt

= − κxAxB = −

dxB
dt

.

So, xA = 0 or xB = 0 at steady state, and therefore there are no positive steady states. Clearly,
such an argument generalizes for any 1-reaction network: see Theorem 3.7 (part 1) below.

To motivate the second case – networks with only one species – we recall the following result,
which is part of Joshi’s classiﬁcation of fully open networks (i.e., with all inﬂows/outﬂows) and
one non-ﬂow reaction [27]:

Proposition 3.2. The (general) fully open network with one species and one non-ﬂow reaction:

is multistationary if and only if 1 < m1 < n1.

0 ↔ A

m1A → n1A

In light of Proposition 3.2, what distinguishes the multistationary network 0 ↔ A, 2A →
3A from the non-multistationary network 0 ↔ A, 2A ← 3A? Also, can this distinction be
generalized beyond the case of fully open networks? The answers are as follows. First, the
reactions in the ﬁrst network have the form “→←→” (as seen in 0 → A, 0 ← A, 2A → 3A, where
we list the reactions so that the reactants are in increasing order) vs. “→←←” in the second
network. And, indeed, these ideas generalize (see Deﬁnition 3.4 and part 2 of Theorem 3.7).

A ﬁnal example is the 1-species network 0 ← A → 2A from Example 2.4 that admits inﬁnitely
many (degenerate) positive steady states. We will see that this property (admitting inﬁnitely
many degenerate positive steady states) has a simple characterization in the 1-species case: all
reactants (in the example, the complex A) must have both “depleting” reactions (here, 0 ← A)
and “producing” reactions (A → 2A); see Deﬁnition 3.6 and part 2 of Theorem 3.7.

3.1 Main result

To state the main result of this section (Theorem 3.7), we need the following deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 3.3. The sign of a real number a ∈ R is

sign(a) :=

+ if a > 0
0
if a = 0
− if a < 0 .

3The authors conjectured in [30, §6.3] that these sequestration networks are embedding-minimal multistationary

networks, and subsequently Felix, Shiu, and Woodstock resolved this for the smallest cases [17].

8

We deﬁne the sign of a vector x ∈ Rn component-wise: sign(x) := (sign(x1), sign(x2), . . . sign(xn)) ∈
{+, 0, −}n. The number of sign changes in such a vector of signs v ∈ {+, 0, −}n is obtained by
ﬁrst removing all 0’s from v and then counting the number of times in the resulting vector a
coordinate switches from + to − or from − to +. For instance, the vector (+, −, −, 0, −, 0, +)
has two sign changes.

Deﬁnition 3.4. For positive integers T ≥ 2, a T -alternating network is a 1-species network
that consists of T + 1 reactions miA → niA (for i = 1, 2, . . . , T + 1) such that the stoichiometric
coeﬃcients mi, ni ∈ Z≥0 satisfy:

1. m1 < m2 < · · · < mT +1, and
2. the vector of signs

(sign(n1 − m1), sign(n2 − m2),

. . . , sign(nT +1 − mT +1)) ∈ {+, −}T

is alternating: either (−, +, −, · · · ) (which we call the “←→← · · · ” case) or (+, −, +, · · · )
(the “→←→ · · · ” case).

Example 3.5. Consider the following network:

G = {0 ← A → 2A ⇆ 3A → A} .

1. {0 ← A, 2A → 3A} is a 1-alternating subnetwork of G of the form “←→”.

2. Each of the following is a 1-alternating subnetwork of G of the form “→←”: {A →

2A, 2A ← 3A}, {A → 2A, A ← 3A}, and {A → 3A, 2A ← 3A}.

3. {0 ← A, A → 2A} is not a 1-alternating subnetwork of G (the two reactants are equal).

4. {0 ← A, 2A → 3A, 2A ← 3A} is a 2-alternating subnetwork of G of the form “←→←”.

Deﬁnition 3.6. A reactant complex y of a 1-species network has a depleting reaction (a “←”
reaction) if there exists a reaction y′ ← y in the network with y′ < y. Similarly, y has a
producing reaction (a “→” reaction) if there exists a reaction y → y′ in the network with y < y′.

Theorem 3.7 (Classiﬁcation of multistationary networks with only one reaction or species).

1. Every network that consists of a single (irreversible) reaction (y → y′) or a single pair of

reversible reactions (y ⇆ y′) is not multistationary.

2. Let G be a network with only one species. Then G is multistationary (i.e., cappos(G) ≥ 2)
if and only if G has a 2-alternating subnetwork or every reactant complex of G has both a
depleting reaction and a producing reaction. Moreover:

(a) G admits inﬁnitely many (degenerate) positive steady states (i.e., cappos(G) = ∞) if
and only if every reactant complex has both a depleting reaction and a producing one.

(b) For T ≥ 2, G admits at least T nondegenerate positive steady states (i.e., capnondeg(G) ≥

T ) if and only if G has a T -alternating subnetwork.

(c) For T ≥ 2, G admits at least ⌈T /2⌉ (respectively, ⌊T /2⌋) exponentially stable positive
steady states (i.e., capexp-stab(G) ≥ ⌈T /2⌉ or ≥ ⌊T /2⌋, respectively) if G has a T -
alternating subnetwork of the form “ →←→ · · · ” (respectively, “ ←→← · · · ”).

Thus, G is nondegenerately multistationary if and only if G has a 2-alternating subnetwork.

We will prove Theorem 3.7 in Section 3.2.

Remark 3.8. In [4], Boros analyzed 1-species networks that consist of two reversible reactions

y ⇆ y′ and ey ⇆ ey′ with no complexes in common, and determined that such a network is
multistationary if and only if the network has the form “⇆ ⇆” (for instance, if y < y′ <ey <ey′).

Here, Theorem 3.7 easily recovers Boros’s criterion. See also Theorem 5.12.

Corollary 3.9. Every nondegenerately multistationary reaction network satisﬁes r + s ≥ 4,
where r is the number of reactions and s is the number of species.

9

Proof. We prove the contrapositive. The options for (r, s) are (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 1). If r = 1,
then the result follows from Theorem 3.7 (part 1). In the remaining case, the network has only
one species and two reactions, so it does not have a 2-alternating subnetwork, and hence the
result follows from Theorem 3.7 (part 2).

The only obstacle to a partial converse of Corollary 3.9 is the fact that 1-reaction networks
are not multistationary. That is, we have the following result, which we will prove in Section 4.1:

Proposition 3.10. If r + s ≥ 4, with r ≥ 2, then there exists a nondegenerately multistationary
reaction network with exactly r reactions and s species.

Returning to 1-species/1-reaction, Theorem 3.7 directly implies the next two results:

Corollary 3.11. For a reaction network G that has only one species, the capacity of G (i.e.,
the maximum number of nondegenerate positive steady states) is

capnondeg(G) = max{T ∈ Z≥0 | G has a T −alternating subnetwork} ,

and the maximum number of positive steady states is:

cappos(G) = 

∞

if every reactant complex has both a depleting

reaction and a producing reaction

capnondeg(G)

else.

We obtain new inﬁnite families of 1-species minimal multistationary/multistable networks4:

Corollary 3.12 (Classiﬁcation of embedding-minimal multistationary/multistable networks
with one reaction or one species).

1. There are no 1-reaction embedding-minimal multistationary or multistable networks.

2. The 1-species embedding-minimal multistationary networks are precisely the 2-alternating

networks (in other words, the “←→←” networks and the “→←→” networks).

3. The 1-species embedding-minimal multistable networks are precisely the 3-alternating net-

works of the form “←→←→”.

Now we consider at-most-bimolecular networks. A complex is at-most-bimolecular if it is of
the form 0, A, 2A, or A + B. In other words, the sum of the stoichiometric coeﬃcients over all
the species in the complex is at most 2. A reaction network is itself at-most-bimolecular if all
its complexes are at-most-bimolecular.

Corollary 3.13. Suppose that G is an at-most-bimolecular reaction network. If G has only one
reaction or only one species, then G is not nondegenerately multistationary (i.e., capnondeg(G) ≤
1), and thus is not multistable.

Proof. By Theorem 3.7 (part 1), if G has only one reaction, it is not multistationary. If G has
only one species, then it is nondegenerately multistationary if and only if G has a 2-alternating
subnetwork by Theorem 3.7 (part 2). Assuming that G is nondegenerately multistationary,
G must have a 2-alternating subnetwork {m1A → n1A, m2A → n2A, m3A → n3A} with
0 ≤ m1 < m2 < m3 ≤ 2. The only possible choice is (m1, m2, m3) = (0, 1, 2). It follows that
n1 > m1 and the only possible vector of signs is (sign(n1 − m1), sign(n2 − m2), sign(n3 − m3)) =
(+, −, +). This implies that n3 > m3 = 2, a contradiction. So, either G is not at-most-
bimolecular, or G is not nondegenerately multistationary.

4Part 2 of Corollary 3.12 includes a family of networks aready known to be embedding-minimal multistationary

networks [30, Theorem 6.1 (part 2)].

10

3.2 Proof of Theorem 3.7

The proof of Theorem 3.7 requires two preliminary results.

Lemma 3.14. Let G be a 1-species network, and let T be a positive integer with T ≥ 2.

1. If there exists a choice of positive rate constants so that for the resulting mass-action ODE

˙xA = c0 + c1xA + · · · + cm(xA)m ,

(6)

the vector of coeﬃcients (sign(c0), sign(c1), . . . , sign(cm)) has at least T sign changes, then
G contains a T-alternating subnetwork.

2. If there exists a choice of positive rate constants so that the resulting mass-action ODE (6)
is the zero polynomial (ci = 0 for all i), then every reactant complex of G has both a
depleting reaction and a producing reaction.

Proof. Letting r denote the number of reactions of G, we write the reactions as pjA → qjA, for
j = 1, 2, . . . , r. Therefore, the coeﬃcient cm in the mass-action ODE polynomial (6) is:

cm = X{j∈R|pj =m}

κj(qj − m) .

(7)

Let κ1, κ2, . . . , κr > 0 be rate constants that satisfy the hypothesis of part 1 of the lemma.
Thus, there exist T + 1 indices 0 ≤ m1 < m2 < · · · < mT +1 such that the vector of coeﬃcients

(cid:0)sign(cm1), sign(cm2 ), . . . , sign(cmT +1)(cid:1) of the resulting mass-action ODE (6) is alternating: ei-

ther (+, −, +, · · · ) or (−, +, −, · · · ). Examining the coeﬃcient cmi as in (7), it follows that there
exists a reaction miA → qjA with sign(cmi) = sign(qj − mi). Thus, those T + 1 reactions (from
i = 1, 2, . . . , T + 1) form a T -alternating subnetwork of G.

Now let κ1, κ2, . . . , κr > 0 be rate constants that satisfy the hypothesis of part 2 of the
lemma; thus, ci = 0 for all i. Consider any reactant complex pkA. Then, the corresponding
sum (7) for cpk must have at least one positive and at least one negative summand, which
correspond to a producing reaction and a depleting reaction, respectively. Thus, every reactant
complex has both a producing and a depleting reaction.

Both converses of Lemma 3.14 hold; these are essentially contained in the proof of Theorem 3.7.
Lemma 3.16 below, due to Grabiner [19], states that for polynomials whose coeﬃcients
alternate in sign, the bound from Descartes’ rule can be achieved by some choice of coeﬃcients.

Proposition 3.15 (Descartes’ rule of signs – bound only). Given a nonzero univariate real
polynomial f (x) = c0 + c1x + · · · + crxr, the number of positive real roots of f , counted with
multiplicity, is bounded above by the number of sign variations in the ordered sequence of the
coeﬃcients sign(c0), . . . , sign(cr), i.e., discard the 0’s in this sequence and then count the number
of times two consecutive signs diﬀer.

Lemma 3.16 (Bound in Descartes’ rule of signs achieved [19]). For 0 < l1 < l2 < . . . < lq,
consider the polynomial

P (x) := 1 − k1xl1 + k2xl2 − · · · + (−1)qkqxlq .

Then there exist k1 > 0, k2 > 0, . . . , kq > 0 such that P (x) has q positive roots 0 < x∗
· · · < x∗

i ) < 0 for i odd and P ′(x∗

i ) > 0 for i even.

1 < x∗

2 <

q, and P ′(x∗

Proof. This follows immediately from [19, Theorem 1] and its proof.

We now prove our classiﬁcation theorem for networks with one species or one reaction.

11

Proof of Theorem 3.7. Part 1 of the theorem follows from Lemma 2.8 (the deﬁciency zero the-
orem): such a network has deﬁciency zero.

To prove ⇒ of part 2, assume that G is multistationary. Thus, there exist rate constants
κ1, κ2, . . . , κr > 0 so that the resulting mass-action ODE dxA
dt =: f (xA), as in equation (6),
If f is the zero polynomial, then by part 2 of
is a polynomial with multiple positive roots.
Lemma 3.14, every reactant complex of G has both a depleting reaction and a producing reaction.
If f is not the zero polynomial, then ⇒ of part 2 follows from Lemma 3.14 (part 1) and Descartes’
rule of signs (Proposition 3.15). Similarly, those two results prove ⇒ of part 2(b).

For 2(a), the only polynomial with inﬁnitely many positive roots is the zero polynomial, so
if G admits inﬁnitely many positive steady states, they are degenerate and the corresponding
mass-action ODE is the zero polynomial. Thus, ⇒ of 2(a) follows from part 2 of Lemma 3.14.
For ⇐ of 2(a), if every reactant complex has both a depleting reaction and a producing reaction,
then each coeﬃcient in the mass-action ODE is a sum of negative and positive summands (as
in equation (7)). Therefore, the reaction rate constants κj > 0 can be chosen so that each
coeﬃcient is zero, and therefore G admits inﬁnitely many degenerate positive steady states.

For 2(c) and ⇐ of 2(b), we ﬁrst show that every T -alternating network admits T nondegen-
erate positive steady states, of which ⌈T /2⌉ are exponentially stable in the “→←→ · · · ” case,
or ⌊T /2⌋ are in the “←→← · · · ” case. For such a network, the mass-action ODE (2) is:

dxA
dt

= κ1(n1 − m1)(xA)m1 + κ2(n2 − m2)(xA)m2 + · · · + κT +1(nT +1 − mT +1)(xA)mT +1 ,

where m1 < m2 < · · · < mT +1 and the vector of signs of the coeﬃcients is either (+, −, +, · · · )
(the “→←→ · · · ” case) or (−, +, −, · · · ) (in the other case). For the (+, −, +, · · · ) case, via the
coordinate change ˜κi := κi |ni − mi|, we need only ﬁnd ˜κi > 0 such that

f (x) := ˜κ1xm1 − ˜κ2xm2 + · · · + (−1)T ˜κT +1xmT +1 = 0

(8)

has T positive roots x ∈ R>0, of which ⌈T /2⌉ satisfy f ′(x) < 0.
Indeed, this follows from
Lemma 3.16. Finally, the proof for the (−, +, −, · · · ) case proceeds similarly (T positive roots,
and at ⌊T /2⌋ of them, the derivative is negative). Now, part 2(c) and ⇐ of part 2(b) follow
immediately from Lemma 2.12. Finally, ⇒ of part 2 now follows from parts 2(b–c).

4 Networks with two reactions and two species

The previous section answered the questions of multistationarity and multistability when there
is only one reaction or one species; here, Theorem 4.5 answers these questions when there
are two reactions and two species. Furthermore, Theorem 4.8 characterizes the number and
stability of these steady states. Moreover, this criterion for multistationarity is geometric, via
‘box diagrams’, and will in turn generalize to the case of more species (Theorem 5.2).

Before stating results, we recall that only consistent networks admit positive steady states:

If G admits at least one positive steady state, then the reaction vectors are (strictly) negative

Lemma 4.1. Let G be a network with exactly two reactions, denoted by y → y′ and ey → ey′.
scalar multiples of each other: y′ − y = −λ(ey′ −ey) for some λ > 0.
λ2(ey′ −ey) = (0, 0) for some λ1, λ2 > 0, and, hence, λ = λ2/λ1 veriﬁes the result.

Proof. G admits a positive steady state, so G is consistent (Lemma 2.7). Thus, λ1(y′ − y) +

4.1 Main results

To state Theorem 4.5, we must deﬁne reactant polytopes (Newton polytopes) and box diagrams.

Deﬁnition 4.2 ([18]). The reactant polytope of a network G is the convex hull of (i.e., the
smallest convex set containing) the reactants of G (in Rs, where s is the number of species).

12

Deﬁnition 4.3. Let G be a network with exactly two species and two reactions, y → y′ and
˜y → ˜y′, such that the reactant vectors diﬀer in both coordinates (i.e., writing y = (yA, yB) and
˜y = (˜yA, ˜yB), then both yA 6= ˜yA and yB 6= ˜yB). The box diagram of the network G is the
rectangle in R2 for which

1. the edges are parallel to the axes of R2, and
2. the reactants y and y′ are two opposite corners of the rectangle.

Remark 4.4. The box diagram is the smallest rectangle containing the reactant polytope.

It will be useful to depict a box diagram together with the reaction vectors and the reactant
polytope (which in this case is the diagonal of the box that connects the two reactants). For
example, consider the network {B → A, A + 2B → 3B}, which is a subnetwork of a bistable
network for modeling apoptosis due to Ho and Harrington [23]. Its box diagram is:

3B

A + 2B

B

A

The aim of Theorem 4.5 below is to give an easy-to-check criterion for multistationarity via
box diagrams. For instance, the diagram depicted above has the form of one of the four in (9),
so we quickly conclude that the network is multistationary (but not, it turns out, bistable).
Conversely, for a network with exactly two reactions and two species, if its box diagram does
not have one of the forms depicted in (9), then it is not nondegenerately multistationary. For
instance, the autocatalytic network {A → B → 2A} from [2, Example 13] is not multistationary.

Theorem 4.5 (Classiﬁcation of nondegenerately multistationary networks with two reactions
and two species). Let G be a network with exactly two species and two reactions, denoted by

y → y′ andey →ey′. Then G is nondegenerately multistationary if and only if the following hold:
1. the reaction vectors are negative scalar multiples of each other, i.e., y′ − y = −λ(ey′ −ey)

2. the two reactants diﬀer in both coordinates (so the box diagram of G is deﬁned),

for some λ > 0,

3. the slope of the reactant polytope is not -1, and

4. the box diagram of G has one of the following zigzag forms:

Theorem 4.5 will largely follow from Theorem 4.8 below, which goes beyond multistationarity
to the precise number and nature of the steady states. We postpone the proof until Section 4.2.

To state Theorem 4.8, we introduce the following notation:

(9)

Deﬁnition 4.6. For a species i and two reactions y → y′ and ey →ey′, we deﬁne

Letting s denote the number of species, we write

βi(y → y′, ey →ey′) := (y′

i − yi)(eyi − yi) ∈ Z.

β(y → y′, ey →ey′) := (β1(y → y′, ey →ey′), . . . , βs(y → y′, ey →ey′))

= (y′ − y) ∗ (ey − y) ∈ Zs ,

where ∗ denotes the Hadamard product, deﬁned by (u1, . . . , us)∗(v1, . . . , vs) := (u1v1, . . . , usvs).

13

Lemma 4.7 below states that for a two-reaction network, if the two reactions are positively
dependent, then the sign of βi does not depend on the order of the two reactions, and therefore
may be viewed as a function of the network itself. We will see in Theorems 4.8 and 5.1 that the
signs of the βi’s classify multistationary networks with two reactions and two species.

sign(βi(y → y′, ey →ey′)) = sign(βi(ey →ey′, y → y′)) .
i − yi)(yi −eyi)) = sign((y′

Lemma 4.7. If y′ − y = −λ(ey′ −ey) for some λ > 0, then
Proof. If y′ − y = −λ(ey′ −ey), where λ > 0, then sign(βi(ey →ey′, y → y′)) = sign((ey′
i −eyi)(yi −
eyi)) = sign ((−1/λ)(y′
Let G be a network with exactly two species and two reactions, denoted by y → y′ and ey →ey′.
For the two species i = 1, 2, let βi := βi(y → y′, ey →ey′). Then, G is not multistable. Moreover,
if the reaction vectors are negative scalar multiples of each other: y′ − y = −λ(ey′ −ey) for some

i − yi)(eyi − yi)) = sign(βi(y → y′, ey →ey′)).

Theorem 4.8 (Classiﬁcation of multistationary networks with two reactions and two species).

1. Suppose that (β1, β2) = (0, 0). Then G admits the following possibilities and nothing else:

λ > 0, then we have the following cases:

(i) inﬁnitely many degenerate positive steady states, (ii) no positive steady states.

2. Suppose that β1 = 0 or β2 = 0, but not both. We have the following subcases:

(a) If y′

1 = y1 and β2 6= 0 (or, symmetrically, if y′

2 = y2 and β1 6= 0), then G admits
exactly one nondegenerate positive steady state (in every stoichiometric compatibility
class, for all choices of rate constants).

(b) In the remaining case — when y′

y′
else: (i) no positive steady states, (ii) exactly one nondegenerate positive steady state.

1 6= y1, ey1 = y1, and β2 6= 0 (or, symmetrically, if
2 6= y2,ey2 = y2, and β1 6= 0) — then G admits the following possibilities and nothing

3. Suppose that β1 6= 0 and β2 6= 0. We have the following subcases:
(a) If β1β2 > 0, then G admits exactly one positive steady state.

possibilities and nothing else: (i) inﬁnitely many degenerate steady states, (ii) exactly
one nondegenerate positive steady state, (iii) no positive steady states.

(b) If β1β2 < 0 and ey − y is a scalar multiple of (1, −1), then G admits the following
(c) If β1β2 < 0 and ey − y is not a scalar multiple of (1, −1), then G admits all the

following possibilities and nothing else: (i) exactly two positive nondegenerate steady
states, exactly one of which is exponentially stable, (ii) one doubly degenerate positive
steady state, (iii) no positive steady states.

Hence, G is nondegenerately multistationary (in fact, capnondeg(G) = 2) if and only if y′ − y =

Remark 4.9. We will see that the condition “the slope of the reactant polytope is not −1” (in

−λ(ey′ −ey) for some λ > 0, β1β2 < 0, and ey − y is not a scalar multiple of (1, −1).
Theorem 4.5) is equivalent to “ey − y is not a scalar multiple of (1, −1)” (in Theorem 4.8). We

employ both, because the former theorem highlights geometric conditions on the box diagram,
while the latter presents the corresponding algebraic conditions on the reactions. Similarly, we
will see that the box-diagram condition (9) is equivalent to the inequality β1β2 < 0.
Example 4.10 (A reactant polytope with slope −1). We revisit the network G′ = {A +
B → 0, 2A → 3A + B} from Example 2.4. Here, (β1, β2) := (1, 1) ∗ (1, −1) = (1, −1) and

ey − y = (1, −1), so by Theorem 4.8 (part 3b), G′ admits inﬁnitely many degenerate positive

steady states (so, cappos(G′) = ∞), but at most 1 nondegenerate one (so, capnondeg(G′) = 1).
We found the same result earlier. Alternatively, the reactant polytope is the convex hull of (1, 1)
and (2, 0), so its slope is −1, and thus, G′ is not nondegenerately multistationary (Theorem 4.5).

As in Corollary 3.12 earlier, we ﬁnd an inﬁnite family of minimal multistationary networks:

Corollary 4.11 (Classiﬁcation of embedding-minimal multistationary/multistable networks
with two reactions and two species).

14

1. A reaction network G with exactly two species and two reactions is an embedding-minimal
multistationary network if and only if G is nondegenerately multistationary.
In other
words, the 2-reaction, 2-species embedding-minimal multistationary networks are precisely
those networks described in Theorem 4.5.

2. There are no 2-reaction, 2-species embedding-minimal multistable networks.

Proof. Part 2 is immediate from Theorem 4.8. For part 1, the ⇐ direction is by deﬁnition.
For the ⇒ direction, we need only show that for a 2-species, 2-reaction network, removing one
species and/or one reaction yields a network without multiple nondegenerate positive steady
states (removing more than one species or reaction would yield a trivial network). First, a
1-reaction network is not multistationary (Theorem 3.7), so we need only consider removing
exactly one species. A resulting such network has one species and at most two reactions, so it
is not nondegenerately multistationary (Theorem 4.5).

The next result, which is analogous to Corollary 3.13 earlier and will be superseded later by
Corollary 5.5, follows from the fact that the box diagrams (9) in Theorem 4.5 do not ﬁt in the
triangle {(a, b) | 0 ≤ a, 0 ≤ b, a + b ≤ 2}.

Corollary 4.12. Suppose that G is an at-most-bimolecular reaction network. If G has exactly
two reactions and two species, then G is not nondegenerately multistationary, i.e., capnondeg(G) ≤
1, and thus is not multistable.

Finally, we prove Proposition 3.10 from earlier, which states that there exist nondegenerately
multistationary reaction networks with r reactions and s species whenever r + s ≥ 4, with r ≥ 2.

Proof of Proposition 3.10. If s = 1, then r ≥ 3, so an (r − 1)-alternating network is a 1-
species, r-reaction network that is nondegenerately multistationary (Theorem 3.7). So, now
assume s ≥ 2. We construct an s-species, r-reaction network as follows. Begin with a 2-
species, 2-reaction network for which the box diagram is one of the four depicted in (9). This
network is nondegenerately multistationary by Theorem 4.5. Next, add (r − 2) extra reactions
that each a scalar multiple of the original two reaction vectors, thereby preserving the (1-
dimensional) stoichiometric subspace. The resulting network is nondegenerately multistationary
by Lemma 2.12. Finally, add in the remaining (s−2) species trivially; for instance, add a species
to both sides of a reaction (e.g., replace A → B by A + C → B + C).

4.2 Proofs of Theorems 4.5 and 4.8

We begin with a lemma that interprets the βi’s in terms of the box diagram.
Lemma 4.13. Let G be a network with exactly two species and two reactions, denoted by y → y′

and ey →ey′. For each species i = 1, 2, let βi := βi(y → y′, ey →ey′). Let γ denote the slope of

the reaction vector y → y′, and let α be the slope of the reactant polytope of the network. Then,
β2/β1 = γα, whenever β1 and β2 are nonzero.

Proof. This is immediate from the fact that γ = y′

1−y1

and α = ey2−y2

Proof of Theorem 4.8. Recall that the reaction vectors must be negative scalar multiples of each
other for the network to be multistationary (Lemma 4.1). Now we use this relationship between
the reaction vectors to simplify the diﬀerential equations:

note that it is impossible for y′
2 − y2 = 0, i.e., at least one of diﬀerential equations (10–
11) must be nonzero, because otherwise the reaction y → y′ would be trivial. Therefore, the
steady state equations dxi

1 − y1 = y′

We begin with the case when (β1, β2) = ((y′

the steady state equation (13) is a vertical line, namely, x1 =(cid:16) k

compatibility class (12) also is a vertical line, so for one choice of T , these two lines coincide
(resulting in a stoichiometric compatibility class consisting entirely of degenerate steady states);

Via K :=(cid:16)λek/k(cid:17)1/(y2−ey2)

, we rewrite the stoichiometric and steady state equations (12–13):

γ := (y′

1 − y1)

x2 = g(x1) := γx1 + T /(y′
x2 = h(x1) := Kx−1/α

,

so the positive steady states correspond to positive solutions x1 ∈ R to the equation h(x1) −
g(x1) = 0. Accordingly, the remainder of the proof comprises counting these solutions; more
precisely, for ﬁxed values of γ and α, we will determine the possible numbers of solutions as

K > 0 and T ∈ R vary (note that K can take any positive value, by choice of k andek).

We begin with the subcase β1β2 > 0, i.e., γα > 0. If α > 0 and γ > 0, then h(x1) − g(x1) is
a decreasing function for x1 > 0 (because h and −g are decreasing) that is positive for positive
x1 ≈ 0 and negative for x1 ≫ 0; hence, there is a unique positive steady state. Similarly, if
α < 0 and γ < 0, then h(x1) − g(x1) is increasing (because h and −g are increasing) and is
negative for positive x1 ≈ 0 and positive for x1 ≫ 0; hence, there is a unique positive steady
state, and it is nondegenerate.

Now consider the subcase when the slope of the reactant polytope is α = −1 (i.e., ey − y
is a scalar multiple of (1, −1), as the reactant polytope is the line segment from y to ey) and

16

the slope of the reaction vectors is γ > 0. Both g and h are lines with positive slopes, namely
γ and K, which pass through the positive orthant. Therefore, there can be either inﬁnitely
many (degenerate) positive steady states (for instance, when T = 0 and K = γ), a unique
(nondegenerate) positive steady state (e.g., if T > 0 and K > γ), or no positive steady states
(e.g., if T > 0 and K < γ).

The remaining subcase is when the slope α of the reactant polytope is not −1 and its sign
is opposite that of the (shared, nonzero) slope of the reaction vectors. We have two further
subcases, based on the signs of γ and α. First, if γ < 0 (so, α > 0), then g is linear and
decreasing, and h is concave down and decreasing, so there are at most 2 intersection points of
their graphs (i.e., up to 2 positive steady states). We will show that 0, 1, and 2 intersection
points are possible. For any choice of h (which is concave down and the derivative takes all
values in R<0), take the (unique) tangent line to the graph of h with slope γ: this line has the
form of g, and the resulting system has a doubly degenerate positive steady state. Now, shift
the line slightly to the left (now it does not intersect the graph of h), so that it still intersects
the positive orthant. It follows that the equation of the resulting line has the form of g, and
there are no positive steady states for this g and h. Similarly, shifting the line slightly to the
right yields 2 (nondegenerate) positive steady states – one exponentially stable, one unstable.

Finally, the γ > 0 (so, α < 0) case is similar to the γ < 0 case. Here, g is a line with
positive slope, and h is a positive (for x1 > 0) increasing function that is either concave up with
derivative taking all possible positive values (if −1 < α < 0) or concave down with derivative
taking all possible negative values (if α < −1). Thus, again there are at most 2 intersection
points. Now ﬁx h, and then pick T such that the graph of g is a tangent line of the graph of h:
this corresponds to a doubly degenerate point. Accordingly, adjusting T slightly so the graph
of g moves to the left yields either 2 nondegenerate positive steady states – one exponentially
stable, one unstable (if −1 < α < 0) or 0 positive steady states (if α < −1). Similarly, moving g
slightly to the right yields either 0 or 2 (nondegenerate) positive steady states, respectively.

Proof of Theorem 4.5. This result follows directly from Theorem 4.8, once we reinterpret the

scalar multiple of (1, −1)) in terms of box diagrams. To this end, the reactant polytope is the

polytope has slope not equal to −1. Also, by Lemma 4.13, β1β2 < 0 if and only if (a) the

conditions characterizing nondegenerate multistationarity (namely, β1β2 < 0 andey − y is not a
line segment from y to ey, so ey − y is not a scalar multiple of (1, −1) if and only if the reactant

and the slope of the reactant polytope are both deﬁned and nonzero, and have opposite signs;
equivalently, the box diagram of the network has one of the four forms depicted in (9).

5 Networks with two (possibly reversible) reactions

The previous section analyzed networks with exactly two reactions and two species. Now we
again consider networks with two reactions, but we allow any number of species and permit
each reaction to be possibly reversible. In this setting, Boros used Feinberg’s deﬁciency one
algorithm5 to resolve the question of multistationarity (Question 1.1) for those networks that
are “regular” (a technical condition that is stronger than being consistent, and is required
to apply the deﬁciency one algorithm) [4]. We describe those results in Theorems 5.1, 5.8,
and 5.12. Moreover, we go further: we determine which of these networks admit multiple
nondegenerate/stable steady states (to address Questions 2.5 and 2.6).

5.1 Networks with two reactions

Here we consider networks with exactly two reactions y → y′ and ey → ey′. This includes the

case of a single reversible reaction y ⇄ y′. As an aside, note that Boros analyzed the case of a
single reversible reaction together with all outﬂows [4]; here, we do not analyze such networks.

5The original presentation and proof of the deﬁciency one algorithm are in [14, 15]. A concise description is in [27].

5.1.1 Main results

We now state the two main results of this subsection, which generalize Theorems 4.5 and 4.8.
Theorem 5.1 in the 2-linkage-class case was done by Boros [4]6. We give an alternate proof,
which we postpone until Section 5.1.2.

Theorem 5.1 (Classiﬁcation of multistationary networks with two reactions). Let G be a net-

where s is the number of species. Then G is multistationary (i.e., cappos(G) ≥ 2) if and only if

work that consists of two reactions, denoted by y → y′ andey →ey′. Let β := (y′−y)∗(ey−y) ∈ Zs,
1. the reaction vectors are negative scalar multiples of each other: y′ − y = −λ(ey′ −ey) for

2. β either is the zero vector or has at least one positive and at least one negative coordinate.

some λ > 0, and

Theorem 5.2 (Classiﬁcation of nondegenerately multistationary networks with two reactions).

Let G be a network that consists of two reactions, denoted by y → y′ and ey → ey′. Let β :=
(y′ − y) ∗ (ey − y). Then G is nondegenerately multistationary if and only if
1. the reaction vectors are negative scalar multiples of each other: y′ − y = −λ(ey′ −ey) for

2. β has at least one positive and at least one negative coordinate, and

some λ > 0,

3. if β has exactly one positive and one negative coordinate, say βi > 0 and βj < 0, then the

projection of the reaction polytope to the (i, j) plane does not have slope −1.

Remark 5.3. Condition 2 of Theorem 5.2 is equivalent to requiring that for some choice of two
species i and j, the projection of the box diagram to the (i, j)-plane has one of the four (zigzag)
forms (9) from Theorem 4.5. To see this, recall Remark 4.9.

Remark 5.4. We wish to extend Theorem 5.2 to include a criterion for multistability. However,
at present, we do not know precisely which 2-reaction networks are multistable. In the 1- and
2-species cases, none are multistable (Theorems 3.7 and 4.8). In the 3-species case, some are
multistable: {A → B + C, 2A + B + C → 3A} is, but not {A + C → B, 2A + B → 3A + C}.

The following result is analogous to Corollary 3.13:

Corollary 5.5. Suppose that G is an at-most-bimolecular reaction network. If G has exactly
two reactions, then G is not nondegenerately multistationary, i.e., capnondeg(G) ≤ 1, and thus
is not multistable.

Proof. Let G be a 2-reaction, nondegenerately multistationary network. By Theorem 5.2, βi :=
(y′
i or
y′

i ≥ 3. Hence, G is not at-most-bimolecular.

Here we extend Corollary 4.11, which classiﬁed multistationary networks with 2 reactions

and 1 negative or 1 negative and 2 positive coordinates, and for the two pairs {i, j} for
which βiβj < 0, the projection of the reaction polytope to the (i, j) plane has slope −1.

6Boros did not use the function β, but it is easy to check that the conditions he gave are equivalent to those here.

18

Proof. The networks in (1) are embedding-minimal multistationary networks (Corollary 4.11).
The networks in (2), we now claim, are also embedding-minimal multistationary networks. First,
removing a reaction from such a network yields a 1-reaction network, which is not multistation-
ary (Theorem 3.7). Also, removing a species yields a 2-reaction, 2-species network such that
either β has coordinates of only one sign or β has one positive and one negative coordinate
but the reaction polytope has slope −1; such a network is not nondegenerately multistationary
(Theorem 4.8). Thus, the ⇒ implication of the corollary holds.

To prove ⇐, we must show that, besides those in (1) and (2), no other 2-reaction networks
are embedding-minimal multistationary networks. First, there are none with only 1 or 2 species
(Theorems 3.7 and 4.8). Next, consider a nondegenerately multstationary 2-reaction network
with exactly 3 species. If β contains a zero coordinate, then that species can be removed: doing
this does not aﬀect whether the conditions for multistationarity in Theorem 5.2 hold. Also,
for any pair {i, j} of species with βiβj < 0, then if the projection of the reaction polytope to
the (i, j) plane has slope not equal to −1, then the remaining third species can be removed,
yielding again a nondegenerately multistationary network (Theorem 4.8). Finally, for 2-reaction
networks with 4 or more species, we can remove either a species corresponding to a 0 coordinate
of β, or a species corrresponding to a coordinate of β whose sign appears more than once in β:
again, this does not aﬀect whether the conditions for multistationarity in Theorem 5.2 hold.

5.1.2 Proof of Theorems 5.1 and 5.2

Our proof of Theorems 5.1 and 5.2 uses Theorem 4.8 (which Theorem 5.2 generalizes).

Proof of Theorems 5.1 and 5.2. Condition 1 (which is the same in both theorems) must hold
for the network G to be multistationary (Lemma 4.1), so we will assume that it holds for the
rest of the proof. Thus, we can write the diﬀerential equation for species i = 1, 2, . . . , s as:

dxi
dt

= k(y′

i − yi)xy +ek(ey′

i −eyi)xey = (y′

i − yi) kxy −ek

λ

xey! .

(14)

For any species i for which y′
i = yi, that species concentration is ﬁxed for all time, and so we
may remove species i from further consideration. In other words, replacing G by the resulting
embedded network does not aﬀect whether it is multistationary or nondegenerately multista-
tionary, and also does not aﬀect the conditions listed in either theorem. So, for the rest of the
proof, we will assume that βj = (y′

j − yj)(eyj − yj) = 0 if and only if eyj = yj.

We begin with the case when β is the zero vector (βj = 0 for all j), or, equivalently, the two

= (y′

dxi
dt

reactants are equal: ey = y. Thus, from equation (14), the diﬀerential equations are:
Hence, if λk 6=ek, then there are no positive steady states (in any stoichiometric compatibility
class), and if λk =ek, then every stoichiometric compatibility class consists of (inﬁnitely many)

Having completed the case when all βi’s are zero, we will assume that at least one βi is
nonzero for the remainder of the proof. In fact, we will soon reduce to the case that every βi is
nonzero. To do so, we use the diﬀerential equations (14) to write the steady-state equation as
the following generalized-monomial equality:

degenerate steady states. Thus, cappos(G) = ∞ and capnondeg(G) = 0.

(17)

(18)

Thus, our goal is to determine whether (for some values of κ > 0 and ci ∈ R) the one-variable
equation (18) admits multiple (nondegenerate and degenerate) roots x1 ∈ R that lie in the (possi-
bly empty) interval D = D({ci}) := (d1, d2), where d1 := max ({0} ∪ {−ci/γi | 2 ≤ i ≤ s and γi > 0})
and d2 := min ({∞} ∪ {−ci/γi | 2 ≤ i ≤ s and γi < 0}).

Now we reduce to the case when each βi is nonzero. To do so, we may assume that species

remaining species j = s′ + 1, 2, . . . , s.) Thus, in this case, equation (18) reduces to:

i = 1, 2, . . . , s′ are precisely the ones that satisfy βi 6= 0. (So, βj = 0, i.e., eyj = yj, for the

(c2 + γ2x1)y2−ey2 · · · (cs′ + γs′ x1)ys′ −eys′ = κ .

(19)

xy1−ey1

Now let G′ denote the embedded network of G obtained by removing species s′ + 1, s′ + 2, . . . , s.
We claim now that G′ and G have the same capacities for multistationarity:

cappos(G) = cappos(G′) and

capnondeg(G) = capnondeg(G′) .

(20)

To prove (20), note that for G′, we are counting the maximum number of (nondegenerate and
degenerate) roots x1 ∈ R of the equation (19) that lie in the interval D′ := (d′
1 :=
max ({0} ∪ {−ci/γi | 2 ≤ i ≤ s′ and γi > 0}) and d′
(so, D′ contains D). Thus, the “≤” inequalities in (20) hold.

2 := min ({∞} ∪ {−ci/γi | 2 ≤ i ≤ s′ and γi < 0})

2), where d′

1, d′

For the “≥” inequalities, the steady-state equation (19) admits degenerate steady states if
and only if the equation itself is degenerate (if the left-hand side is itself a constant and equal
to κ) – indeed, in this case the ci’s can be picked so that the intervals D and D′ are nonempty –
so both G and G′ would admit inﬁnitely many degenerate steady states. In the nondegenerate
case, if equation (18) admits nondegenerate steady states x1(1), x1(2), . . . , x1(l) in the interval
D′ (for some choice of the c1, c2, . . . , cs′ and κ), then we may pick cs′+1, . . . , cs ∈ R so that all
the steady states x1(j) are in D, as follows. If γi > 0, let ci := 0; and if γi < 0, pick ci such
that −ci/γi > max{x1(1), x1(2), . . . , x1(l)}. This proves “≥” of (20), and thus for the rest of
the proof we may assume that βi 6= 0 for all species i.

Now we consider the cases with few species (assuming that βi 6= 0 for all i). First, the
s = 1 case is clear: 1-species networks with precisely two reactions are not multistationary
(Theorem 3.7), and β has only one coordinate (so no coordinates of opposite sign). In the s = 2
case, what we must show is that the 2-species, 2-reaction network G is multistationary if and
only if β1β2 < 0, and is nondegenerately multistationary if and only if β1β2 < 0 and the slope
of the reactant polytope is not -1. This is contained in Theorem 4.8; see also Remark 4.9.

So, for the remainder of the proof, assume that s ≥ 3 (and βi 6= 0 for all i). What we must
prove is that the following are equivalent: (i) G is multistationary, (ii) G is nondegenerately
multistationary, and (iii) β contains at least one positive and at least one negative coordinate.
Clearly, (ii) ⇒ (i), so we will complete the proof by showing (i) ⇒ (iii) ⇒ (ii).

To this end, take the 1/(y1 −ey1)-th root of (19), and call f the resulting function on D:

ey1 −y1 = x1(c2 + γ2x1)α2 . . . (cs + γsx1)αs ,

(21)

where αi := eyi−yi
ey1−y1

for i = 2, 3, . . . , s. Note that by construction, βi/β1 = γiαi (cf. Lemma 4.13).
Recall that our goal is to determine precisely when (for some values of K > 0 and ci ∈ R)
the equation f (x1) = K admits multiple roots x1 ∈ R that lie in the subinterval D of R>0
deﬁned by ci + γix1 > 0 for all i. As f > 0 on D, we can deﬁne the following function on D:

g(x1) := log f (x1) =

αi log (ci + γix1) ,

sXi=1

20

where c1 := 0, α1 := 1, and γ1 := 1. Here we compute g′ and g′′:

and ρi := 1/(ci + γix1) ,

Now, if f = K has a multiple root in D, then f ′ has a zero in D, and thus g′ does too
+, and thus β has at least

one positive and at least one negative coordinate. Hence, (i) ⇒ (iii).

For (iii) ⇒ (ii), assume that β contains both positive and negative coordinates. Thus, there

(22)

(23)

(24)

(26)

exists eρ ∈ Rs

>0 such that hB, eρi = 0. So, from (22),

We claim that it suﬃces to show that

hα, (γ ∗eρ)i = 0 .
hα, (γ ∗eρ) ∗ (γ ∗eρ)i 6= 0

>0 for which equation (25) also holds. This is because, via

for this eρ or another choice of eρ ∈ Rs
the change of coordinates (24) from eρ to ex1 andeci’s, this says that g′(ex1) = 0 and g′′(ex1) 6= 0
(recall (22) and (22)). Thus, g, and thus f as well, has a local extremum at ex1. If it is a local
minimum, then the equation f (x1) = f (ex1) + ǫ (for ǫ > 0 suﬃciently small) has multiple roots
x1 in D; if it is a local maximum, then f (x1) = f (ex1) − ǫ has multiple roots.
Thus, to complete the proof of (iii) ⇒ (ii), we must show that there exists eρ ∈ Rs

that (25) and (26) hold. Note that

{γ ∗eρ |eρ ∈ Rs

Therefore, we want to show that there exists v ∈ sign−1(γ) such that hα, vi = 0 and hα, v∗vi 6= 0.
This is the content of Lemma 5.7 below, and this completes the proof.

Lemma 5.7. Let α, γ ∈ Rs, where s ≥ 3. Assume that αi 6= 0 and γi 6= 0 for all i = 1, 2, . . . , s.
Let Cγ := sign−1(γ) denote the interior of the orthant in Rs that contains γ, and assume that
α⊥ ∩ Cγ is nonempty. Then there exists a vector v = (v1, v2, . . . , vs) ∈ α⊥ ∩ Cγ such that
v ∗ v := (v2

1, v2

2, . . . , v2

s ) /∈ α⊥.

Proof. Take w ∈ α⊥ ∩ Cγ. If w ∗ w /∈ α⊥, then we are done. Otherwise, we have:

hα, wi = hα, w ∗ wi = 0,

(27)

with sign(w) = sign(γ). We add an error term to w, and call this sum v:

v := w + (ǫ, . . . , ǫ, σǫ, ǫ′) = (w1 + ǫ, . . . , ws−2 + ǫ, ws−1 + σǫ, ws + ǫ′) .

Note that sign(v) = sign(w) for suﬃciently small ǫ and ǫ′ (when σ is ﬁxed). Then:

v ∗ v = w ∗ w + 2ǫw + 2ǫ(σ − 1)ws−1es−1 + 2(ǫ′ − ǫ)wses
+ ǫ2(1, 1, . . . , 1) + ǫ2(σ2 − 1)es−1 + (ǫ′2 − ǫ2)es ,

21

where ei is the i-th canonical basis vector in Rs. Let Γq :=Pq

hα, vi = ǫΓs−2 + σǫαs−1 + ǫ′αs

i=1 αi. Thus, using (27), we have:

hα, v ∗ vi = 2ǫ(σ − 1)αs−1ws−1 + 2(ǫ′ − ǫ)αsws + ǫ2Γs + ǫ2(σ2 − 1)αs−1 + (ǫ′2 − ǫ2)αs .

(28)

We consider two cases, based on whether Γs is zero. First, assume Γs 6= 0. Let σ = 1 and
ǫ′ = − ǫΓs−1
. By construction, the error term (ǫ, . . . , ǫ, σǫ, ǫ′) is in α⊥. Thus, because w ∈ α⊥
αs
and v is the sum of w and the error term, v ∈ α⊥, and thus v ∈ α⊥ ∩ Cγ when ǫ is suﬃciently
small. So, to complete the Γs 6= 0 case, we need only show that hα, v ∗ vi 6= 0 for some choice of
small ǫ. To this end, a straightforward computation that uses the properties (27) of w yields:

hα, v ∗ vi =

αiv2

i =

ǫΓs
αs

sXi=1

(ǫΓs−1 − 2wsαs) .

Thus, hα, v ∗ vi 6= 0 for suﬃciently small ǫ 6= 0 (because Γs 6= 0, αs 6= 0, and ǫΓs−1 − 2wsαs ≈
−2wsαs 6= 0: recall that sign(w) = sign(γ), which has no zero coordinates).

Now suppose that Γs = 0. There exists a pair of indices i and j such that αi 6= −αj (because
s ≥ 3 and α is nonzero). Relabel the indices if necessary, so that αs−1 6= −αs. Let σ = −1 and

αs (cid:19). As in the previous case, by construction, v ∈ α⊥ ∩ Cγ for suﬃciently small

ǫ′ = ǫ(cid:18)1 + 2

ǫ. Then by (28) and using Γs = 0, we have the following straightforward calculation:

αs−1

hα, v ∗ vi = − 4ǫαs−1ws−1 + 2(ǫ′ − ǫ)αsws + 0 + 0 + (ǫ′2 − ǫ2)αs

= 4ǫαs−1(cid:20)ws − ws−1 + ǫ(cid:18) αs−1 + αs

αs

(cid:19)(cid:21) .

(29)

Thus, hα, v ∗ vi 6= 0 for some small value of ǫ > 0, because αs−1 6= 0 and αs−1 6= −αs (so (29)
is not identically zero for all values of ǫ). Thus, the Γs = 0 case is done.

5.2 Networks with one irreversible and one reversible reaction

Theorem 5.8 below classiﬁes the multistationary networks that consist of one reversible reaction
and one irreversible reaction. Earlier, we classiﬁed the 1-species networks of this form (Theo-
rem 3.7). Such a network must be a 2-alternating network, which in this case means that the

reactions y ⇆ y′ and ey → ey′ satisfy either min{y, y′} < max{y, y′} < ey < ey′ (“⇆ →”, e.g.,
A ⇆ 2A, 3A → 4A) orey′ <ey < min{y, y′} < max{y, y′} (“← ⇆”).

Accordingly, Theorem 5.8 generalizes this 1-species result: a network with one reversible
reaction and one irreversible reaction is multistationary if and only if (1) it is consistent (which
we recall is required to admit even one positive steady state) and (2) one of the embedded
networks obtained by removing all but one species has the form “⇆ →” or “← ⇆”.

For instance, the network G = {B ⇆ A + 2B, 3A + B → 2A} is consistent, but removing 1
species yields {0 ⇆ A, 2A ← 3A} or {0 ← B ⇆ 2B}, neither of which has the form “⇆ →” or
“← ⇆” (these conditions require the 3 reactants to be distinct). Thus, G is not multistationary.
Much of Theorem 5.8 is due to Boros [4]. Our contribution is to reinterpret Boros’s multi-

stationarity criterion via the signs of the βi’s and via the geometry of the box diagram.

Theorem 5.8 (Classiﬁcation of multistationary networks with one reversible reaction and one
irreversible reaction). Let G be a network that consists of one reversible-reaction pair y ⇆ y′ and

Then the following are equivalent:

(1) G is multistationary (i.e., cappos(G) ≥ 2).

one irreversible reaction ey →ey′. For each species i = 1, 2, . . . , s, let βi := βi(y → y′, ey →ey′).
(2) y′ − y = −λ(ey′ −ey) for some 0 6= λ ∈ R, and after switching the roles of y and y′ if

necessary so that λ > 0, the inequality βi < 0 holds for some species i.

22

i}

obtained by removing all species except i is a 2-alternating network (“⇆ →” or “← ⇆”).

Proof. By Lemma 2.7, a necessary condition for multistationarity is that the reaction vectors

(3) y′ −y = −λ(ey′ −ey) for some 0 6= λ ∈ R, and max{yi, y′
i <eyi < min{yi, y′
(4) y′ −y = −λ(ey′ −ey) for some 0 6= λ ∈ R, and, for some species i, the embedded network of G
y′ −y, y −y′, andey′ −ey are positively linearly dependent. Therefore,ey′ −ey must be a (nontrivial)

scalar multiple of y′ − y. Under this assumption, Boros proved that when the four complexes are
distinct (i.e., the network has two linkage classes), the network is multistationary if and only if
min{yi, y′
i} holds for some i [4].
These inequalities are precisely the the max/min conditions in condition (3), once we note that
min{yi, y′
i} if
and only if yi 6= y′

i <eyi < min{yi, y′

i. In other words, (1)⇔(3) in the two-linkage-class case.

i} <eyi <ey′
i} if and only if eyi 6= ey′

To complete the proof of (1)⇔(3), we claim that if G has only one linkage class (and comprises
one reversible-reaction pair and one irreversible reaction), then G is not multistationary. Indeed,
such a network has deﬁciency zero or one, and has a unique terminal strong linkage class, so it
is not multistationary, by the deﬁciency zero or deﬁciency one theorem (Theorems 2.8 and 2.9).
Now we prove that (2)⇔(3). Assume that the reaction vectors are scalar multiples of each

i, and analogously min{eyi,ey′

i} < max{eyi,ey′

i or ey′

i} < max{yi, y′

where λ > 0.
inequality βi = (y′
turn holds if and only if y′
equivalent to the inequalities in condition (3) when λ > 0. Hence, (2)⇔(3).

(Such a switch does not aﬀect the inequalities in condition (3).) Then, the
i, which in
i (when λ > 0), and these are

i − yi)(eyi − yi) < 0 holds if and only if y′

i < yi <eyi or eyi < yi < y′

Finally, the equivalence (3)⇔(4) holds: min{yi, y′

“⇆ →”, and max{yi, y′

i} > min{yi, y′

i corresponds to “← ⇆”.

i < eyi < yi < y′

i} < max{yi, y′

i < yi < eyi < ey′

i corresponds to

i} <eyi <ey′

Remark 5.9. We wish to extend Theorem 5.8 to include a criterion for multistability. However,
at present, we do not know precisely which networks with 1 irreversible and 1 reversible reaction
are multistable. In the 1-species case, none are multistable (Theorem 3.7). For the 2-species
case, some are and some are not: {A ⇆ B, 2A + B → 3A} is bistable, but the related network
{A → B, 2A + B ⇆ 3A} is not (it admits 1 stable and 1 unstable positive steady state).

The following result is analogous to Corollaries 3.13 and 5.5 above:

Corollary 5.10. Suppose that G is an at-most-bimolecular reaction network. If G has exactly
one reversible and one irreversible reaction, then G is not nondegenerately multistationary.

Proof. A multistationary network with one reversible and one irreversible reaction must satisfy
i} ≥ 3. Hence,

condition (3) of Theorem 5.8. Thus, for some species i, eitherey′
at least one of the complexesey′, y, and y′ is not at-most-bimolecular.

Theorem 5.8 yields no new embedded-minimal multistationary networks:

i ≥ 3 or max{yi, y′

Corollary 5.11. A reaction network G that consists of exactly one reversible and one irre-
versible reaction is an embedding-minimal multistationary network if and only if G is a 2-
alternating network (equivalently, a 1-species network of the form “⇆→” or “←⇆”).

Proof. The implication ⇐ is an earlier result (Corollary 3.12). For ⇒, Theorem 5.8, speciﬁcally
part (4), states that G must contain a 2-alternating network as an embedded network.

5.3 Networks with two reversible reactions

We saw in the previous subsection that Theorem 5.8 generalizes the corresponding result for
1-species networks with 1 reversible and 1 irreversible reaction. Next we will see that the same is
true for networks with 2 reversible reactions (Theorem 5.12 below). Namely, the corresponding
1-species networks must be a 3-alternating network, which means here that it has the form
“⇆ ⇆”, e.g., A ⇆ 2A, 3A ⇆ 4A). Theorem 5.12 generalizes this 1-species result: a network

23

with two reversible reactions is multistationary if and only if (1) all the reaction vectors are
scalar multiples of each other (so, the system is 1-dimensional), and (2) one of the embedded
networks obtained by removing all but one species has the form “⇆ ⇆”.

For instance, the network {3A ⇆ 2A + B, A + 2B ⇆ 3B} is multistationary: up to scaling,
all the reaction vectors are (1, −1), and the embedded network obtained by removing A is
{0 ⇆ B, 2B ⇆ 3B}, which has the form “⇆ ⇆”. Among multistationary networks that are
mass-preserving, this network is one with the fewest numbers of species and complexes [34, §5].

Like Theorem 5.8, much of Theorem 5.12 is due to Boros [4].

Theorem 5.12 (Classiﬁcation of multistationary networks with two reversible reactions). Let

Then the following are equivalent:

min{yi, y′

i} < max{yi, y′

min{eyi,ey′

(1) G is multistationary (i.e., cappos(G) ≥ 2).

G be a network that consists of two reversible-reaction pairs, denoted by y ⇆ y′ and ey ⇆ ey′.
(2) y′ − y = −λ(ey′ −ey) for some 0 6= λ ∈ R, and, for some species i, either
i} < max{eyi,ey′
(3) y′ − y = −λ(ey′ −ey) for some 0 6= λ ∈ R, and, for some species i, the embedded network of

G obtained by removing all species except i is a 3-alternating network (“⇆ ⇆”).

i} < max{eyi,ey′

i} < min{eyi,ey′

i} < min{yi, y′

i}
i} < max{yi, y′
i} .

or

Proof. We claim that if G has only one linkage class, then it is not multistationary. Indeed,
such a network is weakly reversible and has deﬁciency zero or one, so by the deﬁciency zero or
deﬁciency one theorem (Theorems 2.8 and 2.9), respectively, G is not multistationary. Also, for
networks with one linkage class, then for all species i, one of the two inequalities in condition
(2) holds. Hence, we have proven (1)⇔(2) in the one-linkage-class case.

Now consider the two-linkage-class case (i.e., when the four complexes are distinct). If the

two reaction vectors y′ − y and ey′ −ey are not linearly dependent, then the network is weakly

reversible with deﬁciency zero, so is not multistationary by the deﬁciency zero theorem. When
the two reaction vectors are linearly dependent, Boros proved that the network is multistationary
if and only if condition (2) holds [4]. Hence, (1)⇔(2) in the two-linkage-class case.

It remains only to prove (2)⇔(3).

Indeed, the embedded network obtained by removing
all species except i is 3-alternating if and only if the four complexes (when projected to i) are
distinct and both (projected) complexes in one of the reversible-reaction pairs are strictly less
than those of the other pair. This condition is captured precisely by the inequalities in (2).

Remark 5.13. As in Remarks 5.4 and 5.9, we would like to extend Theorem 5.12 to include a
criterion for multistability.

The proof of the following result is essentially the same as that for Corollary 5.10 earlier:

Corollary 5.14. Suppose that G is an at-most-bimolecular reaction network. If G consists of
two reversible reactions, then G is not nondegenerately multistationary.

Example 5.15. The network {A + B ⇆ C, 2A ⇆ B} is at-most-bimolecular, so is not mul-
tistationary (Corollary 5.14). This also follows from Theorem 5.12: the reaction vectors are
not scalar multiples of each other. Moreover, the deﬁciency zero theorem guarantees a unique
positive steady state in each stoichiometric compatibility class; in fact this holds even for general
kinetics [2, Example 1].

Theorem 5.12 yields no embedded-minimal multistationary networks:

Corollary 5.16. Every reaction network G that consists of two pairs of reversible reactions is
not an embedding-minimal multistationary or multistable network.

Proof. Some embedded 1-species network of G has the form “⇆⇆” (Theorem 5.12). This
gives a further embedded network of the form “←⇆”, which is nondegenerately multistationary
(Corollary 3.12).

6 Discussion

Our work was motivated by Question 1.1: which reaction networks are multistationary? We
do not expect an easy answer to this question in general, as there is likely no ﬁnite criterion
for multistationarity. Nevertheless, we succeeded in answering this question for networks with
1 species or up to 2 reactions, each possibly reversible.

Our results point the way forward for analyzing larger networks: the geometry of reaction

diagrams will play a key role, as will sign conditions on the βi(y → y′,ey →ey′)’s. Indeed, although

the multistationary networks analyzed here may not appear often in applications (none are at-
most-bimolecular), many of the techniques we used to assess multistationarity apply to more
general networks.

Similar techniques may help answer a few questions raised by our work. First, among those
networks we analyzed for which the stoichiometric subspace is 1-dimensional, the multistationary
ones are precisely the ones with an embedded 1-species network of the form “←→” and one of
the form “→←”. We ask now whether this holds more generally:

Question 6.1. Consider a network G with 1-dimensional stoichiometric subspace. For G to be
multistationary, is it necessary for G to have an embedded 1-species network of the form “←→”
and one of the form “→←”? Is it suﬃcient?

We also recall questions posed in Remarks 5.4, 5.9, and 5.13:

Question 6.2. Which networks that consist of (a) 2 irreversible reactions, (b) 1 irreversible
and 1 reversible reaction, or (c) 2 reversible reactions, are multistable?

Moreover, these questions point to a larger gap in the theory: methods exist for assessing
multistationarity, but few can establish multistability or even nondegenerate multistationarity.
Our results form a step in this direction: the classiﬁcation of small nondegenerately multista-
tionary networks (and many of the multistable ones) hints that a careful analysis of reaction
diagrams may yield a general criterion (necessary or suﬃcient conditions) for bistability.
