DUNKL HARMONIC ANALYSIS

AND FUNDAMENTAL SETS OF FUNCTIONS

ON THE UNIT SPHERE

Roman A. Veprintsev

Abstract. Using Dunkl theory, we introduce into consideration some weighted Lp-spaces on [−1, 1] and on
the unit Euclidean sphere Sd−1, d ≥ 2. Then we deﬁne a family of linear bounded operators {V p
κ (x) : x ∈ Sd−1}
acting from the Lp-space on [−1, 1] to the Lp-space on Sd−1, 1 ≤ p < ∞. We establish a necessary and
suﬃcient condition for a function g belonging to the Lp-space on [−1, 1] such that the family of functions
{V p

κ (x; g) : x ∈ Sd−1} is fundamental in the Lp-space on Sd−1.

1. Introduction and preliminaries

In this section we introduce some basic deﬁnitions and notions of general Dunkl theory
(see, e.g., [2–6]); for a background on reﬂection groups and root systems the reader is referred
to [6, 8].

Let N0 be the set of nonnegative integers, let Rd be the d-dimensional real Euclidean space
of all d-tuples of real numbers. For x ∈ Rd, we write x = (x1, . . . , xd). The inner product of

x, y ∈ Rd is denoted by hx, yi =

d

Pi=1

xiyi, and the norm of x is denoted by kxk = phx, xi.

Let Sd−1 = {x : kxk = 1} be the unit sphere in Rd, d ≥ 2. Denote by dω the usual Lebesgue
measure on Sd−1.

For a nonzero vector v ∈ Rd, deﬁne the reﬂection sv by

sv(x) = x − 2

hx, vi
kvk2 v,

x ∈ Rd.

Each reﬂection sv is contained in the orthogonal group O(Rd).

Recall that a ﬁnite set R ⊂ Rd \ {0} is called a root system if the following conditions

are satisﬁed:

(1) R ∩ Rv = {±v} for all v ∈ R;

(2) sv(R) = R for all v ∈ R.

The subgroup G = G(R) ⊂ O(Rd) which is generated by the reﬂections {sv : v ∈ R} is called
the reﬂection group associated with R. It is known that the reﬂection group G is ﬁnite and
the set of reﬂections contained in G is exactly {sv : v ∈ R}.

Each root system R can be written as a disjoint union R = R+ ∪ (−R+), where R+ and
−R+ are separated by a hyperplane through the origin. Such a set R+ is called a positive
subsystem. Its choice in not unique.

A nonnegative function κ on a root system R is called a multiplicity function if it is

G-invariant, i.e. κ(v) = κ(g(v)) for all v ∈ R, g ∈ G.

Note that deﬁnitions given below do not depend on the special choice of R+, thanks to

the G-invariance of κ.

The Dunkl operators are deﬁned by

Dif (x) =

∂f (x)

∂xi

+ Xv∈R+

κ(v)

f (x) − f (sv(x))

hv, xi

vi,

1 ≤ i ≤ d.

In case κ = 0, the Dunkl operators reduce to the corresponding partial derivatives. These
operators were introduced and ﬁrst studied by C. F. Dunkl.

Let

λκ = γκ +

d − 2

2

,

γκ = Xv∈R+

κ(v),

let wκ denote the weight function on Sd−1 deﬁned by

wκ(x) = Yv∈R+

|hv, xi|2κ(v),

x ∈ Sd−1.

The weight function wκ is a positively homogeneous G-invariant function of degree 2γκ. In
case κ = 0, wκ is identically equal to 1.

Suppose Πd is the space of all polynomials in d variables with complex coeﬃcients, P d

n is

the subspace of homogeneous polynomials of degree n ∈ N0 in d variables.

C. F. Dunkl has proved in [5] that there exists a unique linear isomorphism Vκ of Πd such

that

Vκ(P d

n) = P d

n, n ∈ N0,

Vκ1 = 1,

DiVκ = Vκ

∂
∂xi

, 1 ≤ i ≤ d.

This operator is called the Dunkl intertwining operator. The operator Vκ was studied by
many mathematicians (for example, C. F. Dunkl, M. R¨osler, K. Trim`eche, Y. Xu). If κ = 0,
then Vκ is the identity operator.

Throughout this paper, we assume that p ∈ [1, ∞) and λκ > 0. In particular, it follows

that γκ > 0 if d = 2.

To explain our main result of the present paper, we need to introduce some weighted

Lp-spaces and one family of linear operators.

Denote by Lκ,p(Sd−1) the space of complex-valued Lebesgue measurable functions f on

Sd−1 with ﬁnite norm

kf kκ,p,Sd−1 = (cid:16)ZSd−1

|f (x)|p dσκ(x)(cid:17)1/p

,

dσκ(x) = aκ wκ(x) dω(x),

where the normalizing constant aκ satisﬁes aκRSd−1 wκ dω = 1. The space Lκ,2(Sd−1) is a

complex Hilbert space with the inner product

hf, hiκ,Sd−1 = ZSd−1

f (x)h(x) dσκ(x).

We also introduce the space Lκ,∞(Sd−1) composed of all complex-valued Lebesgue measur-
able functions deﬁned on Sd−1 which are σκ-measurable and σκ-essentially bounded. Because
wκ is ω-a.e. nonzero on Sd−1, the above notions coincides with the one of wκ-measurable
and wκ-essentially bounded function, respectively.

Let λ > 0. Suppose Lp,λ[−1, 1] is the space of complex-valued Lebesgue measurable

functions g on the segment [−1, 1] with ﬁnite norm

kgkλ,p,[−1,1] = (cid:16)cλZ 1

.

The Gegenbauer polynomials C λ

n (see, e.g., [1, p. 302]) are orthogonal with respect to the
weight function (1 − t2)λ−1/2. For a function g ∈ Lp,λ[−1, 1], its Gegenbauer expansion takes
the form

Theorem 13.17 in [7] says that Lκ,q(Sd−1) ⊂ Lκ,p(Sd−1) and Lq,λ[−1, 1] ⊂ Lp,λ[−1, 1] for

1 ≤ p < q < ∞.

Let us now consider the operators

κ (x) : Lp,λκ[−1, 1] → Lκ,p(Sd−1)
V p
depending on x ∈ Sd−1 which are deﬁned by the following rule:

V p

κ (x; g, y) = Vκ(cid:2)g(hx, ·i)(cid:3)(y),

y ∈ Sd−1

(cid:0)g ∈ Lp,λκ[−1, 1](cid:1).

They are linear bounded operators with operator norm 1. It follows from the properties of
Vκ known from the general Dunkl theory (see especially the proof of Theorem 7.4.2 in [2])
that these operators are well deﬁned.

The main result of this paper is a generalization of Theorem 2.4 in [10]. More precisely,
we establish a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a function g ∈ Lp,λκ[−1, 1] such that the
family of functions

Mp

κ(g) = {V p

κ (x; g) : x ∈ Sd−1}

(2)

is fundamental in the space Lκ,p(Sd−1). This fact is formulated and proved in section 3.

Recall that a set F in a Banach space E is said to be fundamental if the linear span of F
is dense in E. To prove the main result, we use a consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem
related to fundamentality of sets in normed linear spaces. We include it as a separate lemma
for convenience.

Lemma 1. Let F be a subset of a Banach space E . In order that F be fundamental
in E , it is necessary and suﬃcient that F not be annihilated by a nonzero bounded linear
functional on E .

2. Some facts of Dunkl harmonic analysis on the unit sphere

The Dunkl Laplacian ∆κ is deﬁned by

∆κ =

and it plays the role similar to that of the ordinary Laplacian. It reduces to the ordinary
Laplacian provided that κ = 0.

n such that ∆κP = 0.

A κ-harmonic polynomial P of degree n ∈ N0 in d variables is a homogeneous polynomial
P ∈ P d
Its restriction to the unit sphere is called the κ-spherical
harmonic of degree n in d variables. Denote by Ad
n(κ) the space of κ-spherical harmonics
of degree n in d variables. The κ-spherical harmonics of diﬀerent degrees turn out to be
orthogonal with respect to the weighted inner product h·, ·iκ,Sd−1 [3, Theorem 1.6].

Let C(Sd−1) be the space of complex-valued continuous functions on Sd−1.

1 ≤ p < ∞. So it is suﬃcient to show that

n(κ) is fundamental in C(Sd−1).

By the Weierstrass approximation theorem, if f is continuous on Sd−1, then it can be
uniformly approximated by polynomials restricted to Sd−1. According to [3, Theorem 1.7],

these restrictions belong to the linear span of

C(Sd−1).

Equality (3) is the Funk – Hecke formula for κ-spherical harmonics written in our setting

and designations (cf. [2, Theorem 7.2.7], [13, Theorem 2.1]).

3. Main result: proof and its consequence

We can now state and prove the main theorem.

Theorem 1. Let d ≥ 2, 1 ≤ p < ∞. Fix a root system R in Rd and a multiplicity
κ(g) (2) be fundamental in

function κ on R. Let g ∈ Lp,λκ[−1, 1]. In order that the set Mp

P r o o f. We ﬁrst prove that the condition is suﬃcient. Let Φ be a bounded linear
functional on Lκ,p(Sd−1) which annihilates Mp
κ(g). According to the Riesz representation
theorem [11, Theorem 6.16], Φ can be written as follows: Φ( · ) = h · , hiκ,Sd−1, where h ∈
∈ Lκ,q(Sd−1) and q is the exponent conjugate to p (p−1 + q−1 = 1; q = ∞ whenever p = 1).
Then the annihilating property of Φ reduces to

ZSd−1

V p
κ (x; g, y) h(y) dσκ(y) = 0,

x ∈ Sd−1.

Next, we multiply both sides of the previous equality by Y κ
n(κ), n ∈ N0, and
integrate the resulting expression with respect to the measure dσκ. H¨older’s inequality
implies that V p
n (x) is σκ × σκ-integrable over Sd−1 × Sd−1, and hence, using
the Fubini theorem to interchange the order of integration, we get

κ (x; g, y) h(y) Y κ

n (x) ∈ Ad

ZSd−1

h(y)(cid:18)ZSd−1

κ (x; g, y) Y κ
V p

n (x) dσκ(x)(cid:19) dσκ(y) = 0.

Using the symmetric relation [9, formula (7)]

Vκ(cid:2)g(hx, ·i)(cid:3)(y) = Vκ(cid:2)g(hy, ·i)(cid:3)(x) σκ × σκ-a.e. on Sd−1 ×Sd−1

and the Funk – Hecke formula (3), we obtain

Λn,λκ(g) hY κ

n , hiκ,Sd−1 = 0,

Y κ
n ∈ Ad

n(κ), n ∈ N0.

It follows from the condition that

hY κ

n , hiκ,Sd−1 = 0,

Y κ
n ∈ Ad

n(κ), n ∈ N0.

Thus, Φ annihilates

Therefore, the set Mp

Ad

n(κ). By continuity of Φ and Lemma 2, Φ = 0 on Lκ,p(Sd−1).

Sn=0
κ(g) is fundamental in Lκ,p(Sd−1) by Lemma 1.

Let us now prove that the condition described in the theorem is necessary. Assume, to
reach a contradiction, that there exists an index m ∈ N0 such that Λm,λκ(g) = 0. Select
any nontrivial κ-spherical harmonic Y κ
m(κ) and consider a measure µ deﬁned on the
Lebesgue subsets L of Sd−1 by the rule

m ∈ Ad

µ(B) = ZB

Y κ
m(x) σκ(x), B ∈ L.

This measure is nontrivial by its deﬁnition.

Using the Funk – Hecke formula (3), we obtain

ZSd−1

κ (x; g, y) dµ(y) = ZSd−1

κ (x; g, y) Y κ
V p

m(y) dσκ(y)

m(x) = 0,

x ∈ Sd−1.

Thus, the nontrivial bounded linear functional Φ1 on Lκ,p(Sd−1) given by Φ1(f ) = RSd−1 f dµ
κ(g) is not fundamental in Lκ,p(Sd−1). This contradicts

The above proof is exactly like that of Theorem 2.4 in [10]. Using the scheme of the
