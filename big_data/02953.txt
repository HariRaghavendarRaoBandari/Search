The statistics of the velocity gradient tensor in turbulent ﬂows are of both theoretical and
practical importance. The Lagrangian view provides a privileged perspective for studying
the dynamics of turbulence in general, and of the velocity gradient tensor in particular.
Stochastic models for the Lagrangian evolution of velocity gradients in isotropic turbu-
lence, with closure models for the pressure Hesssian and viscous Laplacian, have been
shown to reproduce important features such as non-Gaussian probability distributions,
skewness and vorticity strain-rate alignments. The Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD)
closure introduced the idea of mapping an isotropic Lagrangian pressure Hessian as
upstream initial condition using the ﬂuid deformation tensor. Recent work on a Gaussian
ﬁelds closure, however, has shown that even Gaussian isotropic velocity ﬁelds contain
signiﬁcant anisotropy for the conditional pressure Hessian tensor due to the inherent
velocity-pressure couplings, and that assuming an isotropic pressure Hessian as upstream
condition may not be realistic. In this paper, Gaussian isotropic ﬁeld statistics are used to
generate more physical upstream conditions for the recent ﬂuid deformation mapping. In
this new framework, known isotropy relations can be satisﬁed a priori and no DNS-tuned
coeﬃcients are necessary. A detailed comparison of results from the new model, referred
to as the recent deformation of Gaussian ﬁelds (RDGF) closure, with existing models
and DNS shows the improvements gained, especially in various single-time statistics of
the velocity gradient tensor at moderate Reynolds numbers. Application to arbitrarily
high Reynolds numbers remains an open challenge for this type of model, however.

1. Introduction

The statistics of velocity gradients in isotropic turbulence are of both practical and
theoretical importance in the study of turbulent ﬂows (Sreenivasan & Antonia 1997;
Wallace 2009). The hypothesis of approximate local isotropy at suﬃciently high Reynolds
number (Kolmogorov 1941) provides an important framework for exploring universality
of small-scale statistics, including velocity gradients, across a wide range of ﬂows. It
is well accepted that the dynamics of turbulence, including velocity gradients, can be
better understood in a Lagrangian frame following the ﬂow (Falkovich et al. 2001; Toschi
& Bodenschatz 2009). Also, in many practical situations, the velocity gradient along
Lagrangian or inertial particle paths determines the dynamics of sub-Kolmogorov scale
objects immersed in turbulent ﬂows, such as the deformation and break-up of bubbles
and immiscible drops (Biferale et al. 2010; Maniero et al. 2012; Biferale et al. 2014), the

stretching of polymers (Balkovsky et al. 2000; Chertkov 2000; Bagheri et al. 2012), the
rotation rate and nutrient uptake of small swimming organisms (Batchelor 1980; Pedley
& Kessler 1992; Karp-Boss et al. 1996; Parsa et al. 2012; Chevillard & Meneveau 2013),
and hemolysis in red-blood cells (Arora et al. 2004; Behbahani et al. 2009; De Tullio et al.
2012), among other applications.

Meanwhile, from a theoretical perspective, the statistics of velocity gradients and incre-
ments in isotropic turbulence are key ingredients in exploring internal intermittency and
multi-fractality (Kolmogorov 1962; Oboukhov 1962; Parisi & Frisch 1985; Meneveau &
Sreenivasan 1991). In recent decades, the Lagrangian view of intermittency in turbulence
has become a topic of increasing interest (Falkovich et al. 2001; Toschi & Bodenschatz
2009). The energy cascade has been posed in the Lagrangian frame (Meneveau & Lund
1994; Yu & Meneveau 2010) and Lagrangian multi-fractality has been explored (Boﬀetta
et al. 2002; Chevillard et al. 2003; Biferale et al. 2004, 2008; Arn`eodo et al. 2008).
While analysis methods for dynamical systems are often impractical because of the
high-dimensionality of turbulent ﬂows (Frisch 1995), tools such as ﬁnite-time Lyapunov
exponents are useful in the Lagrangian frame for studying chaotic advection (Ottino
1989) and coherent structures (Haller 2000; Haller & Yuan 2000; Green et al. 2007;
Haller 2015).

The evolution of velocity gradients along Lagrangian paths contains two unclosed
terms requiring models: the deviatoric part of the pressure Hessian and the viscous
Laplacian. Removal of these two terms results in the restricted Euler equation, which
has the unfortunate property of leading to a ﬁnite-time singularity (Vieillefosse 1982,
1984; Cantwell 1992). The term driving the singularity is the quadratic self-ampliﬁcation
of velocity gradients that is kinematic in nature. The unclosed terms are evidently
responsible for opposing the restricted Euler singularity. A number of studies have shed
some light on the dynamics of velocity gradients along Lagrangian paths, exploring
invariant spaces and the unclosed terms (Nomura & Post 1998; Martin et al. 1998a;
Ooi et al. 1999; L¨uthi et al. 2009; Lawson & Dawson 2015).

Meanwhile, as reviewed in Meneveau (2011), attempts at closure models for the ODE
governing the Lagrangian evolution of the velocity gradient tensor have enjoyed some
success. The addition of a linear relaxation term eliminates the singularity for some initial
conditions, but not for all (Martin et al. 1998b). Girimaji & Pope (1990) introduced
a model for the pressure Hessian and viscous Laplacian designed to reproduce log-
normal statistics for the pseudo-dissipation by construction. Jeong & Girimaji (2003)
constructed a non-linear relaxation model for the viscous Laplacian using the trace of
the inverse Cauchy-Green tensor, neglecting the deviatoric part of the pressure Hessian.
Chevillard & Meneveau (2006) and Chevillard et al. (2008) used the insight of Jeong
and Girimaji’s viscous Laplacian and the tetrad model of Chertkov et al. (1999) to
introduce the Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD) approximation, providing closure for both
the viscous Laplacian and the deviatoric part of the pressure Hessian. The underlying
concept in the RFD model is that the conditional pressure Hessian can be approximated
by considering an initially isotropic tensor subjected to ﬂuid deformation for a short
time using a constant velocity gradient. It was demonstrated that the RFD closure was
able to prevent the singularity and the resulting system could thus reproduce many well-
known velocity gradient characteristics, including trends over a small range of moderate
Re λ (Chevillard & Meneveau 2006; Chevillard et al. 2008; Chevillard & Meneveau
2011). Increasing the Reynolds number further, however, led to unphysical results, which
were studied in some detail (Martins-Afonso & Meneveau 2010). Meanwhile, Suman &
Girimaji (2009, 2011) have worked on a similar modeling approach for the Lagrangian
velocity gradient evolution in compressible ﬂows .

Lagrangian velocity gradient closure

3

Wilczek & Meneveau (2014) took a diﬀerent approach to closure, using a Gaussian
ﬁelds (GF) assumption to compute directly the conditional averages of the deviatoric part
of the pressure Hessian and viscous Laplacian in incompressible, isotropic turbulence.
When using the resulting pressure Hessian from the GF model, however, Wilczek &
Meneveau (2014) found that the model was too weak to prevent the singularity. To make
the model work, the Gaussian-derived coeﬃcients were tuned empirically using stochastic
estimation based on DNS data. The resulting Enhanced Gaussian Fields (EGF) closure
with the ﬁtted parameters provided good predictions of velocity gradient statistics,
rivaling those of the RFD model.

The GF closure thus elucidated an important point, that even in an isotropic Gaussian
velocity ﬁeld, the conditional pressure Hessian tensor is not an isotropic tensor. In
this paper, we propose that the initial conditions for a recent deformation closure are
better represented by those of an isotropic Gaussian velocity ﬁeld than by assuming an
isotropic tensor as in the RFD closure. With this insight, we develop a new pressure
Hessian and viscous Laplacian model based on a recent-deformation mapping closure for
incompressible turbulence that assumes the initial condition of the mapping to be an
isotropic Gaussian velocity ﬁeld.

More detailed background on the RFD and GF/EGF closures is presented brieﬂy in
§2. Following that, the new model based on recent deformations of Gaussian ﬁelds is
introduced and explained in §3. After a brief explanation in §4 of numerical methods for
the stochastic ODEs and for the DNS data to which results are compared, an examination
of results is given in §5. The results of the new model are compared alongside RFD and
EGF results with DNS data, and afterward appropriate conclusions are drawn.

2. Background

In this section, the equations for the Lagrangian evolution of the velocity gradient
tensor are brieﬂy summarized. After that, the closure approach based on the Fokker-
Planck equation for the velocity gradient is reviewed. Within this paradigm, the prior
RFD and GF closure models are explained.

2.1. Lagrangian Velocity Gradient Evolution

In this paper, we consider incompressible, Newtonian ﬂuids with arbitrary solenoidal
forcing. The gradient of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations gives the evolution
equation for velocity gradient tensor, Aij = ∂ui

where d

is the trace-free gradient of the forcing. The

ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is the non-linear self-ampliﬁcation term, which leads
to the restricted Euler dynamics and a ﬁnite-time singularity (Vieillefosse 1982, 1984;
Cantwell 1992). While this self-ampliﬁcation term is closed, the pressure Hessian and
viscous Laplacian terms are unclosed, requiring information from neighboring Lagrangian
trajectories.

The incompressibility constraint, i.e. that the velocity gradient tensor should be trace-
free, can be incorporated by evaluating the trace of the velocity gradient evolution
equation, which yields the pressure Poisson equation, Pkk = 2Q, where Q ≡ − 1
2 Ak(cid:96)A(cid:96)k.
Solving the pressure Poisson equation and twice taking the gradient leads to (Ohkitani

This tensor equation represents 9 diﬀerential equations for the 9 components of the

The velocity gradient tensor can be written as a sum of symmetric and anti-symmetric
parts, Aij = Sij + Ωij, where Sij = 1

2.2. Stochastic Model

In order to model the Lagrangian evolution of the velocity gradient, a stochastic rep-
resentation is taken (Girimaji & Pope 1990; Chevillard et al. 2008; Wilczek & Meneveau
2014). The stochastic approach is built on the evolution equation for the single-time
probability density function (PDF) for the velocity gradient tensor,

which provides a model for the Lagrangian velocity gradient dynamics provided the
two conditional averages and the stochastic noise term can be speciﬁed. The stochastic

(cid:104)dWijdWk(cid:96)(cid:105) = δikδj(cid:96)dt, with diﬀusion tensor Dijk(cid:96) = bijmnbk(cid:96)mn.

In this system, Ωij has three independent variables with the requirement to remain
anti-symmetric and Sij has ﬁve independent variables with the requirement to remain
symmetric and trace-free. The symmetric and anti-symmetric stochastic forcing terms,
in this view, can be chosen independent of each other and obeying these constraints. The
details of the stochastic forcing term are given in Appendix A.

2.3. Recent Fluid Deformation Closure

The central idea in the RFD closure approach Chevillard & Meneveau (2006) is to
introduce a coordinate mapping based on material volume deformation in the recent

Lagrangian history. Deﬁning a Lagrangian trajectory as a map, Tt0,t : X ∈ R3 (cid:55)→ x ∈ R3,
from an initial condition X at time t0 to a position x at a later time t, then the Lagrangian
trajectory evolves according to dxi
dt = ui(x, t), with initial condition xi(t0) = Xi, where
the velocity ﬁeld, u(x, t), is a solution to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with
appropriate boundary and initial conditions.

The evolution of an inﬁnitesimal ﬂuid volume in the vicinity of x can be described by
the deformation tensor, Dij = ∂xi/∂Xj, which is the sensitivity of the trajectory to initial
position and evolves as dDij
dt = AikDkj with initial condition Dij(X, t0) = δij. The general
solution to this equation involves the time-ordered exponential, but approximating that
the velocity gradient is constant for short time,

D(x, t; X, t0) ≈ exp [A(x, t)(t − t0)] .

(2.10)

Instead of directly attempting to close the conditional averages in (2.7), ﬁrst the approx-
imate ﬂuid deformation tensor is used to strain the coordinate system,

where (cid:101)Pij represents an approximation for the pressure Hessian at a previous time along

the Lagrangian path and D−1
ij = ∂Xi/∂xj ≈ (exp [−A(x, t)(t − t0)])ij. This is akin
to assuming the pressure approximately constant along pathlines for a short time (in
the sense of conditional averages on A), so that the changes in the conditional pressure
Hessian are due entirely to the relative movement of neighboring ﬂuid trajectories induced
by the local velocity gradient. In this way, the closure of the conditional pressure Hessian
requires the speciﬁcation of initial conditions of the pressure Hessian upstream along the
Lagrangian path.

(2.11)

The strongest assumption in the RFD model comes next, in assuming the initial
condition for the mapping, i.e. the upstream conditional pressure Hessian, to be an
isotropic tensor,

This form of the conditional pressure Hessian is appealing due to its simplicity and
the intuition that the statistical bias of the pressure Hessian is related to the recent
deformation of ﬂuid particles by the velocity gradient tensor. However, as will be recalled
later, even isotropic Gaussian velocity ﬁelds contain anisotropic contributions for the
conditional pressure Hessian, casting some doubts onto (2.12) above.

The RFD model treats the viscous Laplacian in the same way,

In this way, the recent deformation provides a physically motivated mechanistic approach
to introduce non-linearity in the viscous Laplacian term, which helpful in removing
the ﬁnite-time singularity (the Cauchy-Green tensor is exponential rather than linear).
Chevillard & Meneveau (2006) and Chevillard et al. (2008) argue that the proper
relaxation timescale, T , for the viscous Laplacian is the integral timescale, and that
the proper timescale for the recent deformation is the Kolmogorov timescale, t− t0 = τη.
In this way, the model introduces Re λ ∼ (T /τη) eﬀects. Indeed, certain intermittency
trends are reproduced by this model (Chevillard & Meneveau 2006) at moderate Re λ, but
continuing to increase Re λ beyond a certain threshold leads to increasingly unphysical
results (Martins-Afonso & Meneveau 2010). Nonetheless, the RFD closure provides
a model that reproduced many of the known trends of velocity gradient statistics
at moderate Re λ, and continues to be useful for studying velocity gradient statistics
(Moriconi et al. 2014).

Wilczek & Meneveau (2014) took a diﬀerent approach to closing the conditional
averages. They assumed that the velocity ﬁeld has joint-Gaussian N-point PDFs with

prescribed spectral (two-point) statistics (the pressure ﬁeld constructed from such a
velocity ﬁeld is not necessarily Gaussian). They computed the conditional averages using
this approximation by employing the characteristic functional of a Gaussian velocity
ﬁeld and obtaining an exact analytical result for the conditional pressure Hessian for a
Gaussian velocity ﬁeld

In this expression, α and β are independent of Re λ while γ is expected to have weak
Re λ-dependence through the integral of the correlation function derivatives. Using a
model spectrum at Re λ = 430, a numerical result of γ ≈ 0.08 was obtained (Wilczek &
Meneveau 2014) .
Furthermore, the conditional viscous Laplacian could also be computed for Gaussian

Note that δ < 0 for realistic correlation functions, meaning that the Gaussian approx-
imation leads to a linear damping model as in Martin et al. (1998b) for the viscous
Laplacian. Numerical evaluation using a model spectrum at Re λ = 430 gave the result
δ ≈ −0.65/τη. Using the above Gaussian-derived functional form but invoking in addition
the balance of enstrophy production and dissipation with its relationship to skewness,
Wilczek & Meneveau (2014) related the coeﬃcient γ to the velocity derivative skewness,

a result which gave much better agreement values estimated from DNS at Re λ = 430,
namely δ ≈ −0.15/τη, when using realistic values for the skewness (non-zero, i.e. non-
Gaussian). Because the original Gaussian closure led to a singularity when integrated
numerically, the authors considered an alternative model in which the functional form
of the Gaussian closure was retained by the coeﬃcients were empirically obtained by
estimating them from DNS results: α = −0.61, β = −0.65, γ = 0.14, δ = −0.15/τη.
With these empirically-adjusted coeﬃcients, statistical stationarity was achieved and
many of the known trends for velocity gradient statistics were reproduced with this
approach termed the Enhanced Gaussian Fields (EGF) closure.

3. Recent Deformation of Gaussian Fields Mapping Closure

This section introduces the RDGF closure for the pressure Hessian and viscous Lapla-
cian terms in the Lagrangian stochastic evolution equation for the velocity gradient
tensor.

3.1. Overview

As summarized before, a strong assumption underlying the RFD approximation was
the assumption that the initial upstream condition of the conditional pressure Hessian
(and viscous Laplacian) are isotropic tensors. Here we relax this strong assumption and
instead assume that the upstream conditional pressure Hessian is that of an isotropic
Gaussian velocity ﬁeld. In this way, (2.12) is modiﬁed as follows

where the latter term is evaluated using (2.20). Similarly for the viscous term, the
conditional Hessian of the upstream velocity gradient is no longer assumed isotropic, and
(2.17) is modiﬁed to include the anisotropic contributions from the Gaussian closure. The
same mapping as in the RFD model is applied to convert the upstream initial conditions
to the resulting closure. Figure 1 illustrates the overall procedure for constructing the
model for the pressure Hessian. A similar procedure is used for the viscous Laplacian.

We name this approach the Recent Deformation of Gaussian Fields (RDGF) model. In
the sense of this nomenclature, the term ‘Gaussian ﬁelds’ is used to refer to the Gaussian
velocity ﬁeld along with its associated (non-Gaussian) pressure ﬁeld. For the pressure
Hessian, the recent deformation mapping is applied to the pressure ﬁeld derived from
Gaussian velocity ﬁeld.

The underlying phenomenology of the RDGF model is that approximate turbulence
statistics can be developed eﬃciently by a mapping of Gaussian statistics. This motivation
is similar to the ideas behind the mapping closures (Chen et al. 1989; Kraichnan 1990;
Pope 1991), as well as the multiscale turnover Lagrangian map (MTLM) procedure of
Rosales & Meneveau (2008) to generate non-Gaussian synthetic turbulence ﬁelds.

3.2. Model Details

The model for the unclosed terms along the Lagrangian path at point x (time t) involves
applying the Gaussian ﬁelds approximation at the upstream point X (time t − τ ). For
the deviatoric part of the pressure Hessian, using (2.20),

Similarly, the Gaussian ﬁelds approximation for the upstream Hessian of the velocity

gradient uses the results of Appendix C,

It can be easily shown that contraction with δpq recovers (2.22) and contraction with
δij, δip, or δiq causes the term to vanish in accordance with incompressibility. Following

Note that the present model does not use the coeﬃcients estimated from DNS. Instead,
the coeﬃcients are used as derived from the Gaussian ﬁeld statistics.

In some sense, this model can be seen as a generalization of both RFD and GF closures.
To recover the RFD model, ﬁrst the back-in-time deviatoric component of the pressure
Hessian should be removed, Gij = 0, i.e. α = β = γ = 0. Then, including only the
−1
isotropic part of (3.3) gives ν∇2Aij = δ C
3 Aij, and the coeﬃcient should be set to
kk
δ = − 1
T , where T is the integral timescale. This roughly corresponds to the RFD model
T = − 7S
at τK
15 ≈ 0.18. To recover the GF model, the deformation tensor should be set
to identity, Dij = δij.

3.4. Parameters and Constraints

The model now contains three parameters that have yet to be determined: Ds,
Da, and τ . As discussed in more detail in Appendix A, the stochastic forcing term,
dFij = bijk(cid:96)dWk(cid:96), can be split into symmetric and anti-symmetric parts, each with its
own amplitude. This can be thought of as separately forcing Eqs (2.8) and (2.9). The
amplitudes of the symmetric and anti-symmetric stochastic forcing tensors, Ds and Da,
are two parameters that must be set to fully specify the model.

Additionally, the time interval of the mapping, τ , must be set. In keeping with the
RFD phenomenology, it is expected that this should be τ ∼ O(τη). The RFD model
used τ = τK, where τK is an input Kolmogorov timescale, but a posteriori evaluation
at τK
T = 0.1 reveals that the actual Kolmogorov timescale produced by the model is

Lagrangian velocity gradient closure

11
τη ≈ 2.0τK. Therefore, the eﬀective time interval was τ ≈ 0.5τη, based on the actual
velocity gradient statistics produced by the model.
The three free parameters can be set by a choice of three constraints. First, without
loss of generality, considering the evolution of the dimensionless velocity gradient tensor,
(cid:104)SijSij(cid:105) = 1
2 . This constraint eﬀectively guarantees that the deﬁnition of δ in terms of τη is
consistent. For the other two constraints, it is desirable to pick relationships for isotropic
turbulence with analytical derivation, which can be considered a priori constraints. It is
natural, then, to pick the two Betchov relations (Betchov 1956), (cid:104)Q(cid:105) = (cid:104)R(cid:105) = 0. In light
of the aforementioned dimensionless form of the equation, the former can be rephrased
as (cid:104)ΩijΩij(cid:105) = 1
2 .
The determination of the three parameters using the three constraints can be posed
as a three-dimensional root-ﬁnding problem. The appropriate values for the parameters
were found empirically by numerical solutions of the model (see §4.1 below for details)
using Broyden’s method (Press et al. 1992). The procedure involved iteratively adjusting
Ds, Da, and τ and evaluating suﬃciently converged statistics of (cid:104)SijSij(cid:105), (cid:104)ΩijΩij(cid:105) and
(cid:104)R(cid:105) from the numerical solutions of the model until the constraints were satisﬁed with
the desired accuracy (four decimal places). The iterative method for determining the
correct model parameters converges toward,

Ds = 0.1014/τ 3
η ,

Da = 0.0505/τ 3
η ,

τ = 0.1302τη.

(3.17)

The mapping time is considerably shorter than that of RFD closure because the addi-
tional deviatoric part of the pressure Hessian was added to the RFD model, which was
by itself already strong enough to counter the singularity with τ ≈ 0.5τη.

4. Numerical Methods

4.1. Stochastic Diﬀerential Equation Solver

The three models introduced in the previous sections (RFD, EGF and RDGF) can
be advanced numerically as a system of stochastic ODEs. A second-order predictor-
corrector method is used for time advancement. Time steps of size dt/τη = 0.04, 0.02,
and 0.01 are compared to verify discretization convergence. Ensembles of 216 trajectories
are advanced for 1000τη to achieve convergence of desired statistical quantities (up to
fourth-order moments). Without loss of generality, τη = 1 was used for all runs. The
Fortran simulations are performed in serial and run on a desktop machine, taking a few
hours to complete.

4.2. Direct Numerical Simulation Database

The Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases (JHTDB) isotropic dataset (Li et al. 2008;
Perlman et al. 2007) provided the DNS statistics used for most of the comparisons in
this paper. The dataset contains the simulation results from a Re λ = 430 simulation
of Navier-Stokes with forcing at the two lowest wavenumbers. The pseudo-spectral
simulation provided a 10243 resolution on a (2π)3 cubic domain. Time advancement
was accomplished via the 2nd-order Adams-Bashforth scheme and de-aliasing was done
with 2√2/3 truncation and random phase shift. In a few cases, the comparisons are
supplemented with another DNS at Re λ = 160 using the same simulation code. Important
parameters for the simulations are given in Table 1. It is worth noting that RFD model
with τK
T = 0.1 has been equated with Re λ = 150 (Chevillard et al. 2008). Reaching
Re λ = 430 requires τK
T ≈ 0.035, which is outside the range for which RFD model
produces results with reasonable accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we use τK
T = 0.1
for the RFD simulations, the value at which the RFD model seems to perform the best.

5. Results

5.1. Longitudinal and Transverse Components

Figure 2 illustrates the output of the RDGF mapping closure by plotting sample
trajectories of longitudinal and transverse velocity components over an interval of 20τη.
Because of the stochastic forcing, the paths appear rough, even at the scale of the
Kolmogorov timescale. Nonetheless, such stochastic models can be useful when their
statistical behavior provides a good model for Lagrangian velocity gradient statistics in
isotropic turbulence.

The probability density functions for the longitudinal velocity derivative, A11, and
transverse velocity derivative, A12, are shown in ﬁgure 3. The RFD, EGF, and RDGF
closures are compared with DNS results at the two diﬀerent Reynolds numbers. The
negative skewness expected for A11 and the symmetry expected for A12 are reﬂected by all
three models. The RFD results appear much too close to Gaussian when compared with
DNS results. The longitudinal velocity gradient distributions (top row of ﬁgure) from the
EGF and RDGF models are better than that of RFD in terms of deviation from Gaussian
behavior. For the transverse component, the RFD and EGF results appear similar, being
between Gaussian and the DNS results. The RDGF mapping closure provides a much
better match for the A12 PDF. The trends suggest that the RDGF model may provide
an even better ﬁt for DNS data at slightly lower Re λ, but we refrain from any iterative
matching with any particular precise value of Re λ as we are mostly interested in overall
trends.

As a compact comparison, Table 2 records the skewness and ﬂatness factors of the
above PDFs. All three models signiﬁcantly under-predict the magnitude of the negative
skewness for A11, though the RFD and RDGF mapping closures are much closer than the
EGF closure. The ﬂatness factors for the longitudinal and transverse components help
quantify the tendency of the model to reproduce the fattened tails of the PDFs in ﬁgure
3. For the longitudinal component, the EGF model appears to give the closest match,

while RDGF is slightly closer for the transverse component. In each case, the ﬂatness
factors are too low, as was probably already evident in the above ﬁgures. It appears that
the trend in the RFD and RDGF mapping closures that the longitudinal component has
lower ﬂatness than the transverse component better reﬂects the DNS trend. Indeed, as
was discussed above, these results for RDGF could be seen as somewhat more appropriate
for matching the DNS results at even lower Reynolds number.

5.2. Isotropic Relations

Table 3 compares the extent to which each of the models is able to reproduce important
isotropy relations. Each ratio is equal to unity for isotropic turbulence. The ﬁrst ratio,
(cid:104)Sij Sij(cid:105)
(cid:104)Ωij Ωij(cid:105) , represents the ratio of strain-rate magnitude to vorticity magnitude produced
by the model and is equal to unity since by construction (adjustment of forcing param-
eters), (cid:104)Q(cid:105) = 0. The second ratio,
, represents the balance between strain
production and vorticity production and is equal to unity if (cid:104)R(cid:105) = 0, also expected

due to the adjustment of forcing parameters. The identities are all satisﬁed within
numerical error showing that the numerical tuning of the three parameters (Ds,Da,
and τ ) is very accurate. This represents a signiﬁcant advantage of the RDGF mapping
closure, seeing that the earlier RFD model slightly over-emphasizes strain-dominant and
strain-production-dominant regions while the EGF model signiﬁcantly over-emphasizes
rotation-dominant and rotation-production-dominant regions. All three models satisfy
the relation between dissipation and the longitudinal velocity derivative variance.

5.3. Enstrophy and Dissipation

The probability density distributions (PDFs) of enstrophy and dissipation in isotropic
turbulence (Meneveau & Sreenivasan 1991; Bershadskii et al. 1993; Donzis et al. 2008)
provide another useful test for comparing Lagrangian velocity gradient models. Figure
4 compares the dissipation (top) and enstrophy (bottom) PDFs of the RFD (left),
EGF (middle), and RDGF (right) models with the DNS results at two Re λ values.
The RFD model appears to produce exponential tails (straight lines on the log-linear
plot) rather than stretched exponential. The EGF model is much improved for the
dissipation and enstrophy PDF, appearing somewhat closer to the characteristic stretched
exponential shape. The RDGF model provides the best agreement with both dissipation
and enstrophy distributions, displaying the stretched-exponential shape for both. It
should be kept in mind that the EGF and RDGF do not have explicit Reynolds number
dependence. Again, as a qualitative observation, the RDGF model gives results that may
appear even more realistic for lower Re λ.

5.4. Vorticity and Strain-Rate

One of the well-known features of velocity gradient statistics in turbulent ﬂows is the
non-trivial alignment of the vorticity vector with respect to the three eigenvectors of the
strain-rate tensor (Ashurst et al. 1987). The vorticity tends to align more closely with
the strain-rate eigenvector associated with the intermediate eigenvalue. Meanwhile, the
vorticity tends to be more perpendicular with respect to the strain-rate eigenvector of the
smallest eigenvalue. The alignment distribution between the vorticity and the eigenvector
of the largest strain-rate eigenvalue tends to be fairly uniform in comparison.

Figure 5a-c shows the PDFs for the cosines of the angles between vorticity and
strain-rate eigenvectors. The DNS results at Re λ = 430 are used for comparison here;
these statistics show virtually no dependence on Re λ. All three models mimic the well-
known trend outlined above. The RFD model slightly underpredicts the anti-alignment
of vorticity with the smallest strain-rate eigenvalue, while displaying a slight preference
toward anti-alignment for the largest eigenvalue. The EGF consistently under-predicts
the alignment biases seen in the DNS results. It appears that the RDGF model obtains
the best agreement overall.

which compares the relative magnitudes of each of the three strain-rate eigenvalues taking
into account that they must add up to zero. Figure 5(d) reports the PDFs for the three
models considered here, shown in comparison to DNS results (Re λ = 430). It is well-
known that turbulent velocity gradients are biased toward s∗ > 0, i.e. more distortion
toward disk-like ﬂuid elements (Lund & Rogers 1994; Meneveau 2011). All three models
reﬂect this trend. The RFD model over-predicts the bias toward positive s∗, while the
EGF model under-predicts it. The RDGF model appears to produce results in closest
comparison with DNS.

Table 4 compares ensemble averages for some of these vorticity and strain-rate statis-
tics, helping quantify the above discussion. Additionally available from this table is the
ratio of average strain-rate eigenvalues, for which the RDGF models also provides good
predictions.

5.5. Dynamics in the Q-R Plane

Another salient feature of turbulent velocity gradient statistics is the teardrop shaped
contours of the joint-probability density function for the Q and R invariants. Figure 6
compares such joint PDFs from the three models with DNS results (Re λ = 430). Each
model reproduces to some extent the features in the DNS results, most notably the
teardrop shape.

The RFD results are too compact, lacking suﬃcient excursions far from the mean,
as also seen previously for the single component PDFs in ﬁgure 3. One also observes
a less prominent high-probability ﬁlament descending down the positive R branch of
the Viellefosse line. The EGF model results are more accurate in their depiction of the
high probability region along the Viellefosse line but a less realistic aspect of the EGF
results is the exaggerated higher-probability in the positive Q region compared to the
negative Q region. This feature is evidently responsible for the EGF model’s departure
from (cid:104)Q(cid:105) = 0 (the EGF also does not reproduce (cid:104)R(cid:105) = 0). The results from the RDGF
mapping closure share some of these strengths and weaknesses. For the RDGF, the low
probability contours remain too compact, though less so than in the case of the RFD
model. The shape of the high-probability regions closely mirrors those for the DNS.
Additionally, there is some promising spread for the low-probability contours into the
high positive Q regions. However, overall, the details of the low-probability contours (the
tails of the joint distribution) still represents a challenge for all three models.

Neglecting the stochastic forcing for the moment, the dynamical equations for Q and

These equations represent average velocities in the QR probability space which, when
multiplied with the local probability density, represent ﬂuxes in probability space. They
are evaluated based on DNS as well as from the three models. In order to compare
them under similar conditions, averages are evaluated as an a priori test, by evaluating
the model results from an ensemble of DNS trajectories. In practice, we found that the
most signiﬁcant eﬀect of this approach (as opposed to sample the statistics along model
evaluations) was to increase the domain in QR space where the average velocities could
be obtained.

the three models compared with DNS results (Re λ = 430). The primary action of the
RFD pressure Hessian is to oppose the restricted Euler motion along the Vieillefosse tail.
In fact, the magnitude of the pressure Hessian opposing the restricted Euler singularity
along the Vieillefosse tail is too strong in comparison with the DNS data. As previously
noted (Chevillard et al. 2008), the RFD pressure Hessian lacks the right-to-left motion
seen in the DNS and the other two models. This elucidates the shortcoming of the
upstream isotropic assumption for the pressure Hessian tensor. In fact, it is a signiﬁcant
contribution of the Gaussian form of the pressure Hessian that it adds this right-to-left
tendency due to the deviatoric component of the tensor.

The EGF pressure Hessian tends to oppose the singularity with smaller magnitude
than the DNS results indicate, while the RDGF opposes with slightly larger magnitude
than DNS. While the right-to-left motion is captured by the EGF and RDGF closures, a
few more subtle features of the DNS results are not. First, the relatively ambient region
of positive R near Q = 0 has an unphysically active right-to-left motion in the EGF
and RDGF closures. Secondly, the DNS results indicate opposition to restricted Euler
along the left side of the Vieillefosse line, which is not replicated by the EGF or RDGF
closures. Other subtle diﬀerences and similarities may be noted, but the above discussion
summarizes the most important trends noticeable.

of the models compared with DNS. All the models produce the same structure: the
viscous Laplacian damps the velocity gradient, thus trajectories are pushed toward the
origin in QR-space. Note that the DNS results show some slight deviation from pure
damping structure. For example, near Q = 0 for R > 0, there is an upward trend in the
streamlines instead of proceeding straight toward the origin. Each of the models fail to
capture this eﬀect. Thus, updating the upstream conditions of the conditional viscous
Hessian produces minimal changes in the behavior of the closure. It appears that the
upstream isotropic assumption of RFD model for the viscous term produces relatively
more accurate results than was the case for the pressure Hessian.

In terms of magnitude, the RFD model is too strong. The EGF model produces good
agreement with DNS in magnitude for the Q < 0, R > 0 region near the Vieillefosse tail,
while it is too weak in the Q > 0, R < 0 region. The RDG model has magnitudes in
good agreement with DNS for Q > 0, R < 0 but is too strong in the Q < 0, R > 0 along
the Viellefosse tail.

The above QR-space analysis shows advantages of the EGF and RDGF closures over
the RFD closure. Of particular importance is that the RFD pressure Hessian does
not have a strong tendency to decrease R. The structure of the deviatoric pressure
Hessian from the Gaussian ﬁelds provides this eﬀect. Furthermore, the RFD model’s

5.6. Correlation Coeﬃcients

It is interesting to compare the a priori success of each model in terms of correlation
coeﬃcients for the deviatoric part of the pressure Hessian and the viscous Laplacian. For
the deviatoric part of the pressure Hessian, the correlation coeﬃcient is deﬁned as,

(5.5)

A similar correlation coeﬃcient is also deﬁned for the viscous Laplacian. These are
computed using 8th-order ﬁnite diﬀerencing from an ensemble of 10 million points in
the DNS results.

Table 5 shows the resulting correlation coeﬃcients. Included also is the original Gaus-
sian Fields (GF) closure of Wilczek & Meneveau (2014), which did not provide a
statistically stationary solution but rather succumbs to the ﬁnite-time singularity similar
to the restricted Euler. Overall, the viscous Laplacian models are more successful than the
pressure Hessian models. The RFD model has the lowest a-priori correlation coeﬃcients
for both closures. The diﬀerence between the GF and EGF model in Table 5 is minimal.
The RDGF model actually shows slightly lower correlation for its pressure Hessian
model, indicating that the eﬀect of the recent deformation on the Gaussian structure
is perhaps not as helpful as one might have hoped. Perhaps the real advantage of the
recent deformation is that the magnitude is increased without abandoning the analytical
coeﬃcients (i.e. α = − 2
5 ). The eﬀect is that the singularity is avoided without
recourse to DNS-tuned coeﬃcients.

5.7. Computational Cost

It is useful to mention that these three models are not equal in terms of computational
cost. The above results were computed using a Fortran 90 code executed on a single
processor. A minimal code involving only time advancement of the velocity gradient
tensor without any statistical calculations was timed for the three models. It was found
that, per time step, the RFDF model requires about 1.5 times longer than the EGF
model, while the RDGF model takes about 2.5 times longer. It is worth noting, however,
that the RFD and RDGF models were found to run smoothly and accurately with a time
step of about dt = 0.04τη, while the EGF model required a time step of dt = 0.01τη to
avoid singularity. Even with such a small time step, the stochastic system exhibited rare
rogue trajectories that had an overwhelming eﬀect on the ﬂatness factors, preventing
convergence in a reasonable amount of time (e.g. trajectories advanced for 1000τη). We

Lagrangian velocity gradient closure

21

note that Wilczek & Meneveau (2014) used an even smaller time step of dt = 0.001τη.
Therefore, the computational cost advantage of EGF model is not realized. The RFD
model does have a computation cost per time step approximately 40% smaller than that
of the RDGF model.

6. Conclusions

In this paper, a new closure, the Recent Deformation of Gaussian Fields (RDGF)
mapping closure, for the pressure Hessian and viscous Laplacian along Lagrangian
trajectories in turbulent ﬂow is introduced. The new closure beneﬁts from the insights
of both the Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD) and Gaussian Field (GF) closures. The
GF closure calculations are applied for the initial upstream conditions of the conditional
pressure Hessian and viscous Laplacian, before performing a recent ﬂuid deformation
mapping to complete the closure. The coeﬃcients for Gaussian ﬁelds can be used and
three remaining free parameters related to forcing and time-scale are constrained so that
the model reproduces known exact statistical relations. The stochastic forcing for this
model is also generalized from that used for the previous models so that the magnitude
of the symmetric and anti-symmetric forcings can be applied independently.

A priori evaluation of the models in terms of correlation coeﬃcients and QR-space
velocities reveals the shortcomings of RFD closure: the magnitudes of the unclosed terms
are signiﬁcantly over-estimated, and the role of the pressure Hessian in decreasing the
R invariant is absent. These shortcomings are much improved using the conditional
pressure Hessian from Gaussian ﬁelds. On the other hand, the exponential non-linearity
of the recent deformation tensor allows for more eﬀective prevention of singularities. As a
result, the RDGF model does not require DNS-tuned coeﬃcients in order to prevent the
singularity. In this way, the RDGF model has the robustness and analytical closedness of
RFD model while providing a more realistic structure of the pressure Hessian from the
GF closure.

A comparison of various single-time statistics suggests that the RDGF model can pro-
vide excellent results in comparison to the two previous models. However, by comparison
with DNS at Re λ = 430, the quantitative results reveal remaining shortcomings such as
lack of increasing long tails and intermittency. The RDGF results seem more consistent
with lower Reynolds number DNS results. This highlights one of the major limitations
of the current model, that it does not include a robust way of changing the Reynolds
number whereas velocity gradient statistics are known to depend strongly on Reynolds
number. The RFD model does include a mechanism for increasing the Reynolds number,
but only in a very limited range. In fact, RFD applied for Re λ ≈ 430 is already outside the
range where it performs well. The RDGF mapping closure suﬀers these same drawbacks
as RFD, even if the skewness factor is adjusted to reﬂect its (weak) dependence on
Reynolds number.

In summary, this paper builds a new closure framework for the conditional pressure
Hessian and viscous Laplacian which leverages insights of previous approaches. It pro-
vides, therefore, a promising direction for future investigations of velocity gradient statis-
tics in isotropic turbulence. At suﬃciently high Reynolds numbers, where approximate
isotropy of small scales is a safe assumption, models for isotropic turbulence can be
applicable for a more general class of turbulent ﬂows, for which some applications may
ﬁnd eﬃcient access to velocity gradient statistics useful.

Appendix A. Isotropic Tensorial Stochastic Forcing for Symmetric

and Anti-Symmetric Components

In this appendix, the form of the stochastic forcing in (2.7) is established. As identiﬁed
in the text, the forcing should have the form dFij = bijk(cid:96)dWk(cid:96), and can be thought
of as a sum of symmetric and anti-symmetric forcing, dFij = dF (s)
ij , where
dF (s)
2 (dFij − dFji). Since dWij represents a tensorial
Wiener process, i.e. (cid:104)Wij(cid:105) = 0 and (cid:104)dWijdWk(cid:96)(cid:105) = δikδj(cid:96)dt, then
(cid:104)dFijdFk(cid:96)(cid:105) = bijmnbk(cid:96)mndt = Dijk(cid:96)dt.

Here, by deﬁnition, Ds and Da represent the growth rate of the variance of symmetric

Requiring also that the forcing be trace-free (incompresibility), then

Diik(cid:96) = (3d1 + d2 + d3) δk(cid:96) = 0.

Combining this constraint with the two deﬁnitions of Ds and Da given above,

To implement this forcing, however, the tensor bijk(cid:96) is necessary, thus the equation

bijmnbk(cid:96)mn = Dijk(cid:96) must be solved. Using the general isotropic form

bijk(cid:96) = b1δijδk(cid:96) + b2δikδj(cid:96) + b3δi(cid:96)δjk,

the tensor contractions yield the following system of equations,

Meanwhile, Wilczek & Meneveau (2014) tuned Ds = Da such that the deﬁnition of τη
was consistent between model and numerics. In the authors’ current view, e.g. considering
(2.8) and (2.9), there is no a-priori reason that the strain-rate and vorticity should be
forced stocastically with the same amplitude, therefore, the present model considers Ds
and Da to be two independent tuning parameters.

Appendix B. Analytical Calculation of γ for the Gaussian Fields

Representation of the Conditional Pressure Hessian

A key component to both the Enhanced Gaussian closure and the recent-deformation
of Gaussian ﬁelds mapping closure is the representation of a conditional pressure Hessian
using (2.20). While the coeﬃcients α and β were directly evaluated from the Gaussian
ﬁelds closure, the last coeﬃcient is determined by the details of the longitudinal corre-
lation function, (2.21). Calculations are easier using the longitudinal structure function

Note that since the Gaussian ﬁelds evaluation is back-in-time, so this can be interpreted
as the back-in-time enstrophy dissipation. By deﬁnition, the RFD-style mapping used to
generate the approximate back-in-time values keeps velocity gradients constant, but not
velocity Hessians. Therefore, the enstrophy production (cid:104)ωiSijωj(cid:105) is constant under the
mapping but the enstrophy dissipation is not constant. Two choices are thus available:
apply the enstrophy balance for the back-in-time enstrophy dissipation, or try to invert
the mapping eﬀect on the enstrophy dissipation to apply the balance at the present time.
It is the opinion of the authors that the second option is desirable, since it leads to the
application of the enstrophy balance at the present time rather than back-in-time.

Thus, by modeling choice, the relevant enstrophy balance is

(cid:104)ωiSijωj(cid:105) = ν

(D 7)

The result given by Wilczek & Meneveau (2014) is recovered when the mapping is
removed, Dij = δij, so that Ckk = 3. In this way, the δ coeﬃcient itself depends on the
recent deformation. This provides the convenience of an additional non-linearity in the
viscous term to prevent unwanted singularities while advancing the stochastic diﬀerential
equation.

As a ﬁnal note, the scaling of δ ∼ τ−1
contradicts the RFD model for the viscous
Laplacian, which used the integral timescale and thus introduced a Re−1
λ scaling for the
viscous term. While Re λ dependence can be introduced in the present model through
the skewness coeﬃcient, the similar diﬃculties as encountered by the RFD model are
seen when going to large Reynolds numbers. It is the authors’ view that a ﬁxed skewness
coeﬃcient, S = −0.6, is appropriate for the present model’s the level of ﬁdelity.
