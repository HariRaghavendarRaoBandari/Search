Non perturbative studies of Schwinger-Dyson equations (SDEs) require their inﬁnite, coupled
tower to be truncated in order to reduce them to a practically solvable set. In this connection, a
physically acceptable ansatz for the three point vertex is the most favorite choice. Scalar quantum
electrodynamics (sQED) provides a simple and neat platform to address this problem. The most gen-
eral form of the three point scalar-photon vertex can be expressed in terms of only two independent
form factors, a longitudinal and a transverse one. Ball and Chiu have demonstrated that the lon-
gitudinal vertex is ﬁxed by requiring the Ward-Fradkin-Green-Takahashi identity (WFGTI), while
the transverse vertex remains undetermined. In massless quenched sQED, we construct the trans-
verse part of the non perturbative scalar-photon vertex. This construction (i) ensures multiplicative
renormalizability (MR) of the scalar propagator in keeping with the Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin
transformations (LKFTs), (ii) has the same transformation properties as the bare vertex under
charge conjugation, parity and time reversal, (iii) has no kinematic singularities and (iv) reproduces
one loop asymptotic result in the weak coupling regime of the theory.

INTRODUCTION

Gauge theories of fundamental interactions have been
the cornerstone of describing the physical world at the
most basic level. Their enormous success primarily lies
in the region where the coupling strength is small enough
and the tools of perturbation theory are reliable. How-
ever, not all interesting phenomena can be accessed in
this approximation scheme.
In the non perturbative
sector of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), two major
phenomena emerge: 1) color conﬁnement, and 2) dy-
namical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB). For studying
strongly interacting bound states, a reliable understand-
ing of these phenomena is essential. However, it can be
achieved solely through non perturbative techniques such
as lattice QCD, SDEs, [1, 2], chiral perturbation theory
and eﬀective quark models. Keeping this in mind, our
interest is focussed on the study of the physically accept-
able truncations of SDEs beyond perturbation theory.

SDEs are the fundamental equations of motion of any
quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT). They form an inﬁnite set of
coupled integral equations that relate the n-point Green
function to the (n + 1)-point function. As the simplest
example, propagators are related to the three point ver-
tices, the latter to the four point functions and so on, ad
inﬁnitum. As their derivation requires no assumption re-
garding the strength of the interaction, they are ideally
suited for studying interactions like QCD, where one sin-
gle theory has diametrically opposed perturbative and
non perturbative facets in the ultraviolet and infrared
regimes of momenta, respectively. Unfortunately, being
an inﬁnite set of coupled equations, they are intractable

without some simplifying assumptions. Typically, in the
non perturbative region, SDEs are truncated at the level
of two-point Green functions (propagators). We must
then use an ansatz for the full three point vertex. This
has to be done carefully. Otherwise, solutions can be in
conﬂict with some of the key features of a QFT, such as
gauge invariance of physical observables and renormaliz-
ability of the divergent functions involved, thus jeopar-
dizing the credibility of the truncation scheme employed.
In contrast with the complicated non abelian scenario
of QCD, quantum electrodynamics (QED) has proved to
be a good starting point in studying the non pertutbative
regime of the SDEs. Better yet, in the absence of Dirac
matrices, sQED can oﬀer an even more attractive model
to construct acceptable non perturbative ans¨atze for the
vertices involved. In this article, we set out to construct
a scalar-photon three point vertex which must comply
with the following key criteria:

• It must

satisfy the Ward-Fradkin-Green-

Takahashi identity (WFGTI), [3–5].

Just like in spinor QED and QCD, Ball and Chiu, [6],
provide the non perturbative form of the longitudinal
three point vertex in sQED, which explicitly satisﬁes the
WFGTI, [3–5]. We take it as our starting point.

• It must satisfy the local gauge covariance prop-

erties of the theory.

Note that although the WFGTI is a consequence of
gauge invariance,
it is insuﬃcient to ensure the local
gauge covariance relation of the scalar propagator. In or-
der to ensure the latter, we demand the transverse part of

2
• It should reduce to its perturbation theory Feyn-

man expansion in the limit of weak coupling.

A truncation of the complete set of SDEs, that main-
tains gauge invariance and MR of a gauge theory at every
level of approximation, is perturbation theory. Physically
meaningful solutions of the SDEs must agree with per-
turbative results in the weak coupling regime. We use
one loop perturbative calculations as a guiding princi-
ple for the three point vertex, [39–41]. In our construc-
tion in terms of the function W mentioned above, we
explore how perturbation theory provides an additional
constraint. Using a one loop calculation of the scalar-
photon three point vertex presented in Refs. [41, 42], we
derive a perturbative constraint on W (x) to O(α), in
the leading logarithms approximation (LLA). We ensure
that our non perturbative construction of the said vertex
satisﬁes this constraint.

• It must have the same symmetry properties as
the bare vertex under charge conjugation, parity
and time reversal.

• One loop perturbation theory suggests that it
should be free of any kinematic singularities.
Following Ball and Chiu, [6], we shall enforce this
requirement.

The scalar-photon three point vertex Γµ(k, p) must
be symmetric under the exchange of momenta k and p.
Moreover, we do not expect it to have kinematic singu-
larities as k2 ⇒ p2. We build these features into our
construction.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section II we in-
troduce the SDE for the massless scalar propagator in
quenched sQED. We deﬁne the longitudinal and trans-
verse parts of the scalar-photon vertex and simplify the
SDE by performing angular integration. In Section III,
we study the LKFT for the scalar propagator to obtain a
non perturbative expression for the wavefunction renor-
malization which deﬁnes this propagator. We introduce
and explain the concept of MR in Section IV. We deduce
a power law solution for the wavefunction renormaliza-
tion of the scalar propagator and compare it with the
ﬁndings of the LKFT in Section III. Section V contains
details of how we impose constraints of the LKFT and
MR on the three point transverse scalar-photon vertex
in terms of the function W (x).
In Section VI, we add
additional constraints of one loop perturbation theory,
symmetry properties and the lack of kinematic singulari-
ties. We also construct an explicit example of a non per-
turbative massless three point scalar-photon vertex. We
present our conclusions and discussion in Section VII.

the vertex to be constrained by the LKFTs, [7–10]. The
LKFTs are a well deﬁned set of transformations which
describe the response of the Green functions to an arbi-
trary gauge transformation. These transformations leave
the SDEs and the WFGTI form-invariant and ensure chi-
ral quark condensate is gauge invariant in spinor QED
and QCD, a feature not guaranteed through satisfying
WFGTI alone. Therefore, LKFTs potentially play an
important role in guiding us toward an improved ansatz
for the three point vertex and imposing gauge invariant
chiral symmetry breaking, see for example Refs. [11–19].
More recently, these transformations have also been stud-
ied in the world line formalism, where we generalize LK-
FTs to arbitrary amplitudes in sQED, [20].

The truncation scheme in preserving gauge invariance
of observables has also been studied in simpler gauge
theories such as QED3, e.g., [13, 21–25]. These works
involve introducing constraints of gauge invariance in
the truncations.
In Ref. [24], it was shown that if one
naively employed even the most sophisticated full Curtis-
Pennington (CP) or Ball-Chiu (BC) vertices in diﬀerent
covariant gauges, they are not suﬃcient to ensure gauge
invariant results for physical observables and the ex-
pected gauge covariance properties of the fermion prop-
agator. However, in later articles [16, 26], the need to
incorporate the LKFT correctly was emphasized in or-
der to obtain gauge invariance of corresponding physical
observables, such as the chiral quark condensate and the
conﬁnement-deconﬁnement phase transition as a func-
tion of the number of fermion ﬂavors (nf ).

• It must ensure the multiplicative renormaliz-

ability (MR) of the two point propagator.

Studies in massless scalar and spinor QED as well as in
QCD, demonstrate that the LKFT of the wavefunction
renormalization implies an MR form of a power law, [13–
15, 19, 27]. We would like to reiterate that this solution
can be reproduced only with an appropriate choice of the
electron-photon three point vertex, as demonstrated ﬁrst
in Ref. [28]. There have been a series of works, spanned
over a couple of decades, which construct the electron-
photon vertex, implementing the LKFT and MR of the
electron propagator, [28–38]. In Ref. [38], MR was im-
plemented for the fermion propagator and it simultane-
ously ensures the gauge invariance of the critical cou-
pling, above which chiral symmetry is dynamically bro-
ken.

In this article, we impose the conditions of MR on the
three point scalar-photon vertex in sQED. It involves an
unknown function W (x) of a dimensionless ratio x of mo-
menta, satisfying an integral constraint which guarantees
the MR of the scalar propagator. In this construction, we
assume that the transverse vertex has no dependence on
the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta
of the scalar particle, an approximation which can be
readily undone through deﬁning an eﬀective transverse
vertex.

The detailed derivation of the SDEs for relevant Green
functions for this sQED Lagrangian already exists in lit-
erature, [43]. The SDE for the scalar propagator S(k),
in the quenched approximation, is shown in Fig. 1:

FIG. 1: The SDE for the scalar propagator. The color-ﬁlled
solid blobs labelled with S and Γν stand for the full scalar
propagator and the full scalar-photon vertex, respectively.
The dots (··· ) represent all the diagrams whose contribution

propagator. For massless scalars, S(k) can be expressed
in terms of the so-called wavefunction renormalization

are the bare four point scalar-scalar-photon-photon and
the four-scalar vertices, respectively. The last two dia-
grams of the gap equation, Eq. (2), will be referred to as
the photon and the scalar bubble diagrams, in that order.
Γν(ω, k) is the full three point scalar-photon vertex, for
which we must make an ansatz in order to solve Eq. (2).
The WFGTI for this vertex, i.e.,

qµΓµ(ω, k) = S−1(ω) − S−1(k) ,

(5)

allows us to decompose it as a sum of
longitudinal
and transverse components, as suggested by Ball and
Chiu, [6]:

Γµ(ω, k) = Γµ

L(ω, k) + Γµ

T (ω, k) .

(6)

The longitudinal part Γµ

which remains completely undetermined,

T (ω, k),
is naturally

Moreover,

qµΓµ

T (ω, k) = 0 .

Γµ

T (k, k) = 0 .

(8)

In order to satisfy the WFGTI in a manner free of kine-
matic singularities, we follow Ball and Chiu and write

Γµ

L(ω, k) =

S−1(ω) − S−1(k)

ω2 − k2

(ω + k)µ .

(9)

This construction implies that the ultraviolet divergences
solely reside in the longitudinal part. Moreover, recall the
following relations between the renormalized and bare
quantities:

SR(p) = Z−1

2 S(p) , Γµ

R(k, p) = Z1Γµ(k, p) .

(10)

Thus, the form of the longitudinal vertex in Eq. (9) guar-
antees the relation Z1 = Z2. Consequently, the running
of the coupling is dictated by the corrections to the pho-
ton propagator alone. In the approximation of quenched
sQED, the coupling does not run.
If we unquench the
theory, it is easy to calculate Z3 and the running cou-
pling constant with the well known expression:

1 − (α(Q2

The ultraviolet ﬁnite transverse vertex can be expanded
out in terms of one unknown function τ (ω2, k2, q2), [6]:

where Λ is the ultraviolet cut-oﬀ used to regularize the
divergent integrals involved. The bare scalar propagator
is given by S0(k) = 1/k2. The bare photon propagator is

(12)

where

=_kkkk−1−1ww − kGnSSww__kkS__kkS+...is the transverse basis vector in the Minkowski space
and fulﬁls Eqs. (7,8). To begin with, the form factor
τ (ω2, k2, q2) is an unconstrained scalar function (repre-
senting an 8-fold simpliﬁcation of the spinor QED/QCD
case).

Following the non perturbative vertex construc-
[6, 41], our analysis ensures
tion/truncation of Refs.
that gauge invariance (in terms of the WFGTI) for the
scalar propagator and the scalar-photon vertex is sat-
isﬁed. Within our truncation, another source of gauge
non-invariance in the scalar propagator could be the lack
of implementation of LKFT, a feature of the bare as
well as BC vertices. We make sure that our ansatz for
the transverse part satisﬁes this constraint non pertur-
batively. Photon propagator also has its Ward identity
but we work throughout in the quenched approximation.
Therefore, within the conﬁnes of our assumptions, it re-
ceives no corrections and hence the four point diagrams
we have discarded do not aﬀect the correct gauge invari-
ance properties of the scalar propagator. They will be
essential, for example, in ensuring the transversality of
the photon propagator in unquenched sQED, not investi-
gated in the present work. Furthermore, there are also re-
strictions of the gauge transformations on how the three
point vertex is related to the four point vertex, constrain-
ing the form of the latter. In Ref.
[42], two of the present
authors exploited these constraints to carry out its non
perturbative construction consistent with WFGTI which
relates three point vertices to the four point ones. There
is an undetermined part which is transverse to one or
both the external photons, and needs to be evaluated
through perturbation theory. They present in detail how
the transverse part at the one loop order can be evaluated
for completely general kinematics of momenta involved in
covariant gauges and dimensions. In this article, our fo-
cus is on constraining the non perturbative three point
scalar-photon vertex, capturing its key features, in par-
ticular its gauge covariance properties, its perturbative
expansion in the LLA as well as the MR of the scalar
propagator.

We make use of Eqs. (5, 6,9, 12,13) in the gap equation,
i.e., Eq. (2), and then Wick rotate it to the Euclidean
space to write:

(14)

where ∆2 = (ω · k)2 − ω2k2, α = e2/4π is the bare cou-
pling constant, and the subscript E indicates integration
over the whole Euclidean space. Note that we have ne-
glected the photon and the scalar bubble diagrams as
well as the diagrams whose contribution begins at the
two loops level, since they do not contribute to leading
logs in the one loop calculation, as we shall discuss later.

4

At this stage, it appears impossible to proceed any fur-
ther because of the dependence of τ on the angle between
the incoming and outgoing momenta ω and k of the scalar
particle. We shall assume that the transverse vertex has
no dependence on this angle, i.e., it is independent of q2.
Consequently, this vertex is only an eﬀective one which
will allow us to capture many key features of the theory
in a simple manner. This assumption allows us to carry
out the angular integration in Eq. (14).
In this sense,
we are calculating an eﬀective transverse vertex. Note
that it is easy to undo this independent angle approxi-
mation exactly. This has been explained and employed
in Refs. [33, 44] for the case of spinor QED. Based upon
the results found in these articles and our cross-check
for sQED, we conclude that the qualitative implications
of the ansatz of the three point scalar-photon vertex are
insigniﬁcant, and hence we do not report corresponding
ﬁndings.

At this point, it is obvious that we require the knowl-
edge of the form factor τ (ω2, k2) to ﬁnd the wavefunc-
tion renormalization F (k2, Λ2). However, this problem
can be inverted. The requirements of LKFT and the MR
of F (k2, Λ2) can tightly constrain the function τ (ω2, k2).
We would like to stress that these constraints will be valid
only within our truncation scheme which consists of the
set of assumptions and hypotheses we have detailed be-
fore. We study them in the next section.

quadratic and logarithmic ultraviolet divergences. Our

Comparing Eqs. (32,41), we deduce that ξ0 = 3 is the
correct choice for sQED till one loop order in perturba-

Landau gauge ξ = 0 works well for the same order of
approximation.
Comparing expression (41) with the perturbative ex-
pansion (34) to one-loop order, we see that A1 = (ξ −
3)/4π. Therefore, perturbation theory suggests that the
anomalous dimension in (38) is

tion in Eq. (47) encodes the fact that we have taken
Λ2 ⇒ ∞. This can be done with impunity as the all
order logarithmic divergence has already been separated
out to construct the MR solution for the wavefunction
renormalization F . Moreover, we have introduced the
deﬁnition

h(x) ≡ xk2F (k2, Λ2)τ (xk2, k2) ,

(49)

which is a dimensionless function satisfying the property

h(x−1) = xβ−1h(x) ,

(50)
with β = (ξ − 3)/4π, as prescribed by Eq. (42). Em-
ploying Eq. (48) and the property in Eq. (50), we can

VI. PERTURBATION THEORY

CONSTRAINTS

In order to compare the vertex ansatz, Eq. (54), based
upon multiplicative renormalizability, against its one
loop perturbative form, Eq. (55), it is convenient to take
the asymptotic limit k2 (cid:29) p2 of external momenta in the
latter vertex. The resulting τBCD in the LLA is

Expectedly, it is independent of q2 and hence we drop this
dependence from its argument. Note that this expression
is also independent of the covariant gauge parameter ξ.
It is unlike spinor QED where the leading asymptotic
vertex is proportional to ξ. For a numerical check, we
deﬁne

˜τ (x) = − k2 τ (k2, xk2)

α ln x

,

(58)

where x = p2/k2 and we have suppressed the q2 depen-
dence for notational simpliﬁcation. Thus:

BCD (x) = − 3
˜τ asym
4π

.

(59)

In Fig. (2), we plot ˜τ asym
BCD (x) and ˜τBCD(x) as a function of
x, the latter for diﬀerent values of the gauge parameter
ξ and for a ﬁxed value of q2, chosen arbitrarily. In the
asymptotic limit, all curves converge to a single value, as
expected.

FIG. 2: The analytical result, long dashed lines representing
a constant value given in Eq. (59) for the asymptotic trans-
verse form factor ˜τ asym
BCD (x), agrees with the numerical plot of
˜τBCD(x) obtained from Eq. (55) in the limit x → 0 for diﬀer-
ent gauges and an arbitrarily chosen value of q2 = −0.7GeV 2.

Using the perturbative expression, Eq. (41), for F (k2)
in Eq. (54), and taking the asymptotic limit k2 (cid:29) p2, we
have

τ asym(k2, p2)

and (60) are already the same. Note that the second
term in the right hand side of Eq. (61) is a convenient
term to ensure MR of the scalar propagator. It drops out
in the LLA. Using the variable x = k2/p2 in Eq. (61), we
have

W (x) = λ x ln x +

so that the restriction in Eq. (47) is trivially satisﬁed.

we can ﬁnally deﬁne the transverse form factor as:

Note that the Eqs. (6,9,12,63) deﬁne our full vertex

• It satisﬁes the WFGTI by construction, [3–5].
• It guarantees the LKFT property of the scalar
propagator and can be checked by employing it in
its SDE. In other words, it ensures the multiplica-
tive renormalizability (MR) of the two point scalar
propagator.

• It reduces to its one loop perturbation theory Feyn-
man expansion in the limit of small coupling and
asymptotic values of momenta k2 (cid:29) p2.

• It has the same symmetry properties as the bare
vertex under charge conjugation, parity and time
reversal, which imply symmetry under k ↔ p.

• It is free of any kinematic singularities when k2 ⇒

the transverse form fac-
in the LLA. Note that
tors, Eqs. (57) and (60) have the functional
form
(1/k2) ln(k2/p2). Furthermore, they are the same in the
Feynman gauge (ξ = 1).
In order for them to be the
same in an arbitrary gauge ξ, we must seek a non-trivial
W -function in Eq. (52), still satisfying the restriction in
Eq (47), so that the corresponding perturbative vertex is
consistent with Eq. (57) in the asymptotic limit k2 (cid:29) p2.
Perhaps the simplest such choice for W is

W = 0, i.e., there is no necessity of a non-trivial W -
function since both perturbative vertices, Eqs.
(57)

An important thing to note is that in the ansatz for W
given in Eq. (62), MR condition is satisﬁed independently
of the value of the parameter λ. Moreover, λ is tied to
the anomalous dimensions β. To the ﬁrst order in α, we
have

tributing at the NLL and hence are required to determine

TABLE I: We compare diﬀerent vertex ans¨atze: Bare, BC and our proposal, the last being the only vertex satisfying the

function renormalization in Eq. (38).

the values of the coeﬃcients ci, i ≥ 2. However, the NLL
and constraints from subsequent orders can be absorbed
in our ansatz for the eﬀective vector vertex. Practically,
this is achieved by a new deﬁnition for λ without aﬀect-
ing the MR condition. Therefore, the procedure outlined
above can easily accommodate the NLL, NNLL and so
on. We only require ci for i = 2, 3,··· , which are pro-
vided by increasing orders of perturbation theory, see for
example [48].

Note that the kinematic dependence of the vertex on
q2 plays no role asymptotically and the standard anal-
ysis proceeds without reference to it. On the infrared
domain, however, the kinematic dependence on q2 may
be important. Our vertex has this pitfall but its simplic-
ity is reason enough for us to ignore this dependence.

Finally, in Table I, we compare diﬀerent vertex ans¨atze
as regards the correct behavior of the scalar propagator
under LKFT and MR. Neither the bare vertex nor the
BC vertex yield an MR solution. Our proposal is the
only one satisfying this constraint with the exponent of
the wavefunction renormalization in agreement with the
all order LLA in perturbation theory.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In the massless quenched sQED, we have derived a
practical and easy to implement constraint of multiplica-
tive renormalizability on the three point scalar-photon
vertex.
It leads to a family of these vertices in terms
of a constrained dimensionless function W (x). It has a
remarkably simple non perturbative integral restriction:

(cid:90) 1

dx W (x) = 0 ,

0

which guarantees the multiplicative renormalizability of
the scalar propagator to all orders in perturbation theory.

We further pin down W through the constraints of one
loop perturbation theory in the asymptotic limit, lack
of kinematic singularities and the imposition of discrete
symmetries. Finally, we construct a simple example en-
suring all these key features of the sQED. Though it is an
example from one of the simplest QFTs, it provides a sys-
tematic procedure for constructing a three point function
in terms of the corresponding two point function. This
method is general and can be implemented in a similar
manner to unquenched sQED as well as any other QFT
of interest. In this connection, we would like to comment
that an extension to the case of unquenched sQED is al-
gebraically rather involved. For example for spinor QED,
its unquenched version has been investigated in [36]. It
involves the constraints of MR both on the fermion and
photon propagators for massless fermions. However, the
fact remains that in the limit of nf → 0, one recuperates
the quenched QED results.

Another obvious and straightforward extension of
this work is to apply the same formalism to QCD and
constrain the quark-gluon vertex through the require-
ments of MR. It will supplement the earlier works to
improve our understanding of this three point function
on lattice, [49–51], as well as through continuum meth-
ods, [52–54]. We naturally expect the quark-gluon vertex
to invoke more W-functions because the transverse part
of this three point vertex is a lot richer than the one
in sQED with eight independent transverse vectors
as compared to only one for the latter. This work is
currently in progress.
