(Dated: March 11, 2016)

The analysis of the core recoil momentum distribution of neutron-rich isotopes of light exotic nuclei
is performed within a model of the halo nuclei described by a core and two neutrons dominated
by the s−wave channel. We adopt the renormalized three-body model with a zero-range force,
that accounts for the universal Eﬁmov physics. This model is applicable to nuclei with large two-
neutron halos compared to the core size, and a neutron-core scattering length larger than the
interaction range. The halo wave function in momentum space is obtained by using as inputs the
two-neutron separation energy and the energies of the singlet neutron-neutron and neutron-core
virtual states. Within our model, we obtain the momentum probability densities for the Borromean
exotic nuclei Lithium-11 (11Li), Berylium-14 (14Be) and Carbon-22 (22C). A fair reproduction of
the experimental data was obtained in the case of the core recoil momentum distribution of 11Li
and 14Be, without free parameters. By extending the model to 22C, the combined analysis of the
core momentum distribution and matter radius suggest (i) a 21C virtual state well below 1 MeV;
(ii) an overestimation of the extracted matter 22C radius; and (iii) a two-neutron separation energy
between 100 and 400 keV.

INTRODUCTION

The large reaction cross section of Carbon-22 (22C) observed by Tanaka and collaborators [1], in the collision of
22C on a liquid hydrogen target at 40A MeV compared to the neighbour carbon nuclides, 19C and 20C, triggered
a theoretical discussion [2–6] about the possible constraint that the associated extracted matter root-mean-square
m(cid:105) can have on the two-neutron separation energy, S2n. From the experimental point of view the
two-neutron separation energy of 22C is not well known. A recent atomic mass evaluation (Ame2012), reported in
Ref. [7], gives S2n = 110 (60) keV for 22C. And, from a mass measurement [8], S2n = -0.14 (46) keV. There is also an
indirect evidence that 22C could be bound by less than 70 keV [9].

Such reaction cross-section, analysed with a ﬁnite-range Glauber calculation under an optical-limit approximation,
m(cid:105) = 5.4 ± 0.9 fm [1]. Their analysis showed that the two-valence neutrons prefer to occupy
the s1/2 orbital. Considering the observed 22C matter radius together with the 20C one, it was given in Ref. [2] the
following estimate for the radius of the neutron halo orbit:

(cid:112)(cid:104)r2

n(cid:105) =

(1)

m[20C](cid:105) = 2.98(5) fm[10]. The 22C rms matter radius is used as a constrain to the poorly known ex-
perimental value of the two-neutron separation, in a renormalized zero-range three-body model [2], in a shell model
approach [3], in a three-body cluster model [4], and within an eﬀective ﬁeld theory with contact interactions [5].
All these approaches agree to a value around or below 100 keV. However, independent information are relevant to
cross check such estimations. Indeed, in Ref. [4], a strong correlation between the soft dipole mode in the Coulomb
fragmentation process of 22C and S2n was also shown.

Comparison between the experimental data for the core recoil momentum distributions of 22C [11] and Lithium-11
(11Li) [12] indicates similar sizes for their two-neutron halos, which suggest that the matter radius of the carbon
isotope could be overestimated (see Ref. [13], for further discussion). This motivates us to study the properties of
low-momentum distributions in two-neutron halo light exotic nucleus, which are dominated by s−wave short-range
two-body interactions in the neutron-neutron (n − n) and neutron-core (n − c) subsystems.
In the present work, the halo properties are analysed by using correlation between observables or scaling functions,
involving the width of the core recoil distribution, S2n, the energies of the s−wave virtual states of the singlet spin
n − n system and 21C. Furthermore, correlations between the matter radius and the quantities mentioned before are

2

also used in our combined analysis of the existing data for the width, matter radius and the virtual state of 21C. Our
interest is to constraint the parameters associated with the halo structure and two-neutron separation energy based
on these data ﬁtted to three-body model calculations, by adding to the work presented in Ref. [14] another universal
correlations of the width of the core momentum distribution and 22C matter radius.
The model calculations for the core recoil momentum distribution are performed within a zero-range three-body
model applied to a neutron-neutron-core (n−n−c) system, that fully accounts for the so-called Eﬁmov physics [15–17].
The detailed formulation of the momentum distributions was given in [18] and the inputs of the renormalized zero-
range model are the scattering lengths, and one three-body scale, which is given by the two-neutron separation energy.
Therefore, three low-energy observables are enough to determine another low-energy quantity through an appropriate
universal scaling function computed within the zero-range model. Following that, we established the above mentioned
correlations between two s−wave halo observable, like, e.g., the width of the momentum distribution with S2n, matter
radius with S2n, and the width and matter radius. In particular, this last one was useful to constrain the virtual state
energy of 21C, as will be discussed in detail.

In our work, the data for the core recoil momentum distribution extracted from the halo fragmentation reaction,
is interpreted on the basis of the Serber model [19], where the peak around zero momentum is proportional to the
momentum distribution. We test the reliability of our analysis with 11Li (see e.g. [12]) and 14Be, as the low energy
parameters used as input to our calculations are reasonably known. The recent experimental results for 20C and 22C
[11] allow us, in principle, to constraint S2n and the matter radius of 22C. In addition, we consider the constrain to
the virtual state of 21C by also computing the matter radius, which has a given value in Ref. [1]. An issue that is
beyond the present work, is the consideration of the range corrections to the scaling functions, either by calculations
with ﬁnite range potentials or along the lines suggested in Ref. [20], as well as in a series of recent works [21–24],
which we leave for a future investigation.
The paper is organized as follow. In section 2, the experimental 22C core recoil momentum distribution is revised
and the width associated with the two-neutron halo is singled out. In section 3, the scaling relations for the n− n− c
system close to the unitary limit is presented. In section 4, the scaling analysis for the 22C halo is performed in light
of the experimental result for the momentum width. Finally, in section 5, we have our summary.

II. CORE RECOIL MOMENTUM DISTRIBUTION IN 22C: PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

√

The information on the core recoil momentum distribution in two-neutron halo nuclei is assessed through the removal
cross-section from the collision of these radioactive exotic nuclei with nuclear targets at few hundred MeV/nucleon
(see e.g. [25]). For neutrons ﬂying out from s−states, these removal cross-sections shows a characteristic narrow peak
at zero core recoil momentum, and a width that features the weak binding of the neutrons to the core. In the example
of 11Li [12], it is visible the contribution of distributions with a narrow and wide widths. The narrow momentum
distribution is associated with the two neutrons in the halo state, and the wide one to the neutrons in the inner orbits
in 11Li and inside the 9Li core. Adopting such interpretation, the ﬁnal core momentum distribution is an incoherent
sum of two distributions one narrow and another wide. Of course this picture is based on a large separation between
the halo neutron orbit and the inner ones, implying in a small overlap among them, and suppression of the coherent
terms in the removal cross-section. By scaling arguments, the width of the narrow peak in 11Li should be of the order
of
mn S2n = 18 MeV/c, where mn is the nucleon mass. This is quite close to the experimental ﬁt, 21(3)MeV/c,
given in Ref. [12]. For such estimate we use the two-neutron separation energy of S2n = 369.15(65) keV [26].

The above description applied to 22C as formed by two neutrons in a weakly-bound halo with a core of 20C,
one expect that the core recoil momentum distribution presents itself as a narrow peak on the top of a wide one,
once the halo neutrons occupy an s state. The narrow and wide peaks should be associated with well separated
length or momentum scales, in order to characterize a true two-neutron halo state. We can resort to the recent
experimental information on two neutron removal cross-section [11] of 22C and 20C colliding with a carbon target at
240 MeV/A. The experimental resolution for both cases are very close. This allows to make the comparison between
the experimental removal cross-sections as a function of the core momentum as shown in the left panel of Fig. 1.
Apart small kinematical corrections, it is quite clear that the wide distribution corresponds to neutrons removed from
the core of 22C, and the narrow peak is clearly characterized.

To express such separation among the length/momentum scales of the halo state and the inner core orbits in 22C,
we introduce a phenomenological quantity, which gives the diﬀerence the two-neutron removal cross-sections in 22C
and 20C

The result for the FWHM is w = 79 ± 22 MeV/c, with the associated sav = 34 ± 9 MeV/c. Taking into account
the experimental resolution of sexp = 27 MeV/c [11], we obtain sav = 20 ± 15 MeV/c. The ﬁtting of the diﬀerence
without the average is given by

∆−1(p2) =(cid:8)(0.87 ± 0.14) + (5.60 ± 0.44) 10−4 ¯p2(cid:9) [mb/(MeV/c)]

(5)
such that for the FWHM we have w = 104 ± 39 MeV/c, with the corresponding s = 44 ± 16 MeV/c. After considering
the experimental resolution this value is reduced to s = 34 ± 21 MeV/c. The FWHM quoted in [11] for the narrow
peak of 22C is 73 MeV/c, with s = 31 MeV/c, compatible with our phenomenological analysis.
Naively, one could estimate that the narrow peak leads to S2n ∼ s2/mn. In this case, for s = (20, 34, 31) MeV/c
the corresponding values of S2n are given by (0.4, 1.2, 1) MeV. These values appear to be somewhat large according
to the analysis performed in [2–5], where the suggested upper limit for S2n is ∼ 0.1 MeV, to achieve consistency with
the extracted rms matter radius of 5.4 ± 9 fm [1]. In order to reﬁne our estimate of S2n, we will rely on three-body
calculations in the zero-range limit, where the universal scaling laws are deﬁned and computed, and in addition the
errors from our ﬁtting procedure have to be considered.

III. THE NEUTRON-NEUTRON-CORE SYSTEM CLOSE TO THE UNITARY LIMIT

Our goal here is to present an analysis of the core recoil momentum distributions of light two-neutron halo-nuclei
based on scaling laws computed for large scattering lengths, close to the unitary limit and dominated by the universal

Eﬁmov physics [15–17]. We adopt a renormalized three-body zero-range model, with the halo nucleus described as
two neutrons with an inert core (n− n− c), which is appropriate for the analysis of such weakly-bound systems, where
the n − n and the n − c interactions are dominated by s−wave states (see e.g.
[27–29]). Examples of two-neutron
halo nuclei, which ﬁts on these assumptions, are 11Li, 14Be and the carbon systems 20C and 22C. We study the width
of the core recoil momentum distribution and make use of the existing data for 11Li [12] and 14Be [30] to validate the
model, and then analyse the case of 22C [11]. The momentum distribution is extracted from the halo fragmentation
on nuclear targets (see e.g. Ref. [25]). The present analysis detail our recent study [14] and emphasizes the 22C case.

The core recoil momentum distribution in the n − n − c system is given by:

(cid:90)

n(qc) =

d3pc|(cid:104)(cid:126)qc(cid:126)pc|Ψ(cid:105)|2,

(6)

where the relative momentum of the core to the n − n subsystem is (cid:126)qc and the relative momentum between the
neutrons is (cid:126)pc, which is integrated above. Detailed expressions are given in [18], within the renormalized three-body
zero-range model. It requires as inputs the scattering lengths for the n− c and n− n systems, besides one three-body
(n−n−c ) scale, which will be chosen as S2n. In the unitary limit, besides the core mass A, the only scale that remains
is the three-body binging energy. The geometrically separated tower of Eﬁmov states is completely determined by
such energy, as a necessary requirement from the relation between the Eﬁmov eﬀect and the Thomas collapse [31].
In what follows, instead of the scattering lengths, we are going to refer to the corresponding two-body virtual state
energies (as the present study is limited to Borromean n− n− c systems), which are taken by their absolute (positive)
quantites Enc and Enn. The n − n virtual state energy in s−wave is known and in general will be ﬁxed to 143 keV.
The momentum space s-wave three-body wave function (|Ψ(cid:105)), for the renormalized zero-range three-body model
applied to the two-neutron halo nuclei, can be written in terms of two spectator functions, χnn(qc) and χnc(|(cid:126)pc ± (cid:126)qc
2 |)
[28], where the bound-state three-body energy is replaced by the two-neutron separation energy S2n, such that

(cid:104)(cid:126)qc(cid:126)pc|Ψ(cid:105) =

where mnn and mnnc are the reduced masses, given by mnn = mn/2 and mnnc = 2Amn/(A + 2), with A ≡ mc/mn.
The core is assumed structureless with the two neutrons in a singlet spin state to ensure the antisymmetrization of
the halo wave function. We observe that, as large is the halo neutron orbit, better is the assumption of a structureless
core from the point of view of the full antisymmetrization of the nuclear wave function.

The spectator functions in the renormalized three-body model are the solution of a coupled set of homogeneous
integral equations, which correspond to the Faddeev equations for the zero-range interaction subtracted at a given
scale. Besides the n − n and n − c energies, within the zero-range model we need to provide a regularization scale,
which is given by an energy parameter −µ2. This regularization is done by ﬁxing S2n. The value of µ can be moved
towards inﬁnity, generating a tower of Thomas-Eﬁmov excited states. The log-periodic behaviour of the spectator
functions appear in the ultraviolet region, not aﬀecting the low momentum part of the wave function that indeed
runs to a limit cycle. This behaviour is explored in detail in [18]. It was also found an universal ratio between the
magnitude of the log-periodic spectator functions in the limit of µ → ∞, which is a function of only the mass ratio
A. We noticed that in practice the ﬁrst cycle is enough to get the properties of the wave function in the infrared
momentum region, which is acceptable for our purposes of computing the width of the momentum distribution. This
happens because in the actual cases of for example, 11Li and 22C, one ﬁnds that µ2 (cid:29) S2n. Therefore, our calculation
of the scaling law for the width of the core recoil momentum distribution is close to the universal limit cycle already
in the ﬁrst cycle. We have checked in [14] that correlation between the width and S2n of the ground, ﬁrst and
second excited states are quite close and in practice the limit cycle for this scaling law is achieved with the ground
state calculation, of the renormalized zero-range three-body model (see e.g.
[28]), namely given by the subtracted
Skorniakov and Ter-Martirosian equations for mass imbalanced systems [32].

The utility of a scaling function in few-body physics was recognized long ago by Phillips [33] in the analysis of the
doublet neutron-deuteron scattering length through the correlation with the triton binding energy, which he found
quite model independent. In the 80’s Eﬁmov showed that the origin of the model independence of the “Phillips line” is
the universal long range potential, which emerges close to the unitary limit (inﬁnite two-body scattering length). Our
approach just follows that idea, searching for the correlation between any other two three-body low-energy s−wave
observable, by using the zero-range model to compute the associated scaling law. One can use a scaling function to

estimate for example the value of S2n or s, knowing one of them and eventually use it to constrain some other poorly
known low-energy observable, such as a subsystem scattering length.

The scaling function for the width of the core recoil momentum distribution s, gives a correlation between s and

the energies S2n, Enc and Enn, which can be written in a general form as

where the + and − signs refer to the bound and virtual subsystem energies, respectively.
In the present speciﬁc
Borromean three-body case, we have only virtual two-body subsystems, such that both signs are negative in Eq. (9),
with Enn ﬁxed to the n − n virtual state. For the momentum distribution width, the scaling function (9) is the limit
cycle of the correlation function associated with s as a function of Enn, Enc and S2n, when the three-body ultraviolet
(UV) cut-oﬀ is driven to inﬁnite in the three-body integral equations, or equally the subsystem energies are let to zero
with a ﬁxed UV cut-oﬀ. Similar procedure is performed within a renormalized zero-range three-body model, in the
subtracted integral equations, where the subtraction energy is ﬁxed and the two-body scattering lengths are driven
towards inﬁnite. In practice, both procedures provides very close results, as shown in Ref. [34]. In the exact Eﬁmov
limit (Enn = Enc = 0), the width is a universal function of the mass number A,

In Table I we compare the results of Eq. (10) for s in the case of the Borromean halos 11Li, 14Be and 22C. The
comparison is illustrative as we are considering only the unitary limit, and therefore disregarding the small virtual
state energies of the subsystems. The dependence of s on the subsystems energies are weak, and small corrections are
present, as we have veriﬁed in [14]. In the case of 22C the calculation is poor compared to the experimental value of s
from [11], while our phenomenological analysis with values of s obtained from the ﬁts (4) and (5) are able to overlap
with the theoretical estimation due to the large uncertainties. We will present more results in the next section and
return to this discussion, despite the small eﬀects on s from Enn and Enc for a given two neutron separation energy.
We point out that, the model is validated by the comparison with the experimental values in the cases of 11Li and
14Be.

IV. SCALING ANALYSIS 22C HALO

We apply the n− n− c model to describe the halo of 22C and the results for the core recoil momentum distribution
s expressed by the scaling function (9) are shown in the right-frame of Fig. 2. We have kept ﬁxed Enn = 143 keV
and varied the energy of the virtual s−state of 21C by considering Enc/Enn equal to 0, 2, 6 and 10. We allow a
variation of Enc, by including the region where it is 1 MeV, as indicated in Ref. [9], to spam diﬀerent possibilities.
The variation of Enc with ﬁxed S2n and Enn does not show a dramatic eﬀect, as we have pointed out in [14]. We also
present the scaling function at the unitary limit (10), and is quite close to the results with ﬁnite values of Enc and

Enn, showing very clearly in the model that S2n is the dominating scale in the core recoil momentum distribution in
the three-body halo at low momentum. In addition, for large values of S2n, i.e., when S2n is much larger than Enn
and Enc, the scaling function tends to approach the unitary result, as expected.

The matter radius is another quantity that we can compute from the halo neutron orbit radius with respect to the

n(cid:105), which can also be written in terms of a scaling function [35], such that

center of mass,(cid:112)(cid:104)r2

This allows us to compute the matter radius, as

ﬁndings of [2], where we plot the correlation between(cid:112)(cid:104)r2

Only by considering the 22C extracted matter radius of 5.4(9) fm [1], the conclusion of [2], based on the model we are
following here, was that S2n is below 100 keV. However, in view of the new data on the core momentum distribution,
we ought to include it on the analysis of the two-neutron separation energy. The right frame of Fig. 2 summarize the
m(cid:105) and S2n. The virtual s− state energy of 21C is chosen to
be 0 and 1 MeV [9], with ﬁxed Enn = 143. In the case of Enc = 0, the matter radius is compatible with S2n < 100
keV, while by increasing the Enc the upper limit for S2n decreases, as shown by the results obtained for Enc = 1
MeV. This happens because the interaction becomes weaker as the Enc increases; and, for a given three-body binding
energy, the system has to shrink [35]. This is the eﬀect behind the decrease of the possible values of S2n, when the
21C virtual state energy is varied from 0 to 1 MeV.

We have data extracted from experiments for the width s of the core recoil momentum distribution and the matter
radius of 22C. Then, we just built the correlation between these quantities and analyse the data in view of the scaling
function of our model. The left-frame of Fig. 3 shows the correlation between the rms matter radius and s for the
values of Enc equal to 0 and 1 MeV. For a given matter radius s increase by changing Enc from 0 of to 1 MeV. The
variation is noticeable, about a factor of 2. That eﬀect is a reminiscent of the contraction of the wave function by

matter radius and the lower bound of s = 20±15 MeV/c. Just by adopting s = 31 MeV/c the matter radius basically
goes to the core radius ∼ 3 fm. The lower bounds of 20±15 MeV/c and 34±21 MeV/c, taken together with the scaling

The right-frame of Fig. 3 completes our analysis of the two-neutron separation energy in 22C. We show S2n as
a function of s. The data values for s suggest that S2n could have larger values than estimated before, and stay
above 100 keV. Taking as reference the data with the average between positive and negative momentum around the

separation energy about 800 keV and 900 keV, respectively. The neutron halo of 22C in this case would be quite small
compared to the corresponding one in 11Li, and possibly would not justify the increase of the reaction cross section
of 22C compared to the neighbour nuclei, 19C and 20C, as observed by Tanaka and collaborators [1], in the collision
of 22C on a liquid hydrogen target. This fact together with the clear presence of the narrow peak in the core recoil
m(cid:105) > 3.5 fm. The
sensitivity to the virtual s−state energy of 21C is quite small in s for a given S2n, but it has a noticeable eﬀect in the
matter radius of 22C shrinking considerably the halo as Enc runs from 0 to 1 MeV. That tension between the halo
size and the virtual state of 21C indicates that smaller values of Enc below 1 MeV are preferred by our analysis. We
rely on the dominance of the Eﬁmov physics on the halo properties and in the Serber model to interpret the data on
the core recoil momentum distribution.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The core recoil momentum distribution of Borromean neutron-rich isotopes of light exotic nuclei is studied within a
three-body model constituted by a core and two neutrons, where the interaction is dominated by the s−wave channel.
We adopt a renormalized three-body model with a zero-range force, that naturally accounts for the universal Eﬁmov
physics. Our model is adequate to describe a two-neutron halo weakly bound to a core nuclei, where these neutrons
explore with a high probability the classically forbidden region well outside the core. In addition, the n− c scattering
length should be larger than the interaction range. These conditions are well satisﬁed by the Borromean halo of 11Li,
the prototype of a weakly-bound radioactive halo nuclei at the neutron drip line.

The core momentum distribution was calculated from the halo wave function in momentum space, obtained from

the numerical solution of the subtracted homogeneous Skorniakov and Ter-Martorisyan coupled equations for the
zero-range interaction in the the mass imbalanced case. The inputs are the two-neutron separation energy and the
energies of the singlet n − n and n − c virtual states. We calculated the momentum probability densities for the
Borromean exotic nuclei 11Li, 14Be and 22C. A fair reproduction of the experimental data was obtained in the case
of the core recoil momentum distribution of 11Li and 14Be without resorting to free parameters.

We suggest a simple method to separate out the cross-section data for the fragmentation of the 22C the narrow
peak in the core recoil momentum distribution associated with the breakup of the halo structure. For that aim, we
performed the subtraction of a wide distribution associated with the core recoil momentum momentum distribution
observed for 20C. Indeed, the data for the fragmentation diﬀerential cross-section for the core momentum above
100 MeV/c in 22C and 20C seems indistinguishable, which indicates that the two neutrons in the wide part of the
distribution come from inner part of the orbits localized within the core. The inverse of the diﬀerence between those
cross-sections, after averaging them for positive and negative momentum, present a linear behaviour with p2, which
allows to extract the width of the momentum distribution. We apply the same ﬁtting procedure to the diﬀerence of
cross-sections but without the average. With these values at hand, we proceed to make a combined analysis of the
width of the core recoil momentum distribution and matter radius for 22C.

and s, and the reference the value of sav = 20 ± 15 MeV/c, one gets: (cid:112)(cid:104)r2

We computed the scaling functions correlating s, S2n and the virtual state energies of the two-body subsystems, and
also the scaling functions correlating the matter radius with these quantities. From the scaling function correlating s
and S2n and the experimental data for s equal to 31 MeV/c [11], 20±15 MeV/c and 34±21 MeV/c, it is suggested that
S2n could be well above 100 keV larger than previous estimations. From the correlation between the matter radius
m(cid:105) ∼ 3.5 fm and S2n ∼ 400 keV. However,
the values of 31 MeV/c and 34±21 MeV/c (5) suggest much larger values of the two-neutron separation energy, about
800 keV and 900 keV, respectively. In these last two cases, the halo of 22C would be quite small compared to the
corresponding one in 11Li, and we believe that it would not justify the increase of the reaction cross section of 22C
compared to the neighbour nuclei, 19C and 20C, as the experiment by Tanaka and collaborators [1] is showing. In
addition, by considering that it is clear the evidence of the presence of a narrow peak in the core recoil momentum
distribution, as our analysis, model independent, is pointing out, it seems preferential that s < 20 Mev/c, S2n < 400
Our study also shows that the sensitivity of the width of the 22C core momentum distribution to the virtual s−state
energy of 21C is quite small for S2n ﬁxed, but the matter radius is quite sensitive to it. The variation of the virtual
state of 21C from 0 to 1 MeV shrinks considerably the matter radius. Such a tension between the halo size and
the virtual state of 21C suggests, within our analysis, that smaller values of Enc below 1 MeV are preferred. Such
conclusion is based on the belief that the Eﬁmov physics, expressed by the calculated scaling laws, dominates the halo
properties, and also by considering the validity of the Serber model to interpret the data on the core recoil momentum
distribution. In short, the combined analysis of the core momentum distribution and matter radius for 22C, on the
basis of the scaling laws computed close to the Eﬁmov limit, suggest: (i) a virtual state of 21C well below 1 MeV; (ii)
the overestimation of the extracted matter 22C radius; and (iii) a two-neutron separation energy of this halo nucleus
to a value between 100 and 400 keV.
