Abstract

Using in-situ Raman scattering from phosphorene channel in an electrochemically top-

gated ﬁeld effect transistor, we show that its phonons with Ag symmetry depend much more

strongly on concentration of electrons than that of holes, while the phonons with Bg symmetry

are insensitive to doping. With ﬁrst-principles theoretical analysis, we show that the observed

electon-hole asymmetry arises from the radically different constitution of its conduction and

valence bands involving π and σ bonding states respectively, whose symmetry permits cou-

pling with only the phonons that preserve the lattice symmetry. Thus, Raman spectroscopy is

Introduction

A few layer Black Phosphorus (BP) is a relatively new member of the family of 2D nanosystems

with unique properties. Unlike gapless graphene, black phosphorus is a direct band gap material

with gap ranging from 0.3 eV in bulk to 2 eV in monolayer,1–7 covering a wide range of electro-

magnetic spectrum. This is again distinctive from transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) which
exhibit a direct band gap of ∼ 1 to 2 eV only in their monolayer form. The narrow band gap of
BP (in few layer form) bridges the gap between the zero gap graphene and large band gap TMDs,

thus making BP a suitable candidate for near and mid infrared optics.8 For possible applications in
electronic devices, black phosphorus offers a good possibility with mobilitiy of ∼ 1000 cm2/V-sec
at room temperature and On-Off ratio of ∼ 105 with excellent current saturation characteristics.9
Phosphorene (as monolayer BP is referred to) lattice structure is a 2-D puckered network (Fig-

ure 1a) formed by phosphorus atoms with each atom covalently bonded to three neighbouring

atoms. An unique feature of black phosphorus is its in-plane anisotropy. The puckered orthorhom-

bic crystal structure of BP gives rise to asymmetric electronic and phonon dispersion relations:

electronic bands are more dispersive along the armchair direction than along the zigzag direction,

whereas the phonon dispersion is more dispersive along the zigzag direction.2,10,11 Along the arm-

chair direction, carriers are more mobile, as the effective mass along the zigzag direction is about

10 times larger than that of along the armchair direction.12,13 Similarly, the Hall mobility along the

armchair direction is 1.8 times the mobility along the zigzag direction .4 Single and few layers BP

absorb light (ranging from infrared to part of the visible spectrum) polarized along the armchair

axis, whereas they are transparent for polarization along the zigzag direction.2 Recent photolu-

minescence measurements on the monolayer show the existence of anisotropic excitons emitting

light, polarized along the armchair direction, with a relatively higher exciton binding energy of

For 2-D systems like graphene, electron-phonon coupling (EPC) plays a dominant role in

the resistivity behaviour at high carrier densities.16 For almost a decade, since the emergence of

graphene,17,18 Raman spectroscopy has scored over other techniques as an indispensable analytical

among various other properties. In-situ Raman scattering from monolayer MoS2 transistor have
revealed the effect of doping on the EPC strength.30

For BP too, Raman spectroscopy has shown its potential as a successful and noninvasive tech-

nique to determine the crystal orientation of black phosphorus ﬂakes.4,5,31,32 Recently Luo et.

al.33 have reported anisotropic thermal conductivity using Raman spectroscopy: the thermal con-

ductivity along the zigzag orientation exceeding that along the armchair direction by a factor of

2. The degradation of BP ﬂakes due to environmental aspects have been probed by Raman spec-

troscopy.34 With four atoms in the unit cell, out of nine optical modes, phosphorene has six Raman

active modes, out of which three prominent modes with irreducible representations A1

g, A2

g and

B2g are observed in back scattering geometry. The eigen-vectors of these modes reveal that (Figure
1c) A1

g mode involves out of plane displacements of atoms, while the atomic motions involved in

A2

g and B2g modes are along armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.

We identify and quantify the effects of doping on the Raman active phonons in phosphorene,

revealing characteristic EPC. While A1

g and A2

g phonons are affected by the doping, B2g mode

is not. Further A1

g, A2

g modes are soften and their linewidths broaden with electron doping

functional theory (DFT) calculations, which show an enhanced (reduced) EPC for A1

while remaining unaffected by holes. Experimental results are supported by ﬁrst-principle density
g and A2
g
modes with electron (hole) doping. We note that this is consistent with recent reports,35,36 which

suggest a possibility of phosphorene to be a BCS superconductor by virtue of its enhanced EPC at

high concentration of electron doping and strain .

Experimental Results and Discussions

Black phosphorus ﬂakes were exfoliated from its single crystal (M/s Smart Elements), and trans-

ferred on to a 300 nm SiO2 grown thermally on a heavily doped Si (M/s Nova Electronic Materials).

4

Immediately after exfoliation, the substrate was coated with a bilayer resist consisting of PMMA

450K/PMMA 950K to avoid degradation of black phosphorus ﬂakes.34 After careful observation

under a microscope, ﬂakes were selected and photoluminescence (PL) measurement were done to

conﬁrm the layer thickness. Figure 1b shows the optical image of the selected ﬂake. Raman spec-

trum showing the characteristic modes (namely A1

g, B2g and A2

g ) and PL, recorded from the area

marked by dashed line (Figure 1b) are shown in Figure 1c and d respectively. The observed PL
peak at ∼ 1.53 eV conﬁrms the marked portion to be a single layer phosphorene.4 Source, drain
and gate electrodes were fabricated by e-beam lithography followed by thermal evaporation of 5

nm/70 nm of Cr/Au and lift-off in acetone. A transparent solid polymer electrolyte gate consisting

of lithium perchlorate (LiClO4):polyethylene oxide (PEO) in the weight ratio of 1:8 is immedi-
ately drop casted to prevent the ﬂake exposure. Due to the nanometer thick (∼2 nm) Debye layer,
this polymer electrolyte enables doping with higher carrier concentration (almost by an order of

magnitude) as compared to 300 nm oxide gating.26 Confocal Raman and PL measurements using

532 nm excitation laser are carried out at room temperature using Labram HR-800 coupled with

a Peltier cooled CCD and a spectrometer with 1800 lines/mm grating. Spectra are recorded using

a long working distance 50X objective with numerical aperture 0.45. Spectra shown in Figure 2
were acquired for 10 seconds using a laser power of ∼ 300 µW. Electrical measurements are done
using Keithley 2400 source meters. Figure 1b shows the schematic of the experimental set up and

the inset shows the device. The device transfer characteristic is shown in Figure 1e displaying an
on-off ratio of ∼ 105 and a ﬁeld effect mobility ∼ 100 cm2/V-sec and ∼ 35 cm2/V-sec for holes and
electrons respectively. Similar asymmetric transfer characteristic curves were reported for the BP

ﬁeld effect transistors.9,37–39 In order to convert the applied gate voltage to carrier concentration

n, we have used the standard MOSFET expression n = CG (VG - VT ), where CG, VG and VT are

top gate capacitance, applied top gate voltage and threshold voltage respectively, and CG is taken
to be 1.5µF/cm2 .40 It may be noted that the threshold voltage could be different for an isolated

monolayer device and can introduce some errors in estimating n. However, the qualitative picture

and the interpretation of the results would remain unaffected.

Figure 2 shows the evolution of the Raman modes of phosphorene as a function of gate voltage

Lorentzian function (solid lines in Figure 2) to the spectra. The changes in phonon energy ∆ω
= ω(n (cid:54)=0) - ω(n=0) are depicted in Figure 3a, b and c. It can be seen that phonon softening is
observed only for the A1
g modes for electron doping(Figure 3 a, b). Hole doping has no

effect on the phonon frequencies. As can be seen in Figure 3c, the B2g mode is not affected by
either electron or hole doping. Figure 3d-f show FWHM of the three modes. The FWHM of A1

and A2

g modes increase for the electron doping and do not change for the hole doping. The B2g

linewidth does not show any signiﬁcant doping dependence. Similar phonon and linewidth trends

within a Local Density Approximation (LDA) with a parametrized form of Perdew and Zunger.44

We use an energy cutoff of 60 Ry to truncate plane wave basis used in representing Kohn-Sham

wave functions, and an energy cutoff of 240 Ry to represent charge density. Structures are relaxed

till the Hellman-Feynman force on each atom is less than 0.03 eV/Å. We have used a periodic

supercell to simulate a phosphorene sheet, with a vacuum of 15 Å (along y-direction) to separate

its adjacent periodic images. Integrations over the Brillouin Zone (BZ) are sampled on 12x1x9 and

48x1x36 uniform meshes of k-points in the calculation of total energy and electron-phonon cou-
pling respectively. For a few concentrations of hole doping (1.3 x 1013 cm−2 and 1.8 x 1013 cm−2),
we used 72x1x54 uniform mesh of k-points in the determination of electron-phonon coupling to

ensure convergence.

Electronic structure of phosphorene (single layer BP) determined from our ﬁrst-principles cal-

culations exhibits a direct band gap of 0.89 eV (Figure 4a) at the Γ point, in good agreement

with earlier theoretical results.1 We note that the electronic structure is remarkably different along

zigzag (ΓX) and armchair (ΓZ) directions: linear dispersion along the armchair (ac) and parabolic

dispersion along zigzag (zz) directions. Electronic states at conduction band minimum (CBM) and

valance band maximum (VBM) at Γ point consist of py orbitals of phosphorous (Figure 4b). We

note that symmetries of the wavefunctions at CBM and VBM are distinct (see Figure 4c), which

lead to contrasting effects of electron and hole doping on the electron-phonon coupling (to be

explained later).

We have simulated carrier (electron and hole) doping in phosphorene by adding a small frac-

tion of electrons/holes (according to doping concentration) to the unit cell. From the changes in

frequencies of the A1

g and A2

g and A2

icantly with electron doping (A1

g modes (Figure 3g-i), it is clear that A1

g modes soften signif-
g ∼ 2 cm−1 at 1.8× 1013 cm−2) as compared
to insigniﬁcant change with hole doping. In contrast, B2g is much less affected by doping. These

g ∼ 3 cm−1 and A2

results are in qualitative agreement with our experimental observations (see Figure 3a-c). To un-

derstand these trends, we systematically determined electron-phonon coupling with carrier doping.

with atomic displacements of phonon qν.

From calculated λ for all the Raman modes as a function of carrier concentration (Figure 3j-l),

it is seen that (a) A1

g modes couple more strongly with the carriers than the B2g mode, and
(b) all the modes couple more strongly with electrons than with holes. These results are indeed

g and A2

consistent with our experiments. Strong coupling of the A1

g mode with electrons can be understood
from symmetry arguments. Ag modes (see Figure 1c) have the full symmetry of the lattice, (i.e.

distortion along these modes does not break the symmetry of the lattice) and hence all the electronic

states (i = j) have a non-zero matrix element (Eq.2). Using the same argument, matrix element (i

= j in Eq.2) vanishes for the B2g mode which breaks the symmetry of the lattice (B2g mode is

orthogonal to the Ag modes). We do ﬁnd an asymmetry in the EPC with hole and electron doping:

EPC increases with increasing concentration of electron doping while it decreases with increasing

hole concentration. This asymmetry follows from the symmetry of the electronic wavefunctions

at the VBM and CBM at Γ point. At the VBM, wavefunction is even under mirror reﬂection,

while it is odd at the CBM. As a result, the magnitude as well as the sign of the coupling matrix

(Eq.2) can be different for electron and hole doping. It is evident in Figure 3g-h and 3j-k that A1
g

10

mode is affected more strongly by electron doping than the hole doping. In contrast, A2

g mode is
affected by both electron as well as by hole doping, though the effect is stronger for electrons. To

understand this, we obtained the energies of VBM and CBM at Γ point as a function of structural

distortions obtained by freezing the eigenvectors of these modes. It is evident (Figure 5 ) that the

CBM varies more strongly than the VBM with A1

g mode (Figure5)
affects both VBM and CBM signiﬁcantly, though its effect on the CBM is slightly stronger than

g mode, whereas freezing of A2

that on the VBM. Therefore, the difference in the dependence of A1
g modes on electron and
hole doping originates from the matrix element (cid:104)ψk,i|∆Vqν|ψk, j(cid:105). The non-monotonous evolution
of CBM as a function of distortion for A1
g mode is further explained in the supplementary material.
We note that low levels of doping results in changes in the population of only the states that

g and A2

have energies close to the VBM and CBM at Γ point. Thus, the states lining the band-gap along

Γ-X direction are more relevant to our experiments than the ones along Γ-Z (energies of the states

at Z-point are too far (Fig. 4a) from the gap to be affected by low levels of doping in phosphorene

transistor). In Fig. S5a, we have shown iso-surfaces of wavefunctions of the valence and conduc-

tion bands at X-point and a diagram of their projections on p-orbitals of P. We note that the bands

at X point are doubly degenerate, and are made from px and py orbitals of P, in contrast to the
VBM and CBM at Γ point made from py orbitals. From the Fig. S5b, it is clear that the relative
phases of p orbitals of the P sublattices are the same for wave functions at X and Γ (Fig. 4c)

points. Hence, our symmetry analysis of the coupling of Raman active phonons to the states along

Γ to X is similar. Since the orbitals involved in the VBM and CBM bands at X point are different

from those at Γ point, their relative phase factors are not simple. In fact, they involve rotations

in the 3-dimensional space of bands made of two p-orbitals. Thus, their relative phases can be

meaningfully described with a Hermitian matrix that is responsible for the complex Raman tensor

relevant to the polarization dependent Raman scattering.32 To connect more closely with the results

of reference 32, we determined optical dielectric constants of structures obtained by freezing A1

g modes, respectively.

Conclusions

Our work demonstrates a phosphorene-based ﬁeld effect transistor (P-FET) with a high on-off

ratio, in which the carrier concentration in phosphorene channel can be effectively controlled by

the top-gate electrode. We have shown how in-situ Raman spectroscopy can be a powerful tool in

assessing the nature and concentration of carriers in the channel of P-FET. While the anisotropy

in its properties is expected from its structural symmetry, we uncover a remarkable electron-hole

asymmetry in the coupling between its charge carriers and phonons: phonons with Ag symmetry

couple much more strongly with electrons than with holes. Further, only the phonons preserving

the symmetry of the lattice couple strongly with electrons. Our ﬁrst-principles calculations reveal

that the electron-hole asymmetry arises from rather different characters of conduction and valence

bands involving π and σ bonding states respectively.
The angular dependence of the intensities of A1

g and B2g phonons in black phosphorus
(BP) has been recently well studied.32 It is shown that for reproducing experimental results for

g, A2

intensities of Ag modes, the Raman tensor has to be complex whereas for B2g, real values of Raman

tensor elements can explain the angular dependence. The complex values of the Raman tensor can

arise both from electron-radiation as well as electron-phonon matrix elements. An interesting

aspect brought out is that the imaginary part of the Raman tensor elements is different for the two

totally symmetric modes A1

g , pointing out that electron-phonon interaction is a key factor
responsible for the complex values of the tensor. In our work, we have shown that electron-phonon

g and A2

coupling (EPC) associated with A1

g modes vary predominantly with electron doping. Our
experiments did not focus on the angular dependence of the Raman intensities. The work of Ref.

g and A2

32 by Ribeiro et.al. points out an interesting future possibility to study the angular dependence

of Raman intensities of Ag modes as a function of carrier concentration and see how the relative

12

phase factor (i.e. the imaginary part of the Raman tensor elements) for the Ag mode varies. This

will further quantify the contribution of electron-phonon matrix elements to the real and imaginary

parts of the Raman tensor elements. Our work is fundamental to understanding the transport in

phosphorene and key to measurement of carriers in phosphorene-based nanoelectronic devices.

Electron-Hole Asymmetry in the Electron-phonon Coupling in Top-gated Phosphorene Tran-

sistor

Experimental Results for the Multilayer BP

We observe similar trends for Ag and B2g modes for a top-gated multilayer BP (∼ 9 layers) device.
The transfer characteristics are shown in ﬁgure SF6. The ﬁeld effect mobilities were estimated to

be 40 cm2/V-sec and 25 cm2/V-sec for holes and electrons, respectively. Raman spectra showing

the evolution of different modes at different top gate voltages are shown in ﬁgure SF7 a and b.

The frequency and linewidth pattern are similar to what we have demonstrated for monolayer.

For doping with electrons, the A1

g and A2

g modes soften (ﬁgure SF8 a and b) while remaining

unchanged for hole doping. The FWHM for these modes increase for electron side only (ﬁgure

SF8 d and e). The B2g mode is not affected by gating as evident from frequency and linewidth

trends in ﬁgure SF8 c and f, respectively.

Electronic Structure of Phosphorene

Figure SF9 a shows electronic structure of phosphorene calculated using DFT where the conduc-

tion bands CBM and CBM+1 are marked. Figure SF9 b shows the isosurfaces of wavefunctions

of CBM and CBM+1 with structural distortion of A1
g mode for 0.04 Å and 0.06 Å, that reveal the
band inversion between CBM and CBM+1 bands. The py orbitals get ﬂip by 1800 s i.e. ψ = -ψ

conﬁrming band inversion of CBM and CBM+1. This can be the reason for the non-monotonous

dependence of CBM energy on the structural distortion associated with the A1

g mode shown in
Figure 5 in the main text. This may also be relevant to studies of excited state properties of black

phosphorus. Isosurfaces of wavefunctions at VBM and CBM at the X-point along with a schematic

seen in the same reference frame across the red dashed line, we observe that py orbitals get ﬂipped

similar.
