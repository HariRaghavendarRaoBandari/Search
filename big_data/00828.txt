We study out-of-equilibrium dissipative gases of atoms excited to multiple high-lying atomic
levels. The relative strength of the intra-level and the inter-level interactions has great implications
for the emerging phenomenology. When the inter-level interactions are dominant the dynamics
is characterized by homogeneous domain formation, while stronger intra-level interactions lead to
heterogeneous domains with an alternating arrangement of excitations. Such patterns dominate
throughout the non-equilibrium evolution of the system, but they eventually subside into the fully
de-correlated stationary state. Before this happens partial equilibrium occurs within each domain,
leading to a metastable dynamics that may persist for long times. In experimental settings, where
the lifetimes and the system sizes are ﬁnite, these metastable states may take the appearance of
dynamic symmetry breaking.

Introduction. A rich phenomenology emerges from the
long-range interactions of Rydberg ensembles in the pres-
ence of dissipation. The dynamical eﬀects that have
been theoretically predicted include kinetic constrains
[1], crystallization [2–6], bistability [7–9], spatial correla-
tions and density waves in stationarity [10], aggregation
[11, 12], antiferromagnetic long-range order [13], non-
equilibrium phase transitions [14], classical and quantum
glassiness [15], many-body entanglement [16, 17] and self-
similarity [18, 19]. Some of these phenomena, includ-
ing correlations [20–22], crytallization [23], kinetic con-
straints [24], aggregation eﬀects [25, 26] and bimodality
[25, 27, 28] have already been observed in experiments,
which highlights the adequacy of these systems for the
experimental study of quantum many-body dynamics.

While single-component systems, where a single transi-
tion to a Rydberg state is driven, have been the focus of
many eﬀorts, the dynamics of multi-component Rydberg
gases —i.e. systems with atoms excited to several Ryd-
berg states— remains largely unexplored. One can antic-
ipate that several competing length scales will arise from
the interplay between intra-level and inter-level interac-
tions (i.e. the interactions between atoms excited to the
same or diﬀerent levels, respectively). Indeed, a few theo-
retical studies have started exploring such eﬀects [29, 30],
and more importantly there is an increasing number of
experiments that start probing the dynamics of Rydberg
systems with multiple excited states [31–33].

The study of multi-component systems may help to
further the strong analogies between the dynamics of dis-
sipative Rydberg gases and soft-matter systems [1, 12,
15]. This connection ultimately originates from the Ry-
dberg blockade eﬀect [34, 35], whereby an excitation of a
given atom prevents that of neighboring atoms, an eﬀect
reminiscent of the excluded-volume interactions charac-
teristic of soft-matter systems such as liquids and colloids
[36]. These systems are often mixtures composed of more

than one kind of particle, and such dispersity can give rise
to interesting collective physics that is not present in the
monodisperse case, see e.g. [37]. Furthermore, it is com-
mon when modelling soft matter computationally to con-
sider “non-additive” mixtures, meaning mixtures where
the cross interactions between diﬀerent kinds of particles
are not given by those between similar kinds: for exam-
ple, if particles A and B interact among themselves with
typical distances σA and σB, respectively, the distance
for cross interaction is such that σAB (cid:54)= (σA + σB)/2, as
in e.g. [38]. While non-additivity is an artiﬁcial construct
in the classical case (used for example to increase frus-
tration in models liquids, thus preventing crystallization
and promoting glass formation), in the case of atomic
Rydberg gases non-additivity is an actual experimentally
realizable physical feature.

In this work, we elucidate the phenomenology of
multicomponent dissipative Rydberg gases far from
equilibrium. We start by developing an eﬀective theory
for the dynamics of systems with any number of com-
ponents. The emerging phenomenology is characterized
by the formation of domains, whose nature depends on
the relative strength of the interactions. We show how
these domains may, in some circumstances, reach partial
equilibration (in which detailed balance is achieved
for a given atomic transition),
leading to metastable
behavior. In experimental settings, with ﬁnite lifetimes
and mesoscopic sizes, these metastable conﬁgurations
will appear as non-equilibrium symmetry-broken states.

Theory. We consider a system of N atoms, each of
which can be in one of p + 1 levels, the ground state |0(cid:105),
and p > 1 Rydberg states |1(cid:105), |2(cid:105), . . .|p(cid:105), with energies
E0 < E1 < E2 < ··· < Ep. See Fig. 1 (a) for an ilustra-
tion of the two-component case. Atoms in the Rydberg
states |s(cid:105) and |s(cid:48)(cid:105) at positions rk and rm interact through
α /|rk − rm|α with expo-
a power-law potential V ss(cid:48)

km = C ss(cid:48)

of a generic site k. For simplicity, we assume that the
atoms sit in the sites of a chain with lattice constant
a. A transition involving the excited level |s(cid:105) at site k,
whether it is an excitation |0(cid:105)k → |s(cid:105)k or a de-excitation
|s(cid:105)k → |0(cid:105)k, occurs with the following rate:

where ˆrk = rk/a. The relevant length scales are given by
the intra-level, Rs = a−1 [2C s
α/γs]1/α, and the inter-level
interaction parameters, Rss(cid:48)
α /γs]1/α, which
are the reduced distances at which the appearance of
excitations of a given component correlate diﬀerent sites.
Experiments typically probe the dynamics starting
from an initial state where all atoms are in the ground
state, and this will be our choice as well. At the initial
stages distant excitations to any level occur indepen-
dently of each other with a rate that is O(1). This gives
an “initial seed” for the correlated dynamics: as soon as
the distance between excitations becomes comparable
with Rs and/or Rss(cid:48)
s , the second term in Eq. (3) strongly
correlates the atoms, and the transitions between the
ground state and a particular level become less likely due
to the presence of nearby excited particles [see Fig. 1 (b)].

Phenomenology. We next turn to a numerical exploration
of the phenomenology that emerges from this dynamics.
As the dynamics is rich in collective eﬀects, we start from
the simplest possible case of a two-component system
with symmetric interaction parameters, R1 = R2 ≡ R
2 ≡ Rc. In keeping with the aim to sim-
and R12
plify the parameter space as much as possible, we further
assume Ω2
2/γ2, and rescale the time variable by
Ω2
1/γ1. The expression in brackets on the rhs of Eq. (3)
/|ˆrk − ˆrm|α for
transitions between |0(cid:105)k and |1(cid:105)k, and an equivalent ex-
pression for the transition between |0(cid:105)k and |2(cid:105)k is ob-
tained by swapping n(m)
. We focus our study
on three generic cases: (i ) R > Rc, (ii ) R ∼ Rc and
(iii ) R < Rc. Cases (i ) and (iii ) are examples of non-
additive interactions, R (cid:54)= Rc. We expect that in case (i )
the excitations of one component will be surrounded by
excitations of the other component, in an anticorrelated
pattern, as in the upper panel of Fig. 1 (b). By analogy,
in case (iii ), one expects the clustering of excitations of
a given component, as in the lower panel of Fig. 1 (b).

This phenomenology is indeed observed using kinetic
Monte-Carlo simulations in a 1D chain of van der Waals-
interacting atoms (α = 6). We focus on a mesoscopic
system of size N = 20, as such sizes are accessible by
current experiments, and use periodic boundary condi-
tions to prevent uncontrolled boundary eﬀects. In Fig.
2 we show representative trajectories for cases (i ), (ii )

α depends on the speciﬁc structure of the atomic spec-
trum and can moreover be controlled through e.g. elec-
tric ﬁeld induced F¨orster resonances [39] or microwave
dressing [40, 41]. Typically encountered exponents are
α = 6 (van der Waals interaction) and α = 3 (dipole-
dipole interaction) [42]. Each of the Rydberg states is
resonantly coupled to the ground state by a laser ﬁeld,
and aﬀected by dephasing noise [24–26]. The dynam-
ics of the system is governed by a Master equation of
Lindblad form ∂tρ = Lρ + D(ρ) [43]. The coherent part
Lρ = −i[H0 + H1, ρ] includes an interaction Hamiltonian

and (iii ) for ﬁxed R = 2 and varying Rc, where an atom
appears in red if it is in the excited state |1(cid:105), in blue
if it has been excited to |2(cid:105), and in white if it is in the
ground state. Analogous results for four components are
presented in the SM [45]. For Rc = 1/2 (R > Rc), the
excitation pattern forms something that can be described
as heterogeneous domains of alternating excitations of
one and the other component, with some defects [Fig.
2 (a)]. For Rc = 8 (R < Rc), where the proximity of
heterogeneous neighbors is penalized, large homogeneous
domains (i.e. regions where there are only excitations of
a given component) are seen to exist throughout most of
the non-equilibrium evolution of the system [Fig. 2 (c)
and (d)]. Whether one sees a homogeneous domain of
one or the other component depends on the small imbal-
ances that may occur at the initial stages of the process.
Indeed, in Fig. 2 (c) at some point, the appearance of
“intruding” excitations (one of them has been magni-
ﬁed) leads to the replacement of a large component |1(cid:105)
domain by a similar one made up of excitations of com-
ponent |2(cid:105). In other trajectories, like that shown in Fig.
2 (d), domains of a given component dominate through-
out the non-equilibrium regime. As for Rc = 2 [R = Rc,
Fig. 2 (b)], corresponding to additive interactions, ex-
cited atoms are as likely to be found close to excitations
of either component throughout the evolution of the sys-
tem. As in polydisperse mixtures of classical particles,
non-additivity brings richness into the dynamics.

With increasing time, the lattice ﬁlls with more and
more excitations. Eventually these highly structured
conﬁgurations disappear and the system settles into the
stationary state of the master equation, which is the iden-
tity operator, ρst ≡ 2− N
2 ⊗k Ik. Accordingly, in the eﬀec-

k(cid:104)n(k)

1 (t)(cid:105) = Tr(n(k)

(a) we show (cid:104)n1(t)(cid:105) ≡ (1/N )(cid:80)

tive dynamics the stationary state is such that the aver-
age number of atoms in each level is N/(p + 1). In Fig. 3

of atoms in the excited state |1(cid:105), as a function of time.
Here, (cid:104)n(k)
1 µ(t)). We again ﬁx R = 2, and
look at Rc = 1/2, 2 and 8. The density of excitations for
the two extreme values, Rc = 1/2 and Rc = 8, is seen to
increase until it reaches a long plateau at (cid:104)n1(t)(cid:105) ≈ 0.23.
Much later another increase leads the system towards the
sationary state (see the black horizontal line). While the
average results for (cid:104)n(k)
2 (t)(cid:105) are identical, single trajec-
tories are highly ﬂuctuating, a situation reminiscent of
dynamic symmetry breaking.

To gain insight into the relaxation behavior it is useful
to consider the density of excitation blocks, i.e. excited
atoms whose right neighbors are also excited. We con-
sider separately homogeneous and heterogeneous blocks,
which are made up of same-component or diﬀerent-
component excitations respectively. The former type is
shown enclosed in a continuous-line box and the latter
in a dashed-line box in the inset of Fig. 3 (b), where we
show the density of homogeneous (continuous line) and
heterogeneous blocks (dashed line). The block density
in the stationary state is indicated by a black horizontal
(cid:105)/N = 2/(p + 1)2
line. This is (cid:104)n(i)
for homogeneous blocks, and the same value can be eas-
ily seen to apply to heterogenous blocks. For Rc = 1/2
the density reaches the plateau in Fig. 3 (a) at the time
the concentration of heterogeneous blocks gets close to
the equilibrium value, and the ﬁnal push into stationar-
ity corresponds to an equivalent move on the part of the
concentration of homogeneous blocks. For Rc = 8, we see

the opposite behavior: the plateau is reached ﬁrst when
the homogeneous blocks attain the equilibrium value, and
stationarity is achieved after a long wait when the het-
erogeneous blocks reach that value as well. In which case
it takes shorter or longer for the homogeneous or the het-
erogeneous blocks to reach the equilibrium value can of
course be inferred from the rates in Eq. (3). The case
where Rc = R = 2 unsurprisingly shows a simultane-
ous equilibration of both types of blocks, and therefore
stationarity is reaches without an intermediate plateau.
These results suggest that the domain structure re-
mains in place for very long times before reaching sta-
tionarity. To clarify this we consider the probability dis-
tribution of the following order parameter

which we use to study homogeneous domains. Bimodal
distributions indicates very strong dominance of one com-
ponent, while a narrow unimodal distribution that peaks
at zero indicates the existence of conﬁgurations where
both components are strongly mixed. We deﬁne a similar
parameter that gives an alternating sign to consecutive
excitations along the chain for the study of heterogeneous

The probability distribution of P± across time for
R = 2, Rc = 1/2, 2 and 8 is shown in Fig. 4 (a), (b)
and (c), respectively. For Rc = 1/2 [Fig. 4 (a)], P−(t)
has a relatively wide distribution that narrows down as
the system approaches stationarity, indicating the loss of
order. We see that the presence of defects makes the dis-
tribution unimodal even for short times. For Rc = 2 [Fig.
4 (b)], P+(t) is narrowly distributed around zero, which
means that the occurrence of excitations of both compo-
nents is very similar in all realizations of the dynamics.
This case can be in principle analyzed with P−(t) as well,
yielding a very similar distribution to that obtained for
P+(t) (not shown here).

A richer phenomenology occurs when Rc > R [Rc = 8,
Fig. 4 (c)], where a clearly bimodal distribution is seen
throughout the non-equilibrium evolution of the system.
Initially, two branches are formed symmetrically around
zero, separated by a region of very low probability of oc-
currence. This corroborates the role of the initial seed in
leading the system to domains of either component. The
two peaks of P+(t) separate more and more until they
saturate. Later on, the homogeneous domain structure
starts crumbling upon the appearance of excitations of
the non-dominant component. This is illustrated in Fig.
4 (d), where the curves corresponding the distributions
shown in (c) at times t = 102, 104 and 108 are shown.

The saturation value for Rc > R is |P+| (cid:39) 0.5, which
corresponds to a metastable state of the dynamics, as
we now explain. In the two-component case, the right-
hand side of Eq. (2) contains two terms for each site.
Within a homogeneous domain of, say, component |1(cid:105),

between |0(cid:105) and |1(cid:105) dominate. The corresponding term
1x − I (k)
reaches a “partial equilibrium” when σ(k)
1 µ
is as likely to create excitations as de-excitations, i.e.
when there are as many atoms in the ground state as
they are in state |1(cid:105), P+(t) = 0.5. Detailed balance
is then satisﬁed for that atomic transition. A similar
behavior is observed in four-component systems [45].

Outlook. We have derived an eﬀective theory for a
multi-component Rydberg gas in the presence of noise.
When the interactions are non-additive, the emerging
phenomenology displays a domain structure that depends
sensitively on the initial excitations. For large inter-
species interactions this leads to a metastable dynam-
ics that corresponds to the partial equilibration of a
transition between the ground state and the dominant
excited state. Whether the phenomenology persists at
the qualitative level when the dissipation is only mod-
erately strong or even weak compared to the driving, as
has been recently shown to occur in the case of single-
component Rydberg gases [19], is an interesting ques-
tion that remains to be studied, as is the general role
of quantum ﬂuctuations [46]. The possibility that the
(to some extent) tunable exchange interaction of Ryd-
berg gases [39] can open up new relaxation pathways in
multi-component systems will be explored in the future.

EFFECTIVE EQUATIONS OF MOTION OF A GAS OF RYDBERG ATOMS EXCITED TO MULTIPLE

LEVELS IN THE PRESENCE OF STRONG DISSIPATION

We consider a gas of N atoms in a lattice. The ground state |0(cid:105) of each atom is resonantly coupled by laser ﬁelds
to the Rydberg states |1(cid:105) ,|2(cid:105) , . . . ,|p(cid:105) (with energies such that E0 < E1 < ··· < Ep). The Master equation is then
given by ∂tρ = L0ρ + L1ρ, where L0 contains the interaction Hamiltonian and the dissipator, and L1 gives the time
evolution due to the driving. For the derivation below, where L1 will be treated as a perturbation, this is more
convenient than the more physical decomposition into a coherent part and a dissipator that is used in the main text.
The Liouvillian superoperator L0 is deﬁned as

L0ρ = −i[H0, ρ] +

s = |s(cid:105)k(cid:104)s| and γs is the dephasing rate of |s(cid:105) w.r.t. |0(cid:105). Atoms in the Rydberg states |s(cid:105) and |s(cid:48)(cid:105) at positions
α /|rk − rm|α with exponent α. For simplicity we denote

where n(k)
rk and rm interact through a power-law potential V ss(cid:48)
the intra-level interactions by V s

km. As a result, the Hamiltonian H0 can be written as

km instead of V ss

The superoperator L0 therefore consists of a Hamiltonian part and a dissipator whose individual terms commute.
Additionally, we have the driving term, which in the rotating-wave approximation becomes

The oﬀ-diagonal entries of the density matrix are seen to decay exponentially, a fact that is not altered by the
action of the coherenct dynamics given by H0, which is diagonal in the product basis formed by single particle states
|0(cid:105)k,|1(cid:105)k ,|2(cid:105)k , . . . ,|p(cid:105)k. Therefore, the evolution under L0 becomes, at time scale much larger than the inverse of the
dephasing rates, a projector P on the diagonal of ρ in that same basis
t→∞ eL0tρ = diag(ρ),

Pρ = lim

as happens in the case of just one Rydberg level [1]. The removal of all coherences leads to a diagonal density matrix,
where each classically accessible conﬁguration (e.g. |00100203··· 1(cid:105)) is given a certain probability of occurrence.
Using the projector operator P and its complement Q = 1 − P, we can formulate the eﬀective evoluton equation
for the diagonal density matrix µ = Pρ describing the slow evolution. To second order in L1, the general expression
is given by

In this case PL1µ = 0 and QeL0tQL1P = eL0tL1P. We next calculate the integrand in Eq. (S8),

∂tµ = PL1µ +

reported in the main text we focus on the two-component case, p = 2. However, both the main observations on the
phenomenology and the theoretical arguments given there can be extended without great diﬃculty to the p > 2 case.
In this section we brieﬂy report some results for p = 4. For the sake of simplicity, we again use a somewhat idealized
parameter choice according to which all the intra-level interaction parameters, which we collectively denote as R, are
equal to one another, while all the inter-level interaction parameters, denoted as Rc, are also equal among themselves.
We focus on the Rc > R case, where homogeneous domains emerge, as it gives the richest phenomenology. More
speciﬁcally, we consider R = 2 and Rc = 8, which coincides with the parameter choice used in the main text.
In Fig. S1 (a), we see one representative trajectory of a system of N = 20 atoms with van der Waals interactions.
The color coding is such that red corresponds to state |1(cid:105), green to |2(cid:105), cyan to |3(cid:105), magenta to |4(cid:105) and white to ground
state atoms. While there are some initial excitations to |1(cid:105), they ﬁnally de-excite and are replaced by excitations to
|4(cid:105), which by then has become the dominant component. The large homogeneous |4(cid:105)-domain that emerges is later
replaced by a |3(cid:105)-domain. At longer times, two domains, corresponding to |1(cid:105) and |4(cid:105) coexist. Eventually, when
stationarity is approached, the system undergoes a strong mixing of all the components.

FIG. S1. (Color online) Individual trajectory and probability distribution of the order parameter P4+ at t = 102
for a p = 4 system with R = 2 and Rc = 8. (a) Representative trajectory. The color coding is such that red corresponds to
state |1(cid:105), green to |2(cid:105), cyan to |3(cid:105), magenta to |4(cid:105) and white to ground state atoms. (b) Probability distribution of P4+(t) at
t = 102. The histogram is based on 1000 kinetic Monte Carlo realizations.

To quantify the emerging dynamical order we focus on a complex order parameter that is an extension of the real

order parameter P+ that was proposed in the main text for p = 2 [see Eq. (4)]. It is deﬁned as follows

N(cid:88)

This order parameter, which has been inspired by the theory of the Potts model [2], can be easily extended to any
number of components p. In Fig. S1 (b) we show P4+(t) at t = 102, which corresponds to the time at which most
of the trajectories inspected still show one domain that spans the whole chain. The existence of as many maxima as
there are excited levels, all of them quite distant from the origin, indeed indicates that the formation of large domains
of the kind seen in Fig. 2 (c) and (d) of the main text for p = 2 occurs generically in systems with a larger number of
components as well. As in the two-component case [main text, Fig. 4 (d)], the four peaks reach the saturation value
of |P4+| (cid:39) 0.5 at later times, and eventually subside into a unimodal distribution centered around the origin when
the system approaches the stationary state.
