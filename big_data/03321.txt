The Corolla Polynomial for spontaneously

broken Gauge Theories

March 11, 2016

Abstract

In [1, 2, 3] the Corolla Polynomial C(Γ) ∈ C[ah1, . . . , ah|Γ[1/2]|

] was introduced as a graph

polynomial in half-edge variables {ah}h∈Γ[1/2] over a 3-regular scalar quantum ﬁeld theory
(QFT) Feynman graph Γ. It allows for a covariant quantization of pure Yang-Mills theory
without the need of introducing ghost ﬁelds, clariﬁes the relation between quantum gauge
theory and scalar QFT with cubic interaction and translates back the problem of renormaliz-
ing quantum gauge theory to the problem of renormalizing scalar QFT with cubic interaction
(which is super renormalizable in 4 dimensions of spacetime). Furthermore it is, as we be-
lieve, useful for computer calculations. In [4] on which this paper is based1 the formulation
of [1, 2, 3] gets slightly altered in a fashion specialized in the case of the Feynman gauge. It is
then formulated as a graph polynomial C(Γ) ∈ C[ah1, . . . , ah|Γ[1/2]|
] in two
diﬀerent types of half-edge variables {ah}h∈Γ[1/2] and {bh}h∈Γ[1/2]. This formulation is also
suitable for the generalization to the case of spontaneously broken gauge theories (in partic-
ular all bosons from the Standard Model), as was ﬁrst worked out in [4] and gets reviewed
here.

1 Introduction

1.1 Motivation

One of the curiosities of non-abelian gauge theories is the observation that gauge bosons in
the quantized theory do not possess only the two experimentally veriﬁed transversal degrees of
freedom. There is also a longitudinal one, which is not cancelled out with the timelike degree
of freedom as in quantum electrodynamics by the virtue of the Ward identity. This problem
was solved by the introduction of unphysical particles2, existing only in closed loops, the so-
called ghosts. Then, the Slavnov-Taylor identity ensures that all gauge boson amplitudes are
purely transversal. Although it was shown that this could be done in a self-consistent way, it
remained unsatisfying since there was no convenient argument despite adjusting the theory to
experimental facts. However, this question is solved in the deﬁnition of the Corolla polynomial
[2] by the introduction of cycle homology and allows, as such, a covariant quantization of gauge
ﬁelds without the need of introducing ghost ﬁelds [2, 5, 6, 7].

Furthermore, the introduction of the Corolla polynomial also clariﬁes the relation between
scalar QFT with cubic interaction and quantum gauge theory. This is done using the parametric

representation with its two Kirchhoﬀ or Symanzik polynomials and the creation of a Corolla dif-
ferential out of the Corolla polynomial making implicit use of graph homology [2]. In particular,
the parametric integrand for all gauge theory Feynman graphs, which can be created from a
3-regular scalar QFT Feynman graph Γ by shrinking edges, can be obtained whilst acting with
the Corolla diﬀerential DQCD(Γ) on the parametric integrand I(Γ) such that the parametric
integrand for gauge theory ˜IF (Γ) [2, 3] reads3 [2]

˜IF (Γ) = DQCD(Γ)I(Γ) .

(1)

It is then possible to receive the renormalized quantum gauge theory amplitude by replacing
I(Γ) by its renormalized analogue I R(Γ), i.e. the problem of renormalizing gauge theory gets
translated back to the renormalization of scalar QFT with cubic interaction (which is super
renormalizable in 4 dimensions of spacetime) [2, 5].

The aim of this paper is now to review the generalization worked out in [4] to the approach
of [1, 2, 3] to include the gauge bosons of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model (cf.
Subsection 5.2) as well as it’s scalar particles (cf. Subsection 5.3). This was achieved by ﬁrst
working out the combinatorics of labeling a 3-regular scalar QFT Feynman graph with labels
of the gauge bosons of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model and then by working out
the additional tensor structures arising from the inclusion of the Feynman rules for the scalar
particles of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model [4, 8].

1.2 Organization of this Paper

This paper is organized as follows: First we set up the notations and conventions in Section 2.
Then, we introduce the necessary graph theoretic notions in Section 3, thereby allowing us to
deﬁne the parametric representation in a slightly diﬀerent way which suits our purposes in
Section 4. With this knowledge, we are then able to introduce the several Corolla Polynomials
and Diﬀerentials in Section 5. We then end, in Section 6, with a short conclusion.

2 Notations and Conventions

2.1 Einstein summation Convention

Important in this paper and also in [2, 3, 4] is that Einstein summation convention is even
assumed (if not indicated otherwise) whenever two Lorentz indices are the same - independent
if they correspond to the space of covariant or contravariant vectors:

ηµν ηνρ := ηµν1ην1ν2ην2ρ = ηµρ

(2)

This at ﬁrst sight inconvenient looking expression allows to deﬁne the Corolla polynomial in a
more elegant way.

2.2 Feynman Rules, chosen Gauge and Dimension of Spacetime

We use the deﬁnitions for the Feynman rules given in [8] with all appearing signs chosen positive,
i.e. ηG = ηs = ηe = η = ηZ = 1. Furthermore we use the Feynman gauge throughout this paper
- this allows a more compact notation and avoids unnecessary applications of the Leibniz rule,
i.e. ξG = ξA = ξW = ξZ = 1. The relevant Feynman rules with this conventions are explicitly
listed in [4, Appendix A]. Furthermore we work in a 4-dimensional spacetime for concreteness,
even tough the Corolla polynomial is not limited to that choice.

3Actually the diﬀerent quantum gauge theory graph contributions created by the Corolla diﬀerential are
hidden in the parametric integrand ˜IF (Γ) in it’s regular part and residues along the Schwinger parameters, cf.
Subsection 5.1 (mainly Theorem 5.6).

2.3 Feynman Graphs with oriented Edges

In the Standard Model some particle types have oriented edges (fermions, ghosts, W ±-particles,
ϕ±-particles). We work in this paper with unoriented edges, where a graph with unoriented
edges is understood as the sum of all graphs with all possible edge orientations times their
corresponding symmetry factor (cf. Deﬁnition 3.3).

3 Graph theoretic Notions

A QFT is characterized by it’s Lagrangian density which dictates the set’s RV and RE of all
possible vertex- and edge-types, respectively [5]. This states all allowed particle interactions
and particle types out of which Feynman graphs can be built of. Now, we provide all necessary
graph theoretic notions:

Deﬁnition 3.1 (Feynman graph, in parts literally quoted from [9, Deﬁnition 1]). A Feynman
graph Γ is characterized by a set of vertices Γ[0] and a set of edges Γ[1] = Γ[1]
int whose
elements are part of RV and RE, respectively, and a set of maps

ext ∪ Γ[1]

∂j :

Γ[1] 7→ Γ[0] ∪ {1, 2, . . . , N } ,

j ∈ {0, 1} ,

(3)

j=0 card ∂−1

j

respecting the vertex and edge types given by RV and RE. Furthermore the case ∂0 and ∂1
being both in {1, 2, . . . , N } is excluded. The set {1, 2, . . . , N } labels external edges of Γ, such
(v) = 1 for all v ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N }. The set of external edges is therefore deﬁned
j=0 ∂j {1, 2, . . . , N } and the set of internal edges as it’s complement with respect
ext. Therefore, external edges can be labeled by

thatP1

int := Γ[1] \ Γ[1]

ext := S1

as Γ[1]
to the set of edges of Γ, i.e. Γ[1]
e1, e2, . . . , eN ∈ Γ[1]

ext, with ek :=S1

j=0 ∂j(k).

Furthermore we omit scalar graphs with edges which form self-loops (so-called tadpoles).
This is possible without loss of generality since their amplitudes vanish during the renormaliza-
tion process4. In the gauge theory amplitudes created by the Corolla polynomial, amplitudes
from gauge theory graphs with tadpoles will show up again by the use of graph-homology, cf.
Section 5 and [2].

The two Symanzik polynomials (Deﬁnition 4.3 and Deﬁnition 4.5) are polynomials in edge-
variables {Ae}e∈Γ[1], whereas the Corolla polynomial (Deﬁnition 5.1) is a polynomial in half-
edge-variables {ah}h∈Γ[1/2] which are deﬁned as follows:

Deﬁnition 3.2 (Half-edge [2]). Let Γ be a Feynman graph, Γ[0] the set of it’s vertices, Γ[1] the
set of it’s edges and n(v) ⊂ Γ[1] the set of edges adjacent to the vertex v. Then the tuple

h := (v, e) ,

v ∈ Γ[0] , e ∈ n(v) ,

(4)

is called a half-edge of Γ. The set of all half-edges of Γ is denoted by Γ[1/2]. Note that each
internal edge deﬁnes two half-edges in a unique way, since we do not allow tadpoles (cf. Deﬁni-
tion 3.1).

Next, we deﬁne automorphisms of a Feynman graph Γ and it’s symmetry factor sym(Γ):

4Speaking in Hopf-algebraic language, the graphs with tadpoles create an Hopf ideal Itad in the Hopf-algebra

HFG of Feynman graphs and we can eﬀectively work in the quotient space HFG/Itad [2].

3

Deﬁnition 3.3 (Automorphisms and symmetry factors of a Feynman graph, in parts literally
quoted from [9, Deﬁnition 2]). Let Γ be a Feynman graph. An automorphism g of Γ is given by
an automorphism g[0] of Γ[0] and an automorphism g[1] of Γ[1] that is the identity on Γ[1]
ext and
fulﬁlling for all e ∈ Γ[1]

1[j=0

g[0](cid:0)∂j(e)(cid:1) =

1[j=0

∂j(cid:16)g[1](e)(cid:17) .

Additionally, we require g[0] and g[1] to respect the vertex and edge types given by the sets RV
and RE, respectively.

The automorphism group of Γ is denoted by aut(Γ) and consists of all such automorphisms
of Γ. The order of the automorphism group of Γ is called the symmetry factor of Γ and denoted
by sym(Γ), i.e.

(5)

(6)

sym(Γ) :=(cid:12)(cid:12)aut(Γ)(cid:12)(cid:12) .

Deﬁnition 3.4 (Paths and cycles [10]). Let Γ be a graph, Γ[0] it’s vertex set and Γ[1] it’s edge
set. Then:

1. Γ is called a path if it is non-empty with vertex set Γ[0] = {v1, v2, . . . , vv} and edge set
Γ[1] = {v1v2, v2v3, . . . , vv−1vv} (where no repeated vertices are allowed, i.e. vi 6= vj for
i 6= j). In particular a path connects it’s two endpoints in a unique way and every internal
vertex has precisely two edges attached to it. Paths are denoted by P , and sets of paths
by P.

2. Γ is called a cycle in mathematics or a loop in physics5 if it is non-empty with vertex set
Γ[0] = {v1, v2, . . . , vv} and edge set Γ[1] = {v1v2, v2v3, . . . , vv−1vv, vvv1} (where no repeated
vertices are allowed, i.e. vi 6= vj for i 6= j). In particular, a cycle can be created from the
union of two disjoint paths having the same endpoints. Cycles are denoted by C, sets of
cycles by C and bases of cycles by C.

Deﬁnition 3.5 (Trees, forests and spanning n-forests [10]). Let Γ be a graph. Then:

1. Γ is called a forest if it is non-empty and does not contain any cycles. Forests are denoted
by F and sets of forests by F . If F has n connected components, then F is also called an
n-forest and denoted by Fn and the sets of all n-forests by Fn.

2. If a forest F is connected (i.e. a 1-forest F1) it is also called a tree. Trees are denoted by

T and sets of trees by T .

3. If an (n-)forest or a tree covers all vertices of a graph Γ, then it is called a spanning (n-)-
forest of Γ or a spanning tree of Γ, respectively. The sets of all spanning (n-)forests F (Fn)
and spanning trees T of a graph Γ are denoted by F (Γ) (Fn(Γ)) and T (Γ), respectively.

Deﬁnition 3.6 (Incidence matrix, in parts literally quoted from [2, Page 7]). We deﬁne the
incidence matrix ε(Γ) of a graph Γ componentwise as follows:

εve(Γ) =

+1 if the vertex v is the endpoint of the edge e
−1 if the vertex v is the starting point of the edge e
0

if e is not incident to the vertex v

(7)

5Be aware that a loop in mathematics is what is called a self-loop or a tadpole in physics. We use the terms
cycle and loop interchangeably in the above deﬁned sense, depending if the context is more motivated from a
mathematical or a physical point of view.

4

Deﬁnition 3.7 (Assigning 4-vectors to a Feynman graph, in parts literally quoted from [2, Page
7]). We assign a 4-vector ξ′µ
e to each edge e of a Feynman graph Γ in the following way: First we
choose a basis of loops CΓ ⊂ CΓ of |CΓ| independent loops of Γ and we choose for each C ∈ CΓ
an orientation εC
ve2 with e1 and e2 being
two edges adjacent to the vertex v and inside the loop C, i.e. e1, e2 ∈ n(v) ∩ C). Then we assign
to each half-edge h ≡ (v, e) the 4-vector6

ve is deﬁned in such a way that εC

(8)

where the ξµ
the end of all calculations, and the kµ

e are independent in the sense that momentum conservation is not assumed until

C are the loop-momenta which are to be integrated out.

Deﬁnition 3.8 (Genus of a graph, in parts literally quoted from [2, Page 4]). Let Γ be a graph
and Mk an oriented manifold of genus k. Then Γ is said to be k-compatible, if it can be drawn
on Mk without self-intersections. Furthermore Γ is said to be of genus k, if it can be drawn on
Mk without self intersections, but not on Ml with l < k. Planar graphs are of genus 0.

Deﬁnition 3.9 (Orientation of a 3-regular graph, in parts literally quoted from [2, Page 4]).
Let Γ be a 3-regular k-compatible Feynman graph, drawn on an oriented manifold Mk of genus
k. Then Γ inherits an orientation by Mk which deﬁnes to each half-edge h incident to a vertex
v a unique successor h+ and predecessor h−.

4 Parametric Representation of scalar Quantum Field Theories

The parametric representation for scalar QFT’s can be obtained by the use of the so-called
Schwinger trick7 [2, 3, 5, 7]:

=ZR+

Using this trick, the product of propagators in the numerator from the standard Feynman rules
(where the pµ
e correspond to physical momentum 4-vectors, i.e. momentum conservation is
assumed) can be turned into a sum of an exponential function (where an Euclidean spacetime
is assumed8 and all appearing constants are collected in α) [3, 5, 7]:

Remark 4.1. For our purposes in deﬁning the Corolla polynomial in Section 5 we alter the
standard deﬁnition of the parametric representation of a scalar QFT in two ways: First, we will
also include Schwinger variables Ae for external half-edges and secondly we assign 4-vectors ξ′µ
e
to each edge e of Γ which we deﬁne to consist of the sum of independent variables ξµ
e and the
corresponding loop momenta kµ
C for C a loop in the basis of loops CΓ of the Feynman graph Γ
(cf. Deﬁnition 3.7).

6The notion of the half-edge h is here only important to clarify the orientation of the 4-vector ξ′µ
e .
7A similar result can be obtained using the so-called Feynman trick [5].
8This can be obtained from the Minkowski spacetime using the so-called Wick rotation [5, 6, 7].

Therefore we deﬁne the following simpliﬁed notation:

Deﬁnition 4.2 (Abbreviations [2]). We denote:

1. The simplex of our parametric integration domain by σ, i.e.

σ := R

|Γ[1]|
+

.

2. The measure of our extended parametric space by dAΓ, i.e.

dAΓ := ^e∈Γ[1]

dAe .

3. The space of all loop-momenta by ρ (recall |CΓ| to be the dimension of the basis of loops

of Γ from Deﬁnition 3.4 and Deﬁnition 3.7), i.e.9

ρ := R4|CΓ| .

4. The measure of the loop-momenta integral by dkΓ (recall that we choose a basis of loops
CΓ ⊂ CΓ of |CΓ| independent loops of Γ from Deﬁnition 3.7, and d4kC being the usual
Lorentz invariant loop-momentum measure for the loop C [5, 6, 7]), i.e.10

dkΓ := ^C∈CΓ

d4kC .

5. The extended universal quadric by Q

i.e.

spacetime, but we’re working in a 4-dimensional spacetime throughout this paper [5, 6, 7].

4-dimensional spacetime throughout this paper [5, 6, 7].

so-called Kirchhoﬀ- or Symanzik-polynomials ψΓ and φΓ

13 come into play:

Deﬁnition 4.3 (First Symanzik polynomial [2, 3, 5]). Let Γ be a scalar QFT Feynman graph
and T (Γ) the set of it’s spanning trees T . Then we deﬁne the ﬁrst Symanzik polynomial as
(external half-edges are excluded from the product)

ψΓ := XT ∈T (Γ)Ye /∈T

two components F 1

Deﬁnition 3.6). Then we deﬁne the second Symanzik polynomial as (again, external half-edges

expressions) is formally only allowed if regulators iǫ are introduced before in each such propagators and whose
limits to 0 are understood to be taken after the integrations are carried out [5, 7].

13We will slightly alter the standard deﬁnition of the second Symanzik polynomial for our purposes and denote

it by ϕΓ, cf. Deﬁnition 4.5.

Deﬁnition 4.10 (Parametric integrand for gauge theory amplitudes with non-standard second
Symanzik polynomial, in parts literally quoted from [2, Page 10]). In the following we’re in
particular interested in gauge theory amplitudes. They can be represented in the parametric
space by a slightly generalization of I(Γ) via

a rational function in the Schwinger parameters Ae and possible matrix structure. The ratio-
nal function F can be created by acting with suitable diﬀerential operators on the parametric
integrand I(Γ) and possibly multiply it with the required matrices and the contraction of their
respective Lorentz indices [2, 3].

Remark 4.11. Before I(Γ) (or ˜IF (Γ)) can be integrated against the simplex σ to yield the
Feynman amplitude I R(Γ) (or ˜I R
F (Γ)) of Γ it needs to be renormalized ﬁrst (cf. [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11]
for the huge topic of renormalization). The corresponding renormalized diﬀerential form I R(Γ)
F (Γ)) can be obtained from I(Γ) (or ˜IF (Γ)) by the use of the Forest formula [2, 3, 5, 7, 11].

5 Corolla Polynomial and Diﬀerential

5.1 Pure Yang-Mills Theory

Now we deﬁne the Corolla polynomial for pure Yang-Mills theory:

Deﬁnition 5.1 (Corolla polynomial, in parts literally quoted from [1, Deﬁnition 1] and [2, Page
27], cf. [3]). Let Γ be a 3-regular scalar QFT Feynman graph. Then:

1. Associate to each half-edge h of Γ variables ah and bh.

2. Recall from Deﬁnition 3.2: For a vertex v of Γ we denote the set of the three half-edges

incident to v by n(v).

3. Recall from Deﬁnition 3.9: For a vertex v of Γ and h ∈ n(v) a half-edge of Γ, we denote

according to the orientation of Γ it’s successor by h+ and it’s predecessor by h−.

4. We denote the edge e of which h is part of by e(h).

5. Recall from Deﬁnition 3.4: We denote the set of all cycles of Γ by CΓ.

6. For C ∈ CΓ a cycle and v a vertex in C, since Γ is 3-regular, there is a unique half-edge of

Γ incident to v and not in C. We denote this half-edge by h(C, v).

7. Assign to Γ a factor color(Γ).

8. We denote the combination of half-edge variables which will create in the Corolla diﬀeren-
tial the Feynman rules for the 3-valent gluon vertex v (and also the 4-valent gluon vertex
as residues in Schwinger parameters if applied twice with special combinations of half-edge
variables due to the Leibniz rule, cf. Theorem 5.6 and [2, 3]) as

Vv := Xh∈n(v)

9. We denote the combination of half-edge variables which will create in the Corolla diﬀeren-
tial the Feynman rules for the closed ghost loop Cj as (recall that we work with unoriented
ghost edges which means that we sum over both orientations, cf. Subsection 2.3)

GCj := Xk∈{+,−} Yv∈C[0]

ah(Cj ,v)k .

Then we can deﬁne the various summands of the Corolla polynomial for pure Yang-Mills theory
by

Furthermore, we deﬁne

Remark 5.2.

1. Note that our deﬁnition of the Corolla polynomial in the half-edge variables
ah and bh diﬀers from the ones given in [1, 2, 3], but we will also deﬁne a diﬀerent diﬀerential
operator Ah and metric tensor Bh such that the Corolla diﬀerentials D(Γ) coincide again
(despite from factors of 1/4i which were missing in each summand Di(Γ) in [1, 2], cf. [3]
and the fact that our deﬁnition does not create 4-valent ghost vertex contributions from
the start which need to be eliminated in the formulation of [1, 2, 3] while working in a
linear covariant gauge otherwise, cf. [2]). Furthermore, the above formulation, originating
from [4], is only valid for the Feynman gauge (which is in particular linear).

2. C(Γ) is a polynomial since Ci(Γ) = 0 for all i > |CΓ| [1, 2].

Γ := 3

with the six half-edges(cid:8)h1 := (a, 3), h2 = (a, 2), h3 = (a, 1), h4 = (b, 4), h5 = (b, 1), h6 = (b, 2)(cid:9).

10

Then, we have

C0(Γ) =(cid:16)bh1(cid:0)ah1+ + ah1−(cid:1) + bh2(cid:0)ah2+ + ah2−(cid:1) + bh3(cid:0)ah3+ + ah3−(cid:1)(cid:17)
×(cid:16)bh4(cid:0)ah4+ + ah4−(cid:1) + bh5(cid:0)ah5+ + ah5−(cid:1) + bh6(cid:0)ah6+ + ah6−(cid:1)(cid:17) ,

C1(Γ) = ah1+ah4+ + ah1−ah4−

and

So, in total we get:

Ci(Γ) = 0 ,

∀i > 1 .

C(Γ) =C0(Γ) − C1(Γ)

=(cid:16)bh1(cid:0)ah1+ + ah1−(cid:1) + bh2(cid:0)ah2+ + ah2−(cid:1) + bh3(cid:0)ah3+ + ah3−(cid:1)(cid:17)

(29)

Deﬁnition 5.4 (Corolla diﬀerential, in parts literally quoted from [2, Page 29]). Let Γ be a
3-regular scalar QFT Feynman graph. Then:

1. Assign to each external and internal edge a variable Ae and a 4-vector ξ′µ
e

(as in Deﬁni-

tion 3.7) and to each edge e a Lorentz index µe.

2. Deﬁne for each half-edge hk the following diﬀerential operator (where k ∈ {±}):

Ahk := −kεhk

1

∂

2Ae(hk)

∂ξe(hk)µe(h)

3. Deﬁne for each half-edge h the following metric tensor:

Bh := η

µ
e(h+)µ

e(h−)

Then, the summands of the Corolla diﬀerential Di(Γ) are deﬁned via the summands of the
Corolla polynomial Ci(Γ) by replacing each half-edge variable ahk by the corresponding diﬀeren-
tial operator Ahk (denoted by ahk 7→ Ahk ) and each half-edge variable bh by the corresponding
metric tensor Bh (denoted by bh 7→ Bh):

,

(30a)

and similarly the Corolla diﬀerential D(Γ) is deﬁned like the Corolla polynomial C(Γ) as

D(Γ) :=

.

(30b)

bh7→Bh, ∀h∈Γ[1/2]

Di(Γ) := Ci(Γ)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ahk 7→Ahk , ∀hk∈Γ[1/2]
(−1)iDi(Γ) ≡ C(Γ)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ahk 7→Ahk , ∀hk∈Γ[1/2]
∞Xi=1

bh7→Bh, ∀h∈Γ[1/2]

Likewise, the Corolla diﬀerentials DQCD(Γ) and DEW(Γ) are deﬁned via the replacement of
the half-edge variables ahk by the corresponding diﬀerential operators Ahk and the half-edge
variables bh by the corresponding metric tensors Bh in their corresponding Corolla polynomials
CQCD(Γ) and CEW(Γ) (the latter one will be deﬁned in Deﬁnition 5.19), respectively.

Remark 5.5.

1. Expressions of the form D(Γ)I(Γ) are to be understood as (where the(cid:8)qµ

are the physical 4-momenta of the scalar QFT Feynman graph Γ, i.e. momentum conser-
vation is assumed)

e(cid:9)e∈Γ[1]

D(Γ)I(Γ) :=(cid:0)D(Γ)I(Γ)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ξe7→ξe+qe,

ξe7→0 (cid:27), ∀e∈Γ[1]

,

such that the Corolla diﬀerential acts on the parametric integrand with non-standard
second Symanzik polynomial (cf. Deﬁnition 4.5 and Theorem 4.8) and after the diﬀeren-

accordance with the external momenta (cf. Remark 4.6). Note that due to the Leibniz
rule we get also contributions from diﬀerentiating the inverse external propagators PΓ (cf.
from Deﬁnition 4.2) but since the diﬀerential operators for the external edges are of
7.

tiation the standard second Symanzik polynomial is obtained by setting the(cid:8)ξµ
order 1, these contributions vanish again whilst setting the(cid:8)ξµ
2. We choose the 4-vectors (cid:8)ξµ

e(cid:9)e∈Γ[1] in
e(cid:9)e∈Γ[1] in accordance with
e(cid:9)e∈Γ[1] assigned to each edge of the graph independently,

i.e. we do not assume momentum conservation until the Corolla diﬀerential acted on the
scalar integrand (cf. Deﬁnition 3.7). Therefore, they can be seen as “temporary dummy
variables”. After applying the Corolla diﬀerential, we assume momentum conservation
and they acquire the meaning of physical 4-momentum vectors and are then denoted as

the external momenta (again, cf. Remark 4.6).

3. Di(Γ) creates, whilst acting on the corresponding parametric scalar QFT integrand I(Γ),
all possible pure Yang-Mills theory Feynman graphs with |CΓ| loops and i ghost loops. The
alternating sum in the Corolla polynomial C(Γ) and hence also in the Corolla diﬀerential
D(Γ) takes care of the minus sign for each closed ghost loop (cf. Theorem 5.6).

Theorem 5.6 ([2]). Using the above deﬁnitions, the renormalized amplitude ˜I R
F (Γ) of all gauge
theory graphs of pure Yang-Mills theory which can be achieved from Γ via graph and cycle
homology [2] is then obtained via the Corolla diﬀerential DQCD(Γ) (cf. Deﬁnition 5.4) and the
renormalized parametric integrand with non-standard second Symanzik polynomial I R(Γ) (cf.
Theorem 4.8 and again [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11] for the huge topic of renormalization)

5.2

Inclusion of the Gauge Bosons of the Electroweak Sector

The inclusion of the gauge bosons and their corresponding ghosts of the electroweak sector of the
Standard Model shows some interesting properties and is therefore the next step to adapt the
Corolla polynomial to all bosons of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. Concretely,
we have to add the massive gauge bosons W ± and Z with their corresponding ghosts c± and cZ
and the photon A with it’s corresponding ghost cA.

Outline. First, recall that we have W ±-particle conservation which implies that every vertex
of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model has to consist of a positive even number of
W ±-particles, in particular every 3-valent vertex must consist of two W ±-particles. Therefore
we deﬁne two nested sums over a 3-regular scalar QFT Feynman graph Γ in the following way:
The ﬁrst sum creates all possible ways to attach W ±-labels to Γ such that every 3-valent vertex
consists of exactly two W ±-labeled edges. Then, the second sum creates all possible ways to
attach Z-labels or A-labels to the unlabeled edges of the W ±-labeled graphs. The full details
are explained in the proof after Theorem 5.12.

Therefore, we deﬁne:

Deﬁnition 5.9. Let Γ be a 3-regular graph. Then:

1. We deﬁne the equivalence class of sets PW (Γ) to consist of all possible spanning n-forests
PW (cf. Deﬁnition 3.5) of Γ (modulo equivalence, see below) with the additional require-
ments that each of PW ’s components is an unoriented path and furthermore fulﬁlls one of
the following two conditions:

• The endpoints of the path are connected to external vertices (i.e. vertices with exter-
nal half-edges attached to it). In this case, enlarge this path by adding these external
half-edges to it.

• The endpoints of the path are connected to adjacent vertices (i.e. vertices which are
connected via one or two edges). In this case, create one or two cycles by adding one
of these edges to this path.

14

Then, each set PW ∈ PW consists of pairwise disjoint paths and cycles. Finally, we
establish an equivalence relation PW ∼ P ′
W .
Then PW is deﬁned to consist of all such equivalence classes [PW ] of Γ, to which we refer
from now on simply as PW by dropping the equivalence class brackets.

W , if PW is componentwise isomorphic to P ′

2. Let ℘(cid:16)Γ[1](cid:17) be the power set of all external half-edges and internal edges of Γ with all

the
adjacent vertices added.
power set of all external half-edges and internal edges of Γ which are not in the set PW .
We denote the elements of PZ (PW ) by PZ . The edges in each set PZ in the set of sets
PZ (PW ) are labeled by a Z-label and the edges in Γ\(PW ∪ PZ ) are labeled by an A-label.

W(cid:17), i.e.
In particular, we deﬁne PZ (PW ) := ℘(cid:16)Γ[1] \ P [1]
Z (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) denote the number of vertices in PZ and Γ \ PZ , respectively.

Z (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) and(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Γ[0] \ P [0]

3. Let(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)P [0]
(cid:8)PZ ∈ PZ (PW )|PW ∈ PW (Γ)(cid:9) isomorphic to Γlabeled.

4. Let iso (Γlabeled) be the number of labeled graphs (via the sets PW and PZ ) in the set

Example 5.10. To illustrate this, consider the graph:

Γ :=

(39)

Since we have chosen a more complicated graph in order to show some more involved cases, we
do not give all spanning forests of the graph Γ but just some examples (where the red parts of
Γ denote some of it’s spanning forests):

γ1 :=

γ2 :=

(40)

Here both forests, even though being spanning forests of Γ, are not allowed in the set PW (Γ)
since in both cases the parts of the spanning forests are not paths. The only allowed edge sets
in PW (Γ) (where the green parts of Γ denote the edge sets PW ∈ PW (Γ)) are:

γ3 :=

γ6 :=

γ4 :=

γ7 :=

troweak gauge bosons and their corresponding ghosts ˜IF (Γ) can be written as16

Proof. Recall that the Feynman rules do not allow gluons to couple to the gauge bosons of the
electroweak sector of the Standard Model. Therefore we can consider these two parts of the
Standard Model separately. Additionally note that the Feynman rules for the gauge bosons of
the electroweak sector of the Standard Model have precisely the same tensor structure than the
Feynman rules for the gluons. The only diﬀerence lies in diﬀerent factors of i, diﬀerent coupling
constants, the structure constants for the gluons and the mass terms for the massive gauge
bosons and their corresponding ghosts of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. These
|Γ[0]|
are taken in account by the factors i|Γ[1]|g
s
respectively. Moreover, notice that due to the conservation of W ±-particles each 3- or 4-valent
vertex has to consist of an even number of W ±-particles. In particular, since the 4-valent vertices
are created by the Corolla polynomial in the same fashion than for the gluons we only need to
consider the 3-valent Feynman rules, i.e. we have to sum over all possibilities to label edges
in Γ in such a way, that each 3-valent vertex consists of exactly two half-edges with label W ±
and one unlabeled half-edge. Additionally the edge type has to be respected while gluing these
3-valent vertices together. This is precisely fulﬁlled by the sets PW ∈ PW (Γ). Furthermore,
notice that the Feynman rules of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model allow each
unlabeled edge of Γ to be turned into either a Z-particle or an A-particle. This is precisely
fulﬁlled by the sets PZ ∈ PZ (PW ) for each set PW ∈ PW (Γ). Moreover, the corresponding
ghost edges have the same masses than their corresponding gauge bosons, meaning that each
component Di(Γ)I(Γ) gets the same factor J (Γ; mW , mZ ) and thus the whole contribution
created by the Corolla diﬀerential can be multiplied by the factor given in Equation (47), such
that Equation (48) holds. Since no derivatives act on the corresponding mass terms in the
parametric representation of a scalar QFT, I(Γ) can be simply multiplied by J (Γ; mW , mZ).
Finally, the possibly diﬀerent symmetry factors of Γlabeled compared to Γ are compensated by
the factor sym (Γ) / sym (Γlabeled) and the redundant number of isomorphic graphs is divided
out by iso (Γlabeled).
(cid:4)

Lemma 5.13 ([4]). Let the assumptions of Theorem 5.12 hold. Then we have

sym (Γ)

sym (Γlabeled) iso (Γlabeled)

= 1,

∀Γ .

(49)

16Note that here the Corolla diﬀerential D(Γ) is used instead of DQCD(Γ), since the additional constants are

moved into the deﬁnition of J(Γ; mW , mZ).

Proof. Note that the symmetry factors of pure electroweak gauge boson Feynman graphs are
similar to the symmetry factors of quantum electrodynamic Feynman graphs, since every vertex
possesses exactly two orientable edges of the same type and one unoriented edge of another type.
Since we have chosen to work in this paper with unoriented W ±-labeled edges, the symmetry
factors of pure electroweak gauge boson Feynman graphs are not all equal to 1, as in quantum
electrodynamics for unoriented fermion edges [5]. Moreover, note that the labeling with Z-
labels and A-labels does not change the symmetry-factors, i.e. the element PW ∈ PW (Γ) has
the same symmetry factor as all elements PZ ∈ PZ (PW ). This is true because the symmetry
factor can be deﬁned as the number of ways half-edges of adjacent vertices can be interchanged
without changing the graph. But since two edges of a vertex are of the same particle type, the
remaining particle type is ﬁxed and hence it does not matter if it is of Z-type or A-type, the
only contribution comes from the unoriented two edges of the same particle type. Furthermore,
we remark that as in quantum electrodynamics the sum of all possible orientations of unoriented
edges (which is given by the factor iso (Γlabeled)) times their symmetry factor sym (Γlabeled) is
equal to 1 [5]. Moreover, when also ghost edges come into play, the symmetry factors may also
change, but in the same way changes the number of isomorphic graphs. Finally, in [3, Lemma
5.1] it is proven that the symmetry factors work out correct while passing from 3-valent to
4-valent vertices by shrinking internal edges.

Inclusion of the scalar Bosons of the Electroweak Sector

For the inclusion of the scalar bosons from the electroweak sector of the Standard Model we
have to add four scalar particles, bringing new possible tensor structures in their Feynman rules
with them. Concretely, we have to add the Higgs boson h and the Goldstone bosons ϕ± and
ϕZ .

Outline. Again, the idea will be to deﬁne two nested sums over a 3-regular scalar QFT Feynman
graph in the following way: The ﬁrst sum creates all possible ways to attach scalar particle
labels to edges of Γ that are allowed to become a scalar edge (i.e. edges that will not become
a ghost edge) and the second sum will create all possible Feynman graphs with 4-valent scalar
vertices by shrinking suitable scalar labeled edges. Furthermore we deﬁne a third sum which
creates all particle labelings which are allowed by the Standard Model Feynman rules. The full
details are explained in the proof after Theorem 5.20.

Therefore, we deﬁne:

Deﬁnition 5.16. Let Γ be a 3-regular scalar QFT Feynman graph. Then:

k=1 C [1]

internal edges of Γ with all adjacent vertices added. In particular, we are interested in

ghost edges and are free to possibly become a Higgs or Goldstone edge. We denote the

1. Again, as in Deﬁnition 5.9, let ℘(cid:16)Γ[1](cid:17) be the power set of all external half-edges and
the set ℘(cid:18)Γ[1] \(cid:16)Si
i (cid:17)(cid:19), the power set of all edges of Γ that will not be turned into
i (cid:17)(cid:19) by PH/G.
elements of ℘(cid:18)Γ[1] \(cid:16)Si
2. Let ℘(4)(cid:16)PH/G(cid:17) be the power set of all internal edges of Γ in the set PH/G having 2 or 4
Also adjacent edges are not allowed to be in the same set P(4) ∈ ℘(4)(cid:16)PH/G(cid:17). The set

neighbors, that do not share a vertex with an edge which will be turned into a ghost edge
(also edges that will be turned into fermions edges are not allowed either, if included).

add all adjacent vertices in each edge set.

of set’s ℘(4)(cid:16)PH/G(cid:17) consists therefore of all edges in the set PH/G that are free to create
3. Let e ∈ P(4)(cid:16)PH/G(cid:17). Then we deﬁne the set of adjacent half-edges to e as H(4)(e) :=

{h1, h2, h3, h4}. In particular, we are interested in the set H(2)(e) ⊂ H(4)(e), deﬁned as

H(2)(e) :=({h1, h2}

∅

if h1, h2 /∈ PH/G and h3, h4 ∈ PH/G
if h1, h2, h3, h4 ∈ PH/G

for some arbitrary numbering 1, . . . , 4, since in the case of a 2-scalar-2-gauge boson vertex
we have to add a metric tensor with indices depending on the gauge boson edges (where
the product below in the modiﬁed Corolla polynomial in Deﬁnition 5.19 over the empty
set is deﬁned to be 0). For the 4-scalar boson vertex we just receive a coupling constant,
cf. part 5. of this deﬁnition.

4. Let L(cid:16)Γ, PH/G, P(4)(cid:17) denote the set of all possible allowed particle type labelings of the

graph Γ, with scalar particle edges PH/G and 4-valent scalar vertices P(4), compatible with
the Standard Model Feynman rules (cf. [4, Appendix A] and [8]), such that17

L(e) ∈nW ±, Z, A, h, ϕ±, ϕZo ,

e ∈ Γ[1] .

In the previous Subsection 5.2 this was created by the sets of sets PW (Γ) and PZ (PW )
for the special cases PH/G = P(4) = ∅, deﬁned in Deﬁnition 5.9.

5. Let coupling(cid:16)PH/G, P(4), L(cid:17) be the product over all factors of ±i and all coupling constants

given by the Feynman rules for Γ with labeling L (cf.
[4, Appendix A] and [8]). The
coupling constants include all 3-valent vertices and 4-scalar boson vertices (the 4-gauge
boson vertex coupling constants are created from the corresponding 3-valent ones by the
Corolla polynomial via graph homology as usual).

We start with examples for 1., 2. and 3. from Deﬁnition 5.16:

Theorem 5.20 ([4]). Let Γ be a 3-regular scalar QFT Feynman graph. Then, the parametric
integrand of all Feynman graphs from quantum chromodynamics and the electroweak sector of the
Standard Model which are related to Γ via graph and cycle homology including all possible particle
type labelings allowed by the Standard Model Feynman rules (omitting fermions) ˜IF (Γ) can be
obtained via acting with the sum of the two Corolla diﬀerentials for quantum chromodynamics

and the electroweak sector of the Standard Model (cid:0)DQCD(Γ) + DEW(Γ)(cid:1) on the corresponding

parametric integrand I(Γ) of Γ18,

˜IF (Γ) =(cid:0)DQCD(Γ) + DEW(Γ)(cid:1) I(Γ) .

Proof. First note that the scalar particles h, ϕ± and ϕZ only couple to gauge bosons of the
electroweak sector of the Standard Model so that we are allowed to treat it separately from
quantum chromodynamics. The contribution for quantum chromodynamics via the action from
DQCD(Γ) on I(Γ) was already proven in Theorem 5.6. For the contribution of the electroweak
sector of the Standard Model notice that for a given graph Γ every edge that is not going to be
turned into a ghost edge is allowed to become a scalar edge (possibly with a restriction on the
edge labeling). This is precisely created by the power set of all edges of the graph Γ without the

edges that will be turned into ghost edges, i.e. ℘(cid:16)Γ[1] \Si

ghost loops. Moreover, the creation of 4-valent scalar vertices (2-scalar-2-gauge boson or 4-scalar
boson vertices) can be constructed via shrinking suitable internal scalar labeled edges between
two 3-valent vertices. Concrete, the requirements are having 2 or 4 scalar edge neighbors, i.e.
edges in the set PH/G. Furthermore, they are not allowed to share a vertex with an edge which
will be turned into a ghost edge (again, we remark that also edges which will be turned into
fermion edges are not allowed either, if included). And ﬁnally, also adjacent edges are not allowed

to shrink simultaneously. Therefore, ℘(4)(cid:16)PH/G(cid:17) consists of all sets of edges that are allowed

to shrink in the set PH/G in order to produce valid 4-valent scalar vertices. Furthermore, the
Feynman rules for the 3-valent 1-scalar-2-gauge boson and 2-scalar-1-gauge boson vertices are
created by the additional products of the Corolla polynomial for the electroweak sector of the
Standard Model (cf. Deﬁnition 5.19 compared to Deﬁnition 5.1). Moreover, since the original
Corolla polynomial acts only on the part(s) of Γ which will be turned into pure gauge boson
vertices or their corresponding ghosts, the 4-valent 4-gauge boson vertices are created just like
with the standard Corolla diﬀerential and can be received as the corresponding residues in the
shrinked edge Schwinger parameters, cf. Theorem 5.6. Additionally, the right symmetry factors
are obtained by the multiplication with the fraction sym(Γ)/ sym(L) and possible redundancies
are divided out by the factor iso(L). The corresponding particle masses are included via the
exponential term which also removes the Schwinger parameters for shrinked scalar labeled edges.

Finally all corresponding coupling constants for the labeling L ∈ L(cid:16)Γ, PH/G, P(4)(cid:17) are given in
coupling(cid:16)PH/G, P(4), L(cid:17).

6 Conclusion

The aim of this paper was to review the generalization of the Corolla polynomial deﬁned in [1, 2,
3] to the bosons of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model, which was ﬁrst worked out in [4].
Therefore all the relevant graph theoretic notions (cf. Section 3), the parametric representation
of scalar quantum ﬁeld theories (cf. Section 4) and the Corolla polynomial and diﬀerential for
pure Yang-Mills theory (cf. Subsection 5.1) were reviewed. The inclusion of the bosons of the
electroweak sector of the Standard Model was made possible in two steps. First by working out
the combinatorics of labeling a 3-regular scalar QFT Feynman graph with labels of the gauge

bosons of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model (cf. Subsection 5.2). Then secondly
by working out the additional tensor structures arising from the inclusion of the Feynman rules
for the scalar particles of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model (cf. Subsection 5.3).
We showed that at least for the gauge bosons of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model
the symmetry factors work out correct (cf. Corollary 5.14). Furthermore, a relatively compact
notation was given for the inclusion of the scalar particles of the Standard Model, compared to
the standard Standard Model Feynman rules (cf. Deﬁnition 5.19, Deﬁnition 5.4, Theorem 5.20,
[4, Appendix A] and [8]).

As projects for future work, several topics related to the Corolla polynomial are of particular
interest: First of all, although it is in principle clear [2], the combinatorics for the inclusion
of fermions to the Corolla polynomial for the electroweak sector of the Standard Model should
be explicitly worked out. Secondly, as we believe that this approach is useful for computer
calculations - since derivations can be done with much less computational aﬀord than integrations
- it would be useful to bring this approach on a computer. And thirdly, since it is believed that
the Corolla polynomial can also be generalized to the case of quantum gravity [2], it would be
interesting to see what we could learn from this approach and it’s underlying combinatorics.
