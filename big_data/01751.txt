Stability analysis and stabilization of stochastic linear

impulsive, switched and sampled-data systems

Abstract

Impulsive systems are a very ﬂexible class of systems that can be used to represent switched and sampled-data systems. We
propose to extend the previously obtained results on deterministic impulsive systems to the stochastic setting. The concepts
of mean-square stability and dwell-times are utilized in order to formulate relevant stability conditions for such systems.
These conditions are formulated as convex clock-dependent linear matrix inequality conditions that are applicable to robust
analysis and control design, and veriﬁable using discretization or sum of squares techniques. Stability conditions under various
dwell-time conditions are obtained and non-conservatively turned into state-feedback stabilization conditions. The results are
ﬁnally applied to the analysis and control of stochastic sampled-data systems. Several comparative examples demonstrate the
accuracy and the tractability of the approach.

Key words: Stochastic impulsive systems; stochastic sampled-data systems; dwell-times; clock-dependent conditions

1 Introduction

Impulsive systems [1, 2] arise in many applications such
as such as ecology [3, 4], epidemiology [5] and sampled-
data systems/control [6–8]. Lyapunov-based methods
and dwell-time notions can be used to establish various
stability concepts and conditions; see e.g. [8–11]. No-
tably, minimum dwell-time stability conditions for linear
impulsive systems have been obtained in [10] following
the ideas developed in [12] in the context of switched
systems. It is shown in [10] that despite a suﬃcient sta-
bility condition can be expressed as a tractable linear
matrix inequality problem, this type of conditions are
only applicable to linear time-invariant systems without
uncertainties and are impossible to convert into design
conditions, even in the simple case of state-feedback de-
sign [8, 10, 11]. These drawbacks motivated the consid-
eration of looped-functionals [10, 11, 13, 14], a particular
class of indeﬁnite functionals satisfying a certain bound-
ary condition, referred to as the looping-condition. These
functionals have the merit of leading to conditions that
are convex in the matrices of the system, hence easily
applicable to linear uncertain systems with time-varying
uncertainties and to nonlinear systems [15]. The price
to pay for these interesting properties is that the result-
ing conditions are inﬁnite-dimensional semideﬁnite pro-
grams, that may then be solved using discretization tech-
niques [16,17] or sum of squares programming [8,18]. Due

to the presence of additional inﬁnite-dimensional deci-
sion functions, the complexity of the conditions may not
scale very well with the dimension of the system and/or
the number of basis functions used to express inﬁnite-
dimensional variables. Moreover, looped-functionals are
limited to stability analysis and are diﬃcult to con-
sider for design purposes. To circumvent this prob-
lem, clock-dependent conditions have been considered
in [8, 14, 19, 20] where it is shown that these conditions
possess the same advantages than looped-functional con-
ditions (i.e. the possibility of considering nonlinear and
uncertain linear systems) together with the additional
possibility of using them for design purposes. Despite
these frameworks have been recently shown to be the-
oretically equivalent in [14], because the same accuracy
is attained with a lower computational cost, it is then
preferable to use clock-dependent stability conditions
rather than looped-functional-based ones.

We propose to address here the case of stochastic im-
pulsive systems where the continuous-time part consists
of a linear stochastic diﬀerential equation with state
multiplicative noise [21] and the discrete-time part is a
stochastic diﬀerence equation [22]. The impulses arrival
times are considered here as purely time-dependent and
deterministic. Stochastic hybrid systems have been ex-
tensively studied in the literature; see e.g. [23, 24] and
references therein. However, very few address the case
where both parts of the impulsive system are aﬀected
by noise [25, 26] and, when this is the case, average
dwell-time conditions, state-dependent impulse times or
stochastically arriving impulses [27, 28] are most of the
time only considered.

The main goal of the paper is therefore to develop sta-

bility conditions in the same spirit as in [8, 10, 14, 20]
where the deterministic case was considered. To this
aim, we consider the notion of dwell-times and obtain
a necessary and suﬃcient condition characterizing the
mean-square stability under constant dwell-time, and
suﬃcient conditions establishing the mean-square stabil-
ity in the ranged and minimum dwell-time cases. These
conditions, albeit stated in a more implicit way, natu-
rally generalize those obtained in the deterministic set-
ting as they reduce to the deterministic conditions when
the noise-related terms are set to zero. Due to the im-
plicit structure of the conditions, they cannot be checked
per se. In order to overcome this diﬃculty, and in the
same spirit as in [8, 14, 20], lifted versions of the con-
ditions expressed as clock-dependent linear matrix in-
equalities are considered. These conditions have the ben-
eﬁts of being convex in the matrices of the system, a
property that enables their use in the contexts of uncer-
tain systems and control design. Because these condi-
tions are inﬁnite-dimensional, they cannot be checked di-
rectly and need to be relaxed. Possible relaxation meth-
ods include the approximation of inﬁnite-dimensional
variables using a piecewise-linear approximation [16, 17]
or the use of sum of squares programming [8, 18]. It
is emphasized that these relaxed conditions are asymp-
totically exact in the sense that they can approximate
arbitrarily well the original conditions they have been
derived from. These conditions are shown to include
those of [29], which characterize the mean-square stabil-
ity stochastic linear switched systems, by exploiting the
possibility of representing switched systems as impul-
sive systems. The approach is then non-conservatively
extended to state-feedback design, for which convex con-
ditions are also obtained. Finally, the analysis and con-
trol of aperiodic stochastic sampled-data systems is per-
formed using the proposed method by reformulating the
considered sampled-data system into an impulsive sys-
tem. It is worth mentioning here that sampled-data sys-
tems driven by multiplicative noise do not seem to have
been thoroughly considered in the literature. This paper
therefore ﬁlls this gap by providing tractable conditions
for both the analysis and the control of such systems.
Various comparative examples demonstrate the accu-
racy and tractability of the approach.

Outline: The structure of the paper is as follows: in
Section 2 preliminary deﬁnitions and results are given.
Section 3 is devoted to dwell-time stability analysis while
Section 4 addresses dwell-time stabilization. Sampled-
data systems are ﬁnally treated in Section 5. Examples
are considered in the related sections.

2 Preliminaries

From now on, the following class of linear stochastic im-
pulsive system

c uc(t)]dt + Ecx(t)dW1(t)

+B2

c uc(t)dW2(t), t (cid:54)= tk

k ) = Jx(tk) + B1

dud(k) + Edx(tk)ν1(k)

+B2

dud(k)ν2(k), k ∈ N

(1)

x(0) = x0

is considered where x, x0 ∈ Rn, uc ∈ Rmc and ud ∈ Rmd
are the state of the system, the initial condition, the
continuous control input and the discrete control in-
put, respectively. The notation x(t+) is a shorthand for
lims↓t x(s), i.e. the trajectories are assumed to be left-
continuous. The sequence of impulse instants {tk}k∈N
is deﬁned such that Tk := tk+1 − tk ≥ Tmin for some
Tmin > 0. This then implies that {tk}k∈N0 , t0 = 0,
is increasing without bound. The processes W1(t) and
W2(t) are independent scalar Wiener processes; i.e. for
i = 1, 2, we have that Wi(0) = 0, Wi(t) is almost
surely everywhere continuous and has independent in-
crements Wi(t) − Wi(s), 0 ≤ s < t, that are normally
distributed with zero mean and variance t − s. The se-
quence {νi(k)}k∈N0, i = 1, 2, is sequence of independent
identically distributed random variables with zero mean
and unit variance that are independent of x(tk) for all
k ∈ N. Let (Ω,F, (Ft,k)t≥0,k∈N0 , P) be a complete proba-
bility space with σ-algebra F and natural (hybrid) ﬁltra-
tion Ft,k (for more details on hybrid ﬁltrations see [30]).
Let E[·] be the expectation operator with respect to P.
Deﬁnition 1 We say that the system (1) with ud, uc ≡ 0
is mean-square asymptotically stable if E[||x(t)||2
2] → 0
as t → ∞.
Lemma 2 Assume that 0 < Tmin < Tk < Tmax for
some Tmax > . Then, the system (1) with ud, uc ≡
0 is mean-square asymptotically stable if and only if
E[||x(t+
2] → 0 as k → ∞.
Proof :
It is clear that if the system is mean-square
asymptotically stable then E[||x(t+
2] → 0 as k → ∞.
To prove the converse, ﬁrst note that, when ud, uc ≡ 0,
dE[||x(t)||2
c Ec)x(t)] ≤ βE[||x(t)||2
= E[x(t)T (He[A]+ET
2]
2]
for all t ∈ (tk, tk+1) and for any large enough β > 0. This
2] ≤ eβTmaxE[||x(t+
k )||2
then implies that E[||x(tk + τ )||2
2],
2] → 0 as k → ∞,
which implies in turn that if E[||x(t+
2] → 0 as k → ∞. The
E[||x(tk + τ )||2
then supτ∈(0,Tk]
♦
proof is complete.

Notations: The cone of symmetric (positive deﬁnite)
matrices of dimension n is denoted by Sn (Sn(cid:31)0). The sets
of integers and whole numbers are denoted by N and
N0, respectively. Given a vector v, its 2-norm is deﬁned
as ||v||2 = (vT v)1/2. For a square matrix A, we deﬁne
He[A] := A + AT . The symbols ⊕ and ⊗ are used for
denoting the Kronecker sum and product, respectively.

The above result remains valid as long as the impulses
are persistent, i.e. Tk < ∞. In the case where the im-
pulses are not persistent (i.e. there exists a k∗ ∈ N0 such
that Tk < ∞ for k = 0, . . . , k∗ − 1 and Tk∗ = ∞), then
the asymptotic mean-square stability of (1) eventually
becomes equivalent to the asymptotic mean-square sta-
bility of the continuous-time part of (1). Note also that
this result remains valid when state-dependent control

inputs are considered (e.g. state-, output- and dynamic-
output feedback).
Remark 3 By considering the change of variables
z(t) = eαtx(t) and applying the above result to z(t),
we immediately immediately that E[||x(t)||2
2] exponen-
tially converges to 0 with rate 2α as t → ∞ if and
only if E[||x(t+
2] geometrically converges to 0 with rate

3 Mean-square stability of stochastic linear im-

pulsive systems

This section is devoted to the mean-square stability anal-
ysis of the system (1) with no input (i.e. uc ≡ 0 and
ud ≡ 0) under constant, ranged and minimum dwell-
time. Before stating the main results of this section, it
is convenient to introduce here the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 4 The
the
solution
continuous-time part of the system (1) with uc ≡ 0 and
ud ≡ 0 is deﬁned as Φ : R≥0 → Rn×n where

fundamental

of

dΦ(t) = AΦ(t)dt + EcΦ(t)dW1(t), t ≥ 0

(2)

where Φ(0) = I and W1(t) is deﬁned as in (1).
Note that for every t ≥ 0, Φ(t) is a random variable. This
fundamental solution therefore naturally generalizes the
deterministic one, which is readily retrieved by setting
Ec = 0. Associated with Φ(t), we deﬁne for any Z ∈
Rn×n the following quadratic expression

ΞZ(s) := Φ(s)T ZΦ(s), s ≥ 0.

(3)

With these deﬁnitions in mind, we can now move forward
to the main results of the section.

3.1 Constant dwell-time

Let us ﬁrst consider the case of constant dwell-time, that
is, the case where, for some ¯T > 0, we have that Tk = ¯T
for all k ∈ N0. We then have the following result:
Theorem 5 The following statements are equivalent:
(i) The system (1) with uc ≡ 0, ud ≡ 0 is mean-
square asymptotically stable under constant dwell-
time, that is, for any sequence of impulse times ver-
ifying Tk = ¯T , k ∈ N,

(ii) The matrix M( ¯T ) := exp(A ¯T )J deﬁned with

A := A ⊕ A + Ec ⊗ Ec and J := J ⊗ J + Ed ⊗ Ed

is Schur stable.

(iii) There exists a matrix P ∈ Sn(cid:31)0 such that

E[J T ΞP ( ¯T )J + ET

d ΞP ( ¯T )Ed] − P ≺ 0

(4)

(iv) There exists a matrix-valued function S : [0, ¯T ] →

holds where ΞP (·) is deﬁned in (3).
Sn, S(0) (cid:31) 0, such that the conditions
− ˙S(τ ) + AT S(τ ) + S(τ )A + ET

c S(τ )Ec (cid:22) 0 (5)

and

J T S( ¯T )J − S(0) + ET

d S( ¯T )Ed + ε I (cid:22) 0

(6)

(v) There exists a matrix-valued function S : [0, ¯T ] →

hold for all τ ∈ [0, ¯T ].
Sn, S( ¯T ) (cid:31) 0, such that the conditions

˙S(τ ) + AT S(τ ) + S(τ )A + ET

c S(τ )Ec (cid:22) 0

(7)

and

J T S(0)J − S( ¯T ) + ET

d S(0)Ed + ε I (cid:22) 0

(8)

hold for all τ ∈ [0, ¯T ].

k )T and x(t+
k+1)||2

Proof : Proof that (iii) ⇒ (i). The proof of this
implication follows from the fact that by pre- and
post-multiplying (4) by x(t+
k ), respec-
2,P ] − (1 −
tively, we immediately get that E[||x(t+
2,P ] ≤ 0 for some ε ∈ (0, 1) and where
ε)E[||x(t+
k )||2
||v||2
2,P := vT P v and for all k ∈ N0. This implies that
2,P ] → 0 as k → ∞, proving then the mean-
k )||2
E[||x(t+
square asymptotic (exponential) stability of the system
(invoking Lemma 2 and Remark 3).
Proof that (i) ⇒ (iii). The proof of this statement is
based on the explicit construction of a matrix P ∈ Sn(cid:31)0
that veriﬁes the condition (4) whenever the system (1) is
mean-square asymptotically (exponentially) stable. To
do this, let us deﬁne ﬁrst the following expression
c Q(t)Ec, t (cid:54)= tk

˙Q(t) = AT Q(t) + Q(t)A + ET

Q(t+

k ) = J T Q(tk)J + ET

d Q(tk)Ed, k ∈ N

(9)

with Q0 = Q(0) = Y for any Y ∈ Sn(cid:31)0. Note
that the mean-square exponential stability of the sys-
tem is equivalent to the exponential stability of the
(cid:80)∞
above matrix-valued linear diﬀerential equations since
0 Q(t)x0. Let us deﬁne P ∗ =
E[x(t)T Y x(t)] = xT
k=0 Qk (cid:31) 0, Qk := Q(t+
k ) (cid:23) 0, Q0 = Y (cid:31) 0. Note
that the latter sum is well-deﬁned because (9) is expo-
nentially stable and that

(cid:3) = Qk+1.

E(cid:2)J T ΞQk ( ¯T )J + ET

(10)
Substituting then P ∗ in place of P in (4) and using (10)
yield

d ΞQk ( ¯T )Ed

Qk = −Q0 = −Y ≺ 0

(11)

k=1

k=0

proves the result.
Proof that (i) ⇔ (ii). The mean-square asymptotic sta-
bility of (1) is equivalent to the asymptotic stability of
(9). Vectorizing this matrix diﬀerential equation yields
the system ˙z(t) = Az(t), t (cid:54)= tk, and z(t+
k ) = J z(tk),
k ∈ N. Since the impulses arrive periodically, then the

3

k+1) = exp(A ¯T )J z(t+

stability of this system is equivalent to the stability of
the discretized system z(t+
k ) and
the result follows.
Proof that (iv) ⇒ (iii). Integrating (5) with S(0) =
P , for simplicity, and using the deﬁnition of Φ, we get
that S(τ ) (cid:23) E[Φ(τ )T S(0)Φ(τ )]. Substituting then this
expression in (6) yields the condition (4). The proof is
complete.
Proof that (iii) ⇒ (iv). Assume that (4) holds and
deﬁne S∗(τ ) = E[Φ(τ )T S(0)Φ(τ )], S(0) = P . This gives
that − ˙S∗(τ ) + AT S∗(τ ) + S(τ )A∗ + ET
c S(τ )∗Ec = 0,
hence (5) holds. Substituting then the value S∗( ¯T ) in the
place of S( ¯T ) in (6) yields an expression that is identical
to (4). The condition (6) then readily follows.
Proof that (iv) ⇔ (v). The equivalence follows from
the change of variables S(τ ) ← S( ¯T − τ ).
♦

The conditions stated in the two last statements are re-
ferred to as clock-dependent conditions as they explicitly
depend on the time τ (the clock value) elapsed since the
last impulse. At each event, the clock is reset to 0 (i.e.
τ (t+
k ) = 0) and then grows continuously with slope 1
until the next impulse time. Clocks are extensively con-
sidered in the analysis of hybrid systems and timed au-
tomata; see e.g. [2, 31]. Clocks here are used to measure
the current dwell-time value and explicitly consider it in
the conditions.

It is interesting to note that when the system with-
out any control input is deterministic, i.e. Ec = 0 and
Ed = 0, then the conditions stated in the previous re-
sult reduce to those of [8], emphasizing then their higher
degree of generality. However, unlike in the determinis-
tic setting, the condition (4) is not directly tractable in
this form due to the presence of the expectation operator
and random matrices that are diﬃcult to compute. The
conditions of the other statements, although stated as
inﬁnite-dimensional LMI problems, can be turned into
ﬁnite-dimensional tractable conditions using several re-
laxation techniques. This will be discussed in more de-
tails in Section 3.4.

3.2 Ranged dwell-time

Let us consider now the ranged dwell-time case, that is,
the case where Tk ∈ [Tmin, Tmax], 0 < Tmin ≤ Tmax <
∞, for all k ∈ N0. We then have the following result:
Theorem 6 The following statements are equivalent:
(i) There exists a matrix P ∈ Sn(cid:31)0 such that
d ΞP (θ)Ed] − P ≺ 0

E[J T ΞP (θ)J + ET

(12)
holds for all θ ∈ [Tmin, Tmax] where ΞP (·) is deﬁned
in (3).
:
[0, Tmax] → Sn, S(0) (cid:31) 0, such that the conditions
− ˙S(τ ) + AT S(τ ) + S(τ )A + ET
c S(τ )Ec (cid:22) 0 (13)

(ii) There exists a matrix-valued function S

and

J T S(θ)J − S(0) + ET

d S(θ)Ed + ε I (cid:22) 0

(14)
hold for all τ ∈ [0, Tmax] and all θ ∈ [Tmin, Tmax].
Then, when one of the above equivalent statements
holds, the system (1) with uc ≡ 0 and ud ≡ 0 is
mean-square asymptotically stable with ranged dwell-
time (Tmin, Tmax), that is, for any sequence of impulse
times verifying Tk ∈ [Tmin, Tmax] for all k ∈ N.
Proof : The proof of this result follows from the same
♦
lines as the proof of Theorem 5.

3.3 Minimum dwell-time

We ﬁnally consider the minimum dwell-time case, that
is, Tk ≥ ¯T for all k ∈ N0. We then have the following
result:
Theorem 7 The following statements are equivalent:
(i) There exists a P ∈ Sn(cid:31)0 such that the LMIs
d ΞP (θ)Ed] − P ≺ 0

E[J T ΞP (θ)J + ET

(15)

and
hold for all θ ≥ ¯T where ΞP (·) is deﬁned in (3).

AT P + P A + ET

c P Ec ≺ 0

(ii) There exists a P ∈ Sn(cid:31)0 such that the LMIs
d ΞP ( ¯T )Ed] − P ≺ 0

E[J T ΞP ( ¯T )J + ET

(17)

(16)

AT P + P A + ET

and
(18)
hold where ΞP (·) is deﬁned in (3).
(iii) There exists a matrix-valued function S : R≥0 →
Sn, S( ¯T ) (cid:31) 0, S( ¯T + s) = S( ¯T ), s ≥ 0, such that
the conditions

c P Ec ≺ 0

AT S( ¯T ) + S( ¯T )A + ET

˙S(τ ) + AT S(τ ) + S(τ )A + ET

c S( ¯T )Ec ≺ 0,

(19)
c S(τ )Ec (cid:22) 0 (20)

and

J T S(0)J − S( ¯T ) + ET

d S(0)Ed + ε I (cid:22) 0

(21)

hold for all τ ∈ [0, ¯T ].

Then, when one of the above equivalent statements holds,
the system (1) with uc ≡ 0 and ud ≡ 0 is mean-square
asymptotically stable with minimum dwell-time ¯T , that
is, for any sequence of impulse times verifying Tk ≥ ¯T
for all k ∈ N.
Proof : The proof that (ii) is equivalent to (iii) follows
from Theorem 5. The proof that (i) implies (ii) is also
immediate. Let us then focus on the reverse implication.
Deﬁne ﬁrst the function f ¯T (θ) := E[Φ( ¯T + θ)T P Φ( ¯T +
θ)]. Then, we have that

df ¯T
dθ

= E[Φ( ¯T + θ)T [He[P A] + ET

c P Ec]Φ( ¯T + θ)]. (22)

4

Using now (18), we can conclude that df ¯T
θ ≥ 0. This, in turn, implies that

dθ (cid:22) 0 for all

E[J T ΞP ( ¯T + θ)J + ET

d ΞP ( ¯T + θ)Ed]

(cid:22) E[J T ΞP ( ¯T )J + ET

d ΞP ( ¯T )Ed]

(23)

for any suﬃciently small θ ≥ 0. Noting ﬁnally that the
above inequality also holds when substituting ¯T by ¯T +µ
for any µ ≥ 0 we get that
E[J T ΞP ( ¯T + θ(cid:48))J + ET

d ΞP ( ¯T + θ(cid:48))Ed]

(cid:22) E[J T ΞP ( ¯T )J + ET

d ΞP ( ¯T )Ed]

(24)

for all θ(cid:48) := θ + µ ≥ 0. Using ﬁnally (17) yields the
♦
result. The proof is complete.

3.4 Computational aspects

The conditions of the theorems stated in the previous
sections are inﬁnite-dimensional LMI feasibility prob-
lems which cannot be veriﬁed directly. In what follows,
we describe two relaxation methods turning the origi-
nal untractable conditions into tractable ones. Note that
even though we only provide these relaxations for The-
orem 5, (iv), similar ones can be obtained for the condi-
tions of Theorem 6 and Theorem 7.

3.4.1 Piecewise linear approach

The ﬁrst method, referred to as the piecewise linear ap-
proximation, proposes to impose a piecewise linear struc-
ture to the general matrix-valued functions involved in
the conditions; see e.g. [17]. The following result states
the conditions that approximate those of Theorem 5,
(iv):
Proposition 8 Let N ∈ N. The following statements
are equivalent:

(a) The conditions of Theorem 5, (iv) hold with the
piecewise-linear matrix-valued function S(τ ) given
by

S(τ ) =

(25)
for τ ∈ [i ¯T /N, (i + 1) ¯T /N ], Si ∈ Sn, i = 0, . . . , N −
1.
(b) There exist matrices Si ∈ Sn, i = 1, . . . , N , S0 (cid:31) 0,

¯T /N

+ Si

such that the LMIs

Si+1 − Si

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

τ − i ¯T
N

− Si+1 − Si

¯T /N

+ AT Si + SiA + ET

c SiEc (cid:22) 0 (26)

− Si+1 − Si

¯T /N

and

+ AT Si+1 + Si+1A + ET

c Si+1Ec (cid:22) 0
(27)

J T SN J − S0 + ET

d SN Ed + ε I (cid:22) 0

(28)

hold for all i = 0, . . . , N − 1.

5

When one of the above statements holds, then the con-
ditions of Theorem 5, (iv) hold with the computed
piecewise-linear matrix S(τ ).

Proof : The proof follows from a convexity argument.
By substituting the piecewise-linear expression of S(τ )
given by (25) into the conditions (6) and (5) gives (28)
and

− Si+1 − Si

¯T /N

+ He[S(τ )A] + ET

c S(τ )Ec (cid:22) 0,

(29)

respectively. Noting then that the above LMI is aﬃne
in τ , then for each i = 0, . . . , N − 1, it is necessary
and suﬃcient to check the above LMI at the vertices of
the interval [i ¯T /N, (i + 1) ¯T /N ], that is, at the values
i ¯T /N and (i + 1) ¯T /N . The equivalence follows from the
♦
losslessness of the manipulations.

As the conditions stated in the above result are ﬁnite-
dimensional, they can be solved using standard SDP
solvers such as SeDuMi [32]. Note, moreover, than using
similar arguments as in [33], we can prove that if the con-
ditions of Theorem 5, (iv) are feasible, then there exists
an integer N∗ such that the conditions of Proposition 8,
(b) are feasible for all N ≥ N∗ .

3.4.2 Sum of squares programs

Another possible relaxation relies on the use of sum of
squares programming [18, 34] where we impose that the
matrix-valued functions be polynomial functions. The
following result states conditions that approximate those
of Theorem 5, (iv) and that can be easily checked using
SOSTOOLS [34]:

Proposition 9 Let ε, ν, ¯T > 0 be given and assume that
the following sum of squares program

Find polynomial matrices S, Γ : R → Sn such that
S(0) − νIn (cid:23) 0

is feasible. Then the conditions of Theorem 5, (iv) hold
with the computed polynomial matrix S(τ ) and the system
(1) is mean-square asymptotically stable with constant
dwell-time ¯T .

Regarding the conservatism, it can be shown using the
same arguments as in [20] that if the conditions of The-
orem 5, (iv) are feasible, then there exists a suﬃciently
large integer d such that the above SOS program is fea-
sible for some polynomials S, Γ of degree at least 2d. Fi-
nally, it is important to stress that SOS conditions are
in general more tractable than those obtained using the
piecewise linear approximation that often require a large
discretization order; see [14, 20].

3.5 Application to switched systems

Interestingly, the results developed in this section also
applies to linear stochastic switched systems. To empha-
size this, let us consider the stochastic switched system

(35) for various values for κ and δ using Proposition 9 and
matrix polynomials S(τ ) and Γ(τ ) of degree 6.

where y, y0 ∈ Rn and W1(t) are the state of the sys-
tem, the initial condition and the standard Wiener pro-
cess, respectively. The switching signal σ : R≥0 →
{1, . . . , N}, for some ﬁnite N ∈ N, is piecewise constant
and describes the evolution of the mode of the switched
system. This system can be reformulated in the form (1)

for all i, j = 1, . . . , µ, i (cid:54)= j, where {ei}i=1,...,N is the
standard basis of RN . Note, however, that we have here
multiple jump maps Jij (actually reset maps here). It
is immediate to see that the derived stability conditions
can be straightforwardly extended to address this case,
and we get the following result adapted from Theorem 7:
Corollary 10 Assume that there exists a block-diagonal
i=1(Ri), Ri : [0, ¯T ] →
matrix-valued function R = diagN
Sn, R( ¯T ) (cid:31) 0, such that the conditions

and
(34)
hold for all τ ∈ [0, ¯T ] and for all i, j = 1, . . . , N , i (cid:54)= j.
Then, the linear stochastic switched system (30) is mean-
square asymptotically stable with minimum dwell-time
¯T .
Proof : The proof is based on the reformulation (1)-
(31). Noting then the system is block-diagonal, then it
is enough to choose a matrix-valued function R(τ ) that
is also block-diagonal. Substituting the model in the
conditions of Theorem 7 and expanding them yield the
♦
result.

It is interesting to note that the above condition, al-
though formulated in a more compact form, include
those obtained in [29]. If we indeed apply now the piece-
wise linear approximation, then we get exactly the con-
ditions of [29, Theorem 1].

d = 0 (i.e. no control input) for
some scalars κ, δ ≥ 0. We then choose several values for
the parameters δ and κ. The case (κ, δ) = (0, 0) corre-
sponds to the deterministic case of [8]. For each of these
values for the parameters, we solve the sum of squares
program of Proposition 9 for the constant dwell-time and
the minimum dwell-time cases with matrix polynomials
of degree 6. Note that to adapt Proposition 9 to the min-
imum dwell-time case, we simply have to add the con-
c S( ¯T )Ec ≺ 0 to the program.
straint He[AT S( ¯T )] + ET
The numerical results are gathered in Table 1 and Table 3
where we can see that the deterministic results are indeed
retrieved and that, as expected, stability deteriorates as
we increase the value of the parameters κ and δ. It is also
interesting to observe that, for this example, the results
for the constant and the minimum dwell-times are quite
close. Note that this is far from being a general rule.
In order to estimate the conservatism of the method, we
consider the criterion of statement (ii) of Theorem 5
and we ﬁnd the results summarized in Table 2 where we
can see that the proposed method is very accurate for
this system. This also implies that the estimates of the
minimum dwell-time are very accurate as well.

d = 0 (i.e. no control input) for
some scalars κ, δ ≥ 0. For δ = κ = 0, this system is
known (see [10]) to be stable with maximum dwell-time
Tmax ≈ 0.4620, i.e. for all Tk ≤ 0.4620. Using the ranged
dwell-time result with Tmin = 0.01, we get the results
the maximal value for Tmax using a variation of the SOS
program in Proposition 9 and a bisection approach. In
order to evaluate the conservatism, we compare these re-
sults with the maximum value for θ for which the LMIs
P (cid:31) 0 and M(θ)T PM(θ) − P ≺ 0 are feasible for all
θ ∈ [0.01, Tmax] (quadratic stability condition). Since
this problem is not directly solvable (note that sum of
squares methods do not apply because of the presence of
exponential terms), the interval [0.01, Tmax] is gridded
over 201 points and the LMIs are checked on these points
only. This leads to the results of Table 5 where we can
observe that slightly larger values for Tmax are found.
However, this is at the price of a much higher computa-
tional cost (see [14, 20]) and gridding imprecision. Note
also that the exponential conditions are only valid in the
time-invariant case, while the conditions of Theorem 6
are more ﬂexible and apply to systems aﬀected by time-
varying uncertainties/parameters.

4 Mean-square stabilization of stochastic linear

impulsive systems

We extend here the results obtained in the previous
section to address the stabilization problem by state-
feedback. We ﬁrst consider stabilization under ranged
dwell-time and then derive stabilization conditions un-
der minimum dwell-time.

4.1 Stabilization with ranged dwell-time

We consider in this section the following class of state-
feedback control law

uc(tk + τ ) = Kc(τ )x(tk + τ ), τ ∈ (0, Tk]

ud(k) = Kdx(tk)

(37)

where Tk ∈ [Tmin, Tmax], k ∈ N0. The continuous
matrix-valued function Kc : [0, Tmax] → Rmc×n and the
matrix Kd ∈ Rmd×n involved above are the gains of the
controller to be determined. We then have the following
result:

Theorem 13 The following statements are equivalent:

4.2 Stabilization with minimum dwell-time

Let us consider now the minimum dwell-time case. Since
the dwell-time can be arbitrarily large in this setting, we
propose to use the following state-feedback control law

uc(tk + τ ) =

Kc(τ )x(tk + τ ), τ ∈ (0, ¯T ]
Kc( ¯T )x(tk + τ ), τ ∈ ( ¯T , Tk]

(45)

where Kc : [0, ¯T ] → Rmc×n and Kd ∈ Rmd×n are the
gains of the controllers that have to be determined. We
then have the following result:

tems

As an application example, we utilize the ranged dwell-
time result in order to derive a stabilization condition for
linear aperiodic stochastic sampled-data systems repre-
sented in the impulsive form:

hold for all τ ∈ [0, Tmax] and all θ ∈ [Tmin, Tmax].
Moreover, when one of the above statements holds, then
the (closed-loop) sampled-data system (54) is mean-
square asymptotically stable under ranged dwell-time
Tk ∈ [Tmin, Tmax] and a suitable controller gain can be
computed from the expression Kd = Ud ˜S(0)−1.
We now illustrate the above result by a simple example:

picted in Figure 2 where we can see that the controller is
able to make the closed-loop system mean-square asymp-
totically stable.

6 Conclusion

Dwell-time stability and stabilization conditions have
been obtained for stochastic impulsive systems and
expressed as inﬁnite-dimensional LMI problems that
can be solved using discretization or sum of squares
techniques. The approach has been shown to include
switched systems and sampled-data systems as particu-
lar cases, making then the approach quite general.

Possible future works include the design of dynamic out-
put feedback controllers, observer and ﬁlters. The ap-
proach can also be extended to performance characteri-
zation using induced-norms such as the induced L2-norm
and the induced L2-L∞-norm.
