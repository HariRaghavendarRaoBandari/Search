tions made with ESO telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under programme IDs 266.D-5655(A) and 084.D-0912(A); based on

ABSTRACT

We investigate the feasibility of the Si I infrared (IR) lines as Si abundance indicators for giant
stars. We ﬁnd that Si abundances obtained from the Si I IR lines based on the local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) analysis show large line-to-line scatter (mean value of 0.13 dex), and are higher
than those from the optical lines. However, when the non-LTE eﬀects are taken into account, the
line-to-line scatter reduces signiﬁcantly (mean value of 0.06 dex), and the Si abundances are consistent
with those from the optical lines. The typical average non-LTE correction of [Si/Fe] for our sample
stars is about −0.35 dex. Our results demonstrate that the Si I IR lines could be reliable abundance
indicators provided that the non-LTE eﬀects are properly taken into account.

1. INTRODUCTION

Chemical composition of stellar photospheres is a very
important tool to investigate the origins of elements as
well as the chemical evolution of the galaxies. During
the past decades, stellar abundances1 are mainly deter-
mined from optical spectra due to both historical and
technical reasons. Though visible light can easily pen-
etrate the atmosphere of the earth, they are subject to
the obscuring of interstellar dust and gas. This makes
it diﬃcult to utilize the optical spectra to investigate
the chemical abundances of stars suﬀering heavy inter-

stellar extinction, such as stars in the inner Galactic
disk and in the Galactic bulge. In this regard, infrared
(IR) spectroscopy is more promising as they are much
less aﬀected by the interstellar extinction. The ongo-
ing Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Ex-
periment (APOGEE; Majewski et al. 2015) is such an
attempt to use high-resolution and high signal-to-noise
(S/N) ratio IR spectroscopy to penetrate the dust that
obscures signiﬁcant fractions of the disk and bulge of
the Galaxy. Furthermore, IR spectroscopy could even
be used to investigate the chemical abundances of stars
beyond our Galaxy. Owning to their large luminosities
and peak ﬂux in the IR, red supergiant (RSG) stars are
ideal tracers of the chemical abundances of the exter-
nal galaxies out to large distances (Patrick et al. 2015).
This has been veriﬁed by chemical abundance analysis of

2

RSG stars in the Magellanic Clouds (Davies et al. 2015),
in NGC 6822 (Patrick et al. 2015), and in the Sculptor
Galaxy (Gazak et al. 2015) using the medium-resolution
(R ∼ 3000–8000) spectra in the J-band obtained by X-
shooter (Vernet et al. 2011) and K-band Multi-Object
Spectrograph (KMOS; Sharples et al. 2013) mounted on
the Very Large Telescope. Evans et al. (2011) showed
by simulation that, with future instruments, quantita-
tive IR spectroscopy could even be performed for RSG
stars to tens of Mpc. Due to the aforementioned ad-
vantages, IR spectroscopy will play a more important
role in chemical abundance analysis with existing and
forthcoming IR instruments (such as Keck/MOSFIRE,
VLT/KMOS, TMT/IRMS, E-ELT/EAGLE, etc.).

In addition to the advantages mentioned above, some-
times IR lines could be better abundance indicators
than optical
lines. This is the case for silicon (Si)
in very metal-poor stars. Si
is attributed as an α-
element, which is made during oxygen and neon burn-
ing in massive stars, and later ejected to the interstel-
lar medium by Type II supernovae (SNe) according to
Woosley & Weaver (1995). SNe Ia may also produce
some Si as suggested by Tsujimoto et al. (1995). There-
fore, Si abundances in metal-poor stars could be used
to test the SNe and Galactic chemical evolution mod-
els. Unfortunately, the optical Si I lines are very weak
in very metal-poor stars, so the two strong lines at 3905
and 4102 ˚A in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) are usually
employed to derive Si abundances. However, both of
these two lines have defects in abundance determina-
tions. The Si I 3905 ˚A line is blended by a CH line.
Though this CH feature may be weak in dwarf stars
with relatively high temperature (Cohen et al. 2004), it
could be very strong in cool giant stars (Cayrel et al.
2004). The Si I 4102 ˚A line falls in the wing of the Hδ
line, which makes it not easy to derive accurate Si abun-
dance. In such a situation, the Si I IR lines could be a
better alternative to derive Si abundances. There are
tens of Si I IR lines that are much stronger than the
optical lines and they suﬀer much less from the prob-
lem of blending or continuum normalization compared
to the 3905/4102 ˚A lines. For example, J¨onsson et al.
(2011) determined Si abundances for ten metal-poor gi-
ant stars using three Si I IR lines at 10371, 10844, and
10883 ˚A. However, their analysis was under the assump-
tion of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) as there
was no calculation for the non-LTE eﬀects of the Si I IR
lines at that time. Later, Shi et al. (2012) investigated
the non-LTE eﬀects of the Si I IR lines in nearby stars
(most of which were dwarf stars), and found that the
non-LTE eﬀects are important even for metal-rich stars
(> 0.1 dex). Bergemann et al. (2013) presented theoret-
ical calculations for the non-LTE eﬀects of four Si I lines
in the J-band for RSG stars. Their results show that the

non-LTE abundance correction varies smoothly between
−0.4 and −0.1 dex for stars with eﬀective temperature
between 3400 and 4400 K.

(2012)

Considering that Shi et al.

concentrated
mainly on main-sequence stars, while Bergemann et al.
(2013) focused on the theoretical non-LTE eﬀects, we de-
cided to make a practical investigation on the non-LTE
eﬀects of 16 Si I IR lines in giant stars based on ob-
servational spectra. In particular, the atomic data and
model atom of Shi et al. (2012) were calibrated by re-
quiring that consistent Si abundances could be obtained
from diﬀerent Si I IR lines as well as from the optical
lines for the sun, and it is necessary to check whether
these still hold true for giant stars.
In the next sec-
tion, we brieﬂy describe the observational data used in
this work. Section 3 presents our method of non-LTE
calculations and the test of its validity for giants. In Sec-
tion 4, we apply our method to a sample of metal-poor
giant stars and compare our results with the theoretical
chemical evolution models of Si. In the last section we
brieﬂy summarize our results and conclusions.

2. OBSERVATIONAL DATA

The sample analyzed in this work comprises 16
metal-poor giant program stars as
shown in Ta-
ble 1.
These stars were originally observed by
Takeda & Takada-Hidai (2011, 2012) in 2009 and 2011
for the purpose of determining sulfur (S) abundances
using the S I IR triplet lines. The spectra were
obtained using the IR Camera and Spectrograph
(IRCS; Kobayashi et al. 2000) in combination with the
188-element curvature-based adaptive optics system
(AO188) mounted on the Subaru Telescope. With a
resolution of about 20,000, the spectra cover a wave-
length range of 1.01–1.19 µm, including several Si I lines
that are not (severely) blended. For most of the stars,
the S/N ratios of the spectra are higher than 100. The
spectra were reduced following the standard procedure
using the “echelle” package of IRAF2. For more details
about the observation and data reduction, please refer
to Takeda & Takada-Hidai (2011, 2012).

As mentioned in the introduction, one of our aims is
to check whether we could obtain consistent Si abun-
dances from the IR and the optical lines in giant stars.
Unfortunately, the optical Si I lines are too weak to give
very accurate abundances for our sample stars. So we in-
cluded another two giant stars (Arcturus and HD 83240)
as benchmark stars. The optical Si I lines in these
two stars are stronger compared to the 16 sample stars,

which permits us to check whether abundances from
the optical and the IR lines are in reasonable agree-
ment. Besides, these two stars have archival IR spectra
of very high quality, based on which we could obtain
very accurate Si abundances to investigate whether dif-
ferent IR lines produce consistent results. For Arcturus,
the optical spectra was adopted from the Visible and
Near IR Atlas of the Arcturus Spectrum 3727–9300 ˚A
by Hinkle et al. (2000), and the IR spectra was adopted
from the IR Atlas of the Arcturus Spectrum, 0.9–5.3
microns by Hinkle et al. (1995). The typical spectral
resolution of the optical and IR spectra of Arcturus is
150,000 and 100,000, respectively. For HD 83240, the
optical spectra was adopted from the UVES-POP li-
brary (Bagnulo et al. 2003), and the IR spectra was
adopted from the CRIRES-POP library (Lebzelter et al.

2012). The typical spectral resolution of the optical and
the IR spectra of HD 83240 is 80,000 and 96,000, respec-
tively.

3. METHOD OF NON-LTE CALCULATIONS AND

VALIDITY TEST

3.1. Method of non-LTE calculations

In this work, we used the same method of non-LTE
calculations as Shi et al. (2008, 2009, 2011, 2012). Here,
we only give a brief description of the method. The
key of non-LTE calculations is the atomic model. The
Si atomic model adopted here includes 132 terms of
Si I, 41 terms of Si II, and the ground state of Si III.
In addition to the radiative bound–bound and bound–
free transitions, excitation and ionization induced by
inelastic collisions with electrons and hydrogen atoms

were also taken into account. The atomic data of
the spectral
lines used for Si abundance determina-
tion are given in Table 2. The data were adopted
from Shi et al. (2008), where the van der Waals damp-
ing constants were computed according to the inter-
polation tables of Anstee & O’Mara (1991, 1995), and
the oscillator strengths were derived by requiring the
solar Si abundance log(NSi/NH) + 12 to be 7.5. As
for the stellar model atmosphere, we used the revised
version of the opacity sampling model MAFAGS-OS
(Grupp 2004; Grupp et al. 2009), which is under the
one-dimensional (1D) and LTE assumption. The cou-
pled radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium equa-
tions were solved with a revised version of the DETAIL
program (Butler & Giddings 1985). Chemical abun-
dances were derived by spectrum synthesis using the
IDL/FORTRAN-based software package Spectrum In-
vestigation Utility (SIU) developed by Dr. J. Reetz.
SIU is an advanced software package which could per-
form spectrum displaying, continuum normalization, ra-
dial velocity correlation/correction, spectrum synthesis
(in LTE or non-LTE based on the 1D-LTE model at-

mosphere MAFAGS-OS mentioned above), etc., inter-
actively. All the input parameters, such as abundance
for each element, macroturbulence, rotation, and instru-
ment broadening, could be adjusted interactively, and
the synthetic spectrum could be displayed on screen in
real time.
In most cases, the external broadening of
line proﬁles caused by macroturbulence, rotation, and
instrument could be approximated using a simple Gaus-
sian function.

3.2. Validity test for giants with benchmark stars

The above method of non-LTE calculations has been
proved to be applicable for dwarf stars by Shi et al.
(2012).
In this section we will test whether it is also
valid for giant stars.

3.2.1. Stellar parameters and uncertainties

For Arcturus, we adopted the stellar parameters
(Teﬀ = 4281 K, log g = 1.72,
[Fe/H] = −0.55, ξ =
1.5 km s−1) from Takeda & Takada-Hidai (2011). They
were determined by Takeda et al. (2009) in a full spec-
troscopic way, i.e., Teﬀ from excitation equilibrium of

Fe I, log g from ionization equilibrium between Fe I
and Fe II, [Fe/H] from Fe I, and ξ from abundance-
independence of equivalent width (EW). We noticed
that Ram´ırez & Allende Prieto (2011) also investigated
the stellar parameters and abundances of Arcturus us-
ing high-quality data and methods that minimize model
uncertainties. They determined the eﬀective tempera-
ture using model atmosphere ﬁts to the observed spec-
tral energy distribution from the blue to the mid-IR,
and the surface gravity using the trigonometric parallax.
Their stellar parameters (Teﬀ = 4286 ± 30 K, log g =
1.66 ± 0.05, [Fe/H] = −0.52 ± 0.04, ξ = 1.74 km s−1)
are in excellent agreement with those adopted in this
work. Recently, Heiter et al. (2015) presented funda-
mental determinations of Teﬀ and log g for 34 Gaia FGK
benchmark stars. Their determinations were based on
the angular diameters, bolometric ﬂuxes, distances, and
masses, which are independent of spectroscopy and at-
mospheric models. They gave a Teﬀ of 4286 ±35 K and a
log g of 1.64 ± 0.09 for Arcturus. And the [Fe/H] of this
star was determined to be −0.52 ± 0.08 (after correction
for non-LTE eﬀects) in another work (Jofr´e et al. 2014)
in the Gaia FGK benchmark stars series. These values
agree well with the two sets of stellar parameters men-
tioned above, and the oﬀsets between diﬀerent studies
are well within the typical uncertainties of stellar param-
eters (∆Teﬀ = 20 K, ∆ log g = 0.08, ∆[Fe/H] = 0.07,
and ∆ξ = 0.25 km s−1) given by Takeda et al. (2009).
Actually, our calculations show that such diﬀerences in
stellar parameters had a very small eﬀect on the Si abun-
dance (∆[Si/Fe] ∼ 0.04 dex).

For HD 83240, we adopted the stellar parameters
(Teﬀ = 4682 K, log g = 2.45,
[Fe/H] = −0.02, ξ =
1.3 km s−1) from Mishenina et al. (2006). The eﬀective
temperature was determined with very high accuracy
(σ = 10–15 K) using the line depth ratios of several
iron-peak elements (such as Si, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, and Ni).
The surface gravity was derived using two methods, i.e.,
iron ionization equilibrium and wing ﬁtting of the Ca I
6162 ˚A line, and both methods give the same result. The
metallicity was determined from Fe I lines. We note
that according to the investigation of Lind et al. (2012),
non-LTE eﬀects of Fe I are negligible for cool (Teﬀ <
5000 K) stars with solar metallicity ([Fe/H] ∼ 0), such as
HD 83240. The microturbulent velocity was calculated
so that iron abundances do not depend on the EWs.
Da Silva et al. (2011) gave diﬀerent stellar parameters
for HD 83240 (Teﬀ = 4801 ± 89 K, log g = 2.83 ± 0.23,
[Fe/H] = −0.03 ± 0.08, ξ = 1.26 ± 0.09 km s−1) based
on the traditional spectroscopic method, i.e., excitation
equilibrium of Fe I and ionization equilibrium between
Fe I and Fe II. Their eﬀective temperature is marginally
consistent with that of Mishenina et al. (2006) consid-
ering the uncertainty, but their surface gravity shows

validity test because diﬀerence in Si abundances deter-
mined using the above two sets of stellar parameters is
only 0.03 dex.

With the stellar parameters we could calculate the
level populations in statistical equilibrium. Figure 1
shows the departure coeﬃcients bi = nnon-LTE
for
the populations of the seven Si I levels that produce the
IR transitions used to determine Si abundances in this
work for the two benchmark stars. The red lines repre-
sent the lower levels, while the blue lines are the upper
levels. It can be seen that, within log τ5000 = −3 . . . −2,
where the Si I IR lines are formed, the departure coef-
ﬁcients of the lower levels (denoted with bi) are higher
than those of the upper levels (denoted with bj). This
means that the line source function Sij is smaller than
the local Planck function Bν (T ) because Sij /Bν(T ) ∼
bj/bi < 1. As a result, the Si I IR lines are stronger in
non-LTE than in LTE, and hence the non-LTE abun-
dance corrections should be negative.

In combination with the calculated populations for the
individual levels, Si abundances were then derived by
spectrum synthesis of the individual Si I lines. We note
here that, due to the enhanced absorption in the line
cores in non-LTE, some of the Si I IR lines are so strong

(EW & 150 m˚A) that their observed line proﬁles could
only be reproduced in non-LTE. As an example, Figure 2
shows the spectrum synthesis of the strongest Si I IR
line (10827 ˚A with a EW of 318.3 m˚A) in Arcturus. The
solid line shows the best ﬁt to the observed line proﬁle
in non-LTE with a [Si/Fe] of 0.28 dex. The dotted line
is produced with the same [Si/Fe] but in LTE, which
is much weaker in the core of the line. No matter how
we adjusted the Si abundance, the observed line proﬁle
cannot be reproduced in LTE. In this case, the LTE
abundance was derived by simply increasing the [Si/Fe]
until the observed EW was reproduced. This led to a
[Si/Fe] of 0.68 dex, for which the line proﬁle is shown in
dash-dotted line in Figure 2.
It can be seen that the
core of the line is still much shallower, while the wing is
obviously deeper compared to the observed spectra.

Table 3 gives [Si/Fe] determined from the individual
optical and IR lines for the two benchmark stars. EWs
for the individual lines are also given. As can be seen
in Table 3, for both Arcturus and HD 83240, the optical
lines are insensitive to the non-LTE eﬀects. This is be-
cause these lines are mainly formed in the inner regions
of the photospheres (log τ5000 > −2), where the physical
conditions are close to LTE. However, as we mentioned
above, the regions of line formation for the IR lines are
shifted outward to log τ5000 = −3 . . . −2, where the line
source function diﬀers from the local Planck function,
and thus the non-LTE eﬀects cannot be neglected. Fig-
ure 3 shows the non-LTE correction of [Si/Fe] for the
individual Si I IR lines as a function of EW and EP for
the two benchmark stars. It can be seen that the non-
LTE abundance correction varies between ∼ −0.5 dex
and ∼ −0.05 dex. Though the non-LTE abundance cor-
rection seems to be independent of EP, it is correlated
with the EW of the line. In general, stronger lines show
larger non-LTE eﬀects, while weaker lines show smaller
non-LTE eﬀects. Figure 4 shows the [Si/Fe] derived from
the individual Si I IR lines as a function of EW and EP

for the two benchmark stars. It is obvious that for both
Arcturus and HD 83240, the LTE Si abundances from
the IR lines show large line-to-line scatter, but when
the non-LTE eﬀects are taken into account, the scatter
reduces signiﬁcantly. Moreover, the average non-LTE
Si abundances from the IR lines agree well with those
from the optical lines, whereas the LTE results are sig-
niﬁcantly higher.
In a word, our method of non-LTE
calculations produces consistent Si abundances from the
optical and the IR lines for the two benchmark stars.

We were aware that the two benchmark stars we se-
lected are relatively metal-rich, and it is diﬃcult to jus-
tify that our method works also for very metal-poor
stars. Unfortunately, in the publicly available archival
database, we were not able to ﬁnd any very metal-poor
giant star with high-quality IR spectra in the wavelength
range studied in this work. However,
in a previous
study, Shi et al. (2012) investigated Si abundances for
a well-studied very metal-poor giant HD 122563 based

on the IR spectra of medium quality (R ∼ 20, 000,
S/N ∼ 100). The stellar parameters they adopted
(Teﬀ = 4600 K, log g = 1.5, [Fe/H] = −2.53) are in rea-
sonable agreement with the fundamental determinations
(Teﬀ = 4587±60 K, log g = 1.61±0.07, [Fe/H] = −2.64±
0.22) of Heiter et al. (2015). The Si abundance deter-
mined from the IR spectra ([Si/Fe]non-LTE = 0.20 ±0.01)
agrees well with that from the 3905 and 4102 ˚A lines
([Si/Fe]non-LTE = 0.22 ± 0.05). Moreover, Jofr´e et al.
(2015) determined Si abundance for HD 122563 using
ﬁve optical lines3 by spectrum synthesis. They adopted
the stellar parameters from Heiter et al. (2015), and
their Si abundance ([Si/Fe]non-LTE = 0.28 ± 0.09) is con-
sistent with those from Shi et al. (2012). Since we used
exactly the same method as Shi et al. (2012), it is fair

7 m˚A according to Jofr´e et al. (2015).

to say that our method works also for very metal-poor
giant stars.

4. APPLICATION TO METAL-POOR GIANT

STARS

In this section, we applied the above method of non-
LTE calculations to a sample of 16 metal-poor giant
stars.

4.1. Stellar parameters and uncertainties

The narrow wavelength range of our IR spectra pre-
vented us from determining stellar parameters for the
sample stars by ourselves. So we adopted the stellar
parameters from Takeda & Takada-Hidai (2011, 2012),
which were taken from nine published studies4 (see Ta-
ble 1 for details). Among these studies, diﬀerent meth-
ods have been employed to determine stellar parame-
ters. For example, some studies derive Teﬀ based on
spectroscopic method (Fulbright 2000; Simmerer et al.
2004; Hansen & Primas 2011), while the others are
based on photometric calibrations; some studies deter-
mine log g using the parallaxes (Simmerer et al. 2004;
Takada-Hidai et al. 2005; Saito et al. 2009), while the
others utilize the ionization equilibrium between Fe I
and Fe II. Therefore, it is not surprising that diﬀer-
ences in stellar parameters exist between diﬀerent stud-
ies. Even with the same method, the adoption of dif-
ferent calibrations or line lists by diﬀerent studies may
lead to diﬀerent results (see the comparison of stellar
parameters from diﬀerent methods for the FGK stars
in the Gaia-ESO survey by Smiljanic et al. 2014).
In
the nine studies where we took the stellar parameters,
12 out of 16 sample stars have multiple independent
measurements of stellar parameters. We found that, for
some stars, the uncertainties of stellar parameters given
by the original studies cannot interpret the large dif-
ferences between diﬀerent studies. Therefore, for these
12 stars, we took the standard deviations of stellar pa-
rameters between diﬀerent studies as the uncertainties,
which are given in columns 7–10 of Table 1. For the rest
four stars (BD +23◦3130, HD 13979, HD 195636, and
HE 1523−0901) with only single measurement of stel-
lar parameters, the median value of the errors of the
above 12 stars was adopted.

4.2. Si abundances and uncertainties

Si abundances of the sample stars were derived by
spectrum synthesis of the individual Si I IR lines. Fig-
ure 5 shows the spectrum synthesis of the strong Si I
10585 ˚A line for two program stars HD 126587 and

spectra; the lines are the synthetic spectra in non-LTE with
diﬀerent [Si/Fe] (see the legend for details).

HD 166161. HD 126587 is the most metal-poor star in
our sample, while HD 166161 has the highest eﬀective
temperature and surface gravity. It can be seen that,
for both of these two stars, the Si I 10585 ˚A lines are
strong enough (EW > 60 m˚A) to be used to determine
Si abundances. Table 4 gives [Si/Fe] determined from
the individual Si I IR lines for the sample stars. EW for
each line is also given.

We were aware that stellar parameters for the sam-
ple stars were adopted from diﬀerent studies, and the
eﬀect of inhomogeneous stellar parameters on Si abun-
dances needs to be properly estimated. To do this, for
the 12 stars with multiple determinations of stellar pa-
rameters, we calculated Si abundances from diﬀerent
stellar parameters, and took the standard deviations as
the uncertainties of Si abundances caused by stellar pa-
rameters. For the rest four stars with only single mea-
surement of stellar parameters, the median value of the
errors (0.12 dex) of the above 12 stars was adopted as
the uncertainties caused by stellar parameters. The to-
tal errors of [Si/Fe] were then calculated by adding the
line-to-line scatters and the errors introduced by stel-
lar parameters in quadrature. Table 5 gives the average
[Si/Fe] from the Si I IR lines as well as the associated
uncertainties for all the stars investigated in this work.

4.3. Non-LTE eﬀects of the Si I IR lines

4 It is impossible to ﬁnd independent measurements of stellar

parameters for all the sample stars in any single study.

Figure 6 shows the non-LTE correction of [Si/Fe] for
the individual Si I IR lines as a function of EW for the

the EWs; the second and the third row are the LTE and the non-LTE [Si/Fe], respectively.

poor giant stars. The diamonds and the circles are the LTE
and the non-LTE results, respectively.

dance corrections show linear correlations with the line
strengths for all the stars with similar slopes. But the
intercepts of the linear relationships are not necessarily
the same; they are dependent on the stellar parame-
ters, especially the surface gravity (see the discussions
below). We also explored the dependency of the non-
LTE eﬀects on the stellar parameters, and the results
are plotted in Figure 7. It can be seen that, the non-
LTE abundance corrections are all negative within the
range of stellar parameters investigated. Moreover, the
non-LTE abundance corrections are more sensitive to
surface gravity than eﬀective temperature and metal-
licity. Stars with lower surface gravity show larger non-
LTE eﬀects, while stars with higher gravity show smaller
non-LTE eﬀects. Figure 8 shows the line-to-line scatter
of [Si/Fe] for the sample stars. It can be seen that, for a
given star, the LTE Si abundances show relatively large
line-to-line scatter. However, when the non-LTE eﬀects
are considered, the scatter reduces signiﬁcantly, though
for some stars they are still relatively large compared to
the benchmark stars. This should be partly due to the
quality of the spectra (lower resolution and lower S/N
compared to the spectra of the benchmark stars) used
for abundance determination. Figure 9 shows [Si/Fe] as
a function of eﬀective temperature and surface gravity.
The results from Shi et al. (2012) which are based on
the same IR lines and the same method are also plot-
ted. It can be seen that [Si/Fe] derived from the Si I IR
lines based on the non-LTE analysis is independent of
Teﬀ and log g.

sample stars. It can be seen that, the non-LTE eﬀects
are signiﬁcant for all the stars. Besides, the non-LTE
abundance corrections diﬀer from line to line; in gen-
eral, stronger lines show larger non-LTE eﬀects (up to
∼ 0.8 dex), while weaker lines show smaller non-LTE ef-
fects (as low as ∼ 0.1 dex). Overall, the non-LTE abun-

Shi et al. (2012) investigated the non-LTE eﬀects of
the Si I IR lines for 15 nearby stars. Their sample
are mostly dwarf stars, and there is only one giant star
(HD 122563), for which the average non-LTE correction
of [Si/Fe] is −0.26 dex. This is consistent with the re-
sults of our sample stars with similar stellar parameters.

plotted as circles; the results from Shi et al. (2012) are plot-

LTE and the non-LTE abundances, respectively. The results
for the two benchmark stars are marked with squares.

168 stars (−3 < [Fe/H] < 0) using 12 Si I lines be-
tween 5600 and 7100 ˚A. Their results showed a decreas-
ing trend of [Si/Fe] with increasing [Fe/H]. Cayrel et al.
(2004) performed abundance analysis for 35 very metal-
poor stars. Their Si abundances were derived in LTE
using the Si I 4102 ˚A line. The results indicated a
slightly increasing trend of [Si/Fe] from [Fe/H] ∼ −4
to [Fe/H] ∼ −2. Shi et al. (2009, 2011) determined Si
abundances in non-LTE for 79 stars based on 11 Si I
lines between 3900 and 6300 ˚A as well as two Si II lines
(6347/6371 ˚A). Their results suggested a ﬂat trend of
[Si/Fe] from [Fe/H] ∼ −3 to [Fe/H] ∼ −1, and then
a decreasing trend above [Fe/H] ∼ −1. The trend be-
tween [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H] derived in this work is shown in
Figure 10. The results from Shi et al. (2012) which are
obtained using the same IR lines and the same method
are also plotted. All the stars in our sample are giants,
while most of the stars from Shi et al. (2012) are dwarfs
(only one giant). It can be seen that there is no diﬀer-
ence in [Si/Fe] between giants and dwarfs in the common
metallicity range. As shown in Figure 10, combination
of our results with those from Shi et al. (2012) suggests
that [Si/Fe] decreases with increasing [Fe/H] in general,
though there seems to be a bump around [Fe/H] ∼ −1.
There are several Galactic chemical evolution mod-
els referring to Si in the literature (Timmes et al. 1995;
Samland 1998; Kobayashi et al. 2011; etc.). The chem-
ical evolution calculation of Timmes et al. (1995) pre-
dicted that [Si/Fe] increases with [Fe/H] from [Fe/H] ∼
−3 to [Fe/H] ∼ −2, and then decreases with [Fe/H] un-
til [Fe/H] ∼ −0.8. Samland (1998) predicted a constant
ratio of [Si/Fe] in the early Galaxy and then a decreas-
ing trend with increasing [Fe/H] due to the contribution
of SNe Ia. Kobayashi et al. (2011) presented the evo-
lution of elements (from C to Zn) using chemical evo-
lution models with updated yields of asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars and core-collapse SNe. Their results

Bergemann et al. (2013) calculated the non-LTE ef-
fects of four Si I IR lines for RSG stars with eﬀective
temperature between 3400 and 4400 K. Unfortunately,
we are not able to compare our results directly with
those of Bergemann et al. (2013) because the Si I IR
lines they investigated are diﬀerent from those this work.
Nevertheless, their results also show negative non-LTE
abundance correction, though the magnitude of correc-
tion (−0.4 . . . −0.1 dex) is lower than our results. This
should be mainly due to that Bergemann et al. (2013)
adopted stronger inelastic collisions with neutral hydro-
gen, which leads to smaller non-LTE eﬀects.

4.5. Implications for the chemical evolution of Si

As we mentioned in the introduction, Si abundances
could be used to test the SNe and Galactic chemical
evolution models. Several previous studies on stellar
abundances have investigated the relationship between
[Si/Fe] and [Fe/H] (Fulbright 2000; Cayrel et al. 2004;
Shi et al. 2009; etc.). While it is generally accepted
that [Si/Fe] decreases with [Fe/H] from [Fe/H] ∼ −1 to
[Fe/H] ∼ 0, the behavior of [Si/Fe] below [Fe/H] ∼ −1
is still controversial. One reason for this is the signif-
icant scatter of [Si/Fe] (ranging from −0.2 to 0.9 dex;
see Figure 1 of Shi et al. 2009) below [Fe/H] ∼ −1. The
dispersion could be due to either the cosmic scatter or
the uncertainties in abundance determinations or both.
Fulbright (2000) determined Si abundances in LTE for

showed that [Si/Fe] gradually decreases with [Fe/H]
from [Fe/H] ∼ −4 to [Fe/H] ∼ −1. Above [Fe/H] ∼ −1,
[Si/Fe] decreases more rapidly with increasing [Fe/H]
due to the contribution of SNe Ia. Interestingly, if the
eﬀects of rotating massive stars at Z = 0 (in addi-
tion to hypernovae, SNe II, SNe Ia, and AGB stars)
are taken into account, the [Si/Fe] versus [Fe/H] trend
that they predicted also shows a small bump around
[Fe/H] ∼ −1. Such bumps are also predicted for other
α-elements, such as S, Ca, and Ti. Therefore, our obser-
vational results are most consistent with the predictions
of Kobayashi et al. (2011). However, due to the inhomo-
geneous stellar parameters and small number of sample
stars, we are not able to make any conclusive remarks
on the Galactic chemical evolution of Si.

5. SUMMARY

As an important α-element, Si is believed to be mainly
produced by SNe II, but it is not clear whether SNe Ia
also produces some Si. Therefore, Si abundances could
be used to test the SNe and Galactic chemical evolution
models. Unfortunately, the optical Si I lines are very
weak in very metal-poor stars, and the NUV Si I lines
are either blended or very diﬃcult to be normalized. In
this regard, the Si I IR lines could be better abundance
indicators because they are usually much stronger than
the optical lines and they suﬀer much less from the prob-
lem of blending or continuum normalization compared
to the NUV lines. However, LTE is not a realistic ap-
proximation for the line formation of the Si I IR lines,
so we have investigated the non-LTE eﬀects of the Si I
IR lines in giant stars. The main results could be sum-
marized as follows.

• Si abundances based on the LTE analysis of the
Si I IR lines are overestimated (typical value of ∼
0.35 dex for giant stars), and thus are higher than
those from the optical lines which are insensitive
to the non-LTE eﬀects. However, when our non-
LTE calculations are applied, Si abundances from
the optical and the IR lines are consistent.

• The non-LTE eﬀects of the Si I infrared lines diﬀer

13

from line to line. In general, stronger lines show
larger non-LTE eﬀects (up to ∼ 0.8 dex) while
weaker lines show smaller non-LTE eﬀects (as low
as ∼ 0.1 dex). Therefore, it is not surprising that
Si abundances based on the LTE analysis of the
Si I IR lines show large line-to-line scatter (mean
value of 0.13 dex), and when our non-LTE calcula-
tions are applied, the scatter reduces signiﬁcantly
(mean value of 0.06 dex).

• The non-LTE eﬀects of the Si I infrared lines are
dependent on stellar parameters, among which the
surface gravity plays a dominant role. Giant stars
show larger non-LTE eﬀects (typical value of ∼
0.35 dex), while dwarf stars show smaller non-LTE
eﬀects (typical value of ∼ 0.1 dex).

Therefore, the Si I IR lines could be reliable abundance
indicators provided that the non-LTE eﬀects are prop-
erly taken into account. Our results remind that one
should be very careful when using the IR lines to de-
termine chemical abundances under the assumption of
LTE. In particular, the APOGEE/APOGEE-2 project
will provide high-resolution and high S/N ratio spec-
tra in the H-band for about 400,000 stars, based on
which abundances of up to 15 chemical species could
be obtained. Investigations of the non-LTE eﬀects for
the H-band spectra lines for these elements is of great
importance to improving the accuracy of abundance de-
terminations.
