Abstract. We show that an orientable pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism has vanishing Sah-
Arnoux-Fathi invariant if and only if the minimal polynomial of its dilatation is not reciprocal.
We relate this to works of Margalit-Spallone and Birman, Brinkmann and Kawamuro. Mainly,
we use Veech’s construction of pseudo-Anosov maps to give explicit pseudo-Anosov maps of
vanishing Sah-Arnoux-Fathi invariant.
In particular, we give new inﬁnite families of such
maps in genus 3.

1. Introduction

In 1981, Arnoux-Yoccoz [AY] gave the ﬁrst example of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism
whose dilatation was of degree less than twice the genus of the surface on which it is deﬁned.
In fact, they gave an inﬁnite family of these, one in each genus g ≥ 3. In his Ph.D. dissertation
of the same year, Arnoux [A2], see also [A], showed that each of these maps has vanishing
Sah-Arnoux-Fathi (SAF) invariant. Pseudo-Anosov maps with vanishing SAF-invariant are
especially interesting for their dynamical properties, see [ABB, LPV, LPV2, Mc2]. However,
there are few examples known, see below for a list of these. We ﬁnd a new inﬁnite family, and
to aid in the search for these interesting maps, we also clarify criteria in the literature derived
from work of Calta-Smillie [CS].

We characterize pseudo-Anosov maps with vanishing SAF-invariant.

Theorem 1. Suppose that φ is an orientable pseudo-Anosov map of a closed compact surface,
with dilatation λ. Then φ has vanishing Sah-Arnoux-Fathi invariant if and only if the minimal
polynomial of λ is not reciprocal.

We give explicit constructions of new inﬁnite families of pseudo-Anosov maps with vanishing

SAF-invariant.
Theorem 2. For each k ∈ N with k ≥ 2, there exists at least four orientable pseudo-Anosov
maps in the hyperelliptic component of the stratum H (2, 2) having dilatation of minimal poly-
nomial x3 − (2k + 4)x2 + (k + 4)x − 1. In particular, each of these pseudo-Anosov maps has
vanishing SAF-invariant.

In Subsection § 3.4 we apply a construction of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms given by
Margalit-Spallone [MS] to lend support to a conjecture about the set of all dilatations of pseudo-
Anosov homeomorphisms. Recall that a real algebraic number α greater than one is called
bi-Perron if all of its conjugates (other than itself) lie in the annulus {||α||−1 ≤ ||z|| < ||α||},
where ||z|| denotes the norm of a complex number. An algebraic integer, thus having minimal
polynomial with integer coeﬃcients, is a unit if its inverse is also an algebraic integer. Fried

[F] showed that the dilatation of any pseudo-Anosov map is a bi-Perron unit. A conjecture
that Farb-Margalit [FM] attribute to C. McMullen (and is a question in [F]), states that every
bi-Perron unit is the dilatation of some pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism. Recall that exactly
when a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism is orientable, its dilatation is an eigenvalue of the home-
omorphism’s induced action on ﬁrst integral homology. The construction of Margalit-Spallone
[MS] shows that any polynomial that passes a certain homological criterion, see below, is the
characteristic polynomial of the homology action induced by some pseudo-Anosov map. Using
this, we ﬁnd a partial conﬁrmation of the conjecture.

In Subsection §3.5, we answer an implicit question of Birman, Brinkmann and Kawamuro
[BBK]. Namely, if φ is an orientable pseudo-Anosov map on a genus g compact surface without
punctures, then their symplectic polynomial s(x) associated to φ is reducible if and only if either
φ has vanishing SAF-invariant, or φ has trace ﬁeld of degree less than g.

2. Background

2.1. Pseudo-Anosov map, translation surface. Suppose that X is an orientable closed real
surface of genus g ≥ 2. The Teichm¨uller modular group Mod(X) is the quotient of the group of
orientation preserving homeomorphisms by the subgroup of those homeomorphisms isotopic to
the identity. A mapping class [φ] ∈ Mod(X) is called pseudo-Anosov, if there exists a representa-
tive φ : X → X, a pair of invariant transverse measured (singular) foliations (F u, µu), (F s, µs),
and a real number λ, the dilatation of [φ], such that φ multiplies the transverse measure µu (resp.
µs) by λ (resp. λ−1). The real number λ = λ(φ) is called the dilatation of the pseudo-Anosov
homeomorphism φ. Some prefer to call λ the stretch factor of φ.
A pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism φ is called orientable if either of (and hence both) F u or
F s is orientable (that is, leaves can be consistently oriented). As [LT] recall (see their Theorem
2.4), a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism φ is orientable if and only if its dilatation is an eigenvalue
of the standard induced action on ﬁrst homology φ∗ : H1(X, Z) → H1(X, Z).

Orientability of either foliation is equivalent to every singularity having an even number of
prongs. Indeed, by Hubbard-Masur [HM] the pair of measured foliations deﬁnes a quadratic
diﬀerential and a complex structure on X so that this quadratic diﬀerential is holomorphic,
orientability corresponds to the quadratic diﬀerential being the square of a holomorphic 1-
form (thus, an abelian diﬀerential), say ω. Fixing base points and integrating ω along paths
deﬁnes local coordinates on X (in C or R2, depending on our need), transition functions are by
translations, and the result is a translation surface, (X, ω). (The aforementioned singularities
occur at the zeros of ω.) The pseudo-Anosov φ acts aﬃnely with respect to the local Euclidean
structure of (X, ω). Furthermore, taking the view of real local coordinates, SL2(R) acts on the
collection of all translation surfaces by post-composition with the local coordinate maps.

We often use the words pseudo-Anosov map to mean an orientable pseudo-Anosov homeo-

morphism (usually with an emphasis on its translation surface).

invariant of f is the element of R ∧Q R given by (cid:80)d

2.2. SAF-zero deﬁned. The Sah-Arnoux-Fathi (SAF) invariant was ﬁrst deﬁned for any in-
terval exchange transformation (for more on these interval maps, see Subsection 2.6). Given
f deﬁned on an interval I = ∪d
j=1l, Ij and given piecewise by f (x) = x + τj on Ij, the SAF-
j=1 λj ∧ τj, where λj is the length of Ij.
In [A2], Arnoux showed that any linear ﬂow on a translation surface deﬁnes a family of inter-
val exchange maps, by taking any appropriately chosen full transversal of the ﬂow, all having
the same SAF-invariant. One says that a pseudo-Anosov map has vanishing SAF-invariant if
the ﬂow in its stable direction has its ﬁrst return interval exchange transformations with this
property. (Below we will show that this is then also true of the ﬂow in the unstable direction.)

2.3. Known examples. Besides the Arnoux-Yoccoz family of SAF-zero pseudo-Anosov maps
(one per genus at least three), the other known inﬁnite families are the Arnoux-Rauzy family in
genus three discussed in [LPV2], and the examples of Calta and Schmidt [CS] found by Fuchsian
group techniques. Sporadic examples were given by Arnoux-Schmidt [AS] and in [CS]; McMullen
[Mc2] presents an example in genus three found by Lanneau.

2.4. Trace ﬁeld, periodic direction ﬁeld, Veech group. The trace ﬁeld of the translation
surface (X, ω) of a pseudo-Anosov map of dilatation λ coincides with k = Q(λ + λ−1), see
the appendix of [KS]. If a translation surface has at least three directions of vanishing SAF-
invariant, then Calta and Smillie [CSm] show that the surface can be normalized by way of
the SL2(R)-action so that the directions with slope 0, 1 and ∞ have vanishing SAF-invariant.
They further prove that on the normalized surface the set of slopes of directions with vanishing
SAF-invariant forms a ﬁeld (union with inﬁnity, thus more precisely the projective line over
the ﬁeld). A translation surface so normalized is said to be in standard form, and the ﬁeld so
described is called the periodic direction ﬁeld. Calta-Smillie also show that when (X, ω) arises
from a pseudo-Anosov map, then it can be placed in standard form, and more importantly its
trace ﬁeld and periodic direction ﬁeld coincide.
The Veech group SL(X, ω) ⊂ SL2(R) is the group of matrix parts of (orientation-preserving)
aﬃne diﬀeomorphisms of (X, ω). An aﬃne diﬀeomorphism of (X, ω) is pseudo-Anosov if and
only if its matrix part is a hyperbolic element of SL2(R), see [T, V]. Furthermore, if there is any
such pseudo-Anosov map, then SL(X, ω) ⊂ SL2(k), where k is the trace ﬁeld (this follows from
the appendix of [KS]: the trace ﬁeld is also the holonomy ﬁeld and elements of the Veech group
preserve the two dimensional k-vector space spanned by the holonomy vectors; the statement
also follows from Theorem 1.5 of [CSm]).

polynomial p(x) = (cid:80)n

2.5. Homological criterion, Margalit-Spallone construction. Margalit and Spallone [MS]
give a construction of pseudo-Anosov classes in the Teichm¨uller modular group. Recall that a
i=0 cixi is called reciprocal when ci = cn+1−i for all i = 1, ..., n. (The
characteristic polynomial of any symplectic matrix is monic reciprocal.) A monic reciprocal
polynomial with integral coeﬃcients is called symplectically irreducible if it is not the product
of reciprocal polynomials of strictly lesser degree.

The homological criterion for a monic reciprocal polynomial q(x) of even degree is that all of

the following hold.

• q(x) is symplectically irreducible,
• q(x) is not cyclotomic, and
• q(x) is not a polynomial in xk for any integral k > 1.

Margalit-Spallone extend a result of Casson-Bleiler: For any f representing a class of the
modular group of a closed surface X of genus at least two, let qf (x) be the characteristic
polynomial for the action on ﬁrst integral homology induced by f . If qf (x) passes the homological
criterion, then the class of f is pseudo-Anosov. Furthermore, by considering words in explicit
elements of the modular group, for any q(x) passing the homological criterion Margalit-Spallone
build a homeomorphism f whose homological action has characteristic polynomial q(x). Hence
the class of f (and indeed all of its Torelli group coset) is pseudo-Anosov.

2.6. Veech construction. In this subsection we mainly reproduce Lanneau’s [L] overview (fol-
lowing [MMY]) of Veech’s construction of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms using the Rauzy-
Veech induction, [V]. In this subsection we follow standard convention and let λ denote the
length vector for an interval exchange transformation.

2.6.1. Interval Exchange Transformation. An interval exchange transformation (IET) is a one-
to-one map T from an open interval I to itself that permutes, by translation, a ﬁnite partition
Ij, j = 1, ..., d of I into d ≥ 2 open subintervals. It is easy to see that T is precisely determined
by the following data: a permutation π that encodes how the intervals are exchanged, and a
vector λ with positive entries that encodes the lengths of the intervals.

It is useful to employ a redundant notation for IETs. A permutation is a pair of one-to-one
maps (π0, π1) from a ﬁnite alphabet A to 1, ..., d in the following way. In the partition of I
into intervals, we denote the interval labeled k, when counted from the left to the right, by
Iπ
1 (k). The permutation
0 (k). Once the intervals are exchanged, the interval labeled k is Iπ
−1
−1
π corresponds to the map π = π1 ◦ π−1
0 . The lengths of the intervals form a vector λ = (λα),
α ∈ A . We will usually represent the combinatorial datum π = (π0, π1) by a table:

(cid:18)π−1

π =

0 (1) π−1
π−1
1 (1) π−1

0 (2)
1 (2)

... π−1
... π−1

0 (d)
1 (d)

(cid:19)

.

It is reasonable to focus on those IET that cannot trivially be decomposed into two distinct
0 ({1, . . . , k}) =
IETs. For this, a permutation π is called reducible if for any 1 ≤ k < d, π−1
1 ({1, . . . , k}). Otherwise, π is called irreducible.
π−1
2.6.2. Suspension data. A suspension datum for T is a complex vector ζ of length d such that

(1) ∀α ∈ A , (cid:60)(ζα) = λα.
(2) ∀1 ≤ k ≤ d − 1, (cid:61)(Σπ0(α)≤kζα) > 0.
(3) ∀1 ≤ k ≤ d − 1, (cid:61)(Σπ1(α)≤kζα) < 0.
To each suspension datum ζ, we can associate a translation surface (X, ω) = X(π, ζ) in the
following way. Consider the broken line L0 on C = R2 deﬁned by concatenation of the vectors
0 (j) (in this order) for j = 1, ..., d with starting point at the origin. Similarly, we consider
ζπ
−1
1 (j) (in this order) for j = 1, ..., d
the broken line L1 deﬁned by concatenation of the vectors ζπ
−1
with starting point at the origin. If the lines L0 and L1 have no intersections other than the
endpoints, we can construct a translation surface X by identifying each side ζj on L0 with the
side ζj on L1 by a translation. The resulting surface is a translation surface endowed with the
form ω = dz.
Let I ⊂ X be the horizontal interval deﬁned by I = (0, Σαλα) ∪ {0}. Then the interval
exchange map T is precisely the one deﬁned by the ﬁrst return map to I of the vertical ﬂow on
X.

2.6.3. Rauzy-Veech induction. The Rauzy-Veech induction R(T ) of T is deﬁned as the ﬁrst
return map of T to a certain subinterval J of I. We recall very brieﬂy the construction. The
0 (d) is
1 (d) and 1 if λπ
1 (d) > λπ
type of T is 0 if λπ
−1
−1
the winner of this induction step, or that π−1
0 (d) is, respectively. We deﬁne a subinterval J of
I by

0 (d). We say that the letter π−1

0 (d) > λπ
−1

−1

(cid:40)

J =

I\T (λπ
I\λπ

−1
0 (d)

1 (d))
−1

if T is of type 0;
if T is of type 1.

The image of T by the Rauzy-Veech induction R is deﬁned as the ﬁrst return map of T to the
subinterval J. This is again an interval exchange transformation, deﬁned on d letters. Thus this
deﬁnes two maps R0 and R1 by R(T ) = (R(π), λ(cid:48)), where  is the type of T . The new data
and transition matrix are found as follows.

nonzero entry is at (α, β) where the value is 1.

Iterating the Rauzy-Veech induction n times, we obtain a sequence of transition matrices

{Vk}. We can write R(n)(π, λ) = (π(n), λ(n)) with (Πn

k=1Vk)λ(n) = λ.

We can also deﬁne the Rauzy-Veech induction on the space of suspensions by

R(π, ζ) = (Rπ, V −1ζ), where V = Πn

k=1Vk .

If (π(cid:48), ζ(cid:48)) = R(π, ζ) then the two translation surfaces X(π, ζ) and X(π(cid:48), ζ(cid:48)) are isometric, i.e.

they deﬁne the same surface in the moduli space.

For a combinatorial datum π, we call the Rauzy class of π the set of all combinatorial data
that can be obtained from π by the combinatorial Rauzy moves. The labeled Rauzy diagram of
π is the directed graph whose vertices are all combinatorial data that can be obtained from π
by the combinatorial Rauzy moves. From each vertices, there are two directed outgoing edges
labeled 0 and 1 (the type) corresponding to the two combinatorial Rauzy moves.

2.6.4. Closed loops and pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms. We are now ready to describe Veech’s
construction of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms. Let π be an irreducible permutation and let
γ be a closed loop in the Rauzy diagram associated to π. We obtain the matrix V as above;
let us assume that V is primitive (i.e. there exists k such that for all i, j, the (i, j) entry of V k
is positive) and let θ > 1 be its Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue. We choose a positive eigenvector
λ for θ. Now, V is appropriately symplectic (see [Vi] for an explanation of this result of [V]),
allowing one to choose τ an eigenvector for the eigenvalue θ−1 with τπ
0 (1) > 0. We form the
−1
vector ζ = λ + iτ . We can show that ζ is a suspension data for π. Thus, with a minor abuse of
notation,

R(π, ζ) = (π, V −1ζ) = (π, V −1λ, V −1τ ) = (π, θ−1λ, θτ ) = gt(π, λ, τ )

where t = log(θ) > 0.

The two surfaces X(π, ζ) and gtX(π, ζ) diﬀer by some element of the mapping class group.
In other words there exists a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism φ, with respect to the translation
surface X(π, θ), such that Dφ = gt.
In particular the dilatation of φ is θ. Note that by
construction φ ﬁxes the zero on the left of the interval I and also the separatrix adjacent to this
zero (namely the interval I). Veech [V] proved the following.

Theorem 3 (Veech). Let γ be a closed loop, beginning at the vertex corresponding to π, in
a unlabeled Rauzy diagram and V be the associated transition matrix. If V is primitive, then
let λ be a positive eigenvector for the Perron eigenvalue θ of V and τ be an eigenvector (with
0 (1) > 0) for the eigenvalue θ−1 of V . We have

We note that reversing the path γ, i.e. switching types 0 and 1 throughout, results in the

inverse pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism.

2.6.5. Hyperelliptic Rauzy diagrams. Our new families of examples of pseudo-Anosov maps with
vanishing SAF-invariant are constructed using hyperelliptic diagrams.
Up to now, we have discussed labeled IETs. An unlabeled IET is one for which we retain only
combinatorial data in the form of a permutation of {1, ..., d}. Equivalent classes of unlabeled
IETs are obtained after identifying (π0, π1) with (π(cid:48)
. (See Viana [Vi],
for a discussion of this, where the key term is “monodromy”.) From this, the labeled Rauzy
diagram is a covering of the so-called unlabeled Rauzy diagram.

An interval exchange transformation T is called hyperelliptic if the corresponding permutation
0 (i) = d+1−i,∀i = 1, ..., d. A particular example of such a combinatorial da-
, with corresponding monodromy permutation (d, d−1, . . . , 1).
A hyperelliptic Rauzy diagram is one that contains a combinatorial datum π of a hyperelliptic
IET. Exactly when a Rauzy diagram is hyperelliptic, the labeled and unlabeled diagrams are
isomorphic directed graphs. See Figure 1 for the unlabeled Rauzy diagram with four subinter-
vals.

from taking any other initial vertex along the path.) The following justiﬁes that normalization,

Lemma 1. Suppose that γ is a closed path in a hyperelliptic Rauzy diagram such that the
corresponding transition matrix V = V (γ) is primitive. Then γ must pass through the vertex
corresponding to εd.

Proof. Since γ is a closed path, repeating it deﬁnes an inﬁnite path in the Rauzy diagram. By
a result of Yoccoz [Y], which [Vi] reproduces, every letter must hence be a winner on γ. By
the combinatorics of the induction, the ﬁrst letter on the top row of εd is a winner exactly at
the vertices forming a cycle of length d− 1 in the hyperelliptic Rauzy diagram, similarly for the
ﬁrst letter on its bottom row. Of course these cycles meet at the vertex corresponding to εd.
(cid:3)
Therefore, γ must pass through this vertex.

2.7. Components of strata and Rauzy classes. In particular to allow experts to immedi-
ately understand the setting of our examples, we entitle certain subsections below with reference
to particular components of strata of abelian diﬀerentials. Here we brieﬂy summarize the nota-
tion and related notions.
Let g ≥ 2 be the genus of the Riemann surface X, the non-zero abelian diﬀerentials on X
have zeros whose multiplicities sum to 2g − 2. Let κ be a partition of 2g − 2, the stratum H (κ)
is the set (modulo the action of the mapping class group) of abelian diﬀerentials whose zeros
have the multiplicities of κ.

Computations by Veech and then Arnoux using Rauzy classes showed that in general strata
have more than one connected component. Kontsevich and Zorich [KZ] determined all possible
components. They showed that any stratum has at most three components: there may be a
hyperelliptic component where both X is hyperelliptic and the hyperelliptic involution preserves
ω; and possibly two more components, diﬀerentiated by the parity of an appropriate notion of
spin, these components are thus called “even” and “odd”, correspondingly. One denotes the
various components by H hyp(κ), H even(κ) and H odd(κ).

Our examples are in low genus, thus we recall only (part of) the second theorem of [KZ]:
Each of H (2) and H (1, 1) is connected (and coincides with its hyperelliptic component), while
each of H (4) and H (2, 2) has two connected components: a hyperelliptic component, and an
odd spin component.
Each Rauzy class corresponds to a single component (see [B] for details on this correspon-
dence), and indeed one ﬁnds that the number of intervals d is equal to 2g + σ − 1, where σ
equals the total number of zeros of the corresponding abelian diﬀerentials. This accords with
the fact that local coordinates on H (κ) are given by period coordinates, which one can view as
the integration of ω over a basis of relative homology H1(X, Σ, C), where Σ is the set of zeros of
ω. One can take the basis to be the union of an integral symplectic basis of absolute homology
with a set of paths from a chosen zero to each of the other zeros.

The transition matrix V = V (γ) for a closed path gives the action of the element of the
mapping class group on relative homology.
In the pseudo-Anosov case, there is some power
of the map that ﬁxes all of Σ and hence this power changes any path connecting zeros by
an element of absolute homology. On absolute homology, the pseudo-Anosov (and perforce
any of its powers) acts integrally symplectically, thus the action on relative homology of the
power decomposes naturally into a block form with the block corresponding to pure relative
homology being an identity. Thus, the characteristic polynomial of this action is the product of
a reciprocal degree 2g polynomial times a power of (x− 1). Therefore, the action of the original
pseudo-Anosov has a similar decomposition, as seen in our examples below.

3. Characterization of vanishing SAF invariant, implications

We aim to prove that a pseudo-Anosov map has vanishing SAF-invariant exactly when an

algebraic condition holds; we thus naturally ﬁrst gather some algebraic results.

3.1. Galois theory. We begin with a result using elementary Galois theory.

Proposition 1. Suppose that α is a non-zero (irrational) algebraic number. The minimal
polynomial of α over Q is reciprocal if and only if Q(α) (cid:54)= Q(α + α−1).
Proof. Let p(x) ∈ Q[x] be the minimal polynomial of α. Let q(x) ∈ Q[x] be the minimal poly-
nomial of α + α−1. Denote the degree of q(x) by n. Since α satisﬁes x2 − (α + α−1)x + 1 and
of course Q(α) ⊇ Q(α + α−1), the degree of p(x) is either n or 2n.
(⇐) Set ˜q(x) = xnq(x + x−1). Then ˜q(x) ∈ Q[x] is monic of degree 2n. Of course, ˜q(x) has
α as a root. Therefore, p(x) divides ˜q(x), and by the restrictions on the degree of p(x), either
p(x) = ˜q(x) or else p(x) has degree n. If p(x) is not reciprocal, then it cannot equal ˜q(x), as
this latter is clearly reciprocal; it then follows that n = [Q(α) : Q] = [Q(α + α−1) : Q], and thus
Q(α) = Q(α + α−1).
(⇒) Suppose now that Q(α) = Q(α + α−1). Recall that any root of q(x) is the image of α + α−1
under some ﬁeld embedding (ﬁxing Q), Q(α + α−1) (cid:44)→ C. Since Q(α) = Q(α + α−1), each such
ﬁeld embedding sends α to some root of p(x). This ﬁeld equality also implies that deg p(x) = n,
and thus we conclude that the roots of q(x) are all contained in the set of values of the form
β + β−1 with β a root of p(x). However, under the further supposition that p(x) is reciprocal
(which implies that n is even, see Lemma 2), there are only n/2 distinct values in the set of
the β + β−1. Hence, the degree of q(x) must in fact be at most n/2, and we have reached a
contradiction.
(cid:3)

For the sake of completeness, we include the following well-known result.

Lemma 2. Suppose that p(x) ∈ Z[x] is reciprocal and of odd degree (greater than one). Then
p(x) is reducible.
Proof. Given the p(x) is reciprocal, whenever α is a root pf p(x), so is α−1. Thus, the roots of
p(x) are paired together by x (cid:55)→ 1/x. This accounts for an even number of roots, except for
ﬁxed points of this map. Since p(x) has an odd number of roots, we conclude that at least one
of the ﬁxed points, x = ±1, is a root of p(x). It follows that p(x) is reducible.
(cid:3)

We draw some immediate conclusions from Proposition 1. Let us introduce a non-standard
deﬁnition: Call Q(α + α−1) the trace ﬁeld of the algebraic number α. Recall that the (algebraic)
norm of an algebraic number is the product of all of its conjugates over Q.
Corollary 1. If α is of norm one with quadratic trace ﬁeld, then Q(α) (cid:54)= Q(α + α−1).

Proof. Field equality would imply that α is quadratic, and hence with minimal polynomial of
the form p(x) = x2 + nx + 1 for some n ∈ Z. But p(x) is reciprocal of even degree and hence
ﬁeld equality cannot hold.
(cid:3)

Corollary 2. If α is a non-quadratic Pisot number, then α is non-reciprocal. Moreover, Q(α) =
Q(α + α−1).

Proof. Since the minimal polynomial p(x) of α has degree greater than two, it has a root β (cid:54)= α−1
with ||β|| < 1, therefore ||β−1|| > 1 but since p(x) has only λ as a root that has norm greater than
one, we conclude that p(x) is not a reciprocal polynomial. Thus, we can invoke Proposition 1
to ﬁnd that also the second statement holds.

(cid:3)

Motivated by this last result, we now show that every Pisot unit is bi-Perron (which presum-

ably is well-known).

Lemma 3. If α is a non-quadratic Pisot unit, then α is bi-Perron.

Proof. Let α = α1, . . . , αn be the roots of the minimal polynomial of α. Then we have that
||α1 ··· αn|| = 1, ||α1|| > 1 and for each j > 1, ||αj|| < 1. Therefore for each i > 1 we have

1
||α1||
and thus ||αi|| > 1/||α1|| and the result holds.

||αi|| =

(cid:81)
j>1,j(cid:54)=i ||αj||

(cid:3)

Lemma 4. The set of cubic bi-Perron units is exactly the set of cubic Pisot units.
Proof. Suppose that x3 + ax2 + bx + c ∈ Z[x] with c = ±1 has non-zero roots α1, α2, α3. Then
||α2α3|| = 1/||α1||, and hence α2 satisﬁes ||α2|| > 1/||α1|| if and only if ||α3|| < 1 and similarly
with the roles of α2, α3 exchanged. Thus, if α1 is indeed cubic, then its two conjugates have
norm greater than its inverse if and only if they both lie in the unit disk. Since −c = α1α2α3,
it also follows that in this setting α1 is of norm greater than one. Thus, we ﬁnd that every
cubic bi-Perron number is indeed a Pisot unit. Of course, the previous result gives the other
(cid:3)
inclusion.

Remark 1. On the other hand, not every non-reciprocal Perron unit is a Pisot number, as
already f (x) = x4 − 4x3 + 3x + 1 shows.

We verify a property required for a certain construction of pseudo-Anosov elements.

Lemma 5. If α is a non-reciprocal Perron number, let ˜q(x) be the product of the minimal
polynomial of α with the minimal polynomial of α−1. Then ˜q(x) = f (xk) with f (x) ∈ Z[x] and
k ∈ N implies k = 1.
Proof. Suppose ˜q(x) = f (xk), then certainly for any zero β of f (x) and every kth-root γ of β,
thus satisfying γk = β, we have ˜q(γ) = 0. Hence the zeros of ˜q(x) form the full set of the kth-
roots of the various zeros of f (x). But, for β ﬁxed, all of its kth-roots share the same complex
norm. Therefore, we can partition the set of roots of ˜q(x) into subsets of cardinality k with all
elements of the subset sharing the same complex norm. However, since α is bi-Perron, there is
no other root of ˜q(x) that has the same complex norm as does α. We conclude that k = 1 and
(cid:3)
of course f (x) = ˜q(x).

Similarly, we have the following.

Lemma 6. If α is a reciprocal bi-Perron number and p(x) its minimal polynomial, then p(x) =
f (xk) with f (x) ∈ Z[x] and k ∈ N implies k = 1.
Proof. Here also, the polynomial in question has α as its only root that is of complex norm ||α||.
(cid:3)
Thus, the argument used to prove the previous Lemma applies.

3.2. Proof of Theorem 1: Characterizing SAF-zero pseudo-Anosov maps.

Proof. Suppose that φ is a pseudo-Anosov map with dilatation λ. By the results of Calta-Smillie
reviewed in Subsection 2.4, we can assume that φ is an aﬃne diﬀeomorphism on (X, ω) with
matrix part being hyperbolic in k = Q(λ + λ−1) and that φ has vanishing SAF-invariant if and
only if its stable direction has slope in k.

The ﬁxed points under the M¨obius action on R ∪ {∞} of M =

are (a− d)±(cid:112)(a + d)2 − 4/(2c). Due to the projective nature of this action, the corresponding

(cid:18)a b

(cid:19)

c

d

eigenvectors of M have slopes that are the inverses of these ﬁxed points. Thus, these eigenvectors
are of slope in k exactly when (a + d)2 − 4 is a square in k. When M is the matrix part of the
aﬃne diﬀeomorphism φ on (X, ω), the eigenvectors of M give the direction of the stable and
unstable foliations for φ on (X, ω), and the trace of M equals λ + λ−1. Thus, these foliations
have directions in the trace ﬁeld exactly when (λ + λ−1)2 − 4 is a square in k. That is, φ has
vanishing SAF-invariant if and only if (λ + λ−1)2 − 4 is a square in k.
On the other hand, it is obvious that Q(λ) ⊃ k and that λ is a zero of (x − λ)(x − λ−1) =
x2 − (λ + λ−1)x + 1 ∈ k[x]. Hence Q(λ) = k if and only if the discriminant of x2 − (λ + λ−1)x + 1
is a square in k, and otherwise there is a proper containment with ﬁeld extension degree [Q(λ) :
k] = 2. However, the discriminant of x2 − (λ + λ−1)x + 1 is (λ + λ−1)2 − 4. Thus, we ﬁnd that
φ has vanishing SAF-invariant if and only if Q(λ) = Q(λ + λ−1).
(cid:3)

Our result now follows from Proposition 1.

Remark 2. Since the stable and unstable foliations of the pseudo-Anosov map correspond
to the ﬁxed points of the linear part, it follows from the above proof that either both are of
vanishing SAF-invariant, or else neither is.

3.3. Some implications. Recall that if λ is the dilatation of a (orientable) pseudo-Ansov map
φ, then we call Q(λ + λ−1) the trace ﬁeld of φ.

Corollary 3. If an orientable pseudo-Anosov map φ has quadratic trace ﬁeld, then φ has non-
vanishing SAF-invariant.
Proof. The dilatation of φ is a unit, and hence has norm ±1.
applies. In the second, the minimal polynomial (being monic) cannot be reciprocal.

In the ﬁrst case, Corollary 1
(cid:3)

Remark 3. Recall that Kenyon-Smillie [KS] showed that if (X, ω) supports an aﬃne pseudo-
Anosov map, then the trace ﬁeld of the map is the trace ﬁeld of (X, ω). We can thus compare
Corollary 3 with McMullen’s Theorem A.1 of the appendix in [Mc]. In our language, McMullen
shows that under the hypothesis that the Veech group of (X, ω) is a lattice (which certainly
implies the existence of aﬃne pseudo-Anosov maps), the trace ﬁeld of (X, ω) being quadratic
implies that the only directions of ﬂow with vanishing SAF-invariant are those for which the ﬂow
is periodic. (By Veech’s dichotomy [V2], these are the directions in which (X, ω) decomposes
into cylinders). McMullen’s result thus certainly excludes the stable foliation of pseudo-Anosov
maps from having vanishing SAF-invariant. That is, the hypothesis of lattice Veech group allows
one also to rule out (from having vanishing SAF-invariant) those non-periodic directions which
are not the stable foliations of pseudo-Anosov maps.

SAF-ZERO PSEUDO-ANOSOV MAPS

11

Remark 4. We point out that if a pseudo-Anosov map φ is of vanishing SAF-invariant and its
dilatation is not totally real, then its trace ﬁeld is also not totally real. This holds, as vanishing
SAF-invariant implies equality of the trace ﬁeld with the ﬁeld generated over Q by the dilatation.
This can be applied to allow a minor simpliﬁcation in the existence arguments of [HL].

3.4. Every bi-Perron unit has its minimal polynomial dividing the characteristic
polynomial of some pseudo-Anosov’s homological action.

Theorem 4. Suppose that α is a bi-Perron unit. Then the minimal polynomial of α divides the
characteristic polynomial of the action on ﬁrst integral homology induced by some pseudo-Anosov
map.

Proof. If α is a bi-Perron unit whose minimal polynomial p(x) is reciprocal (and hence of even)
degree say 2g, then p(x) is obviously (symplectically) irreducible. That p(x) is not cyclotomic is
clear. That p(x) = f (xk) is only trivially possible is shown in Lemma 6. Thus, the hypotheses
are all satisﬁed for the Margalit-Spallone construction of [MS] to give an explicit pseudo-Anosov
element, (indeed a full coset of the Torelli group) in the mapping class group of the genus g
surface, whose induced action on homology has characteristic polynomial p(x).
If α is a bi-Perron unit of degree g whose minimal polynomial p(x) is not reciprocal, let
ˆp(x) be the minimal polynomial of α−1. And once again let q(x) be the minimal polynomial of
α + α−1, which by Theorem 1 is also of degree g. Let ˜q(x) = xgq(x + x−1). Since both α, α−1
are roots of ˜q(x), degree considerations give that ˜q(x) = p(x)ˆp(x).

Lemma 5 shows that ˜q(x) is not equal to any non-trivial f (xk). That ˜q(x) has no cyclotomic
roots is clear, as its only roots are those of p(x), ˆp(x) and each of these is an irreducible poly-
nomial with a root that is of absolute value greater than one. Again, the hypotheses are all
satisﬁed for the Margalit-Spallone construction, so that there exist pseudo-Anosov homeomor-
phisms whose induced action on homology is of characteristic polynomial ˜q(x).

(cid:3)

Remark 5. If any of the pseudo-Anosov maps guaranteed by [MS] is orientable, then its di-
latation is an eigenvalue of the action on homology. But, the dilatation must then be α, and we
have realized α as a dilatation.

As recalled in [LT], the dilatation of a non-orientable pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism cannot
be an eigenvalue for the induced action on homology. Thus, if none of the pseudo-Anosov maps
guaranteed by [MS] is orientable, even after applying the standard double cover construction
(see say the text [FM]) we can say little more than stated in Theorem 4.

3.5. A problem of Birman et al. Birman, Brinkmann and Kawamuro [BBK] associate to
a pseudo-Anosov map φ of dilatation λ a symplectic polynomial s(x) that has λ as its largest
real root. They write “its relationship to the minimum polynomial of λ is not completely clear
at this writing.” We give an explanation in the setting that φ is orientable (and deﬁned on a
surface without punctures).

Theorem 5. Suppose that φ is an orientable pseudo-Anosov map on a surface of genus g. Let
s(x) be the polynomial associated to φ in [BBK]. Then s(x) is reducible if and only if either φ
has vanishing SAF-invariant or has trace ﬁeld of degree strictly less than g.

12

HIEU TRUNG DO AND THOMAS A. SCHMIDT

Proof. Let λ be the dilatation of φ and p(x) be the minimal polynomial of λ. Since s(x) ∈ Z[x]
is monic and has λ as a root, of course p(x) divides s(x). As well, since s(x) is a reciprocal
polynomial, whenever some α is a root of s(x) so also is α−1 a root.

If s(x) is irreducible then it equals p(x). Thus, p(x) is in particular reciprocal. Therefore, by

Theorem 1 the SAF-invariant of φ does not vanish.

Suppose now that s(x) is reducible but symplectically irreducible. Were p(x) reciprocal, then
there would exist some other factor of s(x), but this factor would perforce be reciprocal. This
contraction shows that in this case p(x) is not a reciprocal polynomial. In particular, the minimal
polynomial ˆp(x) of λ−1 is distinct from p(x). But since λ is a root of s(x), so is λ−1 and hence
ˆp(x) also divides s(x). That is ˜q(x) = p(x)ˆp(x) divides s(x). The existence of any further factor
of s(x) would lead to a contradiction of the symplectic irreducibility of s(x). That is, whenever
s(x) is reducible but symplectically irreducible it is exactly the product ˜q(x) = p(x)ˆp(x) and
p(x) is not reciprocal. By Theorem 1 the SAF-invariant of φ vanishes.

Finally, suppose that s(x) is symplectically reducible. We have that either p(x) is reciprocal
or that ˜q(x) = p(x)ˆp(x) divides s(x). In either case, there is some other reciprocal factor of
s(x). Thus the degree of p(x) or ˜q(x) is correspondingly of degree less than 2g and as the trace
ﬁeld Q(λ + λ−1) has dimension over Q equal to one-half of the degree of p(x) or ˜q(x) in these
(cid:3)
respective cases, we indeed ﬁnd that the trace ﬁeld of φ has degree strictly less than g.

Remark 6. In particular, Example 5.2 of [BBK] shows that the monodromy of the hyperbolic
knot 89 leads to an orientable pseudo-Anosov map with s(x) = (x3 − 2x2 + x − 1)(x3 − x2 +
2x − 1). Here the dilatation λ is the real root of x3 − x2 + 2x − 1, the second factor is the
minimal polynomial of 1/λ. Using its minimal polynomial, one easily shows that λ equals
−(λ + λ−1)2 + 3(λ + λ−1) − 1, implying that indeed Q(λ) = Q(λ + λ−1).

4. Spinning about small loops

4.1. Rediscovering the Arnoux-Rauzy family of H odd(2, 2). Mimicking the construction
of [AY], Arnoux and Rauzy [AR] constructed an inﬁnite family of IETs, the ﬁrst two of which
Lowenstein, Poggiaspalla, and Vivaldi [LPV, LPV2] studied in detail, as these lead to SAF-
zero pseudo-Anosov maps.
Indeed, by making an appropriate adjustment, Lowenstein et al.
renormalized these ﬁrst two IETs in such a way that each was periodic under Rauzy induction.
Each corresponds to a cycle passing through the same 29 vertices in the 294-vertex Rauzy class
of 7-interval IETs, and under the Veech construction leads to a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism.
The dilatations of these are the largest root of x3 − 7x2 + 5x− 1 = 0 and x3 − 10x2 + 6x− 1 = 0
respectively.

Presumably, Lowenstein et al.

intend that one follow their recipe for constructing pseudo-
Anosov homeomorphisms for the remainder of the Arnoux-Rauzy family. This seemed somewhat
daunting to us. However, we found that one can succeed by adjusting the cycle given by the ﬁrst
Arnoux-Rauzy IET by spinning about certain small cycles. Since the Arnoux-Yoccoz pseudo-
Anosov homeomorphism in genus 3 corresponds to an abelian diﬀerential in H odd(2, 2) (for this
and much more see [HLM]), all of these examples (since they arise from the same Rauzy class)
are in this same connected component.
More precisely, for each k ≥ 1, the path ρk = 00001010(111111)k−11101(00)k−1010100111,
starting from the permutation (7354621), gives these maps. (Here and throughout, exponents
as in the expression for ρk indicate repeated concatenation of the correspondingly grouped
symbols.) One then ﬁnds that the characteristic polynomial of the induced transition matrix for
γk is pk(x) = (x3 − (3k + 4)x2 + (k + 4)x − 1)(x3 − (k + 4)x2 + (3k + 4)x − 1)(x − 1). To verify
this, break up ρk into ﬁve paths corresponding to 00001010, (111111)k, 1101, (00)k, 010100111,

SAF-ZERO PSEUDO-ANOSOV MAPS

and compute their transition matrices. From this, one easily shows that the associated matrix
for γk is the matrix

Remark 7. Erwan Lanneau has informed us that (in unpublished work) he also found this
family, in virtually the same manner.
4.2. Two known examples in H hyp(4). Veech [V2] constructed an inﬁnite family of trans-
lation surfaces with Veech groups that are lattices in SL2(R). For each n ≥ 5, his construction is
to identify, by translation, parallel sides of a regular n-gon and its mirror image. In the case of
n = 7, one ﬁnds a genus 3 surface with exactly one singularity of cone angle 8π. Veech shows that

In [AS], it is pointed out that results on (Rosen) continued fractions of Rosen and Towse [RT]
imply that on this surface there is a SAF-zero pseudo-Anosov; indeed this is the map, say ψ, of
linear part Dψ = ST S−1T . Explicitly taking a transversal to the ﬂow in the expanding direction
for ψ, and following Rauzy induction on the corresponding IET, we found that ψ results from
the loop displayed in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Red loop representing ψ, a pseudo-Anosov on Veech’s double hep-
tagon surface.

The primitive matrix associated with this loop has characteristic polynomial (x3 − 6x2 + 5x−

1)(x3 − 5x2 + 6x − 1), verifying that the SAF invariant vanishes.

Lanneau’s example, given in [Mc2], has as its dilatation the largest root of x3 − 8x2 + 6x− 1.
We noticed that both ψ and this example correspond to paths passing through the same 15
vertices of the hyperelliptic Rauzy graph of 6-interval IETs. These paths only diﬀer in that
Lanneau’s has added spins (indeed, the “top right” 1-loop is repeated four times).

4.3. New families of pseudo-Anosov maps in H hyp(2, 2). Motivated by the previous ex-
amples, we sought an inﬁnite family of pseudo-Anosov with dilatation being the largest root of
x3 − (2k + 4)x2 + (k + 4)x − 1. We found such a family, but rather by taking certain paths in
the hyperelliptic Rauzy graph of 7-intervals IETs. This graph is shown in Figure 3. We ﬁnd in
fact four distinct families, and thus new examples of pseudo-Anosov maps with vanishing SAF-
invariant. Naturally enough, we describe the paths as starting at the vertex of π = (7654321).

4.4. Examples in other strata. The similarities in patterns of the paths for the Veech hep-
tagon and Lanneau’s pseudo-Anosov maps in H hyp(4) and those of our examples in H hyp(2, 2),
motivated us to investigate similar patterns in the Rauzy hyperelliptic diagrams for 8 and 9
subintervals. We discovered several isolated examples of SAF-zero maps here, i.e. in the com-
ponents H hyp(6) and H hyp(3, 3). However, an inﬁnite family is yet to be found. Below, we
also include other examples in genus 3.

with 6 subintervals. The following examples start at the hyperelliptic pair π = (6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1).
We will give the paths and the characteristic polynomial of the associated matrix. Hence, we
can see the loops produce SAF-zero pseudo-Anosov from the cubic factors of the characteristic
polynomials.

4.4.2. Seven genus 4 examples in H hyp(6). We look into the Rauzy hyperelliptic diagram with
8 subintervals. The following examples start at the hyperelliptic pair π = (8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1).
We will give the paths and the characteristic polynomial of the associated matrix. Hence, we
can see the loops produce SAF-zero pseudo-Anosov from the cubic factors of the characteristic
polynomials.
