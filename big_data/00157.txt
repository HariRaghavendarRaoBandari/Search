In this paper, the existence and uniqueness of solution of a speciﬁc differential equation is studied. This

equation originates from the description of a coupled process by totally asymmetric simple exclusion process

(TASEP) and Langmuir kinetics (LK). In the ﬁelds of physics and biology, the properties of the TASEP-LK

coupled process have been extensively studied by Monte Carlo simulations and numerical calculations, as well

as detailed experiments. However, so far, no rigorous mathematical analysis has been given to the corresponding

differential equations, especially their existence and uniqueness of solution. In this paper, using the upper and

lower solution method, the existence of solution of the steady state equation is obtained. Then using a gener-

alized maximum principle, we show that the solution constructed from the upper and lower solution method

is actually the unique solution in C∞ space. Moreover, the existence and uniqueness of solution of the time

dependent differential equation are also obtained in one speciﬁc space X β. Our results imply that the previous

results obtained by numerical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations are theoretically correct, especially the

most important phase diagram of particle density along the travel track under different model parameters. The

main difﬁculties encountered in the analysis are that, as the length of the travel track tends to inﬁnity (corre-

sponding to parameter ǫ → 0 in the differential equation), there may exist boundary layers at one or both of

the boundaries. Meanwhile, in some domains of the parameter space, domain wall may also appear, which is

deﬁned as the boundary separating high and low values of the particle density. The study in this paper provides

theoretical foundations for the analysis of TASEP-LK coupled process. At the same time, the methods used in

this paper may be instructive for studies about the more general cases of the TASEP-LK process, such as the

one with multiple travel tracks or the one with multiple particle species.

INTRODUCTION

Inspired by the unidirectional motions of many motor proteins along cytoskeletal ﬁlaments [1–3], a process for describing

the stochastic driven system along a one-dimensional lattice is proposed in [4] and then deeply discussed in [5–7]. This process

couples the one-dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) [8–11] with the Langmuir kinetics (LK), see

Fig. 1. A rich steady state phase diagram, with high and low density phases, two and three phase coexistence regions, and a

boundary independent “Meissner” phase, is found by considering a continuum limit [4, 6, 7]. Such proﬁles of particle density

are very different from those of the classical TASEP model [12–14]. The pure TASEP model is in fact the limiting case of the

coupling model when the attachment and detachment rates of LK tend to zero [5].

Steady state solutions of the differential equation describing classical TASEP can be obtained by various methods [12–14].

Where the recursion method presented in [13, 14] is very technical, and is hard to generalize to analyze the TASEP-LK coupled

process. Meanwhile, although the matrix formulation used in [12] is tidy, for TASEP-LK coupled process, its network structure

indicates that the methods of this standard matrix product ansatz could be rather difﬁcult to implement [5].

The TASEP process can be analyzed by mean ﬁeld approximation [15]. Using mean ﬁeld approximation, a continuum limit

of TASEP-LK coupled process is presented in [5]. Actually, this continuum limit of TASEP-LK coupled process is a semi-linear

initial value parabolic problem with Dirichlet boundary condition.

In previous studies, Eq. (2) has been solved numerically to obtain the phase diagram of ρ(x). In this paper, we will analyze

Eqs. (1,2) rigorously, especially the existence and uniqueness of their solutions, and the relations between the solution of Eq. (1)

and the solution of Eq. (2). Our main results are as follows. There exists a unique W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution for Eq. (2). Such a
solution has the regularity of C∞[0, 1]. The phase diagram of steady state solution of the TASEP-LK coupled process, i.e. the
solution of Eq. (2), coincides with that obtained numerically in [4, 5]. For α > 3/4, Eq. (1) has a unique global X α solution,
and there exists a global attractor in X α. Here X α is a function space which will be deﬁned in Section V (see also [16]). For
cases α > 3/4, we have X α = W 2α,2

(0, 1), see Eq. (294).

Inspired by the idea of Lam et al. in [17], which is used to study a diffusive logistic equation originating from population

models in disrupted environments [18–22], we will analyze Eq. (2) by the method of upper and lower solution [23]. Compared

with related methods in perturbation theory, such as boundary layer theory and WKB theory [24–26], the method of upper and

lower solution can handle quasi-linear problems, and has strict theoretical basis. The uniqueness of weak solution of Eq. (2) in

W 1,2(0, 1) can be obtained by the comparison principle for divergence form operator which is obtained by Trudinger in [27] (or
see Theorem 10.7 in [28]).

Eq. (1) is an evolutionary partial differential equation, which describes the evolution of the spatial solution with time. In this

paper, the existence and uniqueness of a local solution of Eq. (1) will be ﬁrstly veriﬁed. Then its unique extendibility to the

whole half line t ∈ [0, +∞) is proved. For Eq. (1), except the existence and uniqueness of solution, the global attractiveness of
the steady state solution is also an important issue. In our study, the existence of global attractor will be proved by the theory

of sectorial operator [16]. We want to emphasize that in this paper, only the existence of global attractor will be proved, while

whether the steady state solution, obtained from Eq. (2), is the global attractor has not been solved yet.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we will introduce the TASEP-LK coupled process brieﬂy and then give its

continuum limit, i.e. the parabolic problem listed in Eq. (1). In Section III, we use the method of upper and lower solution

to prove the existence of a weak solution of Eq. (2) in W 1,2(0, 1), which has the same phase diagram as numerically obtained
in [5]. Then we show that this weak solution in W 1,2[0, 1] is in fact a classical C∞ solution. In section IV, we will prove
the uniqueness of the solution of Eq. (2) in C1[0, 1] [which is actually in W 1,2(0, 1)] by the methods presented in [28] for
quasi-linear elliptic equation. In Section V, the existence and uniqueness of the global X α solution, as well as the existence of

the global attractor in X α, will be discussed by the sectorial operator theory. Finally, conclusions and remarks will be presented
in Section VI.

II. TASEP-LK COUPLED PROCESS AND ITS CONTINUUM LIMIT

In this section, we will brieﬂy introduce the TASEP-LK coupled process, and then derive its continuum limit. A diagram to

illustrate the TASEP-LK coupled process is given in Fig. 1. One can always refer to it as reading this section.

In TASEP, particles from the same species hop unidirectionally along a one-dimensional lattice with constant rate (usually

normalized to be unit), but with spatial exclusion. Which means that particles at site i will hop to site i + 1 if site i + 1 is not

occupied. If the initial (left) site i = 1 is vacancy, particles in environment will bind to it with rate α. Meanwhile, particles at
the terminal (right) site i = N will leave the lattice with rate β. The Langmuir kinetics (LK) means that particles can also attach
to or detach from the main body of the lattice (for sites 2 ≤ i ≤ N − 1) with constant rates, denoted by ωA and ωD respectively
[5, 7]. Let ρi(t) be the probability that site i is occupied by a particle at time t. One can easily show that under independent
assumption, ρi(t) is governed by the following equations [5, 7].

∂tρi = ρi−1(1 − ρi) − ρi(1 − ρi+1) + ωA(1 − ρi) − ωDρi, 2 ≤ i ≤ N − 1,

∂tρ1 = α(1 − ρ1) − ρ1(1 − ρ2),

∂tρN = ρN −1(1 − ρN ) − βρN .

If we expand the deﬁnition of ρi to ρ0 ≡ α, and ρN +1 ≡ 1 − β, then Eq. (3) can be rewritten as

∂tρi = ρi−1(1 − ρi) − ρi(1 − ρi+1) + ωA(1 − ρi) − ωDρi,

2 ≤ i ≤ N − 1,

∂tρ1 = ρ0(1 − ρ1) − ρ1(1 − ρ2),

∂tρN = ρN −1(1 − ρN ) − ρN (1 − ρN +1),

ρ0 = α,

ρN +1 = 1 − β.

Let x := i/(N + 1), ρ(x, t) := ρi, ǫ := 1/(N + 1). In this paper, we always assume that ΩA := ωA/ǫ and ΩD := ωD/ǫ are
nonzero constants. Which means that rates ωA, ωD are of order ǫγ with γ = 1. For γ 6= 1, the TASEP-LK coupled process will
reduce to pure TASEP or LK process [29, 30]. Therefore, the most complicated case which has rich physical properties is that
ωA, ωD are of order ǫ.

For simplicity, denote ρt := ∂tρ, ρx := ∂xρ, ρxx := ∂2

xρ. Expanding ρ(x ± ǫ, t) in powers of ǫ,

ρ(x ± ǫ, t) = ρ(x, t) ± ǫρx(x, t) +

ǫ2ρxx(x, t) + O(ǫ3).

Then substituting Eq. (5) into Eq. (4) and only keeping terms of ǫ up to order two, we obtain

When N is large, we may neglect the inﬂuences at x = 1/(N + 1), N/(N + 1), then Eq. (6) reduces to

ρt = ǫ[ ǫ
ρt = ǫ[ ǫ

2 ρxx + (2ρ − 1)ρx + ΩA(1 − ρ) − ΩDρ],

Giving initial condition ρ(x, 0) = ρ0(x), we then obtain Eq. (1). In the following discussion, we will ﬁrstly discuss the existence
and uniqueness of the solution of the steady state equation (2) in Sections III and IV, and then discuss the properties of the time

dependent equation (1) in Section V.

III. EXISTENCE OF THE STEADY STATE SOLUTION IN W 1,2(0, 1) WITH SPECIFIC PHASE DIAGRAM

The steady state solution of Eq. (1) satisﬁes the one-dimensional boundary value elliptic equation (2). In previous studies

[5–7], through Monte Carlo simulations and numerical computations, it has been found that, with different choices of initial rate

α and terminal rate β, the ǫ → 0 limit of the solution of Eq. (2) will change essentially. There are phase transitions driven
by boundary values. See also references [31, 32] for experimental observations. The main aim of this Section is to show the

existence of a W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution of Eq. (2), which tends to f as ǫ → 0. Here, for convenience f denotes the limit solution
corresponding to ǫ = 0, obtained previously by numerical computations [5–7]. Our proof relies on the method of upper and
lower solution. Concretely, it includes mainly two steps.

• We ﬁrst construct two functions ρu and ρl which are arbitrarily close to f and satisfy ρu ≥ ρl.

• Then we prove that there exists an ǫ0, such that for any ǫ < ǫ0, ρu and ρl are the upper and lower solutions of Eq. (2)

respectively.

For convenience, the method of upper and lower solution is brieﬂy introduced in the following subsection.

A. The method of upper and lower solution

Eq. (2) has the following quasi-linear form,

− [A(x, ρ, ρx)]x + p(x, ρ, ρx) = 0,

for x ∈ (0, 1), ρ(0) = α, ρ(1) = 1 − β.

(8)

with A(x, ρ, ρx) = ǫ
four conditions needed in the method of upper and lower solution [23],

2 ρx, p(x, ρ, ρx) = −(2ρ − 1)ρx − ΩA(1 − ρ) + ΩDρ. We claim that A(x, t, ξ) = ǫ

2 ξ satisﬁes the following

• A : R × R × R → R satisﬁes the Caratheodory conditions, i.e., A(x, t, ξ) is measurable in x ∈ (0, 1) for any ﬁxed

(t, ξ) ∈ R × R, and continuous for (t, ξ) for a.e. ﬁxed x ∈ (0, 1).

• There exist constants q ∈ (1, ∞), c0 ≥ 0, and a function k0 ∈ Lq′

(0, 1) with q′ = q/(q − 1) such that, for a.e. x ∈ (0, 1)

and (t, ξ) ∈ R × R,

|A(x, t, ξ)| ≤ k0(x) + c0(|t|q−1 + |ξ|q−1).

• For a.e. x ∈ (0, 1), for all t ∈ R and ξ, ξ′ ∈ R with ξ 6= ξ′,

[A(x, t, ξ) − A(x, t, ξ′)](ξ − ξ′) > 0.

• For some c1 > 0 and k1 ∈ Lq′

(0, 1), for a.e. x ∈ (0, 1) and all (t, ξ) ∈ R × R,

A(x, t, ξ)ξ ≥ c1|ξ|q − k1(x).

(9)

(10)

(11)

Denote the above four conditions by Condition A.
c0 = c1 = ǫ/2, and k1 = 0.

It is easy to show that A satisﬁes Condition A with q = 2, k0 = 0,

According to the Deﬁnition 4.7 of a weak upper (lower) solution in [23], and resembling the Lemma 5.2 in [17], we have the

6

following Lemma.

Lemma 1. w is a weak upper (lower) solution of Eq. (2) if

1. w ∈ C[0, 1];

2. there exists a partition 0 = x0 < x1 < x2 < · · · < xk−1 < xk = 1 such that for all i = 0, · · · , k − 1, w ∈ C2[xi, xi+1]

and satisﬁes

ǫ
2

wxx + (2w − 1)wx + ΩA(1 − w) − ΩDw ≤ 0(≥ 0) in [xi, xi+1];

(12)

3. for all i = 1, · · · , k − 1, wx(x−

i ) ≥ wx(x+

i )(≤);

4. w(0) ≥ α(≤), w(1) ≥ 1 − β(≤).

Proof. The lemma can be easily veriﬁed via integration by parts.

Based on Lemma 1 and the Theorem 4.9 in [23], we have

Theorem 1. Suppose that v and w satisfy the sufﬁcient condition in Lemma 1 for weak lower and upper solutions of Eq. (2)
respectively, and m ≤ v ≤ w ≤ M in (0, 1) for some constants m, M . Then Eq. (2), whose quasi-linear part A (see Eq. (8))
satisﬁes Condition A, has a weak solution ρ ∈ w1,2(0, 1) satisfying v ≤ ρ ≤ w a.e. in (0, 1).

Proof. For all x ∈ (0, 1), ξ ∈ R, and t ∈ [v(x), w(x)] ⊂ [m, M ],

|p(x, t, ξ)| = | − (2t − 1)ξ − ΩA(1 − t) + ΩDt| ≤ max(|2M − 1|, |2m − 1|)|ξ| + (ΩA + ΩD) max(|M |, |m|) + ΩA. (13)

The proof is straightforward with the Theorem 4.9 in [23].

B. Preliminaries: properties of an ordinary differential equation

Before constructing upper and lower weak solutions of Eq. (2), we have a glance at the following ﬁrst order ordinary differ-

ential equation (ODE), which will be very useful in the construction of upper and lower solutions of Eq. (2) with speciﬁc phase

diagram (i.e. when domain wall or boundary layer appears).

ǫ
2

∂xw = −(w − A)(w − (1 − A)), A ≤ 1/2, w(x0) = w0.

Let ˜w(x) := w(ǫ(x − x0) + x0) = w(y), y := ǫ(x − x0) + x0. Then

∂x ˜w(x) = ∂xw(y) = ǫ∂yw(y)
2
ǫ

[−(w(y) − A)(w(y) − (1 − A))]

= ǫ

= −2( ˜w(x) − A)( ˜w(x) − (1 − A)).

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

Note that ˜w(x) is independent of ǫ, while w is a contraction in x direction of ˜w(x) centred at x0. One can easily verify that
w(x0) = ˜w(x0) = w0, and ˜w(x) has the following properties.

7

• If w0 ≥ (1 − A), then limx→+∞ ˜w(x) = 1 − A from above.

• If w0 ≤ A, then limx→−∞ ˜w(x) = A from below.

• If A < w0 < 1 − A, then limx→+∞ ˜w(x) = 1 − A from below, and limx→−∞ ˜w(x) = A from above.

As a consequence, one can easily show that w(x) has the following properties.

• If w0 ≥ (1 − A), then for any x > x0, limǫ→0+ w(x) = limǫ→0+ ˜w(x0 + (x − x0)/ǫ) = 1 − A.

• If w0 ≤ A, then for any x < x0, limǫ→0+ w(x) = limǫ→0+ ˜w(x0 + (x − x0)/ǫ) = A.

• If A < w0 < (1 − A), then for any x > x0, limǫ→0+ w(x) = limǫ→0+ ˜w(x0 + (x − x0)/ǫ) = 1 − A, and for any x < x0,

limǫ→0+ w(x) = limǫ→0+ ˜w(x0 + (x − x0)/ǫ) = A.

In fact, w satisﬁes

0 =

ǫ
2

wxx + (2w − 1)wx.

(18)

This is the continuum limit of a pure TASEP without LK, which can only generate a domain wall from down to up [12–14, 33].
Which means that at the location xw of the domain wall, w(x−
w ). The domain wall in TASEP-LK coupled process
may be similar as that in pure TASEP. Perhaps this can explain why no domain wall from up to down is found in numerical

w ) < w(x+

computations and stochastic simulations [5–7].

To get a glance of the basic properties of the solution w of Eq. (14), three typical examples of w, obtained by choosing
parameter A = 0.25 and with conditions w(0.5) = 0.5, w(0) = 1, and w(1) = 0 respectively, are plotted in Fig. 4f. For each
example, ﬁgures of w with three values of parameter ǫ, ǫ = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, are plotted. These plots show that the smaller the

value of ǫ is, the steeper the domain wall (or boundary layer) will be.

From the above discussion, we conclude that the limit ˆw of w as ǫ → 0 is as follows.

• If w(0) = w0 ≥ 1 − A,

• If w(1) = w0 ≤ A,

• If A < w(x0) = w0 < 1 − A for some x0 ∈ (0, 1),

An obvious corollary of the above property is that limǫ→0+ ∂xw(x) = 0 for x 6= x0.

C. Construction of upper and lower weak solutions of Eq. (2): special cases ΩA = ΩD = Ω

According to Theorem 1, to show that there exists a W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution of Eq. (2) which tends to f as ǫ → 0, it is
sufﬁcient to construct two functions ρu and ρl which satisfy ρu ≥ ρl, and there exists ǫ0 > 0, for any 0 < ǫ < ǫ0, ρu and ρl are
upper and lower weak solutions of Eq. (2) respectively, i.e., they satisfy the conditions in Lemma 1. Note that ρu and ρl may
depend on ǫ. For convenience, we denote

Lρ :=

ǫ
2

∂2
xρ + (2ρ − 1)∂xρ + ΩA(1 − ρ) − ΩDρ.

(22)

Our main aim in this subsection and the next subsection is to construct functions ρu and ρl with the following properties, upon
different boundary conditions for α and β of Eq. (2). Detailed descriptions about how this method works will be given in Lemma
3 after deﬁning ‘∆ neighbourhood’ and ‘arbitrarily close’.

• By choosing corresponding parameter values, ρu and ρl can be arbitrarily close to f . Meanwhile, ρu ≥ ρl for x ∈ [0, 1].

• ρu and ρl are continuous, and they are piecewise functions in C2(0, 1). At splitting points 0 < xi < 1, ∂−

x ρu(xi) ≥

x ρu(xi) and ∂−
∂+

x ρl(xi) ≤ ∂+

x ρl(xi).

• For any ǫ small enough, ρu(0) ≥ α ≥ ρl(0), and ρu(1) ≥ 1 − β ≥ ρl(1).

• For any ǫ small enough, Lρu ≤ 0 ≤ Lρl.

In this paper, the meaning that functions ρu and ρl are arbitrarily close to numerical solution f is deﬁned as follows.

Deﬁnition 1. Suppose f is a piecewise continuous function with discontinuity points x1, x2, · · · , xk ∈ [0, 1]. We say that a
function ρ belongs to the ∆ neighbourhood of f if




f (x) − ∆ < ρ(x) < f (x) + ∆,

x ∈ [0, 1] \ ∪k

i=1[xi − ∆, xi + ∆],

miny∈[0,1]∩[xi−∆,xi+∆] f (y) − ∆ < ρ(x) < maxy∈[0,1]∩[xi−∆,xi+∆] f (y) + ∆, x ∈ [0, 1] ∩ [xi − ∆, xi + ∆].

(23)

A sufﬁcient condition for ρ belonging to the ∆ neighbourhood of f is that there exist ρu, ρl belonging to the ∆ neighbourhood
of f , and ρl ≤ ρ ≤ ρu for x ∈ [0, 1]. Assuming index ǫ > 0, we say that a group of functions ρǫ → f as ǫ → 0+, if for any
∆ > 0, there exists ǫ0 > 0, such that for any 0 < ǫ < ǫ0, ρǫ belongs to the ∆ neighbourhood of f .

For the ∆ neighbourhood of f , we have the following result.

Lemma 2. Suppose f is a piecewise continuous function with discontinuity points x1, x2, · · · , xk ∈ [0, 1], and g is a piecewise
continuous function with discontinuity points y1, y2, · · · , yl ∈ [0, 1]. For ∆ small enough, if ρ belongs to the ∆/2 neighbourhood
of g, and g belongs to the ∆/2 neighbourhood of f , then ρ belongs to the ∆ neighbourhood of f .

Proof. Choose ∆ small enough such that ∆ < min1≤i≤l |g(y+
i )|, and the pairwise intersections of [xj − ∆, xj + ∆],
1 ≤ j ≤ k are all empty. Suppose there exists yi /∈ ∪k
i ) cannot lie in interval
(f (yi) − ∆/2, f (yi) + ∆/2) together, which is contradictory to the Lemma’s condition. Thus, ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ l, ∃ 1 ≤ j ≤ k, such
that [yi − ∆/2, yi + ∆/2] ⊂ [xj − ∆, xj + ∆]. Therefore, for x ∈ [xi − ∆, xi + ∆], we always have

j=1[xj − ∆/2, xj + ∆/2], then g(y+

In this subsection, we will discuss the special cases in which ΩA = ΩD = Ω. For these cases, the elliptic boundary value

In the following discussion, the same symbols will be used repeatedly in different sub-subsections. Such as ρu–upper solution,
ρl–lower solution, f –limit solution of Eq. (2) with ǫ → 0, etc.

In the following of this subsection, we will construct the upper solution ρu and lower solution ρl of Eq. (2) by splitting the
parameter space into several different domains, (1) α + Ω > β, β + Ω > α, and α + β + Ω < 1, (2) α < 0.5, β < 0.5, and
α + β + Ω > 1, (3) α > 0.5, and 0.5 − Ω < β < 0.5, (4) α > β + Ω, β < 0.5 − Ω, and α + β + Ω < 1, (5) α > β + Ω,
β < 0.5 − Ω, and α + β + Ω > 1, (6) α > 0.5, and β > 0.5. Other cases can be obtained by the particle-hole symmetry [34],
see Fig. 1Right.

For these cases, the expression of f is as follows,

For convenience, we denote the ǫ → 0 limit of wu, ρu, wl, ρl by ˆwu, ˆρu, ˆwl, ˆρl respectively. One can easily verify that,

From the functions ρu, ρl and ˆρu, ˆρl, the existence of W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution of Eq. (26) can be obtained by the following

Lemma.

Lemma 3. If the following four conditions are satisﬁed, then ∀ ∆ > 0, there exists ǫ0 > 0, such that for any ǫ < ǫ0, there
exists a W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution ρs of Eq. (26), which belongs to the ∆ neighbourhood of f . Or equivalently, there exists a
W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution ρs of Eq. (26) which tends to f as ǫ → 0.

• ∀ ∆ > 0, there exist ˆρu, ˆρl belonging to the ∆/2 neighbourhood of f .

• ∀ ∆ > 0, there exists ǫ1 > 0, such that ∀ ǫ < ǫ1, ρu, ρl belong to the ∆/2 neighbourhood of ˆρu and ˆρl respectively.

• There exists ǫ2 > 0, ∀ ǫ < ǫ2, ρu ≥ ρl.

• There exists ǫ3 > 0, ∀ ǫ < ǫ3, ρu and ρl are the upper and lower solutions of Eq. (26) respectively (i.e., they satisfy the

sufﬁcient conditions in Lemma 1).

Proof. For any ∆ > 0, let ǫ0 = min{ǫ1, ǫ2, ǫ3}. Then for any ǫ < ǫ0, based on the ﬁrst two conditions and Lemma 2, we know
that ρu and ρl belong to the ∆ neighbourhood of f . Therefore, according to the third and fourth conditions as well as Theorem
1, there exists a W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution ρs of Eq. (26), satisfying ρl ≤ ρs ≤ ρu. Finally, using the sufﬁcient condition in
Deﬁnition 1, ρs belongs to the ∆ neighbourhood of f .

We claim that functions ρu, ρl and ˆρu, ˆρl, as given in Eqs. (29,32,34,35), satisfy the four conditions in Lemma 3. Since
limǫ→0 ρu = ˆρu, limǫ→0 ρl = ˆρl, the second condition is naturally satisﬁed. From Eqs. (27,34,35) and the deﬁnitions of
A, xu, xl, one can easily show that by choosing δ small enough, ˆρu and ˆρl can be arbitrarily close to f . Meanwhile, one can also

11

verify that if Ω − Ω′ and Ω − Ω′′ are small enough, then ρu > ρl is valid ∀ ǫ > 0. Therefore, the ﬁrst and the third conditions in
Lemma 3 are satisﬁed. In the following discussion, we show that ρu is an upper solution of Eq. (26), i.e., satisfying the sufﬁcient
conditions in Lemma 1.

Taking the derivative of Eq. (28), we obtain

ǫ
2

∂2
xwu + (2wu − 1)∂xwu = 0.

Substituting Eq. (29) into Eq. (26), and using Eq. (36), we have

Lρu =

xwu + (2ρu − 1)∂xwu = 2Ω[x − (xu +

since ∂xwu > 0 in interval [0, 1], see Eq. (28). Meanwhile,

Lρu =

xwu + (2ρu − 1)(∂xwu + Ω′ − Ω) = 2Ω′[x − (xu +

for x > xu +

which holds if ǫ is small enough, since limǫ→0 ∂xwu(x) → 0 uniformly for 1 ≥ x > xu + δ/4 [see Eq. (34)], Ω′ < Ω, and
2ρu − 1 > 0 for x > xu + δ

4 [see Eq. (28,29)].

It is obvious that ρu is continuous at x = xu+ δ

4 , and ∂−

x ρ(xu+ δ

4 ) = ∂xwu(xu+ δ

4 )+Ω > ∂xwu(xu+ δ

Meanwhile, since wu(0) > A,

ρu(0) = wu(0) + Ω[−(xu +

(39)

and the discussion below Eq. (29) gives

ρu(1) = wu(1) + Ω′[1 − (xu +

δ
4

)] > 1 − β.

(40)

From Lemma 1, we conclude that ρu is an upper solution of Eq. (26). Through similar methods one can show that ρl, given by
Eq. (32), is a lower solution of Eq. (26). Therefore, the fourth condition in Lemma 3 is satisﬁed.

So functions ρu, ρl and ˆρu, ˆρl, as given in Eqs. (29,32,34,35), satisfy all the four conditions of Lemma 3. Hence, for these
special cases, i.e., for α + Ω > β, β + Ω > α, and α + β + Ω < 1, there exists a W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution ρs of Eq. (26) which
tends to f as ǫ → 0.

2. For cases α < 0.5, β < 0.5, and α + β + Ω > 1

For these cases, the expression of f is as follows,

f (x) =

The lower solution ρl can be obtained by the same methods. Let

with constant C′ > 0 large enough such that ql < f for x < x′

q. Deﬁne x4 as the root of ∂xql(x) = Ω′′ with constant Ω′′ satisfying Ω′′ < Ω. One can easily get x4 = − Ω′′

ρl =




One can verify that for Ω − Ω′′ small enough, ρl(0) < α.

Examples of ρu and ρl are plotted in Fig. 2b (dashed lines). We claim that ρu and ρl given here satisfy all the four conditions
listed in Lemma 3. As stated before, the second condition is satisﬁed naturally. If Ω − Ω′ and Ω − Ω′′ are small enough, then
ρu > ρl is valid, so the third condition is satisﬁed. For these special cases, ρu and ρl are independent of ǫ, and ρu and ρl can
be arbitrarily close to f if δ is small enough. Which means that the ﬁrst condition is satisﬁed. To show that the ﬁnal condition
of Lemma 3 is satisﬁed, we only need to verify that ρu and ρl satisfy the sufﬁcient conditions in Lemma 1. In the following
discussion, we will only show that ρu satisﬁes the sufﬁcient conditions in Lemma 1, and therefore is an upper solution. The
lower solution ρl can be veriﬁed similarly.

One can easily show that ρu(0) = δ

2 + α > α, ρu(1) = g(Ω′) > 1 − β, and ∂−

x ρu(x) is valid for any x ∈ (0, 1).
Therefore, we only need to verify that ρu satisﬁes the second condition in Lemma 1. By substituting ρu into Eq. (26), we
Ω < x ≤ x1, Lρu = −Ωδ < 0, (3) for x1 < x ≤ x2, Lρu =
obtain that, (1) for 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5−α
2 (Ω′ − Ω) < 0, and (4) for x2 < x ≤ 1 and ǫ small enough, Lρu = (2ρu − 1)(Ω′ − Ω) < 0.
ǫC + (2qu − 1)(∂xqu − Ω) < ǫC + δ
Therefore, ρu satisﬁes all the sufﬁcient conditions in Lemma 1, and hence is an upper solution of Eq. (26).

Ω , Lρu = 0, (2) for 0.5−α

x ρu(x) ≥ ∂+

Finally, from Lemma 3, we obtain that, for these special cases, i.e., for α < 0.5, β < 0.5, and α + β + Ω > 1, there exists a

W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution ρs of Eq. (26) which tends to f as ǫ → 0.

3. For cases α > 0.5, and 0.5 − Ω < β < 0.5

For these cases, the expression of f is as follows,

See Fig. 2c (solid line) for an example of f . The upper solution ρu of Eq. (26) is constructed through the following methods.

Let wu be the solution of the following ODE

Then ρu is given as follows,

4 + 0.5 + (1 − xq)Ω′ − Ω′2

We claim that ρu satisﬁes all the conditions in Lemma 3. Similar as the discussions in previous subsections, we only need to
verify that ρu satisﬁes the sufﬁcient conditions in Lemma 1. One can easily show that ρu(0) = wu(0) = α, ρu(1) = g(Ω′) >
1 − β, and ∂−
x ρu(x) is valid for any x ∈ (0, 1). Therefore, we only need to verify that ρu satisﬁes the second

2 (Ω′ − Ω) < 0, (3) for x2 < x ≤ 1, Lρu = (2ρu − 1)(Ω′ − Ω) < 0
x1 < x ≤ x2, Lρu = ǫC + (2qu − 1)(∂xqu − Ω) < ǫC + δ
if ǫ is small enough. Therefore, ρu satisﬁes all the sufﬁcient conditions in Lemma 1, and hence is an upper solution of Eq. (26).

Similar as the discussion for upper solution ρu, one can show that ρl satisﬁes the conditions in Lemma 1, and therefore is
2 + 1 − β < 1 − β, and

a lower solution of Eq. (26). In fact, one can verify that ρl(0) = − δ

x ρl(x) is valid for any x ∈ (0, 1). By substituting ρl into Eq.

(26), we obtain that, (1) for 0 ≤ x ≤ xq,

Meanwhile, let ˆρu = limǫ→0 ρu, then for δ small enough, ˆρu and ρl (note ρl is independent of ǫ) can be arbitrarily close to f .

At the same time, ρu > ˆρu > ρl is valid ∀ ǫ > 0 if Ω − Ω′ is small enough.

The above analysis shows that ρu and ρl satisfy all the conditions in Lemma 3, therefore, for these special cases, i.e., for

α > 0.5, and 0.5 − Ω < β < 0.5, there exists a W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution ρs of Eq. (26) which tends to f as ǫ → 0.

4. For cases α > β + Ω, β < 0.5 − Ω, α + β + Ω < 1

For these cases, the expression of f is as follows,

∂xwu = −[wu − (1 − β − Ω)][wu − (β + Ω)], wu(0) = α.

(55)

(56)

See Fig. 2d (dashed lines) for examples of ρu and ρl. One can easily verify that ρl(0) = wu(0) = α, and ρl(1) = wu(1) + Ω <
1 − β − Ω + Ω = 1 − β. By substituting ρl into Eq. (26), we have Lρl = 2Ωx∂xwu ≥ 0. Therefore, ρl satisﬁes the conditions
listed in Lemma 1, and is a lower solution of Eq. (26).

For these special cases, ρu is independent of ǫ, ˆρl = limǫ→0 ρl = f . For δ small enough, ρu can be arbitrarily close to f , and

ρu > ˆρl > ρl ∀ǫ > 0.

All the above analyses show that ρu and ρl satisfy the conditions in Lemma 3, therefore, for these special cases, i.e., for
α > β + Ω, β < 0.5 − Ω, and α + β + Ω < 1, there exists a W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution ρs of Eq. (26) which tends to f as ǫ → 0.

One can easily verify that ρu(0) = wu(0) = α, and ρu(1) = wu(1) + Ω > 1 − β − Ω + Ω = 1 − β. By substituting ρu into
Eq. (26), we obtain Lρu = 2Ωx∂xwu ≤ 0. Therefore, ρu satisﬁes the sufﬁcient conditions in Lemma 1, and is hence an upper
solution.

For these cases, ρl is independent of ǫ, and ˆρu = limǫ→0 ρu = f . For δ small enough, ρl can be arbitrarily close to f , and

ρu > ˆρu > ρl ∀ǫ > 0.

The above analyses show that ρu and ρl satisfy the conditions in Lemma 3, therefore, for these special cases, i.e., for α >

β + Ω, β < 0.5 − Ω, and α + β + Ω > 1, there exists a W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution ρs of Eq. (26) which tends to f as ǫ → 0.

6. For cases α > 0.5, and β > 0.5

that ρl is a lower solution of Eq. (26).

One can also verify that, for δ small enough, ˆρu = limǫ→0 ρu and ˆρl = limǫ→0 ρl can be close to f arbitrarily, and ρu >
ˆρu > ˆρl > ρl ∀ ǫ > 0. Therefore, the conditions in Lemma 3 are all satisﬁed. So, for these special cases, i.e., for α > 0.5, and
β > 0.5, there exists a W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution ρs of Eq. (26) which tends to f as ǫ → 0.

D. Construction of upper and lower weak solutions of Eq. (2): for general cases ΩA = KΩD with K > 1

For these general cases, we have

xρ + (2ρ − 1)∂xρ − (K + 1)ΩDρ + KΩD = 0,

Lρ = ǫ

2 ∂2
ρ(0) = α,

x ∈ (0, 1),

ρ(1) = 1 − β.




For convenience of the construction of f , ρu, and ρl, we give a function u which satisﬁes the following equation,

(2u − 1)∂xu − (K + 1)ΩDu + KΩD = 0.

(64)

(65)

It is easy to ﬁnd that 1/2 and K/(K + 1) are two critical points of u, and u has the following properties,

• With boundary condition u(0) < 1/2, u increases with x and exists in interval [0, x1), where u−(x1) = 1/2.

• With boundary condition 1/2 < u(0) < K/(K + 1), u decreases with x and exists in interval [0, x2), where u−(x2) =

1/2.

• With boundary condition u(1) ≥ K/(K + 1), u increases with x, and tends to K/(K + 1) as x → −∞.

The solution of Eq. (65) can be expressed implicitly as follows,

x + C =

2u

(K + 1)ΩD

+ (K − 1)

log |(K + 1)ΩDu − KΩD|

(K + 1)2ΩD

.

(66)

Where C is a constant determined by boundary condition.

In the following of this subsection, we will construct the upper solution ρu and the lower solution ρl of Eq. (64) for eleven
different cases, which include all the possible cases of Eq. (64), see the Table 1 in [7]. To describe the properties of the solution ρ
of Eq. (64) conveniently, we introduce the following acronym: BL+
l — which means that ρ has Boundary Layer at left boundary
x = 0, and in the boundary layer ρ increases (+) with x; Similarly, we have BL−
r ; LD— which means that
the solution ρ < 1/2, or physically the particle density is in Low Density phase; HD— which means that ρ > K/(K + 1),
or the particle density is in High Density phase; MD— which means that 1/2 < ρ < K/(K + 1), or the particle density is in
Medium Density phase; DW— which means that Domain Wall appears in interval (0, 1). Here, domain wall is the boundary of

r , and BL−

l , BL+

low density and high density (or medium density), i.e., at the left side of domain wall ρ < 1/2, while at the right side of domain
wall ρ > 1/2.

1. For cases LD+BL+
r

Let u0 be the solution of the following ODE,

(2u0 − 1)∂xu0 − (K + 1)ΩDu0 + KΩD = 0,

u0(0) = α.

If α < 1/2 and 1 − u0(1) > 1 − β > u0(1), then the limit solution f is (see Fig. 3a)

u0(x), x < 1,

1 − β, x = 1.

f (x) =


(67)

(68)

For these cases, the small ǫ limit of the solution ρ of Eq. (64) is in low density (LD) phase and has right boundary layer (BL+
r ).
The upper solution ρu for these cases can be given as follows,

17

where uδ satisﬁes

ρu = w + uδ − A,

(2uδ − 1)∂xuδ − (K + 1)Ω′

Duδ + KΩ′

D = 0,

uδ(0) = α + δ,

with constant Ω′

D > ΩD, and w satisﬁes

ǫ
2

∂xw = −(w − A)(w − (1 − A)), w(1) = 1 − β + δ2,

(69)

(70)

(71)

with constant A = δ1 +uδ(1). Where we assume δ1, δ2 satisfy δ1 < δ2, and uδ(1)+δ1 +δ2 < β (or equivalently 1−A > w(1)).

We claim that ρu satisﬁes the sufﬁcient conditions in Lemma 1. Substituting ρu into (64), and using Eqs. (70,71), we have

Lρu =

D
2uδ − 1

(w − A) + 2(uδ − A)∂xw + (Ω′

D − ΩD)((K + 1)(uδ + w − A) − K).

(72)

It can be veriﬁed that uδ and w are both increasing functions, so uδ(x) − A ≤ uδ(1) − A = −δ1 < 0, and ∂xw = − 2
A)(w − (1 − A)) ≥ 2

ǫ (1 − A − w(1))(w − A). From uδ(x) − A ≤ −δ1, we obtain that for ǫ small enough,

ǫ (w −

(w − A) − 2δ1

ǫ

(1 − A − w(1))(w − A) < 0.

(73)

For the other two terms in Eq. (72), we have the following two cases,

• If w ≤ 1

2 , then uδ + w − A = uδ + w − (δ1 + uδ(1)) = w − δ1 + (uδ − uδ(1)) < 1/2 − δ1. So (Ω′

D − ΩD)((K +

1)(uδ + w − A) − K) ≤ (Ω′

D − ΩD)((K + 1)(−δ1 + 1

2 ) − K) < 0. Since ∂2

xuδ is a bounded function, we have

ǫ
2

∂2
xuδ + (Ω′

D − ΩD)((K + 1)(uδ + w − A) − K) < 0,

(74)

for ǫ small enough.

• If w > 1

2 , then limǫ→0 ∂xw = limǫ→0 − 2

ǫ (w − A)(w − (1 − A)) ≥ limǫ→0

2

ǫ (1 − A − w(1))( 1

2 − A) → ∞. Since

uδ(x) − A ≤ −δ1, and other terms are bounded, we have

ǫ

xuδ −

(K − 1)Ω′

for ǫ small enough.

(w − A) + 2(uδ − A)∂xw + (Ω′

D − ΩD)((K + 1)(uδ + w − A) − K) < 0,

(75)

Therefore, Lρu < 0 holds for any case. Meanwhile, one can verify that ρu(0) = w(0) + uδ(0) − A > α + δ > α. ρu(1) =
w(1) + uδ(1) − A = δ2 − δ1 + (1 − β) > (1 − β). In summary, ρu satisﬁes all the conditions in Lemma 1, and thus is an upper
solution of Eq. (64).

The lower solution ρl can be given by the following ODE,

(2ρl − 1)∂xρl − (K + 1)ΩDρl + KΩD = 0, ρl(0) = α − δ.

Substituting ρl into Eq. (64), one can easily show that

Lρl =

ǫ
2

∂2
xρl > 0.

(76)

(77)

Meanwhile, ρl(0) = α − δ < α. ρl(1) < u0(1) < 1 − β. Thus, ρl satisﬁes all the conditions in Lemma 1, and is a lower solution
of Eq. (64).

Finally, for these cases, ρl is independent of parameter ǫ. For δ, δ2, Ω′ − Ω small enough, both ˆρu = limǫ→0 ρu and ρl can be
close to f arbitrarily, and ρu > ˆρu > ρl holds ∀ ǫ > 0. So the ﬁrst and third conditions in Lemma 3 are also satisﬁed. Then the
results of Lemma 3 give that there exists a W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution ρ of Eq. (64) which tends to f as ǫ → 0.

2. For cases LD+BL−
r

Similar to the previous subsection, let u0 be the solution of the following ODE,

(2u0 − 1)∂xu0 − (K + 1)ΩDu0 + KΩD = 0,

u0(0) = α.

If α < 1/2 and 1 − β < u0(1), then the limit solution f is (see Fig. 3b)

u0,

x < 1,

1 − β, x = 1.

f (x) =


(78)

(79)

For these cases, the small ǫ limit of the solution ρ of Eq. (64) is in low density (LD) phase and also has right boundary layer, but
ρ decreases in the boundary (BL−

r ). The upper solution ρu for these cases can be given as follows,

(2ρu − 1)∂xρu − (K + 1)Ω′

Dρu + KΩ′

D = 0,

ρu(0) = α + δ,

with Ω′

D > ΩD. By substituting ρu into Eq. (64), we ﬁnd that, for ǫ small enough,

Lρu =

ǫ
2

∂2
xρu + (Ω′

D − ΩD)((K + 1)ρu − K) < 0.

(80)

(81)

Meanwhile, one can easily show that ρu(0) = α + δ > α, and ρu(1) > u0(1) > 1 − β. Thus, ρu is an upper solution of Eq.
(64).

The lower solution ρl can be given by

Where u−δ is the solution of the following ODE

ρl = w + u−δ − A.

(2u−δ − 1)∂xu−δ − (K + 1)ΩDu−δ + KΩD = 0,

u−δ(0) = α − δ,

constant A = δ1 + u−δ(1), and w satisﬁes the following ODE,

ǫ
2

∂xw = −(w − A)(w − (1 − A)), w(1) = 1 − β.

(82)

(83)

(84)

Here, we assume A < u0(1) and u−δ(1) > 1 − β, which are correct when δ, δ1 are both small enough. In the following
discussion, we show that ρl satisﬁes the sufﬁcient conditions in Lemma 1. Substituting ρl into Eq. (64), and using Eqs. (83,84),
we have

Lρl =

ǫ
2

∂2
xu−δ −

(K − 1)ΩD
2u−δ − 1

(w − A) + 2(u−δ − A)∂xw.

(85)

Since u−δ is an increasing function in interval [0, 1], we have u−δ(x) − A ≤ u−δ(1) − A = −δ1 < 0. At the same time,
∂xw = − 2

ǫ (1 − 2A)(w − A). Therefore, for ǫ small enough, we have

ǫ (w − A)(w − (1 − A)) ≤ 2

(K − 1)ΩD
2u−δ − 1

(w − A) + 2(u−δ − A)∂xw ≥ −

(w − A) − 2δ1

ǫ

(1 − 2A)(w − A) > 0.

(86)

19

xu−δ > 0, we have Lρl > 0. One can also easily show that ρl(0) = w(0) + u−δ(0) − A < α − δ < α. ρl(1) =

2 ∂2

Since ǫ
w(1) + u−δ(1) − A < 1 − β. Thus, ρl is a lower solution of Eq. (64).

For these cases, ρu is independent of ǫ. For δ, Ω′ − Ω small enough, ˆρl = limǫ→0 ρl and ρu can be arbitrarily close to f , and
ρu > ˆρl > ρl ∀ǫ > 0. So the ﬁrst and third conditions in Lemma 3 are also satisﬁed. Hence the existence of solution ρ of Eq.
(64) is obtained from Lemma 3.

3. For cases BL+

l +HD

Let u0 be the solution of the following ODE,

(2u0 − 1)∂xu0 − (K + 1)ΩDu0 + KΩD,

u0(1) = 1 − β.

If 1 − β > K/(K + 1) and 1 − u0(0) < α < u0(0), then the limit solution f is (see Fig. 3c)

α, x = 0,

u0, 0 < x ≤ 1.

f (x) =


(87)

(88)

For these cases, the small ǫ limit solution ρ of Eq. (64) is in high density (HD) phase and has left boundary layer, but ρ increases
in the left boundary layer (BL+

l ). The upper solution ρu can be given by the following ODE,

(2ρu − 1)∂xρu − (K + 1)Ω′

Dρu + KΩ′

D = 0,

ρu(1) = 1 − β + δ,

where Ω′

D < ΩD is a constant. By substituting ρu into Eq. (64), we have that, for ǫ small enough,

Lρu =

ǫ
2

∂2
xρu + (Ω′

D − ΩD)((K + 1)ρu − K) < 0.

(89)

(90)

Meanwhile, one can verify that ρu(0) > u0(0) > α. ρu(1) = 1 − β + δ > 1 − β. Thus, ρu satisﬁes the sufﬁcient conditions in
Lemma 1, and therefore is an upper solution of Eq. (64).

The lower solution ρl can be given by

Where u−δ is the solution of

ρl = w + u−δ − A.

(2u−δ − 1)∂xu−δ − (K + 1)ΩDu−δ + KΩD = 0, u−δ(1) = 1 − β − δ,

constant A = −δ1 + u−δ(0), and w is the solution of

ǫ
2

∂xw = −(w − A)(w − (1 − A)), w(0) = α − δ2.

Here we assume δ1 < δ2 and w(0) > 1 − A, which will be satisﬁed if δ, δ1, δ2 are small enough.

(91)

(92)

(93)

Substituting ρl into (64), and using Eqs. (92,93), we have

Lρl =

ǫ
2

∂2
xu−δ −

(K − 1)ΩD
2u−δ − 1

(w − A) + 2(u−δ − A)∂xw.

20

(94)

Since u−δ is an increasing function, we have u−δ(x) − A ≥ u−δ(0) − A = δ1 > 0. Meanwhile, one can show that
− (K−1)ΩD

2u−δ −1 (w − A) > 0, ∂xw > 0, and ǫ

xu−δ > 0. So

2 ∂2

ǫ
2

∂2
xu−δ −

(K − 1)ΩD
2u−δ − 1

(w − A) + 2(u−δ − A)∂xw > 0.

(95)

At the same time, ρl(0) = w(0) + u−δ(0) − A = α + δ1 − δ2 < α, and ρl(1) = w(1) + u−δ(1) − A < 1 − β − δ < 1 − β.
Thus, ρl satisﬁes the sufﬁcient conditions in Lemma 1, and consequently, is a lower solution of Eq. (64).

For these cases, ρu is independent of ǫ. For δ, δ2, Ω − Ω′ small enough, ˆρl = limǫ→0 ρl and ρu can be close to f arbitrarily,
and ρu > ˆρl > ρl ∀ǫ > 0. So the ﬁrst and third conditions in Lemma 3 are also satisﬁed. Hence the existence of solution ρ of
Eq. (64) is obtained.

4. For cases BL−

l +HD

Let u0 be the solution of the following ODE,

(2u0 − 1)∂xu0 − (K + 1)ΩDu0 + KΩD = 0, u0(1) = 1 − β.

If 1 − β > K/(K + 1) and α > u0(0), the limit solution f is (see Fig. 3d)

α, x = 0,

u0, 0 < x ≤ 1.

f (x) =


(96)

(97)

For these cases, the small ǫ limit solution of Eq. (64) is in high density (HD) phase, and has left boundary, but ρ decreases in the
boundary layer. The upper solution ρu can be given as follows,

Where uδ is the solution of the following ODE,

ρu = w + uδ − A.

(2uδ − 1)∂xuδ − (K + 1)Ω′

Duδ + KΩ′

D = 0,

uδ(1) = 1 − β + δ,

constant A = −δ1 + uδ(0), and w satisﬁes

ǫ
2

∂xw = −(w − A)(w − (1 − A)), w(0) = α.

Here we assume Ω′

D < ΩD, and A < α. The latter can be satisﬁed if δ is small enough.

Substituting ρu into (64), and using Eqs. (99,100), we have

(98)

(99)

(100)

Lρu =

ǫ
2

∂2
xuδ −

(K − 1)Ω′
D
2uδ − 1

(w − A) + 2(uδ − A)∂xw + (Ω′

D − ΩD)((K + 1)(uδ + w − A) − K).

(101)

Since uδ is an increasing function, uδ(x)−A ≥ uδ(0)−A = δ1 > 0. Meanwhile, one can easily show that − (K−1)Ω′
0, ∂xw < 0, and (Ω′

D − ΩD)((K + 1)(uδ + w − A) − K) < 0. Therefore, for ǫ small enough,

2uδ −1 (w−A) <

Lρu =

xuδ −

(K − 1)Ω′
D
2uδ − 1

(w − A) + 2(uδ − A)∂xw + (Ω′

D − ΩD)((K + 1)(uδ + w − A) − K) < 0.

(102)

At the same time, ρu(0) = w(0) + uδ(0) − A > α + δ1 > α. ρu(1) = w(1) + uδ(1) − A > uδ(1) = δ + (1 − β) > (1 − β).
Thus, ρu satisﬁes the sufﬁcient conditions in Lemma 1, and hence is an upper solution of Eq. (64).

The lower solution ρl can be obtained by the following ODE,

(2ρl − 1)∂xρl − (K + 1)ΩDρl + KΩD = 0, ρl(1) = 1 − β − δ.

(103)

21

Substituting ρl into Eq. (64), we have Lρl = ǫ
Thus, ρl is a lower solution of Eq. (64).

2 ∂2

xρl > 0. Meanwhile, ρl(0) < u0(0) < α, and ρl(1) = 1 − β − δ < 1 − β.

For these cases, ρl is independent of ǫ. For δ, Ω − Ω′ small enough, ˆρu = limǫ→0 ρu and ρl can be close to f arbitrarily, and
ρu > ˆρu > ρl ∀ǫ > 0. So the ﬁrst and third conditions in Lemma 3 are also satisﬁed. Hence the existence of solution ρ of Eq.
(64) is obtained.

Let u0 be the solution of the following ODE,

5. For cases BL+

l +MD

(2u0 − 1)∂xu0 − (K + 1)ΩDu0 + KΩD = 0,

u0(1) = 1 − β.

If 1

2 < 1 − β < K

K+1 and 1 − u0(0) < α < u0(0), the limit solution f is (see Fig. 3e)

α, x = 0,

u0, 0 < x ≤ 1.

f (x) =


(104)

(105)

For these cases, the small ǫ limit solution ρ of Eq. (64) is in medium density (MD) phase, and has left boundary layer (BL+
l ).
The upper solution ρu can be given by the following equation,

(2ρu − 1)∂xρu − (K + 1)ΩDρu + KΩD = 0, ρu(1) = 1 − β + δ.

(106)

Substituting ρu into Eq. (64), we have Lρu = ǫ
Thus, ρu satisﬁes the sufﬁcient conditions in Lemma 1, and is an upper solution.

2 ∂2

xρu < 0. Meanwhile, ρu(0) > u0(0) > α, and ρu(1) = 1 − β + δ > 1 − β.

The lower solution ρl can be given by

Where u−δ is the solution of the following ODE

ρl = w + u−δ − A.

(2u−δ − 1)∂xu−δ − (K + 1)Ω′

Du−δ + KΩ′

D = 0,

u−δ(1) = 1 − β − δ,

with constant Ω′

D < ΩD, A = −δ1 + u−δ(0), and w satisﬁes

ǫ
2

∂xw = −(w − A)(w − (1 − A)), w(0) = α − δ2.

(107)

(108)

(109)

Here we assume δ1 < δ2 and w(0) > 1 − A, which can be satisﬁed if δ, δ1, δ2, ΩD − Ω′

D are small enough.

Substituting ρl into (64), and using Eqs. (108,109), we have

Lρl =

2u−δ − 1

(w − A) + 2(u−δ − A)∂xw + (Ω′

D − ΩD)((K + 1)(u−δ + w − A) − K).

(110)

Since u−δ(0) − A = δ1 > 0, there exists a constant δ3 > 0, which is independent of ǫ, such that u−δ(x) − A > 0 for x < δ3.
Meanwhile, for x ≥ δ3, ∂xw → 0 uniformly (see subsection III B, together with the monotonicity of ∂xw), and one can verify

22

thath− (K−1)ΩD

2u−δ −1 (w − A)i > 0, ∂xw > 0, (Ω′

D − ΩD)((K + 1)(u−δ + w − A) − K) > 0. Therefore, for ǫ small enough,

(111)

At the same time, ρl(0) = w(0) + u−δ(0) − A = α + δ1 − δ2 < α, ρl(1) = w(1) + u−δ(1) − A < 1 − β − δ < 1 − β. Thus,
ρl satisﬁes the sufﬁcient conditions in Lemma 1, and is a lower solution of Eq. (64).

For these cases, ρu is independent of ǫ. For δ, δ2, Ω − Ω′ small enough, ˆρl = limǫ→0 ρl and ρu can be close to f arbitrarily,
and ρu > ˆρl > ρl ∀ǫ > 0. So the ﬁrst and third conditions in Lemma 3 are also satisﬁed. Hence the existence of solution ρ of
Eq. (64) is obtained.

Let u0 be the solution of the following ODE,

6. For cases BL−

(2u0 − 1)∂xu0 − (K + 1)ΩDu0 + KΩD = 0,

u0(1) = 1 − β.

For these cases, the small ǫ limit solution ρ of Eq. (64) is in medium density (MD) phase, and has left boundary layer (BL−

The upper solution ρu can be given by the following equation,

Where uδ is the solution of the following ODE,

ρu = w + uδ − A.

(2uδ − 1)∂xuδ − (K + 1)ΩDuδ + KΩD = 0,

uδ(1) = 1 − β + δ,

constant A = u0(1), and w is the solution of the following ODE,

ǫ
2

∂xw = −(w − A)(w − (1 − A)), w(0) = A + α − uδ(0).

2uδ − 1

(w − A) + 2(uδ − A)∂xw.

Since uδ is a decreasing function, uδ(x)−A ≥ uδ(1)−A = uδ(1)−u0(1) = δ > 0. One can verify that − (K−1)ΩD

Meanwhile, ρu(0) = w(0)+ uδ(0)− A = A+ α− uδ(0)+ uδ(0)− A = α, ρu(1) = w(1)+ uδ(1)− A > uδ(1) = δ + (1 − β) >

Meanwhile, ρl(0) < u0(0) < α, and ρl(1) = 1 − β − δ < 1 − β. Thus, ρl satisﬁes the sufﬁcient conditions in Lemma 1, and is
a lower solution of Eq. (64).

For these cases, ρl is independent of ǫ. For δ, Ω − Ω′ small enough, ˆρu = limǫ→0 ρu and ρl can be close to f arbitrarily, and
ρu > ˆρu > ρl ∀ǫ > 0. So the ﬁrst and third conditions in Lemma 3 are also satisﬁed. Hence the existence of solution ρ of Eq.
(64) is obtained.

−δ(0) − A − 0.5 < α − δ4 + δ3 < α. ρl(1) = w(1) + w1(1) + uǫ

For these cases, ρu is independent of ǫ. For δ, δ1, δ2, δ4, and Ω − Ω′ small enough, ˆρl = limǫ→0 ρl and ρu can be close to
f arbitrarily, and ρu > ˆρl if δ3 < δ4. Thus, for ǫ small enough, ρu > ρl. So the ﬁrst and third conditions in Lemma 3 are also
satisﬁed. Hence the existence of solution ρ of Eq. (64) is obtained.

Deﬁne ˆρl = limǫ→0 ρl, ˆρu = limǫ→0 ρu. For δ, δ1, δ2, Ω − Ω′ small enough, ˆρl and ˆρu can be arbitrarily close to f , and
ρu > ˆρu > ˆρl. Thus, for ǫ small enough, ρu > ρl. Which implies that the ﬁrst and third conditions in Lemma 3 are also satisﬁed.
Hence the existence of solution ρ of Eq. (64) is obtained.

One can verify that for ǫ small enough, w2(1)−(1−A2)+u4ǫ

Thus, for ǫ small enough, ∂−

0(0) = α, and ρl(1) = w2(1) − (1 − A2) + u4ǫ

x ρl(x−δ). Meanwhile, it can also be shown that, for ǫ small enough, ρl(0) =
2 → 1 − β − δ2 < 1 − β. Thus, ρl

−δ(1) + w3(1) − 1

x ρl(x−δ) < ∂+

−δ(0) < u1

Since too many parameters are used in this subsection, for convenience, we summarize their logical relationships below.

• δ, Ω′′′′ < Ω, δ2 are chosen independently at ﬁrst.

• δ1, Ω′ > Ω are chosen based on δ such that u3

δ > u1

0.
δ > u2

• Ω′′′′ < Ω′′′ < Ω, δ5 are chosen based on δ and Ω′′′′ < Ω such that

3 = −δ5 + u5

−δ(x−δ) − (1 − A2) > 0.

(275)

At the same time, δ3 is required to be small enough. Upon this small δ3, as well as δ and Ω′′′′ < Ω, we further choose
Ω′′ < Ω such that u3ǫ

0.
−δ < u1

Finally, for δ, Ω−Ω′′′′, δ2 small enough (note that δ5, Ω−Ω′′′ are controlled by Ω−Ω′′′′), ˆρl = limǫ→0 ρl and ˆρu = limǫ→0 ρu
can be arbitrarily close to f . Meanwhile, for ǫ small enough, ρu > ρl if δ1, Ω′ − Ω, Ω − Ω′′, and δ3 are also small enough. We
can make δ3 small through choosing suitable Ω′′′ − Ω′′′′ and δ5. Therefore, the ﬁrst and third conditions in Lemma 3 are also
satisﬁed, and hence the existence of solution ρ of Eq. (64) is obtained.

E. Regularity of the W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution

The discussions in Section III C and Section III D show that there exists at least one weak solution in space W 1,2(0, 1) for Eq.
(2), or equivalently Eqs. (26,64), see Lemma 3. Here, we want to show that the weak solution in space W 1,2(0, 1) is actually in
space C∞[0, 1].

Theorem 2. Any W 1,2(0, 1) weak solution ρ of Eq. (2) is actually in space C∞[0, 1].

Proof. This can be proved inductively. If ρ is a solution of Eq. (2) in W n,2(0, 1) space (n ≥ 1), we have

ǫ
2

ρxx = −(2ρ − 1)ρx − ΩA(1 − ρ) + ΩDρ.

39

(276)

Note that ρρx is in W n−1,2(0, 1) space (see Theorem 7.4 in [28]). Thus, the righthand side of the above equation belongs to
W n−1,2(0, 1) space, thereby ǫ
2 ρxx ∈ W n−1,2(0, 1), which implies ρ ∈ W n+1,2(0, 1). So ρ ∈ W k,2(0, 1) for all k > 0, and
consequently ρ ∈ C∞[0, 1]. See Section 7.7 in [28] for more details.

IV. UNIQUENESS OF THE STEADY STATE SOLUTION IN SPACE C 1[0, 1] (OR IN SPACE W 1,2(0, 1))

The uniqueness of the steady state solution, i.e., the solution of Eq. (2), in space C1[0, 1] can be proved by using the Theorem

10.7 in [28], which is a generalization of the classical linear maximum principle to the quasi-linear cases.

Theorem 3. The C1[0, 1] solution of Eq. (2), if exists, is unique.

Proof. Let K = ΩA/ΩD, A(ρ, ρx) = ǫρx/2 + ρ2 − ρ, and B(ρ) = −(K + 1)ΩDρ + KΩD. Then Eq. (2) can be written as
follows,

Suppose both ρ0 and ρ1 are C1[0, 1] solutions of Eq. (2). Deﬁne g = ρ1 − ρ0, and let

[A(ρ, ρx)]x + B(ρ) = 0.

Then for any function ϕ in W 1,2

0

(0, 1) space, we have

ρt = tρ1 + (1 − t)ρ0.

Note that

Theorem 3 gives the uniqueness of solution of Eq. (2) in C1[0, 1] space. In fact, this can be generalized to the uniqueness in
W 1,2(0, 1) space. From Theorem 2, we can know that for any two solutions ρa and ρb of Eq. (2) in W 1,2(0, 1) space, we have
ρa, ρb ∈ C∞[0, 1] ⊂ C1[0, 1]. Then from Theorem 3, we have ρa = ρb.

In the ﬁrst part of this section, the existence of solution of Eq. (2) in W 1,2(0, 1) space has already been given by the method
of upper and lower solution. So together with the discussion of uniqueness in this subsection, we have obtained that the Eq. (2),

which describes the steady state density of particles along the underline track in TASEP process, has a unique W 1,2(0, 1) weak

solution, which actually belongs to C∞[0, 1].

V. THE EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS OF THE GLOBAL X α SOLUTION, AS WELL AS THE EXISTENCE OF GLOBAL

ATTRACTOR IN X α

In this section, we will show the global existence and uniqueness of solution of the time dependent Eq.

(1), as well as

the existence of global attractor in a space of certain type functions. Let V be a metric space. The one parameter family
{(T (t))} : V → V , t > 0 is a C0 semigroup (see Deﬁnition 1.1.1 of [16]). By a global attractor for {T (t)}, we mean a
nonempty, compact, {T (t)}-invariant set A ⊂ V which attracts every bounded subset of V (see Deﬁnition 1.1.4 of [16]). Here,

V is the function space X α deﬁned below, and for ρ(x, s) ∈ X α, Eq. (1) deﬁnes a C0 semigroup by T (t)ρ(x, s) = ρ(x, t + s),
where ρ(x, s) will evolve to ρ(x, t + s) according to Eq. (1).

Let ρs be the unique solution of Eq. (2) in C∞[0, 1] space, ρ be a solution of Eq. (1) with initial value ρ0(x). Then g = ρ − ρs

satisﬁes the following equation,

2 gxx + [g2 + g(2ρs − 1)]x − (K + 1)ΩDg,

for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1,



where K = ΩA/ΩD and g0 = ρ0 − ρs. Due to the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, we will discuss the speciﬁc
type solution g of Eq. (288). Then ρ = g + ρs will be the corresponding solution of Eq. (1).

Deﬁne A(g) = − ǫ

2 gxx + λ0g, F (g, gx) = [g2 + g(2ρs − 1)]x − (K + 1)ΩDg + λ0g with λ0 > 0 a positive constant. Then

Eq. (288) can be reformulated into the following form,

41

ǫ gt = −A(g) + F (g, gx),
g(0, t) = 0, g(1, t) = 0,

for t > 0 and 0 < x < 1,
for t > 0,

g(x, 0) = g0,

for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.

Following the idea used in chapter 5 of [16], we have

• The operator A(g), the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, and the domain (0, 1) form a regular elliptic boundary

(292)

Regard A as operator from space W 2,2
(0, 1) to space L2(0, 1), and denote its spectrum set by σ(A). According to the example
1.3.8 in section 1.3 of [16], we know that A is sectorial (see deﬁnition 1.3.1 of [16]) and Reσ(A) > 0 if λ0 > 0 is chosen to be
large enough. Now we deﬁne A−α : L2 → L2 as

A−αv =

(293)

The proposition 1.3.4 in section 1.3 of [16] gives that A−α, α ∈ (0, +∞), are well deﬁned linear bounded operators on
X = L2(0, 1) giving a one-to-one correspondence between L2 and the range R(A−α). Deﬁne Aα as the inverse of A−α, and
X α := R(A−α) as the domain of deﬁnition of Aα. Specially, A−1 is consistent with the inverse of A, and X 1 = W 2,2
(0, 1).
For convenience, we deﬁne A0 = I, and X 0 = X = L2(0, 1).

According to discussions from page 47 to page 50, especially the Remark 1.3.7, in section 1.3 of [16], we have

Similar to the deﬁnition 2.1.1 of [16], the local X α solution of Eq. (289) for α ∈ [0, 1) is deﬁned as follows.

Deﬁnition 2. Let α ∈ [0, 1) and g0 ∈ X α. If, for some real τ > 0, a function g ∈ C([0, τ ), X α) satisﬁes the following
conditions,

• g(x, 0) = g0(x),

• g ∈ C1((0, τ ), X),

• g(x, t) belongs to X 1 for each t ∈ (0, τ ),

• 1

ǫ gt = −A(g) + F (g, gx) holds in X ∀t ∈ (0, τ ),

42

then g is called a local X α solution of Eq. (289). Note that the boundary condition is satisﬁed naturally since g(x, t) ∈ X 1 =
W 2,2

for each t ∈ (0, τ ). If τ = +∞, such a solution is call a global X α solution.

0

According to the discussion in section 9.4 of [16], the X α solution g has the following regularity.

g ∈ C([0, τ ), X α) ∩ C1((0, τ ), X γ) ∩ C((0, τ ), X 1), ∀γ ∈ [0, 1).

(295)

In the following, based on the theory presented in [16], we will prove the global existence and uniqueness of the solution of

Eq. (289), as well as the existence of its global attractor, in X α space with α > 3
4 .

Firstly, we show that F (g, gx), as an operator from X α to X, is Lipschitz continuous on bounded sets of X α for α > 3

4 . Since
2α − 1 > 1/2, we have X α = W 2α,2(0, 1) ⊂ C1[0, 1] according to Sobolev imbedding theorem (see Section 7.7 in [28]). So
an element g in space X α being bounded means that there exists a constant C0 > 0 such that |g|, |gx| ≤ C0. For two elements
g1 and g2, which belong to a bounded subset of X α, we have

kF (g1, (g1)x) − F (g2, (g2)x)kX = kF (g1, (g1)x) − F (g2, (g2)x)k2

(296)

= k(g1 − g2)(2ρs − 1)x + (g1 − g2)x(2ρs − 1) + 2g1(g1)x − 2g2(g2)x − (K + 1)ΩD(g1 − g2) + λ0(g1 − g2)k2(297)

≤ C1kg1 − g2kW 1,2(0,1) ≤ C2kg1 − g2kX α.

(298)

(299)

(300)

(301)

Secondly, we discuss a growth condition of F (g, gx) (see Eq. (302) below). Choose 1 ≤ γ0 < 5, 1 ≤ γ1 < 5
+ 1
γ1

= 1. Since ρs ∈ C∞[0, 1], we have kρsk∞ < +∞. So from Young’s inequality (see Lemma 1.2.2 in [16]), we have

|F (g, gx)| = |[g2 + g(2ρs − 1)]x − (K + 1)ΩDg + λ0g| ≤ M1|ggx| + M2|g| + M3|gx|

Thirdly, we give an L2(0, 1) priori estimate of g(·, t), which is asymptotically independent of the initial condition g0. Multi-

0 f1gtg+dx for t > 0. According to Eq.
(295), g ∈ C1((0, ∞), X γ) for any γ ∈ [0, 1). Remind that X γ = W 2γ,2(0, 1) ⊂ C0[0, 1] for γ ∈ (1/4, 1). Thus, the following

two conditions are satisﬁed.

• ∀ t > 0, limh→0 g(x, t + h) = g(x, t) uniformly for x ∈ [0, 1]. Note that 3

4 < α < 1. This is also true for t = 0 since

g ∈ C([0, ∞), X α) ⊂ C([0, ∞), C1[0, 1]).

• ∀ t > 0, limh→0

Theorem 4. Under the above two conditions, 1

Proof. One can easily show that |g+(x, t + h) − g+(x, t)| ≤ |g(x, t + h) − g(x, t)|. So from the ﬁrst condition we can
know that limh→0 g+(x, t + h) = g+(x, t) uniformly for x ∈ [0, 1].
[g+(x,t+h)]2−[g+(x,t)]2

In the following discussion, we want to show that

converges to 2gt(x, t)g+(x, t) pointwise. Obviously, we have

We illustrate the convergence through the following two cases. (1) If g(x, t) ≤ 0, then limh→0 g+(x, t + h) = g+(x, t) = 0.
g+(x,t+h)−g+(x,t)
Since |g+(x, t+ h)− g+(x, t)| ≤ |g(x, t+ h)− g(x, t)|, and limh→0
is bounded. So from Eq. (319), we obtain

= gt(x, t) exists, limh→0

h

lim
h→0

= 0 = 2gt(x, t)g+(x, t).

(320)

Which is right for any x such that g(x, t) ≤ 0. (2) If g(x, t) > 0, then there exists h0(x, t) > 0 such that ∀ |h| < h0(x, t),
|g(x + h, t) − g(x, t)| < g(x, t). So g(x + h, t) > 0, and g+(x + h, t) = g(x + h, t). Thus, we have

[g+(x, t + h)]2 − [g+(x, t)]2

h

= lim
h→0

[g(x, t + h)]2 − [g(x, t)]2

h

lim
h→0

= 2gt(x, t)g(x, t) = 2gt(x, t)g+(x, t).

(321)

Which is right for any x such that g(x, t) > 0.

In order to use the dominated convergence theorem, we need to show that maxx∈[0,1] | [g+(x,t+h)]2−[g+(x,t)]2

| is uniformly
bounded with respect to h. From the two conditions of this Theorem, we know that limh→0
= gt(x, t) uniformly
for x ∈ [0, 1], and gt(x, t) ∈ X γ ⊂ C0[0, 1] is uniformly bounded with respect to x. So maxx∈[0,1] | g(x,t+h)−g(x,t)
| is uniformly
bounded with respect to h. Since |g+(x, t + h) − g+(x, t)| ≤ |g(x, t + h) − g(x, t)|, maxx∈[0,1] | g+(x,t+h)−g+(x,t)
| is also
uniformly bounded with respect to h. Similarly, we can know that maxx∈[0,1] |g+(x, t + h)| is uniformly bounded with respect
to h, since limh→0 g(x, t + h) = g(x, t) uniformly for x ∈ [0, 1], g(x, t) ∈ X α ⊂ C1[0, 1] is uniformly bounded with respect to
x, and |g+(x, t + h)| ≤ |g(x, t + h)|. Therefore, from Eq. (319) we obtain that maxx∈[0,1] | [g+(x,t+h)]2−[g+(x,t)]2
| is uniformly
bounded with respect to h. Then from the dominated convergence theorem, we have

With the above preparation, we ﬁnally have the following result.

Theorem 5. For α ∈ (3/4, 1), Eq. (289) has a unique global X β solution g for any initial value g0 ∈ X β, as well as a global
attractor in X β, where β ∈ [α, 1). Therefore, for any initial value ρ0 satisfying ρ0 ∈ X β, Eq. (1) has a unique global X β
solution ρ, as well as a global attractor in X β.

46

Proof. We only need to illustrate the results for Eq. (289). Firstly, note that A is sectorial and Reσ(A) > 0, F (g, gx), as an
operator from X α to X, is Lipschitz continuous on bounded sets of X α for α > 3
4 . Then according to the Theorem 2.1.1 of
[16], Eq. (289) has a unique local X β solution g for any g0 ∈ X β.

Secondly, F (g, gx) satisﬁes the growth condition presented in Eq. (302), and g has the L2 estimation as presented in Eq.
(331). Then according to the Lemma 5.2.1, the Proposition 5.2.1, and the Remark 5.2.3 of [16], Eq. (289) has a unique global
X β solution g for any g0 ∈ X β.

Finally, g has the L2 estimation as presented in Eq. (333). Then according to the Theorem 5.3.1 and the Remark 5.3.1 of [16],

Eq. (289) has a global attractor in X β.

According to the Proposition 9.4.2 of [16], the unique solution of Eq. (1) is in fact a classical solution. Which means all

derivatives in Eq. (1) are actually classical derivatives.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND REMARKS

This paper is devoted to the analysis of an initial value parabolic problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions as given in Eq.

(1). Which originates from the description of the continuum limit of TASEP-LK coupled process. The phase diagram of its

steady state, which can be obtained from Eq. (2), is biophysically very important to understand corresponding both macroscopic

and microscopic biological processes, and has previously been extensively studied by Monte Carlo simulations and numerical

computations. The main task of this paper is to study the properties of Eqs. (1,2) mathematically, including their existence of

solutions and the stability of the steady state solution. By using the methods of upper and lower solutions, we ﬁnally obtained the
following conclusions. (1) There exists a weak solution of Eq. (2) in W 1,2(0, 1) space, which has the same phase diagram as the
one obtained by Monte Carlo simulations and numerical computations. Furthermore, this weak solution is actually a classical
one, and lies in C∞[0, 1] space. (2) The weak solution of Eq. (2) is unique in space W 1,2(0, 1). (3) For the time dependent
equation (1), we have also obtained its global existence and uniqueness of solution in a speciﬁc space X β, with β ∈ [α, 1) and

α ∈ (3/4, 1).

Finally, we want to point out that the Eqs.

(1,2) which we have studied in this paper are from the simplest case of the

TASEP-LK coupled process. In which particles travel along only one one-dimensional track and during each forward stepping

process, particles have only one internal biochemical or biophysical state. Meanwhile, it is also assumed that all particles are

from the same species, and therefore have the same properties, including their speed, attachment and detachment rates, initiation

rate and termination rate etc. In the ﬁeld of biology and physics, there are actually many general cases. For examples, all the

particles may travel along one closed orbit, particles may have different travel speed at different domains of the track, particles

may include multiple internal states, and particles may also be allowed to switch between different tracks. Moreover, recent

experiments showed that particles from different species may travel along the same track. Although for many of the above

mentioned general TASEP-LK coupled processes, rich biophysical properties have been obtained by Monte Carlo simulations

and numerical computations, almost no mathematical analysis has been carried out to show if there are any more properties

about the corresponding differential equations, or mathematically prove that if the numerically found results are reasonable.

In the future, we hope the methods used in this paper can be generalized to analyze the general cases, or more sophisticated

mathematical methods can be presented to make the analysis more efﬁcient and more powerful.

FIG. 1: Left. A diagram to illustrate the TASEP-LK coupled process with N binding sites. Particles move from left to right along a one-
dimensional lattice and exclude with each other. Particles can bind to the leftmost site 1 with rate α providing it is unoccupied, and particles

at the rightmost site N will leave the lattice with rate β. Particles at site i will hop forward to site i + 1 if site i + 1 is vacancy. The Langmuir

kinetics (LK) means that particles can detach from the main body of the lattice with rate ωD, and can attach to any of the internal sites
2 ≤ i ≤ N − 1 with rate ωA providing it is vacancy, see [4, 7] for more details. Right. Splitting of parameter space as discussed in Subsection
III C. The parameter domains labeled by ‘(i)’ are the cases discussed in Subsection III C(i), while the parameter domains labeled by ‘(i’)’ are

the symmetric cases of those labeled by ‘(i)’ (through particle-hole symmetry).
