We deﬁne the theoretical framework and deduce the conditions under which multi-
messenger astronomy can constrain neutrino masses and unveil their ordering. The frame-
work uses time diﬀerences between the arrival of neutrinos and the other two light mes-
sengers, i.e. light and gravitons, emitted in astrophysical catastrophes. We argue that it is
possible to decrease the upper bound on the absolute mass of the lightest neutrino to less
than about 0.02 eV for astrophysical sources at around 10 Mpc and with neutrino energies
of about 5 MeV. We also show that the potential observation of neutrinos from astrophysical
sources located at distances of hundreds of mega parsec similar to the one discovered by
the LIGO collaboration [1] leads to stronger constraints on neutrino properties.

INTRODUCTION

The fascinating discovery by the LIGO collab-
oration [1] of ripples in the fabric of space-time
—the gravitational waves, ﬁrst anticipated by A.
Einstein a century ago— shows us a completely
new way of exploring the Universe. Gravita-
tional waves (GW)s carry detailed information
about astrophysical catastrophes and can provide
a clear reference time for multi-messenger astron-
omy. In the next decade we therefore expect great
advances from the experimental particle physics
searches, on Earth and in space.
It is therefore timely to ask whether it is possi-
ble to use these new extraordinary experimental
achievements as new tools to help settling some
of the open issues in particle physics.
We know that the Standard Model (SM) cannot
be the ultimate theory of Nature since the neu-
trino sector and dark matter are not yet properly
accounted for.
In fact, the nature of the three
light active neutrinos νi (i = 1, 2, 3) with deﬁnite
mass mi is unknown. To date, neutrinos can still
be Dirac fermions if particle interactions conserve
some additive lepton number, e.g. the total lepton
charge L = Le + Lµ + Lτ. If however, the total lep-
ton charge is violated they can have a Majorana
nature [2, 3]. The only feasible experiment, so far,

that can unveil the nature of massive neutrinos is
neutrinoless double beta, (ββ)0ν decay (see e.g. [4]
for a review). The so called see-saw mechanism
[5] gives an appealing explanation of the small-
ness of neutrino masses, through the existence of
heavier fermionic SM singlets. It can also serve as
stepping stone for an explanation of the observed
baryon asymmetry in the universe through lepto-
genesis [6].
Active neutrinos are light, but how light are they?
This is arguably a most pressing question to an-
swer along with their nature and origin. Experi-
mental evidence of neutrino oscillations, and thus
the existence of at least three neutrino states, force
us to include them in the SM and give them tiny
mass diﬀerences [7]. That their masses are tiny,
when compared to other SM particles, comes from
cosmology where an upper bound on the sum of
i mi < 0.23 eV can be estab-
lished [8]. The enormous disparity between the
neutrino masses and the ones of the charged lep-
tons and quarks suggests that the neutrino masses
might be related to the existence of a new funda-
mental mass scale in particle physics, associated
with the existence of new physics beyond that
predicted by the SM.
The detection of GW150914 [1] has already ig-
nited the experimental neutrino community (see
e.g. the null search results of ANTARES and ICE-
CUBE [9]). The next-generation kilometer-scale
laser-interferometric GW detectors such as aLIGO

are believed to follow this pattern. We will adopt
and extend the notation of [14]. The diﬀerence
of the arrival times between the GWs and neu-
trinos, τobs ≡ tν − tg, or the GW and a photon,
≡ tγ − tg, are both observables, which can be
τγ
obs
positive or negative for an early or late arrival of
a GW. Typically the emission time of the three sig-
nals (GW, γ and ν) do not coincide. For instance in
the supernova explosion SN1987A [15], the neu-
trinos arrived approximately 2 – 3 hours before
the associated photons.
Let us assume now that a neutrino is emitted at
tE
ν = tE
int and detected at time tν. A relativistic
mass eigenstate neutrino with mass mi c2 (cid:28) E (
i = 1, 2, 3 ) propagates with a group velocity:

[10], aVIRGO [11], and KAGRA [12] will have
strong impact on multi-messenger astronomy.
The goal of this work is to investigate whether ex-
periments, making use of GW detection in com-
bination with associated photon and neutrino de-
tections, can make a dent in understanding the
ordering of neutrino masses.
Current experiments cannot yet decide on the
neutrino mass ordering while their absolute mass
is constrained by cosmology and tritium-beta de-
cay experiments. Future large scale structure sur-
veys like the recently approved EUCLID [13], will

allow to constrain(cid:80)

combined with Planck data.
In the following we explore the conditions under
which multi-messenger astronomy can reveal or
constrain the neutrino mass ordering and abso-
lute mass.

II. MULTI-MESSENGER ASTRONOMY

The detection of GWs is a crucial test of
general relativity and, as already discussed in
the literature (see e.g. [14]), it is also important
to deduce other relevant physical properties.
This new information can be derived when
comparing,
their propagation
velocity with those of photons and neutrinos
coming both from the same astrophysical source.

Let’s start by considering a potential obser-
vation of an astrophysical catastrophe. Using
the same notation of [14], we denote with Tg ≡
≡ L/vνi and Tγ ≡ L/vγ respectively the
L/vg, Tνi
time of propagation of a GW, a given neutrino
mass eigenstate and photons with group veloci-
ties vg, vνi, and vγ. Following Fig. 1 a GW is emit-
ted at the time tE
g from a source at distance L and
detected on Earth at tg. Similarly, we have emis-
sion and detection times for photons and neu-
trinos. For instance, astrophysical catastrophes
like the merging of a neutron star binary or the
core bounce of a core-collapsed supernova (SN)

where we assumed that the diﬀerent species of
neutrinos have been produced with a common
energy value E. If a given neutrino is produced
by a source at a distance L, the time-of-ﬂight delay
∆ti with respect to a massless particle, emitted by
the same source at the same time, is

From the expression in (2) we observe that larger
distances and small neutrino energies are needed
in order to maximise the experimental sensitivity.

For distances around 50 kpc (SN1987A) and an
energy of 10 MeV, a neutrino with a mass of 0.07
eV (the upper current absolute mass scale inferred
from the Planck Collaboration [8]) would arrive
∼ 10

viewed the current status of neutrino ordering in

C. Disentangling neutrino mass ordering

We are now equipped with the needed in-
formation to address our overarching quests.
From (3) we observe that if the detector uncer-
tainty is ∼ 10
−3 s we are able to disentangle
the atmospheric (solar) squared mass diﬀerences
with a signal coming from a distance larger than
0.8 (26) Mpc assuming neutrinos have an energy
of about 10 MeV. These distances decrease if we
lower the neutrino energy.
In fact, for neutrinos with an average energy of
10 MeV, the delay time of the heaviest neutrino
mass eigenstate with respect to the lighter ones is
−3 s independently of the absolute
larger than 10
neutrino mass scale and hierarchy, for distances

as function of the lightest neutrino mass, setting
the neutrino energy to 10 MeV and the distance
of the source to 1 Mpc. The physically relevant
arrival time diﬀerences between neutrino mass
eigenstates ∆tνiνj can be readily determined from
Fig. 2. We also report in the plot the future sensi-
tivity on the absolute neutrino mass of the β-decay
experiment KATRIN [17] which is expected to be
around 0.2 eV and the constraints given by the
Planck Collaboration on the sum of the light active

we observe that for the given distance and energy,
the NO and IO spectra diﬀer by having diﬀerent
time delays i.e. diﬀerent detection patterns. We
note that for IO the delay between the two heavi-
est mass eigenstates is equivalent to the time lapse
between the ﬁrst two lighter mass eigenstates for
NO. The time lapse diﬀerences for both NO and
IO will fall within reach of the next generation of
detectors in which the time accuracy is expected to

for the distances of 1 (10) Mpc but with a neutrino
mass energy of 5 MeV which is still within exper-
imental reach [18].

In addition to the time stamp information, also
the ratio between the amplitudes of the diﬀer-
ent neutrinos reaching the detector can be mea-
sured. Since the distances considered here are
very large, neutrinos will reach the detector in-
coherently such that the time integrated arrival

perimental resolution, the following consistency
condition to hold:

expression holds true whenever the time arrival
diﬀerences among the three mass eigenstates is
smaller than the detector time resolution. How-
ever, when ∆tνiνj is larger than the detector resolu-
tion, then each mass eigenstates νi can be detected
independently and will interact with the detector

In Fig. 3 we illustrate a possible pattern of neu-
trino detection following (5) using also the time-
diﬀerences reported in Table III. Depending on
the source, its distance and the experimental time
sensitivity the ﬁgure shows that, at least in prin-
ciple, one can observe interesting time-patterns
reﬂecting the neutrino ordering and mixing.
So far we discussed the basic setup and argued
that neutrino detectors on Earth can help disen-
tangle the neutrino ordering, when observing dis-
tant astrophysical catastrophes. It is time to move

region). In the right panel of Fig. 4 we show the
inequality (15) reach in the case neutrinos were
detected for the GW150914 event [1] correspond-
ing to a distance of 400 Mpc.
Depending on the distance and the considered
neutrino energy, we obtain diﬀerent sensitivity
on mmin which are at least an order of magnitude
lower than present cosmological limits and the
perspective upper limit from KATRIN. For exam-
ple, for 10 Mpc it is possible to probe the lightest
neutrino mass up to ∼ 0.02 eV, while events such
as GW150914, could probe masses of an order of
magnitude less.
Last, we notice that limits on vg can also be ob-
tained from high energetic events or from the re-
quirement of Lorentz invariance.
In fact, if the
GW velocity is subluminal, then cosmic rays lose
their energy via gravitational Cherenkov radia-
tion and cannot reach the Earth. The fact that
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are observed on
Earth limits the GW propagation speed to be

tion made by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Mon-

III. GW150914-LIKE SOURCES AND

CONCLUSIONS

In the light of the recent LIGO and Fermi
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) observations
[1, 20] of the event GW150914 at around 400 Mpc
seemingly accompanied by a weak transient
source around 50 kEV, 0.4 s after the GW event,
we consider the implications of a potential
observation of a neutrino counterpart of such
events. Even if this might not occur for this event,
our analysis can be used for future detections.
In the left panel of Fig. 5 we plot the time
lapses for NO of the three mass eigenstates for
GW150914 considering L = 400 Mpc, and a neu-
trino energy Eν = 5 MeV. The time lag between
the second and the third mass eigenstates for NO
is as big as 2.02 s. For comparison in the right
panel we plot the time lags for NO at a smaller
distance i.e. 10 Mpc. From Table III we see that at
this distance we already have substantially large
time lapses of the order of 5.06· 10
−2 s. For the IO

case the time diﬀerence between the two heavy
mass eigenstates reduces to few milliseconds.
Therefore the neutrino orders and associated hi-
erarchy lead to fundamentally diﬀerent imprints
if detected together with GW150914 or future
similar sources.
Our approach is complementary to the one
proposed in [18] where a careful analysis of
signals emitted by a SN explosion within our
galaxy (typically 2-3 events per century) can
provide information on the neutrino ordering.
There is also the hope to collect circa one neutrino
per event from SNs within 10 Mpc [22]. This
would slowly build up statistics that might be
used, when combined with the multi-messenger
framework, to deduce relevant information on
the neutrino ordering. Moreover, from the details
of the GW signal one can learn about the source
allowing to reﬁne our framework in order to rip
maximal information from diﬀerent astrophysical
catastrophes.
To conclude, we derived the theoretical and
phenomenological
conditions under which
multi-messenger astronomy can disentangle or
further constrain the neutrino mass ordering.
We have also argued that it can provide salient
information on the absolute neutrino masses. We
have shown that the multi-messenger astronomy
in resolving the mass
can increase the reach,
hierarchy and absolute mass of
the lightest

than the current limits given by cosmological and
particle-physics experiments. Conversely one
can use future results on neutrino properties to
provide detailed information about astrophysical
sources emitting simultaneously GWs, photons
and neutrinos.
