Quantum phase slips are the primary excitations in one-dimensional superﬂuids and superconductors
at low temperatures but their existence in ultracold quantum gases has not been demonstrated yet.
We now study experimentally the nucleation rate of phase slips in one-dimensional superﬂuids realized
with ultracold quantum gases, ﬂowing along a periodic potential. We observe a crossover between a
regime of temperature-dependent dissipation at small velocity and interaction and a second regime of
velocity-dependent dissipation at larger velocity and interaction. This behavior is consistent with the
predicted crossover from thermally-assisted quantum phase slips to purely quantum phase slips.

Phase slips, i.e. phase ﬂuctuations of the superﬂuid order parameter, are the dominant excitations of one-dimensional
(1D) superﬂuids and superconductors in the presence of an obstacle for the superﬂow. Remarkably, phase slips may
occur even at zero temperature, due to quantum tunneling events [1]. This mechanism, known as quantum phase slips
(QPS), controls the dissipation of nominally frictionless systems and has been observed in quasi-1D superconducting
nanowires [2–7] and in Josephson junctions chains [8]. There is currently a large interest in QPS as the fundamental
process for the realization of topologically protected qubits [9, 10] or for the implementation of a quantum standard
for the electrical current [8, 11]. QPS have not yet been clearly identiﬁed in superﬂuids based on ultracold quantum
gases. Although several studies have shown the presence of strong dissipation for superﬂuids moving in optical
lattices [12–15], the closest indication of QPS is just the onset of a regime of temperature-independent dissipation at
low temperature [14]. In this work we study for the ﬁrst time how the dissipation depends on the superﬂuid velocity,
in addition to other key parameters such as temperature and strength of the interparticle interaction. We observe a
clear crossover between a temperature-dependent regime and a velocity dependent regime, in general agreement with
theoretical predictions for the crossover from thermal to quantum phase slips [16–19]. This indicates that QPS can
be observed and controlled also in ultracold quantum gases.

Let us start by introducing the mechanisms for the generation of phase slips. A 1D superﬂuid can be described by
a complex order parameter Ψ(x) = |Ψ(x)|eiφ(x). The superﬂuid metastable state corresponds to a local minimum of
the Ginzburg-Landau free energy potential F [20]. A phase slip event is a local ﬂuctuation in Ψ(x) corresponding
to the suppression of its modulus and a simultaneous phase jump of 2π. When a phase slip occurs, the state with
superﬂuid velocity v ∝ ∇φ(x) decays into a state with lower velocity, since the phase has locally unwound [21]. As

2

shown in Fig. 1, three diﬀerent processes may activate a phase slip, depending on the temperature regime. When
the temperature is much higher than the free-energy barrier between two metastable states, T ≫ δF/kB, the order
parameter may overcome the barrier via thermal ﬂuctuations, causing the formation of thermally activated phase
slips (TAPS) with a nucleation rate following the Arrhenius law Γ ∝ e−δF/kB T [22, 23]. When T <
∼ δF/kB, the
probability of TAPS becomes small, and phase slips occur mainly via quantum tunnelling through the free-energy
barrier. Following quantum mechanical arguments one can ﬁnd a characteristic temperature T ∗ below which the QPS
nucleation rate is temperature-independent [1, 24], while in an intermediate temperature range, T ∗ <
∼ δF/kB,
QPS are thermally assisted (TAQPS) [25].
The analytical form of δF and T ∗ depends on the speciﬁc type of obstacle experienced by the superﬂow, e.g.
disorder, isolated defects or periodic potentials [16, 18, 26]. For a superﬂuid moving along a periodic potential the
relevant energy scale is the Josephson plasma energy Ej [18, 19], which sets the free-energy barrier δF ≃ Ej and
determines also the crossover temperature, T ∗ ≃ Ej/kB × v/vc, between the QPS and TAQPS regimes. Here v and
vc are the superﬂuid velocity and the critical velocity for the dynamical instability [27–29], respectively. Theoretical
studies in the Bose-Hubbard limit show that the phase-slip nucleation rate should have a characteristic dependence
on velocity, temperature and interaction strength that is quite diﬀerent for TAQPS and QPS: Γ ∼ vT 2K−3 for the
TAQPS regime and Γ ∼ v2K−2 for the QPS regime, where the Luttinger parameter K is related to the interaction
strength [18, 19, 30]. These results apply for small velocities, far from the critical velocity vc, where instead TAPS
tend to dominate [17].

∼ T <

Experiments with ultracold gases in optical lattices have revealed a strong dissipation that may be associated to
phase slip proliferation [12–15]. Most of the experiments have been performed for large velocity or large interaction,
close to the dynamical instability [13, 15] or to the superﬂuid-insulator transition [12, 13, 15]. Characterizing the
phase slips is challenging in such limit, since the nucleation rates tend to diverge [17]. At lower velocities, a weaker
dissipation that depends on the interaction has been observed [14, 15], as well as the onset of a regime of temperature-
independent dissipation [14]. The latter in particular is a strong indication of the onset of QPS, although it has not
been possible to ﬁnd a quantitative agreement with the theory. So far, it has not been possible to study the velocity
dependence of the dissipation rate predicted for the TAQPS and QPS regimes.

In this work we demonstrate that it is possible to measure also the velocity dependence, by employing 1D superﬂuids
with tunable interaction and weak periodic potentials. The idea is that a weak lattice in the Sine-Gordon limit shifts
the critical velocity towards the band edge, thus enlarging the range of accessible v. The tunable interaction adds
instead an independent way of controlling the Josephson energy. By tuning both velocity and interaction we indeed
observe a clear change of behavior of the phase-slip nucleation rate that resembles that of the theory and suggests a
crossover between the TAQPS and QPS regimes.

Experimental observables
In the experiment we employ an array of 1D superﬂuids in an optical lattice. In order to study the dissipation rate,
we excite oscillations of the superﬂuids by suddenly displacing the center of an harmonic trap that conﬁnes the atoms,
as shown in Fig. 2a. By changing the displacement ∆z we can excite oscillations with diﬀerent amplitudes. After a

variable oscillation time, we suddenly switch oﬀ all the conﬁning potentials and we let the atoms free to expand to
record the momentum distribution ρ(p) (Fig. 2b). Since the expansion mixes all subsystems, our measurements give
information on their mean properties. By ﬁtting ρ(p) with a Lorentzian function, we measure the quasi-momentum
p and the half-width at half maximum, δp. Since the lattice dispersion is linear in the whole velocity range we have
studied, we can safely identify p with the center-of-mass momentum. From the momentum width at t=0, δp0, we

can estimate the temperature [31, 32], which in our measurements ranges from 20 to 40 nK. The measurements are
performed for a wide range of interaction strength; in terms of the Lieb-Liniger parameter γ, this ranges from 0.13
to 1.22. The Josephson plasma energy Ej depends on the interaction strength via the sound velocity [see Methods].
Moving from weak to strong interactions, Ej/kb varies from 20 to 35 nK. Fig. 3 shows a typical observation for

respectively corresponding to trap displacements ∆z=1.5 µm and ∆z=4 µm. The lines in panel (a) are ﬁts to measure the

the time evolution of p and δp at a given interaction (γ = 1.22) and at two diﬀerent trap displacements, which
correspond to two diﬀerent velocities. In accordance to the theory, we label each dataset with the maximum velocity
v reached during the ﬁrst oscillation [19]. We ﬁt the evolution of p using an oscillator model with a friction term:
p(t) = m∗˜v exp(−Gt) sin(ω′t + ϕ), where ω′ = pω2
z m/m∗ − G2, m∗ is the eﬀective mass in the lattice, ωz is the
frequency of the harmonic potential, ˜v and ϕ are ﬁtting parameters [see Methods]. The growth of δp is ﬁtted with an
inverted exponential with time constant τ . We observe that the damping rate G is directly related to τ , via 2τ ≃ 1/G
(within 0.6 standard deviations), as the mechanical energy dissipated in the oscillation is converted into momentum
spread.

Results
By measuring the time evolution of p we have direct access to G, the damping rate of the oscillation. The theory
predicts a direct relation between the measured damping rate G and the phase slip nucleation rate Γ, i.e. G ∝ Γ/v
[19, 33]. Therefore, in the QPS regime the damping rate G depends on v but not on T , G ∼ v2K−3. Conversely, in
the TAQPS regime G depends on T but not on v, G ∼ T 2K−3.
As shown in the example in Fig. 3 for γ = 1.22, a small velocity v typically leads to a very weakly damped
oscillation. A larger v with the same interaction strength leads instead to a larger damping, suggesting the presence
of phase slips with a nucleation rate that depends on the velocity. We have repeated this type of measurement for a
wide range of velocities and interaction strengths. A summary of the evolution of G with velocity and interaction for
approximately constant temperature is shown in Fig. 4. Each data set corresponds to a diﬀerent γ and is rescaled to
the corresponding critical velocity vc for the occurrence of the dynamical instability. At weak interaction (black), G
is essentially independent of v. At stronger interactions (orange, blue), we observe instead a clear crossover from a
regime of constant G to a regime where G grows with the velocity. A ﬁt of the data with a piece-wise linear function is
used to determine the crossover velocity v∗, that is the minimum velocity required to enter the regime of dependence
on v. The crossover velocity apparently decreases for increasing interaction.

A similar behavior is observed also at diﬀerent temperatures. For example in Fig. 5 we compare two datasets with
approximately constant γ but diﬀerent T . In the v-independent regime the damping rate G is strongly aﬀected by
temperature, with a monotonic increase of G with T (inset in Fig. 5), while the dependence on interaction (Fig. 4)

is weaker. Instead, in the v-dependent regime interaction eﬀects are apparently dominant (Fig. 4) and we cannot
measure a clear dependence on T (Fig. 5). The combination of these eﬀects leads to an increase of the crossover
velocity for increasing temperature.

Discussion

These observations suggest that our system is at the crossover between the TAQPS and QPS regimes. As we will
show, the crossover is not controlled by changing the temperature T , but rather by varying the crossover temperature
T ∗ ∝ Ej/kB × v/vc through a change in velocity and interaction strength [18]. For T ∗ < T , i.e. at small velocity and
small interaction, the system is apparently in the TAQPS regime, since G does not show any substantial dependence
on v, but only on T . For T ∗ > T , i.e. at large velocity and large interaction, the system enters a regime where G is
temperature independent and is approximately linearly dependent on the velocity. This suggests that the system is in a
regime of QPS. A further indication of the observation of the TAQPS-QPS crossover comes from the dependence of v∗
on temperature and interaction strength. In Fig. 6 we report the measured crossover velocity normalized to the critical
velocity, v∗/vc, versus the temperature normalized to the Josephson energy, kBT /Ej. The data show a clear linear
scaling, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction kBT ∗/Ej ∝ v/vc. From a ﬁt we get kBT ∗=4.9(14)Ejv/vc
- 0.4(4)Ej.
The v-dependent regime shows also the characteristics features already observed in previous experiments: a weak
T dependence [14] and a strong interaction dependence [14, 15].This suggest that the QPS regime has already been
reached in previous experiments on ultracold quantum gases.

We note that it is not possible to reach a quantitative agreement with the theory for G(v) in the regime we attribute
to QPS. On the theory side, the power-law behavior we showed above is valid only for very low velocities (p < hk/10),
while in the experimental range (hk/10 < p < hk/2) a diﬀerent, exponential behavior has been predicted [18, 19].
Furthermore, the theory is done in the Bose-Hubbard limit, and it is not clear if it can be immediately extended to
the Sine-Gordon limit. On the experimental side, the limited range of accessible velocities, which is limited by the
ﬁnite T on the low-v side, does not allow us to distinguish a power law from an exponential. If we ﬁt our data with
a power law, we get exponents of the order unity, which are essentially interaction independent [34]. Further work in
theory and experiment is clearly needed to try reaching a quantitative agreement.

We ﬁnally note that our measurements are incompatible with dissipation of the Landau type [28, 29, 35, 36],
which may appear for velocities larger than the sound velocity vs. Indeed, not only we typically have v < vs, but
additionally vs increases with the interaction strength, so that one should observe a decrease of G with increasing γ
at a ﬁxed velocity, and not the increase shown for example in Fig. 4.

Conclusion In conclusion, our measurements reveal a crossover behavior of the dissipation in atomic superﬂuids
that reproduces closely the crossover between TAQPS and QPS predicted by the theory. One important feature of
our setup is that the QPS regime can be reached at constant temperature, by tuning the velocity or the interaction.
This oﬀers the possibility to control the QPS nucleation rate and opens new perspectives for the study of QPS-related
phenomena in ultracold quantum gases. In the future it might be possible to directly observe individual QPS events
by interferometric means [37, 38] or by single atom detection [39, 40], allowing to study in depth the nucleation

6

mechanisms of quantum and thermal phase slips. Furthermore, methods analogous to those reported in this work
could be used to study fundamental aspects of the QPS nucleation by individual defects or controlled disorder [16, 26].

To tune the interparticle interaction we vary the 1D scattering length a1D = a2

Methods
In the experiment we employ 39K atoms, for which we can accurately tune the interaction thanks to a broad Feshbach
resonance [41]. The 1D superﬂuids are realized by splitting a 3D Bose-Einstein condensate into about 1000 subsystems,
using a deep 2D lattice in the horizontal plane [15]. Each subsystem contains on average 30 atoms. The transverse
trapping energy ¯hω⊥=h×40 kHz is much larger than all other energy scales, realizing eﬀectively one-dimensional
systems. The weak optical lattice with depth V =1.0(1)ER is then added along the longitudinal direction z. The
lattice spacing is d=532 nm and ER = ¯h2k2/2m is the recoil energy, with k = π/d the lattice wavevector. Along z is
also present an harmonic potential with frequency ωz=2π×150 Hz.
⊥(1 − 1.03a/a⊥)/2a, where a⊥ =
p¯h/mω⊥ is ﬁxed by the 2D lattice whereas the 3D scattering length a can be adjusted at a Feshbach resonance [41] by
using a magnetic ﬁeld. By varing the 1D scattering length, we tune both the Josephson energy EJ and the Lieb-Liniger
parameter γ. The Josephson energy is deﬁned as Ej = ¯hvs/√2d, where vs = ¯hpρd2/a1D/m∗ is the sound velocity,
m∗ = 1.05 m is the eﬀective mass in the lattice and ρ is the density. The Lieb-Liniger is deﬁned as γ = 1/(ρ0a1D),
with ρ0 being the tube peak density. In the limit of no lattice potential (V = 0) and for small interactions (γ ≤ 10)
γ can be related to the Luttinger parameter as K ≈ π/pγ − γ3/2/(2π) [42]. In our inhomogeneous system both EJ
and γ are calculated averaging over all tubes [43], resulting in EJ ≈ 0.3 γ1/4. Also the mean ﬁlling n changes with the
interaction and it is found to scale as n ≈ γ−1/4. In our range of γ, when moving from weak to strong interactions,
n changes from about 2 to 1.
In the range of parameters we have studied, our system is always in the underdamped regime, G < ωz, indicating
that phase slips are generated on timescales longer than the oscillation period. In this regime it is meaningful to
study the dependence of G on the maximum velocity v reached during the ﬁrst oscillation. v corresponds to a trap
displacement ∆z that can be suitably changed by varying a magnetic ﬁeld gradient which partially compansates for
gravity.

The critical velocity vc is measured according to the technique introduced in Ref. [15]. As the interaction is

increased, we ﬁnd that vc decreases as expected, varying from 7.1(3) to 5.4(6) mm/s [44].

From the momentum width at t=0 and the mean atom number per site, we are able to estimate the temperature
T via kBT = ¯hnδp0/0.64m∗d [31, 32], where the eﬀective mass takes into account the presence of the shallow lattice.
Since in our measurements T is below the 1D degeneracy temperature Tc ≃ 50 nK, the system is in the quasicondensate
regime [45].
All the error bars and uncertainties reported in the manuscript are statistical errors. A 30% systematic uncertainty
on the calibration of the atom number leads to additional systematic errors of 12% on γ, 6% on Ej, 12% on T and
6% on T /Ej.

[33] Another derivation of the relation between Γ and G is the following: The deceleration at the ﬁrst maximum in the
oscillations is dv/dt=−Gv. In terms of individual phase slips this can be written as δv/δt, where δv=−h/mL is the
deceleration following a phase slip of 2π in a chain of length L and δt−1=Γ.

[34] By ﬁtting the data with power-low functions we measure exponents of G ranging between 0.8 and 2, for the various

interaction strengths explored in the experiment.
