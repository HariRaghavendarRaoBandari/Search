Abstract

We investigate the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions up to an ex-
plosion time for regime-switching diﬀusion processes in an inﬁnite state space.
Instead of concrete conditions on coeﬃcients, our existence and uniqueness result
is established under the general assumption that the diﬀusion in every ﬁxed en-
vironment has a unique non-explosive strong solution. Moreover, non-explosion
conditions for regime-switching diﬀusion processes are given. The strong Feller
property is proved by further assuming that the diﬀusion in every ﬁxed environ-
ment generates a strong Feller semigroup.

Introduction

Many uncertain hybrid systems from ﬁnancial engineering, wireless communications,
biology and etc. can be modeled by the regime-switching diﬀusion processes(RSDPs
for short), see [20] and references.
In these models, the continuous dynamics and
discrete events coexist. Various properties of these processes have been concerned
recently. For example, [5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 19] had studied the recurrent properties,
[2, 4, 12, 16, 20] concerned stability and optimal control, and [13] investigated the
asymptotic properties. We mention monographs [4] and [20] for system surveys on
the research of regime-switching processes.

Let S be the set of all the natural numbers, i.e. S = {1, 2, 3, · · · , n, · · · }, (Ω, F , P)
be a completed probability space. A regime-switching diﬀusion process is a two
components process {(Xt, Λt)}t≥0 described by

dXt = b(Xt, Λt, t)dt + σ(Xt, Λt, t)dWt,

and

P (Λt+∆t = j | Λt = i, (Xs, Λs), s ≤ t) =(cid:26) qij(Xt)∆t + o(∆t),

1 + qii(Xt)∆t + o(∆t),

i 6= j,
i = j,

where {Wt}t≥0 is a Brownian motion on Rd w.r.t a completed reference {Ft}t≥0 and

b : Rd × S × [0, ∞) → Rd, σ : Rd × S × [0, ∞) → Rd ⊗ Rd, qij : Rd → R,

are measurable functions and

qij(x) ≥ 0, i 6= j, Xj6=i

qij(x) ≤ −qii(x).

The matrix Q(x) = (qij(x)) is called Q-matrix, see [1]. If Q(x) is independent of x
and Λt is independent of {Wt}t≥0, {(Xt, Λt)}t≥0 is called a state-independent RSDP,
otherwise called a state-dependence RSDP. Let

qi(x) =Xj6=i

qij(x), i ∈ S.

If Q(x) is conservative, i.e. −qii(x) = qi(x), x ∈ Rd, then as in [13, Chapter II-2.1]
or [2, 19, 10], we can represent {(Xt, Λt)}t≥0 in the form of a system of stochastic
diﬀerential equations(SDEs for short) driven by {Wt} and a Poisson random measure.
Precisely, for each x ∈ Rd, {Γij(x) : i, j ∈ S} is a family of disjoint intervals on [0, ∞)
constructed as follows

Γ12(x) = [0, q12(x)), Γ13(x) = [q12(x), q12(x) + q13(x)), · · ·
Γ21(x) = [q1(x), q1(x) + q21(x)), Γ23(x) = [q1(x) + q21(x), q1(x) + q21(x) + q23(x)), · · ·
Γ31(x) = [q1(x) + q2(x), q1(x) + q2(x) + q13(x)), · · ·

· · ·

We set Γii(x) = ∅ and Γij(x) = ∅ if qij(x) = 0 for i 6= j. Deﬁne a function h :
Rd × S × [0, ∞) → R as follows

h(x, i, z) =Xj∈S

(j − i)1Γij (x)(z) =(cid:26) j − i,

0,

if z ∈ Γij(x),
otherwise.

Let N (dz, dt) be a Poisson random measure with intensity dtdz and independent of
the Brownian motion {Wt}t≥0. Then we turn to concern the following equation

(dXt = b(Xt, Λt, t)dt + σ(Xt, Λt, t)dWt,
dΛt =R ∞

0 h(Xt−, Λt−, z)N (dz, dt).

(1.3)

Denote the diﬀusion process in the ﬁxed environment i ∈ S by xi
t, see (2.1) for more
precise deﬁnition. Showing as in (1.3) or (1.1) and (1.2), one can image that the
diﬀusion component {Xt}t≥0 is a hybrid process of {xi
t}i∈S via jump process Λt. A
quite nature question is that if all the diﬀusion processes {{xi
t}t≥0}i∈S process some
comment property(such as pathwise uniqueness, strong Feller property, recurrence,
ergodicity and etc.), then what about {(Xt, Λt)}t≥0? In fact, many works, such as
[9, 10, 12, 19], give us some insight on this problem.

There are some papers focusing on existence and uniqueness of strong solutions
and strong Feller property for RSDPs. For instance, we refer to [14] for existence and
uniqueness of solution in a ﬁnite state space, to [10, 15, 19] for strong Feller property.

Regime-switching: strong solutions and strong Feller

It should be pointed out that, [10] established the existence and uniqueness and
strong Feller property to the strong solution of state-dependent RSDPs in an inﬁnite
state space with some type of non-Lipschitz coeﬃcients. However, existence and
uniqueness theorem in [10] can not be applied to more irregular case, such as H¨older
continuous coeﬃcients or Sobolev coeﬃcients, which have been intensively studied
recently. Here, we only mention [17] for a brief survey in their introduction on strong
uniqueness of SDEs with singular coeﬃcients and references therein. Hence one aim of
the this paper is to investigate the existence and uniqueness of the regime-switching
processes that the coeﬃcients may be singular. Another aim is to concern strong
Feller property of {(Xt, Λt)}t≥0 under the assumption that the diﬀusion in every
ﬁxed environment processes the same property. The method used here is diﬀerent
from [10]. Our argument is based on the following simple observation(formally), that
is if {qi}i∈S are locally bounded and sups∈[0,t] (|Xs−| + Λs−) ≤ M (M ∈ S), then

supp (h(Xs−, Λs−, ·)) ⊂

on any ﬁnite interval. This allows us to generalize the method used in [14](see also
[3, Theorem IV.9.1]), and give an interlacing construction to the solution of (1.3)
before (Xt, Λt) escapes a bounded domain. The strong Feller property is also studied
following this idea which is also diﬀerent from [10, 19], where they got the strong
Feller property by a ﬁnite-state approximation argument. Since we do not assume
the concrete conditions on coeﬃcients of the diﬀusion part, our results can be applied
to the case that the diﬀusion component may be irregular and degenerated.

study the strong Feller property.

Throughout this paper, we assume that the Q-matrix Q(x) is conservative, that is

−qii(x) = qi(x)

=Xj6=i

qij(x)
 ,

for more details on continuous time Markov chains, one can consult [1] . By this
assumption, then we shall prove the existence of a unique strong solution to the
equation (1.3).

We introduce the following hypothesis

Hypothesis (H) For each i ∈ S, t0 ≥ 0, the following equation

dxt = b(xt, i, t + t0)dt + σ(xt, i, t + t0)dWt

(2.1)

has a unique non-explosive strong solution.

Let

W d = C([0, ∞), Rd), W d

σ-ﬁeld of W d and Bt(W d) be the sub-σ-ﬁeld of B(W d) generated by ω(s), 0 ≤

process xi,t0 := {xi,t0
t }t≥0 deﬁned on a probability space with a reference family
and a Brownian motion {Wt}t≥0 is a strong solution of (2.1), if there is a function

In general, the solution to (1.3) can be explosive. So we consider the local solution.

Deﬁnition 2.1. An adapted process {(Xt, Λt)}t∈[0,τ ) with the ﬁrst component is con-
tinuous and the second one is cadlag is called a local solution of (1.3) with life time
τ , if τ > 0 is a stopping time such that P-a.s. lim supt↑τ (|Xt| + Λt) = ∞ holds on
{τ < ∞} and P-a.s.

0 R ∞
Λt = Λ0 +R t

0 σ(Xs, Λs, s)dWs,
0 h(Xs, Λs−, z)N (dz, ds), t ∈ [0, τ ).

Our ﬁrst result is the following

Theorem 2.1. Assume that (H) holds, and for each k ∈ S, qk is locally bounded.
Then for each initial value (x, i) ∈ Rd × S, the equation (1.3) has a unique local strong
solution {(Xt, Λt)}t∈[0,τ ) with life time τ .

We can extend Theorem 2.1 to some cases that the diﬀusion in each environment

may be explosive.

Corollary 2.2. For all M > 0, let

bM (x, i, t) = b(x, i, t)1{|x|≤M,t≤M }(x), σM (x, i, t) = σ(x, i, t)1{|x|≤M,t≤M }(x).

If for all M > 0, i ∈ S, the equation

t = bM (xM

, i, t)dt + σM (xM

, i, t)dWt

has a unique non-explosive strong solution, and qi(·) is locally bounded, then the
equation (1.3) has a unique local strong solution {(Xt, Λt)}t∈[0,τ ) with lift time τ .

Before the proof of our results, we present a lemma on a SDE(see (2.2)) with ran-

be a Brownian motion on this probability space w.r.t. some completed ref-

dom coeﬃcients related to (2.1). Let(cid:16)˜P, ˜Ω, ˜F(cid:17) be some completed probability space,
n ˜Wtot≥0
erence n ˜Ftot≥0

. Let (η, ζ, ξ) : ˜Ω → S × (0, ∞) × Rd be a random vector which is
independent of { ˜Wt}t≥0 and (η, ζ, ξ) ∈ ˜F0. Denote the distribution of (η, ζ, ξ) by µ.
Let

Gt be the completion of ˚Gt by ˜P. Consider the following SDEs with random coeﬃcients

˚Gt = σ(cid:16)nη, ζ, ξ, ˜Ws | s ≤ to(cid:17) ,

dxt = b(xt, η, t + ζ)dt + σ(xt, η, t + ζ)d ˜Wt, x0 = ξ.

(2.2)

We say a continuous adapted process {xt}t≥0 is a solution to (2.2) with a Brownian
motion { ˜Wt}t≥0, if

|b(xs, η, s + ζ)| + |σ(xs, η, s + ζ)|2 ds < ∞, t ≥ 0, ˜P-a.s.

0 → W d such
Due to the hypothesis (H), there exists F : S × (0, ∞) × Rd × W d
that {F (i, t0, x, ˜W·)t}t≥0 is the solution of (2.1) starting from x. Since (η, ζ, ξ) is
independent of { ˜W }t≥0 and (ξ, η, ζ) ∈ ˜F0, {F (ξ, η, ζ, ˜W·)t}t≥0 is a solution of (2.2).

Lemma 2.3. Assume that (H) holds. Let {x′
t = F (η, ζ, ξ, ˜W·)t, t ≥ 0, ˜P-a.s.
x′

Proof. It is clear that x′

µ(η, ζ, ξ, ˜W·)t ∈ ˜Ft,
F ′

and ˜P(cid:16)x′ = F ′

µ(η, ζ, ξ, ˜W·)(cid:17) = 1.

Due to [7, Lemma V.10.1], there is Φ : S × (0, ∞) × Rd × W d

0 → W d such that

σ(F ′

µ(η, ζ, ξ, ˜W·)s, η, s + ζ)d ˜Ws = Φ(η, ζ, ξ, ˜W·)t, t ≥ 0.

Then we have ˜P-a.s.

b(F ′

µ(η, ζ, ξ, ˜W·)s, η, s + ζ)ds, t ≥ 0.

Hence, for µ-a.s. (i, t0, x) ∈ S × (0, ∞) × Rd, ˜P-a.s.

F ′

µ(i, t0, x, ˜W·)t = x + Φ(i, t0, x, ˜W·)t +Z t

b(F ′

µ(i, t0, x, ˜W·)s, i, s + t0)ds, t ≥ 0.

That means F ′

µ(i, t0, x, ˜W·)t is a solution of (2.1) with W replaced by ˜W . If

˜P(cid:16)x′ 6= F (η, ζ, ξ, ˜W·)(cid:17) > 0,

˜P(cid:16)F (η, ζ, ξ, ˜W·) 6= F ′

µ(η, ζ, ξ, ˜W·)(cid:17) > 0.

Since (η, ζ, ξ) is independent of { ˜Wt}t≥0, there is A ⊂ S × (0, ∞) × Rd with µ(A) > 0
such that

˜P(cid:16)F (i, t0, x, ˜W·) 6= F ′

µ(i, t0, x, ˜W·)(cid:17) > 0,

(i, t0, x) ∈ A.

It contradicts (H), since {F (i, t0, x, ˜W·)t}t≥0 and {F ′

µ(i, t0, x, ˜W·)t}t≥0 are two solu-

tions of (2.1) on the probability space (cid:16) ˜Ω, ˜F , ˜P(cid:17) with the same Brownian motion

˜W .

Lastly, we prove the pathwise uniqueness of solutions to (1.3). Let (Xt, Λt) and
( ˜Xt, ˜Λt) be two solutions in the same probability space with the same Brownian
motion and Poisson random measure. For each M ∈ S with M > |x| + i, let

|Xt| + |Λt| ≥ Mo , ˜τM = infnt ≥ 0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

That means (Xt, Λt) is a solution of (2.3) before τM . So does for (cid:16) ˜Xt, ˜Λt(cid:17). Then by

uniqueness of (2.3), we obtain that

(Xt∧τM , Λt∧τM ) =(cid:16) ˜Xt∧˜τM , ˜Λt∧˜τM(cid:17) .

Therefore we get the pathwise uniqueness of solutions to (1.3).

Therefore, the proof is completed.

Remark 2.1. The conditions in (1) and (2) are an extension of that used in [17,
Lemma 3.1], and they can be applied to the situation treated in [10, Theorem 2.3]. In
fact, in that case, we can let β = 1, p = 1. Comparing with [10, Theorem 2.3], our
conditions allow that {qi(·)}i∈S are not necessary uniformly bounded on Rd. However,
it is a pity that qi(x) is at most linear growth for the variable i.

We present the following example to illustrate our conditions on Q-matrix Q(x).

3 Strong Feller Property

In this section, we shall investigate the strong Feller property for (Xt, Λt) following
the idea used in Theorem 2.1. Let f be a bounded measurable function on Rd × S,
Ptf (x, i) = Ef (X x,i
Denote the transition semigroup associated with (2.1) by P i

Theorem 3.1. Assume that (H) holds, moreover for each i ∈ S, qi is locally bounded
and the semigroup {P i

Rd × S, M ∈ S, M > |x| + i,

Assume that for each x ∈ Rd, there exits δ > 0 such that

Remark 3.1. This theorem partly generalizes [10, Theorem 3.2], and works well
when the diﬀusion in each environment is degenerated.

Combining the results in the previous section, it is easy to get that

Corollary 3.3. Fix T > 0. Under the assumptions of Theorem 2.1 and Theorem
2.4, if for each i ∈ S, the semigroup {P i
t }t∈(0,T ] generated by (2.1)(t0 = 0) is strong
Feller holds, then Pt has strong Feller property for t > 0.

Proof. We only have to prove (3.1). Let τ x,i
M as in Theorem 3.1. According to the proof
of Theorem 2.4, there exists a locally bounded function f : [0, T ] × Rd × S → [1, ∞)
