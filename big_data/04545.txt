The lifting of dxz-dyz orbital degeneracy is often considered a hallmark of the nematic state of Fe-based
superconductors, including FeSe. However the momentum-dependence of this orbital ordering is not yet un-
derstood, which has implications for the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity. Here we report a
high resolution Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy study of single crystals of FeSe, accounting for
the photon-energy dependence and using new data analysis methods. We ﬁnd that the hole pocket undergoes a
fourfold-symmetry-breaking distortion in the nematic phase, but in contrast the changes to the electron pock-
ets do not require fourfold symmetry-breaking. Instead, there is an additional separation of the existing dxy
and dxz/yz bands - which themselves are not split within resolution. These observations constrain the possible
momentum-dependence of the orbital ordering, which leads us to propose a new scenario, supported by a good
agreement with 5-orbital tight binding calculations, in which the nematic state of FeSe is characterised by a
striped antiferro-orbital ordering.

The search for the understanding of unconventional super-
conductivity in the Fe-based systems has lead to a focus on the
origin and nature of the ordered phases found in close prox-
imity to the superconducting phase. Particular attention has
been drawn to the “nematic” phase [1], where the four-fold
symmetry of the lattice is broken at a temperature Ts which
is higher than the striped antiferromagnetic ordering tempera-
ture TN in some materials [2]. There has been long discussion
about whether these two transitions are both magnetic in ori-
gin, or whether Ts corresponds to a separate orbital instability
[1]. FeSe is an exceptional case, since it undergoes a struc-
tural transition at Ts = 90 K without long range magnetic order
at any temperature, enabling detailed study of the symmetry-
broken state [3–10], and has therefore attracted much theoret-
ical attention [11–17].

Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES)
measurements of FeSe [18–27] provide direct experimental
access to the evolution of the electronic structure through Ts,
which can be linked to theoretical models of the underly-
ing symmetry-breaking order. Most previous ARPES studies
have paid particular attention to the electron pockets around
the M point, and inferred a ∼49 meV splitting of dxz and
dyz bands, similar to previous claims in NaFeAs [28] and
Ba(Fe1−xCox)2As2 [29]. In this scenario, the bands of pri-
marily dxz and dyz character are degenerate exactly at M in
the high temperature phase [30], but are proposed to split be-
low Ts. Then, the dispersions observed by ARPES all arise
from dxz or dyz bands, taking into account the presence of
twin domains in the sample, with the understanding that outer
electron band with dxy character should not contribute [22].
In the simplest case, this would associate a 49 meV energy
scale with a uniform symmetry-breaking dxz − dyz orbital po-
larisation on the Fe sites, i.e. a ferro-orbital ordering [14, 22].
While this has been recently questioned [25], and other inter-
pretations have also been proposed [11, 25, 31–33], the split-
ting of dxz and dyz bands at the M point has been considered
a hallmark of the nematic phase, until now [20–22, 24].

In this letter, we present a high-resolution ARPES study of
the evolution of the electronic structure of bulk FeSe through

the nematic transition at Ts. We use curvature analysis and
a new procedure to ﬁt the Energy Dispersion Curves (EDCs)
at the M point to extract band positions. We also consider
the kz dependence of the electron pockets, and present new
Fermi surface maps covering the whole Brillouin zone above
and below Ts. While the hole pockets of FeSe do undergo sig-
niﬁcant symmetry-breaking distortions below Ts, the changes
to the electron pockets arise from an additional separation of
existing dxz/yz and dxy bands, without any resolvable lifting
of dxz-dyz band degeneracy. These observations exclude the
ferro-orbital scenario, and place new strong constraints on the
nature of the orbital ordering. Finally use a 5-orbital tight
binding model to propose that the nematic state of FeSe is
characterised by a stripe antiferro-orbital order.

Samples were grown by the chemical vapor transport
method [3, 22, 34]. ARPES measurements were performed
at the I05 beamline at the Diamond Light Source, UK.

In Fig. 1a-d) we present temperature-dependent ARPES
data for a high symmetry cut centred on the M point, also
showing the EDCs at M. At low temperatures (Fig. 1d)), these
EDCs display two prominent peaks with a splitting ∆M = 49
meV, previously attributed to dxz − dyz splitting, i.e. ∆F O
M =
Eyz − Exz. However, curvature analysis [35] enhances weak
features in the data and provides a different perspective, as
shown in Fig. 1f-i), which corresponds to the raw data in
Fig. 1a-d). Above Ts, in Fig. 1f) both the expected dxz and
dyz dispersions and also sections with dxy character are ob-
served. By comparing Fig. 1f-i), we observe the similarity
in the dispersions above and below Ts, and no extra features
arise. Therefore here we propose a new scenario, where the
low temperature dispersions simply consists of the dxz/yz and
dxy bands as expected above Ts, but with an increased sep-
aration between them. Therefore we assign the peaks in the
EDCs to the two bands, i.e. ∆M = Exz/yz − Exy, equal to 49
meV at low temperatures but also ﬁnite above Ts. Within ex-
perimental resolution (11 meV FWHM for the relevant peak
in Fig. 1d)) we cannot detect any subsequent splitting between
dxz and dyz bands, which could occur as a secondary effect.
This new scenario can be tested by the extraction of band

positions as a function of temperature from the EDCs at the M
point. However while the separation ∆M of the two features
in the EDC is unambiguous at low temperatures, it becomes
more difﬁcult to deﬁne at higher temperatures, as features be-
come broader. Here we take a new approach: we ﬁt the EDC
with two asymmetric pseudo-Voigt functions and the Fermi
function at 61 K where the peaks are still distinct. Then, at
higher temperatures we ﬁt using the same peak proﬁles, only
allowing the peak positions to vary (see Supplementary In-
formation, SI). We ﬁnd that the ﬁtted peak positions are sep-
arated by 20 meV even above Ts, but increase substantially
when the system enters the nematic phase (Fig. 1j). The sharp
upward shift of the dxz/yz bands at Ts is the strongest feature,
although the dxy band position also adjusts downwards below
Ts, leading to a total separation of 49 meV at 10 K.

In Fig. 1k-o) we present new measurements of the electron
pockets using a photon energy of 56 eV, where the outer dxy
electron dispersion is already clearly visible in the data above
Ts even without curvature analysis. The 56 eV photon en-
ergy is chosen to correspond to the A point at the top of the

Brillouin zone where the warped quasi-2D electron pocket is
largest, giving the best momentum-resolution of features, as
can be seen in Fig. 1e). Further detail of the photon-energy
dependence is presented in SI where it is also shown that ∆M
is independent of kz. In Fig. 1p) we extract the temperature-
dependence of both kF vectors observed, from peak ﬁtting of
the Momentum Distribution Curve (MDC) at the Fermi level
(SI). The kF values are well-deﬁned at all temperatures and
also demonstrate that the dyz and dxy dispersions are separate
above Ts and undergo additional separation below Ts.

In Fig. 2 we present further support for the new interpreta-
tion including the observation of the dxy electron band. These
ARPES data are obtained with the scattering plane at 45◦
to the Fe square lattice to mitigate matrix elements effects
[36], again using 56 eV photon energy. At 100 K, above
Ts, the Fermi surface maps (Fig. 2a,c) reveal essentially the
whole structure of the expected electron pockets at the A
point. High-symmetry cuts in the ZAZ direction (Fig. 2e,j,o)
taken from these maps give spectra which are consistent with
Fig. 1k-o). Moreover the cut in the RAR direction (Fig. 2d,i,n)

also supports the interpretation that a signiﬁcant additional
splitting between the dxy and dxz/yz bands at the M point
develops below Ts. The comparison between Fig. 2c) and m)
demonstrates that the low-temperature Fermi surface is elon-
gated compared to the high temperature case, but retains the
same basic structure and symmetry. Thus the electron pockets
retain fourfold symmetry and the bands from both structural
domains will overlap in experiments.

The evolution of the electron pockets through Ts contrasts
strongly with the behaviour of the hole pockets. At the Z
point (Fig. 2b), above Ts the inner hole pocket just crosses the
Fermi level, making a small 3D pocket [22, 24]. However be-
low Ts there is an extra splitting of ∼15 meV associated with
the orbital ordering in addition to the ∼20 meV splitting from
spin-orbit coupling at the Z point between the dxz/yz bands
which pushes the inner band completely below the Fermi level
(Fig. 2l). Therefore there is a single hole band at low temper-
atures which displays an elliptical distortion, however due to
the presence of twin domains below Ts, two crossed ellipses
are superposed in the ARPES data in Fig. 2f,k).

The breaking of fourfold rotational symmetry of the hole
pockets below Ts is therefore well-established. However, we
have found symmetry-preserving changes to the electronic
structure at the M point, which on ﬁrst sight are difﬁcult to
reconcile with the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition
at Ts. The challenge is to identify an orbital pattern which

globally breaks fourfold rotational symmetry but is consistent
with the strong constraints provided by these two observa-
tions. Ferro-orbital ordering could account for the symmetry-
breaking at the Γ point, but requires a splitting of dxz/yz
orbitals at the M point, which we have argued is not the
case. Moreover, ferro-orbital ordering is not consistent with
the direction of distortion of the hole band, as revealed by
ARPES measurements on detwinned crystals [25]. A N´eel-
type antiferro-orbital ordering would preserve the dxz/yz de-
generacy at M, but it cannot explain the extra splitting ob-
served between dxz/yz bands at the Γ/Z point [31], and can
also be ruled out on symmetry grounds. The recently pro-
posed d-wave bond nematic order predicts a splitting at the
M point [31, 32], as does the microscopic model of Ref. [33].
However, we suggest that a striped antiferro-orbital ordering
pattern is compatible with all the observations.

In Fig. 3 we present tight-binding model electronic struc-
tures with and without the proposed striped antiferro-orbital
ordering pattern. We use a 2D ﬁve-orbital tight binding model
including spin-orbit coupling, adapted from Refs. [14, 37]
(SI). Within this model, we add an order parameter to the
Hamiltonian as h = ∆S(nyz − nxz) cos(kx) which accounts
for an orbital ordering pattern which alternates along the x di-
rection but is ﬁxed in the y direction. This term may include
contributions from both on-site energies and anisotropic hop-
ping terms. This order parameter, which could also be called a

model we obtain Fermi surfaces and dispersions which repro-
duce all qualitative features of the low-lying electronic struc-
ture. Therefore we suggest that the nematic state of FeSe may
be characterised by a stripe antiferro-orbital ordering.

Since the Fermi surface changes at the M point are not of
a symmetry-breaking nature, and ∆M is ﬁnite even above Ts,
there is an important question about how tightly the evolu-
tion of the electron pockets is linked to Ts. However we have
shown that there is a sharp increase in ∆M which onsets ex-
actly at Ts (Fig. 1j). Additionally, the deviation in kF values
of both the inner and outer electron pocket branches also fol-
lows a sharp order-parameter-like behaviour which onsets at
Ts, and this deviation of the inner pocket was shown to be-
have as an order parameter of the structural transition across
the FeSe1−xSx series [24]. This indicates that although the
changes at the M point are not fourfold symmetry-breaking in
nature, they are still fundamentally linked to the orthorhom-
bic lattice distortion. This apparent conundrum is resolved by
noting that with stripe antiferro-orbital ordering, the M point
is a special point in the Brillouin zone where the degeneracy is
not broken. Therefore the apparently non-symmetry breaking
band movements at M are linked to an ordering which glob-
ally does break tetragonal symmetry and therefore drives the
lattice distortion at Ts.

Within the longstanding debate about the roles of orbital
and spin degrees of freedom in Fe-based superconductors [1],
FeSe is often considered as an example where orbital inter-
actions may be dominant [3–5, 22].
Indeed, our observa-
tions can be interpreted as a form of charge-orbital instabil-
ity at (π,0), similar to previous suggestions [11, 38]. How-
ever this (π,0) orbital ordering has the same wavevector as
the incipient stripe antiferromagnetic ordering that ﬂuctuates
[6–9] but never stabilises in FeSe. This may suggest that
magnetic interactions are still relevant to the structural tran-
sition in FeSe. Speculatively, the observed (π,0) modulation
of the itinerant electrons, as seen by ARPES, could be the
manifestation in band space of a magnetically-driven Ising-
nematic order, or could indicate a coupling with (π,0) mag-
netic antiferro-quadrupolar ordering [13]. Indeed, the mag-
nitude of energy shifts (e.g. 20 meV for the dxz/yz bands at
M) are similar to the spin-orbit coupling value of 20 meV in
FeSe [22], suggesting that a spin-driven scenario is not ruled
out. However our data does exclude several proposed orbital
ordering scenarios, and instead points to the existence of a
striped antiferro-orbital ordered phase in FeSe, which is dis-
tinct from the known striped antiferromagnetic phase in other
Fe-based superconductors.

In conclusion, we have presented a high-resolution ARPES
study of FeSe, and argued that the symmetry-breaking dis-
tortion of the hole pockets at the Γ point but symmetry-
preserving changes of the electron pockets at the M point
below Ts point towards a striped antiferro-orbital ordering.
These measurements provide a fresh perspective on the nature
of the nematic phase of Fe-based superconductors.

“quadrupole charge density wave”, has the desired properties
of giving an extra splitting in addition to the spin-orbit cou-
pling splitting of dxz/yz bands at the Γ point, but a symmetric
shift up of the dxz/yz bands at the M point without losing the
degeneracy, while it still globally breaks fourfold rotational
symmetry (SI). In Fig. 3b,c) we present the results of a cal-
culation with ∆S = 20 meV; we also include an adjustment
of -10 meV to the dxy orbital which is motivated by the ex-
perimental results in Fig. 1 and may be required to maintain
the charge balance of the system. Within this fairly simple

Fitting of EDCs at the M point

FIG. 4. a-d) Representative ﬁts of EDCs following the procedure
described in the main text. Black star symbols indicate the peak po-
sitions of the ﬁt. e) Extracted peak positions plotted on top of raw
EDC data, as a function of temperature.

The extraction of band positions at the M point has been
an important part of previous studies of FeSe, where it has
been claimed that a split peak structure arises from a single
peak (i.e.
the degenerate dxz/yz bands at M) either at Ts
[20] or above Ts [21, 23]. In the main text we argued that
this is not the correct scenario, and that the EDC above Ts
must arise from two separate features, even if they are not
well-distinguished, and there is a well-deﬁned transition at Ts.
Other studies have typically used a second derivative analysis
to determine the band positions, but this can lead to unphysi-
cal ﬁndings of onset temperatures above Ts [21, 23]. As de-
scribed in the main text, for this study we decided to take a
novel approach to the problem by directly ﬁtting the EDC to
extract band positions.

At 61 K (Fig. 4a), the peaks are clearly distinct, and here
we perform a ﬁt to the data with two asymmetric pseudo-voigt
functions with additional background, multiplied by the Fermi
function - that is, with 14 free parameters such that the peak
proﬁles are very well ﬁtted. However, once this ﬁt is con-
verged, at higher temperatures we use exactly the same pa-
rameters (amplitude, peak width, asymmetry parameters and
background), except for an overall peak width term which is
ﬁxed to increase linearly with temperature to account for the
experimental increase in peak width with temperature. We
therefore extract the band positions above 61 K from a ﬁnal ﬁt
which has only the peak positions free - i.e. a ﬁt with only two
free parameters. Representative ﬁts are displayed in Fig. 4.
We decided that the slight loss in ﬁt quality is compensated
by the greater conﬁdence in the peak positions when these are
the only free parameters. Indeed, this procedure gives a sensi-
ble and systematic temperature-dependence of band positions
as shown in Fig. 1j of the main text, and is complementary to
the result of the MDC ﬁtting analysis. Note that this ﬁtting
method in principle could converge with both peaks at the

6

same position and summed intensity above Ts which would
be compatible with ferroorbital ordering and is therefore un-
biased between the two interpretations, but in fact the method
converges to be consistent with the revised interpretation with
a 20 meV splitting at the M point at higher temperatures be-
tween dxz/yz and dxy bands. The analysis of EDCs at the M
point has been a key point in thin ﬁlm ARPES studies, where
it is claimed that Tnematic can be much higher than in bulk
crystals [18, 23]. However it is clear that these data need to
be analysed in an appropriate way, and that many data points
near Ts are necessary to make ﬁrm conclusions. We suggest
that it would be generally preferable to instead use the more
straightforward analysis of MDCs to extract Ts, or to combine
ARPES measurements with other techniques which may be a
more direct probe of symmetry-breaking.

Fitting of MDCs at M

through the M point. Black lines represent the contributions of in-
dividual lorentzian peak proﬁles. e) Extracted kF values plotted on
raw MDC data stacked according to temperature.

In Fig. 5 we present MDC ﬁt proﬁles of the high-symmetry
cut through the M point at 56 eV, at representative temper-
atures, in order to show how the temperature-dependence of
kF was determined in Fig. 1p) of the main text. For the ﬁt
procedure, we use two pairs of Lorentzian peaks with equal
widths. We presented a similar analysis using 37 eV data in
Refs. [22, 24]. However at that photon energy the outer branch
has much weaker intensity (Fig. 1 of the main text) and cannot
be tracked up to Ts.

Photon Energy dependence at M

Here we present further details of the photon energy-
dependence of the electron bands at M point, at low temper-
atures in a twinned sample. The photon energy dependence
of the hole pockets of FeSe has been previously reported [22],
revealing a signiﬁcant kz dependence of the outer hole pocket.
At the M point, the Fermi surface shows a smaller warping ef-
fect, as the kF of the outer pocket shrinks from 0.193 ˚A−1 (56

eV - A point) to 0.142 ˚A−1 (42 eV - M point). This supports
the analysis of quantum oscillation frequencies [10, 22] where
it was determined that the electron pocket was less dispersive
in kz. It is interesting to note that the energy splitting at the
M point appears to be kz-independent, as shown in Fig. 6b).
This indicates that the orbital ordering has no signiﬁcant kz
dependence. Thus the band positions at the M point do not
change signiﬁcantly with kz, but the effective mass of the dis-
persion of the outer electron band from the M point does rise
with kz, giving rise to the warping of the Fermi surface. This
can be directly observed by comparing the cuts at different
photon energies shown in Fig. 6c-e), where the most substan-
tial difference between them is the dxy band dispersion. Note
that one previous measurement of the kz dependence at the M

point did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant kz dependence at the M-A
point [27], which we ﬁnd surprising. Taking into account the
kz dispersions of both the hole and electron pockets, we de-
termine that the inner potential (V0) appropriate for FeSe is
approximately 12.2 eV.

Tight binding model

In the main text, we presented Fermi surfaces and band dis-
persions for a 5-orbital tight binding model, in the form origi-
nally proposed in Ref. [37]. The parameters of Ref. [14] were
used as a starting point, with some adjustments made in or-
der to better match (by eye) the ARPES dispersions. In prac-

and M are described well; however some details such as the
dispersion of the dxy hole band are less well captured. We
show the folded electronic structure, i.e. we overlay bands
arising from ψ(k) and ψ(k + (π, π)). Thus our model does
not capture certain features which are found in a full 10-orbital
model, such as the small spin-orbit induced splitting of the
electron pockets in the M-X direction, which means that the
electron pockets should technically be considered as inner and
outer bands rather than the two crossed ellipses.

We now discuss the motivation behind the inclusion of a
stripe antiferro-orbital term in our tight binding model to un-
derstand the ARPES data. We chose to add the following term
to the 5-orbital model Hamiltonian:

h = ∆S(nyz − nxz) cos(kx).

(1)

Here the x direction corresponds to a Fe-Fe direction and
the longer a axis of the orthorhombic unit cell. Therefore,
in real space this order parameter could arise from an on-site
dxz − dyz orbital order that varies in sign between neighbour-
ing Fe sites along the x direction, but not in the y direction;
hence ”stripe antiferro-orbital ordering”.

In the 5-orbital model, the two crossed ellipses that occur
at the M point in the crystallographic 2-Fe unit cell are un-
folded to different positions in momentum space; the pockets
containing dxz and dyz character exist at (0,±π) and (±π, 0)
respectively. Experimentally, we have determined that these
two ellipses must distort symmetrically. This could not oc-
cur for an order parameter deﬁned homogeneously across the
Brillouin zone, e.g. a ferro-orbital ordering, since the two
pockets would distort in opposite directions due to their differ-

8

ent orbital characters. Therefore we considered momentum-
dependent order parameters, and in particular a cos(kx) term
ensures that the orbital splitting has different signs at (π, 0)
and (0, π). Due to the distinction in the orbital character at
each electron pocket, this makes band shifts at each point oc-
cur symmetrically, and when folding back to the M point of
the 2-Fe Brillouin zone, the Fermi surface has become more
elongated as in experiment but the degeneracy of dxz − dyz
bands is not broken. A cos(ky) momentum-dependence could
also give symmetric shifts at the M point, however this would
lead to the opposite distortions of the hole pocket compared
to measurements on detwinned single crystals [25].

Experimentally, the sections of Fermi surface with dxy
character also shift, although relatively less. We accounted
for this with a 10 meV downwards shift of the dxy orbital
energy in the tight-binding model. One way to understand
this is by noting that the total volume of the Fermi surface
must be approximately conserved in the nematic phase since
the distortion of the hole pocket is approximately symmetry-
preserving. Therefore a downward shift of the dxy electron
band dispersion could simply be a necessary consequence of
the upward shift of both the dxz and dyz bands. However al-
ternative interpretations could be possible.
Finally we note that our model indicates that spin-orbit cou-
pling gaps out the dxy − dxz band crossing slightly away from
M, which has elsewhere been proposed as a Dirac point. This
can also be directly observed in the data, where band discon-
tinuities are observed at the crossing points of dxz and dxy
bands, e.g. in Fig. 5. In fact the spin-orbit induced splitting
is of comparable magnitude to the Fermi energy and therefore
we question whether the Dirac description can be appropriate
for these points.
