We present in detail the Einstein equations in the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura
formulation for the case of D dimensional spacetimes with SO(D − d) isometry based
on a method originally introduced in.1 Regularized expressions are given for a numeri-
cal implementation of this method on a vertex centered grid including the origin of the
quasi-radial coordinate that covers the extra dimensions with rotational symmetry. Ax-
isymmetry, corresponding to the value d = D − 2, represents a special case with fewer
constraints on the vanishing of tensor components and is conveniently implemented in
a variation of the general method. The robustness of the scheme is demonstrated for
the case of a black-hole head-on collision in D = 7 spacetime dimensions with SO(4)
symmetry.

1. Introduction

For most of its history, numerical relativity, i.e., the construction of solutions to
Einstein’s ﬁeld equations with numerical methods, was mainly motivated by the
modeling of compact objects as sources of gravitational waves2 for ground based
[Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), Virgo] and space
based [Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)] detectors; see for example.3, 4
Following the breakthroughs in black-hole (BH) binary simulations in 2005,5–7 how-
ever, the ﬁeld rapidly expanded into a variety of new physics frontiers.8

These applications often involve higher-dimensional spacetimes where BHs are
known from (semi-)analytic studies to exhibit a richer phenomenology as for exam-

ple through the existence of topologically non-spherical horizons or gravitational
instabilities.9 Despite considerable progress through analytic, perturbative and nu-
merical methods, our understanding of the properties of these higher-dimensional
BHs is still a long way from the level of maturity obtained in the four-dimensional
case. Yet, applications of numerical relativity to BHs in D > 4 have already revealed
a plethora of exciting results.

Critical spin parameters have been identiﬁed above which Myers-Perrya BHs
become unstable to bar mode perturbations and migrate to more slowly spinning
BHs via GW emission.11, 12 The celebrated Gregory-Laﬂamme instability13 has been
shown to lead to the formation of naked singularities in ﬁnite asymptotic time in
numerical simulations of black strings in D = 5 dimensions.14 Most recently, a
similar behaviour has been identiﬁed in evolutions of thin black rings demonstrating
the ﬁrst violation of cosmic censorship for a generic type of asymptotically ﬂat initial
data;15 see also16 for a perturbative study. Applications of the gauge-gravity duality
often consider D = 5 dimensional BHs in asymptotically Anti de Sitter (AdS)
spacetimes such that the dual Conformal Field Theory (CFT) lives on the D = 4
dimensional (conformal) boundary of the spacetime. Applications of this AdS/CFT
correspondence include the thermalization of quark-gluon plasma, turbulence or jet
quenching in heavy-ion collisions; see17–22 and references therein.

BH collisions provide fertile ground for numerical relativity in higher dimensions.
First, we obtain unprecedented insight into the dynamics of general relativity in its
most violent, non-linear regime. Furthermore, the so-called TeV gravity scenarios
provide solutions to the hierarchy problem in terms of large (∼ sub millimeter)
extra dimensions23–25 or inﬁnite extra dimensions with a warp factor26, 27 which
are accessible to gravity but no other standard-model interactions. If correct, these
theories open up the possibility of BH formation in particle collisions or in cosmic
ray showers.28–30 Valuable input for the analysis of experimental data at the Large
Hadron Collider includes the scattering cross-section and energy loss in GWs. Nu-
merical relativity has provided us with a rather comprehensive understanding of
these collisions in D = 4,31–39 which the community now starts extending to higher
D.40–43 For more details on these new areas in numerical relativity research see.8

Numerical simulations of BH spacetimes in higher dimensions are a challenging
task. First and foremost this is simply a consequence of the required computational
resources. Simulations in D = 4 require of the order of O(102) cores and O(102) Gb
of memory. Each extra spatial dimension introduces an additional factor of O(102)
grid points and correspondingly more memory and ﬂoating point operations. Even
with modern high-performance computing systems, this sets practical limits on
the feasibility of accurately evolving higher-dimensional spacetimes. At the same
time, many of the outstanding questions can be addressed by imposing symmetry
assumptions on the spacetimes in question such as planar symmetry in modeling
asymptotically AdS spacetimes,18 cylindrical symmetry for black strings14 or dif-

ferent types of rotational symmetries.15 This can be achieved in practice by either
(i) using a speciﬁc form of the line element that directly imposes the symmetry in
question (see e.g.18), (ii) starting with a generic line element and applying dimen-
sional reduction through isometry (see e.g.44–46) or (iii) implementing the symmetry
through a so-called Cartoon method.47 Here we are concerned with the latter ap-
proach and, more speciﬁcally, with a modiﬁcation thereof originally introduced in1
(see also12, 48, 49) which we will henceforth refer to as the modiﬁed Cartoon method.
This article is structured as follows. In Sec. 2, we introduce the notation used
throughout our work, and illustrate the modiﬁed Cartoon implementation of the
symmetries for a speciﬁc example. In Sec. 3 we introduce the Baumgarte-Shapiro-
Shibata-Nakamura50, 51 (BSSN) evolution system we use for the Einstein equations,
and derive their speciﬁc form in SO(D − d) symmetry when rotational symmetry
is present in ≥ 2 planes which corresponds to d < D − 2. The axisymmetric case
d = D− 2 imposes less restrictive conditions on the vanishing of tensor density com-
ponents and their derivatives and the particulars of its numerical implementation
are discussed in Sec. 4. As an example, we present in Sec. 5 numerical simulations
of a BH head-on collision in D = 7 dimensions employing SO(4) symmetry. We
summarize our ﬁndings in Sec. 6 and include in three appendices a list of impor-
tant relations for the components of tensors and derived quantities as well as the
regularization necessary at the origin in the quasi-radial direction.

2. SO(D − d) symmetry in the modiﬁed Cartoon method

2.1. Coordinates

It is instructive to illustrate the method by considering ﬁrst a simpler scenario: ax-
isymmetry in three spatial dimensions. Let (x, z, w) denote Cartesian coordinates
and assume rotational symmetry about the x axisb i.e., there exists a rotational
Killing ﬁeld in the z, w plane. Evidently, the geometry of such a three-dimensional
manifold can be constructed straightforwardly provided all tensors (e.g. the metric)
are known on the semi inﬁnite plane w = 0, z ≥ 0, x ∈ R. We note the simpliﬁcation
in the computational task: the w coordinate has dropped out and the quasi-radius
z takes on only non-negative values, reducing an originally three-dimensional com-
putational domain to a calculation on half of R2. This is the case considered in the
original papers.1, 47

The most common applications will likely consider higher-dimensional space-
times with SO(D − 3) symmetry, but here we present the general application to a
D dimensional spacetime with SO(D − d) symmetry, where d ∈ N, 1 ≤ d ≤ D − 2.
Let us then consider a D dimensional spacetime consisting of a manifold M and
a metric gAB of signature D − 2 where A, B, . . . = 0, . . . , D − 1. We assume the

bIt is more common to label the coordinates (x, y, z) and use symmetry about the z axis, but our
choice of labels emphasizes more clearly the analogy to the higher-dimensional case.

where ˆi = 1, . . . d − 1, a = d + 1, . . . , D − 1. SO(D − d) symmetry implies the
existence of rotational Killing vectors in each plane spanned by two of the coordi-
nates (z, wa). In complete analogy with the axisymmetric scenario discussed above,
it is now suﬃcient to provide data on the d-dimensional semi-inﬁnite hyperplane

wa = 0, xˆi ∈ R, z ≥ 0. The components of a tensor at any point in the spacetime

can then be obtained by appropriately rotating data from the hyperplane onto the
point in question.

In modeling spacetimes with such symmetries, it is therefore entirely suﬃcient
to compute data on the hyperplane which largely solves the problem of increased
computational cost mentioned in the introduction. There remains, however, the
diﬃculty that the Einstein equations, irrespective of the speciﬁc formulation one
chooses, contain derivatives of tensor components in the wa directions which cannot
be evaluated numerically in the usual fashion, as for example using ﬁnite diﬀerences
or spectral methods. Furthermore, the number of tensor components present in the
Einstein equations still increases rapidly with the dimension parameter D resulting
in a substantial increase of memory requirements and ﬂoating point operations.
Both of these diﬃculties are overcome by exploiting the conditions imposed on the
tensor components and their derivatives by the SO(D − d) symmetry. It is these
conditions which we address next. It turns out to be convenient in this discussion
to distinguish between (1) the case d = D − 2 corresponding to SO(2) isometry,
and (2) all remaining cases d < D − 2. We defer discussion of the special case
d = D − 2 to Sec. 4 where we present a numerical treatment speciﬁcally designed
for conveniently dealing with it. The description of this treatment will be simpler
after ﬁrst handling the class of symmetries with d < D − 2 which we discuss in the
remainder of this and in the next section.

2.2. Tensor components in SO(D − d) symmetry for d < D − 2

The key ingredient we use in reducing the number of independent tensor compo-
nents and relating their derivatives are the rotational Killing vectors and the use of
coordinates adapted to the integral curves of these Killing vectors. The method is
best introduced by considering a concrete example. Let ξ denote the Killing vector
ﬁeld corresponding to the rotational symmetry in the (z, w) plane, where w ≡ wa
for some ﬁxed number a ∈ {d + 1, . . . , D − 1}. We introduce a new coordinate sys-
tem that replaces (z, w) with cylindrical coordinates and leaves all other coordinates

z = ρ cos ϕ ,

w = ρ sin ϕ .

(4)

In these coordinates, the Killing ﬁeld is ξ = ∂ϕ and the vanishing of the Lie deriva-
tive LξgAB = 0 implies ∂ϕgAB = 0. Note that quantities constructed from the
spacetime metric directly inherit this property. This applies, in particular, to the
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner52 (ADM) – see also53, 54 – and the BSSN variables widely
used in numerical relativity. For d < D − 2, one can furthermore show that the
ϕ component of a vector ﬁeld and those components of a tensor ﬁeld TAB, where
exactly one index is ϕ, vanishc.

The concrete example we now discuss in more detail concerns a symmetric tensor
density TAB of weight W and, in particular, the mixed components Tiw, where the
index i stands for any one of the (xˆi, z) coordinates and w stands for one of the wa.
We ﬁrst consider the components Tˆiw for some ﬁxed value of ˆi. Transforming the
component ¯Tˆiϕ to Cartesian coordinates, one gets

¯Tˆiϕ = DW ∂X A
∂ ¯Xˆi

∂X B
∂ϕ

TAB = DW (−w Tˆiz + z Tˆiw) ,

where D is the Jacobian det(∂X A/∂ ¯X B) = ρ. Using that ¯Tˆiϕ = 0 by symmetry, this
equation implies

Tˆiw =

w
z

Tˆiz .

(6)

Similarly, transforming ¯Tρϕ to Cartesian coordinates and using that ¯Tρϕ = 0 by
symmetry, one straightforwardly gets

zw

(7)

Tzw =

z2 − w2 (Tzz − Tww) .

Recalling that the computational domain is the hyperplane wa = 0, xˆi ∈ R, z ≥ 0,
we conclude from Eqs. (6),(7) that on the computational domain Tiw = 0. This
argument holds for any speciﬁc choice of the coordinate w, so that we conclude

Tia = 0 .

(8)

To compute the derivatives with respect to w on the w = 0 hyperplane, one can
proceed as follows. For the tensor components in the example above, one can simply
use (6) and (7) to calculate ∂wTia and then set w = 0. Alternatively, writing the
Killing ﬁeld ξ as

ξ = z ∂w − w ∂z ,

(9)

cHere the case d = D − 2 represents an exception; an axisymmetric, toroidal magnetic ﬁeld, for
example, satisﬁes SO(2) symmetry, but has a non-vanishing ϕ component.

and imposing the vanishing of the Lie derivative LξTia = 0 on the w = 0 hyperplane,
one gets

∂wTiw =

Tiz − δizTww

z

.

(10)

Repeating this process for all components of scalar, vector and rank 2 tensor den-
sities as well as their ﬁrst and second derivatives, we get the relations summarized
in Appendix A.

We have shown the calculation here explicitly for the case of tensor densities.
It can be shown that the vectorial expressions thus obtained also apply to the
MN constructed from the metric, even
contracted Christoﬀel symbol ΓA ≡ gMN ΓA
though it is not a vector density.

3. Dimensional reduction of the BSSN equations

In this section, we will apply the symmetry relations obtained above to the speciﬁc
case of the BSSN formulation of the Einstein equations in D spacetime dimensions.
We emphasize, however, that the procedure spelled out here for the BSSN system
can be applied in similar form to any of the alternative popular formulations used
in numerical relativity.

3.1. The D dimensional BSSN equations
The starting point for the BSSN formulation is a space-time, or (D − 1) + 1, split
where the spacetime is foliated in terms of a one-parameter family of D − 1 dimen-
sional, spatial hypersurfaces. In coordinates adapted to this split, the line element
takes on the form

ds2 = gABdxAdxB = (α2 + βIβ I)dt2 + 2βIdxIdt + γIJdxIdxJ ,

(11)

where I, J, . . . = 1, . . . , D − 1 and α and β I denote the lapse function and shift
vector, respectively. The ADM equations in the form developed by York53 then
result in one Hamiltonian constraint, D− 1 momentum constraints and D(D− 1)/2
second-order evolution equations for the spatial metric components γIJ . The latter
are formulated as a ﬁrst-order-in-time system by introducing the extrinsic curvature
KIJ through

∂tγI J = βM ∂M γIJ + γM J∂IβM + γIM ∂JβM − 2αKIJ .

(12)

Space-time decompositions of the Einstein equations typically split the energy mo-
mentum tensor analogously into time, space and mixed components according to
ρ ≡ TABnAnB ,

B+nDnB)TCD ,
(13)
where nA denotes the future pointing, timelike unit normal ﬁeld on the spatial
hypersurfaces. The complete set of the ADM equations, thus obtained, can be found
as Eqs. (52)-(55) in.8

The BSSN system is obtained from the ADM equations by applying a conformal

promotion of the contracted spatial Christoﬀel symbols to the status of evolution

χ, following.7 Alternative versions of the equations using variables W ≡ √χ or
φ ≡ −(ln χ)/4 can be found in.55, 56 Note that the deﬁnition of the BSSN variables
in (14) implies two algebraic and one diﬀerential constraints given by

The BSSN equations in this form are general and facilitate the numerical construc-
tion of D dimensional spacetimes. Next, we will describe in detail how the equations
can be reduced to an eﬀective system in d spatial dimensions for spacetimes obeying
rotational symmetry with d < D − 2.

3.2. The BSSN equations with SO(D − d) symmetry for d < D − 2

We now apply the relations summarized in Appendix A to the deﬁnition of the
BSSN variables (14) and the D dimensional BSSN equations (18)-(22). Recalling
that early and middle Latin indices run over a, b, . . . = d + 1, . . . , D − 1 and

The BSSN equations in this form can readily be implemented in an existing “d+1”
BSSN code with the addition of merely two new ﬁeld variables, ˜γww and ˜Aww. While
the BSSN equations acquire additional terms, the computational domain remains
d-dimensional. Furthermore, the entire set of Eqs. (31)-(51) contains exclusively
derivatives in the xi directions and in time, which can be evaluated without need
of ghost zones in the extra dimensions.

There only remains one further subtlety arising from the explicit division by
z in several of the terms present. Some (though not all) numerical codes require
evaluation of these expressions at z = 0 which makes regularization of these terms
mandatory. As we show explicitly in Appendix B, this can be achieved for all terms,
yielding expressions that are exact in the limit z → 0. The results we discuss in
Sec. 5 make use of these regularized terms on the plane z = 0 demonstrating that
this procedure provides stable and accurate evolutions.

We conclude this section with a brief remark of the matter terms present in
(31)-(51) in the form of the projections ρ, ji, Sij and S = χ(˜γij Sij + n˜γwwSww) of
the energy-momentum tensor. The speciﬁc form of these terms will depend on the
physical system under consideration and will need to be evaluated separately for
each case as will the precise form of the matter evolution equations resulting from
the conservation law ∇AT AB. Many applications of higher-dimensional numerical
relativity concern BHs and the example application discussed in Sec. 5 will be an
asymptotically ﬂat vacuum spacetime where the matter terms and the cosmological
constant are zero.

4. The special case of SO(2) symmetry
We now return to the special situation where d = D−2 which corresponds to SO(2)
isometry, i.e. axisymmetric spacetimes.1 This case is special in that ϕ components
of a vector ﬁeld or those components of a tensor ﬁeld TAB where exactly one index
is ϕ, do not necessarily vanish. The reason for this exceptional property of SO(2)
symmetry is that with only one Killing vector ∂ ϕ, the vector f (xi) ∂ϕ, for an ar-
bitrary function f , trivially satisﬁes the symmetry as it commutes with all Killing
vectors. Thus, SO(2) symmetry does not, in general, cause any tensor components
to vanish, and only a negligible amount of computational cost and memory would be
saved by explicitly inserting the modiﬁed Cartoon terms, as derived in the previous
two sections, into the BSSN equations. We are still able, however, to capitalize on
the substantial reduction in memory and ﬂoating point operations that arises from
the dimensional reduction of the computational domain. This is most conveniently
achieved by retaining the BSSN equations in their full D-dimensional form and only
using the modiﬁed Cartoon method to ﬁll in derivatives that cannot be calculated
directly on the computational grid.

Let us illustrate this process for D = 5 with SO(2) isometry. Due to the symme-

try, we can model such a spacetime on a three-dimensional grid on which we store
all vector and tensor components, including those of the type V w and TIw, which
do not vanish for SO(2) symmetry. In order to evolve the system by one time step,
we need to compute derivatives with respect to all coordinates. Derivatives with
respect to xi can be calculated on the grid using standard methods. Derivatives
with respect to w, on the other hand, can be calculated on our three-dimensional
grid using the modiﬁed Cartoon method. For example, for a vector, the procedure
is

.




(52)

Appendix C lists all necessary expressions for derivatives with SO(2) symmetry.
Once all derivatives have been calculated, we have all the information required to
use the standard D = 5 BSSN equations (18-22) without the need for any extra
terms.

Note that this method for handling SO(2) symmetry can straightforwardly be
combined with the method described in Secs. 2, 3. Such a procedure can handle,
for example, the symmetry of black rings and has been applied in15 to speed up
the exploration of the gauge parameter space in numerical evolutions of black rings
in D = 5. Black rings have horizons of topology58 S1 × S2 and rotate along the
S1. This rotational symmetry requires handling with the special method for d =
D − 2 because ϕ components do not vanish in that case. The second symmetry
corresponding to the S2, however, is amenable to the treatment presented in Secs. 2
and 3. In practice, Refs.15, 59 ﬁrst applied the latter reduction and then the special
SO(2) reduction sketched in Eq. (52).

5. Application to a black-hole collision

In this section we present, as a speciﬁc example for the eﬃcacy of the formalism,
results from the numerical simulation of a head-on collision of two non-spinning
BHs in D = 7 dimensions starting from rest. A non-rotating BH in D spacetime
dimensions is described by the Tangherlini60 solution

here has been obtained using SO(4) symmetry, i.e. D = 7, d = 3, for a collision along
the x axis of two equal-mass BHs initially separated by 7.58 Rh, where Rh is the
horizon radius associated with a single BH with µ = µ1 = µ2. The computational
domain consists of a set of seven reﬁnement levels, the innermost two centered on
the BHs and the ﬁve outer ones on the origin. We employ standard moving puncture

having initialized lapse and shift to their Minkowski values α = 1, βi = 0. Two
simulations have been performed in octant symmetry with a grid spacing ∆x =
Rh/52 and ∆x = Rh/104, respectively, on the innermost level, that increases by a
factor of two on each consecutive level further out.

Figure 1 shows the trajectories of the two BHs evolving in time from the initial
separation through merger into a single hole centered on the origin, obtained from
the high resolution simulation with ∆x = Rh/104. In order to check the consistency
of our numerical formalism, we have also analyzed the constraint equations for this
conﬁguration. A snapshot of the Hamiltonian constraint (16) along the collision
axis at evolution time t = 80 Rh is shown in Fig. 2. In this ﬁgure, the result ob-
tained for the high resolution run has been ampliﬁed by a factor of four expected
for second-order convergence. The overlap of the two curves demonstrates conver-
gence at second order, compatible with the numerical scheme that employs second
and fourth-order accurate discretization and interpolation techniques. We have per-
formed the same analysis for the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints at several
points in time and observe the same second-order convergence of both constraints

6. Conclusions

In the presence of rotational symmetry, the Einstein equations simplify considerably
and the generation of numerical solutions to these equations can be implemented
with signiﬁcant improvements in computational cost and the required amount of
computer memory. The Cartoon method proposed in47 was the ﬁrst technique de-
signed with the particular goal of eﬃciently modeling axisymmetric spacetimes
in 3+1 numerical relativity. A modiﬁcation, often dubbed the modiﬁed Cartoon
method1 used relations between tensor components in place of spatial interpolation
operations, which not only eliminates the need of introducing a few extra grid points
in the symmetry directions, but also allows for a particularly convenient general-
ization to an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions and number of rotational
symmetries.12, 48, 49

In this work, we have presented in detail the complete set of equations as ob-
tained for the BSSN formulation of the Einstein equations in D spacetime dimen-
sions with SO(D − d) isometry where d ∈ {1, 2, . . . , D − 2}. Furthermore, we
explicitly demonstrate the presence of extra terms for the case d = D − 2, where
the symmetry condition allows for a wider class of components of tensor densities
to remain non-zero. Finally, we have compiled a list of terms involving division by
the quasi-radial coordinate (the z direction in our case) and illustrate how all ir-
regularities at the origin z = 0 can be cured through equivalence with manifestly
regular expressions. Even though we used the BSSN formulation for our discussion,
the recipes detailed here can be applied straightforwardly to other popular formu-
lations of the Einstein equations such as the generalized harmonic gauge1, 69 or the
conformal Z470, 71 systems.

As an example, we have presented results from a head-on collision from rest
of two equal-mass, non-spinning BHs in D = 7 spacetime dimensions. Following
a rather slow acceleration phase, due to the rapid diminishing of the gravitational
force with distance, the two BHs merge and we observe second-order convergence
of the constraints. This conﬁrms in yet another type of application the remarkable
robustness observed for the modiﬁed Cartoon method in applications to spinning
BHs12 or high-energy collisions in D = 5.42 This seemingly superior robustness as
compared with the method of reduction by isometry developed in45 is, at present,
empirical but merits further investigation at the analytic level.

symmetry with d < D − 2. The index range for early Latin indices is a, b, . . . = d +

Dimensional reduction in numerical relativity: Modiﬁed cartoon formalism and regularization 17

Appendix B. Regularization at z = 0 for d < D − 2

The presence of z in the denominator of several terms in the system of Eqs. (31)-
(51) merely arises from the quasi-radial nature of the coordinate z and can be
handled straightforwardly in analogy to the treatment of the origin in spherical or
axisymmetry.

We will present the regularized terms needed in the generic SO(D−d) symmetry;
however, it should be noted that terms involving the inverse metric become much
more complicated for a large d, and so we will also explicitly show these terms for
the most common case, d = 3.

We ﬁrst require that all components expressed in a fully Cartesian set of co-
ordinates are regular. A well known consequence of this assumption is that tensor
density components containing an odd (even) number of radial, i.e. z, indices con-
tain only odd (even) powers of z in a series expansion around z = 0. The same holds
for quantities derived from tensors and densities such as the BSSN variable ˜Γ i.

Next, we consider the inverse metric which we obtain through inversion of the
matrix equation (30). By constructing the cofactor matrix and dividing by the
determinant, we obtain, for d = 3

˜γxx = ˜γn

Next, we recall that the BSSN metric has unit determinant, so that

∗= ˜γn

where we introduced the symbol “ ∗= ” to denote equality in the limit z → 0. The

components for the inverse BSSN metric in Eq. (B.1) simplify accordingly.

For a general d we know that the matrix takes the form given in Eq (30). Then,
denoting the cofactor matrix for a given element of ˜γIJ as CIJ, the inverse BSSN
metric components are (note that the metric is symmetric, so that CI J = CJ I)

Again, in the BSSN case det ˜γIJ = 1, and the inverse metric element is simply
the cofactor of that element. For simplicity, we will use indices ˆi in place of xˆi in

the remainder of this section, so that, for example C12 ≡ Cx1x2, C1z ≡ Cx1z etc.
When used without a caret, the lower case Latin indices i, j, . . . also include the z
component.

If we denote the upper-left quadrant of the matrix in Eq (30) as the matrix Mij,

then we can write the cofactor of an element in this upper-left quadrant as

Cij = (−1)i+j ˜γn

ww det(Mkl{k6=j,l6=i}) .

(B.4)

Here, the notation det(Mkl{k6=j,l6=i}) denotes the determinant of the matrix obtained
by crossing out the jth row and ith column. Likewise, we may add further inequalities
inside the braces to denote matrices obtained by crossing out more than one row
and column.

The next regularity condition we require our spacetime to satisfy is the absence
of a conical singularity at z = 0. In polar coordinates (ρ, ϕ) constructed as in
Sec. 2.2, this condition can be expressed as ˜γϕϕ = ρ2˜γρρ which translates into the
conditions

˜γzz − ˜γww

∗= O(z2) ,

˜γzz − ˜γww ∗= O(z2) ,

(B.5)

in Cartesian coordinates. By taking the time derivative of these relations and com-
bining these with Eqs. (34), (35), we obtain an analogous relation for the traceless
extrinsic curvature,

˜Azz − ˜Aww

∗= O(z2) .

(B.6)

We thus arrive at the following list of regularized terms valid in the limit z → 0.
(1) By expanding βz = b1z + b3z3 + . . ., and likewise for ˜Γz and ∂z ˜γww, we obtain

derivatives as done for βz/z, to obtain

case i = ˆi does not arise which obviates the need to evaluate the determinant.

(8) Using ˜γww˜γzz − 1 = ˜γww(˜γzz − γww) = ˜γwwO(z2) and ˜γzˆi/z = ∂z ˜γzˆi, we can

(B.17)
(9) The term (˜γzz ˜γww − 1)/z2 requires slightly more work and we describe its
derivation here in a little more detail. We ﬁrst rewrite this term in the form

˜γzz ˜γww − 1

z2

= −˜γzz

˜γ zz − ˜γww

(B.18)

and express the inverse metric component ˜γzz in terms of the corresponding
cofactor matrix component and the determinant as

(B.19)

Note that these expressions are all valid for arbitrary values of z and we are
not yet using the BSSN condition det ˜γI J = 1. We can now plug this relation
into Eq. (B.18). We then trade divisions by z for derivatives with respect to z,
bearing in mind that ˜γzz = ˜γww + O(z2) and ﬁnd

Again, we formally set det(Mjl{j6=z,j6= ˆm,l6=i,l6=z}) = 1 for the case d = 2; cf. item
(2) above. Finally we use 1 = det ˜γIJ ⇒ Czz = ˜γzz to obtain

Appendix C. Cartesian components in SO(2) symmetry

The general case of SO(2) symmetry requires some modiﬁcations to the expressions
given in Appendix A. Here we list these necessary changes. Recall that lower case
Latin indices with a caret range from 1, ..., D − 3, since d = D − 2.

As for the case of SO(D−d) symmetry the above expressions need to be regularized
at z = 0. For Eqs. (C.1-C.3), we note that SO(2) symmetry implies that vector
components V w are odd functions of z on the w = 0 hyperplane. Therefore, the
regularization of vector components follows the procedure in Eqs. (B.7) and (B.12).
For the regularization of Eqs. (C.4-C.10), note that components of type Tˆiw
behave like vector components, that is they are odd functions of z. The component
Tzw, on the other hand, has to vanish at z = 0 and must be an even function of z.
The latter can be seen by contracting Tµν with two vectors pointing in the w and
z direction respectively. The result must be a scalar which satisﬁes the symmetry
and is therefore even. Together with the fact that z and w components of vectors
are odd this then implies that Tzw is even.

Combining these relations with those previously discussed in Appendix B, we
