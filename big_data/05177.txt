We present an atomistic description of the mechanism of the fcc–to–hcp transformation in solid
argon obtained from molecular dynamics transition path sampling simulations. We show that the
transition barrier at 40 K under ambient pressure is close to the thermal energy per atom. The anal-
ysis of the ensemble of reactive trajectories collected during the sampling revealed three transition
types. The average coordination number is used as order parameter and to monitor the progress of
the transformation. In each transition type, under– and over–coordinated atoms form and distribute
uniformly throughout the lattice during the transformation. Stacking disorder is discussed to de-
scribe the transition process and the cooperative atomic motions. The high activation energy for
collective movements of many atoms explains previous experimental observations of a sluggish bulk
transformations and diﬃculties of observation of the bulk transition at lower temperature and ambi-
ent pressure. The transition mechanism in bulk Ar is diﬀerent from Ar clusters as the orthorhombic
intermediate structure proposed for the latter is not observed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Rare gas solids (neon, argon, krypton, xenon) crys-
tallize in face–centered cubic (fcc) structures at ambi-
ent pressure and low temperatures1,2. However, early
experimental studies and theoretical predictions pointed
out the possibility of a hexagonally close–packed (hcp)
structure3–7. The hcp structure can coexist with fcc as
a metastable phase in pure rare gas solids at low tem-
peratures3–6 and becomes stable in solid solutions3,8,9.
Calculations based on two– and many–body interaction
potentials have predicted the hcp structure to be energet-
ically more favorable than the fcc polymorph10,11. This
stability order is reversed after including zero–point vi-
brational eﬀects10.

The stability of hcp structures is also supported by
high–pressure experiments12–18. Rare gas solids marten-
sitically transform from fcc to hcp before metalization un-
der pressure12–15. The pressure–induced fcc–to–hcp tran-
sition in RGSs is sluggish as the two phases coexist over
a wide range of pressures. X–ray diﬀraction and Raman
spectroscopy show a transformation pressure in the range
of 1.5–41 and 3.2–50 GPa for Xe and Kr, respectively,
and beyond 49.6 GPa for Ar12–14,16–18. Theoretically,
sluggishness of the fcc to hcp transformation in Xe was
attributed to high energy barrier19. This ﬁrst–principles
study determined the energy barrier for a stacking dis-
order growth pathway20 at lower pressure and an alter-
native pathway involving an orthorhombic distortion at
higher pressure.

Recent theoretical and experimental studies21–23 on
free clusters of inert gases investigated the relation be-
tween cluster size and the stability of the hcp structure.
It was shown that increasing the Ar cluster size led to a
transition from fcc to fcc/hcp mixed structures. An or-

thorhombic structure was predicted as intermediate in
the fcc–to–hcp transition.
It accounts for the diﬀrac-
tion peaks originating neither in fcc nor hcp structures
in Ar nanoclusters24. Although the fcc–to–hcp transition
mechanism was extensively studied for rare gas clusters,
a comprehensive understanding of this transformation in
the corresponding bulk materials is still elusive.

To answer these questions, we employ Transition Path
Sampling25,26 to provide detailed atomistic understand-
ing of the transition mechanisms and the ensuing struc-
tures.

II. SIMULATION DETAILS

For our transition path sampling molecular dynam-
ics simulations we used the TPS module from the US-
PEX package27–30 in combination with the LAMMPS
code31. During sampling, 7427 successful trajectories out
of 17334 trial moves were collected and used for analy-
sis. For each trajectory, molecular dynamics was car-
ried out using the velocity–Verlet algorithm with a time
step of 0.1 fs to ensure good reversibility. The simula-
tion system employed a Nose–Hoover thermostat with
a relaxation time of 30 fs and a Nose–Hoover barostat
with a relaxation time of 300 fs, ensuring an N pT en-
semble24 at T = 40 K and P = 1 bar. Anisotropic shape
changes of the simulations box containing 8000 Ar atoms
were allowed to avoid biasing the evolution of the dynam-
ics and the resulting transition mechanism. The inter-
atomic interactions were modeled using Lennard–Jones
12–6 model with Ar interaction parameters σ = 3.405 ˚A
and  = 0.238 Kcal/mole10,32, and truncated at 10 ˚A.

The Radial Distribution Function (RDF) can be used
as an Order Parameter (OP) to distinguish structures

The path is a trajectory connecting the stable states as
long as the RDFs of the initial and ﬁnal structures agree
with the fcc and hcp structure within tolerance, respec-
tively. For the structures along the trajectory, their RDF
diﬀerence from stable structures indicates their deforma-
tion.

The transition path sampling simulations were started
by an initial trajectory connecting the fcc and hcp phases
generated by the Variable–Cell Nudged Elastic Band
(VC–NEB)33 method.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Energetic Description of Phase Transition

By averaging over all accepted trajectories,

The enthalpy of the structures along a trajectory yield
the energetic description of the transition. Fig. 1(a)
shows the enthalpy change of a sample trajectory I
across the transition. The energy barrier is about
3.2 meV/atom, slightly lower than the thermal energy
(kT = 3.45 meV/atom) at 40 K showing that such a
transition is thermally feasible.
the
enthalpy for fcc and hcp structures are −69.89 ±
0.06 meV/atom, −69.85 ± 0.03 meV/atom respectively.
The peak enthalpy of the transition structures is −66.75±
0.05 meV/atom. The energy barrier for fcc→hcp transi-
tion is 3.12±0.07 meV/atom, which is comparable to the
thermal energy of 40 K. Despite the low energy barrier
per atom, the transition in bulk is expected to be slug-
gish, waiting for suﬃcient thermal ﬂuctuations to com-
plete the transition for all atoms. This is further clariﬁed
by the deﬁnition of the phase transition region and its
corresponding transition time.

coordinated atoms along trajectory I.

The crystal symmetry of the stable phases, fcc and hcp,
is clearly lost during the transformation. Two ways are
used here to analyze the deformation of the lattice and
the local packing in these structures.

The lattice deformation is measured by the structure
similarity to fcc and hcp. Radial Distribution Func-
tions g(r) are used as a simple but eﬀective description.
For the structure x along the transition trajectory, the
g(r) values are speciﬁed at a set of discrete distances
r = {r0, r1, . . . , rn}. The corresponding g(r) values form
−→
an RDF vector,
G x = [g(r0), g(r1), . . . , g(rn)]. Using the
previous concept of a ﬁngerprint descriptor34, the struc-
ture x’s similarity to fcc phase can then be determined

with a structure similarity function Sf cc(x),

Sf cc(x) =

−→
G x · −→
|−→
G x||−→

G f cc
G f cc|

(1)

which is the cosine distance between the RDF vector of
structure x and the fcc phase. The structure similarity
function ranges from 0 meaning totally uncorrelated, to
1 meaning identical; in–between values indicate interme-
diate similarity. The fcc–structure similarity criterion is
set to be 0.999, i.e. if Sf cc > 0.999 we identify a structure
as fcc. The similarity to the hcp phase is deﬁned analo-
gously. With this function, we distinguish the transition

structure from the two stable structures. The transition
region can thus be characterized for each trajectory.
Fig. 1(b) indicates the fcc→hcp transition along trajec-
tory I. The transition begins at 2.99 ps, when the struc-
ture loses its similarity to the fcc phase beyond the tol-
erance, and ends at 9.63 ps as the structure gains more
than 99.9% similarity to hcp. Along trajectory I, it takes
6.64 picoseconds to ﬁnish this transition. Note that these
times might not be corresponding to real times but can
be used to compare dynamics between diﬀerent trajecto-
ries. For all accepted transition trajectories, the average
transition time is 7.45 ± 1.17 picoseconds within the cell
of 8000 atoms.

The local packing along each trajectory is analyzed
through the percentages of diﬀerently coordinated atoms.
In fcc or hcp structures, the coordination number of each
atom is 12. Over– and under–coordinated atoms appear
during the transition.

Fig. 1(c) provides percentages of not–12–coordinated
atoms in the structures along trajectory I. After 2.99 ps,
the ratio of 12–coordinated atoms decreases.
Simul-
taneously, both over– and under–coordinated atoms,
mainly 13–coordinated and 11–coordinated atoms,
in-
crease. 14–coordinated atoms only appear brieﬂy; 9– and
10–coordinated atoms are almost negligible. These over–
and under–coordinated atoms in Fig. 1(c) represent the
production of local defects. The number of these defects
reaches its maximum when the 12–coordinated atoms are
at their lowest at 6.94 ps. After the 9.63 ps, the local
packing in the solid becomes 12-coordinated consistent
with the hcp phase.

In Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c), it is noticeable that the lat-
tice deforms immediately after the local packing begins
to change. The lattice has the maximum local defects
and the greatest deformation at the same time, followed
by a simultaneous relaxation into stable phase. This con-
sistency is observed in all three types of transition path-
ways.

2. Classiﬁcation of Transition Pathways and the

Mechanisms

We are deﬁning 3 types of transitions. Trajectory
I represents a Class I transition. The lattice deforms
slowly from the fcc phase to the transition state but re-
laxes quickly to the hcp phase. The growth and decay
rates of local defects dominate the transformation pro-
cess. Fig. 1(b) and (c) indicate the consistency between
the lattice deformation and local defects. When more
than 1.5% atoms become over– or under–coordinated the
lattice loses its similarity to fcc at 2.99 ps. According
to Fig. 1(a) and (c), the increasing enthalpy follows the
local packing change since the beginning of transition.
When the system reaches the local minimum in energy
at 6.25 ps more than 45% atoms are not regularly coor-
dinated. After waiting for suﬃcient thermal ﬂuctuations
to activate further local packing changes, more local de-

3

fects are generated to accelerate the lattice deformation.
When the system has the highest energy and largest num-
ber of local defects at 6.94 ps, the structure has least sim-
ilarity to both fcc and hcp phase. The lattice afterwards
quickly relaxes to the stable hcp phase. Although the av-
erage arrangement of atoms demonstrates the character
of hcp at 8.56 ps, the coordination numbers still stabi-
lize to 12 until 9.63 ps in order to dissipate the energetic
ﬂuctuations.

The transition region (yellow) of trajectory II. Structure
similarities to fcc and hcp phases are plotted in red and

blue separately. (c) The percentages of diﬀerently

coordinated atoms along trajectory II.

A Class II transition can be observed in trajectory II.
During transition, the lattice deformation and relaxation
take almost equal time. Based on the structure similar-
ity, the lattice begins to deform at 3.72 ps and reaches the

largest deformation 3.28 ps later. Then it takes 2.98 ps
to relax into the hcp phase. As shown in Fig. 2(a),
two metastable states appear during the lattice deforma-
tion and relaxation. The ﬁrst metastable state forms at
6.39 ps and soon accumulates thermal energy to produce
more local defects, which facilitate the following lattice
deformation. After overcoming the transition saddle at
7.00 ps, the lattice is trapped into a second metastable
state. But it just takes 0.39 ps to overcome the small en-
ergy barrier and quickly relax to the hcp phase at 9.98 ps.
The shortest pathway of all simulations is also in this
transition type, lasting only 3.87 ps.

Fig. 3(b) indicates a Class III transition,

in which

the lattice experiences a fast deformation and slow re-
laxation. Starting with a small thermal ﬂuctuation at
4.55 ps, only 2% of atoms becomes not–12–coordinated
until 5.66 ps. The structure still demonstrates 99.8%
similarity to fcc. However, induced by a large ﬂuctua-
tion from that moment, the lattice experiences a rapid
change. More than 55% atoms lose their regular coordi-
nation numbers within 1.6 ps. As a result, the transition
state has the largest deformation from both fcc and hcp
phases at 7.26 ps. A following increase of 12–coordinated
atoms reduces the local defects and leads to metastable
phase with more structural similarity to hcp phase at
7.91 ps. Another 0.51 ps is required to overcome the en-
ergy barrier. The lattice relaxation to hcp is completed
at 11.75 ps. The whole transition length characterized
through the structure similarity is 7.20 ps.

Looking at enthalpy proﬁles of three transformation
paths presented above, we can see that their activation
enthalpies are identical. From the enthalpy viewpoint
alone one could conclude that these paths have equal
chances to occur in reality, but this would ignore the
entropic factor. A simple and eﬀective way to judge the
likelihood of occurrence of each path, taking entropic fac-
tor into account is to count the frequency of occurrence
of each type of pathway. We ﬁnd that the percentage of
class I is 25.6%, class II is 13.0%, class III is 61.4% and
we therefore assume that class III is the most likely but
the other ones have a signiﬁcant share.

C. Type of Phase Transformation

For trajectory I, the distribution of diﬀerently coordi-
nated atoms along the transition is given in Fig. 4. At the
beginning, nearly all atoms in the fcc structure are 12–
coordinated. The lattice is characterized by a stacking
sequence . . . ABCABC. . . . Although the lattice deforma-
tion starts at 2.99 ps, the coordination numbers stay at
12 for more than 80% atoms until 5.18 ps. When the
thermal ﬂuctuation brings the system into a metastable
phase at 6.25 ps, more than 45% atoms become over–
or under–coordinated. After a short time, the system
reaches the peak in enthalpy at 6.94 ps with the most
changes to atomic coordination numbers. The generation
of suﬃcient defects in this process facilitates the follow-
ing lattice relaxation. After the largest deformation, the
structure quickly relaxes to hcp by 8.56 ps. But only at
9.63 ps all atoms again are 12–coordinated. The whole
system ends with the hcp phase at 14 ps with a stacking
sequence of . . . ABABAB. . . .

As observed in Fig. 4, the over– and under–coordinated
atoms appear in neighboring regions and these regions
form uniformly throughout. This initial step of the tran-
sition is similar for the other two classes.
It is notice-
able that the lattice deformation is changed consistently
with the local packing. There is cooperative movement
of many atoms that results in the fcc stacking growth
into hcp domains and the ﬁnal change in crystal struc-

ture. The stacking disorder growth mechanism was pre-
viously observed in experimental studies of fcc–to–hcp
transition of Xe and Kr13,20. A ﬁrst–principles calcula-
tion suggested this mechanism as the transition pathway
in Xe at lower pressure19. An X–ray diﬀraction study
on solid Ar up to 114 GPa predicted the development of
stacking disorder during the transition14. However, there
is still not enough evidence to prove this assumption as
the fcc–to–hcp transition in Ar requires extreme com-
pression above 49.6 GPa12–14,16–18. Our previous results
about the high energy barrier explains the inaccessibility
of this transition in bulk at ambient conditions.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Our results show that the transition energy barrier is
at the level of thermal energy for each atom to complete
fcc–to–hcp transformation in solid Ar at 40 K under am-
bient pressure. However, the activation energy required
for this transformation in bulk is beyond thermal ﬂuctu-
ations. Our average transition times are short in a cell of
8000 atoms, it will take much longer in real–sized sam-
ples. This is evidenced by experimental observations of
fast transitions in cluster but sluggish even unobserv-
able transition in bulk12–18,21–24,35. Structural analy-
sis in physical time demonstrates three diﬀerent tran-
sition pathways. These pathways all indicate the forma-

tion of over– and under–coordinated atoms, which lie in
neighboring regions and distribute uniformly through the
whole lattice. Unlike the transition in Ar clusters24 no or-
thorhombic intermediate is observed. Instead, we ﬁnd a
stacking disorder growth mechanism featured by the col-
lective movement of atoms and stacking sequence change
of lattice during transition. It is worth mentioning that
class III has the lowest number of not–12–coordinated
atoms and the least lattice deformation. We cannot ex-
clude that there might be some nucleation induced path-
ways as well available to the systems although we could
not identify a nucleus in any of our simulations.

The homogeneous growth of hcp phase from fcc phase
requires suﬃcient transition time for atoms to cooper-
atively overcome high energy barrier and transform to
the hcp phase. This phenomenon further explains the
sluggishness of fcc–to–hcp transformation in bulk Ar and
the missing observation of this bulk transition at lower
temperature without extreme compression.

The TPS method employed in our research provides a
precise atomic understanding of Ar phase transition. Our
results conﬁrm the experimental observations with theo-
retical support. Clearly, TPS can be extended to inves-
tigate the martensitic transformation mechanism of rare
gas solids under high pressure, which would be a signiﬁ-
cant advantage over previous studies19. We are conﬁdent
that the combination of experiments and computation is
a stimulating way to develop detailed insights into future

phase transition problems.
