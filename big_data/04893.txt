Performance Bounds for Nash Equilibria in Submodular Utility Systems

with User Groups

Yajing Liu, Edwin K. P. Chong, and Ali Pezeshki

Abstract— We consider two types of grouping among users
in utility systems. The ﬁrst type of grouping is from Chen
et al. (2014), where each user belongs to a group of users
having social ties with it. For this type of utility system, each
user’s strategy maximizes its social group utility function, giving
rise to the notion of social-aware Nash equilibrium. We prove
that, for a valid utility system, if the social utility function is
submodular, then any social-aware Nash equilibrium achieves
at least 1/2 of the optimal social utility, subject to a function-
dependent additive term. We further prove that if the social
utility function is nondecreasing and submodular, then any
social-aware Nash equilibrium achieves at least 1/(1 + c) of
the optimal social utility, where c is the curvature of the
social utility function. For the second type of grouping we
consider, the set of users is partitioned into l disjoint groups,
where the users within a group cooperate to maximize their
group utility function, giving rise to the notion of group Nash
equilibrium. We prove that, for a valid utility system, if the social
utility function is submodular, then any group Nash equilibrium
achieves at least 1/2 of the optimal social utility, subject to a
function-dependent additive term. By deﬁning the curvature cki
associated with group i with ki users, we show that if the social
utility function is nondecreasing and submodular, then any
group Nash equilibrium achieves at least 1/(1 + max1≤i≤l cki )
of the optimal social utility. Finally, we present an example of a
utility system for database assisted spectrum access to illustrate
our results.

I. INTRODUCTION

A variety of interesting practical problems can be posed as
utility maximization problems: these include facility location
(e.g., [1]), trafﬁc routing and congestion management (e.g.,
[2] and [3]), sensor selection (e.g., [4] and [5]), and network
resource allocation (e.g., [6]–[9]). In a utility maximization
problem, a set of users make decisions according to their
own set of feasible strategies, resulting in an overall social
utility value, such as proﬁt, coverage, achieved data rate, and
quality of service. The goal is to maximize the social utility
function. Often, the users do not cooperate in selecting their
strategies.

In general, it is impractical to ﬁnd the globally optimal
sequence (ﬁnite, ordered collection) of strategies maximizing
the social utility function. Typically, it is more useful to
consider scenarios where individual users or groups of users
separately maximize their own private objective functions,

and then ask how this compares with the globally optimal
case. The usual framework for studying such scenarios is
game theory together with its celebrated notion of Nash
equilibria. A Nash equilibrium is a sequence of strategies
(deterministic or randomized) for which no user can improve
its own private utility by changing its strategy unilaterally.
Nash [10] proves that any ﬁnite and noncooperative game
has at least one Nash equilibrium.

The question of how the Nash solution compares with the
globally optimal solution has received some attention in the
literature. Notable results have been reported by [11] and [12]
in the context of trafﬁc routing and congestion management,
which aims to minimize the total latency. For a general utility
maximization problem, Vetta [13] develops lower bounds on
the worst-case social utility value in noncooperative games.
Speciﬁcally, he proves that for a submodular social utility
function in a valid utility system, any Nash equilibrium
achieves at least 1/2 of the optimal social utility value, sub-
ject to a function-dependent additive term. He also shows that
for a nondecreasing and submodular social utility function
in a valid utility system, any Nash equilibrium can achieve
at least 1/(1 + c) of the optimal social utility function value,
where 0 ≤ c ≤ 1 is the curvature of the social utility
function.

In this paper, we are interested in exploring bounds when
there is some notion of “grouping” among users. Along these
lines, we consider two notions of grouping that yield to
provable performance bounds. The ﬁrst type of grouping we
consider is the recent framework of Chen et al. [8], where
associated with each user is a private objective function and
a ﬁxed group of users having some social ties with it. Each
user’s strategy maximizes an objective function called the
social group utility, which is the sum of its private objective
function and a linear combination of the private objective
functions of users in its group. Within this setting, Chen
et al. [8] deﬁne what they call a social-aware Nash equi-
librium, where no user can improve its social group utility
by unilaterally changing its strategy. We will show that this
framework yields to the bounding results of Vetta [13] for
noncoperative games, thus establishing provable performance
guarantees for the framework of [8].

In the second type of grouping we consider, the set of
users is partitioned into disjoint groups. Associated with
each group is a group utility function. Users within a group
cooperate in the sense that
their strategy is to (jointly)
maximize the group utility function, giving rise to a natural
deﬁnition of group Nash equilibrium. This case does not
yield to the results of [13]. Nonetheless, we show that for this

case a similar bound holds. Moreover, we deﬁne a measure
of curvature and derive an associated lower bound involving
this curvature. This bound is tighter than that for the case
where there is no grouping among users, accounting for the
cooperation within the groups.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we introduce our notation and some deﬁnitions
that will be used throughout the paper. In Section III, we
review the bounding results of [13]. we ﬁrst describe the
framework of [8] and show that, given submodularity and
validity, any social-aware Nash equilibrium achieves at least
1/2 of the optimal social utility, subject
to a function-
dependent additive term. We further prove that if the social
utility function is nondecreasing and submodular, then any
social-aware Nash equilibrium achieves at least 1/(1 + c)
of the optimal social utility, where c is the curvature of
the social utility function. Next, we describe our second
type of grouping involving l disjoint groups with in-group
cooperation. We show that, given submodularity and validity,
any group Nash equilibrium achieves at least 1/2 of the
optimal social utility, subject to a function-dependent addi-
tive term. We then deﬁne the curvature cki associated with
group i with ki users, and we show that if the social utility
function is nondecreasing and submodular, then any group
Nash equilibrium achieves at least 1/(1 + max1≤i≤l cki )
of the optimal social utility. In Section IV, we present an
example of a utility system for database assisted spectrum
access, adopted from [8]. We show that the utility system
for this example is valid and the social utility function is
submodular, illustrating an application of our results.

II. PRELIMINARIES

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce notation and a number

of deﬁnitions used throughout the paper.

A. Actions

Suppose we have a set N = {1, 2, . . . , N } of N users
and ground sets V1, V2, . . . , VN , where each element in Vi
denotes an act that user i can take. We call a set of acts an
action, and if an action xi ⊆ Vi is available to user i we call
it a feasible action. We denote by Xi the set of all feasible
actions for user i, i.e., Xi = {xi ⊆ Vi : xi is a feasible
action}, with ni = |Xi| the cardinality of Xi.

Let X = QN

i=1 Xi and X = (xi1 , . . . , xik ), where xj ∈
Xj, with i1 ≤ j ≤ ik. We call X an action sequence of
length k in X . This sequence includes the actions taken
by users i1, . . . , ik in order. Given an action sequence X,
suppose Y is formed by removing some of the elements of
X without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Then, we call the derived action sequence Y a subsequence
of X and denote this relation by Y ⊆ X. This follows the
deﬁnition of a subsequence in [14].

Consider an action sequence X = (x1, . . . , xN ) ∈ X .
Then, X−i = (x1, . . . , xi−1, xi+1, . . . , xN ) is the subse-
quence of X that includes actions taken by all users except
user i. We use (X−i, x′
i) to denote the action sequence

(x1, . . . , xi−1, x′
user i changes its action from xi to x′
i.

i, xi+1, . . . , xN ) that results from X when

Given action sequences Y = (yi1 , . . . , yik ) and Z =
(zj1 , . . . , zjl), we deﬁne Y ⊕ Z = (yi1 , . . . , yik , zj1 , . . . , zjl )
as the concatenation of Y and Z when ip 6= jq for 1 ≤ p ≤ k
and 1 ≤ q ≤ l (following the notation in [15]).

B. Strategies

Let si = (s1

i ≥ 0 is the probability
i = 1. Following
the terminology of [13], we call si a strategy taken by user
i. When sj
i = 0 for 1 ≤ j ≤ ni and l 6= j, we
say that user i takes a pure strategy. Otherwise, we say that
user i takes a mixed strategy.

i=1 Si. Similar to the
deﬁnition of an action sequence, we call S = (si1 , . . . , sik ),
with sj ∈ Sj and i1 ≤ j ≤ ik, a strategy sequence of length
k in S. Then a subsequence T of S is a sequence derived
from S by deleting some elements without changing the or-
der of the remaining elements. We deﬁne Si = (s1, . . . , si),
for 1 ≤ i ≤ N , as a sequence of strategies taken by users
1, . . . , i.

Given a strategy sequence S = (s1, . . . , sN ) ∈ S, the
sequence S−i = (s1, . . . , si−1, si+1, . . . , sN ) is the subse-
quence of S that contains strategies taken by all users except
user i, and (S−i, s′
i, si+1, . . . , sN ) is the
strategy sequence that results from S when user i changes
its strategy from si to s′
i.

and W when ip 6= jq for 1 ≤ p ≤ k and 1 ≤ q ≤ l.

C. Utility Functions

We deﬁne the social utility function as a mapping γ from
sequences in X to real numbers, and the private utility
function for user i (1 ≤ i ≤ N ) as a mapping αi from
sequences in X to real numbers. Correspondingly, we deﬁne
¯γ and ¯αi as mappings, from sequences in S to real numbers,
that correspond to the expectations of γ and αi, respectively.
We call ¯γ the expected social utility function and ¯αi the
expected private utility function for user i. We also deﬁne
γZ(Y ) = γ(Y ⊕ Z) − γ(Y ) for any Y, Z in X such that
Y ⊕ Z is well deﬁned, and ¯γW (T ) = ¯γ(T ⊕ W ) − ¯γ(T ) for
any T, W in S such that T ⊕ W is deﬁned.

We denote by Ω the optimal sequence of strategies in
maximizing an expected utility function ¯γ, and assume that
Ω = (σ1, . . . , σN ) is composed of pure strategies σi ∈ Si,
i = 1, . . . , N . For convenience, we also use σi to denote
the optimal action that user i takes. Then, we have that the
optimal value of ¯γ, denoted by OPT, is OPT= ¯γ(Ω) = γ(Ω).

D. Curvature, Monotoneity, and Submodularity

Given a strategy sequence Si = (s1, . . . , si) for 1 ≤ i ≤
N , we use the notation Ω ∪ Si to represent the sequence
in which user j (1 ≤ j ≤ i) implements the actions σj ∪

j with probabilities s1

j , . . . , σj ∪ xnj
j , and user j
x1
(j > i) plays the action σj, so ¯γ(Ω ∪ Si) is well deﬁned.
Then the curvature c of the expected social utility function
¯γ is deﬁned as

j , . . . , snj

c =

max

i:¯γsi (Si−1)>0(cid:26)1 −

¯γsi (Ω ∪ Si−1)

¯γsi (Si−1) (cid:27) .

The social utility function γ is called nondecreasing if for
all subsequences Y of a sequence X in X , i.e., Y ⊆ X in
X , f (Y ) ≤ f (X). It is called submodular if for all Y ⊆ X
and Z in X such that X ⊕ Z is deﬁned, we have γZ(Y ) ≥
γZ(X). Our terminology here is consistent with that of [14].
Because ¯γ is the expected value of γ, we have that if γ is
nondecreasing and submodular, then ¯γ is also nondecreasing
and submodular, respectively. So in the following sections,
when we say that γ is nondecreasing and submodular, it
implies that ¯γ is nondecreasing and submodular, respectively.

III. PERFORMANCE BOUNDS FOR NASH EQUILIBRIA

In this section, we ﬁrst review the deﬁnitions of a Nash
equilibrium and a valid utility system from [13]. We then
review the bounds derived in [13] for the performance of
any Nash equilibrium.

Deﬁnition 1: A strategy sequence S ∈ S is a Nash
equilibrium if no user has an incentive to unilaterally change
its strategy, i.e., for any user i,

¯αi(S) ≥ ¯αi((S−i, s′

i)),

∀s′

i ∈ Si.

(1)

Assumption 1: [13] The private utility of user i (1 ≤ i ≤
N ) is at least as large as the loss in the social utility resulting
from user i dropping out of the game. That is, the system
(¯γ, { ¯αi}N
i=1) has the property that for any strategy sequence
S = (s1, . . . , sN ) ∈ S,

¯αi(S) ≥ ¯γsi (S−i),

∀1 ≤ i ≤ N.

(2)

Assumption 2: [13] The sum of the private utilities of
the system is not larger than the social utility, i.e., for any
strategy sequence S = (s1, . . . , sN ) ∈ S,

N

¯αi(S) ≤ ¯γ(S).

(3)

A utility system (γ, {αi}N

i=1) satisfying Assumptions 1
and 2 is called a valid system. Given X ∈ X , if for any
the inequalities αi(X) ≥ γxi(X−i) and
1 ≤ i ≤ N ,
i=1 αi(X) ≤ γ(X) hold, then the inequalities (2) and (3)

IV. NASH EQUILIBRIA BASED ON USER GROUPS

A. Social-Aware Nash Equilibria

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce the social group utility
maximization system and the social-aware Nash equilibrium
deﬁned in [8]. Then, we show that
the results of [13]
are directly applicable to bounding the performance of any
social-aware Nash equilibrium.

In [8], each user belongs to a group and aims to maximize
its social group utility instead of its private utility. Each
group is formed based on social ties between users and
may reﬂect friendship, kinship, college relationship, etc. The
social group utility for user i (a mapping from X to real
numbers) is deﬁned as

ηi = αi + Xm∈N s

i

ωimαm

is the set of all users
where αi’s are private utilities, N s
i
having a social
tie with user i, and wim’s are weight
parameters that reﬂect the strengths of social ties between
user i and the users in N s
i . Correspondingly, the expected
group utility ¯ηi for user i, mapping from sequences in S to
real numbers, is the expected value of ηi.

Deﬁnition 2: [8] A strategy sequence S = (s1, . . . , sN ) ∈
S is a social-aware Nash equilibrium if no user can improve
its group utility by unilaterally changing its strategy, i.e., for
any group i,

¯ηi(S) ≥ ¯ηi((S−i, s′

i)),

∀s′

i ∈ Si.

(6)

By comparing the deﬁnition of a Nash equilibrium and a
social-aware Nash equilibrium, we see that the only differ-
ence between them is that one is deﬁned based on expected
private utility functions and the other based on expected
group utility functions. But because in [8], each user has its
own group utility function, and therefore its own expected
group utility function, then the results of [13] (in particular
Theorem 1 and Theorem 2) directly apply to bound the
performance of the social-aware Nash equilibrium of [8].
We prove in Theorem 3 and Theorem 4 that this is in fact
the case, if the social group utility system (γ, {ηi}N
i=1) is
valid. A social group utility system (γ, {ηi}N
i=1) is valid if it
satisﬁes the following assumptions, which are counterparts
of Assumption 1 and Assumption 2 with expected group
utilities standing in for expected private utilities.

Assumption 3: The group utility of user i (1 ≤ i ≤ N )
is at least as large as the loss in the social utility resulting
from user i dropping out of the game. That is, the system

Xi=1
ηi(X) ≥ γxi (X−i) and PN

inequalities (7) and (8) hold.

Given X ∈ X , if for any 1 ≤ i ≤ N , the inequalities
i=1 ηi(X) ≤ γ(X) hold, then the

i=1) has the property that for any strategy sequence

(γ, {ηi}N
S = (s1, . . . , sN ) ∈ S,

¯ηi(S) ≥ ¯γsi (S−i),

∀1 ≤ i ≤ N.

Assumption 4: The sum of the group utilities of the sys-
tem is not larger than the social utility, i.e., for any strategy
sequence S = (s1, . . . , sN ) ∈ S,

¯ηi(S) ≤ ¯γ(S).

B. Group Nash Equilibria

In this section we consider a different type of social group
utility maximization system in which the set of all users are
divided into disjoint groups, and the users in the same group
choose their strategies by maximizing their group utility
function jointly.

the number of users in group j, andPl

Assume that the set of users N = {1, . . . , N } is divided
into l disjoint groups, in which group i (1 ≤ i ≤ l) has
j=1 kj, kj is
j=1 kj = N . Let si =
(smi+1, . . . , smi+ki ), where si ∈ Si is the strategy for user
i. We call si the group strategy for group i. It includes the
strategies taken by all the users in group i (1 ≤ i ≤ l). We use
S−i to denote the sequence of group strategies taken by all
groups except for group i. Given S−i, we denote by (S−i, ti)
the group strategy sequence obtained when group i changes
its group strategy from si to ti. Similarly, for X ∈ X , we
use xi and X −i to denote the sequence of actions taken by
the users in group i, and the sequence of actions taken by
all groups except for group i, respectively. For convenience,
we still use ηi and ¯ηi to denote the group utility function
and the expected group utility function for group i.
We deﬁne a group Nash equilibrium as follows.
Deﬁnition 3: A strategy set S = (s1, . . . , sN ) is a group
Nash equilibrium of a utility system if no group can improve
its group utility by unilaterally changing its group strategy,
i.e., for any 1 ≤ i ≤ l,

¯ηi(S) ≥ ¯ηi((S−i, ti)),

∀ti = (tmi+1, . . . , tmi+ki),

where tj ∈ Sj for mi + 1 ≤ j ≤ mi + ki.

We say that the utility system (γ, {ηi}N

i=1) is valid if it

satisﬁes the following two assumptions.

Assumption 5: The group utility of group i is at least as
large as the loss in the social utility resulting from all the
users in group i dropping out of the game. That is, the system
i=1) has the property that for any strategy sequence
(γ, {ηi}N
S = (s1, . . . , sN ) ∈ S,

¯ηi(S) ≥ ¯γsi (S−i),

∀1 ≤ i ≤ N.

Assumption 6: The sum of the group utilities of the sys-
tem is not larger than the social utility, i.e., for any strategy
sequence S = (s1, . . . , sN ) ∈ S,

ηi(X) ≥ γxi (X −i) and Pl

Given X ∈ X , if for any 1 ≤ i ≤ l, the inequalities
i=1 ηi(X) ≤ γ(X) hold, then the
inequalities (11) and (12) hold. We now present our results
on the performance of a group Nash equilibrium relative to
the optimal social strategy Ω.

(12)

Lemma 1: Assume that the social utility function γ is a

submodular set function. Then for any strategy set S ∈ S,

¯γ(Ω) ≤ ¯γ(S)+ Xi:σi⊆Ω\S

¯γσi (S−i)− Xi:si⊆S\Ω

where S(i) = s1 ⊕ s2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ si is the sequence of the group
strategies taken by the ﬁrst i groups.

Proof: Write Ω = σ1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ σl and S =
s1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ sl, where σi = (σmi+1, . . . , σmi+ki ), si =
(smi+1, . . . , smi+ki ), and σj, sj ∈ Sj for mi + 1 ≤ j ≤
mi + ki.

By Propositions 1 and 2 in [16], we have that

Combining the two inequalities above, we have (13).

Theorem 5: For a valid utility system (γ, {ηi}N

¯γsi(S−i) ≤ Xi:si⊆S\Ω

Proof: For any group Nash equilibrium S ∈ S, write
S = s1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ sl, where si = (sm+1, . . . , sm+ki) for 1 ≤
i ≤ l.

By the deﬁnition of the curvature cki for group i, we have

¯γsi(Ω ∪ S−i) ≥ (1 − cki (¯γ)) ¯γsi (∅).

Using the inequality above and Lemma 2, we have

¯ηi(S)

¯γsi (S−i).

equilibrium is at least half of the optimal social utility
value.

To better characterize the relation of the social utility
value of any group Nash equilibrium and that of the optimal
solution Ω, we deﬁne the curvature cki of the social utility
function for group i as

Remarks

• When the group utility function γ is non-decreasing and
submodular, it is easy to check that cki ∈ [0, 1], which
implies that 1/(1 + max1≤i≤l cki (¯γ)) ≥ 1/2.

• Following the arguments in [16], we have that ck ≤ ck1
if k ≥ k1, and therefore 1/(1 + ck∗ ) ≥ 1/(1 + c1).
This shows that the bound for the case with grouping
is tighter than that for the case without grouping. Of
course, this is unsurprising, because grouping entails
cooperation. Moreover, the larger the value of k∗, the
higher the degree of cooperation, and the tighter the
lower bound.

V. EXAMPLE

In this section, we consider the application of utility-based
maximization in database assisted spectrum access, adopted
from [8]. We will show that the utility system is valid and
the social utility function is submodular. We then apply the
performance bounds for Nash, social-aware Nash, and group
Nash equilibria.

Consider a set of users N = {1, . . . , N } and a set of
TV channels M = {1, . . . , M }. The users in N wish to
access the TV channels in M, for purposes other than TV
transmissions, in a way that does not unnecessarily disrupt
the primary use of these channels, which is for TV transmis-
sion. Speciﬁcally, to protect the primary TV users, each user
i sends a spectrum access request message containing its geo-
location information to a geo-location database. In response,

the database sends back the set of vacant channels Mi ∈ M
and the allowable transmission power level Pi. Then each
user i chooses a feasible channel ai from the vacant channel
set Mi for data transmission. When multiple users choose
to access the same vacant channel,
interfere
with each other, depending on their relative distance: If the
distance between users m and i is dmi, interference occurs
only if dmi ≤ δ, where δ is a given threshold. The aim
is to minimize the total interference which is the sum of
interference received by each user.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we considered two types of grouping among
users in utility systems. The ﬁrst type of grouping is from
Chen et al. [8], where each user belongs to a group of
users having social
ties with it. For this type of utility
system, each user takes its strategy by maximizing its social
group utility function, giving rise to the notion of social-
aware Nash equilibrium. We proved that, for a valid utility
system, if the social utility function is submodular, then
any social-aware Nash equilibrium achieves at least 1/2 of
the optimal social utility, subject to a function-dependent
additive term. We further proved that if the social utility
function is nondecreasing and submodular, then any social-
aware Nash equilibrium achieves at least 1/(1 + c) times
the optimal social utility, where c is the curvature of the
social utility function. For the second type of grouping we
consider, the set of users is partitioned into l disjoint groups,
where the users within a group takes their group strategy
by maximizing their group utility, giving rise to the notion
of the group Nash equilibrium. We proved that, for a valid
utility system, if the social utility function is submodular,
then any group Nash equilibrium achieves at least 1/2 of
the optimal social utility, subject to a function-dependent
additive term. By deﬁning the curvature cki associated with
group i with ki users, we showed that if the social utility
function is nondecreasing and submodular, then any group
Nash equilibrium achieves at least 1/(1 + max1≤i≤l cki ) of
the optimal social utility. Finally, we presented an example
of a utility system for database assisted spectrum access to
illustrate our results.
