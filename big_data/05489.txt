Introduction

The approximation property was introduced by Grothendieck [14]. Enﬂo [12] gave the ﬁrst example of a
Banach space without the approximation property. Enﬂo’s counterexample is an artiﬁcially constructed Banach
space. The ﬁrst naturally deﬁned Banach space without the approximation property was given by Szankowski
[25], who proved that the space L(ℓ2; ℓ2) of continuous linear operators on ℓ2 does not have the approximation
property. Later Godefroy and Saphar [13] proved that, if LK(ℓ2; ℓ2) denotes the subspace of all compact members
of L(ℓ2; ℓ2), then the quotient L(ℓ2; ℓ2)/LK (ℓ2; ℓ2) does not have the approximation property.

Recently Dineen and Mujica [11] proved that if 1 < p ≤ q < ∞, then L(ℓp; ℓq) does not have the approxima-
tion property. They also proved that if 1 < p < ∞ and n ≥ p, then the space P(nℓp) of continuous n-homogeneous
polynomials on ℓp does not have the approximation property.

In this paper, by reﬁnements of the methods of Dineen and Mujica [11] and Godefroy and Shapar [13], we
present many examples of Banach spaces of linear operators and homogeneous polynomials which do not have the
approximation property.

In Section 2 we present some examples of Banach spaces of linear operators without the approximation prop-
erty. Among other results, we show that if 1 < p ≤ q < ∞, and E and F are closed inﬁnite dimensional subspaces
of ℓp and ℓq, respectively, then L(E; F ) does not have the approximation property. This improves a result of Dineen
and Mujica [11]. We also show that if 1 < p ≤ q < ∞, and E and F are closed inﬁnite dimensional subspaces
of ℓp and ℓq, respectively, then the quotient L(E; F )/LK (E; F ) does not have the approximation property. This
improves a result of Godefroy and Saphar [13].

In Section 3 we present more examples of Banach spaces of linear operators without the approximation prop-
erty. Our examples are Banach spaces of linear operators on Pelczynski’s universal space U1, on Orlicz sequence
spaces ℓMp, and on Lorentz sequence spaces d(w, p).

In Section 4 we present examples of Banach spaces of homogeneous polynomials without the approximation
property. Among other results we show that if 1 < p < ∞ and E is a closed inﬁnite dimensional subspace of ℓp,

then P(nE) does not have the approximation property for every n ≥ p. This improves another result of Dineen
and Mujica [11]. We also show that if 1 < p ≤ q < ∞, and E and F are closed inﬁnite dimensional subspaces of
ℓp and ℓq, respectively, then P(nE; F ) does not have the approximation property for every n ≥ 1. We also show
that if n < p ≤ q < ∞, and E and F are closed inﬁnite dimensional subspaces of ℓp and ℓq, respectively, then the
quotient P(nE; F )/PK (nE; F ) does not have the approximation property.

research has been supported by CAPES and CNPq.

2 Banach spaces of linear operators without the approximation property

Let E and F denote Banach spaces over K, where K is R or C. Let E ′ denote the dual of E. Let L(E; F )

(resp. LK(E; F )) denote the space of all bounded (resp. compact) linear operators from E into F .

Let us recall that E is said to have the approximation property if given K ⊂ E compact and ǫ > 0, there is a
ﬁnite rank operator T ∈ L(E; E) such that kT x − xk < ǫ for every x ∈ K. If E has the approximation property,
then every complemented subspace of E also has the approximation property. E is said to have the bounded
approximation property if there exists λ ≥ 1 so that for every compact subset K ⊂ E and for every ǫ > 0 there is
a ﬁnite rank operator T ∈ L(E; E) such that kT k ≤ λ and kT x − xk < ǫ for every x ∈ K. E is isomorphic to a
complemented subspace of F if and only if there are A ∈ L(E; F ) and B ∈ L(F ; E) such that B ◦ A = I. These
simple remarks will be repeatedly used throughout this paper.

Theorem 2.1. Let E and F be Banach spaces. If E and F contain complemented subspaces isomorphic to M and
N , respectively, then L(E; F ) contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to L(M ; N ).

Proof. By hypothesis there are A1 ∈ L(M ; E), B1 ∈ L(E; M ), A2 ∈ L(N ; F ), B2 ∈ L(F ; N ) such that
B1 ◦ A1 = I and B2 ◦ A2 = I. Consider the operators

and

C : S ∈ L(M ; N ) → A2 ◦ S ◦ B1 ∈ L(E; F )

D : T ∈ L(E; F ) → B2 ◦ T ◦ A1 ∈ L(M ; N ).

Then D ◦ C = I and the desired conclusion follows.

The next theorem improves [11, Proposition 2.4].

Theorem 2.2. Let 1 < p ≤ q < ∞. If E and F contain complemented subspaces isomorphic to ℓp and ℓq,
respectively, then L(E; F ) does not have the approximation property.

Proof. By Theorem 2.1 L(E; F ) contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to L(ℓp; ℓq). Then the conclusion
follows from [11, Proposition 2.2 ].

The next result improves [11, Proposition 2.2].

Theorem 2.3. Let 1 < p ≤ q < ∞, and let E and F be closed inﬁnite dimensional subspaces of ℓp and ℓq,
respectively. Then L(E; F ) does not have the approximation property.

Proof. By [21, Lemma 2 ] or [16, Proposition 2.a.2] E and F contain complemented subspaces isomorphic to ℓp
and ℓq, respectively. Then the desired conclusion follows from Theorem 2.2.

2

The next result complements [11, Proposition 2.1].

Theorem 2.4. Let 2 < p ≤ q < ∞, and let E and F be closed inﬁnite dimensional subspaces of Lp[0, 1] and
Lq[0, 1], respectively, with F not isomorphic to ℓ2. Then L(E; F ) does not have the approximation property.

Proof.

(i) If E is not isomorphic to ℓ2, then it follows from [22, p. 206, 12.5] that E and F contain comple-
mented subspaces isomorphic to ℓp and ℓq, respectively. Then the desired conclusion follows from Theorem
2.2.

(ii) If E is isomorphic to ℓ2, then the same argument shows that L(E; F ) contains a complemented subspace

isomorphic to L(ℓ2; ℓq), and the desired conclusion follows as before.

The next result improves [13, Corollary 2.8].

Theorem 2.5. If 1 < p ≤ q < ∞, then L(ℓp; ℓq)/LK (ℓp; ℓq) does not have the approximation property.

Proof. We apply [13, Theorem 2.4]. By [15, Lemma 1] LK(ℓp; ℓq)⊥ is a complemented subspace of L(ℓp; ℓq)′.
By [18, Corollary 16.69] LK(ℓp; ℓq) has a Schauder basis. If we assume that L(ℓp; ℓq)/LK(ℓp; ℓq) has the ap-
proximation property, then [13, Theorem 2.4] would imply that L(ℓp; ℓq) has the approximation property, thus
contradicting [11, Proposition 2.2].

Remark 2.6. If 1 < q < p < ∞, then L(ℓp; ℓq) = LK(ℓp; ℓq), by a result of Pitt [23]. Hence the restriction p ≤ q
in the preceding theorem cannot be deleted.

Theorem 2.7. If E and F contain complemented subspaces isomorphic to M and N , respectively, then L(E; F )/LK (E; F )
contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to L(M ; N )/LK (M ; N ).

Proof. By hypothesis there are A1 ∈ L(M ; E), B1 ∈ L(E; M ), A2 ∈ L(N ; F ), B2 ∈ L(F ; N ) such that
B1 ◦ A1 = I and B2 ◦ A2 = I. Let C : L(M ; N ) → L(E; F ) and D : L(E; F ) → L(M ; N ) be the operators from
the proof of Theorem 2.1. Since C(LK(M ; N )) ⊂ LK(E; F ) and D(LK (E; F )) ⊂ LK(M ; N ), the operators

˜C : [S] ∈ L(M ; N )/LK (M ; N ) → [A2 ◦ S ◦ B1] ∈ L(E; F )/LK (E; F )

and

˜D : [T ] ∈ L(E; F )/LK (E; F ) → [B2 ◦ T ◦ A1] ∈ L(M ; N )/LK (M ; N )

are well deﬁned, and ˜D ◦ ˜C = I, thus completing the proof.

Theorem 2.8. Let 1 < p ≤ q < ∞. If E and F contain complemented subspaces isomorphic to ℓp and ℓq,
respectively, then L(E; F )/LK (E; F ) does not have the approximation property.

Proof. By Theorem 2.7 L(E; F )/LK (E; F ) contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to L(ℓp; ℓq)/LK (ℓp; ℓq).
Then the desired conclusion follows from Theorem 2.5.

By combining Theorem 2.8 and [21, Lemma 2] we obtain the following theorem.

Theorem 2.9. Let 1 < p ≤ q < ∞, and let E and F be closed inﬁnite dimensional subspaces of ℓp and ℓq,
respectively. Then L(E; F )/LK (E; F ) does not have the approximation property.

3 Other examples of Banach spaces of linear operators without the approxima-

tion property

Example 3.1. Let U1 denote the universal space of Pelczynski (see, [16, Theorem 2.d.10]). U1 is a Banach space
with an unconditional basis with the property that every Banach space with an unconditional basis is isomorphic
to a complemented subspace of U1. Since every ℓp (1 ≤ p < ∞) has an unconditional basis, it follows that every
ℓp (1 ≤ p < ∞) is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of U1. By Theorem 2.2 none of the spaces L(U1; U1),
L(U1; ℓq) (1 < q < ∞) or L(ℓp; U1) (1 < p < ∞) have the approximation property.
Deﬁnition 3.2. (see [16, p. 137])

An Orlicz function M is a continuous convex nondecreasing function M : [0, ∞) → R such that M (0) = 0 and
M (t) = ∞. Let

lim
t→∞

ℓM = (cid:26)x = (ξn)∞
Then ℓM is a Banach space for the norm

n=1 ⊂ K :

∞

Xn=1

M (|ξn/ρ) < ∞ f or some ρ > 0(cid:27).

kxk = inf (cid:26)ρ > 0;

∞

Xn=1

M (|ξn/ρ) ≤ 1(cid:27).

ℓM is called an Orlicz sequence space.
Example 3.3. Consider the Orlicz function Mp(t) = tp(1 + | log t|), with 1 < p < ∞. Then the Orlicz sequence
space ℓMp contains complemented subspaces isomorphic to ℓp (see [16, p. 157]). If 1 < p ≤ q < ∞, then by
Theorem 2.2, L(ℓMp; ℓMq ) does not have the approximation property.
Deﬁnition 3.4. (see [16, p. 175])

Let 1 ≤ p < ∞ and let w = {wn}∞

n=1 be a nonincreasing sequence of positive numbers such that w1 = 1,

∞

lim
n→∞

wn = 0 and

wn = ∞. Let

Xn=1
d(w, p) = (cid:26)x = (ξn)∞

n=1 ⊂ K : kxk = sup

π (cid:18)

∞

Xn=1

|ξπ(n)|pwn(cid:19)1/p

< ∞(cid:27),

where π ranges over all permutations of N. Then d(w, p) is a Banach space, called a Lorentz sequence space.

Example 3.5. It follows from [16, p. 177, Proposition 4.e.3] that every closed inﬁnite dimensional subspace of
d(w, p) contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to ℓp. By Theorem 2.2, if 1 < p ≤ q < ∞, and E and
F are closed inﬁnite dimensional subspaces of d(w, p) and d(w, q), respectively, then L(E; F ) does not have the
approximation property.

4 Spaces of homogeneous polynomials without the approximation property

Let P(nE; F ) denote the Banach space of all continuous n-homogeneous polynomials from E into F . We omit
F when F = K. A polynomial P ∈ P(nE; F ) is called compact if P takes bounded subsets in E into relatively
compact subsets in F . Let PK (nE; F ) denote the space of all compact n-homogeneous polynomials from E into
F . We refer to [7] or [19] for background information on the theory of polynomials on Banach spaces.

An important tool in this section is a linearization theorem due to Ryan [24]. We will use the following version

of Ryan’s linearization theorem, wich appeared in [20]. Here τc denotes the compact-open topology.

4

Theorem 4.1. For each Banach space E and each n ∈ N let

with the norm induced by P(nE), and let

Q(nE) = (P(nE), τc)′,

δn : x ∈ E → δx ∈ Q(nE)

denote the evaluation mapping, that is, δx(P ) = P (x) for every x ∈ E and P ∈ P(nE). Then Q(nE) is a Banach
space and δn ∈ P(nE; Q(nE)). The pair (Q(nE), δn) has the following universal property: for each Banach
space F and each P ∈ P(nE; F ), there is a unique operator Tp ∈ L(Q(nE); F ) such that Tp ◦ δn = P . The
mapping

P ∈ P(nE; F ) → Tp ∈ L(Q(nE); F )

is an isometric isomorphism. Moreover P ∈ PK(nE; F ) if only if Tp ∈ LK(Q(nE); F ). Furthermore Q(nE) is
isometrically isomorphic to ˆ⊗n,s,πE, the completion of the space of n-symmetric tensors on E, with the projective
topology.

Theorem 4.2. If E and F contain complemented subspaces isomorphic to M and N , respectively, then P(nE; F )
contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to P(nM ; N ).

Proof. By hypothesis there are A1 ∈ L(M ; E), B1 ∈ L(E; M ), A2 ∈ L(N ; F ), B2 ∈ L(F ; N ) such that
B1 ◦ A1 = I and B2 ◦ A2 = I. Consider the operators

and

C : P ∈ P(nM ; N ) → A2 ◦ P ◦ B1 ∈ P(nE; F )

D : Q ∈ P(nE; F ) → B2 ◦ Q ◦ A1 ∈ P(nM ; N ).

Then D ◦ C = I and the desired conclusion follows.

Corollary 4.3. If E contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to M, then P(nE) contains a complemented
subspace isomorphic to P(nM ).

Proof. Take F = N = K in Theorem 4.2.

The next theorem improves [11, Theorem 3.2].

Theorem 4.4. Let 1 < p < ∞. If E contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to ℓp, then P(nE) does not
have the approximation property for every n ≥ p.

Proof. By Corollary 4.3 P(nE) contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to P(nℓp). Then the conclusion
follows from [11, Theorem 3.2].

Theorem 4.4 can be used to produce many additional counterexamples. For instance, by combining Theorem

4.4 and [21, Lemma 2] we obtain the following result.

Theorem 4.5. Let 1 < p < ∞ and let E be a closed inﬁnite dimensional subspace of ℓp. Then P(nE) does not
have the approximation property for every n ≥ p.

In a similar way we may obtain scalar-valued polynomial versions of Theorem 2.4 and Examples 3.1, 3.3 and

3.5. We leave the details to the reader.

Theorem 4.6. Let 1 < p ≤ q < ∞. If E and F contain complemented subspaces isomorphic to ℓp and ℓq,
respectively, then P(nE; F ) does not have the approximation property for every n ≥ 1.

Proof. By [4, Proposition 5], L(E; F ) is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of P(nE; F ). Then the desired
conclusion follows from Theorem 2.2.

Theorem 4.6 can be used to produce many additional counterexamples. For instance, by combining Theorem

4.6 and [21, Lemma 2] we obtain the following result.

Theorem 4.7. Let 1 < p ≤ q < ∞. and let E and F be closed inﬁnite dimensional subspaces of ℓp and ℓq,
respectively. Then P(nE; F ) does not have the approximation property for every n ≥ 1.

In a similar way we may obtain vector-valued polynomial versions of Theorem 2.4 and Examples 3.1, 3.3 and

3.5. We leave the details to the reader.

Theorem 4.8. If n < p ≤ q < ∞. Then P(nℓp; ℓq)/PK (nℓp; ℓq) does not have the approximation property.

Proof. By Theorem 4.1 we can write

and

P(nℓp; ℓq) = L(Q(nℓp); ℓq)

PK(nℓp; ℓq) = LK(Q(nℓp); ℓq).

We apply [13, Theorem 2.4]. By [15, Lemma 1] LK(Q(nℓp); ℓq)⊥ is a complemented subspace of L(Q(nℓp); ℓq)′.
By [11, Remark 3.3] P(nℓp) is a reﬂexive Banach space with a Schauder basis. Hence Q(nℓp) is also a reﬂexive
Banach space with a Schauder basis. Then by [18, Corollary 16.69] LK (Q(nℓp); ℓq) has a Schauder basis. If we
assume that L(Q(nℓp); ℓq)/LK(Q(nℓp); ℓq) has the approximation property, then [13, Theorem 2.4] would imply
that L(Q(nℓp); ℓq) has the approximation property. But this contradicts Theorem 2.8, since ℓp = Q(1ℓp) is a
complemented subspace of Q(nℓp), by [4, Theorem 3]. This completes the proof.

Theorem 4.9. If E and F contain complemented subspaces isomorphic to M and N , respectively, then P(nE; F )/PK (nE; F )
contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to P(nM ; N )/PK (nM ; N ).

Proof. By hypothesis there are A1 ∈ L(M ; E), B1 ∈ L(E; M ), A2 ∈ L(N ; F ), B2 ∈ L(F ; N ) such that
B1 ◦ A1 = I and B2 ◦ A2 = I. Let

and

C : P(nM ; N ) → P(nE; F )

D : P(nE; F ) → P(nM ; N )

be the operators from the proof of Theorem 4.2. Since C(PK (nM ; N )) ⊂ PK(nE; F ) and D(PK (nE; F )) ⊂
PK (nM ; N ), the operators

˜C : [P ] ∈ P(nM ; N )/PK (nM ; N ) → [A2 ◦ P ◦ B1] ∈ P(nE; F )/PK (nE; F )

and

˜D : [Q] ∈ P(nE; F )/PK (nE; F ) → [B2 ◦ Q ◦ A1] ∈ P(nM ; N )/PK (nM ; N )

are well-deﬁned and ˜D ◦ ˜C = I, thus completing the proof.

Theorem 4.10. Let n < p ≤ q < ∞. If E and F contain complemented subspaces isomorphic to ℓp and ℓq,
respectively, then P(nE; F )/PK (nE; F ) does not have the approximation property.

6

Proof. By Theorem 4.9 P(nE; F )/PK (nE; F ) contains a complemented subspace isomorphic to P(nℓp; ℓq)/PK (nℓp; ℓq).
Thus the desired conclusion follows from Theorem 4.8.

Theorem 4.10 can be used to produce many additional counterexamples. For instance by combining Theorem

4.10 and [21, Lemma 2] we obtain the following theorem.

Theorem 4.11. Let n < p ≤ q < ∞, and let E and F be closed inﬁnite dimensional subspaces of ℓp and ℓq,
respectively. Then P(nE; F )/PK (nE; F ) does not have the approximation property.

The interest in the study of the approximation property in spaces of homogeneous polynomials begun in 1976
with a paper of Aron and Schottenloher [3]. They begun the study of the approximation property on the space
H(E) of all holomorphic functions on E under various topologies. Among many other results they proved that
(H(E), τw) has the approximation property if and only if P(nE) has the approximation property for every n ∈ N.
Here τw denotes the compact-ported topology introduced by Nachbin. They also proved that P(nℓ1) has the
approximation property for every n ∈ N. Ryan [24] proved that P(nc0) has a Schauder basis, and in particular
has the approximation property, for every n ∈ N. Tsirelson [26] constructed a reﬂexive Banach space X, with
an unconditional Schauder basis, which contains no subspace isomorphic to any ℓp. By using a result of Alencar,
Aron and Dineen [2], Alencar [1] proved that P(nX) has a Schauder basis, and in particular has the approximation
property, for every n ∈ N. In a series of papers Dineen and Mujica [8] [9] [10] have extended some of the results
of Aron and Schottenloher [3] to spaces of holomorphic functions deﬁned on arbitrary open sets.
