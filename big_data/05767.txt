We develop a theory for realizing frequency-independent, reﬂectionless, single-layer metaﬁlms based on the
Brewster eﬀect. A metaﬁlm designed based on the theory is numerically analyzed using a ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-
domain method. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the reﬂectance of the metaﬁlm vanishes independent
of the frequency and that the metaﬁlm behaves like an all-pass ﬁlter (with ﬁnite loss). An analysis based on an
electrical circuit model of the reﬂectionless metaﬁlm reveals that the energy of the suppressed reﬂection wave
is not stored in the metaﬁlm but is radiated to the transmission direction.

In recent years there has been considerable interest
in controlling electromagnetic waves using metamate-
rials.
In particular, metaﬁlms that are composed of
two-dimensionally arranged meta-atoms have attracted
much attention, because they can be fabricated more
easily than three-dimensional metamaterials and enable
the realization of a wide variety of elements for con-
trolling electromagnetic waves. For example, metaﬁlms
have been applied to polarization control [1-5], harmonic
generation enhancement [6-9], and slow group velocity
propagation [10-13].
In these studies, metaﬁlms with
planar structures, which are usually referred to as meta-
surfaces, were used. Although metasurfaces are very
useful for controlling electromagnetic waves, arbitrary
optical properties cannot be obtained using single-layer
metasurfaces with negligible thicknesses. This is be-
cause only electric dipoles can be induced in the plane of
metasurfaces, which sets some restrictions on the optical
properties of single-layer metasurfaces. For example, the
absorbance cannot exceed 0.5 [14,15], and the amplitude
and phase of the transmitted (reﬂected) wave cannot be
controlled independently [16].

The above restrictions can be removed in multilayer
metasurfaces and metaﬁlms with ﬁnite thicknesses. Per-
fect absorption [17] and independent control of the re-
ﬂection amplitude and phase [18] have been realized us-
ing ground planes. In addition, control of the transmis-
sion phase with nearly unity amplitude [16, 19-23] and
ground-plane-less perfect absorbers [24, 25] have been

realized in metasurfaces (metaﬁlms) composed of more
than two-layer structures [16, 19, 20], Huygens’ meta-
surfaces [21-24], and omega metaﬁlms [25]. Although
suppression of the transmission/reﬂection is essential in
these examples, it is much more diﬃcult to suppress
the reﬂection independent of the frequency than the
transmission. Thus far, the frequency-independent sup-
pression of reﬂection in metasurfaces (metaﬁlms) has
been realized only in Huygens’ metasurfaces [23, 24] and
omega metaﬁlms [25], where the amplitudes of radiated
waves from the induced electric and magnetic dipoles are
designed to be equal over a broad frequency range.

In this study, we propose and numerically verify a
method for suppressing reﬂection independent of fre-
quency in single-layer metaﬁlms composed of meta-
atoms with only an electric response. The frequency-
independent reﬂectionless metaﬁlm is designed based on
the Brewster eﬀect in metaﬁlms [26] and the optical
properties of the designed metaﬁlm are numerically ana-
lyzed using a ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain method [27].
The reﬂectionless metaﬁlm is modeled as an electrical
circuit using the results of the numerical simulation, and
the mechanism of the electromagnetic response of the
metaﬁlm is clariﬁed using the electrical circuit model.

First, we brieﬂy review the Brewster eﬀect, the physi-
cal origin of which is the key of the present study. When
an electromagnetic wave with certain polarization is in-
cident on a planar interface between two distinct media
at a particular angle, called the Brewster angle, the wave
is transmitted with zero reﬂection [28]. The physical ori-
gin of the Brewster eﬀect can be understood by consider-
ing radiations from the electric and magnetic dipoles in-

duced in the media [29]. Here, an electromagnetic wave
is assumed to be incident from vacuum onto a purely di-
electric medium for simplicity. In this case, the reﬂected
wave consists of radiation from the electric dipoles in-
duced in the dielectric medium. Because these electric
dipoles cannot radiate electromagnetic waves in the di-
rection of the oscillation, the reﬂected wave vanishes if
the propagation direction of the reﬂected wave coincides
with the oscillation direction of the electric dipoles.

We develop a method for suppressing the reﬂection
from single-layer metaﬁlms independent of the incident
frequency based on the Brewster eﬀect. Let us assume
that the oscillation direction of the electric dipoles in
a metaﬁlm is in the y direction and that meta-atoms
are arranged at angle θ with respect to the x axis, as
shown in Fig. 1. (The system is assumed to be periodic
in the z direction.) The incident and reﬂection angles
are denoted by φ. A geometric calculation shows that
the reﬂected wave propagates along the y direction when
θ = φ is satisﬁed. Thus, the reﬂected wave vanishes if
the arrangement of the meta-atoms and the propagation
direction of the incident wave are chosen such that θ = φ
is satisﬁed. The reﬂection can be suppressed as long as
the electric dipoles oscillate along the y direction; there-
fore, the suppression of the reﬂection can be achieved
independent of the incident frequency.

We design a frequency-independent, reﬂectionless,
single-layer metaﬁlm based on the above theory.
In
this study, an electric-ﬁeld-coupled inductive-capacitive
resonator (ELC) [30] shown in Fig. 2(a) is used as the
meta-atom. (Other structures with a purely dielectric
response can also be used as the meta-atom.) This struc-
ture is one of the commonly used meta-atoms and ex-
hibits a purely dielectric response for electromagnetic
waves that propagate along the x direction. When a y-
polarized electromagnetic wave is incident on the ELC,
an electric dipole is induced in the y direction. The fre-
quency dependence of the ELC response is Lorentz-type
with a resonance frequency that is determined by the

inductance of the ring and the capacitance of the cen-
tral gap. The metaﬁlm is constructed by periodically
arranging ELCs in the z direction and in the direction
of θ = φ = π/4, for which the interaction between the
incident wave and the metaﬁlm becomes strongest be-
cause the propagation direction of the incident wave co-
incides with the direction in which the radiation from
each electric dipole is largest. Such a structure can be
fabricated using microelectromechanical systems-based
technologies [31].

We numerically analyzed the transmission and reﬂec-
tion properties of the designed metaﬁlm using a ﬁnite-
diﬀerence time-domain method. Figure 2(b) shows the
simulation system. The dimension of the simulation
space was 6 mm × 6 mm × 75 µm. Periodic boundary
conditions were applied to the z direction and perfectly
matched layer boundary conditions were applied to the
x and y directions. The unit cell of the metaﬁlm, shown
in Fig. 2(a), was periodically arranged in the direction of
θ = π/4, and the number of the arranged ELCs was 56.
A y-polarized Gaussian beam with a focal spot width
of 1.2 mm and a Rayleigh range of 3.8 mm was incident
from the −x direction onto the metaﬁlm at the incident
angle of φ = π/4. The transmittance (reﬂectance) of the
metaﬁlm is calculated as the ratio of the amplitude of
the transmitted (reﬂected) wave to the amplitude of the
incident wave in the far-ﬁeld region.

Figure 3 shows the transmission and reﬂection spectra
of the metaﬁlm when the conductivity σ of the ELC is
equal to 1.0 × 107 S/m, 1.0 × 106 S/m, 2.0 × 105 S/m, and
5.0 × 104 S/m. To allow for a detailed discussion of the
electromagnetic response of the metaﬁlm in the following

and (d) 4. The values of Rnr/Rr in these four conditions are determined by assuming that Rnr for σ = 2.0 × 105 S/m is
equal to Rr. However, Rnr for σ = 2.0 × 105 S/m is not exactly equal to Rr; thus, the value of Rnr/Rr in condition (c) is
slightly shifted from 1 so that V ′
out/Vin well agrees with t. The other electrical circuit parameters used in this calculation are
L = β × 1.702 × 10−13 H, C = (1/β) × 1.702 × 10−13 F, and Rr = β × (1/17) Ω, where β (> 0) is a dimensionless constant and

paragraphs, the optical properties are calculated for sev-
eral values of σ. The reﬂectance vanishes independent
of the incident frequency in every case. Therefore, the
theory for realizing frequency-independent reﬂectionless
single-layer metaﬁlms is conﬁrmed, and hereafter, we fo-
cus on the transmission properties of the reﬂectionless
metaﬁlms. The amplitude transmittance is almost unity
independent of the frequency for σ = 1.0 × 107 S/m.
This observation can be understood from energy con-
servation. The absorption in the metaﬁlm is negli-
gible because the ELC is made of an almost perfect
electric conductor. Both the reﬂection and absorption
vanish in the metaﬁlm, resulting in perfect transmis-
sion. The transmittance at the resonance frequency,
0.935 THz, decreases as the conductivity decreases, and
it vanishes for σ = 2.0×105 S/m, which implies that per-
fect absorption takes place. The transmittance increases
with further decreasing the conductivity. The transmis-
sion phase monotonically increases with the incident fre-
quency and ranges from −π to π for σ > 2 × 105 S/m.
On the other hand, for σ < 2×105 S/m, the transmission
phase decreases with increasing the incident frequency at
around the resonance frequency and takes on a narrower
range of values compared with the case of large conduc-
tivity. Although the reﬂectionless metaﬁlm is composed
of a commonly used Lorentz-type meta-atom, the depen-
dence of the metaﬁlm transmittance on the frequency
and the loss in meta-atoms is quite diﬀerent from that

of usual Lorentz-type metamaterials.

Next, we create and analyze an electrical circuit model
of the frequency-independent reﬂectionless metaﬁlm to
understand its electromagnetic response mechanism.
Since the metaﬁlm behaves like an all-pass ﬁlter when
the ELC is made of a perfect electric conductor, we
consider the electrical circuit shown in Fig. 4, where
L, C, Rr, and Rnr represent the inductance of the
ring, capacitance at the central gap, radiation loss, and
non-radiation loss of the ELC, respectively. The volt-
age source Vin corresponds to the incident wave. Ap-
plying Kirchhoﬀ’s voltage law to the electrical circuit
yields Vout = −{[Rr − Rnr + iωL + (iωC)−1]/[Rr +
Rnr − iωL − (iωC)−1]}(Vin/2). In the case of Rnr = 0,

|Vout/Vin| = 1/2 is satisﬁed independent of the source
frequency and arg(Vout/Vin) ranges from −π to π. As-
suming that V ′
out = 2Vout is the output and Vin is the
input of the electrical circuit, the electrical circuit can
be regarded as an all-pass ﬁlter with unity gain. Fig-
ure 3 shows the frequency dependence of V ′
out/Vin for
four diﬀerent values of Rnr/Rr, which correspond to the
four conditions in the numerical simulation. The fre-
quency dependences of the absolute value and argument
of V ′
out/Vin agree well with the transmission properties of
the reﬂectionless metaﬁlm. Therefore, the electrical cir-
cuit shown in Fig. 4 can safely be regarded as a suitable
electrical circuit model of the reﬂectionless metaﬁlm. It
is important to notice that V ′
out = Vin − 2RrI is satisﬁed
in this electrical circuit. The mechanism of the electro-
magnetic response of the metaﬁlm can be understood
based on this equation.

To understand the meaning of the above equation, we
consider the electromagnetic response of the metaﬁlm
with θ = 90◦ (metasurface) for normal incidence.
In
this case, the amplitudes of the radiated waves from the
metasurface propagating in the transmission and reﬂec-
tion directions are the same. Although the conﬁgura-
tion of the electrical circuit model of the metasurface is
identical to that of the electrical circuit shown in Fig. 4,
the transmittance does not correspond to V ′
out/Vin in
this case. The amplitude of the transmitted wave cor-
responds to Vin − RrI. This is because the transmitted
wave is composed of a superposition of the incident wave
and the radiation from the metasurface, which is propor-
tional to the current I and the radiation loss Rr in the
meta-atom, and the transmittance of the Lorentz-type
metasurface at the resonance frequency vanishes in the
case of Rnr = 0 [4, 32]. Therefore, the amplitude of the
radiated wave from the metasurface propagating in the
transmission direction corresponds to RrI.

Now we discuss the meaning of the equation, V ′

out =
Vin − 2RrI. Based on the above analysis and equation,
the amplitude of the radiated wave from the reﬂection-
less metaﬁlm propagating in the transmission direction
is found to be twice as large as that of the radiated wave
from the metasurface propagating in the transmission di-
rection. This implies that the energy of the suppressed
reﬂection wave is not stored in the reﬂectionless metaﬁlm
but is radiated to the transmission direction.

For further understanding the physical mechanism of
the electromagnetic response, we consider the transmit-
tance of the metaﬁlm at the resonance frequency for two
special cases, Rnr = 0 and Rnr = Rr, using the result
of the above discussion. When Rnr = 0, the metaﬁlm
radiates an electromagnetic wave with two times larger
amplitude than and opposite phase to the incident wave.
This implies that the absolute value and argument of
the transmittance are unity and π, respectively. When
Rnr = Rr, the current I that ﬂows in the meta-atom
is equal to half of that in the case of Rnr = 0. Thus,
the metaﬁlm radiates an electromagnetic wave with the
same amplitude as and opposite phase to the incident

4

wave, and the transmittance vanishes. Here, the ra-
diated power from the metaﬁlm is equal to the ab-
sorbed power in the metaﬁlm because Rnr = Rr is satis-
ﬁed. (This condition is known as critical coupling [33].)
Therefore, perfect absorption occurs.

Note that the macroscopic optical property of the re-
ﬂectionless metaﬁlm is similar to that of a Huygens’
metasurface with spectrally overlapping electric and
magnetic resonances [34]. Although only electric dipoles
are induced in the reﬂectionless metaﬁlm, the suppres-
sion of the reﬂection causes the equivalent eﬀect for the
radiation from magnetic dipoles, which has the same
amplitude as that from the induced electric dipoles.

In conclusion, we developed a theory for realiz-
ing frequency-independent, reﬂectionless, single-layer
metaﬁlms and analyzed the optical properties of one
such metaﬁlm, which was designed based on the the-
ory. The frequency-independent suppression of the re-
ﬂection is realized by arranging the meta-atoms so that
the oscillation direction of the electric dipole induced in
the meta-atom coincides with the propagation direction
of the reﬂected wave. The designed metaﬁlm was nu-
merically analyzed using a ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain
method. The reﬂectance of the metaﬁlm was conﬁrmed
to vanish independent of the incident frequency and of
the loss in the meta-atom. An electrical circuit model
of the reﬂectionless metaﬁlm was created and the mech-
anism of the electromagnetic response of the metaﬁlm
was analyzed based on the model. The analysis revealed
that the energy of the suppressed reﬂection wave is not
stored in the metaﬁlm but is radiated to the transmis-
sion direction.

The frequency-independent reﬂectionless metaﬁlm be-
haves as an all-pass ﬁlter when the non-radiative loss
Rnr is much smaller than the radiation loss Rr. All-
pass ﬁlters are important elements for applications such
as signal processing [35, 36]. When Rnr = Rr is satis-
ﬁed, perfect absorption can be realized using the single-
layer metaﬁlm developed here. The suppression of the
reﬂection in our method is realized as long as the in-
duced electric dipole oscillates along the y direction.
Thus, transmission-type spatial phase modulators and
multiband perfect absorbers may be realized using our
method. The concept of suppressing reﬂection by con-
sidering the radiation pattern of meta-atoms and the
propagation direction of the reﬂected wave may yield
various useful devices for controlling electromagnetic
waves.
