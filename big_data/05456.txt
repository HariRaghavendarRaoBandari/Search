CRITICAL METRICS OF THE VOLUME FUNCTIONAL ON

COMPACT THREE-MANIFOLDS WITH SMOOTH BOUNDARY

R. BATISTA, R. DI ´OGENES, M. RANIERI, AND E. RIBEIRO JR

Abstract. We study the space of smooth Riemannian structures on com-

pact three-manifolds with boundary that satisﬁes a critical point equation

associated with a boundary value problem, for simplicity, Miao-Tam critical

metrics. We provide an estimate to the area of the boundary of Miao-Tam

critical metrics on compact three-manifolds. In addition, we obtain a B¨ochner

type formula which enables us to show that a Miao-Tam critical metric on a

compact three-manifold with positive scalar curvature must be isometric to a
geodesic ball in S3

.

1. Introduction

In the last decades very much attention has been given to characterizing critical

metrics of the Riemannian functionals, as for instance, the total scalar curvature

functional and the volume functional. Einstein and Hilbert proved that the critical

points of the total scalar curvature functional restricted to the set of smooth Rie-
mannian structures on M n of unitary volume are Einstein (cf. Theorem 4.21 in [4]).

It permits to prove the existence, on a given compact manifold, of many metrics

with constant scalar curvature. This stimulated many interesting works. For ex-

ample, Miao and Tam [17, 18], motivated also by a result obtained in [10], studied

variational properties of the volume functional constrained to the space of metrics

of constant scalar curvature on a given compact manifold with boundary. Some

results obtained in [17] suggest that critical metrics with a prescribed boundary

metric seem to be rather rigid.

Following the terminology used in [3] we recall the deﬁnition of Miao-tam critical

metrics.

Deﬁnition 1. A Miao-Tam critical metric is a 3-tuple (M n, g, f ), where (M n, g)

is a compact Riemannian manifold of dimension at least three with a smooth bound-
ary ∂M and f : M n → R is a smooth function such that f −1(0) = ∂M satisfying
the overdetermined-elliptic system

(1.1)

L∗

g(f ) = g.

g is the formal L2-adjoint of the linearization of the scalar curvature oper-

Here, L∗
ator Lg. Such a function f is called a potential function.

It is worthwhile to remark that

L∗
g(f ) = −(∆f )g + Hessf − f Ric,

where Ric, ∆ and Hess stand, respectively, for the Ricci tensor, the Laplacian
operator and the Hessian form on M n; see for instance [4]. Therefore, (1.1) can be
rewritten as

(1.2)

− (∆f )g + Hessf − f Ric = g.

Miao and Tam [17] were able to show that these critical metrics arise as critical
points of the volume functional on M n when restricted to the class of metrics g
with prescribed constant scalar curvature such that g|T ∂M = h for a prescribed
Riemannian metric h on the boundary. Afterward, Corvino, Eichmair and Miao [8]

studied the modiﬁed problem of ﬁnding stationary points for the volume functional

on the space of metrics whose scalar curvature is equal to a given constant. From

Theorem 7 in [17], Miao-Tam critical metrics have constant scalar curvature R.

Some explicit examples of Miao-Tam critical metrics can be found in [17]. Those
examples were obtained on connected domain with compact closure in Rn, Hn and
Sn. For the sake of completeness, it is very important to underline ones.

Let us start with the Euclidean space (Rn, g), where g is its canonical metric.

Example 1 ([17]). We consider Ω to be a Euclidean ball in Rn of radius r. Suppose
that

f = −

1

2(n − 1)|x|2 +

1

2(n − 1)

r2,

where x ∈ Rn. Under these conditions, it is not hard to check that (Ω, g, f ) is a
Miao-Tam critical metric.

At the same time, we present a similar example as before on the standard sphere

(Sn, g0), where g0 is its canonical metric.

CRITICAL METRICS OF THE VOLUME FUNCTIONAL

3

Example 2 ([17]). Let Ω be a geodesic ball in Sn ⊂ Rn+1 with radius r0 6= π
2 .
Suppose that

f =

1

n − 1(cid:16) cos r

cos r0 − 1(cid:17),

where r is the geodesic distance from the point (0, ..., 0, 1). Therefore, f = 0 on the

boundary of Ω and f satisﬁes (1.2). Moreover, if Ω is contained in a hemisphere,

then (Ω, g0, f ) is also a Miao-Tam critical metric.

Reasoning as in the spherical case it is not diﬃcult to build a similar example

on the hyperbolic space Hn.

Example 3 ([17]). Regarding the hyperbolic space Hn embed in Rn,1, the Minkowski
space, with standard metric dx2

1 + ... + dx2

n − dt2 such that

Hn = {(x1, ..., xn, t)| x2

1 + ... + x2

n − t2 = −1, t > 0}.

We assume that Ω is a geodesic ball in Hn with center at (0, ..., 0, 1) and geodesic

radius r0. Suppose that

f =

1

n − 1(cid:16)1 −

cosh r

cosh r0(cid:17),

where r is the geodesic distance form the point (0, ..., 0, 1). Similarly, we have that

f = 0 on the boundary of Ω and f satisﬁes (1.2). For more details see [17].

It is natural to ask whether these examples are the only Miao-Tam critical met-

rics. In this sense, inspired by ideas developed by Kobayashi [14], Kobayashi and

Obata [15], Miao and Tam [18] gave a partial answer to this question.

In fact,

they proved that a locally conformally ﬂat simply connected, compact Miao-Tam
critical metric (M n, g, f ) with boundary isometric to a standard sphere Sn−1 must
be isometric to a geodesic ball in a simply connected space form Rn, Hn or Sn. This
result was improved in dimensions 3 and 4 in [3]. More precisely, Barros, Di´ogenes

and Ribeiro [3], based on the techniques outlined in [6], proved that a Bach-ﬂat

simply connected, four-dimensional compact Miao-Tam critical metric with bound-
ary isometric to a standard sphere S3 must be isometric to a geodesic ball in a
simply connected space form R4, H4 or S4. In addition, they showed that in dimen-
sion three the result even is true replacing the Bach-ﬂat condition by the weaker
assumption that M 3 has divergence-free Bach tensor.

At the same time, by assuming the Einstein condition, Miao and Tam [18] were

able to remove the condition of boundary isometric to a standard sphere. More

precisely, they proved the following result.

Theorem 1 (Miao-Tam, [18]). Let (M n, g, f ) be a connected, compact Einstein
Miao-Tam critical metric with smooth boundary ∂M. Then (M n, g) is isometric to
a geodesic ball in a simply connected space form Rn, Hn or Sn.

4

R. BATISTA, R. DI ´OGENES, M. RANIERI, AND E. RIBEIRO JR

Recently, Baltazar and Ribeiro [2] improves Theorem 1 by replacing the as-

sumption of Einstein in the Miao-Tam result by the parallel Ricci tensor condition,

which is weaker that the former. See the work of Corvino, Eichmair and Miao [8]

for further results related.

Before to proceed, let us point out that the formal adjoint of the linearization

of the scalar curvature plays an important role in problems related to prescribing

the scalar curvature function. We also recall that a complete Riemannian manifold
M n with boundary ∂M (possibly empty) is said to be static if it admits a smooth
non-trivial solution λ ∈ C∞(M ) to the equation

(1.3)

L∗

g(λ) = 0.

It is well-known that the existence of a static potential imposes many restrictions

on the geometry of the underlying manifold. For more details see, for instance, [22].

We recall that Fischer-Marsden [11] conjectured that a standard sphere is the

only solution to the equation (1.3) on compact manifold. A counter-example to

the Fischer-Marsden conjecture was obtained when g is conformally ﬂat, for more

details, we refer the reader to [14] and [16]. However, a classical result states that

the standard hemisphere has the maximum possible boundary area among static

three-manifolds with positive scalar curvature and connected boundary. More pre-

cisely, a result due to Shen [20] and Boucher-Gibbons-Horowitz [5] asserts that the

boundary ∂M of a compact three-dimensional oriented static manifold with con-

nected boundary and scalar curvature 6 must be a 2-sphere whose area satisﬁes the
inequality |∂M| ≤ 4π. Moreover, the equality holds if and only if M 3 is equivalent
to the standard hemisphere. A similar result was obtained by Hijazi, Montiel and

Raulot [13].

Based on the above result and taking into account that Miao-Tam critical metrics

have constant scalar curvature, we shall estimate the area of the boundary of a

compact three-manifold satisfying (1.1). We now state our ﬁrst result as follows.

Theorem 2. Let (M 3, g, f ) be a compact, oriented, Miao-Tam critical metric with

connected boundary ∂M and nonnegative scalar curvature. Then ∂M is a 2-sphere

and

(1.4)

|∂M| ≤

4π

C(R)

,

6 + 1

where C(R) = R
4|∇f |2 is constant. Moreover, the equality in (1.4) holds if and
only if (M 3, g) is isometric to a geodesic ball in a simply connected space form R3
or S3.

CRITICAL METRICS OF THE VOLUME FUNCTIONAL

For what follows, we remember that Ambrozio [1] obtained some classiﬁcation

results for static three-manifolds with positive scalar curvature. To do so, he pro-

vided a B¨ochner type formula for three-dimensional static manifolds involving the

traceless Ricci tensor and the Cotton tensor. For our purposes we recall that the

Weyl tensor W is deﬁned by the following decomposition formula

Rijkl = Wijkl +

n − 2(cid:0)Rikgjl + Rjlgik − Rilgjk − Rjkgil(cid:1)

1

R

(1.5)

−

(n − 1)(n − 2)(cid:0)gjlgik − gilgjk(cid:1),

where Rijkl stands for the Riemann curvature tensor, whereas the Cotton tensor C

is given by

(1.6)

Cijk = ∇iRjk − ∇jRik −

1

2(n − 1)(cid:0)∇iRgjk − ∇jRgik).

Note that Cijk is skew-symmetric in the ﬁrst two indices and trace-free in any two
indices. We also remember that W ≡ 0 in dimension three.

In the sequel, motivated by [1], we provide a B¨ochner type formula for Miao-Tam

critical metrics, which is similar to Ambrozio’s formula obtained for static spaces.

Let us point out that our arguments designed for the proof of such a formula diﬀer

signiﬁcantly from [1]. Here, we shall use a formula involving the commutator of the

Laplacian and Hessian acting on functions outlined in [21]. More precisely, we have

established the following result.

Theorem 3. Let (M 3, g, f ) be a compact, oriented, connected Miao-Tam critical

metric with smooth boundary ∂M. Then we have:

(1.7)

div(cid:16)f∇| ˚Ric|2(cid:17) = (cid:16)|∇ ˚Ric|2 + |C|2

where C stands for the Cotton tensor and ˚Ric is the traceless Ricci tensor.

2| ˚Ric|2,

Finally, as an application of Theorem 3 and Theorem 1 we obtain the following

rigidity result.

Corollary 1. Let (M 3, g, f ) be a compact, oriented, connected Miao-Tam critical

metric with smooth boundary ∂M and positive scalar curvature, f is also assumed

to be nonnegative. Suppose that

(1.8)

| ˚Ric|2 ≤

R2

.

Then M 3 is isometric to a geodesic ball in S3.

2. Preliminaries

In this section we shall present some preliminaries which will be useful for the es-

tablishment of the desired results. Firstly, we recall that the fundamental equation

of a Miao-Tam critical metric (1.1) becomes

(2.1)

− (∆f )g + Hessf − f Ric = g.

For simplicity, we can rewrite equation (2.1) in the tensorial language as follows

(2.2)

− (∆f )gij + ∇i∇jf − f Rij = gij.

In particular, tracing (2.1) we have

(2.3)

(n − 1)∆f + Rf = −n.

From this, it is easy to check that

(2.4)

f ˚Ric = Hess f +

Rf + n
n(n − 1)

g,

where ˚T stands for the traceless of T. We also have

(2.5)

f ˚Ric = ˚Hessf.

The following lemma, obtained previously [3], will be useful.

Lemma 1 ([3]). Let (cid:0)M n, g, f ) be a Miao-Tam critical metric. Then
f(cid:0)∇iRjk − ∇jRik(cid:1) = Rijks∇sf +

n − 1(cid:0)∇if gjk − ∇jf gik(cid:1) −(cid:0)∇if Rjk − ∇jf Rik(cid:1).

R

We now recall the following well-known lemma.

Lemma 2. Let T be a (0, 2)-tensor on a Riemannian manifold (M n, g) then

div(T (φZ)) = φ(divT )(Z) + φh∇Z, Ti + T (∇φ, Z),

for all Z ∈ X(M ) and any smooth function φ on M.

We also remember that if φ : Σ → M is an immersion and h denotes the second

fundamental form, we have the Gauss Equation:

(2.6)

RΣ
ijkl = Rijkl − hilhjk + hikhjl.

For more details see [9].

In the sequel we compute the commutator of the Laplacian and Hessian acting

on functions. A detailed proof can be found in [21].

CRITICAL METRICS OF THE VOLUME FUNCTIONAL

Lemma 3. Let f ∈ C 4(M ). Then we have:

(∆∇2f )ij = ∇2

ij ∆f + (Rjpgik + Ripgjk − 2Rikjp)∇k∇pf
+(∇iRjp + ∇j Rpi − ∇pRij )∇pf,

where ∇2 also stands for the Hessian.
Proof. Since this lemma is crucial for the establishment of Theorem 3, we include

its proof here for the sake of completeness. To do so, we adopt the notation used

in [21]. In fact, by using the Ricci identity, it is easy to check that

(∆∇2f )ij = gkl∇k∇l∇i∇jf

= gkl∇k[∇i∇l∇jf + Rlijp∇pf ]
= gkl∇k∇i∇j∇lf + gkl∇kRlijp∇pf + gklRlijp∇k∇pf
= I + II,

(2.7)

where

I = gkl∇k∇i∇j∇lf

= gkl[∇i∇k∇j∇lf + Rkijp∇p∇lf + Rkilp∇j∇pf ]
= gkl[∇i(∇j∇k∇lf + Rkjlp∇pf )] + Rkijp∇p∇kf + Rip∇j∇pf
= ∇i∇j ∆f + ∇i(Rjp∇pf ) − Rikjp∇k∇pf + Rip∇j∇pf,

and the second term is

II = gkl∇kRlijp∇pf + gklRlijp∇k∇pf
= −gkl∇kRjpil∇pf + Rlijp∇l∇pf
= −(∇pRji − ∇jRpi)∇pf − Riljp∇l∇pf
= −∇pRji∇pf + ∇jRpi∇pf − Rikjp∇k∇pf.

Here, we used the once contracted Bianchi identity. Rearranging the terms, we

obtain from (2.7) that

(∆∇2f )ij = ∇i∇j∆f + ∇iRjp∇pf + Rjp∇i∇pf − Rikjp∇k∇pf + Rip∇j∇pf

−∇pRji∇pf + ∇jRpi∇pf − Rikjp∇k∇pf

= ∇i∇j∆f + (Rjpgik + Ripgjk − 2Rikjp)∇k∇pf

+(∇iRjp + ∇jRpi − ∇pRij)∇pf,

which allows us to complete the proof of the lemma.

(cid:3)

Next, we deduce a formula involving the Cotton tensor (1.6) of Miao-Tam critical

metrics on three-manifolds. It also plays crucial role in the proof of Theorem 3.

Lemma 4. Let (M 3, g, f ) be a three-dimensional Miao-Tam critical metric. Then

we have:

(2.8)

f 2|C|2 = −4f Cijk∇if ˚Ric

jk

.

Proof. We start invoking Lemma 1 (see also Lemma 1 in [3]) to get

(2.9)

f Cijk = Rijkp∇pf +

R
2

(∇if gjk − ∇jf gik) − (∇if Rjk − ∇jf Rik)

By using the decomposition of Rijkp we have

f Cijk = 2(Rik∇j f − Rjk∇if ) − R(gik∇j f − gjk∇if )

(2.10)

+(gikRjp∇pf − gjkRip∇pf ).

Now, substituting the traceless Ricci tensor into (2.10) we arrive at

(2.11)

f Cijk = 2(˚Rik∇jf − ˚Rjk∇if ) + (˚Rjs∇sf gik − ˚Ris∇sf gjk)

Taking into account that Cijk is skew-symmetric in the ﬁrst two indices we have

−f Cijk ˚Rjk∇if = −

Finally, by using this data, together with (2.11), and remembering that Cijk is

3. Key Lemmas

In what follows, we assume that (M n, g, f ) is a connected, compact Miao-

Tam critical metric with connected boundary ∂M. Under these conditions, since
f −1(0) = ∂M we deduce that f does not change of signal. From now on we assume
that f nonnegative. In particular, f > 0 at the interior of M. Moreover, at regular
points of f, the vector ﬁeld ν = − ∇f
|∇f | is normal to ∂M and also |∇f| 6= 0 along
∂M. Therefore, the boundary condition, together with (2.1), implies

X(cid:0)|∇f|2(cid:1) = 2h∇X∇f,∇fi
= 2∇2f (X,∇f )
= −

2

n − 1hX,∇fi = 0,

where X ∈ X(∂M ). Whence, |∇f|2 is constant along ∂M. In particular, we arrive
at

(3.1)

along ∂M.

∇i∇j f = −

1

n − 1

gij

Remark 1. It is convenient to point out that, choosing appropriate coordinates

(e.g. harmonic coordinates) we conclude that f and g are analytic, see for instance

Theorem 2.8 in [7] (or Proposition 2.1 in [8]). Whence, we conclude that f can not

vanish identically in a non-empty open set. Then, the set of regular points is dense

in M.

Proceeding, following the notation used in [17], the second fundamental form of

∂M is given by

(3.2)

hij = h∇ei ν, eji,

where {e1, . . . , en−1} is an orthonormal frame on ∂M. Of which implies that

(3.3)

hij = −h∇ei ∇f
|∇f|

, eji =

1

(n − 1)|∇f|

gij.

Hence, the mean curvature is constant and then ∂M is totally umbilical. For more

background see also Theorem 7 in [17].

In the sequel, as a consequence of Lemma 2, we deduce an integral formula,

which is useful in the proof of Theorem 2.

10

Lemma 5. Let (M n, g, f ) be a compact, oriented, connected Miao-Tam critical

metric with smooth boundary ∂M and nonnegative potential function f. Then we

have:

(3.4)

ZM

f| ˚Ric|2dMg = −

1

|∇f| Z∂M

˚Ric(∇f,∇f )dS.

Proof. We start choosing T = ˚Ric, Z = ∇f and φ = 1 in Lemma 2. So, since
(M n, g) has constant scalar curvature we infer

div( ˚Ric(∇f )) = (div ˚Ric)(∇f ) + h ˚Ric,∇2fi

= f| ˚Ric|2.

Upon integrating over M we use Stokes formula to obtain

ZM

f| ˚Ric|2dM = ZM

div( ˚Ric(∇f ))dM
= Z∂Mh ˚Ric(∇f ), νidS.

Next, taking into account that f ≥ 0 we have ν = − ∇f

|∇f | . From here it follows that

ZM

f| ˚Ric|2dM = −

1

|∇f| Z∂M

˚Ric(∇f,∇f )dS,

where we used that |∇f| is constant on ∂M. This ﬁnishes the proof of the lemma.

(cid:3)

Remark 2. Notice that if we replace the nonnegative potential function condition

by the nonpositive potential function condition in Lemma 5, (3.4) become

ZM

f| ˚Ric|2dM =

1

|∇f| Z∂M

˚Ric(∇f,∇f )dS.

Proceeding, we use the Gauss Equation (2.6) to obtain the following lemma.

Lemma 6. Let (M n, g, f ) be a compact, oriented, connected Miao-Tam critical
metric with smooth boundary ∂M. Consider en = − ∇f
|∇f | , and pick any orthonormal
frame {e1, ..., en−1} tangent to the level surface ∂M. Then, on ∂M, we have:

R∂M
ij = Rij − Rinjn +

gij,

n − 2

(n − 1)2|∇f|2

where Ric∂M is the Ricci tensor of (∂M, g|∂M ).

Proof. By Gauss Equation (2.6), for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n − 1, we get

R∂M

(cid:3)

We remember that the standard metrics on geodesic balls in space forms are

Miao-Tam critical metrics. So, it is natural to ask if they are the only examples

taking into account the boundary condition. In this sense, Miao and Tam obtained

a classiﬁcation for critical metrics of the volume functional on manifolds with con-

nected boundary and nonpositive sectional curvature (cf. Corollary 3 in [17]). In

the sequel, we obtain a general classiﬁcation for Miao-Tam critical metrics without

assumption on sectional curvature, which can be compared with Corollary 3 in [17].

Proposition 1. Let (M n, g, f ) be a connected Miao-Tam critical metric with con-
nected boundary ∂M and nonnegative potential function. Suppose that the scalar
curvature of (∂M, g|∂M ) is constant. Then ˚Ric(∇f,∇f ) is a nonpositive constant
along ∂M. In particular, ˚Ric(∇f,∇f ) = 0 if and only if (M n, g) is isometric to a
geodesic ball in a simply connected space form Rn, Hn, or Sn.

Proof. Taking the trace in Lemma 6 we achieve

R∂M = gijR∂M

where R∂M stands for the scalar curvature of (∂M, g|∂M ). From this it follows that

2Rnn + R∂M = R +

n − 2

(n − 1)|∇f|2

.

See also Eq. (45) in [17].

Next, since R∂M and |∇f| are constant along ∂M we deduce that Rnn is constant
along ∂M. Of which we deduce that Ric(∇f,∇f ) is also constant along ∂M. Taking
into account that M has constant scalar curvature, we immediately conclude that
˚Ric(∇f,∇f ) is constant along ∂M.

|∇f|

˚Ric(∇f,∇f )dS

Whence, we get ˚Ric(∇f,∇f ) ≤ 0.

On the other hand, by supposing ˚Ric(∇f,∇f ) = 0, we can apply Lemma 5 to

obtain

ZM

f| ˚Ric|dMg = 0.

Since f ≥ 0 we infer ˚Ric ≡ 0 on M \ ∂M. Clearly, by continuity, ˚Ric ≡ 0 in M.
This implies that (M n, g) is Einstein. Now, it suﬃces to apply Theorem 1 (see
Theorem 1.1 in [18]) to conclude that (M n, g) is isometric to a geodesic ball in a
simply connected space form Rn, Hn, or Sn.

The converse statement is straightforward. Thereby, we ﬁnish the proof of the

proposition.

(cid:3)

Remark 3. From Remark 2, if we change the nonnegative potential function con-

dition by the nonpositive potential function condition the conclusion of Proposition

1 is exactly the same

4. Proof of the main results

4.1. Proof of Theorem 2.

Proof. First of all, we already know that M has constant scalar curvature. There-

fore, if M has null scalar curvature we may use the weak maximum principle [12],
jointly with (2.3), to conclude that the boundary condition f −1(0) = ∂M implies
that f is positive in M (see also Theorem 7 in [17]). But, if M has positive scalar

curvature, the boundary condition implies that f does not change of signal. So, we

start assuming that f is nonnegative. In that case, we may use Lemma 5 to arrive

at

and

Hence, we immediately obtain

which can rewritten succinctly as

Easily one veriﬁes that

.

(4.4)

Ric(∇f,∇f ) = |∇f|2R33

= |∇f|2(R1313 + R2323).

This combined with (4.3) yields

(4.5)

Ric(∇f,∇f ) =

Upon integrating (4.5) we get

4|∇f|2(cid:19)|∂M|

Thereby, since that the scalar curvature of M is nonnegative we immediately deduce

Z∂M

KdS > 0.

Therefore, by using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem we conclude that ∂M is a 2-sphere.
4|∇f |2 is a positive constant in (4.7). So,
since ∂M is a 2-sphere we may use again Gauss-Bonnet theorem, together with

Hereafter, we notice that C(R) = R

6 + 1

(4.7), to infer

|∂M| ≤

4π

C(R)

.

In particular, from (4.7) the equality holds if only if RM f| ˚Ric|2dM = 0. This forces

(M 3, g) to be Einstein. Now, we may invoke Theorem 1 to conclude that (M 3, g)
is isometric to a geodesic ball in a simply connected space form R3 or S3. This is
what we wanted to prove.

It remains to analyze the case when f is nonpositive. In this case, from the proof

of Lemma 5 (see also Remark 2), it is not diﬃcult to show that

ZM

f| ˚Ric|2dM =

1

|∇f| Z∂M

Ric(∇f,∇f )dS −

R
3 |∇f||∂M|.

From now on the proof looks like that one of the previous case. In particular,

we arrive at

KdS = −

Taking into account that f is nonpositive we achieve

4|∇f|2(cid:19)|∂M|.

To conclude, it suﬃces to follow the arguments applied in the ﬁnal steps of the ﬁrst

case. So, the proof is completed.

4.2. Proof of Theorem 3.

Proof. To begin with, notice that

(4.9)

1
2

div(f∇| ˚Ric|2) =

1
2h∇f,∇| ˚Ric|2i +

f
2

∆| ˚Ric|2.

It is not diﬃcult to check that

h∇f,∇| ˚Ric|2i = 2h∇∇f ˚Ric, ˚Rici

and

∆| ˚Ric|2 = gik∇i∇k(cid:0)h ˚Ric, ˚Rici(cid:1)

= 2gik(cid:0)h∇i∇k ˚Ric, ˚Rici + h∇k ˚Ric,∇i ˚Rici(cid:1).

Of which we deduce

(4.10)

1
2

div(f∇| ˚Ric|2) = h∇∇f ˚Ric, ˚Rici + f|∇ ˚Ric|2 + fh∆ ˚Ric, ˚Rici.

On the other hand, computing the Laplacian of (2.5) we obtain

(4.11)

(∆ ˚Hessf )ij = (∆f )˚Rij + f (∆ ˚Ric)ij + 2h∇˚Rij,∇fi.

From this it follows that

(4.12)

f (∆ ˚Ric)ij = (∆ ˚Hessf )ij +

R

f ˚Rij +

2

˚Rij − 2h∇˚Rij,∇fi.

We remember that in dimension three W ≡ 0. This data substituted into (1.5)

yields

(4.13)

Rikjp = (Rij gkp + Rkpgij − Ripgkj − Rkj gip) −

R
2

(gijgkp − gipgkj).

Next, we compute the value of (∆ ˚Hessf )ij . To do so, we use Lemma 3 to obtain

(∆∇2f )ij = ∇2

ij ∆f + (Rjpgik + Ripgjk − 2Rikjp)∇k∇pf
+(∇iRjp + ∇jRpi − ∇pRij)∇pf

(4.14)

where

2 ∇i∇jf + (∇iRjp + ∇jRpi − ∇pRij )∇pf + II,

II = (Rjpgik + Ripgjk − 2Rikjp)∇k∇pf.

We shall treat II separately. Indeed, it follows from (4.13) that

16

R. BATISTA, R. DI ´OGENES, M. RANIERI, AND E. RIBEIRO JR

II = (Rjpgik + Ripgjk)∇k∇pf − 2(Rij gkp + Rkpgij − Ripgkj − Rkj gip)∇k∇pf

+R(gijgkp − gipgkj )∇k∇pf

= Rjp∇i∇pf + Rip∇j∇pf − 2(Rij∆f + Rkp∇k∇pf gij − Rip∇j∇pf − Rkj∇k∇if )

+R(gij∆f − ∇i∇jf ).
This combined with (2.3) yields

Upon integrating of the above expression over M we use our assumption to deduce
that (M 3, g) is Einstein. Now, we are in position to apply Theorem 1 (see also
Corollary 1) to conclude that M 3 is isometric to a geodesic ball in S3.

This is what we wanted to prove.
