Molecule Chemistry in Cold Cores

ABSTRACT

The recent discovery of methyl formate and dimethyl ether in the gas phase of cold
cores with temperatures as cold as 10 K challenges our previous astrochemical models
concerning the formation of complex organic molecules. The strong correlation between
the abundances and distributions of methyl formate and dimethyl ether further shows
that current astrochemical models may be missing important chemical processes in cold
astronomical sources. We investigate a scenario in which complex organic molecules
and the methoxy radical can be formed on dust grains via a so-called “chain reaction”
mechanism, in a similar manner to CO2. A uniﬁed gas-grain microscopic-macroscopic
Monte Carlo approach with both normal and interstitial sites for icy grain mantles is
used to perform the chemical simulations. Reactive desorption with varying degrees
of eﬃciency is included to enhance the non-thermal desorption of species formed on
cold dust grains. In addition, varying degrees of eﬃciency for the surface formation of
methoxy are also included. The observed abundances of a variety of organic molecules
in cold cores can be reproduced in our models. The strong correlation between the
abundances of methyl formate and dimethyl ether in cold cores can also be explained.
Non-diﬀusive chemical reactions on dust grain surfaces may play a key role in the
formation of some complex organic molecules.

Introduction

Interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs), which are deﬁned as carbon-containing molecules

with 6 or more atoms, have attracted increasing interest in the past few decades (Herbst & van Dishoeck

2009). Although this deﬁnition can refer to the unsaturated carbon-chain species detected in cold
cores, the acronym is more commonly used to refer to the more terrestrial-like molecules most
strongly associated with hot cores and corinos. The interest in COMs derives not only from the
fact that COMs can be good probes of physical conditions of astronomical sources, but also be-
cause COMs may be the basis of prebiotic molecules, which may be related to the origin of life.
Although COMs were ﬁrst observed in hot cores (Blake et al. 1987), they are also detected in a
variety of other types of astronomical sources in the early phases of star formation (Bottinelli et al.
2004; Arce et al. 2008; ¨Oberg et al. 2010; Bacmann et al. 2012; Cernicharo et al. 2012; ¨Oberg et al.
2015).

Progress in the astrochemical modeling of COM formation has been driven by new obser-
vations of these species. COMs were ﬁrst believed to be synthesized in the gas phase from pre-
cursors formed on cold dust grains and desorbed into the gas as the temperature of dust grains
increased (Charnley et al. 1992). New observations towards hot corinos and the Galactic center
challenged the original hypothesis that COMs are formed in the gas phase (Ceccarelli et al. 2000;
Requena-Torres et al. 2007). Moreover, new experimental and computational results showed that
the gas phase syntheses used in the original models of COMs are not eﬃcient enough to explain
the abundances of methyl formate and other species in hot cores and corinos (Horn et al. 2004;
Geppert et al. 2007). A commonly accepted formation mechanism, which is consistent with ob-
servations in these sources, has been developed (Garrod & Herbst 2006). In this approach, zeroth
generation COMs such as methanol are formed on the growing ice mantles of cold dust grains by
one mobile reactant, typically an atom or a diatomic molecule bound suﬃciently loosely to a grain
to diﬀuse rapidly even at 10 K, and another species. More complex species than methanol may also
be formed by this mechanism. As the temperature increases, photodissociation products of zeroth
generation COMs, which are typically radicals, are able to diﬀuse on dust grain surfaces. The more
strongly bound of these species do not desorb initially; thus, they can recombine via radical-radical
association reactions to produce the ﬁrst generation COMs, such as methyl formate (HCOOCH3).
Subsequent photodissociation and radical-radical reactions produce second-generation COMs, etc.

As the temperature continues to rise, the COMs desorb thermally into the gas, where they can

be detected. Other mechanisms for desorption of COMs include shock processes (Requena-Torres et al.
2006; Requena-Torres et al 2008), in regions such as the Galactic center not closely associated
with hot cores, and non-thermal processes operative at low temperatures, such as photodesorp-
tion ( ¨Oberg et al. 2009). The thermal mechanism can explain in a semi-quantitative sense most
of the COM observations in hot cores and corinos (Garrod & Herbst 2006; Garrod et al. 2008).
Most of the radical-radical recombination reactions used in this model, however, have not been
studied in the laboratory, and complications have been found. For example, the methoxy radical
(CH3O), used in the formation of methyl formate via surface recombination with the formyl radical
(HCO), has not been found on ice surfaces in the synthesis of methanol from CO, leading to the
suggestion that it may be converted into the isomeric form CH2OH and not be available to react
with other radicals (Cernicharo et al. 2012). Of course, laboratory and interstellar time scales for
surface reactions can be quite diﬀerent; nevertheless, more research is clearly needed to conﬁrm the

2

radical-radical mechanism.

The recent detection of methyl formate and dimethyl ether in cold cores with temperatures as
low as 10 K raises more serious questions about the general validity of the radical-radical mechanism
to form COMs ( ¨Oberg et al. 2010; Bacmann et al. 2012; Cernicharo et al. 2012; Vastel et al. 2014)
because radicals can diﬀuse only slowly if at all on ice mantles at 10 K, and so cannot react
eﬃciently with each other.
It must be noted, however, that the studied sources are complex
and the low resolution of single-dish telescopes might result in observations that mix both low
temperature and higher temperature portions. In order to explain the recent detection of COMs in
cold cores, Vasyunin & Herbst (2013a) suggested that the COMs are formed by precursors such
as methanol which are ﬁrst formed on grain surfaces at 10 K and then desorb to the gas phase via
non-thermal mechanisms such as reactive desorption. Even so, they found that it was necessary
to add more gas-phase reactions such as radiative association to produce reasonable abundances
of methyl formate and dimethyl ether. A more recent approach to the gas-phase chemistry by
Balucani et al. (2015) indicates that methyl formate can be formed in suﬃcient abundance via the
gas-phase reaction

O + CH3OCH2 −→ HCOOCH3 + H.

(1)

Moreover, they show that the CH3OCH2 radical is formed from dimethyl ether, leading to a cor-
relation between the abundances of dimethyl ether and methyl formate. This correlation has been
observed by Jaber et al. (2014) over a wide range of sources with diﬀering conditions. However, a
common problem of gas phase routes to form dimethyl ether is that gas phase methoxy abundances
must be high enough in order to produce enough dimethyl ether (Vasyunin & Herbst 2013a). Given
the low fractional abundance of gas phase methoxy (4.7×10−12) observed in B1-b (Cernicharo et al.
2012), it is unclear that dimethyl ether can be formed solely in the gas phase in cold cores. For
instance, in the standard model of Balucani et al. (2015), where the reactive desorption eﬃciency
is set to be 0.01 and gas phase COM formation reactions included, at the time when the calculated
fractional abundances of dimethyl ether and methyl formate ﬁt observations in B1-b, the fractional
abundance of methoxy is more than one order of magnitude larger than the observed value. Thus,
even in cold cores where thermal desorption of COMs is very ineﬃcient, COMs may also be formed
appreciably on dust grains and then desorb into the gas phase via non-thermal processes. Recently
Ruaud et al. (2015) suggested that the abundances of gas phase COMs in cold and dense regions
can be signiﬁcantly enhanced by introducing Eley-Rideal and complex induced reaction mecha-
nisms on dust grains. However, the simulated abundances of methyl formate in their models are
still more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the observed values in both B1-b and L1689b.

In this paper, we employ a diﬀerent mechanism to help explain the detection of COMs in cold
sources as well as the correlation of the abundances of methyl formate and dimethyl ether. Our
explanation is based on non-diﬀusive surface reactions, such as we and others considered for the
case of CO2, which is one of the major components of ice mantles ( ¨Oberg et al. 2011). The most
eﬃcient formation mechanism to form CO2 is the reaction CO + OH → CO2 + H, although it does
possess a signiﬁcant barrier in the gas. In the laboratory, the surface analog appears to proceed via
an Eley-Rideal mechanism, in which a gaseous CO molecule lands on and reacts with a surface OH

3

radical, formed via photodissociation of water (Yuan et al. 2014). The eﬃciency of this reaction in
the interstellar medium has not been determined. Another possible process to enable the CO +
OH reaction is the so-called “chain reaction” mechanism, in which an O atom on a surface reacts
diﬀusively with an H atom to form the OH radical, which can subsequently react with CO without
undergoing diﬀusion if a CO molecule lies right below it (Chang et al. 2007; Chang & Herbst 2012;
Garrod & Pauly 2011). Without the initial reaction between O and H, the O atoms cannot react
eﬃciently with CO since the process has a signiﬁcant barrier. Here, as discussed in Chang & Herbst
(2014), we use the chain-reaction mechanism to produce COMs on the top layers of ice mantles.
Note that chain reactions in our model are allowed to occur only if the radical-radical reactions are
already in the network, so that it is possible that both this mechanism and a diﬀusive one can be
operative, although the role of diﬀusion is limited for the production of COMs at low temperatures.
In Fig. 1, we show how dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3) is formed via a chain reaction in which an H
atom adds to a methylene (CH2) radical on the surface to form a methyl (CH3) radical, which then
can react with a methoxy radical (CH3O) lying beneath the methyl radical. Note also that the
interstitial H atom shown in the ﬁgure (see below for a discussion) does not partake in the process.

Recently, we performed a uniﬁed microscopic-macroscopic Monte Carlo (UMMMC) simulation

using a full gas-grain reaction network with physical conditions pertaining to cold cores (Chang & Herbst
2014). We found that moderate amounts of methyl formate and dimethyl ether could be formed
on dust grains at temperatures as low as 10 K. The major non-thermal desorption mechanism con-
sidered was photodesorption; however, it is not suﬃciently eﬃcient to drive a signiﬁcant fraction of
COMs into the gas phase, so that most methyl formate and dimethyl ether remain on grain surfaces.
In this paper, we report calculated gas phase abundances of COMs in a cold core in a simulation
that includes an eﬃcient reactive desorption mechanism. In this mechanism, the exothermicity of
a surface reaction is used to drive the reaction product into the gas phase.
In addition to this
non-thermal desorption mechanism, we also include a number of improvements to the gas-phase
network. The improved model is able to reproduce observed abundances of COMs in cold sources
as well as the strong correlation in abundances between methyl formate and dimethyl ether.

2. Simulation Methods and Chemical Models

We conﬁne ourselves to a brief explanation of our simulation methods because they have been
explained in detail in earlier papers (Chang et al. 2005; Cuppen & Herbst 2005; Chang & Herbst
2012, 2014), after which our chemical models are introduced.

2.1. Simulation Methods

In our UMMMC approach, the kinetics that occurs on grains is handled by a microscopic
approach, in which the position of all species is known, while the gas-phase kinetics is handled
by a macroscopic approach (Chang & Herbst 2014). In order to simulate chemical kinetics on a

ice mantle. See text for a discussion.

dust grain surface with N binding sites, we put these N sites on a 2L × 2L square lattice where
L2 = N . Nodes in the lattice that have both even numbered x and y coordinates are termed
normal while nodes with both odd numbered x and y sites are termed interstitial. Normal sites
exist both on the surface of a dust grain and in the bulk of the ice, while interstitial sites exist only
in the bulk. Species on normal sites are called normal while species occupying interstitial sites are
labeled interstitial. Normal species on the topmost (surface) layer can hop from one normal site
to another or desorb into the gas phase, while interstitial species can diﬀuse from one interstitial
site to another in the bulk. The surface hopping rate b1 (s−1) from one normal site to its nearest
neighbor at temperature T is determined by the surface diﬀusion barrier Eb via the expression
b1 = ν exp(−Eb/T ), where ν is the trial frequency. Similarly, the interstitial diﬀusion rate within
the ice mantle is given by the expression b3 = ν exp(−Eb2/T ) where Eb2 is the interstitial diﬀusion
barrier while the thermal desorption rate is given by b2 = ν exp(−ED/T ) where ED is the desorption
energy. We set Eb = 0.5ED as in Chang & Herbst (2014). The formation of major species and
COMs on dust grain surfaces is found to be independent of the value of the interstitial diﬀusion
barrier, Eb2 (Chang & Herbst 2014), while the abundance of radicals which are formed in the ice
by photodissociation and bulk diﬀusion of photodissociation products is strongly dependent on
Eb2. Because we only allow reactive desorption to occur on the topmost layer, the value of Eb2
should not aﬀect the abundance of gas phase COMs when reactive desorption is included in the
simulation. We choose a value, Eb2 = 0.7ED, which ensures that the interstitial diﬀusion rate is
slower than the surface diﬀusion rate, while light species such as atomic H can still diﬀuse within
the ice bulk. The desorption energy ED for each species on ice is taken from Garrod & Herbst
(2006) and Garrod et al. (2008).

Hopping, interstitial diﬀusion, and thermal desorption are all modeled as Poisson processes, so
the time interval between two consecutive events is given by ∆t = − ln(X)/bi where X is a random
number uniformly distributed within (0, 1) while bi is the rate of hopping, interstitial diﬀusion or
thermal desorption. A chemical reaction can occur when one reactive species hops into another
site with a reactive species, or, in the chain reaction mechanism, a second reaction occurs between
a newly formed species on the surface and one below it. Interstitial species can also diﬀuse out
of the ice mantle and become normal surface species (Chang & Herbst 2014). Photodissociation
processes are modeled as outcomes of another Poisson process, photon arrival. When photons
arrive and strike the ice mantle, we keep track of the penetration of photons and decide whether
photodissociation reactions can happen or not. The exponential nature of photon penetration is
maintained in our simulation (Chang & Herbst 2014). Another possible outcome of photon arrival
is photodesorption, which only occurs on the topmost 2 layers.

In order to include the reactive desorption mechanism in the UMMMC simulation, whenever a
chemical reaction on the topmost layer occurs either diﬀusively or via a chain reaction, we generate a
random number Y , which is uniformly distributed within (0, 1), and compare Y with a probability
P .
If Y < P , then all products of the reaction will desorb into the gas phase, otherwise these
products will remain on the ice mantle. Products of chemical reactions within the ice mantle still
remain in the bulk, as in Chang & Herbst (2014) . The probability P is the eﬃciency of reactive

6

desorption, which is highly uncertain. On the other hand, it was found that P = 0.01 is large
enough to explain the observed gas-phase methanol abundance while P ≤ 0.1 is the highest value
considered by Garrod et al. (2007). We report simulation results from models with ﬁve diﬀerent
P values, 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.1.

2.2. Chemical Models

The chemical reaction network used is based on the gas-grain reaction network used in Chang & Herbst

(2014). Networks of this type can simulate both the gas-phase and grain-surface chemistry very
well, and predict abundances of many classes of molecules accurately.
in cold cores. Therefore,
in this paper, we will concentrate on species such as COMs not treated by standard simulations,
without discussing most other species in any detail. In particular, we emphasize methyl formate,
dimethyl ether and acetaldehyde, which were found both in B1-b and L1689B (Bacmann et al. 2012;
Cernicharo et al. 2012), as well as the most ubiquitous COM, methanol. Although glycolaldehyde
has not been found in cold cores so far, we still report the abundance of glycolaldehyde for compar-
ison. Moreover, H2CO is a precursor of HCOOCH3 in some gas phase synthetic routes (Horn et al.
2004; Vasyunin & Herbst 2013a), while the simulated abundance of H2CO is more than two orders
of magnitude larger than the observed value in B1-b (Vasyunin & Herbst 2013a), so we also report
the abundance of H2CO in our models.

The cosmic-ray ionization rate is set at ζ = 1.3 × 10−17 s−1. The physical conditions per-
tain to the cold regions of dense clouds where methyl formate and dimethyl ether have been
found (Bacmann et al. 2012): the temperature is ﬁxed at 10 K while the total proton density
(nH) is 105 cm−3. The dust-to-gas ratio is ﬁxed at 10−12, and the visual extinction AV = 10. The
major source of photons under these physical conditions occurs via the ionization of H2 by cosmic
rays followed by electron excitation of H2 leading to photon emission (Gredel et al. 1989). We
start from bare grain surfaces and use the same initial gas phase abundances as in Chang & Herbst
(2014), which are based on the assumption of low-metal abundances. We run each model 25 times
up to a time of 2× 105 yr and take the average of these 25 simulation results so that the minimum
non-zero fractional abundance of each species in the model is 4 × 10−13.

2.2.1. New Gas Phase Reactions

The more important additional gas-phase chemical reactions are listed in Table 1; of these, a few
have been studied at 10 K, while some of the reaction rate coeﬃcients have been extrapolated from
higher temperature values, and still others represent a higher degree of speculation. The important
formation of methoxy in the gas-phase via the reaction between OH radical and methanol:

OH + CH3OH −→ CH3O + H2O

(2)

7

is well studied (Shannon et al. 2013). This reaction proceeds via an intermediate metastable van
der Vaals-type complex, CH3OHOH∗, which can redissociate into reactants or proceed to form the
ﬁnal products via tunneling.

Contrary to our earlier work (Chang & Herbst 2014), we distinguish the methoxy and hy-
droxymethyl (CH2OH) radicals in this study. We include the new gas-phase reactions related to
methoxy, dimethyl ether and methyl formate in Vasyunin & Herbst (2013a) and Balucani et al.
(2015) except chemical reactions involving atomic ﬂuorine because F can be quickly locked in the
form of HF, so that Cl atoms play the major role in converting CH3OCH3 to CH3OCH2 in the gas
phase (Balucani et al. 2015). Moreover, the additional gas-phase loss pathways of CH3O, H2CO,
CH3OCH2, CH3CHO and CH2OH in Ruaud et al. (2015) are also included in our reaction net-
work. Because CH3O and CH3OCH2 are crucial for the gas phase synthesis of COMs, we included
destruction reactions of these two species by ions to complete the gas phase destruction pathways.
The rate coeﬃcients and products of ion - CH3O reactions are set to be the same as those for ion
-CH2OH reactions, which already exist in our gas-grain network. Similarly, the rate coeﬃcients
of ion - CH3OCH2 reactions are set to be the same as those of ion - CH3OCH3 reactions in our
+ + e− → CH3OCH2 + H to
original gas grain network. We also introduced the channel CH3OCH3
complete the gas-phase formation routes of CH3OCH2, and we have included the gas-phase, mainly
destruction, reactions related to glycolaldehyde (CH2OHCHO) (Garrod et al. 2008; Belloche et al.
2014; Garrod 2015).

Shannon et al. (2014) have shown that atomic C can react quickly with methanol at low
temperatures and this reaction may be the major loss process in the gas phase when atomic C
is abundant. We included this reaction in our reaction network. In addition, we included three
reactions involving the radical CH and the species H2O, CH3OH, and H2CO; these are analogs of
surface reactions which are shown in Table 2.

2.2.2. Aspects of COM Grain Chemistry

The methoxy and hydroxymethyl radicals lead to COMs on grain surfaces. Both radicals can
be hydrogenated to produce methanol while only methoxy can react with HCO and CH3 to form
HCOOCH3 and CH3OCH3 respectively, while hydroxymethyl can react with HCO and CH3 to form
glycolaldehyde (CH2OHCHO) and ethanol (C2H5OH) instead. As for their formation, accretion
of methoxy onto the grains is not likely to be important because the fractional abundances of
gas-phase methoxy are found to quite low in the cold cores B1-b and L1544 (Bacmann et al. 2012;
Cernicharo et al. 2012; Vastel et al. 2014). On the grain surface, both methoxy and hydroxymethyl
can be produced via the photodissociation of methanol (Garrod et al. 2008). The hydrogenation of
CO can lead to hydroxymethyl and methoxy. In most models we assume that Y, the methoxy yield
by gradual hydrogenation of CO, is zero because it has been argued that the abundance of methoxy
on grain surface is small and methoxy can quickly isomerize to hydroxymethyl (Cernicharo et al.
2012). We do, however, consider the possibility that Y=0.5 in one model, considering that the

H + H2CO reaction in the gas phase possesses a lower barrier to the formation of CH3O than to
CH2OH, coupled with the high barrier to isomerization in the gas. We also include the analog
of reaction (2) on the surfaces of grains among the new surface reactions in our model, shown in
Table 2. If eﬃcient, this reaction can be the dominant production mechanism for surface methoxy at
certain times. It likely competes with stabilization to form the van der Waals complex CH3OHOH
(Ruaud et al. 2015). Moreover, we also consider the case that the product of reaction (2) is CH2OH
instead of CH3O due to the high exothermicity of the chain reaction mechanism. The radical CH
is important for the formation of COMs on grain surface, as explained in the next section, so we
included three more surface reactions that destroy CH which are shown in Table 2.

We deﬁne a parameter, RP , for the probability that OH and CH3OH, with the radical lying
atop methanol, complete a chain reaction to to form CH3O and H2O or CH2OH and H2O. The larger
the value of RP , the more likely OH can react with CH3OH in the same site. In our simulations,
we utilize values for RP ranging from 10−4 to unity. The parameter RP2 is used to refer to the
probability that OH and CH3OH form CH2OH and H2O. Table 3 shows the values of the parameters
P , RP , Y and RP2 used for diﬀerent models simulated in this work. The models are characterized
by two or three numbers following the letter M. For models with two numbers, the ﬁrst number
refers to the value of the eﬃciency P of reactive desorption; the digits 0,1,2,3,4 refer respectively to
values for P of 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.1. The second number refers to the probability RP . Here
the digits 0,1,2,3 refer respectively to values of RP equal to 10−4, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0. For example,
the model M40 refers to a simulation in which the probability of reactive desorption of products
is 0.1 while the probability that methoxy and water are formed in the reaction between OH and
CH3OH is a small 10−4. If a model has three numbers, the ﬁrst two numbers refer to the same
parameters as those in a model with two numbers, while the third number is an index that speciﬁes
diﬀerent Y and RP2 values. For instance, in model M431, P = 0.1, RP = 1.0, Y =0 and RP2=1.0.

3. Results: The Formation of COMs

In this section, we discuss how COMs are formed both in the gas and on grains followed by
desorption into the gas, in an attempt to determine which mechanism, if either, is dominant for
which molecule. We start with a discussion of the uncertain abundance of the important precursor
methoxy.

3.1. The Role and Abundance of Granular Methoxy

Fig. 2 shows the fractional abundances with respect to nH for HCOOCH3, CH2OHCHO,
CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, CH3CHO, CH3O, CH2OH, H2CO and CH3OH as functions of time on dust
grain ices in models M43 (P = 0.1, RP = 1.0, Y = 0, RP2 = 0) and M40 (P = 0.1, RP = 10−4,
Y = 0, RP2 = 0). In the ﬁgure, the letter J designates granular species. These are extreme cases;
the models in which the parameter RP assumes intermediate values have results in between M43
and M40. We ﬁrst discuss the abundance of methoxy because its existence on ice mantles to any
appreciable degree is now controversial (Cernicharo et al. 2012). In model M43, methoxy can be
eﬃciently formed on grain surfaces by the surface analog of reaction (2) while in model M40, this
reaction contributes little to the formation of methoxy on grain surfaces. Reaction (2) cannot
happen on grain surfaces by a diﬀusive process at 10 K because neither OH nor CH3OH can diﬀuse
appreciably on grain surfaces this cold. Instead, we invoke a chain reaction mechanism, in which
the reaction happens when O combines with atomic H and there is an CH3OH molecule lying below
the newly formed OH so that OH can immediately react with CH3OH to form CH3O and water.

In model M43, the methoxy abundance ﬁrst increases because of the increase in the granular
methanol abundance via hydrogenation of CO followed by surface reaction (2), then ﬂuctuates
before 104 yr, and then increases again because photodissociation of methanol can produce methoxy,
which is buried within the ice mantle.
In model M40, on the other hand, there is hardly any
methoxy on the grain surface before 2 × 103 yr because methoxy can only be formed weakly by
surface reaction (2). Photodissociation of methanol is the major reaction to form methoxy in model
M40, and at later times this mechanism produces as much methoxy as in Model M43. Indeed, after
2×103 yr the abundance of surface methoxy in model M40 increases monotonically. It is interesting
to see that at about 104 yr, the total (surface +bulk) abundance of methoxy in both models M40
and M43 is roughly the same because methoxy formed by photodissociation of methanol that is
deeply buried within ice accumulates and is much more abundant than methoxy on the topmost
ice layer. Nevertheless, the abundance of methoxy on the topmost layer of ice mantle in M43 is
always much larger than that in M40 because the surface reaction (2) is eﬃcient and is the major

pathway for the formation of CH3O on the topmost layer in M43. Moreover, it is the methoxy on
the topmost layer that can react with radicals to form methyl formate and dimethyl ether via the
chain reaction mechanism on grain surface. Methoxy buried in the ice mantle can only participate
in the interstitial chemistry or photodissociation.

The abundance of surface methoxy can be much lower than calculated here if, as discussed
by Cernicharo et al. (2012), laboratory evidence suggests that surface methoxy can isomerize to
CH2OH if it does not react with H ﬁrst to form methanol. The main piece of evidence for this
isomerization is the inability to detect the infrared bands of methoxy. Although the authors suggest
that the isomerization is promoted by proton exchange, it is not clear to us how this process can
occur quickly on an interstellar ice surface, even if it does in the laboratory. We have decided not
to include this isomerization until it is investigated more closely. Calculations of other ion-neutral
processes on ice mantles have been undertaken by Woon (2011). Perhaps some information on
the isomerization could also be obtained from measured abundances of CH3OD and CH2DOH on
interstellar grains. On the other hand, our assumption that methoxy cannot be formed by gradual
hydrogenation of CO can partially oﬀset the absence of isomerization of methoxy in our surface
reaction network.

Fig. 3 shows the fractional abundances with respect to nH for surface HCOOCH3, CH2OHCHO,
CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, CH3CHO, CH3O, CH2OH, H2CO and CH3OH as functions of time on dust
grain ices in model M431 where the product of OH and CH3OH is CH2OH instead of CH3O and
model M432 where the CH3O yield of the H2CO hydrogenation reaction is 0.5. The reactive des-
orption eﬃciency is also ﬁxed to be 0.1 in models M431 and M432. We can see that, similar to
model M40, there is hardly any surface methoxy formed in model M431 before 2× 103 yrs because
there is no eﬃcient methoxy formation process on the topmost layer in model M431. However, if
the CH3O yield of the H2CO hydrogenation reaction is non-negligible, speciﬁcally Y = 0.5 as in
model M432, the surface methoxy abundance in M432 is even slightly higher than that in model
M43 before 2× 103 yrs because H2CO hydrogenation is an eﬃcient surface CH3O formation process
on the topmost layer. After 104 yrs, however, as the accumulation of CH3O formed by photodis-
sociation reactions becomes the major source of CH3O on grain surfaces, methoxy abundances in
models M432 and M431 are almost the same.

3.2. The Production of COMs on Ice

While the larger COMs cannot be detected on granular ices, it is important to consider their
abundance prior to desorption into the gas, if it can occur. We can see that the abundances of
water and methanol, as shown in Fig. 2, always increase with time in both models M43 and M40
because they are continuously formed on dust grains. Since the surface reaction (2) is not the
major reaction to form or destroy water or methanol, the abundances of water and methanol do
not change with the change in eﬃciency of this reaction.

ﬁrst increase with time and then reach a plateau at 105 yr in both models M43 and M40. Similarly,
although these ﬁve COMs can be formed by the recombination of radicals in our surface reaction
network, they cannot be formed on grain surfaces by a diﬀusive process at 10 K because relevant
radicals cannot diﬀuse appreciably on grain surfaces this cold.
Instead, they can be formed by
similar chain reaction mechanisms. Acetaldehyde is produced when CH2 combines with atomic H
and there is an HCO radical lying below the newly formed CH3. Methyl formate can be produced
by a newly formed HCO, which is formed by CH and O, and a CH3O molecule lying below the HCO,
while dimethyl ether can be produced by a newly formed CH3 radical and a CH3O radical lying
below it. The isomer CH2OH can combine with HCO or CH3 to form glycolaldehyde or ethanol
in a similar way to the formation of methyl formate or dimethyl ether. The radical CH2OH itself
can be formed by hydrogenation of H2CO and photodissociation of methanol, so the abundance of
CH2OH as a function of time in both models M43 and M40 is similar to that of CH3O in model M43,
where the surface reaction (2) is eﬃcient. We can also see that because the formation pathways of
glycolaldehyde and acetaldehyde are independent of the radical CH3O on the topmost layer, the
abundances of glycolaldehyde and acetaldehyde are almost independent of the value of RP. On the
other hand, because the formation mechanisms of methyl formate and dimethyl ether are dependent
on the radical CH3O on the topmost layer, the abundances of dimethyl ether and methyl formate
in model M40 are more than two orders of magnitude smaller than in model M43. The plateaus of
methyl formate, dimethyl ether, glycolaldehyde, ethanol, and acetaldehyde abundances , reached
after 105 yr, occur because gas phase atomic carbon is depleted after 105 years as shown in Fig. 4
while surface CH and CH2 are mainly formed by hydrogenation of accreted C from the gas phase.

Fig. 3 shows that if the product of surface reaction (2) is CH2OH instead of CH3O, methyl
formate or dimethyl ether can hardly be formed on grain surfaces in model M431 because only a
few methoxy molecules can be formed on the topmost layer of ice mantle. Moreover, if the CH3O
yield of H2CO hydrogenation takes the non-negligible value of 0.5, a moderate amount of methyl
formate and dimethyl ether can be formed on grain surfaces in model M432 even if the surface
reaction (2) produces CH2OH instead of CH3O. On the other hand, the abundances of surface
species other than methyl formate, dimethyl ether and methoxy in Fig. 3 are not much aﬀected by
the change of surface reaction (2) products and the CH3O yield of H2CO hydrogenation because
the formation of these species is not strongly dependent on the methoxy abundance on the topmost
layer. The abundance of surface CH2OH before 2 × 105 yrs in model M431 is less than 2 times
more than that in model M432 because the CH2OH yield of H2CO hydrogenation in model M431
is 2 times as much as that in model M432. Consequently, the abundances of surface species such as
C2H5OH, which require CH2OH as a precursor in model M431, is about a factor of 2 larger than
that in model M432.

3.3. The Production of Gaseous COMs

Gas-phase COMs can be produced by gas-phase processes, granular processes followed by non-
thermal desorption, or both of the above either in parallel or in series. The fractional abundances

17

of gas-phase COMs, methoxy, and atomic carbon as a function of time for models M40, M41,
M42 and M43 are presented in Fig. 4.
In these models, the eﬃciency of reactive desorption
remains at 0.1, while the eﬃciency of methoxy production in surface reaction (2) increases from
near zero to unity. Similar to the abundances of surface species, the abundances of gas phase
carbon atoms, formaldehyde, methanol, acetaldehyde, ethanol and glycolaldehyde are independent
of the parameter RP while the abundances of methoxy, methyl formate and dimethyl ether typically
increase as RP becomes larger. Methanol can be be continuously produced on grain surfaces via
the hydrogenation of CO, and then be desorbed eﬃciently into the gas phase; however, because
gaseous methanol can be destroyed by gas phase C atoms, its abundance maintains only a moderate
value and then quickly increases as gaseous C is depleted in all models. Glycolaldehyde is another
species that is mainly formed on the grain surface. However, the formation of glycolaldehyde is
strongly dependent on the abundance of the surface radical CH, which is mainly produced by
hydrogenation of atomic C accreted on grain surfaces. So after 105 yr, when the abundance of
gas phase C quickly drops, the formation rate of glycolaldehyde on the grain surface also quickly
drops; thus, the abundance of gas phase glycolaldehyde also drops quickly. As in the formation of
glycolaldehyde, the formation of methyl formate and dimethyl ether on grain surfaces also depend
on accreted gas phase C; however, because these species can also be synthesized in the gas phase,
their abundances ﬁrst drop as gas phase C is depleted and then increase as the abundance of gas
phase CH3O, CH3OH and H2CO increase. Similarly, the gas phase abundance of gaseous ethanol
also drops at about 105 yrs as gas phase C is depleted. In addition to the grain surface formation
route, ethanol can be formed by dissociative recombination of C2H5OH+
2 , which is produced by
two gas phase radiative association reactions in our gas-grain network:

H3O+ + C2H4 −→ C2H5OH+
2 ,
H2O + C2H+
5 −→ C2H5OH+
2 .

(3)

(4)

So, after gaseous C is depleted, unlike glycolaldehyde, the abundance of gaseous ethanol still main-
tain a small value (a few × 10−11) because of its gas phase synthetic routes.

From Figure 4, we can also see that gaseous methyl formate and dimethyl ether have very
low abundances in model M40. As RP increases, desorbed dimethyl ether and methyl formate
molecules become the major source of gas-phase dimethyl ether and methyl formate. In addition,
the gas phase synthetic routes CH3 + CH3O → CH3OCH3 and O + CH3OCH2 → H + HCOOCH3
also become more signiﬁcant as RP increases because the abundances of gas phase CH3O and
CH3OCH3 increase.

In models M41, M42 and M43 methoxy can be produced in both the gas phase and on the
grain surface while in M40, it is mainly formed in the gas phase. The increase of gas phase methoxy
after 105 yr occurs because gas phase species that can react with CH3O such as O, N and C are
depleted and because its precursor, methanol increases in abundance. Acetaldehyde is a COM that
can also be synthesized both on dust grains and in the gas phase. The abundance of gas phase C
also must be high enough in order to produce CH3CHO on dust grains as explained above; however,

18

since CH3CHO can also be produced by the reaction

O + C2H5 −→ CH3CHO + H,

(5)

in the gas phase where C2H5 is desorbed into the gas phase by reactive desorption, the abundance of
gas phase CH3CHO is signiﬁcant at all times in models M40, M41, M42 and M43. Table 4 lists the
dominant synthetic routes for gaseous COMs - gas-phase or grain-surface - for Models M40 M41,
M42, and M43 at a time of 5 × 104 yr. The results show that with an eﬃcient chemical desorption
mechanism (P = 0.1), synthesis occurs mainly on grains with the exception of acetaldehyde.

Similar to model M40, as shown in Fig. 5, gaseous methyl formate and dimethyl ether in model
M431 have very low abundances because the abundance of methoxy on the topmost layer on ice
mantle is very low. Thus, it is diﬃcult to synthesize methyl formate and dimethyl ether on grain
surfacea. After we introduce an eﬃcient surface CH3O formation process, i.e. hydrogenation of
H2CO, in model M432, the abundances of gaseous methyl formate and dimethyl ether are similar to
that in model M43. Generally speaking, the abundances of gas phase species other than methoxy,
methyl formate, and dimethyl ether do not vary much in models M40, M41, M42, M43, M431 and
M432. We can also see that the time dependence of gas phase species in Models M432 amd M431
is similar to that in models M43 and M40 respectively.

3.4. The Inﬂuence of Reactive Desorption

The fractional abundances of gas phase COMs and methoxy as a function of time for models
M02, M12, M22 and M32 are presented in Fig. 6. In these 4 models, we ﬁx RP to be 0.5 while P ,
the eﬃciency of reactive desorption, takes the values 0, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05 in models M02, M12,
M22 and M32, respectively. The products of surface reaction (2) are ﬁxed to be CH3O and H2O,
while hydrogenation of H2CO can only lead to CH2OH. A general feature that is apparent is that
as the eﬃciency of reactive desorption goes from 0 to non-zero, the abundances of COMs become
large enough to be displayed in the ﬁgure. With no reactive desorption, although there is still an
eﬃcient methoxy formation pathway on the topmost layer, the abundance of gas phase COMs are
very low because they or their precursors cannot be synthesized eﬃciently in the gas phase with our
reaction network. However, despite the fact that there is no eﬃcient mechanism to desorb COMs
from grain surfaces, small amount of COMs, especially methanol and acetaldehyde, can be desorbed
into the gas phase by photodesorption. In model M12, where the reactive desorption eﬃciency is
0.01, the fractional abundance of ethanol gains the most, rising from a value below 10−12 to around
10−10, while the abundance of methanol increases by more than one order of magnitude. With
the same increase in reactive desorption eﬃciency, the fractional abundances of acetaldehyde and
glycolaldehyde increase from a value below or slightly above 10−12 to a value that is typically
around 10−11, while the abundances of methyl formate and dimethyl ether increase from a value
below 10−12 to a value that is around 10−11. The fractional abundance of methoxy increases from
a value below 10−12 to around 10−12 before 105 yr and then quickly increases further. As P further
increases from 0.01 to 0.03 and 0.05, we can see that the abundance of all COMs and methoxy

increase further, although generally not as dramatically.

Now, let us consider the time dependence. Overall, we can see that the abundances of all gas
phase species other than formaldehyde in Fig. 6 decrease at a time near 105 yr and then some
species, such as methanol, can recover. The decrease in the abundance of glycolaldehyde at this
time can be explained by the depletion of atomic C in gas phase, as explained in the previous
subsection. The slight decrease in the abundance of gas phase methanol can be explained by the
depletion of CO and gas phase atomic C, which is the major destroyer of methanol in the gas phase.
Afterwards, as gas phase species such as O, which can react with atomic H on grain surfaces, are
further depleted from the gas phase, it becomes more likely that atomic H can hydrogenate CO to
form methanol instead of reacting with species such as O. Moreover, as gas phase C is depleted,
the major destruction process of methanol no longer exists. Thus, the abundance of methanol both
on the topmost layer of the ice mantle and in the gas phase increases again. Since methanol is
the major precursor of methoxy both on the grain surface and in the gas phase, the abundance
of methoxy as a function of time generally follows that of methanol. The decrease of gas phase
methyl formate and dimethyl ether abundances are the outcomes of the decrease of the gas phase
methoxy abundance and the depletion of atomic C in the gas phase. We can similarly explain the
abundance of gas-phase ethanol and acetaldehyde as a function of time. Table 5 lists the dominant
synthetic routes for gaseous COMs - gas-phase or grain-surface - for Models M02, M12, M22 and
M32 at a time of 5×104 yr. It can be seen that a small non-zero value for the probability of reactive
desorption is all that is needed for the eﬃcient production of the COMs, even though acetaldehyde
is formed by a sequence of gas phase reactions following reactive desorption, showing that without
desorption of suitable precursors, even gas-phase syntheses may not be eﬃcient. Acetaldehyde
can also be formed on dust grain surfaces; however, its formation by surface reactions followed by
reactive desorption only accounts for about 5% of its total production.

4. Comparisons with Observations and Previous Models

It is interesting to see how well our simulation results for COMs and the related radical species
agree with observations and the results of previous models. The abundances of COMs in our model
M02 are too low to to be interesting for comparison with observation, so they are excluded from
our discussion below. There are virtually no methyl formate molecules formed in model M40 and
M431, so these two models are also excluded from our discussion. Moreover, no numerical values
for abundances of species in the models of Balucani et al. (2015) are reported, so model results in
Balucani et al. (2015) are only compared with our results brieﬂy. We focus on comparisons involving
the abundances of species in the sources L1689b and B1-b because only the upper limits of the
abundances of methoxy, methyl formate and dimethyl ether in L1544 are available (Vastel et al.
2014).

The comparison with observed values should be made using simulated abundances at the time
of best agreement. In order to ﬁnd this time, one approach is to calculate the conﬁdence parameter

where erf c is the complementary error function, Ri is the simulated fractional abundance of species
i, R
i is the observed abundance of species i and σ is the standard deviation, which is set to be unity
here because we assume the uncertainty of observed abundances to be one order of magnitude.
The value of ki increases as the ratio Ri
approaches unity. However, for UMMMC simulation
R
i
results, we cannot directly use the above equation to calculate ki because the minimum non-zero
fractional abundance of species we can calculate in our models is 4 × 10−13, so that any fractional
abundance smaller than 4 × 10−13 will be 0 by our MC simulation. The reason why we set the gas
phase fractional abundance resolution to be 4 × 10−13 is clear now, because the smallest observed
fractional abundance of the species of interest is that of CH3O, which is 4.7 × 10−12 as shown in
Table 6. So, in order to ﬁnd the best ﬁtting time, we ﬁrst ﬁnd time points, tj, when the number
of species with calculated abundances that diﬀer from their observed values by less than one order
of magnitude is a maximum. If there is only one time point tj, then tj is the time of best ﬁt. If

time points tj, where the sum is only over those species whose calculated abundances diﬀer from
their observed values by less than one order of magnitude. The best ﬁtting time is the time point

there is more than one time point, tj, we then use the above equation to calculate Pm km at all
tn when Pm km is a maximum. Our new method to ﬁnd the best ﬁtting time essentially does not

distinguish between bad values and very bad values. One obvious advantage is that the chosen best
ﬁtting time will have the maximum number of species with calculated abundances diﬀering from
observed values by less than one order of magnitude. The species in Table 6 are used for analysis.
We focus on the time range 5 × 104-2 × 105 yr to ﬁnd the best agreement time since the so-called
early time when calculated abundances of most species agree well with observations lies around 105
yr for cold cores.

Table 6 shows the best-time simulated abundances of gaseous COMs and methoxy in our models
M12, M22, M32, M41, M42, M43, M432 as well as the models M1 and M10 of Vasyunin & Herbst
(2013a) and model B of Ruaud et al. (2015), along with observed values in the cold cores L1689b
and B1-b. The molecules are discussed individually.

• Methanol: The observed abundance of methanol in B1-b is reasonably ﬁt by the values of
previous models except Model B. Because of the inclusion of the destruction of gas-phase
methanol by atomic C, it is now diﬃcult to reproduce the observed methanol abundance
with our models except for models M43 and M432. The time of best ﬁts in models M43 and
M432 is later than that in other models so that gas phase C is more depleted at the time of
best ﬁts in these two models.

• Acetaldehyde: The abundance of this species in B1-b is ﬁt reasonably by all models except
models M43 and M432, i which overproduce it by 1-1.5 orders of magnitude, while models

23

M22 and M32 fail to reproduce the acetaldehyde abundance in L1689b to within an order of
magnitude.

• Methoxy: Detected only in B1-b, methoxy has an observed abundance that is reproduced by

all of our models. The fractional abundances of methoxy in models M1 and M10 (Vasyunin & Herbst
2013a) are more than one order of magnitude larger than the observed value while the result
in model B (Ruaud et al. 2015) can ﬁt the observation reasonably well. Vasyunin & Herbst
(2013a) do not distinguish between methoxy and hydroxymethyl.

• Methyl formate: It is diﬃcult to reproduce the high abundance of methyl formate in L1689b
with any models in which the reactive desorption eﬃciency P is less than 0.1. This statement
includes our models M12, M22, and M32, as well as models M1 and B. For our models in which
P = 0.1 (M41, M42, M43 and M432), the observed abundance in L1689b can be reproduced
only in model M43 and M432 in which RP = 1, but even here the discrepancy is nearly an
order of magnitude. For model M10, in which P = 0.1, the observed abundance in L1689b
cannot be reproduced.
It is easer to understand the lower observed abundance of methyl
formate in B1-b. Our models M12, M22, M32 and model B contain abundances in agreement
with the observed values in B1-b, while model M1 (P = 0.01) still fails to reproduce the
observed abundance. All models in Table 6 with a higher reactive desorption eﬃciency of
P = 0.1 can mimic the observed abundance of HCOOCH3.

• Formaldehyde: The abundances of this species calculated with model M10 are more than two
orders of magnitude larger than the observed values in both B1-b and L1689 while the model
B result is more than one order of magnitude larger than the observed value in B1-b. Our
model results ﬁt L1689b observations well, however, Models M43 and M432 overestimate the
formaldehyde abundance in B1-b.

• Dimethyl ether: Model B (Ruaud et al. 2015), which sets the reactive desorption eﬃciency
P to be 0.01, can reproduce the abundance of CH3OCH3 in L1689b while all other models
with P = 0.01 fail. This stems from a very high computed value for the abundance of
surface CH3OCH3, which, if correct, might be detectable by infrared absorption. Otherwise,
the models that produce reasonable ﬁts to the methyl formate abundance also reproduce
observed values for dimethyl ether.

Overall, only our models M43 and M432 can reproduce the abundances of all species in L1689,

but these two models fail to reproduce acetaldehyde and formaldehyde abundances in B1-b.

There were also attempts to detect ethanol in B1-b (Cernicharo et al. 2012). However, ethanol
has not been detected with a 3σ upper limit to its column density. We estimate the upper limit
of the abundance of ethanol to be 6.7 × 10−12. At the time of best ﬁt for B1-b, because ethanol
can be eﬃciently formed on grain surfaces in our models other than M432, simulated ethanol
abundances in these models are around 10−10 which is more than one order of magnitude larger
than the upper limit of ethanol abundance in B1-b. On the other hand, because the surface
synthesis of ethanol almost ceases due to the depletion of atomic gaseous C in model M432 at the

time of best ﬁt, our simulated ethanol abundance drops to 4.5 × 10−11, which is still somewhat
larger than the upper limit to the abundance in B1-b. Since our simulated ethanol abundances
are above the observed upper limit, some important destruction mechanisms may be missing. One
possibility is the destruction reaction with atomic carbon, which, although unstudied to the best
of our knowledge, may be rapid because the analogous reaction involving methanol is rapid at low
temperatures (Shannon et al. 2014). If we assume the rate coeﬃcient of C + C2H5OH to be the
same as that of C + CH3OH at 10 K, i.e., about 10−10 cm3 s−1, then we can make an order of
magnitude estimation of the signiﬁcance of the reaction C + C2H5OH. The ion-ethanol destruction
routes are the major destruction mechanism in our reaction network. Because ethanol is polar, we
estimate the ion-ethanol rate coeﬃcient to be 10−8 cm3 s−1. The total fractional abundance of
destructive ions is about 10−8. So if the fractional abundance of C is greater than 10−6 the C +
C2H5OH reaction is the dominant destruction mechanism. From Fig. 4 we can see that the C +
C2H5OH reaction may be the major destruction mechanism before 105 yr because gas phase C is
suﬃciently abundant before this time. However, after 105 yr, the ion-ethanol reactions remain the
major destruction routes of ethanol because gas phase C is severely depleted. Our crude estimation
can be conﬁrmed by MC simulations. We included the reaction C + C2H5OH → HCO + C2H5
in the reaction network once again assuming the rate coeﬃcient of C + C2H5OH to be the same
as that of C + CH3OH at 10 K. We then ran models M43 and M432 again. The times of best ﬁt
are not altered by the new reaction. We found that at these times (9.1 × 104 and 1.1 × 105 yr for
models M43 and M432 respectively), the abundance of ethanol drops to about 1.2×10−12 in model
M43, which is below the observed upper limit while the abundance of ethanol in model M432 drops
only slightly to 1.7×10−11, which is still above the observed upper limit in B1-b. Nevertheless, the
inclusion of the reaction between C and C2H5OH improves the agreement with observation.

Recently Vastel et al. (2014) studied COMs in L1544. The fractional abundances of methanol
and acetaldehyde were found to be ≈ 6 × 10−9 and 1 × 10−10 respectively.
In addition, upper
bounds were estimated for methoxy (1.5× 10−10), methyl formate (1.5× 10−9), and dimethyl ether
(2 × 10−10). The standard model of Balucani et al. (2015), which sets P = 0.01 and includes
new gas phase COM formation reactions, can reproduce the observed results in L1544 very well,
while model B (Ruaud et al. 2015) can also reproduce observed results in L1544 except that the
methanol abundance is about one order of magnitude lower than the observed value. At the times
of best ﬁt for B1-b, our models M432 and M43 can reproduce the methanol and acetaldehyde
abundances in L1544. Moreover, the abundances of methoxy, methyl formate and dimethyl ether
in models M432 and M43 lie below the upper limits of abundances of these species in L1544.

It was also recently found that there is a strong correlation between the abundances of methyl
formate and dimethyl ether (Jaber et al. 2014). Speciﬁcally, the abundance of methyl formate
is almost linearly dependent on the abundance of dimethyl ether in various astronomical sources
ranging over ﬁve orders of magnitude.
It is argued that they may have the same precursor or
one species may be the precursor of the other one. The standard model of Balucani et al. (2015)
supports the second hypothesis if these two COMs are formed solely in the gas phase. Our models
suggest that if they are formed on grain surfaces, then they have the same precursor. The radical

26

CH2 is a precursor of dimethyl ether while CH is the precursor of methyl formate in our models.
Dimethyl ether is formed by the gradual hydrogenation of carbon atoms on top of CH3O while
methyl formate is formed by hydrogenation of carbon atoms to CH on top of CH3O followed by
the reaction between CH and O. The radical CH is a precursor of CH2. Moreover, the abundances
of radicals CH and CH2 are both dependent on gas phase C, so the strong correlation between the
abundances of methyl formate and dimethyl ether can be explained via the primal precursor C. It is
also found (Jaber et al. 2014) that the correlation between the abundances of methyl formate and
acetaldehyde is weak, which can be explained by the fact that the gas-phase synthesis of methyl
formate requires diﬀerent precursors from the gas phase synthesis of acetaldehyde. Moreover, the
formation mechanisms of acetaldehyde and methyl formate are not dependent on each other in the
gas phase.

5. Conclusions

We performed UMMMC simulations with an eﬃcient reactive desorption mechanism under
physical conditions pertaining to cold cores, where COMs were recently found. The observed
abundances of gas phase COMs and the methoxy radical in the cold cores L1689b and L1544 can
be reproduced by our simulations at temperatures as low as 10 K while most observed gas phase
COM abundances in B1-b can also be reproduced without overestimating the methoxy abundance.
Moreover, our models can also explain the strong correlation between the abundances of HCOOCH3
and CH3OCH3 and the weak correlation between the abundances of HCOOCH3 and CH3CHO.

The problem of COM formation in cold cores is linked to the problem of CO2 formation on
cold dust grains in our models. COMs can be formed by the same type of chain reactions used
to produce CO2 under cold conditions where diﬀusion of large species does not occur. The CO2
formation on cold dust grains by chain reactions was discussed in the Introduction. Moreover, the
formation of surface methoxy on the topmost layer of an ice mantle also relies on this non-diﬀusive
process. The success of our models further shows that non-diﬀusive chemical reactions should be
included in surface reaction networks for better astrochemical modeling. Such processes include
our chain reaction mechanism as well as the Eley-Rideal and complex mechanisms advocated by
Ruaud et al. (2015). Moreover, reactive desorption plays a key role in the non-thermal desorption
of large molecules formed on dust grains. Successful experiments on this process are adding to our
understanding (Dulieu et al. 2013; Minissale 2014). Experimental results from Minissale (2014)
show that reactive desorption eﬃciency is dependent on surface coverage and varies signiﬁcantly
depending on each speciﬁc reaction. On the other hand, the reactive desorption eﬃciency of
chain reactions has never been reported. Chain reactions are diﬀerent from single reactions in
that they are combination of two reactions, which might enhance reactive desorption eﬃciency
because the energy released by two reactions should be more than that by one single reaction. This
eﬀect could be important if the reactive desorption eﬃciency is low for a single reaction. More
experimental work on reactive desorption should be undertaken to help explain COM formation in
cold astronomical sources.
