m (cid:1) crepant resolutions can be equiv-

alently computed on the compound du Val singularity Am+n−1 × C with a unique crepant resolution.

The topological string partition function with target space on toric singular varieties was deﬁned in [GKMR] via prod-
ucts of the partition functions on their crepant resolutions. We could think of the crepant resolutions as all the possible
evolutions of a singular toric variety where we went through a topological-changing transition from a singular to a
non-singular variety. These resolutions are birationally equivalent but topologically distinct. Before choosing a spe-
ciﬁc resolution we could say that the variety is in a superposition of the different crepant resolutions. Thus, the singular
toric variety free energy is deﬁned as the sum of the contribution for the different topologies, crepant resolutions, and
the partition function (that is, the exponential of the free energy) as the product.

One of the main motivations behind the work [GKMR] was to check if in the computation of the topological string
partition function with target space a generalised conifold, Cm,n := {(x, y, z, w) | xy − zmwn = 0} ⊂ C4, there
exists a preferred crepant resolution. In other words, from a probabilistic point of view, if one of the resolutions carries
more importance (weight) than the others on the partition function. What they found out was that there was not such
a preferred resolution or, in other words, that each resolution on the superposition of crepant resolutions has the same
weight.

In this paper we go one step further and claim that although there is no a preferred resolution of Cm,n it is possible
to deﬁne a new conifold C0,m+n with a unique resolution that produces the same topological string partition function.

1

Explicitly, the topological string partition function with target on the conifold Cm,n is proportional to the one com-
puted on C0,m+n to some power d, see below. Now, the variety C0,m+n ∼= C × Am+n−1 is the compound du Val
singularity cAm+n−1, where Am+n−1 = {(x, y, w) | xy − wm+n = 0} ⊂ C3 is the Am+n−1 singularity (orbifold).
Note that cAm+n−1 has 1-dimensional singularities.

Thus, in a sense, we found a relation or duality between the topological string partition function with target space on
the six dimensional generalised conifold Cm,n and the one on the four dimensional Am+n−1 orbifold.

In general, when we say that there is a duality we mean that there are two equivalent but different descriptions of the
same phenomenon, in the sense that observables in both descriptions can be identiﬁed. Dualities are ubiquitous in
theoretical physics and in particular in string theory. Their importance comes from the fact that when a duality exists,
a system which looks extremely difﬁcult to analyse using the current formulation becomes easier when the dual for-
mulation is used. Some examples of dualities are T-duality, AdS/CFT holography, mirror symmetry, AGT conjecture,
etc.

The kind of relation or duality that we explain in this paper is in the same spirit as T-duality (on the bosonic closed
string theory) where two geometric background can be equivalently used to describe an observable as the partition
function. Thus, although the dual varieties Cm,n and cAm+n−1 are geometrically and algebraically distinct, they are
nevertheless physically equivalent as target spaces for topological strings on singular varieties.

1.1 Topological string partition function

Topological ﬁeld theories of Witten type (or cohomological type) have been used since they were discovered to study
moduli spaces from a ﬁeld theoretical point of view. They borrow tools from quantum ﬁeld theory, which is the frame-
work used to describe the standard model of particle physics, to answer pure mathematical questions.

Topological string theory studies maps from a source Riemann surface of genus g with n marked points to a target
Calabi–Yau space. There are two types of topological strings known as type A and type B. The type A is about holo-
morphic maps and the type B about constant maps. The two types can be related by mirror symmetry, that might also
be called a mirror duality. In these article we are concerned with topological string theory of type A.

The topological string partition function has been used to study different invariants related to Calabi–Yau target spaces
such as the Gromov–Witten invariants which count holomorphic algebraic curves on a Calabi–Yau threefold. Other
kinds of invariants that can be described are Gopakumar–Vafa and Donaldson–Thomas. Although, Gopakumar–Vafa
and Donaldson–Thomas invariants are not associated to maps between a source and a target spaces it has been shown
that they are related to the topological string partition function. In particular Donaldson–Thomas invariants are equiv-
alent to Gromov–Witten invariants, as shown in [MNOP1], [MNOP2].

The type A topological string partition function Z is given by the exponential of a generating function F , known as
free energy in the physics literature, that is, Z = exp(F ). Now, the generating function F is expressed as sum over
the genus g as [CW]

where λ is the topological string coupling constant, ti are K¨ahler parameters of the Calabi–Yau, aijk are triple intersec-
tion numbers, bi is related to the second Chern class of the Calabi–Yau and Finst has a non-polynomial dependence on
ti. The term Finst can be described by different formal series with coefﬁcients given by the Gromov–Witten invariants
or Gopakumar–Vafa invariants or Donaldson–Thomas invariants, which we denote as FGW or FGV or FDT, respectively
[CW].

(1.2)

where the set of rational numbers Ng,β are the Gromov–Witten invariants which count the number of holomorphic
maps from a genus g Riemann surface whose image is in the second homology class β of the Calabi–Yau.

We now recall the mathematical deﬁnition of the Gromov–Witten invariants. We write Mg,n(X, β) for the collection
of maps from stable, n-pointed curves of genus g into X for which

Mg,n(X, β) has a virtual fundamental class of virtual dimension

[f (C)] = f∗[C] = β ∈ H2(X; Z) .

vd = (1 − g)(dim X − 3) − KX (β) + n .

(1.3)

(1.4)

Consequently, dimension of the classes [Mg,n(X, β)]vir is independent of β when X is Calabi–Yau. Moreover, the
unpointed moduli M0,0(X, β) has virtual dimension zero for all g if dim X = 3, so on a three-dimensional Calabi–
Yau, M0,0(X, β) counts curves. Here we recall the deﬁnition for the genus zero case, and refer the reader to [MNOP2,
§ 2] for higher genera.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Assume that the genus g of the curve C is zero, g(C) = 0. Let

where the set of integer numbers nh,β are the Gopakumar–Vafa invariants. From the string theory point of view, they
count BPS states corresponding to M2-branes wrapping two cycles of homology class β inside the Calabi–Yau.

Donaldson–Thomas invariants Here we work with threefolds without compact 4-cycles. In this case, from the
physical perspective, the Donaldson–Thomas invariants counts the number of D6-D2-D0 BPS bound states, result-
ing from D6-branes wrapped on the Calabi–Yau threefold and D2-brane wrapped on a second homology class cycle
β ∈ H2(X, Z).

The Donaldson–Thomas representation of the partition function ZDT = exp(FDT) is

ZDT(X; q, v) =Xβ Xn∈Z eNn,β(X)qnvβ ,
where the set of integers eNn,β(X) are the Donaldson–Thomas invariants.

We now recall the mathematical deﬁnition of the Donaldson–Thomas invariants. As usual OX denotes the structure
sheaf of an algebraic variety X. An ideal subsheaf I of OX is a torsion-free rank-1 sheaf with trivial determinant. It
follows that I ∨∨ ∼= OX. Thus the evaluation map determines a quotient

0 −→ I ev−−→ I ∨∨ ∼= OX −→ OX(cid:14)IOX = ı∗OY −→ 0 ,

where Y ⊆ X is the support of the quotient and OY := (OX(cid:14)IOX )|Y is the structure sheaf of the corresponding

subspace. Let [Y ] ∈ H2(X; Z) denote the cycle determined by the 1-dimensional components of Y . We denote by

(1.10)

In(X, β)

(1.11)

the Hilbert scheme of ideal sheaves I ⊂ OX for which the quotient Y in (1.10) has dimension at most 1, χ(OY ) = n
and [Y ] = β ∈ H2(X; Z). If X is a smooth, projective Calabi-Yau threefold, then the virtual dimension of In(X, β)
is zero, and we write

1.2 Summary of results

The main result of this paper is that, given a generalised conifold Cm,n := {(x, y, z, w) | xy − zmwn = 0} ⊂ C4, the
topological string partition function on Cm,n is proportional to the one on the compound du Val singularity cAm+n−1
to the power of d (with d computed from m and n, see Theorem 2.1), that is,

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the steps followed to compute the partition function on the dual conifolds

to simplify considerably the computation of the topological string partition function on generalised conifolds, instead

m (cid:1) resolutions and cAm+n−1 has only one [GKMR]. Thus, we have obtained a method

Note that Cm,n has N∆ =(cid:0)m+n
of computing(cid:0)m+n

m (cid:1) partition functions it is only necessary to compute one.

The procedure to ﬁnd this result is described schematically on Figure 1.

Apart from the computational advantage, we would like to stress that there is a duality between the topological string
partition functions computed on target spaces Cm,n and cAm+n−1. From the physical point of view, we are relating
a topological string theory with two different target spaces. Note that the threefold cAm+n−1 is actually a product
Am+n−1 × C of a singular surface and a line, thus two real dimensions decouple and we are left with a theory in
4 dimensions. In particular, the partition function can be computed on a six dimensional generalised conifold Cm,n
or equivalently on the four dimensional Am+n−1 orbifold1. Similar to what happens for T-duality in string theory
we obtain two dual geometric target spaces. From the mathematical point view, we expect that there is an intimate
relation between some topological invariants (for example, Gromov–Witten, Gopakumar–Vafa, Donaldson–Thomas
invariants) deﬁned on these two duals conifolds.

1In section 4, we give an explanation for this decoupling from the perspective of Gromov-Witten theory on An × C.

2 Partition function on singular Calabi–Yaus

Given the topological string partition functions for theories with target on smooth varieties, [GKMR] deﬁned the
corresponding partition functions for theories with target on singular varieties. Their method was to take an average
over partition functions calculated over all crepant resolutions. Although the same method applies whenever the
singular space has a ﬁnite number of resolutions, their focus was on Calabi–Yau threefolds. We ﬁrst recall their
construction.

2.1 Toric Calabi–Yau threefolds

Suppose we have a singular Calabi–Yau space X and a ﬁnite collection of crepant resolutions X t → X for index
t ∈ T , |T | < ∞. Assume further that a partition function Zold(Y ; Q, . . . ) deﬁned for smooth Calabi–Yau varieties
Y is known, where Q = (Q1, Q2, . . . ) are formal variables corresponding to a basis of H2(Y ; Z). Additionally, we
suppose that H2(X s; Z) ∼= H2(X t; Z) for all s, t ∈ T .

We deﬁne a new partition function Znew for X as follows. Firstly, we identify the formal variables Q among all the
resolutions. That is, we set

Qs

i = Qt

i =: Qi for all s, t ∈ T .

Secondly, we deﬁne

(2.1)

(2.2)

Znew(X; Q, . . . ) := Yt∈T

Zold(X t; Qt, . . . ) ,

where . . . stands for other possible variables that the partition function could depend on. The new partition function
captures information from all possible resolutions of X, and thus can be regarded as describing the singular variety X
itself.

The main result of [GKMR] shows that the new partition function is homogeneous (see deﬁnition 2.1 below). We
will show that this result implies that cones on weighted projective spaces have a privileged role amongst Calabi–Yau
threefolds, in a sense that we will make precise using the topological string partition functions.

Let us consider the case of toric Calabi–Yau threefolds without compact 4-cycles. Such a threefold X corresponds to a
chain of P1’s. Over these P1’s we have the line bundles O(−1) ⊕ O(−1) → P1 or O(−2) ⊕ O → P1. The topological
string partition function in this case is given by [AKMV, IKP]

Ztop(q, Q) = (M (q))χ/2 Z ′(q, Q) ,

where M (q) is the MacMahon function

M (q) :=

and Z ′(q, Q) is the reduced partition function2

(1 − QiQi+1 · · · Qjqk)ksi si+1···sj .

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

Moreover, χ is the Euler characteristics of X, Q1, . . . , Qχ−1 are related to the the K¨ahler parameters3 associated to the
P1’s, and from the physical perspective q is related to the topological string coupling constant. Note that the number

of P1’s is χ − 1. There are two possible values for si, that is, si = −1 or +1 depending on whether the i-th P1 is
resolved by O(−1) ⊕ O(−1) → P1 or O(−2) ⊕ O → P1.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A partition function Z(q, Q) of variables Q = (Q1, Q2, · · · ) is called homogeneous of degree d if its
reduced part Z ′(q, Q) has the form

Z ′(q, Q) = Y1≤i≤j≤χ−1

∞Yk=1

d

(1 − QiQi+1 · · · Qjqk)k

.

(2.6)

Remark 2.1. The deﬁnition of homogeneous partition function given in [GKMR] is slightly different from ours. Here
we have made a correction, namely to remove the MacMahon factor (2.4) to the power χ/2 that appears in Z but
not in Z ′. Such factor appears in each expression of Z for a given singular threefold as many times as the number
of its crepant resolutions. Their main result states that the new partition function they deﬁne is homogeneous, but the
precise statement actually requires our deﬁnition 2.1.

2.2 Generalised conifolds

Given a pair of non-negative integers m, n, we consider the toric varieties

Cm,n := {(x, y, z, w) | xy − zmwn = 0} ⊂ C4 = Spec C[x, y, z, w].

(2.7)

We refer to this speciﬁc type of toric varieties as generalized conifolds.

Deﬁnition 2.2. A partition function for a Calabi–Yau manifold Y is of curve-counting type if it can be expressed
in terms of the Donaldson–Thomas, Gromov–Witten or Gopakumar–Vafa partition function up to a factor depending
only on the Euler characteristic of Y .
Theorem 2.1. [GKMR] Let X be a toric Calabi–Yau threefold deﬁned as a subset of C4 by X = C[x, y, z, w]/hxy −
zmwni, where m and n are non-negative integers. Let Z(X t; q, Q) be a partition function of curve-counting type.
Then the total partition function

is homogeneous of degree

(2.9)

See [GKMR] for a proof of this theorem and further details.

Now consider the threefold C0,n ∼= cAn−1 given by xy − wn = 0. Section 4 of [GKMR] observes that C0,n are
quotients of C3 by Z/nZ acting on a two-dimensional subspace C2 as (a, b, c) 7→ (εa, ε−1b, c), with εn = 1. These
spaces have 1-dimensional singularities, as C0,n ∼= An−1 × C, where An−1={(x, y, z) | xy − wn = 0} ⊂ C3 is the
An−1 orbifold (with a singular point at the origin). They play an important role amongst all the Cm,n threefolds.
Corollary 2.1. Let X be a toric Calabi–Yau threefold deﬁned as a subset of C4 by X = C[x, y, z, w]/hxy − zmwni,
where m and n are non-negative integers. Let Z(X; q, Q) be a partition function of curve-counting type. Then the
total partition function is given by

Z(X; q, Q) =(cid:16)(M (q))χ/2(cid:17)(m+n

n )Yt∈T

7

Z ′(X t; q, Q).

(2.10)

where M (q) is the MacMahon function and Z ′(X t; q, Q) represents the reduced partition function of the crepant
resolution t.
Proof. By Theorem 2.1,

Ztot(X; q, Q) = Yt∈T

Z(X t; q, Q),

We know, by [GKMR], that the number of crepant resolutions of X is(cid:0)m+n
n (cid:1).

Given X t a crepant resolution of X, it follows that

2.2.1 Partition functions on Cm,n and cAm+n−1

Note that by Proposition 4.1 (1) of [GKMR] the number of triangles on each triangulation of Cm,n (which is m + n)
is equal to the number of triangles in the unique triangulation of C0,m+n ∼= cAm+n−1. It follows that the factors of
the product

(1 − Qi · · · Qjqk)ksi···sj

(2.14)

Y1≤i≤j≤χ−1

are equal up to the powers sk’s; in fact, all such resolutions have the same number of Q′
over the same indices 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ χ − 1, only the exponents si vary according to the resolution.

is, hence the summation runs

Now let X = C[x, y, z, w]/hxy − zmwni and Y = C[x, y, z, w]/hxy − wm+ni. The partition function of C0,l ∼=
cAl−1 has degree d = 1 for all positive integer l, see Theorem 2.1. This implies that the partition function of Y is
homogeneous of degree 1, so we can write

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.15)

(2.16)

On the other hand, from Theorem 2.1, the partition function of X is homogeneous of degree d. Therefore,

Z ′(Y ; q, Q) = Y1≤i≤j≤χ−1
Z ′(X; q, Q) = Y1≤i≤j≤χ−1

(1 − Qi · · · Qjqk)k.

.

So we proved the following corollary of Theorem 2.1:
Corollary 2.2. Let X, Y be singular Calabi–Yau threefolds deﬁned as subsets of C4 by X = C[x, y, z, w]/hxy −
zmwni and Y = C[x, y, z, w]/hxy − wm+ni, respectively. Then

Z ′(X; q, Q) = Z ′(Y ; q, Q)d,

(2.17)

where d is the degree of Ztot(X; q, Q).

8

By Corollary 2.1 and Corollary 2.2 the partition function of X = C[x, y, z, w]/hxy − zmwni is completely described
by

where Y = C[x, y, z, w]/hxy − wm+ni.

Ztop(X; q, Q) =(cid:16)(M (q))χ/2(cid:17)(m+n

m )

Z ′(Y ; q, Q)d,

(2.18)

Thus, we have explicitly shown a relation between the topological string partition function on a Calabi–Yau three-
fold of the form X = C[x, y, z, w]/hxy − zmwni, hence a generalised conifold Cm,n, and one of the form Y =
C[x, y, z, w]/hxy − wm+ni, a compound du Val singularity cAm+n−1. As we have pointed out the computation on

C0,m+n ∼= cAm+n−1 is simpler because Cm,n has(cid:0)m+n

m (cid:1) resolutions whereas cAm+n−1 has only one.

3 Example

We now illustrate the different ways to calculate partition functions exploring one concrete example in full details.
Consider X = C2,3 := C[x, y, z, w]/hxy−z2w3i, so that the crepant resolutions of X are represented by X1, . . . , X10
as depicted on Figure 2, where a green line represents a resolution by O(−1) ⊕ O(−1) → P1 and a red line represents
a resolution by O(−2) ⊕ O → P1. We can compute the partition function of the singular threefold X in two ways:
either directly from deﬁnition (2.2), or through expression (2.18) that uses the threefold C0,5.

Firstly, to calculate directly from the deﬁnition, we write down the partition function for each crepant resolution. The
10 crepant resolutions and their corresponding partition functions are:

(1 − Q1qk)k(1 − Q1Q2qk)k(1 − Q1Q2Q3qk)−k(1 − Q1Q2Q3Q4qk)−k

(1 − Q2qk)k(1 − Q2Q3qk)−k(1 − Q2Q3Q4qk)−k(1 − Q3qk)−k(1 − Q3Q4qk)−k(1 − Q4qk)k

After calculating these 10 partition functions individually for the crepant resolutions of X we take their product, thus
obtaining:

1

(1 − Q1qk)−2k(1 − Q1Q2qk)−2k(1 − Q1Q2Q3qk)−2k(1 − Q1Q2Q3Q4qk)−2k

(1 − Q2qk)−2k(1 − Q2Q3qk)−2k(1 − Q2Q3Q4qk)−2k(1 − Q3qk)−2k(1 − Q3Q4qk)−2k(1 − Q4qk)−2k

Z(X, q, Q) =   ∞Yk=1
=   ∞Yk=1

(1 − Q1qk)k(1 − Q1Q2qk)k(1 − Q1Q2Q3qk)k(1 − Q1Q2Q3Q4qk)k

.

Secondly, using expression (2.18) we consider the auxiliary threefold Y = C0,5 := C[x, y, z, w]/hxy − w5i which
has a unique crepant resolution, see Figure 3, and partition function given by:

Z(Y ; q, Q) =   ∞Yk=1

1

(1 − qk)k!χ/2 ∞Yk=1

(1 − Q1qk)k(1 − Q1Q2qk)k(1 − Q1Q2Q3qk)k(1 − Q1Q2Q3Q4qk)k

(1 − Q2qk)k(1 − Q2Q3qk)k(1 − Q2Q3Q4qk)k(1 − Q3qk)k(1 − Q3Q4qk)k(1 − Q4qk)k.

Since the reduced partition function of X satisﬁes

Z ′(X; q, Q) = Z ′(Y ; q, Q)d,

11

where d = (m+n−2)!

m!n!

(m2 − m + n2 − n − 2mn) = −2, it follows that the partition function of X is

Z(X, q, Q) =   ∞Yk=1

4 Final remarks

Although the other compound du Val singularities cD and cE type, are not toric varieties, it could be expected that in
these cases there exists as well a dual variety in 4D with equivalent topological string partition function. We plan to
address this issue in future work.

D. Maulik gave a complete solution for the reduced Gromov-Witten theory of An singularities, for any genus and
arbitrary descendent insertions in [M]. He also studied and described the threefold An × P1. Now, if instead of P1
we have the complex plane C, that is, we want to describe Gromov-Witten theory on An × C, then any curve gets
contracted under the projection to C, so it is basically the same as the Gromov-Witten theory of An with a Hodge class
inserted. The solution on the threefold An × C can also be obtained from the An × P1 studied in [M] by restricting to
the β = 0 constant map case (we are grateful to Davesh Maulik for explaining this point to us).
Hopefully the proposed duality extends to arbitrary descendent insertions (or, from a physical point of view, equiva-
lence of correlation functions of operators described by descendent insertions) and not only to the partition function,
then, using the correspondence between Cm,n and Am+n−1 × C, in principle, we should be able to write the com-
plete solution for Gromov-Witten theory on generalised conifolds Cm,n. In other words, the Gromov-Witten invariants
on Cm,n could be equivalently computed on the simpler variety Am+n−1 × C. We will tackle this point in future work.

We would like to emphasise that the duality that we have been describing is essentially between the six dimensional
variety Cm,n and the four dimensional one Am+n−1, as suggested by Maulik the Gromov-Witthen theory on An × C
is basically the same as the Gromov-Witten theory of An with a Hodge class inserted.

Acknowledgements

The idea of comparing the partition function on Cm,n and C0,m+n came from a discussion of Piotr Sułkowski and
the ﬁrst author. We are thankful to P. Sułkowski whose suggestions inspired this work. We thank Davesh Maulik for
clarifying the relation between Gromov-Witten theory on the varieties: Am × C, Am and Am × P1.
