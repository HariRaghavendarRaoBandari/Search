We study the Keldysh Green’s function of the Weyl-fermion surface state of the three-dimensional topolog-
ical insulator coupled with a space-time dependent magnetization in the gradient expansion. Based on it we
analyze the electric charge and current densities as well as the energy density and current induced by spatially
and temporally slowly-varying magnetization ﬁelds. We show that all the above quantities except the energy
current are generated by the emergent electromagnetic ﬁelds. The energy current emerges as the circular current
reﬂecting the spatial modulation of an induced gap of the Weyl fermion.

INTRODUCTION

Top Surface 

Topological states of matter is one of the most important
topics in the modern physics. Originating from prototypes
such as integer quantum Hall systems [1–3] and polyacety-
lene [4], new types of topological states of matter called the
topological insulator (TI) and the topological superconductor
(TSC) have been discovered and attracted much attention [5–
9]. One of the most remarkable features of the TI and TSC
is the bulk-edge correspondence. The TI and TSC have topo-
logically nontrivial bulk band structure associated with ﬁnite
topological invariants, while the vacuum is topologically triv-
ial with zero topological invariant. They cannot be adiabat-
ically connected to each other, and in order to realize the
topological phase transition from the topologically nontriv-
ial sector to the topologically trivial sector, the existence of
the gapless surface states are necessary. They are related to
the symmetry which systems possess, for instance, the edge
states in two-dimensional topological insulator are called the
helical edge states characterized by the time-reversal symme-
try, while those in the topological superconductor are called
the Majorana fermions associated with the particle-hole sym-
metry. The classiﬁcation of the topological states of matters
by the symmetry [10] and ﬁnding the new topological materi-
als are interesting future directions.

Another direction is to study the transport phenomena of
the surface states in the topological matters. One candidate
is the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic TI which is realized,
for instance, by dopping the magnetic impurities such as Cr
or Mn [11–16]. We display the schematic illustration of the
3D magnetic TI in FIG. 1. The energy gap of the surface
state is induced due to the exchange coupling. The surface
state of the 3D TI is effectively described as the Weyl fermion
with spin-momentum locking. Various functionality owing to
charge and spin of the Weyl-surface state can be expected,
and indeed, rich variety of the electric and magnetic phen-
emona owing to the coupling between the magnetization and
the Weyl fermion have been shown both theoretically and ex-
perimentally [11–25], and might have potential for the appli-
cations to the spintronics [16, 26]. Therefore, the study of
the transport phenomena of the Weyl-surface state of the 3D
TI controlled magnetically is important for understanding the

surface (the blue rectangle) is represented by the blue arrows.

non-equilibrium physics of the topological states of matter as
well as the spintronics applications.

In this paper, we theoretically investigate the transport
properties of the Weyl surface state in the 3D magnetic TI.
We study the electric charge and current densities as well as
the energy density and the current driven by the magnetiza-
tion ﬁelds varying slowly with respect to space and time. We
use the gradient expansion approach by retaining the deriva-
tive terms of the magnetization ﬁelds up to the ﬁrst order,
and derive the Keldysh Green’s function describing the non-
equilibrium state of the Weyl fermion. It is the main result of
this paper, and based on it we can systematically analyze the
transport phenomena of the Weyl fermion generated by the
magnetization ﬁelds.

Due to the exchange interaction between the magnetization
ﬁelds and the Weyl fermion, the in-plane magnetization ﬁelds
act as vector potentials [20]. Then it is natural to introduce
“emergent” electromagnetic ﬁelds described by the above vec-
tor potential. We demonstrate that the various transport phe-
nomena induced by the magnetization ﬁelds are clearly rep-
resented as responses to the emergent electromagnetic ﬁelds.
For the energy current it cannot be described in terms of the
emergent electromagnetic ﬁelds. It is the circular current de-
scribing a spatial modulation of the energy gap of the Weyl
fermion.

This paper is organized as follows.

II, we ﬁrst
present the Hamiltonian and the energy spectrum of the sys-
tem. Then we show how the in-plane magnetization ﬁelds

coupled to the Weyl fermion and act as vector potentials, and
introduce the emergent electromagnetic ﬁelds. Next by using
the gradient expansion, we derive the Keldysh Green’s func-
tion up to the ﬁrst-order derivative of the magnetization ﬁelds.
The transport quantities are calculated based on this Green’s
function. In Sec. III, we present the analysis of the electric
charge and the current densities. We show that the electric
charge is induced by the emergent magnetic ﬁeld, whereas
the electric current density is induced by the emergent electric
ﬁeld showing the quantized anomalous Hall effect. In Sec.
IV, we analyze the energy density and current. We demon-
strate that the energy current is the circular current described
in terms of the spatial derivative of the out- plane component
of the magnetization ﬁeld. Sec. V is devoted to the conclusion
of this paper.

II. GRADIENT EXPANSION APPROACH

A. Hamiltonian

We analyze the dynamics of the Weyl surface state of the
three-dimensional topological insulators coupled with a mag-
netization ﬁeld varying slowly with respect to the space-time.
Focusing on one of the layer, saying the top layer, the low
energy effective Hamiltonian is given by

(b) The dipersion relations for the Weyl fermion with the magneti-
zation ﬁelds. The in-plane magnetization ﬁelds shift the Weyl point
to (−m

ergy gap with its magnitude 2|m

with e < 0 the electric charge and the associated “emergent”
electromagnetic ﬁelds

where vF, µ, and ma(x, t) (a = x, y, z) are the Fermi veloc-
ity, the chemical potential, magnetization ﬁelds, σa(x, t) (a =
x, y, z) are the Pauli matrices, and 12×2 the 2 × 2 unit matrix,
respectively, with x = (x, y) being the two-dimensional co-

ordinate. Here ma(x, t) satisfy Pa(ma)2 = m2, with m

a exchange coupling constant. The summation is taken for
the repeated index a. The ﬁrst term in (1) represents the spin-
momentum locking, while the second term ma(x, t)σa is the
exchange term. Here we set µ = 0 since we are working at
zero-temperature.

The Weyl fermion has the dispersion relations

Ep = ±p(ˇpx)2 + (ˇpy)2 + (mz)2,

(2)

where ˇpx = vFpx + my, ˇpy = vFpy − mx, with px,y denoting
the two-dimensional momentum. As presented in FIG. 2, the
in-plane magnetization ﬁelds mx and my have an effect on
the dispersion relations for the Weyl fermion so that the Weyl
point is shifted to v−1
F (−my, mx), while the z component of
the magnetization ﬁeld mz induces a spatially inhomogeneous
energy gap of the Weyl fermion varying from zero to 2|m|.
The in-plane magnetization ﬁeld mx,y couples with the orbit
of the Weyl fermion through the spin, and behave as a vector
potential. We introduce the vector potential described in terms
of mx,y as

ei(x, t) = −∂tai(x, t),
bz(x, t) = ∂xay(x, t) − ∂yax(x, t),

(4)

with i = x, y. As we see in the later section, the usage of
the emergent electromagnetic ﬁelds enables us to understand
clearly how the electric charge and current densities are in-
duced by the spatial and temporal variation of the magnetiza-
tion ﬁeld.

B. Gradient Expansion and Keldysh Green’s Function

To analyze the transport phenomena of the Weyl fermion
driven by the slowly-varying magnetization ﬁelds, we perform
the Wigner transformation on the Dyson equation and make a
gradient expansion. For the details of the mathmatical treat-
ment of the Wigner transformation and the derivation of the
Keldysh Green’s function, see Appendix A.

To construct the Keldysh Green’s function we ﬁrst intro-

duce the Wigner (mixed) coordinates deﬁned by [27]

with µ = 0, x, y. The coordinate X µ is the center-of-mass
coordinate describing the macroscopic characteristics of the

systems, whereas xµ denoting the relative coordinate repre-
senting the microscopic one. To reveal the non-equilibrium
physics driven by the magnetization ﬁelds characterized by
the macroscopic variable X µ, we derive the Fourier transform
of the Green’s function with respect to the microscopic vari-
able xµ, obtaining the Keldysh Green’s function.

We perform the Wigner

transformation on the non-

equilibrium Dyson equation [27–29]

[K ⊗ G] (1, 2) = δ(1 − 2),

(6)

where G represents the Green’s function and K the inverse of
the Green’s function reading

with the variable 1 or 2 representing the combination of
the space-time and spin variables, 1 = (x1, σa,1) or 2 =
(x2, σa,2) with a = x, y, z, the operator ⊗ denotes the com-
bination of the convolution with respect to space-time and the
matrix product in the spin space. The non-equilibrium Dyson
equation (6) describes the kinematics generated by magneti-
zation ﬁelds. After performing the Wigner transformation on
Eq. (6), we make the derivative expansion up to the ﬁrst or-
der in ∂X and ∂p (or ). The detailed derivation is presented
in Appendix A. As a result, the ﬁrst-order Green’s function is
given by

˜G(1)(X, p) = g012×2 + gxσx + gyσy + gzσz,

−vF(∂X x mz)ˇpy + vF(∂X y mz)ˇpx − vF(∂X i mi)mz

These expressions are the main result of this paper. By using
the above Green’s function, the expectation value of the phys-
ˆJαβψβ (α, β =↑, ↓
ical operators of the Weyl fermion J = ψ†
α
), where ψα is the Weyl-fermion ﬁeld operator and ˆJαβ an op-
erator consists of Pauli matrices or the space-time derivatives,
is calculated as

(9)

where px = Et − xp, and the Tr in Eq. (9) is taken over
2 × 2 matrices. Since the Keldysh Green’s function depends
on both the coordinate X and the momentum p, the opera-
tor ˆJαβ acts not only on the plane wave e−ipx/ but also on
the Keldysh Green’s function ˜G(1)
αβ (X, p). Here we neglect the
X-derivative of the Green’s function ˜G(1)
αβ (X, p), because we
neglect the higher-order derivative terms of the magnetization.

3

We only retain the ﬁrst-order derivative terms of the magneti-
zation ﬁelds.

As we demonstrate in the following sections, we use the
above Green’s function to calculate the physical quantities
such as the electric charge and current densities as well as the
energy density and current.

III. ELECTRIC CHARGE AND CURRENT DENSITIES

Using the Green’s functions in Eq. (8), we now study the
electric charge density and current density induced by the
magnetization ﬁelds. We show that the electric charge as the
response to the emergent magnetic ﬁeld is induced while the
Hall currents are driven as the responses to the emergent elec-
tric ﬁelds as discussed in Ref. [20].

First, the electric charge is calculated as

ρ(1)

e (X, T ) = −ieZ dpxdpydE

(2π)3

Tr[4 ˜G(1)]
sgn(mz)(cid:19) bz(X, T ).

= −(cid:18) e2

2h

(10)

We see that the charge density in Eq. (10) is generated as the
response to the emergent magnetic ﬁeld and its sign depending
of that of the mz.

We next analyze the electric current density. The velocity
operator is deﬁned by ˆv(x) = (i)−1[x, H]. From Hamilto-
nian (1), we obtain ˆvx = vFσy and ˆvy = −vFσx. Therefore,
the electric current densities are given by

jx,(1)

(X, T ) = −ieZ dpxdpydE

The currents (11) are the quantized anomalous Hall currents
generated by the emergent electric ﬁelds with their directions
depending on the sign of the mz. We note that the spin density
Sx,(1)(Sy,(1)) can be identiﬁed with the electric current den-
sity −jy,(1)
)×(evF)−1, and thus, the spin densitiy can
be interpreted as the response to the emergent electric ﬁeld.
In contrast, the ﬁrst order term in the z component of the spin

(jx,(1)

density Sz,(1) = −iR (dpxdpydE/(2π)3)Tr(σz 4 ˜G(1)) is

As a result, when the Weyl surface-state of the 3D TI is
coupled to the magnetization ﬁeld, the electric charge as well
as electric current density are generated by the in-plane mag-
netization ﬁeld behaving as vector potential. Then they are
described as the responses to the emergent electromagnetic
ﬁelds. We note that the results in Eqs. (10) and (11) were also
derived in the Ref. [20] (see Eq. (5)), however, their deriva-
tion is rather phenomenological assuming no sign change of

zero.

order in the gradient expansion, and conﬁrmed there appear
no other terms.

At the end of this section, it is noted that one can easily
verify from Eqs. (10) and (11) that the continuity equation
for the electric charge ∂T ρ(1)
= 0 is
satisﬁed.

IV. ENERGY DENSITY AND CURRENT

In this section, we analyze the energy density and current
by using the Green’s function in Eq. (8). We present that the
energy current is the circular current expressed in terms of the
spatial derivatives of the z component of the magnetization
ﬁeld, reﬂecting the spatial modulation of the energy gap.

To derive the energy density and current, we construct the
energy-momentum tensor. At ﬁrst from the Hamiltonian (1),
the Lagrangian density in this system is

L = ψ†

α[i∂0 · 1 + ivF(σy∂x − σx∂y) − maσa]αβψβ.

(12)

from the

Then

gµν = diag(1, −1, −1), and setting ν = 0, we obtain

Therefore, from the Green’s function (8) the expectaion values
of the energy-momentum tensors are given by

to avoid the ultraviolet divergence arising from the integral

R p[p2 + (mz)2]−1/2dp with p = p(ˇpx)2 + (ˇpy)2. For in-

stance, |mz| ∼ 30 meV and ∆b ∼ 0.2 eV [14]. Thus,
|mz| ≪ ∆b, and the function f (mz, ∆b) in Eq. (15) can be
treated as a constant. In Eq. (14), we see the energy current is
given by the spatial derivative of the mz. It is the term which
cannot be described in terms of the emergent electromagnetic

ﬁelds (or the in-plane magnetization ﬁeld mx,y) and the mech-
anism of its creation can be considered as the spatial variation
of the energy gap 2|mz|. Furthermore, it is the current ﬂowing

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have investigated the charge-current den-
sities and the energy density and current of the Weyl-surface
state in the 3D TI induced by the magnetization ﬁelds. To
do this, we have adopted the gradient expansion approach
and derived the Keldysh Green’s function up to the ﬁrst-order
derivatives with respect to the space and time. The gradi-
ent expansion is valid when the magnetization is the spatially
and temporally slowly-varying ﬁeld. The derived Keldysh
Green’s function describes the non-equilibium state of the
Weyl fermion driven by the magnetization ﬁeld, and enables
us to study systematically the transport phenomena of the
Weyl fermion.

For the electric charge density, it is described as the re-
sponse to the emergent magnetic ﬁeld whereas the electric
current densities as those to the emergent electric ﬁelds with
showing the quantized anomalous Hall effects. The spin den-
sitites of the in-plane components can also be described as the
responses to the emergent electric ﬁeld since they are identi-
ﬁed with the electric current densitites. The electric charge
and current (spin) densities are induced by the in-plane mag-
netization ﬁelds.

The ﬁrst order response of the energy density vanishes,
while the energy current is the circular current ﬂowing within
the system. They are represented by the spatial derivative of
the z component of the magnetization ﬁeld.

Our main result is the Keldysh Green’s function in Eq. (8).
While the electric charge density, current, and spin density are
represented by the emergent electromagnetic ﬁeld as already
discussed in Ref. [20], there may be other physical properties
described directly by the above Green’s function, e.g., photon-
emisison spectroscopy in non-equilibrium state.

We present the details of the Wigner transformation and de-

rive the Keldysh Green’s function (8).
