The Kn+5 and K32,1n families are obstructions to n-apex.

Thomas W. Mattman and Mike Pierce

Abstract. We give evidence in support of a conjecture that the Y∇Y families
of Kn+5 and K32,1n are minor minimal obstructions for the n-apex property

Introduction

A graph is n-apex if deleting n or fewer vertices results in a planar graph.
Kuratowski [K] showed the 0-apex or planar graphs are characterized by the ob-
struction set O0 = {K5, K3,3}. Using the formulation of Wagner [W], a graph is
planar if and only if it has neither K5 nor K3,3 as a minor. Recall that H is a minor
of the graph G if H can be obtained by contracting edges in a subgraph of G. As
the n-apex property is minor closed, it follows from the Graph Minor Theorem of
Robertson and Seymour [RS] that there is a corresponding ﬁnite obstruction set
On. For each n, On is the set of graphs that are not n-apex even though every
proper minor is. We say that the elements of On are minor minimal not n-apex
or MMNnA.
Determining this obstruction set is likely to be quite diﬃcult. It’s known that,
already, |O1| > 150 [P], and we expect that |On| grows quickly in size with n. In
the current paper we report on computer searches that show |O2| ≥ 82, |O3| ≥ 601,
|O4| ≥ 520, and |O5| ≥ 608.

We obtain these bounds on the size of On using the Y∇Y families of Kn+5,
the complete graph on n + 5 vertices, and K32,1n, the complete multi-partite graph

with two parts of three vertices and a further n parts that each have a single vertex.
As in Figure 1, we perform a ∇Y or triangle-Y move on a graph by deleting the
edges of a triangle abc and then adding a vertex v and edges av, bv, and cv. The
reverse operation is a Y∇ or Y-triangle move. The set of graphs obtained from
a graph G through a sequence of zero or more ∇Y or Y∇ moves is G’s (Y∇Y)
family.

In this paper we provide evidence in support of the following conjecture.
Conjecture 1. For each n > 0, the Kn+5 and K32,1n families are in On.
When n = 0, there are 49 graphs in the K5 family and 10 in K3,3’s. However,
O0 = {K5, K3,3} as proved by Weber [W] and the analogue of the conjecture does
not hold in this case. On the other hand, a proof for n ≤ 2 follows easily from
earlier work.

Proposition 2. The conjecture holds for n ≤ 2.
Proof. For n = 1, the K6 and K3,3,1 families coincide. This collection of
seven graphs is known as the Petersen family since it also includes the Petersen
graph. Barsotti and Mattman [BM] observed that this family is in O1 on the way
to proving that the K7 family is in O2. In fact, they showed that the K7 family is
exactly the set of graphs in O2 of size 21 or less.
It remains to show that K32,12 is in O2. In [GMN], Goldberg, Mattman, and
Naimi show that the 58 graphs in this family are all minor minimal intrinsically
knotted or MMIK. This implies they are not 2-apex, see [BBFFHL, OT]. Since
K7 and its 13 descendants are also MMIK [KS], this means that none of these 14
graphs can be a minor of a K32,12 family graph.
So far, we have established that each of the size 22 graphs in the K32,12 family
is not 2-apex. If one of these were not in O2, then it would have to have a 2-apex
minor of size at most 21. By [BM], this minor would lie in the K7 family. We’ve
already argued that 14 of the 20 graphs in that family cannot play this role. We
omit the straightforward veriﬁcation that none of the remaining six graphs in the
(cid:3)
K7 family is a minor of a member of the K32,12 family.

We verify the conjecture for n = 3 with the aid of a computer, as described
in Section 2 below. For n = 4, we checked that the 163 graphs in the K9 family
and 357 of the graphs in the K32,14 family (all those within four ∇Y or Y∇ moves
of K32,14) are in O4. For n = 5, the computer assures us that 608 of the 1681
graphs in K10’s family are in O5. This gives the bounds for O4 and O5 mentioned
earlier. Due to time constraints, we did not attempt to check more graphs in the
K10 family nor in the K32,14 family of more than 13 thousand graphs.
It is straightforward to see that Kn+5 and K32,1n themselves are in On. We
also verify this for the three immediate descendants of each of these two graphs in
the following theorem, which we prove in Section 1. Recall that when a sequence
of ∇Y moves take us from G1 to G2, we say G2 is a descendant of G1.

Theorem 3. Let n > 0. The graphs Kn+5 and K32,1n and the three immediate

descendants of each are elements of On

It would be tempting to argue that ∇Y and Y∇ moves preserve the MMNnA
property that characterizes On. Unfortunately, this is not true in general. For
example, the disjoint unions G3 = (cid:116)n+1
i=1 K5 are both MMNnA.

i=1 K3,3 and G5 = (cid:116)n+1

THE Kn+5 AND K32,1n FAMILIES ARE OBSTRUCTIONS TO n-APEX.

However, a Y∇ move on K3,3 results in a planar graph and, similarly, a Y∇ move
on G3 gives a graph that is not in On. On the other hand, a ∇Y move on K5
results in a graph that is nonplanar, but with proper K3,3 minor. So, the child of
G5 cannot join it in On.
On the other hand, it’s easy to see that Y∇ moves preserve planarity (or,
equivalently, ∇Y preserves nonplanarity). If G is planar, and a Y∇ move on the
degree 3 vertex v results in G(cid:48) (We call this a Y∇ move at v.) then, ﬁxing a
planar embedding of G, we can eﬀect the Y∇ move in a tubular neighborhood of v
and its three edges to give a planar embedding of G(cid:48).
Using this idea we can show that a Y∇ move at v preserves the n-apex property
provided v is not an apex. For 1-apex graphs, this observation is due to Barsotti
in unpublished work. For W ⊂ V (G), let G − W denote the induced subgraph on
V (G) \ W .

Lemma 4. Suppose G is n-apex with subset U of V (G) such that |U| ≤ n and
G − U is planar. If G(cid:48) is obtained from G by a Y∇ move at the vertex v (cid:54)∈ U then
G(cid:48) is also n-apex.

Proof. The key observation is that the Y∇ move preserves planarity so that
G(cid:48) − U is again planar and G(cid:48) is |U|-apex. The details depend on how many of v’s
neighbors, a, b, and c, are in U .
If none are, the argument is the same as above: we can eﬀect the Y∇ move in
a tubular neighborhood of v and its edges. If exactly one is, say a ∈ U , then the
Y∇ move replaces the edges vb and vc in G− U with the edge bc in G(cid:48) − U so that
planarity is preserved. Similarly, if two or all three neighbors are in U , the Y∇
move will leave G(cid:48) − U planar.
(cid:3)
Although Y∇ and ∇Y moves do not preserve MMNnA in general, our conjec-
ture asserts that they do in the Kn+5 and K32,1n family.
We describe results for O2 and O3 in Section 2. This includes classiﬁcations of
all the graphs in O2 through order 9 and size 23. We also give a proof “by hand”
that the 32 graphs in the K8 family are in O3. This, with the computer veriﬁcation
for the K32,13 family, shows that our conjecture holds for n = 3. But ﬁrst we prove
Theorem 3 in the next section.

1. Proof of Theorem 3

In this section we prove that Kn+5, K32,1n , and their three immediate descen-
dants are in On. In the introduction, we gave the proof for n ≤ 2, so we will assume
n ≥ 3. Then, the three descendants of K32,1n are its children, the graphs obtained
by a single ∇Y move. The graph Kn+5 has a single child, C1, which in turn has two
children. This child and pair of grandchildren are the three immediate descendants
of Kn+5 referred to in the statement of Theorem 3.

We begin with a lemma that will be useful for one of the children of K32,1n and

which gives the ﬂavor of our approach.

Lemma 5. Let D(cid:48)(cid:48)

D(cid:48)
3 the induced subgraph on V (D(cid:48)(cid:48)

3 denote the complement of the (12, 17) graph of Figure 2 and

3 ) \ {v10, v11}. Then D(cid:48)

3 ∈ O3 and D(cid:48)(cid:48)

3 ∈ O5.

Since D(cid:48)

3 is a child of K32,13 and D(cid:48)(cid:48)

3 is a child of K32,15 , the lemma is consistent

with our conjecture.

Proof. We argue D(cid:48)

3 is not 3-apex by showing how deleting any three vertices
3 − v0 = K33, which is not 2-
results in a nonplanar graph. Deleting v0 yields D(cid:48)
apex. So we can assume that v0 is not among the three deleted vertices. On the
other hand, if none of {v7, v8, v9} are deleted, then a K3,3 subgraph remains after
deleting three vertices from {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6}. Yet, if {v7, v8, v9} are the three
deleted vertices, again a K3,3 subgraph remains. So, we are left with the cases
where exactly one or two vertices in {v7, v8, v9} is deleted.

To show that D(cid:48)

Suppose then that v9 is not deleted. Since we are assuming v0 is also not
deleted, we can contract v0v9. Then, deleting v7 leaves the graph K32,12, which is
not 2-apex. This completes the argument that D(cid:48)
3 is minor minimal not 3-apex, we argue that for any e ∈ E(D(cid:48)
3),
both deletion, D(cid:48)
3/e, of that edge gives a 3-apex graph.
Up to symmetry there are three types of edges: v0v7, v1v4, v1v7. In each case, we
list three vertices in an apex set.

For example, when e = v0v7, D(cid:48)

3 − e becomes planar on deletion of vertices v1,

v0 and v7. This complete the proof that D(cid:48)
3 is similar and we make use of what was proved for the
subgraph D(cid:48)
3 leaves a nonplanar
graph. If both v10 and v11 are among the ﬁve, this is true as deleting those two
gives D(cid:48)
3, which is not 3-apex as we just showed. This leaves two cases: either
exactly one or else neither of v10 and v11 is deleted.
If neither is deleted, note that those two together with one vertex each from
{v1, v2, v3}, {v4, v5, v6}, and {v7, v8, v9} induce a K5 subgraph. So, we can assume
that one of those triples is entirely deleted. For example, say the ﬁve deleted
vertices include {v1, v2, v3}. Then at most two of {v7, v8, v9} are deleted. Say v7
is not. Contracting v0v7 gives a subgraph of K32,12 which is not 2-apex. Suppose
instead that {v7, v8, v9} is included among the ﬁve deleted vertices. If v0 is also
deleted, what remains is K32,12, which not only fails to be 1-apex (which is all that

THE Kn+5 AND K32,1n FAMILIES ARE OBSTRUCTIONS TO n-APEX.

is required for our argument), but is in fact not 2-apex. If v0 is not among the
deleted vertices, then, up to symmetry, there are only two ways to choose the last
two vertices to delete: either {v1, v2} or {v1, v4}. In either case, a nonplanar graph
results.

To complete the argument that D(cid:48)(cid:48)

3 is not 5-apex, suppose that exactly one of
v10 and v11 is deleted, say v11. If we, in addition, delete v0, what remains is a K33,1
graph. There are then three vertices left to delete, and if any pair are in the same
part of K33,1, after deleting that pair, we have the not 1-apex graph K32,1 as a
subgraph and a nonplanar graph on deleting the ﬁfth and ﬁnal vertex. So, we can
assume that the remaining three deleted vertices are taken one each from diﬀerent
parts of K33,1. For example, we could delete v1, v4, and v7. This leaves a nonplanar
graph.

This means we can assume v0 is not among the ﬁve deleted vertices, still under
If v1 and v2 are deleted, the

remaining graph has a K32,12 subgraph and is not 2-apex. Using the symmetry of
the graph, this means we can assume v7 and v8 are deleted instead. However, this
again results in a graph that is not 2-apex by virtue of having a K32,12 subgraph.
This completes the argument that D(cid:48)(cid:48)

We next demonstrate that, for any edge e, both D(cid:48)(cid:48)

3 /e are 5-apex.
If e is not incident on v10 or v11, we may delete those two vertices and recognize e
3 − e and
as an edge in D(cid:48)
3. As we have already found three vertex apex sets for D(cid:48)
3 − e or
3/e, taking the union with {v10, v11} gives a ﬁve vertex apex set for D(cid:48)(cid:48)
D(cid:48)
D(cid:48)(cid:48)
3 /e.

3 − e and D(cid:48)(cid:48)

3 is not 5–apex.

So, we may assume that e is incident on v10, v11 or both. Up to symmetry,

there are three such edges, and, in each case, we provide a ﬁve vertex apex set.

Edge e

v7v10 D(cid:48)(cid:48)
v10v11 D(cid:48)(cid:48)

3 /e: v1, v2, v3, v4, v8
3 /e: v1, v2, v3, v4, v7

3 ∈ O5.

This completes the proof that D(cid:48)(cid:48)
Proof. (of Theorem 3) We begin with Kn+5, which is not n-apex since deletion
of any n vertices gives the nonplanar graph K5. On the other hand, given e ∈
E(Kn+5), both deletion and contraction of e result in an n-apex graph as can be
seen by deleting any n vertices not on the edge e. Therefore, every proper minor
of Kn+5 is n-apex and Kn+5 ∈ On.

(cid:3)

Let C1 denote the child of Kn+5. This graph has a unique vertex, v0, of degree

three with neighbors v1, v2, and v3. Denote the remaining vertices v4, v5, v6, . . . , vn+5.
Generally, deleting n vertices results in a graph with K3,3 minor. The exception is
when exactly one of v1, v2, and v3 is deleted and v0 is not. In this case, the result
has a K5 minor. Thus, C1 is not n-apex.
Up to symmetry, there are three types of edges in C1, represented by v0v1,
v1v4, and v4v5. For each choice of edge, e, we argue that both deletion, C1 − e, and
contraction, C1/e, gives an n-apex graph.

For C1/e, we observe that, no matter which edge is contracted, by appropriate
deletion of n vertices, we can ensure that v0 (or the vertex formed by identifying v0

6

THOMAS W. MATTMAN AND MIKE PIERCE

and v1 in case e = v0v1) is an isolated vertex in the resulting graph on 5 vertices,
which is, therefore, nonplanar. If e = v0v1 or v1v4, C1 − e is planar after deleting
all vertices but v0 through v6, while C1 − v4v5 becomes planar after deletion of at
least one of v1, v2, v3 and none of v0, v4, v5.
Therefore C1 ∈ On and we turn to its children. To form a triangle in C1, we
use at most one vertex from v1, v2, and v3. This means a triangle cannot include
v0 and, up to symmetry, there are two types of triangles: v1v4v5, resulting in the
child C2, or v4v5v6, which gives a child we’ll call C3. For these new graphs, we’ll
use the same vertex labels as in C1 with the addition of a new degree three vertex
w0.
Let’s see why C2 ∈ On. First, notice that there is a graph automorphism by
interchanging v0 and w0 and the pair {v2, v3} with {v4, v5}. Deleting n− 2 of the n
vertices in {v6, v7, . . . vn+5} results in a graph in the K7 family, that is not 2-apex
by Proposition 2. The only way C2 could remain planar after deletion of n vertices
is if at least three of those vertices remain. However the remaining vertices from
that set, together with up to one each of {v2, v3} and {v4, v5}, form a clique. A
clique on ﬁve or more vertices contains K5 and is nonplanar. Thus, we surely have
a nonplanar subgraph by deletion of n vertices except, possibly, in two cases (up to
symmetry): 1) {v6, v7, v8, v9} remain after deleting the n vertices, or 2) {v6, v7, v8}
and vertices from at most one of {v2, v3} and {v4, v5}, say the ﬁrst, remain.
In the ﬁrst case, we see that {v2, v3, v4, v5, v10, v11, . . . vn+5} are the n deleted
vertices and what remains is the graph induced on v0, v1, v6, v7, v8, v9, and w0,
which is nonplanar.
In the second case, we can assume v2 remains as otherwise we must have deleted
the n + 1 vertices {v2, v3, v4, v5, v9, v10, . . . , vn+5}. Since v2 remains, we see that
{v4, v5, v9, v10, . . . , vn+5} are n−1 of the deleted vertices. The graph H that remains
after deleting these is the induced graph on the eight vertices v0, v1, v2, v3, v6, v7,
v8, and w0. It is straightforward to verify that H is not 1-apex. So, no matter
which vertex is chosen as the nth for deletion, the result will be nonplanar in this
case. This completes the argument that C2 is not n-apex.
Next we show that every proper minor is n-apex by establishing this for C2 − e
and C2/e whatever edge e is chosen. Up to symmetry, there are six choices for
e: v0v1, v0v2, v1v6, v2v4, v2v6, and v6v7. Recall that deleting n − 2 vertices from
{v6, v7, . . . , vn+5} converts C2 to a graph C(cid:48)
2 in the K7 family. Each choice of e
corresponds to an edge in C(cid:48)
2 and we’ve already established, in Proposition 2, that
2−e and C(cid:48)
C(cid:48)
2/e are 2-apex. This means the corresponding minors of C2 are n-apex.
This completes the argument that C2 ∈ On.
Let’s see why C3 is not n-apex. Deleting n−2 vertices in V7+ = {v7, v8, . . . , vn+5}
results in a graph in the K7 family that is not 2-apex by Proposition 2. So, to
achieve a planar graph after deleting n vertices would require at least two vertices
in V7+ to remain. On the other hand the vertices in V7+ induce a clique so, to
avoid the nonplanar K5, at most four can remain. Up to symmetry, this gives three
cases: 1) {v7, v8, v9, v10}, 2) {v7, v8, v9}, or 3) {v7, v8} are the elements that remain
after deleting n–vertices. To complete the argument that C3 is not n-apex, we’ll
show that none of these lead to a planar graph.
Any vertex from {v1, v2, v3} or {v4, v5, v6} will also induce a clique with vertices
from V7+. In the ﬁrst case, if we are to avoid a nonplanar graph, we must delete the
n+1 vertices {v1, v2, . . . v6, v11, v12, . . . , vn+5}, so we cannot use this case to show C3

THE Kn+5 AND K32,1n FAMILIES ARE OBSTRUCTIONS TO n-APEX.

is n-apex. In the second case, we could have vertices from at most one of {v1, v2, v3}
and {v4, v5, v6}, say the ﬁrst, in addition to {v7, v8, v9}. This means we have
{v4, v5, v6, v10, v11, . . . , vn+5} as n − 1 of the deleted vertices. It’s straightforward
to verify that the graph induced on the other vertices, v0, v1, v2, v3, v7, v8, v9, w0 is
not 1-apex. For the ﬁnal case, {v9, v10, . . . , vn+5} are n − 3 of the deleted vertices.
The graph induced on the other vertices, v0, v1, . . . v8, w0 is not 3-apex. Thus, in
any case, we deduce that C3 is not n-apex.
Up to symmetry, there are four types of edges in C3: v0v1, v1v4, v1v7, and
v7v8. By deleting n − 2 vertices in {v7, v8, . . . , vn+5} we arrive at the graph C(cid:48)
3
in the K7 family. Aside from v7v8, each choice of edge e is represented in C(cid:48)
3. In
3/e are 2-apex, which means C3 − e
Proposition 2 we argued that C(cid:48)
and C3/e are n-apex. When e = v7v8, we can think of deleting the n − 3 vertices
{v9, v10, . . . , vn+5} to give the graph H induced on the vertices v0, v1, . . . v8, w0, a
graph in the K8 family. Now, deleting vertices v1, v2, v4 shows that H − v7v8 is
3-apex while deleting vertices v1, v2, v3 demonstrates that H/v7v8 is also 3-apex.
It follows that deleting or contracting v7v8 in C3 results in an n-apex graph. Since
any C3 − e or C3/e is n-apex, it follows that any proper minor is n-apex. This
completes the argument that C3 ∈ On.

3 − e and C(cid:48)

The graph K32,1n is not n-apex as deleting any n vertices leaves a graph with
K3,3 minor. Let v1, v2, v3 and v4, v5, v6 denote the vertices in the two parts with
three vertices and v7, v8, . . . vn+6 the vertices in the remaining n parts. Up to
symmetry, there are three types of edges e: v1v4, v1v7, and v7v8. Removing n
vertices from K32,1n /e gives a graph on ﬁve vertices which is planar as long as it
is not K5. For example, ensuring that v5 and v6 are among the ﬁve vertices that
remain shows that K32,1n /e is n-apex. On the other hand, deleting n vertices from
K32,1n − e gives a graph on six vertices. For each choice of e, we list six vertices
that induce a planar subgraph: for e = v1v4, use v1, v2, . . . , v6; if e = v1v7, take
v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v7; and when e = v7v8, then v1, v2, v4, v5, v7, v8 will work. This
shows that any proper minor of K32,1n is n-apex and completes the proof that it is
in On.
Up to symmetry, there are three types of triangles in K32,1n. We’ll call the
three children D1, D2, and D3, corresponding to ∇Y moves on on v1v4v7, v1v7v8,
and v7v8v9 respectively. We’ll argue each child is in On. In Di, we preserve the
vertex labels v1, v2, . . . , vn+6 from K32,1n and call the new vertex of degree three
v0.
In D1, deleting n − 2 vertices from V8+ = {v8, v9, . . . , vn+6} gives a graph,
D(cid:48)
1, in the K31,12 family that is not 2-apex by Proposition 2. So, at least two
vertices from V8+ must remain. On the other hand, vertices in V8+ induce a clique
so at most four can remain and we again have three cases: 1) {v8, v9, v10, v11}, 2)
{v8, v9, v10}, and 3) {v8, v9} are the vertices of V8+ that remain.
In addition, up to one vertex each from {v2, v3} and {v5, v6} can be added to
those remaining from V8+ to make a clique. So, in the ﬁrst case, we can assume that
n− 1 vertices were deleted leaving the graph induced on v0, v1, v4, v7, v8, v9, v10, v11,
let’s say that vertices from {v2, v3}
which is not 1-apex.
may remain. Then, after deleting n − 2 vertices, we have the graph induced on
v0, v1, v2, v3, v4, v7, v8, v9, v10, which is not 2-apex. Finally, in the third case, after
deleting n − 3 vertices, we have the graph induced on v0, v1, . . . , v9, which is not
3-apex. This shows that D1 is not n-apex.

In the second case,

Up to symmetry there are nine types of edges in D1: v0v1, v0v7, v1v5, v1v8, v2v5,

1, a graph in the K32,12 family obtained by deleting n− 2 vertices from V8+. In
in D(cid:48)
1/e are 2-apex and it follows that D1−e
Proposition 2, we argued that D(cid:48)
and D1/e are n-apex when e (cid:54)= v8v9. If we delete n − 3 vertices in V8+, leaving
{v8, v9}, we obtain the graph H induced on v0, v1, . . . , v9, which includes the edge
v7v8. Deleting v1, v4, v7 shows that H − v8v9 is 3-apex and D1− v8v9 is n-apex. For
H/v8v9, deletion of v1, v2, v3 shows that it it 3-apex and D1/v8v9 is n-apex. We’ve
shown that for any edge e, D1 − e and D1/e are both n-apex. It follows that any
proper minor is n-apex, which completes the argument that D1 ∈ On.
The veriﬁcation for D2 is similar and we’ll omit some details. Deleting the n−2
vertices in V9+ results in the graph D(cid:48)
2 in the K32,12 family, which is not 2-apex.
This leaves the cases where between four and one vertex of V9+ remain. Since one
vertex each from {v2, v3}, {v4, v5, v6}, and {v7, v8} can join with vertices of V9+ to
form a clique, some or all of these must be deleted to avoid K5, a clique on ﬁve
vertices, surviving. For example, in the case that four vertices of V9+ remain, then
all seven vertices v2, v3 . . . v8 must be deleted in addition to the n − 6 taken from
V9+, which is a total of n + 1 vertices. In the case that only one vertex of V9+
remains, we have removed n − 3 vertices from V9+ and argue that the graph that
remains, on ten vertices, is not 3-apex. The remaining cases can be approached in
the same way; remove either n − 4 or n − 5 vertices from V9+ and argue that the
remaining graphs are not 4-apex nor 5-apex. This shows D2 is not n-apex.
There are several edge types in D2, but with the exception of those incident
on vertices in V9+, all are represented in D(cid:48)
2. For edges e incident on one or two
vertices of V9+, we argue directly that the graphs that remain after deleting n − 3
or n − 4 vertices of V9+ and either contracting or deleting e are 3-apex or 4-apex,
respectively. This implies that the corresponding graph D2 − e or D2/e is n-apex,
as required.
D(cid:48)
3, this time in the K32,13 family, In Lemma 5 we proved D(cid:48)
n− 3 vertices in V10+ gives D(cid:48)
cases where between one and four vertices of V10+ remain.

Finally, we turn to D3. As with earlier cases, we will leverage a similar graph
3 ∈ O3. Deleting the
3, so to prove D3 is not n-apex it remains to take the
Taking a vertex each from {v1, v2, v3}, {v4, v5, v6}, and {v7, v8, v9} gives a clique
with any vertices that remain from V10+. In case four vertices from V10+ remain,
this means deletion of a further nine vertices in addition to the n − 7 from V10+ to
avoid a K5 minor and so cannot be used to show D3 is n-apex. Suppose the three
vertices {v10, v11, v12} remain from V10+. To avoid a K5 minor, we must delete
two of the triples and there are a couple of ways to do this. If {v1, v2, . . . , v6} are
deleted, then n vertices are gone and we observe that the resulting graph induced on
v0, v7, v8, . . . , v12 is nonplanar. On the other hand, if {v4, v5, . . . , v9} are deleted, the
result, induced on v0, v1, v2, v3, v10, v11, v12 is again nonplanar. So, we can assume
at most two vertices from V10+ remain. If two, we’ve deleted n− 5 vertices to leave
3 ∈ O5 (see Lemma 5) and if only one, what’s left is a graph in the
the graph D(cid:48)(cid:48)
K32,16 family that can be shown to be not 6-apex. This completes the argument
that D3 is not n-apex.

2. Results for O2 and O3

In this section we prove Conjecture 1 when n = 3. However, we begin with clas-
siﬁcations of the graphs in O2 through order nine and size 23. Mattman [M] estab-
lished that the elements of O2 have size 21 at least and Barsotti and Mattman [BM]
showed that the K7 family is precisely the set of graphs of size 21. The 58 K32,12
graphs are of size 22 in O2 and, based on a computer search, we have found exactly
two other graphs with 22 edges. Both are 4–regular on 11 vertices and we list their
edges below.

{{1, 6},{1, 9},{1, 10},{1, 11},{2, 6},{2, 9},{2, 10},{2, 11},

{3, 7},{3, 8},{3, 9},{3, 10},{4, 7},{4, 8},{4, 9},
{4, 11},{5, 7},{5, 8},{5, 10},{5, 11},{6, 7},{6, 8}}

{{1, 5},{1, 6},{1, 7},{1, 8},{2, 6},{2, 7},{2, 8},{2, 9},

{3, 7},{3, 8},{3, 9},{3, 10},{4, 8},{4, 9},{4, 10},

{4, 11},{5, 9},{5, 10},{5, 11},{6, 10},{6, 11},{7, 11}}

We were surprised to discover that there are no graphs in O2 of size 23. This is
similar to O1 where the Petersen family graphs of size 15 are the only obstructions
with fewer than 18 edges (see [BM]). On the other hand, we do have examples of
graphs in O2 for each size between 24 and 30, inclusive.
In terms of order, we found a total of 12 graphs in O2 with nine or fewer
vertices. There are ﬁve each in the K7 and K32,12 families and two of size 26 and
27 whose edge lists we give below.

{{1, 4},{1, 5},{1, 7},{1, 8},{1, 9},{2, 5},{2, 6},{2, 7},{2, 8},
{2, 9},{3, 5},{3, 6},{3, 7},{3, 8},{3, 9},{4, 6},{4, 7},{4, 8},

{4, 9},{5, 6},{5, 8},{5, 9},{6, 8},{6, 9},{7, 8},{7, 9}}

{{1, 4},{1, 5},{1, 6},{1, 7},{1, 8},{1, 9},{2, 4},{2, 5},{2, 6},
{2, 7},{2, 8},{2, 9},{3, 4},{3, 5},{3, 6},{3, 7},{3, 8},{3, 9},
{4, 6},{4, 7},{4, 8},{5, 7},{5, 8},{5, 9},{6, 8},{6, 9},{7, 9}}

In total, this gives 82 graphs in O2: 20 in the K7 family, 58 in K32,12’s, and four
more with edges listed above.

Next, we show that Conjecture 1 holds for n = 3. For this we rely on a
computer veriﬁcation that the 569 graphs in the K32,13 family are MMN3A. Then
the following theorem completes the proof. Together with the K32,13 family, the 32
graphs in K8’s give the bound O3 ≥ 601 mentioned in the introduction.

Theorem 6. The K8 family is in O3.
Proof. The K8 family consists of 32 graphs, illustrated schematically in Fig-
ure 3. In the appendix we give edge lists for these graphs. Graphs at the same
height are of the same order and edges join graphs that are related by a ∇Y move.
All graphs in this family have 28 edges. The numbering simply reﬂects the order in
which these graphs were generated by our computer program and we refer to the
graphs in the family as Cousin 1, K8, through Cousin 32, a graph of order 16.

Figure 3. The K8 family.

Theorem 3 shows that Cousin 1, K8, and its child, Cousin 2, and grandchildren,
Cousins 3 and 4, are all MMN3A. We apply Lemma 4 to see that the remaining
descendants of K8 are not 3-apex.
For example, let C5 denote Cousin 5, which is a child of Cousin 3, C3. In other
words a Y∇ move at some vertex v in C5 gives C3. If C5 were 3-apex and v not
an apex, then Lemma 4 would imply C3 is 3-apex, a contradiction. So, to show
that C5 is not 3-apex, it is enough to argue that v cannot be an apex. For this, it
suﬃces to show that C5 − v is not 2-apex. Indeed, C3 can be obtained by a Y∇
move at vertex v = 9. Deleting edges {4, 6}, {4, 8}, and {6, 8} from C5−9 results in
a graph (Cousin 4 by the numbering in [GMN]) in the K32,12 family. This shows
that C5 − 9 is not 2-apex, as required.
In the appendix, we list, for each cousin Cn (5 ≤ n ≤ 32) in the K8 family, a
vertex v such that a Y∇ move at v gives another graph in the family, and edges of
Cn such that deleting or contracting those edges from Cn − v gives a graph in the
K32,12 family. In fact, we can take v = 9 in all cases. This shows no graphs in the
family are 3-apex.
Further, for 5 ≤ n ≤ 32, we show that each proper minor of Cn is 3-apex. For
each edge e (up to symmetry), we show that both Cn − e and Cn/e (edge deletion

11

and contraction, respectively) are 3-apex by listing three vertices whose deletion
(cid:3)
gives a planar subgraph. This completes the proof.

Appendix A. Edge lists of K8 family graphs

In Tables 1 and 2 we list the edges of the 32 graphs in the K8 family. We

number the graphs as Cousin 1 (K8) through Cousin 32 (a graph of order 16).

Appendix B. K8 family graphs are not 3-apex

For each cousin Cn (5 ≤ n ≤ 32) in the K8 family, a Y∇ move at vertex 9
results in another graph in that family. We can show Cn is not 3-apex by arguing
that Cn − 9 is not 2-apex. For this we list, in Table 3, edges that are to be deleted
or contracted in Cn − 9 to produce a minor which is a cousin in the K32,12 family.
Cousins in that family are numbered as in [GMN]
For example, deleting edges {{4, 6},{4, 8},{6, 8}} of C5 − 9 results in cousin 4
of the K32,12 family. In the case of C8 − 9, ﬁrst delete edges {4, 6} and {4, 8} and
then contract edge {8, 11} to realize cousin 2 of the K32,12 family.

Appendix C. Proper minors are 3-apex

For each cousin Cn (5 ≤ n ≤ 32) in the K8 family, each proper minor of Cn is 3-
apex. We show this in Tables 4–10 by considering each edge e of Cn (distinct up to
symmetry) and for the graphs Cn−e and Cn/e (edge deletion and edge contraction,
respectively) listing three vertices whose deletion gives a planar subgraph.

In Tables 4–10 we use the convention that the vertex that is the result of an
edge contraction adopts the name of the smaller of the two vertex names on the
edge that was contracted. For example if we were to contract the edge {1, 8}, the
new resulting vertex would be referred to as vertex 1.
