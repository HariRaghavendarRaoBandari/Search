In a common paradigm, the electronic structure of condensed matter is divided into weakly and
strongly correlated compounds. While conventional band theory usually works well for the former
class, many-body eﬀects are essential for the latter. Materials like the familiar SrTiO3 compound
that bridge or even abandon this characterization scheme are highly interesting. Here it is shown
by means of combining density functional theory with dynamical-mean ﬁeld theory that oxygen
vacancies on the STO (001) surface give rise to a dichotomy of weakly-correlated t2g low-energy
quasiparticles and localized ’in-gap’ states of dominant eg character with subtle correlation signature.
We furthermore touch base with recent experimental work and study the surface instability towards
magnetic order.

The SrTiO3 (STO) compound has long been known for
its paraelectric [1], semiconducting [2] and superconduct-
ing properties [3]. Renewed interest is fostered by the
ﬁndings of a conducting two-dimensional electron system
(2DES) on the STO surface [4, 5], of intricate magnetic
response [6], as well as due to its intriguing role as a
prominent building block in novel oxide heterostructures
([7, 8], see e.g. [9, 10] reviews). In this respect, several
experiments [4, 5, 11–13] point towards the importance
of oxygen vacancies for the plethora of physics emerging
from the inconspicuous bulk band insulator.

Stoichiometric strontium titanate is rather unsuscep-
tible to electronic correlations due to nominal Ti4+(3d0)
valence. However, doping transforms STO into a ma-
terial with potential for salient signatures of correlation
eﬀects. Usually the competition between electron local-
ization and itinerancy in materials can be traced back to
the interacting many-body system at stoichiometry. In
doped STO, in contrast, defects have to build up the gen-
eral correlated electronic structure from localized states
aﬀecting the low-energy quasiparticle (QP) nature be-
yond a conventional Anderson-model perspective.

The orbital character, ﬁlling, correlation strength and
mobility of the key electronic states in doped STO is of
main interest. In principle, electron doping as introduced
by oxygen vacancies could ﬁll the empty Ti-3d(t2g) states
at low energy. However creating an oxygen vacancy (OV)
breaks the bond between Ti-3d(eg) and O-2p. It has been
shown [14–21] that as a result also 3d(eg) spectral weight
appears just below the Fermi level εF of the established
metallic state. Investigations based on density functional
theory (DFT) identify this eg weight as associated with
an ’in-gap’ level due to the vacancy-induced crystal-ﬁeld
lowering. Depending on the local structural deformation,
Ti charging, vacancy concentration and energy distance
to εF, that spectral feature may also be interpreted as a
small polaron. The latter is here deﬁned by the localiza-
tion of one electron at an isolated Ti site, i.e.
forming

Ti3+, with sizable distortion of the surrounding oxygen
octahedron and binding energy ∼ −1eV [22]. Recent
DFT+ Hubbard U calculations for the TiO2 rutile and
anatase surface reveal that local Coulomb interactions
are relevant for small-polaron formation [23].

The STO surface is readily made accessible to the cre-
ation of OVs, e.g. via in-situ crystal fracture [4] or by
exposure to UV light [5]. Furthermore (angle-resolved)
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is ideally suited
to probe the surface electronic structure. It reveals t2g-
like low-energy bands and a prominent high-energy peak
at −1.3eV [5, 12, 13]. While the t2g-band dispersion is
well described in DFT-based methods [20, 21, 24], the
characterization of the high-energy feature is more in-
triguing. Depending on the computational setup, the
in-gap eg weight from DFT+U [20, 21] matches with
the corresponding experimental peak position below εF.
Though Kohn-Sham theory with static Hubbard-U cor-
relations provides relevant insight [20, 21], so far a clear-
cut many-body study of the interplay between high- and
low-energy electron states on the oxygen-deﬁcient STO
surface has been missing. Also in a small-polaron picture
the (orbital-dependent) role of electronic correlations, es-
pecially beyond static modelings, remains open.

In this work, we employ a combination of DFT with
dynamical mean-ﬁeld theory (DMFT) to investigate the
role of correlations due to isolated oxygen-vacancy de-
fects on the STO (001) surface. We ﬁnd that many-
body eﬀects within charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT
reveal novel features of the high-energy −1.3eV peak be-
yond the means of static correlation schemes. Localized
eg-like states with minor t2g intermixing and itinerant
states of exclusive t2g nature with strong xy polarization
coexist. An interplay of renormalized crystal ﬁelds and
ﬁnite-frequency parts of the electronic self-energies drives
this electronic dichotomy.

DFT+DMFT approach. A correlated subspace of
three eﬀective 3d orbitals on each Ti site is obtained
from the projected-local-orbital formalism [25–29] (for
details see the supplementary material). The Kohn-Sham
problem within charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT [30–
33]
is addressed by a mixed-basis pseudopotential
code [34], employing the generalized-gradient approxima-
tion (GGA). Continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo [35,
36]
is used for the coupled single-site DMFT impu-
rity problems. Local Coulomb interactions in Slater-
Kanamori form are parametrized by a Hubbard U =3.5eV
and a Hund’s coupling JH=0.5eV. The correlated elec-
tron problem is solved at β=40eV−1.

Paramagnetic electronic structure. Two OVs amount
to a vacancy concentration of c = 0.02 and electron-dope
the slab structures with four electrons, respectively. As
a general ﬁnding in line with previous work, OV-induced
localized defect states are indeed of dominant eg char-
acter. But still, both defect structures diﬀer in their
electronic characteristics, as visualized by the bonding
charge density ρb in Fig. 1.
In the SV structure, only
the surface Ti site above the OV in the SrO layer be-
low harbors an eﬀective eg level at lower energy. The
surface-layer vacancy does not allow for such states on
nearby Ti sites, but the t2g levels are somewhat modi-
ﬁed. On the other hand for the DV case, the double-OV
defect only leads to eﬀective eg on the Ti site between
the two vacancies. Hence if double-vacancy environments
are available, low-energy eg-like states are created on the
embedded Ti site, also at the cost of abandoning such
defect levels at Ti sites near single vacancies. Note that
the subsurface oxygen vacancy in the SV case also cre-
ates such a double-vacancy scenario in an eﬀective way,
since the vacuum mimics the role of the ’second vacancy’.
Table I provides the nature and the ﬁllings of the dom-
inantly occupied orbitals, i.e. those forming the in-gap
states. Be aware that these Ti-based ϕ orbitals are not
of atomic but Wannier-like kind and their ﬁlling there-
fore includes charge from the surrounding region. The

the t2g states is on average on the order of 1.3 eV. No-
tably in DFT+DMFT, in addition to the OV-introduced
eg-like ﬁllings, the t2g(yz) orbital on the embedded sur-
face Ti ion in the DV structural case becomes localized
and signiﬁcantly occupied. This may be inferred from
the conﬁnement via OVs in x-direction, i.e. along the
a-axis. Thus the true double-vacancy defect is eﬀective
in localizing additionally a t2g state through correlations.
The quasi-double-defect involving the vacuum in the SV
structure is not capable thereof.

Both surfaces are metallic in GGA and DFT+DMFT.
But the k-integrated spectral function with electronic
correlations displays signiﬁcant spectral weight trans-
fer/shift compared to GGA (see Fig. 2b,c). The total
spectral functions with correlations in Fig. 2a display for
the DV case a broadened high-energy peak at −1.1eV, i.e.
close to experimental ﬁndings [5, 11–13]. A sharper peak
at ∼ −0.5eV occurs for the SV structure. As shown in the
local analysis of Fig. 2b, these in-gap spectral weights are
mainly associated with eg-like states already appearing
on the GGA level. Electronic correlations are eﬀective in
broadening and shifting those towards higher energies.
The real part of the self-energy Σ(ω + i0+) renormalizes
the GGA crystal ﬁeld for ω = 0, while the imaginary part
introduces ﬁnite-lifetime eﬀects. Note that the DV high-
energy satellite has in addition sizable yz character from
the embedded Ti site, whereas there is no substantial
yz-orbital contribution at the associated GGA energy.

In general, standard lower-Hubbard-band interpreta-
tions are not that readily applicable. The eg-t2g hy-

bridization is weak and already small interactions shift
the eg spectral weight away from the Fermi level in the
present isolated-defect cases. Furthermore, the eg-like
ﬁlling remains with and without correlations above a
half-ﬁlled scenario (cf. Tab I). Both facts e.g. diﬀer from
a dense-defect limit of OVs in the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 in-
terface, recently studied in DFT+DMFT [19]. There,
a lower eg-like Hubbard band from Ti3+ was identiﬁed.
Here the Wannier-like 3d occupation centered on OV-
embedded Ti in the DV structure is close to integer ﬁlling
of two electrons, i.e. a local positive charging somewhat
below Ti3+ is likely. Note that Hubbard-like signatures
may indeed be attributed to the yz spectral contribution.

Interestingly,

At the Fermi level, correlations are eﬀective in sup-
pressing the eg character from GGA (cf. Fig 2b,c). Thus
a clear dichotomy of only-localized and only-itinerant
electrons sets in.
for both structural
cases the surface TiO2 layer appears least conductive
in DFT+DMFT. For the single-vacancy case the second
transition-metal oxide layer contributes most to trans-
port, while in the DV structure an equal share between
the subsurface layers takes place. Moreover the t2g-like
QPs close to the Fermi level become strongly xy polar-
ized with correlations beyond GGA. Note that due to
the small doping, strong QP renormalization remains ab-
sent. The width ∆t2g∼0.25eV of this low-energy manifold
agrees well with recent ARPES data [37, 38].

Ferromagnetic electronic structure. Spin-splitted t2g-
derived low-energy bands have been observed in the
2DES on the STO surface [37, 38]. Additionally, op-

tically induced magnetism has been directly reported
for oxygen-deﬁcient STO [6].
In a previous DFT+U
work [21] we showed that magnetism and Rashba eﬀects
compete at the doped-STO surface and that the in-gap eg
states acquire large magnetic moments. Here we study
correlation eﬀects in the ferromagnetic (FM) state be-
yond DFT+U [39]. When we allow for net spin polariza-
tion, the double-vacancy defect structure reveals a FM
moment. No magnetic order is stabilized in the SV case.
The DV magnetism is of strong local kind and spin split-
ting occurs mainly at the embedded Ti site (see Fig. 3a).
The ordered local moment amounts to 0.22µB, whereby
the ϕ(1)(ϕ(3)) orbital carries 0.14(0.08)µB.
In our pre-
vious static DFT+U study for the same structure [21],
larger local moments up to 0.9µB were revealed. Thus
quantum ﬂuctuations and ﬁnite temperature are eﬀec-
tive in reducing the ordered moment. Figure 3a shows
that in the DV surface layer, the NN oxygens and the
OV-adjacent Ti sites counteract the embedded moment
with minor antiferromagnetic alignment.

The total spectral

information in Fig. 3b displays
strong spin splitting of about 0.25eV of the satellite peak
at −1.1eV. The small yz localized-orbital contribution
from the embedded Ti site is nearly exclusively spin-up
polarized. In contrast to some experimental data [38] and
our recent DFT+U work [21], no strong spin splitting is
detected in the low-energy t2g regime. This may be due
to the elevated temperature, speciﬁc defect structure, or
the present choice of the correlated subspace. Further
work is needed to investigate this subtle issue with the
ambitious DFT+DMFT framework in more detail.

Summary and discussion. Many-body and crystal-
ﬁeld eﬀects induced by oxygen vacancies, here described
beyond static-correlation approaches within charge self-
consistent DFT+DMFT, are responsible for an apparent
dichotomy in the electronic structure on the STO defect
surface. Double-vacancy defects in the surface TiO2 layer
give rise to surface localized eg dominated states as well
as subsurface itinerant t2g metallicity. The experimen-

4

tal −1.3eV high-energy satellite is identiﬁed as an eg-
derived in-gap level that becomes broadened, shifted and
dressed with minor Hubbard-band-like t2g(yz) weight
by a frequency-dependent self-energy. Note that this
localized-yz contribution may be unique to the speciﬁc
architecture of the chosen DV structure. The signature of
correlation is weaker in the single-vacancies defect struc-
ture, where the weakly-renormalized crystal-ﬁeld charac-
ter rules the nature of the in-gap state. A direct connec-
tion to oxygen vacancies in bulk STO seems diﬃcult at
ﬁrst sight, since there the surface symmetry breaking is
absent. But based on earlier DFT studies [14, 15] also
revealing localized eg-like states in bulk STO with such
defects, the essential qualitative physics discussed here
is believed to extend to the bulk regime. Moreover, in
the recent DFT+DMFT study for LaAlO3/SrTiO3 [19]
a similar dichotomy has been revealed.

A comment on the comparison between the DFT+U
and the DFT+DMFT approach to the problem is in or-
der The former method treating only static correlations
already provides important insight [20], also by includ-
ing the Rashba physics [21]. However DFT+U mainly
captures the renormalized crystal-ﬁeld mechanism, fully
established in that method only with symmetry break-
ing towards long-range magnetic order. This yields for
doped STO a reasonable account of especially the inte-
grated density of states. We here advance thereon by
describing a true paramagnetic phase at ﬁnite tempera-
ture, where a competition between renormalized crystal
ﬁelds and Hubbard-band-formation takes place.

The small-polaron point of view is not studied in detail,
albeit structural distortions around the OV defects gives
room for such an interpretation, especially in the SV case.
But metallic conductivity based on low-energy quasipar-
ticles sets in already for the present OV concentrations.
Moreover, the possible deviation from a clear Ti3+ charge
state, especially in the DV case, renders a direct small-
polaron picture doubtful. Yet it cannot be excluded that
polaronic transport is active in much more diluted sce-
narios. On the other hand, it is generally expected that
a further increase of the OV concentration strengthens
the Hubbard-like character of the high-energy satellite.
The correlation-induced conﬁning, here generated via the
double-vacancy defect, will then be realized more eﬀec-
tively [19, 20]. For larger numbers of OVs the eg-t2g hy-
bridization and -exchange will be such that eg-like states
participate in the low-energy transport [19, 40]. Further
study of that crossover and inclusion of other possibly
relevant ingredients such as the interplay of correlations
and spin-orbit coupling beyond DFT+U or of improved
non-local exchange-correlation treatments [41] are tasks
for future theoretical work.

DETAILS ON THE SURFACE STRUCTURES

For all calculations we utilize the STO experimen-
tal lattice constant a=3.905˚A. Periodic 3×3×4 slabs, a
vacuum-region width of 5a and TiO2 termination are
used to model the oxygen-deﬁcient STO (001) surface.
Two defect architectures with two vacant oxygen sites
and 178 remaining atomic sites, respectively, are investi-
gated. The SV structure has one oxygen vacancy in the
surface layer and the second in the SrO layer below, with
separation distance √17/2 a. The DV structure has a
double-vacancy defect in the surface layer, i.e., two OVs
in nearest-neighbor (NN) distance a. The respective 36
Ti sites in each structural case split into 16 symmetry-
inequivalent shells. Both defect-surface slabes are struc-
turally relaxed within DFT+U [1]. While surface-layer
OVs slightly repell the NN Ti ions, the subsurface va-
cancy attracts the Ti sites above and below.

DETAILS ON THE DFT+DMFT APPROACH

The correlated subspace within the present work is
build up by three eﬀective 3d orbitals on each Ti site. In
order to construct this subspace in a well-deﬁned man-
ner we start from an initial full-3d-shell ﬁve-orbital pro-
jection using 5 × 36 = 180 Kohn-Sham (KS) conduction
states. After local orthogonalization the three most rele-
vant projection functions are retained. Those are deﬁned
by having sizable occupation and/or weight just above
εF, which proves reliable to reduce the number of impor-

6

tant local Ti projections. Due to the symmetry-lowering
defect structure, the eﬀective functions are written as lin-
ear combinations of the original cubic (eg, t2g) orbitals.
Finally the three-fold projection functions on each of the
36 Ti sites yield the correlated subspace by acting on
3 × 36 = 108 conduction KS states. It is important to
realize that the resulting real-space orbitals of the cor-
related subspace are not highly localized at the Ti sites,
such as true atomic orbitals or the derived projection
functions. This due to the minimal projection of 108
localized functions onto 108 KS states, which here also
excludes explicit O-based projection functions. Hence
the DMFT self-energies are associated with Wannier-like
functions of some extent. An interpretation of physical
observables, such as the local electron ﬁlling, in terms of
atomic notions has therefore to be performed with care.
In the DFT part of the full correlated problem we
use
the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA)
in the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form [2]. Due
to symmetry, the DMFT part has to account for 16
inequivalent single-site impurity problems.
In the
interfacing of DFT with DMFT a double-counting
correction is employed. We here put the fully-localized
version [3]
The complete correlated
electronic structure is represented on a 4×4×1 k-point
mesh. The maximum-entropy method serves for the
analytical continuation from Matsubara space to retrieve
the spectral data.
