A NEW MULTICOMPONENT POINCAR´E-BECKNER INEQUALITY

STANISLAV KONDRATYEV, L´EONARD MONSAINGEON, AND DMITRY VOROTNIKOV

Abstract. We prove a new vectorial functional inequality of Poincar´e-Beckner type.
The inequality may be interpreted as an entropy-entropy production one for a gradient
ﬂow in the metric space of Radon measures. The proof uses subtle analysis of combina-
tions of related super- and sub-level sets employing the coarea formula and the relative
isoperimetric inequality.

inequality (1) is clearly violated unless I = ∅. Under suitable structural assumptions on

any I), we will show that it is enough for a function u to stay away from the solutions to
(2) with I 6= ∅ in order to comply with inequality (1). The only solution of (2) compatible
with the inequality is thus

u∞ := u∅ = A−1m.

recently proved in [8] that C can be chosen in the form 1/Φ(RΩ u1), where Φ is a strictly

increasing continuous function with Φ(0) = 0 (provided N = 1, m = m1(x) > 0 and
A ≡ 1). The proof in [8] uses a generalized Beckner inequality [1, Lemma 4], that is why

we refer to (1) as Poincar´e-Beckner inequality. However, that proof completely fails in the
multicomponent case due to implicit cross-diﬀusion eﬀects.

Our interest to (1) comes from the fact that in the case of symmetric positive-deﬁnite ma-
trix A(x) and p = 2 inequality (1) is equivalent to an entropy-entropy production inequality
corresponding to the gradient ﬂow of the geodesically non-convex entropy functional

on the space of N -dimensional non-negative Radon measures on Ω equipped with the
unbalanced optimal transport distance and induced Riemannian structure as recently in-
troduced in [8] (see also [9, 3, 10, 2, 6]). This gradient ﬂow coincides with a ﬁtness-driven
PDE system of population dynamics involving degenerate cross-diﬀusion. Inequality (1)
implies exponential convergence of the trajectories of this gradient ﬂow to the coexistence
steady-state u∞ which corresponds to the so-called ideal free distribution [5, 4] of the pop-
ulations. We refer to our companion paper [7] for the details of this interpretation of (1)
and its implications.

The proof of (1) which we carry out in this paper is non-standard, being based on a
subtle analysis of suitable unions of super-level sets of the components of f employing
the coarea formula and the relative isoperimetric inequality. Assuming that there exists a
sequence violating the inequality, either we conclude that it converges one of the degenerate
states uI , or we can detect a drop of fi that can be exploited to estimate the total variation
of fi by means of the coarea formula. To apply this consideration to the term

ZΩ

NXi=1

ui|∇fi|p dx,

we must consider the variation of fi over the region where ui is not small. However, due
to the hidden cross-diﬀusion nature of the problem, this produces “holes” in the level sets
of fi, and we cannot use the relative isoperimetric inequality to estimate the perimeter of
the super-level sets. We patch the holes by merging certain super- and sub-level sets of
diﬀerent fi. Since we argue by contradiction, we are not able to quantify the constant C
in (1).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give our structural conditions on A
and m, and present the main results. In Section 3, we state some algebraic and analytical
properties of f (u) and related nonlinear functions whose proofs may be found in the Ap-
pendix. In Section 4.1, we derive the main estimates for the sequences allegedly violating
(1). In Section 4.2, we identify three possible scenarios which are determined by behavior
of suitable combinations of super- and sub-level sets of fi. The ﬁrst alternative leads to
the convergence to uI (Section 4.3). The second and the third are the most involved ones,
and employ the geometric ideas described above, see Sections 4.4 and 4.5.

2. The main results

Let Ω ⊂ Rd be a bounded, connected, open domain. We assume that it admits the

relative isoperimetric inequality, cf. [11, Remark 12.39]:

P (A; Ω) ≥ cΩ|A|

d−1

d , A ⊂ Ω, |A| ≤

|Ω|.

(4)

Here P (A; Ω) denotes the relative perimeter of a Lebesgue measurable A of locally ﬁnite
perimeter with respect to Ω.

Suppose we are given a vector function m = (m1, . . . , mN ) ∈ C 1(Ω; RN ) and a matrix
function A = (aij) ∈ C 1(Ω; MN (R)). We assume that there exists κ > 0 independent of
x ∈ Ω such that

Remark 1. Letting I = ∅ in (8), we see that all the functions mj are necessarily positive.

Remark 2. Assumptions 2 and 3 allow for a geometrical interpretation, see Section 3.

Remark 3. For a symmetric matrix A, Assumption 2 is equivalent to uniform positive
deﬁniteness. However, we do not assume A to be necessarily symmetric.

Remark 4. The integrand in the right-hand side of (11) is nonnegative, and the integral
may be inﬁnite.

Remark 5. For p > 1, by Vitali’s theorem, the convergence in measure in (9), (10) can be
replaced by the convergence in Lq, 1 ≤ q < p.

Condition (ii) of Theorem 1 means that the set U must be separated from a ﬁnite number
of speciﬁc points in the topology of convergence in measure. Speciﬁcally, it follows from
Assumption 2 that given I ⊂ {1, . . . , N }, the linear system

(cid:26) ui = 0

fj = 0

(i ∈ I)
(j /∈ I),

(12)

has a unique solution uI ∈ C 1(Ω; RN ). It is easy to see that (9) and (10) are equivalent to

un → uI

(n → ∞)

in measure.

(13)

Theorem 1 admits the following stronger formulation.
Solving (12) by Cramer’s rule and recalling the assumptions, we see that all the functions
uI = (uI1, . . . , uIn) are bounded by a constant depending only on κ. Let M = M (κ) be
an arbitrary number such that

M > sup{uIi : I ⊂ {1, . . . , N }; i ∈ {1, . . . , N }}.

(14)

Theorem 2. Let p ≥ 1, A ⊂ C 1(Ω; MN (R) × RN ), and U ⊂ W 1

p (Ω; RN ) be such that

(i) any (A, m) ∈ A satisﬁes Assumptions 1–3 with a constant κ = κ(A);
(ii) u ≥ 0 for any u ∈ U;
(iii) one cannot choose sequences {un} ⊂ U and {(An, mn)} ⊂ A such that {un} is

bounded in Lp, and (9) and (10) hold for an I 6= ∅.

Then there exists C(Ω, p, κ, A, U) > 0 such that

3. Auxiliary functions

In this section we collect a few auxiliary results concerning systems of aﬃne functions

on RN

(i = 1, . . . , N )

(17)

with scalar coeﬃcients. The proofs of the statements can be found in the Appendix.

We say that the coeﬃcients in (17) are admissible, if they satisfy Assumptions 1, 2, and

3 with a ﬁxed κ > 0.

Given I = {i1, . . . , ir} ⊂ {1, . . . , N }, i1 < · · · < ir, and j ∈ {1, . . . , N }, denote the

determinants in the right-hand sides of (7) and (8) by

Remark 6. If the determinants ∆I are nonzero, the systems (12) are exactly determined.
Denoting the solution of (12) by uI = (uI1, . . . , uIN ) as before, for any I we have

uCIi =

∆I\{i},i

∆I

,

fj(uCI ) =

∆I,j
∆I

,

(18)

where CI = {1, . . . , N } \ I. Thus, in the case of admissible coeﬃcients the values of uI and
of fj(uI ) are nonnegative and bounded by a constant depending only on κ, but not on the
particular choice of coeﬃcients. Moreover, if j /∈ I, then uIj are bounded away from zero
by a constant depending on κ, but not on the coeﬃcients. If i ∈ I, the same is true for
fi(uI ).

We want to geometrically interprete the positivity of ∆I and ∆I,j, involved in Assump-

tions 2 and 3. To this end, consider the system of linear inequalities in RN :

(cid:26) fi ≥ 0

(i = 1, . . . , N ),
ui ≥ 0 (i = 1, . . . , N ).

(19)

Proposition 1. Suppose that ∆I 6= 0 for any I ⊂ {1, . . . , N }. Then ∆I > 0 and ∆I,j > 0
for any I ⊂ {1, . . . , N } and j /∈ I if and only if the solution set of (19) is a polytope with
vertices {uI : I ⊂ {1, . . . , N }} combinatorially isomorphic to a cube.

One corollary of Proposition 1 is that in the case of admissible coeﬃcients no vertex
(and hence, no point whatsoever) of the polytope (19) satisﬁes any of the the equations
ui = 0 = fi. A strengthened version of this observation stated in the following lemma plays
a crucial role in our proof.

Lemma 1. There exists σ = σ(κ) such that if for some admissible coeﬃcients, some index
j, and some u = (u1, . . . , uN ) ≥ 0 we have uj ≤ σ and fj(u) ≤ σ, then

min

fi(u) ≤ −σ.

Developing observation (22), the following lemma and its corollaries state that v(u) is
small only in the neighbourhood of the set {uI : I 6= ∅}. This allows to use the function v
to prove convergence of the form (13) and (9)–(10).

that if u ≥ 0 and v(u) < δ for some admissible coeﬃcients, then there exists I 6= ∅ such
that

Corollary 2. We have

As v vanishes only at the points uI (I 6= ∅), it follows from Remark 6 that v = 0 implies
fi > 0 for some i. The following corollary of Lemma 2 extends this observation to the case
of small v.

POINCAR´E-BECKNER INEQUALITY

Corollary 3. There exist ε0 > 0 and σ > 0 depending on κ, but not on admissible
coeﬃcients, such that if v(u) < ε0, there exists i such that fi(u) > σ.

4. Proof of the theorems

4.1. Preliminaries. We prove Theorem 2, and Theorem 1 follows.

Assume that the theorem is not true and there exist a sequence {εn}, sequences of
coeﬃcients {An} ⊂ C 1(Ω; MN (R)) and {mn} ⊂ C 1(Ω; RN ) satisfying Assumptions 1–3
with some κ > 0 and a sequence {(u1n, . . . , uN n)} ⊂ U such that εn → 0 and

ZΩ

NXi=1

˜uin(|fin|p + |∇fin|p) dx ≤ ε2

nZΩ

NXi=1

|fin|p dx,

(29)

where fin corresponds to An and mn.

We claim that without loss of generality the functions {un} can be assumed to be
smooth. Indeed, we always can assume that U is open in the relative topology of the cone
of nonnegative functions in W 1
p , otherwise we can replace it by a small enlargement of U
without aﬀecting the hypothesis of the theorem. Then by Meyers-Serrin theorem we can
approximate un by smooth functions from U such that (29) holds with ε2
n replaced by 2ε2
n.

Denote

˜vn(x) =( 1

gn(x)PN

vn(x)

i=1 ˜uin(x)|fin(x)|p

if gn(x) 6= 0
if gn(x) = 0.

It is obvious that

uin(x) ≤ εn

if and only if

˜uin(x) ≤ εn.

It follows from Lemma 2 and (14) that there exists δ > 0 independent of n and x such
that if vn(x) < δ, then for any i we have uin(x) < M and, consequently, uin(x) = ˜uin(x)
and vn(x) = ˜v(x). In particular, there is no loss of generality in assuming that

vn(x) ≤ εn

if and only if

˜vn(x) ≤ εn.

Write (29) in the form

Lemma 2 implies that if v is bounded, so is u, so there exists M > 0 such that g ≤ M
whenever v < 1. Without loss of generality, εn < 1, so from (30) we conclude

˜uin|∇fin|p dx ≤ M εn|[vn ≤ εn]|.

Moreover, it follows from (30) that the integral

is bounded uniformly with respect to n. Hence the sequence {gn} is bounded in L1 and
{un} is bounded in Lp.
It remains to show that {un} satisﬁes (9) and (10) for some
nonempty I in order to obtain a contradiction.

Lemma 3. Given a > 0,

lim

|[vn > εn] ∩ [gn > a]| = 0.

We choose and ﬁx ε0 ∈ (0, 1) and σ > 0 satisfying Corollary 3 and Lemma 1. As those

Condition 1. If vn(x) < ε0, there exists i such that |fin(x)| > σ.

and we have the inclusion

An(I).

(38)

Combining (37) and (38), we obtain (36).

By Lemma 3, the measure of the left-hand side of inclusion (36) converges to |Ω|, and
(cid:3)

(35) follows.

10

S. KONDRATYEV, L. MONSAINGEON, AND D. VOROTNIKOV

We can assume that the limits

lim
k→∞

An(I)

exist. In view of Lemma 5 we face three logical possibilities:

(i) limn→∞ An(I) = |Ω| for some I 6= ∅;
(ii) limn→∞ An(∅) = |Ω|;
(iii) limn→∞ An(Is) > 0 (s = 1, 2) with I1 6= I2.
We conclude the proof of Theorem 2 by examining the alternatives (i)–(iii). It is fairly
straightforward to demonstrate that (i) implies (9) and (10). A more subtle analysis based
on the coarea formula and the relative isoperimetric inequality shows that (ii) and (iii) are
in fact impossible.

Recall that the relative perimeter of a Lebesgue measurable set A of (locally) ﬁnite

perimeter is deﬁned as

P (A; Ω) = µA(Ω),

where µA is the total variation of the Gauss–Green measure of A (see [11]). We need the
following properties of the perimeters:

Lemma 6 ([11], Proposition 12.19 and Lemma 12.22). If A is a set of locally ﬁnite perime-
ter in Rd, then

if A and B are sets of (locally) ﬁnite perimeter in Rd, then A ∪ B is a set of (locally) ﬁnite
perimeter in Rd, and, for Ω ⊂ Rd open,

supp µA ⊂ ∂A;

P (A ∪ B; Ω) ≤ P (A; Ω) + P (B; Ω).

4.3. Convergence in case (i). Assume that (i) holds. We claim that (9) and (10) are
valid, i. e. for any ε > 0,

By assumption, I 6= ∅, so for any x ∈ An(I) we have fin(x) > σ for at least one i and

thus gn(x) > σp. It follows from Lemma 3 that

lim
k→∞

|An(I) ∩ [vn > εn]| = 0

and consequently

Take x ∈ An(I) ∩ [vn ≤ εn]. By Corollary 1, there exists δ > 0 independent of k and x

Proof. We take an x ∈ Ω such that ujn(x) ≤ εn for some j and show that x is an interior
point of An(t). There are two possibilities: either fjn(x) > t or fjn(x) ≤ t. In the former
case we see immediately that x is an interior point of An(t). In the latter case we have
fjn(x) ≤ σ, and applying Condition 2 we ﬁnd fin such that fin(x) ≤ −σ < −t. But then
|fin(x)| > t, and again x is an interior point of An(t).

Lemma 10. The relative perimeter of An(t) can be estimated as

P (An(t); Ω) ≥ p0,

where p0 > 0 is independent of t and n.

Proof. First of all, observe the inclusions

An(I1) ⊂ An(t) ⊂ Ω \ An(I2).

15

(49)

(50)

Indeed, if x ∈ An(I1), then f1n(x) > σ, so x belongs to the ﬁrst set in the right-hand side
of (48), and the ﬁrst inclusion in (50) holds. On the other hand, if x ∈ An(t), then either
f1n(x) > t > σ/2 or fin(x) < −t < −σ/2 for some i. As 1 /∈ I2, it is clear that in both
cases x /∈ An(I2), so the second inclusion in (50) is also valid.

The isoperimetric inequality for An(t) reads

P (An(t); Ω) ≥ cΩ(cid:16) min(|An(t)|, |Ω \ An(t)|)(cid:17) d−1

d

Estimating by means of (50), we have:

P (An(t); Ω) ≥ cΩ(min(µ1, 1 − µ2))

and (49) follows.

Lemma 11. The following inclusions hold:

∂ΩAn(t) ∩ ∂[f1n > t] ⊂ [u1n > εn]
∂ΩAn(t) ∩ ∂[fin < −t] ⊂ [uin > εn]

(cid:3)

(52)

Proof. If u1n(x) ≤ εn and x ∈ ∂[f1n > t], then f1n(x) = t ≤ σ.
If uin(x) ≤ εn and
x ∈ ∂[fin < −t], then fin(x) = −t ≤ σ. In both cases by Condition 2 there exists j such
that fjn(x) ≤ −σ < −t, so x belongs to the interior of An(t) and the lemma follows.

Proof of Proposition 1. Denote the solution set of (19) by P .

Step 1. Basis of the induction. We use induction over N . A direct veriﬁcation shows

that the statement is true for N = 1.

Step 2. Positivity of the determinants ∆I implies that P is bounded. It is well-known

that the polyhedron P is bounded if and only if the homogeneous system

nontrivial solution. As the system has rank N , it has a nontrivial solution b = (b1, . . . , bN )
satisfying exactly N − 1 independent inequalities with equality. If

then (b1, . . . , bN −1) is a nontrivial solution of

< 0,

for i = 1, . . . , r. Plugging the representation (56) into (55) and applying the Laplace
formula, we obtain

which contradicts the positivity of all ∆I . Thus, P is bounded.

Step 3. Positivity of the determinants implies that the set of vertices of P is {uI : I ⊂
{1, . . . , N }}. According to Remark 6, each uI solves (19). Moreover, uI satisﬁes with
equality the subsystem

of (19) of rank N . Consequently, each uI is a vertex of P . We must prove that P has no
other vertices.

In the hyperplane uN = 0 consider the polyhedron P ′ being the solution set of

(cid:26) ˜fi ≥ 0 (i = 1, . . . , N − 1),

(i = 1, . . . , N − 1),

ui ≥ 0

(57)

where ˜fi is the restriction of fi to the hyperplane. By the induction assumption, P ′ is an
(N − 1)-dimensional polytope with vertices {uI : I ∋ N }. We claim that it is a facet of P .

POINCAR´E-BECKNER INEQUALITY

19

Indeed, let eP be the face of P on the hyperplane {uN = 0}. On this hyperplane eP is given

by

(58)

(cid:26) ˜fi ≥ 0 (i = 1, . . . , N ),

ui ≥ 0

(i = 1, . . . , N − 1),

,

any vertex of P ′ is one of the points uI lying in the hyperplane, so it is a vertex of P and

and the inclusion eP ⊂ P is immediate. On the other hand, by the induction assumption,
also of eP . Consequently, P ′ ⊂ eP . Thus, we have P ′ = eP , and P ′ is an (N − 1)-dimensional

face of P . The vertex u∅ of P does not belong to the hyperplane {uN = 0}, so P has
dimension N , and P ′ is its facet.

Likewise, the interection of P with any hyperplane ui = 0 is a facet of P having the

vertices {uI : I ∋ i}.

Let v = (v1, . . . , vN ) be a vertex of P . Then v satisﬁes with equalities a subsystem
of (19) of rank N consisting of N inequalities. If this subsystem is fi ≥ 0 (i = 1, . . . , N ),
then v = u∅. Otherwise, we have vi = 0 for some i, so v lies in the hyperplane ui = 0
and by the above, coincides with one of uI . Thus, the set of vertices of P is exactly
{uI : I ⊂ {1, . . . , N }}.

Step 4. Positivity of the determinants implies that the facets of P are the intersections
of P with the hyperplanes ui = 0 and fi = 0, i = 1, . . . , N . As P is given by (19), each facet
of P is the intersection of P with a hyperplane of the form ui = 0 or fi = 0. Conversely,
each intersection of this form is a facet of P .
Indeed, we have already checked this in
the case of the hyperplanes ui = 0. Now let P ′ = P ∩ {f1 = 0}. The face P ′ contains,
among others, the vertices uI , where I 6∋ 1 and I ∋ N . By the induction assumption,
these are precisely the vertices of an (N − 2)-dimensional facet of P ′′ = P ∩ {uN = 0}.
Thus, dim P ′ ≥ N − 2. On the other hand, P ′ contains u∅, which is aﬃnely independent
of {uI : I ∋ N }, so actually dim P ′ = N − 1, as claimed.

Step 5. Positivity of the determinants implies that P is combinatorially isomorphic to a

cube. Indeed, considering the cube as the solution set of

(i = 1, . . . , N ),

,

ui ≥ 0 (i = 1, . . . , N ),

we see that the mapping uI 7→ (α1, . . . , αN ), where

(cid:26) 1 − ui ≥ 0
αi =(0,

1

if i ∈ I,
otherwise,

preserves facets.

Step 6. The geometric properties of P imply the positivity of the determinants. Con-
versely, assume that solution set of (19) is a polytope with vertices {uI : I ⊂ {1, . . . , N }}
combinatorially isomorphic to a cube. Observe that given i, the set of vertices of the facet
P ∩ {ui = 0} is {uI : I ∋ i}. Consequently, if i ∈ I, the vertex uCI does not belong to
this facet, so uCIi > 0 whenever i ∈ I. Likewise, fj(uCI ) > 0 whenever j /∈ I. Now it
follows from (18) that all the determinants ∆I and ∆I,j have the same sign. As the facet

20

S. KONDRATYEV, L. MONSAINGEON, AND D. VOROTNIKOV

P ′ = P ∩ {uN = 0} enjoys analogous geometric properties, by induction we see that the
determinants are actually positive.
(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma 1. We ﬁx an admissible set of coeﬃcients and j and prove that

sup{min

i

fi(u) : u = (u1, . . . , uN ) ≥ 0, uj ≤ σ, fj(u) ≤ σ} ≤ −σ

(59)

with some σ independent of the coeﬃcients. For deﬁniteness, assume that j = N .

As above, denote the polytope given by (19) by P .
It follows from Remark 6 that there exists c > 0 independent of the coeﬃcients such that
P has no vertices in the open slab {0 < uN < 2c}. In other words, all the vertices of the
polytope P2c := P ∩ {0 ≤ uN ≤ 2c} lie on the hyperplanes uN = 0 and uN = 2c. It is easy
to check that any point of P2c belonging to the hyperplane uN = c is the midpoint of a line
segment with the endpoints on the facets P ′
2c = P2c ∩ {uN = 2c}
of P , the former being also a facet of P .

2c = P2c ∩ {uN = 0} and P ′′

By Remark 6, there exists c′ > 0 independent of the coeﬃcients such that fN ≥ 2c′ on
2c ⊂ P .

each vertex of the facet P ∩ {uN = 0} = P ′
Consequently, fN ≥ c′ on P2c ∩ {uN = c} = P ∩ {uN = c}.

2c. Also fN ≥ 0 on P ′′

2c, so fN ≥ 2c′ on P ′

By the above, all the vertices of the polytope Pc = P ∩ {0 ≤ uN ≤ c} lie in the halfspace
In other words, the polytope Pc is the

fN ≥ c′, therefore so does the polytope itself.
solution set of

and this system implies the inequality fN − c′ ≥ 0. By the Minkowski–Farkas theorem,
there exist nonnegative αi, βi, γ, and δ such that

fN − c′ =

αifi +

βiui + γ(c − uN ) + δ.

(60)

Generally speaking, representation (60) is not unique, but we claim that possible values
of αi are uniformly bounded with respect to admissible coeﬃcients. Indeed, plugging the
zero vertex into (60), we get

(i = 1, . . . , N − 1),

fi ≥ 0
ui ≥ 0 (i = 1, . . . , N ),
uN ≤ c,

By Remark 6, the right-hand side is bounded, and the values of fi(0) in the left-hand side
are bounded away from 0. Consequently, there exists C > 0 independent of admissible

There are at most N summands in the left-hand side, so for any u satisfying said re-
quirements there exists fi such that fi(u) ≤ −c′/(2CN ). Thus, (59) is valid with σ =
min{c, c′/2, c′/(2CN )}, which is clearly independent of particular choice of admissible co-
eﬃcients.

The following lemma is the ﬁrst step towards proving Lemma 2. It ensures that v does

Proof. Assume the contrary: there exist C > 0, a sequence of admissible sets of coeﬃcients
{(An, mn)} and a sequence {un} ⊂ RN such that un ≥ 0, un → ∞, and 0 ≤ vn(un) ≤ C,
where vn is corresponding to the coeﬃcients (An, mn). By fin denote the aﬃne functions
corresponding to (An, mn), and by f ′

in, associated linear functionals.

By Assumption 1, the sequence {(An, mn)} is bounded. Without loss of generality,
(An, mn) → (A∗, m∗), the limiting coeﬃcients also being admissible. Let fi∗ be the corre-
sponding aﬃne functions, and f ′

i∗ be the associated linear functions.

Without loss of generality,

where bi ≥ 0 is ﬁnite, b = (b1, . . . , bN ) 6= 0, τn → ∞. We have:

uin = biτn + o(τn),

fin(un) = min + f ′
i∗ and the sequences {min} are bounded, we obtain

in(un) = min + f ′

in(b)τn + o(τn) = f ′

As f ′

in → f ′

in(b)τn + o(τn)

fin(un) = f ′

i∗(b)τn + o(τn).

Plugging representations (62) and (63) into the right-hand side of (23), we obtain:

Thus, the right-hand side of (23) grows as τ p+1

n), a contradiction.

Proof of Lemma 2. Suppose, contrary to our claim, that there exist ε > 0, a sequence
{(An, mn)} of admissible coeﬃcients, and a sequence {un = (u1n, . . . , uN n)} ⊂ R+ such
that

and

vn(un) → 0

|un − uIn| ≥ ε

(I 6= ∅),

(64)

where vn and uIn corresponds to the coeﬃcients (An, m). Due to Assumptions 1–3 (see
also Remark 6) there is no loss of generality in assuming that (An, m) → (A∗, m∗), where
the limit is also admissible, and uIn → uI∗ for each I 6= ∅, where the limit satisﬁes (12).
Thus, if v∗ corresponds to the limiting coeﬃcients, we have v∗(u) = 0 if and only if u = uI∗
for some I 6= ∅.

Due to Lemma 12, {un} is bounded, and we can assume that un → u∗ = (u1∗, . . . , uN ∗) ∈
+ . Passing to the limit in (64), we get

RN

|u∗ − uI∗| ≥ ε

(I 6= ∅).

By (24),

vn(un) = 0,

so u∗ 6= u∅ (Remark 6). Thus, g∗(u∗) 6= 0 and we can pass to the limit:

v∗(u∗) = lim
n→∞

vn(un) = 0.

This and the fact that u∗ is nonnegative implies u∗ = uI∗ for some I, which contradicts (65).
(cid:3)

Proof of Corollary 1. Given I 6= ∅, consider the norm

|u|I =Xi∈I

|ui| +Xj /∈I

|f ′

j(u)|,

which implicitly depends on the choice admissible coeﬃcients. Observe that
