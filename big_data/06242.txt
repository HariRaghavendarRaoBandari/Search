Abstract. We discuss the possibility that dark matter corresponds to an oscillating scalar
ﬁeld coupled to the Higgs boson. We argue that the initial ﬁeld amplitude should gener-
ically be of the order of the Hubble parameter during inﬂation, as a result of its quasi-de
Sitter ﬂuctuations. This implies that such a ﬁeld may account for the present dark matter
abundance for masses in the range 10−6 − 10−4 eV, if the tensor-to-scalar ratio is within
the range of planned CMB experiments. We show that such mass values can naturally be
obtained through either Planck-suppressed non-renormalizable interactions with the Higgs
boson or, alternatively, through renormalizable interactions within the Randall-Sundrum sce-
nario, where the dark matter scalar resides in the bulk of the warped extra-dimension and
the Higgs is conﬁned to the infrared brane.

The existence of a signiﬁcantly undetected non-relativistic matter component in the Universe
is widely accepted, with plenty of evidence arising from diﬀerent sources. In particular, the
ﬂatness of the rotational curves of galaxies requires a signiﬁcant dark matter component to
account for the inferred dynamical galactic mass. In addition, the invisible mass of galaxy
clusters and the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Back-
ground (CMB) radiation indicate a dark matter component that accounts for about 26% of
the present energy balance in the Universe. The origin and the constitution of dark matter
remain, however, unknown, despite the large number of candidates that arise in theories
beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics (see e.g. [1] for a review).

The recent discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider [2, 3] has opened
up new possibilities for understanding the nature of dark matter. In fact, several works in the
literature have already considered the possibility that dark matter interacts with the Higgs
ﬁeld in a variety of forms. The ﬁrst models [4–8] considered an extension of the Standard
Model with an additional singlet scalar ﬁeld, φ, with renormalizable interactions with the
Higgs ﬁeld of the form:

V (φ, h) =

(1.1)

where mφ is the ﬁeld mass, λφ its self-coupling term and g the coupling term between the
“phion” and the Higgs ﬁeld. Several analyses of this and related models have been performed
in the literature [9–21] and this possibility has become widely known as “Higgs-portal” dark
matter. A connection to dark energy has also been suggested in [22, 23].

Most of the works in the literature focus, however, on dark matter candidates whose
abundance is set by the standard decoupling and freeze-out mechanism, with masses in the
GeV-TeV range.
In this work, we consider an alternative possibility in which the scalar
ﬁeld φ acquires a large expectation value during inﬂation and begins oscillating after the
electroweak phase transition, behaving as non-relativistic matter. Although a related scenario
was considered e.g. in Ref.
[19], in the latter case interactions are suﬃciently large to lead
to the decay of the scalar condensate and thermalization of the φ-particles, so that the
present-day dark matter abundance also corresponds to a GeV-TeV WIMP thermal relic.

– 1 –

Our proposal considers a scenario where the dark matter ﬁeld is part of a hidden/sequestered

sector with an inherent conformal symmetry, which is broken only by feeble interactions with
the Higgs boson. This implies that the ﬁeld’s mass and self-couplings are extremely small,
which in particular leads to a long-lived oscillating scalar condensate that is never in thermal
equilibrium in the cosmic history. We will consider particular models where this generic idea
can be realized, and show that such a ﬁeld can naturally account for the present dark matter
abundance.

The article is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we describe the main properties of our sce-
nario, focusing on the dynamics of an oscillating scalar ﬁeld in the post-inﬂationary Universe
and considering that the ﬁeld only acquires mass through the Higgs mechanism after the
electroweak phase transition. We determine, in particular, the relation between the ﬁeld’s
mass and initial amplitude required in order to explain the observed dark matter abundance.
In Sec. 3 we discuss the dynamics of the ﬁeld during inﬂation and compute the average ﬁeld
amplitude that results from quasi-de Sitter ﬂuctuations and sets the initial conditions for
the post-inﬂationary evolution. Finally, in Sec. 4 and Sec. 5 we describe particular realiza-
tions of a weak coupling between the φ and Higgs ﬁelds leading to the required ﬁeld mass
to account for dark matter, considering ﬁrstly the case of non-renormalizable operators and
secondly a bulk scalar ﬁeld in the Randall-Sundrum scenario for a warped extra-dimension.
We summarize our conclusions and prospects for future work in Sec. 6.

2 Oscillating scalar ﬁeld as dark matter

Let us start by reviewing why a homogeneous oscillating ﬁeld, φ, with a potential dominated
by a quadratic term, V (φ) = 1
φφ2, behaves as non-relativistic matter. In a generic cosmo-
logical epoch where the scale factor evolves as a (t) = (t/ti)p, with p > 0 and a(ti) = 1, the
Hubble parameter is simply H = p/t. The ﬁeld φ then satisﬁes the Klein-Gordon equation:

2 m2

For mφt (cid:29) 1, the solution of this equation is then approximately given by:

¨φ + 3

˙φ + m2

φφ = 0 .

(2.2)

where we have deﬁned the initial ﬁeld amplitude, φi, and phase, δφ. The energy density of
the oscillating ﬁeld thus evolves, after a few oscillations, as:

(2.3)

which corresponds to the behavior of non-relativistic matter.

We may therefore consider an oscillating scalar ﬁeld as a plausible dark matter candi-
date, provided that it is stable and yields the correct present abundance. In general, the ﬁeld
will begin to oscillate after inﬂation when mφ (cid:39) H. If we consider that the ﬁeld only acquires
mass through the Higgs mechanism, its mass vanishes before electroweak symmetry breaking
and, consequently, H > mφ and the ﬁeld is overdamped, such that its amplitude remains
approximately constant. After the electroweak phase transition at temperatures around 100
GeV, the ﬁeld acquires a mass that eventually becomes larger than the Hubble parameter.
The ﬁeld then becomes underdamped and begins to oscillate as obtained above. This will

g∗ = NB + (7/8)NF is the total number of relativistic degrees of freedom, including NB and
NF bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom, respectively.

From Eq. (2.3), we may deﬁne an eﬀective number density of φ particles in the oscillating

scalar condensate:

where g∗S = NB + 3

to the entropy. Using Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6), it is easy to see that the number of particles in a
comoving volume:

(2.7)

This is a conserved quantity since, due to the entropy conservation, S = sa3 remains constant
throughout the history of the Universe.
We consider now two separate cases, since the ﬁeld only acquires its mass after the
electroweak phase transition at TEW ∼ 100 GeV. If, on the one hand, the ﬁeld mass is
√
EW /MP ∼ 10−5 eV, with g∗ ∼ 100 1, the
smaller than the Hubble rate HEW = π/
ﬁeld will only start to oscillate after the phase transition. If, on the other hand, mφ (cid:38) HEW ,
oscillations start as soon as the Higgs ﬁeld acquires its vacuum expectation value, which we
take approximately to be at TEW .

In the ﬁrst case, for mφ (cid:46) HEW , the temperature at which mφ = H is given by:

1Note that the electroweak phase transition is not instantaneous, and both the temperature and the
number of relativistic species vary during the phase transition. This simpliﬁed approach to consider a given
temperature and g∗, it gives nevertheless a suﬃciently good approximation for determining the main properties
of the dark matter ﬁeld.

For the case where the ﬁeld starts oscillating immediately after the electroweak phase
transition, for mφ (cid:38) HEW , we take the temperature at the beginning of ﬁeld oscillations to
be TEW and, following the same steps as for the previous case, we obtain:

Then, assuming that the ﬁeld accounts for all of the present dark matter abundance, Ωφ,0 (cid:39)

3 Inﬂation and initial conditions for the scalar ﬁeld

In the previous section we have determined the values of the ﬁeld mass that may account for
the present dark matter abundance as a function of its initial oscillation amplitude. As has
been previously observed in the literature [15], the initial conditions for scalar ﬁeld oscillations
in the post-inﬂationary Universe are set by the inﬂationary dynamics itself, depending on
whether the ﬁeld mass is greater or smaller than the inﬂationary Hubble parameter, Hinf .

We have assumed above that the dark matter ﬁeld φ acquires mass through the Higgs
mechanism, such that its mass during inﬂation would depend on the inﬂationary dynamics of
the Higgs ﬁeld itself. As we will see below, we will be interested in extremely small couplings
between φ and the Higgs ﬁeld of order v/MP l ∼ 10−16, where v = 246 GeV is the Higgs vac-
uum expectation value (vev). This implies that the ﬁeld mass during inﬂation will be at most
of the order of the electroweak scale unless the Higgs ﬁeld acquires super-planckian values.
The dark matter ﬁeld would thus be light during inﬂation, and consequently exhibit de-Sitter
ﬂuctuations of order Hinf /2π on super-horizon scales. This would be phenomenologically un-
acceptable, since this would lead to large inhomogeneities in the dark matter density that
would lead to sizeable cold dark matter isocurvature modes in the CMB spectrum as e.g. for
the case of axions (see e.g. Ref. [25]).

The Higgs ﬁeld need not, however, be the unique source of mass for the dark matter
ﬁeld. In fact, in most extensions of the Standard Model with additional scalar ﬁelds, the
latter typically acquire masses of the order of the Hubble parameter during inﬂation. This is,
for example, the case of supergravity models, where the scalar potential involves terms of the
form V (φ) ∼ eK(φ)/M 2
P l + . . ., where µ4 is the inﬂationary energy
density, for canonical forms of the K¨ahler potential. This results in ﬁeld masses of order

P lµ4 + ··· ∼ µ4 + µ4|φ|2/M 2

– 4 –

µ2/MP ∼ Hinf , which is origin of the so-called “eta-problem” found in supergravity/string
inﬂationary scenarios (see e.g. Ref. [26]).

From a more general eﬀective ﬁeld theory point of view, we may argue that, even if
there are no direct renormalizable interactions between the dark matter and the inﬂaton
scalar ﬁelds, gravitational interactions may induce non-renormalizable terms of the form:

Lint =

c
2

φ2V (χ)

M 2
pl

,

(3.1)

where χ is the inﬂaton ﬁeld and c is a dimensionless parameter. This leads to a contribution
to the ﬁeld mass mφ ∼ cHinf during inﬂation that vanishes in the post-inﬂationary era,
assuming that V (χ) = 0 in the ground state. The magnitude (and sign) of this mass cannot
be determined in the absence of a UV-complete description of the theory, but in the absence
of ﬁne-tuning we expect |c| ∼ O(1), and we will focus on the case c > 0 where the minimum
of the φ potential lies at the origin.
A massive ﬁeld with mφ ∼ Hinf will nevertheless exhibit quantum ﬂuctuations that
get stretched and ampliﬁed by expansion during the quasi-de Sitter inﬂationary phase. For
mφ/Hinf < 3/2, the amplitude of each Fourier mode with comoving momentum k is given
by [27]:

. Notice that ﬂuctuations do not “freeze” on super-horizon scales,

where νφ =
for k < aHinf , unless νφ (cid:39) 3/2, i.e. unless the ﬁeld is very light.
Instead, for a massive
ﬁeld, ﬂuctuations are exponentially damped as inﬂation proceeds. The homogeneous ﬁeld
component can be obtained by integrating over all super-horizon modes, yielding for the
variance of the scalar ﬁeld:

(cid:18) Hinf

(3.3)
where, in the last step, we have taken e−Ne (cid:28) 1 for Ne = 50 − 60 e-folds of inﬂation. Notice
that the ﬁeld variance becomes constant, even though each super-horizon Fourier mode is
continuously damped. This is associated with the fact that there are always modes k ∼ aHinf
that give a signiﬁcant contribution to the variance.

Integrating over k, at the end of inﬂation, we get for the ﬁeld variance:

and the isocurvature power spectrum is:

PI (k) (cid:39) 2π2

(3.7)
Let us focus on the case mφ ∼ Hinf (with real values of νφ), and determine the minimum
ﬁeld mass during inﬂation that leads to CDM isocurvature perturbations compatible with
observations. For this we consider the dimensionless power spectrum:

Notice that the comoving scales that are relevant for CMB perturbations have left the horizon
50-60 e-folds before the end of inﬂation, such that at the end of inﬂation k/aHinf (cid:39) e−Ne (cid:28) 1.
Isocurvature modes are then measured in terms of the ratio:

R (cid:39) 2.2 × 10−9 is the amplitude of the adiabatic curvature perturbation spectrum
where ∆2
generated by the inﬂaton ﬁeld χ. Note that the dark matter ﬁeld is sub-dominant during
inﬂation, so that its ﬂuctuations do not induce perturbations in the space-time curvature.
CDM isocurvature modes and adiabatic modes will be uncorrelated, since ﬂuctuations in φ
and χ are independent. The Planck collaboration places an upper bound on uncorrelated
CDM isocurvature perturbations βiso (kmid) < 0.037 for kmid = 0.050 Mpc−1 [28]. Using the
above results, this yields νφ (cid:46) 1.3 for 55 e-folds of inﬂation, implying mφ (cid:38) 0.75Hinf .
This lower bound on the dark matter ﬁeld mass during inﬂation allows us to place an
upper bound on the variance of the ﬁeld at the end of inﬂation of (cid:104)φ2(cid:105) (cid:46) 0.252 H 2
inf , and for
masses of the order of the Hubble parameter during inﬂation we have (cid:104)φ2(cid:105) = α2H 2
inf , with
α (cid:39) 0.1−0.25. This variance will set the average amplitude of the ﬁeld at the end of inﬂation,
and since the ﬁeld remains overdamped until after the electroweak phase transition, we take
the initial amplitude for ﬁeld oscillations in the post-inﬂationary era to be in this range, i.e.:

φi (cid:39) αHinf ,

α (cid:39) 0.1 − 0.25 .

(3.10)

We may express the Hubble parameter during inﬂation in terms of the tensor-to-scalar ratio,
r = ∆2
R, since the amplitude of the primordial gravitational wave spectrum is a direct
probe of the inﬂationary energy scale, with:

(3.11)

Replacing this into Eq. (2.12), we can obtain a relation between the dark matter ﬁeld mass

This relation is illustrated in Fig. 1, where one can see that the upper bound r < 0.11
set by the Planck collaboration at 95% C.L. [28] leads to a lower bound on the ﬁeld mass
mφ (cid:38) 10−6 − 10−5 eV for α (cid:39) 0.1 − 0.25.

In the next sections we discuss possible scenarios that may lead to ﬁeld masses of this

order through the electroweak Higgs mechanism.

4 Non-renormalizable interactions between the dark matter and Higgs

ﬁelds

The present dark matter abundance and the initial conditions set by the inﬂationary dynam-
ics require very small scalar ﬁeld masses, unless the tensor-to-scalar ratio is very suppressed.
If the dark matter ﬁeld were to couple directly to the Higgs ﬁeld, via renormalizable opera-
tors, we would expect a mass not much below e.g. the electron mass, unless the coupling is
unnaturally small. However, we may envisage theories where such couplings are not present
and, for instance, the dark matter ﬁeld belongs to a hidden sector that is sequestered from
the visible sector, which contains the Standard Model ﬁelds and in particular the Higgs bo-
son. The absence of bare mass and self-coupling terms for the dark matter ﬁeld could, for
example, be motivated by a conformal symmetry in the hidden sector. The two sectors
may, nevertheless, be indirectly coupled through heavy messenger ﬁelds that are e.g. charged
under the gauge symmetries of both sectors. Even in the absence of such messengers, the
two sectors will be coupled through gravity. Taking a strictly eﬀective ﬁeld theory point of
view, we may consider that the conformal symmetry in the hidden sector is broken only by
non-renormalizable terms suppressed by a mass scale M that corresponds to the messenger
mass, or MP in the case of gravity-mediated interactions.
Imposing a Z2 reﬂection symmetry on the dark matter ﬁeld, i.e. the invariance of the
Lagrangian under φ → −φ, we can ensure the stability of the ﬁeld, since linear terms that
allow for its decay are thus forbidden.
In this case, the lowest-order non-renormalizable
operator involving the dark matter and the Higgs ﬁeld is of dimension-6 and takes the form:

where a6 is a dimensionless parameter, which we expect to be O(1). It is then easy to see

(4.2)

This implies that one obtains a dark matter ﬁeld mass in the range required by the observed
abundance for Planck-suppressed interactions, assuming inﬂation occurs close to the GUT
scale and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is not too suppressed (r (cid:38) 10−3). If inﬂation occurs at an
energy scale somewhat below the GUT scale, leading to lower values of the tensor-to-scalar
ratio, the observed dark matter abundance would require larger values of mφ, and these could
equally be motivated e.g. by messenger masses at or below the GUT scale.

The case of Planck-suppressed interactions seems, however, rather special, since the
hierarchy between the electroweak and Planck scales leads to a similar hierarchy between the
dark matter and Higgs masses. This motivates going beyond the eﬀective ﬁeld theory per-
spective and ﬁnding a concrete and well-motivated scenario where this hierarchy is naturally
obtained, as we describe in the next section.

5 Scalar ﬁeld dark matter in warped extra-dimensions

A concrete realization of the hierarchy mentioned in the previous section in the context of
an eﬀective ﬁeld theory can be found in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) scenario for warped
extra-dimensions [29]. The RS construction considers a model with one additional spatial
dimension with a warped geometry, and which is compactiﬁed in an orbifold S1/Z2. This
geometry can be viewed as an eﬀective dimensional reduction of brane-models in 10/11-
dimensional string/M-theory, where brane tensions are responsible for warping the geometry
in the directions transverse to their world-volume.

The bulk geometry is a slice of anti-de Sitter space (AdS5), where the metric corresponds

to the warped product:

ds2 = e−2σ(y)gµνdxµdxν + dy2,

(5.1)
where y ∈ [−L, L] is the radial coordinate along the extra-dimension, for L = πrc with rc
denoting the compactiﬁcation radius, and µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3. The warp factor is given in terms
of the linear function σ(y) = k|y|, where k is the bulk AdS curvature. The orbifold symmetry
has two ﬁxed points at y = 0 and y = L, where branes of opposite tension reside. Einstein’s
equations then require a particular relation between the brane tensions and the (negative)
bulk cosmological constant.

In their original proposal, Randall and Sundrum observed that if the Standard Model
ﬁelds, in particular the Higgs boson, were conﬁned to the brane at y = L, the Higgs mass
and its expectation value would be exponentially suppressed with respect to the fundamental
mass scale in the construction, which is taken to be the Planck scale. One then naturally
obtains a large hierarchy e−kL (cid:39) v/MP (cid:39) 10−16 between the electroweak and gravitational
scales for a relatively small extra-dimension, providing a simple solution to the well-known
gauge hierarchy problem. The Randall-Sundrum model has, since its original proposal, been
the object of several analyses and extensions, including e.g. scenarios where the Standard
Model gauge and fermion ﬁelds reside in the bulk [30, 31], which could explain e.g. the
measured fermion mass hierarchy.

Here we will show that the required hierarchy between the dark matter and Higgs ﬁeld
masses can also be naturally obtained within the RS construction, if the dark matter ﬁeld
corresponds to the zero-mode of a bulk scalar ﬁeld that is coupled to the Higgs ﬁeld on the
“visible” or “infrared” brane at y = L. We start with the following ﬁve-dimensional action
for the Higgs and dark matter sectors:

the dark matter ﬁeld as its zero-mode and g5 is the ﬁve-dimensional coupling between the
Higgs and bulk scalars on the visible brane. In general, we may include a bare mass term
for the scalar ﬁeld, that is even under the Z2 orbifold symmetry and can be parametrized as
[30]:

Φ = ak2 + bσ(cid:48)(cid:48) ,

where a and b are dimensionless parameters yielding the bulk and boundary contributions to
the ﬁeld mass, such that:

From the ﬁve-dimensional action we may derive the equation of motion for the bulk
scalar. Assuming that a perturbative approach is valid, we may ﬁrst neglect the brane-
localized interactions with the Higgs ﬁeld, to obtain:

Using the metric Eq. (5.1), this can be written in the form:

where we used that e−kL ∼ v/MP (cid:28) 1.

zero-mode and the Higgs ﬁelds:

where we have rescaled the Higgs ﬁeld h → ekLh in order for it to have a canonically
normalized kinetic term in four dimensions, and denoted the zero-mode ﬁeld φ0(x) ≡ φ(x).
5k is a dimensionless quantity and that the AdS curvature k (cid:39) MP is
Thus, noting that g2
the fundamental scale in the RS scenario, we expect the eﬀective four-dimensional coupling
between φ and the Higgs ﬁeld to be:

g =

5ke−2kL (cid:39) O(1) × v
g2
MP

∼ 10−16 .

(5.15)

Thus, assuming that the ﬁve-dimensional coupling has a natural value g5 ∼ k−1/2, we con-
clude that, after the electroweak symmetry is broken, the zero-mode of our bulk scalar
acquires a mass mφ ∼ v2/MP ∼ 10−5 eV, just like for the non-renormalizable interactions
considered in the previous section. Of course the ﬁve-dimensional coupling may somewhat
diﬀer from the natural scale without much ﬁne-tuning of the extra-dimensional model, but
this shows that the zero-mode of a conformal bulk scalar in the RS model acquires a mass
in the correct range to account for the dark matter in the Universe as an oscillating scalar
ﬁeld. The eﬀect of a Planck-suppressed non-renormalizable operator is thus analogous to a
renormalizable interaction in a higher-dimensional warped geometry.

One of the assumptions of the generic analysis we performed in the previous sections
is that the dark matter ﬁeld acquires a Hubble-scale mass during inﬂation from a non-
renormalizable coupling to the inﬂaton ﬁeld. This can be implemented within the RS con-
struction if, for example, the inﬂaton ﬁeld χ also lives on the visible brane and we consider
brane-localized interactions of the form:

SΦ,χ = h5

√−G δ (y − L) Φ2 V (χ) .

Since, by dimensional analysis, h5 ∼ k−3 ∼ M−3
P , it is easy to conclude that the eﬀective
four-dimensional coupling between the inﬂaton and the dark matter zero-mode ﬁeld is of the
form φ2V (χ)/k2 ∼ φ2V (χ)/M 2
P , thus naturally yielding a Hubble-scale mass for the dark
matter ﬁeld during inﬂation which vanishes in the post-inﬂationary era.

Within the RS construction, the remaining KK modes of the bulk scalar ﬁeld could,
in principle, also contribute to the dark matter density if they oscillate with a suﬃciently
large amplitude after inﬂation. Although we will not analyze the properties of these modes
in detail, referring the reader to existing discussions in the literature as e.g. Ref.
[30], we
must ensure that they will not overcontribute to the dark matter density. In particular, for
n > 1, the mass spectrum for an even ﬁeld with a = b = 0 is given by:

πke−kL ,

(5.17)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

mn (cid:39)

n +

such that the lowest KK masses lie at the TeV scale and are, hence, much heavier than the
zero-mode. This could lead to an overabundance of dark matter, but we note that the KK
mode functions are given approximately by:

√

fn(y) (cid:39)

2kLek(2y−L) J2

(cid:0)mneky/k(cid:1)

J2 (mnekL/k)

.

(5.18)

This implies that their coupling to ﬁelds on the visible brane is exponentially larger than
the coupling of the zero-mode, with fn(L) = ekLf0(L), and consequently that their mass
during inﬂation is necessarily much larger than the inﬂationary Hubble scale. Since these
may actually be super-planckian, it is not possible to study their dynamics during inﬂation as
for the case of the zero-mode, but this analysis nevertheless shows that we do not expect the
KK modes of the bulk scalar to develop large expectation values during inﬂation and hence
oscillate with a large amplitude in the post-inﬂationary eras. However, those heavy modes
might decay rather quickly through gravitational coupling and then we expect that indeed
only the zero-mode contributes signiﬁcantly to the present abundance of non-relativistic
matter.

Finally, in our previous dynamical analysis of the oscillating dark matter ﬁeld, we have
neglected the eﬀects of any ﬁeld self-interactions. Although the assumption of a bulk con-
formal symmetry for the ﬁve-dimensional scalar ﬁeld implies that no bare self-interaction
terms exist, we must take into account that this symmetry is broken on the visible brane
by the interactions with the Higgs ﬁeld (as well as the inﬂaton but this does not aﬀect the
post-inﬂationary dynamics). This generates, in particular, a quartic coupling for the dark
matter zero-mode ﬁeld through radiative corrections. At 1-loop, these corrections correspond
to the diagram in Fig. 2, which up to numerical factors and the usual logarithms generates
a quartic-self coupling λ ∼ g4.

6 Conclusions

In this work, we have analyzed the possibility of an oscillating scalar ﬁeld, φ, which acquires
mass through the Higgs mechanism, accounting for the observed dark matter abundance in
the Universe.

We have argued that the ﬁeld acquires a large expectation value during inﬂation, just
below the inﬂationary Hubble parameter, due to quasi-de Sitter quantum ﬂuctuations, which
sets the average initial amplitude of the ﬁeld oscillations. Despite the large overall variance of
the ﬁeld, its ﬂuctuations on the presently observable CMB scales are exponentially damped,
since scalar ﬁelds generically acquire Hubble-scale masses through gravitationally-induced
couplings to the inﬂaton. Thus, in contrast with e.g. axion ﬁelds, which remain mass-
less during inﬂation and acquire large ﬂuctuations on all super-horizon scales, inﬂationary
ﬂuctuations would not generate signiﬁcant matter isocurvature perturbations in the present
scenario.

After inﬂation the ﬁeld becomes massless and its amplitude remains approximately
frozen until the electroweak phase transition, after which the ﬁeld acquires a small mass
through its coupling to the Higgs ﬁeld. Eventually the ﬁeld becomes underdamped and
begins to oscillate about the origin, behaving as cold dark matter. We have also imposed
a Z2 symmetry on the Lagrangian that ensures the stability of the dark matter ﬁeld. The
observed dark matter abundance then allows us to determine the ﬁeld mass as a function
of the inﬂationary Hubble scale, and the current Planck bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio
[28] sets a lower bound on the ﬁeld mass mφ (cid:38) 10−6 − 10−5 eV.
If inﬂation occurs close to the GUT scale and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is within the
range of planned CMB experiments, r (cid:38) 10−3, we concluded that the mass of the scalar ﬁeld
must saturate the above bound, and we observed that this implies the approximate hierarchy
between the dark matter mass and the Higgs expectation value:

mφ
v

∼ v
MP

.

(6.1)

We have then explored diﬀerent scenarios where this hierarchy may be attained. A ﬁrst,
more generic, possibility is that the dark matter and Higgs ﬁelds are only coupled through
Planck-suppressed gravitational interactions. We have, in addition, presented a more concrete
possibility that the dark matter ﬁeld is the zero-mode of a ﬁve-dimensional scalar ﬁeld living
in a warped extra-dimension.
In the context of the Randall-Sundrum model, this mode
acquires a mass through its coupling to the Higgs ﬁeld, which is conﬁned to the visible brane
at the bottom of the warped throat. We have also shown that, within this scenario, this ﬁeld
acquires a Hubble-scale mass during inﬂation, as initially assumed, when the the inﬂaton is
also localized on the visible brane.

A generic feature of these scenarios is that the dark matter ﬁeld has no bare mass
or self-interactions, which may be motivated by imposing a conformal symmetry that is
broken only by the non-renormalizable or brane-localized interactions with the Higgs ﬁeld
after electroweak symmetry breaking. The resulting interactions between the dark matter and
Higgs bosons are thus extremely suppressed, with an eﬀective coupling g ∼ 10−16. On the one
hand, this justiﬁes neglecting any dissipative eﬀects in the dynamics of the oscillating scalar

– 12 –

ﬁeld, which could e.g. lead to its evaporation and subsequent thermalization as considered
in [19]. On the other hand, this will make its detection extremely diﬃcult. Although we
will leave a detailed analysis of possible experimental signatures for a future publication, we
expect that such a dark matter candidate will evade detection in ongoing or even planned
experiments involving nuclear recoil.

The dark matter ﬁeld exhibits, however, some similarities with axions and other axion-
like particles, namely in terms of its small mass and couplings to known particles. This
suggests that it may be possible to probe the existence and properties of the proposed dark
matter scalar ﬁeld with experiments analogous to those employed in the search of axion-like
particles, or even using similar indirect astrophysical signatures. The nature and interac-
tion structure of these ﬁelds are, nevertheless, suﬃciently diﬀerent that one may hope to
distinguish them experimentally.

This work shows that dark matter, as the known particles in the Standard Model,
may acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism, despite its hidden/sequestered nature. It
shows, in addition, that the Higgs portal can oﬀer alternative dark matter candidates to the
thermal WIMPs typically considered in the literature, and that the properties of dark matter
can also be used to probe the mechanism behind inﬂation in the early Universe. We thus
hope that our work motivates further exploration of the diﬀerent possibilities presented and
other potentially related scenarios.
