(Dated: March 16, 2016)

We analyzed quantum phase transitions in the antiferromagnetic dimerized spin- 1

2 XY chain and
two-leg ladders. Their gapped phases possess distinct nonlocal string order parameters (SOPs)
and the hidden symmetry breaking in each phase is identiﬁed. After mapping of the original spin
Hamiltonians onto the tight-binding models with Dirac or Majorana fermions and the mean-ﬁeld
approximation (for ladders), the essential physics of nonlocal orders can be grasped analytically. By
utilizing duality transformations the calculation of SOPs is mapped onto the local order problem in
some dual representation and done without further approximations. The phases with hidden orders
can also be distinguished by topological winding numbers. The latter provide a complimentary
description. Our main result is the framework to treat nonlocal orders and hidden symmetries
which uniﬁes the key elements of the Landau paradigm with the new concept of topological order.
This uniﬁed framework can be straightforwardly applied for spin chain and ladders, topological
insulators and superconductors. Applications of this theory to other systems are under way.

INTRODUCTION

changes.16–18

According to the Landau theory of phase transitions,
the phases on both sides of a critical point can be distin-
guished by diﬀerent types of the long-range order, or its
absence. The ordering is described by an appropriately
chosen local order parameter. In the Landau framework
phases are distinct due to their diﬀerent symmetries, and
a continuous phase transition is always related to sym-
metry breaking of system’s Hamiltonian.1

However, there is a mounting number of examples of
systems where the states of matter and their change can-
not be classiﬁed in terms of the explicit symmetry break-
ing and/or local order parameter, most notably a par-
ticular class of gapped systems known as quantum spin
liquids.2,3 One of the best known example of such quan-
tum liquids is realized in the Fractional Quantum Hall
Eﬀect. Most likely, such a quantum (resonating valence
bond) spin liquid is also seen in the pseudogap phase
of the high-Tc cuprates.2 Low-dimensional and/or frus-
trated systems provide a lot of possibilities for realiza-
tion of various exotic quantum liquid states, where a lo-
cal long-range order is prevented even at zero temper-
ature. In low-dimensional quantum magnets, fermions,
and topological insulators/superconductors the existence
of gapped phases and transitions between them are not
necessarily accompanied by breaking of some local sym-
metry. See2–13 and more references there.

To characterize these states a concept of topological
order was introduced.2 It is often associated with the
nontrivial Pontryagin, Chern or similar topological num-
bers (indices).3,13,14 Hatsugai and co-workers15 proposed
the quantized Berry phase as a quantum order parameter
to probe nonlocal orders. This scheme was successfully
applied, e.g., for several quantum spin liquid systems. It
turns out that the change of the quantized Berry phase
can diagnose also crossovers between the states which are
not separated by gap closing, local symmetry or order

It has been also suggested that topological entangle-
ment, derived from the von Neumann entropy, provides
another quantitative measure of topological order since
quantum critical points separating diﬀerent phases can
be identiﬁed with extrema of the entanglement entropy.19
To characterize phases with hidden nonlocal or topo-
logical orders the concept of string order parameter
(SOP) introduced by den Nijs and Rommelse is partic-
ularly instrumental.20 The appearance of such nonlocal
order is accompanied by a hidden symmetry breaking.21
SOPs are successfully applied to characterize quantum
phases with hidden orders in various spin chains and lad-
ders at zero temperature.5,7–9,12,21–23

The important property of SOP is that it can be used
for both quantum and thermal phase transitions. For in-
stance, the SOP can be used for analysis of the thermal
transitions into a Kosterlitz-Thouless-type phase with an
algebraic order.20 Very importantly, the SOP is a proper
order parameter in the sense of Landau:
for the inte-
grable models one can calculate exactly the critical in-
dices β and η from the SOP and the string-string corre-
lation function, resp., near the critical point22 and check
explicitly that such β, η along with other critical indices
satisfy the standard hyperscaling relations.23 Since the
SOP is a limit of a nonlocal correlation function, its ana-
lytical calculation is a diﬃcult task even for exactly solv-
able models. For example, for the dimerized Heisenberg
spin- 1
2 chain the calculation is quite simple in the leading
sine-Gordon approximation for the Hamiltonian22, while
taking into account the marginal terms renders the prob-
lem much more diﬃcult24, and more work is still needed.
The other subtlety is that only for a spin chain or a two-
leg ladder the deﬁnition of the SOPs is straightforward,
while already for a three-leg ladder8,9,23, to say noth-
ing about a 2D lattice, there are many ways to deﬁne
the SOP. Potential multitude of SOPs and their critical
properties need further analysis.

There is an extensive recent literature on hidden orders
in massive phases of Heisenberg ladders. In particular,
the critical properties of the dimerized two- and three-
leg ladders have been studied in numerical and analytical
works.9,23,25–31 Quantum critical lines or even gapless re-
gions in the parameter space adjacent to various massive
phases of spin ladders may be also induced by frustra-
tions, magnetic ﬁelds, or four-spin interactions.5,6

The nonlocal SOP can be deﬁned for bosonic systems
as well.32,33 Moreover, this nonlocal order was even ob-
served for bosons in optical lattice.34

Another interesting class of models where nonlocal
string-like order parameters turned out to be essential
are the probabilistic cellular automata which have been
experiencing a steadily growing interest during the last
It was shown recently35 that the ac-
several decades.
tive phases of the (1+1)-dimensional automation models
possess numerous percolative nonlocal order parameters
emerging as cascades of geometric phase transitions.

There has been an opinion expressed in the literature
that various low-dimensional fermionic or spin systems
with hiddenly ordered phases and transitions between
them, defy completely the Landau paradigm. It appears
to us that such a claim is too radical, and one can for-
mulate the theory of such transitions consistent with the
Landau framework using the nonlocal SOPs.36 The Lan-
dau picture needs however to be amended, since some
facets of topological order quantiﬁed by topological in-
dices, Berry phases, entanglement, are not reducible even
to nonlocal SOPs. The major problem is that the current
treatment of such systems in most cases is heavily nu-
merical and the qualitative physical picture is obscured.
It is really warranted to put more weight ﬁrst on ad-
vancing relatively simple analytical approaches based on
the eﬀective (mean-ﬁeld) models, similar, e.g., to the Ki-
taev model11,12, or the single-particle tight-binding mod-
els used for the analyses of the topological insulators and
superconductors.13 Results based on those models clearly
indicate that interactions are not an indispensable ele-
ment of the topological order framework.

In the present paper we carry out such program from
analyses of the dimerized XY chain and the two-leg
Heisenberg ladders with staggered and columnar dimer-
izations. The ﬁrst exactly-solvable model is equivalent
to noninteracting Jordan-Wigner fermions. To treat the
ladders, we use the Jordan-Wigner tranformation and
the mean-ﬁeld approximation to obtain an eﬀective free-
fermionic Hamiltonian for the spin ladder. In the earlier
related work it has been shown that such approximation
is quite adequate, even quantitatively.23,30,37 By utilizing
duality transformations we demonstrate that it is possi-
ble to map the problem of calculation of nonlocal SOPs
in the chain and ladders onto the problem of a local (Lan-
dau) order parameter in the dual representation, where
the dual models are given by exactly-solvable Hamiltoni-
ans and their order parameters can be calculated exactly.
It is then also straightforward to relate appearance of
the SOP with the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the

2

dual Hamiltonian. In addition we show that the gapped
phases not only have distinct SOPs, but they can also be
distinguished by the winding (Pontryagin) number.

These results allow us to stress close similarities be-
tween various gapped phases occurring in spin models
and topological insulators/supecronductors. The latter
are of great current interest.3,13 The proposed approach
provides a unifying theoretical framework to deal with
nonlocal order parameters in such seemingly diﬀerent sys-
tems within the Landau paradigm.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II
we introduce and discuss the dimerized 1D XY model.
Using the duality transformation, the SOPs and local
order parameters are calculated exactly. We also ﬁnd
the winding numbers for diﬀerent phases of the model.
In Sec. III we present analogous results for the dimer-
ized two-leg ladders. A mean-ﬁeld approximation is used
to construct the eﬀective Hamiltonian for the Jordan-
Wigner fermions which were mapped back onto exactly
solvable (dual) spin models. The Appendix contains de-
tails of the order parameter calculation for the quantum
Ising chain with the three-spin interaction. The results
are summarized in the concluding Sec. IV.

II. DIMERIZED XY CHAIN

A. Transformations of the Hamiltonian

To analyze in depth various aspects of the conven-
tional Landau and the topological orders we start from
the dimerized quantum XY chain:

H =

where σ-s are the standard Pauli matrices, J is the
nearest-neighbor exchange coupling (we assume it to be
antiferromagnetic), and γ and δ are the dimensionless
parameters of anisotropy and dimerization, respectively.
This exactly-solvable model was ﬁrst introduced and an-
alyzed by Ye et al 38 in the presence of uniform magnetic
ﬁeld. To make connections with ladder models discussed
below we added to the Hamiltonian (1) an alternating
transverse ﬁeld. The standard Jordan-Wigner transfor-
mation (JWT)39 maps spins onto free fermions

H =

where the Fourier transforms of the Jordan-Wigner
fermions residing on the even/odd sites of the chain are
uniﬁed in the Nambu spinor

e(k), d†

k =(cid:0)d†

o(k), de(−k), do(−k)(cid:1) ,

(3)

with the wavenumbers restricted to the Brillouin zone
(BZ) k ∈ [−π/2, π/2] and we set the lattice spacing a = 1.
The 4 × 4 Hamiltonian can be written as
H(k) = J cos kΓ3 + Jδ sin kΓ4 + hΓ5 − Jγ sin kΓ13 , (4)
where the ﬁve Dirac matrices are:

Γ1,..,5 = {σ1 ⊗ 1, σ2 ⊗ 1, σ3 ⊗ σ1, σ3 ⊗ σ2, σ3 ⊗ σ3} (5)
and Γ13 = [Γ1, Γ3]/2i = −σ2 ⊗ σ1. This Hamiltonian has
four eigenvalues ±ǫ± where

ǫ±(k) = Jscos2 k +(cid:16)r(cid:16) h
J(cid:17)2

+ δ2 sin2 k ± γ sin k(cid:17)2

.

(6)
From (6) we infer a remarkable property of the model
(1): each of the relevant perturbations h, δ, γ makes the
uniform isotropic XX chain gapfull with the gap

∆ = J(cid:12)(cid:12)q(h/J)2 + δ2 ± γ(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

while those terms cancel along the lines of quantum crit-
icality

(7)

(8)

γ = ±q(h/J)2 + δ2 .

and the model becomes gapless. The same cancelation
eﬀect happens in dimerized ladders considered in the next
section, but contrary to ladders, the present model can
be treated exactly at each step.

When we turn oﬀ the ﬁeld the spectrum of the model

(1) becomes:38

ǫ±(k) = Jqcos2 k + (δ ± γ)2 sin2 k

with the gap

∆ = J|γ ± δ| .

(9)

(10)

Now we will analyze the nature of order and symmetry
changes on the lines of the quantum phase transition γ =
±δ on the parameter plane (δ, γ). We utilize the duality
transformation:40

(12)

where τ -s obey the standard algebra of the Pauli oper-
ators, and they reside on the sites of the dual lattice,
which can be placed between the sites of the original
chain where the operators σ reside. In terms of the dual
operators, the Hamiltonian (1) becomes a sum of two
completely decoupled 1D Quantum Ising Model (QIM)
Hamiltonians deﬁned on the even and odd sites of the

dual lattice:

B. Local and String Order Parameters

We deﬁne the string operator as

Oα

m = exph iπ

2 Xk֋m

σα

ki ,

(16)

where α = x, y, z and the summation is carried out along
all sites of the string, left from the m-th site. In case of
the chain model this is unambiguous and means k < m,
while for ladders or other models the path of the string
must be speciﬁed, as we discuss in the following sections.
The string order parameter (SOP) Oα is determined from
the limit n − m → ∞ of the string-string correlation
function

mOα

(17)

Taking m = 1 and n = 2l + 1 in (17) (note that SOP
for odd number of spins vanishes due to symmetry), the
SOP is introduced as

O2
α = lim
l→∞

(−1)lD

2l

Yk=1

σα

kE .

(18)

In the original proposal by den Nijs and Rommelse20 and
in the subsequent work on the spin chains (see, e.g.,21,22)
the SOP was identiﬁed (up to some minor variations)
with the limit of the string-string correlation function,
which is not convenient, since such SOP has a wrong di-
mension of square of the order parameter. The deﬁnition
we use here32 is more consistent with the standard theory
of critical phenomena and is in line with the deﬁnition of
the Landau order parameter via a correlation function of
local operators. We will show that in the critical region
Oα ∝ |t|β, where t is a distance from the critical point
and the critical index of the order parameter β correctly
enters all the hyperscaling relations.

Using the duality transformation (11) in Eq. (18) we

get

O2
x = lim
l→∞

(−1)l hτ x

0 τ x

2li .

(19)

So, the nonlocal SOP deﬁned on the sites of the direct
lattice becomes a local order parameter on the dual lat-
tice. This implies that for the phase transitions with
nonlocal orders the conventional Landau framework can
be recovered via duality.

According to the classical results41,42 for the 1D QIM

with the Hamiltonian

N

H =

Xi=1(cid:2)Jτ x

i τ x

i+1 + hτ z

i(cid:3) ,

the model is disordered at λ ≡ J/h ≤ 1, while the long-
range order mx 6= 0 appears at λ > 1. The order param-
eter is obtained from the correlation function:
l→∞(cid:10)τ x

i+l(cid:11) = (−1)l(cid:0)1 − λ−2(cid:1)

4 = (−1)lm2
x .

From comparison of the Hamiltonians (13,14,20) we see
that if λ♯ > 1, where

i τ x

(21)

lim

1

λe/o =

1 + γ ∓ δ
1 − γ ± δ

,

(22)

then τ x is ordered on either even or odd dual sublattices.
So we should distinguish between the even and odd SOP
deﬁned on the sites of the even or odd dual sublattices,
respectively. As one can see, the SOP deﬁned by Eq. (19)
is even, and we will denote it by Ox,e from now on. To de-
ﬁne the odd SOP (Ox,o) we can take m = 2 and n = 2l+2
in Eq. (17), then Ox,o is given by Eq. (19) where the cor-
relation function on its r.h.s is now hτ x
2l+1i. Using the
above formulas the even and odd SOP can be calculated
exactly:

1 τ x

Ox,e/o =( 21/4(cid:0)

0

t∓

(1+t∓)2(cid:1)1/8

t∓ ≥ 0
t∓ < 0

where we denote

t± = γ ± δ

(23)

(24)

Let us now calculate the y component of the SOP. The
duality transformations (11,12) with the interchange x ↔
y map the Hamiltonian (1) again onto a sum of two even
and odd QIM Hamiltonians:

Heven =

Hodd =

1

Xl=1(cid:0)J −+τ y

2l + J +−τ z

2l−1τ y

2l+1 + J ++τ z

(25)

2l(cid:1)
2l−1(cid:1) (26)

Following the same steps as above we easily ﬁnd:

Oy,e/o =(cid:26) 0

t∓ ≥ 0
Ox,e/o(−t∓) t∓ < 0

(27)

FIG. 1:
dimerized XY chain. Nonvanishing string and local order pa-
rameters, topological winding numbers are shown in four sec-
tors A,B,C,D of the (δ, γ) parametric plane. The violet/red
lines γ = ±δ are the lines of quantum phase transitions (gap-
lessness).

±δ divide the parameter plane into four regions denoted
by A-D. For each region we indicate nonvanishing order
parameters which characterize diﬀerent phases located
there.

The next important step in our analysis is to establish
relation between the conventional long-range order with
local order parameter(s) and the nonlocal (topological)
SOPs. Using the duality transformation (11) and de-
coupling of the dual Hamiltonian into the even and odd
terms, we ﬁnd the magnetization mx of the spins of the
original Hamiltonian (1) as:

m2

x = lim

l→∞hσx

1 σx

2li = lim

l→∞h(τ x

0 τ x

2l)(τ x

1 τ x

2l−1)i .

(28)

The y component of the magnetization can be treated in
a similar way, so we get

mα = Oα,oOα,e , α = x, y.

(29)

As we see from the model’s phase diagram in Fig. 1, the
even and odd SOPs are mutually exclusive in the regions
B and D. Those are the regions without conventional lo-
cal (Landau) order. The phases in the regions B and
D possess only a nonlocal (topological) order which is
quantiﬁed by the SOP. As we conclude from the dual-
ity mapping, the dimerized XY model (1) possesses the
hidden Z2 ⊗ Z2 symmetry which was also noticed ear-
lier in various spin chains and ladders.21 In the present
analytically solvable model the origin of such symmetry
can be easily traced to the Z2 symmetry of the even and
odd Ising models (13,14). Nonzero even SOP Ox,e and
odd SOP Ox,o in the sectors B and D are due to spon-
taneous breaking of the Z2 symmetry in the even (13)

e i or hτ x

or odd (14) sectors of the dual Hamiltonian, respectively.
These SOPs signal appearance of the spontaneous “dual”
magnetization hτ x
o i. We have to emphasize an im-
portant issue: since mappings of the original model (1)
onto the dual models (13,14) or (25,26) are results of the
diﬀerent dual transformations, the analyses in terms of
the SOP Ox or Oy are complimentary, and the order pa-
rameters Ox and Oy, even if they both are found to be
nonzero in some parts of the phase diagram should not
be understood as coexistent.

We conclude from Eqs. (23,27) (see also Fig. 1) that
contrary to common belief, the even and odd SOPs can
coexist.
In the region A of the phase diagram which
corresponds to γ2 > δ2, γ > 0 both even and odd
SOPs Ox,e/o are nonvanishing, and then, as follows from
Eq. (29) the local order (magnetization) mx 6= 0 ap-
pears in the original model (1). Similarly, when γ2 > δ2,
γ < 0 (region C of the phase diagram), the magnetization
my 6= 0. The appearance of the local order, or, equiva-
lently for this model, the coexistence of the even and odd
SOPs are the result of the spontaneous Z2⊗Z2 symmetry
breaking simultaneously in both even and odd sectors of
the dual Hamiltonian. From Eqs. (23,27,29) we ﬁnd the
numerical values of the local order parameters:

5

Ising universality class as it must, since the Hamiltonian
(1) is equivalent to free fermions.

C. Topological Winding Numbers

In recent years it has been proven that many quantum
phase transitions with hidden orders are accompanied by
a change of topological numbers3,13–18. In this section we
calculate the winding number (or the Pontryagin index)
in the dimerized XY spin chain to characterize its dif-
ferent gapped phases. These topological numbers were
calculated recently in similar 1D systems.17,43,44 Follow-
ing the formalism of Ref.[45] we ﬁrst rewrite (4) as the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian of the topological su-
perconductor (class DIII):

H(k) =(cid:18) ˆh(k)

ˆ∆†(k) −ˆh(k) (cid:19) ,

ˆ∆(k)

where

ˆh(k) ≡ J cos kσ1 + Jδ sin kσ2 + hσ3 ,
ˆ∆(k) ≡ −iJγ sin kσ1 .

(32)

(33)

(34)

.

(30)

By a unitary transformation the above Hamiltonian can
be brought to the block oﬀ-diagonal form

mx(γ) = my(−γ) = √2(cid:16)

γ2 − δ2

((1 + γ)2 − δ2)2(cid:17)1/8

In the limit δ = 0 the above equation coincides with the
result of Barouch and McCoy.42

Another useful limit of the model (1) is γ = 0 when
it becomes a dimerized XX chain. This model does not
have a local long-range order, and its phase diagram can
be read from the line γ = 0 in Fig. 1. The topological
order in the phases δ > 0 or δ < 0 is characterized by a
pair of mutually exclusive SOPs Oα,o and Oα,e (we can
choose α = x or α = y) separated by a quantum critical
point δ = 0 where all SOPs vanish. From (23,27) we ﬁnd

Ox,o = Oy,e = 21/4(cid:16)

δ

(1 + δ)2(cid:17)1/8

, δ > 0 .

(31)

The magnitudes of the SOPs are symmetric with respect
to δ and Ox,e(δ) = Oy,o(δ) = Ox,o(−δ) for δ < 0.
If we deﬁne a primary order parameter as the one
which is nonzero exclusively for a given phase, then we
can identify mx and my as the primary order parameters
for the magnetized phases residing, respectively, in the
sectors A and C of the phase diagram. The topological
order of the phases B and D is characterized by the pair
of the primary (string) parameters Ox,e and Ox,o for the
choice (11,12) of the dual transformation. (If we swap
x ↔ y, we end up with the dual representation where
the primary order parameters are Oy,e and Oy,o.) From
behavior of the gap (10) and the primary order param-
eter (cf. (23,27,30), whichever applicable) near the lines
γ = ±δ of the quantum phase transition we ﬁnd the crit-
ical indices ν = 1 and β = 1/8. So the critical behavior
of the model on the phase boundaries belongs to the 2D

˜H(k) =(cid:18) 0

ˆD(k)

with the operator

ˆD(k) = ˆh(k) + ˆ∆(k) ,

(35)

(36)

which has two eigenvalues ±λ(k) with
λ(k) = Jq(h/J)2 + 1 + (δ2 − γ2 − 1) sin2 k − iγ sin 2k .

(37)
Note a useful relation between the eigenvalues of ˆD(k),
ˆD†(k) and of the Hamiltonian (6):

ǫ+(k)ǫ−(k) = λ(k)λ∗(k)

(38)

In one spatial dimension the winding number deﬁned as45

N r

(39)

can be readily calculated analytically for this model. We
set h = 0 and calculated the winding number in all four
regions of the phase diagram in Fig. 1. To make a con-
nection between the deﬁnition (39) and a more intuitive
deﬁnition of the winding number let us introduce a two-
component unit vector n(k) = (n1(k), n2(k)) constructed
from the spectrum of the model. The eigenvalues (9) al-
low us to deﬁne two unit vectors with the components

n1(ǫ±(k)) = J cos k/ǫ±(k) ,
n2(ǫ±(k)) = J(δ ± γ) sin k/ǫ±(k) .

counts the number of loops wrapped by the unit vector
around the origin while the wavevector spans over the
Brillouin zone. One can show that

N r
w = N− − N+ =

2(cid:2)sign(δ − γ) − sign(δ + γ)(cid:3) .

(43)

The topological number N r
w accounts for the “relative”
winding of two normalized eigenvalues of the Hamilto-
nian. We ﬁnd the winding number Nw which adds up
the loops made by each of the eigenvectors more conve-
nient for various applications:

Nw = N− + N+ =

2(cid:2)sign(δ − γ) + sign(δ + γ)(cid:3) .

(44)

As one can see in Fig. 1 this number changes by ∆Nw =
±1 on the phase boundaries γ = ±δ, so Nw can be viewed
as a complimentary topological order parameter charac-
terizing a given phase. Nw = 0 in the topologically trivial

III. DIMERIZED TWO-LEG LADDER

A. Model and Eﬀective Mean-Field Hamiltonian

Now we present the results for a two-legged ladder with
intrinsic dimerization. In line with the earlier work23,30,37
we consider the two possible dimerization patterns of the
ladder: staggered and columnar, shown in Fig. 2. The

6

where the dimerization occurs along the chains (α = 1, 2)
only, with the rung coupling J⊥ taken as constant. All
the spin exchange couplings are antiferromagnetic. The
dimerization patterns are then deﬁned as:

Jα(n) = J[1 − (−1)n+αδ] (staggered)
Jα(n) = J[1 − (−1)nδ] (columnar)

(46)
(47)

with periodic boundary conditions along the chains and
open boundary conditions in the rung directions.

Critical properties of dimerized ladders are known from
analytical and numerical studies:9,23,25–31 the staggered
ladder can undergo a continuous quantum phase tran-
sition and is gapless on the line of quantum criticality,
while the columnar ladder is always gapped and does
not undergo any transition. We infer also from our ear-
lier work23,30 that the mean-ﬁeld approximation for this
model is quite adequate, even quantitatively. So we ap-
ply this approximation to map the spin ladder model
onto a problem of eﬀective quadratic fermionic Hamil-
tonian. The latter will be utilized to study analytically
the critical properties of two dimerizations, calculation
of SOPs and topological numbers, similarly to what was
done above for the exactly solvable chain.

We map the spin ladder Hamiltonian (45) onto
fermions via a JWT. There are diﬀerent ways to intro-
duce this transformation when we depart from a single-
chain problem (see, e.g., Refs.[12,46,47]). We chose the
snake-like path for the JWT used in47. Labelling the
sites of the ladder along the path as shown in Fig. 3, the
JWT is deﬁned as

Note that the coupling J⊥ spoils the commutation of

the phase as a good quantum number, i.e. ˆΦα(m) ≈
Φα(m). Then according to the Lieb theorem48 the
ground state of this quadratic Hamiltonian is in the π-
ﬂux phase,49 which amounts to

eiΦα(m) + 2tαk(m) = (−1)m+α−1(1 + 2tαk) .

The renormalization parameters tk and t⊥ must be deter-
mined self-consistently from minimization of the mean-
ﬁeld Hamiltonian (55).
In fact this was done before
in a slightly more sophisticated mean-ﬁeld treatment30
with t1k 6= t2k. (For earlier work on this mean-ﬁeld ap-
proach, see46.) The present mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian gives
essentially the same results for the ground state ener-
gies, eigenvalues, gaps, renormalization parameters, and
the phase diagram for the both staggered and columnar
ladders50 with some minor numerical diﬀerences. Keep-
ing in mind that the mean-ﬁeld parameters lie within
the range 0 ≤ (tk, t⊥) ≤ 1
2 for all possible values of the
Hamiltonian’s parameters,50 it suﬃces for the goals of
the present study to express results directly in terms of
JR and J⊥R. So in the following these renormalized cou-
plings are treated as free model parameters of the eﬀec-
tive Hamiltonian (55).

1. Staggered Ladder

To further simplify the eﬀective Hamiltonian (55)
one can perform a canonical transformation mapping
(−1)nc†
α(n)cα(n + 1). Introducing in-
stead of cα two distinct fermions residing on the even/odd
sites dα,e/o and Fourier transforming, we rewrite the
Hamiltonian as

α(n)cα(n + 1) 7→ c†

HMF = NC +Xk

where the spinor

2,o(k)(cid:17) ,

(59)

(60)

and the wavenumbers restricted to the Brillouin zone k ∈
[−π/2, π/2]. The 4 × 4 Hamiltonian of the staggered
phase can be written as

Hst(k) =

1
2

J⊥RΓ1 + JR cos kΓ3 + JRδ sin kΓ35 ,

(61)

where the Dirac matrices are deﬁned in (5) and Γ35 =
−1 ⊗ σ2. This Hamiltonian has four eigenvalues ±ǫ±
where

ǫ±(k) = JRrcos2 k +(cid:16)δ sin k ±

The spectrum has the gap

∆ = JR(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(63)

Similar to the dimerized XY chain, two relevant pertur-
bations cancel on the lines of quantum critical transition

J⊥R
2JR

= ±δ ,

(64)

where the staggered two-leg ladder becomes gapless.
From comparison of the eigenvalues of the ladder’s eﬀec-
tive Hamiltonian (62) and those of the XY chain in the
alternating transverse ﬁeld (6), we can infer the equiv-
alence between the spectra of those models, and even
match corresponding parameters:

Staggered ladder ⇐⇒ XY chain (1), δ = 0

1
2

JR ←→ J
J⊥R ←→ h
δ ←→ γ

Recall also that the fermionized Hamiltonian of the XY
chain is equivalent to a topological superconductor (32).
One can also establish equivalence and match parameters
of the eﬀective ladder Hamiltonian to those of the two-leg
Kitaev ladder12 or to the XY chain in a uniform trans-
verse ﬁeld and its dual model (for details of the latter, see
next subsection). This is hardly surprising since all these
models map onto quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians.

To calculate the topological winding number Nw in
diﬀerent phases of the staggered ladder we use a unitary
transformation to bring the Hamiltonian (61) to the block
diagonal form

8

We have shown the winding numbers for each phase on
the phase diagram of the staggered ladder in Fig. 4.
(Recall that we analyze the ladder with antiferromag-
netic couplings.) The complimentary order parameter
Nw changes by ∆Nw = ±1 on the phase boundaries
J⊥R/2JR = ±δ. The sectors (A) and (C) correspond
to the same topologically nontrivial phase.

and their eigenvalues are given by Eq.(62). Using the
eigenvalues (62) to yield the unit vector (40,41), we get

The 4 × 4 Hamiltonian of the columnar phase is
Hcol(k) =

and it has two two-fold degenerate eigenvalues ±ǫ where

Contrary to the staggered case, the columnar ladder is
always gapped with the gap

where we denote

κ ≡

(68)

One can check that N+ = N−. The result for the winding
number Nw can be cast in a simple form:

Nw = N− + N+ =

2(cid:2)sign(δ − κ) + sign(δ + κ)(cid:3) .

(69)

∆ = JRrδ2 +(cid:16) J⊥R
2JR(cid:17)2

,

(72)

and no phase transition occurs on the whole plane
(δ, J⊥R/2JR). As in the case of staggered dimerization,
from (6) and (71) we can establish equivalence between
the spectra of the eﬀective Hamiltonian of the columnar
ladder and the dimerized XY model in the alternating

transverse ﬁeld:

Columnar ladder ⇐⇒ XX chain (1), γ = 0

1
2

JR ←→ J
J⊥R ←→ h
δ ←→ δ

The columnar phase is trivial not only in the sense
that it is always gapped and noncritical, it is also triv-
ial topologically, since no integer winding number can be
assigned to this phase.
Indeed, if we identify the op-
posite ends of the Brillouin zone, then the wavenum-
ber k is deﬁned in the space equivalent to the one-
dimensional sphere S1. This is also the space spanned
by the two-component unit vector (40,41) of the stag-
gered phase. The nontrivial winding number for that
phase corresponds to the homotopy group π1(S1) = Z.
As one can see from (71) the analogous unit vector is
three-component in the columnar phase, and it spans the
space S2. The corresponding homotopy group is trivial
π1(S2) = 0 and no integer winding number exists, since
any closed loop on the sphere S2 can be shrunk.51

The QIM with the three-spin interactions (78) in the even
sector of the Hamiltonian is discussed in the Appendix.
The odd sector (79) is the XY model in the transverse
ﬁeld with the anisotropy parameter γ = 1/δ.

In our earlier work23 we took the deﬁnition of the SOP
for ladders which was proposed by Kim and coworkers8
and used also in other works.9 In this paper the ladder
SOP is calculated via the string-string correlation func-
tion as deﬁned in Sec. II. One can check that our SOP is
proportional to the SOP of Kim and other workers, but
it is given by a simpler analytical formula. The even and
odd SOPs deﬁned below have a clear connection to the

even/odd sectors (78,79) of the Hamiltonian.

To calculate the ﬁrst SOP we deﬁne the string operator
(16) along the path shown in Fig. 3. In so doing we obtain
the even SOP:

Note that the string chosen allows to incorporate in prin-

us now choose another string for the operator (16) shown

in Fig. 5. In such case we obtain the odd SOP:

FIG. 5: String used to deﬁne the odd SOP for the two-leg

We calculated the order parameter of the three-spin

sented there, we obtain:

Ox,e =( (cid:2) κ2−δ2

|κ/δ| ≥ 1
|κ/δ| < 1

Ox,o =( 0

q 2
1+δ(cid:2)δ2 − κ2(cid:3)1/8

|κ/δ| > 1
|κ/δ| ≤ 1

(83)

In agreement with earlier results8,9,23 we ﬁnd that the
even and odd SOPs are mutually exclusive. They de-
tect hidden Z2 ⊗ Z2 symmetry breaking21 and ordering
in the even or odd sectors of the dual Hamiltonian. Note
that contrary to its even counterpart, the string for the
odd SOP misses two sites at the opposite ends of the
ladder. The order probed by Ox,o is topologically non-
trivial, since it corresponds to nonzero winding numbers.
According to conventional wisdom,13 there are zero Ma-
jorana modes at the ladder’s ends in this phase. We
indicate the order parameters on the phase diagram of
the staggered ladder in Fig. 4. From the behavior of the
gap (63) and SOPs (82,83) near the lines of phase tran-
sitions J⊥R/2JR = ±δ we ﬁnd the critical indices ν = 1
and β = 1/8 of the 2D Ising universality class, but now
their values are the artifact of the eﬀective free-fermionic
approximation.

Analysis of the columnar phase is done similarly. The
sites of the columnar ladder are labelled along the JWT
path in Fig. 3. The Majorana representation of the
columnar Hamiltonian (55) can be mapped via transfor-
mations (76,77) onto dual spins. Again the dual Hamilto-
nian splits into even and odd sectors H col = H col
o + H col
,
where the odd term is the Hamiltonian of the dimerized
XX (γ = 0) chain in the alternating ﬁeld (1), while the
even term corresponds to its dual model which is the Ising
chain in the alternating transverse ﬁeld with the three-
spin interactions. Since these models are always gapped
(cf. Eq. (72)) and do not undergo any phase transitions,

e

we will not discuss the properties of the columnar phase
in more detail.

10

Note a very remarkable property of the eﬀective Hamil-
tonian (55): for both dimerization patterns it decouples
into the reciprocally dual even and odd sectors H st/col =
H st/col
, i.e. these Hamiltonians map onto each
e
other H st/col
under the duality transformation
(11,12).

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work we studied quantum phase transitions in
the antiferromagnetic dimerized spin- 1
2 XY chain and
two-leg ladders. The common feature of these models
is a subtle interplay of relevant perturbations each of
which results in a gap creation in the spectrum. There
are however lines of quantum criticality where those per-
turbations cancel and the models become gapless. We
analyzed the properties of the diﬀerent phases of these
models.

The dimerized XY chain is equivalent to the nonin-
teracting fermions and is mapped by a duality transfor-
mation onto two 1D QIMs residing separately on even
and odd sites of the dual lattice. The SOPs for the
original chain are mapped onto the local (Landau) or-
der parameters of these dual QIMs and thus calculated
exactly. As follows from the duality mapping, the dimer-
ized XY model possesses the hidden Z2 ⊗ Z2 symmetry,
and nonzero SOPs are due to spontaneous breaking of
the Z2 symmetry in the even or odd sectors of the dual
Hamiltonian.

The phase diagram of the model contains topologically
trivial phases where the even and odd SOPs coexist along
with the conventional long-range order (magnetization).
There are also topologically nontrivial phases without
conventional order where only the even or odd nonlocal
SOPs exist. In addition the winding numbers are calcu-
lated. Their values are consistent with the topologically
trivial or nontrivial nature of each phase.

Fermionization of the dimerized two-leg ladders was
followed up by a mean-ﬁeld approximation. The result-
ing Hamiltonian was then treated as a new eﬀective free-
fermionic model. The predictions of this eﬀective Hamil-
tonian for the critical properties and phase diagram of the
ladders with the staggered or columnar dimerizations are
in agreement to what is known from earlier work. From
the Majorana representation of the eﬀective Hamiltonian
we constructed its transformation to new dual spins. The
staggered eﬀective Hamiltonian maps onto the sum of the
decoupled even and odd dual exactly-solvable Hamilto-
nians. The even term is the quantum Ising chain with
three-spin interaction, while the odd term is the XY
chain in a uniform transverse ﬁeld. Interestingly, the even
and odd sectors map onto each other under the duality
transformations. The SOPs of the original spin ladders
are calculated as the local order parameters in the dual
models. We deﬁned two mutually exclusive (even and

odd) SOPs which detect breaking of the hidden Z2 ⊗ Z2
ladder symmetry. One of those SOPs probes topologi-
cally trivial phase, while another corresponds to the topo-
logically nontrivial phase. This statement is also corrobo-
rated by the calculation of the winding numbers for those
phases. Similar mappings and dualities are found for the
columnar dimerized ladder, but this case is not very in-
teresting, since the columnar ladder is always gapped and
does not undergo phase transitions.

Our main result is the framework to treat nonlocal
orders and hidden symmetries which uniﬁes the key el-
ements of the Landau paradigm with the new concept
of topological order. This uniﬁed framework can be
straightforwardly applied for such important physical
systems as spin chain and ladders, topological insulators
and superconductors. As we have shown throughout our
analysis, the fermionic Hamiltonians (exact or eﬀective)
we used for the chain or ladder models are equivalent
to tight-binding Hamiltonians of topological materials.
To probe the topological order in the latter one needs
the Majorana string operators which can be straightfor-
wardly mapped onto the local parameters via the duality
transformations we applied here.

We are currently working on applying this theory for
the Heisenberg spin- 1
2 tubes. Another interesting devel-
opments of the proposed formalism would be its exten-
sion for the exotic thermal phases in classical spin mod-
els, as, e.g., the algebraically-ordered topological ﬂoating
phase occurring in some frustrated 2D Ising models.58,59

the complex plane, the conditions for Szeg¨o’s theorem
are satisﬁed56, and it can be applied for calculation of
the limit N → ∞ of the Toeplitz determinant ˜DN . The
latter result is well known and reads:56

The above formula for magnetization is analytic in the
whole locally ordered range (A7) across the line h = J3.
The validity of the formula for the order parameter (A17)
was checked by direct numerical calculation of the deter-
minant (A12) using Mathematica.
