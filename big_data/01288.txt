OPTION SPANNING BEYOND Lp-MODELS

N. GAO AND F. XANTHOS

Abstract. The aim of this paper is to study the spanning power

of options in a static ﬁnancial market that allows non-integrable

assets. Our ﬁndings extend and unify the results in [8, 9, 18] for

Lp-models. We also apply the spanning power properties to the

pricing problem.

In particular, we show that prices on call and

put options of a limited liability asset can be uniquely extended by

arbitrage to all marketed contingent claims written on the asset.

1. Introduction

Throughout this paper, Ω stands for the state space of a ﬁnancial

market, Σ stands for the σ-algebra modelling the market information

structure, and P stands for a probability over (Ω, Σ). The space of
ﬁnancial assets, X, is modelled as an ideal (i.e. solid subspace) of L0(Ω)
containing the constants. An element in X is called an asset, and the

constant functions represent riskless assets. An asset displays limited

liabilities if it is positive. For a limited liability asset f , its option space

is the collection of all portfolios of call and put options written on f ,

which can be identiﬁed as follows:

Of = Span(cid:8)1, (f − k)+ : k ∈ R(cid:9).

The space of all contingent claims written on f is identiﬁed as the space

of all functions measurable with respect to σ(f ), i.e.

L0(σ(f )).

A stream of research has been devoted to the study of spanning

power of options on f , i.e. the size of Of . In the seminal paper [22],
Ross showed that if the state space Ω is ﬁnite then the options on f

span the space of contingent claims written on f , i.e.

Of = L0(σ(f )),

and if, in addition, f is one-to-one, then the option space of f completes

the market, i.e.

Of = L0(Ω).

These elegant results of Ross’ have inspired many successive contribu-

tions to the study of options. See e.g. [4, 14, 16] for related results

on ﬁnite state spaces. In particular, they have also been examined for

ﬁnancial markets with inﬁnite state spaces

Nachman proved in [18] that if X = Lp(Ω) (1 ≤ p < ∞), then
the options on f span the space of contingent claims written on the

asset in two ways: approximating by a.e. convergence or by p-th mean
convergence. Precisely, it was proved that an asset x ∈ Lp(Ω) is a
contingent claim on f ∈ Lp(Ω) iﬀ there exists a sequence of portfolios of
options on f converging a.e. to x iﬀ there exists a sequence of portfolios

of options on f converging in the p-th mean to x. That is,

a.e.

Galvani ([8]) and Galvani and Troitsky ([9]) proved further that if Ω is

a Polish space equipped with the Borel σ-algebra and f is one-to-one
and bounded, then Of completes the market X = Lp(Ω) (1 ≤ p ≤ ∞).
That is, for 1 ≤ p < ∞,

In this paper, we explore the spanning power of options in general

ﬁnancial markets. Our contributions here are two-fold. Firstly, ﬁ-
nancial markets in our setting can be modelled as any ideal of L0(Ω)
which contains the constant functions (riskless assets) and admits a

strictly positive order continuous functional. This framework includes
not only the Lp-space (1 ≤ p ≤ ∞) models, but also the much wider
class of Orlicz space models as well as non-integrable space models

which have been extensively used in the theory of risk measures (see

e.g. [6, 7, 11, 19])

Secondly, we provide an approach to unify the norm and w∗-topologies
used in the results of Nachman, Galvani and Troitsky, and thus give

more comprehensive insight into the general structures of option spaces;

see Theorem 3.1 and Remark 3.3. The uniﬁcation in our approach is
due to the use of the topology σ(X, X ∼
n is the set of all
order continuous functionals on X.

n ), where X ∼

Observe that the topology σ(X, X ∼

n ) has a natural connection with
pricing. Recall that a pricing φ on X is given by a state-price density

y via integration, i.e.

φ(x) =ZΩ

xy dP for all x ∈ X,

where y is measurable and satisﬁes RΩ|xy|dP < ∞ for all x ∈ X. By

Dominated Convergence Theorem, it is easily seen that each pricing is

an order continuous functional on X. Conversely, by Radon-Nikodym

theorem, one can easily see that each order continuous functional on
X has a density, and thus is a pricing on X. Therefore, X ∼
n is just the
pricing system on X.

Because of this link, we are able to apply Theorem 3.1 and shed

light on the following general problem, raised in [5]: “Under what cir-

cumstances can prices on the marketed assets or basic derivative assets

4

N. GAO AND F. XANTHOS

be uniquely extended by arbitrage to prices on all derivative assets in

a large class and when is such an extension unique?”In Theorem 3.4,

we prove that when the arbitrage condition is understood as a no-free
lunch condition (see [15]), one can extend uniquely the prices on Of to
the marketed contingent claims written on f .

2. Preliminary results

We refer to [1, 2] for all unexplained terminology and standard facts

on vector and Banach lattices. A vector subspace Y of a vector lattice
X is called a solid subspace or an ideal of X, if |x| ≤ |y| and y ∈ Y
imply x ∈ Y . A functional φ on a vector lattice X is said to be order
o−→ 0 in X. The collection of
continuous if φ(xα) → 0 whenever xα
all order continuous functionals on X is denoted by X ∼
n and is called
the order continuous dual of X. A functional φ on X is said to
be positive if φ(x) ≥ 0 whenever x ≥ 0, and is said to be strictly

positive if φ(x) > 0 whenever x > 0.

The following lemma will be used. Recall ﬁrst that a vector lattice is

said to be order complete (or Dedekind complete) if every order

bounded above subset has a supremum, and is said to have the count-

able super property if any subset having a supremum possesses a

countable subset with the same supremum. A subset A of a vector
lattice X is said to be order closed if x ∈ A whenever there exists a
net (aα) in A such that aα

o−→ x in X.

Lemma 2.1. Let X be an order complete vector lattice with the count-

able sup property and Y be a sublattice of X. Then Y is order closed

in X iﬀ for any increasing sequence in Y which is order bounded above

in X, its supremum in X also lies in Y .

Given a probability space (Ω, Σ, P), for any real-valued measurable

function f , denote by [f ] the class of all real-valued measurable func-

tions which are almost everywhere equal to f , and call f a representa-
tive of the class [f ]. Following the convention, we use L0(Ω) to denote

OPTION SPANNING BEYOND Lp-MODELS

5

the collection of all such classes. In some literature, the symbols, f and

[f ], are used interchangeably. But unlike in [18, 8, 9], we will strictly

distinguish them in this paper, for technical accuracy. We use 1 to de-
note the class containing the constant one function. Recall that L0(Ω)
is a vector lattice if endowed with the order: [f ] ≤ [g] iﬀ f (ω) ≤ g(ω)
for a.e. ω ∈ Ω. In fact, we have the following linear and lattice opera-
tions in L0(Ω): a[f ] + b[g] = [af + bg] and [f ] ∧ [g] = [f ∧ g].

By [17, Lemma 2.6.1], it is easily seen that any ideal of L0(Ω) is
order complete and has the countable sup property. Hence, Lemma 2.1
is applicable to them. Recall also that [fn] o−→ 0 in an ideal X of L0(Ω)
if and only if fn
n=1 is order bounded in X, i.e. there
exists [f ] ∈ X such that |fn| ≤ f a.e. for each n ≥ 1. Note that the
class of ideals of L0(Ω) which admit strictly positive order continuous
functionals is very large. For example, by [10, Proposition 5.19], all

a.e.−−→ 0 and ([fn])∞

Banach function spaces (i.e. Banach ideal spaces), including all Orlicz
spaces, in particular, all Lp-spaces, are as such.

For a subset Y of L0(Ω), deﬁne σ(Y ) to be the smallest σ-algebra
with respect to which f is measurable whenever [f ] ∈ Y . For a sub-σ-
algebra G of Σ, denote by L0(G) the set of all those classes in L0(Ω)
which have a representative measurable with respect to G. The follow-

ing result is an improved and generalized market completeness theorem

in the sense of Green and Jarrow ([12, Theorem 1]).

Lemma 2.2. Let X be an ideal of L0(Ω) and Y a sublattice of X such
that 1 ∈ Y . Then the following are equivalent

(a) Y is order closed in X,
(b) Y = L0(σ(Y )) ∩ X.

The following result, which is of independent interest, is a version of

the Kreps-Yan theorem.

Proposition 2.3. Let X be a Banach function space in L0(Ω). Then

the Kreps-Yan theorem holds true for(cid:0)X, σ(X, X ∼

n )(cid:1). That is, for each

6

N. GAO AND F. XANTHOS

n )-closed cone C in X such that C ⊃ −X+ and C ∩ X+ = {0},

σ(X, X ∼
there exists a strictly positive functional φ ∈ X ∼

n such that φ|C ≤ 0.

The proof of this result (see Section 4) relies on [13, Theorem 3.1].

For more results on this direction, we refer the reader to [20, 21].

3. Main results

In this section, a ﬁnancial market is always modelled as an ideal
of L0(Ω) over a given probability space (Ω, Σ, P) that contains the
riskless asset 1 and admits a strictly positive order continuous pricing

functional. For a measurable function f , denote by σ(f ) the smallest

σ-algebra with respect to which f is measurable.

Our ﬁrst main result is as follows.

Theorem 3.1. Let X be a ﬁnancial market and [f ] be a limited liability
asset in X. For an asset [g] ∈ X, the following are equivalent:

(a) [g] is a contingent claim written on [f ], i.e. [g] ∈ L0(σ(f )) ∩ X,
(b) [g] can be approximated by portfolios of options on [f ] in the

σ(X, X ∼

n )-topology, i.e. [g] ∈ O[f ]

σ(X,X ∼
n )

,

(c) There exists a sequence ([gn]) in O[f ] such that gn

a.e.−−→ g.

The following corollary is immediate. Recall ﬁrst that an asset in

X is called an eﬃcient fund of X if it determines the information

structure Σ, i.e. it has a representative f such that σ(f ) = Σ.

Corollary 3.2. Let [f ] be an eﬃcient fund of a ﬁnancial market X

that displays limited liability. Then we have the following:

(a) The option space of [f ] completes the market in the σ(X, X ∼

n )-

topology, i.e. O[f ]

σ(X,X ∼
n )

= X,

(b) The option space of [f ] completes the market by approximating
via a.e. convergence, i.e. for any [g] ∈ X, there exists a sequence
([gn]) in O[f ] such that gn

a.e.−−→ g.

Remark 3.3. Note that our Theorem 3.1 and Corollary 3.2 imply uni-
formly the aforementioned results1 of Nachman, Galvani and Troitsky.
Indeed, recall ﬁrst that, for 1 ≤ p < ∞, X = Lp(Ω) is order con-
tinuous, i.e. xα ↓ 0 in X implies kxαk ↓ 0.
In this case, one has
n = X ∗, so that σ(X, X ∼
X ∼
n ) is just the weak topology on X. Thus, by
σ(X,X ∼
n )
for any convex subset C of

Mazur’s theorem, C

k·k

w

= C

= C

X. Consequently, it follows that

O[f ]

σ(X,X ∼
n )

= O[f ]

k·kp.

Now it is clear that Equation (1) follows from Theorem 3.1. If, in addi-

tion, Ω is a Polish space with Σ being the Borel algebra, and f is one-to-

one, then it is easily seen that σ(f ) = Σ by [3, Theorem 12.29]. Thus,

Equation (2) follows from Corollary 3.2. Equation (3) also follows from
Corollary 3.2, since L∞(Ω)∼
n ) is
just the w∗-topology.

n = L1(Ω) and thus σ(L∞(Ω), L∞(Ω)∼

We now turn to discuss the pricing problem. Our notation and ter-

minology are in accordance with [15, 23].

Let [f ] be a ﬁxed asset in X and π be a positive functional on the
option space M := O[f ], which is interpreted as pricing on M. We
denote by M0 := {x ∈ M | π(x) = 0} the set of all portfolios of options
on [f ] that can be bought or sold with zero price. We say that (M, π)

admits no free lunches (cf. [23, Deﬁnition 1.3]), if the following holds

C ∩ X+ = {0}, where C = M0 − X+

σ(X,X ∼
n )

.

We say that a price, p, of an asset [g] ∈ X is consistent with (M, π)
if there exists a strictly positive functional x∗ ∈ X ∼
n such that x∗|M = π
and x∗([g]) = p ([15, Deﬁnition, pp. 29]). The price of [g] ∈ X is said
to be determined by arbitrage from (M, π) if there is a single price

p for [g] that is consistent with (M, π) ([15, Deﬁnition, pp. 30]).

Our second main result is as follows.

1Recall that, unlike in [18, 8, 9], we distinguish f and [f ] in this paper.

8

N. GAO AND F. XANTHOS

Theorem 3.4. Let X be a ﬁnancial market, which is a Banach func-
tion space in L0(Ω). Let [f ] be a limited liability asset in X and π be
a positive linear functional on the option space M = O[f ]. If (M, π)
admits no free lunches, then the price of any marketed claim [g] written
on [f ] (i.e. [g] ∈ L0(σ(f )) ∩ X) is determined by arbitrage from (M, π).

4. Proofs of Results

Proof of Lemma 2.1. Let (yn) be an increasing sequence in Y that is
order bounded above in X. Since X is order complete, it follows that
(yn) has a supremum, x, in X. Since (yn) is increasing, it follows that
o−→ x in X. Thus, if Y is order closed in X, then x ∈ Y . This proves
yn
the “only if” part.

For the “if” part, observe ﬁrst that, in this case, for any sequence

zn = Wn

(yn) in Y which is order bounded in X, its supremum and inﬁmum in
X also lie in Y . Indeed, denote by x the supremum of (yn) in X. Put
k=1 yk. Then zn ∈ Y as Y is a sublattice of X, and moreover,
the supremum of (zn) in X is still x. Since (zn) is increasing, it follows
from the “if” assumption that x ∈ Y . Replacing (yn) with (−yn),
one sees easily that the inﬁmum of (yn) in X also lies in Y . Now let
o−→ x in X. By passing to a tail,
(yα) ⊂ Y and x ∈ X be such that yα
we may assume that (yα) is order bounded in X. Then since X is order
complete, we have

inf
α

sup
β≥α

|yβ − x| = 0,

where all the suprema and inﬁma are taken in X. By the countable sup
property of X, we can choose {αn}∞
n=1 such that inf n supβ≥αn|yβ − x| =
0. Without loss of generality, we can assume that (αn) is increasing.
It follows that

inf

sup
m≥n

|yαm − x| = 0,

o−→ x, so that x = inf n supm≥n yαm; cf. [3, Theorem
or equivalently, yαn
8.16]. Applying the preceding observation to the suprema and then to
the inﬁmum, we obtain that x ∈ Y .

Proof of Lemma 2.2. Assume ﬁrst (b) holds. Let ([fn]) be an increasing
sequence in Y and [f ] be its supremum in X. Then fn ↑ f a.e. Denote
by E the set of points where (fn) is convergent. Since each fn is σ(Y )-
measurable, we have that E ∈ σ(Y ), and Ω\E has measure 0. Deﬁne
f ′ by f ′(ω) = limn fn(ω) for ω ∈ E and f ′(ω) = 0 for ω 6∈ E. Again,
since each fn is σ(Y )-measurable, it is easily seen that f ′ is also σ(Y )-
measurable, and consequently, [f ] = [f ′] ∈ L0(σ(Y )). Now in view of
the fact that X is order complete and has the countable sup property,

Lemma 2.1 implies that (a) holds.

Conversely, assume that (a) holds. We ﬁrst claim that σ(Y ) =(cid:8)A ∈
Σ : [χA] ∈ Y(cid:9)2. Denote the right hand side by G. We ﬁrst show that

k=1Ak] = Wn
k=1Ak] in X, it follows that [S∞

it is a σ-algebra. Indeed, it is clear that ∅ ∈ G, and that if A ∈ G,
then [χAc] = 1 − [χA] ∈ Y , so that Ac ∈ G. Now let (Ak)∞
1 be a
k=1[χAk] ∈ Y , and from
sequence of sets in G. Then [χ∪n
k=1 Ak] ∈ Y , since Y is
[χ∪n
k=1 Ak ∈ G. This concludes the proof of
that G is a σ-algebra. Next, we show that each f with [f ] ∈ Y is
measurable with respect to G. Indeed, for any real number r, it follows
from Y ∋ [n(f − r)+] ∧ 1 ↑ [χ{f >r}] in X that [χ{f >r}] ∈ Y , so that
{f > r} ∈ G, and f is G-measurable. Therefore, σ(Y ) ⊂ G. The

k=1Ak] ↑ [χ∪∞

order closed. Therefore, S∞

reverse inclusion being clear, this completes the proof of the claim.

It is clear that Y ⊂ L0(σ(Y )) ∩ X. For the reverse inclusion, take
[f ] ∈ L0(σ(Y ))∩X. By selecting an appropriate representative, we may
assume that f is measurable respect to σ(Y ). By considering [f ]±, we
may assume that f is non-negative. Then we can ﬁnd a sequence (fn) of
simple functions which are measurable with respect to σ(Y ) such that
fn ↑ f everywhere, so that [fn] ↑ [f ] in X. By the preceding claim, we
have that [fn] ∈ Y . Therefore, [f ] ∈ Y , and thus L0(σ(Y )) ∩ X ⊂ Y .
It follows that Y = L0(σ(Y )) ∩ X.
(cid:3)

2This is essentially contained in [12, Theorem 1].

Proof of Theorem 3.1. We claim that O[f ] is a sublattice of X. Indeed,

put Z = Span(cid:8)b, s, (s − kb)+ : k ∈ R(cid:9), where b = [f ] + 1 and s = [f ].

Note that X is an order complete space as an ideal of L0(µ) and thus
it is uniformly complete (cf. [1, Lemma 1.56]). By [5, Theorem (1)], it
follows that Z is a sublattice of X. Now simply observe that Z = O[f ].
Indeed, the inclusion O[f ] ⊂ Z is immediate as [f ], 1 ∈ Z and Z is
closed under lattice operations. For the reverse inclusion, note that for
k ≥ 1 we have (s − kb)+ = 0, and for k < 1 we have (s − kb)+ =
(1 − k)([f ] − k
1−k

1)+ ∈ O[f ].

Assume that (c) holds. Since Z is a sublattice of X, by considering
the positive and negative parts, respectively, we may assume that g ≥ 0
a.e.−−→ gk ∧ g and
and gn ≥ 0 for all n. For any k ≥ 1, since gk ∧ gn
([gk ∧ gn])n is order bounded in X, it follows that [gk ∧ gn] o−→ [gk ∧ g]
in X, and therefore, [gk ∧ gn]

σ(X,X ∼
n )
−−−−−→ [gk ∧ g]. Hence,

[gk ∧ g] ∈ Z

σ(X,X ∼

for any k ≥ 1. Now gk ∧ g
we have [gk ∧ g] o−→ [g] in X, so that [gk ∧ g]

σ(X,X ∼

This proves that (c)⇒(b).

Suppose now (b) holds.

It follows from [2, Theorem 3.50] that
the dual of X under the topology |σ|(X, X ∼

fore, by Mazur’s theorem (cf. [2, Theorem 3.13]), since Z is convex,

This contradiction concludes the proof of (b)⇒(c).

Now put Y = Z

σ(X,X ∼

. Then Y is clearly order closed in X. More-

over, by the preceding paragraph, Y = Z

|σ|(X,X ∼

, implying that it

is also a sublattice of X by [2, Theorem 3.46]. Thus by Lemma 2.2,
Y = L0(σ(Y )) ∩ X. Since [f ] ∈ Y , it is clear that σ(Y ) ⊃ σ(f ), so that

Y = L0(σ(Y )) ∩ X ⊃ L0(σ(f )) ∩ X.

For the reverse inclusion, note that for each [g] ∈ O[f ], one can choose
g measurable with respect to σ(f ). Thus, for an arbitrary [g] ∈ Y ,
we can take, by the implication (b)⇒(c), a sequence ([gn]) in O[f ] such
a.e.−−→ g. As in
that each gn is measurable with respect to σ(f ) and gn
the proof of Lemma 2.2, we can take a real-valued function g′ such that
g′ is σ(f )-measurable and [g] = [g′] ∈ L0(σ(f )) ∩ X. It follows that

Y ⊂ L0(σ(f )) ∩ X,

and hence Y = L0(σ(f )) ∩ X. This proves (a)⇔(b).

Proof of Proposition 2.3. It suﬃces to show that (cid:0)X, σ(X, X ∼

ﬁes the Assumptions (C) and (L) in [13, Theorem 3.1]. It is clear that
Assumption (C) is satisﬁed as X ∼
n is a Banach space. We now proceed
to verify that Assumption (L) is also satisﬁed. That is, we want to
prove that any family {x∗

{x∗

n )(cid:1) satis-

x∗
γn([f ]) = 0 for all n ≥ 1 implies x∗

γ([f ]) = 0 for all γ ∈ Γ.

We begin with an observation from measure theory: Any collection
{Aγ}γ∈Γ of measurable sets admit a subcollection {Aγn}n≥1 such that

P Aγ\[n≥1

Aγn! = 0, for any γ ∈ Γ.

(∗)

have F ′ ∈ F , so that δ ≥ P(AF ′) = P(AF0) + P(Aγ\AF0) > δ, since

Indeed, let F be the collection of all countable subsets of Γ. For each
P(AF ). Take Fn ∈ F
n=1 Fn. Then F0 ∈ F , and thus
δ ≥ P(AF0) ≥ P(AFn) ↑ δ, implying that P(AF0) = δ. Writing F0 =
{γn}n≥1, we get the desired subcollection {Aγn}n≥1. Indeed, otherwise,

F ∈ F , put AF := Sγ∈F Aγ. Put δ := supF ∈F
such that P(AFn) ↑ δ. Put F0 := S∞
P(cid:0)Aγ\Sn≥1 Aγn(cid:1) > 0 for some γ ∈ Γ. Putting F ′ := F0 ∪ {γ}, we
AF0 =Sn=1 Aγn. The proves the observation.

Now for the given family {x∗

Then [f ] ⊥ Cγn, so that [f ] ⊥ [χAγn ] = 0.

It follows that P(cid:0){f >

Proof of Theorem 3.4. It is clear that C := M0 − X+
closed cone with −X+ ⊂ C and C ∩ X+ = {0} because of no free
lunches. Thus by Proposition 2.3, there exists a strictly positive func-
tional x∗ ∈ X ∼
n such that x∗|C ≤ 0. This last condition implies that
x∗|M0 = 0, so that ker π = M0 ⊂ ker(x∗|M ). Hence, there exists
λ > 0 such that π = λx∗|M . Therefore, for each [g] ∈ L0(σ(f )) ∩ X =
