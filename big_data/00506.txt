Abstract

We compute the asymptotics of the determinants of certain n× n Toeplitz + Hankel
matrices Tn(a) + Hn(b) as n → ∞ with symbols of Fisher-Hartwig type. More specif-
ically we consider the case where a has zeros and poles and where b is related to a in
speciﬁc ways. Previous results of Deift, Its and Krasovsky dealt with the case where a
is even. We are generalizing this in a mild way to certain non-even symbols.

Introduction

For many recent applications, an asymptotic formula for determinants of the sum of ﬁnite
Toeplitz and Hankel matrices has been of interest. For example, if we let a be in L1(T) and
denote the kth Fourier coeﬃcients of a by ak then understanding the behavior of

det (aj−k + aj+k+1)j,k=0,...,n−1

as n → ∞ is important in random matrix theory. It has been shown in [5] that the above
determinant behaves asymptotically like GnE with certain explicitly given constants G and

E if a is a suﬃciently well-behaved function. Such a result is an analogue of the classical
Szeg¨o-Widom limit theorem [17] for Toeplitz determinants.

The above determinant is a special case of more general determinants,

det (aj−k + bj+k+1)j,k=0,...,n−1,

where both a and b are in L1(T). We refer to the functions a and b as symbols. The goal
is to ﬁnd the asymptotics in the case of well-behaved a and b and also for the singular
Fisher-Hartwig type symbols (symbols, with say, jump discontinuities or zeros). While an
asymptotic formula in such a general case (with explicit description of the constants) is
probably not doable, much recent progress has been made in some special cases.

To be more precise a Fisher-Hartwig symbol is one of the form

a(eiθ) = c(eiθ)

RYr=1

vτr,αr (eiθ)uτr,βr(eiθ)

(1)

where c is a suﬃciently well-behaved function (i.e., suﬃciently smooth, nonvanishing, and
with winding number zero) and for τ = eiφ,

uτ,β(eiθ) = exp(iβ(θ − φ − π)),
vτ,α(eiθ) = (2 − 2 cos(θ − φ))α.

0 < θ − φ < 2π,

The symbol uτ,β has a jump at the point τ on the unit circle and the function vτ.α can be
singular (say if α has negative real part,) or be zero at τ . We will generally refer to this last
factor as having a singularity of “zero” type. Furthermore, αr and βr are complex parameters
(where we assume Re αr > −1/2) and τ1, . . . , τR are distinct points on the unit circle T.

In the case of smooth symbols, we cite the results in [7] where the case of

det (aj−k + bj+k+1)j,k=0,...,n−1

with b(eiθ) = ±eiℓθa(eiθ) and ℓ ﬁxed is considered. It is worth mentioning that among those
cases, there are four special cases of particular interest,

(i) b(eiθ) = a(eiθ),

(ii) b(eiθ) = −a(eiθ),

(iii) b(eiθ) = eiθa(eiθ),

(iv) b(eiθ) = −e−iθa(eiθ),

2

in which the asymptotics have the form GnE with non-zero E. In the case of even symbols,
i.e., a(eiθ) = a(e−iθ), these four cases are also related to the random matrices taken from the
classical groups [2, 14]. Furthermore, these Toeplitz+Hankel determinants are expressable
as Hankel determinants as well.

In the case of b = a, two earlier papers of the authors consider the case of jump
discontinuities [5, 6]. Furthermore, in the above four cases where in addition a is even, the
results of Deift, Its, and Krasovsky [12] are quite complete and impressive. They allow quite
general Fisher-Hartwig symbols with both zeros and jumps. In [12] the asymptotics are of
the form

Gn np E

where G, p, and E are explicitly given constants. However, none of the earlier mentioned
papers cover the case where the symbol is allowed to be non-even and with singularities of
the zero type. So this is the focus of this paper, a non-even symbol with certain speciﬁed
types of Fisher-Hartwig symbols. We prove an asymptotic formula of the same form as
above. This is a step in the ultimate goal of asymptotics for non-even symbols with general
Fisher-Hartwig singularitites.

In order to brieﬂy sketch the main ideas of the paper, let T (a) and H(b) stand for
the Toeplitz and Hankel operators with symbols a and b acting on ℓ2, and let Pn stand
for the ﬁnite section projection on ℓ2. The precise deﬁnition of these operators will be
given in the next section. The above determinants can be understood as the determinant
of Pn(T (a) + H(b))Pn for certain symbols a, b of Fisher-Hartwig type. Since we will allow
not only for jumps, but also for zeros and poles the underlying operator (or its inverse) is
generally not bounded. Hence the ﬁrst step is to reformulate the problem as one which
involves only bounded operators. This will be done by establishing an identity of the kind

det Pn(T (a) + H(b))Pn = det(cid:16)PnT −1(ψ)(T (c) + H(cdφ))T −1(ψ−1)Pn(cid:17)

(2)

where the functions c and d are smooth and φ and ψ have only jump discontinuities. The
next major step is a separation theorem, which allows to “remove” the smooth functions c
and d, i.e.,

det(cid:16)PnT −1(ψ)(T (c) + H(cdφ))T −1(ψ−1)Pn(cid:17)
det(cid:16)PnT −1(ψ)(I + H(φ))T −1(ψ−1)Pn(cid:17) ∼ E · Gn,

n → ∞,

with explicit constant E and G. Then by using the ﬁrst identity again we relate the last
determinant back to a Toeplitz+Hankel determinant,

det Pn(T (a0) + H(b0))Pn = det(cid:16)PnT −1(ψ)(I + H(φ))T −1(ψ−1)Pn(cid:17) ,

3

where, as it turns out, a0 and b0 are Fisher-Hartwig symbols which in their product do not
have the smooth part. Of course, the whole procedure is only as useful as far as we are able
to obtain the asymptotics of det Pn(T (a0) + H(b0))Pn. Here we apply the results of Deift,
Its, and Krasovsky mentioned above [12] to identify this asymptotics in four special cases.
The relation between our symbols a and b, and the symbols a0 and b0 to which we apply
[12], is in fact given by

a = c a0,

b = c d b0,

where a0 is even and of Fisher-Hartwig type and b0 relates to a0 as in (i)–(iv). The functions
c and d, while required to be suﬃciently well-behaved, do not have to be even. The function
d is required to satisfy d(eiθ)d(e−iθ) = 1, d(±1) = 1. In this sense, our results generalize
some of the results of [12].

Note that in the most general case (for which we are able to do the separation theorem),

the asymptotics of the corresponding det Pn(T (a0) + H(b0))Pn is not known.

The idea for establishing an identity of the kind (2) and proving a separation theorem
is due to B¨ottcher and Silbermann. In 1985 they proved the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture for
symbols with small parameters (i.e, symbols (1) with |Re αr| < 1/2 and |Re βr| < 1/2), which
was considered a major breakthrough at the time (see [10] and [11, Sect. 10.10]). Although
they considered bounded invertible operators acting between diﬀerent weighted L2-spaces,
the essential point of their analysis can be expressed as identity of the kind

det Tn(a) = det PnT −1(ψ)T (φ)T −1(ψ−1)Pn ,

where a is a Fisher-Hartwig symbol with jumps and zeros/poles, while φ and ψ are Fisher-
Hartwig symbols with jumps only (the corresponding Toeplitz operators being bounded and
invertible under certain conditions).

Here is an outline of the paper. We begin with the operator theoretic preliminaries.
This is done is section 2. In section 3, we reformulate the problem so that we can consider
determinants of bounded operators only. In section 4, some additional operator theoretic
results are given that are particularly useful for our situation. We then prove, in section 5,
a “separation” theorem, that is, a theorem that allows us to compute the asymptotics from
a combination of the smooth symbols and some speciﬁc cases of singular symbols where the
results can be computed by other means. This is done in more generality than is needed for
our ﬁnal results, but it may prove to be useful in the future if other speciﬁc cases of singular
symbols are obtained.

Section 6 is devoted to inﬁnite determinant computations that are required to describe
constants explicitly and the next section contains the known results for the speciﬁc known
singular symbols. Everything is collected in section 8 where the ﬁnal asymptotics are com-
puted.

4

Finally, the last section contains some additional results. In the course of the compu-
tations for the main results of this paper, we discovered that the inverse of certain Identity
plus Hankel operators had inverses that could be described using Toeplitz operators, their
inverses and Hankel operators. So the inverse expressions may be of independent interest
and are also included.

2 Preliminaries

We denote by ℓ2 the space of all complex-valued sequences {xn}∞
n=0 quipped with usual 2-
norm. The set L(ℓ2) is the set of bounded operators on ℓ2 and C1(ℓ2) is the set of trace class
operators on ℓ2.

The Toeplitz operator T (a) and Hankel operator H(a) with symbol a ∈ L∞(T) are the

bounded linear operators deﬁned on ℓ2 with matrix representations

and

T (a) = (aj−k),

0 ≤ j, k < ∞,

H(a) = (aj+k+1),

0 ≤ j, k < ∞.

It is well-known and not diﬃcult to prove that Toeplitz and Hankel operators satisfy the
fundamental identities

(3)

(4)

T (ab) = T (a)T (b) + H(a)H(˜b)

and

H(ab) = T (a)H(b) + H(a)T (˜b).

In the last two identities and throughout the paper we are using the notation

It is worthwhile to point out that these identities imply that

˜b(eiθ) := b(e−iθ).

T (abc) = T (a)T (b)T (c),

H(ab˜c) = T (a)H(b)T (c)

(5)

for a, b, c, ∈ L∞(T) if an = c−n = 0 for all n > 0.

We deﬁne the (ﬁnite section) projection Pn by

Pn : {xk}∞

k=0 ∈ ℓ2 7→ {yk}∞

k=0 ∈ ℓ2,

yk =(cid:26) xk

0

if k < n
if k ≥ n .

Using Pn we can view our determinants of interest as determinants of truncations of inﬁnite
matrices,

det(Tn(a) + Hn(b)) = Pn(T (a) + H(b))Pn.

5

For bounded a and b this is the truncation of a sum of bounded operators, but even more
generally for a, b ∈ L1(T) providing we view the operators as being deﬁned on the space of
sequences with only a ﬁnite number of non-zero terms.

In the next sections we will be mostly concerned with functions a that are products
of continuous functions times those with certain speciﬁc types of singularities.
It will be
convenient for the continuous function factors to satisfy certain properties. To describe this,
we consider the Banach algebra called the Besov class B1
1. This is the algebra of all functions
a deﬁned on the unit circle for which

kakB1

1

:=Z π

−π

1

y2Z π

−π

|a(eix+iy) + a(eix−iy) − 2a(eix)| dx dy < ∞.

A function a is in B1
Moreover, the Riesz projection is bounded on B1

1 if and only if the Hankel operators H(a) and H(˜a) are both trace class.

1, and an equivalent norm is given by

where kAkC1 is the trace norm of the operator A.

|a0| + kH(a)kC1 + kH(˜a)kC1,

Let us also recall the notion of Wiener-Hopf factorization. There are several versions of
it. We say that c ∈ L∞(T) has a bounded (canonical) factorization if we can write c = c−c+
with c+, c−1

+ (T) and c−, c−1

− (T), where

+ ∈ H ∞

− ∈ H ∞

H ∞

± (T) = {f ∈ L∞(T) : fn = 0 for all ± n < 0 }.

+ ∈ H ∞

+ (T) ∩ B1

1 has a canonical factorization in B1

We say that c ∈ B1
1 if we can write c = c−c+ with
c+, c−1
− (T) ∩ B1
It is well known (see, e.g., [11, Sect.
1.
10.24]) that c admits a canonical factorization in B1
1 if and only if the function c does not
vanish on T and has winding number zero. In this case, the logarithm exists, log c ∈ B1
1,
and one can deﬁne normalized factors,

1 and c−, c−1

− ∈ H ∞

c±(t) = exp  ∞Xk=1

t±k[log c]±k! ,

which yield a factorization c = c−G[c]c+ with the constant

G[c] := exp([log c]0)

representing the geometric mean.

For our purposes it is also important to consider a factorization of the kind

d = ˜d−1

+ d+ with d+, d−1

+ ∈ B1

1 ∩ H ∞

+ (T),

6

(6)

(7)

(8)

in which the “minus” factor ˜d−1
+ is given by the “plus” factor d+. It is not too diﬃcult to show
(using the above result and the uniqueness of factorization up to multiplicative constants)
that d ∈ B1
1 possesses a factorization of the above kind if and only if d does not vanish on
T, has winding number zero and satisﬁes the conditions d ˜d = 1 and d(±1) = 1. Notice that
in this case log d ∈ B1

1 is an odd function and thus G[d] = 1.

3 Reformulating the problem

As described in the introduction, we are interested in determinants of Toeplitz plus Hankel
matrices with singular symbols. Let us denote the corresponding (inﬁnite) operator by

M(a, b) := T (a) + H(b).

Notice that when the symbols involve zeros or poles, then either M(a, b) or its inverse are
in general not bounded operators anymore. The purpose of this section is to reformulate
the problem about the asymptotics of det(PnM(a, b)Pn) as one for det(PnAPn) where A is
a bounded (and invertible) operator on ℓ2. More precisely, we are going to prove a formula

det PnM(a, b)Pn = det PnT −1(ψ)M(c, c d φ)T −1(ψ−1)Pn,

(9)

where a and b are certain functions of Fisher-Hartwig type (allowing in particular for zeros
and jumps) while on the right hand side ψ and φ are functions with jump discontiniuties only
and with ranges of parameters such that T (ψ) and T (ψ−1) are invertible Toeplitz operators.
The functions c and d are smooth and nonvanishing functions with winding number zero.

Since the above formula involves inverses of Toeplitz operators, let us ﬁrst recall a

well-known suﬃcient invertibility criterion (see, e.g., [16] or [11]).

Theorem 3.1 Let c be a continuous and nonvanishing function on T with winding number
zero, let τ1, . . . , τR ∈ T be distinct, and

ψ(eiθ) = c(eiθ)

uτr,βr(eiθ) .

RYr=1

If |Re βr| < 1/2 for all 1 ≤ r ≤ R, then T (ψ) is invertible on ℓ2.

Let us now introduce the functions for which identity (9) will be proved. For these
functions the separation theorem will be proved later on as indicated in the introduction.

RYr=1

(10)

(11)

The functions c and d are smooth nonvanishing functions with winding number zero.
In
addition, we will require that d ˜d = 1 and d(±1) = 1. We also assume that τ1, . . . , τR ∈ T+
are distinct, where

and that

T+ := { t ∈ T : Im (t) > 0 } ,

α±, β±, α±

r , βr

are complex parameters satisfying the conditions (16) and (17) stated below, whereas

αr :=

for 1 ≤ r ≤ R.

The functions ψ and φ that will appear in the identity are

uτr,γr u¯τr,γr ,

where

γ± := α± + β± ,

γr := αr + βr .

The restrictions which we are going to impose on the parameters are the following:

which guarantee the invertibility of T (ψ) and T (ψ−1), and

|Re α±| < 1/2,

|Re α±

r | < 1/2,

−3/2 < Re γ+ < 1/2,

−1/2 < Re γ− < 3/2,

|Re γr| < 1/2.

(17)

The last conditions are needed later on.

Theorem 3.2 Let a, b, c, d, φ, ψ be as above with (16) being assumed. Then

det PnM(a, b)Pn = det(cid:16)PnT −1(ψ)M(c, c d φ)T −1(ψ−1)Pn(cid:17).

8

Proof. We ﬁrst notice that a, b ∈ L1(T). Hence the PnM(a, b)Pn is a well-deﬁned matrix,
although M(a, b) may be an unbounded operator. The proof of the identity is based on
In order to avoid
the Wiener-Hopf factorization of the underlying generating functions.
unbounded factors, let us assume for the time being that all the parameters α±, β±, α±
r , βr
are purely imaginary. The general case follows by observing that both sides of the identity
are analytic in each of these parameters.

In order to obtain the factorization introduce the functions

ητ,γ(t) = (1 − t/τ )γ,

ξτ,δ(t) = (1 − τ /t)δ,

where the branches of η (analytic inside the unit circle) and ξ (analytic outside the unit
circle) are chosen so that ητ,γ(0) = ξτ,δ(∞) = 1. Using the above deﬁnitions we can produce
the well-known Wiener-Hopf factorizations for

uτ,β = ξτ,−β ητ,β ,

vτ,α = ξτ,α ητ,α .

Now put

9

which equals

det PnT (ψ−1

− )M(c, c d φ)T (ψ+)Pn

by using (5). Also, notice that the determinants of PnT (ψ±)Pn and PnT (ψ−1
± )Pn are one
since they are either upper or lower triangular matrices with ones on the diagonal. Using
this and the observation that

PnT (ψ−1

+ )Pn = PnT (ψ−1

+ ),

PnT (ψ−)Pn = T (ψ−)Pn,

the above equals

det PnT (ψ−1

+ )T (ψ−1

Applying the following formulas for the inverses,

T −1(ψ) = T (ψ−1

+ )T (ψ−1

− ),

T −1(ψ−1) = T (ψ+)T (ψ+),

concludes the proof of the identity.

✷

It is interesting to consider certain special cases. What we have in mind is the case
where the Fisher-Hartwig part of a (i.e., the product without the function c) is even. This
happens if

If in addition, we put βr = 0, then

α+
r = α−

r = αr .

b = u1,β+ u−1,β− d a .

There are four speciﬁc choices of parameters β± where the factor φ0 := u1,β+ uβ− is actually
continuous:

(1) β+ = β− = 0, φ0(t) = 1 ;

(2) β+ = −1, β− = 1, φ0(t) = −1 ;

(3) β+ = 0, β− = 1, φ0(t) = t ;

(4) β+ = −1, β− = 0, φ0(t) = −1/t .

Notice that the conditions (16) and (17) on the parameters α± and αr amount to the following

To summarize, in these special cases we have

|Re α±| < 1/2,

|Re αr| < 1/2.

a = c v1,α+ v−1,α−

RYr=1

vτr,αr v¯τr,αr ,

b = φ0 d a.

10

(18)

(19)

Notice that the cases (1)-(4) correspond to the cases (i)-(iv) considered in the introduction,
but are slightly more general due to the factor d. The reason why we single out these four
special cases, is because for the computations that are made later in this paper, it is in these
cases that we can actually determine the asymptotics, whereas in the more general case we
can only reduce the asymptotics to a simpliﬁed determinant problem for which an answer is
unknown.

4 Additional operator theoretic results

We need some results about Toeplitz operators and Hankel operators (see [5] and [11] for the
general theory). First of all, in addition to the projections Pn, and Qn = I − Pn we deﬁne

Wn(f0, f1, . . . ) = (fn−1, fn−2, . . . , f1, f0, 0, 0, . . . ),
Vn(f0, f1, . . . ) = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 0, f0, f1, f2, . . . ),

V−n(f0, f1, . . . ) = (fn, fn+1, fn+2, . . . ).

It is easily seen that W 2
also that

n = Pn, Wn = WnPn = PnWn, VnV−n = Qn and V−nVn = I. Note

PnT (a)Vn = WnH(˜a),

V−nT (a)Pn = H(a)Wn.

(20)

Moreover, we have

V−nT (a)Vn = T (a),

V−nH(a) = H(a)Vn, WnT (a)Wn = PnT (˜a)Pn.

(21)

In the proofs that follow we will need the notions of stability and strong convergence

and we describe those now.

Let An be a sequence of operators. This sequence is said to be stable if there exists
an n0 such that the operators An are invertible for each n ≥ n0 and supn≥n0kA−1
n k < ∞.
Moreover, we say that An converges strongly on ℓ2 to an operator A as n → ∞ if Anx → Ax
in the norm of ℓ2 for each x ∈ ℓ2. When dealing with ﬁnite matrices An, we identify the
matrices and their inverses with operators acting on the image of Pn. It is well known (see
[11, Th. 4.15] and worthy to note that stability is related to strong convergence of the inverses
(and their adjoints) in the following sense.

Lemma 4.1 Suppose that An is a stable sequence such that An → A and A∗
Then A is invertible, and A−1

n )∗ → (A−1)∗ strongly.

n → A−1 and (A−1

n → A∗ strongly.

Recall that for trace class operators, the trace “trace A” and the operator determinant
“det(I + A)” are well deﬁned and continuous with respect to A in the trace class norm. The
following well known result shows the connection with strong convergence.

11

Lemma 4.2 Let B be a trace class operator and suppose that An and Cn are sequences such
that An → A and C ∗

n → C ∗ strongly. Then AnBCn → ABC in the trace class norm.

We can use the ﬁrst lemma to obtain information about the strong convergence of the

inverses of Toeplitz matrices.

Proposition 4.3 Let φ ∈ L∞(T). If Tn(φ) is stable, then T (φ) is invertible and

T −1(φ) = s-lim T −1

n (φ),

T −1(eφ) = s-lim WnT −1

n (φ)Wn.

Since P ∗

Proof.
n = Pn → I strongly, it follows that Tn(φ) → T (φ) strongly and the same
holds for the adjoints. Lemma 4.1 implies the ﬁrst statement. For the second one, observe

that WnTn(φ)Wn = Tn(eφ) and proceed similarly. Also note that T (eφ) is the transpose of

T (φ), thus also invertible.

✷

We will need a new deﬁnition and additional results about strong convergence in what
follows (see also [11, Thm. 7.13]). Let A equal the set of all bounded operators A deﬁned
on ℓ2 such that the operator

(cid:18) Wn
V−n (cid:19) A(cid:0) Wn Vn (cid:1) =(cid:18) WnAWn WnAVn
V−nAWn V−nAVn (cid:19)

along with its adjoint (which replaces A with A∗) converge strongly to operators deﬁned on
ℓ2 ⊕ ℓ2. In other words

π(A) := s-lim(cid:18)(cid:18) Wn

V−n (cid:19) A(cid:0) Wn Vn (cid:1)(cid:19)

exists.

Lemma 4.4 The set A is a (closed in the operator topology) C ∗-subalgebra of L(ℓ2), and
the map π : A → L(ℓ2 ⊕ ℓ2) is a *-homomorphism.

Proof.
It is easy to see that the sum, the product and the involution are closed operations
in A and at the same time that π is a *-homomorphism. Using that the norms of Wn and
V±n are one, one can conclude the map π is bounded. The fact that A is closed can be shown
straightforwardly using a Cauchy sequence argument (see also [11, Thm. 7.13]).
✷

We now relate Toeplitz and Hankel operators to A and π.

12

Lemma 4.5 For φ in L∞(T) the operators T (φ) and H(φ) belong to A. Moreover,

H(φ) T (φ) (cid:19) ,
π(T (φ)) =(cid:18) T ( ˜φ) H( ˜φ)

0 0 (cid:19) .
π(H(φ)) =(cid:18) 0 0

Proof. We consider ﬁrst the Toeplitz operator. We use the identities

WnT (φ)Wn = PnT ( ˜φ)Pn,
V−nT (φ)Wn = H(φ)Pn,

WnT (φ)Vn = PnH( ˜φ),
V−nT (φ)Vn = T (φ),

which we stated at the beginning of the section, to show the strong convergence. For the
Hankel operator we consider

WnH(φ)Wn = WnV−nT (φ)Pn,
V−nH(φ)Wn = V−2nT (φ)Pn,

WnH(φ)Vn = WnV−nH(φ),
V−nH(φ)Vn = V−2nH(φ),

and the strong convergence follows because V−n → 0 strongly. For the adjoints the argu-
mentation is analogous.
✷

If we abbreviate

then (3) and (4) imply that

H(φ) T (φ) (cid:19) ,
L(φ) :=(cid:18) T ( ˜φ) H( ˜φ)

L(φ1φ2) = L(φ1)L(φ2) .

(22)

This is not surprising since by an appropriate identiﬁcation of ℓ2 ⊕ ℓ2 with ℓ2(Z) it is easily
seen that L(φ) is the Laurent operator with symbol φ.

The following result is what we will need in the next section. Notice that in the case

of c = 1 we have that π(A) is the identity operator on ℓ2 ⊕ ℓ2.

Proposition 4.6 Let A = T −1(ψ)(T (c) + H(φ))T −1(ψ−1) where c, φ, ψ ∈ L∞(T) are such
that T (ψ±1) are invertible. Then A ∈ A and

π(A) =(cid:18) T (˜c) H(˜c)
H(c) T (c) (cid:19) .

Proof. Since A is a C*-algebra (hence inverse closed) and π is a *-homomorphism, it follows
that T −1(ψ) ∈ A and

π(T −1(ψ)) = (π(T (ψ)))−1 =(cid:18) T ( ˜ψ) H( ˜ψ)

H(ψ) T (ψ) (cid:19)−1

=(cid:18) T ( ˜ψ−1) H( ˜ψ−1)

H(ψ−1) T (ψ−1) (cid:19) = L(ψ−1) .

13

The inversion of the operator matrix follows from (3) and (4). Similarly, we obtain

π(T −1(ψ−1)) =(cid:18) T ( ˜ψ) H( ˜ψ)

H(ψ) T (ψ) (cid:19) = L(ψ)

and π(T (c) + H(φ)) = L(c). Using (22) we obtain π(A) = L(ψ−1)L(c)L(ψ) = L(c), which is
the formula for π(A).
✷

5 Separation theorems

We now establish a separation theorem, which we are formulation in a quite general setting.

Theorem 5.1 Let ψ, φ ∈ L∞(T) with φ ˜φ = 1 be such that T (ψ) is invertible on ℓ2 and such
that the sequence

An = PnT −1(ψ)M(1, φ)T −1(ψ−1)Pn

(23)

is stable. Moreover, assume that c ∈ B1
that d ∈ B1

1 has a Wiener-Hopf factorization d = d+ ˜d−1

1 is nonvanishing and has winding number zero and

+ in B1

1. Then

lim
n→∞

det(cid:16)PnT −1(ψ)M(c, cdφ)T −1(ψ−1)Pn(cid:17)
G[c]n det(cid:16)Pn T −1(ψ)M(1, φ)T −1(ψ−1)Pn(cid:17) = E,
+ )(cid:17) ×

E = det(cid:16)T −1(˜c ˜d+)T (˜c)T ( ˜d+)(cid:17) × det(cid:16)T (cd+)T (c−1d−1

where G[c] = exp([log c]0) and

det(cid:16)T −1(cd+)T −1(ψ)M(c, cdφ)T −1(ψ−1)T (d+)T (ψ−1)M −1(1, φ)T (ψ)(cid:17).

(24)

Proof. We note that the conditions on c and d+ imply the invertibility of T (cd+) and
T (˜c ˜d+) and the stability of Tn(cd+). Because T (ψ) is invertible (and hence ψ−1 ∈ L∞(T))
and one can conclude that T ( ˜ψ−1) is invertible. Indeed, the formula

T −1( ˜ψ−1) = T ( ˜ψ) − H( ˜ψ)T −1(ψ)H(ψ).

can be veriﬁed straightforwardly using (4) and (5). Note that T ( ˜ψ−1) is the transpose of
T (ψ−1), which thus is also invertible. Furthermore the stability of An implies the invertibil-
ity of T −1(ψ)M(1, φ)T −1(ψ−1). Hence M(1, φ) is invertible. From the proof below it will
follow that the operator determinants in (24) are well-deﬁned, by which we mean that the
underlying operator is identity plus a trace class operator.

14

We start by looking at M(c, cdφ) modulo trace class operators. It equals

T (c) + H(cd+ ˜d−1

+ φ) = (T (cd+) + H(cd+φ))T (d−1
+ )

=(cid:16)T (cd+) + T (cd+)H(φ) + H(cd+)T ( ˜φ)(cid:17) T (d−1

= T (cd+)M(1, φ)T (d−1

+ ) + trace class.

+ )

Hence modulo trace class, T −1(ψ)M(c, cdφ)T −1(ψ−1) equals

T −1(ψ)T (cd+)M(1, φ)T (d−1

+ )T −1(ψ−1).

Since the commuators [T −1(ψ), T (cd+)] and [T (d−1

+ ), T −1(ψ−1)] are trace class, it follows that

T −1(ψ)M(c, cdφ)T −1(ψ−1) = T (cd+)T −1(ψ)M(1, φ)T −1(ψ−1)T (d−1

+ ) + K1

with a certain trace class operator K1. Now multiply with Pn from the left and the right
hand side and write

PnT (cd+)AT (d−1

+ )Pn = PnT (cd+)PnAPnT (d−1

+ )Pn + PnT (cd+)QnAQnT (d−1

+ )Pn+

PnT (cd+)QnAPnT (d−1

+ )Pn + PnT (cd+)PnAQnT (d−1

+ )Pn

with A := T −1(ψ)M(1, φ)T −1(ψ−1). We analyse the last three terms. First, using Pn = W 2
n ,
Qn = VnV−n, we see that

PnAQnT (d−1

+ )Pn = Wn(cid:16)WnAVn(cid:17)H(d−1

+ )Wn

tends to zero in trace norm because WnAVn → 0 strongly (see Proposition 4.6). Secondly,

PnT (cd+)QnAPn = WnH(˜c ˜d+)(cid:16)V−nAWn(cid:17)Wn

tends also to zero in trace norm because (V−nAWn)∗ → 0 strongly (again by Prop. 4.6). This
implies that the last two terms of the above expressions tend to zero in trace norm. Finally,

PnT (cd+)QnAQnT (d−1

+ )Pn = WnH(˜c ˜d+)(cid:16)V−nAVn(cid:17)H(d−1

+ )Wn

Here V−nAVn → I strongly (by Prop. 4.6). Hence the latter is WnH(˜c ˜d+)H(d−1
sequence tending to zero in trace norm.

+ )Wn plus a

Summarizing, we have so far

Bn := PnT −1(ψ)M(c, cdφ)T −1(ψ−1)Pn

= Tn(cd+)PnAPnTn(d−1

+ ) + PnK1Pn + WnL1Wn + D(1)
n

15

with K1 and L1 = H(˜c ˜d+)H(d−1
n being a sequence
tending to zero in trace norm. Now we take the inverses of Tn(cd+), PnAPn =: An, and
Tn(d−1

+ ) being trace class operators and D(1)

+ ). Thus,

T −1
n (cd+)BnTn(d−1

+ )A−1

n =

Pn + T −1

n (cd+)PnK1PnTn(d−1

+ )A−1

n + T −1

n (cd+)WnL1WnTn(d−1

+ )A−1

n + D(2)
n

with D(2)
the above sequences and their adjoints it follows that

n → 0 in trace norm due to stability. Using stability and the strong convergence of

T −1
n (cd+)PnK1PnTn(d−1

+ )A−1

n = PnKPn + D(3)
n

and

T −1
n (cd+)WnL1WnTn(d−1

+ )A−1

n = WnLWn + D(4)
n

with D(j)
limits of

n → 0 in trace norm and K, L being trace class. In the latter we use that the strong

WnTn(cd+)Wn, WnAWn = WnAnWn, WnTn(d−1

+ )Wn

(and their adjoints) exist. Indeed, apply Proposition 4.6. Also, due to stability their inverses
have a strong limit.

Thus

T −1
n (cd+)BnT −1

n (d−1

+ )A−1

n = Pn + PnKPn + WnLWn + Dn

(25)

with Dn → 0 in trace norm. Write

Pn + PnKPn + WnLWn = (Pn + PnKPn)(Pn + WnLWn) − PnKWnLWn

with the last term tending to zero in trace norm as Wn → 0 weakly. Now take determinants
and it follows that

lim
n→∞

det Bn

det Tn(cd+) · det An · det Tn(d−1
+ )

= det(I + K) · det(I + L).

From the standard Szeg¨o Limit theorem we get

det Tn(cd+) ∼ G[cd+]n · det T (cd+)T (c−1d−1

+ ),

n → ∞,

while det Tn(d−1

+ ) = G[d−1

+ ]n. Together we get the exponential factor G[c] = G[cd+] · G[d−1
+ ].

It remains to identify trace class operators K and L. This is most conveniently done
by passing to strong limits (and the strong limits after applying Wn from both sides) in (25).
We obtain

T −1(cd+)BT −1(d−1

+ )A−1 = I + K

16

with B = T −1(ψ)M(c, cdφ)T −1(ψ−1) and A = T −1(ψ)M(1, φ)T −1(ψ−1), i.e.,

I + K = T −1(cd+)T −1(ψ)M(c, cdφ)T −1(ψ−1)T (d+)T (ψ−1)M(1, φ)−1T (ψ).

This gives one of the operator determinant in (24). As for the Wn-limits we obtain

T −1(˜c ˜d+)T (˜c)T −1( ˜d−1

+ ) = I + L.

Here notice that WnBnWn → T (˜c) and WnAnWn → I (again by Proposition 4.6). Thus,

det(I + L) = det T −1(˜c ˜d+)T (˜c)T ( ˜d+),

which is the remaining term in (24) along with the constant term from the Szeg¨o-Limit
theorem above.
✷

In order to use the previous theorem we have to know the stability of the sequence An
deﬁned in (23). This is a non-trivial issue and is addressed in [9], where the following two
theorems are proved. These results include certain “local” operators, which we are not going
to deﬁne here, but instead refer to [9].

Theorem 5.2 Let φ and ψ be of the form (13) and (14). Assume that conditions (16) are
satisﬁed. Then the sequence

is stable if and only if the following conditions are satisﬁed

An = Pn T −1(ψ)M(1, φ)T −1(ψ−1)Pn

(i) the operator M(1, φ) is invertible on ℓ2,

(ii) Re γ+ /∈ 2Z + 1/2 and Re γ− /∈ 2Z − 1/2,

(iii) for each 1 ≤ r ≤ R, a certain the “local” operator B(α+

r , α−

r , γr) is invertible.

This theorem is proved in [9] by using general stability results of [15]. These gen-
eral stability results imply that An is stable if and only if a certain collection of oper-
ators is invertible. Among these operators is the strong limit of An, i.e., the operator
A = T −1(ψ)M(1, φ)T −1(ψ−1). Thus it is necessary for stability that M(1, φ) is invertible.
In addition, there occur “local” operators (associated to each point where ψ or φ have jump
discontinuities). Invertibility of the local operators at t = ±1 lead to conditions (ii). For the
jumps at t = τr and t = ¯τr the local operators are Mellin convolution operators B(α+
r , γr)
with 2 × 2 matrix valued symbol deﬁned in terms of the three parameters α+
r , γr ∈ C. As
well known, the invertibility of such operators is equivalent to a Wiener-Hopf factorization
of the matrix symbol, which in general is an unaccessible problem. Therefore, we have only
the following results availabe [9]. On the positive side, part (c) covers the special cases we
are particularly interested in.

r , α−

r , α−

17

Theorem 5.3 Let Re α±

r /∈ Z + 1/2.

(a) If B(α+

r , α−

r , γr) is invertible, then Re γr /∈ Z + 1/2;

(b) If Re γr /∈ Z + 1/2, then B(α+

r , α−

r , γr) is Fredholm with index zero;

(c) If αr = α+

r = α−

r and Re γr /∈ Z + 1/2, then B(αr, αr, γr) is invertible.

Let us return to the invertibility of the operator M(1, φ). For general Toeplitz+Hankel
operators (with jump discontinuities) invertibility is a delicate issue. In [8] necessary and
suﬃcient condtions for invertibility conditions were established for Toeplitz+Hankel operator
T (a) + H(b) with piecewise continuous a, b satisfying the additional condition a˜a = b˜b. Since
φ ˜φ = 1 our operator M(1, φ) = I + H(φ) falls into this class and we cite the corresponding
result (Corollary 5.5 of [8]). For sake of simple presentation we only state it in the form that

provides us a suﬃcient condition. Note that guτ,γ = u¯τ ,−γ , which ensures φ ˜φ = 1.

Theorem 5.4 Let φ be of the form

φ = u1,γ+ u−1,γ−

uτr,γr u¯τr,γr ,

RYr=1

with distinct τ1, . . . , τR ∈ T+ and assume

−3/2 < Re γ+ < 1/2, −1/2 < Re γ− < 3/2, −1/2 < Re γr < 1/2.

Then M(1, φ) = I + H(φ) is invertible on ℓ2.

We will make further remarks on the invertibility of M(1, φ) in Section 9.

As a conclusion of the previous three results we can give some suﬃcient condition for
stability. Notice that if (b) in Theorem 5.3 would imply invertibility (as is the case in (c)),
we would not need the extra condition α+

r = α−
r .

Corollary 5.5 Let φ and ψ be of the form (13) and (14). Assume that conditions (16) and
(17) are satisﬁed and that in addition αr = α+

r . Then An is stable.

r = α−

6 Determinant computations

In view of our separation theorem, we need to do two things. One is to evaluate the constant
(24) and the other is to compute the asymptotics of the determinant of An. The goal of

18

this section is to do the ﬁrst, that is, evaluate the constant (24) which is given in terms of
operator determinants. Some of the factors have been computed before, and the complicated
one can be reduced to simpler ones, which also have been computed before.

We start with the following deﬁnitions and observations. For A, B ∈ L∞(T) for which

H(A)H( ˜B) is trace class and for which T (A) and T (B) are invertible, let

E[A, B] = det(cid:16)T −1(A)T (AB)T −1(B)(cid:17).

Note that H(A)H( ˜B) is trace class if one of the functions is in B1
smooth (and have a continuous logarithm), then it has been shown that

1. If both functions are

E[A, B] = exp(cid:16)trace H(log A)H(log ˜B)(cid:17) = exp(cid:16)Xk≥1

k[log A]k[log B]−k(cid:17).

From this formula it follows that

E[A, B] = E[ ˜B, ˜A] = E[A+, B−],

where A = A−A+ and B = B−B+ are Wiener-Hopf factorization of functions in B1
1.

This constant is related to the constant

E[C] = det T (C)T (C −1) = exp(cid:16)Xk≥1

k[log C]k[log C]−k(cid:17).

appearing in the Szeg¨o-Widom limit theorem. In fact, we have E[C] = E[C, C] = E[C+, C−].

Finally, for a nonvanishing function C ∈ B1

1 with winding number zero let

It was computed in [7] that

F [C] = det(I + T −1(C)H(C))

F [C] = exp(cid:16) −

The previous determinant relates to a slighty more complicated determinant.

Lemma 6.1 Let C ∈ B1
has a bounded Wiener-Hopf factorization φ = φ− ˜φ−1

− . Then

1 be nonvanishing and have winding number zero. Assume that φ

det(I + H(C)T −1(Cφ)) = det(I + H(C)T −1(C)) = F [C].

19

Proof. We have

T (Cφ) = T (φ−)T (C)T ( ˜φ−1
− )
with the factors being bounded invertible operators. Using

H(C)T ( ˜φ−) = H(Cφ−) = T (φ−)H(C)

we obtain

H(C)T −1(Cφ) = H(C)T ( ˜φ−)T −1(C)T (φ−1

− ) = T (φ−)H(C)T −1(C)T (φ−1

− ),

which gives the assertion.

✷

This next lemma illustrates some properties of the constant E[A, B] which will be used

later to simplify determinants.

Lemma 6.2 Let A, B, C ∈ L∞(T) be such that T (A) is invertible and B and C admit
bounded factorizations.

(a) If H(A)H( ˜B) and H(A)H( ˜C) are trace class, then

E[A, BC] = E[A, B] · E[A, C].

(b) If H(B)H( ˜A) and H(C)H( ˜A) are trace class, then

E[BC, A] = E[B, A] · E[C, A].

Proof. Let B = B−B+ and C = C−C+ be the bounded factorizations. Using (3)–(5) in what
follows, we remark that

H(A)H( ˜B−) = H(A)H( ˜B)T (B−1
+ )

and H(A)H( ˜C−) = H(A)H( ˜C)T (C −1
+ )

are trace class. Analogously, H(A)H( ˜B ˜C) = H(A)H( ˜B− ˜C−)T (B+C+). Observe that

H(A)H( ˜B− ˜C−) = H(A)H( ˜B−)T (C−) + H(A)T ( ˜B−)H( ˜C−)
= H(A)H( ˜B−)T (C−) + T (B−)H(A)H( ˜C−)

where we used T (B−)H(A) = H(B−A) = H(AB−) = H(A)T ( ˜B−). Therefore we conclude
that H(A)H( ˜B ˜C) is trace class, too The Toeplitz operators T (B), T (C), and T (BC) are in-
vertible due to the bounded factorizations. This implies that the three operator determinants
are well-deﬁned. A straightforward compuation using the factorizations yields that

E[A, B] = det T −1(A)T (AB)T −1(B) = det T −1(A)T (AB−)T (B−1

− ) = E[A, B−]

20

and similar statements for the other two determinants. In fact, we can write

E[A, B] = det T (B−1

− )T −1(A)T (AB−),

E[A, C] = det T −1(A)T (AC−)T (C −1
− )

and multiplication yields

det T (B−1

− )T −1(A)T (B−)T (A)T −1(A)T (AC−)T (C −1
− )

= det T (B−1

− )T −1(A)T (B−)T (AC−)T (C −1
− )

= det T −1(A)T (AB−C−)T (C −1

− B−1

− ),

which is E[A, BC]. This proof (a). The proof of (b) is analogous.

✷

The next theorem states that the operator determinant occuring in (24) is well deﬁned
under certain conditions (invertibility of M(1, φ)), and that it can be expressed in terms of
above constants in case of a slightly stronger condition (invertibility of T (φ)). Afterwards,
when we specialize to the functions ψ and φ with jump discontinuities we will see that the
stronger condition is redundant for the evaluation of the constant. Notice that we have
already shown in Theorem 5.1 that operator determinant is well-deﬁned, but under the
(perhaps stronger) assumption of the stability of a certain sequence (which in fact implies
invertibility of M(1, φ)).

Theorem 6.3 Let ψ, φ ∈ L∞(T) with φ ˜φ = 1 such that T (ψ) is invertible on ℓ2. Assume
that c ∈ B1
1 has a factorization
d = d+ ˜d−1

1 is nonvanishing and has winding number zero and that d ∈ B1

+ in B1
1.

(a) If M(1, φ) is invertible on ℓ2, then the following operator determinant is well-deﬁned:

E1 = det(cid:16)T −1(cd+)T −1(ψ)M(c, cdφ)T −1(ψ−1)T (d+)T (ψ−1)M −1(1, φ)T (ψ)(cid:17).

(b) If T (φ) is invertible on ℓ2, then M(1, φ) is invertible, and

E1 =

E[ψ, cd+]
E[cd+, ψ]

× E[d−1

+ , ψ−1] × E[cd+, φ] × det(cid:16)(T (cd+φ) + H(cd+))T −1(cd+φ)(cid:17) .

(c) If φ and ψ have a bounded factorization, then

E1 =

E[ψ, c]
E[c, ψ]

× E[cd+, φ] × F [cd+] .

21

Proof.

(a): Abbreviate e = cd+ and write

M(e, eφ) = T (e) + H(eφ) = T (e) + T (e)H(φ) + H(e)T ( ˜φ) = T (e)M(1, φ) + K1

with K1 being trace class. This implies

det M(cd+, cd+φ)M −1(1, φ)T −1(cd+) = det M −1(1, φ)T −1(cd+)M(cd+, cd+φ)

is well-deﬁned. Multiplying this determinant with the well-deﬁned determinant

E[d−1

+ , ψ−1] = det T −1(d−1

= det T (d−1

+ )T (ψ−1d−1

+ )T −1(ψ−1)
+ )T −1(ψ−1)T (d+)T (ψ−1)

and observing M(cd+, cd+φ)T (d−1

+ ) = M(c, cdφ) yields the well-deﬁned determinant

det M −1(1, φ)T −1(cd+)M(c, cdφ)T −1(ψ−1)T (d+)T (ψ−1),

which we can also write as

det M(c, cdφ)T −1(ψ−1)T (d+)T (ψ−1)M −1(1, φ)T −1(cd+).

Next observe that

E[ψ, cd+]
E[cd+, ψ]

= det T (cd+)T (ψ)T −1(ψcd+) · det T (ψcd+)T −1(cd+)T −1(ψ).

= det T (cd+)T (ψ)T −1(cd+)T −1(ψ).

This well-deﬁned determinant we multiply to the above one to obtain

det M(c, cdφ)T −1(ψ−1)T (d+)T (ψ−1)M −1(1, φ)T (ψ)T −1(cd+)T −1(ψ),

which is E1. Summarizing, besides the issue of E1 being well-deﬁned we have shown that

E1 =

E[ψ, cd+]
E[cd+, ψ]

× E[d−1

+ , ψ−1] × det M(cd+, cd+φ)M −1(1, φ)T −1(cd+).

(b) Now we are going to show that M(1, φ) is invertible if so is T (φ) and express the

inverse. Then we will compute the remaining determinant. The identity

(I + H(φ)) (I − H(φ)) = I − H(φ)H( ˜φ−1) = T (φ) T (φ−1)

implies that M(1, φ) = I + H(φ) is invertible. Moreover,

M −1(1, φ) = (I + H(φ))−1 = (I − H(φ)) T −1(φ−1) T −1(φ).

22

Next observe that

M(cd+, cd+φ)(I − H(φ)) = T (cd+) + H(cd+φ) − T (cd+)H(φ) − H(cd+φ)H(φ)

= T (cd+) + H(cd+φ) − H(cd+φ) + H(cd+)T ( ˜φ) − T (cd+φ ˜φ) + T (cd+φ)T ( ˜φ)

= H(cd+)T ( ˜φ) + T (cd+φ)T ( ˜φ)
= (T (cd+φ) + H(cd+)) T (φ−1).

Therefore,

and thus

M(cd+, cd+φ)M −1(1, φ) = M(cd+, cd+φ)(I − H(φ))T −1(φ−1) T −1(φ)

= (T (cd+φ) + H(cd+))T −1(φ),

det(cid:16)M(cd+, cd+φ)M −1(1, φ)T −1(cd+)(cid:17) = det(cid:16)(T (cd+φ) + H(cd+))T −1(φ)T −1(cd+)(cid:17).

We split this into

det(cid:16)(T (cd+φ) + H(cd+))T −1(cd+φ)(cid:17) × det(cid:16)T (cd+φ)T −1(φ)T −1(cd+)(cid:17)

with the last determinant equal to E[cd+, φ]. For part (c), we apply Lemma 6 and Lemma
6.2.
✷

Now we specialize to the functions we are interested in.

Corollary 6.4 Let ψ and φ be given by (13) and (14) and assume that the condition (16)
and (17) hold. Moreover, let c = c−G[c]c+ and d = ˜d−1
1 (see
(6)–(8)). Then the operator determinant E1 of Theorem 6.3 is well-deﬁned and given by

Proof. The assumptions imply that T (ψ) and M(1, φ) are invertible. Hence by the previous
theorem, part (a), the operator determinant E1 is well-deﬁned. It also depends analytically
on the parameters α±, β±, α±
r , βr. Therefore it is suﬃcient to prove the identity under the
assumption that the real parts of all parameters vanish. This implies that T (φ) is invertible
and hence part (c) of the previous theorem can be applied. Moreover, F [cd+] = F [c+d+] as
can be easily seen from (26).

To carry out the computation of the various E[·, ·] terms, we observe that for functions
1 (see (6)) the following general formulas were established

C admitting a factorization in B1
in [11, Sect. 10.62]),

E[uτ,β, C] = C−(τ )−β,

E[C, uτ,β] = C+(τ )β.

Let us now turn to the constant E appearing in Theorem 5.1.

Corollary 6.5 Let ψ and φ be given by (13) and (14) and assume that the condition (16)
and (17) hold. Moreover, let c = c−G[c]c+ and d = ˜d−1
1 (see
(6)–(8)). Then the constant E in (24) is well-deﬁned and given by

where ˆE1 is the expression in the previous corollary.

Proof. We have to identify the additional constants,

which are

det(cid:16)T −1(˜c ˜d+)T (˜c)T ( ˜d+)(cid:17) × det(cid:16)T (cd+)T (c−1d−1

E−1[˜c, ˜d+] · E[cd+] =

E[cd+, cd+]

E[d+, c]

= E[c+, c−].

This we combine with F [cd+] = F [e+] and the previous corollary.

✷

Putting all this together, we have the following.

Corollary 6.6 Let ψ and φ be given by (13) and (14) and assume that the condition (16)
and (17) hold. Moreover, let c = c−G[c]c+ and d = ˜d−1
1 (see
(6)–(8)). Finally, suppose that (iii) of Theorem 5.2 holds. Then

where E is as in the previous corollary.

7 Known asymptotics

In the previous separation theorem and the constant computation we have reduced the
asymptotics of

to the asymptotics of

det(cid:16)PnT −1(ψ)M(c, cdφ)T −1(ψ−1)Pn(cid:17)
det(cid:16)Pn T −1(ψ)M(1, φ)T −1(ψ−1)Pn(cid:17).

25

The separation theorem is of course only as useful as far as we are able to obtain this last
asymptotics. We can reverse the considerations of Section 3 and Theorem 3.2 and obtain

det(cid:16)Pn T −1(ψ)M(1, φ)T −1(ψ−1)Pn(cid:17) = det Mn(a0, b0)

where

(29)

These are the original functions a and b without the c and d terms.

The asymptotics of det Mn(a0, b0) are known in the cases of βr = 0 and αr = α+

r = α−
r
and β+ ∈ {0, −1}, β− ∈ {0, 1}. We remark that in these cases a0 is an even function
which is a product of pure Fisher-Hartwig type functions with zeros/poles only (no jumps).
Furthermore, depending on the values of β±, we have four cases,

b0(t) = ±a0(t),

b0(t) = ta0(t),

b0(t) = −t−1a0(t),

which are precisely the cases (i)–(iv) described in the introduction. We list them here and
note that G(1+z) is the Barnes G-function, an entire function satisfying G(1+z) = Γ(z)G(z)
(see [3]).

The asymptotics of det Mn(a0, b0) are given by

(1) b0(t) = a0(t), βr = 0 and αr = α+

r = α−

r , and β+ = 0, β− = 0.

The above asymptotics have been proved in [12, Theorem 1.25]. In the special case
of α+ = α− = 0 and case (1), see also [6]. On the other hand, if all αr = 0, then the
determinants can be evaluated explicitely because they are related to Hankel determinants
constructed from the moments of classical Jacobi orthogonal polynomials. In this later case
the Hankel determinant asymptotics can also be described as Toeplitz determinants [6].

8 Final computations for the four important cases

Using the previous section and then our computations for the constant E we have the ﬁnal
four answers. We assume in what follows that we have the factorizations c = c−G[c]c+ and
d = d+ ˜d−1
+ (see (6)–(8)) and that condition (18) holds. Then the asymptotics of det Mn(a, b)
are given by the following products.

These formulas follow in a straightforward manner from simply using the known results
quoted in the previous section, along with our separation theorem formulas for the constant
and the evaluation of those for the speciﬁc values of β+ and β−. More speciﬁcally, use (27)
and Corollary 6.5.

9 The inverse of I + H(ψ)

In the course of the computations in the previous sections, we discovered that when ψ−1 = ˜ψ,
explicit forms of the inverse of I +H(φ0ψ) can be found in the four cases φ0 = ±1, φ0(z) = z,
φ0(z) = −z−1 considered in the previously. The inverse will be expressed in terms of the
inverse of T (ψ) and T (ψ−1).

The ﬁrst two cases are rather simple.

Proposition 9.1 Suppose that ψ−1 = ˜ψ and that the operator T (ψ) is invertible. Then
I ± H(ψ) is invertible and

(I ± H(ψ))−1 = T (ψ−1)−1(I ± H(ψ−1))T (ψ)−1 .

Proof. From ψ−1 = ˜ψ and thus T (ψ)T (ψ−1) = I − H(ψ)2, we know that

(T (ψ)T (ψ−1))−1 = T (ψ−1)−1T (ψ)−1 = (I − H(ψ)2)−1.

This means that

T (ψ−1)−1(I ± H(ψ−1))T (ψ)−1 = (I − H(ψ)2)−1T (ψ) (I ± H(ψ−1)) T (ψ)−1.

Now from (4) we know that T (ψ)H(ψ−1) = −H(ψ)T (ψ). So the term

T (ψ) (I ± H(ψ−1) T (ψ)−1 = I ∓ H(ψ)

30

and this yields the result.

✷

In order to continue with the other two case, we need to make a connection with
factorization. If T (ψ) is invertible then there exists a Wiener-Hopf factorziation of ψ such
If in addition ψ−1 = ˜ψ, then using the
that ψ = ψ−ψ+ and ψ± and ψ−1
uniqueness of the Wiener-Hopf factorization (up to multiplicative constants) it is not diﬃcult
to see that the factors are related to each other either by

± are all in L2.

ψ+ = ˜ψ−1
−

or

ψ+ = − ˜ψ−1
− .

This means that we have either

ψ = ˜ψ−1

+ ψ+

or

ψ = − ˜ψ−1

+ ψ+ .

We can equivalently express this dichotomy as

P1T −1(ψ)P1 = 1

or

P1T −1(ψ)P1 = −1

by using that T −1(ψ) = T (ψ−1

+ )T (ψ−1

− ). We need one basic result before we proceed.

Lemma 9.2 If ψ−1 = ˜ψ, if the Toeplitz operator T (ψ) is invertible and if P1T −1(ψ)P1 = 1,
then

(H( ˜ψ) + T (ψ)−1H(ψ) − H( ˜ψ/z)T (ψ)−1H(ψ))H(z) = 0.

and ψ± and ψ−1

If T (ψ) is invertible then there exists a factorization of ψ such that ψ = ψ−ψ+ where
Proof.
−1
ψ− = ˜ψ+
± are all in L2. The operator H(z) is the rank one projection P1,
so the above will be zero if the operator above applied to the constant function f (z) = 1 is
zero. The operator T (ψ)−1H(ψ) is the same as the operator T (ψ−1
+ )H(ψ+) since it agrees
with this operator on all trigonometric polynomials. Hence

T (ψ)−1H(ψ) f = T (ψ−1

+ )H(ψ+) f = (ψ−1

+ (ψ+ − (ψ+)0)/z) = (1 − ψ−1

+ (ψ+)0)/z.

We also have H( ˜ψ) f = P ( ˜ψ/z). Finally

H( ˜ψ/z)((1 − ψ−1

+ (ψ+)0)/z) = P ( ˜ψ/z) − (1 − ψ−1

+ (ψ+)−1

0 )/z.

Putting the three terms together yields the desired result.

✷

Theorem 9.3 Suppose that ψ−1 = ˜ψ, that the operator T (ψ) is invertible, and that P1T −1(ψ)P1 =
1. Then I − H(z−1ψ) is also invertible and its inverse is given by

T (ψ−1)−1(I − H(z−1ψ−1))T (ψ)−1 .

31

Proof. The inveribility of T (ψ) implies the invertibility of T (ψ−1) (see the beginning of
the proof of Theorem 5.1). This also means that the operator T (ψ)T (ψ−1) = I − H(ψ)2 is
invertible.

We do the same steps as in the ﬁrst two cases, except that this time we are dealing

with the term

T (ψ) (I − H(ψ−1/z) T (ψ)−1 = T (ψ) (I − H( ˜ψ/z)) T (ψ)−1

in a slightly diﬀerent manner. First

T (ψ) (I − H( ˜ψ/z)) T (ψ)−1 = I + H(ψ)T (z) + H(ψ)H(z)H( ˜ψ)T (ψ)−1.

Multiplying on the right by I − H(ψ/z) we have that

T (ψ) (I − H( ˜ψ/z)) T (ψ)−1(I − H(ψ/z))

is the same as

I + H(ψ)H(z)H( ˜ψ)T (ψ)−1 − H(ψ)T (z) H(ψ/z) − H(ψ)H(z)H( ˜ψ)T (ψ)−1H(ψ/z).

The above uses the identity H(ψ/z) = H(ψ) T (z) = T (1/z) H(ψ). Now

H(ψ) T (z) H(ψ/z) = H(ψ) T (z) T (1/z)H(ψ) = H(ψ) Q1 H(ψ).

This means the above is the same as

I −H(ψ)H(ψ) + H(ψ)H(z)H(ψ) + H(ψ)H(z)H( ˜ψ)T (ψ)−1 −H(ψ)H(z)H( ˜ψ)T (ψ)−1H(ψ/z).

Thus we will have our result if we can show that the last three terms of this operator sum
to zero. To do this we consider the transpose of

H(ψ) + H( ˜ψ)T (ψ)−1 − H( ˜ψ)T (ψ)−1H(ψ/z),

that is,

H(ψ) + T ( ˜ψ)−1H( ˜ψ) − H(ψ/z)T ( ˜ψ)−1H( ˜ψ).

Using Lemma 9.2, with ψ replaced by eψ the statement is proved.

Theorem 9.4 Suppose that ψ−1 = ˜ψ, that the operator T (ψ) is invertible, and that P1T −1(ψ)P1 =
1. Then I + H(zψ) is also invertible and the inverse is given by

✷

(T (ψ−1) + H(z))−1(I + H(zψ−1))(T (ψ) + H(z))−1.

32

Proof. The inverse of (T (ψ) + H(z))−1 is the same as T (ψ)−1(I − 1
be veriﬁed using basic linear algebra. Now consider the product

2H(z)T (ψ)−1) which can

T (ψ)−1(I −

1
2

H(z)T (ψ)−1) (I + H(zψ)).

Using the factorization of ψ we see this is the same as the operator

Note that T (ψ−1

+ )T (fψ+) = T (ψ)−1 and that

+ )H(zψ+) = T (ψ−1

T (ψ−1

T (ψ−1

+ )[(I −

1
2

H(z))(T (fψ+) + H(zψ+)].
+ )T (fψ+)H(zψ+fψ+

−1

) = T (ψ)−1H(zψ)

and thus is also a bounded operator. Now multiplying by I + H(zeψ) and doing a similar

computation yields

(I + H(zeψ))T (ψ)−1(I −

H(z)T (ψ)−1) (I + H(zψ)) = T (eψ) + H(z).

which gives the desired result.

A concise way to say both of the previous theorems is: The inverse of M(1, φ0ψ) is

given by
