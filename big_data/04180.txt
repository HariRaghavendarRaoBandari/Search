Abstract. We prove that for all k ě 3 and 1 ď ‘ ă k{2, every k-uniform hypergraph H
on n vertices with δk´2pHq ě
contains a Hamiltonian ‘-cycle if
k ´ ‘ divides n. This degree condition is asymptotically best possible.

A k-uniform hypergraph H is a pair pV, Eq with vertex set V and edge set E such that
each edge is a subset of k vertices. Given a k-uniform hypergraph H “ pV, Eq and S P
,
we denote by degpSq the number of edges of H containing S and we denote by NpSq the
pk ´ sq-element sets T P
such that T Y¨ S is an edge of E, i.e. degpSq “ |NpSq|. We
deﬁne the minimum s-degree of H, denoted by δspHq, as the minimum of degpSq over all
s-vertex sets S P

We say that a k-uniform hypergraph C‘ is an ‘-cycle if there exists a cyclic ordering of its
vertices such that every edge of C‘ is composed of k consecutive vertices, two consecutive
edges share exactly ‘ vertices, and every vertex is contained in an edge.

We are interested in the problem of ﬁnding minimum degree conditions that ensure the
existence of Hamiltonian cycles. This problem was ﬁrst studied by Katona and Kierstead
in [6]. They posed a conjecture, which was conﬁrmed by the following result of Rödl,
Ruciński, and Szemerédi [11,12]: For every k ě 3, if H is a k-uniform n-vertex hypergraph
with δk´1pHq ě p1{2 ` op1qqn, then H contains a Hamiltonian pk ´ 1q-cycle. Their proof
introduces the so-called Absorbing Method, which we will use in our proof as well. In [10]
Kühn and Osthus investigated a similar question for 1-cycles, proving that 3-uniform
hypergraphs H with δ2pHq ě p1{4 ` op1qqn contain a Hamiltonian 1-cycle. This result

To see the optimality of the minimum degree condition, we consider the following well-
known example. Let Hk,‘ “ pV, Eq be a k-uniform hypergraph on n vertices such that E is
the set of all edges with at least one vertex from A Ă V , where |A| “
. Note
U
that an ‘-cycle on n vertices contains n{pk ´ ‘q edges and for k ă ‘{2 every vertex is
contained in at most two edges of any ‘-cycle. So the hypergraph Hk,‘ does not contain
a Hamiltonian ‘-cycle and has δk´1pHk,‘q “
2pk´‘q ´ 1
. In [4] Han and Zhao proved a
version of Theorem 1 with this sharp degree condition.

Kühn, Mycroft, and Osthus [9] generalized Theorem 1 to 1 ď ‘ ă k ´ 1, solving
the problem of ﬁnding minimum pk ´ 1q-degree conditions that ensure the existence of
Hamiltonian ‘-cycles in k-uniform hypergraphs. A natural question is to ask for minimum
d-degree conditions forcing the existence of Hamiltonian ‘-cycles for d ă k ´ 1. In this
direction Buß, Hàn, and Schacht proved the following asymptotically optimal result in [2].

Note that the optimality again follows from the hypergraph Hk,‘ considered above
for k “ 3 and ‘ “ 1. The sharp bound for δ1pHq was proved by Han and Zhao in [5].
We generalize Theorem 2 to k-uniform hypergraphs and give an asymptotically optimal
bound on the minimum pk ´ 2q-degree for the existence of Hamiltonian ‘-cycles for all

The hypergraph Hk,‘ motivates the following notion of extremality. Let k ě 3 and ‘ ě 1
be integers and let 0 ă ξ ă 1. A k-uniform hypergraph H “ pV, Eq is called p‘, ξq-extremal
if there exists a set B Ă V such that |B| “
, where epBq
stands for the number of edges in the subhypergraph of H induced by B. Our main result
follows directly from the following theorem.
Theorem 4. For any 0 ă ξ ă 1 and all integers k ě 4 and 1 ď ‘ ă k{2, there exists γ ą 0
such that the following holds for suﬃciently large n. Suppose H is a k-uniform hypergraph

Then H contains a Hamiltonian ‘-cycle.

We remark that for k “ 3 and ‘ “ 1, the corresponding version of Theorem 4 appeared
in the so-called non-extremal case of the sharp version of Theorem 2 in [4]. As a result, it
will be suﬃcient to address the extremal case for a sharp version of Theorem 3 and we
shall return to this in the near future [1]. For details about this approach see [4, 5]. It
is easy to check that if δk´2pHq ě

§2. Main lemmas

2.1. Outline of the proof of Theorem 4. The proof follows the Absorbing Method
introduced by Rödl, Ruciński, and Szemerédi in [11]. For this, we derive the following
lemmas: the Absorbing Lemma (Lemma 7), the Reservoir Lemma (Lemma 6), and the
Path-Tiling Lemma (Lemma 16).

We call an ‘-path A Ď H a β-absorbing path for a k-uniform hypergraph H if for every
subset U Ă V pHq of size at most βn there exists an ‘-path Q such that V pQq “ V pAqY U
and Q has the same ends as A, for some β ą 0. The Absorbing Lemma (Lemma 7)
ensures the existence of a β-absorbing path A. This reduces the problem of ﬁnding a
Hamiltonian ‘-cycle to that of ﬁnding an almost spanning ‘-cycle that contains A.

To obtain an almost spanning ‘-cycle, we ﬁrst ﬁnd a bounded number (independent
of |V pHq|) of ‘-paths covering almost all vertices of V pHq (cid:114) A and then connect them
using only vertices from a small set, a so-called reservoir set that we ﬁx beforehand. The
Reservoir Lemma (Lemma 6) shows that it is possible to ﬁnd this reservoir set R such that
any bounded number of disjoint ‘-paths can be connected to an ‘-cycle, only using vertices
from R.

4

J. DE O. BASTOS, G. O. MOTA, M. SCHACHT, J. SCHNITZER, AND F. SCHULENBURG

We can choose the sizes of A and R small enough, so that the remaining hypergraph
satisﬁes almost the same degree condition as H. Then the Path-Tiling Lemma (Lemma 16)
ensures the existence of a collection of ‘-paths covering almost all vertices of V pHq(cid:114) pA Y Rq.
This is the only point in the proof where we use the exact value of the degree condition and
the non-extremality of H. (In fact, a proof for the corresponding version of the Path-Tiling
Lemma for a direct proof of Theorem 3, which allows us to utilize a slightly larger degree
condition, is a bit simpler.)

As mentioned before, the paths from the Path-Tiling Lemma and A can be connected by
using vertices from R to an almost spanning ‘-cycle containing A. Since this ‘-cycle contains
almost all vertices of H, the absorbing property of A allows us to absorb the leftover
vertices, i.e. vertices that are not contained in any of the ‘-paths and vertices that were
not used to connect the ‘-paths. The resulting ‘-cycle is the desired Hamiltonian ‘-cycle.

2.2. Connecting. In order to construct an almost spanning ‘-cycle of a k-uniform hyper-
graph H, we ﬁrst ﬁnd some ‘-paths and connect them at their ends. Formally, given an
‘-path P “ v1 ¨¨¨ vt in H, we deﬁne the ends of P as the sets tv1, . . . , v‘u and tvt´‘`1, . . . , vtu.
For a collection of 2m mutually disjoint sets of ‘ vertices Xi, Yi we say that a set of ‘-paths
T1, . . . ,Tm connects pXi, YiqiPrms if all paths are vertex-disjoint and Xi and Yi are the ends
of Ti, for all i P rms. The connections for a given collection of disjoint ‘-paths are given
by the following lemma. In addition the lemma allows to restrict the edges used for the
connection to a given “well-connected” subset R of vertices.

Lemma 5 (Connecting Lemma). Let η ą 0 and let k ě 4, 1 ď ‘ ă k{2, and m ě 1 be
Ť
integers. Let H “ pV, Eq be a k-uniform hypergraph and R Ă V with |R| “ r ě 32km{η3.
For every collection of 2m mutually disjoint sets Xi, Yi P

the following holds.

In the main proof we will connect ‘-paths to an almost spanning ‘-cycle. The Reservoir
Lemma (stated below) ensures the existence of a small set R such that we can connect an
arbitrary collection of at most 2m many ‘-sets, only using vertices of R.
Lemma 6 (Reservoir Lemma). Let η, ε ą 0 and let k ě 4, 1 ď ‘ ă k{2, and m ě 1 be
integers. Then for every suﬃciently large k-uniform hypergraph H “ pV, Eq on n vertices
with δk´2pHq ě η

there is a set R Ă V with |R| ď εn such that the following holds.

For every collection Xi, Yi for i P rjs of 2j mutually disjoint sets of ‘ vertices, where
j ď m, there exist ‘-paths T1, . . . ,Tj of length at most 4 connecting pXi, YiqiPrjs that,
moreover, contain vertices from

Lemma 6 is a consequence of Lemma 5, since one can show that a suitably sized random
subset R Ď V inherits with high probability an appropriately scaled minimum degree
condition from H. As a consequence such a set satisﬁes the assumptions of Lemma 5 and
the lemma yields the conclusion of Lemma 6 (see, e.g. [2, Lemma 6] for a very similar
argument).
2.3. Absorption. Given a k-uniform hypergraph H and U Ă V with |U| P pk ´ ‘qN, we
say that an ‘-path A absorbs U if there exists an ‘-path Q with the same ends as A and
V pQq “ V pAq Y U. At the end of the main proof we will absorb all vertices outside of an
almost spanning ‘-cycle to obtain a Hamiltonian ‘-cycle using an absorbing path A, i.e.
a path that can absorb any set U of small linear size. The existence of such a path A is
given by the following lemma.

Lemma 7 (Absorbing Lemma). For every η, ζ ą 0 and all integers k ě 4 and 1 ď ‘ ă k{2

‘-path A with |V pAq| ď ζn such that for all subsets U Ă V (cid:114) V pAq of size at most εn with

‘-path P absorbs S. From (i )–(iv ) it is clear that there are at leastrη5nt choices for P. (cid:3)

Following the scheme from [11], let F Ă V pHqt be a family of ordered t-sets of vertices

such that each of these sets are selected from V pHqt independently with probability

p “ 4εrη5nt´1 .

LOOSE HAMILTONIAN CYCLES FORCED BY pk ´ 2q-DEGREE

An ‘-path in V pHqt is an ordered set pv1, . . . , vtq of vertices such that

e1 “ tv1, . . . , vku,

e2 “ tvk´‘`1, . . . , v2k´‘u,

and e3 “ tv2k´2‘`1, . . . , v3k´2‘u

are edges in H. Using Chernoﬀ’s inequality, with high probability we have

By Claim 8, for each set S of size k ´ ‘, at least rη5nt ‘-paths in V pHqt absorb S. By

Chernoﬀ’s inequality, w.h.p. for all S P
, there are at least 2εn ‘-paths in F that
absorb S. Furthermore, by Markov’s inequality, the number of intersecting pairs of t-sets
in F is at most εn with probability at least 1{2.

Let F be a family that satisﬁes the above conditions. For each of the intersecting pairs
in F, delete one of the t-sets and let F1 Ă F be the remaining family. Using Lemma 5
(with R “ V ) we can connect all ‘-paths in F1 to an ‘-path A with

and this path absorbs all sets U Ă V (cid:114) V pAq with |U| P pk ´ ‘qN and |U| ď εn.
2.4. Path-Tiling. In this part we will ﬁnd a path-tiling of ‘-paths in H that covers all but
a small fraction of the vertices of H. For that purpose we use the so-called weak regularity
lemma for hypergraphs, which is the straightforward extension of Szemerédi’s regularity
lemma for graphs [13]. Roughly speaking, we will show that there exists a fractional
C‘-tiling, a so-called β-hompC‘q-tiling in the resulting reduced hypergraph R of H, where C‘
is the k-uniform “cherry” consisting of two hyperedges that share exactly 2‘ vertices. The
fractional C‘-tiling of R will transfer to a path-tiling of H.

First, we introduce the standard notation for the regularity lemma. Let H “ pV, Eq be

A vertex partition of a hypergraph H satisfying (i )–(iii ) of the conclusion of Lemma 9
will be referred to as an ε-regular partition. For ε ą 0 and d ą 0, we deﬁne the reduced
hypergraph R “ Rpε, dq of H w.r.t. such a partition as the k-uniform hypergraph on the
vertex set rts and

In typical applications of the regularity lemma, the reduced hypergraph inherits some
key features of the given hypergraph H. In fact, the following observation shows that the
reduced hypergraph inherits approximately the minimum degree condition of the original
hypergraph. A similar result can be found in [3, Proposition 16] and for completeness we
include its proof below.

We will ﬁnd a suitable fractional C‘-tiling in the reduced hypergraph R, where the
cherry C‘ is the k-uniform hypergraph with vertex set r2k ´ 2‘s and edges t1, . . . , ku and
tk ´ 2‘ ` 1, . . . , 2k ´ 2‘u.
Deﬁnition 11. Let C and R be k-uniform hypergraphs, β ą 0, and let Φ be a multiset of
hypergraph homomorphisms from C to R. A function h: Φ Ñ taβ : a P Ną0u is called a

The following building block allows us to easily deﬁne a tiling on a single edge.

non-zero only on e, such that whpviq “ 1 for i P rk ´ 2s and whpvk´1q “ whpvkq “ k´2

Proof. For this consider the homomorphism that maps C‘ to e such that v1, . . . , v2‘´2, vk´1
and vk are the image of the intersection of the two edges of C‘. By cyclically shifting the
image of the ﬁrst 2‘ ´ 2 vertices of the intersection and appropriate scaling, we obtain all
homomorphisms for the required tiling. We obtain the even weight distribution for the last
(cid:3)
part of the fact by cyclically shifting the whole image k times.

The following lemma is the main part of the proof of the Path-Tiling Lemma. For this
we introduce a fractional notion of extremality. We say that a k-uniform hypergraph R
on t vertices is β-fractionally p‘, ξq-extremal if there is a function b: V pRq Ñ t0u Y rβ, 1s

Note that the function b can be viewed as a set of weighted vertices, which plays the rôle
of the vertex set B in the deﬁnition of extremality.
Lemma 13. For all integers k ě 3 and 1 ď ‘ ă k{2, there exist C and γ0 such that for
all α ą 0 and γ P p0, γ0q, there exist β ą 0 and ε ą 0 such that the following holds for

and let t be suﬃciently large such that c, β " 1{t. Note that any βi-hompC‘q-tiling is also
a β-hompC‘q-tiling as βi is a multiple of β. To prove the lemma, we show that given a
βi-hompC‘q-tiling h with weight wphq ă p1 ´ αqt, there exists a βi`1-hompC‘q-tiling h1 with
weight wph1q ě wphq ` ct. We can begin with the trivial 1-hompC‘q-tiling with weight zero

and hence, after at most 1
For the rest of the proof ﬁx a βi-hompC‘q-tiling h with weight wphq ă p1 ´ αqt and
assume for a contradiction that there is no βi`1-hompC‘q-tiling with weight wphq ` ct. It

LOOSE HAMILTONIAN CYCLES FORCED BY pk ´ 2q-DEGREE

13
follows from the upper bound on the weight that there are at least αt{2 vertices v P V pRq
with whpvq ă 1 ´ α{2 and we may ﬁx a subset W of them of size αt{2. Although a tiling
with bigger weight implies the existence of more edges, we will not use these edges for an
improvement. So we may actually assume w.l.o.g. that

p1 ´ 2αqt ď wphq ă p1 ´ αqt,

as we can otherwise add edges on V (cid:114) W until this weight can be trivially achieved and
remove these edges after the improvement step.

We view Φ, the set of homomorphisms from C‘ to R, as a multiset, where we include ϕ
, so that we can assume h: Φ Ñ tβiu. With this notion the following

Also, we identify a homomorphism ϕ in Φ with the – not necessarily distinct – vertices
pv1, . . . , v2k´2‘q in its image, where tv1, . . . , vku and tvk´2‘`1, . . . , v2k´2‘u form edges in R.
We refer to the elements of Φ as cherries C P Φ.

Consider the pk ´ 2q-sets in W that satisfy the degree condition (6) of the lemma. Since
ε ! α, among those pk´ 2q-sets we ﬁnd a collection W whose elements are pairwise disjoint
and cover at least |W|{2 vertices. For later reference we note

For K P W we consider the link graph LK of K in R, which is the (2-uniform) graph
containing all edges e such that K Y e P EpRq. We will ﬁnd pairs C,C1 P Φ on which the

bipartite induced link graph LKpC,C1q, i.e. edges that have one vertex in C and one in C1.

We show in the following that for most K P W the bipartite link graph between most C
and C1 has a very speciﬁc structure. We call C,C1 P Φ an extremal pair for K if there exist
special vertices u P C and u1 P C1 such that LKpC,C1q contains exactly all edges incident to
these two vertices.

Claim 14. There exists an element uC P C for all C P Φ such that the following holds. For
all but γ|W| sets K P W all but a C1γ fraction of the pairs C,C1 P Φ are extremal for K
with special vertices uC and uC1.

Proof. The proof of the claim consists of three parts. First we show that if for a given
pk ´ 2q-tuple K P W and some pairs of cherries C,C1 P Φ the induced bipartite link
graph LKpC,C1q contains more than 4pk ´ ‘q ´ 1 edges, then there is a local improvement
of the tiling by a weight of at least βi{4. In a second step we shall bound the number of
possible local improvements, as otherwise we could combine them to arrive at a desired
tiling h1 with a weight increased by ct and this would already conclude the proof of
Lemma 13. In the last step we utilise this bound on the number of local improvements to
show that “typically” LKpC,C1q contains only 4pk ´ ‘q´ 1 edges and displays the structural
conditions stated in the claim.

For the ﬁrst step we consider two cases. Suppose that there is a matching with three
edges in LKpC,C1q for some K P W and C, C1 P Φ. Recall that LKpC,C1q is a bipartite
graph with partition classes of size 2pk ´ ‘q. Then we assign the weight
6pk´‘´1q βi to
the vertices of the matching edges and the weight βi to the vertices of K. Setting in
addition h1pCq “ h1pC1q “ p1´ k´2
6pk´‘´1qqβi, this deﬁnes a valid βi`1-hom-tiling h1 by applying
Fact 12 (with q “ 1
3βi) to the three edges in R corresponding to the matching edges in the
link graph. Indeed, by considering the vertices on which the weight has changed, it is easy
to see that

which yields the local improvement in this case.

In the other case, suppose that there is no matching of size three in LKpC,C1q. Then by
König’s theorem [8] there is a vertex cover of size at most two. Consequently, there are at
most 4pk ´ ‘q edges in LKpC,C1q. Note that if LKpC,C1q contains indeed 4pk ´ ‘q edges,
then the two cover vertices are in the same class – say in C – and their neighbourhood is
all of C1. In particular there are two edges for each of the two vertices using four distinct
vertices in C1. On the vertices of these edges we put weights
8pk´‘´1q βi and βi on the
8pk´‘´1qqβi. Again, this deﬁnes
vertices of K. Set h1pCq “ p1´ k´2
4pk´‘´1qqβi and h1pC1q “ p1´ k´2

This establishes the local improvement for this case and concludes the ﬁrst step.

LOOSE HAMILTONIAN CYCLES FORCED BY pk ´ 2q-DEGREE

15
For the second step suppose that there are at least γ|W|{2 many K P W such that for
each such K we can deﬁne a local improvement for γ|Φ|2 cherry pairs. We apply these
local improvements greedily, only using each cherry C P Φ at most once (over all K), to
increase the weight of the tiling as much as possible. This procedure may end, either when
every K P W contains a saturated vertex and in this case we enlarge the total weight by
2 ¨ γ|W|{2, or when for every K P W for each of the γ|Φ|2 pairs of cherries at least
at least α
one cherry was used for some local improvement. Since any collection of γ|Φ|2 pairs of
cherries contains γ|Φ|{4 such pairs none of which share a cherry, then the latter case would
imply that we applied γ|Φ|{8 local improvements before.
In summary we showed that if for at least γ|W|{2 ě γ αt

8k (see (9)) many K P W we can
deﬁne a local improvement for γ|Φ|2 cherry pairs then we can aggregate local improvements
leading to a βi`1-hompC‘q-tiling h2 with weight at least

which would conclude the proof of Lemma 13.

Consequently, for the third step we may only consider those K P W for which at
most a γ-fraction of its cherry pairs C, C1 induce at least 4pk ´ ‘q edges or a 3-matching
in LKpC,C1q. The degree condition (10) of K P W translates to an average number of
edges of at least 4pk ´ ‘q ´ 1 ´ 12γpk ´ ‘q2 in the link graphs. So, as C1 was chosen big
enough, at most pC1 ´ 1qγ of the cherry pairs do not have exactly 4pk ´ ‘q ´ 1 edges.

There can only be exactly 4pk ´ ‘q ´ 1 edges and no 3-matching if there is a vertex on
each side that has a complete neighbourhood, so these pairs are indeed extremal. Hence
it remains to show that typically the special vertex u P C in an extremal pair LKpC,C1q
is independent of K and C1. So assume for a moment that there are K, K1 P W and two
vertices u and v in some C P Φ such that u is a special vertex for an extremal pair LKpC,C1q
and v is special for some extremal pair LK1pC,C2q. In this case we can deﬁne a local
improvement by “splitting” the case with four edges above. Indeed choose four edges
incident with u in LKpC,C1q and four for v in LK1pC,C2q. Assign weights 1
2βi to the vertices
4pk´‘´1qqβi and
of K and K1, and
8pk´‘´1q βi in case C1 “ C2). Similarly
reduce the weights on C1 and C2 by
k´2
as in the ﬁrst step, this gives a local improvement of βi{4.
If for at least γ|W|{2 many K P W we can deﬁne such a local improvement for γ|Φ|2
extremal pairs, we could aggregate them like in the second step, which would conclude the
proof of Lemma 13. So for each cherry C we may ﬁx a vertex uC having the properties of

the claim.

We call C P Φ good if it is contained in at least 1

are bad. Moreover, for every vertex v P V we denote by Φbadpvq the number of bad cherries
C P Φ that contain it.

2|Φ| extremal pairs for at least 1

To complete the proof of the lemma we will show that we ﬁnd a matching M such that
every vertex v P e P M is contained in “many” good cherries. For each good cherry C P Φ
there are a lot of choices for C1 and K P W such that C and C1 are an extremal pair
for K. We will redistribute the weights to transfer weight from the non-special vertices of C
(and C1) to K, which will reduce the weight on v (since we will ensure that v is a non-special
vertex). Repeating this for every v P e will allow us to obtain a local improvement for the
tiling and repeating this for suﬃciently many hyperedges e P M leads to the desired global
improvement.

In particular, we may assume that minvPetb1pvqu ą 0 for every e P M, since this has no
eﬀect on inequality (12). Moreover, from the deﬁnition of the function b1p¨q it then follows
that minvPetb1pvqu ě βi for every e P M.

For each vertex v P

M, we consider good cherries that contain v as a non-special
vertex. Assume that we have K P W and an extremal pair C, C1 such that v is a non-special
vertex in C. The link graph LKpC,C1q contains all edges incident to the two special vertices.
We deﬁne a local weight shift as follows. Assign weights
4pk´‘´1q βi to the vertices
of all edges incident with exactly one of the special vertices, βi to the vertices of K and
set h1pCq “ h1pC1q “ p1 ´ k´2
4pk´‘´1qqβi. By similar calculations as before, this deﬁnes a valid
βi`1-hom-tiling h1 with wph1q “ wphq. On the other hand, the weight of the vertex v and
all other non-special vertices in LKpC, C1q is reduced by

It follows from the deﬁnition of b1pvq that we have at least b1pvq{βi many good cherries that
contain v as non-special vertex and we shall apply at most minuPetb1puqu{βi local weight
shifts for a vertex v P e P M.

For every edge e P M we would like to apply these local weight shifts for every vertex
v P e, where we cycle through all k vertices and apply one shift at a time. In other words,
we evenly reduce the weights on the vertices of e. Note that we can apply these local
weight shifts using K,C, and C1 unless we have saturated the vertices in K or used one of
the cherries before. The procedure stops as soon as we reach a vertex for which no local
weight shift is possible.

We ﬁrst discuss the ideal case that this procedure does not stop, i.e. for every e P M and
every v P e we applied minuPetb1puqu{βi local weight shifts. In this case, for every e P M
we reduced the weight of all vertices v P e by at least

which concludes the proof of Lemma 13.

(cid:3)
Next we want to transfer the β-hompC‘q-tiling of R into a path-tiling of H. For that

purpose we will use the next lemma from [4].
Lemma 15. Fix k ě 3, 1 ď ‘ ă k{2 and ε, d ą 0 such that d ą 2ε. Let m ą k2
Suppose V “ pV1, . . . , Vkq is an pε, dq-regular k-tuple with

ε2pd´εq.

|V1| “ ¨¨¨ “ |V2‘| “ m and |V2‘`1| “ ¨¨¨ “ |Vk| “ 2m.

Then there are at most
2kεm vertices of V.

pd´εqε vertex disjoint ‘-paths that together cover all but at most
2k
(cid:3)
Finally, by using Lemma 15 on the edges of the β-hompC‘q-tiling of R given by Lemma 13,

we obtain a path-tiling from H of the desired size.
Lemma 16 (Path-Tiling Lemma). For all integers k ě 3 and 1 ď ‘ ă k{2, there exist
C, γ0 ą 0 such that for all α ą 0, γ ď γ0 there exists an integer s such that the following
holds for all suﬃciently large n. Let H be a k-uniform hypergraph on n vertices and

Then there is a family of at most s disjoint ‘-paths that cover all but at most αn vertices
of H or H is p‘, Cγq-extremal.

of the proof in two cases, depending on whether R is β-fractionally p‘, 4C1γq-extremal.
Suppose that R is not β-fractionally p‘, 4C1γq-extremal. Then Lemma 13 implies
that there exists a β-hom(C‘)-tiling h of R with weight p1 ´ α

homomorphisms ϕ from C‘ to R with hpϕq ą 0, which implies in fact hpϕq ě β. We will

§3. Proof of Theorem 4

Below we give the proof of the main technical result, which details the outline from

Section 2.1 and is based on the lemmas from the last section.
Proof of Theorem 4. Let 0 ă ξ ă 1 and let k ě 4 and 1 ď ‘ ă k{2 be integers. Let C
and γ0 be given by the Path-Tiling Lemma (Lemma 16) for k and ‘. Let γ ă γ0 be a
suﬃciently small constant. By the Absorbing Lemma (Lemma 7) for γ, ζ “ γ, k and ‘ we
obtain ε. Following the quantiﬁcation of the Path-Tiling Lemma for α “ ε{2 and 3γ we
obtain an integer s. We will use the Reservoir Lemma (Lemma 6) with η “ 4pk´‘q´1
4pk´‘q2 ´ 2γ,
ε1 “ mintε{2, γu, k, and s ` 1. Let n P pk ´ ‘qN be suﬃciently large and let H be a
k-uniform hypergraph on n vertices.

Suppose H is not p‘, ξq-extremal and

Let A be the absorbing path obtained with the Absorbing Lemma and let X0 and Y0 be
the ends of A. Then |V pAq| ď γn and A has the following absorption property: for every
subset U Ă V (cid:114) V pAq with |U| ď εn and |U| P pk ´ ‘qN there exists an ‘-path Q Ă H
such that V pQq “ V pAq Y U and Q has the ends X0 and Y0.

Let V 1 “ pV (cid:114) V pAqqYtX0, Y0u and let H1 “ HrV 1s be the subhypergraph of H induced

by V 1. Note that

The Reservoir Lemma guarantees the existence of a set R Ă V 1 with |R| ď ε1n ď γn such
that for every j ď s ` 1 and every family pXi, YiqiPrjs of mutually disjoint pairs of sets of ‘
vertices can be connected by paths that contain vertices of

by V 2. Then

Now we apply the Path-Tiling Lemma to H2 and obtain a family of at most s disjoint
‘-paths that cover all but at most α|V 2| ď αn vertices of H2, or H2 is p‘, Cγq-extremal.
Set n2 “ |V 2| and suppose for a contradiction that H2 is p‘, Cγq-extremal. Then there
exists a set B Ă V 2 such that |B| “

most n ´ n2 ď 2γn vertices from V (cid:114) B to B, we obtain a vertex set B1 Ă V such that

a contradiction to the fact that H is not p‘, ξq-extremal. Therefore, we may assume that
there exist disjoint ‘-paths P1, . . . ,Pj with j ď s that cover all but at most α|V 2| ď αn
vertices of H2.

For all i P rjs, we denote the ends of Pi by Xi and Yi. Let Yj`1 “ Y0. By using the
Reservoir Lemma to connect the family pXi, Yi`1q0ďiďj, we connect the ‘-paths A,P1, . . . ,Pj
to an ‘-cycle C Ă H.

Let U “ V (cid:114) V pCq be the set of vertices not contained in C, i.e. the vertices that were
leftover in the reservoir R or uncovered by the path-tiling. We have |U| ď pε1 ` αqn ď εn.
Furthermore, since C is an ‘-cycle and n P pk ´ ‘qN, we have |U| P pk ´ ‘qN. Therefore,
we can utilise the absorbing property of A to replace A in C by a path Q with the same
ends as A, obtaining a Hamiltonian ‘-cycle of H.
