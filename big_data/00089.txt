The transfer of data is a fundamental task in information systems. Microprocessors contain ded-
icated data buses that transmit bits across diﬀerent locations and implement sophisticated routing
protocols. Transferring quantum information with high ﬁdelity is a challenging task, due to the
intrinsic fragility of quantum states. We report on the implementation of the perfect state transfer
protocol applied to a photonic qubit entangled with another qubit at a diﬀerent location. On a
single device we perform three routing procedures on entangled states with an average ﬁdelity of
97.1%. Our protocol extends the regular perfect state transfer by maintaining quantum information
encoded in the polarisation state of the photonic qubit. Our results demonstrate the key principle
of perfect state transfer, opening a route toward data transfer for quantum computing systems.

Transferring quantum information between distant lat-
tice sites without disrupting the encoded information
en route is crucial for future quantum technologies [1–
4]. Cascaded SWAP operations between neighbouring
sites enable quantum information transfer, however, this
method is intrinsically weak as individual errors accu-
mulate after each operation, leading to a heavy decrease
in transfer success. A more robust scheme designed to
minimize dynamic control is therefore required.

The perfect state transfer (PST) protocol utilises an
engineered but ﬁxed coupled lattice. Quantum states are
transferred between sites through Hamiltonian evolution
for a speciﬁed time [2, 3]. For a one-dimensional system
with N sites, the state at site n is transferred to site N −
n + 1 with 100% probability [5]. PST can be performed
on any quantum computing architecture where coupling
between sites can be engineered, such as ion traps [6] and
quantum dots [7]. Figure 1 presents an illustration of the
PST protocol. The encoded quantum state, initially at
the ﬁrst site, is recovered at the ﬁnal site after a speciﬁc
time. Aside from qubit relocation, the PST framework
can be applied to entangled W-state preparation [8], state
ampliﬁcation [9] and even quantum computation [10].

To date, most research on PST has been theoretical
[2, 3, 5, 8–15] with experiments [16, 17] being limited to
demonstrations where no quantum information is trans-
ferred and do not incorporate entanglement, often con-
sidered the deﬁning feature of quantum mechanics [18].
We present the implementation of a protocol that extends
PST for relocating a polarisation encoded photonic qubit
across a one-dimensional lattice, realised as an array of 11
evanescently coupled waveguides [19–21]. We show that
the entanglement between a photon propagating through
the PST waveguide array and another photon at a dif-
ferent location is preserved.

In order to characterise the coupling coeﬃcient spec-
tra, we inject horizontally and vertically polarized laser
light at 808 nm into each input waveguide. Laser light
is more robust to noise than single photons and we can
monitor the output with a CCD camera to fast gather
results. Using laser light at the same wavelength as our
single photons will give an output intensity distribution
equivalent to the output probability distribution for
detecting single photons [19]. Ideally light injected into
waveguide n will output the device only in waveguide
N − n + 1, however, this assumes an approximate model
of nearest-neighbour coupling only. Taking into account
coupling between further separated waveguides reduces
the transfer probability. This decrease is greater for light
injected closer to the centre of the array. Figures 3d-f
present our measured output probability distribution
for horizontally (P H
n ) polarised
laser light injected into each input waveguide, where
n is the output waveguide number. Fidelity between
the probability distributions for each polarisation is
. This ﬁdelity
is closely related to how similar the two coupling coef-
ﬁcient spectra are. We measure an average probability
distribution ﬁdelity for all transfers of 0.949 ± 0.007
(see Supplementary Section I for all ﬁdelity values). We
encode quantum information in the polarisation state of
the photon and are interested in reliably relocating this
qubit. We use a single optical ﬁbre to capture photons
from the designed output waveguide which, in all cases,
is the waveguide with the greatest output probability.

ability amplitude of the horizontal (vertical) component
of the photon. From quantum process tomography on
the output polarisation states, we can generate a process
matrix χpol for each transfer [1, 24]. We aim to perform
identity so the quantum information encoded in the po-
larisation can be recovered after relocation. We measure
a polarisation phase shift associated with each transfer.
This phase shift can be compensated for with a local po-
larisation rotation applied before injection. Figures 3g-i
present our measured process matrix for each transfer.
Across all transfers we demonstrate an average ﬁdelity of
the polarisation process including compensation to iden-
tity of 0.982±0.003 (see Supplementary Section II for de-
tails of the compensation scheme and all ﬁdelities). Pro-
cess ﬁdelity is calculated as Fprocess = T r{χ1χpol+comp}
[25] where χ1 is the process matrix for the identity oper-
ation and χpol+comp is the combined polarisation opera-
tion and compensation process matrix.

FIG. 2. Propagation simulations with diﬀerent cou-
pling coeﬃcient spectra. a, A photon is injected into the
ﬁrst waveguide of an 11 waveguide array with the Hamiltonian
in equation (1) and a uniform coupling coeﬃcient spectrum.
With the constraint that reﬂections oﬀ boundaries are not al-
lowed, we calculate a maximum probability of transferring the
photon to waveguide 11 of 78.1% [2]. b, A photon is injected
into the ﬁrst waveguide of an 11 waveguide array, this time
with the coupling coeﬃcient spectrum of equation (2). After
evolution for a pre-determined time, the photon is received at
waveguide 11 with 100% probability [3].

The spectrum of coupling coeﬃcients Cn,n+1 is crucial for
successful PST. Evolution of this Hamiltonian with a uni-
form coupling coeﬃcient spectrum, equivalent to equally
spaced waveguides, is not suﬃcient for PST with over
three lattice sites as simulated in ﬁgure 2a. PST requires
the coupling coeﬃcient spectrum to follow the function

(cid:112)n(N − n),

Cn,n+1 = C0

(2)

where C0 is a constant, N is the total number of lattice
sites and evolution is for a speciﬁc time tPST = π
2C0
[3]. This enables arbitrary length PST as simulated
in ﬁgure 2b for 11 sites.
The coupling coeﬃcient
spectrum for each polarisation must be equal and follow
equation (2) for the qubit to be faithfully relocated and
the polarisation encoded quantum information to be
preserved. The distance between waveguides dictates
the coupling coeﬃcient, however, for planar systems, the
coupling coeﬃcient of each polarisation will in general
be unequal due to the waveguide birefringence. In order
to achieve equal coupling between polarisations, the
waveguide array is fabricated along a tilted plane in
the substrate [23]. This is made possible by the unique
three-dimensional capabilities of the femtosecond laser
writing technique (see Supplementary Section I for fur-
ther fabrication and device details). We inject photons
into waveguides 1, 6 and 10 of the array which after time
tPST transfer to waveguides 11, 6 and 2, respectively.

injected states are recovered with an average ﬁdelity of
0.971± 0.019 and average similarity of 0.978± 0.019 (see
Supplementary Section IV for all values).

We have proposed and experimentally demonstrated
a protocol for relocating a photonic qubit across 11 dis-
crete sites maintaining the quantum state with high ﬁ-
delity and preserving entanglement with another qubit at
a diﬀerent location. We can aim to improve our ﬁdelity
by reducing next-nearest-neighbour coupling via further
separating the waveguides and having a longer device.
This would increase the contrast between nearest- and
next-nearest-neighbour coupling to better ﬁt the Hamil-
tonian in equation (1). A bi-product of longer devices,
however,
is an increase in propagation loss. Depth-
dependent spherical aberrations in the laser irradiation
process may also aﬀect the homogeneity of the three-
dimensional waveguide array. Additional optics in the
laser writing setup could be employed to reduce this ef-
fect. Protocols for relocating quantum information across
discrete sites are essential for future quantum technolo-
gies. Our protocol builds on the perfect state transfer
with extension to include an additional degree of freedom
for encoding quantum information. This demonstration
opens pathways toward faithful quantum state relocation
in quantum computing systems.

T ∈ {11, 6, 2}. With high ﬁdelity the probability

state remains almost pure. This result demonstrates
that with our device we can relocate a polarisation
qubit between distant sites and preserve entanglement
with another qubit at a diﬀerent location. In principle
our device could route qubits from any waveguide n
to waveguide N − n + 1. Quantum error correction
protocols require sophisticated interconnection in order
to access individual qubits for control and measurement
within large, highly entangled surface code geometries
[29]. PST is a clear gateway towards accessing qubits
in such systems without disrupting quantum states and
entanglement throughout the surface code.

Decoherence has applications in quantum simulation to
emulate systems in nature [30] and it is therefore impor-
tant to note that this approach for relocating quantum
information can be applied to states of any purity [3].
We prepare decohered states by introducing a time delay
between the horizontal and vertical components of the
polarisation qubit. The purity of the state can be cal-
culated as the convolution of the horizontal and vertical
components with a time delay τ

I. TECHNICAL FABRICATION DETAILS

Waveguide fabrication Integrated photonic waveg-
uides with single mode propagation at 808 nm are fabri-
cated by focusing femtosecond laser pulses with an energy
of 300 nJ/pulse, at the repetition rate of 1 MHz, in the
bulk of a borosilicate substrate (Eagle2000, Corning) by
means of a 20× microscope objective (NA = 0.45, Achro-
plan) and translating the sample at the constant speed
of 40 mm/s.
The resulting waveguides exhibit relatively low propaga-
tion losses (0.8 dB/cm) and elliptical guided mode (1/e2
diameters measured as 9.4 µm × 15.1 µm).

Design of the array The inter-waveguide distances
are not uniform and are specially tailored in order to
implement the correct couplings expressed by equation 2
in the main text, which allow the perfect state transfer
protocol. The coupling between waveguides is a function
of their separation d, according to the formula

C(d) = ae−bd,

(S1)

where a and b are constants whose values have been mea-
sured as a = 3.6 mm−1 and b = 0.19 µm−1. The distance
dn between waveguide n and waveguide n+1 of the array
can be parametrised as follows:

(cid:35)

dn = dmin +

N 2 − 1
n (N − n)

(S2)

where dmin is a free fabrication parameter that represents
the minimum distance in the array and N (odd for this
equation) is the total number of waveguides. With this
parametrisation, the state transfer distance zP ST can be
expressed as:

π

zP ST =

√

N 2 − 1
4Cmax

,

(S3)

where Cmax = C(dmin). The choice of the values
N and dmin must be done in order to minimise the
array non-idealities such as propagation losses, array
inhomogeneity and parasitic couplings between non
adjacent sites. In our design we have chosen the values
N = 11 and dmin = 12 µm. Consequently, we fabricated
16 arrays with diﬀerent lengths, spanning around the
theoretical refocusing distance zth
P ST = 23 mm, ranging
from 21.5 to 29 mm, and the best results were observed
for an array length of 22.5 mm.
In order to ensure
that the inter-waveguide couplings for horizontally and
vertically polarised light are the same, the arrays extend
diagonally into the substrate, at an angle of ≈ 60◦.
The central waveguide of each array, corresponding to
waveguide 6, is situated 170 µm below the sample top
surface. Finally, in order to couple light selectively in a
given waveguide of the array, only waveguides identiﬁed

Classical Characterisation In order to characterise
the performances of the fabricated structures, we injected

and σ the polarisation). We used laser light at 808 nm,

II. QUANTUM PROCESS TOMOGRAPHY

Quantum process tomography (QPT) characterises an
unknown quantum process by performing state tomogra-
phy on a range of output states. We perform single qubit
QPT using input states |H(cid:105), |V (cid:105), |D(cid:105) = 1√
(|H(cid:105) + |V (cid:105))
(|H(cid:105) + i|V (cid:105)). Each state is prepared
and |R(cid:105) = 1√
through a straight waveguide, before switching to the
PST array.

The output χ matrices are shown in ﬁgures 3g-i of the

mine a compensation scheme in terms of an HWP rota-
tion and polarisation phase rotation. This is the same
scheme as the state preparation and so the state prepa-
ration and compensation can be combined. The wave-

Process ﬁdelity values describe how close the overall
process (compensation and measured PST) is to iden-
tity on the polarisation. This is calculated as the trace
distance between identity and the polarisation process
T r{χ1χpol+comp}. The compensation scheme gives a
very good ﬁdelity on how close to identity the whole op-
eration will be. The reason it is not 100% is a result of
some decoherence in the system, which cannot be com-
pensated for with local unitary operations.

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Polarisation entangled source Horizontally polarised
photon pairs at 807.5 nm are generated via type 1 sponta-
neous parametric down conversion in a 1 mm thick BiBO
crystal, pumped by an 80 mW, 403.75 nm CW diode
laser. Both photons are rotated into a diagonal state
(|H(cid:105) +|V (cid:105)) by a half waveplate (HWP) with fast axis

at 22.5◦ from vertical. One photon has a phase applied by
two 45◦ quarter waveplates (QWP) either side of a HWP
at θ◦. The second photon has its diagonal state optimised
with a polarising beam splitter (PBS) at ∼ 45◦.

Both photons are collected in polarisation maintain-
ing ﬁbre (PMF) and are incident on both faces of a ﬁber
pigtailed PBS. When measuring in the coincidence ba-
(|H1V2(cid:105) +
sis, this post-selects the entangled state
eiφ|V1H2(cid:105)) where φ = 4(θ + ) and  is the intrinsic phase
applied by the whole system. The experimental setup is
illustrated in ﬁgure S1.
PMF is highly birefringent, resulting in full decoher-
ence of the polarisation state after ∼ 1 m of ﬁbre giving a
mixed state. In order to maintain polarisation superposi-
tion over several meters of ﬁber we use 90◦ connections to
ensure both polarisations propagate through equal pro-
portions of fast and slow axis ﬁbre. Slight length dif-
ferences between ﬁbres and temperature variations mean
the whole system applies a residual phase  to the state,
which can be compensated for in the source using the
phase controlling HWP.

Polarisation state tomography Polarisation state to-
mography combines statistics from projection measure-
ments to generate the density matrix of a state. Single
photon rotations are applied by a QWP and HWP before
a PBS. Single qubit tomography requires four measure-
ments and two qubit tomography requires 16. Acciden-
tal counts are removed by taking each reading with and

IV. ENTANGLED STATE FIDELITIES

Photon 1 of a polarisation entangled Bell state is in-
jected into each input of the PST waveguide array while
photon 2 is preserved in polarisation maintaining ﬁ-
bre. Polarisation tomography is performed on the out-
put state of each transfer and the ﬁdelity to the state
propagating through a reference straight waveguide cal-
culated in table S3. A characterised model of our device
is constructed using quantum state tomography. The
similarity between our measured output state and pre-
dicted output state is also calculated in table S3 for each
transfer.

We demonstrate PST applied to an entangled state of
varying purity. Purity is controlled through applying a
delay to one component of the polarisation qubit. Ta-
ble S4 presents the ﬁdelity of our measured state against
the same state propagation through the reference straight
waveguide. Decohered PST is performed on transfer from
waveguide 1 to waveguide 11.
