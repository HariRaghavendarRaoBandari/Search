Abstract: We revisit the sgoldstino interpretation of the diphoton excess in the context of
gauge mediation. While the bound on the gluino mass might seem to make the sgoldstino
contribution to the diphoton excess unobservable, we show that the interpretation is viable
in a thin, near critical region of the parameter space. This regime gives rise to drastic
departures from the standard gauge mediation picture. While the fermion messengers lie
in the (10–100) TeV range, some scalar messengers are signiﬁcantly lighter and are respon-
sible for the sgoldstino production and decay. Their eﬀective coupling to the sgoldstino
is correspondingly enhanced, and a non-perturbative regime is triggered when light and
heavy messenger masses diﬀer by a factor ∼ 4π. We also comment on the possible role of
an R-axion and on the possibility to decouple the sfermions in this context.

1 Introduction

The excess in the diphoton channel recently reported by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2]
experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at an invariant mass of approximately
750 GeV has prompted a variety of possible interpretations. The interpretation in terms
of the production and decay of a sgoldstino [3–7] places the underlying new physics into
the wider context of supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model (SM), thus going
beyond the mere parameterisation of the eﬀect in terms of ad hoc dynamics. In fact, the
very dynamics responsible for the generation of gluino and photino masses through the F -
term of the goldstino superﬁeld also provide, as a consequence of supersymmetry, a gluon
and a photon decay width for the sgoldstinos.

The connection between gaugino masses and decay widths is most easily illustrated in
terms of an eﬀective description of the interaction between the goldstino superﬁeld and the
SM gauge superﬁeld strengths W α

As we show below, the eﬀective description in eq. (1.2) can hardly account for the
diphoton excess in the context of concrete UV completions, in particular if gaugino masses
originate from gauge mediation. The problem is not apparent in the eﬀective description,
especially if the coeﬃcient of the eﬀective operator is expressed in terms of Ma/F , as in
eq. (1.2). The way out we present in this paper requires supersymmetry to be badly broken
F ∼ Λ, in which case the relevant
in the dynamics underlying the eﬀective interaction,
F (cid:28) Λ. The
eﬀects are not captured by the eﬀective description in eq. (1.2), valid for
problem, and its solution, are discussed in Sect. 3 (after a few preliminaries in Sect. 2), in
the simple case in which the operator in eq. (1.2) originates from a loop of chiral messengers,
as in minimal gauge mediation. The interpretation of the excess relies on the onset of a non-
perturbative regime, when approaching a critical point where one of the scalar messengers
becomes light.
In Sect. 4 we speculate on the possible role of such a regime in simple
models of supersymmetry breaking. In Sect. 5 and 6 we comment on the possible role of
an R-axion and of D-terms raising the sfermion masses well above the experimental limits.
In Section 7 we summarize and conclude.

√

2 The eﬀective description

In this section we take eq. (1.2) at face value and show how the size of the diphoton excess
translates into constraints on its parameters. A similar derivation was done in Refs. [3–7].

Although, needless to say, the very existence of the anomaly is not yet established, we
will assume that it corresponds to the production of a scalar resonance, identiﬁed with a
scalar component of X, decaying into two photons. The interaction in eq. (1.2) provides
the necessary ingredients for the production of the resonance through gluon fusion and its
decay into photons. We consider a reference value of σγγ ≡ σ(pp → s → γγ) = 8 fb for the
cross section at 13 TeV, see e.g. [8–13]. In the light of the presently uncertain experimental
situation, we do not aim at accounting for a possibly large width of the resonance.

As we will see, obtaining a large enough partial width Γ(s → γγ) ≡ Γγγ is not at
all trivial. Let us then conservatively consider the minimum value of Γγγ necessary to
account for the anomaly. It is easy to see that such a minimum value is obtained when
i) γγ and the partons pp involved in the production are the only decay channels, so that
Γtot = Γγγ + Γpp, ii) Γpp dominates the width, and iii) the resonance is produced through

gluon fusion (pp = gg). Which happen to be quite plausible conditions. Then, one gets 1

(2.3)

In this eﬀective approach, the size of the diphoton excess points to a very low scale of
supersymmetry breaking. It is not easy to deal with such a low scale, as we expect gauge
mediation to provide the main source of gaugino masses at this scale and gaugino masses
to be loop suppressed, as we discuss in the next Section.

3 A simple ultraviolet completion

Let us now discuss in greater detail the interpretation of the diphoton anomaly taking
into account the origin of the eﬀective interaction in eq. (1.2). We assume that gaugino
masses are obtained at the one loop level through the exchange of messenger superﬁelds,
directly coupled to supersymmetry breaking, in vectorlike representation of the SM group
GSM, as in minimal gauge mediation. Note that on general grounds [4, 11, 12, 18–27], the
interpretations of the diphoton anomaly also requires the existence of vectorlike ﬁelds, on
top of the 750 GeV resonance, mediating its production and decay. The gauge mediation
messengers play precisely that role, thus providing a wider context for the existence of the
vectorlike ﬁelds as well.

To be speciﬁc, we add to the minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM) ﬁeld content a

chiral superﬁeld X, with non-vanishing scalar and F -term vevs

X = x +

2ψθ + f θ2,

(cid:104)X(cid:105) = M + F θ2,

(3.1)

The vev of X plays the role of the supersymetry breaking spurion of minimal gauge me-
diation (M and F can be taken positive without loss of generality). On top of that, the
dynamical degrees of freedom of X also play a role here. In particular, the 750 GeV res-
onance will be associated to the real scalar s. Both s and a are assumed for simplicity
to be mass eigenstates. The origin of the supersymmetry breaking masses of s and a is
a model-depedent issue, which we will not investigate in this Section. As mentioned, if
F were the only source of supersymmetry breaking, ψ would be the goldstino and x the

sgoldstino. We also add messenger superﬁelds Φi, ¯Φi in irreducible, conjugated (possibly
real) representations of the SM group. In order to generate one-loop masses for the three
gauginos, the messengers should have non-trivial transformations under all the three SM
gauge factors. They are coupled to supersymmetry breaking through X only,

(cid:90)

LΦ =

dθ2 λiXΦiΦi + h.c.,

(3.2)

where the coupling can be taken diagonal and positive without loss of generality. In the
following, we will denote by λm the minimum value of the couplings λi (at the messenger
scale).

Gaugino masses arise from eq. (3.2) through the standard gauge mediation mechanism.
Sfermion masses also get a contribution from eq. (3.2), which however is not necessarily the
only, nor the dominant, one (see e.g. Sect. 6). We will therefore assume that the sfermions
do not play a role in the diphoton anomaly.

Let us now discuss whether the diphoton excess can be accounted for in this setup.
Before discussing the scenario we are interested in, in which F ∼ λM 2, we show that this
is not possible in the F (cid:28) λM 2 limit.

3.1 F (cid:28) λM 2
In the limit where F (cid:28) λmM 2, supersymmetry breaking can be neglected when integrating
out the messengers Φi + Φi, whose fermion and scalar components all have masses close to
λiM . The eﬀective interaction in eq. (1.2) follows, with

where a labels the factor of the SM group (U(1)Y , SU(2)L, SU(3)c respectively), and
i Na,i, and Na,i is the corresponding Dynkin index of Φi + Φi. For instance, if the
messengers form complete SU(5) multiplets, Na = 1 for a 5 + 5 and Na = 3 for a 10 + 10.
It is now easy to show that the numerical results obtained in the previous Section are
not phenomenologically viable in this context. The explicit expression of the photino mass

latter2 require relatively large values of the Dynkin index. Such values can be achieved in
the presence of a rich enough set of messengers. For example, a full family of messengers,
ﬁlling a 5 + 10 representation of SU(5), would give Nγ = 32/3, and λm > 1.5 would suﬃce
to allow TeV scale messengers.

The problem arises from the gaugino masses, the gluino mass M3 in particular. Being
loop suppressed with respect to the messenger masses Mm, the experimental bound on M3
forces Mm to be in the O (100 TeV) region, barring unrealistic values of N3. We have in
fact

(3.7)

When plugged in eq. (3.6), such large messenger masses require unrealistic values of Nγ.

In the expressions above, we have assumed that only s contributes to the diphoton
anomaly. The possibility that both s and a contribute is often considered, also in connection
to the possibility of explaining a possibly sizeable width of the 750 GeV resonance [3, 6, 7].
The presence of both contributions would enhance the photon width by a factor of two,
but would not change our conclusions.
3.2 F ∼ λM 2
Drastic departures from the grim predictions of the previous subsection arise in the regime
in which supersymmetry breaking is sizeable, and the eﬀective description in eq. (1.2) does
not apply. In order to obtain the expressions for the partial widths Γγγ, Γgg in this regime,
we ﬁrst write the relevant interactions. Omitting for simplicity the messenger index i, the
mass terms for the fermion (ψ, ¯ψ) and scalar (φ, ¯φ) components of the messengers Φ, ¯Φ
are

2The experimental bounds on the mass of the lightest messengers depend on their decay mode. One
possibility is that they decay through a small coupling to the MSSM ﬁelds. For example, this is the case if
the presence of a superpotential interaction WLQ = ¯ΦQL. Then, at TeV energies these interactions lead to
leptoquark type couplings involving the lightest ﬁelds φl. The lower bounds on the their mass are around
650 GeV [28, 29]. In various instances below we consider higher multiplicities in the number of messengers,
therefore leading to higher multipliciites of the leptoquark couplings. We will therefore use 1 TeV as a
reference lower bound.

In particular, the decay widths of s (but not of a) get a contribution from trilinear inter-
h,l = λ2M 2 ± λF . Parametrically, the

(3.11)

The crucial observation is that there exists a small region of the parameter space, near the
critical point M = F/λ, where the lighter scalar messenger is signiﬁcantly lighter than its
natural scale Mm, and its eﬀective coupling to the scalar resonance s is correspondingly
enhanced. This is the regime in which the interpretation of the diphoton excess has a
chance to be phenomenologically viable, and that we will study in detail. We will call it
the “near-critical” regime. When the enhancement becomes very large, the system enters
a strongly interacting regime.

A few comments are in order.
• In the near-critical regime, supersymmetry is maximally broken, F ≈ λM , and the
dynamics is far from being described, even qualitatively, by the eﬀective approach in
eq. (1.2).

• The near-critical region is ﬁne-tuned, as F and λM need to be close, with the ﬁne-
tuning parameter given by ∆ = (Mm/ml)2 = (geﬀ/λ)2. In Sect. 4 we will speculate
on a possible dynamical origin of such a degeneracy.

• A lower bound to the potential is guaranteed by supersymmetry, independently of
the size of the trilinear coupling. Assuming the potential is stabilised in a nearly
critical point, we expect the minimum to be meta-stable.

• In the near-critical regime, the gaugino masses are not drastically enhanced, for given
M (a moderate enhancement comes from the F ∼ λM 2 corrections to the standard
F (cid:28) λM 2 expressions). On the other hand, the diphoton anomaly is controlled by
the lightest scalar messenger, and it is now possible to keep its mass light (to get a
sizeable diphoton signal) while allowing M to be much larger (to get a gluino mass
above experimental bound).

• In the presence of multiple messengers, if none of the couplings λi are (approximately)
degenerate, only one messenger, the one with λi = λm, can beneﬁt from an enhanced
coupling. On the other hand, in the presence of an (approximate) degeneracy of
diﬀerent λi, e.g. consequence of a symmetry, more scalar messengers can be light
at the same time. Such a degeneracy should involve messenger with same quantum
numbers under the SM gauge group, as gauge radiative corrections could otherwise
spoil the degeneracy. For example, in the context of uniﬁed theories, the diﬀerent
SM components of a uniﬁed multiplet would have equal couplings λi at the grand
uniﬁcation (GUT) scale, but the diﬀerent RGE running would lift the degeneracy at
low energy.

The broad picture that emerges has therefore: a resonance at 750 GeV associated to
the sgoldstino s; a messenger scale Mm of a few tens of TeV, so that the loop suppressed
gluino mass can be above the experimental bound; a number of messengers (with same
SM quantum numbers) with a near critical coupling λ ≈ F/M 2 with an anomalously light
scalar component (at the 1–2 TeV scale), responsible of the production and decay of the
∼ 750 GeV resonance, and with all the other components at the scale Mm; TeV scale
gaugino masses generated by both light and heavy messengers. With this broad picture in
mind, let us now proceed to a more detailed discussion.

The general one-loop expressions for the partial decay widths into gluons and photons
of s and a, due to the loop of scalar and fermion messengers are given in the Appendix.
There, we also provide the expressions for the decays into ZZ, Zγ, W W . The decay into
two Higgses is absent at the one-loop level. In the limit in which the sgoldstino is lighter
than the messengers, m2

As mentioned, we expect M to be of order of a few tens of TeV or more, in order for the loop
suppressed gluino mass to be above the experimental bounds. Eqs. (3.12)–(3.15) then show
that the ﬁeld a cannot play a role in the diphoton anomaly, as the corresponding widths
are suppressed by M 2. Hence in this context a possibly sizeable width of the diphoton
resonance cannot be explained in terms of the production of two resonances close in mass
associated to the ﬁelds s and a [3, 6, 7]. On the other hand, when ml is around the TeV
scale, the corresponding terms in eqs. (3.12) and (3.14) dominate and we have

through the additional factor (λ2
mM/ml)2, which corresponds to an enhanced eﬀective
coupling geﬀ, see eq. (3.11). To get a feeling of the size of the eﬀect, we observe that the
same enhancement could be obtained in the case of a standard fermion loop (with same
SM quantum numbers, mass, and in the same limit used in eqs. (3.16) and (3.17)) using a
Yukawa coupling λf = λ2

mM/(4ml) (with the Yukawa normalised as in eq. (3.10)).

Note that λ2

mM cannot be taken arbitrarily larger than ml, as the light messenger
interactions become non-perturbative for large geﬀ. The qualitative naive dimensional
analysis (NDA) estimate of the onset of the strongly interacting regime is

geﬀ ∼ g∗

eﬀ ≡ 4π.

As a consequence, we are only allowed to consider values of the heavy messenger scale
bound by Mm (cid:46) (g∗
eﬀ/λm)ml. Notice in particular that lowering λm allows to rise the
upper bound on Mm. 3

For completeness, let us exemplify the discussion above in a simple setup. We consider
a set of n messenger pairs V + ¯V with SM quantum numbers (3, 2)−5/6 + (¯3, 2)5/6. In the
left hand side of Fig. 1 we show the values of the gluino mass (green) and of the mass of the

normalization δL =

and d the length of the representation. Although the bound is obtained under the assumption ml (cid:29) ms, a
similar bound can be obtained for ml (cid:28) ms.

Appendix.

The lower bound on the gluino mass (M3 (cid:38) 1.7 TeV) requires increasing F/M , while M
needs to be increased accordingly in order to keep a constant signal strength, see eqs. (3.16)
and (3.17). In fact, the plot shows that the parameters of the theory are pushed into the
near-critical regime F/(λM 2) ≈ 1 for realistic gluino and messenger masses. In the right
hand side of Fig. 1 we zoom into the critical region. We ﬁnd that, as long as we accept
a signiﬁcant tuning, this toy example is able to both ﬁt the signal and exceed the present
lower bounds on scalar messengers and gluinos.

On the other hand, the plot shows that in the eﬀective regime, i.e. for F (cid:28) λM 2,
the gluino mass cannot be accounted for. For high enough n, the plot in Fig. 1 is only
indicative, as the theory presents close Landau poles in both the running of λ and the
gauge couplings, which is discussed in detail in Sec. 3.4. Also notice that for F/(λM 2)
close enough to 1 the trilinear coupling become non-perturbative geﬀ ∼ g∗
eﬀ.

3.3 Quantitative analysis

Let us now show quantitatively that the diphoton excess can indeed be reproduced while
keeping ml and M3 above the experimental limits. As mentioned, the excess is controlled by
ml, while gaugino masses depend on Mm. We want to keep ml around the TeV scale, above
its experimental bound, which helps ﬁtting the excess. Unlike in the case of Sect. 3.1, this
does not make the gluino mass unacceptably small, as we can now take Mm signiﬁcantly
heavier. Using eq. (3.17) and (2.1), we ﬁnd that ﬁtting the diphoton excess requires

In order to keep geﬀ below g∗
eﬀ, while keeping ml (cid:38) 1 TeV, the messengers with light scalar
components should have ¯Nγ (cid:38) 8. We will discuss examples in Sect. 3.4. Making the
eﬀective coupling geﬀ large only gives a moderate gain with respect to the case in Sect. 3.1.
Infact, the results for the diphoton cross section are the same (for equal mass and SM
quantum numbers of the relevant degrees of freedom) when geﬀ = 6 λm, and the factor 6
limits the gain.

On the other hand, the previously hopeless situation with the gluino mass is now
completely diﬀerent. To start with, the standard expression in eq. (3.3) for the gluino mass
gets a O (1) enhancement in the F ∼ λM 2 regime. In the near-critical region, F ≈ λM 2,
the enhancement is given by a factor log 4 ≈ 1.4. Also, extra messengers not in the near-
critical regime can contribute to the gluino mass, while being negligible in the diphoton
signal. We therefore have

We therefore conclude that we can make M3 large enough, while not exceeding the NDA

smaller values of λm help with perturbativity.

3.4 Examples
Let us discuss a few examples of viable messenger ﬁeld content, leading to geﬀ (cid:46) g∗
eﬀ in
eqs. (3.19,3.22). As mentioned, we prefer the near-critical messengers Φi to be given by
n copies of the same SM irreducible representation, to guarantee that the near-equality of
their coupling to X, possibly consequence of a symmetry, is not spoiled by gauge radiative
corrections. In order to induce the diphoton signal, we need them to be colored and elec-
trically charged. Other, non-critical, messengers can also be around. Their contribution
to the diphoton signal will be negligible, but they can play a role in gauge coupling uniﬁ-
cation. On the other hand, if a Landau pole for the gauge coupling is to be avoided below
the GUT scale, the total number of messengers cannot be too large.

Diﬀerent model building avenues are available, depending on whether or not one aims
at the perturbativity of gauge couplings up to the GUT scale and at gauge coupling uniﬁca-
tion. If the perturbativity of gauge couplings is not an issue, the bounds in eqs. (3.19,3.22)
can be easily satisﬁed while maintaining the light scalar interactions semi-perturbative. Let
us then aim at models with perturbative gauge couplings up to the GUT scale (see [30, 31]
for a related discussion). This requires N1, N2, N3 (cid:46) 5, where Na are the Dynkin indices
of all messengers (near-critical and not).

If gauge coupling uniﬁcation is not an issue, extra, non near-critical superﬁelds are
not required, and we can assume ¯Ni = Ni. Addressing the gluino mass constraints while
keeping geﬀ under control is not an issue: the UV perturbativity condition N3 (cid:46) 5 is always
compatible with geﬀ < g∗
eﬀ, in eq. (3.22), for an appropriate value of λm. The only drawback
of a smaller λm is the higher ﬁne-tuning necessary for near-criticality. As for ﬁtting the
signal strength, the relation ¯Nγ = ¯N2 + (5/3) ¯N1 shows that one can obtain relatively large
values of Nγ in eq. (3.19) while keeping N1, N2 < 5.

c

To stick to known SM representations, let us consider as a ﬁrst example n copies of
U c + U
, where U c has the same quantum numbers as the SM up quark singlets. The
Dynkin indices are (N1, N2, N3) = n (8/5, 0, 1). As the perturbativity of g1 forces n ≤ 3,
we can take n = 3. We then have N3 = 3 in eq. (3.22), which, for M3 − ∆M3 = ml, is
compatible with geﬀ < g∗
eﬀ when λm (cid:46) 0.4. As for eq. (3.19), the three copies of U c + U
give Nγ = 8, which is compatible with geﬀ (cid:46) g∗
eﬀ.

c

A second example, involving a SM representation included in the adjoint of SU(5),
is the case of n copies of V + V , where V is a fundamental of SU(3)c and SU(2)L with
hypercharge Y = −5/6. The Dynkin indices are (N1, N2, N3) = n (5, 3, 2). As the pertur-
bativity of g1 forces n ≤ 1, we take n = 1. We then have N3 = 2 in eq. (3.22), which, for

In Fig. 2 we show two plots with contour lines in the (M3, ml)-plane corresponding
to diﬀerent values of λm ﬁtting the signal. The plots are done with the one-loop formulas
given in the Appendix. On the left hand side for n = 3 copies of U c + ¯U c ﬁelds, and as
discussed above for this choice of parameters the model is on the edge of non-perturbativity,
shown with a dashed curve. On the right hand side the plot is done for one set of V + ¯V
messengers in the adjoint of SU(5).

The two above examples have diﬀerent predictions for the pp → γZ, ZZ, W W rates.
The ﬁrst example (U c + ¯U c) predicts them to be well below the present limits: ΓZZ/Γγγ ≈
0.08, ΓZγ/Γγγ ≈ 0.6. The second example (V + ¯V ) predicts higher rates, but also below the
present experimental limits, with an accidental suppression of the Zγ rate: ΓZZ/Γγγ ≈ 1.3,
ΓZγ/Γγγ ≈ 0.02, ΓW W /Γγγ ≈ 2.8. The previous ratios have been obtained using the
formulas in the Appendix.

Neither of the previous examples preserves the successful gauge coupling uniﬁcation
achieved in the MSSM. The simplest way to preserve uniﬁcation is to add extra ﬁelds (non
near-critical) so that the messengers form complete SU(5) multiplets. This is possible only
for the second example. The ﬁrst example would require completing the 3× (U c + U
) into
3×(10+10) of SU(5). In this case, however, the total Dynkin would be N1 = N2 = N3 = 9,
well above what perturbative gauge uniﬁcation requires.

c

The second example, on the other hand, requires completing V + V to a full SU(5)
In

adjoint, with N1 = N2 = N3 = 5, at the boundary of gauge coupling uniﬁcation.

– 11 –

this case, the ﬁelds V + V are accompanied by an adjoint of SU(3)c, Σ, an adjoint of
SU(2)L, W , and a singlet. If X is a singlet of SU(5), the λ couplings of those ﬁelds are
the same at the GUT scale, λV = λΣ = λW . The RGE running to low energies makes the
triplet coupling λW lower than λV , which prevents V + V from being near-critical (only
the triplet can be). On the other hand, if X is the singlet component of a SU(5) adjoint,
then λV = λW /6 = λΣ/4 at the GUT scale. For perturbative values of the couplings at
the GUT scale, λV remains the smallest coupling during the whole running, and V + V
can play the role of the near-critical ﬁelds.4 In this scenario, the uniﬁcation prediction for
α3(MZ) is shifted by ∆α3 ≈ −0.008 with respect to the MSSM prediction, in the direction
of the measured value.

Other solutions can be obtained in the context of ﬂipped SU(5) [32, 33] or using
messenger spectra that preserve gauge coupling uniﬁcation but are not in full SU(5) mul-
tiplets [34].

In summary, it is possible to choose a messenger spectrum such that the bounds in
eqs. (3.19,3.22) are satisﬁed with geﬀ < g∗
eﬀ and that gauge couplings are perturbative up to
the GUT scale, where they unify. The simplest example we found is the case of messengers
forming a whole adjoint representation of SU(5), with the Y (cid:54)= 0 components near-critical
and the Y = 0 components oﬀ near-criticality.

3.5 Strong coupling

From the discussion of possible models in the previous Section, the following dichotomy
emerges between UV and IR non-perturbativity. On one side, one can choose to have
large representations or a large number of messenger ﬁelds. This allows to interpret the
diphoton excess at the expense of Landau poles at some tens or hundreds of TeVs, thus
having strong dynamics in the UV, but a weakly coupled EFT at TeV energies.

On the other side, one can avoid Landau poles by incorporating a smaller number of
messenger ﬁelds, at the expense of strong dynamics in the IR, since the trilinear λm has
to be tuned close to criticality. As an infrared eﬀect, it does not give rise to Landau poles
and it does not spoil the nice UV properties of supersymmetric theories.

In the IR non-perturbative regime, the numerical results showed above may receive
large corrections. Moreover, the trilinear interaction leads to an attractive force between
the light scalar messengers and, in the IR strong coupling regime geﬀ (cid:38) g∗
eﬀ, one expects a
tower of bound states. In fact, a similar phenomenon is argued to happen in the MSSM
if the trilinear interaction AtH ˜qL ˜uR becomes strong [35]. Thus we expect that the light
scalar messengers form an S-wave color-singlet bound state Sb. The resonance Sb would
be a tightly bound state, as the binding energy is controlled by ml. And it would be a
true bound state, as the formation time is controlled by the inverse of the binding energy,
and the decay by perturbative QCD interactions. Then, the bound state Sb would mix
with the sgoldstino and, since the constituents of Sb are colored, this would give rise to a
direct coupling between gluons and the physical state. To our knowledge, the details of

4The adjoint containing V + ¯V also contains a gauge singlet. Its Yukawa coupling is likely to be the
smallest one at low energy. Therefore, when V + ¯V is near critical, the singlet will be in the broken phase
and develop a vev. This is not a problem, as the vev would not break the SM gauge symmetry.

(cid:104)x(cid:105). The tree-level potential in the pseudo-ﬂat direction is plotted with a dashed line. The shaded
region corresponds to the region of near-criticality (the size is largely exagerated).

the phenomenology and the interplay of the sgoldstino and the possible singlet resonance
is far from settled. It would be interesting to further explore such phenomenology, perhaps
through lattice techniques, especially if in the future the sgoldstino scenario near criticality
will gain further support from the experiments.

4 Speculations on the origin of the near-critical regime
The near-critical regime requires an apparent ﬁne-tuning making ml (cid:28) λM and enhancing
geﬀ in eq. (3.11). In this Section, we speculate on a possible connection between a dynamical
origin of near-criticality and the strong regime it induces.

Let us consider the simplest possible completion of the basic model building block
considered in the previous Section, eq. (3.2). The gauge group is GSM. Besides the MSSM
ones, the chiral superﬁelds are X and a vectorlike set of messengers Φ + ¯Φ. For simplicity,
we take Φ in a single irreducible SM representation. The superpotential is

W = WMSSM + λXΦ ¯Φ − F X,

(4.1)

system has two phases, controlled by the scalar vev of x, (cid:104)x(cid:105) = M , which can also be taken

where λ > 0, F > 0 with no loss of generality. While the above system is simple and well
known, we are not aware of a thorough discussion of its behaviour near the critical point.
Let us remind the main features of the above system. We expand X as in eq. (3.1).

Then the system has a supersymmetric minimum for (cid:104)x(cid:105) = 0, |(cid:104)Φ(cid:105)| = |(cid:10) ¯Φ(cid:11)| =(cid:112)F/λ. The
real and non-negative. When M >(cid:112)F/λ, the critical point, the messengers have no vev,
hand, when M <(cid:112)F/λ, both messengers get a vev of size |(cid:104)Φ(cid:105)| = |(cid:10) ¯Φ(cid:11)| =(cid:112)F/λ − M 2

the gauge symmetry is unbroken, and supersymmetry is broken by the F -term vev of X,
(cid:104)f(cid:105) = F . In such an unbroken phase, the tree level potential is ﬂat, V = F 2. On the other

and the potential, as a function of M , is

V = F 2 − (F − λM 2)2,

(4.2)

– 13 –

FΛx(cid:61)MF2Vwhich forces M = 0, where the potential has its absolute minimum, the gauge symmetry
if broken, and supersymmetry is unbroken.

On the left of the critical point, M < (cid:112)F/λ, the tree level potential provides a
nearly ﬂat). On the right side, on the other hand, the ﬂat direction for M > (cid:112)F/λ is

suﬃciently accurate description (except perhaps very near the critical point, where it is

lifted by the one-loop correction to the potential, which acquires a positive slope and let
M slide towards the critical point, see Fig. 3.

In a region around the critical point, though, the system hides a non-perturbative
regime, triggered by the growth of the coupling in eq. (3.11). Interestingly, this happens
only in a tiny region, characterised by

λM 2 − F (cid:46) F

(4π)2 .

(4.3)

We can then speculate on the possibility that the eﬀective potential generated by strong
interactions has a negative slope in some point of the near-critical region.
If that were
the case, a metastable minimum would be generated for the potential in the near-critical
region, thus providing a dynamical origin for the apparently ﬁne-tuned closeness of λM 2
and F (and for the origin of supersymmetry breaking). But this is of course just wishful
thinking. Still, we consider worth pointing out the existence of an ephemeral, but poten-
tially interesting, non-perturbative regime in a simple and well known model, which might
deserve further investigation.

If it stabilised in the in the near-critical region, the system we considered has an
obvious, spontaneously broken R-symmetry. The phase of x would play the role of the
R-axion and would be massless, up to supergravity R-breaking corrections. In the next
Section, we will make a few considerations on the possible implications of such a light
R-axion, in a more general context.

5 The R-axion

The discussion in Sect. 3 assumed that the only relevant interactions of the diphoton
resonance are the ones with the messengers in eq. (3.2). On the other hand, the hidden
sector dynamics can in principle give rise to alternative decay channels that could compete
with the photon and gluon ones, thus aﬀecting our phenomenological analysis. However,
it is not unreasonable to assume that most of the hidden degrees of freedom are irrelevant
because characterised by large, O(

F ) masses.

√

s/F 2|X|4(cid:12)(cid:12)D leads to a decay of the

Even if that is the case, there are two possible decay channels that can not be ignored.

First, the SUSY breaking mass of the sgoldstino m2
sgoldstino into two goldstinos. Such a decay is negligible with respect to Γ(s → γγ),
see eq. (3.17), in the regions of parameter space that we consider. Then, a wide class of
supersymmetry breaking models predicts the existence of a light degree of freedom, the
R-axion, which could be relevant. In this Section, we shortly outline the possible role of
a light R-axion in the diphoton phenomenology. The R-symmetry plays a central role in
most supersymmetry breaking models. If present, its spontaneous breaking is welcome to

allow for Majorana gaugino masses. The R-axion is the Goldstone associated to such a
spontaneous breaking. As such, it is massless, up to the small explicit breaking of the R-
symmetry provided by supergravity [36]. Which give it a mass that, in our parameter space,
is O (100 MeV) [37], with a non-negligible dependence on the hidden sector dynamics. If X
is the only source of spontaneous R-symmetry breaking, as in the toy model in the previous
2M )
Section, the R-axion is the phase a of its scalar component, x = (M + s/
(where with an abuse of notations we are using the same notations for the ﬁelds s, a that
we used for their linearised versions in eq. (3.1)). In general, the R-axion will have at least
a component in a, if X has a non-vanishing R-charge. For simplicity, and to maximise
the role of the R-axion in the diphoton phenomenology, we will assume that the R-axion
coincides with a.

The radial component s, i.e. the ∼ 750 GeV resonance, can then decay into two R-

(5.1)

Depending on the subsequent fate of the R-axion and on the relative size of the above width
and the gg, γγ ones, the above channel, if present, can aﬀect the discussion in Sect. 3.

The mass of the R-axion is in the ballpark of the pion mass. If ma > 2mπ, it will
dominantly decay into two pions. 5 If ma < 2mπ, the relevant channels are R-axion decays
into two photons, electrons or muons. The lepton decays are proportional to ma(mf /M )2,
see Ref. [37], and can be suppressed with respect to the decay into photons for the messenger
mass scales that we consider. Then, the decay into two photons is in principle relevant,
as the values of the R-axion mass just happens to be in the window in which the two
photons are collimated enough to be seen at the LHC as a single photon [9, 14, 38–47]. As
a consequence, the decay s → aa could in principle also account for the diphoton signal,
through the subsequent decay of the R-axions into two collimated photons. Unfortunately,
the lifetime of the R-axion is too long for the decay to take place before hitting the detector.
In order for the two photons to be collimated enough, the mass of the R-axion should
conservatively be below 200 MeV, and this is already in tension the possibility that the
decay is induced by dynamics at the TeV scale [14]. As in our case the decay is induced by
dynamics at the few O (10 TeV) scale (unlike the resonance s, the R-axion has no trilinear
couplding to the light scalar messengers, eq. (3.10)), there is no chance that it will be
fast enough to give rise to the diphoton signal. Except if the R-axion mass happens to
be very close to the pion mass (or the η mass, but that value of the masses might be too
large [14]) [43, 44]. In the latter case, a non-negligible mixing with the pion would allow
the R-axion to decay as a pion, well before hitting the detector. In summary, the fate of
the R-axion is either to contribute to the invisible width of s or, in a ﬁne-tuned window
for its mass, to contribute to the diphoton signal.

As for the relative size of the widths, the gg and γγ widths are suppressed by a loop
factor, compared to eq. (5.1), but the aa width is suppressed by a higher scale, M 2 versus
m2
l . The relative sizes of the widths then depends on the speciﬁc values of the parameters

5The R-axion decay into two gravitinos is very much suppressed in our region of parameter space [36, 37].

6 Sfermion masses and D-terms

In the previous Section, we have ignored the MSSM sfermions. On the other hand, if the
only contribution to their mass was the minimal gauge mediation two-loop contribution
that follows from eq. (3.2), we would expect the colored sfermions to be lighter than the
gluino, in which case they would play a role at least in forcing the whole spectrum to be
heavier in order to pass the experimental bounds. In this Section we show that i) it is
indeed easy to split the spectrum and make the sfermions parametrically heavier than the
gauginos, so that they do not play a role in the diphoton phenomenology, and ii) the model
building ingredients needed to make them heavy modify the dynamics discussed in Sect. 3,
but have a minor impact on the conclusions.

In order to make the sfermions parametrically heavier than the gauginos it suﬃces to
make both X and the sfermions charged under a (non-anomalous) U(1)X gauge factor. As

they couple to X, the messengers are then also charged under X. The vev of X breaks
U(1)X and supersymmetry at the same time. As a consequence, the sfermions (and the
scalar messenger, or “smessengers”) get tree-level soft masses from the U(1)X D-term,
parametrically larger than the loop-induced gaugino masses. In the near critical regime,
in which, as we will see, we still have F ∼ λ2M , the D-term contribution to the soft mass
of the scalar ϕ (sfermion or smessenger), m2
ϕ, is of the order of the heavy messenger scale,

ϕ = qϕ gX D ∼ F 2
m2

M 2 ∼ λ2M 2 = M 2

m,

(6.1)

where qϕ is the U(1)X charge of the scalar ﬁeld, gX the gauge coupling, and D the D-term.
With Mm in the (10–100) TeV range, we are dealing with a simple realisation of the split
supersymmetry spectrum [48–50] 6.

The large soft terms have a relevant impact on both sfermions and smessengers dy-
namics. The sfermions are too heavy to aﬀect the diphoton phenomenology, as desired.
In order for them not to be tachyonic, their U(1)X charges need to have the same sign as
the D-term, say positive for deﬁnitess. As U(1)X is non-anomalous, the supertrace must
vanish, and the tree-level scalar soft masses must add up to zero. The positiveness of the
MSSM sfermion masses hence forces negative soft mass terms for some scalars. This had
long been considered as an obstacle to tree-level mediation of supersymmetry breaking in
non-anomalous, renormalizable theories. But it is not: the messengers are anyway forced
to have (overall) negative soft mass terms, as they couple to a positively charged ﬁeld (see
below). That does not make them tachyonic, as the negative soft mass term is compensated
by the positive, supersymmetric, mass term. And their soft mass can compensate the posi-
tive sfermion soft masses. Such a class of models, in which the sfermions with negative soft
masses needed to satisfy the supertrace constraint get a large, positive, supersymmetric
mass term from U(1)X breaking and play the role of chiral messengers of minimal gauge
mediation has been studied in Refs. [51–53]. The compensation, i.e. anomaly cancellation,
can arise automatically if the U(1)X is embedded in non-abelian gauge groups.

Let us now consider the impact of the new D-term contributions on the smessenger
dynamics, and show that the conclusions obtained in Sect. 3 are unchanged. Let qX = 1 be
the charge of X 7, −q, −¯q the charges of Φ, Φ (neglecting again the messenger ﬂavour index

The diphoton signal is not aﬀected by the D-term contributions to the smessenger
masses. The angle describing the mixing in the smessenger sector, now possibly diﬀerent
from π/4, does not enter the relevant trilinear interactions, which still have the form in
eq. (3.10). The decay widths are therefore unchanged (for given ml), in the near critical
limit in which the light smessenger exchange dominates the diphoton signal. In particular,
the eﬀective coupling of the resonance to the light smessenger is still given by eq. (3.11).

On the other hand, the D-term has a mild eﬀect on the relation of the gluino mass to

the smessenger masses. We have in fact

and Mm = (geﬀ/λ)ml, as before. For r → 0 (and ∆M3 = 0), eq. (6.8) reproduces eq. (3.20).
Numerically, for given ml and geﬀ, the presence of D-terms, i.e. of a non-zero r, gives only
slightly lower values of gluino masses. We therefore conclude that in the discussion of Sect. 3
the sfermions can be easily made heavy, without signiﬁcantly modifying the conclusions
about the possibility to ﬁt the signal within the constraints. On the other hand, the mixing
in eq. (6.6), if not maximal, could induce a decay s → hh. In order to avoid that, it suﬃces
to give Φ and ¯Φ the same charge under U(1)X , q = ¯q = 1/2. This is certainly the case in
the V + ¯V example of Sect. 3.4, as both ﬁelds originate from the same adjoint.

7 Summary and outlook

We have revisited the possibility to associate the recently reported diphoton excess to the
production of a sgoldstino of about 750 GeV. In this context, the new degree of freedom
is not an ad hoc degree of freedom, it is ordered by the need to break supersymmetry,
in the context of a theory with its own appeal; and the experiment measures the scale of
mediation of supersymmetry breaking, which turns out to be very low, O (100 TeV) or less.
We assumed that supersymmetry breaking, and thus the sgoldstino resonance, is cou-
pled to the MSSM ﬁelds through gauge mediation, which is appropriate at such low scales.
The messenger superﬁelds then provide the additional degrees of freedom needed for the
decay and production of the resonance.

We showed that the experimental bounds on gaugino masses force the messenger scale
Mm to be ∼ (10–100) TeV and thus make the sgoldstino contribution to the diphoton
excess unobservable, for a reasonable messenger content; except in a small region of the
parameter space near the critical point beyond which the messengers get a vev, F ≈ λM 2.
The phenomenology in this thin, nearly-critical region drastically departs from the
standard gauge mediation picture. One (or more) of the scalar messengers becomes much
lighter than the heavy messenger scale. It can therefore lie at the TeV scale, as needed
to account for the diphoton excess. At the same time, when the messenger becomes much
lighter than Mm, its eﬀective trilinear coupling gets enhanced by a factor λMm/ml, where
ml is the light messenger mass, thus further helping to account for the excess. When the
enhancement becomes very large, the system enters a strongly interacting regime. It is
then not possible to further raise the gain through a larger hierarchy between the heavy
and light messengers.

The IR non-perturbativity found at small ml (cid:28) Mm, associated to a large irrelevant
coupling, is of quite a diﬀerent nature than the usual UV non-perturbativity associated
to irrelevant or marginal coupling. As an infrared eﬀect, it does not give rise to Landau
poles and it does not spoil the UV properties of supersymmetric theories. A quantitative
analysis of the possibility to account for the diphoton eﬀect showed a dychotomy between
those two regimes. On the one hand, it is possible to account for the diphoton excess
while avoiding the IR strong coupling by using a large enough set of messenger ﬁelds. This
however forces Landau poles well below the GUT scale, and thus strong dynamics in the
UV. On the other hand, it is possible to maintain the theory perturbative in the UV (up to
the GUT scale) by having a lower number of messengers, but that forces a large trilinear
coupling and induces strong dynamics in the IR.

The IR regime is particularly intriguing. It requires the system to be in a ﬁne-tuned
near-critical region, where the determinant of the scalar messenger mass matrix is small.
In the context of the simplest possible structure of the hidden sector, Whidden = F X, we
observed that the near critical region is located on one end of the metastable ﬂat direction
associated to X, i.e. around the critical point, before the cascade to the supersymmetric
minimum. The shape of the loop corrected eﬀective potential along the ﬂat direction is
well known, it slowly pushes X towards the cascade. On the other hand, because of the
non-perturbative regime arising there, the shape of the potential in the near critical region

– 19 –

is not obvious. The obvious speculation is then that a metastable minimum could form
in the near-critical region, thus providing a dynamical origin for the apparent ﬁne-tuning
we need, and for the origin of supersymmetry breaking. But this is of course just wishful
thinking. In any case, an investigation of that region with non-perturbative methods would
be welcome.

Back to phenomenology, we did not aim at accounting for a possibly large width of
the resonance, relying of the presently uncertain experimental situation. In particular, the
known interpretation of an apparent width in terms of the production of two resonances
close in mass, identiﬁed with the scalar and pseudoscalar components of the sgoldstino, is
not available here, as the pseudoscalar component has no (enhanced) trilinear coupling to
the messengers.

In passing, we have commented on the role of a possible R-axion in the analysis of
the diphoton excess. In this setup, the R-axion mass is in the ballpark of the pion mass.
That is the window in which the decay of the sgoldstino into two R-axions, followed by the
subsequent decay of each R-axion into two collimated photons, would mimic a diphoton
signal. On the other hand, the lifetime of the R-axion would be too long for it to decay
before the detector, except when a sizeable mixing with the pion arises.

Finally, we have shown that it is possible to give the sfermions a mass parametrically
larger than the gauginos ones, so that they have no impact on our discussion, without
altering our conclusions.
