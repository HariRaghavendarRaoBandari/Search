Abstract

In the paper a theoretical study of critical (Curie) temperature TC of diluted ferromagnet based

on multilayer graphene (or graphite) with hydrogen adatoms deposited over carbon atoms belong-

ing to single sublattice is presented. The calculations are performed within Pair Approximation

(PA) for diluted ferromagnetic systems with long-range interactions. The method is able to take

into account the spin-space anisotropy of interaction. The results obtained within Mean Field Ap-

proximation (MFA) are also presented for comparison. The assumed interaction between hydrogen

adatoms is J(r) ∝ (1/r) exp (−r/λ), where the exponential attenuation reﬂects the presence of
disorder in the system. The results obtained for a wide range of impurity concentrations and

interaction decay length are discussed. The strongly non-linear behaviour of critical temperature

as a function of dilution is predicted, at variance with MFA predictions. Moreover, MFA tends

to overestimate heavily the critical temperature values compared to PA. An universal dependence

of critical temperature on impurity concentration and interaction decay length is found for strong

dilution regime.

INTRODUCTION

The search for novel magnetic materials is at the cutting edge of spintronic research. One

of the highly promising, yet still challenging platforms for spintronic devices is graphene and

various related systems1–7. In particular, hydrogenated graphene attracts both the theoret-

ical and experimental attention8–15. The natural goal to achieve is ﬁrst the introduction

of localized magnetic moments to graphene and secondly achieving the ferromagnetic or-

dering of the moments. Various paths towards ferromagnetic graphene systems have been

proposed16,17, to mention the proximity-induced magnetism18,19, magnetism of zigzag edge

states20–22, as well as creation of defects23–29 including formation of vacancies and deposition

of adatoms. One of the most fruitful approaches exploits the deposition of light adatoms on

graphene, to mention hydrogen30,31 and ﬂuorine32. The interactions between the chemisorbed

adatoms and the graphene cause a localized spin equal to 1/2 to emerge. Such a phenomenon

has been already demonstrated experimentally33,34 in a direct magnetometric experiment as

well as in indirect approaches, utilizing the spin transport measurements35,36.

Also the existence of long-range coupling between magnetic impurities in graphene-based

systems is predicted. For example,

indirect, charge-carrier mediated Ruderman-Kittel-

Kasuya-Yosida interaction has a long-range nature and has been extensively studied in

graphene (e.g.37–41). Its unique feature in graphene is the mutual relation between the cou-

pling sign and the bipartite nature of graphene lattice: namely, the impurities located over

the sites of the same sublattice should couple ferromagnetically38. The coupling was also

studied in numerous derivative systems, to mention for example bilayer graphene42,43 and

multilayer graphene44. Also a Density Functional Theory was employed to investigate the

magnetic interactions of various adatoms on graphene surface. Among the Density Func-

tional Theory-based studies of interspin coupling for particular kinds of magnetic moments

in graphene, let us notice for example the prediction of power law-like decay of coupling

between magnetic defects for periodically arranged hydrogenated vacancies in graphene45.

A similar behaviour was found in Ref. 46 for Co adatoms. Calculations for a wider group of

adsorbates47 also predict a power decay of ferromagnetic coupling for impurities in the same

sublattice. Finally, the work11 predicts the ferromagnetic coupling falling oﬀ as 1/r between

hydrogen adatoms on the surface of multilayer graphene (or graphite) if deposited in the

same sublattice. Such interaction for graphene was also found in Ref. 48. The example of

2

Ref. 11 will be of special interest to us.

A key prediction related to the properties of a diluted ferromagnetic material is its crit-

ical (Curie) temperature and its dependence on the concentration of magnetic impurities.

Making such a prediction requires the knowledge of the interaction between the spins as well

as construction of the thermodynamic description of the magnetic system. Apart from the

interest in the critical temperature of graphene-based magnet due to its applicational poten-

tial in spintronics, such systems are also interesting from the purely thermodynamic point of

view. The description of magnetic systems with long-range interactions is usually performed

on the grounds of Mean Field Approximation (MFA), which always predicts linear depen-

dence of critical temperature on concentration of magnetic component. In such context it is

noteworthy that some graphene-based systems have been a subject of calculations by Monte

Carlo method49–51. In particular a diluted antiferromagnet has been investigated49, revealing

the ﬁnite-temperature ordering despite noticeably fast decay of interaction with the distance

and low dimensionality. The critical temperature was also found to depend non-linearly on

the concentration of magnetic moments. On the other hand, the studies of strongly diluted

magnets with simulational methods require huge clusters to guarantee suﬃcient number of

spins in the simulated system when interspin distances are large. This feature makes the

simulations increasingly computationally demanding for decreasing concentration of mag-

netic moments. Therefore, studies employing more advanced methods than MFA, but of

analytic character are well motivated.

The aim of the paper is to present the theoretical study of the critical temperature

of diluted, hydrogenated graphene-based ferromagnet based on a method reaching beyond

MFA. The system of interest consists of multilayer graphene (or graphite) with localized

magnetic moments due to the presence of the hydrogen adatoms. The interaction between

the moments is a modiﬁed coupling predicted in Ref. 11. Let us emphasize that predictions

of Ref. 11 concern graphite or graphene with at least ﬁve monolayers; therefore, we consider

our system to be multilayer graphene of suﬃcient thickness.

In the further sections we

discuss in details the theoretical model of our system as well as we present extensively the

numerical results.

sublattice on graphite (multilayer graphene) surface. Only the topmost layer of C atoms is shown.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

Our system of interest is a system of spin-1/2 magnetic impurities distributed over a

two-dimensional hexagonal lattice sites in on-site positions. Because we are interested in

conditions when long-range ferromagnetic coupling between impurities can exist, we consider

the particular case when the magnetic impurities are located only over the atoms belonging

to one of two sublattices11. Therefore, the resulting underlying lattice for our diluted magnet

is a triangular one (as illustrated in Fig. 1 with dashed lines). The parameter a0 = 2.454
˚A11 is the distance between nearest neighbouring atoms in the same sublattice. We denote

the concentration of impurities (i.e. H atoms) per lattice site of this triangular lattice by p.

Therefore, the coverage of surface with the adatoms is equal to p/2. let us strongly emphasize

that we are interested only in the case when the hydrogen is deposited in a form of single,

isolated adatoms, which type of defect leads to the formation of spin equal to 1/2. On the

contrary, pairs or larger clusters tend to be non-magnetic or at least exhibit signiﬁcantly

reduced magnetic moment in relation to the number of H atoms. The probability of creation

of such clusters increases with increasing p, so that our main range of interest is the regime

of strong dilution, very far from the total hydrogenation, leading to formation of graphone.

We assume that there exists a long-range ferromagnetic interaction between impurity

spins.

It has been predicted in Ref. 11 by means of DFT calculations that the coupling

between two H adatoms in the same sublattice is inversely proportional to their distance,
that is J (r) ∝ 1/r. However, we put emphasis on the fact that the real system is disordered

4

and a large number of impurities is present, which fact inﬂuences the electronic wavefunc-

tions due to localization and may limit the range of interaction. Such a phenomenon is

known for example from the studies of indirect RKKY coupling in disordered systems52,

including the case of indirect coupling in graphene53,54. The conclusion can be drawn that

the disorder causes damping of amplitude of indirect interaction and also shifts the phase52.

The ﬁrst eﬀect appears to be of larger importance and can be often approximated by means

of introducing an exponential damping of the long-range interaction, i.e. the factor e−r/λ

(being an approximation, as pointed out in Ref. 52). Such a modiﬁcation of coupling was

used, for example, in calculations regarding the disordered diluted magnetic semiconductors

(e.g.55,56). Therefore, we assume that the long-range ferromagnetic interaction in our case

takes the form of

J (r) = J0

a0
r

exp (−r/λ) ,

(1)

where for further numerical calculations we take the value of J0/kB = 2.67· 103 K according
to Ref. 11. The parameter λ is an exponential damping characteristic length which we treat

as a free parameter. Let us comment here that it might be diﬃcult to predict the value of

λ and to observe its inﬂuence in calculations based on a pair of impurities. This might be

even more complex for λ exceeding signiﬁcantly the size of the supercell.

In a system of spins 1/2 with long-range ferromagnetic couplings, a presence of second-

order phase transition can be expected. For the purpose of calculations of its critical tem-

perature (Curie temperature) we apply the Pair Approximation method, which we have

generalized in our earlier work57 to diluted ferromagnetic systems with long-range interac-

tions. The method is superior to Mean-Field Approximation since it takes into account

quantum ﬂuctuations and is therefore capable of treating anisotropies in spin space (for

example it distinguishes between Ising and Heisenberg coupling cases). Moreover, let us

mention here that PA predicts the critical temperature proportional to p−n/d in a strongly
diluted d-dimensional system with interactions falling oﬀ like J (r) ∝ 1/rn. This result is in
accord with qualitatively exact scaling predictions, contrary to MFA which yields TC ∝ p
regardless of the distance dependence of interactions. Such a non-linear concentration de-

pendence of the critical temperature has been experimentally observed, for example, in

diluted magnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)N with long-range ferromagnetic superexchange

interactions58–61. For such systems, also Monte Carlo calculations were performed, predict-

ing the already mentioned kind of non-linear dependence58–61.

(2)

where J (rij) > 0 is the exchange integral of long-range ferromagnetic interactions between

impurities of mutual distance equal to rij, given by Eq. 1. The dilution is introduced by

the operators ξi which take the values of 1 when a magnetic adatom is present over the site

i and 0 otherwise. The parameter ∆ describes the coupling anisotropy in spin space and

can take arbitrary value ranging from 0 (Ising couling) to 1 (isotropic Heisenberg coupling).

As we have shown in the work Ref. 57, the equation for critical temperature of continuous

phase transition (Curie temperature) has the following form:

where βC = 1/ (kBTC) is the inverse of critical temperature and kB is Boltzmann constant.

The summation extends over all the coordination zones of the studied lattice, characterized

by radii rk and number of atoms (at the distance rk from the selected origin) equal to zk.

The equation can be also written as:

In order to predict the values of critical temperature for our system in question, we

have performed extensive numerical calculations based on solving Eq. 3 for a wide range

of concentrations p and interaction decay parameters λ. Various interaction anisotropies

∆ (ranging from Ising coupling to isotropic Heisenberg coupling) were included. Since the

magnetic coupling in the system is a long-range one, we have used an appropriate cut-oﬀ

rmax for the radius of the coordination zones over which the summation in Eq. 3 takes place.

We found that the results are convergent to the limit of inﬁnite interaction range when
rmax ≃ 15λ, which value we have used in the calculations. For the purpose of comparison,
also the MFA approach was used, yielding the results based on Eq. 5. In the present section,

the obtained numerical results will be discussed.

FIG. 2. Lines of constant critical temperature plotted against concentration of H adatoms and

interaction decay length. (a) the comparison of results yielded by MFA and by PA for Heisenberg

and Ising interactions for two critical temperatures: 1K and 300 K; (b) the results of PA for

Heisenberg interactions for four critical temperatures: 1K, 10 K, 100K and 300 K.

Let us commence the discussion from the prediction what values of concentration p and

interaction decay parameter λ are necessary to achieve particular values of critical temper-

ature. In order to compare the results yielded by MFA and PA (for Ising and Heisenberg

couplings) for a wide range of p and λ, we plot the lines of constant critical temperature

(critical isotherms) as a function of both mentioned variables. Such a plot is shown in

Fig. 2(a) for two values of critical temperature: 1 K and room temperature equal to 300

K, in double logarithmic scale. It is evident that for the case of the lower temperature, the

discrepancy between MFA and PA result is pronounced, reaching orders of magnitude, even
for the case of λ reaching 500 ˚A, where the diﬀerence is still signiﬁcant. In the scale of the

8

plot, the inﬂuence of interaction anisotropy in spin space, as captured by PA, is less pro-

nounced (note the double logarithmic scale). For the case of room temperature predictions,

both methods yield more coherent results, in particular for weak interaction damping (large

λ). However, at higher concentrations of H atoms and more localized charge carriers (which

two factors may be mutually correlated in disordered system) there is still an important

diﬀerence between MFA and PA.

For the case of Heisenberg coupling (which is expected in the absence of additional sources

of anisotropy), we present the predictions of PA for critical isotherms in Fig. 2(b) for wider

range of critical temperatures: 1 K, 10 K, 100 K and 300 K. The lowest temperature critical

isotherm shows almost linear shape, while at higher temperatures the isotherms develop more

convex character. The room temperature is reached at the concentration p approximately
equal to 3 · 10−4 for λ = 500 ˚A.

The most interesting results are connected with the form of the critical temperature

dependence on concentration of magnetic moments. It is worth recalling that MFA predicts

always a linear dependence, regardless of the spatial dependence of long-range coupling. The

critical temperature is plotted as a function of concentration p in Fig. 3 in double logarithmic

scale, due to signiﬁcant dynamics of the data. Two cases are distinguished: Fig. 3(a) is
prepared for λ = 10 ˚A, so relatively strongly damped coupling, while Fig. 3(b) assumes
much longer λ = 100 ˚A. For both cases a huge overestimation of the critical temperature

by MFA is notable unless the concentration is very high. The function TC(p) predicted by

PA is highly non-linear. Moreover, the method allows to take into account the interaction

anisotropy in spin space, what is reﬂected in the diﬀerence between the Ising and isotropic

Heisenberg coupling case. This diﬀerence tends to vanish (in the double logarithmic scale) at

suﬃciently high values of concentration p, which values decrease with decreasing interaction

decay length. For suﬃciently high concentration, both the results of PA and MFA tend

to overlap (especially for higher λ), reﬂecting the limiting case described by the formula 5.
However, the regime of linear dependency of TC on p is reached, even for λ = 100 ˚A, at

considerably high concentrations of hydrogen impurity. Therefore, the remarkable feature of

the physically interesting range of concentrations is the manifestly non-linear rise of critical

temperature with increasing p. The insets in Fig. 3 present the critical temperature as a

function of concentration in linear scale, covering the range of room temperatures. The

diﬀerences between MFA results and the outcome of PA for limiting cases of interaction

emphasizing the vicinity of the room temperature.

anisotropy are the most pronounced at low value of λ = 10 ˚A (inset in Fig. 3(a))). However,
even at λ = 100 ˚A still the diﬀerence remains notable (as seen in inset in Fig. 3(b)).

The direct dependence of the critical temperature on concentration of H for the case of

Heisenberg couplings is shown in Fig. 4. A wide range of interaction damping parameter
λ is covered, i.e. λ = 1, . . . , 1000 ˚A. It is evident that the dependence is non-linear at

lower concentrations and becomes linearized for higher ones. The linearity regime extends

towards lower concentrations when λ increases. The room critical temperature is promised

to be reached at the concentrations of a few times 10−4 at the weakest interaction damping,

can be a challenge due to the presence of various sorts of defects. This would include not

only the presence of hydrogen impurities themselves but also some non-magnetic defects or

The dependence of critical temperature on coupling decay parameter λ is shown in double

logarithmic scale in Fig. 5, for two impurity concentrations: p = 10−2 and p = 10−3. Again,

11

in can be concluded that the diﬀerence between MFA and PA results is signiﬁcant unless the

interaction damping is very weak (what situates the system in the range of validity of the

MFA formula 5. This range is reached for smaller λ values if the concentration of magnetic

impurities is larger, thus emphasizing the importance of non-MFA calculations for predicting

the critical temperature for strongly diluted systems. The critical temperature varies non-

linearly with λ for such case and gradually acquires linear behaviour if the damping becomes

weak enough.

FIG. 6. Dependence of critical temperature normalized to critical temperature for Heisenberg

interactions on interaction anisotropy parameter ∆. Two values of interaction decay length: 10

(left axis scale) and 100 ˚A (right axis scale) and two values of H atoms concentration: 0.005 and

0.010 are considered. Please note the left and right axis scale diﬀerence.

As mentioned, PA is able to reﬂect the eﬀect of spin space anisotropy on the critical

temperature, to which anisotropy MFA is insensitive. Therefore, it can be useful to take a

closer look at the relative importance of the anisotropy for the value of critical temperature

for various ranges of parameters. The measure of the anisotropy is the ratio ∆, taking

the extreme values of 0 for Ising coupling and 1 for isotropic Heisenberg coupling. The

relative critical temperature (related to its value at ∆ = 1, i.e.

for isotropic Heisenberg

coupling) is plotted as a function of ∆ in Fig. 6. The left vertical scale is valid for λ = 100
˚A, while the right one - for λ = 10 ˚A. In general, coupling anisotropy causes the critical

temperature to increase (for example, for ferromagnets with nearest-neighbour interactions

12

only, the critical temperature for Ising case is higher than for Heisenberg case). However, it

can be easily observed that the relative change in critical temperature is signiﬁcantly larger
for stronger damping of long-range coupling. For λ = 100 ˚A it reaches at best a few per
cent, while for λ = 10 ˚A it can be of the order of a hundred per cent. Therefore, it can

be emphasized that for weak interacting damping, which paves the way toward high critical

temperatures, the inﬂuence of coupling anisotropy in spin space would not be a signiﬁcant

factor leading to further increase of TC. This statement is further supported by the fact that

the relative change in critical temperature decreases with rising impurity concentration,

which is another route to maximizing the critical temperature. As a consequence, inducing

the coupling anisotropy in spin space would be an eﬀective way of increasing the Curie

temperature only in the range of parameters where the temperature would be itself low. In

the range of validity of Eq. 5, TC completely loses its sensitivity to coupling anisotropy and

the system exhibits mean-ﬁeld behaviour.

FIG. 7. Universal dependence of λTC on λ2p predicted by MFA and by PA for Heisenberg and for

Ising interactions, when the integration over lattice is used (see Eq. 8 for PA and Eq. 9 for MFA).

As it was mentioned in the previous section, it can be shown that the critical temperatures

fall onto an universal curve provided that the the parameters p and λ are within the validity

range of integral approximation Eq. 6.

In such a range, the universal function λTC =

f (λ2p) exists and its form depends only on the spin-space anisotropy parameter ∆. Such an

universal dependence is demonstrated in Fig. 7, for the limiting cases of Ising and Heisenberg

13

interactions, based on Eq. 8. Also the MFA dependence 9 is shown for comparison. Let us

note that, in general, the integral approximation is valid for low p (see also49,57).

IV. FINAL REMARKS

In the paper, we have presented the calculations of the critical temperature for ferro-

magnetic system consisting of multilayer graphene with hydrogen adatoms. We based the

predictions on Pair Approximation method, which is able to take into account spin-space

anisotropy of interactions, thus it us superior to commonly applied Mean Field Approxi-

mation. Moreover, the method is not a simulational one, what is of particular importance

for strong dilution regime with large distances between spins. We have used the interaction

between adatoms predicted by Ref. 11 modifying it by introducing the exponential damping.

The main parameters of our model are: the concentration of hydrogen adatoms per carbon

lattice site in single sublattice and the interaction decay length. The results of extensive

calculations of critical temperature as a function of these two parameters were presented

and discussed.

Our main result is the generally non-linear dependence of the critical temperature on the

impurity concentration. We have found that, in general, MFA tends to overestimate heav-

ily the critical temperature, unless the damping of interaction is rather weak. Analysis of

the inﬂuence of spin-space anisotropy on the critical temperature yields the conclusion that

transition from isotropic Heisenberg to anisotropic Ising interaction can very eﬀectively in-

crease the critical temperature only for quite short damping lengths (where the temperature

itself is rather low), but has very limited eﬀect in the range where the critical temperature

is already high.

In the range of low concentrations of hydrogen, we found an universal dependence of λTC

on λ2p basing on the replacement of summation over the lattice sites with the integration.

The form of the mentioned dependence is only inﬂuenced by the interaction anisotropy.

We have also constructed critical isotherms in the space of two parameters:

impurity

concentration and interaction decay length, for various values of critical temperature. We

believe that there results can be particularly useful for making predictions concerning the

requirements to achieve the desired critical temperatures.

Let us not that, in principle, the eﬀective decay length of indirect coupling λ and the

14

concentration of magnetic impurities p are not independent variables. On the contrary, the

presence of impurities promotes the localization of charge carriers, decreasing the localiza-

tion length (see for example the theoretical study in Ref. 62, where the localization length for

electronic wavefunctions was decreasing linearly with a logarithm of impurity concentration,

as shown in Fig. 5(b) in that reference). Such eﬀects might not be directly visible in any

DFT calculations of indirect magnetic exchange. It is motivated by the fact that in such

calculations only a pair of impurities is considered (with open or periodic boundary condi-

tions, the latter leading to periodic repetition of the pair). In a real, multi-impurity system

the distance dependence of the coupling might, therefore, diﬀer from the two-impurity pre-

diction. Therefore, it can be particularly challenging to achieve at the same time rather high

concentration of impurities and weak damping of interaction.

The damping parameter which we use is a kind of phenomenological parameter. In the

case of RKKY interaction damping in systems such as diluted magnetic semiconductors, this

quantity could be identiﬁed with mean free path of the charge carriers63,64. However, for the

system considered here, the interpretation of this parameter could be more sophisticated and

less direct. The reason for introducing it is the necessity of including the eﬀect of disorder

on indirect interactions.

It should be also mentioned that the ferromagnetic ordering of adatoms deposited over the

sites of the same sublattice due to ferromagnetic couplings should decrease the total energy at

the same time preferring such distribution of impurities in comparison with their deposition

over both sublattices65. Also other factors may contribute to that eﬀect66, stabilizing the

system in the state with the impurities occupying just one sublattice. On the other hand,

this means that the distribution of adatoms is not of purely random character and their

positions can exhibit some correlations. The presence of such correlations would inﬂuence

the thermodynamic description of the system (as demonstrated, for example, for the case of

diluted magnets with RKKY interaction56 or with interaction between nearest neighbours67).

An important question regarding the stability of the considered system can also be the

issue of mobility of the adatoms on the surface. However, a suppression of hopping of

impurities can be expected according Ref. 68, what suggests the decent stability of the

system.

Such factors as correlated distribution of hydrogen impurities or growing tendency for

charge carriers localization with the increase of impurity concentration are certainly worth

15

incorporating into the detailed theory of magnetism in hydrogenated graphene systems.

Therefore, we believe that our calculations can serve as a useful starting point for further

developments in this ﬁeld, aimed at achieving robust carbon-based ferromagnetic materials.
