Chaotic Bohmian trajectories for stationary states

Alexandre Cesa∗, John Martin†, and Ward Struyve‡

March 7, 2016

Abstract

We study the possibility of chaos for the Bohmian dynamics when the wave func-
tion is stationary. Examples of stationary wave functions are given for which there
is chaos, as demonstrated by numerical computations, for one particle moving in
3 spatial dimensions and for two and three entangled particles in 2 dimensions.
Among other things, this illustrates that moving nodes of a wave function are not
necessary to have chaos. What is important for the amount of chaos is the over-
all complexity of the wave function. Some simple measures that partly capture
the complexity of the wave function are considered: the participation ratio and
diﬀerent measures of entanglement. We ﬁnd that these measures often tend to
correlate to the amount of chaos. However, the correlation is not perfect, because
the measures do not depend on the intrinsic complexity of the states of a given
basis.

Introduction

Bohmian mechanics is an alternative to standard quantum mechanics which describes
actual point-particles moving under the inﬂuence of the wave function [1–4]. Denoting
the particle positions by xk, k = 1, . . . , n, and the conﬁguration by x = (x1, . . . , xn),
the dynamics is given by the guidance equation

with ψ = |ψ|eiS and mk the mass of the k-th particle. The wave function ψ satisﬁes the
usual Schr¨odinger equation. This theory reproduces the predictions of standard quantum
theory provided that for an ensemble of systems all with the same wave function, the
particle conﬁguration is distributed according to |ψ(x, 0)|2. For this will indeed be the
case for typical initial conﬁgurations of the universe [3, 4].

In this paper, we study the possibility of chaos for the Bohmian dynamics for sta-
tionary wave functions, i.e., wave functions of the form ψ(x, t) = e−iEtφ(x). We give
examples of such wave functions for which numerical simulations show that the Bohmian
dynamics is chaotic (as quantiﬁed by the maximal Lyapunov exponent) for one particle
moving in 3 spatial dimensions in section 4, and for two and three entangled particles
in 2-d respectively in sections 5 and 6.

Stationary states were considered before in a number of papers [5–7]. In [5, 6], only
4-d systems were considered (corresponding to two particles in 2-d).
It was namely
argued that chaos was not possible for a stationary state in 3-d [5]. However, as we
will explain in section 2, the argument is not correct. This will also be illustrated by
the examples in section 4. Since a stationary state leads to an autonomous Bohmian
dynamics, the Poincar´e-Bendixson theorem1 implies that the lowest possible dimension
for which chaos is possible for a stationary state is three [5] (cf. section 2).
In [7],
it was claimed that a particular stationary state for a particle in 3-d yields chaos in
certain regions of conﬁguration space. However, as we explain in section 2, this claim is
unfounded as in this case, there are constants of motion which make the motion regular.
Another motivation for our work comes from the work of Wisniacki and Pujals [8],
who investigated the role of the motion of the nodes (points where the wave function
vanishes) on the possibility of chaotic Bohmian dynamics. 2-d systems were considered
and it was argued that chaos appears in the vicinity of moving nodes and that there is
regular motion in the vicinity of stationary nodes. It was believed that these results are
also valid for higher dimensions. This seems to be true generically. However, as we show
in this paper, there are also counter-examples. In section 3, we give examples of (non-
stationary) wave functions in 2 and 3-d which may have an arbitrary number of moving
nodes, but which do not give rise to chaotic motion. Conversely, in sections 4, 5 and 6
we provide examples of stationary states which yield chaos. Stationary states are the
simplest examples of states with stationary nodes (since the density |ψ|2 is stationary
the nodes must be stationary as well). For stationary states we need to consider at least
3-d in order to ﬁnd chaos. However, it might be possible to have a non-stationary state
with one or more stationary nodes. It would be interesting to see if such states allow for
chaotic motion. We have found no example of such a wave function. For this question,
we considered the Coulomb potential for which the excited energy eigenstates all have a
node at the origin. However, we were unable to ﬁnd a superposition of such states that
has no other nodes.

So the presence of (moving) nodes alone is not suﬃcient to guarantee chaos. For
2-d systems, it was shown that the presence of a so-called X-point near the node gives

1The Poincar´e-Bendixson theorem states that if a trajectory is conﬁned to a closed, bounded region

of the plane, with no ﬁxed points, then it must approach a closed orbit, hence it cannot be chaotic.

rise to chaos [9, 10]. Another result is that the amount of chaos tends to increase with
the number of nodes [7, 11]. Generally speaking, what is important for having chaos is
an overall complexity of the wave function [12]. We explore some simple measures that
partly capture the complexity of the wave function. In sections 5 and 6, we respectively
compare the amount of chaos with the participation ratio, which measures how much a
states is “delocalized” in a given basis, i.e., from how much basis states the state is made
up, and entanglement measures such as the Meyer-Wallach and the geometric measure.
(Some of these measures have also been considered in the context of quantum chaos [13],
which concerns a way to characterize chaos for quantum systems diﬀerent from the
one considered here which is in terms of the Bohmian dynamics.) We ﬁnd that these
measures often tend to relate to the amount of chaos. However, there are shortcomings
of these measures. For starters, none of them captures the intrinsic complexity of the
basis states. In addition, the participation ratio does not depend on the relative phases
that appear in the coeﬃcients of the expansion terms in that basis.

2 General considerations
For simplicity we put the masses and charges of the particles as well as  equal to one.

2.1 Stationary states

If the spectrum is non-degenerate then the energy eigenstates can be chosen real and
the Bohmian particles do not move. So in order to allow for chaos we need to consider
a degenerate spectrum. We will consider stationary superpositions of the form

ψ(x, t) = e−iEtφ(x) = e−iEt(cid:88)

φi(x),

(3)

i

where the energy eigenstates φi are eigenstates of a complete set of commuting observ-
ables so that they constitute an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space.
We will consider two types of states φi. The ﬁrst type is of the form

φ(x) = f (x)g(y)h(z),

(4)

with x = (x, y, z) and f , g and h real functions. Such states will be considered for
the 3d harmonic oscillator (φ3d
nx,ny,nz ). We will also consider systems in 2-d such as the
particle in a 2d-box (φbox
nx,ny ) and the 2d harmonic oscillator (φ2d
nx,ny ). In that case the
z-coordinate should be dropped. The second type is of the form

φ(x) = f (r)g(θ)eimϕ,

(5)

where (r, θ, ϕ) are spherical coordinates, with θ the polar angle and ϕ the azimuthal
angle, and f and g real. These states are eigenstates of the angular momentum operator

(cid:98)Lz = −i∂φ with eigenvalue m. Such states will be considered for the 3d harmonic

2.2 Constants of motion

For chaotic motion to be possible, the number of dimensions needs to be at least 3. This
follows from the Poincar´e-Bendixson theorem [14]. For a non-stationary dynamics this
number needs to be at least 2 (since such a dynamics is equivalent to a stationary one
by introducing an independent variable τ , treating time as a dependent variable t(τ )
and introducing the equation of motion dt/dτ = 1). For a stationary wave function
the velocity ﬁeld is stationary too. Hence for such a state we need at least 3 spatial
dimensions for chaos to be possible.

Constants of motion reduce the eﬀective number of degrees of freedom. For example,
for states of the form (5), the phase does not depend on r and θ and hence the guidance
equation (6) implies that r and θ are constant. The only eﬀective degree of freedom is
ϕ. The possible trajectories are circles [2] and there is no chaos.

There are a couple of types of constant of motion that we will encounter. The ﬁrst

type arises for a superposition of the form

ψ(x1, . . . , xn, t) = f1(x1)g1(x2)χ1(x3, . . . , xn, t) + f2(x1)g2(x2)χ2(x3, . . . , xn, t),

(7)

with x1, . . . , xn Cartesian coordinates, and where fi and gi, i = 1, 2, are real. For such
a wave function, the guidance equations for x1 and x2 are of the form

with dF (x1)/dx1 = f (x1) and dG(x2)/dx2 = g(x2).

nx,ny,nz + iφbox

In [7], two energy eigenstates of the form φbox

ny,nz,nx where considered for
a particle in a square box. It was claimed that for (nx, ny, nz) = (3, 2, 1), the dynamics
was regular, while for (nx, ny, nz) = (103, 102, 101), the dynamics was chaotic in certain
regions. However, there are two independent constants of motion of the form (11)
which depend on diﬀerent pairs of coordinates, so that there is only one eﬀective degree
of freedom and there cannot be chaos, regardless of the choice of quantum numbers
(nx, ny, nz).

For spherical coordinates, we can have similar constants of motion (examples are

found in [15]). For example, consider a superposition of the form

ψ(r1, θ1, ϕ1, . . . , rn, θn, ϕn, t) = f1(r1)g1(θ1)χ1(ϕ1, . . . , t) + f2(r1)g2(θ2)χ1(ϕ1, . . . , t),

(12)
where fi and gi are real, i = 1, 2. The guidance equations for r1 and θ1 are of the form

= (f1∂r1f2 − f2∂r1f1)g1g2

In this case, there is the constant of motion

C(r1, θ1) = F (r1) − G(θ1),

with dF (r1)/dr1 = f (r1) and dG(θ1)/dθ1 = g(θ1), and

Finally, consider a superposition of the form

ψ(x1, . . . , xn, t) = f1(x1)f2(x2)f2(x3)χ1(x4, . . . , xn, t)

+ f2(x1)f1(x2)f2(x3)χ2(x4, . . . , xn, t) + f2(x1)f2(x2)f1(x3)χ3(x4, . . . , xn, t),

(16)

with x1, . . . , xn Cartesian coordinates, and where f1 and f2, are real. One can show
similarly as above that there is the constant of motion

(15)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

C(x1, x2, x3) = F (x1) + F (x2) + F (x3),

with dF (x)/dx = f (x) and

f =

f1∂xf2 − f2∂xf1

.

It is often reported that for a stationary state, the energy of the Bohmian particles

(cid:88)

|vψ

E(x, t) =

+ V (x) + Q(x, t)

is a constant of motion, see e.g. [5, 6]. The quantity V is the usual potential energy and
k|ψ|/2|ψ|. It appears as an extra

which follows from taking the time derivative of the guidance equation. Along a tra-
jectory, we have that dE/dt = ∂Q/∂t, so that E is generically not conserved. For a
stationary state ψ(x, t) = e−iEtφ(x) it is conserved, since |ψ| and hence Q are time-
independent. However, we also have that E takes the same value for all possible trajec-
tories, namely E = E. Hence this is a trivial constant of motion and it does not reduce
the eﬀective number of degrees of freedom. Therefore the Poincar´e-Bendixson theorem
does not exclude the possibility of chaos. In section 4, we will provide some examples
of stationary states in 3-d that lead to chaos.

2.3 Quantifying chaos

Many tools have been developed in order to probe and quantify chaos of a dynamical
system [16]. Here, we explain the methods used in this paper. Chaos means that the
trajectories are highly sensitive to the initial position [14]. More precisely, there will
be chaos if trajectories exponentially diverge within small times. That is, if for initial
positions x0 and ˜x0, initially separated by a small distance d0, we have
h(x0, ˜x0)t (cid:28) 1,

|d(t)| ≡ |x(t) − ˜x(t)| = d0eh(x0,˜x0)t,

(21)

with h(x0, ˜x0) > 0.

The amount of chaos is quantiﬁed by the Lyapunov exponents [14], given by

(cid:18)

(cid:18)|d(t)|

(cid:19)(cid:19)

h(x0, e0) = lim
t→∞

lim
d0→0

1
t

ln

d0

,

(22)

where d0 is the initial distance between two trajectories starting at x(t0) = x0 and
˜x(t0) = x0 + d0e0 with e0 a unit vector and |d(t)| is the distance between these two
positions as a function of time. While this quantity depends on e0, it can attain at
most three diﬀerent values (which corresponds to the number of dimensions of the
conﬁguration space).
It can be shown that for almost all directions, i.e. almost all
e0, the maximal value is obtained [14].

In order to numerically compute the Lyapunov exponent, we use the procedure [14,
17] illustrated in ﬁgure 1. Starting from two initial positions x0 and ˜x0 at time t0
separated by a distance d0, we numerically integrate the trajectories up to some time
t0 + ∆t to obtain d(t0 + ∆t) = ˜x(t0 + ∆t) − x(t0 + ∆t). Then we repeat the procedure
with initial positions x(t0 + ∆t) and x(t0 + ∆t) + d0e(t0 + ∆t), where e(t0 + ∆t) is the
unit vector in the direction of d(t0 + ∆t). So the separation between these positions is
rescaled to d0 every ∆t. We repeat this N times. For large total time T = N ∆t, the
maximal Lyapunov exponent is then in good approximation given by

N(cid:88)

k=1

ln

(cid:18)|d(t0 + k∆t)|

(cid:19)

d0

h(x0, T ) ≈ 1
T

.

(23)

A positive value of h(x0) indicates that the dynamics is (strongly) chaotic, while h(x0) ≤
0 indicates that the trajectories stay close together in the sense that they do not diverge
exponentially.

6

Figure 1: In order to numerically compute the Lyapunov exponent, the distance between
two initially close trajectories is rescaled every ∆t.

We benchmarked this method of computation of the Lyapunov exponent by com-
puting h(x0) for the H´enon-Heiles Hamiltonian, as was also done in [17]. We also
computed the Lyapunov exponent of Bohmian trajectories for the systems studied in
references [8, 11]. In both cases, our results were in good agreement.

The Lyapunov exponent deﬁned in (22) quantiﬁes the amount of chaos for particular
trajectories. In order to probe the amount of chaos for an ensemble of trajectories all
with the same wave function, one has to sample the initial position in conﬁguration
space and, for every point, compute the Lyapunov exponent. Then one can either plot a
map of these exponents or compute the average over the conﬁguration space. The former
method may distinguish regions in conﬁguration space that lead to chaotic motion and
regions that do not. However, for simplicity we will just present averages here.

While the discussion was so far restricted to a 3-dimensional system, it straightfor-
wardly generalizes to a many-particle system whose conﬁguration space is n-dimensional.
There is another way to qualitatively probe the chaotic behavior of a dynamical sys-
tem which consists in computing a Poincar´e section, also called a section of surface [14].
The Poincar´e section is obtained by considering the points of intersection of an n-d
trajectory x(t) with a hyperplane of dimension n − 1. Regions in the Poincar´e section
that display a regular pattern of points indicate a regular part of the trajectory. Regions
where the points are densely and randomly distributed, indicate a chaotic part of the
trajectory.

3 States with moving nodes and no chaos

As we will show in the next section, one can have wave functions with stationary nodes
that give rise to chaotic Bohmian trajectories. Conversely, having (arbitrarily many)
moving nodes is no guarantee for chaos, as we will illustrate here with some examples.
A more complex mechanism is required, as for example discussed in [9, 10] for two
dimensional systems.

In one spatial dimension, a non-stationary state will generically have moving nodes,

but the Bohmian motion will not be chaotic due to the Poincar´e-Bendixon theorem.

For two or three dimensions, consider the superposition of two stationary states of

7

the form

ψ(x, t) = c1e−iE1tφ1(x) + c2e−iE2tφ2(x),

(24)

where the ci, i = 1, 2, are complex numbers and where the φi are of the form (4), i.e.
a real function that is separable in the Cartesian coordinates. Such states generically
have moving nodes (considering states φi with diﬀerent energies). However, there are
two constants of motion of the type (11) in the case of three dimensions and one in
the case of two dimensions. These constants of motion reduce the eﬀective number of
degrees of freedom so that, again as a consequence of the Poincar´e-Bendixon theorem,
the Bohmian motion can not be chaotic.

For the ﬁnal example, consider again superpositions of the form (24), but now with
the φi of the form (5), i.e., φi(r, θ, ϕ) = fi(r, θ)eimiϕ, with the fi real. The number of
nodes of the functions fi grows with the energy. As such, we could construct states
with an arbitrary number of moving nodes. These nodes move in circles around the
z-axis with a constant angular velocity. This is because the state becomes stationary in
a rotating frame, with angular frequency

ω =

E1 − E2
m2 − m1

.

Namely, if we introduce the variable ϕ(cid:48) = ϕ + ωt, then the state (24) reads

ψ(r, θ, ϕ) = ψ(cid:48)(r, θ, ϕ(cid:48), t) = e−i(E1+m1ω)t+im1ϕ(cid:48)(cid:16)

c1f1(r, θ) + c2f2(r, θ)eiϕ(cid:48)(m2−m1)(cid:17)

(25)

.

(26)

So in the rotating frame the state is stationary and the Bohmian motion reduces to the
autonomous dynamics

where S(cid:48) is the phase of ψ(cid:48). In two dimensions this implies that the Bohmian motion can
not be chaotic because of the Poincar´e-Bendixon theorem (as was noted before in [12]).
The same conclusion holds for three dimensions since in this case there is also a constant
of motion of the form (14) for r and θ.

4 Single particle in 3-d

tionary superpositions ψ = e−iEtφ = e−iEt(cid:80)

We have already mentioned that for a stationary state in 2-d, the motion can not be
chaotic. Therefore we need to consider at least three dimensions. We will consider sta-
i φi of three and four orthogonal degenerate
energy eigenstates φi of the form (4) or (5). As shown in the previous section, there is
no chaos for superpositions of only two such states.

4.1 Superposition of three eigenstates: examples of chaotic

motion

For the harmonic oscillator we can consider the complete set of energy eigenstates
nx,ny,nz (x, y, z), cf. (65), or φsph
φ3d
k,l,m(r, θ, ϕ), cf. (67). These states are respectively of
the form (4) and (5). For each choice, we will consider a superposition of three states
that gives rise to chaotic Bohmian motion.

As a ﬁrst example, consider the superposition
0,3,1(r, θ, ϕ) + eiπ/3φsph

φsph(r, θ, ϕ) = φsph

0,3,0(r, θ, ϕ) + eiπ/7φsph

1,1,0(r, θ, ϕ)

(28)

with energy 9/2. This state has nodal lines, which are however diﬃcult to ﬁnd ana-
lytically. Figure 2 illustrates a typical Bohmian trajectory for this wave function. The

position (r, θ, ϕ) = (6.6969, 2.38696,−0.249865). (b) Poincar´e section in the plane z = 0.

trajectory starting outside the bulk of the wave packet moves towards it and eventually
move inside it. The Poincar´e section in the plane z = 0 shown on the middle panel of
ﬁgure 2 indicates that the dynamics is not regular. This is conﬁrmed by the Lyapunov
exponent h ≈ 0.06 (see the right panel of ﬁgure 2).

As a second example, consider now the stationary state

φ3d(x, y, z) = φ3d

1,1,1(x, y, z) + eiπ/3φ3d

3,0,0(x, y, z) + eiπ/7φ3d

1,2,0(x, y, z),

(29)

which also has energy 9/2. In this case there is a nodal plane at x = 0. In the limit of x
going to zero, the velocity does not blow up but rather becomes tangential to the plane
x = 0. The Bohmian trajectories do not cross this plane, they tend to be repelled by it.
The other nodal lines are given by

0.06, this becomes visible to the naked eye only at around t = 300.

These nodal lines end in the plane x = 0. A typical Bohmian trajectory for this system is
illustrated in ﬁgure 3. The trajectory ﬁrst spirals around a nodal line. When the particles
arrive at the end of the nodal line, the trajectories continue freely until it reaches the
vacinity of another nodal line. Such behavior has been reported before [7, 18]. Most of
the Poincar´e section in the plane z = 0 is composed of regions where the points look
randomly distributed which constitutes a strong clue that the motion is chaotic. This is
conﬁrmed by the calculated Lyapunov exponent which is again approximately equal to
0.06. The right panel of ﬁgure 3 illustrates the exponential divergence of two initially
close trajectories.

4.2 Superposition of four eigenstates: relating chaos to the

complexity of the wave function

We have shown that the Bohmian trajectories of 3-d systems with stationary states may
be chaotic. We now study the eﬀect of the particular form of the wave function on the
amount of chaos. We will consider the harmonic oscillator and stationary wave functions
of the form

where ci(α, β) = |ci(α)|eiχi(β), so the amplitude and the phase of the coeﬃcients ci are
(cid:80)
functions of respectively α and β. The quantum numbers ki, li, mi are chosen such
that φ(x; α, β) is a stationary state. We also assume the states to be normalized (i.e.,
i |ci|2 = 1). While this does not aﬀect the Bohmian velocity ﬁeld, it will be important
when considering a measure of complexity of the wave function. In order to quantify the
amount of chaos, we compute the average Lyapunov exponent ¯h over 150 diﬀerent initial

The trajectories used in the determination of the Lyapunov exponent were computed
from t = 0 to t = 5 · 104.

states is 13/2.

(33)

Figure 4(a) shows the average Lyapunov exponent as a function of α. For α = 0 and
α = π/2, φ(x; α, 0) is a superposition of only two eigenstates and thus the Bohmian
trajectories are regular, cf. section 3. This agrees with the calculated value of ¯h which
is zero. ¯h is maximum around α = π/10 and then decreases as α increases.

In order to investigate the eﬀect of the choice of eigenstates in φ(x; α, β) on the
chaotic behavior of the Bohmian trajectories, we also compute the average Lyapunov
exponent for the stationary state
φ(cid:48)(x; α, 0) = N (α)[cos(α)φsph

2,3,2(x) + eiπ/3 sin(α)φsph

(34)

which have energy 17/2. This state diﬀers from φ(x; α, 0) only in the quantum numbers
of the four eigenstates in terms of which it is constructed. Figure 4(b) shows the average
Lyapunov exponent for some values of α. Just as before, for α = 0 and α = π/2, ¯h
should vanish. For φ(cid:48)(x; α, 0), ¯h reaches the maximal value approximately equal to 0.2
near α = π/4.

Although the states φ(x; α, 0) and φ(cid:48)(x; α, 0) have the same coeﬃcients in their de-
composition in the basis of eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator, the evolution of the
average Lyapunov exponent is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. For both wave functions, ¯h takes
a maximum value of around 0.2 but for a diﬀerent value of α. So, in particular, a
small increase of the energy of the wave function does not necessarily lead to a greater
amount of chaos in the Bohmian trajectories. For instance, one can see by comparing
ﬁgures 4(a) and 4(b) that for α = π/10, ¯h is more than twice as high for φ(x; α) as for
φ(cid:48)(x; α, 0), even though the energy of the latter wave function is higher. When α = π/4
this situation is reversed.

In order to bring to light the eﬀect of the choice of phases of the coeﬃcients, we
consider the states φ(x; π/4, β), where the amplitudes of the coeﬃcients are ﬁxed and
the phases may vary. Figure 4(c) illustrates the average Lyapunov exponent for some

Figure 4: (a) and (b) Average Lyapunov exponent ¯h as a function of α for Bohmian
trajectories for respectively the states φ(x; α, 0) of energy 13/2 and φ(cid:48)(x; α, 0) of energy
17/2. The average ¯h is performed over 150 initial positions. The error bars correspond
to the standard deviation of the Lyapunov exponent over diﬀerent trajectories. (c) ¯h as

values of the parameter β. The average Lyapunov exponent takes values between 0.07
and 0.16. Thus, ¯h is quite sensitive to the choice of the relative phase of the coeﬃcients.
The dependence on β also looks rather complicated.

These results clearly show that the amount of chaos is connected to the overall
complexity of the wave function. It would be interesting to capture this complexity by a
simple measure. A possible measure is given by the participation ratio (PR) [19]. Given
i=1 ciφi in an orthonormal basis φi, i = 1, . . . , N , the PR is given

a decomposition ψ =(cid:80)N

by

PR(ψ) =

It quantiﬁes the number of basis states on which the state ψ is delocalized. The PR is
equal to 1 when ψ is a basis element φi and takes the maximum value N when ψ is an

basis states tends to correlate with the amount of chaos. However, this measure has two
shortcomings: it does not take into account the intrinsic complexity of the basis states
and the relative phases of the terms in the superposition.

Since the PR does not depend on the intrinsic complexity of the basis states, it
takes the same value for the wave functions φ(x; α, 0) and φ(cid:48)(x; α, 0) (cf. 32 and 34).
Figure 4(d) shows the PR for these states as a function of α. The PR shows a good
qualitative agreement with the average Lyapunov exponent ¯h for the wave function
φ(cid:48)(x; α, 0), but a bit less so for φ(x; α, 0). For both φ(x; α, 0) and φ(cid:48)(x; α, 0), the PR
reaches a minimum for α = 0 and α = π/2, just as ¯h (whose theoretical value is zero).
The PR has a maximum at α = π/4 as does the average Lyapunov exponent for the
wave function φ(cid:48)(x; α, 0). However, for the wave function φ(x; α, 0) the maxima of ¯h
and PR do not coincide. And while the PR is symmetric around α = π/4, like ¯h for
φ(cid:48)(x; α, 0), ¯h for φ(x; α, 0) is not.

The second shortcoming of the PR for indicating the amount of chaos is that it
does not depend on the phases of the coeﬃcients ci. As we have seen, with the wave
functions φ(x; π/4, β), the amount of chaos strongly depends on the value of the phases,
cf. ﬁgure 4(c).

Therefore, in order to characterize the amount of chaos in Bohmian trajectories, a
simple measure of superposition such as the PR is not enough. One needs to take into
account the intrinsic complexity of the eigenstates that appear in the superposition as
well as their relative phases. Nevertheless, generically, the PR gives the general trend
of the value of the Lyapunov exponent.

5 Two-particle systems

In this section we study the Bohmian trajectories of systems of two particles whose
wave functions are stationary entangled states. We focus our attention on 2-d systems.
Our interest lies of course with entangled states, since for such states the motion of one
particle depends on the position of the other particle, unlike for a separable state. We
give three examples of wave functions for which there is chaotic motion.

5.1 Superpositions with 2 single-particle basis states

Using two single-particle basis states φ1 and φ2, the most general two-particle state
reads

φ2p
2 (x1, x2) = c1φ1(x1)φ1(x2) + c2φ1(x1)φ2(x2) + c3φ2(x1)φ1(x2) + c4φ2(x1)φ2(x2) (36)

where the superscript denotes the number of particles and the subscript the number
of single-particle basis states involved in the superposition. For states φi(x, y) of the
form (4) there are two constants of motion of the form (11) (even for a non-stationary

possible.

Consider states of the form (36), but now with the φi(r, ϕ) of the form (5)). Unlike
the case where they are of the form (4), such states generically do not seem to yield
constants of motion, so that chaotic motion may be possible. As an example, consider
the harmonic oscillator with single-particle energy eigenstates φpol
(r, ϕ), cf. (61), and
the wave function

Figure 5 illustrates a typical set of trajectories for this system. The Lyapunov exponent
takes a value h ≈ 0.17, which indicates chaos.

5.2 Superpositions with 3 single-particle basis states

As we have seen in the previous section, stationary superpositions of only two single-
particle basis states φi(x, y) of the form (4) cannot give rise to chaos. For superpositions

2This follows from the fact that one can write φ2p
2

in two diﬀerent ways in the form (7), namely

φ2p
2 (x1, x2) = φ1(x1) (c1φ1(x2) + c2φ2(x2)) + φ2(x1) (c3φ1(x2) + c4φ2(x2))

and

φ2p
2 (x1, x2) = φ1(x2) (c1φ1(x1) + c3φ2(x1)) + φ2(x2) (c2φ1(x1) + c4φ2(x1)) .

(37)

(38)

Since the φi(x, y) are of the form (4), there are two constants of motion of the form (11) for (x1, y1)
and (x2, y2).

typical Bohmian trajectories for this system. We obtain the rather large value of around
25 for the Lyapunov exponent. This example also illustrates the non-local character of
Bohmian mechanics. Although the particles are always in diﬀerent regions of the box,
their trajectories strongly inﬂuence each other which allows chaotic motion (remember
that for a 2-d system with stationary wave function, the Bohmian trajectories are always
regular). Actually, the amount of chaos would not change if we moved one particle in a
box arbitrarily far away.

In this section, we consider 3-particle systems in 2-d and investigate the amount of chaos
for diﬀerent entangled states.

6.1 Superpositions with 2 single-particle basis states

First we consider superpositions formed using two diﬀerent single-particle states φi.
These states can be seen as three-qubit states. We focus our attention on the states

φ3p
GHZ(x1, x2, x3) = c1φ1(x1)φ1(x2)φ1(x3) + c2φ2(x1)φ2(x2)φ2(x3),

(43)

φ3p
W(x1, x2, x3) = c1φ1(x1)φ2(x2)φ2(x3) + c2φ2(x1)φ1(x2)φ2(x3) + c3φ2(x1)φ2(x2)φ1(x3),
(44)
which belong respectively to the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and the W entan-
glement classes [20].

GHZ. The states φ3p

For states φi(x, y) of the form (4), there are 5 independent constants of motion of
the form (11), for φ3p
W lead to 3 constants of motion of the form (11)
for (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3), and 2 of the form (17) for (x1, x2, x3) and (y1, y2, y3).
In both cases, the constants of motion make that there is no chaos, despite the entan-
glement. This remains true even if the states are non-stationary (and thus have moving
nodes).

For states φi(r, ϕ) of the form (5), the state φ3p

GHZ gives two independent constants
of motion of the form (11) for (r1, r2) and (r2, r3). If we introduce the variable ϕ =
ϕ1 + ϕ2 + ϕ3, then the wave function depends on this variable and r1, r2 and r3. So
in terms of the variables ϕ, ϕ2, ϕ3, r1, r2, r3, the Bohmian dynamics for ϕ, r1, r2, r3 is
independent of ϕ2 and ϕ3. The two constants of motion imply that the dynamics
for ϕ, r1, r2, r3 is regular. Furthermore, the dynamics of ϕ2 and ϕ3 only depends on
ϕ, r1, r2, r3, and therefore there is no chaos.

For states φi(r, ϕ) of the form (5), the state φ3p

W leads to one constant of motion of the
type (17) for (r1, r2, r3) and trajectories can be chaotic. Indeed, consider the harmonic
oscillator and the state

(45)

The Lyapunov exponent is approximately equal to 0.12, which indicates chaos. A par-
ticular set of trajectories is shown in ﬁgure 7.

6.2 Superpositions with 3 single-particle basis states

In the previous section we have seen that the states (43) and (44) do not lead to chaos
for states using two states φi(x, y) of the form (4). Chaos is possible for states that are
formed using three such states. More precisely, we consider the states

φ3p
3 (x1, x2, x3) = c1φ1(x1)φ1(x2)φ1(x3) + c2φ2(x1)φ2(x2)φ2(x3) + c3φ3(x1)φ3(x2)φ3(x3).

which has the same coeﬃcients as the state (47). A typical set of Bohmian trajectories
is shown in ﬁgure 8(b). Just as in the two-particle case, the particles move in diﬀerent
quadrants of the box. The Lyapunov exponent is approximately 25, so that there is
chaos.

6.3 Entanglement and chaos

In this section we explore the relation between chaos and the complexity of the wave
function as measured by the amount of entanglement. There are many measures of
multipartite entanglement. Here, we consider three of them: the Meyer-Wallach measure
(Q), the geometric measure (EG) and the three-tangle (τ3). The Meyer-Wallach measure
of entanglement Q(ψ) ∈ [0, 1] is deﬁned by [21]

entropies 2(1−tr(cid:98)ρ2

where the maximum is taken over all possible separable (i.e. non-entangled) states. It

It can be interpreted as the amount of entanglement between one qubit and the re-
maining two qubits not accounted for by the amount of entanglement between pairs of
qubits.

−4−2024−4−2024yx(a)00.20.40.60.8100.20.40.60.81yx(a)(b)These entanglement measures vanish if the state ψ is separable. In that case, the
motion of the Bohmian particles is uncorrelated and hence not chaotic. Conversely,
when the measure vanishes this implies that the state ψ is separable in the case of the
ﬁrst two measures, but not in the case of the three-tangle.
These measures will not be able to fully capture the complexity of the wave func-
tion, as they do not depend on the choice of the basis states |0(cid:105) and |1(cid:105) (just like the
participation ratio). That is, they will not capture the intrinsic complexity of the basis
states. As we have already seen before, this intrinsic complexity plays an important role
in the amount of chaos. In addition, note that entanglement is not suﬃcient to imply
chaos. As a simple example, consider real wave functions. The wave function can be
arbitrarily much entangled, but the Bohmian conﬁguration is static, so that there is no
chaos.
In the following, we will consider stationary states belonging to the W entanglement
class, i.e. states that are related by an invertible local operation to the W state |W(cid:105) =
√
(|001(cid:105) + |010(cid:105) + |100(cid:105))/
3. These states can be parametrized as follows
√
|W(a, b, c)(cid:105) =
a|001(cid:105) +

c|100(cid:105) +(cid:112)1 − (a + b + c)|000(cid:105),

(53)
where a, b, c ≥ 0, a + b + c ≤ 1, and |0(cid:105) and |1(cid:105) are single-particle basis states [20]. We
will take (cid:104)x|0(cid:105) and (cid:104)x|1(cid:105) to be the eigenstates φpol
(r, ϕ) of the 2-d harmonic oscillator.
For these states, the three-tangle vanishes for all values of a, b and c. Since the amount
of chaos generically varies with the choice of coeﬃcients, this measure will not correlate
with the amount of chaos.

participation ratio as a function of the parameter a. For the states (54), the three-
tangle and the geometric measure of entanglement are independent of a; they have the
value of 0 and 1/2 respectively. The average Lyapunov exponent ¯h varies with a, is
maximal at a = 1/4 and minimal at a = 0 and a = 1/2. Both the participation ratio
and the Meyer-Wallach measure of entanglement have the same general behavior as ¯h
with respect to a. This agreement in behavior can be understood by noticing that the
states |001(cid:105), |010(cid:105) and |100(cid:105) from which |W(a, 1/2 − a, 1/2)(cid:105) is constructed have the
same intrinsic complexity. For a = 0 and a = 1/2, |W(a, 1/2 − a, 1/2)(cid:105) has only two
terms, with one particle decoupling from the others, which explains why the Lyapunov
exponent is minimal for these values.

Figure 10(a) shows ¯h, (c) the Meyer-Wallach and geometric measures of entanglement
and (d) the participation ratio as a function of a. The lower value of ¯h for a = 0 may
originate from the fact that the third particle decouples from the other ones. The lower
value of ¯h for a = 1/2 may come from the fact that then the state is of the form (44)
and as mentioned before admits then one constant of motion. These properties do not
exclude chaos but reduce the possible amount of chaos. The agreement of ¯h with the
Meyer-Wallach and geometric measures of entanglement or the participation ratio is
not as good as in the previous example. The Meyer-Wallach measure and the geometric
measure of entanglement are monotonously increasing functions of a, unlike ¯h which has
a maximum. The participation ratio reaches a maximum, just like ¯h, but its maximum
is reached for a diﬀerent value of a. The discrepancy between the Lyapunov exponent
and the measures of complexity of the wave function originates from the fact that the
former depends on the intrinsic complexity of the terms in the superposition, while the
latter do not. In this case, unlike in the previous example, not all terms have the same
intrinsic complexity due to the presence of the term proportional to |000(cid:105).

As a last example, we consider the state (55) with (cid:104)x|0(cid:105) = φpol

φpol
It has energy 21,
which is higher than the energy of |W(a, 1/4, 1/4)(cid:105). The Lyapunov exponent ¯h for
this state, plotted in ﬁgure 10(b), qualitatively displays the same behavior as in the
case of |W(a, 1/4, 1/4)(cid:105). However, it is interesting to see that for most values of a,
|W(a, 1/4, 1/4)(cid:105) gives higher values of ¯h, despite the fact that this state has lower en-
ergy than |W(cid:48)(a, 1/4, 1/4)(cid:105). So, just as we have already seen before in section 4.2,
increasing the energy of the system does not necessarily leads to a higher amount of
chaos in the Bohmian trajectories. Similar ﬂuctuations as a funtion of the mean energy
where observed in [11].

In summary, not all measures of entanglement lead to a reasonable agreement with
the amount of chaos. For the family of states (53), the three-tangle vanishes whereas the
Bohmian trajectories display variable amount of chaos as a function of the parameters.

Similarly, the geometric measure of entanglement of the states (54) is constant while
the Lyapounov exponent varies as a function of the parameter a. The best agreement is
obtained for the Meyer-Wallach measure of entanglement. However, even this measure
will not always be suitable. For example, for the state φ3p

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we showed that wave functions with an arbitrary number of moving nodes
can lead to constants of motion which prevent chaos for the Bohmian trajectories. Con-
versely, numerical simulations show that single-particle stationary wave functions in 3-d

tionary states for two and three particles in 2-d. The amount of chaos can be related
to the overall complexity of the wave function. We compared the amount of chaos to
the participation ratio and diﬀerent measures of entanglement (three-tangle, geometric
measure of entanglement and Meyer-Wallach measure of entanglement), which to some
degree capture the relevant complexity. We found that the participation ratio and the
Meyer-Wallach measure of entanglement show the best qualitative agreement with the
amount of chaos as measured by the Lyapounov exponent. However, the participation
ratio and the diﬀerent measures of entanglement do not depend on the intrinsic complex-
ity of the basis states. Moreover, the participation ratio does not depend on the relative
phases of the expansion coeﬃcients of the state in the chosen basis. As a consequence,
there cannot be full agreement between these measures of complexity and the amount
of chaos.

A Energy eigenstates for the considered systems

In this appendix, we recall the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues for the potentials we
consider in the paper. In the 2-d case these are harmonic oscillator potential and the
square box potential. In the 3-d case these are the harmonic oscillator potential.

are

These eigenstates are real. States φn1,n2 and φn2,n1 have the same energy. Moreover,
there may be some accidental degeneracy as for example for the states φbox

which simply corresponds to the sum of the Hamiltonians of two 1-d harmonic oscillators
with the same frequency in the x and y direction.

The eigenstates of (cid:98)H2d can be constructed as products of eigenstates of the 1-d

harmonic oscillator and are given by

Alternatively, one can use energy eigenstates that are also eigenstates of the z-

component of angular momentum (cid:98)Lz [24, 25]. In polar coordinates, the common eigen-
states of (cid:98)H2d and (cid:98)Lz are given by
