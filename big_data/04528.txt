are known as theta-constants or Thetanullwerte, where q = eπiτ . In particular, θ3(τ ) is the Thetanullwert
ν=−∞ eπiν 2τ +2πiνz. For an extensive discussion of theta-functions
and theta-constants we refer the reader to [4], [5], and [6]. Recently, the ﬁrst-named author has proven the
following result.

of the Jacobi theta function θ(z|τ ) = P∞

Theorem A. [3, Theorem 1.1] Let q be an algebraic number with q = eπiτ and ℑ(τ ) > 0. Let m ≥ 1 be an
integer. Then, the two numbers θ3(2mτ ) and θ3(τ ) are algebraically independent over Q as well as the two
numbers θ3(nτ ) and θ3(τ ) for n = 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12.

The ﬁrst basic tool in proving such algebraic independence results are integer polynomials in two variables
X, Y , which vanish at certain points X = X0 and Y = Y0 given by values of rational functions of theta-
constants. For instance, for n = 2m (m ≥ 3) we consider the polynomial

Pn(X, Y ) = (cid:0)nX − (1 + Y )2(cid:1)2m−2
where Un(t1, t2, t3) ∈ Q[t1, t2, t3] is a polynomial satisfying

+ Y Un(cid:0)X, (1 + Y )2, Y(cid:1)

Moreover, we have

n

Un(cid:16) 1
Pn(cid:16) θ2

, 1, 0(cid:17) = −22m−1−1 .
θ3(τ )(cid:17) = 0 .

3(nτ )
θ2
3(τ )

θ4(τ )

,

The second tool is an algebraic independence criterion (see Lemma 2.5 below), from which the algebraic
independence of θ3(nτ ) and θ3(τ ) over Q can be obtained by proving that the resultant

does not vanish identically (see [3, Theorem 4.1]). This can be seen as follows. We have the identities

ResX(cid:16) Pn(X, Y ),

∂
∂Y

Pn(X, Y )(cid:17) ∈ Z[Y ]

Pn(X, 0) = (cid:0)2mX − 1(cid:1)2m−2
(X, 0) = −2m−1(cid:0)2mX − 1(cid:1)2m−2−1 + Un(X, 1, 0) ,

,

∂Pn
∂Y

from which on the one hand we deduce that Pn(X, 0) has a 2m−2-fold root at X1 = 1/2m. On the other
hand one has

∂Pn
∂Y

(X1, 0) = Un(cid:16) 1

n

, 1, 0(cid:17) = −22m−1−1 6= 0 .

Hence, for Y = 0 the polynomials Pn(X, Y ) and ∂Pn(X, Y )/∂Y have no common root. Therefore, the
above resultant with respect to X does not vanish identically, which gives the desired result. We state

Algebraic independence results for values of theta-constants, II

the polynomials P2m(X, Y ) for m = 1, 2, 3, 4 explicitly. The algorithm to compute these polynomials
recursivly is given by Lemma 3.1 in [3].

P2 = 2X − Y 2 − 1 ,
P4 = 4X − (1 + Y )2 ,
P8 = 64X 2 − 16(1 + Y )2X + (1 − Y )4 ,
P16 = 65536X 4 − 16384(1 + Y )2X 3 + 512(3Y 4 + 4Y 3 + 18Y 2 + 4Y + 3)X 2

− 64(1 + Y )2(Y 4 + 28Y 3 + 6Y 2 + 28Y + 1)X + (1 − Y )8 ,

Let n ≥ 3 denote an odd positive integer. Set

(j = 2, 3, 4) ,

als Pn(X, Y ) ∈ Z[X, Y ] such that Pn(cid:0)hj(τ ), Rj (λ(τ ))(cid:1) = 0 holds for j = 2, 3, 4, odd integers n ≥ 3, and
Theorem B. [8, Theorem 1, Corollary 3] For any odd integer n ≥ 3 there exists a polynomial Pn(X, Y ) ∈
Z[X, Y ], degX Pn = ψ(n), such that

(1.3)

The polynomials P3, P5, P7, P9, and P11 are listed in the appendix of [3]. P3 and P5 are already given in
[8], P7, P9, and P11 are the results of computer-assisted computations of the ﬁrst-named author.

In this paper we focus on the problem to decide on the algebraic independence of θj(nτ ) and θj(τ )
(j = 2, 3, 4) over Q for algebraic numbers q, where n ≥ 3 is an odd integer or n = 2m, 4m with odd
positive integers m. The above Theorem B will be used in Section 2.

In the following theorems, the number q = eπiτ is an algebraic number with ℑ(τ ) > 0.
Theorem 1.1. Let n ≥ 3 be an odd integer. Then, the numbers in each of the sets
{θ4(nτ ), θ4(τ )}

{θ3(nτ ), θ3(τ )},

{θ2(nτ ), θ2(τ )},

are algebraically independent over Q.
In order to prove this theorem we ﬁrst shall show that for an algebraic number q with 0 < |q| < 1 the
numbers h2(τ ), h3(τ ), and h4(τ ) are transcendental (Lemma 2.3). This interim result already shows that
the two numbers θj(nτ ) and θj(τ ) (j = 2, 3, 4) are homogeneously algebraically independent over Q.
On the other hand, it has not been shown that Theorem 1.1 holds for arbitrary even integers n. However we
can prove it for small even integers n by checking the non-vanishing of a Jacobian determinant (Lemma 2.5),
which is hard to decide when the involved polynomials are not given explicitly.

Theorem 1.2. For n = 2, 4, 6, the numbers θ2(nτ ) and θ2(τ ) are algebraically independent over Q.
Theorem 1.3. For n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, the numbers θ4(nτ ) and θ4(τ ) are algebraically independent over Q.
Theorem 1.4. Let 2 ≤ n ≤ 22 be an even integer. Then, the numbers θ3(nτ ) and θ3(τ ) are algebraically
independent over Q.

2 Auxiliary results

In this section, we prepare some lemmas to prove theorems.
Lemma 2.1. [2, Lemma 4] Let q be an algebraic number with q = eπiτ and ℑ(τ ) > 0. Then, any two
numbers in the set in each of the sets

are algebraically independent over Q.

(cid:8)θ2(τ ), θ3(τ ), θ4(τ )(cid:9)

This result can be derived from Yu.V. Nesterenko’s theorem [7] on the algebraic independence of the values
P (q), Q(q), R(q) of the Ramanujan functions P, Q, R at a nonvanishing algebraic point q. It should be
noticed that the three numbers θ2(τ ), θ3(τ ), and θ4(τ ) are algebraically dependent over Q, since the identity

θ4
3(τ ) = θ4

2(τ ) + θ4

4(τ )

(2.1)

holds for any τ ∈ C with ℑ(τ ) > 0.
In what follows, we distinguish two cases based on the parity of n.

2.1 The case where n is odd
The following subsequent Lemmas 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 are needed to prove Theorem 1.1. Let n ≥ 3 be a ﬁxed
odd integer and τ ∈ C with ℑ(τ ) > 0. From Theorem B we know that there exists a nonzero polynomial
Pn(X, Y ) ∈ Z[X, Y ] with degX Pn = ψ(n) such that Pn(X0, Y0) vanishes for

X0 := h3(τ ) = n2 θ4
3(nτ )

Y0 := 16λ(τ ) = 16

,

.

Let N := degY Pn(X, Y ). The polynomials Qj(X) ∈ Z[X] (j = 0, 1, . . . , N ) are given by

Pn(X, Y ) =

Qj(X)Y j .

N

Xj=0

(2.2)

Lemma 2.2. For any complex number α, there exists a subscript j = j(α) such that Qj(α) 6= 0.
Proof of Lemma 2.2. Suppose on the contrary that there exists an α ∈ C such that Qj(α) = 0 for all
j = 0, 1, . . . , N. It follows from (2.2) that there exists a polynomial Rn(X, Y ) ∈ C[X, Y ] satisfying

Pn(X, Y ) = (X − α)Rn(X, Y ) .

(2.3)

In accordance with formula (5) in [8] we deﬁne for any τ ∈ C with ℑ(τ ) > 0 the numbers

xν (τ ) := u2 θ4

3(cid:0) uτ +2v
w (cid:1)

θ4
3(τ )

(cid:0)ν = 1, 2, . . . , ψ(n)(cid:1) ,

Algebraic independence results for values of theta-constants, II

where the nonnegative integers u, v, w are given by [8, Lemma 1]. These integers depend on n and ν and
satisfy the three conditions

Substituting Y = 16λ(τ ) into (2.3), we have by [8, Corollary 1]

(u, v, w) = 1 ,

uw = n ,

0 ≤ v < w .

ψ(n)

Yν=1(cid:0)X − xν(τ )(cid:1) = Pn(cid:0)X, 16λ(τ )(cid:1) = (X − α)Rn(cid:0)X, 16λ(τ )(cid:1) .

Next, by substituting X = α into (2.5), we obtain

ψ(n)

Yν=1(cid:0)α − xν(τ )(cid:1) = 0

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

for any τ ∈ C with ℑ(τ ) > 0. Let ak := nki (k = 1, 2, . . . ) be a sequence of complex numbers on the
imaginary axis. Then we get by (2.6)

ψ(n)

Yν=1(cid:0)α − xν(ak)(cid:1) = 0

(k = 1, 2, . . . ) .

Hence, by the pigeonhole principle, there is a subscript ν0 with 1 ≤ ν0 ≤ ψ(n) such that

u2 θ4

3(cid:0) ubk+2v

w
θ4
3(bk)

(cid:1)

= xν0(bk) = α

(2.7)

holds for some subsequence {bk}k≥1 of {ak}k≥1. The integers u, v, w in (2.7) depend on n, ν0 and satisfy
the condions in (2.4). Since 4pα/u2 takes four complex values, we see in the same way by applying the
pigeonhole principle that there exists a complex number β with β4 = α/u2 such that

w

θ3(cid:0) uck+2v

θ3(ck)

(cid:1)

= β

(2.8)

holds for some subsequence {ck}k≥1 of {bk}k≥1. Let ck := ntki, where tk (k ≥ 1) are positive integers
with t1 < t2 < . . . . Then, by substituting τ = ck into q = eπiτ = e−πtkn, we obtain

θ3(ck) = 1 + 2

Setting ηk := e−πtk (k = 1, 2, . . . ), it follows from (2.8) to (2.10) that

βf (ηk) = g(ηk)

(k = 1, 2, . . . ) .

The sequence {ηk}k≥1 tends to zero, such that we may apply the identity theorem for power series. We
obtain

βf (z) = g(z)

(|z| < 1) .

Comparing the ﬁrst and second nonvanishing coefﬁcients of the series, it follows that β = 1, and, by
applying uw = n in (2.4), u2 = n, u = w = √n > 1, ξv
w = 1
and 0 ≤ v < w in (2.4) that v = 0. Finally, we deduce that (u, v, w) = (u, 0, u) = u > 1, which contradicts
the arithmetic condition (u, v, w) = 1 in (2.4). This completes the proof of Lemma 2.2.

w = 1. Since ξw 6= 1, we conclude from ξv

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.3. Let q be an algebraic number with q = eπiτ and ℑ(τ ) > 0. Then the three numbers h2(τ ),
h3(τ ), and h4(τ ) are transcendental.

Proof of Lemma 2.3. We suppose on the contrary that h3(τ ) is an algebraic number. Then it follows from
(2.2) and from Lemma 2.2 that

F (Y ) := Pn(cid:0)h3(τ ), Y(cid:1) =

N

Xj=0

Qj(cid:0)h3(τ )(cid:1)Y j

is a nonzero polynomial with algebraic coefﬁcients. Hence, the identity (1.2) yields F(cid:0)16λ(τ )(cid:1) = 0,

thus showing that λ(τ ) = θ4
2(τ )
is an algebraic number. But, by Lemma 2.1, the numbers θ2(τ ) and
θ4
3(τ )
θ3(τ ) are algebraically independent over Q, a contradiction. Thus, h3(τ ) is transcendental. Similarly,
the transcendence of h2(τ ) and h4(τ ) follows from the identities (1.1) and (1.3).
(cid:3)
Lemma 2.4. Let α1, α2 ∈ C be algebraically independent over Q and let β1, β2 ∈ C (β2 6= 0) such that
β1/β2 is transcendental. Suppose that there exist nonzero polynomials P (X, Y ), Q(X, Y ) ∈ Q[X, Y ] such
that
(2.11)

P (α1/α2, β1/β2) = 0.

and

Q(β1, β2) = α2.

(2.12)

Then β1 and β2 are algebraically independent over Q.

Proof of Lemma 2.4. Deﬁne the ﬁelds F := Q(β1, β2) and E := F (α1, α2). We ﬁrst prove that the ﬁeld
extension E/F is algebraic. Since α2 ∈ F by (2.12), we only have to show that α1 is algebraic over F . Let

P (X, Y ) :=

ℓ

Xj=0

Rj(Y )X j ,

Rj(Y ) ∈ Q[Y ],

Rℓ(Y ) 6≡ 0,

Algebraic independence results for values of theta-constants, II

and deﬁne

ℓ

f (X) :=

Rj(β1/β2)(X/α2)j ∈ F [X],

Xj=0

where f (X) is a nonzero polynomial, since Rℓ(β1/β2) 6= 0 follows from the transcendence of β1/β2. By
(2.11), we have f (α1) = P (α1/α2, β1/β2) = 0, which implies that α1 is algebraic over F .
Thus we get

trans. deg F/Q = trans. deg E/F + trans. deg F/Q = trans. deg E/Q ≥ 2,

where we used the algebraic independence hypothesis on α1 and α2. On the other hand, trans. deg F/Q ≤ 2
is trivial. Therefore we obtain

trans. deg F/Q = 2,

which gives the desired result.

2.2 The case where n is even

We need the the expressions of θj(2ℓτ ) (j = 2, 3, 4, ℓ = 1, 2, 3) in terms of θj := θj(τ ) (j = 2, 3, 4), which
will be used to prove Theorems 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4. Recall that the following identities hold for any τ ∈ C
with ℑ(τ ) > 0:

2(2τ ) = θ2
2θ2
3(2τ ) = θ2
2θ2
θ2
4(2τ ) = θ3θ4 ,

3 − θ2
4 ,
3 + θ2
4 ,

and

(2.13)
(2.14)
(2.15)

(2.16)
(2.17)
(2.18)

2θ2(4τ ) = θ3 − θ4 ,
2θ3(4τ ) = θ3 + θ4 ,
4(4τ ) = (cid:0)θ2
2θ4
3 + θ2

4(cid:1)θ3θ4 .

The most important tool to transfer the algebraic independence of a set of m numbers to another set of m
numbers, which all satisfy a system of algebraic identities, is given by the following lemma. We call it an
algebraic independence criterion (AIC).
Lemma 2.5. [1, Lemma 3.1] Let x1, . . . , xm ∈ C be algebraically independent over Q and let y1, . . . , ym ∈
C satisfy the system of equations

fj(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , ym) = 0

(1 ≤ j ≤ m) ,

where fj(t1, . . . , tm, u1, . . . , um) ∈ Q[t1, . . . , tm, u1, . . . , um] (1 ≤ j ≤ m). Assume that

det(cid:18) ∂fj

∂ti

(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , ym)(cid:19) 6= 0 .

Then the numbers y1, . . . , ym are algebraically independent over Q.
We shall apply the AIC to the sets {x1, x2} with x1, x2 ∈ Z[θ2, θ3, θ4].

2.2.1 The case n = 2m with odd integer m

In this subsection, we put n = 2m with an odd integer m > 1. In Lemmas 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 below, we
give sufﬁcient conditions for the numbers in each of the set {θj(nτ ), θj(τ )} (j = 2, 3, 4) to be algebraically
independent over Q. Replacing τ by 2τ in (1.1), (1.2), and (1.3), we have

Let q be an algebraic number with q = eπiτ and ℑ(τ ) > 0. The total degree of Pm(X, Y ) is denoted by M.
Lemma 2.6. If the polynomial

does not vanish identically, then the numbers θ2(nτ ) and θ2(τ ) are algebraically independent over Q.

Proof of Lemma 2.6. Let

x1

4)2 ,
2(nτ ) ,

x2
y2

3 + θ2

Then the numbers x1 and x2 are algebraically independent over Q. Indeed, the numbers θ3 and θ4 are the
roots of polynomial

so that the ﬁeld E := Q(θ3, θ4) is an algebraic extension of F := Q(x1, x2), and hence by Lemma 2.1

trans. deg F/Q = trans. deg E/F + trans. deg F/Q = trans. deg E/Q = 2.

By the identities (2.13) and (2.14), the numbers X0 and Y0 in (2.19) are expressed as

X0 =

2.2.2 The case n = 4m with odd integer m

Lemma 2.9. Let n = 4m, where m > 1 is an odd integer. Let q be an algebraic number with q = eπiτ and

x1

:= 2θ3 ,
:= 16m2θ4

x2

3 Proof of Theorems

Carsten Elsner

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We consider the case of θ3(τ ). Let

α1 := 16θ4
2,

α2 := θ4
3,

β1 := n2θ4

3(nτ ),

β2 := θ4
3,

where, by Lemmas 2.1 and 2.3, the numbers α1 and α2 are algebraically independent over Q and the number
β1/β2 = h3(τ ) is transcendental. Deﬁne P (X, Y ) := Pn(Y, X) and Q(X, Y ) := Y . By (1.2)

and

P (α1/α2, β1/β2) = Pn(h3(τ ), 16λ(τ )) = 0

Q(β1, β2) = β2 = α2.

Hence, applying Lemma 2.4, we obtain the algebraic independence over Q of the numbers β1 and β2. This
implies that the numbers θ3(nτ ) and θ3(τ ) are algebraically independent over Q.
The same holds for the sets {θ2(nτ ), θ2(τ )} and {θ4(nτ ), θ4(τ )}. In these cases, we use the identities (1.1),
(1.3) and Lemma 2.4 with

α1 := 16(θ4

β1 := n2θ4

2 − θ4
3),
2(nτ ),

α2 := θ4
2,

β2 := θ4
2,

and

P (X, Y ) := Pn(Y, X),

Q(X, Y ) := Y,

α1 := 16θ4
2,

β1 := n2θ4

4(nτ ),

α2 := θ4

2 − θ4
3,
β2 := θ4
4,

respectively. In the latter case, we note that the equality Q(β1, β2) = α2 holds from the identity (2.1). Thus,
the proof of Theorem 1.1 is completed.

P (X, Y ) := Pn(Y, X),

Q(X, Y ) = −Y,

Proof of Theorem 1.2. We ﬁrst consider the case n = 2. Let F := Q(x1, x2), where x1 := 2θ2
x2 := θ4
and

2. Then by the identity (2.13) together with the relation θ4

2(2τ ) and
4, we have F ⊂ E := Q(θ3, θ4)

2x1θ2

3 − x2

1 − x2 = 2x1θ2

2 = θ4

3 − θ4
1 − x2 = 0.

4 + x2

This implies that the ﬁeld extension E/F is algebraic, so that

trans deg F/Q = trans deg E/F + trans deg F/Q = trans deg E/Q = 2,

which implies that the numbers θ2(2τ ) and θ2(τ ) are are algebraically independent over Q. For n = 4,
putting F := Q(2θ2(4τ ), θ4
2) and using (2.16), we can proceed the same argument as stated above. For
x1 := 2θ2(4τ ) and x2 := θ4
2 we use the identities

θ4

3 −(cid:0)x1 − θ3(cid:1)4 − x2 = θ4

4 −(cid:0)x1 + θ4(cid:1)4 + x2 = 0 .

Algebraic independence results for values of theta-constants, II

In the case of n = 6, we use Lemma 2.6. From [8] we know that

Hence, we have

P3(X, Y ) = 9 −(cid:0)Y 2 − 16Y + 28(cid:1)X + 30X 2 − 12X 3 + X 4 .

= 9Y(cid:0)5Y − 512(cid:1)(cid:0)Y − 16(cid:1)2(cid:0)Y − 8(cid:1)4 6≡ 0 .

Lemma 2.6 gives the desired result for n = 6.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. Similarly to the proof of Theorem 1.2, we can deduce the conclusion for the cases
n = 2, 4, 8 by using the identities (2.15), (2.18), and

which is yielded from (2.14), (2.15), and (2.18). In the cases of n = 6, 10, we use Lemma 2.8. For n = 6
we compute the resultant from the lemma explicitly.

(X, Y )(cid:19)2

(X, Y )(cid:19)2!

Next, let n = 10. In [8] the polynomial P5(X, Y ) is given as well.

P5(X, Y ) = 25 − (126 − 832Y + 308Y 2 − 32Y 3 + Y 4)X + (255 + 1920Y − 120Y 2)X 2

+ (−260 + 320Y − 20Y 2)X 3 + 135X 4 − 30X 5 + X 6 .

Hence, by setting

T10(Y ) := Res X P5(X, Y ), X 2(cid:18) ∂P5

∂X

(X, Y )(cid:19)2

− Y(cid:0)Y − 16(cid:1)(cid:18) ∂P5

∂Y

(X, Y )(cid:19)2! ,

we obtain T10(1) ≡ 1 (mod 2), such that T10(Y ) does not vanish identically. This completes the proof of
Theorem 1.3.

Proof of Theorem 1.4. Taking the results from Theorem A and Theorem 1.1 into account, for Theorem 1.4
it sufﬁces to consider n ∈ {14, 18, 20, 22}. Here, we compute the resultants from Lemma 2.7 (for n ∈
{14, 18, 22}) and from Lemma 2.9 (for n = 20) explicitly by using a computer algebra system. In order to
show that the resultants do not vanish we again consider the values at Y = 1. For n = 14 we use

P7(X, Y ) = 49 − (344 − 17568Y + 20554Y 2 − 6528Y 3 + 844Y 4 − 48Y 5 + Y 6)X

+ (1750 + 31360Y − 1960Y 2)X 4 − (1064 − 2464Y + 154Y 2)X 5

and thus T18(1) ≡ 1 (mod 2). Hence, T18(1) 6= 0. For n = 20 we need the polynomial P5(X, Y ), which
was already used in the proof of Theorem 1.3. The resultant from Lemma 2.9,
