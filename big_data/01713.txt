Abstract

Aim. To improve treatment plan robustness with respect to small shifts in patient position during the VMAT treatment
by ensuring a linear ramp-like dose proﬁle in treatment ﬁeld overlap regions.

Background. Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is considered technically challenging because the target size exceeds the
maximal ﬁeld size, which necessitates using abutted or overlapping treatment ﬁelds. Volumetric modulated arc therapy
(VMAT) is increasingly being examined for CSI, as it oﬀers both better dose homogeneity and better dose conformance
while also oﬀering a possibility to create ﬁeld junctions which are more robust towards small shifts in patient position
during the treatment.

Materials and Methods. A VMAT treatment plan with three isocenters was made for a test case patient. Three groups of
overlapping arc ﬁeld pairs were used; one for the cranial and two for the spinal part. In order to assure a ramp-like dose
proﬁle in the ﬁeld overlap region, the upper spinal part was optimised ﬁrst, with dose prescription explicitely enforcing a
ramp-like dose proﬁle. The cranial and lower spinal part were done afterwards, taking into account the dose contribution
of the upper spinal ﬁelds.

Results. Using simple geometrical reasoning, we demonstrated that hot- and cold spots which arise from small displace-
ment of one treatment ﬁeld relative to the other treatment ﬁeld can be reduced by taking two precautions: (a) widening
the ﬁeld overlap region, and (b) reducing the ﬁeld gradient across the overlap region. The function with the smallest
maximal gradient is a linear ramp. We present a treatment planning technique which yields the desired dose proﬁle of
the two contributing ﬁelds, and minimises dosimetric dependence on minor positional errors in patient set-up.

1. Background and aim

Craniospinal irradiation is a technically challenging task.

The length of the planning target volume (PTV) exceeds
the maximal size of a treatment ﬁeld, thus requiring some
method of combining treatment ﬁelds to treat the whole
target. While the standard set-up for craniospinal irradi-
ation is still based on the set-up described by Van Dyk
almost 40 years ago [1], other modalities such as inten-
sity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) [2–7], volumet-
ric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) [8–11], tomotherapy
[12, 13], and proton therapy [14] are increasingly being
examined as a possibility for cranio-spinal irradiation.

The studies seem to agree that both IMRT and VMAT
treatment planning oﬀer both a more conformal and a
more homogeneous dose coverage of the target and better
sparing of some organs at risk (e.g., thyroid gland) with

respect to the traditional 3D CRT approach, while at the
same time they raise concern about the increased dose to
other organs at risk, in particular lungs and kidneys.

A particular problem in the craniospinal irradiation are
the ﬁeld junctions. Set-up inaccuracies of a few milime-
ters in the cranio-caudal direction can result in large over-
or underdosing. In conventional set-up, moving the treat-
ment ﬁeld junction after a given dose, usually every 9 Gy,
has been adopted both for reducing dose inhomogeneity
and to minimise over- or underdosing which can occur due
to systematic errors; the technique is known as “feather-
ing” [15]. Studies using IMRT employ a variety of ﬁeld-
junction techniques: “hybrid” junction [2], “jagged-junction”
[4, 5], and ﬁeld overlap [7] techniques, while studies using
VMAT use almost exclusively the ﬁeld overlap technique
[8, 10], relying on the optimiser algorithm to arrive at a
smooth ﬁeld overlap junction.

In the present study, we focus exclusively on the ﬁeld
junction area. We show that a wider ﬁeld junction can
result in a smaller dosimetric impact of a given positional

error. We also demonstrate that, left to itself, the dose op-
timiser algorithm may not arrive at a dose proﬁle which is
the most robust towards small positional errors in patient
set-up. Finally, we present a treatment planning procedure
which reduces the dosimetric impact of positional errors.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Idealised ﬁeld junction

We start by showing that in two overlapping treatment
ﬁelds, a linear ramp is the dose proﬁle which yields hot-
and cold spots of the smallest magnitude when one ﬁeld
is displaced by a small amount with respect to the other.
Denoting dose contributions of the two treatment ﬁelds
by f (x) and g(x), where f (x) + g(x) = 1, with f (x) = 0
and g(x) = 1 for x ≤ 0 and f (x) = 1 and g(x) = 0 for
x ≥ L, we are interested in the deviation of the sum of both
contributions from unity, with one ﬁeld being displaced by
∆x:

1 − (f (x) + g(x + ∆x)) = f (x + ∆x) − f (x).

When the displacement ∆x is small, we may expand the
above diﬀerence in a Taylor series and, retaining only the
linear term in ∆x, we obtain:

1 − (f (x) + g(x + ∆x)) ≈ f(cid:48)(x) ∆x.

Thus, at a given shift ∆x, dose deviation is proportional
to the dose gradient f(cid:48)(x). Of all the functions raising
from 0 to 1 over the distance L, the linear function has
the smallest maximal gradient.

Another quantity of interest would be the average de-

viation of the dose from unity across the ﬁeld junction:

(cid:90) L

f(cid:48)(x) dx

(cid:90) L−∆x

[1 − (f (x) + g(x + ∆x))] dx ≈ ∆x

.

Thus, for small displacements, when ∆x (cid:28) L holds and
terms in ∆x/L higher than linear can be neglected, the
shape of dose proﬁle only aﬀects the magnitude of hot-
and cold spots, but not the average dose deviation.

Fig. 1 shows the dose proﬁle across a ﬁeld junction in
which f (x) and g(x) are represented by linear ramps, one
of them shifted with respect to the other. The contribu-
tions of the two overlapping groups of ﬁelds (with VMAT,
a group of ﬁelds is usually a pair of arc ﬁelds; with IMRT
it is usually 5–7 ﬁelds) – f (x) and g(x) – are shown in
red and green, respectively, and the total dose shown in
blue.
In this simpliﬁed example, we arrive at the same
expression for dose deviation ∆D:

∆D = 100% · ∆x
L

.

As an illustration, a 5 mm positional shift is expected to
result in a 5% dose diﬀerence across a 10 cm ﬁeld junction.
The ratio 100%/L is the dose gradient.

individual ﬁeld contributions of are shown in red and green, respec-
tively, and the total dose shown in blue. A positional shift ∆x of
one dose contribution with respect to the other results in a dose
diﬀerence of ∆D.

2.2. Patient and target selection

An adolescent female patient (18 yo) was selected as
a test case. The patient had undergone CT simulation in
supine position with the head and shoulders immobilised
in a thermoplastic mask and the arms resting comfortably
at the patient’s sides. PTV encompassed the whole brain
and spinal cord down to S2 vertebra, resulting in a total
length of 75.9 cm. The prescribed dose to this target was
30.6 Gy in 17 fractions.

2.3. Treatment planning

Treatment planning was done on Eclipse 10.0 treat-
ment planning system, with Varian Unique Performance
equipped with Millenium MLC 120 and Exact IGRT couch
as the target treatment machine (Varian Medical Systems,
Palo Alto, CA, USA). The treatment plans were generated
using Progressive Resolution Optimiser algorithm PRO3
[16], and the dose was computed with the Analytical Aniso-
tropic algorithm (AAA) using 2.5 mm calculation grid res-
olution.

To cover the whole PTV, 3 isocenters in the cranial,
upper spinal (Th3) and lower spinal (L2) region were cho-
sen, with 23 cm separating the cranial and the upper spinal
isocenters, and 26 cm separating both spinal isocenters. To
simplify patient positioning, the coordinates of the three
isocenters only diﬀered in the cranio-caudal direction. The
ﬁeld set-up used by center C in [8] was adopted, with two
partial arcs used at each isocenter, avoiding irradiation
from the anterior position by omitting the sector 310◦–50◦,
and the collimator rotated to 10◦ and 350◦, respectively.
Dose optimisation was performed in two steps. The
treatment plan for the upper spinal region was made in
the ﬁrst step. Within the upper spinal region, a central
region (PTVt; 14.4 cm) was deﬁned with a homogeneous
dose prescription, surrounded by two 10.8 cm transitional
regions (Fig. 2). Each of the transitional regions was fur-
ther divided into 9 subregions, each extending 1.2 cm in
the cranio-caudal direction. The dose prescription in each
subregion gradually increased from the periphery towards
the center; i.e. to both outermost subregions (labelled as

DxLDΔxΔFigure 2: Sagittal view showing the auxilliary structures used for treatment planning.

1 in Fig. 2) a dose of 0–3.4 Gy was prescribed, to the adje-
cent regions (2) a dose of 3.4–6.8 Gy was prescribed, and
so on, up to the innermost subregions (9), to which a dose
of 27.2–30.6 Gy was prescribed.

After the treatment plan for the upper spinal region
had been optimised, the treatment plans covering the cra-
nial and lower spinal regions were made, taking into ac-
count the dose distrubution for the upper spinal region,
and ﬁlling up the dose to the prescribed value.

2.4. Positional error simulation

A positional error in the cranio-caudal direction was
simulated by taking an already optimised plan and mak-
ing two modiﬁcations to it: the isocenter position for the
cranial pair of treatment ﬁelds was moved 5 mm in the
cranial direction, and the isocenter position for the lower
spinal pair of ﬁelds was moved 5 mm in the caudal direc-
tion. The dose was recalculated while keeping the same
monitor unit count. In a complementary simulation, the
isocenter position for the cranial pair of treatment ﬁelds
was moved 5 mm in the caudal direction, and the isocenter
position for the lower spinal pair of ﬁelds was moved 5 mm
in the cranial direction. The same procedure was repeated
for the positional shifts of ±1, ±3, ±7, and ±10 mm.

2.5. Treatment plan veriﬁcation

The treatment plan was veriﬁed using ﬁlm dosimetry
(Gafchromic EBT3; Ashland, Wayne, NJ, USA). A ra-
diochromic ﬁlm was mounted into the slot for ﬁlm dosime-
try in the IBA MultiCube phantom (IBA Dosimetry, Schwarzen-
bruck, Germany), with the phantom turned onto its side
so that the ﬁlm lied in the sagittal plane. Irradiated ﬁlms
were later analysed using a web application for radiochromic
ﬁlm dosimetry (Radiochromic.com, v2.2; https://radiochromic.
com/) [17], using a correction for scanner response vari-
ability [18].

3. Results

3.1. Dose proﬁles

In order to determine the minimum number of seg-
ments needed to obtain a smooth linear ramp dose proﬁle
in the transition region, we ran a separate experiment. In
the dose optimisation step for the treatment ﬁeld for the
upper spinal region, the transitional region (17 CT slices,
separated 6 mm apart, total length 96 mm) was divided
into either 3, 4, 6, or 9 segments. Figure 3a shows the
dose proﬁle contributed by the upper spinal ﬁelds to the
spinal-spinal junction. Figure 3b shows the distribution of
dose gradient along the transitional region for the above
mentioned segmentations, presented as box plots. A linear
ramp has a uniform slope of 100%/96 mm, or 10.4%/cm.
One can see that increasing the number of segments leads
to a dose proﬁle closer to the desired linear ramp.

For diﬀerent treatment plans, Figs. 4a–l show a dose
proﬁle along a line between the same two points in the
patient’s body, encompassing the spinal-spinal junction.
The contribution of the two upper spinal arc ﬁelds (clock-
wise and counter-clockwise summed up) is shown in green,
the contribution of the two lower spinal ﬁelds is shown in
red, and the total dose in blue. Dose proﬁles in Figs. 4a,b
have both been obtained by using the progressive resolu-
tion optimiser PRO3 on two overlapping pairs of VMAT
ﬁelds, the only diﬀerence being that in Fig. 4a, the over-
lap region is narrow (2.5 cm), while in Fig. 4b, it is wide
(12.0 cm). Fig. 4c shows the dose proﬁle along a linear
ramp junction (10.4 cm) described in the previous section.
By comparing Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b, it is clear that sim-
ply widening the junction does not result in a signiﬁcantly
smaller dose gradient of either upper or lower spinal ﬁeld
contribution. Instead, the dose optimiser algorithm pro-
duces a fairly constant total dose across the junction us-
ing non-monotonous upper or lower spinal ﬁeld contribu-
tions, each of them still having areas of steep dose gradient.
Fig. 4c, however, shows that the treatment planning tech-

segments. The horizontal line corresponds to a uniform gradient (b).

nique presented in the previous section results in a dose
proﬁle which is close to the ideal (Fig. 1).

Figs. 4d–f show the behaviour of the ﬁeld junctions
shown in Figs. 4a–c in a simulated case in which the dis-
tance between the isocenters of the upper and lower spinal
ﬁelds has been increased by 5 mm. As expected, a large
drop in the total dose is observed in the regions where the
upper and lower spinal ﬁelds have a high dose gradient.
In a similar manner, Figs. 4g–i show the behaviour of the
ﬁeld junctions shown in Figs. 4a–c in a simulated case in
which the distance between the isocenters of the upper and
lower spinal ﬁelds has been decreased by 5 mm. Again, a
large rise in the total dose is observed in the regions of
high dose gradient.

Figs. 4j–l show the dose distribution along the dose pro-
ﬁle line in the junction area for the ﬁeld junctions shown
in Figs. 4a–c. Black lines correspond to no positional shift,
red lines to the distance between the isocenters increased
by 5 mm, and blue lines to the distance between the isocen-
ters decreased by 5 mm. While a 5 mm shift of one of
the ﬁelds with respect to the other can result in a ±30%
change in dose in the case of a narrow junction, this value
drops to ±15% in the case of a wide junction, and down
to ±10% in the case of a linear ramp junction. Note this
coincides fairly well with the previous estimates for an ide-
alised ﬁeld junction: as the original treatment plan aimed
to cover the target with 95–105% of the prescribed dose,
a 5 mm positional shift over a 10 cm junction is expected
to pull the dose up or down by another 5%, depending on
the direction of the shift.
Counting merely the percentage of points staying within
the [95%, 107%] dose range after a ±5 mm shift is per-
formed, the linear ramp dose proﬁle does not oﬀer a sig-
niﬁcant improvement over other dose proﬁles at compa-

rable junction widths. A narrow junction clearly shows
the worst results, with only 10% and 13% points staying
within the prescribed dose range after the the distance
between the isocenters increased or decreased by 5 mm,
respectively. With a wide junction, these values climb up
to 73% and 71%, respectively, while in the case of a linear
ramp junction, they are 68% and 91%. Thus, while overall
a linear ramp junction performs slightly better, we don’t
consider this diﬀerence as important as the magnitude by
which the dose departs from the prescribed range.

For a linear ramp junction, the sensitivity of the dose
coverage within the transitional area to the magnitude of
positional shift has been assessed (Figure 5). In this exper-
iment, after dose optimisation, the isocenter of the lower
spinal treatment ﬁeld pair was shifted ±1 to ±10 mm in
the cranial or caudal direction, and the dose was recal-
culated. Dose distribution within the transitional area of
the spinal-spinal junction is shown as a box plot. One can
see that a positional shift up to ±3 mm generally leads to
dose distributions which are within the [95%, 107%] range,
which is considered acceptable [19], while larger positional
shifts, even though they may still yield an acceptable dose
distribution in some circumstances, are generally consid-
ered unacceptable.

3.2. Dosimetric inﬂuence of arm movement

Using the whole arc except the sector [300◦, 50◦] for
irradiation means irradiating through the patient’s arms.
While this has been done with suitable immobilisation [20],
it is generally not advised, because of the dosimetric in-
accuracies induced by a non-deliberate change in the pa-
tient’s arms position. In a separate simulated experiment,
we estimated the eﬀect of a complete omission of the pa-
tient’s arms: after optimising the treatment plan, the same

treatment plan was recalculated on another structure set,
identical to the original one with the exception of the pa-
tient’s arms being excluded from the calculation volume.
As expected this produced a slightly higher dose at the
same MU value, with D50% for the spinal PTV rising from
101.3% of the prescribed dose to 103.1% of the prescribed
dose. Similarly, D98% rose from 94.8% to 96.8% of the pre-
scribed dose, and D2% rose from 104.2% to 107.5% of the
prescribed dose. This is the extreme case; we can expect
that a minor change in position would induce a dosimetric
error smaller than this worst-case scenario. The relatively
low impact of arm displacement is consistent with a rela-
tively low dose received by the patient’s arms; even though
no special restrictions to the dose in the arms were used,
the maximal dose to both humeri stayed at around 10% of
the dose prescribed to PTV.

[21], 3% dose tolerance and 3 mm positional tolerance was
used along with a threshold value set at 10% of Dmax and
global normalization, resulting in the average γ value of
0.16 and 99.7% points passing γ < 1 criterion. Points
with γ < 1 are shown in blue, and points with γ > 1 are

4. Discussion

4.1. Prone vs. supine patient position

While the original set-up for craniospinal irradiation
[1] employed a prone patient position, there are numerous
studies advocating the supine patient position [22–25]. Af-
ter judging the advantages and the disadvantages of both
set-ups, we decided to employ it as well. The obvious ad-
vantage of the prone position – easier visualisation of treat-
ment ﬁeld junctions – became less important with the ad-
vancement of image-guided radiotherapy, which made the
supine position a viable alternative, allowing for greater
patient comfort and easier access for the paediatric pa-
tients requiring anaesthesia.

4.2. Dose proﬁle in ﬁeld overlap area

While the studies treating the craniospinal axis using
IMRT often paid special attention to achieving a desired
dose proﬁle in the ﬁeld junction area (e.g., staircase, [4, 5]),
the studies using VMAT usually seem to rely on the dose
optimiser to obtain a suitable dose proﬁle. As we have
shown earlier, this often results in non-monotonous dose
proﬁles.

However, a recent study [26] dealing with the robust-
ness of treatment plans with respect to positional shifts of
the patient claims that the authors speciﬁcally aimed for
a sigmoidal dose proﬁle in the ﬁeld overlap region. In an-
other study on localization errors [11] the authors propose
a staircase dose proﬁle in order to minimize such errors.
An interesting feature of this study is that the authors

tion region was too narrow to support staircase dose pro-
ﬁle ([11], Fig. 4a), but brushed it oﬀ as a mere curiosity
without realising that it gives even better results than the
technique they propose. Using a linear ramp instead of a
staircase dose proﬁle, we predict the ±10% spikes observed
by Myers et al. ([11], Fig. 3b,d), which correspond to a
±5 mm shift applied to a 116 mm overlap region, would
drop down to ∼ 5%.

4.3. Maximal vs. average positional errors

Earlier studies [26, 27] have proven that the position
shifts in the cranio-caudal direction result in greater dosi-
metric changes than the shifts in the other two directions.
Consequently, we limited our study to the cranio-caudal
direction. A comparision of the dosimetric changes re-
ported in [26, 27] to the ones reported here is diﬃcult
for two reasons: (a) we examined local eﬀects (hot- and
cold spots) rather than their inﬂuence on the volume-dose
histogram, and (b) we evaluated the dosimetric impact
of the maximal shift, i.e., ±5 mm, while the authors in
[26, 27] chose three random values from the [−5 mm,
+5 mm] range and used their mean and standard devi-
ation. Assuming that the samples are distributed uni-
formly, the mean of several uniform distribution is a rect-
angular mean distribution, sometimes called Bates distri-
bution. For 3 uniformly distributed samples taken from
the [−5 mm, +5 mm], the expected mean and standard
deviation is 0 ± 1.67 mm. It can be argued that this ap-
proach better reﬂects the reality of a clinical department;
however we have deliberately chosen more direct observ-
ables which allow for easier analysis. A 21% increase of the
maximum dose reported in [26] is however close to the ex-
pected value of 25% for a 5 mm shift in the cranio-caudal
direction applied to a 20 mm overlap region.

4.4. Quality assurance of medical accelerators

Craniospinal irradiation, in particular when performed
in its conventional set-up, is a technique which leaves lit-
tle margin for errors. As its requirements are close to the
tolerance levels speciﬁed in the quality assurance (QA) rec-
ommendations for medical accelerators, it is important to
consider the relevant parameters. The conventional set-up
relies on the jaw position for half-beam block and the treat-
ment couch position; tolerance levels for them are 1 mm
and 2 mm, respectively, both are checked monthly [28].

With image-guided techniques, assuring that the imag-
ing system isocenter coincides with the treatment isocen-
ter is of prime importance. The suggested tolerance levels
here are 1.5–2 mm, checked monthly [29, 30]. The inac-
curacies introduced by mis-alignment result in systematic
errors which do not cancel out by day-to-day variations.

5. Conclusions

Using an idealised schematic ﬁeld junction with par-
tial ﬁeld overlap, we have shown that hot- and cold spots

7

which arise from small displacement of one treatment ﬁeld
relative to the other treatment ﬁeld can be reduced by
taking two precautions: (a) widening the ﬁeld overlap re-
gion, and (b) reducing the ﬁeld gradient across the overlap
region. The function with the smallest maximal gradient
is a linear ramp, and we presented a treatment planning
technique for craniospinal irradiation which yields the de-
sired dose proﬁle of the two contributing ﬁelds, and min-
imises dosimetric dependence on minor positional errors
in patient set-up. The treatment planning technique was
developed using VMAT, but can be equally well applied
to every IMRT-derived technique.
