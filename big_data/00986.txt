Local solution to the G2−monopole equation

with prescribed tangent cone and G2−structure

Yuanqi Wang∗

Given a G2−structure (φ, ψ), on the G2−monopole equation

FA⋆ ∧ψ+⋆φ(dA⋆u) = 0 of a connection A⋆ and a bundle-valued 0−form u, (1)

the following theorem is true.

Theorem 1. Let BO(R) ⊂ R7 be an arbitrary ball centred at the origin.
For any smooth G2−structure (φ, ψ) deﬁned over BO(R), and any smooth
SO(m)−bundle η → S6 equipped with a Hermitian-Yang-Mills connection A0,
there exists a G2−monopole which is deﬁned in a smaller ball and asymptotic
to A0 exponentially at O.

Remark 2. Not every singular elliptic equation admits a local solution. For
example, Brezis-Cabr´e [1] showed that the equation ∆u = − u2+1
|x|2 does not admit
any solution deﬁned near the origin. In contrast, our theorem says that the
singular G2−monopole equation is always locally solvable. In particular, for
any smooth G2−structure deﬁned near O, it yields a G2−monopole tangent to
the canonical connection on S6 (see [2] and [14]). We hope this could help to
construct G2−instantons with point singularities on a closed 7−manifold.

Remark 3. We expect the local solution to be highly non-unique. There exists
a solution whose exponential rate is arbitrarily close to 1 [see (11) and the
discussion below (4)].

The monopole equation in G2−setting ﬁrst appeared in [4] by Donaldson-
Segal. For highly-related later development on G2 or other kinds of monopoles
(instantons), we refer the interested readers to the work done by Sa Earp-
Walpuski [10], Walpuski [12], Oliveira ([6], [7], [8], [9]), Foscolo [5], Charbonneau-
Harland [2], Xu [14], and the references therein.

Proof of Theorem 1: Near O, (φ, ψ) is a small perturbation of [φ(O), ψ(O)].
Using a sophisticated version of the rescaling in page 6-9 of [3], we show in the
following that Theorem 1 is a direct corollary of Theorem 1.13 in [13].

below are centred at O. By Lemma 3.7 in [11], there exists a linear transfor-
mation L such that under the new coordinate y = Lv, φ(O) is the Euclidean
G2−form i.e.

φ(O) = dy123 − dy145 − dy167 − dy246 + dy257 − dy347 − dy356.

(2)

It suﬃces to work under the y−coordinate, under which φ is deﬁned in B(R0)
for some R0 > 0 depending on R and L. We bring in the bundle η as de-
ﬁned over S6(1) (the unit sphere), and then view it as a bundle over R7 \ O
pulled back from the natural spherical projection (Remark 2.3 in [13]). The
connection A0 is pulled-back to be a G2−instanton on R7 \ O with respect to
φ(O).

We write φ = Σijkφijkdyijk. Let Γ denote the map x = Γ(y) = λy from
B( 1
4λ) to B( 1
4). To the x−coordinate, exactly as in the previous paragraph,
we can also pull back the bundles η, adη, and A0 (denoted the same as in
y−coordinate). Since they are objects on S6, they are invariant under Γ. Let

eφ = ΣijkΓ−1,⋆(φijk)dxijk = λ3Γ−1,⋆φ, where φijk is the same as above.

Let cφ denote CΣijk|φijk − φijk(O)|C 5
stant (which could be diﬀerent in various context), and C 5
in y−coordinate. By chain-rule we have for any x that

We actually have a (eφ, eψ)−monopole on B( 1

4) of exponential rate arbitrarily
close to 1. To see this, for any 1 > θ > 0, choose p ∈ (− 5
2) such that the
condition in Deﬁnition 2.21 of [13] is satisﬁed. Let δ0 be small enough with
respect to A0 and p, Theorem 1.13 in [13] (and the rate of convergence given
by the proof of it) is directly applicable. Therefore, let λ be large enough such
that cφ

Moreover, let δ0 be even smaller if necessary, by the proof of Theorem 1.13
in section 5 of [13] (also see Deﬁnition 2.9 and Theorem 5.1 therein), A is of
exponential rate 1 − θ and order 3 i.e.

|x|l+1|∇l

x(A − A0)|(x) ≤ |x|1−θ, for any integer l ∈ [0, 3],

(6)

where |x| is just the usual norm of x, and ∇x is the ordinary derivative (of the
components of A − A0) under the natural charts as in Deﬁnition 2.10 of [13]
(of course here η → S6 and A0 might be trivialized by more than 2 coordinate
neighbourhoods, but this does not make any diﬀerence).

Pulling back both sides of (5) via Γ, we obtain

FA⋆ ∧ (λ4ψ) + Γ⋆[⋆eg(dAσ)] = 0 over B(

1
4λ

), A⋆ = Γ⋆A.

(7)

Using

Γ⋆[⋆eg(dAσ)] = ⋆Γ⋆egΓ⋆(dAσ), Γ⋆eg = λ2g, and ⋆λ2g = λ5 ⋆g (see Remark 4), (8)

where g is the metric of φ, we obtain

FA⋆ ∧ ψ + ⋆gdA⋆(λσ⋆) = 0, σ⋆ = Γ⋆σ.

(9)

The pair (A⋆, λσ⋆) is the monopole we desire. Since Γ⋆A0 = A0 (as a connec-
tion, see the paragraph above (3)), the estimate (6) means

|y|l+1|∇l

y(A⋆ − A0)|(y) ≤ λ1−θ|y|1−θ,

(10)

where l is as in (6), and ∇y is as under (6) but in y−coordinate. Since A0 is
smooth on S6(1), we directly verify by (10) that

|y|l+1|∇l

A0(A⋆ − A0)|(y) ≤ Cλ1−θ|y|1−θ,

(11)

where C is a constant depending only on A0.

The proof of Theorem 1 is complete.

Remark 4. Under a ﬁxed coordinate basis, for any G2−structure φ, the com-
ponents of the co-associative form ψ and the associated metric g only depend
on the components of φ. Moreover, the dependence is via a composition only
of power functions, fractions, and polynomials in terms of the components of
φ. Thus we directly verify (7) and (8).
