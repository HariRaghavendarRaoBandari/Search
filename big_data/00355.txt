Using a mixed-ligand synthetic scheme, we create a family of quasi-two-dimensional antiferromag-
nets, namely, [Cu(HF2)(pyz)2]ClO4 [pyz = pyrazine], [CuL2(pyz)2](ClO4)2 [L = pyO = pyridine-
N-oxide and 4-phpyO = 4-phenylpyridine-N-oxide. These materials are shown to possess equivalent
two-dimensional [Cu(pyz)2]2+ nearly square layers, but exhibit interlayer spacings that vary from
6.5713 ˚A to 16.777 ˚A, as dictated by the axial ligands. We present the structural and magnetic
properties of this family as determined via x-ray diﬀraction, electron-spin resonance, pulsed- and
quasistatic-ﬁeld magnetometry and muon-spin rotation, and compare them to those of the proto-
typical two-dimensional magnetic polymer Cu(pyz)2(ClO4)2. We ﬁnd that, within the limits of the
experimental error, the two-dimensional, intralayer exchange coupling in our family of materials
remains largely unaﬀected by the axial ligand substitution, while the observed magnetic ordering
temperature (1.91 K for the material with the HF2 axial ligand, 1.70 K for the pyO and 1.63 K
for the 4-phpyO) decreases slowly with increasing layer separation. Despite the structural motifs
common to this family and Cu(pyz)2(ClO4)2, the latter has signiﬁcantly stronger two-dimensional
exchange interactions and hence a higher ordering temperature. We discuss these results, as well
as the mechanisms that might drive the long-range order in these materials, in terms of departures
from the ideal S = 1/2 two-dimensional square-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. In particular,
we ﬁnd that both spin exchange anisotropy in the intralayer interaction and interlayer couplings
(exchange, dipolar, or both) are needed to account for the observed ordering temperatures, with the
intralayer anisotropy becoming more important as the layers are pulled further apart.

INTRODUCTION

of a variety of ordered states10.

As a quintessentially quantum-mechanical model and
because of
its relevance to the unsolved problem of
high-temperature superconductivity, the S = 1/2 two-
dimensional (2D) square-lattice Heisenberg antiferro-
magnet (SLHAFM) remains one of the most actively
studied systems in condensed matter physics1–5.
It is
described by the Hamiltonian JΣijSi · Sj (where J is
the strength of the nearest-neighbor exchange interac-
tion) and, because of strong thermal and quantum ﬂuc-
tuations, is resistant to long-range order for temperatures
T > 0 K [6]. Considerable theoretical attention has been
paid to additions to this ideal model, including exter-
nal magnetic ﬁelds, next-nearest-neighbor coupling, or
departures from isotropy in the interactions. Predicted
consequences of such deviations include alterations to the
excitation spectra7, changes in the universality class8, the
emergence of exotic magnetic phases9, and the promotion

Practical realizations of the SLHAFM involve crys-
talline materials that are inevitably three dimensional
from a structural standpoint11; this introduces possible
interlayer magnetic coupling between adjacent square-
lattice planes, which,
if present, will raise the mag-
netic ordering temperature to non-zero values and, po-
tentially, obscure the eﬀects of the other perturbations11.
Reducing the interlayer coupling may allow the above
eﬀects to come to the fore, permitting the associated
theoretical predictions to be investigated in the labo-
ratory.
In this context, the closest experimental ap-
proximations to ideal 2D magnets have typically made
use of copper-oxygen superexchange bonds12. However,
crystal-engineering eﬀorts have given rise to a number
of reduced-dimensionality molecular candidates13–15 in
which the interlayer coupling is reduced to levels seen in
the best inorganic materials. In this way it has been pos-
sible to show evidence of changes in universality class as

a function of magnetic ﬁeld in a molecular SLHAFM16,17.
An added advantage of molecular systems is the ability
to make controlled adjustments to the crystal structure,
thereby tuning interaction strengths and better testing
the predictions of the SLHAFM and associated models.
To this end, we and others have previously shown that
it is possible to gain a degree of control over the primary
exchange energy in low-dimensional molecular antiferro-
magnets via constitutional changes that include deuter-
ation18, anion substitution11,19, exchange of halide lig-
ands20,21, and the application of high pressures22,23.

In this paper, we examine a family of materials based
on 2D arrays of magnetic Cu(II) ions linked by pyrazine
(C4H4N2) ligands in order to investigate the eﬀects of
tuning the interlayer coupling strength. By varying the
layer separation through the interchange of axial ligands,
we study to what extent the antiferromagnetic ordering
temperature can be manipulated, and whether it is possi-
ble to approach the ideal 2D limit. The four coordination
polymers chosen are:

(1) [Cu(HF2)(pyz)2]ClO4,
(2) [Cu(pyO)2(pyz)2](ClO4)2,
(3) [Cu(4-phpyO)2(pyz)2](ClO4)2, and
(4) Cu(pyz)2(ClO4)2.

pyO = pyridine-N -oxide
Here pyz = pyrazine,
(C5H5NO), and 4-phpyO = 4-phenyl-pyridine-N -oxide
(C11H9NO). These materials have interlayer spacings
that range from 6.5713 to 16.777 ˚A at low tempera-
tures. 4 is the prototypical example of a molecular SL-
HAFM12,19,24 and is used here as a yardstick by which
to judge the other compounds.

This paper is organized as follows. After outlining
the synthesis procedures, experimental details and cal-
culations in the next two sections, we describe the crys-
tal structure of the materials as determined using x-ray
diﬀraction. Next we present the results of electron spin-
resonance and pulsed-ﬁeld magnetization experiments to
determine the anisotropic g-factors and eﬀective nearest-
neighbor exchange energies, respectively. We describe
how the exchange energies compare with those found
from previous measurements on structurally related ma-
terials and examine possible reasons for their variation
across the family using density-functional theory. Then
we present the determination of the magnetic ordering
temperatures from muon-spin rotation measurements,
followed by a discussion of the nature of the magnetic
interactions between the layers, as well as the mecha-
nism that drives these systems to long-range order at
low temperatures.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

A. Sample synthesis

All chemical reagents were obtained from commercial
sources and used as received. Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O served
as the Cu(II) source in all syntheses. For 1, Cu(II) ions

2

were slowly mixed with an aqueous solution containing
stoichiometric amounts of NH4HF2 (0.0627 g, 1.10 mmol)
and pyrazine (0.1762 g, 2.20 mmol) to aﬀord a blue so-
lution. For 2 and 3, an aqueous solution of Cu(II) was
combined with an ethanolic solution containing a mix-
ture of pyrazine (0.500 g, 2.11 mmol) and pyridine-N-
oxide (0.401 g, 4.20 mmol) or 4-phenylpyridine-N-oxide
(0.7190 g, 4.20 mmol). Compound 4 was synthesized
as described in the literature19. Deep-blue (1 and 4) or
blue-green (2 and 3) solutions were obtained and, when
allowed to slowly evaporate at room temperature, x-ray
quality blue plates (1 and 4) or dark green plates (2)
∼ 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.2 mm3 were recovered, whereas 3 yielded
dark green microcrystals ∼ 0.03 × 0.03 × 0.01 mm3. The
relative amounts of pyz:pyO (2) or pyz:4-phpyO (3) were
optimized in order to prevent formation of byproducts
such as Cu(ClO4)2(pyz)2, [Cu(pyO)6](ClO4)2, or [Cu(4-
phpyO)6](ClO4)2.

B. X-ray diﬀraction studies

Crystals of each compound except [Cu(pyz)2(4-phpy-
O)2](ClO4)2 were carefully selected, attached to a glass
ﬁber and data collected at several temperatures between
100 and 297 K using a Bruker APEX II CCD X-ray
diﬀractometer (Mo-Kα radiation, λ = 0.071073 nm)
equipped with a low-temperature device. Measurements
employed omega scans and a full sphere of data was col-
lected. Cell parameters were retrieved using SMART
software25, and data were reﬁned using SAINTPlus26
based on all observed reﬂections. Data reduction and
correction for Lorentz polarization and decay were per-
formed using the SAINTPlus software. Absorption cor-
rections were applied using SADABS27. Structures were
solved directly and reﬁned by the least-squares method
on F2 using the SHELXTL program package28. All non-
hydrogen atoms were reﬁned anisotropically. No decom-
position was observed during data collection.

High-resolution synchrotron X-ray powder diﬀrac-
tion patterns were
collected on [Cu(pyz)2(4-phpy-
O)2](ClO4)2 at 297 K using the 11-BM-B beamline lo-
cated at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National
Laboratory. X-rays were selected using a Si(111) chan-
nel cut monochromator. After the sample, the diﬀracted
beams were analyzed using a Ge(111) crystal and de-
tected by a NaI scintillation counter. The wavelength
and diﬀractometer zero were calibrated using a sample of
NIST Standard Reference Material 1976, a sintered plate
of Al2O3. The sample was loaded into a 1.0 mm diam-
eter Kapton tube and mounted in a sample automation
robot. Data were collected for approximately 1 hour. To
improve particle statistics, the capillary was spun at sev-
eral radians per second. Results of the data reﬁnement
for all four materials are given in Table I below.

C. Electron-spin resonance

Electron-spin resonance spectra were measured on
single-crystal samples of 1 and 2, and ﬁne powders of
3 and 4 in the frequency range 10 to 110 GHz using cav-
ity perturbation techniques. For single-crystal g-factor
anisotropy measurements, a monomoded cavity, resonat-
ing at a frequency of around 71 GHz and mounted on
a cryogenic goniometer was employed29. This allows the
crystal to be rotated with respect to the applied mag-
netic ﬁeld without thermal cycling. For powder sam-
ples, and to examine the frequency-ﬁeld scaling for single
crystals, over-moded cylindrical and confocal resonators
were used. Temperature control was provided by a stan-
dard 4He ﬂow cryostat and/or a single shot 3He refrig-
erator. Quasistatic magnetic ﬁelds were applied using a
17 T superconductive solenoid; a Millimetre-wave Vec-
tor Network Analyzer (MVNA), manufactured by AB-
Millimetre, was used as both the microwave source and
detector29.

D. Magnetometry

Pulsed-ﬁeld magnetization measurements were per-
formed at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory
in Los Alamos; ﬁelds of up to 65 T with typical rise
times ≈ 10 ms were used. Single crystals are mounted
in 1.3 mm diameter PCTFE ampoules (inner diameter
1.0 mm) that can be moved into and out of a 1500-turn,
1.5 mm bore, 1.5 mm long compensated-coil susceptome-
ter, constructed from 50 gauge high-purity copper wire11.
When the sample is within the coil and the ﬁeld pulsed
the voltage induced in the coil is proportional to the rate
of change of magnetization with time, (dM/dt). Accu-
rate values of the magnetization are obtained by numeri-
cal integration of the signal with respect to time, followed
by subtraction of the integrated signal recorded using an
empty coil under the same conditions11. The magnetic
ﬁeld is measured via the signal induced within a coaxial
10-turn coil and calibrated via observation of de Haas–
van Alphen oscillations arising from the copper coils of
the susceptometer11. The susceptometer is placed inside
a 3He cryostat, which can attain temperatures as low as
500 mK. During each experiment, the size and sign of
dH/dt of the ﬁeld pulses was varied. No evidence of a
hysteresis caused by slow relaxation of the sample mo-
ment was observed in any of measurements.
Low-ﬁeld magnetization at temperatures ≈ 500 mK
was measured using an iQuantum low-temperature in-
sert for the Quantum Design Magnetic Property Mea-
surement System (MPMS) XL SQUID magnetometer.
Zero-ﬁeld cooled magnetic-moment measurements in the
ﬁeld range 0 ≤ µ0H ≤ 0.3 T were performed on 76.007,
47.326 and 28.717 mg polycrystalline samples of 1, 2 and
3, respectively. To make the measurements, the sam-
ple is placed inside a polycarbonate capsule with a small
amount of cotton wool to prevent it from moving. The

3

capsule is wrapped in a thermally conducting sheath,
containing copper wires arranged parallel to the mag-
netic ﬁeld, and ﬁxed inside a plastic drinking straw. The
temperature is monitored via a thermometer positioned
approximately 1 cm above the sample inside the straw.
The straw is then mounted to the end of a rod which is
lowered into the 3He cryostat. With the 4He chamber
of the MPMS cooled to 1.6 K, the cryostat is evacuated
and liquid 3He is allowed to condense inside, such that
the sample is submerged. Temperatures down to 500 mK
are achieved by combined use of a turbo molecular pump
and a charcoal sorption pump.

E. Muon-spin rotation

Zero-ﬁeld muon-spin rotation measurements were per-
formed on powder samples of 2 and 3. Sample 2 was cov-
ered by a 25 µm silver foil and mounted on the cold ﬁn-
ger of the dilution refrigerator on the LTF instrument at
the Swiss Muon Source, Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzer-
land. Sample 3 was covered by a 12.5 µm silver foil and
mounted in a 3He cryostat on the ARGUS instrument at
the ISIS facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK.
Further details of muon-spin rotation experiments on 1
and 4 can be found in References 12 and 14, respectively.

III. CALCULATIONS

A. Density functional theory

The broken-symmetry approach of Noodleman30 as
implemented in the ORCA version 2.8 suite of pro-
grams31–33 was employed to evaluate the exchange cou-
plings. The quoted coupling constants are based on for-
malism of Yamaguchi, which employs calculated expecta-
tion values (cid:104)S2(cid:105) for both high-spin and broken-symmetry
states34,35. Calculations employed the PBE0 functional,
which has previously been demonstrated to yield reliable
values for magnetic couplings in analogous systems21,36.
The Ahlrichs-VTZ basis function set was used37. For
compound 3, SCF convergence was facilitated by using
a non-standard value (10) for the DIISMaxEq parameter
in ORCA.

B. Dipole-ﬁeld calculations

The dipolar interaction of a spin with magnetic mo-
ment m0 at position r0 with the magnetic moment mi
(assumed to be completely localized) of ion i at position
ri is given by

The dipolar tensor is evaluated for the bulk crystal
inside a Lorentz sphere of radius rL = 100 ˚A. The
results are well converged due to the relatively short-
range nature of the dipolar interaction. The interlayer
dipolar interaction was estimated by calculating the in-
tralayer dipolar interaction inside a Lorentz circle of ra-
dius rL = 100 ˚A and subtracting the result from the bulk
3D dipolar interaction. The dipolar energy of a chosen
moment m0 is then given by

variation in the room temperature structure on moving
across this family is in the tilt angle of the pyrazines. For
the materials with octahedral anions, this angle is close to
90◦, but is signiﬁcantly smaller for the tetrahedral-anion
materials11. More diﬀerences appear on cooling. In con-
−

measured at 15 K indicates that this system remains in
a tetragonal space group down to low-temperatures, has
a single pyrazine tilt angle of 79.2◦, and does not exhibit
the twisting of the N··· N pyrazine axis mentioned above.
In addition, as discussed in more detail below, there is
a reduction of nearly a factor of two in the primary ex-
change constant in this family associated with the change
from octahedral to tetrahedral anions11.

IV. CRYSTAL STRUCTURES

The low-temperature crystal structures of all four com-
pounds viewed along the copper-pyrazine planes are
shown in Figure 1; complete data sets are available at
the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC)38.
Table I collects the lattice parameters at both high and
low temperatures, while Table II oﬀers a comparison of
some low-temperature structural parameters relevant to
the discussion of the magnetic properties.

[Cu(HF2)(pyz)2]ClO4 (1) crystallizes at room temper-
ature in the tetragonal space group P 4/nmm, with each
copper(II) ion equatorially ligated to four pyrazine nitro-
gen atoms at a distance of 2.039(3) ˚A and axially ligated
−
2 at a distance of 2.228(3) ˚A.
to the ﬂuorines from HF
This coordination gives rise to square-lattice copper-
pyrazine layers separated by strong hydrogen-bonded
−
2 pillars. Intralayer and interlayer copper separations
HF
are 6.863(1) ˚A and 6.689(1) ˚A, respectively, with the
−
non-coordinated ClO
4 counterions located close to the
centre of these copper-cornered cuboids. The pyrazine
molecule is tilted 64.2◦ out of the copper-pyrazine planes
and counter-rotates relative to its closest neighbor within
the plane. This room-temperature structure has been re-
ported previously11. On cooling to 50 K the structure
transforms into the triclinic space group P ¯1. The Cu–
N bond lengths are no longer equal, varying between
2.064(5) and 2.089 ˚A. This leads to a slight departure
from perfect copper-pyrazine square planes, the short-
est in-plane Cu··· Cu distance being 6.824(1) ˚A and the

[Cu(pyO)2(pyz)2](ClO4)2 (2) adopts the monoclinic
C2/m space group with no change on cooling to 100 K.
There is a similar equatorial ligand arrangement in the
low-temperature phase of 1, with Cu–N distances rang-
ing from 2.023(3) to 2.040(4) ˚A at low temperatures and
copper-pyrazine plaquettes that deviate slightly from a
square arrangement. Each copper(II) site is also coordi-
nated to two oxygens from the axially-ligated pyridine-N-
oxide molecules at a distance of 2.331(3) ˚A and the bond
angles within the CuN4O2 octahedra that deviate from
90◦ by up to 2.6◦. Adjacent copper-pyrazine planes are
shifted with respect to one another along the a-axis, leav-
ing each copper close to equidistant from its two nearest
neighbors within each adjacent plane. This staggering of
layers could give rise to a degree of frustration if any an-
tiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling is present,
and in principle cause complete cancellation if the copper
ions were arranged in a triangular lattice in the interlayer
direction. In reality there is a diﬀerence in the interlayer
Cu–Cu distances, as shown in Table II. As compared to 1,
−
2 has twice as many ClO
4 anions per formula unit, with
the chlorine ion approximately centrally located above
and below the copper-pyrazine plaquettes at alternating
distances of 3.0 and 3.5 ˚A.

[Cu(4-phpyO)2(pyz)2](ClO4)2 (3) also has a mono-
clinic structure, crystallizing in the C2/m space group.
The axial ligand in this material is the larger 4-phenyl-
pyridine-N-oxide molecule. The ligand and anion ar-
rangements are akin to that of 2 with departures from
the ideal square lattice in the copper-pyrazine planes and

FIG. 1. (color online). Experimentally determined crystal structures viewed along the copper-pyrazine planes. All structures
shown were determined via single-crystal x-ray diﬀraction at 100 K, except for 1 for which both 300 K and 50 K structures are
presented. Here pyz = pyrazine, pyO = pyridine-N-oxide, 4-phpyO = 4-phenyl-pyridine-N-oxide; as shown in the inset key, Cu
= brown, Cl = green, C = gray, N = blue, H = cyan, O = red, and F = light green. All hydrogens from organic molecules are
omitted for clarity. The blue-dashed lines denote a single unit cell. All four systems are based on two-dimensional arrays of
Cu-pyz in which pyz orbitals mediate the dominant exchange interactions. In 1 the triclinic structure is supported by strong
F··· H··· F hydrogen bonds that form bridging ligands separating the layers11. The three other systems have non-bridging
ligands along the interlayer direction and a monoclinic structure. The non-bridging ligands in 2 and 3 are pyO and 4-phpyO
respectively. Whilst the ClO4 molecules are non-coordinating anions in 1, 2 and 3, they coordinate to the Cu-ions in 4.

a similar range of bond angles within the CuN4O2 octa-
hedra. Again there are two non-coordinated counterions
per formula unit, the chlorines here lying at a distance
of approximately 3.5 ˚A either side of the copper-pyrazine
planes.

ligands order such that the chlorines are a perpendic-
ular distance of 3.7 ˚A away from the planes to which
their molecules coordinate and sit in the space above the
copper-pyrazine squares of the adjacent plane at a dis-
tance of 3.2 ˚A.

The structure of Cu(pyz)2(ClO4)2 (4) has been re-
ported by Darriet et al.24 and more recently by Wood-
ward et al.19. The structure resulting from our x-ray
diﬀraction study is shown in Figure 1 and is in agreement
with the previous measurements. At room temperature
the crystal adopts the monoclinic C2/m space group with
doubly-staggered square-lattice copper-pyrazine planes
and a single pyrazine tilt angle of 65.8◦. Below about
180 K a phase change to the C2/c space group occurs.
The square layers remain, but there are now two tilt an-
gles, 63.0◦ and 69.9◦, one for each cis-coordinated lig-
and pair19. The tilt angles do not counter-rotate within
the copper-pyrazine planes. Unlike compounds 1, 2 and
−
3, the ClO
4 ions are coordinated to the coppers via an
oxygen. At temperatures below the phase change, these

Thus, by changes in the axial coordination of these
four materials, a family is realized in which the copper-
pyrazine planes are largely maintained while the inter-
layer structure is signiﬁcantly altered.
In particular,
the spacing between adjacent layers at low tempera-
tures varies from 6.5713(1) ˚A, through 12.267(2) ˚A, to
16.777(9) ˚A for the systems with the HF2 (1), pyO
(2) and 4-phpyO (3) ligands, respectively. System 4,
with the ClO4 axial ligands, has an interlayer spacing of
6.913(1) ˚A.

TABLE II. Crystallographic parameters of interest for magnetism, measured at 100 K, except for 1 for which the data were
taken at 50 K. Cu–N represents the equatorial coordination bond length and Cu–L is the axial coordination bond length, i.e.
Cu–F for 1 and Cu–O otherwise. In all cases the Jahn-Teller axis lies along the axial ligand direction. Intralayer Cu-Cu are
the Cu–pyz–Cu distances within the planes. Interlayer Cu-Cu are the shortest interlayer neighbor distances; where more than
one value is quoted it is because they are closely spaced due to staggering of adjacent planes. The interlayer spacings are the
perpendicular distances between planes. The tilt angle is that between the plane of the pyrazine molecules and the copper-
pyrazine layers. The twist angle is that between the N··· N axis of the pyrazine molecules and the copper-copper pathways
in the two-dimensional planes. The last line shows data measured at 15 K for the related material [Cu(HF2)(pyz)2]SbF6 [11],
which is compared to 1-4 in later discussions.

V. SINGLE-ION PROPERTIES

In all four materials the Jahn-Teller-active copper(II)
ion sits at the center of a distorted CuN4L2 octahe-
dron, where L is the axially-coordinated ion, namely F
in compound 1, and O in the other compounds. As
shown in Table II, in each case the Cu–L bond length
is elongated compared to the intralayer Cu–N coordi-
nation bond lengths, an indication that the Jahn-Teller
axis points out of the copper-pyrazine planes39. For
S = 1/2 copper in a such an environment, the crystal
ﬁeld splits the 3d states such that the dx2−y2 orbital is
partially occupied and aligned perpendicular to the ax-
ial distortion39. The greater overlap of dx2−y2 with the

dxy orbital, than with dxz or dyz, leads to a greater en-
hancement of the g-factor for ﬁelds along z (the axial
direction) than for those in the xy plane40. Similarly,
through the spin-orbit interaction, the exchange coupling
between neighboring spins will likely also possesses spin
anisotropy39. This spin exchange anisotropy (as opposed
to the spatial exchange anisotropy dictating the dimen-
sionality of the magnetism) is a two-ion anisotropy, which
leads to easy-plane or easy-axis deviations from Heisen-
berg (spin isotropic) antiferromagnetic order. As dis-
cussed later, the family of quasi-two-dimensional 3d9 cop-
per systems considered here exhibits small levels of spin
anisotropy, and which are likely, at least in part, respon-
sible for the long-range order observed in these materials.
For a spin-half system in the absence of interactions be-

tween the spins, the electron-spin resonance (ESR) con-
dition (the frequency-ﬁeld relationship for the ESR line)
is a measure of the spectroscopic g-factor41,42. The ESR
condition in the antiferromagnetic state is determined
by both the applied magnetic ﬁeld and the eﬀective in-
ternal exchange ﬁeld43,44. This has the largest eﬀect on
the frequency-ﬁeld scaling, and hence the determination
of the g-factor, for magnetic ﬁelds applied perpendicu-
lar to the easy plane.
In this case the frequency-ﬁeld
relationship is no longer linear; the applied and inter-
nal ﬁelds add in quadrature giving rise to a ﬁnite fre-
quency intercept for the resonance condition at zero ap-
plied ﬁeld42. For conventional three-dimensional antifer-
romagnets the crossover from paramagnetic resonance to
antiferromagnetic resonance (with ﬁnite zero-ﬁeld inter-
cept) occurs close to the magnetic ordering temperature,
41. By contrast, in antiferromagnets of reduced dimen-
Tc
sionality (in which Tc is signiﬁcantly suppressed relative
to the energy scale of the dominant exchange interaction)
a non-linear frequency-ﬁeld relationship can become ev-
ident at temperatures signiﬁcantly above those at which
long-range order is observed (at T (cid:39) 2Tc)42,43. Conse-
quently, the ESR spectra of reduced-dimensional mag-
netic materials must be interpreted with caution. To
obtain the most accurate measure of the paramagnetic g-
factor anisotropy, conditions under which the frequency-
ﬁeld relationship becomes strongly nonlinear should be
avoided. In practice, this means not employing temper-
atures or frequencies that are low relative to the energy
scales of the exchange anisotropy. Therefore, where pos-
sible, for the purpose of this paper, we have derived the
spectroscopic g-factor from the gradient of linear ﬁts to
measurements at multiple high ((cid:29) 10 GHz) frequencies
at temperatures of at least twice Tc. We have also inves-
tigated the temperature dependence to verify minimal
inﬂuence of the antiferromagnetic order.

Figure 2 contains examples of ESR measurements on
the four materials studied in this paper. Figure 2(a)
shows the powder spectra of 4 measured at a frequency
of 71 GHz, while (b) shows similar spectra for 3 mea-
sured at a frequency of 70.3 GHz. For the latter, a
smaller ﬁeld range is shown to emphasize the small shift
of the hard axis ESR line in the vicinity of antiferro-
magnetic order at 2 K. At temperatures above 10 K the
observed asymmetric ESR lines in both cases are con-
sistent with a uniaxial g-factor anisotropy corresponding
to gz = 2.25(5) and gxy = 2.04(3). Note, these are the
g-factors obtained with the measurement ﬁeld applied
perpendicular and parallel to the Cu–pyz planes respec-
tively. At a temperature of 2 K the ESR contribution
from magnetic ﬁelds oriented along the easy axis (gz) are
signiﬁcantly broadened, in agreement with single-crystal
measurements from other members of this family at tem-
peratures approaching that of antiferromagnetic order.
Figure 2(c) shows the angle-dependence of the measured
g-factor in single crystals of 2 as ﬁeld is rotated between
perpendicular to (0◦) and parallel to (90◦) the Cu–pyz
planes. Again the g−factor anisotropy is gz = 2.25(5)

and gxy = 2.04(3). Figure 2(d) shows the frequency –
magnetic ﬁeld scaling of the ESR line measured on a
single crystal of 1 with the ﬁeld oriented perpendicu-
lar to the planes. At a temperature of 10 K the lin-
ear frequency-ﬁeld scaling (with the 0,0 intercept) corre-
sponds to a g-factor of 2.26(2). The non-linear frequency-
ﬁeld scaling observed at a temperature of 1.5 K (which is

below the ordering temperature of 1.91 K) is well repro-
duced by adding a zero magnetic-ﬁeld frequency oﬀset
(23 GHz) to the linear frequency-ﬁeld scaling (given by
the g-factor evolution at high temperatures) in quadra-
ture. The frequency-ﬁeld scaling is consistent with evolu-
tion to antiferromagnetic resonance at low temperature
indicating an XY -type spin exchange anisotropy of a few
percent43,44.

The g-factors deduced from all of the ESR experi-
ments on compounds 1 to 4 are reproduced in Table III;
to within experimental errors, all compounds exibit the
same range of g-factors associated with anisotropy due to
crystal-ﬁeld eﬀects45. The material-independence of the
g-factor values shows that the microscopic environment
of the Cu ions is very similar in all four compounds, as
already suggested by the structural data discussed in the
previous section.

INTRALAYER MAGNETIC EXCHANGE

ENERGIES

A. Pulsed magnetic ﬁeld measurements

Figure 3 shows the magnetization of the four com-
pounds measured in pulsed magnetic ﬁelds at temper-
atures close to 0.60 K. Pulsed-ﬁeld data have been pre-
viously reported for 1, 2 [11] and 4 [46]. Apart from a
low-ﬁeld hump seen in 3, possibly due to a small concen-
tration of paramagnetic impurities, the form of the low-
temperature magnetization in all cases is very similar: a
gradual concave rise to the saturation ﬁeld Hc. This gen-
eral shape is typical of the S = 1/2 SLHAFM with ﬁnite
interlayer couplings11 as described by the Hamiltonian

where J represents the strength of the eﬀective nearest-
neighbor exchange energy within the planes and J⊥ the
magnetic coupling between the planes11. The ﬁrst and
second terms describe summations over unique pairs
of nearest neighbors parallel and perpendicular to the
planes, respectively, and the last term is the Zeeman en-
ergy associated with a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B. In par-
ticular, previously reported quantum-Monte-Carlo simu-
lations indicate that data such as those in Figure 3 are
characteristic of systems for which the spatial exchange
anisotropy J⊥/J (cid:28) 1 and that the curvature of the mag-
netization increases as this ratio decreases11. This con-
cave M (H) curve is a result of the eﬀect of quantum ﬂuc-
tuations on these low-spin systems, which act to reduce
the moment at a particular ﬁeld from its classical value.
If the exchange anisotropy were to be reduced and/or
the size of the spin quantum number increased the mag-
netization will approach its classical linear form11.
In
Ref. 11, the diﬀerence in saturation ﬁelds in single-crystal
measurements along diﬀerent crystallographic axes is at-
tributed to the anisotropy of the g-factor. This is also the
case for the data shown in Figures 3(a) and (b): satura-
tion along diﬀerent crystallographic directions in a par-
ticular material occurs at the same value of the Zeeman
energy once the measured, anisotropic g values have been
included. At the saturation ﬁeld, Equation 4 reduces to

gµBBc = nJ + n⊥J⊥

(5)

where Bc = µ0Hc, and for each S = 1/2 spin, n is the
number of nearest neighbors within the planes and n⊥ is
the number perpendicular to the planes.

For highly anisotropic, square-lattice systems, n = 4
and the ﬁnal term is small enough to be neglected, al-
lowing the size of the intralayer exchange energy to be
deduced from a measurement of Bc. The saturation ﬁelds
of three of the compounds shown in Figure 3 are similar;
20.2(2) T (1), 21.9(2) T (2) and 21.1(2) T (3).
[Note
these values in each case represent a polycrystalline av-
erage: Bc = (Bz
c )/3.] Using the above relation

c + 2Bxy

and the relevant g-factors from the ESR experiments we
ﬁnd that J = 7.2(2) K (1), 7.7(2) K (2) and 7.5(2) K
(3). These values are tabulated in Table III.

The size of J for 1 is comparable to that of
[Cu(HF2)(pyz)2]X with X = BF4, but smaller by nearly
a factor of two than the members of the same family
11.
with octahedral counterions X = PF6, SbF6 and AsF6
In contrast, changing the symmetry of the counterion
in the [Cu(pyO)2(pyz)2](X)2 family does not appear to
have such a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the exchange energy:
the X = PF6 material has J = 8.1(3) K47, only slightly
larger that found for 2.

The similarity in J between compounds 1, 2 and 3 is
not unexpected, given their comparable copper-pyrazine
square-lattice conﬁgurations. What is more surprising
is that, as shown in Figure 3(c), 4 requires the appli-
cation of a much bigger ﬁeld (Bc = 51.1(2) T) to fully
align the spins, yielding a eﬀective exchange energy of
J = 18.1(4) K, which is in reasonable agreement with
previous estimates19,46. The square-lattice network in 4
is not unlike those in the other compounds; why, then,
should this exchange energy be so diﬀerent? One major
structural diﬀerence between 4 and the other materials
considered here is that in the former the ClO4 molecules
are coordinated to the copper-ions rather than adopt-
ing non-coordinated positions centrally above the square
copper-pyrazine plaquettes. Although the ClO4 ligands
in 4 do indeed sit in near-central locations on either side
of the squares of the neighboring planes, this contrast in
the way the molecule is bonded will likely lead to a dif-
ference in the distribution of electron density close to the
layers for this compound as compared to the other three.
reduction in J ob-
served on changing the counterion symmetry in the
[Cu(HF2)(pyz)2]X family from octahedral to tetrahe-
dral is accompanied by a change in the tilt angle of
the pyrazines, which could also act to redistribute elec-
tron density. Pyrazine tilting has been correlated with
changes in J in copper-pyrazine square-lattice materials
on several occasions11,14,24, but a causal relationship has
not been established. However, in the context of the
current paper, the X-ray measurements discussed above
showed that the pyrazine tilt angles are similar for all
four of the compounds that are the focus of this paper.

B. Density-functional-theory calculations

The nature of the super-exchange interactions in this
class of material has been the subject of attention in the
past, with early experimental and theoretical studies at
odds as to the relevant importance of the σ-orbitals49
over the pyrazine π-orbitals24,50. More recent theoret-
ical studies have made use of density-functional theory
(DFT) and, in particular, compound 4 has been investi-
gated using ﬁrst-principles calculations by Vela et al.51.
According to their calculations a disparity of about 30%
(21.0 K vs 29.6 K) is present at 15 K between the ex-

9

change strengths through the two crystallographically
distinct pyrazine molecules in this material52. By con-
trast, using the 165 K structure their calculations show
only a very small diﬀerence in these exchange energies.
Vela et al.51 rule out the tilting of the pyrazines as a
contributory factor in the low-temperature disparity and
instead attribute it to a combination of three eﬀects,
which are, in increasing order of importance: (i) hydro-
gen bonding between the O atoms of the perchlorates
and the H atoms of the pyrazines; (ii) a shear-like dis-
tortion of the pyrazine rings; and (iii) the orientation of
−
4 ligands. The authors of Ref. 51 suggest that
the ClO
−
the role of ClO
4 molecules is to increase the spin-density
along the primary exchange pathway leading to an en-
hanced interaction strength. By extension, for the other
−
4 counterions oc-
samples considered here, where the ClO
cupy voids between the layers, this enhancement is not
expected to occur, which could explain the large disparity
in the in-plane exchange energies.

We have performed DFT studies on all four of the com-
pounds using the low-temperature structures shown in
Figure 1. In each case, two distinct exchange strengths
were identiﬁed along the Cu-pyrazine linkages within the
unit cell. These are found to be 4.3 and 10.2 K (1), 4.7
and 8.1 K (2), 14.5 and 17.0 K (3), and 22.8 and 21.3 K
(4). We note that the disparity in the two exchange
strengths for 4 is smaller than that found in Ref.51. This
is probably because the authors of that work used a 10 K,
rather than a 100 K, structure; the disparity develops on
cooling.
If the predictions are correct it would imply
that these materials correspond to a rectangular rather
than a square-lattice model. It is not presently possible
to experimentally verify such disparities in the exchange
parameters from temperature-dependent magnetic sus-
ceptibility data owing a lack of analytical ﬁtting expres-
sions that can adequately discriminate between square
and rectangular models of antiferromagnetism. We can,
however, compare the theoretical results with the ex-
change energies listed in Table III, obtained by applying
the SLHAFM model to the low-temperature pulsed-ﬁeld
magnetization measurements, by calculating an average
or eﬀective intralayer exchange strength from the DFT
calculations. These are 7.3 K (1), 6.4 K (2), 15.8 K (3),
and 22.1 K (4). The correspondence between experiment
and calculation is good for 1 and 4, reasonable for 2, but
poor for 3. The disappointing result for 3 may be a con-
sequence of the diﬃculties of treating the 3d-4s mixing in
the perchlorate ligand, which is a relatively poor donor39.

C. Next nearest-neighbor interactions

Finally in this section, we point out that other ex-
change pathways in the Cu–pyz planes are also possi-
ble. A recent neutron-scattering study of 453 analysed
the intralayer spin-wave spectrum in this material using
the isotropic J1 − J2 model, which has two intralayer
exchange terms in the Hamiltonian:

surements performed at 24 K (1), 20 K(2), 28 K (3), and 19 K (4). µ0Hc and J are, respectively, the powder-averaged
saturation magnetic ﬁeld and the eﬀective nearest-neighbor exchange energy deduced from pulsed-ﬁeld-magnetization measure-
ments performed at 600 mK. The antiferromagnetic ordering temperature (Tc) is established via muon-spin relaxation studies.
The Tc/J ratios are used to estimate the upper bounds of the interplane coupling (J⊥) and spatial exchange anisotropy (|J⊥/J|)
in the Heisenberg model48. Dipole-ﬁeld calculations are used to estimate the energy scale of the interplane dipolar interaction

data at low temperatures. The spin-exchange anisotropy, ∆, is given by the ratio HA/Hc and the anisotropy energy scale is
parameterized by the product of J and ∆.

netic, then they will act to frustrate one another and the
eﬀective nearest-neighbor exchange energy of Equation 4
will be given by J = J1 − J2. Theory predicts that if the
J2 is a signiﬁcant fraction of J1 the ground state of this
model is no longer the simple N`eel state, but transforms
ﬁrst into a disordered spin-liquid phase and, at higher
values of J2, an ordered collinear state9,10,54.

However, data described in the next section show that
all the materials considered here exhibit a relatively
simple phase diagram, with a low-temperature ordered
phase. This is in accord with expectations that J2 is
small due to the lack of an eﬀective exchange pathway
across the diagonal. The authors of Ref.53 estimated
J2 (cid:39) 0.02J1 from their spin-wave data on 4. A later
neutron spectroscopy study55 expanded this analysis to
conclude a small XY anisotropy in J1, which will be dis-
cussed in more detail later.

To summarize this Section, the intralayer exchange
energies in compounds 1-3 are probably chieﬂy deter-
mined by nearest-neighbour interactions via Cu–pyz–Cu
exchange pathways, yielding a dominant J ≈ 7.5 K in
all cases. The almost identical values of the intralayer
exchange energies in these three compounds is in accord
with the earlier sections of the current paper, in which
both the structure of the Cu–pyz planes and the local
crystal-ﬁeld environment of Cu are shown to be very sim-
ilar in 1, 2 and 3.

VII.
INTERACTIONS DETERMINING THE
MAGNETIC ORDERING TEMPERATURES

A. Muon spin-rotation measurements

Reduced-dimensionality magnetic systems accommo-
date short-range spin correlations that begin to build
up at temperatures higher than the transition tempera-
ture, aﬀecting the thermodynamic properties of the sys-
tem43,56. This leads to the observation of a broad max-
imum in both the magnetic susceptibility and the heat
capacity at temperatures of the order of the primary ex-
change energy11. At lower temperatures additional in-
teractions force the system into a state of long-range
order, but the associated entropy change at the order-
ing temperature can be rather small, because the spins
are already highly correlated. The result is that the
feature by which the transition can be identiﬁed is of-
ten masked by the much larger hump resulting from the
spin correlations56. Local probes, such as muon-spin ro-
tation (µ+SR), do not suﬀer from the same drawbacks
as thermodynamic techniques because they are sensitive
to the static, internal magnetic ﬁeld which only devel-
ops once three-dimensional long-range order sets in11,57.
Thus µ+SR can be used to determine the critical tem-
perature in highly anisotropic materials.

In a µ+SR experiment spin-polarized positive muons
are implanted in a target sample, where the muon usually
occupies an interstitial position in the crystal57. In such
an experiment, the time evolution of the muon-spin po-
larization is observed, the behavior of which depends on
the local magnetic ﬁeld at the muon site. Each muon de-
cays, with an average lifetime of 2.2 µs, into two neutrinos
and a positron, the latter particle being emitted preferen-
tially along the instantaneous direction of the muon spin.

where γ is an experimental calibration constant. A(t) is
proportional to the spin polarization of the muon ensem-
ble.

Example spectra are shown in Fig. 4(a). Below a char-
acteristic temperature, oscillations in the asymmetry are
observed in all samples. This is because the local ﬁeld
causes a coherent precession of the spins of those muons
for which a component of their spin polarization lies per-
pendicular to this local ﬁeld57. Thus the observation of
oscillations provides clear evidence for long-range mag-
netic order throughout the bulk of the sample.
For 2 at T ≤ 1.7 K the spectra were ﬁtted to

A(t) = A1e−λ1t cos(2πν1t + φ1) +
A2e−λ2t cos(2πν2t + φ2) +
A3e−λ3t + Ab,

(7)

where the ﬁrst two terms account for muons whose spins
precess coherently in a quasistatic magnetic ﬁeld, the
third term is due to muons that depolarize too rapidly for
oscillations to be observed and the ﬁnal term accounts for
the muon-spin projection parallel to the local magnetic
ﬁeld and muons that stop in the sample holder or cryo-
stat tail57. Non-zero phase angles φi were found to be
necessary; they did not correlate with νi(T ). During the
ﬁtting process we ﬁxed φ1 = −29◦ and φ2 = 40◦. A
zeroth-order Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind (indicative
of spin-density wave order58) was found to give a worse
ﬁt to the experimental spectra. The ratios A1/A2 and
ν2/ν1 were ﬁxed to 0.864 and 0.378, respectively. Close
to the transition it was necessary to also ﬁx A2 = 2.91%
(and thus A1 = 2.51%). The asymmetry spectra for 3 at
T ≤ 1.6 K were ﬁtted to the same functional form but
with Ab = A0 exp(−Γt) instead of a constant. The ﬁts to
the low-temperature spectra for 1 and 4 also use Equa-
tion 7 (with the addition of a third precession frequency
for 4) and have been previously described elsewhere12,14.
The temperature-dependences of the ﬁtted precession
frequencies are shown in Figure 4(b). The oscillation
frequencies represent an eﬀective order parameter57 and

ble IV. The extracted values of the β critical parameter
are typical of reduced-dimensionality magnetic interac-
tions14. The critical temperatures are also tabulated in
Table III, and are seen to decrease slowly across the fam-
ily 1, 2 and 3 as the interlayer separation is increased.
Compound 4 has a signiﬁcantly higher Tc than 1-3, the
reasons for which will be discussed below.

B.

Interlayer exchange interactions

Ideal two-dimensional Heisenberg magnets do not
exhibit long-range order at temperatures above zero
kelvin6. Real systems, however, have additional inter-
actions that act to promote magnetic ordering. In par-
ticular, for the quasi-two-dimensional model described by
Equation 4, a ﬁnite spatial exchange anisotropy (|J⊥/J|)
enhances Tc according to the empirically-derived rela-
tion48

Tc/J = 2.30/(2.43 − ln|J⊥/J|),

(8)

which has been shown to be valid in the absence of
strong quantum-critical ﬂuctuations59,60. The Tc/J ra-
tios for the compounds considered here are shown in
Table III and are seen to be similar across the family,
but with compound 1 having a slightly higher value than
the others. Also shown are the estimates of |J⊥/J| and
|J⊥| obtained by applying the above formula. Accord-
ing to this calculation all four compounds can be consid-
ered to be highly two-dimensional with spatial-exchange
anisotropies ≤ 10−3 (although it should be noted that
this requires extrapolation of Equation 8 somewhat be-
yond the range for which it was originally derived48).
By this estimate 2 and 3 are among the closest approx-
imations to an ideal SLHAFM of any copper-pyrazine
system realised so far, having a spatial exchange ratio
(0.03%) slightly lower than that of the related compound
[Cu(2-pyridone)2(pyz)2](ClO4)2 (0.05%)15, but not as
low as the inorganic SLHAFM Sr2CuO2Cl2 (0.003%)12,
or the S = 1/2 coordination polymer Ag(pyz)2(S2O8)
(0.0002%)13.

The estimated interlayer couplings are similar for 1
and 4, which have comparable interlayer spacings (see
Table II); this implies that the diﬀerence in ordering
temperatures in these two materials arises predominantly
from the variation in their intralayer exchange strength
described in the previous section.
As the layer separation increases by a factor ≈ 2.5
between compounds 1 and 3, there is an accompanying
sevenfold reduction in the interlayer coupling strength.
If we naively attribute the drop in interlayer coupling to
a power-law dependence on interlayer separation (J⊥ ∝
R−p), we ﬁnd that the exponent p (cid:39) 2.1. In several sys-
tems superexchange energies have empirically been found
to vary with interionic spacing with the exponent p ≈ 10
(see e.g.61–63), a result which has been interpreted to be

12

a consequence of the role of σ-bonding in the superex-
change process in these materials64. Magnetic exchange
is contingent on the degree of overlap between neighbor-
ing electronic orbitals and its spatial variation will de-
pend upon the nature of the exchange pathways. Unlike
the Cu compounds that are the subject of this paper,
none of the materials described in Refs. 61–63 involve
exchange mediated through aromatic molecules. There-
fore the exchange interactions may not necessarily be ex-
pected to have the same distance dependence. Neverthe-
less, as the exponent p ≈ 2.1 for compounds 1-3 is much
less than that expected for superexchange (p ≈ 10; see
above), in the following section, we consider other types
of interaction that might be present and that could drive
magnetic order.

The interlayer exchange energies in Table III were de-
rived using the Hamiltonian in Equation 4. Since, as
discussed below, other interactions may contribute to
the magnetic order, the values of the spatial exchange
anisotropy quoted in Table III should be considered as
upper bounds.

C. Dipolar interactions

Given the small energy scales in these molecular sys-
tems, it is important to assess to what extent symmetry-
breaking dipolar interactions contribute to the magnetic
anisotropy and the propensity of the system to undergo
magnetic ordering. This issue provoked early theoreti-
cal attention by Luttinger and Tisza65 as well as more
recent experimental work in a rare-earth system66.
In
principle, long-range order in quasi-2D Heisenberg anti-
ferromagnets can be brought about by the dipolar cou-
plings between the layers. The dipole interaction has a
R−3 distance dependence67–69, which is similar to the es-
timate determined above by comparing the upper bounds
of the interlayer exchange couplings in 1 and 3.

We have performed dipole-ﬁeld calculations given a
certain assumed collinear antiferromagnetic structure in-
spired by the structure suggested for 4 on the basis
of neutron-diﬀraction experiments55. The calculations
leave the direction of each individual moment variable.
and hence allow the dipolar anisotropy to be determined
for the assumed magnetic structure; results are shown in
Table III. The interlayer dipolar coupling E⊥
D decreases
rapidly with interlayer separation and is largest for 1.
For 1 and 4 E⊥
D is found to be similar to the magni-
tude of interlayer coupling necessary to account for the
measured Tc/J ratio, suggesting that dipolar interactions
could play a signiﬁcant role in driving the magnetic or-
dering in these compounds.

We point out that our dipolar calculations assume
an ordered moment size of 1µB. Quantum ﬂuctua-
tions are expected to reduce the moment in reduced-
dimensionality magnets and an ordered moment of
0.62µB is expected for the ideal 2D SLHAFM at zero
temperature5. In such circumstances, the quoted energy

scales of the dipolar interactions must hence be reduced
by a factor of up to 0.38. However, the ordered moment
of Cu(pyz)2(ClO4)2 has been measured to be as low as
0.47(5)µB (see Ref. 53), so the dipolar interactions could
potentially be reduced even further.

D. Spin exchange anisotropy

The preceding analyses attribute the ﬁnite value of Tc
entirely to some kind of coupling between the copper-
pyrazine planes. However, it has been suggested that
the magnetic order in these types of material could be
driven by a combination of interlayer coupling and spin-
exchange anisotropy within the layers (a departure from a
Heisenberg-type interactions)70. The g-factor anisotropy
determined above shows that the spin-orbit coupling that
gives rise to spin-exchange anisotropy is present in the
materials considered here. The Hamiltonian relevant to
these systems is consequently amended to

where we have included both nearest-neighbor (J1) and
next-nearest-neighbor (J2) intralayer interactions, as well
as the interlayer coupling (J⊥). ∆ is the spin-exchange
anisotropy parameter and is expected to be small and
positive (XY -like) for quasi-two-dimensional S = 1/2
Ignoring the J2 and J⊥ terms, quantum-
systems.
Monte-Carlo simulations predict a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-
Thouless-type transition to three-dimensional magnetic
order driven by even very small levels of spin exchange
anisotropy8,71 and obtain Tc/J ratios similar to those
measured here arising from ∆ ∼ 10−2. Reference 70,
again neglecting any eﬀects of J2, found evidence for
spin-exchange anisotropy in low-ﬁeld magnetization and
low-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements
of several quasi-two-dimensional copper-pyrazine poly-
meric magnets, including compound 4. The observation
of a change in slope, or kink, in M (H) obtained with the
ﬁeld applied parallel to the planes allowed the authors
to conclude ∆ = 5 × 10−3 for 4 [72]. Using neutron-
spectroscopy measurements on the aforementioned com-
pound, some of the same authors later determined values
of J2 (cid:39) 0.02J1 = 0.4 K and ∆ = 2×10−3 [55]. ESR74 and
heat capacity16 data were used to estimate ∆ = 3× 10−3
and 7 × 10−3 for the PF
−
6 counterion analogues of 1 and
2, respectively.

Low-ﬁeld magnetization data taken using polycrys-
talline samples of 1, 2 and 3 are shown in Figure 5(a)-(c).
These experiments were performed at 500 mK so that the
sample is in the magnetically ordered state. Figure 5(d)

13

shows similar data for 4 at 1.8 K taken from70. In this
case, a single crystal was used and the magnetic ﬁeld
aligned both parallel and perpendicular to the Cu–pyz
planes. The kink in M (H) arising from the spin-exchange
anisotropy is clearly observed with the parallel-ﬁeld ori-
entation. This kink occurs when the applied in-plane ﬁeld
is increased above the anisotropy ﬁeld, HA [70]. At this
point the moments can begin to rotate out of the easy
plane, leading to an enhancement in the dynamic sus-
ceptibility and hence a kink in the magnetization70. The
equivalent feature in the data for the polycrystalline sam-
ples is reduced in clarity by comparison; nevertheless, a
change in slope is apparent for all compounds. The ﬁelds
at which this kink appears, the anisotropy ﬁeld µ0HA,
are determined from the position of the large peak in
d2M/dH 2 and are found to be 0.08 T (1), 0.11 T (2)
and 0.11 T (3). ∆ can be found by taking the ratio of
HA and Hc [70] and is found to be similar in magnitude
(∼ 10−3) for all members of the family. The size of the
energy scale associated with this anisotropy is estimated
from the product of J and ∆ and these values are tabu-
lated in Table III.

If we assume that the polycrystalline compounds also
exhibit an XY -type anisotropy, we can determine the ef-
fect this has on the magnetic ordering temperature. Fig-
ure 5(e) plots the experimental values of Tc/J against ∆
for the four compounds, as well as some other quasi-2D
copper-based antiferromagnets. Also shown is the func-
tion

(10)

which is empirically determined via quantum-Monte-
Carlo calculations8 and relates the ordering temperature
to ∆, assuming that the nearest-neighbor, anisotropic
intralayer exchange is the only term in the Hamiltonian
(i.e. neglecting J2 and J⊥ in Equation 9). Following
Reference 70, we expect that if an experimental point
lies on this line then the ordering temperature can be en-
tirely accounted for by the magnitude of ∆. If, however,
the point lies signiﬁcantly above the theoretical curve,
then the long-range ordering is being assisted by an-
other process, such as interlayer coupling. As can be
seen, the experimentally-derived data point for 1, which
has the shortest interlayer distance of our four materials,
lies some way from the theoretical line, while 4, with a
slightly larger interlayer separation, is much closer. The
points for compounds 2 and 3, with their bulky axial lig-
ands and therefore large separation between planes, lie
close together, not far from the theoretical curve. This
implies that interlayer coupling appears to becomes less
important in determining the ordering temperature as
the copper-pyrazine layers are forced apart.

We can compare our results with those from related
materials. As has been mentioned, [Cu(HF2)(pyz)2]PF6
has a higher J, Tc and ∆ than [Cu(HF2)(pyz)2]ClO4 (1).
As a consequence the data point for this material lies
closer to the theoretical prediction in Figure 5(e) than

14

derstanding how the diﬀerent interactions determine the
magnetic ordering temperature.

New theoretical models will have to be developed in
order to achieve an independent estimate of both ∆ and
J⊥ from the Hamiltonian in Equation 9. Nevertheless,
Figure 5(e) implies that the magnetic order observed in
compounds 2 and 3 is predominantly driven by the spin
exchange anisotropy.
In contrast, in order to account
for the transition temperature of compound 1, ∆ would
have to be at least an order of magnitude larger than
is measured. Therefore, interlayer couplings, probably
including dipolar interactions, must play an important
role in stabilising the ordered state of this material.

VIII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have engineered a family of molecular materi-
als [Cu(HF2)(pyz)2]ClO4 (1), [CuL2(pyz)2](ClO4)2 [L =
pyO (2) and 4-phpyO (3)] that exhibit highly-2D anti-
ferromagnetism. By changing the axial ligands we have
shown that it is possible to vary considerably the inter-
layer spacings in these materials while at the same time
retaining the copper-pyrazine nearly-square-lattice motif
to a very good precision. By developing a consistent ESR
measurement procedure in conjunction with pulsed-ﬁeld
magnetometry, we have shown that the ligand substitu-
tion has only a small eﬀect on the single-ion properties
or the magnitude of eﬀective nearest-neighbor exchange
interactions within the 2D layers. Long-range magnetic
order is observed in all members of the family and the
ordering temperatures are found to decrease relatively
slowly with increasing interlayer separation, varying at
a rate of ∼ 10 mK/˚A. This slow variation implies that
other mechanisms in addition to or besides interlayer su-
perexchange drive the ordering transition. By determin-
ing the anisotropy ﬁelds in these materials we conclude
that a combination of spin-exchange anisotropy and in-
terlayer coupling (superexchange and/or dipolar inter-
actions) gives rise to the observed transition tempera-
tures in these materials.
In particular, the small spin-
exchange anisotropy in the intralayer exchange interac-
tion becomes increasingly more dominant in determining
the long-range ordering temperature as the layer spacing
increases.

Cu(pyz)2(ClO4)2 (4) is a well-known molecular anti-
ferromagnet, and has similar copper-pyrazine planes to
our family of compounds. Nevertheless, the intralayer
exchange energy J, and (hence) the magnetic ordering
temperature, are signiﬁcantly higher for this material,
reminiscent of the larger values of J found in some mem-
bers of the the [Cu(HF2)(pyz)2]X family of polymers.
To fully determine how this diﬀerence arises, as well as
to ascertain in more general terms the means by which
exchange is mediated through pyrazine and other molec-
ular ligands, considerable further work (e.g. density func-
tional theory, neutron scattering, spin density mapping)
will be required.

does compound 1. The measured interlayer separation
in the PF6 material is 6.785 ˚A at 15 K, which is slightly
larger than the equivalent distance of 6.594 ˚A measured
in 1 at 50 K. Also shown in the graph are the points for
16,70, but
[Cu(pyO)2(pyz)2](PF6)2 and Cu(pyz)2(BF4)2
as the structures of these compounds are not known at
100 K or below, a comparison with our materials is diﬃ-
cult. The data point for the former material lies right on
the theoretical curve. Its interlayer separation at room
temperature is known to be 13.189 ˚A, compared with
12.471 ˚A at the same temperature for 2, thus reinforc-
ing the trend. However, at low temperatures this sep-
aration will certainly not be as big as that for 3 with
the large 4-phpyO ligands, suggesting that factors be-
yond just the interlayer separation are important for un-

15

Our results imply that characterising the mechanism
of the in-plane symmetry breaking in real examples of
highly two-dimensional S = 1/2 antiferromagnets is
necessary to achieve a complete understanding of their
phase diagram and particularly the precise nature of
the ordered phases observed at very low temperatures
(e.g. N´eel, BerezinskyKosterlitzThouless, or 3D XY).
It is becoming increasingly clear that similar consid-
erations regarding in-plane symmetry are probably vi-
tal for explaining the high-temperature superconductiv-
ity observed in under-doped cuprates (see Ref. 75 and
references therein), whose parent phase is also a quasi-
two-dimensional S = 1/2 square-lattice antiferromag-
net. In addition, our data provide guidelines for future
attempts to create extremely two-dimensional quantum
magnets with highly suppressed ordering temperatures,
thereby engineering a magnetic system in close proximity
to a quantum critical point in the temperature-coupling
phase diagram. Clearly it is not suﬃcient to curb the
interlayer coupling alone; even in S = 1/2 systems ef-
forts must be taken to suppress any intralayer magnetic
anisotropy. We point out that for the related material
[Cu(HF2)(pyz)2]SbF6 it was not possible to detect any
spin-exchange anisotropy using either magnetometry or
neutron diﬀraction down to the lowest temperature mea-
sured 76, suggesting that the observed transition to long-
range order is driven predominantly by interlayer cou-
pling. That material, unlike the systems considered here,

has tetragonal structural symmetry in the ordered phase,
and it is probable that the magnetic anisotropy we ob-
serve in our materials is linked to their reduced structural
symmetry. Whether it is possible to produce a molecule-
based material with tetragonal symmetry at low temper-
atures and a large interlayer spacing is the subject of
continuing research.

45 Note that previous reports of the g-factors for some of these
materials have often been derived from measurements at
only one frequency, and/or at temperatures very close to
Tc, resulting in slight discrepancies with the values given
in the present work (c.f.11,24).

68 Kurmoo69 has shown that dipole interactions are respon-
sible for the ordering in the family of quasi-2D materials
based on cobalt hydroxide layers, which have interlayer
separations as large as 22.8 ˚A. In those materials the in-
tralayer exchange interactions are ferrimagnetic in nature

17

and so the onset of short-range order causes a signiﬁcant
moment to develop within the layers, thus enhancing the
eﬀectiveness of the dipolar coupling.
