ABSTRACT

We use the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Cycle 1 to determine spec-
troscopic redshifts of high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected by their 1.4 mm
continuum emission in the South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey. We present ALMA 3 mm spectral
scans between 84-114 GHz for 15 galaxies and targeted ALMA 1 mm observations for an additional
eight sources. Our observations yield 30 new line detections from CO, [C I], [N II], H2O and NH3. We
further present APEX [C II] and CO mid-J observations for seven sources for which only a single line
was detected in spectral-scan data from ALMA Cycle 0 or Cycle 1. We combine the new observa-
tions with previously published and new mm/submm line and photometric data of the SPT-selected
DSFGs to study their redshift distribution. The combined data yield 39 spectroscopic redshifts from
molecular lines, a success rate of >85%. Our sample represents the largest data set of its kind today
and has the highest spectroscopic completeness among all redshift surveys of high-z DSFGs. The
median of the redshift distribution is z=3.9 ± 0.4, and the highest-redshift source in our sample is
at z=5.8. We discuss how the selection of our sources aﬀects the redshift distribution, focusing on
source brightness, selection wavelength, and strong gravitational lensing. We correct for the eﬀect
of gravitational lensing and ﬁnd the redshift distribution for 1.4 mm-selected sources with a median
redshift of z=3.1 ± 0.3. Comparing to redshift distributions selected at shorter wavelengths from the
literature, we show that selection wavelength aﬀects the shape of the redshift distribution.

1. INTRODUCTION

In the last two decades, millimeter (mm) and sub-
millimeter (submm) surveys have transformed our un-
derstanding of galaxy formation and evolution by re-
vealing that luminous, dusty galaxies were a thousand
times more abundant in the early Universe than they
are at the present day (e.g., see review by Casey et al.
2014). The ﬁrst spectroscopic redshift distributions of
submm-selected galaxies indicated that the population
of dusty star forming galaxies (DSFGs) peaked at red-
shift z∼2.3 (e.g., Chapman et al. 2005), coeval with the
peak of black hole accretion and cosmic star formation
(e.g., Hopkins & Beacom 2006). These studies suggested
that a signiﬁcant fraction of star formation activity in
the universe at z=2−3 is taking place in DSFGs brighter
than S850µm≈1 mJy, and could be hidden from the view
of optical/UV observations owing to the large dust ob-
scuration (e.g., Wardlow et al. 2011). Theoretical mod-
els suggest that the contribution of DSFGs to the total
star formation rate density at z = 2 − −4 is of order 10%
(for sources with S870µm>1 mJy; Gonz´alez et al. 2011).
While the history of star formation has now been mea-
sured out to z ∼ 8 through rest-frame UV surveys (see
review by Madau & Dickinson 2014), progress in mea-
suring highly obscured star formation as a function of
look-back time has been much slower, mainly because of
the diﬃculties in obtaining robust redshifts for DSFGs.
Dust emission at high redshift (z>1) exhibits a steep
rise on the Rayleigh-Jeans side of the greybody spectrum
that counteracts the dimming from luminosity distance
(Blain & Longair 1993). This very negative K-correction
is suﬃcient to produce a nearly redshift-independent se-
lection of DSFGs at mm/submm wavelengths.

However, the poor spatial resolution (∼20′′) of the
single-dish submm telescopes used to perform extra-
galactic surveys has prevented immediate counterpart
identiﬁcation. This diﬃculty was further compounded by
the dust-obscured nature of DSFGs, which makes coun-
terpart identiﬁcation at optical wavelengths diﬃcult or
impossible. Even with high spatial resolution data taken
at radio (e.g., Ivison et al. 2002) and/or mid-infrared
(e.g., Ashby et al. 2006; Pope et al. 2006) wavelengths,
the slope of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
galaxies in the radio or mid-infrared (MIR) is such that
the K-correction is positive, and galaxies become more
diﬃcult to detect at high redshifts. Thus, 50% of DSFGs
typically lack robust counterparts at other wavelengths
(e.g., Biggs et al. 2011), although the exact fraction de-
pends on the depth of the radio/MIR observations. This
mismatch in sensitivity at diﬀerent wavelengths has po-
tentially left the highest-redshift sources (z>3) unidenti-
ﬁed, which would bias the observed redshift distribution
of DSFGs low.

Millimeter interferometry provides a more reliable
and complete method to obtain secure multi-wavelength
identiﬁcations of DSFGs discovered in single-dish sur-
veys. Dannerbauer et al. (2002) ﬁrst published coun-
terpart identiﬁcations based on high spatial resolu-
tion data for three 1.2 mm-selected DSFGs observed
with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI),
and Younger et al. (2007) used the Submillimeter Ar-
ray to identify counterparts to seven 1.1 mm-detected
sources.
In spite of the accurate and reliable posi-

tions, neither study successfully obtained redshifts for
the DSFGs, although one of the sources was eventually
determined to be at a record breaking (for DSFGs) z=5.3
from rest frame UV spectroscopy (Riechers et al. 2010;
Capak et al. 2011). Smolˇci´c et al. (2012) used PdBI to
follow up a sample of 1.1 mm selected DSFGs, leading
to optical spectroscopic redshifts for roughly half the
sample and photometric redshift estimates for the re-
maining sources, and these data suggested that the pre-
vious spectroscopically determined redshift distributions
of DSFGs (e.g., Chapman et al. 2005) were biased low.
Other follow-up eﬀorts have led to diﬀerent conclusions.
For example, Simpson et al. (2014) and more recently
da Cunha et al. (2015) use the 17-band optical to mid-IR
photometry of the Extended Chandra Deep Field South
(ECDFS) to study the photometric redshift distribution
of DSFGs with counterpart identiﬁcation based on high
resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Ar-
ray (ALMA) 870µm observations (Hodge et al. 2013).
Simpson et al. (2014) derive a median redshift of ¯z=2.5,
albeit with a signiﬁcant tail of DSFGs at z>4. This result
is consistent with the early ﬁndings of Chapman et al.
(2005) under the assumption that Chapman et al. (2005)
did not detect the high-redshift tail since that study only
targeted radio-conﬁrmed DSFGs.

In the past few years, new instruments with larger
bandwidths have enabled a more direct and unbiased
way to derive redshifts of DSFGs via observations of
molecular emission lines at mm wavelengths. The molec-
ular line emission, typically from CO, or [C II], can be
related unambiguously to the mm/submm dust contin-
uum, circumventing the need for high-resolution imag-
ing, counterpart identiﬁcation, and optical spectroscopy
(Weiß et al. 2009; Harris et al. 2012; Lupu et al. 2012;
Walter et al. 2012; Chapman et al. 2015). The ﬁrst red-
shift distribution based on molecular emission lines de-
tected via blind spectral scans in the 3 mm window us-
ing ALMA was published by Weiß et al. (2013) for 26
strongly lensed sources selected from the 2500 degree2
South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey. Performing a red-
shift search for such a big sample in the early stage of
ALMA operations was only possible due to the strongly
lens-magniﬁed nature of the sources which makes them
extraordinarily bright. The redshift distribution of the
SPT sample has a much higher mean (¯z=3.5) than ob-
served for any other sample of DSFGs and has stimu-
lated an on-going discussion on the redshift distribution
of DSFGs in the literature (e.g., Koprowski et al. 2014;
Miettinen et al. 2015; B´ethermin et al. 2015).

Progress has also been made towards a theoretical un-
derstanding of the diﬀerences seen in observed redshift
distributions. Recently B´ethermin et al. (2015) modeled
the expected DSFG redshift distribution based on a phe-
nomenological model of galaxy evolution. They conclude
the diﬀerence can be understood in terms of survey selec-
tion wavelength and, to a minor degree, the survey depth.
In addition, they investigate the eﬀect of gravitational
lensing on the redshift distribution. At wavelengths
shorter than 1.1 mm the lensed redshift distribution al-
ways tends to show a higher median redshift than the
unlensed distribution. At longer selection wavelengths,
as investigated here, the eﬀect of gravitational lensing on
the redshift distribution vanishes unless only extremely

luminous sources are selected (e.g., S1.4mm>25 mJy)

In this paper we extend the ALMA redshift survey
of 26 SPT-selected sources from Weiß et al. (2013) with
an additional 15 sources. We use this extended sample
to construct an updated redshift distribution of SPT-
selected DSFGs. We further present data from ALMA
and the Atacama Pathﬁnder Experiment (APEX) used
to conﬁrm redshifts for a sample of sources with ambigu-
ous redshifts from Weiß et al. (2013) and the new survey.
In Section 2, we present the ALMA observations along
with [C II] and CO observations carried out with APEX.
In Section 3, we show the spectra derived from these ob-
servations and present redshifts determined from those
spectra. In Section 4, we present the redshift distribu-
tion of DSFGs selected from the SPT survey and discuss
how the sample is aﬀected by gravitational lensing and
selection wavelength.

2. OBSERVATIONS

Observations presented in this work include ALMA
Cycle 1 observations in the 3 mm and 1 mm bands, as
well as observations from APEX using the First Light
APEX Submillimeter Heterodyne (FLASH) receiver, the
Swedish-ESO PI receiver for APEX (SEPIA), and the
Z-spec camera.

In ALMA Cycle 0, Weiß et al. (2013) set out to deter-
mine redshifts for 26 SPT-selected DSFGs using CO lines
in the ALMA 3 mm band. Unambiguous redshifts (from
multiple CO lines) were determined for twelve sources,
while 11 sources showed only a single line. Using the
same strategy in ALMA Cycle 1, we searched for CO in
the 3 mm band in 15 new sources; these observations are
presented in Section 2.2.

For sources with only one detected line in either 3 mm
redshift search, we use well-sampled photometry to de-
termine a photometric redshift and thereby the most
probable line identiﬁcation and redshift. We use this in-
formation to perform targeted redshift conﬁrmation ob-
servations, either in diﬀerent ALMA bands or using het-
erodyne receivers on APEX. For eight sources with single
line detections in the ALMA Cycle 0 redshift search, we
obtained ALMA Cycle 1 data in band 6 (1 mm) in an
attempt to detect a second CO line or a [N II] line; we
present these observations in Section 2.1. For ﬁve sources
(including one source observed in ALMA band 6 and
some single-line detections in the Cycle 1 redshift search),
we followed up the most probable redshift options with
APEX/FLASH (Section 2.3) and APEX/SEPIA (Sec-
tion 2.4). An additional one source in this sample was
observed in 2012 with APEX/Z-Spec (Section 2.5). An
overview of these observations is found in Table 1.

2.1. ALMA 1 mm follow up observations

In the ALMA 3 mm spectral scans presented in
Weiß et al. (2013), ten sources showed a single CO line
detection (plus one source, SPT0319-47, which showed
a line feature not signiﬁcant enough for detection).
In
these cases photometric measurements were used to vali-
date possible line assignments and to ﬁnd the most likely
redshift option (this approach is described in more detail
in Section 3.3.3). Using this method the redshifts of three

sources were quickly secured by APEX/FLASH follow-
up observations in [C II] (Gullberg et al. 2015). For the
eight remaining sources, we were awarded observing time
with ALMA in the Cycle 1 early science compact array
conﬁguration, to search for a second CO line (CO(6–5) –
CO(12–11)) or a [N II] line in ALMA band 6 (211 GHz -
275 GHz) (project ID 2012.1.00994.S). The eight sources
observed are listed in Table 1.

The sources were grouped into ﬁve science blocks based
on their sky position and tuning frequencies of possible
redshifted molecular emission lines (mainly CO). The
sidebands were placed so that these ﬁve science blocks
would yield at least one line for each source. One source
(SPT0441-46) is observed in two tunings since it had two
likely redshift options.

The observations were carried out from 2013 Decem-
ber to 2014 December. The ﬂux density calibration
was based on observations of the Solar System objects
Uranus, Neptune and Ganymede and the quasars J0334-
401 and J0519-454. The bandpass and phase calibration
were determined using nearby quasars. The number of
antennas used during the observations ranged from 25
to 40, with baselines less than 500 m resulting in a syn-
thesized beam size of 1.5×0.8 arcsec (′′). In band 6 the
primary beam is 29′′−23′′. The observing time for each
science block ranged from 8 to 20 minutes on-source, ex-
cluding overheads. Typical single-sideband (SSB) system
temperatures for the observations were Tsys=80–100 K.
The data were processed using the Common Astronomy
Software Application package (CASA McMullin et al.
2007; Petry et al. 2012). We used natural weighting and
constructed the spectra with a channel width of 19.5 MHz
(18−22 km s−1 for the highest and lowest observing fre-
quency). The typical noise per channel is 0.9–1.9 mJy
beam−1. Continuum images were cleaned and gener-
ated from the full bandwidth have typical noise levels
of 50 µJy beam−1.

2.2. ALMA 3 mm scans

Also in ALMA Cycle 1, we extended the Cycle 0 red-
shift search from Weiß et al. (2013) to 15 additional SPT-
selected DSFGs (project ID 2012.1.00844.S). As in the
Cycle 0 observations, we searched for CO lines in the
3 mm atmospheric transmission window (ALMA band 3).
As in Weiß et al. (2013), the sources targeted in the
Cycle 1 observations are a subset of a population of
rare and extremely bright galaxies in the SPT sur-
vey (Mocanu et al. 2013). The sources are selected
from 2.0 mm and 1.4 mm maps, and further vetoes (de-
scribed in Vieira et al. 2010; Weiß et al. 2013) remove
synchrotron-dominated blazars and low redshift sources
(z<0.1). The remaining sources are SPT-discovered
DSFGs (SPT-DSFGs), which are found to be at high
redshift and predominantly strongly lensed (Vieira et al.
2013; Hezaveh et al. 2013; Spilker et al. 2015).

The sources in the sample studied here are in
the SPT Deep Field that has full coverage from
both Herschel/SPIRE and Spitzer/IRAC. The sources
form a complete, ﬂux-density-limited sample with raw
S1.4mm>16 mJy within a 10 × 10 square-deg ﬁeld (12
sources). This selection and limitation is a consequence
of ALMA Cycle 1 target restrictions requiring that all
sources be within 10 deg of each other to share a phase
calibrator. In addition we included three fainter sources

DSFG sample (black ), with the 28 sources from Weiß et al. (2013)
(blue) and the new DSFGs from this work (red). Together these
two samples constitute a representative subset of the overall SPT-
DSFG sample. Top: APEX/LABOCA 870 µm ﬂux density as a

from the same ﬁeld (raw S1.4mm∼15 mJy) to reach the
maximum number of 15 science targets allowed in this
observing setup in Cycle 1.

Weiß et al. (2013) studied a subset of the SPT-DSFG
population selected using a higher raw ﬂux density cut
of S1.4mm>25 mJy, and thereby picking out the bright-
est sources of the SPT-DSFG population from a larger
area of the sky (1300 deg2 compared to 100 deg2 in this
work).
In Figure 1 we show photometric ﬂux densities
and 870 µm/350 µm ﬂux density ratios for the entire sam-
ple of SPT-DSFGs (black ), including the sample from
this work (red ) and the sample targeted in Weiß et al.
(2013) (blue). Note that the 1.4 mm SPT ﬂux densi-
ties shown here are deboosted ﬂux densities and not
raw ﬂux densities from which the original selection was
made. The top panel shows that the sample studied here
populates the fainter part of the SPT-DSFG sample at
both 1.4 mm and 870 µm, which is expected based on
the selection method. The redshift of the sources can
be inferred from the 870 µm to 350 µm ﬂux density ratio
shown in the bottom panel (where sources with a higher
870 µm/350 µm ﬂux density ratio typically are at higher

continuum images were also created and cleaned us-
ing natural weighting and were generated from the full
bandwidth. For these we have typical noise levels of
50 µJy beam−1.

By scanning the 3 mm window we are sensitive to
CO lines between the CO(1–0) and CO(7–6) transi-
tion, which gives a redshift coverage of 0.0<z<0.4 and
1.0<z<8.6 with a narrow redshift desert at 1.74<z<2.00,
see Figure 2. For more details on the observation strategy
and the spectral coverage of CO we refer to Weiß et al.
(2013).

2.3. APEX/FLASH [C II] follow-up

For a subset of sources with only one line in the ALMA
3 mm data (from either Cycle 0 or Cycle 1), we have per-
formed APEX/FLASH (Klein et al. 2014) observations
in the 345 GHz and 460 GHz transmission window (see
Table 1 for a list of targets). The data were obtained
using Max Planck Society observing time in the period
2015 March to August. All observations were done in
good weather conditions with an average precipitable
water vapor of pwv<1.0 mm, yielding typical system
temperatures of Tsys=240 K. The observations were
performed and the data processed in the same manner
as described in Gullberg et al. (2015). Further details
on the sources targeted in these observations can be
found along with the [C II] spectra in Appendix A and B.

2.4. APEX/SEPIA CO follow-up

For two sources (SPT0002-52 and SPT2349-50) we
see a single bright line in the 3 mm ALMA spectrum
both with the most probable identiﬁcation being CO(3–
2). We have obtained APEX/SEPIA 158 – 211 GHz
(Billade et al. 2012) observations conﬁrming the redshift
of these source by observing the CO(5–4) and CO(7–6)
line for SPT0002-52 and SPT2349-50 respectively.
The observations were carried out in 2015 September
- November during ESO time (E-096.A-0939A-2015)
under good weather conditions with an average pre-
cipitable water vapor pwv<1.0 mm yielding typical
system temperatures of Tsys=150 K. The data were
reduced in the same manner as the APEX/FLASH [C II]
observations described above. Details on the sources
along with the spectrum can be found in Appendix B.

2.5. APEX/Z-Spec spectrum

(Naylor et al.

For one source in the sample presented here (SPT0551-
48), we used APEX/Z-Spec
2003;
Bradford et al. 2009) to search for high-J CO lines in
the frequency range 190 – 310 GHz and thereby identify
the redshift of the source.
The observations were
obtained in November 2012 in good weather conditions.
The reduction of the data was done in the same manner
as described in Bothwell et al. (2013). The resulting
spectrum showed several lines identifying the redshift as
z=2.5833(2) and it can be found in Appendix B along
with a description of the source.

redshifts). This plot shows that the sample studied here
is not expected to have a diﬀerent redshift distribution
compared to the full SPT DSFG sample. Together with
the Weiß et al. (2013) sample it is a representative sam-
ple of the full SPT-DSFG population.

The Cycle 1 ALMA 3 mm spectral scans were carried
out in 2013 July and 2013 December in the Cycle 1
early science compact array conﬁguration. The observa-
tions were set up as spectral scans using ﬁve tunings to
cover the 3 mm atmospheric transmission window (See
Figure 2). Each tuning consists of two 3.75 GHz wide
sidebands covered by two 1.875 GHz spectral windows
in the ALMA correlator, which in total gives 7.5 GHz
coverage. This setup spans 84.2−114.9 GHz, where the
range 96.1−103.0 GHz is covered twice. Over this fre-
quency range the FWHM of ALMA’s primary beam is
61′′−45′′. The observations were not carried out for all
tunings at the same time and the tunings were there-
fore observed with a diﬀerent number of antennas rang-
ing from 28 to 40, which resulted in typical synthesized
beams of 3.7′′ × 2.4′′ to 3.0′′ × 1.8′′ from the low to high-
frequency ends of the band. The sources were observed
for 120 seconds each, in each tuning, which amounts to
roughly 10 minutes per source in total. Typical sys-
tem temperatures for the observations were Tsys=60–
90 K (SSB). Flux calibration was performed on Uranus
or Mars and passband and phase calibration were deter-
mined from nearby quasars. We used the CASA package
to process the data. The cubes were created using natu-
ral weighting to optimize the sensitivity and constructed
with a channel width of 19.5 MHz (50–65 kms−1). The
is 1.5–2 mJy beam−1. The

Strandet, M. et al.

Here we provide an overview of the photometry mea-
surements used to determine dust temperatures and as-
sign probabilistic redshift estimates to the sources with
single-line detections.

The ALMA 3 mm ﬂux densities were extracted as the
peak ﬂux density of the point sources on the cleaned
continuum map and the error was determined as the rms
in the area just around the source. For SPT2349-56,
which is slightly spatially extended, we integrated over
the entire source (see Section 2.2).

The SPT 1.4 mm and 2.0 mm ﬂux densities were ex-
tracted and deboosted as described by Mocanu et al.
(2013).

With APEX/LABOCA we obtained 870 µm ﬂux den-
sities in two Max Planck Institute observing programs in
the period 2010 September - 2012 November. The obser-
vations and data processing are described in Greve et al.
(2012).

The Herschel/SPIRE maps at 250 µm, 350 µm and
500 µm were observed in two observing programs
OT1 jvieira 4 and OT2 jvieira 5 in the period 2012 Au-
gust – 2013 March. The Herschel/SPIRE data consists
of triple repetition maps, with coverage complete to a ra-
dius of 5 arcmin(′) from the nominal SPT position. The
maps were produced via the standard reduction pipeline
HIPE v9.0. The ﬂux densities were extracted by ﬁtting
a Gaussian to the source and using the peak as the ﬂux
density. The ﬂux densities have been corrected for pixe-
lation as described in the SPIRE Observers Manual. The
noise was estimated by taking the RMS in the central few
arcmins of the map which is then added in quadrature
to the uncertainty due to pixelation.

The Herschel/PACS maps were obtained in the pro-
grams OT1 jvieira 4 and DDT mstrande 1. The data
were recorded simultaneously at 100 and 160 µm. Each
scan comprises ten separate 3 ′ strips, each oﬀset or-
thogonally by 4 ′′. The two PACS maps were co-added,
weighted by coverage. The ﬂux densities were extracted
using apertures, with sizes ﬁxed to 7 ′ for the 100 µm
map and for 10 ′ for the 160 µm map. The aperture sizes
were determined based on Figure 17 and the aperture
correction based on Table 15 in the PACS Photometer
- Point-Source Flux Calibration document released from
Herschel.23 The uncertainty was obtained by random
aperture photometry in the few central arcmins.

When ﬁtting to the SEDs we have added in quadra-
ture an absolute calibration uncertainty of 7% for Her-
schel/PACS and 10% for all other wavelengths.

2.7. Ancillary spectroscopic observations

In addition to the primary data presented here, we also
make use of spectroscopic data taken at radio and optical
wavelengths.

Simultaneously with the ALMA and APEX redshift
conﬁrmation observations, we carried out follow-up ob-
servations with Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA) targeting low-J CO transitions. These data are
presented in Spilker et al. (2014), Aravena et al. (2013)
and Aravena et al. (2015) and helped to secure some of
the redshifts before the delivery of the ALMA data. Re-
sults from these observations are discussed in Section 3.2

23 http://herschel.esac.esa.int/twiki/pub/Public/
PacsCalibrationWeb/pacs bolo ﬂuxcal report v1.pdf

and included in Table 2.

Optical spectroscopy was performed for SPT2357-51
on the night of 2013 October 16 with the X-shooter ech-
elon spectrograph (Vernet et al. 2011) on the ESO VLT-
UT2 (Kueyen) as part of program E-092.A-0503(A), with
near-continuous spectroscopy from 0.3 µm to 2.48 µm
with a 1.′′2-wide and 11′′-long slit. Seeing conditions
were ∼0.8′′, taken at low average airmass of 1.2. The
resolving power attained for our IR-channel observations
was R = 5000. The resolving power for the optical
channel was R = 6700. We used the ESO pipeline
(Modigliani et al. 2010) to reduce our data. This pipeline
applied spatial and spectral rectiﬁcation to the spectra,
and the data were ﬂat-ﬁelded and cosmic rays were iden-
tiﬁed and masked. The two dither positions were sub-
tracted to remove the sky to ﬁrst order, and the diﬀerent
echelle orders were combined together into a continuous
spectrum (taking into account the variation in through-
put with wavelength in diﬀerent overlapping echelle or-
ders) before spatially registering and combining the data
taken at the two dither positions, and removing any
residual sky background.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Targeted ALMA 1 mm observations

In the 1 mm continuum images all sources but one
are spatially unresolved and are detected with signal–
to–noise ratios (SNRs) of 25–100. For the spatially re-
solved source (SPT0512-59, see Appendix A), the bright-
est component is detected with a SNR of 9, and we
extract the source spectrum from this component. All
1 mm spectra are shown in Figure 3 (smoothed to lower
velocity resolution for better visualization of the lines).
We detect spectral line features in all sources, includ-
ing emission lines from various CO transitions, [N II] and
several H2O transitions and absorption lines from H2O+
and NH3. More details on the lines/transitions can be
found in the description of the individual sources in Ap-
pendix A.

The most important result from our ALMA 1 mm ob-
servations, with respect to the source redshifts, is that
they conﬁrm the most probable redshifts as given in
Weiß et al. (2013) for all except one source (see Table 2).
The one exception had two almost equally likely redshift
options and the source turned out to be at the slightly
less likely redshift. As such, our 1 mm follow-up observa-
tions demonstrate that reliable redshifts for DSFGs can
be obtained when only a single line is detected in the
3 mm redshift scan, provided that the dust continuum
spectral energy distribution (SED) of the source is well
sampled.

One of the sources included in our 1 mm follow-up pro-
gram (SPT0319-47) was presented as having no lines de-
tected in its ALMA 3 mm scan in Weiß et al. (2013).
The 3 mm spectrum, however, did show a very broad
(FWHM ∼ 1700 km s−1), faint line feature at 104.4 GHz.
In our 1 mm follow-up observations we now detect a
highly signiﬁcant line at 250.76 GHz in this source. This
detection identiﬁes the 3 mm and 1 mm lines as CO(5–4)
and CO(12–11) placing SPT0319-47 at z=4.516(4). This
source was also detected in [C II] with APEX/FLASH ce-
menting the redshift (see Appendix A).

extended galactic foreground.24 These two sources have
low SNRs in the SPT maps and are ignored in the fol-
lowing. For the third source we would have expected a
detection, but the non-detection is consistent with the
overall SED of the source (see Appendix D).

Table 1 lists the ALMA 3 mm continuum position for
the 12 detected sources. Their 3 mm continuum ﬂux den-
sities are given in Appendix C.

Figure 3. ALMA 1 mm spectra for sources with redshifts based on a single submm emission line from Weiß et al. (2013) (see Section
3.1). For each source we show the LSB and USB spectra in the left and right panel, respectively. Each sideband has a total bandwidth of
3.9 GHz.
3.2. A misidentiﬁed redshift: The discovery and solution
SPT0551-50 was identiﬁed in Weiß et al. (2013) as a se-
cure redshift at z = 2.1232(2) based on a single CO line
detection (identiﬁed as CO(3–2)) in conjunction with a
detection of the CIV line from the Very Large Telescope
(VLT). We afterwards failed to detect [C II] with APEX
(Gullberg et al. 2015) and CO(1–0) with ATCA at this
redshift.
In particular the non-detection of the ATCA
CO(3−2)/L′
line is very signiﬁcant with L′
CO(1−0) > 6 com-
pared to L′
∼ 1.2 for sources with se-
cure redshifts (Spilker et al. 2014) where L′ is the line lu-
minosity (in K km s−1 pc2, see Solomon et al. 1997) and
rules out the earlier redshift determination by Weiß et al.
(2013). Based on this we re-visited the other redshift op-
tions. The favored option based on the dust continuum
SED is z=3.163(3) with the line in the ALMA 3 mm
spectrum being CO(4–3). This redshift was conﬁrmed
by new [C II] observations with APEX/FLASH. The line
observed with VLT and interpreted as CIV most likely
originates from an unrelated lensing arc. For a more de-
tailed description on the source and a presentation of the
above mentioned data see Appendix A.

Ten sources appear as point sources, and two sources
(SPT2340-59 and SPT2349-56) split into multiple com-
ponents. Multiple components can be explained in two
ways: We either see multiple individual sources or mul-
tiple gravitationally lensed images of the lensed source.
For SPT2340-59 we see two components (listed in Table
1, and named A and B respectively, see Appendix B for
the continuum image). We extract spectra at both posi-
tions, but only see a line in component A, which we then
use in the further analysis. For SPT2349-56 we see two
components, one point source and one more extended
component. For this source we take advantage of also
having high resolution ALMA 870 µm imaging, which
shows three counterparts.
In this image the extended
3 mm component breaks up into two point sources and
we use the three 870 µm positions to deﬁne the three
components A, B, and C listed in Table 1 and shown in
Appendix B). We see a hint of a line at the same fre-
quency in all components (with small peak shifts), with
component B and C showing stronger lines. It is not clear
if the components belong to the same system (though the
distance to component A suggests otherwise) or poten-

3.3.1. Continuum results and morphology

We detect the 3 mm continuum in 12 out of 15 sources
at SNRs of 5–18. For two sources the non-detection in
ALMA was expected after a careful analysis of all pho-
tometric data (only available to us after ALMA’s Cycle
1 deadline) showed that both sources are likely due to

tially only component B and C. We use a stack of all three
components in the further analysis. This continuum mor-
phology suggests that the two sources (SPT2340-59 and
SPT2349-56) are made up of multiple distinct sources.

3.3.2. Spectroscopy results

The ALMA spectra of the 12 sources are presented in
Figure 4. The spectrum for SPT2344-51 is not shown,
since without the ALMA 3 mm continuum detection, we
do not know the source position with suﬃcient accuracy
to be able to extract the spectrum. We veriﬁed, however,
that the data cube for this source does not contain any
strong lines. In total we see 16 lines in the 12 spectra,
which we identify as 12CO and [C I] emission lines. We
have marked the CO and [C I] lines that we do not detect
in grey, where the horizontal line represents the expected
ﬂux density based on the SPT-DSFG line luminosities
from Spilker et al. (2014).

The lines are distributed over the sources in the

following manner:

• Four sources show two or more lines, yielding an
unambiguous redshift from the 3 mm data alone (see
Table 2 top).
• Seven sources show a single line in the 3 mm
spectra.
For three sources (SPT2335-53, SPT2349-

56 and SPT2353-50) we have detected [C II] with
APEX/FLASH, and for two sources (SPT0002-52 and
SPT2349-50) we have detected CO using APEX/SEPIA.
These additional lines secure the redshifts of the ﬁve
sources. For the remaining two sources we use the dust
SEDs to obtain the line identiﬁcation and the redshift
(see Section 3.3.3).
• One source shows no lines. For this source we ﬁnd
an absorption line in our 870 µm high resolution ALMA
imaging cube determining the redshift (see Section
3.3.4).

3.3.3. Sources with one detected line

For the three sources where only a single line is de-
tected in the 3 mm spectrum, the ﬁrst step in determin-
ing their redshift is to identify the possible line identiﬁ-
cations. We work under the assumption that the line is
from a transition in CO. For an overview of which lines
are detectable in our 3 mm spectral scans from sources
at a given redshift, see Figure 2 and Spilker et al. (2014).
The most likely line identiﬁcations are either CO(2–
1) or CO(3–2), as these lines appear in the observed
band without any other lines present for a large red-
shift interval (1.0<z<3.0 with a narrow redshift desert
at 1.7<z<2.0). At most redshifts CO(4–3) and CO(5–4)

come with a [C I] line in the observing band, and will
only appear as single lines in very small redshift inter-
vals or when the fainter [C I] line remains undetected. We
rule out J=6-5 and higher transitions as they will always
come with another CO line in the observed band.

We use photometric data to determine the most likely
redshift option for each source. We do this as in
Weiß et al. (2013); the method is brieﬂy described here.
By ﬁtting modiﬁed black body laws to the thermal dust
emission of the sources, we can ﬁnd the photometric red-
shift by assuming a dust temperature distribution for our
sources; similarly, we can ﬁnd the implied dust temper-
ature for a speciﬁc redshift option. The thermal dust
emission of the SPT-DSFGs is sampled by the following
photometric observations: 3 mm ALMA; 2 and 1.4 mm
SPT; 870 µm APEX/LABOCA; 500, 350 and 250 µm
Herschel/SPIRE; and for most sources 160 and 100 µm
Herschel/PACS. This data is described in Section 2.6 and
the ﬂux densities are given in Appendix C.

To ﬁt the SEDs we use the method described in
Greve et al. (2012), with a spectral slope of β=2, the
optically thin/thick transition wavelength of 100 µm, and
taking the cosmic microwave background (CMB) into ac-
count. We ignore data shortwards of restframe 50 µm in
order to only ﬁt the cold component of the thermal dust
emission, as a single temperature SED can usually not
describe all the thermal dust emission. The free param-
eters for the ﬁt are dust temperature (Tdust) and dust
mass. Due to the degeneracy between dust tempera-
ture and redshift we have to assume a dust temperature
to ﬁnd the redshift. We investigate the dust tempera-
ture of our sample by ﬁtting SEDs to all sources with
a secure redshift and create a probability distribution
for each source. We add these to create a probability
distribution for the dust temperature for the full sam-
ple of sources with unambiguous redshifts. The proba-
bility distribution of the dust temperature is shown in
Figure 5 (green), with the median dust temperature of
Tdust=39±10 K indicated by the triangle.
In this plot
we have also plotted the temperature distribution for
all sources from Weiß et al. (2013) with an unambigu-
ous redshift (brown) and for all sources in this work with
an unambiguous redshift (blue). In Table 2 we show the
dust temperature of each source along with their rest
frame SED peak wavelength.

For each source, we create a photometric redshift
probability distribution by randomly sampling 103 tem-
peratures from the Tdust distribution obtained from all
sources with unambiguous redshifts and using this dust
temperature in the SED ﬁt for the source. The peak of
this distribution is then used as the photometric redshift
with its errors reﬂected by the 1 σ conﬁdence interval
around the peak. This produces asymmetric errors but
here we choose the larger of the two to be conservative.
We use this technique to test the redshift options for all
four sources with a single line identiﬁcation (see sources
with redshifts given in blue in Figure 6). We calculate
the probability of each redshift option by reading oﬀ the
probability of each option from the photometric redshift
probability distribution and normalizing the total prob-
ability to unity.

In Figure 6 we show all sources with a single line
in their ALMA 3 mm spectrum from both Weiß et al.
(2013) and this work. We use the current dust tem-

perature distribution (green distribution in Figure 5)
to calculate the probabilities for the line identiﬁcations
for all the sources in the Figure. This means that this
is not the same prediction as was made for the source
before its redshift was found but it serves to show how
well the current method predicts redshifts. We show the
spectroscopic redshift of each source in green and where
the prediction does not correspond to the spectroscopic
redshift we have highlighted the redshift in red. For
the sources which do not have a spectroscopic redshift
the most probable redshift is highlighted in blue.
In a
sample of 15 sources with a single line in their ALMA
spectrum we correctly predict the redshift for 12 sources
(80% success rate). This seems to be a reliable but
not perfect method so to be certain of the redshifts
presented we continue our observing campaigns to
obtain an extra line. All sources from Weiß et al. (2013)
which previously only had a single line observed now
have a second line observed and thereby have secure
redshifts. The redshifts for the sources with single line
detections are listed unbolded in Table 2.

CO(6–5)/L′

CO(5–4)

In two of the cases where we ﬁnd one line in the
ALMA spectrum we would expect to detect a second
CO line given their most probable or conﬁrmed red-
shift. For SPT2353-50 the ALMA 3 mm line is found
to be CO(5–4) based on the detection of [C II] but we
do not detect the CO(6–5) line that is expected to
also be in the spectrum.
It may be associated with
a SNR∼1.5 feature in the spectrum at the position of
the line. Using the stacked spectrum of the SPT-DSFGs
(Spilker et al. 2014) we calculate the line luminosity ratio
L′
∼0.7 for the SPT-DSFGs presented in
Weiß et al. (2013). The SNR∼1.5 feature gives a line lu-
minosity ratio of L′
∼0.3. For SPT2349-
56, the ALMA 3 mm line is found to be CO(4–3) based on
the detection of [C II] but we do not detect the CO(5–4)
line, though it can be associated with a SNR∼1.5 feature
in the spectrum at the predicted frequency of the CO(5–
4) line. From Spilker et al. (2014) the line luminosity
ratio is L′
∼1.1. The SNR∼1.5 feature
gives a line luminosity ratio of L′
∼0.7.
In both cases the second line have a lower than expected
line luminosity ratios but not inconsistent with typical
line ratios found in high redshift sources (e.g. see review
by Carilli & Walter 2013).

3.3.4. Sources without ALMA line detections

As mentioned above, we searched for emission lines in
the ALMA data cube of SPT2344-51 (which remained
undetected in the 3 mm continuum data), but did not
ﬁnd evidence for any strong lines despite its photomet-
ric redshift of zphot=3.5±0.7. Given the faintness of
this source in the continuum, the most likely interpre-
tation is that it is simply too faint to detect its CO
lines at the sensitivity limit of our observations. This
most likely also holds for the two remaining sources with-
out line detections from Weiß et al. (2013) (SPT0128-51
& SPT0457-49). Their 1.4 mm and 870 µm continuum
ﬂux densities are comparable to those of SPT2344-51,
which place them at the faint end of the SPT sources
targeted with ALMA though we do detect these sources
in continuum. For SPT0457-49 we searched the redshift

the ALMA 3 mm spectrum, for 3 sources the redshifts
were found using Z-Spec/APEX, and for the remaining
13 sources the redshift was secured with observations of
a second molecular line from ALMA, APEX, ATCA or
Herschel/SPIRE.

The redshift distribution of this sample is shown in or-
ange in Figure 7 and listed in Table 3. The median red-
shift is z=3.9±0.4 (indicated by an orange triangle above
the distribution). The errors on the median were deter-
mined using a bootstrap method, where we randomly
sampled 39 sources from the redshift distribution 1000
times and took the standard deviation of the median val-
ues.

The distribution is ﬂat between z=2.5 and z=5.0 with
a large fraction (75%) of the sample at z>3. We see no
sources at z<1.5 as the probability of a source undergoing
strong gravitational lensing drops signiﬁcantly below a
redshift of z∼2.

In the top panel of Figure 7 we overlay the distri-
bution from Weiß et al. (2013) (dashed red line). As
the sample in Weiß et al. (2013) was selected from 1300
square-degrees with S1.4mm>20 mJy, it is representative
of the brightest sources from the SPT-DSFG sample.
The diﬀerence in ﬂux at various wavelengths between
the two samples is shown in Figure 1. Models from
B´ethermin et al. (2015) predict that the diﬀerence be-
tween these two samples based on the change in ﬂux cut
are negligible. The only redshift bins in which we see
a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between this sample and that of
Weiß et al. (2013), are those in the range 1.5<z<2.5. In
Weiß et al. (2013), all three sources without line detec-
tions were placed in the 1.5<z<2.5 bin assuming they
fell into the CO redshift desert (1.74<z<2.00). As dis-
cussed in Section 3.3.4, we do not follow this approach,
but ignore sources without detected lines. Removing
these sources from the distribution of Weiß et al. (2013)
(except for SPT0319-47 which now enters with an un-
ambiguous redshift) and correcting the one misidentiﬁed
redshift (SPT0551-50, see Section 3.2) changes the me-
dian from z=3.6 to z=3.8, which is consistent with what
we ﬁnd in this work. A Kolmogorov Smirnov (K-S) test
show that the probability that these two distributions
originate from a common sample is p=0.81.

methods on the redshift distribution. The two main ef-

desert with ATCA looking for CO(1–0) without success
(see Appendix A). Without deeper data we cannot de-
termine their redshift and we drop these three sources
in the analysis of the redshift distribution. A summary
of the sources for which we do not detect any lines is
presented at the bottom of Table 2.

The situation is diﬀerent for SPT2354-58, which does
not show indications for CO lines in the ALMA Cy-
cle 1 3 mm spectrum. Here the continuum ﬂux densi-
ties (see Appendix C) are such that we should have de-
tected CO lines based on the line to continuum ratio of
the SPT sources where we detect lines. For this source
we ﬁnd an absorption line in our 870 µm high resolu-
tion imaging data cube. This absorption line has two
line identiﬁcations that fall outside the redshift range
probed by the 3 mm redshift search: OH+(122 – 011) at
z=1.867(1) (in the redshift desert) and H2O(110 −101) at
z=0.6431(3) (below our searched redshift range). There
could possibly be more molecules which may show up
in absorption, but we limit the discussion to the most
likely ones. OH+(122 – 011), unlike H2O(110 − 101), has
been detected in the local ultra luminous galaxy Arp220
(Rangwala et al. 2011). Furthermore, for the second op-
tion we should have seen CO(5–4) in the same cube but
we did not. The ﬁrst redshift option is also preferred by
the photometry (see Figure 6) and it is thus the most
likely redshift and we have added this source to our list
of sources with single-line redshifts (see Table 2). The
ALMA 870 µm spectra are shown along with a more de-
tailed description of the source in Appendix B.

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. The redshift distribution

Our sample is composed of 39 sources with reliable
redshifts (three from APEX/Z-Spec and 36 from ALMA
3 mm scans), meaning that they show at least one spec-
tral line along with well-sampled photometry. This trans-
lates into a success rate for our ALMA 3 mm scan tech-
nique of > 85% (36 out of 41 targeted). Two or more
lines have been identiﬁed in 35 of the 39 sources (∼ 80%).
For 18 sources the redshifts were identiﬁed directly from

spectrum based on the dust temperature distribution shown in Figure 5. To the far left we show a similar analysis for the line identiﬁcations
for the absorption line in the 870 µm data for SPT2354-58. The sources are sorted by redshift (spectroscopic if available and otherwise most
probable). The bars represent the possible line identiﬁcation. Sources where the most probable redshift is identical to the spectroscopic
redshift are highlighted in green; sources where the most probable redshift is not the spectroscopic redshift are highlighted in red. Sources
for which we do not yet have a conﬁrmed spectroscopic redshift with at least two lines are highlighted in blue.

fects come from our high ﬂux cut that selects almost
exclusively gravitationally lensed sources and our long
selection wavelength.

As discussed in Blain et al. (2002), da Cunha et al.
(2013), and Staguhn et al. (2014) the CMB could make
cold DSFGs at high redshifts diﬃcult to detect. As SPT-
DSFGs have a median dust temperature of Tdust=39 K,
and are thus quite warm, this eﬀect only becomes rele-
vant at very high redshifts (z>10). For the sources pre-
sented in this work, the eﬀect of the CMB is negligible.
In the two following sections we describe the two main
selection eﬀects, gravitational lensing and wavelength se-
lection, which complicate a direct comparison between
the redshift distributions of DSFGs in the literature.

4.2.1. Lensing eﬀects and lensing-correction

Based on models of the high-redshift DSFG pop-
ulation (e.g. Baugh et al. 2005; Lacey et al. 2010;
B´ethermin et al. 2012; Hayward et al. 2013), we would
expect very few sources intrinsically bright enough to
exceed our adopted ﬂux density threshold at 1.4 mm
(>16 mJy), and we thus expect the SPT-DSFG sam-
ple to consist almost solely of gravitationally lensed
sources (Blain 1996; Negrello et al. 2007). This expec-
tation was conﬁrmed by ALMA 870 µm high resolu-
tion observations showing that our sources resolve into
arcs, multiple images, and Einstein rings, characteris-
tic of lensed objects (Vieira et al. 2013; Hezaveh et al.
2013; Spilker et al. 2014). We have found a few exam-
ples where the source splits into multiple, ultra luminous
galaxies (e.g., SPT2349-56; see Appendix B) but these
are rare in our sample.

Gravitational lensing is what enables us to study these
high redshift sources in detail but also hampers a direct
comparison of our results to unlensed samples. Figure
8, based on the model presented in Hezaveh & Holder
(2011), shows the probability of a source undergoing
strong gravitational lensing between a given source red-
shift and the observer. The probability of sources at
z.1.5 undergoing strong lensing is heavily suppressed
relative to sources at higher redshifts (z>4), where the
probability of lensing is ﬂat. The lensing probability at
z∼2 is suppressed by a factor of three compared to at

high redshifts, while at z∼3 this is reduced to a fac-
tor of less than two. All of these ﬁndings assume that
DSFGs do not undergo a systematic size evolution with
increasing redshift. Detailed discussions of this point
can be found in Weiß et al. (2013), B´ethermin et al.
(2015), Ikarashi et al. (2015), and Simpson et al. (2015),
in which it is concluded that there is no evidence for size
evolution with redshift, although there are not enough
measurements at high redshift (z>4) to exclude the pos-
sibility of size evolution entirely.

To compare our sample to other samples from the lit-
erature, we correct our redshift distribution for the ef-
fect of gravitational lensing. We do this by dividing the
redshift distribution by the probability for strong grav-
itational lensing as a function of redshift using the av-
erage magniﬁcation of our sample of µ∼10 (see Figure
8). This yields the blue redshift distribution shown in
the middle panel of Figure 7, and the median of our
distribution decreases from z=3.9 ± 0.4 to z=3.1 ± 0.3
after the lensing-correction. To be able to calculate the
error on the median of the lensing-corrected sample we
randomly sample 39 sources 1000 times from the lensing-
corrected redshift distribution. For each sample we ﬁnd
the standard deviation of the median and we use the
mean of these as the error. A K-S comparison of the ob-
served and lensing-corrected distributions gives a value
of p=0.23. In other words, gravitational lensing does not
appear to have a statistically signiﬁcant impact on our
measurement of the redshift distribution of DFSGs.

We use a single magniﬁcation to produce our lensing-
corrected redshift distribution, which is a simpliﬁed
approximation. The observed range of magniﬁcations
from the SPT DSFGs is 1<µ<33 with <µ>≈9 (see
Hezaveh et al. 2013, and Spilker et al. in prep.). The rel-
ative shape of the lensing probability kernel (Figure 8) for
diﬀerent magniﬁcations is identical, but oﬀset vertically
for higher or lower magniﬁcations. It is not obvious, a
priori, that using a single magniﬁcation factor to lensing-
correct our redshift distribution is a valid assumption.
To test this assumption, we compare our lensed and
lensing-corrected redshift distributions to a lensed and
unlensed model population from B´ethermin et al. (2015)
in Figure 7 (middle panel). As discussed above, we

itational lensing as in Hezaveh & Holder (2011). The
model agrees well with our observed redshift distribu-
tion (Sum of squared residuals, weighted by the inverse
square of the errors χ2=8.9 over 9 bins, median redshift
= 3.6/3.9 for model/observed distributions). The good
agreement also holds if we use a slightly higher ﬂux cut
of S1.4mm> 25 mJy as in Weiß et al. (2013). The un-
lensed model population is selected from the same model
by “demagnifying” the SPT DSFG ﬂux cut by a factor of
µ=10, i.e. S1.4mm>1.6 mJy (green). With such a low ﬂux
cut, the number counts of unlensed sources completely
dominates the lensed source counts. The model predic-
tion for this sample has a median of z=3.1, in excellent
agreement with our lensing-corrected redshift distribu-
tion, with χ2=9.7 over 9 bins. The good agreement be-
tween the redshift distributions indicates that our simple
method of lensing-correcting using a single magniﬁcation
is a satisfactory approximation.

4.2.2. The inﬂuence of the selection wavelength

The other major inﬂuence on our redshift distribution
is the selection wavelength. As discussed in Blain et al.
(2002), Zavala et al. (2014), and Casey et al. (2014), the
source selection function of mm and submm surveys
varies with redshift, which aﬀects the observed redshift
distribution. In general, for surveys down to mJy depths,
a longer wavelength selection will lead to a higher ob-
served redshift distribution.

In the bottom panel of Figure 7, we compare our
lensing-corrected redshift distribution to redshift distri-
butions from the literature selected at diﬀerent wave-
lengths. To make the distributions comparable to ours,
we have removed sources with redshifts below z<1.5, be-
cause the probability of strong gravitational lensing as a
function of source redshift strongly disfavors the presence
of these sources in our SPT-DSFG sample (see Figure 8).
We focus on the redshift distributions published since
Weiß et al. (2013). As these distributions were selected
from a small area (<1 deg2) on the sky using a lower
ﬂux cut and are therefore made up of mostly unlensed
sources, we compare to our lensing-corrected redshift dis-
tribution.

JCMT/AzTEC and followed up with high-resolution
PdBI imaging. They add these new 15 sources to the
1.1 mm selected sources from Smolˇci´c et al. (2012), also
found using JCMT/AzTEC, and updated the redshifts
where better data was available. The ﬁnal sample
consists of 30 sources selected at 1.1 mm with a mix of
photometric and spectroscopic redshifts (see Figure 7,
grey). (Note that the distribution looks slightly diﬀerent
from the one shown by Miettinen et al. (2015) as they
use probability functions for their redshifts and we use
the redshifts given in their Table 4.) The median of
this distribution is z=3.0, similar to ours, with a K-S
comparison probability of p=0.29 which means that
these two distribution are likely to be from the same
common distribution.

Simpson et al. (2014) created a sample of 97 870 µm-
selected sources, using high resolution ALMA data to
identify the counterparts. They present a photometric
redshift distribution containing 77 sources (where a frac-
tion has spectroscopic redshifts) from the ALESS cat-
alogue (Hodge et al. 2013; Karim et al. 2013), which is
a sample of ALMA 870 µm-conﬁrmed sources from the
ECDF-S. The redshift distribution is shown in the bot-
tom panel of Figure 7 (pink ). The photometric red-
shifts are based on a combination of radio, submm and
NIR-optical data, and only sources with four or more
data points are considered. Their median photometric
redshift of z=2.3 is consistent with what was found by
Chapman et al. (2005), though the redshift distribution
of Simpson et al. (2014) shows an excess of high-redshift
sources over the earlier work, which relied on radio-
wavelength counterpart identiﬁcation. Their distribu-
tion diﬀers signiﬁcantly from ours with a K-S comparison
probability p=0.03. In the paper they present another 19
sources with less than four photometry points. The red-
shifts for these are not given, but we tried to add 19
sources randomly in the redshift range 2.5<z<6.0 which
gives a K-S comparison probability of p=0.04. Both these
values are below p<0.05, indicating they are not drawn
from the same distribution.

In addition to studying the

eﬀect of gravita-
tional
lensing on the redshift distribution of DSFGs,
B´ethermin et al. (2015) studied how their model predicts
the shape and median of redshift distributions for sam-
ples selected at diﬀerent wavelengths. They found that
the diﬀerence in redshift distributions seen in Figure 7
can be reasonably explained by the wavelength selec-
tion. Both the distribution of Simpson et al. (2014) and
Miettinen et al. (2015) follow these predictions, although
the distributions selected around 850 µm put some strain
on the models, as they are peaking at slightly lower red-
shifts than predicted. While there may remain some
questions as to the redshift completeness and reliability
of photometric redshifts in the two comparison samples,
we interpret the selection wavelength as the main driver
for the diﬀerence in redshift distributions seen in the bot-
tom panel of Figure 7.

5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have used ALMA in Cycle 1 to determine spectro-
scopic redshifts for strongly lensed DSFGs selected from
the SPT survey. With this data, we conﬁrmed the red-
shifts of six sources with single-line redshifts from Cycle 0
presented in Weiß et al. (2013) and performed a redshift

search for 15 new sources.

Observing in Band 6 for 8–20 minutes per source,
we have measured mid- to high-J CO lines to conﬁrm
previously reported single-line redshifts from Weiß et al.
(2013).
In addition to detecting lines originating from
transitions in CO, we also detected [N II], H2O, H2O+
and NH3. The most probable redshifts (based on one line
plus well sampled photometry) for all but one source were
conﬁrmed to be correct, demonstrating a robust method
to estimate redshifts from a single line and a well mea-
sured dust temperature. This method will be useful for
future blind surveys with ALMA.

We sought redshift identiﬁcation for 15 new sources
selected from a 100 deg2 ﬁeld of the SPT survey with
S1.4mm>16 mJy, by searching for emission lines in ALMA
Band 3. We covered the frequency range 84.2–114.9 GHz
in ﬁve tunings of 2 minutes each, adding up to 10 minutes
of integration per source. Twelve of these sources are de-
tected in continuum and their spectra are extracted. In
four sources, we ﬁnd two or more lines and unambigu-
ously determine the redshift.
In seven sources we ﬁnd
one single line and calculate the most probable redshift
for each of them using their dust temperature. For two
of these sources we detect [C II] with APEX/FLASH and
for two sources we detect CO with APEX/SEPIA, se-
curing their redshift.
In one source we do not see any
lines in the 3 mm ALMA spectrum, but we determine the
redshift from an absorption line detected in our ALMA
Cycle 0 870 µm high resolution imaging cube.

In total, we determine reliable redshifts for 12 sources
targeted in our ALMA Cycle 1 3 mm scans, present a red-
shift found using APEX/Z-Spec, and conﬁrm six single-
line redshifts from Weiß et al. (2013) with our targeted
1 mm scans. Adding this to the already established red-
shifts of SPT-DSFGs gives a ﬁnal sample of 39 sources
with spectroscopic redshifts. The median of the sam-
ple is z=3.9 ± 0.4 with a slightly lower mean of ¯z=3.7.
Unlike redshift distributions selected at slightly shorter
wavelengths, the SPT-DSFG redshift distribution is ﬂat
between z=2.5–5.0 with a large fraction (75%) of the
sample at z>3.

Assuming no size evolution with redshift, we lensing-
correct the redshift distribution by taking into account
the probability of gravitational lensing occurring as a
function of redshift. After correction for lensing, we re-
cover the redshift distribution of DSFGs above z>1.5 and
we ﬁnd a median of z=3.1 ±0.3 for DSFGs selected at 1.4
mm. The redshift distribution and the lensing-corrected
redshift distribution are consistent with the prediction
made by the models of B´ethermin et al. (2015).

By comparing to redshift distributions from the lit-
erature, we show that the selection wavelength is an
important variable to the shape of the redshift distri-
bution. The long selection wavelength (1.4 mm) of the
SPT DSFGs provides a promising way of studying the
z>3 tail of DSFGs, including their most distant (z>5)
counterparts.

This sample of SPT-DSFGs is the most complete
spectroscopic sample of DSFGs in the literature. Be-
sides studying the redshift distribution of DSFGs,
spectroscopic redshifts are an important ﬁrst step for
future detailed studies of the ISM at high redshifts (e.g.,
Aravena et al. 2013; Bothwell et al. 2013; Gullberg et al.
2015; Spilker et al. 2015).
In the future, we will work

towards our goal of obtaining redshifts for the complete
sample of 100 SPT-DSFGs, which will enable detailed
studies of the ISM over cosmic time.

APPENDIX

A. SUPPLEMENTARY REDSHIFT INFORMATION ON SOURCES FROM WEIß et al. 2013

We show here the supplementary observations that resolve redshift ambiguities in the ALMA observations from

Weiß et al. (2013) and go through the lines found in the ALMA 1 mm observations.

SPT0125-50: The most likely redshift option from Weiß et al. (2013) was conﬁrmed by an H2O absorption line
from our ALMA 870 µm high resolution imaging cube for this source, presented by Spilker et al. (2014), along with
a CO(10–9) detection at 232.35 GHz and H2O emission lines from the ALMA 1 mm data. These detections identify
the original ALMA lines as CO(4–3) and [C I] at redshift z=3.959(3). We only clearly see one H2O line, as one line
blends with the CO line and one is at the edge of the spectrum.

SPT0300-46:

In Weiß et al. (2013), one line was detected and one tentative line feature was seen. The most
likely line identiﬁcation was found to be CO(4–3) and [C I] with a redshift of z=3.5954(7). This was conﬁrmed by
observations of [C II] with APEX, presented in Gullberg et al. (2015), along with the CO(10–9) line at 250.71 GHz
and the H2O+(111 − 100, J3=1/2−1/2) absorption line at 247.97 GHz in the ALMA 1 mm spectrum.

SPT0319-47: Weiß et al. (2013) present this source as having no lines though the ALMA 3 mm spectrum shows
a wide (FWHM∼1700 km s−1) tentative line at 104.39 GHz, with the most probable identiﬁcation being CO(5–4) at
z=4.516(4). The redshift was conﬁrmed by the CO(12–11) line at 250.77 GHz in the 1 mm ALMA spectrum. In this
source we have also detected [C II] with APEX/FLASH, see Figure 9.

SPT0441-46: The redshift of this source was conﬁrmed with APEX/FLASH [C II] observations before the publi-
cation of Weiß et al. (2013), but it was not conﬁrmed by the submission of the targeted 1 mm redshift conﬁrmation
proposal. This source had two likely redshift options and it was therefore observed in two tunings. In the 1 mm data
we see a double peaked CO(11–10) line at 231.19 GHz and a double peaked H2O(220 − 211) line at 224.33 GHz. We
also detect NH3, in the form of NH3(20 − 10).

SPT0457-49: Weiß et al. (2013) did not ﬁnd any lines in this source and assumed it was in the redshift desert.
With ATCA we have scanned the redshift range 1.77<z<2.05 searching for CO(1–0) without success (see Figure 10).
We are no closer to determining the spectroscopic redshift of this source, though it is clear that its redshift cannot
be assumed to lie in the redshift desert as suggested by Weiß et al. (2013) and with zphot=3.4±0.6 it probably does not.

SPT0459-58: Weiß et al. (2013) present a single line with two almost equally likely redshift options for this source.
The highest redshift option at z=4.856(4) with the line identiﬁcation CO(5–4) was conﬁrmed by the CO(11–10) line
at 216.36 GHz in the 1 mm ALMA spectrum.

SPT0512-59: One line with two possible identiﬁcations is presented by Weiß et al. (2013). The most likely of
these, CO(3–2) at z=2.2331(2), was conﬁrmed by the detection of [C II] with SPIRE FTS, presented by Gullberg et al.

(2015). This source was also observed with ALMA at 1 mm where we detected the CO(6–5) line at 213.89 GHz and
at this high resolution the lens is resolved, see Figure 11. The red contours mark 5,7 and 9 σ. We extracted the
spectrum where we found the highest SNR.

SPT0550-53: A single line with two possible identiﬁcations was presented for this source in Weiß et al. (2013),
where the most likely line identiﬁcation, CO(4–3) at z=3.1280(7) was conﬁrmed by a [C II] detection from APEX (see
Gullberg et al. 2015), along with a double peaked CO(8–7) line at 223.31 GHz and a double peaked H2O(202 − 111)
line at 239.36 GHz in the 1 mm ALMA spectrum.

SPT0551-50: This source was presented by Weiß et al. (2013) as a having a secure redshift of z=2.1232(2).
This was based on a combination of a line in the ALMA 3 mm spectrum identiﬁed as CO(3–2) and a VLT CIV line.
The source has since been followed up on with several facilities: Gullberg et al. (2015) present a [C II] non-detection
observed with Herschel/SPIRE FTS and CO(1–0) observations with ATCA also showed a non-detection (see the
right panel of Figure 12). APEX/SHeFi observations of the CO(6–5) yielded a detection though (see left panel
of Figure 12), these data will be presented by Gullberg et al. in prep. We investigated the possibility of the VLT
line belonging to a foreground system and left it out of the redshift predictions following here. This opens up the
option for the ALMA 3 mm CO line to be identiﬁed as CO(4–3) and the APEX/SHeFi CO line to be CO(8–7) at
z=3.1638(3). The shift in frequency would be so small between the previous CO(6–5) identiﬁcation and the new

18

Strandet, M. et al.

CO(8–7) identiﬁcation that we would not be able to detect the diﬀerence with the spectral resolution of APEX/SHeFI.
The photometry strongly favors the redshift z=3.1638(3) for which we ﬁnd the dust temperature Tdust=37±1 K
whereas the lower redshift option yields a dust temperature of Tdust=27±1 K. The photometric redshift for this
source is zphot=3.1±0.6. This redshift option was conﬁrmed by the detection of [C II] with APEX/FLASH, see Figure 9.

SPT2132-58: The redshift for this source was already conﬁrmed by the time of publication of Weiß et al. (2013)
through [C II] observations with APEX but it had already been included in the ALMA 1 mm follow up project, where
we then detected CO(12–11) at 239.59 GHz and [N II] at 253.32 GHz.

B. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION FOR NEW SOURCES PRESENTED IN THIS WORK

Below we discuss the eight individual cases which have zero or one CO line detected in the new ALMA 3 mm data
along with SPT2357-51 for which we have additional optical observations. We also show the [C II] spectra obtained
with APEX/FLASH and present an APEX/Z-Spec spectrum that was used to ﬁnd the redshift of SPT0551-48 for
which we do not have ALMA observations.

SPT0002-52: We detect a single line at 103.19 GHz, which turned out to be CO(3–2) at z=2.3510(2)
(Tdust=42±2 K). This was conﬁrmed with APEX/SEPIA where we detected the CO(5–4) line at 171.97 GHz, see
Figure 13.

SPT0551-48: This source was not in the ALMA redshift search. Instead a redshift search was performed with
APEX/Z-Spec, see Figure 14 for the spectrum and Section 2.5 for a description of the data. In the spectrum we ﬁnd
at least four lines, CO(7–6), CO(8–7), [C I](2–1) and H2O. Furthermore the CO(1–0) line was detected for this source
using ATCA and improving the precision on the redshift, ﬁnding z=2.5833(2) (Aravena et al. (2015).).

SPT2307-50: In this source we ﬁnd a weak line at 112.30 GHz. We exclude the line identiﬁcation CO(5–4) at
z=4.132(4), as we would see CO(4–3) in the observing window. If the line is CO(4–3) at z=3.105(2), the CO(3–2) line
would fall just below the frequency range of the observing window. When the spectrum is smoothed as in Figure 13
we do not see anything, but when investigating the edge of the spectrum unsmoothened, we ﬁnd indication for the rise
of a line. Figure 13 shows the possible side of the CO(3–2) line overlaid on the CO(4–3) line. Since this is not a clear
detection we still consider the line identiﬁcation CO(3–2) at z=2.079(1) which would have Tdust=25±3 K. CO(2–1)
at z=1.052(1) is ruled out since the dust temperature (Tdust=16±1 K) would be too low. The most probable line
identiﬁcation based on the photometric redshift zphot=3.4±0.9 is CO(4–3) which would then have a dust temperature
of Tdust=36±4 K.

SPT2335-53: We detect a line at 100.12 GHz and a tentative feature at 85.51 GHz, which turns out to be CO(5–4)
and [C I] at z=4.755(1). This was conﬁrmed by a [C II] detection from APEX/FLASH, see Figure 13. At this redshift
we ﬁnd a dust temperature of Tdust=57±4 K.

SPT2340-59: This source splits up into two counterparts in the ALMA 3 mm continuum image. In our 870 µm
high resolution ALMA imaging, we see the same two counterparts (see Figure 15). Counterpart B is brightest, but
in the spectrum of this we do not see any lines. In counterpart A, however, we see a potential line at 94.79 GHz. If
this line is real the possible line identiﬁcations are CO(3–2) at z=2.6480(8), CO(4–3) at z=3.864(1) or CO(5–4) at
z=5.079(1). CO(2–1) at z=1.4321(5) is excluded as that would mean a dust temperature of Tdust=17±1 K, which
has not been observed in any of our sources. The photometric redshift of the source is zphot=3.8±0.7 favoring the
CO(4–3) line identiﬁcation. For this redshift though, the [C I] line falls within the spectral window. With the low
SNR of the CO line, it is reasonable to assume that the [C I] line is hiding within the noise.

SPT2349-50: In this source we see a single bright line at 89.21 GHz with the most probable line identiﬁcation
being CO(3–2) at z=2.8764(3). This was conﬁrmed by APEX/SEPIA observations of the CO(7–6) line at 207.99 GHz.

SPT2349-56: At 3 mm, this source splits into two counterparts, but in the 870 µm high resolution ALMA imaging
(Vieira et al. 2013) we see three counterparts (see Figure 15). We use the high resolution imaging to deﬁne the
positions for the three counterparts and extract spectra there. We see indications of a line at ∼87.0GHz all positions
(with the center slightly shifted at each position), with position A showing the weakest line. When the spectra of
these three positions are stacked we see a hint of a line at 108.62GHz. These two lines are consistent with the line
identiﬁcations CO(4–3) and CO(5–4) at z=4.306(?) which is conﬁrmed by APEX/FLASH [C II] observations. The
[C II] only traces part of the line seen in the stack (see Figure 13), so in Figure 16 we show the spectra of each of the
components with [C II] overlaid. It is clear from this that the [C II] traces component C.

SPT2353-50: We detect a single wide spectral feature at 87.63 GHz. We rule out the line identiﬁcation CO(2–1)
at z=1.630(2) and CO(3–2) at z=2.945(2) because the dust temperatures would be Tdust=16±1 K and Tdust=25±2 K
respectively. The photometric redshift zphot=4.5±0.8 favors the line identiﬁcation CO(4–3) at z=4.261(3). The last

shown with a grey histogram is given. Other CO lines are overlaid in pink, [C I] lines are overlaid in blue and lines obtained with APEX
are overlaid in red and the instrument is given with the line name. All ALMA lines are shown at their true ﬂux density, but the lines
observed with APEX/SEPIA and APEX/FLASH have been scaled so they could be shown in the same plot. Note that both the velocity
axis and the ﬂux density axis varies over the sources as they have been adjusted to better show the lines. For SPT2307-50, the CO(3-2)
line is at the edge of the spectrum, which is why it stops mid-line. Four sources (SPT2307-50, SPT2340-59, SPT2349-50, SPT2349-56) still
have ambiguous redshifts and are here shown at their most probable redshift. For details on the sources, see the source description in this
Appendix.

possible line identiﬁcation is CO(5–4) at z=5.576(4) which is not negligible with a dust temperature of Tdust=46±2 K.
At this redshift, CO(6–5) falls within the spectral window, and we see a SNR∼1.5 feature at the frequency where the
line should fall. This redshift option was conﬁrmed by the detection of [C II], see Figure 13.

SPT2354-58: This is the only source where we do not ﬁnd any lines in the 3 mm ALMA redshift search. For
this source we have high resolution 870 µm imaging and in this data cube we found an absorption line at 338.95 GHz
(see left panel of Figure 17). We identify the line as either OH+(122 – 011) at z=1.867(1) or H2O(110 − 101) at
z=0.6431(3). For other absorptions line identiﬁcations we should have seen an emission line in the 3 mm ALMA data.
The ﬁrst option is favored by the photometry with Tdust=43±2 K compared to Tdust=27±1 K for the second option.
Furthermore we should have seen CO(5–4) at 350.77 GHz if the second option was correct and this is not the case
(see right panel of Figure 17). The most probable redshift is therefore identiﬁed as z=1.867(1).

SPT2357-51: For this source optical spectroscopy with the X-shooter/VLT was performed before the ALMA
observations, detecting a line. The observations are described in Section 2.7 and the spectrum is shown in Figure 18.

Figure 15. 3 mm continuum imaging of the two sources that split up in to multiple components scaled by the rms (which is rms=0.05mJy
for both sources). The contours are high resolution 870 µm ALMA high resolution imaging, 5,10,20,30σ. Left: SPT2340-59 which splits up
in to two counterparts, with the peak ﬂux density of Speak=0.30 mJy. Right: SPT2349-56 splits into three at 870 µm, with the peak ﬂux
density of Speak=0.22 mJy.

In this Appendix we show Table 4 which contains the values obtained from the photometric observations described

in Section 2.6.

D. THE SPECTRAL ENERGY DISTRIBUTION OF A NON-DETECTION

Figure 19 shows the SED of SPT2344-51. The photometry of this source indicated that this high-redshift source
would be bright enough for detection at our 3 mm sensitivity, but we did not detect it. Since the ALMA Cycle 1

with OH+ as the most likely line identiﬁcation. Right: Where CO(5–4) would have been if the redshift is z=0.6431(3).

Figure 18. UV/Optical/near-IR spectra (VLT/X-shooter) of the z=3.07 identiﬁed SPT2357-51. The redshift was identiﬁed with large
equivalent width Lyman-α emission in the UV, exhibiting a strong, broad emission line (FWHM = 1230 km/s) but no detectable continuum.
The broad Lyα line is suggestive of an AGN, although no CIV

are detected.

Note. — The uncertainties do not include absolute calibration errors. The 2 mm and 1.4 mm SPT ﬂux densities are deboosted.

deadline we detected this source with APEX/LABOCA and using this point with β=2, which is what we use in our
SED ﬁts when ﬁnding photometric redshifts (dashed line), the SED shows that we should detect the source at 3 mm.
When we instead force the SED to go through the SPT points (β=4) then the SED falls below the detection limit.
This is however, a steeper slope than we would expect. This upper limit is assuming an unresolved source. If the
source is smeared over two or more beams the ﬂux density per beam could easily be too low to be detected.
