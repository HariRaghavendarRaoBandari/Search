Mean square displacements of hydrogen atoms in glass-forming materials and proteins, as re-
ported by incoherent elastic neutron scattering, show kinks in their temperature dependence. This
crossover, known as the dynamical transition, connects two approximately linear regimes. It is often
assigned to the dynamical freezing of subsets of molecular modes at the point of equality between
their corresponding relaxation times and the instrumental observation window. The origin of the
dynamical transition in glass-forming glycerol is studied here by extensive molecular dynamics sim-
ulations. We ﬁnd the dynamical transition to occur for both the center of mass translations and the
molecular rotations at the same temperature, insensitive to changes of the observation window. Both
the translational and rotational dynamics of glycerol show a dynamic crossover from the structural
to a secondary relaxation at the temperature of the dynamical transition. A signiﬁcant and discon-
tinuous increase in the orientational Kirkwood factor and in the dielectric constant is observed in
the same range of temperatures. We, however, do not ﬁnd any indications of a true thermodynamic
transition to an ordered low-temperature phase. We therefore suggest that all observed crossovers
are dynamic in character. The increase in the dielectric constant is related to the dynamic freezing
of dipolar domains on the time-scale of simulations.

INTRODUCTION

Displacements of atoms and molecules induced by ther-
mal agitation generally increase with temperature. A
linear growth of the mean-squared displacement (MSD)
with increasing temperature is predicted by the Nyquist
(ﬂuctuation-dissipation) theorem [1, 2]. The MSD is ex-
perimentally extracted from either the intermediate scat-
tering function of the neutron scattering experiment [3]
or from the fraction of recoilless γ-ray emission of the 57Fe
nucleus in the M¨ossbauer experiment [4, 5]. The Nyquist
theorem was found to be violated for a number of glass-
forming materials, where a kink in the MSD vs. temper-
ature is often observed at the laboratory glass transition
[6]. More complex behavior, with several kinks [7–9], was
observed for proteins in partially hydrated powders or in
the polycrystalline form [10, 11].

A typical temperature dependence of the protein MSD
starts with the linear increase in accord with the Nyquist
theorem and the corresponding vibrational density of
states [11, 12].
It is followed by one or two low-
temperature crossovers and, ﬁnally, with a much stronger
increase above the temperature of the dynamical transi-
tion Td ∼ 200 − 250 K [13]. This latter temperature
depends on a number of factors, including the resolution
of the spectrometer, i.e., eﬀectively the time period over
which the atomic displacements are recorded [14, 15].
This phenomenology has attracted signiﬁcant attention
since enhanced ﬂexibility and, therefore, the ability to
perform biological function can develop at T > Td [16].

A somewhat unexpected observation came recently

∗Electronic address: dmitrym@asu.edu

from Capaccioli et al
[17], who presented two key ob-
servations based on the analysis of a large database
of neutron scattering data accumulated so far: (i) the
MSD measured in 50:50 lysozyme-glycerol mixture can
be nearly seamlessly overlaid with corresponding mea-
surements for the pure glycerol and (ii) there are two
crossover temperatures common to lysozyme-glycerol
and glycerol systems, at Td ≃ 210 and 276 K.

The ﬁrst observation is signiﬁcant for assigning the
modes of the protein-solvent system responsible for the
protein’s extended ﬂexibility at high temperatures. High
protein ﬂexibility is required for its biological action
[4, 18, 19], and this perspective connects protein func-
tion with speciﬁc physical modes and ﬂuctuations of the
protein-solvent system [20]. Frauenfelder and co-workers
suggested that the solvent mode coupled to the protein
atomic displacements has to be attributed to the hy-
dration shell [21, 22]. They also noted that this mode
is decoupled from the α-relaxation of the bulk solvent
(structural or collective relaxation with the longest re-
laxation time and usually connected to the liquid viscos-
ity). The relaxation time of the hydration shell is both
faster than α-relaxation and is Arrhenius, with the acti-
vation energy usually smaller than that of α-relaxation.
Taken together, these features point to its β-character
in the established classiﬁcation of glass science [23, 24].
Since secondary β-relaxation processes exist also in the
bulk solvent, the ﬂuctuations localized in the hydration
shell of the protein are classiﬁed as βh-relaxation and are
expected to carry the dynamics distinct from the bulk
[25]. The dynamical transition then occurs when the βh-
relaxation of the hydration shell slows suﬃciently down,
with lowering temperature, to become longer than the
instrumental time-scale (dynamical freezing) [26, 27].

The observation of a near-equivalence of MSDs

recorded by neutron scattering in lysozyme-glycerol and
pure glycerol systems puts under question the hydration-
shell hypothesis, or at least the part of it attributing β-
relaxation speciﬁcally to the shell, in contrast to a faster
relaxation mode of the bulk (of presumably β-character).
The question posed by this observation is whether the
modes of the solvent coupled with protein ﬂexibility are
hydration-shell speciﬁc or generic to the bulk material.
Furthermore, since the dynamical transition is a general
phenomenon common to glass-forming materials, includ-
ing molecular liquids and biopolymers [6], the question
here is what are the modes that experience dynamical
freezing at Td and whether the instrumental resolution
must necessarily be a part of the explanation. Address-
ing some of these mechanistic questions is a goal of this
study.

In order to avoid the complexities of protein solutions,
we address these basic questions by focusing solely on
bulk glycerol, for which we report here extensive molecu-
lar dynamics (MD) simulations. The temperature depen-
dence of hydrogen MSDs is analyzed in terms of separate
contributions of the center of mass translations and rota-
tions relative to the center of mass of the molecule. Both
translational and rotational MSDs show a crossover at
the same temperature Td ∼ 275 K consistent with ex-
perimental data. The temperature of translational and
rotational dynamical transitions does not change when
the observation time is signiﬁcantly altered. We also ﬁnd
that the same temperature characterizes the dynamic
crossover from α to β relaxation as measured by glyc-
erol’s diﬀusivity and rotational dynamics.

The consistent picture arising from our observations
is that a structural crossover occurs in glycerol at ∼
250 − 275 K, which aﬀects both the MSDs and relaxation
times. However, there is no indication from our data
that this crossover should be identiﬁed with a true ther-
modynamic transition. We therefore suggest that all ob-
served crossovers are dynamical in character. In partic-
ular, the structural crossover to a low-temperature state
of glycerol, characterized by long-ranged dipolar correla-
tions, becomes possible because these collective correla-
tions cannot relax on the limited observation time. The
dynamical transition in the MSD recorded by neutron
scattering is not the result of crossing of the time-scale
of single-particle translational/rotational diﬀusion with
the observation time-scale, but rather the crossing of the
latter with the time-scale of multi-body relaxation of po-
larized domains. A corresponding signiﬁcant increase in
the orientational Kirkwood factor and the jump in the
dielectric constant at low temperatures are caused, in
our simulations, by the crossing of the relaxation time of
dipolar domains and the observation (simulation) time.
This phenomenology is similar to that of relaxor ferro-
electrics where dynamic freezing of ferroelectric domains
is responsible for the high dielectric constant of the low-
temperature phase [28].

INCOHERENT NEUTRON SCATTERING

The experimental MSDs are extracted from incoher-
ent elastic neutron scattering. The reported signals are
aﬀected by the instrumental resolution function convolut-
ing with the dynamic structure factor S(q, ω), for which
we assume the scattering momentum q directed along the
x-axis of the laboratory frame. The function S(q, ω) is
the time Fourier transform of the intermediate scattering
function

I(q, t) = N −1Xj

heiq∆xj (t)i,

(1)

where ∆xj = xj (t) − xj(0) is the displacement of a hy-
drogen atom and the sum runs over N hydrogen atoms
in the system; h. . . i denotes an ensemble average.

In what follows we will consider all hydrogens in the
system identical, although we will separate two groups of
hydrogens of glycerol: 3 hydroxyl hydrogens and 5 hy-
drogens bonded to carbon atoms. Correspondingly, ex-
perimental results for partially deuterated glycerol [29]
C3H5(OD)3 (g-d3) and C3D5(OH)3 (g-d5) will be ana-
lyzed by considering the corresponding groups of hydro-
gen atoms not substituted by deuteration.

The intensity of the elastic scattering function at ω =
0 gives access to the MSD [3, 29]. The corresponding
function S(q, ω = 0, ∆ω), depending on the resolution
window of the spectrometer ∆ω, can be approximated
by I(q, tr) ≃ S(q, ω = 0, ∆ω), where the resolution time
tr is related to the resolution window of the spectrometer.
According to Doster et al [30], the connection is tr/ps =
1.09/Γ(meV), where Γ is the width at half maximum of
the resolution function.

The intermediate scattering function in Eq. (1) can
be estimated in the Gaussian approximation [31], which
leads to

− ln [I(q, t)] ≃ q2h(δx)2i − q2hδx(t)δx(0)i.

(2)

If the time autocorrelation function hδx(t)δx(0)i, δx(t) =
x(t)−hxi decays suﬃciently to zero on the resolution time
tr, the second term in Eq. (2) disappears and one gets an
estimate of the mean square ﬂuctuation (MSF) h(δx)2i
from the linear slope of − ln(I(q, tr)) vs q2 [29, 32]. Oth-
erwise one obtains half of the MSD (1/2)h∆x(tr)2i from
the slope of − ln(I(q, tr)) vs q2.

The data presented here were obtained from extensive
MD simulations of glycerol described by the OPLS-AA
force ﬁeld [33] as explained in Appendix A. Our main
purpose in the analysis of the intermediate scattering
function is to extract the relative contributions to the ob-
served MSD arising from center of mass translations and
molecular rotations relative to the center of mass. The
question that we address here is whether the dynamical
transition, if observed, occurs at the same temperature
for these two modes. In addition to general mechanistic
insights that such an analysis can produce, this question
is relevant to testing the idea of dynamical freezing of a

subset of molecular motions as the reason for the exper-
imentally observed kink in the dependence of the MSD
on temperature [10, 11, 13, 14], identiﬁed with Td. If the
kink is caused by reaching the equality between the re-
laxation time and the instrumental observation window
[14], the dynamical transition temperature should be dif-
ferent for translations and rotations having their distinct
relaxation times, unless they happen to be close. This is
not what we observe from our simulations: the dynam-
ical transition temperatures are the same for rotations
and translations when calculated from ﬁtting the inter-
mediate scattering function to Eq. (2) (Fig. 1).

The separation of the center of mass translations and
rotations relative to the center of mass assumes the fac-
torization of the intermediate scattering function into the
translational, IT (q, t), and rotational, IR(q, t), compo-
nents

I(q, t) = IT (q, t)IR(q, t).

(3)

We therefore calculated IT (q, t) and IR(q, t) separately
and produced the linear ﬁts of the corresponding func-
tions vs q2 with tr = 25 ps for both g-d3 and g-d5 liq-
uids. No deuteration was actually performed in simu-
lations and only the corresponding groups of hydrogen
atoms were selected to produce the intermediate scatter-
ing functions.

The accuracy of translation/rotation factorization in
Eq. (3) was tested previouly and is usually found to

hold [34–36]. Indeed, one expects this separation to be
accurate in the Gaussian limit since translations and
rotations carry diﬀerent symmetry.
If one separates
∆x(t) = ∆xc(t) + ∆xR(t) into the center of mass dis-
placement ∆xc(t) and the rotation relative to the center
of mass ∆xR(t), the MSD becomes the sum of two self
terms and the translational-rotational cross term

h∆x(t)2i = h∆xc(t)2i + h∆xR(t)2i + 2h∆xc(t)∆xR(t)i.
(4)
Figure 2 shows an example of the analysis of the three
correlation components in Eq. (4) from MD simulations.
The translational and rotational components of the MSD
are close in magnitude, while the cross-correlation is neg-
ative and is much smaller.

The translational and rotational MSDs are shown sep-
arately in Fig. 1 to indicate the common point of the kink
at Td ∼ 275 K. The same temperature of the dynamical
transition is reported experimentally [17, 29]. However,
the absolute values of MSDs from experiment (closed di-
amonds in Fig. 1) are below the simulation results, which
is easy to see from the plot since the overall MSD follows
from adding up the translational and rotational compo-
nents (Eq. (4)). The most probable explanation of this
discrepancy is that ﬁtting the experimental neutron scat-
tering data in a limited range q-values used in the mea-
surements [29] allows one to probe only a limited subset
of motions [37, 38], presumably the translational diﬀu-
sion.
Indeed, the agreement between simulations and
experiment for the center of mass MSD is quite good.
We also note that the agreement between the calculated
coeﬃcient of self-diﬀusion of glycerol and the results of
measurements by NMR [39] is also reasonable (Fig. 6 be-
low).

The time dependence of MSDs shown in Fig. 2 also
helps to understand the physical origin of MSDs recorded
by neutron scattering. Both the translational and ro-
tational components of the MSDs are characterized by
two distinct regimes: a fast (∼ 1 ps) growth due to
ballistic motions in the liquid’s cage (localized diﬀusion
[40]), followed by a much slower, long-range diﬀusion
with h∆x(t)2i ∝ t. The main observation here is that

most of the MSD on the resolution time-scale tr ∼ 25 ps
is caused by the ballistic displacement associated with a
secondary relaxation and not by the diﬀusional motion
associated with the primary relaxation process. This con-
clusion holds both below and above Td (Figs. 2 and 3).
The increase of the observation window from 25 ps to
135 ps makes the time spent by the particle on the lin-
ear, diﬀusion portion of the MSD longer (Fig. 2) and thus
increases the slope of the high temperature part of the
MSD curve (Fig. 4). It is important to realize that fast
cage dynamics, resulting to the main portion of the ob-
served MSD, are much faster than the resolution time tr
and in fact become even faster with lowering tempera-
ture because of a greater rigidity of the low-temperature
glycerol. It is the amplitude of the ballistic displacement
which gets larger with increasing temperature, resulting
in the observed temperature dependence of the MSD.
The crossing of the resolution time of the spectrometer
(25 ps) and the relaxation time of these ballistic mo-
tions never occurs and, therefore, the kink in the MSD
vs temperature cannot be attributed to the ﬁnite resolu-
tion time.

The change of the form of the MSD vs T with the
changing observation window tr is shown in Fig. 4.
It
adds additional evidence to the suggestion that the kink
in the MSD’s temperature dependence is not caused by
the equality between the relaxation time and the obser-

4

vation window. While the high-temperature portion of
the MSD has a steeper slope for a higher tr, in agreement
with experiment [17], the temperature of the dynamical
transition Td has little sensitivity to tr. In addition, the
equality between the dynamical transition temperatures
for the translational and rotational MSDs is preserved
between tr = 25 ps and tr = 135 ps. If one assumes that
the consistency in Td for tr = 25 ps shown in Fig. 1 is a
mere coincidence, it is hard to see how it can be preserved
at tr = 135 ps. One has to accept the conclusion that the
kink in the MSD is not related to the observation window
[32, 41] and, instead, should be attributed to the soft-
ening of the liquid cage, with increasing temperature, in
which a glycerol molecule ﬁnds itself for a relatively short
time of ∼ 1 ps. The rattling inside the cage is followed
by an escape and the onset of long-range diﬀusion, but
this component simply adds to the main displacement
achieved by the ballistic cage rattling. The next question
is whether structural distinctions of the entire liquid pro-
ducing the diﬀerence between the low-temperature rigid
cage and the high-temperature soft cage can be identi-
ﬁed.

III. DYNAMIC CROSSOVER

An explanation alternative to the instrumental reso-
lution eﬀect for the appearance of the kink in the pro-
ton MSD involves the dynamic crossover, i.e., a corre-
sponding kink in the dependence of the system relaxation
time on the inverse temperature [42]. This phenomenol-
ogy, known as the fragile-to-strong transition in glass sci-
ence [23], represents the crossover from the structural α-
relaxation at high temperatures above the crossover to
a secondary β-relaxation at low temperature below the
crossover. Correspondingly, the activation barrier of the
high-temperature α-relaxation is higher than the acti-
vation barrier of the low-temperature β-relaxation. We
show below that this phenomenon is not connected to
the kink in the MSD reported by neutron scattering and,
at least in our simulations, has a trivial explanation of
slower dynamics exceeding in its relaxation time the ob-
servation window (simulation time in the case of MD).

The problem of dynamic crossover in conﬁned wa-
ter has been extensively studied [38, 43, 44] and it has
been established that the temperature of the dynamic
crossover of conﬁned water is generally consistent with
Td of proteins [42, 45]. The temperature Td was also
found to be independent of the protein hydration level
[41, 45, 46] even though the relaxation times themselves
are strongly aﬀected by hydration. This latter observa-
tion points to the connection between Td and some sort
of structural change in conﬁned water.

The dynamic crossover results for water are necessarily
limited to conﬁned systems since bulk water is unstable
to nucleation below ≃ 243 K [44, 47]. Since our present
simulations apply to bulk glycerol, it would be of sig-
niﬁcant interest to establish a phenomenology similar to

that found for conﬁned water for a material available in
bulk phase both in simulations and in the laboratory ex-
periment.

It is useful to start oﬀ with an estimate of how the
dynamic crossover in the relaxation time can poten-
tially aﬀect the MSD measured on the resolution time
tr. This can be illustrated for the rotational MSD,
which can be rewritten in terms of the rotational MSF
h(δxR)2i = hx2
Ri − hxRi2 and the normalized autocorre-
lation function of rotations φR(t)

h∆xR(t)2i = 2h(δxR)2i [1 − φR(t)] ,

where

φR(t) = h(δxR)2i−1hδxR(t)δxR(0)i.

(5)

(6)

The generic form of φR(t) is the initial ballistic (Gaus-
sian) decay, followed by exponential collective relaxation:
φR(t) = Ag exp[−(t/τg)2] + (1 − Ag) exp[−t/τR] (or, al-
ternatively, multi-exponential or stretched exponential
term) [2].
In the entire temperature range studied for
glycerol we ﬁnd that tr falls between the time of ballis-
tic relaxation τg and the time of collective exponential
relaxation τR: τg ≪ tr ≪ τR. One therefore gets

h∆xR(t)2i ≃ 2h(δxR)2i [Ag + (1 − Ag)(tr/τR)] .

(7)

In the limit of tr ≪ τR, the relaxation time is not ex-
pected to aﬀect the MSD. Its magnitude is mostly de-
termined by the amplitude of the Gaussian component
of the relaxation dynamics, in agreement with the argu-
ments presented in relation to Figs. 2 and 3. Therefore,
if the dynamic crossover and the kink of the MSD occur
at the same temperature [45] one has to relate this coin-
cidence to a structural change and not to a direct eﬀect
of the relaxation time on the MSD. The hypothesis that
the crossover in the relaxation time aﬀects the MSD is,
therefore, not supported by our simulation results.

where X = R corresponds to the normalized time cor-
relation function in Eq. (6). These results are shown by
the open points in Fig. 5.

We have additionally calculated the time correlation
function φE(t) ∝ hδE(t) · δE(0)i based on the dynamic
variable of the electric ﬁeld produced by the rest of the
glycerol liquid at the center of mass of a given target
molecule (X = E). The microscopic electric ﬁeld E(t)
is therefore a ﬂuctuating local ﬁeld producing a torque
on the glycerol’s dipole moment. The results for the av-
erage relaxation times obtained from the corresponding
time correlation functions through Eq. (8) are shown by
the closed points in Fig. 5. There is a good agreement
between τR and τE suggesting that the electric ﬁeld ﬂuc-
tuations are caused by molecular rotations, as one would
anticipate from the standard Debye model of dielectric
relaxation [48, 50].

The average relaxation times from MD simulations are
compared in Fig. 5 with the average relaxation time cal-
culated from the Cole-Davidson ﬁt of glycerol’s loss spec-
trum reported by broad-band dielectric spectroscopy [49]
(solid line). There is a very good agreement between the
simulations and experimental dielectric data at high tem-
peratures, suggesting that the adopted force ﬁeld [33] (see
Appendix A) is well parametrized for glycerol rotations.
There is a less satisfactory agreement between the dif-
fusion coeﬃcient calculated from MD and measured by
NMR (Fig. 6). Diﬀerences between quasi-elastic neutron
scattering (QENS) and NMR/viscosity data for glycerol
self-diﬀusion have been documented in the past [40, 51]
and might contribute to the discrepancy.

The dynamic crossover occurs in the range of temper-
atures when the α-relaxation time becomes comparable
to the length of the simulation trajectory τsim ≃ 50 ns.

linear ﬁts to the corresponding subsets of data to guide the
eye. The Kirkwood factors in (a) were obtained both in NVE
and NVT separate simulation runs.

In fact, the time window τcalc on which the time corre-
lation function φX (t) is calculated from the simulation
trajectories is always shorter, τcalc < τsim. We therefore
stop observing the slow relaxation in simulations when
the α-relaxation time becomes longer than τcalc. The
relative weight of the fast relaxation in hτ i increases and
we observe this as a dynamical crossover.

What our data do not seem to address is why the kinks
in the rotational and translational MSDs and the corre-
sponding dynamical crossovers in the rotational relax-
ation times and translational diﬀusion (Figs. 5 and 6)
all occur in the same range of temperatures. A possi-
ble scenario to explain this coincidence might include a
structural transition resulting in a drop of the conﬁgura-
tional entropy [53]. According to the general arguments
based on the Adam-Gibbs relation [23], this would result
in a much slower main relaxation process, which would
sharply disappear from the observation window of our
numerical experiment. While our results presented be-
low do support alteration of glycerol’s orientational struc-
ture, we do not have a direct evidence for a discontinuous
change in the conﬁgurational entropy.

In order to identify possible structural changes, we
have looked at the temperature dependence of the Kirk-
wood factor reﬂecting orientational correlations in the
liquid

Here, ˆem are the unit vectors of molecular dipoles (4.6 D

force ﬁeld is non-polarizable and the refractive index is
equal to unity). The results of these calculations are
shown in Fig. 7.

The Kirkwood factor shows a discontinuous increase at
T < 250 K, which results in the corresponding increase of
the dielectric constant calculated from MD simulations.
The increase in gK is caused by the emergence of long-
range orientational correlations of glycerol dipoles at low
temperatures, as is illustrated in Fig. 8. We show there
the projection of the pair correlation function of glyc-
erol h(r, ˆe1, ˆe2), depending on the distance r between two
molecules and their orientations ˆe1 and ˆe2, on the rota-
tional invariant of the scalar product between the unit
vectors of the dipole moments ∆(1, 2) = (ˆe1 · ˆe2). The

It is clear that a long-range oscillatory pattern, reﬂect-
ing preferential parallel alignments of the dipoles, ap-
pears at low temperatures. The dipolar alignments are
responsible for an increase in the low-temperature Kirk-

wood factor, gK = 1 + ρR h∆(r)dr, ρ is the number den-

sity. Despite these long-range orientational correlations,
the low-temperature phase does not show any speciﬁc ori-
entational order, as conﬁrmed by calculations of the ﬁrst

and second orientational order parameters [54, 55] (Fig.
9) as explained below. No translational order is observed
either: the radial pair distribution functions are nearly
identical at low and high temperatures (Fig. 10). We
therefore can conclude that the low-temperature phase
is a disordered liquid.

The orientational order can be detected by orienta-
tional order parameters typically deﬁned for liquid crys-
tals [55]. The order parameter pn is the average nth order

where α and β are the Cartesian projections and δαβ is
the Kronecker delta function. The results of calculations
for the ﬁrst and second order parameters (n = 1, 2) are
shown in Fig. 9. No orientational order can be identiﬁed
at low temperatures from these calculations.

The jump in the simulated dielectric constant is in
stark disagreement with the linear dielectric experiment
[52] where no discontinuities were observed (squares in
Fig. 7b). The results of simulations are in fair agreement
with experiment at high temperatures, but the increase
in the Kirkwood factor at lower temperatures (Fig. 7a)
makes the dielectric constant much higher than obser-
vations. Since the crossover temperature for the dielec-
tric constant is roughly consistent with the kinks in the
rotational and translational MSDs, we conclude that re-
stricting the observation window not only makes changes
to the observable relaxation dynamics, but also does not

allow certain orientational correlations to relax. As a re-
sult, we observe a long-range orientational order frozen
on the observation time-scale. This implies that both the
low-temperature Kirkwood factor and the corresponding
dielectric constant shown in Fig. 7 are non-equilibrium
quantities. A similar, about ﬁve times compared to the
bulk (Fig. 9 in Ref. 56), increase in the dielectric constant
was observed for ultrathin ﬁlms of glycerol obtained by
vapor deposition [57]. Subsequent combined dielectric
and calorimetry measurements have suggested the exis-
tence of rigid polar clusters, which relax as a whole, with
an enhanced cluster dipole moment [56]. There is also
recent evidence of an unrelaxed orientational order in or-
ganic glasses obtained by surface deposition [58].

The existence of highly correlated clusters should be
seen in the heterogeneity of binary correlations expressed
in terms of fourth-order correlation functions [59].
In
order to test this hypothesis, we made the next step
of calculating the distance- and time-dependent corre-
lations between binary dipolar orientational correlations
expressed through the instantaneous Kirkwood factors.
Speciﬁcally, the quantity

cℓ(t) = Xm6=ℓ

ˆeℓ(t) · ˆem(t)

(13)

was constructed at each point of the simulation trajec-
tory to reﬂect the instantaneous binary correlations of
the chosen dipole moment ℓ with all remaining dipoles in
the liquid. Obviously, one has hcℓ(t)i = gK − 1. We then
constructed the distance- and time-dependent correlation
between the local binary correlations as follows

C(r, t) =

V
N 2

m Xℓ,k

hcℓ(0)ck(t)δ (r − rℓ(0) + rk(t))i, (14)

where the average is taken along the simulation trajec-
tory and V is the liquid volume. The normalization of
C(r, 0) relates it to the Kirkwood factor

V −1Z C(r, 0)dr = (5/3)g2

K − 2gK + 1.

(15)

Similarly to h∆(r) in Fig. 8, but signiﬁcantly more pro-
nounced, we observe the rise of long-range heterogeneous
correlations at low temperatures (Fig. 11).

IV. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR

THE PROTEIN DYNAMICAL TRANSITION

We obtained here, by computer simulations, both a
kink in the temperature dependence of the MSD (dy-
namical transition) and the dynamical crossovers in the
relaxation times. Both eﬀects have been observed ex-
perimentally and a link between them has been sug-
gested through some sort of structural transition in the
liquid [42, 44, 46]. The answer to the ongoing discus-
sion of whether a purely dynamical crossover or a struc-
tural transition explains the data might be that both are
present. However, in contrast to the scenarios involving
thermodynamic liquid-liquid transitions, both the struc-
tural and relaxation time crossovers have a dynamic ori-
gin. The structural crossover is caused by the inability of
certain structural correlations to relax on the observation
window. There is nothing in our data that connects the
appearance of such structural correlations to a thermody-
namic transition between two phases of a bulk material.
This distinction becomes, however, less loaded with phys-
ical meaning in the low-temperature state. When the
relaxation time of the “orientationally correlated liquid”
becomes much longer than any conceivable experimen-
tal time, one has to distinguish this state of the material
as an “orientationally correlated glass”, with all relevant
properties distinct from the “ordinary” glass. One ar-
rives at polyamorphism of the glass state [23] caused by
long-ranged orientational correlations.

The observation of an increase in the dielectric con-
stant of glycerol below the dynamical transition, here by
simulations and for vapor deposited glasses experimen-
tally [56, 57], adds a structural component to the stan-
dard picture of ergodicity breaking of glass science. The
standard paradigm is that the glass does not have the
ability to relax, but maintains the structure of the liquid.
This is indeed true for the positional structure of the glyc-
erol molecules. However, the inability of dipolar orien-
tations to relax causes orientational heterogeneity repre-
sented by correlated dipolar clusters, which do not relax
on the observation time-scale. The long-sought growth
of the structural order of glass-formers on approach to
the laboratory glass transition might be, therefore, best
discovered by experiments probing the heterogeneity of
orientational multipolar correlations.

The conclusion that no thermodynamic transformation
is at work in creating dipolar domains does not make our
observations less “interesting”.
In particular, this sce-
nario is relevant to the role of dynamics and structure of
protein’s hydration shells in the protein function. About
anything related to the protein structure and function
has to be described as metastable. Protein itself is un-
stable to either hydrolysis or association, both bringing

8

it to a thermodynamically more stable state [60]. The
function of proteins as enzymes catalyzing speciﬁc bio-
chemical reactions is even more aﬀected by the notion
of a ﬁnite “observation window” [20]. This idea implies
that any dynamical or structural information related to
the protein itself or to its hydration shell has to be consid-
ered from the perspective of a ﬁnite observation window
provided by the reaction rate, i.e., the characteristic time
on which the reactants climb the activation barrier sepa-
rating them from the products. A dynamic process slower
than the rate becomes dynamically frozen and does not
contribute to the ﬂuctuation spectrum of the bath driv-
ing the reaction.

The ability of the solvent to preserve a speciﬁc struc-
ture distinct from its thermodynamic state on a given ob-
servation window immediately implies that an enzymetic
reaction will “see” diﬀerent solvents, with potentially
dramatically diﬀerent properties (such as polarity), de-
pending on the reaction rate. Figure 7 provides a dra-
matic conﬁrmation of this possibility showing the ability
of glycerol to possess a very high dielectric constant due
to its inability to relax its long-range orientational corre-
lations on a given observation window. A related exam-
ple, with a similar phenomenology, is the appearance of
polarized (ferroelectric) domains in the hydration shells
of proteins observed on the time-scale of simulations [61].
Similarly to our present results for glycerol, these do-
mains might well equilibrate to zero overall dipole on
longer time-scales, but a non-zero net dipole of the shell
will be recorded by any kinetic process occurring faster
than the domain relaxation dynamics.

Bulk glycerol studied by linear dielectric spectroscopy
does not display the features indicative of domain forma-
tion. There is a general agreement that linear dielectric
spectroscopy does not directly probe heterogeneity of a
bulk material [48]. However, it might still be illuminat-
ing to ask why the relaxation of oriented domains in the
bulk is not observed by dielectric spectroscopy. One pos-
sible answer to this is that the lifetime of a domain is
smaller than its rotational relaxation time. The domains
dissolve before there is a chance to probe their rotational
relaxation.
Increasing the lifetime of domains, as po-
tentially achieved by surface vapor deposition [56, 57],
might create conditions for observing the large dipole of
the correlated domain.

The identiﬁcation of the MSD crossover with the cage
dynamics, in the combination with nearly identical be-
havior of MSD of glycerol and lysozyme-glycerol [17],
puts under question the need for a special βh relaxation
process of the hydration shell [21, 22, 27] to explain these
data. It appears that fast secondary relaxation of bulk
glycerol (βf in the standard classiﬁcation of glass sci-
ence [62–64]) is suﬃcient to describe the glycerol-protein
system. It does not necessarily mean that the same sit-
uation repeats itself for a hydrated protein, or applies
equally well to the M¨ossbauer experiment with a much
longer resolution time of tr ≃ 140 ns [4]. Some exper-
imental data indeed claim the existence of independent

relaxation processes of the protein hydration shells with
signiﬁcantly slower relaxation times [65, 66]. The resolu-
tion of this claim, however, depends on the water mode
probed by the observations. There is a relatively insignif-
icant slowing down of water’s single-molecule rotational
dynamics in hydration shells [67]. An attempt to ﬁnd a
separate dynamic process in density ﬂuctuations (trans-
lations) probed by depolarized light scattering resulted
in the realization that cross protein-water correlations,
instead of a separate dynamic process, can explain the
data [68]. However, the collective variable of the shell
dipole moment can be characterized as a separate dy-
namic process, which is both signiﬁcantly slower and is
spatially extended into the bulk [69]. From a general per-
spective, a strong perturbation of the forces existing in
the bulk is required for a new dynamic process to appear.
If a signiﬁcant alteration of the hydrogen-bond network
is achieved in the solvation layer, one can expect a sep-
arate dynamic process to show up. The extent of such
network perturbation is where the distinction between
glycerol and water might be found.

Appendix A: Simulation protocol

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed
for twelve diﬀerent temperatures (147, 168, 179, 195, 214,

9

239, 255, 275, 287, 302, 312, 334 K) in a cubic box con-
sisting of 1000 glycerol molecules using the OPLS-AA
(Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulation - All Atoms)
force ﬁeld [70] within the Gromacs [71] simulation pack-
age. The initial box with 1000 glycerol molecules was
downloaded from virtual chemistry website [70, 72]. Af-
ter the initial NPT and NVT equilibration runs, the raw
box was used to produced 50 ns equilibration trajectories
in the NVE ensemble with no constraints. The output
was then used to generate the NVE trajectories.

Each system was initialized with a 300 ps NVT run us-
ing a Nose-Hoover thermostat with H-bonds constrained
followed by a 300 ps run with no constraints. Then a 1-3
ns NVE run was generated to check for stability before
doing the 50 ns production run for each temperature.
The time step for all production runs was 0.5 fs, with all
atoms (including hydrogens) free to move according to
the OPLS-AA force ﬁeld parameters. The group cutoﬀ-
scheme was used with an update time of 5 ns and a cutoﬀ
distance of 1.1 nm for the shifted Lennard-Jones and elec-
trostatic interactions with a group list distance of 13 ˚A
renewing every 10 simulation steps. Long-ranged electro-
static interactions were calculated with the particle mesh
Ewald method. Additional trajectories (tens of ns) were
generated for a separate raw box under the NVT ensem-
ble as a means to compare the results between NVE and
NVT ensembles. These NVT simulations with the H-
bond constraints were equilibrated with an initial 3 ns
run and an additional 3 ns with the constraints removed,
assuring minimization and equilibration before produc-
tion runs for each temperature were executed. The 50 ns
NVT simulations were carried out for temperatures 230,
240, 250, 260, 270, 280 K. In this case, the Verlet cutoﬀ-
scheme was implemented and a Nose-Hoover thermostat
was used. All simulations were carried out using periodic
boundary conditions.
