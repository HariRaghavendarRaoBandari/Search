Abstract

We study the global solution curves, and prove the existence of
inﬁnitely many positive solutions for three classes of self-similar equa-
tions, with p-Laplace operator. In case p = 2, these are well-known
problems involving the Gelfand equation, the equation modeling elec-
trostatic micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and a polynomial
nonlinearity. We extend the classical results of D.D. Joseph and T.S.
Lundgren [8] to the case p 6= 2, and we generalize the main result of Z.
Guo and J. Wei [6] on the equation modeling MEMS.

Key words: Parameterization of the global solution curves, inﬁnitely many
solutions.

Introduction

We consider radial solutions on a ball in Rn for three special classes of equa-
tions, involving the p-Laplace operator, the ones self-similar under scal-
ing. We now explain our approach for one of the classes, involving the
p-Laplace version of the equation which arises in modeling of electrostatic
micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), see [13], [5], [6] (with p > 1,
α > 0, q > 0, u = u(x), x ∈ Rn, n ≥ 1)

0 < u < 1. Radial solutions of this equation satisfy

for 0 < r < 1 ,

u′(0) = u(1) = 0 , 0 < u(r) < 1 ,

with ϕ(v) = v|v|p−2. It is easy to see that u′(r) < 0 for all 0 < r < 1, which
implies that the value of u(0) gives the maximum value (or the L∞ norm) of
our solution. Moreover, u(0) is a global parameter, i.e., it uniquely identiﬁes
the solution pair (λ, u(r)), see e.g., P. Korman [10]. It follows that a two-
dimensional curve in the (λ, u(0)) plane completely describes the solution
set of (1.2). The self-similarity of this equation allows one to parameterize
the global solution curve, using the solution of a single initial value problem:

(1.3)

ϕ(w′)′ +

n − 1

t

ϕ(w′) =

tα
wq , w(0) = 1, w′(0) = 0 .

Its solution w(t) is a positive and increasing function, which can be easily
computed numerically. Following J.A. Pelesko [13], we show that the global
solution curve of (1.2) is given by

(λ, u(0)) =   tα+p

wp+q−1(t)

, 1 −

1

w(t)! ,

parameterized by t ∈ (0, ∞). In particular, λ = λ(t) = tα+p

wp+q−1(t) , and

λ′(t) = tα+p−1w−p−q(cid:2)(α + p)w − t(p + q − 1)w′(cid:3) ,

so that the solution curve travels to the right (left) in the (λ, u(0)) plane if
(α + p)w − t(p + q − 1)w′ > 0 (< 0). This makes us interested in the roots
of the function (α + p)w − t(p + q − 1)w′. If we set this function to zero

(α + p)w − t(p + q − 1)w′ = 0 ,

then the general solution of this equation is

w(t) = ctβ,

β =

α + p

p + q − 1

.

Quite remarkably, if we choose the constant c = c0 = h

then

w0(t) = c0tβ

also solves the equation in (1.3), along with w(t). We show that w(t) tends
to w0(t) as t → ∞, and the solution curve of (1.2) makes inﬁnitely many
turns if and only if w(t) and w0(t) intersect inﬁnitely many times. We give
a sharp condition for that to happen, thus generalizing the main result in
Z. Guo and J. Wei [6] to the case of p 6= 2 (with a simpler proof). In [9] we
called w(t) the generating solution, and w0(t) the guiding solution.

We apply a similar approach to a class of equations with polynomial
f (r, u) generalizing the well-known results of D.D. Joseph and T.S. Lundgren
[8], and to the p-Laplace version of the generalized Gelfand equation, where
we easily recover the corresponding result of J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt [7].

For each of the three classes of equations we show that along the solution
curves (as u(0) → ∞), the solutions tend to a singular solution (for which
u(r) → ∞, or u′(r) → ∞, as r → 0). Moreover, one can calculate the sin-
gular solutions explicitly, which is truly a remarkable feature of self-similar
equations. Singular solutions were studied previously by many authors, in-
cluding C. Budd and J. Norbury [2], F. Merle and L. A. Peletier [12], and
I. Flores [3].

2 Parameterization of the solution curves

We begin with the p-Laplace version of the generalized Gelfand equation

(2.1)

ϕ(u′)′ +

n − 1

r

ϕ(u′) + λ rαeu = 0 for 0 < r < 1, u′(0) = 0, u(1) = 0 ,

where ϕ(v) = v|v|p−2, p > 1. Observe that ϕ(sv) = sp−1ϕ(v) for any
constant s > 0. Assume that u(0) = a > 0. We set u = w + a, t = br. The
constants a and b are assumed to satisfy

λ = bα+pe−a .

Then (2.1) becomes

(2.2)

ϕ(w′)′ +

n − 1

t

ϕ(w′) + tαew = 0, w(0) = 0, w′(0) = 0 .

The solution of this problem w(t), which is a negative and decreasing func-
tion, is deﬁned for all t > 0, and it may be easily computed numerically.

(Write this equation as (cid:2)tn−1ϕ(w′)(cid:3)′ = −tn+α−1ew < 0, and conclude that

tn−1ϕ(w′) < 0, and then w′(t) < 0 for all t.) We have

0 = u(1) = a + w(b) ,

3

so that a = −w(b), and then λ = bα+pew(b). The solution curve for (2.1) is

(λ, u(0)) = (cid:16)bα+pew(b) , −w(b)(cid:17) ,

parameterized by b ∈ (0, ∞). The solution of (2.1) at b is u(r) = w(br) −
w(b). It will be convenient to write the solution curve as

(2.3)

(λ, u(0)) = (cid:16)tα+pew(t) , −w(t)(cid:17) ,

parameterized by t ∈ (0, ∞), and w(t) is the solution of (2.2). The solution
of (2.1) at the parameter value t is u(r) = w(tr) − w(t).

We consider next the problem

(2.4)

ϕ(u′)′ +

n − 1

r

ϕ(u′) + λ

rα

(1 − u)q = 0

for 0 < r < 1 ,

u′(0) = u(1) = 0 , 0 < u(r) < 1 ,

which arises in modeling of electrostatic micro-electromechanical systems
(MEMS), see [13], [5], [6]. Here λ is a positive parameter, q > 0 and α > 0
are constants, and as before ϕ(v) = v|v|p−2, p > 1. Any solution u(r) of
(2.4) is a positive and decreasing function (by the maximum principle), so
that u(0) gives its maximum value. Our goal is to compute the solution
curve (λ, u(0)). Let 1 − u = v. Then v(r) satisﬁes

(2.5)

ϕ(v′)′ +

n − 1

r

ϕ(v′) = λ

rα
vq

for 0 < r < 1, v′(0) = 0, v(1) = 1 .

Assume that v(0) = a. We scale v(r) = aw(r), and t = br. The constants a
and b are assumed to satisfy

(2.6)

λ = ap+q−1bα+p .

Then (2.5) becomes

(2.7)

ϕ(w′)′ +

n − 1

t

ϕ(w′) =

tα
wq , w(0) = 1, w′(0) = 0 .

The solution of this problem is a positive increasing function, which is de-
ﬁned for all t > 0. We have

1 = v(1) = aw(b) ,

4

and so a = 1
(cid:16) bα+p
wp+q−1(b) , 1 − 1
write the solution curve in the form

w(b) , and then λ = bα+p
w(b)(cid:17), parameterized by b ∈ (0, ∞). It will be convenient to

wp+q−1(b) . The solution curve (λ, u(0)) is

(2.8)

(λ, u(0)) =   tα+p

wp+q−1(t)

, 1 −

1

w(t)! ,

parameterized by t ∈ (0, ∞). In case p = 2, this parameterization was ﬁrst
derived by J.A. Pelesko [13], and was then used in [5]. The solution of (2.4)
at t is u(r) = 1 − w(tr)
w(t) .

Finally, we consider the problem (with the constants p > 1, q > 1, α ≥ 0)

(2.9)

ϕ(u′)′ +

n − 1

r

ϕ(u′) + λ rα(1 + u)q = 0 for 0 < r < 1 ,

u′(0) = u(1) = 0 ,

which was analyzed in case p = 2 and α = 0 by D.D. Joseph and T.S.
Lundgren [8]. If we set 1 + u = v, then v(r) satisﬁes

(2.10)

ϕ(v′)′ +

n − 1

r

ϕ(v′) + λrαvq = 0, v′(0) = 0, v(1) = 1 .

Assuming that v(0) = a, we scale v(r) = aw(r), and t = br. The constants
a and b are assumed to satisfy

(2.11)

Then (2.10) becomes

(2.12)

ϕ(w′)′ +

n − 1

t

λ =

bp+α
aq−p+1 .

ϕ(w′) + tαwq = 0, w(0) = 1, w′(0) = 0 .

The solution of (2.12) satisﬁes w′(t) < 0, so long as w(t) > 0 (the function
tn−1ϕ(w′(t)) is zero at t = 0, and its derivative is negative). It follows that
either there is a t0, so that w(t0) = 0 and w(t) > 0 on (0, t0), or w(t) > 0 on
(0, ∞) and limt→∞ w(t) = a ≥ 0. It is easy to see that a = 0 in the second
Indeed, assuming that a > 0, we have (cid:2)tn−1ϕ(w′)(cid:3)′ ≤ −aqtn+α−1,
case.
and integrating we conclude that w(t) ≤ 1 − ctγ, with some c > 0, and
γ = α+p
p−1 > 0, contradicting that w(t) > 0 on (0, ∞).

Lemma 2.1 Assume that

(2.13)

q >

np − n + p + pα

n − p

.

Then w(t) > 0, and w′(t) < 0 on (0, ∞), with limt→∞ w(t) = 0.

5

Proof:
that w(t0) = 0 and w(t) > 0 on (0, t0). Recall that for the equation

In view of the above remarks, we need to exclude the possibility

ϕ(w′)′ +

n − 1

t

ϕ(w′) + f (t, w) = 0 ,

the Pohozhaev function

P (t) = tn(cid:2)(p − 1)ϕ(w′)w′ + pF (t, w)(cid:3) + (n − p)tn−1ϕ(w′)w

is easily seen to satisfy

P ′(t) = tn−1 [npF (t, w) − (n − p)wf (t, w) + ptFt(t, w)] ,

where F (t, w) = R w

0 f (t, z) dz, see e.g., [10], p. 136. Here

P ′(t) = tn−1+α(cid:20) np

q + 1

− (n − p) +

pα

q + 1(cid:21) wq+1 < 0 .

Since P (0) = 0, and P (t0) > 0, we have a contradiction.

♦

As before, we have

1 = v(1) = aw(b) ,

and so a = 1

the solution curve (λ, u(0)) is (cid:16)bp+αwq−p+1(b) ,

w(b) , and then λ = bp+αwq−p+1(b). Under the condition (2.13),
w(b) − 1(cid:17), parameterized by

w(b) − 1. It will be convenient to

b ∈ (0, ∞). The solution at b is u(r) = w(br)
write the solution curve in the form

1

(2.14)

(λ, u(0)) = (cid:18)tp+αwq−p+1(t) ,

1

w(t)

− 1(cid:19) ,

parameterized by t ∈ (0, ∞). The solution of (2.9) at t is u(r) = w(tr)

w(t) − 1.

3 The equation modeling MEMS

We consider the problem (2.4), whose solution curve is given by (2.8), where
w(t) is the solution of (2.7). We have λ(t) = tα+p
wp+q−1(t) , where w(t) is the
solution of (2.7), and so

λ′(t) = tα+p−1w−p−q(cid:2)(α + p)w − t(p + q − 1)w′(cid:3) .

We are interested in the roots of the function (α + p)w − t(p + q − 1)w′. If
we set this function to zero

(α + p)w − t(p + q − 1)w′ = 0 ,

6

then the general solution of this equation is

w(t) = ctβ,

β =

α + p

p + q − 1

.

Quite remarkably, if we choose the constant c = c0 = h

under the condition that

1

β p−1[(p−1)(β−1)+n−1]i

1

p+q−1 ,

(3.1)

then

(p − 1)(β − 1) + n − 1 > 0 ,

w0(t) = c0tβ

also solves the equation in (2.7), along with w(t). We shall show that w(t),
the solution of the initial value problem (2.7), tends to w0(t) as t → ∞, and
the issue turns out to be whether w(t) and w0(t) cross inﬁnitely many times
as t → ∞.

Lemma 3.1 Assume that w(t) and w0(t) intersect inﬁnitely many times.
Then the solution curve of (2.4) makes inﬁnitely many turns.

Proof: Assuming that w(t) and w0(t) intersect inﬁnitely many times, let
{tn} denote the points of intersection. At {tn}’s, w(t) and w0(t) have diﬀer-
ent slopes (by uniqueness for initial value problems). Since (α + p)w0(tn) −
tn(p + q − 1)w′0(tn) = 0, it follows that (α + p)w(tn) − tn(p + q − 1)w′(tn) < 0
(> 0) if w(t) intersects w0(t) from below (above) at tn. Hence, on any inter-
val (tn, tn+1) there is a point t0, where (α + p)w(t0) − t0(p + q − 1)w′(t0) = 0,
i.e., λ′(t0) = 0, and t0 gives a critical point. Since λ′(tn) and λ′(tn+1) have
diﬀerent signs, the solution curve changes its direction over (tn, tn+1). ♦

We shall need the following well-known Sturm-Picone’s comparison the-

orem, see e.g., p. 5 in [11].

Lemma 3.2 Let u(t) and v(t) be respectively classical solutions of

(3.2)

(3.3)

(cid:0)a(t)u′(cid:1)′ + b(t)u = 0 ,
(cid:0)a1(t)v′(cid:1)′ + b1(t)v = 0 .

Assume that the given diﬀerentiable functions a(t), a1(t), and continuous
functions b(t) and b1(t), satisfy

(3.4)

b1(t) ≥ b(t), and 0 < a1(t) ≤ a(t)

for t ≥ t0 > 0.

In case a1(t) = a(t) and b1(t) = b(t) for all t, assume additionally that u(t)
and v(t) are not constant multiples of one another. Then, for t ≥ t0, v(t)
has a root between any two consecutive roots of u(t).

Lemma 3.3 Consider the equation

(3.5)

(cid:0)a0(t) (1 + f (t)) v′(cid:1)′ +

n − 1

t

a0(t) (1 + f (t)) v′ + b0(t) (1 + g(t)) v = 0 ,

with given diﬀerentiable functions a0(t) > 0 and f (t), and continuous func-
tions b0(t) > 0 and g(t). Assume that limt→∞ f (t) = limt→∞ g(t) = 0, and
there is an ǫ > 0 such that any solution of

(3.6)

(cid:0)a0(t) (1 + ǫ) v′(cid:1)′ +

n − 1

t

a0(t) (1 + ǫ) v′ + b0(t) (1 − ǫ) v = 0

has inﬁnitely many roots. Then any solution of (3.5) has inﬁnitely many
roots.

Proof: We rewrite (3.5) in the form (3.2), with a(t) = tn−1a0(t) (1 + f (t)),
and b(t) = tn−1b0(t) (1 + g(t)), and we rewrite (3.6) in the form (3.3), with
a1(t) = tn−1a0(t) (1 + ǫ), and b1(t) = tn−1b0(t) (1 − ǫ). For large t, the
inequalities in (3.4) hold, and the Lemma 3.2 applies.

and C = (p − 1)(n − p)2. We shall have A > 0, provided that

Theorem 3.1 Assume that q > 0, p > 1, with

(3.11)

(p − 1)(β − 1) + n − 1 > β ,

and the conditions (3.9) and (3.10) hold. Then the solution curve of (2.4)
makes inﬁnitely many turns. Moreover, along this curve (as u(0) → ∞),
λ → λ0 = 1

In view of Lemma 3.1, we need to show that w(t) and w0(t)
Proof:
intersect inﬁnitely many times. Let P (t) = w(t) − w0(t). Then P (t) satisﬁes

We claim that it is impossible for P (t) to keep the same sign over some

w0(t) → 1, since P (t) tends to a constant, and
w′(t)
0(t) → 1, by L’Hospital’s rule, as t → ∞.) Since Euler’s equation (3.7) has
w′
inﬁnitely many roots on (t0, ∞), we conclude by Lemma 3.3 that P (t) must
vanish on that interval too, a contradiction.

Next we show that if P (t0) = 0, then P (t) remains bounded for all
t > t0. Assume that P ′(t0) < 0, and the case when P ′(t0) > 0 is similar.
Then P (t) < 0 for t > t0, with t − t0 small. From (3.12), tn−1a(t)P ′(t) is
increasing for t > t0, so that

P ′(t) > −

a0

a(t)tn−1 ,

for t > t0

(with a0 = −tn−1

0

a(t0)P ′(t0) > 0) .

Since solutions of the linear equation (3.12) cannot go to inﬁnity over a
bounded interval, we may assume that t0 is large, and then by the above
a(t) ∼ a0(t) ∼ a1t(p−2)(β−1) for t > t0, and some a1 > 0. It follows that for
some a2 > 0

(3.15)

P ′(t) > −

tn−1+(p−2)(β−1) = −

a2
t1+ǫ ,

for t > t0 ,

with ǫ = n − 2 + (p − 2)(β − 1) > 0, in view of (3.11). Integrating over
(t0, t), and using that n ≥ 3, we conclude the boundness of P (t), so long as
P (t) < 0. If another root of P (t) is encountered, we repeat the argument.
Hence, P (t) remains bounded for all t > t0.

From the equation (3.12), we see that P (t) cannot have points of positive
minimum or points of negative maximum. We claim that if P (t) has one
root, it has inﬁnitely many roots. Indeed, assume that P (t1) = 0, and say
P ′(t1) > 0. For t > t1, P (t) remains bounded, but cannot tend to a constant.
Hence, P (t) will have to turn back and become decreasing, but it cannot
have a positive local minimum, or tend to a constant. Hence, P (t2) = 0 at
some t2 > t1, and so on.

We have P (0) = 1, so that (cid:0)tn−1a(t)P ′(t)(cid:1)′ < 0 for small t > 0. The

function q(t) ≡ tn−1a(t)P ′(t) satisﬁes q(0) = 0 and q′(t) < 0, and so q(t) < 0.
It follows that P ′(t) < 0 for small t > 0. Since P (t) cannot turn around,
or tend to a constant, we conclude the existence of the ﬁrst root t1 of P (t),
implying the existence of inﬁnitely many roots.

We show next that w(t) → w0(t) as t → ∞. Let tk and tk+1 be two
consecutive roots of P (t), and P ′(tk) < 0, so that P (t) < 0 on (tk, tk+1).
Let τk be the unique point of minimum of P (t) on (tk, tk+1). For negative
P (t) we have the inequality (3.15), with tk in place of t0. Integrating this
inequality over (tk, τk), we get

P (τk) > ¯c(cid:16)τ −ǫ

k − t−ǫ

k (cid:17) ( with some ¯c > 0) ,

which implies that |P (τk)| → 0, as k → ∞. The case when P ′(tk) > 0 is
similar, so that w(t) → w0(t) along the solution curve. Since u(r) = 1− w(tr)
w(t) ,
it follows that along the solution curve u(r) tends to 1 − w0(tr)
w0(t) = 1 − rβ,
while λ(t) tends to

Observe that in case β ∈ (0, 1), the limiting solution 1 − rβ is singular,
because u′(0) is not deﬁned. Notice also that the condition (3.11) implies
(3.1). Finally, observe that in case β ∈ (0, 1) the condition (3.11) implies
that n ≥ 2. Indeed, we can rewrite (3.11) as n > 2β + p(1 − β), which is a
point between p > 1, and 2.

One special case when this theorem applies is the following. Assume

that n ≥ p, so that (3.10) becomes

α + p

p + q − 1

> (n − p)

2pq(p + q − 1) + p2 − 3p + 2 − 2q

(p − 1) [4q − (p − 2)2]

.

Then (3.10) holds, provided that

(3.16)

2qq(p + q − 1) + p2 − 3p + 2 − 2q > 0 ,

4q > (p − 2)2 ,

p ≤ n < p +

(α + p)(p − 1)(cid:2)4q − (p − 2)2(cid:3)

(p + q − 1)(cid:16)2pq(p + q − 1) + p2 − 3p + 2 − 2q(cid:17)

.

Observe that the third inequality (n ≥ p) implies that the condition (3.1)
holds, and the second inequality is just (3.9). Hence, the three inequalties in
(3.16) imply the theorem. In case p = 2, the ﬁrst and the second inequalities
hold automatically, while the third one gives the condition in Z. Guo and J.

4 The generalized Joseph-Lundgren problem

We now study the problem (2.9). Its solution curve is represented by (2.14),
under the condition (2.13), where w(t) is the solution of (2.12). In particular,
λ(t) = tp+αwq−p+1(t), and we wish to know how many times this function
changes the direction of monotonicity for t ∈ (0, ∞).
(Here w(t) is the
solution of (2.12), the generating solution.) Compute

λ′(t) = tp+α−1wq−p(t)(cid:2)(p + α)w(t) + (q − p + 1)tw′(t)(cid:3) ,

so that we are interested in the roots of the function (p+α)w +(q −p+1)tw′.
If we set this function to zero

(p + α)w + (q − p + 1)tw′ = 0 ,

then the general solution of this equation is w(t) = at−β, with β = p+α
q−p+1 .
If we choose the constant a as

a = a0 = h(n − p)βp−1 − (p − 1)βpi

1

q−p+1

then w0(t) = a0t−β is a solution of (2.12), the guiding solution (we have
(n − p)βp−1 − (p − 1)βp > 0, under the condition (2.13), if n > p).

Lemma 4.1 Assume that w(t) and w0(t) intersect inﬁnitely many times.
Then the solution curve of (2.9) makes inﬁnitely many turns.

Indeed, assuming that w(t) and w0(t) intersect inﬁnitely many
Proof:
times, let {tn} denote their points of intersection. At {tn}’s, w(t) and w0(t)
have diﬀerent slopes (by uniqueness for initial value problems). Since (p +
α)w0(tn) + (q − p + 1)tnw′0(tn) = 0, it follows that (p + α)w(tn) + (q −
p + 1)tnw′(tn) > 0 (< 0) if w(t) intersects w0(t) from below (above) at tn.
Hence, on any interval (tn, tn+1) there is a point t0, where (p + α)w(t0) +
(q − p + 1)t0w′(t0) = 0, i.e., λ′(t0) = 0, and t0 is a critical point. Since λ′(tn)
and λ′(tn+1) have diﬀerent signs, the solution curve changes its direction
over (tn, tn+1).

Let us consider ﬁrst the case when p = 2 and α = 0, and n > 2. Then

q−1 , and the equation (4.2) becomes

1

t2z′′ + (n − 1)tz′ + qβ(n − β − 2)z = 0 .

Its characteristic equation

r(r − 1) + (n − 1)r + qβ(n − β − 2) = 0

has the roots

r =

−(n − 2) ±p(n − 2)2 − 4qβ(n − β − 2)

2

.

These roots are complex if

(n − 2)2 − 4qβ(n − 2) + 4qβ2 < 0 .

On the left we have a quadratic in n−2, with two positive roots. The largest
value of n − 2, for which this inequality holds, corresponds to the larger root
of this quadratic, i.e.,

(4.3)

n − 2 <

4q

.

We shall show that inﬁnitely many solutions occur if (4.3) holds, and

(4.4)

q >

.

(The last condition ensures that the generating solution w(t) is deﬁned for
all t > 0, by Lemma 2.1.) In terms of n, the conditions (4.3) and (4.4) imply

(4.5)

2 + 2q

< n < 2 +

4q

which is the condition from [8] (it implies that n > 2). Thus we shall recover
the following classical theorem of D.D. Joseph and T.S. Lundgren [8].

Theorem 4.1 Assume that the conditions (4.3) and (4.4) hold (or (4.5)
holds). Then the solution curve of (2.9) makes inﬁnitely many turns. More-
over, along this curve (as u(0) → ∞), λ → λ0 = aq−1
, and u(r) tends to
r−β − 1 for r 6= 0, which is a singular solution of the equation in (2.9).

We shall give a proof of more general result below.

For general p and α, the characteristic equation for (4.2) is

(4.6)

r(r − 1) + Ar + B = 0 ,

with A = −β(p − 2) + n − p + 1, and B = q(n−p)

p−1 β − qβ2. The roots of (4.6)

r =

−(A − 1) ±p(A − 1)2 − 4B

are complex, provided that

(A − 1)2 − 4B < 0 ,

which simpliﬁes to

(n − p)2 − θ(n − p) + γ < 0 ,

with
(4.8)

θ = 2β(p − 2) +

4qβ
p − 1

, γ = (p − 2)2β2 + 4qβ2 .

On the left in (4.7) we have a quadratic in n − p, with two positive roots.
The largest value of n − p, for which the inequality (4.7) holds, corresponds
to the larger root of this quadratic, i.e.,

(4.9)

n − p <

θ +pθ2 − 4γ

2

.

We shall show that inﬁnitely many solutions occur if the conditions (2.13)
and (4.9) hold. In terms of n, the conditions (2.13) and (4.9) imply that

(4.10)

pq + p + pα

q − p + 1

< n < p +

θ +pθ2 − 4γ

The ﬁrst inequality in (4.10) implies that

(4.11)

(β + 1)(p − 2) < n − 2 ,

which in turn gives that n > p.

Theorem 4.2 Assume that the conditions (2.13) and (4.9) hold (or (4.10)

, and u(r) tends to
r−β − 1 for r 6= 0, which is a singular solution of the equation in (2.9).

In view of Lemma 4.1, we need to show that w(t) and w0(t)
Proof:
intersect inﬁnitely many times, and they tend to each other as t → ∞. Let
P (t) = w(t) − w0(t). Then P (t) satisﬁes

Since both w(t) and w0(t) tend to zero as t → ∞ (see Lemma 2.1), we
conclude that P (t) → 0 as t → ∞. This simpliﬁes the proof considerably,
compared to Theorem 3.1. We claim that it is impossible for P (t) to keep
the same sign over some inﬁnite interval (t0, ∞). Assuming the contrary,
write (a0(t) and b0(t) were deﬁned in (4.1))

w0(t) → 1, since P (t) tends to a constant, and
w′(t)
0(t) → 1, by L’Hospital’s rule, as t → ∞.) Since Euler’s equation (3.7)
w′
has inﬁnitely many solutions on (tk, ∞), we conclude by Lemma 3.3 that
P (t) must vanish on that interval too, a contradiction. It follows that P (t)
has inﬁnitely many roots, which implies that w(t) and w0(t) have inﬁnitely
many points of intersection, and hence the solution curve makes inﬁnitely
many turns.

Since u(r) = w(tr)
w0(t) − 1 = r−β − 1 for r 6= 0.

w(t) − 1, it follows that along the solution curve u(r) tends

5 The generalized Gelfand problem

We now use the representation (2.3) for the solution curve of (2.1).
In
particular, λ(t) = tα+pew(t), where w(t) is the solution of (2.2), and the
issue is how many times this function changes its direction of monotonicity
for t ∈ (0, ∞). Compute

λ′(t) = tew(cid:0)α + p + tw′(cid:1) ,

so that we are interested in the roots of the function α + p + tw′. If we set
this function to zero

α + p + tw′ = 0 ,

then the solution of this equation is of course w(t) = a − (α + p) ln t. Quite

surprisingly, if we choose the constant a = a0 = ln(cid:2)(n − p)(α + p)p−1(cid:3),

assuming that n > p, then

w0(t) = lnh(n − p)(α + p)p−1i − (α + p) ln t

is a solution of the equation in (2.2)! We shall show that w(t) (the solution
of the initial value problem (2.2)) tends to w0(t) as t → ∞, and give a
condition for w(t) and w0(t) to cross inﬁnitely many times as t → ∞.

Lemma 5.1 Assume that w(t) and w0(t) intersect inﬁnitely many times.
Then the solution curve of (2.1) makes inﬁnitely many turns.

Indeed, assuming that w(t) and w0(t) intersect inﬁnitely many
Proof:
times, let {tn} denote the points of intersection. At {tn}’s, w(t) and w0(t)
have diﬀerent slopes (by uniqueness for initial value problems). Since α +
p + tnw′0(tn) = 0, it follows that α + p + tnw′(tn) > 0 (< 0) if w(t) intersects
w0(t) from below (above) at tn. Hence, on any interval (tn, tn+1) there is a
point t0, where α + p + t0w′(t0) = 0, i.e., λ′(t0) = 0, and t0 is a critical point.
Since λ′(tn) and λ′(tn+1) have diﬀerent signs, the solution curve changes its
direction over (tn, tn+1).

The linearized equation for (2.2) is

(cid:0)ϕ′(w′)z′(cid:1)′ +

n − 1

ϕ′(w′)z′ + tαewz = 0 .

a0(t)z′ + b0(t)z = 0 ,

(p − 1)t2z′′ + (p − 1)(n − p + 1)tz′ + (n − p)(p + α)z = 0 ,

which is Euler’s equation! Its characteristic equation

(p − 1) r(r − 1) + (p − 1)(n − p + 1) r + (n − p)(p + α) = 0

has the roots

r =

−(p − 1)(n − p) ±p((p − 1)(n − p) [p − 1)(n − p) − 4(p + α)]

2(p − 1)

.

The roots are complex if n − p > 0, and the quantity in the square brackets
is negative (the opposite inequalities lead to a vacuous condition), i.e., when

(5.2)

p < n <

p2 + 3p + 4α

p − 1

.

We now easily recover the following result of J. Jacobsen and K. Schmitt
[7], which was a generalization of the famous theorem of D.D. Joseph and
T.S. Lundgren [8].

Theorem 5.1 Assume that the condition (5.2) holds. Then the solution
curve of (2.1) makes inﬁnitely many turns. Moreover, along this curve (as
u(0) → ∞), λ → ea0 = (n − p)(p + α)p−1, and u(r) tends to −(p + α) ln r
for r 6= 0, which is a singular solution of the equation in (2.1).

Proof: We follow the proof of the Theorem 3.1. In view of Lemma 5.1,
we need to show that w(t) and w0(t) intersect inﬁnitely many times. Let
P (t) = w(t) − w0(t). Then P (t) satisﬁes

(5.3)

where

esw(t)+(1−s)w0(t) ds .

Compared with the proof of the Theorem 3.1, we have a complication here:
in case P (t) tends to a constant p0 as t → ∞, we cannot conclude that
b(t) = b0(t)(1 + o(1)), unless p0 = 0.

17

We claim that it is impossible for P (t) to keep the same sign over some
inﬁnite interval (t0, ∞), and tend to a constant p0 6= 0 as t → ∞. Assume,
on the contrary, that P (t) > 0 on (t0, ∞), and limt→∞ P (t) = p0 > 0. We
may assume that

(5.6)

P (t) >

1
2

p0 > 0 on (t1, ∞), with some t1 > t0 .

Write (5.3) as

(5.7)

As before,

(cid:16)tn−1a(t)P ′(cid:17)′ = −tn−1b(t)P .

(5.8)

a(t) = a0(t) (1 + f (t)) , with f (t) → 0 as t → ∞ .

0 esP (t) ds, we see that

b(t) = b0(t) (p1 + g(t)) ,

(5.9)

Writing b(t) = tαew0(t)R 1
with p1 = R 1

0 esp0 ds > 1, and g(t) → 0 as t → ∞. By (5.7), (5.6), and (5.9)

(cid:16)tn−1a(t)P ′(cid:17)′ < −c1tn−p−1 on (t1, ∞) ,

for some constant c1 > 0. Integrating this inequality over (t1, t), we get

(5.10)

tn−1a(t)P ′ < c2 − c3tn−p on (t1, ∞) ,

for some constants c2 > 0, and c3 > 0 (using that n > p). By (5.8)

a(t) > c4t−p+2 on (t2, ∞) ,

for some constants c4 > 0, and t2 > t1. Using this in (5.10), we have

P ′ <

c2
c4

t−n+p−1 −

c3
c4

t−1 on (t2, ∞) .

Integrating this over (t2, t), and using that n > p

P (t) < c5 +

c2

c4(−n + p)

t−n+p −

c3
c4

ln t < c5 −

c3
c4

ln t ,

for some constant c5 > 0. Hence, P (t) has to vanish at some t > t2,
contradicting the assumption that P (t) > 0 on (t0, ∞). This proves that
p0 = 0. We conclude that p1 = 1 in (5.9), and the rest of the proof is similar
to that of Theorem 3.1.
♦

If p = 2 and α = 0, the condition (5.2) becomes 2 < n < 10, the classical

condition of D.D. Joseph and T.S. Lundgren [8].
