Abstract

In this work, g-radical supplemented modules which is a proper gen-
eralization of g-supplemented modules are deﬁned and some properties of
these modules are investigated. It is proved that the ﬁnite sum of g-radical
supplemented modules is g-radical supplemented. It is also proved that
every factor module and every homomorphic image of a g-radical supple-
mented module is g-radical supplemented. Let R be a ring. Then RR is
g-radical supplemented if and only if every ﬁnitely generated R-module
is g-radical supplemented. In the end of this work, it is given two exam-
ples for g-radical supplemented modules seperating with g-supplemented
modules.

Key words: Small Submodules, Radical, Supplemented Modules, Radical

(Generalized) Supplemented Modules.

1 INTRODUCTION

In this paper, all rings are associative with identity and all modules are unital
left modules.

Let M be an R -module and N ≤ M . If L = M for every submodule L of
M such that M = N + L, then N is called a small submodule of M , denoted by
N << M . Let M be an R -module and N ≤ M . If there exists a submodule
K of M such that M = N + K and N ∩ K = 0, then N is called a direct
summand of M and it is denoted by M = N ⊕ K. For any module M, we
have M = M ⊕ 0. The intersection of all maximal submodules of an R-module
M is called the radical of M and denoted by RadM . If M have no maximal
submodules, then we call RadM = M . A submodule N of an R -module M is
called an essential submodule and denoted by N E M in case K ∩ N 6= 0 for

1

every submodule K 6= 0. Let M be an R -module and K be a submodule of M .
K is called a generalized small submodule of M denoted by K <<g M if for
every essential submodule T of M with the property M = K + T implies that
T = M . It is clear that every small submodule is a generalized small submodule
but the converse is not true generally. Let M be an R−module. M is called an
hollow module if every proper submodule of M is small in M . M is called local
module if M has a largest submodule, i.e. a proper submodule which contains
all other proper submodules. Let U and V be submodules of M . If M = U + V
and V is minimal with respect to this property, or equivalently, M = U + V
and U ∩ V << V , then V is called a supplement of U in M . M is called a
supplemented module if every submodule of M has a supplement in M . Let
M be an R-module and U, V ≤ M .
If M = U + V and M = U + T with
T E V implies that T = V , or equivalently, M = U + V and U ∩ V ≪g M ,
then V is called a g-supplement of U in M . M is called g-supplemented if
every submodule of M has a g-supplement in M . The intersection of maximal
essential submodules of an R-module M is called a generalized radical of M
and denoted by RadgM . If M have no maximal essential submodules, then we
denote RadgM = M.

Lemma 1.1 Let M be an R -module and K, L, N, T ≤ M . Then the followings
are hold. [3,5]

(1) If K ≤ N and N is generalized small submodule of M , then K is a

generalized small submodule of M .

(2) If K is contained in N and a generalized small submodule of N , then K
is a generalized small submodule in submodules of M which contains submodule
N .

(3) Let f : M → N be an R -module homomorphism. If K ≪g M , then

f (K) ≪g M .

(4) If K ≪g L and N ≪g T , then K + N ≪g L + T .

Corollary 1.2 Let M1, M2, ..., Mn ≤ M , K1 ≪g M1, K2 ≪g M2, ..., Kn ≪g
Mn. Then K1 + K2 + ... + Kn ≪g M1 + M2 + ... + Mn.

Corollary 1.3 Let M be an R -module and K ≤ N ≤ M . If N ≪g M , then
N/K ≪g M/K.

Corollary 1.4 Let M be an R -module, K ≪g M and L ≤ M . Then (K + L) /L ≪g
M/L.

Lemma 1.5 Let M be an R-module. Then RadgM = PL≪gM L.

Proof. See[3].

Lemma 1.6 The following assertions are hold.

(1) If M is an R−module, then Rm ≪g M for every m ∈ RadgM .
(2) If N ≤ M , then RadgN ≤ RadgM.
(3) If K, L ≤ M , then RadgK + RadgL ≤ Radg (K + L) .

(4) If f : M −→ N is an R-module homomorphism, then f (RadgM ) ≤

RadgN.

(5) If K, L ≤ M , then Radg

Lemma 1.7 Let M = ⊕i∈I Mi. Then RadgM = ⊕i∈I RadgMi.

Proof. Since Mi ≤ M , then by Lemma 1.6(2), RadgMi ≤ RadgM and
⊕i∈I RadgMi ≤ RadgM. Let x ∈ RadgM. Then by Lemma 1.6(1), Rx ≪g M.
Since x ∈ M = ⊕i∈IMi, there exist i1, i2, ..., ik ∈ I and xi1 ∈ Mi1 , xi2 ∈ Mi2 ,
..., xik ∈ Mik such that x = xi1 + xi2 + ... + xik . Since Rx ≪g M , then
by Lemma 1.1(4), under the canonical epimorphism πit (t = 1, 2, ..., k) Rxit =
πit (Rx) ≪g Rxit . Then xit ∈ RadgMit (t = 1, 2, ..., k) and x = xi1 + xi2 + ... +
xik ∈ ⊕i∈I RadgMi. Hence RadgM ≤ ⊕i∈I RadgMi and since ⊕i∈I RadgMi ≤
RadgM , RadgM = ⊕i∈I RadgMi.

2 G-RADICAL SUPPLEMENTED MODULES

Deﬁnition 2.1 Let M be an R-module and U, V ≤ M . If M = U + V and U ∩
V ≤ RadgV , then V is called a generalized radical supplement (brieﬂy, g-radical supplement)
of U in M . If every submodule of M has a generalized radical supplement in M ,
then M is called a generalized radical supplemented (brieﬂy, g-radical supplemented)
module.

Clearly we see that every g-supplemented module is g-radical supplemented.
But the converse is not true in general (See Example 2.20 and Example 2.21).

Lemma 2.2 Let M be an R-module and U, V ≤ M . Then V is a g-radical
supplement of U in M if and only if M = U + V and Rm ≪g V for every
m ∈ U ∩ V .

Proof. (⇒) Since V is a g-radical supplement of U in M , M = U + V and
U ∩ V ≤ RadgV . Let m ∈ U ∩ V . Since U ∩ V ≤ RadgV , m ∈ RadgV . Hence
by Lemma 1.6(1), Rm ≪g V .

(⇐) Since Rm ≪g V for every m ∈ U ∩ V , then by Lemma 1.6(1), U ∩ V ≤

RadgV and hence V is a g-radical supplement of U in M .

Lemma 2.3 Let M be an R-module, M1, U, X ≤ M and Y ≤ M1. If X is
a g-radical supplement of M1 + U in M and Y is a g-radical supplement of
(U + X) ∩ M1 in M1, then X + Y is a g-radical supplement of U in M .

Proof. Since X is a g-radical supplement of M1 +U in M , M = M1 +U +X and
(M1 + U ) ∩ X ≤ RadgX. Since Y is a g-radical supplement of (U + X) ∩ M1 in
M1, M1 = (U + X) ∩ M1 + Y and (U + X) ∩ Y = (U + X) ∩ M1 ∩ Y ≤ RadgY .
Then M = M1 + U + X = M1 = (U + X) ∩ M1 + Y + U + X = U + X + Y
and, by Lemma 1.6(3), U ∩ (X + Y ) ≤ (U + X) ∩ Y + (U + Y ) ∩ X ≤ RadgY +
(M1 + U ) ∩ X ≤ RadgY + RadgX ≤ Radg (X + Y ). Hence X + Y is a g-radical
supplement of U in M .

3

Lemma 2.4 Let M = M1 + M2. If M1 and M2 are g-radical supplemented,
then M is also g-radical supplemented.

Proof. Let U ≤ M . Then 0 is a g-radical supplement of M1 + M2 + U in M .
Since M1 is g-radical supplemented, there exists a g-radical supplement X of
(M2 + U ) ∩ M1 = (M2 + U + 0) ∩ M1 in M1. Then by Lemma 2.3, X + 0 = X
is a g-radical supplement of M2 + U in M . Since M2 is g-radical supplemented,
there exists a g-radical supplement Y of (U + X) ∩ M2 in M2. Then by Lemma
2.3, X + Y is a g-radical supplement of U in M .

Corollary 2.5 Let M = M1 + M2 + ... + Mk. If Mi is g-radical supplemented
for every i = 1, 2, ..., k, then M is also g-radical supplemented.

Proof. Clear from Lemma 2.4.

Lemma 2.6 Let M be an R−module, U, V ≤ M and K ≤ U . If V is a g-
radical supplement of U in M , then (V + K) /K is a g-radical supplement of
U/K in M/K.

Proof. Since V is a g-radical supplement of U in M , M = U + V and U ∩ V ≤
RadgV . Then M/K = U/K + (V + K) /K and by Lemma 1.6(5), (U/K) ∩
((V + K) /K) = (U ∩ V + K) /K ≤ (RadgV + K) /K ≤ Radg (V + K) /K.
Hence (V + K) /K is a g-radical supplement of U/K in M/K.

Lemma 2.7 Every factor module of a g-radical supplemented module is g-radical
supplemented.

Proof. Clear from Lemma 2.6.

Corollary 2.8 The homomorphic image of a g-radical supplemented module is
g-radical supplemented.

Proof. Clear from Lemma 2.7.

Lemma 2.9 Let M be a g-radical supplemented module. Then every ﬁnitely
M −generated module is g-radical supplemented.

Proof. Clear from Corollary 2.5 and Corollary 2.8.

Corollary 2.10 Let R be a ring. Then RR is g-radical supplemented if and
only if every ﬁnitely generated R−module is g-radical supplemented.

Proof. Clear from Lemma 2.9.

Theorem 2.11 Let M be an R−module. If M is g-radical supplemented, then
M/RadgM is semisimple.

4

Proof. Let U/RadgM ≤ M/RadgM . Since M is g-radical supplemented,
there exists a g-radical supplement V of U in M . Then M = U + V and
U ∩ V ≤ RadgV . Thus M/RadgM = U/RadgM + (V + RadgM ) /RadgM
and (U/RadgM ) ∩ ((V + RadgM ) /RadgM ) = (U ∩ V + RadgM ) /RadgM ≤
(RadgV + RadgM ) /RadgM = RadgM/RadgM = 0. Hence M/RadgM =
U/RadgM ⊕ (V + RadgM ) /RadgM and U/RadgM is a direct summand of
M .

Lemma 2.12 Let M be a g-radical supplemented module and L ≤ M with
L ∩ RadgM = 0. Then L is semisimple. In particular, a g-radical supplemented
module M with RadgM = 0 is semisimple.

Proof. Let X ≤ L. Since M is g-radical supplemented, there exists a g-radical
supplement T of X in M . Hence M = X + T and X ∩ T ≤ RadgT ≤ RadgM .
Since M = X + T and X ≤ L, by Modular Law, L = L ∩ M = L ∩ (X + T ) =
X + L ∩T . Since X ∩T ≤ RadgM and L ∩RadgM = 0, X ∩L ∩T = L ∩X ∩T ≤
L ∩ RadgM = 0. Hence L = X ⊕ L ∩ T and X is a direct summand of L.

Proposition 2.13 Let M be a g-radical supplemented module. Then M = K ⊕
L for some semisimple module K and some module L with essential generalized
radical.

Proof. Let K be a complement of RadgM in M. Then by [8, 17.6], K ⊕
RadgM E M . Since K ∩ RadgM = 0, then by Lemma 2.12, K is semisim-
ple. Since M is g-radical supplemented, there exists a g-radical supplement L
of K in M . Hence M = K + L and K ∩ L ≤ RadgL ≤ RadgM . Then by
K ∩ RadgM = 0, K ∩ L = 0. Hence M = K ⊕ L. Since M = K ⊕ L, then by
Lemma 1.7, RadgM = RadgK ⊕ RadgL. Hence K ⊕ RadgM = K ⊕ RadgL.
Since K ⊕ RadgL = K ⊕ RadgM E M = K ⊕ L, then by [1, Proposition 5.20],
RadgL E L.

Proposition 2.14 Let M be an R−module and U ≤ M . the following state-
ments are equivalent.

(1) There is a decomposition M = X ⊕ Y with X ≤ U and U ∩ Y ≤ RadgY .
(2) There exists an idempotent e ∈ End (M ) with e (M ) ≤ U and (1 − e) (U ) ≤

Radg (1 − e) (M ).

(3) There exists a direct summand X of M with X ≤ U and U/X ≤

Radg (M/X).

(4) U has a g-radical supplement Y such that U ∩ Y is a direct summand of

U .

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2) For a decomposition M = X ⊕ Y , there exists an idempotent
e ∈ End (M ) with X = e (M ) and Y = (1 − e) (M ). Since e (M ) = X ≤ U ,
we easily see that (1 − e) (U ) = U ∩ (1 − e) (M ). Then by Y = (1 − e) (M )
and U ∩ Y ≤ RadgY , (1 − e) (U ) = U ∩ (1 − e) (M ) = U ∩ Y ≤ RadgY =
Radg (1 − e) (M ).

(2) ⇒ (3) Let X = e (M ) and Y = (1 − e) (M ). Since e ∈ End (M ) is
idempotent, we easily see that M = X ⊕ Y . Then M = U + Y . Since e (M ) =

5

X ≤ U , we easily see that (1 − e) (U ) = U ∩ (1 − e) (M ). Since M = U + Y
and U ∩ Y = U ∩ (1 − e) (M ) = (1 − e) (U ) ≤ Radg (1 − e) (M ) = RadgY , Y is
a g-radical supplement of U in M . Then by Lemma 2.6, M/X = (Y + X) /X
is a g-radical supplement of U/X in M/X. Hence U/X = (U/X) ∩ (M/X) ≤
Radg (M/X).

(3) ⇒ (4) Let M = X ⊕ Y . Since X ≤ U , M = U + Y . Let t ∈ U ∩ Y and
Rt+T = Y for an essential submodule T of Y . Let ((T + X) /X)∩(L/X) = 0 for
a submodule L/X of M/X. Then (L ∩ T + X) /X = ((T + X) /X)∩(L/X) = 0
and L∩T +X = X. Hence L∩T ≤ X and since X ∩Y = 0, L∩T ∩Y ≤ X ∩Y = 0.
Since L ∩ Y ∩ T = L ∩ T ∩ Y = 0 and T E Y , L ∩ Y = 0. Since X ≤ L and
M = X + Y , by Modular Law, L = L ∩ M = L ∩ (X + Y ) = X + L ∩ Y =
X + 0 = X. Hence L/X = 0 and (T + X) /X E M/X. Since Rt + T = Y ,
R(t + X) + (T + X) /X = (Rt + X) /X + (T + X) /X = (Rt + T + X) /X =
(Y + X) /X = M/X. Since t ∈ U , t + X ∈ U/X ≤ Radg (M/X) and hence
R (t + X) ≪g M/X. Then by R(t+X)+(T + X) /X and (T + X) /X E M/X,
(T + X) /X = M/X and then X + T = M . Since X + T = M and T ≤ Y , by
Modular Law, Y = Y ∩ M = Y ∩ (X + T ) = X ∩ Y + T = 0 + T = T . Hence
Rt ≪g Y and by Lemma 2.2, Y is a g-radical supplement of U in M . Since
M = X ⊕ Y and X ≤ U , by Modular Law, U = U ∩ M = U ∩ (X ⊕ Y ) =
X ⊕ U ∩ Y . Hence U ∩ Y is a direct summand of U .

(4) ⇒ (1) Let U = X ⊕ U ∩ Y for a submodule X of U . Since Y is a g-radical
supplement of U in M , M = U + Y and U ∩ Y ≪g Y . Hence M = U + Y =
(X ⊕ U ∩ Y ) + Y = X ⊕ Y .

Theorem 2.15 Let V be a g-radical supplement of U in M. If U is a generalized
maximal submodule of M , then U ∩V is a unique generalized maximal submodule
of V .

Proof. Since U is a generalized maximal submodule of M and V / (U ∩ V ) ≃
(V + U ) /U = M/U , U ∩ V is a generalized maximal submodule of V . Hence
RadgV ≤ U ∩ V and since U ∩ V ≤ RadgV , RadgV = U ∩ V . Thus U ∩ V is a
unique generalized maximal submodule of V .

Deﬁnition 2.16 Let M be an R−module. If every proper essential submodule
of M is generalized small in M or M has no proper essential submodules, then
M is called a generalized hollow module.

Clearly we see that every hollow module is generalized hollow.

Deﬁnition 2.17 Let M be an R−module. If M has a large proper essential
submodule which contain all essential submodules of M or M has no proper
essential submodules, then M is called a generalized local module.

Clearly we see that every local module is generalized local.

Proposition 2.18 Generalized hollow and generalized local modules are g-supplemented,
so are g-radical supplemented.

Proof. Clear from deﬁnitions.

Proposition 2.19 Let M be an R−module and RadgM 6= M . Then M is
generalized hollow if and only if M is generalized local.

(=⇒) Let M be generalized hollow and let L be a proper essential
Proof.
submodule of M . Then L ≪g M and by Lemma 1.5, L ≤ RadgM . Thus
RadgM is a proper essential submodule of M which contain all proper essential
submodules of M .

(⇐=) Let M be a generalized local module, T be a large essential submodule
of M and L be a proper essential submodule of M . Let L + S = M with S E M .
If S 6= M , then L + S ≤ T 6= M. Thus S = M and L ≪g M.

Example 2.20 Consider the Z−module Q. Since RadgQ = RadQ = Q, ZQ is
g-radical supplemented. But, since ZQ is not supplemented and every nonzero
submodule of ZQ is essential in ZQ, ZQ is not g-supplemented.

Example 2.21 Consider the Z−module Q ⊕ Zp2 for a prime p.
It is easy
to check that RadgZp2 6= Zp2 . By Lemma 1.7, Radg (cid:0)Q ⊕ Zp2(cid:1) = RadgQ ⊕
RadgZp2 6= Q ⊕ Zp2 . Since Q and Zp2 are g-radical supplemented, by Lemma
2.4, Q ⊕ Zp2 is g-radical supplemented. But Q ⊕ Zp2 is not g-supplemented.
