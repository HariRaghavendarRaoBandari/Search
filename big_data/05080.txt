ABSTRACT

In this paper, we investigate the communication cost of reproducing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering correlations
arising from bipartite quantum systems. We characterize the set of bipartite quantum states which admits a local hidden state
model augmented with c bits of classical communication from an untrusted party (Alice) to a trusted party (Bob). In case of
one bit of information (c = 1), we show that this set has a nontrivial intersection with the sets admitting a local hidden state and
a local hidden variables model for projective measurements. On the other hand, we ﬁnd that an inﬁnite amount of classical
communication is required from an untrusted Alice to a trusted Bob to simulate the EPR steering correlations produced by a
two-qubit maximally entangled state. It is conjectured that a state-of-the-art quantum experiment would be able to falsify two
bits of communication this way.

Introduction
Quantum entanglement is a remarkable phenomenon that has no counterpart in classical physics.1, 2 Beyond its fundamen-
tal importance, it is a crucial resource in quantum information and quantum computing.3 Entanglement gives rise to the
phenomenon of Bell nonlocality,4, 5 which lies at the heart of device-independent quantum information processing.6 Such
device-independent protocols are greatly immune against errors which are due to deviations of the ideal description of the
setup from the actual physical implementation.

There is an intermediate form of non-separability between entanglement and nonlocality linked to the phenomenon of
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering,7 which was put on a ﬁrm basis recently by Wiseman, Doherty and Jones8, 9 by intro-
ducing an information task for arbitrary quantum systems. Since then, both the detection10–13 and quantiﬁcation14–20 of EPR
steering have been thoroughly investigated with interesting applications in quantum information21–23 and recent experimental
tests.24–28 More recent experiments have addressed multipartite quantum steering29 and one-way steering.30, 31

Quantum correlations can be phrased in terms of an information task wherein a referee, say Charlie, wants to verify that
two parties, called Alice and Bob, share an entangled state (see Fig. 1 displaying the setup). In the preparation stage of the
protocol, Alice and Bob share a number of copies of a bipartite state r , and for each of those states Charlie asks them to
perform one of a number of measurements chosen by Charlie at random. Alice’s and Bob’s measurements are denoted by
Ma|x and Mb|y, respectively, where x and y denote the choice of measurements and a and b their corresponding outputs. By
repeating the procedure many times, they form the joint probability distribution PQ(ab|xy), which is given by

(1)

PQ(ab|xy) = tr(r Ma|x ⊗ Mb|y).

That is, the object of our study is the probability distribution of the outputs of the two parties dependent on each party’s input
(i.e. choice of measurement settings). Throughout we will assume that measurements are projective ones, that is, M2
a|x = Ma|x
b|y = Mb|y. Note that for two-outcome settings (which is our main concern) this is not a limitation.32
and M2
Basically, there are three options to certify entanglement depending on the number of trusted parties participating in the
protocol. Charlie trusts both Alice and Bob (and their apparatuses). Charlie trusts (say) Bob, but not Alice. Finally, Charlie
trusts neither Alice nor Bob.

In the latter case of no trust at all (i.e. the Bell nonlocality scenario), we say that a quantum state r

is Bell local or equiv-
alently admits a local hidden variables (LHV) model (for projective measurements), when the statistics PQ(ab|xy) originating
from arbitrary local (projective) measurements Ma|x and Mb|y in (1) can be reproduced by a distribution of the form

P(l )Pl (a|x)Pl (b|y),

P(ab|xy) = (cid:229)
is some shared classical random variable distributed according to the density P(l ), and Pl (a|x) and Pl (b|y) are
In that case, the distribution PQ(ab|xy) cannot violate

any Bell inequality. Conversely, if the distribution PQ(ab|xy) cannot be written in the form (2), it violates a Bell inequality.
This implies that some form of extra communication is required between Alice and Bob in order to reproduce the statistics
PQ(ab|xy).
On the other hand, in case of partial trust (i.e. an EPR steering scenario), we obtain the data PQ(ab|xy) with an additional
knowledge that Bob’s system is well-characterized. That is, Charlie trusts Bob’s measurements {Mb|y}b,y. In that case, the
state r shared by Alice and Bob is said to be unsteerable or equivalently to admit a local hidden state (LHS) model, when the
statistics PQ(ab|xy) can be reproduced by a distribution of the form (2), where now

Pl (b|y) = tr(s l Mb|y).

(3)

In that case, the distribution PQ(ab|xy) cannot violate the so-called steering inequalities. Conversely, if the distribution
PQ(ab|xy) cannot be written in the form (2) with the above restriction (3) on Pl (b|y), it violates a steering inequality. Again,
this means that some communication has to be taken place between Alice and Bob to reproduce the obtained statistics
PQ(ab|xy).
Finally, in the case that Charlie trusts both Alice’s and Bob’s measurement devices, the LHS model above becomes a
quantum separable (QS) model, where there exist local density operators s Al and s Bl such that the response functions of Alice
and Bob in the formula (2) are given respectively by Pl (a|x) = tr(s Al Ma|x) and Pl (b|y) = tr(s Bl Mb|y). Failure of satisfying this

model implies entanglement. This again can be detected through the violation of certain inequalities which are conventionally
called entanglement witnesses.

However, observing either a violation of a LHV model in the Bell nonlocality scenario, or violation of a LHS model in the
EPR steering scenario, or violation of a QS model in the entanglement scenario will not quantify the amount of communication
beyond the fact that some communication was indeed required. In case of Bell nonlocality, where no trust is assumed in either
devices, Bacon and Toner provided a general framework for a measure of nonlocality by allowing the parties to communicate
some bits of information after selecting the measurement settings.33 They in particular proved that correlations produced by
projective measurements on the two-qubit singlet state can be simulated with a LHV model augmented by a single bit of
communication.34

In this paper, we pose an analogous question in the EPR steering scenario. Our aim is to quantify the correlations arising
from quantum (projective) measurements conducted by Alice on her share of an entangled particle. To do so, we allow some
amount of classical communication from the untrusted party Alice to a trusted party Bob.

The structure of the paper is as follows. We ﬁrst present the Bell nonlocality setup by Bacon and Toner.33 Then we
translate this setup to the EPR-steering scenario. In particular, we develop a computational framework to decide if an EPR
correlation produced by quantum theory can be simulated by a LHS model plus exchanging a number of bits of communication.
We provide an efﬁcient code based on semideﬁnite programming (SDP)35 to solve such a membership problem. This allows
us to explore the shape of the set of two-qubit states admitting a LHS model augmented with one bit of communication, a
set we denote by LHS(1). Speciﬁcally, we prove that the set LHS(1) is strictly larger than the set of states admitting a LHS
model (for projective measurements). On the other hand, we conduct an extensive numerical search which indicates that there
exist two-qubit quantum states admitting a LHV model (assuming projective measurements), which nevertheless cannot be
described by a LHS model assisted with 1 bit of classical communication. Finally, we show that an inﬁnite amount of classical
communication is required from an untrusted Alice to a trusted Bob to simulate the statistics of any bipartite pure entangled
state in this scenario.

Results

Bell nonlocality with communication
Bacon and Toner use the following classical protocol to simulate a Bell scenario33 (see also Ref.36 for more recent results).
Let us consider c = log2 d bits of classical communication sent from Alice’s device to Bob’s device. Upon receiving input x,
Alice’s device sends communication c and outputs a with probability P(a,c|x). Upon receiving input y and communication c,
Bob’s device outputs b with probability P(b|y). We thus have that

P(ab|xy) =

d(cid:229)

c=1

P(a,c|x)P(b|y,c).

(4)

In the simulation protocol, we also would like to take into account the possibility that Alice and Bob’s devices are correlated
due to a common random variable l , which was prepared and distributed between the parties before receiving inputs x and y

Figure 1. The setup for simulating (a) Bell nonlocal and (b) EPR steering correlations with local models using auxiliary
communication. In (a) the simulation protocol is as follows. The two parties distribute shared randomness l . Charlie sends
settings (x,y) to the two parties. After obtaining the settings, Alice is allowed to communicate to Bob a classical message
consisting of c bits. Finally, Alice and Bob give outputs a and b as a function of available information for each party. The (b)
protocol is similar to (a) with the difference that Charlie fully trusts Bob, hence, we can assume that Bob performs a given set

of quantum measurements {Mb|y}b,y on s l .

nication c to match PQ(ab|xy) with the distribution P(ab|xy) in Eq. (5). They prove that c = 1 bit of communication assistance
(i.e. sending a message with d = 2 levels) is enough for Alice and Bob to reproduce any correlations PQ(ab|xy) by measuring
arbitrary projective measurements on a maximally entangled two-qubit state.34 Fig 1.(a) displays this setup.

EPR steering with communication
We ask the analogous question what happens if (unlike in case of the Bell nonlocality scenario) Charlie completely trusts Bob’s
measurement device. This is the framework of EPR steering. In this case, we obtain the data PQ(ab|xy) with an additional
knowledge that Bob’s equipment is well-characterized. Hence our model is the same as (5), but with the constraint that

Pl (b|y,c) = tr(s l ,cMb|y),

(6)

where Bob’s measurements {Mb|y}b,y are trusted by Charlie and the states s l ,c are of unit trace and positive. Note, however,

that in this case Bob’s measurements will not depend on the communication c, since they can be considered as supplied by
Charlie. Please see Fig. 1.(b), which shows this setup. Hence we get

P(ab|xy) = (cid:229)

where Dl (a,c|x) are some deterministic strategies labeled by l
shared randomness of Pl (a,c|x) can always be considered as part of shared randomness (represented by l ) and hence can

the communicated message is one bit (c = 1,2), each deterministic strategy Dl can be considered as an m-component vector
~v = (v1, . . . ,vm) with four possible entries (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2) standing for the values (a,c). Hence, in this case
there are 4m different deterministic strategies for Alice.

In fact, given the statistics PQ(ab|xy) and a set of measurement operators {Mb|y}b,y in Eq. (7), this is a feasibility problem to
check if a LHS model augmented with c bits of communication can reproduce the distribution PQ(ab|xy). If so, the underlying
state of the distribution PQ(ab|xy) in (1) can be reproduced with a LHS model with some extra communication c. Then, by
deﬁnition, r
We can write this feasibility problem as an SDP code. To this end, we deﬁne the sub-normalized states ˜s l ,c = P(l )s l ,c
l tr ˜s l ,c = 1 for all c = 1, . . . ,d. Then, we have

where the data PQ(ab|xy) is arising from formula (1) and Mb|y are ﬁxed measurements of Bob. We can in fact simplify a bit the
above code by eliminating Bob’s measurements Mb|y. To this end, let us deﬁne the conditional (unnormalized) states prepared
by Alice on Bob’s subsystem by

s a|x = trA(r Ma|x ⊗ 11).

(9)

This set of states is called assemblage18, 19 and captures the whole physics of an EPR steering scenario. With this assemblage,
we have PQ(ab|xy) = tr(s a|xMb|y). Let us assume that Bob’s measurements Mb|y form a complete basis of Bob’s Hilbert space.
In case of a two-dimensional Hilbert space, this can be the three Pauli matrices, Mb|y = (11 + (−1)b ˆs y)/2, where ˆs y, y = 1,2,3
denote the Pauli operators and the two possible outcomes are denoted by b = 0,1. Then, the SDP code simpliﬁes to

It is worth noting that the above code simpliﬁes to the one derived in Ref.18 in case of c = 0 bit of communication (that is,

Exploring the shape of the LHS(1) set of states
In this subsection, we explore the shape of the LHS(c) set, where we set c = 1 bit. Speciﬁcally, we ask how it ﬁts into the set
of bipartite states which admit a LHS or LHV model. Let us note that the new set LHS(1) is also convex by construction. We
ﬁnd a nontrivial structure of this new set. To this end, we investigate special one-parameter slices of the full two-qubit state
space. In particular, we choose two special one-parameter families, the Werner states of two-qubits and another family, which
coincides with the two-qubit reduced state of the n-qubit Wn state37 for parameters p = 2/n. The obtained results suggest that
the LHS(1) set of states has a nontrivial shape as depicted in the schematic picture of Fig. 2.

We use the SDP code (10) to test one-parameter families of two-qubit quantum states. Namely, let us write the state as a

mixture of a pure entangled state and a noisy part parameterized by the weight v:

r (v) = v|y ihy | + (1− v)r noise,

quantum separable (QS) states, the largest set contains all states. States which have a LHV model (i.e. Bell local) are in
between these sets. States which have a LHS model (i.e. unsteerable) are sandwiched between the LHV and QS sets. The
new set (whose boundary is drawn by a dashed line) is termed as LHS(1) and it has a nontrivial intersection with the LHS
and LHV sets. In this paper, we prove the existence of point A and conjecture supported by extensive numerical calculations
the existence of point B.

where r noise is some ﬁxed separable state and |y i is any two-qubit entangled pure state. A small variation of the semi-deﬁnite
program (10) (please see Methods section for the actual code) gives us an efﬁcient method to place an upper bound on vcrit,
where vcrit denotes the boundary of states admitting a LHS(1) model. Such numerical computations, as well as all subsequent
ones presented in this paper, were carried out using the Matlab packages YALMIP38 and the SDP solver SeDuMi.39

Then, using a heuristic search (e.g., we used an Amoeba routine40), we lower the value of this upper bound on vcrit by
varying the set of measurements {Ma|x}a,x. This way, we get better and better upper bounds to the true value of vcrit by
minimizing the parameters entering Alice’s set of measurements {Ma|x}a,x. We remark that due to the heuristic nature of the
search, the program may not provide us a global minimum for vcrit, however, for reasonable number of settings (say, mA ≤ 6)
and a fair number of independent iterations, the obtained bound to our experience is quite reliable.

and LHV models. It shows the shaded interval [0.7056,1/√2 ≃ 0.7071], where the state has a LHS(1) model, nevertheless it

is nonlocal. We note that the values 1/3 and 1/2 corresponding to the respective QS and LHS models are tight. That is, any v
larger than these values results in failure of these models. However, according to the ﬁgure, this is not the case for the LHS(1)
and LHV models and there arises a gap between the best upper and lower bounds on the critical value of v.

We ﬁrst consider the Werner state of two qubits,41 which is given by
r W (v) = v|y
−i = (|01i− |10i)/√2 is the singlet state and v is the visibility. The Werner state is separable up to v = 1/3 and
where |y
exhibits a LHS model up to v = 1/2.8, 9, 28 These models are tight, hence v > 1/3 implies entanglement, whereas v > 1/2
implies violation of EPR steering inequalities.

Concerning the LHS(1) model, we ﬁnd the following results. First, in the Methods section a LHS(1) model is provided

up to visibility v = 1/√2 ≃ 0.7071 of the Werner states. On the other hand, Amoeba optimization provides us with a steering

inequality for m = 4 settings which is violated above the parameter v = 0.7842. Also, by setting Alice’s 12 measurements to

point toward the vertices of an icosahedron on the Bloch sphere, we get a more powerful steering inequality which is violated
above v = 0.7423 (note that due to reﬂection symmetry of the icosahedron, it is enough to consider m = 6 vertices in the actual
code). Therefore, there is no LHS(1) model below v = 0.7423, as depicted in Fig. 3. We state it as an open problem what
the exact value of the critical v above which no LHS(1) model exists if m goes to inﬁnity. On the other hand, there is a 465
setting Bell inequality,42, 43 which is violated by a Werner state above v = 0.7056, which implies that there exists no LHV
model for the Werner state for v > 0.7056. Again, this bound is shown in Fig. 3. The above bounds entail that the LHS(1) set
has portions outside the LHV (i.e. Bell local) set of states. This is the shaded region depicted in Fig. 3 and proves in turn the
existence of point A in the schematic Fig. 2 (i.e., a state which is nonlocal and admits a LHS(1) model). Since the set of states
admitting a LHV model is a strict superset of the states admitting a LHS model,44, 45 it follows that the LHS(1) set is strictly
different from the LHS set. We provide an alternative proof of this fact in the Methods section.

Note that the hierarchy QS ⊆ LHS ⊆ LHV of the sets is implied by the deﬁnitions. Moreover, it is known due to the
works of Refs.41, 44 that the above relations are strict, that is, we have QS ( LHS ( LHV . It is interesting to ask if the
same hierarchy applies in the presence of a ﬁxed amount of communication (say 1 bit). Indeed, implied by the deﬁnition of
these sets, we have QS(c) ⊆ LHS(c) ⊆ LHV (c) for any c bits. We now show that the inclusion relations are strict, that is,
QS(c) ( LHS(c) ( LHV (c) for any ﬁnite number of c bits. The ﬁrst strict inclusion relation comes from the fact that there is
no QS(¥
) model (and consequently no QS(c) model for any c as well) for the Werner state for v > 1/2. A sketch of this proof
is deferred to the Methods section. Recalling that the Werner state admits a LHS(1) model (and consequently a LHS(c) model
for c ≥ 1) up to v = 1/√2, it follows the strict relation QS(c) ( LHS(c). The second strict relation LHS(c) ( LHV (c) in case
of c = 1 comes from the fact that the Werner state for parameter v = 1 admits a LHV(1) model due to the model of Toner and
Bacon34 and on the other hand there is no LHS(1) model above v = 0.7423 due to our result. Furthermore, in the following
section we prove that no LHS(c) model with ﬁnite c exists for the two-qubit maximally entangled state (i.e., for the Werner
state with v=1). Then we have LHS(c) ( LHV (1) for any ﬁnite c and the second strict relation LHS(c) ( LHV (c) follows for
any ﬁnite c ≥ 1.

The other family of states to be investigated looks as follows:

r R(p) = p|y +ihy +| + (1− p)|0ih0|⊗|0ih0|,

where |y +i = (|01i +|10i)/√2. Notice that this state is the two-qubit reduced state of the n-qubit Wn state37 for p = 2/n. We
note that for this particular p = 2/n, the state is (n− 1)-symmetric extendable,46 hence there is a LHV model (and therefore
also a LHS model) for n− 1 settings (with arbitrary number of outcomes). The LHS bound seems to be tight, as we could
recover the bound of v = 2/n up to numerical precision for n ≤ 6 settings using the SDP method developed in Ref.18 (please
see second column of Table 1). This correspondence suggests that there is no LHS model for any ﬁnite p > 0 if the number
of settings is large enough. Using our numerical search described in the Methods section, we ﬁnd the threshold values p
regarding the LHS(1) model in the third column of Table 1.

On the other hand, we conjecture that the local bound pLHV is 1/√2 ≃ 0.7071. Our conjecture is based on a linear
programming approach combined with a heuristic search over the measurement angles47 of Alice and Bob to get an upper
bound on pLHV for a given number of measurement settings. For two settings per party (m = 2), we have the (analytical)
upper bound of 1/√2 on pLHV. However, by moving up to m = 8 settings per party, using numerical computations, this upper
bound value did not become lower. Note that due to the heuristic nature of the search we cannot guarantee that 1/√2 is the
optimal value. Though, at this level of complexity we are fairly conﬁdent about the validity of this threshold value. Moreover,
we conjecture that this bound cannot be beaten beyond m = 8 settings as well. Similar conclusion was drawn by Amirtham.48
The above results (modulo our conjecture) indicate a point B in Fig. 2, displaying portions of the LHV set lying outside the
LHS(1) set.

Steering-like inequalities with any ﬁnite number of communication
In this subsection, we go beyond the case of one bit of communication (i.e., c = 1). To this end, we construct a steering
inequality with c = log2(d) number of bits of communication, which can be violated by a 2-qubit maximally entangled state
for any ﬁnite d if the number of settings m for Alice is large enough. Violation implies that there is no LHS(c) model for any
ﬁnite number of c bits for a 2-qubit maximally entangled state. Combing this result with a recent work of Ref.20 entails that
the same applies to any pure bipartite entangled state. More details about equivalence of states with respect to LHS(c) models
are found in the Methods section.

Let us also remark that there is an interesting nested feature of the sets LHS(c), namely they satisfy LHS(c− 1) ⊆ LHS(c)
for any c ≥ 1 implied by the deﬁnition (where we identiﬁed LHS(0) ≡ LHS). Moreover, in case of c = 1, we have just shown
that the inclusion relation is strict, that is LHS ( LHS(1). It can be shown that in case of c → ¥
all states are recovered,
that is, the set LHS(c → ¥ ) approaches the set of all quantum states. We conjecture and state it as an open problem whether
LHS(c− 1) ( LHS(c) holds true in case of any ﬁnite c ≥ 1.

A steering inequality with communication assistance is a linear functional of the joint probabilities P(ab|xy),
S ≡ (cid:229)

a a,b,x,yP(ab|xy) ≤ Lc,

(14)

a,b,x,y

where the bound Lc holds for any statistics P(ab|xy) of the form (5) arising from a LHS(c) model. Note that in the absence
of communication (c = 0), we return to the standard steering inequalities. Hence, if a PQ distribution of the form (1) violates
bound Lc in (14), it implies that the underlying state of the probability distribution PQ lies outside the LHS(c) set.

Let us consider a steering-like inequality augmented with c bits of communication involving m binary outcome settings

particular, let us arrange Bob’s observables to lie on the x-z plane of the Bloch sphere, ~uy = (cos(p y/m),0,sin(p y/m)) for
settings y = 1, . . . ,m.

According to model (7), in case of communicating c = log2 d bits (i.e., a d level classical message is sent from Alice to

Bob), the Lc value corresponding to the LHS(c) limit is deﬁned by maximizing the following expression

Let us now choose the particular case of sending c = log2(m− 1) bits (i.e. Alice communicates a d = m− 1 level message

to Bob). Then, Lc is given by maximizing
m− 2 +hAx~ux ·~s + Ax′~ux′ ·~s ir

which reduces to maximizing

Sm =

As we can see, the value Lc is strictly smaller than 1 for any m. On the other hand, quantum mechanics allows us to obtain
the algebraic bound of 1 in the left-hand side of the inequality (15). The quantum strategy comprises a maximally entangled

−i and Alice’s measurements~vx = −~ux, for x = 1, . . . ,m whereby we get the perfect correlation Exx = 1 for all x.

state |y
Therefore, we have an example, where we are unable to simulate quantum strategies by augmenting the LHS model with
any ﬁnite number of bits of communication c = log2(m− 1) from Alice to Bob. Note, however, that as m goes to inﬁnity the
Lc value becomes close to 1, resulting in a very poor noise resistance. We pose it as an intriguing problem to construct more
powerful steering-like inequalities exhibiting better noise tolerance.

As an experimentally relevant case, let us choose m = 5, in which case the number of communicated bits is c = log2(m−
1) = 2. In that case, the LHS(c=2) bound in formula (20) becomes L2 = 0.9804. Due to our result, a Werner state with
visibility larger than L2 along with well-chosen measurements violates this two-bit bound L2. In light of recent experimental
progress demonstrating EPR steering,24–26 we believe this bound should be overcome in state-of-the-art photonic experiments.

Discussion
In this paper, we extended the notion of Bell inequalities with auxiliary communication to the EPR steering scenario. To do
so, we introduced a general framework based on an efﬁcient SDP method. With this tool, we characterized the set of bipartite
states which admits a local hidden state model augmented with 1 bit of classical communication (the so-called LHS(1) model)
from untrusted Alice to trusted Bob. This LHS(1) set of states was proven to be strictly larger than the set of states admitting
an LHS model (for projective measurements). Moreover, this LHS(1) set turns out to have portions outside the LHV set. On
the other hand, we conducted an extensive numerical search which indicates that there exist local two-qubit quantum states,
which nevertheless cannot be described by an LHS(1) model (assuming projective measurements). We also showed that an
inﬁnite amount of classical communication is required from Alice to trusted Bob to simulate the EPR-steering statistics arising
from any bipartite pure entangled state.

There is a number of open questions which deserves further investigations.

• We found a gap for the visibility v in case of the Werner states between the best LHS(1) model (deﬁning a lower
bound) and violation of a steering-like inequality with one bit of communication (deﬁning an upper bound). Would it
be possible to close this gap either by improving the lower bound or by improving the upper bound value?

• Based on extensive numerical search we conjectured that the LHV set has portions outside the LHS(1) set of states. Is

there a formal proof of this conjecture?

• We quantiﬁed quantum steering with the amount of classical communication between the two parties. What happens if

we consider other resources such as certain no-signalling resources?
• Another question concerns one-way steerability of quantum states.49 As an extension of one-way steerable states, we
ask whether there exists a bipartite quantum state, such that Alice can steer Bob’s state, however, it is impossible for
Bob to steer Alice’s state even allowing 1 bit of classical communication between them.

• It would be also interesting to see how our results relate to LHV models allowing classical communication. We know
that 2 bits of communication sufﬁce to simulate projective measurements on any two-qubit entangled state.34 However,
in the EPR steering scenario due to our results any ﬁnite number of bits is not enough. Does the same result hold true if
we add some noise to the singlet state?

• In case of c = 1 we have shown that the nested relation LHS(c− 1) ( LHS(c) holds true. It would be interesting to see

if this strict hierarchical relation generalizes to any ﬁnite number of c bits.

• Finally, it is also interesting to consider the extension of the steering task with communication to the multipartite realm

(see, e.g., Refs.23, 29, 50).

Methods
Semideﬁnite program to compute critical weights
Here we provide an SDP program to compute an upper bound on vcrit in the formula (11). Assuming the form of the state (11),
the assemblage s a|x deﬁned by Eq. (9) in function of parameter v is given by

s a|x(v) = vFa|x + (1− v)Ga|x,

where

Fa|x = trA(|y ihy |Ma|x ⊗ 11)

LHS(1) model for a Werner state
Here we present a simulation protocol which gives an LHS model augmented with 1 bit of classical communication for the
2-qubit Werner state up to the visibility 1/√2. We proceed in two steps. Our ﬁrst protocol will work for visibility up to 2/3,
whereas the second one, building on the ﬁrst protocol, works up to the higher visibility of 1/√2.

Our ﬁrst one bit protocol is as follows. Alice and Bob share two independently and uniformly distributed random variables

~l 1 and~l 2 over the unit sphere. The protocol proceeds as follows:

1. Alice receives input vector ~a.
2. Alice outputs a = +1 if |~a·~l 0| > |~a·~l 1|, otherwise outputs a = −1.
3. Alice sends a bit c to Bob which labels~l c, c = 1,2 for which a = +1.
4. Upon receiving this information, Bob outputs the state s ~l c
The goal of this protocol is to reproduce the assemblage (9) originating from a two-qubit Werner state (12). The assemblage

= 11+~l c·~s

.

of a Werner state is given by

s a |~a = trA(r W (v)Ma |~a ⊗ 11) =

11 + a v~a·~s

4

,

(24)

where Ma |~a = (11 + a ~a· s )/2 are rank-1 projectors, where a = ±1. Because of redundancy, it is enough to reproduce the

following object

s ~a = s

+1|~a − s

−1|~a =

v~a·~s

in case of a Werner state with visibility v.

On the other hand, the object s ~a coming from the simulation protocol can be expressed as

s

sgn(~a·~l 2)~s ~l 2

,otherwise.

Using symmetries, we can further write

s ~a =

2(cid:18) 1

4p 2Z d~l 1d~l 2 max{|~a·~l 1|,|~a·~l 2|}(cid:19)~a·~s .

Comparing this formula with (25), the critical visibility v is given by the closed form expression

v =

4p 2Z d~l 1d~l 2 max{|l 1z|,|l 2z|} =

where we used the fact that because of spherical symmetry we can take ~a pointing to the north pole (i.e. to positive z-axis),
hence ~a·~l c = l cz for c = 1,2 and we also used the fact that

Z du1du2 max{(|u1|,|u2|)} =

We now improve the above one bit protocol up to visibility v = 1/√2. To this end, we use the same protocol as before, but
this time~l 1 and~l 2 are correlated variables. We choose them as~l 1 = U~ez,~l 2 = U~ex, such that the 2× 2 matrix U is distributed
according to the Haar measure on SU(2). In that case, the protocol gives s ~a = s

where n (U) deﬁnes the Haar measure on SU(2) and~l 1 = U~ez,~l 2 = U~ex. Let us set ~a ≡ ~ez by rotating the coordinate system

The LHS(1) set is strictly larger than the LHS set
Here we prove the title. For the two-qubit Werner states the LHS set of states is bounded by v = 1/2.8, 9, 28 Hence any LHS(1)
model giving a threshold value higher than v = 1/2 does the job. Hence, the LHS(1) model with threshold v = 1/√2 presented
in Methods section previously provides us with the desired proof. We give here a LHS(1) model with a smaller threshold
v = 0.5899. Though, this value is worse than our previous threshold v = 1/√2, the present proof is completely different and
maybe of independent interest. In fact, the proof below for an LHS(1) model is a special instance of the algorithmic procedure
to construct LHS models appeared in Refs.52, 53

Let us pick the icosahedron, a platonic solid which has 12 vertices and 20 faces. Using the SDP deﬁned in Methods A, we
compute vcrit = 0.7423 for the measurements pointing toward the 12 vertices of the icosahedron. Note that the icosahedron
has a reﬂection symmetry through the center, and it is enough to take only 6 of its vertices:

~u1 = (0,1,j )
~u2 = (0,1,−j )
~u3 = (1,j ,0)
~u4 = (1,−j ,0)
~u5 = (j ,0,1)
~u6 = (−j ,0,1)

(31)
is the golden ratio j = (1 +√5)/2. Following Refs.,50–53 any vector ~u which is within the (largest) inscribed sphere
where j
of this icosahedron, can be expressed as the convex combination of the 12 vertices (the ones in (31) and its inverted versions).
The computation takes roughly 1 min on a normal desktop PC. If we normalize the vertices (31) such that all of them have unit

length from the origin, the radius of the inscribed sphere is r =q(5 + 2√5)/15 ∼ 0.794654. Hence, the Werner state with
visibility vcrit = 0.742344 has a LHS(1) model for any set of noisy observables of Alice A = m A(~u) for m ≤ r = 0.794654.
As a side remark, we note that the above value of vcrit = 0.742344 can be obtained by using the steering-like inequality Sm =
(cid:229) m
x=1 Ex,x/m presented in the Results section. Indeed, by setting Bob’s Bloch vectors in (15) according to (31) will recover this
value up to numerical precision. An optimal LHS(1) strategy is as follows: r(x) = (1,0,0,0,0,1) and Ax = [1,−1,−1,1,1,1].
With this strategy, we have to maximize S6 = (1/6)(h−~u2·~s −~u3 ·~s +~u4·~s +~u5·~s ir 0 +h~u1 ·~s + u6·~s ir 1) over r 0,r 1. The
maximum is given by S6 = (1/6)(|−~u2−~u3 +~u4 +~u5| +|~u1 +~u6|) =q 5
We now use the identity trA (m A⊗ 11r W (v)) = trA (A⊗ 11r W (m v)), which in words tells us that the statistics of noisy
observables m A on the Werner state r W (v) perfectly match the statistics of noiseless observables A on the Werner state having
visibility m v. We thus have a Werner state with visibility v ≤ rvcrit ≃ 0.589907, which gives us a LHS(1) model for v ≤ 0.5899

18√5 ≃ 0.742344.

) model for Werner states for v > 1/2

No QS(¥
Here we provide a sketch of the proof for the title. We ﬁrst give an inequality which proves the (known) result that the Werner
state is entangled above v = 1/3. The same inequality will be used to prove that the Werner state does not admit a QS(¥
)
model for v > 1/2. The inequality is as follows.

which is similar to inequality (15). Here we assume that both Alice’s and Bob’s measurements are continuously and evenly
distributed on the Bloch sphere, and our task is to compute Lc in case of c = 0 and c = ¥ bits of communication from Alice to
Bob.
l P(l )tr(s Al Ax)tr(s Bl By) in the QS model, where Ax = ~ux ·~s
and By = ~uy ·~s . Exploiting spherical symmetry and the convex property of the deﬁnition Ex,y, we can take s Al = s Bl = |0ih0|

Let us start with c = 0. Then we use the deﬁnition Ex,y = (cid:229)

without loss of generality and the maximization provides

L0 =

(33)

where ~u is distributed uniformly on the unit sphere and uz denotes ~ez ·~u. Note that the maximum of the right-hand-side of
inequality (32) is 1, attainable with a maximally entangled two-qubit state (i.e. Werner state with v = 1). Then we obtain the
result that Werner states with v > 1/3 violate the quantum separability inequality (32), hence they are entangled in this range.
. Since the amount of communication is unbounded, Alice is able to communicate her measure-
ment settings x to Bob, which permits Bob to adjust his hidden state s Bl according to x. This in turn implies the maximum

Next we deal with c = ¥

L¥ = maxZ d~u|tr (|0ih0|·|~uih~u|)| =

4p 2Z d~u|uz| =

(34)

Then we obtain the announced result that Werner states with v > 1/2 violate the quantum separability inequality (32), therefore
there is no QS(¥

) model for the parameter range v > 1/2.

Equivalence of states concerning the LHS(c) model
An LHS(c) model for the 2-qubit Werner state gives rise to the same LHS(c) model for more general quantum states. To this
end, we note the recent result on the equivalence of states using local ﬁltering (or more generally of any trace non-increasing
CP maps) on Bob’s side.20 Following the same steps as in the proof of Lemma 2 in Ref.,20 it can be shown that if Bob
performs ﬁltering operation on any state which has a LHS(c) model, the resulting state also admits a LHS(c) model. Now
let Bob apply a local ﬁlter FB(q ) = cosq |0ih0| + sinq |1ih1| on the Werner state (12). The state after this operation becomes
r q (v) = v|y (q )ihy (q )| + (1 − v)11/2 ⊗ s , and s = trA|y (q )ihy (q )|, where |y (q )i = sinq |01i + cosq |10i. This result
implies that r q (v) has a LHS(1) model for any q > 0 below v = 1/√2. However, this threshold may not be tight, that is, it
does not rule out the possibility of a higher vcrit (q ) for q ≤ p /4.
