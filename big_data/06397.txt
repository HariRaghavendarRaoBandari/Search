Introduction

We are concerned with solutions of semilinear parabolic equations of the following type:

∂tu − ∆u + V uq = f

in QT := Ω × (0, T ] ,

(1.1)

where Ω ⊆ M is a connected domain on a complete Riemannian manifold, the potential V =
V (x, t) and the source term f = f (x, t) are given continuous functions in QT . Moreover, we
suppose that f ≥ 0, f 6≡ 0, while V can be signed. We consider both the case q > 0 and u ≥ 0,
and that q < 0 and u > 0.

The elliptic counterpart of equation (1.1), that is

− ∆u + V uq = f

in Ω,

(1.2)

with V and f continuous functions deﬁned in Ω, has been largely investigated in the literature.
In particular, in [10] pointwise estimates for the solutions of (1.2) have been obtained. Indeed,
in [10] also more general divergence form elliptic operators with smooth coeﬃcients have been
addressed. Assume that the Dirichlet Green function of −∆ in Ω exists, and denote it by GΩ(x, y).
Set

H(x) := ZΩ
assume that H(x) < ∞ for all x ∈ Ω, and that

GΩ(x, y)f (y)dµ(y) ;

˜H(x) := ZΩ

GΩ(x, y)hq(y)V (y)dµ(y)

is well-deﬁned. In [10] it is shown that if q > 0, then u satisﬁes a pointwise estimate from below,
in terms of the functions H and ˜H. On the other hand, if q < 0, then u satisﬁes a similar
pointwise estimate from above. Moreover, using similar inequalities, suﬃcient conditions for
the existence of positive solutions of equation (1.2) have been obtained, provided Ω is relatively
compact. Observe that in particular cases the results established in [10] have been already shown
in the literature (see, e.g., [3], [4], [5], [8], [9], [11]) . However, in the remarkable paper [10] it is
given a uniﬁed approach for treating all the values of q ∈ R \ {0}, a general signed potential V ,
and a general divergence form operator, also on domains of Riemannian manifolds.

Recently, also parabolic equations with a potential on Riemannian manifolds have been in-
vestigated (see, e.g., [2], [12], [13], [14]); however, it seems that in general pointwise estimates for
solutions of equation (1.1) have not been addressed. In this paper we aim at obtaining point-
wise estimates for solutions of (1.1), in the same spirit of the results in [10], concerning elliptic
equations.

Let p the heat kernek in Ω (see Section 2); for any f ∈ C(QT ), deﬁne for all (x, t) ∈ QT

Furthermore, for any u0 ∈ C(Ω) ∩ L∞(Ω), u0 ≥ 0, deﬁne for all (x, t) ∈ QT

a similar estimate from above is obtained. Indeed, note that in the case q < 0, as well as in the
elliptic case, a suitable extra pointwise condition at inﬁnity for the solution is required. However,
in the parabolic case, if M is stochastically complete, such a condition can be replaced by a
growth condition at inﬁnity, which is a weaker assumption.

that are based on estimates analogous to those described above. We should note that our results
seem to be new also in the case that M = Rn.

In order to prove our results, we adapt to parabolic equations the methods used in [10]. At
ﬁrst we prove our pointwise estimates assuming that Ω is a relatively compact connected domains,
and replacing h deﬁned in (1.7) by a function ζ ∈ C 2,1(QT ) ∩ C( ¯QT ) that satisﬁes

To do that the main step is to consider the equation solved by uv, where

∂tζ − ∆ζ ≥ 0 in QT ,
ζ > 0 in Ω × [0, T ] .

(1.11)

v := φ−1(cid:16) u
h(cid:17) ,

φ being an appropriate smooth function. Then a suitable approximation procedure is used to
obtain the desired estimates in possible not relatively compact domain Ω, with h deﬁned in (1.7).
In our arguments a special role is played by an appropriate comparison result, that is applied to
the function uv. Note that the proof of such a comparison result is quite diﬀerent from that in
[10] for the elliptic case. Furthermore, on a special class of Riemannian manifolds, including the
stochastically completes ones, we can show a reﬁned comparison result. In view of this, we can
show the estimates from above in the case q < 0, only assuming growth conditions at inﬁnity on
the solutions of (1.1).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recall some basic notions in Riemannian
Geometry and in Analysis on manifolds that will be used in the sequel. Then we state our main
results in Section 3. In Section 4 we show some preliminary results, including the comparison
results mentioned above, that will be essential in the proofs of the main theorems, that can be
found in Sections 5 and 6.

2 Mathematical framework

Let M be an n−dimensional Riemannian manifold with a Riemannian metric tensor g = (gij ).
In any chart with coordinates x1, x2 . . . , xn, the associated Laplace-Beltrami operator is given by

∆u =

1

√detg

n

Xi,j=1

∂xi(cid:0)pdetggij ∂xj u(cid:1) ,

where detg is the determinant of the matrix g = (gij), (gij ) is the inverse matrix of (gij), and
u ∈ C 2(M ). The Riemannuan measure dµ in the same chart reads by

dµ = pdetgdx1 . . . dxn ;

3

furthermore, the gradient of a function u ∈ C 1(M ) is

(∇u)i =

n

Xj=1

gij ∂xj u

(i = 1, . . . , n).

For any f, g ∈ C 2(M ) we have

Moreover, for any w ∈ C 2(M ) and φ ∈ C 2(IR) there holds

∆(f g) = f ∆g + 2h∇f,∇gi + g∆f .

∆[φ(w)] = φ′(w)∆w + φ′′(w)|∇w|2 .

(2.1)

(2.2)

We denote by ∂∞M the inﬁnity point of the one-point compactiﬁcation of M (see for example

[19, Sec. 5.4.3]). For any function u : Ω ⊆ M → R we write

lim

x→∂∞M

u(x) = 0

to indicate that u(x) → 0 as d(x, o) → ∞, o ∈ M being a ﬁxed point; here and hereafter d(x, y)
denotes the geodesic distance from x to y. Similarly we mean equalities and inequalities involving
lim inf and lim sup.

By standard results (see, e.g., [6]) the heat kernel in Ω, p(x, y, t), is well-deﬁned. For each

ﬁxed y ∈ Ω, p(x, y, t) is the smallest positive solution of equation

such that

∂tp − ∆p = 0 in QT ,

lim
t→0+

p(x, y, t) = δy ,

where δy is the Dirac delta concentrated at y. Moreover, p ∈ C ∞(Ω × Ω × (0,∞)),

(2.3)

p(x, y, t) = ZΩ

p(x, y, t) > 0 for any x, y ∈ Ω, t > 0,

p(x, y, t) = p(y, x, t)

for any x, y ∈ Ω, t > 0 ,

p(x, z, s)p(z, y, t − s)dµ(y)
ZΩ

p(x, y, t)dµ(y) ≤ 1 for any x ∈ Ω, t > 0 .

for any t > 0, 0 < s < t, x, y ∈ Ω ,

Furthermore, (see [7, Theorem 7.16]) for any u0 ∈ C(Ω) ∩ L∞(Ω), the function

v(x, t) := ZM

p(x, y, t)u0(y)dµ(y) , x ∈ Ω, t > 0

belongs to C ∞(Ω × Ω × (0,∞)), satisﬁes equation (2.3), and

v(x, t) → u0(x)

as t → 0+ locally uniformly w.r.t. x ∈ Ω .

In addition, if ∂Ω is smooth, then v ∈ C( ¯QT ), and

v = 0 in ∂Ω × (0, T ] .

4

As usual, we say that f is locally Holder continuous in QT , if there exists α ∈ (0, 1) such that

for any compact subset K ⊂ Ω, 0 < τ ≤ T

|f (x, t) − f (y, s)| ≤ L(cid:2)d(x, y)α + |t − s|

for some L = LK,τ > 0. We set

α

for all x, y ∈ K, t, s ∈ (τ, T ) ,

∂2u

∂xi∂xj

, ∂tu ∈ C(QT ) for any i, j = 1, . . . , n(cid:27) .

We have that (see, e.g.

[1]) if (1.4) holds and f is locally Holder continuous in QT and

u0 ∈ C(Ω) ∩ L∞(Ω), then the function h deﬁned in (1.7) satisﬁes h ∈ C 2,1(QT ) and

∂tu − ∆u = f

in QT .

(2.4)

Moreover, if f ∈ L∞(QT ) and u0 ∈ C(Ω) ∩ L∞(Ω) , then h ∈ C(Ω × [0, T ]) and

h = u0
Finally, if ∂Ω is smooth and f ∈ C( ¯QT ), then

in Ω × {0} .

h = 0 in ∂Ω × (0, T ] .

(3.20)

In the next theorem, we give suﬃcient conditions for the existence of nonnegative solutions of
problem (1.9), in the case that Ω is relatively compact, and u0 ∈ C( ¯Ω), with u0 = 0 on ∂Ω. Note
that, the last compatibility condition allows us to construct solutions that attain continuously
zero on the whole parabolic boundary. Moreover, we establish two-sided pointwise estimates for
such solutions.

Theorem 3.3 Let Ω ⊂ M be a connected relatively compact subset with boundary ∂Ω of class C 1.
Suppose that f and V are locally Holder continuous in QT , and that f ∈ C( ¯QT ), f ≥ 0, f 6≡ 0.
Assume that u0 ∈ C( ¯Ω) , u0 = 0 on ∂Ω. Let (1.4) be satisﬁed, and let h be deﬁned by (1.7). Then

3.1 Further results for q < 0

Consider domains Ω that are not relatively compact. If q < 0, under suitable hypotheses, we can
remove condition (3.1) and then getting Theorem 3.1-(iv) and in Theorem 3.2-(iv).

We assume that there exist µ > 0 and a subsolution Z of equation

∆Z = µZ in Ω ,

(3.25)

7

such that

Z(x) = −∞ .
By a subsolution of (3.25) we mean a function Z ∈ C 2(Ω) such that

Z < ∞ ,

sup
Ω

lim

x→∂∞M

∆Z ≥ µZ in Ω .

(3.26)

(3.27)

Observe that our results remain true if Z is continuous in Ω and satisﬁes (3.27) in the distribu-
tional sense. Note that, in the case Ω = M , the existence of such a subsolution Z implies that
M is stochastically complete (see [6]), i.e.

ZM

p(x, y, t) dµ(y) = 1

for all x ∈ M,

t > 0 .

We refer the reader to [6] for suﬃcient and necessary condition for the existence of such subsolution
Z. We limit ourselves to observe that such a subsolution Z exists for instance on Rn, n ≥ 3, and
on the hyperbolic space Hn, n ≥ 2.
Theorem 3.4 Let q < 0. Let Ω ⊆ M be an open not relatively compact connected subset. Suppose
that V, f ∈ C(QT ), f ≥ 0, f 6≡ 0 in QT , u0 ∈ C(Ω)∩ L∞(Ω), u0 ≥ 0. Assume that u ∈ C 2,1(QT )∩
C( ¯QT ) satisﬁes (1.8). Let conditions (1.4) and (3.2) be satisﬁed, and let h be deﬁned by (1.7).
Let there exist µ > 0 and a subsolution Z of equation (3.25), which satisﬁes (3.26). Moreover,
suppose that

lim sup
x→∂∞M

supt∈(0,T ] hq(x, t)[u1−q(x, t) − h1−q(x, t)]

|Z(x)|

≤ 0 .

(3.28)

Then (3.4) and (3.7) hold.

Theorem 3.5 Let q < 0. Let Ω ⊆ M be an open not relatively compact connected subset. Let
V ∈ C(QT ). Suppose that u ∈ C 2,1(QT ) ∩ C( ¯QT ) satisﬁes (3.9) and (3.18). Let condition (3.10)
be satisﬁed. Let there exist µ > 0 and a subsolution Z of equation (3.25), which satisﬁes (3.26).
Moreover, suppose that

lim sup
x→∂∞M

supt∈(0,T ] u1−q(x, t)

|Z(x)|

≤ 0 .

(3.29)

Then (3.19) and (3.20) hold.

Remark 3.6 It is easily seen that both condition (3.28) and (3.29) are weaker than condition
(??).

4 Auxiliary results

This section is devoted to some preliminary results that will be used to prove Theorems 3.1, 3.2,
3.3 .

Lemma 4.1 Let v, h ∈ C 2,1(QT ), φ ∈ C 2(I) with v(QT ) ⊆ I, I being an interval in IR. Then

∂t[hφ(v)] − ∆[hφ(v)]

Moreover, in view of (2.1) with f = h, g = φ(v), and in view of (2.2) with w = v we get

∂t[hφ(v)] = φ′(v)∂t(hv) + [φ(v) − vφ′(v)]∂th .

∆[hφ(v)] = φ(v)∆h + h[φ′(v)∆v + φ′′(v)|∇v|2] + 2φ′(v)h∇h,∇vi .

Thus

∆[hφ(v)] = φ′(v)∆(hv)

¿From (4.3) and (4.4) we easily obtain (4.1), and then (4.2).

Let V ∈ C(QT ), q ∈ IR \ {0}. If

∂tu − ∆u + V uq ≥ ∂th − ∆h in QT ,

then

(4.22)

Let us only consider the case when Ω is not relatively compact; the case when Ω is relatively
compact is easier and it will be omitted.
Let k ∈ N that will be taken arbitrary large later on. Fixed a point o ∈ M , by (4.19), we ﬁnd a

Since v ∈ C( ¯QT ) we can therefore take Ωk ⊆ Ω ∩ BRk (o) so that

For each k ﬁxed, the construction of Ωk can be carried out just observing that v is uniformly
continuous in Ω∩ BRk(o) and exploiting the boundary datum. With no loss of generality we may
and do assume that Rk → ∞, Ωk is smooth and

Therefore, by construction, we have that v is a supersolution of the problem

Proposition 4.6 Let Ω ⊂ M be an open subset. Assume that g ∈ C(QT ) and that (4.17) is

Then

v(x, t) ≤ S Ω[g](x, t)

for every x ∈ Ω, t ∈ [0, T ] .

(4.32)

(4.33)

The proof of Proposition 4.6 is analogous to that of Proposition 4.5; the only diﬀerence is

that the sequence {gn} satisﬁes

gn ≥ g , gn ≥ gn+1

in QT

for every n ∈ N ,

(4.34)

instead of (4.21).

Moreover, we use the next reﬁned comparison principles.

Proposition 4.7 Let Ω ⊂ M be an open, not relatively compact subset. Assume that g ∈ C(QT ),
and that (4.17) is satisﬁed. Let v ∈ C 2(QT )∩ C( ¯QT ) be a subsolution of problem (4.18). Assume
that there exists a subsolution Z of equation (3.25) such that (3.26) is satisﬁed. Furthermore,
suppose that

lim sup

Then (4.33) holds.

Proof . First of all we observe that we can assume that, for some H > 0,

In fact, if supΩ Z ≥ 0, then instead of Z we can consider the function

Choose now a sequence of functions {gn} such that gn is locally Lipschitz continuous in QT
for every n ∈ N, (4.34) and (4.22) hold. Let k ∈ N that will be taken arbitrary large later on and
ﬁx a point o ∈ M . We set

(4.40)

With such a construction we let vn,k and pk as in (4.27). It is now easy to verify that Vk is a

Exploiting (4.42) and (4.34) we can infer that v − vn,k is a subsolution of problem (4.41) and,

in (cid:2)∂Ωk × (0, T ](cid:3) ∪(cid:2)Ωk × {0}(cid:3) .

v − vn,k ≤ Vk

by the comparison principle, we obtain that

v − vn,k ≤ Vk

in Ωk × (0, T ] .

Letting n → ∞, k → ∞ in (4.43) we deduce that
v ≤ S Ω[g]

in QT .

Similarly, the next reﬁned comparison principle can also be shown.

Proposition 4.8 Let Ω ⊂ M be an open, not relatively compact subset. Assume that g ∈ C(QT )

4.1 Pointwise estimates in relatively compact domains with general smooth

supersolutions

Let h ∈ C 2,1(QT ) ∩ C( ¯QT ) be a function that satisﬁes (1.10), (1.11) . Consider the following

and

(q < 0)

(4.46)

The next result has a crucial role in the proof of Theorem 3.1. In fact, it gives the estimates
(3.3)-(3.7), under the extra assumption that Ω is relatively compact; moreover, a general smooth
function h that satisﬁes (1.10)-(1.11) is used.

Theorem 4.9 Let Ω ⊆ M be a relatively compact connected subset. Let h be any function
belonging to C 2,1(QT ) ∩ C( ¯QT ) that satisﬁes (1.10)-(1.11). Let u ∈ C 2,1(QT ) ∩ C( ¯QT ) be a
solution of either (4.45) or (4.46).

Moreover, assume that

S Ω[hq|V |](x, t) < ∞ for all (x, t) ∈ QT ,

if q < 0 or q ≥ 1,

or that

S Ω[χuhq|V |] < ∞ for all (x, t) ∈ QT ,

if 0 < q < 1 .

Then (3.3)–(3.7) hold for all (x, t) ∈ QT .
Proof of Theorem 4.9 . To begin with, we further assume that

Following the proof of [10, Theorem 3.2], we choose a function φ to solve the initial value problem

h > 0, u > 0 in ¯QT , and V ∈ C( ¯QT ) .

(4.47)

For q = 1 we have

while for q 6= 1 we obtain

φ′(s) = φ(s)q, φ(0) = 1 .

φ(s) = es ,

In particular, we have

φ′ > 0 in Iq ;

consequently, the inverse function φ−1 : (0,∞) → R is well-deﬁned . Moreover,

whereas

φ′′(s) > 0

in Iq if q > 0 ,

φ′′(s) < 0

in Iq if q < 0 .

(4.51)

(4.52)

(4.53)

(4.54)

(4.55)

Indeed, for 0 < q < 1, we extend the domain of φ to all s ≤ − 1

φ(s) = [(1 − q)s + 1]

for all s ∈ R .

(4.56)

Due to (4.47), we can deﬁne

(4.57)
we have that v ∈ C 2,1(QT )∩ C( ¯QT ) . Let q > 0. From (1.10) and (4.45) we have that the function
u = hφ(v) satisﬁes
(4.58)

∂tu − ∆u + V uq ≥ ∂th − ∆h ≥ 0 in QT .

v := φ−1(cid:16) u

h(cid:17) in ¯QT ;

Thanks to (4.58), Lemma 4.3 and (4.48) we get

∂t(hv) − ∆(hv) ≥ −hqV
Since u ≥ h in (cid:2)∂Ω × (0, T ](cid:3) ∪(cid:2)Ω × {0}(cid:3), we have that

in QT .

hv = hφ−1(cid:16) u

h(cid:17) ≥ hφ−1(1) = 0

in (cid:2)∂Ω × (0, T ](cid:3) ∪(cid:2)Ω × {0}(cid:3) .

(4.59)

(4.60)

So, hv is a supersolution of problem (4.18) with g = −hqV . Since Ω is relatively compact, by
Proposition 4.5,
(4.61)

in QT .

hv ≥ −S Ω[hqV ]

Thus,

v ≥ −

1
hS[hqV ]

in QT .

As a consequence of (4.57) and (4.62) we obtain that, for q > 1,

v <

1
q − 1

, −h−1S Ω[hqV ] <

1
q − 1

.

15

(4.62)

(4.63)

Hence, for each q > 0, we can apply φ to both sides of (4.62) to obtain

u

h ≤ φ(cid:18)−

1

hS Ω[hqV ](cid:19) in QT ,

which implies (3.3), (3.5), (3.6) . Moreover, from (4.63) it follows (3.4) .

Now, assume that q < 0. Then we have

Thanks to Lemma 4.3 and (4.15) we have

∂tu − ∆u + V uq ≤ ∂th − ∆h in QT .

∂t(hv) − ∆(hv) ≤ −hqV
Since u ≤ h in (cid:2)∂Ω × (0, T ](cid:3) ∪(cid:2)Ω × {0}(cid:3), we have that

in QT .

hv = hφ−1(cid:16) u

h(cid:17) ≤ hφ−1(1) = 0

in (cid:2)∂Ω × (0, T ](cid:3) ∪(cid:2)Ω × {0}(cid:3) .

(4.64)

(4.65)

(4.66)

So, hv is a subsolution of problem (4.18) with g = −hqV . Since Ω is bounded, by Proposition 4.6,

Thus,

hv ≤ −S Ω[hqV ]

in QT .

v ≤ −

1
hS Ω[hqV ]

in QT .

In view of (4.67), it follows (3.4). Moreover, applying φ to both sides of (4.67) we get

u

h ≥ φ(cid:18)−

1

hS Ω[hqV ](cid:19) in QT ,

and then (3.7) .

(4.67)

(4.68)

Now we can remove the extra assumptions in (4.47). We extend the domain Iq of φ to the
endpoints of Iq by taking the limits of φ at the endpoints. So, the extended domain of φ is the
interval

if q > 1 ,

if

q = 1 ,

Moreover, when 0 < q < 1, we extend φ to all s ∈ [−∞,∞] by using (4.56) . Hence (3.3), (3.5)
and (3.6) can be written in the form (4.64), while (3.20) in the form (4.68).

Take q > 0. Let us show (4.64). To this purpose, for every ε > 0 set

and deﬁne

uε := u + ε

vε := φ−1(cid:16) uε

h (cid:17) in QT .

16

Note that since uε > 0 and h > 0 in QT , the function vε is well-deﬁned in QT and vε ∈ C 2,1(QT );
moreover, vε(QT ) ⊂ Iq . From (4.2) it follows that

∂t(hvε) − ∆(hvε)

∂t[hφ(vε)] − ∆[hφ(vε)]

φ(vε)

φ′(vε)(cid:19) (∂th − ∆h)

in QT .

(4.69)

Since

we get

By (4.48),

∂t[hφ(vε)] − ∆[hφ(vε)] = ∂tuε − ∆uε = ∂tu − ∆u in QT ,

∂t(hvε) − ∆(hvε)

in QT .

φ′(vε) = φ(vε)q = (cid:16) uε
h (cid:17)q

¿From (4.70), (4.71) and (4.45) we obtain

φ′(vε) |∇vε|2h +(cid:18)vε −

φ′(vε) (cid:19) (∂th − ∆h)

in QT .

In view of (1.10), (1.11) and (4.12), the previous inequality implies

∂t(hvε) − ∆(hvε) ≥ −hq(cid:18) u

uε(cid:19)q

If q > 0, q 6= 1, from (4.50) we have that

(4.73)

Let (x0, t0) ∈ (cid:2)∂Ω × (0, T ](cid:3) ∪(cid:2)Ω × {0}(cid:3). Since u, h ∈ C( ¯QT ), in view of (4.45) we have that

uε(x0, t0) ≥ h(x0, t0) + ε > h(x0, t0) .

(4.74)

¿From (4.73) and (4.74) we deduce that

h(x, t)vε(x, t) =

1 − q(cid:2)hq(x0, t0)u1−q

(x0, t0) − h(x0, t0)(cid:3) ≥ 0 .

(4.75)

For q = 1, we have that φ−1(s) = log s, hence

hvε = h log(cid:16) uε

h (cid:17) in QT .

(4.76)

17

If h(x0, t0) > 0, then we have

lim

(x,t)→(x0,t0)

h(x, t)vε(x, t) = h(x0, t0) log(cid:18) uε(x0, t0)

h(x0, t0) (cid:19) > 0 ,

while if h(x0, t0) = 0, then from (4.76), since uε ≥ ε, we have that

lim

(x,t)→(x0,t0)

h(x, t)vε(x, t) = 0 .

¿From (4.75), (4.77) and (4.78) we can infer that hvε ∈ C 2,1(QT ) ∩ C( ¯QT ), and

Note that since

we can infer that S Ωhhq (cid:16) u

V ∈ C(QT ). Hence, in

Therefore,

vε ≥ −

We claim that, if q ≥ 1, then

In fact, from (4.80) we obtain

u > 0 in QT .

Observe that

h (cid:17) ∈ Iq , −

hS Ω[hqV +] ⊂ [−∞, 0] ⊆ ¯Iq .

Hence we can apply φ to both sides of (4.82) to get

(4.80)

(4.81)

(4.82)

(4.83)

(4.84)

Since S Ω[hqV +](x, t) < ∞ for every (x, t) ∈ QT , from (4.84) we can infer that (4.81) is satisﬁed,
and the Claim has been shown.

Now, observe that since

vε ∈ Iq, −

1

hS Ω(cid:20)hq(cid:18) u

uε(cid:19)q

V(cid:21) ∈ ¯Iq,

we can apply φ to both sides of (4.80) to get

In particular, we have that

(4.86)

(4.87)

from which (4.64) immediately follows. Hence (3.3) and (3.5) have been proved. Furthermore, if

Assume now that q < 0. For every ε > 0 we deﬁne

vε := φ−1(cid:18) u

hεvε ≤ 0 in (cid:2)∂Ω × (0, T ](cid:3) ∪(cid:2)Ω × {0}(cid:3) .

Hence from Lemma 4.3 and (4.48) we have that

∂tu − ∆u + V uq ≤ ∂thε − ∆hε

Letting ε → 0+, by the monotone convergence theorem we obtain

(4.97)

Since S Ω[hqV ] is well-deﬁned in QT , letting ε → 0+ in (4.96), we have (3.7). Since we have
assumed that u > 0 in QT , from (3.7) it follows (3.4) .

(cid:3)

5 Proof of Theorems 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3

Proof of Theorem 3.1 . At ﬁrst, let us show that it is not restrictive to suppose that f is locally
Lipschitz continuous in QT . In fact, suppose only that f is continuous in QT . Let q > 0. Choose
a sequence of nonnegative locally Lipschitz functions {fn} such that

and

Set

fn ≤ f

in QT ,

fn → f

in QT as n → ∞ .

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)
Note that for every n ∈ N, hn ∈ C 2,1(QT ) ∩ C( ¯QT ) solves (1.10) and (1.11). Moreover, we have
that
(5.4)

hn := RΩ[fn] .

hn ≤ h, hn → h in QT as n → ∞ ,

where h is deﬁned in (1.7). Since

we obtain that S Ω[hq

nV ] < ∞ in QT for every n ∈ N. We have that

S Ω[hq

n|V |] ≤ S Ω[hq|V |]

in QT ,

and that

S Ω[hq

nV ] → S Ω[hqV ]

in QT ,

S Ω[χuhq

nV ] → S Ω[χuhqV ]

in QT .

In view of (5.1) we deduce that

∂tu − ∆u + V uq ≥ fn

in QT .

(5.5)

(5.6)

Therefore, if (3.3)-(3.6) hold with h replaced by hn given by (5.3) and f replaced by fn, then,
thanks to (5.4) and (5.5), we have that (3.3), (3.5) and (3.6) hold with h given by (1.7). Moreover,
we get

− (q − 1)S Ω[hqV ] ≤ h in QT .

(5.7)

21

However, from (3.5) it follows that (5.7) must hold with a strict inequality; thus, (3.4) has been
shown.

If q < 0, then the claim follows arguing in the same way, if instead of condition (5.1) we

require that

(5.8)
Hence, for all q 6= 0, we can assume that f is locally Lipschitz continuous in QT . Now, let q > 0.
Choose a sequence of subsets {Ωn} ⊂⊂ Ω such that

fn ≥ f

in QT .

Ωn is relatively compact, connected, open and with ∂Ωn smooth for every n ∈ N,

n=1Ωn = Ω .
We have that hn := RΩn[f ; u0] ∈ C 2,1(Ωn × (0, T ]) ∩ C( ¯Ωn × [0, T ]), and

Ωn ⊂ Ωn+1 for every n ∈ N , ∪∞

∂thn − ∆hn = f
hn = 0

hn = u0

in ∂Ωn × (0, T ]




We can always take n big enough so that f 6≡ 0 in Ωn, and so,

By the monotone convergence theorem,

0 < hn < ∞ in QT .

In view of (1.6) and (5.11) we have that

hn → h = RΩ[f ; u0]

in QT , as n → ∞ .

in QT as n → ∞ ,

S Ωn[χnhq

nV ±] → S Ω[χuhqV ±]

in QT as n → ∞ .

Passing to the limit as n → ∞ in (5.13) gives (3.3), (3.5) and (3.6) . Let q > 1. Then from (5.14)
we have that

1 + (q − 1)

1
hS Ω[hqV ] ≥ 0 .

However, since − 1

q−1 < 0 and u

h < ∞, the previous inequality yields (3.4) .

It remains to prove (3.6) . Let q < 0. Note that since f is locally Lipschitz in QT , RΩ[f ] ∈
C 2,1(QT ). In fact, for every relatively compact subset Ω′ ⊂ Ω with ∂Ω′ smooth, we clearly have
that RΩ′[f ] ∈ C 2,1(Ω′ × (0, T ]). Moreover, the function w := RΩ[f ] − RΩ′[f ] solves in the weak
sense
(5.15)
Hence, by standard regularity results, w ∈ C 2,1(Ω′× (0, T ]). Therefore, RΩ[f ] ∈ C 2,1(Ω′× (0, T ]) .
Since Ω′ was arbitrary, the claim follows. For any ε > 0 deﬁne

∂tw − ∆w = 0 in Ω′ × (0, T ] .

We have that

hε := ε + RΩ[f ; u0] .

∂thε − ∆hε = f
Since u > 0, hε > 0 in QT , the function vε := φ−1(cid:16) u

in the proof of Theorem 4.9, we obtain

in QT .

hε(cid:17) ∈ C 2,1(QT ). By the same arguments as

¿From (4.90) we get

∂t(hεvε) − ∆(hεvε) ≤ −hq

hεvε ≤ 0 in (cid:2)∂Ω × (0, T ](cid:3) ∪(cid:2)Ω × {0}(cid:3) .

(5.24)

Letting ε → 0+, the thesis follows by the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem 4.9-(iv).
This completes the proof.
Proof of Theorem 3.2 . Let {Ωn} be a sequence of domains as in (5.9)-(5.10). Let q ≥ 1. For
every n ∈ N, let hn ∈ C 2,1(QT ) ∩ C( ¯QT ) be the solution of problem

(cid:3)

∂thn − ∆hn = 0 in Ωn × (0, T ]
hn = u

in ∂Ωn × (0, T ]
in Ωn × {0} .

hn = u




In view of (3.12) and (3.14), by the maximum principle,

hn > 0

in QT .

Thanks to (4.81), we can infer that u(x) > 0 for all x ∈ Ωn, t ∈ (0, T ]; therefore, u(x) > 0 for all
(x, t) ∈ QT .

Let q = 1. Set h ≡ 1, v := log u. As in the proof of Theorem 4.9, we have

¿From (3.12) we can deduce that

∂tv − ∆v ≥ −V

in QT .

and

v ≥ 0 in (cid:2)∂Ω × (0, T ](cid:3) ∪(cid:2)Ω × {0}(cid:3) ,

lim inf
x→∂∞M

inf

t∈(0,T ]

v(x, t) ≥ 0 .

Thus, we can apply Proposition 4.5 with g = −V , and we have

log u(x, t) = v(x, t) ≥ −S Ω[V ](x, t)

for all (x, t) ∈ QT .

(5.25)

¿From (5.25), inequality (3.13) immediately follows.

Now, let q > 1. Set

In view of (3.14) we have that

αn :=

inf

[∂Ωn×(0,T ]]∪[Ωn×{0}]

lim
n→∞

αn = ∞ .

We can apply Theorem 4.9 with h ≡ αn. Therefore,

24

(5.26)

(5.27)

(5.28)

Hence, letting n → ∞ in (5.28) we get S Ω[V ](x) ≥ 0. Therefore, by the monotone convergence
theorem, (5.27) implies (3.16). Since u(x) < ∞, (3.15) follows.

Now, let 0 < q < 1. We set

φ(v) := [(1 − q)v]

1−q

+ ,

v ∈ R.

Thus

φ′(v) > 0, φ′′(v) > 0

for all v > 0 .

Moreover, (4.48) holds. Consider a sequence {εn} ⊂ (0,∞) with εn → 0 as n → ∞. For every
n ∈ N deﬁne

un := u + εn, vn := φ−1(un) .

In view of Remark 4.4 with h ≡ 1, by the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem 4.9, we
have

Since

(5.29)

Letting n → ∞, by the monotone convergence theorem we get
in QT ,

φ−1(u) ≥ −S[χuV ]

which is equivalent to (3.17).

Now, let q < 0. For every n ∈ N set
νn :=

sup

u .

In view of (3.18) and (3.1) we have that

νn = 0 .

u(x, t) ≤ (cid:8)ν1−q

Letting n → ∞ in (5.31) we get (3.20). Moreover, since u > 0 in QT , we obtain (3.19). This
completes the proof.

for all (x, t) ∈ QT .

(5.31)

In order to prove Theorem 3.3 we use the standard method of sub– and supersolutions; namely,

if there exists u, u ∈ C 2,1(QT ) ∩ C( ¯QT ) such that

0 ≤ u ≤ u in QT ,

u = 0,

u ≥ 0 in ∂Ω × (0, T ] ,

25

(5.32)

(5.33)

and

u ≤ u0 ≤ u in Ω × {0} .

∂tu − ∆u + V uq ≤ f
∂tu − ∆u + V uq ≥ f

in QT ,

in QT ,

then there exists a solution u ∈ C 2,1(QT ) ∩ C( ¯QT ) of problem (1.9) such that

u ≤ u ≤ u in QT .

(5.34)

(5.35)

(5.36)

(5.37)

Proof of Theorem 3.3 . We limit ourselves to prove the statement (ii), since the statement (i) can
be proved in a similar and simpler way.

Let

In view of the regularity assumptions on f and on ∂Ω, we have that u ∈ C 2,1(QT )∩ C( ¯QT ) solves

u ≡ h = RΩ[f ; u0] .

∂tu − ∆u = f
u = 0

u = u0

in QT

in ∂Ω × (0, T ] .
in Ω × {0} .




Moreover, since V ≥ 0, f ≥ 0, we have that u satisﬁes (5.36). Hence u is a supersolution of
problem (1.9).

Now, we look for a subsolution u of problem (1.9). To this aim, deﬁne

u := h − λqS Ω[hqV ]

in QT ,

where λ > 0 is a positive parameter to be ﬁxed in the sequel. Thanks to (3.23) we have that if
we take

,

(5.38)

then

0 < λ < −

q(1 − q)
1 − q

u > 0 in QT .

1
q

Hence, (5.32) holds. We claim that u ∈ C 2,1(QT ) ∩ C( ¯QT ) . In fact, for every relatively compact
subset Ω′ ⊂ Ω with ∂Ω′ smooth, since h > 0 in ¯Ω′, we have that S Ω′[hqV ] ∈ C 2,1(Ω′ × (0, T ]).
Moreover, the function w := S Ω[hqV ] − S Ω′
[hqV ] solves (5.15) in the weak sense. Hence, by
standard regularity results, w ∈ C 2,1(Ω′ × (0, T ]). Therefore, S Ω[hqV ] ∈ C 2,1(Ω′ × (0, T ]) .
Since Ω′ was arbitrary, the claim follows. Furthermore, since h ∈ C( ¯QT ) and h = 0 in (cid:2)∂Ω ×
(0, T ](cid:3) ∪ (cid:2)Ω × {0}(cid:3), using (3.23) we can deduce that S Ω[hqV ] ∈ C( ¯QT ) and S Ω[hqV ] = 0 in
(cid:2)∂Ω × (0, T ](cid:3) ∪(cid:2)Ω × {0}(cid:3).

Now, let us show that u satisﬁes (5.35). Note that

∂tu − ∆u + V uq = f − λqhqV + uqV
Hence, since V ≥ 0 and q < 0, (3.24) follows, if we show that

in QT .

λh ≤ u,

26

that is

S Ω[hqV ] ≤ λ−q(1 − λ)h .

(5.39)

Now, it is easily checked that (3.23) yields (5.39), by taking λ = 1
1− 1
q
a solution u ∈ C 2,1(QT ) ∩ C( ¯QT ) of problem (1.9) such that (5.37) is satisﬁed. Therefore,

This combined with Theorem 3.1-(iv) gives (3.24). The proof is complete.

6 Proof of Theorems 3.4 and 3.5

Proof of Theorem 3.4 . By the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem 3.1, and using the
same notations, we can infer that, for any ε > 0, (5.16) and (5.22) hold. In view of (5.17) and
(3.28) we have that for any ε > 0

Due to (6.40) we can apply Proposition 4.7 with g = −hq

Proof of Theorem 3.5 . Choose a sequence of not relatively compact domains {Ωn}n∈N with
smooth boundary such that

(6.42)

For each n ∈ N set h := νn. Since u > 0, h > 0 in QT , the function v := φ−1(cid:0) u

here φ−1 is given by (4.90). By the same arguments as in the proof of Theorem 4.9, we obtain

h(cid:1) ∈ C 2,1(QT );

¿From (4.90) we get

¿From (6.41) we can infer that

∂t(hv) − ∆(hv) ≤ −hqV

hv = hφ−1(cid:16) u

h(cid:17) = hq u1−q − h1−q

Moreover, due to (6.44) and (3.29) we have that

hv ≤ 0 in (cid:2)∂Ωn × (0, T ](cid:3) ∪(cid:2)Ωn × {0}(cid:3) .

Therefore, for each n ∈ N we can apply can apply Proposition 4.7 with g = −hqV to get

Hence by Theorem 4.9 in Ωn with h ≡ νn we obtain

(6.48)
Letting n → ∞ in (6.48), using (6.41), we get (3.20). Moreover, since u > 0 in QT , we obtain
