ABSTRACT

We discovered two transient events in the Kepler ﬁeld with light curves that strongly suggest they
are type II-P supernovae. Using the fast cadence of the Kepler observations we precisely estimate
the rise time to maximum for KSN2011a and KSN2011d as 10.5±0.4 and 13.3±0.4 rest-frame days
respectively. Based on ﬁts to idealized analytic models, we ﬁnd the progenitor radius of KSN2011a
(280±20 R(cid:12)) to be signiﬁcantly smaller than that for KSN2011d (490±20 R(cid:12)) but both have similar
explosion energies of 2.0±0.3 × 1051 erg.

The rising light curve of KSN2011d is an excellent match to that predicted by simple models of
exploding red supergiants (RSG). However, the early rise of KSN2011a is faster than the models
predict possibly due to the supernova shockwave moving into pre-existing wind or mass-loss from the
RSG. A mass loss rate of 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1 from the RSG can explain the fast rise without impacting
the optical ﬂux at maximum light or the shape of the post-maximum light curve.

No shock breakout emission is seen in KSN2011a, but this is likely due to the circumstellar inter-
action suspected in the fast rising light curve. The early light curve of KSN2011d does show excess
emission consistent with model predictions of a shock breakout. This is the ﬁrst optical detection of
a shock breakout from a type II-P supernova.

INTRODUCTION

Type II-P supernovae (SNIIP) result from the core-
collapse of supergiant stars with signiﬁcant hydrogen en-
velopes. Stars exceeding about eight times the mass of
the Sun evolve to produce an iron core which can not
be supported against gravity and the resulting collapse
drives a shock wave that disrupts the star. Details of
how the gravitational energy is converted to an explo-
sion driven by an outward propagating shock is not com-
pletely understood, and may require core accretion in-
stabilities (Blondin et al. 2003) or additional energy de-
position by neutrinos (Bethe & Wilson 1985). However,
there is clear observational evidence from archival stud-
ies of nearby SNIIP that their progenitors are supergiant
stars with radii several hundred times that of the Sun
(see Smartt 2015, for a review).

When the shock generated by the core-collapse reaches
the surface of the star, a bright ﬂash of hard radiation is
expected (Klein & Chevalier 1978; Falk 1978). The time-
scale for shock breakout is roughly the time it takes light
to traverse the stellar radius (Nakar & Sari 2010). For

typical supergiants this timescale is less than an hour,
meaning shock breakouts are very diﬃcult to observe di-
rectly. Strong indirect evidence for a hard radiation from
a breakout in a SNIIP comes from the ionized circum-
stellar rings around SN 1987A (Fransson 1989). For-
tuitously, shock breakouts in two SNIIP have recently
been directly detected using the ultraviolet capabilities
of the GALEX satellite (Schawinski et al. 2008; Gezari
et al. 2015) . Both of these UV observed shock breakouts
lasted signiﬁcantly longer than an hour implying either
the supergiant has an extremely large radius or the pres-
ence of circumstellar material prolonged the UV emission
(Ofek et al. 2010; Chevalier & Irwin 2011).

After shock breakout the bulk of the exploded star ex-
pands and the eﬀective temperature drops. The compe-
tition between the increasing size of the photosphere and
the falling temperature determines the early light curve
on the time-scale of a few days. For simple assumptions
of a ﬁxed density proﬁle and constant opacity dominated
by electron scattering, the photospheric radius and tem-
perature can be parameterized by the progenitor mass,
radius and explosion energy (Nakar & Sari 2010; Rabinak
& Waxman 2011). Approaching maximum light these
simple assumptions break down, and detailed modeling
is required to account for opacity variations with depth
and wavelength (e.g. Dessart et al. 2013). So observa-
tions of the early light curve are important in constrain-
ing progenitor properties while relying on a minimum of
assumptions.

A recent study of the rise time of SNIIP has suggested
that their progenitors are typically smaller than super-
giants cataloged in the Galaxy (Gonzalez-Gaitan et al.
2015). Some of this discrepancy could be due to selection
bias in the catalogs since larger stars at a given tempera-

probable type IIn event (Garnavich et al. 2016), and the
supernovae presented here. Unfortunately the timescale
for release of Kepler data meant that follow-up of the
events was not possible from ground-based observato-
ries. We did obtain spectra of the host galaxies which
provide redshifts of the supernovae and information on
the environment around the progenitors (Tucker et al.
2016).

On a timescale of minutes to hours, Kepler provides
photometric precision of a few parts in a million for
bright sources. However, on longer timescales, various
systematic eﬀects considerably reduce the precision of
the standard Kepler products. For example, the Kepler
observations were organized in three-month segments la-
beled quarters Q0 to Q16. Each quarter the spacecraft
rotated to keep the Sun on the Solar panels resulting in
the targets shifting to diﬀerent detectors. About once per
month, the spacecraft goes through a pointing maneuver
to downlink the data to Earth. Signiﬁcant sensitivity
variations in the pipeline light curves after re-pointing
maneuvers are removed through special processing. De-
tails of our Kepler reduction procedures can be found in
Olling et al. (2015); Shaya et al. (2015).

3. LIGHT CURVES

KSN 2011a was discovered in the galaxy KIC8480662
which is a bright 2MASS galaxy at a redshift of z = 0.051
(Tucker et al. 2016). The Kepler light curve shows a fast
rise, a broad maximum followed by a long plateau (see
Fig. 1). Finally there is a rapid decay followed by an
exponential decline. The light curve is characteristic of
SNIIP.

KSN 2011d was discovered in the galaxy KIC10649106
which is also a 2MASS cataloged galaxy at a redshift of
z = 0.087 (Tucker et al. 2016). Its light curve also shows
a fast rise, a broad maximum and then a slow decay
before falling oﬀ the “plateau” after 130 days. KSN2011d
appears to fade faster on the plateau than KSN2011a,
but part of that can be attributed to the higher redshift
which means the bandpass contains bluer light that fades
more quickly in SNIIP. A detailed analysis of the full light
curves can be found in Tucker et al. (2016).

These Kepler supernovae light curves are very similar
to several well-observed SNIIP events such as SN1999em
(Suntzeﬀ, private com.), SN1999gi (Leonard et al. 2002)
and SN2012aw (Bose et al. 2013). The Kepler super-
novae are at signiﬁcantly higher redshifts than these lo-
cal events, so k-corrections are important, but there is
no color information for the Kepler events. Therefore,
we use the BV RI magnitudes of the nearby supernovae
to correct them to the Kepler observed frame.

For the nearby supernovae we create a spectral energy
distribution (SED) for each epoch observed in multiple
ﬁlters. Missing ﬁlters are interpolated from adjacent
epochs. The SEDs are corrected for Milky Way extinc-
tion using Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner (2011). The SED is
corrected to the redshift of the Kepler events, convolved
with the Kepler bandpass and the result is integrated to
give the total photon ﬂux. The result is also reddened
to match the Milky Way extinction in the direction of
the Kepler supernova. Kepler magnitudes are in the AB
system, so the Kepler bandpass is convolved with a spec-
trum with constant Fν = 3631 Jy and integrated to de-
termine the magnitude zeropoint.

Fig. 1.— The Kepler light curves of KSN 2011a (top) and
KSN 2011d (bottom). The blue points are magnitudes estimated
from the standard Kepler 30-minute cadence while the large red
symbols show 1-day medians. The small symbols connected by a
line display the light curve of the proto-typical type IIP SN 1999gi
(Leonard et al. 2002) after correction to the redshift of the Ke-
pler events. The initial rise of KSN2011a is clearly faster than
KSN2011d based on the number of red points (1-day median) be-
fore maximum light.

ture are easier to detect than their smaller cousins. Still,
it may be that progenitors of SNIIP are more compact
than thought, or circumstellar interaction makes the rise
time appear shorter than expected.

Here, we present Kepler Space Telescope observations
of two SNIIP candidates. The light curves begin be-
fore explosion and were obtained with unprecedented 30-
minute cadence and good photometric precision. While
these Kepler observations have several advantages over
other studies of SNIIP, the red-sensitive Kepler band-
pass is not ideal for detecting shock breakout radiation.
Further, the way Kepler data was taken made it diﬃcult
to study transient events in “real time”, so little is known
about these supernovae other than their exquisite light
curves which are analyzed in their entirety by Tucker et
al. (2016).

2. OBSERVATIONS

While the primary goal of the Kepler Mission (Haas et
al. 2010) was to ﬁnd and study extra-solar planets, it also
provided nearly continuous observations of many galax-
ies. Several Kepler guest observer projects monitored
about 500 galaxies at 30-min cadence to look for bright-
ness variations in their centers indicative of an active
galactic nucleus or to speciﬁcally search for supernovae.
Targets were selected from the 2MASS extended source
catalog (NASA/IPAC IRSA) and the NASA/IPAC Ex-
tragalactic Database (NED) . Typically, galaxies were
monitored for two to three years leading to the discov-
ery of three type Ia supernovae (Olling et al. 2015), one

30 minute cadence and the red symbols are 6-hour medians. The x-axis shows the redshift corrected time since shock breakout estimated
from the model ﬁt. Note that a shock traversing a red supergiant can take about a day to reach the surface, so we can not measure the time
of core-collapse. Right: The light curve for KSN2011d with a model ﬁt assuming a progenitor radius of 490 R(cid:12). An errorbar at −10 days
indicates the 3-σ uncertainty on the median points. The lower panel shows the residuals to the ﬁt. Left: The light curve of KSN2011a
with a model ﬁt using a progenitor radius of 280 R(cid:12). The model can not match the fast rise early in the light curve and still ﬁt the time
of maximum. The lower panel shows signiﬁcant residuals that decay on a timescale of 5 days.

For comparison, Figure 1 displays the light curve of the
well-observed local event SN 1999gi after correction to
the redshifts of the Kepler supernovae. SN 1999gi was a
slightly fainter than typical SNIIP (Bose et al. 2013), and
ignoring unknown host extinction, it is over a magnitude
fainter than these two Kepler supernovae. Still, the shape
of the light curve and length on the plateau make the
SNIIP classiﬁcation of KSN2011a and KSN2011d very
solid.

4. ANALYSIS

4.1. Rise to Maximum

The rapid cadence of the Kepler observations provide
a unique window on the early rise of supernovae. In par-
ticular, SNIIP have rise times on the order of a week and
are diﬃcult to capture in typical ground-based surveys
(e.g. Gonzalez-Gaitan et al. 2015). In Figure 2, we show
the Kepler light curves beginning several days before ex-
plosion and ending soon after maximum light. There are
approximately 500 individual photometric measurements
between the initial brightening and maximum light. But
these events are at signiﬁcant distance, so we have com-
bined the Kepler cadence into 6-hour median bins to im-
prove the signal-to-noise ratio of the light curves.

To ﬁt the pre-maximum rise of the Kepler events, we
calculated a grid of light curves using the Rabinak &
Waxman (2011) red supergiant (RSG) model. The RSG
model assumes a power-law density structure with an
index n = 3/2. We vary the progenitor radius and ex-
plosion energy keeping the stellar mass at 15 M(cid:12) which
is typical for core-collapse supernovae (Smartt 2015).
We assume fully ionized hydrogen envelopes (κ = 0.34
cm2 g−1) and the set the normalization of the ejecta
density to fp = 0.1, although the results are not sensi-
tive to this parameter. The Rabinak & Waxman (2011)

model allows us to calculate the temperature and radius
of the expanding photosphere as a function of time. For
each epoch we construct a blackbody corrected to the
redshift and distance of the Kepler supernova and multi-
ply the spectrum by the Kepler sensitivity function. We
then integrate and normalize the resulting ﬂux using the
zeropoint calculated in the AB magnitude system. For
each pair of initial radius and explosion energy we have
a light curve from which we derive a rise time and peak
magnitude.

The observed rise time (and uncertainty) deﬁnes a
band in the radius versus energy plane that is nearly
horizontal while the observed magnitude (and error) de-
ﬁnes a band that cuts diagonally across the parameters
of interest. The results for the two Kepler supernovae are
presented in Fig. 3. The intersection of the two bands is
a consistent ﬁt to the rise time and peak brightness (cor-
rected for Milky Way extinction) and tightly constrains
the derived quantities of progenitor radius and explo-
sion energy. We also created model grids for progenitor
masses of 10 and 20 M(cid:12), but the resulting parameters
did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the 15 M(cid:12) calculations.
The model light curves that best match the observed
rise time and peak magnitude are then ﬁt to the ac-
tual light curves by minimizing the residuals between the
model and data. From this a new time of explosion is es-
timated and an improved rise time is calculated. This
iterative method converges quickly and the resulting ﬁts
are shown in Fig. 2.

For KSN2011d, the Rabinak & Waxman (2011) model
with a progenitor radius of 490 R(cid:12) and explosion energy
of 2±0.3 B8 not only matches the rise time and peak
magnitude, but the Rabinak & Waxman (2011) model

Fig. 3.— Constraints on the progenitor size and explosion energy based on the observed light curve rise time and peak magnitude. In
the Rabinak & Waxman (2011) models for red supergiants, the rise time of the light curve (red) is good at constraining the progenitor size,
while the peak brightness (blue) is best at limiting the range of explosion energies. The widths of the bands represent the uncertainties in
the observed quantities. The supernova luminosities have been corrected for Milky Way extinction but no host reddening has been assumed.
Here a progenitor mass of 15 M(cid:12) is assumed, but the results are not sensitive to mass for the range of 10 to 20 M(cid:12). Left: For KSN2011a

predicts the overall shape of the rise very well. The χ2
parameter of the best ﬁt model is 1532 for 1142 free pa-
rameters or a reduced χ2
The best ﬁt rise time for KSN2011a is 280±20 R(cid:12) and
the explosion energy is also 2±0.3 B. Kasen & Woosley
(2009) found that only a few nearby SNIIP events had en-
ergies larger than 1.5 B, so ﬁnding two Kepler supernovae
with explosion energies of 2 B is surprising. But the Ke-
pler supernova search is likely biased toward discovering
luminous events near the limiting magnitude of the sur-
vey and these will tend to have higher explosion ener-
gies than supernovae found in volume limited searches of
nearby events.

over a longer time. Strong circumstellar interaction has
been successful in explaining very luminous events (Ofek
et al. 2010; Chevalier & Irwin 2011), but progenitors with
low mass loss rates may also see their early light curves
enhanced with a weak shock interaction (Moriya et al.
2011).
Moriya et al. (2011) calculations show that mass loss
rates of order 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1 will cause the early light
curve to rise faster than a bare RSG, while not strongly
aﬀecting the optical peak luminosity or the light curve
during the plateau. Mass-loss rates less than 10−4
M(cid:12) yr−1 mean that the circumstellar medium near the
progenitor radius is too low density to become optically
thick when the shock hits it, so the presence of the wind
would have no signiﬁcant impact on the light curve even
during the early rise. We therefore expect that the mild
interaction seen in KSN2011a is due to a mass-loss rate
just above the 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1 threshold.

No correction has been made for possible host extinc-
tion because colors are not measured for these events.
The explosion energy will be the parameter most aﬀected
by our uncertainty in host reddening and in our analy-
sis we are actually estimating its lower limit. Poznanski
et al. (2009) estimated the color excess for forty SNIIP
events and from that sample we infer a median visual
extinction of 0.80 mag. We note that this sample of rel-
atively nearby SNIIP may not be representative of the
magnitude-limited Kepler discoveries, but it does suggest
signiﬁcant extinction is not unusual for SNIIP.

The shape of the KSN2011a light curve is not as well
ﬁt by the Rabinak & Waxman (2011) prediction (left
panel of Fig. 2) even when the time to maximum and
peak magnitude are well matched. In the ﬁrst ﬁve days
the KSN2011a light curve rises signiﬁcantly faster than
the model even though the same physics resulted in an
excellent ﬁt to the KSN2011d light curve. Assuming a
smaller progenitor radius does make the model rise faster,
but that model will then peak much earlier than the ob-
served 10.5 days. Smaller assumed radii also produce a
poor ﬁt near maximum light for blue supergiant (BSG)
models which diﬀer from RSG in their density proﬁle.

The rapid rise in KSN2011a and the “extra light”
above the Rabinak & Waxman (2011) model photosphere
suggests the supernova shock continued to propagate into
circumstellar material allowing it to convert more kinetic
energy into luminosity and diﬀuse the shock breakout

4.2. Shock Breakout

4.2.1. KSN2011a

The fast cadence and continuous coverage of Kepler
should, in principle, allow us to see the shock breakouts
in these SNIIP. In the case of KSN2011a where we sus-
pect circumstellar interaction, the shock breakout was
likely reprocessed over the diﬀusion time in the optically
thick wind. The shock continued into the wind and con-
verted additional kinetic energy into luminosity that we
see as excess ﬂux during the photospheric rise. The peak
absolute Kepler magnitude from the circumstellar inter-
action is MKp = −15.5 mag, but much of the total energy
is likely emitted at shorter wavelengths.

4.2.2. KSN2011d

In the KSN2011d light curve (Fig. 2), there is a single
6-hour median ﬂux point that deviates from the light
curve model by 4 standard deviations (σ) at the time
expected for shock breakout. A close-up of this time
period is shown in Fig. 4 using a binning width of 3.5
hours. Extrapolating the Rabinak & Waxman (2011)

Fig. 4.— Left: The Kepler light curve of KSN2011d focused on the time expected for shock breakout. The blue dots are individual Kepler
measurements and the red symbols show 3.5-hour medians of the Kepler data. An errorbar at −1.5 days indicates the 3-σ uncertainty
on the median points.The green line shows the best ﬁt photospheric model light curve. The lower panel displays the residuals between
the observations and the model ﬁt. The thick red line is a Gaussian smoothed residual light curve using a full-width at half-maxmimum
of two hours. The dashed red lines indicate 3σ deviations of the Gaussian smoothed curve. The residual at the time expected for shock
breakout is more than 5σ implying that the feature is unlikely to be a random ﬂuctuation. Right: A simulated light curve created using
the statistical properties of the Kepler photometry and the best ﬁt photospheric model. In addition, a Nakar & Sari (2010) shock breakout
model (light green line) for an explosion energy of 2 B and radius of 490 R(cid:12) is compared with both the data and simulation.
photospheric model to zero ﬂux predicts shock breakout
at t0 = 2455873.75 ± 0.05 BJD which corresponds to the
time of the largest deviation from the model.

When we subtract the best ﬁt photosphere model for
KSN2011d there remains seven Kepler photometric ob-
servations within ﬁve hours of t0 that are 3σ or more
above zero (lower panel in Fig. 4). To avoid bias that
might come from dividing the data into bins, we have
smoothed the light curve residuals using a Gaussian
with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 3 hours.
There is a clear 6σ peak at the time expected for breakout
and we conclude that this is, indeed, the shock breakout
from KSN2011d. The shock breakout ﬂux is 12% of the
peak ﬂux of the supernova, corresponding to a Kepler
magnitude of 22.3±0.2 after correcting for Milky Way
extinction.

In the Nakar & Sari (2010) shock breakout model, the
initial rise is the result of diﬀusion of the shock emis-
sion before the shock reaches the stellar surface and is
only of order ﬁve minutes. This is too short a time for
even the Kepler cadence, so the rise to shock breakout
is unresolved. After shock breakout the ﬂux decay fol-
lows a t−4/3 power-law in time until the expanding pho-
tosphere dominates the luminosity. This decay is rela-
tively slow and allows the breakout to remain detectable
for several hours. From the Nakar & Sari (2010) formu-
lation, we can estimate the ratio between the peak ﬂux
from the shock breakout, FSB, and the maximum photo-
spheric ﬂux, Fmax, which we approximate as the bright-
ness 10 days after explosion. Using the ratio between
the shock peak and photosphere maximum is particu-
larly useful since it eliminates the uncertainty caused by
distance and dust extinction. In the rest-frame optical
(5500˚A) the ﬂux ratio is

where M15 is the progenitor mass in units of 15 M(cid:12), R500
is the progenitor radius in units of 500 R(cid:12), and E51 is
the explosion energy in units of 1051 erg. So we expect
the shock breakout in a typical RSG to peak at about
25% of visual brightness of the supernova at maximum.
Applying the Nakar & Sari (2010) model to KSN2011d
(radius of 490 R(cid:12), energy of 2 B and a progenitor mass of
15 M(cid:12)), predicts a breakout temperature of 2×105 ◦K,
and equation 1 gives FSB/Fmax = 0.16, meaning the
shock should be 2 mag fainter in the optical than the
supernova at maximum. The Kepler 30 minute cadence
will smooth the sharp peak of the breakout and lower
the maximum by 20% so we expect the ratio to be
FSB/Fmax = 0.13. The excess ﬂux seen in Fig. 4 peaks
at a relative ﬂux of 0.12±0.2 and is consistent with the
Nakar & Sari (2010) prediction.

We use a blackbody spectrum to extrapolate the shock
breakout ﬂux down to the optical and this is likely a poor
approximation. So it is surprising that the semi-analytic
model of Nakar & Sari (2010) works so well in matching
the observed breakout. Tominaga et al. (2011) calcu-
lated realistic spectra at breakout for a variety of RSG
models. While color temperatures and integrated lumi-
nosities varied greatly, the peak optical ﬂux at break-
out was fairly consistent: between 2 × 1037 to 1×1038
erg s−1 ˚A−1, corresponding to absolute magnitudes be-
tween −14.2 and −15.9 mag. The Tominaga et al. (2011)
model for a 15 M(cid:12), 1 B and 500 R(cid:12) RSG predicts a peak
at MKp = −14.4 9 mag. Doubling the explosion energy
would brighten the breakout by about 0.2 mag, yield-
ing a luminosity of MKp = −14.6 mag. The observed
shock breakout from KSN2011d is MKp = −15.6 ± 0.3
mag (after correction for Milky Way extinction; assum-

excellent job in predicting the optical brightness of the
shock breakout in KSN2011d.

We have simulated the light curve of KSN2011d us-
ing the statistical properties of the Kepler photometry
based on 100 days prior to the supernova detection (right
panel in Fig. 4). The photospheric rise of the light curve
uses the Rabinak & Waxman (2011) model and the shock
breakout uses the Nakar & Sari (2010) model with our
best ﬁt parameters. Assuming Gaussian statistics, we
created a Monte Carlo simulation of the models sampled
at the Kepler cadence. The simulation matches the ob-
served light curve extremely well and we again conclude
that we have detected the shock breakout in KSN2011d.

4.2.3. Radiative Precursor?

In the 12 hours before shock breakout there are only
two of the 24 Kepler observations that fall below the
median pre-supernova ﬂux. That is, the light curve of
KSN2011d shows a possible slow rise in brightness start-
ing 0.5 days before breakout. This is intriguing as core-
collapse likely occurred nearly a day before shock break-
out (Chevalier & Irwin 2011). The shock travels more
slowly than photons diﬀuse through the RSG envelope,
allowing evidence for the shock to reach the surface be-
fore breakout. However, Nakar & Sari (2010) predicts
the shock energy would leak out through diﬀusion on a
time-scale of only ﬁve minutes for a RSG. In contrast
Schawinski et al. (2008) suggests a “radiative precursor”
due to photon diﬀusion could begin hours before shock
breakout and there is some evidence for a precursor seen
in the GALEX detection of a SNIIP ﬁve hours before the
peak breakout emission.

While it is tantalizing to claim precursor emission in
KSN2011d, the smoothed ﬂux remains at 3σ or less from
median value, so this detection is not deﬁnitive. More
observations of SNIIP with extremely fast cadence are
needed to determine the diﬀusion time-scale before shock
breakout.

5. CONCLUSION

We discovered two transient events in the Kepler ﬁeld
with light curves that strongly suggest they are SNIIP
events. From the fast cadence of the Kepler observations
we determine the time the supernova shock reached the
surface of the progenitor with a precision of better than
0.1 days. We ﬁnd the rise time to maximum was 10.5±0.4
rest-frame days for KSN2011a and 13.3±0.4 days for
KSN2011d. From the rise times combined with their
peak luminosities (not corrected for host extinction), we
estimate the progenitor radius of KSN2011a (280 R(cid:12)) to

be signiﬁcantly smaller than that for KSN2011d (490 R(cid:12))
but both have similar explosion energies of 2 B.

Our directly measured rise-times for both Kepler
events are many standard deviations larger than the me-
dian rise-time of SNIIP estimated from an ensemble of
light curves by Gonzalez-Gaitan et al. (2015). This dif-
ference results from the variation of rise-time with ef-
fective wavelength. Gonzalez-Gaitan et al. (2015) ref-
erenced their rise-time to the SDSS-g band while light
curves peak several days later in the redder Kepler band-
pass. The median radius of the progenitors estimated by
Gonzalez-Gaitan et al. (2015) is 320 R(cid:12) which is com-
parable to the radii we infer from the Kepler data. As
with the Gonzalez-Gaitan et al. (2015) estimates, radii
measured from SNIIP light curves tend to be at the low
end of the distribution of radii estimated for RSG di-
rectly observed in the Milky Way (Levesque et al. 2005).
Some of this discrepancy may be due to the idealized an-
alytic models failing to account for opacity changes near
maximum light (e.g. Rubin et al. 2015).

The rising light curve of KSN2011d is an excellent
match to that predicted by the Rabinak & Waxman
(2011) models for RSG. However, the Rabinak & Wax-
man (2011) models underestimate the brightness of
KSN2011a during the ﬁrst ﬁve days and we suggest that
the additional ﬂux is due to the supernova shock mov-
ing into a pre-existing wind or mass-loss from the RSG.
Moriya et al. (2011) has shown that a mass loss rate
of 10−4 M(cid:12) yr−1 will steepen the light curve while not
strongly impacting the ﬂux at maximum light or the
shape of the post-maximum light curve.

No fast shock breakout emission is seen in KSN2011a,
but this is likely due to the circumstellar interaction sus-
pected in the early light curve. KSN2011d does show
excess emission at the time expected for shock breakout
with a brightness of 12% that of supernova peak in the
Kepler band. The time-scale and brightness observed for
the breakout is consistent with model predictions.

The diversity in the rising light curves of SNIIP ob-
served by Kepler show that early observations are crit-
ical in understanding the progenitors and circumstellar
environments of exploding RSG stars.
