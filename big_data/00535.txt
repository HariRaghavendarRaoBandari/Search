From the Hamiltonian connecting the inside and outside of an Fabry-Pérot cavity, which is derived
from the Maxwell boundary conditions at a mirror of the cavity, a master equation of a non-Lindblad
form is derived when the cavity embeds matters, although we can transform it to the Lindblad
form by performing the rotating-wave approximation to the connecting Hamiltonian. We calculate
absorption spectra by these Lindblad and non-Lindblad master equations and also by the Maxwell
boundary conditions in the framework of the classical electrodynamics, which we consider the most
reliable approach. We found that, compared to the Lindblad master equation, the absorption spectra
by the non-Lindblad one agree better with those by the Maxwell boundary conditions. Although the
discrepancy is highlighted only in the ultra-strong light-matter interaction regime with a relatively
large broadening, the master equation of the non-Lindblad form is preferable rather than of the
Lindblad one for pursuing the consistency with the classical electrodynamics.

INTRODUCTION

Most of all realistic systems are not isolated, but
they are coupled with environments. This system-
environment coupling (SEC) is important for discussing
measurements, thermalization, dissipation, noise, etc. In
such open systems, we in principle require naive con-
sideration on the separation of systems of interest and
environments, mechanisms of the SECs, preparation of
environment, and so on [1, 2]. The quantum description
of the Brownian motion has long been discussed as an
important subject of this kind of study [3–9]. The so-
called Caldeira-Leggett master equation [3] is a quantum
counterpart of the Fokker-Planck equation of the Brow-
nian motion. However, this master equation is not of the
Lindblad form [10]. Then, the positivity of the density
operator is not guaranteed in general. Whereas we can
add extra terms to the Caldeira-Leggett master equation
for transforming it to the Lindblad form, the justiﬁca-
tion of these extra terms is unclear in classical physics
[8, 9]. In this way, for the quantum description of open
systems, we sometimes face a trade-oﬀ between the math-
ematical requirement (positivity of density operator) and
the physical one (consistency with the physical laws).

In this paper, we will show another example for this
kind of discussion: a high-quality Fabry-Pérot cavity em-
bedding matters with a damping of excitations. Such a
system has long been discussed in the study of quan-
tum optics or so-called cavity quantum electrodynamics
(cavity QED) [7, 11], and master equations of the Lind-
blad form have been used in most cases. However, we
will show that, from the Hamiltonian of the SEC derived
for the Fabry-Pérot cavity [12], master equations of a
non-Lindblad form are obtained in general. For trans-
forming it to the Lindblad form, we need to apply the

∗ E-mail: bamba@qi.mp.es.osaka-u.ac.jp

rotating-wave approximation (RWA) to the SEC Hamil-
tonian, which has been widely used in the study of quan-
tum optics (but implicitly in most cases). The inﬂuence
of the RWA to the SEC was discussed also in the study
of the quantum Brownian motion [6], while it was not
used in the early study of the quantum description of
dissipation [1].

We will calculate absorption spectra of the cavity sys-
tem by the Lindblad and non-Lindblad master equations,
and they will be compared with the results calculated by
the Maxwell boundary conditions (MBCs) at a mirror
of the cavity in the framework of the classical electrody-
namics, which is considered as the most reliable method
(direct consequence by the physical law) in this paper.
Although the quantum theory should reproduce the re-
sults in the classical theory, we sometimes face an incon-
sistency caused by approximations used in the quantum
theory (RWA to SEC in our case). We will ﬁnd that the
non-Lindblad master equation gives more consistent re-
sults with those by the MBCs. The discrepancy between
the results by the Lindblad master equation and by the
other two is highlighted in the ultra-strong light-matter
interaction regime [13] with a relatively rapid damping
of excitations in matters. The ultra-strong interaction
means that the interaction strength is comparable to or
larger than the transition frequency of matters, and it
has been realized experimentally in a variety of systems
[14–24]. While both the ultra-strong light-matter inter-
action and the rapid damping occur inside the cavity,
the non-Lindblad form concerning the cavity loss, which
is basically supposed much slower than them (good cav-
ity), will be discussed in this paper.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we ﬁrst
overview some Lindblad master equations derived in the
past for the cavity system and the non-Lindblad one to be
discussed in this paper. In Sec. III, quantum Langevin
equations that are basically equivalent to the Lindblad
and non-Lindblad master equations are shown. The ab-

sorption spectra are in fact calculated by these quantum
Langevin equations for simplifying the calculation.
In
Sec. IV, we show the models of the cavity and the medium
in the cavity. The Hamiltonians inside the cavity and the
SEC are also shown. In Sec. V, we explain the calcula-
tion methods by the MBCs and the quantum Langevin
equations. Typical absorption spectra are also shown in
ﬁgures. Sec. VI is devoted to the comparison of the three
approaches, and the summary is shown in Sec. VII. The
detailed derivation of the master and quantum Langevin
equations are shown in App. A. The master equations for
frequency-dependent loss rate are summarized in App. B.
The detailed calculation method by the Lindblad-type
quantum Langevin equations is shown in App. C. The
absorption spectra calculated by the Lindblad-type treat-
ment for the excitation damping are discussed in App. D.

II. NON-LINDBLAD FORM TO BE DISCUSSED

In most studies of cavity QED [7, 11], the SEC has been
introduced simply as the injection and escape of photons
from cavities in the framework of master equation, quan-
tum Langevin equation, stochastic diﬀerential equation,
or Fokker-Planck equation. This simple treatment has
well reproduced a variety of experimental results. The
SEC Hamiltonian is typically expressed as

SEC =Z ∞
ˆHphoton

0

dω ir κ

2π h ˆf †(ω)ˆa − ˆa† ˆf (ω)i .

(1)

Here, κ is a frequency-independent loss rate. ˆa is the
annihilation operator of a photon in a cavity mode. ˆf (ω)
is the annihilation operator of a photon with a frequency
ω outside the cavity, and it satisﬁes [ ˆf (ω), ˆf †(ω′)] = δ(ω−
ω′). The Hamiltonian of the environment is expressed as

env =Z ∞
ˆHsimple

0

dω ω ˆf †(ω) ˆf (ω).

(2)

For the vacuum environment h ˆf †(ω) ˆf (ω′)i = 0 (nearly at
zero temperature compared to the frequency scale of in-
terest) and in the Born-Markov approximation, the cav-
ity loss is described in the master equation as

κ

∂t

ˆρ = ˆL0[ˆρ] +

κ

2 (cid:0)(cid:2)ˆa, ˆρˆa†(cid:3) +(cid:2)ˆaˆρ, ˆa†(cid:3)(cid:1)
2 (cid:0)2ˆaˆρˆa† − ˆa†ˆaˆρ − ˆρˆa†ˆa(cid:1) .

Here, ˆρ is the density operator of system of interest (in-
side the cavity), and ˆL0[ˆρ] represents

(3)

(4)

ˆL0[ˆρ] =

1

ih ˆH0, ˆρi + ˆLothers[ˆρ],

where ˆH0 is the Hamiltonian of the system of interest
and ˆLothers[ˆρ] represents the dissipative terms originating
from couplings with the other environments.

2

While the master equation such as in Eq. (3) has a
simple form to be used very easily, it is in general not
appropriate for strongly coupled composite systems as
discussed in Refs. [25–29]. The system of our interest is
also such a composite system, i.e., photons and excita-
tions in matters. Instead of Eq. (3), the master equation
should be derived under specifying a (non-dimensional)
physical quantity ˆQ of the system of interest that medi-
ates the SEC. From the detail of the mechanism of SEC,
the SEC Hamiltonian is typically derived as [12]

SEC =Z ∞
ˆHsimple

0

dω ir κ

2π

ˆQh ˆf †(ω) − ˆf (ω)i .

(5)

Here, applying the RWA to this SEC Hamiltonian in the
basis of the eigen-states {|µi} of ˆH0, we get

SEC ≈Z ∞
ˆHsimple

0

dω ir κ

2π h ˆf †(ω) ˆQ↓ − ˆQ↑ ˆf (ω)i ,

(6)

where ˆQ↓ and ˆQ↑ are the lowering and raising compo-
nents of ˆQ, respectively, as

ˆQµ,ν,

ˆQ↓ ≡Xµ Xν>µ
ˆQ↑ ≡Xµ Xν>µ
ˆQµ,ν ≡ |µihµ| ˆQ|νihν| = { ˆQν,µ}†.

{ ˆQµ,ν}† = { ˆQ↓}†,

(7a)

(7b)

(8)

Note that, in this paper, operators mediating SECs are
supposed to have no diagonal matrix element hµ| ˆQ|µi = 0
in the basis of the eigen-states, whereas such a diagonal
element causes the pure dephasing in principle [11, 30].
From the approximated SEC Hamiltonian in Eq. (6), the
master equation is derived in the Born-Markov approxi-
mation as

∂
∂t

ˆρ = ˆL0[ˆρ] +
= ˆL0[ˆρ] +

κ

κ

2 (cid:16)h ˆQ↓, ˆρ ˆQ↑i +h ˆQ↓ ˆρ, ˆQ↑i(cid:17)
2 (cid:16)2 ˆQ↓ ˆρ ˆQ↑ − ˆQ↑ ˆQ↓ ˆρ − ˆρ ˆQ↑ ˆQ↓(cid:17) .

(9)

In contrast, if the interaction in the composite system
is weak enough compared with the loss rate κ (weak in-
teraction regime), the RWA to the SEC in the photon
basis can be justiﬁed, and the widely-used SEC Hamil-
tonian in Eq. (1) is derived by supposing ˆQ = ˆa + ˆa†
or ˆQ = i(ˆa − ˆa†). Then, the simple master equation in
Eq. (3) is derived in the Born-Markov approximation.
The master equation in Eq. (9) is not equivalent to
the simple one in Eq. (3) if the light-matter interaction
is in the ultra-strong regime [30]. For example, here we
tentatively suppose a simple Hamiltonian

ˆHsimple

0

= ωcˆa†ˆa + ˘g(ˆa + ˆa†)ˆσx + ˆHmat.

(10)

Here, ωc is the resonance frequency of a cavity mode.
ˆHmat is the Hamiltonian of matters inside the cavity, and

RWA to the SEC Hamiltonian but with diﬀerent bases, and they are of the Lindblad form. In contrast, Eq. (12) is derived
without the RWA, and it is of a non-Lindblad form. The validity of these master equations are summarized for the weak,
normally strong, and ultra-strong light-matter interaction regimes. They are valid basically for ω-independent loss rate κ. The
case of ω-dependent κ(ω) is discussed in App. B and summarized in Tab. II.

ˆσx = ˆσ + ˆσ† is a non-dimensional operator that annihi-
lates (ˆσ) or creates (ˆσ†) an excitation in matters. ˘g rep-
resents the strength of the light-matter interaction, and
the ultra-strong regime means ˘g & ωc, ωa, where ωa is
a characteristic transition frequency of the matter. Due
to the so-called counter-rotating terms ˆaˆσ and ˆa† ˆσ† in
ˆHsimple
, the annihilation of a photon ˆa no longer corre-
sponds to the lowering operator for the system inside the
cavity (ˆa 6= ˆQ↓) [13]. Then, in the ultra-strong interac-
tion regime, we must use the master equation in Eq. (9)
[30].
If we use the simple master equation in Eq. (3)
for the Hamiltonian with the counter-rotating terms in
Eq. (10), the system inside the cavity is in general excited
even by the vacuum environment [31]. The degree of the
excitation can no longer be negligible in the ultra-strong
interaction regime.

In contrast, in the normally strong interaction regime
(κ ≪ ˘g ≪ ωc, ωa), we can apply the RWA to the light-
matter interaction, and the counter-rotating terms are
eliminated as

ˆHsimple

0

≈ ωcˆa†ˆa + ˘g(ˆσ†ˆa + ˆa† ˆσ) + ˆHmat.

(11)

For this approximated Hamiltonian, the photon annihi-
lation corresponds to the lowering of the cavity system
(ˆa = ˆQ↓). Then, the master equation in Eq. (9) is in
fact reduced to the simple one in Eq. (3). In Tab. I, we
summarize the validity of the two master equations in
Eqs. (3) and (9).

Note that the simple master equation in Eq. (3) is valid
in the normally strong interaction regime only for the
ω-independent loss rate κ.
If the loss rate κ(ω) rela-
tively varies in the frequency range of interest, we need
to use the extended version of the master equation in
Eq. (9) applicable to the ω-dependent κ(ω) (see the de-
tail in App. B). Such a master equation can no longer
be reduced to the simple one as in Eq. (3). Further,
the extended master equation is of a non-Lindblad form,
while both Eqs. (3) and (9) for ω-independent κ are of
the Lindblad form.
In this way, when we consider the
ω-dependent loss rate κ(ω), we have faced the problem
of the Lindblad form (positivity of density operator) in
the study of cavity QED even in the weak and normally
strong interaction regimes. The detail is discussed in
App. B.

However, the non-Lindblad form caused by the ω-
dependent κ(ω) is not the target in this paper. We will
argue that the following non-Lindblad master equation
should be used even for the ω-independent κ:

∂
∂t

ˆρ = ˆL0[ˆρ] +

κ

2 (cid:16)h ˆQ, ˆρ ˆQ↑i +h ˆQ↓ ˆρ, ˆQi(cid:17) .

(12)

This is derived also in the Born-Markov approxima-
tion. But,
in contrast to Eq. (9), this is derived di-
rectly from the SEC Hamiltonian in Eq. (5) without the
RWA performed in Eq. (6) (the detailed derivation is
shown in App. A). For discussing the necessity of this
non-Lindblad form in Eq. (12), we will basically sup-
pose ω-independent κ in the following sections. Whereas
the Lindblad master equation in Eq. (9) was recognized
to be applicable basically in the ultra-strong interaction
regime, we will show that the absorption spectra by it
in general deviate from those by the MBCs, which are
supposed to be the most reliable approach in this paper.
We get larger deviation for stronger light-matter interac-
tion and wider broadening (this is the reason of ∗Good
in Tab. I). We will show that the non-Lindblad master
equation in Eq. (12) gives more consistent results with
those by the MBCs than the Lindblad one in Eq. (9).

Note that, by extending the master equations in
Eqs. (9) and (12) for the environments at a non-zero tem-
perature T , we obtain the thermal state ρ = e− ˆH0/kBT
as a steady state of such extended master equations of
both the Lindblad and non-Lindblad forms. The detail
is discussed in App. B.

Note also that we basically neglect the energy shift
(Lamb shift) due to the SEC both in the Lindblad and
non-Lindblad master equations. While the energy shift is
implicitly included in the calculation of absorption spec-
tra by the MBCs, it will not clearly appear in the broad
absorption peaks in our numerical calculations.

III. MASTER AND LANGEVIN EQUATIONS

Whereas we aim to discuss the validity of the Lindblad
and non-Lindblad master equations as shown in Eqs. (9)
and (12), we will in fact calculate absorption spectra by
quantum Langevin equations corresponding to those two

master equations for pursuing simple and clear calcula-
tions. In this section, we preliminarily shows this corre-
spondence.

We will consider the SEC Hamiltonian expressed as

SEC =Z ∞
ˆHcav

ˆQjh ˆf †

c (ω) − ˆfc(ω)i .

(13)

Basically, all the modes indexed by j in a Fabry-Pérot
cavity are considered, and

ˆQj = ˆaj + ˆa†
j

(14)

is a coordinate of the j-th mode. ˆaj is the annihilation
operator of a photon, and κj is the loss rate of this mode.
All the cavity modes couple with the same environment
described by ˆfc(ω), whose correlation is supposed as

derived (detail is shown also in App. A), respectively, as

From the SEC Hamiltonians in Eqs. (13) and (17), the

The quantum Langevin equation in Eq. (19a) corre-
sponds to the non-Lindblad master equation in Eq. (18a),
because they are derived from the same SEC Hamilto-
nian in Eq. (13). On the other hand, (19b) corresponds
to the Lindblad one in Eq. (18b), which are derived from
Eq. (17). For checking the correspondence, let us derive
equations of motion of expectation values. The equations
of motion of h ˆS(t)i are derived from the master equations

in Eqs. (18a) and Eq. (18b), respectively, as

(27)
Even in the presence of the SEC, this equivalence is ap-
proximately guaranteed, if the line broadening does not
elongate around ω = 0. We basically suppose such a
situation in the main text of this paper, and the dissi-
pative terms approximately equal between Eq. (24a) and
Eq. (25a) and between Eq. (24b) and Eq. (25b). In fact,
what is more important is the commutators: [ ˆS, ˆQj] for
the non-Lindblad form and [ ˆS, ˆQ↑
j ] for the Lindblad form.
In this way, the quantum Langevin equations in Eq. (19a)
and (19b) correspond to the non-Lindblad master equa-
tion in Eq. (18a) and the Lindblad one in Eq. (18b), re-
spectively. We will calculate absorption spectra by these
quantum Langevin equations.

IV. MODEL AND HAMILTONIAN

In order to evaluate the validity of the Lindblad
and non-Lindblad master equations shown in the previ-

FIG. 1. The Fabry-Pérot cavity considered in this paper.
A perfect and imperfect mirrors are placed at z = ℓ and 0,
respectively. The inside of the cavity is ﬁlled by a medium
with a dielectric function εp(ω).

ous sections, we consider a Fabry-Pérot cavity embed-
ding a dispersive and absorptive medium depicted in
Fig. 1. We will compare absorption spectra calculated
by these master equations (quantum Langevin equations
exactly speaking) and by the MBCs, which are shown in
Sec. IV A. Perfect and imperfect mirrors are placed at
z = ℓ and 0, respectively. Supposing the spatially depen-
dent dielectric function ε(z, ω) of this cavity structure, we
derive a SEC Hamiltonian connecting inside and outside
the cavity in Sec. IV B. The Hamiltonian describing the
cavity modes and the dispersive and absorptive medium
is shown in Sec. IV D. From these Hamiltonians, we will
calculate absorption spectra by the Lindblad- and non-
Lindblad-type quantum Langevin equations in Sec. VI.
On the other hand, in Sec. IV C, from the Hamiltonian
inside the cavity, we calculate a dielectric function εp(ω)
(dispersion relation) of the electromagnetic wave in the
medium. From this dielectric function and that of the
mirrors, we will also calculate absorption spectra by the
MBCs in Secs. V and VI. We will compare these three
absorption spectra for evaluating the validity of the Lind-
blad and non-Lindblad master equations in Sec. VI. In
the following sub-sections, we explain the model of the
cavity system and the Hamiltonian describing it.

A. Maxwell boundary conditions

In the same manner as in Refs. [12, 33, 34], we describe
the imperfect mirror by the Kronecker’s delta function
with a coeﬃcient η(ω), and the dielectric function of the
system is expressed as

ε(z, ω) = η(ω)δ(z) +


z < 0

0
εp(ω) 0 < z < ℓ
∞

ℓ < z

(28)

The Maxwell boundary conditions at z = 0 are derived
for the electric ﬁeld E(z, ω) and the magnetic one H(z, ω)

6

as [12, 34]

E(0−, ω) = E(0+, ω),

H(0−, ω) − H(0+, ω) = −iωε0η(ω)E(0, ω).

(29a)

(29b)

These are independent of the detail of εp(ω), i.e., the
detail inside the cavity. Further, at z = ℓ, the electric
ﬁeld satisﬁes

E(ℓ, ω) = 0.

(30)

The electric and magnetic ﬁelds are expressed by the vec-
tor potential A(z, ω) as

where the loss rate κj(ω) for empty cavity is expressed
as

κj(ω) =

2c2kj
ωℓΛ(ω)2 .

(37)

From the MBCs in Eqs. (29), the reﬂectance of the im-
perfect mirror is obtained as

Rmirror(ω) =

1

1 + 4/Λ(ω)2 .

(38)

E(z, ω) = iωA(z, ω),

Since the round trip time of light inside the cavity is 2ℓ/c,
the loss rate κj (decay rate of light intensity) of the j-th
mode is estimated as

B. Hamiltonian of system-environment coupling

From the above Maxwell boundary conditions,

in
Ref. [12], we derived the Hamiltonian connecting inside
and outside the cavity, which is independent of the de-
tail inside the cavity but is valid only for good cavities.
In the absence of the SEC (in the case of perfect cav-
ity) and of the light-matter interaction, the Hamiltonian
of the electromagnetic ﬁelds inside the cavity is simply
expressed as

ˆHcav =Xj

ckj ˆa†

j ˆaj,

(32)

where ˆaj annihilates a photon in the j-th mode satisfying
[ˆaj, ˆa†

j ′ ] = δj,j ′ and

j = 1, 2, 3, . . .

is the conﬁnement wavenumber. The operators of the
vector potential and magnetic ﬁeld inside the cavity are
expressed as

Introducing a non-dimensional quantity

Λ(ω) = η(ω)ω/c

(35)
(Λ ≫ 1 corresponds to good cavity), the SEC Hamil-
tonian is described by the magnetic ﬁeld ˆH(0+) at the
imperfect mirror z = 0 as [12]

(39)

In the good cavity limit Λ(ω) ≫ 1, κj(ωj) in Eq. (37) is
certainly equal to Kj.
Since we will consider basically the ω-independent κ,

we suppose η(ω) ∝ ω−3/2 and

Λ(ω) = Λ0r ωa

(40)

Here, Λ0 is independent of ω, and we will basically sup-
pose Λ0 = 103 ≫ 1 in the numerical calculation.

C. Dielectric function of medium

As the model of the dispersive and absorptive medium
inside the cavity, we consider a bosonic excitation with a
transition frequency ωa, transition dipole moment d, den-
sity D of excitonic sites, and inﬁnite translational mass
of excitation. Here, we ﬁrst consider a spatially inﬁnite
medium, and derive its dielectric function εp(ω). As dis-
cussed, for example, in Refs. [35, 36], when we restrict the
light propagation in the z direction, the Hamiltonian of
such a medium can be described in the velocity or length
form (sometimes called the Coulomb and electric dipole
gauges while both are in the Coulomb gauge in the sense
of ∇ · A = 0) equivalently as

nations are commutable. The capital operators are Her-

(45)

Since we will calculate the absorption (reﬂection) spec-
tra of the cavity system for evaluating the validity of the
Lindblad and non-Lindblad master equations, we con-
sider also a damping of excitations in matters. Other-
wise, the absorption is never observed. For keeping the
equivalence between the velocity and length forms, we
consider that the damping is mediated by { ˆXk}, which
is commutable with the unitary operator ˆU in Eq. (44).
The environment for the damping is introduced for each
excitation mode independently, and the Hamiltonian of
the environment and the SEC for the damping is de-
scribed as

the dielectric function εp(ω) of this damping medium
(dispersive and absorptive medium), in the same man-

Langevin equation corresponding to the non-Lindblad
master equation:

where ˆbin
k is the input operator due to the damping. The
discussion for Lindblad-type damping is performed in
App. D. Since there is no loss of photons in the inﬁnite
medium, the quantum Langevin equations are derived in
the velocity form as
−iω ˆQk(ω) = −c|k| ˆΠk(ω),
−iω ˆΠk(ω) = (c|k| + 4¯gk

On the other hand, in the length form, we get

−iω ˆΠk(ω) = c|k| ˆQk(ω),

From this dielectric function εp(ω), the spatial depen-
dence of ε(z, ω) in Eq. (28), and by the MBCs, we can
calculate the absorption and reﬂection spectra of the cav-
ity embedding the dispersive and absorptive medium.

D. Hamiltonian inside the cavity

(46)

Whereas the spatially inﬁnite system is considered for
deriving the dielectric function εp(ω) of the medium in
the previous sub-section, here we show the Hamiltonian
inside the cavity. Since the bosonic excitations have an
inﬁnite mass, we have a freedom of choosing the ba-
sis for describing the eigen-modes of them. We expand
the excitations by the same wavefunctions as the pho-
ton modes in perfect cavity, i.e., characterized by the
conﬁnement wavenumber kj in Eq. (33), while the tran-
sition frequency is ωa for all the excitation modes. In the

similar manner as the Hamiltonian ˆHcav for the empty
cavity in Eq. (32), the Hamiltonian inside the ﬁlled cavity
is described as

erator of an excitation with kj. The capital operators
are deﬁned as similar as in Eqs. (42). The light-matter
interaction strengths ¯g and ˜g are expressed by the non-
dimensional strength g deﬁned in Eq. (43) as

¯gj = gωar ωa

In the numerical calculation of the absorption spectra
by the Lindblad-type quantum Langevin equation, we
need the lowering and raising components of the opera-
tors ˆQj, ˆXj, . . . Since the system of interest in this pa-
per has no unharmonicity, we can easily diagonalize the
Hamiltonian ˆHv/r
in Eqs. (52) by the Bogoliubov trans-
formation [13, 37]. Since the conﬁnement wavenumber
kj is a good quantum number, the system can be diag-
onalized for each kj by the polariton operator expressed
as

0

ˆpj,ζ = wj,ζ ˆaj + xj,ζˆbj + yj,ζ ˆa†

j + zj,ζˆb†

(55)

For each kj, there are lower mode (ζ = L) and upper one
(ζ = U ). The coeﬃcients {wj,ζ , xj,ζ, yj,ζ, zj,ζ} and the
eigen-frequencies {ωj,ζ} are determined for satisfying

and the normalization condition

j ′,ζ ′i = δj,j ′ δζ,ζ ′.

For the velocity form, the detailed analytical expressions
are shown in Ref. [34, 37]. For the velocity and length
forms, we get the same eigen-frequencies {ωj,ζ}, while
the coeﬃcients {wj,ζ , xj,ζ, yj,ζ, zj,ζ} are diﬀerent. In the

calculations in this paper, we checked numerically that
the two forms certainly give the same results. Since the
annihilation operators are expressed as

V. CALCULATIONS BY THREE APPROACHES

In order to evaluate the validity of the Lindblad and
non-Lindblad master equations, we compare the absorp-
tion spectra calculated by them (exactly speaking, by
corresponding quantum Langevin equations) and that by
the MBCs along the classical electrodynamics. The com-
parison and discussion will be performed in Sec. VI. In
this section, we show the calculation methods of the three
approaches: by the MBCs in Sec. V A, non-Lindblad-type
equation in Sec. V B, and Lindblad-type one in Sec. V C.

A. Absorption by Maxwell boundary conditions

From the spatially dependent dielectric function ε(z, ω)
in Eq. (28) and εp(ω) of the medium in Eq. (51), we
can calculate the reﬂection and absorption spectra of the
cavity system. The electric ﬁeld in the whole system is
expressed as

E(z, ω) =(E0(ω)ei(ω/c)z + Er(ω)e−i(ω/c)z

E1(ω) sin[kp(ω)(ℓ − z)]

z < 0
0 < z < ℓ

(60)
Here, E0(ω), Er(ω), and E1(ω) are the electric ﬁeld of
the incident wave, of reﬂected wave, and inside the cavity,
respectively. This expression satisﬁes the MBC at z = ℓ
as E(ℓ, ω) = 0. The complex wavenumber kp(ω) inside
the cavity is deﬁned with the refractive index np(ω) =

pεp(ω) as

kp(ω) = np(ω)ω/c.

(61)

From the MBCs at z = 0 in Eqs. (29), we get

E0(ω) + Er(ω) = E1(ω) sin[kp(ω)ℓ],
E0(ω) − Er(ω) = i{np(ω) cos[kp(ω)ℓ]

− Λ(ω) sin[kp(ω)ℓ]}E1(ω).

(62a)

(62b)

Then, the reﬂection coeﬃcient r(ω) = Er(ω)/E0(ω) is
obtained as

r(ω) =

[1 + iΛ(ω)] sin[kp(ω)ℓ] − inp(ω) cos[kp(ω)ℓ]
[1 − iΛ(ω)] sin[kp(ω)ℓ] + inp(ω) cos[kp(ω)ℓ]

.

(63)
The reﬂectance and absorption are calculated as R(ω) =
|r(ω)|2 and 1 − R(ω), respectively.

FIG. 2.
Absorption 1 − R(ω) calculated by the MBCs is
plotted as a function of ω/ωa. The light-matter interaction
strength is changed as g = 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 1.0. Parameters:
ℓ = πc/ωa, γ = 0.1ωa, and Λ0 = 103.

In Fig. 2, we plot the absorption spectra 1 − R(ω)
calculated by the MBCs with changing the light-matter
interaction strength g = 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 1.0. The
cavity length is supposed as a half of the light wave-
length at ωa in vacuum: ℓ = πc/ωa. Then, the res-
onance frequency of the lowest cavity mode (j = 1)
is ck1 = ωa. We supposed that the damping rate is
γ = 0.1ωa and the cavity loss is Λ0 = 103, which cor-
responds to κj = j × 6.366 × 10−7ωa for the j-th cavity
mode, and the quality factor is Q = ckj/κj = 1.571× 106
for the empty cavity. We basically suppose such a good
cavity, because the SEC Hamiltonian in Eq. (36) is valid
only for good cavities. For bad cavities, while the ab-
sorption spectra can be calculated by the MBCs for given
η(ω) or Λ(ω), the master and quantum Langevin equa-
tions cannot well reproduce them due to the invalidity of
the SEC Hamiltonian.

Since the damping rate is γ = 0.1ωa, g = 0.01 corre-
sponds to the weak interaction regime, and the absorp-
tion peaks are found at ω = ckj on the uppermost spec-
trum in Fig. 2. For larger g, we can ﬁnd the peak splitting

9

of the lowest (ﬁrst) cavity mode and the excitations as
the lower and upper polariton modes. In the ultra-strong
interaction regime g ∼ 1, the center of these two peaks
is shifted to the higher frequency side, and the lower po-
lariton frequency never becomes a negative or imaginary
value. Further, the peaks of the second (third) lower po-
lariton mode with k2 (k3) gradually appears, because the
photonic component of these lower polariton modes are
increased (excited more eﬃciently) by the increase in g.
For the present parameters, the lower polariton modes
with j > 3 appears as a broad and asymmetric peak
around ω ∼ ωa.

Λ0 = 103.

In Fig. 3, we ﬁxed the light-matter interaction strength
as g = 1, but the damping rate γ is changed from 0.1ωa to
0.5ωa. Increasing γ, the absorption peaks become broad-
ened. For γ = 0.5ωa, we cannot clearly ﬁnd the second
and the third lower polariton modes.

In the following discussion, we will use the undermost
absorption spectrum in Fig. 3 as a standard reference for
evaluating the validity of the Lindblad and non-Lindblad
master equations. This is because the discrepancy be-
tween them are highlighted for large g and γ as will be
found in Sec. VI.

For the total Hamiltonian ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆHcav

to the non-Lindblad master equation is obtained as

The equations of motion of the positive-frequency com-

velocity form as (ω > 0)

−iω ˆYj(ω) = (ωa − iγ) ˆXj(ω) − i2√γˆbin

j (ω).

The wavenumber kj is no longer a good quantum number
due to the coupling between inside and outside the cavity.
This equation set can be solved numerically, and we can
get the expression of ˆQj(ω) such as

ˆQj(ω) = αj(ω)ˆain(ω) +Xj ′

βj,j ′ (ω)ˆbin

j ′ (ω),

(66)

where the coeﬃcients αj(ω) and βj,j ′ (ω) are determined
numerically. Since the input-output relation is written
as in Eq. (23a), the output operator is represented as

ˆaout(ω) = r(ω)ˆain(ω) +Xj,j ′

where the reﬂection coeﬃcient is expressed as

√κjαj(ω).

(68)

The reﬂection is calculated as Rnon-Lindblad(ω) = |r(ω)|2,
and the absorption is 1 − Rnon-Lindblad(ω). We checked
numerically that the same results are obtained even in
the length form.

The total Hamiltonian is written as ˆH = ˆH0 +
ˆHcav-RWA
SEC-env. In the quantum Langevin
equation, the cavity loss is introduced corresponding

is treated in the non-Lindblad form. The quantum
Langevin equation is expressed in this case (under the
RWA to the cavity loss) as

The commutator [ ˆS, ˆQ↑

with {ˆp†

spectra in the similar manner as in the previous sub-
section, while the detailed equations are shown in App. C.

j

In this calculation, we replaced the Fourier trans-
j ′ (ω) by the positive-

form of the lowering component ˆQ↓

frequency component ˆQj ′ (ω) for ω > 0. We checked nu-
merically the validity of this replacement in the case that
both the cavity loss and damping is treated in the Lind-
blad form. This is because we can easily calculate the
absorption spectra by replacing all the positive-frequency
components of Hermitian operators with the Fourier
transform of the lowering components, e.g., ˆQj(ω) is re-
placed by ˆQ↓
j (ω), and polariton annihilation operators

{ˆpj,ζ} and creation ones {ˆp†
j,ζ} are not mixed in the equa-
tions of motion. We checked numerically that the ab-
sorption spectra by these approaches are approximately
equivalent. The detail of this discussion is shown in
App. C.

VI. COMPARISON OF THREE APPROACHES

In Fig. 4(a), we plot the absorption spectra by the
three approaches: the MBCs (solid line), non-Lindblad-
type quantum Langevin equation (dashed line), and
Lindblad-type one (dash-dotted line). The parameters
are the same as the undermost spectrum in Fig. 3:
ℓ = πc/ωa, Λ0 = 103, g = 1, and γ = 0.5ωa.
In the
calculations by the quantum Langevin equations, we con-
sidered the wavenumbers {kj} up to j = 2000.
We can clearly ﬁnd that the spectra by the MBCs and
non-Lindblad-type equation agree well with each other.
A small discrepancy is found at the top of the broad peak
around ω = ωa. This broad peak appears as the sum
of the peaks of lower polariton modes for 2 < j < ∞.
The small discrepancy basically comes from our neglect
of higher modes for j > 2000 in the calculation based on
the non-Lindblad-type quantum Langevin equation.

On the other hand, the spectrum by the Lindblad-type
equation clearly shows a discrepancy with that by the
other two approaches. Basically, a larger absorption is
obtained for ω < ωa, and smaller is obtained for ω > ωa
in the frequency range of the ﬁgure. It is hard to explain
this discrepancy in terms of physics, but, mathemati-
cally, it comes from the diﬀerence between the commuta-
tor [ ˆS, ˆQj] at the dissipation and noise terms concerning
the cavity loss in the non-Lindblad-type equation (64)
and [ ˆS, ˆQ↓
j ] in the Lindblad-type equation (69). This dif-
ference originates from the RWA to the SEC.

In order to catch the tendency of this discrepancy, in
Fig. 4(b), we decreased the damping rate as γ = 0.25ωa
while keeping the other parameters g, Λ0, and ℓ. All
the absorption peaks become narrower than those in
Fig. 4(a), and we can now ﬁnd the peak originating from
the second lower polariton mode. The discrepancy be-
tween the spectra by the Lindblad-type equation and the
other two is reduced than Fig. 4(a), although we did not
change the cavity-loss parameter Λ0 and the RWA was
performed to the SEC concerning the cavity loss.

On the other hand, in Fig. 4(c), we instead decreased
the light-matter interaction strength as g = 0.5 than in
Fig. 4(a) while keeping γ, Λ0, and ℓ. The discrepancy be-
comes relatively smaller than Fig. 4(a) especially around
the top of the peaks and the tail of the lowest peak, while
we can still ﬁnd the discrepancy around ω ∼ ωa.
In order to understand these tendencies of the dis-
crepancy, we tentatively simplify the calculation,
i.e.,
let us consider only the lowest wavenumber k1 for pho-
tons and excitations in the Lindblad and non-Lindblad
quantum Langevin equations. Since we cannot eliminate
the higher kj modes in the calculation by the MBCs,

11

we compare the absorption spectra by the two quantum
Langevin equations.

In Fig. 5(a), we plot the absorption spectra obtained by
the non-Lindblad-type quantum Langevin equation for
g = 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 with keeping γ = 0.5ωa, Λ0 = 103,
and ℓ = πc/ωa. The broad peak around ω ∼ ωa disap-
pears, and we simply get the peaks of the lower and upper
polariton modes with k1. In Fig. 5(b), we plot the ab-
sorption spectra in the case of γ = 0.25ωa. We can ﬁnd
narrower peaks than in Fig. 5(a). Concerning the dis-
crepancy between the Lindblad- and non-Lindblad-type
equations, we plot the normalized absorption diﬀerence
(RLindblad− Rnon-Lindblad)/(1− Rnon-Lindblad) for g = 1.0,
0.5, and 0.25 in Fig. 5(c). Surprisingly, these curves are
independent of γ and Λ0, but they depend on only g and
ℓ. We get positive values between the lower and upper
polariton frequencies, and negative values are obtained
out of this frequency region. Especially, the normalized
diﬀerence diverges for ω → 0. This is because the origi-
nal lowering components such as ˆQ↓
j and the raising ones
ˆQ↑
j are mixed through the SEC for ω ≪ ωa, because the
frequency diﬀerence 2ω of them becomes negligible than
the light-matter interaction strength gωa. However, since
the absorption peaks drop well to zero for ω → 0, we do
not focus on this divergence.
Since the normalized diﬀerence is zero at the lower and
upper polariton frequencies, we got the smaller discrep-
ancy in Fig. 4(b) by the decrease in the broadening γ.
The discrepancy is basically highlighted for large γ espe-
cially when γ is comparable to or larger than the mode
splitting ∼ 2gωa in this case. On the other hand, in
Fig. 5(c), the top of the curves at ω = ωa are 0.1464,
0.0528, and 0.0149 for g = 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25, respectively.
Thanks to this reduction of the discrepancy with the de-
crease in g, we get the smaller discrepancy at the top
and the lower tail of the lower polariton peak in Fig. 4(c)
than in Fig. 4(a). For understanding the remaining dis-
crepancy around ω = ωa in Fig. 4(c), we need to consider
also the higher kj modes for j > 1. We calculated the
absorption spectra by the Lindblad- and non-Lindblad-
type quantum Langevin equations with eliminating the
mixing of diﬀerent kj , i.e, the summation over j′ is per-
formed only for j′ = j in Eqs. (64) and (69). Although
we do not show the numerical results in ﬁgures, we got
almost the same absorption spectra as in Fig. 4, which
was calculated with the kj mixing. This minor contribu-
tion of the kj mixing is natural because we supposed the
good cavity with Λ0 ≫ 1. Then, we can say that the dis-
crepancy in Fig. 4 basically comes from the summation
of the diﬀerences seen in Fig. 5(c) for all the kj modes.
Concerning this discrepancy in Fig. 4(c), whereas the
k1 modes is a part of its origin, the higher kj modes
also contribute to it. From these facts, we can say that
the discrepancy between the Lindblad-type equation and
the other two methods clearly appear in the ultra-strong
light-matter interaction regime [as seen in Fig. 5(c)] with
a concentration of modes (overlap of absorption peaks),
which is increased by enlarging γ, i.e., wider broadening.

FIG. 4. Absorption spectra by three approaches: by the

g = 1.0 and γ = 0.25ωa, and (c) g = 0.5 and γ = 0.5ωa.
We basically get good agreement between the spectra by the
MBCs and by the non-Lindblad-type equation, while those
by the Lindblad-type equation show a discrepancy. The
discrepancy is basically reduced by the decrease in g and γ.
Parameters: ℓ = πc/ωa and Λ0 = 103. kj up to j = 2000
are considered.

(a,b) Absorption spectra calculated by the non-
FIG. 5.
Lindblad-type equation by considering only the lowest
wavenumber k1 are plotted for g = 1.0 (red solid line),
g = 0.5 (green dashed line), and g = 0.25 (blue dash-dotted
line). We supposed (a) γ = 0.5ωa and (b) γ = 0.25ωa. (c)
The diﬀerences of absorption spectra by the Lindblad- and
non-Lindblad-type equations normalized to that of the non-
Lindblad-type one are plotted as functions of ω/ωa. These
curves depend only on ℓ and g. Parameters: ℓ = πc/ωa and
Λ0 = 103.

Anyway, whereas we considered only the good cavity
case (Λ0 ≫ 1), we basically found a good agreement be-
tween the absorption spectra by the MBCs and the non-
Lindblad-type quantum Langevin equation. The absorp-
tion spectrum by the Lindblad-type equation shows a
discrepancy from them in the ultra-strong light-matter
interaction regime with a large broadening γ (overlap).

If the cavity quality is not so good as Λ0 . 1, we can-
not reproduce the absorption spectrum of the MBCs even
by the non-Lindblad-type quantum Langevin equation.
This is because our SEC Hamiltonian for the cavity loss
is valid only for the good cavities. On the other hand, for
much low damping γ ≪ ωa, the peak widths are found
to be almost the same for the three approaches. How-
ever, since we did not consider the Lamb shift due to the
SEC, the Lindblad and non-Lindblad master equations
give almost the same absorption spectra, while the peak
positions are found to be shifted in the spectra by the

MBCs.

From these facts, we conclude that we should not ap-
ply the RWA to the SEC of the cavity loss in the deriva-
tion of the master and quantum Langevin equations. Al-
though the master equation of the non-Lindblad form is
derived, it shows a better agreement with calculations
by the MBCs in the classical electrodynamics, compar-
ing to the Lindblad master equation derived under the
RWA to the SEC. Although we did not discuss in detail
the other SECs, such as the damping, the same conclu-
sion is probably obtained by considering explicitly the
mechanism of the SECs, because the RWA is an approx-
imation basically for the mathematical requirement, i.e.,
the positivity of density operator in the Lindblad master
equation.

VII. SUMMARY

13

From the MBCs at an imperfect mirror of a Fabry-
Pérot cavity, we derived a Hamiltonian connecting inside
and outside the cavity (SEC Hamiltonian) in the good-
cavity case [12]. From this Hamiltonian, in the Born-
Markov approximation but without the RWA to the SEC
Hamiltonian, the master equation of a non-Lindblad form
is derived even for frequency-independent loss rates κj of
the cavity modes. Then, the positivity of the density
operator is not guaranteed. For transforming it to the
Lindblad form, we need to apply the RWA to the SEC
Hamiltonian. However, we found that the absorption
spectra by the non-Lindblad master equation agree well
with those by the reliable calculation by the MBCs, while
the Lindblad master equation shows a discrepancy from
them in the ultra-strong light-matter interaction regime
with a large broadening (high damping rate γ). In this
way, in the similar manner as in the studies of quan-
tum Brownian motion [3–9], for the consistency with the
physical laws (Maxwell equations or MBCs), we some-
times need to consider a non-Lindblad master equation
derived without the RWA to the SEC, while the math-
ematical requirement (positivity of density operator) is
not guaranteed.

equation. Whereas this SEC Hamiltonian has the same
form as supposed in Sec. III, here we consider the ω-
dependent loss rate κ(ω) and a more general correlation
of the environment as

h ˆf †(ω) ˆf (ω′)i = n(ω)δ(ω − ω′),
h ˆf (ω) ˆf †(ω′)i = [n(ω) + 1]δ(ω − ω′),

(A11)

This is means that the environment is modiﬁed only
slightly and remains approximately in the initial state ˜ρB

which is justiﬁed when the environment is huge enough
and the SEC is relatively weak. Under the Born approx-
imation, the integrand in Eq. (A10) is rewritten as

For ω-independent κ and n(ω) = 0, this master equation is reduced to the non-Lindblad master equation in Eq. (18a).
Further, when the system of interest couples with the environment only through an operator ˆQ, it is reduced to
Eq. (12). When n(ω) 6= 0 and the system of interest couples with the environment only through an operator ˆQ, the
above master equation is reduced to Eq. (B6) for ω-dependent κ(ω) and to Eq. (B3) for ω-independent κ. On the

For ω-independent κ and n(ω) = 0, this master equation
is reduced to the Lindblad master equation in Eq. (18b).
Further, when the system of interest couples with the
environment only through an operator ˆQ, it is reduced
to Eq. (9). When n(ω) 6= 0 and the system of interest
couples with the environment only through an operator
ˆQ, the above master equation is reduced to Eq. (B4) for
ω-dependent κ(ω) and to Eq. (B2) for ω-independent κ.

Replacing ˆQ↓

Ref. [7].

Appendix B: Non-Lindblad master equations for

ω-dependent κ(ω)

Whereas we basically supposed the zero-temperature
environment in the main text, we can in general consider
that the environment has a population distribution as
h ˆf †(ω) ˆf (ω′)i = δ(ω − ω′)n(ω). For ω-independent κ and
n in the frequency range of interest, the master equations
in Eqs. (3), (9), and (12) are rewritten, respectively, as

The validity of these master equations is re-summarized
in Tab. II.

When the cavity loss κ(ω) and distribution n(ω) de-
pends on the frequency ω in the frequency range of inter-
est, the above three master equations are not appropriate
in general. However, if the frequency range of interest
is only around the cavity resonance ωc and κ(ω) is not
strongly varied in it, i.e., in the weak light-matter in-
teraction regime, the above three master equations are
basically valid. In this sense, in Tab. II, we denote that
they are Good in the weak interaction regime even for
ω-dependent κ(ω) or n(ω).

In the normally strong or ultra-strong light-matter in-
teraction regime for ω-dependent κ(ω) or n(ω), as de-
rived in App. A, the master equations are never expressed
with the photon operator ˆa as in Eq. (B1), but they are
represented as similar as the two master equations in
Eqs. (B2) and (B3). Instead of Eq. (B2) derived under
the RWA to the SEC Hamiltonian, the master equation
for ω-dependent κ(ω) and n(ω) is obtained in the Born-
Markov approximation (we obey Ref. [9] concerning the
meaning of the Markov approximation as performed in

(B4)

Whereas, under the RWA to the light-matter interaction,
ˆQ↓ and ˆQ↑ are reduced to ˆa and ˆa†, respectively, we can-
not rewrite the summation of κ(ων,µ) ˆQµ,ν [×n(ων,µ)] and
its Hermite conjugate simply by the photon annihilation
or creation operators. In this way, for the ω-dependent
κ(ω) or n(ω), we need to use the master equation in
Eq. (B4) even in the normally strong light-matter inter-
action regime, instead of Eq. (B1) or Eq. (B2).

Note that, while the two master equations (B1) and
(B2) are of the Lindblad form, Eq. (B4) is of a non-
Lindblad form.
In order to transform it to the Lind-
blad form, we sometimes neglect rapidly oscillating terms
(called the post-trace RWA in Ref. [29] and the RWA
in Eqs. (6) and (1) are called the pre-trace RWA), and
Eq. (B4) is approximated as

(B5)

This is certainly of the Lindblad form. However, this
approximation is valid only when the transitions be-
tween the eigen-states are well identiﬁed under strong
enough light-matter interaction. Then, the master equa-
tion in Eq. (B5) is not appropriate in the weak interac-
tion regime (we note this fact in Tab. II). In such case,
we should rather use the simple Lindblad master equa-
tion in Eq. (B1) or the non-Lindblad master equation
in Eq. (B4).
In this way, we have faced the problem
of the Lindblad form (positivity of density operator) in

the study of cavity QED even in the weak and normally
strong interaction regimes.

For ω-dependent κ(ω) or n(ω), instead of Eq. (B3), the
master equation is derived in the Born-Markov approxi-
mation but without the RWA to the SEC as

+n(ων,µ)(cid:16)h ˆQ, ˆρ ˆQµ,νi +h{ ˆQµ,ν}† ˆρ, ˆQi(cid:17)o . (B6)

Compared with Eq. (B4), the lowering and raising com-
ponents ˆQ↓ and ˆQ↑ are replaced by the original operator
ˆQ, while both of them are of the non-Lindblad form.

In this way, there are two kinds of the non-Lindblad
forms: One is found in Eq. (B4), which appears also in
the weak and normally strong light-matter interaction
regimes in the case of ω-dependent κ(ω) or n(ω). The
other is found in Eqs. (B3) and (12), whose diﬀerence
from the Lindblad master equation is highlighted in the
ultra-strong light-matter interaction regime with a large
broadening. In order to analyze the latter non-Lindblad
form, we considered the ω-independent κ with n(ω) = 0
in the main text. Eq. (B6) contains both the two non-
Lindblad contributions.

Note that, if all the environments have the same tem-
perature T and bosonic environments show the Bose dis-
tribution n(ω) = 1/(eω/kBT − 1), the thermal state
ρ = e− ˆH0/kBT is obtained as a steady state of the mas-
ter equations in Eqs. (B4), (B5), and (B6). On the other
hand, if all the environments are at zero temperature, the
steady state is guaranteed as the ground state of ˆH0 in
the master equations in Eqs. (9), (12), although Eq. (3)
does not gives the ground state of the Hamiltonian such
as in Eq. (10) (in ultra-strong interaction regime) [30].

Appendix C: Calculation of absorption by

Lindblad-type equations

Whereas the absorption can be calculated by the sim-
ple equation set for the non-Lindblad-type quantum

Langevin equations as discussed in Sec. V B, here we
show the calculation method applicable to both the
Lindblad- and non-Lindblad-type equations not only for
the cavity loss but also for the excitation damping.

We ﬁrst deﬁne the array of operators for wavenumber

kj as

ˆvj =(cid:16) ˆQj ˆΠj ˆXj ˆYj(cid:17)T

where T means the matrix transpose. For both the
Lindblad- and non-Lindblad-type quantum Langevin
equations, the equation set for the positive-frequency
components is expressed as

spectra.

For deriving Eq. (C2), we in fact replaced all the low-
ering operators with the original ones such as ˆQ↓
j (ω) with
ˆQj(ω) for ω > 0. On the other hand, if we treat both the
cavity loss and damping in the Lindblad-type treatment,
we can get simple equation set for polariton annihilation
operators {ˆpj,ζ} by inversely replacing ˆQj(ω) with ˆQ↓
j (ω)

numerically, we get approximately the same absorption
spectra by Eq. (C11) and by Eq. (C8) with the Lindblad-
type treatment for both the cavity loss and damping. In
this way, ˆQj(ω) and ˆQ↓
j (ω) are approximately equivalent
in the parameter region of this paper.

Appendix D: Other numerical results

In Fig. 6, we show the absorption spectra for (a) cav-
ity length ℓ = 2πc/ωa and (b) ℓ = 4πc/ωa, where the
frequency of the lowest cavity mode is ck1 = 0.5ωa and

The cavity lengths are (a) ℓ = 2πc/ωa and (b) ℓ = 4πc/ωa,
where the frequency of the lowest cavity mode is ck1 = 0.5ωa
and 0.25ωa, respectively. We basically get the same tendency

γ = 0.5ωa, and Λ = 103. The spectra by the three ap-
proaches are plotted with diﬀerent lines. We get basically
the same tendency as the case of ℓ = πc/ωa discussed in
the main text.

In Fig. 7, we show the absorption spectra in the
Lindblad-type treatment for the excitation damping.
The three curves are calculated by the MBCs (solid
blue line), quantum Langevin equation with the non-
Lindblad-type treatment for the cavity loss (red dashed
line), and that with the Lindblad-type treatment for the
cavity loss (green dash-dotted line). The calculation
method of the latter two are explained in App. C. For the
calculation by the MBCs, we numerically calculated the
dielectric function εp(ω) of the medium in the Lindblad-
type treatment for the excitation damping as follows. In
the spatially inﬁnite system as discussed in Sec. IV C, the
quantum Langevin equation of the polariton annihilation
operator is obtained as

FIG. 7. Absorption spectra are calculated with the Lindblad-

we used the three approaches: by the MBCs (blue solid line),
by non-Lindblad-type equation (red dashed line), and by
Lindblad-type equation (green dash-dotted line). We consid-
ered (a) g = 1.0 and γ = 0.5ωa, (b) g = 1.0 and γ = 0.25ωa,
and (c) g = 0.5 and γ = 0.5ωa.
In contrast to the non-
Lindblad-type treatment for damping in Fig. 4, we can ﬁnd a
clear discrepancy between the spectra by the MBCs and by
the non-Lindblad-type equation concerning the cavity loss.
However, for the Lindblad-type equation concerning the cav-
ity loss, we get a larger discrepancy, and the tendency is sim-
ilar as in Fig. 4 Parameters: ℓ = πc/ωa and Λ0 = 103. kj up
to j = 2000 are considered.

For given ω, we numerically ﬁnd a complex wavenum-
ber kp(ω) satisfying this equation by using analytical ex-
pressions of ωk,ζ and Xk,ζ. Then, using this kp(ω) and
np(ω) = ckp(ω)/ω, the reﬂection coeﬃcient r(ω) is cal-
culated by Eq. (63).

As seen in Fig. 7, we get a clear discrepancy between
the absorption spectra by the MBCs and by the non-
Lindblad-type equation, while a larger discrepancy is ob-

tained for the Lindblad-type equation and these discrep-
ancies are reduced for smaller broadening as in Fig. 7(b).
Although it is hard to catch correctly the reason of
this new discrepancy between the MBCs and the non-
Lindblad-type equation, it is rather natural because the
two approaches are apparently diﬀerent, and the inﬂu-
ences of the RWA to the SEC of the damping are of
course diﬀerent in the two approaches. Since we did not
specify the mechanism of the damping, we cannot deter-

mine which spectrum is correct if the SEC Hamiltonian
of damping is really expressed such as in Eq. (6) or the
RWA to the SEC is justiﬁed by some reasons. However,
by looking the surprisingly good agreement of the spectra
by the MBCs and by the non-Lindblad-type equation in
Figs. 4 and 6, we should basically not apply the RWA to
the SEC and use the SEC Hamiltonian such as in Eq. (5)
for any SECs in the ultra-strong light-matter interaction
regime with a large broadening.
