We formulate a straightforward scheme of statistical mechanics for inhomogeneous systems that
includes the virial series in powers of the activity for the grand free energy and density distributions.
There, cluster integrals formulated for inhomogeneous systems play a main role. We center on
second order terms that were analyzed in the case of hard-wall conﬁnement, focusing in planar,
spherical and cylindrical walls. Further analysis was devoted to the Lennard-Jones system and its
generalization the 2k-k potential. For this interaction potentials the second cluster integral was
evaluated analytically. We obtained the ﬂuid-substrate surface tension at second order for the
planar, spherical and cylindrical conﬁnement. Spherical and cylindrical cases were analyzed using a
series expansion in the radius including higher order terms. We detected a ln R−1/R2 dependence
of the surface tension for the standard Lennard-Jones system conﬁned by spherical and cylindrical
walls, no matter if particles are inside or outside of the hard-walls. The analysis was extended to
bending and Gaussian curvatures, where exact expressions were also obtained.

INTRODUCTION

Equation of state (EOS) of a bulk ﬂuid system con-
tains the information about its thermodynamic behav-
ior. For known potentials, virial expansion is a common
method to calculate the EOS. This approach is usually
limited to a certain low density region such as gas phase
and must avoid transitions where the method is expected
to break down. Additional problems comes from series
convergence itself. Virial series are central for statisti-
cal mechanics (SM) theoretical development, hence they
are a recurring topic even after 150 years.[1–5] There are
several procedures that enable to obtain the EOS and
other properties of the ﬂuids by extrapolation of the ﬁrst
known terms of the virial series. Also, the ﬁrst virial coef-
ﬁcients are used in the development of liquid theories, like
density functionals or integral-diﬀerential equations.[6–8]
Virial series are not only a major tool for simple and
molecular ﬂuids, but for colloidal systems. This systems
are a mixture of two type of particles with a charac-
teristic big size diﬀerence.[9–11] Nowadays, virial coef-
ﬁcients and cluster integrals are still under study, even
at lower orders. There are several recent works about sec-
ond order coeﬃcients for diverse systems including inert
gases, alkanes, methane in water solution, and polymer
solutions.[9, 10, 12–14] Distinct interaction models have
been recently analyzed in this context: hard spheres with
dipolar momentum,[15–17] exponential potential,[18] and
the Asakura-Oosawa model for colloids.[9–11, 19]

One of the most studied interaction models for sim-
ple ﬂuids is the LJ. Modern studies based on molecular
dynamics simulation shed light on its basic properties
as viscosity, thermal conductivity, cavitation and melt-
ing coexistence.[20–24] Other works have focused on the

∗ iurrutia@cnea.gov.ar

curvature dependence of the surface tension.[25–27] The
virial coeﬃcients of the LJ ﬂuid have been calculated nu-
merically up to sixteenth order [28–31] and similar stud-
ies were done in LJ ﬂuid mixtures up to sixth order.[32]
Second order coeﬃcient is particularly relevant in this
work. It was evaluated exactly for the ﬁrst time in 2001
by Vargas et al.[33] and re-evaluated later.[34, 35] Gen-
eralizations to the so-called 2k-k LJ system[36] and ex-
tensions to non-conformal LJ model, were also done.[37]
We can mention that both, simple and colloidal ﬂuids are
continuously studied because some of their properties are
yet not completely understood, being the 2k-k LJ inter-
action one of the models that enable to analyze them in
a uniﬁed framework.

All the mentioned works about virial series refer to ho-
mogeneous ﬂuids. In fact, most of the theoretical devel-
opment about virial series is based on the original formu-
lation and thus only apply to homogeneous systems.[38–
41] Later generalizations adapted virial series expan-
sions to inhomogeneous ﬂuids and include external po-
tentials. The seminal work on inhomogeneous systems
was done by Bellemans in the sixties.[42–44] Further de-
velopments were done by Sokolowski and Stecki,[45–47]
and by Rowlinson.[48, 49]

In this work we brieﬂy introduce in a simple manner
the statistical mechanics approach to inhomogeneous sys-
tems in grand canonical ensemble and its virial series.
Our presentation focuses on a system of particles con-
ﬁned by the action of a general external potential follow-
ing Rowlinson’s approach. We discuss virial series at the
level of power series in the activity, where cluster inte-
grands and integrals play a central role. To make simpler
both notation and explanations the treatment is based on
a one component system, and to some extent, to particles
with pair-additive interaction. Despite this, extensions
to mixtures including polyatomic molecules with inter-
nal degrees of freedom, and generalizations beyond the
two-body potential that enable inclusion of multibody in-

teractions are discussed. Alongside, our treatment of free
energy, density distributions and other properties avoids
the necessity of a volume deﬁnition. All the questions
related to establish the volume and a reference bulk ho-
mogeneous system are also left to a separate analysis.

As an application we analyze the terms of second or-
der for spherically symmetric pair interaction potentials.
We solved for the ﬁrst time the second order cluster in-
tegral for LJ and 2k-k LJ ﬂuids under inhomogeneous
conditions. We evaluate analytically the cluster integral
in non-trivial conﬁnements: those produced by planar,
spherical and cylindrical hard walls. Our expression is
exact for the planar case. For curved walls we obtain
several terms of the asymptotic expansion for large radii.
To highlight the diﬃculty of the actual problem, we men-
tion that up to date the only cluster integral analytically
solved is that of second order and for the bulk case. This
term corresponds to the pressure second virial coeﬃcient.
Using the expression for the second cluster integral
we study the properties of the LJ gas in contact with
a curved hard wall, focusing on its surface tension. The
question of how the properties of an inhomogeneous ﬂuid
depend on the curvature of its interface is a long stand-
ing problem in statistical mechanics.[25] It has been thor-
oughly studied even for the interface induced by a curved
substrate.[26, 50–54] We present rigorous results based on
virial series about the curvature dependence of the prop-
erties of the LJ gas in contact with a curved wall which
are exact up to power two in density.

The rest of this work is organized as follows: In Sec.
II the SM of open systems with ﬁxed chemical potential,
temperature and external potential are revisited. Clus-
ter integrals are thus shown in their inhomogeneous na-
ture. Second order cluster terms are analyzed in Sec.III.
There, the case of spherically interacting particles lying
in a spatial region of arbitrary shape where they freely
move is analyzed. We emphasize on three types of simple
geometry conﬁnements: planar, spherical and cylindrical
walls. An application for the Lennard-Jones and the gen-
eralized 2k-k Lennard-Jones systems is given in Sec.IV,
where analytic expressions for the second cluster integral
are derived. Sec. V is devoted to analyze the inhomo-
geneous low density gas, its wall-ﬂuid surface tension,
Tolman length and rigidity coeﬃcients of bending and
Gaussian curvatures. Finally, in Sec. VI we give our
conclusions and ﬁnal remarks.

II. THEORY

We consider an inhomogeneous system at a given tem-
perature T , chemical potential µ (the number of particles
may ﬂuctuate) and external potential. The total poten-
tial energy also includes the contribution of mutual inter-
action between particles φ(n). Thus, the grand canonical
ensemble partition function (GCE) is

where λ = exp(βµ) and β = 1/kT is the inverse temper-
ature (k is the Boltzmann’s constant). In Eq. (1) Qn is
the canonical ensemble partition function

the study of small systems.[48] The main link between
GCE and thermodynamics is still

βΩ = − ln Ξ .

(4)

Some thermodynamic magnitudes could be directly de-
rived from Ω as hni = −βλ∂Ω/∂λ. Yet, other thermody-
namic magnitudes could be derived from Ω once volume
and area measures of the system are introduced.

In the GCE several magnitudes can be expressed as
power series in the activity z = λ/Λ3 (virial series in
z), with cluster integrals τk and cluster residual part as
coeﬃcients. The most frequent in the literature are

Here hni is the mean number of particles in the system
and δn measures the ﬂuctuation of hni. Cluster integrals
have played an important role in the development of virial
expansion for homogeneous systems. For inhomogeneous
ﬂuids it is convenient to deﬁne the n-particles cluster
integral τn as

τn = n!ˆ gn(x) bn (x1, . . . , xn) dx ,

where bn (x1, . . . , xn) is the Mayer’s cluster integrand of
order n. For simplicity, from here on we assume a pair

potential interaction i.e. φ(n) = Pi,j φij , φij = φ (xij ),
being xij = xj − xi the vector between i and j parti-
cles. Thus, bn (x1, . . . , xn) is the sum of all the prod-
uct of Mayer’s function f(cid:0)x(cid:1) = exp(cid:2)−βφ(cid:0)x(cid:1)(cid:3) − 1 that

involves n particles linked by f -bonds.
In this sense
bn (x1, . . . , xn) corresponds to clusters of n particles.[55]
Note that b1 = 1 and τ1 = Z1. For the density distri-
butions the same approach is also useful. The one body
density distribution is[39, 41]

with V the volume of the accessible region, i.e., the inﬁ-
nite space or the cell when periodic boundary conditions
are used.[39]

We have restricted our cluster decomposition to the
case of two body interaction potentials. However, in Ref.
[4] a systematic analysis of many body terms was done
for virial expansions in homogeneous systems. It seems
that with some minimal changes this approach is appli-
cable to the inhomogeneous case. On the other hand,
second order terms discussed in the next Sec. III are not
modiﬁed when many-body interaction between particles
are contemplated.

The ﬁrst non-trivial cluster terms are the ones of sec-
ond order. They describe the physical behavior of the
inhomogeneous low density gases up to order two in z.
Our study of order terms use and generalize ideas and
analytic procedures taken from Refs. [42, 47]. Thus, we
turn to one body density distribution, its second order
residual term is

qρ(2)(r1)y ≡ g(cid:0)r1(cid:1)ˆ g(cid:0)r2(cid:1)f(cid:0)r12(cid:1)dr2 .

(10)

Obtaining ρ(r) up to order z2 is reduced to solving this
integral. In what follows, to proceed in the evaluation
of order two cluster integrals, we gradually introduce
some conditions on the system. We consider a system
of spherical particles that interact through an spher-
ically symmetric pair potential, and then, the Mayer
function only depends on the distance between particles

r = (cid:12)(cid:12)r2 − r1(cid:12)(cid:12). We focus on the important case where

g(r) = 1 if r ∈ A, a region bounded by the surface ∂A,
and is zero otherwise. Therefore Z1 coincides with V , the
volume of A. The integrand of Eq. (10) can be written
as f (r) + [g(r2) − 1] f (r) and

ˆ g(cid:0)r2(cid:1)f(cid:0)r(cid:1)dr2 = 2b2 −ˆ (cid:2)1 − g(cid:0)r2(cid:1)(cid:3) f(cid:0)r(cid:1)dr2 . (11)
Here 1 − g(r) = 1 if r ∈ ¯A (where we introduce the
complement of a set ¯A = A \ R3) and is zero other-

side in Eq. (11) is ´A
f (r)dr2 the integral on the right is
´ ¯A
f (r)dr2. Turning to Eq. (10) we note that the term
g(r1)´ ¯A
f (r)dr2 is non-null only if r1 is in the neigh-
borhood of ∂A because r1 ∈ A, r2 ∈ ¯A, and r should
be small enough to obtain f (r) 6= 0. Thus, this integral
scales with the area of ∂A. Now we restrict further analy-
sis to cases where surface ∂A has constant curvature. We
change integration variable r2 to relative coordinate be-
tween particles and introduce u as the distance between
r1 and ∂A. For r1 ∈ A we obtain
f (r)dr2 = −ˆ ¯A

2∆b2 ≡ −ˆ ¯A

S(r, u)f (r)dr .

(12)

Here, S(r, u) is the surface area of an spherical shell with
radius r and center r1 ∈ A (at distance u from ∂A) that
lies outside of A. In Fig. 1 we give some insight about
geometry-related magnitudes for some simple shapes of
∂A. The ﬁnal result is thus

Integration schemes for ∆b2(r) and ∆τ2. Planar

outside of the region enclosed by the curved surface, while di-
agram (d) is for ﬂuids inside this region. Note that (c) and (d)
in the limit R → ∞ corresponds to (a) and (b), respectively,
which are equivalent.

Now we consider τ2, given by

τ2 ≡ ¨ g(r1)g(r2)f(cid:0)r12(cid:1)dr1dr2 .

and follow an approach similar to that used to transform
Eq. (10). For spherically symmetric pair potentials and
a region A with arbitrary shape we found

τ2 = 2Z1b2 + ∆τ2 ,

∆τ2 = −ˆ

A(cid:20)ˆ ¯A

f(cid:0)r(cid:1)dr2(cid:21) dr1 .

(16)

Remarkably, ∆τ2 is invariant under the interchange ¯A ↔
A no matter the details of the potential between parti-
cles. It implies that the inhomogeneous contribution to
τ2 is the same if the system is conﬁned in a box or if it is
conﬁned to all the space outside the box, ignoring of the
shape of the box. This in-out symmetry has been previ-
ously studied.[56, 57] It has a second interesting physical
implication: if giving a certain shape of A some terms of
∆τ2 should change its sign under the interchange ¯A ↔ A
all of them must be identically zero. For the case of a
surface ∂A with constant curvature we transform inte-
gration variables r1 and r2, to position with respect to
∂A and relative coordinate between particles. Once the
trivial integrations are done one ﬁnds

∆τ2 = −ˆ

S(u)(cid:20)ˆ ¯A

S(r, u)f(cid:0)r(cid:1)dr(cid:21) du .

(17)

Here, S(u) is the area of the surface parallel to ∂A at
a distance u that lies in A. Fig. 1 shows a picture of
the overall approach for some simple shapes of ∂A. Ex-
pressions for S(r, u) are known for planar, spherical and
cylindrical shapes of ∂A which shows that Eq. (17) is an
interesting formula to analytically evaluate τ2. Finally,

Both expressions enable to evaluate ∆τ2 for very simple
potentials like that of HS. Even though, Eq. (19) con-
densates the geometrical constraint in the inner integral
over u while the nature of the interaction remains in f (r).
Thus, Eq. (19) is a convenient starting point to analyze a
variety of not so simple pair potentials. Next paragraphs
introduce further simpliﬁcations on Eqs. (14) and (19)
for planar, spherical and cylindrical conﬁnements.

For planar walls

(15)

In the planar case S(r, u) = 2πr(r − u), r(u)min = u,

rmax(u) = ∞ and Eq. (14) takes the form

2∆b2(u) = −2πˆ ∞

u

(r2 − u r)f (r)dr .

(20)

Obviously, S(u) = A, which corresponds to the area of
an inﬁnite plane or the ﬁnite area of the hard plane
in the unit cell when periodic boundary conditions are
used. Although, rmin = 0, rmax = ∞, umin(r) = 0 and
umax(r) = r. Therefore, Eq. (19) reduces to

∆τ2 = −2Aa2, with a2 =

π

2 ˆ ∞

f (r)r3dr .

(21)

It is interesting to compare Eq. (21) with the bulk second
cluster integral of a system in a region of volume V ,

τ2 = 2V b2, with b2 = 2πˆ ∞

0

f (r)r2dr ,

(22)

that gives the bulk system second virial coeﬃcient B2 =
−b2. Thus we show that the diﬃcult of solving the terms
2∆b2(u) and ∆τ2 for an inhomogeneous ﬂuid conﬁned by
a planar wall is similar to the one of solving the bulk ﬂuid
term τ2. Both ∆b2 and ∆τ2 are known for the HS and
the SW systems.[43, 47]

For spherical walls

Again, we start from Eq. (19). Two diﬀerent situations
arise because the system may be inside the sphere with
area A = 4πR2 and volume V = 4πR3/3 or outside of it.
If the ﬂuid is outside of the spherical surface ∂A then u :

(0,∞), S(u) = 4π(R + u)2 and S(r, u) = πr(r − u)(2R +
u − r)/(R + u). On the opposite, for ﬂuids inside the
spherical shell ∂A one ﬁnds u : (0, R), S(u) = 4π(R− u)2
and, if u < r < 2R− u then S(r, u) = πr(r − u)(2R− u +
r)/(R − u) but if r > 2R − u then S(r, u) = 4πr2. For a
geometrical insight see Fig. 1 (c) and (d).
In the case of a ﬂuid that surrounds an spherical object

used in simulations and theoretical development.[58, 59]
Naturally, it is also the case of the hard sphere (HS) and
square well (SW) interactions. For HS and SW ﬂuids one

are consistent with those found previously using diﬀerent
approaches[44, 57, 60, 61][62] and serve here to cross-
check new expressions.

the same expression for w(r)] also applies to the case of
ﬂuid inside of a spherical shell. The situation of small
curvature is simpler to analyze by writing

∆τ2 = −2Aa2 + 2c2 + 2d2 ,

in R−1. If c2 does not converge, it is preferable to deﬁne

are functions of T (do not depend on R), and

Interestingly,

∆τ2 = −2Aa2 + 2c2 ,

(30)

In this geometry the system may be inside the cylinder
of area A = 2πR L and volume V = πR2L or outside of
it. Now, if the ﬂuid is outside of the cylindrical surface
∂A then, S(u) = 2π (R + u) L, else, if it is inside the
cylindrical wall then S(u) = 2π (R − u) L. Note that in
this case L is the length of an inﬁnite cylinder or a ﬁ-
nite length when periodic boundary conditions are used.
Analytic expression of S(r, u) involves elliptic integrals
of the ﬁrst, second and third kind[63] and are given in
the Appendix A. To evaluate ∆τ2 one may assume again
that the ﬂuid is outside of the cylindrical shell and ob-
tain a relation identical to Eq. (25). However, for the
cylindrical conﬁnement we do not ﬁnd a simple analytic
expression for w. For large R the series expansion of
S(r, u) provides the expression

erwise, it is convenient to deﬁne a single term ˜x2 = x2+d2
following the same criteria adopted in Eq. (29). When

the pair potential has ﬁnite range smaller than 2R the
convergence of c2 is secured, ﬁrst term of d2 is null but
higher order terms in R−1 do not disappear in the cylin-
drical case. We found for the HS and SW particles,

IV. CASE STUDY: τ2 FOR THE CONFINED

LENNARD-JONES FLUID

Virial series in general and speciﬁcally its truncation at
second order coeﬃcient B2 have been thoroughly studied
for a long time because they enable to analytically de-
scribe the properties of diluted homogeneous ﬂuids. Be-
yond the case of HS and SW potentials, analytic expres-
sions of B2(T ) were found for the 12-6 Lennard-Jones
(LJ) potential[33], for the 2k-k LJ potential[36] and oth-
ers LJ-like potentials.[37] For molecular dynamic simu-
lation purposes the truncation of interaction potential
at ﬁnite range is necessary. Yet, virial coeﬃcients of
truncated-LJ systems were numerically evaluated.[59]

Virial series are not a standard method to study
inhomogeneous ﬂuids.
Nonetheless, a few recent
works studied the inhomogeneous HS ﬂuid under this
framework.[55, 64, 65] In the case of inhomogeneous LJ
ﬂuid we found a single work that based on this series
(truncated at second order) study the adsorption of 12-
6 LJ gas on a planar attractive wall.[47] There, second
order cluster integral is numerically evaluated. In the fol-
lowing, cluster integral τ2 for the inhomogeneous 2k-k LJ
conﬁned by hard walls of constant curvature is evaluated
analytically for the ﬁrst time.

A.

τ2 for the inhomogeneous Lennard-Jones ﬂuid

Here we evaluate analytically τ2 by applying to Eqs.
(20) and (21) some ideas and procedures partially taken
from Refs. [33, 36]. We generalize those calculus to ob-
tain the second cluster integral for planar spherical, and
cylindrical conﬁnement.

One can observe that several of the integrals appearing
in Sec. III are of the form ´ a2
f (r)rmdr. For m = 2 (and
a1 = 0, a2 → ∞) it corresponds to b2 and B2 that de-
scribe homogeneous systems [see Eq. (22)]. We introduce
the 2k-k LJ pair potential

with k ≥ 6. The case k = 6 is the most used to model
simple monoatomic ﬂuids, yet higher values like k = 18
are utilized in studies of particles with short range in-
teraction potential as neutral colloids.[66] Thus, we shall

solve integrals of the type

with 0 < m + 1 ≤ k. In the case of Eqs. (21, 22) and (27)
the integration domain (0,∞) leave us with indeﬁnite
integrals. Changing variable to x = r/σ and deﬁning

the divergence. Once we integrate Eq. (42) by parts we
obtain

and Cq(0) were studied by Glasser [36] who gives closed
expressions for ν < 1 and 0 < q < 1, respectively, in
terms of Kummer’s hypergeometric functions.
In Ap-
pendix B we analyze the functions Iν,ε and Cq(ε), and
provide explicit expressions of them when 0 < ε ≪ 1.

In thermodynamic perturbation theories it is required
to obtain the eﬀective particle diameter of a ﬂuid. For
LJ ﬂuids this eﬀective diameter is also related with Cq.
Barker and Henderson had given two possible deﬁnition
that are widely used in the literature. The hard-core
reference corresponds to σeﬀ = − 1
k C1/k(1),[67] while
that adopted on soft-core reference systems is σeﬀ =

used to study ﬂuids systems using a variety of techniques
including density functional theories and the law of cor-
responding states.[69, 70]

We point out that our approach is directly extendable
to systems with dimension d 6= 3, e.g. d = 2. During
decades, several works aimed to study two-dimensional
ﬂuids composed by particles with hard-core interaction
(the so called hard discs) and also LJ potential.[71, 72]
In the case of a planar wall that cut the d-space in two
equal regions (one of which is available for particles), one
should replace in Eq. (39) m by d − 1 + m′, m′ = 0 cor-
responds to the bulk b2 and m′ = 1 corresponds to the
planar term a2. For a d-spherical wall one ﬁnds that term
of order Rd−2 (m′ = 2) is zero and m′ = 3 corresponds to
c2 (order Rd−3). Expressions of S(u, r), which measures
the volume of overlap between two d-spheres, were given
in Ref.
[73]. One can inquire what makes evident the
dependence of system properties on its inhomogeneous
nature. Thus, focusing in τ 2, the stronger conﬁnement
increases the ratio A/V . Also, temperature that makes
b2 = 0 enables to enhance the presence of a2, and T value
that makes null a2 enables to enhance the eﬀect of c2. In
Table I we present the Boyle temperature i.e. T values at
which each of the ﬁrst three coeﬃcients of τ2, i.e. b2, a2
and c2, are zero. There the critical temperature is also
given for comparison. Given that c2 for k = 6 depends on
both T and R [see Eq. (51)] there is not a unique value
of T at which c2 = 0. As an example of the obtained
results in Fig. 2 we plot the dependence with R of the
second cluster integral for the 12-6 LJ ﬂuid conﬁned in
a spherical pore. Curves show the asymptotic expression
for large R, including terms of order O(R−18) (order ε3
in d2). Dots show numerical evaluation of the exact in-
tegral τ2. The highest considered T is near to the Boyle

example ∂(Ω+P V )

the system and pressure of the reservoir at the same tem-
perature and chemical potential, γ deﬁned in Eq. (59)

Once the decomposition of Ω in Eq. (59) is assumed
there is a third exact sum rule that applies to spherical
and cylindrical conﬁned system

temperature for b2 therefore in this case τ2 is driven by
a2A. For very small radius exact results smoothly goes
to zero. Yet, for R . 0.6 curves diﬀer signiﬁcantly form
the exact results and isotherms of smaller temperature
separates at higher radii from the exact result. We ob-
served a similar behavior for other values of k > 6 which
do not include the logarithmic dependence with R.

V. RESULTS

Before analyzing the consequences on the LJ system of
the obtained expressions for τ2, it is interesting to discuss
in the present context some general relations known as
exact sum rules. Once the volume notion is introduced,
a further step in the thermodynamic interpretation of
the conﬁned system can be done. Starting from Ω we
obtain the pressure that the system makes on the sur-
rounding walls, the pressure on the wall Pw, that is the
key magnitude of the reversible work term in the ﬁrst law
of thermodynamics. For systems conﬁned by constant-
curvature walls and using the volume notion deﬁned in
Sec. III Pw is

Pw = −

dR
dV

∂Ω

∂R(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)µ,T

.

(57)

The relation between Pw, T and z is the basic EOS of
these inhomogeneous systems. It is not necessary to deal
with bulk or surface properties. A second exact relation
valid for constant-curvature hard conﬁnement is

Pw = ρcT,

(58)

which is a contact theorem with ρc = ρ(r = R). Both
exact relations (57) and (58) are a convenient starting
point to analyze the system properties.

For the three geometrical constraints we decompose Ω

in Eq. (1) as

Ω = −P V + γA ,

∆P = γ

∂γ

∂R(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)µ,T

(60)

where ∆P = ± (Pw − P ). Plus sign applies to the case
of ﬂuid in the outer region while minus sign applies to
opposite. The parameter sc is: sc = 2 if the surface
is a sphere, sc = 1 for the cylinder. To include planes
one may consider sc = 0. Eq.
(60) is the exact form
that takes the Laplace equation in this context. In the
case of the LJ ﬂuid our expression of τ2(R) enables to
analytically evaluate Ω, Pw, ρc and γ up to order z2.

A. Low density inhomogeneous gas

We consider the unconstrained open system [m → ∞
in Eq.
(1)] of LJ particles at low density conﬁned by
planar, spherical or cylindrical walls. Then, we truncate
Eq. (5) at second order to obtain βΩ = −zV − z2 1
2 τ2.
Therefore the ﬁrst consequence of our calculus on τ2
is that grand-free energy of 2k-k LJ ﬂuid contains the
expected terms linear with volume and surface area.
These terms are identical for the three studied geome-
tries. At planar geometry, no extra term exist as sym-
metry implies for all τi. In case of spherical conﬁnement
a term linear with total normal curvature of the surface
A2/R ∝ R does not appear at order z2 but it should exist
at higher ones. A term linear with total Gaussian cur-
vature A/R2 ∝ constant exist. Extra terms that scales
with negative powers of R were also found. A logarith-
mic term proportional to ln R−1 was recognized only for
k = 6. The cylindrical conﬁnement is not very diﬀerent
to the spherical case. We simply trace the diﬀerences:
even that Gaussian curvature is zero in this geometry, a
term linear with A/R2 ∝ L/R was found. The existence
of a logarithmic term for k = 6 was veriﬁed, in this case
it was proportional to L ln R−1/R.

tions).

respectively. In Eq. (64) higher order terms are: O(R−4)
for k > 6, but includes terms O(R−2) if k = 6 (even, it is
exact up to order R−2 ln R). Thus, results of Eqs. (48)
to (52) enable us for the ﬁrst time to study on analytic
grounds the wall-ﬂuid surface tension of the LJ systems
for planar, spherical and cylindrical walls, at low density.
In Fig.3 it is shown the surface tension of the 2k-k LJ
gas conﬁned by a planar wall for diﬀerent values of k.
All cases show a monotonous decreasing behavior of γ
with T . At low temperatures γ is positive (it diverges as
exp(1/T ) as T → 0) and becomes negative at high tem-
peratures. The temperature where γ is zero is lower for
bigger k (temperatures are given in Tab. I, second row).

In the case of the 12-6 LJ system we found γ ≈ 0.035
at T = 0.5 and γ ≈ 0.01 at T = 5 (ρb = 0.1). Scale on
the right shows γ/ρ2
b which is independent of density. In
the case of the spherical-wall the curvature dependence
of the surface tension is plotted in Fig. 4. There, results
for the 12-6 system at diﬀerent temperatures are shown.
At T ? 9 ﬂuid-wall surface tension is negative even at
R → ∞. This negative sign of γ is characteristic of sys-
tems with repulsive interaction such as the hard sphere
ﬂuid. Fig. 4 is also related with the excess surface ad-
sorption Γ = (< n > − < n >b) /A. Series expansion of
Γ up to order z2 and ρ2
b∆τ2/A,
respectively. Thus, up to the order of Eq.
(63) it is
Γ = −2γ/T . This shows that isotherms of γ(R) shown
in Fig. 4 also plot isotherms of −ΓT /2. Naturally, the
same apply to the planar case shown in Fig.3 and to the
cylindrical one (not shown).

b are: Γ = z2∆τ2/A= ρ2

It must be noted that γ(R) and Γ depend on the
adopted surface of tension that we ﬁxed at r = R where
ρ(r) drops to zero. This ﬁxes the adopted reference re-
gion characterized by measures V , A and R. The eﬀect of
introducing a diﬀerent reference region on γ(R) was sys-
tematically studied in Refs. [64, 76] for the hard-sphere
ﬂuid and the same approach applies to the LJ ﬂuid.

Stewart and Evans studied the interfacial properties of
a hard spherical cavity immersed in a ﬂuid using eﬀec-
tive interfacial potentials and density functional theory.
They used an interaction potential between particles that
contains both a hard sphere repulsion and an attractive
−r−6 component, the latter similar to that appearing in
the 12-6 LJ potential.[53] In Fig. 3 therein it was pre-
sented a plot of βγ as a function of R−1 at T = 0.991
and ρ = 0.018. For comparison we present in Fig. 5 the
curve found by Stewart and Evans (dashed) and our re-
sults for the 12-6 LJ gas obtained using Eq. (62) at the
same temperature and density (continuous). We observe
an overall discrepancy of ∼ 10% which is acceptable by
virtue of the disparity in the interaction model. Two ma-
jor diﬀerences between both curves account most of the
observed discrepancy. On the one hand, the ordinate at

B. Curvature expansion

We follow Ref. [25] to analyze the curvature expansion
of the surface tension. There, the analysis was done for
the vapor ﬂuid interface. Helfrich[77] gives an expansion
of the surface tension in the curvature up to second order.
Applied to the sphere and cylinder symmetry Helfrich
expansion of γ(R) gives

diﬀerence in the observed planar-wall surface tension is
a direct consequence of the disparity in the interaction
model. Even though, the diﬀerence in the slope is pro-
duced by our second order truncation that forces a zero
slope. In dot-dashed we present a version of dashed line
compensated to give δ(R−1 → 0) = 0. This last line was
shifted an arbitrary value and plotted in dot-dot-dashed
to make clear the coincidence with the obtained virial
series result.
In this case the shape is identical which
suggest that ln R/R2 and R−2 terms are not susceptible
to the disparity of potentials.

Remarkably, it is a universal value in the sense that it is

It is trivial to verify that this relation also applies to HS
and SW particles.[64]

For long-ranged interactions as in the case of 12-6 LJ
the existence of the discussed logarithmic terms makes
the Helfrich expansion[77] of γ(R) in power of R−1 no
longer valid. Thus, for k = 6 instead of the Helfrich-based
expression Eqs. (65, 66), one obtains for the spherical
and cylindrical walls

both rigidities are temperature independent. Even for
k = 6 the quotient gives the same result k/¯k = −3/2,
found in Eq. (69). In fact, the origin of this fundamental
value is purely geometrical and lies in Eq.
(35). Ex-
pressions identical to those given in Eq. (72), but with
the diﬀerence between bulk densities in liquid and vapor
phases instead of ρb, were found previously for the free
liquid-vapor interface of the full (uncut) 12-6 LJ ﬂuid.[25]
in-
cluding all the ﬁnite range potentials (e.g. the cut and
shifted 12-6 LJ, HS, SW and square-shoulder, potentials)
produce the same value for the ratio k/¯k at low den-
sity. We also calculate the quotient of the next to R−1
terms between spherical and cylindrical cases, the ratio

Thus, essentially any pair interacting potential,

(cid:0)2k + ¯k(cid:1) / (k/2) = −8/3. Again it has a purely geomet-

rical origin and has the advantage of being independent of
the assumptions of a Helfrich-based expression for γ(R).
This result is in line with that found numerically using a
(second-virial approximation) DFT[54] for all the stud-
ied potentials: LJ, SW, square-shoulder and Yukawa, all
of them cut at ﬁnite range. The same geometrical status
claimed for k/¯k corresponds to the result δ = 0 + O(ρ3)
that is directly derivable from Eq. (16) and applies to
essentially any pair potential.

Based on the Hadwiger theorem it was proposed that
bending constant could be zero,[78] and thus, is unnec-
essary to include it in the expansion of γ(R). Eq. (69)
shows that the inaccuracy introduced by truncation of
the bending rigidity term in Eqs. (65, 66) is of the same
order than the Gaussian rigidity term (at least for hard
walls), and therefore is not well justiﬁed from the numer-
ical standpoint.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We give a simple and concise presentation of statistical
mechanics for inhomogeneous ﬂuid systems that is ap-
propriate to discuss virial series in powers of the activity.
The advantage of the adopted framework is highlighted
by showing short and explicit expressions of virial series
for the free energy and one- and two-body distribution
functions. Our approach, that avoids the introduction of
a priori assumptions about the free energy is, in fact, a
selection of diﬀerent formulations and ideas taken from
Bellemans, Sokolowski and Stecki, and Rowlinson, that
we managed to assimilate and develop a synthetical rep-
resentation.

Our point of view heightens the relevance of cluster
integrals by their generalization to inhomogeneous ﬂuid-
type systems. These cluster integrals, that reduce to the
Mayer ones in the case of homogeneous ﬂuids, are the
coeﬃcients of the series expansion in the activity of the
free energy. Extensions of the concept of cluster inte-
gral and cluster integrand enable us to analyze under the
same approach the residual terms of distribution func-
tions. Virial series in power of either the bulk and mean

11

densities (the bulk density as in Bellemans approach, or
the mean density of the system as adopted by Rowlinson)
are thus considered as two of many possible choices for
the independent variable in the power series representa-
tion of free energy. It should noted that expansions in
the activity have shown to be simpler to analyze when
diﬀerent conventions for the reference region (its volume,
area and shape) are utilized.[64, 76]

Second order terms i.e. the second cluster integral and
the second order residue of one particle distribution were
analyzed in detail when the system is conﬁned by hard
walls of an arbitrary shape. To do so we incorporated
the advances developed by Bellemans, Sokolowski and
Stecki. By limiting the study cases of the applied ex-
ternal potential and the order of the expansion we were
able to shift the load to the solution of cluster integrals.
This is not minor since it reduces an originally general
and quite hard to address framework to a more straight-
forward method.
It should not be overlooked that the
hypothesis leading to Eq. (19) for ∆τ2 are common to
a lot of systems of major interest, at least in an approx-
imate manner. Then, ∆τ2 equation becomes a rather
powerful tool for tackling inhomogeneous systems in a
wide spectrum, specially for direct numerical solving.

By analytically solving the simpler situations for ∆τ2
we were able to expose the volume, area and other terms
that contribute, acquiring the capacity to discriminate
between bulk terms and a hierarchy of inhomogeneous
terms that characterizes the curvature dependence. Par-
ticularly, we focused in conﬁning regions with a constant
curvature boundary: planar, spherical and cylindrical
cases. As a simple application of our ﬁndings to a non-
trivial problem, we analyzed the second cluster integral
for the conﬁned LJ system. We evaluated analytically the
temperature and radius dependence of τ2 and qρ(2)(r)y.
The 12-6 LJ system was considered but also the more
general 2k-k LJ potential. It was found that second clus-
ter integral of the 12-6 LJ system contains a bulk, a sur-
face, and also a non-analytic dependence with R. The
latter are, in a spherical conﬁnement a ln R term and, in
cylindrical conﬁnement a L ln R/R term. For k ≥ 7 these
logarithmic dependencies are absent (sphere) or may ap-
pear at higher order in R−1 (cylinder) but in all cases
a series of terms proportional to negative powers of R
were also obtained. We obtained the free energy of the
inhomogeneous systems by truncation of the virial series
order at order z2 and ρ2
b, that directly maps our ﬁndings
on τ2 to free energy. The existence of Log terms in the
free energy of ﬂuids in contact with hard spherical sur-
faces was hypothesized by Henderson and later discussed
by Stecki and col. [79–82]. Our results demonstrate this
conjecture for the 12-6 LJ system.

The ﬂuid-substrate surface tension was also analyzed
using second order truncated virial series. In the planar
case we found an exact expression that describes γ(T ) for
all k ≥ 6. We evaluated the temperature below that the
surface tension becomes negative. For k = 6 it is 6.8×Tc.
The prefactor decreases with k being 2.2 × Tc for k = 18

that corresponds to short range potentials proper of col-
loidal particles. Based on the virial series approach the
leading order curvature correction to the surface tension
γ(R) for all the 2k-k LJ ﬂuids in contact with spherical
and cylindrical surfaces was found analytically, at order
two in density. This correction is the same when the sys-
tem is inside of the surface or outside of it. For k = 6
in the case of both spherical and cylindrical conﬁnement
surface tension scales with ln R/R2. For the k ≥ 7 the
ﬁrst correction is order R−2. In all cases the correction
is negative for high temperatures. The truncation of the
12-6 LJ potential produces a signiﬁcant change in the de-
pendence of γ(R) with R, vanishing the ln R/R2 depen-
dence and producing a simple correction. We observed
that the term of order R−1 is zero for k ≥ 6. This shows
that Tolman length is zero up to order ρ2
b but it should
appear at higher order ones, probably at order ρ3
b.

The curvature dependence of surface tension for ﬂuid
interfaces is a highly studied issue.[23, 25, 64, 83–89] In
particular, the amplitude and sign of bending and Gaus-
sian rigidity constants are a matter of discussion. We
evaluated analytically both rigidities, k and ¯k, at order z2
and ρ2
b. For k = 6 both bending and Gaussian rigidities
are independent of temperature, being k > 0 and ¯k<0.
Other values of k are characterized by a temperature
where both rigidities change its sign. For all k ≥ 6 we
obtained the universal ratio k/¯k = −3/2 which is a ther-
modynamic result based on pure geometrical grounds.

12

This value is exact when terms of order ρ3
b are truncated
from the EOS of the system. We obtain the same result
for any ﬁnite range potential.

Previous works have discussed the existence of ln R
non-analytic dependence of the surface tension with the
curvature when dispersion forces are present and mul-
tiple techniques were used with this purpose includ-
ing DFT, MonteCarlo, Molecular dynamics and eﬀective
Hamiltonian.[90, 91] These terms were found at the gas-
liquid interface of droplets and bubbles,[25] and at the
curved wall-ﬂuid interface.[26, 53] In wetting and dry-
ing at curved surfaces it was also identiﬁed.[50–53] In all
those cases the magnitude of this term is indirectly eval-
uated:
it may involve the truncation of the interaction
potential, the ﬁtting of density proﬁles and/or surface
tension curves, the use of approximate EOS for the bulk
system or more than one of this approximations. This
yields results that require deeper testing. Our analytical
approach is a contribution in that direction.

The surface term S(r, u) was evaluated by taking the
derivative of the volume of intersection between a cylin-
der and a sphere which can be expressed in terms of el-
liptic integrals.[92] For the case 0 < r < 2R we obtained

otherwise. Also, K(Q), E(Q) and Π(x, Q) are the
complete elliptic integral of the ﬁrst, second and third
kind, respectively (here Q is the parameter and x the
characteristic).[93] Note that S(r, u) is a smooth func-
tion at u = 0, because the discontinuity in Θ(−u) com-
pensates with a discontinuity in Π(cid:16)1 − r2

its series expansion. For the case r > 2R we found

which combined with Eqs. (B2) and (B3) enables to ob-
tain the expansion of Iν,ε for any real value ν > 1, that
completes our procedure to obtain Iν,ε with ν ∈ R. For
ν > 1 Eq. (B4) shows that the divergence is driven by

Appendix C: Coeﬃcients for cylindrical walls

For cylindrical walls we also analyzed separately the
cases k > 6 and k = 6. If k > 6, x2 is proportional to c2

with a series expansion d2 ≈ L(2R)5−k. The coeﬃcient of
this main term in d2 was left unevaluated because higher
order functions contribute to this order. The case k = 8

requires a special attention because its series gives d2 ≈
L ln R/R3.

Note that R−3C4/3(ε) ≈ R−1 and the same occurs with
higher order terms like R−5C5/3(ε) ≈ R−1. Therefore,
we truncated ˜x2 to this order which results in the expres-
sion for x2 written in Eq. (53) and leaves d2 unevaluated.
