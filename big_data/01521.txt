Abstract

The properties of binary mixtures of dimethylsulfoxide and glycerol, measured by sev-

eral techniques, are reported. Special attention is given to those properties contributing

or aﬀecting chemical reactions. In this respect the investigated mixture behaves as a

relatively simple solvent and it is especially well suited for studies on the inﬂuence of

viscosity in chemical reactivity. This is due to the relative invariance of the dielectric

properties of the mixture. However, special caution must be taken with speciﬁc solva-

tion, as the hydrogen-bonding properties of the solvent changes with the molar fraction

of glycerol.

Introduction

Most of the theories describing chemical reactions and dynamics in liquid solutions are ex-

pressed in terms of macroscopic properties of the system. 1,2 This is because they often derive

from or are related to continuous descriptions of liquids. Reaction-diﬀusion problems, 3 sol-

vation dynamics, 4,5 vibrational relaxation of highly excited molecular states, 6,7 isomerization

reactions, 8,9 electron transfer, 10–12 proton transfer, 13 or energy transfer, 14 are thus correlated

to solvent parameters like viscosity, dielectric constant, density or refractive index. There-

fore, it is often desirable to vary one of them keeping the others constant fulﬁlling the ceteris

paribus condition. 15 Simultaneously, it is also necessary to know if the system under study,

the probe molecule or the reactants, are prone to build H-bonds with the solvent or are

inert to them. The diﬃculty arises because most of the homologous series of solvents change

several of their properties on increasing the chain length. 16 For example, in linear alcohols

or nitriles the dielectric constant decreases at the same time that the viscosity increases.

Moreover, in the study of diﬀusion inﬂuenced reactions, the key control parameter is the

viscosity and there are no solvent families that oﬀer a wider range of this property than

alcohols. If the reaction of interest is electron transfer, the Marcus solvent reorganization

energy is proportional to the Pekar factor, a function of the refractive index and the dielectric

2

constant; 17 thus changing viscosity to determine the inﬂuence of diﬀusion in electron transfer

reactions requires keeping this factor constant. The use of alcohols having the advantage

of providing with a wide range of viscosities introduces changes in the other parameters.

Another possibility is to change either temperature or pressure, 18 but all the solvent prop-

erties, as well as the intrinsic reaction rate, are sensitive in larger or lesser degree to them.

The only remaining solution in this case is to use solvent mixtures. 19 A wise selection of the

binary components may provide with the control of one of the four important parameters

mentioned above. However, there are also problems associated with those mixtures. First,

if the dielectric constants of the components are too disparate, the solvation shell around

the solutes can be enriched with one of them. 20,21 Second, if the H-bonding properties of

the components are diﬀerent and the solute is sensitive to them, the solvation properties

may change dramatically too. Finally, micro-environments may show up in some of these

mixtures that can signiﬁcantly aﬀect the diﬀusion of the reactants. 22,23

One of the most successfully used mixtures to study diﬀusion-assisted reactions consists of

dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and glycerol (GLY). It has been employed in the study of ﬂu-

orescence quenching reactions by electron transfer, as well as in the recombination of the

products. 24–31 It has served to test and articulate the encounter theories that have demon-

strated to be very accurate in the quantitative description of bimolecular reactions. Recently,

it was employed in the comparison with room temperature ionic liquids to clarify the role of

diﬀusion, leading to the conclusion that nothing peculiar is to be found in the latter case, at

least with respect to photo-induced bimolecular electron transfer. 30 In regard to dielectric

constants, refractive index, densities and molecular sizes, the two solvents are very similar

(cf. Table 1). Only viscosity diﬀers greatly, as well as the H-bonding donation ability, in
terms of the Kamlet-Taft (KT) empirical parameters (α, β, π∗). 32 It is the aim of this com-

munication, not only to summarize these macroscopic properties, but also to shine light on

the solvation properties at the molecular scale.

Two research groups have recently reported on the solvation properties of DMSO-GLY ﬁnd-

3

ing the presence of micro-heterogeneities. 33–35 In ref. 33 confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy

was used. From the ﬂuorescence correlation curves (FCS) and the burst integrated ﬂuores-

cence lifetimes (BIFL) distributions, it was concluded that there are enriched environments

of DMSO through which the ﬂuorescent coumarin probes diﬀuse faster than would corre-

spond to the macroscopic viscosity. In references 34 and 35 the steady-state ﬂuorescence

spectra and the time-resolved ﬂuorescence decays obtained by means of nanosecond resolved

ﬂuorescence of several coumarins were reported. From the analysis of the solvation dynamics

and of the anisotropy decays a similar conclusion as in reference 33 was reached.

If micro-environments are present in these mixtures, as suggested by these works, 33–35 they

are expected to be relevant to molecular diﬀusion, either translational or rotational, which

should manifest in distinct ﬂuorescence anisotropy or time resolved diﬀusion dynamics. On

the other side, none of the previous studies dealing with bimolecular reactions in these mix-

tures has revealed such a peculiar behavior. The results of the measurements of both, bulk

and microscopic, properties of this mixture, obtained from multiple experimental techniques,

do not require invoking the presence of micro-environments, in order to be rationalized. We

will discuss and compare the previous reports in view of the current ﬁndings.

ρ, η,  and nD are the density, dynamic viscosity, dielectric constant and refractive index of
the solvent at 20◦C (the η value for glycerol was taken from ref. 36). µ, V and S are the
dipole moment, van der Waals volume and surface, respectively (see ref. 16). f (x) is the
relevant contribution from the dielectric constant,  and refractive index, nD, to the Onsager
reaction ﬁeld, and is deﬁned as f (x) = (x− 1)/(2x + 1). 37 α, β and π∗ are the solvatochromic
parameters for speciﬁc and unspeciﬁc solute-solvent interactions according to the Kamlet-Taft
scale (see ref. 38; note that we have recalculated the π∗ value of glycerol using the equation
given in this reference using the dipole moment given in reference 16).

Experimental Methods

Kinematic viscosities, ν, of DMSO and of the binary mixtures were measured at 20.0±0.1◦C

using an Ubbelohde viscometer (0C, IC and IIC viscometers from Schott Ger¨ate). The

densities were determined at the same temperature using 50 mL pycnometers with 0.1 mL

error. Dielectric constants, , of the pure solvents and binary mixtures were measured at
20.0±0.2◦C using a home-built LC circuit operating at approximately 400 kHz. The appara-

tus was calibrated using a series of organic solvents and the calibration curve deviates only

slightly from the Thompson equation for the ideal circuit. 39 Refractive indices, n20
measured at 20±0.2◦C using an Abbe refractometer from Atago (model 1T).
Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 50 spectrometer at room temperature (22±2◦C),
while steady-state emission spectra were recorded on a FluoroMax-4 (Jobin Yvon) at 20±0.2◦C

D , were

and corrected using a set of secondary emissive standards. 40

Time-resolved ﬂuorescence experiments were performed on ﬁve diﬀerent set-ups. Ultra-

fast time-resolved anisotropy decays were measured on a single-wavelength ﬂuorescence up-

conversion set-up with a full width of half maximum of the instrument response function

(IRF) of 200 fs, described in more detail in reference 41. In order to obtain reliable informa-

tion on the solvation dynamics, and given the vast discrepancies encountered in this type of

5

experiments (see e. g. reference 42 for a comparison of previous literature data) we opted for

performing time-resolved Stokes shift measurements on three time-resolved broadband ﬂuo-

rescence up-conversion set-ups (FLUPS) two of which (Ernsting group in Berlin and Vauthey

group in Geneva) based on the set-up described in references 42–44, and one (Laser Center

of the PAS in Warsaw) described in references 45,46, with a time resolution of 100-170 fs.

It is worth noting, that the dynamic Stokes shifts obtained on all three broadband set-ups

are in excellent agreement among each other (cf. SI for a comparison of both, spectra and

peak-shifts).

For dynamics longer than 1 ns single wavelength measurements on a home-built time-correlated

single photon counting (TCSPC) apparatus (time-resolution of 200 ps), described in refer-

ence 47, were used.

All NMR samples were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker 500 MHz 1H NMR Larmor frequency

spectrometer equipped with a DCH helium-cooled detection probe equipped with a z-gradient

coil with a maximum nominal gradient strength of 65 G/cm. The samples were prepared in

standard 5 mm NMR tubes, with the sample height being below 4 cm in order to avoid con-

vection caused by nonhomogeneous heating of the NMR tube above the level corresponding

to the top of the probehead. The NMR self-diﬀusion measurements where obtained using

a longitudinal encode-decode experiment including a double stimulated echo 48,49 and with

the Bruker pulse program dstegp3. The diﬀusion delay ∆ was set to 100 ms, the diﬀusion-

encoding ﬁeld-gradient pulse δ was set to 6 ms; with spoiling gradient of 1 ms. The top

amplitude of the sine-bell shaped diﬀusion gradient pulses, Gi, ranged from 1.3 to 55.3 G/cm

in 16 linear steps. The spectral window was set to 15 ppm and the free induction decay was

acquired with 32 k points. The recovery delay was set to 18 s to ensure complete relaxation.

Each spectrum was obtained by summation of 8 transients recorded after 16 stabilization

acquisitions (dummy scans) resulting in a total experimental time of 49 min. The FIDs were

Fourier-transformed after multiplication with an exponential function with a coeﬃcient of

5 Hz.

Analysis Methods

The KT parameters of the solvent mixtures were obtained by analyzing the absorption

spectra of 4 coumarins with known KT parameters (cf. Table 2) by performing a multilinear

regression analysis for each solvent mixture.

The ultrafast rotational dynamics of C153 were recorded with the single wavelength up-

conversion set-up between 520-540 nm by changing the polarization of the pump beam using

a halfwave-plate. Parallel, I||(t), and perpendicular signals, I⊥(t), were collected in successive

measurements and had a maximal intensity of approx. 20-30’000 cts (cf. SI for exemplary

time-traces). Rotational dynamics of C153 in the nanosecond range were recorded using

TCSPC by exciting with parallel polarized light and measuring successively I||(t) and I⊥(t)

7

(up to 30’000 cts in the maximum) by turning the analyzer in the emission path. Since

all rotational times were signiﬁcantly longer than the instrument response functions (IRF),

the anisotropy dynamics, r(t), was calculated and ﬁtted with biexponential decays without

accounting for convolution with the IRF.

The dynamic solvent response was analyzed by monitoring the peak position, νp(t), of a

lognorm ﬁt (see ref. 4 for the deﬁnition of the parameters) to the time-dependent spectra at

each time-step (cf. SI for exemplary broadband spectra and frequency shifts on the 3 used

Results and Discussion

Macroscopic Solvent Parameters

As is common for mixtures of organic solvents none of the macroscopic properties here

under study show a linear dependence with the molar fraction. The dependence of the

8

density, refractive index and dielectric constant of the solvent mixtures on the mole fraction

of glycerol, xGLY was evaluated using a Kister-Redlich type equation (eq. (6)), 54 while the

solvent viscosity was described using the equation of Nissan-Grunberg (eq. (7)): 55

Density

The densities of the binary mixtures allow to extract the excess volume of the mixture (cf.
Figure 1). It shows a minimum at xGLY = 0.48 of about −0.4% of the molar volume of the

mixture at this molar fraction (71.7 mL/mol), thus departing only slightly from the behavior

of an ideal mixture. The partial molar volumes of both components exhibit no extremes

at intermediate values of the molar fraction, and change monotonously with increasing the

glycerol content: decreasing for DMSO and increasing for GLY. Pronounced extremes in

mixtures of alcohols and amines with water in this quantity have been attributed to the

GLY, dashed line - DMSO) of the binary mixture of DMSO/GLY at 20◦C as a function of

presence of microphase segregation. 22,23,56 It is possible that in our measurements this eﬀect

is absent due to the strong basicity of DMSO, as stated by El Seoud in his analysis of

solvation in DMSO/water mixtures. 57

Refractive Index & Dielectric Constant

The refractive indices of the mixtures vary smoothly by less than 0.006 showing a maximum
at xGLY ≈ 0.2 (cf. Fig. 2). On the other hand, the dependence of the static dielectric constant

with the molar fraction of glycerol shows a clear maximum with a value of 52 at roughly

xGLY = 0.3. This maximum is 6 units larger than the value of the more polar of the two

constituents, i. e. DMSO (cf. Fig. 2). This kind of deviation from the linear behavior in

the dielectric constant is usually attributed to an increase in the number of dipoles in the

liquid with respect to the pure solvents. For reasons, hitherto unknown, our measurements

are at odds with those presented in ref. 58, where no excess dielectric constant could be

observed. A maximum of the static dielectric constant can be interpreted as appearing at

the mixture composition at which the number of highly polar heterodimers in the solvent is

10

largest. 58 However, as pointed out by Kaatze et al. 59 these data are in principle not enough

to extract this kind of conclusion as the orientational correlation between dipoles, composed

of at least three contributions in binary mixtures, may also change with solvent composition.

It is in any case to be considered that the hydrogen-bonding of GLY is strongly perturbed

with increasing DMSO content. This is especially important in the case of a solvent such as

DMSO, which exhibits a high H-bonding accepting ability. However, we emphasize that from

the point of view of continuum theories of the medium, such as the Born model, and thus

the study of chemical reactions this mixture represents an almost invariant combination for
the reorganization energy, λsolv ∝ 1/n2
D − 1/ of the solvent and the free enthalpy of electron
transfer reactions, ∆Get ∝ 1/. The change with the GLY content is minimal for both

quantities.

20◦C as a function of the mole fraction of GLY.

Viscosity

As can be seen in Fig. 3 the viscosity is the sole quantity of those reported so far that

changes greatly with solvent composition. However, no extrema are found in the entire

range of molar fractions studied, as the change is monotonous.

In combination with the

11

quasi-invariance of the dielectric properties of the mixture, DMSO/GLY mixtures seem at

this point an ideal system for studies requiring only variations of the viscosity. It is obvious,

however, that some other properties change as the H-bonding properties of the components

are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (see Table 1).

Figure 3: Viscosity of the binary DMSO/GLY mixture at 20◦C as a function of the mole
fraction of GLY. The black line shows the ﬁt of the Nissan-Grunberg equation (eq. (7)) with
the parameters from Table 3, while the grey line shows ideal behaviour.

Kamlet-Taft Parameters

The Kamlet-Taft parameters belong to an empirical scale based on the assumption of a linear

energy response of diﬀerent solvation processes. 32 It splits the response of an observable, like

the position of the electronic absorption band of a ﬂuorophore, to the process of solvation

into three major contributions from interactions with the solvent: the ability of the solvent to

donate H in H-bonds with the solute, α, to accept them, β, and the polarity/polarizability of
the solvent, π∗. Thus, it allows for the study of solvation when speciﬁc solvation eﬀects due

to H-bonding are important, and reveals through solute-dependent sensitivity coeﬃcient, a,

b and s, which portion of the relaxation is due to each of the processes in absolute energy

terms. This is not the sole existing scale of this kind, as for example the one due to Catal´an

12

and co-workers is also extensively and successfully used throughout the literature. 60

The absorption spectra of the coumarins used to obtain the KT parameters of the mixture

are shown in the SI. The shape of the spectra does not change with the glycerol content,

which provides consistency to the analysis method used. We have chosen to extract the KT

parameters solely from the absorption spectra since it is not guaranteed that at the largest

viscosities used here the stationary emission spectra completely originate from the relaxed

excited state. This is especially the case for the two coumarins with short lifetimes, i. e.

C152 and C152A.

The variation of the three KT parameters is plotted in Fig. 4. As expected, the largest
change is observed for α while the smallest change is observed for π∗, which can be related

to the relatively small change in dielectric constant as described above. In this case again

a very mild maximum is observed around xGLY = 0.3 although much less pronounced than
for the dielectric constant. This is perfectly congruent as the changes in π∗ monitor rather

the Onsager function, f () − f (n2
dielectric constant. Therefore, both the macroscopic dielectric constant measurements and

the molecular probe, via the KT parameters, report similar trends. β, drops monotonically

upon going from DMSO to GLY.

Dynamic Properties

Solvation Dynamics

Further details about the solvation of dyes can be obtained from the dynamic measurement

of ﬂuorescence. According to the works of Maroncelli and co-workers, the solvation dynamics

of C153 is insensitive to the H-bonding ability of the medium. 4 The total dynamic Stokes

shift of C153 in various mixtures of DMSO/GLY can be seen in Fig. 5 (see the SI for further

expanded experimental results). In all cases, the initial position of the ﬂuorescence maxi-

mum, ν(0), is similar - within the error of the measurement associated to the uncertainties

introduced by the chirp compensation and time resolution of the measurement. The overall

13

Figure 4: Dependence of the three Kamlet-Taft parameters on the mole fraction of GLY in
the DMSO/GLY mixture. The values at xGLY = 1 were taken from Table 1.

evolution of the peak shift correlates well with the viscosity of the medium, as can be seen

from the average relaxation-times listed in Table 4. The behaviour within the ﬁrst 0.5 ps

is almost identical in all solvents in terms of absolute shift and rate (compare Fig. 5 and

Tab. 4). We decided to analyze νp(t) for times longer than 0.5 ps, as the dynamics at shorter

times can not be described by exponential or Gaussian decays, partly due to the limited

time-resolution of the set-up.1

The shortest of the ﬁtted components are only slightly sensitive to the viscosity (with the

shortest, non-ﬁtted, decay component being almost viscosity independent) while the longest

vary signiﬁcantly. The time-dependent spectral lineshapes, on the other hand, do not show

any appreciable dependence on solvent composition (cf. Fig. 5). In particular, the lineshape

becomes increasingly asymmetric at longer times with the linewidth concomitantly decreas-

ing.
Another diﬀerence to be considered is the ﬁnal peak position, ν(∞): if solvent relaxation

were purely due to dipolar eﬀects (and thus describable by continuum models), the energy of

1This does not mean that the physics underlying these short times can not be explained by these functions,
but rather that without a much shorter excitation pulse available, it is diﬃcult to make proper assessments
of the very early dynamics.

the ﬁnal state should be the same at all values of xGLY. Nonetheless, we ﬁnd, that the larger

the GLY-content the smaller this value, or in other words, the larger is the total solvent

relaxation, ∆νtotal experienced by the probe in the excited state. In view of our ﬁndings

concerning the KT parameters, this could be attributed to the change in the H-bonding

ability. Not having any acidic group, C153 will mostly sense α, mainly through the keto

group. It is therefore possible that H-bonding with GLY relaxes the excited state of C153

15

additionally. This is congruent with the ﬁndings that the emission maxima of C153 in protic

solvents are slightly red-shifted with respect to those in aprotic solvents. 4 Ideally, in order

to test this hypothesis one should make use of a dye with considerable change of dipole

moment upon excitation to the ﬁrst singlet state, but without any sensitivity to H-bonding.

Unfortunately we could not ﬁnd such a dye, as in order to fulﬁll the ﬁrst of the conditions

donor and acceptor groups are used that always present some sensitivity to speciﬁc solvation.

Rotational Diﬀusion

Another way to probe the friction felt by molecular probes in liquid solution is to measure the

rotational diﬀusion of either the entire molecule or of part of it. Auramine O, for example, has

ﬂexible moieties capable of undergoing large amplitude motions leading to eﬃcient internal

conversion and thus decreasing the ﬂuorescence quantum yield. As the rotating groups are

relatively bulky, the solvent viscosity strongly inﬂuences the yield of emission. Here, we

16

make use of the systematic study 61 of this eﬀect for water-GLY mixtures.2 The relative

ﬂuorescence intensity change of Auramine O with increasing xGLY can be used to check

whether the local friction exerted by both solvent mixtures (water/GLY and DMSO/GLY)

matches the corresponding macroscopic viscosity measurements. Fig. 6 shows that this is

the case.

Figure 6: Dependence of the ﬂuorescence quantum yield of Auramine O, φﬂ, as a function
of solvent viscosity for water/GLY (taken from ref. 61) and DMSO/GLY mixtures.

A more detailed study of microscopic friction can be performed recording the rotational

dynamics of a solute, again C153, monitored via the decay of the ﬂuorescence anisotropy.

The starting anisotropy, always larger than 0.36, shows no appreciable dependence on xGLY,
as expected from the fact that the monitored S0 ← S1 transition does not change with sol-

vent composition. The anisotropy decay in all solvent mixtures exhibits biphasic behavior.

Both associated relaxation times increase with the same slope in a double logarithmic plot

with the viscosity, despite diﬀering by more than one order of magnitude (cf. Fig. 7, for the

experimental decays, refer to the SI).3 This indicates that rotational dynamics are rather

insensitive to H-bonding, following the same trend as viscosity, as otherwise a discrepancy

should be observed in the trends of these times. These present ﬁndings are in contrast to

those obtained in refs. 34,35. The possible origin of this discrepancy will be discussed later

on. The fact that the anisotropy decays bi-exponentially is connected to the non-sphericity

of the probe. 63 Considering a disc-like molecular shape, at least two rotational diﬀusion

coeﬃcients are expected with the rotational times being a combination of them. However,

common hydrodynamic models cannot explain this large diﬀerence in rotational times ob-

served here. This phenomenon was observed in the past by other groups in single component

solvents and several explanations were given. 64–67 A detailed study of these coeﬃcients is

beyond the scope of this article as it requires a detailed analysis that would not support

further the conclusions already extracted from the data. It is worth noting, that the rota-

tional correlation times in the binary mixtures are congruent with those obtained for C153

in dipolar solvents. 65 The fact that in the former work only monophasic decays in aprotic

solvents were observed, can be traced back to the larger experimental noise in these experi-

ments compared to the present data.

Translational Diﬀusion

Finally, another important quantity of special relevance for diﬀusion inﬂuenced reactions is

the translational diﬀusion coeﬃcient, D. A relatively straightforward way to test for the

trends of this quantity with xGLY is by measuring the self-diﬀusion coeﬃcients of the solvent

components by pulsed ﬁeld gradient NMR. This technique is not only commonly used for

this task, 68,69 but also routinely used to assess micro-environments. 70–73 Our measurements

have been performed both for d6-DMSO and GLY. As can be seen in Fig. 8, the trends in

both cases are similar, scale well with the known self-diﬀusion coeﬃcients for pure solvents

and are directly proportional to the Stokes Einstein value, DSE = kBT /(6πηRvdw), with the

and the ensuing dynamics.

van der Waals radius, Rvdw, given by Rvdw = 3(cid:112)3/(4π)Vvdw. It can be safely concluded from

these measurements that in the time scale probed by NMR there are no deviations from the

continuum solvent picture in these mixtures.

Comparison to Previous Results

Several recent works have reported on the presence of micro-heterogeneities in DMSO/GLY

mixtures. 33–35 In particular, refs. 34 and 35 report on the solvation dynamics similar to the

one we present here, with ref. 35 being carried out for 3 diﬀerent coumarins in the full molar

fraction range of GLY. The major diﬀerences between the experimental results presented in

our work and in ref. 35 are concerned with i) temporal and ii) spectral resolution:

i. The data in ref. 35 were obtained using TCPSC with an IRF of 70 ps FWHM, thus limit-
ing the observed spectral relaxation to 200-300 cm−1 for the range of GLY content studied

in our work. Compared to the present results, obtained with 170 fs time-resolution, this

tures at 25◦C versus the Stokes-Einstein value under stick boundary condition, DSE. Also

from ref. 16.

amounts to less than 15% of the total dynamic Stokes shift, in the best case.

ii. The spectral shifts in ref. 35 were obtained by applying the spectral reconstruction

method 64 using 15-18 time-traces (for a spectral range of 6 kK, corresponding to a point

density of 3 points/kK). The broadband ﬂuorescence experiments presented here, on the

other hand, consist of a total of 350 data-points for a spectral range of 10 kK (corre-

sponding to a point density of 33 points/kK) with the additional beneﬁt of relying on a

robust method for photometric calibration. 42

The observed disparities in the results are mostly owed to these signiﬁcant experimental

diﬀerences. For example, in addition to an ultrafast decay three relaxation times are here

observed - except for pure DMSO - while in ref. 35 only two are listed. The relaxation times

presented now range from 1-3 ps (absent in ref. 35), over 5-30 ps upon increasing viscosity

(also absent in ref. 35), up to the longest relaxation time ranging from 122-203 ps. This

latter component loosely matches the fastest resolved component of 88-420 ps ref. 35. The

longest component of 257-4485 ps in ref. 35, which corresponds to amplitudes of the dynamic

20

Stokes shift (in the case of C153) of 7-130 cm−1, is absent in the present observations. In any

case, even if these latter shifts are measurable, which is quite diﬃcult, given the low point

density of the experiments in ref. 35, they would merely correspond to 0.3-6% of the total

dynamic Stokes shift.4

Our ﬁndings are also partially at odds with similar data of Ghosh and co-workers on

anisotropy decays of coumarins in DMSO-GLY mixtures. 34,35 Using TCSPC with an IRF of

70 ps biexponential anisotropy decays were found. On the one hand, one of the rotational

lifetimes remains almost constant and equal to the rotational time observed in pure DMSO.

On the other hand, the second and longer component scales with viscosity and roughly agrees

with our results. Here we want to emphasize that in the present case the time resolution is

by almost 3 orders of magnitude higher than for the experiments reported in refs. 34,35. The

present experiments thus allow resolving the viscosity dependence of the short component

(see Figure 7), which is - at least at low and intermediate GLY content - signiﬁcantly below

the time resolution of the other reports. In addition, the paper does not clarify how the

rotational lifetimes have been obtained, as for anisotropy decays with rotational lifetimes

in the range of the IRF dedicated ﬁtting routines are required in order to recover correct

lifetimes. 74,75 This is the reason why in the present work the ﬁt to the short components of

the TCPSC at the lower viscosities measured with this technique, was not performed (cf.

Figure 7). It is thus possible, that the observed discrepancies in the analysis and interpre-

tation of the sub-100 ps rotational lifetimes are a consequence of the limited time-resolution

in the experiments of refs. 34,35. Besides, the long rotational lifetimes, as found by Koley

et al. at large GLY content, are to be treated with care, as soon as they signiﬁcantly exceed

the ﬂuorescence lifetime of the probe molecule.

We are not commenting the results of the other two coumarins measured in ref. 35 as they

seem to be more prone to speciﬁc solvation, what may be mixed-up with preferential solva-

4Comparing the steady-state emission maxima, ν∞ (18.46-18.02 kK), with their steady-state analoga, νss
(18.50-18.30 kK), presented here, it is found that the former are consistently slightly red-shifted with respect
to the latter, as expected. Therefore it is very unlikely that any part of the relaxation is missed in the present
dynamic measurements.

21

tion. We want to take the opportunity to emphasize that one should not mix the concepts

of preferential solvation or dielectric enrichment, 21,76 micro-heterogeneity (which is probe-

independent), 77 and speciﬁc solvation, 16,78,79 as seems to be the case in the commented

papers.

In reference 33 it was concluded that the mixtures of DMSO and GLY at viscosities of 10

and 33 cP show heterogenities. The experiments consisted of ﬂuorescence correlation spec-

troscopy (FCS) and burst integrated ﬂuorescence lifetime (BIFL) measurements obtained

from ﬂuorescence microscopy on four coumarin dyes (C151, C152, C152A and C153).5 From

both experimental techniques bimodal distributions for the translational diﬀusion coeﬃcient

(from FCS) and for the ﬂuorescence lifetime (from BIFL) of the coumarins were extracted.

However, the distributions obtained for diﬀerent coumarins as well as comparing the two

techniques (for the same coumarin) diﬀered. These diﬀerences were attributed to the fact

that FCS monitors long range movements while BIFL probes only a small environment,

sensed during the excited state of the probes. Following this line of reasoning of having sig-

niﬁcantly diﬀerent environments, the anisotropy decays - even though measured on the bulk

sample - should also be sensitive to the heterogeneities. In fact, ﬂuorescence anisotropy de-

cays have been extensively used in the past to discuss heterogeneous media and preferential

solvation. 56,76,77,80,81 More precisely, if two diﬀerent environments are felt by the probe in the

excited state, as proposed in ref. 33 for the DMSO/GLY mixtures, two long rotational times

should be observed, one belonging to a DMSO-rich environment and the second to a bulk

like one, with the former being invariant and the latter changing with solvent composition.

However, the present experiments show two relaxation times, which distinctly and system-

atically change with solvent viscosity, and no trace of another relaxation time corresponding

to pure DMSO, constant over the range of molar fractions, is observed.

The diﬀusion coeﬃcients obtained from averaging the results of FCS in ref. 33 amount

roughly to two to four times the expected value from the Stokes-Einstein equation depend-

5We should mention, that from the information in ref. 33 it remains ambiguous whether C153 or C480

was used, as the chemical structure corresponds to C153, while the attributed name is C480.

22

ing on the coumarin. Such deviations should be noticeable in the bulk measurements as

those reported here from the NMR experiments or from the anisotropy decays, but are not

observable in the presented experiments (see Figs. 7 and 8).

Another test for micro-environments can be made by rationalizing simply the total popula-

tion decay of the excited state of the probes. In ref. 33, BIFL experiments yielded, especially

for C152, two Gaussian lifetime distributions centered at around 1 and approx. 4 ns respec-

tively. This should translate into multiexponential ﬂuorescence decays6 as detected by bulk

measurements of TCSPC. 82–85 However, this is not the case neither for C153, nor for C152 in

none of the mixtures explored (see SI). We have in fact tried to account for a 2nd long lifetime,

by ﬁxing the lifetimes to the values observed in ref. 33 and leaving only their amplitudes free

(see SI). We found that the resulting amplitudes were negligibly small and the additional

lifetime did not improve the resulting reduced χ2. There is a change in the lifetime of emis-

sion of these molecules, which most likely is due to diﬀerences on the non-radiative decays as

the H-bonding properties of the solvent changes. 31 We have, nevertheless, no explanation for

the observed multimodal distributions observed in ref. 33, though it is quite intriguing that

the largest secondary contributions observed are for C152 and C152A, both with lifetimes

around 1 ns, while for the other coumarins, with a lifetime of 5 ns the secondary distributions

are almost negligibly small. At the same time, the additional lifetime for C152 and C152A,

in ref. 33, amount to 4-5 ns, which is not observable for these compounds in polar solvents

or in the presently discussed mixtures. 86

Conclusions

The combination of DMSO and GLY represents an interesting binary solvent mixture for

studying changes associated to viscosity in both intra- and intermolecular chemical reac-

tions, as it is the observed property exhibiting the most pronounced change upon changing

6In the limit of narrow distributions the observed ﬂuorescence decays simplify to sums of as many ex-
ponentials as maxima in the distribution, while in the case of broad gaussian distributions the ﬂuorescence
decays should follow functions described in ref. 82–84.

the molar fraction. The mixture’s dielectric properties remain almost constant, especially in

terms of the Onsager function. This renders the mixture especially interesting with respect

to electron transfer reactions, or, in general, processes controlled by the dielectric relaxation

properties of the medium. However two cautions need to be taken: H-bonding properties of

the mixture also vary greatly, and the dielectric relaxation is rather complex. The former

means that it is wiser to use reactants with no or little sensitivity to H-bonding, i. e. small

a in the KT terms. The latter implies, that whenever the process is still controlled at long

times by dielectric relaxation, the composition of the mixture will change these times as well

as viscosity. On the other hand, processes, which are fast enough to sense only the ﬁrst, and

most relevant, part of the relaxation of the dielectric, as is commonly thought to be the case

for electron transfer reactions, 87,88 will experience solvent relaxation times that are almost

invariant with the composition.

According to recent molecular dynamics simulations additional caution has to be taken when

the solutes are smaller than the solvent molecules, such as methane. 89 As in the present

measurements this case has not been addressed, with the investigated solute molecules being

signiﬁcantly larger, we did not detect these deviations. This is in line with the conclusions

reached by Araque et al. in reference 89.

From the former conclusions it is now well understood why these mixtures have been useful

in the study of the diﬀusion-inﬂuence in photo-induced electron transfer in the past. 24–31 In

these papers, a reaction-diﬀusion model 3 in combination with Marcus theory 17 for elec-

tron transfer was able to explain the experimental observations quantitatively. Finally,

in clear contrast to previous reports, we have found no experimental evidence for micro-

heterogeneities in all the measurements presented here.

Appendix - Fluorescence Lifetimes

In order to further test for possible micro-heterogeneities, as e. g. reported in ref. 33, we

opted for complementary measurements.

In particular, the multimodal distributions ob-

tained from burst-integrated ﬂuorescence lifetime (BIFL) experiments in ref. 33, should also

show up in bulk measurements of the ﬂuorescence lifetime of the corresponding ﬂuorophores

as multiphasic ﬂuorescence decays. Table 7 and Figures 15 and 16 summarize our ﬁndings for

two example-ﬂuorophores (C153, as it is the main probe in our study and C152, as the mul-

timodal behaviour has been reported to be very prominent) in three representative solvents

(mixtures). Depending on the chosen emission wavelength (using narrowband interference

ﬁlters) a single exponent or two exponents are necessary to properly describe (as judged

from the reduced χ2) the ﬂuorescence decays. The additional short lifetime (in addition

to the nanosecond S1 depopulation time), is necessary to account for features arising from

solvation dynamics. However, it should be noticed, that both, the amplitude and lifetime

(< 100 ps) of the short component are prone to large errors, given the low time-resolution in

our experiments (FWHM of the IRF of approx. 200 ps).
