Classical and Quantum Spherical Pendulum

Richard Cushman1 and Jędrzej Śniatycki2

Abstract

This paper extends the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization of the spher-
ical pendulum to a full quantum theory. This the ﬁrst application of
geometric quantization to a classical system with monodromy.

Introduction

This paper is a part of a program to extend Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions to a
full quantum theory of completely integrable systems. In earlier publications,
we discussed several examples of systems with one and two degrees of freedom
[8], [9]. In the present paper, we concentrate our attention on the spherical
pendulum. Our aim is to understand quantum monodromy of this system
[7]. More precisely, we want to understand how the classical monodromy
emerges from the quantum theory of the spherical pendulum.

The sperical pendulum has global actions A1, A2, where A1 is a contin-
uous function of the energy H and the angular momentum L, and A2 = L.
The Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions A1 = 2πn and A2 = 2πm, where n and
m are integers and  is Planck’s constant divided by 2π, give quantization of
the action functions A1, A2, and determine the joint spectrum of the opera-
tors QH and QL corresponding to H and L, respectively. Moreover, the pairs
(n, m) of integers, for which the Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions are satisﬁed,
label the basic states of a basis {σn,m} of the space of quantum states H of
the system. In geometric quantization, each σnm is a distribution section (a
generalized section) of the prequantization line bundle with support satisfy-
ing Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions with integers (n, m) [20]. This implies that
the basis {σn,m} of H has the structure of a local lattice. This observation
lead Cushman and Duistermaat to the notion of quantum mondromy [7]. In
the following, we refer to the basis {σn,m} as the Bohr-Sommerfeld basis.
The Bohr-Sommerfeld theory, as outlined above, does not lead to oper-
ators on the space H of quantum states that are not diagonal in the basis
{σn,m}. Though such operators exist, the theory does not relate them to

classical functions. In his 1925 paper [13], Heisenberg emphasized the im-
portance of operators that provide transitions between diﬀerent quantum
states. Since Bohr-Sommerfeld approach did not provide transition opera-
tors, it was abandoned in favour of the matrix mechanics of Born, Jordan and
Heisnberg [4], [5] and the wave mechanics of Schrödinger [17]. Dirac incor-
porated both approaches in his Principles of Quantum Mechanics published
in 1930 [11].

In [9], we showed that, if the Bohr-Sommerfeld basis of the space H of
quantum states of a completely integrable system has a structure of a global
lattice with boundary and the action-angle variables are globally deﬁned in
the open dense set of regular points of the energy-momentum map EM, then
the lowering operators that take σn,m to σn−1,m can be interpreted as quan-
tization of e−iϕ1. Similarly, the operators that take σn,m to σn,m−1 can be
interpreted as quantization of e−iϕ2. In this paper, we show that the Bohr-
Sommerfeld basis of the space of quantum states of the spherical pendulum
has the structure of the global lattice with boundary so that shifting opera-
tors are well deﬁned. However, due to the classical monodromy, our action-
angle variables fail to satisfy the deﬁning equation ω = dA1∧dϕ1 +dA2∧dϕ2
on L−1(0). Thus, Dirac’s quantization conditions allow us to interperate the
lowering operators as quantizations of e−iϕ1 and e−iϕ2 only in the comple-
−1(R), where R is the set of regular values of the
ment of L−1(0) in EM
energy momentum map.

2 The classical spherical pendulum

In this section we describe the geometry of the classical spherical pendulum.
More details can be found in [6, chpt V].

2.1 The basic system
and symplectic form (cid:101)ω =(cid:80)3
We discuss the spherical pendulum as a constrained system. First we give
the unconstrained system. Let T ∗R3 = R3 × (R3)∗ have coordinates (q, p)
i=1 dpi ∧ dqi = dθ, where θ = (cid:104)p, dq(cid:105). Here (cid:104) , (cid:105)
unconstrained Hamiltonian system (H, T R3,(cid:101)ω) has unconstrained Hamilto-
is the Euclidean inner on R3, which we use to identify T ∗R3 with T R3. The
i=1 is the standard basis of R3. Now constrain the system ((cid:101)H, T R3,(cid:101)ω)
Here {ei}3
to the tangent bundle T S2 = {(q, p) ∈ T R3 (cid:104)q, q(cid:105) = 1 & (cid:104)q, p(cid:105) = 0} of the

(cid:101)H : T R3 → R : (q, p) (cid:55)→ 1

nian

2-sphere S2 with symplectic form ω =(cid:101)ω|T S2. Again we use the Riemannian
Hamiltonian is H = (cid:101)H|T S2, that is,

metric on S2 induced from the Euclidean inner product on R3 to identify
the cotangent bundle T ∗S2 with the tangent bundle T S2. The constrained

H : T S2 ⊆ T R3 → R : (q, p) (cid:55)→ 1

2 (cid:104)p, p(cid:105) + (cid:104)q, e3(cid:105).

The classical spherical pendulum is the Hamiltonian system (H, T S2, ω).
The integral curves of the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld XH of the Hamiltonian
H (1) satisfy

= −e3 + ((cid:104)q, e3(cid:105) − (cid:104)p, p(cid:105))q

(2b)

on T R3. Since T S2 is an invariant manifold of (2a)–(2b), it follows that they
deﬁne the integral curves of a vector ﬁeld XH = X(cid:101)H|T S2, which governs the
motion of the spherical pendulum. A calculation shows that H = (cid:101)H|T S2 and
L =(cid:101)L|T S2 are constants of motion of the vector ﬁeld XH.
The angular momentum (cid:101)L of the unconstrained system ((cid:101)H, T R3,(cid:101)ω) is a
constant of motion, because the unconstrained Hamiltonian (cid:101)H is invariant

cos s − sin s

where Rs =

(cid:101)Φs. The inﬁnitesimal generator of the S1-action restricted to T S2 is X(cid:101)L|T S2,

So the constrained Hamiltonian H is invariant under the S1-action

(cid:55)→ Φs(q, p) = (Rsq, Rsp).

(3a)

(3b)

(4)

The invariance of the constrained angular momentum L =(cid:101)L|T S2 under the

S1-symmetry Φs shows that it is an integral of the spherical pendulum. Thus
the spherical pendulum is an integrable system (H, L, T S2, ω).

Using invariant theory we reduce the S1-symmetry of the spherical pen-
dulum. First observe that the algebra of polynomials on T R3, which are

invariant under the S1-action (cid:101)Φ, is generated by

π1 = q3,
π4 = q2

1 + q2
2

π2 = p3

π5 = q1p1 + q2p2

subject to the relation

1 + p2

2 + p2
π3 = p2

π6 = q1p2 − q2p1,

(5a)

(5b)

π2
5 + π2

6 = π4(π3 − π2

2), where (π3 − π2

2) ≥ 0 and π4 ≥ 0.

The algebra of polynomials invariant under the S1-action Φ (4) on T S2 is
generated by (πi)|T S2 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 6, which we will denote by πi, subject to
the additional relations
(5c)

π4 + π2

1 = 1
π5 + π1π2 = 0.

These relations are just the deﬁning equations of T S2 expressed in terms of
invariants. Eliminating π4 and π5 from the relation (5b) using (5c) gives

π2
2 + π2

6 = π3(1 − π2

1), where − 1 ≤ π1 ≤ 1 and π3 ≥ 0,

(6)

which deﬁnes W = T S2/S1, the space of S1 orbits of the action Φ on T S2.
In terms of invariants the space L−1((cid:96)) is deﬁned by π6 = (cid:96). Thus after
removing the S1 symmetry of the spherical pendulum, the reduced phase
space P(cid:96) = L−1((cid:96))/S1 is the subvariety of R3 with coordinates (π1, π2, π3)
given by

π2
2 + (cid:96)2 = π3(1 − π2

1), where − 1 ≤ π1 ≤ 1 and π3 ≥ 0.

(7)

Since the Hamiltonian H of the spherical pendulum is invariant under

the S1-action Φ, it induces the reduced Hamiltonian

(cid:98)H(cid:96) : P(cid:96) ⊆ R3 → R : (π1, π2, π3) (cid:55)→ 1

(8)
When (cid:96) (cid:54)= 0, then −1 < π1 < 1. So equation (7) may be written as π3 =
2+(cid:96)2
π2
1−π2
1
with coordinates (π1, π2) via the diﬀeomorphism

, where |π1| < 1. Thus P(cid:96), (cid:96) (cid:54)= 0, is diﬀeomorphic to (cid:98)R2 = (−1, 1) × R

To complete the reduction process, we determine the symplectic structure

on (cid:98)R2 and the reduced equations of motion. We begin with ﬁnding the

use Dirac brackets to compute the Poisson bracket { , }W on the orbit space

First we determine the set of critical values of the energy momentum
of the reduced Hamiltonian (cid:98)H(cid:96), that is, the 2-plane 1
map. The pair (h, (cid:96)) is a critical value of EM if and only if the h-level set
2 π3 + π1 = h in R3
with coordinates (π1, π2, π3), intersects the reduced space P(cid:96) ⊆ R3, deﬁned
by π2
1) with |π1| ≤ 1 and π3 ≥ 0, at a point of multiplicity
1) − (cid:96)2(cid:1) = π2
greater than 1. In other words, the polynomial

(cid:0)2(h − π1)(1 − π2
DQ(π1, π2) =(cid:0)
(cid:1). Clearly π2 = 0 and π1 is a multiple root of
which is obtained by eliminating π3 from the deﬁning equation of P(cid:96), has
a multiple root (π1, π2) ∈ [−1, 1] × R, that is, 0 = Q(π1, π2) and (0, 0) =
Ph,(cid:96) in [−1, 1]. Let ∆ be the discriminant of Ph,(cid:96), that is, ∆ = gcd(Ph,(cid:96), P (cid:48)
h,(cid:96)).
The set of all (h, (cid:96)) ∈ R2 such that Ph,(cid:96) has a multiple root in [−1, 1] is the
discriminant locus {∆ = 0} of Ph,(cid:96). Suppose that (h, (cid:96)) ∈ {∆ = 0}, then
for some s ∈ [−1, 1] and t ∈ R we may write Ph,(cid:96)(π1) = 2(π1 − s)2(π1 − t).
Equating the coeﬃcients of like powers of π1 in the preceding equality gives

Eliminating t from (13) gives the following parametrization of the discrimi-
nant locus {∆ = 0}

see ﬁgure 1. Thus {∆ = 0} is the union of two curves B±, which go to +∞
as s (cid:37) 0, are reﬂections in the h-axis of each other, meet at a right angle
and end when s = −1, that is, when (h, (cid:96)) = (−1, 0). Otherwise they do
not intersect. When s = 1 we obtain the isolated point (1, 0). The image of
the energy momentum mapping EM of the spherical pendulum is the closed
subset of R2 bounded by the curves B±, which contains the point (1, 0). The
set R of regular values in the image of EM is the interior of the image of EM
with the point (1, 0) removed. Thus R is diﬀeomorphic to an open 2-disk
with its center deleted and so is not simply connected.

of the energy momentum map EM, which is a semialgebraic subset of R2.

(cid:98)H(cid:96) : P(cid:96) ⊆ R3 → R : (π1, π2, π3) (cid:55)→ 1
Suppose that (h, (cid:96)) ∈ R. Then the h-level set of the reduced Hamiltonian
1 < 1(cid:9).
(cid:8)(cid:0)π1, π2, 2(h − π1)(cid:1)
((cid:98)H(cid:96))−1(h) = (cid:101)ρ(cid:0)H−1(h) ∩ L−1((cid:96))(cid:1) is a smooth submanifold of P(cid:96), which
±
1 are consecutive roots of the polynomial Ph,(cid:96) in [−1, 1]. Thus
it follows that (cid:101)ρ−1(cid:0)((cid:98)H(cid:96))−1(h)(cid:1) is the total space of an S1-bundle Σ with
is diﬀeomorphic to a circle. From the construction of the S1-orbit space P(cid:96)
base S1 = ((cid:98)H(cid:96))−1(h). Because P(cid:96) is homeomorphic to R2, we deduce that
((cid:98)H(cid:96))−1(h) is contractible to a point in P(cid:96). Thus Σ is a product bundle,
which implies that (cid:101)ρ−1(cid:0)((cid:98)H(cid:96))−1(h)(cid:1) is diﬀeomorphic to a smooth 2-torus

−1(R) → R

π = EM|EM−1(R) : EM

(15)
whose ﬁber over (h, (cid:96)) ∈ R is the smooth torus T 2
h,(cid:96). Since every ﬁber of this
mapping is compact, the ﬁbration is locally trivial. Moreover, the bundle
−1(B±) → B± is a trivial S1 bundle over R because each curve
π|B± : EM
−1(B±), which
B± is contactible to a point. An integral curve of XL on EM
parametrizes a ﬁber of the bundle π|B± is noncontractible curve and is the
limit of an integral curve of XL on T 2
h,(cid:96) when (h, (cid:96)) ∈ R converges to a point
on B±.
2.4 Action-angle coordinates
In this section we construct local action-angle coordinates for the spherical
pendulum.

The smooth locally trivial 2-torus ﬁbration π : EM

−1(R) → R satisﬁes
the hypotheses of the action-angle coordinate theorem for the integrable
Hamiltonian system (H, L, T S2, ω) describing the spherical pendulum, see
[6, chpt IX]. Thus about each (h, (cid:96)) ∈ R there is an open neighborhood
−1(V) in T S2 of the 2-torus
V in R and an open neighborhood U = EM

We now construct the action functions for the spherical pendulum.
According to the proof of the action-angle coordinate theorem in [6], the
action functions Ai on U are constructed by ﬁnding linear combinations on
U of the vector ﬁelds XH|U and XL|U , whose coeﬃcients are smooth functions
on EM(U) = V, which have periodic ﬂow of period 2π when restricted to
h,(cid:96). Here (h, (cid:96)) = EM(u) with u ∈ U. Since XL has periodic ﬂow of period
T 2
−1(R) ⊆ T S2, we may deﬁne the second action function on U as
2π on EM
A2 = L.
To construct the ﬁrst action function A1 we need to determine certain
of the vector ﬁelds XH

T (u) ∈ (cid:101)Γ1([0, 2π]). The time T is a smooth function of (h, (cid:96)) and does
not depend on the choice of starting point u in(cid:101)Γ1([0, 2π]), because it is the

Proposition 2.1 On EM
A1 is an action.
Proof. Suppose that (h, (cid:96)) ∈ R \ {(cid:96) = 0}. We have to show that the ﬂow
of the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld XA1 is periodic of period 2π. From (20) it

follows that dA1(h, (cid:96)) = (cid:101)T (h, (cid:96)) dh −(cid:101)Θ(h, (cid:96)) d(cid:96). Pulling back the preceding

−1(R) the function A1 = (EM)∗

equation by the energy momentum mapping EM gives

dA1(q, p) = (cid:101)T (h, (cid:96)) dH(q, p) −(cid:101)Θ(h, (cid:96)) dL(q, p),

∂(cid:96)

for every (q, p) ∈ T 2

h,(cid:96) ⊆ T S2. Applying the map ω(cid:91)(q, p) yields

XA1(q, p) = (cid:101)T (h, (cid:96))XH (q, p) −(cid:101)Θ(h, (cid:96))XL(q, p)

Now suppose that (h, (cid:96)) ∈ R∩{(cid:96) = 0}. Since the bundle π = EM|EM−1(R :

(cid:101)T (18a). Their proofs may be found in [6, chpt V and exercises].
1. On R \ {(cid:96) = 0} the function (cid:101)Θ is real analytic and odd in (cid:96), that is,
(cid:101)Θ(h,−(cid:96)) = −(cid:101)Θ(h, (cid:96)). Its principal value (18b) has range (−1,− 1

as (h, (cid:96)) ∈ R converges to (h(s), (cid:96)(s)) ∈ ∂R for some s ∈ [−1, 0).

We now determine the limiting values of the functions (cid:101)T , (cid:101)Θ, and A1 (19)
Proposition 2.3 Let (cid:101)T (s) = (cid:101)T (h(s), (cid:96)(s)), (cid:101)Θ(s) = (cid:101)Θ(h(s), (cid:96)(s)), and A1(s)

closed curve in C∨, which crosses the Re z axis twice: once in (−1, x−) and
once in (x+, 1). Note that the complex square root is negative just above the
cut [x−, x+]. In the limit as x∓ → s ∈ (−1, 0) we see that z − x∓ → z − x∗,

2.6 Additional properties of A1
The next proposition gives some addtional properties of the ﬁrst action func-
tion A1 (19).
Proposition 2.4 The ﬁrst action function A1 (19) is a positive real analytic
function on R \ {(cid:96) = 0}, which is continuous on R, but is not diﬀerentiable
on R ∩ {(cid:96) = 0}. Indeed, its partial derivative ∂A1
∂(cid:96) has a jump discontinuity
at R ∩ {(cid:96) = 0}. Moreover,

Restricting h and (cid:96) to be real variables shows that locally I is a real analytic
function on R. Clearly, I(h,−(cid:96)) = I(h, (cid:96)). To show that I is single-valued,
consider the positively oriented rectangular path Γε in R, which consecutively
joins the vertices (h, ε), (h + 1, ε), (h + 1,−ε), (h,−ε), and (h, ε), where ε is
chosen suﬃciently small and positive so that Γε lies in R and −1 < h < 1.

This shows that I is single valued on R, because Γε generates the fundamen-
tal group of R.
the fact that (cid:101)T , (cid:101)ϑ, and I are locally real analytic functions on R \ {(cid:96) = 0}.
That A1 is locally a real analytic function on R\{(cid:96) = 0} follows from (17) and
lim(cid:96)→0 (cid:96)(cid:101)Θ(h, (cid:96)) = 0 for all (h, (cid:96)) ∈ R \ {(cid:96) = 0}. Continuity on R follows
To show that A1 is continuous on R ∩ {(cid:96) = 0} it suﬃces to observe that

1. The fact that A1 has a real analytic extension to ∂R follows from the
proof in proposition 2.3. For (h(s),±(cid:96)(s)) ∈ ∂R for some s ∈ [−1, 0) we
have A1(h(s),±(cid:96)(s)) = 0. Therefore A1 is nonnegative on R = R ∪ ∂R.
Since (−1, 0) ∈ ∂R, we get A1(−1, 0) = 0. The next computation shows

We now show that limh(cid:37)∞ A1(h, 0) = ∞. First we demonstrate that

limh(cid:37)∞ h(cid:101)T (h, 0) = ∞.
Proof. When h > 1 and x ∈ [−1, 1] we have 2(h−x)(1−x2) < 4(h−x)(1−x).
So(cid:101)T (h, 0) =

a((cid:96)∗) < 0. Therefore by the implicit function theorem, there is
the hypothesis that [(cid:96)∗, (cid:96)∗] is the domain of (cid:98)Aa. Therefore (cid:96)∗ > 0. Then
the function (cid:98)Aa would have a maximum value h∗ at (cid:96)∗, since it is strictly
increasing in R ∩ {(cid:96) > 0}. Since (h∗, (cid:96)∗) ∈ R ∩ {(cid:96) > 0}, we have (cid:98)A(cid:48)

such that (cid:98)Aa is deﬁned. But this contradicts the hypothesis that [(cid:96)∗, (cid:96)∗] is
Therefore by the implicit function theorem, there is an (cid:96) > (cid:96)∗ close to (cid:96)∗
the domain of (cid:98)Aa. Hence (cid:96)∗ does not exist. A similar argument shows that
(cid:96)∗ does not exist. Thus the domain of (cid:98)Aa is (−∞,∞). This implies that the
image of (cid:98)Aa is [h∗(a),∞), where h∗(a) = min(cid:96)∈(−∞,∞) (cid:98)Aa((cid:96)) = (cid:98)Aa(0) To see
that the image of (cid:98)Aa is unbounded, suppose that(cid:101)h = sup(cid:96)∈[−(cid:96)(s0),∞)(cid:98)Aa((cid:96)) <
∞. Then there is an (cid:101)(cid:96) ∈ R≥0 such that ((cid:101)h,(cid:101)(cid:96)) ∈ ∂R. Thus the a-level set
of A1 lies in R ∩ {h ≤(cid:101)h}, where |(cid:96)| ≤ (cid:101)(cid:96). But there is an (cid:96)† in the domain
of (cid:98)Aa such that (cid:96)† > (cid:101)(cid:96). Then point ((cid:98)Aa((cid:96)†), (cid:96)†) ∈ A

Suppose that a (cid:54)= 4/π. Then the line segments {(h,−(cid:96)(s)) ∈ R s ∈ [−1, 0)}
and {(h, (cid:96)(s)) ∈ R s ∈ [−1, 0)}, which are parallel to the h-axis, each
A1|R∩{(cid:96)=±(cid:96)(s)} is strictly increasing and has range (h(s),∞). Thus the a-
level set of A1 with a > 0 and (cid:54)= 4/π is connected and is the graph of
a piecewise real analytic function, whose graph intersects the h-axis in R
exactly once at (h∗(a), 0).
We now look at the 4/π-level set of A1. Since A1(1, 0) = 4/π, the 4/π-level
(cid:98)A4/π with (cid:98)A(cid:48)
set of A1 is nonempty. It is the graph of a piecewise real analytic function
strictly increasing on R ∩ {(cid:96) > 0}. The graph of (cid:98)A4/π intersects the h-axis
4/π(0) = 0, which is strictly decreasing on R ∩ {(cid:96) < 0} and is
at (1, 0). The domain of (cid:98)A4/π is (−∞,∞) and its range is [1,∞).

The second equality follows from (20). Since (cid:101)T > 0 on R, the action map
A is a local diﬀeomorphism on R \ {(cid:96) = 0}. The map A is one to one
on R, because by point 3 of proposition 2.4 every a-level set of A1 on R
is the graph of a continuous function of (cid:96) on (−∞,∞). Thus the a-level
set of A1 intersects the b -level set of A2 at exactly one point for every
a ≥ 0 and every b. From the fact that A(1, 0) = (4/π, 0) we obtain that
A(R \ {(1, 0)}) = (R≥0 × R) \ {(1, 0)}. The statement about the extension
follows because A extends to a real analytic mapping on R\{0} and because

2.7 The period lattice and its degeneration
−1(h, (cid:96)) when
Here we discuss the period lattice of the 2-torus T 2
(h, (cid:96)) ∈ R and study its degeneration as (h, (cid:96)) converges to a boundary point
of R.

(cid:0)h(s),±(cid:96)(s)(cid:1) = (cid:0)0,±(−s)−1/2(1 − s2)(cid:1) is a diﬀeomorphism of ∂R onto

Ψ : R2 × T 2

h,(cid:96) : ((cid:0)(t1, t2), p(cid:1)

(cid:55)→ ϕH
h,(cid:96) because TpT 2

h,(cid:96) is connected, it follows that the action Ψ is transitive on T 2

For (h, (cid:96)) ∈ R consider the R2-action on the 2-torus T 2
t1 (p)◦ ϕL
(33)
h,(cid:96) = span{XH (p), XL(p)}.
Then Ψ is locally transitive at p ∈ T 2
h,(cid:96). Let
Since T 2
Ph,(cid:96) = {(t1, t2) ∈ R2 Ψ(t1,t2)(p) = p} be the isotropy group of the R2-action
h,(cid:96) = R2/P(cid:96),h. Because R2 is abelian, the isotropy group Ph,(cid:96)
Ψ at p. Then T 2
does not depend on the choice of p. Since Ph,(cid:96) is closed subgroup of the Lie
group R2, it is a Lie group. Suppose that dimPh,(cid:96) ≥ 1. Then Ph,(cid:96) has a one
parameter subgroup, namely, s (cid:55)→ (a s, b s) for some (a, b) ∈ R2 \{(0, 0)}. So

(34)

But XH (p) and XL(p) are linearly independent in TpT 2
h,(cid:96). Hence (34) implies
that a = b = 0, which contradicts the deﬁnition of a and b. Thus Ph,(cid:96) is
a 0-dimensional Lie group and hence is discrete. This shows that Ph,(cid:96) is
a Z-lattice, called the period lattice. By deﬁnition of the functions T and

Θ, we see that the vectors (cid:8)(cid:0)T (h, (cid:96)),−Θ(h, (cid:96))(cid:1)t

,(cid:0)0, 2π(cid:1)t(cid:9) form a Z-basis

of the period lattice Ph,(cid:96). The following calculation serves as a check. Let

which to each (h, (cid:96)) ∈ R assigns the basis of Ph,(cid:96), is locally a real analytic
matrix valued function.
We now look at what happens to Ph,(cid:96) as (h, (cid:96)) ∈ R converges to a point
(h(s), (cid:96)(s)) ∈ ∂R for some s ∈ [−1, 0). Let ph,(cid:96) ∈ T 2
h,(cid:96) and suppose that
ph,(cid:96) converges to ps ∈ EM
In fact ps is a relative
equilibrium of the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld XH on (T S2, ω). In other words,
the integral curve of XH starting at ps is a 1-parameter subgroup of the S1
symmetry generated by the angular momentum Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld XL.
So XH (ps) and XL(ps) are linearly dependent. Thus the isotropy group Ph,(cid:96)
at ph,(cid:96) of the R2-action (33) degenerates to the isotropy group Ps = Ph(s),(cid:96)(s)

Thinking of the 2-torus T 2
Γ(t) associated to the period lattice PΓ(t), we have
a smooth bundle of 2-tori over Γ whose ﬁber over Γ(t) is T 2
Γ(t). The gluing
map of the ﬁbers over the end points Γ(0) and Γ(1) is the linear map of R2
into itself with matrix M. Since M ∈ Gl(2, Z), it maps the lattice (2πZ)2
into itself. Thus M is a diﬀeomorphism of the aﬃne 2-torus T 2 = R2/(2πZ)2
into itself. Recalling that action-angle coordinates identify T 2
h,(cid:96) with T 2, we
see that M is the monodromy map of the 2-torus bundle over Γ. Diﬀerent
choices of the action functions or of the closed curve in the homotopy class
of Γ lead to a 2-torus bundle, which is isomorphic to the one constructed
above. The isomorphism class of the new bundle is determined by the conju-
gacy class of the monodromy map M in Sl(2, Z). Consequently, the spherical
pendulum has no global action-angle coordinates.

3 Quantum spherical pendulum

We begin with a brief review of the elements of geometric quantization, which
we use here. For details see [20]

3.1 Elements of geometric quantization
3.1.1 The prequantization line bundle
The ﬁrst step in geometric quantization of the symplectic manifold (P, ω)
is the construction of a complex line bundle λ : L → P with connection ∇
2π ω, where  is Planck’s constant divided
such that the curvature of ∇ is − 1
by 2π.3 For the spherical pendulum P = T ∗S2, and ω = dθ, where θ is the

Liouville form of the cotangent bundle of the sphere. Hence, L is a trivial
bundle, and we can introduce a global trivializing section σ0 : P → L such
that, for every vector ﬁeld X on P , the covariant derivative of σ0 in direction
X is

∇X σ0 = −i−1θ(X) ⊗ σ0.

(35)
Moreover, we introduce a Hermitian form (cid:104)·,·(cid:105) on L such that (cid:104)σ0, σ0(cid:105) = 1.
The choice of the trivializing section σ0 : P → L gives rise to an identiﬁcation
(36)
Under this identiﬁcation, every section σ of L corresponds to a complex-
valued function ψ on P such that σ = ψσ0.

C × P → L : (z, p) (cid:55)→ zσ0(p).

3.1.2 Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions
Let Γ : [a, b] → P : t (cid:55)→ γ(t) be a curve in P . A section σ of L is covariantly
constant along Γ if ∇ ˙Γ(t)σ = 0 for every t ∈ [a, b], where ˙Γ(t) denotes the
tangent vector of Γ at t. If σ = ψσ0, then

(cid:20) d

(cid:21)
ψ(Γ(t)) − i−1θ( ˙Γ(t))ψ(Γ(t))

∇ ˙Γ(t)σ = ∇ ˙Γ(t)(ψσ) =

Thus, σ is covariantly constant along Γ if and only if ψ(Γ(t)) satisﬁes the
diﬀerential equation

d
dt

ψ(Γ(t)) − i−1θ( ˙Γ(t))ψ(Γ(t)) = 0.
If ψ(Γ(t)) (cid:54)= 0, we divide by ψ(Γ(t)) and integrate to get
(cid:21)

ln ψ(Γ(b)) − ln ψ(Γ(a)) = i−1

3.1.3 Prequantization operators
For each f ∈ C∞(P ), the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld Xf of f generates a local
symplectic form ω. There is a unique lift of Xf to a vector ﬁeld (cid:98)Xf on the
1-parameter group exp tXf of local diﬀeomorphisms of P that preserve the
prequantization line bundle L such that exp t(cid:98)Xf preserves the connection on
L [20]. The prequantization operator Pf associated to f is given by

Pf σ = i d

dt t=0

exp t(cid:98)Xf◦ σ◦ exp(−tXf )

for every σ ∈ S∞(L). Direct computation gives
Pf σ = (−i∇Xf + f )σ.

Theorem 3.2 For every f1, f2 ∈ C∞(P ),

(37)

(38)

[Pf1, Pf2]σ = i P{f1,f2}σ,

(39)
where {f1, f2} = Xf2(f1) = −Xf1(f2) = ω(Xf2, Xf1) is the Poisson bracket
of f1 and f2.
Proof.
[Pf1, Pf2]σ = [(−i∇Xf1

+ f1), (−i∇Xf2
= −2(∇Xf1∇Xf2 − ∇Xf2∇Xf1
)σ − i (Xf1(f2) − Xf2(f1))σ
= −2(∇[Xf1 ,Xf2 ] − i ω(Xf1, Xf2))σ − i (Xf1(f2) − Xf2(f1))σ
= 2∇X{f1,f2}σ + i(ω(Xf1, Xf2) − Xf1(f2) + Xf2(f1))σ

+ f2)]σ

because [Xf1, Xf2] = −X{f1,f2}. Moreover,

ω(Xf1, Xf2) − Xf1(f2) + Xf2(f1) = {f1, f2}.

Therefore,
[Pf1, Pf2] = 2∇X{f1,f2}σ + i{f1, f2}σ = i(−i∇X{f1,f2} + {f1, f2})σ

= i P{f1,f2}σ.

(cid:3)

We refer to the map

P : C

∞(P ) × S

∞(L) → S

as the prequantization map. Equation (39) implies that the map f (cid:55)→ 1

is a representation of the Poisson algebra of C∞(P ) on the space S∞(L),
which we call the prequantization representation.

3.1.4 Polarization
In Dirac’s formulation of quantum mechanics, the space of quantum states of
the spherical pendulum consists of functions on the spectrum of the complete
set of commuting observables. This idea can be identiﬁed with the modern
theory of representations of C∗ algebras.
In the framework of geometric
quantization, it gave rise to the notion of polarization of (P, ω), which is
given by a complex involutive Lagrangian distribution F on the phase space
P . For P = T ∗S2, the choice of F determines the representation of the
quantum theory of the spherical pendulum.

Let F be a complex involutive Lagrangian distribution F on P . In other
words, F is a complex distribution on P such that dimC F = 2n, where
dim P = 2n. Moreover, ω(u, v) = 0 for every pair of vectors u, v ∈ F attached
at the same point in P . In the following we also allow for polarizations with
singularities, that is, smooth distributions that are Lagrangian on an open
dense subset of P. Quantization in the F -representation leads to the space
of quantum states

SF (L) = {σ : P → L | ∇uσ = 0 for each u ∈ F}.

(40)
In other words, SF (L) is the space of sections of L that are covariantly
constant along F .
Deﬁnition 3.1 The space C∞
F (P ) of directly quantizable functions in terms
of a polarization F consists of functions f ∈ C∞(P ) such that, the ﬂow of
the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld Xf of f preserves the polarization F .
For each f ∈ C∞(P ), the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld Xf of f lifts to a
unique vector ﬁeld on the prequantization line bundle that preserves the
connection. Hence, if f ∈ C∞
F (P ), it follows that Pf action leaves SF (L)
invariant.
Deﬁnition 3.2 Direct quantization in the F -representation is given by re-
stricting the domain of the prequantization map to C∞
F (P ) × SF (L) and its
codomain to SF (L). In other words,

(41)

Q : C

∞
F (P ) × SF (L) → SF (L) : (f, σ) (cid:55)−→ Qf σ ≡ Pf σ.

Quantization in the F -representation of functions that are not in C∞
requires additional assumptions.
Deﬁnition 3.3 A polarization of (P, ω) is real, if it is a complexiﬁcation of
a (real) involutive Lagrangian distribution. In other words,

F (P )

F = D ⊗ C,

27

(42)

where D is an involutive Lagrangian distribution on P .
In the following we assume
Condition D is locally spanned by Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds.
This condition allows for a generalization to polarizations with singularity.

3.2 Schrödinger quantization
Schrödinger quantization of the spherical pendulum corresponds to the real
polarization tangent to ﬁbres of the cotangent bundle projection π : T ∗S2 →
S2. In other words, the Schrödinger polarization is ker T π ⊗ C, where

ker T π = {u ∈ T (T

S2) | T π(u) = 0}.

∗

For every p ∈ T ∗S2 and w ∈ Tp(T ∗S2), the evaluation of the Liouville form
θ on w equals the evaluation of p on T π(w), that is, θ(w) = p(T π(w)).
Hence, θ vanishes on ker T π, which implies that the extension of θ to the
complexiﬁcation of ker T π vanishes. Equation (35) implies that the trivializ-
ing section σ0 of L is covariantly constant along ker T π. Thus, every section
σ of L that is covariantly constant along ker T π is of the form σ = ψσ0,
where ψ is a complex-valued function on T ∗S2 that is constant along ker T π.
However, functions on T ∗S2 that are constant along ker T π are pull-backs
by π : T ∗S2 → S2 of functions on S2. Thus,
∗Ψ)σ0 | Ψ ∈ C

(43)
Equation (43) shows that we may identify the space Sker T π(L) of sections
of L that are covariantly constant along ker T π with the space of smooth
complex-valued functions on S2.
ker T π(T ∗S2) of functions on T ∗S2 that are directly quanti-
zable in terms of the Schrödinger polarization ker T π consists of functions
such that their Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds preserve ker T π. It contains pull-
backs by π of smooth functions on S2. Moreover, for every vector ﬁeld X
on S2, its natural extension of ˇX to T ∗S2 is a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld with
Hamiltonian θ( ˇX) and it preserves ker T π. It can be easily veriﬁed that

tion.
product of quantum states (π∗Ψ1)σ0 and (π∗Ψ2)σ0 is given by

An additional assumption of the Schrödinger theory is that the scalar

(Ψ1 | Ψ2) =

S2

Ψ1Ψ2 dµ,

(47)

where dµ is the area form of S2. The demand that quantum observables
are given by self-adjoint operators, requires that the operators in equation
(46) should be symmetrized. If the scalar product is introduced in geometric
quantization in terms of half-forms, then the operators corresponding to
equation (46) are symmetric [20].

3.3 Bohr-Sommerfeld spectrum
Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization corresponds to the polarization ker TEM⊗C
tangent to the ﬁbres of the energy-momentum map EM : T ∗S2 → R2. The
range of the energy momentum map is stratiﬁed, with open dense stratum
given by the set R of regular values. There are two one dimensional strata B+
and B− corresponding to the minimum of energy for a positive or negative
value of the angular momentum, respectively, and two singular points (−1, 0)
and (1, 0).
As before, quantum states are sections of the prequantization line bun-
dle that are covariantly constant along the polarization. Since ﬁbres of the
energy momentum map are compact, values (h, (cid:96)l) of the energy and the an-
gular momentum that are in supports of sections of L, which are covariantly
constant along the polarization ker TEM ⊗ C, are restricted by the Bohr-
Sommerfeld conditions; see Theorem 3.1.2. These conditions can be easily

29

described in terms of the action variables A1, A2, where A1 is a continuous
function of the Hamiltonian H and the angular momentum L, and A2 = L,
see proposition 2.4. Recall that A1 is a continuous function on T ∗S2. More-
over, (A1)|EM−1(1,0) = 4/π, (A1)|EM−1(−1,0) = 0, and (A1)|EM−1(B±) = 0.
In order to avoid excessive notation, for (h, (cid:96)) in the range of EM, we
write A1(h, (cid:96)) for the value at (h, (cid:96)) of the push-forward of A1 by the energy
A1. For each ﬁxed (cid:96) (cid:54)= 0,
momentum map EM. In other words, A1 = EM
the function h (cid:55)−→ A1(h, (cid:96)), which is deﬁned on [h(cid:96),∞), where h(cid:96) is the
minimum of the Hamiltonian H on the level set L = (cid:96), is strictly increasing
and has range [0,∞). Therefore, for every a ≥ 0, the equation A1(h, (cid:96)) = a
has a unique solution h(cid:96)(a) for h ∈ [h(cid:96),∞) in terms of a and (cid:96), see point 2
of proposition 2.4.
Deﬁnition 3.4 The Bohr-Sommerfeld energy-momentum spectrum of the
quantum spherical pendulum is the set S of (h, (cid:96)) in the image of EM that
satisfy the Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions

For (h, (cid:96)) ∈ B±, the ﬁbre EM

A1(h, (cid:96)) = n and A2(h, (cid:96)) = (cid:96) = m

If (h, (cid:96)) ∈ R, that is, (h, (cid:96)) is a regular value in the image of EM, then
(49)
for some integers n > 0 and m. Hence, A1(h, m) = n, and we can express
the energy h in terms of n and m and write h = h(n, m).
−1(h, (cid:96)) is a 1-torus T1
In this case
h,(cid:96).
h,(cid:96) give (cid:96) = m,
A1 = 0 and the Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions applied to T1
where m ∈ Z. In this case, we can use equation A1(h, m) = 0 to express
the energy h in terms of n = 0 and m > 0 and write h = h(0, m).
The ﬁbre of the energy momentum map over the singular point (−1, 0) is
−1(−1, 0) = (−1, 0), and the Bohr-Sommerfeld
a zero-dimensional torus, EM
conditions are satisﬁed with n = 0 and m = 0. Thus, we may write h(0, 0) =
−1.
It remains to consider the singular point (1, 0). Since A1(1, 0) = 4/π
and A2(1, 0) = 0, equation (49) gives 4/π = n, which implies that Planck’s
constant 2π = 8/n. This is a very strong condition on Planck’s constant,
unlikely to be satisﬁed in physics. Therefore, we assume that the Bohr-
Sommerfeld conditions are not satisﬁed by the unstable equilibrium point
(1, 0).

3.4 Bohr-Sommerfeld-Heisenberg quantization
3.4.1 Shifting operators
The weakness of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory is that it does not provide
operators corresponding to transitions between diﬀerent states. Of course,
there are such operators acting on H. Since the Bohr-Sommerfeld basis B in
H has a lattice structure given by equation (51), there exist shifting operators
a1 and a2 on H such that

3.4.2 Quantization of angles
We want to interpret the shifting operators as a1 and a2 as quantum oper-
ators corresponding to functions f1 and f2 on the phase space T ∗S2 of the
spherical pendulum. In other words, we want to make an identiﬁcation

a1 = Qf1 and a2 = Qf2.

(56)

Since the shifting operators are not self-adjoint, we cannot expect functions
f1 and f2 to be real-valued. This means that we have to extend the Dirac
quantization condition

[Qf1, Qf2] = i Q{f1,f2}

(57)

to complex-valued functions.

Recall, that the action A1 is smooth on the complement EM

for j, k = 1, 2.
Proof. By deﬁnition, the angle action variables satisfy the Poisson commu-
tation relations

{Aj, Ak} = 0, {ϕj, ϕk} = 0 and {Aj, ϕk} = −δjk,

where j, k = 1, 2. Hence,

{Aj, e−iϕk} = −ie−iϕk{Aj, ϕk} = ie−iϕk δjk,

as required.

(cid:3)
Comparing equations (52) and (58) we see that that the identiﬁcation
(56) satisﬁes the Dirac quantization condition (57) for f1 = e−iϕ1 and f2 =
−1(R) \ L−1(0) of T ∗S2, where R is the
e−iϕ2 in the open dense subset EM
regular stratum of the range of the energy momentum map EM : T ∗S2 →
R2. In other words, for every (n, m) ∈ Z2 with n > 0 and m (cid:54)= 0, we may
set
(59)
Since e−iϕ1 and e−iϕ2 are well deﬁned on R ∩ L−1(0), we can extend the

a1σn,m = Qe−iϕ1 σn,m and a2σn,m = Qe−iϕ2 σn,m.

identiﬁcation (59) to R ∩ L−1(0) and write

a1σn,0 = Qe−iϕ1 σn,0 and a2σn,0 = Qe−iϕ2 σn,0,

(60)
−1(R)\L−1(0), the Poisson brackets involving
where n > 0. However, on EM
A1 are not deﬁned because dA1 is not deﬁned there. Hence, the right hand
side of equation (57) is not independently deﬁned. This is a manifestation
of the presence of monodromy in the spherical pendulum, which will be
discussed in Section 3.4.4.

3.4.3 Boundary conditions
It remains to extend operators Qe−iϕ1 and Qe−iϕ2 to quantum states σ0,m
−1(R). This is analogous to extending
supported on the boundary of EM
Schrödinger quantization to the cotangent bundle of a manifold with bound-
ary and corners.

35

The angle functions are not globally deﬁned. In particular, the functions
e−iϕ1 and e−iϕ2 are not deﬁned at the singular points (0,−1) and (0, 1).
Moreover, e−iϕ1 is not deﬁned when A1 = 0.
In order to extend e−iϕ1 to a globally deﬁned function, we choose a
smooth function χ1(h, l) on R = imageEM, which is identically 1 on a neigh-
bourhood of R ∩ S in R, where S is the Bohr-Sommerfeld energy spectrum
(50), and vanishes to inﬁnite order on the boundary ∂R of R. The product
f1 = χ1(L, H)e−iϕ1 is a globally deﬁned function on T ∗S2 that vanishes to
inﬁnite order on EM

−1(∂R) and satisﬁes the Poisson bracket relations
{Aj, f1} = {Aj, χ1(L, H)e−iϕ1} = −iχ1(L, H)e−iϕ1{Aj, ϕ1} = f1δj1

for j = 1, 2. Since f1 = χ1(L, H)e−iϕ1 vanishes to inﬁnite order on ∂R ∩ S
and derivatives of χ1 vanish to inﬁnite order on S, it follows that we can
make the identiﬁcation

Qf1σn,m = Qχ1e−iϕ1 σn,m = a1σn,m

(61)
for all (n, m) ∈ Z2 with n > 0 and m (cid:54)= 0. On the other hand, f1 =
χ1(L, H)e−iϕ1 vanishes to inﬁnite order on ∂R ∩ S. Hence, we may set

Qf1σ0,m = 0 = a1σ0,m

(62)

This identiﬁcation is independent of the choice of χ1 satisfying the required
conditions. In order to keep the notation simple, in the following we omit
χ1 and write

Qe−iϕ1 σn,m = a1σn,m

The function e−iϕ2 is deﬁned on EM

(63)
for all (n, m) ∈ Z2 with n ≥ 0 and m (cid:54)= 0. It remains to consider the action
of
−1(∂R\{(−1, 0), (1, 0)}. As before,
we can extend e−iϕ2 to the whole of T ∗S2 by multiplying e−iϕ2 by an appro-
priate function χ2 of H and L. By assumption (1, 0) /∈ S, so vanishing of χ2
at (1, 0) does not aﬀect the identiﬁcation of a2 with Qe−iϕ2 . However, the
point (−1, 0) ∈ S, corresponding to (n, m) = (0, 0), is a corner of the range
−1(−1, 0). Therefore, the identiﬁcalion
of EM and ϕ2 is not deﬁned on EM
(64)

Qe−iϕ2 σ0,0 = a2σ0,−1

is an essential extension of the deﬁnition of Qe−iϕ2 , which does not follow
from the Dirac quantization conditions. Making this identiﬁcation, we write

Qe−iϕ2 σn,m = a2σn,m

(65)

36

for all (n, m) ∈ Z2 with n ≥ 0.
Having identiﬁed shifting operators a1 and a2 with quantizations of e−iϕ1
†
and e−iϕ2, respectively, we observe that the adjoint operators a
k may be
identiﬁed with quantization of eiϕk. In other words,

†
a
k = Qeiϕk

(66)
for k = 1, 2. Moreover, as in the Schrödinger theory, to a function f on T ∗S2,
which can be expressed as a polynomial in A1, A2, e−iϕ1 and e−iϕ2, we can
assign the corresponding polynomial in QA1, QA2, Qe−iϕ1 , and Qe−iϕ2 . In
this case, the result depends on the ordering of the factors.

3.5 Quantum monodromy
In this subsection we will discuss

1. the deﬁnition of quantum monodromy;
2. show that the quantum spherical pendulum has quantum

monodromy;

3. read oﬀ the classical monodromy of the spherical pendulum
from the joint spectrum of its Bohr-Sommerfeld-Heisenberg
quantization.

We begin by deﬁning quantum monodromy. Our discussion leans heavily
on the treatment of Vu Ngoc [22]. Let B be an open 2-disk in R2, which
is contained in R and is centered at c ∈ R. The intersection B ∩ S of the
Bohr-Sommerfeld spectrum S with B is a local lattice, because the image
of B ∩ S under the homeomorphism given by the action map A (32) is the
S. Let (cid:83)
intersection of the open subset A(B) with the standard lattice 2π Z2. We
call the pair (B,A|B) a local chart at c for the Bohr-Sommerfeld spectrum
α∈I Bα be an open covering of R by 2-disks each centered at cα.
Suppose that (Bα,A|Bα) and (Bβ,A|Bβ ) are local charts for S and that
cα ∈ Bα ∩ Bβ. From the construction of action angle coordinates in section
Aαβ : Bα ∩ Bβ ⊆ R → Sl(2, Z) : (h, (cid:96)) (cid:55)−→ A|Bβ (h, (cid:96))) ◦(cid:0)
2.4, it follows that the chart transition map
(cid:121)πα

is locally constant. Let τ : L → R be the Z2-bundle over R with local
trivialization given by the top row of the commutative diagram

The isomorphism class4 of the bundle L is the quantum monodromy of the
Bohr-Sommerfeld spectrum S ⊆ R.
Action-angle coordinates provide a local trivialization of the bundle π :
−1(R) → R. From their construction it follows that the bundle L → R
EM
is isomorphic to the bundle P → R of period lattices. But the bundle P is
not trivial, since the spherical pendulum has classical monodromy. Thus the
Z2-lattice bundle L is not trivial. In other words, the quantum monodromy
of the spherical pendulum is nontrivial.
We now give a geometric procedure for determining the quantum mon-
odromy of the Bohr-Sommerfeld spectrum S. Consider the neighboring
quantum numbers

(n, m), (n + 1, m), (n + 1, m + 1), and (n, m + 1).

α∈I Bα of R, since AαβAβα = id and AαβAβγAγα = id, for every α, β, and γ ∈ I.
The Čech cohomology class [M ], associated to the Čech cocycle M, corresponds to the
isomorphism class of the bundle L. See [14, p.40–41].

spectral values corresponding to the edge joining (n, m) to (n + 1, m) and

4 Concluding remarks

• We have extended the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization of the spher-
ical pendulum to a full quantum theory, which we call the Bohr-
Sommerfeld-Heisenberg (BSH) quantization. Our approach leads to a
matrix formulation of Born, Jordan and Heisenberg [4], [5] with quan-
tum operators expressed as matrices in the Bohr-Sommerfeld basis.
According to Mehra and Rechenberg [15, p.265] the connection be-
tween quantum mechanics and the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory of multi-
ply periodic systems “seems to have been lost completely in the matrix
approach” until it was re-established by Wentzel [24].
• We had an advantage of being able to rely on the guiding principle of
geometric quantization for an open dense subset of the phase space in
which all our constructions were regular. In treating nowhere dense
sets of singular points, we followed Dirac’s Principles of Quantum Me-
chanics [11]
• In our presentation, we have included the geometric quantization set-
ting of the Schrödinger theory. It shows that the main diﬀerence be-
tween the BSH theory and the Schrodinger theory is the choice of po-
larization. For a completely integrable system, the energy momentum
map is regular in an open dense subset of the phase space. Hence in the
BSH quantization, we have to deal with polarization with singularities
on the boundary of that set. This leads to diﬃculties analogous to
those that appear in formulating the Schrodinger theory on a singular
space.

BSH quantization, presented here, the representation space H depends
on  because it is deﬁned in terms of a basis B consisting eigensec-
tions supported on ﬁbres of the energy-momentum map that satisfy the
Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions. For every ﬁbre of the energy-momentum
map, there exists a value of , treated as a parameter, for which this
ﬁbre satisﬁes Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions.
