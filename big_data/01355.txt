We analyze minimizers of the Lawrence-Doniach energy for three-dimensional highly anisotropic
superconductors with layered structure. For such a superconductor occupying a bounded gen-
eralized cylinder in R3 with equally spaced parallel layers, we assume an applied magnetic ﬁeld
that is perpendicular to the layers with intensity hex ∼ | ln ǫ| as ǫ → 0, where ǫ is the reciprocal
of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter. We prove compactness results for various physical quantities
of energy minimizers, and derive a Gamma-limit of the Lawrence-Doniach energy as ǫ and the
interlayer distance s tend to zero, under the additional assumption that the layers are weakly
coupled (i.e., s ≫ ǫ).

Introduction

This paper is devoted to the analysis of the Lawrence-Doniach model (with energy given by (1.1)) for
three-dimensional highly anisotropic superconductors with layered structure. Such discrete structure
is common in high temperature superconductors (e.g., the cuprates). Because of the discrete layered
structure, these superconductors exhibit very diﬀerent material properties than isotropic supercon-
ductors, which can be well described by the celebrated Ginzburg-Landau model. (See the survey [15]
for a physical discussion on layered superconductors.) The Lawrence-Doniach model was proposed
by Lawrence and Doniach [18] in 1971 as an alternative model to account for the anisotropy in lay-
ered superconductors. Unlike the Ginzburg-Landau model, which describes a superconductor as a
continuous three-dimensional solid, the Lawrence-Doniach model treats the superconducting material
as a stack of parallel superconducting layers with nonlinear Josephson coupling between them. It is
generally considered a more complete theory for layered superconductors than other models (e.g., the
anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau model).

1.1 The energy functional

We ﬁrst recall the two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau energy with magnetic ﬁelds. Let Ω ⊂ R2 be a
bounded simply connected smooth domain. Then the two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau energy with
magnetic ﬁelds is given by

Fǫ(u, A) =

Here the ﬁrst unknown u : Ω → C is the complex valued order parameter, whose modulus, |u(x)|,
represents the density of superconducting electron pairs at the point x. For a minimizer of Fǫ,
|u(x)| ∼ 1 corresponds to a superconducting state at x, whereas |u(x)| = 0 corresponds to a normal
(nonsuperconducting) state at x. The second unknown A = (A1, A2) : Ω → R2 is the magnetic
potential, whose two-dimensional curl, curlA = ∂1A2 − ∂2A1, represents the induced magnetic ﬁeld.
The parameter ǫ > 0 is the reciprocal of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter κ, and hex > 0 represents the
strength of the applied magnetic ﬁeld. We set ∇Au = ∇u − ıAu on Ω. The above energy Fǫ represents
the free energy of a cross-section of an inﬁnitely long cylinder shaped superconductor subject to an
applied magnetic ﬁeld of intensity hex that is perpendicular to the cross-section.

In this paper, we focus on the Lawrence-Doniach model. For some ﬁxed L > 0 and a bounded
simply connected smooth domain Ω ⊂ R2, we denote D = Ω × (0, L), which is the bounded open
cylinder in R3 with cross-section Ω and height L. We consider a layered superconductor occupying
D with N + 1 equally spaced layers of material occupying Ωn = Ω × {ns}, where s = L
N is the
interlayer distance. Assuming an applied magnetic ﬁeld hex~e3 which is perpendicular to the layers,
the Lawrence-Doniach energy is given by

loc(R3; R3) : (∇ × ~C) − hex~e3 ∈ L2(R3; R3)}.

Similar to the Ginzburg-Landau energy, the ﬁrst unknown un : Ω → C is the complex valued order
parameter on the nth layer, and the second unknown ~A = (A1, A2, A3) : R3 → R3 is the magnetic
potential, whose three-dimensional curl, ∇ × ~A = (∂2A3 − ∂3A2, ∂3A1 − ∂1A3, ∂1A2 − ∂2A1), is the
induced magnetic ﬁeld. The material parameter λ > 0 represents the Josephson penetration depth,
which is assumed to be ﬁxed in this study. Throughout, we use (ˆ·) to denote two-dimensional vectors
and operators. For example, we denote ˆx = (x1, x2), ˆ∇ = (∂1, ∂2), ˆA = (A1, A2) and ˆAn(ˆx) =
(A1(ˆx, ns), A2(ˆx, ns)), the trace of ˆA on the nth layer.

For the above models with magnetic ﬁelds, the behavior of energy minimizers is largely determined
by the values of hex versus ǫ. Namely, there are two critical values of hex, denoted by Hc1 ∼ | ln ǫ|
and Hc3 ∼ 1
ǫ2 , at which the superconductor undergoes phase transitions from the superconducting
state to the mixed state (coexistence of superconducting and normal states), and from the mixed
state to the normal state, respectively. One of the central questions is to understand the vortex
structure for minimizers with the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld in diﬀerent regimes. (A vortex is
an isolated zero of the order parameter u, around which u has a nonzero winding number, called
the degree of the vortex.) For the underlying two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau energy, the behavior
of energy minimizers and their vortex structure in an applied magnetic ﬁeld with modulus hex in
diﬀerent regimes (e.g., hex ∼ | ln ǫ|, | ln ǫ| ≪ hex ≪ ǫ−2, or hex ≥ C
ǫ2 ) are now well understood. (See
the book [21] and the references therein, and also [17] and [13].) Recently, Γ-convergence results for
the three-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model in diﬀerent energy regimes were obtained by Baldo et
al.
[6]. For the Lawrence-Doniach energy, an analysis of minimizers for hex in the ﬁrst two regimes

2

has been done by Alama et al. [1] under certain periodicity assumptions. They also studied the cases
when the magnetic ﬁelds are parallel to the layers or oblique in [1] and [2]. Without the additional
periodicity assumptions, Bauman and the author [9] proved an asymptotic formula for the minimum
Lawrence-Doniach energy with | ln ǫ| ≪ hex ≪ ǫ−2 in the limiting case as (ǫ, s) → (0, 0), and obtained
vortex structure information in this case. In the last regime, hex ≥ C
ǫ2 , it was shown by Bauman-Ko [8]
that if C is suﬃciently large, all minimizers of the Lawrence-Doniach energy are in the normal phase.
A similar result is known for the two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau energy. (See [13].) The goal of
this paper is to investigate the limiting behavior of the Lawrence-Doniach energy with the intensity
of the magnetic ﬁeld in the regime hex ∼ | ln ǫ| without the additional periodicity assumptions.

1.2 Statement of the main results

To state our main results, let us introduce some notations. Following notations in [16], for a function
u ∈ H 1(Ω; C), we deﬁne the current j(u) and the Jacobian J(u) to be

j(u) = (ıu, ˆ∇u),

J(u) =

1
2

curlj(u),

respectively. Here (ıu, ˆ∇u) is a real vector in R2 with components (ıu, ∂ju) for j = 1, 2, where
(a + ıb, c + ıd) = ac + bd for two complex numbers a + ıb and c + ıd. For the two-dimensional Ginzburg-
Landau energy, the Jacobian carries important topological information of vortices (e.g., degree and
n=0, ~A) ∈ [H 1(Ω; C)]N +1 × E, we deﬁne the discrete version of
location). For a conﬁguration ({un}N

(1.8)

Given some constant h0 ≥ 0, we deﬁne spaces E0 and K0 that are parallel to E and K. More precisely,
let

E0 := { ~C ∈ H 1

loc(R3; R3) : (∇ × ~C) − h0~e3 ∈ L2(R3; R3)},

and

K0 := { ~C ∈ E0 : ∇ · ~C = 0 and ~C − h0~a ∈ ˇH 1(R3; R3) ∩ L6(R3; R3)}.

(1.9)

Let M(D) be the space of ﬁnite Radon measures. Also we deﬁne the space

For a pair (v, ~A) ∈ L2(D; R2) × E0, we deﬁne the energy functional

(1.16)

Note that the regime for hex under consideration is a lot more subtle than the higher regime studied
in [9], since for the regime hex ∼ | ln ǫ|, the superconductor undergoes a phase transition from the
superconducting state to the mixed state. Theorem 1 generalizes a result of Alama et al. [1], in which
the Lawrence-Doniach energy is minimized among conﬁgurations whose gauge-invariant quantities are
periodic with respect to a given parallelepiped. In that case, the periodicity assumptions simplify the
problem signiﬁcantly. Namely, it was proved that, for a minimizer of the gauge periodic problem, the
order parameters un are all equal and A3 is identically zero. In particular, the Josephson coupling

vanishes. As a result, the Lawrence-Doniach energy reduces to a sum of copies of the two-dimensional
Ginzburg-Landau energies on the layers. In our more general case without the periodicity assumptions,
such dimension reduction techniques do not work.

Theorem 1 also extends the Γ-convergence results on the two-dimensional (see [19] and [17]) and
three-dimensional (see [6]) Ginzburg-Landau models to the Lawrence-Doniach model. Our results are
parallel to those on the former. Here, the Γ-limit Gh0 deﬁned in (1.11) diﬀers from those for the

5

Ginzburg-Landau models, in that Gh0 includes both two-dimensional (terms involving v) and three-
dimensional (terms involving ~A) functions. In particular, the limiting Jacobian, curlv, is a scalar valued
measure and does not include the x3 derivative of v. Therefore, our problem has features of both
the two-dimensional and three-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau models. Nevertheless, the Lawrence-
Doniach model shares more features with the three-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau model. Indeed, for
the Ginzburg-Landau models with magnetic ﬁelds in the regime considered here, through a convex
duality argument, one can rewrite the minimization of the limiting energy functional in the form
of a constrained minimization problem of obstacle type (see [19], [17] and [7]). A major diﬀerence
between the two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases is that, in the latter case, the obstacle
becomes nonlocal. This makes the analysis of the three-dimensional obstacle type problem much
more challenging than its two-dimensional counterpart. (See [7] for more details.) Our problem of
minimization of the limiting functional Gh0 also corresponds to a nonlocal obstacle problem. A recent
work of Athavale et al.
[5] includes detailed discussions on the minimization of energy functionals
involving total variation measures.

Our Γ-convergence in Theorem 1 relies on the extra assumption (1.14), which makes the Lawrence-
Doniach model in the extremely discrete scenario. Note that this assumption is only used to guarantee
that the energy from the Josephson coupling term (1.17) with a scaling factor | ln ǫ|2 converges to zero
in the limit. In some sense, the assumption (1.14) imposes a weak coupling condition between adjacent
layers in the Lawrence-Doniach model. Nevertheless, the regime under consideration is an interesting
regime. In fact, when s ≪ ǫ, it is expected that the Lawrence-Doniach model converges, in some
sense, to an anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau model (see [10] and [8]), which is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from the standard Ginzburg-Landau model in certain aspects. The assumption (1.14) is a key factor
that leads to the mixture of two-dimensional and three-dimensional terms in the limiting functional
Gh0 , and consequently, that makes the problem more diﬀerent from the three-dimensional Ginzburg-
Landau model. It is not clear to the author whether or not the limiting functional Gh0 derived in
Theorem 1 also serves as the Γ-limit of Gǫ,s

LD with ǫ and s in other regimes, especially when s ≪ ǫ.

The proof of the compactness and lower bound in Theorem 1 uses a standard slicing argument
that has been used by Jerrard-Soner [16] and Sandier-Serfaty [20] for the Ginzburg-Landau functional
in higher dimensions. A key point is to use small balls to cover the Jacobian in order to separate the
energy contribution of the Jacobian from that of the other terms (see Lemma 3.4).

The proof of the upper bound is a lot more involved. In Section 4, we construct the order param-
eters {un} on the layers. Essentially, on each layer, we follow the construction of test functions for
the two-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau energy used in [19] and [17]. Here an extra level of subtlety
comes from the limiting process as the interlayer distance s approaches zero, which creates some extra
technical diﬃculties. In Section 5, we construct the magnetic potential ~A by slightly modifying that
of the minimizer of the limiting functional Gh0.

As a consequence of Theorem 1, we have the following

Corollary 1. Assume limǫ→0
Gǫ,s
LD in [H 1(Ω; C)]N +1 × K. Under the assumption (1.14), up to a subsequence, we have

as (ǫ, s) → (0, 0), where χD is the characteristic function of the domain D.

The above Corollary 1 gives more compactness for the magnetic potential ~A than has been obtained

in Theorem 1. Note that ∇×(cid:16)∇ × ~A(cid:17) is a sum of singular measures supported on the layers, as can be

seen from the Euler-Langrange equations (1.2). As a result, the magnetic potential has less regularity
than the order parameters. A major challenge in the analysis of the Lawrence-Doniach model comes

6

from the discrete structure of the problem. In the limit as the interlayer distance s tends to zero,
we need to show compactness for discrete quantities in the form of the discrete current and Jacobian
deﬁned in (1.7). Such compactness results are more diﬃcult to establish for the magnetic potential
~A for the reason mentioned above. It is crucial to understand how the vector ﬁeld ~A relates to its
traces in this particular context. From the Euler-Lagrange equations (1.2), one can see that A1 and
A2 satisfy elliptic equations with singular measure data supported on the layers. Bauman-Ko [8] made
a connection between this problem and the single layer potential theory, and proved representation
formulas for A1 and A2 using sum of single layer potentials deﬁned on the layers. Based on their
results, in [9], we proved an a priori estimate (see Theorem 3.1) which turns out to be very useful
for the analysis of the Lawrence-Doniach model. In particular, this estimate gives compactness for
discrete quantities involving the traces ˆAn as s goes to zero. A continuous analog of Theorem 3.1 is
proved in Lemma 5.2.

1.3 Outline of the paper

in Section 2, we provide some preliminaries that are needed in
This paper is organized as follows:
later sections. The proof of Theorem 1 constitutes the major part of this paper, and is included in
Sections 3 through 6. We conclude Section 6 with the proof of Corollary 1. Finally, the last section
is an appendix, which contains some approximation and extension results for the space V .

2 Preliminaries

In this section, we provide some preliminary results that are needed for later sections. First we prove
existence of minimizers of the limiting functional Gh0 deﬁned in (1.11). The proof is standard and
follows from the direct method in the calculus of variations. However, since the functional Gh0 contains
a mixture of 2D and 3D functions, we believe that it is worth including a proof here.

Proposition 2.1. The minimum of Gh0 over V × E0 and over V × K0 is achieved. Moreover, we
have

min
V ×E0

Gh0 = min
V ×K0

Gh0 .

Proof. Given (v, ~A) ∈ V × E0, using a similar argument as in Lemma 2.1 of [8], there exists a function
g ∈ H 2

loc(R3) such that ~A + ∇g ∈ K0. By simple calculations, one can check that

Gh0 (v + ˆ∇g, ~A + ∇g) = Gh0 (v, ~A),

where recall that ˆ∇ is the gradient operator with respect to x1 and x2. Therefore, it suﬃces to show
that the minimum of Gh0 is achieved by some (v0, ~A0) ∈ V × K0.

Let {(vk, ~Ak)} ⊂ V × K0 be a minimizing sequence of Gh0 . By the deﬁnition of the space K0
2 (−x2, x1, 0). Therefore, we have

in (1.9), we have ∇ · ~Ak = 0. Recall that we have ﬁxed ~a(x) = 1
∇ · ( ~Ak − h0~a) = 0. By (1.6), we have

k ~Ak − h0~ak2

dx.

ˇH1(R3;R3) =ZR3(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∇ × ~Ak − h0~e3(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Since {Gh0(vk, ~Ak)} is a bounded sequence, it follows that { ~Ak − h0~a} forms a bounded sequence in
ˇH 1(R3; R3), and, by (1.5), in L6(R3; R3). Consequently, there exists ~A0 such that ~A0 − h0~a ∈ ˇH 1 ∩ L6
and, upon extraction,

~Ak − h0~a ⇀ ~A0 − h0~a

in ˇH 1(R3; R3) and in L6(R3; R3).

(2.1)

7

(Here we do not distinguish between the original sequence and its convergent subsequences.) It is
then clear that ∇ · ( ~A0 − h0~a) = 0. Therefore we have ~A0 ∈ K0. By compact Sobolev embedding, we
have, upon another extraction,

~Ak → ~A0

(2.2)
for 1 ≤ q < 6, from which we deduce that { ˆAk} is bounded in L2(D; R2). This along with the
boundedness of {vk − ˆAk} in L2(D; R2) implies that {vk} is bounded in L2(D; R2). So there exists
v0 ∈ L2(D; R2) such that, upon extraction,

in Lq(D; R3)

vk ⇀ v0

in L2(D; R2).

(2.3)

Now it only remains to show that curlv0 is a ﬁnite Radon measure. To this end, we take a test function
ϕ ∈ C1

c (D). It follows from (2.3) and an integration by parts that

Putting (2.1)-(2.4) together, and using lower semicontinuity, we conclude that

Hence, (v0, ~A0) ∈ V × K0 is a minimizer of Gh0 .

Our next result concerns the density of C∞(D; R2) in the space V (deﬁned in (1.10)) with respect

to a norm that is similar to that on the space of BV functions. More precisely, we have

The above proposition is needed in Section 4. Such results might be well-known to experts.
However, the author did not ﬁnd a proof in the literature. For the sake of completion, we include a
proof in the last section as an appendix. Essentially, the space V carries a structure that is analogous
to that on the space BV. We adapt standard approximation and extension techniques for BV functions
to prove Proposition 2.2.

where we denote

the simpliﬁed 2D Ginzburg-Landau energy without magnetic ﬁeld. A similar decomposition as in
(3.1) was used for the Ginzburg-Landau energy. (See [17] and [6].) The decomposition (3.1) allows us
to separate the energy of the magnetic terms from the 2D Ginzburg-Landau energies on the layers.

3.1 An a priori estimate

For the estimates of the magnetic terms, a major obstacle is that the magnetic potential ~A appears
both as a global 3D vector ﬁeld and as 2D vector ﬁelds in the form of its traces ˆAn on the layers.
In [9], we proved the following a priori estimate, which turns out to be crucial in the analysis of the
Lawrence-Doniach energy in the limit as the interlayer distance s tends to zero.

Theorem 3.1 (Bauman-P. [9]). Assume that hex > 0, ǫ > 0 and ({un}N
is a minimizer of Gǫ,s

LD. We have

for all ǫ and s suﬃciently small, where 0 < α < 1 and C are constants independent of ǫ and s.

Note that the corresponding theorem in [9] does not include the estimate for ˆA − ˆAn. However, this
can be obtained by slightly modifying the proof of the estimate in [9] for ˆ∇( ˆA − ˆAn) without any
diﬃculty.

3.2 The Jacobian estimate

For the 2D Ginzburg-Landau energies on the layers, a key step in the analysis is to separate the
energy from the Jacobian (deﬁned in (1.7)) by showing that its energy is concentrated in small regions
with total measure tending to zero. Such Jacobian estimates were proved for the Ginzburg-Landau
energy in [16] and [20] (see also [3]). The proof requires suitable upper bound on the 2D Ginzburg-
Landau energy. In Lemma 3.2, using an upper bound on the Lawrence-Doniach energy (see (3.3))
and Theorem 3.1, we are able to show that the desired upper bound on the 2D Ginzburg-Landau
energy holds on most of the layers. Then following a standard slicing argument that was used in [16]
and [20], we are able to prove a Jacobian estimate for the Lawrence-Doniach energy in Lemma 3.4 (in
particular, (3.15)).

The above Lemma 3.2 enables us to prove a Jacobian estimate for the Lawrence-Doniach energy.
The proof is very similar to that for the higher dimensional Ginzburg-Landau energy in [16] and [20].
Here we provide the proof for the convenience of the reader. We ﬁrst recall a covering result from [20]
which is convenient for our purposes. As in [20], we choose a sequence M (ǫ) such that, for all α > 0,

ǫαM (ǫ) = 0,

lim

and

Then we have the following proposition which is Proposition 4.2 in [20]:

ln M (ǫ) = o(| ln ǫ|) as ǫ → 0.

Proposition 3.3 (Sandier-Serfaty [20]). If u satisﬁes Eǫ(u) < c0M (ǫ) for some constant c0 and
some 0 < ǫ < 1, then there exist disjoint balls B1, ..., Bl with Bi = B(ai, ri) such that, denoting
˜Ω = {x ∈ Ω : dist(x, ∂Ω) > ǫ}, we have

Now we prove the lower bound estimate in Theorem 1. The proof follows a standard idea used for the
Ginzburg-Landau energy. Here the treatment of the magnetic potential ~A is slightly diﬀerent due to
the layered structure of the problem.

4 Construction of the order parameters

In this and the next sections, we construct the recovery sequence satisfying the upper bound inequality
in Theorem 1. This section is devoted to the construction of the order parameters {un} on the layers.
Essentially, on each layer, we follow constructions of test conﬁgurations for the 2D Ginzburg-Landau
energy used in [19] and [17]. Here additional work is needed to take into account the limiting process
as the interlayer distance s tends to zero. This introduces several aspects of technical issues. First,
this changes the locations of the layers and the vortices on the layers. Secondly, our results in this
section do not rely on the assumption (1.14). In other words, the estimates are independent of the
relative size of ǫ and s. Lastly, we need to show compactness for discrete quantities that are in the
form of sums of functions deﬁned on the layers. As a result, some technical modiﬁcations of the 2D
constructions as well as compactness results are needed in the proof.

Given v ∈ V ∩ C∞(D; R2) and s = L

N , for all n = 0, 1, ..., N − 1, we deﬁne vn(ˆx) = v(ˆx, ns) and

wn(ˆx) = w(ˆx, ns), where w(x) = 1

2 curlv(x). Let

vs(x) :=

N −1

Xn=0

vn(ˆx)χn(x3),

ws(x) :=

wn(ˆx)χn(x3).

N −1

Xn=0

It is clear that

vs → v

and ws → w uniformly as s → 0.

(4.1)

The main result of this section is the following

Theorem 4.1. Given v ∈ V ∩ C∞(D; R2), there exists a sequence {uǫ
that

n}N

n=0 ⊂ [H 1(Ω; C)]N +1 such

and

The above theorem generalizes Proposition 7.1 in [17], in which a recovery sequence for the 2D
Ginzburg-Landau energy is constructed. Here we construct functions uǫ
n on the layers Ωn = Ω × {ns}
based on the two-dimensional constructions given in [19] and [17]. We follow the approach given in
[17], which is more convenient in the three-dimensional context. As mentioned above, some technical
modiﬁcations of the 2D constructions are needed to obtain uniform estimates on the layers. Also,
some compactness results need to be proved. (In particular, see Lemma 4.2.)

Since Ω is a simply connected smooth domain, it is well-known that one can decompose L2(Ω; R2)

as a direct sum

where

and

L2(Ω; R2) = F ⊕ G ,

F := {v : v = ˆ∇ × f, f ∈ H 1(Ω), f = 0 on ∂Ω},

G := {v : v = ˆ∇g, g ∈ H 1(Ω)}.

(See, e.g., [14].) For each vn, we write

vn = vn,1 + vn,2,

(4.5)

where vn,1 ∈ F and vn,2 ∈ G . Then we have

vn,1 = (∂2f, −∂1f )

for some f ∈ H 1(Ω) with f = 0 on ∂Ω. By simple calculations, we have

− ˆ∆f = curlvn,1 = curlvn = 2wn,

where ˆ∆ denotes the 2D Laplacian. Therefore, we write f = −2 ˆ∆−1
where ˆ∆−1

D wn, and vn,1 = −2 ˆ∇ × ˆ∆−1

First, we prove compactness of the sequences {vs

1} and {vs

2} in L2(D; R2).

Lemma 4.2. Let vs

1 and vs

2 be as above. There exist v1, v2 ∈ L2(D; R2) such that

v1 + v2 = v,

vs
1 → v1

and

vs
2 → v2

in L2(D; R2) as s → 0,

and

1, v2i = hv1, vs
for all s, where h·, ·i denotes the inner product in L2(D; R2).

hv1, v2i = hvs

2i = 0

Proof. Let {sk} be a sequence such that limk→∞ sk = 0. We denote vk = vsk and vk
i = 1, 2. It follows from (4.1) that

i = vsk

i

for

vk
1 + vk

2 = vk → v

in L2(D; R2) as k → ∞.

(4.6)

Since kvkk2

2 = kvk

2 + kvk

2, we deduce from (4.6) that {vk

2 k2

1 k2

1 } and {vk

2 } form bounded sequences in

for some subsequence {vkj

i }. It is clear that v1 + v2 = v. From the weak convergence, we have

vkj

and vkj

2 ⇀ v2

hv1, v2i = lim
j→∞

hvkj

since vkj

1 and vkl

2 are mutually orthogonal for all kj and kl. Similarly, we have

hvkj

2 i = 0.

It follows from (4.6)-(4.8) that

0 = lim

from which we immediately deduce

vkj
1 → v1

and vkj

2 → v2.

Suppose that another subsequence {vmj

i } of {vk

i }, for i = 1, 2, satisﬁes

for some ˜v1 and ˜v2. Clearly we have ˜v1 + ˜v2 = v. Using a similar argument as in (4.7), we have

vmj
1 → ˜v1

and vmj

2 → ˜v2

It follows that

h˜v1, ˜v2i = h˜v1, v2i = hv1, ˜v2i = 0.

0 = h(v1 + v2) − (˜v1 + ˜v2), (v1 + v2) − (˜v1 + ˜v2)i
= h(v1 − ˜v1) + (v2 − ˜v2), (v1 − ˜v1) + (v2 − ˜v2)i
= kv1 − ˜v1k2

2 + kv2 − ˜v2k2
2,

from which we have v1 = ˜v1 and v2 = ˜v2. By a contradiction argument, this implies that the
subsequence {vkj
i }. Therefore, we have strong
L2 compactness for the whole sequence {vk

i } contains all but at most ﬁnitely many terms in {vk

i } for i = 1, 2.

In the following, we construct recovery sequences for v1 and v2 respectively, as has been done in

[17].

4.1 Recovery sequence for v1

Lemma 4.3. Let v1 be as in Lemma 4.2. There exists a sequence {uǫ
that the conclusions of Theorem 4.1 hold with v replaced by v1.

n=0 ⊂ [H 1(Ω; C)]N +1 such

To prove the above Lemma 4.3, we will need a couple of auxiliary lemmas. We deﬁne ξ(ˆx) =

(x2,−x1)

|ˆx|2

and deﬁne ηǫ := η( x

. Let η : R2 → R be a standard molliﬁer supported in the unit ball in R2 such that RR2 η = 1,

ǫ )/ǫ2. We deﬁne qǫ : R2 → R by requiring

qǫ(ˆx)ξ(ˆx) = ηǫ ∗ ξ(ˆx).

(4.9)

We have the following lemma taken from [17], Lemma 7.3, which summarizes some useful properties
of the function qǫ.

Lemma 4.4 (Jerrard-Soner [17]). The function qǫ is well-deﬁned, smooth and radial, and has the
following properties:

0 ≤ qǫ ≤ 1,

qǫ(ˆx) = 1 whenever |ˆx| ≥ ǫ,

qǫ(ˆx) = q1(

(4.14)

as (ǫ, s) → (0, 0).

Proof. The proof relies on selecting points on each layer Ωn = Ω × {ns}. Let

For each ǫ, we deﬁne the family of squares in R2

δǫ = | ln ǫ|− 1
4 .

{Qǫ

i}i = {[kδǫ, (k + 1)δǫ] × [lδǫ, (l + 1)δǫ] : k, l ∈ Z}.

Denote

Iǫ := {i : Qǫ

i ∩ Ω 6= ∅}.

We write Ωn = ∪iΩǫ

n,i, where Ωǫ

n,i = Ωn ∩ Qǫ

i for i ∈ Iǫ. In each Ωǫ

n,i, we deﬁne

M ǫ

Note that M ǫ

Upon relabeling of {aǫ

Therefore, it suﬃces to prove strong convergence of wǫ,s in W −1,p for all p < 3
2 and
take a test function φ ∈ W 1,p′
p′ = 1. It is clear that p′ > 3. By
the Sobolev embedding theorem, we have φ ∈ C0,α(D) for some α > 0 and kφkC 0,α(D) ≤ C for some
constant C depending on p′. (See, e.g., [12].) It suﬃces to verify

Now we provide the proof of Lemma 4.3. We follow the ideas in the proof of Lemma 7.2 in [17],

with some technical modiﬁcations to take care of the limiting process as s → 0.

The above theorem plays a crucial role in proving compactness of quantities involving the magnetic
potential ~Aǫ. The key step in the proof of Theorem 5.1 is the following Lemma 5.2, which generalizes
Theorem 3.1 to the continuous case. For i = 1, 2, we deﬁne Ai
0(x) =
0(x). We denote Dn = Ω × (ns, (n + 1)s) for all n = 0, 1, ..., N − 1. In the following lemma,

Let ˜Ω ⊂ R2 be a bounded open set such that Ω ⊂ ˜Ω, and dist(Ω, ∂ ˜Ω) ≥ δ. We denote ˜Dn =
˜Ω × (ns − δ, (n + 1)s + δ). It is clear that, for all x ∈ Dn, dist(x, ∂ ˜Dn) ≥ δ. Note that hg is harmonic
in ˜Dn. By interior estimates for harmonic functions (see, e.g., [12]), for all x ∈ Dn, we have

From the above, we deduce that

L2(Dn) ≤ Cs4α−1kgik2

By standard interior elliptic estimates, we have that khbkH2(Dn) ≤ C(cid:16)khbkL2( ˜Dn) + kgiχDb

This along with Lemma 5.2 give Theorem 5.1.

6 Proof of Theorem 1: completed

In this section, we complete the proof of the upper bound in Theorem 1. Then we give the proof of
Corollary 1 in the introduction.

Proof of (1.16). Let (v0, ~A0) ∈ V × K0 be a minimizer of Gh0 . Using Proposition 2.2, we can ﬁnd
a sequence {vk} ⊂ V ∩ C∞(D; R2) such that (2.5)-(2.6) hold. Using Theorem 4.1 for each vk and a
diagonal argument, we can ﬁnd {uǫ

(A.11)

Next we show that the above local approximation can be improved to global approximation, given
that our domain D is suﬃciently smooth. We do this by showing that, for every v ∈ V , one can
extend it to some ˜v ∈ L2(R3; R2) such that curl˜v is a ﬁnite Radon measure and |curl˜v|(∂D) = 0.
Such arguments follow the extension techniques for BV functions in Lipschitz domains. (See, e.g., [4],
Chapter 3.) In the following, for an open set U ⊂ R3, we deﬁne

V (U ) := {v ∈ L2(U ; R2) : curlv ∈ M(U )}.

Lemma A.2. There exists an extension operator T : V (D) → V (R3), such that, for all v ∈ V (D),
T v|D = v and |curlT v|(∂D) = 0.

Proof. The proof is divided into four steps.

Step 1. First, we make some simpliﬁcations. Since Ω ⊂ R2 is a smooth domain, we can ﬁnd ﬁnitely
many open rectangles {Ri} such that Ω ⊂ ∪iRi, and each Ri satisﬁes either Ri ⊂ Ω or Ri ∩ ∂Ω 6= ∅.
If Ri ∩ ∂Ω 6= ∅, by a rotation and translation, we may assume that ∂Ω ∩ Ri is the graph of a smooth
function deﬁned on one side of Ri, and that it does not intersect with this side and the opposite side
of Ri. Let {ζi} be a partition of unity subordinate to the covering {Ri}. Let Qi = Ri × (0, L). We
only need to deﬁne appropriate extensions Ti on each Qi that satisfy the conclusions of Lemma A.2.

Then we can deﬁne T v = Pi Tivi with vi = vζi in ∪iQi, and extend T v to be zero in R3 \ ∪iQi.

One can check that T v ∈ V (R3) satisﬁes the conclusions of Lemma A.2. Now we ﬁx some Ri with
Ri ∩ ∂Ω 6= ∅. By a rotation and dilation, we may assume Ri = l × (−1, 1) for some open interval
l ⊂ R. By a smooth deformation, we may assume that Ri ∩ Ω = l × (0, 1). Such simpliﬁcations are
standard in the BV setting. (See, e.g., [4], Chapter 3.) In the following, we deﬁne the extension Ti
on Qi. We omit the subscript i in the rest of the proof. We denote Q+ = Q ∩ D, Q− = Q \ Q+, and
Γ = Q ∩ ∂D.

Step 2. Assume v ∈ C∞(Q+). We deﬁne T to be a reﬂection across Γ:

T v(x1, x2, x3) =((cid:0)v1(x1, x2, x3), v2(x1, x2, x3)(cid:1)

(cid:0)v1(x1, −x2, x3), −v2(x1, −x2, x3)(cid:1)

if x ∈ Q+,
if x ∈ Q−.

(A.12)

One can easily check that T v ∈ V (Q) and |curlT v|(Γ) = 0. Moreover, we have |curlT v|(Q) ≤
2|curlv|(Q+).

Step 3. Assume v ∈ C∞(Q+). We deﬁne T v as in (A.12) in Q−. It is clear that T v ∈ L2(Q).
Let Q+
ǫ = {x ∈ Q : x2 > ǫ} and Γǫ = {x ∈ Q : x2 = ǫ}. We deﬁne vǫ(x1, x2, x3) = v(x1, x2 + ǫ, x3).
Let τ = (1, 0, 0) and (vǫ)τ = vǫ(x1, 0, x3) · τ be the planar tangential component of v on Γǫ, where
we identity 2D vector ﬁelds as 3D vector ﬁelds with the x3 component equal to zero. Let ϕ ∈ C1
c (Q)
be a test function with sup |ϕ| ≤ 1. Using an integration by parts, and noting that v has compact
support in Q+ with respect to the sides of Q, we have

A similar argument yields

(curlvǫϕǫ − curlvǫϕ)dx → 0.

which implies curlT v ∈ M(Q), and |curlT v|(Γ) = 0.

Step 4. Finally, assume v ∈ V (Q+). We deﬁne T v to be the reﬂection as in Step 3. Using Lemma
A.1, we can ﬁnd a sequence {vk} ⊂ V (Q+) ∩ C∞(Q+) such that (A.1) and (A.2) hold. According to
(A.17), we can deﬁne (vk)τ as the limit of (vǫ

Since T v in Q− is a reﬂection of v, the traces of T v|Q+ and T v|Q− in the sense of (A.21) agree on Γ.
It follows that

T v · ˆ∇⊥ϕdx ≤ 2|curlv|(Q+).

−ZQ

Taking the supremum over all ϕ with sup |ϕ| ≤ 1, we conclude that curlT v ∈ M(Q), and |curlT v|(Q) ≤
2|curlv|(Q+). On the other hand, we have |curlT v|(Q) = |curlT v|(Q+) + |curlT v|(Q−) + |curlT v|(Γ) ≥
2|curlv|(Q+). Therefore, it is clear that |curlT v|(Γ) = 0.

Combining Lemmas A.1 and A.2, we obtain Proposition 2.2.
