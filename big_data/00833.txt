We study the thermo-magnetic behavior of the strong coupling constant and quark mass entering
the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The behavior of the quark condensate as function of magnetic ﬁeld
strength and temperature is also obtained and confronted with lattice QCD results. We ﬁnd that
for temperatures above the chiral/deconﬁnement phase transitions, where the condensate decreases
monotonically with increasing ﬁeld, the coupling also decreases monotonically. For temperatures
below the transition temperature we ﬁnd that the coupling initially grows and then decreases with
increasing ﬁeld strength. We consider this turnover behavior as a key element in the behavior of
the quark condensate above the transition temperature. Hence, it allows for an understanding of
the inverse magnetic catalysis phenomenon.

INTRODUCTION

The study of the properties of strongly interacting mat-
ter at high temperature and/or density, in the presence
of magnetic ﬁelds, has become a subject of growing in-
terest over the past few years. Examples of physical sys-
tems where such properties are relevant include heavy-
ion collisions, and compact stellar objects. One of the
intriguing aspects of these properties, not yet well under-
stood (at least in a consensual way), is the mechanism
of the so-called inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) phe-
nomenon found by lattice QCD (LQCD) calculations [1–
3]. To recall, IMC is characterized by a decreasing chi-
ral/deconﬁnement phase transition temperatures and a
decreasing quark condensate (above the critical temper-
ature Tc ∼ 150 MeV) with increasing ﬁeld strength. Dif-
ferent approaches have been explored in order to either
ﬁnd or include IMC in QCD [4]. Some of these ap-
proaches provide an explanation [5], and almost all sug-
gest the need for additional mechanisms for magnetic-
induced modiﬁcations to QCD properties. In particular,
the modiﬁcation of the QCD coupling due to magnetic
screening at low temperature, and anti-screening at high
temperature, has been shown to be a plausible mecha-
nism explaining IMC [6, 7]. This also seems to be the
reason why eﬀective models without such modiﬁcations
do not describe the behavior of the critical temperature
nor the properties of the quark condensate at high tem-
perature [8–17].

Obtaining the detailed screening/anti-screening prop-
erties of the strong coupling as a function of the magnetic

ﬁeld strength is not a simple task. In fact, for most of
the parameter space these properties belong to the non-
perturbative domain. Nevertheless, it should be possible
to extract general features of this coupling by combin-
ing information from eﬀective models with LQCD. The
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) is one of such models. It has
been extensively used e.g.
to explore the chiral tran-
sition [18, 19].
In addition, it can be used to formu-
late a simpliﬁed version of the QCD gap equation within
the Schwinger-Dyson equations framework. In this case,
the dynamically generated mass M is independent of the
quark momentum, and the interaction is given by a four-
fermion contact term with a coupling G. A relevant ques-
tion is whether it is possible to extract information on the
coupling G as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld strength
by combining the NJL model with LQCD results for the
quark condensate. In addition, establish whether this in-
formation could be used to ﬁnd clues on the microscopic
origins of IMC. In this paper we follow this approach.
In fact, we use the NJL model to extract the behav-
ior of G and M as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld for
diﬀerent temperatures using LQCD data for the quark
condensate [2] as input into the gap equation. Notice
that if there were a link between the melting of the con-
densate as a function of eB above the transition tem-
perature and the coupling, then the latter should also
decrease with increasing magnetic ﬁeld intensity. This
behavior would signal that a decreasing coupling weak-
ens the bond between quark-antiquark pairs above the
critical temperature.
In this paper we show this to be
the case. The remaining of the manuscript is organized

as follows: In Sec II we establish the framework by writ-
ing the expression for the gap equation and the quark
propagator obtained from the NJL model in the mean
ﬁeld approximation. These equations, together with the
expression for the quark condensate in terms of the quark
propagator, lead to the behavior of M and G as a func-
tion of the ﬁeld strength for diﬀerent temperatures. In
Sec. III we include the eﬀects of the magnetic ﬁeld by
means of Schwinger proper-time method. Since the NJL
model is non-renormalizable, in order to ﬁnd the behav-
ior of M and G as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld we
ﬁrst determine the value of the ultraviolet cutoﬀ param-
eter from the vacuum values of M and of the conden-
sate.
In Sec. IV we solve the gap equation to extract
G and M using as input the LQCD behavior of the up
and down quark condensates as a function of the ﬁeld
strength. Since the light quarks have diﬀerent charges,
we ﬁnd the corresponding values for their coupling con-
stants Gu,d and dynamically generated masses Mu,d. We
ﬁnally summarize and conclude in Sec. V.

II. GAP EQUATION AND QUARK
CONDENSATE IN THE NJL MODEL

The NJL model is deﬁned by means of the Lagrangian

density

L = ¯ψ(i6 ∂ − m)ψ + G(cid:16)(cid:0) ¯ψψ(cid:1)2

+(cid:0) ¯ψiγ5τ ψ(cid:1)2(cid:17) ,

(1)

where τ are the Pauli matrices in isospin space, and ψ is
a quark ﬁeld.

On general grounds, in the mean ﬁeld approximation,
and after a bosonization process, the Lagrangian can
be rewritten as a vacuum term plus a free fermion La-
grangian with a dressed mass, namely

LM F = −

σ2
4G

+ ¯ψ(i6 ∂ − M )ψ ,

(2)

where σ = 2Gh ¯ψψi and M = m + σ. Here we do not con-
sider pion condensation eﬀects, so the only contribution
comes from the sigma meson in the bosonization proce-
dure. The value of the mean ﬁeld is determined through
the gap equation, obtained by minimizing the eﬀective
potential with respect to the mean ﬁeld [18, 19]

M − m = 2GZ

with the trace referring to color, ﬂavor and Lorentz in-
dices. We notice that the quark condensate h ¯ψψi is given
by

h ¯ψψi = −Z

(2π)4 Tr[iS(p)].

The propagator is given by

S(p) =

Eqs. (3) and (4) represent the two independent equa-
tions providing information on the thermo-magnetic be-
havior of the coupling G and the dynamically generated
mass M , after using LQCD results for the quark conden-
sates [2].

III. THERMOMAGNETIC EFFECTS

To account for the magnetic ﬁeld, we emphasize that
the above described bosonization does not aﬀect the form
of the gap equation (3) nor the condensate (4), and the
eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld is reﬂected in the dressing of
the quark propagator in a magnetic ﬁeld, for which we
resort to Schwinger proper time representation for the
two-point function

namely B = B ˆz. This conﬁguration can be obtained
from an external vector potential which we choose in the

Notice that since the magnetic ﬁeld breaks Lorentz in-
variance, the propagator involves a non-local, albeit path

closed one-loop diagram, as is required for the calcula-
tion of the condensate, this phase does not contribute
and thus we ignore it in the sequel.

Since the NJL model is non-renormalizable the inte-
gral above needs to be regularized. This can be done in
diﬀerent ways, the simplest being the introduction of an
ultraviolet cut-oﬀ. This is tantamount to introducing a
regulator as the lower limit cutoﬀ in the proper-time rep-
resentation. The parameter τ0 represents such regulator.

The sum in Eq. (12) can be expressed in terms of Ja-

We use this expression to ﬁnd the ultraviolet regulator

quark condensate to the value −h ¯ψψiT =0,B=0 = (0.269)3
GeV3 [20]. We ﬁnd

τ0 ≡ Λ−2

vac = 1.54 GeV−2.

(19)

This value of τ0 remains ﬁxed for the calculation of the
temperature and the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of the
condensates. For the current quark mass we use the value
mud = 0.0034 GeV. This value is obtained from the Gell-
Mann–Oakes-Renner relation for the above given value
of −h ¯ψψiT =0,B=0. From Eq. (3) the value of the corre-
sponding coupling constant in vacuum is

GT =0,B=0 = 7.62 GeV−2.

(20)

IV. THERMOMAGNETIC BEHAVIOR OF THE

DYNAMICALLY GENERATED MASSES AND

COUPLINGS

We now proceed to ﬁnd the thermo-magnetic behavior
of G for both up- and down-quarks. The procedure is
to ﬁrst ﬁnd the best ﬁt of Mud allowed by the model,
Eq. (16), using for the left-hand side the lattice results for
the quark condensate found in Ref. [2]. Once Mu,d(B; T )
is determined we use Eq. (3) to solve for Gu,d(B; T ).

To establish how well the solutions for Mu,d describe
the condensates as functions of eB and T one considers
Figs. 1 and 2, which show h ¯ψψiu and h ¯ψψid as functions
of eB for the values T = 0 MeV, 113 MeV, 130 MeV
and 176 MeV. Notice that our description of the LQCD
results becomes better as the temperature increases.

The behavior of the up- and down-quark masses as
functions of the ﬁeld strength is depicted in Figs. 3 and 4,
respectively. Notice that for all temperatures, except
the highest one, the masses start oﬀ increasing with the
magnetic ﬁeld. However, there is a turn-over behavior
for intermediate values of eB where the masses start de-
creasing. For the largest temperature, which is above the
transition temperature, the masses are monotonically de-
creasing functions of the ﬁeld strength.

Figures 5 and 6 show the behavior of the couplings
Gu,d as function of the ﬁeld strength for diﬀerent tem-
peratures. The couplings show a similar behavior as the
masses for all temperatures except the largest one. The
masses start oﬀ increasing with the magnetic ﬁeld but
there is a turn-over behavior at intermediate values of
eB where the couplings start decreasing. However, for
the largest temperature, which is above the transition

and 176 MeV, respectively. The model describes better the lattice results as the temperature increases.

functions of the ﬁeld strength.

Finally, in Figure 7 we show the average value of the
coupling, Gud = (Gu + Gd)/2 as a function of the ﬁeld
strength for the values T = 0 MeV, 113 MeV, 130 MeV
and 176 MeV.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we studied the thermo-magnetic behavior
of the coupling constant in the extended NJL model. We
used the gap equation and the quark condensate expres-
sion obtained from the model. Using the lattice QCD
results for the light-quark condensates in the presence
of a magnetic ﬁeld [2], we obtained the behavior of the
couplings Gu,d as a function of the temperature and the
magnetic ﬁeld strength.

Our results show that for temperatures above the tran-
sition temperature, the couplings are monotonically de-
creasing functions of the ﬁeld strength. This means that
at these temperatures the melting of the quark conden-
sates is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the
strength of the interaction that binds these quarks.

For temperatures close to, but below the transition
temperature, we ﬁnd a turn over behavior of the cou-
plings. As the ﬁeld strength starts increasing, the cou-

plings increase. However, for intermediate values of the
ﬁeld strength the couplings decrease. This signals that as
the temperature decreases below, but close to the transi-
tion temperature, the strength of the coupling increases.
This increase is accompanied by a corresponding increase
in the value of the condensate. Nevertheless, this increase
is not sustained, as for stronger ﬁelds the couplings de-
crease, as do the condensates.

For a vanishing temperature our expectation was that
the increase of the couplings with ﬁeld strength would be
continually sustained. However, we ﬁnd that although
the couplings start oﬀ with a strong increase, they even-
tually fade out with increasing ﬁeld. This can be related
to the fact that the model description of the condensates
is less accurate at low temperatures than at high temper-
atures.

We recall that the mass function in the local NJL
model is momentum-independent for a given tempera-
ture and ﬁeld strength. However, it is well known that in
QCD the dynamically generated mass runs with the mo-
mentum scale from the non-perturbative to the asymp-
totically free regimes. At low temperatures, this momen-
tum dependence is crucial to understand how the light
quarks acquire their dynamically generated masses in the
vacuum. This means that one cannot expect this model,
with a momentum independent mass, to accurately de-
scribe the behavior of the couplings as a function of the

magnetic ﬁeld. On the other hand, at high temperature
the momentum dependence of the mass function is sup-
pressed according to perturbation theory and thus the
large scale is now the temperature. Hence, in such a
domain the behavior of the inferred couplings is more
accurate.

In conclusion, in the high temperature domain, where
is expected to be more reliable, we have

shown that the decrease of the condensate with the ﬁeld
strength is accompanied by a corresponding decrease of
the couplings. We have also shown that the behavior of
the condensates and the couplings with the ﬁeld strength
is similar for temperatures close and below the transition
temperature. Although this is not the case for vanishing
temperature, we attribute this to the lack of a dynam-

the model in vacuum, a feature that can be improved
with a more realistic truncation of the Schwinger-Dyson
equation of QCD. Nevertheless, our results suggest that
IMC, as described by the thermo-magnetic behavior of
the quark condensate, can be linked to the properties of
the coupling constant as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld
in a wide range of temperatures.
