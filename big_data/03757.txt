Nondeterministic quantum communication complexity:

the cyclic equality game and iterated matrix multiplication

Harry Buhrman1, Matthias Christandl2, Jeroen Zuiddam1

April 5, 2016

Abstract

We study nondeterministic multiparty quantum communication with a quantum
generalization of broadcasts. We show that, with number-in-hand classical inputs,
the communication complexity of a Boolean function in this communication model
equals the logarithm of the support rank of the corresponding tensor, whereas the
approximation complexity in this model equals the logarithm of the border support
rank. This characterisation allows us to prove a log-rank conjecture posed by Vil-
lagra et al. for nondeterministic multiparty quantum communication with message
passing.

The support rank characterization of the communication model connects quan-
tum communication complexity intimately to the theory of asymptotic entangle-
ment transformation and algebraic complexity theory. In this context, we introduce
the graphwise equality problem. For a cycle graph, the complexity of this communi-
cation problem is closely related to the complexity of the computational problem of
multiplying matrices, or more precisely, it equals the logarithm of the support rank
of the iterated matrix multiplication tensor. We employ Strassen’s laser method
to show that asymptotically there exist nontrivial protocols for every odd-player
cyclic equality problem. We exhibit an eﬃcient protocol for the 5-player problem
for small inputs, and we show how Young ﬂattenings yield nontrivial complexity
lower bounds.

1. Introduction

Let f : X × Y × Z → {0, 1} be a function on a product of ﬁnite sets X, Y and Z.
Alice, Bob and Charlie have to compute f in the following sense. Alice receives an
x ∈ X, Bob receives a y ∈ Y and Charlie receives a z ∈ Z, and each player receives a
private random bit string. Then the players communicate in rounds. Each round, one
player communicates by broadcasting a bit to the other players. After these rounds of
communication, each player has to output a bit, such that if f (x, y, z) = 1, then with
some nonzero probability all players output 1 and if f (x, y, z) = 0, then with probability
zero all players output 1. The complexity of such a protocol is the number of broadcasts
in the protocol, and we denote the minimum complexity of all such protocols by N(f ).

Now we allow the players to be quantum, as follows. Alice receives an x ∈ X, Bob
receives a y ∈ Y and Charlie receives a z ∈ Z. Then, in rounds, the players communicate
by creating a GHZ-like state

|GHZi = α |000i + β |111i

and sharing this state among each other, a quantum broadcast. Moreover, the players
can do any local quantum computations. Again, after these rounds of communication,
each player has to output a bit, such that if f (x, y, z) = 1, then with some nonzero
probability all players output 1 and if f (x, y, z) = 0, then with probability zero all
players output 1. The quantum complexity of such a quantum protocol is the number
of broadcasts in the protocol, and we denote the minimum complexity of all quantum
protocols by NQ(f ). We will make this deﬁnition more precise and more general in
Section 2. Note that the quantum model can simulate the classical model. Also note
that, nondeterministically, one quantum broadcast can be used to send a qubit from one
player to another by using teleportation (see Theorem 9); the quantum model can thus
simulate a message-passing model.

Our results.

• Our main technical result is that the quantum complexity of a function in the
above model equals the logarithm of the so-called support rank of the tensor

Px,y,z f (x, y, z) |xi|yi|zi corresponding to f . We prove this in Section 2.

• Modifying the quantum model such that the players can only communicate by
message passing — that is, in each communication round one player sends a qubit
to one other player — increases the complexity by at most a factor k − 1, and this
relationship is tight. However, asymptotically in the input size, the increase is only
k/2 and this relationship is tight. This solves a nondeterministic multiplayer quan-
tum log-rank conjecture in the message-passing model of Villagra et al. [VNYN13].
This topic is covered in Section 3.

• We deﬁne the k-player graphwise equality problem to be the problem in which k
players are identiﬁed with vertices in a graph G, and each player has to compute
the equality function with his neighbours in G. Of particular interest is the cycle
graph G = Ck and the corresponding cyclic equality problem. For this cyclic
equality problem, in the classical broadcast model, the naïve protocol in which
every player broadcasts his inputs is the optimal protocol. The same holds in
the quantum model when k is even. Interestingly, we show with Strassen’s laser
method that for all odd k ≥ 3 there is a nontrivial quantum protocol. Moreover, for
all odd k ≥ 3 we give nontrivial lower bounds on the value of NQ by use of Young
ﬂattenings. These results are related to the complexity of matrix multiplication
and iterated matrix multiplication. A consequence of our work is that ﬁnding new
protocols for the cyclic equality problem for three players yields new algorithms for
matrix multiplication. Section 4 covers the classical case, the even quantum case,
an explicit quantum protocol for k = 5, and the Young ﬂattening lower bound.
Section 5 covers the Strassen laser method.

Related work. The two-player nondeterministic quantum communication model was
introduced by De Wolf [Wol03]. He shows that the communication complexity in this

2

model is characterized by the logarithm of the support rank of the communication ma-
trix. Quantum broadcast channels have been studied by e.g. Ambainis et al. [ABDR04].
Multiparty nondeterministic quantum communication with message passing has been
studied by Villagra et al. [VNYN13]. They show that the logarithm of the support
rank of the communication tensor is a lower bound for the message-passing complexity
and conjecture that this lower bound is polynomially related to the message-passing
complexity.

The support rank of 3-tensors has been studied by Cohn and Umans in the context
of the complexity of matrix multiplication [CU13]. They give nontrivial upper bounds
on the support rank of the matrix multiplication tensor that do not come from upper
bounds on the tensor rank. As an interesting fact, we note that given a matrix A and a
number k, deciding whether the support rank of A is at least k is NP-hard [BK15].

The complexity of matrix multiplication plays a central role in algebraic complexity
theory. We refer to [BCS97] for general background information. Connections between
algebraic complexity theory and entanglement transformations have been studied before,
see for example [CDS08]. The iterated matrix multiplication tensor has been studied in
the context of arithmetic circuit complexity and the VP versus VNP problem, see for
example [Ges15]. To the knowledge of the authors, the tensor rank or support rank of
the iterated matrix multiplication tensor has not been studied before.

2. Support rank characterization of the quantum broadcast model

We refer to Nielsen and Chuang [NC10] for background information on the quantum
computation model.

Quantum multiparty communication protocol. We will give two deﬁnitions of a
quantum broadcast model, which are equivalent in the nondeterministic setting. The
ﬁrst model clearly generalizes the classical broadcast model, while the second model is
easier to analyse. For any natural number m, denote by [m] the set {1, 2, . . . , m}. Let k
be a positive integer and let f be a Boolean function on [2n]k = [2n] × [2n] × · · · × [2n],

f : [2n]k → {0, 1}.

We deﬁne a k-player quantum communication protocol as follows. Each player i has
a local Hilbert space Hi with a register initialised in the input state |xii. The players
have access to a quantum broadcast channel, which, given a qubit state α |0i + β |1i,
will create the state α |0i⊗k + β |1i⊗k and distribute this state among the k players.

3

The players proceed in communication rounds; each round a designated player uses the
broadcast channel. Let Ri be the ﬁrst qubit of Hi and let R = R1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Rk. After the
communication is ﬁnished, we apply a projection onto |11 · · · 1i in R. If the resulting
tensor is 0 then the output of the protocol is 0, otherwise the output of the protocol
is 1. The complexity of the protocol is the number of communication rounds. We say
the protocol nondeterministically computes f if the probability that the output equals 1
is nonzero if f (x1, . . . , xk) = 1 and the probability that the output equals 0 is one if
f (x1, . . . , xk) = 0.

We will now give an equivalent deﬁnition of the quantum broadcast model. This
is the deﬁnition that we will use in the rest of the paper. Each player i has a ﬁnite-
dimensional Hilbert space Hi. The protocol thus takes place in the space H1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Hk.
The space is initialised in the state |x1 · · · xki |GHZk

r i, where

|GHZk

r i :=

rXa=1

|ai|ai · · · |ai ∈ (Cr)⊗k

is the k-party GHZ-state of rank r, shared among the k players, and xi ∈ [2n] is the
classical input to player i. (For clarity we will suppress any normalizations in quantum
states when possible.) The players now apply local quantum operations. Let Ri be the
ﬁrst qubit of Hi and let R = R1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Rk. We apply a projection onto |11 · · · 1i in
R. If the resulting tensor is 0 then the output of the protocol is 0, otherwise the output
of the protocol is 1. The complexity of the protocol is log2(r). We say the protocol
nondeterministically computes f if the probability that the output equals 1 is nonzero if
f (x1, . . . , xk) = 1 and the probability that the output equals 0 is one if f (x1, . . . , xk) = 0.

Deﬁnition 1. Let k be a positive integer and let f be a function [2n]k → {0, 1}. The
k-player nondeterministic quantum communication complexity of f is the minimal com-
plexity of a k-player quantum communication protocol that nondeterministically com-
putes f , and is denoted by NQ(f ).

Approximating protocols. Let f be a function [2n]k → {0, 1}. Let (Πj)j∈N be
a sequence of protocols, such that when f (x1, . . . , xk) = 1, the probability that Πj
outputs 1 on input x converges to a nonzero number as j goes to inﬁnity, and when
f (x1, . . . , xk) = 0, the probability that Πj outputs 0 on input x converges to 1 as j goes
to inﬁnity. Then we say that the sequence (Πj)j∈N approximately nondeterministically
computes f . The complexity of an approximating sequence is the maximum complexity
of any protocol Πj in the sequence.

Deﬁnition 2. The k-player approximate nondeterministic quantum communication com-
plexity of f is the minimal complexity of a sequence (Πj) that approximately nondeter-
ministically computes f , and is denoted by NQ(f ).

Classical protocol. We deﬁne a k-player classical communication protocol as follows.
Each player receives a classical input and a private random bit string. The protocol
proceeds in rounds. Each round we let a single predetermined player communicate by
broadcasting a bit to all the other players. After the last communication round, every
player presents an output bit.
If all the output bits are 1, then the output of the
protocol is 1; otherwise the output of the protocol is 0. Again, we say the classical
protocol nondeterministically computes f if the probability that the output equals 1

4

is nonzero if f (x1, . . . , xk) = 1 and the probability that the output equals 0 is one if
f (x1, . . . , xk) = 0.

Deﬁnition 3. The k-player nondeterministic classical communication complexity of f
is the minimal complexity of a k-player classical communication protocol that nondeter-
ministically computes f , and is denoted by N(f ).

Remark 4. For simplicity, we have taken the input set for each of the k players to be
the same set [2n]. We note that the deﬁnitions in this section and most of the results in
this paper naturally generalize to the situation where the players get inputs from sets of
diﬀerent sizes.

Support rank and border support rank. Let t be a tensor in (Cm)⊗k. The tensor
rank of t is the smallest number r such that t can be written as a sum of r simple tensors,
i ∈ Cm. We denote the tensor
rank of t by R(t). Fix a basis for (Cm)⊗k and deﬁne the support of a tensor t in (Cm)⊗k
to be the set of basis element that occur with nonzero coeﬃcient in t. The support rank
or nondeterministic rank of t is the smallest number r such that there exists a tensor in
the space (Cm)⊗k with the same support as t and tensor rank r. We denote the support
rank of t by Rs(t). Note that support rank is basis dependent.

i for some vectors uj

The border rank of t is the smallest number r such that there exists a sequence of
tensors (tj)j∈N converging to t in the Euclidean topology (or equivalently in the Zariski
topology) such that R(tj) is at most r for every j. We denote the border rank of t
by R(t). The border support rank of t is the smallest number r such that there exists a
tensor in (Cm)⊗k with the same support as t and border rank r. We denote the border
support rank of t by Rs(t).

Theorem 5. Let f : [2n]k → {0, 1} be a function and let t be the tensor in (C2n

entries given by f , that is, t = Pi∈[2n]k f (i) |i1i|i2i · · · |iki. Then NQ(f ) = log2 Rs(t)

and NQ(f ) = log2 Rs(t).

Lemma 6 (Cleanup lemma). Let {|ψii : i ∈ [q]} ⊆ (Cm)⊗k be a set of k-tensors,
for some natural number q. Then there exists a k-partite rank-1 linear map hℓ| :=
hℓ1| ⊗ · · · ⊗ hℓk| with hℓj| ∈ (Cm)∗ such that hℓ|ψii 6= 0 for every i ∈ [q].

Proof. We will give a proof by recursively constructing hℓ|. Let Id be the identity map
on Cm.
If j ≤ k, ha| ∈ ((Cm)∗)⊗j and |bi ∈ (Cm)⊗k, then we denote by ha|bi the
contraction of ha| and |bi, that is, ha|bi = (ha| ⊗ Id⊗k−j) |bi.

The base case is hℓ| = 1. For the recursion, suppose we are given an element hℓ′| ∈
((Cm)∗)⊗j such that |φii := hℓ|ψii is nonzero for every i ∈ [q]. We will construct an
element hℓ| ∈ ((Cm)∗)⊗j+1 such that hℓ|ψii is nonzero for every i ∈ [q]. Since |φii is
nonzero for every i ∈ [q], there is an element hui| ∈ (Cm)∗ such that hui|φii is nonzero.
Consider the the maps (hu1| + x hu2|) |φii for i ∈ {1, 2}, in the variable x. Each map
only has a single root. Therefore, there exists a value α2 for x such that both maps
evaluate to a nonzero number. Next, consider the maps (hu1| + α2 hu2| + x hu3|) |φii
for i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, in variable x. Again, each of the three maps has only a single root.
Therefore, there exists a value α3 for x such that all three maps evaluate to a nonzero
number. Repeat this construction to obtain an element hu| ∈ (Cm)∗ such that hu|φii is
nonzero for every i ∈ [q]. Let hℓ| be hℓ′| ⊗ hu|.

Proof of Theorem 5. We ﬁrst show NQ(f ) ≤ log2 Rs(t). Let r be the support rank
of t. Then there exists a unit vector ψ ∈ (C2n
)⊗k with rank r and support equal
to the support of f . This means that there are vectors |uj
such that ψ =

† ⊗ |0ih0| .

Note that this operation introduces a new control qubit register which player j can
measure to see whether he applied Aj or A′
j.

The protocol for the k players is as follows. Let x1, . . . , xk be the inputs given to
the players. The players share a k-party GHZ-state of rank r. Player j applies Ej to his
part of the GHZ-state. If his control qubit is |0i then he sets his output qubit Ri to |0i.
Otherwise, he measures the rest of the system. If the outcome equals |xji, then he sets
Rj to |1i, otherwise he sets Rj to |0i.

The above protocol uses a GHZ-state of rank r, so it has complexity log2(r). We
claim that the protocol nondeterministically computes f .
If the players in the ﬁrst
measurement each get outcome |1i, then the state of the total system is |ψi. Because
|ψi has norm 1, this happens with nonzero probability|α1|2 · · ·|αk|2. If f (x1, . . . , xk) = 0,
then |x1 · · · xki does not occur in the support of ψ, so the probability that the players
measure |x1i , . . . , |xki respectively is zero. Hence in this case the register R is not in
state |11 · · · 1i. On the other hand, if f (x1, . . . , xk) 6= 0, then |x1 · · · xki does occur in
the support of ψ, so the probability that the players measure |x1i , . . . , |xki respectively
is nonzero. Hence with nonzero probability the register R is in state |11 · · · 1i.

We now show NQ(f ) ≥ log2 Rs(t). Suppose we have a protocol that nondeterministi-
cally computes f with complexity r. This means that the players perform local quantum
operations that together form a linear map L which transforms, for any x1, . . . , xk ∈ [2n],
the state

to a state of the form

|x1 · · · xki |GHZri

|x1 · · · xkiXa∈A

|ψa

xi |a1i|a2i · · · |aki ,

where the sum is over A := {a ∈ {0, 1}k | f (x1, . . . , xk) = a1 · a2 · · · ak} and where |ψa
xi
is some nonzero vector, representing the state of the work space of the players. Since
the map L is linear, it maps the tensor

to the tensor

|ψa

xi |a1 · · · aki .

s1 :=Xx1,...,xk
s2 :=Xx1,...,xk

|x1 · · · xki |GHZri

|x1 · · · xkiXa∈S

6

The tensor rank ofPx |x1 · · · xki is 1 and hence the tensor rank of s1 is r. Because L is a

local map, the tensor rank of s2 is at most r. By applying the cleanup lemma Lemma 6
and projecting on states with |a1 · · · aki = |1 · · · 1i, we obtain a tensor

s3 := Xx1,...,xk

|x1 · · · xki cx

where cx ∈ C is zero if f (x) = 0 and nonzero if f (x) = 1. The rank of the tensor s3
is at most r. The support of s3 equals the support of f , so the support rank of f is at
most r.

The statement about the approximate complexity of f follows from the deﬁnition of

border support rank.

Remark 7. We note that having a NQ-protocol for f of complexity n is the same as
having an SLOCC protocol for transforming GHZk
2n to a tensor with the same support
as f . We will use the SLOCC paradigm in some parts of the text.

3. Nondeterministic log-rank conjecture for message-passing protocols

Deﬁnition 8. Let NQ0(f ) be the minimal complexity of a protocol that nondetermin-
istically computes f , without preshared entanglement but with the added ability for
players to send a qubit to another player. The complexity of such a protocol is the total
number of qubits sent.

Villagra et al. [VNYN13] show that NQ0(f ) is at least the logarithm of the support
rank of f . They furthermore conjecture that NQ0(f ) is upper bounded by a polynomial
in the logarithm of the support rank. The following theorem proves this conjecture.

Theorem 9 (“Nondeterministic log-rank conjecture”). Let f : [2n]k → {0, 1}. Then we
have NQ(f ) ≤ NQ0(f ) ≤ (k − 1) NQ(f ).

Proof. For the ﬁrst inequality, suppose we have an NQ0-protocol for f . We replace the
communication of a qubit by the nondeterministic teleportation of that qubit. Before-
hand, all players agree on the basis in which the teleportation should happen. If any
teleportation during the protocol does not happen in this basis, then the player that
notices this sets his output register Ri to |0i.

For the second inequality, suppose we have an NQ-protocol for f which uses a GHZ-
state of rank r. Then we can construct a NQ0-protocol for f as follows. The players
start with no shared entanglement. Player 1 constructs a GHZ-state of rank r locally.
In the ﬁrst k − 1 communication rounds, player 1 distributes the GHZ-state over the
other k − 1 players. After that, the players perform the NQ-protocol. The resulting
NQ0-protocol has complexity at most (k − 1) NQ(f ).

To say something about the ‘tightness’ of Theorem 9 we consider the natural easy
function in the NQ-model, namely f (x1, . . . , xk) = [x1 = x2 = · · · = xk] with xi ∈ [2n].

Proposition 10 (Single bit inputs). Let f : [2]k → {0, 1} be the function deﬁned by
f (x1, . . . , xk) = [x1 = x2 = · · · = xk] for xi ∈ [2]. Then we have NQ(f ) = 1 and
NQ0(f ) = (k − 1) NQ(f ).

7

Proof. Note that the tensor of this function is GHZk
2, so NQ(f ) = 1. Now consider a
protocol that nondeterministically computes f without preshared entanglement and r
rounds of communication. We may assume, without loss of generality, that the protocol
consists of a ﬁrst phase in which the players communicate and a second phase in which
the players only do local quantum operations. After the ﬁrst phase the players are
sharing some state E consisting of EPR-pairs shared among certain pairs of the players.

We thus obtain a local linear map which maps Px |xi E to a tensor with the same

support as GHZk
2. However, if r < k − 1, then, viewing E as a graph, E is disconnected.
Therefore there is a grouping of the players into two groups such that there are no
EPR-pairs between the groups. Such a state cannot be converted to a GHZk
2 state by
SLOCC.

Asymptotically, we can improve the relationship stated in Theorem 9, as follows.

Theorem 11 (Asymptotic upper bound). For any ε > 0, there is an n0 such that for
all f : [m]k → {0, 1}, if NQ(f ) > n0, then

NQ0(f ) ≤

(k + ε)

2

NQ(f ).

To prove Theorem 11 we use the theory of asymptotic SLOCC conversion rates.

Deﬁnition 12. Given tensors ψ ∈ V1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Vk and φ ∈ W1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Wk, we say that ψ
can be transformed into φ via SLOCC operations, if there exist linear transformations
Ai : Vi → Ki such that φ = (A1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Ak)ψ; and we write ψ

Lemma 13. The limit ω(ψ, φ) exists and for all n the inequality ωn(ψ, φ) ≥ ω(ψ, φ)
holds; in other words, ωn = ω + o(1).

To prove the theorem, suppose we have an NQ-protocol for f which uses a GHZ
state of rank 2n and no communication. Consider the following NQ0-protocol for f .

The following proposition says that the asymptotic relationship of Theorem 11 is

tight.

[2n]k → {0, 1} be the function deﬁned by
Proposition 15 (n-bit inputs). Let f :
f (x1, . . . , xk) = [x1 = x2 = · · · = xk] for xi ∈ [2n]. Then we have NQ(f ) = n and
NQ0(f ) ≥ k

2 NQ(f ).

Proof. As in the previous proof, note that the tensor corresponding to f is GHZk
2n.
Suppose there is an NQ0 protocol using r messages. View the communication pattern
of this protocol as an undirected multigraph G (i.e. parallel edges are allowed) on k
vertices. Note that G has r edges. Let E = GHZG
2 be the tensor that has an EPR pair
at every edge in G. The protocol yields an SLOCC transformation of E to GHZk
2n. Let ℓ
be the minimal number of edges across any cut of G. Then ℓ is at most the minimal
degree d of G. The sum of all degrees in G equals 2r, so kℓ ≤ kd ≤ 2r, which implies
the inequality r ≥ kℓ/2. The number ℓ is equal to minS⊆[k] log2 rkS(E), where rkS(E)
denotes the rank of E after ﬂattening according to the set S. This value cannot increase
under any SLOCC transformation. Now note that log2 rk{i}(GHZk
2n) = n for any i ∈ [k],
so ℓ ≥ n. We conclude that r ≥ kn/2.

Remark 16. Another way to prove Proposition 15 is to ﬁrst symmetrize the protocol to
obtain an SLOCC transformation of a state E with log2 rk{i}(E) = (k−1)!2r to the state
GHZk
2k!n) = k! n. Since log2 rk{i} is an SLOCC-monotone,
we obtain the inequality (k − 1)! 2r ≥ k! n and hence r ≥ kn/2.

2k!n. We have log2 rk{i}(GHZk

4. Cyclic equality problem

The two-player equality problem EQn is the problem of Alice and Bob having to decide
whether their n-bit inputs are equal. Since the identity matrix has full support rank,
we have NQ(EQn) = n. We generalize EQn to multiple players as follows. Let G be
an undirected graph. Let EQG
n be the problem of |G| players having to solve the n-
bit equality problem between players connected by edges.
(Note that this deﬁnition
naturally generalizes to hypergraphs.) If G is a bipartite graph, one easily sees that by
grouping the players we can transform the problem into an equality problem on en bits
EQen, where e is the number of edges in the graph. Therefore NQ(EQG
n ) = en, that is,
the trivial protocol is optimal for bipartite graphs. On the other hand, if G contains an
odd cycle, then this argument fails. In the rest of this paper we will focus on the extreme
case of G being an odd cycle and investigate the complexity of the corresponding equality
problem.

Deﬁnition 17. The k-player cyclic equality problem on n bits EQCk

n is the function

n : ([2n]×[2n])k → {0, 1} : (a1b1, . . . , akbk) 7→(1 if b1 = a2, b2 = a3, . . . , bk = a1

0 otherwise,

EQCk

that is, the players are arranged in a circle; player i receives two n-bit inputs ai, bi and
has to decide whether ai = bi−1 and bi = ai+1, where the indices are taken modulo k.

It turns out that the tensor corresponding to this function is a generalisation of the
matrix multiplication tensor, one of the central objects of study in algebraic complexity

theory. This tensor arises as follows in algebraic complexity theory. Consider the bilinear
map

Cm×m × Cm×m → Cm×m : (A, B) 7→ AB

which multiplies two complex m×m matrices. Any bilinear map U ×V → W corresponds
canonically to a tensor in U ⊗ V ⊗ W . The number of multiplications in the ﬁeld C
necessary to perform the bilinear map is equal to the tensor rank of the corresponding
tensor, up to a factor 2. The tensor corresponding to the matrix multiplication map is

hm, m, mi := Xx∈[m]3

|x1x2i|x2x3i|x3x1i .

A natural generalisation of the tensor hm, m, mi to a k-party tensor is the so-called
iterated matrix multiplication tensor

IMMk

m := Xx∈[m]k

|x1x2i|x2x3i · · · |xkx1i .

Clearly, IMM3

m = hm, m, mi. The tensor IMMk

m corresponds to the multilinear map

(Cm×m)×k → C : (A1, A2, . . . , Ak) 7→ tr(A1A2 · · · Ak)

which computes the trace of the product of k matrices. We note that, when viewed as
a polynomial in the matrix entries, IMMk
m plays a special role in the ﬁeld of arithmetic
circuits and geometric complexity theory. Namely, IMMk
3 is complete for the class VPe of
families of polynomials computable by small formulas [BOC92], and IMMk
k is complete
for the class VQP, for which the determinant is also complete [Blä01]. The following
connection between iterated matrix multiplication and cyclic equality is readily observed.

Proposition 18. The tensor corresponding to the cyclic equality function EQCk
bits is the iterated matrix multiplication tensor IMMk

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the following four paragraphs
we do the following: (1) we show that in the classical model, the naïve protocol in which
every player broadcasts his input is optimal; (2) we show that when k is even the naïve
protocol is optimal quantumly; (3) we exhibit nontrivial protocols when n = 1 and k = 3
or k = 5; (4) we show nontrivial lower bounds on the quantum complexity by use of
Young ﬂattenings. Finally, in the last section, we show that the Strassen laser method
yields nontrivial protocols for all odd k ≥ 3, asymptotically.

Classical lower bound with the fooling set method. We will show that in the
classical situation the trivial protocol is always optimal. To prove a lower bound on the
classical complexity of the cyclic equality problem we use the fooling set method.

Proof. Let S ⊆ [22n]k be the set of 1-inputs of the function EQCk
n . This set has size 2kn.
Let Π be a classical protocol for EQCk
n and denote by Πr(x1, . . . , xk) the sequence of
messages sent by the players in the protocol Π on input x ∈ [22n]k and private random-
ness r ∈ [m]k. Suppose there are distinct 1-inputs x, y ∈ S and private randomnesses

10

r, s ∈ [m]k such that Πr(x1, . . . , xk) = Πs(y1, . . . , yk). There is an i such that xi 6= yi,
say i = 1. We have Πr(x1, . . . , xk) = Π(r1,s2,...,sk)(x1, y2, . . . , yk), so the protocol outputs
1 on input x1, y2, . . . , yk with randomness (r1, s2, . . . , sk). However, x1, y2, . . . , yk is a
0-input, a contradiction. Therefore, Πr(x1, . . . , xk) 6= Πs(y1, . . . , yk). We conclude that
N(EQCk

An even number of quantum players. When k is even, the cycle graph Ck is
bipartite, and, as mentioned above, the best protocol for an equality problem on a
bipartite graph is the trivial protocol. We record this statement in terms of border
support rank in the following proposition.

Quantum lower bound with Young ﬂattenings. Let t ∈ V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ V3 be some 3-
tensor. By grouping V1 and V2, the tensor t can be viewed as a matrix A ∈ (V1 ⊗V2)⊗V3;
this is called a ﬂattening. The rank of the ﬂattening A is a lower bound for the border
rank of t and thus we obtain lower bounds on the border rank of tensors by computing
the rank of their ﬂattenings. However, this type of lower bound can never be bigger
than the dimension of any local space Vi, and there do exist tensors with border rank
larger than the local dimensions, for example the matrix multiplication tensor h2, 2, 2i.
One approach to overcome this ‘local dimension limitation’ is as follows. We let
φ : V2 → W1 ⊗ W2 be a linear map such that R(φ(v)) ≤ e for all v ∈ V2. By applying φ
to the central tensor leg of t, we transform t into a 4-tensor s ∈ V1 ⊗ W1 ⊗ W2 ⊗ V3.
Next, we ﬂatten s to a matrix A ∈ (V1 ⊗ W1) ⊗ (W2 ⊗ V3). The rank of A divided by
e is a lower bound for the border rank of t. We will be using a speciﬁc linear map φ
which originates from the representation theory of the general linear group. When one
takes such representation theoretic maps φ to construct a ﬂattening as above one speaks
of a Young ﬂattening [LO11]. An early appearance of this type of ﬂattening can be
recognized in the work of Strassen [Str83]. The following lower bound is obtained with
a Young ﬂattening.

Proof. Let k = 3. The proof for odd k > 3 goes similarly after having grouped the k
parties appropriately to 3 parties. For a vector space V , let ∧aV be the ath exterior
power of V . Deﬁne the linear map

φ : C2n−1 → ∧pC2n−1 ⊗ ∧p+1C2n−1

⊗ Cn2
,

where i runs over [n]3 and the αi1,i2,i3 are nonzero complex numbers. The border rank
of t1 is at least the border rank of

αi1,i2,i3 |i1i2i |i2 + i3 − 1i |i3i1i ∈ Cn2

⊗ C2n−1 ⊗ Cn2
.

t2 :=Xi
A :=Xi Xj1<···<jp

Apply φ to the central tensor leg of t2 and then ﬂatten to obtain

αi1,i2,i3 |i1i2i |j1i∧· · ·∧|jpi ⊗ |j1i∧· · ·∧|jpi∧|i2 + i3 − 1i |i3i1i .

View A as a direct sum of n matrices Ai1 ∈ (Cn ⊗ ∧pC2n−1) ⊗ (∧p+1C2n−1 ⊗ Cn); the
matrix Ai1 corresponds to the linear map

fi1 := |i2i |j1i∧· · ·∧|jpi 7→Xi3

αi1,i2,i3 |j1i∧· · ·∧|jpi∧|i2 + i3 − 1i |i3i .

Let p = n − 1. We claim that every matrix Ai1 is upper triangular with elements αi1,i2,i3
on the diagonal, up to permutations of the rows and columns. Assuming the claim is

12

true, we get that R(A) = Pi1 R(Ai1) = n dim(Cn ⊗ ∧n−1C2n−1) = n2(cid:0)2n−1

implies the lower bound Rs(IMM3

n−1(cid:1). This

To prove this claim we deﬁne a partial order on the basis elements |j1i ∧ · · · ∧ |jni ⊗
|ℓi of the target space of Ai1. We will use the same partial order as Landsberg and
Michałek [LM16]. Denote the basis elements of the target space by (P, ℓ) with P an
n-subset of [2n − 1] and ℓ ∈ [n]. Let (P1, ℓ1) and (P2, ℓ2) be two such basis elements and
deﬁne ℓ := min(ℓ1, ℓ2). We say (P1, ℓ1) < (P2, ℓ2)

n) ≥ n2(cid:0)2n−1

1. if the ordered sequence of the ℓ smallest elements in P2 is lexicographically smaller

than the ordered sequence of the ℓ smallest elements in P1;

2. or if the sequences of ℓ smallest elements are equal and ℓ1 < ℓ2.

One checks that this deﬁnes a partial order and that the unique minimal element in this
order is ({n, . . . , 2n − 1}, 1). For example, with n = 2 the partial order has the following
Hasse diagram.

({1, 2}, 2)

({1, 3}, 2)

({1, 3}, 1)

({1, 2}, 1)

({2, 3}, 2)

({2, 3}, 1)

We prove the claim by induction on <, with the minimal element as a base case. For

now let all the αi1,i2,i3 be 1. First, under Ai1 we have

|ni ⊗ |n + 1i ∧ · · · ∧ |2n − 1i 7→ |ni ∧ · · · ∧ |2n − 1i ⊗ |1i ,

so the minimal element ({n, . . . , 2n − 1}, 1) is in the image of Ai1. Let (P, ℓ) be in the
target space of Ai1 and assume that every (P ′, ℓ′) with (P ′, ℓ′) < (P, ℓ) is in the image.
Write P = (p1, . . . , pn) with p1 ≤ · · · ≤ pn. Under Ai1 we have,

|p1i ∧ · · ·bpℓ · · · ∧ |pni ⊗ |1 + pℓ − ℓi 7→Xm

|p1i ∧ · · ·bpℓ · · · ∧ |pni ∧ |pℓ − ℓ + mi ⊗ |mi .

Taking m = ℓ, one sees that the basis element (P, ℓ) is present in the sum. Moreover,
for any other (P ′, m) appearing in the sum we have (P ′, m) < (P, ℓ). Indeed, if m > ℓ,
then pℓ − ℓ + m > pℓ, so the smallest ℓ elements in P ′ are lexicographically larger
than the smallest ℓ elements in P , meaning (P ′, m) < (P, ℓ) by rule 1; if m < ℓ, then
pm ≤ pℓ − ℓ + m < pℓ, so the m smallest elements of P ′ and P are equal, meaning
(P ′, m) < (P, ℓ) by rule 2. Therefore, the basis element (P, ℓ) is in the image. This
argument shows that Ai1 has full rank. Moreover, this argument shows that, up to
a permutation of the rows and columns, the matrix Ai1 is upper triangular with ones
on the diagonal. Repeating this argument with general values for αi1,i2,i3 proves the
claim.

Remark 23. The lower bound in Theorem 22 improves a lower bound of Ikenmeyer on
the border support rank of IMM3

n [Ike13, 8.2.17].

Asymptotically, we have NQ(EQCk

n ) ≤ ωs,k n+O(1) ≤ ωk n+O(1). The exponents ω3
and ωs,3 are known as ω and ωs in the literature. The support rank exponent of matrix
multiplication was ﬁrst studied by Cohn and Umans [CU13]. The best upper bound
on ωs comes from the upper bound ω ≤ 2.3728639 of Le Gall [LG14].
Interestingly,
Cohn and Umans show the relationship

ω ≤ (3ωs − 2)/2.

Therefore, one way of ﬁnding upper bounds on ω is to construct an eﬃcient quantum
communication protocol for the cyclic equality problem EQ3
n.

For any k we have k − 1 ≤ ωk ≤ k, and if k is even, then ωk = k (Proposition 20).

The aim of this section will be to show: if k ≥ 3 is odd, then

ωk < k.

In this section we will generalize some tools for obtaining
Schönhage τ -theorem.
upper bounds on the exponent of ω3 to all exponents ωk, in particular, we generalize the
Schönhage τ -theorem. The proofs in this section are straightforward generalizations of
the proofs for k = 3 which can be found in [Blä13]. In the next paragraph, we will use
Strassen’s laser method to show that ωk < k for all odd k.

First we recall an important relationship between border rank and rank. We use
the following more precise notion of border rank. Let h ∈ N and let t be a tensor
in C⊗m1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ C⊗mk . Deﬁne Rh(t) to be the minimum number r such that there
exist vectors vj
i = εht + O(εh+1). A well-
known but nontrivial result is that R(t) = minh Rh(t).
It is not hard to show that
Rh+h′(t ⊗ t′) ≤ Rh(t) Rh′(t′). The relationship we are talking about is the following.

i ∈ (C[ε])mj that satisfy Pr

i ⊗ · · · ⊗ vk

i=1 v1

Proposition 25. For every h, k ∈ N, there is a number ch such that for all tensors
t ∈ Cm1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Cmk , R(t) ≤ ch Rh(t). The number ch depends polynomially on h.
Proof. Let t be a tensor in Cm1 ⊗· · ·⊗Cmk with Rh(t) = r. Then there are vj
such that

i ∈ (C[ε])mj

i = εht + O(εh+1).

i =Ph

i (a1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ vk

i (ak) = εht + O(εh+1).

Taking only the summands such that a1 + · · · + ak = h gives a rank decomposition of t.

Next, we show that an upper bound on the border rank of ‘unbalanced’ iterated

matrix multiplication tensors yields and upper bound on ωk.

Proposition 26. If R(hn1, n2, . . . , nki) ≤ r, then ωk ≤ k logn1···nk r.

Proof. Let N = n1 · · · nk. There is an h such that Rh(hn1, . . . , nki) ≤ r. By taking
the tensor product of all cyclic shifts of hn1, . . . , nki, we get Rkh(hN, . . . , N i) ≤ rk and
thus Rkhs(hN s, . . . , N si) ≤ rks for all s. Hence R(hN s, . . . , N si) ≤ ckhsrks for some
number ckhs which is constant in N . Therefore,

ω ≤ logN s(ckhsrks) = ks logN s(r) + logN s(ckhs).

If s goes to inﬁnity then logN s(ckhs) goes to zero, so ωk ≤ k logN (r).

The real workhorse is the following straightforward generalization of a theorem of

Schönhage [Sch81].

Proposition 27 (k-party Schönhage τ -theorem). Suppose that r > p and

We follow the proof of [Blä13]. We ﬁrst prove two lemmas. For tensors s, t ∈
Cm1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Cmk , let s ≤ t denote the existence of an SLOCC transformation mapping
t to s. Let a, b ∈ N + 1.

Lemma 28. Let t be a tensor such that R(t⊕a) ≤ b. Then for all s, R((t⊗s)⊕a) ≤
⌈b/a⌉sa.

Proof. We prove the lemma by induction over s. The base case s = 1 follows from the
assumption. For the induction step, we have

(t⊗s+1)⊕a = t⊕a ⊗ t⊗s ≤ GHZb ⊗ t⊗s = (t⊗s)⊕b,

and thus, by the induction hypothesis,

R((t⊗s+1)⊕a) ≤ R((t⊗s)⊕b) ≤ R((t⊗s)⊕(⌈b/a⌉a)) ≤ ⌈ b

Proof. Let φ be the map |abi 7→ δ[a=b] |ai. Apply φ⊗5 to h2, 2, 2, 2, 2i. This yields one
copy of GHZ[5]

Remark 33. We mention that the subrank result of Proposition 32 can by improved
asymptotically in the sense that rate ω(h2, 2, 2, 2, 2i, GHZ5) = 1/2 [VC16]. Using this
fact in the proof of Theorem 30 gives the slightly better upper bound ωk ≤ logq((q +
1)k/4).

For the proof of Theorem 30 we have to deﬁne the notion of the decomposition of
the support of a tensor and the corresponding inner and outer structure of a tensor. Let
I1, . . . , Ik be ﬁnite sets. A decomposition D of I1 × · · · × Ik is a collection of sets I j
i such
that

Ii =Gj

I j
i ,

i = ∅ and ∪jI j

meaning that for every i, ∩jI j
i = Ii. Let t be a tensor in Cm1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Cmk
and index the basis elements in this space by elements of [m1] × · · · × [mk]. Let D be a
decomposition of [m1] × · · · × [mk]. We view D as a ‘cut’ of [m1] × · · · × [mk] into smaller
product sets and thus as a ‘cut’ of t into smaller tensors. We deﬁne t|
to be
I
the restriction of t to the basis elements in I j1
k . These smaller tensors we
think of as the ‘inner structure’ of t. We deﬁne the ‘outer structure’ of t with respect to
D to be the tensor tD indexed by sequences (j1, . . . , jk) such that tD has a 1 at position
(j1, . . . , jk) if t restricted to I j1

k is not the zero tensor, and a 0 otherwise.

q)D = |11000i + |01100i ∼= |10100i + |00000i. Note that
i=1 |ii000i
i=1 |0ii00i, which are also known as h1, q, 1, 1, 1i and h1, 1, q, 1, 1i. Let Cyc5 be
the map t 7→ t ⊗ σt ⊗ σ2t ⊗ σ3t ⊗ σ4t with σ = (12345). Let ˆD = Cyc5 D be the naturally
corresponding decomposition. Then

this is just an EPR pair between party 1 and 3. The inner structures arePq
and Pq

h2, 2, 2, 2, 2i⊗s = (Cyc5 Str5

q)⊗s
ˆD⊗s

and R(cid:0)(Cyc5 Str5

q)⊗s(cid:1) ≤ (q + 1)5s.

Note how the ﬁrst statement relies on 5 being odd.

The inner structure of (Cyc5 Str5

q)⊗s

ˆD⊗s consists of tensors from I := {hn1, n2, n3, n4, n5i |

n1 · · · n5 = q5s}. Combining equation (1) with Proposition 32 gives that there are 2s
elements t1, t2, . . . ∈ I such that

R(t1 ⊕ t2 ⊕ · · · ) ≤ (q + 1)5s.

Now the τ -theorem says that if we deﬁne τ by

then ω5 ≤ 5τ . Therefore,

2s(q5s)τ = (q + 1)5s

ω5 ≤ 5τ ≤ logq

(q + 1)5

which gives ω5 ≤ 4.84438. In general, one gets ωk ≤ logq
than k for q large enough.

(q+1)k

which is strictly smaller
