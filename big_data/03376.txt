We theoretically consider the superconductivity of the topological half-Heusler semimetals YPtBi
and LuPtBi. We show that pairing occurs between j = 3/2 fermion states, which leads to qualitative
diﬀerences from the conventional theory of pairing between j = 1/2 states.
In particular, this
permits Cooper pairs with quintet or septet total angular momentum, in addition to the usual
singlet and triplet states. Purely on-site interactions can generate s-wave quintet time-reversal
symmetry-breaking states with topologically nontrivial point or line nodes. These local s-wave
quintet pairs reveal themselves as d-wave states in momentum space. Furthermore, due to the
broken inversion symmetry in these materials, the s-wave singlet state can mix with a p-wave septet
state, again with topologically-stable line nodes. Our analysis lays the foundation for understanding
the unconventional superconductivity of the half-Heuslers.

The concept of topological order is now ﬁrmly estab-
lished as a key characteristic of condensed matter sys-
tems. Although fundamentally diﬀerent from sponta-
neous symmetry-breaking order, there is much interest
in whether a nontrivial relationship between the two ex-
ists. A materials class in which to systematically explore
this interplay are the ternary half-Heusler compounds,
in particular RPtBi and RPdBi, where R is a rare earth.
Many of these systems are predicted to show an inver-
sion between the p-orbital-derived j = 3/2 Γ8 and the
s-orbital-derived j = 1/2 Γ6 bands [1], a precondition for
a topological insulator state. These half-Heuslers also
display symmetry-broken ground states: Most are either
antiferromagnetic [2, 3] or superconducting [4, 6, 7], or
show a coexistence of the two [3, 8, 9]. Excitingly, there
is now compelling evidence that the superconductivity of
YPtBi is unconventional: Upper critical ﬁeld measure-
ments are inconsistent with singlet pairing [7], while the
low-temperature penetration depth indicates the pres-
ence of line nodes [11]. A surface nodal superconducting
state in LuPtBi with a Tc signiﬁcantly higher than in the
bulk has also been reported [12].

The band inversion predicted for YPtBi and LuPtBi
implies a fundamental diﬀerence from most other super-
conductors:
In these materials, the chemical potential
lies close to the four-fold degeneracy point of the Γ8
band, and a microscopic theory of the superconductiv-
ity must therefore describe the pairing between j = 3/2
fermions. This is highly unusual, since the four-fold de-
generacy is typically split by crystal ﬁelds and spin-orbit
interactions to the two-fold degeneracy dictated by parity
and time-reversal symmetries, yielding the conventional
pseudospin-1/2 description of Cooper pairing.

In this Letter we investigate the possible superconduct-

ing states of YPtBi and LuPtBi. Our starting point is
a generic k · p model for the low-energy states of the
Γ8 band, which qualitatively captures the ab initio band
structure. Although both symmetric (SSOC) and anti-
symmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) lift the four-fold
degeneracy away from the Γ point, the electronic states
nevertheless maintain their j = 3/2 character. This has
important consequences for the superconductivity.
In
particular, there are six distinct on-site pairing states:
one corresponds to the conventional J = 0 singlet solu-
tion, while the other ﬁve are J = 2 quintet states. Pairing
in the latter channels generically leads to nodal time-
reversal symmetry-breaking (TRSB) states, but strongly
depends upon the SSOC. Due to the absence of cen-
trosymmetry, the on-site singlet solution can mix with
a p-wave J = 3 septet state, potentially yielding a nodal
gap which is insensitive to the pair-breaking eﬀect of the
ASOC. The essential role of spin-orbit coupling in se-
lecting the pairing state has been overlooked in previous
works [13], which examined pairing in j = 3/2 bands in
the context of realizing topological surface states. Such
considerations also do not arise in the pairing of spin-3/2
particles in cold atomic gases [14]. Our work therefore
lays the foundation for understanding the superconduc-
tivity of topological half-Heusler compounds.

Generic k·p model for half-Heusler semimetals—Band
structure calculations for YPtBi and LuPtBi indicate
that the electronic states near the chemical potential
arise from the j = 3/2 Γ8 representation, where the
j = 3/2 total angular momentum is due to the spin-
orbit coupling of spin s = 1/2 electrons in l = 1 p-
orbitals of Bi.
In Fig. 5 we compare ab initio predic-
tions for the Γ8 band in YPtBi. We note that the band
structure calculated using diﬀerent exchange correlation

tions close to the Γ point. The dotted line indicates the Fermi

potentials diﬀer to some degree [1, 15].
In particular,
whereas the local-density approximation (LDA) predicts
a compensated semimetal, the modiﬁed Becke and John-
son potential (MBJLDA) yields a zero band-gap semi-
conductor. The two schemes are in much better agree-
ment for LuPtBi [15]. Further details of the ab initio
calculations, including hybrid HSE06 functional results
conﬁrming the band inversion, are given in the supple-
mental material [15]. In either case it is possible to model
the band structure near the Γ point with a k · p theory.
Such a theory was originally discussed by Dresselhaus [2];
up to quadratic order in k the single-particle Hamiltonian
is

where i = x, y, z and i + 1 = y if i = x, etc., and ˇJi are
4 × 4 matrices corresponding to the angular momentum
operators for j = 3/2. The ﬁrst line of Eq. (13) is the
Luttinger-Kohn model, which is invariant under inver-

2

sion and involves SSOC terms proportional to β and γ.
The second line is odd under inversion and generalizes the
ASOC discussed in the context of j = 1/2 noncentrosym-
metric superconductors [17]. This model, supplemented
by higher-order terms, can quantitatively reproduce the
full range of band structure predictions [15].

It is not generally possible to analytically diagonal-
ize the Hamiltonian (13). For our analysis of the su-
perconductivity, however, we only require an eﬀective
low-energy model valid close to the Fermi surface. We
obtain this by treating the ASOC as a perturbation of
the Luttinger-Kohn bands, which is justiﬁed when the
characteristic ASOC energy ∼ δkF is small compared to
the chemical potential measured from the four-fold de-
generacy point. Experiments showing a low density of
hole carriers [6, 7], and the predicted very weak ASOC
splitting, are consistent with this condition.

The eigenstates of the Luttinger-Kohn model are dou-
bly degenerate and can be labelled by pseudospin-1/2
indices. The dispersions are given by

We now include the ASOC as a ﬁrst-order perturbation

where P± projects into the pseudospin states of the k,±

with the ASOC set to zero, and ˆsµ are the Pauli matrices
for the pseudospin. The vector gk,± = −g−k,± repre-
sents the eﬀective ASOC in the pseudospin-1/2 basis of
the band k,±. While the orientation of gk,± depends on
the arbitrary choice of pseudospin basis, the magnitude
of gk,± is independent of this choice and can be written

In the usual j = 1/2
case, however, symmetry dictates that the ASOC must
vanish along this direction [17]; the spin-orbit splitting
of one of the bands therefore reﬂects the presence of
j = 3/2 physics even in our eﬀective pseudospin-1/2 de-

scription. The eﬀective Hamiltonians (3) can be read-
ily diagonalized and yield the dispersions Ek,η=±,ν=± =
k,η + ν|gk,η|, where the values of η and ν are indepen-
dent of one another. As shown in Fig. 2(a), this approx-
imate dispersion is in excellent agreement with the full
numerical solution of the k · p Hamiltonian, and yields
typical spin-orbit split holelike Fermi surfaces plotted

It is instructive to project the ∆j,j(cid:48) into the pseudospin
basis of the k,± bands, ∆eﬀ,±(k) = P±U†∆U∗P±. In all

which is characterized by the three-component order pa-
rameter l = (l1, l2, l3). The eﬀective gaps of the quintet
pairing states have d-wave form factors, which reﬂects the
J = 2 total angular momentum of the Cooper pairs. The
d-wave symmetry is therefore a robust result, and does
not depend on the speciﬁc parameters of our k· p Hamil-
tonian. Before discussing each of these cases in detail,
we note an important property of the E and T2 states:
The eﬀective gaps, and therefore Tc, depend strongly on
the SSOC terms in Eq. (13). Speciﬁcally, the eﬀective
gap for the E states is vanishing unless β (cid:54)= 0, while the
T2 states only open a gap at the Fermi surface if γ (cid:54)= 0.
Consequently, a spatial variation of the spin-orbit cou-
pling (as might appear near surfaces or interfaces) can
dramatically change Tc for these solutions. We speculate
that this may explain the enhanced Tc observed at the
surface of LuPtBi [12].

The A1 pairing state—The on-site pairing in the A1
channel corresponds to the conventional isotropic s-wave
singlet state. It is therefore interesting to consider the ef-
fect of the broken inversion symmetry, which in j = 1/2
noncentrosymmetric superconductors generates a mixed-
parity state with both singlet and triplet pairing [18].
For Td symmetry, the lowest orbital-angular-momentum
A1 triplet state is f -wave, which for small k gives gap
functions on the two spin-split j = 1/2 Fermi surfaces
∆(k) = ∆s ± ∆f
i+2)2. This state ex-
hibits line nodes if the f -wave triplet gap ∆f is larger
than the s-wave singlet gap ∆s. However, dominant f -
wave symmetry of the Cooper pairs is highly unlikely
if quasi-local interactions give rise to superconductiv-
ity [23]; such interactions would more plausibly give rise
to a p-wave state. For the j = 3/2 case considered here,
however, a p-wave state with A1 symmetry exists: In the

Superconductivity—In the conventional theory of su-
perconductivity, a Cooper pair constructed from two
j = 1/2 fermions has either total angular momentum
J = 0 (singlet) or J = 1 (triplet), which by fermion an-
tisymmetry correspond to even- and odd-parity orbital
states, respectively. For the pairing of the j = 3/2 states
in the half-Heuslers, however, we must additionally allow
for J = 2 (quintet) and J = 3 (septet) pairing, again
corresponding to even- and odd-parity orbital wavefunc-
tions. These extra pairing channels already manifest
themselves in an expanded variety of on-site (s-wave)
pairing: While there is a single J = 0 state, there are ﬁve
distinct types of on-site Cooper pair with J = 2. The six

l = (1,−e2πi/3, e4πi/3). The color indicates the phase while
the saturation gives the gap magnitude. Black points or lines
indicate nodes of the gap.

The T2 pairing state—The gap function for T2 pair-
ing is controlled by the three-dimensional order param-
eter l = (l1, l2, l3).
Similar to the E pairing state,
the free energy expansion for the T2 pairing in the Td
point group is identical to that for T2g pairing in the
point group Oh [19], i.e. fT2 = αl · l∗ + β1(l · l∗)2 +
β2|l · l|2 + β3(|l1|2|l2|2 + |l1|2|l3|2 + |l3|2|l2|2). This ad-
mits four distinct ground states: l = (1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1),
(1, e2πi/3, e4πi/3), or (1, i, 0). Again assuming weak cou-
pling, the parameters in the free energy expansion satisfy
β1 > 0, β2 > 0, and β3 = 2β2−β1, which implies that one
of the two TRSB states is realized. The particular state
depends on the detailed form of the gap basis functions
and the shape of the Fermi surface. We plot the corre-
sponding eﬀective gaps in Fig. 4(b) and (c). Both these
gaps have interesting topological properties and surface
states [20]. Given that line nodes have been observed,
the l = (1, i, 0) solution is of particular interest.

Conclusions—In this Letter we have investigated pos-
sible pairing states of the unconventional noncentrosym-
metric superconductors YPtBi and LuPtBi. The inverted
band structures of these topological semimetals implies
pairing of j = 3/2 fermions, permitting Cooper pairs in a
quintet or septet total angular momentum state. On-site
quintet pairing generically leads to nodal TRSB super-
conducting states, which could be detected by magneto-
optical Kerr eﬀect or µSR measurements. Alternatively,
a nodal time-reversal symmetric gap can arise from the

where k± = kx ± iky. This constitutes a septet pair-
ing state with total J = 3. Projecting the gap into
the eﬀective pseudospin-1/2 bands, we ﬁnd that ∆eﬀ,± =
(dk,± · ˆs)iˆsy = (∆p/δ)(gk,± · ˆs)iˆsy, i.e. the d-vector of
the eﬀective pseudospin-triplet state is parallel to the ef-
fective ASOC vector gk,±. As pointed out in Ref. [18],
this alignment makes the gap ∆eﬀ,± immune to the pair-
breaking eﬀect of the ASOC; for suﬃciently large ASOC,
it is the only stable odd-parity gap. Importantly, when
mixed with a subdominant s-wave singlet state, the re-
sulting gap displays line nodes on one of the spin-split
Fermi surfaces, as shown in Fig. 3. These nodes are
topologically protected and lead to zero-energy ﬂat band
surface states [20].

The E pairing state—The properties of the E super-
conducting state depends upon the two-dimensional or-
der parameter η = (η1, η2). The free energy expansion
for the E pairing state in point group Td is the same as
that for an Eg state in point group Oh [19], from which
we deduce fE = αη · η∗ + β1(η · η∗)2 + β2(η1η∗
1)2.
In general there are three ground states: η = (1, 0),
(0, 1), and (1, i).
In the weak-coupling limit we ﬁnd
β1 = 3β2 > 0 independent of the particular form of the
gap basis functions or the shape of the Fermi surface,
ensuring that the TRSB state η = (1, i) is most stable.
The eﬀective gap, shown in Fig. 4(a), has topologically-
protected Weyl point nodes that generate arc surface
states [20]. Although point nodes at ﬁrst seem incon-
sistent with the observation of line nodes, it is possible
that a point node state with impurities resembles a clean
line node state [21, 22], and hence it cannot be excluded
as a possible pairing state in YPtBi.

admixture of a p-wave septet state with an on-site singlet
state. Spin-orbit coupling strongly inﬂuences the stabil-
ity of these states. The similar electronic structure of the
topological half-Heusler compounds makes our analysis
relevant to the superconductivity of the entire materials
class. Although we have not considered a pairing mecha-
nism, the low carrier density makes a conventional Eliash-
berg theory unlikely [24]. We note that pairing of j = 3/2
fermions is not necessarily limited to the half-Heuslers:
the four-fold degeneracy of the Γ8 bands also occurs in
materials with O, T , and Oh point group symmetries,
permitting the exotic superconducting states discussed
here.

DERIVATION OF THE k · p HAMILTONIAN

6

The bands near the Γ point are derived from the Γ8 representation. A basis for this representation consists of the
four the total angular momentum j = 3/2 states |3/2, m(cid:105) with m = 3/2, 1/2,−1/2,−3/2 [1]. To construct a k · p
theory we need the sixteen operators that span the direct product space of Γ8 ⊗ Γ8. This can be conveniently done
using powers of the j = 3/2 operators ˇJi which we list here in the {|3/2, 3/2(cid:105),|3/2, 1/2(cid:105),|3/2,−1/2(cid:105),|3/2,−3/2(cid:105)}

In particular, the relevant products can be constructed using the well known relationship for spherical symmetry
3/2⊗ 3/2 = 3⊕ 2⊕ 1⊕ 0 and then decomposing the total j states into tetrahedral representations. Using the character
table for the tetrahedral group Td given in Table II, we ﬁnd: j = 0 → A1, j = 1 → T1, j = 2 → E ⊕ T2, and
j = 3 → A2 ⊕ T1 ⊕ T2. The corresponding operators are given in Table III. In Table III, we also give basis functions
for the diﬀerent tetrahedral representations for all power of ki up to the third power.
By forming all possible invariants from these powers of ki and the operators that span Γ8 ⊗ Γ8, we arrive at the

DETERMINATION OF THE k · p HAMILTONIAN FROM BAND STRUCTURES

7

The band structures of YPtBi and LuPtBi, including spin-orbit coupling, were calculated using several diﬀerent ap-
proximations for exchange-correlation: (i) the standard PBE generalized gradient approximation parameterization[3]
(also referred to as “LDA”); (ii) the modiﬁed Becke-Johnson LDA [4] potential that was developed to yield band gaps
in better agreement with experiment for a wide class of materials; and the HSE06 hybrid functional [5] which includes
a fraction (0.25) of exact exchange. For the MBJLDA, α=0.012 and β=1.023 as given in Ref. [4] were used.

In Fig. 5 we show the MBJLDA and LDA/GGA results for the Γ8 bands of LuPtBi; the corresponding plot for
YPtBi is shown in the main paper. Although there are diﬀerences in details that show up in the ﬁtting parameters,
the band topology is similar. Figure 6 compares the LDA/GGA bands to hybrid functional ones over a larger energy
range, demonstrating that the band ordering is the same for all the diﬀerent exchange-correlation choices with the
Γ8 states near the chemical potential. This result is not surprising since simple tight-binding arguments (without
spin-orbit) predict that half-Heusler compounds with 18 valence electrons are (nearly zero-gap) semiconductors with
the 6-fold Γ15 (3-dimensional representation × 2 for spin) state at/near EF . Inclusion of spin-orbit does not alter this
picture: Spin-orbit pushes the 2-fold Γ7 state (with its downward dispersing bands) to lower energy, while the 4-fold
Γ8 states remain near EF . Thus, although there are diﬀerences in the band dispersions, the overall band topologies
are the same. In particular, any reasonable calculation of these half-Heusler materials will lead to the j = 3/2 Γ8
states near the chemical potential, which is the essential aspect needed for the superconductivity discussed here.

In the following we carry out detailed ﬁts to only the MBJLDA and LDA results. The two schemes are in much
better agreement for LuPtBi than for YPtBi (shown in the main paper). From ﬁtting the band structures near the Γ
point we can extract the parameters in the k·p Hamiltonian. To carry out these ﬁts, we ﬁrst extracted the parameters
α, β, γ, and δ. We found that we needed to also include the cubic term 1 to correctly model the bands in the (1, 1, 0)
direction. The other cubic parameters we set to zero. The resultant parameters are given in Table IV. In addition,
we note that the inclusion of quartic terms is required to capture an additional electron pocket that appears near the
calculated Fermi energy for some of the density functional calculations. Early experimental results suggest that these
materials are hole doped [6, 7], so it is likely that this electron Fermi surface does not appear in the superconducting
materials. However, we note that our main results: the appearance of nodal broken time-reversal d-wave quintet
pairing states and the existence of a mixed s-wave singlet and p-wave septet state with topologically protected line
nodes are not aﬀected by this additional electron pocket.
