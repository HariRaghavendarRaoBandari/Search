CONTINUUM EIGENMODES IN SOME LINEAR STELLAR

MODELS

CHRISTOPHER J. WINFIELD

Abstract. We apply parallel approaches in the study of continuous spec-
tra to adiabatic stellar models. We seek continuum eigenmodes for the
LAWE formulated as both ﬁnite diﬀerence and linear diﬀerential equa-
tions.
In particular, we apply methods of Jacobi matrices and methods
of subordinancy theory in these respective formulations. We ﬁnd certain
pressure-density conditions which admit positive-measured sets of continu-
ous oscillation spectra under plausible conditions on density and pressure.
We arrive at results of unbounded oscillations and computational or, per-
haps, dynamic instability.

Introduction

The problem of radial, adiabatic (isentropic) stellar oscillations is well studied
in cases where discrete eigenmodes are calculated in the frameworks of linearized
diﬀerential equations and in parallel applications of operator theory (see, for
instance, [2, 3, 9, 22]).1 However, continuous eigenvalues, although previously
suggested in the general literature, are typically absent, either excluded from
particular physical models or explicitly avoided to assure dynamic or numerical
stability [4, 14, 17, 23] (see also the Appendix of [6]). In this article we investigate
some cases where continuous spectra are present which have ramiﬁcations on the
associated motion - and perhaps on the perturbation method itself. Our study
involves linearized perturbations of the diﬀerential system

Here, m = M(r) is total mass measured from the origin to distance r from the
center of a spherically symmetric star, and P and ρ are pressure and density,
respectively, depending on r. Moreover, the diﬀerential mass dm is interpreted
as that of a spherical mass shell (or mass element) with mean radius r about

adiabatic wave equation.

the origin. We suppose, 0 < r ≤ R∗, 0 ≤ M ≤ M∗ where R∗ and M∗ are
ﬁxed (arbitrary) positive constants; and, we consider only shell models where
r is conﬁned to intervals of the form [R∗ − δ, R∗] for some ﬁxed, but arbitrary,
0 < δ < R∗.
In our study we adopt a background model where hydrostatic equilibrium
(HSE) holds approximately, which of course is a standing assumption of the
LAWE. We consider various adiabatic, polytropic and non-polytropic, equations
of state (EOS): By ’polytropic’ we mean that pressure is a power function of
density (not to be confused with ’polytrope’, a solution of the Lane-Emden equa-
tion). We ﬁnd that rigorous analysis has indeed been done [3, 4] along these
lines with conditions that ensure pure-point spectra and, hence, discrete radial
motion analogous to standing waves. These conditions include those where HSE
holds exactly on neighborhoods of shell boundaries. Most of our models likewise
impose some exact HSE conditions, but, in contrast, only as a boundary condi-
tion at the outer surface. For our classes of polytropic EOS we instead obtain
continuous spectra for operators deﬁned on radial intervals away from the origin
with mass density functions satisfying ρ(r) ∝ (R∗ − r)a, a > 1 (in stark contrast
to Section 4, [23] which places extreme mass concentration at the stellar center).
The general approach of this article is as follows: Our study of eigenvalues
ﬁrst arises after linearization and discretization of the system (0.1) whereby a
change of variables converts a ﬁnite diﬀerence equation into an eigenvalue prob-
lem (A − λ) ~X = ~0, a problem typically left to computation involving large but
ﬁnite matrices A (cf.
[6, 9]). We ﬁnd, however, that the adiabatic case admits
tri-diagonal A’s which lend themselves to analysis of Jacobi matrices after pass-
ing to an inﬁnite system: Here, we impose non-uniform partitions which we let
cluster at the stellar surface r = R∗. In this context one turns to a large body of
mathematical work on the inﬁnite (cf. [16, 21]) Jacobi matrix. Indeed, cases of
continuous spectra as well as discrete spectra are well known whereby unbounded
oscillations modes can be discerned in this application by the nature of the spec-
tra. We then pass to second-order ordinary diﬀerential equation models, applying
various results arising from subordinancy theory [12, 18] and (Weyl) limit-point
case Sturm-Liouville operators [8, 20, 24]. The author is not aware if such os-
cillation behavior is actually observed in stars. Perhaps, the properties studied
here are merely artifacts of the perturbation methods and yet prove absent in
more complete, non-linear methods or in simple models which (say) incorporate
non-adiabatic or stochastic processes.

This article is organized as follows: In Section 1 we formulate our ﬁnite dif-
ference equation and place it in a Jacobi-matrix format. In Section 2 we apply
results from certain Hilbert-Schmidt and trace-class operators to arrive at gen-
eral results on spectra and solutions. In Section 3 we study non-polytropic cases
where absolutely continuous spectra are present and further develop some cases
where pure-point spectra also appear.
In Section 4 we reformulate and study

2

the matrix equation in some polytropic cases. Then, in Section 5 we present the
diﬀerential equation form of the LAWE in Sturm-Liouville (SL) form. Finally, in
Sections 6 and 7 we revisit polytropic and non-polytropic cases, respectively, in
the SL context.

1. The Difference Equation

To begin this section we outline a derivation of our ﬁnite diﬀerence equation
and the perturbation scheme involved which follow from [6, 9]2. For the system
(0.1) we suppose that m = M(r) is a strictly increasing function and treat m
as an independent variable. Then, one replaces r, P and ρ by the perturbed
quantities r(m) + δr(m, t), P (r, ρ) + δP (r, t), and ρ(r) + δρ(r, t), respectively.
One perturbs the system about HSE where

and replace δr(m, t) → eiωtδr(m) : Here,

tion, we introduce mass elements M (I) def= M(I) − M(I − 1) and set M(I) def=

−(ΓP R2)(I) · X(I + 1) − (ΓP R1)(I − 1) · X(I − 1)

and adopting some notation of [6], we arrive at our eigenvalue problem

(1.3)

λX(I) = G1(I)X(I − 1) + G2(I)X(I) + G3(I)X(I + 1)

[13]) which is irrelevant to our study, given monotonically decreasing M (I).

In our sign convention, λ > 0 would correspond to exponential time dependence.3
We note that this model is also simpliﬁed by an assumption of constant entropy
and that the equations decouple from dependence on temperature, opacity, and
luminosity, the admission of which would lead to larger systems and much greater
complexity (cf. Section 9, [15]). Moreover, we note that P can represent pressure
from various sources - not simply mechanical - and can involve temperature and
chemical variation. Indeed, such eﬀects could conceivably be incorporated in a
quasi-static EOS with P having dependence on r as well as ρ.

where we set ~X = (X(1), X(2), . . .) for X(I) = δr(I)pM (I). More generally, we

let ~X denote the function (or vector) deﬁned on Z+ given by the corresponding
assignments (components) X(I) : I = 1, 2, . . . and likewise deﬁne ~P , ~δr, ~ρ, etc.

in Sections 8.7 and 8.8 of [9].

Now, let J0 denote the tri-diagonal matrix in the form (2.1) but with ci = 1, ai = 0
∀i and let constants denote scalar multiplication. It is immediate that A− z − J0
is compact, whereby the essential spectrum of A is that of z + J0 (see [21]). More
precise information is obtained in the literature depending on whether A− z− J0
is of Hilbert-Schmidt class, whereby

or of slightly more rapid convergence, such as

We note the following: The mode of convergence of G1(I), G2(I) will depend
on P, ρ and M and how they are inter-related; these conditions may be imposed
via mass conservation together with, as we will show, an equation of state. Such
modes can imply various spectral properties of A which in turn have implications
on associated solutions A ~X = λ ~X (cf.
[12, 20]). Although this approach does
not typically yield precise estimates of X(I) (especially when mixtures of spectral
types are possible), asymptotic (Jost) estimates in some cases do indeed obtain
and, in turn, lead to estimates of δr(I).

Our main results depend on the following well known results which we list

together in

5

Theorem 2.2. (Previously Known) Suppose r(I) : I = 1, 2, . . . is a monotoni-
cally increasing sequence where limI→∞ r(I) = R < ∞ and let ~M ∈ ℓ1(Z+) with
M (I) > 0 ∀I. Then,

i) if (2.2) holds, then σess, essential spectrum, satisﬁes

ii) if (2.3) holds, then the pure-point spectra Ek : k = 1, 2, . . . such that

σess(A) = [z − 2, z + 2];

|Ek − z| > 2 (perhaps none, ﬁnitely or inﬁnitely many) of A satisfy

(||Ek − z| − 2|)3/2 < ∞;

Xk

iii) if (2.4) holds, then σac(A) = [z − 2, z + 2] and, the pure point spectrum

σpp satisﬁes

σpp(A)\(z − 2, z + 2) = ∅

which is to say that no ℓ2 eigenvalues exist in (z − 2, z + 2);

iv) ﬁnally, if (2.5) holds, then z ± 2 /∈ σpp(A) hold along with iii).
We make several remarks: Statement i) follows from a routine application
(see [21]) of the Weyl Invariance theorem, noting that A − z − J0 is compact.
Statement ii) is one of several criteria (see Theorem 1 [16] or Theorem 1.10.1
[21]) which together are equivalent to A − z − J0 being of Hilbert-Schmidt class.
Statements iii) and iv) follow from Theorem A.6 [11] (see also [20]). The abso-
lutely continuous part f (x)dx of the implied spectral measure is supported on
[z − 2, z + 2], the positivity of which is demonstrated by a ﬁnite lower bound on
a weighted Lebesgue integral of log |f (x)| (the so-called Quasi-Szeg¨o condition);
indeed, in case iii) an even stricter integral condition (the Szeg¨o condition) on
f (x) also holds (see [16, 21]).

We introduce notation to indicate various modes of convergence of sequences:

Oℓp→ L means that limI→∞ a(I) = L and that for b(I) =
The expression a(I)
a(I) − L the sequence satisﬁes ~b ∈ ℓp(Z+). For example, a geometric sequence
Oℓ1→ ||~a||ℓ1 . We will need to
a(I) = CηI with ﬁxed C and |η| < 1 satisﬁes a(I)
establish
Oℓp→ La
Proposition 2.3. For sequences ~a and ~b suppose for some p ≥ 1 that a(I)
Oℓp→ LaLb. Moreover,
and b(I)
f (aI)
Proof. If either La or Lb are zero, the ﬁrst result is clear since both ~a and ~b are
bounded. If both La or Lb are non-zero, then by scaling arguments, it will suﬃce
to prove the result for La = Lb = 1. We write

Oℓp→ Lb for some constants La, Lb. Then, a(I)b(I)

Oℓp→ f (La) for any Lipshitz function f.

(2.6)

a(I)b(I) − 1 = (a(I) − 1)(b(I) + 1) + (b(I) − 1) − (a(I) − 1).

6

From standard ℓp inequalities we ﬁnd that the left-hand side of (2.6) deﬁnes a
sequence in ℓp(Z+). The last statement is clear since |f (aI )−f (L)|p ≤ (c|aI−L|)p
for some constant c ≥ 0.
(cid:3)

Our examples in the discrete-systems case will involve mass distributions of

the form

(2.7)

M (I + 1) = ηγM (I); r(I) = R∗ · (1 − ηI )

for ﬁxed 0 < η < 1 and γ > 0, in which case

M(I) = (1 − ηγ)M∗

ηγj = M∗(1 − ηγ(I+1)).

to introduce 4

4See equation (8.20) and following discussion [6] for physical interpretation of quantities

Now, the result follows by applying Proposition 2.3 and Theorem 2.2 and a scaling
argument. The remaining claim follows as above, mutatis-mutandis with (2.13)
in Oℓ1 mode.
(cid:3)

We remark: The spectrum depends on the partition {r(I)|I = 1, 2, . . .}; and,
if the convergence of (2.13) is in Oℓ1 mode, the solutions ~Xλ to A ~X = λ ~X for λ ∈
I ◦ are complex linear combinations of vectors ~Y± (Jost solutions [21]) satisfying
(2.14)
(as I → ∞) for θ = arccos [(λ + ζΛ∗)/(2Λ∗κ)] .

~Y±(I) = e±iθI (1 + o(1))

3. Some Non-polytropic Cases

We ﬁnd natural examples where the assignments ~M and ~r determine ~ρ by
mass conservation. Here, and until otherwise speciﬁed, we will suppose that
HSE holds exactly at the surface r = R∗. However, we do not at this point
assign an equation of state nor any explicit dependence of P on ρ. In the general
case we suppose it plausible that ΓP depends on ρ and other parameters which,
in turn, may vary with r as well (see [15] and sections 4.2b and 8.7 of [9]). We will
denote ~D : D(I) = (ΓP ρ)(I) which we will call a pressure-density distribution;
and, we will call a correspondence between the assignments ~M, ~r, such as (2.7)
a mass distribution. We will also say that ~D is admissible if (0.1) holds and if
(1.1) holds but in the limit as I → ∞, each in the discrete sense. We state
Proposition 3.1. Let ~D be an admissible pressure-density distribution such that

(3.1)

Γ(I)ρ(I)

M (I)

Oℓ1→

1 + ζ/4
∗ · (1 + η−γ)

πR3

Then, σac(A) = I for I as in (2.10). Moreover, (1.2) has no non-trivial bounded
solutions ~δr for −ω2 ∈ I ◦T(−∞, 0] if Γ satisﬁes
(as I → ∞) for any positive constant c.
Some such EOS may be of the form P = τ ρ(r) + l(r) for some constant τ and
function l(r) tending suﬃciently rapidly to 0 as r → R−
∗ .
Proof. The hypothesis (3.1) assures that

and that (2.9) holds in the desired mode. The result then follows from Proposition
2.3 and Theorem 2.4, with choice of ζ determined by c, since the asymptotic
estimates of the LHS of (3.1) lead to 4 + ζ = c · K for
K def= (1 + η−γ)/(η−1 − 1).
(3.2)

(cid:3)

For later reference we make the following

Remark 3.3. For the choice of ~D in Proposition 3.1 the elements G1(I), G2(I)
equal their respective limits as in (2.13) up to order O(ηI ) (as I → ∞) so that
def= A − κΛ∗J0 + ζΛ∗ satisﬁes, more precisely, [A0]j,k = O(ηj ) as j → ∞ for
A0
|j − k| ≤ 1.

It turns out that we may indeed choose ~D so that condition (2.2) is satisﬁed,

for suitable ~M and ~r, as we demonstrate in

Theorem 3.2. Let ~M , ~r determine a mass distribution as in (2.7) for γ > 1.
Then, there is an admissible pressure-density distribution ~D by which the results
of Proposition 3.1 hold for some interval I.
Proof. We ﬁnd

r(I + 1) − r(I)

M (I + 1)

=

R∗ηI (1 − η)

M∗ · (1 − ηγ)ηγ(I+1) .

Since r2(I)

Oℓ1→ R2

∗ we have from (0.1) and L’Hˆopital’s Rule that ρ(I) =

O(η(γ−1)I ) (as I → ∞). We may choose Γ so that for given ζ > −4

(cid:3)
Example (3.4) satisﬁes Γ(I) = O(ηI ) (as I → ∞) and thus vanishes to order
O(R∗− r) as r → R−
∗ . Physical models associated with such non-polytropic cases
may well incorporate certain gas and chemical (indeed isentropic) properties:
Some related discussion can be found in Appendix B.3 of [22], Section 8.9 of [9]
and Section 58 of [17].

We will construct an admissible pressure-density distribution that results in an
inﬁnite number of eigenvalues. Our construction follows one by [10] whereby pp
spectra result in a special case satisfying G1(I) ≡ 1 and G2(I)
We outline the results of their construction below as

Oℓ2→ 0 (as I → ∞).

Proposition 3.3. (Previously Known.) One can construct the diagonal elements
G2(I) of A along with a sequence of vectors ~Xm such that the following hold for
G

def= A − J0,:

i) G2(I) = I −α for I ∈ Sm Bm for some 1/2 < α < 1, ﬁxed, where the sets

Bm are bounded, disjoint, discrete intervals with distance greater than 2
between each other with min Bm > Kmp+1 for some positive constant K
uniformly in m;

ii) the ~Xm’s satisfy || ~Xm||ℓ∞ = 1 with supp ~Xm ( Bm whose components

iv) D ~Xm, G ~XmE & mp−α(p+1);
v) D ~Xm, ~XmE ≍ mp;
vi) and, σess(A) = [−2, 2].
Several remarks are in order: Here f (x) . g(x) means f (x) = O(g(x)) as
(x → ∞) and f (x) ≍ g(x) means that f (x) . g(x) and g(x) . f (x) both hold;
thus, the implied bounds above are uniform in m. There results, by variational
arguments (Theorem 9.2 [10]), an inﬁnite sequence of eigenvalues {Ek}, such that
|Ek|
→ 2, but the convergence is not in Oℓ1 . Indeed, given any q < 3/2, α and
p may be chosen so that the sequence {Ek} diverges in Oℓq mode. Such may also
be constructed so that {Ek} clusters about both ±2, but negative eigenvalues Ek
better serve for our eigenfrequencies ω = √−Ek.
We ﬁnd that similar results arise in our problem (1.2). We start with an
admissible pressure-density distribution ~D as above but with

ℓ3/2

O

(3.5)

Γ(I) = (c − b · G(I))ηI

for G as in Proposition 3.3 and for constants 1/2 < α < 1 and c, b > 0 : Recalling
the various parameters as in (2.8) and (3.2), we state

Theorem 3.4. There is an admissible pressure-density distribution resulting in
an operator A as in (2.1) for which σpp(A) contains an inﬁnite sequence Ek :
k = 1, 2, . . . tending to −(ζ + 2κ)Λ∗, an endpoint of σess(A) = I, from values
less. Moreover, for each k there is an eigenvector associated to Ek for which the
corresponding perturbation ~δr is of class ℓ∞(Z+).

sidering Remark 3.3 we ﬁnd that the elements along the main diagonal of ˜A
are of order O(ηI ) and those along super- and sub-main diagonals are appraised
via [ ˜A]I,I+1 . I −α + ηI . With α > 1/2 we conclude from the Weyl Invariance

holds uniformly for all suﬃciently large m. It follows as in Proposition 3.3 that

for some positive constant C.

We have only to follow a part of the cited theorem [10], mutatis-mutandis:

There are positive constants M and CM such that

−D ~Xm, (A + 2) ~XmE > CM|| ~Xm||2m−α(p+1)

∀m ≥ M. Variational arguments now apply to show that supported in each
Bm : m ≥ M is a corresponding eigenvector with eigenvalue Em < −2 such that
|Em + 2| ≥ CM
If we keep b as above and vary c, we may apply the above construction but
with A replaced by A + ζΛ∗ for an appropriate constant ζ (see Proposition 3.1).
Considering Remark 3.3, ˜A likewise yields elements of order O(ηI ) along the

2 m−α(p+1), concluding the present case.

super- and sub-main diagonal elements. The result follows but with a shift of
the spectral values by −ζΛ∗ where ζ is determined by c. The more general case
now follows by scaling arguments.
(cid:3)

We note the following about the results above: Such a construct shows that
a small variation of Γ can change the discrete spectrum σdisc(A). Moreover, as
a sequence of eigenvalues converges to particular value near the stellar surface,
this value does not necessarily correspond to a value in σdisc. We see that G(I)
in (3.5) vanishes as r → R−
∗ to order O([ln(R∗ − r)]−α) and, hence, the entire
expression for Γ still vanishes to order O(R∗ − r) as in example (3.4). Yet, the
additional term −bG has an demonstrable eﬀect on the spectrum of A, even for
small b > 0, yielding oscillation states localized near r = R∗.

4. Polytropic Cases: Modified Difference Equation

We now apply our methods to some polytropic states in the discrete setting.
In order to apply the Jacobi spectral matrix methods we resort to another change
of variables. Here, we allow the oscillation frequency ω to vary with position,
while freezing time: We impose δrt = eitω(r)δr(r), supposing that the linear
perturbation δ and the operation d
d t commute (albeit in a formal sense; cf. [22]).
r δrt|t=0 = ∂j
Such modes satisfy [∂j
r δr(r) : j = 0, 1, 2, leaving (1.2) still valid.
Then, with

(4.1)

W def= diag(ω(1), ω(2), . . . , ω(I), . . .),

we obtain an inﬁnite matrix equation of the form

(4.2)

− W 2 ~X = A ~X

As we develop below, with an appropriate choice of W, depending on η and λ,
(4.2) leads to the form (1.2) but with LHS = −ω2(I)δr(I). Regarding the spatial
dependence of ω, we will call the values ω(I) local frequencies.
We now motivate our formulation (4.2) by way of a certain modiﬁcation of the

Jacobi matrix: We will study tri-diagonal matrices A given by

G3(I) = µI η−I ; G2(I) = θ − βI η−I

(self-adjoint) where

(4.3)

Lemma 4.1. Let A be a square, tri-diagonal matrix of the form (4.4). Then,
there is a diagonal matrix

D(x, y) = diag(d1(x, y), d2(x, y), . . . , dn(x, y))

for which the following hold:

(4.5)

B(x, y) = D(y, x)A(x, y)D(x, y)

is a tri-diagonal matrix whose elements [B]i,j satisfy

Now, setting α(I) = ⌊I/2⌋, λI = −λ + βI η2α(I)−I (for parameter λ ≤ 0),
ω(I) = √λI η−α(I), and x = y = η−1 in (4.4), we use Lemma 4.5 now to convert
equation (4.2) into a Jacobi-matrix eigenvalue problem of the form

so that −W 2X = H −2(L2X). We then set A def= HAH def= T − D for H as in

Since ~Y = H −1 ~X, equation (4.2) leads to

H −1(λY − DY ) = H −1(T − D)Y,

yielding (4.7).

We are ready to state

14

Proposition 4.2. The absolutely continuous spectrum of the operator T as in
(4.7) is [−2µ/η, 2µ/η] for µ as in (4.3), the interior of which contains no pure-
point spectra.

Proof. This is a consequence of part iii) of Theorem 2.2 applied to (4.7).

(cid:3)

It is worthwhile to point out that the nearly periodic nature of the elements of
D leads to the presence of spectral gaps under an appropriate formulation. If we
replace ~ω by ~ω♯ where ω♯(I) = √−λ η−α(I) and replace W 2 by λH −2, equation
(4.7) can be recasted as λ~Y = A~Y : We thereby convert equation (1.2) into a
weighted eigenvalue problem, now with LHS= −λη−2α(I) δr(I). We further note
that A is a perturbation of a Jacobi matrix with periodic coeﬃcients and, in our
search for negative eigenvalues, make the following

Remark 4.10. The absolutely continuous spectrum of B def= −A = −T + B is

given by

β(1+η)±√16η2µ2+β2(1−η)2

σac(B) = [E−, E1][[E2, E+]

2η

(resp.), E1 = β, and E2 = β

where E± =
η . Moreover,
the pure-point spectra is restricted to the spectral gaps (ie. σpp(B) ⊂ R \ σac(B))
and σess(B) is purely absolutely continuous.
See Theorem 7.11 along with equations (7.71) of [25]; or, see Chapter 5 of [21].
Although the ω♯(I) of Remark 4.10 do not depend on the βI , the associated
spectral sets still depend on β. Moreover, we see that the essential spectrum still
depends on the choice of partition (determined by η) in either case. Thus, out of
convenience, we continue with the formulation (4.7).

Recall that for a polytropic state there are positive constants K, Γ so that
P = K · (ρ(r))Γ . With mass distributions given by (2.7) for γ > 1, we now
consider distributions ~D that are admissible, thereby approximating polytropes
near the boundary r = R∗: That is, for a polytopic state, we suppose

(cid:18) P
M(cid:19) (I) = GM∗/(4πR4

(4.11)

(4.12)

ρ(I) =

M (I)

4πr2(I)(r(I) − r(I − 1))

(1 + O(η(1+ǫ)I ))

(as I → ∞) for some constant ǫ > 0. Under these conditions such a ~D will be
called an almost polytrope. Using a version of the Mean Value Theorem, it is
not diﬃcult to show, for instance, that (4.11) and (4.12) both hold for our mass
distributions if ρ(r) ∝ (R∗ − r)γ−1 with γ = Γ
Noting (M/ρ)(I) = O(ηI ) as I → ∞, we introduce
(4.13)

For ease of exposition, we start with an almost polytrope ~D where γ ≥ 2.

Γ−1 > 1 (taking ǫ = γ − 1 > 0).

Then, since G1(I)

With β def= limI→∞ βI and µ def= limI→∞ µI , the estimates of µI , and βI result in
Theorem 4.3. For an almost polytrope ~D with 1 < Γ ≤ 2 (equivalently, γ ≥ 2)
let A and A be deﬁned by G3(I), µI , G2(I), and βI as in (4.13). Then, the result
of Proposition 4.2 holds for A. Furthermore, if λ ∈ σac(A)T(−∞, 0], then any
~δr associated with a non-trivial solution vector ~X of (4.2) satisﬁes ~δr /∈ ℓ∞(N+);
and, the local frequencies ω(I) satisfy limI→∞ ω(I) = +∞.
Proof. We apply the results of Proposition 4.2 and Theorem 2.4 with θ = 4Λ∗
and βj, µj for j = 1, 2, . . . as in (4.3). We note that the estimates (4.14) lead to
~Y /∈ ℓ2 for any such λ ∈ σac(A): Moreover, estimates (2.14) apply for a basis ~Y±,
of the solution space. We therefore have Y (Ik) ≍ 1 as k → ∞ for a subsequence
of indices Ik. Then, since ~X = H ~Y and γ > 1, we have that

(4.15)

δr(Ik) =

(as k → ∞) resulting in lim supI→∞ |δr(I)| = ∞.
Finally, the unboundedness of ω(I) follows since

ηα(Ik)Y (Ik)

pM (Ik) ≍ η(α(Ik)−γIk/2) & η−Ik(γ−1)/2,

(4.16)

λI = −λ + βη > 0

and, hence, ω(I) & η−I/2 (as I → ∞).

(cid:3)

Following the above construction, we treat an alternative type of polytropic
distribution where density vanishes at the surface but γ is nearly 1 (whereby ρ
is nearly constant slightly away from surface): We suppose only condition (4.12)
and not necessarily (4.11), thereby imposing mass conservation but not excluding
the almost polytrope. In this case we set

(4.17)

M 2(cid:19) (I) = C∗ · ηI((γ−1)(Γ−1)−2)(1 + O(ηI ))
(cid:18) P ρ

16

for constants C∗ > 0 and γ, Γ > 1 with 0 < (γ − 1)(Γ − 1) ≤ 1. We now denote
ν def= η2−(γ−1)(Γ−1) and set

(4.18)

H = diag(cid:16)ν⌊1/2⌋, ν⌊2/2⌋, ν⌊3/2⌋ . . . , ν⌊I/2⌋, . . .(cid:17)

so as to recast our eigenvalue problem into the form (4.2) with G2, G3 so that

to state
Theorem 4.4. Suppose the mass distribution is as in (2.7) with 1 < γ ≤ Γ
Γ−1
with a polytropic ~D satisfying (4.12) and (4.17) for some constant Γ > 1. Then
the conclusions of Theorem 4.3 likewise hold, but for
σac(A) = [−2˜µ/ν, 2˜µ/ν]

with ˜µ as in (4.20).

Proof. For our choices of γ, Γ we have 0 < ν < 1 so that we may apply the
decomposition −HAH = T − D as in (4.8) and (4.9), and likewise apply the
analysis of Proposition 4.2 and Theorem 2.4, but with θ = 0, η replaced by
ν, and obvious substitutions for parameters βj, β, µj, µ via (4.20) and (4.19). In
particular, we have ν ≤ η so that results concerning ~δr and ~ω from the redeﬁnition
(4.18) of H follow as in (4.15) and (4.16).

(cid:3)

We end this section by noting the following about our polytropic and non-
polytropic cases, as well as the almost polytrope: The essential spectra can admit
intervals of arbitrary length as we are allowed to choose arbitrarily small η (or ν)
in choosing our partitions via ~M and ~r. This suggests perhaps that unbounded
intervals of such spectra may be present in some such cases as values of our
discrete parameters m and r pass to a continuous interval. This expectation is
indeed borne out in the remaining sections of this article.

(5.4)
Here we take ′ to mean the full derivative with respect to the independent variable
as indicated.

canonical form

with the standing assumptions that q, p, w, 1/w, and pw/p are continuous on

We introduce notation and terminology here to accommodate more precise es-
timates needed in the following sections: It will be convenient to denote q0(x) def=
Q(X)(x), q1(x) def= q(x)
w(x) and q2(x) def= q0(x)− q1(x). From the invertibility of (5.6)
we may, with obvious notation, likewise decompose Q0(X) = Q1(X)+ Q2(X).
The phrase ”near R∗” (”near ∞”) regarding an estimate or bound will mean
such will hold on some interval of the form [x0, R∗) (resp. [x0,∞)).
Our strategy in the next sections will be as follows: We apply results of subor-
dinancy theory where general boundedness of (non-trivial) solutions yields non-
L2 behavior (counter-intuitively); in turn, the later property yields unbounded
oscillation ξ. Along these lines, we make frequent use of the results discussed
below.

6. A Polytropic Outer Shell

As in Section 4 we consider an EOS of the form P = K(ρ(x))b with ρ(x) =
(R∗ − x)a some ﬁxed a, b > 0. Likewise, we have that Γ = b > 1 is constant on an
def= R∗ − δ < R∗. After a change of
interval [Rδ, R∗) for some ﬁxed, positive Rδ
variables we ﬁnd that for a(b− 1) > 1 our eigenvalue problem amounts to certain
L1 perturbations of a simple operator whereby the existence of absolutely con-
tinuous spectra is clear by the Kato-Rosenblum Theorem [19] (see also Chapter
11, [18]). For the case a(b − 1) > 2 we will further elaborate on the behavior of
solutions.
We introduce the following notation: Let Tλ be the set of solutions to (5.5) on
[0,∞); let S be the deﬁned by S def= {λ > 0|Y ∈ Tλ ⇒ sup[0,∞) |Y (X)| < ∞} and,

19

let W (x) def= pw(x)/p(x). For the operator L def= − d2
the following suﬃces for our applications to follow:
Theorem 6.1. Suppose W /∈ L1([Rδ, R∗), dx) and that

dX 2 + Q(X) on L2((0,∞)),

q0(x) ∈ C([Rδ, R∗])\ L1([Rδ, R∗); W (x) dx).

Then, σ(L) = σac(L). Indeed, S ⊇ (0,∞) and, moreover, for any ﬁxed λ > 0,
Y ′ is bounded on [0,∞) for every Y ∈ Tλ.
Proof. The result is an immediate consequence of Theorem 1 [20] and Theorem
5.1 from our change of variables (5.6).
(cid:3)
More precisely, the spectral measure l(λ) associated with L is absolutely contin-
uous and is supported in [0,∞), and l is absolutely continuous in the sense that
l(U ) > 0 for any (Lebesgue) measurable U ⊂ S of positive Lebesgue measure.

For our polytropic case, P = Kρb with ρ = (R∗ − x)a, we state

Proposition 6.2. Given ﬁxed a, δ, K > 0, with 0 < Rδ < R∗, and b > 1, the
following hold for q0(x) = Q(X)(x) :
i) q0(x) is smooth on [Rδ, R∗);
ii) q0(x) ≍ (R∗ − x)ab−a−2 near R∗; and,
iii) q0(x) − ka,b ∈ L1([Rδ, R∗), dX(x)) if 1 < ab − a ≤ 2 for some constant

ka,b, depending on a and b.

Proof. Here p(x) = bK(R∗ − x)abx4 and w(x) = (R∗ − x)ax4 and a computation
shows that

q1(x) = K

where
(6.1) Q(u) = 32 − 32(2 + ab)u + (32 + 4a(−1 + 7b) + a2(−1 + 2b + 3b2))u2.
In the case ab − a = 2 we have that q0(x) − ka,b . (R∗ − x) near R∗ for ka,b =
q0(R∗); hence, (q0(x) − ka,b)W (x) is bounded on [Rδ, R∗). For 1 < ab − a < 2 we
set ka,b = 0 as we ﬁnd that q0(x)W (x) is absolutely integrable on [Rδ, R∗). (cid:3)
We notice that Q(u) = 0 has a root u = 1 when a = 4/(3b − 1), but we will not
use this fact considering other restrictions on a and b.

We now perform a change of variables

Theorem 6.3. For the EOS as in Proposition 6.2 with a and b as in (6.2) we
have the following:

i) The result of Theorem 6.1 holds;
ii) the regularity condition (5.2) holds; and,
iii) for each λ > 0 every corresponding non-trivial δr(x) is unbounded.

Proof. We integrate over (Rδ, R∗) the quantity

Q(X)(x)dX(x) = q0(x)W (x)dx

with q0(x)W (x) ≍ (R∗ − x)
Addressing ii), we write

For any solution in Tλ we have that Y and Y ′ are bounded and ﬁnd

near R∗ so that (5.2) holds.

Finally, by Theorem 5.1, Y (X) ≍ 1 near ∞ so that result iii) follows from
Proposition 5.2.
(cid:3)
We remark: The requirement that a(b − 1) > 1 excludes those states studied in
[3] which amount to 0 < a < 5 and b = (1 + a)/a, whereby a(b − 1) = 1.

7. A Non-polytropic Case

We now consider an example where Γ is not necessarily constant. We will

consider a case where we replace P (x) by P (ρ, x) where

(7.1)

P (ρ, x) = T (x)ρ + L(x)

for a non-increasing function T . The function T can be considered a function of
temperature as in some physical models, where temperature varies with position.
We compute q1(x) and q2(x) for ρ as in Proposition 6.2 and P as in (7.1) with

T (x) = K0 · (R∗ − x)ab−a and L(x) = L0 · (R∗ − x)c

for ﬁxed K0, L0 > 0, a ≥ 1, b ≥ 1, and c > 0. With w(x) = x4ρ(x) and p(x) =
T (x)ρ(x)x4 we have that q2(x) is the same as that of Proposition 6.2, but with
bK replaced by K0. We compute

q1(x) = −

abK0 · (R∗ − x)−1−a+ab + 4cL0 · (R∗ − x)−1−a+c
K0R2

x

∗(R∗ − x)−2−a+abQ(x/R∗)
where, of course, Q is the polynomial given by (6.1).

q2(x) = −

16x2

We comment: With the EOS (7.1) we admit some cases of unbounded Q(X)
such as the case c ≤ ab − 1 whereby q0(x) ≍ (R∗ − x)−1−a+c near x = R∗ and,
q0(x) = −∞ for c < a + 1. We can treat such unbounded q0
hence, limx→R−
by applying results from [24] (see also [26]) for which we will ﬁnd the following
estimates useful:

near R∗. As for physical motivation, we note that when b > 1 and c > a, we have
that P/ρ → 0 as x → R∗, corresponding to some related models as discussed in
Section 8.3 of [9]. Here pressure can be attributed to that of perfect gas, given
by T · ρ where temperature T vanishes at the surface, and another source, given
by L(x) - such as radiation, for instance. In the case c = a + 1 ≤ ab we can
also assign L0 or perhaps K0 so that HSE holds at x = R∗. Moreover, we note
that our general results do not depend on the domain length δ > 0 where, by
continuity arguments, (5.3) can be made arbitrarily small.

Theorem 7.1. For the EOS (7.1) with a, b ≥ 1 suppose that either

i) ab ≥ a + 2 and c > a + 1; or,
ii) ab ≥ a + 3 and c > a.

Then the absolutely continuous spectrum contains (0,∞) and, the diﬀerential
equation (5.5) has no solutions of L2(dX) class near X = ∞ for any such λ.

Proof. We note that in either case i) or ii) the result follows by Theorem 6.1
when c > ab − 1. Moreover, for the remainder of the proof we may suppose that
c ≤ ab since the argument for c > ab is the same as that for c = ab.
We start with case i). We ﬁrst consider the subcase c ≥ (ab + a)/2 where we
ﬁnd Q ∈ L1(dX) near ∞ so that we may apply Theorems 5 and 6 of [24]. In the
subcase a + 1 < c ≤ (ab + a)/2 we have limX→∞ Q(X) = limx→R−
q0(x) = 0 and
that Q(X) ≤ 0 is bounded so that we may again apply Theorems 5 and 6 of [24].
We now consider case ii), needing only to suppose c ≤ a + 1. From (7.2) we
ﬁnd that Q2(X), Q′(X) and Q′
2(X) are locally absolutely continuous. We also

(λ − Q1(X)(x))3/2 W (x) ≍ (R∗ − x)(−3+2(ab−a)−(c−a))/2
(λ − Q1(X)(x))5/2 W (x) ≍ (R∗ − x)(−3+(ab−a)−(c−a))/2

Remark 7.4. We note the results of Theorem 7.1 hold for other combinations of
a, b > 1 and c > a provided ab − a > 2 and the exponent of the RHS of estimate
(7.3) is no greater than −1.

We analyze our model, demonstrating unbounded δr while satisfying the reg-

ularity condition via

Theorem 7.2. The following hold for all non-trivial solutions in Tλ for the
equation as in Theorem 7.1:

i) The regularity condition is satisﬁed; and,
ii) the corresponding δr(r) is unbounded as r → R−
∗ .

Proof. To prove item i) we use (6.3) and apply estimates for Y and Y ′ according
to various cases in the proof of Theorem 7.1.

For c > a + 1 we may apply Theorem 5.1 to obtain

near ∞ and the result follows as in Theorem 6.2. For a < c ≤ a + 1 we have from
Lemma 12 [24] that

Y (X), Y ′(X) ≍ 1

Y (X) . (1 + |Q1(X)|)−1/4 ; Y ′(X) . (1 + |Q1(X)|)1/4

near ∞ so that from (5.6), the chain rule, and the product rule

(P Γy′) (x) . (R∗ − x)

Item ii) follows from Theorem 7.1 and Proposition 5.2.

(cid:3)

23

Remark 7.6. In the estimates 7.5 of the case c < a+1 we only suppose ab−a > 2
and, hence, the results of Theorem 7.2 likewise hold for cases as discussed in
Remark 7.4.
