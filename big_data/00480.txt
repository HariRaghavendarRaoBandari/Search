ABSTRACT

We present an elemental-abundance analysis of an extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H]
< −3.0) star, SDSS J134338.67+484426.6, identiﬁed during the course of the MARVELS
spectroscopic pre-survey of some 20000 stars to identify suitable candidates for exoplanet
searches. This star, with an apparent magnitude V = 12.14, is the lowest metallicity star found
in the pre-survey, and is one of only ∼20 known EMP stars that are this bright or brighter. Our
high-resolution spectroscopic analysis shows that this star is a subgiant with [Fe/H] = −3.42,
having ”normal” carbon and no enhancement of neutron-capture abundances. Strontium is
under-abundant, [Sr/Fe] = −0.47, but the derived lower limit on [Sr/Ba] indicates that Sr is
likely enhanced relative to Ba. This star belongs to the sparsely populated class of α-poor
EMP stars that exhibit low ratios of [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ca/Fe] compared to typical halo
stars at similar metallicity. The observed variations in radial velocity from several epochs of
(low- and high-resolution) spectroscopic follow-up indicate that SDSS J134338.67+484426.6
is a possible long-period binary. We also discuss the abundance trends in EMP stars for r-
process elements, and compare with other magnesium-poor stars.

Key words: Galaxy: halo - stars: metal poor - stars: abundances - stars: Population II.

1 INTRODUCTION

Extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H] < −3.0) stars were formed
during the very early phases of our Galaxy’s evolution, and thus
carry the chemical
imprints of the ﬁrst generations of super-
novae that exploded in the Galaxy (Bromm, Yoshida & Hernquist
2003; Kobayashi et al. 2006). Detailed abundance analysis of such
stars constrain the nuclear processes and nucleosynthesis sites
which were prevalent during early galaxy evolution, and can be
used to explore predictions of Galactic chemical-evolution models
(Hansen, Montes & Arcones 2014).

EMP stars exhibit a variety of distinct abundance patterns
(for detailed reviews see Beers & Christlieb 2005; Frebel & Norris
2015). High-resolution spectroscopic surveys using 8-10 m class
telescopes have revealed a number of interesting trends in the abun-
dance ratios of these stars (Cayrel et al. 2004; Barklem et al. 2005;
Lai et al. 2008; Yong et al. 2013; Roederer et al. 2014). For exam-
ple, Franc¸ois et al. (2007) showed that there exists a large scatter

in the [n-capture/Fe] ratios for stars with [Fe/H] < −2.5, while
the α-elements and iron-peak elements exhibit a surprisingly uni-
form behaviour. These authors also showed that the light n-capture
element abundances (e.g., Sr) are anti-correlated with the abun-
dances of heavier species such as Ba, suggesting the operation of
the so-called Light Element Primary Process (LEPP) among some
stars of extremely low metallicity (Montes et al. 2007). As these
trends were derived from samples of stars that did not exhibit other
anomalies in their abundance ratios, they may be representative of
the well-mixed ISM abundance at these metallicities. Similar re-
sults have been observed in other well-mixed environments, such
as globular-cluster stars (Otsuki et al. 2006).

The majority of EMP stars in the halo and nearby dwarf galax-
ies exhibit low scatter in their α-elements, although a few ex-
hibit abnormally low values compared to the the mean halo α-
element abundance (Carney et al. 1997; King 1997; Lai et al. 2009;
Aoki et al. 2009; Tafelmeyer et al. 2010; Kirby & Cohen 2012;
Cohen et al. 2013). Recently, Caffau et al. (2013) identiﬁed a class

of α-poor EMP stars, several of which exhibit low carbon abun-
dances as well (see also Cohen et al. 2013, and references therein).
Kobayashi et al. (2014) showed that α-poor EMP stars can be
naturally explained by the nucleosynthesis yields of core-collapse
supernovae, i.e., 13 - 25 M⊙ supernovae or hypernovae, but pointed
out that detailed abundances of additional iron-peak elements,
which are not available for most of this subset of EMP stars, are
required to better constrain the models.

According to Ivans et al. (2003), the low α-element abun-
dances exhibited by stars in their sample are due to the the larger
contribution of SNIa yields over the pre-existing SNeII ejecta.
However, EMP stars might have formed much earlier than the on-
set of SNIa. So it is less likely that the EMP stars are affected by
the SNe Ia yields unless they belong to a system where the star for-
mation rate is very low (and mixing is highly inhomogenous), so as
to keep the gas cloud low in metallicity until further star formation
has taken place (after the onset of SNe Ia).

In this paper we report low- and high-resolution spectro-
scopic follow-up observations of a newly identiﬁed EMP star,
SDSS J134338.67+484426.6 (hereafter, SDSS J1343+4844) that
may shed additional light on the nature of early nucleosynthesis
in the Galaxy, in particular for stars that do not exhibit other abun-
dance anomalies (such as carbon over-abundances) that are com-
monly found for EMP stars. Since SDSS J1343+4844 is bright
compared to many of the known EMP stars, particularly among
the rare α-poor sub-class, it also presents an ideal target for future
high-resolution studies capable of deriving detailed isotopic ratios,
which can be used to better constrain the SNe models.

2 OBSERVATION AND DATA REDUCTION

SDSS J1343+4844 was identiﬁed as a likely metal-poor star from
SDSS-III-MARVELS (Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exo-
planet Large-area Survey; Ge et al. 2008) pre-survey spectroscopy
using the SDSS legacy spectrographs (Gunn et al. 2006). The pre-
survey was used for selecting suitable bright dwarfs for planet
searches, in the magnitude range 9 < V < 13 and with spectral
types from late F to K. MARVELS pre-survey plates were reduced
using a slightly modiﬁed version (NOCVS:v5 3 23) of the IDL-
SPEC2D pipeline. Stellar atmospheric parameters were estimated
using the n-SSPP pipeline, a modiﬁed version of the SEGUE Stel-
lar Parameter Pipeline (SSPP; Lee et al. 2008, see also Beers et al.
2014 for a description of the use of the n-SSPP). Based on the
pipeline procedures and visual inspection, SDSS J1343+4844 was
identiﬁed as a carbon-normal EMP star.

Figure 1 shows the metallicity distribution of the complete
set of MARVELS pre-survey stars; these stars clearly exhibit peak
metallicities arising from the thin-disk and thick-disk components
of the Galaxy. As is clear from inspection of this ﬁgure, metal-poor
stars are quite rare in the sample, due to the low Galactic latitude
of the pre-survey area. Among the MARVELS pre-survey spectro-
scopic spectra (N ∼ 20000), SDSS J1343+4844 was the only star
found with metallicity [Fe/H] < −3.0.

Follow up high-resolution (R ∼ 30000) spectroscopic obser-
vations of SDSS J1343+4844 were obtained with the ARC Echelle
Spectrograph on the 3.5-m telescope at Apache Point Observatory
(APO) and the High resolution Spectrograph (HRS) on the Hobby-
Eberly 9.2-m telescope (HET). We also obtained multi-epoch low-
resoluion (R ∼ 1300) spectra using the Hanle Faint Object Spec-
trograph Camera (HFOSC) at the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Tele-
scope (HCT). The spectral resolution, wavelength coverage, and

The APO pipeline-reduced high-resolution spectrum exhib-
ited slightly lower equivalent widths compared to the HET data.
Thus, we manually re-reduced the data using IRAF, in order to
ensure proper background subtraction, and found a better match
between the equivalent widths of the APO and HET datasets in
the overlapping wavelength regions (see Figure 2). The equivalent
widths for individual species are listed in the table in the appendix.

3 RADIAL VELOCITIES

Radial velocities were calculated based on six epochs of high-
and low-resolution data taken over a span of ﬁve years. A cross-
correlation analysis was performed, using the best-matching syn-
thetic template that represents the stellar parameters and the chem-
ical abundances of SDSS J1343+4844, as derived below, and de-

graded to match the spectral resolution of each observation. These
observed velocities were then corrected for Earth’s motion; the re-
sultant heliocentric radial velocities are presented in Table 1.

A stability analysis of the HCT-HFOSC spectrograph was per-
formed in order to estimate realistic errors for the derived radial
velocities of this star. For this purpose, calibration exposures of
FeAr, taken during the course of an entire night, were used. One
of the lamp exposures was taken as a reference and relative radial
velocities were derived. Although drifts in the calibration spectra
for which the telescope position did not change are less than 2
km/sec, a large systematic shift of the spectra was noticed for a
number of different telescope pointings; ranging from −30 km/s
to +30 km/s. The systemic shift in the spectra due to the chang-
ing telescope position has been corrected using the prominent [OI]
skylines at 5577.34, 6300.3, 6363.8 ˚A . We took the median of the
shifts calculated from these lines and corrected all the spectra ob-
served with HCT accordingly.

We made use of the software package RVLIN, provided by
Wright & Howard (2009), which is a set of IDL routines to ﬁt Ke-
plerian orbits to the radial velocity data, and ﬁnd the period of the
radial-velocity variation. The radial-velocity measurements exhibit
a variation with a period of 592 days; the best ﬁt for is shown in Fig-
ure 3. Although the data are insufﬁcient to derive the mass ratio of
the binary system, the binary nature appears to be clear. Additional
radial-velocity monitoring of this system would be useful to check

on the derived period, given the sparse coverage of the proposed
orbit at present.

4 STELLAR PARAMETERS

Low- and high-resolution spectroscopic data were both used for de-
riving estimates of the effective temperature, log g, and metallicity,
[Fe/H], for SDSS J1343+4844, as described below, so that these
determinations might be compared with one another.

Stellar temperature estimates were derived making use, in
part, of various available photometric datasets. The photomet-
ric colours and errors are listed in Table 3. A reddening es-
timation (E(B-V) = 0.009) from the Schlegel et al. dust maps
(Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis 1998) was used. Optical (APASS;
Henden et al. 2015) and NIR (2MASS; Cutri et al. 2003) photomet-
ric data were used to derive effective temperature estimates, based
on the Alonso relations (Alonso, Arribas & Martinez-Roger 1996;
Alonso, Arribas & Mart´ınez-Roger 1999) assuming a dwarf classi-
ﬁcation for a metallicity [Fe/H] = −3.0 (Table 2).

We also used VOSA (http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/), the online
SED ﬁtter to derive the temperature, using all of the available
photometry (optical, 2MASS, and WISE, Wright et al. 2010). A
Bayesian ﬁt using the ATLAS-NOVER-NEWODF model yielded
a best-ﬁt value of Tef f = 5750 K.

We also ﬁt the Hβ line wings of the APO and HET spectra for
various temperatures. The red wing of Hβ in the APO spectrum lies
close to the edge of an echelle order, so it was not considered in the
ﬁtting. The best-ﬁt synthetic spectrum in this region, along with the
observed spectra from APO and HET, are shown in Figure 4.

The derived temperature from the n-SSPP pipeline is 6161 K,
which clearly deviates from the rest of the estimates. This is due,
in part, to the fact that the ﬂux calibration of the MARVELS pre-
selection spectrum is not accurate, as these plug-plates were ob-
served during twilight at high airmass. So, we re-derived Tef f us-
ing only the normalized SDSS spectrum, obtaining Tef f = 5832 K.
An effective temperature of 5620 K was derived using the high-
resolution spectra, employing the excitation equilibrium for the de-
rived abundances using Fe I lines.

Finally, Tef f is also derived from the V-K colour, where the
Ks magnitude is used instead of the K magnitude (the difference
between the two magnitudes is Ks− K = −0.0003, which yields no
difference in the derived temperature); we obtained Tef f = 5671 K.
This estimate differs from the temperature obtained based on the
excitation equillibrium approach by only 50 K, which we adopt for
our subsequent analysis.

We employ several different methods for the estimation of sur-
face gravity of SDSS J1343+4844, including the ionization equi-

The adopted stellar atmospheric parameters are listed in Table 4.

4.1 Abundance analysis

We have used the ATLAS9 NEWODF (Castelli & Kurucz 2004)
model atmospheres without convective overshooting. The main
abundance analysis results come from the APO spectrum, since
it covers a broader wavelength region. In the overlapping regions
of both the APO and HET spectra, a ﬁnal abundance value is de-
rived using a weighted average of abundances from both spectra.
For the Hβ and Mg ﬁtting, the HET spectrum is primarily used be-
cause these lines fall at the edge of the echelle orders, and in such
cases continuum normalization was better accomplished from the
HET spectrum. We considered only lines with equivalent widths
less than 100 m ˚A for the abundance analysis, since they are on the
linear part of the curve of growth, and are relatively insensitive to
the choice of microturbulence.

We have adopted the solar abundance from Grevesse & Sauval
(1998); solar isotopic fractions were used for all the elements. We
used the CH linelist compiled by Masseron (private communica-
tion) and CN molecular line list compiled by Plez et al. (2005),
and the NH and C2 molecular-line lists from the Kurucz database.
The atomic data for the other lines have been listed in the appendix
along with the respective references used. The line lists used are the
same as in Cui, Sivarani & Christlieb (2013). We employed version
12 of the turbospectrum code for spectrum synthesis and abundance
analysis (Alvarez & Plez 1998; Plez 2012).

Figure 4. The Hβ region from the APO spectrum (black), the HET spec-
trum (violet), and the synthesized spectrum (red) are shown. The best ﬁt
corresponds to Tef f = 5620 K. The red wing of the APO spectrum falls at
the edge of the echelle orders, so only the blue wing is considered for the
ﬁt.

librium of Fe I and Fe II lines, isochrone ﬁtting, and the best-ﬁt of
the Mg I wings. We detected only four Fe II lines in the spectra,
and derived log g = 3.44. Theoretical isochrones (Demarque et al.
2004) for an age range of 11-13 Gyr have been ﬁtted by assum-
ing a temperature of 5620 K, [Fe/H] = −3.5 and [α/Fe] = 0. The
log g values are taken where the temperature lines intersects the
isochrones. There are two possibilities – the star could be a dwarf
(log g ∼ 4.7) or a subgiant (log g ∼ 3.4). We also ﬁt the Mg I
lines for both the APO and HET spectra at λ5167 ˚A, λ5172 ˚A, and
λ5183 ˚A for various values of log g, and obtained a value of log g
= 3.4 (Figure 5). We adopt a value of log g = 3.4, a value that is
consistent with all three methods.

The microturbulent velocity (ξ) of the star is derived using 60
Fe I lines, by adjusting the input microturbulence value in such a

5 ABUNDANCES

5.1 Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen

There is only a weak CH G-band present in our spectra. The carbon
abundance was derived by iteratively ﬁtting the bandhead region
with synthetic spectra, and adopting the value that yields the best
matched the observed spectra. The APO spectrum is very noisy
in the G-band region, and the HET spectrum did not cover this
wavelength. So, we have used the low-resolution SDSS and HCT
spectra to derive the carbon abundance from the CH G-band re-
gion. The ﬁt is not particularly good due to the weakness of the
band and contamination due to the Hγ wing, so our reported value
should be considered provisional. However, it is also obvious that
SDSS J1343+4844 is not enhanced in carbon, which would have
resulted in a much larger CH G-band for the S/N of the observed
spectra. The signal to noise ratio at 338 nm wavelength region is
very poor to conﬁrm an enhancement in nitrogen abundance. Oxy-
gen lines at 777 nm is too weak to be detected. Hence we could not
derive meaningful abundances.

5.2 The α-elements
Magnesium lines at 3838 ˚A and 5172 ˚A are detected in the spec-
tra. Only two lines of the triplet at 5172 ˚A and one clean line in
the 3838 ˚A region were used to determine the abundance. The de-
rived [Mg/Fe] ratio is ([Mg/Fe] = +0.15); it is not enhanced as often
found for halo stars. The silicon line at 3905 ˚A is used for the abun-
dance estimate; the result is also close to solar, [Si/Fe] = −0.02.
The titanium abundance is found to be [Ti/Fe] = +0.38. We could
not detect the S I lines at 9212 ˚A and 9237 ˚A, thus only derived an

upper limit for sulphur. The Ca abundance was derived from the
three prominent Ca I lines at 4226.73 ˚A, 4302.53 ˚A and 4434.96
˚A; they indicate a slightly enhanced [Ca/Fe] ratio (+0.19).

Overall, the α-element enhancement for SDSS J1343+4844
([α/Fe] ∼+0.1, taking only the Mg and Si abundances into ac-
count) is lower than for typical halo stars in the Galaxy ([α/Fe]
∼ +0.4). Non-LTE effects on the Mg and Ca abundances for EMP
stars were investigated by Mashonkina, Korn & Przybilla (2007),
Andrievsky et al. (2010), and Spite et al. (2012). The non-LTE
corrections for Mg are +0.1 to +0.3 dex. Hence, the Mg abun-
dance ratios could be systematically higher than those derived
by our LTE analysis. However, most of the Mg abundances re-
sults that are available for EMP stars are also based on an LTE
analysis, and exhibit higher [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios relative to
SDSS J1343+4844. The Ca I 4226 ˚A line is affected by NLTE ef-
fects, compared to other subordinate lines. These lines are very
weak in our spectra, however they show consistent values with the
abundances derived from Ca I 4226 ˚A.

5.3 The odd-Z elements

The sodium abundance is derived from the Na D1 and D2 res-
onance lines at 5890 ˚A and 5896 ˚A, and the abundance of alu-
minium is derived using the resonance doublet at 3944 ˚A and
3961.5 ˚A. These resonance lines are very sensitive to NLTE ef-
fects. The NLTE corrections to the abundance are −0.30 dex for
Na (Baumueller, Butler & Gehren 1998) and +0.65 dex for Al
(Baumueller & Gehren 1997).

After the NLTE corrections are applied, our derived abun-
dances for this star are in good agreement with the values found
for other EMP stars (Cayrel et al. 2004; Lai et al. 2008).

5.4 The iron-peak elements

Iron abundances are derived from 68 Fe I and 4 Fe II lines. The
abundance derived from the Fe I and Fe II lines show a difference
of ∼ 0.3 dex, which may arise from the small number of weak Fe II
lines. The difference between Fe I and Fe II is in agreement with
the NLTE effects explored by Asplund (2005). We detected Mn,
Cr, and Ni among the iron-peak elements. The abundance of Mn
was derived from the resonance Mn triplet at 4030 ˚A. The spectral
line at 4034.4 ˚A was not used in the abundance analysis, since it is
affected by a bad pixel. The abundance of scandium is based on one
line at 4246.8 ˚A, and is found to be similar to other EMP stars. The
observed abundances of Cr and Mn are also similar to other EMP
stars. The [Cr/Mn] ratio at the metallicity of SDSS J1343+4844
is in agreement with the [Cr/Mn] ratio obtained for EMP stars by
Cayrel et al. (2004). The abundance ratio derived for Ni, using two
lines (3783.5 ˚A and 3858.29 ˚A) is [Ni/Fe] = +0.32.

Figure 6 shows a comparison of our derived abundances for
SDSS J1343+4844 compared to the mean abundances of EMP gi-
ants and dwarfs. The iron-peak elements agree with the mean EMP
abundances of these elements.

5.5 The neutron-capture elements

The neutron-capture elements in SDSS J1343+4844 are under-
abundant relative to the solar values.

Resonance lines of strontium Sr II 4077 ˚A and 4215 ˚A
are detected; both the lines exhibit under-abundances with re-
spect to the solar ratio ([Sr/Fe] = −0.47). We did not detect

barium, thus we estimated an upper limit for the abundance of
Ba in SDSS J1343+4844 by ﬁtting the Ba II resonance lines
at 4554 ˚A and 4934 ˚A, incorporating the hyperﬁne splitting by
McWilliam et al. (1995) and assuming a solar isotopic composi-
tion. The upper limit derived for Ba is [Ba/Fe] < −0.54, also quite
low.

compared with samples available from Ivans et al. (2003) (green ﬁlled

sites of their production. However, it is also interesting to study
objects that do not exhibit such enhancements, since they may rep-
resent the mean ISM abundances at those epochs. This will help
to understand the frequency of the nuclear sites that produce the
peculiar abundance enhancements. SDSS J1343+4844 does not ex-
hibit enhancement of C and possibly N and O abundances, indicat-
ing that there was no internal CN processing, which is consistent
with its evolutionary stage as a subgiant. Spite et al. (2006) and
Bonifacio et al. (2009) show that the mean [C/Fe] abundance ra-
tios in unmixed giants and dwarfs are about [C/Fe] = +0.19 and
[C/Fe] = +0.45, respectively. The SAGA compilation (Suda et al.
2008) and Figure 2 of Bonifacio et al. (2009) also show that the car-
bon abundance ratios in the carbon-normal EMP stars are slightly
enhanced with respect to the solar ratio. SDSS J1343+4844 has
[C/Fe] = +0.42, based on the low-resolution spectrum, consistent
with these EMP stars.

6.2 Stars with low α-element abundances at [Fe/H] < −3.0

In spite of having similar elemental abundances compared with the
mean abundances of EMP stars, SDSS J1343+4844 belongs to the
rare class of carbon-normal EMP stars that exhibit low α-element
abundances. It is thus interesting explore the origin of such stars.

Figure 8 shows the abundances of elements from the
Vargas et al. (2013) sample. The α-poor stars from Ivans et al.
(2003) and Caffau et al. (2013) are also shown. SDSS J1343+4844
falls in the region close to the mean α abundances of dwarf galax-
ies. However the halo α-element abudances for stars with [Fe/H]
< −3.0 exhibit a large scatter.

Low α-element abundances are expected for a low star-
formation rate, similar to that found for many dwarf spheroidal
galaxies. If this star belongs to a population that is representative
of a low star-formation rate, inhomogeniously-mixed system, then
SDSS J1343+4844 could be younger than other EMP stars, which
are α-element enhanced at the same metallicity.

6.3 Neutron-capture elements for stars with [Fe/H] < −3.0

SDSS J1343+4844 exhibits similar abundance patterns as those of
EMP dwarfs and giants for the Fe-peak elements and n-capture el-
ements as well. Strontium abundance ratios for EMP dwarfs and
giants are between [Sr/Fe] = −0.6 and [Sr/Fe] = −0.1 at metal-
licities of [Fe/H] = −3.0 (Andrievsky et al. 2011), which is again
similar to SDSS J1343+4844. The upper limit for the Ba abundance
of our star ([Ba/Fe] < −0.54) lies well within the average Ba abun-
dances of EMP stars having normal carbon abundance at the same
metallicity (Cohen et al. 2013; [Ba/Fe] ∼ −0.6).

During the early epochs of chemical evolution, asymptotic
giant-branch stars would not have had time to contribute to the
ISM (Kobayashi et al. 2014). They contribute signiﬁcantly only af-
ter z = 1.8 (roughly [Fe/H] > −2.4). Hence, the n-capture elements
seen in SDSS J1343+4844 have likely had contributions from mas-
sive stars. Recent observations of large opacity due to heavy el-
ements in kilonovae Tanvir et al. (2013) has brought renewed in-
terest in NS-NS mergers as a promising candidate for r-process-
element production. NS-NS mergers were proposed long ago
(Lattimer & Schramm 1976; Lattimer et al. 1977; Meyer 1989),
and also in recent studies (Freiburghaus, Rosswog & Thielemann
1999; Goriely, Bauswein & Janka 2011; Rosswog et al. 2014;
Wanajo et al. 2014; Vangioni et al. 2016), as promising sites for
production of the r-process elements. Observationally-motivated
work on this subject includes Honda et al. (2004), Franc¸ois et al.
(2007), and Sneden, Cowan & Gallino (2008). These spectroscopic
studies ﬁnd a large scatter in [Eu/Fe] ratios (at least two orders of
magnitude) for stars with [Fe/H] ≤ -2.5. They also show that the
lighter and heavier r-process elements correlate very well, indi-
cating possible connection, however their ratios at different metal-
licites suggest two possible evolutionary behaviours below [Fe/H]
< −2.5. An additional mechanism, such as the LEPP (light ele-
ment primary process), might be operating at metallicities [Fe/H]
< −3.0 (Montes et al. 2007; Francois et al. 2007)

Most chemical evolution models are unable to explain all the
observations. Recent work by Tsujimoto & Shigeyama (2014) and
Ishimaru, Wanajo & Prantzos (2015) address these issues by as-
suming a chemical evolution of sub-halos with different masses
and star-formation rates (SFR) contributing to the Galactic halo
rather than chemical evolution within a single halo. Prantzos (2006)
showed that if the sub-halos evolved at different rates, there would
be no unique relation between age and metallicity; in that case there
is possibility of an ”early” appearance of r-process elements and
their large dispersion can be explained, even if the main source of
those elements is NSMs.

Figure 9 is motivated by Figure 2 in Tsujimoto & Shigeyama
(2014). Tsujimoto & Shigeyama (2014) successfully explained the
large scatter in [Eu/Fe] at low metallicities and the observed corre-
lation between [light r-process/Eu] and [Eu/Fe]. According to these
authors, CCSNe produce lighter r-process elements and the heav-
ier r-process is produced by NS-NS mergers. The nucleosynthesis
products of these two sources are mixed to different amounts within
the sub-halos due to the differences in their wind speeds and a vari-
ations of sub-halo masses. A schematic diagram, shown in Figure
10, illustrates this. The high ratios of [light r-process/heavier r-
process] is argued to be produced by massive sub-halos and a lower
ratio is produced in low mass sub-halos.

Here we use barium to represent heavier r-process elements,
and strontium to represent lighter r-process elements. The data
shown in Figure 9 do not include carbon-enhanced stars, hence s-
process contribution is not expected for stars with [Fe/H] < −2.0.

Figure 9. The evolution of lighter versus heavier r-process elemets are
shown. The blue and red lines mark the contributions from massive and
low-mass sub-halos that were accreted into the Galaxy, similar to Tsujimoto
& Shigeyama (2015). The high ratios of [Sr/Ba] are due to massive sub-
halos, while low [Sr/Ba] values are from low-mass sub-halos. These are
non-CEMP stars, hence s-process contribution from stars with [Fe/H] ≤
−2.0 is not expected. The data is from the SAGA database (Suda et al.
2008). SDSS J1343+4844 is marked as a green ’X’.

Figure 10. A schematic representation of the mechanism proposed by
Tsujimoto & Shigeyama (2014). The wind from NS-MS mergers is shown
in red and the wind from CCSNe are shown in blue. The wind from NS-
NS mergers span the entire sub-halo, whereas the wind from CCSNe blast
waves does not cover the entire massive sub-halo (109M⊙), but pollutes a
larger ﬁlling factor for a low-mass halo (106-107M⊙), producing different
dilution and hence different ratios of [Sr/Ba].

The two regimes shown by Tsujimoto & Shigeyama (2014) are
clearly seen in this ﬁgure as well. The region enclosed by the blue
curve is expected to be occupied by stars that are formed within
massive sub-halos (109M⊙) and the region enclosed by the red
curve corresponds to stars that are formed within low-mass sub-
halos (106-107M⊙). SDSS J1343+4844 clearly falls in the middle
of these distribution, indicating that the star is formed from a mixed
ISM without peculiar composition. Figure 9 also shows the loca-
tion of α-poor stars with [α/Fe] < 0.1 (red dots). We ﬁnd that they
do not occupy any preferred location; rather, they are uniformly
spread, in-spite of the two regions shown in the plot representing

different mass ranges of the sub-halos. This result indicates that
the SFRs for sub-halos of different masses may be similar during
these epochs. Normally, α-poor stars are expected to have formed
in low-mass sub-halos with low SFRs. A different SFR for different
sub-halo masses will also affect the [Sr/Ba] ratio, which does not
match well with the observations. Apart from the sub-halo masses
and SFR, the timescale of these sub-halos merging into the Galaxy
is also essential for understanding the ﬁnal abundance ratios.

6.4 Lithium depletion and binarity
The lithium line at 6707 ˚A is not detected in SDSS J1343+4844.
The derived upper limit agrees with the declining lithium abun-
dance trend for stars with [Fe/H] < −3.0 (Sbordone et al. 2010).
There are two possibilities for the depletion of lithium: binary mass
transfer and binary-induced mixing, or mixing due to the evolution-
ary status of the object as a subgiant. Detection of a radial-velocity
variation with no peculiar chemical composition support the idea
of binary-induced mixing. Most short-period binaries are found to
have preserved their lithium, possibly due to tidal locking. How-
ever long-period binaries with periods of few hundred days seem
to have depleted lithium abundances (Ryan & Deliyannis 1995),
which could be the case for SDSS J1343+4844.

6.5 Conclusions

We have derived LTE abundances for SDSS J1343+4844, a bright
EMP star identiﬁed during the MARVELS pre-survey. The abun-
dance pattern for most elements in this star are similar to other
carbon-normal EMP stars, except for the low α-element abundance
and the apparent depletion of lithium. The depletion of lithium
could be understood in terms of binary-induced mixing or addi-
tional convection, as the object is a subgiant. Low α-element abun-
dance, along with the agreement of the observed ratios of the car-
bon abundances and heavy elements with the mean EMP value is
not so easy to understand. We also show that the α-poor halo stars
exhibit a wide range of lighter and heavier r-process ratios. An ISM
with contributions from Pop III intermediate-mass stars, along with
later Pop II contributions with a low SFR, may explain the abun-
dance patterns seen in SDSS J1343+4844˙SDSS J1343+4844.

Predictions of several key elemental abundance ratios, espe-
cially C,N, α and light/heavy r-process elements from a chemical
evolution model incorporating hierarchical merging of sub-halos
of different masses and SFR may help to understand these observa-
tions.
