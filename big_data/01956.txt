BALL CONVEX BODIES IN MINKOWSKI SPACES

THOMAS JAHN, HORST MARTINI, AND CHRISTIAN RICHTER

To our teachers, colleagues and friends Prof. Dr. Johannes B¨ohm, on the occasion of his 90th

birthday, and Prof. Dr. Eike Hertel, on the occasion of his 75th birthday.

Abstract. The notion of ball convexity, considered in ﬁnite dimensional real
Banach spaces, is a natural and useful extension of usual convexity; one re-
places intersections of half-spaces by suitable intersections of balls. A subset
S of a normed space is called ball convex if it coincides with its ball hull,
which is obtained as intersection of all balls (of ﬁxed radius) containing S.
Ball convex sets are closely related to notions like ball polytopes, complete
sets, bodies of constant width, and spindle convexity. We will study geometric
properties of ball convex bodies in normed spaces, for example deriving separa-
tion theorems, characterizations of strictly convex norms, and an application
to complete sets. Our main results refer to minimal representations of ball
convex bodies in terms of their ball exposed faces, to representations of ball
hulls of sets via unions of ball hulls of ﬁnite subsets, and to ball convexity of
increasing unions of ball convex bodies.

1. Introduction

It is well known that generalized convexity notions are helpful for solving various
(metrical) problems from non-Euclidean geometries in an elegant way. For exam-
ple, Menger’s notion of d-segments, yielding that of d-convex sets (see Chapter II of
[16]), is a useful tool for solving location problems in ﬁnite dimensional real Banach
spaces (cf. [36]). Another example, also referring to normed spaces, is the notion of
ball convexity: usual convexity is extended by considering suitably deﬁned intersec-
tions of balls instead of intersections of half-spaces. The ball hull of a given point
set S is the intersection of all balls (of ﬁxed radius) which contain S, and S is called
ball convex if it coincides with its ball hull. Ball convex sets are strongly related
to notions from several recent research topics, such as ball polytopes, applications
of spindle convexity, bodies of constant width, and diametrically maximal (or com-
plete) sets.
In the present article we study geometric properties and (minimal)
representations of ball convex bodies in normed spaces. In terms of ball convexity
and related notions, we derive separation properties of ball convex bodies, vari-
ous characterizations of strictly convex norms, and an application for diametrically
maximal sets, which answers a question from [31].
Introducing suitable notions
describing the boundary structure of ball convex bodies, our main results refer to
minimal representations of ball convex bodies, particularly in terms of their ball

exposed faces. More precisely, we extend the formula K = cl(conv(exp(K))) from
classical convexity (where K is a convex body in Rn) to the concept of ball convex-
ity in normed spaces. On the other hand, we derive theorems on the representation
of ball convex bodies “from inside”. That is, we show that unions of increasing
sequences of ball convex bodies are, essentially, ball convex, and we present ball
hulls of sets by unions of ball hulls of ﬁnite subsets. In that context we solve a
problem from [27]. We ﬁnish with some open questions inspired by the notions
of ball hull and ball convexity; they refer to spindle convex sets and generalized
Minkowski spaces (whose unit balls need not be centered at the origin).

We will give now a brief survey on what has been done regarding ball convexity
and related notions. Intersections of ﬁnitely many congruent Euclidean balls were
studied in [13] and [14], in three dimensions by [22, 23, 50, 21]; see also [34]. The
notions of ball hull and ball convexity have been considered by various authors,
deﬁning them via intersections of balls of some ﬁxed radius R > 0 and calling this
concept also R-convexity; see, e.g., [9, 11, 25, 27]. In view of this concept bodies
of constant width (see [39]), Minkowski sums, Hausdorﬀ limits, and approximation
properties of R-convex sets (cf. [45, 46, 48]) are investigated. Also analogues of the
Krein–Milman theorem and of Carath´eodory’s theorem (see [45, 47]) are considered,
but only for the Euclidean norm. Not much has been done for normed spaces;
however, for related results we refer to [3] for Hilbert spaces and to [5, 1, 4, 33] for
normed spaces. A recent contribution is [27], referring, e.g., to the Banach–Mazur
distance and Hadwiger illumination numbers of sets being ball convex in the sense
described here.

Closely related is the concept of ball polytopes. It was investigated in [10, 25, 44]
(but see also [45], [6, Chapter 6], and [8, Chapter 5]). The boundary structure of
ball polytopes is interesting (digonal facets can occur, and hence their edge-graphs
are diﬀerent from usual polyhedral edge-graphs), their properties are also useful for
constructing bodies of constant width, and analogues of classical theorems like those
of Carath´eodory and Steinitz on linear convex hulls are proved in these papers.

The study of the related notion of spindle convexity (also called hyperconvexity
or K-convexity) was initiated by Mayer [37]; see also [38] and, for Minkowski spaces,
[51, p. 99]. The deﬁnition is given in § 8 below. For a discussion of this notion we
refer to the survey [17, p. 160] and, for further results and references in the spirit of
abstract convexity and combinatorial geometry, to the papers [10, 27, 44, 7, 19] and
[8, Chapters 5 and 6]. In [12] this notion was extended to analogues of starshaped
sets.

To avoid confusion, we shortly mention another concept which is also called ball
convexity. Namely, in [28] a set is called ball convex if, with any ﬁnite number of
points, it contains the intersection of all balls (of arbitrary radii) containing the
points. The ball convex hull of a set S is again deﬁned as the intersection of all ball
convex sets containing S. In [28, 29] this notion was investigated for normed spaces,
and in [30] the relations of these notions to metric or d-convexity are investigated.
The ball hull mapping studied for Banach spaces in [42, 43] is also related.

2. Definitions and notations

Let Kn = {S ⊆ Rn : S is compact, convex, and non-empty} be the set of
all convex bodies in Rn (thus, in our terminology, a convex body need not have
interior points). Let B ∈ Kn be centered at the origin o of Rn and have non-empty

interior. We denote by (Rn,k · k) the n-dimensional normed or Minkowski space
with unit ball B, i.e., the n-dimensional real Banach space whose norm is given by
kxk = min{λ ≥ 0 : x ∈ λB}. Any homothetical copy B(x, r), x ∈ Rn and r ≥ 0, of
B is a closed ball of (Rn,k · k) with center x and radius r; therefore we replace B
by writing from now on B(o, 1) for the unit ball of (Rn,k·k). The boundary of the
ball B(x, r) is the sphere S(x, r), and therefore S(o, 1) denotes the unit sphere of
our Minkowski space. Note that we will use the symbol S for an arbitrarily given
point set in Rn. For a compact S, we write dist(x, S) = min{kx − yk : y ∈ S} for
the distance of x and S, and we denote by rad(S) the circumradius of S, i.e., the
radius of any circumball (or minimal enclosing ball) of S, whose existence is assured
by the boundedness of S. The diameter of S is given by diam(S) = max{kx − yk :
x, y ∈ S}. The triangle inequality yields the left-hand side of
(1)
diam(S) ,

n

diam(S) ≤ rad(S) ≤

n + 1

and we refer to [15, Theorem 6] for the right-hand side.

As usual, we use the abbreviations int(S), cl(S), bd(S), conv(S), and aﬀ(S)
for interior, closure, boundary, convex hull, and aﬃne hull of S, respectively. We
write [x1, x2] for the closed segment with endpoints x1, x2 ∈ Rn, and (a, b), (a, b],
[a, b] are analogously used for the open, half-open or closed interval with a, b ∈ R,
respectively. We use | · | for the cardinality of a set.
A convex body is called strictly convex if its boundary does not contain proper
segments; analogously, k · k is called a strictly convex norm if the respective unit
ball is strictly convex.
Since we want to derive results for generalized convexity notions, the following
deﬁnitions yield direct analogues of notions from classical convexity; see [49]. The
ﬁrst of them is an analogue of the (closed) convex hull. Namely, the ball hull of a
set S is deﬁned by

bh1(S) = \S⊆B(x,1)

B(x, 1) .

A formally clearer expression would be bh1(S) = Tx∈Rn: S⊆B(x,1) B(x, 1), but we

assume that the above shorter notation, as well as similar ones in the sequel, will
not cause confusion. (We underline once more that here and below we use balls
of radius 1.) A ball convex (b-convex ) set S is characterized by S = bh1(S) or,
equivalently, by the property that S is an intersection of closed balls of radius 1
(then S is necessarily closed and convex). A b-convex body K is a bounded non-
empty b-convex set (the analogue of a convex body in classical convexity); ∅ and
Rn are the only b-convex sets that are not b-convex bodies. (Note that Rn is b-
convex, since we want to understand the intersection of an empty family of sets
as Rn.) A supporting sphere S(x, 1) of K is characterized by K ⊆ B(x, 1) and
K ∩ S(x, 1) 6= ∅; the corresponding exposed b-face (or b-support set ) is K ∩ S(x, 1)
(note that non-empty facets from [25, Deﬁnition 5.3] are a special case).
If an exposed b-face is a singleton {x0}, then x0 is called a b-exposed point of
K, and b-exp(K) denotes the set of all b-exposed points. We note that several
such concepts, referring to the analogous notions for ball polytopes, their boundary
structure, separation properties with respect to spheres etc., can be found in the
papers [7, 25], but are deﬁned there only for the subcase of the Euclidean norm.
Finally, a set S is called b-bounded if rad(S) < 1. This means that S is inside a

ball of radius 1 and separated from its bounding sphere, which plays the role of a
hyperplane in classical convexity.

We close this section by summarizing several basic facts about ball hulls and cir-
cumradii, and we give a lemma on intersections of compact sets with the boundaries
of their circumballs.

Lemma 1. Let (Rn,k · k) be a Minkowski space. The following are satisﬁed for all
S, T ⊆ Rn and x ∈ Rn:

bh1(bh1(S)).

(a) S ⊆ cl(S) ⊆ cl(conv(S)) ⊆ bh1(S) = bh1(cl(S)) = bh1(conv(S)) =
(b) If S ⊆ T , then bh1(S) ⊆ bh1(T ).
(c) B(x, r) is a b-convex body for every r ∈ [0, 1].
(d) If rad(S) ≤ 1, then rad(bh1(S)) = rad(S).
(e) If S is closed and S ⊆ int(B(x, r)) for some r > 0, then S ⊆ B(x, r′) for
some r′ ∈ (0, r) and rad(S) < r. In particular, a closed subset of Rn is
b-bounded if and only if it is covered by an open ball of radius 1.

In particular, bh1(S) is b-

bounded if S is b-bounded.

Proof. Parts (a) and (b) are obvious; see [32, Lemma 1] for a collection of related
statements.

For (c), the triangle inequality gives the following representation of B(x, r) as

an intersection of balls of radius 1: B(x, r) =Tky−xk≤1−r B(y, 1).
To see (d), ﬁrst note that rad(S) ≤ rad(bh1(S)) by (a).
If B(x, rad(S)) is a
circumball of S, then bh1(S) ⊆ bh1(B(x, rad(S))) = B(x, rad(S)) by (b) and (c).
Hence rad(bh1(S)) ≤ rad(B(x, rad(S))) = rad(S).
For (e), suppose that S contains at least two points. Consider the continuous
function f : S → R, f (y) = dist(y, S(x, r)) = dist(y, Rn \ B(x, r)). Since S is
compact, f attains its minimum: f (y) ≥ f (y0) ∈ (0, r) for all y ∈ S. This shows
that dist(y, Rn \ B(x, r)) ≥ f (y0) for all y ∈ S; i.e., S ⊆ B(x, r′), where r′ =
r − f (y0) ∈ (0, r).

(cid:3)

Lemma 2. Let B(x0, rad(S)) be a circumball of a non-empty compact subset S of
a Minkowski space (Rn,k·k). Then rad(S ∩ S(x0, rad(S))) = rad(S). In particular,
there exist x, x′ ∈ S ∩ S(x0, rad(S)) such that kx − x′k ≥ n+1
Proof. Without loss of generality, we set B(x0, rad(S)) = B(o, 1). Assume that,
contrary to our claim, rad(S ∩ S(o, 1)) < 1. Then there exists x1 ∈ Rn such that

S ∩ S(o, 1) ⊆ int(B(x1, 1)).

Since S \ int(B(x1, 1)) is compact, (yi)∞i=1 has an accumulation point y0 ∈ S \
int(B(x1, 1)). We know that ky0k ≤ 1 from S ⊆ B(o, 1), whereas (3) gives
(cid:13)(cid:13)yi − 1
i x1(cid:13)(cid:13) ≥ 1 and, by i → ∞, ky0k ≥ 1. This way we see that
which contradicts (2) and completes the proof of rad(S ∩ S(x0, rad(S))) = rad(S).
Now the additionally claimed existence of x, x′ ∈ S ∩ S(x0, rad(S)) such that

compactness of S.

3. Separation properties

The following results on the separation of b-convex bodies and points by spheres
are analogues of theorems on the separation by hyperplanes in classical convexity.
Proposition 1. Let K be a b-convex body in a Minkowski space (Rn,k · k).

(a) For every x0 ∈ bd(K), there exists a supporting sphere S(y0, 1) of K such
(b) For every x0 ∈ Rn \ K, there exists a supporting sphere S(y0, 1) of K such
(c) If K is b-bounded then, for every x0 ∈ Rn \ K, there exists a sphere of

that x0 /∈ B(y0, 1).
unit radius S(y0, 1) such that K ⊆ int(B(y0, 1)) and x0 /∈ B(y0, 1).
particular, K ⊆ B(y0, r) for some r ∈ (0, 1).

Proof. For proving (a), note that the assumption

x0 ∈ bd(K) = bd(bh1(K)) = bd

 \K⊆B(y,1)

B(y, 1)

(1 − kx0 − yik).

yields the existence of a sequence (yi)∞i=1 ⊆ Rn such that K ⊆ B(yi, 1) for all i and

0 = lim
i→∞

dist(x0, Rn \ B(yi, 1)) = lim
i→∞

By compactness, (yi)∞i=1 has a convergent subsequence, and we can assume that
limi→∞ yi = y0 without loss of generality. Then the above observations imply
K ⊆ B(y0, 1) and kx0 − y0k = 1, i.e., x0 ∈ S(y0, 1). This is our claim.
For (b), we have x0 /∈ K = TK⊆B(y,1) B(y, 1). Hence there is y1 ∈ Rn such
that K ⊆ B(y1, 1) and x0 /∈ B(y1, 1). We consider the translated balls Bλ :=
B(y1 + λ(y1 − x0), 1), λ ≥ 0. We know that K ⊆ B0. Let λ0 ≥ 0 be maximal such
that

K ⊆ Bλ

for

0 ≤ λ ≤ λ0.

6

THOMAS JAHN, HORST MARTINI, AND CHRISTIAN RICHTER

By the maximality of λ0, bd(Bλ0 ) = S(y1+λ0(y1−x0), 1) =: S(y0, 1) is a supporting
sphere of K. Moreover, x0 /∈ B(y0, 1), because x0 /∈ B(y1, 1) gives

kx0 − y0k = kx0 − (y1 + λ0(y1 − x0))k = (1 + λ0)kx0 − y1k > 1 + λ0 ≥ 1.

This proves (b).

For the proof of (c), the b-boundedness of K gives y1 ∈ Rn such that K ⊆
int(B(y1, 1)). By (b), there is y2 ∈ Rn with K ⊆ B(y2, 1) and x0 /∈ B(y2, 1). We
can pick ε ∈ (0, 1) small enough such that
where

x0 /∈ B(y0, 1),

y0 := y2 + ε(y1 − y2).

Then we obtain

(4)
because, for arbitrary x ∈ K, the inclusions K ⊆ int(B(y1, 1)) and K ⊆ B(y2, 1)
imply kx − y1k < 1, kx − y2k ≤ 1, and in turn

K ⊆ int(B(y0, 1)),

kx − y0k = kx − (y2 + ε(y1 − y2))k

= kε(x − y1) + (1 − ε)(x − y2)k
≤ εkx − y1k + (1 − ε)kx − y2k
< ε + (1 − ε)
= 1.

Finally, (4) yields K ⊆ B(y0, r) for suitable r ∈ (0, 1) by Lemma 1(e).
Corollary 1. Every b-convex body in a Minkowski space (Rn,k · k) satisﬁes

(cid:3)

bd(K) =[{F : F is an exposed b-face of K}.

Proof. Proposition 1(a) gives “⊆”. The converse inclusion is implied by the deﬁni-
tion of exposed b-faces.

(cid:3)

Proposition 1 gives rise to alternative representations of ball hulls.

Corollary 2. Every b-bounded subset S of a Minkowski space (Rn,k · k) satisﬁes

bh1(S) =

\S⊆int(B(x,1))

B(x, 1) =

\S⊆B(x,r),r<1

B(x, 1) =

\S⊆B(x,r),r<1

B(x, r).

Proof. We assume that S 6= ∅ and put A := bh1(S) = TS⊆B(x,1) B(x, 1), B :=
TS⊆int(B(x,1)) B(x, 1), C := TS⊆B(x,r),r<1 B(x, 1) and D :=TS⊆B(x,r),r<1 B(x, r).
The inclusions A ⊆ B ⊆ C and D ⊆ C are trivial. It suﬃces to prove that C ⊆ A
and A ⊆ D.
For proving C ⊆ A, we consider an arbitrary x0 ∈ Rn \ A and have to show that
x0 /∈ C. Application of Proposition 1(c) to A, which is b-bounded by Lemma 1(d),
and x0 gives y0 ∈ Rn and r ∈ (0, 1) such that S ⊆ A ⊆ B(y0, r) and x0 /∈ B(y0, 1).
This yields x0 /∈ C.

For A ⊆ D, note that

S ⊆ B(x, r) ⇔ A ⊆ B(x, r).

Indeed, if S ⊆ B(x, r), then, by Lemma 1(b) and (c), A = bh1(S) ⊆ bh1(B(x, r)) =
B(x, r). Conversely, if A ⊆ B(x, r), then S ⊆ bh1(S) = A ⊆ B(x, r) by Lemma 1(a).

BALL CONVEX BODIES IN MINKOWSKI SPACES

The above equivalence yields

A ⊆

\A⊆B(x,r),r<1

B(x, r) =

\S⊆B(x,r),r<1

B(x, r) = D.

(cid:3)

Corollary 3. Every b-bounded closed subset S of a Minkowski space (Rn,k · k)
satisﬁes

bh1(S) =

\S⊆int(B(x,1))

int(B(x, 1)).

Proof. By Corollary 2,

bh1(S) =

\S⊆int(B(x,1))

B(x, 1) ⊇

\S⊆int(B(x,1))

int(B(x, 1)).

For the converse inclusion, note that

S ⊆ int(B(x, 1)) ⇒ bh1(S) ⊆ int(B(x, 1)).

Indeed, if S ⊆ int(B(x, 1)), then S ⊆ B(x, r) for some r ∈ (0, 1) by Lemma 1(e),
and, by Lemma 1(b) and (c), bh1(S) ⊆ bh1(B(x, r)) = B(x, r) ⊆ int(B(x, 1)).

The above implication yields

\S⊆int(B(x,1))

int(B(x, 1)) ⊇

\

bh1(S)⊆int(B(x,1))

int(B(x, 1)) ⊇ bh1(S).

(cid:3)

The assumption of b-boundedness is essential in Corollaries 2 and 3. For ex-
ample, if S is a closed ball of radius 1, then bh1(S) = S, whereas the four other
intersections represent Rn, since they are intersections over empty index sets.

To see that the assumption of closedness in Corollary 3 cannot be dropped,

consider the example S = int(B(x0, r0)) with x0 ∈ Rn and r0 ∈ (0, 1). Then

bh1(int(B(x0, r0))) = bh1(B(x0, r0)) = B(x0, r0)

by Lemma 1(a) and (c). In contrast to that,

\

int(B(x0,r0))⊆int(B(x,1))

int(B(x, 1)) =

\kx−x0k≤1−r0

as can be checked by the triangle inequality.

int(B(x, 1)) = int(B(x0, r0)),

In classical convexity two disjoint convex sets can be separated by a hyperplane.
The analogous claim for ball convexity would say that, given two disjoint b-convex
bodies K1, K2 ⊆ Rn, there exists a separating sphere S(x0, 1) for K1 and K2;
i.e., K1 ⊆ B(x0, 1) and K2 ∩ B(x0, 1) = ∅. In fact, one knows even more if the
underlying Minkowski space (Rn,k · k) is a Euclidean space (see [10, Lemma 3.1
and Corollary 3.4]), if its unit ball is a cube (see [27, Corollary 3.15]), or if it
is two-dimensional (see [27, Theorem 4]). Then, for every b-convex body K and
every supporting hyperplane H of K, there exists a sphere S(x0, 1) such that K ⊆
B(x0, 1) and int(B(x0, 1))∩H = ∅. However, the last statement fails in general (see
[27, Example 3.9] for an example in a generalized Minkowski space whose unit ball is
not centrally symmetric). Here we show that even the (formally weaker) separation
of two b-convex bodies by a unit sphere may fail in a (symmetric) Minkowski space.

Some of our results will require strict convexity of the norm k · k. On the other
hand, strict convexity can be reﬂected by numerous properties related to concepts
introduced in Section 2. This fourth section here is devoted to characterizations of
strict convexity. We start with characterizations by properties of balls, circumballs
and circumradii; for (iv) and (v) in the following lemma we also refer to [2, 35].

radius r > 0 is smaller than r.

(iv) Every bounded non-empty subset of Rn has a unique circumball.
(v) For any two distinct points x1, x2 ∈ Rn, {x1, x2} has a unique circumball.
Proof. (i)⇒(ii): If (ii) fails, then some ball meets one of its supporting hyperplanes
in at least two distinct points x1, x2. Then the segment [x1, x2] is contained in the
boundary of that ball, contradicting (i).

(ii)⇒(i): If (i) fails, then the boundary of B(o, 1) contains a line segment L of
positive length. The disjoint convex sets int(B(o, 1)) and L can be separated by
a hyperplane H. Then H is a supporting hyperplane of B(o, 1) and contains L,
contradicting (ii).

(cid:13)(cid:13)x − x1+x2
2 (cid:13)(cid:13) = r. This shows that [x1, x2] is a segment in S(x, r), contradicting (i)

hence all terms in the above estimate agree and we obtain kx − x1k = kx − x2k =

0 that has two circumballs B(x1, rad(S)) and B(x2, rad(S)), x1 6= x2. This implies
B(x1, rad(S))∩B(x2, rad(S)) ⊇ S and rad(B(x1, rad(S))∩B(x2, rad(S))) ≥ rad(S),

Now we come to characterizations of strict convexity of norms in terms of con-

(cid:3)

cepts related to b-convexity that are deﬁned in Section 2.
Proposition 2. Let (Rn,k·k) be a Minkowski space. The following are equivalent:

(i) The norm k · k is strictly convex.
(vi) Every b-convex body that is not b-bounded is a closed ball of radius 1.
(vii) Every b-convex body that is not b-bounded has only one supporting sphere.
(viii) For every boundary point x of a b-convex body K that is not b-bounded,

there exists only one supporting sphere of K that contains x.

only one supporting sphere that contains x0.

B(x, r) has only one supporting sphere that contains x0.

(ix) For every x ∈ Rn, every r ∈ (0, 1) and every x0 ∈ bd(B(x, r)), B(x, r) has
(x) There exist x ∈ Rn and r ∈ (0, 1) such that, for every x0 ∈ bd(B(x, r)),
(xi) For every x ∈ Rn and every r ∈ (0, 1), each supporting sphere of B(x, r)
(xii) There exist x ∈ Rn and r ∈ (0, 1) such that each supporting sphere of
(xiii) For every x ∈ Rn and every r ∈ (0, 1), b-exp(B(x, r)) = S(x, r).
(xiv) There exist x ∈ Rn and r ∈ (0, 1) such that b-exp(B(x, r)) = S(x, r).
(xv) Every b-convex body is strictly convex.
(xvi) For any two distinct points x1, x2 ∈ Rn, bh1({x1, x2}) is strictly convex.
(xvii) Every b-convex body that contains at least two points has non-empty inte-

B(x, r) meets B(x, r) in only one point.

rior.

(xviii) For any two distinct points x1, x2 ∈ Rn, int(bh1({x1, x2})) is non-empty.
Proof. The implications (vi)⇒(vii)⇒(viii), (ix)⇒(x), (xi)⇒(xii), (xiii)⇒(xiv),
(xv)⇒(xvi), and (xvii)⇒(xviii) are obvious.
(i)⇒(vi): Every b-convex body K is a non-empty intersection of a non-empty
family of closed balls of radius 1. If the family consisted of more than one ball,
then its intersection K would be b-bounded by Lemma 3(i)⇒(iii). Hence the only
b-convex bodies that are not b-bounded are closed balls of radius 1.
(viii)⇒(i): Suppose that (i) fails. Then condition (iii) from Lemma 3 fails as
well, and there are two points x1 6= x2 such that rad(B(x1, 1) ∩ B(x2, 1)) = 1.
The body K = B(x1, 1) ∩ B(x2, 1) shows that (viii) fails, too, because every x ∈
bd(B(x1, 1)) ∩ bd(B(x2, 1)) belongs to bd(K) and has the two supporting spheres
S(x1, 1) and S(x2, 1).
(i)⇒(ix) and (i)⇒(xi): We use the fact that if two balls B(y, s) and B(y′, s′)
of positive radii in a strictly convex Minkowski space are on the same side of a
common supporting hyperplane H with respective touching points y0 and y′0, then
the dilatation ϕ that is uniquely determined by ϕ(y0) = y′0 and the dilatation factor
s′
s maps B(y, s) onto B(y′, s′). To see this, consider the homotheties δ and δ′ that
map B(y, s) and B(y′, s′) onto B(o, 1), respectively. Then δ(H) = δ′(H), because
B(o, 1) has only one supporting hyperplane with the same outer normal vector as
H, and δ(y0) = δ′(y′0), since δ(H) = δ′(H) has only one touching point with B(o, 1)
(see Lemma 3). Now ϕ = (δ′)−1 ◦ δ, and the fact is veriﬁed.
Coming back to the proof of (i)⇒(ix) and (i)⇒(xi), we consider an arbitrary
supporting sphere S(y, 1) of B(x, r) and suppose that x0 belongs to the b-support
set B(x, r) ∩ S(y, 1). The supporting hyperplane of B(y, 1) at x0 supports B(x, r)

10

as well. Now the above fact says that B(y, 1) is the image of B(x, r) under the
dilatation ϕ with ﬁxed point x0 and factor 1
r . This shows in particular that the
supporting sphere S(y, 1) is uniquely determined by the touching point x0, which
proves (ix) (because there exists at least one supporting sphere at x0 according to
Proposition 1(a)). To show (xi), we have to prove that every point x1 ∈ B(x, r) ∩
S(y, 1) coincides with x0. By the same argument as above, B(y, 1) is the image of
B(x, r) under the dilatation ψ with ﬁxed point x1 and factor 1

r . We obtain

y = ϕ(x) = x0 +

r

(x − x0)

and

y = ψ(x) = x1 +

1
r

(x − x1),

which gives x0 = x1 and completes the proof of (xi).

(x)⇒(i): Suppose that (i) fails. Then, for every x ∈ Rn and every r ∈ (0, 1),
If ϕ0 and ϕ1 are
r and ﬁxed points x0 and x1, respectively, then ϕ0(S(x, r))

S(x, r) contains a line segment [x0, x1] ⊆ S(x, r), x0 6= x1.
dilatations with factor 1
and ϕ1(S(x, r)) are distinct supporting spheres of B(x, r). Clearly, we have

x0 = ϕ0(x0) ∈ ϕ0([x0, x1]) ⊆ ϕ0(S(x, r)).

Moreover,

x0 = ϕ1(rx0 + (1 − r)x1) ∈ ϕ1([x0, x1]) ⊆ ϕ1(S(x, r)).

Hence ϕ0(S(x, r)) and ϕ1(S(x, r)) both are supporting spheres of B(x, r) at x0 ∈
bd(B(x, r)), and (x) is disproved.

2 must necessarily cover the whole segment [x1, x2]. Thus x1+x2

(xi)⇒(xiii) and (xii)⇒(xiv) follow from Proposition 1(a).
(xiv)⇒(i): If (i) fails, then every ball B(x, r), x ∈ Rn, r ∈ (0, 1), contains a
segment [x1, x2], x1 6= x2, in its boundary S(x, r). We shall show that x1+x2
/∈
b-exp(B(x, r)), this way disproving (xiv). Indeed, if S(y, 1) is a supporting sphere
of B(x, r) with touching point x1+x2
∈ S(y, 1), then [x1, x2] ⊆ B(x, r) ⊆ B(y, 1),
and the point x1+x2
(from the relative interior) of [x1, x2] is in S(y, 1) = bd(B(y, 1)).
Hence [x1, x2] ⊆ S(y, 1). This shows that the exposed b-face B(x, r) ∩ S(y, 1) that
contains x1+x2
/∈
b-exp(B(x, r)).
(i)⇒(xv): Assume that (xv) fails; i.e., there are a b-convex body K and two
points x1 6= x2 such that [x1, x2] ⊆ bd(K). By Proposition 1(a), there is a support-
ing sphere S(y, 1) of K such that x1+x2
∈ S(y, 1). As above, we have [x1, x2] ⊆
K ⊆ B(y, 1) and x1+x2
∈ S(y, 1) = bd(B(y, 1)), which yields [x1, x2] ⊆ S(y, 1) and
contradicts (i).
(xv)⇒(xvii) and (xvi)⇒(xviii): If a convex body K contains two distinct points
x1 and x2 and has empty interior, then K is not strictly convex, because [x1, x2] ⊆
K = bd(K). This yields the two implications.
(xviii)⇒(i): If (i) fails, then there are x1 6= x2 such that [x1, x2] ⊆ S(o, 1). Hence

5. Representation of ball hulls “from inside”

In this section we deal with b-convexity of unions of increasing sequences of b-
convex bodies and with the representation of ball hulls of sets by unions of ball
hulls of ﬁnite subsets. We start with an auxiliary statement.
Lemma 4. Let K ∈ Kn, let H ⊆ Rn be a hyperplane, and let (yi)∞i=1 ⊆ Rn such
i→∞−→ y0 ∈ Rn and H ∩ (K + yi) 6= ∅ for all i = 1, 2, . . . Then H ∩ (K + yi) i→∞−→
that yi
H ∩ (K + y0) in the Hausdorﬀ distance.
Proof. First note that H ∩ (K + y0) 6= ∅, and in turn H ∩ (K + y0) ∈ Kn. Indeed,
for every i ≥ 1, we can pick zi ∈ H ∩ (K + yi), i.e., zi = xi + yi with xi ∈ K. By the
i→∞−→ x0 ∈ K. We get z0 := x0 + y0 =
compactness of K we see that, w.l.o.g., xi
limi→∞ zi ∈ H ∩ (K + y0), because H is closed.
By [49, Theorem 1.8.7], our claim H∩(K +yi) i→∞−→ H∩(K +y0) is now equivalent
(a) for every t0 ∈ H ∩ (K + y0), there exist ti ∈ H ∩ (K + yi), i = 1, 2, . . . , such

to the following conditions taken together:

i→∞−→ t0;

that ti

j→∞−→ t0 ∈ Rn, then t0 ∈ H ∩ (K + y0).

Proof of (a). Suppose that H = {x ∈ Rn : hu, xi = c}, h·,·i denoting the usual

scalar product. Then ﬁx t0 ∈ H ∩ (K + y0), i.e., t0 = x0 + y0 with x0 ∈ K and

Pick x∗, x∗∗ ∈ K such that

hu, x∗i = min{hu, xi : x ∈ K},

hu, x∗∗i = max{hu, xi : x ∈ K} .

For every i = 1, 2, . . . , H ∩ (K + yi) 6= ∅ gives ˜xi ∈ K such that
(7)
We choose ti = xi + yi ∈ H ∩ (K + yi) as follows: We know from ˜xi ∈ K that
hu, ˜xii ∈ [hu, x∗i,hu, x∗∗i].

hu, ˜xi + yii = c .

Case 1: hu, ˜xii = hu, x0i.

In that case we put

xi := x0 .

Then ti = x0 +yi ∈ K +yi and ti ∈ H, because hu, tii = hu, x0 +yii = hu, ˜xi +yii

hu, x0i − hu, x∗ihu, x∗i = hu, ˜xii .

hu, xii = hu, ˜xii − hu, x∗i

satisﬁes xi ∈ [x0, x∗] ⊆ K, hence ti = xi + yi ∈ K + yi, and
hu, x0i − hu, x∗ihu, x0i + hu, x0i − hu, ˜xii
This gives ti ∈ H, because hu, tii = hu, xi + yii = hu, ˜xi + yii

Case 3: hu, ˜xii ∈ (hu, x0i,hu, x∗∗i]. Then

(10)

xi := hu, x∗∗i − hu, ˜xii
hu, x∗∗i − hu, x0i

x0 + hu, ˜xii − hu, x0i
hu, x∗∗i − hu, x0i
satisﬁes xi ∈ [x0, x∗∗] ⊆ K, hence ti = xi + yi ∈ K + yi, and

This yields ti ∈ H, because hu, tii = hu, xi + yii = hu, ˜xi + yii
i→∞−→ x0
by partitioning the sequence (xi)∞i=1 into three subsequences corresponding to the
above Cases 1–3, where each of the subsequences (if it is inﬁnite) converges to x0.
In Case 1 this is trivial, and in the other two cases it follows from

i→∞−→ t0, we use the following arguments. We get xi

(7)
= c.

= hu, x0i
and from the deﬁnitions (9) and (10). This yields ti = xi + yi

i→∞−→ x0 + y0 = t0.

Proof of (b). The inclusion tij ∈ H ∩ (K + yij ) gives xij := tij − yij ∈ K. Hence
j→∞−→ t0 − y0 ∈ K, because K is closed. Thus t0 ∈ K + y0. Moreover,

xij = tij − yij
tij ∈ H yields tij
Remark 1. Note that H cannot be replaced by an aﬃne subspace L of arbitrary
dimension in Lemma 4. See the following example, where

i→∞−→ t0 ∈ H, because H is closed. Hence t0 ∈ H ∩ (K + y0).

i , 0(cid:1) i→∞−→ y0 = (0, 0, 0). Then L ∩ (K + yi) = {(1, 0, 0)}
yi := (1, 0, 0) −(cid:0)cos 1
for any i, and L ∩ (K + y0) = L ∩ K = [(1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1)]. Hence L ∩ (K + yi) does
not converge to L ∩ (K + y0) in the described way.

Proof. Since “⊆” in (12) is obvious, we prove now “⊇”.
Case 1: For dim(aﬀ(bh1(S∞i=1 Ci))) = 0, S∞i=1 Ci = {x0} is a singleton. Thus
Ci = {x0} for all i = 1, 2, . . . , and (12) is trivial.
Case 2: For dim(aﬀ(bh1(S∞i=1 Ci))) = 1, bh1(S∞i=1 Ci) is a line segment. Since
every closed line segment of the same direction and having smaller length is also
b-convex, each Ci is a closed segment of that kind (perhaps of length 0), S∞i=1 Ci

is a segment of that direction (not necessarily closed), and

is the interior in the natural topology of H), whereas bh1(S∞i=1 Ci) ⊆ B(y0, 1) ∩ H
by (15) and the choice of H. With this and the choice of H we obtain x1 /∈

“⊇” in (12) is complete.
To show that cl(S∞i=1 Ci) = bh1(S∞i=1 Ci) is a b-convex body, it is enough to
verify that bh1(S∞i=1 Ci) 6= Rn, i.e., thatS∞i=1 Ci is contained in some ball of radius

Proof. Situation (i) is trivial. In situation (ii), Proposition 2 ((i) ⇔ (xvii)) shows
that dim(aﬀ(bh1(S∞i=1 Ci))) = n as soon as S∞i=1 Ci is not a singleton. Condition

C1 ⊆ C2 ⊆ . . . If Ci0 is not a b-convex body for some i0, then bh1({x1, . . . , xi0}) =

The claim of Theorem 2 is shown in [27, Theorem 1] under the stronger assump-

tion can be dropped. Our generalization to the additional cases dim(aﬀ(bh1(S))) ∈

orem 2 are essential, which shows that the answer to Problem 2.6 from [27] is
negative.
Example 2. We denote the Euclidean norm by k · k2 and consider convex bodies

K = {(κ1, κ2, κ3, 0) : k(κ1, κ2)k2 ≤ 1,k(κ2, κ3)k2 ≤ 1},
L = {(λ1, 0, λ3, λ4) : k(λ1, λ4)k2 ≤ 1,|λ3| ≤ 1}

in R4. We deﬁne the unit ball B(o, 1) = B of a Minkowski space (R4,k · k) by

B = conv(K ∪ L)

= {(κ1 + λ1, ξ2, κ3 + λ3, ξ4) :

max{k(κ1, ξ2)k2,k(ξ2, κ3)k2} + max{k(λ1, ξ4)k2,|λ3|} ≤ 1}.

For that space we shall see that

bh1({(α, 0, 0, 0), (−α, 0, 0, 0)}) = [(α, 0, 0, 0), (−α, 0, 0, 0)] for α ∈ (0, 1)

(19)

(20)

and

(21)

bh1({(1, 0, 0, 0), (−1, 0, 0, 0)}) = {(ξ1, 0, 0, ξ4) : k(ξ1, ξ4)k2 ≤ 1}.

Consequently, the segments Ci =(cid:2)(cid:0)1 − 1

form an increasing sequence of b-convex bodies, and we obtain

i , 0, 0, 0(cid:1)(cid:3), i = 1, 2, . . .,

i , 0, 0, 0(cid:1) ,(cid:0)−1 + 1
Ci! = [(1, 0, 0, 0), (−1, 0, 0, 0)],
Ci! = {(ξ1, 0, 0, ξ4) : k(ξ1, ξ4)k2 ≤ 1}.

cl  ∞
[i=1
bh1  ∞
[i=1

Hence (12) fails and cl(S∞i=1 Ci) is not b-convex.
Similarly, the relatively open segment S = ((1, 0, 0, 0), (−1, 0, 0, 0)) satisﬁes

cl
 [F⊆S ﬁnite

bh1(S) = {(ξ1, 0, 0, ξ4) : k(ξ1, ξ4)k2 ≤ 1},
bh1(F )

 = [(1, 0, 0, 0), (−1, 0, 0, 0)],

and (17) fails.
Proof of (20) and (21). Step 1. Veriﬁcation of (20). Let α ∈ (0, 1) be ﬁxed. We
use the linear functional

f (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ4) =p1 − α2 ξ2 + αξ3 =D(cid:16)p1 − α2, α(cid:17) , (ξ2, ξ3)E

of Euclidean norm kfk2 = (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:0)√1 − α2, α(cid:1)(cid:13)(cid:13)2 = 1, and we deﬁne related level and

sublevel sets f=µ, f≤µ, f≥µ by

f=/≤/≥µ = {x ∈ R4 : f (x) = / ≤ / ≥ µ}.
We obtain, partially based on the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality,

K ⊆ f≥−1 ∩ f≤1, L ⊆ f≥−α ∩ f≤α, L ∩ f=1 = ∅.

16

THOMAS JAHN, HORST MARTINI, AND CHRISTIAN RICHTER

These yield

B ⊆ f≥−1 ∩ f≤1

(22)

and

(23)

{(α, 0, 0, 0), (−α, 0, 0, 0)}

B ∩ f=1 = K ∩ f=1 =h(cid:16)α,p1 − α2, α, 0(cid:17) ,(cid:16)−α,p1 − α2, α, 0(cid:17)i .

Next note that (cid:0)±α,±√1 − α2,±α, 0(cid:1) ∈ K ⊆ B for arbitrary choice of signs.
This implies (±α, 0, 0, 0) ∈ B +(cid:0)0,±√1 − α2,±α, 0(cid:1), in particular
⊆ B(cid:16)(cid:16)0,p1 − α2, α, 0(cid:17) , 1(cid:17) ∩ B(cid:16)(cid:16)0,−p1 − α2,−α, 0(cid:17) , 1(cid:17) ,

and in turn
bh1({(α, 0, 0, 0), (−α, 0, 0, 0)})
⊆ B(cid:16)(cid:16)0,p1 − α2, α, 0(cid:17) , 1(cid:17) ∩ B(cid:16)(cid:16)0,−p1 − α2,−α, 0(cid:17) , 1(cid:17)
= (cid:16)(B ∩ f≥−1) +(cid:16)0,p1 − α2, α, 0(cid:17)(cid:17) ∩(cid:16)(B ∩ f≤1) +(cid:16)0,−p1 − α2,−α, 0(cid:17)(cid:17)
= (cid:16)B +(cid:16)0,p1 − α2, α, 0(cid:17)(cid:17) ∩ f≥0 ∩(cid:16)B +(cid:16)0,−p1 − α2,−α, 0(cid:17)(cid:17) ∩ f≤0
⊆ (cid:16)B +(cid:16)0,−p1 − α2,−α, 0(cid:17)(cid:17) ∩ f=0
= (B ∩ f=1) +(cid:16)0,−p1 − α2,−α, 0(cid:17)
= [(α, 0, 0, 0), (−α, 0, 0, 0)].
This gives the inclusion “⊆” in (20). The reverse inclusion is obvious, since the ball
hull is closed and convex.

(22)

(23)

Step 2. Veriﬁcation of the equivalence of

(24)

with

(25)

{(1, 0, 0, 0), (−1, 0, 0, 0)} ⊆ B(t, 1) = B + t

t = (0, 0, τ3, 0)

with

τ3 ∈ [−1, 1].

Suppose that t = (τ1, τ2, τ3, τ4) satisﬁes (24). The inclusion B = conv(K ∪ L) ⊆

conv([−1, 1]4) = [−1, 1]4 together with (24) gives
(26)
Now the assumption (−1, 0, 0, 0) ∈ B + t amounts to (−1,−τ2,−τ3,−τ4) ∈ B and,
by symmetry, to (1, τ2, τ3, τ4) ∈ B. By (19), this says that there are κ1, λ1, κ3, λ3 ∈
R such that κ1 + λ1 = 1, κ3 + λ3 = τ3 and

τ3 ∈ [−1, 1].

τ1 = 0

and

(27)

max{k(κ1, τ2)k2,k(τ2, κ3)k2} + max{k(λ1, τ4)k2,|λ3|} ≤ 1.

From κ1 + λ1 = 1 we obtain

1 ≤ |κ1| + |λ1| ≤ k(κ1, τ2)k2 + k(λ1, τ4)k2
Hence all inequalities in the last formula are identities and

(27)

≤ 1.

τ2 = τ4 = 0.
By (26), the implication “(24)⇒(25)” is proved.

BALL CONVEX BODIES IN MINKOWSKI SPACES

17

This is an obvious consequence of (±1, 0,−τ3, 0) ∈ L ⊆ B.

The converse “(25)⇒(24)” amounts to (±1, 0,−τ3, 0) ∈ B for all τ3 ∈ [−1, 1].
Note that the equivalence “(24)⇔(25)” implies
bh1({(1, 0, 0, 0), (−1, 0, 0, 0)}) = \τ3∈[−1,1]

(B + (0, 0, τ3, 0)).

(28)

Step 3. Veriﬁcation of “⊆” from (21). Here the functional

g(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ4) = ξ3

satisﬁes K ∪ L ⊆ g≥−1 ∩ g≤1. Hence
(29)

B ⊆ g≥−1 ∩ g≤1

and

B ∩ g=1 = conv((K ∩ g=1) ∪ (L ∩ g=1))

= conv({(ξ1, 0, 1, 0) : |ξ1| ≤ 1} ∪ {ξ1, 0, 1, ξ4) : k(ξ1, ξ4)k2 ≤ 1})
= {ξ1, 0, 1, ξ4) : k(ξ1, ξ4)k2 ≤ 1}.

(30)
Now we obtain the claim “⊆” from (21) by

bh1({(1, 0, 0, 0), (−1, 0, 0, 0)})

(28)

(29)

⊆ (B + (0, 0, 1, 0)) ∩ (B + (0, 0,−1, 0))
= ((B ∩ g≥−1) + (0, 0, 1, 0)) ∩ ((B ∩ g≤1) + (0, 0,−1, 0))
= (B + (0, 0, 1, 0)) ∩ g≥0 ∩ (B + (0, 0,−1, 0)) ∩ g≤0
⊆ (B + (0, 0,−1, 0)) ∩ g=0
= (B ∩ g=1) + (0, 0,−1, 0)
= {(ξ1, 0, 0, ξ4) : k(ξ1, ξ4)k2 ≤ 1}.

(30)

Step 4. Veriﬁcation of “⊇” from (21).

k(ξ1, ξ4)k2 ≤ 1 and |τ3| ≤ 1. Then (ξ1, 0,−τ3, ξ4) ∈ L ⊆ B. Thus

Let ξ1, ξ4, τ3 ∈ R be such that

(ξ1, 0, 0, ξ4) ∈ B + (0, 0, τ3, 0)

if

k(ξ1, ξ4)k2 ≤ 1, |τ3| ≤ 1.

By (28), this implies “⊇” from (21).

6. Minimal representation of ball convex bodies as ball hulls

In this section we will present, as announced, minimal representations of ball

convex bodies in terms oft their ball exposed faces.
Theorem 3. Let K be a b-bounded b-convex body in a Minkowski space (Rn,k · k)
and let S ⊆ K. Then bh1(S) = K if and only if every exposed b-face of K meets
cl(S).

Proof. For the proof of “⇒”, suppose that there is an exposed b-face F of K such
that F ∩ cl(S) = ∅. We have to show that bh1(S) 6= K. The b-face F has a
representation F = K ∩ S(y, 1), where S(y, 1) is a supporting sphere of K. By
F ∩ cl(S) = ∅, we obtain cl(S) ⊆ int(B(y, 1)) and, by Lemma 1(e), cl(S) ⊆ B(y, r)
for some r < 1. We ﬁx x0 ∈ F . Then kx0 − yk = 1, because F ⊆ S(y, 1), and

18

THOMAS JAHN, HORST MARTINI, AND CHRISTIAN RICHTER

x0 /∈ B(y−(1−r)(x0−y), 1), since kx0−(y−(1−r)(x0−y))k = (2−r)kx0−yk > 1.
But S ⊆ B(y, r) ⊆ B(y − (1 − r)(x0 − y), 1) by the triangle inequality. Thus

x0 /∈ B(y − (1 − r)(x0 − y), 1) ⊇ bh1(S)

and

x0 ∈ F ⊆ K,

showing that bh1(S) 6= K.
For the converse implication “⇐”, we suppose that bh1(S) 6= K and will show
that cl(S) misses at least one exposed b-face F0 of K. Since bh1(S) 6= K and
bh1(S) ⊆ K by Lemma 1, there is x0 ∈ K \ bh1(S). By Proposition 1(b), we can
separate x0 from the b-convex body bh1(S) ⊆ K by a sphere S(y0, 1),
(31)
and
The b-boundedness of K gives y1 ∈ Rn such that
(32)
We consider the balls Bλ := B(y0 + λ(y1 − y0), 1) for λ ∈ [0, 1]. Then K 6⊆ B0 by
(31) and K ⊆ B1 by (32). Consequently, there exists

cl(S) ⊆ K ⊆ int(B(y1, 1)).

cl(S) ⊆ bh1(S) ⊆ B(y0, 1)

x0 /∈ B(y0, 1).

λ0 = min{λ ∈ [0, 1] : K ⊆ Bλ} ∈ (0, 1].

(It is a consequence of the continuity of k·k that λ0 is really attained as a minimum.)
By the deﬁnition of λ0 and a compactness argument, the set F0 = K ∩ bd(Bλ0 )
is non-empty, so that Sλ0 := bd(Bλ0 ) is a supporting sphere of K and F0 is an
exposed b-face.

Now it remains to show that F0 ∩ cl(S) = ∅. Suppose that this is not the case;
i.e., there exists z0 ∈ F0 ∩ cl(S). The inclusions (31) and (32) yield kz0 − y0k ≤ 1
and kz0 − y1k < 1. Finally, the inclusion z0 ∈ F0 ⊆ Sλ0 = S(y0 + λ0(y1 − y0), 1)
gives

1 = kz0 − (y0 + λ0(y1 − y0))k

= kλ0(z0 − y1) + (1 − λ0)(z0 − y0)k
≤ λ0kz0 − y1k + (1 − λ0)kz0 − y0k
< λ0 + (1 − λ0)
= 1.

This contradiction completes the proof.

(cid:3)

Note that the proof of “⇒” did not require b-boundedness of K. However, b-
boundedness is essential for “⇐”. To see this, consider a closed ball K = B(y, 1) of
radius 1. (Proposition 2(i)⇒(vi) says that these are the only b-convex bodies that
are not b-bounded, provided that the norm k · k is strictly convex.) Then the only
supporting sphere of K is S(y, 1), and the only exposed b-face is F = K ∩ S(y, 1) =
S(y, 1). Then every singleton S = {x0} ⊆ S(y, 1) satisﬁes the condition from
Theorem 3, but bh1(S) = {x0} is not K.
∞ = (R2,k·k∞) with unit ball [−1, 1]2. Then all
Example 3. Consider the space l2
b-convex bodies are of the form [α1, β1] × [α2, β2] with 0 ≤ βi − αi ≤ 2, i = 1, 2.
We restrict our consideration to b-bounded b-convex bodies K with non-empty
interior. These are rectangles K = [α1, β1] × [α2, β2] with 0 < βi − αi < 2, i = 1, 2.
The exposed b-faces of K are the edges
F1 = [α1, β1]×{β2}, F2 = {α1}× [α2, β2], F3 = [α1, β1]×{α2}, F2 = {β1}× [α2, β2]

BALL CONVEX BODIES IN MINKOWSKI SPACES

19

and the unions F1 ∪ F2, F2 ∪ F3, F3 ∪ F4, F4 ∪ F1. Theorem 3 says that a set S ⊆ K
satisﬁes bh1(S) = K if and only if cl(S) ∩ Fj 6= ∅ for j = 1, 2, 3, 4. Consequently,
when searching for minimal sets S (under inclusion) with bh1(S) = K, we need to
ﬁnd a minimal set S containing at least one point from each of F1, F2, F3, F4. Such
S may consist of 2 (if S is composed of two vertices symmetric with respect to the
center of K), 3 or 4 points (if S contains exactly one point from the relative interior
of each Fi).

This example can be generalized for boxes in ln

∞, n ≥ 1. Corresponding minimal
sets must contain a point in every (classical) facet of a box and may consist of
2, . . . , 2n elements.

Corollary 4. If a subset S of a b-bounded b-convex body K in a Minkowski space
(Rn,k · k) satisﬁes bh1(S) = K, then b-exp(K) ⊆ cl(S).
Proof. If x ∈ b-exp(K), then {x} is an exposed b-face of K. Now Theorem 3 yields
{x} ∩ cl(S) 6= ∅; i.e., x ∈ cl(S).
Theorem 4. A subset S of a b-bounded b-convex body K in a strictly convex
Minkowski space (Rn,k · k) satisﬁes bh1(S) = K if and only if b-exp(K) ⊆ cl(S).
In particular,

(cid:3)

K = bh1(b-exp(K)) ,

and cl(b-exp(K)) is the unique minimal (under inclusion) closed subset of Rn whose
ball hull is K.

Proof. The implication “⇒” of “bh1(S) = K ⇔ b-exp(K) ⊆ cl(S)” is given by
Corollary 4. To see “⇐”, it is enough to show that
K ⊆ bh1(b-exp(K)).
(33)

Indeed, if b-exp(K) ⊆ cl(S) and if (33) is veriﬁed, then Lemma 1(b) and (a) give

K ⊆ bh1(b-exp(K)) ⊆ bh1(cl(S)) = bh1(S) ⊆ bh1(K) = K,

and “⇐” is proved.
Now, for showing (33), let us assume that there exists x0 ∈ K \ bh1(b-exp(K)).
The b-boundedness of K implies b-boundedness of the subset ˜K := bh1(b-exp(K)) ⊆
bh1(K) = K. Separation of x0 from ˜K by Proposition 1(c) and the b-boundedness
of K yield the existence of y0, y1 ∈ Rn and r ∈ (0, 1) such that

and

˜K ⊆ B(y0, r)

x0 /∈ B(y0, 1),

˜K ⊆ K ⊆ int(B(y1, r)).
Similarly as in the proof of Theorem 3, we deﬁne Br
λ ∈ [0, 1] and, exploiting K 6⊆ Br

Then there exists x1 ∈ K ∩ Sr

Br
λ0 ∩ S(y2, 1) = {x1},

x1 ∈ Br

λ0 ∩ S(y2, 1).

20

THOMAS JAHN, HORST MARTINI, AND CHRISTIAN RICHTER

Indeed, if x1 belonged to ˜K, we had kx1− y0k ≤ r and kx1− y1k < r. The inclusion
x1 ∈ Sr

λ0 = S(y0 + λ0(y1 − y0), r) gave

r = kx1 − (y0 + λ0(y1 − y0))k

= kλ0(x1 − y1) + (1 − λ0)(x1 − y0)k
≤ λ0kx1 − y1k + (1 − λ0)kx1 − y0k
< λ0r + (1 − λ0)r
= r.

This contradiction proves (37).

Since Br

λ0 is a b-convex body by Lemma 1(c) and since x1 ∈ Sr

λ0 = bd(Br

λ0 ),

because k · k is strictly convex. Using the known inclusions x1 ∈ K and K ⊆ Br
λ0 ,
we get

K ⊆ B(y2, 1)

and K ∩ S(y2, 1) = {x1}.

Hence x1 ∈ b-exp(K). But (37) says that x1 /∈ bh1(b-exp(K)). This ﬁnal contra-
diction establishes (33) and completes the proof.

(cid:3)

Theorem 4 says in particular that every b-bounded b-convex body in a strictly
convex Minkowski space gives rise to a unique minimal closed subset whose ball
hull is that body. We have seen in Example 3 that this is not necessarily the case
if the norm fails to be strictly convex.

Example 4. The set b-exp(K) of all b-exposed points of a b-bounded b-convex
body is not necessarily closed. An example of that kind in the Euclidean plane is
the convex disc K bounded by the arcs

2 cos(ϕ), 1

Thus, K is a b-bounded b-convex body with b-exp(K) = Γ3 ∪ Γ4. Exposed b-faces
that are no singletons are Γ1 and Γ2.

Corollary 5. If K is a b-bounded b-convex body in a strictly convex Minkowski
space (Rn,k · k), then every exposed b-face of K meets the closure of b-exp(K).
Proof. This is a consequence of Theorems 3 and 4.

(cid:3)

Corollary 6. If S is a non-empty b-bounded subset of a strictly convex Minkowski
space (Rn,k · k), then b-exp(bh1(S)) ⊆ cl(S).
Proof. By Lemma 1(d) and (a), K := bh1(S) is a b-bounded b-convex body and S
is a subset of K. Now Theorem 4 says that cl(S) ⊇ b-exp(K) = b-exp(bh1(S)). (cid:3)

BALL CONVEX BODIES IN MINKOWSKI SPACES

21

Example 3 gives b-bounded b-convex bodies not having any b-exposed points.
This shows that Theorem 4 and Corollary 5 fail in general if the underlying norm
is not strictly convex.

A similar reason justiﬁes the assumption of b-boundedness in Theorem 4 and

Corollary 5:
Proposition 3. If a b-convex body K in a Minkowski space (Rn,k · k) is not b-
bounded, then b-exp(K) = ∅.
Proof. We have rad(K) = 1, because K is not b-bounded. Hence every supporting
sphere S(x, 1) of K is the boundary of a circumball B(x, 1). By Lemma 2, |K ∩
S(x, 1)| ≥ 2. Hence none of the exposed b-faces of K is a singleton and K has no
b-exposed points.

(cid:3)

7. An application to diametrically maximal sets

A bounded non-empty set C ⊆ Rn is called complete (or diametrically maximal )
if diam(C∪{x}) > diam(C) for every x ∈ Rn\ C; see [38, 24, 18, 20]. Complete sets
are necessarily convex bodies, and in the Euclidean case or for n = 2 any complete
set is of constant width. A complete set C is called a completion of a bounded non-
empty set S if S ⊆ C and diam(C) = diam(S). Zorn’s lemma shows that every
bounded non-empty subset of Rn has at least one completion. In n-dimensional
Minkowski spaces (n ≥ 3), the family of complete bodies can form a much richer
class than that of bodies of constant width; see [40, 41] for recent contributions.
The following problem was posed in [31, Section 4]: Given a complete set C ⊆ Rn,
ﬁnd all convex bodies K0 ⊆ C such that C is the unique completion of K0 and,
moreover, there is no convex body K ⊆ K0, K 6= K0, such that C is the unique
completion of K.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that diam(C) = 1. The following
lemma summarizes particular relevant statements from the literature (for (a) and
(b), see [18, Section 1(E)]; for (c) and (d), see [20, Theorem 5] and the short proof
given there).
Lemma 5. The following are satisﬁed in every Minkowski space (Rn,k · k):

there exists x2 ∈ bd(C) such that kx1 − x2k = 1.

(a) A set C ⊆ Rn of diameter 1 is complete if and only if, for every x1 ∈ bd(C),
(b) A set C ⊆ Rn of diameter 1 is complete if and only if C =Tx∈C B(x, 1).
(c) A set S ⊆ Rn of diameter 1 has a unique completion if and only if bh1(S)
(d) If a set S ⊆ Rn of diameter 1 has a unique completion C, then C = bh1(S).

is complete.

Proposition 4. Let C be a complete set of diameter 1 in a Minkowski space (Rn,k·
k), and let K ⊆ C be a convex body. The following three conditions are equivalent:

(I) C is the unique completion of K.
(II) bh1(K) = C.
(III) K meets every exposed b-face of C.

If, in addition, k · k is strictly convex, then (I), (II), and (III) are equivalent to

(IV) cl(conv(b-exp(C))) ⊆ K.

22

THOMAS JAHN, HORST MARTINI, AND CHRISTIAN RICHTER

Proof. First note that C is b-bounded by (1), because diam(C) = 1, and Lemma 5(b)
shows that C is a b-bounded b-convex body.

Now Lemma 5(d) gives (I)⇒(II).

(I)⇒(II): Since C is a completion of K, we obtain diam(K) = diam(C) = 1.
(II)⇔(III) and (II)⇔(IV) follow from Theorems 3 and 4, respectively.
((II)∧(III))⇒(I): By (III), there exists x1 ∈ K ∩ bd(C). Lemma 5(a) gives
x′2 ∈ bd(C) such that x′2 ∈ S(x1, 1). Then S(x1, 1) is a supporting sphere of C
and F = C ∩ S(x1, 1) is an exposed b-face of C. By condition (III), there exists
x2 ∈ K ∩ F ⊆ K ∩ S(x1, 1). We obtain diam(K) = 1, because
1 = kx1 − x2k ≤ diam(K) ≤ diam(C) = 1.

Now Lemma 5(c) and (d) gives (II)⇒(I), and we are done.

(cid:3)

Criteria (III) and (IV) from Proposition 4 help to characterize minimal convex

bodies K0 in a complete set C such that C is the unique completion of K0.
Example 5. We consider the space ln
∞ as in Example 3. The only complete sets
in that space are closed balls (see [18, Corollary 2]), so that a complete set C of
diameter 1 is necessarily a box (i.e., a square if n = 2) with edges of length 1 parallel
to the coordinate axes. The equivalence of (I) and (III) in Proposition 4 says that
C is the unique completion of a convex body K ⊆ C if and only if K meets each of
the 2n facets of C. It is easy to ﬁnd minimal convex bodies K0 with that property:
Such K0 is the convex hull of a minimal set S consisting of at least one point from
each facet of C. If n = 2, then such K0 can be a line segment (a diagonal of C),
a triangle or a quadrangle. For arbitrary n ≥ 2, the number of vertices of such K0
can be 2 (if K0 is a diagonal of C passing through the center of C), 3, . . . , 2n (e.g.,
if K0 is the cross polytope generated by the centers of the 2n facets of C).

If the underlying Minkowski space is strictly convex, then Proposition 4 shows

that the problem mentioned above has a unique solution.

Corollary 7. Let C be a complete set of diameter 1 in a strictly convex Minkowski
space (Rn,k · k). Then K0 = cl(conv(b-exp(C))) is the unique minimal (under
inclusion) convex body whose unique completion is C.

8. Open questions

8.1. Spindle convexity in Minkowski spaces. In [27] bh1({x1, x2}) is called the
spindle of x1, x2 ∈ Rn, which generalizes the corresponding notion from Euclidean
space (see, e.g., [10] and the references given there). A set S ⊆ Rn is called spindle
convex if, for all x1, x2 ∈ S, S covers the whole spindle of x1 and x2. This gives
rise to the concept of the spindle convex hull of a subset of Rn. Note that spindle
convex sets are not necessarily closed, in contrast to b-convex sets. Closed sets turn
out to be spindle convex if and only if they are b-convex, provided the underlying
Minkowski space is Euclidean or two-dimensional or its unit ball is (an aﬃne image
of) a cube (see [10, Corollary 3.4], [27, Corollaries 3.13 and 3.15]). An example in
(an aﬃne image of) the space l3
1 from Example 1 shows that closed spindle convex
sets need not be b-convex in general (see [27, Example 3.1]).

We deﬁne a related hierarchy of notions of convexity by calling a set S ⊆ Rn
k-spindle convex, k ∈ {2, 3, . . .}, if bh1({x1, . . . , xk}) ⊆ S for all x1, . . . , xk ∈ S. We
call S ∗-spindle convex if bh1(F ) ⊆ S for every ﬁnite F ⊆ S (i.e., if S is k-spindle
convex for all k = 2, 3, . . .).

BALL CONVEX BODIES IN MINKOWSKI SPACES

23

Are the k-spindle convex hulls and the ∗-spindle convex hull of a closed set
closed? Clearly, every b-convex set is ∗-spindle convex. Is every closed ∗-spindle
convex set b-convex? Theorem 2 says that in many situations bh1(S) is the closure
of the ∗-spindle convex hull of S. On the other hand, the relatively open segment S
from Example 2 is ∗-spindle convex, but cl(S) is not even 2-spindle convex. Given
an arbitrary Minkowski space (Rn,k · k), does there exist k ∈ {2, 3, . . .} such that
∗-spindle convexity coincides with k-spindle convexity? Given k ∈ {2, 3, . . .}, does
there exist a Minkowski space (Rn,k · k) such that k-spindle convexity diﬀers from
(k +1)-spindle convexity? These and related questions might be studied to continue
naturally our investigations here.

8.2. Generalized Minkowski spaces. Our results are shown in the framework
of a Minkowski space. What remains true if the norm is replaced by a gauge, i.e.,
if the unit ball is no longer necessarily centered at o?

8.3. M¨obius geometry. One might check whether there are interesting connec-
tions (e.g., regarding the used methods and tools) to M¨obius geometry where
spheres also play somehow the role of hyperplanes; see, e.g., [52, 26].
