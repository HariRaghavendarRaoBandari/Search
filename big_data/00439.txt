ABSTRACT

Context. Ionized regions around early-type stars are believed to be well-known objects, but until recently, our knowledge of the
relation between the free-free radio emission and the IR emission has been observationally hindered by the limited angular resolution
in the far-IR. The advent of Herschel has now made it possible to obtain a more precise comparison between the two regimes, and
it has been found that about a third of the young Hii regions emit more Lyman continuum photons than expected, thus presenting a
Lyman excess.
Aims. With the present study we wish to distinguish between two scenarios that have been proposed to explain the existence of the
Lyman excess: (i) underestimation of the bolometric luminosity, or (ii) additional emission of Lyman-continuum photons from an
accretion shock.
Methods.We observed an outﬂow (SiO) and an infall (HCO+) tracer toward a complete sample of 200 Hii regions, 67 of which present
the Lyman excess. Our goal was to search for any systematic diﬀerence between sources with Lyman excess and those without.
Results. While the outﬂow tracer does not reveal any signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two subsamples of Hii regions, the infall
tracer indicates that the Lyman-excess sources are more associated with infall signposts than the other objects.
Conclusions. Our ﬁndings indicate that the most plausible explanation for the Lyman excess is that in addition to the Lyman con-
tinuum emission from the early-type star, UV photons are emitted from accretion shocks in the stellar neighborhood. This result
suggests that high-mass stars and/or stellar clusters containing young massive stars may continue to accrete for a long time, even after
the development of a compact Hii region.

1. Introduction

Early-type stars are well-known emitters of copious amounts of
ultraviolet photons shortward of 912 Å, which are suﬃciently
energetic to ionize atomic hydrogen. The neutral gas surround-
ing such stars during their earliest stages is thus ionized by the
Lyman-continuum photons, and an Hii region is created. In the
ideal case of an optically thin Hii region around a single OB-
type star, it is easy to obtain the stellar Lyman-continuum pho-
ton rate (NLy) – as well as other relevant parameters of the star
– from the radio continuum ﬂux density emitted by the ion-
ized gas (see, e.g., Schraml & Mezger 1969). In turn, from NLy
we can estimate the stellar luminosity (see, e.g., Panagia 1973;
Martins et al. 2005). The latter can be measured by other means
from the IR emission of the dusty envelope enshrouding the star
and then compared to the value obtained from the Lyman contin-
uum. While the two luminosity estimates should match, in prac-
tice the one obtained from the IR emission is often signiﬁcantly
greater than that computed from the radio ﬂux. This discrepancy
was discussed by Wood & Churchwell (1989), and a number of
explanations were proposed (opacity of the free-free emission,
stellar multiplicity, insuﬃcient angular resolution in the IR). The
most important of these was probably the enormous diﬀerence in
resolving power between IR and radio observations. In fact, the
bolometric luminosity (Lbol) estimate was based on the IRAS
data, whose instrumental beam in the far-IR is >1′much greater

than the typical size of a compact (i.e., young) Hii region (<10′′;
see, e.g., Wood & Churchwell 1989) imaged with a radio inter-
ferometer. Consequently, the IRAS ﬂuxes are measured over a
solid angle encompassing not only the Hii region, but also other
(unrelated) stars, and the value of Lbol is overestimated.

With the advent of the ESA Herschel Space Observatory
(Pilbratt et al. 2010), it was possible to dramatically improve on
the Lbol estimate and thus achieve a more reliable comparison
with the luminosity obtained from the Lyman continuum. In a
recent study, Cesaroni et al. (2015) (hereafter C2015) have com-
pared NLy to Lbol for the sample of compact and ultracompact
Hii regions identiﬁed by Purcell et al. (2013) in the CORNISH
survey (Hoare et al. 2012). The value of Lbol has been estimated
for 200 objects by reconstructing the corresponding spectral en-
ergy distributions using the far-IR images of the Herschel/Hi-
GAL survey of the Galactic plane (Molinari et al. 2010) and an-
cillary data from 1 mm to the mid-IR. As discussed by C2015
(see their Sect. 4.1), the surprising result is that about one-third
of the Hii regions appear to have NLy greater than expected
on the basis of their luminosities (see Fig. 1). After taking a
number of possible explanations into account, C2015 (see also
Sánchez-Monge et al. 2013) demonstrated that this so-called Ly-
man excess cannot be easily justiﬁed. Basically, two scenarios
are possible.

Fig. 1. Plot of the Lyman-continuum photon rate versus the corre-
sponding bolometric luminosity for the 200 CORNISH Hii regions with
Herschel/Hi-GAL counterparts studied by C2015. The spectral types
indicated at the top are computed under the assumption that Lbol origi-
nates from a single ZAMS star. The red solid line denotes the NLy–Lbol
relation expected if the Hii regions were powered by single ZAMS stars
(see C2015). Note that 67 objects (∼34% of the sample) lie above this
line. The error bars in the bottom right corner correspond to a 20% cal-
ibration uncertainty.

spherical symmetry adopted in the Lbol calculation leads to an
underestimate.

The second scenario assumes that the Lyman excess is due
to additional emission of UV photons from the stellar neighbor-
hood. The models adopted to estimate NLy for zero-age main-
sequence (ZAMS) stars refer to visible objects, whose proper-
ties might be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those of a very young
deeply embedded OB-type star, perhaps still undergoing accre-
tion from the parental cloud. Recent theoretical studies of this
type of objects predict signiﬁcant Lyman-continuum emission
from accretion shocks (Smith 2014; Hosokawa & Omukai 2009;
Hosokawa pers. comm.), which may justify an excess of up to
two orders of magnitude above the expected value of NLy (see
Figs. 15 and 16 of Smith 2014).

If the ﬁrst scenario is correct, molecular outﬂows should be
more common in Lyman-excess sources than in the rest of the
sample. In contrast, the second hypothesis implies that accre-
tion should be preferentially present in the Lyman excess sam-
ple. With this in mind, we decided to search for outﬂow and
infall tracers in the whole sample of 200 Hii regions studied by
C2015 and thus compare the occurrence of these two phenom-
ena in sources with and without Lyman excess. For this purpose,
we observed the HCO+(1–0) and SiO(2–1) lines. The former ap-
pears to present redshifted self-absorption when the gas is in-
falling, while the latter is a well-known tracer of shocked gas
in molecular jets and outﬂows (see, e.g., López-Sepulcre et al.
2010, 2011, and references therein).

2. Observations and data analysis

The observations were performed with the IRAM 30 m telescope
on Pico Veleta, using the EMIR receivers (Carter et al. 2012)
with the fast Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) at 200 kHz
resolution (Klein et al. 2012). By combining two bands of the

EMIR receiver, we covered a bandwidth of 16 GHz in dual po-
larization. While a plethora of potentially useful lines was ob-
served with our setup, in this study we focus on the HCO+(1–0),
H13CO+(1–0), and SiO(2–1) rotational transitions. The observa-
tions were performed in December 2014 and May and August
2015 using the position-switch mode, where the reference posi-
tion was chosen from the Herschel/Hi-GAL maps as the closest
to the target with minimal continuum emission at 350 µm. In this
way, we maximized the likelihood that molecular line emission
is also very faint. The on-source integration time per target was
4 min, although for a limited number of faint emitters the inte-
gration was repeated twice. We pointed on strong nearby quasars
every ∼1.5 hr. Pointing corrections were stable, with errors be-
low 3". Typical system temperatures ranged from 105 K to 200 K
at 3 mm and from 120 K to 400 K at 2 mm. The instrumental
half-power beam width was ∼27′′.
The data reduction and analysis were made with the program
CLASS of the GILDAS package1. For each line all relevant spec-
tra were averaged and a ﬁrst-order polynomial baseline was sub-
tracted. Then a Gaussian proﬁle was ﬁt to the H13CO+(1–0) and
SiO(2–1) lines. The HCO+(1–0) line is often asymmetric, hence
the ﬁt took only the channels around the peak into account and
ignored those where the asymmetry was most evident. In this
way, we could obtain a reliable estimate of the peak velocity,
which is the only useful parameter for our purposes.

3. Results

We obtained data for all of the 200 targets, 67 of which present
Lyman excess. The detection rates for the diﬀerent lines are
summarized in Table 1. The HCO+(1–0) line was detected in
all sources, whereas the H13CO+(1–0) and SiO(2–1) transitions
were detected in 192 and 99 targets, respectively. In the follow-
ing we look for possible evidence in favor of either explanation
of the Lyman excess phenomenon: ﬂashlight eﬀect due to a bipo-
lar outﬂow, or accretion shock associated with infall.

3.1. Outﬂow

If the ﬂashlight eﬀect is at work in the Lyman-excess sources,
the number of outﬂows in these objects should outnumber those
detected in the remaining targets. Since, as previously men-
tioned, SiO is an excellent tracer of shocks in jets and out-
ﬂows, we would expect the SiO line to be found preferentially
in the Lyman-excess sample. However, this is not the case, as

only 18 targets out of 67 have been detected among the Lyman-
excess sources (see Table 1). The corresponding detection rate
is 27±5%, signiﬁcantly lower than for the other Hii regions
(61±4%). This diﬀerence might be a luminosity eﬀect. The
Lyman-excess Hii regions are on average less luminous than the
other sources (the former span the Lbol range 103–1.7 × 105 L
,
⊙
the latter 104–1.3×106 L
– see Fig. 1) and it may reasonably be
⊙
expected that more intense SiO emission is associated with more
luminous objects. There is no evidence that the SiO emission is
preferentially associated with the Lyman-excess sources.

Broad wings are indicative of outﬂow motions, and it is thus
worth inspecting the full width at zero intensity (FWZI) of the
SiO(2–1) line. In general, the FWZI is measured at the 3 σ level,
but this deﬁnition aﬀects the comparison between sources with
diﬀerent signal-to-noise ratios. Therefore, we prefer to deﬁne the
FWZI as the line width at a ﬁxed fraction of the peak intensity,
which we arbitrarily chose to be 25%. Our choice is dictated by
a trade-oﬀ between selecting the lowest possible level of inten-
sity (to be more sensitive to the presence of wings) and keeping
this level above the sensitivity limit. To optimize the signal-to-
noise ratio, we smoothed the spectra to a resolution of 2.7 km s−1
before determining the FWZI, which made it possible to derive
the FWZI for 70 sources out of 99 detected in SiO. No signif-
icant diﬀerence is found between the FWZI distributions of the
sources with Lyman excess and those without, as indicated by
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which gives a probability of 91%
that the two distributions are equivalent.

While an analysis of the FWZI is useful to investigate possi-
ble diﬀerences between the two samples, it is not ideal to estab-
lish the presence of line wings. For this purpose we developed a
diﬀerent method that we describe below. For a perfectly Gaus-
sian proﬁle, the ratio between the FWZI (deﬁned as above) and
the full width at half maximum (FWHM) is ﬁxed and equal to

√ln 25/ ln 2 ≃ 1.41. If, instead, broad wings are present, the ratio

FWZI/FWHM must be signiﬁcantly greater. In an attempt to de-
termine the presence of line wings in our sources in an objective
way, we computed FWZI/FWHM for the SiO(2–1) line. We note
that we were unable to use the HCO+(1–0) line, which has also

been detected in outﬂows (e.g., López-Sepulcre et al. 2010), be-
cause the line shape is often asymmetric and makes it impossible
to obtain a reliable measurement of the FWHM.

Figure 2 shows the distributions of the ratio FWZI/FWHM
for sources with and without Lyman excess. Although some evi-
dence of non-Gaussian proﬁles is seen (i.e., several sources with
FWZI/FWHM>1.41, suggesting the presence of outﬂows), the
important point is that no remarkable diﬀerence is found be-
tween the two distributions, as conﬁrmed by the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov statistical test, which gives a relatively high probability
(28%) that the two samples have the same intrinsic distribution.
It is also worth noting that sources with prominent wings (e.g.,
with FWZI/FWHM>2), correspond to 28±12% of the Lyman-
excess sample and 34±6% of the other sample: these percentages
are comparable, within the uncertainties, and therefore support
the similarity between the two types of objects.

In conclusion, molecular outﬂows do not appear to be pref-
erentially associated with Lyman-excess sources, and neither the
ﬂashlight eﬀect, nor any other outﬂow-related phenomenon can
therefore be a viable explanation.

3.2. Infall

To determine the presence of infall, we adopted the approach of
Mardones et al. (1997). Their method is based on the fact that an
optically thick line of a molecule tracing infall, such as HCO+,
has an asymmetric proﬁle caused by redshifted self-absorption.
In contrast, a line of the isotopolog, H13CO+, being optically
thin, has a Gaussian proﬁle. Therefore, by comparing the peak
velocities of the two isotopologs, it is possible to reveal the pres-
ence of infall. In practice, Mardones et al. (1997) deﬁned the pa-
rameter

δV = (Vthick − Vthin)/∆Vthin,
where Vthick is the peak velocity of the HCO+(1–0) line and Vthin
and ∆Vthin are, respectively, the peak velocity and FWHM of the
H13CO+(1–0) line. Infall and expansion correspond to δV<0 and
δV>0, respectively.

We computed δV for 171 of our sources, 56 of these with
Lyman excess. The remaining 29 objects were not detected in
the H13CO+ line or presented complex spectra made of multiple
components and/or were aﬀected by deep absorption features.
The distributions of δV for the two samples are shown in Fig. 3.
The step of the histograms has been taken equal to the mean 6σ
uncertainty on the δV parameter. The distribution of the Lyman-
excess sources is skewed toward negative values of δV, whereas
the other appears centered on δV=0. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test gives a probability of only 3% that the two distributions are
equivalent.

To further support that the Lyman-excess sample is domi-
nated by infalling sources, we again followed Mardones et al.
(1997), who deﬁned the parameter
E = (Ninfall − Nexpansion)/Ntotal,
(2)
where Ninfall is the number of sources with δV < −3 σ (1 σ RMS
in δV is ∼0.05), Nexpansion those with δV > +3 σ, and Ntotal=171
the number of all sources. Positive values of E denote samples
characterized by infalling objects, while negative values are as-
sociated with outﬂows. For the Lyman-excess sources we ﬁnd
E = 0.32 ± 0.09, whereas the other sample has E = 0.10 ± 0.06,
consistent with the Lyman-excess sources being signiﬁcantly
more associated with infall than the others. In Table 1 we pro-
vide a summary of the information on the presence of infall in
our sources.

Based on the above, we conclude that our ﬁndings are consis-
tent with the accretion scenario proposed to explain the Lyman
excess. Here a caveat is in order. Our HCO+ measurements are
sensitive to large-scale (<∼1 pc) infall and not to accretion onto
the star or a putative circumstellar disk. The presence of infall is
thus not direct evidence of the existence of accretion. However,
we believe it plausible that at least part of the infalling material
is bound to become focused on a very small region and there
dissipate its energy in shocks.

4. Discussion and conclusions

The existence of Lyman excess in young early-type stars may
have important consequences not only on the structure and evo-
lution of Hii regions, but also on our understanding of the high-
mass star formation process itself. All theories appear to agree
that even the most massive stars may form through accretion, de-
spite the diﬀerent mechanisms invoked by the diﬀerent models,
such as competitive accretion (Bonnell & Bate 2006) and mono-
lithic collapse (Krumholz et al. 2009). However, it is still unclear
whether the star reaches the ZAMS at approximately its ﬁnal
mass, or if still grows after igniting hydrogen burning.

Assuming that each of the Hii region is associated with a
single massive star, our ﬁndings appear to support the latter sce-
nario, where accretion may continue through the ionized region
enshrouding the star, consistent with the model by Keto (2003,
2007). We can also conclude that the material accreted in this
phase is a non-negligible fraction of the ﬁnal stellar mass. If one-
third of the ultracompact Hii regions are in the accretion phase,
this means that accretion continues during one-third of the ul-
tracompact Hii region lifetime (∼105 yr; Wood & Churchwell
1989), namely ∼ 3 × 104 yr. At an accretion rate of 10−4–
10−3 M
yr−1, typical of massive young stellar objects (see, e.g.,
⊙
Fazal et al. 2008 and references therein), this corresponds to a to-
tal accreted mass of 3–30 M
, a signiﬁcant fraction of the mass
⊙
of an early-type star. All the above indirectly suggests that the
accretion ﬂow signiﬁcantly deviates from spherical symmetry.

High accretion rates should quench the formation of an Hii re-
gion (Yorke 1984; Walmsley 1995; Keto 2002), but if accretion
is focused through a circumstellar disk, for instance, the Lyman-
continuum photons may escape along the disk axis and hence
ionize the surrounding gas. This could explain the co-existence
of accretion onto the star and formation of a compact Hii region
in the same object.

The scenario depicted above assumes that our Hii regions are
ionized by single stars. However, massive stars form in clusters
(e.g., Tan et al. 2014), and it is likely that multiple stars con-
tribute to the ionization. Therefore, an alternative scenario is that
the infalling material does not end up on the ionizing, ZAMS
star, but on one or more stellar companions still in the main ac-
cretion phase. In this case, our ﬁndings would imply that the
high-mass star formation process in the cluster does not come
to an end once the most massive star has reached the ZAMS,
but instead continues even after the formation of an Hii region.
Whether splitting the accreting material among two or more
stars will be eﬃcient enough to produce the required excess of
Lyman-continuum photons is a non-trivial question that requires
a dedicated model to be answered.

While all the previous considerations are at present purely
speculative, direct detection of the accretion ﬂow both in the
molecular gas and in the ionized gas in the stellar surroundings
are needed to establish the origin of the Lyman excess on solid
grounds and to decide whether accretion is focused onto a single
star or distributed among multiple stellar companions. To shed
light on these questions, observations with the Atacama Large
Millimeter and submillimeter Array (ALMA) are in progress for
a selected subsample of our targets.
