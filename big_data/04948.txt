Some remarks on sets with small quotient set ∗

Shkredov I.D.

Annotation.

We prove, in particular, that for any ﬁnite set A ⊂ R with |A/A| ≪ |A| one has |A−A| ≫ |A|5/3−o(1).

Also we show that |3A| ≫ |A|2−o(1) in the case.

Introduction

Let A, B ⊂ R be ﬁnite sets. Deﬁne the sum set, the product set and the quotient set of A and
B as

and

A + B := {a + b : a ∈ A, b ∈ B} ,

AB := {ab : a ∈ A, b ∈ B} ,

A/B := {a/b : a ∈ A, b ∈ B, b 6= 0} ,

correspondingly. Sometimes we write kA for multiple sumsets, diﬀerence and so on, e.g. A + A +
A = 3A. The Erd¨os–Szemer´edi conjecture [5] says that for any ǫ > 0 one has

max {|A + A|, |AA|} ≫ |A|2−ǫ .

(1)

Modern bounds concerning the conjecture can be found in [20], [9], [10]. The ﬁrst interesting
case of Conjecture (1) was proved in [4], see also [20], namely

|A + A| ≪ |A|

or

|A − A| ≪ |A| =⇒ |AA| ≫ |A|2−ǫ

or

|A/A| ≫ |A|2−ǫ .

The opposite situation is wide open and it is called sometimes a weak Erd¨os–Szemer´edi Conjec-
ture [13]. So, it is unknown

|AA| ≪ |A|

or

|A/A| ≪ |A| =⇒ |A + A| ≫ |A|2−ǫ

or

|A − A| ≫ |A|2−ǫ ?

(2)

The best current lower bounds on the size of sumsets of sets A with small AA or A/A are
contained in [9], [10]. As for diﬀerence sets it was proved in [19], [7] that

|AA| ≪ |A|

or

|A/A| ≪ |A| =⇒ |A − A| ≫ |A|14/11−ǫ .

The integer situation was considered in [2] (in the paper M.–C. Chang has deal with the case of
multiple sumsets as well).

Let us formulate the ﬁrst main result of our paper (see Theorem 10 below).

Theorem 1 Let A ⊂ R be a ﬁnite set. Then

|A/A| ≪ |A| =⇒ |A − A| ≫ |A|5/3−ǫ .

bound for Sn

Our method uses some ideas from the higher energies, see [14] and has some intersections
with [19]. The main new ingredient is the following observation. Let us suppose that there
is a family of ﬁnite (multidimensional) sets Aj, j = 1, . . . , n and we want to obtain a lower
j=1 Aj. Let us assume the contrary and the ﬁrst simple model situation is A1 =
· · · = An, so we need to separate from the case at least. Suppose that for any j there is a
map (projection) πj associated with each set Aj. We should think about the maps πj as about
”diﬀerent” maps somehow (in particular they cannot coincide). More precisely, if one is able
j=1 πi(Aj) is strictly bigger than maxj |πi(Aj)| then it cannot be the case A1 =
j=1 Aj should be large. For more precise formulation see the proof of

to prove that Sn
· · · = An and hence Sn

Theorem 10.

Our second main result shows that Conjecture (2) holds if one consider A + A + A or

A + A − A, see Theorem 12 below.

Theorem 2 Let A ⊂ R be a ﬁnite set, and |AA| ≪ |A| or |A/A| ≪ |A|. Then for any α, β 6= 0
one has

|A + αA + βA| ≫

.

|A|2

log3 |A|

Theorem 2 is an analog of main Theorem 1 from [17] and it is proved by a similar method.

Also we study diﬀerent properties of sets with small product/quotient set, see section 5.

The best results for multiple sumsets kA, k → ∞ of sets A with small product/quotient set

can be found in [1], see also our remarks in section 5.

The author is grateful to S.V. Konyagin for useful discussions.

2 Notation

Let G be an abelian group. In this paper we use the same letter to denote a set S ⊆ G and its
characteristic function S : G → {0, 1}. By |S| denote the cardinality of S.

Let f, g : G → C be two functions. Put

(f ∗ g)(x) := Xy∈G

f (y)g(x − y)

and

(f ◦ g)(x) := Xy∈G

f (y)g(y + x) .

(3)

By E+(A, B) denote the additive energy of two sets A, B ⊆ G (see e.g. [22]), that is

E+(A, B) = |{a1 + b1 = a2 + b2 : a1, a2 ∈ A, b1, b2 ∈ B}| .

I. D. Shkredov

3

If A = B we simply write E+(A) instead of E+(A, A). Clearly,

E+(A, B) =Xx

(A ∗ B)(x)2 =Xx

(A ◦ B)(x)2 =Xx

(A ◦ A)(x)(B ◦ B)(x) .

Note also that

E+(A, B) ≤ min{|A|2|B|, |B|2|A|, |A|3/2|B|3/2} .

(4)

More generally (see [14]), for k ≥ 2 put

k (A) = |{a1 − a′
E+

1 = a2 − a′

2 = · · · = ak − a′

k : ai, a′

i ∈ A}| .

Thus, E+(A) = E+

2 (A).

In the same way deﬁne the multiplicative energy of two sets A, B ⊆ G

E×(A, B) = |{a1b1 = a2b2 : a1, a2 ∈ A, b1, b2 ∈ B}|

and, similarly, E×
of multiplicative convolutions, as in (3). We often use the notation

k (A). Certainly, the multiplicative energy E×(A, B) can be expressed in terms

for any λ ∈ A/A. Hence

Aλ = A×

λ = A ∩ (λ−1A)

E×(A) = Xλ∈A/A

|Aλ|2 .

For given integer k ≥ 2, a ﬁxed vector ~λ = (λ1, . . . , λk−1) and a set A put

∆~λ(A) = {(λ1a, λ2a, . . . , λk−1a, a) : a ∈ A} ⊆ Ak .

All logarithms are base 2. Signs ≪ and ≫ are the usual Vinogradov’s symbols. Having a
set A, we write a . b or b & a if a = O(b · logc |A|), c > 0. For any given prime p denote by Fp
the ﬁnite prime ﬁeld and put F∗

p = Fp \ {0}.

3 Preliminaries

Again, let G = (G, +) be an abelian group with the group operation +. We begin with the
famous Pl¨unnecke–Ruzsa inequality (see [22], e.g.).

Lemma 3 Let A, B ⊆ G be two ﬁnite sets, |A + B| ≤ K|A|. Then for all positive integers n, m
the following holds

|nB − mB| ≤ K n+m|A| .

(5)

Further, for any 0 < δ < 1 there is X ⊆ A such that |X| ≥ (1 − δ)|A| and for any integer k one
has

|X + kB| ≤ (K/δ)k|X| .

(6)

4

The next lemma is a small generalization of Exercise 1.1.8 from [22] and can be obtained

using the probabilistic method, say.

Lemma 4 Let A, B ⊆ G be two ﬁnite sets. Then there exists a set X ⊆ A + B − B,

|X| ≪

|A + B − B|

|B|

· log |A + B|

such that A + B ⊆ X + B.

The method of the paper relies on the famous Szemer´edi–Trotter Theorem [21], see also

[22]. Let us recall the deﬁnitions.

We call a set L of continuous plane curves a pseudo-line system if any two members of L
share at most one point in common. Deﬁne the number of indices I(P, L) between points and
pseudo–lines as I(P, L) = |{(p, l) ∈ P × L : p ∈ l}|.

Theorem 5 Let P be a set of points and let L be a pseudo-line system. Then

I(P, L) ≪ |P|2/3|L|2/3 + |P| + |L| .

A simple consequence of Theorem 5 was obtained in [16], see Lemma 7.

Lemma 6 Let A ⊂ R be a ﬁnite set. Put M (A) equals

Then

M (A) := min
B6=∅

|AB|2
|A||B|

.

E+
3 (A) ≪ M (A)|A|3 log |A| .

(7)

(8)

Also we need in a result from [11]. Let T(A) be the number of collinear triples in A × A.

Theorem 7 Let A ⊂ R be a ﬁnite set. Then

T(A) ≪ |A|4 log |A| .

More generally, for three ﬁnite sets A, B, C ⊂ R put T(A, B, C) be the number of collinear
triples in A × A, B × B, C × C, correspondingly. Clearly, the quantity T(A, B, C) is symmetric
on all its variables. Further, it is easy to see that

T(A, B, C) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

and

(cid:26) c1 − a1

b1 − a1

=

c2 − a2

T(A, B, B) = Xa1,a2∈A

Corollary 8 Let A, B ⊂ R be two ﬁnite sets, |B| ≤ |A|. Then

T(A, B, B) ≪ |A|2|B|2 log |B| ,

and for any ﬁnite A1, A2 ⊂ R, |B| ≤ |A1|, |A2| one has

T(A1, A2, B) ≪ |A1|2|A2|2 log |B| .

P r o o f. Split A onto t ≪ |A|/|B| parts Bj of size at most |B|. Then, using Theorem 7, we get

T(A, B, B) ≤

t

Xi,j=1

T(Bi × Bj, B, B) ≪ t2|B|4 log |B| ≪ |A|2|B|2 log |B|

as required. The second bound follows similarly. This completes the proof.

✷

We need in a result from [12], which is a consequence of the main theorem from [13].

Theorem 9 Let A, B, C ⊆ Fp, and let M = max(|A|, |BC|). Suppose that |A||B||BC| ≪ p2.
Then

E+(A, C) ≪ (|A||BC|)3/2|B|−1/2 + M |A||BC||B|−1 .

(10)

4 The proof of the main result

Now let us obtain a lower bound for the diﬀerence set of sets with small quotient set.

Theorem 10 Let A ⊂ R be a ﬁnite set. Then

|A − A|6|A/A|13 & |A|23 .

(11)

In particular, if |A/A| ≪ |A| then |A − A| & |A|5/3.

P r o o f. Let Π = A/A. Put M equals |Π|/|A|. Without loosing of generality one can suppose
that 0 /∈ A. Let D = A − A. Let also P = D × D. Then for any λ ∈ Π one has

Qλ := A × Aλ − ∆λ(Aλ) ⊆ P .

Further, for an arbitrary λ ∈ Π consider a projection πλ(x, y) = x − λy. Then, it is easy to
check that πλ(Qλ) ⊆ D. In other words, if we denote by Lλ the set of all lines of the form
{(x, y) : x − λy = c}, intersecting the set Qλ, we obtain that |Lλ| ≤ |D|. Finally, take any set

(12)

Λ ⊆ Π, Λ = Λ−1, and put L =Fλ∈Λ Lλ. It follows that

|Lλ| ≤ |D||Λ| .

|L| = Xλ∈Λ

6

By the construction the number of indices I(P, L) between points P and lines L is at least

I(P, L) ≥Pλ∈Λ |Qλ|. Applying Szemer´edi–Trotter Theorem 5, using formula (12), and making

simple calculations, we get

|Qλ| ≤ I(P, L) ≪ (|L||P|)2/3 + |L| + |P| ≪ |D|2|Λ|2/3 .

(13)

Xλ∈Λ

Hence, our task is to ﬁnd a good lower bound for the sum Pλ∈Λ |Qλ|. For any λ ∈ Π, we have

Aλ(z)A(λz + x)Aλ(z + y) ,

|A||Aλ|2 =Xx,y Xz

Aλ(z)A(λz + x)Aλ(z + y) = X(x,y)∈QλXz

and, thus, by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, we get

|A||Aλ|2 ≤ |Qλ|1/2 ·

Xx,y  Xz

Aλ(z)A(λz + x)Aλ(z + y)!2


1/2

.

Summing over λ ∈ Λ and applying the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality once more time, we obtain

|A|2(E×

Λ (A))2 := |A|2 Xλ∈Λ

|Aλ|2!2
|Qλ| ·Xλ∈ΛXw

Aλ(z)A(λz + x)Aλ(z + y)!2

=

≤ Xλ∈Λ

(Aλ ◦ Aλ)2(w)(A ◦ A)(λw) = σ1 · σ2 .

(14)

Let us estimate the sum σ2. Putting ˜Aλ = A ∩ λA, we see that by the H¨older inequality the
following holds

σ2 = Xλ∈ΛXw

(Aλ ◦ Aλ)2(w/λ)(A ◦ A)(w) = Xλ∈ΛXw

( ˜Aλ ◦ ˜Aλ)2(w)(A ◦ A)(w) ≤

Put Λ ⊆ Π, Λ = Λ−1 such that

(E+

3 ( ˜Aλ))2/3 .

|A|3
M

≤ E×(A) . EΛ(A) .

(15)

The ﬁrst bound in (15) is just the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality (4) and the existence of the set
Λ follows from the simple pigeonholing. In particular, it follows that | ˜Aλ| = |Aλ| ≫ |A|/M and
hence |Λ| ≪ M |A|. Because of |A/A| ≤ M |A|, we clearly have M (A) ≤ M 2. Applying Lemma 6
and the notation from (7) for the set A as well for the sets ˜Aλ, we get

σ2 . M 2/3|A| ·Xλ∈Λ

M 2/3( ˜Aλ)| ˜Aλ|2 .

I. D. Shkredov

It is easy to see that

M ( ˜Aλ) ≤

|A ˜Aλ|2

M 2|A|

(16)

and hence

σ2 . M 8/3|A| · E×

Λ (A) .

Here we have used the fact Λ = Λ−1. Returning to (15) and using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality,
we get

Combining the last bound with (13), we obtain

|Qλ| &

|A|4
M 11/3

.

Xλ∈Λ

|A|12
M 11 . |D|6|Λ|2 ≤ M 2|A|2|D|6

as required.

✷

Remark 11 Careful analysis of the proof (e.g. one should use the estimate M ( ˜Aλ) ≤ M 2|A|/| ˜Aλ|
from (16)) shows that we have obtained an upper bound for the higher energy E×

8 (A). Namely,

|A|7E×

8 (A) . |A/A|6|A − A|6 .

The last bound is always better than Elekes’ inequality for quotient sets [3]

|A|5 ≪ |A/A|2|A ± A|2 .

Now let us prove our second main result, which corresponds to the main theorem from [17].

Theorem 12 Let A ⊂ R be a ﬁnite set, and |AA| ≤ M |A| or |A/A| ≤ M |A|. Then for any
α 6= 0 one has

In particular,

E×(A + α) ≪ M 4|A|2 log |A| .

|AA + A + A| ≥ |(A + 1)(A + 1)| ≫

|A|2

M 4 log |A|

.

Finally, for any α, β 6= 0 the following holds

|A + αA + βA| ≫

|A|2

M 10 log3 |A|

.

(17)

(18)

(19)

8

P r o o f. Without loosing of generality one can suppose that 0 /∈ A. Let Π = AA, Q = A/A.
Applying the second estimate of Corollary 8 with B = −αA, A1 = A2 = Π as well as formula
(9), we get

E×(Π + αa, Π + αa′) ≪ M 4|A|4 log |A| .

Xa,a′∈A

Thus there are a, a′ ∈ A such that E×(Π + αa, Π + αa′) ≪ M 4|A|2 log |A|. In other words,

E×(Π/a + α, Π/a′ + α) = E×(Π + αa, Π + αa′) ≪ M 4|A|2 log |A| .

Clearly, A ⊆ Π/a, A ⊆ Π/a′ and hence E×(A + α) ≪ M 4|A|2 log |A|. To obtain the same
estimate with Q just note that for any a ∈ A one has A ⊆ Qa and apply the same arguments
with B = −αA−1. Further, by estimate (17) with α = 1 and bound (4), we have

|AA + A + A| = |AA + A + A + 1| ≥ |(A + 1)(A + 1)| ≫

|A|2

M 4 log |A|

and (18) follows.

It remains to prove (19). Using Lemma 4 in its multiplicative form with A = A, B = A−1,
· log |A| such that Q ⊆ XA. By Lemma 3, we get

we ﬁnd a set X = {x1, . . . , xt}, t ≪ |AA/A|
t ≪ M 3 log |A|. Further

|A|

|A ∩ λ−1A| ≤

|A|2 = Xλ∈Q

t

Xj=1 Xλ∈xj A

|A ∩ λ−1A| =

t

Xj=1 Xλ∈xjA

|(xjA) ∩ λ−1(xjA)| .

Hence there is j ∈ [t] such that

|A|2

t

≤ Xλ∈xj A

|(xjA) ∩ λ−1(xjA)| .

With some abuse of the notation redeﬁne A to be xjA and thus, we have

|A|2

t

≤ Xλ∈A

|A ∩ λ−1A| = Xλ∈A

|Aλ| .

Further, using the previous arguments, we get

E×(Q + α/a, Q + β/a′) ≪ M 4|A|4 log |A| ,

(20)

(21)

(22)

Xa,a′∈A
Xa,a′∈A

and

E×(Π + αa, Π + βa′) ≪ M 4|A|4 log |A| .

Let us consider the case of the set Q, the second situation is similar. From (21), we see that
there are a, a′ ∈ A such that

σ := |{(q1a + α)(q′

1a′ + β) = (q2a + α)(q′

2a′ + β) : q1, q′

1, q2, q′

Using the inclusion A ⊆ Qa, a ∈ A once more time, it is easy to check that

σ ≥ |{(a1 + α)(a′

1 + β) = (a2 + α)(a′

2 + β) : a1, a2 ∈ A, a′

1 ∈ Aa1, a′

2 ∈ Aa2 }| =Xx

n2(x) ,

where

n(x) = |{(a1 + α)(a′

1 + β) = x : a1 ∈ A, a′

1 ∈ Aa1 }| .

Clearly, the support of the function n(x) is 3A + αβ. Using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality and
bound (20), we obtain

|A|4

t2 ≤ Xλ∈A

|Aλ|!2

= Xx

n(x)!2

≤ |3A| ·Xx

as required.

n2(x) ≤ |3A| · σ ≪ |3A| · M 4|A|2 log |A|

✷

5 Further remarks

Now let us make some further remarks on sets with small quotient/product set. First of all let us
say a few words about multiple sumsets kA of sets A with small multiplicative doubling. As was
noted before when k tends to inﬁnity the best results in the direction were obtained in [1]. For
small k > 3 another methods work. We follow the arguments from [8] with some modiﬁcations.

Suppose that A ⊂ G is a ﬁnite set, where G is an abelian group with the group operation
×. Put kAkU k to be Gowers non–normalized kth–norm [6] of the characteristic function of A (in
multiplicative form), see, say [15]. For example, kAkU 2 = E×(A) is the multiplicative energy of
A and

kAkU 3 = Xλ∈A/A

E×(Aλ) .

Moreover, the induction property for Gowers norms holds, see [6]

kAkU k+1 = Xλ∈A/A

kAλkU k .

(23)

It was proved in [6] that kth–norms of the characteristic function of any set are connected
to each other. In [15] the author shows that the connection for the non–normalized norms does
not depend on the size of G. Here we formulate a particular case of Proposition 35 from [15],
which connects kAkU k and kAkU 2 , see Remark 36 here.

Lemma 13 Let A be a ﬁnite subset of an abelian group G with the group operation ×. Then
for any integer k ≥ 1 one has

kAkU k ≥ E×(A)2k−k−1|A|−(3·2k−4k−4) .

10

Now let us prove a lower bound for |kA|, where A has small product/quotient set. The
obtained estimate gives us a connection between the size of sumsets of a set and Gowers norms
of its characteristic function.

Proposition 14 Let A ⊂ R be a ﬁnite set, and k be a positive integer. Then

|2kA|2 ≫k kAkU k+1 · log−k |A| .

(24)

P r o o f. We follow the arguments from [8]. Let us use the induction. The case k = 1 was obtained
in [20], so assume that k > 1. Put L = log |A|.

Without loosing of generality one can suppose that 0 /∈ A. Taking any subset S = {s1 <

s2 < · · · < sr} of A/A, we have by the main argument of [8]

|2kA|2 ≥

r−1

Xj=1

|2k−1Asj ||2k−1Asj+1| .

(25)

Now let S be a subset of A/A such that Ps∈S |2k−1As|2 ≫k L−1Ps |2k−1As|2 and for any two

numbers s, s′ the quantities |2k−1As|, |2k−1As′| diﬀer at most twice on S. Clearly, such S exists
by the pigeonhole principle. Further, put ∆ = mins∈S |2k−1As|. Thus, putting the set S into
(25), we get

|2kA|2 ≫k ∆Xs∈S

|2k−1As| ≫k L−1Xs

|2k−1As|2 .

Now by the induction hypothesis and formula (23), we see that

|2kA|2 ≫k L−kXs

kAskU k = L−kkAkU k+1 .

This completes the proof.

Proposition above has an immediate consequence.

Corollary 15 Let A ⊂ R be a ﬁnite set, and k be a positive integer. Let also M ≥ 1, and

Then

where

|AA| ≤ M |A|

or

|A/A| ≤ M |A| .

|2kA| ≫k |A|1+k/2M −uk · log−k/2 |A| ,

uk = 2k − k/2 − 1 .

✷

(26)

(27)

I. D. Shkredov

11

P r o o f. Combining Proposition 14 and Corollary 15, we obtain

|2kA|2 ≫k log−k |A| · E×(A)2k+1−k−2|A|−(3·2k+1−4k−8) .

(28)

By assumption (26) and the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality (4), we get E×(A) ≥ |A|3/M . Substi-
tuting the last bound into (28), we have

|2kA|2 ≫k log−k |A| · |A|k+2M −(2k+1−k−2)

as required.

✷

Thus, for |AA| ≪ |A| or |A/A| ≪ |A|, we have, in particular, that |4A| & |A|2. Actually, a

stronger bound takes place. We thank to S.V. Konyagin for pointed this fact to us.

Corollary 16 Let A ⊂ R be a ﬁnite set with |A/A| ≪ |A|. Then

|4A| & |A|2+c ,

where c > 0 is an absolute constant.

P r o o f. Without loosing of generality one can suppose that 0 /∈ A. We use the arguments and
the notation of the proof of Proposition 14. By formula (25), we have

|4A|2 ≥

r−1

Xj=1

|Asj + Asj ||Asj+1 + Asj+1| .

(29)

By Theorem 11 from [16] for any ﬁnite B ⊂ R one has |B + B| &M (B) |B|3/2+c, where c > 0

two numbers s, s′ the quantities |As|, |As′| diﬀer at most twice on S. Clearly, such S exists
by the pigeonhole principle. Further, put ∆ = mins∈S |As|. By the H¨older inequality and our

is an absolute constant. Choose our set S such that Ps∈S |As|3+2c & Ps |As|3+2c and for any
assumption |A/A| ≪ |A| one has Ps |As|3+2c ≫ |A|4+2c and hence ∆ ≫ |A|. It follows that

M (As) ≪ 1 for any s ∈ S (see the deﬁnition of the quantity M (As) in (7)). Applying Theorem
11 from [16] for sets Asj , combining with (29) and the previous calculations, we obtain

|4A|2 &Xs∈S

|As|3+2c &Xs

|As|3+2c ≫ |A|4+2c .

This completes the proof.

✷

The proof of our last proposition of this paper uses the same idea as the arguments of
Theorem 12 and improves symmetric case of Lemma 33 from [18] for small M . The result is
simple but it shows that for any set with small |AA| or |A/A| there is a ”coset” splitting, similar
to multiplicative subgroups in F∗
p.

12

Proposition 17 Let p be a prime number and A ⊆ Fp be a set, |AA| ≪ p2/3. Put |AA| = M |A|.
Then

If |A/A| = M |A| and M 4|A|3 ≪ p2 then

|A ∩ (A + x)| ≪ M 9/4|A|3/4 .

max
x6=0

|A ∩ (A + x)| ≪ M 3|A|3/4 .

max
x6=0

P r o o f. Without loosing of generality one can suppose that 0 /∈ A. Let Π = AA, Q = A/A.
First of all, let us prove (30). It is easy to see that for any x ∈ F∗

p the following holds

(A ◦ A)(x) ≤ (Π ◦ Π)(x/a)

for all

a ∈ A .

Hence

(A ◦ A)2(x) ≤ |A|−1Xa∈A

(Π ◦ Π)2(x/a) ≤ |A|−1Xa

(Π ◦ Π)2(a) = |A|−1E+(Π) .

(32)

(33)

By Lemma 3 there is A′ ⊆ A, |A′| ≥ |A|/2 such that |A′Π| ≪ M 2|A|. In particular, |Π||A′||A′Π| ≪
M 3|A|3 ≪ p2. Using Theorem 9 with A = C = Π and B = A′, we get

E+(Π) ≪ M 9/2|A|5/2 .

Combining the last bound with (33), we obtain (30).

To prove (31), note that the following analog of formula (32) takes place

(A ◦ A)(x) ≤ (Q ◦ Q)(ax)

for all

a ∈ A

(34)

and we can apply the previous arguments. In the situation by formula (5) of Lemma 3 one has
|QA| ≤ M 3|A| and thus Theorem 9 with A = C = Q and B = A gives us

|A| · max
x6=0

(A ◦ A)2(x) ≤ E+(Q) ≪ M 6|A|5/2 .

✷

This completes the proof.
