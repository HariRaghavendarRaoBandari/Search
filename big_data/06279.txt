Abstract

The equation of state associated with N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
in 4 dimensions, for SU(N) in the large N limit, is investigated using the
AdS/CFT correspondence. An asymptotically AdS black-hole on the grav-
ity side provides a thermal background for the Yang-Mills theory on the
boundary in which the cosmological constant is equivalent to a volume. The
thermodynamic variable conjugate to the cosmological constant is a pressure
and the P − V diagram is studied. It is known that there is a critical point
where the heat capacity diverges and this is reﬂected in the isothermal com-
pressibility. Critical exponents are derived and found to be mean ﬁeld in
the large N limit. The same analysis applied to 3 and 6 dimensional con-
formal ﬁeld theories again yields mean ﬁeld exponents associated with the
compressibility at the critical point.1

Introduction

Ever since Bekenstein’s discovery of the relation between entropy and the
area of a black hole’s event horizon [1] and Hawking’s subsequent observation
that black holes have an intrinsic temperature associated with them [2], the
subject of black hole thermodynamics has been a fascinating area of research.
Indeed black hole thermodynamics now has potentially great usefulness in
providing insights into the thermodynamics of conformal theories via the
AdS/CFT correspondence [3].

An interesting aspect of black hole thermodynamics is the role of the
cosmological constant, Λ, as a thermodynamic variable: an idea originally
considered in [5] and re-visited in [6]. Since Λ has the natural physical
interpretation of pressure in the bulk, the conjugate variable is a volume and
this has led to some intriguing recent results for the pressure and volume of
black holes, with phase transitions and critical points showing very similar
properties to liquid-gas phase transitions [7, 8]. For Einstein gravity in the
bulk, the critical exponents are mean ﬁeld for all black hole solutions studied
to date, leading to an analogy with the liquid-gas transition of a van der
Waals ﬂuid.

In the context of AdS/CFT it was suggested in [6, 9] that varying the cos-
mological constant in the bulk should be associated with varying the number
of colors in the boundary CFT and this proposal was investigated in more
detail in [10], where the thermodynamically conjugate variable to Λ was in-
terpreted as a kind of chemical potential for color.

An alternative approach is followed here based on a diﬀerent interpreta-
tion of the thermodynamic signiﬁcance of Λ which provides a length scale in
the CFT. When global AdS co-ordinates are used the CFT on the boundary
has a ﬁnite volume, determined by Λ, hence varying Λ in the bulk corresponds
to varying the volume of the CFT on the boundary. If Λ gives the volume
of the CFT then the thermodynamically conjugate variable is the pressure
and one is led to the construction of P − V diagrams for the CFT, in which
the pressure and volume are interchanged relative to their roles in the bulk.
This can be achieved while keeping the number of colors ﬁxed provided the
higher dimensional Newton’s constant is adjusted as Λ is varied, as suggested
in [11]. In 10-dimensional string theory, for example, Newton’s constant is
related to the string coupling constant and tension by G10 = 8π6g2
s (α′)4 so
varying G10 can be thought of as varying gs with the tension ﬁxed.

In this paper the P − V diagram associated with 4-dimensional N =

2

4 SUSY SU(N) Yang-Mills theory at large N is investigated using the
AdS/CFT correspondence. When the bulk contains a black hole there is
a ﬁrst order phase transition [12] which is associated with the deconﬁning
transition for the quark-gluon plasma on the boundary [13]. When the black
hole carries a U(1) charge, corresponding to R-charge in the Yang-Mills the-
ory, this phase transition is one end of a line of ﬁrst order phase transitions
while the other end terminates at a second order transition where the heat
capacity at constant volume for the Yang-Mills theory diverges [14].

The critical exponents in the bulk gravitational theory, with charge as
the order parameter and temperature as the control parameter, are known
to be mean ﬁeld, [15], and so CV is ﬁnite at the critical point for the black
hole in the bulk. At ﬁrst site this is at odds with the statement in [14] that
there is a critical point in the CFT at which CV diverges. We shall show that
there is no contradiction here and, when interpreted correctly, the boundary
CFT has mean ﬁeld exponents.
In terms of pressure and volume there is
a number of aspects aspects of the phase transition that make it diﬀerent
from more usual cases. Firstly there is a single phase at low temperatures
and the two phase regime exists for temperatures above the critical point
[14]; secondly, above the critical point, along the line of ﬁrst order phase
transitions, it is the pressure that jumps across the phase transition, not the
volume, so it is more appropriate to use the pressure as an order parameter
rather than the more usual volume; thirdly the conformal symmetry dictates
that volume and temperature are not fully independent and it is better to
use charge as the control parameter rather than the temperature. This last
point of view is more in keeping with the notion of the phase transition
being a quantum phase transition rather than a thermal phase transition.
With this interpretation the critical exponents for pressure and volume of
the Yang-Mills theory are calculated in the large N limit and shown to be
mean ﬁeld.

The general structure is the same for the 3-dimensional and 6-dimensional
CFT’s considered in [4], in particular the critical exponents at large N are
mean ﬁeld in all three conformal ﬁeld theories.

In section 2 the black hole thermodynamics of the relevant bulk solution is
summarized and is related to that of the boundary CFT in section 3. Section
4 analyzes the case of N = 4 SUSY Yang-Mills in detail, the P − V diagram
is constructed and critical exponents for the deconﬁning phase transition in
the large N limit are calculated. Finally section 5 summarizes the results.
Some technical details are in two appendices.

2 The bulk

In D space-time dimensions the Lagrangian for Einstein gravity, with a cos-
mological constant Λ, coupled to a U(1) gauge ﬁeld, is

(R − 2Λ − F 2).

(1)

The normalization of F is the same as in [14], it has dimensions of inverse
length.

A solution of the equations of motion arising from (1), corresponding a
spherical charged asymptotically AdS black hole in D space-time dimensions
is easily written down. In global co-coordinates the gauge potential is

that the gauge ﬁeld F = dA satisﬁes Gauss law

The normalization of the U(1) charge eQ here is determined by requiring

eQ =ZSD−2 ∗F

where SD−2 is a sphere containing the charge.

In the context of superstring theory, the D-dimensional Newton’s con-
stant GD is descended from Newton’s constant in the full D-dimensional
theory (D = 10 or 11). Compactifying the higher dimensional theory on a
(D − D)-dimensional compact space KD−D, with size L , allows for a direct

5

product D-dimensional space-time MD × KD−D, where MD is the asymp-
totically AdSD with line-element (4), and

(13)

where C is a dimensionless number determined by the metric on KD−D.
The AdS length scale L is not intrinsic to the D-dimensional action, but is
merely a parameter in a classical solution of the D-dimensional theory and
it is perfectly reasonable to consider varying L in the solution.

3 Thermodynamics of the boundary ﬁeld the-

ory

In the AdS/CFT correspondence the boundary CFT theory has d = D − 2
space dimensions. With the global co-oordinates used in the previous section,
the (d + 1)-dimensional space-time metric at ﬁxed r is

d2s = −f (r)dt2 + r2d2Ωd −→r→∞

r2
L2 (−dt2 + L2d2Ωd),

(14)

which is conformal to a (d + 1)-dimensional space-time with constant time
spatial volume

V = ΩdLd,

(15)

and this can be interpreted as the spatial volume of the boundary conformal
ﬁeld theory.

The dimensionless ratio of the AdS length scale L to the D-dimensional
Planck length in the bulk determines the number of degrees of freedom in
the boundary ﬁeld theory [4].

The most studied case is D = 10 compactiﬁed on S5, with D = 5. the
boundary CFT is then N = 4 SUSY SU(N) Yang-Mills theory, when the
classical solution in the bulk (4) is relevant for large N. This has 16N 2
degrees of freedom (8N 2 bosonic and 8N 2 fermionic) and the large N limit
is the weak gravity limit:

L8
¯hG10

=

2N 2
π4 ,

V ol(S5) = π3L5,

1

¯hG5

=

2N 2
πL3 .

(16)

6

¯hG10 is of course related to the 10-dimensional Planck length, ¯hG10 = l8
P l
and, as usual, large N is related to the classical limit of the bulk theory, in
which L >> lP l.

The CFT is on a 3-sphere with volume
V = 2π2L3

(17)

and the inverse of the 5-dimensional Planck length (16) is related to the
number of degrees of freedom per unit volume of the CFT

1

4π¯hG5

=

N 2
V

,

(18)

so varying the volume of the CFT, keeping N 2 ﬁxed, is completely equivalent
to varying the 5-dimensional Planck length.

The entropy is proportional to N 2 (with x := rh

L as before)

as is the dimensionless charge

S = πN 2x3.

Q = eQL

4π¯hG5

= √3N 2y,

where y := q

L2 .

On dimensional grounds the internal energy U(S, V, Q) = M is of the

form

U(S, V, Q) =

¯h

1

3

V

u(S, Q),

(21)

with u(S, Q) a dimensionless function of dimensionless variables. The ther-
modynamics of the CFT is determined by the functional dependence of the
mass on S, Q and V (or equivalently, x, y and L), explicitly

(20)

(22)

M =

N 2¯h

L (cid:18)x4 + x2 +

y2

x2(cid:19) .

Two other interesting cases are the 3-dimensional CFT obtained from
M-theory in D = 11 compactiﬁed on AdS4 × S7 (more generally S7/k for
integral k, [3, 14]) and the 6-dimensional CFT obtained from M-theory in
D = 11 compactiﬁed on AdS7 × S4. For these two cases the N 2 behavior
of the “extensive” quantities M, S and Q is replaced with N 3/2 and N 3
respectively and the powers of x change as in equations (11) and (12) but
otherwise the analysis of the thermodynamics is similar to the case D = 10
and D = 5 studied in §4 below.

4 The thermodynamics of N = 2 SUSY Yang-

Mills

To explore the thermodynamics of the CFT fully we wish to ﬁx N and allow
S, Q and V to vary. This means we must vary L, but at the same time vary
the D-dimensional Newton constant in such a way that N 2 in is ﬁxed in the
ﬁrst equation of (16), [11].
For concreteness we shall focus on D = D = 5, the general structure is the
same the other two cases, in particular the critical exponents are the same.
Thermodynamically we interpret M = U(S, Q, V ) in (22) as the internal
energy of the large N Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling,

U =

3
4

N 2¯h

L (cid:18)x4 + x2 +

y2

x2(cid:19) .

(23)

Note that, while the mass in the bulk is classical, the internal energy of the
CFT is quantum mechanical and vanishes as ¯h → 0 with x and y ﬁxed.

The temperature is then

T =

(24)

in the deconﬁned phase this is interpreted as the temperature of the quark-
gluon plasma [13, 14].
The pressure is [11]

These expressions simplify at high T (large x) when the event horizon
curvature and the charge are negligible. This is deep into the de-conﬁned
phase of the quark-gluon plasma and in this limit

S =

2¯h3 V T 3,

P =

and

Φ =

V N 2T 2 .

(29)

Since T ∝ ¯h we see that the pressure and the chemical potential here are of
quantum mechanical origin.
At ﬁxed charge and temperature there is a phase transition [14], an ex-

tension of the eQ = 0 Hawking-Page phase transition in the bulk [12], which

is interpreted as the deconﬁning phase transition in the boundary Yang-Mills
theory [13]. The heat capacity

CV,Q = T

diverges when ∂T

vanishes and there is a critical point when

∂S

Conformal invariance dictates that only the combination V
at critical point, V and T are not ﬁxed separately.2

2Finite temperature ﬁeld theory is associated with periodicity in Euclidean time with
1
period 1/T and Euclidean time parameterizes a circle S1 of radius
2πT . The spatial
geometry is S3 with radius L and, because the theory is conformal, the physics can only
depend on the ratio of the radii of these two spheres, namely 2πT L. The physics depends
on V

3 T , not on V and T separately, [13].

The critical exponent α can easily be determined by ﬁxing y = y∗ and

expanding 1/CV,Q around x∗. With x = (1 + ε)/√3

CV,Q(x, y∗) ∝ ε2

(33)

α can be extracted by similarly expanding the reduced temperature at con-
stant volume,

which gives

The critical exponent follows from CV,Q ∼ |t|−α with

t ∝ ε3.

α =

(34)

(35)

(36)

(37)

This singularity in the heat capacity was not found in the bulk thermody-
namics of higher dimensional asymptotically AdS charged black holes studied
in [15, 16], these authors found a critical point in the bulk but the exponents
were mean ﬁeld and CV,Q is ﬁnite there. To understand this apparent con-
tradiction we write the full equation of state in terms of Q and Φ. Using
(20) and (28) to eliminate x in favor of Q and Φ in (24) gives the equation
of state

T =

Expanding about the critical point (31) with y = y∗(1 + η), T = T∗(1 + t)
and Φ = Φ∗(1 + ϕ), where LΦ∗ := 1

t = −

(2 + 5ϕ) −

ϕ3 + o(ϕ4, ηϕ2, η2).

(38)

Aside from a change in the sign of t this has the same analytic structure as
the equation of state for a van der Waals gas [15] which, in reduced variables
p = P−P∗
P∗

and v = V −V∗
V∗

, reads

t =

(39)

10

The van der Waals equation of state has mean ﬁeld exponents, so one expects
α = 0. The previous calculation gave α = 2
3 because Q was held ﬁxed (ﬁxed
η) but the order parameter for the liquid-gas phase transition in the van
der Waals gas is v, which would be analogous to ϕ in (38). Indeed CV,Φ is
perfectly ﬁnite, [14], so α is indeed zero for ﬁxed Φ, which is the analogue of
the van der Waals case.

If Q is the order parameter the usual exponents are deﬁned by

η ∼ |t|β,

ϕ ∼ |η|δ

and the response function,

χT =

behaves as

,

∂Q

∂Φ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)T

β = 1,

γ = −

and

δ =

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

While these exponents, together with α = 2
Widom scaling relations

3, do satisfy the Rushbrooke and

α + 2β + γ = 2,

γ = β(δ − 1)

(44)

there is a diﬃculty in that γ is negative so the response function vanishes at
critically rather than diverging. As indicated in (42) the response function
χT can be negative near the critical point,

5(2η + 3φ2)

< 0 for

η = 0,

(45)

∂η

∂ϕ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t ≈ −

and this is the instability found in [17].3 It was also shown in [17] that Φ
jumps across the phase transition in the two phase regime, suggesting that
Φ is the order parameter for this transition.

3The same instability is also present for rotating Myers-Perry black holes with ﬁxed
angular momenta, which have a second order phase transition at a critical value of the
angular momenta [18, 19].

11

If Q is just ﬁxed from the start and not varied then there is no problem,
CV,Q diverges with exponent 2
3 and β, γ and δ are not relevant. But if we
wish to probe the system by adjusting Q then Φ should be viewed as the
order parameter, not Q. In that case CV,Q diverges as |t|−1 rather than |t|− 2
because it should be calculated for ϕ = 0 and not η = 0.
The other exponents, ϕ ∼ |t|β and ϕ ∼ |η|δ, are easily obtained from (38)

in the usual way and are found to be mean ﬁeld

3

α = 0,

β =

1
2

,

γ = 1

and

δ = 3.

(46)

In particular the heat capacity CV,Φ is ﬁnite (and negative) at the critical
point [14]. Mean ﬁeld behavior with Φ as the order parameter for the black
hole in the bulk was ﬁrst found in [15].

Alternatively the equation of state can be written in terms of the pres-
sure rather than the chemical potential to study the compressibility. The
adiabatic compressibility of the plasma follows easily from (25) and is

κS,Q = −

1
V

=

3
4P

,

(47)

∂V

∂P(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)S,Q

but the isothermal properties are more interesting.

It is shown in the appendix that the isothermal compressibility, κT,Q, is

given by

κT,Q =

9V

12P − T CV,Q

.

(48)

Hence κT,Q is vanishes at the critical point and is negative along Q = Q∗
close to the critical point when CV,Q∗ > 0 diverges. Thus the P -V response
function, κT,Q, behaves the same way as the Q-Φ response function χT . This
suggests that the order parameter here is P rather than V .

If this is a valid point of view we should focus on the heat capacity at

constant pressure, CP,Q, rather than CV,Q. Using the standard relation

equations (47) and (48) give

κSCP = κT CV

CP,Q =

12P V CV,Q
12P − T CV,Q

12

(49)

(50)

which is ﬁnite and negative when CV,Q diverges, just as CV,φ is. In particular
at the critical point

CP,Q = −12(cid:18)P V
T (cid:19)∗

7πN 2
4√3

.

= −

(51)

Thus, with P as the order parameter, α = 0 is mean ﬁeld. The negative
value of CP at the critical point is a reﬂection of the instability found above
in χT .

There is a subtlety in trying to extract β and δ as there is no independent
deﬁnition of a critical volume, V and T are linked due to conformal invari-
ance. In particular it would be dangerous to use the usual scaling relations
to derive β and δ from α and γ above as conformal invariance imposes an
extra constraint.

A reduced volume can be deﬁned as

v :=

V T 3 − (V T 3)∗

(V T 3)∗

(52)

but this is not a new variable since conformal invariance relates it directly
to t,

1 + v = (1 + t)3.

(53)

As a consequence the usual deﬁnitions of the exponents β and δ do not apply.
Since v and t are not independent it is better, when discussing pressure
and volume, to use η to probe the physics near the critical point rather than
t. Lines of equal charge in the P -V plane are plotted in ﬁgure 1 where P
and V are rendered dimensionless by multiplying by appropriate powers of
T . The isothermal compressibility is positive when the slope of the plotted
curves is negative and there are two regions in the P -V plane where this is
the case, the critical point lies on the boundary of the rightmost of these
regions which corresponds to Q < Q∗ and v > 0 (hence t > 0, i.e. the high
temperature regime). The pressure of the system jumps across the phase
transition.

To calculate critical exponents ﬁrst deﬁne a reduced pressure

p =

P − P∗

P∗

13

(54)

at ﬁxed volume.4 Then, with p as the order parameter and Q as the control
variable, β and δ are deﬁned by

|p| ∼ |η|β,

(55)

in analogy with the usual deﬁnition of β, but with t replaced by η and p as
the order parameter (so p and v are interchanged). Similarly

|v| ∼ |p|δ

for

η = 0.

Lastly the relevant response function is

− V

γ then follows from

= (κT,Q)−1.

∂P

∂V(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)T,Q

(κT,Q)−1 ∼ |η|−γ.

(56)

(57)

(58)

We leave the details to an appendix and here quote the result that β, γ and
δ are indeed mean ﬁeld. We conclude that, with the proper identiﬁcation of
the order parameter as being the thermodynamic variable that jumps across
the line of ﬁrst order phase transformations, the exponents are always mean
ﬁeld in the large N limit, both in the Φ-Q plane and the P -V plane.

5 Summary

The critical point of N = 4 SUSY SU(N) Yang-Mills in the large N limit,
ﬁrst found in [14, 17], is also visible in the P − V diagram of the quark-gluon
plasma. The volume here is provided by the cosmological constant in the 5-D
bulk, Λ = − 6
L2 , which is related to the volume of 3-space, S3, in the boundary
Yang-Mills theory by V = 2π2L3. The pressure is then deﬁned through the
thermodynamic relation P = − ∂U
∂V , where U is the internal energy of the
thermodynamic system — identiﬁed with the mass of the black hole in the
bulk. This is in contrast to the thermodynamics of the black hole itself, where
the roles of pressure and volume are reversed so that, on the gravity side,
the cosmological constant provides the pressure and the thermodynamically

conjugate variable is a volume and the black hole mass is the enthalpy of the
system [6].

There is a constraint on the thermodynamic variables, due to the fact
that the boundary ﬁeld theory is conformal, and only the combination V T 3
is relevant to the phase structure, not V and T separately. As a consequence
it seems better to use the charge rather than the temperature as the con-
trol parameter in discussing the thermodynamics. Then the pressure jumps
across the phase transition in the two phase regime. In the approximation
in which the ﬂuid is treated as a gas of non-interacting particles – quarks
and gluons in the plasma and non-interacting hadrons in the conﬁned phase
— this jump may be viewed as simply due to a change in the number of de-
grees of freedom: each degree of freedom contributes equally to the pressure
any change across the phase transition in the number of eﬀective degrees of
freedom contributes to a change in pressure.

With pressure as the control parameter in the P -V plane the exponents
are mean ﬁeld and the phase transition is in the same universality class as
the van der Waals gas. Mean ﬁeld exponents also characterize the phase
transition in the Φ-Q plane.

An unsatisfactory feature of the analysis is the instability associated with
the negative value of CP at the critical point, implying that the system is
unstable there when the pressure is ﬁxed. Although κT is positive in the
region enclosed by the black curve to the right of the critical point in ﬁgure
1 both CP and CV are negative there. The only region of the P − V plane
that has all three of CP , CV and κT positive is the region to the left of the
left-hand black curve in the ﬁgure, the single phase region. CP < 0 to the
right of this curve.

Instability in black hole thermodynamics is not new and indeed lies be-
hind the phenomenon of black hole evaporation — an asymptotically ﬂat
Schwarzschild black hole also has negative CP . Whether or not negative CP
is a problem is a question of time-scales, for Hawking radiation the time-scale
for black hole evaporation can be very large, so large that the system is es-
sentially quasi-static equilibrium and thermodynamic principles can still be
applied, at least at early times before the evaporation process has gone too
far. It is not clear whether the same thing can be said for the quark-gluon
plasma, or what the physical interpretation of the instability should be in
this case.

Although the analysis here has focused on the case of 4-dimensional
N = 4 SUSY SU(N) Yang-Mills, associated with string theory in D = 10

compactiﬁed on AdS5 × S5, the thermodynamics of the 3-dimensional and
6-dimensional CFTs, obtained from M-theory in D = 11 compactiﬁed on
AdS4 × S7/k and on AdS7 × S4 respectively, is essentially similar — the
critical exponents are mean ﬁeld in all three cases.
It would be of great interest to evaluate 1/N corrections to the exponents
but the method employed here relies on a representation of the thermody-
namic potentials arising from an exact solution of the Einstein equations in
the bulk. The paucity of known exact solutions relevant to the problem is
an obstacle to realizing 1/N corrections with this method. However it may
be possible to make some progress in studying 1/N corrections by adding a
Gauss-Bonnet term to the 5-D Einstein action [21].

Thus the isothermal compressibility, κT,Q vanishes at the critical point.

B Critical behavior of pressure, volume and

isothermal compressibility

To derive the critical exponents for pressure and volume, β, γ and δ, ﬁrst
express the temperature and the pressure in reduced variables, t = T
T∗ − 1
and p = P

P∗ − 1 at constant volume, equation (24) reads

η(2 + η) + 24t(1 + ε)5 = 20ε3 + 45ε4 + 36ε5 + 10ε6,

(69)

17

while eliminating y = y∗(1 + η) in favor of T in (25) gives
7p + 8t(1 + ε)3 = 16ε + 16ε2 + 12ε3 + 5ε4.

With the deﬁnition of reduced volume (52),

v = (1 + t)3 − 1,

(70)

(71)

equations (69) and (70) can be re-arranged to give explicit expressions for
v(ε, η) and p(ε, η) which, when expanded around the critical point, yield

With p as the order parameter and η as the control parameter the Maxwell
construction demands that the integral of v(p, η) along a curve of constant
η, between two values p< and p> on either side of the critical point with
v(p<) = v(p>) = v0, should satisfy

to have the same value at the two endpoints of integration, p< = p(ε<) and

Equation (72) implies that v(ǫ<) = v(ε>)+ o (ε4) if η = −2ε2
which case the integral is o (ε5

The exponent γ is obtained from the isothermal compressibility in equa-
tion (48) (equation (70) should not be used for diﬀerentiation here as p is
deﬁned at ﬁxed volume, not at ﬁxed temperature)

κT,Q = −

12π2L4 (2 x6 − x4 + 5 y2) x2

N 2 (2 x10 − 18 x6y2 + 3 x8 − 10 x4y2 − 9 y4)

.

(79)

Expanding this around the critical point one ﬁnds that κT,Q vanishes like

κT,Q ∝ −η − 6ε2 + o(η2, ε3) = 12t(1 + 5ε) − 6ε2 + o(t2, tε2, ε3)

(80)

where (69) has been used to eliminate η in the second equation. Now we can
set p = 0 in (70) and equation (69) then implies ε ≈ 1
κT,Q ∼ −η + o(η2) ∼ 12t + o(t2).

2t and η ∼ −24ε, so

(81)

Hence (κT,Q)−1 ∼ 1/|η| ∼ 1/t at the critical pressure and, with pressure as
the order parameter, γ = 1. In the 2-phase regime (η < 0) the isothermal
compressibility is positive, but it is negative for η = 0.

Lastly setting η = 0 in the parametric equation of state (72) and (73)

implies that p ≈ 16

7 ε and v ≈ 5

2ε3 so

and hence δ = 3.
