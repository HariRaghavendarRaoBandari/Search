ABSTRACT
To investigate if magnetic ﬁelds are present in Wolf-Rayet stars, we selected a few stars in
the Galaxy and one in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We acquired low-resolution spec-
tropolarimetric observations with the ESO FORS 2 instrument during two diﬀerent observing
runs. During the ﬁrst run in visitor mode, we observed the LMC Wolf-Rayet star BAT99 7
and the stars WR 6, WR 7, WR 18, and WR 23 in our Galaxy. The second run in service
mode was focused on monitoring the star WR 6. Linear polarization was recorded imme-
diately after the observations of circular polarization. During our visitor observing run, the
magnetic ﬁeld for the cyclically variable star WR 6 was measured at a signiﬁcance level of
3.3σ (hBzi = 258 ± 78 G). Among the other targets, the highest value for the longitudinal
magnetic ﬁeld, hBzi = 327 ± 141 G, was measured in the LMC star BAT99 7. Spectropolari-
metric monitoring of the star WR 6 revealed a sinusoidal nature of the hBzi variations with
the known rotation period of 3.77 d, signiﬁcantly adding to the conﬁdence in the detection.
The presence of the rotation-modulated magnetic variability is also indicated in our frequency
periodogram. The reported ﬁeld magnitude suﬀers from signiﬁcant systematic uncertainties
at the factor 2 level, in addition to the quoted statistical uncertainties, owing to the theoretical
approach used to characterize it. Linear polarization measurements showed no line eﬀect in
the stars, apart from WR 6. BAT99 7, WR 7, and WR 23 do not show variability of the linear
polarization over two nights.

1 INTRODUCTION

Magnetic ﬁelds are now believed to play an important role in
the evolution of massive stars. A Tayler-Spruit dynamo mech-
anism (Spruit 2002) has been predicted to be eﬃcient in ra-
diative layers of the stellar interior. However, these ﬁelds per-
haps do not reach the photosphere with a measurable strength.
Cantiello et al. (2009) showed that subsurface convection zones
may be present in massive stars. If a dynamo operates in such a
zone, a magnetic ﬁeld could emerge to produce observable phe-
nomena such as magnetic spots or hot plasma close to the stellar
surface (e.g., Waldron & Cassinelli 2007; Ramiaramanantsoa et al.

2014). Maeder & Meynet (2005) examined the eﬀect of magnetic
ﬁelds on the transport of angular momentum and chemical mix-
ing, and found that the potential inﬂuence on the evolution of mas-
sive stars is drastic. Thus magnetic ﬁelds might change our whole
picture about the evolution from O stars via Wolf-Rayet (WR)
stars to supernovae/gamma-ray bursts. Hitherto, neglecting mag-
netic ﬁelds might be one of the reasons why models and observa-
tions of massive-star populations are still in conﬂict (Hamann et al.
2006). Another potential importance of magnetic ﬁelds in mas-
sive stars concerns the dynamics of the stellar winds. Wherever
∗ > ˙M∞, it ushers a transition to magnetic control of the wind.
B2R2
If the ﬁeld is weaker than this limit, the ﬁeld lines are carried along
with the wind of mass-loss rate ˙M and (terminal) velocity ∞, and
become more or less radial (e.g. ud-Doula & Owocki 2002).

Our long-standing interest is to understand WR stars in all

their aspects, including their magnetic ﬁelds. Classical WR stars
are massive stars that have lost their outer layers in a relatively
short time. Thus, if a massive star has an interior dynamo as pre-
dicted by the Tayler-Spruit mechanism, the magnetized layers can
now be displayed in the atmosphere with a ﬁeld strength of many
kG (Mullan & MacDonald 2005) or being even further condensed
by the progressing stellar contraction.

There is indirect evidence, e.g. from spectral variability and
X-ray emission, that magnetic ﬁelds are present in WR atmo-
spheres (e.g. Michaux et al. 2014). Also the theoretical work of
Gayley & Ignace (2010) predicts a degree of circular polarization
of a few times 10−4 for magnetic ﬁelds of about 100 G. The de-
tection of magnetic ﬁelds is however diﬃcult, chieﬂy because the
line spectrum is formed in the strong stellar wind. This does not
only imply a dilution of the ﬁeld at the place of line formation.
The big problem is the wind broadening of the emission lines by
Doppler shifts with wind velocities of a few thousand km s−1. In
high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations, some broad spec-
tral lines extend over adjacent orders, so that it is necessary to
adopt the order shapes to get the best continuum normalization.
In view of such immense line broadening in WR stars, to search for
a weak magnetic ﬁeld, we decided to use the low-resolution VLT
instrument FORS 2 (FOcal Reducer low dispersion Spectrograph)
mounted at the 8-m Antu telescope, which appears to be one of the
most suitable instruments in the world oﬀering low resolution and
the required spectropolarimetric sensitivity.

Our sample of WR stars selected for the search of the presence
of magnetic ﬁelds includes two rather bright WN4 stars, WR 6 and
WR 18, and the WC6 star WR 23. Since the rotation period of WR 6
(Prot = 3.77 d) was already determined and conﬁrmed in the past
by several teams (e.g., Lamontagne et al. 1986), one of our goals is
to assess the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld and its potential cyclical
modulation over the rotation cycle, as expected for tilted dipole or
split monopole geometries. Further, from our previous comprehen-
sive analyses using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet model atmospheres,
we have identiﬁed a few Wolf-Rayet stars in the Galaxy and the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that are in an extremely advanced
stage of their evolution, being very compact (R <∼ 2 R⊙) and hot
(Teﬀ > 100 kK). Having lost their outer layers, they now expose
their cores and are promising targets to search for the presence of
a magnetic ﬁeld. The sample of Galactic WR stars with such very
small stellar radii is very limited (cf. Hamann et al. 2006). Among
them, WR 7 is the best candidate to be observed from the VLT ob-
servatory located on Cerro Paranal.

Additionally, probably for reasons of stellar evolution in the
lower metallicity environment, the WN population in the LMC
shows a higher fraction of very hot and compact WN stars (e.g.,
Hainich et al. 2014). We have chosen the brightest of these LMC
objects, BAT99 7, as another target. BAT99 7 has an additional pe-
culiarity that makes it an especially promising candidate for show-
ing a strong magnetic ﬁeld, which concerns the shape of its line
proﬁles. These proﬁle shapes are very round, unlike the Gaussian
shape that is usually found in WR-type emission lines. We have
found such type of line proﬁles in only two Galactic WR stars, but
in ﬁve WN stars from the LMC. The reason for this proﬁle shape
is not clear. Model atmospheres are not able to reproduce it, unless
one assumes broadening by extremely fast rotation. In the case of
BAT99 7, we estimate a v sin i of 1900 km s−1 to account for the
proﬁle shape when applying just ﬂux convolution. Given the com-
pactness of the star, such fast rotation is not impossible but close
to the breakup limit, making these stars good GRB candidates. Ro-
tational broadening may be enhanced by wind corotation enforced

by a strong magnetic ﬁeld, while the rotation itself can strengthen
the dynamo.

WR 7 does not show such round line proﬁles, but is one of
the few Wolf-Rayet stars that have been found to be X-ray ac-
tive. The origin of X-rays from single-star winds is still under de-
bate, and can be attributed either to wind shocks from the deshad-
owing instability (Gayley & Owocki 1995; Feldmeier et al. 1997),
or Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) (Mullan 1984), or to
magnetic eﬀects (e.g., Waldron & Cassinelli 2009; Oskinova et al.
2009). BAT99 7 has not been seen in X-rays yet, but due to its large
distance there is no tight upper limit either.

We note that a detailed quantitative spectral analysis of all
stars in our sample was already carried out in previous studies (e.g.,
Hamann et al. 2006; Sander et al. 2012; Shenar et al. 2014). Any
binary suspects are excluded from our target selection to avoid con-
fusion between the magnetic ﬁeld measurements and eﬀects from
colliding stellar winds.

In Section 2, we give an overview of our spectropolarimetric
observations and the data reduction, followed by the presentation
of the results of the magnetic ﬁeld measurements for the individ-
ual stars in Section 3. Section 4 describes our measurement error
validation using a synthetic spectrum and Section 5 is devoted to
observations of the linear polarization. Finally, we summarize the
results of our observations in Section 6.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

The spectropolarimetric data presented in this paper were ob-
tained with the FORS 2 instrument (Appenzeller et al. 1998) during
two diﬀerent observing runs. FORS 2 is a multi-mode instrument
equipped with polarization analyzing optics, comprising super-
achromatic half-wave and quarter-wave phase retarder plates, and
a Wollaston prism with a beam divergence of 22′′ in standard res-
olution mode. The ﬁrst run took place in visitor mode during the
two nights in 2010 December 23 and 24. During this run, the WR
stars BAT99 7, WR 7, and WR 23 were observed twice and the stars
WR 6 and WR 18 once. An overview of the observed targets dur-
ing this visitor run including their types and visual magnitudes is
presented in Table 1.

An examination of the data obtained during the ﬁrst run re-
vealed the strongest evidence for the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld
in the cyclically variable star WR 6, for which a photometric peri-
odicity of 3.77 d was detected by Lamontagne et al. (1986). Moti-
vated by this detection, we applied for a second observing run in
service mode, consisting of twelve randomly distributed individ-
ual observations to sample the stellar rotation period. The detection
of rotational modulation of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld would
constrain the global ﬁeld geometry necessary to support physical
modeling of the spectroscopic and light variations. The observing

log of the service mode observations is presented in Table 2, to-
gether with the rotation phases, the elapsed rotation cycles and the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the continuum. The rotation cycle
0 was assumed to begin at the start of our monitoring of WR 6 in
service mode, i.e. on 2011 October 10. As the spectra of WR stars
are dominated by wind emission lines, with the strongest emission
appearing in the line He ii λ4686, special care was taken not to sat-
urate this line with the achieved SNR of a few thousand per pixel.
During both runs, for all targets, linear polarization was recorded
immediately after the observations of circular polarization.

For all spectropolarimetric observations, we used the grism
600B, which has an average spectral dispersion of 0.75 Å/pixel.
The use of the mosaic detector with a pixel size of 15 µm allowed
us to cover the spectral range from 3250 to 6215 Å. During the run
in 2010, due to its faintness, the star BAT99 7 was observed with a
0.6′′ slit and a binning of 2 along the wavelength axis, which results
in a spectral resolving power of 670. The other stars (WR 6, WR 7,
WR 18, and WR 23) are galactic WR stars and were observed with a
0.5′′ slit (R ∼ 1600). Three of these fours stars are of subtype WN4
and are believed to be single stars. WR 23 is of subtype WC6.

The respective phases for the twelve observations of WR 6 ob-
tained in service mode in 2011–2012 are presented in Table 2, in-
cluding the single observation obtained in 2010. For these observa-
tions, a slit width of 0.4′′ was used, resulting in a spectral resolving
power of ∼ 2000. Unfortunately, the observation of circular polar-
ization on the night 2011 October 11 had a very low SNR and could
not be used for the measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld.

The circular polarization observations were carried out using
the quarter-wave plate at the positions −45◦ and +45◦, whereby the
sequence −45◦, +45◦, +45◦, −45◦, −45◦, +45◦, . . . was adopted to
minimize the cross-talk eﬀect and to cancel errors from diﬀerent
transmission properties of the two polarised beams. Moreover, the
reversal of the quarter wave plate compensates for ﬁxed errors in
the relative wavelength calibrations of the two polarised spectra.

From the raw FORS 2 data, the parallel and perpendicular
beams are extracted using a pipeline written in the MIDAS environ-
ment by T. Szeifert, the very ﬁrst FORS instrument scientist. This
pipeline reduction by default includes background subtraction. A
unique wavelength calibration frame is used for each night.

FORS 2 spectropolarimetry of Wolf-Rayet stars

3

A ﬁrst description of the assessment of the longitudinal mag-
netic ﬁeld measurements using FORS 1/2 spectropolarimetric ob-
servations was presented in our previous work (e.g., Hubrig et al.
2004a,b, and references therein). A full description of the currently
updated data reduction and analysis will be presented in a separate
paper (Sch¨oller et al., in preparation). The V/I spectrum is calcu-
lated using:

V
I

=

1

2 (  f o − f e

f o + f e!−45◦

−  f o − f e

f o + f e!+45◦)

(1)

where +45◦ and −45◦ indicate the position angle of the retarder
waveplate and f o and f e are the ordinary and extraordinary beams,
respectively. Rectiﬁcation of the V/I spectra was performed in the
way described by Hubrig et al. (2014). Null proﬁles N are calcu-
lated as pairwise diﬀerences from all available V proﬁles. From
these, 3σ-outliers are identiﬁed and used to clip the V proﬁles. This
removes spurious signals, which mostly come from cosmic rays,
and also reduces the noise.

The strategy for detecting magnetic ﬁelds in this work is to
look for correlations between V/I and a proﬁle-dependent diag-
nostic that would be expected to yield V/I if magnetic ﬁelds are
present. Since the noise in the data precludes testing any speciﬁc
ﬁeld model, we note that for a ﬁeld with constant Bz everywhere,
we have the relation (Angel & Landstreet 1970)

V
I

= −

geﬀ e λ2

where V is the Stokes parameter that measures the circular polar-
ization, I is the intensity in the unpolarized spectrum, geﬀ is the
average eﬀective Land´e factor, e is the electron charge, λ is the
wavelength, me is the electron mass, c is the speed of light, dI/dλ
is the wavelength derivative of Stokes I, and hBzi is the mean lon-
gitudinal (line-of-sight) magnetic ﬁeld.

A ﬁeld with constant Bz is only schematic; it is not intended as
a quantiﬁcation of the actual average hBzi, merely as a way to char-
acterize it via an equivalent constant-Bz ﬁeld that would produce
the correlation in Eq. (2). For a real situation with spatially vary-
ing Bz, the explicit averaging that applies to hBzi implied in Eq. (2)
is only quantitatively deﬁned in the case of static atmospheres, but
certainly no correlation is expected between V and dI/dλ in the
absence of a magnetic ﬁeld. As shown in Gayley & Ignace (2010),
what is diﬀerent for a ﬁeld entrained in a hypersonic wind is that a
correlation between the wind ﬂow and the magnetic ﬁeld direction
induces a corresponding correlation between Doppler and Zeeman
shifts, altering Eq. (2) in ways that depend on the ﬁeld model. Since
the SNR in our data is not suﬃcient for creating detailed magnetic
ﬁeld models, our goal is only to characterize the overall magnitude
of the ﬁeld strength. Hence, it is suﬃcient for our purposes to use
any expression that gives accurate results for a spatially constant
Bz, thereby achieving only schematic accuracy at a level of roughly
a factor 2, when compared to more detailed or physically plausi-
ble magnetic ﬁeld models that the data simply lacks the precision
to support. The systematic uncertainty introduced by this approach
will be explored below, but we stress that the magnetic ﬁeld magni-
tudes cited here are all subject to signiﬁcant systematic uncertain-
ties due to the absence of a detailed magnetic ﬁeld model, and the
error margins quoted only include the observational uncertainties,
not the systematic ones that relate to a rather vague meaning of the
average line-of-sight magnetic ﬁeld hBzi in a hypersonic wind with
a spatially extended line-forming region and a rapidly falling mag-
netic ﬁeld strength. One may thus regard the mean magnetic ﬁeld

being measured as having the meaning of a spatially constant lon-
gitudinal magnetic ﬁeld equivalent; using that to constrain actual
magnetic ﬁeld models requires choosing a magnetic ﬁeld model
and is beyond the scope of this investigation.

With this caveat in place, this mean longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
was measured in two ways: using the entire spectrum including
all lines visible in the spectral region covered by FORS 2 (see e.g.
Hamann et al. 2006 for line identiﬁcation), and using all lines apart
from the line He ii λ4686, which is formed farthest in the stellar
wind. Featureless spectral regions were not included in the mea-
surements.

The mean longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld hBzi is deﬁned by the
slope of the weighted linear regression line through the measured
data points, where the weight of each data point is given by the
squared SNR of the Stokes V spectrum. The formal 1σ error of hBzi
is obtained from the standard relations for weighted linear regres-
sion. This error is inversely proportional to the rms SNR of Stokes
min/ν is applied to the error determined
from the linear regression, if larger than 1. Furthermore, we have
carried out Monte Carlo bootstrapping tests. These are most often
applied with the purpose of deriving robust estimates of standard
errors. In these tests, we generate 250 000 samples from the orig-
inal data that have the same size as the original data set and anal-
yse the distribution of the hBzi determined from all these newly
generated data sets. The measurement uncertainties obtained be-
fore and after the Monte Carlo bootstrapping tests were found to be
in close agreement, indicating the absence of reduction ﬂaws. To
check the stability of the spectral lines along the full sequence of
sub-exposures, we have compared the proﬁles of several spectral
lines recorded in the parallel beam with the retarder waveplate at

Figure 3. Using the expression from Gayley & Ignace (2012) for a recom-
bination wind emission line threaded by a split monopole magnetic ﬁeld,

ized wavelength x. The case shown is for an optically thick line with p = 6.

+45◦. The same was done for spectral lines recorded in the perpen-
dicular beam. The line proﬁles looked identical within the noise. In
Figs. 1 and 2, we show examples for the linear regression of the plot
V/I against −4.67 10−13λ2(1/I)(dI/dλ). The slope of the line ﬁtted
to the data directly translates into the value for hBzi. Fig. 1 shows
the results for the night of 2010 December 24, while Fig. 2 shows
the results for the night of 2012 January 5, both for the entire spec-
trum and excluding the He ii λ4686 line. The values determined for
the magnetic ﬁeld can be found in Table 4.

As a circularly polarized standard, we observed on two occa-
sions, on 2010 December 24 and 25, the strongly magnetic A0p star
HD 94660. HD 94660 has a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld that varies
about a mean value of ∼ −2 kG with an amplitude of a few hun-
dred Gauss over a period of 2800 d (Bailey et al. 2015). Both mea-
surements show a −2.3 kG ﬁeld, which is fully consistent with the
values for the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld at the considered rotation
phases expected from the variation curve deﬁned by Bailey et al.
(2015).

Noteworthy, we recently presented a detailed comparison
(Fossati et al. 2015) between our measurements and the indepen-
dent measurements of another group that uses reduction and anal-
ysis techniques developed strictly following Bagnulo et al. (2012).
The comparison showed results that agree well within a Gaussian
distribution. While not all 3σ detections can be considered as gen-
uine for single observations with FORS 2, they appear to be gen-
uine in a number of studies where the measurements show smooth
variations over a rotation period, similar to those found for the
magnetic Of?p stars HD 148937 and CPD −28◦ 2561 (Hubrig et al.
2008, 2011, 2013, 2015). In these studies, not a single reported de-
tection reached a 4σ signiﬁcance level.

Equation (2) is usually applied to stars with weak winds and
no rapid rotation. To qualitatively understand the application of this
equation to wind lines in the atmospheres of WR stars, we present
in Figs. 3 and 4 the schematic quality of equation (2) in winds,
following the model presented in Gayley & Ignace (2012). In these

scattering is produced when spherical symmetry is broken. Existing
observations revealed that the linear polarization is quite moderate,
but, of course, nothing is known about linear polarization for most
of the targets in our sample. We note that the linear polarization is
of immediate scientiﬁc interest itself, as the data can be interpreted
not only with respect to deviations from spherical symmetry, but
– if variable – also with respect to the temporal evolution of wind
structures.

The data reduction for observations of linear polarization was

Since FORS 2 is mounted in the UT 1 Cassegrain focus, its
spectropolarimetric calibration is relatively stable. Instrumental po-
larization measured using unpolarized standard stars is rather low,
less than 0.2%. Our observations of the spectropolarimetric stan-
dard NGC 2024-1 revealed the values PL = 9.58 ± 0.20% and
θP = 136.61 ± 0.42◦, which are in very good agreement with the
previous measurements PL = 9.65 ±0.12% and θP = 136.82 ±0.34◦
by Ignace et al. (2009).

3 RESULTS OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD

MEASUREMENTS

The results of our magnetic ﬁeld measurements using FORS 2 po-
larimetric spectra obtained in 2010, both for the entire spectrum
and for the measurements carried out excluding the strongest emis-
sion line belonging to He ii λ4686 are presented in Table 3, where
we also collect information on the modiﬁed Julian date, the SNR,
and the measurements obtained using the null spectra.

Trying to explain the huge rotational velocity of about
160 km s−1 at the stellar surface of BAT99 7, Shenar et al. (2014)
suggested the existence of a very strong photospheric magnetic
ﬁeld of up to 32 kG. The magnetic ﬁeld of this star was measured
on two consecutive nights in 2010, but no detection at a signiﬁcance
of 3σ was achieved in either measurement. The magnetic ﬁeld, if
present, would likely be variable. The highest value for the longitu-
dinal magnetic ﬁeld, hBzi−4686 = 327 ± 141 G at a signiﬁcance level
of 2.3σ, was measured on the ﬁrst night. On the second night, our
measurements result in the non-detection hBzi−4686 = 24 ± 124 G.

Figure 4. Following Fig. 3, we present a plot of (V/I)/ hbi against d ln I/dx
(blue points). The upper right quadrant is for points in the line proﬁle with
x < −1. The vertical distribution of points located at d ln I/dx corresponds
to the ﬂat-top portion of the line shape, for −1 < x < 0. The points in the
lower left quadrant are for redshifted wavelengths in the line, with x > 0.
The dashed green line is the expected relation for a static atmosphere.

ﬁgures, x is the line width in units of the radial Doppler shift at
the wind photosphere. p sets the power law for the radial falloﬀ of
the volume emissivity. We take p = 6 to simulate a majority-ion
density-squared emissivity in the acceleration zone of a wind with
v ∝ r. The hbi parameter gives the line-of-sight ﬁeld averaged over
the region in the wind that contributes to the proﬁle at x = 1 in the
uniformly expanding wind model with a split monopole ﬁeld. As
this is the region where much of the V signal originates, it provides
a reasonable meaning for the average detected ﬁeld. The unit of
hbi is the ﬁeld necessary to produce a Zeeman shift equal to the
Doppler shift of the radial velocity at the wind photosphere (i.e.,
the Doppler shift corresponding to x = 1).

From Fig. 3, we can see that the detailed shape of V/I is not
closely proportional to dlnI/dλ, owing to spatial variations in hBzi
in the detailed model used for those plots, but the overall magnitude
of the nonzero V/I is similar, especially for larger V/I that would
rise more signiﬁcantly above the noise. Moreover, there is no rea-
son to expect any correlation whenever the V/I is purely noise. Still,
one must accept signiﬁcant systematic uncertainties in the quantita-
tive meaning of an average longitudial magnetic ﬁeld in the absence
of a speciﬁc magnetic ﬁeld model, so the results quoted are not in-
tended to be directly compared to mean-ﬁeld upper limits acquired
via other means, at a level better than roughly a factor of 2. For
this reason, the conclusion by de la Chevroti´ere et al. (2013) that
the mean longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld is below about 100 G is not
necessarily in conﬂict with our results, as we see evidence of mag-
netic ﬁelds at the same level as their upper bound (see discussion
in Sect. 3).

Linear polarization observations in service mode were ob-
tained for eight angles of the retarder waveplate: 0.0◦, 22.5◦, 45.0◦,
67.5◦, 90.0◦, 112.5◦, 135.0◦, 157.5◦. During the visitor run in 2010,
only the ﬁrst four positions of the half-wave plate were used.

Certainly, future monitoring of the magnetic ﬁeld in this star will be
worthwhile, to see if there is a ﬁeld present that is undergoing mod-
ulation from rapid rotation, or if the observation is simply random
noise.

For WR 23, we measure on the ﬁrst night hBzi−4686 = −120 ±
48 G at a signiﬁcance level of 2.5σ and on the second night
hBzi−4686 = −80 ± 81 G. For the stars WR 18 and WR 7, magnetic
ﬁelds are measured at a signiﬁcance level of about 2σ and below.

Among the stars in our sample, only the star WR 6 was re-
ported to show the existence of structures called CIRs, which
are believed to be created by density contrasts owing to velocity
shear between fast and slow wind streaklines bent by rotation (e.g.
Cranmer & Owocki 1996). In some studies also magnetic spots
have been invoked as the likely cause of CIRs in hot-star winds.
However, previous attempts detected no such ﬁelds above several
100 G (e.g., Kholtygin et al. 2011; de la Chevroti´ere et al. 2013).

The magnetic ﬁeld with the highest signiﬁcance level in our
study, with hBzi−4686 = 258 ± 78 G, was detected in WR 6 dur-
ing our visitor run in 2010. A ﬁrst direct search for a magnetic
ﬁeld via the circular polarization of Zeeman splitting in this star
was recently carried out by de la Chevroti´ere et al. (2013) using
the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope. No magnetic ﬁeld was unambiguously detected by this
team. Assuming that the star is intrinsically magnetic and can be
described by a split monopole conﬁguration, the authors found an
upper limit on the order of 100 G for the strength of its magnetic
ﬁeld in the line-forming regions of the stellar wind.

The results of all magnetic ﬁeld measurements of WR 6 using
FORS 2 polarimetric spectra obtained in visitor and service mode,
both for the entire spectrum and for the measurements carried out
excluding the very strong emission line belonging to He ii λ4686
are presented in Table 4, where we also give information on the
modiﬁed Julian date, the rotation phase, and the measurements ob-
tained using null spectra. The phase of each observation was ob-
tained from the mid-times of exposure and the ephemeris given by
Lamontagne et al. (1986), based on long-term photometric moni-
toring (HJD = 2446153.61 + 3.766E). We note that the zero point
of the phase in our measurements is arbitrary since about 25 years
have passed between Lamontagne et al.’s latest data and those pre-
sented here for WR 6.

The measurements phased with this rotation period using the
entire spectrum including all available lines and excluding the He ii
λ4686 line, and the best sinusoidal ﬁts calculated for these mea-
surements, taking into account the already known rotation period
Prot = 3.766 d, are presented in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. In Fig. 7,

All quoted errors are 1σ uncertainties. The observation on the night of 2011
October 11 had very low SNR and could not be used for the measurement
of the magnetic ﬁeld.

we present the mean longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld measurements us-
ing the null spectra. As is shown in this ﬁgure, no similar variability
of the measured ﬁeld values using the null spectra is detected over
the rotation period. The distribution of the measured values appears
random and does not show any trend with the rotation phase.

The ﬁeld is reversing with the negative and positive ﬁeld ex-
trema appearing at the rotation phases around 0 and 0.5, respec-
tively. Only two measurements, namely those obtained at the rota-
tion phases of 0.560 and 0.643, reveal statistically signiﬁcant val-
ues of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld at a signiﬁcance level of 3.3σ
(hBzi−4686 = 258 ± 78 G) and 3.1σ (hBziall = 171 ± 56 G). A few
more measurements show a signiﬁcance level of about 2σ. The
presence of measurements at lower signiﬁcance levels in some ro-
tation phases is expected due to the sinusoidal character of the ﬁeld
behaviour with reversing polarities.

From the sinusoidal ﬁts to our data, we obtain for the mea-
surements using the entire spectrum a mean value for the variable
longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld hBzi = 44 ± 15 G and an amplitude of
the ﬁeld variation AhBazi = 69 ± 21 G. Using the entire spectrum
without the He ii λ4686 line, we obtain hBzi = 44 ± 17 G and
AhBaz i = 92 ± 24 G. For the best ﬁtting models superimposed on

magnetic ﬁeld measurements of WR 6 using the entire spectrum. The resid-
uals (observed – calculated) are shown in the lower panel. The deviations
are mostly of the same order as the error bars, and no systematic trends
are obvious, which justiﬁes a single sinusoid as a ﬁt function. The sinusoid
can be described by an oﬀset of hBzi = 44 ± 15 G and an amplitude of
AhBaz i = 69 ± 21 G.

the data presented in Figs. 5 and 6, we calculate a reduced χ2 of
0.83 and 0.84, respectively. In contrast, the reduced χ2 values cal-
culated assuming a model in which the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
is constant and equal to 0, is 1.56 for the measurements including
the He ii 4686 line and 1.92 for the measurements excluding the
He ii 4686 line. Noteworthy, we obtain χ2 = 0.44 for the zero-ﬁeld
model, if we use the hNzi values obtained using the null spectra.

From the observed sinusoidal modulation, we learn that the
magnetic ﬁeld structure shows two poles and a symmetry axis,
tilted with respect to the rotation axis. The simplest model for this
magnetic ﬁeld geometry is based on the assumption that the stud-
ied stars are oblique dipole rotators, i.e., their magnetic ﬁeld can
be approximated by a dipole with the magnetic axis inclined to the
rotation axis. Of course the strong wind would be expected to ex-
tensively modify any simple ﬁeld geometry, but the precision of the
data is insuﬃcient to explore the ﬁeld in detail.

The angle of obliquity of the magnetic axis β is constrained by

r =

hBzimin
hBzimax =

so that the obliquity angle β is given by

However, because of the dense winds in WR stars, for most of
them measuring the projected rotation velocity v sin i is not possi-
ble, i.e. the rotation axis inclination i remains undeﬁned. Using an

estimate of the stellar radius R = 2.65 R⊙ for WR 6 (Hamann et al.

35.6 km s−1. Since the limb-darkening is also unknown for WR
stars, we can only assume that Bd > 3 hBzimax resulting in a mini-
mum dipole strength of ∼300–400 G. We note that earlier marginal
detections in a few WR stars were determined in the framework of
a split monopole magnetic ﬁeld chosen because of its generic char-
acter in a dense, radial stellar wind (Gayley & Ignace 2010). On

the other hand, de la Chevroti´ere et al. (2014) suggest in their work
that the comparison between theoretical predictions and observa-
tions should be considered with care.

Based on the presented measurements, we suggest a lower
limit for the magnetic ﬁeld in the line-forming regions of the stellar
wind Bwind ∼ 300 G. Since diﬀerent emission lines form at diﬀer-
ent distances from the stellar surface and cover diﬀerent zones of
the wind, they sample diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths. Knowing roughly
the width of the lines, combined with the wind velocity-law in-
dex β, it is possible to approximate the surface ﬁeld strength, as-
suming 1/r2 scaling, where r = r(v). Following the considera-
tions on magnetic and line-emission zone parameters in WR 6 by
de la Chevroti´ere et al. (2013), we estimate that the surface value
of the magnetic ﬁeld is on the order of a few kiloGauss.

Interestingly, in spite of the rather low number of magnetic
ﬁeld measurements, the presence of rotation-modulated magnetic
variability is also indicated in our frequency periodograms pre-
sented in Fig. 8. The periodogram shown in the upper panel was
obtained for the measurements using the entire spectrum, while that
in the lower panel was obtained for the measurements carried out
excluding the He ii λ4486 line. A frequency analysis was performed
using a non-linear least squares ﬁt to the multiple harmonics utiliz-
ing the Levenberg-Marquardt method (Press et al. 1992) with the
optional possibility of prewhitening the trial harmonics. To detect
the most probable period, we calculated the frequency spectrum
and for each trial frequency we performed a statistical F-test of the

null hypothesis for the absence of periodicity (Seber 1977). The
resulting F-statistics can be thought of as the total sum including
covariances of the ratio of harmonic amplitudes to their standard
deviations, i.e. an SNR. The highest peak in the periodogram ob-
tained for the measurements using the entire spectrum is detected
at the frequency 0.30 1/d corresponding to a period of 3.33 d, while
the highest peak at the frequency 0.265 1/d corresponding to a pe-
riod of 3.77 d is identiﬁed in the periodogram obtained for the mea-
surements carried out excluding the He ii λ4486 line.

In the course of our study, we noted that variations detected in
emission line proﬁles probably correlate with the variation of the
magnetic ﬁeld. As an example, we present in Fig. 9 the variability
of the shape of the He ii λ5412 line proﬁle, which shows some kind
of double-peak structure in the phases close to the magnetic ﬁeld
extrema, i.e. close to the rotation phases 0 and 0.5. Although our
data are rather sparse, it is possible that wind structure variations
related to the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld may lead to the observed
changes in the shape of the spectral lines. However, the line proﬁle
recorded in 2010 at the phase 0.560 (i.e. 77 rotation cycles before
the start of our service observations), which is close to the time of
the maximum of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld, does not show this
structure. Such instable behaviour of the line proﬁles in the spectra
separated in time by several months or years was previously re-
ported in the study of Flores et al. (2011). Extensive sets of optical
spectroscopic observations spread over years have been obtained
in the past by several groups, mainly aimed at studies of the rela-
tionship between the level of continuum ﬂux emerging from the in-
ner stellar wind and the spectroscopic changes. Despite the epoch

4 MEASUREMENT ERROR VALIDATION WITH

SIMULATED DATA

An independent estimate of the error margin of our magnetic ﬁeld
measurements using circular polarization measurements of WR 6
can be obtained from the following test based on simulated data.
With the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code
(Gr¨afener et al. 2002; Hamann & Gr¨afener 2003), we calculated a
synthetic spectrum that is similar to the observed spectrum of this
star, presented in Fig. 15 in the work of Hamann et al. (2006).

The advantage of using synthetic models is that they are cre-
ated without noise and therefore one can add a predetermined
amount of noise according to the goodness of the data. At ﬁrst, we
take a normalized model spectrum and reduce the resolution to the
FORS 2 standard 2.4 Å FWHM and also bin the pixel size accord-
ing to the dispersion of 0.75 Å. Then, we add Gaussian distributed
noise with a speciﬁed SNR. We selected a SNR similar to the ob-
servation in the night of 2010 December 24. This procedure is done
twice so that one model spectrum with noise can be taken as right
circular polarized and the other as left circular polarized. Then the
data are analyzed for their Zeeman shift in the same way as the real
observations.

This has been done with a SNR of 970 and repeated for n =
10 000 times in order to get a normal distributed value of the null
ﬁeld from which it is possible to calculate the standard deviation.
This gives an estimate of the expected error for the measurement
of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld. The distribution of the measured
hBzi values is plotted as a histogram in Fig. 10. They scatter around
zero with a mean deviation of 28 G.

Summarizing, this test was based on the following assump-
tions: (1) the line spectrum is similar to our simulated, normalized
spectrum for WR 6; (2) the observed spectra have a S/N of 970
per pixel in the ordinary as well as in the extra-ordinary channel;
(3) statistical noise is the only source of errors; (4) all lines ex-
perience the same Zeeman splitting. Under these assumptions, the

value obtained for hBzi with FORS2 via our method of analysis has
a theoretical 1σ error of ∼ 28 G. Note that this error is independent
of the magnetic ﬁeld strength assumed in modeling the simulated
Stokes V spectrum (here hBzi = 0).

5 LINEAR POLARIZATION

5.1 Linear polarizations of BAT99 7, WR 7, WR 18, and

WR 23

Apart from the stars WR 6 and WR 18, no linear polarization ob-
servations are reported in the literature for BAT99 7, WR 7, and
WR 23. For WR 18, we found in the article of Schulte-Ladbeck
(1994) a note that the linear polarization spectrum of this star is fea-
tureless. Previous studies of linear polarization of WR 6 indicated
the presence of a “line eﬀect”, whereby the polarization across
strong lines is generally smaller than in neighboring regions of the
continuum (e.g., McLean et al. 1979; Schulte-Ladbeck et al. 1990,
1991; Harries et al. 1999).

In the upper part of Table 5, we present the results of the mea-
surements of linear polarization in the wavelength range between
4000 and 6100 Å for BAT99 7, WR 7, WR 18, and WR 23. For all
these stars, the polarization spectra are featureless, i.e. no evidence
of a line eﬀect was found. The WR star BAT99 7 is a WN4b type
star in the LMC, characterised by very round line proﬁles. As men-
tioned in the Introduction, such line proﬁles are believed to be ex-
plained by very rapid rotation that would lead to a deformation of
the star. A large deviation from a spherical shape is expected to
produce continuum polarization through scattering eﬀects and only
the line emission would be less scattered as it originates farther out
in the wind. Unfortunately, no line eﬀect is detectable in our linear
polarization measurements.

A few years ago, Chen´e & St-Louis (2011) undertook a search
for spectral variability in a large sample of WR stars, among
them the stars WR 7, WR 18, and WR 23. While WR 7 and WR 18
showed no detectable spectral variability, the star WR 23 was clas-
siﬁed as a star showing small-scale proﬁle variability.

In the observed WR stars, all measured polarization is the sum
of interstellar polarization (ISP) and intrinsic polarization. Usually,
for stars without a line eﬀect, the polarization properties of nearby
ﬁeld stars are used to estimate the ISP and its position angle. Im-
portantly, narrow-band optical surveys of the environments of WR
stars indicate the presence of nebulae around WR 7, WR 18, and
WR 23 (Marston 1997). As an example, we present in Fig. 11 an
image of the nebula NGC 2359 around the star WR 7, obtained dur-
ing the target acquisition with FORS 2. This image was obtained by
combination of the broad-band bhigh ﬁlter with the narrow-band S ii
and Hα ﬁlters. An interstellar gas shell was also observed in the
direction of the WR star WR 6, but presently it is not completely
clear whether there is a physical connection between this object and
the shell (Nichols & Fesen 1994). Due to the presence of nebulae
around our WR targets, we expect that ﬁeld stars in their vicinity do
not probe the same interstellar material and do not display the same
ISP. Therefore, no attempt has been made to correct the data for in-
terstellar polarization and the values presented in Table 5 cannot be
considered as intrinsic to these stars. On the other hand, three WR
stars were observed on two diﬀerent nights, so that our analysis
should allow us to detect the presence of variable polarization that
is intrinsic to the star. Taking into account the measurement accu-
racy, no spectropolarimetric variability is detected between the two
nights for any star. The star WR 23 shows the largest amount of

displaying the line eﬀect, it is possible to obtain a good measure of
the interstellar polarization. In order to estimate it, one needs to de-
termine the polarization of the line and the continuum. In Fig. 12,
we present as an example linear polarization spectra not corrected
for interstellar polarization. The continuum polarization of WR 6
was calculated using the vector sum of the Stokes parameters over
the entire spectrum, excluding regions containing obvious emis-
sion lines. The respective wavelength regions used are presented
in Table 6. This results in a vector pointing from the continuum
polarization to the line polarization and ﬁnally to the direction of
the interstellar polarization (see Fig. 13). Then, we assumed for
each observation a line that goes through the line polarization, the
continuum polarization and an initial interstellar polarization (ISP).
Through a least-squares minimization for each line and a mini-

mization of P χ2 via a downhill simplex technique, a best estimate

for (qi, ui) could be determined. We obtained qi = 0.56 ± 0.08
and ui = −0.24 ± 0.08, which gives P = 0.61 ± 0.08% and
θ = −11.60 ± 3.76◦. The interstellar polarization is wavelength
dependent and can be modelled by the empirical Serkowski law
(Serkowski 1973):

sured for BAT99 7.

5.2 Interstellar and intrinsic linear polarization of WR 6

Since all measured polarization is the sum of interstellar polariza-
tion and intrinsic polarization (whereby the line polarization is al-
ways a fraction of the continuum polarization), to determine the
interstellar polarization in WR 6, we followed the procedure de-
scribed in the work of Harries et al. (1999). In the stellar spectra

where Pmax is the maximum polarization occurring at a wave-
length λmax and k ∼ 1.15 is a shape parameter.

The results of the measurements of linear polarization in
the spectra of WR 6 are presented in the lower part of Ta-
ble 5, together with the corresponding phases. The linear po-
larization of the star WR 6 was already presented in numerous
studies (e.g., Schulte-Ladbeck et al. 1991; McLean et al. 1979;
Robert et al. 1992; Harries et al. 1999), and our measurements
show close agreement with previous results: we ﬁnd that the range
of the intrinsic continuum polarization is approximately 0.2–0.6%,
while the position angle of the polarization is strongly variable. We
noticed at the rotation phase 0.855 an apparent emission resulting
from the alignment of the continuum to the line polarization and
the ISP vector (e.g. Harries et al. 1999). We also noticed that at the
rotational phase 0.012 the vector from the continuum to the line
polarization signiﬁcantly diﬀers from all other measurements.

5.3 Modeling a corotating interaction region in WR 6

As mentioned above, WR 6 displays variability that cycles on a pe-
riod of 3.77 d. This period has generally been associated with ro-
tation, and the star is believed to host a CIR as suggested by UV,
optical studies, and X-rays (e.g., St-Louis et al. 1995; Morel et al.
1997; Ignace et al. 2013). The stable period of the star indicates
the presence of a clock in the system. However, the variability
can exhibit complex behavior, including rapid phase changes (e.g.,
Antokhin et al. 1994). If the period observed in WR 6 is associated
with rotation, then the observed variability is tied to an organized
structure threading the wind, such as CIRs. In terms of the period,
the linear polarization observations from this study span nearly 100
cycles, and variability in WR 6 is known to exhibit phase drift.
However, much of the data were obtained within two contiguous
cycles. We have attempted a rough ﬁt to this subset of the lin-
early polarized data using a CIR model as described in Ignace et al.
(2015).

Ignace et al. (2015) presented a kinematic description of a CIR
in terms of a spiral arm morphology in shape, and in terms of
a density contrast (either enhancement or deﬁcit) relative to the
otherwise unperturbed spherical wind. This is clearly a gross sim-
pliﬁcation as compared to more detailed numerical simulations of
CIR phenomena from massive star winds (e.g., Cranmer & Owocki
1996; Dessart 2004). Using this approach, Ignace et al. employ the
optically thin scattering results of Brown & McLean (1977) for ax-
isymmetric structures. The spiral morphology is not axisymmetric;
however, the structure is conceived in terms of a series of diﬀer-
ential pancake-shaped blobs, each one being slightly shifted in az-
imuth from the preceding, so that each segment of the spiral is ax-
isymmetric. Using an equation of motion for the spiral pattern, and
formulating a superposition for the net polarization properties from
the ensemble of spiral segment pieces, Ignace et al. were able to
evaluate a semi-analytic result for the polarization with rotational
phase. Moreover, an approach for combining multiple CIRs origi-
nating from arbitrary latitudes was presented.

Here only a heuristic application of the model is applied to the
dataset. The model allows for a number of free parameters, but in
the application to WR 6, the star and wind parameters are treated as
ﬁxed. The wind is optically thick to electron scattering, and the Ig-
nace et al. model applies only for thin scattering. For this situation
a core-halo model is adopted, whereby the polarization is evaluated
only where the electron optical depth τe < 1, assuming that light
from regions with τe > 1 will be completely depolarized.

The free parameters that remain in the model include: view-

and U (lower panel) in percent plotted against rotational phase. The points

clinations of i = 150◦ − 165◦.

ing inclination i (relative to the spin axis of the star), latitude ϑ at
which a CIR originates, opening angle β of the CIR structure, the
rotational phase oﬀset ϕ0 between the model and the observations,
an orientation phase ψ0 for how the projected spin axis is projected
on the sky relative to the observational system for evaluating Stokes
Q and U, and ﬁnally a density contrast factor η. Note ﬁrst that η is
deﬁned so that η = 0 is a spherical wind. Second, the factors β and
η are somewhat degenerate when the opening angle of the CIR is
not overly large: both aﬀect the amplitude of the polarization but
not the shape of its variation with rotational phase.

Although the model allows for multiple CIRs, our objective
was to determine whether a reasonable match between the data and
the model could be achieved with just one CIR structure. The re-
sults of our trial-and-error ﬁtting are shown in Fig. 14. The two
panels are for Q (upper panel) and U (lower panel) as percent po-
larization plotted against rotational phase.

Note that formal ﬁts between the data and the model are not
made (i.e., there is no χ2 evaluation). Also, the three red points in
Fig. 14 were not used in guiding the selection of the model parame-
ters. Of those three points, one is from a much older observation at
the phase 0.563, and thus from a much earlier epoch than the blue
points. The other two points that were not considered are the point
at rotation phase 0.855, where an apparent emission was resulting
from the alignment of the continuum to the line polarization and the
ISP vector, and the point at rotation phase 0.012, where the vector
from the continuum to the line polarization signiﬁcantly diﬀered
from all other measurements (see Sect. 5.2). However, as is shown
in Fig. 14, all three points do roughly follow the trend of the model
curves.

There is one notable discrepant point in the panel for Q, lo-
cated near phase 0.9 (surrounded by a dotted circle). No model with
a single arm can simultaneously account for that point along with
the other measurements. The discrepant point may suggest more
arms, or that a CIR (or CIRs) is not the only structure existing in
the ﬂow. We should expect a stochastic component to the structure.

The CIR might be disrupted at times, or perhaps an additional wind
structure can sometimes dominate the polarization.

In the selecting the model curves plotted in Figure 14, we ﬁrst
tried a single CIR located in the equatorial plane. Varying the re-
maining parameters, no satisfactory matches were achievable. Next
we varied both the latitude of the CIR and the viewing inclina-
tion of the star. A suite of model curves for viewing inclinations of
i = 150◦ − 165◦ are displayed in Fig. 14, which are seen to broadly
reproduce the pattern for the data (with the exception of one point
in Q near phase of 0.9). Relative to inclinations below 90◦, an incli-
nation exceeding 90◦ serves to ﬂip the sense of rotation as projected
onto the sky. For this range a fairly similar set of model curves re-
sulted for CIRs at latitudes of 40◦ and 45◦ as well as 135◦ and 140◦.
When i and ϑ are in opposite hemispheres, the spiral does sweep
across the front of the star for the observer’s sightline, but WR 6
is known to show regular DAC behavior (e.g. St-Louis et al. 1995).
Figure 14 thus shows the models for ϑ = 135◦ and 140◦.

This is the ﬁrst time that a model for polarization from a CIR
has been applied to data. Given that the model adopts a core-halo
approach, plus the complexity of the wind structure, the overall
ability of the model to match the majority of the data suggests that
a CIR is plausibly the source, or a signiﬁcant contributor, to the
variable linear polarimetry of WR 6. It is not our goal to claim a ﬁt
of high signiﬁcance, but simply to test the ability of the model for
achieving a rough match to the observed trend with (a) a single CIR
and (b) a limited number of free parameters. Given the simplistic
nature of the model, it is gratifying to ﬁnd that a modestly good ﬁt
to the majority of the measures can be achieved.

6 DISCUSSION

In this work, we address Wolf-Rayet type stars, where the magnetic
ﬁelds are especially hard to detect because of the wind-broadening
of their spectral lines. Moreover, all photospheric lines are absent
and the magnetic ﬁeld is measured on emission lines formed in the
strong wind.

It is the ﬁrst time that the low dispersion spectrograph FORS 2
in spectropolarimetric mode mounted at one of the biggest tele-
scopes in the world is used for spectropolarimetry of WR stars.
WR stars descend from initial masses above 20 M⊙ and during their
fast evolution, they already lost a signiﬁcant mass fraction via their
powerful stellar winds. Depending on their exact mass, rotation,
magnetism and mass-loss, in a few 105 yr, these stars will become
either neutron stars or black holes (e.g. Heger et al. 2003). A small
fraction of the WR star progenitors have strong magnetic ﬁelds on
the main sequence – the magnetic O-type stars. The observed tem-
poral variations of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁelds in these stars are
usually compatible with dipole ﬁelds inclined to the rotation axis,
implying a simple global structure. Obviously, the strength of the
average longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld in WR 6, varying with an am-
plitude of order only 100 G over the rotation cycle, is signiﬁcantly
lower than the ﬁeld strength detected in several magnetic O-type
stars. This is perhaps not surprising, given the fact that the magnetic
ﬁeld is diagnosed in the line-forming regions, which fall fairly far
out in a Wolf-Rayet wind, and not at the stellar surface. On the other
hand, a Wolf-Rayet star like WR 6 is signiﬁcantly contracted rela-
tive to its O-star progenitor, so the evolution of the ﬁeld between
these states requires further investigation. It would be worthwhile
to obtain in the future more dense rotation phase coverage by spec-
tropolarimetric observations to further strengthen the evidence for
the magnetic nature of this star. We should keep in mind that the

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–14

method we have applied involves substantial systematic uncertain-
ties, so only gives a rough result for the ﬁeld strength where lines
are formed, and that diﬀerent lines form over diﬀerent zones of the
wind, sampling diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths.

Magnetic ﬁelds for the other WR stars in our sample present
at a signiﬁcance level of about 2.5σ and below. Since up to now no
long-time spectropolarimetric monitoring was carried out for them
and we cannot neglect the possibility of unfavorable sampling of
the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration, the non-detection of the magnetic
ﬁeld does not mean that no magnetic ﬁeld is present in their at-
mospheres. Clearly, attaining higher SNR using FORS 2 in the fu-
ture will help to set more stringent limits to their magnetic ﬁeld
strengths.

For the ﬁrst time, we present linear polarization measurements
for BAT99 7, WR 7, WR 18, and WR 23. We do not ﬁnd any ev-
idence of a line eﬀect in these stars. Previous linear polarization
studies showed that most WR stars exhibit variable continuum po-
larization. However, no spectropolarimetric variability is detected
for BAT99 7, WR 7, and WR 23 over two nights. From the moni-
toring of the linear polarization of WR 6 over the rotation cycle, we
conﬁrm that the detected continuum polarization and the polariza-
tion position angle are not constant with time.
