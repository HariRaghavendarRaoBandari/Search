ABSTRACT

SDSS J163459.82+204936.0 is a local (z = 0.1293) infrared-luminous quasar with LIR = 1011.91L⊙. We
present a detailed multiwavelength study of both the host galaxy and the nucleus. The host galaxy, appearing as
an early type galaxy in the optical images and spectra, demonstrates violent, obscured star formation activities
with SFR ≈ 140M⊙yr- 1, estimated from either the PAH emission or IR luminosity. The optical to NIR spectra
exhibit a blueshifted narrow cuspy component in Hβ, He I λλ5876,10830 and other emission lines consistently
with an offset velocity of ≈ 900 km s- 1, as well as additional blueshifting phenomena in high-ionization lines
(e.g., a blueshifted broad component of He Iλ10830 and the bulk bluewhifting of [O III]λ5007), while there
exist blueshifted broad absorption lines (BALs) in Na I D and He Iλλ3889,10830, indicative of the AGN out-
ﬂows producing BALs and emission lines. Constrained mutually by the several BALs in the photoionization
simulations with Cloudy, the physical properties of the absorption-line outﬂow are derived as follows: den-
sity 104 < nH . 105 cm- 3, ionization parameter 10- 1.3 . U . 10- 0.7 and column density 1022.5 . NH . 1022.9
cm- 2, which are similar to those derived for the emission-line outﬂows. The similarity suggests a common
origin. Taking advantages of both the absorption lines and outﬂowing emission lines, we ﬁnd that the outﬂow
gas is located at a distance of ∼ 48 – 65 pc from the nucleus, and that the kinetic luminosity of the outﬂow is
1044–1046 erg s- 1. J1634+2049 has a off-centered galactic ring on the scale of ∼ 30 kpc that is proved to be
formed by a recent head-on collision by a nearby galaxy for which we spectroscopically measure the redshift.
Thus this quasar is a valuable object in the transitional phase emerging out of dust enshrouding as depicted by
the co-evolution scenario invoking galaxy merger (or violent interaction) and quasar feedback. Its proximity
enables our further observational investigations in detail (or tests) of the co-evolution paradigm.

1. INTRODUCTION

In the generally believed cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm
of the universe, galaxies grow in a “bottom-up” fashion as
led by the CDM halos, with smaller ones forming ﬁrst and
then merging into successively larger ones. Mergers and
strong interactions of gas-rich galaxies are also believed to
play a vital role in triggering the accretion activity, namely
the active galactic nucleus (AGN) phenomenon, of super-
massive black holes (SMBHs) that reside at the centers of
most (if not all) galaxies (see, e.g., Hopkins et al. 2006). Ob-
servationally, the ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs;
LIR ≥ 1012L⊙) in the local Universe discovered three decades
ago are found mostly in mergers, which inspired a merger-
driven, evolutionary sequence from ULIRGs to quasars and
ﬁnally to present-day elliptical galaxies (Sanders et al. 1988;

Sanders & Mirabel 1996; Hopkins et al. 2006, 2008). At ﬁrst,
galaxy merging induces enormous starbursts, which are al-
most completely enshrouded by dust (i.e., in the ULIRG
phase), and triggers the central AGN; with the increasing
feedback from the starbursts and AGN, the cold gas and dust
are heated up and even expelled out of the galaxy, and thus
the AGN becomes optically bright (i.e., the quasar phase),
and meanwhile the large-scale starbursts decline; ﬁnally the
cold gas and dust is gone, the AGN shuts down and the
galaxy becomes an old elliptical. This scenario has been
supported by subsequent observations and N-body/SPH sim-
ulations (Hopkins et al. 2006). Particularly, the tight corre-
lation between the masses of SMBHs and the properties of
the spheroids observed in local quiescent galaxies suggests a
co-evolution of galaxies with SMBHs (see Kormendy & Ho
2013 for a review).

In practice, however, the concrete triggering and feedback
processes underlying this scenario remain unknown over last
decades. This leaves many open questions, e.g., what the tim-
ing is between starburst and AGN activities, how the AGN
feedback operates in the host galaxy. The physical processes
actually cannot be learnt from statistical studies alone (e.g.,
correlation analysis) of galaxy and quasar samples and are
also beyond the capabilities of current simulations (see, e.g.,
Hopkins et al. 2006; Veilleux et al. 2009). A straightforward
way is to carry out complementary investigations of individ-
ual sources in detail, particularly of the rare cases in transi-
tional phases of the proposed evolutionary sequence.
This paper presents a detailed multiwavelength analysis of
SDSS J163459.82+204936.0 (hereafter J1634+2049), a type-

2

W.-J. Liu et al.

1 AGN at z = 0.1293 with outﬂows revealed in both broad ab-
sorption lines (BALs) and narrow emission lines. This object
was detected by Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and
was compiled by Condon et al. (1995) into their catalog of
radio-detected bright IRAS sources. J1634+2049 was noted
by us from the SDSS spectral data set when we compiled
the sample of low-z quasars with broad He Iλ3889 absorp-
tion troughs (Liu et al. 2015). In the present paper, we will
see that J1634+2049 is a LIRG with a total infrared luminos-
ity of 1011.91 L⊙, suggesting a strong on-going star formation
(SFR ∼ 140 M⊙ yr- 1) . Both star formation regions and
the AGN show considerable internal dust obscuration. The
spectroscopy observation on the nearby galaxy demonstrates
that J1634+2049 was collided through by a galaxy, leaving a
stellar ring around it on scales of 30 kpc (§3.3). Besides the
outﬂow revealed in BALs of He I* and Na I D(§2.4.3), there
are outﬂows revealed in the emission of the narrow Hydro-
gen Balmer and Paschen lines, [O II], [O III]λ5007, He Iλ5876
and λ10830 (§2.4.2). Analyses with model calculations in-
dicate that the physical conditions of the absorption-line out-
ﬂow and emission-line outﬂow are similar, suggesting that the
two are intrinsically the same outﬂow. The outﬂow is esti-
mated to be ∼ 48–65 pc away from the central nuclei with a
large kinetic luminosity ∼ 1044 erg s- 1 (see §3.4). In terms
of the mid-infrared (MIR) – far-infrared (FIR) spectral en-
ergy distribution (SED) (see §2.2), J1634+2049 is between
the prototypal ULIRG/quasar composite object Mrk 231 (see
e.g., Kawakatu et al. 2006; Veilleux et al. 2013; Spoon et al.
2013; Leighly et al. 2014) and normal quasars. Mrk 231 has
been known for long as the nearest ULIRG/QSO compos-
ite object, with a total infrared luminosity of 3.6 × 1012L⊙,
AGN bolometric luminosity of 1.5 × 1046 erg s- 1 and a star
formation rate of 170 M⊙yr- 1 (Veilleux et al. 2013). It is a
FeLoBAL quasar and displays neutral and ionized nuclear
outﬂows in several optical and UV tracers (e.g., Veilleux et al.
2013; Leighly et al. 2014); recently Mrk 231 has been re-
garded as the archetype showing galactic-scale quasar-driven
winds. J1634+2049 should be a young, transitional quasar im-
mediately after Mrk 231 in the evolutionary sequence, blow-
ing out of the enshrouded dust after a violent galactic col-
lision. Throughout this work we assume a cosmology with
H0 = 70 km s- 1 Mpc- 1, Ωm = 0.3, and ΩΛ = 0.7.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS

2.1. Spectroscopic and photometric Observations

J1634+2049 has been observed in multiple bands both spec-
troscopically and photometrically.
It was ﬁrst spectroscop-
ically observed by SDSS on 2004 August 7th UT with an
exposure time of 3072 s under the seeing of ∼ 1′′.3, with a
wavelength coverage of 3800–9200 Å. The SDSS pipeline
gave a redshift of 0.1286±0.0014. We measure a redshift
zem = 0.1293 ± 0.0007 from [S II]λλ6716,6731, and all the
following rest-frame spectra are referred to this redshift.

Trying to extend the optical spectrum towards both the
near-ultraviolet and near-infrared ends, we have taken spec-
troscopy with the Double Spectrograph (DBSP) on the Palo-
mar 5-m Hale telescope (Oke & Gunn 1982). Two exposures
of 300s each were obtained on 2014 April 23th UT, when the
sky is basically clear and the seeing was ∼ 1′′.5. With a 1′′.5
slit-width and the 600/4000 grating the blue-side (3150–5700
Å) spectrum has a spectral resolution of ∼ 4.13 Å; with a
1′′.5 slit-width and the 600/10000 grating, the red-side (7800–

10200 Å) spectrum has a spectral resolution of ∼ 4.2 Å. The
data reduction was performed with the standard routines in
the IRAF8 .
In addition, there are two small nearby galaxies seen to the
west of J1634+2049 in the SDSS image (C1, C2 in Figure
2). The two galaxies show similar colors to J1634+2049,
and their photometric redshift values given by SDSS are
0.224±0.0421 and 0.283±0.0781 respectively, close to that
of J1634+2049 in light of the large uncertainties of the pho-
tometric redshifts. Considering the galactic ring around
J1634+2049, we wonder if the two nearby galaxies have been
once interacting with J1634+2049. To measure the redshifts
of two possible physically companion galaxies, we performed
spectroscopy observations of J1634+2049 and the two nearby
galaxies using the Yunnan Faint Object Spectrograph and
Camera (YFOSC) mounted on the Lijiang GMG 2.4m tele-
scope on 2015 March 13. The G10 (150 mm- 1) grating pro-
vides a wavelength range of 3400–10000 Å and a resolution
of R ≈ 760. The 1.′′8 slit-width was adopted, and the slit
was rotated by a position angle PA = 86◦, in order to place
J1634+2049 and C1 and C2 (see Figure 9) all in the slit. Two
exposures of 2400 s each were obtained. The data reduction
was performed with the standard IRAF routines. Due to the
low spectral resolution and the imperfect HeNeAr lamp spec-
tra, IRAF gives a quite large uncertainty of the wavelength
calibration, 2.84Å (rms).

The near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations for this
object were performed with the TripleSpec spectrograph on
the Palomar 5-m Hale telescope on 2012 April 15th. Four ex-
posures of 120 s each were obtained in an A-B-B-A dithering
mode, and the sky is clear with seeing ∼ 1′′.2. The slit-width
of TripleSpec was ﬁxed to 1′′. Two telluric standard stars were
taken quasi-simultaneously. The data was reduced with the
IDL program SpexTool (Cushing et al. 2004). The ﬂux cali-
bration and telluric correction were performed with the IDL
program using the methods described in Vacca et al. (2003).
MIR Observation of J1634+2049 was performed using
the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS; Houck et al. 2004) on board
Spitzer (Werner et al. 2004) on April 30th, 2008 (PI: Lei Hao,
program ID: 40991). All four modes, short low 1 (SL1),
short low 2 (SL2), long low 1 (LL1), and long low 2 (LL2)
were used, to obtain full 5–35 µm low-resolution (R ∼ 100)
spectra. We obtain the reduced spectrum from the public
archive “Cornell Atlas of Spitzer/IRS Sources”9 (CASSIS v7;
Lebouteiller et al. 2011).
J1634+2049 has been photometrically observed in multiple
bands, and we list all the available photometric data in Ta-
ble 1.

2.2. Broad-band Spectral Energy Distribution

As shown in Figure 1, we construct the broad-band SED
in restframe wavelength using the photometric data and spec-
tra in multiple bands. These data are corrected for Galactic
extinction using the dust map of Schlegel et al. (1998) and
the Fitzpatrick (1999) reddening curve. Because these photo-
metric and spectroscopic observations are non-simultaneous,

8 IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories,
which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in As-
tronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foun-
dation.

we ﬁrst check the variability of this object before we analyze
the broad-band SED. The Catalina Sky Survey10 performs
an extensive photometric monitor since 2005 April 9th (MJD
from 53469 to 56590), and have 272 observations so far. We
obtain these data from the Catalina Surveys Data Release 2
(CSDR2), and bin the data within every day. As the bottom
panel of Figure 1 shows, J1634+2049 have a long-term opti-
cal variability within 0.2 mag in the V band. Such a variability
amplitude does not impact our discussions on its SED and so
on below.
The top panel of Figure 1 shows the broad band SED of
J1634+2049. The average QSO spectrum from the UV to FIR
band scaled at 2µm is over-plotted for comparison. This av-
erage QSO spectrum is combined from the UV to optical av-
erage QSO spectrum of Vanden Berk et al. (2001), the NIR
average QSO spectrum of Glikman et al. (2006) and the FIR
average QSO spectrum of Netzer et al. (2007). It is obvious
that the observed SED of J1634+2049 shows a very different
shape from the average QSO spectrum.
In the UV, optical
and NIR J and H bands, J1634+2049 is much lower than the
average QSO spectrum; from the K band up to the MIR (5–
30 µm), the shape of the SED is similar to that of the average
QSO spectrum; in the FIR band, J1634+2049 shows an obvi-
ous excess, 10 times higher than the luminosity of the average
SED of QSOs at 60µm.

Note that in Figure 1 the AKARI photometric ﬂux densi-
ties are systematically lower than the IRAS ones, which is
actually because the AKARI data at 65µm and 140µm are
not reliable. For the AKARI data, the quality ﬂags at 65µm,
90µm and 140µm are ‘1’, ‘3’ and ‘1’, respectively, where ‘3’
indicative of the highest data quality and ‘1’ indicating that
the source is not conﬁrmed. For the IRAS data, the quality
ﬂags of the ﬂux densities at 12µm, 25µm, 60µm and 100µm
are ‘1’, ‘3’, ‘3’ and ‘2’, respectively, where ‘3’ means the
highest data quality and ‘1’ means that the ﬂux is only an up-
per limit. Thus, the IRAS ﬂux densities at 25µm, 60µm and
the AKARI ﬂux density at 90µm are the most reliable; the
IRAS ﬂux density at 100µm is the 2nd most reliable with a
quality ﬂag of ‘2’, and it is consistent with the AKARI ﬂux
densities at 90µm within 1-σ. The IRAS 12µm ﬂux density is
higher than the WISE W3 (12µm), which is because the IRAS
12µm datum is just an upper limit (with a IRAS quality ﬂag
of ‘1’). Besides, the ﬂux density of the IRAS 25µm is consis-
tent with those of the WISE W4 and SPITZER/IRS 22µm; the
ﬂux densities of WISE W3 (12µm) and W4 (22µm) are con-
sistent with those of SPITZER/IRAC 8µm, SPITZER/IRAC
16µm and SPITZER/IRS 22µm.

We try to match its SED to the reddened versions of the
average QSO spectrum with different extinction curves. In
Figure 1, the blue dashed line indicates the average QSO spec-
trum reddened with Milky Way extinction curve (Fitzpatrick
1999) by EB- V = 0.64, while the purple and green dashed lines
show the reddening with SMC extinction curve (Pei 1992)
by EB- V = 0.61 and the LMC extinction curve (Misselt et al.
1999) by EB- V = 0.66, respectively. Here, the RV for the Milky
Way extinction curve is 3.1, and for the LMC extinction curve
is 2.6 (Weingartner & Draine 2001). It is hard to distinguish
the extinction types according to the optical and NIR spectra,

The
Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) is funded by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration under Grant No. NNG05GF22G issued through the Science
Mission Directorate Near-Earth Objects Observations Program. The CRTS
survey is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under grants
AST-0909182.

since these reddened average QSO spectra show little differ-
ence in the optical and NIR bands. But, considering also the
NUV and FUV photometric data retrieved from the GALEX
archive (albeit not as superior as a UV spectrum), the LMC
extinction curve is favored (see Figure 1). Hereafter, we will
employ the LMC extinction curve with RV = 2.6 for the inter-
nal dust obscuration of J1634+2049.

The IR luminosity (8–1000 µm) is calculated based on
the IRAS photometric ﬂuxes following Sanders & Mirabel
(1996). Because the IRAS 12µm ﬂux density is an upper
limit, in the calculation we use the WISE datum in the W3
band (12µm) instead.
It gives logLIR(L⊙) = 11.91 ± 0.03,
which is very closed to the deﬁning IR luminosity of ULIRGs.
As Schweitzer et al. (2006) suggested, for typical QSOs (e.g.,
PG QSOs), most of the far-infrared luminosity is originated
from star formation. If this is the case for J1634+2049, fol-
lowing the relation SFR(M⊙yr- 1) = 4.5 × 10- 44LIR (erg s- 1)
(Kennicutt 1998), the star formation rate (SFR) is estimated
to be SFR = 140 ± 43M⊙ yr- 1. The scatter of this equation
is ± 30% (Kennicutt 1998), which is dominated the statisti-
cal uncertainty of the SFR. From the PAH emission lines and
24µm continuum, the SFR are estimated to be 141M⊙ yr- 1
and 143M⊙ yr- 1 respectively, which are well consistent with
the SFR estimated from its IR luminosity.
The k- corrected radio power at 1.4GHz for J1634+2049 is
also estimated, P1.4GHz = 9.14 × 1023 W Hz- 1. This is calcu-
L fint/(1 + z)1+αr, where the radio spec-
lated by P1.4GHz = 4πD2
tral index αr (Fν ∝ ναr) is assumed to be - 0.5.
We compare the SED of J1634+2049 with that of Mrk 231,
which is a prototypal, nearest ULIRG/quasar composite ob-
ject. The SED of Mrk 231 is constructed from the multi-
band spectra we collected. The FUV (1150–1450Å) spec-
trum is obtained with Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS)
G130M grating on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
The UV spectrum within (1600–3200Å) is obtained with
Faint Ob ject Spectrograph (FOS) G190 and G270 gratings
on board HST. All the HST spectra are retrieved from HST
data archive11. The optical spectrum (3750–7950 Å) is ob-
tained from Kim et al. (1995). We also observed Mrk 231
using TripleSpec spectrograph on Hale telescope on 2013
February 23th to obtain its NIR spectra. The FIR spectrum is
obtained from Brauher et al. (2008). These multibands spec-
tra are corrected for the Galactic extinction, and combined to-
gether by matching to its photometry data. In Figure 1 we
scale the SED of Mrk 231 at 2µm to that of J1634+2049.
As Figure 1 demonstrates, the shapes of the two SEDs differ
signiﬁcantly. Mrk 231 appears more reddened in the NUV–
optical continuum. More strikingly, Mrk 231 has a much
larger excess in MIR and FIR bands with a deeper silicate
absorption dip at 9.7µm than J1634+2049.

2.3. Analysis of SDSS Images

J1634+2049 was photometrically observed by SDSS in the
u,g,r,i,z bands on 2003 June 23 UT, with an exposure time of
54 s per ﬁlter in drift-scan mode (Gunn et al. 1998). A bright
point-like source appears at the center of its images and the
whole galaxy is almost round in shape and has no spiral arms,
indicating an elliptical/spheroidal or a face-on S0 galaxy.
Closer inspection reveals a low surface-brightness (SB) yet
visible, circum-galactic ring-like structure. Although the stan-
dard SDSS images have a relatively short exposure time and

W.-J. Liu et al.

low spatial resolution due to the seeing limit, they are still
very useful for global study. The drift-scan mode, yielding
accurate ﬂat-ﬁelding, in combination with the large ﬁeld of
view (FoV) ensures very good measurement of the sky back-
ground, and thus the azimuthally averaged, radial SB proﬁle
can be reliably determined down to µr ≈ 27 mag arcsec- 2
(e.g., Pohlen & Trujillo 2006; Erwin et al. 2008; Jiang et al.
2013). We try to perform a two-dimensional (2D) decom-
position of the AGN and host galaxy of J1634+2049 using
GALFIT (Peng et al. 2002, 2010). An accurate decomposi-
tion can not only help us understand its host galaxy but also
put an independent constraint on the SED of the AGN, which
is helpful for spectral ﬁtting (cf. Jiang et al. 2013). Taking
advantage of the large FoV, a bright yet unsaturated nearby
star (SDSSJ163503.44+204700.3) is selected as the PSF im-
age, whose precision is essentially important to separate the
AGN from the host. The host galaxy is represented by a
Sérsic (1968) r1/n function. During the ﬁtting, the sky back-
ground is set to be free; the outer ring region, enclosed by
the green polygon as in Figure 2, is masked out; all other
photometric objects in the ﬁeld identiﬁed either by Sextractor
(Bertin & Arnouts 1996) or by the SDSS photometric pipeline
are also masked out.
We begin the ﬁtting with a free PSF + Sérsic scheme al-
lowing all parameters to vary, which yields an unreasonable
high value of Sérsic index (n > 10). Then we thus try to ﬁxed
n to 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively (see Jiang et al. 2013). Ex-
cept for the u-band image, which is totally dominated by the
AGN component, all other four bands yield well consistent
results: the best-ﬁt Sérsic component is with n = 4. We have
also attempted to add an exponential disk component, yet no
convergent result can be achieved. The ﬁtting results in the
g, r, and i bands are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
To illustrate the AGN and host galaxy contribution at differ-
ent radii, shown in Figure 3 are the corresponding radial SB
proﬁles of the best-ﬁt components of the r-band image.

As we know, the SDSS spectrum is extracted through a ﬁber
aperture of 3′′ in diameter. To further assess the AGN and host
galaxy ﬂuxes in the ﬁber aperture, we have also integrated the
ﬂuxes within the aperture from the model images of the AGN
and Sérsic components, respectively, which are also listed in
Table 2.

2.4. Analysis of the Optical-NIR Spectrum

2.4.1. Decomposition of the continuum

Before we perform the analysis on its spectra from dif-
ferent telescopes/instruments, we ﬁrst check the aperture ef-
fect, as J1634+2049 is an extended galaxy. Although the
SDSS, DBSP and NIR spectra are observed with different
apertures/slits, we ﬁnd that the three spectra, which were cal-
ibrated independently, are well consistent in ﬂux level; espe-
cially, DBSP and SDSS spectra are almost the same in their
overlap part. On the other hand, as Figure 3 demonstrates,
the surface brightness of J1634+2049 decreases rapidly in
r >1′′, and therefore the outer region (r >1′′.5) has a negli-
gible contribution to these spectra. Besides, considering the
above fact that the SDSS and DBSP spectra are almost the
same, although the three spectra were observed in different
time (SDSS: MJD 53224, NIR: MJD 56034, DBSP: MJD
56771), the variability effect can be ignored.

Figure 4 shows the spectrum combined from the DBSP,
SDSS and NIR spectra,
the overlap parts of which are
weighted by spectral S/N. First of all, we take a global

overview of the features of the AGN and starlight compo-
nents.
In §2.3 the 2D imaging decomposition by GALFIT
gives the contributions of the two components. Within the
3′′-diameter aperture, the PSF (AGN) component accounts
for 59% of the g-band light, 44% in the r, 44% in the i,
and 67% in the z, respectively. The u band image is much
less sensitive, so an accurate decomposition is difﬁcult; our
rough decomposition shows that it is totally dominated by
a PSF component. According to the 2D-decomposition, the
colors (g - r, r -
i) of the Sérsic component are (0.93, 0.5),
which suggest that the age of the dominating stellar compo-
nent could be older than 10 Gyr (Bruzual & Charlot 2003).
Now looking at the combined spectrum, the typical AGN fea-
tures such as strong broad emission lines and blueshifted ab-
sorption lines are signiﬁcant; in contrast, the starlight com-
ponent is almost lost of any features, except for the appear-
ance of weak Ca II H & K and Na I D absorption lines. On
the other hand, the high FIR luminosity betrays recent violent
star-formation activities (see §2.2), suggestive of the presence
of a (obscured) young stellar population. Meanwhile, both the
large extinction in the UV and the large Balmer decrement
of narrow hydrogen emission lines (see §2.4.2 and Table 4)
suggest the star-formation region is enshrouded by thick dust.
Here we can roughly estimate the lower limit to the extinction
for the young stellar population that ionizes the H II region
and powers the nebular emission lines and FIR dust emission.
Using the SFR estimated from PAH(see §2.5) and the rela-
tion SFR(M⊙yr- 1) = 7.9 × 10- 42L(Hα) (erg s- 1) (Kennicutt
1998), we get the predicted luminosity of Hα for the HII re-
gion, 1.78 × 1043 erg s- 1. Yet the observed luminosity of the
narrow Hα line L(narrowHα) is only 1.88 × 1041 erg s- 1. As-
suming all the emission of the narrow Hα component is from
star formation, then the extinction for narrow Hα emission
line is AHα = 4.9; applying the LMC extinction curve, the
EB- V of the young stellar population is thus ∼2.6.
In ad-
dition, the excess emission between ∼ 2 and 10 µm, which
appears in this spectrum, has been widely regarded to be orig-
inated from the hot dust of ∼ 1500 K in the studies of AGN
SEDs (Rieke 1978; Edelson & Malkan 1986; Barvainis 1987;
Elvis et al. 1994; Glikman et al. 2006).

Based on the above analysis, we can decompose the contin-
uum (3000–22000 Å in restframe wavelength) with the fol-
lowing model:

Fλ = Cnucleus Anucleus(Enucleus

Chost,1 SSP(> 2Gyr) + Chost,2 Ahost(Ehost

B- V , λ) λα + CbbBλ(Tdust) +
B- V, λ) SSP(6 1Gyr) ,

(1)

B- V

where Fλ is the observed spectrum in the rest frame, Cnucleus,
Chost,1, Chost,2, Cbb are the factors for the respective compo-
nents, Anucleus and Ahost are the dust extinction to the AGN
emission and to the young stellar population, respectively, and
Bλ(Tdust) is the Planck function. As α (the intrinsic AGN con-
tinuum slope) and Enucleus
are somehow degenerate, in the ﬁt-
ting α is ﬁxed to - 1.7 while Enucleus
is free, which is the com-
mon recipe for reddened AGN continua in the literature (see,
e.g., Dong et al. 2005, 2012, and Zhou et al. 2006). The two
stellar populations are modeled by two simple stellar popula-
tion (SSP) templates from Bruzual & Charlot (2003), with the
metallicity being ﬁxed to the solar (Z = 0.02) for simplicity. A
SSP is deﬁned as a stellar population whose star formation du-
ration is short compared with the lifetime of its most massive
stars. Based on the analysis in the preceding paragraph, we
select 30 SSP templates with ages between 50 Myr and 1 Gyr
to model the young stellar component, and 28 SSP templates

with ages between 5 Gyr and 12 Gyr to model the old stel-
lar component. We traverse every possible SSP templates in
the library during the ﬁtting, and use the IDL routine MPFIT
(Markwardt 2009) to do the job with Cnucleus, Chost,1, Chost,2,
Cbb, Enucleus
B- V and Tdust being free parameters. Detailedly,
as the average QSO spectrum reddened with LMC extinction
curve by EB- V = 0.66 ﬁts this object well (see Figure 1), the
Enucleus
is initially set to be 0.66, and allowed to vary freely
within 0.3–0.8 according to the Balmer decrement measured
from the broad-line Hα/Hβ; The Ehost
B- V is initially set to be
2.6, varying within 1.0–3.0 according to the Balmer decre-
ment measured from the narrow-line Hα/Hβ (see Table 4).
We also set the fraction of the power law component in the
r band to be 0.5 initially, and allow the value varying within
0.4–0.6.

The ﬁtting converges on the two SSP templates with ages of
127 Myr and 9 Gyr respectively, Enucleus
B- V of 2.2,
and Tdust =1394 K that is close to the result of Glikman et al.
(2006). As Figure 4 shows, the fractions of the decomposed
nucleus and starlight components in the spectrum are basi-
cally consistent with the imaging decomposition. The black-
body continuum from the hot dust of the presumable torus
should be the dominant emission in the K band and the WISE
W1 band. To check it, we extend the ﬁtting result to the WISE
W1 band, and ﬁnd that it can well reproduce the observed data
point. As to the best-ﬁt starlight spectrum composed of the
two SSP components, it reproduces well the Ca II H & K and
Hδ absorption lines, yet over-estimates the Na I D absorption.
This discrepancy may be due to the uncertainty of the decom-
position, or more probably the contamination to the Na I D
absorption by the nearby He Iλ5876 emission line.

The concern on the decomposition is mainly about the de-
composition of the two stellar components. To assess the reli-
ability of the decomposed stellar components (mainly of their
ages), we do the following checks. First of all, regardless of
the above physical arguments to justify the use of two SSPs,
we test this point with the data (lest the spectral quality should
not be sufﬁcient to support it). Using a single SSP with the
metallicity and age being free parameters for the starlight in
the model, we obtain the best ﬁt with a much larger minimum
χ2. The reduced χ2 increases by ∆χ2
ν = 2.5, and the two-SSP
model is favored according to F- test (the chance probability
Pnull = 0). Then, we check the algorithm of MPFIT for global
minimum, as follows. (1) We loop over the grid of the 28 tem-
plates for the old stellar population component, and for every
case of the assigned template for the old component we get
the best-ﬁt young stellar component according to minimum
χ2; these 28 best-ﬁt young populations have ages in the range
of 80–210 Myr. (2) On the other hand, we loop over the grid
of the 30 templates for the young stellar population compo-
nent, and for every case we get the best-ﬁt old component by
χ2 minimization; these 30 best-ﬁt old stellar populations have
ages in the range of 8–11 Gyr. We can see that, at least, the
ages of the two components can be well separated. (3) Fur-
thermore, considering that the Ca II H & K and Hδ absorption
lines are dominated by the old stellar component, we devise
instead a χ2
abs as calculated in the spectral region of 3900–
4050Å in order to better constrain the ﬁtting of the old stellar
component. We repeat the procedure of (2) yet with minimiz-
ing χ2
abs. For every case of the held template for the young
component, the best-ﬁt SSP template for the old component
may be different from (2). Yet the ages of the best-ﬁt old com-

ponents of all the 30 cases are still in the range of 8–11 Gyr.
Certainly, we should note that the above checks do not ac-
count for the effect of the internal dust extinction parameters
(see Eq. 1), which should impact the ﬁtting of the two stellar
components.

Since for any a SSP the age and metallicity are degener-
ate parameters, we also try to model the starlight with two
SSPs with their age and metallicity set to be free (allowing
Z = 0.0001, 0.0004, 0.004, 0.008, 0.02 and 0.05). This test
scheme yields that the best-ﬁt two SSPs have ages of 47.5 Myr
and 12 Gyr, and both converge to an extremely low metallic-
ity Z = 0.0004. Such a metallicity is even lower than that of
most of the most metal-poor (dwarf) galaxies, which is unre-
alistic for J1634+2049 with a mass/size similar to the Milky
Way. Besides, this scheme does not change much the best-
ﬁt starlight (the sum of the two stellar populations): the dif-
ference of the starlight between this scheme and the solar-
metallicity scheme we adopt is 14% in the Hβ—[O III] re-
gion, and only 2% in the K band; the best-ﬁts of the other
components (the reddened AGN continuum and the hot dust
emission) change negligibly also. In this present work, we use
K-band luminosities to derive stellar masses (see Sections 3.1
and 3.2), and do not use stellar age and metallicity to achieve
any conclusions. Thus, it is safe to assume the solar metallic-
ity for the two SSPs in the model.

2.4.2. Emission lines

As

the Figure 4 shows,

strong emission lines of
J1634+2049 display intensively in four spectral regions:
Hβ + [O III]λλ4959,5007 + Fe II multiplets, Hα +
[N II]λλ6548,6583 + [S II]λλ6716,6731, Pγ + He Iλ10830
and Pα (note that the Pβ and Pδ emission lines are of low
S/N).

Before we ﬁt the four regions, we ﬁrst take a look at the
proﬁles of the various emission lines. Figure 5 shows Pα, Pγ,
He Iλ10830, Hα, He Iλ5876, [O III]λ5007, Hβ, Ne IIIλ3869
and [O III]λ3727 emission lines in the common velocity space.
We note the following major points. (1) The total proﬁles of
the recombination lines (such as Pα, Pγ, He Iλ10830, Hα,
He Iλ5876 and Hβ) apparently exhibit a narrow peaked com-
ponent and a lower and broad base; the two components ap-
pears separable from each other. (2) Besides, probably of the
most interesting, in Hβ and He Iλλ5876,10830, there clearly
exists an extra cuspy narrow component that is blueshifted
by a velocity of ∼ 900 km s- 1; the blueshift velocity is con-
sistent in the three lines.
(3) The whole proﬁle of high-
ionization narrow forbidden emission lines, [O III]λ5007 and
Ne IIIλ3869, is blueshifted evidently, with an offset velocity of
≈500 km s- 1 according to the peak of [O III]λ5007; this kind
of bulk blueshifting seems to be present in the low-ionization
forbidden line [O II]λ3727, yet with a smaller blueshift.

We start the line-proﬁle ﬁttings with the Pα emission line,
which is the strongest of the hydrogen Paschen series, and
basically free of blending (unlike He I λ10830).
Its proﬁle
can be used as a template to ﬁt the Pγ + He Iλ10830 blends
(Landt et al. 2008). The high contrast between the narrow
peak and broad base of the Pα proﬁle makes it be decom-
posed easily into the broad and narrow components. There
is another weak yet signiﬁcant excess cusp on the blue side
of the Pα proﬁle. If this cusp belongs to Pα, its velocity off-
set is almost the same as the narrow cusp of Hβ mentioned
above (at velocity of - 900 km s- 1 in Figure 5). Therefore,
we take this cusp as the third component of the Pα proﬁle

In addition,

in the model. Every components are modeled with (multi-
ple) Gaussians. Initially, the narrow, the blueshifted cuspy,
and the broad components are ﬁtted with one Gaussian each;
more additional Gaussian(s) can be added into the model for
a component if the χ2 decreases signiﬁcantly with an F-test
probability ≤0.05. A ﬁrst-order polynomial is adopted to ﬁne
tune the local continuum. The ﬁtting turns out, with a reduced
χ2 of 0.99, that the narrow component and the blueshited cusp
are well ﬁtted with a single Gaussian each, and the broad com-
ponent is sufﬁciently ﬁtted with two Gaussians (see Figure 6).
The Pγ emission line is heavily blended with the
He I λ10830 emission line.
two broad
He I* λ10830 absorption troughs are located in the blue wing
of the He Iλ10830 emission line, which increases the com-
plexity of decomposing this blend. We use the Pα as the tem-
plate to ﬁt Pγ. To be speciﬁc, we assume that Pγ has also three
components, namely the narrow, broad and blueshifted cuspy
ones, and every components share the same proﬁle as the cor-
responding one of Pα, only with free intensity factors.12 The
proﬁle of the He I λ10830 emission line is different from that
of Pα, except that its blueshifted cusp is located at a similar
blueshifted velocity to the cusps of Pα and Hβ. We under-
stand that He Iλ10830 is a high-ionization line (with a ion-
ization potential of 24.6 eV), and it is well known that high-
ionization lines generally have a more complex proﬁle than
low-ionization lines (e.g., C IV λ1549, Wang et al. 2011; see
also Zhang et al. 2011). This is interpreted by the presence
of pronounced other components in high-ionization lines—
particularly the emission originated from the AGN outﬂows—
in addition to the normal component emitting from the viri-
alized BLR clouds that is located at the systematic redshift
(see, e.g., Zhang et al. 2011; ?) To get a convergent ﬁtting for
the He I line, We use the proﬁle of the broad Pα (namely the
two-Gaussian model) as the template to model the virialized
broad He I component, a Gaussian to model the NLR-emitted
He I, a Gaussian to the blueshifted cusp, and as many more
Gaussians as statistically guaranteed (namely F- test proba-
bility ≤0.05) to account for the remaining ﬂux. In the ﬁtting,
the absorption region is carefully masked. The best-ﬁt model
is shown in the lower left panel of Figure 6 with a reduced
χ2 = 1.15; the best-ﬁt parameters as listed in Table 3. Be-
sides the virialized broad component, the NLR one and the
cusp, ﬁnally there are two additional Gaussians to account
for an extra blueshifted broad component. This extra compo-
nent is blueshifted (by 1360 km s- 1), which is consistent with
the aforementioned outﬂow interpretation for the proﬁles of
high-ionization broad lines. Note that such a blueshifting is
not a direct identiﬁcation but merely ascribed to the asym-
metry of the broad-line He Iλ10830 proﬁle, which is different
from the situation of the blueshifted narrow cusp component.
Hereafter when necessary, for the ease of narration we denote
this blueshifted broad component with “outﬂowB”, and the
blueshifted narrow cusp “outﬂowN”.

In the optical, Hα shows a strong broad base and an appar-
ent narrow peak, which are blended with [N II]λλ6548,6583
doublet. The red wing of the broad base is also slightly
affected by [S II]λλ6716,6731 doublet. Hβ, as we stress
in the above, shows an apparent narrow cusp blueshifted
by ≈ 900 km s- 1, which is consistent with the extra cuspy

12 Except the width of the narrow Pγ, for which we adopt the ﬁtting result
with it set to be free (cf. Table 3). This is because the narrow Pγ component
stands high over the broad component and the ﬁtting can be signiﬁcantly
improved by relaxing its width from being tied to that of narrow Pα.

components revealed in Pα and He Iλ10830 (see Figure 5).
This suggests that Hα should also have such a blueshifted
cuspy component. Since the Balmer lines are heavily blended
with strong Fe II multiplet emission, we ﬁt the continuum-
subtracted spectrum (namely, simultaneously ﬁtting Balmer
lines + [O III] + [N II] + [S II] + Fe II), following the methodol-
ogy of Dong et al. (2008). Speciﬁcally, we assume the broad,
narrow and blueshifted cuspy components of Hβ and Hγ have
the same proﬁles as the respective components of Hα. The
[O III]λλ4959,5007 doublet lines are assumed to have the
same proﬁle and ﬁxed in separation by their laboratory wave-
lengths; the same is applied to [N II]λλ6583,6548 doublet
lines and to [S II]λλ6716,6731 doublet lines. The ﬂux ratio
of the [O III] doublet λ5007/λ4959 is ﬁxed to the theoreti-
cal value of 2.98 (?Storey & Zeippen 2000; Dimitrijevi´c et al.
2007); the ﬂux ratio of the [N II] doublet λ6583/λ6548 is
ﬁxed to the theoretical value of 2.96 (?Acker et al. 1989;
Storey & Zeippen 2000). We use Gaussians to model every
components of the above emission lines, as we describe in
the above for the NIR lines, starting with one Gaussian and
adding in more if the ﬁt can be improved signiﬁcantly ac-
cording to the F- test. The best-ﬁt model turns out that two
Gaussians are used for the broad component of the Hydrogen
Balmer lines, one for the narrow component, and one for the
blueshifted cusp; two Gaussians are used for every line of the
[O III] doublet, and one for all the other aforementioned nar-
row lines. The Fe II multiplet emission is model with the two
separate sets of analytic templates of Dong et al. (2008), one
for the broad-line Fe II system and the other for the narrow-
line system, constructed from measurements of I Zw 1 by
Véron-Cetty et al. (2004). Within each system, the respective
set of Fe II lines is assumed to have no relative velocity shifts
and the same relative strengths as those in I Zw 1. We assume
that the broad and narrow Fe II lines have the same proﬁles as
the broad and narrow Hβ, respectively; see Dong et al. (2008,
2011) for the detail and justiﬁcation. A ﬁrst-order polyno-
mial is adopted to ﬁne-tune the local continuum of the Hα
+ [N II] + [S II] region and the Hβ + Hγ region, respectively.
The best-ﬁt model is presented in Figure 6, with a reduced χ2
of 2.34 in the Hβ + Hγ region and a reduced χ2 of 1.46 in
Hα + [N II] + [S II] region. The somehow large reduced χ2
in the Hβ + Hγ region is mainly due to the excess emission
in the red wing of Hβ, the so-called “red-shelf” commonly
seen in type-1 AGNs and has been discussed in the literature
(e.g., Meyers & Peterson 1985; Véron et al. 2002). It is prob-
ably the residual of Fe II multiplet 42 (λ4924,5018,5169), or
broad He Iλλ4922,5016 lines (see Véron et al. 2002), or just
the mis-match between Hα and Hβ. Since it is irrelevant to
the components of interest in this work, we do not discuss it
further. We also ﬁt [O II] λ3727 line, which is well isolated
and easily ﬁtted with two Gaussians (see Figure 5).

The measured line parameters are listed in Table 3. The
extinction of the broad, narrow, and blueshifted cuspy com-
ponents of the Balmer lines can be derived from the ob-
served Balmer decrement Hα/Hβ. The intrinsic value of
broad-line Hα/Hβ is 3.06 with a standard deviation of
0.03 dex Dong et al. (2008). A value of 3.1 is gener-
ally adopted for the intrinsic narrow-line Hα/Hβ in AGN
(Halpern & Steiner 1983; Gaskell & Ferland 1984). The in-
trinsic Pα/Hβ of AGNs is very close to the Case-B value 0.34
(Gaskell & Ferland 1984). In Table 4, we list the observed
Hα/Hβ and Pα/Hβ as well as EB- V assuming the extinction
curve of the LMC (RV = 2.6). The extinctions to the broad

A He I* BALQSO in the Transitional Phase

components and to the blueshifted cusps are similar, while
the narrow components suffer much lager extinction, indicat-
ing that the NLR could be more dust-obscured.

2.4.3. Absorption lines

J1634+2049 shows He I*λλ3889,10830 and Na I D broad
absorption lines, which are generally deemed to be caused by
AGN outﬂows. To analyze the absorbed intensities, we need
ﬁrst to identify the pre-absorption AGN spectrum and nor-
malize the data with it. We ﬁrst subtract the best-ﬁt narrow
emission lines and the starlight component from the observed
spectrum before normalization, since the absorption gas does
not cover the NLR in all well studied BALs. There are three
components left in the observed spectrum:
the power-law
continuum, the broad emission lines, and the blackbody (hot
dust) continuum. He I* absorption lines might be normalized
in different ways, depending on whether or not the absorb-
ing gas covers the torus and/or the BLR. We notice that the
He I*λ10830 absorption trough shows a ﬂat bottom, which in-
dicates that the He I*λ10830 line is saturated and the residual
ﬂuxes should be zero in those pixels. Meanwhile, we ﬁnd the
residual ﬂuxes at the line centroid of He I*λ10830 is close to
zero after subtracting the starlight continuum (see the middle
panel in Figure 4). Again we check carefully the decompo-
sition of the continuum. The fractions of the power-law and
starlight in the optical are determined by the decomposition of
images, which should be reliable. The ﬁtted blackbody con-
tinuum, which origins from the hot dust of the torus, is the
dominant emission in the K band and the WISE W1 band,
which also accords with the expectation. Therefore, we con-
clude that the absorbing gas is likely exterior to the torus.

Left panels of Figure 7 demonstrate the absorption proﬁles
of He I*λλ3889,10830 and Na I D absorption lines in veloc-
ity space. On the SDSS spectrum, the He I*λ3889 absorption
is clearly detected. It splits into 2 absorption troughs, includ-
ing a larger one near -4100 km s- 1, and second one near -
3400 km s- 1, and totally covering the velocity ranges -5000
– -2800 km s- 1(trough A and B in Figure 7). The strong
He I*λ10830 absorption line is identiﬁed on the TripleSpec
spectrum. It separates into 2 major troughs spreading from
v ∼ - 5000 km s- 1to v ∼ - 2000 km s- 1(trough A+B, C in Fig-
ure 7). He I*λ3889 and He I*λ10830 are transitions from the
same lower level, so they should have the same velocity pro-
ﬁle theoretically. The strongest trough, which corresponds to
the trough A and B of He I*λ3889, is obvious saturated, since
the bottom of the absorption line is ﬂat. This can be naturally
explained by the large optical depths ratio of He I*λ10830 and
He I*λ3889. The Na I Dλλ5890,5896 proﬁle also two prin-
cipal components, the velocities of which correspond to the
absorption troughs A and B of He I*λ3889. The appearance
of neutral Sodium absorption lines suggests the large column
densities of the absorption gas and the neutral Sodium exists
deep in the clouds, otherwise neutral Sodium will be easily
ionized. The third He I*λ10830 trough (trough C) has a weak
counterpart of He I*λ3889 and Na I D.

We use the Voigt proﬁle (Hjerting 1938; Carswell et al.
1984) to ﬁt these absorption troughs, which are shown in Fig-
ure 7. The Voigt proﬁle is implemented with the program
x_voigt in the XIDL package.13 He I*λλ3889,10830 are the
strongest two transitions from the metastable state to the 2p,
3p states, and the τ ratio (∝ λ fikNion) of He I*λλ10830,3889

13 http://www.ucolick.org/ xavier/IDL/

is 23.5:1 (Liu et al. 2015, their Table 2). If the lines are not
saturated and the absorbers fully cover the source, the nor-
malized ﬂux R10830 = R23.5
3889. The cyan dotted line in the upper
left panel of Figure 7 shows the He I*λ10830 absorption pro-
ﬁle predicted from the He I*λ3889 absorption trough under
the full-coverage assumption. The red wing of the observed
He I*λ10830 absorption line ﬁts well the predicted proﬁle,
while the blue wing of the observed proﬁle is evidently dif-
ferent from the predicted. This suggests a full-coverage sit-
uation for the absorbing gas of low outﬂowing speed, and a
partial coverage for the gas of high speed.

Based on the above inference, we try to estimate the cov-
ering factor of the outﬂow gas assuming a simple partial-
coverage model, where the observed normalized spectrum can
be expressed as follows:

R = (1 - C f (v)) +C f (v)e- τ (v).

(2)

Here, the τ ratio of He I*λλ10830,3889 is 23.5. Although
the spectral resolutions of the SDSS and TripleSpec spectrum
are not high enough for us to study the velocity structure of
absorption trough in detail, the tendency and the mean of Cf
are reliable. We bin the spectrum by 3 pixels and perform
the calculation and analysis using the binned data. Following
the methodology of Leighly et al. (2011), we derive the cov-
ering fraction (Cf), the optical depth (τ) and column density
of He I*, as a function of velocity (see right panels of Fig-
ure 7). the covering factor of outﬂow with v < 4300 km s- 1
is close to 1.0, contrast with the high speed outﬂow with
v > 4300 km s- 1. The average covering factor of component
A is 0.82, and log NHe I∗(cm- 2) = 15.01 ± 0.16. Assuming
Na I D absorption lines have the same covering factor with
He I* absorption lines, then we get the ionic column density
of Na I is log NHaI(cm- 2) = 13.31 ± 0.21.

2.5. Analysis of the Spitzer spectrum

The MIR spectrum of J1634+2049 shows signiﬁcant poly-
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features and a
steeply rising continuum toward long wavelength end (see
Figure 8). We measured the apparent strength (namely the
apparent optical depth) of the 9.7µm silicate feature follow-
ing the deﬁnition by Spoon et al. (2007),

Ssil = ln

fobs(9.7µm)
fcont(9.7µm)

,

(3)

where fobs(9.7µm) is the observed ﬂux density at 9.7µm and
fcont(9.7µm) is the continuum ﬂux density at 9.7µm. Following
Spoon et al. (2007), we estimate fcont(9.7µm) from a power-
law interpolation over 5.5–14.0µm. It gives Ssil = 0.01 ± 0.03
(1σ), indicating (almost) neither silicate emission nor absorp-
tion. It is interesting that the silicate absorption is not present
at all, as the analysis in the UV and optical bands demon-
strates instead that J1634+2049 is dust-obscured. In the di-
agnostic diagram of EW (PAH 6.2 µm) vs. 9.7 µm silicate
strength as shown in Figure 1 of Spoon et al. (2007), galax-
ies are located mainly around two branches closely: a diag-
onal and a horizontal. J1634+2049 belongs to the horizontal
branch in the 1A class (EW(PAH 6.2µm) = 0.050±0.003, see
Table 5). Interestingly, Mrk 231 also belongs to this class but
with a larger 9.7µm silicate absorption strength (Ssil ∼ - 0.65)
as well as a smaller PAH 6.2µm EW (∼ 0.01). As discussed
by Spoon et al. (2007), the two distinct branches reﬂect likely
the differences in the spatial distribution of the nuclear dust.

W.-J. Liu et al.

Galaxies in the horizontal branch may have clumpy dust dis-
tributions, which produce only shallow absorption features. In
J1634+2049, as we analyzed above, the narrow emission lines
suffer larger extinction than the broad emission lines, and the
young stellar component is obscured more seriously than the
AGN continuum and broad/narrow emission lines. This im-
plies that the dust in the nuclear region is clumpy and patchy;
i.e., the nuclear region is not fully enshrouded by dust. Mean-
while, there are signiﬁcant Ne II 12.8µm and Ne III 15.6µm
emission lines, but no higher-ionization lines such as Ne V
14.3µm and [O VI] 25.89µm in the MIR spectrum; this may
indicates that the AGN contributes insigniﬁcantly to the MIR
emission (Farrah et al. 2007).

We use the PAHFIT spectral decomposition code (v1.2) 14
(Smith et al. 2007) to ﬁt the spectrum as a sum of dust at-
tenuated starlight continuum, thermal dust continuum, PAH
features, and emission lines. As the above analysis sug-
gests that the AGN contribution in the MIR ﬂux is low, we
adopt the fully mixed extinction geometry. Figure 8 shows
the MIR spectrum and the best-ﬁt decomposition with a re-
duced χ2 = 1.16. The τ9.7 is ﬁtted to be ∼ 0. The ﬂuxes
of the main MIR components derived form the PAHFIT are
listed in Table 5. The ﬂux errors are given by PAHFIT; see
Smith et al. (2007) for the detail. The errors of the EWs
are estimated according to error propagation formula, where
the uncertainties of continuum is estimated as follows. For
the spectral region of every emission line feature, we calcu-
late the residual between the raw spectrum and the best-ﬁt
(continuum + line), and then the standard deviation of the
residual in this region is taken as the 1-σ error of the con-
tinuum placement. The total PAH Luminosity Log LPAH (erg
s- 1) = 43.64±0.02, which is ∼1.2% of total IR luminosity of
this source. We estimate star formation rate from the PAH
features using the relation of Farrah et al. (2007), SFR(M⊙,
yr- 1) = 1.18 × 10- 41 L(PAH 6.2µm + PAH 11.2µm), and the
errors of the SFR derived using this equation are of order ∼
50% for individual objects. According to our measurements,
we get the SFRPAH = 141 ±71 M⊙yr- 1. As a double check, we
also estimate the SFR from the 24µm emission. Adopting the
relation for galaxies with LIR ≥ 1011L⊙ of Rieke et al. (2009),
the error of the SFR derived from which is whitin 0.2 dex, we
- 53 M⊙yr- 1. The SFR values estimated
get SFR24µm ∼ 143+84
from the PAH, 24µm emissions and the total IR luminosity are
well consistent, and are also consistent with the upper limit of
the SFR estimated from the IR luminosity. Hence, we adopt
the SFR estimated from PAH in this paper.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Central Black Hole

With the measured luminosity and line-width of the broad
emission lines, we can estimate the mass of the central BH
using the commonly used virial mass estimators. We use the
broad-Hα based mass formalism given by Xiao et al. (2011,
their Eq. 6), which is based on Greene & Ho (2005, 2007) but
incorporates the recently updated relation between BLR size
and AGN luminosity calibrated by Bentz et al. (2009). The
broad-Hα luminosity is corrected for the broad-line extinction
using the LMC extinction curve, resulting LHα = 1.5 × 1043
erg s- 1. Together with FWHM(Hα) = 2955 km s- 1, the central
Black hole mass is estimated to be MBH = 7.94 × 107M⊙.

The best-ﬁt EB- V value of

is 0.42 (assuming the LMC ex-
tinction curve), and the extinction corrected luminosity
λLλ(5100) = 2.47 × 1044erg s- 1. As a check, we also estimate
the λLλ(5100) from the Hα ﬂux (Greene & Ho 2005), which
gives λLλ(5100) = 2.49 × 1044 erg s- 1, fairly consistent with
the above one obtained from the best-ﬁt power-law. Then
we calculate the bolometric luminosity using the conversion
Lbol = 0.75 × 4.89 + 0.91λLλ(5100) (Runnoe et al. 2012),
which gives Lbol = 1.45 × 1045 erg s- 1. The corresponding
Eddington ratio is thus Lbol/LEdd = 0.15. Based on the
bolometric luminosity, the amount of mass being accreted is
estimated as follows,

ηc2 = 0.26M⊙yr- 1 ,

where we assumed an accretion efﬁciency η of 0.1, and c is
the speed of light.

3.2. Host Galaxy

The 2D decomposition of the SDSS images (§2.3) yields
that the host galaxy is an early type galaxy with Sérsic index
n = 4 and Mr = - 22.07 mag. We use the K-band luminosity
of the starlight to calculate the stellar mass of J1634+2049,
which is relatively insensitive to dust absorption and to stel-
lar population age. Into & Portinari (2013) provides a cali-
bration of mass-to-light ratios against galaxy colors, and we
here adopt their table 3 relation for log M/LKs = 1.055 (B- V)
- 1.066 with a scatter of ±0.13 dex. The B, V magnitude
and LKs of J1634+2049 is calculated by convolving the de-
composed stellar component (see 2.4.1) with the Jonson B
band and V band response curve. We get B - V = 0.63 and
LKs = 2.4 × 1044 erg s- 1, the stellar mass estimated from LKs
is Mhost = (1.8 ± 0.54) × 1011M⊙. The error estimate ac-
counts for the uncertainty of decomposition of starlight in K
band (see §2.4.1) and the uncertainty of M/LKs. As a check,
we also use V band luminosity to estimate the stellar mass.
The UV-NIR continuum decompostion (§2.4.1) shows that
the galaxy is dominated by an old stellar population with an
age of ≈ 9 Gyr, which corresponds to a mass-to-light ratio of
M/LV ≈ 5.2 M⊙/L⊙,V (Bruzual & Charlot 2003). The V-band
luminosity of the old stellar population is calculated by con-
volving the decomposed old stellar component with Jonson
V-band response curve, which gives LV = 9.24 × 1043 erg s- 1.
Thus the stellar mass is Mhost ≈ 1.34 × 1011M⊙, which is ba-
sically consistent with stellar mass estimated from K-band lu-
minosity.

Both the decomposition of the UV to NIR spectrum and
the analysis of its SED and MIR spectrum reveal that there
is a heavily obscured young stellar component (see §2.4.1)
relating to the recent violent (obscured) star formation activ-
ities. This stellar component is heavily obscured in the UV
and optical bands. We can not see any sign of star forma-
tion activities from the optical image either. According to the
decomposition of the optical continuum, this component ac-
counts for . 5% of the total continuum emission at 5100Å.
The best-ﬁt result of the spectral decomposition gives the ex-
tinction of this component is EB- V = 2.2 (see §2.4.1). That’s
why we can only reliably infer the presence of this young stel-
lar component from the PAH emission in the Spitzer spectrum
and the high FIR luminosity.

It is interesting to note the fact that the AGN narrow

A He I* BALQSO in the Transitional Phase

log ([S II]λλ6716,6731/Hα) =

emission lines suffer more dust obscuration than the AGN
broad lines, and the young stellar component suffer more
than the two. This may tell us some clues of the spa-
tial distribution of the dust.
The AGN NLR is proba-
bly related to the heavily obscured H-II region. Next we
investigate the situations of the observed narrow emission
lines in all the available bands, which are in principle pow-
ered by both starburst and AGN. The optical narrow emis-
sion lines are observed to have the following line ratios:
log (Hβ/[O III]λ5007) = 0.86 ± 0.03,15 log ([N II]λ6583/Hα)
- 0.23 ±
= 0.03 ± 0.01,
0.01, and log ([O I]λ6300/Hα) = - 0.85 ± 0.04. Accord-
ing to the BPT diagnostics diagrams (Baldwin et al. 1981;
Kauffmann et al. 2003; Kewley et al. 2006), J1634+2049 is
classiﬁed as a purely Seyfert galaxy, indicating that these ob-
served optical line ﬂuxes are mainly powered by the AGN.
Then how are the NIR narrow emission lines? As we know,
the NIR narrow emission lines should be less affected by
dust obscuration, and so the observed narrow Pα could be
powered by both the AGN and the star formation consid-
erably. Thus a conservative starburst-powered Pα emission
can be estimated as follows. We take (reasonably) the nar-
row Hβ to be totally from the AGN NLR, and correct it for
the nuclear dust reddening by the narrow-line Balmer decre-
ment (see Table 4), giving the unreddened narrow Hβ ﬂux
of 1.3 ± 0.32 × 10- 14 erg s- 1 cm- 2.
In AGN NLR environ-
ment the line ratio Pα/Hβ is close to the Case-B value for
all conditions, and the value is ∼ 0.34 (Gaskell & Ferland
1984). Thus the AGN-powered narrow Pα ﬂux (unreddened)
can be estimated from the unreddened narrow Hβ ﬂux, giv-
ing 4.4 ± 1.1 × 10- 15 erg s- 1 cm- 2. Similarly, we estimate the
total unreddened narrow Pα ﬂux by applying the same dust
extinction as the narrow Hβ, which is certainly a conservative
estimate (lower limit) of the Pα ﬂux (since the star-formation
region is obscured more seriously than the AGN NLR); this
yields the total unreddened narrow Pα > 7.3 ± 0.3 × 10- 15
erg s- 1 cm- 2 Å- 1 (both the AGN and starburst powered). So
the AGN-powered is at most 61% of the total narrow Pα ﬂux.
That is, more than 39% of the narrow Pα is powered by star-
burst.

With interest, we try to investigate the relationship between
the galactic bulge and the central BH. As we cannot measure
the stellar velocity dispersion from the optical spectra, we use
instead the velocity dispersion of the line-emitting gas in the
NLR as traced by the low-ionization [S II]λλ6716,6731 lines
as a surrogate (Greene & Ho 2005; Komossa & Xu 2007).
For σ⋆ ≃ σ[SII] = 178.8km s- 1, the MBH–σ⋆ relation for early
type galaxies of McConnell & Ma (2013, their Table 2) pre-
dicts MBH = 1.37 × 108M⊙, which is 1.6 times the virial BH
mass based on the broad Hα line. Now we take the Sérsic
n = 4 component (§2.3) as the galactic bulge, the MBH–Lbulge
relation for early type galaxies of McConnell & Ma (2013,
their Table 2) predicts MBH = 3.47 × 108M⊙, which is ∼ 4.4
times the virial estimate based on the broad Hα line. Consid-
ering the large uncertainties associated with these quantities
(both methodologically and statistically), at this point we can
only say that both the MBH–σ⋆ and MBH–Lbulge relationships
of the nearby inactive galaxies seem to hold in this object.

15 As the whole proﬁle of [O III]λ5007 is blueshifted (see Figure 5), which
is not the case of the other unshifted narrow emission lines (e.g., Hβ, Hα).
We only integrate ﬂuxes within - 500—500 km s- 1 corresponding to the Hβ
narrow lines.

3.3. The companion galaxy and the galactic ring

There are two small faint galaxies to the west of of the ring
(C1 and C2 in Figure 9). The projected distances from the
center of J1634+2049 to the centers of C1 and C2 are 18′′.5
and 19′′.1, corresponding to 35.7 kpc and 44.0 kpc, respec-
tively. We spectroscopically observed the C1 and C2 galax-
ies using YFOSC mounted on Lijiang GMG 2.4m telescope.
The right panel of Figure 9 shows the obtained spectra of
J1634+2049 and C1. The C2 galaxy is too faint to get an ef-
fective spectrum. In the right top panel of Figure 9, the spec-
tra of the Lijiang 2.4m telescope and of the SDSS are com-
pared to make sure that the wavelength calibration is reliable,
which is key to determine the redshift of C1. The spectrum
of C1 galaxy shows characteristics of an early-type galaxy
(ETG) of old stellar population, with visible stellar absorp-
tion features and no emission lines. By comparing the C1
spectrum with the template spectra in the SWIRE template li-
brary (Polletta et al. 2007), a best-matched template of ellip-
tical galaxy of 5 Gyr old is picked up. Because of no strong
emission lines, we perform a grid search of redshift for the
redshift of C1. The searching procedure is as follows. The
redshift grids are set to be 0.11 < z < 0.15. In every redshift
grid, the template spectrum is brought to the observer-frame,
and is reddened with the Milky Way extinction along the di-
rection of C1; then we ﬁt the observed C1 spectrum with the
reddened template and calculate the χ2. In this way we ob-
tain the curve of χ2 with redshift, as shown in the bottom
panel of Figure 9. The redshift value corresponding to the
smallest χ2 is taken as the best-ﬁt redshift of the C1 galaxy,
which is 0.1276 with the 1-σ error of 0.0004 (∆χ2 = 1). Re-
calling the redshift of J1634+2049 being z = 0.1293, the red-
shifts of the J1634+2049 and C1 implies that the two galaxies
form a collisional system with a line of sight (LOS) veloc-
ity difference of ≈ 451 km s- 1. We also calculate the V band
luminosity for C1 by convolving the spectrum with Jonson
V band ﬁlter, yielding LV = 7.8 × 1042 erg s- 1. Though the
best matched template for C1 shows a stellar age of 5 Gyr,
the real stellar age of C1 is hard to determine with the low
signal-to-noise (S/N) spectrum. The colors (g-r, r-i) of C1
from the photometry are (1.03, 0.34), which are even redder
than that of J1634+2049. It is likely that the stellar age of
C1 is older than 9 Gyr. To be conservative, we argue the
stellar age of C1 should be older than 5 Gyr. For a stellar
population of solar metallicity with an ages of 5 Gyr and 12
Gyr, the mass-to-light ratios M/LV are between 3.36 and 6.68
M⊙/L⊙,V (Bruzual & Charlot 2003). Thus the stellar mass of
C1 Mc1 is estimated to within 7.3 × 109 – 1.45 × 1010M⊙.
Figure 2 shows that J1634+2049 is an ETG (an elliptical or
a S0 galaxy) with a ring structure. The off-centered ring is
an ellipse in the sky, with its major and minor axes being ∼
14′′.0 (32.3 kpc) and ∼ 12.′′7 (29.4 kpc), respectively. In §2.3
we measured the quantities of the ring as well as the main
body (namely the Sérsic) of the host galaxy from the SDSS
images (see Table 2). The colors (g - r, r -
i) of the Sérsic
component are (0.93, 0.5), and the ring, (0.94, 0.48). The
similarity of the colors between the two components suggests
that the ring may have the same stellar population as the Sérsic
component, (averagely) aging ≈ 9–12 Gyr. Taking the above
implication, the ring has LV,ring = 1.9 ×1043 erg s- 1, and stellar
mass Mring = 2.9 × 1010M⊙.

There are several theories proposed to explain the forma-
tion and evolution of the ring galaxies: (1) head-on colli-

10

W.-J. Liu et al.

sions between a disk galaxy and a intruder with a mass of at
least one tenth of the disk galaxy (e.g. Lynds & Toomre 1976;
Theys & Spiegel 1977; Toomre 1978; Mapelli et al. 2008;
Mapelli & Mayer 2012; Smith et al. 2012), (2) Lindblad res-
onances which forms a smooth ring with a central nucleus
and with the absence of companion galaxies (Buta et al. 1999)
and (3) accretion scenario which forms the polar ring galaxies
(Bournaud & Combes 2003). The ring around J1634+2049
and observation on the nearby galaxy, C1, suggest a head-on
collision scenario for the formation of the ring. Besides, the
same color of the stars in the ring and the host galaxy con-
ﬁrms such a formation history. The ring around J1634+2049
is offset to the galactic center (the nucleus), which resem-
bles the collisional RN class of galactic rings proposed by
Theys & Spiegel (1976). Numerical simulations showed that
the ring structure can be created in the stellar, or cold gas
or both contents of galactic disk by the radial propagation
of a density wave which is formed in the collision (e.g.
Lynds & Toomre 1976; Theys & Spiegel 1977; Toomre 1978;
Mapelli et al. 2008; Mapelli & Mayer 2012). Numerical sim-
ulations also showed that an off-center collision can produce
the offset of the central nucleus and the elliptical rings (e.g.
Lynds & Toomre 1976; Mapelli & Mayer 2012; ?). The in-
clination angle of the collisional parent galaxies are related
to the ellipticity of a galactic ring (?, Eq. 7). The ellipticity
of the ring around J1634+2049 is ǫ ≡ 1 - b/a ≈ 0.09, where
a and b are the major and minor axes of the projected ring.
The ellipticity of the ring is small, so that the off-center col-
lision and inclination effects are small. Besides, the impact
parameter (i.e., the minimal distance between the bullet and
the disk galaxy) sensitively affects the morphology of the ring
(Toomre 1978). The ring is more lopsided and the nucleus
is more offset when the impact parameter is larger. The ring
structure disappears when the impact parameter is too large,
and spiral structure forms instead. The ring structure is clearly
around the J1634+2049, and it is offset. Thus we may infer
that J1634+2049 and C1 had experienced an off-centered col-
lision with a small impact parameter.

3.4. Determining the physical condition of the outﬂows
As described in §2.4.3, strong blueshifted absorption
troughs show in the optical and NIR spectra,
indicating
the presence of strong outﬂows. The decomposition of the
emission-line proﬁles (§2.4.2) also indicates that the presence
of outﬂows in emission as revealed by the blueshifted line
components of almost all the observed emission lines. In this
subsection, we analyze and determine the physical properties
of both the absorption-line and emission-line outﬂows using
photoionization synthesis code Cloudy (c13.03; Ferland et al.
1998).

3.4.1. The absorption-line outﬂow

J1634+2049 shows He I*λλ3889,10830 and Na I D absorp-
tion lines in its NUV, optical and NIR spectra. The phys-
ical conditions of the absorbers are quite different to gen-
erate He I* and Na I D absorption lines. The metastable 2s
state in the helium triplet, He I* is populated via recombi-
nation of He+ ions, which is ionized by photons with ener-
gies of hν ≥ 24.56 eV. Therefore He I*is a high-ionization
line, and its column density (NHe I∗) mainly grows in the very
front of hydrogen ionization front and stops growing behind
it (e.g., Arav et al. 2001; Ji et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2015). In-
stead, Na I D absorption line is produced by neutral Sodium,

the potential of which is only 5.14 eV, and is easily destroyed
by the hard AGN continuum, therefore this line is rare to de-
tect in quasar spectra. It can only exist where dust is present
to shield neutral sodium from the intense UV (≥ 5.14 eV)
radiation ﬁled of the AGN that would otherwise photoionize
it to Na+.
In §2.4.3, we get the column densities of He I*
and Na I for the major absorption trough A+B (see Figure 7),
logNHe I∗(cm- 2) = 15.01 ±0.16, logNHaI(cm- 2) = 13.31 ±0.21.
Low-ionized Ca II H & K absorption lines usually present with
Na I D lines. Ca II H & K absorption lines arise from Ca+
ions, which is ionized by photons with energies of hν ≥ 6.11
eV and destroyed by photons with energies of hν ≥ 11.8 eV.
We ﬁnd no apparent Ca II H & K absorption lines in the NUV
spectrum, and this is probably because calcium element is de-
pleted into the dust grains. We estimate the upper limit of
column densities Ca II by shifting Na I D absorption proﬁle to
Ca II H wavelength, and use the proﬁle as a template to ﬁt the
Ca II H region. The upper limit of column density of Ca II is
log NCa II(cm- 2) = 12.9. All above indicates the dust should
be considered in the photoionization models. In addition, we
also notice there are no apparent Balmer-line absorption lines
in the spectrum of J1634+2049, and we get the upper limit
of column densities of hydrogen n=2 is log NH(n=2) = 12.6
cm- 2. This suggests the electron densities of the absorbing gas
can not be higher than 108 cm- 2 (Leighly et al. 2011; Ji et al.
2012).

Here we present a simple model calculated by Cloudy
(c13.03; Ferland et al. 1998) to explore the conditions re-
quired to generate the measured He I* and Na I column den-
sities. We start by considering a gas slab illuminated by a
quasar, with a density of nH and a total column density of NH.
The SED incident on the outﬂowing gas has important con-
sequences for the ionization and thermal structures within the
outﬂow. Here we adopt the UV-soft SED, which is regarded
more realistic for radio-quiet quasars than the other available
SEDs provided by Cloudy (see the detailed discussion in §4.2
of Dunn et al. (2010)) The UV-soft SED we adopted here is a
superposition of a blackbody “big bump” and power laws, and
is set to be the default parameters given in the Hazy document
of Cloudy as follows: T = 150,000 K, αox = - 1.4, αuv = - 0.5,
αx = - 1 and the UV bump peaks at around 1 Ryd.

The above analysis shows the absorption material is a mix-
ture of dust grains and gas, so the dust-to-gas ratio and the
depletion of various elements from the gas phase into dust
should be taken into account in the models. The data of
J1634+2049 in hand favor the presence of dust of the LMC
extinction type, which certainly needs UV spectroscopic ob-
servations to conﬁrm. In the following model calculations, we
use the Cloudy’s built-in model of ISM grains and assume the
total (dust+gas) abundance of the absorption material to be the
solar abundance. So the gas-phase abundance changes with
the dust-to-gas ratio. As the Cloudy software does not account
for the conservations of the mass and abundance of the ele-
ments that are both in the gas-phase and depleted in the dust
grains, trying to keep the total abundances of various element
to be the solar, in the iterated Cloudy calculations we manu-
ally set the gas-phase abundance according to the dust content
we add. The Cloudy’s built-in grain model of ISM dust that
incorporates C, Si, O, Mg and Fe elements. Regarding the
Ca and Na elements, we adopt the built-in scheme of dust de-
pletion, with their gas-phase depletion factors being 10- 4 and

A He I* BALQSO in the Transitional Phase

11

0.2, respectively, which are the default recipe of Cloudy.16
Besides element abundances, dust-to-gas ratio (AV/NH) is an-
other key parameter in the Cloudy model involving dust. Ac-
cording to the measured narrow-line and broad-line extinc-
tion, we simply adopt AV = 2 for the dust in the cloud slab.
The total column density NH of the slab can be mutually con-
strained by comparing the measured Na I D, He I*, and the
non-detections (upper limits) of Ca II and Balmer absorption
lines with the Cloudy simulations in the parameters spaces.

We start the simulations ﬁrst with the dust-free baseline
models to get the initial total column density NH (the most
probable value; see below), and then we feed Cloudy with
the dust-to-gas ratio, AV/NH calculated by this NH and get
a new NH. Then we use this new NH into Cloudy and start
a new iteration. The simulations will be stopped when the
NH value is convergent. During every iteration, the Cloudy
simulations are run over the grids of the following parameter
space: ionization parameter - 2.5 ≤ log U ≤ 1.0, hydrogen
density 3 ≤ log nH (cm- 3)≤ 7, and the stop column density
21 ≤ log NH(cm- 2) ≤ 25 (see Liu et al. 2015 for the detail
of the Cloudy modeling). By comparing in the NH–U plane
the measured ionic column densities with those simulated by
Cloudy, we get the allowed parameter intervals for NH and U
as constrained mutually by the various absorption lines. The
details are illustrated in Figure 10.

In Figure 10, the upper three panels display dust-free mod-
els, and the lower three panels display the best models added
the effects of dust grains mixed in the gas slab.
In dust-
free models, the upper limit of NCa II is not considered, since
the measured value is much smaller than the models predict
due to the heavily dust depletion. We can see that dust-free
models with log n(H) (cm- 3) = 3 – 5 are in accord with the
measurements for this object. The dust-free models give the
initial NH (overlap region) and the initial dust-to-gas ratio
(AV/NH) for the following iterative calculation of dust mod-
els. The initial value of NH are around 1024 cm- 2, and the
initial AV/NH ∼ 2 × 10- 24 cm- 2 which is 1.7% of the ratio
of LMC, AV/NH = 1.2 × 10- 22 cm2 (Weingartner & Draine
2001). The lower three panels show the convergent solu-
tions (black open squares) of dust models. The suitable so-
lutions (log nH, logNH, log U) for the absorption-line out-
ﬂow of J1634+2049 are (4, 22.85±0.15, -0.55±0.22), (4.5,
22.6±0.18, -1.0±0.25) and (5, 22.5±0.17, -1.3±0.25).

3.4.2. Emission-line outﬂows

As Figure 5 demonstrates,

J1634+2049 also shows
emission-line outﬂows as
revealed by blueshifted hy-
drogen Balmer and Paschen lines, He I*λλ10830,5876,
[O III]λλ4959,5007, [O II]λ3727 and Ne IIIλ3869 lines, par-
ticularly by the blueshifted, well-separated cuspy compo-
nents. This narrow (FWHM . 650 km s- 1corrected for the
instrumental broadening) cusp exists only in the recombina-
tion lines, invisible in any forbidden emission lines.
It is
blueshifted by 900 km s- 1 with respect to the system red-
shift consistently in the hydrogen Balmer and Paschen lines
and He I lines; particularly, in the Hβ and He Iλ10830 this
component is well separated from the peaks of the normal
NLR- and BLR-originated components, obviously not an ar-
tifact of the line-proﬁle decomposition. Interestingly to note,
in light of its absence in forbidden lines, this line compo-

nent should be originated from the dense part of the out-
ﬂows. A second blueshifted line component, is present in
all high-ionization emission lines such as He Iλλ5876,10830,
[O III]λ4959,5007 and Ne IIIλ3869, with a similar asymmet-
ric proﬁle and similar best-ﬁt FWHM of ≈ 1600km s- 1. This
component is much stronger in ﬂux and relatively broader
than the cuspy component. Although in He Iλ10830 it is
not so well-separated from the normal NLR and BLR com-
ponents, this component manifests itself well in the forbid-
den lines [O III]λλ4959,5007 and Ne IIIλ3869 with the whole
emission line proﬁle being blueshifted, since there are no
other line components in these forbidden lines. The low-
ionization forbidden line [O II]λ3727 also shows an obvious
bulk-blueshifted component, in addition to the normal NLR-
originated component sit just at the system redshift that exists
in all low-ionization, forbidden emission lines (e.g., [N II] and
[S II]); this bulk-blueshifted component of [O II]λ3727 has a
smaller blueshift than in the aforementioned high-ionization
lines. Besides, we can infer that this second blueshifted com-
ponent (denoted as the broad outﬂow) should be originated
from the less dense part of the outﬂows, with density lower
than 106 cm- 3.17

The dynamics of the outﬂowing gas of this object should be
complex. Here we only consider about the strong, blueshifted
broad component of the emission lines, which is much
stronger than the cuspy narrow component. To investigate
the physical condition for the emission-line outﬂow gas, we
use the Cloudy simulations calculated above, and then con-
front these models with the measured line ratios to determine
NH, nH and U. As we demonstrate above, both the con-
tinuum and emission lines of J1634+2049 are heavily red-
dened by dust. So it is better for us to use the line ratios
of adjacent lines to minimize the effect of reddening. Be-
sides, the difference of ionization potential of the two lines
should be large in order for them to probe different zone in
a gas cloud. Thus we use the line ratios [O III]λ5007/Hβ
and He Iλ10830/Pγ here. Here the ﬂux of [O III] is mea-
sured by subtracting the ﬂux within ± 500 km s- 1 (cf. Foot-
note 15) from the whole [O III]λ5007 proﬁle, i.e., only the
ﬂux blueward of - 500 km s- 1; the ﬂux of He Iλ10830 is the
broad blueshifted component (see Table 3). We do not detect
the broad blueshifted component in hydrogen emission lines,
which may be weak and concealed in the best-ﬁt blueshifted
narrow component; so we take the blueshifted narrow com-
ponents of Hβ and Pγ as the upper limits here. There-
fore the lower limits of [O III]λ5007/Hβ and He Iλ10830/Pγ
are estimated to be 12.75±1.12 and 15.28±3.44. On the
modeling part, we ﬁrst extract the simulated [O III]λ5007,
He Iλ10830, Hβ and Pγ ﬂuxes from the dust-free Cloudy
simulations and then compute the line ratios [O III]λ5007/Hβ
and He Iλ10830/Pγ. Figure 11 shows results of the dust-free
models. The violet red and green lines show the observed
line ratios of He Iλ10830/Pγ and [O III]λ5007/Hβ, which are
lower limits of the actual line ratios for the outﬂow gas (see
above). So the region enclosed by the violet red and green
lines is the possible parameter space for the outﬂow gas of
this object. Model calculations suggest that gas clouds with
log 19 < NH(cm- 2) < 23 can generate the observed line ra-
tios of this object (Figure 11). Both He Iλ10830/Pγ and
[O III]λ5007/Hβ are sensitive to the hydrogen front, so the gas

Cloudy 13.03 manual Hazy and references therein.

17 The critical densities (ncrit) of [O III]λλ4959, 5007 and Ne IIIλ3869 are

which is too thin to contain a hydrogen front or gas which is
too thick can not generate the observed line ratios. Although
the appropriate NH spread 6 dex, the densities nH are conﬁned
to 4 ≤ log nH(cm- 3) ≤ 6, which is very close to the condi-
tion of absorption-line outﬂow gas. Thus we infer that the
blueshifted emission lines are produced in the same outﬂow-
ing material as the BALs. Based on this assumption, we ex-
tract these line ratios from the convergent dusty models (see
the lower three panels of Figure 10). In Figure 12, we only
shows models with NH = 1022.5 cm- 2 and NH = 1023 cm- 2,
which cover the parameter space of the convergent dusty mod-
els. The suitable parameter space to generate the observed
line ratios of J1634+2049 is 3.5 . log nH(cm- 3) . 5.5 and
- 1.8 . log U . - 0.7, which is well consistent with the results
of absorption-line outﬂows. Combined with the gas parame-
ters determined from the absorption lines, the acceptable pa-
rameters (lognH, logNH, logU) of the outﬂow are 4 < lognH
. 5, 22.5 . logNH . 22.9, and - 1.3 . logU . - 0.7. Note
that the grids with lognH = 4 cm- 3 is on the edge of the al-
lowed parameter space.

3.4.3. Kinetic luminosity and mass ﬂux of the outﬂow

After analyzing the absorption- and emission-line outﬂows,
we ﬁnd that the hydrogen density of both the absorption- and
emission-line outﬂows are quite similar, and that the derived
values of the ionization parameter U are also consistent. This
suggests that the blueshifted emission lines are plausibly orig-
inated in the absorption-line outﬂows. If it is the case, we can
accurately determine the kinetic properties of the outﬂows by
taking advantages of both the absorption lines and emission
lines. Speciﬁcally, the absorption lines, which trace the prop-
erties of the outﬂow in the LOS, is good at determining the
total column density (NH) and the velocity (gradient) of the
outﬂow; the emission lines, which trace the global properties
of the outﬂows, can determine better the total mass and global
covering factor of the outﬂows.

As the ﬁrst step, we determine the distance (R) of the out-
ﬂow (exactly speaking, the part producing the LOS absorp-
tion) away from the central source. The ionization parameter
U depends on R and hydrogen-ionizing photons emitted by
the central source (QH), as follows,
QH

U =

4πR2nH c

,

(5)

where nH is the density of the outﬂow and c is the speed
of light. The nH has been estimated as log nH ≈ 4 -
5
cm- 3. To determine the QH, we scale the UV-soft SED to
the de-reddened ﬂux of J1634+2049 at the WISE W 1 band
(∼ 3.4µm) (see Figure 13), and then integrate over the en-
ergy range hµ ≥ 13.6 eV of this scaled SED. This yields
QH = 4.2 × 1055 photons s- 1. To check the reliability of this
integration, we integrate also this scaled SED over the whole
energy range and get Lbol = 4.3 × 1045 erg s- 1, which is basi-
cally consistent with our estimated Lbol independently from
the obscuration-corrected continuum luminosity at 5100 Å
(see §3.1). Using this QH value together with the derived
nH and U, the R value can be derived, as listed in Table 6.
With R being 48–65 pc, the outﬂow is located exterior to the
torus, while the extend of the torus is on the scale of ∼ 10 pc
(Burtscher et al. 2013). This result is consistent with our qual-
itative analysis of the normalization for the intrinsic spectrum
underlying the absorption trough (see §2.4.3).

Assuming that the absorbing material can be described as
a thin (∆R/R ≪ 1 ), partially ﬁlled shell, the mass-ﬂow rate
( ˙M) and kinetic luminosity ( ˙Ek) can be derived as follows (see
the discussion in Borguet et al. (2012)),

˙M = 4πRΩ µmpNH v ,

˙Ek = 2πRΩ µmpNH v3 ,

(6)

(7)

We estimated the global covering fraction (Ω)

where R is the distance of the outﬂow from the central source,
Ω is the global covering fraction of the outﬂow, µ = 1.4 is
the mean atomic mass per proton, mp is the mass of pro-
ton, NH is the total hydrogen column density of the outﬂow
gas, and v is the weight-averaged velocity of the absorption
trough, which is directly derived from the trough’s proﬁle.
The weight-averaged v for the He I*λ3889 absorption trough
is - 3837 km s- 1. Note that the outﬂow velocity (v) should
be calculated with the absorption-line velocity, not with the
outﬂowing emission-line velocity. The absorption lines are
produced from the absorber moving along our LOS, whereas
the emission lines originates from gas outﬂowing along differ-
ent directions with respect to the observer. Thus the observed
outﬂow velocity of an emission line is a sum of the projected
velocities of the outﬂowing gas along different directions, and
should be smaller than the outﬂow velocity of the absorbing
material; this is just as we observed.
for
J1634+2049 by comparing the measured EW([O III]5007)
with the predicted one by the best Cloudy model (see §3.4.2).
Although to this end theoretically it is better to use recom-
bination lines such as Hβ and He Iλ10830, there is however
no good measurements of the Hβ for the relatively broad,
blueshifted component (see discussion in §3.4.2) and that
component of He Iλ10830 is heavily affected by the absorp-
tion trough. The EW([O III]) value is affected by the dust ex-
tinction both to the continuum and the [O III] λ5007 emission.
We make simple and reasonable assumptions as follows (cf.
§2.4.2): the continuum suffers dust extinction to the same de-
gree of the broad lines with EB- V = 0.64, and the [O III] λ5007
emission, within the range of dust-free and the broad-line one.
After corrected for the dust extinction, the actual EW([O III])
should be in the range of 4.3–24.8 Å. Here the outﬂowing
[O III] ﬂux is the same as used in §3.4.2 and the continuum
ﬂux is measured from the decomposed power-law component
at 5007Å. In Cloudy modeling, the emergent [O III] ﬂux is
output with the covering fraction being assumed to be 1. The
derived EW([O III]) is 82 Å for the model with n = 104.5 cm- 3,
and 142 Å for n = 105 cm- 3. Thus the global cover fraction (Ω)
for J1634+2049 is estimated to be in the range of 5.2–30.1%
for n = 104.5 cm- 3, or 3.0–17.4% for n = 105 cm- 3. Like-
wise, we estimate the Ω for the outﬂow emitting He Iλ10830,
yielding 72.9–100% (the case of n = 104.5 cm- 3) or 43.7–
71.7% (n = 105 cm- 3), which are much lager than those for
[O III] λ5007. The large difference between the Ω values es-
timated based on He Iλ10830 and [O III] may be mainly due
to the measurement uncertainty of the outﬂowing component
of He Iλ10830, and/or may reﬂect the inhomogeneity of the
outﬂowing gas. [O III] is a forbidden line that traces the re-
gion of low density only, and He Iλ10830, a recombination
line, can be generated in much broader spatial regions. Here
we conservatively adopt the Ω value estimated from [O III].
Thus the kinetic luminosity and mass loss rate are calculated,
as summarized in Table 6.

4. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

We performed a comprehensive, multiwavelength study of
the properties of J1634+2049, a local quasar with high IR lu-
minosity of LIR = 1011.91L⊙ and signatures of outﬂows both
in broad absorption lines and blueshifted emission lines. The
high IR luminosity indicates recent violent star formation ac-
tivities with SFR = 140 ± 43 M⊙ yr- 1, which is also in-
dicated by the PAH emission lines with a derived SFR =
141 ± 71M⊙yr- 1. In the UV and optical bands, interestingly,
there are few signs of star formation activities, and the de-
composition of the SDSS images demonstrate the host galaxy
is of early type in terms of its structural property (e.g., Sér-
sic n = 4) and the colors (e.g., g - r = 0.93). This quasar has
a circum-galactic ring on scales of ∼ 30 kpc. The ring has
almost the same colors as the host galaxy (namely the Sérsic
n = 4 component). Yet it is unclear at this point whether or not
the galactic ring has similar intense dust-enshrouded star for-
mation. There are two small galaxies to the west of it within
20′′ on the sky, the three being in almost a linear conﬁgura-
tion. We spectroscopically observed the galaxies and obtained
the redshift for the relatively bigger one (C1; the closer to
J1634+2049), z = 0.1298+0.007
- 0.005.

In the optical and near-infrared spectra, there are several
strong broad absorption lines and blueshifted emission lines
in addition to the normal, BLR- and NLR-originated emis-
sion lines, suggestive of the AGN outﬂows. These lines can
be used to derive (mutually constrain) the physical properties
of the outﬂowing gas, by confronting the observed with the
modeling results of the photoionization software Cloudy. The
appearance of the broad absorption line of neutral Sodium,
which is rare in an AGN environment, suggests that the out-
ﬂowing gas is thick and dusty. The physical parameters we
determined with Cloudy for absorption-line and emission-
line outﬂows are very close, with 104.5 ≤ nH ≤ 105 cm- 3,
10- 1.3 ≤ U ≤ 10- 1.0 and NH ≈ 1022.5 cm- 2. This similarity
suggests that those absorption and emission lines should be
generated in the common outﬂowing gas. Using the absorp-
tion lines to derive the total column density of the outﬂow,
and emission lines to obtain the global covering factor, we
estimate the distance of the absorbing material to the central
source, R ∼48–65 pc, exterior to the torus. These derived pa-
rameters allow us to calculate the kinetic luminosity and mass
loss rate of the outﬂow. The results listed in Table 6 indicate
that the outﬂow observed in J1634+2049 processes a large ki-
netic luminosity, high enough to play a major role in the AGN
feedback. Previous studies suggest that AGN feedback typi-
cally requires a mechanical energy input of roughly 0.5–5%
of Eddington luminosity of the quasar to heat the cold gas and
quench the star formation activities in the host galaxy (e.g.,
Hopkins & Elvis 2010; Scannapieco & Oh 2004).
Taking the multiwavelength results altogether, we can in-
fer the whole story as follows. J1634+2049 could have been
a disk galaxy with abundant gas, and was collided through
by one or two small galaxies with masses of ∼ 1 × 1010M⊙.
The violent head-on collision destroyed the disk and formed
a circum-galactic ring. The collision also triggered violent
star formation in the host galaxy, with the star formation re-
gions being heavily reddened by dust now and betraying it-
self in the IR bands only. We may infer that the violent star
formation is in the circum-nuclear region, as the optical im-
ages and spectrum demonstrate that the large scale of the host
galaxy is an elliptical galaxy dominant by an old stellar pop-

ulation. Indeed, in the generally believed scenario of galaxy
merger/collision and AGN feedback, as described in the In-
troduction section, the large-scale cold gas of the interacting
galaxies loses angular momentum and is driven into the nu-
clear region due to the gravitational potential well; the infall
of the cold gas triggers nuclear star formation and also feeds
the central SMBH. This inference is further support by the
fact that the narrow emission lines (dominated by the AGN
according to the BPT diagrams) as well as the broad emission
lines are seriously obscured by dust, hinting at a common ori-
gin of the dust to the optical emission of both the AGN and
star formation. The existence of neutral sodium broad absorp-
tion line also indicates that the nuclear region is dusty. With
huge kinetic luminosity, the outﬂows launched by the AGN
in turn will blow away the gas and dust around the nucleus
and even inhibit the star formation in the host galaxy soon
or later, as the co-evolution scenario suggests. At this time
point, J1634+2049 is just like the prototypal QSO/LIRG com-
posite object, Mrk 231, in the transitional phase emerging out
of the dust. According to the differences in both the degree
of dust extinction and the mid- and far-infrared SED shape
between J1634+2049 and Mrk 231, J1634+2049 should be at
the phase immediately after Mrk 231 in the co-evolutionary
sequence. So it is a rare object for us to detailedly and quanti-
tatively study (or test) the co-evolution scenario of galaxy and
SMBH. In particular, taking the advantage of its nearness, we
will carry out spatially-resolved observations of the cold gas
distribution and kinematics on the circum-galactic scale (by,
e.g., JVLA), or even on the scale within the host galaxy (by,
e.g., ALMA), to directly investigate the cold gas—the vital,
starring actor playing in the (co-)evolutionary scenario.

FIG. 4.— Detailed decomposition for continuum of J1634+2049 in the rest-frame wavelength range from 3000 Å to 3 µm. Black solid line is the combined
spectrum of SDSS (3350-8150 Å), DBSP (2900-9200 Å) and TripleSpec spectrum (8600 Å-2.2 µm). The common part of the three spectra were weighted by
spectral signal to noise (S/N). Blue solid dots are ﬂuxes of u, g, r, i, z bands in 3′′ measured from SDSS images (see §2.3). Green and purple diamonds shows
the decomposition of PSF and Sérsic components in 3 ′′ decomposed from SDSS images respectively. Orange and brown dots are the photometry ﬂuxes from
2MASS J, H, K and WISE W1 bands. All the spectrum and photometry data are corrected for Galactic reddening and redshift. Green solid line represents the
power law component reddened by LMC extinction curve with EB- V = 0.41, and the gray line represents the black body continuum from hot dust (torus) with a
temperature of 1394 K. The magenta line shows the continuum of the old stellar population (age ∼ 9 Gyr), the violet line shows the heavily reddened continuum
of the young stellar population (age ∼ 127 Myr; EB- V = 2.2), and the blue solid line shows the sum ﬂux of the old and the young stellar population.

models, and the lower three panels show the models added the effects of dust grains mixed in the gas slab. Red and blue dashed lines represent the contours of
ionic column densities of He I* and Na I. Red and blue shaded regions represent the locus of points (NH, U) able to reproduce the observed NHe I∗ and NNa I with
1-σ error respectively. Purple and green dot-dashed lines represent a upper limit on the ionic column densities of H(n=2) and Ca II. Correspondingly, purple and
green doted lines represent the upper limit minus 3 σ error of H(n=2) and Ca II, which indicate the conﬁdence interval of the upper limit and also the decreasing
direction of the ionic column density. The best models are marked by an open square with the systemic on the solution.

a The Lbol here is calculated from UV-soft SED used in CLOUDY models, which corresponds to the estimated
hydrogen-ionizing photons (QH) used to estimated the distance of outﬂows. The Lbol in this table is basically
consistent with the Lbol calculated from λLλ(5100).
b The grid with nH = 104 cm- 3 is on the edge of the acceptable parameter space.
