Combining new gravitational waveforms derived by long-term (14–16 orbits) numerical-relativity
simulations with waveforms by an eﬀective-one-body (EOB) formalism for coalescing binary neutron
stars, we construct hybrid waveforms and estimate the measurability for the dimensionless tidal
deformability of the neutron stars, Λ, by advanced gravitational-wave detectors. We focus on the
equal-mass case with the total mass 2.7M⊙. We ﬁnd that for an event at a hypothetical eﬀective
distance of Deﬀ = 200 Mpc, the distinguishable diﬀerence in the dimensionless tidal deformability
will be ≈ 100, 400, and 800 at 1-σ, 2-σ, and 3-σ levels, respectively, for advanced LIGO. If the true
equation of state is stiﬀ and the typical neutron-star radius is R & 13 km, our analysis suggests that
the radius will be constrained within ≈ 1 km at 2-σ level for an event at Deﬀ = 200 Mpc. On the
other hand, if the true equation of state is soft and the typical neutron-star radius is R . 12 km,
it will be diﬃcult to narrow down the equation of state among many soft ones, although it is still
possible to discriminate the true one from stiﬀ equations of state with R & 13 km. We also ﬁnd
that gravitational waves from binary neutron stars will be distinguished from those from spinless
binary black holes at more than 2-σ level for an event at Deﬀ = 200 Mpc. The validity of the EOB
formalism, Taylor-T4, and Taylor-F2 approximants as the inspiral waveform model is also examined.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The inspiral and merger of coalescing compact bi-
naries are the most promising sources for ground-
based kilometer-size laser-interferometric gravitational-
wave detectors [1–4]. Among them, the advanced LIGO
started the ﬁrst observational run from September in
2015 [2] and has achieved the ﬁrst direct detection of
gravitational waves from the merger of a binary black
hole [5]. We may expect that these gravitational-wave
detectors will also detect the signals of gravitational
waves from binary-neutron-star mergers in a few years
because the latest statistical studies suggest that these
gravitational-wave detectors will observe gravitational
waves from merger events as frequently as ∼ 1–100/yr
if the designed sensitivity is achieved [6–8]. One of the
primary purposes after the ﬁrst detection of gravitational
waves from binary neutron stars (and also a black hole-
neutron star binary) will be to extract information of
the neutron-star equation of state, which is still poorly
constrained [9].

Extracting the tidal deformability of the neutron stars
from gravitational waves emitted by binary-neutron-star
inspirals is one of the most promising methods for con-
straining the neutron-star equation of state [10–21]. For
this purpose, we need an accurate theoretical template
of gravitational waves from binary-neutron-star inspirals
taking into account tidal-deformation eﬀects that inﬂu-
ence the dynamics of the late inspiral orbits and modify
the corresponding gravitational waveform. However, cur-
rent post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms are not appropri-

ate for the theoretical template as Favata [18] and Yagi
and Yunes [19] independently showed that uncertainties
in the known PN waveforms can cause signiﬁcant system-
atic errors in the tidal deformability estimates due to the
unknown higher-order terms. In fact, Wade and his col-
laborators [20] evaluated the systematic errors using the
waveforms derived from diﬀerent PN families and con-
ﬁrmed that the estimated tidal deformability can be sig-
niﬁcantly biased. To derive an accurate theoretical tem-
plate that is free from such uncertainties, high-accuracy
numerical-relativity simulations are necessary. Several
eﬀorts for this purpose have been done recently [22–30].

In our previous paper [27], we reported our latest ef-
fort for deriving accurate gravitational waveforms from
inspiraling binary neutron stars of typical mass (1.35–
1.35M⊙). We performed simulations for 15–16 inspiral
orbits (30–32 wave cycles) up to the merger employing
low-eccentricity initial data, then performed an extrap-
olation procedure with respect to the grid resolution,
and ﬁnally derived waveforms with the total accumu-
lated phase error within ∼ 0.5 radian and amplitude er-
ror less than 2–3%. We then compared our numerical
waveforms with the waveforms derived in an eﬀective-
one-body (EOB) formalism, developed by Damour, Na-
gar, and their collaborators [28] (see also Refs. [15, 31–
35]). We have indicated that the EOB results agree well
with the numerical-relativity results for a quite soft equa-
tion of state in which the neutron-star radius is small
(∼ 11 km), while for a stiﬀ equation of state with the
radius & 13.5 km, a slight disagreement is present for the
ﬁnal inspiral stage just prior to the merger.

Combining numerical-relativity waveforms and re-
summed PN waveforms (by a Taylor-T4 approximant),
Read and her collaborators constructed hybrid wave-
forms and analyzed the measurability of the tidal de-
formability for the ﬁrst time [16]. The primary purpose
of our paper is to quantitatively update their previous
results by performing the same analysis as theirs using
our new numerical waveforms. The motivation for this
comes from the fact that the quality of our numerical
waveforms is signiﬁcantly improved: (i) the cycles of the
new waveforms are double of those of the waveforms pre-
viously used, (ii) the initial orbital eccentricity is reduced
by more than an order of magnitude [36], and (iii) the
convergence of the simulation results is much better and
the numerical error is much lower than the previous re-
sults.

As a ﬁrst step for constructing hybrid waveforms, we
will compare new numerical gravitational waveforms for
several equations of state (diﬀerent from those employed
in our previous papers) with the EOB waveforms, and
will reconﬁrm the conclusion in our previous paper [27].
Then, we will analyze the measurability of the tidal de-
formability using the new hybrid waveforms constructed
by combining the numerical-relativity and EOB results.
In this paper, we focus only on the measurability by
ground-based advanced gravitational-wave detectors.

By comparing the hybrid waveforms derived from the
numerical and EOB results with them, we also examine
the validity of other analytic/semi-analytic methods for
modeling gravitational waveforms, paying special atten-
tion to Taylor-T4 (TT4) and Taylor-F2 (TF2) approxi-
mants in which the tidal correction is incorporated up to
the ﬁrst PN order (e.g., see Ref. [20]). We will indicate
that the current version of these Taylor approximants
does not yield waveforms as accurately as those by an
EOB formalism for equal-mass binary neutron stars, pri-
marily because of the lack of the higher-order PN terms.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we brieﬂy
summarize the formulation and numerical schemes em-
ployed in our numerical-relativity study, and also list
the equations of state employed. In Sec. III, we present
our new waveforms and compare them with those by the
EOB and TT4 approximants. We then construct hybrid
waveforms using the numerical and EOB waveforms. In
Sec. IV, we explore the measurability of the tidal de-
formability using the hybrid waveforms. We also assess
the validity of the EOB, TT4 (hybrid-TT4), and TF2 ap-
proximants for modeling inspiraling binary neutron stars.
Section V is devoted to a summary. Throughout this pa-
per, we employ the geometrical units of c = G = 1 where
c and G are the speed of light and the gravitational con-
stant, respectively.

II. DERIVING NUMERICAL WAVEFORMS

We brieﬂy summarize the formulation and numerical
schemes of our numerical-relativity simulation, equations

of state employed, and a method for deriving an extrap-
olated gravitational waveform from the raw numerical-
relativity results.

A. Evolution and initial condition

We follow the inspiral, merger, and early stage of the
post-merger of binary neutron stars using our numerical-
relativity code, SACRA, for which the details are de-
scribed in Ref.
[37]. As in our previous long-term
simulations [27], we employ a moving puncture ver-
sion of the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura for-
malism [38], locally incorporating a Z4c-type constraint
propagation prescription [39] (see Ref. [36] for our imple-
mentation) for a solution of Einstein’s equation. SACRA
implements a fourth-order ﬁnite diﬀerencing scheme in
space and time with an adaptive mesh reﬁnement (AMR)
algorithm.

As in Ref. [27], we prepare nine reﬁnement levels and
thirteen domains for the AMR algorithm. Each re-
ﬁnement domain consists of a uniform, vertex-centered
Cartesian grid with (2N + 1, 2N + 1, N + 1) grid points
for (x, y, z); the equatorial plane symmetry at z = 0 is im-
posed. The half of the edge length of the largest domain
(i.e., the distance from the origin to outer boundaries
along each axis) is denoted by L, which is chosen to be
larger than λ0, where λ0 = π/Ω0 is the initial wavelength
of gravitational waves and Ω0 is the initial orbital angu-
lar velocity. The grid spacing for each reﬁnement level
is ∆xl = L/(2lN ) where l = 0 − 8. We denote ∆x8 by
∆x in the following. In this work, we choose N = 72, 60,
and 48 for examining the convergence properties of nu-
merical results with respect to the grid resolution. With
the highest grid resolution (for N = 72), the semimajor
diameter of each neutron star is covered by about 120
grid points.

We prepare binary neutron stars in quasi-circular or-
bits for the initial condition of numerical simulations.
The initial conditions are numerically obtained by using
a spectral-method library, LORENE [40]. In this paper,
we focus only on equal-mass systems with each neutron-
star mass 1.35M⊙. We follow 14–16 orbits in this study
(≈ 57–62 ms duration for the last inspiral orbits). To do
so, the orbital angular velocity of the initial conﬁgura-
tion is chosen to be m0Ω0 ≈ 0.0155 (f = Ω0/π ≈ 371 Hz
for the total mass m0 = 2.7M⊙ where f denotes the
gravitational-wave frequency). Some of parameters for
the models and setting for the simulations are listed in
Table I.

For the computation of an accurate gravitational wave-
form in numerical simulations, we have to employ ini-
tial data of a quasi-circular orbit of negligible eccentric-
ity. Such initial data are constructed by an eccentricity-
reduction procedure described in Ref. [36]. For the initial
data employed in this work, the residual eccentricity is
. 10−3.

resolution runs. m0 denotes the total mass of the system for the inﬁnite orbital separation. In this study, m0 = 2.7M⊙. For
m0Ω0 ≈ 0.0155, the corresponding gravitational-wave frequency is ≈ 371 Hz.

B. Equation of state

phases. For this prescription, we use the same method as
that used in our previous works (see, e.g., Refs. [27, 47]).

We employ four tabulated equations of state for zero-
temperature neutron-star matter derived recently by
Hempel and his collaborators, and we refer to them as
SFHo [41], DD2 [42], TMA [43], and TM1 [43]. Here,
TM1 employed the same parameter set of a relativistic
mean-ﬁeld theory as that of one of Shen equations of
state [44]. All these equations of state have been de-
rived in relativistic mean ﬁeld theories. Some character-
istic properties resulting from these equations of state are
listed in Table I. For all of them, the predicted maximum
mass for spherical neutron stars is larger than the largest
well-measured mass of neutron stars, ≈ 2M⊙ [45]. The
neutron-star radius with mass 1.35M⊙, R1.35, is ≈ 11.9,
13.2, 13.9 and 14.5 km for SFHo, DD2, TMA, and TM1;
i.e., these are soft, moderately stiﬀ, stiﬀ, and very stiﬀ
equations of state, respectively.

In our previous works [25, 27], we employed piece-wise
polytropic equations of state approximating tabulated
equations of state.
In this work, we employ the tabu-
lated equations of state as it is for preserving the original
form of each equation of state.

In the analysis for the measurability of the dimension-
less tidal deformability, Λ, we also employ the numeri-
cal results for APR4 [46], for which a detailed numerical
result has been already reported in Ref. [27]. For this
numerical simulation, we employed the piece-wise poly-
tropic approximation. R1.35 for this equations of state is
≈ 11.1 km, and hence, this equation of state is softer than
SFHo, DD2, TMA, and TM1. As Table I shows, R1.35
and Λ are systematically varied among the ﬁve equations
of state employed. This is the reason that we pick up
these equations of state in our present analysis for the
measurability of Λ.

For the zero-temperature case, the thermodynamical
quantities, i.e., the pressure, P , and the speciﬁc inter-
nal energy, ε, are written as functions of the rest-mass
density, ρ. Here, the zero-temperature equations of state
satisfy dε = −P d(1/ρ).
In numerical simulations, we
slightly modify the original equations of state, adding a
thermal part, to approximately take into account thermal
eﬀects, which play a role in the merger and post-merger

C. Extraction of gravitational waves and

extrapolation procedures

Gravitational waves are extracted from the outgoing-
component of complex Weyl scalar Ψ4 [37]. Ψ4 can be
expanded in the form

Ψ4(t, r, θ, ϕ) =Xlm

Ψl,m

4

(t, r)−2Ylm(θ, ϕ),

(2.1)

where −2Ylm(θ, ϕ) denotes the spin-weighted spherical
harmonics of weight −2 and Ψl,m
are expansion coeﬃ-
cients deﬁned by this equation. In this work, we focus
only on the (l, |m|) = (2, 2) mode because we pay at-
tention only to the equal-mass binary, and hence, this
quadrupole mode is the dominant one.

4

From the (l, m) = (2, 2) mode, quadrupole gravita-

tional waveforms are determined by

h+(t, r) − ih×(t, r) = − lim

r→∞Z t

dt′Z t′

dt′′Ψ2,2

4 (t′′, r),

(2.2)

where h+(t, r) and h×(t, r) are the plus and cross modes
of quadrupole gravitational waves, respectively (note
that the waveforms h+ and h× are actually derived by
the integration method of Ref. [48]: see also Ref. [27, 36]).
We evaluate Ψ4 at a ﬁnite spherical-coordinate radius,
r ≈ 200m0, following Ref. [27]. The waveforms are de-
scribed as a function of the retarded time deﬁned by

tret := t − r∗,

(2.3)

where r∗ is the so-called tortoise coordinate deﬁned by

r∗ := rA + 2m0 ln(cid:18) rA

2m0

− 1(cid:19) ,

(2.4)

with rA := pA/4π and A the proper area of the ex-

traction sphere: For simplicity we deﬁne it by rA =
r[1 + m0/(2r)]2.

Since the waveform of Ψ2,2

extracted at a ﬁnite ra-
dius, r = r0, is systematically diﬀerent from that at null
inﬁnity, we then compute an extrapolated waveform at
r0 → ∞ using the Nakano’s method as [49, 50]

4

Ψl,m,∞

(tret, r0) = C(r0)(cid:20)Ψl,m

Z tret

Ψl,m

4

(t′, r0)dt′(cid:21),

(2.5)

where C(r0) = 1 − 2m0/rA as described in Ref. [27].

As we already mentioned, we always perform simula-
tions for three diﬀerent grid resolutions (with diﬀerent
values of the grid spacing ∆x), and obtain three wave-
forms of diﬀerent accuracy determined by ∆x. Then, we
perform an extrapolation procedure for ∆x → 0 employ-
ing the same method as described in Ref. [27]. As in
the previous results, we found that the convergence or-
der is within 4 ± 1 irrespective of the equations of state
employed.

It should be noted that the extrapolated numerical
waveforms have the accumulated phase errors only within
∼ 0.5 radian as described in Ref. [27]. This value is much
smaller than the phase diﬀerences among the diﬀerent
waveforms by diﬀerent modeling (see Sec. IV B). There-
fore, we expect that the numerical errors in our extrap-
olated waveforms do not change signiﬁcantly our results
for the analysis of the measurability described in Sec. IV.

III. CONSTRUCTING HYBRID WAVEFORM

Because we follow only 14–16 inspiral orbits, gravita-
tional waveforms only with f & 370 Hz can be derived.
For exploring the measurability of the tidal deformability,
such waveforms are not well-suited. To supplement the
earlier waveform for f < 370 Hz, we consider hybridiza-
tion between the numerical waveform and a waveform de-
rived by an analytic/semi-analytic calculation, by which
the waveform for the lower-frequency band is ﬁlled up.

For the hybridization, we ﬁrst have to align the time
and phase of the numerical-relativity waveform, hNR,
and a waveform by an analytic/semi-analytic formula-
tion, hSA. Here, complex waveforms h(t) are deﬁned by
h+(t) − ih×(t) with h+(t) and h×(t) the plus and cross
modes, respectively. We then calculate

I(τ, φ) =Z tf

ti

dt(cid:12)(cid:12)hNR(t) − hSA(t + τ )eiφ(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

,

(3.1)

and search for τ and φ that minimize I. Here, t in this
section always denotes the retarded time, tret, and we
choose ti = 5 ms and tf = 20 ms as in our previous pa-
per [27]. At t = 5 ms and 20 ms, the gravitational-wave
frequency is f ≈ 380 Hz and 420 Hz, respectively (see
Fig. 7 in Appendix A), and the number of the wave cy-
cle in this duration is ∼ 6 (see Fig. 1). We choose this
window because we would like to employ the time for it

4

as early as possible. Here, for the ﬁrst ≈ 5 ms just af-
ter the simulations started, the waveforms have unphys-
ical modulation, and hence, we choose 5 ms for ti. 20 ms
for tf is rather ad hoc. To check that our conclusion
for the measurability of the tidal deformability does not
depend strongly on the choice of ti and tf , we also con-
struct another hybrid waveforms choosing ti = 10 ms and
tf = 25 ms (f ≈ 390 Hz and 430 Hz, respectively) and use
them for calibrating the results in Sec. IV A.

For the values of τ and φ that we determine, we con-
struct a hybrid waveform. Following Refs. [27, 51], we
deﬁne the hybrid waveform by

hhyb(t)

=


hSA(t′)eiφ
hNR(t)H(t) + hSA(t′)eiφ[1 − H(t)]
hNR(t)

t ≤ ti,

ti ≤ t ≤ tf ,

t ≥ tf ,

(3.2)

where t′ = t + τ , and we choose a Hann window function
for H(t) as

H(t) :=

1

2(cid:20)1 − cos(cid:18)π

t − ti

tf − ti(cid:19)(cid:21) .

(3.3)

Figure 1 plots the extrapolated numerical waveforms
and waveforms by an EOB formalism [29] for four dif-
ferent equations of state (see Fig. 3 and Appendix A of
Ref. [27] for the waveform with APR4 and for the EOB
formalism that we employ in this work, respectively). For
these plots, we align the numerical and EOB waveforms
in the same way as the hybrid construction. It is found
that the two waveforms agree well with each other in
their early part, i.e., for tret . 45 ms (for the ﬁrst ∼ 20
wave cycles). In particular, the phases for the two wave-
forms agree with each other with the disagreement of
order 0.01 rad for this stage, as we demonstrated in our
previous work [27]. This suggests that our hybridization
would work well whenever we employ the EOB wave-
forms irrespective of the choice of (ti, tf ) as long as they
are suﬃciently small ≪ 45 ms. We estimate a degree of
the disagreement in the matching window by




ti

R tf

minτ,φ I(τ, φ)

dtn|hNR(t)|2 + |hSA(t)|2o

1/2




,

(3.4)

and it is always small as . 2 × 10−2. This error comes
primarily from the error in amplitude of the numerical
waveforms because the estimated maximum error size is
2–3% in the amplitude. On the other hand, the phase
error has a minor contribution for this error.

The numerical and EOB waveforms agree reasonably
well with each other even in the late inspiral phase, up
to a few wave cycles prior to the merger (see also Fig. 7
in Appendix A for supplementary information). This in-
dicates that the tidal-deformation eﬀects would be fairly
well taken into account in the employed EOB formal-
ism as we already mentioned in Ref. [27]. Due to these

FIG. 1. Comparison of numerical (solid curves) and EOB (dot-dot curves) waveforms for the late inspiral phase. Upper left,
upper right, lower left, and lower right panels show the results for SFHo, DD2, TMA, and TM1, respectively. Gravitational
waves (plus mode) observed along the rotational axis (perpendicular to the orbital plane) are shown. D denotes the distance
from the source to the observer.

reasons, we construct hybrid waveforms employing the
EOB waveforms as hSA and use them for analyzing the
measurability of the tidal deformability.

We note that for stiﬀ equations of state like TMA and
TM1 for which the dimensionless tidal deformability is
larger than 1000, the disagreement between the numeri-
cal and EOB waveforms are appreciable for the last few
wave cycles, as already pointed out in Ref. [27]. This
suggests that there is still a room for incorporating addi-
tional tidal eﬀects into the EOB formalism [52]. On the
other hand, for softer equations of state with Λ < 1000,
the disagreement is minor. This indicates that the EOB
waveforms well capture the tidal-deformation eﬀects as
long as Λ ≪ 1000.

We also perform the hybridization employing the TT4
waveforms [53, 54] incorporating the tidal eﬀects up to
the ﬁrst PN (1PN) order [14]. In the TT4 approximant,
the evolution of the gravitational-wave frequency is de-

termined by (see, e.g., Ref. [20])

where x(t) := [πm0f (t)]2/3 and γE is the Euler’s con-
stant. We assume that the quadrupole-wave amplitude
is determined by Eq. (71) of Ref. [55]. Here, for simplic-
ity, we restrict our attention only to the equal-mass case,
and in addition, we do not take into account the eﬀect of
the tidal deformability in the amplitude because it plays
only a minor role for analyzing the measurability [32].

After the alignment procedure for time and phase, we
also compare the numerical waveforms with the TT4

parison as in Fig. 1. This shows that the agreement be-
tween the numerical and TT4 waveforms is worse than
that between the numerical and EOB waveforms. Specif-

slower than that in the EOB formalism. We note that
the tidal eﬀects accelerate the orbital evolution in the
late inspiral phase because the tidal force strengthens
the attractive force between two neutron stars for such
orbits. Thus, we conclude that the tidal eﬀects are un-
derestimated in the employed TT4 approximant. This
should be the case not only for the very late inspiral phase
but also for the earlier inspiral phase. An analysis of
the gravitational-wave phase evolution indicates that this
would be due to the lack of the higher-order PN terms
of order O(x13/2) or more: terms with more than 1.5PN
order with respect to the leading-order tidal-deformation
eﬀect. We indicate evidence for this in Appendix B. By
this reason, we suppose that the EOB formalism could
give a better waveform than the TT4 formalism.

Figure 3 plots the Fourier spectra of the hybrid wave-
forms (numerical plus EOB waveforms) together with a
designed noise curve of the advanced LIGO, S1/2
(for
“Zero Detuning High Power” conﬁguration) [56] and with
the spectrum of a binary-black-hole merger of mass 1.35–
1.35M⊙. Here, Sn(f ) denotes the one-sided noise spec-
trum density of gravitational-wave detectors. The nu-
merical waveform for the binary black hole is taken from
SXS Gravitational Waveform Database [57] and we em-
ploy SXS:BBH:001. In this paper, the Fourier transform
is deﬁned by

n

˜h(f ) :=Z dt h+(t) exp(−2πif t),

(3.6)

where h+(t) denotes the plus-mode gravitational wave-
form. For binary neutron stars, the overall shape of h×(t)

is approximately the same as that of h+(t) except for a
π/2 phase diﬀerence, and hence, the Fourier transforma-
tion of the cross mode, h×(t), results approximately in
−i˜h(f ).

The response of gravitational-wave detectors for a
gravitational-wave event of coalescing binary neutron
stars is written in the form

¯h(t) = H+(θ, ϕ, ι, ψp)h+(t) + H×(θ, ϕ, ι, ψp)h×(t),

(3.7)

where H+ and H× are functions of the source angular
direction denoted by (θ, ϕ), of the inclination angle of
the binary orbital plane with respect to the line of the
sight to the source denoted by ι, and of the polarization
angle denoted by ψp. Thus, the Fourier transformation
of ¯h(t) is written as

¯h(f ) ≈ H(θ, ϕ, ι, ψp)˜h(f ),

(3.8)

where H = H+ − iH× for which |H| ≤ 1. Taking into
account this form, we deﬁne the eﬀective distance to the
source by Deﬀ := D|H|−1 where D is the proper distance
to the source. In the following, we always refer to Deﬀ
(not to D) as “the eﬀective distance to the source”, and
we typically consider an event at Deﬀ = 200 Mpc: This is
equivalent of an event at a distance of 200 Mpc with the
optimal orientation and sky location. The reason for this
choice is that statistical studies have predicted typically
∼ 1 detection per year for Deﬀ . 200 Mpc [58].

Figure 3 clearly shows that the diﬀerence in the Fourier
spectra among the waveforms of diﬀerent equations of

FIG. 3. Fourier spectra of the hybrid waveforms for ﬁve diﬀerent equations of state for a hypothetical eﬀective distance of
Deﬀ = 100 Mpc. The dot-dot curve for the advanced LIGO (referrer to as aLIGO) denotes S 1/2

spectrum density for the “Zero Detuning High Power” conﬁguration [56]. The dot-dot-dot curve denotes the Fourier spectrum

state becomes appreciable for f & 500 Hz. In particular,
for f & 700 Hz, the diﬀerence is remarkable. This stems
primarily from the diﬀerence in the tidal deformability:
For the larger values of Λ, the spectrum amplitude more
steeply decreases for f & 700 Hz because the binary orbit
is evolved faster. Here, we note that (i) the late inspiral
waveform determines the spectrum only for f . 1 kHz,
(ii) the ﬁnal-inspiral to merger waveform determines the
spectrum approximately for 1 kHz. f . 2 kHz, and (iii)
several bumps and peaks for f & 2 kHz are determined
by the post-merger waveform (i.e., by gravitational waves
from remnant massive neutron stars formed after the
merger). It should be also noted that the noise ampli-
tude of the gravitational-wave detectors monotonically
increases for f & 500 Hz. This indicates that the equa-
tion of state (tidal deformability) could be constrained
primarily by analyzing the spectrum in the late inspiral
and merger waveforms and that the tidal deformability
could be more accurately measured for stiﬀer equations
of state of a larger value of Λ.

We brieﬂy comment on the strength of gravitational
waves found for 2–3.5 kHz as peaks of the Fourier spec-
trum, which are emitted from the massive neutron stars
formed in the post-merger phase (see, e.g., Ref. [47]). To
assess the detectability for them, we estimate the signal-
to-noise ratio deﬁned by

SNR ="4Z ff

fi

|˜h(f )|2
Sn(f )

df#1/2

.

(3.9)

For evaluating the strength of the peaks, we choose

fi = 2 kHz and ff = 4 kHz and the one-sided noise spec-
trum density for the “Zero Detuning High Power” conﬁg-
uration of advanced LIGO as Sn(f ) [56]. It is found that
SNR is 0.5–0.9 for Deﬀ = 200 Mpc: For stiﬀer equations
of state, this value is larger (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9, and 0.9
for APR4, SFHo, DD2, TMA, and TM1). Since SNR& 5
would be required for the conﬁrmed detection (due to
the presence of the Gaussian and other noises in the de-
tectors; see, e.g., Ref. [59]), this peak will be detected
with a high conﬁdence level only for a nearby event with
Deﬀ . 20–35 Mpc for the advanced-LIGO-class detec-
tors, even if perfect templates for this waveform could be
prepared. We note that for a gravitational-wave event of
equal-mass binary neutron star with m0 = 2.7M⊙ and
Deﬀ = 200 Mpc, the total signal-to-noise ratio for the en-
tire inspiral phase will be ≈ 17 (for a choice of fi < 10 Hz
and ff > 2 kHz) irrespective of the equations of state em-
ployed. Therefore, the expected SNR for the kHz-peaks
is much lower than the SNR for the inspiral signal for the
advanced-LIGO-class detectors. This motivates us to fo-
cus primarily on the late inspiral phase for extracting the
information of the neutron-star equation of state at least
in the near future. (Of course, detectability of this peak
will be more optimistic with more sensitive gravitational-
wave detectors in the future.)

IV. MEASURABILITY OF THE TIDAL

DEFORMABILITY

f ≥ 2 kHz is minor, and hence, the results for ||h1 − h2||
with fi = 2 kHz and 4 kHz are approximately identical
(see Sec. IV A and Appendix C).

Following Ref. [16], we deﬁne a measure of the distin-

guishability of two waveforms by

||h1 − h2||2

(4.1)
where ˜h1(f ) and ˜h2(f ) are the Fourier transform of the
waveforms h1(t) and h2(t). fi and ff are carefully chosen
later for the analysis of the measurability. In the follow-
ing, we always employ the one-sided noise spectrum den-
sity for the “Zero Detuning High Power” conﬁguration of
advanced LIGO as Sn(f ) [56].

As shown in Ref. [60], ||h1 − h2|| = 1 corresponds to a
1-σ error in parameter estimation, and hence, two wave-
forms h1 and h2 are said to be marginally distinguishable
if ||h1 −h2|| = 1. Thus, we assess the measurability of the
tidal deformability by calculating ||h1 − h2|| for a variety
of waveform combinations.

i

In the calculation of ||h1 − h2||, it is ideal to choose
fi < 10 Hz and ff > 4 kHz. Computationally, choos-
ing ff > 4 kHz does not matter whereas choosing the
low value of fi is expensive because the data size for the
waveforms increases approximately as f −8/3
. Here, we
should keep in mind that the noise amplitude of ground-
based gravitational-wave detectors steeply increases with
the decrease of the frequency for f < 50 Hz toward 10 Hz.
Hence, it is practically possible to obtain an approximate
result for ||h1 − h2|| even if we choose a value of fi that is
larger than 10 Hz. Thus, as a ﬁrst step, we calibrated how
high value of fi would be acceptable analyzing ||h1 − h2||
by using a TF2 approximant for ˜h1 and ˜h2. Here, the
amplitude and phase of the TF2 approximant are cal-
culated by using a stationary phase approximation and
the results are written simply in a polynomial form with
respect to (πm0f )2/3 [54] (see also Appendix C). In the
present analysis, the tidal eﬀect is incorporated up to the
1PN order as in the TT4 case.

It is found (see Appendix C for the results) that for
fi = 30 and 50 Hz, the results for ||h1 − h2|| are not sig-
niﬁcantly diﬀerent from that for fi = 10 Hz: the values of
||h1−h2|| are systematically underestimated by ≈ 5% and
15% for fi = 30 and 50 Hz, respectively: see Appendix C.
For fi = 100 Hz, the values of ||h1 − h2|| are underesti-
mated by up to ∼ 30%. (We note that for fi = 10, 30, 50,
and 100 Hz with ff = 4 kHz, SNR of Eq. (3.9) is ≈ 17,
16, 13, and 9 for Deﬀ = 200 Mpc.) Thus, in this paper,
we employ fi = 30 Hz for the analysis of the measura-
bility of the tidal deformability performed in Sec. IV A
and fi = 50 Hz for the calibration of the several model
waveforms (see Sec. IV B).

For ff , we choose 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz. As we
already mentioned, the contribution to the SNR from

A. Analysis with the hybrid waveforms

Table II lists the values of ||h1 − h2|| for all the combi-
nation of the hybrid waveforms with the ﬁve equations of
state for an event of Deﬀ = 200 Mpc. Figure 4 also plots
||h1 − h2|| as a function of δΛ = |Λ1 − Λ2| for fi = 30 Hz
or 50 Hz and ff = 4 kHz. Here, δΛ denotes the absolute
value in the diﬀerence of the dimensionless tidal deforma-
bility of two diﬀerent equations of state. Table II shows
that the values of ||h1 − h2|| depend very weakly on the
value of ff as long as it is larger than 2 kHz. Further-
more, for ff = 2 and 4 kHz, the values of ||h1 − h2||
are only slightly [by (0.1–0.4)×(Deﬀ/200 Mpc)−1] larger
than those for ff = 1 kHz. It is also found that the dif-
ference is large for the combination of two soft equations
of state. All these results agree totally with the results in
Appendix C, and hence, we may conclude that they hold
universally irrespective of the model waveforms. From
these results, we conﬁrm that the measurability is deter-
mined primarily by the late inspiral waveform, and the
contribution of the merger and post-merger waveforms is
minor.

Table II also shows that for given combination of two
waveforms, the values for fi = 50 Hz are by ∼ 10%
smaller than those for fi = 30 Hz. This also agrees
quantitatively with the results in the analysis in terms of
Taylor-F2 approximant (see Appendix C), and hence, we
could suppose that the values of ||h1 − h2|| for fi = 30 Hz
would be only by ∼ 5% smaller than those for fi = 10 Hz.
Nevertheless, they depend slightly on the value of fi.
This implies that the measurability of the tidal eﬀect
is determined not only by the late inspiral waveform but
also by the relatively early one.

We also calculated ||h1 − h2|| using another hybrid
see
waveforms derived with (ti, tf ) =(10 ms, 25 ms):
Eq. (3.1). We conﬁrmed that the results depend only
weakly on the choice of ti and tf : Speciﬁcally, the change
in the values of ||h1 − h2|| shown in Table II is within 0.1
irrespective of the waveforms.

Figure 4 shows that for δΛ & 100, 400, and 800,
||h1 − h2|| is larger than 1, 2, and 3, respectively, for
Deﬀ = 200 Mpc (note that if fi = 10 Hz, the values of
||h1 − h2|| would be by ∼ 5% and 15% larger than those
for fi = 30 Hz and 50 Hz, respectively: see Appendix C).
This implies that for an event of Deﬀ = 200 Mpc, two
equations of state are marginally distinguishable by the
observation of inspiral and merger waveforms by ad-
vanced gravitational-wave detectors if δΛ & 100.

The neutron-star radius approximately monotonically
increases with Λ. For the ﬁve equations of state em-
ployed in this paper, the radius of 1.35M⊙ neutron stars

for which the total SNR would be ≈ 17 for our choice of Sn (for fi . 10 Hz and ff & 4 kHz). The left and right tables show
the results for fi = 30 and 50 Hz, respectively. For the top, second, and third tables, ff = 1, 2, and 4 kHz, respectively. Note
that the listed values are proportional to 200 Mpc/Deﬀ and for fi = 30 Hz and 50 Hz, the values for given combination of two
waveforms would be smaller than those for fi = 10 Hz by ≈ 5% and 15%, respectively (see Appendix C).

where the standard errors shown for this ﬁtting formula
are at 1-σ level. By taking the variation, the relative
diﬀerence in the radius, δR1.35, is related to δΛ by

δR1.35 = (0.91 ± 0.05) km(cid:18) R1.35

(4.3)

For stiﬀ equations of state that yield a large neutron-
star radius of R1.35 & 13.5 km, i.e., Λ & 1000, δΛ for two
diﬀerent equations of state can become larger than ∼ 400
if the diﬀerence in R1.35 is larger than ≈ 0.9 km. Thus,
if the true equation of state is stiﬀ, the equation of state
will be strongly constrained for an event of the advanced
detectors at Deﬀ . 200 Mpc, by which the measurability
of δΛ is ≈ 400 at 2-σ level.

By contrast, among soft equations of state, the diﬀer-
ence in Λ is not as large as 400 (for the typical neutron-
star mass 1.30–1.40M⊙). For example, δΛ for APR4 and
SFHo equations of state is ∼ 100 although the diﬀerence
in radius is ≈ 0.8 km for neutron stars of mass 1.35M⊙
in these equations of state. This implies that it will not
be easy to accurately identify the true equation of state

among many candidate soft equations of state for a typi-
cal advanced-LIGO event at Deﬀ = 200 Mpc. The reason
for this is quite simple: The phase diﬀerence between two
waveforms for two diﬀerent soft equations of state can be
appreciable only for a high-frequency range of & 1 kHz,
for which the sensitivity of the operating and planned
gravitational-wave detectors is not very high (see Fig. 3).
This situation cannot be signiﬁcantly improved even if we
take into account the merger and post-merger waveform,
because gravitational waves in these phases have a high
frequency, and do not contribute a lot to enhancing the
signal-to-noise ratio, as shown in Table II. However, even
if the true equation of state is soft, it will be still possible
to discriminate it from stiﬀ equations of state that yield
Λ & 1000. Thus, the detection of gravitational waves
emitted at Deﬀ . 200 Mpc for the advanced detectors
will give us an impact even if the true equation of state
is soft. We also should mention that if we fortunately
have a nearby event at Deﬀ ≪ 200 Mpc, the situation
will become much more optimistic.

Next, we evaluate ||h1 − h2|| employing hybrid wave-
forms for binary neutron stars and spinless binary black
holes of mass 1.35–1.35M⊙ assuming Deﬀ = 200 Mpc.
For this analysis, a hybrid waveform for the binary black
hole is constructed by combining a numerical waveform
and an EOB one as we already did for binary neutron
stars. Here, the numerical waveform is again taken from
SXS Gravitational Waveform Database [57] and we em-

ploy SXS:BBH:001. Table III lists the results of ||h1−h2||
and in Fig. 4, we plot the data setting Λ = 0 for
the black-hole case (see the crosses). These show that
||h1 − h2|| & 2 for Deﬀ = 200 Mpc irrespective of the
neutron-star equations of state we employ. This indi-
cates that gravitational waves from binary neutron stars
for Deﬀ . 200 Mpc will be distinguished from those from
binary black holes of the same mass with a certain con-
ﬁdence level.

Figure 4 also shows that the relation between ||h1−h2||
and δΛ, satisﬁed for binary neutron stars, is approxi-
mately satisﬁed even for the waveform combination of
binary neutron stars and binary black holes. This also
indicates that gravitational waves from binary neutron
stars for Deﬀ . 200 Mpc will be distinguished from those
from binary black holes at 2-σ level if the value of Λ for
the neutron stars is larger than ∼ 400.

Before closing this subsection, we note the following
point. By comparing our results with those in Ref. [16],
it is found that our results for the measurability of δΛ and
R1.35 agree approximately with theirs. However, this is

accidental. In Ref. [16], the measurability was explored
choosing fi in Eq. (4.1) to be 200 Hz while we choose it to
be 30 Hz. As found from Table II (see also Appendix C),
the values of ||h1 − h2|| systematically decrease with the
increase of fi for a given value of ff . We checked that
for fi = 200 Hz, the values of ||h1 − h2|| could be half of
those for fi = 30 Hz. This implies that our results, based
on new hybrid waveforms, actually show weaker measur-
ability than that in Ref. [16]. The precise reason is not
very clear. However, it is reasonable to speculate that in
the previous work, the numerical dissipation and the ab-
sence of any appropriate extrapolation procedure result
in spuriously shorter merger time even for the highest-
resolution runs as shown in Refs. [27, 47], so that the
tidal eﬀects could be spuriously overestimated. In addi-
tion, as noted in Ref. [16], the systematic error in their
hybrid waveforms might be non-negligible because of a
small number of the wave cycles and large initial resid-
ual eccentricity: These errors would also systematically
enhance the measurability of the tidal deformability of
Ref. [16].

B. Validity of analytic/semi-analytic waveforms

We then evaluate ||h1 − h2|| choosing the hybrid wave-
forms as h1 while the EOB, hybrid-TT4, and TF2 wave-
forms as h2, respectively. Here, as the EOB waveforms,
we only take into account the inspiral part. Note that
in the EOB formalism we employ in this paper, the
amplitude approaches zero if the orbital separation ap-
proaches zero. The “hybrid-TT4” waveforms are con-
structed by combining the numerical and TT4 wave-
forms, and then the Fourier transformation is performed

straightforwardly. The TF2 approximant that we employ
in this paper is described in Appendix C.

The purpose of this analysis is to assess how appropri-
ate the EOB/hybrid-TT4/TF2 waveforms are as inspiral
model gravitational waveforms. We note that for the
EOB and TF2 waveforms employed, the spectrum with
f & 1 kHz is not very realistic because of the absence
of the merger and post-merger waveforms, and hence, it
is not appropriate to take the higher-frequency part into
consideration for the comparison with the hybrid wave-
forms. Also, as we already showed in Sec. IV A, the val-
ues of ||h1 − h2|| for (fi, ff ) = (50 Hz, 1 kHz) are only by
∼ 0.2 smaller than those for (fi, ff ) = (30 Hz, 1 kHz) for
an event of advanced LIGO at Deﬀ = 200 Mpc. Thus, in
this section, all the analyses will be performed choosing
(fi, ff ) = (50 Hz, 1 kHz) for simplicity.

Three panels of Table IV list the values of ||h1 − h2||
for fi = 50 Hz and ff = 1 kHz for the combination of the
hybrid and other waveforms assuming Deﬀ = 200 Mpc.
From the comparison between Tables II and IV, it is
found that for APR4, SFHo, DD2, and TMA equations of
state, the EOB waveforms can reproduce approximately
the same results of ||h1 − h2|| (within the error of ±0.2)
as for the hybrid (hybrid-EOB) waveforms. This fact
makes us conﬁrm again that the EOB formalism would
have already become robust for generating accurate in-
spiral waveform templates if the neutron-star equation
of state is not very stiﬀ, i.e., Λ is smaller than ∼ 1000.
By contrast, the EOB waveforms may not be yet accu-
rate enough for neutron stars with very stiﬀ equations of
state. For TM1, this fact is in particular noticeable: It
is clearly found from the result of ||h1 − h2|| for the com-
bination of the TM1 EOB and TM1 hybrid waveforms,
which is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero. This suggests
again that for very stiﬀ equations of state, there is still a
room for improving the EOB formalism [52].

We also ﬁnd from Table IV that the values of ||h1 −h2||
for the choice of the hybrid-TT4 or TF2 waveforms are
more appreciably diﬀerent from those in Table II (except
for the APR4 and SFHo equations of state; hybrid-EOB
and hybrid-TT4 waveforms agree with each other in a
good manner for these equations of state). This fact is
also found from, e.g., (i) the diagonal components in Ta-
ble IV (i.e., for the case that h1 and h2 for the same
equation of state are employed) is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from zero, in particular for stiﬀ equations of state, (ii)
asymmetry between the oﬀ-diagonal components, which
should be absent for the templates, is more appreciable,
and (iii) the hybrid-TT4 waveform for the TM1 equation
of state matches better with the hybrid (hybrid-EOB)
waveform for the TMA than for the TM1. If the hybrid
waveforms would be more realistic ones, these results im-
ply that hybrid-TT4 and TF2 waveforms would not be
as good measurement templates as the EOB ones. This
also indicates that the templates by the TF2 and TT4
approximants would give a systematic bias in the esti-
mation of tidal deformability. This agrees qualitatively
with the ﬁnding in Ref. [20].

One of the reasons for the disagreement between two
hybrid waveforms (hybrid-EOB and hybrid-TT4) is that
the eﬀect of the tidal deformation would be underesti-
mated in the current TT4 approximant, due to the lack
of higher-order PN terms (see Sec. III and Appendix B).
Another reason is that the matching frequency in our
present study (f ∼ 400 Hz) would be still high: For such
frequency, the EOB and TT4 waveforms do not agree well
with each other for high values of Λ and the phase dif-
ference is not negligible; for stiﬀ equations of state, the
accumulated phase diﬀerence is ∼ 0.3(Λ/1000) rad for
50 Hz ≤ f ≤ 400 Hz (see Appendix B). The phase diﬀer-
ence that results from the incompleteness of the tidal ef-
fects would be proportional approximately to Λf α
f where
α ≥ 8/3 [see Appendix B and Eqs. (C3) and (C4)] and
ff is the upper end of the matching frequency. Thus, if
the hybridization is performed with a lower value of the
matching frequency, the disagreement between two hy-
brid waveforms would be smaller. Our numerical results
(compare Figs. 1 and 2) support that the EOB wave-
forms would be more accurate to perform matching at
f ∼ 400 Hz than the TT4 ones. However, to conﬁrm
these speculations, we will have to perform a longer-term
simulation and have to match the waveform at lower fre-
quency.

One reason that the current version of the TF2 approx-
imant does not reproduce the hybrid waveforms is found
from the analysis of the spectrum shape. Figure 5 plots

the Fourier spectra of the three diﬀerent models (hybrid,
pure EOB, and TF2) for SFHo, DD2, TMA, and TM1
equations of state.
In the spectrum of the EOB wave-
form, a modulation is found. This is due to the fact that
the time-domain waveform is artiﬁcially terminated at
the end of the inspiral phase and hence the spectrum is
subject to the Gibbs phenomenon. Besides this modula-
tion, the spectrum shapes of the hybrid and EOB wave-
forms are in a fair agreement for f . 1 kHz. This should
be the case because the agreement between the two wave-
forms has been already found in particular for the equa-
tions of state with Λ < 1000 (see Fig. 1). By contrast,
the spectrum amplitude of the TF2 approximant does
not agree well with those of the hybrid waveforms for the
late inspiral phase (f & 500 Hz) in which the tidal eﬀects
as well as general relativistic gravity play an important
role: The steep decline of the spectrum observed in the
hybrid waveforms for f & 500 Hz cannot be well cap-
tured by the current version of the TF2 approximant in
particular for the stiﬀ equations of state like TMA and
TM1. This indicates that the tidal eﬀects would not be
suﬃciently taken into account in this TF2 spectrum am-
plitude. (We note that this insuﬃciency is partly due to

the use of the stationary phase approximation.)

The phases of the Fourier transform in the hybrid and
TF2 waveforms also do not agree well with each other.
Figure 6 plots the absolute diﬀerence (upper panel) and
phase diﬀerence (lower panel) between the hybrid and
TF2 waveforms for given equations of state. Here the
absolute diﬀerence of the waveforms for a given value of
f is deﬁned by

|˜h1(f ) − ˜h2(f )|

2|˜h1(f )|

,

(4.4)

where ˜h1 and ˜h2 denote the Fourier transform of the hy-
brid and TF2 waveforms. For plotting Fig. 6, we choose
∆t and ∆φ that minimize ||h1 − h2|| of Eq. (4.1) for
fi = 50 Hz and ff = 1 kHz. This ﬁgure shows that the
absolute diﬀerence in the waveform is determined primar-
ily by the phase diﬀerence and that the phase diﬀerence
is generally larger for larger values of Λ. This suggests
that the absence of higher-order PN terms in the tidal-
deformation eﬀect would be one of the primary sources
for the disagreement in the phase.

We also note that the phase diﬀerence is present rather
uniformly for 50–1000 Hz even for soft equations of state

like SFHo for which the tidal-deformation eﬀect should
be minor. This suggests that the absence of not only
the tidal eﬀect but also other non-tidal higher-order PN
terms like 4PN and higher-order terms would cause inac-
curacy of the TF2 approximants. A recent study for the
extension of the TF2 approximant in the context of bi-
nary black holes [62] indeed suggests that the coeﬃcients
of the absent higher-order PN terms in phase (ψTF2: see
Appendix C) should be large (the order of αk with k ≥ 9
in Eq. (C3) would of 104 or more, i.e., comparable to the
tidal-eﬀect terms) perhaps due to the use of the station-
ary phase approximation, and this should aﬀect the wave
phase in the late inspiral stage. Therefore, for improving
the performance of the TF2 approximant, we will have
to incorporate both the tidal and non-tidal higher-order
PN terms, which are absent in the current version. We
plan to explore this issue in the future work.

V. SUMMARY

Combining new gravitational waveforms derived by
long-term (14–16 orbits) numerical-relativity simulations
with the waveforms by an EOB formalism for coalescing
binary neutron stars, we constructed hybrid waveforms
and estimated the measurability for the dimensionless
tidal deformability of the neutron stars, Λ, by ground-
based advanced gravitational-wave detectors, using the
hybrid waveforms as the model waveforms. We found
that for an event at a hypothetical eﬀective distance of
Deﬀ = 200 Mpc, the distinguishable diﬀerence in the di-
mensionless tidal deformability for 1.35M⊙ neutron stars
will be ≈ 100, 400, and 800 at 1-σ, 2-σ, and 3-σ levels,
respectively, for the advanced LIGO. If the true equa-
tion of state is stiﬀ and the corresponding neutron-star

13

radius is R & 13 km, this suggests that R will be con-
strained within ≈ 1 km at the 2-σ level for an event of
Deﬀ = 200 Mpc. On the other hand, if the true equation
of state is soft and R . 12 km, it will be diﬃcult to ac-
curately identify the equations of state among many soft
candidates, although it is still possible to discriminate
it from stiﬀ equations of state with R & 13 km. These
results indicate that measuring the tidal deformability
is a promising method for constraining the neutron-star
equation of state in the near future.

The analysis in this paper was carried out for given
values of mass and mass ratio of the binaries. In real-
ity, these parameters have to be also determined in the
data analysis. The uncertainty in these parameters will
enhance the uncertainty in the estimation for the dimen-
sionless tidal deformability as shown in Ref. [20]. There-
fore, the estimation for the measurability of the dimen-
sionless tidal deformability in this paper would be opti-
mistic. We are now deriving more numerical waveforms
changing the mass and mass ratio. More realistic analy-
sis for the measurability will be carried out in the next
work.

We also examined the validity of the waveforms by
the EOB, TT4 (hybrid-TT4), and TF2 formalisms. Our
analysis shows that these waveforms deviate from our hy-
brid waveforms. Comparison between the hybrid wave-
forms and those by these approximants suggests that the
EOB waveform would be better than others. However,
there is still a room for the improvement of the current
EOB formalism in particular for neutron stars with stiﬀ
equations of state in which Λ > 1000. For the current
version of the TT4 and TF2 approximants, the absence
of higher-order PN terms is the likely source for the in-
accuracy. For the TT4, the absence of the higher-order
PN terms in the tidal eﬀects is the main source for the
inaccuracy. For the TF2, the absence of both higher-PN
terms in the tidal and non-tidal eﬀects is likely to be the
source for the inaccuracy. Improving these approximants
is one of the interesting issues for the future.

is due to the unphysical modulation of the gravitational waveforms (see text).

Appendix A: Gravitational-wave frequency evolution

Appendix B: Comparison of the EOB and TT4 wave

phases

For providing supplementary information of

the
gravitational waveforms plotted in Fig. 1, we show
gravitational-wave frequency as a function of the re-
tarded time for numerical (solid curves) and EOB (dot-
dot curves) waveforms in Fig. 7. As we already de-
scribed in Ref.
[27], two frequency curves agree with
each other except for tret . 5 ms and for the stage just
prior to the merger (around tret ∼ 60 ms). The early-
time spike around tret ≈ 2 ms and associated modula-
tion are caused by the fact that the initial condition,
which describes inspiral binary neutron stars only ap-
proximately because a conformal ﬂatness formulation is
employed (e.g., Ref. [61]), is contaminated by an unphys-
ical component of gravitational waves. Thus, the numer-
ical waveforms only with tret & 5 ms are reliable. The
late-time disagreement is larger for the stiﬀ equation of
state which has high values of Λ & 1000, as expected
from Fig. 1. This also indicates that there is still a room
for incorporating additional tidal eﬀects into the EOB
formalism for improving it. On the other hand, for softer
equations of state with Λ < 1000 like the SFHo equation
of state, the disagreement is minor. This indicates that
the EOB waveforms well capture the tidal-deformation
eﬀects as long as Λ ≪ 1000.

We compare the wave phases derived by an EOB and
TT4 equation of motion. Figure 8 plots the absolute
value of the diﬀerence in the wave phases (wave phase
of the TT4 approximant, ΦTT4, minus that of the EOB
formalism, ΦEOB) as a function of the gravitational-wave
frequency, f , for the APR, SFHo, DD2, TMA, and TM1
equations of state. For taking the diﬀerence, we align
the two phases at f = 50 Hz. For f & 400 Hz, ΦTT4
is always larger than ΦEOB, and the diﬀerence steeply
increases with f . This is due to the fact that the or-
bital (gravitational-wave frequency) evolution in the TT4
approximant is slower than that in the EOB formal-
ism in such a frequency band. On the other hand, for
f . 200 Hz, ΦEOB is by . 0.1 rad larger than ΦTT4.
This would stem from the diﬀerence in more than 4PN
non-tidal terms between the EOB and the TT4 equations
of motion. To clarify this fact, we also plot the curve for
Λ = 0 (see the curve labeled by “BBH”).

To identify the source of the phase diﬀerence in the
high-frequency region f & 400 Hz, we also plot a dot-dot
line of 10(f /1 kHz)3 ∝ x9/2 in Fig. 8. The slope of this
curve approximately captures the behavior of ΦTT4 −
ΦEOB for f . 1 kHz. Note that the phase in the TT4

stituted for dx/dt and F (x) denotes the terms in [· · · ]
of Eq. (3.5): 1 − 487x/168 · · · . Equation (B1) indicates
that the error of ΦTT4, which is associated with the insuf-
ﬁciency for incorporating higher-order PN tidal eﬀects,
should be of order x4 for the 1.5PN tidal eﬀect and x9/2
for the 2PN tidal eﬀect. The slope of Fig. 8 indicates
that the lack of such higher PN tidal eﬀects would be the
dominant source of the disagreement.

Figure 8 shows that the phase diﬀerence at f ≈ 400 Hz
is appreciable; it is ∼ 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 rad for the DD2,
TMA, and TM1 equations of state, respectively. This
diﬀerence results in disagreement of the hybrid-EOB and
hybrid-TT4 waveforms as illustrated in Sec. III. If the
hybridization could be done for a lower-frequency band,
the phase diﬀerence would be smaller than ∼ 0.1 rad and
the two hybrid waveforms would agree with each other
in a better manner. However, Fig. 8 suggests that the
lack of the more than 4PN non-tidal terms in the TT4
approximant would also cause the phase disagreement
of O(0.1) rad even for f . 300 Hz (if the coeﬃcients of
the 4PN terms were of O(100), this would be the case).
This lack could give non-negligible damage for making
a measurement template. Higher-order non-tidal terms
will be also required for improving the TT4 approximant.

Appendix C: Measurability in the Taylor-F2

approximant

By calculating ||h1 − h2|| of Eq. (4.1), we also ana-
lyzed the measurability of the dimensionless tidal de-
formability using a TF2 approximant of the inspiral-
ing compact binaries of mass 1.35M⊙–1.35M⊙. Again,
we employ the one-sided noise spectrum density for the
“Zero Detuning High Power” conﬁguration of advanced
LIGO as Sn(f ) [56]. Here, for the TF2 approximant,
we employ the spinless 3.5PN phasing [54] incorporating
the contribution of the tidal deformability up to 1PN or-
der with respect to the leading-order tidal term [14, 20].
For the Fourier amplitude, we employ the 3PN formu-
lation for the point-particle approximation, described in
Ref. [62], incorporating a tidal correction up to the 1PN
order [14, 32]. Speciﬁcally, the spectrum is derived from
a stationary phase approximation and is assumed to be
written in a polynomial form:

mass. We restrict our attention only to the formulation
in the equal-mass case.

The analysis for the measurability of the tidal de-
formability was performed varying fi and ff . Six results
with diﬀerent values of fi and ff are listed in Table V.
Here, we should pay attention only to the results with
ff smaller than ∼ 2 kHz because by the TF2 approx-
imant, the merger and post-merger waveforms are not
taken into account. Comparing the results of (fi, ff ) =
(10 Hz, 2000 Hz), (30 Hz, 2000 Hz), (50 Hz, 2000 Hz), and
(100 Hz, 2000 Hz), we ﬁnd that employing fi = 30 Hz,
50 Hz, and 100 Hz, the values of ||h1 − h2|| are systemat-
ically underestimated by ∼ 5%, 15%, and 30%, respec-
tively.

Comparing the results of (fi, ff ) = (10 Hz, 500 Hz),
(10 Hz, 1000 Hz), and (10 Hz, 2000 Hz), it is found that
the values of ||h1 − h2|| are underestimated by a factor of
2 for ff = 500 Hz. This is reasonable because the tidal-
deformation eﬀect in phasing is accumulated in the ﬁnal
inspiral orbits most signiﬁcantly. The values of ||h1 − h2||
for (10 Hz, 1000 Hz) are only by ≤ 0.2 smaller than those
for (10 Hz, 2000 Hz) for the case that ||h1 −h2|| ≥ 2.5. On
the other hand, for ||h1 − h2|| . 2, the diﬀerence between
the two cases can be 0.3–0.4. For such case, it would be
necessary to choose ff > 1 kHz.

To further describe the dependence of ||h1 −h2|| on the

choice of fi and ff , we generate Fig. 9. In the left three
panels of Fig. 9, we plot ||h1 − h2|| at Deﬀ = 200 Mpc
as a function of fi for ff = 500–1000 Hz with (Λ1, Λ2) =
(200, 0) (top), (400, 0) (middle), and (1000, 0) (bottom)
(referred to as δΛ = 200, 400, and 1000), respectively.
In the right three panels of Fig. 9, we plot ||h1 − h2|| at
Deﬀ = 200 Mpc as a function of ff for fi = 10–100 Hz
with δΛ = 200 (top), 400 (middle), and 1000 (bottom),
respectively. As the left panels of this ﬁgure indicate,
the values of ||h1 − h2|| for fi = 30 Hz and 50 Hz are
respectively by ≈ 5% and 15% smaller than those for fi =
10 Hz irrespective of δΛ for which we choose a realistic
range. This suggests that for ||h1 − h2|| . 4, the values
of ||h1 − h2|| are underestimated only for a small fraction
within 0.2 and 0.6, respectively, if we choose fi = 30 Hz
and 50 Hz: Such fraction (in particular for fi = 30 Hz)
does not change our conclusion in this paper. As the
right panels indicate, this property is independent of the
choice of ff .

The right three panels of Fig. 9 show that for a large
value of δΛ & 400, ||h1 − h2|| depends only weakly on the
choice of ff as long as it is larger than ≈ 1.5 kHz. For
δΛ = 200, ||h1 − h2|| appears to increase with ff even at
ff = 1.5 kHz. The reason for this is that for a small value
of δΛ, the values of ||h1 − h2|| is accumulated relatively
in a higher frequency range. Thus for such case, it is nec-
