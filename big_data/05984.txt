ABSTRACT

We introduce a series of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of L∗ (M200 =
1011.7 − 1012.3M(cid:12)) and group-sized (M200 = 1012.7 − 1013.3M(cid:12)) haloes run with the
model used for the EAGLE project, which additionally includes a non-equilibrium ion-
ization and cooling module that follows 136 ions. The simulations reproduce the ob-
served correlation, revealed by COS-Halos at z ∼ 0.2, between O vi column density at
impact parameters b < 150 kpc and the speciﬁc star formation rate (sSFR≡SFR/M∗)
of the central galaxy at z ∼ 0.2. We ﬁnd that the column density of circumgalactic
O vi is maximal in the haloes associated with L∗ galaxies, because their virial tem-
peratures are close to the temperature at which the ionization fraction of O vi peaks
(T ∼ 105.5 K). The higher virial temperature of group haloes (> 106 K) promotes
oxygen to higher ionization states, suppressing the O vi column density. The observed
NO vi-sSFR correlation therefore does not imply a causal link, but reﬂects the chang-
ing characteristic ionization state of oxygen as halo mass is increased. In spite of the
mass-dependence of the oxygen ionization state, the most abundant circumgalactic
oxygen ion in both L∗ and group haloes is O vii; O vi accounts for only 0.1% of the
oxygen in group haloes and 0.9-1.3% with L∗ haloes. Nonetheless, the metals traced
by O vi absorbers represent a fossil record of the feedback history of galaxies over a
Hubble time; their characteristic epoch of ejection corresponds to z > 1 and much
of the ejected metal mass resides beyond the virial radius of galaxies. For both L∗
and group galaxies, more of the oxygen produced and released by stars resides in the
circumgalactic medium (within twice the virial radius) than in the stars and ISM of
the galaxy.

1 INTRODUCTION

A self-consistent model of galaxy formation requires an un-
derstanding of the relationship between the galactic compo-
nents, stars and the interstellar medium (ISM), and the sur-
rounding gaseous reservoir that extends to the virial radius

and beyond, deﬁned roughly as the circumgalactic medium
(CGM). At redshift z < 0.5, the galactic component is
well characterised through observational inference of stel-
lar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and morphologies.
The corresponding CGM remains much more challenging
to characterise, because its diﬀuse nature generally requires
absorption line spectroscopy toward background UV-bright
sources. This signiﬁcant reservoir of halo gas clearly plays

2

B. D. Oppenheimer et al.

a central role in the cycling of baryons into and out of a
galaxy, regulating its growth; however the details of the
galaxy-CGM relationship remain elusive.

Until recently, UV absorption line spectroscopy could
not target low-redshift galactic haloes, because only a small
number of quasars were bright enough. The study of the
metal enrichment of the low-z intergalactic medium (IGM)
relied on surveys of metal lines in serendipitous sight lines
providing a cross section-weighted sampling (e.g. Thom &
Chen 2008; Tripp et al. 2008; Wakker & Savage 2009; Tilton
et al. 2012; Danforth et al. 2014). These observations could
be confronted with cosmological hydrodynamical simula-
tions that included metal enrichment from galactic super-
winds to learn how the nucleosynthetic products of star for-
mation enrich the diﬀuse CGM and IGM (e.g. Aguirre et
al. 2001; Schaye et al. 2003; Springel & Hernquist 2003b;
Oppenheimer & Dav´e 2006, 2009; Tornatore et al. 2010;
Wiersma et al. 2010; Cen & Chisari 2011; Smith et al. 2011;
Tepper-Garcia et al. 2011; Tescari et al. 2011; Oppenheimer
et al. 2012; Crain et al. 2013; Rahmati et al. 2015b).

The installation of the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph
(COS) greatly increased the throughput of UV spectroscopy
on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) platform (e.g. Sav-
age et al. 2010), enabling the use of fainter quasar targets
illuminating foreground galactic haloes. Several HST pro-
grams have exploited this new capability to investigate the
gaseous environments of a sample of low-z haloes, including
COS-Halos (Tumlinson et al. 2013), COS-Dwarfs (Bordoloi
et al. 2014), and COS-GASS (Borthakur et al. 2015). Other
recent studies have also characterised the CGM relative to
samples of galaxies, including Chen et al. (2010); Bordoloi et
al. (2011); Kacprzak et al. (2011); Borthakur et al. (2013);
Churchill et al. (2013); Nielsen et al. (2013); Stocke et al.
(2013); Liang & Chen (2014); Kacprzak et al. (2015) at low-
z and Turner et al. (2014) at high-z.

One of the ﬁrst COS-Halos results demonstrated sta-
tistically that the properties of O vi absorption, out to im-
pact parameter b = 150 kpc, correlate with the properties
of the host galaxies (Tumlinson et al 2011, hereafter T11).
The strongest correlation was found between the O vi col-
umn density (NO vi) and the speciﬁc star formation rate
(sSFR≡SFR/M∗) of the galaxy, such that the bimodality in
sSFR between the COS-Halos star-forming sample and the
passive sample is clearly reﬂected in their O vi columns. Of
the 12 COS-Halos passive galaxies, deﬁned as having sSFR
less than 10−11 yr−1, at least half have NO vi < 1014.0cm−2,
while 90% of the 30 COS-Halos star-forming galaxies have
NO vi > 1014.2cm−2 and the median NO vi is 1014.5cm−2
at b < 150 kpc.
T11 identiﬁed O vi haloes as a major reservoir of the
metals synthesized by star-forming galaxies, estimating a
typical O vi mass of ≈ 2×106M(cid:12) when summing the median
O vi column of 1014.5cm−2 over a 150 kpc radius aperture.
The total mass of oxygen traced by COS-Halos is at least
1.2 × 107M(cid:12) when assuming a maximum O vi ionization
fraction, xO vi = 0.2. Peeples et al. (2014) explored the O vi
haloes in the context of the total metal budget estimated
to be synthesized by galaxies, concluding that there exists
nearly as much metal mass traced by circumgalactic O vi as
in the ISM of galaxies with M∗ < 1010M(cid:12) for xO vi = 0.2.
The discovery of such a large reservoir of O vi-traced
metals extending far beyond the stellar disk of the galaxy

leads to several questions about the dynamical link between
galaxies and their associated CGM. Is there a direct rela-
tion between the O vi in haloes and star formation as sug-
gested by the O vi-sSFR correlation? Such a link would im-
ply that typical L∗ galaxies are spewing enriched gas in
galactic winds out to 150 kpc and beyond in the low-z Uni-
verse. A number of large-volume simulations (e.g. Ford et al.
2013, 2015; Suresh et al. 2015a,b) and zooms with cosmo-
logical initial conditions (e.g. Stinson et al. 2012; Hummels
et al. 2013; Shen et al. 2014; Gutcke et al. 2016) have found
an intimate link between galaxies and their metal-enriched
CGM. Simulations that speciﬁcally compared with the COS-
Halos survey ﬁnd lower O vi column densities than observed
around star-forming galaxies (Ford et al. 2015; Suresh et al.
2015b). The Ford et al. (2015) simulations do not include Ac-
tive Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback and do not reproduce
the O vi bimodality, while Suresh et al. (2015b) argue that
AGN feedback clears out the CGM around passive galaxies
thus reducing O vi column densities around passive galaxies.
Another possibility is that CGM O vi is not directly
attributable to recent star formation or AGN activity, and
that instead the O vi bimodality arises from a more funda-
mental relationship. To assess this possibility, we need to
ask what is the physical nature of O vi? If O vi is predom-
inantly photo-ionized gas at ∼ 104 K (e.g. Oppenheimer &
Dav´e 2009), then such absorbers could be a signature of
cold ﬂows (e.g. Kereˇs et al. 2005; Dekel et al. 2009; van
de Voort et al. 2012) feeding star formation, which may
subside around passive galaxies. Enhanced photo-ionization
from young stars could also ionize O vi around star-forming
galaxies (Oppenheimer & Schaye 2013b; Vasiliev et al. 2015;
Suresh et al. 2015b). Alternatively, if O vi is primarily col-
lisionally ionized at its 105.5 K peak (e.g. Heckman et al.
2002; Cen & Chisari 2011; Smith et al. 2011; Tepper-Garcia
et al. 2011; Faerman et al. 2016), then it signals a hot halo
component apparently associated with star-forming galax-
ies. Is this warm-hot component related to recent outﬂows
or does it trace the temperature of a virialized, quasi-static
halo? If the latter, do passive galaxies lack O vi haloes, be-
cause their virial temperatures are much hotter than 105.5
K?

Knowledge of the physical cause of the ionization is
required to constrain xO vi, from which the total mass of
oxygen and metals in the CGM is inferred. Because the
O vi-traced CGM mass scales inversely with xO vi, far more
CGM oxygen would be present if xO vi is much lower than
the maximal value implied by ionization analyses. Hence, it
is uncertain how much underlying CGM oxygen the COS-
Halos O vi observation indicate.

To understand the origin and nature of O vi in a set
of haloes hosting galaxies corresponding to those probed by
COS-Halos, we need cosmological simulations that can si-
multaneously model the stellar build-up of galaxies, the feed-
back processes that eject gas from galaxies, and the detailed
atomic processes that govern the abundances of the ions ob-
served in the CGM. Here, we run a series of zoom simulations
targeting a range of galactic haloes similar to those probed
by the COS-Halos survey using the same model as the EA-
GLE simulations (Schaye et al. 2015, hereafter S15; Crain
et al. 2015). The parameters of the subgrid physics routines
employed by the EAGLE simulations were calibrated to re-
produce the observed z ∼ 0.1 galactic stellar mass function,

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

EAGLE zooms of the circumgalactic medium 3

the super-massive black hole (SMBH) mass-M∗ relation, and
the sizes of galaxy discs using a combination of star forma-
tion (SF)-driven thermal winds and SMBH thermal winds.
Observations of the CGM were not used to calibrate the EA-
GLE simulations, therefore the outcomes here are genuine
predictions of the model.

2 SIMULATIONS

In this Section, we give a brief overview of the EAGLE sim-
ulation code, followed by how our non-equilibrium module
is integrated with it. We then describe our zoom simulations
with attention paid to how the adopted physical model used
here diﬀers from the standard EAGLE implementation.

Here we integrate the non-equilibrium (NEQ) ioniza-
tion and dynamical cooling module introduced by Oppen-
heimer & Schaye (2013a, hereafter OS13) into the EAGLE
simulation code to trace the evolution of 136 ions of 11
elements on the ﬂy, which we activate at late times for
evolved haloes. The module includes photo-ionization from a
meta-galactic background, in this case the Haardt & Madau
(2001) quasar+galaxy background. Note, however, that we
do not include local sources of radiation, which may intro-
duce NEQ eﬀects if they are variable, for example as is ex-
pected for AGN (Oppenheimer & Schaye 2013a). NEQ ion-
ization of oxygen was explored in simulations by Cen & Fang
(2006) and Yoshikawa & Sasaki (2006), both of whom noted
some diﬀerences for O vi, O vii, and O viii in global IGM
statistics relative to equilibrium ionization assumptions. We
do not concentrate on NEQ versus equilibrium results in this
work, except to note that column densities of high oxygen
ions (O vi and above) typically diﬀer by less than 30% (0.1
dex) along individual lines of sight and are at most a few per-
cent diﬀerent when considering ion masses integrated over
an aperture of size 150 kpc. We also note that this work is the
ﬁrst we know of to integrate ion-by-ion cooling rates includ-
ing for the metals into a cosmological simulation; however
these do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the integrated properties of
galaxies (M∗, SFR, colour).

Our investigation focuses on the O vi column density
observations from COS-Halos. We stress that no CGM mock
observations have been calibrated against actual absorption
line observations. Nevertheless, EAGLE shows agreement
with cosmic H i statistics tracing the IGM over a Hubble
time (Rahmati et al. 2015a). Furthermore, because EAGLE
reproduces key stellar and cold ISM properties of galaxies
(e.g. S15; Furlong et al. 2015, 2016; Lagos et al. 2015a,b;
Trayford et al. 2015; Bah´e et al. 2016; Segers et al. 2015),
while explicitly following the hydrodynamics, it is an ideal
testbed for this study and will indicate whether additional
physical processes are necessary to reproduce CGM mea-
surements. This enables us to consider the total metal bud-
get inside and beyond galaxies as done by Bouch´e et al.
(2007); Zahid et al. (2012); Peeples et al. (2014). We also
compare our results to the related work of Rahmati et al.
(2015b), who explored IGM metal-line statistics, including
O vi, in the EAGLE cosmological boxes.

The layout of the paper is as follows. We describe
our zoom simulations and implementation of our non-
equilibrium module in §2. We present the physical nature
and origin of the oxygen-traced CGM in §3, and then con-
front the COS-Halos observations in §4. The global content
of oxygen produced and distributed by galaxies is consid-
ered in §5. We discuss the implications of our results in §6
and summarize in §7. Non-equilibrium eﬀects and resolution
convergence are explored in the Appendix.

2.1 The EAGLE simulation code

The EAGLE simulation code is an extensively modiﬁed
version of the N-body+Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic
(SPH) code Gadget-3 last described by Springel (2005),
which is described in detail by S15. The main modiﬁca-
tions to the entropy-conserving SPH implementation of the
Gadget-3 code (Springel & Hernquist 2003a) comprise i)
the pressure-entropy SPH formulation described by Hopkins
(2013), ii) the artiﬁcial viscosity switch of Cullen & Dehnen
(2010), iii) the artiﬁcial conduction switch of Price (2008),
iv) the timestep limiter from Durier & Dalla Vecchia (2012)
to improve energy conservation during sudden changes of
internal energy, and v) a C2 Wendland (1995) 58-neighbour
kernel to suppress particle-pairing instabilities (Dehnen &
Aly 2012). Collectively, these updates are referred to as “An-
archy” (Dalla Vecchia, in prep.; see also Appendix A of S15)
and the impact of their inclusion on the galaxy population
was explored by Schaller et al. (2015).

A number of subgrid physics modules are included in
the EAGLE code. Equilibrium radiative cooling and photo-
heating rates are computed for 11 elements exposed to
the Haardt & Madau (2001) extra-galactic ionization back-
ground plus the Cosmic Background Radiation as described
by Wiersma et al. (2009a). These rates are computed using
CLOUDY (version 07.02 Ferland et al. 1998), and are replaced
here with the NEQ rates of OS13 described in §2.2 when
run in NEQ mode.
Star formation is modelled using the Schaye & Dalla
Vecchia (2008) pressure-based law. A pressure ﬂoor, PEOS ∝
ρ4/3 is additionally imposed, corresponding to a polytropic
equation of state, normalised to TEOS = 8000 K at nH =
0.1cm−3, because we do not resolve the Jeans scales of the
cold ISM. The Kennicutt (1998) SF surface density relation-
ship is reproduced by construction for gas particles above
the Schaye (2004) metallicity-dependent SF density thresh-
old. The stellar evolution and enrichment module introduced
by Wiersma et al. (2009b) includes element-by-element and
mass metal loss from AGB stars, stellar winds from mas-
sive stars, and SNe (core collapse and Type Ia), which is
distributed across the SPH kernel of each stellar particle. A
Chabrier (2003) initial mass function (IMF) is adopted.

Following Dalla Vecchia & Schaye (2012), feedback as-
sociated with star formation and the SMBH growth is im-
plemented by stochastically heating gas particles neigh-
bouring newly-formed star particles and accreting SMBH.
The energy budgets available associated with stellar feed-
back and black hole growth govern the probability of heat-
ing each SPH particle. Brieﬂy, stellar feedback heats par-
ticles by ∆T = 107.5K in a single episode 30 Myr after
a star particle forms. The fraction of the available energy
injected into the ISM depends on the local gas metallic-
ity (Z) to account for more eﬃcient cooling at higher Z,
and the local gas density to compensate for artiﬁcial radia-

tive losses that occur at high density (see S15; Crain et al.
2015, for further motivation). SMBH growth and AGN feed-
back are implemented using a single thermal mode following
Booth & Schaye (2009) with the addition of the suppression
of high angular momentum gas accretion following Rosas-
Guevara et al. (2013). We use the high-resolution EAGLE-
Recal prescription, which applies a heating temperature of
∆TAGN = 109.0K.

2.2 Non-equilibrium network integrated into

EAGLE

The NEQ module, introduced by OS13, explicitly follows the
reaction network of 136 ionization states of all 11 elements
that contribute signiﬁcantly to the cooling (H, He, C, N, O,
Ne, Si, Mg, S, Ca, & Fe) plus the electron density of the
plasma. These are the same elements as are present in the
equilibrium cooling module of Wiersma et al. (2009a), en-
abling a self-consistent switching between using equilibrium
lookup tables and the NEQ method. Our reaction network,
described fully by OS13, includes radiative and di-electric re-
combination, collisional ionization, photo-ionization, Auger
ionization, and charge transfer. Cooling is performed ion-by-
ion (Gnat & Ferland 2012, OS13) summing over all 136 ions.
OS13 veriﬁed that this method reproduces published results
obtained with other codes. We use particle-based (instead of
kernel-smoothed) ion and metal abundances for NEQ ion-
ization and cooling as explained in §2.3.3.

Our NEQ module applies the Sundials CVODE1 solver to
integrate the ionization and cooling over a hydrodynamic
timestep using the backward diﬀerence formula and Newton
iteration. Although an extended version of the network is
also capable of modelling ISM chemistry including molecu-
lar formation, cooling, and dissociation (see Richings et al.
2014), we focus on the CGM and do not use the NEQ net-
work for gas densities above the metallicity-dependent SF
threshold. For ISM gas, deﬁned as having non-zero SFR, we
use equilibrium lookup tables tabulated as functions of den-
sity assuming T = 104 K, although we note that this mat-
ters little as the ion abundances will rapidly evolve when
the SPH particle is heated by feedback, and the NEQ net-
work followed. Upon enrichment, SPH particles receive the
new metals in their ground-state ions. The vast majority of
enrichment occurs in the ISM gas, where the network is not
used. However, enrichment of gas followed using the NEQ
network occurs when stars outside of galaxies enrich via de-
layed feedback (e.g. Type Ia SNe & AGB winds). Our explo-
ration here focuses on CGM gas traced by oxygen absorp-
tion, most of which is far from galaxies; hence the details of
the ion abundances in ISM gas and from recent enrichment
is essentially inconsequential. We set the CVODE absolute tol-
erance to 10−9 and the relative tolerances to 10−3.

2.3 Zoom simulations

2.3.1 Initial conditions

We assume the same Planck Collaboration (2014) cosmo-
logical parameters adopted by the EAGLE simulations:

1 https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html

Ωm = 0.307, ΩΛ = 0.693, Ωb = 0.04825, H0 = 67.77
km s−1 Mpc−1, σ8 = 0.8288, and ns = 0.9611. To gener-
ate the zoomed initial conditions, we use initial conditions
generated using the second-order Lagrangian perturbation
theory method of Jenkins (2010) and the public Gaussian
white noise ﬁeld Panphasia (Jenkins & Booth 2013). Tar-
gets for resimulation are identiﬁed at z = 0, and the par-
ticles comprising a spherical region that encloses the target
object to a radius of 3R200 (where R200 encloses an over-
density of 200× the critical overdensity) are traced back to
their coordinates in the unperturbed initial particle distri-
bution. A contiguous surface enclosing the particles is iden-
tiﬁed out to 3× the virial radius, and the volume it encloses
is resampled with a high-resolution particle load realised by
tiling a cubic periodic glass distribution (White 1994). This
high-resolution particle load is divided into SPH and high-
resolution dark matter (DM1) particles, using Ωb = 0.04825
and Ωm − Ωb = 0.259 respectively. The remaining volume
within the simulation domain is resampled with an un-
divided load of collisionless particles whose resolution de-
creases as a function of distance from the surface ensuring
the faithful reproduction of large-scale gravitational forces
throughout the high-resolution region. A glass-like particle
distribution guarantees that the initial particle load is es-
sentially free of unwanted power above shot noise frequency.
The high-frequency components of the Gaussian random
ﬁeld perturbations can then faithfully be imposed on the
zoom region. The initial conditions are generated at z = 127.

2.3.2 Selected haloes
We simulate two sets of haloes, a sample of ten L∗ haloes
selected from the EAGLE Recal-L025N0752 simulation, and
a sample of ten “group-sized”, super-L∗ haloes from the
Ref-L100N1504 simulation. The L∗ galaxy haloes are re-
ferred to as Gal001-Gal010 and the group haloes are re-
ferred to as Grp000-Grp009 in Table 1. We run at three
resolutions, which we will refer using the nomenclature
M[log(mSPH/M(cid:12))], where mSPH is the initial mass of SPH
particles.
M5.3 Zooms: We simulate all haloes at our ﬁducial res-
olution, corresponding to an SPH particle mass resolution
of 2.3 × 105M(cid:12), and a dark matter (DM) particle mass of
1.2 × 106M(cid:12). The Plummer-equivalent softening length is
350 proper pc below z = 2.8, and 1.33 comoving kpc above
z = 2.8, which corresponds to 1/25th of the mean interpar-
ticle separation. This is the same resolution as achieved by
the L025N0752 simulation. We can cross-reference the zoom
L∗ M5.3 galaxies with the same galaxies in the L025N0752
galaxies, which we do in Appendix B to ensure that the
zooms do not diﬀer substantially from their parent cosmo-
logical volume. We also cross-reference the group zooms, al-
though note that these zooms have 8× (2×) higher mass
(spatial) resolution than the L100N1504 simulation.
M4.4 Zooms: We simulate the L025N0752 haloes at 8×
higher resolution, corresponding to mSPH = 2.7 × 104M(cid:12)
(mDM = 1.6× 105M(cid:12)), and a softening length of 175 proper
pc below z = 2.8, and 655 comoving pc at earlier times.
All of these are run in equilibrium, and a selection in non-
equilibrium. We only use these zooms to test resolution con-
vergence in the Appendix B and they are listed there in
Table B2.

M6.2 Zooms: We simulate a selection of haloes at the res-
olution of the L100N1504 box, mSPH = 1.8 × 106M(cid:12) and
mDM = 9.7× 106M(cid:12), and also compare directly to the same
galaxies in the 100 Mpc box, which allows us to link our
results to the global IGM results of Rahmati et al. (2015b),
who use this box as their ﬁducial simulation.

Each zoom is focused on one halo, but surrounding sim-
ulated regions often contain additional haloes that are either
partially or fully sampled by SPH and high-resolution DM1
particles. We ﬁnd a set of “bonus” haloes that we veriﬁed
to be completely resolved with SPH and DM1 particles out
to three times the virial radius (R200), and add these to our
sample. Bonus haloes at our main redshift (z = 0.205) in-
clude three sub-L∗ galaxies (M200 (cid:46) 1011.5M(cid:12)) found at a
distance greater than 3×R200 of the targeted L∗ haloes, two
low-mass L∗ haloes (M200 = 1011.6M(cid:12)) and two L∗ haloes
(M200 = 1012.0−12.5M(cid:12)) found beyond 3 × R200 of targeted
group haloes, and three bonus haloes (M200 = 1012.0−12.6)
in the Gal010 zoom, which itself is by far the most massive
“Galaxy” zoom, and tracks the formation of a 1012.7M(cid:12)
z = 0 halo.

2.3.3 Running in equilibrium

We evolve all zooms using the equilibrium cooling rates from
Wiersma et al. (2009a) to z = 0 using the standard EA-
GLE code with the only diﬀerence being that we do not
use kernel-smoothed metallicities to compute cooling rates.
As explained by Wiersma et al. (2009b), smoothed metallici-
ties are consistent with the smoothed particle hydrodynamic
formalism; however, their use when adopting NEQ cooling

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

requires that both particle and smoothed ion abundances
are tracked, which for 136 species is a prohibitive memory
requirement. Furthermore, smoothing complicates the inter-
pretation of NEQ ionization eﬀects when ion species are av-
eraged over the SPH kernel. Therefore, to enable a consistent
comparison of methods, we use particle metallicities in both
equilibrium and NEQ runs.

As a consistency test, we run a set of ﬁve M5.3 zoom
runs with smoothed metallicities, ﬁnding that they have 0.11
dex higher stellar masses than their non-smoothed M5.3
zoom counterparts. It appears that smoothed metallicities
increase the SF eﬃciencies by distributing metals over more
particles, increasing the overall cooling rate of the galaxy,
and leading to more star formation. Wiersma et al. (2009b)
also showed that in the OWLS simulations, smoothed metal-
licities increased the SF eﬃciency. We show in Appendix B
that O vi column densities are unaﬀected by metal smooth-
ing.

2.3.4 Running in non-equilibrium

When examining NEQ simulations, we activate the NEQ
module at relatively low redshift in order to minimize the
computational cost of following 136 ionic species. We will
show that the NEQ eﬀects are generally not important for
gas dynamics in a separate study, as predicted by OS13 and
also demonstrated by Richings & Schaye (2015). Further-
more, NEQ eﬀects on CGM ion diagnostics (i.e. observables)
persist for short times compared to the Hubble timescale,
enabling us to begin modelling them only at late times. We
discuss the NEQ eﬀects in Appendix A, which are typically

6

B. D. Oppenheimer et al.

small, < 0.1 dex for oxygen ions. However, it is important to
use the temporal NEQ module, in order to recover the cor-
rect ion species in all circumstances. The magnitude of non-
equilibrium eﬀects can be signiﬁcant in shocks and rapidly
cooling gas, and this behaviour is only captured with use of
the NEQ module.
The L∗ haloes all switch to NEQ cooling at zNEQ =
0.503 and the group haloes at zNEQ = 0.282. The later NEQ
activation for group haloes was adopted to save computa-
tional cost. The NEQ runs begin from a snapshot output
of the equilibrium run, where we iterate CVODE for a long
timescale (δt = 106/[nH/cm−3] yrs) for all species to guar-
antee ionization equilibrium. The EAGLE code then runs as
normal with the Wiersma et al. (2009a) cooling replaced by
the NEQ module iterating the ionization states and cooling
rates via CVODE across the hydrodynamics timestep.

For one group zoom (Grp007) we perform two runs,
zNEQ = 0.503 and 0.282 in order to establish that its
properties are not signiﬁcantly altered at z = 0.250,
since this is the highest redshift we use to compare
to COS-Halos results. We use up to six outputs (z =
0.250, 0.205, 0.149, 0.099, 0.053, 0.0) when confronting COS-
Halos measurements to give a greater range of galaxy prop-
erties as discussed further in §4. Every halo is run past
z = 0.205, with every M5.3 L∗ halo run to z = 0 and 7
out of 10 M5.3 group haloes run to z = 0.

2.3.5 Basic galaxy properties

We plot stellar mass and SFR properties of central galaxies
in our haloes in Figure 1. We run the SUBFIND algorithm
(Springel et al. 2001; Dolag et al. 2009) on our zoom out-
puts, and quantify halo mass as the mass within a sphere
with mean enclosed density 200× the critical overdensity,
M200, centred on the galaxy’s potential minimum. Galaxy
stellar masses (M∗) and star formation rates (SFRs) are cal-
culated by summing the appropriate quantities within a 30
physical kpc sphere around the centre of the central subhalo,
which almost always hosts the most massive galaxy. The top
left panel of Fig. 1 plots the M∗/(M200 × fbar) abundance
matching relation, where fbar ≡ Ωb/Ωm, for central galaxies
from the six redshifts we examine. While our M5.3 haloes
follow the shape of the relationship recovered by Behroozi
et al. (2013) and Moster et al. (2013) at z = 0.2, they are
∼ 0.2− 0.4 dex lower for M200 (cid:38) 1012M(cid:12). As discussed ear-
lier, our use of particle metallicities reduces stellar masses
by 0.1 dex compared with the smoothed metallicity simula-
tions used to calibrate the feedback eﬃciencies. Moreover,
S15 also ﬁnd stellar masses 0.2-0.3 dex lower than the abun-
dance matching constraints (Behroozi et al. 2013; Moster et
al. 2013) at M200 = 1012.0M(cid:12) at z = 0.1 (Recal-L025N0752
shown as a thick yellow line with shading for 1-σ dispersion).
For each central galaxy at a given redshift, we test
whether it would be classiﬁed as isolated using criteria sim-
ilar to those applied by Tumlinson et al. (2013), who se-
lect COS-Halos galaxies as being the most luminous galaxy
within b < 300 kpc of the QSO sightline at its redshift. They
also note that there are usually no L∗ photo-z candidates
within 1 Mpc. We use the criterion that there should not
be any galaxies with M∗ > 2 × 1010M(cid:12) within an impact
parameter b = 300 kpc, ﬁrstly to ensure that our galaxy is
the most massive system inside this impact parameter, and

secondly because we usually do not simulate surrounding
galaxies beyond 3R200. Often there are surrounding haloes
that are not resolved completely by the high-resolution par-
ticle load; however we still use their stellar masses in our
isolation criteria to be conservative, although there are only
a few cases for which this happens. Dark circles in Fig. 1 in-
dicate haloes that appear isolated in at least one of the three
projections we use to cast our sight lines and can be used
for comparison with the COS-Halos dataset (see §4). Trans-
parent squares are for non-isolated haloes in all three pro-
jections, as well as for bonus haloes with M200 < 1011.7M(cid:12),
where we only plot their outputs at z = 0.205. We include
these low-mass haloes for our discussion of halo mass trends
in §3.1, but not for comparisons to the COS-Halos dataset
in §4.

We plot the galaxies on the M∗-sSFR plot in the top
right panel of Fig. 1 to show that our galaxies follow the
general trend of the star-forming sequence observed at low-
z by Gilbank et al. (2010), Bauer et al. (2013), and Chang
et al. (2015), and a set of massive galaxies in group haloes
with low sSFR. Our galaxies do not have a passive clump
at sSFR< 10−11 yr−1 that is as prominent as for the COS-
Halos survey, but the EAGLE boxes do reproduce the pas-
sive fraction as a function of M∗ (S15). Additionally, when
we mock COS-Halos surveys in §4, the galaxies we select to
match the COS-Halos galaxies better reproduce this passive
clump. The bottom row of Fig. 1 shows 50 kpc, SDSS u, g,
and r-band composite maps of two star-forming L∗ galax-
ies (left), and two group centrals, including an active merger
and a passive galaxy (right). These maps are generated using
the SKIRT radiative transfer code (Baes et al. 2011; Camps
& Baes 2015) as described in detail by Trayford et al. (in
prep.).

3 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE

OXYGEN-ENRICHED CIRCUMGALACTIC
MEDIUM

This section begins by exploring CGM properties across
two decades in halo mass, from sub-L∗ haloes (M200 (cid:46)
1011.7M(cid:12)) through L∗ haloes (M200 ∼ 1012M(cid:12)) to group-
sized, super-L∗ haloes (M200 (cid:38) 1012.3M(cid:12)). We further ex-
plore the physical trends that establish the ionization struc-
ture of the oxygen enriched CGM. Lastly, we focus on the
nature and origin of the O vi that is observed by the COS-
Halos survey.

3.1 Trends with halo mass

We begin our discussion by showing three haloes at M5.3
resolution with masses M200 = 1011.1, 1012.2, and 1013.2M(cid:12)
in Figure 2 at the median redshift of the COS-Halos, z = 0.2.
All images are 600 physical kpc across. The central galaxies
have M∗ = 109.0, 1010.4, and 1011.0M(cid:12), and typical SFRs
for their masses.
We show hydrogen column densities in the top row with
halo mass increasing from left-to-right. We plot the ρ − T
diagnostic diagrams of all gas inside of R200 in Figure 3
(top row), and see that the temperature histograms peak at
Tpeak = 104.1, 105.8, and 106.6 K. If we compare the tem-

stellar mass (top right) from 6 redshifts (z = 0.25 → 0) that we use in our analysis. Galaxies that can be considered “isolated” by COS-
Halos criteria are indicated by dark circles, while transparent squares indicate galaxies with a neighboring galaxy with M∗ > 1010.3M(cid:12)
within 300 kpc. Three sub-L∗ galaxies at z = 0.205 are also plotted as light circles. The thick yellow line is the ﬁt to all centrals in

galaxies as a function of M∗ from Gilbank et al. (2010, grey squares), Bauer et al. (2013, brown circles), and Chang et al. (2015, orange
diamonds) are displayed on the right. Bottom panels show simulated 50 kpc SDSS u, g, and r-band composite images, including dust,

Tvir = 105.69K

using the virial theorem, we recover Tvir = 105.1, 105.8,
and 106.5 K (indicated by dashed grey horizontal lines). For
the sub-L∗ halo, the Tpeak (cid:28) Tvir owes to eﬃcient cooling
through the peak of the cooling curve to thermal equilib-
rium at ∼ 104 K, although there does exist a tertiary peak
near Tvir. The more massive haloes have peak temperatures
more similar to Tvir. The virial radius across these haloes in-
creases by nearly a factor of ﬁve from 101 to 486 kpc, mean-
ing that the adoption of a constant radius for the CGM,
often assumed to be 300 kpc (e.g. Rudie et al. 2012; Ford
et al. 2013), samples only the inner region of a group halo,
but includes the diﬀuse IGM for a sub-L∗ halo. It is impor-
tant to remember that the ratio of the impact parameter to
the virial radius varies signiﬁcantly across a survey such as
COS-Halos (Shull 2014).

The second row of Fig. 2 shows that oxygen columns in-
crease with halo mass, and our overall sample indicates that

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

there is an increase of NO with M∗ at all impact param-
eters, except at b < 30 kpc where L∗ galaxies have higher
oxygen columns than groups. The mass of gaseous oxygen
within a 300 kpc sphere increases by a factor of 40 as M200
increases by a factor of 100, with the greatest increase oc-
curring from sub-L∗ to L∗ (17×), while L∗ galaxies have
the highest metallicities within 300 kpc (Z/Z(cid:12) = 0.11, 0.36,
0.22; excluding star-forming gas does little to change these
values).

The third row of Fig. 2 shows the column densities of
O vi. It is striking that the L∗ galaxies have by far the great-
est O vi column density even though they do not have the
highest gas and oxygen masses. The mass of O vi within a
300 kpc sphere increases by a factor of 9 from sub-L∗ to L∗,
but declines by a factor of 90 from the L∗ to the group halo.
The bottom row divides the O vi map by the oxygen
map to show the “ionization fraction,” which severely de-
clines for the group halo. The global O vi fraction within a
300 kpc sphere falls from xO vi = 2.8% to 1.4% from sub-
L∗ to L∗, and to 0.01% for the group halo. O vi is merely
the tip of the iceberg of the oxygen content in the CGM
of star-forming galaxies. Meanwhile, the oxygen in group-
sized haloes essentially disappears in the “O vi ﬁlter”. The

Figure 3. The mass distribution in the density-temperature phase space of the haloes shown in Fig. 2 at z = 0.205. The top row shows
all gas within R200 (listed in the top left in kpc) and the bottom row shows only O vi. Histograms in each panel represent the fraction of
mass as a function of density (bottom) and temperature (left). The dashed grey horizontal line indicates Tvir (Equ. 1), and the dashed
grey vertical line indicates 200× the critical overdensity.

higher O vi fractions on the top left of the group halo (bot-
tom right panel) owes to a lower mass, foreground halo with
higher CGM O vi.

The ρ − T diagrams of gas inside R200 in Fig. 3 clearly
highlight the cause of this eﬀect: groups exhibit virtually no
gas below 2 × 106 K (bottom right panel). The triple-peak
temperature histogram of the O vi distribution in the group
(y-axis histogram) is common among our group haloes: met-
als at T > 106 K and T < 105 K are abundant but have
xO vi < 1%, while a small number of particles are rapidly
cooling through the coronal regime (105− 106 K) and brieﬂy
achieve xO vi ∼ 20%. In contrast, L∗ halo virial tempera-
tures, Tvir ∼ 0.5 − 1 × 106 K, overlap with the collisionally
ionized O vi band at 3 × 105 K (bottom centre panel). The
sub-L∗ CGM has gas between 104− (cid:38) 105 K, and has a
greater proportion of photo-ionized O vi arising from IGM
densities (bottom left panel).

L∗ haloes have higher NO vi (Fig. 2). To demonstrate
that this is a broad trend across all of our haloes, we plot 150
kpc “aperture” columns for oxygen (left) and O vi (right) in
Figure 4 for all galaxies, where we calculate the aperture
column within a cylinder of radius b = 150 kpc by sum-
ming up pixel column densities, N (x, y), as plotted in Fig.
2 according to

where dx is the pixel size such that dx (cid:28) b. We take
aperture columns for each halo in three projections (along
the x, y, & z axis), and show isolated haloes as solid cir-
cles and non-isolated counterparts as transparent squares.

(cid:104)NO(cid:105)150 increases monotonically across our halo mass range,
while (cid:104)NO vi(cid:105)150 peaks for L∗ galaxies and then declines
sharply for M200 > 1012.3M(cid:12). The average (cid:104)NO vi(cid:105)150 for
the L∗ range (M200 = 1011.7 − 1012.3M(cid:12)) is 1014.23cm−2
corresponding to an integrated O vi mass of 1.5 × 106M(cid:12)
within a cylinder of radius 150 kpc. The corresponding val-
ues for groups (M200 = 1012.3 − 1013.3M(cid:12)) are 1013.50cm−2
and 2.8 × 105M(cid:12), or ﬁve times lower. We use only iso-
lated galaxies in these calculations, but by including non-
isolated projections, the (cid:104)NO vi(cid:105)150 in group-sized haloes
rises to 1013.69cm−2, while that of L∗ haloes does not change.
(cid:104)NO(cid:105)150 equals 1015.99cm−2 for L∗ haloes and 1016.51cm−2

for group haloes using isolated samples.

3.2 Circumgalactic radial proﬁles

To better understand the halo trends of the CGM distribu-
tions with mass, we show in Figure 5 physical gas proper-

ties as a function of fractional virial radius at z = 0.205.
The top left panel shows nH including all gas (CGM+ISM)
as a function of r/R200. We use thick lines to indicate
the mean proﬁles for sub-L∗ (M200 < 1011.7M(cid:12), blue), L∗
(1011.7 (cid:54) M200 < 1012.3M(cid:12), aquamarine), and group-sized
(M200 (cid:62) 1012.3, orange) haloes. Sub-L∗ galaxies achieve the
highest inner densities and the lowest outer densities, while
for groups the inner radial proﬁles ((cid:46) 1/3R200) are nearly
ﬂat. ISM gas, deﬁned as gas having SFR> 0, is not included
in these plots, so there is more dense CGM gas around the
lower mass galaxies that have higher sSFR. However, the
density of extended “coronal” gas (1/3R200 (cid:46) r (cid:46) R200)
is higher for group haloes, owing to ineﬃcient cooling at
> 106 K enabling them to retain higher pressure gas. All
haloes are centred on the minimum of the gravitational po-
tential, although one 1012.9M(cid:12) halo is undergoing a major
merger, causing the density to dive inside 1/3R200 and nei-
ther galaxy coincides precisely with the potential minimum.

The gas metallicities in the top right panel are highest
for L∗ haloes in the centre, lower for sub-L∗ throughout the
entire halo, and lower for group haloes in the inner regions.
The curves for individual haloes are noisier in this plot com-
pared to the density plot, because satellite galaxies inﬂuence
radial metallicities more than radial densities; groups have
the greatest number of satellites and thus more peaks over-
all. The bottom left panel showing the radial O vi fraction
(xO vi) shows as strong of a trend of any of the panels in
Fig. 5. The peak in xO vi moves to larger fractional radius
and declines with increasing halo mass. The sub-L∗ galax-
ies achieve xO vi as high as 10% at ∼ R200, because the
lower pressures allow oxygen at photo-ionized O vi temper-
atures, and therefore greater O vi fractions (Oppenheimer
& Dav´e 2009). The L∗ haloes have little scatter in xO vi,
only reach xO vi ∼ 3% at R200, and peak just beyond R200.
This is almost all collisionally ionized O vi, and the maxi-
mal radial xO vi is ∼ 5%, with only a fraction of oxygen
residing around 105.5 K. At M200 > 1012.3M(cid:12), xO vi es-
sentially nosedives, owing to increasing pressures and fast

cooling rates disallowing much oxygen in the O vi collisional
ionization regime.

The product of the ﬁrst three panels, nO vi, is plotted in
the bottom right panel of Fig. 5. The highest O vi densities
are associated with L∗ galaxies, with nO vi peaking just
inside R200. The O vi mass as a function of radius peaks
outside R200, since there is a 4πr2 weighting, as we discuss
next.

3.3 Nature and origin of circumgalactic oxygen

Thus far we have focused on the trends of oxygen and O vi
with halo mass, and we now shift our focus to the distribu-
tion and origin of oxygen-enriched gas in the circumgalactic
medium. We plot the oxygen content as a function of radius
for our standard L∗ haloes in the top left panel of Figure 6.
Green shading on the bottom shows the O vi fraction of the
oxygen budget peaking between one and two R200, which are
represented by vertical dotted lines. It is notable that there
are ﬁve oxygen ions with greater contributions than O vi,
and that O vi is one of the most spatially extended ions.
This is the general result for L∗ haloes, O vi resides primar-
ily beyond R200 or at ∼ 200 − 500 kpc. This suggests that
a signiﬁcant fraction of the O vi detected by COS-Halos at
b < 150 kpc likely arises at physical radii larger than R200.
In the bottom left panel of Figure 6, we show the “age”
of the CGM, by plotting the last time a CGM particle
was in the ISM of a galaxy, which is deﬁned as the last
time the gas particle was star-forming (either in the central
galaxy or a satellite). The vast majority of metals in the
CGM were previously in the ISM and launched by super-
wind feedback into the CGM as found in other SPH simula-
tions (Crain et al. 2013; Ford et al. 2014). The grey shading
shows the oxygen-weighted age distribution as a function of
radii, showing an age-radius anti-correlation, where larger
radii and lower overdensities are enriched by higher redshift
progenitors when halo potentials are lower and comoving
distances are physically smaller (Dav´e & Oppenheimer 2007;

Figure 5. Radial proﬁles averaged in spherical shells of the hydrogen density (nH), oxygen abundance (nO/nH), O vi ion fraction
(xO vi ≡ nO vi/nO), and O vi density (nO vi) as a function of fractional virial radius from top left to bottom right at z = 0.205.
Individual haloes are shown as thin lines, and thick solid lines represent averages of sub-L∗, L∗, and group-sized haloes (blue, aquamarine,
& orange). The dashed line in the top right panel indicates the solar oxygen abundance (nO/nH = 10−3.31). Lower mass haloes have
higher densities in their centres (top left), and L∗ mass haloes have the highest oxygen abundances in their centres (top right). xO vi
(bottom left) shows a strong trend with halo mass. Sub-L∗ haloes (< 1011.5M(cid:12)) have the highest xO vi owing to higher photo-ionized
fractions, but this photo-ionized phase is greatly reduced in L∗ haloes owing to higher pressures. Instead, L∗ haloes are dominated by
collisionally ionized O vi, and ion fractions only reach ∼ 5% at radii just beyond R200. Group haloes have even lower xO vi because the
vast majority of the gas is too hot for O vi, and only gas beyond R200 approaches xO vi of several percent. The bottom right panel,
showing O vi densities, is the product of the previous three panels, and shows the higher O vi densities for sub-L∗ and L∗ haloes than
for group haloes.

2013; Ford et al. 2014). O vi has a mean enrichment red-
shift of z ∼ 1.2 at 300 kpc. Our simulations suggest that
the average age of O vi is ∼ 6 Gyr, and it is thus not asso-
ciated with the on-going SF traced by observational indica-
tors, which probe galactic star formation on a much more
recent timescale, i.e. (cid:46) 100 Myr.

In the right panels of Fig. 6, we plot the relative oxy-
gen content and age distribution around our largest group.
The O vi is hardly visible on this linear plot, peaking at
nearly 2R200. This group halo is dominated by ions that are
only observable in the X-ray, with O ix dominating within
R200. By plotting the oxygen distributions on a physical
rather than fractional virial scale, we emphasize the stark
contrast between the linear distributions of oxygen between
L∗ and group haloes within 1 Mpc. The progenitors of this

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

central passive galaxy have injected most of their metals at
z ∼ 2 where they now reside at larger radii relative to the
L∗ haloes, both in terms of physical distance and fractional
virial distance.

4 COMPARISON TO COS-HALOS DATA

We confront the COS-Halos observational survey using our
new python module called Simulation Mocker Of Hubble
Absorption-Line Observational Surveys (SMOHALOS). We
use SMOHALOS to create mock COS-Halos surveys using
observed impact parameters for galaxies with similar proper-
ties as observed by COS-Halos, which in this case are deﬁned
by M∗ and sSFR. This enables us to take the latest dataset

Figure 6. CGM oxygen as a function of radius is plotted in the top panels for the Gal005 L∗ halo (left, M200 = 1012.2M(cid:12)) and the
Grp008 group-sized halo (right, M200 = 1013.2M(cid:12)). The top solid line indicates the total oxygen content as a function of radius. The
total CGM oxygen content between 101.05 − 102.95 kpc is 3.7× 108 and 2.9× 109M(cid:12) for the L∗ and group haloes respectively. The dotted
vertical lines indicate R200 and 2R200. The bottom panels indicate the age distribution of oxygen in gray shading, where we deﬁne age
as the last redshift an SPH particle was in the ISM. The mean ages of oxygen species (coloured lines) and total oxygen (black line) are
also shown. The gray horizontal dotted line is the redshift of the snapshot. We also repeat the O vi shading from the top panels in the
age panels. O vi in L∗ haloes primarily resides outside R200 and is greater than 5 Gyr old (z > 1). Group-sized haloes enrich a more
extended region at earlier times (z ∼ 2).

from COS-Halos with updated spectroscopic galaxy obser-
vations (e.g. Werk et al. 2012), and make a mock survey
with matched properties.

We do not constrain our mock galaxies to have the same
redshifts as COS-Halos (z = 0.15 − 0.35). Instead, we select
the simulated galaxy with the most similar M∗ and sSFR
that are closest to the observed values from as many as
6 output redshifts (z = 0.250, 0.205, 0.149, 0.099, 0.053, 0.0)
for which we have run our NEQ zooms for a suﬃcient time
(t > 300 Myr). Our galaxies evolve little over this redshift,
except for the cases where there are mergers. We ﬁnd that
the O vi does not evolve signiﬁcantly over this redshift range
either, which we discuss later. The main rationale for this
choice is to obtain more passive galaxies that satisfy the
isolation criteria, because neighbours are either beyond 300
kpc at earlier snapshots, or, more often, merge into a sin-
gle galaxy to satisfy the isolation criteria at later snapshots.
Figure 1 shows galaxies that are isolated in one of three pro-
jections as solid circles. We have in total 123 L∗ and group
galaxies across six redshifts and 20 zoom simulations, 87 of
which are isolated in all 3 projections, and 108 of which are

isolated in at least one projection. One group halo is not
isolated in any projection (Grp005).

We use the T11 list of COS-Halos galaxies, omitting
the two least massive galaxies along each of the J0042-1037,
J0820+2334, and J0943+0531 sight lines (M∗ < 109.5M(cid:12)),
since we do not explicitly simulate such masses, which leaves
39 galaxies in the COS-Halos sample. Stellar masses assume
a Chabrier (2003) IMF, which decreases the stellar masses
reported by Werk et al. (2012) by 0.2 dex, who assumed a
Salpeter (1955) IMF.

We take one-sigma errors on M∗ and sSFR, where we
assume δM∗ = 0.2 dex and use the Balmer-derived SFR and
error from Werk et al. (2012) to calculate the total error
on the sSFR, which are added in quadrature to the error
on M∗ resulting in δsSFR= 0.30 − 0.37 dex. SMOHALOS
applies a Gaussian dispersion seeded by a random number
to the values of the simulated galaxies for the given impact
parameter. We choose the simulated galaxy closest on the
M∗-sSFR plane to the observed galaxy given the errors. We
run 100 such realizations of SMOHALOS to construct 100
simulated COS-Halos galaxy samples using diﬀerent random
number seeds.

Figure 7. Comparisons of the COS-Halos dataset (squares are detections, triangles pointing down are upper limits) to a mock COS-Halos
survey (circles). We choose the simulated galaxy that is closest to the given COS-Halos galaxy in terms of M∗ and sSFR, and choose
the same impact parameter, b, as the observed galaxy in a projection for which the galaxy would be deﬁned as isolated from other L∗
galaxies. The top left panel shows real and mock observations on the M∗-sSFR plane, coloured by O vi column (diamonds here indicate
galaxies with O vi upper limits). The top right panel plots NO vi as a function of sSFR, coloured by M∗. The bottom left panel shows
NO vi as a function of b, coloured by sSFR. The bottom right panel shows only the mock dataset coloured by sSFR to demonstrate
how O vi columns change as a function of halo mass in a mock COS-Halos survey. Dashed lines in the top panels indicate the division
between active and passive galaxies using a sSFR cutoﬀ of 10−11yr−1.

Figure 7, top left, shows a typical SMOHALOS mock
sample, plotted as circles, on the M∗-sSFR plane, with the
COS-Halos galaxies plotted as squares for galaxies with O vi
detections and diamonds for galaxies with O vi upper limits.
Error bars indicate uncertainties on observations. The galax-
ies are colour-coded by their O vi columns in both cases. It
is immediately apparent that while our galaxies generally
reproduce the star-forming and passive distributions seen
by COS-Halos, we do not always obtain the same range
of properties. For example, we do not create galaxies with
M∗ > 1011.0M(cid:12), whereas three of these exist in COS-Halos.

The top right panel shows O vi column density as a
function of sSFR, coloured by M∗, and the bottom left
panel shows O vi columns as a function of impact parameter,
coloured by sSFR (COS-Halos detections are squares and
triangles pointing down are upper limits). The COS-Halos
trend of O vi columns increasing with sSFR is reproduced.
However, our mock O vi columns are too low compared to

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

those inferred from COS-Halos, both as a function of sSFR
and impact parameter.

We plot the SMOHALOS O vi columns against halo
mass in the bottom right panel of Fig. 7 to show that O vi
correlates strongly with M200, even more so than with the
central galaxy sSFR (top right panel). This plot nearly mir-
rors the trend of the 150 kpc aperture columns in Fig. 4,
in part because there is not much dependence of NO vi on
impact parameter. However, there is greater scatter when
choosing pencil beams corresponding to individual sight
lines rather than taking an averaged aperture column. The
colour-coding of symbols in both plots indicates that the
scatter in group sSFR primarily contributes to the reduced

correlation in the NO vi−sSFR relation relative to that in
the NO vi − M200 relation. We suggest that the trend of
NO vi with sSFR found by COS-Halos is driven by halo
mass rather than star formation activity.

We plot the probability distributions of the 100 SMO-

14

B. D. Oppenheimer et al.

HALOS runs in the top two panels of Figure 8 as grey shad-
ing and superimpose the results of the COS-Halos survey,
again as coloured squares and upper limit triangles. The
top panel shows that we consistently identify a bimodal set
of galaxies in the M∗-sSFR plane. The middle panel shows
that the SMOHALOS mock catalogues consistently repro-
duce the O vi-sSFR correlation, although the column densi-
ties are lower than for COS-Halos.
Sub-dividing galaxies into star-forming and passive
samples using an sSFR cut of 10−11 yr−1, SMOHALOS
recovers a median log[NO vi/cm−2]= 14.15 for the “blue”
sample (27 galaxies) and 13.30 for the passive “red” sample
(12 galaxies). The corresponding COS-Halos numbers are
14.57 and < 14.14, respectively, the latter being an upper
limit, owing to most passive COS-Halos columns being non-
detections. The typical column density of our blue sample is
thus a factor of 2.6× too low, and even if we take the SMO-
HALOS sample with the strongest median O vi column of
the 100 realizations, log[NO vi/cm−2]= 14.26, the column
density is 2.0× too low.

In the bottom panel of Fig. 8, we plot the average
SMOHALOS radial O vi column density proﬁles of the star-
forming (cyan) and passive (red) galaxies with shading
indicating 1 and 2-σ dispersions using the 100 SMOHA-
LOS realizations. We rarely reproduce columns in excess
of 1014.5cm−2 and never over 1015.0cm−2 of which there are
two detections in COS-Halos. Also apparent is the surpris-
ingly ﬂat dependence of O vi column on impact parameter
for both star-forming and passive samples. When we sub-
divide the blue sample into two impact parameter bins, we
ﬁnd a larger diﬀerence in the interior CGM, such that me-
dian log[NO vi/cm−2] for COS-Halos and SMOHALOS are
14.70 and 14.16 at 0-75 kpc, and 14.38 and 14.14 at 75-
150 kpc, respectively. Our median mass calculation of O vi
within 150 kpc is 1.3×106M(cid:12), which is about 2× lower than
2.4 × 106M(cid:12) calculated by T11. We discuss this shortfall of
O vi around star-forming galaxies in EAGLE in §6.1.

The interpretation of the comparison to the passive
sample of 12 galaxies is more ambiguous owing to the COS-
Halos non-detections. The median O vi column density may
be consistent between COS-Halos and the SMOHALOS cat-
alogues; however, we never produce O vi columns around
passive galaxies in the range of 1014.2−14.4cm−2, as high
as the three strongest COS-Halos passive detections. We
suspect that our SMOHALOS sample may be cleaner of
neighbours than COS-Halos sample, because observations
can miss surrounding galaxies owing to surface brightness
limits. This was for example the case for the J2257+1340
sight line where two smaller star-forming galaxies were sub-
sequently observed closer to a 1010.9M(cid:12) passive galaxy at
114 kpc (Tumlinson et al. 2013). Group galaxies with neigh-
bours have higher aperture column densities, (cid:104)NO vi(cid:105)150 =
1013.76cm−2, than for isolated ones, 1013.50cm−2.

5 THE OXYGEN CONTENT OF GALACTIC

HALOES

We now consider the total amount of oxygen formed in
galaxies, and the phases this metal occupies at z = 0.2.
Following Peeples et al. (2014, hereafter P14), we normalize
the total mass of oxygen nucleosynthesized and ejected by

scale on the M∗-sSFR plane (top panel) and the NO vi-sSFR
plane (centre panel). COS-Halos data is plotted as in Fig. 7, but
without error bars. The bottom panel shows median NO iv as
a function of impact parameter for the star-forming (cyan) and
passive (red) SMOHALOS samples, including darker and lighter
shading for 1 and 2-σ dispersions. There is hardly any overlap of
the 1-σ dispersions between the star-forming and passive samples.

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

stars to unity for each of our galaxies, and plot the frac-
tion of oxygen found in stars (red), the ISM (blue), and the
CGM (green) in Figure 9. Where P14 plotted a continuous
distribution as a function of stellar mass based on observed
metal abundances scaled to expected nucleosynthetic yields,
we plot bars for our individual galactic haloes and order
them by increasing M200, listed in white at the bottom of
each bar. Our mass distribution is not continuous, and the
group-sized haloes are selected to have a large scatter in the
baryon fractions within R200.

We measure that EAGLE oxygen yields are on aver-
age 2.7% of M∗ at z = 0.2. Even though EAGLE employs
metallicity-dependent yields, this makes negligible diﬀerence
for the summed oxygen yield. This value is nearly the same
as found by P14 who adopted an oxygen yield of 1.5% for the
zero-age main sequence and calculated an average multiple
of 1.8 to account for the fact that ≈ 55% of the stellar mass
survives to z = 0, based on Leitner (2012) star-formation
histories (i.e. 1.5% × 1.8 = 2.7%). It is not surprising that
these two calculations agree, because we are using similar
yields tabulated by Wiersma et al. (2009b) as P14, and be-
cause we are self-consistently following the star-formation
histories accounting for stellar evolution2

One diﬀerence with respect to P14 is that we plot the
total oxygen generated by all galaxies residing in the galac-
tic halo, instead of just the central galaxy. This makes a
marginal diﬀerence for L∗ and sub-L∗ galaxies, but the dif-
ference is quite noticeable for group-sized haloes since the
stellar mass becomes less dominated by the group central;
less than half the stellar mass resides in the central for haloes
of M200 (cid:38) 1013.0M(cid:12). The ISM oxygen content in the 4
largest haloes is contributed almost entirely by satellites.
The stellar oxygen content (red bars) follows the P14
trend with L∗ and group haloes having similar oxygen frac-
tions in stars (their Figure 12), but our sub-L∗ galaxies
(M∗ ∼ 109M(cid:12)) have marginally higher stellar oxygen con-
tent, which is consistent with the EAGLE-Recal simulation
(S15) exhibiting slightly higher stellar metallicities content
than inferred observationally by Gallazzi et al. (2005). The
ISM oxygen content increases at lower mass, owing to higher
gas fractions; the stellar mass-ISM metallicity relationship
(i.e. the MZR) in the EAGLE-Recal prescription reproduces
the observed decline with mass (Tremonti et al. 2004; Za-
hid et al. 2014). Thus far, the agreement is good between
our zooms and the observations, because the EAGLE-Recal
prescription broadly reproduces the observed metal content
of galaxies.

We now report the oxygen contents of the CGM within
R200 and additionally between 1 and 2R200, which are not
nearly as well-constrained by observations (P14). Our main
results are two-fold: 1) there exists more oxygen in the CGM
within 2R200 than in the stellar and ISM content of the
galaxy, and 2) a signiﬁcant fraction, sometimes more than
half of the oxygen, is ejected beyond R200 for L∗ galaxies.
The ﬁrst result, that more oxygen exists outside galaxies
was also inferred by P14. Here, we are omniscient about
the location of our simulated metals, and ﬁnd that there
is almost always more circumgalactic oxygen within 2R200

2 Oxygen that was ﬁrst released and then trapped in the rem-
nants of another generation is included.

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

EAGLE zooms of the circumgalactic medium 15

than in the galaxy (stars+ISM). We plot this CGM oxygen
within 2R200 in Figure 10 categorised by ion. The eight ions
plotted (O i through O viii) plus O ix (not plotted due to
its unobservable nature) sum to unity. Ions lower than O vi
dominate the CGM associated with sub-L∗ and many L∗
galaxies, while ions above O vi always dominate the CGM
of group haloes, often at the 80-95% level indicating the
need for a wide-area space-borne telescope sensitive to soft
X-rays to account for the diﬀuse oxygen around groups.

Even for L∗ haloes, for which O vi is the strongest,
O vi contributes only a small fraction of the oxygen con-
tent of the CGM, which reﬂects this ion’s maximal ≈ 5%
radial ion fraction (§3.1). We plot the CGM within 2R200,
because O vi barely shows up on a plot with the limit of
< R200. The most common ion is O vii, which makes up
23 − 50% of the circumgalactic oxygen at < 2R200 between
M200 = 1011.8 − 1013.0M(cid:12). It is almost as if nature con-
spires to hide diﬀuse oxygen (and most oxygen generated by
stars) from our telescopes, since O vi is the most “easily”
observable CGM ion. Nonetheless, O vi represents a power-
ful probe that we argue arises so strongly around L∗ galaxies
owing to its temperature tracing the virial temperature of
L∗ haloes.

In the bottom panel of Fig. 10 we plot the oxygen frac-
tions assuming collisional ionization equilibrium at the virial
temperature Tvir according to Equ. 1. Our simulated haloes
are of course not isothermal out to 2R200, and show a far
greater diversity of oxygen ionization states, which in part
owes to the neglect of photo-ionization in this simplistic as-
sumption, but most importantly owes to the complex tem-
perature and density structure of the CGM. Nonetheless,
our simulated O vi fractions decline at a similar halo mass,
∼ 1012.3M(cid:12), as this simple model predicts, which clearly
supports our conclusion that O vi traces the virial temper-
atures of L∗ haloes, and not those of group-sized haloes.
Going to sub-L∗ haloes, (cid:46) 1011.7M(cid:12), the simulated haloes
do not show a decline in O vi as predicted by the isother-
mal model, because photo-ionization begins to dominate at
these masses.

Hence, our second main result from Figure 9 is that
up to half of the oxygen generated by an L∗ galaxy re-
sides outside of R200 in the low-z Universe. The implica-
tions for galaxy formation models are profound. Not only
is the closed-box model of galaxy growth inaccurate due to
continuous accretion onto galaxies, the idea that galaxies re-
turn products of star formation to extended CGM reservoirs
from which they can later re-accrete (e.g. Bower et al. 2006;
Oppenheimer et al. 2010; Guo et al. 2011; Henriques et al.
2015) may also be incorrect. The median oxygen content
inside R200 for group-sized haloes (M200 = 1012.7−13.3M(cid:12))
is 69%, which is somewhat higher than that of L∗ haloes
(M200 = 1011.7−12.3M(cid:12)) at 62%. One may expect a larger
diﬀerence across a decade in halo mass, where larger haloes
hold onto a greater proportion of their metals, owing to
their deeper potential wells and physically larger virial radii.
However, group-sized haloes have more star formation at
early times when the Universe is physically smaller and
halo potentials are shallower, which allow winds to travel
to greater comoving distances. Another eﬀect is that group-
sized haloes contain multiple large galaxies with large satel-
lites more likely to lose their metals from a group halo, be-

Figure 9. The oxygen budget for zoom haloes ordered by halo mass (log[M200/M(cid:12)] indicated by rotated white numbers), where the
amount of oxygen produced and released by all galaxies within R200 is normalized to one. The relative oxygen content in stars (red), the
ISM (blue), and the CGM (within R200, bright green; at 1-2R200, faded green) is then summed relative to the total oxygen production,
as in P14. For L∗ and group haloes, there exists more oxygen in the CGM within 2R200 than in the galaxy (stars+ISM) itself. Up to
half the oxygen generated by an L∗ galaxy can be ejected beyond R200. One diﬀerence with P14 is that we sum the stellar and ISM
oxygen content for all (central & satellite) galaxies in the halo, where P14 only include the central galaxy for these quantities.

Figure 10. Top Panel: Bars indicate the ion fractions of the CGM oxygen within 2R200 in M5.3 haloes ordered by M200. This plot
normalizes the amount of CGM oxygen represented by the sum of the bright and faded green bars in Fig. 9 to one, and subdivides it into
oxygen species. Eight species (O i-O viii) are coloured, and O ix is the diﬀerence with between the end of the blue bar and the horizontal
line at a value of one. Bottom Panel: Bars indicate the ion fractions if one assumes an isothermal halo with T = Tvir and collisional
ionization equilibrium. These assumptions do not hold for simulated haloes, but the simulated O vi fractions transition at a similar halo
mass, 1012.3M(cid:12), as the isothermal fractions predict.

cause they currently reside further from the halo centre and
additionally may have fallen in at late times.

We further investigate the multi-phase structure of the
CGM by considering gas pressures at diﬀerent temperatures.
We plot pressure as a function of halo mass at 0.3 and 1.0
×R200 in Figure 11. To calculate a pressure at a given radius
and temperature, we take the median CGM gas density with
a 0.1 dex spread in radius and temperature, and compute
P/k = nHT /(XHµ), where k is the Boltzmann constant, XH
is the mass fraction of hydrogen, and µ is the mean molecular

weight. For each of our haloes, we colour the circles by tem-
perature and scale their areas in proportion to log(m/M200),
where m is the mass within the temperature/radius bin.

The ﬁrst point to note is that the CGM is multi-phase,
especially inside 0.3R200. In the L∗ range, there are copi-
ous amounts of gas at T < 105 K (purple & blue circles)
and T (cid:62) 106 K (yellow, orange, & red circles). Very lit-
tle mass exists at 105.0 and 105.5 K (cyan & green circles),
because gas cools rapidly through this temperature regime.
When the cooling times become longer at T (cid:46) 104.5 K, gas

Figure 11. Pressure as a function of halo mass in shells at 0.3× (left panel) and 1.0× R200 (right panel). Pressures are calculated at
a given radius and temperature by multiplying the median density within an 0.1 dex spread in r and T . The dashed lines indicate the
pressure of an isothermal density proﬁle at the virial temperature normalized to contain the entire baryonic content of a halo within

is at a signiﬁcantly lower pressure, which indicates this gas
is not cooling isobarically. By the time the gas reaches 104
K where cooling times are long, it becomes closer to achiev-
ing pressure equilibrium with gas with 100× more thermal
energy. Thus, the interiors of L∗ haloes inhibit long-lived
collisionally ionized, T ∼ 105.5 K, O vi owing to rapid cool-
ing through the coronal regime, as well as cool, T < 105
K, O vi owing to high pressures forcing cold gas to densi-
ties that are too high to be photo-ionized by the Haardt
& Madau (2001) background. In contrast, at R200 where
the densities are lower and the cooling times are longer, the
dominant phase is 105.5 K (green circles), where O vi is a
more eﬀective tracer of the gas.

Group haloes have pressures that are far too high to
allow long-lived O vi at any radii (cid:46) 0.5R200, although a
multi-phase CGM exists where a small amount of cold ∼ 104
K gas achieves similar pressures as much hotter ∼ 106.5 K
gas in some haloes. As for L∗ haloes, the gas at R200 is
less multi-phase, and the dominant phase is near the O vi
collisional peak temperature.
We overplot the pressures assuming the single-phase
isothermal model proﬁle where ρ ∝ r−2 and T = Tvir from
Equ. 1 with dashed lines in Fig. 11. The pressures of the
T > 105.5 K phase generally follow the approximate magni-
tude and the slope (P ∝ M 2/3
200 ) of the model, although L∗
haloes and below have lower pressures interior to 0.3R200,
which was also shown by Crain et al. (2010). Even though
the single-phase isothermal model is clearly an incomplete
description of the CGM, it provides useful insight into the
trends for O vi. The high pressures of groups prevent a sig-
niﬁcant O vi-traced gas phase. While L∗ haloes have the
correct temperature for maximizing the fraction of collision-
ally ionized O vi, O vi still only traces a signiﬁcant amount
of mass in the exteriors where the coronal cooling times
are long. Sub-L∗ haloes have pressures low enough to allow
photo-ionized O vi.

6 DISCUSSION

Our ﬁndings suggest that the O vi-sSFR correlation discov-
ered by COS-Halos is an indirect correlation, and that the
fundamental trend is O vi tracing virialized enriched gas at
temperatures close to 105.5 K, where the O vi fraction peaks.
Passive central galaxies with mass M∗ ∼ 1010.5M(cid:12) reside in
higher mass haloes than active galaxies with a similar mass.
The higher virial temperatures of the haloes hosting the pas-
sive galaxies lead to signiﬁcantly lower O vi fractions. While
the CGM metal content increases with halo mass, O vi is
not an eﬀective tracer of haloes with mass (cid:29) 1012M(cid:12). The
CGM oxygen budget cannot be directly linked to recent star
formation, which we demonstrated by showing that the typ-
ical age of O vi is greater than 5 Gyr and represents the
cumulative ejection of metals by galactic superwinds over a
Hubble time.

If the O vi were to trace metals originating from the
star formation determined through observational indicators,
then the time to travel to 150 kpc would imply a very high
outﬂow speed. A >1500 km s−1 wind is necessary to travel
this distance in <100 Myr, which is the timescale for the
observed SF indicators to be linked to recent SF. Such high-
velocity winds are rarely if at all present in our simulated
L∗ haloes at low-z, which is also supported by recent ob-
servations of outﬂows around star-forming galaxies in the
evolved Universe. A number of campaigns have observed
blue-shifted, low-ion absorption wings extending to at most
a few hundred km s−1 from the galaxy, almost always at ve-
locities unable to escape the gravitational potential of the
halo (e.g. Bouch´e et al. 2012; Martin et al. 2012; Rubin et
al. 2014; Chisholm et al. 2015; Nielsen et al. 2015).

Related to the indirect connection between CGM O vi
and galactic SF, is that the large O vi ionization correc-
tion would imply far too many metals launched in recent
outﬂows. We predict the amount of metals residing in low-

18

B. D. Oppenheimer et al.

redshift CGM reservoirs to be larger than the amount of
metals in galaxies including stars and the ISM. Despite the
high O vi column densities around L∗ galaxies, the summed
O vi ionization fractions are only 0.9 − 1.3% in CGM gas
within R200 and increase to 2.2−3.4% when including CGM
oxygen within 2R200. This is still higher than the global
IGM O vi correction of ∼ 1% reported by Rahmati et al.
(2015b) for the EAGLE 100 Mpc box at low-z. Assuming
xO vi = 20% thus severely under-estimates the CGM oxy-
gen content. This is not surprising since collisionally ionized
O vi has a very small temperature range around 105.5 K
where it approaches its maximal xO vi of ≈ 20%.
We emphasize the dramatic decline O vi takes as one
transitions from L∗ to group haloes, and note the strength
of the NO vi−M200 correlation. The average O vi absorption
within 150 kpc for every L∗ halo in the range of 1011.7 <
M200 < 1012.2M(cid:12) is higher than for every group halo in the
range 1012.6 < M200 < 1013.3M(cid:12), where each subsample
contains more than ten haloes. The O vi column densities
within 150 kpc decline by a factor of 5 when considering
isolated galaxies, and by a factor of 3.5 when considering
all galaxies, when transitioning from L∗ to group haloes.
In contrast, the oxygen columns within 150 kpc increase by
nearly a factor of 3 for the isolated sample and by more than
a factor of 4.5 for all galaxies moving to higher mass. Hence,
the average O vi ionization fraction for the CGM inside R200
is almost a factor of 20 lower for group-sized haloes, such
that xO vi ∼ 0.1%.

6.1 Shortfall of halo O vi around L∗ galaxies

The inability of our simulated ions to reproduce the higher
O vi column densities observed by COS-Halos around blue
L∗ galaxies is worth discussing in greater depth. As noted
in §4, we ﬁnd about 2× too little O vi within 150 kpc using
the M5.3 zooms, with the greatest deviation being within
75 kpc (≈ 3×). We now discuss several possibilities of why
there may be such a shortfall.
We note that our stellar masses are too low by a factor
of ∼ 2 in these zooms compared with abundance matching
constraints. In Appendix B, we explore the higher resolu-
tion M4.4 zooms, ﬁnding that O vi is slightly stronger (0.06
dex) around L∗ galaxies, but the stellar masses decline by
0.18 dex making a (cid:38) 3× discrepancy with abundance match-
ing. Recalibrating the EAGLE model is necessary at higher
resolution, and it may be that through the generation of
more stars, more oxygen is produced and ejected into the
CGM, which creates even higher O vi column densities than
in the M4.4 zooms. Indeed, Rahmati et al. (2015b) found
that across diﬀerent EAGLE models, the integrated metal
ion column density distributions scaled nearly linearly with
the integrated stellar mass.

Another possibility is that the low stellar masses in our
M5.3 zooms could lead to a mismatched selection of over-
massive haloes, where we have shown O vi to be weaker.
To test this hypothesis, we run SMOHALOS where we ar-
tiﬁcially increase the M5.3 stellar masses by 0.3 dex in ac-
cordance with abundance matching constraints, and ﬁnd es-
sentially no diﬀerence in the median O vi column densities.
Hence, this cannot explain the O vi shortfall.

A third possibility is that the original COS-Halos
galaxy-selected sample exhibits Malmquist bias, which we

cannot replicate using SMOHALOS applied to a limited set
of zoom haloes. The COS-Halos galaxies were selected pho-
tometrically, which can lead to a biased sample of higher
star-forming and/or more massive galaxies from a Schechter
function. While SMOHALOS attempts to match galaxies
based on M∗ and sSFR, we do not have a large enough
sample to reproduce the high SFRs observed in COS-Halos
(Werk et al. 2012). For example, 3% of SMOHALOS galax-
ies have SFR> 3.0M(cid:12)yr−1 compared to 18% of COS-Halos,
and we have no galaxies with SFR> 5.0 M(cid:12)yr−1 compared
to 8% of the COS-Halos. Hence, we may not produce the
O vi absorption columns observed in COS-Halos, because
we are not simulating the right galaxies.

Finally, we assume a slowly evolving extra-galactic
background (Haardt & Madau 2001) without any local
sources of ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation from nearby
star formation can increase O vi columns as demonstrated
by Vasiliev et al. (2015) who found that xO vi can reach
0.4− 0.9 and reproduce COS-Halos O vi observations, albeit
under speciﬁcally chosen conditions conducive to the photo-
ionization of O vi. This model could invalidate our conclu-
sion that O vi traces the virial temperature of L∗ haloes and
not that of group haloes, because photo-ionization requires
< 105 K gas, although it could be argued that both cold gas
and ionizing photons from star formation decline in group
haloes. Suresh et al. (2015b) show that O vi can be signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced by local sources of ionizing radiation, but
only within 50 kpc using a 100% escape fraction for soft X-
rays from a SFR=10M(cid:12)yr−1 galaxy, which are unrealistic
assumptions for COS-Halos.
However, we suggest

the possibility that photo-
ionization of O vi could be part of the solution, owing to
ﬂuctuating AGN “ﬂash” ionizing their CGM. Oppenheimer
& Schaye (2013b) introduced the concept of AGN proximity
zone fossils, where “cool” 104 K gas is ionized by a halo’s
central AGN that subsequently turns oﬀ leaving the sur-
rounding CGM over-ionized for a time similar to the re-
combination timescale of diﬀuse gas, which can equal or ex-
ceed the typical time between AGN episodes. They showed
that Seyfert-level AGN that are on for 10% of the time can
enhance O vi levels by > 1 dex after the AGN turns oﬀ.
The eﬀect may be particularly relevant for cool metals at
nH = 10−3 − 10−4cm−3 where CGM metals exist in our
simulations, and the relevant recombination timescales for
O vi range from 2 − 20 Myrs. Thus a short Seyfert “burst”
lasting ∼ 0.1 − 1 Myr within the past ∼ 10 − 20 Myr can
enhance O vi at the expense of lower oxygen ions, which nor-
mally trace this gas in equilibrium with the Haardt & Madau
(2001) ﬁeld. The COS-Halos galaxies do not show AGN ac-
tivity (Werk et al. 2012) and are thus in the oﬀ-phase. The
O vi nearer to the AGN should be more enhanced by the
proximity zone fossil eﬀect, which would agree with COS-
Halos data showing O vi increasing at small impact param-
eter more steeply than our SMOHALOS realizations. This
hypothesis requires a signiﬁcant fraction of COS-Halos blue
galaxies to be recent AGN.

6.2 Eﬀect of AGN Feedback

To test the impact of AGN thermal feedback (i.e. not the
proximity fossil eﬀect discussed above) on CGM O vi, we run
a single group halo (Grp004), which has M200 = 1012.89M(cid:12)

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

at z = 0.205, turning oﬀ SMBH growth and AGN feedback.
This halo is the most frequently selected SMOHALOS pas-
sive galaxy. Figure 12 compares 600 kpc snapshots of the
standard run on the left versus the “NoAGN” model on the
right in the same sequence as Fig. 2. While stellar feedback
still operates in the NoAGN run, the galaxy is 2.8× more
massive. There exists 2.8× more hydrogen and 2.7× more
oxygen in the CGM inside R200 in the NoAGN model (cf. top
two sets of panels). The values of (cid:104)NO(cid:105)150 are 1016.19 and
1016.65cm−2 with and without AGN respectively, reﬂecting
the nearly factor of 3 increase in CGM oxygen in NoAGN
group haloes.
Considering the O vi column densities in the third set
of panels, there exists 1.9× more O vi within R200, but there
is substantially less (8×) O vi within a radial distance of 100
kpc in the NoAGN model. The values of (cid:104)NO vi(cid:105)150 happen
to be very similar, 1013.26 and 1013.35cm−2 with and without
AGN, respectively, which are both typical O vi columns for
our simulated groups. Combined with the oxygen aperture
columns, we show xO vi is much lower in the NoAGN model
(bottom panels), especially at small impact parameters. Our
ﬁndings for this halo agree with the global IGM statistics
of Rahmati et al. (2015b) showing only small diﬀerences be-
tween the Ref and NoAGN models, which we further discuss
in Appendix B.

In contrast to Suresh et al. (2015b), who argue that the
decline of O vi around passive versus star-forming galaxies
of the same stellar mass owes primarily to AGN feedback
removing mass from the haloes of passive galaxies, our ex-
ploration indicates that it is primarily an ionization eﬀect
that reduces O vi columns. Passive COS-Halos galaxies re-
side in higher mass haloes than their active counterparts,
which have virial temperatures that are too high for O vi.
Our NoAGN halo has almost 3× as many stars in the central
galaxy and CGM metals within R200 as the standard run,
but, almost coincidentally, a similar amount of O vi owing
to the lower xO vi as a result of having less 105−6 K gas
in the inner halo. Another big diﬀerence is that the NoAGN
run has a SFR= 6.8M(cid:12)yr−1, which creates a type of isolated
galaxy rarely observed in the z (cid:46) 0.2 Universe.

7 SUMMARY

We have run a set of EAGLE zoom simulations to confront
the O vi observations within 150 kpc of z = 0.15− 0.35 star-
forming and passive galaxies from the Tumlinson et al (2011)
COS-Halos observational campaign. Our main simulations
use the same model and resolution as the EAGLE Recal-
L025N0752 run, but include the non-equilibrium ionization
and cooling module introduced by Oppenheimer & Schaye
(2013a) and Richings et al. (2014), which we activate at low
redshifts. Twenty zoom simulations, focusing on L∗ haloes
(M200 = 1011.7 − 1012.3M(cid:12)) hosting star-forming galaxies,
and group-sized haloes (M200 = 1012.7 − 1013.3M(cid:12)) mostly
hosting passive galaxies, are simulated to z = 0 with the
NEQ module activated at z = 0.50 and 0.28 for the L∗ and
group haloes, respectively. Our main results are as follows:
• Our simulations reproduce the observed correlation of
circumgalactic O vi column density and sSFR (Figs. 7, 8).
• The bimodality of the O vi column density, with higher
column densities around star-forming galaxies than around

scription (left) and without AGN feedback model (right) in the
same format as Fig. 2. From top-to-bottom, 600 kpc snapshots of
hydrogen, oxygen, and O vi columns are shown as well as the O vi
ionization fraction. The NoAGN halo has M200 = 1012.97M(cid:12),
compared to 1012.89M(cid:12) with AGN feedback due to weaker feed-
back, but we use a constant R200 = 387 kpc when comparing
virial quantities.

passive galaxies, owes to the temperature of the virialized
halo gas. The virial temperature of L∗ haloes overlaps with
the temperature at which collisionally ionized O vi peaks
(T ∼ 105.5 K), while virial temperatures of group-sized
haloes are too high to be traced by O vi (e.g. Figs. 4, 6).
• There is no direct link between star formation in the
central galaxy and the O vi out to 150 kpc. The median age
of the oxygen traced by O vi in the CGM is > 5 Gyrs, and

20

B. D. Oppenheimer et al.

represents the accumulation of circumgalactic metals over
the entire star formation history of the galaxy.
• The global O vi fractions of our L∗ haloes range be-
tween xO vi = 0.9 − 1.3%, which means that far more oxy-
gen exists in other ionization states, both lower and higher
than O vi. Most O vi observed around L∗ galaxies observed
at impact parameters b < 150 kpc is at physical separations
of r = 200 − 500 kpc (≈ 1 − 2R200) from the galaxy. The
global L∗ xO vi rises to 2.2− 3.4% when considering oxygen
out to 2× R200, owing to optimal ionization O vi conditions
at ≈ 1 − 2R200 (Figs. 6, 10).
• Group haloes hosting passive galaxies often have global
xO vi ∼ 0.01% inside R200, and the majority of circumgalac-
tic oxygen is completely ionized (O ix). Group haloes have
average column densities of NO vi = 1013.7cm−2 for b < 150
kpc, which mostly arises from gas beyond R200. This column
density is 3.5× lower than for L∗ haloes (1014.2cm−2). Ap-
plying isolation criteria similar to COS-Halos galaxies, the
mean O vi column density around group centrals falls to
NO vi = 1013.5cm−2, which is 5× lower than for isolated
L∗ haloes. Despite the low O vi column densities in groups,
there exists 3× more oxygen within a 150 kpc aperture than
for L∗ haloes.
• Our simulated L∗ haloes have O vi column densities
that are ∼ 2× too low compared to COS-Halos observations
at b < 150 kpc, and 3× at b < 75 kpc. This could be re-
lated to an underproduction of total oxygen as our L∗ stellar
masses are 2× too low relative to abundance matching con-
straints. Increased photo-ionization, possibly from proximity
zone fossils due to ﬂuctuating AGN (Oppenheimer & Schaye
2013b), are an unconsidered source that could increase the
O vi ion fraction.
• The majority of the oxygen produced and released by
stars is ejected by superwind feedback beyond the optical ex-
tent of the galaxy, such that more oxygen exists in the CGM
within 2R200 than in the galactic component (stars+ISM).
The progenitors of L∗ galaxies can eject more than half of
their oxygen beyond R200 by z = 0.2, although the fraction
of oxygen remaining within R200 (stars+ISM+CGM) aver-
ages 62% and 69% for L∗ and group haloes respectively. En-
richment at large radii primarily occurs at high z, especially
for group haloes, when gravitational potentials were shal-
lower and ﬁxed comoving distances were physically smaller
(Figs. 6, 9).
• O vii is the most abundant oxygen ion in the CGM for
haloes between M200 = 1011.8 − 1013.0M(cid:12), with between 23
and 50% of the circumgalactic oxygen inside 2×R200 ionized
to O vii. This is a factor of 8 − 20 (60 − 190) higher than
O vi in L∗ (group) haloes (Fig. 10).
• We explore the role of AGN by running a 1012.9M(cid:12)
group halo without AGN feedback, ﬁnding that it produces
similar O vi column densities at b < 150 kpc (1013.3cm−2)
as our standard group haloes with AGN feedback. Hence,
the bimodality of circumgalactic O vi column densities with
sSFR does not owe to the removal of mass and metals from
the haloes of galaxies with more active black holes, but is
clearly an ionization eﬀect of reduced xO vi in hot haloes
(Fig. 12).

In our simulations, the higher O vi column densities
around star-forming galaxies compared with passive galax-
ies are due to their virial temperatures being more favorable

for a high O vi fraction rather than to higher total oxygen
column densities. A key test of this explanation would be to
observe our prediction of the greater total oxygen content
in the CGM of higher mass haloes, where O vi is no longer
an eﬀective tracer of CGM oxygen. Observing the soft X-
ray ions O vii and O viii out to the virial radius is beyond
the scope of current facilities, although we will make predic-
tions for upcoming facilities in future work. Unfortunately,
absorption lines capable of tracing > 106 K metals are at
extreme UV energies, which shifts them out of the COS
wavelength coverage at low redshift.

Our model contrasts with that of Suresh et al. (2015b),
who predict that AGN blow more baryons out of haloes
around passive than star-forming galaxies, and therefore will
not predict more metals at b (cid:46) 150 kpc around passive
galaxies. Alternatively, photo-ionization by galactic sources
(e.g. Oppenheimer & Schaye 2013b; Vasiliev et al. 2015) in-
stead predicts that the O vi bearing material would exist in
∼ 104 K gas around galaxies.

Our results indicate that O vi acts as a sensitive ther-
mometer of halo gas, such that the O vi column den-
sity around star-forming and passive galaxies informs more
about temperature than about the oxygen mass.

APPENDIX A: NON-EQUILIBRIUM EFFECTS

Non-equilibrium eﬀects are generally small when consider-
ing circumgalactic O vi within 150 kpc exposed to a slowly
evolving ionization background such as that speciﬁed by
Haardt & Madau (2001). Figure A1 shows the O vi column
density in the equilibrium runs (cyan) and the NEQ runs
(grey) at z = 0.205. The bottom panel shows that the diﬀer-
ences are small– equilibrium zooms have +0.01 and +0.02
dex greater columns than NEQ zooms for L∗ and group
haloes respectively. The scatter is larger for group haloes
with smaller O vi columns, where an episodic ﬂuctuation can
make a larger diﬀerence. Galaxy properties (M∗ and sSFR)
are indistinguishable between the two sets of simulations.

Our results appear to agree with Cen & Fang (2006) and
Yoshikawa & Sasaki (2006), who ﬁnd that non-equilibrium
eﬀects matter for O vi mainly in the low-density, diﬀuse IGM
where collisional ionization timescales become long com-
pared to the timescales on which gas is shocked. One caveat

Figure A1. O vi aperture column densities within 150 kpc for our
standard NEQ runs at z = 0.205 (grey, a repeat of the left panel
of Fig. 4), and runs with equilibrium ionization and cooling (cyan)
with the diﬀerences relative to the standard NEQ runs shown on
the bottom panel (for each halo there are 3 circles corresponding
to 3 projections). Thick lines of the same colour in the top panel
are binned averages. The runs diverge at z = 0.503 for L∗ haloes
and z = 0.282 for all but one group halo when the NEQ module
is activated for the NEQ runs. Except for some high-mass haloes,
the diﬀerences are small.

is that we may underestimate the NEQ eﬀects, because SPH
smooths out shocks (Hutchings & Thomas 2000; Creasey et
al. 2011). Our simulations ﬁnd that non-equilibrium ioniza-
tion and cooling under a slowly evolving ionization back-
ground such as Haardt & Madau (2001) do not signiﬁcantly
alter the O vi CGM statistics, and will further explore non-
equilibrium eﬀects in such simulations in a future paper.

APPENDIX B: RESOLUTION TESTS AND
COMPARISONS WITH LARGE VOLUMES

We compare our results to higher and lower resolution sim-
ulations, using both our zooms and other periodic EA-
GLE runs. We consider stellar masses relative to abundance
matching constraints in Figure B1 and 150 kpc aperture O vi
column densities in Figure B2.

B1 Metal smoothing at the same resolution

We ﬁrst compare matched haloes at the same resolution in
the M5.3 L∗ zooms (grey) and in Recal-L025N0752 (yellow,
the diﬀerence with the grey circles indicated in the bottom
panel). This comparison tests the eﬀect of SPH-smoothing

mass for our standard NEQ runs at z = 0.205 (in grey) and for

tion (M5.3), the higher resolution M4.4 zooms (red), and the
lower resolution M6.2 zooms (blue). We also compare to the
matched haloes in Ref-L025N0376 (green) and Ref-L100N1504
(dark green). The outputs for EAGLE volumes are at z = 0.187,
and the abundance matching constraints from Behroozi et al.
(2013, solid green) and Moster et al. (2013, dashed red) are at
z = 0.2. The top panel shows the absolute values (circles) and
binned averages (thick lines), and the bottom panel shows diﬀer-
ences relative to the M5.3 zooms (grey circles in top panel).

of elemental abundances, which is done in Recal-L025N0752
but not in the zooms as discussed in §2.3.3. The other diﬀer-
ences between these two runs are NEQ versus equilibrium,
which was covered in the previous Appendix and is insignif-
icant for M∗ and (cid:104)NO vi(cid:105)150, as well as the zoom method.
We ﬁnd 0.15 dex higher stellar masses for L∗ galaxies in
Recal-L025N0752, which closely matches the 0.11 dex higher
stellar masses we ﬁnd in ﬁve M5.3 smoothed-metallicity
zooms. The O vi columns are essentially unchanged, being
0.03 dex lower in Recal-L025N0752. Hence, metal smooth-
ing slightly increases stellar masses but barely alters O vi
CGM columns. This test also shows that our zooms do not
statistically deviate from their parent simulations, so that
our zoom results also hold for the EAGLE volumes. There-
fore, we can compare our results directly to Rahmati et al.
(2015b) for global IGM metal statistics when they use Recal-
L025N0752.

B2 Resolution tests

We have run all M5.3 zooms from the Recal-L025N0752 box
at M4.4 resolution using the same parameters (Recal pre-

our standard NEQ runs at z = 0.205 for the same runs as shown
in Fig. B1, showing a range of 64 (4) in mass (spatial) resolution.
The aperture is centred on the galaxy coordinates given in each
respective simulation (zoom and EAGLE volume). The top panel

scription and particle-metallicities; red), which we show in
both Figs. B1 and B2. These runs, listed in Table B2, con-
stitute a strong convergence test (S15), and better agree-
ment is potentially achievable with recalibrated parame-
ters. Seven out of 10 M4.4 zooms are run in NEQ from
z = 0.503 to at least z = 0.205, but the NEQ results are
nearly identical to the equilibrium one. The large Gal010
zoom was run in equilibrium only, and provides 3 individ-
ual M200 = 1012.4 − 1012.7M(cid:12) z = 0.205 haloes to test if
the decline in O vi above L∗ persists at this higher reso-
lution. We also ran a set of M6.2 zooms using Recal and
particle-metallicities (blue) for nine galaxies in four zooms,
also listed in Table B2.
For L∗ haloes, the M4.4 zooms have 0.06 dex higher
O vi columns despite having 0.18 dex lower stellar masses
as mentioned in §6.1. This means that a greater proportion
of the oxygen formed in higher resolution simulations (since
oxygen production ∝ M∗) appears as O vi within 150 kpc of
the galaxy. The decline of O vi above M200 > 1012.3M(cid:12) how-
ever is robust with the three Gal010 haloes (M200 = 1012.42,
1012.58, and 1012.69M(cid:12)) showing a considerable decline in
O vi columns relative to L∗ masses. These three haloes have
O vi columns averaging 1013.79cm−2, which is 3× lower than
the M4.4 L∗ columns– 1014.31cm−2, and the same decline as
seen in the M5.3 zooms. Hence, the conclusion that O vi
traces the virial temperature of L∗ haloes and therefore de-

clines at higher masses is corroborated by these 8× better
mass resolution simulations. Nevertheless, the M4.4 zooms
underpredict abundance matching constraints by a factor of
∼ 3, which implies that the stellar feedback indeed needs to
be recalibrated at M4.4 resolution to inject less energy in or-
der to create galaxies of the same stellar mass in the L∗ mass
range. This is likely a consequence of improved numerical ef-
ﬁciency of our stochastic thermal feedback implemented at
the higher resolution.

The M6.2 zooms are the only galaxies run at this resolu-
tion using the Recal prescription, because L100N1504 uses
the Ref parameter values. In the L∗ range, galaxy stellar
masses are on average 0.09 dex higher than M5.3 while
the O vi columns are 0.06 dex lower. This continues the
trend seen with the M4.4 zooms of a greater proportion
of oxygen produced by stars showing up as O vi within
150 kpc at higher resolution. The decline in O vi above
M200 = 1012.3M(cid:12) persists at M6.2 resolution. This trend
is robust at all three resolutions, indicating a decline by a
factor of (cid:38) 3 in O vi columns from L∗ to group haloes.

B3 Comparison to EAGLE volumes

In the previous section, we compared our results in the
“strong convergence” regime, deﬁned by S15 as not changing
the subgrid models across diﬀerent resolutions, using the Re-
cal prescription. However, to compare to the main EAGLE
simulations that use the “Ref” model at M6.2 resolution, we
cross-reference the L∗ (1011.7 − 1012.3M(cid:12)) haloes at M5.3
resolution to Ref-L025N0376 (green in Figs. B1 and B2)
and the group (1012.7 − 1013.3M(cid:12)) haloes to Ref-L100N1504
(dark green) to perform a test of “weak convergence” where
the subgrid models are changed. This allows us to verify
our higher resolution zoom results to the much larger sam-
ple from the EAGLE volumes, which are used throughout
many EAGLE papers including Rahmati et al. (2015b).
Relative to our M5.3 zooms, the Ref model has L∗
(group) stellar masses that are 0.21 (0.31) dex higher, while
O vi columns are 0.24 (0.06) dex lower. The Ref model better
matches the abundance matching constraints (by design),
while our zooms have the additional diﬀerence of using par-
ticle rather than smoothed-SPH metallicities on top of the
weak convergence comparison of the standard Ref and Re-
cal prescriptions. The decline from L∗ to group haloes for
log[(cid:104)NO vi(cid:105)150/cm−2] is smaller (13.96 to 13.56) than in the

matched M5.3 zooms (14.20 to 13.62), but still signiﬁcant.
To generalize these statistics to all haloes in the EAGLE
Ref volumes, we ﬁnd the average log[(cid:104)NO vi(cid:105)150/cm−3] in
L∗ (group) haloes using Ref-L025N0376 (Ref-L100N1504)
of (13.83) 13.61, where each sample contains at least 50
haloes. While the decline is still apparent, it is smaller at
the Ref resolution. We also used the intermediate-sized Ref-
L050N0752 box to ﬁnd 13.83 (13.66) for 294 (52) L∗ (group)
haloes. However, it must be noted that this sample includes
all the haloes in 0.6 dex M200 bins, which biases each bin
to be dominated by haloes at the lower mass end of the
bin (where there are more haloes) as opposed to the zooms
chosen to more evenly sample the masses within these bins.
Indeed, making the M200 bins smaller (0.3 dex wide) in Ref-
L050N0752, leads to a slightly greater decline from 13.89 to
13.61.
The L∗ O vi columns are considerably smaller at

all L∗ haloes in Recal-L025N0752 ﬁnding (cid:104)NO vi(cid:105)150 =
1014.09cm−2, which is 0.26 dex higher than for Ref-

resolution simulations. While group halo O vi columns ap-
pear to not change much in the weak convergence limit,
the O vi columns in L∗ haloes are signiﬁcantly higher in
the Recal simulations, which aﬀects both COS-Halos type
observations and global IGM observations (Rahmati et al.
2015b).

consider

haloes, which compares to 13.83 (13.66) in Ref-L050N0752.
Thus, the conclusion that AGN are not responsible for the
reduction of O vi columns with mass as discussed in §6.2,
holds also for this larger sample of group haloes, and the
diﬀerence in O vi column density is actually stronger in the
absence of AGN. Globally, there exists more O vi in the
NoAGN models (Rahmati et al. 2015b), which likely owes
to L∗ haloes hosting more O vi while group haloes harbour
less O vi within 150 kpc despite forming twice as many
stars.
