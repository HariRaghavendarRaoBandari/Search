Iterated Functions Systems, Blenders and Parablenders

Pierre Berger, Sylvain Crovisier, Enrique Pujals∗

February 30, 2016

Abstract

We recast the notion of parablender introduced in [B] as a parametric IFS. This is done
using the concept of open covering property and looking to parametric IFS as systems acting
on jets.

Iterated Functions Systems

Deﬁnition 1. A (contracting) Iterated Functions System (IFS) is the data of a ﬁnite family (fb)b∈B
of contracting maps on Rn. The IFS is of class C r, r ≥ 1, if each fb is of class C r.

The topology on the set of IFS of class C r (with Card B elements) is given by the product strong

topology QB C r(Rn, Rn). The limit set of an IFS is:

Λ := {x ∈ Rn : ∃(bi)i ∈ BZ−

, x = lim

fb−1 ◦ · · · ◦ fb−k(0)}.

k→+∞

The limit set Λ is compact. One is usually interested in its geometry. Natural questions are:

Question 2. Under which condition the limit set Λ has non-empty interior?
Under which condition the limit set has C r-robustly non empty interior ?

Let us recall that a system satisﬁes a property C r-robustly if the property holds also for any
C r-perturbations of the system. Both questions are still open, although there are already partial
answers to them. Let us state a classical suﬃcient property:

Deﬁnition 3. The IFS (fb)b∈B satisﬁes the covering property if there exists a non-empty open set
U of Rn such that:

Closure(U ) ⊂ [b∈B

fb(U ).

Example 4. For λ ∈ (1/2, 1), the IFS spanned by the two following one-dimensional maps

f1 : x 7→ λx + 1,

f−1 : x 7→ λx − 1,

satisﬁes the covering property since [−2, 2] ⊂ φ1((−2, 2)) ∪ φ−1((−2, 2)).

∗This work is partially supported by the project BRNUH of Sorbonne Paris Cit´e University and the French-

Brazilian network.

One easily proves the following:

Proposition 5. If the IFS (fb)b∈B satisﬁes the covering property with the open set U , then the
limit set of the IFS contains C 1-robustly U .

Hence the covering property is a suﬃcient condition for an IFS to have C r-robustly non-empty

interior, for every r ≥ 1.

Question 6. Is the covering property a necessary condition to have C r-robustly non-empty interior?

This question is not known even when n = 1. It is not clear to us that the answer would be
independent of r. Indeed there are phenomena which occur for r > 1 and not for r = 1, such as
the stable intersection of regular cantor set [MY, N, M].

Nevertheless the case n = 1 and Card B = 2 is simple. Indeed consider the IFS generated by
two contracting maps f1, f2 of R. Let I be the convex hull of Λ: the endpoints of I are the ﬁxed
points of f1 and f2. If the interiors of f1(I) and f2(I) are disjoint, then a small perturbation makes
f1(I) and f2(I) disjoint. Then it is easy to see that the IFS has empty interior. Otherwise the
interiors of f1(I) and f2(I) are not disjoint. They cannot coincide since the interior of I is non
empty and f1, f2 are contracting. By removing the ǫ-neighborhood of the endpoints of I, one gets
an interval Iǫ which is covered by the images by f1 and f2 of its interior. Consequently, if Λ has
robustly non empty interior it must satisfy the covering property.

IFS with parameters

We denote Ik = [−1, 1]k. One considers C r parametrized families inside the Banach space C r(Rn, Rn):
these are elements (fa)a∈Ik in C r(Ik, C r(Rn, Rn)).

For each parameter a0 ∈ Ik, one introduces the jet space J r

a0(Ik, Rn), whose elements are the
axa)|a=a0 at a = a0 of C r functions a 7→ xa in C r(Ik, Rn). Each C r

Taylor series (xa, ∂axa, . . . , ∂r

family of map (fa)a∈Ik ∈ C r(Ik, C r(Rr, Rr)) acts on the space of jets as a map bf deﬁned by:

axa)|a=a0 7→ (fa(xa), ∂a(fa(xa)), . . . , ∂r

a(fa(xa)))|a=a0 .

bf : (xa, ∂axa, . . . , ∂r

Our goal is to study parametrized IFS:

Deﬁnition 7. An Iterated Functions System (IFS) with parameter is the data of a ﬁnite families
(fb,a)b∈B of contracting maps on Rn depending on a parameter a ∈ Ik.

The IFS with parameter is of class C r, r ≥ 1, if each (fb,a)a∈Ik is in C r(Ik, C r(Rn, Rn)).

For every a ∈ Ik, we consider the limit set Λa associated to the system (fb,a)b∈B equal to the set
. These points admit

of points Xa(b) := limk→+∞ fb−1,a ◦ · · · ◦ fb−k,a(0), among all b = (bi)i ∈ BZ−
a continuation when a varies: each function a 7→ Xa(b) is of class C r. One can consider its jet:

J r
a0 X(b) := (Xa(b), ∂aXa(b), . . . , ∂r

aXa(b))|a=a0 .

It is natural to wonder if the following set has (robustly) non-empty interior:

We notice that if J r

0 Λ has non empty interior, then there exists a non-empty open subset U ⊂

C r(Ik, Rn) such that for every (xa)a∈Ik ∈ U there is b ∈ BZ−

satisfying:

xa = Xa(b) + o(kakr) .

3 The covering property for an aﬃne IFS acting on the jet space

In this note we study a simple IFS with parameter. We set k = n = 1 and choose r ≥ 1. Let:

f+1,a : x 7→ λax + 1,

f−1,a : x 7→ λax − 1,

where (λa)a∈I ∈ C r(I, (−1, 1)) satisﬁes (∂aλa)|a=0 6= 0.

Remark 9. Any system in an open and dense set of parametrized IFS generated by a pair of
contracting aﬃne maps with the same contraction, can be conjugated as a system which coincides
with (f+1,a, f−1,a) for a close to 0.

As k = 1, after coordinate change on the parameter space, we can also assume that λa = λ + a

for a in a neighborhood of 0. Note that the maps induced on r-jet space J r

0 (I, R) are now:

axa)|a=0 7→ (λxa + 1, λ∂axa + xa, . . . , λ∂r

axa + r∂r−1

a xa)|a=0.

axa)|a=0 7→ (λxa − 1, λ∂axa + xa, . . . , λ∂r

axa + r∂r−1

a xa)|a=0.

bf+1 : (xa, ∂axa, . . . , ∂r
bf−1 : (xa, ∂axa, . . . , ∂r

adapt their proof to obtain the following stronger result.

In [HS1, HS2], its is proved that the IFS generated by (bf+1, bf−1) has non empty interior. Let us
Theorem A. For any r ≥ 1, if λ ∈ (0, 1) is close enough to 1, then the IFS generated by (bf+1, bf−1)

0 (I, R) satisﬁes the open covering property.

acting on the r-jet space J r

Corollary 10. Any IFS with parameter generated by two families of maps C r-close to (f+1,a)a and
(f−1,a)a induces an IFS on the r-jet space J r

0 (I, R) whose limit set has non-empty interior.

Proof of theorem A. Let us remark that the IFS generated by (bf+1, bf−1) is conjugated (via aﬃne

coordinates change) to the IFS on RN , N = r + 1, generated by the maps

F+1 : X 7→ JX + T, F−1 : X 7→ JX − T,

where T = (0, . . . , 0, 1) and

i=0 |ai| < 2 and (x − 1)N |Q(x). Dividing by some xk, one can assumes that a0 6= 0.
One then sets P (x) = λ−nQ(λ · x). Provided λ is close enough to 1, it satisﬁes the conditions
(i)–(iii). In order to check the last item, it is enough to check that the following matrix has rank

The two ﬁrst conditions can be obtained as in [HS2] (even if the inequality in the ﬁrst condition

is strict). The last condition can be obtained by dividing P by x if necessary.

Let S−1, S1 be the linear automorphisms of Rn deﬁned for δ ∈ {+1, −1} by:

Before proving the proposition, one checks easily the following relations.

Proposition 15. The subset A is open and satisﬁes: Closure(A) ⊂ F−1(A) ∪ F1(A).

Proof. The linear map π is open since it has rank N . Since π sends compact sets to compact sets,
it is enough to prove

π(Closure(∆)) ⊂ F+1 ◦ π(∆) ∪ F−1 ◦ π(∆).

By Proposition 12, one has to check the following inclusion:

Closure(∆) ⊂ S+1(∆) ∪ S−1(∆).

Consider any point (u−n, . . . , u−1) in Closure(∆). By our choice of η and since |uj| ≤ ηN
for each −n ≤ j ≤ −1, there exists u0 ∈ (−η, η) and δ ∈ {−1, 1} satisfying the relation u0 =
j=0 bjuj−n. One deduces that the sequence (u−n+1, . . . , u−1, u0) belongs to ∆. Since bn = 1,
j=0 bjuj−n = δ, so that Sδ(u−n+1, . . . , u−1, u0) = (u−n, . . . , u−1). This proves the required

inclusion.

The covering property is thus satisﬁed and the Theorem is proved.

4 Blenders for endomorphisms

Our motivations for studying the action of IFS on jet spaces come from hyperbolic diﬀerentiable
dynamics, and more speciﬁcally from the study of blenders and para-blenders that we explain in
these two last sections.

If f : M → M is a C 1-map on a manifold M , a compact subset K ⊂ M is hyperbolic if:

– f is a local diﬀeomorphism on a neighborhood of K,

– K is stable (i.e. f (K) ⊂ K),

– there exists an invariant subbundle Es ⊂ T M|K and N ≥ 1 so that ∀x ∈ K:

Dxf (Es

x) ⊂ Es

f (x),

kDxf N |Es

xk < 1,

kpEs

⊥ ◦ (Dxf N )−1(u)k < 1,

∀u ∈ Es

⊥,x,

where Es

⊥,x is the orthogonal complement of Es

x and pEs

⊥ the orthogonal projection onto it.

Note that the map f is in general not invertible. Hence one can deﬁne an unstable space at any
x ∈ K, but it is in general not unique: it depends on the choice of a preorbit of x. We recall that
the inverse limit

←−
K is the set of preorbits:

←−
K := {(xi)i≤0 ∈ K Z−

: f (xi) = xi+1, ∀i < 0}.

The map f induces a map

←−
f : (xi) 7→ (f (xi)) on

←−
K .

For every preorbit x = (xi)i≤0 ∈

←−
K and for every ǫ > 0 small enough, the following set is a

submanifold of dimension Codim(Es):

W u(x, ǫ) = {x′ ∈ M : ∃x′ ∈

←−
K s.t. x′

0 = x′, ∀i d(x′

i, xi) < ǫ and lim
i→−∞

d(x′

i, xi) = 0},

and is called local unstable manifold (also denoted by W u(x, ǫ, f ) when one speciﬁes the map f ).

We recall that K is inverse-limit stable: for every C 1-perturbation f ′ of f , there exists a unique

that the following diagram commutes:

f .

Moreover πf ′(

←−
K ) is hyperbolic for f ′ and is called the hyperbolic continuation of K for f ′.

The notion of blender was ﬁrst introduced in the invertible setting by [BD1] to construct robustly
transitive diﬀeomorphisms, and then [BD2, DNP] to construct locally generic diﬀeomorphism with
inﬁnitely many sinks. The work [B] deals with blenders for endomorphisms.

Deﬁnition 16. A C r-blender for a C r-endomorphism is a hyperbolic set K such that the union of
its local unstable manifolds has C r-robustly a non-empty interior: there exists a non-empty open set
U ⊂ M which is contained in the union of the local unstable manifolds of the hyperbolic continuation
of K for any endomorphism f ′ C r-close to f .

The classical deﬁnition for diﬀeomorphisms is more general: ﬁxing an integer d smaller than
the stable dimension of K, it asserts that there exists an open collection U of embeddings of the
d-dimensional disc in M such that any D ∈ U intersects the union of the local unstable manifolds
of the hyperbolic continuation of K for any diﬀeomorphism f ′ C r-close to f .

Example 17. For λ ∈ (1/2, 1), we consider a local diﬀeomorphism f of R2 whose restriction to
([−2, −1] ∪ [1, 2]) × [−1/(1 − λ), 1/(1 − λ)] is:

(x, y) 7→ (4|x| − 6, λy + sgn(x)),

where sgn(x) is equal to ±1 following the sign of x. The set of points (x, y) whose iterates are all
contained in ([−2, −1] ∪ [1, 2]) × [−1/(1 − λ), 1/(1 − λ)] is a hyperbolic set K which is a C 1-blender.

Proof. Note that K is locally maximal: any orbit (xn, yn)n∈Z contained in a small neighborhood
of ([−2, −1] ∪ [1, 2]) × [−1/(1 − λ), 1/(1 − λ)] belongs to K. For diﬀeomorphisms C 1-close, such an
orbit is contained in the hyperbolic continuation of K.

For η > 0 small, let ∆η := ([−2 − η, −1 + η] ∪ [1 − η, 2 + η]) × [−2, 2]. For every C 1-perturbation

f ′ of f , it holds:

f ′(Interior(∆η)) ⊃ [−2 − η, 2 + η] × [−2, 2] .

Hence every point (x, y) ∈ [−2, 2] × [−2, 2] admits an f ′-preorbit (x, y) = (xn, yn)n<0 in ∆η. It
loc(z, f ′) and this shows that
shadows a unique preorbit z ∈
K is a C 1-blender.

←−
K . Consequently we have (x, y) ∈ W u

More generally, given a ﬁnite set B, one can construct disjoint intervals ⊔b∈BIb ⊂ [−1, 1] and

an expanding map q : ⊔b∈B Ib → [−1, 1] so that q(Ib) is equal to [−1, 1].

Then given an IFS (fb)b∈B by contracting diﬀeomorphisms of R, we can deﬁne a map:

f : (x, y) ∈ ⊔b∈BIb × Rn 7→ (q(x), fb(y)),

if x ∈ Ib .

7

whose maximal invariant set K is hyperbolic. The second coordinate projection of K is the limit set
Λ of the IFS. Also if the IFS satisﬁes the covering property, then K is a blender (see also [BKR]).

Despite its fundamental aspect, our speciﬁc interest for Question 6 is to know whereas a covering-

like property is equivalent to the above deﬁnition of blender.

5 Parablenders

In this section we deal with C r-families of C r-endomorphisms of a compact manifold M , with k ≥ 1
parameters, that is elements in C r(Ik, C r(M, M )), denoted as (fa)a∈Ik .

Let f be a local diﬀeomorphism on M with a hyperbolic set K. Given (fa)a∈Ik C r-close to the
←−
K we can consider the family of local unstable manifolds
loc(x, f ))a∈Ik . Actually

loc(πfa(x), ǫ, fa))a∈Ik . It is easy to see that this family is C 0-close to (W u

constant family (f )a∈Ik , for each x ∈
(W u
it is much more:

K } is C r-close

We are now able to state:

Deﬁnition 19. A C r-parablender at a0 ∈ Ik for a family of endomorphisms (fa)a ∈ C r(Ik, C r(M, M ))
is a hyperbolic set K for fa0 such that:

– for every γ in a non-empty open subset U of C r(Ik, M ),

– and every (f ′

a)a in a neighborhood V of (fa)a in C r(Ik, C r(M, M )),

there exist x ∈

←−
K and ζ ∈ C r(Ik, M ) satisfying:

– ζ(a) belongs to W u

loc(πfa(x), fa) for every a ∈ Ik,

– the r-ﬁrst derivatives of γ and ζ are equal at a0:

ζ(a0) = γ(a0), Dζ(a0) = Dγ(a0),

. . . , Drζ(a0) = Drγ(a0) .

In particular K is a C r-blender.

The concept of parablender was introduced in [B] to prove that the diﬀeomorphisms with ﬁnitely
many attractors are not typical in the sens of Kolmogorov, a result in the opposite direction to a
conjecture of Pugh-Shub [PS] and to the main conjecture of Palis [P]. The parablenders deﬁned
therein are based on IFS of R generated by 2dim {P ∈R[X1,...,Xk]: deg(P )≤r} elements.

We give here a new example in the case k = 1 and n = 2, based on the above IFS theory. Note

that the number of elements is reduced to 2 and is now independent from the smoothness r.

Theorem B. For any surface M and any r ≥ 1, there exists a family (Fa)a ∈ C r(I, C r(M, M ))
which admits a C r-parablender induced by an IFS with 2 elements.

8

Proof. The construction is realized inside a disc and can be extended to any surface M . It uses
the previous examples: for λ ∈ (1/2, 1), we consider a C r-family (Fa)a∈I of C r-maps of R2 whose
restrictions to ([−2, −1] ∪ [1, 2]) × [−1/(1 − λ), 1/(1 − λ)] is:

Fa : (x, y) 7→ (4|x| − 6, (λ + a)y + sgn(x)).

The set of orbits (xn, yn)n∈Z of F0 that are contained in ([−2, −1] ∪ [1, 2]) × [−1/(1 − λ), 1/(1 − λ)]
project through the map (xn, yn)n 7→ (x0, y0) on a hyperbolic set K.

Denoting f±1,a : y 7→ (λ + a)y ± 1 the maps introduced in section 3, and g±1 : x 7→ ±4x − 6, we

get:

Fa : (x, y) 7→ (gsgn(x)(x), fsgn(x),a(y).

The families (f±1,a)a∈I induce an IFS on the jet space J r

Theorem A states that (for λ < 1 close enough to 1) there exists a non-empty open set A ⊂ J r

0 (I, R) generated by two maps (bf±1).
such that bf+1(A) ∪ bf−1(A) contains the closure of A. Let δ > 0 be the Lebesgue number of this
covering: every point in Closure(A) is the center of a δ- ball contained in bf+1(A) or in bf−1(A).
respectively bf+1(A) and bf−1(A). Note that A+ and A− are open sets and:

Let A+ and A− be the subsets of A formed by points whose δ-neighborhoods are contained in

A = A+ ∪ A− and Closure(bf −1

Let ζ(a) be the vertical projection of γ(a) into W u(δ; fa) for every a ∈ I. As (W u(δ; fa))a is
of class C r by Proposition 18, the function a 7→ ζ(a) is of class C r. We now consider the vertical
segment C(a) := [ζ(a), γ(a)]. Up to shrinking slightly V , we can assume that the stable cone ﬁeld

By Proposition 18, the r ﬁrst derivatives of (W u

the length of C(a) is at most (λ + η)|i|[APr

We recall that DF ′

a|C is (λ + η)-contracting. As Ci(a) has its tangent space in C it comes that
j=0 |a|j + |a|rρi(a)] for every i ≤ 0 and a small enough
in function of i. This proves that the length of C(a) and its r ﬁrst derivative w.r.t. a at a = 0 are
smaller than (λ + η)|i|, for every i ≤ 0. Hence they vanish all and so the r-ﬁrst derivatives of ζ and
γ are equal at a = 0.
