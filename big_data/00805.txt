We have recently developed an approach to calculate the equilibrium phase diagram of particle-
based microphase formers by numerical simulations (Zhuang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 098301
(2016)). Here, this approach is used to calculate the phase behavior of the square-well-linear model,
and compare the results with various theoretical predictions.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In simple liquids, gas-liquid coexistence results from
particles attracting one another. When a suﬃciently
strong and long-range repulsion frustrates this attraction,
however, microphases supersede the condensed phase.
Interestingly, the formation of these mesoscale struc-
tures is nearly as robust as the bulk behavior it re-
places. Microphases are indeed observed in systems as
diverse as magnetic alloys[1], Langmuir ﬁlms[2], and pro-
tein solutions[3], irrespective of the physical origin of the
competing short-range attractive and long-range repul-
sive (SALR) interaction[1, 4].

copolymers[5–7]–wherein chain connectivity creates long-
range frustration–can form a rich array of periodic mor-
phologies, such as clusters, lamellae, and gyroid[8, 9],
as well as exotic structures, such as zig-zag[10] and
O70[11] phases. The experimental controllability and re-
producibility of some of these structures further enable
their industrial uses for drug delivery[12, 13] nanoscale
patterning[14, 15], and lithography[16, 17], among oth-
ers.

theory[1, 18], density-functional theory (DFT)[5, 8, 9],
self-consistent ﬁeld theory (SCFT)[19], random-phase
approximation (RPA)[20, 21] and others[22, 23], have
been collated to describe various aspects of the ther-
modynamics and structure of microphases. Some of the
more microscopic features of microphase formers, how-
ever, remain harder to pinpoint.
In particular, the re-
lationship between the ordered microphase regime and
the disordered phase that surrounds it has been chal-
lenging to capture. A cluster ﬂuid and a percolating
(gel-like) ﬂuid have been argued to either surround or
substitute for the microphase regime; whether the phys-
ical origin of these disordered features is a question of
equilibrium[23, 24] or out-of-equilibrium dynamics[25–
29], or more akin to defect annealing [30–32] can be
diﬃcult to tease out.
In addition to being an inter-
esting physical question in its own right, it also mud-

dles the interpretation of certain experiments. Suspen-
sions of colloidal particles with SALR interactions, for
instance, have not yet been able to assemble periodic
microphases[3, 33–37]. In order to obtain a clearer un-
derstanding of microphase assembly the relationship be-
tween equilibrium statics and dynamics is needed.

In this context, dynamical and thermodynamical in-
sights from simulations would be beneﬁcial. The nu-
merical route, however, faces steep obstacles for study-
ing microphases. The two mains approaches for delin-
eating phase boundaries are challenged. First, if one
is willing to tolerate inaccuracy and hysteresis due to
the interfacial free energy, slow annealing from high tem-
peratures can sometimes suﬃce to sketch the phase di-
agram. The sluggish dynamics of the disordered phase
in the vicinity of the microphase regime, however, limits
the usefulness of this approach for identifying the mi-
crophase regime. Second, even hysteresis-free and high-
accuracy approaches developed for studying the equilib-
rium phase behavior, such as Widom insertion, Gibbs en-
semble Monte Carlo, and Frenkel-Ladd thermodynamic
integration[38], here encounter a serious diﬃculty. The
periodicity and occupancy of the mesoscale features can
be kept in a metastable state relatively far from equilib-
rium for arbitrarily long simulations times[39]. Finite-
size eﬀects for are thus much more pronounced than for
standard liquid models.

We have recently developed an approach to minimize
these ﬁnite-size eﬀects and identify the equilibrium phase
behavior of microphase formers[40]. This scheme extends
that developed for studying similar eﬀect in crystals with
vacancies[41], cluster crystals[42], and lattice models[39].
Here, we use this method to systematically study a model
microphase former and compare the results with vari-
ous analytical approximations. The plan for the rest of
this paper is as follows. We ﬁrst present a schematic
microphase-forming model with a SALR interaction, and
then detail the set of numerical tools necessary to exam-
ine its phase behavior. A series of theoretical approaches
are also used to approximate the phase behavior of this
model. Finally, we discuss the diﬀerence between simu-
lation and theory, and brieﬂy conclude.

Before diving into the core of the material, however,
let us make a terminological note. While gas-liquid coex-
istence terminates at a second-order critical point, Bra-
zovskii predicted the microphase regime to terminate at
a weakly ﬁrst-order order-disorder transition (ODT) for

systems with isotropic repulsion[18]. This behavior con-
trasts with that observed in systems with anisotropic re-
pulsion, for which the ODT is also critical[43]. The tran-
sition from gas-liquid critical point to ODT in anisotropic
systems is then itself a high-order critical point, a so-
called Lifshitz point[18, 43]. Some authors have chosen
to mildly abuse the term by using it to also describe the
comparable (but non-critical) transition in systems with
isotropic repulsion[44]. For notational convenience, we
here follow this analogy.

II. MODEL

The square-well-linear (SWL) model has a radially
symmetric pair interaction potential, and thus the to-
tal potential energy for a given conﬁguration rN with N
particles can be written as

U (rN ) =Xi<j

u(rij ),

(1)

where the SALR pair interaction potential can itself be
subdivided in two

u(r) = uHS(r) + uSALR(r).

(2)

The ﬁrst term contains the hard sphere (HS) volume ex-
clusion

uHS(r) =(∞ if r ≤ σ

if r > σ

0

(3)

for spheres of diameter σ, where σ sets the unit length.
The second term contains the SALR contribution,

uSALR(r) =


−ε
ξε(κ − r/σ)
0

if r < λσ
if λσ < r < κσ
if r > κσ

(4)

comprised of a square-well attraction of strength ε > 0,
where ε sets the unit of energy, followed beyond λσ by a
repulsive ramp of initial amplitude ξε that decays linearly
with r. In order to remain in a regime where, at small ξ,
the gas-liquid critical point remains stable with respect
to the solubility line of the crystal, we choose λ = 1.5[45].
Working in the simple ﬂuid regime and its perturbation
also has the advantage of easing the reversibility of inter-
particle bonds. Here, we consider the behavior of systems
with κ=2, 4, and 6 for ξ both below (simple liquid) and
above (microphase former) the Lifshitz point ξL.

III. SIMULATION METHODS

In this section we describe the Monte Carlo (MC) sim-
ulation methods used to extract the phase behavior of
the SWL model. Note that in general, we run 5 − 7

2

replicates for 106 MC steps at each state point studied.
In order to ensure suﬃcient sampling, diﬀerent sets of
MC moves are used for diﬀerent regimes. Speciﬁcs are
provided along with the method descriptions below, but
all regimes share a core MC sampling scheme that we
describe here. Single-particle local moves are performed
using Metropolis MC with a maximal local displacement
tuned, such that the acceptance ratio is kept between
40%–60%. Two types of non-local MC moves are also
systematically used: (i) 10% of the moves are system-
wide random displacements, and (ii) 10% are aggregation
volume biased (AVB) moves, which speciﬁcally displace
a particle to the surface of another[46]. The AVB “in”
region is set to the attraction radius, i.e., 1 < r < λ, and
the “out” region is the rest of the system.

A. Expanded Thermodynamics

The microphase-forming regime is the most challenging
one for which to obtain equilibrium conﬁgurations and
free energy information. The occupancy of the mesoscale
features that form a periodic lattice do not have a ﬁxed
occupancy. For a temperature-density state point, one
can thus obtain small features that are close to one an-
other, or bigger features that are further apart. Although
the thermodynamic ground state has a well-deﬁned av-
erage feature size and spacing, the ﬁnite-size nature of
simulations can result in metastable states having arbi-
trarily long lifetimes[47].

An expanded thermodynamics has been developed
n order surmount comparable diﬃculties in crystals
with vacancies[41] and in multiple-occupancy (cluster)
crystals[42, 47].
In addition to entropy S-temperature
T , pressure P -volume V , chemical potential µ-number
of particles N , we include a pair of conjugate variables:
the lattice occupancy nc and a chemical potential-like µc.
The diﬀerential form of the Helmholtz free energy is then

dFc = −SdT − P dV + µdN + µcdnc,

(1)

and at equilibrium, F (N, V, T ) = Fc(N, V, T, neq
c ). Be-
cause µ and µc are independent of the equilibrium quan-
tities and are only function of nc, equilibrium is reached
when

(cid:18) ∂Fc
∂nc(cid:19)N,V,T ;nc=neq

c

= 0.

(2)

The computational strategy consists of obtaining the free
energy of various morphologies for neq
c , and then use
those results along with the free energy results for the dis-
ordered phase to delimit the phase diagram of the model
by common tangent construction.

Because it is not a genuine physical quantity, the most
convenient deﬁnition of nc for a given system can be cho-
sen. Hence, its precise deﬁnition diﬀers for each mor-
phology (Table I). For instance, for the lamellar phase,
we choose the area number density per lamella, ̺L, while

for cluster crystals phases, we choose the average number

B. Two-Step Thermodynamic Integration

In order to obtain the free energy of a given periodic
microphase, we devise a two-step thermodynamic inte-
gration (TI) scheme, as schematized in Fig. 1. This ap-
proach extends that developed for studying a lattice mi-
crophase former[48] to an oﬀ-lattice model with a richer
set of microphase morphologies. The key requirement
for this scheme is to devise an integration path that con-
nects a system whose free energy is known to the system
of interest, while avoiding any ﬁrst-order phase transi-
tion. The hysteresis of such transition would indeed sig-
niﬁcantly reduce the accuracy of the method.

We choose as reference state the low-density limit of
hard spheres under an external modulated ﬁeld, F (r),
whose symmetry is akin to that of microphase morphol-
ogy of interest. When possible, we use combinations of
trigonometric functions with a wavevector k = 2π/ℓ that
controls the distance ℓ between periods of the ﬁeld. For
example, for the lamellar phase, which is periodic in one
dimension, we use a simple sinusoidal function

F (r) = F0 cos(kz)

(3)

with k depending on the lattice occupancy, here ̺ℓρℓ with
the average number density ρ ≡ N/V . The ﬁeld am-
plitude, F0, balances two considerations: (i) being suf-
ﬁciently strong for the morphology not to melt as the
ﬁeld is turned oﬀ (see below), and (ii) being suﬃciently
weak for sampling to remain eﬀective even in the highest-
energy parts of the ﬁeld. In practice, F0 = 2–5 is found to
be a good compromise. Note that a sinusoidal functional
form cannot be used for the double gyroid morphology,
which is a bicontinuous phase that emerges from a mini-
mal surface problem. The ﬁeld that couples to the parti-
cle distribution is instead chosen to be a minimal surface
function (see Table I).

The reference free energy for HS in a ﬁeld is then

f0,F (β, ρ) = f id(ρ) +ZV

e−βF (r)dr,

(4)

where βf id(ρ) = ln(ρΛ3) is the free energy of an ideal gas
of number density ρ, and the thermal de Broglie wave
length, Λ, is set to unity without loss of generality. For
some ﬁeld symmetry, this expression can be further sim-
pliﬁed, but in all cases parts of the integration must be
completed numerically.

The ﬁrst TI step brings the system density up to the

target ρ under a ﬁxed ﬁeld, which gives

fF (β, ρ) = f0,F (β, ρ) +Z ρ

Note that for the lamellar and cylindrical phases, a vir-

(6)

with stiﬀness kz applied to the box directions parallel to
the mesoscale features. This spring ensures that the ﬁnal
conﬁguration preserves the targeted lattice occupancy,
but its presence does not otherwise aﬀect the TI integra-
tion step.

In order to facilitate the numerical evaluation of the
ﬁrst TI step at low densities, we also compute the ﬁrst

and ZF (β) = Rr dreβF (r) is the normalization constant.

These expression can be further simpliﬁed for speciﬁc
ﬁeld symmetries, but part of the integration must be
completed numerically.

Note that because the ﬁrst TI step is performed at con-
stant pressure, we include logarithmic volume moves for
a fraction 1/N of total MC moves[38]. The speciﬁc sym-
metry of these moves depends on the microphase mor-
phology that is simulated:
for lamellae, the directions
perpendicular to the lamellae ﬂuctuate together, inde-
pendently of the third; for cylinders, the ratio between
the directions parallel to the cylinder is kept ﬁxed, in or-
der to preserve the structure; and for the other phases,
the cubic symmetry of the box is maintained. For the
FCC-cluster crystal phase, sampling is also accelerated
by using a cluster volume move algorithm speciﬁcally
designed for this phase. The move consists of (i) the
changing the volume of the equilibrium lattice sites and
(ii) changing the cluster and this lattice site. Details can
be found in Ref. 40.

which is the free energy for a system constrained to

The equilibrium free energy for the system, f (β, ρ), is
then obtained by minimizing the results for diﬀerent oc-
cupancy with respect to nc.

C. Cluster liquid regime

Upon increasing the ﬂuid density from the ideal gas
limit, we ﬁnd that the system forms a ﬂuid of clusters
before periodic microphases become thermodynamically
stable. The process is akin to micelle formation, because
clusters emerge suddenly yet continuously, and is there-
fore not a phase transition. We can thus adapt the tools
developed to determine the critical micelle concentration
(cmc) to our system[40].

In the spirit of the classical deﬁnition of the cmc, which
situates the crossover as the point of most abrupt change
in the physico-chemical properties of the system[49], we
take the minimum – when it exists – of

h(ρ) ≡

βP − ρ

ρ2

,

(12)

which measures deviations of the equation of state from
the ideal gas behavior. The pronounced peak it exhibits
in cluster-forming systems indicates a rapid change in the
system properties. In practice, we determine the cmc by
ﬁrst ﬁtting the numerical results for the equation of state
to

βp = ρs + ρm + B2,ssρ2

In order to minimize the numerical integration error, a
Gauss–Lobatto quadrature with 20 points is used.

Summing the various free energy contributions along

the integration path gives

where ρs and ρm are the monomer and cluster number
densities, respectively. A cluster is deﬁned as containing
at least two particles ij with rij < λ. The second virial
coeﬃcients B2,mm and B2,sm are ﬁtted to the simulation
results, while

results to Eq. (15) for κ = 2 and ξ = 6.0 (empty circles), κ = 4

(empty triangles).

FIG. 3. Average potential energy hUi of the disordered phase
at κ = 4, ξ = 0.05 and T = 0.6 (blue), T = 0.8 (red) and
T = 1.0 (green). Black markers denote the percolation tran-
sition. Note that the evolution of the energy is continuous
and smooth over the entire ﬂuid regime.

In the cluster ﬂuid regime, a fraction 1/N of the MC
moves are virtual moves, which enable eﬃcient cluster
displacements[50]. As these moves have a signiﬁcant
computational overhead, however, they are only used in
the non-percolated cluster ﬂuid regime, where the in-
crease sampling eﬃciency warrants the cost.

D. Cluster percolation transition

Upon further increasing the ﬂuid density, the roughly
spherical clusters ﬁrst turn into wormlike clusters and
then into a disordered percolating network. Here again,
although this change does not correspond to a thermo-
dynamic transition,
it nonetheless marks a signiﬁcant
change in the MC sampling eﬃciency. At low temper-
atures, cluster ﬂuid conﬁgurations are best sampled by
virtual MC moves (as mentioned above), while the per-
colated ﬂuid–being harder to sample–requires the use of
parallel tempering (see below). It is thus algorithmically
useful to locate the onset of ﬂuid percolation.

We deﬁne a pair ij of particles to be in contact if they
are within their attraction range, i.e., if rij < λ. The per-
colation transition, ρp(T ), of the ﬂuid is then determined
by ﬁnite-size scaling of the mid-point of the percolation
probability for diﬀerent system sizes

∆ρ(N ) ≡ |ρ 1

2

(N ; T ) − ρp(T )| = N − 1
dν ,

(15)

where dν = 2.706 is the universal critical scaling for
three-dimensional standard percolation[51]. The inter-
cept gives the thermodynamic, N → ∞, percolation on-
set (Fig. 2).

Sampling is achieved using 2 × 105 MC steps of ele-
mentary AVB moves and random local displacements for

N = 200 to 1600. The percolation probability is ob-
tained over at least 20 conﬁgurations, and over all box
directions, in order to minimize ﬁnite-size eﬀects[51, 52].

E. Percolated ﬂuid regime

In order to get an eﬃcient sampling within the perco-
lated ﬂuid regime, we use a standard parallel-tempering
scheme with attempts at exchanging conﬁgurations oc-
curring a fraction 1/N of the MC moves. The tempera-
ture intervals and the number of conﬁgurations are cho-
sen so that regular replica exchange takes place. For
κ = 4, for instance, we ﬁnd ∆T = 0.0125 for T < 0.55
and ∆T = 0.0250 for T > 0.55 to robustly work for
systems of size N = 600 to 2400.
In order to sample
ergodically, for ρ < 0.25 the temperature chain goes up
to T = 0.70, while for ρ > 0.45 the chain goes up to
T = 1.00. In total, 20 to 100 system replicas are thus
simulated.

The resulting equilibrium conﬁgurations enable the
free energy to be obtained by standard TI over T and
ρ[38]. Note that no discontinuity is observed in either
the average potential energy hU i (Fig. 3) or the free en-
ergy (not shown), which suggests that a good sampling
is obtained, and is consistent with the absence of a phase
transition.

F. Gas-liquid coexistence and the Lifshitz point

As mentioned in the introduction, microphases form
when the long-range repulsion is suﬃciently strong, i.e.
when ξ is above the Lifshitz point, ξL(κ). For ξ < ξL(κ),
a standard gas-liquid coexistence is observed instead. In

order to set a lower bound on ξL(κ), we determine the
gas-liquid coexistence regime of small ξ systems using a
Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) scheme[38]. We
simulate systems with N = 512 for κ = 2 and κ = 4,
and with N = 1024 for κ = 6, and employ somehwat
standard GEMC moves[38]: local single-particle displace-
ments, volume exchanges for a fraction 1/N of the moves,
and particle exchanges for 10% of the moves.

Figure 4 shows the simulation results for κ = 2, 4 and
6. From the failure of the GEMC coexistence determi-
nation, we estimate ξL(2) = 4.5(5), ξL(4) = 0.025(5) and
ξL(6) = 0.0025(5). Note that the large ξ models we con-
sider below have ξ = 6.0 for κ = 2, ξ = 0.05 for κ = 4,
and ξ = 0.0318 for κ = 6, which are all well above ξL(κ).
For ξ > ξL, the second-order gas-liquid critical point is
replaced by a weakly ﬁrst-order, order-disorder transition
(ODT)[1, 5, 18]. This point is the highest temperature at
which periodic microphases melt. Because of the fairly
symmetric form of the SALR interaction chosen, the den-
sity where it takes place, ρODT, lies within the lamellar
phase[4]. We can thus detect TODT by monitoring the
decay of the lamellar order parameter

(18)

at ρODT, chosen so as to maximize the melting tempera-
ture of lamellae. Because nc does not change much with
T within this regime (see inset of Fig. 5), it is kept con-
stant over the course of these simulations. Measurements
are made with N = 8000 and start from ρ = 0.37 in the
equilibrium lamellar phase with ℓ = 5.23 at T = 0.5 for
κ = 4 and ℓ = 5.72 at T = 0.7 for κ = 6. The steady
heating of these conﬁgurations give the results in Fig-
ure 5.

dom phase approximation. We also use (ii) and a sim-
ple density-functional theory to obtain the critical point,
Tc(κ, ξ), for ξ ≤ ξL(κ), and (ii) alone for estimating the
microphase envelope ξ ≤ ξL(κ).

A. Low-temperature approximation

We ﬁrst estimate the Lifshitz point by using a low-
temperature approximation (LTA) for the long length
scale structure of the ground state. A compact ground
state is assumed to result from the system undergoing a
gas-liquid separation, and hence to have a critical point.
By contrast, a ground state with mesoscale features is
assumed to result from the system forming periodic mi-
crophases. The transition from a compact to a mesoscale
ground state should thus provide an estimate of ξL.

In order to obtain a numerical estimate of that struc-
ture, we follow the approach presented in Refs. 53 and 54,
and adapted to the case of particle microphase formers
by Ciach[4]. In this scheme, mesoscale ordering is consid-
ered to emerge when a ﬁnite wavevector, i.e., 0 < k < 2π

where g(r) is the radial distribution function. A min-
imum at k > 0 can be found if h ˜U i(0; g(r)) is itself a
maximum. The Lifshitz point that separates gas–liquid

This approximation is clearly very crude, but improv-
ing the description of g(r) is non-trivial. Although a
better estimate of the HS structure could be considered,
it would only slightly perturb the estimate because the
resulting high-k modiﬁcation would not carry over to the
low-k regime, which is here of interest. Obtaining a bet-
ter description of mesoscale ordering might improve the
estimate, but developing such a description is beyond

stead consider approaching microphase formation from
the simple liquid regime, where structural approxima-
tions are more forthcoming.

B. Random Phase Approximation

A divergence of the liquid structure factor, S(k), in-
dicates that the homogeneous ﬂuid phase becomes un-
stable to long length scale (small k) ﬂuctuations. For
a simple liquid, the gas-liquid spinodal can thus be ex-
tracted from the divergence of the liquid compressibility,
i.e., χ = S(0), using the compressibility sum rule[55]. A
divergence at a small but non-zero k indicates instead the
emergence of clustering, which hints at the formation of
microphases.

The random phase approximation (RPA) relates the
structure factor to the Fourier transform of the Ornstein-
Zernike direct correlation function c(r; ρ),

S(k) =

1 − ρˆc(k; ρ)

.

Following Ref. 21, here we treat the SALR contribution,
uSALR(r), as a perturbation of the Percus–Yevick approx-

8

imation for hard spheres. We thus obtain

ˆc(k; ρ) = ˆcPY(k; ρ) − β ˆuSALR(k),

From the two densities at which χ diverges, we identify
the spinodal regime. The temperature at which the two
branches meet at a single point gives (Tc, ρc).

For ξ > ξL(κ), the gas-liquid spinodal and the criti-
cal point are replaced by the microphase regime and the
order-disorder transition, respectively.
In this regime,
the divergence of the structure factor occurs at k > 0.
The onset of the k > 0 divergence of S(k) thus deter-
mines the Lifshitz point. Fixing κ, we locate the bound-
ary between TODT and Tc by examining the behavior of
S(0). An ODT occurs when S(0) is ﬁnite (and positive)
as S(k) diverges for 0 < k < 2π (Fig. 6). As an additional
check of this estimate we make sure that TODT > Tc for
ξ > ξL (see inset of Fig. 6). The results for the Lif-
shitz point are given in Figure 7, and more speciﬁcally
ξL(2) = 1.33, ξL(4) = 0.010, and ξL(6) = 0.0009. Using

a similar approach at diﬀerent temperatures to ﬁnd the
pair of densities at which S(0) is ﬁnite and positive while
S(k) diverges for 0 < k < 2π, we can obtain an estimate
of the envelope of the microphase regime.

Interestingly,

it has also been argued that for very
strong repulsion, the formation of periodic microphases
becomes impossible [57–59]. For ˆuSALR(k) = 0, clus-
ters are indeed hard-sphere-like, and for ˆuSALR(k) > 0,
cluster-cluster repulsion dominates. The growth of larger
mesoscale features is then expected to be fully suppressed
and the system to form a Wigner glass at low tempera-
tures. This condition thus sets an upper ξ limit for the
microphase regime (Fig. 7).

C. Simple density functional theory

The isothermal compressibility can also be obtained
from the liquid free energy, i.e., χ = ∂2f /∂v2. A density
functional theory (DFT) description of the SWL model
can thus also provide an estimate the liquid instability.

Assuming that the SWL liquid entropy is the same as
that of a HS liquid, and that the SALR contribution is
but a perturbation, the liquid free energy becomes

f DFT(β, ρ) =fid(ρ) + fex,HS(ρ)+

where the PY approximation for HS gives

and

ZZ drdr′vSALR(|r − r′|) =

[ξ(κ4 − 4κλ3 + 3λ4) + 4λ3].

(13)
The spinodal, however, only emerges for a speciﬁc range
of repulsion strength, i.e., for small ξ, where normal gas–
liquid phase separation takes place. We thus determine

Tc by identifying where the two branches that delimit
the onset of the unphysical regime, i.e., ∂f /∂v = 0, meet
(Fig. 4(d)).

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

RPA and DFT predictions for Tc are obtained at weak
ξ (Fig. 4). As expected, Tc monotonically decreases
with increasing ξ, and, after normalizing the results for
ξ = 0, the two approaches are essentially indistinguish-
able. This suggests a reasonably high degree of con-
sistence between both mean-ﬁeld-like approaches. The
relative simulation results also follow qualitatively the
same trend, but the estimates are quantitatively rela-
tively poor.

Both LTA and RPA yield predictions for ξL(κ) (Fig.
7). This time, little quantitative diﬀerence is observed
between the two approaches (only a few percent), de-
spite them being based on markedly diﬀerent physical
principles. The two approaches are also a factor of 2-
3 times smaller than the numerical estimates for the
Lifshitz point. This trend is consistent with the mean-
ﬁeld-like nature of the theoretical descriptions. In a sys-
tem with genuine three-dimensional ﬂuctuations, repul-
sion must indeed be strengthened in order to impose a
periodic microphase order.

By contrast, the intermediate-temperature cluster ﬂuid

FIG. 9. Summary T − ρ phase diagram for (a) κ = 4 and (b) κ = 6. The cmc (triangles) and the percolation (lozenges) lines

that is a precursor to the low-temperature Wigner glass
is expected to be fairly insensitive to ﬂuctuations, as it
lacks long-range order. Because the microphase regime–
squeezed between the simple ﬂuid and the Wigner glass
regime–shrinks with κ (Fig. 7), the depression of ξL(κ)
suﬃce for the ordered regime to disappear at small κ. For
instance, we not only observe that ξL(2) is essentially su-
perimposed with the RPA Wigner glass boundary, but
despite our best eﬀorts no stable periodic microphase
regime could be found for κ = 2 (Fig. 8). The phase
behavior of a system with ξ = 6 only displays a cmc-like
clustering transition and the clusters eventually percolate
upon increasing density. The low-temperature regime,
however, remains disordered over all the T -ρ range con-
sidered. This system isntead seems to gradually freeze
in a disordered density proﬁle. This phenomenon is akin
to a “dynamic cluster glass” [57, 58]. The quantitative
prediction for the Wigner glass regime from RPA thus
does seem physically relevant for this model.

For κ = 4 and κ = 6, phase diagrams with periodic
microphase regimes could be obtained numerically (at
ξ = 0.05 and ξ = 0.0318, respectively). Qualitatively,
these two phase diagrams are fairly similar and consistent
with the periodic microphase sequence – cluster crystal,
cylindrical, double gyroid and lamellar phases – of sys-
tems described by a comparable Landau functional[4].
Note, however, that an exhaustive search for microphase
morphologies was not attempted[40]. The main diﬀer-
ences for κ = 6 is the broader range of stability for the
double gyroid and that the more extended microphase
regime. The latter observation is consistent with the
RPA predictions (Fig. 9(c)). Indeed, although RPA over-
estimates the microphase envelope and TODT, it does so
consistently, predicting a broader and higher envelope
for κ = 6 than for κ = 4.
Interestingly, the discrep-
ancy between RPA and the simulation results seems to
shrink as the repulsion range increases (T RPA
ODT = 0.946(1)

v TODT = 0.535(5) for κ = 4 and T RPA
ODT = 1.243(1) v
TODT = 0.90(2) for κ = 6). A broader range of nu-
merical results would, however, be needed for stronger
conclusions to be drawn from this observation.

The interplay between the percolated and cluster ﬂuid
regimes, on the one hand, and the ordered microphase
regime, on the other, also appears to be fairly indepen-
dent of the model parameters. An equilibrium ﬂuid of
clusters and an equilibrium (gel-like) percolated ﬂuid sur-
round the ordered microphase regime, and should there-
fore be taken into account when considering the assembly
of the microphases.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have used a recently-developed TI-based sim-
ulation scheme for
solving the phase diagram of
a continuous-space model with a microphase-forming
regime. Predictions from RPA and other theoretical ap-
proximations are shown to be in reasonably good qualita-
tive agreement with the numerical results. Quantitative
discrepancies can mostly be ascribed to the mean-ﬁeld-
like nature of the theoretical treatments. In particular,
the methods predict a lower ξL than the simulation re-
sults, and increasing the repulsion range appears to im-
prove the agreement.

The advance provided by the development of a numer-
ical toolset for studying periodic microphases provides
complete coverage of the phenomenology exhibited by
SALR interaction potentials. It reveals the rich thermo-
dynamic interplay between order and disorder in these
systems. We thus expect this approach to enable the
complete elucidation of the dynamical behavior of these
systems.
