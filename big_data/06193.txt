Linear response theory relates the response of a system to the power-spectrum of its ﬂuctuations.
However, the response to external driving in realistic models exhibits a pronounced non-linear
blurring of the spectral line-shape. Considering a driven Bose-Hubbard trimer model we ﬁgure out
what is the hidden time scale that controls this smearing eﬀect. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
the Fermi-golden-rule picture fails miserably in predicting the non-linear width of the transitions.
Instead, if the system has a classical limit, the determination of the hidden time scale requires taking
into account the underlying classical phase-space dynamics.

The response of a system to a driving source f (t) is
a recurring major theme in mechanics. The resulting
diﬀusive spreading of the system’s energy distribution is
often treated within the well known framework of linear
response theory (LRT) with its celebrated ﬂuctuation-
dissipation relation. From a mesoscopic perspective, the
derivation of the Kubo formula for the diﬀusion in en-
ergy requires the assumption of chaotic ergodicity [1, 2].
In a quantum context, an attempt has been made to ex-
tract LRT from the Fermi-golden-rule (FGR) picture of
transitions between levels [3, 4]. However, this derivation
turned out to be non-trivial [5], and has motivated more
elaborate studies [6–8]. Considering a driven chaotic sys-
tem,

H = H0 + f (t)W

(1)

with a weak noisy perturbation f (t), it is claimed that
the transition rate from level m to level n is
wnm = |Wn,m|2 A2 2π ˜F (En−Em)

(2)

where A2 ˜F (ω) is the power spectrum of f (t), and A is
its RMS value. If the correlation time of the noisy per-
turbation is τnoise, then ˜F (ω) has 1/τnoise width. How-
ever,
for the very common case of harmonic driving
f (t) = A sin(Ωt) (such that A = A/√2), ˜F (ω) is a sum of
delta functions, namely (1/2)P δ(ω±Ω). The standard
phenomenology is to assume that any ﬁnite amplitude A
implies an intrinsic width 1/τ that depends on A. Thus
the delta functions are broadened,

δ(ω − Ω)

7→ τ G(cid:18) ω − Ω
1/τ (cid:19)

(3)

where G(x) is a normalized Gaussian-like function (the
exact form of G(x) is practically insigniﬁcant). We argue
below that an appropriate prescription is in fact

The intrinsic time scale τ does not manifest itself in the
traditional LRT analysis: it cancels out in any formal cal-
culation of energy spreading under the standard assump-
tion that the width 1/τ is much larger than the level spac-
ing, but much narrower than any other spectral feature.
In idealized circumstances one assumes (a) an homoge-
neous density of levels g(E), and (b) a ﬂat band. The lat-
ter requirement means that the squared matrix elements
|Wnm|2 are statistically independent of En and Em in
the energy range of interest. Such idealization underlies
the Random Matrix Theory (RMT) approach of Wigner
and followers. The outcomes of LRT is the Kubo ex-
pression for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, which can be writ-
ten schematically as DE = c(Ω)A2. Within this frame-
work, the FGR-based quantum version of the Kubo for-
mula gives the same result as the classical version, up
to “weak” corrections [9]. This is somewhat analogous
to the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn f -sum-rule, and has been
termed restricted quantum-classical correspondence (re-
stricted QCC).

The ﬂat-band assumption is generally not satisﬁed in
mesoscopic systems of physical interest. Thus, in general
we expect the hidden time scale τ (A) to manifest itself in
any realistic energy spreading process. It is therefore im-
plied that the Kubo expression for the diﬀusion in energy
acquires a non-linear dependence, namely,

DE = c(Ω; τ (A)) A2

(5)

In the present work we oﬀer predictions for the func-
tions c(Ω, τ ) and τ (A), and test them on a concrete
and experimentally-realizable model system. Further-
more, we would like to determine whether the evalua-
tion of τ (A) requires quantum mechanics, or maybe QCC
holds with regard to this hidden time scale too.

canonical destruction and creation operators in second

quantization, K is the hopping frequency, and U is the
on-site interaction. This system is the minimal Bose-
Hubbard model admitting chaos. The dynamics of the
undriven system at any given energy E is determined
by a single dimensionless parameter u = U N/K. The
classical limit is attained as N → ∞ while u is kept
constant. At this limit quantum ﬂuctuations diminish
and the ﬁeld operators ai may be replaced by c-numbers.
We identify the chaotic regions in the {E, u} parameter
space from the quantum level spacing statistics, using ei-
ther the Brody-parameter map [18] or the adjacent level
spacing correlation function [19], as detailed in references
[20, 21]. Further veriﬁcation of chaoticity is obtained
from the classical Poincare sections at the same parame-
ter values. Below we take u = 3 and initiate the system
in the middle of the energy spectrum, i.e. ε(t = 0) = 1/2
where ε ≡ E/(Emax − Emin) and Emin,max denote the
extremal energies of the spectrum at the pertinent value
of u. This choice ensures the chaotic dynamics of the
undriven trimer system.

The trimer of Eq. (6) is subjected to weak har-
monic driving via its hopping term, as in [20], namely,
(K/2) 7→ (K/2) + A sin Ωt, and hence the perturbation
term in Eq.(1) is W = P2

Band proﬁle.– The classical power spectrum of the
perturbation W in the absence of driving can be obtained
by calculating the Fourier transform of hW (t)W (0)i for
a long ergodic trajectory. It corresponds to the quantum
spectral function

with an implicit averaging over the reference state m
within the energy window of interest. A rough but peda-
gogical way to write this formula is ˜C(ω) = 2πg(E)|W|2
where g(E) is the density of states.
It shows that the
power-spectrum reﬂects the band-proﬁle of the pertur-
bation matrix.

Common random matrix models assume that the band
proﬁle is ﬂat, in the sense that a band |ω| < ∆b can be
deﬁned, within which all matrix elements are compa-
rable in size. The bandwidth for strongly chaotic sys-
tems is related to the classical correlation time, namely
∆b = 2π/τcl. However, the classical power spectrum of
the Bose-Hubbard trimer (top panel of Fig. 1) is by no
means ﬂat, because the model system is not strongly
chaotic. Thus, the correlation time and the bandwidth
are quantitatively ill-deﬁned. This is in fact the typical
situation for any realistic non-artiﬁcial model of physical
interest.

Transition rates for low drive frequencies.– The
FGR implies that the transition rate from an initial
level Em to another level En is w = 2π|W|2A2τ , where
A2τ and |W|2 are the intensity of the driving source and
the associated coupling strength for the pertinent tran-

sition frequency. While this estimate is valid in the high
frequency range Ω ≫ 1/τ , we argue below that for the
purpose of energy-spreading analysis this rule should be
extended as:

w = 2π|W|2 ×(cid:26)(AΩ)2τ 3 for Ωτ ≪ 1
for Ωτ ≫ 1

Interpolation between the low-frequency (”DC”) and
high-frequency (”AC”) regimes, then leads to the ex-
pression in the square brackets of Eq. (4). Note that
the normalization of A2 ˜F (ω) in the AC regime reﬂects
the variance of the amplitude Var[f ] = A2, while in the
DC regime it reﬂects the variance of the sweep rate
Var[ ˙f ] = (AΩ)2.
to understand the DC extension of
Eq. (8), consider ﬁrst a ﬂat-band within the energy
range |En − Em − Ω| . (1/τ ).
This band contains
N ≈ (1/τ )g(E) levels. The standard AC expression im-
plies that the total FGR rate

In order

Γ = N w = 2πA2|W|2g(E)

(9)

is independent of Ω. This is clearly false in the DC
regime, because the rate of transitions should vanish in
the adiabatic limit. The proper procedure in the DC
regime, is to switch from the ﬁxed-basis to the adiabatic-
basis representation (for details see [6–8]).
Conse-
quently A and W are transformed as A 7→ (AΩ) and

W 7→ (W/ω). Thus, with ω ∼ (1/τ ) the AC formula
is replaced by the DC version of Eq. (8).
It is implied
that ˜Γ = (Ωτ )2Γ ∝ (AΩ)2 is the eﬀective “level broaden-
ing”. This DC broadening depends on the sweep rate
| ˙f| ∼ (AΩ), in contrast to the AC broadening that de-
pends predominantly on A.
The diﬀusion coeﬃcient.– The diﬀusion coeﬃcient
characterizes the second-moment of the spreading pro-
cess, namely, (δE)2 = 2DEt.
In the AC regime it is
estimated as DE ∼ ΓΩ2, while in the DC regime it is es-
timated as DE ∼ ˜Γ(1/τ )2. Therefore, under a ﬂat-band
assumption we get formally the same expression in both
regimes, and the τ dependence cancels out.

When ˜C(ω) is not ﬂat, a more careful calculation is re-
quired, accounting for the ω dependence of the rates wnm
in Eq.(2). Summing over all the possible transitions we
obtain Eq.(5) with

c(Ω, τ ) = Z ∞

0

ω2 ˜C(ω) ˜F (ω)dω

(10)

This formula is often used to evaluate the decay rates of
systems subjected to noisy perturbations, as in the Zeno
and anti-Zeno eﬀects [22]. It implies τ -sensitivity in re-
alistic models where the ﬂat-band assumption is inappli-
cable. Hence we anticipate the existence of the hidden
time scale τ to be exposed.

Long-time energy spreading.– Given the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient DE the long time evolution of the system’s
energy distribution can be deduced. LRT is based on
the observation that upon coarse-graining the coherent
transitions become stochastic-like [4–9], hence the time
evolution of the probabilities pn(t) = |hn|ψ(t)i|2 obeys a
master equation:

pn = Xm

wnm (pm − pn) ,

(11)

where the transition rates are given by Eq. (2). From
here one deduces the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) for
the diﬀusion in energy space [20, 23–29]:

Prediction for the hidden time scale.– In order
to calculate DE using Eq.(10) with Eq.(4) we have to
know how τ depends on A and Ω. We ﬁrst attempt to
propose a self-consistent prediction:

naive guess (1/τ ) = Γ ∝ A2. However in view of Eq.(4)
the self-consistent equation takes the form

The solution of this equation in the adiabatic regime
leads to the second entry in Eq.(13), that features a slower
dependence on A, namely, (1/τ ) ∝ A2/3.
At this stage one wonders what is the condition for
the validity of the self-consistent FGR approach. This

FIG. 4: (color online) Comparison of the instantaneous vari-
ance at Kt = 50 for quantum (circles) and classical (solid line)
simulations with the same quantity obtained from the FGR
rate equation Eq. (11) (dashed line) and the FPE equation

has been discussed in [6–8]. The key observation is that
the small parameter of the theory is (1/τ )/∆b [a]. How-
ever, this condition is very diﬃcult to satisfy for struc-
tured ˜C(ω) band-proﬁles (as in Fig. 1) because stretches
of ﬂat-band are very small, especially in the vicinity of
sharp peaks. The FGR picture should therefore be sup-
plemented with an additional parameter τ that cannot
be determined self-consistently from FGR considerations
alone.

If the FGR validity condition (1/τ ) ≪ ∆b

is vio-
lated, then τ ≪ τcl. This requirement of having non-
perturbative mixing of levels prior to τcl is in-fact a neces-
sary condition for detailed semi-classical correspondence.
If detailed QCC holds, one should expect a leading lin-
ear dependence (1/τ ) ∝ A, which is the third entry in
Eq.(13). The reasoning is as follows: for sake of argumen-
tation assume that ˜C(ω) possesses a peak at some fre-
quency ωr that corresponds to some classical resonance.
If the driving amplitude is A, then the adiabatic energy
surface H = E will have a variation ∝ A in phase space,
leading to a smearing of the resonance position over an
associated frequency scale ∝ A. Similar eﬀect can be
caused by blurring of regions in mixed phase-space.
Manifestation of the hidden time scale.– We
turn to present a numerical procedure for detecting the
hidden time scale. Our testing ground is the Bose-
Hubbard model of Eq.(6). Subjecting the trimer to driv-
ing as described above, we carry out both classical and
quantum propagation and follow the time evolution of
the expanding energy distribution pn(t), calculating its
variance (δE)2 at each instant of time. In Fig. 1b we plot

4

the instantaneous variance as a function of the drive fre-
quency Ω after a predetermined evolution time. LRT pre-
dicts that the same dependence of δE2/A2 on the drive
frequency Ω would be obtained for all drive intensities,
i.e. δE2/A2 ∼ Ω2 ˜C(ω = Ω) (solid black line). While
at low drive intensities this is indeed roughly the case,
higher intensities result in broadening of the response
proﬁle. We benchmark the theoretical predictions of the
previous sections by assessing whether this non-linear re-
sponse eﬀect can be reproduced by introducing the hid-
den time scale τ into the analysis.

As demonstrated in Fig. 2, the time dependence of
(δE)2/A2 on A can be indeed reproduced by ﬁtting the
single parameter τ in the FGR simulation of Eq. (11).
The best-ﬁt 1/τ values for various values of Ω (Fig. 3b)
are much smaller than the naive FGR-based expectation
(1/τ ) ≈ Γ ∝ A2 (Fig. 3a), indicating the complete fail-
ure of the standard LRT. This is a-priori expected from
the former discussion of Eq.(13), because the condition
Γ < ∆b is largely violated.

The A dependence of the frequency averaged 1/τ is
presented in Fig. 3c. We observe that this eﬀective width
depends linearly on A, indicating that the semi-classical
perspective (third entry in the r.h.s. of Eq.(13)) is most
appropriate for its determination. For comparison, the
naive quadratic LRT prediction (dashed line) is nowhere
near the numerical results.

Having obtained in Fig.3c the A dependence of the sin-
gle parameter τ (A), we check whether it can be used in
order to reproduce the full Ω dependence of the spreading
variance. Using either the FGR rate equation, Eq.(11), or
its coarse-grained FPE version Eq.(12), we show in Fig. 4
that the details of the line broadening are accurately re-
produced. The dependence of 1/τ on Ω can therefore be
neglected in practice. Still, there is a weak modulation in
the middle panel of Fig. 3 that exhibits anti-correlation
with the Γ of the top panel. We attribute this modula-
tion to a residual FGR eﬀect implied by the discussion
of Eq.(13): wherever the FGR condition is not violated,
it predicts a larger 1/τ compared with the linear semi-
classical estimate.

Conclusions.– The analysis and numerical results of
this work demonstrate that the nonlinear smearing of the
LRT response line-shape can be explained by introducing
an eﬀective A-dependent width 1/τ in the expression for
the FGR transition rates. The determination of the hid-
den time scale τ requires to go beyond the conventional
FGR picture.
