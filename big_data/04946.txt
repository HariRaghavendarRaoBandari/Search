Abstract. The nuclear mean-ﬁeld potential arising from the 12C+12C interaction at the low
energies relevant for the astrophysical carbon burning process has been constructed within the
double-folding model, using the realistic nuclear ground-state density of the 12C nucleus and the
eﬀective M3Y nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction constructed from the G-matrix of the Paris (free)
NN potential. To explore the nuclear medium eﬀect, both the original density independent M3Y-
Paris interaction and its density dependent CDM3Y6 version have been used in the folding model
calculation of the 12C+12C potential. The folded potentials at the diﬀerent energies were used in
the optical model description of the elastic 12C+12C scattering at the energies around and below the
Coulomb barrier, as well as in the barrier penetration model to estimate the fusion cross section
and astrophysical S factor of the 12C+12C reactions at the low energies. The obtained results are
in good agreement with experimental data over a wide range of energies.

Key words. Nuclear mean-ﬁeld, 12C+12C fusion, astrophysical S factor.

I. INTRODUCTION

The 12C+12C fusion plays an important role in the whole chain of nucleosynthesis
processes during stellar evolution, as the main nuclear reaction governing the carbon
burning process in the young massive stars that generates the heavier elements or the
pycnonuclear reaction that leads a carbon-oxygen white dwarf to the type Ia supernova
explosion [1, 2, 3]. A general scenario for a massive star of about ten times the solar mass
implies that after the helium burning process its core consists predominantly of the 12C and
16O ashes. As soon as this core begins to collapse gravitationally igniting the 12C and 16O
ashes into the 12C+12C, 12C+16O, and 16O+16O fusion reactions, the ﬁrst reaction is more
favorable because it has the lowest Coulomb barrier. It also generates the heavier nuclei
like 23Na, 20Ne, and 23Mg for the next burning stage of the stellar evolution. In fact, at
the typical temperatures and densities in the outer-shell region of T ≈ 109 K and ρ ≈ 105
g/cm3 respectively, the 12C+12C fusion forms the 24Mg compound nucleus with mass
diﬀerence between the 12C+12C system and 24Mg nucleus of about 14 MeV. Therefore,
the compound 24Mg∗ nucleus is highly excited and has a large number of overlapping
states with the partial widths of the light particle emissions (neutron, proton and α)
dominating the γ-ray emission width. The main decay products of the compound 24Mg∗
nucleus are 23Na, 20Ne, and 23Mg in the 12C(12C,p)23Na (Q = 2241 keV), 12C(12C,α)20Ne
(Q = 4617 keV), and 12C(12C,n)23Mg (Q = - 2599 keV) reaction channels, respectively,

while the remaining processes such as 12C(12C,γ)24Mg, 12C(12C,8Be)16O are less important
at astrophysical energies [3]. In these channels, the 12C(12C,p)23Na and 12C(12C,α)20Ne
reactions dominate the total 12C+12C fusion cross section with about equal probabilities
for proton and α emissions.

In astrophysical conditions, the eﬀective thermal energy of 12C is approximately 2
MeV [1] while the Coulomb barrier of the 12C+12C system is around 8 MeV which sub-
stantially lowers the probability of 12C+12C fusion in such conditions. A narrow window
for 12C+12C fusion becomes possible thanks to the quantum tunneling eﬀect that allows
the two 12C nuclei to penetrate the Coulomb barrier without the need of having suﬃcient
energy to overcome it [4]. The 12C+12C fusion caused by the tunnel eﬀect has been rea-
sonably described by the barrier penetration model (BPM) [5, 6, 7], which is used by many
authors to estimate nuclear reaction rates in stars. Typically, the nuclear reaction rate, a
vital input for the study of stellar evolution, is expressed in terms of the astrophysical S
factor [8]

S = Ec.m. σR exp(2πη),

(1)

here Ec.m. is the center-of-mass (c.m.) kinetic energy (in MeV) in the entrance channel, σR
is the total reaction cross section (in barn) and η is the Sommerfeld parameter determined
as

2πη = 2π

ν

pEc.m.(MeV)

where ν is the relative velocity of the colliding nuclei. The astrophysical S factor is
an important quantity introduced to describe the rate of a speciﬁc reaction in nuclear
astrophysics studies [9]. At very low energies, typical for nuclear astrophysics processes,
the cross sections (or the astrophysical S factors) of the charged-induced reactions are
extremely diﬃcult to measure in the laboratory because of the the repulsive Coulomb
barrier that reduces the S factor substantially. Therefore, it is important to have a reliable
theoretical model to evaluate the astrophysical S factors of diﬀerent nuclear reactions in
the stellar energy region.

Because the 12C+12C fusion reaction is an important part of the star evolution and
still not fully understood, it has motivated many studies during the last four decades
[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. The cross section of the 12C+12C fusion reaction was
calculated by diﬀerent authors within the BPM framework using the diﬀerent models of
the 12C+12C potential [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. However, the physics origin of the rapidly ﬂuc-
tuating 12C+12C fusion cross section observed at the lowest energies remains unexplained
and needs to be further investigated.

In general, the nucleus-nucleus potential in the low-energy region can be naturally
associated with the nuclear mean ﬁeld formed during the dinuclear collision [23]. As
a result, the so-called double folding model (DFM) which evaluates the nucleus-nucleus
potential as the Hartree-Fock potential uses a realistic eﬀective nucleon-nucleon (NN)
interaction and the nuclear density distributions of the two colliding nuclei [24, 25]. In the
present paper, we explore the applicability of the DFM to determine the nuclear mean-
ﬁeld potential of the 12C+12C system in the very low energy range (2-10 MeV), typical
of 12C+12C fusion, using both the original M3Y-Paris interaction [26] (constructed to

A MEAN-FIELD STUDY OF THE 12C + 12C FUSION

reproduce the G-matrix elements of the Paris NN potential [27] in an oscillator basis) and
its CDM3Y6 density dependent version [28]. The 12C+12C potential obtained in the DFM
is further used in the BPM to calculate the cross section and astrophysical S factor of the
12C+12C fusion reaction.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we give a brief introduction
to the theoretical methods used in this paper. The numerical results and discussions are
given in the Sec. III. The last section summarizes the main results of the present work.

II. THEORETICAL METHODS

II.1. The WKB method in the barrier penetration model

The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method is well known to provide a semi-
classical approximation for the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation. As such, the WKB
method has been used to elaborate the physics treatment of the BPM for nucleus-nucleus
interacting systems at very low energies, where the nuclear mean-ﬁeld potentials vary
slowly over a spatial region of the order of the system wavelength [5, 19, 20]. In particular,
the 12C+12C fusion reaction can be studied within the BPM based on the simple treatment
of the WKB method.

In general, the nucleus-nucleus interaction potential consists of the nuclear, cen-

trifugal, and Coulomb terms

V (r) = VN(r) +

l(l + 1)2

2µr2 + VC(r),

(3)

where l is the orbital angular momentum and µ =
is the reduced mass of the nucleus-
nucleus system, and m is the free nucleon mass m. The Coulomb potential VC is usually
assumed [29] as

VC(r) =

(cid:18)3 −

c(cid:19) Z 2e2

2Rc

if r > Rc

if r 6 Rc

(4)

where Rc = 2rcA1/3 with A being the mass number, and rc = 0.95 fm. The l-dependent
centrifugal potential is that arising in the Schr¨odinger equation with spherically symmetric
central potential. The nuclear potential VN given by the DFM calculation is used in the
present work to determine the total nucleus-nucleus potential.

Within the BPM [6], the fusion cross section of the particle ﬂux transmitted through

the Coulomb barrier is obtained from the l-dependent transmission coeﬃcients Tl as

σR =

π
k2

lcr

X0

(2l + 1)Tl,

(5)

where k is the relative momentum, lcr is the critical angular momentum corresponding to
the largest value of the orbital angular momentum that reproduces both the pocket and
barrier of the total nucleus-nucleus potential (3). VBl is the barrier height, i.e., the value

4

L. H. CHIEN, D. C. CUONG, D. T. KHOA

of the total nucleus-nucleus potential at the barrier radius V (r = RBl), which is diﬀerent
from the Coulomb barrier.

For the partial waves l with VBl < Ec.m., the shape of the nucleus-nucleus potential

around RBl can be approximated as a parabola with the curvature determined as

here r1, r2 are the radii of the classical turning points where V (r1(2)) = Ec.m..
II.2. Double-folding model of the nucleus-nucleus potential

(8)

(9)

In the framework of the BPM and the nuclear optical model [31], the nuclear part
of the total nucleus-nucleus potential is the most important input. From the physics point
of view, it is always of interest to determine VN starting from the nucleon degrees of
freedom, and the double-folding model [24, 25] is the most commonly used approach for
that purpose. In this model, VN is evaluated as the Hartree-Fock (HF) potential with an
appropriately chosen eﬀective NN interaction between nucleons in the target and projetile

VN = VD + VEX = Xi∈A1,j∈A2

[hij|vD|iji + hij|vEX|jii],

(10)

Treating explicitly the single-nucleon wave functions in the HF potential (10), the local
direct term is reduced to a double-folding integration of the densities of the two colliding
nuclei with the direct part of the NN interaction

VD(r) =Z ρ1(r1)ρ2(r2)vD(ρ, s)d3r1d3r2, s = r2 − r1 + r.

(11)

The antisymmetrization gives rise to the exchange term in Eq. (10) which is, in general,
nonlocal. An accurate local equivalent exchange potential can be obtained [25] using the
local WKB approximation [29] for the change in relative motion induced by the exchange
of the spatial coordinates of each interacting nucleon pair

VEX(r) =Z ρ1(r1, r1 + s)ρ2(r2, r2 − s)vEX(ρ, s) exp(cid:18) ik(r)s

M (cid:19) d3r1d3r2.

Here k(r) is determined as

k2(r) =

2µ
2 [Ec.m. − VN(r) − VC(r)],

(12)

(13)

A MEAN-FIELD STUDY OF THE 12C + 12C FUSION

where M = 2A, VN(r) and VC(r) are the nuclear and Coulomb parts of the total nucleus-
nucleus potential, respectively, and ρ1(2)(r, r′) is the single-nucleon density matrix. It can
be seen from Eqs. (10)-(13) that the DFM calculation of the nucleus-nucleus potential (10)
is a self-consistent problem. Therefore, the calculation of VEX is carried out iteratively
based on a realistic expansion method for the density matrix [25].

Among diﬀerent choices of the eﬀective NN interaction, a density dependent version
of the M3Y-Paris interaction (dubbed as CDM3Y6 interaction [28]) has been used quite
successfully in the folding model analyses of elastic and inelastic nucleus-nucleus scattering.
The density dependent parameters of the CDM3Y6 interaction were carefully adjusted
in the HF scheme to reproduce the saturation properties of nuclear matter [28]. In the
present work, both the CDM3Y6 and original density independent M3Y-Paris interactions
were used in the DFM calculation. To avoid a phenomenological choice of the imaginary
part of the nuclear optical potential, the CDM3Y6 interaction has been supplemented
with a realistic imaginary density dependence for the folding calculation of the imaginary
potential. The parameters of the imaginary density dependence have been deduced at
each energy based on the Brueckner Hartree-Fock results for the nucleon optical potential
in nuclear matter by Jeukenne, Lejeune and Mahaux, widely known as the JLM potential
[32]. Given an accurate choice of the eﬀective NN interaction, the DFM can be applied
successfully to calculate the nucleus-nucleus potential only if the realistic nuclear densities
were used in the folding calculation (11)-(12).
In the present work, the two-parameter
Fermi function was used for the ground-state density of the 12C nucleus

ρ(r) = ρ0/{1 + exp[(r − c)/a]}.

(14)

The parameters in Eq. (14) were chosen to reproduce reasonably the empirical nuclear root-
mean-square radius based on elastic electron scattering data as well as the radial shape of
the nuclear density given by the shell model calculations [24, 25]. Given the appropriate
choice of the ground-state density of 12C and realistic density dependent NN interaction,
the folded 12C+12C potential (10)-(12) represents the mean-ﬁeld potential [23] in the
nuclear medium formed in the 12C+12C collision. As such, the folded 12C+12C potential
can be used as the nuclear optical potential to study the elastic 12C+12C scattering and
to estimate the reaction rate of the 12C+12C fusion in the BPM.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

The reliability of the folded 12C+12C potential should be tested ﬁrst in the optical
model description of elastic 12C+12C scattering at low energies before using it in the BPM
to determine the astrophysical factor S of 12C+12C fusion. In the present work we have
analyzed the elastic 12C+12C scattering data measured at energies Ec.m. = 6−10 MeV [14],
using the complex optical potential given by the DFM calculation (10)-(12). The radial
shapes of the real (VN) and imaginary (W ) potentials folded with the density dependent
CDM3Y6 interaction, as shown in Fig. 1, are compared with the real potential obtained
with the density independent M3Y-Paris interaction. One can see that the medium eﬀects
given by the density dependence of the NN interaction make the real optical potential
slightly shallower in the center but more attractive at the potential surface.

CDM3Y6 interaction (solid line) at Ec.m. = 6 MeV is compared with the real
potential folded with the density independent M3Y-Paris interaction (dashed line).

The (energy-dependent) complex folded CDM3Y6 potential can be used as the op-
tical potential to study elastic 12C+12C scattering at low energies, relevant for nuclear
astrophysics. In the present work, we have considered ﬁve elastic scattering angular dis-
tributions measured in 12C+12C collisions at energies around the Coulomb barrier [14]. To
ﬁne tune the complex strength of the optical potential, a slight renormalization is usually
adopted for the best optical model ﬁt of the experimental data. Thus, the complex optical
potential used as input for the Schr¨odinger equation has the form

U (r, E) = NrVN(r, E) + iNiW (r, E).

(15)
Very good optical model description of the considered elastic 12C+12C data has been
obtained with the complex folded CDM3Y6 potential renormalized by Nr ≈ 0.85 and
Ni ≈ 1.0 (see Fig. 2).

One can see from the results plotted in Fig. 2 that the complex folded CDM3Y6
potential gives a very good description of the elastic 12C+12C data at low energies. The
eﬀect on the real optical potential caused by the density dependence of the CDM3Y6 inter-
action shows up in the diﬀerence between the results given by the M3Y-Paris interaction
(dashed line in Fig. 2) and those given by the CDM3Y6 interaction (solid line). Note that
these optical model calculations used the same imaginary part of the optical potential

obtained with the complex density dependent CDM3Y6 interaction. We found that the
inclusion of the realistic density dependence into the eﬀective NN interaction discussed
widely in Refs. [25, 28] is also necessary for the good optical model description of elastic
12C+12C scattering at low energies. It remains now to be seen whether this eﬀect can also
be observed in the BPM calculation of the 12C+12C fusion reactions at very low energies.
The nuclear folded M3Y-Paris and CDM3Y6 potentials have been further used in
the BPM to evaluate the 12C+12C fusion cross section using Eqs. (3)-(9), and the results
were used in Eq. (1) to calculate the astrophysical S factor of the 12C+12C fusion reaction.
The results obtained for the S factor are shown in Fig. 3 and one can see a reasonably good
agreement of the BPM results with the experimental data [10, 11, 12] over a wide range of
energies. However, the slight wiggling behavior of the experimental S factor in the energy

range of 2 to 5 MeV (see Fig. 3) cannot be reproduced by the BPM using the mean-
ﬁeld potential of the 12C+12C system. Such an oscillation of the S factor in this energy
range has been discussed as a resonant behavior of the 12C+12C fusion reaction [18, 33]
caused by the relatively large spacings and narrow widths of the 24Mg∗ compound levels
[34]. Although our mean-ﬁeld approach to the 12C+12C potential does not include any
resonance eﬀect, the average description of the S factor by the folded CDM3Y6 potential
is quite satisfactory, so that the mean-ﬁeld prediction of the 12C+12C reaction rate is
accurate over the entire Gamow range.

The results of the BPM calculation shown in Fig. 3 also show that the S factors
obtained with the density independent M3Y-Paris interaction are somewhat lower than the
experimental data and those obtained with the density dependent CDM3Y6 interaction.
Technically it is explained by the fact that the M3Y-Paris potential provides a higher
barrier in comparison with that given by the CDM3Y6 potential. Thus, the medium
eﬀects caused by the density dependence of the eﬀective NN interaction are not negligible

in the BPM calculation of the S factor, and this conclusion is natural in view of the carbon
burning process occurring in the dense baryon matter of very massive stars.

IV. SUMMARY

The nuclear mean-ﬁeld potential arising in the 12C+12C collision at very low ener-
gies has been constructed in the double-folding model using the realistic nuclear density
and the complex density dependent CDM3Y6 interaction, based on the original M3Y-
Paris interaction. The complex folded 12C+12C potential was used in the optical model
to successfully describe the elastic 12C+12C scattering at the low energies around the
Coulomb barrier. This same potential was shown to give also a realistic description of the
astrophysical S factor for the 12C+12C fusion reaction over a wide range of the energies.
The mean-ﬁeld description of both the elastic scattering angular distributions and
the S factor of the 12C+12C reaction at the low energies has shown a rather strong medium
eﬀect caused by the density dependence of the eﬀective NN interaction. The results
obtained in the present work also conﬁrmed the reliability of the double-folding model in
the calculation of the total nuclear potential for the study of the 12C+12C fusion reaction
in the low-energy region of the nuclear astrophysical interest.

The further use of the DFM in the calculation of both the optical potential and
inelastic scattering form factor is planned to be used within the framework of the coupled
channel formalism for the study of inelastic scattering with the ﬁnal state of 12C nucleus
in excited states, such as 2+ state at 4.44 MeV, 0+
2 state at 7.65 MeV, and 3− state at 9.64
MeV. Besides, at the low energies around the Coulomb barrier the dominant ﬁnal states
of the 12C+12C reaction are 20Ne + α, 23Na + p and 16O + 8Be, and it is of high interest
to estimate their explicit contributions to the total 12C+12C reaction cross section in this
energy range.
