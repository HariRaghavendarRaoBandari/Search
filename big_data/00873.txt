ABSTRACT
A tidal disruption event (TDE) – when a star is destroyed by the immense gravitational
ﬁeld of a supermassive black hole – transforms a star into a stream of tidally-shredded
debris. The properties of this debris ultimately determine the observable signatures
of TDEs. Here we derive a simple, self-similar solution for the velocity proﬁle of the
debris streams produced from TDEs, and show that this solution agrees extremely
well with numerical results. Using this self-similar solution, we calculate an analytic,
approximate expression for the radial density proﬁle of the stream. We show that there
is a critical adiabatic index that varies as a function of position along the stream above
(below) which the stream is unstable (stable) to gravitational fragmentation. We also
calculate the impact of heating and cooling on this stability criterion.

1 INTRODUCTION

When a star comes within a supermassive black hole’s
(SMBH) tidal radius rt = R∗(Mh/M∗)1/3, where R∗ is the stel-
lar radius and Mh and M∗ are the black hole and stellar
masses, respectively, the tidal shear due to the hole over-
comes the self-gravity of the star. The tidal force subse-
quently tears the star apart, with half of the torn stellar
debris bound to the black hole, the other half unbound (Lacy
et al. 1982; Rees 1988).

These tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been stud-
ied analytically, numerically, and observationally for nearly
forty years. The earliest analytic studies showed that the
˙Mf b, should scale
rate of return of the bound material,
˙Mf b ∝ t−5/3 at late times (Phinney 1989), and
roughly as
early numerical simulations supported this scaling (Evans &
Kochanek 1989). Dozens of putative TDEs have now been
discovered (e.g., Komossa & Bade 1999; Gezari et al. 2008;
Burrows et al. 2011; Cenko et al. 2012; Bogdanovic et al.
2014; Miller et al. 2015; see Komossa 2015 for a review of the
observational status of TDEs), and the rates at which they
have been discovered show tentative agreement with early
estimates of the rate at which they should occur (10−4−10−5
per galaxy per year; Frank & Rees 1976; Stone & Metzger
2014).

Coughlin & Nixon (2015) recently demonstrated numer-
ically that the streams of tidally-stripped debris were gravi-

tationally unstable when the adiabatic index of the gas was
set to γ = 5/3, resulting in their fragmentation into bound
clumps. These clumps, when accreted at discrete times,
caused the late-time fallback rate to ﬂuctuate about the
t−5/3 average (the minima being induced by the accretion
of lower-density material in between clumps). Coughlin et
al. (2016) then performed a more comprehensive numerical
study of TDEs in which the pericenter distance was compa-
rable to the tidal radius, varying the polytropic index of the
gas. They found that, for stiﬀer equations of state (γ (cid:38) 5/3),
collapse was induced sooner and was enhanced by a “post-
periapsis pancake” that takes place soon after the disruption.

Here we construct a model of the stream of debris pro-
duced from a TDE in an attempt to characterize its general
properties. We ﬁrst demonstrate the existence of a simple,
self-similar solution for the radial velocity proﬁle along the
stream in Section 2, and we compare it to the results of
past simulations and use it to determine the stream posi-
tion as a function of radial distance and time. In Section 3
we show how the stream width varies with density and radial
position. Section 4 provides approximate, analytic solutions
for the density along the stream and we compare these ex-
pressions to numerically-computed values. We analyze the
rough scaling of the density with time in Section 5, and we
also demonstrate that there is a critical adiabatic index that
varies as a function of position along the stream and time
at which the stream fragments. It is shown that, for an isen-
tropic equation of state, the critical adiabatic index is equal
to γc = 5/3 for the initial evolution of the stream, but at late

2

Coughlin et al.

times falls to as low as γc = 4/3 for the unbound portion of
the stream. Section 6 provides a discussion of our ﬁndings
and considers the results of including other eﬀects in our an-
alytic treatment, and we summarize and conclude in Section
7.

2 VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION

2.1 Self-similar velocity proﬁle

As was noted in Coughlin et al. (2016), assuming that the
tidal disruption takes place impulsively accurately approx-
imates the radial positions of the gas parcels from a TDE
when the impact parameter of the star is β = rt /rp = 1, where
rp is the pericenter distance of the star. This impulse approx-
imation states that the star is able to maintain hydrostatic
equilibrium until it reaches the tidal radius, at which point it
is “destroyed,” meaning that the self-gravity and pressure of
the resultant gas become negligible at this location and for
any moment in time thereafter. Therefore, each gas parcel of
the tidally-stripped debris moves solely under the inﬂuence
of the gravitational ﬁeld of the black hole.

When one applies the impulse approximation to the
SMBHs we are considering here, the orbital eccentricities
of the stream occupy a very narrow range of values centered
around one. Therefore, the velocity along the stream is very
nearly radial for times not long after disruption. Further-
more, as was also demonstrated in Coughlin et al. (2016),
the self-gravity of the stream keeps it narrowly conﬁned in
the φ and θ directions. As a ﬁrst approximation we can thus
let v(r,θ ,φ ,t) (cid:39) vr(r,t)ˆr, where v is the velocity vector of the
material in the stream and ˆr is the unit vector in the radial
direction pointing away from the SMBH. If we further ne-
glect the inﬂuence of pressure gradients and self-gravity in
the r-momentum equation, both of which should be small
in comparison to the gravitational ﬁeld exerted by the hole,
then the radial component of the momentum equation is

∂ vr
∂ r = − GMh
r2 ,

∂ vr
∂t + vr
where Mh is the mass of the SMBH.

(1)

As we noted above, the eccentricities of the orbits are
very nearly one for the entire stream. Furthermore, the rel-
√
evant timescale at any given distance r from the hole is set
by the local dynamical time, τd = r3/2/
2GMh, so a rea-
sonable assumption for the radial velocity is that it varies
self-similarly according to

(cid:114) 2GMh

vr =

where

is time normalized to the dynamical time at radius r. If we
insert this ansatz into equation (1), we ﬁnd the following
self-similar equation to be solved for f :

Figure 1. The solution to equation (4) passing through the criti-
cal point f (2/3) = 1 (blue, solid curve). The approximate solution
given by f = −1 +1/ξ , which matches the asymptotic limits of the
true solution, is shown by the red, dashed, curve.

where a prime denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to ξ .

In addition to this equation, one must also impose a
boundary condition on f in order to obtain the full solution
for the velocity proﬁle. To do so, recall that the speciﬁc
energies of the stream are narrowly distributed about zero
and are

r
which shows that f
is narrowly conﬁned to 1 initially. In-
vestigating equation (4), the location at which f = 1 will
correspond to f (cid:48) = 0 if ξ (cid:54)= 2/3; however, if f (cid:48) = 0, then it is
easy to see by taking more derivatives of equation (4) that
every higher derivative of f is also zero, i.e., f (ξ ) = 1 is the
solution if f (cid:48) = 0 when f = 1. Since we we require the en-
ergies of the gas parcels to be distributed about, but not
exactly equal to, zero, we see that the point f = 1 must co-
incide with ξ = 2/3. Therefore, our boundary condition on f
is f (2/3) = 1, which we note corresponds to a critical point
in equation (4)1.

In further support of the fact that f (2/3) = 1 is the only
boundary condition that can describe the debris stream, we
note that equation (4) can be integrated exactly to give

(cid:16)
C + f(cid:112) f 2 − 1− ln
(cid:0) f 2 − 1(cid:1)3/2

(cid:17)
f +(cid:112) f 2 − 1

= ξ ,

(6)

where C is a constant of integration. This equation cannot be
solved analytically to isolate f (ξ ); however, if we set f = 1,
the left-hand side of this equation is singular unless C =
0. The only solution for vr that smoothly passes through
marginally-bound portion of the stream must therefore have
C = 0. If we adopt this value of C and use L’Hospital’s rule
to determine the limit of f → 1, we ﬁnd, as we expect, that
ξ → 2/3.

Figure 1 shows this critical solution by the blue, solid

be shown, is f (cid:48)(2/3) = −5/2.

Figure 2. A comparison between the self-similar (red, dashed
curves) and numerical (black points) radial velocity proﬁles, both
normalized to the speed of light, for the debris stream produced
by the disruption of a solar-like star by a 106M(cid:12) black hole. The
numerical solution was taken from Coughlin & Nixon (2015), who
used the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code phantom
(Price & Federrath 2010) to destroy a solar-like star by a 106M(cid:12)
SMBH. The diﬀerent curves represent the stream at diﬀerent
times, with each curve corresponding to, from left to right, 11,
30, 60, 120, 180, 300, 451, and 601 days since disruption.

Figure 3. A log-log plot of the diﬀerence in velocity normal-
ized to the speed of light, i.e., ∆v/c ≡ (vn − vss)/c, where vn is the
numerically-obtained radial velocity and vss is the analytic solu-
tion (equation 2), for the same times chosen in Figure 2 (i.e., the
dark blue set of points is 11 days after disruption, the light yellow
set of points is 601 days after disruption, and each set of points
in between corresponds to the appropriate curve in Figure 2). As
discussed in Section 6.1, the small discrepancies shown here can
plausibly be attributed to the neglect of angular momentum in
the self-similar solution.

proximate solution f (cid:39) −1 + 1/ξ , which aids in seeing the
asymptotic behavior of the true function.

In order to assess the validity of the self-similar solution
in matching the radial velocity proﬁle of tidally-disrupted
debris streams, Figure 2 compares the self-similar solution
for vr (Equation 2) to the numerical simulation of Coughlin
& Nixon (2015). In this simulation a solar-type star (one
with a solar mass and solar radius) was destroyed by a
106M(cid:12) SMBH using the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) code phantom (Price & Federrath 2010) with 106
particles; the pericenter distance of the stellar progenitor
was equal to the tidal radius, the gas followed an adiabatic,
γ = 5/3 equation of state, and pressure and self-gravity were
included at all stages of the simulation (we refer the inter-
ested reader to Coughlin & Nixon (2015) for more details).
The diﬀerent curves in Figure 2 correspond to the stream of
debris at diﬀerent times, with the earliest (farthest left on
the plot) being roughly two weeks after disruption, the lat-
est (occupying the largest radial extent) at almost two years
(the Figure caption gives the precise times). This Figure
shows that the analytic, self-similar solution agrees extraor-
dinarily well with the numerical solution.

Figure 3 shows the diﬀerence in velocity, ∆v, between the
numerically-obtained radial velocity proﬁle and the analytic
velocity proﬁle, i.e., ∆v = vn − vss, vn being the numerical
solution, vss the analytic solution (equation 2), normalized
to the speed of light. Each set of points corresponds to the
time chosen in Figure 2. The small diﬀerences illustrated by
this plot may be due to the neglect of angular momentum
in the self-similar solution (see Section 6.1).

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2016)

With the function f completely determined, the radial posi-
tions of the gas parcels comprising the stream can be found
by solving the diﬀerential equation

where ri(t) is the radial position of gas parcel

Because f is not analytic, this equation cannot be inte-
grated exactly to give ri(t). However, we note that there is
an exact solution for the marginally-bound material:

time gives ˙ri =(cid:112)2GMh/r, which, from equation (7), demands

As a check, diﬀerentiating this equation with respect to

f (ξm) = 1. On the other hand, ξm =
m = 2/3, and
since our boundary condition is f (2/3) = 1, we see that equa-
tion (8) does indeed solve equation (7).

√
2GMht/r3/2

To determine the remaining positions of the gas parcels,
we will apply an argument similar to the impulse approxi-
mation: at some time tm, the stream is closely conﬁned to
the position of the marginally-bound segment of the stream,
with its radial extent equal to the diameter of the disrupted
star. We will thus let

ri(tm) = rm(tm) + δ ri,
(9)
where δ ri = µiR∗ (cid:28) rm(tm) and |µi| < 1. Furthermore, we

know that the tidal force of the black hole imparts a spread
of energies to the debris of (Lacy et al. 1982; Rees 1988;
Coughlin et al. 2016)

This shows that the correction to the positions of the ma-

This equation is just a Taylor expansion of f about the point
ξ = 2/3, and we used the fact that f (cid:48)(2/3) = −5/2 (see foot-
note above). We therefore have that

,

(13)

and using equations (9) and (10) and keeping only ﬁrst order
terms in δ ri, we ﬁnd that the positions of the gas parcels
satisfy

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)µ=0

= r1(t) ∝ t4/3.

(17)

Note that this result is exact, as all of the higher-order µ cor-
rections are zero at µ = 0. We will use this result in Section
3.2.

Finally, while equation (15) is useful for the early evo-
lution of the debris, it breaks down once the orbits of the
material start to deviate from ri ∝ t2/3. We can obtain an
approximate expression for the positions of the gas parcels,
one that is roughly valid over the whole stream, by recalling
that the function f is reasonably well-approximated by the
function

f (cid:39) −1 +

(18)

as depicted in Figure 1. If we use this approximate form for
f , then we can show that equation (7) can be solved for ri(t)
to give

(cid:16)
3(cid:112)2GMht + Ait3/2(cid:17)2/3

,

(19)

where Ai is a constant of integration particular to gas parcel
i. We can determine these constants by, as above, requiring
that the length of the stream is narrowly conﬁned, initially,
about the marginally-bound position, i.e., ri(tm) = rm(tm) +
δ ri, with δ ri = µiR∗. Doing so gives

Unfortunately, the value of rm cannot be determined by
requiring that the energies match those from the impulse
approximation; this is because the marginally-bound orbit
from equation (19) – where r ∝ t2/3 – occurs at ξ = 1/3, while
from equations (5) and (12) it occurs where ξ = 1/2. This
discrepancy means that the energies do not correlate with
the properties of the orbits, and arises ultimately from the
fact that the boundary condition f (2/3) = 1 is not satisﬁed
√
by equation (18). Therefore, in this case we will simply let
rm =
5rt – the same value found above when the correct
form of f is used – and note that the positions of the gas
parcels from equation (19) will diﬀer from the true values
because of the erroneous energies. We thus ﬁnd that the
approximate positions of the gas parcels are

Setting δ ri = µiR∗, we see that the time at which the energies

approximation. This shows that, if we adopt our self-similar
function for the velocities, we cannot impose the impulse
approximation exactly, which would amount to setting the
center of the star at rt at t = 0 with the radial extent of
the stream equal to 2R∗. This occurs because, by specifying
the positions of the gas parcels at some time t0, we auto-
matically know their velocities via equation (7) and, conse-
quently, their energies. Therefore, we do not expect that the
energies will automatically correspond to the correct values

3 STREAM WIDTH

The previous section exploited the fact that, to a very good
approximation, the radial positions of the gas parcels can
be found by considering them as non-interacting test par-
ticles in the gravitational ﬁeld of the hole; this notion is
substantiated by Figure 2. However, this will not necessar-
ily be the case for the transverse structure of the stream, as
self-gravity and pressure can be important at both early and
late times (Kochanek 1994; Coughlin & Nixon 2015; Cough-
lin et al. 2016). If we account for self-gravity and pressure,
the transverse momentum equation becomes

ρ

∂ vs
∂ s +

∂ vs
∂ r + vs

∂ p
∂ s = gsg + gM,⊥,

∂ vs
∂t + vr
where s is the cylindrical distance from the stream center,
vs is the velocity in the s-direction, gsg is the force due to
self-gravity in the s direction, and gM,⊥ is the gravitational
force arising from the black hole in the s-direction. Poisson’s
equation can be written

(23)

∇· gsg = −4πGρ.
(24)
If we assume that the radial dependence of gsg is small
in comparison with its s-dependence, which should be a
good approximation owing to the degree of symmetry of the
stream about its center of mass and breaks down only near
its radial extremities, then this equation can be integrated
using Gauss’ law to give

gsg (cid:39) −2πGρs.
The perpendicular component of the gravitational ﬁeld of
the hole can also be written down as

3.1 Quasi-hydrostatic width

During the early evolution of the debris, the pressure and
self-gravity of the material are high enough that the stream
remains approximately in gravitational equilibrium in the
transverse direction (approximately because the density is
evolving with time and the planar motions can cause the
stream to be slightly over-pressured, resulting in oscillations;
Coughlin et al. 2016). In this limit we can balance the pres-
sure and self-gravity terms in equation (27), which gives

Tidally-disrupted debris streams

Here we will assume that the pressure varies as

(22)

p = S(r,t)ργ ,

(29)

where S(r,t) is related to the entropy of the gas. A perfect
polytrope is obtained by setting S(r,t) to a constant; how-
ever, the stream of debris will cool radiatively as it evolves,
and will do so increasingly as the material becomes opti-
cally thin to the radiation released during recombinations.
Also, recombinations can heat the gas when it is still opti-
cally thick (Kasen & Ramirez-Ruiz 2010), and shocks can
likewise serve to heat the material if the star is on a deeply-
plunging orbit. To model these thermodynamic aspects of
the problem, we will therefore permit S(r,t) to be a function
of r and t that could, in principle, be determined from the
gas energy equation if all of the eﬀects controlling the inter-
nal energy of the gas were known. The equilibrium width is
thus

H2

eq =

Sργ−2
2πG ,

(30)

which is the same scaling found by Coughlin et al. (2016).

3.2 Shear dominated

Depending on the adiabatic index of the gas or the amount
of heating and cooling, the density will fall oﬀ at such a rate
that the tidal shear term on the right-hand side of equation
(27) will overcome the self-gravity (Coughlin et al. 2016).
The pressure gradient will also be insuﬃcient to balance
the tidal compression when this happens, meaning that the
advective terms on the left-hand side of equation (27) must
become non-negligible. In this limit equation (27) becomes

.

r3

∂ vs
∂ r + vs

∂ vs
∂ s = − GMhs

∂ vs
∂t + vr
We expect that the solution for vs will again scale self-
similarly, as the dynamical time is the only relevant
timescale and only the gravitational ﬁeld of the hole serves
to alter the velocity vs. We ﬁnd that indeed there is a self-
similar solution, and it is given by

(31)

(cid:114) 2GMh

r

vs =

s
r

f (ξ ),

(32)

where f (ξ ) is the same function that appears in the distri-
bution of the radial velocity. Since vs = dsi/dt, where si is

the transverse position of gas parcel i, and(cid:112)2GMh/r f (ξ ) =

dri/dt, we ﬁnd that the transverse extent of the stream
evolves as

Hi(t) =

Hi,0
ri,0

ri(t),

(33)

where Hi,0 is the width of the stream at time t0. When the
stream is dominated by the tidal shear of the hole, this equa-
tion shows that the width of the stream simply scales in
proportion to its radial position and the entire evolution
proceeds self-similarly.

6

Coughlin et al.

3.3 Approximate, full solution

The above two restricted solutions demonstrate that, when
the self-gravity of the stream dominates over the tidal shear
of the black hole, the width of the stream is set by hydro-
static balance. On the other hand, when the tidal force of
the black hole overwhelms self-gravity, H ∝ r and the entire
stream evolves self-similarly.

Along the full radial extent of the debris, the extremities
will typically be shear-dominated, while the density in the
central region is high enough to dominate over the shear
of the hole (Kochanek 1994; Coughlin & Nixon 2015). We
therefore expect the scaling of H to vary between the self-
gravity-dominated limit and the shear-dominated limit as
we traverse the extent of the stream. In between those two
limits, both the shear terms and the self-gravity terms are
important in equation (27), and as a result we do not expect
a simple solution for the velocity vs.

We can, however, obtain an approximate solution that
interpolates between the self-gravity and shear-dominated
extremes by simply letting H be piecewise deﬁned about the
point where 2πρ = Mh/r3. We thus have

To ensure the continuity of the solution, H0 and r0 are given
by the self-gravitating solution where 2πρ = Mh/r3. In the
next section we will see how ρ is related to H.

4 DENSITY

In addition to knowing the geometry of the stream, we would
also like to be able to infer its density. To do so, we note that
the mass contained in some segment of the stream is



H2 =

M =

ρ(V,t)dV,

(35)

where V (t) is the volume of the stream segment that is, in
general, time-dependent. The total mass contained in the
segment is, however, time-independent, so the diﬀerential
equation to be solved for ρ is

When the limits of integration in this equation are func-
tions of time, using the fundamental theorem of calculus
results in the continuity equation. However, if we can trans-
form to a speciﬁc set of coordinates in which the volume el-
ement is time-independent, then the resulting equation can
be immediately inverted to solve for ρ. In particular, if we
write the new set of coordinates collectively as T , then the
equation for ρ is simply

ρ

∂V
∂ T =
where ∂V /∂ T is the Jacobian of the transformation between
the physical (V ) and time-independent (T ) coordinates. Here

(37)

∂ M/∂ T is the diﬀerential amount of mass contained in the
volume element dT .
We can achieve the transformation V → T by choosing
our physical coordinates as (r, s, ϕ), where r is the radial
position of the center of the stream, s is cylindrical distance
measured perpendicular from r, and ϕ is the angle swept out
by s as it revolves around r. In terms of these coordinates,
the mass contained in any segment of the stream is

(cid:90)

M =

ρ sdsdφ dr.

If we further deﬁne the H-averaged density as

(cid:90)

then the mass is given by

In order to make more progress with this equation, we
must determine the quantities H(ρ,r), ∂ r/∂ µ and ∂ M/∂ µ.
As we saw in the previous section, H depends on ρ and r in
a non-trivial way, and will behave diﬀerently depending on
whether the stream is shear dominated or self-gravity dom-
inated. However, we noted that a full, approximate solution
can be obtained by assuming that H switches between its
hydrostatic equilibrium value and self-similar expansion at
the point where 2πρ = Mh/r3, which gives equation (34) for
H.

The most rigorous way of calculating ∂ r/∂ µ is to do so
numerically, i.e., calculate the positions of the gas parcels
comprising the stream, r(µ,t), via equation (7) for a large
number of µ and t, and at a speciﬁc time t interpolate over
all of the µ to determine ∂ r/∂ µ. However, we can also use
equation (21), which gives an approximate solution for the
positions of the gas parcels as functions of µ and t, to obtain
an analytic expression. Doing so gives

of the stream (this expression, however, gives ∂ r/∂ µ|µ=0 ∝

Finally, the function ∂ M/∂ µ can be determined by using
the impulse approximation and considering the star at the
time of disruption. This assumption then gives (see Lodato
et al. (2009), Coughlin & Begelman (2014a) and Coughlin

where Θ(ξ ) is the solution to the Lane-Emden equation and
ξ is the dimensionless radius of the polytrope (Hansen et
al. 2004). A slight diﬃculty arises from the fact that, if the
energies of the gas parcels using our self-similar prescription
are to match those from the true impulse approximation
(the one that accounts for the ﬁnite angular momentum of
the material), then the “time of disruption” – the point at
which the energies are frozen in – corresponds to when the

marginally-bound segment of the stream is at a distance of
5rt , not at rt (see Section 2.2). This means that using

the density, as we expect that the stream will have stretched
5rt and
by some factor by the time it reaches the distance

Since the functions Θ(ξ ) are only analytic for a select

ﬁed further. However, we can obtain an approximate solu-

Because H switches between its equilibrium value and

closed-form over the entire extent of the stream. However,
in the limit that self-gravity or the tidal shear dominates,
we can solve the equation exactly. Inserting equations (42)

the piecewise behavior for H (equation 34) so that the density is
shear dominated in regions where ρ < Mh/(2πr3) and self-gravity
dominated where ρ > Mh/(2πr3), for the same parameters and
times chosen in Figure 4. The yellow, dashed line shows the curve
Mh/(2πr3).

Figure 5 shows the numerical solution to equation (41)
when self-gravity dominates (left-hand panel) and when
shear dominates (right-hand panel). For these solutions, we
calculated ∂ r/∂ µ directly by numerically integrating equa-
tion (7) for a large number of µ (20000 points) and t, ∂ M/∂ µ
was computed numerically from equation (43) with n = 1.5
(γ = 5/3), and the physical parameters were the same as
those in Figure 4. We see that the positions of the gas parcels
disagree between the analytic solutions – equations (45) and
(46) – and the numerical solutions that used the exact, di-
rectly computed forms for ∂ r/∂ µ and ∂ M/∂ µ (compare for
example the locations at which the density of the bound
material goes to zero between the left-hand panels of Fig-
ures 4 and 5). In particular, the return time of the most
bound material is vastly overestimated because of the incor-
rect scaling of the energies in the analytic case. However,
the overall scaling of the density with r is upheld.

The solution that adopts a piecewise-continuous form
for H (equation 34) is shown in Figure 6. The diﬀerent curves
correspond to the solution at the same times as Figures 4
and 5, and the dashed line shows the curve Mh/(2πr3). We
see that these solutions possess properties of both the left
and right-hand panels of Figure 5: when the stream is self-
gravity dominated, the density retains an inverted proﬁle
and increases as we move outward in speciﬁc energy. How-
ever, when the bound material nears the black hole and be-
comes shear-dominated, the tidal compression serves to de-

crease the stream width and produces an “up-turn” in the
density proﬁle as we approach the hole.

Interestingly, the density proﬁle of the simulation in
Coughlin & Nixon (2015) does not exhibit this up-turn in
the density as the material approaches the black hole. This
anomalous behavior is demonstrated by the red points in
Figure 7, which is a particle plot of density versus r from the
simulation in Coughlin & Nixon (2015). The black points in
this Figure, on the other hand, are from a simulation that
is identical to that from Coughlin & Nixon (2015) except
that, instead of 106 particles, 107 SPH particles were used.
The green, dashed line shows the curve Mh/(2πr3). The fact

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2016)

that the black points show the upturn in the density as we
approach the black hole, consistent with what we expect
from the analytic arguments presented here, shows that the
disagreement between the simulation in Coughlin & Nixon
(2015) and our predictions arises from the resolution of the
simulation. Since the increase in the density arises from the
tidal compression exerted by the black hole, which results
from the diﬀerential gravitational force acting across the di-
ameter of the stream, we see that the width of the incoming
debris stream is underresolved when only 106 particles are
used.

5 DENSITY SCALINGS AND

FRAGMENTATION CONDITIONS

The most accurate way of determining how the density of
the stellar debris stream produced from a TDE varies with
r and t is to solve equation (41) numerically. However, this
direct way doesn’t yield an obvious trend for how the density
roughly scales with distance and time. Even from equations
(45) and (46), which give approximate expressions for ρ in
the self-gravity and shear-dominated limits, respectively, it
is not overly apparent how the density qualitatively behaves
as the stream recedes from the black hole. We can, however,
discern how certain parts of the stream behave by returning
to equation (41) and focusing only on certain energy, or µ,
ranges.

5.1 Marginally bound material

Recall that the marginally-bound segment of the stream cor-
responds to µ = 0, follows r ∝ t2/3, and, from Section 2.2,
satisﬁes ∂ r/∂ µ ∝ t4/3. Returning to equation (41), we thus
ﬁnd

H2ρm ∝ t−4/3,
(49)
where ρm refers to the density at the marginally-bound part
of the stream. If we now assume that the stream is self-
gravity dominated, then using equation (30) for H shows

3(γ−1) .

(50)

γ−1 t− 4

ρm ∝ S− 1
If the gas is isentropic, then, for adiabatic indices of γ = 1.5,
5/3, 1.8, and 2, we ﬁnd that ρm ∝ t−8/3, t−2, t−5/3, and t−4/3,
respectively, which is in good agreement with the scalings
found by Coughlin et al. (2016).

Equation (50) holds when the self-gravity of the debris
dominates over the tidal ﬁeld of the hole; however, if the
density of the debris falls oﬀ at a rate steeper than t−2, then
even if it starts out as being self-gravitating, the tidal shear
of the black hole will eventually dominate the self-gravity
of the debris. As we saw above, the critical γ at which self-
gravity and the tidal ﬁeld of the hole balance one another at
the marginally-bound portion of the stream, which we will
denote γc,m, is given by

γc,m =

5
3

.

(51)

When the tidal shear dominates the self-gravity of the

MNRAS 000, 1–17 (2016)

Tidally-disrupted debris streams

9

stream, the ability of the debris to collapse locally and frag-
ment is seriously hindered. Therefore, we expect γc,m to rep-
resent the critical adiabatic index at which fragmentation is
marginally possible: for γ > γc,m, the stream can fragment,
while for γ < γc,m, the stream is stable to fragmentation. This
interpretation is supported by the results of Coughlin et al.
(2016), who found that the stream fragmented vigorously for
γ = 1.8 and 2, fragmented at late times and due to numerical
noise for γ = 5/3, and did not exhibit any fragmentation for
γ = 1.5 (see also Section 6 for a further discussion of this
point).

When the tidal shear of the black hole overwhelms the
stream self-gravity, then using the fact that H2 ∝ r2 shows
that the isentropic density scales as

ρm ∝ t−8/3.

(52)

This demonstrates that the density of the stream will not
necessarily fall oﬀ as a single power-law throughout its en-
tire evolution. For example, if the stream starts out self-
gravitating and has an adiabatic index of γ = 1.5, then it
will initially follow ρm ∝ t−2.66 before eventually transition-
ing to the shallower power-law ρm ∝ t−2.22.
If we let the entropy scale as S ∝ t−p, which provides
some insight into the ability of heating and cooling to aﬀect
the evolution of the stream density, then it is simple to show
that the critical adiabatic index along the marginally-bound
portion of the stream becomes

γc,m =

5
3

− p
2

.

(53)

This illustrates that cooling does not need to be very eﬃ-
cient to signiﬁcantly alter the fragmentation properties of
the stream. Alternatively, if shocks play a signiﬁcant role in
heating the gas, then the ability of the stream to fragment
will be correspondingly diminished. On the other hand, once
the gas temperature drops to about 104K, the gas can start
to recombine and heat the debris, stalling its temperature at
104K and resulting in an adiabatic index of order unity. How-
ever, once the neutral fraction becomes signiﬁcant, the op-
tical depth decreases dramatically and recombinations will
serve to cool the gas, corresponding to a larger eﬀective γ
(Kasen & Ramirez-Ruiz 2010).

5.2 Unbound material

For the material in the unbound portion of the stream, the
gas parcels follow r ∝ t2/3 initially, but eventually transition
to r ∝ t. We therefore have ∂ r/∂ µ ∝ t when the material
recedes to large distances from the hole, and we ﬁnd that
equation (41) becomes

H2ρu ∝ t−1,
where ρu refers to the density in the unbound portion of the
stream. If we now focus on the self-gravity dominated limit,
using equation (30) shows

(54)

ρu ∝ t−1/(γ−1).

(55)

10

Coughlin et al.

From this expression we see that the density of the unbound
material falls oﬀ at a shallower rate than the marginally-
bound debris. Speciﬁcally, for γ = 5/3 we ﬁnd ρu ∝ t−3/2 as
compared to ρmb ∝ t−2. Furthermore, since the density of the
black hole falls oﬀ as Mh ∝ t−3 for the unbound debris as op-
posed to Mh ∝ t−2 for the marginally-bound debris, the crit-
ical adiabatic index at which the black hole density equals
the stream density is correspondingly smaller. In particular,
if we set ρu ∝ t−3, we ﬁnd that the critical adiabatic index
in the unbound portion of the stream is γc,u = 4/3.

When the tidal shear of the hole dominates the self-

gravity, using equation (33) in equation (54) gives

ρu ∝ t−3.
As was true for the marginally-bound case, this shows that
the density of the unbound material will not necessarily fall
oﬀ as a single power-law throughout its evolution if it passes
from being self-gravity to being shear-dominated.

(56)

Furthermore, because the energies of the debris are
greater than zero by only a small amount, the initial evo-
lution of even the unbound debris will still follow approx-
imately ru ∝ t2/3, and only at some time ttr will the orbits
transition to ru ∝ t. If we rewrite equation (15) as

where the second term in this equation comes from equa-

approximately

(58)

Thus, if the unbound stream is self-gravitating, then at ttr we
expect the density to transition from ρu ∝ t−2 to ρu ∝ t−1.5.
Equivalently, if we are following an unbound ﬂuid parcel
with a narrow range of speciﬁc energies, then we expect the
density to transition from ρu ∝ r−3 to ρu ∝ r−1.5 at this time.
For the disruption of a solar-type star by a 106M(cid:12) SMBH,
this time corresponds to ttr (cid:39) 48 days post-disruption.

5.3 Bound material and overall scalings

The above two subsections show that the marginally-bound
and unbound material behave quite diﬀerently in terms of
their asymptotic scalings. As was true for the unbound ma-
terial, the initial evolution of the bound material will follow
approximately rb ∝ t2/3 because the speciﬁc energies, while
being negative, are very close to zero. Since the bound mate-
rial inevitably falls back to the origin no matter how close the
energy is to zero, though, there is unfortunately no simple
way of discerning the asymptotic behavior of this segment
of the stream.
One quantity that gives some insight into its behavior,
however, is the number q ≡ d ln(ρr3)/d lnt as a function of
µ. When taking this logarithmic derivative, the quantities ρ
and r are considered functions of µ and t and µ is a constant.
Therefore, q gives the power-law index of the ratio of the

density along the stream relative to the density associated
with the black hole tidal ﬁeld as a function of time and as
we move along with a ﬂuid element.

Figure 8 shows a plot of q(µ) for γ = 5/3 and the dis-
ruption of a solar-type star by a 106M(cid:12) SMBH (S was set to
a constant). The left-hand panel gives the solution when the
ﬂow is dominated by self-gravity, while the right-hand panel
shows the case when the ﬂow is shear dominated. The dif-
ferent curves give diﬀerent times since disruption, with the
blue curve at (cid:39) 13 days after disruption, the brown curve at
(cid:39) 143 days after disruption, and each curve diﬀering from
the next closest curve by (cid:39) 26 days. As we mentioned, the
quantity q characterizes the instantaneous power law of the
product ρr3, i.e., the ratio of the density in the stream to
that of the black hole scales instantaneously as ρr3 ∝ tq.

These plots show us what to expect when we consider
lines of constant µ – when we follow along a single ﬂuid el-
ement. When µ > 0, the speciﬁc energy of the gas parcel is
greater than zero, and thus initially follow r ∝ t2/3 but even-
tually transition to r ∝ t for late times. We would thus expect
that, at early times, the ratio of the density of the stream to
that of the black hole should follow ρ r3 ∝ 1 (ρ r3 ∝ t−2/3) for
self-gravity dominated (shear dominated) streams, while at
late times it should follow ρ r3 ∝ t1.5 (ρ r3 ∝ 1) for self-gravity
dominated (shear dominated) streams. This behavior is ex-
actly shown in the left and right-hand panels of Figure 8, and
speciﬁcally the rate at which this transition occurs. Likewise,
if the material is exactly at µ = 0, it will always follow ρ r3 ∝ 1
(ρ r3 ∝ t−2/3) for self-gravity (shear)-dominated streams, and
this is seen in the Figure.

Figure 8 also shows how the density of the bound ma-
terial, ﬂuid elements with µ < 0, evolves with respect to the
density of the SMBH. As we mentioned, there is no asymp-
totic behavior for the bound material because it inevitably
falls back to the black hole. However, we see that the ra-
tio of the stream density to the black hole density always
scales as some power of t that is less than 1, and in fact this
power-law decreases as time increases. We thus expect that
all material bound to the black hole, if it follows a γ = 5/3
equation of state, will eventually become shear-dominated.

6 DISCUSSION

In the preceding sections we developed pseudo-analytical ex-
pressions for the velocity proﬁle of the debris, the positions
of the gas parcels comprising the debris stream, and the
density of the debris stream. Here we discuss how the angu-
lar momentum of the debris might alter these expressions,
make comparisons to the previous work of Kochanek (1994)
on tidally-disrupted debris streams, consider the fate of the
debris that satisﬁes the critical adiabatic index condition,
and explore how the entropy of the gas should realistically
behave.

6.1 The neglect of angular momentum

The solutions we have given here rely on the fact that the
angular momentum of the material is small enough to be ig-
nored when considering the evolution of the debris stream.
Since the φ -component of the velocity is approximately given

mentum of the material and rp (cid:39) rt is the pericenter distance
of the star, we ﬁnd that vφ /vr (cid:39) (r/rp)−1/2. Thus, the neglect
of angular momentum only breaks down for small radii, and
should be increasingly accurate as the pericenter distance
of the progenitor gets smaller. This argument also agrees
with Figure 3, which shows that the agreement between the
self-similar solution and the numerical solution gets better
as we proceed to larger distances from the hole (and, as a
consequence, the ratio of the angular velocity to the radial
velocity gets smaller).

One consequence of accounting for the ﬁnite angular
momentum of the material is that the position of the cen-
ter of the stream (in terms of its width) is not purely ra-
dial, but instead sweeps out some angle (see also Guillochon
et al. 2015). Thus, the extent of the stream is not exactly
(∂ r/∂ µ)dr, but is instead given by

where φ is the in-plane angular position of the center of the
stream; this is the equation employed by Coughlin & Nixon
(2015) and Coughlin et al. (2016). Therefore, the overall
length of the stream is slightly underestimated by ignoring
the angular momentum of the gas.

(59)

A more important consequence of the angular momen-
tum of the material is that the orientation of the tidal force
of the SMBH will change as the bound material returns to
the origin. Speciﬁcally, by assuming that the motion of the
gas parcels was radial with a transverse extent s, the tidal
ﬁeld of the hole only served to compress material in the
transverse direction (viz. equation 26) and increase the den-
sity of the stream. However, once the orientation of the cross-
sectional width of the stream H rotates to the point where
it is aligned with the radial displacement of the center of the
stream, the tidal compression will transition to a tidal shear
that results in a decrease of the density.

Figure 9 shows a rough drawing, not to scale, of the

Figure 9. A schematic of the debris stream, not drawn to scale,
returning to the black hole under the approximations set out in
our analysis (left drawing) and a more realistic distribution that
accounts for the ﬁnite angular momentum of the debris (right
drawing). This shows that, as the material gets very close to the
hole, the tidal compression becomes a tidal shear that serves to
decrease the density.

cross-section of the returning debris stream that illustrates
this point: the left side shows the current assumption about
the nature of H versus the position of the center of the
stream, while the right side gives a more accurate picture
that accounts for the ﬁnite angular momentum of the ma-
terial. From this schematic we see that, under the current,
radial approximation for the position of the center of the
stream (in terms of the transverse width), the tidal ﬁeld
of the black hole will only compress the stream and conse-

quently enhance the density near the black hole. In actuality,
however, the small amount of angular momentum possessed
by the debris causes it to miss the black hole, changing the
tidal compression of the hole into a tidal shear that actually
decreases the density.

6.2 Comparison with Kochanek (1994)

Kochanek (1994) also performed an analysis of the debris
streams produced from TDEs, in an attempt to discern the
nature of the self-intersection that ensues when the bound
material is swung through its general relativistic apsidal pre-
cession angle (roughly ten degrees for a solar-like star dis-
rupted by a 106M(cid:12) SMBH; Rees 1988). Here we make a brief
comparison between his ﬁndings and ours.
One important result of Kochanek (1994) was that, if
the impact parameter β ≡ rt /rp, where rp is the pericenter
distance of the center of mass of the progenitor star, is large
enough, then self-gravity will not be important for deter-
mining the evolution of the stream. Here we ﬁnd a similar
trend: from Figure 8, shear-dominated streams always fol-
low ρ r3 ∝ t−q with q < 0. Thus, if the impact parameter
is high enough such that the density everywhere satisﬁes
2πρ < Mh/r3, then the stream density will never be able to
surmount the tidal shear of the SMBH (although the un-
bound material does asymptotically follow ρ ∝ r−3).

Kochanek (1994) also found that the width of the
stream varies as H ∝ r1/4 for a γ = 5/3 equation of state.
This result ultimately comes from the fact that the mass per
unit length Λ ≡ ∂ M/∂ r is assumed to be Λ ∝ r−1 (see also
Guillochon et al 2014 for the expression when general γ are
used alongside this prescription). However, we found from
our analysis that the early evolution of the stream – when
all of the gas parcels are following approximately r ∝ t2/3
orbits – is characterized by

(cid:18) ∂ r

(60)

where the last relation follows from the fact that r ∝ t2/3.
Since H2ρ ∝ dM/dr, and ρ ∝ t−2 ∝ r−3 during this phase, we
thus ﬁnd

H ∝ r1/2,
(61)
which disagrees with the scaling H ∝ r1/4 found by Kochanek
(1994). For general γ, using equations (30) and (50) gives

H ∝ r

Figure 10 shows H/R(cid:12) at the marginally-bound portion
of the stream as a function of r/rt , with the solid, black
curve from the simulation in Coughlin & Nixon (2015) but
using 107 particles, and the red, dashed curve from the an-
alytic prediction H/R(cid:12) ∝ (r/rt )1/2 (the proportionality con-
stant was set to 0.33, which provides a good by-eye ﬁt). The
width was calculated from the simulation by ﬁrst determin-
ing the number of particles that had speciﬁc energies within
a small range centered around zero; for this plot, the abso-
lute value of the maximum energy was 10−6c2 (as compared
to the energy of the most energetic particles of ∼ 2×10−4c2;

curve shows the solution from the same simulation performed in
Coughlin & Nixon (2015) (i.e., a solar-like star destroyed by a
106M(cid:12) SMBH) but with 107 particles, while the red, dashed curve
shows the analytic prediction H/R(cid:12) ∝ (r/rt )1/2 (the constant of
proportionality was set to 0.33).

see equation 10), which amounted to roughly 105 particles
and a total mass of δ m (cid:39) .01M(cid:12) contained within the zero-
energy bin. The maximum and minimum radii, rmax and rmin,
respectively, within that bin were computed, giving a radial
extent δ r = rmax−rmin of the marginally-bound portion of the
stream. We then calculated the quantity dM/dr (cid:39) δ M/δ r,
determined the average density, and used equation (41) to
calculate the width. This Figure shows that the analytic
prediction of H ∝ r1/2 ﬁts the data well. The disagreement
between the prediction and the numerical results at early
times is likely because self-gravity is still acting to modify
the speciﬁc energies in the radial direction. This interpreta-
tion is supported by the fact that the number of particles
in the marginally-bound energy bin goes from ∼ 8.2× 104 to
∼ 1.08× 105 during that initial transient phase, after which
point it remains almost exactly constant.

Once the orbits of the unbound material transition to
r ∝ t, which occurs around 50 days for the disruption of a
solar-like star by a 106M(cid:12) SMBH, we recover the scaling
∂ M/∂ r ∝ r−1. Using the fact that ρ ∝ t−3/2 ∝ r−3/2 during
this phase, the relation H2ρ ∝ ∂ M/∂ r yields H ∝ r1/4, which
is in agreement with Kochanek (1994).

Kochanek (1994) also discussed how ionizations and re-
combinations, viscosity, and an ambient medium aﬀect the
evolution of the debris stream. We will return to these points
in Section 6.4, where we reconsider the entropy of the gas.

6.3 To fragment or not to fragment?
When the density of the black hole ρh ∼ Mh/r3 falls oﬀ
at a rate that is steeper than the density of the debris
stream, we expect that the self-gravity of the stream in the
radial direction will eventually overcome the shear of the
black hole. Equivalently, if ρ (cid:38) ρh, the dynamical timescale

r / rtH [RSun]1010210311025√
τd ∼ r3/2/
GMh, which is the time over which material is
√
sheared in the radial direction, will be longer than the free-
fall timescale τ f f (cid:39) 1/
4πGρ. Thus, in this case the material
is able to aggregate faster than the rate at which it is being
torn apart, and we expect the stream to be gravitationally
unstable. Conversely, when ρ falls oﬀ more steeply than r−3,
the ordering of the timescales reverses, and overdensities are
sheared apart faster than they can collapse. We thus expect
the stream to be gravitationally stable when ρ falls oﬀ faster
than r−3.

These arguments are supported by Coughlin et al.
(2016), who investigated, from a numerical perspective, how
the evolution of the debris stream from a TDE depends on
the adiabatic index of the gas. They found that, when γ = 1.8
and 2, the stream fragmented early in its evolution; from
our analysis ρm ∝ t−5/3 and t−4/3 when γ = 1.8 and 2, respec-
tively, and thus we expect the stream to fragment in these
cases. On the other hand, Coughlin et al. (2016) found that
the stream never fragmented – even after ten years post-
disruption – when the adiabatic index of the gas was 1.5.
From equations (50) and (52), the density should fall oﬀ
as ρ ∝ t−8/3 for γ = 1.5, which is signiﬁcantly steeper than
t−2 and we therefore expect, consistent with the numerical
ﬁndings, that the stream is stable to fragmentation in this
case.

Coughlin & Nixon (2015) and Coughlin et al. (2016) also
ran simulations in which the adiabatic index of the gas was
set to γ = 5/3. In this case, they found that the stream still
fragmented, but the time at which fragmentation occurred
depended on the resolution of the simulation. In particular,
if the number of particles was increased, the stream frag-
mented later and vice versa. This ﬁnding then suggests that
the stream is gravitationally unstable, but that the noise
inherent in the numerical method is seeding the instability.
Is this ﬁnding and interpretation consistent with our
analysis here? As we saw above, γ = 5/3 marks the critical
adiabatic index (for an isentropic equation of state) where
ρ ∝ t−2 during the early evolution of the debris. In this case,
then, the freefall and collapse timescales are proportional to
one another, and it is unclear whether or not the stream
should fragment.

To answer this question, we note that a precisely analo-
gous situation is encountered when one considers Jeans col-
lapse in the early Universe: as primordial overdensities form
and try to collapse, they are continuously stretched apart
by the fact that the background density scales as ρ ∝ t−2
(see, e.g., Coles & Lucchin 1995, p. 202). In this case, then,
the freefall and dynamical timescales are comparable, and
the fate of the overdensities becomes unclear. However, one
can show that there are still growing, unstable modes, but
instead of evolving as exponentials they only scale as power-
laws in time. To understand the origin of this result, we can
argue somewhat heuristically that the relation

˙δρ+ (cid:39) δρ+

,

(63)

where δρ+ is the growing mode of the instability and τ f f is
(cid:113)
the free-fall timescale, holds more generally than just when
τ f f is time-independent (and, as a consequence, the instabil-
ity grows exponentially). Thus, if we write τ f f (cid:39) t/

– the overdensities grow as power-laws.

For a star being disrupted by a SMBH, the character-

where α = ρ∗r3

These arguments illustrate that when the density of the
stream falls oﬀ as ∼ 1/r3 – which occurs for the early evo-
lution of the marginally-bound material when β ∼ 1 and
γ = 5/3, and also occurs for the shear-dominated portion
of the unbound stream for any γ – there are growing unsta-
ble modes. A more rigorous approach would be to perform a
perturbation analysis on the ﬂuid equations, and when this
is done for Jeans collapse in the early Universe, the results of
the heuristic argument are upheld (Coles & Lucchin 1995).
Since the problem is identical here in terms of the scalings of
the variables, it follows that the heuristic argument is also
valid, and for completeness we have checked that equation
(64) is recovered if one performs a perturbation analysis.

We thus ﬁnd that the results of Coughlin & Nixon
(2015) and Coughlin et al. (2016) are consistent with our
analytical arguments: when γ = 5/3, the stream is unstable
to fragmentation. However, because the dynamical timescale
and collapse timescale are proportional in this case, the over-
densities grow as power-laws instead of exponentials. This
considerably weaker growth rate means that resolving the
instability is much more diﬃcult, and the noise in the den-
sity that is induced by the numerical method becomes the
dominant contributor to the ﬂuctuations that seed the in-
stability. However, in the presence of a suﬃciently dense
ambient medium, the shear between the stream and that
medium would provide a physical origin for the perturba-
tions (Bonnerot et al. 2015).

Before moving on, we note that the simulations of
Coughlin & Nixon (2015) and Coughlin et al. (2016) found
that bound portions of the stream, speciﬁcally those very
close to the marginally-bound orbit, also exhibited fragmen-
tation. Based on Figure 8, we would not expect this, as
ρ r3 ∝ tq with q less than zero for the bound material. How-
ever, our treatment here of the radial velocity ignored the
eﬀects of self-gravity in the radial direction; it can be seen
from Figure 7, though, that the denser material towards the
marginally bound segment of the stream generates a gravita-
tional force on the bound material that serves to counteract
the gravitational pull of the SMBH. This additional force
will serve to reduce the amount of shear present within the
ﬂow, correspondingly lengthening the dynamical time and
conceivably allowing some parts of the bound material to
collapse.

6.4 A more realistic entropy prescription

Most of the examples we considered here assumed that
the constant-entropy nature of the polytrope was preserved
throughout the evolution of the debris. However, our equa-
tion (30) permits a radially and temporally dependent en-
tropy, which, through equation (41), would serve to alter
the nature of the stream. In particular, if the entropy de-
creases due to cooling, the density is correspondingly in-
creased, making it easier for the stream to overcome the
γ = 5/3 marginally-unstable condition (equation 53); like-
wise, if the internal energy of the gas increases, the width of
the stream grows and results in the gravitational stability of
the stream.

When the stream initially starts to expand, any cooling
is initially controlled by the fact that the surface radiates
approximately as a blackbody:

dL = σTe f f (r,t)4dA,
(65)
where σ = 5.67× 10−5 [cgs], dA is the area of the emitting
surface, and Te f f is the eﬀective temperature that is, in gen-
eral, dependent on time and position along the stream. The
assumption of a blackbody is justiﬁed by the fact that the
optical depth across the width of the stream is

where κ is the Rosseland mean opacity and κρ∗R∗ (cid:38) 2×1010
for solar-like progenitors (R∗ = R(cid:12) and ρ∗ (cid:39) 1 g / cm3). The
stream is therefore very optically thick when the stream
is still highly ionized, which justiﬁes the assumption of lo-
cal thermodynamic equilibrium (but see below for when re-
combinations start to change the opacity). The area of the
stream is simply dA (cid:39) 2πHdr, dr being the inﬁnitesimal dis-
tance along the stream. Since the total amount of internal
energy contained in the stream is comparable to the amount
contained in the original star, Eint (cid:39) GM2∗ /R∗ (cid:39) 1048 ergs for
a solar-like progenitor, any radiation escaping from the pho-
tosphere should decrease the internal energy on roughly the
Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale – thousands to millions of years
if the disrupted star is roughly solar. Thus, the early evolu-
tion of the debris stream should be very nearly adiabatic.

However, recombinations will start to occur as the tem-
perature of the debris reaches roughly 104 K. As recognized
by Kochanek (1994) and Kasen & Ramirez-Ruiz (2010), this
could have important consequences for the evolution of the
debris stream, heating the material when it is optically thick
and cooling it as it becomes optically thin. If the stream fol-
lows a γ = 5/3 adiabatic equation of state and is self-gravity
dominated, then we can show, by returning to equation (41),
using equations (30), (57) and (43), and the ideal gas law,
that the temperature evolves as

(68)

after disruption. This number could be slightly sooner or
later depending on the mean molecular weight (we adopted
m = mh = 1.67× 10−24 g) and the initial temperature of the
star.

Equation (68) should really be interpreted as an aver-
age value over the entire extent of the stream. In particular,
since the density, and hence the temperature, is maximized
near the marginally-bound portion of the stream (see Fig-
ure 4), recombinations will start to occur at a later time
than they will toward the radial extremities of the stream
where the temperature is correspondingly lower. Likewise,
the stream is not an inﬁnitely thin line, but has a ﬁnite
width H; near H the gas temperature is lower, generating
an earlier recombination time.

Initially – when the gas is still largely ionized – the op-
tical depth is quite high, as evidenced from equation (66),
meaning that recombinations will heat the gas and keep it
at a roughly constant temperature of 104 K. Once recombi-
nations start to occur, however, the decrease in the ionized
fraction will correspondingly lower the opacity of the gas
and allow more of the stream to cool, generating a “cooling
front” that moves inward from H (Kasen & Ramirez-Ruiz
2010). Thus, while recombinations will initially heat the gas
and serve to increase the speciﬁc entropy S, at later times the
optical thinness of the stream means that continued recom-
binations will actually serve to decrease the speciﬁc entropy.
The local shear within the stream could also serve to
heat the gas. If we prescribe the coeﬃcient of dynamic vis-
cosity by η, then viscous heating will modify the gas energy
equation via (Coughlin & Begelman 2014b)

where p is the gas pressure and S = p/ργ is the entropy as
we deﬁned it for a polytrope. We see that the right-hand
side of this equation falls oﬀ approximately as ∝ 1/r3 (as-
suming that the temporal and spatial dependence of η is
not too large), and consequently the viscous heating of the
gas should not play a large role in the overall evolution of
the debris stream.

Finally, the background radiation ﬁeld present in the
circumnuclear medium will also alter the thermodynamical
evolution of the stream. If the stream is optically thin, then
the entire stream would be maintained at the temperature
of the radiation ﬁeld Tb (in the most extreme case, Tb would
be the temperature of the cosmic microwave background).
When the stream is still optically thick, on the other hand,
the radiation will be reprocessed by a thin, outer sheath
(Kochanek 1994).

When the recombinations or radiation from background
sources start to heat the gas, it will become over-pressured
with respect to self-gravity. In this case, if we return to equa-

varies as

where

While the stream is still in the marginally-bound phase,

In this case, we see that γ = 5/3 still marks the critical γ at

7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented a semi-analytic analysis of
the debris streams produced from TDEs, showing that there
is a simple, self-similar prescription for the radial velocity of
the debris. Speciﬁcally, we found that if one assumes that

the radial velocity varies as vr =(cid:112)2GMh/r f (ξ ), where f is

a function of the self-similar variable ξ =
the function f is given by the solution to the equation

√
2GMht/r3/2, then

f (cid:48) =

f 2 − 1
2− 3 f ξ ,

(74)

with the boundary condition f (2/3) = 1. Figure 2 compares
this velocity proﬁle to the numerical solution of Coughlin &
Nixon (2015), and shows that the two agree very well (see
also Figure 3).

We also computed the cross-sectional radius of the
stream, H, as a function of time and density. We found that,
when the density and pressure are high enough, the stream
width varies in a quasi-hydrostatic manner as H2 ∝ ργ−2.
However, if the shear of the black hole dominates self-gravity
and pressure, then the entire stream evolves self-similarly
with H ∝ r.

The self-similar velocity proﬁle and the solution for the
cross-sectional radius of the stream allowed us, in conjunc-
tion with equation (41), to solve for the density of the debris
stream, ρ, as a function of space and time. Our approximate,
analytical expressions (equations 45 and 46) were shown to
agree well with the more exact, numerical solutions that
used the full forms for the quantities ∂ r/∂ µ and ∂ M/∂ µ
(see Figures 4 and 5). An inverted density proﬁle – where
the density increases as a function of r – is actualized when
the material is self-gravitating, while the density decreases

Tidally-disrupted debris streams

monotonically when the shear of the black hole dominates
the stream self-gravity.

We analyzed the general scaling of ρ with time and
distance from the black hole, and showed that, during the
initial stage of evolution when the orbits of the gas parcels
comprising the debris stream follow r ∝ t2/3, the portions of
the stream that are self-gravitating satisfy ρ ∝ t−4/(3(γ−1)).
This scaling demonstrates that γ = 5/3 marks the critical
adiabatic index above which self-gravity always dominates
the tidal shear of the black hole, below which the self-gravity
of the stream becomes negligible. On the other hand, the un-
bound portion of the stream eventually follows r ∝ t, which
shows ρ ∝ t−1/(γ−1) and the critical adiabatic index is γ = 4/3.
Finally, when the stream falls below the self-gravitating limit
(when 2πρ < Mh/r3), the entire stream behaves self-similarly
and ρ ∝ r−2 (∂ r/∂ µ)−1. During this self-similar regime, the
density falls oﬀ as r−4 when r ∝ t2/3 (marginally-bound ma-
terial, early evolution of the entire stream) and r−3 when
r ∝ t (unbound material, late evolution).

Finally, we showed that the ﬁnite angular momentum
of the debris, which was ignored in our self-similar models,
should have a small but noticeable eﬀect as material falls
back to the black hole. Comparisons between our results and
those of Kochanek (1994) were made, demonstrating that we
agreed on many aspects of the evolution of the debris stream
but disagreed on some; in particular, our ﬁnding that the
width of the stream scales as H ∝ r1/2 for a γ = 5/3, self-
gravitating stream contrasts the scaling H ∝ r1/4 found by
Kochanek (1994). We showed that when γ = 5/3, the stream
of debris produced from a TDE should be gravitationally
unstable; however, because the density of the stream scales
as ρ ∝ r−3 for early times, which is identical to that of the
black hole, the perturbations grow only as power-laws in
time (speciﬁcally, δρ+ ∝ t
t /Mh is the ratio
of the density of the stellar progenitor to the density of the
black hole at the time of disruption). We also considered
how the entropy of the debris stream might evolve more
realistically, given that the gas will start to recombine after
a certain time and that the ambient medium may serve to
heat the gas.

One of the important conclusions of this analysis is that
larger adiabatic indices provide enhanced gravitational frag-
mentation of the debris streams from TDEs, which is in
agreement with numerical ﬁndings (Coughlin et al. 2016).
Interestingly, this trend is in disagreement with those en-
countered in star formation, where larger adiabatic indices
prevent fragmentation (Larson 2003). The reason for this
discrepancy is that, as a gas cloud collapses under its own
self-gravity, the density at any radius within the cloud is
an increasing function of time. For an adiabatic equation of
state, this increase in the density then corresponds to an in-
crease in pressure, with larger adiabatic indices generating
correspondingly larger increases in pressure. This increase in
pressure then resists collapse to smaller scales. On the other
hand, the density is a decreasing function of time as the de-
bris stream generated from a TDE recedes from the black
hole, meaning that larger adiabatic indices generate more
drastic decreases in pressure for the same decrease in den-
sity. It is due to this loss of pressure support that the trend
of decreased stability for larger adiabatic indices is realized
in tidally-disrupted debris streams.

The adiabatic indices of most main-sequence stars lie

between 4/3 and 5/3 (Hansen et al. 2004). Based on the fact
that our ﬁndings here suggest γc = 5/3 is the critical adia-
batic index above which fragmentation is possible, one is led
to the conclusion that most stars will not be susceptible to
gravitational instability. However, it should be noted that
the cooling front initiated by radiative recombination (see
Section 6.4) could signiﬁcantly alter the equation of state of
the gas, causing the stream to transition from marginally-
stable to unstable. Furthermore, the critical adiabatic index
that demarcates the stability threshold is itself a function of
both position along the stream and time, and falls to as low
as 4/3 for the unbound portion of the stream at late times
(see Section 5 and Figure 8). Thus, as long as the stream re-
mains above the self-gravitating limit, the unbound portions
of many tidally-disrupted debris streams should be gravi-
tationally unstable. Finally, even though adiabatic indices
greater than 5/3 are diﬃcult to realize for most stars, val-
ues of 2 and greater are thought to be obtained for planets
(Faber et al. 2005) and compact objects (Lee & Ramirez-
Ruiz 2007). Planets tidally disrupted by their host stars and
the remnants of compact object mergers should therefore be
unstable to self-gravitational fragmentation.

Our investigations assumed that the density of the cir-
cumnuclear medium does not aﬀect the propagation of the
debris stream produced from a TDE. Because the original
stellar density is so much higher than the densities near
the centers of most galaxies, this assumption is justiﬁed,
with the bulk dynamics of the material largely unaﬀected
(Kochanek 1994). However, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabil-
ity could be important for modifying the density proﬁle of
some portions of the returning debris stream (Bonnerot et
al. 2015), and could also provide a physical length scale over
which density perturbations occur that cause the stream to
fragment. Also, once the stream propagates out to very large
distances from the SMBH, the stream density will become
comparable to that of the ambient medium, and drag eﬀects
will start to alter its motion as the stream enters a Sedov-
Taylor phase (Guillochon et al. 2015).

In order to make comparisons with past simulations,
we only computed the explicit velocity proﬁle (the one that
depends on both r and t) and compared it to the numerical
solution for the case when a solar-like star is destroyed by a
106M(cid:12) SMBH and the pericenter distance of the progenitor
star was equal to the tidal radius. However, we expect that
this self-similar solution is accurate over a very wide range
of parameters (SMBH mass, stellar mass, impact parameter
β , etc.) because it depends only on the local velocity and
the local dynamical time, and this concern only for local
quantities should be true for most TDEs (i.e., we expect
that the speciﬁcs of the initial conditions of the encounter
are rapidly forgotten as the stream recedes from the black
hole). Even for encounters in which the star is only partially
destroyed or recollapses to form a bound core (Guillochon &
Ramirez-Ruiz 2013), this self-similar velocity proﬁle should
hold for the disrupted debris and only break down once we
get very near to the surviving core.

The analysis performed here was done with the speciﬁc
application of stars disrupted by supermassive black holes
in mind. However, we note that many of the results we ob-
tained can be applied to other tidally-interacting systems.
In particular, the self-similar velocity proﬁle and the phys-
ical properties of the debris stream (the width and density

distributions) described here are also applicable to compact
object mergers (e.g., Lee & Ramirez-Ruiz 2007), the disrup-
tions of planets by stars (e.g., Faber et al. 2005), and con-
ceivably the tidal tails generated from galactic interactions
(e.g., Knierman et al. 2012).
