Muon spin rotation technique is used to study magnetic ordering in ultra-pure samples of
SrCu1−xNixO2, an archetypical S = 1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain system with a small
amount of S = 1 defects. The ordered state in the parent compound is shown to be highly homo-
geneous, contrary to previous report [M. Matsuda et al., Phys. Rev. B 55, R11953 (1997)]. Even
minute amount of Ni impurities result in inhomogeneous order and a decrease of the transition
temperature. At as little as 0.5 % Ni concentration, magnetic ordering is entirely suppressed. The
results are compared to previous theoretical studies of weakly coupled spin chains with site-defects.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Impurities and defects often have a profound eﬀect
on the ground states and excitations in low dimensional
quantum magnets.1–4 Due to topology, this is particu-
larly true in one dimension. In gapped spin chains and
ladders, where spin correlations are intrinsically short-
ranged, defects may in some cases enhance magnetism
by releasing new S = 1/2 degrees of freedom.5,6 The lat-
ter may behave as paramagnetic spins,7 bind into dimers
across their connecting chain fragments,8 or form com-
plex interacting one-dimensional systems of their own.9
In the presence of weak 3-dimensional interactions, the
emergent free spins may even undergo long-range mag-
netic ordering.10,11 In contrast, for gapless spin chains
such as the S = 1/2 Heisenberg model, defects of a cer-
tain type tend to disrupt the intrinsic quasi long range
correlations, suppressing magnetism.12–15 In particular,
they lead to a drastic reduction of density of states at low
energies16 and have a negative impact on magnetic heat
transport.17,18 For weakly-coupled gapless spin chains,
defects are expected to suppress long range magnetic or-
der, rather than enhance it.14 The ordering temperature
TN , for instance, is predicted to be reduced ﬁve-fold,
with the introduction of a small number of S = 0 de-
fects into weakly coupled Heisenberg S = 1/2 chains.12
It is the theoretical predicted eﬀect of defects on TN that
the present work aims to test experimentally.

Ideal candidates for such a study are the large-
J Heisenberg AF S = 1/2 chain materials Sr2CuO3
and SrCuO2.
These compounds exhibit excellent
one-dimensional behavior across a broad range of
temperatures.19 While they do order antiferromagneti-
cally in three dimensions at low temperatures due to
residual
inter-chain interactions, the ordered moment
remains very small.20–22 The most suitable technique
to probe such weakly ordered states is muon spin ro-
tation (µSR).23 Unfortunately,
introducing and con-

eye.

trolling spin-defects in these compounds is far from
straightforward.24,25 One problem is that Zn2+, a tradi-
tional S = 0 substitute for Cu2+, does not readily enter
the crystal structure during synthesis.25 To date, only
one focused study of long-range ordering in site-diluted
Sr2CuO3 has been reported. It was based on Pd2+ substi-
tution, but the exact concentration of defects was shown
to be diﬃcult to control, and no systematic studies for
the concentration dependence of TN was performed.
In the present work we focus on defects in SrCuO2

19,21.
Instead of using Zn2+ or Pd2+, we introduce defects by
Ni2+ substitution on the Cu2+ sites. Although Ni2+ is
an S = 1 ion, its spin becomes screened by quantum ﬂuc-

tage is that the techniques for precisely controlling Ni2+
substitution and ensuring exceptional sample purity in
SrCuO2 have been very well established in the course
of recent transport studies.17,18,24,28,29 Below we report
on a series of µSR experiments on this type of ultra-
pure samples. From these experiments, we draw several
important conclusions regarding long-range order in the
parent compound and in the Ni-diluted derivatives:
i)
contrary to previous reports of glassy behavior,21 mag-
netic order in stoichiometric SrCuO2 is a conventional,
entirely homogeneous state; ii) A Ni concentration of as
little as 0.5% almost entirely suppresses static magnetic
order and iii) the concentration dependence of TN for low
impurity levels is in good agreement with the theoretical
predictions of Ref. 12.

II. EXPERIMENT

A. Crystal growth

Single crystals of SrCu1−xNixO2 were grown using the
ﬂoating zone method.29 For pure and Ni-doped SrCuO2
single crystal growth, feed rods with 0.0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5
and 1 % of Ni doping concentrations were prepared using
SrCO3 (99.99% or 99.9995%, Alfa Aesar), CuO (99.99%
or 99.9995%, Chempur) and NiO (99.99%, Alfa Aesar)
powders. The powders were ground and sintered several
times at 900-990◦C and shaped in a rubber tube (diame-
ter = 6 mm, length = 80 mm) at a pressure of 2500 bar.
Subsequently, the cylindrical feed rods were sintered at
995◦C for 24 h in order to obtain very dense rods which
are necessary to initiate and maintain the growth exper-
iment. The growth was performed under an O2 atmo-
sphere with a growth rate of 1 mm/h.

The structures of Ni-doped SrCuO2 single crystals
were veriﬁed by x-ray diﬀraction (XRD) using a Pan-
alytical X’Pert MPD Pro powder diﬀractometer and Cu
K-alpha 1 radiation. The XRD measurements of pow-
der samples obtained by grinding a part of the single
crystals show that the crystals have orthorhombic struc-
tures (Cmcm). Their lattice constants, obtained by the
Rietveld analysis, does not change signiﬁcantly in our
doping region.29

B. Muon spin rotation technique

This study was performed on the LTF, GPS and GPD
muon spectrometers at the Paul Scherrer institute.
In
order to probe the magnetic ﬁelds in all muon sites,
the crystals were crushed and then pressurized into pel-
lets. They were attached either to a silver plate (LTF
instrument), a ﬂy-through sample holder (for GPS in-
strument) or placed in a CuBe pressure cell (for GPD
instrument). Most of the measurements were performed

substituted SrCuO2. The oscillations are suppressed already

in zero-ﬁeld conﬁguration. Additional longitudinal ﬁeld
measurements up to a ﬁeld of 120 G were performed on
the 0.1% Ni-doped sample. Spectra with applied trans-
verse ﬁelds of 15 and 30 G were obtained for the pure
as well as 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5% Ni-doped samples. Tem-
peratures down to 20 mK were used to measure the
samples. Data treatment was performed using MUSR-
ﬁt program.30

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

A. Magnetic order in pure SrCuO2

As a ﬁrst step, µSR measurements were done on the
stoichiometric parent compound. As noted, earlier stud-
ies have not detected clear signs of homogeneous mag-
netic order, but only an increase of relaxation at low
temperatures21. In contrast, the low-T spectra collected
on our ultra-pure samples (Fig. 1) show well deﬁned oscil-
lations. This is a clear indication of homogeneous static
magnetic order. As expected, above the phase transition,
the µSR asymmetry is well described by a Kubo Toyabe
type relaxation which is typical of paramagnetic materi-
als and originates from the interaction of the muon spin
with randomly oriented nuclear magnetic moments.23 To
describe the oscillations observed at low temperatures,
using several cos-functions yields unphysical 45◦ phase
shifts. After considering several models, we found that
the data are best reproduced by two Bessel functions,
corresponding to two distinct muon stopping positions

The resulting ﬁts for the low temperature Muon decay
asymmetry of the pure material are shown in solid lines
in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Bessel-type oscillations are indicative
of incommensurate magnetic structures,23 which is fully
consistent with previous neutron scattering studies.22
The measured temperature dependence of the average
internal magnetic ﬁeld at the two muon sites is shown in
the inset of Fig. 1, and can be viewed as a plot of the
magnetic order parameter. Two distinct precession fre-
quencies occur in the µSR spectra, corresponding to the
local magnetic ﬁelds of 80 G (75% of the signal) and 16
G (25% of the signal). Note that the observed ordering
temperature in our samples is higher than the 2 K value
reported in Ref. 21.

B. Magnetic order in SrCuO2 with Ni impurities

Oscillatory relaxation behavior has not been observed
in any of our Ni-substituted samples (Fig. 2). Instead, at
all temperatures, the relaxation is described by a simple
exponential form (Fig. 2, for 0.1% and 1%-Ni samples).
For samples with Ni-content x ≤ 0.25 % the measured
relaxation rate increases substantially upon cooling to
low temperatures (Fig. 3). This behavior is indicative
of either i) a progressive slowing down of dynamic spin
ﬂuctuations or ii) the onset of static but highly inho-
mogeneous magnetic order. The two cases can be distin-
guished in longitudinal-ﬁeld experiments. In the 0.1%-Ni
sample, the decay asymmetry was found to almost fully
recover under a weak longitudinal ﬁeld (Fig. 4), conﬁrm-
ing that the magnetic order is indeed static. For Ni-
content x (cid:38) 0.5 % the relaxation rate measured in zero
ﬁeld experiments is totally temperature-independent. In
this case, magnetic ordering appears to be totally sup-
pressed.

A more accurate determination of the ordering temper-
ature was obtained in transverse-ﬁeld muon experiments
that are a tool to probe the magnetic volume fraction.23
The non-magnetic volume fraction measured in several
of our samples in an applied transverse ﬁeld of 30 G is
plotted against temperature in Fig. 5. Note that the
plotted volume fraction is not normalized in the sense
that it includes contributions from both the samples and
the sample environment. As a result, it never goes to
zero at low temperature, even in a perfectly ordered sys-
tem. Additionally, even in the very low background GPS
instrument, the apparent non-magnetic volume fraction
remains ﬁnite due to one of the muon sites experiencing
very weak internal ﬁeld (as seen in the inset of Fig. 1). To
extract the transition temperature, the volume fraction

measurements for x (cid:46) 0.25 % were ﬁt to empirical sig-
moidal functions (Fig. 5, symbols). The central value was
associated with TN and is plotted vs. Ni-concentration in
Fig. 6. A “zero” value of TN for x = 0.5 % and x = 1 %
indicates a lack of magnetic muon spin depolarization in
zero ﬁeld. Note that the data include two distinct pure
SrCuO2 samples which appear to have slightly diﬀerent
ordering temperatures.

to sample quality. We unambiguously show that in ul-
tra high purity SrCuO2 samples the muon spins precess
coherently around the static local magnetic ﬁelds. More-
over, experiments on the Ni-substituted samples illus-
trate that even minute concentrations of impurities may
disrupt order. Crystals of even 99.9% purity are sim-
ply not good enough to characterize magnetic transition
in the parent compound. In fact, the muon spectra re-
ported in Ref. 21 for “x = 0”, look very similar to the our
data for x = 0.001. Similarly, the large crystals used in
the neutron diﬀraction experiments of Ref.22 may have
have been aﬀected by very small but signiﬁcant inhomo-
geneities, resulting in a distribution of ordering tempera-
tures. Even in our ultra high purity SrCuO2 samples we
see slightly diﬀerent transition temperatures in diﬀerent
batches.

The main result of the present study is the measured
defect-concentration dependence of TN (Fig. 6).
It is
generally in very good agreement with the theoretical
predictions of Ref. 12, represented in Fig. 6 by the solid
curve. The same theoretical work speciﬁcally predicts a
highly inhomogeneous ordered state, also fully consistent
with our observations. A similar inhomogeneity mani-
fested in a damping of muon oscillations has also been
reported for Sr2CuO3.25

The clear discrepancy between the predictions of
Ref. 12 and our data is the apparent total absence of
magnetic ordering in samples with 0.5 % and 1% Ni im-
purities. Based on the theory, we would have expected
magnetic order to survive, and TN to decrease to approx-
imately 0.6 K, which is still readily accessible in exper-
iments. Of course, our failure to detect magnetic order
may simply be due to a strongly suppressed ordered mo-
ment, outside the sensitivity range of our technique. Al-
ternatively, the total suppression of magnetic order may
be due to the double-chain structure of SrCuO2 and a
natural frustration of inter-chain interactions.19

In the course of preparing the present manuscript we
became aware of Ref. 31 that reports an enhancement
of magnetic ordering upon Co2+ substitution in SrCuO2.
Note that the case of Co-substitution is a fundamentally
diﬀerent problem from the one considered here. Co2+ is
a Kramers ion, and therefore does not lead to an eﬀective
breaking of the spin chains the way integer-spin defects
such as Ni2+ do.26

FIG. 5: Nonmagnetic volume fraction obtained from trans-
verse ﬁeld measurements of pure and the site-diluted SrCuO2.
The pure SrCuO2 was measured using the low background
GPS instrument as well as the higher-background GPD in-
strument. The compounds with impurities were measured
using the LTF spectrometer which also has a considerable
background. The lines are ﬁts to the sigmoid function as de-
scribed in the text.

FIG. 6: Ordering temperatures extracted from the trans-
verse ﬁeld measurements. The solid line is the calculation
from Ref. 12. While the ordering temperature in the samples
with low concentration of impurities follows the predicted be-
haviour, ordering was found to be completely suppressed in
the samples with 0.5% and 1% impurities.

IV. DISCUSSION

V. CONCLUSION

Previous studies of magnetic ordering in SrCuO2 have
left many unanswered questions, notably why the oscilla-
tions in the muon spectrum were absent,21 as well as why
there seemed to be more than one characteristic temper-
ature observed in the neutron study.22 Our present in-
vestigation suggests that both issues can be attributed

In summary, our experiments demonstrate that 3-
dimensional long range ordering in quasi-1-dimensional
spin systems is extremely fragile. Minuscule concentra-
tions of magnetic site defects disrupt the homogeneity of
the ordered state and even suppress ordering altogether.
Once again this emphasizes the importance of using sam-
ples of adequate purity in any studies of this kind.
