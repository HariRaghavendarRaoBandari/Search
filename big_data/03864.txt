Abstract. After a brief review of the cosmological lithium problem, we report a few recent attempts to ﬁnd theoretical solutions
by our group at Texas A&M University (Commerce & College Station). We will discuss our studies on the theoretical description
of electron screening, the possible existence of parallel universes of dark matter, and the use of non-extensive statistics during the
Big Bang nucleosynthesis epoch. Last but not least, we discuss possible solutions within nuclear physics realm. The impact of
recent measurements of relevant nuclear reaction cross sections for the Big Bang nucleosynthesis based on indirect methods is also
assessed. Although our attempts may not able to explain the observed discrepancies between theory and observations, they suggest
theoretical developments that can be useful also for stellar nucleosynthesis.

INTRODUCTION

The so-called lithium problem is one of the most resilient puzzles in nuclear astrophysics. It is quickly becoming as
well known as the solar neutrino problem which ruled for many years as a seed for the development of theoretical
physics imagination [1, 2, 3, 4]. It eventually was solved with an old idea: that neutrinos can oscillate [5]. The solar
neutrino problem is arguably one of the main reasons for the strong investment on neutrino astrophysics during the last
decades, which ultimately led to two neutrino physics related nobel prizes a few years back. It was a sad decision by the
Nobel committee that John Bahcall was not awarded with this prize as he was the most creative physicist in neutrino
astrophysics before and after the very ﬁrst design of the Homestake experiment [6]. Among several possibilities to
solve the puzzle was thought to be in nuclear physics, e.g., the 7Be(p,γ)8B reaction, responsible for the high energy
neutrinos coming from the core of the sun [7, 8]. But only a drastic modiﬁcation of the low energy astrophysical
S-factor for this and other reactions would solve the solar neutrino puzzle. The solution came indeed from the unusual
character of the neutrino as a fundamental particle, which took a long time to be proven experimentally.

In contrast to the solar neutrino problem, there are no hints that the cosmological lithium problem can be solved
without closely assessing the role of nuclear reactions, during the Big Bang, or in stellar environments. A few minutes
(∼ 4 − 20 m) after the Big Bang, nuclei started forming ﬁrst with the creation of the deuteron by neutron capture
on proton, p(n,γ)d. The formation of deuterons is strongly dependent on the baryon-to-photon ratio in the Big Bang
epoch, ηb = #baryons/#photons. After the deuteron bottleneck is surpassed, all other heavier elements are synthe-
sized, and are also therefore strongly dependent on ηb. Other important parameters of Big Bang nucleosynthesis are
the neutron lifetime and the number of neutrino species. Because deuterons are promptly consumed once they are
formed, a signiﬁcant amount of 3He is created by means of the (p,γ)3He and d(d,n)3He reactions. Tritium is also
synthesized by means of d(d,p)t reaction. The creation of 4He nuclei then follows by the 3He(d,p)4He and t(d,n)4He
reactions. After hydrogen (75%), helium (25%) is the most abundant element in the visible universe. The correct pre-
diction of the hydrogen and helium abundance is one of the major successes of the Big Bang model. It is necessary to
have a neutron-to-proton ratio, n/p = 1/7, when the Big Bang nucleosynthesis started in order to explain the observed
values of hydrogen and helium abundance. Thus, Big Bang nucleosynthesis occurred in a proton-rich environment.

A series of reactions involving neutron, proton, deuteron, and helium captures allow elements up to lithium and
beryllium to be created during the Big Bang. 7Li and 6Li, were synthesized in very small amounts, with the 7Li/H

abundance of the order of 10−10 and 6Li/H of the order of 10−14. Not only the deuteron, but also the 7Li abundance is
strongly dependent on the value of ηb. Big Bang nucleosynthesis is not the only source of lithium isotopes. 6Li can
also be produced in cosmic rays due to spallation reactions and 7Li can be formed in novae and pulsations of AGB
stars. Spite and Spite [9, 10] have noticed that the 7Li abundance was nearly independent of the metallicity in metal-
poor stars. Metal poor stars are deﬁned as those with a small Fe/H abundance relative to the sun. The logarithm of
this ratio is denoted by [Fe/H]. In low metallicity stars −2.4 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ −1.4. The observations were done for warm
(5700 ≤ T ≤ 6250 K) metal-poor dwarf stars. The nearly constant 7Li abundance, nearly independent of metallicity
and temperature, is known as the Spite plateau. White dwarfs at moderate temperatures have been used in such studies
because warmer stars, such as red giants, reaching temperatures in excess of 106 K lead to the destruction of 7Li
via the reaction 7Li(p, α)4He. Based on the Spite plateau observations, a reasonable conclusion is that lithium is not
created or depleted in warm dwarfs, even over a rather large variation of temperature. It is thus natural to conclude
that the Spite plateau consists in a ﬁrm observation of the primordial 7Li abundance, synthesized during the Big Bang
epoch. But it is important to notice that there have been recent observations in low-metallicity stars which seem to be
at odds with the Spite plateau [11, 12].
Big Bang nucleosynthesis leads to robust predictions which have survived the test of observations. Observations
of lithium abundance in metal poor halo stars [12] yield 7Li/H = 1.58+0.35−0.28 × 10−10 which is appreciably smaller than
the value of 7Li/H = 4.46 × 10−10 predicted by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) [13]. This diﬀerence has survived
a large number of tests and is the source of the lithium puzzle. An additional problem is the abundance of 6Li created
in the BBN by means of the 2H(α, γ)6Li reaction. When 6Li is formed within stars, it disappears quickly by means
of other nuclear reactions. One believes that it is mainly created by cosmic rays, but one also believes that it can
exist in the atmosphere of halo metal-poor warm dwarfs, surviving destruction by cosmic rays. But this assumption is
controversial, as the same hypotheses can be applied to 7Li nuclei. While the BBN predicts a primordial isotopic ratio
6Li/7Li ∼ 10−5 [13], some observations report a value 6Li/7Li ∼ 5 × 10−2 [14]. This discrepancy is an addition to the
BBN lithium puzzle and is known as the second lithium problem. Such ﬁndings have been disputed and the complexity
of 3D models for convection and non-local thermodynamical equilibrium in the photo-sphere of metal-poor stars can
lead to a substantial weakening of the second lithium problem, leading to isotopic ratios in better agreement with the
BBN predictions [15].

ENVIRONMENT ELECTRONS

It is well known that nuclear reaction cross sections at the low energies of interest for astrophysics are enhanced
because of the presence of electrons in the environment. Electrons bound in the atoms as well as free electrons, as
those present in stellar plasmas, reduce the Coulomb repulsion between nuclei and enhance the chances for tunneling
through the Coulomb barrier. There have been experimental evidences that the eﬀect of atomic electrons is not well
described by theory [16]. In laboratory experiments, the cross section enhancement due to bound electrons in targets
is larger than predicted by apparently all existing models in theory [17]. In stars, or during the Big Bang, the cross
section enhancement due to free electrons is quantiﬁed by the enhancement factor f (E) = σs(E)/σb(E), where σs
is the screened cross section and σb is the bare cross section, without inﬂuence of electrons. This factor is usually
calculated using the Debye-H¨uckel approximation, yielding a screened Coulomb potential in the weak screening limit
(for (cid:104)V(cid:105) (cid:28) kT), so that V(r) = (e2Zi/r) exp (−r/RD). This leads to an enhancement factor [16]

There have been some discussions in the literature about the magnitude of screening eﬀects and deviations form
the Debye-H¨uckel model [19, 20, 21, 22]. Applications of this approximation to the plasma in the core of the sun yields
3-5 of particles within the Debye-H¨uckel. This does not validate the use of mean-ﬁeld approximations inherent to the
derivation of the Eq. (1). A better method to describe the screening in such cases is the use of molecular dynamics
simulations [19, 20] but these do not seem to reproduce the mean ﬁeld models. Electron screening is also dependent
on the electron velocities in the plasma [23]. Some lingering questions remain on the use of the Salpeter formula,
Eq. (1), used to explain the experiments on electron screening [24, 25]. Other theoretical methods have also deﬁed
the traditional dependence on the Debye-H¨uckel approximation to describe electron screening in stars [26, 27]. Based
on this discussion and the theoretical diﬃculty to reproduce the experimental data on laboratory screening of the
astrophysical nuclear cross section and explain the stellar plasma screening at content, it is not far-fetched to assume
that there might be strong deviations of the Debye-H¨uckel approximation. In Ref. [28] this possibility was explored
in order to verify if electron screening could modify appreciably the abundance of elements formed in the BBN (see
also, Ref. [29]).

In the early universe, the electron density decreased strongly as the temperature decreased and it was much larger
e ∼ 1026/cm3). The baryonic density depends on the
(by up to 104 times) than the density in the core of the sun (nsun
temperature as ρb (cid:39) hT 3
9 (T9 is the temperature in units of 109 K), with h being the baryon density parameter [30]. h
changes value around T9 ∼ 2 from h ∼ 2.1 × 10−5 to h ∼ 5.7 × 10−5. During the BBN the electron density was much
larger than in the sun, but the baryon density was much smaller. The number of excess electrons is nearly the same
as those of protons, with most of the remaining ones being equal to the number of positrons produced via γγ → e+e−
processes. From these considerations, one can calculate the enhancement factor in Eq. (1) and show that it becomes
independent of the temperature [28],

where 1 ≤ w ≤ 104. The modiﬁed BBN abundances, Y(cid:48) were calculated using a standard BBN model [28] and the
relative change ∆ = (Y(cid:48) − Y)/Y is shown in Figure 1. It is seen that as w increases, the BBN abundances for 6Li and
7Be increase, but the abundances for D, T, 3He and 7Li decrease. But even if w is as large as 104 the modiﬁcation of
the BBN abundances is minimal. Thus, one concludes that the electron screening does not change BBN abundances
appreciably and much less it can be identiﬁed as a solution of the lithium problem.

NON-EXTENSIVE STATISTICS

For the calculation of reaction rates in the BBN one assumes the validity of the Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) distribution
of velocities of the nuclei in a plasma. The MB distribution is based on the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, which assumes
that (a) the average time between collisions is much larger than the collision time, (b) the interaction occurs locally,
(c) there is no correlation between the velocities of two particles in a given location in space, and (d) the energy is
conserved without transfer of energy from collective degrees of freedom. These are strongly constraining assumptions
which do not always hold for systems in thermodynamical equilibrium. Variations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG)
statistics have been proposed in Refs. [31, 32, 33]. In Ref. [34], the departure from the extensive BG statistics has
been studied in the context of the BBN. The motivation was again to check if this would have any visible eﬀect on the
lithium abundances and a possible relation to the lithium puzzle. We adopted the non-extensive statistics proposed by
Tsallis [32, 33], which encompasses a large family of entropies, each depending on a parameter q, which serves as a
measure of the departure from the extensive BG statistics. When q = 1 the BG statistics is recovered from the Tsallis
statistics.

The standard BBN model has been very successful and one cannot expect that a large departure from the BG
statistics is possible. That is, the non-extensive parameter q cannot be much diﬀerent than q = 1. In Ref. [34], the
value of q was varied substantially so that the departure from the BBN predicted abundances can become visible. The
deviation from the Maxwellian velocity distribution and its consequences for nuclear burning in stars has also been
investigated in Refs. [35, 36, 37, 38]. The entropy in the BG statistics is given by SBG = −kB
i pi ln pi, where pi is the
probability to ﬁnd the system in the i-th microstate. If A and B are two independent systems, the probability of A + B
j . This yields the extensive property of the BG entropy, SA+B = SA +SB. In
to be found in a state i + j, is pA+B

this case, a non-Maxwellian velocity distribution will be valid for particles in a plasma. For a Maxwellian distribution,

because the neutron-nucleus cross sections at low energies typically behave as σ ∝ 1/v.

The eﬀects of a non-extensive statistics for BBN has been used to make predictions for the abundances of 4He,
D, 3He, and 7Li and for the reaction rates of p(n,γ)d, d(p,γ)3He, d(d,n)3He, d(d,p)t, 3He(n,p)t, t(d,n)4He, 3He(d,p)4He,
3He(α, γ)7Be, t(α, γ)7Li, 7Be(n,p)7Li and 7Li(p,α)4He using the available experimental data of these reactions [34]. As
an example, Figure 1 (right) shows the 7Li abundance, where the solid curve uses Maxwell distributions to calculate
reaction rates while non-extensive distributions have been used for q = 0.5 (dotted line) and for q = 2 (dashed line).
We see that in both cases, the 7Li abundance increases. This also occurs for values either below or slightly above q = 1.

We conclude that it is not possible to solve the lithium puzzle with use of a non-extensive statistics to calculate the
reaction rates during the BBN. The departure from the BG statistics in fact worsens the lithium problem by increasing
its abundance. The details for the reasons of this increase are explained in Ref. [34]. As seen in Table 1, the abundances
of the other elements are also substantially aﬀected by a departure from the extensive statistics. A chi-square ﬁt to the
observations has revealed a very narrow window for the non-extensive parameter of the order of q = 1.00+0.05−0.02 [34].

NUCLEAR CROSS SECTIONS UNCERTAINTIES

The experimental values of the nuclear reaction cross sections of interest for nuclear astrophysics can be ﬁtted using
the R-matrix method, where the resonances and background are obtained by solving the Schr¨odinger equation with
matching conditions at a channel radius, or radii. The method leads to the reproduction of phase shifts and cross
sections described in terms of a small set of parameters, and by extrapolation one obtains the cross sections at the
low astrophysical energies. The matching condition at the channel radii leads to S-matrix poles at energies Eλ, and
reduced widths, γλ. The energy dependence of the R-matrix becomes

where i and j denote the reaction channels, with momentum, J, and parity, Π. The reduced widths, γλi are related
to solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation for each channel radius [41]. In Ref. [13] R-matrix ﬁts have been done
to a collection of data based on direct and indirect measurements such as those obtained recently with the Trojan
Horse Method (THM). Various nuclear reaction rates are among the most important input parameters for the BBN
nucleosynthesis, but only the main 12 reactions listed in Table 2 have been considered [42].

Universe, while dark matter accounts for about 25% of it.

clear from Figure 2 and Table 3 that the observed lithium depletion puzzle is not so evident when experimental errors
in the measured S-factors, or cross sections, are included.

More recently the second lithium problem, i.e., the disagreement between observations and BBN predictions for
the lithium 6Li/7Li isotopic ratio was discussed in Ref. [46]. While BBN predictions are 6Li/7Li ∼ 10−5, observations
yield 6Li/7Li ∼ 2 × 10−2 [14]. In Ref. [46] a re-analysis of the reaction 4He(α, γ)6Li was performed, including new
predictions for angular distribution. A nice agreement with recent experimental data from the LUNA collaboration
[47] was found. This result reinforces the BBN predictions for the lithium isotopic ratio and leads to a new value of
6Li/7Li = (1.5 ± 0.3) × 10−5 (see also Ref. [15]), which now seems to agree much better with the BBN predictions.
We conclude that it is not at all impossible that the problems associated with lithium abundances might not be due to
astration of elements, but to accurate measurements combined with better theories for nuclear reactions.

Dark Matter (DM) comprises most of the matter in the universe and almost nothing is known about it, except for
its gravitational properties [48, 49, 50]. Except for gravity, it interacts very weakly with known baryonic matter, or
perhaps not at all. Its existence is based on observations of galaxy clusters dynamics and anisotropies of the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB). It is possibly composed of hypothetic particles such as Weakly Interacting Massive
Particles (WIMPs), supersymmetric particles, sterile neutrinos, etc. DM could be built up of mirror(s) sector(s) of
particles [51, 52, 53, 54, 55] with each mirror sector being composed of particle copies of the Standard Model (SM),
but not exact copies with diﬀerent masses and couplings.

In Refs. [56, 57] a mirror model of parallel universes was developed based on a not fully explored SU(3) gauge
symmetry for multiple universes. Based on the observation for the density parameters ΩDM and Ωb, there are about
5 times more dark matter than visible matter, more precisely, ΩDM/Ωb = 4.94 ± 0.66. One can assume that there are
5 dark sectors and one visible sector (see Figure 2, right). The dark sectors are exact replicas of the Standard Model
(SM) of elementary particle physics. In Ref. [56] one has introduced a new Weakly Interacting Massive Gauge Boson
(WIMG) responsible for the coupling between all sectors, also with ordinary matter. The WIMG has to be a massive
boson, leaving properties of the SM and gravity unchanged. It also has to be compatible with BBN results and CMB
observations. For energies much lower than the electroweak scale, particles are basically massless and one can group
matter ﬁelds in terms of their intrinsic electric charges

s = 1,··· , NQ. Terms describing the quantization of the theory are not shown. The WIMG mass arises from the
µMb µ, by assuming a non-vanishing boson condensate (cid:104)φaφb(cid:105) due to local ﬂuctuations

of the scalar ﬁeld. With the additional assumptions that (cid:104)φa(cid:105) = 0 and (cid:104)φaφb(cid:105) = v2δab, and using tr(T aT b) = 3 δab, one
gets for the WIMG mass the value M2 = 3 g2
Mv2. The new degrees of freedom will increase the early universe
expansion rate [58] with implications for the BBN.

These are the number of degrees of freedom during the BBN, gB(F) for bosons (fermions), B(F), with temperatures

If the dark sectors were decoupled, two temperatures would emerge: T for ordinary matter and T(cid:48) for the dark
sectors. The energy ρ(cid:48)(T(cid:48)) and entropy s(cid:48)(T(cid:48)) densities for the dark sectors are given by Eqs. (11) with the sub-
s(T(cid:48)), and T → T(cid:48). Separate conservation of entropy in visible and dark

sectors yields a time independent parameter x = (s(cid:48)/s)1/3. If each dark sector has the same matter content as in the
visible sector, gs(T0) = g(cid:48)
0), leading to x = T(cid:48)/T. The Friedman equation for a radiation dominated epoch is
sectors. Using the relation (11) for the density in the dark sectors, ρ(cid:48), leads to

H(t) = (cid:112)(cid:0)8π/3c2(cid:1) GN ¯ρ, with the total energy density ¯ρ = ρ + NDM ρ(cid:48), where NDM = NQ − 1 is the number of dark
(cid:1)4/3 ∼ 1, for a not too small T(cid:48)/T [58]. At a BBN temperature

of about 1 MeV, the degrees of freedom of photons, electrons, positrons and neutrinos are in quasi-equilibrium and
g∗(T = 1 MeV) = 10.75. Due to the additional dark particles, g∗ changes to ¯g∗ = g∗
. If one tries
to explain the 4He, 3He, and D abundances, one gets [56] T(cid:48)/T < 0.78/N1/4
DM. With NDM = 5, this yields T(cid:48)/T <
0.52, i.e., dark universes have to be always colder than our universe if the observed element abundances are to be
reproduced. Other interesting features of the model is that the baryon-to-photon ratio for the dark sectors comes at as
b ∼ 2.1 N3/4
b ∼ 7ηb, i.e., BBN runs very diﬀerently in the visible and in the dark
η(cid:48)
and cold sectors. The additional degrees of freedom were forced to reproduce the observed abundances in the visible
universe. Ref. [56] proved that such a model is compatible with what is observed in the visible universe. But turning
the argument around and assuming that the similar conditions in the dark sectors were varied, the model would predict
diﬀerent temperatures, baryon-to-photon ratios, and other changes in the visible universe. The impact of these changes
on BBN in our visible universe are entirely open to imagination. The lithium problem might ﬁnd a solution in this
way, but at this point in history we cannot really ascertain what would be the physical properties of the dark sectors
and what would they mean if no other probes than gravity and a highly hypothetical WIMG would exist.

CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have discussed a few studies by our group at Texas A&M University (Commerce & College Station)
on the cosmological lithium problem. The goal is by no means to make a comprehensive review of this research ﬁeld.
For this purpose, there exist much more authoritative reviews in the literature (see, e.g., Refs. [59, 60]).

The lithium puzzle is associated with the BBN prediction of 7Li being larger than what is observed. The puzzle
recalls an equivalent situation with the solar neutrino problem many decades ago. It might be that there is no puzzle
at all. The solution might lie in the way that lithium is processed in stars. The solution might as well be in the realm
of nuclear physics. As we have discussed in this text, another lithium problem, i.e., the large diﬀerence between BBN
predictions and observations for the isotopic ratio 6Li/7Li, might ﬁnd its solution in the more precise experiments
combined with better nuclear reaction theory [46]. Similar cases such as the electron screening puzzle mentioned
earlier have recently found a likely solution also in the realm of nuclear physics. For example, as a nuclear clustering
phenomena in light nuclei, instead of a solution in atomic physics. Since 7Li is produced mainly via the electron
capture process 7Be + e− →7 Li + νe, the destruction of 7Be via several channels could also become a possible solution
for the puzzle [62]. The fact is that to the present date there is no solid key for this puzzle that has survived detailed
tests in theory and experiment. As in the case of the solar neutrino problem, with Pontecorvo’s proposition of neutrino
oscillations [5], the answer for the cosmological lithium problem might already have been found and is waiting out
there for a conﬁrmation.
