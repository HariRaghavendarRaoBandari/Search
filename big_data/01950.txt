ABSTRACT
We propose a qualitative scenario to interpret the argued association between the
recent direct measurement of the gravitational wave event GW150914 by LIGO-Virgo
collaborations and the hard X-ray transient detected by Fermi-GBM 0.4 sec after.
In a binary system of two gravitationally collapsing objects with a non-vanishing
electric charge, the compenetration of the two magnetospheres occurring during the
coalescence, through turbulent magnetic reconnection, produces a highly collimated
relativistic outﬂow that becomes optically thin and shines in the GBM ﬁeld of view.
We propose that this process should be expected as a commonplace in the future joint
gravitational/electromagnetic detections.

Key words: Physical Data and Processes: turbulence; ISM: cosmic rays, magnetic
ﬁelds.

1 INTRODUCTION

The recently and long-awaited direct detection of a gravita-
tional waves source (GW150914) by the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) collaboration with
the Virgo collaboration (Abbott et al. 2016a) was shown to
be consistent with numerical simulations of the merger of a
black hole (BH) binary system with masses ∼ 30M(cid:12) (Ab-
bott et al. 2016b). It has been already stressed that this
result is groundbreaking in several respects: it shows that
binaries of gravitationally collapsed objects exist and merge
within the age of the universe. The merger of binary su-
permassive BHs has been shown by a number of numerical
simulations (Palenzuela et al. 2010; Alic et al. 2012) to pro-
duce a collimated electromagnetic ﬂash accompanying the
GW event. However, standard scalings in the pioneeristic
work by Blanford & Znajek (1977) are inconsistent with the
large luminosity (1049 erg/s) of the transient signal detected
by Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi
satellite at photon energy > 50 keV (Connaughton et al.
2016), as discussed by Lyutikov (2016). Owing to the ex-
ceptional impact of such an association, it seems worth ex-
ploring at least qualitatively a possible scenario for the joint
events as already done, e.g., in Loeb (2016); Zhang (2016).
The widely accepted Blanford-Znajek mechanism en-
visages supermassive rotating BHs (typically M ∼ 108M(cid:12))
powering electromagnetic jets with luminosity L ∼ 1045
erg/s and with circum-BH disks currents sustaining a mag-
netic ﬁeld near the BH of order of 104 gauss. The luminosity

of the GBM transient combined with 30M(cid:12) BHs makes the
association of GW150914 with the GBM transient unlikely
as it would imply implausibly high magnetic ﬁelds. We pro-
pose that the compenetration of the two magnetospheres
ampliﬁes by orders of magnitude the magnetic energy and
drive, through reconnection, the release of a relativistically
hot and optically thick pair plasma. We argue in this short
note that the latter scenario might be a commonplace elec-
tromagnetic source associated with merger of collapsed ob-
jects.

2 MODEL

√

The source of GW 150914 very likely comprises of two ob-
jects at the ﬁnal stage of their gravitational collapse, close to
their respective horizons, inspiralling and moving at a good
fraction of the speed of light. Even if only mass (M ), charge
(Q) and spin (S) are BHs observables, it is customary to
assume that stationary BHs in the universe have no sub-
GM (cid:28) 1 in geometric units) for a far-
stantial charge (Q/
√
away observer. We allow for each of the collapsing objects to
GM (cid:28) 1
carry a non-vanishing global electric charge Q/
and spin angular momentum S. We have no argument to
support that the charge cannot be quenched as it is custom-
arily assumed; we merely examine here the consequences of
a magnetosphere supported by an intrinsic electric charge
during the inspiral. If the two spins S are anti-aligned and
approximately orthogonal to the orbital plane, the compres-
sion of the anti-parallel magnetic ﬁeld lines within the cur-

rent sheet separating the two magnetospheres1 will drive a
violent turbulent magnetic reconnection, which can eject a
relativistically hot pair plasma that later emits the hard X-
rays signal detected by Fermi.

The problem of gravitational collapse of an electrically
charged and spherically symmetric shell has been long inves-
tigated (Israel 1966). Astrophysical implications of a charged
collapsing object have been explored in the past two decades
in connection with GRBs prompt and afterglow high-energy
light curves (see, e.g., Ruﬃni et al. (2001)) and X− and
γ-ray band spectral evolution (Fraschetti et al. 2006).

For a stationary isolated Kerr-Newman BH, it is well-
known that, upon developing the general relativistic solu-
tion in a far-away observer rest frame, the leading com-
ponents to order 1/r of the electromagnetic stress-energy
tensor Fµν behave, as for the magnetic ﬁeld B, as magnetic
dipole: Br = Fθφ ∼ 2Qa/r3cosθ, Bθ = Fφr ∼ Qa/r3sinθ and
Bφ = Frθ ∼ 0, where a = S/M is the angular momentum
of spin per mass unit and t, r, θ, φ are Boyer and Lindquist
(1967) coordinates. The space-time geometry within a bi-
nary BH circular orbit is accessible only through numeri-
cal simulations and an analytical formulation is not known
to date and possibly inexistent. Our ﬁrst ansatz is that the
magnetic dipole structure is approximately preserved within
the inspiralling orbit.

Turbulent magnetic reconnection has been repeatedly
invoked in the past decade to explain the production of
non-thermal particles populations, beside thermal heating,
for those observations that were not complying with time-
space constraints of well-understood mechanisms or with
ideal MHD, traditionally in solar ﬂares (Parker 1957) and
more recently in the intensity peak of energetic particles
at solar termination shock (Zank et al. 2015), and in rela-
tivistic astrophysical outﬂows (see Kagan et al. (2015) and
references therein).

We argue that, during the last phase of the magneto-
spheres coalescence, turbulent compenetration at the cur-
rent sheet layer dissipates magnetic energy into relativis-
tically hot thermal pair plasma and non-thermal particles
ejected in a highly collimated relativistic outﬂow. A cartoon
illustration in Fig. 1 shows the current sheet layer that ejects
the thermal pair plasma into the downstream cone along
x-axis. The electric ﬁeld Ez accelerates particles (electrons
along −z and positrons along +z) as long as the particles
remain conﬁned within the boundary layer and gives rise to
a non-thermal distribution (see, e.g., recent simulations of
relativistic reconnection in ﬂat space-time in Cerutti et al.
(2013)). Assuming Bz = 0 does not alter the main process
in this simpliﬁed scenario.

The relativistic highly collimated thermal plasma of
pairs electron-positrons and photons outﬂowing the recon-
necting region will propagate (bulk Lorentz Γ ∼ 100) as far
as the plasma rest frame opacity of the high-energy γ-ray
to the electron-positron pair production drops to 1 (as dis-
cussed for GRBs in Piran & Shemi (1993)); at this point
the electromagnetic radiation is released in a single pulse

detected at Earth as the GBM transient of arrival time ta
duration given by ∆ta ∼ 1 sec. The GW signal emitted at
the binary merger travels undisturbed presumably at the
speed of light with inﬁnite mean free path. It has been al-
ready estimated (Zhang 2016) that the observed arrival time
delay ∆ta is compatible with a distance travelled by an ultra-
relativistic plasma (Γ ∼ 100) of order of 1014 cm. At such
a distance from the coalescence location, much larger than
the clean circum-merger medium, the ejected plasma emits
the GBM ﬂash2.

3 DISCUSSION

The scenario qualitatively described above requires obvi-
ously a detailed demonstration through analytic estimates
or extended resistive general relativistic MHD simulations.
We only argue here that the process of magnetic reconnec-
tion at the compenetration of magnetospheres of compact
objects might be considerable source of electromagnetic ra-
diation. The reconnection growth rate in force-free relativis-
tic reconnection (Lyutikov 2003) can be cast as
γ (cid:39) 1/

where τA is the Alfv´en time-scale and τR the resistive time-
scale, both measured in the local Lorentz frame. By using
the estimate of γ for magnetars magnetosphere (Lyutikov
2003), one can approximate the reconnection rate for a cur-
rent sheet thickness of L = L106 106 cm as
τ ∼ 1/γ ∼ 10

apply to this case because the two merging systems are not iso-
lated and the surrounding space-time of each system is largely
deformed by the companion.

baryon-loaded, an afterglow at longer wavelengths might be ex-
pected.

port that reconnection produces energetic particles power-
laws in various astrophysical contexts (Kagan et al. 2015).
This scenario will be further investigated within either
the framework of tearing mode instabilities, or Petschek
model of two slow mode shocks (Lyubarsky 2005), both
cases in the incompressible regime as usually assumed in
the literature. We hope that the scenario here proposed for
the claimed association of the directly detected GW signal
with a hard X-ray transient signal, and the expected future
joint detections, will stimulate fresh thoughts and prompt
detailed resistive general relativity numerical investigations.

gravitational redshift in the unknown space-time geometry
(we remind that the frequency at the observer frame νobs is
shifed from the frequency in the source frame νs by a fac-
tor νobs/ν = (1 − GM/c2r), for the Schwarzschild metric,
that can be very small close to the horizon)3. However, on
the very short merging time-scale due to highly relativistic
ﬂow speed involved, the actual reconnection can be limited
to a current sheet thickness L (cid:28) 106 cm, greatly reduc-
ing τ (Lyubarsky 2005). The conversion of τ to the observer
frame is also aﬀected by Doppler shift (D = Γ[1−(v/c)cosθ],
where v is the source speed and θ is the angle of the direc-
tion of photon emission with respect to the line of sight to
the observer located far away from the source), arrival time
dilation due to the fact that two photons emitted with a
certain time-lag ∆t in the plasma comoving frame are de-
tected with a diﬀerent time-lag by the observer at Earth
∆ta because the source is moving (∆ta ∼ ∆t/2Γ2) and cos-
mological redshift (z ∼ 0.09 for GW150914). As an order of
magnitude estimate, a radiation pulse emitted when the pair
plasma at Γ ∼ 100 reaches transparency can easily produce
a pulse 0.4 sec delayed from GW150914 (Kumar & Zhang
2015).
By assuming that the magnetic ﬁeld B0 upstream of
the reconnecting current sheet inﬂows at speed ∼ c in
the late merging phase near the horizon (r (cid:39) 2GM/c2),
one can equate B2
0 cr2/8π to the GBM transient luminos-
ity (L (cid:39) 1049 erg/s); the resulting magnetic ﬁeld of order
1012 − 1013 gauss is not unusual for magnetars although it
rules out magnetic ﬁeld sustained by an accretion disk in a
conﬁguration ´a la Blanford & Znajek (1977) .

√
GM is not rele-
vant as long as the merging magnetospheres can be sustained
during the coalescence process. Also, we did not discuss here
the process leading to the formation of the collapsing rotat-
ing stars. Before the detection of GW150914, binary BHs
were not deemed to exist in reality: models of gravitational
collapse of massive stars in an already formed binary sys-
tem and model of coalescence of two BHs moving one with
respect to the other with a suﬃciently small impact param-
eter have both unresolved issues. We have used here mag-
netosphere of a Kerr-Newman BH for an object close to the
ﬁnal stage of its gravitational collapse.

In this treatment the value of the Q/

It is expected that in the local Lorentz frame where the
reconnecting magnetic ﬁeld lines come close to each other,
the current sheet layer is dragged along the orbital motion
of the compact objects and stretched by diﬀerential rota-
tion, developing strong shear instabilities (see Corvino et al.
(2010) for the shear instability for an isolated neutron star).
Those instabilities will presumably grow faster and faster as
the system merge.

A noteworthy caveat on the scenario here proposed is
that the current modelling of turbulent magnetic reconnec-
tion is still under development. Moreover, in situ solar wind
measurements (Gosling et al. 2005) did not conﬁrm that ﬁeld
dissipation eﬃciently transfers magnetic energy to a non-
thermal particle population in non-relativistic ﬂows. How-
ever, several recent numerical experiments seemingly sup-
