INTRODUCTION

II. MOTIVATION: INDIVIDUAL RYDBERG

ATOMS FOR QUANTUM STATE ENGINEERING

Rydberg atoms [1] are highly excited atoms, where a
valence electron has a large principal quantum number
n (cid:29) 1. They have exaggerated properties, and in par-
ticular they interact very strongly with each other via
the dipole-dipole interaction. This is the basis for the
Rydberg blockade, i.e. the inhibition of the excitation of
ground-state atoms to the Rydberg state by the presence
of a nearby Rydberg atom.

Early theoretical proposals [2, 3] suggesting to use the
blockade to create entangled states of neutral atoms and
quantum gates triggered a lot of experimental activity,
over the last decade, to observe the blockade in ensembles
of laser-cooled atoms [4]. The ﬁeld is now evolving along
many directions, from quantum optics, with the promise
to realize single-photon nonlinearities [5], to many-body
physics in large ensembles [6]. This paper reviews recent
experimental work on the Rydberg blockade and its ap-
plication to the entanglement of two atoms as well as on
the measurement of interactions between Rydberg atoms.
We focus on small, well controlled systems of a few in-
dividual atoms trapped in arrays of addressable optical
tweezers [7]. We will only brieﬂy mention recent works
based on individual atoms held in optical lattices that
use quantum gas microscopes [8].

This review is organized as follows. We ﬁrst recall the
motivation behind those studies, and in particular the
principles of the quantum gates based on the blockade
mechanism. Then, after a theoretical reminder about
interactions between Rydberg atoms, we introduce the
basic experimental techniques used to manipulate indi-
vidual Rydberg atoms. We then review experiments that
demonstrated the Rydberg blockade, quantum gates and
entanglement of two atoms, and the direct measurements
of the interactions between Rydberg atoms in various
regimes. Finally, we discuss the current eﬀorts aiming
at extending those studies to larger numbers of atoms.

A. Review of single-particle Rydberg physics

We ﬁrst brieﬂy recall some basic properties of Ryd-
berg states and their scaling with the principal quantum
number n (see Table I). A comprehensive review of single-
particle physics of Rydberg states can be found in [1];
short overviews are available in [6, 9]. As all the ex-
periments using individual atoms performed to date use
rubidium or cesium, our discussion is restricted to alkali
atoms.
Rydberg atoms are in states with a principal quantum
number n (cid:29) 1. This corresponds classically to a very
large electron orbit, and the eﬀect of the nucleus and
remaining electrons (the ionic core) is essentially that of
an elementary positive point charge: thus the properties
of Rydberg atoms are very close to the ones of hydrogen.
In particular, the energy of a state |n, l, j, mj(cid:105) is given by

En,l,j =

−Ry

(n − δlj)2

(1)

where Ry (cid:39) 13.6 eV is the Rydberg constant, and the
quantum defects δlj are species-dependent corrections ac-
counting for the eﬀects of the ﬁnite size of the ionic core
(for heavy alkali atoms, δl≥3 ≈ 0).
The typical size of the electronic wavefunction for a
state |n, l, j, mj(cid:105) is on the order n2a0, where a0 is the
Bohr radius. This size reaches hundreds of nanometers
for the values of n used in experiments (typically from
n ∼ 20 to 100), and is at the origin of the exagger-
ated properties of Rydberg states: the electric dipole ma-
trix element between two neighboring states scales as n2,
while the energy spacing between adjacent Rydberg lev-
els, which scales as n−3, corresponds to millimeter-wave
transitions. This gives the Rydberg atoms a long lifetime
τ ∼ n3, and a very strong sensitivity to electric ﬁelds: the
polarizability scales as n7. This means that two nearby
Rydberg atoms undergo very strong dipole-dipole inter-
actions, that can reach tens of MHz for separations of
several microns between the atoms.

Eﬀects of Rydberg-Rydberg interactions were experi-
mentally observed in 1981 [10], at a time when Rydberg

atoms were used as a test bed for the study of atom-
light interactions [11]. The interest in interacting Ryd-
berg atoms got renewed at the end of the nineties, due to
the novel possibilities oﬀered by the availability of laser-
cooled samples in which the atomic motion is negligi-
ble on relevant experimental timescales, thus realizing a
‘frozen Rydberg gas’ [12, 13]. These pioneering studies
motivated theoretical proposals [2, 3] suggesting to use
the Rydberg blockade for quantum information process-
ing [14].

B. Early proposals: Rydberg blockade and

quantum gates

The principle underlying the Rydberg blockade is
shown in Figure 1. Consider the ground state |g(cid:105) of an
atom coupled to a Rydberg state |r(cid:105) with a resonant laser
with a Rabi frequency Ω. In the case of two atoms, the
collective ground state |gg(cid:105) is still resonantly coupled to
the states |gr(cid:105) and |rg(cid:105) containing a single Rydberg exci-
tation. However, the doubly-excited state |rr(cid:105) is shifted
out of resonance by the strong van der Waals interaction
UvdW between the two atoms. In the limit UvdW (cid:29) Ω,
i.e. for a small enough distance between the atoms, the
double excitation is thus energetically forbidden: this is

The Rydberg blockade was proposed in [2] as a means
of implementing fast quantum gates with neutral atoms.
The principle is shown in Fig. 2. The qubits are encoded
in two long-lived hyperﬁne levels |0(cid:105) and |1(cid:105) of the ground
state of each atom, which can be separately addressed
by lasers that couple state |1(cid:105) to the Rydberg state |r(cid:105)
(Fig. 2a). The two atoms are close enough so that Ry-
dberg blockade prevents the excitation of |rr(cid:105). When
applying the pulse sequence shown in Fig. 2b, if any of
the qubit is initially prepared in |1(cid:105), then the blockade

the atoms undergoes a 2π rotation, and the wavefunction
of the system gets a minus sign at the end of the sequence.
If both qubits are initially in |0(cid:105), the laser pulses have no
eﬀect. This leads to the truth table shown in Fig. 2c,
which implements a controlled-phase gate (that can be
turned into a CNOT gate using additional single-qubit
gates). One appealing feature of the Rydberg gates lies
in its short duration, set by the interaction energy of the
two atoms: as it can be as large as 10 MHz, the gate can
operate on a sub-microsecond time scale. This is in con-
trast with entangling operations using e.g. much weaker
ground-state interaction [15], which operate on a much
longer time. Another strong other asset of this protocol
is that it is largely insensitive to the exact value of the
interatomic interaction.

Further theoretical studies proposed to use the Ry-
dberg blockade in atomic ensembles [3, 16] in order to
generate non-classical states of light, or encode collec-
tive qubits. These early proposals were then followed
by detailed theoretical analyses of the various sources of
possible experimental imperfections [14, 17], that showed
promising prospects for the realization of high-ﬁdelity
gates. After the ﬁrst demonstration of the blockade be-
tween two atoms (see Sec.V), new schemes where pro-
posed for quantum gates [18, 19], including a generalized
CNOT gate where one atom controls the state of many
others [20], or for the preparation of multi-partite entan-
gled states [21].

C. Quantum simulation

Building a useful, general-purpose quantum computer
is to date an extremely challenging task, due to the very
large number of qubits and high-ﬁdelity gates that are
required [22]. A seemingly more realistic goal is to re-
alize quantum simulators [23, 24], in particular analog
ones, i.e. well-controlled quantum systems that can be
used to realize physically, in the laboratory, a complex,
many-body Hamiltonian of interest in other ﬁelds, e.g. in
condensed-matter physics [25]. Interesting properties of
the Hamiltonian, that are in practice impossible to ob-
tain from theoretical or numerical studies, can then be
directly measured in the simulated system.

INTERACTION BETWEEN RYDBERG

ATOMS

In this section, we brieﬂy describe various regimes of
interactions between two Rydberg atoms. We restrict
ourselves to a perturbative approach, and only outline
the main features of the problem for the simple case of
alkali atoms. For details about actual numerical calcula-
tions, we refer for instance to [27].

A. Perturbation of pair states by the dipole-dipole

interactions

We consider two atoms, labeled 1 and 2, located at po-
sitions R1 and R2, and we denote by R = R2 − R1 their
separation. When R ≡ |R| is much larger than the size
of the electronic wavefunction, the interaction Hamilto-
nian is obtained by the multipolar expansion, and the
dominant term is the dipole-dipole interaction

with n = R/R, and di the electric dipole operator of
atom i.
Let us denote by |α(cid:105),|β(cid:105), . . . the eigenstates of a sin-
gle atom, with corresponding eigenenergies Eα, Eβ, . . .
(α summarizes the quantum numbers n, l, j, mj). In the
absence of interaction, the eigenstates of the two-atom
system are the pair states |αβ(cid:105) ≡ |α(cid:105) ⊗ |β(cid:105) with energies
Eαβ = Eα + Eβ. Our goal is to calculate the eﬀect of the
perturbation (3) on these pair states; depending on the
situation, three regimes can be obtained (see Figure 3).

B. Van der Waals regime

Rydberg atoms are attractive candidates for the re-
alization of quantum simulators [26].
In particular, as
we shall see in the next section, the interactions between
Rydberg atoms naturally implement analog simulations
of various types of spin Hamiltonians, such as the Ising
model or the XY model, where the spin states are en-
coded in diﬀerent atomic levels.

We ﬁrst assume that the two atoms are prepared in

the same state |α(cid:105).
not degenerate with any other pair state (Figure 3a), the
typical splittings being several GHz. We thus use non-
degenerate perturbation theory. To ﬁrst order, there is no
energy shift, as the average value of Vddi in |αα(cid:105) vanishes
due to the fact that di is an odd-parity operator and that

the atomic states |α(cid:105) have deﬁnite parity. The energy
shift is thus given by second-order perturbation theory

(4)

where the sum extends to all states that are dipole-
coupled to |α(cid:105). Being second-order in Vddi, the shift
scales as 1/R6 and is simply the van der Waals interac-
tion. As the numerator in (4) is proportional to a dipole
moment to the fourth power, it scales as n8; the denomi-
nator, being a diﬀerence in energy between adjacent pair
states, scales as 1/n3. The C6 coeﬃcient thus increases
dramatically with n, as n11.

For a system of N > 2 atoms, the eﬀects of van der
Waals interactions are pairwise additive (except in ex-
ceptional cases, in particular when one considers the van
der Waals interaction between e.g. diﬀerent states of the
same parity [28]). Therefore, the interaction Hamiltonian
for N atoms reads

HvdW =

C6
R6
ij

ninj

(5)

where ni = |r(cid:105)(cid:104)r|i is the projector on the Rydberg state
of interest of atom number i. If one introduces pseudo-
spin 1/2 states |↓(cid:105) = |g(cid:105), where |g(cid:105) is the atomic ground
state, and | ↑(cid:105) = |r(cid:105), along with the corresponding spin
operators σx,y,z, one can write ni = (1+σi
z)/2. When one
adds a coherent laser driving on the transition |g(cid:105) ↔ |r(cid:105)
with a Rabi frequency Ω and a detuning δ, the total
Hamiltonian (in the rotating frame of the laser) is:

tonians, (6) describes an Ising quantum magnet with a
transverse ﬁeld ∝ Ω, a longitudinal ﬁeld ∝ δ + Bi, and
a spin-spin coupling decaying as 1/R6 with the distance
R between the spins.

For Rydberg states with an orbital angular momen-
tum L, each atom has 2J + 1 degenerate (or almost de-
generate in the presence of a moderate magnetic ﬁeld)
Zeeman sublevels (here, J = L ± 1/2 is the total angu-
lar momentum). This means that instead of having to
consider a single isolated pair state |αα(cid:105), one has to deal
with a manifold of (2J + 1)2 states. They are not di-
rectly coupled with each other by (3), but second-order
perturbation theory gives an eﬀective Hamiltonian that
acts within the manifold, with a global 1/R6 scaling and
couplings that depend on the angle θ between the quan-
tization axis and the internuclear axis. In the blockade
regime, it is possible to deﬁne an eﬀective van der Waals
shift, given by a suitably weighted average of the eigen-
values of the eﬀective Hamiltonian [29]. This allows one
to keep a simple (but approximate) two-level description
of each atom, keeping the size of the Hilbert space equal
to 2N for N atoms [30]. The validity of such approxima-
tions will depend on the exact experimental settings.

C. F¨orster resonance: tuning the interaction with

an electric ﬁeld

For some values of n, the pair state |αα(cid:105) can be
degenerate or quasi-degenerate with another pair state
|βγ(cid:105) with which it is coupled by the dipole-dipole in-
In this case, one neglects the

other, non-resonant couplings, keeping two coupled de-
√
generate states. Then the eigenstates in the presence of
Vddi are |±(cid:105) = (|αα(cid:105) ± |βγ(cid:105)) /
2, and the eigenergies
E± = ±C3/R3, where C3 = R3(cid:104)βγ|Vddi|αα(cid:105). The in-
teraction is now resonant and scales as 1/R3 [1]. Such
resonances have been called F¨orster resonances [31, 32],
due to the analogy with the F¨orster resonance energy
transfer [33, 34] at work in photochemistry.
Such degeneracies of pair states are in general only
approximate, with a diﬀerence in energy ∆ = Eαα −
Eβγ (called the F¨orster defect) between the two quasi-
degenerate pair states of a few or a few tens of MHz.
However, |α(cid:105), |β(cid:105) and |γ(cid:105) have in general diﬀerent polar-
izabilities, making it possible, by applying moderate elec-
tric ﬁelds, to Stark-tune the relative positions of |αα(cid:105) and
|βγ(cid:105) in order to get to exact resonance. Experimentally,
this allows one to switch, on fast timescales and almost at
will, between (strong) resonant and (weak) non-resonant
(van der Waals) interactions between the atoms.

Due to the Zeeman substructure of the involved Ryd-
berg levels, there are in general several resonances be-
tween diﬀerent channels corresponding to the various
possible combinations of the mj values. They occur at
slightly diﬀerent values of the electric ﬁeld, and that have
a diﬀerent angular dependence due to the anisotropy of
the dipolar interaction [35–37].

For a ﬁxed, non-zero F¨orster defect, one observes a
transition between the F¨orster regime at short distances,
and the van der Waals regime at large distances. The
crossover between the two regimes occurs at a distance
Rc ∼ (C3/∆)1/3. Away from quasi-degeneracies, Rc
scales as n7/3 with the principal quantum number n.

D. Resonant dipole-dipole interactions:

“spin-exchange” Hamiltonian

Another possibility to observe resonant dipole-dipole
interactions is to use two distinct, dipole-coupled Ryd-
berg states, by preparing the pair in |αβ(cid:105), where for in-
stance α is a nS Rydberg state, and β a n(cid:48)P state (with
n (cid:39) n(cid:48)). The pair state |αβ(cid:105) being degenerate with |βα(cid:105),
and the dipole-dipole Hamiltonian (3) coupling these two
states, Vddi reduces to (in the basis {|αβ(cid:105),|βα(cid:105)}):

Vddi =

C3

R3 (|αβ(cid:105)(cid:104)βα| + |βα(cid:105)(cid:104)αβ|) ,

(7)

where the coeﬃcient C3 is the product of two matrix
elements of the dipole operator between |α(cid:105) and |β(cid:105) and
therefore scales as n4.

5

action (3) is then diagonalized numerically (typically a
few hundreds or a few thousands states are retained).
Figure 4a shows a typical result of such a calculation,
showing that at distances of a few micrometers, many
molecular states, with an energy varying very rapidly
with the distance R, cross the line ∆E = 0 corresponding
to non-interacting atoms. This might give the impression
that blockade breaks down at short distances. However
these states actually are very weakly laser-coupled to the
ground state (see Fig. 4b), which preserves the quality of
the blockade (see also [43]).

IV. EXPERIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS:

TRAPPING AND RYDBERG EXCITATION OF

INDIVIDUAL ATOMS

In this section we describe the main experimental tools
used in recent experiments where arrays of single Ry-
dberg atoms are exploited for quantum simulation and
quantum information processing applications. Most ex-
periments so far were performed by the University of
Wisconsin (USA) group, the Sandia National Laboratory
group (Albuquerque, USA), and the Institut d’Optique
group (Palaiseau, France) using similar methods. We
summarize here these experimental techniques for the
preparation, detection, and manipulation of individual
Rydberg atoms.

A. Trapping individual atoms in “optical tweezers”

Neutral atoms can be conﬁned in space by the con-
servative potential of a far-oﬀ resonance optical dipole
trap [45]. An optical dipole trap is formed by focusing a
laser beam tuned far away from the atomic resonance fre-
quency. Red-detuned light induces an electric dipole mo-
ment in the atoms and exerts a force towards regions of
maximal intensity. This creates eﬀective potentials with
typical depths U/kB ≈ 0.1 − 1 mK. To load the atoms
in the traps a standard method is to pre-cool the atoms
in a Magneto Optical Trap (MOT). Loading is achieved
by spatially overlapping the dipole trap with the atomic
reservoir created by the MOT, leading to mesoscopic en-
sembles of atoms with temperature ∼ 10 µK.

Single atom trapping needs further requirements, and
diﬀerent approaches have been followed. One possibility
is to prepare an exactly known number of atoms (1-30)
in the MOT by setting its parameters to the limits (e.g.
using a large magnetic ﬁeld gradient) [46], before trans-
ferring the atoms to the dipole trap [47]. This technique
has been successfully applied to the generation of arrays
of single atoms in one dimensional optical lattices [48].

A second possibility is to use a high numerical aper-
ture optical system, such as custom-made objectives [49]
or aspherical lens [50], to reduce the volume of the dipole
trap to a size of ∼ 1 µm3. This conﬁguration of a tightly
In
focused dipole trap is named “optical tweezers”.

interaction (and of electric and magnetic ﬁelds) obtained by
numerical diagonalization. (a) Full plot of the spectrum. (b)
Same as (a) but with the darkness of the lines weighted by the
oscillator strength to the ground state. Figure taken from [44].

From the point of view of quantum simulation, if one
encodes pseudo-spin states |↑(cid:105),|↓(cid:105) in |α(cid:105),|β(cid:105), the resonant
dipole-dipole interaction directly implements the XY spin

with spin couplings decaying as 1/R3. Here, σ± =
σx ± iσy. Such long-ranged spin Hamiltonians have been
predicted to display anomalous properties as compared
to their short-range counterparts [38, 39], making them
attractive from the point of view of quantum simulation,
and have been the subject of experimental studies using
ultracold polar molecules pinned in optical lattices [40]
or dipolar Bose–Einstein condensates [41].

E. Beyond perturbation theory: numerical

diagonalization of the Hamiltonian

The discussions above give simple expressions for the
eﬀects of interactions on a pair of atoms. However, for
accurate comparison with experiments, it is necessary to
resort to a full numerical calculation of the energy spec-
trum of the pair, as the large number of closely-spaced
Rydberg states for large n leads to deviations from the
simple van der Waals interaction even for shifts as small
as a few tens of MHz. For this purpose, one needs to
evaluate numerically the (radial) dipole matrix elements
between diﬀerent Rydberg wavefunctions, and thus, the
wavefunctions themselves. This can be accomplished by
solving the radial Schr¨odinger equation using the Nu-
merov method [42]. The (truncated) Hamiltonian com-
prising the single-atom part and the dipole-dipole inter-

ﬁnd a conﬁguration where N tweezers are ﬁlled at the
same time decreases like pN . This triggered investiga-
tions on how to improve the loading eﬃciency of opti-
cal tweezers. Two methods have been demonstrated so
far. The ﬁrst one, proposed and demonstrated by the
Wisconsin group [16, 53], uses the Rydberg blockade in
a small atomic ensemble trapped in a tight dipole trap
and achieved a ﬁlling probability p (cid:39) 0.62. The second
method demonstrated in Otago [54–56] and at JILA [57]
relies on a tailoring of the light-assisted collisions in the
tweezers, and led to loading probabilities p ∼ 0.90.

B. Arrays of microtraps

Once demonstrated the trapping of individual atoms
in a trap, the next step in view of (scalable) quantum
engineering applications is to create controlled arrays of
such traps, each of them containing an individual atom.
A ﬁrst, natural approach consists in using optical lat-
tices, i.e. periodic optical dipole potentials obtained by
interfering several laser beams. One can use large-period
optical lattices (with a lattice spacing on the order of
a few microns, obtained by using interfering beams that
make a small angle with each other), and load in a sparse
way single atoms in the resulting array of microtraps [58].
Single-site imaging is relatively easy for such large-period
lattices, and coherent single-site manipulations of indi-
vidual atoms in such settings can also be achieved, even
in 3D settings [59]. Another approach consists in us-
ing usual, short-period (∼ 500 nm) optical lattices, and
loading ultracold atoms in a single 2D plane. There,
single-site resolution requires the use of advanced high
numerical aperture objectives, realizing a so-called quan-
tum gas microscope [60, 61]. One of the assets of such
an approach, despite its high technical complexity, is the
possibility to use a Mott insulator to achieve single-atom
ﬁlling with probabilities in excess of 90% per site. Single-
atom addressing, using techniques developed in the con-
text of 3D optical lattices [62, 63], can also be achieved
in those settings [64]. A drawback of this latter approach
is that for a large variety of Rydberg experiments, small

FIG. 5: Loading and imaging single atoms in a dipole trap.
(a) Atoms initially trapped in a MOT are loaded in a dipole
trap formed by focusing a red-detuned laser beam with a
high numerical aperture aspheric lens (NA = 0.5) under vac-
uum [50]. The ﬂuorescence of the atoms is separated from
the dipole trap light with a dichroic mirror and imaged on
an EMCCD camera. (b) Single-atom ﬂuorescence signal with

such a small trap, the dynamics of the atoms is gov-
erned by fast inelastic light-assisted collisions (with rates
of ∼ 104µm3s−1) induced by the near-resonant MOT
light [51], and is dominated by two-body losses [7, 52].
As a consequence, there exists a regime of densities of the
cold-atom cloud where the loading is sub-Poissonian and
at most one atom is trapped at a time. In this regime a
ﬁrst atom of the cloud enters the tweezers and is slowed
down thanks to the cooling lasers. When a second atom
enters the tweezers, a two-body inelastic collision cat-
alyzed by the light results in the rapid loss of the two
atoms.

The conﬁguration using a tight dipole trap presents
the advantage of being easily combined with an imag-
ing system with micrometer resolution, as represented in
Fig 5a. In this way, a real-time imaging system can be
used to record the ﬂuorescence of the atoms when they
are illuminated with near-resonant laser light (Fig. 5b):
the ﬂuorescence signal toggles at random between peri-
ods of low values corresponding to an empty trap, and
periods of high value reﬂecting the presence of an atom.
It is thus possible to determine exactly when an atom
has entered the trap and use this information to trigger
single-atom experiments with typically < 1 s duty cycle.
Table II gives typical parameters for an individual atom
trapped in an optical tweezers.

This method to prepare individual atoms is therefore
non-deterministic, with a ﬁlling probability of one tweez-
ers of p ∼ 0.5. This makes its extension to large arrays
of tweezers (see Sec. IV B) diﬃcult: the probability to

the obtained arrays is however more constrained than in
the case of arrays of red-detuned optical tweezers.

C. Laser excitation to Rydberg states

For alkali atoms, optical transitions between a given
ground-state and Rydberg states with principal quantum
numbers n = 40 − 200 lie in the UV domain, with wave-
lengths in the range 230− 320 nm. Direct, coherent opti-
cal excitation with CW lasers has recently been demon-
strated for single cesium atoms [44], requiring a power-
ful UV laser. The Rabi oscillations between the states
|6S1/2, F = 4, mF = 4(cid:105) (prepared by optical pumping)
and |84P3/2, mj = 3/2(cid:105) had a frequency ∼ 1 MHz. Note
that single-photon transitions do not allow to cancel the
Doppler eﬀect, and that, due to electric dipole selection
rules (∆L = ±1), such schemes limit Rydberg excitation
to P-states.

Most of the experiments using individual alkali atoms
rely instead on two-photon transitions. In rubidium, the
most frequently used scheme is the combination of 795
(780) nm and 474 (480) nm photons oﬀ-resonant from
the intermediate state 5P1/2 (5P3/2) [9, 73–75]. The “in-
verted” scheme 5S − 6P − nS/nD with 420 and 1016
nm light is also possible, but has not been used so far
with individual rubidium atoms. This inverted scheme
(6S − 7P − nS/nD) was implemented with individual
cesium atoms combining 459 and 1038 nm lasers [76].
In the limit of a large detuning ∆ with respect to the
intermediate state, ∆ (cid:29) ΩR, ΩB (with ΩR, ΩB the red
and blue Rabi frequencies, respectively), the three-level
system shown in Fig. 7a can be reduced to an equivalent
two-level system, where the ground state |g(cid:105) couples to
the Rydberg state |r(cid:105) with an eﬀective Rabi frequency
Ωeﬀ and an eﬀective detuning δeﬀ given by:

(cid:18)|ΩR|2

Ωeﬀ =

and δeﬀ = δ −

If this condition does not hold, spontaneous emission
via the intermediate state is not negligible on the exci-
tation timescale and leads to a loss of coherence in the
excitation. The spontaneous scattering rate Γeﬀ can be
estimated perturbatively from the average population in
the intermediate state and its decay rate Γ as:

In addition to a low scattering rate, coherent coupling
between the ground state and the Rydberg state requires
eﬀective Rabi frequencies higher than the linewidth of
the Rydberg state (e.g. ∼ 2π × 1.5 kHz for 62D3/2 in
Rb), and suﬃciently narrow laser linewidths. As an ex-
ample, in the experiment at Institut d’Optique, typical
eﬀective Rabi frequencies Ωeﬀ ∼ 2π × 1 − 10 MHz can
be obtained with between 100 µW and 10 mW of laser

rescence images of single atoms trapped in microtrap arrays

lattice constants limit the range of coupling strengths
that one can use.

A second approach, which allows for more ﬂexible ge-
ometries, consists in optically creating several ‘copies’ of
an optical tweezers, thus realizing arrays of microtraps.
For this, one can use holographic methods [65, 66] (see
Fig. 6a), diﬀractive optics [67], or microfabricated opti-
cal elements [68]. Holographic optical tweezers oﬀer a
versatile solution regarding accessible geometries. Us-
ing a programmable spatial light modulator to imprint
an arbitrary phase on a beam prior focusing, it is pos-
sible to replicate a single optical tweezers into hundreds
of traps in arbitrary geometries [65, 66]. Fast, single-
site addressing can be achieved by adding an extra beam
controlled by acousto-optic deﬂectors to add light-shifts
on targeted sites [69]. The number of traps can be mas-
sively increased, at the expense of some ﬂexibility on ge-
ometry, by making use of microfabrication techniques,
as pioneered by the group of G. Birkl [68]. More than
104 high numerical aperture micro lenses can be ﬁtted
on an area of 1 mm2, while allowing for micrometer size
traps [70].

For experiments that rely on Rydberg excitation, how-
ever, red-detuned traps have some limitations. The trap-
ping light reduces the lifetime of the Rydberg stated via
photoionization, and produces position-dependent diﬀer-
ential light shifts between ground and Rydberg states. To
avoid these problems, the traps are generally turned oﬀ
during Rydberg excitation, increasing atom losses. A so-
lution to this problem has been investigated by Saﬀman
and coworkers [71, 72]. They showed that for certain Ry-
dberg states, it is possible to ﬁnd trap wavelengths (called
quasimagic wavelengths) for which the ground and ex-
cited states are shifted by the same amount. For alkali
atoms, it implies the need for blue-detuned light, which
they use to create 2D arrays of dark traps by weakly over-
lapping Gaussian beams (see Fig. 6b). The geometry of

(a)(b)8

are reduced by grounding most of the surfaces surround-
ing the atoms. This includes the aspheric lenses used to
focus the tweezers beam at Institut d’Optique and by the
Sandia National Laboratory group, located ∼ 2− 10 mm
away from the plane of the atoms, that are coated with
a 200 nm thin layer of indium tin oxide (ITO)3. The In-
stitut d’Optique team also cancels actively any residual
DC ﬁeld in three directions by a set of eight electrodes in
an octopole conﬁguration that can be addressed indepen-
dently [9]. The ﬁeld plates are also used to apply ﬁnely
controlled pulsed ﬁelds, to Stark-tune the Rydberg state
energies. This allows, for example, switching on dipole-
dipole interactions between the atoms at a F¨orster res-
onance, by matching the resonance condition in a given
time window, as will be shown in Section VI B.

states in Rb used at Institut d’Optique. A π polarized 795 nm

power at 795 nm (focused to a beam waist of 120 µm) and
∼ 100 mW at 474 nm (for a beam waist of 20 µm). Both
excitation lasers are frequency locked to an ultra-stable,
high-ﬁnesse ULE cavity (F > 20000), providing overall
laser linewidths < 10 kHz. With this setup we routinely
obtain Rabi oscillations with small damping rates and
visibilities exceeding 90% (see Fig. 7b). Using similar
techniques, comparable Rabi frequencies and visibilities
are obtained by the Wisconsin group, either using cesium
or rubidium (see also the work at Chofu university [75]).

D. Electric ﬁelds

The huge polarizability α ∝ n7 of Rydberg atoms, aris-
ing from their large transition dipole moments, makes
them very sensitive to electric ﬁelds. For the Rydberg
states of alkali atoms accessible by laser excitation from
the ground state, the angular momentum is low (l (cid:46) 3)
and, as a consequence of the quantum defects, the Stark
eﬀect is quadratic in low electric ﬁelds. As an exam-
ple,
for a rubidium atom, a residual electric ﬁeld of
∼ 150mV/cm is enough to shift the |59D3/2, MJ = 3/2(cid:105)
state by 4.5 MHz. It is therefore important to accurately
control the electrostatic environment of the atoms to pre-
vent unwanted shifts. In experiments stray electric ﬁelds

E. Microwave manipulation in the Rydberg

manifold

Rydberg states are coupled to other Rydberg states
by electric dipole transitions in the microwave (MW) do-
main. Due to the dipole moment between nearby states
scaling as n2, even a small amount of microwave power
is enough to drive the transition with a high Rabi fre-
quency. This feature has established Rydberg atoms as
very sensitive probes with subwavelenth resolution that
can be potentially used as calibration standards in MW-
imaging [77, 78], and it is also a very convenient tool for
the manipulation of Rydberg states. From an optically
excited Rydberg state, other nearby Rydberg states can
be accessed with moderate MW power.

The Institut d’Optique group has demonstrated the
coherent coupling between the |62D3/2(cid:105) and |63P1/2(cid:105)
Rydberg states, as shown in Fig. 8 [79]. A 9.1 GHz
driving ﬁeld is applied with a 5 mm electric dipole an-
tenna placed outside the vacuum chamber, 20 cm away
from an atom trapped in a tweezers. The transition
dipole element between the two states, (cid:104)62D3/2, mj =
3/2| ˆd+|63P1/2, mj = 1/2(cid:105) (cid:39) 2858ea0, and ∼ 40µW of
microwave power are enough to drive Rabi oscillations at
a frequency of ΩMW = 2π×4.6 MHz. Well contrasted os-
cillations, with almost no damping over several microsec-
onds, are only observed if the underlying level structure
resembles a two-level system. To achieve this, we apply
a 6.6 G magnetic ﬁeld that lifts the Zeeman degeneracy
and ensures that only two levels are addressed with the
MW ﬁeld, even if its polarization at the position of the
atoms is not well controlled (Fig. 8).

3 However, as noted in [44], UV light can produce surface charging
of the ITO layer close to the atoms via the photoelectric eﬀect,
with detrimental eﬀects in the manipulation of Rydberg states.

(a)(b)   9

excitation to an nD state, the microwave pulse transfers
part of the population to a nearby n(cid:48)P state. The re-
maining fraction nD is mapped down to the ground state,
where its presence is inferred by a ﬂuorescence measure-
ment. An atom loss is now the signature of a transfer of
the atom to the nP state, which is not coupled back to
the ground state.

The obvious drawback of this method is that any un-
wanted loss (e.g. collisions with the background gas...)
mimics a Rydberg excitation. A way around this consists
in removing all ground state atoms with a resonant laser
pulse while the other atoms are in a Rydberg state, before
de-exciting the Rydberg atoms via stimulated emission
to the intermediate state and detecting the ﬂuorescence.
The Rydberg detection now relies on a positive detec-
tion. This method was implemented for atoms in optical
lattices [8], with a detection eﬃciency limited to ∼ 80%
so far.

V. DEMONSTRATION OF THE RYDBERG
BLOCKADE AND ENTANGLEMENT WITH

TWO ATOMS

The experimental eﬀort aiming at observing the Ry-
dberg blockade between two atoms started at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin shortly after the initial proposals.
It was backed by an in-depth theoretical analysis in
2005 [14]. The Institut d’Optique team started in 2008.
Both groups observed the blockade in 2008 and used it
to demonstrate in 2009 the entanglement of two atoms
(Institut d’Optique) and a CNOT gate (Wisconsin). The
group at Sandia National Laboratory joined the eﬀort a
few years later and was able to observe the blockade and
to entangle two atoms using a dressed Rydberg interac-
tion.

A. Rydberg blockade: the Wisconsin

experiment [82]

In this experiment, the group of M. Saﬀman at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin (USA) trapped two rubidium atoms
in two dipole traps separated by a distance of R ≈ 10 µm,
see ﬁgure 9(a). Here, each atom can be excited indepen-
dently, one atom being considered as the control atom,
the other one as the target atom. After preparing the
atoms in the hyperﬁne ground state |g(cid:105) = |5S1/2, F =
2, mF = 0(cid:105), the team ﬁrst excited the target atom to the
Rydberg state |r(cid:105) = |nD5/2, mj = 5/2(cid:105) (n = 79 or 90) us-
ing a two-photon transition. As they varied the duration
of the excitation, they observed the characteristic Rabi
oscillations between the states |g(cid:105) and |r(cid:105) (see Fig. 9b).
In order to demonstrate the blockade, the authors
started by exciting the control atom to the Rydberg state
by applying a π pulse. They then sent the excitation laser
on the target atom and observed that the probability to
excite it to the Rydberg state was strongly suppressed as

FIG. 8: (a) A microwave ﬁeld couples the 62D3/2 and 63P1/2
Rydberg states in Rb. The MW polarization is a combination
of σ+ and σ− polarizations at the position of the atoms. A 6.6
G magnetic ﬁeld shifts the Zeeman sub-levels so that only two
levels remain resonant with the MW ﬁeld. (b) Rabi oscillation
between the two Rydberg states. Figure adapted from [79].

F. Detection of Rydberg states

Positive detection of Rydberg states is generally ac-
complished via ﬁeld ionization and subsequent detection
of the electron/ions with over 90% eﬃciency [1, 9]. This
method has been traditionally used for Rydberg detec-
tion in cold atom clouds. For the separations of a few
microns attained in optical tweezers based setups, site-
selective detection via multichannel plates is challenging,
and would probably require the use of a tip imaging probe
close to the atoms [80].

Single-atom trapping in arrays of optical tweezers,
however, naturally provides another detection method
based on atom losses. The dipole trap laser operat-
ing around 850-950 nm induces a small positive light
shift of ∼ 1 MHz (for a 20 MHz trap depth for ground-
state atoms) for Rydberg states with principal quantum
numbers n > 50. Therefore, Rydberg atoms cannot be
trapped in the dipole traps, and due to their ﬁnite tem-
perature, they have ample time to escape the trapping
region within their lifetime. For typical experimental
parameters used by the Wisconsin, Sandia and Institut
d’Optique groups, the probability for a Rydberg atom to
remain in the trapping region after 50 µs is below 10%.
This detection method therefore maps an excitation to a
Rydberg state onto a loss of the atoms following the ex-
citation. As an example, the Institut d’Optique reported
an eﬃciency of this method of 97% [81], which means
that in only 3% of the cases the loss of atoms is not due
to excitation to a Rydberg state.

This detection technique can be made Rydberg-state-
dependent, allowing to discriminate between states with
diﬀerent parities. This was illustrated in [79], by combin-
ing microwave and optical excitation (see Fig. 8): after

FIG. 10: Observation of the blockade and of the collective ex-
citation of two atoms by the Institut d’Optique group. Here
the two traps are separated by 4 µm. The excitation lasers
do not address the atoms independently, as their size is much
larger than the interatomic distance. The atoms are excited
by a two-photon transition. Red disks: probability to excite
atom A alone when the trap B is empty. Black squares: prob-
ability to excite the two atoms. Blue squares: probability to

calculate the probabilities. Figure from [83].

√

ity of exciting the two atoms at the same time is indeed
suppressed, as it should be for two atoms in the block-
ade regime. However, the probability to excite one of the
two atoms does oscillate, and the oscillation frequency
is larger than when only one atom is present. The ra-
tio of the two measured Rabi frequencies is 1.38, in very
2 factor. This en-
good agreement with the expected
hancement of the oscillation frequency is the signature of
the collective excitation of the two atoms: in the block-
ade regime, the laser couples the two collective states |gg(cid:105)
√
and |ψ+(φ)(cid:105) = (|rg(cid:105)+eiφ|gr(cid:105))/
2. Here the phase factor
φ = (kR + kB) · (rA − rB) is imposed by the geometry
of the red and blue excitation lasers (wave vectors kR
and kB, respectively) and the positions rA, and rB of
the atoms. The positions of the atoms are ﬁxed during
a single realization of the experiment but vary from one
realization to another, leading to a shot-to-shot varia-
tion of the phase φ by more than 2π. Strictly speaking,
the experiment therefore produces a statistical mixture
of states |ψ+(φ)(cid:105).

C. Rydberg blockade: the Sandia experiment [44]

The team at Sandia National Laboratory used two ce-
sium atoms trapped in two tweezers separated by 6.6 µm.
The Rydberg excitation connects the hyperﬁne ground
state |g(cid:105) = |6S1/2, F = 4, mF = 0(cid:105) to the Rydberg state
|r(cid:105) = |84P3/2, mj = 3/2(cid:105) by a single step process at 319
nm. The laser does not address a speciﬁc atom and the
group observed the same signatures as in the Palaiseau
experiment: a suppression of the probability to excite the
two atoms at the same time and the
2 enhancement of

shown in ﬁgure 9(b). This is the signature of the Ryd-
berg blockade and the proof that the Rydberg excitation
of the target atom is controlled by the state of the con-
trol atom. Note that in this addressable version of the
Rydberg blockade, the atoms are not entangled at the
end of the sequence.

B. Rydberg blockade: the Palaiseau

experiment [83]

In the Institut d’Optique experiment, the two atoms
A and B were trapped in two dipole traps separated by
a distance of 4 µm. There, the Rydberg excitation laser
does not address a speciﬁc atom.

The group ﬁrst measured a Rabi oscillation with only
atom A present, the second trap being empty: it observed
the Rabi oscillations between state |g(cid:105) = |5S1/2, F =
2, mF = 2(cid:105) and |r(cid:105) = |58D3/2, mj = 3/2(cid:105), as shown by
the red disks in Fig. 10. The experiment is then repeated
when the two traps contain one atom each. The group
measured the probability Prr to excite the two atoms
(black squares) and the probability Prg + Pgr to excite
only one of the two atoms (blue squares). The probabil-

D. Demonstration of a CNOT gate and

entanglement between two atoms

The immediate step after the demonstration of the Ry-
dberg blockade for the three groups was the demonstra-
tion of entangling operations. The three groups followed
three diﬀerent approaches.
√
The Institut d’Optique group started from the collec-
tive state |ψ+(φ)(cid:105) = (|rg(cid:105) + eiφ|gr(cid:105))/
2 produced as a
consequence of the blockade and mapped the Rydberg
state |r(cid:105) to the hyperﬁne ground state |g(cid:48)(cid:105) = |5S1/2, F =
1, mF = 1(cid:105) using a second red laser close to 795 nm. In
doing so, the phase factor φ is erased [84], provided the
atoms do not move during the excitation and mapping
√
pulses. The ﬁnal state should then be close to the Bell
state |Ψ+(cid:105) = (|g(cid:48)g(cid:105) + |gg(cid:48)(cid:105))/
2. This state also presents
the advantage of being trapped in the tweezers and long-
lived. The team measured the ﬁdelity |(cid:104)Ψ+|Ψexp(cid:105)|2 of
the state prepared in the experiment |Ψexp(cid:105) by applying
a global rotation using Raman lasers coupling the two
states |g(cid:105) and |g(cid:48)(cid:105). They could extract two types of ﬁ-
delities. The ﬁrst one corresponds to the ﬁdelity with
which the state |Ψ+(cid:105) is prepared in the experiment, and
amounts to 0.46. However, there is a 61% probability
to lose at least one of the two atoms during the entan-
gling sequence, which leads to a ﬁdelity of the remaining
pairs of 0.75, larger than the 0.5 threshold to claim en-
tanglement [85]. A detailed analysis of the experiment
was performed in [86].

The Wisconsin group demonstrated a CNOT gate [87],
thanks to their ability to perform local addressing of each
atom. To do so, they used two types of sequences (involv-
ing respectively 5 and 7 pulses, see Fig. 11a) to imple-
ment a variant of the original proposal [2]. This two-bit
gate involves two hyperﬁne ground states of the rubid-
ium atom, labeled |0(cid:105) = |5S1/2, F = 1, mF = 0(cid:105) and
|1(cid:105) = |5S1/2, F = 2, mF = 0(cid:105), and the Rydberg state
|r(cid:105) = |97D5/2, mj = 5/2(cid:105) as an intermediate state in the
sequence. The Rydberg blockade is the underlying mech-
anism, which allows or not the ﬂipping of the state of the
target atom depending on the state of the control atom.
The Wisconsin group reported a ﬁdelity of the gate truth
table of 0.73 [87] (Fig. 11b).

They also used the gate to demonstrate the prepa-
ration of the four entangled Bell states.
Starting
√
from the control atom prepared in the superposition
(|0(cid:105) + |1(cid:105)) /
2, and the target state in |0(cid:105), the action
√
of the CNOT gate leads to the ﬁnal two-atom state
(|00(cid:105) + |11(cid:105)) /
2. The ﬁdelity of the entangled states
was reported to be around 0.48. As in the Palaiseau ex-
periment, atom losses during the sequence lead to a prob-
ability of having the two atoms at the end of the sequence
of 83%. The corrected ﬁdelity is therefore 0.58. A few
months later, the group reported an improved ﬁdelity of
0.58 of the entanglement without accounting for the loss

and 0.71 when correcting for the atom losses [88]. The
non-corrected loss is therefore already higher than the
threshold for entanglement at 0.5. Finally, the group re-
cently implemented the original proposal of [2] between
two next-nearest-neighbor cesium atoms trapped in an
√
array of 49 traps separated by 3.6 µm. The ﬁdelity of
preparation of the (|00(cid:105) + |11(cid:105))/
2 state is 0.73 includ-
ing the losses and 0.79 after correction [76].

E. Demonstration of two-atom entanglement using

a dressed Rydberg interaction [89]

The Sandia team also used the Rydberg blockade to
entangle two atoms. However they did it while keeping
the atoms in their hyperﬁne ground states, contrarily to
the Institut d’Optique experiment. The protocol uses a
Rydberg-dressed interaction proposed initially by I. Bou-
choule and K. Moelmer [90] in 2002, further expanded by
G. Pupillo and co-workers [91] in 2010. The principle of
the Rydberg-dressed interaction is the following [92]: a
laser couples the ground state |g(cid:105) to the Rydberg state
|r(cid:105), with a Rabi frequency Ω and a detuning ∆. This laser
admixes the two atomic states, giving to the ground state
a part of the Rydberg characteristics, therefore allowing
two atoms in the ground state to interact.

2,|11(cid:105)} is anharmonic (see
Figure 12a). A pair of Raman lasers (or a microwave
ﬁeld) tuned to the |0(cid:105) − |1(cid:105) transition cannot excite two
atoms initially in state |00(cid:105) to the state |11(cid:105). This is the
exact equivalent of the blockade experiment at Institut
d’Optique, but in the ground state manifold. The Sandia
group implemented this idea by using two moving traps,
each containing one cesium atom. They initially prepared
each atom in the state |0(cid:105) = |6S1/2, F = 4, mF = 0(cid:105),
while separated by a distance of 6.6 µm. Then, they
approach the two atoms at a distance of 3 µm to en-
hance their interaction, while applying a pair of Raman
beams to drive the |0(cid:105) − |1(cid:105) transition with the dress-
ing beam at 319 nm on at the same time. By scanning
the frequency of the Raman laser, they could measure
the dressed interaction energy (see Figure 12b). Work-
ing in the Rydberg blockade conﬁguration (Raman laser
tuned on resonance with the 0 − 1 transition) they could
observe the characteristic
2 enhancement of the Rabi
√
frequency (see Figure 12c) and generate the entangled
state (|01(cid:105) + |10(cid:105))/
2 with a ﬁdelity of 0.81. However,
there is still a 40% probability to lose at least one atom
during the sequence.

√

This experiment is the ﬁrst demonstration of Rydberg-
dressed interactions. Key to the success was the use of
a single-step excitation at 319 nm, which is not plagued
by the spontaneous emission from an intermediate level,
as is the case for two-photon excitation. The group also
analyzed a scheme for implementing a controlled-Z gate
using this approach [93].

F. Conclusion on the blockade and entanglement

experiments

In the early demonstrations at Wisconsin, Institut
d’Optique and Sandia, the quality of the blockade was
not perfect, usually featuring probabilities of double ex-
citation as high as 15-20%. This plagued the ﬁdelities
of the entangled states prepared and of the CNOT gate.
Detailed theoretical investigations of the measured ﬁdeli-
ties [76, 94] seem to indicate that the limitations are
mainly technical, and therefore could be overcome. This
triggered the construction of a new generation of dedi-
cated experimental setups, including in particular con-
trol of the electric ﬁelds. These experiments are starting
to produce results, and excellent blockade with double
excitation probabilities as low as a few percent has been
observed for two and three atoms (see Section VII). At
the moment, the quality of the blockade should not be the
main limitation in the ﬁdelity of entangling operations.

VI. MEASUREMENT OF THE INTERACTION
ENERGY BETWEEN TWO RYDBERG ATOMS

In this section, we review a set of experiments, per-
formed between 2013 and 2015 at Institut d’Optique, on

the measurement and control of the interaction between
two individual 87Rb atoms held at well-deﬁned positions,
in the three regimes introduced in Section III.

A. Van der Waals interaction [95]

The basic idea to measure directly the interaction en-
ergy as a function of the distance R between two atoms in
|r(cid:105) = |nD3/2(cid:105) consists in working in the partial blockade
regime, i.e. when Ω ∼ UvdW. In this case, the dynamics
of the system depends on both the Rabi frequency Ω and
the interaction UvdW, which allows one to determine the
latter.

The two atoms are initially prepared in the ground
state, and then illuminated by Rydberg excitation lasers
with Rabi frequency Ω for a time τ . Figure 13a shows the
dynamics of the population of the doubly excited state
|rr(cid:105) (with n = 62), for decreasing distances R between
the atoms. The top panel shows the almost not inter-
acting case at large R, where ideally Prr (cid:39) sin4(Ωτ /2)

a 4-level model with UvdW as the only adjustable parameter.

the Rydberg blockade is eﬀective and thus Prr (cid:39) 0. For
intermediate cases however, the dynamics is more in-
volved, Prr(τ ) showing a beating between incommensu-
rate frequencies that depend on both Ω and UvdW. The
solid lines are ﬁts to the solution of the optical Bloch
equations for the four-state system {|gg(cid:105),|gr(cid:105),|rg(cid:105),|rr(cid:105)},
where UvdW is left as an adjustable parameter.

Figure 13b shows the obtained interaction energies,
when the experiment is repeated for various distances
R, and then for diﬀerent principal quantum numbers n.
One observes the 1/R6 scaling of the van der Waals in-
teraction. The agreement with ab initio calculations of
the interaction (solid lines) is very good.

The same technique was subsequently used in [81] to
measure the angular dependence of the van der Waals
interaction between two nS1/2 or nD3/2 states (see Fig-
ure 17a,b). While in the ﬁrst case the interaction is
isotropic, the van der Waals interaction between D-states
shows a clear anisotropy, varying by a factor ∼ 3 when
the angle between the quantization axis and the internu-
clear axis varies from θ = 0 to θ = π/2.

B. F¨orster resonance [96]

avoided crossing by laser spectroscopy. (c) Oscillations in the

two pair states (Figure 14a,b). In a second step, we stud-
ied the interaction in the time domain, by preparing ﬁrst
the system in |dd(cid:105), and then switching abruptly (with a
risetime of about 10 ns) the electric ﬁeld to resonance,
for an adjustable time T . A ﬁnal optical readout pulse
then allowed to measure the probability for the pair of
atoms to be in |dd(cid:105), showing coherent oscillations be-
tween the two coupled pair states (Figure 14c). The fre-
quency of these oscillations scales as 1/R3 with the dis-
tance between the atoms. As compared to earlier studies
of F¨orster resonances in disordered ensembles comprising
a large number of atoms (see [6] and references therein),
this clean system consisting of only two atoms at con-
trolled positions makes it possible to study directly the
spatial dependence of the interaction and to observe its
coherent character.

In [96], we used our ability to apply arbitrary
electric ﬁelds with electrodes to tune the pair state
|dd(cid:105) = |59D3/2, 59D3/2(cid:105) on resonance with |pf(cid:105) =
|61P1/2, 57F5/2(cid:105). First, we performed a spectroscopic
measurement to determine the exact value of the elec-
tric ﬁeld giving rise to the avoided crossing between the

A subsequent experiment [37] measured the angular
dependence of the dipolar interaction at resonance, ob-
serving the characteristic variation 1 − 3 cos2 θ of the in-
teraction with the angle θ between the internuclear axis
and the quantization axis (see Fig. 17c).

between Rydberg atoms versus distance, in various regimes,
performed at Institut d’Optique. The atoms are separated
by a distance R, the internuclear axis being aligned with the
quantization axis. Disks are the measured values, and solid
lines the theoretical interaction without any adjustable pa-
rameter.

C. Resonant dipole-dipole interaction [79]

In order to observe the resonant dipole-dipole interac-
tion described in Section III D, a system of two atoms
separated by a distance R was prepared in the state |pd(cid:105),
where |p(cid:105) = |63P1/2, mj = 1/2(cid:105) and |d(cid:105) = |62D3/2, mj =
3/2(cid:105). This was achieved by (i) applying a light-shift on
atom 1, using an addressing beam [69], while using a
global, two-photon, resonant Rydberg excitation pulse
to bring atom 2 to |d(cid:105); (ii) applying a microwave pulse
at about 9.1 GHz (see section IV E) which brings atom
2 to |p(cid:105); and (iii) exciting atom 1 to |d(cid:105) with a resonant
laser pulse (atom 2, in |p(cid:105), is not aﬀected by the Rydberg
pulse).

The pair of atoms thus prepared in |pd(cid:105) is left to evolve
for an adjustable time T before the state of the system
is readout by sending a Rydberg pulse which de-excites
the |d(cid:105) state back to the ground state, while |p(cid:105) remains
unaﬀected. Figure 15a shows coherent oscillations of the
populations of the |pd(cid:105) and |dp(cid:105) states as a function of T .
The oscillation frequency varies as 1/R3 (Figure 15b), as
expected for this dipolar-induced excitation exchange.

Rydberg atoms. The internuclear axis and the quantization
axis are at an angle θ. The van der Waals interaction between
two atoms in |nD3/2(cid:105) shows a signiﬁcant anisotropy (a), while
it is isotropic for |nS1/2(cid:105) states (b). (c) At a F¨orster reso-
nance, the interaction shows the characteristic angular pat-

tern ∝ (cid:0)1 − 3 cos2 θ(cid:1) of the dipole-dipole interaction (solid

D. Conclusion on the measurement of interactions

between Rydberg states

VII. TOWARDS LARGER NUMBER OF ATOMS

This series of experiments allowed to explore in detail
the spatial dependence of the various types of interactions
between Rydberg atoms, both as a function of distance
(Fig. 16), and as a function of the angle (Fig. 17). The
very good agreement between theory experiments shows
that the experimental control of small systems of single
atoms excited to Rydberg states is good enough for such
studies to be extended to larger number of atoms, as we
shall describe in the next section.

The direct measurement and control of the interactions
between Rydberg atoms in electric and magnetic ﬁelds
shown above enables the quantum simulation of complex
synthetic quantum systems in arbitrary geometries. In-
deed, besides the demonstration of a CNOT gate between
two atoms in an array of micro traps mentioned in Sec-
tion V D [76], two groups recently performed experiments
where more than 2 atoms interact with each other. Both
engineer and simulate spin Hamiltonians, as described

in Section III. Beyond proof-of-principle demonstrations,
these experiments allowed capturing the main technical
imperfections and quantify their eﬀects on the spin dy-
namics.

A.

Ising dynamics in three-atom systems [81]

As a ﬁrst example, the Institut d’Optique group im-
plemented the Ising-like Hamiltonian (6) for a system of
three spins arranged in an equilateral triangle [81]. To
highlight the opportunities anisotropic interactions might
bring, the group excited the atoms to the |82D3/2, mj =
3/2(cid:105) Rydberg state. For atoms separated by 12 µm and
a driving Rabi frequency of 2π × 0.8 MHz, the van der
Waals blockade is only partial, as the atom pairs ex-
hibit eﬀective interaction energies (V12, V23, V13) = h ×
(0.9, 1.1, 2.6) MHz. The experiment started by initializ-
ing the system to the state |↓↓↓(cid:105). Then, applying the
excitation laser for a variable time, the ﬁnal spin state
was measured. The result is shown in Fig. 18b, where
the angular dependence of Veﬀ becomes apparent in the
dynamics.
The probability to excite the state |↑↓↑(cid:105) is almost to-
tally suppressed, while it is appreciable for both |↑↑↓(cid:105) and
|↓↑↑(cid:105), which show very similar dynamics. Increasing the
Rabi frequency to 2π × 1.6 MHz partially overcomes the
blockade of triple excitations, but the asymmetry in the
curves for double excitations due to anisotropic interac-
tions can still be observed. Solid lines represent the pre-
dicted dynamics of the two level system evolving under
the Hamiltonian (6), with no adjustable parameters. The
simulation includes the independently measured Rabi fre-
quencies and damping rates for single atom in each site.

FIG. 19: Coherent excitation hopping in a spin chain. Dy-
namics for a system initially prepared in the state |↑↓↓(cid:105) and
evolving under the Hamiltonian (8). The atom are sepa-
rated by 20 µm and aligned with the quantization axis. Disks
are experimental data points averaged over 100 realizations.
Curves represent the predicted dynamics taking into account
experimental imperfections, without any adjustable parame-
ter. Figure adapted from [79].

The small damping rates observed are mainly due to oﬀ-
resonant spontaneous emission through the intermediate
state |5P1/2(cid:105). In addition, the numerical results account
for the eﬀect of ∼ 5% atom losses in the populations. The
agreement is very good and demonstrates the promises
of cold Rydberg atoms to perform quantum simulations
of Ising Hamiltonians.

B. XY Hamiltonian dynamics in chain of

three-atoms [79]

In a second experiment, the Institut d’Optique group
used resonant dipole-dipole interactions to engineer the
XY Hamiltonian (8) for a chain of three Rydberg atoms
aligned along the quantization axis [79]. In this conﬁg-
uration, two diﬀerent pairwise interaction strengths are
at play. Owing to the 1/R3 scaling of the dipole-dipole
interaction, the coupling is 8 times as large for nearest
neighbors as for the two furthermost atoms. As a conse-
quence, when the system is initialized in the state |↑↓↓(cid:105),
the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are incommensurate
and the dynamics is expected to show aperiodic oscilla-
tions in the populations of |↑↓↓(cid:105) and |↓↓↑(cid:105).

This is qualitatively observed in the experimental data
shown in Fig. 19b, which exhibits collapse and revivals
in the dynamics due to the long-range coupling. There,
solid lines are the result of a numerical simulation of
the XY Hamiltonian (8), including ﬁnite preparation ﬁ-

(a)(b)   y   y16

In this experiment, the distance between the atoms is
a = 500 nm.

By shining the excitation laser on all the atoms at the
same time, the group demonstrated the Rydberg block-
ade in their system by observing spatially ordered struc-
tures (Fig. 20b) [8]. For this particular demonstration,
the fact that the atoms are arranged in a two-dimensional
periodic structure is irrelevant, as each blockade sphere
contains many atoms (Rb ∼ 10a). However, the high res-
olution microscope provides a spatial detection of the Ry-
dberg excitation, which is challenging to achieve in cold
atomic ensemble with random positions of the atoms [97].
The group also coherently manipulated a collective
state composed of up to 185 individual atoms, and con-
ﬁrmed the expected
N enhancement of the Rabi fre-
quency (Fig. 20c) [98]. Recently, the same group suc-
ceeded in the preparation of a state closed to a Rydberg
crystal with a precise number of excitations via adiabatic
sweeps of the laser parameters [99].

Systems of individually trapped and addressed Ryd-
berg atoms enter an exciting time. After the recent
demonstration of elementary building blocks, they should
provide in the coming years an ideal platform to study
many-body physics in the laboratory, with many possible
applications in quantum simulation and quantum infor-
mation processing.

delities, atom temperature eﬀects, and detection errors.
Here also, the agreement with the experimental data is
very good and shows that the system can be eﬀectively
reduced to a three-particle two-level model. Moreover,
since there are not fundamental limitations in sight to
reduce the eﬀect of imperfections, this result strengthens
the ambition to perform larger scale quantum simulations
with Rydberg atoms.

C. Blockade in optical lattices

Although not directly the focus of this review, we
brieﬂy mention a series of experiments involving Rydberg
atoms prepared in 2D optical lattices, that have been
performed in Munich since 2012. In these experiments,
which also implement the Ising-like Hamiltonian (6), sin-
gle atoms are trapped in 2D arrays of ∼ 10 × 10 sites
created by optical potentials, and imaged using a high
resolution microscope objective, as depicted in Fig. 20a.
