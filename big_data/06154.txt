Dipolaritons are quasiparticles that arise in coupled quantum wells embedded in a microcavity,
they are a superposition of a photon, a direct exciton and an indirect exciton. We propose the
existence of dipolaritons in a system of two coupled quantum dots inside a microcavity in direct
analogy with the quantum well case and ﬁnd that, despite some similarities, dipolaritons in quantum
dots have diﬀerent properties and can lead to true dark polariton states. We use a ﬁnite system
theory to study the eﬀects of the magnetic ﬁeld on the system, including the emission, and ﬁnd that
it can be used as a control parameter of the properties of excitons and dipolaritons, and the overall
magnetic behaviour of the structure.

INTRODUCTION

Microcavities with active media embedded in them are
structures of great interest in the development of quan-
tum computation and the study of fundamental physics,1
these devices are the solid-state implementation of the
Purcell eﬀect.2,3 Typical examples are quantum wells
(QWs) or quantum dots (QDs) in micropillars or pho-
tonic crystals.4–7 Exciton polaritons are quasiparticles
that arise in this kind of systems when a strong cou-
pling between matter excitations and cavity photons is
obtained.8,9 From their excitonic component, polaritons
are provided with strong non-linear interactions, and a
very small eﬀective mass is inherited from their photonic
contribution;10 these and other characteristics make po-
laritons quasiparticles of high interest in research, leading
to the development of the ﬁeld known as polaritonics.11–15
The usage of double QWs as active media inside a
microcavity leads to the formation of a new kind of
polaritons.16–19. The QWs are electrically tuned to al-
low the tunnelling of charge carriers and the subsequent
formation of bound electron-hole pairs with the charges
conﬁned in diﬀerent layers, known as indirect excitons
(IX). The latter do not interact with cavity photons (C)
but are electrically coupled with direct excitons (DX),
electron-hole pairs in the same QW. The three-way super-
position of DX, IX and C is a dipolariton, a polariton with
a large dipole moment due to its indirect exciton part.
Recently, dipolaritons in QW systems have been predicted
to be suitable for the observation of superradiant tera-
hertz (THz) emission and THz lasing,20–22 single-photon
emission,23,24 Bose-Einstein condensation,25,26 polariton
bistability,27 and the realization of high-ﬁdelity quantum
gates.28 Meanwhile, other research has focused on the
eﬀects of the pumping,29 and the electrical control of
strong coupling30 and spin interactions31.

An analogue system can be fabricated replacing the
QWs with QDs. As quantum dots are usually known
as artiﬁcial atoms, the coupling of 2 or more of them is
called a quantum dot molecule (QDM).32–34 Similarly to
the QW setup, an electric ﬁeld can be used to enhance the

two coupled QDs separated by a distance d, embedded in a
microcavity. The tunnelling rate Te and bias voltage Vb allows
the formation of IXs.

tunnelling coupling between dots and allow the formation
of IXs.35–38 Thus, in principle, it is possible to generate
dipolaritons in a QDM embedded in a microcavity (Fig.
1).
In this paper we explore this idea and study the
diﬀerences and similarities between QD dipolaritons and
their QW counterpart. Moreover, we include a constant
magnetic ﬁeld and propose it as a control channel of
the properties of the system. Our main ﬁndings include
the existence of true dark polariton states (despite the
controversy around this states in QWs),18,19,30 a scaling
law for the energy of the system and a change in the
magnetic response.

The paper is structured as follows. In Sec. II we intro-
duce the ﬁnite system hamiltonian used to describe the
system of interest. The study of the properties of excitons
in a QDM is presented in Sec. III. In Sec. IV we propose
the existence of dipolaritons in QDs and investigate their
properties under the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. Finally,
in Sec V, we present the extension to multiexcitonic QDs
using a variational method. Sec. VI includes a summary
and conclusions of the work.

II. SYSTEM AND HAMILTONIAN

The system consists of a microcavity that conﬁnes two
layers of vertically aligned InGaAs quantum dots, sepa-
rated by a distance d, in the presence of a constant mag-
netic ﬁeld B in the growth direction of the structure,39 as
shown in Fig. 1. The cavity is such that the energy levels
are spaced enough allowing us to consider a single light
mode. Only one QD is in strong coupling with the light

2

ﬁeld and the interaction is described upon dipolar and
rotating wave approximations. For simplicity, we consider
tunnelling between dots to be only of electrons, this is
usually done experimentally by including a bias voltage
Vb that tunes the conduction band levels and detunes the
valence bands.35,37 With the above considerations, one
dot conﬁnes both electrons and holes (labelled as 1) and
the other one conﬁnes electrons only (labelled as 2), such
that the hamiltonian can be written as:

strength Te. All the distances are in units of the magnetic

length lB =(cid:112)2c/eB.

Spin degrees of freedom are ignored by considering a
single polarization of light coupling with a speciﬁc spin
orientation of electrons and holes, and by neglecting ex-
change eﬀects. This argument is valid because tunnelling
is considered elastic and Coulomb interaction does not
change spin orientation.

III. EXCITONS IN A QDM

(cid:88)

n

To study the properties of excitons in QDMs we focus
on the system without light i.e., ω = g = 0 in Eq. (1).
InGaAs is a material with a direct band gap and, since
the tunnelling is elastic, the total angular momentum is
a conserved quantity.45 The number of excitons deﬁned
as:40,46,47

Nexc =

(3)

is another conserved quantity. Therefore, the hamiltonian
is diagonalized for a ﬁxed manifold, using a basis com-
posed of states constructed as products: |Se1(cid:105)|Se2(cid:105)|Sh(cid:105),
with zero total angular momentum and equal number of
electrons and holes.40,45,47 |S(cid:105) represents a Slater deter-
minant of single particle states of electrons in each dot
or holes. The lowest eigenvalue will represent the ground-
state energy and the corresponding linear combination of
states used for the diagonalization will be the ground-state
ket, similarly, the excited states are obtained.

It is important to notice that the Landau basis is inﬁnite
and must be truncated at a certain lmax and nmax. This
truncation is, in principle, due to computational reasons,
however, it is also natural for the system since states with
a large angular momentum and energy will overcome the
conﬁnement in the QD and leave.

The diagonalization of the hamiltonian was performed
using a basis constructed as explained above and com-
posed of 120 single particle (Landau) states, distributed
in 3 levels, i.e., nmax = 2. We focused on a single exciton
Nexc = 1, however, the extension to several electron-hole
pairs is straightforward. First, we ignore the tunnelling
and plot the energies of the DX and IX for several values
of magnetic ﬁeld, the results are depicted in Fig. 2. We

see that while the IX energy increases monotonically with
B, the DX energy has a richer behaviour. At low values
gives a relevant contribution ∼ −√
of the magnetic ﬁeld (B < 5T ) the Coulomb interaction
B that decreases the
energy.48 As the ﬁeld increases, the contribution of Lan-
dau energies ∼ ωc ∝ B becomes more relevant than
Coulomb interactions and the energy starts increasing,
causing a change in the slope. The IX has a simpler be-
haviour due to the spatial separation of the charge carriers
that reduces the Coulomb matrix elements causing the
eﬀect of Coulomb’s interaction to be almost lost.

In Fig. 3 we plot the energy and composition of the
ground and ﬁrst excited state of the tunnel-coupled sys-
tem, for several values of the magnetic ﬁeld. The expected
avoided crossing between the energies of Fig. 2 is found.
The composition of the ground state follows a behaviour
that can be expected from the results in Fig. 2. At small
values of the magnetic ﬁeld, for the used parameters, the
IX has lower energy than the DX, for this reason the
ground state is highly composed of IX. As the ﬁeld in-
creases, the DX and IX have similar energies and the
ground state becomes a superposition of the two kinds
of excitons. Finally, at high magnetic ﬁelds, the DX has
lower energy compared to the IX and becomes the most
relevant contribution on the composition. A similar anal-
ysis can be performed for the ﬁrst excited state but there
is something to note for B > 15T. The IX composition of
the state decreases while the DX counterpart increases,
this occurs because the IX exceeds the energy of a higher

excited state of the DX branch, DX(2s). The magnetic
ﬁeld provides an extra control channel that, jointly with
the bias voltage, may be used to manipulate the IX frac-
tion in the system, i.e., the overall dipole moment.

IV. POLARITONS IN QDMS

In the previous section, the numerical diagonalization
method was used to investigate both direct and indirect
excitons’ features. Now we extend this procedure to take
light-matter interaction into account for the generation
of polaritons with a large dipole moment.

We deﬁne dipolaritons in QDs as the dressed states
of the hamiltonian (1). As in the QW case, they are
a superposition of a DX, an IX and a cavity photon C;
the IX provides the large dipole moment and a longer
lifetime. The analogy with the QW case is straightforward,
however, provided its fully quantisation and small number
of excitations, one might expect quantum properties to be
at its maximum expression in QDs; this is a fundamental
discussion that still arises for usual polaritons49 and we
leave it for future research.

When light is included, the hamiltonian commutes with

the number of dipolaritons operator deﬁned as:

Ndip = Nph + Nexc = a†a + Nexc,

(4)

again, the hamiltonian is diagonalized for a ﬁxed manifold.
We construct a basis similar to the one used in Sec. III but
including a Fock state for the light: |Nph(cid:105)|Se1(cid:105)|Se2(cid:105)|Sh(cid:105).

position of the dark polariton. B = 9T and g = 1meV, other parameters used are the same as in Fig. 3.

We study the situation with the lowest non-trivial mani-
fold: Ndip = 1.

A. Dipolariton modes

The ﬁrst four eigenenergies of the system and the com-
position of the corresponding eigenstates as a function of
the photon energy are plotted in Fig. 4. The bare energies
of the photon, indirect exciton and direct exciton are plot-
ted with dashed lines as a reference. As in Ref. 18, the
three dipolariton branches are recognized. The avoided
crossing between the lower dipolariton LP and middle
dipolariton MP branches occurs due to light-matter inter-
action. The anticrossing between the MP and the upper
dipolariton UP branches has the same reason, however,
this splitting is reduced due to the tunnelling given the
fact that IXs do not couple with light. From the com-
position of the dipolariton branches we can see that the
optical detuning determines if the electron spends more
time shuttling between QDs or Rabi ﬂopping on the DX
transition,18 e.g., for ω > 887meV, the LP spends more
time oscillating between DX and IX but for ω < 887meV,
the LP tends to perform Rabi oscillations.

Eﬀective models like the ones used in Refs. 18, 20–
22, 25, and 27 cannot predict the avoided crossing between
the UP and a higher energy branch shown in Fig. 4a.
Our ﬁnite system model allows us to have access to higher
excited states of the excitons, in particular, of the direct
exciton DX(2s), this anticrossing causes the UP to increase
its composition of DX for high values of the photon energy
(Fig. 4b), exhibiting the limitations of eﬀective models.
When the cavity photon and the indirect exciton have
the same energy, the DX fraction is zero at the MP

branch, therefore, the dipolariton becomes a mixture of
C and IX that are not Rabi-coupled, this state is known
as dark polariton and is a prediction of the model used
in Ref. 18.
It was pointed out in Ref. 30 that this
dark polariton state was just an artefact of the eﬀective
model that neglects higher excited states of the excitons,
furthermore, the authors claim that no dark polariton
is possible with QW dipolaritons. Our model including
both the internal structure of excitons and their higher
excited states, still predicts the dark polariton in the
MP branch, showing that despite the similarity in the
dispersion relations of QW and QD dipolaritons (Fig. 4a),
diﬀerences in system parameters lead to properties that
distinguish both classes of polaritons, making worthwhile
the study of the quantum dot situation.

B. Eﬀects of magnetic ﬁeld on a single dipolariton

To see the eﬀects of the magnetic ﬁeld on a single
dipolariton, we plot the energy of the ground state and
the ﬁrst excited state as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld,
the results are shown in Fig. 5. Photon energy does
not depend on the magnetic ﬁeld while the energy of
the superposition of DX and IX increases with the ﬁeld;
at B ∼ 7T both energies are near resonance and the
light-matter interaction causes an avoided crossing.

The composition of the LP and the MP branches are
plotted in the upper panels of Fig. 5. At low B, the
LP is completely composed of IX, in contrast, the MP is
completely composed of light. Increasing the ﬁeld, the
composition of the states can be controlled to become
a mixture of the three modes: IX, DX and C. Finally,
at high values of the magnetic ﬁeld, the matter acquires

values of the magnetic ﬁeld can be used to control the
emission.

V. MULTIEXCITONIC QDS

Based on the variational method developed for excitons
and polaritons in Refs. 46, 48, and 50, we use an extension
of a BCS-like state as a trial function:

n (w2
n)
is the probability of having a direct (indirect) pair in the
state n and Nstates is the number of states we consider
in our ﬁnite basis. The normalization condition of the
BCS-like function is u2
By minimizing the mean value of the hamiltonian (cid:104)H(cid:105)
calculated using the trial function from Eq. (6), with
respect to σ, vn and wn, imposing a ﬁxed mean number
of dipolaritons, we obtain a set of self-consistent equations
that are iteratively solved to the desired accuracy. We
consider bigger quantum dots that can conﬁne several ex-
citons, this is manifested in smaller values of the parabolic
conﬁnements.41

n = 1.

Fig. 7 shows the dependence of the number of photons
inside the cavity with the magnetic ﬁeld and dipolariton
number. For a ﬁxed number of dipolaritons, Nph decreases
at low values of the magnetic ﬁeld, when the detuning
between matter and light is small. At high values of B,

the LP and MP branches, as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld.

higher energy than light and the LP acquires a high
photonic fraction.

This tuning of the composition of the dipolaritons with
the magnetic ﬁeld can be complemented with the bias
voltage and the light mode energy (with a wedged cavity),
thereby, becoming a highly controllable system.

C. Emission

Regardless of our non-dissipative model, the intensity
of the emission can be obtained from the probability of
annihilating a photon:40

I ∼ |(cid:104)Ndip − 1|a|Ndip(cid:105)|2,

(5)
where |Ndip(cid:105) and |Ndip − 1(cid:105) denote a state with dipolari-
ton number Ndip and Ndip − 1, respectively. We assume
that the system is operating at low temperatures, then the
initial state is the ground state of the Ndip system. From
the computation of Eq. (5) we ﬁnd that the transition to
the ground state of the Ndip − 1 system is the only one
with a signiﬁcant contribution to the intensity.40

The position and intensity of the emission line as a
function of Ndip for several values of B are calculated
from Eq. (5) and depicted in Fig. 6. The number of
electron-hole pairs (Nexc) is restricted to a maximum of
1, this situation is usual, for example, in self-assembled
QDs. As expected, at the limit Ndip (cid:29) Nexc, light is
emitted at bare photon energies and I ≈ Ndip. When
Ndip ∼ Nexc the excitons enhance the trapping of light,
decreasing the intensity of the emission, and causing a
red-shift. At B = 5T the system is near resonance, the
emission is minimum and highly red-shifted. Diﬀerent

The energy of the system as a function of the magnetic
ﬁeld, is displayed in Fig. 8. In contrast with Fig. 2, for
the parameters used the IX has higher energy than the
DX, this causes the ground state of the system to have
a high component of direct excitons. Therefore, as in
Fig. 2, the energy decreases at low B, but for B > 5T
the total energy of the system rises because the IXs and
DXs’ energy augments; this change in the slope indicates
a switch from paramagnetic to diamagnetic response. As
in Ref. 48 for polaritons, we ﬁnd the scaling E ∼ Ndip
as an indicator that the eﬀective interactions between
dipolaritons are weak.

We see that the overall behaviour is similar to the usual
polariton situation, however, the longer lifetimes and extra
control channels give polaritons in QDMs advantages with
respect to those in individual QDs.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have described the properties of a quantum dot
molecule embedded in a semiconductor microcavity
proposing the formation of dipolaritons in QDs. The
latter are found to be similar to their QW analogue but
we predict them to exhibit true dark polariton states. The
quantum ﬁnite system theory developed predicts the mag-
netic ﬁeld to be a control parameter for the composition
and energy of dipolaritons, and shows that it can be used
to control the number of photons inside the cavity and
the magnetic response of the system. Our approach is
diﬀerent to what have been done previously with coupled
QDs and provides a new perspective for their implemen-
tation in quantum devices. Dipolaritons in QDs is an
interesting direction for current research in polaritonics
given the recent results for their QW analogue ranging
from single photon emission to the possible realization of
quantum gates, results where the fully quantised nature
of QDs may be of great impact.
