ABSTRACT

Both CO and SiO have been observed at early and late phases in SN 1987A. H2 was predicted to
form at roughly the same time as these molecules, but was not detected at early epochs. Here we
report the detection of NIR lines from H2 at 2.12 µm and 2.40 µm in VLT/SINFONI spectra obtained
between days 6489 and 10,120. The emission is concentrated to the core of the supernova in contrast
to Hα and approximately coincides with the [Si I]/[Fe II] emission detected previously in the ejecta.
Diﬀerent excitation mechanisms and power sources of the emission are discussed. From the nearly
constant H2 luminosities we favour excitation resulting from the 44Ti decay.

1. INTRODUCTION

Observations of molecules in supernovae (SNe) have
turned out to yield important diagnostics of the condi-
tions in the cooling ejecta. The ﬁrst examples were dis-
covered in SN 1987A shortly after explosion. CO was ﬁrst
detected 112 days after explosion (Spyromilio et al. 1988)
and persisted to over 600 days (Bouchet & Danziger
1993). Both the fundamental and overtone bands were
detected. Somewhat later, at ∼ 160 days, the funda-
mental band of SiO was also detected (Aitken et al. 1988;
Roche et al. 1991). From NLTE modeling of the rovibra-
tional lines the masses were estimated to be ∼ 10−3 M⊙
for CO (Liu et al. 1992) and ∼ (4 − 8) × 10−4 M⊙ for SiO
(Liu & Dalgarno 1994). Recently at an age of 26 years
both these molecules have been detected in rotational
transitions at . 100 K with ALMA (Kamenetzky et al.
2013; Matsuura et al. 2015). The CO mass was, how-
ever, at this epoch at least an order of magnitude larger
than the estimate from the NIR observations in Liu et al.
(1992), indicating that most of the molecule formation
may have occurred later than the last NIR observations.
In addition to these molecules, Culhane & McCray
(1995, hereafter CMC) predicted that molecular hydro-
gen, H2, would form in the core. Their calculations
showed that between 400 and 1000 days after explo-
sion this would increase from a very low level to ∼ 1%
of the total H abundance, where it would freeze out.
Utrobin & Chugai (2005) later found that H2 could be
present in the tenuous H envelope even at ∼ 2 weeks af-
ter explosion, with an abundance of ∼ 10−4 of atomic
H.

Although predicted long ago, and constituting a sub-
stantial fraction of the ejecta mass, no detection of H2

has been found in a SN. While H2 has been detected in
the Crab nebula (Graham et al. 1990) the origin of this
is unknown, although Graham et al. argue for the forma-
tion in the ejecta. In this paper we report clear evidence
of H2 from NIR rovibrational ejecta lines in SN 1987A
observed with VLT/SINFONI at very late phases.

2. OBSERVATIONS

The H and K-band observations, covering 1.45 −
1.80µm and 1.95 − 2.45µm, respectively, were obtained
2004–2014 using the SINFONI Integral Field Spectro-
graph at the VLT (Eisenhauer et al. 2003; Bonnet et al.
2004). The log of the observations is given in Table 1.
The data were reduced using the standard ESO pipeline
(Modigliani et al. 2007) and are discussed in detail in
Kjær et al. (2010), together with modelling of the atomic
emission. Additional dedicated software was developed
by us to combine observations spread over many epochs.
The absolute reproducibility (cross calibration) of the
standard stars was better than 5%. The encircled en-
ergy of the PSF for 80% of the emission is 0.150 × 0.125′′
in the 2005 K-band observation (Kjær et al. 2010), which
gives a good measure of the spatial resolution. The spec-
tral resolution is 66 km s−1 and 110 km s−1 for the K-
and H-band, respectively. Because of the short exposure
of the 2004 observations we do not discuss this epoch fur-
ther. The observations in 2004, 2005, 2011 and 2014 are
discussed in Kjær et al. (2007, 2010) and Larsson et al.
(2013, 2016).

cated near the end of the K-band atmospheric window
and also near the rise of the thermal background from
the telescope, which could give rise to the appearance
of features in the spectra. We have therefore examined
individually all frames to ensure that the residual ther-
mal and atmospheric backgrounds do not create artefacts
that would mimic the Q-branch emission from the SN.

3. RESULTS

In Fig. 1 we show a compilation of the K-band spectra
of the ejecta from 2005 to 2014, days 6832, 7606, 8694
and 10,120. In order to minimise the contamination from
the ring and to compare the ﬂuxes from the same co-
moving region we use an expanding elliptical aperture
enclosing the emitting H2 region, shown in Fig. 2. Scat-
tered light from the ring was removed as in Larsson et al.
(2016), using the fact that lines from the ring are much
narrower (FWHM ∼ 300 km s−1) compared to the ejecta
lines (FWHM ∼ 2300 km s−1). This subtraction is illus-
trated in the upper spectrum in Fig. 1. The spectra were
binned by a factor three.

The strongest line at all epochs is the He I 2.058 µm
line. We also see a faint Brγ line at 2.166 µm. In addition
to these, there is a clear line at 2.12 µm and a strong,
broad feature at 2.40 µm. Based on the absence of other
natural candidates (see Sect. 4.1) we identify the 2.12 µm

imum (blue) ejecta region for each image. The star marks the

2.40 µm as a blend of the (1,0) Q(1 – 3) transitions at
2.406, 2.413, 2.423 µm. We do not detect the overtone
CO band, which would peak between 2.30-2.35 µm.

In Fig. 2 we show the spatial distribution in 2005
of the 2.40 µm feature, with and without subtrac-
tion of the ’continuum’ in the line-free region between
2.300 − 2.345µm, together with H2 2.12 µm, Hα from
HST (Larsson et al. 2013), and He I 2.058 µm, and
[Si I]/[Fe II] from SINFONI (Kjær et al. 2010). The
emission from the circumstellar ring in the 2.12 µm and
2.40 µm images is a result of H I line and continuum
emission.

From the ﬁgure we note that the 2.12 µm and 2.40 µm
emission have a markedly diﬀerent distribution compared
to Hα. Most of the emission is concentrated to the cen-
ter, which indicates that it is not aﬀected by the X-ray
heating from the ring collision, which dominates the Hα
morphology (Larsson et al. 2011).

4. ORIGIN OF THE H2 EMISSION

4.1. Spectral modeling

To check that the identiﬁcation of the lines with H2 is
consistent with wavelengths and expected relative ﬂuxes,
as well as the presence of other lines in this spectral win-
dow, we have calculated synthetic spectra for diﬀerent
assumptions for the H2 excitation. Because the tem-
perature in the H rich gas in the SN core is . 200 K

(Jerkstrand et al. 2011; Kamenetzky et al. 2013) ther-
mal excitations of the vibrational levels are likely to
be unimportant. The remaining possibilities are exci-
tation by non-thermal electrons or alternatively by UV
ﬂuorescence. Both these processes can lead to ioniza-
tion or photodissociation of the H2. Reformation of the
molecule will then lead to vibrational-rotational excita-
tion. Black & Dalgarno (1976), however, argue that ﬂu-
orescence should be more eﬃcient, unless the UV ﬂux is
heavily absorbed.

There are two sources of non-thermal electrons in the
ejecta. The 44Ti decay, which dominates the radioac-
tive input (Jerkstrand et al. 2011; Boggs et al. 2015),
produces positrons, which results in a cascade of non-
thermal electrons with energies & 10 eV. Whether the
positrons will reach the H rich blobs of the ejecta depends
on the magnetic ﬁeld. Coulomb collisions alone cannot
trap them in the iron rich regions where the positrons are
created (Jerkstrand et al. 2011), but even a weak ﬁeld
decreases the mean free path dramatically. It is, how-
ever, conceivable that a fraction of the positrons may
escape the 44Ti sites and may then ionize and excite
the H rich parts of the core. The other source of fast
electrons may be X-rays from the interaction with the
ring. The evolution of the optical ﬂux from the ejecta
is now dominated by these X-rays (Larsson et al. 2011).
When absorbed these give rise to fast electrons, and a
similar cascade of non-thermal electrons as the positrons
(Fransson et al. 2013). A similar scenario has been ad-
vocated by Richardson et al. (2013) for the H2 emission
in the Crab nebula. The presence of a pulsar generating
the relativistic particles makes, however, the situation
diﬀerent from the ejecta in SN 1987A.

To test the non-thermal electron scenario we use the
relative ﬂuxes calculated by Gredel & Dalgarno (1995,
their Table 4). Note that the relative strengths of the
lines depend on the rotational temperature of the ground
state levels, as well as the degree of ionization. The cal-
culation referred to assumes a temperature of 300 K for
the ground state populations and an electron energy of
30 eV. We have then normalized the line ﬂuxes to that of
the 2.122 µm line. To approximately include the atomic
lines we have also added the 44Ti powered ejecta spec-
trum from Kjær et al. (2010), scaled to the extraction
aperture we use (Fig. 3).

There may also be a weak continuum contribution.
Synchrotron emission from the ring is observed at radio
wavelengths with a spectrum Fν ≈ 25(ν/100 GHz)−0.8
mJy (Indebetouw et al. 2014). Extrapolating to 2.2 µm
gives a ﬂux of ∼ 4.8 × 10−18 erg s−1 cm−2 ˚A−1. A mi-
nor fraction from high latitude emission above the ring
plane could therefore contribute to the NIR continuum,
unless synchrotron cooling would steepen the spectrum.
Dust emission from ultra-small grains could also con-
tribute. From ALMA observations we know there is a
strong source of dust emission in the core of the SN
(Matsuura et al. 2015) with a temperature of ∼ 24 K.
Sarangi & Cherchneﬀ (2015) ﬁnd that the size distribu-
tion of grains ranges from ∼ 10 ˚A to micron sized grains.
Ultra-small grains will be transiently heated by UV pho-
tons to very high temperatures (e.g., Draine 2011) and
emit their radiation in the mid- to NIR. While the abso-
lute line ﬂuxes depend on the continuum level, our qual-

3

itative results for the spectral models are not sensitive to
these assumptions. Because of the uncertainty we have
not included this component.

The line proﬁles are assumed to be Gaussian with
FWHM = 2300 km s−1, the same as that found for the
CO lines (Kamenetzky et al. 2013). We concentrate here
on the co-added H- and K-band spectra from 2005 and
2007 which have the best S/N . In the lower panel of
Fig. 3 we show these spectra together with the synthetic
spectrum.

UV ﬂuorescence from the H2 ground state requires pho-
tons between 912 ˚A and 1108 ˚A, which may be created in-
ternally in the ejecta (Sect. 5), or alternatively from the
ring collision. Lyα is strong from the ring (France et al.
2011) and resonance ﬂuorescence from the H2 v = 2 levels
(Shull 1978) may be possible. This process, however, re-
quires either a temperature of & 1000 K or a suﬃciently
strong UV ﬁeld for a signiﬁcant population of this level.
Between 912 ˚A and ∼ 1150 ˚A little is known about the
ﬂux from the ring.

For

line strengths

the UV ﬂuorescence model we have taken
the relative H2
from Model 14 of
Black & van Dishoeck (1987) and again scaled this to the
2.122 µm ﬂux. The relative line strengths are not very
sensitive to the speciﬁc shape of the spectrum in the far-
UV or to the density as long as this is . 104 cm−3.

Comparing the two models, the relative ﬂux of the
2.122 µm and the 2.40 µm lines is similar and close to the
observed ratio, especially considering the uncertain con-
tinuum level. This, together with the good ﬁt of the line
proﬁles, conﬁrms the H2 line identiﬁcations. Note also
the absence of atomic lines at both these wavelengths.

The main diﬀerence between the two models is the
near absence of excitations to v ≥ 2 in the non-thermal
model.
In the K-band Gredel & Dalgarno (1995) ﬁnd
the the (2,1)S(1) 2.248 µm/(1,0)S(1) 2.122 µm ratio to
be 0.54 the UV dominated case, compared to 0.06 in
the non-thermal electron case. From Fig. 3 we see that
the 2.248 µm and 2.223 µm lines give a better ﬁt to the
feature at ∼ 2.25 µm for the UV ﬂuorescence model. Ac-
cording to this model weaker lines at 1.953, 2.034, 2.071,
2.351 µm may also be present in the observations. Al-
though the H-band is more crowded, we note that there
is in the UV model a line feature at 1.74 µm which does
not coincide with any line included in the atomic model
and coincides with a blend of comparatively strong H2
lines between 1.73 − 1.75 µm. Also H2 lines at 1.50 and
1.62 µm may possibly be present. The models in Fig.
3 therefore favour the UV excitation model. This con-
clusion is, however, fairly marginal, given the S/N level
of the spectrum and uncertainties in both the H2 and
atomic line ﬂuxes.

From the line ﬁts we estimate the total luminosity in
the 2014 (day 10,120) spectrum of the 2.40 µm H2 lines
to ∼ 6.2 × 1032 erg s−1 and of the 2.122 µm line to ∼
2.4 × 1032 erg s−1. This should be compared to the total
input from positrons which is ∼ 1036 erg s−1, or ∼ 1/3
of the bolometric luminosity (Larsson et al. 2011). For
the non-thermal electron case Gredel & Dalgarno (1995)
ﬁnds that 46% of the H2 emission is in the 1.95 - 2.45
µm range, while in the UV ﬂuorescence case 15 % is in
this range. The total energy required for the IR H2 lines
is therefore ∼ 2 × 1033 erg s−1 and ∼ 6 × 1033 erg s−1,

respectively.

4.2. Time evolution

A distinguishing factor between the two diﬀerent
sources of energy for the H2 emission, either from the
radioactive decay of 44Ti in the ejecta or from an exter-
nal UV or X-ray ﬂux from the ring collision, is the time
evolution. From day 6500 to 9200 both the soft and hard
X-ray ﬂux from the ring increased by a factor of ∼ 4.4
(Helder et al. 2013). If the excitation is connected to the
external X-ray or UV ﬂux we expect the H2 emission to
increase by a substantial factor, while the energy input
by 44Ti is expected to decrease slowly.

A complication when measuring the ﬂux evolution is
the strong and wavelength dependent ‘continuum’ level,
which most likely is a blend of weak lines and true contin-
uum (e.g., Fig. 3). This makes absolute measurements of
the ﬂuxes diﬃcult and prone to systematic errors. Using
the same prescription for the continuum level the trends
should, however, not be aﬀected. For the ’continuum’
we use the average ﬂux between 2.09 − 2.11 µm for the
He I and the H2 2.122 µm lines and the 2.30 − 2.35 µm
range for the H2 2.40 µm blend, which are chosen to be
reasonably free of other emission lines. To minimize any
remaining contribution from scattered emission from the
ring to the He I line we exclude for this line the central
part within ±700 km s−1 in the ﬂux measurement.

From Table 2 we conclude that the H2 2.40 µm lu-
minosity is nearly constant within the statistical errors,

H2 and He I luminositiesa. See text for errors.

which we estimate to 0.15 × 1032 erg s−1, while the He I
line shows an increase by a factor of ∼ 2.3 from day 6832
to 10,120. The low H2 2.122 µm ﬂux makes it diﬃcult to
draw any ﬁrm conclusion from this, although it is con-
sistent with a constant ﬂux within the errors. Note that
these luminosities are likely to be systematically under-
estimated by a considerable factor, as is e.g., seen from
the models in Fig. 3. The absolute luminosities given in
Sect. 3 are probably more accurate. Here we are more
concerned with the time evolution, without making as-
sumptions about the excitation mechanism.

The nearly constant H2 luminosities indicate that these
lines are powered by the 44Ti decay, either through the
UV generated in the ejecta or possibly through leaking
positrons. Gamma-rays from the 44Ti decay gives an
input decreasing with time as τγ ∝ 1/t2. They, however,
only contribute marginally to the H2 luminosity.

5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Summarizing, we ﬁnd that the spectrum marginally
favours the UV ﬂuorescence model and that it is powered
by the 44Ti decay. These may together be realized if the
excitation is dominated by diﬀuse internal UV radiation
in the ejecta.

The H2 emission is concentrated to the core, as is the
case for the [Si I]/[Fe II] 1.644 µm line (Fig. 2). This
result is consistent with the absence of time evolution.
The presence of H2 in the core is also consistent with the
Hα proﬁle from early observations, which was seen down
to . 700 km s−1 (Kozma & Fransson 1998). Outside the
core the UV and X-ray emission from the ring collision
may dissociate the H2, while these X-rays are responsible
for most of the Hα emission, resulting in the ’horse-shoe’
shape in Fig. 2. The core itself is largely shielded from X-
rays by the high metallicity (Fransson et al. 2013). Also
the UV from the ring may be absorbed at energies higher
than the C I photoelectric threshold at 11.2 eV (< 1100
˚A), depending on the covering factor of the C rich regions
relative to the H rich in the core.

The UV excitation scenario requires an internally gen-
erated UV ﬁeld, like the He I two-photon continuum,
as proposed by CMC (see also Jerkstrand et al. 2011).
CMC also point out that the total opacity of the H
rich region in the range 912 < λ . 1400 ˚A should be
dominated by resonance scattering in the Lyman and
Werner bands of H2, converting the radiation in this re-
gion into ﬂuorescence lines between 1400 ˚A and ∼ 1700
˚A. Sternberg (1989) has calculated this in detail, based
on an ISM-like UV spectrum. Of particular interest is the
strong blend of lines at 1590-1610 ˚A, which also stands
out in the simulations of CMC. In the COS spectrum by
France et al. (2011) there is indeed a weak feature at this
wavelength. The spectrum is, however, complex and the
signiﬁcance of this feature is marginal.

Most of the H2 formation in the CMC models took
place before ∼ 1000 days after explosion. NIR obser-
vations between days 377 to 1114 (Meikle et al. 1993)
showed a weak feature which they proposed could be due
to the 2.122 µm line., but noted that this could be due
to [Fe II] 2.133 µm. In the spectra before 600 days this
feature was much stronger than in the models by CMC,
while at later epochs it was consistent with the models.
The observations of Meikle et al. (1993) did not show the
2.40 µm line, so no deﬁnite conclusion could be drawn.
Other H2 lines expected in the UV case include blends
at ∼ 1.24, 1.31, and 1.40 µm. The J-band is, however,
more crowded than the K-band and has a lower S/N
and Strehl ratio and is therefore here not shown. The
lowest excitation lines of H2 at 28.211 µm and 17.030 µm
are expected to have ﬂuxes ∼ 1.5 and ∼ 1.0 times the
2.122 µm line, respectively.

Finally, the fact that the He I line shows an increase
similar to Hα (Fransson et al. 2013) implies that at least
part of this emission should be aﬀected by the X-ray in-
put from the ring collision. This is somewhat surprising,
given the similar distribution of this emission to that of
H2 (Fig. 2). The He I emission, however, has contribu-
tions both from the H, He and Fe/He zones (Kjær et al.
2010). The Fe/He component, together with the mixed-
in H- and He-rich material in the core, may therefore
explain the centrally peaked He I emission, while the
former two components in the envelope may be respon-

5

sible for the luminosity increase, which is mainly seen in
the line wings, as for Hα (Larsson et al. 2016).

In conclusion, the discovery of H2 in SN 1987A adds
a new and important diagnostic of the conditions in the
ejecta and may, together with observations with ALMA,
provide new insight into the chemistry of the H rich re-
gions of the core (e.g., Cherchneﬀ & Dwek 2009).
