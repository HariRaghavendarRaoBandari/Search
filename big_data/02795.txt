Abstract

We review the derivation of light-cone interaction vertices for fermionic and bosonic ﬁelds
of arbitrary spin. The resulting amplitudes and their factorization properties are discussed.
We then show how this symmetry-based approach works for theories with extended super-
symmetry like N = 4 Yang-Mills theory and N = 8 supergravity.

1 Introduction

At the level of the equations of motion, there has been considerable progress in our under-
standing of higher spin theories [1]. However, a description of higher spin ﬁelds (λ > 2) in
a Lagrangian formalism, essential to quantization, remains elusive. There are various no-go
theorems relating to higher spin ﬁelds and one of the things they tell us is that we cannot
write down a consistent interacting theory of massless higher spin ﬁelds in ﬂat spacetime.
In contradiction to this statement is the result of [2] where a consistent cubic interaction
vertex was constructed in the light-cone formalism. Given that the cubic interaction ver-
tex is in some sense trivial and may be written down based on helicity and dimensional
considerations [3] the question then becomes whether a quartic interaction vertex can be
arrived at within the same formalism. The discussions in [3] outline why a BCFW [4] type
construction is bound to fail but this does not rise to the level of a proof. It is worth noting,
at this stage, that most of the no-go literature pertaining to higher spin theories [5] assumed
theories with manifest locality and manifest Lorentz invariance. Neither of these properties
is manifest in light-cone gauge and this is one motivation to study higher spin ﬁelds in this
gauge. Another motivation is the exclusive focus on the physical degrees of freedom. Since
the ﬁrst paper on light-cone cubic interaction vertices, there has been considerable work on
the subject [6, 7, 8, 9].

The procedure we review here, is that initiated in [2]. We revisited their study [9] in the light
of recent advances in ﬁeld theory [10]. These new methods, when introduced to the older
analysis of [2] yielded among other results, a Lagrangian origin [11] for the KLT relations [12]
and factorization properties [8]. The formalism in [2] starts with just the Poincar´e algbera,
for four dimensional ﬂat spacetime, in light-cone gauge. Among the generators of this
algebra is + component of momentum which is the light-cone Hamiltonian. An ansatz for
this Hamiltonian is made based on dimensional analysis and helicity and then reﬁned by
requiring closure of the Poincar´e algebra1. This leads to a class of higher spin cubic vertices.

This framework is particularly interesting in the context of aribtrary spin theories in non-ﬂat
spacetime backgrounds. The formalism described here may be extended to AdS4 (for the
spin=2 case, see [13]). The cubic interaction vertices are straightforward to derive in this
background but the quartic interaction vertices are challenging. This approach is likely to
yield key ingredients necessary to establish a Lagrangian origin to the Vasiliev program [1].
In other words, a derivation of consistent quartic interaction vertices involving higher spin
ﬁelds in AdS4 should necessitate the inclusion of a tower of higher spin ﬁelds thus providing
a Lagrangian origin to the Vasiliev equations of motion.

The approach we review is particularly powerful when applied to supersymmetric theo-
ries where we have more than just the Poincar´e algebra to work with. Supergravity in
eleven dimensions [14], when reduced to d = 4, becomes the maximally supersymmetric
N = 8 theory. Its light-cone formulation in superspace is incomplete because its higher-
point interactions are not known in terms of a light-cone superﬁeld. A simpler, yet in
many ways similar, theory in d = 4 is the maximally supersymmetric N = 4 Yang-Mills
theory. The N = 8 and N = 4 theories are each described by a single light-cone superﬁeld
which captures their physical degrees of freedom. Both theories may be oxidized [15] to

their higher-dimensional parent theories, yielding superspace descriptions without auxiliary
ﬁelds. However, while there exist two distinct algebraic methods to derive the entire classi-
cal Hamiltonian of N = 4 Yang-Mills there is considerable diﬃculty in deriving the N = 8
theory even to quartic order.

2 Poincar´e generators

We deﬁne light-cone co-ordinates in (−, +, +, +) Minkowski space-time by

x± =

x0 ± x3
√2

,

x =

x1 + ix2

√2

,

¯x =

x1 − ix2

√2

.

(1)

The corresponding derivatives are ∂± , ¯∂ and ∂. One of the reasons d = 4 is so special is
that all massless ﬁelds have exactly two physical degrees of freedom, which we call φ and
¯φ. The ﬁeld φ has helicity λ while the ﬁeld ¯φ has helicity −λ. The light-cone generators of
the Poincar´e algebra are

p− = i

p+ = −i∂+ = −p−

where the time translation operator is introduced through the Poisson bracket

H ≡Z d3xH = −Z d3x ¯φ ∂ ¯∂ φ ,
H ≡Z d3xH =Z d3x ∂− ¯φ δHφ ,

δHφ ≡ ∂+φ = {φ,H} .

(5)

(6)

On the light-cone, spacetime symmetries split into two types. Kinematical symmetries are
unaltered by interactions while dynamical symmetries pick up corrections and are non-
linearly realized on the ﬁelds. In supersymmetric theories, the supersymmetries also sepa-
rate into dynamical and kinematical supersymmetries. For the interacting theory, δH picks
up corrections, order by order in the coupling constant α, as do

δj+−φ ;

δj−φ ;

δ¯j−φ .

(7)

These corrections, non-linear in nature, need to be constructed.

3 Bosonic ﬁelds

We review here, the procedure to derive cubic interaction vertices for three bosonic ﬁelds
of arbitrary spin. For additional details, we refer the reader to [8]. At cubic order, the
following structures (at order α) appear in the Hamiltonian

Hφ1 ∼ φ2φ3 ;

Hφ2 ∼ φ1φ3 ;

Hφ3 ∼ φ1φ2 .

As a, b > 0, the ﬁrst condition implies that the vertex exists only if λ2 + λ3 > λ1. Let
λ ≡ λ2 + λ3 − λ1 so a + b = λ. The ansatz is now a sum of the (λ + 1) terms

We ﬁnd

The power of this approach is clear. One example: H α vanishes for λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = λ′ in
(22) for odd λ′ making the introduction of a gauge group mandatory for odd integer spins.

3.1 Factorization and perturbative ties

The above results may be written in the language of spinor helicity products [10]

[kl] = √2

(23)

Equation (22) contains two kinds of terms: ¯φφφ and φ ¯φ ¯φ and the Fourier coeﬃcient of the
second variety φ1(p) ¯φ2(k) ¯φ3(l) δ4(p+k+l) is

(λ1+λ2+λ3)

(24)

(25)

This means that given vertices for (λ1, λ2, λ3) and (λ′
3), their product yields the
vertex for (λ1 + λ′
3). Further, the coeﬃcient for (nλ1, nλ2, nλ3) is that for
(λ1, λ2, λ3) raised to the power n [8]. In particular, λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = 1 and λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = 2
oﬀers a ﬁeld-theoretic realization [11] of the KLT relations [12].

Once again, the algebra teaches us that for odd helicity φ1, self-interactions require an

N = 4 Yang-Mills [18].

5 Theories with supersymmetry: N = 4 Yang-Mills theory

In this section we discuss this formalism in the context of maximally supersymmetric ﬁeld
theories [2]. The ten-dimensional N = 1 supermultiplet has eight vectors and eight spinors
of the little group SO(8). Reduction to four dimensions involves

SO(8) ⊃ SO(2) × SO(6) ,

(49)

yielding

with SO(2) subscripts. The (N = 4, d = 4) theory contains six scalar ﬁelds, one vector
ﬁeld and four spinor ﬁelds (and conjugates). Introduce Grassmann variables θm and ¯θm
(m, n,··· = 1 , . . . 4) which transform as the 4 and ¯4 of SU (4). Their derivatives are

generator [19]

which along with j+− yields

for the coupling constant in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory). For additional details, we
refer the reader to [2, 19].

p− φ = − i g ∂+µ
δg

[ ¯∂a ∂+ρ

φ ¯∂b ∂+σ

φ ] .

Exactly like in the non-supersymmetric case, closure of the algebra to order g yields

a + b = 1 ,

µ + ρ + σ = 0 .

(78)

(79)

The need for a gauge structure function follows as before. The variation that satisﬁes
Poincar´e invariance to order g is then

p− φa = − i g f abc 1
δg

∂+ ( ¯∂ φb ∂+ φc) .

In a similar manner, the non-linear boosts are [19]

p− φa + i g f abc 1

∂+ (cid:26) ( θ

∂ θ − 1 ) φb ∂+ φc )(cid:27) .

(80)

(81)

One approach to deriving the Hamiltonian for this theory is to use chirality, dimensional
analysis, helicity and elementary commutators to argue that the ﬁrst order dynamical
supersymmetry has the form

δg
¯q−

φa = − g f abc

∂+ (2ν+1) n ¯d ∂+ ν φb ∂+ (ν+1) φco ,

where (d)4 ≡ ǫmnpq dmdndpdq and ν is a free parameter. Its conjugate with (59) yields

The dynamical supersymmetry does not extend to g2 [19] and as a consequence, the classical
Hamiltonian terminates at order g2. Rather than extend the procedure here to order g2,
which is lengthy, we adopt a diﬀerent approach to arrive at the quartic interaction vertex.

We simply ask that the supersymmetry variations leave the Hamiltonian invariant [19]

leads to the previously derived cubic vertex in (85). Next, vary the cubic vertex to obtain
the quartic vertex using (89). The cubic vertex involves a part with the transverse derivative
∂ and a part with ¯∂. But H g2
does not contain transverse derivatives since it stems from
supersymmetries (at order g) which do not carry transverse derivatives. Thus

since δ0

contains no ∂. For supersymmetries to commute with the Hamiltonian then

The detailed form of the Hamiltonian is presented in [19] and is not relevant here since
our aim is to describe the method. Interestingly, this Hamiltonian has the structure of a
quadratic form [19].

6 Theories with supersymmetry: N = 8 supergravity
Having described N = 4 Yang-Mills, we now move to the other maximally supersymmetric
theory in four dimensions, N = 8 supergravity [20]. All the ﬁelds in N = 8 supergravity
are similarly captured by a single superﬁeld [18]. θm now transforms as the 8 of SU (8).

It is technically very challenging to extend this derivation to order κ2 for supergravity. For
this reason, we are forced to consider other approaches. As mentioned earlier, the Hamil-
tonian of =4 Yang-Mills is a quadratic form [19] and this turns out to be a feature shared
by all maximally supersymmetric theories and hence valid for N = 8 supergravity [21].
Using N = 4 Yang-Mills as a guide, the light-cone Hamiltonian for N = 8 supergravity is
of the form

which is the cubic interaction vertex - and matches that derived by gauge ﬁxing the covariant
theory in (105).

This quadratic form structure leads us naturally to a quartic interaction vertex [21] but the
result is too cumbersome to be useful in calculations. There is a more recent coherent state
strategy that seems to make more sense but again its use in explicit computations is unclear
at this point. The way forward here appears to be through the exceptional symmetry in
the theory. In particular, using the E7(7) symmetry in N = 8 supergravity in conjunction
with the quadratic form approach yields a much simpler quartic interaction vertex [22].

As far as N = 8 supergravity is concerned, it seems fairly clear that there are two distinct
approaches to building the theory. The ﬁrst is to use the superPoincar´e algebra exclusively
while the other is to follow the exceptional symmetry in the theory [23]. Clearly a ﬁeld
redeﬁnition should relate the results of these two approaches.

It is also interesting to note that this valuable exceptional symmetry grows under dimen-
sional reduction [24]. In d = 3 it becomes an E8(8) symmetry, an E9 symmetry in d = 2, an
E10 symmetry in d = 1 and an E11 symmetry in d = 0. It seems possible that some or all
of these higher symmetry groups could be present in the eleven-dimensional theory itself.
Their link to clarifying the ﬁniteness issue [25] relating to the N = 8 model is certainly
worth examining further.

There are a number of open questions worth exploring. First, can this light-cone symmetry-
based approach provide a Lagrangian origin to the Vasiliev equations of motion in AdS4?
Second, can we derive consistent quartic interaction vertices in ﬂat spacetime? If not, where
exactly does the procedure fail and how does this ﬁt in with the exisiting no-go literature
pertaining to higher spins in ﬂat spacetime. Third, can this approach oﬀer hints regarding
the missing ingredients for the (N = 2, 0) theory in d = 6? In particular, since we know
the six-dimensional supercofrmal algebra in light-cone gauge can we close commutators and
zero in on what structures are missing [26]?
