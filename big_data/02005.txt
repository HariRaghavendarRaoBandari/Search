Abstract

Motivated by what one observes dealing with PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, we
discuss what happens if a physical system is driven by a diagonalizable Hamiltonian with
not all real eigenvalues.
In particular, we consider the functional structure related to
systems living in ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and we show that certain intertwining
relations can be deduced also in this case if we introduce suitable antilinear operators.
We also analyze a simple model, computing the transition probabilities in the broken and
in the unbroken regime.

Introduction

In ordinary quantum mechanics one of the fundamental axiom of the whole theory is that the
Hamiltonian H of the physical system must be self-adjoint: H = H †. This condition, shared
also by all the observables of the system, is important since it ensures that the eigenvalues of
these observables, and of the hamiltonian in particular, are real quantities. However, this is not
a necessary condition, and in fact several physically motivated examples can be found in the
literature considering non self-adjoint operators whose spectra consist of only real eigenvalues,
see [1] and references therein, for instance. This situation is particularly interesting for people
in the PT-community, who quite often work with Hamiltonian operators which are not self-
adjoint, but simply pseudo-symmetric or PT-symmetric, [2, 3]. In two recent papers we have
investigated Hamiltonians which are not self-adjoint, but still possess real eigenvalues, mainly
with the aim of understanding how the dynamics and the transition probability should be
deﬁned, or at least postulated, in these cases. This has been done ﬁrst in ﬁnite-dimensional
and later in inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces, [4] and [5]. Already in [4] the importance of
having only real eigenvalues was pointed out: going from real to complex eigenvalues of H can,
in fact be very unpleasant from a purely abstract point of view. However, in PT quantum
mechanics, this is exactly the kind of transition which is of some interest in concrete situations,
and for this reason it is deﬁnitely interesting, in our opinion, to carry on a general analysis of
this case. This is what this paper is about: Hamiltonians with (some) complex eigenvalues,
and some possible applications of these operators.

All throughout this paper we will work with ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Hence, all the
operators involved in our analysis are bounded (hence, everywhere deﬁned) and their inverse,
when they exist, are bounded as well. Of course, going from a ﬁnite to an inﬁnite dimensional
Hilbert space is an absolutely non trivial task. Therefore, most of our claims, though giving
indications also in this latter case, are rigorously true only in the present, ﬁnite-dimensional,
settings. We will comment more on this aspect all along the paper.

This article is organized as follows:
In the next section, after a brief review of what has been done in [4], we consider which kind
of new features arise when the Hamiltonian possesses non real eigenvalues. In particular, we
discuss the role of antilinear operators in this context and we show how this type of operators are
needed for deducing useful intertwining relations. In this way we will be able to ﬁnd isospectral
operators which are constructed out of H and H †. Notice that, of course, H and H † cannot be
isospectral by themselves, due to the presence of complex eigenvalues. Section 3 is devoted to

2

an example taken from the literature, while our conclusions are contained in Section 4. To keep
the paper self-consistent, in the Appendix we give some results on antilinear operators which
are used all throughout the paper and cannot be easily found in the literature.

2 A general settings for H 6= H†

As we have already said, in this paper we will focus on the easiest situation, i.e. on ﬁnite
dimensional Hilbert spaces.
In this way our linear operators are ﬁnite matrices. The main
ingredient is a linear operator (i.e. a matrix) H, acting on the vector space CN +1, with H 6= H †
and with exactly N + 1 distinct eigenvalues En, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N. Here, the adjoint H † of
H is the usual one, i.e. the complex conjugate of the transpose of the matrix H. Because
of what follows, and in order to ﬁx the ideas, it is useful to remind here that the adjoint of
an operator X, X †, is deﬁned in terms of the natural scalar product h., .i of the Hilbert space
H = (cid:0)CN +1,h., .i(cid:1): hXf, gi = (cid:10)f, X †g(cid:11), for all f, g ∈ CN +1, where hf, gi = PN
k=0 fk gk, with
obvious notation. As stressed in the Introduction, our main interest here is to the case when
some of the eigenvalues En of H are not real. However, to simplify the treatment, we will assume
that each eigenvalue En has multiplicity one. The extension to higher ﬁnite multiplicities is
easy, but it will not be considered here to avoid making the notation unnecessarily heavier.

Before starting, it is necessary to clarify some notation adopted in this paper: we will use
CN +1 any time we only want to stress the nature of vector space of the set of our vectors. When
it is important to stress the topological (i.e. the scalar products and the norms) aspects of this
set, we will use H instead of CN +1 (and, later, Hϕ or HΨ). Before starting with our analysis,
we recall few of our results in [4], in order to see later the diﬀerences with the situation which is
more relevant for us in this paper, i.e. the case in which the imaginary part of some eigenvalue
of H is diﬀerent from zero.

2.1 All the eigenvalues are real: a review

We assume here that H has N + 1 distinct real eigenvalues, corresponding to N + 1 eigenvectors
ϕk, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N:

(2.1)
The set Fϕ = {ϕk, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N} is a basis for CN +1, since the eigenvalues are all diﬀerent.
Then an unique biorthogonal basis of H, FΨ = {Ψk, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N}, surely exists, [6, 7]:
hϕk, Ψli = δk,l, for all k, l, and we have H †Ψk = EkΨk for all k. Moreover, for all f ∈ H, we

Hϕk = Ekϕk.

3

k=0 |ϕk ih Ψk| = PN

k=0 hϕk, fi Ψk = PN

k=0 hΨk, fi ϕk. Hence, both Fϕ and FΨ are complete (or

can write f = PN
total): if f ∈ H is such that hϕk, fi = 0, or hΨk, fi = 0, for all k, then f = 0.
Using the bra-ket notation we can write PN
all f, g, h ∈ H, we deﬁne (|f ih g|)h := hg, hi f .
k=0 |ϕk ih ϕk| and SΨ = PN
PN

k=0 |Ψk ih ϕk| = 11, where, for
Introducing, as usual, the operators Sϕ =
k=0 |Ψk ih Ψk|, we know that these are bounded positive, self-
adjoint, invertible operators, one the inverse of the other: SΨ = S−1
ϕ . We want to stress that,
in our present settings, there is absolutely no problem with the domains of these (and other)
operators, while in [1] and in [5] we have discussed what happens for inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert
spaces. This generalization is absolutely non trivial, but will not be considered here. Using
standard techniques in functional analysis, or direct matrix computations, we can introduce the
positive square roots of SΨ and Sϕ, and again we have S1/2
. Useful (and well known)
properties are the following:

Ψ = S−1/2

ϕ

SϕΨn = ϕn, SΨϕn = Ψn,

as well as

SΨH = H †SΨ, SϕH † = HSϕ.

(2.2)

0 = S1/2

ϕ H †S1/2

Ψ HS1/2

If we now deﬁne H0 := S1/2
H0 = H †
H of eigenstates of the self-adjoint operator H0: H0ek = Ekek.

ϕ Ψk, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N, we see that
Ψ , and that E = {ek, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N} is an orthonormal (o.n.) basis of

Similarly to what is done in many places in the literature, SΨ and Sϕ can be used now to

and ek = S1/2

Ψ ϕk = S1/2

ϕ

deﬁne new scalar products in CN +1:

hf, giϕ :=(cid:10)S1/2

ϕ f, S1/2

ϕ g(cid:11) = hSϕf, gi ,

hf, giΨ :=DS1/2

Ψ f, S1/2

Ψ gE = hSΨf, gi ,

(2.3)

for all f, g ∈ CN +1. Due to the properties of SΨ and Sϕ, these are really scalar products,
everywhere deﬁned on CN +1. Of course, the related norms k.k, k.kϕ and k.kΨ are all equivalent1,
since, for instance

1
kS−1/2

ϕ

k

kfk ≤ kfkϕ ≤ kS1/2

ϕ k kfk,

for all f ∈ CN +1. A similar double inequality could be deduced also for kfkΨ. Then, from a
topological point of view, H, Hϕ :=(cid:16)CN +1,h., .iϕ(cid:17) and HΨ :=(cid:0)CN +1,h., .iΨ(cid:1) are all equivalent.
However, they are diﬀerent under other aspects: to begin with, they diﬀer in the deﬁnition
of the adjoint of the operators, which is † in H, but which becomes ♭ in Hϕ and ♯ in HΨ:
hXf, giϕ = (cid:10)f, X ♭g(cid:11)ϕ and hXf, giΨ = (cid:10)f, X ♯g(cid:11)Ψ, for all f, g ∈ CN +1. It is easy to see that ♯

and ♭ are really adjoints2, and to deduce the following relations:

X ♭ = SΨX †Sϕ,

X ♯ = SϕX †SΨ

and X ♭ = S2

ΨX ♯S2
ϕ,

(2.4)

1This means that, if a sequence of vectors fn ∈ CN +1 converges in k.k, it also converges in k.kϕ and in k.kΨ.
2For instance, (X ♯)♯ = X and (XY )♯ = Y ♯X ♯, for all operators X and Y on CN +1.

4

for each operator X on CN +1.

It is now an easy computation to check that H = H ♯, and

that H † = (H †)♭. Indeed we have hHf, giΨ = hf, HgiΨ and (cid:10)H †f, g(cid:11)ϕ = (cid:10)f, H †g(cid:11)ϕ, for all
f, g ∈ CN +1. Hence, even if H is not self-adjoint in H, H 6= H †, still it turns out to be self-
adjoint in a diﬀerent space, Hϕ. Similarly, H † is not self-adjoint in H, but it is self-adjoint in
HΨ.

Remarks:– (1) the equalities in (2.4) cannot be extended easily if dim(H) = ∞. The
if, for instance, X † and Sϕ are unbounded, taken f ∈ D(Sϕ), the
reason is the following:
domain of Sϕ, there is no reason a priori for Sϕf to belong to D(X †), so that X †Sϕf needs
not to be deﬁned. Moreover, even when this is true, still X †Sϕf is not necessarily a vector in
the domain of SΨ, so that the existence of SΨX †Sϕf is not granted, at least without further
assumptions. Therefore, in general, when dim(H) = ∞, the three Hilbert spaces are diﬀerent
not only topologically, but also as sets. Of course, this cannot happen if dim(H) < ∞, since
all the operators can be deﬁned in all of H.

(2) In [4], and later in [5], we have used these results in the analysis of the dynamics of a
physical system S described by some Hamiltonian with all real and discrete eigenvalues. This
analysis is motivated because, if H 6= H †, some freedom does exist in the deﬁnition of the time
evolution of S, and we have discussed a possible way to remove this freedom, using comparison
with experiments and some remarks on the functional structure of the system. We refer to
those paper for more results on these aspects.

2.2 Complex eigenvalues

From now on we will consider what happens when we abandon the assumption that Ek is
real for all k. This situation is quite interesting for concrete physical applications, both for
considering some eﬀective Hamiltonians used in diﬀerent, usually non conservative, contexts,
see for instance [8, 9] for an application to quantum optics, and for the discussion of broken
regions in PT quantum mechanics. Once again, we assume that H has N +1 distinct eigenvalues
Ek, not necessarily real, corresponding to N + 1 eigenvectors ϕk, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N:

Hϕk = Ekϕk.

(2.5)

Then Fϕ = {ϕk, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N} is automatically a basis for CN +1, admitting an unique
biorthogonal basis of H, FΨ = {Ψk, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N}: hϕk, Ψli = δk,l, for all k, l, and
k=0 |ϕk ih Ψk| = PN
PN
k=0 |Ψk ih ϕk| = 11. Moreover, H †Ψk = EkΨk for all k. Of course, for
all those eigenvalues En which are real, we recover the eigenvalue equation H †Ψn = EnΨn.

5

However, since for some n ℑ(En) 6= 0, H and H † are not isospectral and we do not expect any
intertwining relation as those in (2.2) can be established.
As before, the operators Sϕ = PN
positive, self-adjoint, invertible operators, one the inverse of the other: SΨ = S−1
again introduce the positive square roots of SΨ and Sϕ, and we have S1/2
because of the biorthogonality of Fϕ and Fψ, we ﬁnd

k=0 |Ψk ih Ψk| are bounded
ϕ . We can
. Also,

k=0 |ϕk ih ϕk| and SΨ = PN

Ψ = S−1/2

ϕ

SϕΨk = ϕk, SΨϕk = Ψk,

(2.6)

for all k. Hence, so far, there are essentially no diﬀerences with respect to what we have seen
in Section 2.1, except for the expression of eigenvalue equation for H †, which now involves Ek
rather than Ek. However, from now on, several diﬀerences appear, and the role of antilinear
operators, see Appendix, will be essential.

To begin with, we recall that if H 6= H † has only real eigenvalues, it is possible to ﬁnd a
bounded operator X, with bounded inverse, such that HX := XHX −1 is self-adjoint. Equiv-
alently, it is possible to deﬁne a new scalar product h, .iX on H in terms of which H turns
out to be self-adjoint: hHf, giX = hf, HgiX. In fact, under this reality assumption, X can be
explicitly constructed: X = S1/2
Ψ . Already in [4] we have shown that, if at least one eigenvalue
of H is complex, no such scalar product exists: H is truly non self-adjoint3! In other words,
there exists no other scalar product which makes of H a self-adjoint operator, with respect to
its own adjoint. This is reﬂected also by the fact that no X exists, admitting inverse, such that
HX := XHX −1 is self-adjoint. In fact, suppose this is not so. Then we assume for a moment
that HX = H †
X, but still a complex eigenvalue En0 exists for H. Then Hϕn0 = En0ϕn0. Now,
ˆϕn0 := Xϕn0 is a non zero eigenvector of HX, with En0 as its eigenvalue. But this is impossible,
since HX is self-adjoint.

To deal with the present situation, let us now introduce the following operators:

N

N

hf, Ψki ϕk,

VΨf =

hf, ϕki Ψk,

(2.7)

Xk=0

Vϕf =

Xk=0

for all f ∈ H. It is clear that they are both antilinear: Vϕ(α1f1 + α2f2) = α1 Vϕ(f1) + α2 Vϕ(f2)
and VΨ(α1f1 + α2f2) = α1 VΨ(f1) + α2 VΨ(f2), ∀ α1, α2 ∈ C, ∀ f1, f2 ∈ H. Moreover

V 2
ϕ = V 2

Ψ = 11.

(2.8)

3It might be relevant to stress that here we do not mean that H could be, for instance, symmetric. In this
case, in fact, under suitable conditions, we could extend H to a self-adjoint operator. This is not what we have
in mind, of course.

6

In fact, for instance, taken f ∈ H we have

N

N

V 2
ϕ f = Vϕ(Vϕf ) =

hVϕf, Ψki ϕk =

Xk=0*  N
Xl=0
Xk=0
hΨk, fi ϕk = f.
Here we have used the fact that hϕl, Ψki = δk,l and the equality PN

Xk=0
Xk,l=0
hΨl, fihϕl, Ψki ϕk =

Another useful result is that

N

=

hf, Ψli ϕl! , Ψk+ ϕk =

N

k=0 |ϕk ih Ψk| = 11.

V †
ϕ = VΨ,

(2.9)

and consequently, see Appendix, V †
Ψ = Vϕ. We refer to the Appendix also for the deﬁnition of
the adjoint of an antilinear operator, which is slightly diﬀerent from the analogous deﬁnition
for linear operators. Equation (2.9) follows from the following computation:

N

hg, Ψki ϕk! , f+ =

ϕ f, g(cid:11) = hVϕg, fi =*  N
Xk=0
Xk=0
(cid:10)V †
=*  N
hf, ϕki Ψk! , g+ = hVΨf, gi ,
Xk=0

hΨk, gihϕk, fi =

for all f, g ∈ H.

Moreover, the deﬁnitions in (2.7) imply that Vϕϕk = ϕk and VΨΨk = Ψk, for all k. If Vϕ
and VΨ were linear operators, recalling that dim(H) < ∞, these equalities would imply that
Vϕ = VΨ = 11, which, incidentally, would be in agreement with (2.8). However, see Appendix,
since Vϕ and VΨ are antilinear operators, this is not true. Hence, Vϕ and VΨ are not equal to
the identity operator. This is not surprising:
in fact, this would imply the equality between
operators of opposite nature (linear and antilinear), which is clearly never possible. This is also
what happens in connection with some intertwining equations, of the kind introduced in Section
2.1. For instance, let us consider the equality SΨH = H †SΨ in (2.2). As already stated, in the
present settings it is clear that this cannot be true, since it is not true already on vectors of Fϕ.
In fact, while SΨHϕk = EkΨk, we have H †SΨϕk = H †Ψk = EkΨk. Hence, at least for those k
labeling complex eigenvalues, SΨHϕk 6= H †SΨϕk. This fact is unpleasant, since we know that
intertwining relations as those in (2.2) can be extremely useful in concrete applications, as for
instance in the construction of new exactly solvable models, starting from a given Hamiltonian
with known eigenvectors and eigenvalues, [10, 11].

7

A possible, apparent, way out from this enpasse can be constructed, by using the operator
Vϕ introduced above. In fact, calling Hϕ := VϕH, it is clear that SΨHϕϕk = H †SΨϕk, for all
k. However, since Hϕ, and SΨHϕ as a consequence, are antilinear operators, while H †SΨ is
linear, it follows that this equality, valid for each vector of Fϕ, does not extend to all of H.
Then, SΨHϕ = H †SΨ is again false. However, it is not hard to show how, in fact, intertwining
equations holding true in all of H can be deduced. The trick is simple and consists in replacing
SΨHϕϕk = H †SΨϕk with SΨHϕϕk = H †VΨSΨϕk. This is true for all k, since both sides are
equal to EkΨk, and can be extended to all of H, since both SΨHϕ and H †VΨSΨ are antilinear
operators, now. Moreover, since H †
ϕ = H †VΨ, our new intertwining relation
becomes simply

ϕ = (VϕH)† = H †V †

SΨHϕ = H †

ϕSΨ.

(2.10)

Acting of the left and from the right of this equation with Sϕ we also get another, equivalent,
intertwining relation: HϕSϕ = SϕH †
ϕ are related by two (equivalent)
intertwining operators suggests that they are isospectral, [10, 11]. In fact, this is so: Hϕϕn =
Enϕn, while H †

ϕ. The fact that Hϕ and H †

ϕΨn = EnΨn.

Due to the fact that H and Vϕ do not commute in general, we can also consider a second
ϕ = VΨH †. Of course, in general, ˜Hϕ 6= ˜H †
antilinear operator ˜Hϕ = HVϕ, whose adjoint is ˜H †
and ˜Hϕ 6= Hϕ. Similar considerations as those discussed above for Hϕ produce the following
intertwining equations for ˜Hϕ:

ϕ

˜HϕSϕ = Sϕ ˜H †
ϕ,

˜H †

ϕSΨ = SΨ ˜Hϕ,

(2.11)

and it turns out that ˜Hϕ and its adjoint are indeed isospectrals: ˜Hϕϕn = Enϕn, and H †
EnΨn.

ϕΨn =

and ˜H0 := S1/2
Ψ

˜HϕS1/2

ϕ

Following now what we have done in Section 2.1, we can introduce the operators H0 :=
S1/2
Ψ HϕS1/2
ϕ . This can be done since both SΨ and Sϕ admit unique
positive square root. Moreover, no problem with domains arises, in the present context, since
H is ﬁnite dimensional. Of course, both these operators are antilinear. Moreover, they are both
self-adjoint: H0 = H †

0 and ˜H0 = ˜H †
0.
Ψ ϕk = S1/2
ϕ Ψk, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N, and E = {ek, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N}.
It is easy to check that these vectors are eigenstates of both H0 and H †
0: H0ek = Ek ek and
˜H0ek = Ek ek, for all k. As discussed in the Appendix, the fact that eigenvalues of a self-adjoint,
antilinear, operators can be complex should not be a surprise. On the other hand, and this was
not granted, see Appendix, the diﬀerent ek’s here are still indeed orthogonal:

Let now put ek = S1/2

hek, eni =DS1/2

Ψ ϕk, S1/2

Ψ ϕnE = hSΨϕk, ϕni = hΨk, ϕni = δk,n.

8

Hence E is an o.n. basis for H.

The intertwining relations we have deduced so far, in presence of complex eigenvalues of H,
involve antilinear operators. In fact, this seems the only way to deduce relations between some
operator related to the original Hamiltonian of the system and its adjoint. However, it is also
possible to deduce intertwining relations between linear operators. In fact, simple computations
allow us to deduce that

SΨHϕ,ϕ = H †SΨ,

(2.12)

ϕ,ϕ = HSϕ and SΨH = H †

as well as the equivalent equalities Hϕ,ϕSϕ = SϕH †, SϕH †
ϕ,ϕSΨ. Here
Hϕ,ϕ = VϕHVϕ, which is linear. Hence, these equalities all involve just linear operators. For this
reason, from one side, they might appear more interesting than those deduced before. However,
as stated, what makes (2.12) possibly less interesting for us, is that it involves not really H
and its adjoint, or Hϕ,ϕ and its adjoint, but both Hϕ,ϕ and H †. On the other hand, equation
(2.10) just involves Hϕ and its adjoint, which is closer to what usually happens in PT-quantum
mechanics and in the theory of intertwining operators.

As in Section 2.1, using Sϕ and SΨ we can introduce diﬀerent scalar products as in (2.3),
h., .iϕ and h., .iΨ, and the adjoints associated to these, ♭ and ♯, and this can be done, following the
recipe given in the Appendix, both for linear and for antilinear operators. The same relations
as those deduced in (2.4) can be deﬁned for both these kind of operators. In particular, we
deduce that

Hence, even if Hϕ and ˜Hϕ are antilinear, they still obey the same self-adjoint properties as
their linear counterparts. We will not investigate this aspect of these operators here, since
this is not relevant for what we are doing in this paper and because this does not appear to
have useful consequences, in concrete applications. Rather than this, we would like to point
out that, as it will be clear also in the next section, going from the unbroken region (UR) to
the broken region (BR) appears as a sort of phase transition: in the UR, characterized by H
having only real eigenvalues, the time evolution, for models living in ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert
spaces, is necessarily periodic or quasi-periodic, depending on the mutual ratios of the various
real eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H. No damping is possible, and the transition probabilities
appear to be also periodic or quasi-periodic in time, [4]. In the BR, in which some eigenvalues
are surely complex, the situation is completely diﬀerent, and non trivial asymptotic behaviors
can be deduced, while periodicity (or quasi-periodicity) is lost. This will be made clear in
Section 3.1.

Remark:– We should mention that the connection of pseudo-hermitian operators and anti-
linear operators, or more exactly with antilinear symmetries, has already been considered in the
context of non self-adjoint Hamiltonians by several authors, see for instance A. Mostafazadeh
in [12] and L. Solombrino in [13], but with a diﬀerent perspective with respect to ours.

3 An example

As an explicit application of our general settings we consider the following two-by-two matrix:

H =

1

2 − αβ   2E1 − αβE2 α(E2 − E1)

2β(E1 − E2) 2E2 − αβE1 ! ,

(3.1)

where α and β are real parameters such that αβ 6= 2, while E1 and E2 are, in general, complex
quantities. Of course, without further assumptions on these quantities, H 6= H †. This is the
situation we will consider here. It is easy to ﬁnd the eigenstates and the eigenvalues of H and
H †:

ϕ1 =  1

β ! , ϕ2 =  α

2 ! , Ψ1 =

1

2 − αβ   2

−α ! , Ψ2 =

With this normalization we ﬁnd that

hϕk, Ψni = δk,n,

1

2 − αβ   −β
1 !

(3.2)

(3.3)

while both hϕ1, ϕ2i and hΨ1, Ψ2i are diﬀerent from zero. Hence the two sets Fϕ = {ϕ1, ϕ2}
and FΨ = {Ψ1, Ψ2} are biorthogonal bases for H = C2: each f ∈ H can be written as
f =P2
j=1 hϕj, fi Ψj. In bra-ket language, Fϕ and FΨ produce the following
resolutions of the identity: 11 =P2

j=1 hΨj, fi ϕj =P2

j=1 |Ψj ih ϕj| =P2

j=1 |ϕj ih Ψj|.

Moreover:

Hϕj = Ejϕj,

H †Ψj = EjΨj,

(3.4)

j = 1, 2. Hence, the parameters E1 and E2 in H, see (3.1), are exactly its eigenvalues, while
their complex conjugates are the eigenvalues of H †.

It is now easy to check that Vϕ = VΨ = V , the conjugation antilinear operator acting as

follows: V   f1

f2 ! =   f1

f2 !. V is self-adjoint: V = V †, and satisﬁes, clearly, the equality

V 2 = 11, as expected.

10

In order to check the intertwining relations deduced in Section 2.2, we need ﬁrst to compute

Sϕ and SΨ, which turn out to be

Sϕ =  1 + α2 β + 2α

β + 2α 4 + β2 ! , SΨ =

1

(2 − αβ)2   4 + β2
−(β + 2α)

1 + α2 ! .
−(β + 2α)

These matrices are both manifestly self-adjoint. Moreover, they are also positive and one is the
inverse of the other: Sϕ = S−1
Ψ . Now, equalities (2.10) and (2.11) can be explicitly deduced.
The computations are not diﬃcult, and will not be given here. More interesting is to see what
is the expression of the linear operator Hϕ,ϕ = V HV in (2.12), and how this is related to the
original Hamiltonian H. In fact, it turns out that

Hϕ,ϕ =

1

2 − αβ   2E1 − αβE2 α(E2 − E1)

2β(E1 − E2) 2E2 − αβE1 ! ,

which shows that Hϕ,ϕ diﬀers from H only because each Ej is replaced by its complex con-
jugate. Of course, this means, in particular, that Hϕ,ϕ = H if E1 and E2 are real. It is now
straightforward to check all the other results and equalities discussed in Section 2.2.

It is interesting to notice that the Hamiltonian H in (3.1) is strongly related to the Hamil-

tonian

h =  reiθ

te−iΦ re−iθ ! ,

seiΦ

originally introduced in [14] in connection with P T -quantum mechanics. Moreover, it is known
that h extends a similar one, with t = s, already considered, for instance, in [15]. Notice
that in h all the parameters, r, s, t, θ and Φ, are real. Since we are interested in the so called
BR, in which the eigenvalues of h turn out to be complex conjugate, we need to require that
r2 sin2(θ) − ts > 0, which is the case we consider here. In fact, in the UR, the eigenvalues are
real, and the framework discussed in this paper is not particularly relevant.

If Φ = − π

2 , H and h coincide if we take α, β, E1 and E2 as follows:

1

s(cid:18)r sin(θ) ±qr2 sin2(θ) − ts(cid:19) , α = 2β
while, calling R = ℜ(E1) = ℜ(E2) and I = ℑ(E1) = −ℑ(E2), we put

β =

s
t

,

R = r cos(θ),

I =

2 − αβ

2α

s.

In particular we see that these formulas conﬁrm that α and β are both real. Moreover, 2 − αβ
is always non zero if s and t are non zero.

11

This simple example already shows that our general settings can be applied to models
already considered in the literature, and can be useful to study exceptional points and possible
transitions from unbroken to broken regions.

3.1 Transition probabilities

In two recent papers, [4, 5], diﬀerent deﬁnitions of the dynamics for quantum systems driven by
non-self-adjoint Hamiltonians, and consequently for transition probabilities, have been consid-
ered and compared. The possibility of considering diﬀerent deﬁnitions of transition probabilities
is of course related to the existence of various scalar products in the same Hilbert space. How-
ever, in [5] we have seen that, if the system lives in an inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space L2(R),
the appropriate choice of scalar product seems to be the standard one, hf, gi =RR f (x) g(x) dx.

Otherwise, as discussed in [5] in connection with the Swanson model, the range of the param-
eters deﬁning the original model should be restricted to keep the model well-deﬁned during its
time evolution. Driven by this idea we restrict here, for the model described by the Hamiltonian
in (3.1), to the ordinary scalar product in C2 and to the following deﬁnition of the transition
probability of going from a state Φ0 to a state Φf at time t:
PΦ0→Φf (t) = |hΦf , Φ(t)i|2
kΦfk2kΦ(t)k2

(3.5)

,

where Φ(t) = e−iHtΦ0. We will now brieﬂy discuss what happens, with this deﬁnition, when
going from the unbroken to the broken region, for a initial vector Φ0 = c1ϕ1 + c2ϕ2 and a ﬁnal
vector Φf = d1Ψ1 + d2Ψ2. Using both Fϕ and FΨ to expand the initial and the ﬁnal states is
mathematically correct (since they are both bases) and technically convenient (since they are
biorthogonal), even if it may appear not entirely natural.

Simple computations produce, ﬁrst of all,

1

kΦfk2 =

(2 − αβ)2 (cid:0)|d1|2(4 + α2) + |d2|2(1 + β2) − (α + 2β)(d1d2 + d2d1)(cid:1) ,

which does not depend on E1 and E2. Then, kΦfk2 does not change changing region, i.e. going
from the UR to the BR. On the other hand, in the UR (E1 and E2 real) we ﬁnd

and

kΦ(t)k2 = |c1|2(1 + β2) + |c2|2(4 + α2) + (α + 2β)(cid:0)c1c2ei(E1−E2)t + c1c2e−i(E1−E2)t(cid:1) ,
|hΦf , Φ(t)i|2 = |c1|2|d1|2 + |c2|2|d2|2 +(cid:0)c1c2d1d2ei(E1−E2)t + c1c2d1d2e−i(E1−E2)t(cid:1) .

12

In the BR (E1 = E2 = R + iI) these results must be replaced by the following formulas

and

kΦ(t)k2 = |c1|2(1 + β2)e2It + |c2|2(4 + α2)e−2It + (α + 2β) (c1c2 + c1c2) ,
|hΦf , Φ(t)i|2 = |c1|2|d1|2e2It + |c2|2|d2|2e−2It +(cid:0)c1c2d1d2 + c1c2d1d2(cid:1) .

It is clear that in the case of UR, only oscillations are possible, with a period T = 2π
. On
the other hand, in case of BR, no non-trivial oscillation is possible. For example, if Φ0 = ϕ1 +ϕ2
and Φf = Ψ1, in the BR we ﬁnd

E1−E2

PΦ0→Φf (t) =

(4 + α2) ((1 + β2)e2It + (4 + α2)e−2It + 2(α + 2β))

(2 − αβ)2 e2It

,

(2−αβ)2

which tends to
(4+α2)(1+β2) when t → ∞ if I > 0, or to zero if I < 0. So, as already stated, we
get two completely diﬀerent behaviors depending on the region in which our system is, broken
or unbroken4. This could be useful in some concrete application, for instance in quantum optics:
depending on the region considered we can use the same Hamiltonian to describe oscillations
or damping, which can be relevant to describe decay phenomena occurring for particular range
of values of the parameters of the model.

4 Conclusions

We have seen how the presence of complex eigenvalues in the spectrum of a given Hamiltonian
changes drastically both the mathematical settings, causing the appearance of antilinear oper-
ators, and the physical conclusions, leading to non periodic transition probabilities. We have
deduced intertwining relations similar to those already found in [4], and intertwining relations
of a diﬀerent kind, involving two diﬀerent, although related, operators.

We have also discussed the possibility of using a single underlying framework to describe real
or complex eigenvalues, and their relevance in connection with systems behaving in a diﬀerent
way depending on the values of the parameters.

Appendix: few useful facts on antilinear operators

Most of the results on operators which can be found in the literature refers to linear ones. In
this paper we have seen, however, that the set of the linear operators is not suﬃcient to deal
with Hamiltonians as the ones considered here. For this reason, also in view of the fact that
the literature on antilinear operator is not particularly reach, we have decided to list in this
appendix a set of properties of these operators which are used in the main part of this paper.
We also refer to [16] for a very recent review on this subject, and to [17] for an older, very
useful, paper.

Let H = CN +1 be our ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space, with scalar product h., .i. A map
V : H → H is said to be antilinear if V (a1ϕ1 + a2ϕ2) = a1ϕ1 + a2ϕ2, for all a1, a2 ∈ C and for
all ϕ1, ϕ2 ∈ H. We call L(H) and Lal(H) respectively the set of all the linear and of all the
antilinear operators on H.

Some facts can be easily proved:

1. If A ∈ L(H) and V ∈ Lal(H), then AV and V A are both antilinear. They act on ϕ ∈ H
as follows: (AV )ϕ = A(V ϕ), and (V A)ϕ = V (Aϕ). A + V is neither linear nor antilinear.

2. If V1, V2 ∈ Lal(H) then V1V2 ∈ L(H).
An interesting diﬀerence between linear and antilinear operators is the following: let Fϕ =
{ϕ0, . . . , ϕN} be a (not necessarily o.n.) basis for H. Let A ∈ L(H) be such that Aϕj = ϕj, for
all j. Hence, it is well known that A = 11, 11 being the identity operator on H. On the other
hand, let V ∈ Lal(H) be such that V ϕj = ϕj, for all j. Then, it is easy to see that V 6= 11.
This is, in fact, not surprising, since otherwise we would have a linear operator (11) equal to an
antilinear operator (V ). This is clearly impossible. In fact, using the deﬁnition of antilinearity,
we have V (iϕj) = −iV (ϕj) = −iϕj 6= iϕj = 11(iϕj). Hence, as stated, V must be diﬀerent
from the identity operator and, in fact, we have already introduced in Section 3 an antilinear
operator V satisfying V ϕj = ϕj, j = 1, 2, 3, but clearly diﬀerent from the identity operator.
This result is quite general: it might happen, as it happens in Section 2.2, that a linear operator
C and an antilinear operator W act in the same way on a basis Fϕ of H: Cϕj = W ϕj, for all
j. However, for the same reason which allows us to conclude that V 6= 11, this does not imply
that C = W . On the other hand, if A, C ∈ L(H) and V, W ∈ Lal(H) are such that Aϕj = Cϕj
and V ϕj = W ϕj, for all j, then A = C and V = W .

Another diﬀerence between linear and antilinear operators concerns the deﬁnition of the

adjoint.

If A ∈ L(H), it is well known that A† is deﬁned by (cid:10)A†ϕ, φ(cid:11) = hϕ, Aφi, for all

14

ϕ, φ ∈ H. On the other hand, if we try to deﬁne the adjoint of V ∈ Lal(H) in the same way,
we loose the antilinearity for V †. This is preserved adopting the following deﬁnition:

(cid:10)V †ϕ, φ(cid:11) = hϕ, V φi = hV φ, ϕi ,

(A.1)

for all ϕ, φ ∈ H. In fact, with this deﬁnition, Lal(H) turns out to be closed under adjoint: if
2 V †
V ∈ Lal(H), then V † ∈ Lal(H) as well. Notice also that (V †)† = V , and that (V1V2)† = V †
1 ,
for all V, V1, V2 ∈ Lal(H), so that the usual properties of the adjoint map are recovered also in
this case.

We say that the antilinear operator V is self-adjoint if V = V †. For linear operators,
if A = A† ∈ L(H) admits eigenvalues
this requirement has many important consequences:
λ1, λ2, . . ., these are all real. Moreover, if ψ1 and ψ2 are the eigenvectors of A corresponding
to λ1 and λ2, Aψj = λjψj, j = 1, 2, and if λ1 6= λ2, then hψ1, ψ2i = 0. Both these properties
are false for antilinear operators. For instance, let ψ be a normalized vector in H, α a ﬁxed
complex number, with ℑ(α) 6= 0, and V be the antilinear operator deﬁned as V f = αhf, ψi ψ.
Using (A.1) one can check that V is self-adjoint: V = V †. Moreover, ψ is an eigenstate of V
with complex eigenvalue α: V ψ = αψ.

Let us now introduce z1 = ei π

4 and z2 = ei π

3 , and two proportional vectors ψzj = zjψ,
It is easy to check that these two vectors are eigenstates of V corresponding to
2 (1 + i√3).

j = 1, 2.
diﬀerent eigenvalues: V ψzj = αjψzj , j = 1, 2, where α1 = −iα and α2 = − α
However, as it is clear, hψz1, ψz2i = ei π

The same conclusion can be deduced as follows5: let ψ be an eigenstate of V with complex
eigenvalue α: V ψ = αψ, let λ be a complex number with ℑ(λ) 6= 0 and let also Φ = λψ. Then

12 6= 0.

V Φ = V (λψ) = λ(V ψ) = λ(αψ) =(cid:18) λ

λ

α(cid:19) Φ.

Of course, since λ 6= λ, Φ and ψ are both eigenstates of V corresponding to diﬀerent eigenvalues.
However hψ, Φi = λkψk2 6= 0.

It is important to notice that, in both cases above example, the eigenvalues are diﬀerent
but have the same modulus. This is important. In fact, let us consider the eigenvalue equation
V ϕj = Ejϕj, j = 1, 2, for some V ∈ Lal(H), non zero ϕj ∈ H and complex quantities Ej with
|E1| 6= |E2|. Then, it is easy to check that, in this case, orthogonality is still satisﬁed: hϕ1, ϕ2i =
0. This follows from the fact that ϕj is also eigenstate of the linear, self-adjoint operator
V 2 with eigenvalue |Ej|2: V 2ϕj = V (Ejϕj) = EjV ϕj = |Ej|2ϕj, and from the assumption

5I wish to thank the Referee for suggesting me this example.

15

that |E1|2 6= |E2|2. Hence, ϕ1 and ϕ2 are also eigenstates of the self-adjoint operator V 2
corresponding to diﬀerent (real) eigenvalues; then they are orthogonal.
