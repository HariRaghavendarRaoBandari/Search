ABSTRACT

The S´ersic R1/n model is the best approximation known to date for describing the light distribution
of stellar spheroidal and disk components, with the S´ersic index n providing a direct measure of the
central radial concentration of stars. The S´ersic index of a galaxy’s spheroidal component, nsph, has
been shown to tightly correlate with the mass of the central supermassive black hole, MBH . The
MBH − nsph correlation is also expected from other two well known scaling relations involving the
spheroid luminosity, Lsph: the Lsph − nsph and the MBH − Lsph. Obtaining an accurate estimate
of the spheroid S´ersic index requires a careful modelling of a galaxy’s light distribution and some
studies have failed to recover a statistically signiﬁcant MBH − nsph correlation. With the aim of
re-investigating the MBH − nsph and other black hole mass scaling relations, we performed a detailed
(i.e. bulge, disks, bars, spiral arms, rings, halo, nucleus, etc.) decomposition of 66 galaxies, with
directly measured black hole masses, that had been imaged at 3.6 µm with Spitzer. In this paper,
the third of this series, we present an analysis of the Lsph − nsph and MBH − nsph diagrams. While
early-type (elliptical+lenticular) and late-type (spiral) galaxies split into two separate relations in
the Lsph − nsph and MBH − Lsph diagrams, they reunite into a single MBH ∝ n3.39±0.15
sequence
with relatively small intrinsic scatter ( (cid:39) 0.25 dex). The black hole mass appears to be closely
related to the spheroid central concentration of stars, which mirrors the inner gradient of the spheroid
gravitational potential.

INTRODUCTION

The empirical S´ersic (1963, 1968) R1/n model has been
demonstrated to provide adequate description of the light
distribution of the stellar spheroidal1 and disk compo-
nents of galaxies (e.g. Caon et al. 1993; Andredakis et al.
1995; Iodice et al. 1997, 1999; Seigar & James 1998;
Khosroshahi et al. 2000), yet its physical origin has re-
mained unexplained for decades. The S´ersic model pa-
rameterizes the intensity of light I as a function of the
projected galactic radius R such that

where Ie indicates the intensity at the eﬀective radius
Re that encloses half of the total light from the model,
the S´ersic index n is the parameter that regulates the
curvature of the radial light proﬁle, and bn is a constant
deﬁned in terms of the S´ersic index (see Graham & Driver
2005, and references therein). A large S´ersic index corre-
sponds to a steep inner proﬁle and a shallow outer proﬁle,
whereas a small S´ersic index corresponds to a shallow in-
ner proﬁle and a steep outer proﬁle. This means that,
for a stellar spheroidal system whose light distribution
is well approximated by the S´ersic model, the larger the
S´ersic index is, the more centrally concentrated the stars

either a disk-less elliptical galaxy or the bulge component of a
disk galaxy; we do not attempt at distinguishing between classical
bulges and disk-like pseudo-bulges.

are and the more extended the outer envelope is.
A compelling physical interpretation for the S´ersic pro-
ﬁle family was recently theorized by Cen (2014) and later
conﬁrmed by Nipoti (2015) by means of N -body simu-
lations. Cen (2014) conjectured that, when structures
form within a standard cold dark matter model seeded
by random Gaussian ﬂuctuations, any centrally concen-
trated stellar structure always possesses an extended stel-
lar envelope, and vice versa. Nipoti (2015) quantitatively
explored Cen’s hypothesis and showed that systems orig-
inated from several mergers have a large S´ersic index
(n (cid:38) 4), whereas systems with a S´ersic index as small
as n (cid:39) 2 can be produced by coherent dissipationless
collapse, and exponential proﬁles (n = 1) can only be
obtained through dissipative processes. This scenario
sets the theoretical framework for the well known cor-
relation between the spheroid luminosity, Lsph, and the
spheroid S´ersic index, nsph, (e.g. Young & Currie 1994;
Jerjen et al. 2000; Graham & Guzm´an 2003), although
the numerical results of Nipoti (2015) seem to lack of
spheroidal systems with S´ersic indices as large as 7 − 10,
which are commonly observed in the local Universe.
Given the existence of the Lsph − nsph correlation and
the relation between the central black hole mass, MBH,
and the spheroid luminosity (e.g. Kormendy & Rich-
stone 1995; Magorrian et al. 1998; Marconi & Hunt 2003;
H¨aring & Rix 2004), an MBH − nsph relation must ex-
ist. After Graham (2001) showed that the black hole
mass is tightly linked to the stellar light concentration of
spheroids (measured through a parameter diﬀerent from,
but closely related to the S´ersic index), Graham & Driver

2

Savorgnan

(2007) presented for the ﬁrst time the MBH − nsph cor-
relation using a sample of 27 elliptical and disk galax-
ies. Graham & Driver (2007) ﬁt their data with a log-
quadratic regression, ﬁnding that the MBH − nsph log-
relation is steeper for spheroids with small S´ersic in-
dices and shallower for spheroids with large S´ersic in-
dices, and measured a relatively small level of scatter2.
A few years later, Sani et al. (2011), Vika et al. (2012)
and Beiﬁori et al. (2012) performed multi-component de-
compositions for samples of galaxies similar to that used
by Graham & Driver (2007), but they failed to recover
a strong MBH − nsph relation. This issue was tackled by
Savorgnan et al. (2013), who collected the S´ersic index
measurements published by Graham & Driver (2007),
Sani et al. (2011), Vika et al. (2012) and Beiﬁori et al.
(2012) for a sample of 54 galaxies, and showed that, by
rejecting the most discrepant measurements and averag-
ing the remaining ones, a strong MBH−nsph relation was
retrieved. Remarkably, Savorgnan et al. (2013) repeated
their analysis upon excluding the S´ersic index measure-
ments of Graham & Driver (2007) and still regained a
signiﬁcant MBH − nsph correlation. This was suggesting
that the individual galaxy decompositions of Sani et al.
(2011), Vika et al. (2012) and Beiﬁori et al. (2012) were
not accurate, i.e. each individual study obtained “noisy”
S´ersic index measurements which prevented the recovery
of a strong MBH − nsph relation.
Motivated by the need for more accurate galaxy de-
compositions to reﬁne and re-investigate scaling rela-
tions between the black hole mass and several host
spheroid structural parameters, we performed state-of-
the-art modelling for the largest sample of galaxies to
date (Savorgnan & Graham 2015b, hereafter Paper I )
for which a dynamical measurement of the black hole
mass was available. In doing so, we used 3.6 µm Spitzer
satellite imagery, given its superb capability to trace the
stellar mass (Sheth et al. 2010, and references therein).
In Savorgnan et al. (2015, hereafter Paper II ) we exam-
ined the correlations between the black hole mass and the
total galaxy luminosity, the spheroid luminosity and the
spheroid stellar mass. Here we focus on the MBH − nsph
relation.

2. DATA

We populated the Lsph − nsph and MBH − nsph dia-
grams with the same galaxy sample used in Paper II
(and presented here in Table 1), i.e. 66 galaxies for which
a dynamical measurement of the black hole mass has
been reported in the literature (by Graham & Scott
2013 or Rusli et al. 2013) and for which we were able
to successfully model the light distribution and measure
the spheroid structural parameters using 3.6 µm Spitzer
satellite images. Our galaxy decompositions take into
account bulge, disks, spiral arms, bars, rings, halo, ex-
tended or unresolved nuclear source and partially de-
pleted core, and – for the ﬁrst time – they were checked
to be consistent with the galaxy kinematics (Emsellem
et al. 2011; Scott et al. 2014; Arnold et al. 2014). Kine-
matical information was used to conﬁrm the presence
of disk components in the majority of early-type (el-
2 At the time, the MBH − σ relation (Ferrarese & Merritt 2000;
Gebhardt et al. 2000) was reported to have the same level of scatter
as the MBH − nsph relation ((cid:39) 0.3 dex).

liptical + lenticular) galaxies and, more importantly,
to establish the radial extent of these disks, which in
most cases is not obvious from a visual inspection of the
galaxy images. This enabled us to distinguish between
intermediate-scale disks, that are fully embedded in the
spheroid, and large-scale disks, that encase the bulge and
dominate the light at large radii. Savorgnan & Gra-
ham (2015a) demonstrate that when an intermediate-
scale disk is misclassiﬁed and modeled as a large-scale
disk, the luminosity of the spheroid is underestimated,
hence the galaxy incorrectly appears as a positive outlier
(an “over-massive” black hole) in the MBH − Lsph dia-
gram. A detailed description of the dataset used here, the
data reduction process and the galaxy modelling tech-
nique that we developed can be found in Paper I, along
with a discussion of how we estimated the uncertainties
on the spheroid S´ersic indices3. For the present analysis,
we elected to use the spheroid S´ersic indices obtained
from the decomposition of the one-dimensional major-
axis surface brightness proﬁles of our galaxies. The mor-
phological classiﬁcation (E = elliptical; E/S0 = ellipti-
cal/lenticular; S0 = lenticular; S0/Sp = lenticular/spiral;
Sp = spiral; and “merger”) follows from the galaxy de-
compositions illustrated in Paper I. As in Paper II, we
will refer to early-type galaxies (E+S0) and late-type
galaxies (Sp). The early-type bin includes the two galax-
ies classiﬁed as E/S0, whereas the two galaxies classiﬁed
as S0/Sp and the two galaxies classiﬁed as “mergers” are
included in neither the early- nor the late-type bin.

3. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

As in Paper II, a linear regression analysis of the
Lsph − nsph (Table 3 and Figure 1) and MBH − nsph (Ta-
ble 4 and Figure 2) diagrams was performed using three
diﬀerent routines: the BCES code from Akritas & Ber-
shady (1996), the FITEXY routine (Press et al. 1992), as
modiﬁed by Tremaine et al. (2002), and the Bayesian es-
timator linmix err (Kelly 2007). All of these three rou-
tines take into account the intrinsic scatter, but only the
FITEXY and the linmix err codes allow one to quantify
it. Tremaine et al. (2002) cautioned that the BCES esti-
mator becomes ineﬀective when the dataset contains at
least one low-precision measurement – regardless of how
many high-precision measurements are in the sample –
and tends to be biased in case of low number statistics,
or if the mean square of the uncertainties associated to
the independent variable is comparable to the variance
of the distribution of the independent variable. Accord-
ing to the results from the Monte Carlo Markov Chain
simulations of Tremaine et al. (2002) and Novak et al.
(2006), these problems can be overcome with the use of
the modiﬁed FITEXY routine. Park et al. (2012) also
concluded that the modiﬁed FITEXY routine performs
better and returns less biased results than the BCES es-
timator, and noted that the the modiﬁed FITEXY rou-
tine is computationally less intensive than the Bayesian

3 The uncertainties associated with the spheroid S´ersic indices
were estimated with a method that takes into account systematic
errors. This method consists in comparing, for each of our galaxies,
the measurements of the spheroid S´ersic index obtained by other
studies with that obtained by us. Systematic errors are typically
not considered by popular 2D ﬁtting codes, which report only the
statistical errors associated with their ﬁtted parameters. Readers
should refer to Paper I for a more detailed discussion on this topic.

technique linmix err. Given that at least one of our
subsamples (the lenticular galaxies) has a small size and
that the uncertainties associated to nsph are relatively
large compared to the range spanned by the nsph values
for most of our subsamples, we put more trust in the
results obtained with the modiﬁed FITEXY routine and
throughout the text we quote only those.
We report both symmetrical and nonsymmetrical lin-
ear regressions. Symmetrical regressions are meant to
be compared with theoretical expectations, whereas non-
symmetrical forward (Y |X) regressions – which minimize
the scatter in the Y direction – allow one to predict the
value of the observable Y with the best possible preci-
sion.
We searched for extreme outliers in both the Lsph −
nsph and MBH − nsph diagrams, and found that in our
Lsph − nsph plot there are no 3σ outliers, whereas in our
MBH − nsph plot the lenticular galaxies NGC 0524 and
NGC 3998 reside more than 3σ from the bisector lin-
ear regression for all galaxies. These two galaxies have
therefore been excluded from the rest of the analysis.

3.1. Lsph − nsph

Following Graham (2001), who showed that the Lsph−
nsph relation is diﬀerent for elliptical galaxies and the
bulges of disk galaxies (S0+Sp), Savorgnan et al. (2013)
re-analyzed the data from Graham & Guzm´an (2003)
and Graham & Worley (2008) and obtained two sepa-
rate Lsph − nsph linear regressions for elliptical galax-
ies and the bulges of disk galaxies (in the B- and K-
band, respectively). At the time, the Lsph−nsph datasets
from Graham & Guzm´an (2003) and Graham & Worley
(2008) were of the best quality available to investigate
the Lsph − nsph relation for diﬀerent galaxy morpholog-
ical types. However, these datasets were not obtained
from a homogeneous analysis, but they were a collection
of results taken from various past bulge/disk decompo-
sition studies. Here we re-investigate the Lsph − nsph
diagram (Figure 1) using only our high-quality dataset.
Our spheroid luminosities and S´ersic indices were ob-
tained from accurate multicomponent decompositions,
performed in a consistent manner using the 3.6 µm band,
which is less aﬀected by dust extinction than the K-band.
Graham & Worley (2008) presented a single Lsph − nsph
correlation for the bulges of disk galaxies (S0+Sp). How-
ever, using our dataset, we ﬁt the Lsph − nsph relation
for elliptical,
lenticular and spiral galaxies separately,
and found that the values of the slope and intercept for
the lenticular galaxies are not consistent within the er-
rors with those for the spiral galaxies, but are consis-
tent within the errors with those for the elliptical galax-
ies. Given this, we conclude that in the Lsph − nsph
diagram elliptical and lenticular galaxies form together
a single (early-type) sequence, whereas the combination
of lenticular and spiral galaxies do not. According to
the modiﬁed FITEXY routine, early-type galaxies4 fol-

4 Using the BCES estimator, Savorgnan et al. (2013) re-analyzed
the dataset from Graham & Guzm´an (2003) and obtained Lsph ∝
n3.60±0.19
for the elliptical galaxies only. This result is in excel-
lent agreement with the BCES linear regression obtained here for
the early-type galaxies (Lsph ∝ n3.89±0.42
) and, remarkably, it is
exactly the same proportionality obtained here for the early-type
galaxies with the modiﬁed FITEXY routine.

Because the log-slopes of the correlations for early- and
late-type galaxies are not consistent with each other
within their 1σ uncertainties, our quantitative linear re-
gression analysis suggests that the Lsph − nsph diagram
is better described with a four-parameter model (two
separate power-laws) rather than with a two-parameter
model (single power-law). In addition, the relative qual-
ity of these two statistical models can be independently
assessed using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC,
Akaike 1974). AIC is a trade-oﬀ between the statisti-
cal signiﬁcance of a ﬁt and the complexity of the model
used. It beneﬁts from the goodness of a ﬁt, but at the
same time is also penalized by the number of parame-
ters of the model, hence it discourages overﬁtting. The
AICc is a variation of the AIC that takes into account
a correction for ﬁnite sample sizes:

AICc = 2k − 2 ln(L) +

2k(k + 1)
n − k − 1

,

(1)

where k is the number of parameter of the model, n is the
sample size, and L is the maximum value of the likelihood
function for the model. Within a set of candidate models
for a given dataset, the best model has the smallest AICc
value. Using our Lsph − nsph dataset, the AICc value for
a double power-law model is a factor of 3/4 smaller than
the AICc value for a single power-law model.

3.2. MBH − nsph

Graham & Scott (2013) presented two diﬀerent MBH−
Lsph relations for S´ersic and core-S´ersic spheroids5 (Gra-
ham et al. 2003; Trujillo et al. 2004). However, in Paper
II we found that the slopes of the MBH−Lsph correlations
for S´ersic and core-S´ersic spheroids are consistent with
each other within their 1σ uncertainties, which prevented
us from considering them as two separate sequences. On
the other hand, our analysis showed that early- and late-
type galaxies follow two diﬀerent MBH − Lsph relations.
Given that early- and late-type galaxies deﬁne two sepa-
rate sequences in both the Lsph − nsph and MBH − Lsph
diagrams, we investigate substructure in the MBH − nsph
diagram. Using the results from the modiﬁed FITEXY
routine, we know that the early-type galaxies follow
MBH ∝ L1.03±0.11
, therefore we ex-
pect to ﬁnd MBH ∝ n3.69±0.44
; this prediction is in excel-
lent agreement with the observed log-slope of 3.58± 0.27
obtained here. On the other hand, late-type galaxies fol-
low MBH ∝ L2.58±1.06
, from which
one can predict MBH ∝ n3.72±2.03
; this is consistent with
the observed log-slope of 4.55 ± 0.66. The Bayesian esti-
mator linmix err returns consistent results: a log-slope
of 3.44 ± 0.33 for the early-type galaxies and a log-slope
of 4.12±1.07 for the late-type galaxies. Regardless of the
linear regression routine used, the values of the slope and
intercept for the early- and late-type galaxies are consis-
tent with each other within their 1σ uncertainties6. Our

single power-law, whereas they follow two diﬀerent cor-
relations in the MBH− Lsph diagram (Paper II ). We now
want to compare the amount of intrinsic scatter in these
two plots.
In Table 5 we report the values of the in-
trinsic scatter in the MBH − nsph and MBH − Lsph di-
agrams for all, early- and late-type galaxies, obtained
with the modiﬁed FITEXY routine and the Bayesian es-
timator linmix err. When considering all galaxies, irre-
spective of their morphological type, the intrinsic scatter
of the MBH − nsph relation is smaller than that of the
MBH − Lsph relation. However, this is obviously not a
fair comparison, because of the diﬀerent nature of the
MBH − nsph and MBH − Lsph correlations (single and
double power-law, respectively). One can obtain more
informative results by considering early- and late-type
galaxies separately. For the early-type galaxies, the in-
trinsic scatter of the MBH − nsph relation is consistent7
with that of the MBH − Lsph relation (within their 1σ
uncertainties). For the late-type galaxies, the intrinsic
scatter of the MBH− nsph relation is consistent with that
of the MBH − Lsph relation, except for the inverse (X|Y )
regression obtained with the modiﬁed FITEXY routine.
In passing, we note that the values of the intrinsic scatter
of the MBH − nsph relation are systematically smaller –
although consistent within the errors – than the corre-
sponding values of the intrinsic scatter of the MBH−Lsph
relation. In addition, the values of the intrinsic scatter
returned by the modiﬁed FITEXY routine are systemat-
ically smaller than those output by the Bayesian estima-
tor linmix err.

4. CONCLUSIONS

The S´ersic index of a galaxy’s spheroidal component,
nsph, constitutes a direct measure of its central radial
concentration of stars. After Graham (2001) proved that
the central black hole mass, MBH, correlates with the
stellar light concentration of a galaxy’s spheroidal com-
ponent, Graham & Driver (2007) presented and analyzed
for the ﬁrst time a tight MBH − nsph correlation us-
ing a sample of 27 elliptical and disk galaxies for which
they had performed photometric bulge/disk decomposi-
tion. The MBH − nsph correlation can be predicted from
the combination of two well known scaling relations in-
volving the spheroid luminosity, Lsph: the MBH − Lsph
(e.g. Kormendy & Richstone 1995; Magorrian et al. 1998;
Marconi & Hunt 2003; H¨aring & Rix 2004) and the
Lsph − nsph (e.g. Young & Currie 1994; Jerjen et al.
2000; Graham & Guzm´an 2003). However, upon inde-
pendently attempting photometric multicomponent de-
compositions for galaxy samples that were similar to that
used by Graham & Driver (2007), three subsequent stud-
ies (Sani et al. 2011; Vika et al. 2012; Beiﬁori et al. 2012)
failed to recover a statistically signiﬁcant MBH − nsph re-
lation. Savorgnan et al. (2013) collected and compared
the S´ersic index measurements obtained by Graham &
Driver (2007), Sani et al. (2011), Vika et al. (2012) and
Beiﬁori et al. (2012), and argued that the discrepancies
were due to inaccurate galaxy decompositions.
Moved by a urgent need to re-investigate and reﬁne

7 Looking at the results obtained with the modiﬁed FITEXY
routine, the values of the intrinsic scatter are only marginally con-
sistent with each other, but looking at the results obtained with the
Bayesian estimator linmix err, the values of the intrinsic scatter
are fully consistent with each other.

the 17 late-type (Sp) galaxies, with the blue shaded area denoting
its 1σ uncertainty. The error bars in the bottom panel have the
same color coding as the symbols in the top panel.

analysis shows that the early- and late-type galaxies do
not follow two separate trends in the MBH − nsph dia-
gram, i.e. we do not identify any signiﬁcant substructure
based on the galaxy morphological type. The AICc value
for a single power-law model is a factor of 2/3 smaller
than the AICc value for a double power-law model.
The symmetrical linear regression for all galaxies ob-
tained with the modiﬁed FITEXY routine is:

We carefully measured the S´ersic index of each galaxy’s
spheroidal component and estimated its associated un-
certainty with a method that takes into account statisti-
cal and systematic errors. Our analysis shows that early-
(elliptical + lenticular) and late-type (spiral) galaxies
deﬁne two diﬀerent correlations in the Lsph − nsph di-
agram, whereas they reunite in a single sequence in the
MBH − nsph diagram. With the current dataset, we mea-
sured an amount of intrinsic scatter in the MBH−nsph di-
agram systematically smaller, but still consistent within
the errors, with that observed in the the MBH − Lsph
diagram (Paper II ).
Our results suggest that the black hole mass is intimately
connected to the spheroid central concentration of stars,
which reﬂects the inner gradient of the spheroid gravita-
tional potential. Besides conferring the spheroid S´ersic
index a predictive power to infer the black hole mass
from a galaxy’s image only (even photometrically un-
calibrated), the MBH − nsph correlation should become a
fundamental ingredient in semi-analytic models and sim-
ulations of galaxy formation.

from the linear regression analysis (see Section 3). Both the early- and late-type subsamples do not contain the two galaxies classiﬁed as
S0/Sp and the two galaxies classiﬁed as mergers (45+17=66-2-2).
