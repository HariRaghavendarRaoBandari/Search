We provide an evidence for the validity of strong monogamy inequality of multi-party quantum
entanglement using square of convex-roof extended negativity(SCREN). We ﬁrst consider a large
class of multi-qudit mixed state that are in a partially coherent superposition of a generalized W-
class state and the vacuum, and provide some useful properties about this class of states. We show
that monogamy inequality of multi-qudit entanglement in terms of SCREN holds for this class of
states. We further show that SCREN strong monogamy inequality of multi-qudit entanglement also
holds for this class of states. Thus SCREN is a good alternative to characterize the monogamous
and strongly monogamous properties of multi-qudit entanglement.

INTRODUCTION

Whereas classical correlation can be freely shared in
multi-party systems, quantum entanglement is known to
have restriction in its shareability. This restricted share-
ability of entanglement in multi-party quantum systems
is known as monogamy of entanglement (MOE) [1, 2].

Mathematically, MOE was ﬁrst characterized as an
inequality in three-qubit systems by Coﬀman-Kundu-
Wootters(CKW) [3]. Using tangle as bipartite entangle-
ment quantiﬁcation, CKW inequality shows the mutu-
ally exclusive nature of two-qubit entanglement shared
in three-qubit systems. Later, three-qubit CKW inequal-
ity was generalized for arbitrary multi-qubit systems [4]
as well as some cases of higher-dimensional quantum
systems [5–8]. A general monogamy inequality of arbi-
trary quantum systems was established in terms of the
squashed entanglement [9, 10].

In three-qubit systems, the residual entanglement from
the diﬀerence between left and right-hand sides of CKW
inequality is interpreted as the genuine three-qubit entan-
glement, which is referred to as three-tangle [11]. Later,
the deﬁnition of three-tangle was generalized into multi-
qubit systems, namely n-tangle, and the concept of strong
monogamy(SM) inequality of multi-qubit entanglement
was proposed by conjecturing the nonnegativity of the
n-tangle [12].

To support multi-qubit SM inequality, an extensive nu-
merical evidence was presented for four qubit systems as
well as an analytical proof for some cases of multi-qubit
systems [12, 13]. However, it is known that tangle fails in
the generalization of CKW inequality for higher dimen-
sional quantum systems due to the existence of coun-
terexamples [14, 15]. Because multi-qubit SM inequal-
ity in terms of tangle is reduced to the CKW inequality

in three-party quantum systems, the existence of coun-
terexamples of CKW inequality also implies the violation
of SM monogamy inequality based on tangle in higher-
dimensional quantum systems more that qubits.

Recently,

square of convex-roof extended negativ-
ity(SCREN) was proposed to characterize the strongly
monogamous property of multi-party quantum entangle-
ment even in higher-dimensional quantum systems [16].
Besides its coincidence with tangle in qubit systems,
which can rephrase the multi-qubit SM inequality in
terms of SCREN, SCREN SM inequality was shown to
be true for the counterexamples of tangle in higher-
dimensional systems. It was also analytically shown that
SCREN SM inequality is true for a large class of multi-
qudit generalized W-class states [16]. Thus, SCREN is
a good alternative for strong monogamy of multi-party
quantum entanglement even in higher-dimensional sys-
tems.

Here we provide another evidence for the validity of
SCREN SM inequality of multi-qudit entanglement. We
ﬁrst consider a large class of multi-qudit mixed state
that are in a partially coherent superposition of a gen-
eralized W-class state and the vacuum. After provid-
ing some useful properties about the structure of par-
tially coherently superposed states, we show that CKW-
type monogamy inequality holds for this class of states
in terms of SCREN. We further show that SCREN SM
inequality is true for this class of states, which is, we be-
lieve, the ﬁrst result where strong monogamy inequality
is studied for multi-qudit mixed states.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we re-
view the deﬁnition of tangle and SCREN, and their re-
lation in monogamy inequality of multi-party quantum
entanglement. In Sec. III, we recall the multi-qubit SM
inequality in terms of tangle, as well as the multi-qudit
SCREN SM inequality. In Sec. IV, we provide the deﬁ-
nition of partially coherent superposition of multi-qudit
generalized W-class states and vacuum as well as some
useful properties about this class of states. In Sec. V, we
show that CKW-type monogamy inequality in terms of

SCREN is saturated by partially coherently superposed
states. In Sec. VI, we show that the SCREN SM inequal-
ity of multi-qudit entanglement is saturated by partially
coherently superposed states, and we summarize our re-
sults in Sec. VII.

where |φiABhφ|TB is the partial transposition of |φiAB

Here, we note that for any two-qubit pure state |ψiAB

II. MONOGAMY OF MULTI-PARTY

QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT

For a two-qubit pure state |ψiAB, its tangle (or one-

tangle) is deﬁned as

τ(cid:16)|ψiA|B(cid:17) = 4 det ρA,

(1)

with the reduced density matrix ρA = trB|ψiABhψ| [17].
For a two-qubit mixed state ρAB,
its tangle (or two-
tangle) is deﬁned as

τ(cid:0)ρA|B(cid:1) =(cid:20) min

{ph,|ψhi}Xh

phqτ (|ψhiA|B)(cid:21)2

,

(2)

where the minimization is taken over all possible pure
state decompositions

ρAB =Xh

ph|ψhiABhψh|.

(3)

By using one and two-tangles, three-qubit CKW in-

equality was proposed as

τ(cid:16)|ψiA|BC(cid:17) ≥ τ(cid:0)ρA|B(cid:1) + τ(cid:0)ρA|C(cid:1) ,

for any three-qubit pure state |ψiABC with two-qubit re-
duced density matrices ρAB = trC|ψiABChφ| and ρAC =
trB|ψiABChφ|. Later CKW inequality in (4) was gener-
alized into multi-qubit systems [4] as

n

τ(cid:0)ρA1|Aj(cid:1) ,

(5)

τ(cid:16)|ψiA1|A2···An(cid:17) ≥

Xj=2
for any n-qubit state |ψiA1A2···An
and its two-qubit re-
duced density matrices ρA1Aj on subsystems A1Aj for
each j = 2,··· , n.
Although tangle is a good bipartite entanglement mea-
sure, which also shows the monogamy inequality of multi-
qubit entanglement, there exist quantum states in higher
dimensions violating CKW inequality, in 3 ⊗ 3 ⊗ 3 and
even in 3 ⊗ 2 ⊗ 2 quantum systems [14, 15]. Thus, tan-
gle itself fails in its generalization of CKW inequality for
higher dimensional quantum systems more than qubits.
Another generalization of two-qubit tangle into higher-
dimensional quantum systems is using negativity; for any
bipartite pure state |φiAB, its negativity is deﬁned as

N (|φiA|B) =(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)|φiABhφ|TB(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)1 − 1

(6)

|ψiAB =pλ1|e0iA ⊗ |f0iB +pλ2|e1iA ⊗ |f1iB,

the square of negativity coincides with the tangle,

N 2(cid:16)|ψiA|B(cid:17) = 4λ1λ2 = τ(cid:16)|ψiA|B(cid:17) .

(7)

(8)

Thus the two-tangle of any two-qubit state ρAB in Eq. (2)
can be rephrased as

τ(cid:0)ρA|B(cid:1) =(cid:20) min

{ph,|ψhi}Xh

phN (cid:16)|ψhiA|B(cid:17)(cid:21)2

.

(9)

Based on this relation, another generalization of two-
qubit tangle into higher-dimensional quantum systems
was proposed as

Nsc(ρA|B) =(cid:20) min

{ph,|ψhi}Xh

phN (cid:16)|ψhiA|B(cid:17)(cid:21)2

,

(10)

for any bipartite mixed state ρAB where the minimization
is over all pure-state decompositions of ρAB. The quan-
tity in Eq. (10) is referred to as square of convex-roof
extended negativity(SCREN), which is a faithful bipar-
tite entanglement measure [16, 21–23].

Consequently, the multi-qubit CKW inequality in (5)

Nsc(cid:16)|ψiA1|A2···An(cid:17) ≥

n

Xj=2

Nsc(cid:0)ρA1|Aj(cid:1) .

(11)

Moreover, Inequality (11) is still true for the counterex-
amples violating CKW inequality in terms of tangle [16].
Thus SCREN is a good alternative for monogamy in-
equality of multi-qubit entanglement without any known
counterexamples even in higher-dimensional quantum
systems so far.

III. STRONG MONOGAMY OF MULTI-PARTY

QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT

In three-qubit systems, the residual entanglement from
the diﬀerence between left and right-hand sides of CKW
Inequality (4) is referred to as three-tangle,

τ(cid:16)|ψiA|B|C(cid:17) = τ(cid:16)|ψiA|BC(cid:17)−τ(cid:0)ρA|B(cid:1)−τ(cid:0)ρA|C(cid:1) , (12)

which is invariant under the permutation of subsys-
tems [11]. This deﬁnition of three-tangle was recently
generalized for multi-qubit systems [12]; n-tangle of an

(4)

can be rephrased in terms of SCRENs as,

n-qubit pure state |ψiA1A2···An
τ(cid:16)|ψiA1|A2|···|An(cid:17) =τ(cid:16)|ψiA1|A2···An(cid:17)

(15)

For n = 3, the deﬁnition of n-tangle in Eq. (13) reduces
to that of three-tangle in Eq. (12). n-tangle also reduces
to the two-tangle of two-qubit state ρA1A2 in Eq. (2) for
n = 2.

By conjecturing nonnegativity of n-tangle, a strong
monogamy(SM) inequality of multi-qubit entanglement
was proposed as

τ(cid:16)|ψiA1|A2···An(cid:17) ≥

n−1

Xm=2X~jm

τ(cid:16)ρA1|Ajm

(16)

Inequality (16) encapsulates three-qubit CKW inequal-
ity in (4) for n = 3, therefore, it is another generalization
of three-qubit monogamy inequality into multi-qubit sys-
tems in a stronger form [24].

Whereas SM inequality in (16) proposes a stronger
monogamous property of multi-qubit entanglement with
extensive numerical evidences as well as an analytic proof
for some class of of multi-qubit states [13], Inequality (16)
is no longer valid for higher-dimensional quantum sys-
tems more than qubits due to the existence of counterex-
amples [14, 15]. In other words, n-tangle fails in its gen-
eralization for SM inequality in higher-dimensional sys-
tems.

Based on the coincidence of tangle and SCREN in
two-qubit systems, another generalization of multi-qubit
SM inequality into higher-dimensional quantum systems
was recently proposed [16];
for an n-qudit pure state

Moreover, SCREN SM inequality of multi-party entan-
glement is then proposed as

Nsc(cid:16)|ψiA1|A2···An(cid:17) ≥

n−1

Xm=2X~jm

Nsc(cid:16)ρA1|Ajm

1

|···|Ajm

m−1(cid:17)m/2

,

(18)

by conjecturing the nonnegativity of n-SCREN in
Eq. (17).

Due to the coincidence of tangle and SCREN in qubit
systems, SCREN SM Inequality in (18) is reduced to
tangle-based SM Inequality in (16) for any multi-qubit
states. Thus Inequality (18) is valid for the classes of
multi-qubit quantum states considered in [12, 13]. More-
over, it was recently shown that SCREN SM inequality
is still true for a large class of multi-qudit generalized
W-class states as well as the counterexamples of CKW
inequality in higer-dimensional quantum systems [16].
Thus SCREN is a good alternative of tangle in char-
acterizing strongly monogamous property of multi-party
quantum entanglement.

IV. PARTIALLY COHERENT SUPERPOSITION

OF MULTI-QUDIT GENERALIZED W-CLASS

STATES AND VACUUM

Let us ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of multi-qudit gener-
alized W-class state [15]; an n-qudit generalized W-class
state is deﬁned as

d−1

=

(cid:12)(cid:12)W d
n(cid:11)A1···An

Xj=1
(a1j|j0 ··· 0i + a2j|0j ··· 0i

+ ··· + anj|00 ··· 0ji),

(19)

for some orthonormal basis {|jiAi}d−1
j=0 of qudit subsys-
tems Ai with i = 1,··· , n and the normalization condi-
tion Pn
A partially coherent superposition(PCS) of an n-qudit
generalized W-class state and the vacuum |0i⊗n is a two-
parameter class of n-qudit states,

j=1 |aij|2 = 1 [25].

i=1Pd−1

ρ(p, λ)
A1···An

n(cid:12)(cid:12) + (1 − p)|0i⊗nh0|⊗n

=p(cid:12)(cid:12)W d
n(cid:11)(cid:10)W d
+ λpp(1 − p)(cid:16)(cid:12)(cid:12)W d

n(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:17) ,
n(cid:11)h0|⊗n + |0i⊗n(cid:10)W d

(20)

where 0 ≤ p, λ ≤ 1 [5]. Here λ is the degree of coherency;
ρ(p, λ)
in Eq. (20) becomes a coherent superposition of
A1···An
a generalized W-class state and vacuum,

(21)

(22)

= √p(cid:12)(cid:12)W d
n(cid:11)(cid:10)W d

|ψiA1,···An

n(cid:11) +p1 − p|0i⊗n,

for the case that λ = 1, and it is an incoherent superpo-
sition, or a mixture

ρA1,···An = p(cid:12)(cid:12)W d

n(cid:12)(cid:12) + (1 − p)|0i⊗nh0|⊗n

when λ = 0. For the intermediate value of λ between 0
and 1, the superposition coherency of ρ(p, λ)
is partial,
and thus partially coherent superposition.

A1···An

The PCS state in Eq. (20) can also be interpreted by
means of decoherence; ρ(p, λ)
is the resulting state from
a coherent superposition of a generalized W-class state
and |0i⊗n in Eq. (21) after the decoherence process so-
called phase damping [26], which can be represented as

A1···An

ρA1···An = Λ(|ψihψ|)
= E0|ψihψ|E†

0 + E1|ψihψ|E†

1 + E2|ψihψ|E†
2,
(23)
with Kraus operators E0 = √λI, E1 = √1 − λ(I−|0ih0|)
and E2 = √1 − λ|0ih0|. Thus the PCS state in Eq. (20)

naturally arises by the eﬀect of decoherence.

Before we further investigate the monogamous prop-
erty of PCS states in Eq. (20), we provide some useful
properties of the generalized W-class states as well as
PCS states.

Theorem 1. The n-qudit generalized W-class state in
Eq. (19) can be considered as a (n − 1)-party generalized
W-class state in higher-dimensional quantum systems.
Proof. Let us ﬁrst consider each of the ﬁrst (n− 2)-qudit
··· An−2 as a d-dimensional quan-
subsystems A1, A2,
tum system embedded in higher-dimensional system Bi
with dimension d2 [27],

Ai ⊆ Bi ∼= Cd2

, i = 1,··· , n − 2,

(24)

and the last two-qudit systems An−1 ⊗ An as a single
system Bn−1 with dimension d2,

4

for j = 0,··· , d − 1.
Now the n-qudit generalized W-class state in Eq. (19)
can be rewritten as a (n − 1)-party generalized W-class
state

W d2

n−1EB1···Bn−1

=

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

d2−1

Xj=1

(b1j|j0 ··· 0i + b2j|0j ··· 0i

+ ··· + b(n−1)j|00 ··· 0ji),

(27)

with the coeﬃcients bij deﬁned as

bij = aij f or i = 1,··· n − 2,
b(n−1)jd =a(n−1)j, b(n−1)j = anj,

(28)

for j = 0,··· , d − 1, and zero elsewhere.

The proof of Theorem 1 deals with the case when the
lase two-qudit system An−1 ⊗ An is considered as a com-
bined single system. However, we can also analogously
show that the choice two-qudit system can be arbitrary
among A1,··· , An. Moreover, we can iteratively use
Theorem 1 to obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 1. For a partition P = {P1, . . . , Pm}, m ≤ n
of the set of subsystems S = {A1, . . . , An}, the n-qudit
generalized W-class state in Eq. (19) can be consid-
ered as a m-party generalized W-class state in higher-
dimensional quantum systems.

Proof. Let us assume that each party Ps contains ns
number of qudit subsystems for s = 1,··· , m with
Pm
s=1 ns = n. For each ns-qudit subsystems of the party
Ps, we use the argument in the proof of Theorem 1 it-
eratively to obtain a single system Bs. After renaming
the basis elements and the coeﬃcients analogously as in
Eqs. (26) and (28), the n-qubit generalized W-class state
in Eq. (19) can be rewritten as a m-party generalized
W-class state

W dmax

m EB1···Bm

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

dmax−1

Xj=1

(b1j|j0 ··· 0i + b2j|0j ··· 0i

+ ··· + bmj|00 ··· 0ji), (29)

nmax := max

s {ns}, dmax := dnmax.

(30)

Corollary 1 shows that the generalized W-class state
in Eq. (19) preserves its structure with respect to an ar-
bitrary partition of subsystems. Furthermore, the deﬁni-
tion of PCS state in Eq. (20) together with Corollary 1
naturally lead us to the following corollary.
Corollary 2. For a partition P = {P1, . . . , Pm}, m ≤ n
of the set of subsystems S = {A1, . . . , An}, the n-qudit
PCS state in Eq. (20) can be considered as a m-party
PCS state in higher-dimensional quantum systems.

An−1 ⊗ An = Bn−1 ∼= Cd2

.

where

(25)

For each i = 1, 2,··· , n − 2, we can extend the or-
thonormal basis {|jiAi}d−1
j=0 of subsystem Ai to obtain an
orthonormal basis of Bi, {|jiBi}d2−1
j=0 , where each |jiAi
is embedded to |jiBi
for j = 0,··· , d − 1. For the last
two-qudit systems An−1 ⊗ An with an orthonormal basis
{|jiAn−1 ⊗|kiAn}d−1
j,k=0, we rename these basis element by
using the decimal system to obtain an orthonormal basis
{|jiBn−1}d2−1

j=0 with the following relation

|jiBn−1 =|0iAn−1 ⊗ |jiAn
|jdiBn−1 =|jiAn−1 ⊗ |0iAn

,

(26)

Now we provide another useful property about the PCS

states.

Lemma 2. Let ρ(p, λ)
be a partially coherent superpo-
A1···An
sition of a generalized W-class state and the vacuum in
Eq. (20). Then the reduced density matrix of ρ(p, λ)
,
A1···An
obtained by tracing out some subsystems,
is again a
partially coherent superposition of a generalized W-class
state and the vacuum in the reduced systems.

5

Proof. Due to an inductive argument, it is enough to
show the case when a single-qudit subsystem is traced
out from ρ(p, λ)
. Without loss of generality, we consider
the case when the last qudit subsystem An is traced out.

From a straightforward calculation, we obtain the re-

duced density matrix ρA1···An−1 = trAn(cid:16)ρ(p, λ)

From Eq. (33) together with Eqs. (35) and (37), the re-
duced density matrix in Eq. (31) can be rewritten as

(38)

which is a partially coherent superposition of an (n− 1)-
qudit W-class state (cid:12)(cid:12)W d
n−1(cid:11) and the vacuum with new
parameters p′ and λ′.
Here we note that p′ = pΩ ≤ p as 0 ≤ Ω ≤ 1, therefore
Eq. (37) implies that λ′ ≤ λ. In other words, the param-
eter of coherency λ is not increasing as we trace out some
subsystems from ρ(p,λ)

V. SCREN MONOGAMY INEQUALITY FOR

PARTIALLY COHERENTLY SUPERPOSED

STATES

In this section, we show that multi-party SCREN
monogamy inequality in (11) is true for multi-qudit PCS
states in Eq. (20). We ﬁrst recall a useful property about
unitary freedom in the ensemble for density matrices pro-
vided by Hughston, Jozsa and Wootters(HJW) [28].
Proposition 1. (HJW Theorem) The sets {| ˜φii} and
{| ˜ψji} of (possibly unnormalized) states generate the
same density matrix if and only if

| ˜φii =Xj

uij| ˜ψji

(39)

where (uij) is a unitary matrix of complex numbers, with
indices i and j, and we pad whichever set of states {| ˜φii}
or {| ˜ψji} is smaller with additional zero vectors so that
the two sets have the same number of elements.

Consequently, Proposition 1 implies that for two pure-

they represent the same density matrix, that is ρ =

state decompositions Pi pi|φiihφi| and Pj qj|ψjihψj|,
Pi pi|φiihφi| = Pj qj|ψjihψj| if and only if √pi|φii =
Pj uij√qj|ψji for some unitary matrix uij.

have

duced density matrix ρA1|Aj for j = 2,··· , n.
Proof. We use mathematical induction on the number of
subsystems n, and ﬁrst show the saturation of SCREN

we need to consider the minimization over all possible

we note that the PCS state in Eq. (41) can be rewritten
as

A1A2A3 = |˜xiA1A2A3h˜x| + |˜yiA1A2A3h˜y|.

therefore the average of the square-root of two-SCRENs

the two-qudit reduced density matrix ρA1A2 in Eq. (51)
can be rewritten as

| ˜ψhiA1A2 = vh1|˜ηiA1A2 + vh2| ˜ξiA1A2,

Similar to the case of Nsc(cid:16)ρ(p, λ)

A1A2A3(cid:17), we note that the

average in Eq. (57) does not depend on the choice of pure
state decomposition of ρA1A2. Thus the two-SCREN of

(59)

From Eq. (50) together with Eqs. (58) and (59) we have

Nsc(cid:16)ρ(p, λ)

A1|A2A3(cid:17) = Nsc(cid:0)ρA1|A2(cid:1) + Nsc(cid:0)ρA1|A3(cid:1)

for any three-qudit PCS state ρ(p, λ)

A1A2A3.

(60)

Now we assume the induction hypothesis, that is,
Eq. (40) is true for any (n − 1)-qudit PCS state, and
show the validity of Eq. (40) for n-qudit PCS states.
From Corollary 2, we note that the n-qudit PCS state
in Eq. (20) can be considered as a (n − 1)-party PCS
state in higher-dimensional quantum system where the
last two-qudit subsystem An−1 ⊗ An is considered as a
single subsystem.

Due to the induction hypothesis, we have

n−2

Xj=2

A1|A2···An(cid:17) =

Nsc(cid:16)ρ(p, λ)
Nsc(cid:0)ρA1|Aj(cid:1)+Nsc(cid:0)ρA1|An−1An(cid:1) ,
where Nsc(cid:0)ρA1|An−1An(cid:1) is the two-SCREN of the three-

qudit reduced density matrix ρA1An−1An with respect
to the bipartition between A1 and An−1An. Moreover,
Lemma 2 implies that the three-qudit reduced density
matrix ρA1An−1An is a three-qudit PCS state. Thus our
induction hypothesis assures that

(61)

Nsc(cid:0)ρA1|An−1An(cid:1) = Nsc(cid:0)ρA1|An−1(cid:1) + Nsc(cid:0)ρA1|An(cid:1) .

(62)
Now Eq. (61) together with Eq. (62) complete the proof.

For the case when λ = 1, the PCS state ρ(p,λ)

A1A2···An
in Eq. (20) is reduced to a coherently superposed
state |ψiA1,···An
in Eq. (21) where its saturation of the
monogamy inequality in terms of SCREN was provided
as a result in [16]. Thus Theorem 3 encapsulates the
result of

[16].

VI. SCREN STRONG MONOGAMY

INEQUALITY FOR PARTIALLY COHERENTLY

SUPERPOSED STATES

Now we show the validity of SCREN SM inequality
in (18) for PCS states in Eq. (20). We ﬁrst note that

8

for the case when λ = 1, ρ(p, λ)
becomes the coherent
superposition of an n-qudit generalized W-class state and
vacuum in Eq. (21) where the saturation of SCREN SM
inequality for this case was already provided in [16].

A1···An

Proposition 2. For the class of n-qudit states that is a
coherent superposition of an n-qudit generalized W-class
state and the vacuum,

|ψiA1,···An

n(cid:11) +p1 − p|0i⊗n,

SCREN SM inequality of entanglement is saturated;

Nsc(cid:16)|ψiA1|A2···An(cid:17) =

|···|Ajm

(63)

Thus our new result derived below encapsulates the
result in [16] as a special case. To generalize Proposition 2
for arbitrary PCS states, we ﬁrst provide the following
theorem.

Theorem 4. For the PCS state in Eq. (20),
SCREN is zero,

its n-

Nsc(cid:16)ρ(p, λ)

A1|A2|···|An(cid:17) = 0.

(64)

Proof. From the deﬁnition of the mixed state n-SCREN,
we have

A1|A2|···|An(cid:17) =
Nsc(cid:16)ρ(p, λ)
(cid:20) min
{ph,|ψhi}Xh

phrNsc(cid:16)|ψhiA1|A2|···|An(cid:17)(cid:21)2

,

(65)

where the minimization is over all possible pure-state de-
compositions of

ρ(p, λ)
A1A2···An

=Xh

|ψhiA1A2···Anhψh|.

(66)

Let us consider two unnnormalized states in an n-qudit

system

|˜ηi =√p(cid:12)(cid:12)W d
n(cid:11) + λp1 − p|0i⊗n,
| ˜ξi =p(1 − p)(1 − λ2)|0i⊗n,
n(cid:11) is the n-qudit W-class state and |0i⊗n is

the vacuum. Then the PCS state in Eq. (20) can be
represented as

where (cid:12)(cid:12)W d

(67)

ρ(p, λ)
A1A2···An

(68)

From the HJW theorem in Proposition 1, any pure
h=1 | ˜ψhih ˜ψh| of

state decomposition of ρ(p, λ)

= |˜ηih˜η| + | ˜ξih ˜ξ|.
= Pr

A1A2···An

size r can be realized by some choice of an r × r unitary
matrix (uij) such that
| ˜ψhi =uh1|˜ηi + uh2| ˜ξi
=uh1√p(cid:12)(cid:12)W d
n(cid:11)
+(cid:16)uh1λp1 − p + uh2p(1 − p)(1 − λ2)(cid:17)|0i⊗n.
By considering the normalization | ˜ψhi = √ph|ψhi with
ph =D ˜ψh| ˜ψhE for each h, we have

(69)

r

ρ(p, λ)
A1A2···An

=

ph|ψhihψh|.

Xh=1

(70)

Because | ˜ψhi in Eq. (69) is a coherent superposition of
an n-qudit W-class state and vacuum, so is its normalized
state |ψhi in Eq. (70).
In other words, any pure state
appears in any pure-state decomposition of ρ(p, λ)
is
a coherent superposition an n-qudit W-class state and
vacuum. Thus Proposition 2 assures that

A1A2···An

Nsc(cid:16)|ψhiA1|A2|···|An(cid:17) = 0,

and this implies

phrNsc(cid:16)|ψhiA1|A2|···|An(cid:17) = 0

Xh

(71)

(72)

for any pure-state decomposition of ρ(p, λ)
in
Eq. (70). Now Eqs. (65) and (72) lead us to Eq. (64),
which completes the proof.

A1A2···An

The following corollary generalizes Proposition 2 for
arbitrary PCS states, that is, the SCREN SM inequality
in (18) is saturated by PCS states in Eq. (20).

Corollary 3. For the PCS states in Eq. (20), we have

Nsc(cid:16)ρ(p, λ)

For each index vector ~jm = (jm

Theorem 3 complete the proof.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have considered a large class of multi-qudit mixed
state that are in a partially coherent superposition of
a generalized W-class state and the vacuum, and have
provided various useful properties about the structure of
partially coherently superposed states. We have shown
that CKW-type monogamy inequality of multi-qudit en-
tanglement holds for this class of PCS states in terms
of SCREN. We have further shown that SCREN SM in-
equality of multi-qudit entanglement is saturated for PCS
states.

Our result proposes the use of SCREN over tan-
gle in characterizing strongly monogamous property of
multi-party quantum entanglement by providing analytic
proofs of the SCREN monogamy inequalities for some
class of multi-party PCS states. However, it is also inter-
esting and important to investigate how the class of PCS
states behaves with respect to the corresponding tangle
based monogamy inequalities. We believe this investiga-
tion will provide a better clariﬁcation of the usefulness of
PCS states in understanding the constraints on descrip-
tion of entanglement distribution using diﬀerent kinds of
entanglement measures.

Our result presented here is the ﬁrst case where strong
monogamy inequality of multi-qudit mixed states is stud-
ied. Noting the importance of the study on multi-party
quantum entanglement, our result can provide a rich ref-
erence for future work on the study of multi-party quan-
tum entanglement.

[19] The deﬁnition of negativity for a quantum state ρ was
ﬁrst proposed by Vidal and Werner [18] as kρTB k1−1
,
and another deﬁnition of the negativity with a normaliz-
ing factor, kρTB k1−1
, was also used for two-qudit states
ρ [21]. To avoid this inconsistency, here we only use
kρTBk1 − 1 for our deﬁnition of the negativity.

N (|φiA|B) = (tr√ρA)2 − 1,

Nsc (cid:16)|ψiA1|A2···An(cid:17) and Nsc (cid:0)ρA1|Aj(cid:1) as one-SCREN

and two-SCREN, respectively.

[24] The lower term in Inequality (16) appears in between the

both sides of the n-qubit CKW inequality in (5) as

thus it is a stronger inequality.

[25] The term “generalized” naturally arises because Eq. (19)
reduces to three-qubit W state for the case when n = 3
and d = 2. Eq. (19) also includes multi-qubit generalized
W-class states when d = 2.

each qudit subsystem Ai as a d-dimensional Hilbert
space, that is, Ai ∼= Cd for i = 1,·· · , n if there is no

confusion.
