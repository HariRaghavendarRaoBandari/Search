Abstract

Let F denote an algebraically closed ﬁeld. Denote the three-element set by X = {A, B, C}, and let
F hX i denote the free unital associative F-algebra on X . Fix a nonzero q ∈ F such that q4 6= 1. The
universal Askey-Wilson algebra ∆ is the quotient space F hX i /I, where I is the two-sided ideal of F hX i
generated by the nine elements U V − V U , where U is one of A, B, C, and V is one of

Turn F hX i into a Lie algebra with Lie bracket [X, Y ] = XY − Y X for all X, Y ∈ F hX i. Let L denote
the Lie subalgebra of F hX i generated by X , which is also the free Lie algebra on X . Let L denote
the Lie subalgebra of ∆ generated by A, B, C. Since the given set of deﬁning relations of ∆ are not
in L, it is natural to conjecture that L is freely generated by A, B, C. We give an answer in the neg-

Denote the span of all Hall basis elements of L of length n by Ln, and denote the image of Pn

Introduction

Let F be an algebraically closed ﬁeld and ﬁx a nonzero q ∈ F such that q4 6= 1. Given a, b, c ∈ F, the
Askey-Wilson algebra with parameters a, b, c is the unital associative F-algebra AW := AWq(a, b, c) deﬁned
as having generators A, B, C and relations

The algebra AW was introduced in [8] in order to desrcibe the Askey-Wilson polynomials [2]. A wide
range of applications of the Askey-Wilson algebra is discussed in [7, Section 1]. These applications include

1

integrable systems, quantum mechanics, the theory of quadratic algebras, Leonard pairs and Leonard triples,
and quantum groups. A central extension of the Askey-Wilson algebra AW is introduced in [7], which is
called the universal Askey-Wilson algebra.

Deﬁnition 1.1 ([7, Deﬁnition 1.2]). The universal Askey-Wilson algebra is the unital associative F-algebra,
which we denote by ∆, deﬁned as having generators A, B, C, and relations which assert that the following

where q is a nonzero scalar that is not a fourth root of unity.

Our main object of study is the Lie subalgebra L of ∆ generated by A, B, C. We show that a set of
deﬁning relations for ∆ cannot be expressed in terms of Lie algebra operations only, and yet this does not
imply that L is freely generated by A, B, C. Denote the free unital associative F-algebra on the three-element
set X = {A, B, C} by F hX i, and the free Lie algebra on X by L. Recall that L is the Lie subalgebra of F hX i
generated by A, B, C. We use the basis of L which was introduced by Hall [5]. Let us call the images of the
Hall basis elements under the canonical map L → L as the standard Lie monomials of L. We show that the
kernel of the canonical map F hX i → ∆ has a nonzero intersection with L. The generators A, B, C are the
standard Lie monomials of length 1. The standard Lie monomials of lengths ≥ 1 are constructed according
to some rules, which we shall discuss in later sections. We show that the simplest Lie algebra relations on L
occur at length 5, and we determine a maximal linearly independent set of standard Lie monomials of length
at most 5.

2 Preliminaries

Let F be an algebraically closed ﬁeld. Throughout, by an F-algebra we mean a unital associative F-algebra.
Let A be an F-algebra. Recall that an anti-automorphism of A is a bijective F-linear map ψ : A → A such
that ψ(f g) = ψ(g)ψ(f ) for all f, g ∈ A. We turn A into a Lie algebra with Lie bracket [f, g] = f g − gf for
f, g ∈ A.

Let N = {0, 1, 2, . . .} denote the set of natural numbers. Given a nonzero n ∈ N, let X denote an n-
element set. We shall refer to any element of X as a letter. For t ∈ N, by a word of length t on X we mean
a sequence of the form

X1X2 · · · Xt,

(4)

where Xi ∈ X for 1 ≤ i ≤ t. Given a word W on X , denote the length of W by |W |. The word of length 0
will be denoted by 1. Let hX i denote the set of all words on X . Given words X1X2 · · · Xs and Y1Y2 · · · Yt
on X , their concatenation product is

X1X2 · · · XsY1Y2 · · · Yt.

We now recall the free F-algebra F hX i. The F-vector space F hX i has basis hX i. Multiplication in the
F-algebra F hX i is the concatenation product. We endow F hX i with a symmetric bilinear form ( , ) with
respect to which hX i is an orthonormal basis. For any f ∈ F hX i and any word W , the coeﬃcient of W in
f is (f, W ).

Given n ∈ N, the subspace of F hX i spanned by all the words of length n is the n-homogenous component
of F hX i. Observe that F hX i is the direct sum of all the n-homogenous components for n ∈ N. If f is an
element of the m-homogenous component and g is an element of the n-homogenous component, then f g is
an element of the (m + n)-homogenous component. It follows that the set of all n-homogenous components
of F hX i for all n ∈ N is a grading of F hX i.

2

The following notation will be useful. Let W = X1X2 · · · Xt denote a word on X . We deﬁne W ∗ to be

the word XtXt−1 · · · X1 on X . Let θ denote the F-linear map

θ : F hX i → F hX i ,

W 7→ (−1)|W |W ∗,

(5)

for any word W . By [6, p. 19], the map θ is the unique anti-automorphism of the F-algebra F hX i that sends
X to −X for any letter X.

Let L denote the Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra F hX i generated by X . Following [6, Theorem 0.5],

we call L the free Lie algebra on X .

Proposition 2.1 ([6, Lemma 1.7]). For f ∈ L, we have θ(f ) = −f .

We now recall the notion of a Lie monomial on X . The set of all Lie monomials on X is the minimal
subset of F hX i that contains X and is closed under the Lie bracket. Observe that 0 is a Lie monomial.
Let U be a Lie monomial. Then U is an element of some n-homogenous component of F hX i. We deﬁne
the length of the Lie monomial U to be n. Observe that 0 has length n for any n ∈ N. Any nonzero Lie
monomial has a unique length. Observe that the set of all Lie monomials of length 1 is X . We now consider
an ordering of Lie monomials.

Deﬁnition 2.2 ([4, p. 581]). Fix an ordering < on X . Suppose that the set of all Lie monomials of lengths
1, 2, . . . , t − 1 have been ordered such that U < V if the length of U is strictly less than that of V . If U, V both
have length t, and can be written as U = [X1, Y1] , V = [X2, Y2], then we compare U, V using the following
rules:

(i) If Y1 6= Y2, then U < V iﬀ Y1 < Y2.

(ii) If Y1 = Y2, then U < V iﬀ X1 < X2.

We now introduce a basis for L consisting of Lie monomials.

Proposition 2.3 ([5, Theorem 3.1]). Let H be the set of Lie monomials such that X ⊂ H, and that for any
U, V ∈ H, the Lie monomial [U, V ] is also in H whenever the following conditions hold.

(i) U > V .

(ii) If U = [X, Y ] for some Lie monomials X, Y , then Y ≤ V .

Then H is a basis for L, often referred to as the Hall basis of L.

Example 2.4. Suppose X = {A, B, C} and A < B < C. Then the elements of H of length at most 4 are:

A, B, C, [B, A] , [C, A] , [C, B] , [[B, A] , A] , [[C, A] , A] , [[B, A] , B] ,

[[C, A] , B] , [[C, B] , B] , [[B, A] , C] , [[C, A] , C] , [[C, B] , C] ,
[[[B, A] , A] , A] , [[[C, A] , A] , A] , [[[B, A] , A] , B] , [[[C, A] , A] , B] ,

[[[B, A] , B] , B] , [[[C, A] , B] , B] , [[[C, B] , B] , B] , [[[B, A] , A] , C] ,
[[[C, A] , A] , C] , [[[B, A] , B] , C] , [[[C, A] , B] , C] , [[[C, B] , B] , C] ,

[[[B, A] , C] , C] , [[[C, A] , C] , C] , [[[C, B] , C] , C] ,
[[C, A] , [B, A]] , [[C, B] , [B, A]] , [[C, B] , [C, A]] .

(6)

Observe that the above Lie monomials are listed according to the ordering in Deﬁnition 2.2.

Given a Lie algebra L and x, y ∈ L, recall the adjoint linear map

ad x : L → L

that sends y 7→ [x, y]. Denote an arbitrary word on X by W = X1X2 · · · Xt. The Lie bracketing from left to
right is the linear map F hX i → L that sends 1 7→ 0 and sends the word W into a Lie monomial according
to the following rules:

3

(i) If |W | = 1, then W 7→ W .

(ii) Suppose that the images of all words of length < |W | have been deﬁned. Denote the image of

X1X2 · · · Xt−1 by V . Then

W 7→ (−ad Xt) (V ) = [V, Xt] .

That is, X1X2 · · · Xt 7→ [[[X1, X2] , · · · ] , Xt] for t ≥ 2. A Lie monomial that is an image of some word under
Lie bracketing from left to right is said to be left-normed.

Notation 2.5. Given a word W , we denote the image of W under Lie bracketing from left to right by [W ].

Example 2.6. With reference to Example 2.4, we rewrite (6) using Notation 2.5.

Throughout, by an ideal of an F-algebra A we mean a two-sided ideal of A. By a Lie ideal of a Lie
algebra L we mean an ideal of L under the Lie algebra structure. We now recall the notion of algebras
having generators and relations (i.e., having a presentation). Denote the elements of X by G1, G2, . . . , Gn.
Let f1, f2, . . . , fm ∈ F hX i and let I be the ideal of F hX i generated by f1, f2, . . . , fm. We deﬁne F hX i /I
as the F-algebra with generators G1, G2, . . . , Gn and relations f1 = 0, f2 = 0, . . . , fm = 0. The Lie subalgebra
of F hX i /I generated by X is L/ (I ∩ L).

Let g1, g2, . . . , gm ∈ L and let J be the Lie ideal of L generated by g1, g2, . . . , gm. We deﬁne L/J as the

Lie algebra with generators G1, G2, . . . , Gn and relations g1 = 0, g2 = 0, . . . , gm = 0.

Suppose L is a Lie algebra (over F) generated by X . Then there exists an ideal K of L such that L = L/K.

Let φ : L → L/K be the canonical Lie algebra homomorphism. Then the following span L:

φ(U ),

for U ∈ H.

(8)

We call (8) the standard Lie monomials of the Lie algebra L. Observe that the list of the standard Lie
monomials of L is identical to the list of elements of H. This is because the Lie algebra homomorphism φ
ﬁxes generators. We order the list of standard Lie monomials of L in a manner analogous to that given in
Deﬁnition 2.2.

3 The universal Askey-Wilson algebra

Hereon, let F be an algebraically closed ﬁeld, and ﬁx a nonzero q ∈ F such that q4 6= 1. We ﬁx X = {A, B, C}.
Let F hX i be the free associative algebra on X . We use the ordering A < B < C to construct the Hall basis
H of the free Lie algebra L on X . Deﬁne the following elements of the free algebra F hX i.

α := (q + q−1)A +

β := (q + q−1)B +

We also deﬁne the following Lie products in F hX i.

r0 := [A, α] ,
r1 := [B, β] ,
r2 := [C, γ] ,

r3 := [B, α] ,
r4 := [C, β] ,
r5 := [A, γ] ,

r6 := [C, α] ,
r7 := [A, β] ,
r8 := [B, γ] .

Deﬁne I as the ideal of F hX i generated by r0, r1, . . . , r8.

With reference to Deﬁnition 1.1, we express ∆ as a quotient space of F hX i, and as a consequence make

explicit the deﬁning relations of ∆.

Proposition 3.1. ∆ = F hX i /I.

Proof. Recall ∆ has relations which assert that each of (1),(2),(3) commutes with every element of ∆.
Equivalently, each of (1),(2),(3) commutes with every generator A, B, C. Observe that each of α, β, γ is a
scalar multiple of (1),(2),(3), respectively. Then it suﬃces to deﬁne ∆ as having nine deﬁning relations of
the form [X, δ], where X ∈ {A, B, C} and δ ∈ {α, β, γ}. By the deﬁnition of I, we get the desired result. (cid:4)

We denote the images of α, β, γ under the canonical map F hX i → ∆ by the same symbols.

Proposition 3.2. r0, r1, . . . , r8 /∈ L.

Proof. Let θ denote the F-linear map in (5). It is routine to show that in the free algebra F hX i, we have
θ(ri) + ri 6= 0 for 0 ≤ i ≤ 8. Use Proposition 2.1.
(cid:4)
By a a word in ∆ we mean the image of an element of hX i under the canonical map F hX i → ∆. Observe
that the list of all words in ∆ is identical to the list of all the words on X in the free algebra F hX i since
the canonical map F hX i → ∆ is an F-algebra homomorphism that ﬁxes generators. We also preserve the
ordering of generators A < B < C in ∆. By a ∆-word, we mean all elements of ∆ of the form

W αrβsγt

(12)

where W is a word in ∆, and r, s, t ∈ N.

We now recall some properties of ∆ as studied in [7]. Let U = X1X2 · · · Xt be a ∆-word, where Xi is
either a generator of ∆ or one of α, β, γ for 1 ≤ i ≤ t. Without loss of generality, we assume U is of the
form (12) since α, β, γ are central in ∆. By an inversion for W we mean an ordered pair (j, k) ∈ N2 such
that 1 ≤ j < k ≤ t and Xj, Xk ∈ {A, B, C} such that Xj > Xk. Any ∆-word with no inversions is said
to be irreducible. For instance, CABA has 4 inversions and CB2A has 5, while the ∆-words A2BC, AB2C
are irreducible. The shortest words for which inversions exist are BA, CA, CB and using (9) to (11), the
following hold in both F hX i and ∆.

BA = q2AB + q(q + q−1)(q − q−1)C − q(q − q−1)γ,
CA = q−2AC − q−1(q + q−1)(q − q−1)B + q−1(q − q−1)β,
CB = q2BC + q(q + q−1)(q − q−1)A − q(q − q−1)α.

(13)

(14)
(15)

Consider the word CABA, one of the 4 inversions in which is caused by the ﬁrst two letters C, A. Substituting
for CA using (14), the result is a linear combination of ACBA, B2A, BAβ, each having fewer inversions than
CABA.

Remark 3.3. Following [7, p. 7] and [3, Theorem 1.2], for any ∆-word W , there exists a ﬁnite number of
steps of substituting for inversions using (13) to (15) such that the ﬁnal result is a unique linear combination
of irreducible ∆-words. It follows that a basis for ∆ consists of the vectors

AiBjC kαrβsγt,

i, j, k, r, s, t, ∈ N.

(16)

Given subspaces H, K of ∆, deﬁne HK := Span {hk | h ∈ H, k ∈ K}. If K is a subspace of H, we say

that a subspace K ′ of H is a complement of K in H whenever

H = K + K ′.

We now recall a ﬁltration for ∆ as given in [7, Section 5]. This ﬁltration is a sequence {∆n}n∈N of subspaces
of ∆ deﬁned by

∆0
∆1
∆n

:= F1,
:= ∆0 + Span {A, B, C, α, β, γ},

and has the following properties for all i, j ∈ N.

∆i ⊆ ∆i+1,

∆ = [n∈N

∆n,

∆i∆j = ∆i+j .

Given n ∈ N, a basis for ∆n consists of the vectors

AiBjC kαrβsγt,

i, j, k, r, s, t, ∈ N,

i + j + k + r + s + t ≤ n,

while the following vectors form a basis for a complement of ∆n in ∆n+1

AiBjC kαrβsγt,

i, j, k, r, s, t, ∈ N,

i + j + k + r + s + t = n + 1.

We denote the span of the vectors (20) by ∆c
n.

By [7, Lemma 6.1], the following elements of ∆ coincide and are central.

qABC + q2A2 + q−2B2 + q2C2 − qAα − q−1Bβ − qCγ,
qBCA + q2A2 + q2B2 + q−2C2 − qAα − qBβ − q−1Cγ,
qCAB + q−2A2 + q2B2 + q2C2 − q−1Aα − qBβ − qCγ,
q−1CBA + q−2A2 + q2B2 + q−2C2 − q−1Aα − qBβ − q−1Cγ,

Denote this element by Ω, which is called in [7] as the Casimir element of ∆. As shown in [7, Section 7], we
have other bases for ∆, ∆n (for n ∈ N) that involve Ω. First, the following vectors form a basis for ∆.

AiBjC kΩlαrβsγt,

i, j, k, l, r, s, t ∈ N,

ijk = 0.

(27)

Given n ∈ N, a basis for ∆n consists of the vectors

AiBjC kΩlαrβsγt,

i, j, k, l, r, s, t ∈ N, ijk = 0, i + j + k + 3l + r + s + t ≤ n,

(28)

while the following vectors form a basis for a complement of ∆n in ∆n+1.

AiBjC kΩlαrβsγt,

i, j, k, l, r, s, t ∈ N, ijk = 0, i + j + k + 3l + r + s + t = n + 1.

Recall that ∆ is a Lie algebra with Lie bracket [X, Y ] := XY − Y X for X, Y ∈ ∆. Denote the derived
algebra of ∆ by [∆, ∆], and the ideal of ∆ generated by [∆, ∆] by ∆ [∆, ∆] ∆.
It follows that the Lie
subalgebra of ∆ generated by A, B, C is L := L/(I ∩ L). Given nonzero n ∈ N, denote the span of all Hall
i=1 Li under the canonical map L → L by Ln.

basis elements of L of length n by Ln. Denote the image of Pn

It follows that all standard Lie monomials of L of length at most n span Ln.

Proposition 3.4. L ⊆ FA + FB + FC + ∆ [∆, ∆] ∆.

Proof. By the deﬁnition of L, we have L ⊆ FA + FB + FC + [∆, ∆]. Since ∆ has a multiplicative identity,
we have [∆, ∆] ⊆ ∆ [∆, ∆] ∆. From these we get the desired set inclusion.
(cid:4)

Proposition 3.5. If q is not a root of unity, then L has zero center.

6

Proof. Let q be not a root of unity. Suppose that Z(L) has a nonzero element f . Since the generators
A, B, C of ∆ are also in L, we have Z(L) ⊆ Z(∆). By [7, Corollary 8.3], Z(∆) is generated by α, β, γ, Ω.
Observe that there exists a ﬁltration subspace ∆n such that f ∈ ∆n, and that ∆n ∩ Z(∆) has a basis
consisting of the vectors

Since f is nonzero, there exists a nonzero c ∈ F and a vector Ωwαxβyγz in (29) such that

Ωlαrβsγt,

l, r, s, t ∈ N, 3l + r + s + t ≤ n.

shown in [7, p. 17], there exists a unique surjective F-algebra homomorphism Ψ : ∆ → F(cid:2) ¯A, ¯B, ¯C(cid:3) with

kernel ∆ [∆, ∆] ∆ that sends

(31)
Under this homomorphism, denote the images of α, β, γ, Ω by ¯α, ¯β, ¯γ, ¯Ω, respectively. As shown in [7,
Lemma 11.3], we have

A 7→ ¯A, B 7→ ¯B, C 7→ ¯C.

¯α = (q + q−1) ¯A + ¯B ¯C,
¯β = (q + q−1) ¯B + ¯A ¯C,
¯γ = (q + q−1) ¯C + ¯A ¯B,
¯Ω = (q + q−1) ¯A ¯B ¯C − ¯A2 − ¯B2 − ¯C2.

It is routine to show that the vectors

¯A, ¯B, ¯C, ¯Ωl ¯αr ¯βs¯γt,

l, r, s, t ∈ N, 3l + r + s + t ≤ n,

are linearly independent in F(cid:2) ¯A, ¯B, ¯C(cid:3). Observe also that by Proposition 3.4,

f ∈ FA + FB + FC + ker Ψ.

Applying Ψ to both sides of (30), we have

c1 ¯A + c2 ¯B + c3 ¯C − c ¯Ωw ¯αx ¯βy ¯γz = ¯g,

(36)

(37)

where ¯g is a linear combination of the vectors in (36) except ¯Ωw ¯αx ¯βy ¯γz. We get a contradiction from (37).
Therefore, Z(L) = 0.
(cid:4)
We end this section by discussing some properties of ∆ related to the group P SL2(Z). We denote by
P SL2(Z) the free product of the cyclic group of order two and the cyclic group of order three [1]. Let ρ, σ
denote the generators of P SL2(Z) such that ρ3 = 1 and σ2 = 1. By [7, Theorem 3.1], the group P SL2(Z)
acts faithfully on ∆ as a group of automorphisms in the following way:

By [7, Theorem 6.4], Ω is ﬁxed by ρ, σ. It is routine to show that given n ∈ N, the ﬁltration subspace ∆n is
invariant under ρ.

Proposition 3.6. The Lie algebra L is P SL2(Z)-invariant.

Proof. Let τ ∈ {ρ, σ}. It suﬃces to argue in the following way. Show that the images of the generators
A, B, C under τ are in L, and show that if the images of f, g ∈ L under τ are in L, then so is the image of
[f, g] under τ . By the above table, we are done with the ﬁrst step. For the second step, assume that the
images of f, g ∈ L under τ are in L. Since τ is an F-algebra automorphism, we have τ ([f, g]) = τ (f g − gf ) =
[τ (f ), τ (g)] ∈ L.
(cid:4)

4 L is not free

In this section, all computations are done in the free algebra F hX i. Our goal is to show that I ∩ L contains
a nonzero element.

−ad C to both sides of (38). The result involves ACB in the right side, which can be further simpliﬁed
using (15). From this, we get (41).

Proof. Apply −ad B to both sides of (41). The left side involves BA2 which can be written uniquely as a
linear combination of A2B, AC, Aγ, B, β by repeated use of the relations (13),(14). We get

[BACB]

q2(q + q−1)2(q − q−1)3 = A2B + q−3(q4 + 1)AC − Aγ

all Lie monomials in terms of Hall basis elements. From this, we get (44).

[BA]

[r0, B] − [r3, A]

using r0 = [A, α] , r3 = [B, α]. The result is (46).

(cid:4)

Theorem 4.6. The Lie algebra L = L/(I ∩ L) is not freely generated by A, B, C.

Proof. Observe that if we write I0 in terms of Hall basis elements, we have

I0 =

[[[CB] , [BA]] , [BA]] − [[BABC] , [BA]]

(q + q−1)2(q − q−1)2

+ (cid:2)(cid:2)BA2(cid:3) , [BA](cid:3)

q − q−1

− 2 [[CA] , [BA]] ,

which, by the linear independence of the Hall basis elements, implies that I0 6= 0. But by (46), we have
I0 ∈ I ∩ L. Therefore, L/(I ∩ L) 6= L.
(cid:4)

5 Properties of some standard Lie monomials of L

We discuss properties of some standard Lie monomials of L in relation to the ﬁltration {∆n}n∈N of ∆.

Proposition 5.1. For any i, j ∈ N, the following hold in ∆.

(cid:2)BAi(cid:3) − qi(q − q−1)iAiB ∈ ∆i,
(cid:2)CAi(cid:3) − (−1)iq−i(q − q−1)iAiC ∈ ∆i,
(cid:2)CBj(cid:3) − qj(q − q−1)jBjC ∈ ∆j.

(cid:2)BAi−1(cid:3) − qi−1(q − q−1)i−1Ai−1B ∈ ∆i−1.

Proof. We show (48) holds by induction on i. The case i = 0 is trivial. Suppose that for some i ∈ N, we
have

Denote the element in (51) by X. By the properties of the ﬁltration {∆n}n∈N, we have [X, A] ∈ ∆i. Using
(48), we further obtain

(49)

(50)

(51)

(cid:4)

(52)

(53)

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

[X, A] + qi(q − q−1)iAi−1(cid:0)(q + q−1)C − γ(cid:1) = (cid:2)BAi(cid:3) − qi(q − q−1)iAiB,

which proves (48). The relations (49) and (50) are proven similarly.

Proposition 5.2 ([7, Lemma 8.1]). Let i, j, k ∈ N. Then the following hold in ∆.

(cid:2)A, AiBjC k(cid:3) − (cid:0)1 − q2(j−k)(cid:1) Ai+1BjC k ∈ ∆i+j+k,
(cid:2)B, AiBjC k(cid:3) − (cid:0)q2i − q2k(cid:1) AiBj+1C k
(cid:2)C, AiBjC k(cid:3) − (cid:0)q2(j−i) − 1(cid:1) AiBj C k+1 ∈ ∆i+j+k.

∈ ∆i+j+k,

Proposition 5.3. For nonzero i, j, k ∈ N, the following hold in ∆.

(cid:2)BAiBj(cid:3) − (−1)jqi(q2i − 1)j(q − q−1)iAiBj+1 ∈ ∆i+j,
(cid:2)CAiC k(cid:3) − (−1)iq−i(2k+1)(q2i − 1)k(q − q−1)iAiC k+1 ∈ ∆i+k,
(cid:2)CBj C k(cid:3) − (−1)kqj(q2j − 1)k(q − q−1)jBjC k+1 ∈ ∆j+k.

Proof. To show (55), use the relation (48), the relation (53) with k set to zero, and induction on j. The
relations (56) and (57) are proven similarly.
(cid:4)

Proposition 5.4. The complement ∆c

1 of ∆1 in ∆2 contains [CAB] and [BAC].

Proof. Use the canonical map F hX i → ∆ on (41) in order to obtain

[BAC]

(q + q−1)(q − q−1)2 = B2 − A2 +

Aα − Bβ
q + q−1 ∈ ∆c
1.

Apply −ρ2 to both sides of (58). We get

[CAB]

(q + q−1)(q − q−1)2 = C2 − A2 +

Aα − Cγ
q + q−1 ∈ ∆c

1. (cid:4)

Proposition 5.5. For nonzero i, j, k ∈ N with i ≥ 2, the following hold in ∆.

(cid:2)BABjC k(cid:3) − (−1)j+kq−j(q2j − 1)k(q − q−1)j+1Bj C k−1Ω ∈ ∆j+k+1,
(cid:2)CAiBj(cid:3) − (−1)i+jq1−i(q2(i−1) − 1)j(q − q−1)iAi−1Bj−1Ω ∈ ∆i+j ,
(cid:2)CAiBC k(cid:3) − (−1)i+1q(1−i)(1+2k)(q2(i−1) − 1)k+1(q − q−1)iAi−1C kΩ ∈ ∆i+k+1.

Proof. We show (59) holds. We ﬁrst consider the case k = 1. By setting i = 1 in (55), we get

Apply −ad C to the element in (62). We get

(cid:2)BABj(cid:3) − (−1)jqj+1(q − q−1)j+1ABj+1 ∈ ∆j+1.

In (54) set i, j, k to 1, j + 1, 0, respectively, and combine with (63). We have

(cid:2)BABj C(cid:3) − (−1)jqj+1(q − q−1)j+1(cid:2)ABj+1, C(cid:3) ∈ ∆j+2.

(cid:2)BABj C(cid:3) − (−1)j+1qj+1(q2j − 1)(q − q−1)j+1ABj+1C ∈ ∆j+2.

Using (13), it is routine to show that

ABn − q−2nBnA ∈ ∆n,

for n ∈ N. Set n = j + 1 in (65) and multiply the element by C from the right. We get

ABj+1C − q−2(j+1)Bj+1AC ∈ ∆j+2.

From (64) and (66), we get

(cid:2)BABj C(cid:3) − (−1)j+1q−(j+1)(q2j − 1)(q − q−1)j+1Bj+1AC ∈ ∆j+2.

Using the fact that Ω is equal to (26), we have

Bj+1AC − qBjΩ ∈ ∆j+2.

From (67) and (68), we get

(cid:2)BABj C(cid:3) − (−1)j+1q−j(q2j − 1)(q − q−1)j+1BjΩ ∈ ∆j+2,

from which we see that (59) holds for k = 1 and for nonzero j ∈ N. Using (54),(69) and induction on k, we
ﬁnd that (59) holds for nonzero j, k ∈ N. We now show (60) holds. Since i ≥ 2, we can rewrite (59) changing
the exponents j, k to i − 1, j, respectively.

(cid:2)BABi−1C j(cid:3) − (−1)i+j−1q1−i(q2(i−1) − 1)j(q − q−1)iBi−1C j−1Ω ∈ ∆i+j

Denote the element in (70) by X. Since ∆i+j is invariant under ρ, we have −ρ2(X) ∈ ∆i+j , where −ρ2(X)
is the element in (60). Thus, (60) holds for nonzero i, j ∈ N. Finally, we show (61) holds. Set j = 1 in (60).

(cid:2)CAiB(cid:3) − (−1)i+1q1−i(q2(i−1) − 1)(q − q−1)iAi−1Ω ∈ ∆i+1

(71)

10

Since Ω is central, if we apply −ad C to the element in (71), we get

From (54) we obtain

(cid:2)CAiBC(cid:3) − (−1)i+1q1−i(q2(i−1) − 1)(q − q−1)i(cid:2)Ai−1, C(cid:3) Ω ∈ ∆i+2.

From (71) and (73),

(cid:2)Ai−1, C(cid:3) Ω − q−2(i−1)(q2(i−1) − 1)Ai−1CΩ ∈ ∆i+2.

(cid:2)CAiBC(cid:3) − (−1)i+1q(1−i)·3(q2(i−1) − 1)2(q − q−1)iAi−1CΩ ∈ ∆i+2,

from which we see that (61) holds for k = 1. Using (54),(74) and induction on k, we ﬁnd that (61) holds for
nonzero i, k ∈ N with i ≥ 2.
(cid:4)

Proposition 5.6. The following hold in ∆.

(cid:2)CA2B(cid:3) + (q − q−1)3AΩ ∈ ∆3,

[BABC] − (q − q−1)3BΩ ∈ ∆3,
[[CB] , [CA]] − (q − q−1)3CΩ ∈ ∆3.

(75)
(76)

(77)

Proof. The relations (75),(76) follow from (60),(59), respectively. We show (77) holds. Let V := −(cid:2)BAC2(cid:3)+

[CABC]. By Proposition 5.4, we have V ∈ ∆3. Denote the element in (76) by X. Using the fact that ∆3 is
invariant under ρ, we have

ρ(X) = [CBCA] − (q − q−1)3CΩ ∈ ∆3.

Using the Jacobi identity to express [CBCA] in terms of standard Lie monomials, we further have

and it follows that

ρ(X) = [[CB] , [CA]] − V − (q − q−1)3CΩ ∈ ∆3,

[[CB] , [CA]] − (q − q−1)3CΩ = V + ρ(X) ∈ ∆3. (cid:4)

6 The standard Lie monomials of L of length at most 4

Recall that the span of the standard Lie monomials of L of length at most n is Ln. Our goal in this section
is to show that the standard Lie monomials of L of length at most 4 are linearly independent, and hence
form a basis for L4.

(cid:2)CBC k(cid:3) − (−1)kq(k+1)(q − q−1)k+1BC k+1 ∈ ∆k+1,

(cid:2)CB2C k(cid:3) − (−1)kq2(k+1)(q + q−1)k(q − q−1)k+2B2C k+1 ∈ ∆k+2.

Proof. Set i = 1, 2 in (55) to get (78),(81). Do similarly to (56) and (57) in order to show the other
relations.

Proof. Fix n ∈ N. It suﬃces to show that there exists an upper triangular transition matrix from the above
vectors to a subset of the basis of ∆ consisting of the vectors in (27):

AiBjC kΩlαrβsγt,

i, j, k, l, r, s, t ∈ N,

ijk = 0.

Let i, j, k ∈ N such that 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ n. From Propositions 5.1, 5.4, 5.6, 6.1 we have the following data:

[CAB] − c1C2 − d1A2 − d2Cγ − d3Aα ∈ ∆0,
[BAC] − c2B2 − d4A2 − d5Bβ − d6Aα ∈ ∆0,
(cid:2)CA2B(cid:3) − c3AΩ ∈ ∆3,

[BABC] − c4BΩ ∈ ∆3,
[[CB] , [CA]] − c5CΩ ∈ ∆3,

(cid:2)BAi(cid:3) − eiAiB ∈ ∆i,

where the small letters (other than i, j, k) denote scalars. Each of (92) to (103) is of the form M − aV ∈ ∆m,
where M is a Lie monomial, a ∈ F, and V is an element of the basis of ∆ consisting of the vectors in (27),
and V /∈ ∆m. Call V the leading term of M . For (90),(91), deﬁne the leading terms of [CAB], [BAC]
by C2, B2, respectively. Observe that no two distinct Lie monomials found in (90) to (103) have the same
leading terms. This yields a transition matrix from the vectors (84) to (89) to some of the vectors in (27)
such that all entries below the main diagonal are zero, and that the diagonal entries are

c1, . . . , c5, ei, fi, gj, e′

By Propositions 5.1, 5.4, 5.6 and 6.1, all such scalars are nonzero. Hence, the transition matrix is upper
triangular.

Notation 6.3. Let In denote the set consisting of all the linearly independent vectors in Lemma 6.2.

Lemma 6.4. Fix nonzero m, n ∈ N. The vectors Xαrβsγt are linearly independent in ∆ for any X ∈ In
and any r, s, t ∈ N such that r + s + t ≤ m.

Proof. The proof is similar to that of Lemma 6.2, but with (90) to (103) modiﬁed as follows. For each of
(90) to (103), multiply the element by αrβsγt and add r + s + t to the index of the ﬁltration subspace. Based
on these new data, an upper triangular transition matrix can be constructed.

of (106) to get (107),(108), respectively. To get (109), apply σ to both sides of (106). Apply ρ, ρ2 to both

(cid:4)

Lemma 6.7. The vectors in I ∗ are linearly independent in ∆.

Proof. We use (106) to (111) to construct a transition matrix from the elements of I 1
I ∗. Denote such transition matrix by T . Order the rows of T such that the last 17 correspond to

in that order, while order the columns of T such that the last 17 correspond to the vectors in (112),(113)
together with

[CB] γ, [BA] β, [CA] α, [CB] β, [CA] γ, [BA] α.

(115)

Observe that all the vectors in I 1
3 to be replaced to form I ∗ are in (115), all the replacements are in (114),
and all the other vectors that appear in (106) to (111) (which we use to construct the transition matrix)
appear in (112),(113). Then T is of the form

0 T ′ (cid:21)
T = (cid:20) I M

where I is an identity matrix, M is some matrix with 7 columns, and T ′ is a 7 × 7 matrix which has the
following properties. All diagonal entries of T ′ are nonzero. Denote the ij-entry of T ′ by T ′
ij. All entries of
T ′ below the main diagonal and all entries in the ﬁrst two rows are zero except the ones that appear below:

(q − q−1)2 = −T ′

11 = T ′

31 = −T ′

71 = −T ′

22 = T ′

62 6= 0.

By these observations about T ′, we ﬁnd that T is invertible. This implies that the vectors in I ∗ are linearly
independent.

Theorem 6.8. The standard Lie monomials of L of length at most 4 form a basis for L4.

holds in ∆. In view of Remark 3.3, write each of the left and right sides of (122) as a linear combination
of irreducible ∆-words. This yields the same linear combination of the basis vectors (16) of ∆. Apply
−ad A, −ad B, −ad B, −ad C to both sides of (106),(108),(109),(110), respectively. Write all Lie monomials
in standard form. We get

(cid:2)BA2(cid:3) α = f1,
(cid:2)CA2(cid:3) β = f2,

[CAB] γ = f3,
[BAC] γ + k [CAB] γ = f4,

(123)

(124)

(125)
(126)

for some k ∈ F and some f1, f2, f3, f4 ∈ L. Eliminate (cid:2)BA2(cid:3) α,(cid:2)CA2(cid:3) β, [BAC] γ in (122) using (123) to

(126). The result is (118). Apply ρ, ρ2 to both sides of (118) in order to obtain (119),(120), respectively.
We now show (121) holds. Add (116) and (117). We get

where g1, g2 are the right sides of (116),(117), respectively. Apply −ρ to both sides of (117). We get

[CB] α + [CA] β = g1 + g2,

[CB] α + [CA] β = g3,

(127)

(128)

for some g3 ∈ L such that [[CAC] , [CB]] appears with nonzero coeﬃcient in g3. Eliminate [CB] α + [CA] β
in (127),(128). We get (121) as desired.
(cid:4)

At this point we have shown that each of

(129)

is linearly dependent on standard Lie monomials of length at most 5 that are not in (129). In what follows,
we shall show that the standard Lie monomials of length at most 5 except (129) are linearly independent in
∆.

Proposition 7.3. The following hold in ∆.

(cid:2)CA3B(cid:3) − (q + q−1)(q − q−1)4A2Ω ∈ ∆4,
(cid:2)CA2B2(cid:3) − q(q − q−1)4ABΩ ∈ ∆4,
(cid:2)CA2BC(cid:3) + q−1(q − q−1)4ACΩ ∈ ∆4,
(cid:2)BAB2C(cid:3) + (q + q−1)(q − q−1)4B2Ω ∈ ∆4,
(cid:2)BABC2(cid:3) + q(q − q−1)4BCΩ ∈ ∆4,
[[CBC] , [CA]] + (q + q−1)(q − q−1)4C2Ω ∈ ∆4.

Proof. Use Proposition 5.5 to show (130) to (134) hold. To show (135), set i = 2 in (49). We get

(cid:2)CA2(cid:3) − q−2(q − q−1)2A2C ∈ ∆2.

Applying −ρ2 to the element in (136) and using the fact that ∆2 is invariant under ρ, we have

Set i = 1 in (49). We get

[CBC] + q−2(q − q−1)2C2B ∈ ∆2.

[CA] + q−1(q − q−1)AC ∈ ∆1.

By taking the Lie bracket of the elements in (137) and (138), we have

[[CBC] , [CA]] − q−3(q − q−1)3(cid:0)C2BAC − AC3B(cid:1) ∈ ∆3 ⊂ ∆4.

Using (14), it is routine to show that

C2A − q−4AC2 ∈ ∆2,

from which we obtain

Combining (139) and (140), we obtain

(q − q−1)3(cid:0)qC2ACB − q−3AC3B(cid:1) ∈ ∆4.

Using the fact that (25) and (26) are both equal to Ω, we have

[[CBC] , [CA]] − (q − q−1)3C2(cid:0)q−3BAC − qACB(cid:1) ∈ ∆4.

(q + q−1)(q − q−1)Ω + q−3BAC − qACB ∈ ∆2.

Finally, we get (135) from (141) and (142).

Proposition 7.4. For nonzero j, k ∈ N, the following hold in ∆.

(cid:2)BA3Bj(cid:3) − (−1)jq3(q6 − 1)j(q − q−1)3A3Bj+1 ∈ ∆j+3,
(cid:2)CA3C k(cid:3) + q−3(2k+1)(q6 − 1)k(q − q−1)3A3C k+1 ∈ ∆k+3,
(cid:2)CB3C k(cid:3) − (−1)kq3(q6 − 1)k(q − q−1)3B3C k+1 ∈ ∆k+3.

Proof. The proof is similar to that of Lemma 6.2.
In order to construct the desired upper triangular
transition matrix, we combine the data from (90) to (103) to that in (130) to (135), and (143) to (145).
Recall that the transition matrix that can be constructed from the data is upper triangular if the scalar
coeﬃcients of the leading terms are nonzero. Those in (90) to (103) are nonzero as shown in the proof of
Lemma 6.2. The scalar coeﬃcients in (130) to (135) are nonzero by the manner q is deﬁned. Finally, the
scalar coeﬃcients in (143) to (145) are nonzero since q is further assumed to be not a sixth root of unity. (cid:4)

Notation 7.6. Let Jn denote the set consisting of all the linearly independent vectors in Lemma 7.5.

Lemma 7.7. Assume q is not a sixth root of unity. Fix nonzero m, n ∈ N. The vectors Y αrβsγt are linearly
independent in ∆ for any Y ∈ Jn and any r, s, t ∈ N such that r + s + t ≤ m.

Proof. The proof is similar to that of Lemma 6.2. For each of the data used in the proof of Lemma 7.5,
which are (90) to (103), (130) to (135), and (143) to (145), multiply the element by αrβsγt and add r + s + t
to the index of the ﬁltration subspace. Use these new data to construct a similar upper triangular transition
matrix.

Lemma 7.9. Assume q is not a sixth root of unity. The vectors in J ∗ are linearly independent in ∆.

Proposition 7.10. Assume q is not a sixth root of unity. If V is a subspace of Span J ∗ such that

Span J ∗ = V + Span J 0

(direct sum)

then a basis for V is J ∗\J 0

Notation 7.12. Observe that the vectors

are in J ∗. Let K0 denote the set obtained from J ∗ by replacing the vectors in (166),(167) by the vectors

[CAC] α, [CBC] β, (cid:2)BA2(cid:3) γ, [BAB] γ,
(cid:2)CA2(cid:3) β, [CAC] β, (cid:2)CB2(cid:3) α, [CBC] α,

Lemma 7.13. Assume q is not a sixth root of unity. The vectors in K0 are linearly independent in ∆.

Proof. We use Lemma 7.11 in order to obtain a transition matrix from the vectors in J ∗ into the vectors
in K0. Denote each of (156) to (163) by

Mi + fi ∈ Span J 0
4 ,

where 1 ≤ i ≤ 8, the vector Mi is an element of J ∗ that is to be replaced in order to form K0, while the
standard Lie monomials that appear in fi are the replacements. Using the usual ordering of standard Lie
monomials, deﬁne M i as the largest standard Lie monomial in fi. Let j, k ∈ N, with 1 ≤ j, k ≤ 8. Observe
that if Mj 6= Mk then M j 6= M k. Observe also that Mi ∈ J ∗\J 0
4 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 8. By Proposition 7.10, the
coeﬃcient of Mi in fi is −1 for all i. By these observations, it follows that there exists an upper triangular
transition matrix from the vectors in J ∗ into the vectors in K0 with nonzero diagonal entries. These diagonal
entries are precisely the scalar coeﬃcients of M i for all i. These coeﬃcients are all nonzero since q is assumed
to be not a sixth root of unity. Since the vectors in J ∗ are linearly independent, the existence of a transition
matrix just described implies that the vectors in K0 are also linearly independent.
(cid:4)

Theorem 7.14. Assume q is not a sixth root of unity. The standard Lie monomials of L of length at most
5 except the vectors from (129) form a basis for L5.

by the vectors

We claim that K is linearly independent. Observe that all vectors mentioned in the statement of the theorem
are in K. By Theorem 7.2, the vectors in (129) are linearly dependent on these vectors. The result follows.
We now prove our claim. We construct ﬁve more sets in a manner similar to the construction of J ∗ from
J 1
4 and to that of K0 from J ∗. The goal is that at each step, we prove that the constructed set is linearly
independent. Let K1 denote the set obtained from K0 by replacing the vectors (170) in K0 by the vectors
(175). Let K2 denote the set obtained from K1 in a similar manner until K5, which is obtained from K4
by replacing the vectors (174) in K4 by the vectors (179). Observe that K5 = K. We show that each
of K1, . . . , K5 is a linearly independent set in ∆. Apply −ad A, −ad B, −ad B, −ad A to both sides of
(110),(108),(109),(111), respectively. Write all Lie monomials in standard form. We get

[BAC] γ + k [CAB] γ = f1,
[CAB] γ = f2,
[BAB] β = f3,

(cid:2)BA2(cid:3) α = f4,

(180)

(181)

(182)
(183)

for some k ∈ F and some f1, f2, f3, f4 ∈ L. Eliminate (cid:2)BA2BC(cid:3) in (180),(182),(183) using the relation (118).

Solve the resulting system in order to obtain

[BAC] γ = g1,
[CAB] γ = g2,
[BAB] β = g3,

where each of g1, . . . , g4 ∈ L, is a linear combination of

(cid:2)BA2(cid:3) α = g4,

(187)

[[CAB] , [BA]] , [[BAC] , [BA]] , [[BAB] , [CA]] ,(cid:2)(cid:2)BA2(cid:3) , [CB](cid:3) ,

together with the vectors in K0. We use the equations (184) to (187) to construct a transtion matrix T1
from the vectors in K0 into those in K1. Index the columns of T1 such that the last 4 correspond to (170),
while index the rows such that the last 4 correspond to (175). We ﬁnd that T1 has the form

0 L1 (cid:21)
T1 = (cid:20) I1 U1

where I1 is an identity matrix, U1 is some matrix with 4 columns, and L1 is a 4 × 4 matrix, with

det L1 = −

1

2(q + q−1)2(q − q−1)8 6= 0,

which implies that det T1 6= 0. Thus, K1 is linearly independent. For 2 ≤ i ≤ 5, we can also construct a
transtion matrix Ti from the vectors in Ki−1 into those in Ki in a similar manner. The equations that can
be used to construct Ti are also derived from (106) to (111) with the application of the appropriate map
ad X where X ∈ {A, B, C}. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that Ti can be partitioned into four matrices similar to
T1, and that if we denote the bottom right partition as Li, then

1

(q − q−1)7 = − det L2 = det L4

1

(q − q−1)8 = − det L3 = − det L5

6= 0,

6= 0,

which imply that Ti is invertible for 2 ≤ i ≤ 5. Therefore, K5 = K is a linearly independent set in ∆.
