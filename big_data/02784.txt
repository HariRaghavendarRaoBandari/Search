HARDY’S THEOREM FOR GABOR TRANSFORM

ASHISH BANSAL AND AJAY KUMAR

Abstract. We establish analogues of Hardy’s theorem for Gabor trans-
form on locally compact abelian groups, Euclidean motion group and
several general classes of nilpotent Lie groups which include Heisenberg
groups, thread-like nilpotent Lie groups, 2-NPC nilpotent Lie groups
and low-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups.

1. Introduction

The Hardy’s uncertainty principle states that a non-zero integrable function

f on R and its Fourier transform bf cannot both be compactly supported.
For f ∈ L2(R), the Fourier transform bf is given by

f (x) e−2πiξx dx.

The following theorem of Hardy (see [9] for proof) makes the above state-
ment more precise:

bf (ξ) =ZR

Theorem 1.1. Let f be a measurable function on R such that

(i) |f (x)| ≤ Ce−aπx2
(ii) |bf (ξ)| ≤ Ce−bπξ2

, for all x ∈ R,
, for all ξ ∈ R,

where a, b and C are positive constants. If ab > 1, then f = 0 a.e.

The Hardy’s theorem has been proved for Fourier transform in the setting
of Rn and Heisenberg group Hn (see [17]), locally compact abelian groups
and some classes of solvable Lie groups (see [1]), Euclidean motion group
(see [16, 18]), nilpotent Lie groups (see [2, 10, 13, 14, 19]) and non-compact
connected semisimple Lie groups with ﬁnite centre (see [15]). For detailed
survey of uncertainty principles for Fourier transform, refer to [7].
Over the last many decades the Fourier transform was an indispensable tool
in applied mathematics, especially in signal processing.
It has also been
recognised that global Fourier transform is of little practical value in ana-
lyzing the frequency spectrum of a long signal. So there is a necessity of
the notion of frequency analysis that is local in time, in other words, a joint
time-frequency analysis. In recent times, Gabor transform is one of the tools

that has established itself in this direction. The approach used in this tech-
nique is cutting the signal into segments using a smooth window-function
(usually square integrable function) and then computing the Fourier trans-
form separately on each smaller segment.
It results in a two-dimensional
representation of the signal.
Let ψ ∈ L2(R) be a ﬁxed function usually called a window function. The Ga-
bor transform of a function f ∈ L2(R) with respect to the window function
ψ is deﬁned by

such that

Gψf : R ×bR → C
f (x) ψ(x − t) e−2πiξx dx,

Gψf (t, ξ) =ZR

for all (t, ξ) ∈ R ×bR.

The Hardy’s theorem for Gabor transform on Rn has been established in
[8]. The continuous Gabor transform for second countable, unimodular and
type I group has been deﬁned in [6], a brief description of which is given
in section 2.
In section 3, the Hardy’s theorem for Gabor transform on
a second countable, locally compact, abelian group has been established.
An analogue of Hardy’s theorem for Gabor transform on Euclidean motion
group has been proved in the next section. In the last section, we shall prove
Hardy’s theorem for Gabor transform on several general classes of nilpotent
Lie groups for which kπξ(f )kHS has a particular form. These include Heisen-
berg groups, thread-like nilpotent Lie groups, 2-NPC nilpotent Lie groups
and several low-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups.

2. Continuous Gabor Transform

Let G be a second countable, unimodular group of type I. Let dx denote

the Haar measure on G and dπ the Plancherel measure on bG. For each
(x, π) ∈ G × bG, we deﬁne

H(x,π) = π(x)HS(Hπ),

where π(x)HS(Hπ) = {π(x)T : T ∈ HS(Hπ)}. It can be easily seen that
H(x,π) forms a Hilbert space with the inner product given by
hπ(x)T, π(x)SiH(x,π) = tr (S∗T ) = hT, SiHS(Hπ ).

Also, H(x,π) = HS(Hπ) for all (x, π) ∈ G×bG. The family {H(x,π)}(x,π)∈G× bG
of Hilbert spaces indexed by G × bG is a ﬁeld of Hilbert spaces over G × bG.
Let H2(G × bG) denote the direct integral of {H(x,π)}(x,π)∈G× bG with respect
F on G × bG such that
kFk2

(x,π) dx dπ < ∞.

HARDY’S THEOREM FOR GABOR TRANSFORM

One can observe that H2(G×bG) forms a Hilbert space with the inner product

given by

tr [F (x, π)K(x, π)∗] dx dπ.

hF, KiH2(G× bG) =ZG× bG

Cc(G) will denote the set of all continuous complex-valued functions on G
with compact supports. Let f ∈ Cc(G) and ψ be a ﬁxed function in L2(G).
For (x, π) ∈ G × bG, the continuous Gabor Transform of f with respect to
the window function ψ can be deﬁned as a measurable ﬁeld of operators on
G × bG by

f (y) ψ(x−1y) π(y)∗ dy.

(2.1)

Gψf (x, π) :=ZG

The operator-valued integral (2.1) is considered in the weak-sense, i.e., for

each (x, π) ∈ G × bG and ξ, η ∈ Hπ, we have

hGψf (x, π)ξ, ηi =ZG

f (y) ψ(x−1y) hπ(y)∗ξ, ηi dy.

One can verify that Gψf (x, π) is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator for all x ∈ G
and for almost all π ∈ bG. As in [6], for f ∈ Cc(G) and a window function
ψ ∈ L2(G), we have
It means that the continuous Gabor transform Gψ : Cc(G) → H2(G × bG)
of H2(G × bG) which we still denote by Gψ and this extension satisﬁes (2.2)
for each f ∈ L2(G).

deﬁned by f 7→ Gψf is a multiple of an isometry. So, we can extend Gψ
uniquely to a bounded linear operator from L2(G) into a closed subspace H

kGψfkH2(G× bG) = kψk2 kfk2.

(2.2)

3. Locally Compact Abelian Groups

Throughout this section, we shall consider G to be a second countable,

locally compact, abelian group and bG the dual group of G. For z ∈ G and
ω ∈ bG, we deﬁne the translation operator Tz on L2(G) as

(Tzf )(y) = f (z−1y)

and the modulation operator Mω on L2(G) as

(Mωf )(y) = f (y) ω(y),

where f ∈ L2(G) and y ∈ G. In the next lemma, we list some properties of
Gabor transform which can be veriﬁed easily, so we omit the proofs.
Lemma 3.1. Let f, ψ ∈ L2(G). For x, z ∈ G and γ, ω ∈ bG, we have

(i) Gψf (x, γ) = γ(x−1) Gf ψ(x−1, γ−1).
(ii) Gψ(MωTzf )(x, γ) = (ω−1γ)(z−1) Gψf (z−1x, ω−1γ).
(iii) G(Mω Tzψ)(MωTzf )(x, γ) = ω(x) γ(z−1) Gψf (x, γ).

F (x, γ) = γ(x) Gψf (x, γ) Gψf (x−1, γ−1),

Lemma 3.2. Let f, ψ ∈ L2(G) and F : G × bG → C be deﬁned as
where (x, γ) ∈ G × bG. For (ω, z) ∈ bG × G, we have bF (ω, z) = F (z−1, ω).
Proof. For z ∈ G and ω ∈ bG, by Lemma 3.1, we have

The structure theory of locally compact abelian groups suggests that G
decomposes into a direct product G = Rn × H, where n ≥ 0 and H contains
a compact open subgroup. So the connected component of identity of G
in non-compact if and only if n ≥ 1. Let G be a locally compact abelian
group such that the connected component of identity is non-compact. We

prove the following analogue of Hardy’s theorem for Gabor transform:

can write G = R × K, where K = Rn−1 × H, and bG = bR × bK. We now
Theorem 3.3. Let G be a locally compact abelian group such that the
connected component of identity is non-compact. Let f, ψ ∈ L2(G) such
that

|Gψf (x, k, ξ, γ)| ≤ e−π(ax2+bξ2)/2 ϕ(k) η(γ),

If ab > 1, then either f = 0 a.e. or ψ = 0 a.e.

for all (x, k) ∈ G = R × K, (ξ, γ) ∈ bG =bR × bK, where a, b are positive real
numbers; ϕ and η are bounded functions in L2(K) and L2(bK) respectively.
Proof. For (x, k), (z, t) ∈ R × K and (ξ, γ), (ζ, χ) ∈bR × bK, we deﬁne
F(z,t,ζ,χ)(x, k, ξ, γ) = e2πiξx γ(k) Gψ(Mζ,χTz,tf )(x, k, ξ, γ)
× Gψ(Mζ,χTz,tf )(−x, k−1,−ξ, γ−1).

HARDY’S THEOREM FOR GABOR TRANSFORM

The function F(z,t,ζ,χ) is continuous and is in L1(R × K × bR × bK). By

Lemma 3.2, we have

\F(z,t,ζ,χ)(ω, δ, y, v) = F(z,t,ζ,χ)(−y, v−1, ω, δ).

Using Lemma 3.1(ii), we have

F(z,t,ζ,χ)(x, k, ξ, γ)
= e2πiξx γ(k) e−2πi(ξ−ζ)z (χ−1γ)(t−1) Gψf (x − z, t−1k, ξ − ζ, χ−1γ)

× e−2πi(−ξ−ζ)z (χ−1γ−1)(t−1) Gψf (−x − z, t−1k−1,−ξ − ζ, χ−1γ−1),

which implies

|F(z,t,ζ,χ)(x, k, ξ, γ)|
= |Gψf (x − z, t−1k, ξ − ζ, χ−1γ)| |Gψf (−x − z, t−1k−1,−ξ − ζ, χ−1γ−1)|
≤ e−π[a(x−z)2+b(ξ−ζ)2]/2 ϕ(t−1k) η(χ−1γ) e−π[a(−x−z)2+b(−ξ−ζ)2]/2 ϕ(t−1k−1) η(χ−1γ−1)
= e−πa(x2+z2) e−πb(ξ2+ζ 2) ϕ(t−1k) η(χ−1γ) ϕ(t−1k−1) η(χ−1γ−1)
= e−πax2

β(z,t,ζ,χ)(k, ξ, γ),

β(z,t,ζ,χ)(k, ξ, γ) = e−πaz2

where β(z,t,ζ,χ) is a function on K ×bR × bK = S (say) given by
Using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, it follows that β(z,t,ζ,χ) ∈ L1(S) ∩ L2(S).
Also, | \F(z,t,ζ,χ)(ω, δ, y, v)| = |F(z,t,ζ,χ)(−y, v−1, ω, δ)|

e−πb(ξ2+ζ 2) ϕ(t−1k) η(χ−1γ) ϕ(t−1k−1) η(χ−1γ−1).

≤ e−πa(y2+z2) e−πb(ω2+ζ 2) ϕ(t−1v−1) η(χ−1δ) ϕ(t−1v) η(χ−1δ−1)
= e−πbω2

ρ(z,t,ζ,χ)(δ, y, v),

ϕ(t−1v−1) η(χ−1δ) ϕ(t−1v) η(χ−1δ−1).

ρ(z,t,ζ,χ)(δ, y, v) = e−πa(y2+z2) e−πbζ 2

where ρ(z,t,ζ,χ) is a function on bS = bK × R × K given by
Again, using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have ρ(z,t,ζ,χ) ∈ L1(bS) ∩ L2(bS)

and is also bounded.
Thus, by [1, Theorem 1.1], we have F(z,t,ζ,χ) ≡ 0 for all (z, t, ζ, χ), whenever
ab > 1.
Since, F(−z,t−1,−ζ,χ−1)(0, e, 0, I) = e4πiζz χ(t)2 Gψf (z, t, ζ, χ).
So, Gψf ≡ 0, whenever ab > 1.
By (2.2), we have kψk2 kfk2 = 0 which implies either f = 0 a.e. or ψ = 0
a.e., whenever ab > 1.

4. Euclidean Motion Group M (n)

Consider the Euclidean motion group M (n) = Rn ⋊SO(n) with the group

law given by

(z, k)(w, k′) = (z + k · w, kk′),

the irreducible unitary representations of M (n) relevant for the Plancherel
formula are parametrized (upto unitary equivalence) by pairs (λ, σ), where

for z, w ∈ Rn and k, k′ ∈ SO(n). Let K = SO(n), then M = SO(n− 1) can
be considered as a subgroup of K leaving the point e1 = (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) ﬁxed.
We retain the notations of [16]. Let cM denote the unitary dual of M . All
λ > 0 and σ ∈ cM .
Given σ ∈ cM realized on a Hilbert space Hσ of dimension dσ, consider
L2(K, σ) =(cid:26)ϕ | ϕ : K → Mdσ×dσ ,Z kϕ(k)k2 dk < ∞,

the space

ϕ(uk) = σ(u)ϕ(k), for u ∈ M and k ∈ K} .

Note that L2(K, σ) is a Hilbert space under the inner product

hϕ, ψi =ZK

tr(ϕ(k)ψ(k)∗) dk.

L2(K, σ) as follows:

For each λ > 0 and σ ∈ cM , we can deﬁne a representation πλ,σ of M (n) on
For ϕ ∈ L2(K, σ), (z, k) ∈ M (n),

πλ,σ(z, k)ϕ(u) = eiλhu−1·e1,zi ϕ(uk),

for u ∈ K.
If ϕj(k) are the column vectors of ϕ ∈ L2(K, σ), then ϕj(uk) = σ(u)ϕj(k)
for all u ∈ M . Therefore, L2(K, σ) can be written as the direct sum of dσ
copies of H(K, σ), where

H(K, σ) =(cid:26)ϕ | ϕ : K → Cdσ ,Z kϕ(k)k2 dk < ∞,

ϕ(uk) = σ(u)ϕ(k), for u ∈ M and k ∈ K} .

It can be shown that πλ,σ restricted to H(K, σ) is an irreducible unitary
representation of M (n). Moreover, any irreducible unitary representation of
M (n) which is inﬁnite dimensional is unitarily equivalent to one and only
one πλ,σ.
The Fourier transform of f ∈ L2(M (n)) is given by,

f (z, k) πλ,σ(z, k)∗ dz dk.

bf (λ, σ) = ZM (n)

bf (λ, σ) is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator on H(K, σ).

A solid harmonic of degree m is a polynomial which is homogeneous of
degree m and whose Laplacian is zero. The set of all such polynomials will
be denoted by Hm and the restrictions of elements of Hm to Sn−1 is denoted
by Sm. By choosing an orthonormal basis {gmj : j = 1, 2, . . . , dm} of Sm for
each m = 0, 1, 2, . . ., we get an orthonormal basis for L2(Sn−1).
The Haar measure on M (n) is dg = dz dk, where dz is Lebesgue measure
on Rn and dk is the normalized Haar measure on SO(n). We now prove the
following analogue of Hardy’s theorem for Gabor transform on Euclidean
motion group:
Theorem 4.1. Let f, ψ ∈ L2(M (n)) be such that

HS dµ(ξ),

f ∈ L1 ∩ L2(G),

where kπξ(f )kHS denotes the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of πξ(f ) and dg is the
Haar measure on G.
A careful reading of the proof of Hardy’s theorem for connected, simply
connected nilpotent Lie groups (see [10]) and for connected nilpotent Lie
groups with non-compact centre (see [2]) yield the following:

Theorem 5.1. Let G = exp g be a connected and simply connected nilpo-
tent Lie group or a connected nilpotent Lie group with non-compact centre.
Let a, b and C be positive real numbers, and suppose that f : G → C is a
measurable function such that

(i) |f (x)| ≤ Ce−aπkxk2
, for all x ∈ G,
(ii) | Pf(ξ)|1/2 kπξ(f )kHS ≤ Ce−bπkξk2

If ab > 1, then f = 0 a.e.

, for all ξ ∈ W.

We shall consider the case in which W takes the following form:
W = {ξ = (ξ1, . . . , ξn) ∈ g∗ : ξj = 0 for (n − k) values of j with | Pf(ξ)| 6= 0}.
We denote the non-vanishing variables by ξp1, ξp2, . . . , ξpk , where p1 < p2 <
. . . < pk. Without loss of generality, we may assume that p1 = 1.
We denote the vanishing variables by ξm1 , ξm2 , . . . , ξmn−k , where k > 0 and
m1 < m2 < . . . < mn−k.
Let A = {p1, p2, . . . , pk} and B = {m1, m2, . . . , mn−k} be the set of indices
corresponding to the non-vanishing and vanishing variables respectively.
We consider the class of groups for which the Hilbert-Schmidt norm kπξ(f )kHS
for all ξ ∈ W and f ∈ L2(G) has the following form:
kπξ(f )k2
| Pf(ξ)|ZRn−k |F (f ◦ exp) (ξ1 + Q1, . . . , ξn + Qn)|2 dξm1 . . . dξmn−k ,
= |h(ξ)|

(∗)
where F denotes the Fourier transform on Rk, h(ξ) is a polynomial in ξ and
the functions Q1 = 0, Qk = Qk(ξ1, ξ2, . . . , ξk−1) with 2 ≤ k ≤ n. Without
loss of generality, we can assume that Qj = 0 for all j ∈ B.
In this case, the continuous Gabor Transform of f with respect to the window
function ψ can be deﬁned as follows:

HS

Gψf (x, ξ) :=ZG

f (y) ψ(x−1y) πξ(y)∗ dy,

where (x, ξ) ∈ G × W.
We now prove the following analogue of Hardy’s theorem for Gabor trans-
form on G:

2. For 2-NPC nilpotent Lie groups (see [3]), let {0} = g0 ⊂ g1 ⊂ ··· ⊂
gn = g be a Jordan-H¨older sequence in g such that gm = z(g) and
h = gn−2. Let us consider the ideal [g, gm+1] of g which is one or two
dimensional in g. We discuss the two cases separately:
(a) dim [g, gm+1] = 2.

In this case, for every basis {X1, X2} of h in g and Y1 ∈ gm+1 \ z(g),
the vectors Z1 = [X1, Y1] and Z2 = [X2, Y1] are linearly independent

and lie in the center of g.
Assume that g1 = R-span{Z1}, g2 = R-span{Z1, Z2}. Let Z3, . . . , Zm
be some vectors such that z(g) = R-span{Z1, . . . , Zm} and B =
{Z1, . . . , Zn} a Jordan-H¨older basis of g chosen as follows:
(i) z(g) = R-span{Z1, . . . , Zm}
(ii) h = R-span{Z1, . . . , Zn−2}
(iii) g = R-span{Z1, . . . , Zn−2, X1 = Zn−1, X2 = Zn}.
For m1 = m + 1 and m + 2 ≤ m2 ≤ n − 2, we denote Zm1 =
Zm+1 = Y1, Zm2 = Y2. These vectors can be chosen such that
ξ1 = ξ([X1, Y1]) 6= 0, ξ2,2 = ξ([X2, Y2]) 6= 0, for all ξ ∈ W, where

W = {ξ = (ξ1, ξ2, . . . , ξm, 0, 0, ξm+3, ξm+4, . . . , ξn−2, 0, 0) : ξj ∈ R,| Pf(ξ)| 6= 0}.

Also, we have Pf(ξ) = ξ(Z1) ξ([X2, Y2]) − ξ([X1, Y2]) ξ(Z2) and
kπξ(f )kHS is given by

a polynomial function with respect to the variables t = (t1, t2) and
ξm+1, . . . , ξj−1 and rational in the variables ξ1, . . . , ξm.

(b) dim [g, gm+1] = 1.

In this case, we have Pf(ξ) = ξ([X1, Y1]) · ξ([X2, Y2]) and

W = {ξ = (ξ1, ξ2, . . . , ξm, 0, ξm+2, . . . , ξm+d+1, 0, ξm+d+3, . . . , ξn−2, 0, 0)
