Most of the information on our cosmos stems from either late-time observations or the imprint
of early-time inhomogeneities on the cosmic microwave background. We explore to what extent
early modiﬁcations of gravity, which become signiﬁcant after recombination but then decay towards
the present, can be constrained by current cosmological observations. For the evolution of the
gravitational modiﬁcation, we adopt the decaying mode of a hybrid-metric Palatini f (R) gravity
model which is designed to reproduce the standard cosmological background expansion history
and due to the decay of the modiﬁcation is naturally compatible with Solar-System tests. We
embed the model in the eﬀective ﬁeld theory description of Horndeski scalar-tensor gravity with
an early-time decoupling of the gravitational modiﬁcation. Since the quasistatic approximation for
the perturbations in the model breaks down at high redshifts, where modiﬁcations remain relevant,
we introduce a computationally eﬃcient correction to describe the evolution of the scalar ﬁeld
ﬂuctuation in this regime. We compare the decaying early-time modiﬁcation against geometric
probes and recent Planck measurements and ﬁnd no evidence for such eﬀects in the observations.
Current data constrains the scalar ﬁeld value at |fR(z = zon)| (cid:46) 10−2 for modiﬁcations introduced
at redshifts zon ∼ (500 − 1000) with present-day value |fR0| (cid:46) 10−8. Finally, we comment on
constraints that will be achievable with future 21 cm surveys and gravitational wave experiments.

INTRODUCTION

The simplest explanation for the late-time accelerated
expansion of our Universe is a cosmological constant Λ
as adopted in the standard model of cosmology, ΛCDM,
where it is the main energy constituent of the cosmos
at present. Despite being in good agreement with super-
novae observations [1–4], measurements of the cosmic mi-
crowave background (CMB) [5–7], and large-scale struc-
ture data [8], cosmologists cannot account for the dif-
ference between the theoretically-expected and observed
value of Λ. The observed cosmological constant is ap-
proximately 60 orders of magnitude smaller than pre-
dicted by quantum ﬁeld theory calculations (for a review
on Λ, see Ref. [9]).

In light of this discrepancy, new physics may be in
order to account for the major component of our Uni-
verse, usually labeled dark energy. Some theories, such
as quintessence, k-essence, and others, propose the pres-
ence of a scalar ﬁeld rolling in a potential (see Ref. [10]
and references therein for a comprehensive review). Oth-
ers hypothesize that General Relativity (GR) may fail
on cosmological scales, usually proposing corrections to
the Einstein-Hilbert action. Examples of such modi-
ﬁed gravity theories are Galileon models [11], the Fab
Four [12], f (R) models [13], Brans–Dicke scalar–tensor
theory [14], and many more. However, these models
do not necessarily provide a genuine alternative to dark
energy or a cosmological constant. Even in Horndeski

gravity [15] (the most general scalar-tensor theory with
at most second-order derivatives in the equations of mo-
tion), self-acceleration cannot be made compatible with
cosmological observations [16]. Nevertheless the models
are worthwhile exploring as the dark energy ﬁeld may be
universally non-minimally coupled to matter ﬁelds, mod-
ifying gravity, or the models can be adopted to conduct
tests of gravity. For reviews on dark energy and modiﬁed
gravity, see, e.g., Refs. [17–19].

In this paper, we explore to what extent modiﬁcations
of gravity that may arise after recombination and decay
towards the present can be constrained with current cos-
mological observations. For this purpose, we consider
hybrid metric-Palatini gravity [20, 21], where the usual
Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian is modiﬁed with a function
of the Palatini Ricci scalar, f (R). This theory has been
studied in the cosmological context in Refs. [22, 23] and
modiﬁcations of galactic dynamics have been considered
in Ref. [24]. Constraints on hybrid metric-Palatini mod-
els from cosmological background observations have been
inferred in Ref. [25]. An interesting aspect of the models
tested under the hybrid metric-Palatini formalism is that
the additional scalar degree of freedom introduced does
not need to acquire a large mass in high-density regions
to pass the stringent Solar-System constraints [20].

The speciﬁc f (R) model we adopt for our study
was introduced in Ref. [26] and is designed to yield a
background evolution indistinguishable from ΛCDM.
This recovery comes at the expense of a departure from
the standard model at early times, with f (R) diﬀering
from the actual Λ at high redshifts and tending indis-
tinguishably closer to it towards the present. The same
characteristics are observed for the scalar ﬁeld: it tends
to zero as it approaches the present from a maximum

starting value at a speciﬁed initial high redshift after
recombination. Designer f (R) can therefore be consid-
ered a decaying early modiﬁed gravity model. One of
its advantages is that it allows a clear separation of the
modiﬁcations introduced between linear perturbations
and background eﬀects. It has been shown in Ref. [26]
that the ratio (and slip) between the metric potentials is
expected to oscillate at high redshifts, but the respective
observational eﬀects have not yet been studied in detail.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II A, we
brieﬂy discuss the concept of early-time decaying mod-
iﬁed gravity and introduce the hybrid metric-Palatini
model we will investigate.
In Sec. II B, we reproduce
the relevant linearly perturbed modiﬁed Einstein equa-
tions in the Newtonian gauge. We explicitly show how
the breakdown of the quasistatic approximation for the
evolution of the scalar ﬁeld ﬂuctuation occurs at high
redshifts. This failure motivates an analytic correction
to the quasistatic approximation to accurately describe
the evolution of the slip between the metric potentials
in this high-curvature regime.
In Secs. II C and II D,
we describe an embedding of the designer hybrid metric-
Palatini model in the eﬀective ﬁeld theory (reviewed in
Ref. [27]) of Horndeski scalar-tensor theory with a high-
redshift decoupling of the modiﬁcation to comply with
stringent high-curvature constraints from the CMB. In
Sec. III, we infer constraints on the early-time decaying
modiﬁed gravity model using current cosmological obser-
vations. Lastly, in Sec. IV we conclude with some ﬁnal
thoughts and remarks, also providing an outlook for fu-
ture cosmological constraints on the model. For com-
pleteness, in the appendices we provide details on our
numerical computations and approximations adopted to
describe oscillations in the scalar ﬁeld ﬂuctuations.

II. A DECAYING EARLY MODIFICATION OF

GRAVITY

The main purpose of this work is to explore constraints
on early modiﬁed gravity, with modiﬁcations from GR
arising at high redshifts and being suppressed as we ap-
proach the present time. We start by describing the gen-
eral dynamics of the test model we will embed in Horn-
deski theory: the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity. This
class of theories emanate from considering the metric and
the connection as independent variables.

where κ2 = 8πG and we set c = 1. Sm is the stan-

ﬁned in terms of the metric elements, gµν, and a torsion-
less independent connection, ˆΓ, through

For a statistically spatially homogeneous and isotropic
universe with Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) met-
ric, ds2 = −dt2 + a2(t)d(cid:126)x2, the modiﬁed Einstein equa-
tions and the dynamical hybrid-metric scalar ﬁeld equa-

ond and third derivatives of f (R) with respect to R.

tial equations that determines the background evolution
for speciﬁed f (R). Note that we recover the standard
Friedmann equations of ΛCDM in the limit of fR → 0.

Designer f (R) Model

We brieﬂy review the designer hybrid-metric Palatini
model that we will adopt to describe the evolution of the
decaying early modiﬁcation of gravity and its observa-
tional constraints in Sec. III. This model was ﬁrst intro-
duced in Ref. [26], and it allows one to retrieve a family of
f (R) functions that produce a background evolution in-
distinguishable to ΛCDM from solving the second-order
diﬀerential equation

early-modiﬁed gravity model that satisﬁes Solar-System
constraints [20].

Having a hybrid metric-Palatini model that recovers
a ΛCDM-like background evolution allows to separate
the modiﬁcations introduced between linear perturba-
tions from background eﬀects.
In fact, possible devia-
tions at the background level from ΛCDM have already
been tested against observational data in Ref. [25] for
other choices of the f (R) function that do not recover the
ΛCDM expansion history. Modiﬁcations introduced in
the linear cosmological perturbations have not yet been
tested for f (R) gravity. Hence, the designer model dis-
cussed here suits this purpose.

B. Linear Perturbations in f (R) Gravity

We brieﬂy review the main aspects concerning the
evolution of linear perturbations in the hybrid metric-
Palatini theory. For the full set of linearly perturbed
Einstein and scalar ﬁeld equations we direct the reader
to Ref. [26]. Typically for modiﬁed gravity theories (how-
ever, see Refs. [28, 29]), the hybrid metric-Palatini theory
introduces a non-zero slip between the gravitational po-
tentials in the Newtonian gauge, Φ = δg00/(2g00) and
Ψ = −δgii/(2gii). Neglecting any anisotropic contribu-
tion from matter ﬁelds, the anisotropy equation becomes

Φ − Ψ =

δfR

,

(10)

where δfR is the linear perturbation of the scalar ﬁeld
with its background value denoted by fR. The evolution
of δfR is dictated by the linear perturbation of the scalar
ﬁeld equation of motion,

the stress-energy tensor, T = −ρ + 3p, and for this equa-
tion only, the overdots represent derivatives with respect
to conformal time τ with dt = a dτ , and H ≡ aH.

It has been shown in Ref. [26] that the evolution of
δfR is characterized by quick oscillations around zero,
which end up reﬂecting in the ratio between the New-
tonian potentials, γ ≡ Φ/Ψ. These oscillations are scale
dependent, oscillating faster and with larger amplitude at
smaller scales. They can produce noticeable oscillations
at near-horizon scales, depending on the initial value of
the scalar ﬁeld at early times that, for instance, have an

where here and throughout the rest of the paper primes
represent a diﬀerentiation with respect to ln a. Eq. (7) is
obtained from setting the eﬀective equation of state weﬀ
equal to −1. The background evolution is ﬁxed through
E (a) ≡ H 2/H 2

In a ﬂat Universe, Ωeﬀ = 1− Ωm − Ωr and, for weﬀ = −1,
one recovers a ΛCDM-like background cosmology. The
initial conditions for solving Eq. (7) are set at an initial
scale factor, ai = (1 + zi)−1 (cid:28) 1, by [26]

argument of the hyperbolic tangent refers to the same
argument as in the hyperbolic cosine. Throughout the
paper we ﬁx C2 to a large value in order for the absolute
value of the hyperbolic tangent to be close to unity. C1
is then ﬁxed by choosing a value for fRi ≡ fR(z = zi).
Hence, one then just has to numerically evolve the model
using Eq. (7), and make use of the background equations
to recover further quantities of interest, such as f (R), at
each step of the iteration.

In Fig. 1 we plot the evolution of the absolute value
of fR as a function of the scale factor for diﬀerent initial
values fRi set at a redshift zi = 1000. The scalar ﬁeld
fR decays with time and is strongly suppressed as we
approach a → 1. In Sec. III it will become evident that
due to this suppression, f (R) behaves like a decaying

tion term (see Eq. (11)), these modiﬁcations eventually
get damped as one approaches a ≈ 1, becoming fairly
negligible at the present with no signs of signiﬁcant sub-
horizon modiﬁcations.

We will explore the behavior of δfR further in
Secs. II B 1 and II B 2, focusing on its subhorizon and
early-time evolution, respectively, where we will develop
accurate approximations for these regimes. In order to
test our approximations, we follow Ref. [26] and solve
the exact numerical evolution of the gravitational po-
tentials and δfR, using the linearly perturbed conser-
vation equations for the stress-energy tensor and the
ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations for the lensing potential,
Φ+ ≡ (Φ + Ψ) /2.

1. Subhorizon Approximation

We ﬁrst consider wavemodes that are deep within the
Hubble radius with wavenumber k (cid:29) aH. To describe
this limit, we adopt the quasistatic approximation, dis-
carding time derivatives of perturbations when compared
to their spatial variation. Generally, for Horndeski scalar-
tensor theories, this is a good approximation on small
scales [30]. In practice, this allows one to keep the terms

proportional to k2/(cid:0)a2H 2(cid:1) as well as those related to

the matter perturbation δρm and the scalar ﬁeld eﬀec-
tive mass m2
fR . The latter sets a modiﬁed length scale
that can be compared to that of the perturbations.
From the 0 − 0 linearly perturbed Einstein equation
in the Newtonian gauge, we obtain in the subhorizon
regime [26]

(18)

As mentioned in Sec. I, the background value of the
scalar ﬁeld is required to be small in order for the metric-
Palatini theory to avoid Solar-System tests. In these cir-
cumstances, the quasistatic modiﬁcations will be almost
unnoticeable, even if the range of the modiﬁcations, given
by the eﬀective Compton wavelength λC = 2π/mfR, is
relevant. For instance, note that for fR → 0, δfR → 0
since δfR is proportional to the background value of the
scalar ﬁeld fR in the quasistatic regime, as can be seen
in Eq. (18).
The f (R) models that have been analyzed so far [25,
26] evolve towards smaller deviations from ΛCDM as we
approach the present, with fR tending to negligible val-
ues. This renders the modiﬁcations in the quasistatic
regime subdominant, as was explicitly shown in Ref. [26]
for the designer f (R) model, with no mentionable en-
hancement of the perturbations in this regime when com-
pared to ΛCDM.

In Fig. 2 we compare the numerical evolution of the
ratio between the Newtonian potentials, γ, with its qua-
sistatic approximation,

γQS ≡ Φ
Ψ

=

k2/a2 (3 + fR) + 3m2
fR
k2/a2 (3 − fR) + 3m2

.

(19)

We see that it is an accurate approximation at late times,
as a consequence of large k/(aH) values. As we approach
the present time in our models, the subhorizon modiﬁca-
tions become suppressed, leading in turn to a very small
diﬀerence between the compared values. This accuracy
holds even when we consider larger initial displacements
for the scalar ﬁeld, fRi.

However, the quasistatic approximation breaks down
at earlier times, due to the oscillatory behavior of δfR
discussed in Sec. II B. This becomes more evident for the
smaller scales, where the amplitude of the oscillations are
larger. For large initial values of the scalar ﬁeld the er-
ror can be of order unity and decreases as we consider
smaller values for the initial displacement. Hence, for an
accurate but computationally eﬃcient description of the
evolution of γ in the designer f (R) model that is valid
across a large range of redshifts and scales, some cor-
rections must be applied to the subhorizon approxima-
tion (see Sec. III B 2). Lastly, we emphasize that in the
hybrid metric-Palatini model fR and δfR are strongly
suppressed at the present, and (Geﬀ − G)/G (cid:28) 1 at
any scale, consistent with Solar-System tests.
In con-
trast, in metric f (R) gravity, for modes well within the

given by Eq. (19). We have considered zi = 1000 and ﬁxed Ωm = 0.30.

Compton radius, we have (Geﬀ − G)/G = 4/3 at lin-
ear order, and the model needs to employ a nonlinear
chameleon mechanism [31–34] to restore Geﬀ /G → 1 at
the small scales probed by Solar-System tests. It is for
this aspect that we adopt the decaying early-time gravi-
tational modiﬁcation characterized by the hybrid metric-
Palatini model rather than the decaying mode of metric
f (R) gravity. Note that the suppression is also inde-
pendent of environment and cannot be unscreened by
environment-dependent statistical measurements of the
large-scale structure [35].

2. Early–Time Corrections

The dynamics of δfR is dictated by Eq. (11), which
is the equation of a damped harmonic oscillator with a
driving force proportional to the matter perturbation.
The frequency of the oscillation depends on the mode
wavenumber k, while the damping term is dominated by
the Hubble parameter at early times, and δfR quickly
becomes negligible towards late times, where the oscilla-
tions are no longer observable. The driving term could

deviate the equilibrium position of the oscillations. How-
ever, note that it is proportional to fR, which not only
is ﬁxed to a small value at early times as we study small
deviations from GR, but also evolves towards zero at late
times, rendering the external force term almost negligi-
ble.

Hence, rewriting Eq. (11) to depend on ln a, assuming
˙fR (cid:28) 1, but not neglecting terms proportional to

for which we attempt a solution under the Wentzel–
Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) approximation given by

w d ln a + θ0

.

(21)

We expect the approximation to be valid as long as the
adiabatic condition | ˙w| (cid:28) w2 holds, where w2 is the term
multiplying δfR in Eq. (20); and γexp is the quantity

With this approximation, it is possible to simplify w and

The details of this calculation may be found in Ap-
pendix B.

In Fig. 3 we set the initial conditions for δfR by deter-
mining θ0 such that δfR is zero at the chosen initial red-
shift zi = 1000. We note that this is completely arbitrary,
but not particularly relevant for the overall evolution of
δfR since it quickly oscillates around zero. We can then
diﬀerentiate Eq. (20) with respect to ln a and compute A
by calculating the numerical value of δf(cid:48)
R using Eq. (67)
of Ref. [26] at the same redshift.

We see in Fig. 3 that our analytical approximation
works remarkably well, considering the complexity of the
equation describing the dynamics of δfR. Even though
it may fail in predicting the exact amplitude of the oscil-
lations, the relative diﬀerence to the numerical results is
insigniﬁcantly small compared to the precision available
with current experiments. Also, it clearly encompasses
the desired dependence on the scale of the modes of the
perturbations, with a higher amplitude and frequency of
oscillation the smaller scales (higher k) one considers.

Lastly, Fig. 3 serves as further conﬁrmation of the
viability of the subhorizon approximations derived in
Sec. II B 1 at late times. As Eq. (18) dictates, δfR should

be strongly suppressed in the subhorizon regime follow-
ing the behavior of the background scalar ﬁeld value and
with k (cid:29) aH.

C. Decoupling at High Redshifts

The hybrid metric-Palatini modiﬁcation of gravity
needs to decouple at high redshifts in order not to vio-
late stringent high-curvature constraints from the CMB.
However, we wish to determine below which redshift zon
the modiﬁcation can be introduced and to which degree a
decaying early-time modiﬁcation motivated by the evo-
lution of hybrid metric-Palatini gravity at z ≤ zon can
be constrained by the CMB radiation observed today. In
order to formulate an explicit realization of the decay-
ing early modiﬁed gravity model, we embed the designer
hybrid metric-Palatini scenario with high-redshift decou-
pling in Horndeski scalar-tensor theory [15] using the ef-
fective ﬁeld theory of cosmic acceleration (see Ref. [27]
for a review).

D. Embedding in Horndeski Gravity and Eﬀective

Field Theory

We now proceed to outline how the designer hybrid
metric-Palatini model, detailed in Sec. II A, can be em-
bedded in the Horndeski scalar-tensor theory. We use
the eﬀective ﬁeld theory of cosmic acceleration, where we
adopt the notation of Ref. [36]. Given the ΛCDM back-
ground expansion history of our designer hybrid metric-
Palatini model, its modiﬁcations are fully speciﬁed by
the eﬀective parameters characterizing the linear pertur-

bilities may be model dependent and should be studied
in more detail for other choices of f (R). For complete-
ness, we also verify the stability of tensor modes [36] with

that in f (R) models, the propagation speed of gravita-

III. OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS

metric–Palatini gravity. Note that αX,model(z > zon) = 0
recovers a ΛCDM universe at high redshifts, avoiding the
stringent high-curvature constraints at very early times.
Stability of the background solution of the Horndeski

model with respect to the scalar mode requires [36]

Having fully speciﬁed a theoretically consistent decay-
ing early modiﬁed gravity model in Sec. II, we now deter-
mine the observational eﬀects and constraints that can be
set on early gravitational modiﬁcations with current cos-
mological data (Sec. III B). We also provide an outlook
of constraints achievable with future surveys (Sec. III C).

1. Geometric Probes

The comparison between the luminosity magnitudes of
high-redshift to low-redshift supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia)
provides a relative distance measure aﬀected by the Uni-
verse’s expansion rate. Complementary absolute distance
measures are obtained from measuring the local Hubble
constant H0 and the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO)
in the clustering of galaxies. These probes constrain the
cosmological background evolution and since the f (R)
models considered here are designed to match the ΛCDM
expansion history, they only serve to constrain the stan-
dard cosmological parameters and prevent degeneracies
with the eﬀect of the additional scalar degree of freedom
on the ﬂuctuations.

2. Cosmic Microwave Background

In addition to the geometic probes described in
Sec. III A 1, the acoustic peaks in the CMB also con-
tain information on the absolute distance to the last-
scattering surface. These peaks are aﬀected by early-
time departures from GR at high curvature, i.e., in the
case of f (R) modiﬁcations, where zon is suﬃciently large.
Gravitational modiﬁcations can generally further mani-
fest themselves in the CMB temperature and polariza-
tion via secondary anisotropies. For details on the nu-

8

tial Φ will be displaced toward larger or smaller values
compared to ΛCDM, leading to the shift we observe in
the power spectrum. Then, at low (cid:96), we have the tra-
ditional increase in power due to the integrated Sachs-
Wolfe (ISW) eﬀect in the presence of late-time dark en-
ergy. Our model clearly mimics ΛCDM due to the fact
that we ﬁx the background evolution to match the stan-
dard cosmological scenario, even if the power can be de-
viated toward lower or smaller values due to the Sachs-
Wolfe eﬀect discussed before.

Lastly, we have what is probably the most discern-
ing eﬀect on the CMB TT power spectrum. When we
introduce the oscillations at zon = 1000, we notice a sig-
niﬁcant decrease in the amplitude of the ﬁrst peak. Tra-
ditionally, at early times, the non-negligible presence of
radiation after the epoch of last-scattering can cause a
decay of the gravitational potentials before these become
constant, contributing to an early ISW eﬀect that can in-
ﬂuence the amplitude and position of the peaks. There-
fore, if we allow modiﬁed gravity to be relevant close to
the epoch of recombination, we not only modify this de-
cay but also cause additional variation, inﬂuencing the
acoustic phenomenology of the CMB. Of course, as we
test lower valus of zon, this eﬀect becomes increasingly
negligible.

B. Cosmological Constraints

Before presenting the current cosmological constraints
on decaying early modiﬁed gravity, we brieﬂy describe
the cosmological datasets we use in our analysis. We
then give an outlook on constraints that can be obtained
with 21 cm surveys and gravitational wave observations.

1. Datasets

For the SN Ia luminosity-redshift relation, we use
the dataset compiled in the Joint Lightcurve Analysis
(JLA) [38]. This includes records from the full three years
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) survey plus the
“C11 compilation” assembled by Conley et al. (2011);
comprising supernovae from the Supernovae Legacy Sur-
vey (SNLS), the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and sev-
eral nearby experiments. This whole sample consists of
740 SNe Ia.

For H0, we include information provided by the Wide
Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on HST. The objective of this
project was to determine the Hubble constant from op-
tical and infrared observations of over 600 Cepheid vari-
ables in the host galaxies of 8 SNe Ia, which provide
the calibration for a magnitude-redshift relation based
on 240 SNe Ia [39]. Hence, we use the gaussian prior of
H0 = 73.8 ± 2.4 km s−1 Mpc−1.

We also use the BAO observations from the 6dF
Galaxy Redshift Survey (6dFGRS) at low redshift zeﬀ =
0.106 [40], as well as DR7 MGS from SDSS at zeﬀ = 0.15,

merical computation of these eﬀects in the designer hy-
brid metric-Palatini model, we refer the reader to Ap-
pendix A.

In Fig. 4, we show the predictions for the CMB temper-
ature anisotropy power spectrum (TT) for three diﬀerent
choices of zon. Hence, we introduce the oscillations be-
tween the Newtonian potentials in distinct epochs of the
cosmological evolution which in turn produces diﬀerent
eﬀects in the observed power spectrum. The ﬁrst im-
mediate observation is that, the later we introduce these
oscillations, the less signiﬁcant is their impact on the TT
power spectrum. This is mainly due to the fact that,
at later epochs, the amplitude of the oscillations have
already been considerably damped out, reducing their
eﬀect on the TT power spectrum.

The second noticeable modiﬁcation of the spectrum
is in the Sachs-Wolfe plateau, on scales around l < 100,
where we observe a shift towards higher or smaller values
compared to ΛCDM. The Sachs-Wolfe eﬀect, resulting
from a combination of gravitational redshift and intrinsic
temperature ﬂuctuations at angular last-scattering, can
lead to a variation of the temperature power spectrum
like [37]

∝ δΦ,

where δΦ corresponds to the variation of the gravita-
tional potential Φ. The designer hybrid-metric Palatini
model introduces modiﬁcations close to the surface of
last-scattering. Therefore, depending on the redshift we
choose to start the oscillations, the Newtonian poten-

TABLE I. Current constraints (95% C.L.) on fR(zi = 1000)
from the combination of surveys discussed in Sec. III B 1. Note
that models with a positive sign of fR suﬀer from a ghost
instability (see Sec. II D) and models with zon = 100 can-
not be constrained within the prior |fRi| < 0.1 required for
the viability of the approximations performed in Sec. II B 2.
However, a constraint of |fRi| (cid:46) 10−3 on all models will be
achievable with 21 cm intensity mapping (see Sec. III C). We
also present constraints on the value of fR at the redshift of
decoupling, zon, and at the present time, z = 0.

from the value-added galaxy catalogs hosted by NYU
(NYU-VAGC) [41] and the BAO signal from the Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) DR11 at zeﬀ =
0.57 [42].

Lastly, we use the Planck 2015 data for the CMB. The
Planck temperature and polarization and Planck lens-
ing likelihood codes may be found in the Planck Legacy
Archive [43].

2. Constraints

Using the datasets described in Sec. III B 1, we con-
duct an MCMC parameter estimation analysis with cos-
momc [44] (see Appendix A for details). We summarize
our constraints on the early-time decaying modiﬁed grav-
ity model of Sec. II in Table I. It is easily noticeable
that the constraining power of the data over the model
changes signiﬁcantly the later we introduce the oscilla-
tions between the Newtonian potentials (z ≤ zon).
For zon = 1000, allowing both signs for fRi ≡ fR(zi =
1000), we infer a 1D-marginalized constraint of |fRi| <
1.3 × 10−2 (95% C.L.), where we adopt a ﬂat symmetric
prior fRi ∈ [−0.1, 0.1]. We stress, however, that positive
values of fRi are aﬀected by the ghost instability dis-
cussed in Sec. II D. Considering the stable branch only
with a negative ﬂat prior, we ﬁnd |fRi| < 1.1 × 10−2.
These values are comparable to the constraints obtained
in Ref. [25] on f (R) models that deviate from the ΛCDM
expansion history, using background data alone. Al-
though we note that these constraints have been inferred
for initial modiﬁcations at much higher redshift. ΛCDM
is clearly the favored model and we ﬁnd no evidence for
early-time modiﬁcations in the observations. The con-
straints we found are mostly driven by two prominent
eﬀects on the CMB that we have observed in Sec. III A 2:
a modiﬁcation of the Sachs-Wolfe plateau and of the am-
plitude of the ﬁrst peak. However, there is also a non-
negligible contribution of CMB lensing, which is sensitive

9

to percent-level modiﬁcations at high (cid:96) [45] and can con-
strain the eﬀects of zon = 1000 shown in Fig. 4. We also
note that the present absolute value of the scalar ﬁeld,
|fR0| ≡ |fR(z = 0)|, is very small and of order 10−8.
This implies that modiﬁcations are strongly suppressed
at the smallest scales, where these are proportional to the
background value of the scalar ﬁeld [20] (see Sec. II B).
Finally, decreasing zon leads to a considerable weaken-
ing of the constraints on the early-time deviation from
GR. With zon = 500, constraints on the scalar ﬁeld value
at equal redshift weaken by a factor of approximately 4.
For zon = 100, we can no longer constrain the scalar ﬁeld
value within the prior |fRi| < 0.1. This is due to the os-
cillations on the slip between the gravitational potentials
being signiﬁcantly damped out by z = 100, hence only
introducing very small deviations from GR.

C. Outlook: 21 cm and Gravitational Waves

Finally, we provide rough estimates of the constraints
on early decaying modiﬁed gravity that will be achiev-
able with 21 cm intensity mapping [46–48] and stan-
dard sirens [29, 49, 50] using gravitational waves emitted
by events at cosmological distances. To estimate con-
straints obtainable with 21 cm surveys, we compare devi-
ations in the matter power spectrum between the model
and ΛCDM to bounds on modiﬁed gravity reported in
Ref. [47] at z = 11 and Ref. [48] at z = 2.5. We ﬁnd
that |fRi| (cid:46) 10−3 and |fRi| (cid:46) 5 × 10−2 for zon = 1000,
which is competitive with the CMB constraints in Ta-
ble I. Standard sirens will constrain the luminosity dis-
tance at z ∼ (1− 2) at the ∼ 1% level, and at the ∼ 10%
level for z ∼ 7 [51, 52]. In modiﬁed gravity models, this
constraint can be used to set a bound on the evolution of
the Planck mass [29], which for our model corresponds to
a constraint of |fRi| (cid:46) 103, which will not be competitive
with the constraints in Table I.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have explored the current cosmologi-
cal constraints that can be inferred on modiﬁcations of
gravity which may become signiﬁcant at early times after
recombination and decay towards the present. We have
chosen the designer hybrid metric-Palatini model as a
speciﬁc example of an early-time modiﬁcation of grav-
ity. Fixing the background evolution to exactly match
ΛCDM, we are able to separate background constraints
from constraints inferred from the modiﬁed dynamics of
linear perturbations due to the impact that these have
on the CMB. We also describe how this model can be
realized in the more general context of the eﬀective ﬁeld
theory formalism of Horndeski gravity, and study its sta-
bility. We conclude that the model is stable as long as
the additional scalar degree of freedom introduced by the
hybrid metric-Palatini theory remains negative with an

amplitude smaller than unity, which implies an eﬀective
enhancement of the gravitational coupling.

In order to perform eﬃcient numerical computations,
we have developed an approximation for the evolution of
the slip between the Newtonian potentials that is valid
beyond the standard quasistatic subhorizon approxima-
tion. This extension becomes important at high redshifts,
where we show that a quasistatic approach alone breaks
down due to the known oscillations of the linear pertur-
bations of the model [26].

Using a combination of observational data on the back-
ground evolution and of the CMB anisotropies, we in-
fer constraints on the allowed early-time deviations from
GR. The results we obtain are dependent on the red-
shift at which we introduce the oscillations in the slip
between the gravitational potentials. If these are set at
zon = 1000, we are able to constrain the absolute devi-
ation from GR at zon to (cid:46) 10−2 at the 95% conﬁdence
level. This result is comparable to the constraints ob-
tained from background data alone in Ref. [25] for f (R)
models that depart from the ΛCDM expansion history.

The constraints we obtain at this redshift can be at-
tributed to noticeable eﬀects on the CMB power spec-
trum. We are able to observe a substantial shift in the
Sachs-Wolfe plateau due to a modiﬁcation of the Newto-
nian potential Φ at a time close to recombination. There
is also a signiﬁcant suppression of the ﬁrst peak due to
complementary variation of the gravitational potentials
close to the epoch of recombination that, together with
the non-negligible presence of radiation, contributes to

10

an early integrated Sachs-Wolfe eﬀect that can alter the
amplitude and position of the peaks. Smaller contribu-
tions to the constraints can be attributed to CMB lensing
which is sensitive to the percent-level modiﬁcations we
observe at high (cid:96). Finally, we ﬁnd that future 21 cm
survey data will signiﬁcantly improve upon the CMB
constraints, whereas using gravitational wave events as
standard sirens will not provide competitive bounds.

Appendix A: Implementation in mgcamb

In order to compute the CMB observables, we imple-
ment our early decaying modiﬁed gravity model in the
publicly available mgcamb code [53], a modiﬁed ver-
sion of the also public camb code [54] that allows to
study the eﬀects of modiﬁed gravity models on the CMB
through modiﬁcations of the linear equations describing

11

the growth of perturbations. mgcamb works by parame-
terizing the evolution of the gravitational potentials sim-
ply through two time- and scale-dependent functions:
the ratio of the metric potentials γ(a, k) ≡ Φ/Ψ and
the eﬀective modiﬁed gravitational coupling in the Pois-
son equation, µ(a, k) = Geﬀ /G. The framework of mg-
camb is general enough to include possible early-time ef-
fects, hence it is well-suited for testing the hybrid metric-
Palatini theory. Moreover, we chose to work with mg-
camb as it allows us to use the approximations described
in Secs. II B 1 and II B 2 to improve computational eﬃ-
ciency without loss of accuracy.

We implement our model by modifying both γ and µ in
the code. For γ we use the subhorizon approximation de-
scribed in Eq. (19) and add an oscillatory term described
by δfR to account for the early-time oscillations. From
Ref. [26] we note that the gravitational potentials can be
expressed as

Φ = Φ+ +

δfR

2(1 + fR)

, Ψ = Φ+ −

δfR

2(1 + fR)

,

(A1)

which uses the observation that the early-time oscil-
lations in δfR do not aﬀect the lensing potential Φ+
for small-enough values of the amplitude of the oscilla-
tions. Φ+ has an approximately constant value of unity
throughout the matter dominated era. Therefore, with
Φ+ (cid:29) δfR one can perform a Taylor expansion on the
ratio between the potentials that results in

γ =

Φ
Ψ

≈ 1 − δfR

(1 + fR)

.

(A2)

We compare this approximation against numerical results
in Fig. 5, ﬁnding good agreement between the two, at an
accuracy comparable to that observed in Fig. 3 for the
slip between the metric potentials. Given this result, we
generalize γQS with the simple modiﬁcation

γMG ≈ γQS +

δfR

1 + fR

,

(A3)

where γQS can be found in Eq. (19). Correspondingly,
we modify µ to include the eﬀect of the oscillations in
the Poisson equation such that

µMG = µQS +

δfR

2(1 + fR)

,

(A4)

where µQS is given in Eq. (16).

Finally, note that the initial conditions required to
solve for the background evolution of our models are
always set at the redshift zi = 1000. As described in
Secs. II C and II D through an embedding in the eﬀective
ﬁeld theory of Horndeski gravity, the model is designed
to behave as ΛCDM at the level of linear perturbations
down to a redshift zon, at which point the modiﬁcations
are introduced. At redshift zi we set δfR = 0, with its
subsequent evolution being determined by Eq. (21).
