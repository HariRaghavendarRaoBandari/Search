Abstract

Combining neutrino mass generation and a dark matter candidate in a uniﬁed model has
always been intriguing. We revisit the class of RνMDM models, which incorporate minimal
dark matter in radiative neutrino mass models based on the one-loop ultraviolet completions of
the Weinberg operator. We also study the phenomenology of one of the models. In addition to
the Standard Model particles, it contains two real scalar quintuplets, one vector-like quadruplet
fermion and a fermionic quintuplet. The neutral component of the fermionic quintuplet serves as
a good dark matter candidate which can be tested by the future direct and indirect detection
experiments. The constraints from ﬂavor physics and electroweak-scale naturalness are also
discussed.

Introduction

The particle identity of dark matter is one of the most important problems in physics beyond the
Standard Model (SM). Generally in dark matter models a discrete symmetry, Z2 symmetry as the
simplest example, has to be imposed by hand or show up as the remnant symmetry of a larger
group to protect the dark matter particle from decaying. Alternatively, the SM gauge group can
be used to stabilize dark matter as discussed in minimal dark matter (MDM) [1] models. Higher
representations of SU(2)L are introduced in MDM models as dark matter candidates. They couple
to the SM sector only through gauge interactions, while other types of interactions such as Yukawa
interactions or scalar interactions are all forbidden by SU(2)L due to their large dimensions. As
a result, an accidental (approximate) Z2 symmetry is present. The symmetry might be exact or
approximately realised if the lifetime is larger than the age of the Universe.

If we consider more than just a single SU(2)L multiplet, we might be able to write down
an interaction between SM fermions or Higgs and a pair of dark sector particles. It is of great
interests to see whether it is possible to simultaneously explain the origin of neutrino masses and
mixings, another clear evidence for physics beyond the SM. There is a rich literature on dark
matter in neutrino mass models (See Refs. [2–5] for example.). The usual seesaw mechanisms [6–
17] obviously can not be incorporated in the framework of MDM, as the intermediate particles
couple to a pair of SM particles and thus are even under the accidental Z2 of MDM. Therefore
we turn our eyes to the next-to-minimal solution, radiative neutrino mass generation [18]. We will
focus on minimal ultraviolet (UV) completions of the Weinberg operator.

This idea of realizing radiative neutrino mass in a minimal dark matter model, coined as
RνMDM, was proposed in Ref. [19], where a scalar sextet and a fermionic quintuplet are introduced.

The neutrino mass would be generated at one-loop level. However, the accidental Z2 symmetry
is broken by a quartic coupling of three scalar multiplets with one Higgs [20] and it can be only
approximately realised in the limit of a small quartic coupling. There are also attempts at higher
loop order (See e.g. Ref. [21]) and based on the generalized Weinberg operator [22]. Now we would
like to take a second look at the one-loop completions of the Weinberg operator and perform a
systematic study and explore the possibility of RνMDM.

This work is organized as follows: In Sec. 2 we discuss the one-loop topologies and determine
the possible RνMDM model realizations. In Sec. 3 we discuss one RνMDM model and obtain an
expression for neutrino mass. The relevant constraints from Higgs and ﬂavor physics are elaborated
on in Sec. 4 and electroweak-scale naturalness in Sec. 5. In Sec. 6 we discuss the allowed parameter
space as well as other phenomenological issues, like collider phenomenology. We conclude in Sec. 7.
Technical details are collected in the appendices.

2 One-Loop RνMDM Models

Majorana neutrino masses can be conveniently expressed in the form of the Weinberg operator

OWeinberg =

LLHH

Λ

,

(1)

where Λ is the suppression scale and L and H denote the lepton and the Higgs doublets in the SM.
The minimal UV completions of the Weinberg operator at tree level are the seesaw mechanisms.
However the Weinberg operator can also be UV completed at loop level and neutrino mass is
generated radiatively. A systematic study of the one-loop UV completions has been performed
in Ref. [23]. Part of the one-loop completions also induce one of the seesaw mechanisms whose
contribution is mostly dominant. These models are thus reducible and not genuine one-loop models.
We show all the topologies that allow irreducible one-loop completions in Fig. 1. The well-known
radiative seesaw model [4] is a realization of T3 shown in Fig. 1d. We want to ﬁrst check the
possibility to accommodate MDM in these topologies. A good RνMDM model should at least
satisfy the following three conditions:

1. At least one of the exotic particles in the loop should be a plausible MDM candidate, which

can be either a fermionic quintuplet or a scalar septuplet with zero hypercharge [1].

Otherwise the quartic term φ†φ(cid:0)φ†H + H†φ(cid:1) will spoil the accidental Z2 symmetry.

2. Any exotic scalar with hypercharge ± 1

2 has to be in an odd-dimensional SU(2) representation.

3. The Lagrangian should of course be invariant under SU(2)L× U(1)Y before electroweak
symmetry breaking. So the existence of the Yukawa interaction Lχiφi for fermions χi and
scalars φi implies

dφi + dχi = 2 n + 1 ,

(2)

where dφi and dχi denote the dimension of φi and χi, and n is a positive integer. Similarly
a scalar trilinear coupling φiφjH will result in

dφi + dφj = 2 n + 1 .

(3)

We discuss the four possible topologies in turn: For topology T1-i, any of the scalar ﬁeld φi
being a dark matter candidate will assign another scalar ﬁeld φj with hypercharge ± 1
2 through
trilinear scalar couplings φiφjH. So according to condition 1 and 2, both φi and φj are odd-
dimensional, which violates condition 3. Alternatively χi can play the role of dark matter. This
will also assign φi with hypercharge ± 1
2 through Yukawa interaction Lχiφi. Similarly both χi and

φi are odd-dimensional according to condition 1 and 2, which contradicts with condition 3. So
topology T1-i does not provide any valid UV completion.

We follow the same argument for topology T1-ii.

It suﬃces to consider either φ1 or χ2 to
be a dark matter candidate as the diagram is symmetric. So the only possible assignment of
hypercharges is Y (φ1) = 0, Y (φ2) = − 1
2 and Y (χ2) = 0. We immediately notice
that φ2 has to be in an odd-dimensional representation according to condition 2. Therefore if
φ1 is the dark matter candidate, it must be an odd-dimensional representation of SU(2)L and
does not satisfy condition 3. Alternatively if χ2 is the dark matter candidate, it should be in an
odd-dimensional representation and does not satisfy condition 3. So topology T1-ii is also ruled
out.

2 , Y (χ1) = 1

For topology T1-iii, we ﬁnd two minimal completions as shown in Tab. 1, one for scalar dark
matter and one for fermion dark matter. Besides the exotic particles shown in the loop, another
fermion ¯ψ has to be introduced to cancel the anomaly and to write down a mass term.

We turn to topology T3 in the end.

If we take χi to be dark matter candidate, φi should

which is contradicting with condition 3. This failed attempt is exactly the model considered in
Ref. [19]. Another possibility is φi being the dark matter candidate. Again we can just take φ1
due to the symmetry of the diagram. The quantum numbers of the exotic particles of the minimal
UV completion of T3 are listed in Tab. 2. Non-minimal completions of T3 contain larger SU(2)
representations.

The last sanity check is to see if any renormalizable term invariant under the SM gauge group
breaks the accidental Z2. For the completions shown in Tab. 1, the Yukawa coupling ψ ¯ψφ spoils
†
Z2 [24] as well as the cubic coupling φ3 [25]. Similarly χ1χ2φ1 and φ1φ
2φ2 for the model in Tab. 2
do the same [24]. Similar arguments apply to higher representations. Hence, there is no one-loop
UV completion of the Weinberg operator in the framework of minimal dark matter, which leads to
an exact accidental Z2 symmetry. However, in the limit of vanishing renormalizable Z2-breaking
couplings, the symmetry of the Lagrangian is enlarged and thus it is technically natural to have
small Z2-breaking couplings [26]. All quantum corrections to these couplings are proportional to
Z2 breaking couplings. With regards to minimal dark matter, the fermionic dark matter candidate
is prefered [1]. We will consider the fermionic dark matter model in Tab. 1 and perform a detailed
phenomenological study under the assumption that the Z2 breaking couplings are suﬃciently small,
such that the lifetime of χ is longer than the age of the Universe and satisﬁes all indirect detection
constraints. Note that besides the three models in Tabs. 1 and 2 there are other one-loop radiative
neutrino mass models with a plausible dark matter candidate.

3 The Model

The RνMDM model we consider in this work contains a real scalar quintuplet φ, two fermionic
quadruplets ψ and ¯ψ, which form a Dirac pair, and a fermionic quintuplet χ. All even-dimensional
SU(2) representations are pseudo-real and all odd ones are real. The higher-dimensional represen-
tations can be easily constructed using raising and lowering operators and we list the ones relevant
for this model in Appendix A.

The real scalar quintuplet φ can be decomposed into electrical charge eigenstates as φ =

(cid:0)φ++, φ+, φ0, φ−, φ−−(cid:1)T , where superscripts denote the electrical charges. The neutral compo-
(cid:0)χ++, χ+, χ0, χ−, χ−−(cid:1)T , ψ =(cid:0)ψ++, ψ+, ψ0, ψ−(cid:1)T and ¯ψ =(cid:0) ¯ψ+, ¯ψ0, ¯ψ−, ¯ψ−−(cid:1)T .

nent ﬁeld φ0 is a real scalar and the charged component ﬁelds (φ+)
form two complex scalars. Similarly for the fermions, the component ﬁelds are deﬁned as χ =

†
= φ−, (φ++)

Besides the SM part, the Lagrangian of this model consists of kinetic terms of the exotic

particles and additional Yukawa interactions

L = LSM + Lkin + Lyuk.

(4)

We leave the details of the kinetic terms to Appendix A as well. From the discussion later in
this section, we know that more than one copy of φ is needed to explain both, the solar and
the atmospheric, mass splittings. Thus we attach a subscript as the family indices φi. Then the

Without loss of generality we can choose Y H to be real and positive using a phase redeﬁnition of
ψ. Similarly three phases of Y L

ij can be absorbed by a phase redeﬁnition of Li.

Apparently the Yukawa interaction in Eqn. (6) will induce mixing in the fermion sector. The

The diagonalization of these mass matrices can be done using the Takagi factorization and singular
value decomposition, respectively. The details of which are collected in Appendix B.

The neutral component of χ is the dark matter candidate of this model. To saturate the dark

matter density observed by Planck [27], the dark matter mass should be[28]

mχ = (9.4 ± 0.47) TeV,

(11)

where Sommerfeld eﬀects have been taken into account [1]. Other dark sector particles have to
be heavier than mχ, which makes the mixing between χ and ψ, roughly given by Y H v/mχ,ψ,
negligible.

and U diagonalises the neutrino mass matrix with ˆmν = V T
To keep minimality, we will only introduce two copies of φ, which suﬃces to explain the solar
and atmospheric mass splittings. One of the neutrinos remains massless. Both Y L and O are 3× 2
matrices. The Yukawa couplings Y L are entirely determined by the solar and atmospheric mass
squared diﬀerences and the leptonic mixing parameters. The only undetermined parameter is a
complex angle parameterising the 3×2 orthogonal matrix O. Neutrino mass ﬁxes the product of the
Yukawa couplings Y L
ij Y H . We will study the phenomenology induced by these Yukawa couplings
and work out the experimental constraints on the model parameter space in the following sections.

4 Constraints from Higgs physics and ﬂavor physics

The Yukawa interactions introduced in Eqn. (5) modify the SM in two aspects: The coupling
between the SM Higgs and the exotic particles will change the decay width of the Higgs; Lepton
family number is also violated and lead to lepton ﬂavor-changing rare processes. Both impose
constraints on the parameter space of the model. Since exotic particles introduced are not charged
under SU (3)c, there will be no new contribution to processes such as meson mixings and b →
s transition. Derivation of the constraints involves calculation of one-loop Feynman diagrams,
which is assisted by the Mathematica packages FeynRules [30], FeynArts [31], FormCalc [32], and
ANT [33]

4.1 Constraints from the Higgs

The Yukawa coupling Y H can modify the behavior of the Higgs boson. As all exotic particles are
colorless, the production of the Higgs at the LHC is untouched. The decay from the Higgs to the
exotic particles is also forbidden kinematically. However, the exotic particles can contribute to
the decay of the Higgs at loop level such as h → γγ or h → Zγ as depicted in Fig. 2. LHC has
measured the production of the Higgs boson in the diphoton channels. Among them the diphoton

measurement is the most accurate one, which we will use to derive our constraint. The Higgs
signal strength in the diphoton channel is deﬁned as

where f (τ ) = sin−1((cid:112)1/τ ) and I(η) has been obtained in the limit mχ, mψ (cid:29) mh. We derive the

limit on Y H for speciﬁc fermion masses from µ = 1.17+0.19−0.17 [34]. In Fig. 3 we plot the contours of
the maximal Y H allowed by the measurements at the LHC in solid lines. As the exotic particles
have masses of 9.4 TeV to saturate the relic density, the current experiments impose literally no
constraints on Y H . We also project the future constraints on Y H at 14 TeV LHC with 3000
f b−1 dataset. An optimistic estimate of 5% sensitivity [35] is used to extract the limits shown
in the dashed contours also in Fig. 3. However, the heavy masses of the exotic particles make it
impossible to place any meaningful constraints on Y H even at the high luminosity (HL) -LHC.

4.2 Lepton Flavor Violating Processes

The Yukawa interaction in Eqn. (7) will induce lepton ﬂavor violating (LFV) processes. Several
LFV processes, such as µ−
extremely high sensitivity, but no signal has been found. The experimental results will surely place
strong constraints on the model parameters. We will study the most well measured and thus most
stringent ones in this section. The implications of these constraints will be discussed in Sec. 6.

In the minimal variant of the model with two scalar quintuplets only, the relative rates are ﬁxed
and they are of similar order of magnitude. The current experimental limits are given by Br(µ →
eγ) < 5.7 × 10−13 [37], Br(τ → eγ) < 3.3 × 10−8 and Br(τ → µγ) < 4.4 × 10−8 [34]. Thus the
most constraining limit is from µ → eγ, which we will discuss in Sec. 6. The proposed upgrade of
MEG will improve the future sensitivity of µ → eγ down to Br(µ → eγ) ∼ 6 × 10−14 [38].

The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon has been measured to a very high precision ∆aµ =
0.0011659209 ± 0.0000000006 [39]. Given the heavy scalar quintuplet masses, the correction to
the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is well below the experimental precision and thus it
does not impose any constraint.
4.2.3 µ → eee

Another well-measured LFV process is µ → eee, which this model will have several diﬀerent
contributions including γ-penguin, Z-penguin, Higgs-penguin, and box diagrams. The contribution
from the Higgs-penguin is proportional to the electron mass and negligible. We show the relevant
Feynman diagrams for this process in Fig. 5. The amplitude of the γ-penguin can be written in

contribution dominates over the contributions of the γ-penguin and the box diagrams. The branch-
ing ratio for this rare decay channel can be approximately obtained by dividing Eqn. (31) by the

4.2.4 µ-e Conversion in Nuclei

The last LFV process we consider is µ-e conversion in nuclei. There are two types of contribu-
tions: the long-range interactions determined by the electromagnetic dipole, and the short-range
interactions from the penguin diagrams as shown in Fig. 5 with the ﬁnal electron pair replaced by
a quark pair. For this model, there is no contribution from the box diagrams because no colored
exotic states are introduced. Therefore the eﬀective Lagrangian can be expressed as

(cid:0)AL
(cid:2)(cid:0)gLV (q)¯eγµPLµ(cid:1) ¯qγµq +(cid:0)gLA(q)¯eγµPLµ(cid:1) ¯qγµγ5q + h.c.(cid:3) ,

ratio between the conversion rate and the capture rate

where the rate ωcapt takes the value 13.07 × 106s−1, 2.59 × 106s−1 and 0.7054 × 106s−1 in Au, Ti
and Al [45]. The current bounds on the branching ratio are Br(µAu → eAu) < 7 × 10−13 and
Br(µTi → eTi) < 4.3× 10−12 [34]. There are good prospects to increase the future sensitivities for
Al and Ti to Br(µAl → eAl) (cid:46) 10−16 [46–50] and Br(µTi → eTi) (cid:46) 10−18 [46; 47], respectively.

In order to estimate the corrections of the new particles on electroweak scale naturalness, we
calculate the corrections to the Higgs bilinear in the scalar potential. The correction to the quartic
term is dimensionless and is not quadratically enhanced by the heavy mass scale compared to the
electroweak scale. We use dimensional regularization with the modiﬁed minimal subtraction (M S)
renormalization scheme to calculate the one-loop correction given in Fig. 6a. After canceling the
divergent part with the counterterm, there is a ﬁnite contribution to the eﬀective bilinear term of
the Higgs µ2

Thus it receives a quadratic correction from the new fermions in the loop. This poses a naturalness
problem. The correction to the quartic coupling is of order (Y H )4, but does not receive a quadratic
enhancement by the large mass hierarchy.

Similarly the Higgs couples to the scalar φ leading to a one-loop correction to the Higgs mass,
which is shown in Fig. 6b. This quartic coupling, however, is unrelated to neutrino mass and could
in principle be arbitrarily small at a given renormalization scale. Thus the two-loop contribution
is eﬀectively the leading order contribution related to φ, that we take into account.

In the unbroken phase its main contribution is given by diagrams of the type shown in Fig. 6c

6 Discussion

Currently the LUX dark matter experiment [51] places the strongest limit on the dark matter
direct detection cross section. The limit on dark matter direct detection cross section is given up
to 1 TeV, which is roughly 10−44 cm2. If we extrapolate the limit to the quintuplet mass, 9.4 TeV,
the limit will be much weaker and thus will not put any constraint on this model at the moment.
This model, however, will be probed by future direct detection experiments such as Xenon 1T [52].
Dark matter annihilation in our galaxy produces high energy gamma rays. Experiments such
as High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S) [53] and the planned Cherenkov Telescope Array
(CTA) [54] are searching for such signals and can place limits on the model. This limit on quintuplet

has been discussed in Refs. [28; 55; 56] thoroughly. It is in tension with the current observation
for a cuspy proﬁle of dark matter halo, but allowed for a cored one. Nevertheless, this model is
within the reach of the future CTA independent of the dark matter proﬁle and will be tested soon.
The possibility to test MDM at a collider has been extensively studied for the LHC, the HL-
LHC and even a 100 TeV proton-proton collider [57; 58]. Generally electroweak multiplets can be
tested in events with mono-jet, mono-photon, vector-boson fusion and disappearing tracks. Among
them, the test with disappearing tracks has the best sensitivity, with a reach of about 3 TeV for
a 100 TeV proton-proton collider for an integrated luminosity of 30 ab−1, which is still far below
the mass of the dark matter candidate of this model.

Lepton ﬂavor violating processes are governed by the Yukawa coupling Y L, while the Higgs to
diphoton branching ratio and naturalness are controlled by Y H . Finally, neutrino mass depends
on the product of Yukawa couplings Y H Y L and thus connects the phenomenology creating an
interesting interplay. The smaller Y H , the larger Y L and consequently the larger the LFV branch-
ing ratios. In Fig. 7 we show the branching ratio for the lepton ﬂavor violating processes µ → eγ
(red) , µ → eee (green), and µ-e conversion1 in gold (blue), aluminium (maroon), and titanium
(magenta) as a function of Y H for ﬁxed masses mχ = 9.4 TeV, mψ = 15 TeV, mφ1 = 16 TeV, and
mφ2 = 16.5 TeV as solid lines. The dotted lines indicate the change if the masses of ψ and φi are

1We use the values of Tab. 1 of Ref. [45] for the overlap integrals. A comparison of the rates for the overlap
integral values in Tabs. 2 and 4 of [45] indicates an uncertainty of about 44%, 5%, and 11% for Au, Al, and Ti,
respectively.

are ﬁxed to the best-ﬁt values of v2.0 of the nu-ﬁt collaboration [59]. Leptonic CP phases are set to

experimental bounds on Br(µ → eγ) < 5.7 × 10−13 [37] (red), Br(µ → eee) < 10−12 [43] (green),
Br(µTi → eTi) < 4× 10−13 [60] (magenta), and Br(µAu → eAu) < 7× 10−13 [61] (blue), while the
dashed lines indicate the future sensitivities: Br(µ → eγ) ∼ 6 × 10−14 [38], Br(µ → eee) ∼ 10−16
[44], Br(µAl → eAl) ∼ 10−16 [46–50]) and Br(µTi → eTi) ∼ 10−18 [46; 47] For ﬁxed masses and
Yukawa coupling Y H , it is possible to quantify how much the parameters of the model have to
be tuned to obtain the electroweak scale. We show the required ﬁne-tuning ∆−1, which is deﬁned
in Eqn. (42), as a black solid line for our benchmark point and dotted line for doubled particle
masses. The values can be read oﬀ the y-axis on the right-hand side. The Yukawa coupling Y H be-
comes non-perturbative on the right-hand side of the ﬁgure, while the largest entry of the Yukawa
coupling Y L becomes non-perturbative on the left-hand side of the ﬁgure. We plot the maximum
value of the Yukawa couplings in gray. The value can be read oﬀ the y-axis on the right-hand side.
Fig. 8 illustrates the uncertainty in the solar and atmospheric mass squared diﬀerences and
leptonic mixing parameters. All these parameters are varied within their 3σ allowed ranges. The
diﬀerent colors and line styles are chosen in the same way as in Fig. 7. Fixing everything but
the leptonic mixing parameters and mass squared diﬀerences, there is an uncertainty of up to
three orders of magnitude in the rates for the diﬀerent processes. Fig. 9 shows a contour plot
of Br(µAu → eAu) in the plane of the imaginary part of the complex angle θ in the complex
orthogonal matrix O and the Yukawa coupling Y H . All LFV rates are relatively insensitive to the
real part of θ and change at most at the percent level. A large imaginary part however leads to
large Yukawa couplings Y L canceling among each other to accommodate the light neutrino mass.
Finally we want to comment on the renormalization group evolution of the couplings in this
model. The large SU(2) representations lead to a strong running of the gauge couplings resulting
in a Landau pole at a scale of about 109 GeV, where we have taken two-loop running into account.
Similarly the quartic couplings of large scalar SU(2) representations suﬀer from the triviality
bound [62–64], because gauge couplings will induce these couplings at one-loop order, which will
be further ampliﬁed by the running of the respective quartic coupling itself [64]. In particular, the
study in Ref. [64] ﬁnds that the quartic coupling of the real quintuplet suﬀers from a Landau pole
below 1015 GeV. A viable UV completion has to preserve the accidental Z2 symmetry to prevent
the minimal dark matter candidate from decaying. We are agnostic about the UV completion and
mainly concentrate on phenomenology, since there are good prospects to ultimately test minimal
dark matter models in the near future. See Ref. [24] for an upcoming study of UV completions.

7 Conclusion

Embedding radiative neutrino mass models in the framework of MDM to make one theory work for
two major ﬁelds of physics beyond the SM is aesthetically appealing. We systematically studied
the possibility to realize this idea with radiative neutrino mass models as UV completions of the
Weinberg operator. None of the minimal UV completions at one-loop leads to a stable minimal
dark matter candidate. However we argued that it is feasible to obtain a cosmologically stable
dark matter candidate, because the decay is controlled by a coupling unrelated to neutrino mass
generation, which can naturally be arbitrarily small.

We studied the phenomenology of one model explicitly. The model contains two real quintuplet
scalars and also a quintuplet fermion whose neutral component ﬁeld plays the role of dark matter.
Both ﬁelds have zero hypercharge. In addition, a vector-like quadruplet fermion are introduced
with hypercharge ± 1
2 . We discussed the neutrino mass generation in this model and performed a
detailed phenomenological study of lepton ﬂavour violation and Higgs decay. There is a sizable
allowed region of parameter space consistent with all current experimental constraints from Higgs

physics and lepton ﬂavor changing processes. The most stringent bound is placed by µ-e conversion
in nuclei and will be further improved by future experiments. It places a lower bound on the Yukawa
coupling Y H and thus increases the electroweak ﬁne-tuning. Current bounds already require at
least ∼ 10% tuning. In the near future, the remaining parameter space of this model can be tested
by direct detection experiments like XENON 1T and indirect detection experiments such as CTA.

The mass mixing in this model is proportional to Y H v/mψ,χ and thus very suppressed for heavy
masses of O(10) TeV. Although it can be safely neglected in most of the calculation as we did, we
