MEASURING TYPE IA SUPERNOVA POPULATIONS OF STRETCH AND COLOR AND PREDICTING

DISTANCE BIASES

D. Scolnic1& R. Kessler1

March 7, 2016

ABSTRACT

Simulations of Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia) surveys are a critical tool for correcting biases in the
analysis of SN Ia to infer cosmological parameters. Large scale Monte Carlo simulations include a
thorough treatment of observation history, measurement noise, intrinsic scatter models and selection
eﬀects. In this paper, we improve simulations with a robust technique to evaluate the underlying pop-
ulations of SN Ia color and stretch that correlate with luminosity. In typical analyses, the standardized
SNIa brightness is determined from linear ‘Tripp’ relations between the light curve color and lumi-
nosity and between stretch and luminosity. However, this solution produces Hubble residual biases
because intrinsic scatter and measurement noise result in measured color and stretch values that do
not follow the Tripp relation. We ﬁnd a 10σ bias (up to 0.3 mag) in Hubble residuals versus color and
5σ bias (up to 0.2 mag) in Hubble residuals versus stretch in a joint sample of 920 spectroscopically
conﬁrmed SN Ia from PS1, SNLS, SDSS and several low-z surveys. After we determine the underlying
color and stretch distributions, we use simulations to predict and correct the biases in the data. We
show that removing these biases has a small impact on the low-z sample, but reduces the intrinsic
scatter σint from 0.101 to 0.083 in the combined PS1, SNLS and SDSS sample. Past estimates of the
underlying populations were too broad, leading to a small bias in the equation-of-state of dark energy
w of ∆w = 0.005.

1.

INTRODUCTION

The standardization of measurements of Type Ia Su-
pernovae led to the discovery that the universe is expand-
ing at an increasing rate (Riess et al. 1998, Perlmutter
et al. 1999). The cause of this acceleration, dubbed ‘dark
energy’, is one of the great mysteries in cosmology today.
Because SN Ia remain one of the premier tools to measure
dark energy properties, great eﬀort has gone into acquir-
ing increasingly large samples and reﬁning methods of
standardization.

Conventionally, the diversity of SN Ia light curves is de-
scribed by three parameters: an amplitude, a color and a
light curve width. The Tripp estimator (Tripp 1998) uses
these three parameters to standardize the SN Ia bright-
ness and determine the distance. Within the formalism
of the light curve model SALT2 (Guy et al. 2010), the
distance for each SN Ia is expressed as
µ = mb + αx1 − βc − M

(1)

where µ is the distance modulus, mb is the log of the
overall amplitude needed to scale the model to match
the data, x1 describes the stretch of the light curve, c is
a color parameter that is roughly B − V at peak, and M
is the ﬁducial SN Ia magnitude. α and β are global nui-
sance parameters that quantify the correlation between
luminosity with stretch and color, respectively.

The Tripp estimator does not capture all of the bright-
ness variation of SN Ia, and recent simulation studies
(Kessler et al. 2013 (K13), Mosher et al. 2014, Scolnic
et al. 2014b (S14a), Scolnic et al. 2014a (S14b)) have
shown there are small biases in the measurements of α
and β. The fundamental issue with the Tripp estima-

tor is that it does not separate the amount of color or
stretch that correlates with luminosity, here referred to as
the underlying color or stretch population, from intrin-
sic scatter of the SN brightness or measurement noise.
The intrinsic scatter is the magnitude of the dispersion
of distance residuals to a best ﬁt cosmology if light curves
were observed with no measurement noise. This scatter
can be caused by either chromatic or achromatic vari-
ation of the spectral model. Near the magnitude limit
of a survey, intrinsic scatter and measurement noise re-
sult in preferentially selecting events that are brighter
than the standardized brightness based on the measured
color and stretch. This selection bias results in a µ bias
that increases with redshift, and if not corrected, results
in a signiﬁcant bias in the inferred cosmological param-
eters. Additional bias occurs when ﬂuctuations result
in unphysical color and stretch values that do not cor-
relate with luminosity, but are still assumed to follow
Eq. 1. For example, a ‘true’ SN color of c = 0 may
be observed at c = −0.2 due to intrinsic scatter and/or
measurement noise and there will then be a distance bias
of −β × (cObs − cTrue) ∼ 0.6 mag as β ∼ 3. In princi-
ple, full Bayesian analyses (e.g. Mandel et al. 2011) can
be used to resolve this issue. However, more analyti-
cal approaches are limited by the complex nature of SN
surveys; selection eﬀects must be separated from the SN
physics.

The analysis discussed in this paper uses a large sample
of 920 spectroscopically conﬁrmed SN Ia; data is com-
bined from CfA1-4 (Riess et al. 1999, Jha et al. 2006,
Hicken et al. 2009, Hicken et al. 2012), CSP (Stritzinger
et al. 2011), PS1 (Rest et al. 2014), SDSS (Sako et al.
2014) and SNLS (Guy et al. 2010). An overview of the
calibration of these samples is presented in Scolnic et al.
(2015). Previous analyses (K13, S14a, Betoule et al. 2014
(B14)) have determined biases from Eq. 1, but the un-

2

derlying color and stretch distributions were not rigor-
ously determined. These studies all used simulations of
SN surveys generated by the SNANA software package
(Kessler et al. 2009). These simulations have been exten-
sively tested where they show excellent agreement with
the data in several key distributions. The simulations in-
clude models of the intrinsic scatter, measurement noise
and selection eﬀects.

In section 2, we describe the formalism to determine
the underlying color and stretch distributions. In section
3, we predict the biases in Hubble residuals and correct
for them.
In section 4, we present our discussion and
conclusions.

2. DETERMINING THE UNDERLYING COLOR AND

STRETCH POPULATIONS

We follow the formalism presented in K13 in which an
underlying parameter population, y, is parameterized by
an asymmetric gaussian such that

(cid:26) e[−(y−¯y)2/2σ2−]

e[−(y−¯y)2/2σ2
+]

P (y) =

if y < ¯y;
if y > ¯y,

(2)

where ¯y is the value with maximum probability and σ−
and σ+ are the low and high sided gaussian widths. This
parameterization is chosen to account for the observed
asymmetric distributions that have more events for dim-
mer SNe which are redder and have smaller stretch. To
determine the 3 color and 3 stretch parameters in Eq. 2,
we ﬁnd the set of parameters for which the simulation
best matches the data. While this matching could be
done by simulating many samples over a grid of param-
eters, we have instead developed a much faster ﬁtting
method that requires just a single simulated sample.

To measure the underlying populations, we simulate
a ﬂat distribution of both color and stretch, and mea-
sure the migration of input values to observed values.
The measurement noise and intrinsic scatter smear the
input distributions, and selection eﬀects skew the ob-
served distribution towards brighter SNe with bluer col-
ors and higher-stretch values. We deﬁne a migration ma-
trix where each component Cij is the ratio of simulated
SNe with a ﬁtted color ci divided by the number of sim-
ulated SNe with a true input color cj. A similar mi-
gration matrix with Xij describes the stretch parameter.
Without measurement noise, intrinsic scatter or selec-
tion eﬀects, these matrices are purely diagonal. Adding
measurement noise and intrinsic scatter, the matrix has
non-zero oﬀ-diagonal elements. Adding selection eﬀects,
the migration matrices are skewed towards bluer colors
and higher stretch values. In this analysis, we analyze
the color and stretch populations independently. This is
likely not fully adequate if there are correlations between
the distributions of the color and stretch (Sullivan et al.
2010). However, initial tests show that the covariant
term is small compared to the widths of the individual c
and x1 populations.

To solve for the underlying color population, P (c), we
ﬁrst deﬁne a binned distribution (cid:126)Pc where Pci is the prob-
ability that SNe have a color in bin i. We then write:

where the binned vector sc represents the simulated dis-
tribution of ﬁtted color with the same binning as the
migration matrix C and the population vector (cid:126)Pc. A
similar equation is used for the underlying stretch dis-
tribution with eﬃciency matrix X, population vector (cid:126)Px
and simulated vector (cid:126)sx.

We do not modify any part of the simulations used for
the cosmology analyses besides the underlying parame-
ter populations. The choice of using the spectroscopic
selection functions already determined for each survey is
slightly circular because each survey selection function
was determined after assuming an approximate underly-
ing color and stretch population. However, the choice of
underlying population has little impact on the measured
selection function. Similarly, the input cosmological pa-
rameters in the simulation, varied within their uncertain-
ties, have negligible eﬀect on the recovered populations.
We limit this analysis to two models of intrinsic scat-
ter with diﬀerent amounts of chromatic and achromatic
spectral variation: 1) the model presented in Guy et al.
(2010) (hereafter called the G10 scatter model) in which
70% of the contribution to the Hubble residuals comes
from achromatic variation and 30% comes from chro-
matic variation and 2) the model presented in Chotard
et al. (2011) (hereafter called the C11 scatter model),
in which 25% of the contribution to the Hubble resid-
uals comes from achromatic variation and 75% comes
from chromatic variation. Since the G10 and C11 scat-
ter models were originally created as broadband varia-
tions models, K13 converted each of these models into
a spectral-variation model that is added to the SALT2
spectral model in our simulations. To solve for (cid:126)Pc, we
minimize the expression

∆χ2 =

( (cid:126)oc − (cid:126)sc)2/ (cid:126)ec

2

(4)

(cid:88)

n=1

√

where (cid:126)oc is the observed binned vector of colors and (cid:126)sc is
the simulated binned vector of colors (from Eq. 3). The
(cid:126)oc when (cid:126)oc (cid:54)= 0 and (cid:126)ec = 1.0
error vector (cid:126)ec is set to be
when (cid:126)oc = 0. A similar expression can be written for the
population of x1. Setting (cid:126)ec = 1.0 for empty bins is not
technically correct given a purely Poissonian distribution
(Baker & Cousins 1984), however, the distribution is not
exactly Poissonian and our approximation limits the bias
from empty bins. Finally, this method can be applied to
individual surveys and for individual redshift bins. In our
analysis, we determine a solution for each survey. While
we don’t explicitly solve for redshift-dependent popula-
tion parameters, the diﬀerent redshift range for each sur-
vey provides some information about the redshift depen-
dence. The median redshifts for the low-z, SDSS, PS1
and SNLS samples are z = 0.03, 0.20, 0.29, 0.64 respec-
tively.

We present our results for underlying color and stretch
populations in Table 1 and Fig. 1. We ﬁnd reasonable
consistency in the populations among the SDSS, SNLS
and PS1 samples, while the low-z population is somewhat
diﬀerent. The diﬀerent low-z population is expected be-
cause low-z surveys typically targeted bright galaxies and
thus favored galaxies that host fainter SNe with redder
colors and lower stretch values (Sullivan et al. 2010). We
also ﬁnd that the diﬀerent amounts of chromatic spectral
variation have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the measured un-

(Fig. 1), yet these bins are populated in the measured
distributions (Fig. 2). Therefore, treating these unphys-
ical color and stretch values with Eq. 1 results in biased
distances.

Here we compare our ﬁndings for the underlying pop-
ulations with previous analyses. The populations we
ﬁnd are signiﬁcantly more skewed and narrow than those
used in JLA (B14). The JLA analysis overestimates the
width of the underlying stretch and color populations for
each subsample. For example, for the SDSS population,
JLA uses (¯c, σ−,σ+) of (0.0,0.08,0.13) whereas we ﬁnd
(−0.038,0.048,0.079). Furthermore, JLA assumed the
same underlying population for both the G10 and C11
scatter models, whereas we ﬁnd that the color population
clearly depends on the scatter model chosen. The PS1
cosmology analysis (S14b) estimated the population pa-
rameters for both scatter models. The parameters found
for the G10 scatter model are in good agreement with
those found here, but those found for the low-z sample
with the C11 scatter model have a signiﬁcant mean color
oﬀset ∆c = 0.035 compared to that found here.

We also compare our measurements of β with previous
analyses. The value of β found with the G10 model is
similar to many past analyses (e.g. B14). The value
of β found with the C11 model agrees with that found
in Chotard et al. (2011) as well as a recent analysis that
examines supernova spectral twins (Fakhouri et al. 2015).

derlying color population, but very little impact on the
measured underlying stretch population. For the C11
model with a large amount of color scatter, the under-
lying population resembles an exponential decay. This
distribution is consistent with extinction by dust being
the primary component of the color-luminosity correla-
tion. Most of the underlying distributions show steep
drops, particularly at the high-stretch end and the blue-
color end.

In Fig. 2, we show that when we resimulate our sam-
ples with our determined populations, we accurately re-
produce the observed distributions. We see slight evi-
dence of bimodality in the x1 distribution of the low-z
sample (with a second peak around x1 = −2) that is not
captured by our model, though it is unclear if this is a
statistical ﬂuctuation. Comparing Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 il-
lustrates a signiﬁcant part of the µ bias. The underlying
population drops to zero around c ∼ −0.15 or x1 ∼ 1.5

3. CORRECTING HUBBLE BIASES

Since both the color and stretch populations have a
sharp roll oﬀ at the bright end, statistical ﬂuctuations
can result in measured c and x1 values beyond the phys-
ical range, and these unphysical values do not correlate
with luminosity. We therefore expect Hubble residual
biases at the extreme color and stretch values, and here
we predict these biases using simulations that include
the underlying populations. We show trends in Hubble
residuals with color and stretch in Fig. 3 for both data
and simulations. Here again, we perform a separate sim-
ulation for the G10 and C11 intrinsic scatter model. We
ﬁnd that both simulations reproduce the signiﬁcant bi-
ases seen in the data near bluer colors and higher stretch
values. These trends are signiﬁcant at the 10σ level for
c and 5σ for x1 in the data.

In previous analyses like JLA or PS1, Hubble residual
biases were corrected only as a function of redshift. Here
we ﬁnd that bias corrections also depend on c and x1. To
illustrate the improvement with a more proper treatment
of bias corrections, we measure the distance bias in bins
of ∆z = 0.015 ∗ (1 + 2 × z), ∆c = 0.05 and ∆x1 = 0.50
from simulations and apply these corrections to the data.
These corrections remove the trends seen in Fig. 3. The
correction for the distance biases presented here is more
accurate than a simplistic bi-linear ﬁt of Hubble residuals
for c > 0 and c < 0, as done in S14a and Rubin et al.
(2015), because of the non-linearity of the trend and its
dependance on redshift.

We ﬁnd the improvement from our 3-dimensional bias
correction comes almost entirely from the z > 0.1 sample
of PS1, SDSS and SNLS SNe. A separate σint is added to
the distance errors of the low-z and high-z sample such
that χ2/NDOF = 1 for the Hubble diagram ﬁt. In total,
the χ2 for our sample of 920 SNe is reduced from 920,
using a correction solely based on z, to 810 using the
3-dimensional corrections from simulations with the G10
model and to 821 using our simulations with the C11
model. For z < 0.1, σint is reduced from σint = 0.130 to
σint = 0.128 after applying the correction with the G10
model. However, for z > 0.1, σint is reduced from 0.101
to 0.083. These results are very similar to that seen in
our simulations. For the low-z simulated sample, the dif-
ference in σint is marginal (∼ 0.002) but for the high-z
simulated sample, σint = 0.102 before the correction and
σint = 0.084 after the correction. The diﬀerence between
the impact of the correction at high and low-z can be
explained by the diﬀerences in width of the underlying
distributions shown in Table 1. Given narrower underly-
ing populations for the higher-z samples, combined with
larger statistical uncertainties, a larger fraction of the ﬁt-
ted c and x1 values lie outside the physical region and
therefore the correction has a larger impact compared to
the low-z sample.

We show in Fig. 4 that σint still has a strong depen-
dance on the color of the SNe even after the distance
biases have been removed. To better probe this trend,
only z > 0.1 SNe (SDSS+SNLS+PS1) and bins with
> 10 events are shown. The simulated predictions of σint
versus color show marginal agreement with the data in
Fig. 4, although the C11 model has better agreement for
redder SNe. Neither model predicts the small σint = 0.0
at c ∼ −0.12 (bin with 85 SNe). We only show bins with

> 10 SNe.2

Our results are based on simulations with a ﬁxed input
value of β, and thus we try to predict the σint variation in
Fig. 4 by varying the simulated β using a Gaussian distri-
bution with σβ = 1 over a range of 1 < β < 5. However,
this β variation does not reproduce the sharpness of the
eﬀect from blue to red colors seen in the data. The min-
imum of σint in the top panel of Fig. 4 is around where
the amount of dust extinction is negligible (c ∼ −0.1), so
the distances for SNe in this color range are less sensitive
to issues with β.
For comparison, our distance correction reduces the χ2
of the sample 5× more than the distance correction for
the step between Hubble residual and mass (e.g. Sullivan
et al. 2010, Kelly et al. 2010, Lampeitl et al. 2010). How-
ever, our distance bias correction has only a very small
eﬀect on the ‘step’ in Hubble residuals for SNe with host
galaxy mass > 1010 Msolar and < 1010 Msolar, which we
ﬁnd to be 0.060 ± 0.009 mag before our bias correction
and 0.050 ± 0.009 mag after our bias correction.

Finally, we evaluate the impact of our improved Hubble
bias corrections on cosmological constraints from com-
bining our SN sample with CMB measurements from
Planck Collaboration et al. (2014). These constraints
are roughly the same using a 3-dimensional Hubble bias
correction over z, x1 and c values versus the conven-
tional 1-dimensional correction over z values. However,
there is a reduction of 0.003 in the w-uncertainty (from
werr ∼ 0.05) when using the 3-dimensional correction
because of the reduced dispersion. We also compare the
value of w recovered when correcting the distances using
our populations determined in this analysis versus the
populations used in the previous analyses. We measure
a small bias of ∆w = +0.005 for the full sample using the
JLA population parameters. We measure a larger bias
of ∆w = +0.025 for the sample used in the PS1 analysis,
which only included PS1 and a low-z sample, mainly due
to the diﬀerence in color population parameters we ﬁnd
for the low-z sample in this analysis compared to S14b.
Bias corrections using inaccurate populations result in a

We have begun to explore additional complexity in our
simulations, such as the possible variation in β. This
variation has already been discussed in previous analyses
(e.g. Foley & Kasen 2011, Mandel et al. 2011, Burns et al.
2014), and should be further explored. It is particularly
interesting that given a large amount of color variation
(the C11 scatter model), the underlying color population
that we recover resembles a dust model with a sharp cut
at the blue color end and an exponential tail at the red
color end. This interpretation shows that the community
data sample has adequate statistics to probe SN physics,
provided that detailed simulations of each sample can be
generated.

One limitation of our analysis is that we measure the
underlying population for only two diﬀerent models of
the intrinsic scatter. The similarity in the predicted dis-
tance biases using the two diﬀerent scatter models in Fig.
3 shows that the systematic uncertainty on w from the
choice of intrinsic scatter model is small. However, the
mismatch between data and simulations shown in Fig. 4
could be a hint of additional unknown biases, so improv-
ing the intrinsic scatter model is important for ruling out
unknown biases as well as further reducing the Hubble
residuals.

In conclusion, this paper presents a robust determi-
nation of the underlying populations of the color and
stretch populations of SN Ia. These populations are used
in simulations to predict and correct for Hubble resid-
ual biases, and are essential to infer precise cosmological
parameters.

SNIa samples.

4. DISCUSSION

This paper probes the importance of using simulations
to measure the underlying SNIa stretch and color distri-
butions, and shows that a better understanding reduces
distance biases and dispersion. Here, we independently
determine the underlying c and x1 distributions, and af-
terwards, determine the correlation coeﬃcients (α and
β) with luminosity.
In principle, this analysis can be
generalized to simultaneously determine the population
parameters, α and β, and the cosmological parameters.
For now, we have veriﬁed that the populations found here
have little dependance on the assumed cosmology in our
simulations.
