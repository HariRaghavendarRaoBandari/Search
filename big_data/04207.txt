Phase speed and frequency-dependent damping of
longitudinal intensity oscillations in coronal loop
structures observed with AIA/SDO

A.Abedini1

intensity oscillations along
Abstract Longitudinal
coronal
loops that are interpreted as signatures of
magneto-acoustic waves are observed frequently in dif-
ferent coronal structures. The aim of this paper is to
estimate the physical parameters of the slow waves and
the quantitative dependence of these parameters on
their frequencies in the solar corona loops that are sit-
uated above active regions with the Atmospheric Imag-
ing Assembly (AIA) onboard Solar Dynamic Observa-
tory (SDO). The observed data on 2012-Feb-12, consist-
ing of 300 images with an interval of 24 seconds in the
171 ˚A and 193 ˚A passbands is analyzed for evidence of
propagating features as slow waves along the loop struc-
tures. Signatures of longitudinal intensity oscillations
that are damped rapidly as they travel along the loop
structures were found, with periods in the range of a
few minutes to few tens of minutes. Also, the projected
(apparent) phase speeds, projected damping lengths,
damping times and damping qualities of ﬁltered inten-
sities centred on the dominant frequencies are measured
in the range of Cs ≃ 38 − 79 km s−1, Ld ≃ 23 − 68 Mm,
τd ≃ 7 − 21 min and τd/P ≃ 0.34 − 0.77, respec-
tively. The theoretical and observational results of this
study indicate that the damping times and damping
lengths increase with increasing the oscillation periods,
and are highly sensitive function of oscillation period,
but the projected speeds and the damping qualities are
not very sensitive to the oscillation periods. Further-
more, the magnitude values of physical parameters are
in good agreement with the prediction of the theoret-
ical dispersion relations of high-frequency MHD waves
(> 1.1 mHz) in a coronal plasma with electron number
density in the range of ne ≃ 107 − 1012 cm−3.

1 Introduction

The observational results of satellites such as Yohkoh,
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO), Transition
Region And Coronal Explorer (TRACE), Hinode, So-
lar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) and
SDO indicate that there are now clear examples of
low-amplitude quasi-periodic intensity oscillations with
long-oscillation periods in diﬀerent coronal structures
(see, e.g., Ofman et al.
1997, 1999; DeForest and
Gurman 1998; Berghmans et al. 1999; De Moortel et
al. 2000, 2009; Mariska 2006; McEwan and De Moor-
tel 2006; Wang et al.
2009; Mariska and Muglach
2010). These low-amplitude intensity oscillations may
be caused by propagating or standing slow magneto-
acoustic waves. Propagating intensity oscillations in
coronal holes high above the limb were ﬁrst observed by
Ofman et al. (1997). Deforest and Gurman (1998) ob-
served similar propagating intensity oscillations (com-
pressive waves trains) in the plumes. Ofman et al.
(1999) suggested that these propagating oscillations
may be caused by magneto-acoustic wave due to their
propagating speeds that are close to the sound speed
in the corona. Also, intensity oscillations with large
Doppler-shift velocities and strong oscillatory damping
detected in hot coronal loops. These oscillations were
interpreted as signatures of longitudinal slow magneto-
acoustic mode excited impulsively in the corona loops.
They had periods from about 7 to 31 minutes and de-
cay times in the range of 6-37 minutes (see, e.g., Ofman
and Wang 2002; Kliem et al. 2002; Sakurai et al. 2002;
Wang et al. 2002a, 2002c, 2003a, 2003b, 2011; Baner-
jee et al. 2007; Erd´elyi et al. 2008). There have been

2

many theoretical studies examining the standing and
propagating longitudinal slow magneto-acoustic waves
in coronal loop structures. Theoretical studies investi-
gating the damping of the slow waves have concentrated
on the eﬀects of thermal conduction, compressive vis-
cosity, optically thin radiation, gravitational stratiﬁca-
tion and magnetic ﬁeld divergence. In general, thermal
conduction is found to be the dominant mechanism for
dissipation of slow waves in the corona (see, e.g., Porter
et al. 1994; Roberts 2000, 2006; Nakariakov et al. 2000,
2005; Tsiklauri and Nakariakov, 2001; Ofman et al.
2000; De Moortel and Hood 2003, 2004a; Mendoza-
Brice˜no et al. 2004; Klimchuk et al. 2004; Verwichte
et al. 2005, 2008; Van Doorsselaere et al. 2011; Abe-
dini and Safari, 2011; Abedini et al. 2012). The idea
of coronal seismology was ﬁrst suggested by Uchida
(1968, 1970). Then, this idea has been both widely
and successfully employed to determine coronal prop-
erties and MHD waves. For example, Marsh and Walsh
(2009) presented the three-dimensional observations of
coronal slow magneto-acoustic wave propagation. The
magnitude of 132 ± 9 and 132 ±11 km s−1 was found for
coronal longitudinal slow mode speed with STEREO A
and STEREO B observation. Marsh et al. (2011) deter-
mined the density proﬁle of the loop system using Hin-
ode observations and measured the three-dimensional
amplitude decay length of the slow wave. The mag-
nitude of the three-dimensional decay length of slow
wave was found 20 and 27 Mm for STEREO A and
STEREO B observation, respectively. Van Doorsse-
laere et al. (2011) used observations of a slow MHD
wave in the corona to determine for the ﬁrst time the
value of the eﬀective adiabatic index by the Extreme-
ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hin-
ode. The magnitude of the eﬀective adiabatic index for
slow wave was measured 1.01 ± 0.02 and found that the
thermal conduction is dominant mechanism for dissi-
pation of slow waves in the corona. Yuan and Nakari-
akov (2012) analyzed the quasi-periodic Extreme Ultra-
Violet (EUV) disturbances propagating at a coronal
fan-structure of active region by AIA/SDO in 171 ˚A.
They designed cross-ﬁtting technique, 2D coupled ﬁt-
ting and best similarity match to measure the apparent
phase speed of propagating disturbances in the running
diﬀerences of time-distance plots (R) and background-
removed and normalised time-distance plots (D). In this
analysis, the average apparent phase speed was mea-
sured at 47.6 km s−1 and 49.0 km s−1 for R and D, with
the corresponding oscillation periods at 179.7±0.2 s and
179.7 ± 0.3, respectively. Threlfall et al.(2013) stud-
ied both transverse and longitudinal motion by com-
paring and contrasting time-distance images of parallel
and perpendicular cuts along/across active region fan

loops. The apparent phase speed of transverse and lon-
gitudinal oscillations are found 600 − 750 km s−1(P =
3 − 8 min) and 100 − 200 km s−1(P = 6 − 11 min) along
loop structures and above the limb, respectively. More-
over, the propagation speeds of waves in the sunspots,
non-sunspots, loop structures and polar regions were
studied by many authors (see, e.g., Kiddie et al. 2012;
Uritsky et al.
2013). Recently, Krishna Prasad et
al. (2014) studied both theoretically and observation-
ally the quantitative dependence of projected damping
length of the magneto-acoustic wave on its frequency.
They found that damping length on loop structures
over a sunspot and an on-disk plume like structure
increases with oscillation period. The plume and in-
terplume structures at the south pole damping length
decrease with oscillation period. Although damping
of slow waves has been studied extensively in diﬀer-
ent coronal structures, but, studies on the periodicity
dependence of their damping are relatively limited. In
this paper, a new method is applied to investigate the
nature of longitudinal intensity ﬂuctuation in active-
region coronal loop structures observed with AIA/SDO.
The averages and ranges of both the apparent and real
physical parameters of longitudinal intensity ﬂuctua-
tion for six diﬀerent paths along the corona loops such
as projected damping length, projected phase speed,
oscillation periods, damping time and damping quality
has been extracted in 171˚A and 193˚A passbands. More-
over, both theoretically and observationally the quanti-
tative dependence of damping of the intensity ﬂuctua-
tion on its frequency is studied. The paper is organized
as follows. Section 2 describes the observations. Section
3 describes method of data analysis. Section 4 describes
the method of the physical parameters calculation. Sec-
tion 5 presents the theoretical considerations. Finally,
discussion and conclusions are given in section 6.

2 Observations

The observations of interest for this study are based
upon AIA/SDO data. The AIA data consist of high
cadence (12 s) images of the solar corona in 10 UV and
EUV wavelengths. The images must be cleaned and
calibrated using a number of reduction procedures be-
fore the data can be analyzed. The data used here is at
level of 1.5. On the other hand, ﬂat-ﬁelding, co-aligned,
ﬁlter, vignette, and bad pixel/cosmic-ray corrections
have already been applied on the data. Furthermore,
the images have been rescaled to a standard 0.6” plate
scale, and have been rotated so that solar north is up
in the image.
In order to obtain the physical prop-
erties of longitudinal intensity ﬂuctuation in the large

3

active -region loops, we need an active region loop sys-
tem which supports slow-mode wave propagation. The
data under analysis here is taken on 12 February 2012,
from 18:30 UT until 20:30 UT and it consists of a se-
ries of 800 × 460 pixel, Sun-centered, subﬁeld images on
the 171˚A (Fe IX) and 193˚A (Fe XIV) passbands with
a time-distance 24 s. All of coronal loop structures ob-
served are situated above an interesting active region;
this region is numbered AR11416 (12 February 2012).
Figure 1 shows an image of AR 11416 at 18:30 UT on
which we are concentrating in this paper. The six dif-
ferent loop segments in Fig. 1 show the paths we will be
looking at in detail for analysis. In order to obtain the
intensity as function of distance along loop segments,
these paths also are subdivided by macropixels with
3×3 pixels wide along the loop segments. A zoomed
in view of a partial segment on loop 1 is shown in the
bottom left corner of the Fig. 1.

3 Data Analysis

In order to investigate the oscillatory nature of the in-
tensity propagations along the coronal loop system, the
marked regions along the path of the loops are joined by
successive macropixels, 3×3 pixels wide along the loop
strands. The intensity of each macropixel along the
loop system is integrated and divided into the number
of pixels at each macropixel. A quasi-static background
must be removed from original intensity for enhancing
the contrast of intensity variation. Following Yuan and
Nakariakov (2012), a background intensity of the form

Ib(s, tn) =

+N/2−1

X

h=−N/2

I(s, tn+h)/N,

(1)

is subtracted from time series of intensities, where N
is the number of time frames, tn represent the time
frame index of the image series (n = 1, t1 = 0 corre-
sponds to the ﬁrst image, n = 2, t2 = 24s corresponds
to the second image, ...) and s determines the loca-
tion of macropixels along the indicated paths in Fig. 1
(starting at ﬁrst sector). An appropriate background
constructed from the 100 time frames (48 min) run-
ning average in time is subtracted from the original
intensities, because a suﬃcient enhanced time-distance
maps is found by setting the N = 100.
It is worth
noting that the periods greater than 48 minutes will be
suppressed from power spectra of intensities time se-
ries by choosing N = 100. For example, time-distance
maps of intensity along the loop 1 for 171˚A and 193 ˚A
before (top panels a) and b)) and after (bottom pan-
els c) and d)) removal of the background intensity are

Intensity as a function of time at
each macropixels of six diﬀerent loop segments which
are shown in Fig. 1 is calculated. Also, variation of
background-subtracted intensities with time at the 5th
macropixel along the loop 1 are shown in the top row
panels (a) and b)) of Fig. 3 and, their FFT power spec-
tral densities in the middle row(c) and d)). Also, the
period-distance maps are shown in the bottom row pan-
els (e) and f)) for 171˚A (left panels), and 193˚A (right
panels). The Fourier power spectra and period-distance
maps of background-subtracted intensity reveal periods
in the range of P = 8-40 minutes (Fig. 3, middle and
bottom row panels). The period-distance maps of in-
tensities show that signiﬁcance levels (> 0.5) are in the
P = 12 − 35(min) oscillation periods range. Further-
more, the spectral power densities factor of intensities
are dominated at some periods between 12 min and 35
min.

4 The method of the physical parameters

calculation

Here, the physical parameters of propagating distur-
bances that are important tools for MHD coronal seis-
mology are extracted with a new method. So, the
Fourier components of the intensity time series at each
macropixel along the loop structure are multiplied with
a Gaussian function of the form

a

′

j =

Nf
X
i=1

ai exp[−

(νi − νj)2

2σ2

],

(2)

′

′

where Nf is the number of the Fourier components,
ai one of the Fourier components, a
j one of the inter-
esting dominant component, σ standard deviation and
a
i transformed coeﬃcients, respectively (subscript in-
dex i and j represent the rank of the harmonics). Also,
νi and νj represent the frequency of the ith and jth
harmonics. In the Fourier transformation, the compo-
nent proportional to the dominant oscillation period is
selected by using a Gaussian ﬁlter with standard devia-
tion σ ≃ (νi+1−νi−1)/2 to enhance time-distance maps.
For example, Fig. 4 shows the time-distance maps of
the loop 1 in 171 ˚A (left panels) and 193˚A (right panels)
with the Gaussian ﬁlter centered on the dominant oscil-
lation periods of intensity. The time-distance maps of
ﬁltered intensities clearly show evidence that acoustic
waves propagate upwardly into the coronal loop 1. In
the next subsections, the physical parameters of prop-
agating disturbances (slow waves) such as phase speed,
damping length, damping time and damping quality

are extracted by analyzing the time series of ﬁltered in-
tensities and their enhanced time-distance maps. Fur-
thermore, the results are compared with the previous
studies.

4.1 The measurement of the projected phase speed

During the last years several methods are used to de-
termine the speed of a propagating disturbances. Many
authors calculated the speed of the propagating distur-
bances from the gradient of the lines by ﬁtting a lin-
ear function to the points with similar amplitude ﬂuc-
tuation of unﬁltered time-distance maps. Also, some
authors measured the speed of the propagating distur-
bances by ﬁtting a propagating harmonic wave function
to the unﬁltered propagating disturbances (see, e.g., De
Moortel et al. 2000; Kiddie et al. 2012; Yuan et al.
2012; Threlfall et al. 2013). Here, the time-distance
maps of ﬁltered intensities that have periodic features,
are used to estimate projected phase speeds of prop-
agating disturbances. For example, Fig. 4 shows the
time-distance of the loop 1 in 171 ˚A (left panels) and
193˚A (right panels) with the Gaussian ﬁlter centered
on the dominant oscillation periods of intensity. The
points that have a maximum upward displacement are
indicated with red color star signs. The solid blue lines
represent a linear function that are ﬁtted to the red star
signs, and the gradient of solid lines are used to estimate
average projected speeds of propagating disturbances
for some particular oscillation periods, also the derived
speed for a particular period have been written in the
respective panels of Fig. 4. It can be seen that oscilla-
tion at a particular period propagates with an almost
constant speed along the loop 1 in both passbands. The
averages and ranges of observed speeds along the six
diﬀerent paths are compiled in Table 1. The averages
and ranges of observed speeds comfortably overlap with
previous ﬁnding by other authors who analyzed similar
observations of propagating ﬂuctuations (see, e.g., De
Moortel et al. 2000; Marsh et al. 2003, 2009; Kiddie et
al. 2012; Yuan et al. 2012; Threlfall et al. 2013; Sych
and Nakariakov, 2014). This method has several ad-
vantages. (1) The time-distance maps of ﬁltered inten-
sities clearly show evidence that acoustic waves prop-
agate upwardly into coronal loops (see Fig.4). (2) To
distinguish the points with maximum displacement (or
points with similar displacement) from these maps is
very much easier than the time-distance maps of unﬁl-
tered intensities, then this method can produce reliable
results. (3) Furthermore, this method reveals how the
magnitude of physical parameters vary depending on
the oscillation periods.

4.2 The measurement of damping of slow waves and

the dependence of damping value on its frequency

Damping of MHD waves have been studied extensively
in coronal structures both theoretically and observa-
tionally since their ﬁrst detection. However, stud-
ies on the dependence of damping value on its fre-
quency are limited.
Fourier power spectral densi-
ties of background-subtracted intensities show that
Fourier components of the intensity time series at each
macropixel along the six diﬀerent paths are only signiﬁ-
cant at some speciﬁed period in the range of P = 10−35
minutes. For example, the period-distance maps con-
structed for loop 1 in the 171 (bottom left panel) and
193 ˚A (bottom right panel), are shown in the Fig. 3.
To estimate the damping length of MHD waves and
the dependence of damping length on its frequency,
the amplitude at a particular period in the range of
P = 12 − 35 minutes is measured by taking the square
root of its power component. The amplitude decay of
ﬁltered intensities at a certain period as function of dis-
tance along the six paths of Fig. 1 is ﬁtted with an
exponential function of the form

A(s) = A0exp(−γds) + C0,

(3)

where, γd is the damping length coeﬃcient, A0 and C0
appropriate constant. The projected damping length
(Ld = 1/γd) of ﬁltered intensity is calculated by Mat-
lab Statistics Toolbox Curve Fitting and Distribu-
tion Fitting. Figure 5 shows a typical example of
the amplitude decay of oscillations as a function of
distance along loop 1 (blue star signs) with P =
28.43, 27.03, 20.14, 20.34, 13.14 and 13.42 min that
an exponential function is ﬁtted to the data (red lines)
in both passbands (171 and 193 ˚A). The ﬁtting param-
eters are written in the top of panels. Also, in order
to compare the dependence of damping length on its
periodicity in Fig. 5, the amplitude at each period is
normalized to the amplitude of a segment along the
path that oscillate with maximum amplitude. Ampli-
tude decay lengths of oscillation as a function of period
are shown for all six diﬀerent paths in Fig. 6. These re-
sults indicate that the projected damping lengths are in
the range of 23 Mm to 68 Mm for periods in the rage be-
tween 12 and 35 min. The observed physical parameters
such as oscillation period P, phase speed Cs, damping
length (Ld), damping time (τd = Ld,est/Cs) and damp-
ing quality (τd/P), for ﬁltered oscillation part of inten-
sity at a sequence of 300 images with 24 s time inter-
vals are listed in Table1 for six diﬀerent loop segments.
The results of data analysis indicate that magnitude of
phase speed and damping time along the six diﬀerent
loop segments are in the range of 38 − 79 km s−1 and

6

τd ≃ 7−21 min, respectively. The magnitudes of damp-
ing quality for dominant oscillation periods in the six
loop segments are in the range of τd/P ≃ 0.35 − 0.77
which clearly show that damping regime is strong for
dominant oscillation periods.

5 Theoretical considerations

Theoretical studies investigating the damping of the
slow wave have concentrated on the eﬀects of thermal
conduction, compressive viscosity, optically thin radia-
tion, gravitational stratiﬁcation and magnetic ﬁeld di-
vergence. Generally, thermal conduction is found to be
the dominant mechanism for dissipation of slow modes
in the solar corona (De Moortel and Hood, 2003, 2004a,
2009; Pandey and Dwivedi 2006; Ofman and Wang,
2002; Van Doorsselaere et al.
2011; Abedini et al.
2012). Here, the coronal loops are considered a ho-
mogeneous plasma medium in the presence of thermal
conduction, compressive viscosity and optically thin ra-
diation dissipation mechanism with constant equilib-
rium values ρ0, T0, p0 and no ﬂow (v0 = 0), also with a
uniform background magnetic ﬁeld along the loops. As-
suming all disturbances in terms of Fourier components
for frequency (ω) and wave number (k) in z-direction,
exp i(kz − ωt), combining linearized MHD equations in
∂T0
the presence of thermal conduction (Ec = ∂
∂z )),
compressive viscosity (Eη = 4
∂z )2) and optically
α) (Sigalotti et al. 2007)
thin radiation (Er = χn2
leads to the following dispersion relation:

found in the range of 38 − 79 km s−1. So,
it can
be concluded that average value of real sound speed
is greater than 38 km s−1. The temperature associ-
ated with Cs = 38 km s−1 is found 0.1 MK by us-
ing the theoretical relation T0 = mC 2
, and by insert-
s
γkB
ing the Boltzmann constant kB = 1.38 × 10−23 JK−1.
In a propagating wave with a speciﬁc oscillation pe-
riod P that has a damping length Ld, it is expected
to have P = 2π/(krCs), and Ld = 1/ki.
In or-
der to estimate damping length, the wave number
of propagation wave associated with oscillation pe-
riod (5 − 40min) at diﬀerent values of temperature
(T0 = 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and‘ 2 MK) is calculated based
on numerical solutions of dispersion relation (4). Plot
of 2π/(krCs) in (min) (top panels) and the estimated
damping length Ld,est = 1/ki in Mm (bottom panels),
as a function of (log(ne/n0), n0 = 104 cm−3) due to
the presence of combining dissipation mechanism are
shown in Fig. 7 for diﬀerent values of temperature and
oscillation period. In each panel of Fig. 7, acceptable
range
(2π/(krCs) = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40
min) of damping length and number density are out-
lined with blue rectangle. An interesting prediction of
this model is that the plots of Ld,est as a function of
(log(ne/n0)) have a maximum in acceptable range. An-
other interesting feature visible in these plots is that
both damping lengths and their maximum value in-
crease with increasing T0 and P. Also, the maximum
point of Ld,est shifts toward bigger electron number den-
sity. These results reveal that treatment of estimated
damping due to the presence of dissipation mechanism
is complex and its value depends not only on the oscil-
lation period but also on the electron number density
and temperature. Moreover, the results based on nu-
merical solutions of dispersion relation illustrate that,
although the damping length and damping time can be
increased with increasing the oscillation periods, the
dependence on periodicity and value of these quantities
strongly depend on the temperature and the electron
number density.

6 Discussion and Conclusions

The aim of this paper is to study the physical param-
eters of longitudinal intensity variations in the large
active-region loop systems by AIA/SDO. So, 300 high
cadence images of loop systems with an interval of 24
seconds in the 171˚A and 193 ˚A are analyzed. First, the
intensity as a function of distance along the six loop seg-
ments is calculated for all times. Then a background
constructed from the 100 point (40 min) running av-
erage in time is subtracted from the original intensi-
ties. For example, the time-distance maps of intensity

along the loop 1 before (panels a) and b )) and after
(panels c) and d)) removal of the background intensity
are shown in top and bottom rows of Fig. 2, respec-
tively. The Fourier power spectra and period-distance
map of ﬂuctuating part of intensities along the loop
segments reveal periods in the range of P ≃ 8 − 40
minutes for both the AIA channels (for example, see
the middle and bottom rows of Fig. 2). Moreover,
the ﬁltered ﬂuctuating intensity of loops shows small
amplitude periodic variations which are interpreted as
evidence for damping of slow magneto-acoustic waves
in loop systems (see bottom panels in Fig. 2 and Fig.
4). This range of oscillation period that has been es-
timated in this study comfortably overlaps with values
quoted by other authors who analyzed similar obser-
vations of propagating ﬂuctuations and MHD theory’s
predictions for the slow wave (see, e.g., De Moortel et
al. 2002, 2003, 2004; Marsh et al. 2003, 2004, 2009,
2011; Krishna et al. 2014, Yuan and Nakariakov 2012,
Kiddie et al. 2012). Time-distance images formed from
the integrated intensity along the loop segments show
that disturbances propagate approximately with a con-
stant speed. Accordingly, the projected speeds of ﬁl-
tered intensity along the 6 loop segments are estimated
for some dominant oscillation period between 12 min
and 35 min, by ﬁtting a linear function to the points
with maximum amplitude ﬂuctuation of time-distance
maps. Also, the damping length (Ld) of oscillation are
calculated by ﬁtting an exponentially decreasing func-
tion to the ﬁltered ﬂuctuation part of intensity proﬁles
(see Fig. 5). Other physical parameters, such as damp-
ing time (τd = Ld/Cs.av) and damping quality (τd/P),
are calculated by using the speeds and damping lengths.
The some results of analysis in the 171 ˚A and 193 ˚A
passbands are listed in Table 1 for diﬀerent loop seg-
ments. These observed results show that:

• The average values of projected speeds for dominant
oscillation periods of six diﬀerent loop segments are
in the range of 38 − 79 km s−1.

• The average values of damping lengths and damping
times are in the range of 23 − 68 Mm and 7 − 21 min,
respectively. Also, its values are sensitive to the os-
cillation period and increase with increasing T0 and
P.

• The magnitude value of damping qualities are ob-
tained in the range of < 1 for ﬁltered intensity which
correspond to strong damping regime.

Also, to compare observed results with the theoreti-
cal MHD prediction, the estimated physical parame-
ters of the slow wave that has concentrated on the ef-
fects of thermal conduction, compressive viscosity and
optically thin radiation is investigated. The damp-
ing lengths of ﬁltered intensities as function of electron

min) are calculated at dominant oscillation periods for diﬀerent values of temperature (T0 = 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 MK).

number density based on the theoretical MHD predic-
tion are shown in Fig. 7 for diﬀerent values of tem-
perature (T0 = 0.1, 0.5, 1.5 and 2 MK). The magni-
tudes of estimated damping lengths and other physi-
cal parameters in the acceptable range (2π/(Cskr) ≃
5, 10, ..., 35, and 40 min) are listed in Table 2. These
results show that:

• In the presence of three dissipation mechanisms to-
gether damping lengths and damping times increase
with increasing temperature and oscillation period
but damping qualities decrease with increasing tem-
perature (see Table 2)

• The plots of damping length as function of electron
number density have a maximum in acceptable range
(see Fig. 7).

• The damping lengths and their maximum value in-
crease with increasing T0 and P. Also, the maximum
point of plots shift toward bigger electron number
density.

• The dependence on periodicity and value of damping
length strongly depend on the temperature and the
electron number density. These theoretical results re-
veal that treatment of estimated damping due to the
presence of all three dissipation mechanisms is com-
plex and its value depends not only on the oscillation
period but also on the electron number density and
temperature.

The magnitudes of observed damping times and damp-
ing qualities are independent of the LOS. comparing the
observed damping times and dependence of damping
times on their periods with the theoretically predicted
values, it can be seen at low periods (P < 15 min), the
damping times and the dependence of damping times
on their periods of propagating slow magneto-acoustic
waves in the gravitationally stratiﬁed loops that are sit-
uated above active regions may be explained by consid-
ering three dissipation mechanisms in an especial range
of electron number density (ne ≃ 107 − 1012 cm−3)
but at high periods the other dissipation mechanism
must be considered. Also, It can be concluded that the
behavior of propagating slow magneto-acoustic waves
along the corona loops, in addition to the dispersion
mechanism, can depend on the other quantities such as
temperature, electron number density, and so on.

I thank the anonymous referee, Dr. Mike Marsh and
Dr. H. Safari for the very helpful comments and sug-
gestions.
