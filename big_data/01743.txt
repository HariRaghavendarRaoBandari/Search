UNIQUENESS OF CONSTANT SCALAR CURVATURE
K ¨AHLER METRICS WITH CONE SINGULARITIES, I:

REDUCTIVITY

LONG LI AND KAI ZHENG

Abstract. The aim of this paper is to prove the reductivity for
conic constant scalar curvature K¨ahler metrics, when the cone an-
gle is less than π. We introduce a new H¨older space called C 4,α,β
to investigate the fourth order elliptic equation, and prove that
any C 2,α,β conic cscK metric is indeed of class C 4,α,β. Finally, the
reductivity is established by a useful integration by parts formula
for the conic Lichnerowicz operator.

1. Introduction

Bando-Mabuchi [2] proved that K¨ahler-Einstein metrics on Fano
manifolds are unique up to holomorphic automorphisms in 1980s. Re-
cently, Berndtsson [4] generalized this uniqueness result to conic K¨ahler-
Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds, by his observation on the convexity
of certain energy functional (the Ding-functional) along geodesics in
the space of all K¨ahler potentials. And Berndtsson’s method is further
generalized to prove the uniqueness of singular K¨ahler-Einstein metrics
on klt-paris [5].

For the uniqueness of constant scalar curvature K¨ahler (cscK) met-
rics [9], the convexity of the so called Mabuchi’s functional turns out
to be a very important ingredient. And this convexity is proved by the
work of Berman-Berndtsson [3] and also independently by Chen-Li-
P˘aun [8]. Moreover, in a recent work of the ﬁrst author [14], the con-
vexity is generalized to conic Mabuchi’s functional along any geodesics
in the space C1,¯1
β . However, according to the work of Calami-Zheng [6],
the existence of such geodesic is only known for small angles (β < 1/2)
up to this stage. Therefore, we will ﬁrst discuss the uniqueness of
conic cscK metrics when the cone angle is less than π in this paper
(and sequel ones).

In the previous joint work [15], we used Bando-Mabuchi’s old idea to
recover Berndtsson’s result in the conic setting. And it turns out that
the reductivity of the automorphism group Aut(X, D) (all holomorphic
automorphisms on X which ﬁx the divisor D) is a starting point to work
with uniqueness problems, either for conic K¨ahler-Einstein or cscK
metrics. Hence the current paper is devoted to study the reductivity for

1

2

conic cscK metrics. More precisely, we generalized the Lichnerowicz-
Calabi theorem [Theorem (4.1)] to the conic setting.

A pair (α, β) of real numbers is named to be under the small angle

conidtion if α ∈ (0, 1) and β ∈ (0, 1/2) satisfying αβ < 1 − 2β

Theorem 1.1. Suppose a compact complex K¨ahler manifold X admits
a C2,α,β conic cscK metrics under the small angle condition. Then the
automorphism group Aut(X, D) is reductive.

Donaldson [11] introduced some H¨older spaces (C,α,β, C2,α,β) to study
the regularity property of the Laplace operator associated with a conic
metric. Note that the Laplace operator is exactly the principle part
of the linearized operator for K¨ahler-Einstein equation. Similarly, the
linearized operator for cscK metrics is called the Lichnerowicz operator
D, which is a 4th. order elliptic diﬀerential operator. In order to study
the regularity property of this operator, we introduced a new H¨older
space C4,α,β, which is simply deﬁned by one more relation to u ∈ C2,α,β

(1.1)

∆Ω0u ∈ C2,α,β,

where Ω0 is a local model cone metric. This is a well deﬁned, Banach
space equipped with a norm || · ||C 4,α,β . Very interestingly, we can es-
timate the growth rates for all 3rd. and 4th. order derivatives of any
u ∈ C4,α,β from this simple relation (equation (1.1)). The computation
for the 3rd. order derivatives are very similar to Brendle’s calculation
[1], but it is more subtle for the 4th. order derivatives (Riemannian
curvatures).

Next we proved a regularity theorem that any C2,α,β conic cscK met-
ric is indeed of class C4,α,β. This is basically done by Donaldson’s es-
timates and Brendle’s trick [1]. Thanks to these two important tools,
we also proved a rough Schauder estimate for D operator induced by
a conic cscK metric. And this gives a chance to lift the regularities of
potentials which are in the kernel of D operator.

Finally, reductivity is proved by the following decomposition

(1.2)

Y = Y // ⊕ Y ⊥

where Y is any holomorphic vector ﬁeld on X tangential to the divisor
D, Y // is a parallel holomorphic vector ﬁeld tangential to D, and Y ⊥
is the image under gradg of some function u ∈ ker D. And this is done
by proving a kind of Hodge decomposition to the lifting of Y ﬁrst, and
then an integration by parts formula for the Lichnerowicz operator
establishes the one-one correspondence.

In the sequel paper [16], we establish a linear theory for the Lich-
nerowicz operator, which implies that the operator D : C4,α,β → C,α,β
has closed range. And this enable us to generalize the Bifurcation
technique [9] to conic cscK metrics.

2. A new H¨older space

Let (X, ω0) be a compact K¨ahler manifold with complex dimension
n, and D is a simple smooth divisor on X. Suppose (LD, h) is the line
bundle induced by the divisor D with a metric h, and s is a non-trivial
holomorphic section of it.

A pair of real numbers (α, β) is called under the small angle condi-

tion, if α ∈ (0, 1) and β ∈ (0, 1/2) satisfy αβ < 1 − 2β.

For arbitrary point p ∈ D, we can introduce a local coordinate chart
(ζ, z2, · · · , zn) in an open neighborhood U centered at p, such that the
divisor is deﬁned by the zero locus of ζ in U. And we call it as the
z-coordinate. Writing ζ = ρeiθ in polar coordinate, we can introduce
another local coordinate as (ξ, w2, · · · , wn), where

ξ := reiθ,

r = ρβ,

and wj := zj for all j > 1. And we call it as the w-coordinate (Not
holomorphic!).

In z-coordinate, we denote Ω0 by the local model cone metric

Ω0 = β2|ζ|2β−2idζ ∧ d¯ζ +Xj>1

idzj ∧ d¯zj.

Then a conic K¨ahler metric ω is deﬁned as a positive closed (1, 1)
current on X, smooth on X − D, such that it is quasi-isometric to Ω0
near each point p on D. That is to say, on a open neighborhood U of
any p ∈ D, we have

for some constant C > 0.

C −1Ω0 ≤ ω ≤ CΩ0,

2.1. Higher order H¨older spaces. From now on, we adapt to the
following summation conventions:

(a) Greek letters like α, β, µ, ν, · · · represent all indexes ζ, 2, · · · , n;
(b) English letters like k, l, i, j, · · · only reprent indexes 2, · · · , n.
According to Donaldson [11], we denote C,α,β by the space of all
real valued functions f of the form f (ζ, z2, · · · , zn) = ˜f (ξ, w2, · · · , wn)
where ˜f ∈ C α. And C,α,β
denotes the space of all functions f ∈ C,α,β

0

4

LONG LI AND KAI ZHENG

such that f (0, z2, · · · , zn) = 0. A (1, 0) form

τ := τζdζ +Xk>1

τkdzk

in z-coordinate is said to be of class C,α,β if its coeﬃcients satisfy

ρ1−βτζ ∈ C,α,β

0

;

τk ∈ C,α,β.

And a (0, 1) form τ ′ is of class C,α,β if τ ′ ∈ C,α,β. Moreover, a (1, 1)-
form

σ := σζ ¯ζdζ ∧ d¯ζ +Xk>1

σζ¯ldζ ∧ d¯zl +Xk>1

σk ¯ζdzk ∧ d¯ζ + Xk,l>1

σk¯ldzk ∧ d¯zl

is said to be of class C,α,β if

σk¯l ∈ C,α,β; ρ1−βσζ¯l, ρ1−βσk ¯ζ ∈ C,α,β

0

; ρ2−2βσζ ¯ζ ∈ C,α,β.

Donaldson [11] also introduced the following H¨older space of the second
order as

C2,α,β := {u ∈ C 2

R(X − D)| u, ∂u, ∂ ¯∂u ∈ C,α,β}.

We call a complex valued function f is of class C,α,β (C2,α,β), if both
the real part and imaginary part of f are of class C,α,β (C2,α,β).

Moreover, we can consider a new H¨older space of the 4th. order as

Deﬁnition 2.1.

C4,α,β := {u ∈ C 2,α,β∩C 4

R(X −D)| ρ2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζu ∈ C2,α,β, ∂k∂¯lu ∈ C2,α,β}.
Notice that the operator i∂ ¯∂ is real, and the deﬁnition makes sense

even when u is complex valued.

Remark 2.2. According to Brendle’s computation (Appendix A.1 [1]),
the small angle condition gives us a slightly better growth estimate for
C2,α,β functions. In fact, if u ∈ C2,α,β, then we have

ρ1−2β(∂u)ζ ∈ C,α,β.

Recall that in z-coordinate, we denote Ω0 by the local model cone

metric

Ω0 = β2|ζ|2β−2idζ ∧ d¯ζ +Xj>1

idzj ∧ d¯zj.

Thanks to Donaldson’s estimate, we have another description of the
H¨older space C4,α,β.

Proposition 2.3. We have the following equivalence

C4,α,β = {u ∈ C2,α,β ∩ C 4

R(X − D)| ∆Ω0u ∈ C2,α,β}.

REMARK

Proof. Suppose u is a C2,α,β function such that ∆Ω0u ∈ C2,α,β, and then
we have

∆Ω0(∂k∂¯lu) = β−2|ζ|2−2β∂ζ ∂¯ζ∂k∂¯lu +Xi>1

∂i∂¯i∂k∂¯lu

(2.1)
Then ∂k∂¯lu is of class C2,α,β by Donaldson’s estimates. This implies
that

= ∂k∂¯l∆Ω0u ∈ C,α,β.

and we also have

|ζ|2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζ ∂k∂¯lu ∈ C,α,β,

∆Ω0(|ζ|2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζu) = β−2|ζ|2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζ(|ζ|2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζ u) +Xk>1

(2.2)

= |ζ|2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζ∆Ω0u.

|ζ|2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζ∂k∂¯ku

Hence |ζ|2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζu ∈ C2,α,β, and the result follows.

(cid:3)

From this new description, we infer that the deﬁnition of C4,α,β is
independent of holomorphic coordinate charts, and it is a Banach space.
And we will discuss further details later (see Section 5, Fundamentals
of C4,α,β space).

Now we can estimate the growth rate of the 3rd. order derivatives

of a C4,α,β function by Donaldson’s estimate.

Lemma 2.4. For any u ∈ C4,α,β, we have
∂k∂¯l∂iu ∈ C,α,β,
ρ1−β∂k∂¯ζ∂iu ∈ C,α,β
ρ1−β∂ζ∂¯l∂ku ∈ C,α,β
,
ρ2−2β∂ζ ∂¯ζ∂ku ∈ C,α,β,

,

0

for all k, l, i > 1.

Proof. According to Donaldson’s estimate, it is enough to prove on
X − D

∆Ω0v ∈ C,α,β,

where v = ∂ku ∈ C,α,β, and Ω0 is the local model metric near a point
on D. Then we can compute the Laplacian as

∆Ω0(∂ku) = β−2ρ2−2β∂ζ ∂¯ζ∂ku +Xj>1

∂j∂¯j∂ku,

but ∂(∂ζ ∂¯ζu) is of class C,α,β as a (1, 0) form

∂k(|ζ|2−2β∂ζ ∂¯ζu) = |ζ|2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζ∂ku ∈ C,α,β,

and the lemma follows since ∂j∂¯j∂ku ∈ C,α,β for each j > 1.

Suppose s is a holomorphic section of D, and h is a Hermitian metric

on the line bundle D. Put

Ω := ω0 + λddc|s|2β
h .

For λ > 0 small enough, Ω is a conic K¨ahler metric, and we call it as
the model conic K¨ahler metric with angle 2πβ along D. Notice that
the potential |s|2β
h is in the H¨older space C2,α,β. Moreover, the growth
rate of the 3rd. and 4th. order derivatives of |s|2β

h is computable.

We call ωϕ := ω0 + ddcϕ as a C2,α,β(C4,α,β) conic K¨ahler metric if ωϕ

is a conic K¨ahler metric and ϕ is of class C2,α,β(C4,α,β).

Lemma 2.6. Under the small angle condition, the model metric Ω is
a C4,α,β conic K¨ahler metric.

Proof. Writing ω0 = ddcφ0 locally, it is enough to prove that the func-
tion φ0 + |s|2β
h is of class C4,α,β. But this directly follows from Brendle’s
computation (Lemma 3.3, [1]).
(cid:3)

Remark 2.7. Note here mixed derivatives are not involved in the cal-
culation of Lemma (2.6). In fact, the derivative ρ1−β∂ζ ∂¯l(φ0 + |s|2
h) is
NOT of class C2,α,β by Brendle’s computation.

Now we want to compare a general C2,α,β conic metric with the model

metric Ω.

Deﬁnition 2.8. Suppose a pair (α, β) is under the small angle condi-
tion, and let ωϕ be a C2,α,β conic K¨ahler metric. We say ωϕ has the
model growth in the 3rd. order if its Christoﬀel symbols satisfy

2.2. Curvature tensors. Before continuing the calculation, we would
like to introduce some conventions

Deﬁnition 2.12. A tensor in the z-coordinate denoted by

Ξζ,··· ,¯ζ,A
ζ,··· ,¯ζ,B

is called cone admissible if

|ζ|(p−q)(1−β)Ξζ,··· ,¯ζ,A

ζ,··· ,¯ζ,B ∈ C,α,β,

where p is number of all ζ, ¯ζ appearing in the upper indices of Ξ, q is
the number of all ζ, ¯ζ appearing in the lower indices, and A, B only
consist of indices which are bigger than 1.

Deﬁnition 2.13. Let Γγ
metric. We denote by ˜Γγ

µλ the following tensor

and

˜Γζ
ζζ = Γζ

if any one of the indices γ, µ, λ is not equal to ζ.

it is easy to see that its Christoﬀel symbols Γγ

tensors except one Γζ
µλ are cone admissible tensor
for all indices γ, µ, λ.

Moreover, take a local function in z-coordinate

φ := −(1 − β) log |ζ|2.

We introduce a new ﬁrst order diﬀerential operator ∂φ as

∂φ := |ζ|2β−2∂(|ζ|2−2β·),

and in each direction, it can be computed as
∂φ
ζ = ∂ζ + (1 − β)ζ −1·, ∂φ

Proof. On the tangential direction zj, it is easy to have

∂j∂¯j(ζ∂ζ∂¯lu) = ζ(∂ζ∂¯l∂j∂¯ju) = O(ρβ).

On the normal direction, we have

∂ζ∂¯ζ (ζ∂ζ∂¯lu) = ζ∂ζ∂¯ζ ∂ζ∂¯lu + ∂¯ζ∂ζ∂¯lu

But thanks to Lemma (2.15), we have

ζ|ζ|2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζ∂ζ∂¯lu ∈ C,α,β,

|ζ|2−2β∂¯ζ∂ζ∂¯lu ∈ C,α,β,

Then equation (2.16) follows. Now equation (2.20) follows from the
calculation

|ζ|2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζ(|ζ|2−2β∂k∂¯lu) = |ζ|4−4β{∂ζ∂¯ζu,k¯l + (1 − β)ζ −1∂¯ζu,k¯l

(2.23)

+ (1 − β)¯ζ −1(∂ζ∂ζ∂¯lu + (1 − β)ζ −1∂ζ∂¯lu)}
= O(ρ1−2β).

The last line follows from Lemma (2.5), and equation (2.21) follows. (cid:3)

Lemma 2.17. Let u and v be two C4,α,β functions, and then we have

|ζ|2−2β(∂ζ∂¯lu)(∂k∂¯ζv)

is of class C2,α,β for any ﬁxed k, l > 1. In particular,

|ζ|2−2β(∂ζ∂¯lu)(∂k∂¯ζu) ∈ C2,α,β,

for any k, l > 1.

Proof. Put

Φ := |ζ|2−2β(∂ζ∂¯lu)(∂k∂¯ζ v),

and then it is enough to prove ∆Ω0Φ is of class C,α,β. But on the
tangential directions, we have

∂j∂¯jΦ = |ζ|2−2β{(∂j∂¯j∂ζ∂¯lu · ∂k∂¯ζ v + ∂j∂¯l∂ζu · ∂¯j∂k∂¯ζv)

(2.24)

+ (∂¯j∂ζ∂¯lu · ∂j∂¯ζ ∂kv + ∂j∂¯j∂k∂¯ζv · ∂ζ∂¯lu)}.

On the normal direction to the divisor, we have

|ζ|2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζΦ = |ζ|4−4β{(∂¯l∂ζ∂¯ζ ∂ζu + (1 − β)ζ −1∂¯l∂ζ ∂¯ζu) · ∂k∂¯ζ v

+ (∂k∂¯ζ∂ζ∂¯ζ v + (1 − β)¯ζ −1∂k∂¯ζ∂ζ v) · ∂ζ∂¯lu

+ ∂¯ζ∂ζ∂¯lu · ∂ζ∂¯ζ ∂kv}

Thanks to Lemma (2.15) and (2.4), equation (2.24) and (2.25) imply
that

Lemma 2.18. Let ω be a C4,α,β metric, and then we can estimate the
growth rate of its volume form

|ζ|2−2β det g ∈ C2,α,β.

In particular, |ζ|2β−2g ¯ζζ ∈ C2,α,β and g¯lk ∈ C2,α,β for all k, l > 1.

Proof. Thanks to Lemma (2.17), the estimate follows from the expan-
sion formula of the volume form ωn, i.e.

(2.26)

det g = (gζ ¯ζ − Xk,l>1

(Gζ ¯ζ)

¯lkgζ¯lgk ¯ζ) det Gζ ¯ζ,

where Gζ ¯ζ is the complimentary matrix of g with respect to gζ ¯ζ, and
det Gζ ¯ζ ∈ C2,α,β. Notice the conic metric g is non-degenerate, and then
we can assume |ζ|2−2β det g > 1 and det Gζ ¯ζ > 1 locally. Therefore, the
inverse matrix of g can be expressed as

|ζ|2β−2g

¯ζζ =

det Gζ ¯ζ

|ζ|2−2β det g

∈ C2,α,β.

For the tangential directions, we have

¯lk =

g

|ζ|2−2β det Gk¯l
|ζ|2−2β det g

∈ C2,α,β,

since the numerator |ζ|2−2β det Gk¯l is of class C2,α,β by the same reason
with |ζ|2−2β det g.
(cid:3)

Take the Ricci potential of C4,α,β conic K¨ahler metric ω as

φ := − log

|s|2−2β

.

Then we can estimate the growth rate of the Ricci curvature of ω near
the divisor.

0

, ρ1−βRk ¯ζ ∈ C,α,β

, Rk¯l ∈ C,α,β.

Proof. It is enough to prove ∂ ¯∂φ is of class C,α,β as a (1, 1) form, and
this is true if e−φ ∈ C2,α,β provided the non-degeneracy of the metric.
But e−φ is equal to h(|ζ|2−2β det g) locally, where h > 0 is a smooth
function. Hence the corollary follows from Lemma (2.18).

Lemma 2.20. For each ﬁxed j > 1, the curvature tensor

LONG LI AND KAI ZHENG

Proof. Note for j > 1, the tensor gj¯j is of class C2,α,β, and all the third
order terms like ∂µgj ¯ν, ∂ ¯βgλ¯j are cone admissible. Hence the lemma
follows from the following

(2.27)

Rµ ¯βj¯j = ∂µ∂ ¯βgj¯j − g ¯νλ∂µgj ¯ν∂ ¯βgλ¯j.

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.21. The curvature tensor on the normal direction

Rµ ¯βζ ¯ζ
is cone admissible for all indices µ, β.

Proof. There are four cases, which correspond to diﬀerent choices of µ
and β:

Case 1 Let µ = ζ, β = ζ, and we have

Rζ ¯ζζ ¯ζ = ∂ζ∂¯ζgζ ¯ζ − g ¯νλ∂ζ gζ ¯ν∂¯ζgλ¯ζ.

However, we further have

∂φ

¯ζ gζ ¯ζ = |ζ|2β−2∂ζ {∂¯ζ(|ζ|2−2βgζ ¯ζ)}
= ∂ζ∂¯ζ gζ ¯ζ + (1 − β)ζ −1∂¯ζgζ ¯ζ
+ (1 − β)¯ζ −1∂ζgζ ¯ζ + (1 − β)2|ζ|−2gζ ¯ζ.

(2.28)

Moreover,
ζ gζ ¯ν∂φ
g ¯νλ∂φ

¯ζ gλ¯ζ = g ¯νλ(∂ζgζ ¯ν + (1 − β)ζ −1gζ ¯ν)(∂¯ζgλ¯ζ + (1 − β)¯ζ −1gλ¯ζ)

= g ¯νλ∂ζgζ ¯ν∂¯ζ gλ¯ζ + (1 − β)ζ −1δλζ∂¯ζgλ¯ζ
+ (1 − β)¯ζ −1δνζ∂ζ gζ ¯ν + (1 − β)2|ζ|−2δλζgλ¯ζ

+ (1 − β)¯ζ −1∂ζgζ ¯ζ + (1 − β)2|ζ|−2gζ ¯ζ.
Subtract equation (2.29) from (2.28), and then we have

(2.29)

Rζ ¯ζζ ¯ζ = ∂φ

¯ζ gζ ¯ζ is cone admissible since |ζ|2−2βgζ ¯ζ is of class C2,α,β, and all
¯ζ gλ¯ζ are cone admissible by Proposition

ζ gζ ¯ν, ∂φ

Case 2 Let µ = k > 1, β = ζ, and we have

Rk ¯ζζ ¯ζ = ∂k∂¯ζgζ ¯ζ − g ¯νλ∂kgζ ¯ν∂¯ζgλ¯ζ
¯ζ gλ¯ζ,

(2.30)

¯ζ gζ ¯ζ − g ¯νλ∂kgζ ¯ν∂φ
by a similar computation as in Case 1. Now ∂k∂φ
¯ζ gζ ¯ζ is cone admissible
since |ζ|2−2βgζ ¯ζ ∈ C2,α,β, and the remaining third order terms are all
cone admissible too.

Case 3 Let µ = ζ, β = l > 1. This case is similar to Case 2, so
we do not repeat the argument here.

Case 4 Let µ = k, β = l > 1, and we have

Rk¯lζ ¯ζ = Rζ ¯ζk¯l = ∂ζ∂¯ζgk¯l − g ¯νλ∂ζgk¯ν∂¯ζgλ¯l,

but gk¯l is of class C2,α,β, and all the third order terms like ∂ζ gk¯ν, ∂¯ζgλ¯l
are cone admissible by Proposition (2.9).

3. conic cscK metrics

In the ﬁrst author’s previous work [14], three diﬀerent notions of
conic cscK metrics are discussed. Under the small angle condition, a
slightly diﬀerent notion will be introduced from the view of Monge-
Amp`ere equations. We will eventually see that it coincides with the so
called strong conic cscK metrics in [14].

Recall that Ω is the model conic K¨ahler metric, and we write

hα ¯βdzα ∧ d¯zβ,

Ω :=Xα,β

in local coordinate charts. All Christoﬀel symbols of h are denoted by
Υµ

γα. Now we introduce the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 3.1. A C2,α,β conic cscK metric is a conic K¨ahler metric
ω := Ω+ ddcu with u ∈ C2,α,β such that it satisﬁes the following Monge-
Amp`ere equation on X − D

(3.1)

(Ω + ddcu)n = eF Ωn,

where the real-valued function F is the solution of the following elliptic
equation on X − D

(3.2)

∆ωF = trωRic(Ω) − c(β),

where c(β) is a topological constant.

Note here we adapt to the normalization

ZX−D

eF Ωn = [Ω]n.

Based on these elliptic equations, we can lift the regularity of the conic
cscK metric as follows.

Theorem 3.2. Suppose u ∈ C2,α,β is the potential of a conic cscK
metric ω. Then u is of class C4,α,β under the small angle condition.

Thanks to Lemma (2.6) and Corollary (2.19), equation (3.2) implies
that the function F is of class C2,α,β by Donaldson’s estimate. Writing
equation (3.1) as

Ric(ω) = Ric(Ω) − ddcF,

14

LONG LI AND KAI ZHENG

we conclude that the Ricci curvature of ω is cone admissible. Now we
claim the conic cscK metric ω has the model growth in the 3rd. order,
and the proof is basically Brendle’s computation.

Lemma 3.3. We have

,

∂k∂¯l∂iu ∈ C,α,β,
ρ1−β∂k∂¯ζ∂iu ∈ C,α,β
ρ1−β∂ζ∂¯l∂ku ∈ C,α,β
,
ρ2−2β∂ζ ∂¯ζ∂ku ∈ C,α,β,
ρ2−2β∂φ
ζ ∂¯l∂ζu = O(ραβ),

0

0

for all k, l, i > 1.

Proof. Diﬀerentiating equation (3.1) in the tangential direction zk, we
have

∆ω(∂ku) = trΩ(∂kΩ) + ∂kF − trω(∂kΩ).

For suﬃcient small α > 0, the (1, 1) form ∂kΩ is of class C,α,β. This
implies trΩ(∂kΩ) ∈ C,α,β and trω(∂kΩ) ∈ C,α,β, since ω is uniformly
equivalent to Ω and of class C,α,β. Moreover, ∂kF ∈ C,α,β implies
∆ω(∂ku) ∈ C,α,β. Therefore, ﬁrst four lines of the lemma follow from
∂ku ∈ C2,α,β.

Now take v = ∂¯lu, and then we have

|ζ|2−2β∂ζ ∂¯ζv ∈ C,α,β.

Hence we conclude the estimate

∂φ
ζ ∂ζ∂¯lu = O(|ζ|αβ),

thanks to Brendle’s Appendix [1] again.

(cid:3)

Let D denote by the connection associated with Ω, and we can fur-

ther estimate all the third covariant derivatives.

Lemma 3.4. We have

(D3u)(∂i, ∂¯l, ∂k) ∈ C,α,β,
ρ1−β(D3u)(∂i, ∂¯ζ, ∂k) ∈ C,α,β
ρ1−β(D3u)(∂ζ, ∂¯l, ∂k) ∈ C,α,β
,
ρ2−2β(D3u)(∂ζ, ∂¯ζ, ∂k) ∈ C,α,β,

0

0

for all i, k, l > 1. Moreover, we have

ρ2−2β(D3u)(∂ζ, ∂¯l, ∂ζ) = O(ραβ),

for all l > 1.

Proof. Note that Ω has the model growth in the 3rd. order, and then
all the Christoﬀel symbols ˜Υγ
αµ are cone admissible. Therefore, the
result follows directly from Lemma (3.3).

ζζu,γ ¯ζ).

(cid:3)

Then by the standard computation, we proved the following

Corollary 3.6. A C2,α,β conic cscK metric ω has the model growth in
the 3rd. order.

In order to prove ∆Ω0u ∈ C2,α,β, it is enough to prove u,j¯j ∈ C2,α,β
and |ζ|2−2βu,ζ ¯ζ ∈ C2,α,β. And it is comparatively easy to control the
growth in tangential directions.

Lemma 3.7. We have

for all j > 1.

∂k∂¯lu ∈ C2,α,β,

Proof. Recall that all the Ricci curvature of ω is of class C,α,β, and the
Ricci tensor can be written as

Rk¯l = ∆ωgk¯l − g

¯βαg ¯νµ∂kgα¯ν∂¯lgµ ¯β ∈ C,α,β.

Therefore we have

∆ωgk¯l ∈ C,α,β,

since all the three tensors like ∂kgα¯ν, ∂¯lgµ ¯β are cone admissible thanks to
Lemma (3.3). Then the result follows from Donaldson’s estimate. (cid:3)

Lemma 3.8. We have

|ζ|2−2β∂ζ ∂¯ζu ∈ C2,α,β.

|ζ|2−2β∇ζ(g ¯βαu,¯ζα ¯β) = |ζ|2−2β∂ζ ∂¯ζF ∈ C,α,β,

4. Reductivity

Let Aut(X; D) be the group of holomorphic automorphism of X
which ﬁxes the divisor D. There is a one-one correspondence between
Aut(X; D) and the space h(X; D) of all holomorphic vector ﬁelds tan-
gential to the divisor. Note that h(X; D) is a Lie algebra since we
have

[h(X; D), h(X; D)] = h(X; D).

Then we can generalize the Lichnerowicz-Calabi theorem to the conic
setting.

Theorem 4.1. Suppose ω is a C2,α,β conic cscK metric on X. Then
the Lie algebra h(X; D) has a semidirect sum decomposition:

(4.1)

h(X; D) = a(X; D) ⊕ h′(X; D),

where a(X; D) is the complex Lie subalgebra of h(X; D) consisting of
all parallel holomorphic vector ﬁelds tangential to D, and h′(X; D) is
an ideal of h(X; D) consisting of the image under gradg of the kernel
of D operator.

Furthermore h′(X; D) is the complexiﬁcation of a Lie algebra consist-
ing of Killing vector ﬁelds of X tangential to D. In particular h′(X; D)
and h(X; D) are reductive.

4.1. Hodge decomposition. Let ω be a C2,α,β conic cscK metric, and
Y be a holomorphic vector ﬁeld on X tangential to D. The induced
(0, 1) form of Y by ω is

and

τ :=↓ω Y,

τ¯ζ = gζ ¯ζY ζ +Xk>1
τ¯l = gζ¯lY ζ +Xk>1

gk ¯ζY k,

gk¯lY k.

As a (0, 1) form, τ is of class C,α,β since ρ1−βτ¯ζ ∈ C,α,β
and τ¯l ∈ C,α,β,
and it is easy to see τ is closed on X − D by a local computation [12].
Let ϑ be the formal adjoint of ¯∂ operator acting on functions with
respect to the metric ω. It is not clear that this operator ϑ has closed
range, but we can compute it outside the divisor.

¯ζk∇kτ¯ζ ∈ C,α,β, g

¯lζ∇ζτ¯l ∈ C,α,β g

¯lk∇kτ¯l ∈ C,α,β.

In other words, the function ϑτ is in the class C,α,β. Now consider

the following Laplacian equation:

(4.7)

∆ωu = ϑτ.

REMARK

19

Notice that ∆ω is a real operator. Thanks to the linear theory es-
tablished in [6], there exists a weak solution u ∈ W 1,2(ω) satisfying
equation (4.7). Then by Donaldson’s estimate (Theorem 2.5, [1]), we
conclude that u ∈ C2,α,β. Indeed, we can lift its regularities to a higher
order.

Proposition 4.2. The solution u of the Lapalacian equation

is of class C4,α,β.

∆ωu = ϑτ

In fact, the function u is in the kernel of the so called Lichnerowicz
operator D of the conic cscK metric ω (see Section 4.2) outside of the
divisor. Hence we have

∆2

ωu = −R

¯βαu,α ¯β ∈ C,α,β,

on X − D. Now thanks to Donaldson’s estimate and the fact that D
is a real operator, we further have

∆ωu ∈ C2,α,β.

And note that u is smooth outside of the divisor by standard elliptic
estimates. Then Proposition (4.2) follows directly from the following
rough Schauder estimate for the operator D

Proposition 4.3. Let ω be a C4,α,β conic cscK metric, and D be the
Lichnerowicz operator associated to ω. Suppose that u is of class C2,α,β∩
C 4(X − D) and f is of class C,α,β such that Du = f away from the
divisor. Then u is of class C4,α,β.

Note that ∆ωu is again of class C2,α,β by the same argument with

above, and we have the following lemmas

Lemma 4.4. For each ﬁxed j > 1, we have

∂ju ∈ C2,α,β.

Proof. Take the one derivative in k direction with repect to the Lapla-
cian equation

∂j(∆ωu) = g ¯βα∂ju,α ¯β − g ¯βα(Γγ

jαu,γ ¯β) ∈ C,α,β.

Since the tensor Γγ

jα is cone admissible for all γ, α, we have

¯βα∂ju,α ¯β ∈ C,α,β,
and the lemma follows from Donaldson’s estimate.

∆ω(∂ju) = g

Finally if we take γ = τ − ¯∂u, then γ is a (0, 1) form of class C,α,β
too. Moreover, γ is ¯∂-harmonic outside the divisor, in the sense that

¯∂γ = 0; ϑγ = 0,

on X − D. Therefore, we proved the following lemma.

Lemma 4.8. Suppose τ is the lifting of a holomorphic vector ﬁeld Y
tangential to the divisor by the metric ω. It can be decomposed into
two parts

(4.15)
where u ∈ C4,α,β, γ ∈ C,α,β and γ is ¯∂-harmonic outside D.

τ = γ + ¯∂u,

4.2. Lichnerowicz operator. For a ﬁxed smooth K¨ahler metric ω0,
we denote by Lω0 : C ∞

diﬀerential operator (not real!)

ω0 is the formal adjoint of Lω0 with respect to the L2-inner

Now we want to consider these operators in the conic setting. Recall
that ω is a C2,α,β conic cscK metrics. Then it is indeed of class C4,α,β
according to Theorem (3.2). We deﬁne

D : C4,α,β → C,α,β

as a 4th. order diﬀerential operator

Du = ∆2

where the covariant derivative ∇ and curvature R are all respect to the

According to Corollary (2.19), the second term R¯νµ∇µ∇¯νu in the

(cid:3)

Next we are going to establish a one-one correspondence between the
kernel of D and all holomorphic vector ﬁelds on X tangential to the
divisor.

Lemma 4.11. Suppose u ∈ C4,α,β is in the kernel of D. Then the lifting
of u by the metric ω is a holomorphic vector ﬁeld on X tangential to
D.
Proof. Let Z be the lifting of ¯∂u under the metric ω. That is to say

Z =↑ω ¯∂u,

and

Z ζ = g

Z k = g ¯ζk∂¯ζ u +Xl>1

Notice that Z ζ converges to zero and Z k converges to its smooth part

Pl>1 g¯lk∂¯lu, when the point approaches the divisor. Moreover, the

vector ﬁeld Z is holomorphic on X − D, since Lgu = 0 outside the
divisor thanks to Lemma (4.19). Therefore, near each point p ∈ D,
we can extend the coeﬃcients Z ζ, Z k across the divisor as holomorphic
functions. Let ˜Z be the holomorphic extension of Z. In prior, the value
of ˜Z depends on the local coordinate. However, the normal direction
of ˜Z always vanishes, and we have

˜Z|D =Xk>1

(Xl>1

g¯lk∂¯lu)

∂

which implies our extension does not depend on the local coordinates.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 4.1. Let Y be an element of h(X; D). According to
the hodge decomposition (Lemma 4.8), the induced (0, 1) form τ of Y
can be written as

τ = γ + ¯∂u,

26

LONG LI AND KAI ZHENG

where γ is ¯∂-harmonic outside of D. Then we have on X − D

Du = ∇α∇β∇β∇αu = ∇α∇β∇β(Y α − ˜γα)

= −∇α(∇β∇β ˜γα − R βα
= 0,

β µ˜γµ) = −(∇¯µR)γ¯µ

(4.24)
where ˜γ is the lifting of γ by ω. Notice that Du is of class C,α,β, and
then the function u ∈ C4,α,β is in the kernel of D. Furthermore, we
have

Lgu = 0,

thanks to Lemma (4.10). And Lemma (4.11) implies that the lifting
↑ω ¯∂u is an element of h′(X; D). Therefore, there exists a one-one
correspondence between h′(X; D) and the kernel of D under the action
gradg, and the reductivity follows since D is a real operator.

On the other hand, ˜γ = Y − ↑ω ¯∂u is in the space h(X; D). Hence

we have

on X. Moreover, we have

∇¯ν ˜γα = ∂¯ν ˜γα = 0,

∇µ˜γα = (↑ ∂γ)α

µ = 0,

on X − D, since γ is a conjugate holomorphic (0, 1) form on X − D.
Therefore, ˜γ is in the space a(X; D), and we have the decomposition

Y = ˜γ+ ↑ω ¯∂u.

Moreover, we claim the following communication relations

(4.25)

(4.26)

[a(X; D), a(X; D)] = {0},

[h(X; D), h(X; D)] ⊂ h′(X; D).

Equation (4.25) is easy. For equation (4.26), consider two elements
Y1, Y2 ∈ h(X; D) and their respective decomposition
Y2 = ˜γ2+ ↑ω ¯∂u2.

Y1 = ˜γ1+ ↑ω ¯∂u1,

Then outside of the divisor D, the holomorphic vector ﬁeld Z := [X, Y ]
tangential to D can be expressed by

where the function

Z =↑ω ¯∂ϕ,

ϕ := Y µ

1 ∂µu1 − Y µ

2 ∂µu1

is of class C,α,β. And it satisﬁes the following Laplacian equation

ϑ(↓ Z) = ∆ωϕ,

on X − D. Thanks to Proposition (4.2) and (4.3), we conclude that
ϕ ∈ C4,α,β is in the kernel of D. Then our claim follows, and this
complete the proof of Theorem (4.1).

4.3. Further remarks. Based on the convexity of conic Mabuchi’s
functional [14], the remaining task is to deform a conic cscK metric to
twisted cscK metrics from the bifurcation technique [9]. In order to do
this, a linear theory is established for the 4th. order elliptic operator
D in the conic setting [16].

Then it is natural to prove that the Lichnerowicz operator D :
C4,α,β → C,α,β has a countable, discrete spectrum Λ ⊂ R+ ∪ {0}. More-
over, it is expected that the ﬁrst eigenvalue λ1 of D is strictly positive.
And this is done by invoking the standard elliptic theorems in the conic
setting [10].

On the other hand, it is interesting to ask the reducitivity when the
cone angle is larger than π. There are several diﬃculties in this case.
First, even if the Ricci tensors are cone admissible, the growth rate of
the Riemannian curvatures are not expected to be, since Brendle’s trick
fails here. Second, if the metric has no model growth in the 3rd. order,
then the integration by parts formula for the Lichnerowicz operator D
is unlikely to be true, Therefore, a new technique from Several Complex
Variables will be utilized to investigate this case as we did in [15].

5. Fundamentals of C4,α,β space

We are going to give some fundamental facts about the space C4,α,β
in this section. Recall that a C4,α,β function u is deﬁned by the equation

(5.1)

∆Ω0u ∈ C2,α,β

for any u ∈ C2,α,β. We claim that this relation is independent of holo-
morphic coordinate charts, and then we can introduce a (complete)
norm to make it as a H¨older space.

For simplicity of demonstration, we assume n = 2 in this section.
The general case follows by a similar argument. Let p be a point
on the divisor D, and U, V are two coordinate charts such that p ∈
U ∩ V . Suppose (ζ, z) is a holomorphic coordinate system on U such
that the divisor is deﬁned by {ζ = 0} in U, and (ζ ′, w) is a holomorphic
coordinate system on V such that D ∩ V := {ζ ′ = 0}. Then we can
write a biholomorphic map

F (ζ ′, z) := {ζ(ζ ′, w), z(ζ ′, w)}

such that ζ ′ = ζ · f (ζ, z) for some everywhere non-zero holomorphic
function f near p. Similar, we have ζ = ζ ′ · g, where g = f −1(ζ ′, w).

5.1. Well deﬁned. The local model metrics in these two charts are
deﬁned by

Ω0 = β2|ζ|2β−2idζ ∧ d¯ζ + idz ∧ d¯z

on U, and

0 = β2|ζ ′|2β−2idζ ′ ∧ d¯ζ ′ + idw ∧ d ¯w.

0u ∈ C2,α,β are

Note that we have

|ζ|2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζu ∈ C2,α,β,

∂z∂¯zu ∈ C2,α,β

by the local deﬁnition of C4,α,β. Hence the term |ζ ′|2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζu is of
class C2,α,β by the equivalence between ζ and ζ ′. Moreover, the term

REMARK

|ζ|2−2β∂z∂¯zu is also of class C2,α,β since |ζ|2−2β is thanks to the small
angle condition. Then the Proposition follows from Lemma (2.16). (cid:3)

5.2. Functional spaces. According to Donaldson [11], we are going
to investigate the norms for the conic H¨older spaces.
In fact, it is
enough to consider these H¨older norms near the divisor D.

Let p be a point on the divisor D, and U be a holomorphic coordinate

centered at p such that the divisor D is locally deﬁned by {ζ = 0}.

Put B1 as the unit ball in U centered at p. For any real valued

function u ∈ C,α,β, its H¨older norm on B1 is introduced as

||u||C,α,β(B1) = sup
B1

|u| + [˜u]Cα(B1),

where

˜u(|ζ|β−1ζ, z2, · · · , zn) := u(ζ, z2, · · · , zn).

If u is of class C1,α,β and compactly supported in B1, then its H¨older
norm is deﬁned as

||u||C 1,α,β(B1) = |˜u|C 1(B1) + [D˜u]C,α(B1).

Note that locally this norm is equivalent to

||ρ1−β∂ζu||C,α,β(B1) +Xk>1

||∂ku||C,α,β(B1),

since we have

|ζ|1−β∂¯ζu(ζ, z2, · · · , zn) =

β − 1

2

∂¯ξ ˜u(ξ, z2, · · · , zn)

ζ 2
|ζ|2 ∂ξ ˜u(ξ, z2, · · · , zn).

Moreover, locally the norm for the H¨older space C2,α,β is deﬁned by

||∂k∂iu||C,α,β + Xk,l>1

||∂k∂¯lu||C,α,β +Xk>1

||u||C 2,α,β = Xk,i>1
+ Xk>1

(5.7)

||ρ1−β∂k∂ζ u||C,α,β

||ρ1−β∂k∂¯ζu||C,α,β + ||ρ2−2β∂ζ∂¯ζu||C,α,β

Note that we are lack of directions ∂ζ ∂ζu and ∂¯ζ∂¯ζ u in the norm of
C2,α,β. However, the space C2,α,β is still a Banach space equipped with
this norm. For the convenience of the reader, we present a proof here.

Lemma 5.2. The space C2,α,β is a Banach space.

Proof. Suppose {ui} is a Cauchy sequence in the space C2,α,β, and then
the following sequence

fi := ∆Ω0ui ∈ C,α,β

30

LONG LI AND KAI ZHENG

forms a Cauchy sequence under the norm || · ||C,α,β (we can always
assume f is compactly supported near a point on the divisor by mul-
tiplying a cut oﬀ function to u). Therefore, there exists a function
f∞ ∈ C,α,β such that we have the convergence

(5.8)

||fi − f∞||C,α,β → 0.

On the other hand, there exists a function u∞ ∈ C1,α,β which is the
limit of ui

||ui − u∞||C 1,α,β → 0.

It is enough to prove that u∞ is of class C2,α,β. Let Σ be a relative
compact domain outside of the divisor D, and then all functions ui are
in the class C 2,α′(Σ) for some α′ > 0, by interior estimates (Lemma
6.16, [13]). Moreover, the sequence ui converges in C 2,α′(Σ) thanks
to interior Schauder estimate. Note that this limit is nothing but u∞
outside of the divisor. Hence we have

(5.9)

∆Ω0u∞ = f∞

on X−D, and the result follows from Donaldson’s estimates (see Propo-
sition 2.1 and 2.2, [1]).
(cid:3)

Now consider the space C4,α,β, and we can introduce the following

norms locally on each holomorphic coordinate

(5.10)

where

||u||C 4,α,β := ||u||C 2,α,β + ||v||C 2,α,β

v := ∆Ω0u.

In order to obtain a norm space globally, choose a locally ﬁnite cov-
ering and a partition of unity subordinated to it. And we can glue
the local norms together by this partition of unity. In prior, the global
norm || · ||C 4,α,β depends on the chosen holomorphic coordinate charts
and partition of unity. However, these norms are all equivalent. This
is because all smooth functions are of class C4,α,β under small angle
condition. Then the computation in Proposition (5.1) together with
Donaldson’s Schauder estimate (Proposition 2.2 [1]) and Brendle’s trick
(see Appendix) imply that there exists a constant C such that

C −1||∆Ω′

0u||C 2,α,β ≤ ||∆Ω0u||C 2,α,β ≤ C||∆Ω′

0u||C 2,α,β ,

for Ω0 and Ω′

0 on two diﬀerent holomorphic coordinate charts.

Lemma 5.3. The space C4,α,β is a Banach space equipped with this
norm || · ||C 4,α,β .

Proof. We can again argue it in a small open neighborhood U of a
point on the divisor. Suppose {ui} is a Cauchy sequence under the
norm || · ||C 4,α,β , and then {vi} also forms a Cauchy sequence in the

Banach space C2,α,β. Therefore, there exists a function v∞ ∈ C2,α,β
such that it is the limit

On the other hand, there exist a limit u∞ ∈ C2,α,β of ui

||vi − v∞||C 2,α,β → 0.

||ui − u∞||C 2,α,β → 0.

Then it is enough to prove u∞ ∈ C4,α,β. Now for any point q which is
close but NOT on the divisor, we claim that ∆Ω0u∞ is of class C 2,α′
and it satisﬁes

in C 2,α′ near q for some α′ > 0.

∆Ω0ui → ∆Ω0u∞,

Suppose the distance between q ∈ U and the divisor D is larger than
1 but less than 2. Then we can consider a holomorphic coordinate ball
B1(q) centered at q, and introduce a cut-oﬀ function χ which equals to
1 on B1/2(q) but compactly supported in B1(q). Note that the value
of the functions ui and ∆Ω0ui are unchanged in the ball B1/2(q) if we
replace ui by χui. Hence we can assume the functions ui and vi is
compactly supported in B1(q) for each i. Moreover, their limits u∞
and v∞ are also compactly supported in this ball.

Now the sequence vi converges in C 2,α′(B1(q)) to a limit v ∈ C 2,α′(B1(q)),

and then we can solve the Dirichlet problem on B1(q) with trivial
boundary condition as

(5.11)

∆Ω0u = v.

But note that the limit v can be nothing but v∞, and then u is exactly
u∞ by the uniqueness of Dirichlet problem, and the claim follows.

Therefore, we have the equation

∆2

Ω0u∞ = ∆Ω0v∞ ∈ C,α,β,

pointwise outside of the divisor. This implies that ∆Ω0u∞ is of class
C2,α,β, and the result follows from Donaldson’s Schauder estimate.

6. Appendix

For the convenience of the reader, we present details of Brendle’s
trick [1] in this section. Let D := B1(0) be the holomorphic unit disk
in C, and D∗ be the punctured disk. Suppose w is a uniformly bounded
smooth function on D∗, and h is a H¨older continuous function on D
such that

h(z) := |z|2β−2f (|z|β−1z),

for some C α continuous function f deﬁned on D with f (0) = 0. Hence
we have

|h(z)| ≤ [ ˜f ]Cα|z|2β−2+αβ,

32

where αβ < 1 − 2β, and β < 1/2. Put |z| = r, and

(6.1)

F (z) := ∂z∂zw(z) + (1 − β)z−1∂zw(z),

and then we claim the following:

Proposition 6.1. Suppose the function w satisﬁes the following Lapla-
cian equation on D∗:

(6.2)

∂2w
∂z∂ ¯z

= h.

Then we have the following estimate near the origin of D:

|| r2−2βF (z) ||C,α,β ≤ C||f ||C,α,β.

We will demonstrate our proof from step to step.

6.1. Distribution theory. We ﬁrst claim equation (6.2) holds on D
in the sense of distributions. The argument is standard here. Notice
that ∆w − h is a distribution supported at the origin. Hence we can
write it as

∆w − h = X|α|=0

Cα∂αδ,

where |α| is the order of the index α, and only ﬁnite many constants
Cα are non-zero.

Next we are going to prove by contradiction. Suppose there is a
constant Cα which is not zero. Deﬁne the following ﬁnite set of indexes.

A := {l ≥ 0 | Cα 6= 0 for some |α| = l}.

Take χ to be a smooth testing function compactly supported on D,
such that

for each l ∈ A. Let χk = χ(kz), and consider the following actions.

Cα∂αχ(0) 6= 0

X|α|=l
hχk =Z|z|<1/k

hχ(kz) ≤Z|z|<1/k

|h|,

h(φk) =ZD

and it converges to zero since h ∈ L1. On the other hand, we have
another action.

where the index m is the maximum element in A. Hence this action
diverges to inﬁnity when k → +∞, which is a contradiction to our
previous boundedness result.

6.2. interior estimate. For simplicity, we view w as a bounded func-
tion on the punctured disk with radius 2. Pick up an arbitrary point z0
in D∗, and let r0 = ε|z0|, for some ε < 1/2. Consider the ball Br0(z0)
centered at z0 with radius r0, we can deﬁne the following function on
the open ball B1(0).

Thanks to the local Schauder estimates, we have

v(z) := w(z0 + r0z).

(6.3)

||∇v||C 0(B1/2) ≤ ||v||C 2,α(B1/2) ≤ C(||∆v||C,α(B1) + ||v||C 0(B1)).

The change of variables after rescaling implies the following equations:

(6.4)

and

[r2

[∆v]C,α(B1).

On the other side,

||∇v||C 0(B1/2) = r0||∇w||C 0(Br0 (z0)).
Combining above inequalities, we have for r0 small

|∇w|(z0) ≤ ||∇w||C 0(Br0 (z0))

The last inequality follows from the the estimate

||h||C,α(Br0 (z0)) = O(r2β+αβ−1

when ε is small. And it can be proved by the following lemma.

Lemma 6.2. Let r0 = ε|z0|. When ε is small enough, for all z1, z2 ∈
Br0(z0), we have

(6.7)

||z1|β−1z1 − |z2|β−1z2| ≤ C(ε)rβ−1

0

|z1 − z2|

Proof. Let z1 = r1, z2 = r2eiθ, and assume r2 < r1. Suppose θ = 0 ﬁrst.
Then equation (6.7) follows from the H¨older continuity of the function
rβ.

where θrβ

lent to the line segment |z1 − z2|. That is to say, there exists a uniform
bounded function K(θ) =

2 sin(θ/2) , such that

(cid:3)

In fact, these two distance functions are equivalent to each other in

the ball Br0(z0)

Lemma 6.3. For any ε small enough, and z1, z2 ∈ Br0(z0), there exists
a constant c(ε) such that

(6.10)

||z1|β−1z1 − |z2|β−1z2| ≥ c(ε)rβ−1

0

|z1 − z2|

Proof. Again we can assume r2 < r1 and z0 = z1. When θ = 0, the
inequality follows from the mean value equation

Moreover, we have

Hence we can discuss case by case. First if |r1 − r2| ≥ θr2, then we
have

6.3. W 1,2 estimate and H¨older continuity. Let’s compute the L2
norm of ∇w as follows.

|∇w|2 =ZB1−Bε

wh∇w, ˆri −Z∂Bε

The ﬁrst two terms in above equation are uniformly bounded. And the
third term can be estimated by

Z∂Bε

wh∇w, ˆri ≤ CZ∂Bε

|∇w| ≤Z|z|=ε

r−1 < K,

for some uniform constant K. This implies that ∇w is in L2(D∗). Then
we can say there exists an L2(D) function g (vector valued) such that
∇w = g on D. In other words, w is the weak solution of the Laplacian
equation. Then the Lp regularity estimate implies w ∈ W 2,p for some
1 < p < 2 (w ∈ W 1,1 is enough!). And the Sobolev embedding implies
that w ∈ C α′ around the origin.

6.4. Cauchy’s integral formula. Let’s apply the Cauchy integral
formula to the punctured ball Ω = B1\Bε.

The second term is uniformly bounded. And we claim the third term
converges to zero as ε does. First, we can assume w(0) = 0 after
adjusting a constant to it. Then |w(z)| ≤ C|z|α′ for some small α′.
Now inequality (6.6) actually implies the follows.

for all z ∈ B1/4.

Now put v(z) = w(z0 + r0z) again, and use the Schauder estimate

for ¯∂ operator (acting on functions)

(6.17)

|∂z∂zv|(0) ≤ ||∂zv||C 1,α(B1/2) ≤ C(||∆v||C,α(B1) + ||v||C 0(B1)).

This implies

(6.19)

|z|2−2β(∂z∂zw + (1 − β)z−1w) ≤ C[ ˜f ]C,α|z|αβ.

6.5. Outside the origin. Take ξ := |z|β−1z, and the H¨older distance
function in the so called w-coordinate is denoted by

d(z0, z1) :=

|F (ξ0) − F (ξ1)|

|ξ0 − ξ1|α

.

We have seen the estimate for d(z0, 0) from equation (6.19), and then
it is enough to consider the case when z0 and z1 are comparable, in
the sense that z1 is always in the ball Br0(z0). ( If z0 and z1 are not
comparable, then the estimate follows from the continuity of the H¨older
distance function and triangle inequality. )

Proof of Proposition (6.1). Combine inequality (6.19) and (6.24), and
