FRACTIONAL FICK’S LAW FOR THE BOUNDARY DRIVEN

EXCLUSION PROCESS WITH LONG JUMPS

C.BERNARDIN AND B.JIMENEZ OVIEDO

Abstract. A fractional Fick’s law and fractional hydrostatics for the one di-
mensional exclusion process with long jumps in contact with inﬁnite reservoirs
at diﬀerent densities on the left and on the right are derived.

1. Introduction

The exclusion process is known as the “Ising model” of non-equilibrium statisti-
cal mechanics and since its introduction in the 70’s in biophysics by MacDonald et
al. ([25, 26]) and in probability by Spitzer [29], a lot of papers in the mathemat-
ical physics literature focused on it because it captures the main features of more
realistic diﬀusive systems driven out of equilibrium ([23], [24], [30]). The exclusion
process is an interacting particle system consisting of a collection of continuous-
time dependent random walks moving on the lattice Z: A particle at x waits an
exponential time and then chooses to jump to x + y with probability p(y). If, how-
ever, x + y is already occupied, the jump is suppressed and the clock is reset. In
this paper we are interested in the case where p(·) has a long tail, proportional to
| · |−(1+γ) for γ > 0. Curiously it is only very recently that the investigation of the
exclusion process with long jumps started ([4, 14, 15, 13, 28, 32]).
Our motivation for this study is threefold. First, due to the intense activity
developed around the exclusion process since its introduction almost ﬁfty years
ago, it is very natural to investigate on the diﬀerences and the similarities between
the ﬁnite jumps exclusion process and the long jumps exclusion process. Our second
motivation is related to the ﬁeld of anomalous diﬀusion in one dimensional chains
of oscillators ([9, 21, 31]). Recent studies suggest that the macroscopic behavior
of some chains of oscillators (with short range interactions) displaying anomalous
diﬀusion should be similar to the macroscopic behavior of the symmetric exclusion
process with long jumps. In order to motivate this claim, let us observe that the
equilibrium ﬂuctuations of a harmonic chain with energy-momentum conservative
noise and of the long jumps exclusion process with exponent γ = 3/2 are the same
([14, 15, 2, 3, 16]). See also Remark 2.2 of this paper for a second example. These
similarities can be roughly understood by the fact that in 1d chains of oscillators, the
energy carriers, the phonons, do not behave like interacting Brownian particles but
like interacting Levy walks ([11, 10] and [8] for a review on Levy walks). Therefore,
we believe that the symmetric exclusion process with long jumps could play the
role of a simple eﬀective model to investigate properties of superdiﬀusive chains
of oscillators. Our third motivation, which is related to the second but has also

its own interest, is to develop a macroscopic ﬂuctuation theory for superdiﬀusive
systems (e.g. exclusion process with long jumps) as it has been done during the
([5]) for diﬀusive systems. The key idea behind
last decade by Bertini et al.
the macroscopic ﬂuctuation theory is that the non-equilibrium free energy of a
particular given system depends only on its macroscopic behavior and not on its
microscopic details. Therefore, two models macroscopically identical shall have
the same non-equilibrium free energie. As explained above our hope is that some
superdiﬀusive chains of oscillators and exclusion processes with long jumps have
the same macroscopic behavior and hence the same non-equilibrium free energy.

In this paper we consider the symmetric exclusion process with long jumps in
contact with two reservoirs with diﬀerent densities at the boundaries. We show that
in the non-equilibrium stationary state the average density current scales with the
length N of the system as N −δ, 0 < δ < 1. We also show that the stationary density
proﬁle is described by the stationary solution of a fractional diﬀusion equation with
Dirichlet boundary conditions. Observe that in a diﬀusive regime, δ = 1 and that
the stationary proﬁle is the stationary solution of a usual diﬀusion equation with
Dirichlet boundary conditions. Similar conclusions to ours, as well as extensions
to the asymmetric case, have been obtained in a non-rigorous physics paper by
J. Szavits-Nossan and K. Uzelac ([32]). As a ﬁnal remark of this introduction let
us observe that in our paper, as well as in [32], the reservoirs are described by
inﬁnite reservoirs. This has the advantage to avoid a truncation of the long range
transition probability p(·). However other reservoirs descriptions are possible but
we conjecture that they could have a quantitative eﬀect of the form of the stationary
proﬁle. Indeed, since the fractional Laplacian is a non-local operator, the fractional
Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions can be interpreted in several ways
giving rise to diﬀerent stationary solutions. The (microscopic) description used for
the reservoirs ﬁx the (macroscopic) interpretation of the fractional Laplacian with
Dirichlet boundary conditions. In our case it is the so called “restricted fractional
Laplacian” which appears. This sensitivity to the form of the reservoirs is due to
the presence of long jumps and does not appear for the exclusion process with short
jumps. This sensitivity has also been observed in models of (non interacting) Levy
walks and in the context of 1d superdiﬀusive chains of oscillators ([22]).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe precisely the model
studied and the results obtained. In Section 3 we recall basic facts on the fractional
Laplacian and explain what we mean by stationary solution of a fractional diﬀusion
equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Section 4 is devoted to the proofs of
the results with some technical lemmata postponed to the Appendix.

2. Model and Results

We consider a symmetric long jumps exclusion process on ΛN = {1, . . . , N − 1},
N ≥ 2, in contact with two reservoirs at density α ∈ (0, 1) on the left and density
β ∈ (0, 1) on the right. Let p(·) be a probability function on Z which takes the form

p(z) =

cγ

|z|1+γ,

|z| ≥ 1,

p(0) = 0,

where 2 > γ > 1 and cγ > 0 is a normalization factor. If γ ≥ 2 the boundary driven
long jumps symmetric exclusion process has mutatis mutandis the same behavior

FRACTIONAL FICK’S LAW

as the usual boundary driven ﬁnite jumps exclusion process 1. The conﬁguration
space of the process is ΩN = {0, 1}ΛN and a typical conﬁguration η is denoted
as a sequence (ηz)z indexed by z ∈ ΛN . The generator of the boundary driven
symmetric long jumps exclusion process {η(t) ; t ≥ 0} is deﬁned by

(2.2)

p(x − y)[ηx(1 − α) + (1 − ηx)α][f (ηx) − f (η)].

Here the conﬁgurations ηx and ηxy are deﬁned by

ηz, z 6= x, y,
ηy, z = x,
ηx, z = y

,

(ηx)z =(ηz, z 6= x,

1 − ηx, z = x.

(ηxy)z =


Sometimes it will be useful to consider a conﬁguration η ∈ ΩN as a conﬁguration
on {0, 1, α, β}Z by extending η by setting ηx = α for x ≤ 0 and ηx = β for x ≥ N .
Observe that the reservoirs add and remove particles on all the sites of the lattice
ΛN , and not only at the boundaries, but with rates which decrease as the distance
from the corresponding reservoir increases. The same kind of reservoirs is used in
[32].

The bulk dynamics (i.e. without the presence of the reservoirs) conserves the

number of particles. Let Wx, x = 1, . . . N , be deﬁned by

Wx = Xy≤x−1Xz≥x

p(z − y)[ηy − ηz],

1 ≤ x ≤ N.

(2.3)

In this formula, as explained above, we adopted the convention ηz = α for z ≤ 0
and ηz = β for z ≥ N . It can be checked that since γ > 1, these quantities are
well deﬁned. Then for any x ∈ ΛN we have the following microscopic continuity
equation

LN ηx = −∇Wx := −(Wx+1 − Wx).

(2.4)

Let us denote by µN the unique invariant measure of {η(t) ; t ≥ 0}. If α = β = ρ
then µN is equal to the Bernoulli product measure with density ρ. It is denoted
by νρ. The expectation of a function f with respect to µN (resp. νρ) is denoted
by hfiN (resp. hfiρ) or µN (f ) (resp. νρ(f )). For any ρ ∈ (0, 1) the density of µN
with respect to νρ is denoted by fN,ρ.

1For γ = 2 the diﬀusive scaling has to be replaced by a diﬀusive scaling with some logarithmic
corrections but the system behaves macroscopically in a diﬀusive way.

constant equal to Cγ = Γ(1/2)π−3/2 sin(πγ/2). It can be shown that the function
¯ρ is smooth in the bulk but only γ/2-H¨older at the boundaries.

Our ﬁrst result is the hydrostatic behavior for the boundary driven exclusion

process with long jumps, stated in the following theorem.
Theorem 2.1. Let γ ∈ (1, 2). For any continuous function H : [0, 1] → R we have
that

Remark 2.2. In [1] and [27], a harmonic chain with energy-momentum conser-
vative noise in contact with thermal baths at diﬀerent temperatures is considered
and it is shown that the temperature proﬁle is given by the solution of a fractional
heat equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
In these papers the baths are
of Langevin type and the fractional Laplacian which appears is not the “restricted
fractional Laplacian” like in our work but some “spectral fractional Laplacian”.
We conjecture that if Langevin baths are replaced by inﬁnite thermal baths then the
macroscopic behavior is described by the “restricted fractional Laplacian”.

Our second result is the following “fractional Fick’s law”.

Theorem 2.3. Let γ ∈ (1, 2) then the following fractional Fick’s law holds 2

where ¯ρ : R → [0, 1] is the unique solution of (2.5) and x is arbitrary in (0, 1).

Observe that the current is a non-local function of the density.

2The RHS of (2.7) does not depend on x. It can be proved by taking the derivative w.r.t. x of
the RHS of (2.7) and showing it vanishes thanks to (2.5).

tions H : R → R such that

(3.3)

provided the limit exists (which is the case if H is β-H¨older for some β > γ and
satisﬁes (3.1), e.g. if H is in the Schwartz space). Up to a multiplicative constant,
−(−∆)γ/2 is the generator of a γ-Levy stable process. The fractional Laplacian
can also be deﬁned in an equivalent way as a pseudo-diﬀerential operator of symbol
|ξ|γ (up to a multiplicative constant).
We are interested in the boundary problem (2.5) which has to be suitably inter-
preted since the fractional Laplacian is not a local operator. The correct interpre-
tation of (2.5) which appears in this paper is that ¯ρ is the restriction to [0, 1] of a
function u : R → R such that

(−∆)γ/2 u(q) = 0,
u(q) = α,
q ≤ 0,
q ≥ 1.
u(q) = β,

q ∈ (0, 1),




In the PDE’s literature this interpretation corresponds to the so-called “restricted
fractional Laplacian”. An another popular interpretation of the fractional Lapla-
cian with Dirichlet boundary conditions is the “spectral fractional Laplacian” ([33]).
The interpretation appearing in [1] is a third one.

Let the functions r± : (0, 1) → (0,∞) be deﬁned by

r−(q) = cγγ−1q−γ,

The operator L is deﬁned by its action on functions H ∈ C2
functions with compact suport included in (0, 1), by

r+(q) = cγγ−1(1 − q)−γ

(3.4)
c ([0, 1]), the space of C2

∀q ∈ (0, 1),

(LH)(q) = −(−∆)γ/2H (q) + r−(q)H(q) + r+(q)H(q).

(3.5)
Deﬁnition 3.1. We say that a continuous function ρ : [0, 1] → [0, 1] is a weak
solution of (2.5) if ρ(0) = α, ρ(1) = β and for any smooth function H ∈ C2
c ([0, 1])
we have that

−hρ , (−∆)γ/2Hi + h αr− + βr+ , Hi = 0

where h·,·i denotes the usual scalar product in L2([0, 1]).
Proposition 3.2. There exists a unique weak solution to (2.5). It is given by (2.6).

Proof. The existence of a continuous (explicit) solution given by (2.6) and satisfying
(3.3) is a well known fact (see e.g. [6]). Let us it denote by ρ and let us show it is
also a weak solution. For any H ∈ C2

c ([0, 1]) we have

hρ , LHi + hα − ρ , Hr−i + hβ − ρ , Hr+i
= −Z ∞

ρ(q)(−∆)γ/2H(q) dq.

−∞

6

ρ(q)(−∆)γ/2H(q) dq =Z ∞
H(q)(−∆)γ/2ρ(q) dq = 0.

H(q)(−∆)γ/2ρ(q) dq

Let us now turn to the uniqueness part. Let ρ1 and ρ2 be two weak solutions. We
extend them continuously to R by ρ1(y) = ρ2(y) = α if y ≤ 0 and ρ1(y) = ρ2(y) = β
if y ≥ 1. By linearity we have that for any H ∈ C2

c ([0, 1])

hρ1 − ρ2, (−∆)γ/2Hi = 0.

Since ρ1 − ρ2 = 0 outside (0, 1), h·,·i may be replaced by the scalar product in
L2(R). By using Theorem 3.12 in [6] we deduce that ρ1 = ρ2.

For any continuous function F : [0, 1] → R we denote by LN F the continuous
function on [0, 1] obtained as the linear interpolation of the function deﬁned by
(LN F )(0) = (LN F )(1) = 0 and

∀x ∈ ΛN ,

sponding integrals. But since the uniformity statement requires a bit of technical
work it is postponed to Appendix B.

4. Proofs

The ﬁrst step consists to obtain a sharp upper bound on the average current
in the non-equilibrium stationary state (see Lemma 4.1). This bound will be used
to derive an estimate of the entropy production (Lemma 4.2) which is the key
estimate to obtain by a coarse graining argument and entropy bounds that the
empirical density at each extremity of ΛN is given by α and β (Corollary 4.4). To
identify the form of the stationary proﬁle in the bulk, we use a method introduced
in [19] for boundary driven diﬀusive systems (Lemma 4.6). Fractional Fick’s law is
then derived.

4.1. Entropy production bounds.
Lemma 4.1. Let γ ∈ (1, 2). There exists a constant C > 0 such that for any
N ≥ 2

hW1iN ≤ CN 1−γ.

that

p(x − y)hfN (η)ηx(1 − β) [log fN (ηx) − log fN (η)]iρ

This gives the ﬁrst inequality in Lemma 4.2 since the left hand side of the previous

PN be the law on M+
2 when ΩN
is equipped with the non-equilibrium stationary state µN . To simplify notations,
we denote πN (η) (resp. ˆπN (η)) by πN (resp. ˆπN ) and the action of π ∈ M+
d on a
continuous function H : [0, 1]d → R by hπ, Hi =R[0,1]d H(u)π(du).
The sequence (PN )N ≥2 is tight on M+

of probabilities over the compact set M+

concentrated on the set of measures (ˆπ, π) of M+
1 × M+
2 such that π (resp. ˆπ) is
absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on [0, 1] (resp. [0, 1]2)
and with a density ρ(u) (resp. ρ(u)ρ(v)) where ρ is a weak solution of (2.5).

Lemma 4.3. Let P∗ be a cluster point of (PN )N . Then P∗ is concentrated on mea-
sures (ˆπ, π) such that π (resp. ˆπ) is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue
[0, 1]2). The density ρ of π is a continuous function on
measure on [0, 1] (resp.
[0, 1] and the density of ˆπ is equal to ρ ⊗ ρ : (x, y) ∈ [0, 1]2 → ρ(x)ρ(y).
Proof. See Appendix C.

(cid:3)

With some abuse of notation we denote by (PN )N a ﬁxed subsequence converging
to a cluster point P∗. A generic element of M+
2 is denoted by (π, ˆπ) with
the convention that π and ˆπ = π ⊗ π denotes the probability measure as well as its
density with respect to the Lebesgue measure.

Proposition 4.4. We have that P∗ almost surely π(0) = α and π(1) = β.

Proof. For small ε > 0 and small λ ∈ R, let B be the box B := {[N ε], . . . , N} and
let u be the function deﬁned by

u = eλ Px∈B ηx.

Remark 4.5. The usual proof for driven diﬀusive systems of this proposition is
quite diﬀerent and based on the so-called two-blocks estimate ([12], [20]). It turns
out that in the context of exclusion process with long jumps this approach does not
work since the control of the entropy production is not suﬃcient to cancel the heavy
tails of p, even by using the arguments of [14].

Lemma 4.6. Let ¯ρ be the unique weak solution of (2.5). For any F, G in C∞
we have

to 0 on the diagonal. Consider a small δ > 0 and take a smooth even function
Hδ : R → [0, 1] which is equal to 0 on [−δ, δ] and equal to 1 outside of [−2δ, 2δ].
Let then Jδ(u, v) = F (u)G(v)Hδ(v − u), (u, v) ∈ [0, 1]2.

For u ∈ [0, 1] we denote by Fδ,u, Gδ,u the functions given by

Since P∗ almost surely π(0) = ¯ρ(0) = α and π(1) = ¯ρ(1) = β and that π − ¯ρ
are continuous functions, by extending then to R by π(x) = ¯ρ(x) = α if x ≤ 0 and
π(x) = ¯ρ(x) = β if x ≥ 1, we get that for any F, G in C∞

Lebesgue measure on [0, 1]2. Since by Corollary 4.4, we have I(0, 0) = I(1, 1) = 0,
we deduce that I is identically equal to 0. Thus P∗ almost surely π = ¯ρ.

Appendix C. Proof of Lemma 4.3

The fact that P∗ is concentrated on absolutely continuous measures is obvious

since for any continuous function H : [0, 1] → R we have

|hπN , Hi| ≤

1

(N − 1)

N −1

Xx=1

|H(x/N )|

and similarly for ˆπN . Since for any continuous function H, the functional π ∈
M+
d → hπ, Hi is continuous, by weak convergence, we have that P∗ is concentrated
on measures (π, ˆπ) such that for any continuous function H, ˆH

|hπ, Hi| ≤Z[0,1] |H(u)|du,

|hˆπ, ˆHi| ≤Z[0,1]2 | ˆH(u, v)|dudv

which implies that such a π and ˆπ are absolutely continuous with respect to the
Lebesgue measure. The densities are denoted by π and ˆπ. Since ˆπN is a product
measure whose marginals are given by πN , by weak convergence, we have that
ˆπ(u, v) = π(u)π(v) for any (u, v) ∈ [0, 1]2.
