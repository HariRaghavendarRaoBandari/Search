The high-temperature ferromagnet MnBi continues to receive attention as a candidate to replace rare-earth-
containing permanent magnets in applications above room temperature. This is due to a high Curie tem-
perature, large magnetic moments, and a coercivity that increases with temperature. The synthesis of MnBi
also allows for crystals that are free of interstitial Mn, enabling more direct access to the key interactions
underlying the physical properties of binary Mn-based ferromagnets. In this work, we use inelastic neutron
scattering to measure the spin waves of MnBi in order to characterize the magnetic exchange at low temper-
ature. Consistent with the spin reorientation that occurs below 140 K, we do not observe a spin gap in this
system above our experimental resolution. A Heisenberg model was ﬁt to the spin wave data in order to char-
acterize the long-range nature of the exchange. It was found that interactions up to sixth nearest neighbor are
required to fully parameterize the spin waves. Surprisingly, the nearest-neighbor term is antiferromagnetic,
and the realization of a ferromagnetic ground state relies on the more numerous ferromagnetic terms beyond
nearest neighbor, suggesting that the ferromagnetic ground state arises as a consequence of the long-ranged
interactions in the system.

The unusual magnetic properties of MnBi produce
a material that is an attractive candidate as an al-
ternative to rare-earth-containing ferromagnets in ap-
plications at room temperature and above1.
Its high
transition temperature (TC = 630 K) and strong mag-
netic anisotropy2–4 combined with large Mn moments
(3.50(2) µB at 300 K, and 3.90(2) µB at 5 K5) produce
energy products up to 7.7 MGOe4. Of particular inter-
est for applications, MnBi has a magnetic coercivity that
increases from ≈ 1 T at room temperature to ≈ 2.5 T
at 550 K6–8. It also displays favorable magneto-optical
properties such as a large Kerr eﬀect, which may be use-
ful as a magnetic storage medium in thin ﬁlms9,10. For
this reason, there is an ongoing, concerted eﬀort to un-
derstand the growth conditions to optimize its properties
for these applications11.

Despite the recent interest in MnBi, the microscopic
origin of its magnetic properties have not been com-
pletely determined. Above 140 K, the ordered mag-
netic moments lie along the c-axis, but between 140 K
and 90 K the spins undergo a continuous rotation away
from the c-axis so that below 90 K the spins lie in
the ab-plane4. This transition has been identiﬁed as
a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition driven
by magnetostriction5.
It has been suggested that the
Bi atoms play an important role in driving this spin-

reorientation, as the Bi-Bi exchange interactions have
been proposed as an origin of the observed anisotropic
thermal expansion5. Local spin density approximation
(LSDA) calculations suggest that the spin reorientation
occurs due to an inversion of the orbital momentum min-
imum on the Bi atom12, while a tight-binding atomic-
sphere-approximation (ASA) model predicts a small, an-
tiparallel moment on the Bi atom, which undergoes a
simultaneous spin reorientation4.

The loss of magnetic order above 630 K is not a typi-
cal magnetic transition, but occurs instead due to a de-
composition of MnBi into Mn1.08Bi and elemental Bi13,
both paramagnetic at this temperature. The product
Mn1.08Bi has excess Mn, where the excess Mn atoms oc-
cupy 8% of the interstitial vacancies present in MnBi6.
The relative proximity to the eutectic point (535 K)
makes the synthesis diﬃcult, which is why most prior
work has been performed on samples that are Mn1.08Bi
and/or polycrystalline3,4,8. Due to coupling of the mag-
netism with the structural decomposition, it has been
found that application of a 10 T magnetic ﬁeld can sta-
bilize the MnBi phase up to 650 K14–16. By cooling the
melt in a magnetic ﬁeld, MnBi crystallites can be ob-
tained, as described elsewhere5,15,17. Other isostructural
Mn-based ferromagnets, such as MnSb18, cannot be syn-
thesized in this manner and so they contain some degree
of interstitial Mn. Thus, studying the interstitial-free
MnBi presents the opportunity to understand the mag-
netism and electronic correlations in the most fundamen-

tal form – coincidentally, the member of this family with
the highest TC and largest energy product4.

In this work, we use neutron scattering on a single
crystal of MnBi that is free of interstitial Mn in order
to measure the spin waves at low temperature. These
measurements permit us to quantitatively determine the
exchange interactions in this system, characterizing the
degree of extended exchange that is present. Comparing
this to other Mn-based binary magnets demonstrates the
role that the long-ranged interactions play in the mag-
netic properties of this class of materials.

MnBi crystallizes in the hexagonal NiAs-type structure
(space group P63/mmc), with the Bi atoms occupying
half of the interstitial sites3,4. For this study, single crys-
tals of MnBi were grown from a ﬂux utilizing excess Bi,
as described elsewhere5. The crystals have been charac-
terized using powder and single-crystal x-ray diﬀraction
measurements, whose reﬁnements gave a nominal com-
position of Mn1.01(1)Bi, where excess Mn atoms occupy
interstitial sites5. This can be seen in Fig. 1, where the
open circles denote the interstitial positions that can be
partially ﬁlled by the excess Mn atoms.
For the neutron scattering measurements, a single crys-
tal of mass 1.989 g and a mosaic of 0.41◦ was rotated over
a 90◦ range in 1◦ steps about a vertical axis, with the
[H 0 L] plane horizontal. The measurements were per-
formed on the Wide Angular-Range Chopper Spectrom-
eter (ARCS) at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS)19
using incident neutron energies of 80 meV and 150 meV,
giving an energy resolution of 3.2 and 6 meV, respec-
tively, at the elastic line. The sample was measured in
a closed-cycle refrigerator at temperatures of 5 K and
200 K.

The measured magnetic Bragg peaks at 5 K and 200 K
are consistent with moments directed perpendicular and
parallel to the c-axis, respectively. The 5 K data, which
has reduced phonon scattering due to the Bose factor,
was used to determine the magnetic exchanges in this
system. The upper panels of Fig. 2 show representative
slices through the spin wave spectrum measured on the
ARCS spectrometer at T = 5 K, below the spin reori-
entation, so that the magnetic moments lie within the
ab-plane. The spin waves were measured across multiple
directions in reciprocal space, which allows the exchange
interactions to be quantiﬁed. We see that the spin waves
are well-deﬁned, with no broad, inelastic features present
in the data that would indicate the presence of signiﬁcant
quantities of interstitial Mn, as is observed for the case of
Mn1.13Sb18 (shown in Fig. 2(e)). This is consistent with
the reﬁnement of diﬀraction data that measured 1(1)%
excess Mn in this sample and allows for a simpler de-
termination of the exchange interactions since we do not
have to account for the eﬀects of interstitial Mn on the
magnetic exchange.

To parametrize the spin wave dispersion, the data was
ﬁt to a Heisenberg model. The moment was assumed
to be 3.90 µB on the Mn atoms5, while no moment was
placed on the Bi atoms. This is because the theoreti-

Mn atoms (small, blue) occupy the 2a position, while the Bi
atoms (large, red) occupy the 2c position. The other half
of the interstitial positions (Wyckoﬀ symbol 2d), shown as
open circles, can be occupied by Mn impurities. Charac-
terization measurements of the samples used suggested that
1(1) % of the interstitial sites were so occupied by Mn atoms5.
The spin arrangement shown is for the low-temperature range
(T < 90 K). At all temperatures, MnBi is ferromagnetic, how-
ever above T = 140 K, the spins point atlong the c-axis, while
from T = 140 K to 90 K, the spins rotate away from the c-
axis such that below 90 K the spins lie entirely in the ab-plane.
The exchange parameters (J1 through J6) determined in this
work are shown between the relevant Mn ions.

cal prediction for the size of the Bi moments is two or-
ders of magnitude smaller than the Mn moments, and
any moment on the Bi sites and accompanying Bi-Bi ex-
change interactions would be too weak to be observed
in these measurements4,12.
In order to accurately re-
produce the spin wave measurements, it was necessary
to include interactions up to the 6th nearest neighbor
(J6), corresponding to a distance of 7.462 ˚A. These ex-
change interactions are shown schematically in Fig. 1.
The need to include interactions up to d = 7.5 ˚A indi-
cates the signiﬁcance of relatively long-ranged interac-
tions, likely due to an itinerant nature of the magnetic
exchange. Similarly, other isostructural Mn binary sys-
tems MnP20, MnAs21,22, and MnSb18,23 all have large
Mn moments and all order ferromagnetically at, or near,
ambient pressure. Despite the symmetry-lowering tran-
sition at TSR = 90 K, the high-temperature space group
(NiAs-type) was used for the spin-wave calculations as
previous measurements of the symmetry-lowering distor-
tion indicated that the magnitude of the distortion is
very small, and thus unlikely to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the

being virtually free of interstitial Mn.

magnetic excitation spectrum5. For more details of the
ﬁtting procedure, see the Supplemental Information24.

The magnetic anisotropy present in this system ne-
cessitates a non-zero spin gap. However, the possible
origins of this anisotropy all result in a small gap5,12,
which agrees with the measurements of Fig 2, where
any spin gap is less than the resolution of the data, ap-
proximately 6 meV. Measurements on MnSb at low tem-
peratures likewise observed no gap, with a resolution of
0.5 meV18. Moreover, the system undergoes a spin re-
orientation between 140 K and 90 K suggesting that the
magnetic anisotropy is small and strongly temperature-
dependent5. For these reasons, no spin gap term was
included when ﬁtting the data. The line through the
data of Fig. 2 is the ﬁt, showing that the dispersion was
able to be accurately reproduced with the model that
only included the Mn-Mn exchange terms given below,
without any terms to account for Bi moments or a spin
gap, though these may still be present. The lower panels
of Fig. 2 show constant energy slices from the related ma-
terial Mn1.13Sb at 20 meV18, and from MnBi at 20 meV,
40 meV and 60 meV. Comparing both 20 meV slices, we
see that there is additional scattering in Mn1.13Sb along
the L-direction, arising from the presence of interstitial
Mn. The lack of that scattering in the MnBi data is con-
sistent with the diﬀraction measurements that have only
a small amount of interstitial Mn5.

The values of the exchange interactions are shown
in Table I. The eﬀective nearest-neighbor interaction is
strongly antiferromagnetic, while the rest of the terms are

smaller and ferromagnetic. However, due to the larger
number of neighbors at greater distances, the ferromag-
netic terms more than compensate for the J1 term, lead-
ing to a ferromagnetic ground state. The antiferromag-
netic J1 term is somewhat unexpected, due to the large
Mn-Mn distance25,26, but a ﬁt that forced J1 to be ferro-
magnetic did not reproduce the data. As a further con-
sistency check on the nature of the magnetic interactions,
we have performed ﬁrst principles calculations of the ef-
fective Heisenberg exchange parameters using the gener-
alized gradient approximation (GGA)27 in the planewave
all-electron density functional theory code WIEN2K28
(see the Supplemental Information)24. In agreement with
the experiment, J1 is found to be large and antiferromag-
netic, but the ground state is ferromagnetic due to mod-

The remaining
exchange constants are all small, as was found in the
ﬁts to the experimental data. The calculations ﬁnd that
the antiferromagnetic state lies some 135 meV per Mn
higher than the ferromagnetic ground state, leading to a
mean-ﬁeld estimated Curie temperature of 522 K, in rea-
sonable agreement with experiment. While the nearest-
neighbor exchange term being antiferromagnetic is unex-
pected, both the calculations and the experimental data
conclude that the long-ranged nature of the Mn exchange
give rise to ferromagnetism. This competition between
antiferromagnetic local exchange and the ferromagnetic
itinerant exchange component may also be responsible for
the reduction of the moment to 3.90 µB from the nominal
5. However, the long-range charac-
moment of gS = 4 µB
ter in MnBi clearly dominates, especially when compared
to isostructural and isoelectronic Mn binary systems (see
Table II).

TABLE II. Magnetic properties of various MnT (T = Bi, Sb,
As, P) materials. These compounds are found to be ferro-
magnetic, where the distance between the Mn ions increases
with increasing size of the T ion. This suggests that there is
a systematic increase in the role of the extended exchange,
which results in higher moments and transition temperatures
for larger T atoms in the MnT series. This agrees well with
the results of the inelastic neutron scattering on MnBi. (cid:63)The
compound MnP is orthorhombic, a slight distortion of the
NiAs-type structure of the other compounds listed here. This
leads to a helical magnetic state below 50 K, however the mag-
netic structure between 50 K and TC = 292 K is the same as
for the other MnT compounds.

Of these materials, MnBi has the highest Curie tem-
perature and largest ordered moment. This is likely
due to the larger inter-Mn distance, which reduces the
nearest-neighbor exchange, and places increased empha-
sis on the higher-order exchange terms. Therefore we ex-
pect similar spin wave measurements of these compounds
to demonstrate a systematic shift from long-ranged to
more local interactions. These measurements are greatly
complicated by the inclusion of interstitial Mn18, and it
also remains an open question to what degree the in-
terstitial ions inﬂuence the moment and exchange path-
ways in these various systems30. However, the systematic
changes through the Mn binary ferromagnets are likely
controlled by the varying importance of the long-range
interactions.

In conclusion, we have observed well-deﬁned spin
waves in MnBi. In order to characterize the spin waves,
a Heisenberg model with six exchange constants has
been ﬁt to the data. The need to include terms out to
d = 7.5 ˚A suggests that the Mn-Mn exchange is itin-

4

erant, and the data taken here shows that any gap in
this material is less than 6 meV. The resulting ﬁts to the
data have shown that the nearest-neighbor term is an-
tiferromagnetic, while all of the higher-order terms are
ferromagnetic. This quantitative determination of the
exchange parameters shows that the long-range interac-
tions are the determining factor in the ferromagnetic or-
dering, a trend that can explain the reduction in ordered
moment and Curie temperature in isostructural and iso-
electronic Mn binary systems.

The strength and sign of the exchange constants
in MnBi should form a basis for comparing to non-
stoichiometric Mn1.08Bi, as well as other Mn binary fer-
romagnets: MnAs, MnP and MnSb, particularly in un-
derstanding the role of interstitial Mn on the magnetic
properties. Finally, the results obtained here shed light
on the role of extended exchange in determining the es-
sential characteristics of MnBi for use in permanent mag-
net applications.
