How can eﬀective barotropic matter emerge from the interaction of cosmological ﬂuids in an

isotropic and homogeneous cosmological model ?

The dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker universes
is a natural special case of generalized Lotka-Volterra systems where each of the universes ﬂuid
components can be seen as a competitive species in a predator-prey model. (Jungle universe : [7])
In addition to numerical simulations illustrating this behaviour among the barotropic ﬂuids
ﬁlling the universe, we analytically pinpoint that eﬀective time-dependent barotropic indices can
arise from a physical coupling between those ﬂuids whose dynamics could then look like that of
another type of cosmic ﬂuid, such as a cosmological constant.

Since the nature of dark energy is still unknown, this dynamical approach could help under-

standing some of the properties of dark matter and dark energy at large cosmological scales.

Introduction

Einstein’s general relativity for gravitation has led him to study the dynamics of the universe. His
cosmology describes an isotropic, homogeneous and static universe, while the current ΛCDM model
includes a possible accelerated expansion supported by the observation of distant supernovae [1, 2]
and the cosmic microwave background [3]. This late-time cosmic acceleration could be explained by
dark energy whose nature still remains undetermined.

Several possible explanations have been proposed to account for this acceleration, from modiﬁca-
tions of gravity - with f (R) gravity, scalar-tensor theories, braneworlds - to new cosmological ﬂuids
such as generalised Chaplygin gas, scalar ﬁeld with various couplings with matter, or more naturally
non-gravitational couplings between the constituents of the universe [4]. But the form of these time-
dependent [5] and often linear [6] interactions generally lacks physical justiﬁcations, see [8, 9] for exact
solutions with interacting ﬂuids and physical discussion on energy exchanges.

After a reformulation of the standard cosmological model in terms of the density proportion of the
constituents ﬁlling the universe, we study a natural quadratic coupling between cosmological ﬂuids
suggested by the intrinsic Lotka-Volterra structure of the ﬁelds equations. This coupling leads to an
eﬀective dynamical behaviour [7]. We eventually propose the basis for a new interpretation of the
acceleration of the universe.

1 The standard universe is a generalised predator-prey system

The dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker universes is a
special case of generalised Lotka-Volterra system where the competitive species are the barotropic
cosmological ﬂuids ﬁlling the universe, as it will be underlined in this section.

The ﬁeld equations of the standard cosmological model can be written as

in IRn+1. The search for equilibria in a Lotka-Volterra system governing the evolution of n + 1 inde-
pendent ﬂuids, with a (n + 1)th ﬂuid made of curvature with index k, consists in solving ˙Ω = 0 =
diag(Ω) (A Ω + r), see e.g. [10] chap. 4.
If all ﬂuids interact with each other only gravitationally,
then the system (A Ω + r) = 0 has no solution, since the capacity vector does not lie in the image of
the community matrix. The ﬂat Minkowski spacetime is the solution of diag(Ω) = 0, while all other
equilibria correspond to universes containing a single ﬂuid j, i.e. when Ωj (cid:54)= 0 but Ωi(cid:54)=j = 0, then
diag(Ω) is a zero divisor matrix.
The usual asymptotic states of FLRW universes, such as Einstein-de Sitter (Ωm (cid:54)= 0), de Sitter
(ΩΛ (cid:54)= 0) or Milne (Ωk (cid:54)= 0) universes, thus appear as particular equilibria between cosmic species,
where generally one species dominates the others, see Fig. 1. These equilibria correspond to Ω vectors
with only one non-zero value which equals 1 because of (2). Consequently, in the absence of non-
gravitational interactions, they must lie on the axes of (Ωi, Ωj)-planes for all i, j = 0, . . . , n + 1.

2 Jungle Universes : cooperation and competition among cosmic

ﬂuids

A universe without any interaction between cosmological ﬂuids apart from a gravitational one seems
a little awkward, whereas a natural coupling between cosmic ﬂuids leads to a much richer dynamics.
Various types of coupling, most of the time linear in the densities [6], have been proposed by
several authors, see e.g. [5], but very few with non-linear interactions have been studied [11, 12, 13].
Except for scalar ﬁelds, the non-linearity is introduced in the equations of state [14] but rarely as
an interaction between ﬂuids [15, 16]. A natural non-linear coupling preserving the intrinsic Lotka-
Volterra structure previously mentioned has been studied in [7]. This “jungle coupling”, deﬁned by
Q(ij) = ij Ωi Ωj, naturally vanishes in the absence of one of the interacting ﬂuids, and the interaction
rate increases with the coupled densities. Interactions which are proportionnal to the product of these
densities also provide one of the best observational ﬁts for holographic dark energy models coupled

partially breaks the degeneracy of the community matrix A. Equilibria may be located outside the
axes of (Ωi, Ωj)-planes. The associated dynamics can contain limit cycles (Fig. 2), universes with
several ﬂuids in equilibrium, and even chaos which has been conjectured for more than four ﬂuids in
interaction. The dynamical behaviours in this so-called Jungle Universe could answer some questions
such as the coincidence problem.

Further dynamical properties are explained in [7]. In the last section, we will employ the time
evolution of the dynamical behaviour of interacting cosmological ﬂuids to look for the possibility of
an eﬀective dark energy.

JUNGLE COUPLING ?

3 Camouﬂage in the jungle : could dark energy emerge from the

jungle coupling ?

The observed accelerated expansion of the universe suggests the existence of a cosmological constant
or at least dark energy of unknown nature. Could a coupling among cosmic ﬂuids lead to a similar
behaviour instead ?

Using the formalism of Jungle Universes, we suggest hereafter that the acceleration of the expansion
could result from a special interaction between ﬂuids of known properties. The interaction term in
the continuity equation of a ﬂuid i reads

Consequently a dominant negative term can appear in the second member of (1), which is equivalent
to an acceleration ¨a > 0.
As an illustration, consider three dark matter ﬂuids with the ﬁrst two and last two interacting with
each other. Indexing them from 1 to 3, with 12 = −2 and 23 = −3, the mutual interactions make
the third ﬂuid asymptotically dominate the others in terms of density with an eﬀective barotropic
index close to −1, see Fig. 3. Thus ﬂuid 3 dynamically behaves nearly as a cosmological constant. In
the same way, the ﬁrst ﬂuid looks like a perfect gas while the second one still behaves as a dark matter.

Interaction between three dark matter ﬂuids : evolution of their density and eﬀective

Couplings between barotropic cosmological ﬂuids change their observed behaviour and can inﬂu-
ence the global dynamics of the universe. The acceleration of the universe could then be explained in
a natural way without introducing unknown types of energy.

Conclusion

The natural generalised Lotka-Volterra structure of the evolution of the universe constituent densities
has enabled us to describe the isotropic and homogenous universe as a generalised predator-prey sys-
tem. The eﬀective barotropic indices that emerge from the natural quadratic jungle coupling between
cosmological ﬂuids induce various dynamics of the evolution of the scale factor and ﬂuid densities,
from limit cycles to possible chaos. We have made a simulation of an eﬀective cosmological constant
