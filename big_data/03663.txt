Abstract.
In this work we study the entanglement entropy of a uniform quantum Ising chain
in transverse ﬁeld undergoing a periodic driving of period τ . By means of Floquet theory we
show that, for any subchain, the entanglement entropy tends asymptotically to a value τ -
periodic in time. We provide a semi-analytical formula for the leading term of this asymptotic
value: It is constant in time and obeys a volume law. The asymptotic value is always smaller
than the thermal one. Because of integrability the system does not thermalize locally, but
relaxes to a generalized Gibbs ensemble. Remarkably, the asymptotic entropy shows marked
features in correspondence to some non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions undergone by
a Floquet state analog of the ground state.

1. Introduction

Understanding entanglement in quantum many-body systems is a powerful way to unveil their
properties (see the reviews [1, 2]). Among all possible ways to quantify non-local correlations
in a many-particle system a key role is played by the entanglement entropy [3]. For a system
characterized by a (pure state) density matrix ρ = |Ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)Ψ| the entanglement entropy is deﬁned,
given a partition into two subsystems A and B, and a corresponding reduced density matrix
ρA = TrB ρ, as the von Neumann entropy of ρA, SA = − TrA ρA log ρA.

The scaling of SA with the size of the subsystem A carries distinct information on the state
of the system [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The ground state of a short-range Hamiltonian obey
an area law (scaling like the measure of the border of subsystem A), with corrections arising when
the system approaches a critical point. Excited states, on the other side, in a similar fashion
as thermal states, follow typically (with notable exceptions being many-body localized states) a
volume law, where the scaling is with the measure of subsystem A.

Understanding the behaviour of entanglement entropy is also important in the description of
the non-equilibrium dynamics of closed quantum many-body systems [13]. Numerous examples
support this statement. Entanglement entropy was analysed in the adiabatic dynamics of a
many-body system passing through a critical point [14, 15, 16]. On the opposite case of a rapid
change of the coupling parameters, a quantum quench, Calabrese and Cardy [17] ﬁrst studied
the time-dependence of the entropy in an integrable one-dimensional spin chain and found that
it increases linearly before saturating to an asymptotic value (that scales with the volume of the
subsystem). The entropy growth slows down in the presence of disorder [18]. For a many-body

localized state entropy increases logarithmically [19, 18, 20, 21], a behaviour intimately connected
to the dephasing mechanism characteristic of this phase. In addition to the interest in its own,
the study of the entanglement is also of utmost importance in connection with the possibility
to numerically study correlated systems by means of classical simulations, as e.g. the density
matrix renormalization group [22, 5]. Indeed the power of numerical simulations is limited by
the amount of entanglement present in the quantum state.

We will analyse the entanglement entropy in another class of non-equilibrium dynamics in
which the quantum system is subject to a periodic driving. In recent years there has been an
uprising interest for periodically driven quantum systems, the possibility to reach asymptotic
time-periodic steady states and their possible thermal properties [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,
31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. By means of Floquet theory [42, 43, 44], formal
similarities between this case and that of a quantum quench have been discovered and at the
same time, many results ﬁrst obtained in the case of a quantum quench have been generalized
to the periodic driving case. One example is the relaxation to the Floquet diagonal ensemble of
periodically driven systems [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 45].

l

The behaviour of the entanglement entropy has been analysed in few cases also in periodically
driven systems. The relation between entanglement entropy growth and transition from a
many-body localized state to ergodicity is the same in periodically driven system and quantum
quenches [28]. A transition between a regime with anomalous scaling exponents in the
entanglement entropy at ﬁnite time of an integrable fermionic system was discussed in Ref. [46].
In this paper we consider the entanglement properties of an integrable quantum spin chain.
We focus on the entanglement entropy Sl(t) of a subchain of length l for a quantum Ising chain
in transverse ﬁeld undergoing a time-periodic driving of period τ [35, 36]. The entanglement
entropy increases linearly in time, until an asymptotic condition is reached; the duration of the
transient scales linearly with the size l of the subchain (this is due to the fact that the driving
excites quasi-particles which spread correlations at a ﬁnite velocity; the picture is the same as
in Ref. [17]). In the long-time limit the entanglement entropy relaxes to a τ -periodic asymptotic
value S(∞)
(t) ‡. We are able to express this asymptotic value in terms of the Floquet states
of the driven system. Moreover, we show that this asymptotic value, at leading order, is linear
in l: In the asymptotic regime the entropy follows a volume law. We provide a semi-analytical
formula for the coeﬃcient of the leading order term and ﬁnd that it is not only τ -periodic but
even time-independent. We ﬁnd an analytical formula closely resembling the corresponding one
for the case of the quantum quench (see Ref. [17]). Even though the asymptotic entropy follows
a volume law, it is always well below the completely mixed density matrix value l log 2. The
system relaxes locally, without ever reaching thermal equilibrium (which in the driven case is
only possible at T = ∞). Although being continuously driven, it absorbs only a ﬁnite amount
of energy until a stationary condition diﬀerent from the thermal one is reached. This is strictly
connected with the integrability of the system: it does not thermalize locally but reaches a non-
thermal asymptotic condition [45, 35, 38] described by a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE)
(see [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 13] for more results on the GGE). This GGE asymptotic condition
depends on the parameters of the driving: we see marked peaks in the asymptotic entropy in
correspondence to some non-equilibrium quantum phase transition of a Floquet state analog of
the ground state [53].

The behaviour we observe is peculiar to driven integrable systems.

In the driven non-
integrable case, on the contrary, there are two possibilities.
If the dynamics is ergodic, then
the entanglement entropy increases linearly in time until the completely mixed state value is
reached; in the many-body localized case, instead, the entanglement entropy shows a logarithmic
‡ Similar phenomenology can be also seen in Fig.1 of Ref. [46]. Here the authors focus on phenomena at ﬁnite
time and do not make any comment on relaxation to an asymptotic condition.

increase [28].

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the dynamics of the uniform
quantum Ising chain in a time-periodic transverse ﬁeld discussing the application of Floquet
theory to this problem. Section 3 is the heart of this paper: we evaluate the entanglement
entropy in the periodically driven case showing that the entanglement entropy for any subchain
relaxes to an asymptotically periodic value. We show also that the leading term of the asymptotic
value obeys volume law; we ﬁnd a semi-analytical formula for this term. In Section 4 we show
some numerical results corroborating our analysis and in Section 5 we draw our conclusions.
Most technical details and analytical derivations can be found in the appendices.

While this manuscript was in preparation, we became aware of similar results obtained by

T. Apollaro, G. M. Palma and J. Marino [54].

2. Periodically driven quantum Ising chain

provide more details in Appendix A and Appendix B. The Hamiltonian of the system is

Here, the σx,z
are spins (Pauli matrices) at site j of a chain of length L with boundary conditions
which can be periodic (PBC) σx,z
L+1 = 0, and J is a longitudinal
coupling (J = 1 in the following). The transverse ﬁeld is taken uniform and time-periodic,
h(t) = h(t+τ ). This Hamiltonian can be transformed, through a Jordan-Wigner transformation
(see Eq. (A.1) and Refs. [55, 56]), into a quadratic-fermion form. At equilibrium and for a
homogeneous transverse ﬁeld, h(t) = h0, the model has two gapped phases, a ferromagnetic
(|h0| < 1), and a paramagnetic (|h0| > 1) one, separated by a quantum phase transition at
hc = 1. Assume now that the transverse ﬁeld oscillates periodically, for t ≥ 0, around the
uniform value h, with some amplitude A. If we assume PBC, we can quite simplify the analysis:
going to k-space (we discuss more general cases in Appendix A) ˆH(t) becomes a sum of two-level
systems:

brieﬂy refer to such a set of k, in the following, as k ∈ ABC. The Hamiltonian can be block-

assume that at time t = 0 the coherent evolution starts with the system in the ground state

diagonalized in each k sector with instantaneous eigenvalues ±Ek(t) = ±(cid:112)2

The evolution of the system can be naturally described through a Floquet analysis [35, 36].

the related supplementary material. In Appendix A we show how to extend this picture to the
case of OBC or inhomogeneous couplings; in this section we focus on the case of PBC because

The previous analysis applies to a general h(t). For a time-periodic h(t), we can ﬁnd a basis

3. Dynamics of entanglement entropy in the periodically driven Ising chain

1, . . . l, we can construct the entanglement entropy of the subchain as Sl(t) = −(cid:80)l

The entanglement entropy can be obtained from the solutions uk(t) and vk(t) of the Bogoliubov-
de Gennes equations (4). In Appendix B we show how to use these solutions to compute a special
2l × 2l time-dependent Toeplitz matrix (Eq. (C.5)). In terms of its 2l eigenvalues ±νm(t), m =
m=1 H(νm(t)),
where we have deﬁned the function H(x) = − 1+x
a generic time-dependent h(t).

In the case of a periodic driving, h(t + τ ) = h(t), we can say something more. By applying
the Floquet theory and the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, we are able to show that the entanglement
entropy tends towards an asymptotic value which is τ -periodic. We ﬁnd that this asymptotically
periodic entanglement entropy can be obtained from the eigenvalues a special 2l × 2l τ -periodic
Toeplitz matrix (Eq. (C.5)) which can be evaluated starting from the Floquet solutions of
the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations (5). Deﬁning the eigenvalues of such Toeplitz matrix as

All the details of the derivations of this expression are reported in Appendix C. The discovery
of this relaxation phenomenon is one of the main results of the paper.

An important, we believe, observation is that S (∞)

(t) obeys a volume law. With an

argument analogous to the one used in Ref. [17], we show in Appendix D that

where r±
k have been deﬁned in Eq. (5). Hence, remarkably, the leading term in the asymptotic
τ -periodic entanglement entropy is time-independent and proportional to l (with logarithmic
corrections): this is reminiscent of the result valid in the case of a quantum quench, found in
Ref. [17]. Moreover, r±
k depend strongly on what is the chosen initial state, and so does s(∞);
in particular, we never see thermalization, as we are going to show in the next section where we
substantiate our analytical formulae with numerical results.

4. Numerical results

Numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations (4) by means of a 4th-order Runge-
Kutta algorithm (see for instance [57]), we can explicitly see the relaxation of the entanglement
entropy and the validity of the asymptotic value expansion Eq. (7). In all this section we choose
a driving of the form

h(t) = h0 + A sin (ω0t) .

In the presentation of the results we will restrict to stroboscopic times of the form tn = nτ with
τ = 2π/ω0. On one side, this choice simpliﬁes the numerical calculations. On the other side,
the asymptotically periodic condition for S (∞)
(t) appears as an approach to a constant value
S (∞)

(0), which can be more easily seen.
We show some examples of stroboscopic relaxation in Fig. 1.

In all the cases we have
considered, we see that the (stroboscopic) entanglement entropy reaches, after a transient, its
asymptotic value S (∞)
(0). We can see that the transient lasts for a time linearly scaling with
l. It is not diﬃcult to qualitatively understand this fact. Driving the system generates quasi-
particle excitations which propagate at ﬁnite elocity, bringing with them correlations: a longer
subchain takes proportionally more time to get entangled with the rest of the system. This
picture strictly resembles the case of quantum quench of [17]. It explains why the leading term
in the asymptotic entanglement entropy follows a volume law: quasi-particles are generated in
every point of the subchain so, after a while, the whole subchain is correlated with the rest of
the system. In the top panels of Fig. 1 we show the situation in the case of PBC on the spins
(ABC on the fermions), in the bottom ones we consider the case of OBC. In the second case the
convergence to the asymptotic value is slower (more or less) by a factor 2: we are considering a
subchain with a loose end, and excitations can propagate only towards one direction. Moreover,
taking OBC, the oscillations around the asymptotic value seem to be smaller than in the PBC
case.
In the left panel of Fig. 2, we show the dependence on l of the asymptotic entanglement
entropy S (∞)
(0), compared with the semi-analytical result of the leading term l s(∞) (Eq. 7): we
see a quite good agreement. In the right panel of the same ﬁgure we plot the rescaled diﬀerence
S (∞)
− s(∞), which clearly tends to 0 for l → ∞. Therefore, for l → ∞ we have that l s(∞) is
l
a very good approximation for S (∞)

Fig. 4): ±Ek (h0) = ±(cid:112)(h0 − cos k)2 + ∆2

Fig. 3 shows the dependence of s(∞) on ω0. We see some marked peaks: they appear in
correspondence with a series of Floquet resonances [58, 40]. These resonances are discussed
in Ref. [58], where it is shown that their positions do not depend on the speciﬁc form of
the periodic drive h(t) but only on its time-averaged value h0. To better understand these
resonances, we have to consider the unperturbed spectrum which is made by the two bands (see
k. In the vanishing amplitude limit (A → 0), if a k
mode obeys the relation nω0 = 2Ek (h0), it shows a n-photon resonance. Moving to the case
of non-vanishing driving amplitude, in general, these resonances develop into avoided crossings
in the quasi-energy spectrum (see [59, 53] and the Supplemental Material of [35]). The exact

degeneracies persist only if they occur at k = 0 or k = π. The k = 0 resonances occur when
2|h0 − hc| = p ω0, the k = π ones if 2|h0 + hc| = lω0 (p, l ∈ Z is the order of the resonance –
see Fig. 4) [58]. We see in Fig. 3 very large peaks for the k = 0 resonances, and much smaller
features at the k = π resonances. § As discussed in Ref. [53], these resonances correspond to
second-order quantum phase transitions of a special Floquet state (the so-called “Floquet ground
state”) whose behaviour is analogous to that of the ground state of a physical system. Although
we are considering the entanglement entropy of a state very diﬀerent from the Floquet ground
state, we remarkably see in the behaviour of s(∞) some traces of the quantum phase transitions
of this special state.
We would like to stress that in all the cases we have considered, s(∞) is always well below
the thermal T = ∞ value log(2) (being the system periodically driven, it can only thermalize
§ As a matter of fact, the transitions between diﬀerent behaviours of the entanglement entropy at ﬁnite time
observed in Ref. [46] occur at resonance points strictly analogous to ours. The authors consider a one-dimensional
periodically driven fermionic system of the form Eq. (2):
see transitions in the scaling of the ﬁnite-time
entanglement entropy at those frequencies where one more extremum in the Floquet spectrum µk appears. Such
extrema appear right at our resonance points (see SM of [35].

Generalized Gibbs ensemble [45, 35, 38].
As we go to small frequencies, s(∞) decreases. This is expected in the adiabatic limit,
where the driving excites a vanishingly small number of excitations: there is indeed nothing
which can propagate quantum correlations. The adiabatic limit occurs when the characteristic
frequency scale of the perturbation is much smaller than the minimum energy gap encountered
during the dynamics [60]. Thanks to the factorization of the Hamiltonian (see Eq. (2)), only

Instead, at the frequency where the mode at k = π is resonant

the single-particle gaps (those for each 2 × 2 k−subspace) are important: the adiabatic limit
hence corresponds to ω0 (cid:28) 2|h0 − hc|. From a numerical point of view, it would be quite time-
consuming to consider very small frequencies in Fig. 3. When the frequency is very small, the
Floquet spectrum undergoes multiple foldings in the ﬁrst Floquet-Brillouin zone [−ω0/2, ω0/2]:
as k changes the quasi-energies µ±
k undergo many avoided crossings. At each crossing, the
quantities |r±
k |2 undergo quite sudden changes (see the SM of [35]): hence the integrand in
Eq. (7) is a strongly oscillating function of k. For very low frequencies, we need indeed very ﬁne
meshes in k (hence, very long chains) to obtain a good estimate of the integral.

5. Conclusion and perspectives

We have discussed the behaviour of the entanglement entropy in a chain of a time-periodically-
driven quantum Ising chain in transverse ﬁeld. We have observed that the entanglement entropy
relaxes asymptotically to a time-periodic value with the same period of the driving. The
asymptotic entropy is attained after a transient in time whose duration scales linearly with
the size of the subsystem; we are able to express this asymptotic value in terms of the Floquet
states of the driven system. The asymptotic entropy, at leading order, follows a volume law in the
size of the chain: we have found a semi-analytical formula for the coeﬃcient of the leading order
term. Quite remarkably, this coeﬃcient is not periodic but time-independent; its dependence on
ω0 is reminiscent of quantum phase transitions of the Floquet ground state. Although following
a volume law, the asymptotic entropy stays always well below the thermal value: the system is
integrable and locally relaxes to a GGE ensemble. It is interesting to consider what happens to
the picture presented in presence of disorder. In principle, arbitrary inhomogenous couplings can
be tackled by the approach presented in Appendix A. But disorder should lead to localization
of the states, and hence correlations should not be able to propagate eﬃciently [36, 61, 62]. We
defer to future publications the analysis of the non-uniform chain case and the study of diﬀerent
time-driving protocols. It would also be interesting to know if an analysis for generic driven one-
dimensional systems based on conformal ﬁeld theory is possible, in the spirit of what Ref. [17]
does for quenched one-dimensional systems.

Appendix A. - Bogoliubov-de Gennes dynamics

not assume translational invariance therefore Fourier transform to momentum space cannot be
employed We closely follow the discussion of Ref. [36]. Generically, if ˆcj denote the L fermionic

To discuss the quantum dynamics when ˆH(t) depends on time, one starts by writing the
Heisenberg equations of motion for the ˆΨ, which turn out to be linear, due to the quadratic
nature of ˆH(t). A simple calculation shows that:

A solution is evidently given by

with the same (cid:98)γ used to diagonalize the initial t = 0 problem, as long as the time-dependent

coeﬃcients of the unitary 2L× 2L matrix U(t) satisfy the ordinary linear Bogoliubov-de Gennes
time-dependent equations:

U(t) = 2H(t) · U(t)

(A.8)
with initial conditions U(t = 0) = U0. It is easy to verify that the time-dependent Bogoliubov-de
Gennes form implies that the operators ˆγα(t) in the Schr¨odinger picture are time-dependent and
annihilate the time-dependent state |ψ(t)(cid:105). Notice that U(t) looks like the unitary evolution
operator of a 2L-dimensional problem with Hamiltonian 2H(t). This implies that one can use
a Floquet analysis to get U(t) whenever H(t) is time-periodic. This trick provides us with
single-particle Floquet modes and quasi-energies in terms of which we can evaluate, through the
Heisenberg picture prescription, any two-point correlator
. Because the state is
Gaussian, from those objects one can reconstruct the expectation of any operator and also the
entanglement entropy of any subchain as we show in Appendix B. To that purpose, it is very
useful to rewrite Eq. (A.7) in the Schr¨odinger representation: we obtain

Appendix B. - Evaluation of the entanglement entropy

In this section we show explicitly the computation of the entanglement entropy in the driven
quantum Ising chain which leads to the results of Sec. 3. We express the entropy in terms of the
solution of the dynamical Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations (Appendix A). We generalize to the
case of driven systems the methods for the evaluation of the entanglement entropy in the static
chain introduced in Ref. [5].

Appendix B.1.

- Correlation matrix of the Majorana operators

In this subsection we introduce Majorana fermions starting from the Bogoliubov fermions
of Appendix A and then we express their correlation matrix in terms of the solution of the

Entanglement entropy in a periodically driven Ising chain

11

dynamical Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. We are going to see in Subsection Appendix B.2
that this correlation matrix is an essential ingredient to evaluate the entanglement entropy of
any sub-chain. We are going to see ﬁrst the generic case and then the translationally-invariant
one. In the latter case, the correlation matrix assumes a Block-diagonal form in k-space, which
allows to fasten the numerical calculations.

Generic, non translationally invariant case. We consider a generic form of external driving: we
can apply the results of Appendix A. In particular, by inverting the unitary matrix U(t) obeying
Eq. (A.8), we can rewrite Eq. (A.9) in the form

of equations Eq. (4). Here the Fermionic Hamiltonian is block-diagonal (see Eq. (2)). Also the
Bogoliubov operators Eq. (A.10) have deﬁnite momentum and are related to the ˆck by means of
a unitary transformation constructed by means of the uk and vk of Eq. (3)

Introducing the Majorana operators as in Eq. (B.2), we ﬁnd that the ˇγ2k−1 and the ˇc2k−1 are

- Entanglement entropy

From the correlation matrix (Eq. (B.8) or Eq. (B.15)), the entanglement entropy of any subchain
can be evaluated by means of the standard method introduced in Ref. [5]. For reader convenience,
we report this discussion in the present subsection. We select a subchain made by l adjacent
spins. The entanglement entropy associated to this partition is evaluated as the Von Neumann
entropy of the reduced density matrix ˆρl for the l adjacent spins

We can expand the density matrix ρl of the block as

Sl(t) = − Tr [ˆρl(t) log ˆρl(t)] .

As they show in [5], this implies that ρµ1···µl (t) = 0 whenever the number of indices j for which
µ = 2 and µ = 3 is odd.

Applying the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we can express Eq. (B.20) as a combination
of many-point Fermionic correlators. Because the state of the system is Gaussian, we can apply
Wick theorem: we can express the many-point correlators in terms of the two-point Majorana
correlators which form the subsystem correlation matrix 12l + iΓC

l (t) (see Eq. (??)).

To ﬁnd the entanglement entropy, we have to block-diagonalize this matrix; the result is the

block-diagonal matrix +

From Eq. (B.22), we can see that the mode ˇd2j−1 is only correlated to the mode ˇd2j: a most

This means that the L fermionic modes are uncorrelated: they are in a product state

ρl(t) = ρ1(t) ⊗ . . . ⊗ ρl(t) .

This tensor product structure does not correspond in general to a factorization into local Hilbert
spaces of the l spins, but is instead a rather non-local structure. The density matrix ρj has

Being the objects in Eq. B.25 the eigenvalues of a density matrix, they are real and are in
the interval [0, 1]; this implies that νj ∈ [−1, 1]. The spectrum of ρl results now from the l-fold
product of the spectra of the density matrices ρj, and the entropy of ρl is the sum of the entropies
of the l uncorrelated modes,

Sl(t) =

H (νj(t)) .

(B.27)

The evaluation of the correlation matrix and the entanglement entropy can be easily implemented
numerically. In the plots of Fig. 1 we perform the numerical evaluation of the entropy at ﬁnite
time using the general form of the correlation matrix Eq. (B.8).

We see indeed that the correlation matrix relaxes asymptotically to a periodic value, and the

- Numerical implementations

In the ﬁnite-time calculations of Fig. 1 – as we have explained in the foregoing section – we
always implement the general form of the correlation matrix Eq. (B.8). Although the form given
by Eqs. (B.15) and (C.3) may seem more appropriate for the PBC translationally invariant case,
it is highly inconvenient. This is due to the integrands Rk(t), Ik(t) and Qk(t), rapidly becoming
too fast oscillating functions of k because of the e−iµkt factors. To evaluate the correlation matrix
Eq. (B.8), we have indeed to numerically solve the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations Eq. (A.8):
with our resources tthis is possible in a reasonable time for L up to ∼ 800. This is the reason
why we cannot follow the convergence of the entanglement entropy in Fig. 1 for very long times:
after a time scaling linearly with L, ﬁnite size eﬀects appear. The physical motivation of the
ﬁnite size eﬀects lies in the propagation of quasi-particles at ﬁnite velocity, as detailed in [36].

On the opposite – considering the the asymptotic entropy S(∞)
(0) and Q(∞)

(0),
I (∞)
(0) (see Eq. (C.4)) are smooth functions of k which can be easily evaluated
k
even with moderate values of L (and then not too tight meshes in k – there is some caveat for
small frequencies which we discuss in Sec. 4). Indeed, Eq. (C.5) is very suitable for the numerical
evaluation of the asymptotic entropy. The resulting asymptotic entropy is appropriate both
for the OBC case and the PBC one: the reason is the argument based on the propagation of
quasi-particles that we explain in Sec. 4.
