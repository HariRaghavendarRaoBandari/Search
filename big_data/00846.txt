MAPPING CLASS GROUP ORBITS OF CURVES

WITH SELF-INTERSECTIONS

PATRICIA CAHN, FEDERICA FANONI AND BRAM PETRI

Abstract. We study mapping class group orbits of homotopy and isotopy classes of
curves with self-intersections. We exhibit the asymptotics of number of such orbits, on
a genus g surface with k self-intersections, for k bounded and g → ∞. To do this we
count embeddings of ribbon graphs.

As a corollary of our methods, we obtain that most curves that are homotopic are also
isotopic. Furthermore, using a theorem by Basmajian, we get a bound on the number of
mapping class group orbits on a hyperbolic surface that can contain short curves. For
a ﬁxed length, this bound is polynomial in the genus of the surface.

1. Introduction

Recently, there has been a lot of progress on counting curves on surfaces. There are essen-
tially two questions to answer, a geometric and a topological one. Loosely speaking, the
topological question asks how many curves there are with certain topological properties
and the geometric question asks how many closed geodesics (with given topological prop-
erties) there are up to a certain length. We start with a brief and incomplete overview of
the work that has been done on these questions. We will restrict our attention to closed
surfaces.

The classical geometric result is by Huber [10] and Margulis [12] and states that given
a negatively curved, complete and ﬁnite volume metric on a closed surface Σg of genus
g ≥ 2, the number GL of closed geodesics up to length L > 0 satisﬁes

GL ∼ eδL
δL

as L → ∞

where δ is the topological entropy of the geodesic ﬂow and the symbol ‘∼’ means that
the ratio of the two quantities tends to 1 as L → ∞. If the metric is hyperbolic (constant
curvature −1) then δ = 1, which is the case that Huber considered. Note that on a surface
with a negatively curved metric, closed geodesics naturally correspond to free homotopy
classes (see for instance [7, Prop. 1.3]), which means that counting closed geodesics is the
same as counting free homotopy classes.

In [14], Mirzakhani showed that the number SL of simple closed geodesics (closed geodesics
with no self-intersections) up to length L > 0 on a complete hyperbolic structure X on
Σg satisﬁes

SL ∼ bX L6g−6 as L → ∞

where bX is a continuous and proper function on the moduli space of hyperbolic structures
on Σg. Earlier results were obtained by Rees [17], McShane and Rivin [13] and Rivin [18].

Part of the proof of this result relies on dividing the geodesics in to mapping class group
(denoted MCG(Σg)) orbits and then counting the number of curves in a ﬁxed orbit.

Even more recently the asymptotics of number of closed geodesics with a bounded number
of self-intersections in a given MCG(Σg)-orbit up to a given length have been shown to
behave similarly by Rivin in [19] (for one self-intersection), Erlandsson and Souto [6] and
Mirzakhani [15].

The topological question asks how many MCG(Σg)-orbits, or topological types, there are
of (isotopy or homotopy) classes of curves (or sets of curves) with certain properties. Note
that in some cases this count is also necessary to complete the geometric picture.

It’s not hard to see that there are inﬁnitely many MCG(Σg)-orbits of curves on Σg. So
we need to consider smaller sets of curves. The classical topological result is that the
number Ng,0 of MCG(Σg)-orbits of homotopy classes of simple curves is equal to

(cid:106) g

(cid:107)

Ng,0 =

+ 1

where (cid:98)x(cid:99) denotes the ﬂoor of a real number x (see for instance [7, Section 1.3.1] for a
proof).

One can similarly deﬁne Ng,≤k to be the number of MCG(Σg)-orbits of homotopy classes
of curves with at most k self-intersections. This question is considerably more diﬃcult
than the simple case. For one thing, in this count it actually matters whether one considers
isotopy or homotopy classes. This is because, unlike the case of simple curves, these are
no longer the same for curves with self-intersections. In order to complete the count of the
number of geodesics on a hyperbolic surface with a bounded number of self-intersections
up to a bounded length, Sapir [20] considered the asymptotics of Ng,≤k for g ﬁxed and
k → ∞. She proved that

where dg is a constant depending only on the genus. Sapir used these results to answer
questions on the number of MCG(Σg)-orbits that contain short curves. Concretely, let
L > 0, X be a hyperbolic surface and Nk(X, L) denote the number of MCG(Σg)-orbits
of curves with k self-intersections the contain a curve of length at most L. She proves

K)(cid:111)

where lX and dX are constants depending only on X.

Another question of a similar ﬂavor that has been considered is that of complete 1-
systems. These are collections of isotopy classes of simple curves that pairwise intersect
exactly once.
In [11], Malestein, Rivin and Theran raised the question of how many
MCG(Σg)-orbits there are of such systems and showed that there is only one such orbit
when g = 1, 2. Aougab [1] and subsequently Aougab and Gaster [2] showed that this
does not persist in the higher genus case by constructing many such orbits. Note that the
methods for these proofs are similar to ours in spirit.

The question we ask is complementary to the one considered by Sapir. Instead of asking
how many curves there are with a large number of self-intersections on a ﬁxed surface,
we ask how many curves there are with a ﬁxed number of self-intersections on a surface

of a large genus. We have already noted that it makes a diﬀerence whether one asks for
homotopy classes or isotopy classes of curves. Let us start with homotopy classes.

Concretely, let Ng,k denote the number of MCG(Σg)-orbits of free homotopy classes of
curves on Σg with k self-intersections. We prove:
Theorem 1. Let k ∈ N. We have

where Ck = (cid:80)

as g → ∞

|Aut(∂Γ)| is a constant, depending only on k. The sum in Ck is taken

over certain ribbon graphs (see Section 4 for details).

To our knowledge, there is no formula for Ck that eliminates the dependence on ribbon
graphs. On the other hand, similar quantities have been counted, often in terms of Gauss
diagrams (see for instance [22]). These counts do give upper bounds for Ck, but they
are not sharp. The problem here is the automorphism group that appears in the terms.
Note: In her very recent work [20, Section 1.4], Sapir also suggested using cut-and-paste
techniques to count mapping class group orbits. She suggests applying these techniques
to small values of k but does not work out the asymptotics.

It also follows from our arguments that if we let N iso
classes of essential closed curves with k self-intersections, then:

g,k denote the number of free isotopy

g,k ∼ Ng,k

Pg

intersections contains exactly one isotopy class

for k ﬁxed and g → ∞. In other words, asymptotically it doesn’t matter whether one
counts orbits of istopy classes or homotopy classes. This also implies that the asymptotics

g,k respectively as
g → ∞ and hence that N iso
The result also implies a probabilistic version of Baer’s classical theorem [3] that says
that for simple curves isotopy and homotopy are the same:
Corollary 2. Let k ∈ N. Then as g → ∞

Theorem 1 has also geometric consequences. For this we need a result by Basmajian from
[4], where he proves that the number of self-intersections implies a lower bound for the
length of the curve (see Theorem 14 in Section 5).

PATRICIA CAHN, FEDERICA FANONI AND BRAM PETRI

Given L > 0 and a hyperbolic surface X of genus g(X), we will write N (X, L) for the
number of MCG(Σg(X))-orbits of closed geodesics on X that contain a curve of length at
most L. From Basmajian’s bounds we obtain:
Corollary 4. Let L > 0. There exist constants A = A(L) ∈ N and C = C(L) > 0 such
that for any hyperbolic surface X

N (X, L) ≤ C · g(X)A

Furthermore, A(L) can be made explicit (see Section 5).

Because all our results are obtained by counting embeddings of ribbon graphs, we believe
that our methods generalize to other sets of bounded numbers of disjoint curves with
bounded numbers of self-intersections. Also, by carefully going through the arguments
below, the case where k is a moderately growing function of g can also be handled.

2. Classical results and set up

2.1. Curves on surfaces. In this section we recall some classical theorems about curves
on surfaces. First we review results about minimal representatives of curves in a given
free homotopy class.
Let Σg be a closed, oriented surface of genus g. A smooth curve a : S1 → Σg is said to
be generic if its only singularities are transverse double points. Deﬁne the minimal self-
intersection number m(α)1 of a free homotopy class of curves α on Σg to be the minimum
number of double points of a generic representative a ∈ α. If m(α) = 0, α will be called
simple.

Theorem 5 ([8], Theorem 2). Let a be a generic curve on Σg which has excess self-
intersection. Then there is a singular 1-gon or 2-gon on Σg bounded by part of the image
of a.

By singular 1-gon we mean the image by a of an arc I of S1, such that a identiﬁes the
endpoints of I and a|I is a null-homotopic loop on Σg. A singular 2-gon is the image by
a of two disjoint arcs I and J of S1 such that a identiﬁes the endpoints of I and J and
a|I∪J is a null-homotopic loop on the surface. Note that these singular 1- or 2-gons do
not need to be embedded, but just immersed.

Note that if a has excess-self-intersection, then at least one of the surfaces in the comple-
ment of the image of a is homeomorphic to a disk. The converse is not true.

A third Reidemeister move is a local move pushing a branch of a curve across a double
points, as depicted in Figure 1.

1Some authors write m(α) = i(α, α), where i is the geometric intersection number.

MAPPING CLASS GROUP ORBITS OF CURVES WITH SELF-INTERSECTIONS

Figure 1. A third Reidemeister move

If we can perform a third Reidemeister move to a curve a, then one of the surfaces in the
complement of the image of a is homeomorphic to a disk. Furthermore, if a is in minimal
position and b is obtained by a via a third Reidemeister move, then b is in minimal position
too.

Theorem 6 ([5], Theorem 1). If a and b are two minimal representatives of the same
homotopy class, then there are a sequence of third Reidemeister moves from a to a curve
c and an ambient isotopy of Σg which induces an isotopy between a regular neighborhood
of c and a regular neighborhood of b.

2.2. Action of the mapping class group on non-simple classes. The mapping class
group of Σ is

MCG(Σ) = Homeo+(Σ)/≈

where ψ ≈ φ if they are homotopic.
A well known result of Baer [3] tells us that simple closed curves are homotopic if and
only if they are isotopic (if and only if there is an ambient isotopy of Σg sending one to the
other). Moreover, we know that two simple closed curves are in the same mapping class
group orbit if and only if the surfaces obtained by cutting along them are homeomorphic
(see [7, Section 1.3.1]).

None of these facts holds for nonsimple curves. First, nonsimple curves can be homotopic
and not isotopic (on the other hand Hass and Scott proved in [9] that there are only
ﬁnitely many isotopy classes within a given homotopy class). Second, curves with the
homeomorphic complements can be in diﬀerent mapping class group orbits.

2.3. Ribbon graphs. The main tool we will use in our counting arguments later on is
ribbon graphs. Ribbon graphs are graphs together with an orientation. An orientation is a
cyclic ordering of the edges emanating from each vertex of a graph. Here a graph is allowed
to have multiple edges and loops2. We note that writing down a careful deﬁnition of ribbon
graphs is surprisingly subtle. We will however content ourselves with the description given
above and refer to [16] for a rigorous deﬁnition.

A ribbon graph can be thickened into a ribbon surface, that is, an oriented surface with
boundary in such a way that the orientation of the surface corresponds to the cyclic
orderings of the half edges. In general we will not distinguish between ribbon graphs and
ribbon surfaces. We will write g(Γ) and b(Γ) for the genus and the number of boundary
components of Γ respectively.

The automorphism group of a ribbon graph Γ, denoted Aut (Γ), is the group of bijective
self maps of Γ that preserve the graph structure and the orientation of Γ. We stress that

2Some authors prefer the term multigraph for such a graph. We will however not make this distinction.

6

PATRICIA CAHN, FEDERICA FANONI AND BRAM PETRI

technically an automorphism is a pair of maps, one that sends vertices to vertices and
another one that sends edges to edges.

Also note that ribbon graph automorphisms extend to orientation preserving homeomor-
phisms of the corresponding ribbon surface.

Given a ribbon graph Γ, we will denote the boundary of the corresponding surface by
∂Γ. The set of connected components of ∂Γ will be denoted B(Γ) = {β1, . . . , βb(Γ)}. Note
that the restriction of a ribbon graph automorphism to the boundary of the corresponding
ribbon surface gives us a map

Aut (Γ) → SB(Γ) (cid:39) Sb(Γ)

where SB(Γ) denotes the group of permutations of the ﬁnite set B(Γ) and Sb(Γ) denotes
the symmetric group on b(Γ) letters. We will denote the image of this map by

Aut (∂Γ) = Im(cid:0)Aut (Γ) → SB(Γ)

(cid:1) .

2.4. Ribbon graphs coming from curves on surfaces. The reason we deﬁned ribbon
graphs is that we can associate ribbon graphs to curves on surfaces.

Given a generic curve a with self-intersections on Σg, we can associate a 4-valent ribbon
graph Γ(a) to it as follows. The vertices of Γ(a) are the self-intersections of a and the
edges the arcs between those self-intersections. The orientation at each vertex comes from
the orientation on Σg. The ribbon surface corresponding to Γ(a) is naturally embedded
in Σg as a regular neighborhood of a.

We note however that not all 4-valent ribbon graphs come from curves on surfaces. For
the set of isomorphism classes of those that do come from curves with k self-intersections
we write RC(k). This set naturally corresponds to the set of so-called Gauss diagams of
rank k; because we will not directly need to use those in this text we will restrict ourselves
to ribbon graphs. For an exposition on Gauss diagrams, see [23]. For enumerative results
on sets the related chord diagrams, see [22].

We have the following:

Lemma 7. If a and b are curves on Σg in minimal position that can be mapped to each
other by ambient isotopies of Σg and homeomorphisms of Σg then Γ(a) (cid:39) Γ(b) as ribbon
graphs.

Proof. Ambient isotopies and homeomorphisms send regular neighborhoods to regular
neighborhoods, so the ribbon surfaces associated to a and b are isotopic and thus Γ(a) (cid:39)
(cid:3)
Γ(b).

Note that this lemma implies that the ribbon graph of an isotopy class of curves, deﬁned
as the ribbon graph of a minimal representative of the class, is well deﬁned and is an
invariant of the mapping class group orbit of such a class.

Because of the existence of third Reidemeister moves, the ribbon graph is not well-deﬁned
within a given homotopy class. We do however have the following weaker statement:

Lemma 8. If a and b are curves on Σg that can be mapped to each other by ambient
homotopies of Σg and homeomorphisms of Σg and furthermore these curves contain no
disks in their complement then Γ(a) (cid:39) Γ(b) as ribbon graphs.

MAPPING CLASS GROUP ORBITS OF CURVES WITH SELF-INTERSECTIONS

7

Proof. Since there are no disks in the complement, we cannot perform third Reidemeister
moves. This means that by Theorem 6 that the curves can be mapped to each other by
(cid:3)
ambient isotopies and homeomorphisms of the surface and we can apply Lemma 8.

In order to be able to count mapping class group orbits of homotopy classes of curves, we
need a converse to this lemma. We will state everything for isotopy classes ﬁrst.

To an isotopy class of curves α on Σg we associate the triple

V (α) = (Γ(α), P (α), S(α))

where

• Γ(α) is the ribbon graph associated to a minimal representative a,
• P (α) = {p1, . . . , pn} is a partition of the set of boundary components of Γ(α)
such that the boundary components of every pi for the boundary of exactly one
connected component of Σg \ Γ(α), and
• S(α) = ((g1, b1), . . . , (gn, bn)) records the signatures of the surface attached to the

boundary components in pi for all i = 1, . . . , n.

We have already noted that Γ(α) is indeed an invariant of the isotopy class of α and
the same holds for the partition and the signatures of the surfaces, so the triple is well
deﬁned.

We have the following:

Lemma 9. Let α and β be free isotopy classes of curves. Then α and β lie in the same
mapping class group orbit if and only if Γ(α) (cid:39) Γ(β) and the data (P (β), S(β)) can be
obtained from (P (α), S(α)) by applying the isomorphism between these graphs to this data.

Proof. If α and β lie in the same mapping class group orbit, let a and b be minimal
representatives and φ an orientation preserving homeomorphism sending a to b. By
Lemma 7, Γ(a) (cid:39) Γ(b). Moreover, it is easy to check that (P (β), S(β)) can be obtained
from (P (α), S(α)) via φ.

Conversely, suppose a and b are minimal representatives of α and β respectively and let
g : Γ(α) → Γ(β) be the isomorphism given by hypothesis. This induces an orientation
preserving homeomorphism f between the ribbon surfaces of a and b, sending a to b.
The fact that the data (P (β), S(β)) can be obtained from ((P (α), S(α)) by applying f
means that Γ(α) and Γ(β) have homemorphic complementary components, say S1, . . . Sk
and S(cid:48)
i. Moreover, the
fact that P (β) and P (α) correspond via g implies that we can glue f, f1 . . . fk to get an
orientation preserving homeomorphism of Σg sending a to b. Note that we need to choose
the homeomorphisms fi to be orientation preserving in order to be able to glue them to
(cid:3)
f .

k, with orientation preserving homeomorphisms fi : Si → S(cid:48)

1, . . . S(cid:48)

For homotopy classes we have to add the ‘no-disk’ condition again:

Lemma 10. Let α and β be free homotopy classes of curves that have no disk in their
complement. Then α and β lie in the same mapping class group orbit if and only if
Γ(α) (cid:39) Γ(β) and the data (P (β), S(β)) can be obtained from (P (α), S(α)) by applying the
isomorphism between these graphs to this data.

8

PATRICIA CAHN, FEDERICA FANONI AND BRAM PETRI

Proof. Consider two minimal representatives a and b of α and β; by Theorem 6, they are
related by an isotopy and a sequence of Reidemeister moves. But since there is no disk
in the complement, there is no Reidemeister move that can be performed, so a and b are
(cid:3)
actually isotopic and we can apply Lemma 9.

3. Counting ribbon graph embeddings

3.1. Set up. Our ultimate goal is to understand the asymptotics of Ng,k, the number of
MCG(Σg)-orbits of free homotopy classes with k self-intersections on Σg. In this section
we will give upper and lower estimates on Ng,k.
Given a ribbon graph Γ ∈ RC(k), we deﬁne the following:

(Γ) of embeddings of Γ into Σg up to isotopy.

(Γ) overcounts Ng,k in two ways:

• we count isotopy classes instead of homotopy classes of curves, so, because of
third Reidemeister moves, multiple isotopy classes might correspond to the same
homotopy class;

• if we glue disks to some component of the ribbon surface associated to Γ to obtain

Σg, the curve corresponding to Γ may be not in minimal position on Σg.

On the other hand, there are minimal generic curves a such that one or more component
of Σg \ Γ(a) is a disk, so in general the ﬁrst inequality is strict.

(Γ) and N◦

3.2. Estimating N iso
g (Γ). We will count the total number of distinct (up to
homeomorphism and isotopy) ways to embed the ribbon surface corresponding to Γ on
Σg. Recall that the count Ng(isoΓ) includes all such embeddings, including non-minimal
ones.

To shorten notation, we will let (g0, b0) = (g(Γ), b(Γ)) denote the signature of the ribbon
surface corresponding to Γ.

Lemma 11. Suppose we have an embedding of the ribbon surface Γ in Σg, where

n(cid:71)

Then

Σg \ Γ =

n(cid:88)

i=1

bi = b0 and

n(cid:88)

gi = g + n − g0 − b0.

Note that the surfaces obtained by cutting along Γ can be homeomorphic to each other.

MAPPING CLASS GROUP ORBITS OF CURVES WITH SELF-INTERSECTIONS

Proof. The ﬁrst identity comes from the fact that the boundaries of the Σgi,bi are glued
to Γ. For the second identity we have

χ(Σg) = χ(Γ) +

χ(Σgi,bi).

n(cid:88)

From this we obtain

2 − 2g = 2 − 2g0 − b0 +

which gives

gb0−1
(b0 − 1)!

+ O(gb0−2)

Proof. We ﬁrst assume that the boundary components of Γ are distinguishable. By this
we mean that Aut (∂Γ) = {Id}.
Recall that B = B(Γ) = {β1, . . . , βb0} denotes the set of boundary components of Γ.
Because of our assumption on Aut (∂Γ), we can write

where the notation P |= B means that P = {p1, . . . , pn} is a set partition of B. The num-
ber N iso
(Γ, P ) counts the embeddings of Γ into Σg such that the boundary components
of in pi form the entire boundary of a single connected component Si in Σg \ Γ for all
i = 1, . . . , n.

g

Lemma 9 tells us that two such embeddings corresponding to a set partition P are home-
omorphic if and only if the genera of all the Si are the same (we again use our assumption
that Γ has no boundary permuting automorphisms here). This means that N iso
(Γ, P )
is equal to the number of ways to distribute the total genus g∗ = g + n − g0 − b0 over
the (distinguishable) n subsets in P . This number is also called the number of weak
compositions of g∗ into n parts and is equal to

g

(see for instance [21, p.15]). Because N iso

where S(b0, n) is a Stirling number of the second kind, which counts the number of set
partitions of B into n parts (see for instance [21, p.33]).

The sum above is a ﬁnite sum in our considerations: Γ is ﬁxed, hence so is b0. This means
that the terms that contribute to the asymptotics are only those of highest order in g (or
equivalently in g∗).

as g → ∞. Because S(b0, b0) = 1, this gives us the result in the case where Aut (∂Γ) =
{Id}.
In the case where Γ does have automorphisms that permute boundary components then
we over-count. For arbitrary P |= B, it is quite hard to work out the inﬂuence of the
autormorphisms. However, we are lucky and the only embeddings that contribute to the
asymptotics are those for which the ribbon graph disconnects Σg into b0 surfaces.

In fact, we will prove that we can also ignore those embeddings in which some of these
surfaces have the same signature. Note that in this case this is equivalent to having the
same genus, since in these embeddings every connected component of Σg \ Γ has exactly
one boundary component. Once we have this the proof is done, because every embedding
in which the genera of all the complementary surfaces are diﬀerent is counted exactly
|Aut (∂Γ)| times.
Let us denote by N iso
with b0 elements in which at least two of the genera are equal. We claim that

contributes to N iso
(Γ, rep) can be obtained by choosing a pair of boundary components

boundary components. This means that we can bound N iso

where the power b0−3 comes from the fact that once the genera of the ﬁrst b0−3 boundary

over-count because we did not worry about attaching disks. Note that we use Theorem

if there are no disks in the complement there is only one isotopy class in each

number of gluing involving a disk. Let us call this number Ng(Γ, Disk). So

In order to obtain a lower bound N◦

We have

g (Γ) = Ng(Γ, Disk)

Ng(Γ, Disk) ≤ b0(cid:88)

Ng(Γ, Disk, i)

where Ng(Γ, Disk, i) counts the number of gluings in which a disk is attached to the ith
boundary component βi (and possibly also to some of the other boundary components).
Because we are only after a bound on Ng(Γ, Disk, i), we will disregard the inﬂuence of
automorphisms. Using the exact same arguments as in Proposition 12, we obtain:

Ng(Γ, Disk, i) ≤ b0−1(cid:88)

4. The main theorem

We are now ready to determine the asymptotics of Ng,k. Before we state our result, we
deﬁne the set of planar ribbon graphs (that correspond to curves) with k vertices as

Furthermore, we write

Ck =

RCp(k) = {Γ ∈ RC(k)|g(Γ) = 0}.

(cid:88)

|Aut (∂Γ)|

Γ∈RCp(k)

Note that this is a constant in all our considerations. We have the following result:
Theorem 1. Let k ∈ N. We have

as g → ∞.

Ng,k ∼ Ck

gk+1

(k + 1)!

Proof. We will of course use the bounds from the previous section. Propositions 12 and
13 imply that N◦

g (Γ) ∼ N iso

Ng,k ∼ (cid:88)

(Γ) as g → ∞. So we obtain that

Γ∈RC(k)

The highest order terms come from the ribbon graphs Γ with the highest number of
boundary components. A simple Euler characteristic argument yields

b(Γ) = k + 2 − 2g(Γ).

This implies that b is maximal when g = 0. So for the asymptotics, we only need to sum
(cid:3)
over the planar ribbon graphs. Filling this in yields the result.

Note that simple curves technically do not fall within our scope, because to construct a
ribbon graph, we need self-intersections. However, using the annulus as the single ribbon
surface corresponding to a simple curve, all the arguments above work. As a ribbon
surface, the annulus has one automorphism, permuting the two boundary components.

Our reasoning also allows us to make certain probabilistic statements. Because the set of
MCG(Σg)-orbits of curves with k self-intersections is ﬁnite, it carries a natural probability
measure, coming from the counting measure. We will denote this measure by Pg.
Along the way we have proved the following:
Corollary 3. As g → ∞

Pg [A curve with k self-intersections has a disk in the complement] → 0

(cid:104)A curve with k self-intersections separates Σg into

(cid:105) → 1

k + 2 surfaces, all of diﬀerent signatures

and

Pg

Furthermore, it also follows from our arguments that if we let N iso
free isotopy classes of essential closed curves with k self-intersections, then:

g,k denote the number of

g,k ∼ Ng,k
N iso

for k ﬁxed an g → ∞. This implies a probablistic version of Baer’s theorem:
Corollary 2. Let k ∈ N. Then as g → ∞

(cid:104) The homotopy class of a curve with k self

(cid:105) → 1

intersections contains exactly one isotopy class

5. Geometric consequences

In this section we prove Corollary 4. This will be a direct consequence of Theorem 1 and
the following result by Basmajian:

Theorem 14 ([4], Theorems 1.1 and 1.2). Let X be a complete hyperbolic structure on
Σg and γ a geodesic on X with k ≥ 1 self-intersections. The length of γ on X satisﬁes

max{cX

√
k,

log(2k)} ≤ (cid:96)X (γ)

where cX is a continuous function on the moduli space of hyperbolic structures on Σg
tending to 0 as X approaches the boundary of this moduli space.

Given L > 0 and a hyperbolic surface X, deﬁne

Note that for ﬁxed L, a·(L) is a uniformly bounded function on the set of hyperbolic
surfaces. Namely,

A(L) = sup
X

{aX (L)} =

e4L

+ 1 < ∞

where the supremum is to be taken over all hyperbolic surfaces X of all possible genera.

Recall that N (X, L) denotes the number of MCG(Σg(X))-orbits of closed geodesics on X
that contain a curve of length at most L.

MAPPING CLASS GROUP ORBITS OF CURVES WITH SELF-INTERSECTIONS

13

We are now ready to prove the following:

Corollary 4. Let L > 0. There exists a constant C = C(L) > 0 such that for any
hyperbolic surface X

N (X, L) ≤ C · g(X)aX (L)

Proof. Theorem 14 tells us that an MCG(Σg)-orbit can only contain a curve of length
≤ L on X if it’s an orbit of curves with at most aX (L) − 1 self-intersections. This means
that:

N (X, L) ≤

Ng(X),k

aX (L)−1(cid:88)

k=0

Theorem 1 tells us that asymptotically this sum is dominated by its last term and that
furthermore there exists a constant C = C(L) such that

aX (L)−1(cid:88)

Ng(X),k ≤ C · g(X)aX (L)

where we have used the fact that aX (L) ≥ 1.

k=0

(cid:3)

Note that the fact that aX (L) is uniformly bounded for ﬁxed L gives us a polynomial
upper bound. On the other hand, if something is known about the hyperbolic structure
and cX can be controlled, then this bound becomes sharper.
