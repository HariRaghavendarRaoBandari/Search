Abstract: We consider an interacting theory of an inﬁnite tower of massless higher-spin
ﬁelds in ﬂat space with cubic vertices and their coupling constants found previously by
Metsaev. We compute the one-loop bubble diagram part of the self-energy of the spin
0 member of the tower by summing up all higher-spin loop contributions. We ﬁnd that
the result contains an exponentially UV divergent part and we discuss how it could be
cancelled by a tadpole contribution depending on yet to be determined quartic interaction
vertex. We also compute the tree-level four-scalar scattering amplitude due to all higher-
spin exchanges and discuss its inconsistency with the BCFW constructibility condition. We
comment on possible relation to similar computations in AdS background in connection
with AdS/CFT.

1 Introduction

A possibility of an interacting theory of an inﬁnite tower of massless higher spins in ﬂat
space is an old question with various no-go theorems prohibiting the existence of minimal
(low-derivative) couplings or long-distance interactions (see [1] for a review). At the same
time, non-trivial cubic vertices containing higher derivatives were constructed in the past
using various approaches in [2–16].1

1 How some constraints of no-go theorems may be avoided is discussed in [1]. The Coleman-Mandula
theorem that prohibits existence of higher spin conserved charges assumes ﬁnite number of particles of
mass below certain scale and analyticity of the amplitudes. Weinberg’s soft theorem [17] constrains a

The allowed cubic vertices ∂nφs1φs2φs3 have the number of derivatives n constrained by
s2 +s3−s1 ≤ n ≤ s2 +s3 +s1 (assuming s1 ≤ s2 ≤ s3). Remarkably, the coupling constants
in these vertices can be ﬁxed in terms of a single dimensional constant (cid:96) [6]. For example,
for the highest-derivative vertex one gets gs1s2s3 ∼ (cid:96)s1+s2+s3−1
(s1+s2+s3−1)! . Assuming that a Noether
deformation procedure can completely determine also the quartic and higher vertices one
may conjecture the existence of a theory containing an inﬁnite tower of massless Fronsdal
ﬁelds φs (s = 0, 1, 2, ...,∞) with an action depending on one dimensionless coupling g and
one dimensional parameter (cid:96) and having the following structure2

Here g controls the expansion in number of ﬁelds (and also loop expansion) while (cid:96) sets up
an eﬀective scale (i.e. it appears together with derivatives or momenta). Such a theory is
eﬀectively non-local as the number of derivatives is unbounded given that spins can take
any value up to inﬁnity.

One may wonder why such an unusual theory (assuming it indeed exists) may be of any
interest. One reason is that it may have hidden simplicity due to its large gauge (and global)

higher spin symmetry. For example, the free theory(cid:80)∞

(cid:82) d4x φs∂2φs turns out to have

s=0

zero total number of eﬀective dynamical degrees of freedom and thus a trivial partition
function Z = 1 [22].3 This is true if one uses a particular prescription of summation
over spins that should be consistent with underlying symmetry of the theory. One may
then expect that under such summation prescription other quantum corrections may also
be simple.4 For example, despite having a dimensional coupling (cid:96) the theory (1.1) may
actually be UV ﬁnite. This would be analogous to what happens in string theory viewed
as a collection of a few massless and an inﬁnite set of massive higher spin ﬁelds where
a particular prescription of summation over all contributions implied by the underlying
world-sheet formulation leads to the UV ﬁniteness of scattering amplitudes.5
theory with s-s(cid:48)-s(cid:48) couplings by imposing conditions on scattering amplitudes with at least one higher spin
particle on external lines which are equivalent to conservation of higher spin charges (which are higher than
quadratic in external momentum and thus allow only elastic scattering with permutations of momenta).
Constraints on cubic couplings based on the assumption of BCFW constructibility [18] applied to massless
4-point scattering amplitude [19–21] may not apply if one allows for some non-locality of the 4-point vertex
in a theory that contains inﬁnite sum over spins/derivatives.
It is likely that the condition of BCFW
constructibility is stronger than that of the existence of an interacting theory constructed from a free
theory via gauge symmetry deformation or Noether method.

2Here we consider the case of 4d space-time (so that φs are assumed to have dimension length−1) but

most of the discussion below will be true also in any dimension.

3In contrast to supersymmetric theories here Z = 1 even at ﬁnite temperature (all bosonic ﬁelds have

the same statistics) so closer analogy is with a topological ﬁeld theory.

4Similar simpliﬁcations were observed in conformal higher-spin theory [23, 22, 24]. The existence of
higher spin conserved charges may also have drastic consequences for the S-matrix with higher spin particles
on external lines (as in the case of integrable theories in 2 dimensions [25]).

5At the same time, it seems unlikely that (1.1) may be consistently related to a zero-tension limit of

Another motivation to study (1.1) is its possible relation to the massless higher-spin
theory in AdS space. The existence of the consistent cubic couplings (containing also low-
derivative or minimal-coupling parts and avoiding the no-go theorems) was ﬁrst pointed
out in [26, 27]. One may conjecture that elimination of an inﬁnite set of auxiliary ﬁelds
present in the non-linear Vasiliev’s equations [28, 29] expanded near the AdS vacuum may
lead to an action for the tower of physical massless Fronsdal ﬁelds that has a structure
similar to that of (1.1) (cf. [30–32])

Here L is the AdS radius and the cubic vertices now contain also the low-derivative
(“minimal-coupling”) tail of terms (e.g. n = 1, 2, ...). To understand a possible reason for
their presence let us imagine that the action (1.1) could admit a generalization to a curved
background where the ﬂat metric would be replaced by a curved one gab and the ﬂat deriva-
tives ∂a by the covariant ones ∇a. Then in addition to the cubic terms (cid:96)n−1∇nφs1φs2φs3
as in (1.1) with n ≥ s2 + s3 − s1 one could also have terms of the same dimension
with less derivatives but with extra powers of the curvature, (cid:96)n−1Rk∇n−2kφs1φs2φs3, i.e.
(cid:96)n−1L−2k∇n−2kφs1φs2φs3 in the case of the AdS space with R ∼ L−2. In the action (1.2)
corresponding to the Vasiliev-type theory there is just one dimensional scale, i.e. (cid:96) is ef-
fectively identiﬁed with the curvature scale L and thus the ﬂat space limit (L → ∞) is
formally singular.6

While a naive ﬂat-space limit that leads from (1.2) to (1.1) may not exist, there may
be still some formal procedure of relating the two actions in which these low-derivative
couplings would decouple and with L in (1.2) being eﬀectively replaced by another scale
(cid:96) in (1.1). Since the leading short-distance behaviour should be controlled by the highest
derivative terms, one may then expect that the UV properties of the ﬂat-space (1.1) and
the AdS (1.2) theories may be similar. Then the study of a simpler theory (1.1) may shed
some light on the properties of (1.2).

The deﬁnition of a quantum theory with an inﬁnite set of fundamental ﬁelds like the
one in (1.1) or (1.2) is a priori ambiguous as the sum of individual ﬁeld contributions over
all spins may be divergent. This ambiguity is to be ﬁxed in a way that is consistent with
preservation of underlying higher spin symmetry as was recently discussed in [33, 34, 23,
35–38, 24]. In particular, under a special summation prescription the free-ﬁeld partition
function of the AdS theory (1.2) is trivial, i.e. Z = 1 [34, 35], just as in the ﬂat space
theory (1.1) [22].

This deﬁnition should be consistent with the vectorial AdS/CFT duality [39–41] be-
tween the massless higher spin theory in AdSd+1 and singlet sector of the free U (N ) or

the bosonic string theory combined with a truncation to the leading Regge trajectory: zero-tension limit
does not appear to be well-deﬁned in ﬂat space and, moreover, the tower of ﬁelds on the leading Regge
trajectory may not lead to a consistent UV theory on its own.

6Here we assumed that the curved metric (e.g., ds2

AdS = du2 + e−u/Ldxmdxm) has a smooth ﬂat space
limit without need to rescale the coordinates. In general, one may contemplate taking a ﬂat space limit
that involves some singular rescalings of the ﬁelds, coordinates and coupling constants.

O(N ) scalar CFT in Rd which is also controlled by the underlying higher spin symmetry.
This duality was tested at the tree level for some 3-point functions [30, 42] which are essen-
tially ﬁxed by unbroken higher spin symmetry [43].7 Let us note that some cubic vertices
for the Fronsdal ﬁelds derived from the Vasiliev’s theory upon elimination of auxiliary ﬁelds
are formally divergent [30, 42, 32] and thus require additional deﬁnition/regularization even
before summation over all physical spins.

Alternatively, one can try to reconstruct the cubic and quartic action (1.2) (with
g2 = 1/N ) by requiring that it should reproduce the boundary CFT correlators at the tree
level [47–49] (for related earlier work see [50]). Then a crucial test of the duality will be
to check that all quantum corrections to the “on-shell” value of the eﬀective action of the
theory (1.2) should vanish since the correlators of conserved currents in the free boundary
CFT do not receive 1/N corrections, i.e. are given exactly by their large N values.8
Assuming that the matching of correlators at separated points may be extended also to
integrated correlators, this suggests, in particular, that the vacuum partition function of
the AdS theory (1.2) should vanish not just at the leading one-loop order [34] but also to
all orders in g = 1/

N expansion.

√

Another non-trivial quantum test would be the demonstration of the vanishing of the
1-loop correction to the spin s ﬁeld 2-point function – the 2-point functions or dimensions
of the currents in the boundary CFT should not be 1/N -corrected in the case of unbroken
higher spin symmetry. This “self-energy” correction is given by the sum of the two types of
one-loop Witten diagrams: the “bubble” diagram (with two bulk-to-bulk propagators and
two cubic vertices) and the “tadpole” diagram determined by the quartic vertex in (1.2).9
With this motivation in mind here we will address a simpler question about the one-
loop bubble-diagram part of the self-energy correction in the higher spin ﬂat space theory
(1.1). Certain features of the ﬂat-space result should be similar to the ones in the AdS
case, at least in what concerns the leading UV behaviour. Our aim will be to extract the
UV divergence of the bubble diagram and to see if it can be cancelled against a tadpole
contribution coming from (yet unknown) 4-point vertex.

For simplicity, we shall consider the case when only the scalar particle (spin 0 member
of the higher spin tower) appears on the two external lines of the self-energy diagram.
In this case the bubble graph contribution is determined by the 3-point vertex 0-s2-s3
(containing n = s2 + s3 derivatives) which is essentially unique. We shall use the explicit
value of its coeﬃcient ∼ (cid:96)s2+s3−1
(s2+s3−1)! found in [6] and perform the summation over all spins
in the loop.10 The one-loop diagram will then be quadratic in dimensionless coupling g

7Also, all n-point functions of the free CFT have been identiﬁed with suitable invariants in the Vasiliev

theory in [44–46].

8A priori it is possible that quantum corrections to the eﬀective action of the theory (1.2) could be
non-vanishing but having such special “local” form that they do not contribute to derivatives over the
boundary sources taken at separated points. At the same time, this seems unlikely as quantum corrections
should be controlled by the higher spin symmetry that should constrain also possible contact terms.

9Some one-loop corrections to propagators in AdS were computed previously for spin 2 in [51, 52] and
for higher spins in [53]. One-loop computations based on Mellin representation were performed in [54].
Related discussions from higher spin AdS/CFT perspective appeared in [55–58].

10This cubic vertex can be found, e.g., by requiring the gauge invariance of the full non-linear action to

– 4 –

in (1.1) and given by the virtual momentum integral with non-trivial dependence on the
product of (cid:96) with external momentum.

To ﬁnd the full result for the g2 correction to self-energy diagram one is to add also
the ghost-loop contribution and the tadpole graph contribution. The latter requires the
knowledge of the 0-0-s-s quartic vertex (and similar one for the ghosts). The problem
of determining quartic interactions of massless higher spins in ﬂat and AdS spaces was
addressed using diﬀerent approaches in, e.g., [63, 6, 14, 64–67, 48], but its full conclusive
solution is yet to be found. While being unable to determine the tadpole contribution
explicitly here we shall still comment on its expected UV behaviour required to cancel the
UV divergent part of the bubble graph. We shall also note that the tadpole contribution is
not expected to alter the non-trivial (non-analytic) external momentum dependence coming
from the bubble graph.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

In section 2 we shall deﬁne the free
Fronsdal action for totally symmetric massless higher spin ﬁelds in ﬂat d dimensions and
impose the de Donder gauge. In section 3 we shall discuss the structure of the 0-s2-s3 cubic
vertices required for subsequent computations. We shall also consider the leading term in
the deformation of the gauge transformations due to the presence of the cubic interactions
and thus determine the corresponding quadratic and cubic terms in the ghost action. In
section 4 we shall review the derivation of the higher spin propagator in the de Donder
gauge and describe the resulting Feynman rules.

Section 5 will be devoted to the computation of the tree-level 4-scalar scattering am-
plitude. We shall ﬁrst explicitly compute the exchange part of the amplitude and then
comment on possible contribution of the 4-scalar “contact” vertex. In section 6 we shall
compute the bubble diagram contribution to the one-loop scalar self-energy corrections and
discuss its UV behaviour. We shall then discuss a possibility that UV divergence of the
bubble diagram may be cancelled against a tadpole graph contribution determined by the
4-point vertex. Some concluding remarks will be made in section 7.

In Appendix A we shall explain the relation between the covariant cubic vertex we
use and the light-cone gauge cubic vertex in [6]. In Appendix B we shall discuss whether
these vertices are consistent with the BCFW constructibility condition (see also comments
at the end of section 5). Appendix C will contain some details of the computation of sums
over spins in section 6.

the lowest order in the coupling g. At this order the coupling constants of individual vertices for diﬀerent
spins are independent. By requiring gauge invariance to the next g2 order, these coupling constants can
all be expressed in terms of a unique dimensionful parameter (cid:96) as in (1.1). An equivalent analysis was
carried out in ﬂat 4d space in the light-cone approach in [6]. In AdS similar relations were found within the
Fradkin-Vasiliev approach [27, 59, 60] by imposing the Jacobi identity for the gauge symmetry deformations
[61, 62].

3 Cubic interaction vertices

In this section we shall present cubic vertices for the physical ﬁelds φs and the ghosts
corresponding to the de Donder gauge (2.10). To construct cubic vertices in the covariant
form one usually starts by specifying their traceless transverse parts. Then these vertices
can be completed to full-ﬂedged oﬀ-shell ones [13–16]. For our purposes it is not necessary
to face the diﬃculties inherent to general oﬀ-shell interactions as it suﬃces to know the
vertices in the de Donder gauge. Moreover, as here we will be interested in computing
diagrams with only spin 0 particles on external lines we may restrict consideration to cubic
vertices with one of the ﬁelds having s = 0. In this case it turns out that the traceless-
transverse vertices give already the consistent vertices in the de Donder gauge, i.e. do not
require any completion.

3.1 Deformation of the free action

Adding cubic interaction part S(3) to the free action S(2) and requiring gauge invariance
of the combined non-linear action gives at the ﬁrst non-trivial order the condition

δ(0)S(3) + δ(1)S(2) = 0 ,

(3.1)

where δ(1) is a deformation of the gauge transformation (2.8) which is linear in the ﬁelds
φs. The ﬁrst term in (3.1) thus vanishes modulo the free equations of motion (2.5), i.e.

δ(0)S(3) ≈ 0 .

(3.2)

Once the cubic vertex is found, the associated deformation of the gauge transformation
can be extracted from (3.1).

The traceless-transverse part of the cubic vertex involving the spin 0 ﬁeld and any two

other higher spin ﬁelds can be written as [13, 14, 16, 69]

(3.5)

This leading-order deformation analysis ﬁxes the structure of the cubic vertices but leaves
the coupling constants g0s2s3 in (3.3) undetermined. This happens because the gauge
invariance conditions (3.1), (3.2) are linear in the deformation S(3). To ﬁnd g0s2s3 one
needs to consider higher-order deformations and to solve analogous higher-order constraints
which become non-linear in the ﬁelds. At the next order one gets the condition

δ(0)S(4) + δ(1)S(3) + δ(2)S(2) = 0,

(3.6)

which involves quartic vertices S(4).

A conclusive analysis of higher-spin interactions in the covariant form at this quartic
order was not performed so far, but to ﬁx g0s2s3 we may make use of the result of Metsaev
[6] obtained in d = 4 in the light-cone gauge approach. Making the most general ansatz
for the cubic interaction vertex and requiring the closure of the Poincare algebra to the
g2 order it was found [6] that all cubic couplings can be expressed in terms of a single
parameter.
In Appendix A we will establish a dictionary between the light-cone cubic
vertices and the covariant ones in the de Donder gauge and show that the result of [6, 7]
when translated into the covariant language implies that

g0s2s3 = g

(cid:96)s2+s3−1

(s2 + s3 − 1)!

.

(3.7)

Here g is an overall dimensionless coupling counting the power of ﬁelds and (cid:96) is a unique
dimensional parameter (cf. (1.1)). Here g000 = 0, i.e. there is no cubic scalar self-coupling.
Remarkably, the same expression for the cubic couplings (3.7) appears also in the
action (1.2) for the massless higher spin ﬁelds in AdS4 which was reconstructed from the
condition of consistency with the vectorial AdS/CFT duality. Namely, in [55] it was noted
that g00s couplings (3.7) agree with their AdS counterparts reconstructed from the free
boundary CFT [48] and it was further conjectured that the agreement should hold also for
general trilinear couplings of higher-spin gauge ﬁelds. This was indeed conﬁrmed recently
in [49]. This gives hope that some relation between the AdS action (1.2) and the ﬂat space
one (1.1) may hold even beyond the cubic order (despite a naive ﬂat-space limit of (1.2)
being singular).12

12Let us also mention that instead of solving a full-ﬂedged version of (3.6) one may study a simpler
consequence of it: one may consider deformations of gauge transformations induced by a cubic vertex and
demand that they satisfy a generalised version of the Jacobi identity [4, 70]. In higher-spin theory in AdS
it was shown [61, 62] that under some natural assumptions the general solution to the Jacobi identity is
quite constraining. Then similarly to (3.7) this should allow one to express all non-Abelian cubic couplings
in terms of a single coupling constant (cid:96), as was shown in the light-cone gauge in [6, 7].

3.2 Deformation of gauge transformations

In addition to cubic interactions of the physical ﬁelds we need also to ﬁnd similar vertices
involving the ghost ﬁelds as these are required to compute the one-loop self-energy graphs.
To ﬁnd the ghost action corresponding to the de Donder gauge we need to know the
deformation of the free gauge transformations (2.8) induced by the presence of the cubic
vertex (3.3).13

This deformation may be found using (3.1).

In order to compensate for the term

The presence of ∂2

x1 in (3.5) indicates that the cubic vertex (3.3) also induces a non-
trivial transformation of the spin 0 ﬁeld (which was not transforming at the leading order
in (2.8)) with respect to the gauge symmetries of the higher spin ﬁelds. The explicit
knowledge of this transformation will not, however, be required for the computation of the
one-loop scalar self-energy below.

Let us remark on an ambiguity in the cubic vertex related to ﬁeld redeﬁnition freedom.
The perturbative deformation procedure of the free gauge theory always has an ambiguity
of additional local ﬁeld redeﬁnitions. Some preferred choice of basic ﬁelds may be selected

13Deformations of gauge transformations induced by cubic couplings of higher spin ﬁelds and the asso-
ciated gauge algebra deformations have been studied, in particular, in [4, 71–74]. However, due to certain
issues (such as possible non-trivial contributions from non traceless-transverse terms, ambiguity in ﬁeld
redeﬁnitions, etc.) these results cannot be directly used here.

– 9 –

(cid:90)

by the requirement of the most simple form of the full non-linear theory consistent with
manifest symmetries (cf. Einstein theory). Here we shall choose the “minimal” form (3.3)
of the cubic vertex which is universal for all spins. When solving the gauge invariance
condition (3.1) one usually ignores cubic vertices that vanish on the free equations of
motion. Such vertices are “fake” in the sense that they can be generated from the free
theory Lagrangian by ﬁeld redeﬁnitions. For example, in addition to the non-trivial vertex
(3.3) one may consider, e.g., for s2 = s3 = s

S(3)[φ0, φs, φs] ∼

ddx φ0(x) Rs(x) · Rs(x) ,

(3.12)
where Rs is the de Wit-Freedman curvature [75] which is manifestly invariant under the
linearized gauge transformations (2.8) (and thus does not induce any gauge symmetry
deformation, i.e. δ(1)φs = 0). This does not contradict (3.11) implying that the deformation
of the gauge symmetry is non-zero for s2 = s3. Indeed, one can show that (3.11) for s2 = s3
can be removed by a ﬁeld redeﬁnition.14

The local ﬁeld redeﬁnitions that preserve the asymptotic states should not, of course,
change the on-shell amplitudes. That means that the “contact” contribution of the “one-
shell trivial” 3-point vertex containing the free kinetic operator acting on one of the legs (i.e.
the one that can be removed by a ﬁeld redeﬁnition) to, e.g., the 4-point scattering amplitude
will be cancelled by the contribution of the 4-vertex produced by the ﬁeld redeﬁnition.

The propagator for the free Fronsdal ﬁeld in the de Donder gauge was originally found in
d = 4 in [68] and was later extended to any dimension d in [76]. For completeness, we shall

traceless ﬁelds νs and µs−2 as

The cubic vertex for physical ﬁelds can be easily obtained from (3.3)

(4.16)
where pij ≡ pi − pj and 2 is a symmetry factor.15 This vertex is non-trivial only when
s2 + s3 is even (A.20). Similarly, for the ghost vertex we ﬁnd from (3.15)

W(∂u2, ∂u3; p1, p2, p3) = ig0s2s3s2(−ip31 · ∂u2)s2−1(−ip12 · ∂u3)s3−1(−p12 · p3) .
15Such symmetry factor appears when the vertex contains two identical ﬁelds. In the considered case
spins s2 and s3 may be diﬀerent. However, eventually, we are going to sum over spins and both φs2 and
φs3 appear as particular members of two identical higher spin multiplets. Alternatively, this factor can be
understood by arguing that during summation over spins each unordered pair (s2, s3) is counted twice.

5 Tree-level 4-scalar scattering amplitude

In this section we shall compute the tree-level 4-scalar scattering amplitude due to exchange
of the tower of higher spin ﬁelds. For charged external scalar particles and arbitrary
coupling constants in the corresponding cubic vertex this was earlier discussed in [77].
Here we shall repeat the same computation in the case of a real scalar which is the s = 0
member of the tower of higher spin ﬁelds using the speciﬁc values of the cubic couplings
given by (3.7).

The important diﬀerence between the present case of a real scalar scattering and a
complex scalar one in [77] is that in the real scalar case all interactions with odd spins
vanish (cf. (3.3)). In the complex scalar case the odd spins contribute to the exchange
amplitude with the opposite sign compared to the even spins. The resulting sum over spins
contains terms with alternating signs which leads to an improved high energy behaviour
[77] compared to the real scalar scattering case, where all exchange contributions add up
with the same sign.16 Note that this remark applies to the full amplitude assuming the
“contact” 4-point vertex contribution does not alter the UV asymptotics of the amplitude
which need not be the case here (see discussion below).

due to the presence of the dimensionful parameter (cid:96).

An analogous behaviour is expected also for other spin s scattering amplitudes. Such an
exponential growth of the tree-level scattering amplitude in the high energy regime is an
indication of the presence of similar ultraviolet divergences in loop diagrams. Indeed, we
shall ﬁnd similar UV divergences in the one-loop self-energy bubble diagram contribution
discussed in the next section.
Let us note that despite

t arguments appearing in (5.9) the exchange am-
plitude is actually analytic in s, t. Indeed, the Bessel functions in (5.8) have expansion in
even powers of their arguments and, as a consequence, the sum of the two F -functions in
(5.9) has a convergent expansion in integer powers of s and t only. The appearance of a
non-analytic function ea

5.2 Comments on 4-vertex contribution

The full tree-level 4-point spin 0 scattering amplitude should also include the contribution
of the 4-point 0-0-0-0 vertex:

This vertex is expected to be eﬀectively non-local (i.e. may contain an inﬁnite series
of powers of derivatives) and may thus “soften” the large momentum behaviour of the
exchange diagram contribution.

While the precise form of the 4-scalar vertex in the ﬂat-space action (1.1) is presently
unknown, we may try to guess its form using an analogy with a similar term in the action
(1.2) of the massless higher-spin theory in AdS. The 0-0-0-0 term in the AdS action was
recently reconstructed [48] from the free boundary CFT data by assuming the AdS/CFT
correspondence. Replacing the AdS covariant derivatives by the ﬂat space ones in the
expression in [48] gives

Here c2j are numerical coeﬃcients and we introduced the parameter (cid:96) to balance the
dimensions.20 Given (5.13),(5.14) the contribution of the 4-vertex to the 4-scalar amplitude
may, in principle, cancel the exponential growth (5.12) of the exchange amplitude. For
example, choosing c2j in the form similar to the one they have in the AdS expression [48]

c2j =

[(2j − 1)!]2 ,

It is thus also expressed in terms of the Bessel functions as in (5.8),(5.9), i.e. has a similar
Regge behaviour as in (5.12).

In the case of higher-spin theory in AdS one may interpret the result for the tree-level
amplitude (that reproduces the free CFT 4-point correlator) as indicating a soft behaviour
in the UV. It was previously observed that the expressions for the Witten diagrams in AdS
written in the Mellin representation look similar to the scattering amplitudes for the same
processes in ﬂat space [54]. In particular, the contact interactions with 2n derivatives give
rise to the Mellin amplitudes given by polynomials of n-th degree in the Mellin variables
(which play the role of the AdS counterparts of the Mandelstam variables). The AdS
exchanges produce the Mellin amplitudes with poles associated to the dimensions of the
exchanged operators and their descendants. The total four point scattering amplitude
should have a similar structure to the Mellin amplitude for the 4-point correlator of spin
0 primary operator in the free O(N ) CFT. This amplitude is a distribution [79, 80] in the
sense that it is a certain combination of delta functions and hence it is zero everywhere
except certain speciﬁc values of the Mellin variables. This suggests that the total tree-level
4-scalar amplitude in ﬂat space may also be a distribution and thus should have a trivial
UV asymptotics.21

Finally, let us note that the cubic vertices (3.7) appear to be inconsistent with the
BCFW constructibility condition. This condition requires that the scattering amplitudes
20Note that the exact expression for f2j(z) in [48] does not have poles (in particular, is regular at z → 0),

so its ﬂat-space counterpart should also not contain an essential non-locality like 1

∂2 .

21Similar behaviour was found for the external scalar scattering amplitude in the conformal higher-spin

theory [24] (there the amplitude actually vanished for the physical values of the Mandelstam variables).

vanish under inﬁnite complex shifts of momenta [19]. Together with the assumption of ana-
lyticity22 this leads to certain recurrence relations which allow one to express any tree-level
amplitude in terms of the on-shell three-point ones. Applied to the four-scalar amplitude
that we have studied above this would allow one to determine the quartic scalar self-
coupling in terms of the cubic vertices (3.3),(3.7). However, the BCFW construction can
be applied only if the cubic vertices satisfy a certain non-trivial consistency condition, the
so called the four-particle test [19]. As we will show in Appendix B, the cubic vertices
(3.3),(3.7) fail to satisfy this test.

It is not clear a priori if the condition of BCFW constructibility should, in fact, apply
to an eﬀectively non-local theory like (1.1) containing inﬁnite number of higher-spin ﬁelds
with higher derivatives of any order in vertices. For example, the BCFW approach relies
on the assumption of the analyticity of the amplitudes. While perturbative amplitudes
reconstructed from higher spin vertices will be given by sums of integer powers of momenta
(i.e. are analytic before summation over spins) the sums over spins may not converge fast
enough. This did not happen for the exchange amplitude (5.9) discussed above but was the
case for the 4-scalar scattering in the conformal higher-spin theory [24] where the amplitude
was not analytic – was given by a distribution.

6 One-loop scalar self-energy correction

Let us now consider the spin 0 one-loop self-energy correction.
It is given by the sum
of the two parts – of bubble diagrams and of tadpole diagrams. Each of these contains
contributions from the physical higher spin loops and from the ghost loops:

Bubble diagrams:

Tadpole diagrams:

The bubble diagrams are straightforward to evaluate using the Feynman rules described
in section 4. The tadpole diagrams contain the physical 4-point 0-0-s-s vertices S(4) and
their ghost counterparts (determined by subleading gauge symmetry deformations δ(2)φ
quadratic in ﬁelds) which are not known at present. While we will not be able to compute
the tadpole diagram, the bubble diagram already provides an important information about
the self-energy contribution as it captures non-trivial part of its dependence on external
momenta. Indeed, the tadpole contribution is expected to be a rational function while the
bubble one should contain branch cuts in external complex momentum.

22If an analytic function vanishes at inﬁnity it can be reconstructed from poles and their residues.

Individual bubble diagrams

Let us start with the bubble diagram with two physical ﬁeld propagators in the loop. The
momenta of particles ingoing the left vertex will be denoted p1 for the external scalar and
p2 and p3 for the spin s2 and spin s3 ﬁelds. Similarly, the momenta ingoing the right vertex
will be p(cid:48)

homogeneous polynomial of degree s2 in u2 (cf. (4.5),(4.8)) the result of this contraction

to V3 = S[¯cs2−1, cs3−1, φ0] and V4 = S[¯cs3−1, cs2−1, φ0]. One can check that V1 = (−1)s2+s3 V4 and
V2 = (−1)s2+s3 V3, so that for s2 + s3=odd the ghost action vanishes.

6.3 UV divergences and regularization

Let us now discuss the UV divergence of Σ. There are at least two possible approaches:
(i) introduce an explicit momentum UV cutoﬀ, sum over spins and then take cutoﬀ to
inﬁnity, or (ii) ﬁrst drop all power divergences in each individual loop using the dimensional
regularization and then sum over spins.26

Following the ﬁrst approach, to isolate the UV divergence of the loop integral in (6.10)

let us consider the p → ∞, k=ﬁxed limit of the integrand. In this limit x
the leading singularity one may just set k = 0. The apparent x = y poles of the integrand
are spurious and one ﬁnds (see Appendix C)

(6.19)

Thus with this dimensional regularization prescription (where one discards all power diver-
gences before summation over spins) one ﬁnds that instead of an exponential divergence in
(6.13) the self-energy divergerges only logarithmically and, in particular, vanishes at zero
momentum, Σ(0) = 0, so that the spin 0 ﬁeld remains massless.

6.4 Comments on tadpole diagram contribution

One may wonder if the exponential divergence (6.13) may get cancelled upon adding the
tadpole diagram contribution Σtp(k2). As we have seen in section 5, the expected structure
of the 4-vertex (5.13) leads to a contribution to the 4-scalar tree-level scattering amplitude
that has similar exponential large momentum behaviour (5.16) as the exchange diagram
(5.12). One may thus expect that this 4-vertex contribution to the self-energy tadpole
diagram will also have an exponential UV behaviour similar to the one in (6.13).

Let us consider just a single virtual s = 0 ﬁeld contribution to the tadpole diagram
for which the knowledge of the 0-0-0-0 vertex (5.13) is suﬃcient. Computing the scalar
loop with two scalar external legs we then get the following estimate for its large virtual
momentum behaviour (using (5.14),(5.15), cf. (5.16))

Setting k = 0 to get the leading UV asymptotics we ﬁnd

Thus this tadpole diagram has a similar exponential UV behaviour as the bubble diagram
(6.10).

This gives hope that the UV divergence of the bubble diagram contribution may get
cancelled once all tadpole diagrams (for all spins propagating in the loop) are taken into
account.
Ideally, the sum of the bubble and tadpole contributions may be given by a
convergent momentum integral that will not require UV regularization and may actually

– 21 –

vanish.27 The same may be true also for the case of self-energy diagram with an arbitrary
spin s ﬁeld on external lines. Such a result is expected in the AdS higher-spin theory
dual to a boundary U (N ) or O(N ) scalar where a one-loop self-energy correction would
represent a 1/N correction to the 2-point function of conserved currents which should be
absent in a free theory (i.e. a theory with unbroken higher spin symmetry).

7 Concluding remarks

In this paper we have computed the one-loop bubble diagram correction to the scalar
propagator generated by interactions with an inﬁnite tower of higher-spin gauge ﬁelds in
ﬂat 4d space. One motivation was to investigate whether in higher-spin theories, similarly
to what happens in string theory, the summation over an inﬁnite number of spins may
make loop integrals ﬁnite in the ultraviolet. Another is that this may also be considered as
a simpliﬁed version of the analogous computation in the massless AdS higher-spin theory,
aiming to verify a remarkable prediction of the vectorial AdS/CFT duality that all loop
corrections in this higher-spin theory should vanish.

The explicit cubic coupling coeﬃcients (3.7) that we used were previously derived by
demanding consistency of higher-spin interactions to the subleading g2 order in the light-
cone approach [6]. We also used these coeﬃcients to compute the tree scattering amplitude
of the massless scalars due to the exchange of an inﬁnite tower of massless higher spins.
We found that this exchange amplitude has an exponential growth in the Regge limit,
suggesting singular UV behaviour in the loops. Indeed, the bubble diagram contribution
to the scalar self-energy (summed over all virtual spins propagating in the loop) was found
to be exponentially divergent at high energies.

Qualitatively, this happens because all contributions from diﬀerent spins (each of which
grows in the UV due to the presence of higher derivatives in the cubic vertex ) enter with
the same sign and thus the summation over spins cannot improve the ultraviolet behaviour.
The external spin 0 ﬁeld we were scattering is a member of the higher-spin tower, i.e. a
real scalar which couples via 0-0-s vertex only to even spin s ﬁelds.28

In addition to the exchange diagrams, the full tree-level 4-scalar amplitude should
contain also the contribution of the 4-point vertex. Similarly, besides the bubble diagrams,
the full one-loop self-energy correction should contain also the contributions of the tadpole

27The prescription where one ﬁrst combines all contributions together, sums over spins and only then
discusses the need for a UV regularization seems the most natural one. The application of dimensional
regularization to individual graphs may be objected as it may not commute with summation over spins.
(cid:82) d4p ((cid:96)2p2)n
p2(k−p)2 may be represented as a sum of divergent integrals

remaining n = 0 one having the logarithmic divergence.

28At the same time, if one considers the scattering of a complex scalar that couples also to odd spins
(with extra i in the vertex) one may get softer UV behaviour due to alternating signs of coeﬃcients in sum
over all spins [77]. It is not clear, however, if there is a consistent higher-spin theory (with complex scalars
being part of the spectrum) where this UV softening mechanism can be implemented also at the loop level.
In particular, it is not clear if similar alternating series may appear in the bubble diagrams depending on
cubic vertices with two higher spin ﬁelds.

diagrams. To compute these extra contributions requires the knowledge of quartic vertices
which are not fully understood at present. To get an idea of possible structure of 4-vertex
contributions we used the 4-scalar interaction term found in the AdS higher-spin theory
[48] and formally continued it to ﬂat space in the short distance limit. We found that
it leads, indeed, to similar UV behaviour as the tree-level exchange diagrams and also
to similar tadpole momentum integrals as appear in the bubble diagram. There is thus
a potential possibility of cancellation of UV divergences in the full one-loop self-energy
correction. This is what is to happen in the AdS higher-spin theory dual to a boundary
CFT and would be in line with the expectation that the UV behaviour in the ﬂat space
and AdS theories should be similar.

corresponds to setting to zero all the components of the oﬀ-shell ﬁeld φa(s) that have at
least one upper “+” index

φ+−(n)I(s−n−1) = 0 .

(A.3)

– 23 –

Here n is the number of “−” indices and the remaining s− n− 1 indices are the transverse
ones I = (x, ¯x). In the light-cone gauge approach one usually assumes that derivatives ∂+
of all ﬁelds and gauge parameters are non-vanishing, i.e. one can divide by ∂+.29

Let us review the consequences of this gauge condition when combined with partial
set of the equations of motion (2.7) that allow one to express all of the components of the
Fronsdal ﬁeld in terms of just two independent ones. The components of e.o.m. (2.7) with
two “+” indices give

∂+∂+φm

ma(s−2) = 0 ⇒ φm

ma(s−2) = 0 ,

i.e. φI

Ia(s−2) = 0 .

(A.4)

This implies that there are only two non-vanishing components of φI(s)

ϕs ≡ φx(s) ,

¯ϕs ≡ φ¯x(s) .

The components of (2.7) with one “+” index give

∂+∂mφma(s−1) = 0 ⇒ ∂mφma(s−1) = 0 ,

so the ﬁeld is also transverse. Special cases of (A.6) give

(A.5)

(A.6)

φ−I(s−1) =

∂J

∂+ φJI(s−1) , φ−−I(s−2) =

∂J

∂+ φ−JI(s−2) , φ−−I(s−2) =

∂J ∂J

(∂+)2 φJJI(s−2).

Proceeding in the same manner one gets
φ−(k)I(s−k) =

1

(∂+)k (∂J )kφJ(k)I(s−k).

(A.7)

(A.8)

Thus there are only two on-shell independent components of the d = 4 Fronsdal ﬁeld in
the light-cone gauge – the two helicity ﬁelds (A.5). The equations of motion for them have
the standard ∂a∂a = (cid:3) kinetic term, i.e. follow from the action30

A.2 Cubic interactions

One imposes the same light-cone gauge (A.3) also at the interacting level.
Interactions
deform the free equations in a way that (A.4), (A.6), (A.8) now hold only up to terms
linear in the coupling constant, e.g.,

ma(s−2) = O(g) ,

φm

∂mφma(s−1) = O(g) .

(A.10)

These equations should be again used to express all of the auxiliary components of φs in
terms of the two dynamical helicity ﬁelds ϕs and ¯ϕs. The elimination of the auxiliary ﬁelds

29Inverse powers of ∂+ need not be considered as indication of genuine non-localities but originate from

solution of on-shell constraints.

30It is interesting to note the light-cone gauge action for free Fronsdal ﬁelds in AdS4 also has the same
form as (A.9) [81], i.e. there are no extra “mass” terms present in the covariant expression (such terms
appear though in d > 4).

generates higher powers of ϕs and ¯ϕs even from the quadratic action but they contribute
only to quartic and higher order interactions. Indeed, noting that except for the ∂2
x-term
all other terms in the free action (2.2) are at least bilinear in traces and divergences we
conclude that

Thus to ﬁnd the cubic vertices for ϕs ﬁeld in the light-cone gauge from those in the covariant
approach one just needs to plug (A.3)-(A.8) into the covariant cubic action.

Let us start with the traceless-transverse part of the highest derivative cubic vertex in

(A.18)

where g is an overall coupling constant and (cid:96) is an arbitrary dimension-length parameter.
Let us note that the vertex (A.12) has the following symmetry under the exchange of

any two arguments

S(3)[φs1, φs2, φs3] = (−1)s1+s2+s3S(3)[φs2, φs1, φs3] .

(A.19)

To get a complete cubic interaction, this vertex has to be summed over all ﬁelds and this
implicitly symmetrizes it over its arguments. This implies that the cubic vertex (A.12)
contributes under summation over all spins only if the total spin of the ﬁelds is even, i.e.
we may assume that the vertex with the total spin being odd may be eﬀectively set to zero

S(3)[φs1, φs2, φs3] = 0

if

s1 + s2 + s3 = odd .

B Test of BCFW constructibility condition

In this Appendix we shall discuss if the above higher spin cubic vertices can be used to
derive the quartic ones within the BCFW framework, i.e.
if the BCFW constructibility
condition is satisﬁed (cf. [19, 20]).

Let us consider a formal shift of two momenta

pi → pi(w) = pi + wq ,

pj → pj(w) = pj − wq ,

where w is a complex number and the vector q satisﬁes

q2 = 0 ,

q · pi = 0 ,

q · pj = 0 .

(B.1)

(B.2)

The BCFW constructibility condition [19] is that under such shift the total 4-point ampli-
tude should vanish in the limit w → ∞,

ˆA(w) = 0 .

lim
w→∞

(B.3)

Then assuming ˆA(w) is analytic it may have only poles at ﬁnite values of w. These
poles should correspond to the values of w for which the internal propagators that involve

33The result (A.18) was derived in [6] for the special case when all spins entering the vertex are even
and the more general case (with symmetric/antisymmetric internal indices on even/odd spin ﬁeldsφs) was
considered in [7]. We shall assume that (A.17) holds for all values of the spins.

shifted momenta go on-shell. The residues at these poles are given by products of on-shell
amplitudes resulting from the original one after cutting the propagator that goes on-shell
under the shift. Using analyticity of the shifted amplitude A(w) as a function of w, one
can then recursively express it in terms of the products of on-shell three-point amplitudes.
Let us apply these considerations to the tree-level four-scalar amplitude discussed in
section 5. Under the shift (B.1) applied to p1 and p2 in (5.1) we ﬁnd for the Mandelstam
variables in (5.2)

s(w) = s,

t(w) = t + w∆,

u(w) = u − w∆,

∆ ≡ −2q · p(cid:48)
1 .

(B.4)

Then the constructibility condition (B.3) implies that the total 4-scalar amplitude contain-
ing the exchange and “contact” (4-vertex) contributions

ˆA(s, t, u) = ˆAexch(s, t, u) + Acont(s, t, u) ,

(B.5)
should vanish at t → ∞. The total exchange part (5.10) of the 4-point amplitude corre-
sponding to the s-channel expression in (5.9),(5.8) is

(B.6)

To satisfy the constructibility condition, the contact contribution should cancel the expo-
nential singularity (5.12) of this exchange amplitude (B.6) at t → ∞. Given that F (z) in
(5.8) is an entire function, then (under a natural assumption that “contact” contribution
should not introduce new poles) the only remaining singularities of (B.6) will be poles at
t = 0 and t = −s. Keeping only the contributions from these ﬁnite poles (as required by
the assumption of BCFW constructibility), the total amplitude would then be

ˆA(cid:48)(s, t, u) = −i

s

t(s + t)

F (2s) ,

(B.7)

where we used that F (z) = F (−z) (see (5.8)). At the same time, applying the BCFW
shift (B.1) to the momenta p1 and p(cid:48)
1 in (5.1) and assuming a similar large w singularity
cancellation due to the contact term contribution we get instead

ˆA(cid:48)(cid:48)(s, t, u) = −i

(B.8)

The two expressions (B.7) and (B.8) could agree provided F (z) = c

We are thus led to the conclusion that the cubic vertices (3.3) with the couplings (3.7)
which led to the exchange amplitude (5.9) are inconsistent with the condition of BCFW
constructibility.
