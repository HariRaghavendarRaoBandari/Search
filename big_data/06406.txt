ABSTRACT
We present the ﬁrst calculation of the cross-correlation between three-dimensional cosmic
shear and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (iSW) eﬀect. Both signals are combined in a single
formalism, which permits the computation of the full covariance matrix. In order to avoid
the uncertainties presented by the non-linear evolution of the matter power spectrum and
intrinsic alignments of galaxies, our analysis is restricted to large scales, i.e. multipoles below
(cid:96) = 1000. We demonstrate in a Fisher analysis that this reduction compared to other studies of
three-dimensional weak lensing extending to smaller scales is compensated by the information
that is gained if the additional iSW signal and in particular its cross-correlation with lensing
data are considered. Given the observational standards of upcoming weak lensing surveys like
Euclid, marginal errors on cosmological parameters decrease by ten per cent compared to a
cosmic shear experiment if both types of information are combined without a CMB prior.
Once the constraining power of CMB data is added, the improvement becomes marginal.
Key words: gravitational lensing: weak – cosmological parameters – large-scale structure of
Universe.

INTRODUCTION

Gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure of the Universe
gives rise to the cosmic shear ﬁeld, the statistics of which probe the
matter power spectrum and its time evolution as well as spacetime
geometry. The distortion of a galaxy image depends on the pro-
jected mass along the light path, and therefore varies with the di-
rection of the line-of-sight, i.e. the position of the galaxy on the sky.
If galaxy ellipticities are measured across large ﬁelds, spatial pat-
terns can be analysed and statistics of the shear ﬁeld extracted. The
sensitivity to cosmological parameters was highlighted by Villum-
sen (1996); Bernardeau et al. (1997); Kaiser (1998); van Waerbeke
et al. (1999); Huterer (2002). In addition, the shear imprinted on
a galaxy image depends on the distance of the source: the line-of-
sight is longer for more remote galaxies, and the diﬀerent geomet-
ric arrangement alters the lensing eﬃciency of foreground struc-
tures. If the shear is treated as a three-dimensional variable, it can
constrain the distribution and growth of structures as well as the
distance-redshift relation. Fully three-dimensional treatments were
introduced by Heavens (2003) and further developed and applied
by Castro et al. (2005); Heavens et al. (2006); Kitching et al. (2007,
2011); Ayaita et al. (2012); Grassi & Schäfer (2014); Kitching et al.
(2014). To exploit the full spatial dependence, however, adequate
redshift measurements are required, which have only recently be-
gun to be available. In absence of such data, only the statistics of
the two-dimensional shear ﬁeld are accessible (Jain & Seljak 1997;

Takada & Jain 2002, 2003; Munshi & Kilbinger 2006; Jee et al.
2013; Kilbinger et al. 2013). Observables are constructed from a
projection of the lensing signal along the line-of-sight. In the course
of this projection, however, information about the redshift evolu-
tion is inevitably lost. As a compromise, source galaxies may be
assigned to bins according to their estimated redshifts. In each bin
a conventional two-dimensional analysis can be carried out; the
range of the projection, however, is much smaller, and the corre-
lations between signals in diﬀerent redshift bins put constraints on
the time evolution. This stacking approach has been termed ‘to-
mography’ (Hu 1999; Takada & White 2004; Simon et al. 2004;
Takada & Jain 2004; Hollenstein et al. 2009; Kilbinger et al. 2009;
Schäfer & Heisenberg 2012; Heymans et al. 2013). Several authors
have focused in particular on the potential of weak lensing to con-
strain dark energy (Jain & Taylor 2003; Bernstein & Jain 2004;
Hannestad et al. 2006; Amendola et al. 2008; Huterer 2010), lead-
ing to slighly weaker constraints compared to 3d-methods.

Most recently cross-correlations between the cosmic mi-
crowave background (CMB) and cosmic shear have come into fo-
cus. Like the light from distant galaxies, the CMB is deﬂected by
the large-scale structure, leading to a remapping of the tempera-
ture distribution (Lewis & Challinor 2006); in contrast to cosmic
shear, only a single source plane (the surface of last scattering) is in-
volved. Cross-correlations between two-dimensional cosmic shear
maps and CMB lensing were measured for the ﬁrst time by Hand
et al. (2015). Troxel & Ishak (2014) and Hall & Taylor (2014) in-
vestigated the inﬂuence of intrinsic alignments on this measure-
ment. Kitching et al. (2015) presented a formalism combining the

three-dimensional galaxy ellipticity ﬁeld and the CMB, considering
the temperature, deﬂection and polarisation ﬁelds. They provided
error forecasts for cosmological parameters based on the individ-
ual data sets and the combination. Expected constraints on the dark
energy equation of state were shown to improve by 10–15 per cent
when correlations between weak lensing of galaxies and the CMB
deﬂection were considered.

We study cross-correlations between cosmic shear and the in-
tegrated Sachs-Wolfe (iSW) eﬀect (see the review by Nishizawa
2014). Photons crossing a time-evolving potential experience a
net frequency shift, reﬂected in a small change of the CMB tem-
perature. To disentangle the ﬂuctuations from other sources of
anisotropy despite their small magnitude, the cross-correlation be-
tween the CMB temperature and a suitable tracer is measured
(Cooray 2002). Such a quantity should mark the potential wells,
which give rise to the frequency shifts. Detections have been based
on the X-ray background (Boughn & Crittenden 2004; Gaztañaga
et al. 2006), the galaxy density in various ﬁlters (Fosalba et al.
2003; Padmanabhan et al. 2005; Vielva et al. 2006; McEwen et al.
2007; Rassat et al. 2007; Giannantonio et al. 2008) and the distri-
butions of radio sources (Boughn & Crittenden 2004; Pietrobon
et al. 2006; Raccanelli et al. 2008) and quasars (Giannantonio
et al. 2006). Recently the iSW eﬀect was measured from CMB
data alone through the cross-correlation of temperature and lens-
ing maps (Planck Collaboration 2015). The eﬀect vanishes in the
linear regime of structure growth during matter domination, so that
observations probe the relatively late times at which the dark energy
contribution to the density becomes appreciable. This cosmologi-
cal sensitivity was demonstrated by Vielva et al. (2006); Pietrobon
et al. (2006); McEwen et al. (2007); Giannantonio et al. (2008);
Ho et al. (2008); Giannantonio et al. (2014); Planck Collaboration
(2015); Majerotto et al. (2016).

Like cosmic shear, the iSW eﬀect traces potential wells pro-
jected along the line-of-sight, albeit with a diﬀerent radial weight
function, and therefore correlations between the two measurements
are expected. The iSW eﬀect can in fact be described as a second or-
der lensing phenomenon by relating it to the gravitomagnetic vector
potentials, as demonstrated by Schäfer & Bartelmann (2006) (see
also Merkel & Schäfer 2013a). We show how information from
both eﬀects can be combined in a single formalism, tying into the
three-dimensional treatment of weak lensing. The 3d-method pre-
sented here combines iSW-lensing correlations (Nishizawa et al.
2008; Lee 2015) in a redshift-resolved way, improving over tomo-
graphic methods (Ho et al. 2008; Jürgens & Schäfer 2012).

The shear tensor γ(χ, ˆn) is deﬁned as the second ð-derivative of the

into spherical waves on Φ(χ, ˆn) yields the expression

In contrast to the coupling of radial modes due to the lens-

errors, we neglect couplings between the angular wave numbers (cid:96)

forecasts with a factor (cid:112) fsky. Methods for dealing with survey ge-

ometry in the context of the 3dWL-formalism are being developed
(Leistedt et al. 2015). The coupling introduces correlations between
otherwise uncorrelated modes which reﬂect the measurement pro-
cesses and the loss of information due to imperfections that come
with it.

The weak lensing formalism is based on the assumption that
the observed ellipticity  of a galaxy is the sum of the shear γ and
its intrinsic ellipticity s. The intrinsic shapes of source galaxies are
therefore a source of noise, given by

The intrinsic ellipticity dispersion σ is deﬁned by (cid:104)|s|2(cid:105) = σ2

assume a value of σ = 0.3 (cf. Heavens 2003). This expression
for the noise holds only if the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies are
uncorrelated, i.e. in absence of intrinsic alignments (see Sec. 5).

and that matter-radiation equality occurs before decoupling, the ob-
served iSW eﬀect must reﬂect the comparatively recent rise in the
dark energy contribution. It is therefore an excellent probe for the
equation of state of dark energy (e.g. Scranton et al. 2003; Nolta
et al. 2004; Cabré et al. 2006; Vielva et al. 2006; McEwen et al.
2007). An alternative probe of structure formation at high redshifts
is CMB lensing, which collects information about the weak lensing
deﬂection ﬁeld and the amplitude of structures at redshifts above
one, thereby adding information about dark energy (Kitching et al.
2015). CMB lensing can be measured through its homogeneity-
breaking properties by estimating correlations between modes of
the temperature or polarisation ﬁeld at diﬀerent multipoles. Typical
signal strengths are larger than the iSW eﬀect, but the measurement
has more complicated noise properties compared to the straight-
forward cosmic variance inherent to iSW signals (Hu 2001; Hu &
Okamoto 2002).

2.3 Covariance matrix

In the 3d-approach, the results for the auto-correlation of the iSW
eﬀect and its cross-correlation with cosmic shear are as follows:

(16)

(17)

2.2

iSW signal

The iSW eﬀect arises as CMB photons propagate through time-
evolving gravitational potentials. The diﬀerence between the
blueshift experienced by a photon entering a gravitational well and
the redshift of the exiting photon results in a net frequency change
(e.g. Hu & Sugiyama 1994). The sum of these frequency changes
along the entire path of the photon causes a temperature shift,
which varies with direction according to the evolution of struc-
tures along the particular line-of-sight. Since only the integrated
frequency change can be observed, the eﬀect contains no distance
information and is analysed only in terms of angular modes. Ob-
servations are limited to large scales, as the power spectrum of the
gravitational potential is proportional to k−4Pδ(k) and thus falls oﬀ
like k−7 on small scales.

The relative temperature change due to the iSW eﬀect is given

by the line of sight-integral

Here the derivative is taken with respect to conformal time η; it can
be reparametrized using dη = dt/a = da/a2H(a). Transforming
from position space to modes Φ(cid:96)m(k; χ) and using Poisson’s equa-
tion to introduce the density contrast δ(cid:96)m(k; χ), one arrives at the
following expression for the amplitude of the iSW eﬀect:

ing the matter-dominated epoch: In an Einstein-de-Sitter universe
with Ωm = 1, the growth of overdensities in the linear regime is
proportional to the scale factor, δ ∼ a, across all scales. For the
linear regime the derivative appearing in Eq. (14) simpliﬁes to

As the iSW eﬀect manifests itself in changes in the CMB tem-
perature, the noise term is simply given by the CMB spectrum it-
self, CΘΘ
. Since there are no correlations between the temperature
ﬂuctuations or the instrumental noise of the CMB observation and
the shape noise of weak lensing, no noise term needs to be added to
the cross-covariance. Due to these peculiarities, the main limitation
for the iSW eﬀect is cosmic variance.

For the full set of iSW and cosmic shear data, the covariance
matrix for a given (cid:96)-mode then has the following block structure,
with the cross-correlation forming a row- and column-vector in-
dexed by wave number:

Ultimately we will combine the weak lensing spectrum including
the iSW cross-correlation with a CMB prior: This eﬀectively cor-
with the full CMB spectrum, and ex-
responds to replacing
tending it by inclusion of CMB polarisation spectra. This is true in
the limit of no further correlations between the CMB and the weak
lensing structure.

3 CROSS-SPECTRA

3.1 Observational scenarios

We consider two weak lensing surveys. In the framework of the
Dark Energy Task Force (Albrecht et al. 2006) these represent re-
search stages III and IV. The speciﬁcations for the stage III ex-
periment are based on the design of the ground-based Dark En-
ergy Survey (DES; The Dark Energy Survey Collaboration 2005)
with a ﬁeld size of Ωsky = 5 × 103 deg2 and a galaxy density
of n0 = 12 arcmin−2 around a median redshift of zm = 0.7. For the
stage IV survey we choose the parameters Ωsky = 2×104 deg2, n0 =
40 arcmin−2 and zm = 0.9 reﬂecting the goals for the upcoming
space-based Euclid mission (Laureijs et al. 2011). In the following
we refer to these survey designs either by their stage or as ‘DES-
like/Euclid-like’. For the source distribution we follow Baugh &
Efstathiou (1993) and choose the shape

where zm is the median redshift of the survey. The distribution is
normalised to match the observed redshift-integrated source den-
sity n0. Redshift estimates are assumed to be unbiased with a Gaus-
sian variance,

with σ(z) = σz(1 + z). We set σz = 0.05 (0.03) for the stage III
(IV) survey. Catastrophic outliers (as investigated by Abdalla et al.
2008) are not contained in the Gaussian ansatz.

Some care must be taken in choosing the maximum wave
numbers. The description presented here is only valid for modes
which evolve in the linear regime; moreover, Merkel & Schäfer
(2013b) showed for the 3d-formalism that the relative contribution
of intrinsic alignments (see Sec. 5) to the covariance increases with
the multipole order, in particular for cross-correlations between in-
trinsic alignments and weak lensing. Realising that the linear ap-
proximation breaks down when the density contrast approaches
unity, one can estimate the scale or equivalently wave number knl
where nonlinear corrections become appreciable. Typically, knl is
found to be about 0.3 h Mpc−1 today (e.g. Peacock & Dodds 1996;
Smith et al. 2003). Limber’s approximation (Limber 1953, 1954)
then establishes a link to multipole orders (cid:96): if an observable is
projected onto the sphere with a narrow weight function centred on
the radius R, the multipole (cid:96) of the angular spectrum reﬂects the
three-dimensional power at k (cid:39) (cid:96)/R. Given a survey depth of the
order of 1–2 h−1 Gpc we restrict the analysis to (cid:96)max = 1000, avoid-
ing the uncertainties of non-linear growth and limiting the numeri-
cal expense, and include 500 radial modes up to kmax = 1 h Mpc−1;
while the evolution may be mildly non-linear for the smallest ra-
dial modes, the main contribution to the highest multipole (cid:96)max
comes from somewhat lower k-values (cf. Heavens 2003; Castro
et al. 2005). We discuss the impact of non-linear structure growth
in Sec. 5. The iSW signal is added for multipoles up to (cid:96) = 40; from
the results in Planck Collaboration (2014b) and Planck Collabora-
tion (2015) it is evident that contributions from smaller scales are
negligible.

It follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality that −1 ≤ r(cid:96)(k) ≤ 1.
Values of the correlation coeﬃcient r(cid:96)(k) for cosmic shear and
the iSW eﬀect are plotted in Fig. 1. Note that the negative sign
mainly reﬂects the deﬁnition of the temperature ﬂuctuation associ-
ated with the iSW eﬀect. Finite correlations clearly exist between
the two signals: In the limit kR (cid:28) (cid:96) (where R again stands for
the survey depth) r(cid:96)(k) is close to −1, implying that corresponding
lensing modes contain little independent information compared to
the multipole (cid:96) of the iSW eﬀect. For kR (cid:29) (cid:96), in contrast, corre-
lations nearly vanish. Cosmic shear modes with large radial wave
numbers probe small scales and are therefore only weakly corre-
lated with the iSW signal, which is restricted to the low multipoles.
Given this cross-correlation proﬁle, independent information can
be gained from the combination of the two data sets, in particular
from the low multipoles.

The choice of this estimator is motivated by the Fisher matrix ap-
proach (see Sec. 4.1 below). S (cid:96) denotes the noise-free covariance
matrix. The sky coverage fsky = Ωsky/(4π) reﬂects the reduced in-
formation content of a limited ﬁeld compared to a full-sky survey.
We plot the result for both surveys in Fig. 2, using the shorthand
notation Σ(≤ (cid:96)) for the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio up to the
maximum multipole order (cid:96), which corresponds to truncating the
sum in equation (23) at this value. We also plot the summands to
illustrate the contributions of individual (cid:96)-modes.

Comparing the two surveys described in Sec. 3.1 we ﬁnd that
the overall signal-to-noise ratios up to the maximum multipole or-
der (cid:96)max = 1000 diﬀer roughly by a factor of four. This is close

for the case that the total likelihood factorises in terms of the wave
numbers (cid:96) and m, with a number 2(cid:96) + 1 of statistically independent
m-modes for each (cid:96). The assumption of a Gaussian likelihood is
justiﬁed for strong signals such as weak lensing or the spectrum of
CMB anisotropies with models of the complexity of wCDM, which
has been veriﬁed through comparisons with MCMC evaluations of
the likelihood L (Wolz et al. 2012).

4.2 Error forecasts

We forecast cosmological parameter errors for the following com-
binations of data sets: ‘3dWL’ denotes a cosmic shear survey; the
abbreviation ‘3dWL+iSW’ stands for independent weak lensing
and iSW experiments, for which cross-correlations are ignored and
the Fisher matrices are simply added; ‘3dWL×iSW’ indicates that
the covariance between the two data sets is included. We also gen-
erate a CMB prior according to the prescription given by Perotto
et al. (2006), considering the auto- and cross-correlations of the
temperature and E-modes of the polarisation in a Planck-like ex-
periment, and add it to all of the above combinations. The ﬁducial
cosmology is a ΛCDM model with the matter density Ωm = 0.314,
ﬂuctuation amplitude σ8 = 0.834, baryon density Ωb = 0.0486,
spectral index ns = 0.962 and Hubble parameter h = 0.674
(Planck Collaboration 2014a). We consider a dark energy com-
ponent with an equation of state described by the parametriza-
tion w(a) = w0 + wa(1 − a), as suggested by Chevallier & Polarski
(2001) and Linder (2003). Matter power spectra are calculated us-
ing the cosmic linear anisotropy solving system1 (class; Blas et al.
2011). The marginal 1-σ errors are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
Also included is the ﬁgure-of-merit for dark energy (abbreviated
‘FOM’), which measures the statistical power of the survey design
to test the null hypothesis of a cosmological constant. We adopt the
deﬁnition by Albrecht et al. (2009):

det(F−1)w0wa

FOM =
(26)
Here (F−1)w0wa denotes the 2 × 2-submatrix of the inverse of the
Fisher matrix. The FOM given by equation (26) is inversely pro-
portional to the area of the conﬁdence ellipse in the w0-wa plane,
so that constraints on the equation of state improve with increasing
FOM (Amara & Kitching 2011).

Table 1 shows that constraints are generally poor for the
stage III experiment, implying that it is not possible to constrain
such a number of parameters simultaneously for the given survey
design. However, it is worth noting that improvements between 20
and 50 per cent in the marginal errors on Ωm, σ8, w0 and wa are
achieved when iSW data are added, and the ﬁgure-of-merit more
than doubles. The inﬂuence on Ωb, ns and h is much weaker, which
is hardly unexpected, as these parameters only aﬀect the shape of
the matter power spectrum and degeneracies cannot be broken by
additional iSW information. Error ellipses for all parameter pairs,
obtained from cosmic shear alone and the full information, respec-
If correlations between lensing and
tively, are shown in Fig. 3.

to the scaling of Poisson noise with the square root of the num-
ber of sources, which is proportional to the ﬁeld size Ωsky (or sky
coverage fsky) and the projected source density n0. The exact re-
sult reﬂects additional diﬀerences, such as the shape of the source
distribution for diﬀerent depths and the distribution of photomet-
ric redshifts. For the realisation of a stage III survey considered
here, the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio ﬂattens oﬀ considerably
already at (cid:96) ≈ 600, whereas it is still rising at (cid:96) = 1000 for the
Euclid-like survey. This suggests that an appropriate treatment of
higher modes, taking diﬃculties such as non-linearities and intrin-
sic alignments into account, could lead to a signiﬁcant gain in infor-
mation. The inﬂuence of the iSW information on the total signiﬁ-
cance is below the per cent level; as we demonstrate below, cosmo-
logical constraints are nevertheless tightened because derivatives
with respect to cosmological parameters are changed and degen-
eracies broken.

4 ERROR FORECASTS
4.1 The Fisher matrix approach

The Fisher matrix formalism (Vogeley & Szalay 1996; Tegmark
et al. 1997) provides error forecasts for parameter estimation prob-
lems. Assuming a Gaussian distribution for the data and a Gaussian
posterior for the parameters, the Fisher matrix contains lower lim-
its on the variances and covariances of the parameters for a given
experimental design or for a model to be examined. The Fisher for-
malism assumes a Gaussian likelihood L centered on the reference
model and estimates expected statistical errors on parameters and
their correlations through the second derivatives of the logarithmic
likelihood,
Fαβ = −
(24)
(cid:112)
at the maximum of L. A lower bound for the marginal error on
the parameter θα is then given by the Cramér-Rao relation ∆θα ≥
F−1
αα.

Figure 6. Contributions of diﬀerent angular scales to the w0w0-element of
the Fisher matrix for stage III and stage IV weak lensing experiments. The
curves show the matrix element as a function of the multipole order (cid:96); the
Fisher matrix for the complete information is the sum of these terms over
all modes. The solid line is calculated from lensing data only, the dashed
line includes iSW measurements.

Errors obtained for a Euclid-like survey are smaller by about a
factor of four (cf. the remarks on the signal-to-noise ratio, Sec. 3);
the ﬁgure-of-merit increases by a factor of 34. The improvement
achieved with iSW information is smaller than for the DES-like sur-
vey – in absence of correlations constraints on Ωm, σ8, w0 and wa
improve by less than one per cent, whereas errors decrease by
about ten per cent if the full covariance is considered; the gain in
the ﬁgure-of-merit is 17 per cent. Figure 6 suggests that the ad-
ditional power in the low (cid:96) modes is overwhelmed somewhat by
the cosmological sensitivity of the high lensing multipoles, which
dominate the Fisher information. Note that the sensitivity peaks
at smaller scales compared to the stage III survey. It is still high
at (cid:96)max = 1000, suggesting that a Euclid-like survey can probe even
smaller scales; however, an appropriate treatment of non-linear
structure formation is indispensable in this case (cf. Sec. 5).

Table 2 lists errors obtained in combination with a CMB prior.
Even a stage III weak lensing survey is capable of narrowing con-
straints by 10–30 per cent compared to the CMB alone; for the
stage IV scenario improvements rise to up to 60 per cent. The cor-
relations between cosmic shear and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe ef-
fect only aﬀect the errors on w0 and wa below the per cent level.
The ﬁgure-of-merit increases by 40 per cent for the DES-like sur-
vey when information from weak lensing and the iSW eﬀect is
combined with the prior. For the Euclid-like scenario, the gain of
a factor of six in the ﬁgure-of-merit is remarkable and illustrates
the complementarity of CMB and cosmic shear surveys: while
marginal errors derived from either of the two data sets alone are of
the same order, the diﬀerent degeneracies between parameters help
improve the constraints. Including iSW information, however, does
not lead to appreciable further improvements.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have studied the cross-correlation between weak lensing and
the integrated Sachs-Wolfe eﬀect. The iSW eﬀect arises from the
evolution of the large-scale structure at late epochs, when the con-

and the iSW eﬀect, with (‘×’) and without (‘+’) information from cross-
correlations, in comparison with a stage IV survey (small ellipses).

Figure 5. As Fig. 4, but for the parameter combination (w0, wa).

iSW data are ignored, errors reduce by ﬁve to ten per cent com-
pared to cosmic shear alone; the ﬁgure-of-merit increases by 20
per cent. This demonstrates that valuable information is encoded in
the cross-correlation of the signals, in agreement with our interpre-
tation of the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient above (see Sec. 3). In
Figs. 4 and 5 the eﬀect of the additional information on the Fisher
ellipses is illustrated, demonstrating the decrease in size and the
altered degeneracy.

In Fig. 6 the contribution of individual angular modes to the
full Fisher information is illustrated: we plot the value of the sum-
mand in the formula (25) for the Fisher matrix, in this example
the w0w0-element, as a function of the multipole order (cid:96), which is
identical to the Fisher matrix if only a single angular mode is con-
sidered. The iSW signal clearly adds power on the largest scales.
With growing multipole order the Fisher information in the com-
bined experiment approaches the cosmic shear information; as ex-
pected, at (cid:96) = 40, the maximum multipole order in the iSW calcu-
lation, the gain is almost negligible.

tribution of dark energy (or the cosmological constant) to the den-
sity becomes appreciable. This evolution is also probed by cosmic
shear, weak lensing of galaxies by the large-scale structure.

In order to exploit the potential of cosmic shear to constrain
the growth of structures and spacetime geometry, an analysis of the
redshift-dependence of the signal is crucial. Current and upcom-
ing surveys can supply adequate photometric measurements for this
purpose. The heightened cosmological sensitivity is the key advan-
tage of a fully three-dimensional formalism over tomographic stud-
ies. The numerical complexity, however, increases considerably. In
three dimensions, the shear signal can be expanded in a basis of
spin-weighted spherical harmonics and spherical Bessel functions.
The three-dimensional observable is not statistically homogeneous
due to the radial weighting resulting from the distance-dependence
of the lensing eﬃciency, the source-redshift distribution and the
dispersion of the photometric redshifts. The loss of statistical ho-
mogeneity leads to mode coupling, i.e. ﬁnite covariances between
radial modes of diﬀerent wave number.

A challenge for cosmic shear studies is the description of the
matter distribution on small scales. In the linear regime, the sta-
tistical properties of the density ﬁeld are preserved, so that cor-
relations between modes can be traced back to the linear matter
power spectrum by the appropriate scaling with the growth func-
tion. Non-linear growth cannot be represented by such a scaling,
since modes no longer evolve independently. Insuﬃcient knowl-
edge of the statistical structure of the matter distribution can bias
results for the shear spectrum and cosmological parameters. Jain
& Seljak (1997), for example, found that second-order statistics of
the shear ﬁeld were strongly aﬀected by non-linearities on angular
scales below 10(cid:48), corresponding to multipole orders of (cid:96) (cid:38) 2000.
Deviations from a Gaussian likelihood were studied by Takada
& Jain (2009) and Sato & Nishimichi (2013). Jing et al. (2006)
showed that the eﬀects of baryons on structure formation, such as
radiative cooling and star formation, increased the power spectrum
of (two-dimensional) cosmic shear by up to 10 per cent for multi-
poles (cid:96) > 1000. van Daalen et al. (2011) similarly found that bary-
onic feedback lowered the matter power spectrum by a few percent
in the range 0.3 h Mpc−1 (cid:46) k (cid:46) 1 h Mpc−1, and Semboloni et al.
(2011) interpreted these results with respect to weak lensing to-
mography, cautioning that parameter biases might be as large as 40
per cent.

Intrinsic alignments are an additional uncertainty which be-
comes increasingly important on small scales (for recent reviews,
see Troxel & Ishak 2015; Kiessling et al. 2015; Kirk et al. 2015;
Joachimi et al. 2015). The formalism of cosmic shear is usually
built on the assumption that correlations between image elliptic-

ities are exclusively caused by gravitational lensing. Contrary to
this hypothesis, ﬁnite correlations between the orientations of close
pairs of galaxies, known as II-alignments, and anti-correlations
with the gravitational shear, so-called GI-alignments, have been
identiﬁed in numerical simulations (Heavens et al. 2000; Heymans
et al. 2006; Kuhlen et al. 2007) as well as in observations (Brown
et al. 2002; Heymans et al. 2004; Hirata et al. 2007; Okumura et al.
2009). Both types of alignments are attributed to the inﬂuence of
the local tidal ﬁeld on galaxy formation and can mimic a shear sig-
nal. The relevance for weak lensing cosmography has been noted
e.g. by Joachimi & Bridle (2010) and Kirk et al. (2010). Kirk et al.
(2012) found the bias in the equation of state parameter w0 to be
as large as 8–20 σ, but estimates vary depending on the modelling
of the spurious contribution to the shear spectrum (cf. Bridle &
King 2007; Capranico et al. 2013), implying that the impact on cos-
mological constraints is still far from clear. For three-dimensional
cosmic shear, Merkel & Schäfer (2013b) presented auto- and cross-
covariances of intrinsic and lensing-induced ellipticities. While II-
alignments were shown to be the major contaminant for a Euclid-
like survey with a median redshift of zm = 0.9, the lensing sig-
nal was still an order of magnitude higher at the multipole order
(cid:96) = 200. It is important to emphasise that in contrast to the com-
mon argument on statistically uncorrelated noise sources in cross-
correlations this would not apply to the iSW eﬀect and intrinsic
alignments: As both are sensitive to gravitational potentials and
their second derivative, respectively, there is in fact a nonvanish-
ing cross-correlation, which, however, is expected to be small.

We have circumnavigated these obstacles by restricting the
analysis to multipoles below (cid:96) = 1000 and radial modes up to
k = 1 h Mpc−1. These cuts do not fully but largely exclude the non-
linear regime. A more rigorous choice would be k (cid:39) 0.1 h Mpc−1.
We do not account for the small deviations that result from apply-
ing the linear growth function also in the weakly non-linear regime.
Because of the cuts in harmonic space information from the small-
est scales which can be probed by a Euclid-like survey becomes
inaccessible, but its evaluation would otherwise be subject to sub-
stantial uncertainties.

In order to quantitatively explore the impact of the additional
information encoded in the iSW signal and its cross-correlation
with the three-dimensional cosmic shear ﬁeld on cosmological pa-
rameter errors, we have carried out a Fisher analysis, consider-
ing DES-like (research stage III) and Euclid-like (stage IV) weak
lensing surveys. Only the latter can achieve marginal errors of the
same order as a CMB experiment, at least on Ωm, σ8, w0 and wa.
In light of the aforementioned uncertainties associated with non-
linear growth and intrinsic alignments, including a measurable sec-

MNRAS 000, 1–10 (2016)

ond order phenomenon in the form of the iSW eﬀect appears more
promising than extending the analysis to smaller scales in order to
improve constraints. The cosmological sensitivity is clearly raised
at the lowest multipole orders. We have demonstrated that the
cross-correlation indeed adds valuable information and helps break
degeneracies associated with a pure lensing experiment. Marginal
errors improve by up to 50 per cent for stage III speciﬁcations,
but they remain large, about a factor of four higher than for the
Euclid-like survey. For the latter, the inclusion of iSW data tight-
ens constraints on Ωm, σ8, w0 and wa by about ten per cent and
increases the dark energy ﬁgure-of-merit by 17 per cent; the gain
is negligible if correlations are ignored. Much stronger constraints
can be obtained for both scenarios in combination with other data
sets, particularly if a CMB prior is added, largely due to the com-
plementarity of CMB and cosmic shear surveys. Given such a prior
and 3d weak lensing data, we have shown that the iSW eﬀect in fact
does little to lower the errors further. Moreover, CMB data open
up the possibility of extending the covariance matrix by the cross-
correlation between cosmic shear and CMB lensing, enhancing the
cosmological sensitivity even further (Kitching et al. 2015).
