Thisthesisisconcernedwithdynamicsofconservativenonlinearwavesonboundeddo-
mains. In general, there are two scenarios of evolution. Either the solution behaves in
anoscillatory,quasiperiodicmannerorthenonlineareÔ¨Äectscausetheenergytoconcen-
trateonsmallerscalesleadingtoaturbulentbehaviour. Whichofthesetwopossibilities
occurs depends on a model and the initial conditions.
In the quasiperiodic scenario there exist very special time-periodic solutions. They
result for a delicate balance between dispersion and nonlinear interaction. The main
body of this dissertation is concerned with construction of time-periodic solutions for
various nonlinear wave equations on bounded domains.
While turbulence is mainly associated with hydrodynamics, recent research in Gen-
eral Relativity has also revealed turbulent phenomena. Numerical studies of a self-
gravitating massless scalar Ô¨Åeld in spherical symmetry gave evidence that anti-de Sitter
(AdS) space is unstable against black hole formation. It was demonstrated that there ex-
ists a large class of small perturbations of AdS which grow in time and eventually lead
to collapse‚Äîit is in stark contrast to the behaviour of small perturbations of Minkowski
space which disperse to inÔ¨Ånity. This mechanism attributed to resonant energy transfer
which is seen in weakly nonlinear perturbative calculations.
On the other hand there appeared many examples of asymptotically AdS solutions
which evade turbulent behaviour and appear almost periodic for long times. We discuss
here these two contrasting scenarios putting special attention to the construction (by
means of perturbative and numerical methods) and properties of strictly time-periodic
solutions. We analyze diÔ¨Äerent models where solutions of this type exist. We describe
similarities and diÔ¨Äerences among these models concerning properties of time-periodic
solutions and methods used for their construction.
Although studies in this thesis are directly connected to the problem of stability of
AdS space, of course we did not expect to answer to this diÔ¨Écult question. We give
details of numerical algorithms and explain steps of perturbative calculations pointing
out strengths and weaknesses of chosen approaches. We hope this text will serve as a
reference for further studies in this rapidly growing area of research.
Thistextisorganizedasfollows. InPartI,composedofthreechapters, weintroduce
the subject of our studies. In Chapter 1 we give a motivation and introduce some basic
concepts. Next, inChapter2, wegiveanabstractdescriptionoftechniques(bothpertur-
bative and numerical) used to construct time-periodic solutions. Variants of described
methods are used to study concrete systems in the following chapters. In Chapter 3
we introduce the models that we aim to study. We motivate their consideration, derive
equations of motion and formulate initial or initial-boundary value problems. We also
analyze the spectra of linear operators arising in the study of linear stability.
These models are studied in detail in Part II, which is composed of two chapters.
In Chapter 4 we study turbulent phenomena in nonlinear evolution systems and the

(in)stability problem for generic perturbations. We focus on the question of how the
dispersive and nondispersive spectrum of linear perturbations aÔ¨Äects the nonlinear dy-
namics. We investigate this issue by studying self-gravitating massless scalar Ô¨Åeld in a
perfectly reÔ¨Çecting cavity (Section 4.1) and the Yang-Mills (YM) Ô¨Åeld propagating on
the Einstein Universe (Section 4.2). In these models we have a freedom of changing the
character of the eigenfrequencies by imposing diÔ¨Äerent boundary conditions (the scalar
Ô¨Åeld case) or by considering perturbations in diÔ¨Äerent topological sectors (the YM Ô¨Åeld
model). In addition, we give the details of numerical methods used to solve the evolu-
tion equations. For the YM model we present the results of perturbative methods used
to describe a single linear mode initial data, which also serve as a starting point in the
construction of time-periodic solutions. We point out that the nondispersive spectrum
does not forbid the resonances to occur.
In Chapter 5 we study in detail time-periodic solutions for the systems of equa-
tions derived in Chapter 3.
In Section 5.1 we discuss the methods of constructing
time-periodic solutions for the real self-gravitating massless scalar Ô¨Åeld in spherical
symmetry (in any number of spatial dimensions). We point out the diÔ¨Äerences between
even and odd spatial dimensions and propose alternative methods for both cases. These
techniques are then adapted (in Section 5.2) to the construction of standing waves for
the complex scalar Ô¨Åeld. For both real and complex Ô¨Åeld cases we Ô¨Ånd both stable and
unstable solutions.
In analogy to the scalar Ô¨Åeld case we analyze the Bianchi IX cohomogenity-two
biaxial ansatz which allows for pure gravitational dynamical degrees of freedom in the
1 + 1 setting, and possesses time-periodic solutions (Section 5.3). The construction of
these solutions is much more demanding and their stability analysis is not conclusive.
InSections5.4and5.5wecontinuethestudiesinitiatedinChapter4onthespherical
cavity and the YM models, respectively. We construct time-periodic solutions in both
cases for dispersive and nondispersive linear spectrum and discuss how the character of
the spectrum aÔ¨Äects the structure of solutions and also the methods to construct them.
We conclude and discuss some directions for future work in Chapter 6.
In appendices we give additional details of numerical and analytical techniques. In
Appendix A we state the most important properties of orthogonal polynomials and give
a list of useful identities used in this thesis. Appendix B contains a detailed description
of pseudospectral spatial discretization based on Chebyshev polynomials, in particu-
lar their adaptation to spherically symmetric problems. Additionally in Appendix C
we present the Runge-Kutta time integration methods and state their most important
properties. These include symplectic methods mainly used in this work. Finally, in Ap-
pendix D we explain the method we use to calculate integrals appearing in perturbative
calculations which are crucial for eÔ¨Écient symbolic manipulation.

Introduction

Inthischapterweintroducethesubjectofourstudies. Aftergivingthemotivation(Sec-
tion 1.1), we review the anti-de Sitter space (Section 1.2). In Section 1.3 we shortly re-
view mathematical studies of time-periodic solutions and weak-turbulence phenomena.

1.1 Motivation‚Äî(in)stability of AdS space
Asymptotically anti-de Sitter (aAdS) spacetimes have come to play a central role in the-
oretical physics, prominently due to the AdS/CFT correspondence which conjectures a
duality between gravity in the AdS bulk and a quantum conformal Ô¨Åeld theory with a
large number of strongly interacting degrees of freedom living in the spacetime corre-
sponding to the AdS conformal boundary [110, 159]. Despite on important role of AdS
space plays in these theories, the question of its stability remains unanswered till now,
see [23] for a review. In contrast, the questions of stability of Minkowski and de Sitter
spacetimes have been answered in aÔ¨Érmative in [47] and [68] respectively.
Recent numerical and analytical studies of spherically symmetric self-gravitating
massless scalar Ô¨Åeld system with negative cosmological constant indicated that AdS
space may be unstable against the formation of a black hole under arbitrarily small per-
turbations [28, 98, 36] (under reÔ¨Çecting boundary conditions). Although gravitational
collapse seems to be a generic fate of small perturbations of AdS, it was suggested in
[28] that there may also exist a set of initial data for which the evolutions remains glob-
ally regular in time. This conjecture was substantiated in [112], where the evidence for
the existence of globally regular, nonlinearly stable, time-periodic solutions within the
same model was given. A similar class of aAdS solutions was studied in [37]. A similar
behaviourisexpectedforthepurevacuumcasewithsimplifyingsymmetryassumptions
(cohomogenity-two biaxial Bianchi IX ansatz) and with no symmetry assumptions [57,
58, 92]. These studies indicate that the structure of phase space for AdS gravity is com-
plex and poorly understood. Most recent analytical studies concentrate on the analysis
of wave equations on the Ô¨Åxed AdS [96] or the AdS-Schwarzschild backgrounds [144].
Therefore the numerical simulations will play a key role in further investigations of
these problems with major emphasis on assistance of analytic attempts.
The existence of (nontrivial) time-periodic solutions of ordinary and partial dif-
ferential equations is a fundamental problem. The existence proofs of time-periodic
solutions to simple semi-linear PDEs require advanced mathematical techniques (we
give some references in the following section). Thus Ô¨Ånding time-periodic solutions to

1.1. Motivation‚Äî(in)stability of AdS space

complicated elliptic-hyperbolic systems of PDEs is challenging and thus particularly
interesting on its own regardless of the stability problem of AdS. On the other hand it is
well known that, in asymptotically Ô¨Çat spacetimes, there are no nontrivial time-periodic
solutions to Einstein equations [19, 20]. This nonexistence proof points the diÔ¨Äerence
between the bounded and unbounded domains‚Äîthe mechanism that allows for a non-
trivial time-periodic solutions in aAdS cases is the lack of dissipation of energy. In
this thesis we give numerical and analytical studies of numerous systems of PDEs on
bounded domains which may guide and stimulate any further more rigorous eÔ¨Äorts.

Additionally, these studies where intended to develop numerical methods for eÔ¨É-
cientintegrationoftheEinsteinequationswithnegativecosmologicalconstantinspher-
ical symmetry. Applied space discretization methods are the core of our numerical
algorithm used to Ô¨Ånd time-periodic solutions, they are also used in the time evolu-
tion. We intend to develop methods which are robust and general, in particular we
apply two diÔ¨Äerent methods for the Einstein-massless scalar Ô¨Åeld system depending on
a parity of space dimension. Our studies demonstrate the eÔ¨Éciency of using spectral
methods in space discretization for the aAdS spaces. Initially developed for studies
of turbulence phenomena, spectral methods increased their wide applicability in nu-
merical solutions to the Einstein equations, see e.g. [124, 123] for an application of
the Galerkin approach in the studies of gravitational collapse of self-gravitating scalar
Ô¨Åeld with spherical symmetry assumption in asymptotically Ô¨Çat case. For review on
spectral methods in numerical relativity we refer to [78]. Besides spatial discretization
we also emphasize particular properties of symplectic integration methods [82]. Time
stepping methods are usually selected to achieve some prescribed accuracy at the least
cost, that is to minimize the product of the cost per time step and the number of time
steps needed. For general systems of ODEs the symplectic method is necessarily im-
plicit (which is more costly than the explicit one) but their long time near conservation
of the systems invariants and large stability domains (compared to explicit methods)
make them especially advantageous in the studies of Hamiltonian systems. In practice,
the ODE methods that we use are either explicit or implicit depending on a structure of
the system under study.
Moreover, eÔ¨Écient implementation of these techniques may be regarded as a good
exerciseforthosewillingtomastertheirprogrammingskillsin Mathematica[94].Writ-
ing codes for numerical solution of evolutionary PDEs in Mathematica when using
semi-discretemethodoflinesapproach(MOL),isreducedtoimplementationofthespa-
tial discretization due to modular structure of the NDSolve function [116] and plenty
of ODE integration algorithms already implemented [118, 117]. Functional and pat-
ternmatchingprogrammingfacilitiesof Mathematicawereparticularlyadvantageousin
concise and readable implementation of our perturbative construction of time-periodic
solutions.
While most of the numerical methods where implemented in Mathematica, some
were coded from scratch in FORTRAN. Besides Mathematica we also acknowledge
other plotting software, Pyxplot [64] and CustomTicks package [41], used to produce
Ô¨Ågures placed in this thesis. We further acknowledge GRQUICK package [142] used
to derive necessary Ô¨Åeld equations.

the user.

We compactify the AdS space by extending the range of the radial coordinate to  ‡¢†
[0, ‡¢ß2].

by, e.g. 0 =  cos , +1 =  sin  and  = 0,  = 1, ‚Ä¶ , . This feature is lost
if we unwrap the hyperboloid by considering the covering space of AdS (abbreviated
as CAdS). We denote the unwrapped timelike coordinate by  ‡¢† R. The CAdS+1 has
the topology R+1 and contains no closed timelike curves. Hereafter we consider only
CAdS+1, i.e. we identify the AdS+1 with its covering space.
The metrics given in (1.6) and (1.8) are indeed solutions to the vacuum Einstein
equations (1.1) with ' = ‚àí( ‚àí 1)‡¢ß(22). In coordinates (1.8) we see that the con-
formal boundary of AdS, corresponding to spatial and null inÔ¨Ånity, is the hypersurface
 = ‡¢ß2. It is the timelike cylinder√´ = R √ó ‚àí1 with the boundary metric

‚àí1.

d2√´ = ‚àí d2 + sin2 d2

(1.9)
Since the spatial and null inÔ¨Ånity is a timelike hypersurface the information may be lost
to or gained from this surface in Ô¨Ånite coordinate time . The consequence of this is that
there exists no complete Cauchy surface‚Äîthe AdS space is not globally hyperbolic.
This means that given initial data on a constant  hypersurface, it is not possible to
prescribe evolution in the region beyond the Cauchy development of this surface. This
isseenonFig.1.2showingthePenrosediagramofAdSinglobalcoordinates(1.8). The
unique determination of evolution is possible only if the data on √´ is also prescribed
[67, 86].
Important property of AdS space is its conformal structure. From (1.8) we see that
the AdS metric ƒÆ is conformally related to the Einstein Universe (its generalizations
to higher dimensions) metric via  = 2 ƒÆ, with conformal factor‚Ä†  = cos ‡¢ß, see
also Fig. 1.2.

space as its portion; with ( ‚àí 2) dimensions suppressed these represent concentric
cylinders with diameters  =  and  = ‡¢ß2 respectively.

The detailed analysis of both global and Poincar√© coordinates shows that the
Poincar√© AdS boundary contains both the points of the AdS boundary ( = ‡¢ß2) and
the points of the AdS bulk in global coordinates (see Fig. 1.2). For the details of map-
ping of Poincar√© AdS boundary to the global AdS we refer to [13]. In contrast to the
global coordinates both of the Poincar√© charts  < 0 and  > 0 do not cover the whole
AdS space. In fact, these coordinate patches cover only the shaded part of the Penrose
diagram depicted on Fig. 1.2. Though widely used in the AdS/CFT (because of the
Ô¨Çatness of the boundary metric), the Poincar√© coordinates are not suitable for studies
of global properties of the AdS space. Therefore we use the global coordinates and
consider AdS+1 with metric given in Eq. (1.8).
It is also useful to derive geometric quantities of AdS as these serve as singularity
formation indicators in the dynamical aAdS spaces. The AdS+1, as being maximally
symmetric space, has a constant scalar curvature

Studies on the NLS are also motivated by its importance in modeling various physical
systems: the Bose-Einstein condensates, nonlinear optics or plasma physics. These
problems are usually posed on a -dimensional cube  ‡¢† √¶ = (0, ),  ‡¢† R and
typically with Dirichlet boundary conditions (, )‡¢†√¶ = 0. Techniques developed
forthesetoymodels(especiallyfor  = 1)arefurtherappliedtomorecomplexsystems.
OverdecadesmathematiciansconsideredvariousmodiÔ¨Åcationsof(1.15)and(1.16)
including other boundary conditions (like periodic boundary conditions then the do-
main is ), generalization of the nonlinear term, and also the extension to higher
dimensions; also same results are often derived or reÔ¨Åned using diÔ¨Äerent techniques.
We give here only few results of vast mathematical literature on the existence of time-
periodic and quasi-periodic solutions to the nonlinear wave and Schr√∂dinger equations.
First studies of the one-dimensional problem (1.15) reach back to the seminal work
[128] where using variational method it was shown that (under some restrictions on )
there exists (not necessarily small) time-periodic solutions. Moreover, these form very
special class of solutions with period being rational multiple of . Further proofs of the
existence of time-periodic solutions of NLW based on a Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser
(KAM) type techniques were developed independently in [30] and in [145]. First of
all, these give solutions when  ﬂ∞(0) ‡£î 0 (a problem with the mass term‚Äîthe nonres-
onant case) and complement the result of [128] in a sense that here solutions period is
non-rational multiple of . Using other techniques (method based on the Nash-Moser
generalized implicit function theorem and on the Lyapunov-Schmidt decomposition)
these results were extended to include generic class of nonlinearities [55]. A very spe-
cial result, the proof of existence of small amplitude time-periodic solutions to the one-
dimensional NLW with cubic defocusing term, i.e. for () = ‚àí3, was given in [108].
Generalizations of former proofs to higher dimensional problems were given in [31]
(for massive case on ).

Here by bounded (compact) domain we mean Ô¨Ånite interval or Ô¨Ånite cube with appropriate boundary

conditions imposed, e.g. with periodic boundary conditions for problems on a -dimensional torus .

12

1.3. Waves on bounded domains‚Äîtime-periodic solutions and weak turbulence

Not always theorems guarantee existence of continuous family of time-periodic so-
lutions (the case studied in this thesis), rather the existence of Cantor-like sets (of mea-
surezero)ofsuchsolutionswereproved, seee.g. [55];whiletheseresultsareconstantly
reÔ¨Ånedtoincludemoresolutions[75].Formorerecentresults,includinggeneralizations
to higher dimensions and other types of evolution equations see [18, 76] and references
therein.
The complicated proofs of existence of time-periodic solutions give little infor-
mation about their form and properties (including their stability). An exception is
[143, 101] where the analytical construction of time-periodic solutions (based on the
Poincar√©-Lindstedtperturbativeapproach)forthemasslessone-dimensionalNLWwith
cubic nonlinearity and periodic boundary conditions is explicitly demonstrated. The
authors of [143, 101] construct solutions bifurcating from a fundamental frequency of
linear mode and in particular they resolve the leading-order expansion term which is a
nontrivial inÔ¨Ånite superposition of linear modes rather than just a single mode (feature
present in one of the models considered below).
Very little is known about the behaviour of generic initial conditions. The results on
the existence of small amplitude solutions (starting from Ô¨Ånite number of linear modes)
which stay almost periodic for exponentially long times are given in [10, 11]. Such
behaviour was conÔ¨Årmed recently in the numerical studies of a one-dimensional NLW
withpositivemassterm(thenonresonantcase)andquadraticnonlinearitywithperiodic
boundary conditions, see [51, 74]. Authors consider small amplitude initial data con-
centrated in one Fourier mode whose evolution demonstrates that the energy remains
essentially localized in the initial Fourier mode over time scales that are much longer
than predicted by standard perturbation theory. These results are then accompanied
with proofs relaying on a modulated Fourier expansions in time [82].
The theorem stating the existence of solutions with growing in time higher Sobolev
norms‚Ä† for the NLS on 2 with cubic defocusing nonlinearity was proved in [52]. The-
ses particular solutions exhibit energy transfer from low to high modes which in turn
induce a growth in time of higher Sobolev norms (the conservation of energy associ-
ated with (1.16) implies that 1 norm of solution stays bounded). This statement was
further reÔ¨Åned in [80] where the existence of solutions with polynomial time estimates
was proved.
Numerical studies in [53] of a toy model (the one proposed in [52] to approximate
dynamics of the original problem) have shown that indeed a simpliÔ¨Åed Ô¨Ånite dimen-
sional dynamical system approximates the original problem, and more importantly that
the energy cascade is a generic phenomenon (a conclusion supported by statistical stud-
ies).
Studies of the energy cascade of cubic NLS on multidimensional torus where re-
ported in [42] where authors study a special small amplitude  initial conditions and
give precise description of growth of higher modes. This construction is valid only up
to time of order 1‡¢ß and does not depend on the focusing or defocusing character of
nonlinearity. Authors provide numerical illustration of that phenomena and observe
stabilization in higher Sobolev norms (despite the fact they consider resonant case);
after a suÔ¨Éciently long time all modes are present but the energy Ô¨Çow is less active
(defocusing case).
In contrast to the instability results (the one showing that starting with initial data
‚Ä†Sobolev normﬂ† ﬂ†, is a natural norm of the Sobolev space  ,‚Äîspace of functions such that their
weak derivatives of order up to  have Ô¨Ånite  norm. In one dimensional case such norm is deÔ¨Åned as:

with small  norms these grow arbitrarily in time) there are results showing the long-
time (orbital) stability of plane waves (a single mode initial conditions), see e.g. [61,
155].
All these studies concern relatively simple cases namely the equations (1.15) and
(1.16) have a very simple linear modes (especially for problems posed on  these
are exponents) for which any product (the nonlinearity) can be expressed as Ô¨Ånite sums
easily. Thisstaysincontrasttotheequationsconsideredinthisthesis, wheretheexplicit
form of eigenfunctions is complicated so this makes the analysis particularly involved.
Moreover, in most of the considered cases we deal with coupled elliptic-hyperbolic
systems which makes the problem still more challenging.

Constructing time-periodic
solutions

In this chapter we review methods we use to Ô¨Ånd time-periodic solutions for studied
PDEs in more abstract setting. A more exhaustive discussion, regarding necessary
modiÔ¨Åcations and details of the construction, is postponed until concrete models are
analyzed. After introducing the problem (Section 2.1) we describe in Section 2.2 both
of used methods: the analytical approach, which is based on Poincar√©-Lindstedt per-
turbative expansion, and the numerical root-Ô¨Ånding approach with pseudospectral dis-
cretization. We also comment on other applicable techniques, in particular we brieÔ¨Çy
review the minimization approach (Section 2.3). This chapter is also intended to set
necessary notation and conventions used throughout this thesis.

2.1 Formulation of the problem
Let us consider an initial-boundary value problem

 =  (),

(2.1)
(, ) ‡¢† [0, √ù)√ó[, ], with ‚àí√ù <  <  < √ù where  is a smooth function of  and its
spatial derivatives only, in particular it is assumed to be explicitly independent of time
so that (2.1) is an autonomous NLW. For simplicity we take the homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary conditions (, ) = (, ) = 0 (other combination of non-dissipative condi-
tionsarepermitted). WhenEq.(2.1)isconsideredasaninitialboundaryvalueproblem,
theinitialconditions (0, )and (0, )areassumedtobesmooth, inparticulartoavoid
corner singularities they have to fulÔ¨Åll boundary conditions accompanied to (2.1).

We are looking for nontrivial solutions to Eq. (2.1) satisfying

‡¢ò ‡¢† R,

( +  , ) = (, ),

(2.2)
with some Ô¨Ånite period  > 0. First, we consider the linear perturbation of the static
solutions to this equation. For any static solution (, ) = () satisfying
(2.3)
We restrict this consideration to the simplest case of a second order in time one dimensional wave
equation which appears in all of the considered problems here. Generalization to other types of equations,
e.g. to NLS, or to higher dimensions is straightforward.

and neglect higher order terms, we obtain the linear, homogeneous wave equation for
the perturbation , namely
(2.6)
where by  = ‚àí ﬂ∞() we denote the linear diÔ¨Äerential operator. We use the stan-
dard approach to solve Eq. (2.6) and separate variables, by taking the ansatz (, ) =
‚àí ƒØ(), which transforms Eq. (2.6) to the eigenvalue problem for ƒØ. Then, the solu-

which is parametrized by real constants: the amplitudes ƒÆ and the phases , which
are uniquely determined by the initial conditions (0, ) and (0, ).
The spectrum of an operator  gives the eigenfrequencies‚Ä† which are nondisper-
sive when d‡¢ß d = const, and dispersive in the opposite. These are also referred as
being resonant (as these producing resonances) and nonresonant (the case when no res-
onances are expected) respectively. There is also a term completely resonant (or fully
resonant) which refers to the cases when all the eigenfrequencies are rational multiples
of one another (this the most common for the considered case). We will show that this
distinction (between resonant and noresonant spectrum) is sometimes misleading since
resonancesareequallycommonalsoinnondispersivecases. Wearguethatthepresence
of resonances or their lack should be attributed to the structure of equations rather than
to the character of the linear spectrum.

2.2 Techniques
2.2.1 Perturbative approach
The analysis of the linearized equation (2.6) and the eigenvalue problem (2.7) is the
Ô¨Årst step toward the construction of time-periodic solutions to the nonlinear equation
(2.1). Clearly, for unstable static solutions no time-periodic perturbations are expected
to exist, though time-periodic solutions may be unstable on their own.

‚Ä†We commonly use the term ‚Äôspectrum of ‚Äô when referring to the square roots of its eigenvalues‚Äîthe

eigenfrequencies of .

The linear equation (2.6) has (inÔ¨Ånitely) many nontrivial time-periodic solutions.

In particular, the very special time-periodic solution is just a single eigenmode

(2.9)
for any  ‡¢† N0. One can add more eigenmodes to (2.9) in such a way that the solu-
tion still be periodic with fundamental period  = 2‡¢ß or one can modify formula
(2.9) so that it will no longer be periodic with that period. In particular, for any Ô¨Åxed
frequency  ( ‡¢† N0) the solutions to Eq. (2.6) in the following form

where
(2.11)
is the set of resonant indices associated with , are periodic with period  for any ƒÆ ‡¢†
R,  ‡¢† . If (, ) contains other eigenfrequencies absent in  then it is no longer
periodic with period . There is a distinction between Ô¨Ånite number of such additional
frequencies present in , we have then a quasi-periodic solution, while solutions with
inÔ¨Ånite number of additional frequencies present we call an almost-periodic.
The observation that the linear equation possesses time-periodic solutions (in fact
manyofthem)isthestartingpointofourconstructionoftime-periodicsolutionsaround
the equilibrium  to the corresponding nonlinear equation. It is natural to expect that a
small amplitude solutions to the nonlinear problem smoothly converge to the solutions
of the linear equation. Therefore for each eigenfrequency  ( ‡¢† N0) there should be
a bifurcation branch of a family of time-periodic solutions for the nonlinear system. Of
course with this approach one can construct the bifurcating solutions only; the question
about the existence of other types of solutions like the non-bifurcating time-periodic
solutions found in [128] stays open.
The perturbative procedure proposed in this thesis relies on the Poincar√©-Lindstedt
method [15, 100] in which both the solution proÔ¨Åle function and its oscillation fre-
quency are expanded in powers of a small parameter  which measures the size of the
solution (or equivalently the magnitude of nonlinearity). Since the equation (2.1) is au-
tonomous the oscillation frequency of time-periodic solution is a priori unknown. For
convenience we change variables
(2.12)
and rewrite Eq. (2.1) for  =  ‚àí  as

 =  ,

(2.13)
where  is the nonlinear part of  such that (0) = 0. Then, we deÔ¨Åne perturbative
series expansion in  for both the solution  and the frequency 

(2.18)
with the source term depending on all lower order terms, here 2 ‡£ï 2(1, 1). For
generic choice of free parameters in (2.17) there will be no chance to obtain bounded
solution to (2.18). This is because the source term, in general, would contain resonant
terms, i.e.
terms like cos() () with  = ‡¢ß,  ‡¢† N0,  ‡¢† N; these will
be present even for dispersive (nonresonant) spectrum of linear perturbations.‚Ä† When
not removed, they produce secular terms in 2, terms proportional to , which would
spoil the periodicity and result in unbounded solution. Therefore, we use a freedom
we have in setting the parameters 1 and ƒÆ1, in (2.17) to remove all of the resonant
terms present in 2. It may happen (and is common in considered cases) that only one
resonance appears at the lowest nontrivial order, here at  = 2, which is then removed
by the frequency shift 1, so instead of (2.17) it suÔ¨Éces to take a single mode in 1, i.e.
(2.19)
(the amplitude ƒÆ1, will be Ô¨Åxed by the normalization condition which will deÔ¨Åne ex-
pansion parameter ). When more (typically inÔ¨Ånite number) resonances are present at
second order then using (2.17) is necessary and the amplitudes ƒÆ1, are used to produce
a uniformly bounded solution to (2.18). This then takes the general form

of boundary expansion of eigenbasis with that of smooth solutions to the nonlinear
equation (2.13). Higher order terms are derived in similar way using the integration
constants and frequency expansion coeÔ¨Écient we have from the previous order.
This method is a variant of the Poincar√©-Lindsted perturbative approach, since we
also relax the initial conditions to remove all of the resonant terms appearing at succes-
sive perturbative orders . This may be also regarded as a shooting method since our
aim is to Ô¨Ånd periodic and bounded solution by suitably tuning the initial values such
that no secular terms appear and (2, ) = (0, ).
Whenonlysingleeigenmodeispresentin(2.17)andhigherordertermsin(2.14)can
be written as a Ô¨Ånite linear combination of eigenfunctions we can reduce the problem of
solving PDEs to a much simpler task of integrating ODEs. Then, taking the advantages
of CAS in manipulating lengthy expressions, the perturbative calculation can be carried
up to very high order. Additionally, if the structure of the problem allows for some sort
ofalgorithmization,thenthewholeprocedureofconstructingoftime-periodicsolutions
can be eÔ¨Éciently implemented yielding ‚Äôa black box‚Äô procedure (for example this is the
case for the EKG system in even spatial dimensions).
Analysis of concrete examples shows that the above method requires some modi-
Ô¨Åcations. Details of perturbative construction of time-periodic solutions will be given
on the case by case manner, however the idea behind many technical issues remain the
same,withsomeminormodiÔ¨Åcationscomingfromspecialformsofanalyzedequations.
In particular, for the Einstein equations, in addition to the wave equation for the dynam-
ical degrees of freedom, one needs to solve also the constraints, which are relatively
easy to work out. Also, special form of governing equations may force some speciÔ¨Åc
form of perturbative expansions, for example, with only odd coeÔ¨Écients present. These
and other details are addressed in the subsequent chapters.

 = ( + 1)( + 1). Next, we approximate a smooth function

(, ) by considering its Ô¨Ånite expansion in terms of ( + 1) eigenbasis functions and
( + 1) trigonometric polynomials

where √´, is the orthogonal projection from 2[0, 2) √ó [, ] onto , (to sim-
plify the notation in the following chapters we omit the explicit projection operator and
simply identify approximated function with its interpolant remembering that we always
consider its Ô¨Ånite-dimensional approximation). If the expansion coeÔ¨Écients ƒÆ, decay
exponentially fast with growing mode index,¬ß then the truncated sum (2.24) should
serve as good approximation to the continuous solution. Using Ô¨Ånite dimensional rep-
resentation (2.24) it is easy to compute its time derivative

√´,(0,  ) = ,

To close the system we add the condition Ô¨Åxing the amplitude of the solution, e.g. by
setting
(2.29)
to some prescribed value  ‡¢† R (not necessarily small) which identiÔ¨Åes a particular
solution. The choice of  depends on a used parametrization of time-periodic solutions,
one of the possible choices is to control the amplitude of dominant mode (we comment
on the issue of taking proper parametrization throughout the subsequent parts of the
text). This gives another constraint on the expansion coeÔ¨Écients ƒÆ, and allows to
uniquely determine the approximate time-periodic solution to Eq. (2.13).
The resulting set of equations is solved with the Newton-Raphson algorithm using
an approximate Jacobian matrix of (2.27) and (2.29) computed numerically using Ô¨Årst
order forward FDA.ﬂ† It is not only the most strightforward approach, but for dense
systems that we encounter this is also the most eÔ¨Äective method, since even with an
analytic formula computing numerical value of the Jacobian would be very expensive.
The above method is a modiÔ¨Åed version of numerical method (without explicit
derivation of iterative scheme) introduced in [32] intended to derive spatially periodic
breathers of classical 4 Ô¨Åeld theory. Alternative approach was proposed in [63] to
study self-interacting scalar Ô¨Åeld on a Ô¨Åxed AdS background where the spatial dis-
cretization was realized by using Chebyshev polynomial approximation on divided ra-
dial domain.

2.3 Alternative methods
In this section we review the variational method for computation of time-periodic so-
lutions which was used by the author at the very initial stage of his studies. Most of the
methodsdevelopedtoÔ¨Ånd-timeperiodicsolutionsofPDEsaregeneralizationsofshoot-
ingmethodforODEs. Themethodof[4]isalsoanextensionofmulti-shootingmethod,
it was originally used for computation of time-periodic solution to the Benjamin-Ono
equation (a dispersive PDE modelling the evolution of waves on deep water, with peri-
odic boundary conditions); see also [3, 5] and references therein.
Such minimization procedure can be applied to a wide variety of PDEs, for simplic-
ity we illustrate it and consider (2.1), which we rewrite as a system of two Ô¨Årst order
equations using vector notation

(2.34)
and look for minimizers of ∆â hoping that such minimum exist and the minimum value
of  is zero. The  part in (2.33), called the penalty function, is arbitrary and can
be deÔ¨Åned to Ô¨Åx the phase of time-periodic solution or its size (the amplitude). The
inclusion of penalty functional is very important since it Ô¨Åxes the values of the free
parameters that describe the manifold of nontrivial time-periodic solutions (without
this part in  only trivial solutions are found, like constant or traveling waves).
The minimization is performed by the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)
algorithm [120], which requires not only the value of the functional ∆â at speciÔ¨Åed point
evaluated at each of its internal step. Computing
but also its gradients ∆â
0
can be very costly numerically, e.g. by straightforward use of Ô¨Ånite diÔ¨Äerencing.
∆â
The advantage of the method of [4] is that it allows to compute gradient of (2.34) with
0
respect to the initial data vector 0 in as little computational time as it takes to get value
of ∆â itself (typically variational derivatives of penalty functional  are easy to obtain
and are computationally inexpensive). We shortly review this approach below.
The derivative of  with respect to  is easy to obtain, indeed from Eq. (2.34) we
have

(2.43)
which can be obtained at the cost of solving Eq. (2.42), which is comparable to the cost
of solving Eq. (2.30) itself.
Unfortunately, this approach (at least in the form used by the author) has a se-
rious drawback, namely slow convergence. Solving both evolution equations (2.30)
and (2.42) using the MOL approach with spectral discretization in space together with
Runge-Kutta (RK) time-integration algorithm will lead to the overall polynomial con-
vergence. For very precise calculations and for very complex PDEs, like the Einstein
equations, this would be very ineÔ¨Écient. For this reason we prefer the method pre-
sented in the previous section. The spectral decomposition method, for the problems at
hand, gives the overall fast spectral convergence, and as a consequence more eÔ¨Écient
algorithm.

3.1. Einstein-Klein-Gordon system
In the asymptotically Ô¨Çat situation the above system (with  ‡£ï 0) has been ex-
tensively studied in the past leading to important insights about the dynamics of grav-
itational collapse. In particular, Christodoulou showed that for small initial data the
Ô¨Åelds disperse to inÔ¨Ånity [49], while for large initial data black holes are formed [48]. A
borderline between these two generic outcomes of evolution was explored numerically
by Choptuik leading to the discovery of critical phenomena at the threshold of black
hole formation [44]. Following studies explored other matter models which resulted in
deeper understanding of critical behaviour in gravitational collapse, see e.g. [81] and
references therein.

The numerical studies of critical phenomena in the presence of negative cosmo-
logical constant were initiated in [127] studying self-gravitating EKG system in (2+1)
dimensions under the assumption of axial symmetry. These studies concentrated on the
threshold phenomena and asymptotic behaviour after the black hole formation. Later
studies were concentrating on identiÔ¨Åcation and understanding of the critical solution
[70, 71]. For a long time the evolution of small amplitude perturbations of AdS within
the EKG system stayed unexplored (see [23] for a comment) until the works [28, 98],
which were later independently conÔ¨Årmed and further extended to the complex scalar
Ô¨Åeld case [36, 37]. These studies were accompanied with analytical considerations [57,
58]andmostrecently[90,89,91]includingtheproofsofstabilityoftheSchwarzschild-
AdS solution and the global well-posedness of the EKG system with ' < 0 (these stud-
ies were restricted to spherical symmetry). Finally, recent numerical studies [9] of the
system (3.4)-(3.6) support connection of AdS dynamics with the famous Fermi-Pasta-
Ulam (FPU) problem, see e.g. [16].

Regarding the complexity of the dynamics of Einstein equations with negative cos-
mological constant recent numerical studies are mainly restricted to spherical sym-
metry (therefore the scalar Ô¨Åeld models are considered‚Äîas being the simplest matter
models‚Äîin order to evade BirkhoÔ¨Ä theorem [59] and generate dynamics). A notable
exception is [12] which in 2 + 1 setting ((3) symmetry imposed in Ô¨Åve spacetime
dimensions) demonstrate prompt black hole formation from large amplitude scalar per-
turbations and its relaxation through quasinormal ringing.

Complex scalar Ô¨Åeld studies include both the construction and properties of station-
ary conÔ¨Ågurations (standing waves/boson stars) and their dynamics. DiÔ¨Äerent variants
oftheEKGsystem,withrelaxedsymmetryassumptionsaswellaswithnumerousforms
of self-interaction term, were studied in the past both with and without cosmological
constant. Among the results [36, 37] directly connected to the subject of this thesis the
boson shells) with V-shaped ( (2) = ) potential studied in [85] and solutions
most recent analysis of the EKG with ' < 0 include conÔ¨Ågurations (boson stars and
with helical symmetry [137, 138].

Here, to reduce the complexity of the EKG system, we impose spherical symmetry
and consider self-gravitating scalar Ô¨Åeld only by putting the potential term  to zero (so
in particular we exclude massive Ô¨Åelds). We regard the space dimension  appearing in
the EKG system as a discrete parameter so in particular we do not prefer any of  = 3,
 = 28 or  = 2014 cases.

which is even or odd depending on the space dimension  only (independently on the
eigenmode index  ‡¢† N0). This is in contrast to the series expansion (3.27) of the
scalar Ô¨Åeld (, ) for odd  and  ‡£î 0, where the scalar Ô¨Åeld has no deÔ¨Ånite sym-
metry. Therefore prescribing initial data such as a superposition of Ô¨Ånite number of
eigenmodes (in particular a single eigenmode) for odd  will lead to a corner singu-
larity (incompatibility of initial and boundary data) and consequently to non-smooth
evolution. This incompatibility has a direct consequence in the design of numerical
method for time-evolution and construction of time-periodic solutions (both perturba-
tivelly and numerically); this issue will be addressed and discussed in the subsequent
chapters of this work.

3.2 Cohomogenity-two biaxial Bianchi IX

ansatz

Due to the BirkhoÔ¨Ä theorem [59], Einstein‚Äôs equations in spherical symmetry have no
dynamical degrees of freedom. Thus, in order to generate dynamics in spherical sym-
metry one needs to include matter. In the previous section we have considered a very
simple matter model‚Äîa minimally coupled self-gravitating scalar Ô¨Åeld. One can evade
the BirkhoÔ¨Ä theorem at the expense of going to higher (odd spacetime) dimensions.
Such model which admits radially symmetric gravitational waves was introduced in
[25] (see also [29]). It was numerically studied in the context of critical behaviour in
vacuum gravitational collapse [25, 24]. Later, the nine-dimensional version was used
for the numerical studies of stability of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole [22].
Here we adapt cohomogenity-two biaxial Bianchi IX ansatz to the studies of aAdS
spaces. It appears that this provides the simplest 1 + 1 dimensional system with pure
gravitational degrees of freedom where the turbulent dynamics was also observed [27]
supporting the AdS instability conjecture [28]. However in this thesis we apply this
modeltostudypurelygravitationaltime-periodicsolutionstothevacuumEinsteinequa-
tions. These solutions which are held exclusively by the gravitational Ô¨Åeld, appear to
be nonlinearly stable (against perturbations within this ansatz) thus may be considered
as an realization of the Wheeler geon [154, 35],
Another motivation for these studies is the special role that AdS5 plays in AdS/CFT
correspondence,whichstatesthatTypeIIBstringtheoryontheproductspaceAdS5√ó5
is equivalent to  = 4 super Yang-Mills theory on the four-dimensional conformal
boundary [110, 159].

3.2.1 Equations of motion
Following [29] we take the metric ansatz for aAdS space in (4 + 1) dimensions (3.7)
and replace the round metric on 3 with the homogeneously squashed metric, thereby
breaking the (4) isometry to (3) √ó (1)

The ,  and  are functions of (, ) ‡¢† (‚àí√ù, √ù) √ó [0, ‡¢ß2) and  are left invariant

take the form
(3.36)
In this way the squashing parameter  becomes a dynamical degree of freedom and
the BirkhoÔ¨Ä theorem is evaded. Substituting the ansatz (3.35) into the vacuum Einstein
equations in (4 + 1) dimensions

This system has a very similar structure to the EKG system of Section 3.1.1, cf.

(3.38)-(3.42) does not have the reÔ¨Çection symmetry  ‡¢ê ‚àí which is present for the

(3.47a)
(3.47b)
(3.47c)
where the functions ƒ≤4(), ƒ≤0() and a constant  uniquely determine the power series

nofreedominimposingtheboundarydata. Thus,theCauchyproblemforsmoothinitial

Chapter 3. Models
3.3 Spherical cavity model
We consider small perturbations of a portion of (3+1) dimensional Minkowski space-
timeenclosedinsideatimelikeworldtube R√ó3. Admittedly, thisproblemissomewhat
artiÔ¨Åcial geometrically, yet we think that it sheds some new light on the results of [28,
98]. The aim of the work [111] was to see how these Ô¨Åndings are aÔ¨Äected by placing a
reÔ¨Çecting mirror at some Ô¨Ånite radius  = . In other words, instead of asymptotically
Ô¨Çat boundary conditions, we consider the interior problem inside a ball of radius  with
either Dirichlet (, ) = 0 or Neumann ﬂ∞(, ) = 0 boundary condition.
The idea of putting the scalar Ô¨Åeld in a box is not completely new. The similarity
of quantization of scalar Ô¨Åeld theory in AdS and in the box with reÔ¨Çecting boundary
conditions was pointed out in [7]. The Ô¨Årst attempt toward simulations of black holes (a
binary system) in AdS space was carried out in [158, 157] with a reÔ¨Çecting boundary
conditions imposed on a spherical box (though the cosmological constant was set to
zero). The simulations showed stability of the numerical scheme conÔ¨Årmed by the
convergence tests for times up to two reÔ¨Çections of gravitational signal produced in the
merger oÔ¨Ä the boundary.
Following the work [28] there appeared papers [72, 73] where the instability of AdS
was studied. Because the radial coordinate was not compactiÔ¨Åed the authors prescribed
thereÔ¨ÇectingboundaryconditionsatsomeÔ¨Åxedradialdistancefromtheorigintomimic
the reÔ¨Çective property of AdS space. Since they studied the system with both cosmo-
logical constant and perfectly reÔ¨Çecting mirror their results were not conclusive as far
as the role of the ' term is concerned. Despite the use of the nonuniform spatial grid
to track the steep gradients of the scalar Ô¨Åeld proÔ¨Åles, the results where not conclusive
for small perturbations‚ÄîÔ¨Ånally the sharp scalar peak travels over whole spatial domain
(see comments in [98]). A similar setup, restricting the radial domain of AdS (so also
with ' < 0) and putting the reÔ¨Çecting boundary conditions for the complex scalar Ô¨Åeld,
was studied [36, 37].
Here we set the cosmological constant to zero and study the self-gravitating EKG
system with reÔ¨Çecting boundary conditions imposed at the spherical cavity. We present
extended studies of this system, by supplementing [111, 114]. In particular we perform
more detailed analysis of the Neumann boundary problem since it substantially diÔ¨Äers
form the Dirichlet case as pointed out in [114] (see [121] with opposite conclusions).
Furthermore we construct and describe small amplitude time-periodic solutions in this
system, both for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, mainly to point out on
the diÔ¨Äerences among other systems we consider.
The well-posedness of this is system is not proved, however we demonstrate this
showing convergence tests (supporting the consistency and stability) of our numerical
methods. On a well-posedness proof of certain initial boundary value problems for the
vacuum Einstein equations see [69] and also [156].

3.3.1 Equations of motion
We restrict ourselves to spherical symmetry and to  = 3 and consider a minimally
coupled self-gravitating real massless scalar Ô¨Åeld (, ) as a matter source with stress-
energy tensor (3.5) (again we study the simplest case and set potential  ‡£ï 0). It is con-
venient to parametrize the general spherically symmetric metric of (3+1)-dimensional
spacetime in the following way

which is constant of motion when reÔ¨Çecting boundary conditions are imposed at  =

formation of apparent horizon. In the adapted coordinates if an apparent horizon forms
at point (, ) in spacetime then 2(, )‡¢ß = 1 (equivalently then the metric function
(, ) drops to zero). The drawback of the coordinate system (3.57) is that whenever a
black-hole forms the evolution freezes while a Ô¨Ånite precision in numerical calculations
causes the code to break.

and the scalar Ô¨Åeld are even functions of . We set (, 0) = 0 so that  is the proper
time at the center of adopted coordinate system.
The boundary condition and the requirement of smoothness imply that the coeÔ¨É-

3.4 Yang-Mills on Einstein Universe
A disadvantage of previous models is their complexity‚Äîthe Einstein equations, even
when restricted to spherical symmetry, form a set of coupled elliptic-hyperbolic PDEs.
Thus their analytical analysis is quite involved, but not completely impossible as we

Chapter 3. Models

39

demonstrate in this thesis. Therefore we intent to study the system describing evolution
of nonlinear waves on a curved background‚Äîthe spherically symmetric YM Ô¨Åeld prop-
agating on the Einstein Universe. This not only reduces the problem to a single NLW
equation but also under some restrictions stays in direct connection with the studies of
AdS as we demonstrate below.
We consider the YM Ô¨Åeld with (2) gauge group on a ( + 1) dimensional space-
 (where  the are usual gener-
(3.77)

time (√Ø, ). Given the YM potential  =‡¢£3

ators of the (2) algebra) the Ô¨Åeld-strength two-form is

 =  ‚àí  + [, ].

=1 

The YM action written in terms of  is

 = √û Tr √ù‚àí d+1,

(3.78)
where trace is computed over the gauge group indices. The Euler-Lagrange equation
for the action is
(3.79)
We note that if we consider a manifold ( ƒÆ√Ø, ƒÆ) with the conformally related metric

‡¢ü  + [,  ] = 0.

(3.80)

 = 2 ƒÆ,

 √ù‚àí = ‚àí3 ƒÆ ƒÆ √ù‚àí ƒÆ.

and the YM potential ƒÆ =  on ( ƒÆ√Ø, ƒÆ) then the integrand (3.78) transforms as

(3.81)
This shows that the YM theory is conformally invariant only for  = 3, and then the
Ô¨Åeld equations (3.79) have the same form when expressed in terms of ƒÆ and . There-
fore taking into account conformal structure of AdS instead of studying the YM Ô¨Åeld
propagating on AdS4 we study this problem posed in four dimensional Einstein Uni-
verse which technically translates to extending the domain from upper hemisphere to
the whole 3-sphere. In this way we overcome the ambiguity of boundary conditions
at the conformal boundary of AdS which is regular for the YM Ô¨Åeld in  = 3 space
dimensions.
Global existence for the YM Ô¨Åeld equation on AdS4 was proved in [46] (with the
‚Äôno Ô¨Çux‚Äô boundary conditions at timelike inÔ¨Ånity), while extension to general globally
hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds was carried in [50].

3.4.1 Equations of motion
We consider the YM Ô¨Åeld propagating on the Einstein Universe

where the metric on a round 3 is

d2 = ‚àí d2 + d2

d2

with coordinate ranges ,  ‡¢† [0, ] and  ‡¢† [0, 2).

3.4. Yang-Mills on Einstein Universe

The most general, spherically symmetric SU(2) connection in (3 + 1) dimensions

can be written as [160]

 = 1 3 d + 2 3 d + (3 1 + 4 2) d

+ (cot  3 + 3 2 ‚àí 4 1) sin  d,

 =  1 d + (cot  3 +  2) sin  d.

For this particular ansatz the YM curvature (3.77) is

(3.84)
where 1, 2, 3 and 4 are real functions depending on ,  and (1, 2, 3) is the
standard basis of su(2) Lie algebra. To simplify (3.84) further we take purely magnetic
ansatz [45, 130]. Then making the suitable gauge choices we can set all  but 3 to
zero. The reduced YM connection with 3 ‡£ï  is

(3.86)
where we use the notation ƒ≥‡£ï  and ﬂ∞ ‡£ï . The action functional (3.78) reduces to

 = 4√û
(3.87)
The Euler-Lagrange equation for this action gives the YM equation for the potential 

The equation (3.88) has a reÔ¨Çection symmetry which means that if  is a solution of

with ƒ≤2 being a free parameter. All higher order terms in the expansions (3.91) and
(3.92) are uniquely determined by the leading order expansion coeÔ¨Écients 2 and ƒ≤2
respectively. Using shooting method we have found only two smooth static solutions
to (3.90) (up to the reÔ¨Çection symmetry  ‡¢ê ‚àí): the trivial solution () = 1 (vac-
uum) with vanishing YM curvature (3.86) and zero total energy  = 0 and the non-
trivial conÔ¨Åguration () = cos  (kink) with the total energy  = 3‡¢ß8 (the solution
found in [93] for the Einstein-Yang-Mills system). In the following, without loose of
generality, we assume  (, 0) = 1. These static solutions separate the phase space of
solutions of the equation (3.88) into two topologically distinct sectors: solutions with
 (, 0) =  (, ) = 1 and solutions with  (, 0) = ‚àí (, ) = 1. This means, that
any solution to equation (3.88) starting in one of the topological sectors must stay in
that sector during smooth time evolution. We begin the analysis of solutions for each of
the topological sectors by solving the equation governing linear perturbations around
static solutions.

3.4.3 Linear perturbations‚Äîthe eigenvalue problem
We consider smooth solutions of (3.88) of the form

 (, ) = () + (, ),

(3.93)
where () is one of the static solutions of (3.90) and (, ) is a perturbation fulÔ¨Ålling
regularity conditions at both poles of 3, i.e. the (, ) is even function of  at  = 0
and  = . Substituting (3.93) into (3.88) we obtain the evolution equation for the
perturbation (, ) of the static solution ()

 + 3 + 
sin2 
which can be written in a following canonical form

ƒ¥ ‚àí ﬂ∞ﬂ∞ + 32 ‚àí 1

2 = 0,

are positive the cor-
responding static solutions are linearly stable.
Theeigenfunctions(3.102)forvacuumandkinkstaticsolutionsareidentical, which
is a direct consequence of the fact that the linear operators (3.96) for both of the static
 = . The eigenfunctions (3.102) have exactly ( ‚àí 1) zeroes,

they are alternately even and odd, with respect to the equator of the three-sphere, for
 = 1, 3, ‚Ä¶ they are even functions of argument , whereas for  = 2, 4, ‚Ä¶ they are
odd functions, i.e. we have () = (‚àí1)+1( ‚àí ). Their Taylor series expansions
√ù( + 2)
at the poles are, for  = 0

(3.104)
and similarly for  =  using the symmetry of (). Therefore the expansions of ()
conform with the regularity conditions for the nonlinear problem (3.94) and whence
can be used as an expansion functions of smooth solutions in both the numerical and
perturbative calculations.
Another important feature concerns the derived spectrum of linear perturbations.
The eigenvalues for vacuum and kink static solutions correspond to nondispersive and
dispersive cases respectively.
In the former case, frequencies of the linear problem
are equally spaced integer numbers  =  + 1 (starting with 1 = 2). For the kink

Turbulence, resonances and
(in)stability

In this chapter we consider generic behaviour of nonlinear waves propagating on
bounded domains. We focus on the problem how the dispersive and nondispersive
spectrum of linear perturbations aÔ¨Äects the nonlinear dynamics. We investigate this
issue by studying models of Sections 3.3 and 3.4, which give us a possibility to change
thecharacteroftheeigenvaluesbyconsideringdiÔ¨Äerentboundaryconditions(thescalar
Ô¨Åeld case) or by considering perturbations in diÔ¨Äerent topological sectors (the YM Ô¨Åeld
model).
In addition we give the details of numerical methods used to solve the evolution
equations. For the YM model we present the results of perturbative methods which
serve as a starting point in the construction of time-periodic solutions. We point out
that the nondispersive spectrum does not forbid the resonances to occur.
The Ô¨Årst part of this chapter is based mainly on the paper [111] and in part on more
recent work presented in [114].

cretization, has an advantage of spectral convergence when the solution stays smooth
duringtime evolution. Thisapproach wasusedto solvetheinitial-boundary valueprob-
lem for the system (4.2)-(4.5) for the Ô¨Årst time by the author in [114]; it is also a core

4.1.1 Numerical evolution scheme
Finite diÔ¨Äerence method
We take a numerical grid for the radial coordinate  ‡¢† [0, 1] with  equally spaced
points (grid nodes)

 = ( ‚àí 1)√í,

 = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶ , ,

(4.6)
where √í = 1‡¢ß( ‚àí 1) is the grid spacing constant. We discretize the equations (4.2)-
(4.5) with Ô¨Ånite diÔ¨Äerence method of fourth order in grid spacing √í [107]. In this way
we obtain a system of 2 coupled ODEs for the () ‡£ï (, ), () ‡£ï (, ),
 = 1, ‚Ä¶ ,  dependent variables (the discretized version of equations (4.4), (4.5)),
with  being a continuous independent variable, subject to a discrete version of elliptic
constraint equations (discussed below). Resulting system is solved by using ‚Äôstandard‚Äô
numerical algorithms for the integration of ODEs; This is commonly known the MOL
approach (or semi-discretization [95]). Concerning the Einstein equations, the prob-
lem we are facing, we use the constrained evolution scheme [2]. Instead of using the
momentum constraint to update the metric function (, ), we solve the Hamiltonian
constraint, which is particularly advantageous in spherical symmetry when using polar-
areal coordinates. This, together with a need to solve the slicing condition, implies that
for any numerical method used to advance solution in time the constraint equations
have to be solved very often, precisely at each intermediate step of the time integra-
tion algorithm. This is the reason why the Einstein equations, viewed as a coupled
system of hyperbolic and elliptic PDEs, are very expensive to solve and with no sym-
metry assumptions a free evolution scheme is commonly used (though application of
advanced techniques like multi-grid methods‚Ä† may substantially reduce the complexity
of solving the constraint equations [43], these require much more eÔ¨Äort to be adopted
and implemented to the problems at hand than the use of free evolution). Therefore any
feasible enhancement of the algorithm solving the constraints will result in a signiÔ¨Åcant
gain of performance of the overall algorithm used to solve the time dependent Einstein
equations. This is the reason why we prefer to solve the system (4.2)-(4.5) instead of
(3.59)-(3.62).

This system is solved using banded version of the LU factorization algorithm [95].
Since the matrix (4.9) is constant (time-independent), the factorization is performed
only once, during the initialization, and the cost of solving the system (4.7), (4.8) is
 (20) (not including computing the RHS), while the factorization cost is between

4.1. Spherical cavity model

This again is solved with the use of the LU factorization, so the complexity of the al-
gorithm to compute a solution to the Hamiltonian constraint is of the same order as
for solving the slicing condition. This should be compared with the cost of solving
(3.61) directly where the resulting main matrix (after performing the FDA discretiza-
tion), being time-dependent through its dependence on the scalar Ô¨Åeld, would have to
be factorized at each time which would at least double an overall complexity.
The RHS of the FDA discretized evolution equations (4.4) and (4.5) are written in
terms of the  Ô¨Åeld instead of its spatial derivative, the  Ô¨Åeld introduced in (3.58).
After performing dozens of numerical experiments, using diÔ¨Äerent schemes imposing
the boundary conditions at the cavity, we found that the problem of solving (4.2)-(4.5)
or equivalently (3.59)-(3.61) is unstable when  is used instead of  (this is also the
case for a free wave equation written in terms of corresponding quantities to  and ).
For that reason, in the FDA approach we are forced to evolve in time the scalar Ô¨Åeld 
instead of its gradient.
At the interior of the grid, i.e. for the grid points  = 2, ‚Ä¶ ,  ‚àí 1 the discrete
version of (4.4) and (4.5) reads
ƒ≥ = ,
ƒ≥ = 

(4.13)
(4.14)
For the node  = 1 located at the origin  = 0, where equation (4.5) is singular, we cal-
culate the RHS using l‚ÄôHopital‚Äôs rule which together with regularity conditions (3.65)
gives

at the  = 1, ‚Ä¶ ,  ‚àí 3 grid points. We deliberately do not modify the time derivatives
at the last three grid points ( =  ‚àí 2,  ‚àí 1, ) in order not to aÔ¨Äect imposed
boundary conditions. The correct choice of the order of the dissipation operator 
and its strength, the free parameter , which from linear stability analysis has to be
0 ‡£ò  < 1, ensures that the order of accuracy of the FDA scheme is not aÔ¨Äected. In
practice, it was suÔ¨Écient to set  = 0.01 or  = 0.1 in this problem.¬ß Due to the used
scheme (especially (4.10) and (4.11)) and the sparsity of discrete FDA operators the
overall cost of computing RHS of evolution equations (4.4) and (4.5) is (). Since
for large and moderate amplitudes of initial perturbations high gradients appear and
Ô¨Ånally the black hole forms we take very large number of grid points, usually  is
of order 214 ‚àí 216, to resolve Ô¨Åne structures of the solution. Therefore the use of an
energyconservingtime-integrationmethod, theGauss-Runge-Kuttamethod(discussed
in Appendix C.3), would greatly aÔ¨Äect the overall performance. Such method requires
large grids would be a signiÔ¨Åcant additional cost. Hence, we prefer to use an explicit
method and the time-integration of evolution equations is done using an adaptive‚Äîself
adjustingtimestepsize, explicitRunge-Kutta-Dormand-Princealgorithm[60](seealso
the Appendix C.2). For stability reasons time step is of order 1‡¢ß, thus an overall
complexity of the evolution scheme (cost of integrating the equations per unit time
tests conÔ¨Årming our choice and robustness of this approach.

strength of dissipation.

Pseudospectral method
To discretize the system of equations (4.2)-(4.5) we use the Chebyshev pseudospectral
method adapted to spherical symmetry, which is described in detail in Appendix B. We
take  +1 radial Chebyshev points, given in Eq. (B.13) and evolve in time the values of
the dynamical Ô¨Åelds at the grid nodes; we use the following notation () ‡£ï (,  =
) and () ‡£ï (,  = ) for  = 0, 1, ‚Ä¶ ,  (where we drop the time dependence
for convenience). As in the FDA approach, the constraint equations, after performing
disretization in space, become algebraic equations for the function values at the grid
points. The discrete version of the slicing condition (4.2) is then

Because of the stiÔ¨Äness of the resulting ODE system (the property of Chebyshev
pseudospectralmethod)weareforcedtouseanimplicittime-integrationalgorithmhere
[88, 84]. The implicit methods are more costly per time step than the explicit ones, but
their stability properties put less stringent restrictions of the magnitude of integration
step [84] (thus it suÔ¨Éces to take time step size of order (1‡¢ß) with implicit RK meth-
ods, while explicit RK restricts integration step to (1‡¢ß2)). Also due to the spectral
convergence of the spatial discretization, usually we do not need to take  to be large
(in practice not greater than 28) in order to provide an accurate approximation to the
solution for this problem, at least for smooth solutions. For ODEs of moderate sizes
the use of an implicit time integrator does not cause signiÔ¨Åcant increase of computa-
tional cost compared to the cost of computing the RHS of the equations. In addition,

The results are very similar to those of [28], as can be seen by comparing Figs. 4.3
and 4.4 with the analogues Ô¨Ågures in [28]. For large amplitudes the evolution is not
aÔ¨Äected by the mirror; the wave packet rapidly collapses, forming an apparent horizon
at a point where the metric function (, ) goes to zero. However, a wave packet which
is marginally too weak to form a horizon on the Ô¨Årst implosion, does so on the second
implosion after being reÔ¨Çected back by the mirror. As in the AdS case, this leads to
a sequence of critical amplitudes  for which the solutions, after making  bounces,
asymptote locally Choptuik‚Äôs critical solution (see Fig. 4.3). The snapshots of the time-
evolution showing continuous narrowing of scalar Ô¨Åeld proÔ¨Åles with increasing time is
shown on Fig. 4.2 (for  = 8 in (4.48) the black hole is formed after 36 reÔ¨Çections).
To track the steepening of the wave packet for very small amplitudes, we follow [28]
and monitor the Ricci scalar at the origin, i.e. we plot (, 0) = ‚àí2(, 0)2. This

integration algorithm does not improve the convergence since an overall error is domi-
nated by the lower order spatial discretization). The variation of convergence factor for

of exponential growth  scales with the amplitude of initial data as  √ü ‚àí2, which
indicates that arbitrarily small perturbations (for which it is impossible numerically to
track the formation of a horizon) eventually start growing.
In [28] the numerical results were corroborated by a nonlinear perturbation analy-
sis which demonstrated that the instability of AdS is caused by the resonant transfer of
energy from low to high frequencies. For the problem at hand, as in AdS, the spectrum
is fully resonant (that is, the frequencies  are rational multiples of one another), so
the entire perturbation analysis of [28] can be formally repeated in our case. We say
‚Äôformally‚Äô because, in contrast to the AdS case, the eigenmodes (3.71) violate the com-

The growth of ƒØ() in time means that the distribution of energy shifts from low to high
frequencies. The characteristic staircase shape of ƒØ() indicates that the energy transfer
occurs mainly during the subsequent implosions through the center. This observation
leads to the conclusion that the only role of the mirror is to reÔ¨Çect the pulse so that it
can be focused during the next implosion.
Another aspect of the turbulent cascade is shown in Fig. 4.6 which depicts the spec-
trum of energy (that is, the distribution of the total energy over the linear modes) for
the solution with initial data (4.48) and  = 6. Initially, the energy is concentrated in

a numerical error) which indicates that the exponent  is universal. We note that the
power-law spectrum with a similar exponent was also observed in the AdS case. As
pointed out in [28], the black hole formation provides a cut-oÔ¨Ä for the turbulent energy
cascade for solutions of Einstein‚Äôs equations (in analogy to viscosity in the case of the
Navier-Stokes equation). It is natural to conjecture that the power-law decay is a conse-

that the analogous scaling in the Neumann boundary case, depicted on Fig. 4.7, did not
seem compelling enough, it was concluded by the author in [111] in quest of further
robustness that (...) the spectrum of linearized perturbations need not be fully resonant
for triggering the instability.
On the other hand the authors of [58] came to the opposite conclusion based on the
nonlinear perturbation analysis. The clash between those two statements became even
more prominent with the discovery of concrete examples of (nonlinearly) stable aAdS
solutions [112], previously advocated in [58] and the question what makes them im-
mune to the instability discovered in [28]. Thus we developed Chebyshev pseudospec-
tral spatial discretization for the system (4.2)-(4.5) and used symplectic time-integrator
with the aim of performing high precision, long-time, stable, energy conserving evo-
lution with an even smaller amplitudes than considered before. The solutions for the
same family of initial data (4.48) are depicted in Fig. 4.8. For the Neumann boundary
condition we found that the scaling (shown at Fig. 4.7) does not improve as we decrease
the amplitude, while for  ‡£† 1 (for this concrete family of initial perturbations, given
in (4.48)) the instability is not triggered at all. However, the scalar Ô¨Åeld (, ) exhibits
direct scaling with an amplitude  of initial perturbation, as is shown on Fig. 4.9, and

Figure 4.8: Top panel. The function (, 0) for solutions with Neumann boundary con-
dition at the cavity with initial data (4.48) for small amplitude shows very diÔ¨Äerent
behaviour as opposed to moderate and large perturbations, compare with Fig. 4.7. Bot-
tom panel. The spectral code (described in Section 4.1.1) together with symplectic
Gauss-RK integration method (see Appendix C.3) with small enough time step is able
to conserve the total mass (3.64) up to √ü 2.5 √ó 10‚àí15 (the absolute error) over long in-
tegration times. The 256 radial Chebyshev points were used to produces these results.

no growth of the Ricci scalar occurs over relatively long times‚Äîin fact the magnitude
of oscillations slightly decreases. There is no indication of scaling previously observed
for the Dirichlet case (see Fig. 4.4), after the rescaling by the initial amplitude the signal
registered by the central observer almost converges for early times, while for late times
we observe phase shift between the signals of diÔ¨Äerent amplitudes (bottom panels on
Fig. 4.9).

the cavity, it also spreads over the entire spatial domain very fast (this is clearly visi-
ble on the  = 200 panel; compare red (Dirichlet) and blue (Neumann) proÔ¨Åles). This
feature is also apparent on a signal registered at the center, shown on Figs. 4.8 and 4.9.
Because waves with diÔ¨Äerent lengths are reaching the center at diÔ¨Äerent times (lack of
coherence) the signal is no longer a sharp peak, it gets more wavy at late time. More-
over the energy conservation implies that the signal has to have smaller amplitude. The
results of performed simulations illustrate the main diÔ¨Äerences between the evolutions

with diÔ¨Äerent reÔ¨Çecting boundary conditions imposed on the cavity.
The spreading (or its lack) is caused by the dispersive (or nondisperive) character of
the spectrum of linear perturbation operator (which was derived in Section 3.3.3). On
theotherhand, thereisagravitationalfocusingpresent(thenonlineareÔ¨Äect)actingover
very long time (many successive implosions). The fate of initial perturbation depends
on whether the focusing eÔ¨Äect dominates the dispersion‚Äîthe signal gets compressed
and Ô¨Ånally the black hole forms‚Äîor focusing by gravity cannot overcome the spreading
and the evolution stays smooth. This can be controlled by the size of initial perturbation
(the amplitude  of gaussian perturbation in our case). This explains the behaviour we
observeforlargeandmoderateamplitudes, seeFig.4.7, whenthegravitationalfocusing
dominates the dispersion (which is inevitably present when the Neumann boundary
condition is imposed on cavity), while for small perturbations, Fig. 4.8, the evolution is
dominated by the dispersion. In contrast, for the Dirichlet boundary condition, where
the dispersion is absent, all generic perturbations are expected to collapse regardless of
their size. This conclusion is based on an extrapolation of the observed scaling shown
onFig.4.4, whichimproveswhenwedecreaseamplitude. Thereexistsalsonon-generic
perturbationswhichdonottriggerblackholeformation, asfortheAdScase[112],these
are time-periodic solutions and will be the subject of Section 5.4.
The competition of dispersion and focusing is also visible on Fig. 4.11 showing
Chebyshev decomposition of the function proÔ¨Åles,  and , plotted on accompanying
Fig. 4.10. The broadening range of excited Chebyshev coeÔ¨Écients in the resonant case
signals the need to use larger number of polynomials to represent Ô¨Åne structures of
approximated functions; the focusing eÔ¨Äect of gravity causes the energy to concentrate
on smaller scales. This continuous transfer of energy to progressively smaller scales is
the main diÔ¨Éculty in numerical simulations.
Clearly the attractive property of spectral methods, the inÔ¨Ånite-order convergence
(also called spectral accuracy), is lost when the approximated functions are not smooth
(lose derivatives, become discontinuous or form shocks). Such a loss of regularity
seriously degrades the rate of convergence of spectral approximations and makes the
method ineÔ¨Äective. Sometimes the postprocessing methods like Ô¨Åltering or the Gibbs
complementary basis technique can be used to deal with Gibbs phenomena [88] and
recover high-order accuracy, however the applicability of these methods to the problem
at hand is questionable. Since the FD methods are computationally less costly (the lin-
ear versus quadratic complexity in our problem) the number of degrees of freedom can
be greately increased to achieve accurate results by resolving Ô¨Åne features of the solu-
tion. This ‚Äôbrute force‚Äô approach has a natural limitation due to Ô¨Ånite computational
resources. However for solutions staying smooth, which is the case for the Neumann
boundary conditions, the spectral methods greatly outperform FD discretization.
Since in the nonresonant case the dispersion dominates over the focusing eÔ¨Äects,
the late time spectra of Chebyshev coeÔ¨Écients oscillate around some equilibrium state
for arbitrarily long times and higher order polynomials are not excited above the thresh-
old determined by Ô¨Ånite numerical precision (here the double Ô¨Çoating-point precision).
Therefore, there is a Ô¨Ånite range of Chebyshev polynomials needed to accurately rep-
resent solution, and thanks to the spectral convergence this number is not very large
(in practice we have used at most 256 Chebyshev modes). This makes the method pre-
sented in Section 4.1.1 a very robust tool (justiÔ¨Åed by the total mass conservation test
and its result shown on Fig. 4.8) for solving the Cauchy problem with Neumann bound-
ary condition and small initial amplitudes. Additionally, this approach for the spatial
discretization of the Ô¨Åeld equations constitutes the main component of the numerical
methods used to Ô¨Ånd time-periodic solutions in Section 5.4.

numerical integration [134]. The algebraic equations (4.57) are solved using LU factor-
ization of the eigenbasis matrix which appears on the RHS. Thus the overall theoretical
cost of computing the RHS is of order (22). The advantage of using the eigenbasis
() as expansion functions in (4.54) is threefold. First, the boundary conditions at the
poles of three-sphere are automatically satisÔ¨Åed (see also discussion in Appendix B);
second, the linear part of the equation (4.56) can be computed exactly; and Ô¨Ånally, this
allows for a direct comparison with perturbative calculations.
The total energy of a perturbation , expressed by the integral (3.99), can be com-

where ,  ‡¢º [0, ]  R are smooth functions, fulÔ¨Ålling the regularity conditions‚Äî
being even functions of  at both poles of 3. We consider initial conditions with single
eigenmode only. For such restricted initial conditions the derivation of perturbative
solutions is straightforward and the systematic analysis is relatively easy‚Äîfor more
generic data this would be hardly possible. The results of such analysis gives insight
into the dynamics because they reveal the structure of interactions between the eigen-
modes coupled through nonlinearity. In particular it shows that for the dispersive case
resonances are equally common as for the nondispersive case. Moreover, these pertur-
bative calculations will serve as a starting point in the construction of time-periodic
solutions. Motivated by this we impose the following initial data

(4.66)
where  ‡¢† N is a Ô¨Åxed eigenmode index and the amplitude  will serve as an expansion
parameter.

(0, ) =  (),

Poincar√©-Lindstedt method
Due to the nonlinearity of the Eq. (3.94), it is natural to expect that the coeÔ¨Écient of the
eigenmode () will no longer be a harmonic function oscillating with the eigenmode
natural frequency . We assume that its oscillation frequency () will depend on
the magnitude of initial data and will reduce to  in the limit  ‡¢ê 0. To simplify the
perturbative calculation we introduce the new time variable by the simple rescaling

 = () .

2 +  + csc2  (3 + ) 2 = 0,
(we use notation set in (3.96) for the linear diÔ¨Äerential operator ). Then, we expand
both, the solution  and the frequency , in power series in 

The  are unknown constants to be determined by the requirement that all  are uni-
formly bounded for  ‡¢ê √ù. Plugging (4.69) and (4.70) into (4.67) and performing
Taylor expansion in  we get a series of initial value problems for the ; we give here

The solution of (4.71) with inital conditions (4.66) is

(4.75)
The higher order equations, in particular (4.72)-(4.74), are solved as follows. We as-
sume that at the order  ‡£ô 2 the solution is given as a linear combination of the eigen-
basis functions
(4.76)
Then, projecting a particular perturbative equation onto the successive eigenmodes we
Ô¨Ånd that the evolution of the expansion coeÔ¨Écients ƒÆ,() in (4.76) is governed by the

where (, ) denote the source terms of the perturbative equations (the Ô¨Årst three of
them are the RHSs of Eqs. (4.72)-(4.74)). Solving these with the zero initial conditions
(4.78)
(coming from our choice (4.66)) we determine the unique solution. It turns out that
at each perturbative order  ‡£ô 2 the system (4.77) is Ô¨Ånite, since the RHS vanishes
for  > ‡¢©(, ), this implies that the solution (4.76) is a Ô¨Ånite combination of the
eigenmodes.
It may happen that the projection on a given mode  contains the frequency ‡¢ß.
Such terms give rise the secular terms in solution ƒÆ,, i.e. terms which grow linearly
withtime  (theratio ‡¢ß doesnothavetobeanintegernumber). Theideabehindthe
transformation (4.67) and the associated perturbative expansion (4.70) is to use the free
parameters  to systematically remove secular terms appearing in successive orders of
perturbativecalculation. Since, thereisonlyonesuchparameteravailableateachorder,

(0) = 0,

68

4.2. Yang-Mills on Einstein Universe

whenever there appear more then one secular terms, due to the resonant interactions
between consecutive orders of perturbative expansion, the scheme breaks down.
We show in the following that the Poincar√©-Lindstedt method applied to the consid-
ered problem yields the(4) accurate, uniformly bounded result for both the resonant
and nonresonant cases but it breaks down at the 4th order due to an unremovable res-
onance. There is one special case for the perturbations of the kink solution with the
fundamental mode,  = 1 case, where the perturbative procedure can be continued in-
deÔ¨Ånitely with no secular terms appearing at all. Below we present the results of the
perturbative calculations and point out their drawbacks by comparing them with the
numerical solution. Since the resonant and nonresonant cases are distinct we consider
them separately. In the following section we show how using a multiple-scale approach
get one can perturbative formulae which provide better approximations of solutions.

Vacuum sector perturbations A careful analysis of generated perturbative series
solutions, for several choices of  in the Ô¨Årst order approximation (4.75), gives the

For odd  there are only odd eigenmodes present in the solution, whereas the even
modes are excited only for even  at odd perturbative orders. The expansion of  also
depends on the parity of , namely for even  there are only even powers of  in (4.70)
present, while for  odd this perturbative series has no Ô¨Åxed parity.
Itturnsoutthatatthefourthordertherearealwaysmorethanoneresonancespresent

The resonance for () can always be removed by a suitable choice of the frequency
shift parameter 3. Thus the number of resonances at the fourth perturbative order is
equal ( + 1) or , depending of the parity of .
Here we give the fourth order accurate result of calculations for  = 1 (the simplest
case), which includes the frequency expansion

good approximation for the coeÔ¨Écient ƒÆ1(), however it does not describe its small am-

solution for ƒÆ3() contains the secular term (see Eq. (4.84)). The perturbative solution
is thus expected to break down at time  √ü 1‡¢ß(2 3). This is indeed visible on the bot-
tom graph, while for early times ( ‡£† 500) the amplitude of the mode grows linearly in
time, it then decreases‚Äîthe long-time evolution of ƒÆ3() exhibits beating oscillations.
This indicates some kind of recurrence in this system, the energy initially deposed in
fundamental mode moves to higher modes and then returns almost periodically. The
regular perturbation expansion fails to predict this eÔ¨Äect.

which up to the Ô¨Åfth order is approximated with only two eigenmodes 1() and 3().
Note the presence of the secular term in the coeÔ¨Écient of the 3() mode, as given by
(4.82). Fig.4.12showsthecomparisonof(4.83)and(4.84)withthenumericalsolution.
Whereas the perturbative solution provides good approximation to the true solution for
moderate values of  and early times, it fails to predict the long-time behaviour of the
solution. The secular term in (4.84) destroys the approximation to ƒÆ3(), where we ob-
serve beating oscillations in numerical solution. The similar structure, the amplitude
modulation of ƒÆ1(), as read oÔ¨Ä from Eqs. (4.83) and (4.84), is also not recovered by
Poincar√©-Lindstedt method.‚Ä† To summarize, the derived expansion explains character-
vides reasonable approximation for times of order  ‡£†3‚àí1. Due to large number
istic staircase energy spectra for a single mode initial conditions, see Fig. 4.13, and pro-
of unremovable resonances the Poincar√©-Lindstedt method does not give a uniformly
bounded approximation; it also fails to reproduce observed amplitude modulations of
the eigenmodes.
In order to obtain a better approximation we will use a multiple-scale approach and
show here the results for this particular case ( = 1), but Ô¨Årst we apply the Poincar√©-
Lindstedt method to the dispersive case.
Kink sector perturbations The analogous analysis for the perturbations of the kink
solution  = cos  leads to very similar result for the eigenmode decomposition

Here in contrast to the previous case, for even  the solution consist of even eigenmodes
only (the frequency expansion has both even and odd terms), while for odd  th solution
contains alsothe odd modespresent at oddperturbative orders(the frequency isan even
function in ).
‚Ä†Even if we continue the perturbative calculation in order to obtain better approximation to the true
solution, allowing in the same time for secular terms, we would get only the secular term 6 in ƒÆ1() and no
terms which recover the Ô¨Åne structure of time evolution of ƒÆ1().

Figure 4.13: The energy spectra (with energy of eigenmode  deÔ¨Åned in Eq. (4.62))
for a single eigenmode initial data (4.66) exhibits characteristic staircase form. Due to
the nonlinear interactions, the eigenmodes are excited in groups of comparable ampli-
tudes. This structure is correctly predicted by the perturbative calculation. To empha-
size the separation between the eigenmode clusters we have taken small initial ampli-
tude  = 10‚àí6. This forced us to use the extended precision arithmetic calculations,
with up to 200 signiÔ¨Åcant digits, carried by the Mathematica. Here we plot the snap-
shot at  = 2, at later times the character of the spectra stays unaltered. Top panel.
The vacuum perturbation by eigenmode  = 10. At the leading order, excluding ()
which dominates the evolution, there are 1(), 3(), ‚Ä¶ , 19() present, a lower order
contribution is due to eigenmodes 2(), 4(), ‚Ä¶ , 30(), and 1(), 3(), ‚Ä¶ , 39()
are excited at fourth order, as stated in (4.79)-(4.81). Bottom panel. The kink pertur-
bation with eigenmode  = 18. Due to the symmetry, only even modes are excited for
that case. Here again the perturbative result (4.85)-(4.87) predicts observed spectra; the
highest index of excited eigenmode is 36 in second, 54 in third and 72 in fourth order.

The secular terms at fourth order are produced for the eigenmodes (for  ‡£î 1)

{2()  = 1, ‚Ä¶ , } √û {()},

(4.88)
and the secular term for the eigenmode  can always be eliminated by correctly setting
the value of the parameter 3. So there are  or ( ‚àí 1) resonant terms (depending of
the parity of ) at fourth order. The case  = 1 is special in the sense that there appears
only one resonance (for the eigenmode 1()) at any order  ‡£ô 2. This resonant term
can be removed by setting ‚àí1 = 0. Therefore, for the fundamental eigenmode per-
turbation of the kink solution the nonlinearity does not aÔ¨Äect the oscillation frequency.
Secondly, because of lack of additional resonances, since we can remove resonances
at each perturbative order, the Poincar√©-Lindstedt method gives a uniformly bounded
approximation up to an arbitrarily high order.
Here, as an example, we give the fourth order accurate solution for  = 1 (for  > 1

Note the presence of both rational and irrational frequencies in the above formula.
In this special case (lack of secular terms) the perturbative result (which is uniformly
bounded) provides satisfactory approximation to the numerical data, see Fig. 4.14. A
very slow growth of diÔ¨Äerence between the numerical and analytical solutions is due to
the systematic change in phase of the signals (both numerical and analytical solutions
staybounded). Thiserrorisreducedwithorderofperturbativeapproximation. Wehave
noted that phase error increases with . We show the  = 2 case on Fig. 4.15, which is
qualitatively similar to  = 1 except that we get one secular term in the ƒÆ4() coeÔ¨Écient,
see Eq. (4.88). The fourth order accurate approximation contains only even modes, up
to 8(), as given in (4.85)-(4.87). For the coeÔ¨Écient ƒÆ2() the perturbative result is
suÔ¨Écient, while for higher modes, the ƒÆ6() shown here, we observe a signiÔ¨Åcant phase
shift with respect to numerical solution. In that case, the Poincar√©-Lindstedt method is
capable to capture the slow modulation of fast oscillations, especially for early times.

should be removed when even slower time scales (like 4) were included. Nonethe-
less, using multiple-scale approach we where able to provide the approximation to the
system (4.91), which reproduces beating oscillations of the amplitude ƒÆ3(). This is
seen on Fig. 4.16, where we compare the perturbative result, including only the leading
order terms, i.e. Ô¨Årst order for ƒÆ1() as given in Eq. (4.101), and the second order ap-
proximation to ƒÆ3(), the formula (4.105). The beating oscillation of the former is quite
well recovered, as opposed to the Poincar√©-Lindstedt method, while the conformity of
fast oscillations is modest. Neglecting second order approximation to ƒÆ1(), because of
presence of the secular term, we have been able to provide only the phase frequency
shift, as in previous section. However, if we look back at the starting problem of Ô¨Ånd-
ing approximate solution to (3.94) (with  = 1) and for initial conditions (4.66) with
 = 1 and regard the time evolution of solution proÔ¨Åle (, ), not its eigenmode de-

4.2.3 Generic initial perturbations
In the previous section we have compared the dynamics for nondispersive and disper-
sive cases (for perturbations of the static solutions  = 1 and  = cos  respectively)
for very simple initial conditions, namely a single mode perturbations. In both cases
dynamics looks very similar, the remaining eigenmodes are excited‚Äîthe energy Ô¨Çows
from the mode excited initially to other modes. They cluster in groups with similar
amount of energy as predicted by the perturbative calculations‚Äîa Ô¨Ånite range of modes
is excited at each perturbative order, see Eqs. (4.79)-(4.81) and (4.85)-(4.87). A char-
acteristic feature of the evolution seen in the eigenmode coeÔ¨Écients is their nontrivial
modulated oscillation. In perturbative calculation there appear a number of resonances,
for both nondispersive and dispersive cases. Due to the resulting secular term, pertur-
bative expansion method fails to produce a uniformly bounded approximation to the
solution. With multiple-scale approach we were able to predict the observed ampli-
tude modulation, at least for special case shown previously, a fundamental mode initial
conditions. Due to the nonlinear coupling between the modes dynamics is fairly com-
plicated and hard to describe analytically. Clearly, full understanding of mode interac-
tions is beyond our reach, nevertheless some more general statements concerning the
dynamics can be made.

In order to examine this problem further we analyze the dynamics for a generic
initial conditions. We choose the Gaussian like localized distribution as the initial con-
dition
(4.107)
with the amplitude,  playing the role of the control parameter. Smoothness of chosen
function proÔ¨Åle implies that the generalized Fourier coeÔ¨Écients of (0, ) fall oÔ¨Ä expo-
nentially. DuetotheglobalexistenceresultsfortheCauchyprobleminthismodel, such
solution stays smooth for all times, so its generalized Fourier coeÔ¨Écients will always
exhibit exponential fall oÔ¨Ä with no polynomial tail, in contrast to the model of previous
section. The nonlinearity would cause this spectrum to evolve in time. In this case a
perturbativecalculation, similartotheprevioussections, wouldbehardlypossible, thus
here we rely only on a numerical approach. To analyze the energy transfer, similarly to
the model of previous section, we deÔ¨Åne the Sobolev type energy norms

are labelled by diÔ¨Äerent point types. Top panel. The  = 1 case. Note the equilibration
of energy spectra. Bottom panel. In the  = cos  case the slope of energy spectra is
greater than for the vacuum case. Also the equilibrium distribution is attained much
faster.

Clearly the dynamics in these two cases are completely diÔ¨Äerent. At Ô¨Årst glance, a
noisy character of plotted quantities for the dispersive case is clearly visible, whereas in
the nondispersive case the curves are smooth. This is the sampling eÔ¨Äect which causes
the time dependence of norms for the dispersive case look irregular. It is an artifact
of probing with constant intervals the functions with irrational and rational frequencies
which is precisely the case here. A fundamental diÔ¨Äerence between these two cases
concerns the growth and oscillatory behaviour of corresponding norms.
For the nondispersive case the norms grow monotonically for early times, however
at later times they saturate and no further growth is observed. Nevertheless a variation
of norms is evident. This suggests the energy Ô¨Çow from low to high frequencies and
back (see discussion below). Such behaviour is absent in the dispersive case. For per-
turbations around kink the norms saturate very fast and stay bounded. After the initial
phase of energy transfer the energy Ô¨Çow is limited, this is also visible on a energy spec-
trum given in Fig. 4.19 where we plot the energy distribution among the modes for few

Moreover, for the nondispersive case we observe the almost reccurence to the initial
conÔ¨Åguration. If we plot the solution proÔ¨Åle at times corresponding to the local mini-
mum of higher norms (4.108), shown on Fig. 4.17, e.g. at time  = 15800 ‡£à 5 √ó 104,
the solution proÔ¨Åles almost coincide with the initial data (4.107). We say almost, be-
cause not all energy deposed in higher modes returns to the lower modes, as the slope
of the energy spectra is almost constant for large times (see Fig. 4.19) and the higher
norms do not drop to their initial values, but they decrease suÔ¨Éciently Fig. 4.17. This

4.3 Conclusions
In this chapter we have considered two models, namely the EKG system conÔ¨Åned in a
spherical perfectly reÔ¨Çecting cavity and the YM Ô¨Åeld propagating on the Einstein Uni-
verse, to study generic turbulent dynamics of nonlinear waves on bounded domains.
These studies concerned mainly the eÔ¨Äect the spectrum of linear perturbations (nondis-
persive and dispersive character) has on the global dynamics (we continue these studies
in the next chapter). The spectrum was controlled either by changing boundary condi-
tions (the EKG system) or by considering perturbations of various static solutions (the

YM equation).
Studying the EKG system in spherical cavity with Dirichlet boundary condition we
observed the growth of Ricci scalar (monitored at the origin) with time for arbitrarily
small amplitudes  of initial perturbations. The characteristic growth of this quantity
scales with  in the same ways as in the aAdS case. This scaling and its extrapolation
for  ‡¢ê 0 supports the conjecture for the instability of AdS space. We draw the same
conclusion in the case of the minimally coupled scalar Ô¨Åeld conÔ¨Åned in spherical cavity
without cosmological term. We stress that most of the energy is transferred during the
implosion of the scalar Ô¨Åeld packet through the origin. We observe diÔ¨Äerent behaviour
when the Neumann boundary condition is imposed at cavity. For large and moderate
amplitudes of perturbation we note the similar scaling. However this does not improve
whenwefurtherdecrease (incontrarytoDirichletcase). Thissuggeststheexistenceof

further energy transfer from large to small scales is stopped.
For the YM Ô¨Åeld propagating on the Einstein Universe the singularities cannot oc-
cur (due to the global existence; this is no longer true for higher dimensional spheres as
in higher dimensional Ô¨Çat spaces [21]), however the diÔ¨Äerence in the dynamics for dis-
persive and nondispersive cases (considering solutions in diÔ¨Äerent topological sectors)
is also observed. The analysis of generic initial perturbations for the YM system shows
another diÔ¨Äerence in the dynamics for the problems with diÔ¨Äerent character of the spec-
trum. The energy spectra slope in both cases equilibrates, but for dispersive spectra this
happens much faster than for the nondispersive case. This suggests the diÔ¨Äerence in the
process of energy transfer among the modes. Indeed this was observed while looking at
the time evolution of higher Sobolev type norms of these solutions. While for the per-
turbations of kink norms stay bounded for long time evolution and does not show any
particular structure the perturbations around vacuum reveal some kind of recurrent pat-
terns. Further investigation showed that the almost reccurence is actually taking place.
This indicates that the energy transfer is not unidirectional since this Ô¨Çows from high
to low frequency modes also. Moreover, each of the norms scale with the size of initial
perturbation which suggests some universal behaviour and supports the conjecture on
nonlinear stability of the vacuum static solution.
In order to gain more insight into the mechanism of the energy transfer among
the modes of linearized problem we have performed series of perturbative calculations
by considering simple‚Äîsingle mode‚Äîinitial conditions. Using naive perturbative ap-
proach we have shown that, in contrast to the expectation, the resonances are equally
present for both dispersive and nondispersive cases. Further with these simple tech-
niques we where able to explain the characteristic staircase energy spectrum. However
the Poincar√©-Lindstedt approach failed to predict the longtime mode amplitude modu-
lation (which is caused by the energy reccurence eÔ¨Äect). Due to the presence of unre-
movable resonances secular terms arise and we get an unbounded approximation valid
only on short time intervals covering only early phases of slow modulation. Evident
exception is the fundamental mode perturbation of the kink solution, which is the non-
resonant case in the sense that there are no resonances present in the naive perturbative
calculation thus we can produce a bounded approximation of arbitrary order. We have
analyzed the simple two dimensional system of ODEs approximating the fundamental
mode perturbation of vacuum static solution. With multiple-scale approach we were
able to predict beating oscillations for that ODEs. Further studies of this simple system
may give us more informations about the full problem. In particular a time-periodic so-
lutions may be constructed for that system and these, in a small amplitude limit, give an
approximate time-periodic solutions of the considered PDE. This issue requires further

4.3. Conclusions

Chapter 5
Time-periodic and stationary
solutions

In this chapter, complementary to the studies in the previous chapter, we focus on time-
periodic solutions to the equations derived in Chapter 3.
We start with an analysis of the EKG model (in Section 5.1) for which the perturba-
tive construction of time-periodic solutions seems to be the simplest one (conceptually)
among the models considered in this thesis. We develop methods applicable both to
even and odd space dimensions  (these cases diÔ¨Äer in the asymptotic behaviour of the
Ô¨Åelds near the conformal boundary of AdS+1 and need to be studied separately). Next,
in Section 5.2 we study standing waves‚Äîcomplex analogues of time-periodic solutions
of the EKG system. We construct them by the same of methods as time-periodic solu-
tions. Further, we analyze in detail the stability of standing waves, in particular we de-
rive the spectrum of their linear perturbations. In Section 5.3 we investigate pure grav-
itational time-periodic solutions within cohomogenity-two biaxial Bianchi IX ansatz.
The exponential nonlinearity of Ô¨Åeld equations requires number of modiÔ¨Åcations in
perturbative approach in comparison with the EKG system. Sections 5.4 and 5.5 are
devoted tostudies ofsystems allowing forboth resonantand nonresonant spectrum. We
examine a self-interacting scalar Ô¨Åeld in a cavity with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
conditions imposed and emphasize a very diÔ¨Äerent structure of the time-periodic solu-
tions in both cases. A very special structure of resonances for the YM system makes
the perturbative construction particularly involved especially for the solutions in the
kink topological sector. Each of the considered models illustrates diÔ¨Äerent aspects of
time-periodic solutions which gives us a broader perspective.
Each section ends with the presentation of derived solutions, analysis of methods
and their detailed discussion. Additionally we give a general summary of this chapter
in the closing Section 5.6.

The Sections 5.1 and 5.2 are based on [112] and [114] respectively.

ter in governing PDE system). We describe in detail the perturbative (Section 5.1.1)
and numerical (Section 5.1.3) methods for their construction. We stress the diÔ¨Äerences
between even and odd  cases‚Äîwe develop separate methods for even and odd space
dimensions. In perturbative calculations we stress the appearance of the exceptional
cancellation of resonant terms, which greately simpliÔ¨Åes the construction. Addition-
ally, in Section 5.1.2 we give details of spatial discretization method used in numerical
evolution scheme. Results are presented and discussed in Section 5.1.4.

We deÔ¨Åne the perturbative parameter  to be the amplitude of the mode  present at
time  = 0, which means we enforce

(5.5)
the normalization and phase Ô¨Åxing conditions (the same condition as adapted in [112];
another also convenient choice would be to Ô¨Åx the value of the scalar Ô¨Åeld at the origin
by setting (0, 0) =  at  = 0, or the one used in [63]).
Due to the incompatibility of Taylor expansions at  = ‡¢ß2 of the scalar Ô¨Åeld and
the eigenbasis functions (3.31) for odd  (as stressed in Section 3.1.3), the use of this
basiswouldnotbepracticalbothforperturbative(becauseitproducesinÔ¨Ånitesums)and
for numerical calculations (since it degrades the convergence rate). For this reason the
methods for even  presented in [112] (whose extended description we provide in the
next section) cannot be applied for odd , in particular for  = 3. This of course does
not imply that there are no time-periodic solutions to the system (3.8)-(3.11) for odd
space dimensions, there do exist time-periodic solutions for odd  and, as for even ,
they are also bifurcating from a single eigenmode. We Ô¨Årst discuss a general approach
applicable for any  ‡£ô 2, which is the only way, so far, to obtain the perturbatively
time-periodic solutions for this model when  is odd.

Such perturbative approach was applied for the Ô¨Årst time to the 3 + 1 dimensional EKG system by

J.E. Santos (private communication).

General approach for any space dimension
We take a single mode (), the solution to the linear wave equation on a Ô¨Åxed AdS+1
background, as the Ô¨Årst order solution to the coupled system (3.8)-(3.10)
(5.6)
as is already set in (5.1). At each even order  the constraint equations are solved by
use of equations (3.9) and (3.19), and their perturbative expansions, namely

1 given in (5.6) and plugging the results into the RHS of equation (5.13) we compute
the source function 3. After some elementary trigonometric manipulations this can
be rearranged to the following form

3(, ) = cos  3,1() + cos 3 3,3(),

and

 = ‚àí cos 

where we Ô¨Åx the gauge condition by taking (, 0) = 0 which implies (, 0) = 0

The evolution equations (3.8), at each odd order  ‡£ô 3, reduce to a linear inhomoge-

(5.10)
with  as given after equation (3.30) and a source term, , depending on all lower
than  order terms of the perturbative expansion (5.1)-(5.4), which is hard to write in
a concise form for general  as we did for the constraints. In particular, for  = 2 we

5.1. Einstein-Klein-Gordon system‚Äîtime-periodic solutions

3(, ) = cos  3,1() + cos 3 3,3(),

which is independent on the choice of  and . Therefore as a solution to (5.13) we
assume
(5.15)
which (by linear independence of cosines) reduces the PDE (5.13) to a system of two
decoupled second order ODEs for the Fourier modes 3,1() and 3,3(). We solve
them with Dirichlet boundary conditions 3,1(‡¢ß2) = 3,3(‡¢ß2) = 0, and since these
are second order equations we are left with two integration constants, denoted as 3,1
and 3,3, one for each of the two equations (we adopt the convention where , stands
for the integration constant appearing at order  for the -th Fourier mode).
The appearing resonances could break our construction. Since by the ansatz (5.15)
we have forced the solution to be uniformly bounded when  ‡¢ê √ù the secular terms
could not occur. However these aÔ¨Äect the spatial proÔ¨Åle and generically cause the so-
lution to be unbounded at  = 0 which violates the assumption on regularity of the
solution. The idea behind this perturbative construction (as stated in Section 2.2.1) is
remove all of the resonant terms. Here we can require  3,1
 = 0 (or equivalently
to use available integration constants , and frequency -expansion parameters  to
lim‡¢ê03,1() < √ù) by Ô¨Åxing 2, thus 3,1 stays undetermined. Further examination

 is zero for ‡¢© =  + 3 (the ‡¢© is derived from the condition 3 = ‡¢©
 3,3
shows that, Ô¨Årst of all, the possible resonant term is absent in 3,3, i.e. the projection
;
‡¢©
see [56] for rigorous proof of this statement). Cancellation of this resonance implies
that 3,3() is regular at the origin, therefore 3,3 is also an undetermined parameter
at this perturbative order. Secondly, for any odd  the function 3,3(), in contrast to
3,1(), can be written as a Ô¨Ånite linear combination eigenmodes, alike the 3,3(). To
sum up, we solve (5.13) by assuming (5.15) and integrating the resulting ODEs in 
with Dirichlet boundary conditions at  = ‡¢ß2. To remove a resonance (or equiva-
lently to ensure regularity at the origin) we Ô¨Åx the frequency correction while, the two
remaining integration constants stay undetermined (as we will see one of them remains
a free parameter, which we Ô¨Åx by the normalization condition (5.5), while the other one
will be used to remove a resonance appearing at the higher perturbative order).
The solution to the constraint equations at fourth and at any higher even order , is
in principle straightforward to get with integral formulae (5.7) and (5.9). Nevertheless,
for odd  this turns out to be very time and resource consuming task for Mathematica
especially when we take  and  to be large (in practice for  ‡£ô 5 and  ‡£ô 3). At Ô¨Åfth
order, the structure of the source function in (5.10) is very similar to that from lower
order (5.15), so are the steps we take in solving for 5(, ). Explicitly, the RHS of
(5.10) at  = 5 has the following form
(5.16)

5(, ) = cos  5,1() + cos 3 5,3() + cos 5 5,5(),

whence we assume

5(, ) = cos  5,1() + cos 3 5,3() + cos 5 5,5().

(5.17)
Asinlower  = 3order, theFouriermodebeingthehighestmultipleofthefundamental
frequency , i.e. here the function 5,5() stays regular at the origin. The regularity
conditions for the remaining coeÔ¨Écients in (5.17) can be satisÔ¨Åed by setting properly
thefrequencycorrection 4 andtheintegrationconstant 3,3. Thefreeparameterswould
be therefore 5,1, 5,3 and 5,5 (with 5,1 Ô¨Åxed by the normalization condition). The 5,3,
5,5 and 6 will be used to remove three resonances present at the next order  = 7.

Chapter 5. Time-periodic and stationary solutions

In general, for any odd  ‡£ô 3, the source function to the wave equation (5.10) has a
(5.18)
where the highest Fourier mode ,() is always a Ô¨Ånite combination of eigenmodes
(3.31) (this would not be the case for the lower modes ,1, ‚Ä¶ , ,‚àí2 in odd ; for 
even all Fourier modes of  are Ô¨Ånite combinations of eigenmodes‚Äîwe use this fact
in the following section). Also, the exceptional cancellation
(5.19)
occurs at each order  for the eigenmode ‡¢© whose frequency ‡¢©
is a -th multiple of
the fundamental frequency  of a given time-periodic solution we are constructing,
i.e.
(5.20)

 = ‡¢©  ‡¢© = ( ‚àí 1)

This regular structure implies the following. The form of the source (5.18) suggests

(5.21)
where there are ( + 1)‡¢ß2 integration constants present in (, ) one for each of
( + 1)‡¢ß2 Fourier modes (when we force the boundary condition (, ‡¢ß2) = 0).
Additionally forcing the normalization condition (5.5) Ô¨Åxes one of them and we are left
with ( + 1)‡¢ß2 ‚àí 1 integration constants after solving the order . In the next odd per-
turbative order  + 2 there will be ( + 1)‡¢ß2 + 1 terms in (5.21) present, therefore we
shouldexpect thesamenumberofresonances toappear(oneresonance foreachFourier
component). At Ô¨Årst glance it appears that we have not enough parameters to remove
all the resonances, but it turns out not to be the case. At each order we have also the
frequency expansion parameter (5.4), and moreover, as pointed earlier, the resonance
to the highest Fourier mode is always absent so the number of available parameters
matches exactly the number of resonances and is equal ( + 1)‡¢ß2 in any perturbative
order +2. Thefreedomwehavetosettheintegrationconstantsgivesusthepossibility
to cancel all appearing resonances order by order.
We note that this scheme applies at the lowest nontrivial perturbative order  = 3,
where we have only one free parameter, namely 2, while there are two possible res-
onances to occur, for frequencies  and 3. Because of the exceptional resonance
cancellation (5.19) for (5.20) actually there is only one resonance present and we can
continue the construction procedure by solving the higher order equations. Without
such a cancellation we would have to introduce additional parameters, for example by
modifying the linear order approximation (5.6) (which is the case for the model with
cavity discussed in Section 5.4.1, with some variants present also in other considered
models) in some nontrivial way. The exceptional cancellation greatly simpliÔ¨Åes the
whole construction procedure and moreover it actually makes the even  case partic-
ularly simple to be carried up to a very high order of , which we discuss in detail
below.

The algorithmic approach for even number of space dimensions
Due to the boundary expansion of the solutions of the system (3.8)-(3.12), as was dis-
cussed in Section 3.1.3, the even  case admits a special form of the solution, since the

algorithmizationofbuildingupthesuccessivetermsin(5.1)-(5.3). Thegaugecondition
(, 0) = 0 is Ô¨Åxed by the form of expansion in (5.23).
For any even  ‡£ô 2 we solve the constraint equations (3.9) and (3.10) in the follow-

In this way the dominant mode () is present only at the linear order approximation
(5.1). It turns out that at each perturbative order all ƒÆ, tune in phase to the dominant
mode, i.e. the following holds
(5.32)
so the choice (5.31) reduces by the factor of two the number of integration constants by
setting all of ƒØ, in (5.29) to zero.

 ƒÆ,=0
 in (5.28) contains the resonant terms cos( ‡¢ß) (there are
, because we have set all ƒØ, to zero
already) this gives rise to secular terms  sin( ‡¢ß) in ƒÆ,(). Such terms would
spoil the periodicity and lead to the unbounded solution; thus, they have to be removed.
This Ô¨Åxes the correction to the frequency ,‚àí1, and the integration constants , in
(5.29). Namely, it turns out that in order not to produce spurious resonant terms in
higher perturbative orders, all but odd (in ) frequencies in the solutions for ƒÆ, have
to be removed. Therefore the coeÔ¨Écients in front of cos(2 ),  ‡¢† N, and cos(‡¢ß )
with ,  ‡¢† N, ( mod ) ‡£î 0, have to be set to zero. These conditions Ô¨Åx uniquely most
of the integration constants , in (5.29).
The number of the essential integration constants in (5.29) remaining after removal
of all spurious resonances is easy to determine. Since at any order  ‡£ô 3 the source
function  in (5.10) is a linear combination of Ô¨Ånite number of eigenmodes which
 ‡£ï 0,
means that we have
(5.33)
with ‡¢© = ( ‚àí 1)( + 1)‡¢ß2 + , the number of possible resonances is also Ô¨Ånite. The
resonant frequencies are those which are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency
, i.e. frequencies
(5.34)
where  is determined from the condition for the largest possible frequency present in

(5.35)
(Ô¨Ånite number of eigenmodes implies a Ô¨Ånite number of frequencies present in ).
Therefore the expected number of resonances is  + 1 with (from the condition (5.35))
(5.36)
Actually the number of integration constants is  since always for the  = 0 case in
(5.34) the corresponding integration constant is Ô¨Åxed by the normalization condition, in
our case by the requirement (5.5). At the same time there is an exceptional cancellation
present in  at any  (as pointed out in Section 5.1.1) and thus the number of available

5.1.2 Numerical evolution scheme
The evolution code presented in this section can be also used for the complex Ô¨Åeld
case, therefore to retain generality throughout this section we keep the absolute values
of complex quantities where they are necessary, and we treat the scalar Ô¨Åeld and its
momenta as complex valued functions.
The substantial parts of methods presented here are used not only to solve the
Cauchy problem but also for Ô¨Ånding the time-periodic and standing wave solutions to
the system (3.8)-(3.11) with real and complex scalar Ô¨Åeld respectively.
For the clarity of presentation we discuss Ô¨Årst the method relying on the use of
eigenbasis functions (3.31), since it is simpler than the second method which is based
on the Chebyshev polynomials. The drawback of using the eigenfunctions is that this
approach is applicable only in even number of space dimensions. This is due to the
incompatibility of boundary expansion as we stressed in Section 3.1.3. Only for even
 the boundary expansion of eigenfunctions and dynamical Ô¨Åelds are compatible and
only then the use of such expansion is justiÔ¨Åed. For this reason we also develop a
pseudospectral method, which is not limited in use by the boundary behaviour of the
approximated functions.
We use the MOL approach with the pseudospectral discretization in space to solve
the initial-value problem of the system (3.8)-(3.10) by using constrained evolution
scheme, i.e. we do not use explicitly the momentum constraint equation (3.11) to ad-
vance metric function . Therefore, the substantial part of the description of our meth-
ods is devoted to the discussion of how to solve the constraint equations eÔ¨Äectively.

where we have eliminated spatial derivatives of the metric functions  and  by using

This scheme diÔ¨Äers slightly from the one presented in [112] by the choice of collo-
cation points and the form of expansion in (5.59). The Ô¨Årst modiÔ¨Åcation is motivated
by the universality of our method. Previously used collocation points where simple
to obtain (given by an analytic formula) and good enough for only moderate values of
space dimension  (note the explicit dependence of basis functions (3.31) on this pa-
rameter), while for large  the matrices which appear in this pseudospectral approach
are ill-conditioned since have a large spectral condition number ([54], see also [129,
p. 431]). The desire to increase of numerical stability and accuracy for large  induced
us to use the formula (5.55) (which does not aÔ¨Äect the small  cases, it slightly low-
ers the condition number though). The second change, the expansion of the integrand
(5.59), is very convenient here, since then the weights (5.62) are easy to get (using the
integral relation for the Jacobi functions, see Section A.1 in Appendix), as opposed to
the cosines used in [112], where the integrals have to be computed for each  separately
and in fact are rather hard to get. Together, these modiÔ¨Åcations lead to a more universal
(in terms of ) and more stable numerical scheme.
The time integration of the system (5.56)-(5.57) together with the above method for
solvingtheconstraints(5.58)-(5.62)iscarriedbyuseoftheimplicitGauss-Runge-Kutta
method. The choice between explicit and implicit RK time integration method is dic-
tatedbytheintendedapplicationofpresentedpseudospectraldiscretizationmethod. For
the long time-evolution of initial conditions which do not develop singularities (whence
such for which we do not expect black hole formation) moderate number of eigenmodes
in (5.54) is needed to ensure precise approximation in such cases. Therefore, the cost
of solving implicit equations for the internal stages of RK process is moderate com-
pared to the overall cost of determining the RHS of dynamical equations (5.56) and
(5.57). Moreover, this cost is compensated by the properties of the symplectic Guass-
Legendre-RK methods as stressed in the Appendix C.3. The conservation of integrals
of motions (conserved mass and charge in the case of the complex scalar Ô¨Åeld) makes
these integrators especially applicable for the problems being considered.
The total conserved mass, given by the integral (3.16), can be expressed¬∂ as the
Parseval sum, i.e.

The quantity  can be interpreted as the energy of the mode (). The projections
(5.65) can be easily computed numerically since the matrices which need to be inverted
are constant and can be factorized in advance (using LU algorithm). For the complex
scalar Ô¨Åeld case the conserved charge deÔ¨Åned in (3.21) can be calculated in the follow-
ing way. Noting that the integrand (the  ‡¢© term) has the same structure of Taylor
expansion at  = ‡¢ß2 as the eigenbasis functions in the case of even , it can be written
as

Polynomial expansion
Due to incompatibility of eigenbasis functions with regularity conditions at  = ‡¢ß2
for odd , as stressed in Section 3.1.3, the method of the previous section is not ap-
plicable. In principle, it can be applied to the odd  cases but then it results in slow
(only polynomial) convergence and thus is highly ineÔ¨Écient. Therefore we use a poly-
nomial pseudospectral method where instead of the eigenfunctions we take Chebyshev
polynomials rescaled to the interval [‚àí‡¢ß2, ‡¢ß2] as basis functions for the expansion
of the scalar Ô¨Åeld (we are using double covering method which is described in detail in
the Appendix B). The property of having no speciÔ¨Åed symmetry at the boundary makes
Chebyshevpolynomialsspeciallyusefulforproblemswithgenericboundaryconditions
[34]. Therefore, the proposed discretization method in space for the system (3.8)-(3.10)
is applicable for both even and odd number of space dimensions.
The straightforward replacement of expansion functions in the method of previous
section, although possible and at the Ô¨Årst sight obvious step, leads to an unstable nu-
merical scheme. The Ô¨Årst problem we encounter is solving the Hamiltonian constraint.
Using the analogues of (5.59), (5.61) and (5.62) with () replaced by even or odd
Chebyshev polynomials  (2‡¢ß ) (taking care of the symmetry of the integrand in
(5.59)) generates spurious oscillations near the origin, especially for large values of 
( > 4); even if it does not give easily seen eÔ¨Äects for smaller values of  this does
not mean that there are no serious problems with this approach. Therefore we use the

formula (3.18) and writesin‚àí2 

(5.69)
Then, introducing the following combination of metric functions (noted previously to
be useful in Section 4.1.1)
(5.70)
instead of the function  itself, we rewrite (5.69) as equivalent of Hamiltonian con-
straint (3.10)
(5.71)
The use of metric variable  not only reduce complexity of the overall algorithm, since
this is the only way the metric functions enter the evolution equations (3.8), it also
removes the numerical instability otherwise occurring near the origin.

The second and more serious problem concerns the instability appearing near the
outer boundary ( = ‡¢ß2) which is especially manifest for large values of  and which
gets greatly ampliÔ¨Åed with the increasing number of grid points (an eÔ¨Äect indicating
a numerical instability). This can be understood by looking at the equations we are
solving and knowing the properties of methods we are using. Due to the regularity
conditions the scalar Ô¨Åeld falls as  goes to ‡¢ß2 more rapidly with increasing , with
thefalloÔ¨Ärategivenin(3.26)and(3.27). Thentheappearingdivisionsofsmallnumbers
when  ‡¢ê ‡¢ß2 and the clustering of Chebyshev grid points near the boundary is the
reasonforobservedspuriousoscillationswithrapidlygrowingamplitude. Toovercome
this we rescale dependent variables‚Äîboth of the scalar Ô¨Åelds  and ‚Äîby taking into
account their fall oÔ¨Ä behaviour near  = ‡¢ß2 (as in [36]) and we deÔ¨Åne

tions for new Ô¨Åelds
(5.77)
The rescaling (5.72) does not aÔ¨Äect regularity conditions at the origin (3.24), i.e.  and
' are odd and even functions at  = 0 respectively. This redeÔ¨Ånition of the dynamical
Ô¨Åelds is crucial for stable numerical scheme with Chebyshev pseudospectral discretiza-
tion, and together with use of (5.71) as Hamiltonian constraint equation leads to a stable
(for long evolution times) numerical scheme.
In the case of local methods, such as FDA, the numerical instabilities discussed
above can be eliminated without using the rescaling (5.72). Instead, the l‚ÄôHopital rule
is used on a portion of computational grid where the equations are most singular. This
approach was used in the previous works [28, 98] and it is described in detail in [113].
For the global interpolation methods, the overhead of computing the additional quanti-
ties is large compared to local approach, therefore such rescaling is preferred.
We discretize equations (5.73)-(5.75) and (5.71) using Chebyshev pseudospectral
method in spherical symmetry together with the barycentric interpolation formula (as
is described in Appendix B; using the notation for the Chebyshev weights  and diÔ¨Äer-
entiation matrices (,¬±)) as follows. The constraint equations are given as a solution
to the algebraic systems, which are derived similarly as for the cavity model derived in
Section 4.1.1. Using  +1 radial Chebyshev points (B.13) scaled to the range of global

and the integrals of Chebyshev polynomials are given in Appendix A.1. It should be
noted that the integrand (5.86) has a Ô¨Åxed parity near the center depending on  (it is
even function of  variable if  is odd, while it is even when  is odd). For that reason
the expansion in (5.87) is carried in terms of even or odd Chebyshev polynomials only,
depending on the space dimension .
Similarly we calculate the conserved charge for the complex case. Since in the
deÔ¨Ånition there is the  function present and not its spatial derivative , which is the
evaluated quantity, it introduces minor complication here. From the deÔ¨Ånition (5.72)
we can obtain Chebyshev expansion of the  Ô¨Åeld

which then we integrate in radial direction using relations (A.22)-(A.24) and get

where the integration constant is set to match the boundary condition (, ‡¢ß2) = 0.

5.1.3 Numerical construction
Numerical construction of time-periodic solutions relies heavily on the time evolution
code mainly because both use the same spatial discretization method. For the same
reasons as Section 5.1.2, here we also apply two approaches to the spatial discretization
oftheÔ¨Åeldequations,dependingonaparityofspacedimension . Beforegivingdetails
of numerical algorithms we Ô¨Årst discuss their common aspects.
Seeking for time-periodic solutions numerically it is convenient to use the rescaled
time coordinate  =   where, as in the perturbative construction,  denotes the fre-
quency of the solution we are looking for. In this way the numerical grid in temporal

104

5.1. Einstein-Klein-Gordon system‚Äîtime-periodic solutions

direction has Ô¨Åxed size and we are looking for 2-periodic functions. We construct
numerically an algebraic system for the expansion coeÔ¨Écients (or equivalently for their
values at numerical grid, depending on applied method) of the dynamical Ô¨Åelds. As
an output we get the time-periodic conÔ¨Åguration of these variables. The corresponding
metric functions  and  (the space-time geometry) can be determined, at each instant
of time, by solving the constraint equations for the time-periodic sources.
The resulting system of algebraic equations is solved with the Newton-Raphson
algorithm. To initialize this iterative procedure we take the data corresponding to a
single mode conÔ¨Åguration of dynamical Ô¨Åelds (as a Ô¨Årst order approximation to the
time-periodic solution), i.e.

 ‡¢† N0,

(, ) √ü cos  (),  = ,

(5.92)
while looking for solution bifurcating from the eigenmode (). These provide a good
guess for small and moderate amplitudes only. For larger absolute values of , in the
nonlinear regime, the convergence may be restricted and very slow when we start New-
ton‚Äôs iteration far from the true solution. So, instead of taking a single mode approxi-
mation (5.92) we use the local polynomial extrapolation of previously derived solutions
of smaller amplitudes. This slightly speeds up the convergence of Newton‚Äôs algorithm,
and makes possible to Ô¨Ånd large amplitude time-periodic solutions.
The proportionality constant in (5.92) is Ô¨Åxed by a particular normalization condi-
tion. As in [112] we can deÔ¨Åne a parameter  to be an amplitude of dominant mode

  =0

= ,

(5.93)

as we set in perturbative approach, cf. Eq. (5.5). The phase of time-periodic solution
is already Ô¨Åxed by (5.92). This choice is particularly straightforward to implement in
the numerical code and also easy to force in perturbative calculation but it may not be
the best choice in determining large amplitude solution (as we will see below). Another
equally simple parametrization of the solutions we get by controlling a central value of
the scalar Ô¨Åeld at some instant of time, set for convenience to  = 0, i.e.

(0, 0) = .

(5.94)
This being easy to set in the code using the eigenbasis expansion is not convenient for
rescaled variables (5.72) since there we operate on a gradient of  which for smooth
solutionsvanishesat  = 0. Thusinordertohaveanuniversalparametrization(suitable
for both numerical approaches) alternatively we choose to control the magnitude of the
 Ô¨Åeld, or ' respectively (since '(, 0) = (, 0)), at  = ‡¢ß2

(‡¢ß2, 0) = ,

(5.95)

while leaving the same phase of solutions, i.e. setting (0, ) = 0, in both cases.
Since these parametrizations may vary among the formulae and Ô¨Ågures presented
in this work, in order to avoid a confusion we stress explicitly to which parametrization
particular results are referring to.

Eigenbasis expansion
We expand both dynamical Ô¨Åelds  and  into eigenmodes of the linearized problem
in space and Fourier modes in time as follows

(5.97)
Then to solve necessary equations by means of pseudospectral method we choose a
compatible grid points, i.e.  collocation points in time  = ( ‚àí 1‡¢ß2)‡¢ß(2 + 1),
 = 1, ‚Ä¶ ,  and  collocation points in space (5.55). Next, at each instant of time 

space dimensions share similar features. For completeness we comment on other  and
 cases when necessary.
Using the perturbative approach we have derived approximation to the solutions
with diÔ¨Äerent  and  of high orders (in even ). Because of length and complexity of
generated formulae we restrict their presentation and give fourth order accurate results
only. The most compact expressions among the odd  are these for  = 3 and  = 0

our numerical procedure is able to converge for arbitrarily large values of  (of course

stabilityanalysisofthesesolutions, separatingstableandunstableconÔ¨Ågurations. Also,
discussed here, time-periodic solutions share similar properties, namely solutions with
amplitudes  < ‡¢© are stable while such with amplitudes  > ‡¢© are not (we look
into their stability by a direct time evolution, and give more details on that later in this
section). We also note that ‡¢© and ‡¢© are both decreasing functions of  and  (with
an exception in  = 2 where ‡¢© increases with  and ‡¢© > 1).
Even though the dominant mode amplitude retains its maximal value this does not
imply that time-periodic solutions of even larger values of scalar Ô¨Åeld at the origin

dominant mode). Although with (0, 0) increasing, other modes also increase their
amplitudes and dominant mode amplitude decreases that mode still dominates over re-
maining Fourier components. Therefore all of the solutions on a given curve shown
on Fig. 5.5 are bifurcating from single (liner) mode. Also, because the critical points
of the mass function are located to the right of the extremum points of dominant mode
amplitudes, all of the solutions derived in [112] are stable (see discussion above).
On Fig. 5.7 we plot proÔ¨Åles of time-periodic solutions bifurcating from the fun-
damental mode in  = 4 with increasing amplitudes  = (0, 0) = 0.6, 0.9 and 1.2.
These change smoothly with  from an almost harmonic oscillation dominated by 0()
mode to a v-shape and square like oscillation for  and  Ô¨Åelds in the nonlinear regime.
Qualitatively similar proÔ¨Åles we get when looking at diÔ¨Äerent space dimensions  ‡£ô 2
with tendency for the solutions to become more and more compact near the origin as 
increases (which is a typical feature of higher dimensional gravity).
Whileforodd  theexpansionofdynamicalvariablesintermsofeigenmodesmakes

stated before (here ‡¢© increases with ). Again, this is an eÔ¨Äect of parametrization be-
ing used, when expressed in terms of the same parameter, e.g. with ‚àí1 (‡¢ß2, 0), the
bifurcation diagrams do not diÔ¨Äer qualitatively among the even and odd .
Consistency of perturbative and numerical results
With two independent methods, aimed to construct time-periodic solutions, we have
performed series of comparisons to verify our results,ƒä beside the convergence tests of
the numerical approach, shown above.
Usingthe perturbativemethod, forsmall valuesof , independentlyof itsdeÔ¨Ånition,
we get fast convergence to the numerical solution. In [112] we compared the numerical
and perturbative results by looking at the frequency of time-periodic solutions bifurcat-

(where  =  0 =0). The results are in excellent agreement, especially when

we reÔ¨Åne both the numerical data, by using extended precision arithmetics, and the
perturbative series, by performing Pad√© resumation [15]. While a direct summation of
(5.133) gives satisfactory approximation for small values of , a Pad√© approximation of
 greatly improves convergence, see Fig. 5.9. Moreover, Pad√© approximation can be
used to estimate the radius of convergence of the series (5.133) or equivalently maximal
allowed value of dominant eigenmode amplitude. The zeros of the denominators of
[‡¢ß] nearest to the origin are: 0.128 251, 0.101 469, 0.094 708 and 0.091 904 for  =
2, 4, 6 and 8 respectively. These values converge to the limiting value of the dominant
eigenmode 0() amplitude 0.087 342, above which no time-periodic solutions exist,
this is also illustrated on Fig. 5.9.
Because of diÔ¨Éculties that Mathematica encounters in manipulating complex ex-
pressions, appearing in odd , perturbative expansions in odd  are of lower order
than those for even . Therefore, instead of so detailed comparison as above we have

checked that the frequency  of numerically constructed solutions has the same form,
as a function of , as given by the perturbative expansion. Since we are using diÔ¨Äer-
ent parametrizations in numerical code and in perturbative calculations, the expansion
(5.120) cannot be compared directly but has to be transformed accordingly. The fre-
quency expansion (5.120) expressed in terms of  = (‡¢ß2, 0) reads

Then the expansion coeÔ¨Écients, like these in (5.134), can be directly compared with a
least-square Ô¨Åt of even polynomial to a series of numerically derived solutions. In that
way we have compared the frequencies of the ground state  = 0 and Ô¨Årst excited state
 = 1 in  = 3, 5; the results, which are presented in Tab. 5.1 and 5.2, show an excellent
agreement of perturbative approach and numerical scheme with spatial discretization
based Chebyshev pseudospectral method. Furthermore we observe the expected con-
vergence, i.e. the diÔ¨Äerence of the two decreases when reÔ¨Åning discretization (which
extends beyond machine precision).
Lastly, we have veriÔ¨Åed that for even  cases, where both of presented numerical
approaches (the eigenbasis and Chebyshev spatial expansion) are applicable these pro-
duce consistent results (within discretization errors).

Stability of time-periodic solutions
To study the stability of constructed time-periodic solutions we read oÔ¨Ä the coeÔ¨Écients
of the expansion, either (5.96) and (5.97) or (5.108) and (5.109), depending on the
method we use, at the time  = 0 and put them as the initial data into spectral evolution
code. For small amplitude solutions, those with  < ‡¢©, time evolution is periodic in
time despite of the presence of truncation errorsand some amount of numerical noise in
preparedinitialdata. ThisisdepictedbyclosedloopsinFigs.5.10and5.11representing

note that after several reÔ¨Çections initial perturbation starts to grow, the energy begins to
Ô¨Çow rapidly from high to low modes (for  = 8 this starts at  ‡£à 75) which causes the
mass to leak out of the system (due to the fact that we are evolving in time Ô¨Åxed number
of modes, which are suÔ¨Écient to represent large amplitude solutions only at a very
early phase of the evolution) but this is not triggered for smaller initial perturbations,
see Fig. 5.12. Actually what we observe here is analogous to what we have seen in
the spherical cavity model with Neumann boundary condition (Section 4.1.3), and this
appear to be a common feature of the models we studied.
It turns out, as already mentioned at the beginning of this section, that not all of
the solutions on a bifurcation branch are stable. Evolution of initial conditions corre-
sponding to time-periodic solutions with  > ‡¢© shows that these are indeed unstable
with respect to small perturbations. The results of one of such evolutions in  = 4
is shown on Fig. 5.13. We have taken a solution with amplitude  = 1 bifurcating
from the fundamental mode  = 0 (‡¢© ‡£à 0.835 152). We plot the time evolution of 

perturbation) stays smooth for almost three times longer and also collapse.‚Ä†‚Ä† The later
solution, showing a delayed collapse, follows a slower oscillation interfering with its
natural frequency (7.5 <  < 9). This behaviour, which we do not understand so far, to-
gether with full linear stability analysis of constructed solutions clearly deserve further
extended studies.
Additionally, on Fig. 5.13 we show an absolute error in the conservation of the to-
tal mass to verify that the observed behaviour is not caused by the lack of resolution
and to point out the robustness of our numerical methods (the loss of conservation of
mass is caused by the fact that when the solution approaches collapse, a scalar Ô¨Åeld
proÔ¨Åle develops a steep gradient and the number of modes used in the truncation does
not suÔ¨Éce to represent the solution accurately). Moreover, on Figs. 5.14 and 5.15 we
compare evolutions of Gaussian perturbations (5.135) of AdS with explicit and implicit
(symplectic) time integrators. These, and also other tests we performed which are not
included here, indicate the superiority of Gauss-RK in long time energy conservation.

While time-periodic solutions to the left of the mass local maximum (Fig. 5.8) appear
to be stable (not shown here, we observe qualitatively similar to the results shown on

Since the () function has exactly  nodes we refer to the solution with dominant
mode  = 0 as a ground state solution while for solutions with  > 0 as excited states
(as in the boson star nomenclature). This particular choice of f1() in (5.140) together
with a requirement f(0) = 0 for  ‡£ô 3 Ô¨Åxes a value of scalar Ô¨Åeld at the origin to

with an additional equation Ô¨Åxing the central value of scalar Ô¨Åeld f (0) = . In this way
we get a nonlinear system of 3 + 1 equations for 3 + 1 unknowns the expansion
coeÔ¨Écients {ƒÆf, ƒÆA, ƒÆd}0‡£ò‡£ò‚àí1 and the frequency . Solving this system for a Ô¨Åxed
 with Newton-Raphson root-Ô¨Ånding algorithm yields the standing wave solution. To
Ô¨Ånd a standing wave solution with  nodes in f () proÔ¨Åle we start Newton‚Äôs method
with the following initial data

ƒÆf = 
(0)

,  = ,

(5.156)

and with all other Fourier coeÔ¨Écients in (5.153)-(5.155) set to zero.

Remark on alternative numerical methods
the
To construct standing wave solutions we could use an alternative approach, e.g.
shooting method or the FD discretization of Eqs. (5.153)-(5.155) (see [105] for appli-
cation of FDA to an analogous problem in asymptotically Ô¨Çat spacetime). The use of
such local methods is particularly advantageous when looking for solutions with large
central density. This is related to the character of the solution; when we increase  the
solution proÔ¨Åle f () gets steeper and steeper, while the metric function A() develops a
narrow local minimum. These features are hard to resolve with relatively small values
of . Additionally local methods do not suÔ¨Äer from the boundary behaviour issue thus
work equally well in odd and even dimensions.
Using a shooting approach we integrate Eqs. (5.153)-(5.155) outward starting at
 = 0 with the boundary conditions

(5.157)
which follow from regularity conditions. The condition for the eigenvalue  is the
regularity at the conformal boundary of AdS

d (0) = 0, A(0) = 0,

f ﬂ∞(0) = 0,

f (0) = ,

(5.158)
Alternatively, we can Ô¨Åx the value of  and shoot for  (it turns out that () is mono-
tonic function). For general value of  (with Ô¨Åxed value of  >  in  space dimen-
sions) the solution will not satisfy the condition (5.158). Only for speciÔ¨Åc values of 

f (‡¢ß2) = 0.

Chapter 5. Time-periodic and stationary solutions

131

this condition can be fulÔ¨Ålled. Moreover, being positive function at the origin with neg-
ative slope near the center f () may cross the real axis many times or may have no zero
at all. So, if we Ô¨Åx  >  then there will be an inÔ¨Ånite number of solutions regular
at  = ‡¢ß2 each with at least  nodes. In a very similar way one can solve numerically
equations governing linear perturbations which are discussed below.

5.2. Einstein-Klein-Gordon system‚Äîstanding waves
is a linear eigenvalue problem with√¥ as an eigenvalue. In principle, knowing standing
wave solution f (), A(), d (), we could integrate (5.163)-(5.165) to obtain a solution
in a closed form. Since this is not the case here, we again resort on perturbative method
(in principle we could solve the equations numerically, using either a pseudospectral or
shooting method, these can be solved simultaneously with the equations determining a
standing wave but from a perturbative approach we expect to gain more insight).
Relaying on perturbative approach we expand the unknown functions (), (),
¬±() and frequency √¥ in small parameter  (the same as in (5.140)-(5.143) for the

Plugging (5.140)-(5.143) and (5.168)-(5.171) into (5.163)-(5.165) we demand that the

This system is satisÔ¨Åed when: ‚àí,0 ‡£ï 0, +,0 = (), and 0 =  ¬±  or +,0 ‡£ï 0,
i.e. +,0() = (), ‚àí,0() = () with ,  such that  + 2 = ‚àí  holds, but
‚àí,0 = (), and 0 = ‚àí ¬± (there is also the case when neither of ¬±,0() is zero,
construction of solutions for this choice breaks down at higher orders, thus we exclude
this case). Taking into account the form of the ansatz (5.162), due to its symmetry:
¬± ‡¢ê ‡¢• and √¥ ‡¢ê ‚àí√¥, these two seemingly diÔ¨Äerent cases are in fact equivalent.
Therefore, it suÔ¨Éces to consider the former case, so as a solution of the linear system
(5.173) we take

 ‚àí (0 ‚àí )2 = 0,
2
 ‚àí (0 + )2 = 0.

Thus, at the lowest order in , solution (5.175) speciÔ¨Åes a standing wave with 
nodes perturbed by a single eigenmode with  nodes. Next, at each odd order  the
constraints are solved as follows. The coeÔ¨Écients ƒÆ, are simply given in terms of
the decomposition of the order  of the right hand side of the equation (5.163). Next,

5.2.4 Results
In analysis of the results obtained by the methods presented in previous sections, we
restrict ourselves to  = 4 case and present the fundamental ( = 0) standing wave
solution; properties of excited solutions ( > 0) are qualitatively very similar.
Fig. 5.17 shows both the convergence rate of our numerical pseudospectral method
and a comparison with a perturbatively constructed solution. A high order perturba-
tive series gives an accurate result which for small values of  ‡£† 0.2 is equivalent to
the numerical solution up to the roundoÔ¨Ä errors. On Fig. 5.18 we show a scalar Ô¨Åeld
and metric function proÔ¨Åles for few values of central density . With increasing value
of central density the scalar Ô¨Åeld proÔ¨Åle f () concentrates at the origin but still has a
polynomial tail. Also the metric functions A() and d () exhibit a steep gradient near
the origin. Since these compact conÔ¨Ågurations are diÔ¨Écult to accurately resolve numer-
ically with relatively small number of modes, the use of other than spectral methods are
preferred, as pointed out in the remark. The results shown on Fig. 5.18 where obtained
by shooting method.
Withincreasing thestandingwavesolutionbecomesmorecompactandmoremas-
sive (and at the same time more charged) while we note from Fig. 5.19 that there exists
a maximum mass for the family of solutions. Thus, in analogy to the asymptotically
Ô¨Çat solutions, this model also exhibits an analog of the Chandrasekhar mass limit. No
stationary conÔ¨Ågurations exists with masses greater than ‡¢© ‡£ï (‡¢©). Moreover, the
evolution of conÔ¨Ågurations that lie to the left of the mass maximum  < ‡¢© shows that
they are stable with respect to small perturbations while those to the right ( > ‡¢©) are
unstable. In asymptotically Ô¨Çat boson star models this type of behaviour was veriÔ¨Åed by
direct numerical evolution of unstable conÔ¨Ågurations [133, 8, 87], for self-interacting
case see [14]. The stability analysis of standing wave solutions is discussed in more
detail below.
The structure of solutions with diÔ¨Äerent number of nodes  in diÔ¨Äerent number
of space dimension  is as follows. For Ô¨Åxed space dimension  the location of Ô¨Årst
extremumof ()decreaseswithincreasing ; similarlyforÔ¨Åxed  (forgivenfamilyof

maximum value of mass of a ground state standing wave solution is ‡¢© ‡£à 0.138 065
and the Ô¨Årst few consecutive stationary points of mass are: ‡¢© ‡£à 0.563, 1.018, 1.377
and 1.682. Further, each such extremum point corresponds to the appearance of a zero
mode, i.e. √¥() tends to zero as  ‡¢ê ‡¢© (this issue is emphasized below). Moreover
each extremum point of () corresponds to the extremum of (), i.e. ﬂ∞(‡¢©) =
ﬂ∞(‡¢©) = 0. These properties of standing wave solutions in AdS are similar to the
boson star models in asymptotically Ô¨Çat case [77, 105, 106, 87].
To study the stability of small amplitude (0 < √¢ 1) standing wave solutions we
have solved the higher orders of perturbative equations (in terms of the  expansion) to
get successive approximation to the solution of the system (5.163)-(5.165) and in par-
ticular for the eigenfrequences √¥¬±
 (). Repeating this procedure for successive values
of  (the wave number) we can compute the spectrum of linear perturbations around
the standing wave (by deducing a general expression for frequency corrections  in
perturbative series expansion (5.168)). A systematic analysis of our results lead us to

(with  = 1‡¢ß16), evolution is diÔ¨Äerent (see Fig. 5.22 for a perturbed ground state solu-

large amplitudes of the Gaussian perturbation, after several dozens of reÔ¨Çections, the

does not show any sign of instability staying close to the stationary state at all times.
Moreover, similarly to the cavity model with Neumann boundary condition discussed
in Section 4.1.3, the scalar Ô¨Åeld (, ) evaluated at the origin exhibits linear scaling
with  (so does, in the leading order, the squared modulus). Here to see this scaling we
subtract the constant contribution of the standing wave solution, namely the constant
factor (f (0))2. The energy spectra of a noncollapsing solution seems to equilibrate
around some stationary distribution, with a small Ô¨Çuctuation of energy between eigen-
modes (see Fig. 5.23). Moreover, in contrast to perturbations of the pure AdS space,
we do not observe any scaling with the coordinate time  in this case. This picture holds
for standing wave solutions on a stable branch, i.e. solutions with  < ‡¢© and for both
initial perturbations conserving total charge (e.g. such as given in (5.192)) and these
that modify charge of a standing wave solution.
This picture changes dramatically when we perturb an unstable standing wave solu-
tion, such with  > ‡¢©. Starting with the same initial conditions as in (5.192) with small
positive values of  the solution inevitably collapses to a black hole. For negative  the
apparent horizon does not form and solution stays regular all the future times but di-
vergesawayfromastationarystateinasensethatitexhibitslargeamplitudeoscillations
around stationary state (this is in contrast with what we observe for the unstable time-
periodic solutions which undergo prompt or delayed collapse independently on the sign
of initial perturbation). This is illustrated on Fig. 5.24 where the unstable solution with
central density  = 0.65 ( ‡£à 7.894 722) was perturbed with Gaussian proÔ¨Åle (5.192)
of small amplitude  = 10‚àí4. The solution undergoes high amplitude oscillations; a
very similar phenomena was observed for a long time evolution of unstable boson stars
for ' = 0 case [105]. A use of suÔ¨Écient number of eigenmodes in numerical evolu-
tion together with symplectic integration method guarantees the high accuracy which is
conÔ¨Årmed by the mass and charge conservation (see bottom panel of Fig. 5.24). In con-
trast to the asymptotically Ô¨Çat case, here the excess of mass and charge cannot leave the
system and no convergence to a stable solution is expected. Since the oscillations are of
large amplitude it makes it diÔ¨Écult to precisely identify an eÔ¨Äective background state.

In this section we deal with time-periodic solutions of the pure vacuum Einsteins
equations‚Äîthe system of equations introduced in Section 3.2. The construction and
the methods follow similar steps as for the EKG system. The diÔ¨Äerences among these
two systems of PDEs lead to crucial modiÔ¨Åcations of perturbative construction which
we emphasize here. We start with perturbative construction in Section 5.3.1. Then
we describe the spatial discretization method (Section 5.3.2) and Ô¨Ånally we show the
numerical construction of time-periodic solutions (Section 5.3.3). We verify our ap-
proaches in Section 5.3.4 where the properties of time-periodic solutions are also dis-
cussed.

5.3.1 Perturbative construction
We follow the steps of Section 5.1.1 when constructing time-periodic solutions to the
modelintroducedinSection3.2. Weassumethefollowingsmallamplitude expansion

This form of perturbative ansatz reduces for  ‡¢ê 0 to a single eigenmode () oscil-
lating with frequency ‚Äîthe solution of linearized Einstein‚Äôs equations (3.52). At the
linear level this is a time-periodic solution (refereed by other authors as oscillon), and
with perturbative construction of time-periodic solutions we retain periodicity of the
higher orders of functional series (5.193)-(5.195) term by term.
ThestrategyisaminormodiÔ¨ÅcationofmethodsgiveninSection5.1.1andrestricted
to the problem at hand. One of the diÔ¨Äerences is the form of perturbative expansion,
given in Eqs. (5.193)-(5.195), where both even and odd powers of  are present, which
is a direct consequenceof the dependence of Eqs. (3.38)-(3.41) onsign of the squashing
Ô¨Åeld . For completeness we present all the steps in this construction, and point out
the necessary modiÔ¨Åcations we have to make in adapting the techniques developed for
the scalar Ô¨Åeld model.
We plug the expansion (5.193)-(5.196) into the Ô¨Åeld equations (3.38)-(3.40), per-
form the expansion around  = 0 and require the resulting perturbative equations to be
satisÔ¨Åed at each perturbative order . To reduce the complexity of the solution proce-

dure we decompose each of the metric functions, at each order , as follow

wheretheupperlimitsofthesumsareÔ¨Åniteanddependontheparticularchoiceof  and
theorderofthe expansion. Thechoiceofthebasisfunctionsdecompositionisdictated
by the boundary conditions (3.46) and (3.47) and the simplicity. Such decomposition
also reduces the perturbative diÔ¨Äerential equations to algebraic systems for expansion
coeÔ¨Écients of  and  function and the PDE for  to a system of second order
ODEs.
The exponential nonlinearity and structure of the Ô¨Åeld equations causes that at each
perturbative order we need to solve three equations, as opposed to the scalar Ô¨Åeld case,
the constraints and the wave equation. Therefore at each order  ‡£ô 2 we solve Ô¨Årst
(3.39) and (3.40) for  and  respectively, then from Eq. (3.38) we derive . We do

Starting with  function we plug (5.195) and (5.199) into (3.39) and get the following

The right hand side of this equation is a Ô¨Ånite combination of the sin(2) terms, so us-
ing orthogonality property of the sin(2) functions we can read oÔ¨Ä directly the ƒÆ,()
coeÔ¨Écients, which completely determine the solution (, ). The gauge condition
(, 0) = 0 is already enforced by the form of decomposition (5.199). Next, inserting

eigenmode () to  and its velocity to zero at time  = 0 ( = 0)

(5.205)
(this freedom is related to the fact that we may pick one particular solution from the
whole family of time-periodic solutions build on a given eigenmode (), while the
second condition corresponds to a freedom we have to Ô¨Åx the phase of periodic solu-
tion). It turns out that the choice ƒØ, = 0 implies that all other modes tune in phase
with the dominant one, i.e. ƒØ, = 0 for all  ‡£ô 0 and  ‡£ô 2. Next, following the idea
given in Section 2.2.1 we use the freedom we have in specifying initial data ,‡£î (the

when  ‡¢ê √ù. Thus all of the resonances have to be removed by Ô¨Åxing the remaining
integration constants and the frequency corrections . However, it turns out that this
is possible at any order  only if one solve the system (5.203) in a proper way, starting
at the lowest nontrivial order  = 2. The source function in (5.202) has the following
property
(5.206)
for  = 0, 1, ‚Ä¶ , 2 + 2,


  
so in particular the projection  =2
 vanishes for  = ‡¢© = 2 + 3. But the

condition
(5.208)
so ‡¢© ‡¢†  (it is the lowest resonant mode with (), cf.
(2.11) for deÔ¨Ånition of

inhomogenous system (5.203) by adding the term
(5.209)
being itself a solution of homogeneous wave equation (5.203). The additional parame-
ter, namely the amplitude ƒØ2,2+3, will be used to remove one resonant term at higher
order (speciÔ¨Åcally at order  = 4). The inclusion of (5.209) at order  = 2 allow us to
continue our construction up to arbitrary high order without need to explicitly include
further homogeneous solutions to (5.203) at any higher order. Furthermore, the num-
ber of integration constants , together with the expansion parameter  is suÔ¨Écient

to remove all of the resonances (with an exception for  = 4 where we also need the
explicitly included parameter ƒØ2,2+3 at order  = 2), and all of these parameters are
Ô¨Åxed at higher order of perturbative calculation leading to a unique solution.
In fact, the projections of the source to the inhomogeneous wave equation (5.202)
onto () mode, appearing at any order of the perturbative procedure described
above, can be reduced to just a few inner products; the source functions  consists
mostly of the terms like: csc2  ()(), cos(2)(), sin(2)ﬂ∞
(), ()() and
sin2  (), where each term individually can be written as a Ô¨Ånite combination of the
eigenmodes. Thispropertydoesnotholdforthe csc2  cos(2)()termswhichcome
form the products like csc2   (where  +  = , ,  ‡£ô 1, at order ), since each of
them separately do not have Ô¨Ånite decomposition onto the eigenmodes (). For that
reason the straightforward procedure to decompose the source term by term does not
work here (as it does for a scalar Ô¨Åeld system in odd spacetime dimensions, as analyzed
in Section 5.1.1). To overcome this we proceed as follow. Multiplication of the source
 by the factor sin2  removes troublesome terms and allow us to write (to simplify
notation we drop subscript of  and write  instead here; this trick applies to any
 sin2  =‡¢£
 ‡£ô 2)
(5.210)
written as the Ô¨Ånite sum of eigenmodes  =‡¢£
(as a Ô¨Ånite sum) with known coeÔ¨Écients ƒØ. Since we know that the source can be
‡£ô0 ƒÆ() we can plug this expression
into the former one and use the orthogonality property of the () basis functions to

 ƒÆ = ƒØ,

a tri-diagonal form and is non-degenerate whence can be inverted to Ô¨Ånd the necessary
coeÔ¨Écients ƒÆ easily.
The number of terms in the source function in (5.201) and in (5.202) rapidly grows
with the order , because of the exponential nonlinearity of the Ô¨Åeld equations, so the
construction of solution to a given order is much more involved then for a scalar Ô¨Åeld
systemdiscussedinSection5.1.1(wherethewaveequationforthescalarÔ¨Åeldislinear).
Therefore, in practice, with the same computational resources available we can obtain
approximation to a time-periodic solution to (3.38)-(3.40) of lower order compared to
the scalar Ô¨Åeld case (at least for the current implementation). The reason of that is also
the lack of symmetry of the perturbative expansion (5.193)-(5.196) where all powers
of the  are present, whereby at each order the constraints and the dynamical equation
have to be solved.

Integrals
In contrast to the scalar Ô¨Åeld case here we decompose the metric functions in cosine
basis (5.198) and (5.199), therefore for convenience the source functions in the cor-
responding equations (5.200) and (5.201) are simply decomposed by expanding the
eigenbasis functions and all of appearing products at a given perturbative order in the
cosine series.‚Ä† This simpliÔ¨Åes the implementation of the algorithm but this step is both

and the remaining expansion coeÔ¨Écients in (5.236) and (5.237) we set to zero. This
provides a good guess for small values of  only, as is for the EKG system, for larger
absolute values of  amplitudes Newton‚Äôs algorithm converges slowly or ceases to con-
verge starting from such initial conditions. Thus, we apply the same method as for
the scalar matter model and use the local polynomial extrapolation from the data corre-
spondingtotime-periodicsolutionsofsmalleramplitudesusedtogenerateinitialvalues
for Newton‚Äôs iteration.
In fact, at the output of this procedure we get a Ô¨Ånite dimensional representation of
the (, ) and (, ) Ô¨Åelds only, given as truncated expansions (5.236) and (5.236),
the remaining metric functions (, ) and (, ) can be also determined, at any instant
of time, by solving the constraint equations (3.39) and (3.40), as described in previous
section, with time-periodic sources (, ) and (, ).
5.3.4 Results
The analysis of the outcomes of perturbative calculations shows that the time-periodic
solutions of the system (3.38)-(3.40) have the following regular structure. The pertur-
bative expansion of the metric function  is
max‡¢£

(, ) =

ƒÆ,()(),

(5.248)

where the upper limit of the sum is Ô¨Ånite (as was pointed out before) and depends on
both the dominant mode index  and the perturbative order , that is

cf. (5.207). Each coeÔ¨Écient ƒÆ,() is a Ô¨Ånite linear combination of cosines

The frequency expansion () contains both even and odd powers of . Due to the
exponential nonlinearity of the Ô¨Åeld equations and the complexity of perturbative equa-
tions, with the current version of the Mathematica script we were not able to construct
a very high order perturbative solutions.¬ß

¬ßThe time limitation is one thing but the memory consumption of a running program is enormous, even
for the least complicated case,  = 0, the memory usage exceeds 128GB RAM at order  = 11 (which is our
main limitation now). This is a strong motivation for further improvements of proposed algorithm.

The perturbative proÔ¨Åles of the metric functions for the  = 0 case at  = 0 are
shown on Fig. 5.25. Derived solutions share similar features as those of the scalar Ô¨Åeld
model. Higher order perturbative expansions slightly modify the proÔ¨Åle of dominant
mode. A self-consistency test, of the perturbative construction, includes computation
of the total conserved mass of the solution, either by using the integral (3.45) or by
using expansion (3.47). This gives, as expected, the time independent -series which

These limiting values can be estimated using perturbative series expansion with
Pad√© resumation. Since the frequency expansion contains the most terms we analyze
this series. Computing a diagonal [‡¢ß] Pad√© approximation we have found that for
even  it contains simple poles on the real line only. These being closest to zero can be
taken as the upper bound of the convergence radius of constructed perturbative series.

solution bifurcating from fundamental eigenmode (0 = 6); we get similar results for
solutions bifurcating from higher eigenmodes.
The limiting values of the parameter  are absent when we use an alternative def-
inition of , given in Eq. (5.241), see Fig. 5.28 where we plot frequency and mass of
large amplitude solutions as a function of ﬂ∞ﬂ∞(0, 0). As for the scalar Ô¨Åeld system (Sec-

the Pad√© approximation does not have the poles on the real axis and their structure

whether they close or not over one or more revolutions. Decreasing an error in the
time-integration (by decreasing time step size) we observe a solution to get closer to the
periodic orbit. Even for relatively large step sizes, when the time-integration introduces
signiÔ¨Åcant amount of numerical noise, the distance to the periodic orbit stays bounded

solution stays within a bounded distance from a periodic orbit. This is illustrated for
the  = 4 and  = 70 case on a series of parametric plots showing time evolution of
eigenbasis Fourier coeÔ¨Écients (5.223). While unperturbed trajectories (blue lines) stay
periodic (up to numerical errors which are under control‚Äîused numerical procedures
are consistent), the perturbed solution (gray lines) does not exhibit any recurrences and
stays in a bounded and Ô¨Ånite distance (over simulated times).

ﬂ∞ﬂ∞(, 0).) For considered amplitudes the evolutions stays smooth. An observed modest
growth of a Kretschmann scalar for  ‡£° 1700 in each of the runs, and connected with
that the increase of the mass conservation error, suggests an onset of instability, of the
unknown origin (whether this is a numerical artifact, which we have not excluded at the
time of writing, or just a long time modulation being a real eÔ¨Äect).ƒä Clearly, we observe
diÔ¨Äerent behaviour than for unstable solutions of the EKG system. Therefore, if these
solutions are unstable then their unstable modes have small Lyapunov exponents.

5.4 Spherical cavity model
In this section we present and analyze procedures used to construct time-periodic solu-
tions of the system (3.58)-(3.58). The numerical procedure (Section 5.4.2) is an adap-
tation of Chebyshev pseudospectral spatial discretization, the perturbative construction
(Section 5.4.1) shows a diÔ¨Äerent structure of the solutions (compared to AdS case). The
analysisofresults, presentedinSection5.4.3,isrestrictedtothesmallamplituderegime
only and concentrates on veriÔ¨Åcation and comparison of these two approaches.

ƒäOne possible explanation would be that, regardless of the size of the controlled perturbation, already
the initial data corresponding to the time-periodic solution contains enough and signiÔ¨Åcant error to trigger
such growth. In fact the  = 10 solution was hardly derived using ‚Äôonly‚Äô 48√ó80 grid points, which noticeably
is to small to accurately resolve its rough proÔ¨Åle.

the calculations much more involved and these have to be done case by case for each
 (half-full automatization is still possible). For that case we carry out only the neces-
sary calculations up to the third order to to demonstrate main idea. Despite the fact that
the perturbative equations (5.265)-(5.267) are independent of a particular choice of the
boundary condition, the construction procedure is very diÔ¨Äerent in each case, for that
reason it is considered separately.

In practice, since we do not have tools (as for the AdS case in even space dimensions)
to produce and manipulate eÔ¨Äectively the higher order equations, and in particular to
determine the conditions (5.275), we truncate the sum in (5.273) at some  = max.
To demonstrate that this is the proper way to solve this problem we show the steps for
max = 1. Approximating 1(, ) by taking

1(, ) = ƒÆ1,0 cos  sinc () + ƒÆ1,1 cos 3 sinc (3) ,

(5.278)
(which are linear in 2 and cubic in ƒÆ1,0) and get a nontrivial, real and unique solution
(5.279)
(which is given by a lengthy formula in terms of Si() function, so we do not present it
here). In addition to the 0() and 2() eigenmode resonances (which are removed by
imposing the condition (5.278)) there are higher source projections which cannot be set
to zero, since we do not have a suÔ¨Écient number of free parameters as was mentioned
earlier. But, as was seen already, the coeÔ¨Écients in (5.277) are rapidly decreasing with
theirmodeindex, sotruncatingtheseries(5.273)withmoderatenumberoftermswould
produce partial but suÔ¨Écient approximation to a time-periodic solution see Fig. 5.35
(accurate up to the 2 order term with an approximate 1 and back-reaction 2 and 2).

To sum up, taking more terms in the initial sum (5.273), one gets successively better
approximation to the Ô¨Årst order solution 1(, ) which is determined by the lack of
resonances at third order, at the same time removes more and more resonances (among
inÔ¨Ånite number of them) present in 3.
Therefore, cancellation of all of the resonances is possible only if 1(, ) is a very
special linear combination of an inÔ¨Ånite number of the eigenmodes,‚Ä† among which the
() mode has the highest absolute value of the amplitude relative to amplitudes of the
other eigenmodes and the frequency of time-periodic solution is ( = 0) = . For

Neumann boundary condition
For the Neumann boundary condition, the dispersive case (3.74), there is only one reso-

i.e. the equation
(5.281)
for eigenfrequencies (3.74) has only trivial solution  =  and  = 1 for any .‚Ä° There-
fore this single resonance can be removed be setting the value of a free parameter ‚àí1.
All of the integration constants are Ô¨Åxed by the boundary condition (, 1) = 0 and
the normalization condition (5.264). Moreover, since the form of the basis functions
(3.71) is independent on , the construction can be performed without specifying .
For time-periodic solution with frequency bifurcating from  as Ô¨Årst order approx-

case, i.e. (5.269), we follow the same steps as in the previous paragraph. Both of the
solutions 3,1(, ) and 3,3(, ), will contain two integration constants. An additional
parameter will be the frequency correction 2. These constants we Ô¨Åx in a following
way. The regularity conditions at the origin and the Neumann condition at the cavity
will uniquely determine the function 3,3(, ). Imposing the same conditions on the

continue this construction with the higher order approximation in , with the only (but

the Mathematica). The analysis and manipulation of these is cumbersome (they are not
as easy to analyze as in the AdS+1 case with  even), which makes it hard to give some

tion we are looking for. Instead of expanding the Fourier coeÔ¨Écients ƒÆ(), ƒÆ() in
Chebyshev basis (we do not expand them in the eigenbasis of the linear problem (3.70)
since these eigenfunctions do not have correct boundary expansion, see Section 3.3.3,
which would cause ineÔ¨Écient polynomial decay of the expansion coeÔ¨Écients in that
case) we use the nodal representation, i.e. we operate on the function values on the grid
points ƒÆ ‡£ï ƒÆ() and ƒÆ ‡£ï ƒÆ() as described in Section 4.1.1 and Section 5.1.2.
With  radial Chebyshev collocation points (B.13) in space, and  collocation
points in time  = ( ‚àí 1‡¢ß2)‡¢ß,  = 1, ‚Ä¶ , , at each instant of time  we calculate
values of the Ô¨Åelds (, ) and (, ) at grid points  and use them as an input
in our time evolution procedure, getting as the output their time derivatives. Equating
those to the time derivatives of (5.284) and (5.285) (remembering that  =  ) at the
set of  √ó Cartesian product grid points (, ), together with the additional equation
(5.286)
settingthecentervalueofthedominantmode  intheinitialdatato , wegetanonlinear
system of 2 √ó  √ó  + 1 equations for 2 √ó  √ó  + 1 unknowns:
ƒÆ,, ƒÆ, and .
This system is solved with the Newton-Raphson algorithm yielding the time-periodic
solution of the system (3.59)-(3.61) (the corresponding geometry of space-time given
by metric functions (, ) and (, ) can be determined, at each instant of time, by
solving the constraint equations (3.60) and (3.61) for the time-periodic data (5.284) and
(5.285) at each constant time slice).
As a starting point for the numerical root-Ô¨Ånding algorithm we choose the single
eigenmode approximation, fulÔ¨Ålling the condition (5.286), i.e. we set

tial conditions) for both boundary conditions, Dirichlet and Neumann, with only minor

5.4.3 Results
We restrict the presentation of results to a comparison of our perturbative construction
with the numerical approach for small amplitude solutions only. Further studies should
be devoted to large amplitude solutions and their stability properties (as for in AdS).
To verify results of our methods we look at the proÔ¨Åle of the scalar Ô¨Åeld at  = 0

space, it is convenient to do this in a Fourier space. Therefore we read oÔ¨Ä the initial
data for the (, ) Ô¨Åeld resulting from (5.284). Then we project this function onto
() modes (the necessary integrals were computed numerically using the Gauss-
the ﬂ∞

5.5 Yang-Mills on Einstein Universe
In this section we continue studies of the YM system, initiated in Section 4.2. After
discussing perturbative construction of time-periodic solutions (Section 5.5.1) we re-
view the numerical method (Section 5.5.2). Since the perturbative analysis, in contrary
to numerical procedure, diÔ¨Äers when we consider perturbations around diÔ¨Äerent static
solutions (in diÔ¨Äerent topological sectors) both construction and results analysis is con-
sideredseparately. InSection5.5.3wepresenttheresultsandverifythembycomparing
numerical and perturbative construction.

5.5.1 Perturbative construction
The perturbative construction of time-periodic solutions is less involved for the YM
model when compared to previously analyzed systems, since here we deal with a single
PDE. As in previous cases this construction is based on the Poincar√©-Lindstedt method,
therefore the initial steps we follow here are the same as taken in Section 4.2.2, where
the perturbative construction of single mode initial conditions where presented. We
parameter  (0 <  √¢ 1) for solution proÔ¨Åle  and corresponding frequency , as
introduce new time coordinate through (4.67) and assume series expansion in small
in (4.69) and (4.70) respectively. The Taylor series expansion in  of the Eq. (4.68)
with (4.69) and (4.70) substituted gives the perturbative second order linear PDEs for
(, ). The Ô¨Årst four of them are given explicitly in (4.71)-(4.74); the higher order
equations contain much more complicated source terms. As in proceeding sections
 refers to an index of dominant mode in the solution, and since we are looking for
bifurcating solutions we assume for the leading order solution

terms with rational frequencies in , which produce spurious secular terms appearing
at higher orders). As it turns out, at some orders of the perturbative calculation there
may not be enough free parameters available to remove all of the resonances. Then,
as for the model of Section 3.2, we modify the solution by adding the homogeneous
solution whose amplitude would serve as a missing parameter. Since the construction

The construction of time-periodic solutions in the vacuum topological sector, with  =

spectrum. As before, we need to ensure that at each perturbative order there will be
enough parameters availiable to remove all resonances. It turns out that for any  the

where  is the largest positive integer such that
 ‡£ò ‡¢©,

(5.296)
holds, so  is the largest resonant frequency present in . From this we get  =
 ‚àí 1. Thus, at order  ‡£ô 2 we will have  ‚àí 1 =  ‚àí 2 free integration constants ,
(since one of them is used to satisfy the normalization condition (5.292)). With these
and with frequency expansion parameter +1 we can remove at most  ‚àí 1 resonances
at order  + 2 (the resonances at order  + 1 are removed by using the integration
constants left at order  ‚àí 1 and parameters ). However, for  ‡£ô 2 there are exactly
 resonances present at order  + 2 (at order  = 2 there is only one resonance which
is removed by setting 1 ‡£ï 0). Therefore this scheme would break down already at the
fourth order where there are two resonances present and we have only one parameter
available, namely 3. Consequently, at each perturbative order  ‡£ô 2 me modify the
solutiontothewaveequationbyaddingthetermwiththefrequencybeingthe ( +1)-th
multiple of , i.e, the term

ƒØ,‡¢©+2,+1 cos (( + 1)) ‡¢©+2(),

(5.297)
which is itself a solution to the homogeneous equation with  = ‡¢© + 2 = ( + 1) ‚àí 1
in (4.77). Thus, an arbitrary amplitude of (5.297) serve as a remaining parameter to
remove all of the resonances appearing at order  + 2. Repeating this reasoning with 
replaced by +1 we see that in this way we get a unique solution, which be constructed
up to arbitrary high order.

Kink sector
As we pointed out already the solution to Eq. (4.77) will contain terms cos(‡¢ß)
√ù( + 1)2 ‚àí 3), with obvious exception for  = . Therefore we can choose the inte-

the constant , is Ô¨Åxed by the normalization condition). If we have left such terms at
order , they would generate secular terms in the solution at order  + 2, through spu-
rious resonances (this is the reason why the Poincar√©-Lindstedt method failed to give a
uniformly bounded solution for a single mode initial data, as was emphasized in Sec-
tion 4.2.2) and the condition for their absence would Ô¨Åx the parameters ,. This is
equivalent, but the former way of Ô¨Åxing integration constants is the optimal approach.
In this way we can proceed to higher order up to appearance of another proper reso-
nance. Even though the eigenfrequencies are irrational numbers (with an exception of
the fundamental mode) there is an inÔ¨Ånite number of resonances, but they are irregular
(as opposed to previous cases, where the eigenfrequencies are equidistant). In fact the
resonant set , deÔ¨Åned in (2.11), is of measure greater than one for any  ‡£ô 2, since
the equation for 

is a singleton, and this makes the  = 1 case special. As an example we give below an
explicit form of solution to (5.298) for  = 2

We see that the resonant frequencies are irregularly distributed, hence the construction
of time-periodic solutions is not so systematic and has to be carried case by case. Be-
sides that, the strategy of resonance removing is identical to the previous cases. If the
resonance to the eigenmode  ‡¢†  appears at order res then we move back to the
order res ‚àí 2 and modify the solution res‚àí2(, ) by adding to it the term
(5.300)
with  = ‡¢ß, whose amplitude will be used at remove this resonance at order
res. Since then, at any order  ‡£ô res + 1, there will be two resonances present (up to
the appearance of the next resonance for the eigenmode with next index from the set
). These will be removed by utilizing frequency expansion parameter ‚àí1 and free
integration constant for resonant mode  the ‚àí1,. In this way the whole procedure
can be continued indeÔ¨Ånitely with growing number of proper resonances and number
of availiable parameters to ensure absence of secular terms. In general the appearance
of a given proper resonance would be hard to predict, nevertheless the order at which
the Ô¨Årst nontrivial resonance occurs can be precisely predicted. It turns out that before
that happens the solution at orders 2 ‡£ò  ‡£ò res is composed of eigenmodes among
res =‡§Ñ‡¢ß‡§Ö since then the resonant mode () will be present in res(, ), and at
which the highest one has index . Whence the Ô¨Årst resonance will occur at order
the same time res(, ) would contain Fourier mode cos  (because res > ). The
Ô¨Årst resonant eigenmodes and their order of occurrence in perturbative calculation for
Ô¨Årst few dominant modes  are listed in Table. 5.8. It is evident that the Ô¨Årst proper
resonance appears at relatively high perturbative order, especially for  = 7 it would

the terms like (5.300) are necessary. However one cannot neglect the resonances, even
if they appear at relatively high perturbative order, since they modify the solution in
a signiÔ¨Åcant manner. The two lowest order cases, namely those with  = 2 and  =

and (5.307) respectively greatly reduces time that Mathematica spends on computation
of the expansions and thus allows us to derive a very high order approximation to the
time-periodic solutions.

5.5.2 Numerical construction
To Ô¨Ånd a time-periodic solutions of (3.94) we follow the steps given in Section 2.2.2 of
introductory chapter. In this case, where we have a single second order wave equation
to solve, the complexity of the overall algorithm greatly simpliÔ¨Åes, compared to the
case of Einstein‚Äôs equations, since the lack of constraints and in addition the number of
dynamical variables is reduced here by the factor of two since the velocity and the Ô¨Åeld
are no longer independent (see (4.52) and (4.53)).
As in the previous cases, we use the rescaled time coordinate  =  , with 
standing for the frequency of time-periodic solution. We assume the following trun-
cated double expansion in the trigonometric series and in the eigenbasis of the linear
operator (3.96) of the time-periodic solution

(5.313)

(, ) =

ƒÆ, cos () (),

(note that this already Ô¨Åxes the phase =0 = 0). The unknown  √ó  expansion
coeÔ¨Écients ƒÆ, are then determined, similarly to the previous cases, by constructing
suitable number of algebraic equations. These are taken to be the requirement for the
governing equation, namely (3.94), to be identically satisÔ¨Åed at the discrete grid points.
Thus, we take a cartesian product grid with  collocation points of time coordinate
 = ( ‚àí 1‡¢ß2)‡¢ß,  = 1, ‚Ä¶ ,  and  collocation points in radial direction  =
( ‚àí 1‡¢ß2)‡¢ß,  = 1, ‚Ä¶ , , exactly the same set used in the spatial discretization
procedure discussed in Section 4.2.1, suited to the expansion (5.313). Next, at each

To visualize results of perturbative construction we plot on Fig. 5.39 density maps
of successive terms of the  expansion, namely the (, ) functions. Clearly, when
both the index of dominant mode  and the order of perturbative expansion  increase
the solution oscillates on smaller scales, both in space and time. Note also that the
symmetry of solution with respect to the equator of the three sphere,  = ‡¢ß2, for
 = 1 is retained at any perturbative order, while for  = 4 only even order terms (right

Though continuous, this dependence on amplitude is not monotonic‚Äîfor any  there
exist diÔ¨Äerent solutions having the same period and energy.
We derived numerically solutions on a mesh of 24 √ó 48 points, which produces ac-
curate results for small values of , but gives only rough approximation to true solutions
for larger amplitudes. The Newton procedure used to Ô¨Ånd the time-periodic solutions
converges rapidly for small and moderate values of . For larger values its convergence
is degraded, while for still larger values the algorithm ceases to converge even when
we provide better initial conditions than a single mode approximation (5.316), e.g. by
usingextrapolationfromsolutionswithsmallervaluesof forwhichthealgorithmcon-
verged. The borderline of existence of time-periodic solutions, the limiting values of 
are computationally diÔ¨Écult to determine. The high amplitude time-periodic solutions
have spectra which fall oÔ¨Ä exponentially but with very small slope, hence to accurately
approximate a solution we would need very large number of eigenmodes present in
truncated series approximation (5.313). Even using Ô¨Åner grids and taking better initial
guess for the Newton root-Ô¨Ånding algorithm it would not be possible to greatly extend
the bifurcating curves shown on Fig. 5.40.
However, for any  there seems to be a Ô¨Ånite range of  for which time-periodic
solutions exist. Constructing solutions for a few lowest dominant modes we observe
with the bad deÔ¨Ånition of parametrization variable. Since the dominant mode amplitude    =0

left this issue for further studies, and continue discussion using the parametrization (5.292).

the results of numerical calculations for  = 1 and  = 4 respectively. For  odd the
solutions for positive and negative values of  are distinct, which is clearly visible on
Fig. 5.42, where we present the fundamental solutions. The initial proÔ¨Åles of time-
periodic solutions preserve the number of zeros of dominant modes, even when other
modes have signiÔ¨Åcant amplitudes (especially for large values of ). This is no longer
true for other times, during the evolution the number of zeros changes, in contrast to the
linear solutions. This characteristic change of shape in time of function proÔ¨Åle, visible
also on Fig. 5.43, alongside with frequency change, is the nonlinear eÔ¨Äect. It is worth
to mention that symmetries, given in Eqs. (5.319) and (5.324), which are apparent on
Figs. 5.42 and 5.43, are not forced in numerical code, for given  and initial guess for

taking into account the symmetry of all odd  solutions (5.332).

Ô¨Årst proper resonance appears res is very large). Then the eigenmode decomposition
at higher perturbative orders greately depends on , since the resonant frequencies do
not seem to have any regular structure (cf. 5.299). (The exception is the  = 1, which is
the fully nonresonant (contrary to fully resonant) case and the formulae (5.328)-(5.331)
holds for arbitrary high order .) However, the resonances for  > 1 do not aÔ¨Äect the
symmetry of the solution, so the following holds

( + , ; ‚àí) = (, ; ),

(,  ‚àí ; ‚àí) = ‚àí(, ; ),

(5.332)

for  ‡¢† [0, 2] and  ‡¢† [0, ], in analogy to (5.324).
As was mentioned already, there are two things which distinguish the time-periodic
solutions in the kink and vacuum topological sectors. The Ô¨Årst characteristic concerns
the frequency of time-periodic solutions. For the family of solutions bifurcating from
fundamental mode ( = 1) the frequency does not depend on . In other words, all
time-periodic solutions which as a dominant mode have the 1() eigenmode oscillate
with the same frequency () = 1 even if they are far from the linear regime. This in-
dependence on amplitude is shown on Fig. 5.44, where we show results from numerical
calculations, this is also conÔ¨Årmed by high order perturbative expansion.
The frequency of solutions based on higher modes depends on amplitude. As for
the vacuum topological sector this is not a monotonic function, which is illustrated on
Fig. 5.44. But most importantly, the numerical procedure is able to Ô¨Ånd the solutions
with frequencies both smaller and larger than the corresponding frequency of bifurca-
tion point. Also the range of existence is increasing with the index of dominant mode,
in contrast to the vacuum case, demonstrated on Fig. 5.40, where the range of existence
shrinks with increasing . This makes the kink topological sector diÔ¨Äerent from the
vacuum case.
ProÔ¨Åles of solutions for  = 1 and  = 2 are shown on Figs. 5.45 and 5.46 re-
spectively. Again, note that the symmetries (5.327) and (5.332) are respected by the
numerical code.

Another feature which distinguishes these two topological sectors is the resonant
structure. To deal with the proper resonances appearing in perturbative construction
we modify the solution by adding some extra terms, which are homogeneous solutions
to the governing equations, with amplitude which subsequently serves as a parameter to
cancel otherwise occurring secular terms. This was emphasized over current chapter.
While for  = 1 these resonances have regular structure, in the kink topological sector
 = cos  resonances are irregular. Additionally they appear at relatively high pertur-
bative orders. Therefore it is interesting to validate perturbatively constructed solutions
with numerical calculations.
The two lowest order and tractable cases are the  = 2 and  = 4, see Tab. 5.8. For
 = 2 the resonance for the eigenmode 26() appears at order  = 13 and we claim
that inclusion of the term (5.300) at order  = 11 removes the resonance, for  = 4 the
resonanceappearsatorder  = 15andthesolutionmodiÔ¨Åcationisdoneatorder  = 13.
Solving higher order perturbative equations we supported this procedure, since the Ô¨Årst
proper resonance can be successfully removed and the construction can be continued

Further analysis of perturbative series and comparison with numerically obtained so-

approaches it is convenient to rearrange the perturbative series given in Eqs. (4.69) and

take  = 0. These results, with the resonant modes marked, are presented on Fig. 5.47.
This is in agreement with perturbative series given in Eq. (5.325) up to  = res ‚àí 1.
Moreover the analysis can be even more detailed. Performing the polynomial Ô¨Åt to the
resonant mode 26() coeÔ¨Écient ƒÆ26(0; ) (in  = 2 case) we can compare this with
the perturbative calculation. The straightforward approach would fail because of lim-
ited numerical precision. This is because for small amplitudes of dominant mode  the
amplitudes od resonant modes are hidden below the level set by double-Ô¨Çoating point
precision (which is of order 10‚àí16). In order to be above this threshold we need to take
 ‡£° 0.23 and  ‡£° 1.1 for  = 2 and  = 4 respectively. This if far beyond the linear
regime, where the nonlinearities are expected to dominate, and the perturbative approx-
imation does not work. The resolution to this remedy is to use the extended precision
arithmetic excellent facilities of Mathematica. Setting the arithmetic precision to 80
signiÔ¨Åcant digits we were able to determine solutions for very small  (with residuals
not exceeding 10‚àí80 in absolute value). The results of the Ô¨Åtting procedure and the
coeÔ¨Écients extracted from perturbative series are compared in Tab. 5.9. The agree-
ment for lower order coeÔ¨Écients of a polynomial Ô¨Åt is astonishing, while the higher

modes are moderately accurate. This would converge both with increasing the number
of eigenmodes taken in truncated series expansion (5.313) and with denser probing in 
(especially for relatively small amplitudes where the perturbative series converge). The
same quality of the result we obtain in the  = 4 case by performing the same analysis,
see Tab. 5.10.

5.6 Conclusions
In this chapter we presented the perturbative and numerical methods used to Ô¨Ånd time-
periodic solutions to speciÔ¨Åc mixed elliptic-hyperbolic systems of PDEs on bounded
domains especially to the Einstein equations with negative cosmological constant.
The construction follows a general scheme given in Chapter 2 but the structure of
considered equations enforces various modiÔ¨Åcations. This mainly concerns the pertur-
bative construction where certain additional resonant terms may appear when building
successive approximation, and their removal is nontrivial (apart from proper choice of
basis functions and the eÔ¨Écient solution to the perturbative equations). As a part of the
numerical construction of time-periodic solutions, which itself is rather universal, we
have described spatial discretization and in particular we demonstrated how to eÔ¨Äec-
tively solve the constraint equations. Finally, we have shown that our approach leads
to a stable and convergent numerical scheme. For time evolution problems we have
demonstrated superior properties (near preservation of constants of motion) of sym-
plectic time-integration algorithms in long-time simulations.
Extending the results of [112], we have shown the steps of perturbative construction
of time-periodic solutions to the EKG system in any space dimension  ‡£ô 2, especially
for the physically most interesting case  = 3. While for odd  the construction pro-
cedure (general approach) is challenging (it requires manipulation of long formulae of
a very complex structure) it can be greatly simpliÔ¨Åed in even  by using the eigenbasis
expansion (algorithmic approach). For even  we can reduce the problem of solving
coupled PDEs to algebraic equations and a system of second order ODEs. Thus the
equations are much easier to solve and the whole procedure is much more eÔ¨Écient.

appearing resonant terms, that at each perturbative order we are able to cancel all of the
resonances and that produced expressions give a unique solution up to the deÔ¨Ånition
of the expansion parameter. The diÔ¨Äerence between even and odd  also manifests
in the numerical construction. For studies of even dimensional cases we have used
improved numerical scheme of [112, 114] based on the eigenbasis expansion. For odd
dimensional cases, where the former code cannot be used, we employed Chebyshev
pseudospectral spatial discretization, which additionally is universal in terms of the
space dimension .
Using two independent approaches to the construction of time-periodic solutions
we veriÔ¨Åed our results directly comparing the perturbative and numerical data, per-
forming convergence tests, and Ô¨Ånally by the time evolution of the time-periodic solu-
tions (supporting their periodicity). We stressed the importance of appropriate choice
of the continuous parameter identifying solutions of a given family (solutions bifurcat-
ing from given linear mode). While this choice is not particularly important in the case
of small amplitude solutions, the use of proper parametrization is crucial in studies of

Chapter 5. Time-periodic and stationary solutions

195

large amplitude solutions (we noted this in all of the considered problems). Using a
center value of the scalar Ô¨Åeld as an expansion parameter we found that there are no
solutions with arbitrarily large mass‚Äîthe mass function attains its maximum for large
amplitude time-periodic solutions. The critical amplitude separates stable branch and
unstable branch of solutions. Time evolution of perturbed conÔ¨Ågurations on the stable
branch gives evidence on their nonlinear stability (solutions stays all the time in Ô¨Ånite
distance to the periodic orbit). In contrast, solutions on the unstable branch unstable
branch when perturbed collapse to a black hole almost immediately.
These techniques were applied also to a complex scalar Ô¨Åeld in the studies of stand-
ing waves (counterparts of time-periodic solutions). Simple form of standing wave so-
lutions(staticmetricandpurelyharmonicoscillationofmatterÔ¨Åeld)allowedustostudy
their linear stability problem. In particular, using analytical techniques we were able
to solve the eigenvalue problem, proving their linear stability. Using numerical meth-
ods we veriÔ¨Åed our analytical results, in particular consistency of the ansatz we used in
the perturbation analysis. Moreover, we determined explicit perturbative (in size of the
standing wave solution) expression for the frequency of the oscillatory modes. This lin-
ear spectrum turned out, not surprisingly, to be dispersive which explains the nonlinear
evolution of perturbed standing waves. These behave in a similar fashion to perturbed
(stable)time-periodicsolutionsandscalarperturbationsinsphericalperfectlyreÔ¨Çecting
cavity model with the Neumann boundary condition.
Next we examined, by means of the same methods, time-periodic solutions for vac-
uum Einstein‚Äôs equations using the cohomogenity-two biaxial Bianchi IX ansatz. Ex-
plicit exponential nonlinearity of the Ô¨Åeld equations, in terms of the squashing Ô¨Åeld
makes the perturbative construction rather involved. The perturbative expansion con-
tains both odd and even terms and all of the equations need to be solved at each per-
turbative order. Among that one additional resonance‚Äîunremovable by the straight-
forward approach‚Äîappears at the Ô¨Åfth perturbative order. This induces a modiÔ¨Åcation
of lower order solution by inclusion of a homogeneous term. After demonstrating the
convergence of the numerical method and the conformity of numerical and perturbative
results, we studied the stability problem of time-periodic solutions (here also the mass
of the solutions is bounded from above). We conÔ¨Årmed the stability of small amplitude
time-periodic solutions. However, large amplitude solutions, exhibits more complex
structure than less massive solutions, also behave diÔ¨Äerently than their scalar ‚Äôcoun-
terparts‚Äô. They do not collapse rapidly when perturbed slightly, and the Kretschmann
scalar monitored at the origin does not give any evidence for the instability during long
timeevolution,butduetonumericaldiÔ¨Éculties,stabilityofsuchconÔ¨Ågurationsremains
an open problem requiring further investigation.
In a similar manner we analyzed two remaining models, the perfectly reÔ¨Çecting
spherical cavity model and the YM system, aimed mainly to exploit various structures
of small amplitude time-periodic solutions. (The issue of reparametrization and de-
tailed stability analysis of constructed solutions are left for further studies.) The lin-
earized spectra of these models can have diÔ¨Äerent character‚Äîthis aÔ¨Äects the form of
the solutions (again, this concerns the perturbative expansion, the numerical approach
stays unaltered). The analytical construction relies heavily on the fact that resonances
appear and their successive removal Ô¨Åxes free parameters (either those in homogeneous
terms or the ones appearing as integration constants) in successive perturbative orders.
One may naively think that for dispersive linear spectrum resonances are absent and
therefore no time-periodic solutions exist then‚Äîwe show that this is not the case.
For the YM equation the resonant structure require homogeneous terms to be in-

196

cluded in solution at more than only one perturbative order (for the kink topological
sector with irregular structure of the resonant set) or even at each perturbative order
(for the vacuum topological sector with regular structure of the resonant set) during the
construction. Without such modiÔ¨Åcations the number of available parameters will be
insuÔ¨Écient to remove all of the appearing resonances and so the procedure will break.
(We have used this modiÔ¨Åcation already for time-periodic solutions of the vacuum Ein-
stein equations.) A notable exception is a family of solutions bifurcating from the fun-
damental mode in the kink topological sector (in this case the bifurcation frequency is
an integer, while higher mode frequencies are irrational numbers). For that case the res-
onant set is a singleton and so there is only one resonance present at each perturbative
order. Surprisingly, the oscillation frequency for this family of time-periodic solutions
does not depend on the amplitude. This is due to the fact that the structure of perturba-
tiveequations, inthatparticularcase, enforcesthefrequencycorrectionstovanish. This
special case and the presence, in other families of time-periodic solutions, of homoge-
neous terms (especially their amplitudes) are conÔ¨Årmed, with great accuracy, in the
numerically constructed solutions with extended precision arithmetics (in some cases
it was necessary to use higher than machine precision in order to verify perturbative
prediction).
In all of the above systems the Ô¨Årst order approximation to the time-periodic solu-
tionisasingleeigenmodeonly. ThisisalsothecaseforthecavitymodelwithNeumann
boundary condition. However, with Dirichlet boundary condition there are more reso-
nances present already at the third (Ô¨Årst nontrivial) perturbative order and a single free
parameter (the frequency correction) does not suÔ¨Éce to construct a bounded solution
with just one mode at the linear level. For that reason the Ô¨Årst order solution has to be
very speciÔ¨Åc superposition of eigenmodes such that all of the resonances are absent.
We veriÔ¨Åed this by truncating this inÔ¨Ånite series and comparing results (in principle
convergence with the truncation order) with the numerics.
To summarize, in this chapter we have presented details of construction of time-
periodic solutions to nonlinear systems of PDEs, in particular to the Einstein equations
with negative cosmological constant (in the 1 + 1 dimensional settings). For each of
the considered models we used two independent methods which give consistent re-
sults which demonstrated their correctness and give credence to the existence of time-
periodic solutions. Additionally, we analyzed constructed solutions and described their
properties(includinginfewcasesthestabilityanalysis). Theseleadustotheconclusion
that the existence of time-periodic solutions to the nonlinear nondissipative evolution
equations on bounded domains seems to be a rule rather than exception. In such class
of PDEs systems the time-periodic solutions are dynamical counterparts of the static
solutions, thus their derivation (we demonstrated that this is not very diÔ¨Écult) should
be the Ô¨Årst step in studies of nonlinear wave equations on bounded domains.

In this closing chapter we provide summary of the thesis and give several remarks on
future work in the Ô¨Åeld.

6.1 Summary
In this thesis we studied dynamics of nonlinear waves on bounded domains. Because of
ourprimarymotivation,(in)stabilityproblemofAdS,wehavedevotedmostspacetothe
analysis of equations describing perturbations of aAdS spaces. We have demonstrated
the existence of (strictly) time-periodic solutions within each of analyzed systems thus
showing that time-periodic solutions are common to the nondissipative nonlinear PDEs
on bounded domains. In particular, we constructed time-periodic solutions to the vac-
uum Einstein equations with negative cosmological constant under cohomogenity-two
biaxial Bianchi IX ansatz. Even though the analyzed systems diÔ¨Äer in details, time-
periodic solutions can be constructed by means of general procedures: the perturbative
Poincar√©-Lindstedt method and Newton‚Äôs root-Ô¨Ånding numerical algorithm based on
pseudospectral discretization, as described in Chapter 2.
We made extensive tests and detailed comparisons of our two independent con-
structions and direct numerical evolution of initial data corresponding to time-periodic
solution. All of them corroborate the correctness of our approaches. We analyzed the
properties constructed solutions, in particular we demonstrated their stability. For the
complex scalar Ô¨Åeld case of the EKG system we investigated in more detail the linear
stability of standing wave solutions. We showed the dispersive character of the spec-
trum of their linear perturbations from which we also infer the change of stability at the
turning point for any family of solutions.

dynamics is not an exclusive domain of aAdS spaces but can be also observed in con-

acter of the linear spectrum aÔ¨Äect the nonlinear dynamics, we analyzed by weakly non-
linear perturbative expansion small amplitude initial data and highly nonlinear regime
by means of numerical solution of initial or initial-boundary value problems. In all
considered cases with dispersive spectra we observed spreading of the initial perturba-
tion which for small amplitude was preventing solution to collapse (for self-gravitating
models). Moreover, weobservedstudyingtheYMsystem(inperturbativecalculations)

in both cases in the long time evolution the energy cascade eventually stops.
Above that we have developed numerical methods intended for long and stable time
evolution of Einstein equations with negative cosmological constant and related prob-
lems. These methods are based on MOL approach with pseudospectral discretization
in space and RK time integration. We veriÔ¨Åed their robustness and in particular we
demonstrated superiority of symplectic ODE integrators.
Althoughourresultsarenotrigorous(neitherweprovideproofofexistenceoftime-
periodicsolutionsnorweprovetheconvergenceofderivedperturbativeseries)wehope
that the presented evidence leave little doubt.

6.2 Future work
This thesis focuses on only a few particular aspects of a very interesting and broad area
lying on the interface of General Relativity and turbulence. There are many further
directions to pursue or questions to answer, let alone attempts to prove the existence of
time-periodic solutions we have constructed. Below we enumerate some of them:
i) Do all time-periodic solutions of the EKG model on the unstable branch collapse
to a black hole? (We have conÔ¨Årmed this only for several points on the unstable
branch.) Why do we not observe a similar behaviour (large amplitude oscillations)
as in the complex scalar Ô¨Åeld case?

ii) The results of stability studies of time-periodic solutions within the cohomogenity-
two biaxial Bianchi IX ansatz are not conclusive; it would be particularly valuable
to reÔ¨Åne these results.

iii) What is the long-time dynamics of perturbed unstable standing wave solutions?
iv) Concerning the problem of stability of the time-periodic solutions, it would be in-
teresting to see whether these solutions are stable with respect to perturbations out-
sidetheansatz, e.g. byconsideringgeneralizationsoftheYMÔ¨Åeldtothesphaleron
sector [130, 45], or by considering coupled Einstein-Yang-Mills system, or by re-
laxingthecohomogenity-twobiaxialBianchiIXansatztoincludetriaxialcase[24].
v) Full understanding of the nonlinear evolution of solutions to the YM equation is
certainly beyond the reach of our currently developed mathematical technology.
Therefore, it would be valuable to study the system (4.91) as a particular low di-
mensional approximation of the original equation.

vi) Recently, there has been considerable interest in studies of the EKG system with
a massive scalar Ô¨Åeld [90, 91]. In the context of AdS instability this seems to be
‚Äôthe next step‚Äô towards answering the question how the boundary conditions, im-
posed on the conformal boundary of the AdS space, aÔ¨Äect global dynamics. Under
particular conditions, for massive scalar Ô¨Åeld, there is a freedom to consider more
general boundary data [23], which require an extensive exploration.

vii) Exploring the perfectly reÔ¨Çecting spherical cavity model one can study more sys-
tematically the eÔ¨Äect of dispersive character of the linear spectrum on nonlinear
dynamics either by considering system with angular momentum [122] (which by
a centrifugal barrier term introduces the discrete parameter controlling dispersion
relation) or by going to higher dimensions (strikingly the  = 3 case is special in

Chapter 6. Summary and Outlook

201

a sense that with Dirichlet boundary condition the linear spectrum is equidistant
(nondispersive), which is not the case for  ‡£î 3 both for Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary conditions).
viii) Since the analysis of the Einstein equations is particularly involved (both analyti-
cally and numerically) its seems useful to analyze simpler models. The YM sys-
tem considered here turned out to not to be the best model of the AdS dynam-
ics (the energy transfer eventually stops, even though the spectrum is nondisper-
sive). Alternative toy model would be semi-linear wave equation derived from the
cohomogenity-two biaxial Bianchi IX ansatz by ‚Äôignoring‚Äô the metric functions 
and  (Section 3.2). The resulting PDE for the squashing Ô¨Åeld has a nondisper-
sive spectrum and the nonlinearity of geometric nature. Preliminary studies have
shown the existence of time-periodic solutions and a blow-up phenomena for rela-
tively small initial data.

ix) Finally, with methods presented in this thesis one can eÔ¨Äectively analyze (in par-
ticular perform the time evolution) cases when the turbulence is ‚Äônot active‚Äô. For
Ô¨Åeld conÔ¨Ågurations developing steep gradients, for which black hole formation or
blow-up is expected, current methods are fairly ineÔ¨Écient. Still more involved
techniques like moving mesh methods [38] may be required.

B.1 Chebyshev method
The Chebyshev polynomials (see Section A.2) are one of the most used class of orthog-
onal polynomials in spectral methods. They are not only distinguished by the analytic
form of the quadrature nodes and weights but also by their simple form and the connec-
tion with the Fourier series makes them particularly important in the context of spectral
methods.
We assume that () is a smooth function (deÔ¨Åned on interval  ‡¢† [‚àí1, 1]),
which is well approximated in the Ô¨Ånite ( + 1) dimensional subspace of  =
Chebyshev polynomials as basis functions of , any function can be approximated
as

The expansion coeÔ¨Écients ƒÆ can be eÔ¨Äectively computed using the trigonometric re-

these can be computed using either quadrature formulae or by solving the linear alge-

B.2 Spherical symmetry
EachoftheproblemsencounteredinthisthesissuÔ¨Äerforthesingularityofthespherical
coordinate system. In most cases we use the basis functions (the eigenbasis associated
with the linear operator) for the expansion of approximated functions. These functions
are regular at the origin and also convenient to use. But not always they are compatible
withtheboundaryexpansionattheouterboundaryforthenonlinearproblem. Therefore
other set of functions should be used and these typically are Chebyshev polynomials
[34].
The diÔ¨Éculty in using polynomial spectral methods in spherical coordinate systems
is twofold. First, the equations written in spherical coordinate system are typically sin-
gular at the origin (especially those containing Laplacian operator). Second, for poly-
nomial interpolation methods the grid points are clustering near the domain boundaries
which for the time-dependent problems severely restricts time steps taken (because of
stability restrictions). These issues can be easily resolved by noting that the singularity
of the Laplace operator written in spherical coordinates is just an apparent singularity.
The solution to a diÔ¨Äerential equation is usually smooth at the origin  = 0 and it should
be taken into account in numerical calculations. Additionally, more grid points in the
region where the approximated function is smooth is usually unnecessary.
While many resolutions for the spectral methods in spherical (and related) coordi-
nate systems have been proposed for various problems (see, e.g. [34, Chapter 18]) we
prefer to use the ‚Äôdouble covering‚Äô method [141]. We demonstrate this approach by ap-
proximating and computing derivatives of smooth function deÔ¨Åned on the unit radial
interval  ‡¢† [0, 1]. To weaken the coordinate singularity at the origin  = 0 we ex-
tend the radial coordinate to  ‡¢† [‚àí1, 1] (without rescaling) and use the (anti)symmetry
(withrespectto  = 0)ofapproximatedfunctionstoreduceactualcalculationstowithin
[0, 1]. We assume  ‡¢º [‚àí1, 1]  R be a smooth function such that
(B.11)
holds, with  = 0 or  = 1 for even or odd cases respectively. Then we take (2 + 1)

(Here we adapt a convention that the quantities deÔ¨Åned on a computational grid are
denoted by over tilde while these on the ‚Äôphysical‚Äô part of the grid are not.) In this way
we exclude the origin from our scheme, since  = cos(‡¢ß(2 + 1)) ‡¢ê 0 only

number of Ô¨Çoating-point operations (thus the computational complexity) by the factor
of two when computing the derivatives (the necessary matrices in (B.16) are calcu-
lated only once at the initialization phase). To simplify notation we adapt the following

Runge-Kutta methods

In this chapter we consider one-step methods for the systems of ODEs. In particular we
discuss the Runge-Kutta methods. Here we give only necessary deÔ¨Ånitions and state
key theorems characterizing the methods. We motivate the use of specialized methods
for the problems considered in this thesis.
For proofs and more details concerning methods for ODE systems we refer to spe-
cialized series of books [83, 84, 82] and references therein to research papers.

 ‡£ò  we have an explicit (ERK) method. If  = 0 for  <  and at least one  ‡£î 0,
we have an diagonal implicit Runge-Kutta method (DIRK). If in addition all diagonal
elements are identical ( =  for  = 1, ‚Ä¶ , ), we speak of a singly diagonal implicit
(SDIRK) method. In all other cases we speak of an implicit Runge-Kutta method (IRK).
The coeÔ¨Écients ,  and  of RK methods are commonly listed in a table (the

DeÔ¨Ånition 2. A Runge-Kutta method (C.2) has order  if for suÔ¨Éciently smooth prob-
lems (C.3), the Taylor series for the exact solution (0 + √í) and for 1 coincide up to

known from its balance between the cost and accuracy. Many higher order methods
where constructed over the years of research, but they are necessary much more com-
putationally costly, since the number of stages ( in formulas (C.1) and (C.2)) rapidly
increases with  (in fact for  ‡£ô 5 no ERK method exists of order  with  =  stages).
It is often advantageous to continue integration with dynamically changing step
size √í. This is either done by using Richardson extrapolation or by using RK formulae
which contain two numerical approximations for (0 +√í) where their diÔ¨Äerence yields
an estimate of the local error which is then used for step size control. The embedded
ERK methods are characterized by the Butcher tableau

The characteristic feature of the Dormand-Price methods [60] is that they have a min-
imal error coeÔ¨Écients of the higher order result ( = 5 here) which is then used as
numerical solution (as opposed to Fehlberg methods [62] which use the lower order
approximation as an initial value for the next step).
The part of the computations in this thesis using (C.10) where obtained by adapting
the DOPRI5 routine of the FORTRAN code  implementing the adaptive step method
(C.10).

Implicit methods

C.3
For implicit methods, the 1, ‚Ä¶ ,  in (C.2) are not given explicitly (as is for ERK).
The fully implicit method of  stages constitute of  √ó  equations to be solved at each
step (for ODE system of size ). This makes the IRK more complicated to implement
and simultaneously more expensive to use than the ERK methods. Nevertheless, the
propertieslikelargerdomainsofstabilitymakeIRKespeciallyusefulforstiÔ¨Äequations,
wherethepossibilitytomakelargerstepsizescompensatesthecostofsolvingnonlinear

quality is more important than accuracy, is discussed later.
One of the class of IRK are the collocation methods, and in particular Gauss meth-
ods(knownalsoasGauss-LegendreRKmethods),whicharecollocationmethodsbased
on the Gaussian quadrature formulae, i.e. the 1, ‚Ä¶ ,  in (C.20) are the zeros of the
shifted Legendre polynomial (see Section A.3) of degree 

Schemes of order  = 2 can be constructed for any  ‡£ô 1 (see [39] where also methods
of orders  = 8 and  = 10 are explicitly given). Their stability domains are precisely
the left half-plane (these methods are A-stable). However, our main interest of these
methods is due to their properties when applied to the Hamiltonian systems.

(C.15)
( ƒ≥ ‡£ï d‡¢ß d), where the Hamiltonian function (, ) = (1, ‚Ä¶ , , 1, ‚Ä¶ , ) is the
Ô¨Årst integral. Moreover, the Ô¨Çow corresponding to (C.15) is symplectic, it preserves the

DeÔ¨Ånition 3. A one-step method is called symplectic if for every smooth Hamiltonian

is symplectic, i.e. preserves the diÔ¨Äerential 2-form (C.16).

An important property of the Gauss methods is stated in the following theorem

Theorem 1 ([83, p. 315, Theorem II.16.5]). The implicit -stage Gauss methods of
order 2 are symplectic for all .

Appendix C. Runge-Kutta methods

219

The characteristic feature of all of symplectic RK methods is summarized in the

following theorem
Theorem 2 ([83, p. 316, Theorem II.16.6]). If the  √ó  matrix  with elements  =
 + ‚àí, (,  = 1, ‚Ä¶ , ) satisÔ¨Åes  = 0, then the Runge-Kutta (C.2) method
is symplectic.
An important implication of this theorem is that the ERK methods are never sym-
plectic. Moreover the most familiar classes of IRK (Radau IA and IIA, or Lobatto IIIA,
IIIB and IIIC methods) are also not symplectic. Although, the Lobatto IIIA-IIIB pair,
composed into partitioned Runge-Kutta method (see below) play important role as it
generalizes the St√∂rmer-Verlet scheme [82].
The important property of symplectic methods is preservation of the Hamiltonian
and other Ô¨Årst integrals.
Theorem 3 ([83, p. 319, Theorem II.16.7]). Denote  = (, ) and let  be a symmetric
2 √ó 2 matrix. A symplectic Runge-Kutta method leaves all quadratic Ô¨Årst integrals

The idea behind (C.20) is to take two RK methods, and to treat the -variables with
the Ô¨Årst method (with coeÔ¨Écients , ), and the -variables with the second method
(coeÔ¨Écients ƒÆ, ƒÆ). The following theorem gives the condition for symplecticity of
(C.20)

Theorem 4 ([83, p. 326, Theorem II.16.10]). (a) If the coeÔ¨Écients of (C.20) satisfy
(C.21)
(C.22)

 = ƒÆ,
 ƒÆ + ƒÆ ‚àí  ƒÆ = 0,

(i,j=1,...,s) then the method (C.20) is symplectic.

(b) If the Hamiltonian is separable then the condition (C.22) alone implies symplectic-

ity of the method.
In particular, for separable Hamiltonian systems

(, ) =  () +  (),

(C.23)
it is possible to obtain explicit symplectic methods. If the PRK method (C.20) consist
of diagonally implicit and explicit methods
 = 0,
ƒÆ = 0,

(C.24)
respectively, then the resulting scheme is explicit. Moreover, assuming  ‡£î 0 and
ƒÆ ‡£î 0 ( = 1, ‚Ä¶ , ) without loss of generality, then the symplecticity condition (C.22)
becomes

Interaction coeÔ¨Écients

In this chapter we brieÔ¨Çy review methods we use to calculate integrals (interaction co-
eÔ¨Écients) appearing in perturbative calculations.

D.1 General formula
In perturbative calculations we need to expand diÔ¨Äerent quantities into a linear combi-
nation of eigenfunctions themselves (the interaction coeÔ¨Écients). This requires com-
putation of integrals of products of eigenfunctions. Let assume (for generality) that
there is a given set of orthogonal functions () on a interval [, ] ‡£™ R with a weight

Because the eigenbasis functions () which we encounter here are polynomials in
cos  we reduce the integrand (D.2) to the sum of the cosine and sine products. Then
if this integral is convergent (which we assume is true) we make use of the Euler beta
